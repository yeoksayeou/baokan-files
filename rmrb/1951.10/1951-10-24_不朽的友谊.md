    Immortal Friendship
    A year ago, when we crossed the Yalu River Bridge with anger towards the American armed aggressors, I heard a moving voice: "Take as much grain as possible! We are going to help the Korean people liberate themselves, and we must not increase the burden on the Korean people." This was said by a volunteer soldier carrying a rifle. This is an ordinary sentence, but it shows what a great and selfless spirit the victorious Chinese people have in assisting the fraternal ally—the Korean people—in their anti-aggression struggle.
    In every smoke-filled trench, from the letters of guarantee and determination sent like snowflakes to the commanders, I saw the volunteer soldiers writing such firm vows: "We must cherish every mountain, river, grass, and tree of the Korean people as we cherish our own motherland." I also heard them shouting angrily thousands of times: "Avenge the Korean people!" It was with this will that our soldiers selflessly helped the Korean people to take back their survival and freedom from the aggressors.
    In a battle last winter, a unit of the Volunteer Army was ordered to block the retreating enemy in a village. A group of figures was moving in front. The soldiers pressed the triggers of their machine guns, pulled the pins of their grenades, and waited tensely in the ice and snow. But as the group gradually approached, the soldiers were stunned. It turned out that at the front were a group of Korean people, including old people, children, and women carrying babies, followed by enemy tanks, and behind them were trucks loaded with enemy troops. The soldiers looked anxiously at the commander. The commander frowned. If they opened fire, these old people, children, and women would immediately become victims of the enemy's poisonous scheme; if they didn't, the mission would not be accomplished. The commander suddenly stood up from the fortifications, waved the pistol in his hand, and shouted loudly to the soldiers: "We must rescue these folks! Comrades, fix bayonets! Charge at the enemy!" The machine gun fired a signal for the charge into the air, and the soldiers, with their bayonets fixed, charged straight down from the snow-covered mountains, irresistibly rushing into the enemy ranks, thrusting their sharp bayonets into the enemy's chests. After a brief but intense melee, the enemy was finally annihilated, and not a single Korean was injured, but several of our soldiers were killed or wounded as a result. The chairman of the Labor Party of a certain place in Korea told me this story. His eyes filled with tears as he said, "Such an army will never be forgotten by the Korean people for generations to come."
    During the years of war, the volunteer soldiers cared for the lives of the Korean people as they cared for their own. In one battle, the Korean residents of a village near the front line fled to the mountains and forests, leaving behind silkworms about to spin silk and ripe crops. When the volunteer soldiers saw this, they said, "This is the hard work of the Korean people! If they can't harvest the crops, how will they survive the winter?" After repelling the enemy's attack, they worked together to harvest the crops and pick mulberry leaves to feed the silkworms. The soldiers were concerned about every town destroyed by enemy planes and every village burned by the enemy. They were concerned about the Korean people rebuilding their homes after the war. They often said, "If the Korean people need it after the war, we will help them rebuild." When building bridges, the soldiers would rather go to the deep mountains to cut down new wood than use a single piece of wood or a brick from the villages, even though these villages had been bombed into ruins and the people had long fled to the rear. The soldiers said, "It's not easy for the Korean folks to build houses; every piece of wood and brick will be precious after the victory." This deep love for the Korean people shows the noble quality of internationalism of our soldiers.
    The Korean people's gratitude to the Volunteer Army is growing day by day. When the Volunteer Army first appeared on the Korean battlefield, the Korean people praised the Volunteer Army as "Two Classes" troops, meaning that the Volunteer Army fought bravely and had strict discipline. After a year of fighting, a deep friendship as close as flesh and blood has grown between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people. The volunteer soldiers are called "Volunteer Army Uncles" by Korean children, "Good Brothers" by young people, and "Children" by old people. The consistent name of the Korean people for the Volunteer Army is "Our Army." The use of the word "our" between two nations is unusual. This is the crystallization of the immortal friendship strengthened between the Chinese and Korean peoples in the victorious struggle against the common enemy.
    I have visited many heroes wearing "Military Medals" awarded by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They believe that receiving such a medal is the most glorious event in their lives. They are determined to dedicate everything they have, including their precious lives, to the noble cause of resisting the American aggressors and to the Korean people's struggle for independence and freedom.
    In the past year, every drop of blood shed by our soldiers on the Korean land has been repaid double to the American murderers, and has recorded an immortal page in the history of the anti-aggression struggle of the Chinese and Korean peoples.

### 不朽的友谊

    不朽的友谊
    新华社记者  耐因
    一年之前，当我们怀着对美国武装侵略者的愤怒跨过鸭绿江大桥的时候，我听到一种令人感动的声音：“粮食尽量多带呀！我们是去帮助朝鲜人民解放的，不要增加朝鲜人民的负担。”这是一位背着步枪的志愿军战士说的。这是一句平凡的话，但是，它却说明了：胜利了的中国人民是怀着怎样伟大的无私的心情来援助亲密的友邦——朝鲜人民反侵略斗争的。
    在每一处硝烟弥漫的战壕里，从雪片似地送到指挥员手中的保证书与决心书中，我看到志愿军战士们写着这样坚决的誓言：“我们要爱护朝鲜人民的一山一水、一草一木，像爱护我们自己祖国一样。”我也千百次地听到他们这样愤怒地高呼：“为朝鲜人民复仇！”我们的战士就是怀抱着这样的意志，奋不顾身地帮助朝鲜人民，从侵略者手里夺回生存和自由。
    在去年冬天的某次战斗中，志愿军的一支部队奉命在一个村庄上堵击南逃的敌人。前面一群人影在移动过来了，战士们按住了机关枪的板机，拨出了手榴弹的弦圈，伏在冰雪里紧张地等待着。但当这群人渐渐移近的时候，战士们都楞住了。原来在最前面出现的是一群朝鲜人民，里面有老年人、小孩与背着婴儿的妇女，跟在后面的是敌人的坦克，再往后才是一卡车一卡车的敌军。战士们焦急地瞧着指挥员，指挥员皱着眉，开枪吧，这些老人、孩子和妇女立即会作敌人毒计下的牺牲品；不打呢，任务就完不成。指挥员猛然地从工事里站起来，挥动着手里的驳壳枪，向战士们大声发出命令：“我们要把这些老乡抢救出来，同志们，上刺刀！向敌人冲呀！”机关枪朝空中响起了冲锋的信号，战士们端着刺刀从满盖冰雪的山岭上直冲下去，猛不可挡地杀进敌群，把锋利的刺刀戳进了敌人的胸膛。经过短促的激烈肉搏战，敌人最后被歼灭了，朝鲜人民一个也没有伤着，我们的战士为此多伤亡了几个人。对我讲述这个事迹的是一位朝鲜某地劳动党的委员长。他眼睛里含着泪水说：“这样的军队，朝鲜人子孙万代永远不会忘记的。”
    在战争的岁月里，志愿军战士们像关心自己祖国人民一样地关心朝鲜人民的生活。在有一次战役中，战线附近村庄的朝鲜居民们远避到山林里去了，丢下了将要吐丝的蚕和已经熟了的庄稼。志愿军战士见了后说：“这都是朝鲜老乡们的血汗啊！收不了庄稼，他们怎么过冬呢？”他们在打退敌人的进攻之后，就一起动手收割庄稼，采桑喂蚕。战士们关心每一个被敌机炸毁的城镇和敌人焚毁的村庄，他们关心将来战争胜利后朝鲜人民重建家园。他们时常这样说：“待将来战争结束后，如果朝鲜人民需要的话，我们还要帮助他们恢复建设。”在架设桥梁的时候，战士们宁可到深山里去砍伐新木，而不去动用村镇上的一根木头与一块砖瓦；虽然这些村镇已被炸成废墟，人们早已远避后方。战士们说：“朝鲜老乡盖房子可不容易啊；一木一砖到胜利以后都是很宝贵的。”这种对朝鲜人民的深爱，显示了我们的战士国际主义的高贵品质。
    朝鲜人民对志愿军的感谢是与日俱增的。在志愿军才出现在朝鲜战场上的时候，朝鲜人民称誉志愿军为“两班”部队，意思说志愿军打仗英勇、纪律严明。经过一年间战斗的岁月，志愿军与朝鲜人民之间更加生长起亲如骨肉的深厚情谊。志愿军战士们被朝鲜孩子们叫“志愿军叔叔”，被年青人喊着
    “好兄弟”，被老年人叫着“孩子们”。朝鲜人民对志愿军一致的称呼是“我们的军队”。“我们”这两个字用在两个民族之间是不寻常的，这是中朝人民在对共同的敌人的胜利斗争中加强起来的不朽的友谊的结晶。
    我曾访问过许多胸佩朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府颁赠的“军功章”的英雄。他们认为获得这样的奖章是他们一生最光荣的事件。他们立志把自己的
    一切，包括宝贵的生命，贡献于反抗美国侵略者的崇高事业，贡献于朝鲜人民为独立与自由的斗争。
    一年间，我们的战士在朝鲜土地上所流的每一滴血，都曾向美国杀人凶手讨还了加倍的偿价，并在中朝人民反侵略斗争史上记下永垂不朽的一页。
