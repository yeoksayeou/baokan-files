Reader's Letter

    To the Editor:
    These past few days, I have seen news in the paper about women being abused to death or forced to commit suicide. I feel there is a specific reason, overlooked by everyone, why some women cannot escape death: such women, when they file for divorce from their husbands and face the possibility of being abused to death, cannot get effective protection. Because they are abused, they want a divorce, or have already filed for divorce, but cannot find a safe place to live. Some have no maternal family, some have maternal families far away, some maternal families won't take them in, and some maternal families are also unsafe. If the maternal family is like this, there's no point even talking about other families, right? If they can't live here and can't live there, where can they live? They live with their husbands. Please think about it, problems arise because they can't live with their husbands, and when problems arise, they still live with their husbands. What's the difference between this and putting meat in a tiger's mouth? Not long after the Marriage Law was promulgated, some women petitioned the court for divorce, and the court told them to take the summons for their husbands back to their husbands (supposedly because there was no one to deliver it). She took it back, and as a result, she was killed by her husband that night. From this incident, we can see how much the women trust our government and the dignity of the law, while some of our cadres are bureaucratic and don't think of ways to guarantee the safety of women seeking divorce, but instead send them into the tiger's mouth.
    If we want women to be able to escape suffering through the Marriage Law, I think one of the specific tasks is to think of various ways to guarantee the safety of oppressed women in advance. For women seeking divorce, first of all, we must provide them with a place to stay for a few days, so that the women are first in a safe zone, and so that the women are in an equal position with their husbands in terms of safety, before handling the divorce proceedings.

### 给要离婚的妇女以安全保障

    给要离婚的妇女以安全保障编辑同志：
    这几天我看到报上关于妇女被虐杀或被迫自杀的消息，觉得有些妇女之所以不能不死，里面有一个被大家所忽视的具体原因，就是那样的妇女，在向夫家提出离婚、有被虐杀可能时，却得不到有效保障。她们因为被虐待，要离婚，或者已经提出了离婚，可是找不到安全的地方住。有的没有娘家，有的娘家远，有的娘家也不叫住，有的娘家也住不安稳。娘家尚且如此，别的什么人家还用得着谈么？这里不能住，那里不能住，住在什么地方呢？住在夫家。请想想看，因为夫家住不下去才发生问题，发生问题了还是住在夫家，这和把肉放在老虎口边有什么分别？在婚姻法颁布不久的时候，有的妇女向法院请求离婚，法院就叫她把传她丈夫的传票带回给她的丈夫（据说因为没有人送）。她带回去了，结果，当夜就被丈夫杀死了。从这件事看起来，妇女们是怎样相信我们的政府和法律的尊严，而我们有些干部却是官僚主义分子，他们不想办法保障要离婚妇女的安全，却把她们送进了虎口。
    要让妇女通过婚姻法解除痛苦，我认为具体工作之一，就是要想各种办法事先保障受压迫妇女的安全。对于要离婚的妇女，首先就要使她们有一个住几天的地方，让妇女先站在安全地带了，让妇女在安全这一点上说，是处于和丈夫同等的地位了，再办理离婚手续。
