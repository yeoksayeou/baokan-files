    Neglecting Disaster Relief Efforts Results in Severe Losses
    CCP Hua County Committee Conducts Self-Criticism
    And Determines Steps to Implement the Production-Based Disaster Relief Policy
    Following the criticism of the Hua County leading cadres' error of neglecting disaster relief work in this newspaper's "Party Life Brief Comments" column on October 7th and in the Pingyuan Daily, the CCP Hua County Committee immediately conducted a review and convened a cadre meeting to seriously discuss the policy, methods, and steps for implementing production-based disaster relief.
    The CCP Hua County Committee first acknowledged that it had an insufficient understanding of the county's severe disaster situation. Therefore, it failed to criticize and correct erroneous ideas among cadres such as "Flooding is a line, drought is a large area, flooding is always better than drought, the crops that weren't flooded this year are all bumper harvests, leading or not leading production-based disaster relief doesn't matter." Secondly, the Hua County Committee reviewed its bureaucratic attitude of not caring enough about the suffering of the masses, failing to see that many disaster victims are already running out of food and starving, and their emotions are extremely unstable; failing to recognize that if action isn't taken as soon as possible, the future disaster will be even more severe, its losses will be even greater, and it will seriously affect future production and construction. Instead, it one-sidedly believed: "The masses are busy with autumn harvesting and wheat planting, and can't bother with sideline occupations. It won't be too late to carry out disaster relief after the masses have planted the wheat, and it doesn't matter if there's a disaster now." As a result, the disaster situation became increasingly serious.
    The Hua County Committee pointed out in its review that it had previously one-sidedly emphasized that the county was too large, there were too few cadres, and there were too many difficulties, and used the excuse that some villages were suppressing counter-revolutionaries, so it did not do as the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government's production-based disaster relief instructions pointed out, namely that disaster areas should make production-based disaster relief the overriding central task, but instead put most of its efforts into the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. It also failed to study and implement the important tasks repeatedly emphasized in the disaster relief instructions, such as "guaranteeing that no one starves to death," "preventing disaster victims from being displaced," and "maintaining the productive vitality of disaster areas." This is a kind of disorganized and undisciplined behavior.
    As a result of the County Committee's neglect of production-based disaster relief work, disaster victims have sold more than 1,000 head of livestock, the emotions of the masses are unstable, social order is uneasy, theft cases have increased, and some disaster victims have fallen ill. According to statistics from 33 villages, more than 100 people have died. The Hua County Committee believes that it should bear full responsibility for these serious losses.
    After the above review and a detailed study of the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government's disaster relief instructions, the Hua County Committee affirmed that disaster relief work should become the overriding central task, and decided that county and district responsible cadres should personally take action, go deep into villages and households, and lead the masses to implement self-reliance through production. In addition, the County Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Prefectural Committee, convened an enlarged meeting of county and district cadres, reviewed the various erroneous ideas about disaster relief work, implemented the production-based disaster relief policy, and determined several specific measures: First, it was suggested that the government convene people's representative meetings and village cadre meetings at all levels to effectively implement the disaster relief policies and guidelines among the masses, stabilize the emotions of the masses, and establish confidence in self-reliance through production. Second, improve disaster relief organizations at all levels. Party secretaries at all levels should personally participate in leading disaster relief work. Third, clarify the disaster situation and formulate specific plans for production-based disaster relief.

    忽视救灾工作造成严重损失
    中共滑县县委会进行检讨
    并确定贯彻生产救灾方针的步骤
    自本报十月七日“党的生活简评”栏及平原日报批评了滑县领导干部忽视救灾工作的错误后，中共滑县县委会即进行了检查，并召开干部会议，认真讨论了贯彻生产救灾的方针、方法和步骤。
    中共滑县县委首先承认了对该县严重的灾情认识不足。因此对于干部中的“淹是一条线，旱是一大片，淹总比旱强，今年没淹的庄稼都是丰收，生产救灾领导不领导没啥”等错误思想未能给以批判与纠正。其次，滑县县委会检讨了对群众疾苦不够关心的官僚主义态度，看不到目前已有不少灾民断炊饿肚子，情绪极为不稳；不认识如不及早动手，将来的灾荒更为严重，其损失会更大，将严重地影响到今后的生产建设。而片面地认为：“群众正在忙于收秋种麦，顾不得搞副业，等群众种上麦子以后再搞救灾也晚不了，现在有灾也不要紧。”以致使灾情越来越严重。
    滑县县委检讨中提出，过去曾片面地强调本县地区太大，干部缺少，困难太多，并且藉口有部分村子正在镇压反革命，以致没有按照平原省委、省府生产救灾指示中所指出的去做，即灾区应以生产救灾为压倒一切的中心任务，却把大部分力量放在镇压反革命工作上。对救灾指示中再三强调的“保证不饿死一个人”，“不使灾民流离失所”，“保持灾区的生产元气”等重大任务，也没有研究、执行。这是一种无组织无纪律的行为。
    县委忽视生产救灾工作的结果，灾民已将牲口卖掉一千多头，群众情绪不稳，社会秩序不安，偷盗案件增多，一部分灾民病倒，据三十三个村统计，已死亡百余人。这些严重的损失，滑县县委认为应负完全责任。
    经过以上检查并详细研究了平原省委、省府的救灾指示，滑县县委会肯定了救灾工作应成为压倒一切的中心工作，决定县区负责干部要亲自动手，深入村户，领导群众实行生产自救。另外，县委又根据地委指示，召开了县区干部扩大会议，检查了对救灾工作的种种错误思想，贯彻了生产救灾的方针，并确定了几项具体措施：一、建议政府召开各界人民代表会和村干部会，切实将救灾政策与方针贯彻到群众中去，稳定群众情绪，树立生产自救信心。二、健全各级救灾组织。各级党委书记应亲自参加领导救灾工作。三、澄清灾情，订出生产救灾的具体计划。
