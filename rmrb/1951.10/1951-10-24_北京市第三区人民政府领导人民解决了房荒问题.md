    The Third District People's Government of Beijing Leads the People to Solve the Housing Shortage Problem
    The Third District of Beijing is gradually solving the housing shortage problem. Over the past year, under the leadership of the District Housing Repair and Protection Committee, landlords and tenants jointly repaired 12,894 leaking and collapsed houses; the Third District People's Government also built 407 new houses. The households with the most serious housing problems have now moved into new houses. After moving into the new house, military dependent Old Lady Zhang was extremely excited. She said, "The government has solved my most difficult problem today. I will definitely write to my son and ask him to make meritorious contributions to the people." Zhao Wensheng's family, whose original house was in danger of collapsing at any time, has also moved into a new house.
    Looking at these new houses, the families of revolutionary martyrs and the citizens realize from the bottom of their hearts: "The People's Government is truly our own government."

    北京市第三区人民政府领导人民解决了房荒问题
    北京市第三区逐步解决房荒问题。一年来，在区房屋修缮保护委员会领导下，房东、房客共修好了一万二千八百九十四间渗漏及倒塌的房屋；第三区人民政府并建筑了四百零七间新房。房屋问题最严重的住户，现在都搬进了新房。军属张老太太搬进新房后，极为兴奋，她说：“政府今天把我最困难的问题解决了，我一定给我儿子去信，叫他好好为人民立功。”市民赵文声家原先住的房子随时都有倒塌的危险，现在他也搬进了新房。
    眼看着这些新房子，烈军属们、市民们从心底体会到：“人民政府真正是自己的政府。”
