    Xia'an Village Militia Captures Cotton Yarn Thieves, Yuci Cotton Yarn Company Sends Letter of Commendation
To the Editor:
    Our company was transporting cotton yarn from Zhengtai Railway to Tangshan. On July 26th, when passing through Xia'an Station in Jingxing County, Hebei Province, due to the carelessness of the escort cadre Wang Laiqing, a rogue named Liu Erxiao stole a package of cotton yarn, totaling twenty pieces. Liu Erxiao transported the stolen goods to near the lime kiln in Xia'an Village, where his suspicious behavior was discovered by the militia. After contacting our company, we retrieved the lost cotton yarn. Afterwards, our company sent cadres to Xia'an Village and presented militia captain Liang Xizi and others with bonuses, fountain pens, and other items, as well as a banner with the inscription "Model of Protecting National Property" to the district, to express our respect. After the incident, the district and village cadres held a meeting and unanimously stated that "we must further improve road protection and anti-theft work and never allow the people's property to be damaged." This spirit of patriotism is worthy of learning.

    下安村民兵查住偷盗棉纱犯  榆次花纱布分公司来信表扬编辑同志：
    本公司由正太路向唐山运送棉纱，七月二十六日途经河北井陉县下安站时，由于押车干部王来庆麻痹大意，被流氓刘二小偷去棉纱一包计二十块。刘二小偷运至下安村白灰窑附近，因行迹可疑，被民兵查获。经联络本公司即取回丢失棉纱。之后，本公司派干部前往下安村，赠予民兵队长梁喜子等奖金、水笔等，并赠该区“爱护国家财物的楷模”锦旗一面，以表示我们的敬意。该区、村干部于事后开会时，一致表示“要更进一步作好护路防盗工作，决不使人民财产受到损失”。这种爱国主义的精神，值得学习。
