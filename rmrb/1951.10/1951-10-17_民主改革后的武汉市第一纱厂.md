The democratic reform movement in Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill has strengthened the unity of workers, rectified the trade union organization, and greatly improved workers' enthusiasm and sense of responsibility in production.

The lack of unity among the employees of the mill was a historical problem. Before liberation, the staff of the mill relied on coercion to manage production. They looked down on the workers and were in opposition to them. This phenomenon had not been completely eliminated after liberation. Due to the long-term influence of counter-revolutionaries and feudal remnants in creating sectarian struggles among the workers, the lack of unity among the workers themselves was also widespread. After the anti-feudal struggle phase ended, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party in the mill led all employees in a democratic unity movement centered on production issues and based primarily on criticism and self-criticism, which basically solved the internal relations issues of the working class. The phenomenon of workers in various workshops arguing, which was common in the past, has been eliminated. Now, opinions can be discussed in group meetings. Some groups have also developed plans for unity and mutual assistance. In the past, workers called staff members "sir" and did not interact with them, but this phenomenon has changed. Several management personnel who had a bad relationship with the workers in the past have been forgiven by the workers after making self-criticisms and admitting their mistakes. For example, Xia Qinghai, the workshop director of the Finished Products Packaging Department in the South Factory, and Weng Zhiqing, the yarn-winding room manager, had a very poor relationship with the workers, but they made profound self-criticisms during the democratic unity movement, so the workers cast many votes for them during the re-election of the trade union. Some factory directors used to visit the workshop only once every three or four days, but now they go to the workshop every day to study or solve production problems with the workers. In the past, some workers had a general understanding of the Communist Party, but they could not understand some Communist Party members in the factory who had bad work styles. Now, they see that these Communist Party members are not only hardworking in their work, but also willing to accept criticism when they have shortcomings, and thus further trust the Communist Party. Many workers now regard joining the Communist Party as their goal.

After the democratic reform movement, the trade union organization of the mill was also thoroughly rectified, making the trade union a truly working-class organization. The main cadres of the mill's trade union committee were mostly underground Communist Party members before liberation, and had close ties with the workers, which enabled the mill's trade union organization to make many achievements since liberation. However, on the other hand, the trade union was not strict enough in developing its organization, which led to the entry of many feudal and reactionary elements, some of whom even seized the leadership of the workshop trade union committees and trade union groups, and a few even infiltrated the factory trade union committee. These feudal and reactionary elements used their power to continue to oppress the workers, sow discord, and obstruct the connection between the trade union leadership and the workers. For example, Xu Yuzhen, a feudal boss in the fine spinning room of the North Factory, controlled the workshop trade union committee member Shen Huangshi after joining the trade union. Every time Shen Huangshi returned from a meeting, she had to consult with Xu Yuzhen before conveying the information to the workers, and workers who applied to join the trade union also had to seek Xu's consent first. Due to the control of feudal and reactionary elements, more than 700 workers in the mill were still attached to more than a dozen feudal organizations such as the Qing Gang, the Red Gang, the "Twenty-Eight Constellations," and the "Thirty-Six Friends" before the rectification of the trade union organization. When rectifying the trade union organization, the mill first dealt with a group of feudal and reactionary elements with definite evidence based on the accusations of the workers, including 103 who were expelled from membership and more than 100 who were suspended from membership for one month to half a year. In addition, the positions of more than 29 trade union cadres above the group leader level were also removed by the workers with the approval of the factory trade union because they were seriously infected with feudal ideas. In addition, more than 400 members confessed to their past history of participating in reactionary parties, groups, and feudal gangs. On the basis of this rectified team, the mill carried out the re-election of trade unions at all levels. In the re-election, trade union cadres who only talked and did not act, and were not supported by the majority of employees, were eliminated. As a result of the election, two-thirds of the 355 trade union cadres elected in the mill (excluding group leaders) were newly emerged activists in the democratic reform movement, and the other one-third were re-elected trade union cadres who had been attacked by feudal and reactionary elements. As a result of the rectification of the trade union organization, the connection between the trade union leadership and the workers has been greatly strengthened. The number of activists under the leadership of the trade union has now increased by more than two times compared with before the rectification of the organization. Many workers who used to bury themselves in production and did not care about politics are now actively involved. For example, Huang Guangshan, an old technician in the maintenance department of the South Factory, used to only repair machines and was unwilling to participate in political activities, but now he can take the lead in movements such as saving and donating weapons. Qian Dagu, a worker in the fine spinning room of the North Factory, used to think that activists were just trying to show off, but after the activists led the struggle to overthrow Yang Furong, a feudal boss who had oppressed her, she changed her understanding and took the initiative to talk to the activists, review her shortcomings, and expressed her desire to learn from the activists, and urgently requested the activists to help her make progress. The general workers are also actively approaching the trade union organization. More than 100 employees in the mill who had not requested to join the trade union for more than two years have now applied for membership. In the past, when the trade union held meetings, workers and even some trade union cadres often did not arrive on time. Now, even workers who live the farthest from the factory rarely arrive late even when meetings are held on holidays. In the past, when workshop trade union committee members conveyed the tasks of the trade union, the workers were mostly impatient to listen, but now they hope to hear more and in more detail.

When the mill launched a patriotic labor competition last November, it had established some production responsibility systems, but because these systems were only established from top to bottom, and were not consciously supported by the workers due to the influence of feudal and reactionary forces, they became a mere formality, and the phenomenon of no one being responsible for production was still very serious, and the workers were not united because they shirked responsibility. When the democratic reform movement entered the stage of democratic construction, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party in the mill first led the workers to establish production responsibility systems such as shift handover and finished product inspection, and signed contact contracts. After the administrative side of the mill formulated draft versions of various systems and submitted them to the workers for discussion, the workers not only put forward many revisions and supplements, but also generally developed plans to ensure the implementation of the systems. After these systems were established, the mill's production, savings, and product quality have all been significantly improved. For example, the oiling workers in the South Factory used to sit in the tool room and did not repair the machines in time, so they often left broken machines for the next shift. Now, they can automatically patrol the workshop, repair broken machines as soon as they are found, and ensure that no broken machines are left for the next shift. In the past, some machines in the fine spinning room often experienced shift breaks (that is, the workers who were leaving had already left, but the workers who were coming on shift had not yet arrived). Now, the workers who are taking over can generally arrive ten minutes early and take over conscientiously. Due to the establishment of the production responsibility system, the return flowers in the workshops of the North Factory have been reduced from 20% of the cotton used to 7%, and the leather roller flowers in the fine spinning room have also been reduced by 40% to 80%. In September, the average unit output of 20-count yarn per 20 hours in the mill increased from 0.73 pounds in August to 0.778 pounds. (Xinhua News Agency)

    民主改革后的武汉市第一纱厂
    武汉市第一纱厂开展民主改革运动的结果，加强了职工团结，整顿了工会组织，工人生产积极性和责任心也大大提高。
    该厂职工内部不够团结是一个历史性的问题。该厂职员在解放前是靠强迫命令来管理生产的。他们轻视工人，和工人处于对立状态；解放后这种现象仍未彻底消除。由于反革命分子与封建残余分子在工人群众中长期制造宗派斗争的影响，工人和工人间的不团结现象也很普遍。当反封建斗争阶段结束后，该厂中共总支委员会就领导全厂职工展开了一个以生产问题为中心、以批评与自我批评为主要方式的民主团结运动，基本上解决了工人阶级内部的关系问题。从前各车间工人中普遍存在的吵架现象已被消除，现在有了意见都能在小组会上进行检讨。有的小组还订立了团结互助计划。从前工人们把职员叫做“先生”而互不往来，现在这种现象已有了改变。若干过去和工人关系很坏的管理人员，经过自我批评承认错误后，已得到工人的谅解。例如：南厂成包部车间主任夏清海、摇纱间管理员翁知庆和工人的关系原很恶劣，但他们在民主团结运动中深刻地进行了自我批评，因此在改选工会时，工人们就投了他们很多的票。有的厂主任过去三、四天不到车间一回，现在每天都到车间和工人们研究或解决生产中的问题。从前部分工人虽对共产党有一般认识，但对厂里某些作风不好的共产党员却不能理解；现在他们看到这些共产党员不仅在工作上辛勤努力，而且有了缺点又能接受批评，因而进
    一步信任共产党。许多工人现已把参加共产党作为自己的努力目标。
    经过民主改革运动，该厂工会组织也得到比较彻底的整顿，使工会真正成了工人阶级自己的组织。该厂工会委员会的主要干部多是解放前的中共地下党员，和工人群众有着密切的联系，因而使该厂工会组织在解放以来作出了很多工作成绩。但另一方面，由于工会发展组织时不够严密，以致有不少的封建反动分子混了进来，有的还攫取了车间工会委员会和工会小组的领导权，个别的甚至混进了厂工会委员会。这些封建反动分子利用职权继续压迫工人，挑拨离间，阻挠工会领导与工人群众的联系。例如北厂细纱间封建头佬徐玉珍混入工会后，即控制车间工会委员沈黄氏。沈黄氏每次开会回来，都要先和徐玉珍商量后才能向工人传达，工人申请入会，也要先征求徐的同意。由于封建反动分子的控制，该厂有七百多工人直到整顿工会组织前还依附在青帮、红帮、“二十八宿”、“三十六友”等十几种封建组织中。该厂在整顿工会组织时，首先根据工人群众的检举，分别处理了确有实据的一批封建反动分子，计开除会籍者一百零三人，停止会籍自一个月至半年者一百多人。此外，有二十九个小组长以上的工会干部，因沾染封建思想比较严重，也由工人提出经厂工会批准被罢免了职务。此外，有四百多名会员交代了过去参加反动党团和封建帮派的历史。在经过这一整顿队伍的基础之上，该厂进行了各级工会的改选。在改选中，向来只说不做、不为大多数职工所拥护的工会干部都被淘汰了；选举结果，全厂当选的三百五十五个工会干部中（不包括小组长在内），即有三分之二是在民主改革运动中新涌现的积极分子，另外三分之一是重新当选的原来为封建反动分子所打击的工会干部。整顿工会组织的结果，工会领导与工人群众的联系已大为加强。现在在工会领导下的积极分子的数目比整顿组织前增加了两倍以上。过去很多只埋头生产而不问政治的工人，现在都积极起来了。例如南厂保全部老技工黄广山，过去就是只管修车，不愿参加政治活动的人，但现在已能在节约储蓄、捐献武器等运动中起带头作用。北厂细纱间工人钱大姑以前认为积极分子只是为了出风头，但在这次由积极分子带头斗倒了压迫过她的封建头佬杨芙荣以后，就改变了认识，主动地找积极分子谈话，检讨她的缺点，表示要向积极分子学习，并迫切要求积极分子帮助她进步。一般工人群众也积极地向工会组织靠拢。全厂一百多名两年多以来未曾要求加入工会组织的职工，现在已纷纷申请入会。以前工会召开会议时，工人群众甚至有些工会干部都常常不按时到会，现在连住得离厂最远的工人即使在例假日开会也很少迟到。过去车间工会委员传达工会工作任务时，工人们大多不耐烦听，现在却希望多讲些、讲详细一点。
    该厂在去年十一月展开爱国主义劳动竞赛时，曾建立过一些生产责任制度，但因为这些制度只是自上而下地建立，在封建反动势力影响下，不能得到工人群众的自觉的支持，以致流于形式，生产上无人负责的现象仍甚严重，工人们且因为互相推诿责任而不团结。当民主改革运动进入民主建设阶段后，该厂中共总支委员会即首先领导工人建立交接班、成品检查等生产责任制度，并签订联系合同。该厂行政方面制订出各种制度的草案交工人群众讨论后，工人们不但提出了很多修正和补充意见，而且普遍订出了保证执行制度的计划。这些制度建立后，该厂生产、节约以及产品质量等各方面都获得了显著改进。例如南厂加油工人，以前老是坐在工具间里，不及时修理而经常留坏车子交班；现在已能自动地在车间里巡回，发现坏车随即修理，保证不留坏车交班。细纱间以前有些车子时常脱班（即下班的已走而上班的还没来），现在接班的一般都能早到十分钟，认真接班。由于生产责任制的建立，北厂各车间的回花已由占用棉量的百分之二十减少到百分之七，细纱间的皮辊花也已减少了百分之四十到八十。九月份全厂二十支纱每二十小时的平均单位产量，已由八月份的零点七三磅提高到零点七七八磅。（新华社）
