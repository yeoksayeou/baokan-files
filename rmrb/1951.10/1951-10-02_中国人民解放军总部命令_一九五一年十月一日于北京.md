Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
October 1, 1951, Beijing

Comrades Commanders, Fighters, Political Workers, and Logistics Workers of the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Comrades Militiamen:

Today marks the second anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic of China. In these two years, our great motherland has achieved brilliant victories and accomplishments. We have completely liberated the mainland of the motherland. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people voluntarily organized the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, safeguarded the security of the motherland, struck at the American imperialist aggressors, and achieved great victories. We have carried out a large-scale land reform movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and bandit suppression operations, further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and safeguarding national construction. We have stabilized prices, restored industry and commerce, and brought agricultural production to pre-Anti-Japanese War levels. Our cultural and educational undertakings have also made significant developments and progress. These are the results of the united struggle of the people and the army across the country. I extend my warm congratulations to you and express my gratitude and appreciation.

However, we must see that American imperialism is extremely hostile to the victory of the Chinese people and unwilling to accept its defeat. Not only does it still occupy our Taiwan, and do everything possible to undermine and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, continuing its war of aggression against Korea, but it is also actively preparing for a new war. It blatantly disregards the opposition of the people of the world and coerces its puppet countries into signing a unilateral peace treaty with Japan. It openly re-arms Japan and West Germany. The crisis of war is seriously threatening the security of our motherland and the peace of the East and the world. To this end, I order you to be vigilant in your combat posts, further strengthen national defense construction, and consolidate the national defense of the motherland. Study diligently without complacency, master new technologies, learn the skills of joint operations of various services and arms, improve the level of modern military science and command art, strengthen the planning, organization and accuracy of various tasks, consolidate and improve military discipline, and strive to build a strong and modern national defense force! Strive to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and other islands, and complete the great cause of unifying the whole of China! Strive to defend the security of the motherland, defend the sacred territory, territorial waters, and airspace of the motherland! Strive to defend the peace of the East and the world!

Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!
Long live the great unity of the Asian people!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
Long live the People's Republic

    中国人民解放军总部命令
    一九五一年十月一日于北京
    中国人民解放军陆军、空军、海军、公安部队全体指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员同志们，民兵同志们：
    我们中华人民共和国成立到今天，已经两周年了。在这两年中间，我们伟大的祖国获得了辉煌的胜利和成就。我们已经完全解放了祖国的大陆。中国人民的优秀儿女，志愿组织了中国人民志愿军，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，保障了祖国的安全，打击了美帝国主义侵略者，取得了巨大的胜利。我们进行了巨大规模的土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动和剿匪作战，进一步地巩固了人民民主专政，保障了国家建设，我们稳定了物价，恢复了工商业，并使农业产量达到抗日战争前的水平。我们的文化教育事业，也有了显著的发展和进步。这些都是全国军民团结一致共同奋斗的结果，我特向你们热烈地祝贺，并表示感谢和慰问。
    但是我们必须看到，美帝国主义极端仇视中国人民的胜利，不甘心于自己的失败，它不仅仍然侵占着我国的台湾，百般地破坏阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，继续着对朝鲜的侵略战争，并且在积极地准备新的战争。它悍然不顾全世界人民的反对，胁使其仆从国家，签订了片面对日和约。它公然地重新武装日本和西德。战争危机在严重地威胁着我们祖国的安全，和东方与世界的和平。为此，我命令你们，警惕地站好你们的战斗岗位，进一步加强国防建设，巩固祖国国防。毫不满足地认真学习，熟练掌握新的技术，学会诸兵种联合作战的本领，提高现代军事科学和指挥艺术的水平，加强各种工作的计划性、组织性和准确性，巩固和提高军事纪律，为建设一支强大的现代化国防军而奋斗！为解放台湾、澎湖、金门诸岛，完成统一全中国的伟大事业而奋斗！为保卫祖国安全，保卫祖国神圣的领土、领海、领空而奋斗！为保卫东方与世界和平而奋斗！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    亚洲人民大团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
              中国人民解放军总司令  朱德
