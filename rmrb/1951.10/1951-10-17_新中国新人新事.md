    New People and New Things in New China
    Guangxi Agricultural Experiment Station
    Improved Wood-Burning Tractor
    To the Editor:
    After our station launched the democratic reform movement, the ideological understanding of our employees has generally improved. Based on this, we improved the wood-burning tractor. The test drive on September 13 showed that the plowing depth reached 5.5 inches (previously 4.5 inches), which is the same power as a gasoline tractor. The efficiency of the vehicle has been significantly improved, the gas is filtered very cleanly, and the inside of the cylinder is as clean as a gasoline car.

    Model Village for Road Protection: People of Faluling
    Promoting Neighboring Villages to Actively Protect Roads
    To the Editor:
    Faluling, Jingxing County, Hebei Province, is a model village for road protection. The section of the road protected by the people of this village passes through the mountains, and the utility poles are erected on the mountainside. Whenever it rains or snows heavily, the road protection militia are often injured by falling rocks. To get from the village to the railway, one must cross a river, which often floods during the rainy season. One day in July last year, it rained all night, and the river was deep and rapid. The road protection militiaman Li Xiaoer and five others swam to the center of the river, but were pushed more than ten feet by the waves and almost swept away. In order to protect the people's railway, they did not flinch and finally waded through the rapids to inspect the line.
    The village not only completes its road protection tasks, but also promotes other villages to actively protect roads. Cai Village, which neighbors this village, has always been irresponsible in road protection, so this village moved Cai Village with practical actions. The militiamen of this village always detour to Cai Village when inspecting the line every night, summoning the Cai Village militiamen to work and educating them through casual conversations. As a result, the Cai Village militiamen gradually accepted this enlightenment and swept away their previous sluggishness, also becoming a model village for road protection. Wang Ze

    A Girl Who Begged for Food in the Old Society
    Now a Member of the People's Government
    To the Editor:
    There is a well-known female county government member in Mancheng County, Hebei Province - Wang Qingmei, a female labor model from Xiyuhe Village, First District. Wang Qingmei is twenty-two years old this year. The mutual aid team she leads has a total of twelve people, and they operate more than one hundred mu of land for twelve families themselves. They attach great importance to scientific knowledge. Under the promotion of Wang Qingmei and the leadership of her mutual aid team, in 1950, 80% of the farmers in the village carried out seed selection and seed soaking.
    In the democratic construction movement, Wang Qingmei was elected as a member of the county People's Government. She said excitedly: "I suffered since I was a child, went hungry, and begged for food. The Communist Party led me to turn over, and now I am a member of the People's Government."
    Before National Day, she wrote a letter to Chairman Mao. In the letter, she expressed that the mutual aid team she leads is determined to work hard in the autumn harvest and actively hand in public grain, and proposed that after the cotton harvest, in addition to keeping some for their own use, they guarantee to sell all of it to the state or store it in the supply and marketing cooperative.

    A Vacant Lot in Changsha City
    Transformed into a Beautiful Children's Park
    To the Editor:
    The first children's park in Changsha City opened the day after the second National Day. This is a joyous event for the children of Changsha City.
    The children's park is located on Cai E Road in the urban area of ​​Changsha City. It was bombed by enemy planes during the Anti-Japanese War and became a pile of ruins. The People's Government turned that ruin into a children's park. The construction cost of the park was solved by careful calculation. For example, the Labor Bureau sent a relief work team to level the earthwork and carry bricks and tiles; the labor reform team filled the soil and paved the ground; the landscaping team laid turf, built roads, built tracks, and planted flowers and plants. The Young Pioneers of the Second Central Primary School in the east of the city also happily participated in the work of picking up broken bricks in order to build their own park. During the construction period, the nearby residents were very concerned. Someone said, "Chairman Mao is here, and the barren and dirty place has become a beautiful garden!" The park covers an area of ​​thirteen mu, with the original tall grain bark trees, as well as newly built fountains, various flowers and trees, basketball and volleyball courts, various playgrounds, children's reading rooms and other facilities.

    Another Good Harvest After Land Reform
    New Atmosphere in Wugang City
    To the Editor:
    This year, the mid-season rice in central Hunan generally had a bumper harvest. Since the harvest began in September, a new atmosphere has emerged in Wugang City. Before the mid-season rice harvest, the monthly turnover of the native cloth industry was about 180 million yuan, but it increased sharply to 400 million yuan in September. Previously, the most blue calico sold per day was 20 bolts, but now it can sell 100 bolts per day. The sales of large blue cloth have also doubled. Other industries such as dyeing, bamboo weaving, ironwork, local products, and woodwork are also doing better. For example, the bamboo weaving industry alone has increased its turnover by one times compared to last year, just by supplying farmers with harvesting tools.
    What makes the farmers most satisfied is the large-scale purchase of rice by the grain company. In previous years, feudal exploitation tightly bound the farmers. Years of poor harvest were naturally disasters, and even if there was a bumper harvest, it was still a "disaster of a bumper harvest" (because landlords and unscrupulous merchants colluded to lower grain prices during the autumn harvest). This year is different. The market price of rice in Wugang market is only 33,000 to 34,000 yuan per dan due to the excessive supply, but the grain company purchases it in large quantities at a price of 35,000 yuan per dan, so that the farmers do not suffer losses. A farmer named Dai Laoren said after selling the rice to the grain company: "I have lived for fifty-seven years, and this year is really different. The rice sells at a good price, and I can make a new dress to wear this year."

    I Am Fortunate to Live in the Mao Zedong Era
    I am a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis and spinal tuberculosis. For more than a year, I have been constantly fighting against tuberculosis. When I was on the verge of death, I felt sad about my personal future. However, when I thought of the beautiful prospects of the motherland and that I was living in this great era, I felt that my life was valuable. I thought that I was only twenty-seven years old, and I still had abundant vitality and enough time to fight for the liberation of all mankind.
    In early July last year, I returned to my hometown of Kaifeng to recuperate. Because I was in a happy mood, because I had a high degree of confidence in overcoming the disease, and because of other conditions, my completely ulcerated left lung calcified. Later, because I did not pay attention to rest, I contracted spinal tuberculosis again this spring. The doctor said, "Your condition is very dangerous!" When I encountered financial difficulties, my classmates wrote to me saying, "We know that your condition has deteriorated. From this month onwards, we will do our best to help you financially and spiritually."
    Is there anything in the world that can move a dying patient more than this? I was moved to tears. Since then, my classmates have constantly sent money from Beijing, Qingdao, Tianshui, Hengyang, Zhengzhou and other places, so that I can recuperate with peace of mind. My lover sent a letter to them, expressing gratitude for their sincere friendship. But they replied, "Don't thank us, you should thank this great era!" Yes, I should be grateful to this great Mao Zedong era!
    I am studying railway transportation engineering. If my health does not change, I believe that I will recover. The people's railway cause will be my lifelong goal. The Mao Zedong era brought me life, and I want to dedicate my life to the people's cause!
                                    Shen Jiagan
    After Graduating from Normal School, I Will Definitely
    Teach Children Well
    I am a child from a poor peasant family, living in Xiabian Village, Eighth District, Jinxi County, Liaoxi Province. My family only has three mu of thin land. When I was ten years old, I started to do heavy labor. During the spring plowing, I worked as a hired worker for the landlord, planting land and cultivating soil. I was so tired all day long that my legs were numb. Everyone else had finished eating, but I could only eat two bowls of cold rice by myself. In the evening, I slept on a dirt kang without a kang mat. Who could I complain to about this kind of pain at that time? When weeding in the summer, the sun made me dizzy. Because I was young, it was really hard to support myself doing such heavy work, so I couldn't help but squat down to rest. When my uncle saw my poor appearance, he could only sigh, look at me with tears in his eyes, and couldn't say a word.
    Since liberation, my life has changed. I feel that the most precious thing in my life is that I, a child from a poor family, can now study in the normal school class of Jinxi Middle School and live a free and happy life. Sometimes I lower my head and think to myself: I am wearing neat clothes, eating palatable meals, living in a brick house that does not leak, and studying with my classmates every day. I am really unspeakably happy.
    Now the motherland needs me to go to the countryside to educate children. I swear to Chairman Mao that I will resolutely obey the organization's assignment. I will definitely teach children well and will never fail the glorious title of "People's Teacher."

    Repaired the Rugged and Difficult Langya Road
    Our Village's Transportation and Production Have a Solution
    Some time ago, Chairman Mao sent a delegation to visit us, and the delegation inquired in detail about our production and living conditions. What government in Chinese history has ever cared about the common people like this!
    Our village is called Nanyu Village, a small village in Lin County, Pingyuan Province. The east, west, and north sides of the village are mountains, and the south side is a deep ditch, making it very difficult to enter and exit. In the past, there was no large cart in the village, and transportation relied on shoulder carrying or small cart pushing. The best was animal carrying. This consumed a lot of labor and animal power, but the transportation volume was very low. This difficulty has caused our village to lack firewood for burning and lack oil and salt for many years, and urban industrial products are even rarer. For generations, we have been shouldering heavy burdens and always walking on these rugged paths called "Langya Roads." For many years, we have been looking forward to building a flat road!
    In March this year, the People's Government led us to repair the road. When the villagers heard that the road was going to be repaired, everyone was very happy. Men, women, old and young competed to participate. The strange rocks on the "Langya Road" were all destroyed with gunpowder. With the concerted efforts of the entire village, in just ten days, the mountain road that used to hinder us from moving forward was repaired into four flat and wide cart roads. These avenues can lead to Lin County in the north, to the market town in the east and west, and also to the coal kiln. It is truly accessible in all directions, making it convenient to enter and exit.
    Now that the road has been repaired, the situation in our village is very different. Since spring, the whole village has bought ten large carts and more than a dozen mules. Using these mules to pull large carts for transportation is much faster than people carrying or animals carrying in the past. For the first time in history, the farmers in the village are using large carts to transport manure and crops, and have begun to change the backward production methods of people carrying burdens and animals carrying goods that have been passed down from their ancestors, and the productivity has greatly improved. With convenient transportation, we have begun to grow cash crops. In terms of life, almost every household in the village is now burning coal. Last year, the village supply and marketing cooperative supplied us with only more than 60 kinds of goods (including living and production materials), but this year it has increased to 110 kinds. Things that we rarely saw in the mountain valleys in the past, such as various fine cloths, flashlights, rubber shoes, foreign socks, soap, etc., are now available. The benefits of repairing the road are endless, and our happy life has only just begun.
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the farmers in our village have opened up a bright road. In the future, we must follow this road and move forward in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.
                All the Farmers of Nanyu Village, Lin County, Pingyuan Province

    新中国新人新事
    广西农业试验场
    改进木炭拖拉机编辑同志：
    我场展开民主改革运动后，职工的思想认识普遍地提高了一步。在这个基础上，我们改进了木炭拖拉机。经九月十三日试车结果，犁地深度达五吋半（过去四吋半），和汽油拖拉机的力量相同；车子的效率有显著提高，煤气滤得很清，汽缸内部和汽油车一样干净。
                柳州沙溏广西农业试验场护路模范村乏驴岭人民
    推动邻村人民积极护路编辑同志：
    河北省井陉县乏驴岭是一个护路模范村。该村人民负责保护的线路经过山间，电杆立在山腰上；每当阴雨、大雪时，护路民兵常被山石碰伤。由该村至铁道，必须通过一条河，雨季来时，河水常常暴涨。去年七月某日，下了一夜大雨，河水既深且急，护路民兵李小二等六人泅至河心时，被水浪打出丈余，险被冲走。他们为了保护人民的铁路，毫不畏缩，终于涉过急流，负责检查线路。
    该村不但能完成护路任务，而且能推动他村积极护路。与该村为邻的蔡村，在护路时一贯不负责任，该村即以实际行动感动蔡村。该村民兵每夜检查线路时总要绕至蔡村，召唤该村民兵上班，并以闲谈的方式进行教育。结果，蔡村民兵逐渐接受了这种启发，一扫以前疲塌的现象，也变成了护路模范村。  王  则在旧社会里讨饭的女孩子
    现在当上了人民政府委员编辑同志：
    河北省满城县有一位全县知名的县政府女委员——一区西渝河村妇女劳动模范王青梅。王青梅今年二十二岁，她领导的互助组共十二个人，十二家的一百多亩地，都由她们自己操作。她们十分重视科学知识。在王青梅的宣传和她的互助组的带动下，一九五○年，全村百分之八十的农民进行了选种和浸种。
    在民主建政运动中，王青梅当选了县人民政府的委员。她激动地说：“我自小受苦，挨过饿，讨过饭，共产党领导我翻了身，现在我又当上人民政府委员了。”
    国庆节前夕，她曾给毛主席写了一封信。信中表示她领导的互助组决心努力秋收，踊跃缴公粮，并提出：棉花收成后，除自己留用一些外，保证全部卖给国家或存到供销社。  犁  生长沙市的一块瓦砾场
    变成美丽的儿童公园编辑同志：
    第二届国庆节后一日，长沙市第一个儿童公园开幕了。这是长沙市儿童的一件喜事。
    儿童公园位于长沙市区的蔡锷路。那里在抗战时期曾遭敌机轰炸，成为一堆废墟；人民政府把那一块废墟，修建成一所儿童公园。公园的修建费用是用精打细算的办法解决的，如劳动局派赈工队平土方，挑砖瓦；劳动改造队填土，铺地面；园林队铺草皮，做路面，筑跑道，栽植花草。城东第二中心小学的少年儿童队，为了建设自己的公园，也兴高采烈地参加拾碎砖的工作。在修建期间，附近的居民都很关心，有人说：“毛主席来了，过去荒芜肮脏的地方变成美丽的花园了！”公园占地十三亩，内有原有的高大的谷皮树，还有新设的喷水池，各种花木，篮、排球场，各种游戏场、儿童阅览室等设备。
                                    赖康宁土地改革以后又获丰收
    武冈城里出现了新气象编辑同志：
    今年湖南中部的中稻普庆丰收。从九月份开始收割以来，武冈城里的生意就出现了新的气象。在中稻收割以前，土布业每月的营业额约在一亿八千万元左右，九月份骤增至四亿元；以前青洋布每天最多卖二十匹，现在每天可以卖一百匹；大蓝布也多销了一倍。其他如漂染、竹篾、铁作、土产、木器等行业，生意也好起来了。像竹篾业，光供应农民收割的用具一项，就比去年增加了一倍的营业额。
    最使农民们满意的，是粮食公司的大量收购稻谷。在往年，封建剥削紧紧缚住了农民，歉收的年岁固然是灾荒，即使碰到一个丰收，也还是“丰收成灾”（因为秋收时地主和奸商勾结，压低粮价）。今年不同了，武冈市场上的稻谷，因来货太旺，每担市价只有三万三、四千元，但粮食公司以三万五千元一担的价格大量购进，不使农民吃亏。有个农民名叫戴老仁，把谷子卖给粮食公司后，他说：“我活了五十七岁，今年硬是不同了。谷子卖得起价，今年可做件新衣穿。”
                湖南武冈城关区政府  董志锷我庆幸能生活在毛泽东时代
    我是一个肺结核和脊椎结核患者。一年多来，我和结核病不断作斗争。我在频于死的边缘时，曾感到个人前途的悲哀。但是，我想到祖国美丽的远景，和我生存在这伟大的时代，我便感觉到我的生命是可贵的。我想到我还只有二十七岁，我还有充沛的生命力和足够的时间，来为全人类的解放事业而奋斗。
    去年七月初，我回到故乡开封休养。由于我的心情是愉快的，由于我对战胜疾病具有高度的信心，加上其他条件，我那全部溃烂的左肺钙化了。后来，我因为没有注意休息，今年春天，又感染了脊椎结核。医生说：“你的病很危险！”当我在经济上发生困难的时候，同学们来信说：“我们知道你的病况恶化了。从这个月起，我们每个人要在经济上、精神上尽力帮助你。”
    世界上还有比这更能使一个垂死的病人感动的吗？我激动地淌下了热泪。从此，同学们不断地从北京、青岛、天水、衡阳、郑州等地寄来钱，让我能安心地休养。我的爱人寄信给他们，对他们的真挚的友谊表示感激。但他们回信说：“不要感谢我们，应该感谢这伟大的时代！”是的，我应该感激这伟大的毛泽东时代！
    我是学铁道运输工程的。假若我的健康没有变化，我相信我是会康复的。人民的铁道事业将是我终身奋斗的目标。毛泽东时代给我带来了生命，我要把我的生命献给人民的事业！
                                    申嘉淦我在师范班毕业后，一定
    要教好儿童
    我是一个贫农家的孩子，住在辽西省锦西县第八区下边村，家里只有三亩薄田。十岁的时候，我就开始操作繁重的劳动。在春耕时，我给地主家当雇工，种地、培土。我一天到晚累得两腿发麻。人家都吃完饭啦，我只能独自吃两碗冷饭；到晚间，睡在没有炕席的土炕上。这种苦痛，在那时向谁诉说呢？在夏锄的时候，太阳晒得我发蒙。因为我年纪小，做这样重的活计，实在有些支持不住，就禁不住蹲下休息。我叔叔看见我这付可怜的样子，也只有叹口气，含着泪看着我，不能说出一句话来。
    自从解放以后，我的生活随着改变了。我感觉，我这一生最难得的事情是：我这贫穷人家的孩子，今天竟能到锦西中学师范班学习，过着自由幸福的生活。我有时低下头想想自己：穿的是整洁的衣服，吃的是适口的菜饭，住的是滴水不漏的砖房，每天和同学在一起学习，我真有说不出的高兴。
    现在祖国需要我到农村去教育儿童，我向毛主席宣誓，我坚决服从组织分配，我一定教好儿童，决不辜负“人民教师”的光荣称号。
                    锦西中学分校师模班  熊梦海修好了崎岖难行的狼牙路
    我村的交通和生产有了办法
    前些日子毛主席派访问团来慰问我们，访问团详详细细地询问了我们的生产和生活情况。我们中国历史上那有过这样关心老百姓的政府啊！
    我们村叫南峪村，是平原省林县的一个小村子，村的东、西、北三面有山，南面是一条深沟，进出道路非常困难。过去村里没有一辆大车，运输都靠肩挑，或小车推，顶好的是牲口驮。这样耗费了大批的劳力和畜力，但运量却很低。这种困难，造成俺村长年缺柴烧，缺油盐，城市工业品就更少见了。我们世世代代，肩不离重担，总是走着这些叫作“狼牙路”的崎岖小路，我们多少年来就想望着修一条平路呵！
    今年三月，人民政府领导我们修好了路。村里人一听到要修路，个个都很欢喜。男女老幼争着参加。把“狼牙路”上的怪石都用火药炸毁了。在全村群众一致努力下，旬日间，把旧日阻碍我们迈步的山路，修成了四条平坦坦的大车道。这些大道北可通林县城里，东西可以到集镇，也可以到煤窑上去。真是四通八达，出入方便。
    现在修好了路，我们村的情景就大不同了。全村从春天到现在，买了十辆大车，十几条骡子；用这些骡拉大车，搞起运输，比以前人挑、牲口驮快多了。村里农民们有史以来第一次赶上大车送粪，运庄稼，开始改变了祖辈流传的人挑担，牲口驮的落后生产方式，生产力大大提高了一步。交通方便了，我们开始种植了经济作物。从生活方面来说，现在全村差不多家家户户都烧上煤了。去年村供销社供给我们只有六十几种货物（包括生活和生产资料），今年就增加到一百一十种。我们过去在山沟里很少见的东西，像各种细布、手电筒、胶皮鞋、洋袜子、香皂等等，现在都有了。修路的好处是说不完的，我们的幸福生活才是开始。
    在毛主席领导下，我们村的农民开辟了光明大道，今后我们一定要沿着这条路，朝着毛主席指引我们的方向走下去。
