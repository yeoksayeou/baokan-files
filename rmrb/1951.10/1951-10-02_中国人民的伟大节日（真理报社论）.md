    The Great Festival of the Chinese People
    (Pravda Editorial)
    The Chinese people are welcoming their festival – October 1st, the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China – in an atmosphere of great political and labor upsurge.
    Bound by the ties of inviolable and eternal friendship, the Soviet people share the joy of the Chinese people. The working people of the people's democratic countries and all progressive mankind also celebrate this significant day with the Chinese people.
    The Chinese people will welcome with satisfaction Comrade Stalin's historically significant congratulatory message to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.
    Comrade Stalin's message reads: "On the second anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Chairman, please accept my friendly congratulations. I sincerely hope that the great Chinese people, the government of the People's Republic of China, and you personally will achieve further successes in the construction of a people's democratic China.
    May the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics – a strong guarantee of peace and security in the Far East – be forever consolidated."
    The People's Republic of China has only been established for two years, but the liberated Chinese people have traveled such a great road! The historic victory of the Chinese revolution has had such astonishing results for the fate of the Chinese people and for the development of international relations worldwide!
    The historic victory was achieved because of the defeat of German fascism and Japanese imperialism, in which the Soviet Union played a decisive role. Since the Great October Socialist Revolution, the victory of the Chinese people has been the most powerful blow to the entire imperialist system.
    The liberated, independent, and people's democratic China has firmly stood in the glorious position of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and China has created a powerful force for consolidating peace, unparalleled in human history.
    In the past two years, the People's Republic of China has embarked on the road of fundamental reform and has achieved great successes in all aspects of life – political, economic, and cultural. For the first time in its history, China has pursued an independent foreign policy, a policy filled with the spirit of supreme loyalty to peace and strictly adhering to the truly democratic principles of international cooperation.
    The victorious development of sincere friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and the establishment of mutually beneficial commercial relations with many other countries, have consolidated the international position of the People's Republic of China, increased its prestige among peace-loving countries, and increased its influence on the development of international relations.
    The Chinese people have consistently upheld the cause of peace and are striving to consolidate security in the Far East. The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting side by side with the Korean people against the United States and other aggressors, have won indelible glory and have won the ardent love of all progressive mankind.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its long-tested leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have unified the entire mainland of China, including Tibet, within the People's Republic of China. Now, the only remaining territory to be liberated is the Chinese island of Taiwan and some other coastal islands, which have always belonged to China but are now occupied by the American imperialists.
    China's economy has greatly developed and is embarking on the broad road of steady development and prosperity. Relying on the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and expanding and strengthening their economic ties with the various people's democratic countries, the Chinese people have achieved significant successes in restoring and developing their industry. From January to August of this year, pig iron production was 11.4 times that of the same period in 1949, and steel was 7.8 times that of 1949. The production of state-owned mines is exceeding the plan. Electricity production in 1950 increased by almost 15 percent compared to 1949. The production of the textile industry is also steadily increasing. Railways and transportation are being restored and expanded very rapidly.
    The victorious implementation of the land reform is a truly historic event for the People's Republic of China, which has eliminated feudal relations in the countryside. Now, in areas with a population of over 300 million, land has been transferred to peasant ownership. The nationwide land reform is scheduled to be largely completed in 1952. The rapid recovery of agriculture and the significant increase in agricultural productivity show that the land reform has had a beneficial impact.
    Cultural undertakings are developing on a large scale throughout the country. The victory of the Chinese revolution has given the masses of the people the opportunity to receive education and has allowed the rich creativity of the people's talents to develop freely. According to Chinese newspapers, China now has 37 million primary school students, 1.5 million middle school students, and 140,000 university students. The most significant feature is the rapid increase in the number of children of workers and peasants attending school. Schools for workers and peasants to study in their spare time have been widely established. In April of this year, 1.5 million workers were studying in these schools; in the last quarter of 1950, 25 million peasants participated in winter schools.
    Significant successes have been achieved in literature and art. Publishing is developing on a large scale. Last year, the total number of copies of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin published in China exceeded 2.27 million.
    The Communist Party of China has mobilized the creative power of millions of people to engage in peaceful construction and to build a new and free life.
    The victory of the Chinese people has angered the imperialist reactionary camp. Aggressive American imperialism is trying to obstruct the construction of the new China and is intensifying its conspiracies against the Far East. The separate peace treaty with Japan signed in San Francisco has eloquently confirmed this conspiracy, the purpose of which is to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a hotbed for imperialism to carry out aggression against the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries. However, the evil conspiracies of the American and British imperialists will inevitably be thwarted. The peoples of Asia resolutely oppose the separate peace treaty with Japan signed in San Francisco and regard it as a treaty preparing for another war.
    The People's Republic of China has entered its third year of establishment. The strong, powerful, free, and independent Chinese people, closely united around their Communist Party and their leader Mao Zedong, are confidently advancing towards the further victory of building a free life and defending the great cause of peace.
    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet people extend their heartfelt fraternal congratulations to the Chinese people.
    Long live the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union!

    中国人民的伟大节日
    （真理报社论）
    中国人民在伟大的政治与劳动高涨的气氛中迎接他们的节日——十月一日，中华人民共和国宣告成立的日子。
    苏联人民由不可侵犯的永久友谊的纽带和中国人民连在一起，他们与中国人民同感欢乐。人民民主国家的劳动人民和全体进步人类也都与中国人民一道庆祝这个意义重大的日子。
    中国人民将怀着满意的心情欢迎斯大林同志在致中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志的电报中具有历史意义的贺词。
    斯大林同志的电文说：“在中华人民共和国成立二周年纪念日，主席同志，请接受我友谊的祝贺。衷心地希望伟大的中国人民、中华人民共和国政府及您本人在人民民主中国的建设中获得进一步的成就。
    让中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的伟大友谊——远东和平及安全的坚强保障永远巩固。”
    中华人民共和国成立刚刚两年，但是解放了的中国人民却经历了多么伟大的道路啊！中国革命的历史性胜利，对于中国人民的命运、对于全世界国际关系的发展来说，是多么惊人的结果啊！
    中国人民历史性的胜利所以能够获得，是由于德国法西斯和日本帝国主义被击败，在这一事件上，苏联曾起了决定性的作用。自伟大的十月社会主义革命以来，中国人民的胜利是对整个帝国主义制度的最强有力的打击。
    解放了的独立的人民民主中国，已经坚定地站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中的光荣位置上。苏中友好同盟互助条约的缔结产生了人类历史上无可比拟的巩固和平的强大力量。
    中华人民共和国在过去两年中走上了根本改革的道路，在生活的各个方面——政治、经济、文化方面——都获得了巨大的成就。中国在它的历史上第一次奉行着独立的外交政策，这个政策充满着对于和平的至高无上的忠诚的精神，严格地遵守着国际合作的真正民主原则。
    与苏联和人民民主国家真诚的友好关系的胜利发展，与许多其他国家建立互惠的商业关系，已经巩固了中华人民共和国的国际地位，增加了它在爱好和平的国家中的威望，并且也增加了它在国际关系的发展上的影响。
    中国人民一贯地维护和平事业，并且正在为巩固远东的安全而奋斗。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民并肩及美国和其他侵略者作战，已经获得了不可磨灭的光荣，并赢得了整个进步人类的热诚的爱戴。
    中国人民在中国共产党及其久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，已经把包括西藏在内的整个中国大陆统一在中华人民共和国之中。现在，尚待解放的只有历来就属于中国而现在被美帝国主义者占领的中国台湾岛及其他一些沿海的岛屿。
    中国的经济已大大发展，走上了稳步发展与繁荣的康庄大道。中国人民依靠着苏联兄弟般的无私的援助，并且扩大与加强他们与各人民民主国家的经济联系，因此，在恢复与发展自己的工业方面已获得了重大的成就。在今年一月到八月间，生铁生产为一九四九年同期的十一点四倍，钢为七点八倍。国营矿业的生产正在超过计划。一九五○年电力的生产几乎比一九四九年增加了百分之十五。纺织业的生产也在稳步增加。铁路、运输正在非常迅速地恢复和扩展着。
    胜利地实行的土地改革，对中华人民共和国是具有真正历史意义的大事，它使农村中的封建关系得以消灭。现在，在三亿多人口的地区，土地已经转为农民所有。全国范围的土地改革预定在一九五二年大体完成。从农业的迅速恢复与农业生产力的大大增加，可以看出土地改革已发生了有利的影响。
    文化事业正在全国大规模地发展着。中国革命的胜利使人民群众有机会受教育，并且使人民天赋的丰富的创造力得到自由的发展。据中国报纸报道，中国现在有三千七百万小学生，一百五十万中学生，十四万高等学校学生。最大的特点是工农子弟上学的人数迅速增加。已普遍设立工农在业余时间进行学习的学校。今年四月，有一百五十万工人在这种学校学习；在一九五○年最后一季中，有二千五百万农民参加冬学。
    文学与艺术方面已经取得了重大的成功。出版事业正在大规模发展着，去年中国出版的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，其总数超过了二百二十七万册。
    中国共产党动员了数以百万计的人民的创造力量，从事和平的建设性劳动，从事建设新的自由生活。
    中国人民的胜利激怒了帝国主义反动阵营。侵略性的美帝国主义竭力想阻挠新中国的建设，而且加紧它对远东的阴谋。在旧金山签订的单独对日和约已雄辩地证实了这种阴谋，这个单独对日和约的目的是恢复日本军国主义并把日本变成帝国主义对中华人民共和国、苏联以及其他爱好和平的国家进行侵略的温床。但是，美英帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋必将遭到挫败。亚洲各国人民坚决反对在旧金山签订的单独对日和约，并且把它认为是准备另一次战争的条约。
    中华人民共和国已进入它成立的第三年。强盛、壮大、自由和独立的中国人民，紧密地团结在他们的共产党及其领袖毛泽东的周围，并且充满信心地向建设自由生活、向保卫伟大和平事业的进一步胜利前进。
    值此中华人民共和国建国两周年的纪念日，苏联人民谨向中国人民致以衷心的兄弟般的祝贺。
    中华人民共和国与苏联的伟大友谊万岁！
