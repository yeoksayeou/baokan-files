The various local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party are actively preparing to lead Party members and the masses in studying and promoting "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in a planned manner upon learning of its forthcoming publication.

    North China

    The North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued an instruction on the 12th of this month, requesting local Party committees to conscientiously organize the promotion of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The instruction pointed out: The publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is a major event in the political life of the entire Party and the people of the country. This is because Chairman Mao's important works in various periods of the Chinese revolution have most correctly and profoundly applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism, creating the most complete theory and policy regarding the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao's works have not only been proven by millions of practices to be the only correct guide for leading the Chinese people to defeat various enemies and achieve great victories, but also the greatest guarantee for consolidating and developing the people's revolutionary cause and building a new China in the future. Therefore, local Party committees must very conscientiously organize the promotion of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." In addition to promoting newspapers, periodicals, and radio stations to publish commentaries explaining the great significance of the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," they should also systematically organize readers who have obtained the "Selected Works" to express their thoughts and opinions. Local Party committees should also successively organize cadres, Party members, and the masses, especially responsible cadres of provincial, district, and municipal Party committees, to write articles, study notes, reading notes, and other texts for newspapers and periodicals, elucidating Mao Zedong Thought in combination with the current ideological situation inside and outside the Party. The instruction also pointed out: In order to earnestly help cadres study Chairman Mao's works, the North China Bureau plans to launch a movement to study Party history and Chairman Mao's works among cadres and Party members throughout the region next year. The North China Bureau called on all regions to enthusiastically prepare for next year's study movement.

    Northeast

    In order to make all Party cadres and members aware of the great political significance of publishing "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and to mobilize cadres to study and promote this document, the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued two instructions on September 29th and October 11th, respectively. These two instructions pointed out: "The publication of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' marks the great victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in China." "The publication of this great document is an event of extremely great significance on the theoretical and ideological front of the Party, and an important event in the cause of Marxism-Leninism." The instructions stipulated: In order to deeply promote Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, all localities should, from the date of the distribution of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," organize Party members and cadres to publish articles (such as research papers, study心得, etc.), combined with the current ideological situation of cadres and the masses and the actual work situation, to promote the great political significance of the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as introduce past experiences, methods, and lessons learned from studying Mao Zedong Thought. Regarding the issue of organizing cadres to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," the Northeast Bureau instructed: "First, at the Northeast-level organs (including the departments and commissions of the Northeast Bureau, and the departments and bureaus of the Northeast People's Government) and at the provincial and municipal-level Party and government organs, under guided conditions, organize one or several study groups, with the main responsible comrades of each department serving as the group leader. At the same time, preparations should be started now regarding the plan for formally studying 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' next year, and this plan should be included in the 1952 theoretical study plan."

    East China

    The East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee instructed all its subordinate Party committees at the beginning of this month: After the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," cadres should be conscientiously organized to study and publish promotional articles in newspapers; at the same time, a special committee has also been organized to lead this work in a planned and organized manner.

    In order to welcome the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and do a good job in various preparatory work before publication, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held discussions at the Standing Committee meeting of the Municipal Committee on the 6th of this month. At the meeting, Comrade Liu Changsheng, the third secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP, emphasized that the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is a major event in the political life of our Party and the people of the country. After publication, all Party members in the city, especially Party member cadres, should conduct prepared and planned studies under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP has included the preparatory work for leading cadres throughout the city to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in the plan for the fourth quarter of this year. Comrade Xia Yan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, and Comrade Yao Qin, Deputy Minister, also emphasized the importance of the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" at the meeting of propaganda cadres throughout the city, and requested Party committees at all levels throughout the city to lead Xinhua Bookstore to do a good job in distribution. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP also decided to convene an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee again after the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to specifically discuss detailed plans for promoting and studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

    In order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Party and to cooperate with the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CCP has renovated three places of great importance to Party history as revolutionary historical memorial halls: the address where the Party held its founding congress in Shanghai, the address of the first underground central headquarters in Shanghai after the Party's founding, and the dormitories of Chairman Mao and other representatives when they held the founding congress. The memorial halls are being rushed to completion and will be opened soon.
