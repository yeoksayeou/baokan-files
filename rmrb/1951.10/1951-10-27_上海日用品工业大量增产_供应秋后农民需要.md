Shanghai Daily Necessities Industry Massively Increases Production
Supplying Farmers' Needs After the Autumn Harvest

To supply the livelihood needs of the vast number of farmers after the autumn harvest, Shanghai's daily necessities industry is massively increasing production. The East China Branch of the State-owned Department Store Company, in preparation for autumn supply, has already made purchases during this summer that account for 70% of the total purchases of last summer, autumn, and winter combined. The procurement plan for the second half of this year has also increased nearly twofold compared to the first half. By mid-August, the East China Branch had signed orders or exclusive sales contracts with 319 manufacturers in Shanghai, guiding and assisting Shanghai's daily necessities industry in further expanding production. The match industry, which had once shrunk in production due to product stagnation last year, has seen its output in the first half of this year increase by 37% compared to the same period last year. The production figures for August and September have greatly exceeded the level of the first half of the year. Soap is the first fast-selling product to appear before the autumn harvest. The private soap and candle industry's soap production in the first half of the year increased by 73% compared to the peak season last year. The output in August and September even exceeded the highest record since the War of Resistance Against Japan. The cigarette output in September exceeded that of May by 76%. The increase in the production of thermos bottles is particularly significant. According to a survey in Xishanli Village, Taihu Lake, almost every one of the more than 200 households in the village has a bamboo-shell thermos bottle. Due to the universal demand from farmers, Shanghai's bamboo-shell thermos bottle production reached more than 5,900 dozens in July, more than double the amount in March. Shanghai's flashlight industry is also massively increasing production to meet the bulk purchasing requirements of cooperatives across the country. The production of other items such as enamelware, pens, and paper is also being actively expanded.

In the process of massively increasing production for the rural areas, Shanghai's daily necessities industry has overcome some difficulties in the supply of raw materials. For example, the thermos bottle industry used to rely on imported raw materials to produce iron-shell thermos bottles, which faced difficulties after liberation. In February of this year, under the guidance of state-owned enterprises, the industry manufactured bamboo-shell thermos bottles to replace iron-shell ones, which overcame the raw material difficulties and reduced costs by more than four-fifths. Recently, they also created a new type of lacquered bamboo tube shell, which is both beautiful and not easily damaged, and is widely welcomed by farmers, further expanding sales. The flashlight industry used to be restricted in production due to the difficulty in obtaining copper materials. Recently, some factories have created a paper-fiber tube to replace the copper shell. If the city produces 1,000 dozens of flashlights per day, it can save more than 1,200 catties of copper per day. Moreover, the manufacturing process is simplified, and the product cost is reduced accordingly. In addition, the soap industry using hardened oil to replace tallow, and the leather industry using pigskin to replace cowhide, have also partially alleviated the difficulties in obtaining raw materials for these industries.

    上海日用品工业大量增产
    供应秋后农民需要
    为供应秋后广大农民的生活需要，上海市日用品工业正大量增加生产。国营百货公司华东区公司为准备秋后供应，今年夏季的采购额已占到去年夏、秋、冬三季总采购额的百分之七十，今年下半年的进货计划又较上半年增加了近两倍。到八月中旬为止，华东区公司已与上海三百一十九家厂商签订了定货或包销合同，指导和扶助上海日用品工业进一步扩大生产。去年因产品滞销生产一度萎缩的火柴工业，今年上半年的产量已较去年同期增加百分之三十七，八，九两月的生产数字又大大超过上半年的水平。肥皂是今年秋收到临前最先出现的旺销产品。私营皂烛工业上半年的肥皂产量即比去年旺季增加百分之七十三，八、九两月份的产量更超过了抗日战争以来的最高纪录。九月份的卷烟产量超过五月份百分之七十六。热水瓶工业的增产尤为显著。据太湖西山西里村的调查，全村二百多户人家，差不多家家有一只竹壳热水瓶。在农民的普遍需求下，上海竹壳热水瓶七月份产量达到五千九百余打，较三月份提高了一倍以上。上海的手电筒工业也正大量增产，以满足全国各地合作社的批购要求。其他如搪瓷、钢笔、纸张等的生产，也都在积极扩大。
    上海市日用品工业在面向农村大量增产的过程中，曾克服了若干原料供应上的困难。如热水瓶工业，过去依赖国外进口原料生产铁壳水瓶，解放后
    一度遭受困难。今年二月，该业在国营企业指导下，制造以竹壳代替铁壳的热水瓶，结果克服了原料困难，成本也减低五分之四以上。最近他们又创制一种喷漆竹筒壳，既美观又不易损坏，受到农民的普遍欢迎，销路更加扩大。手电筒工业过去因为铜料来源困难，生产曾受到限制。最近部分工厂已创制一种纸柏管代替铜壳。如以全市日产一千打手电筒计，每日即可节约用铜一千二百余斤；且制造手续简化，产品成本随之减低。此外如肥皂工业利用硬化油脂代替柏油，制革工业利用猪皮代替牛皮，也都部分地减轻了这些工业原料来源的困难。
