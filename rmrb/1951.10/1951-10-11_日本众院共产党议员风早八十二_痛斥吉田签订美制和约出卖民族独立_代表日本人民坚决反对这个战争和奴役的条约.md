Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese House of Representatives Communist member, Hayakawa Yasoji, questioned the government on the draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty on August 17th. The following is a summary of the questioning:

　　Six years ago, when the Japanese government signed the surrender document on the battleship "Missouri," the people of the whole country vowed to never let the war of aggression rise again. But where in this draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty can we see the guarantee that we will no longer wage war? What we can see here is, in fact, a declaration of war against the Soviet Union and China. Where can we see the guarantee of national independence here? What we see here is an enslaved country. Where is the reconciliation in this treaty? Isn't this precisely the colonization of Japan?

　　Secondly, this draft peace treaty does not guarantee the independence of the Japanese nation. It makes Japan a vassal state. The final draft adds a clause on Japanese sovereignty to deceive the Japanese people. But this clause on Japanese sovereignty is merely an empty formality, because the "Security Treaty," signed at the same time as the peace treaty, allows American troops to remain in Japan indefinitely. This military treaty recognizes the right of American troops to remain in Japan indefinitely, establish two hundred military bases in Japan, travel freely throughout Japan, use public facilities at will, and use Japanese people to serve in their armies. Furthermore, Japanese prosecuting authorities cannot interfere in any crimes that may be committed by American troops stationed in Japan. This is more shameful than the notorious U.S.-Philippines military treaty of 1947.

　　The indefinite stationing of American troops and the extraterritorial rights of the United States—these two things alone are enough to show that this treaty is an unprecedentedly shameful treaty. This treaty clearly violates the Potsdam Proclamation. The angry feelings of the people of Amami Oshima against being placed under American trusteeship clearly demonstrate the deep indignation of the entire Japanese people against this treaty. But Prime Minister Yoshida, disregarding the anger of the Japanese people, unhesitatingly sold out national independence and personally went to San Francisco to sign this treaty. What reason do we have to sign this shameless draft treaty? I raise this question to Prime Minister Yoshida based on the honor and pride of the Japanese nation.

　　Again, this treaty does not guarantee the democratic rights and stable life of the Japanese people. While freedom of the press, freedom of publication, especially freedom of assembly and freedom to express peaceful wishes are suppressed, ideas, publications, films, and newspapers that incite war and cultivate militarism are greatly encouraged. In addition to planning harmful revisions to the three basic labor laws, the government is also preparing the "Public Security Preservation Law" of militarist Japan of the past. While the democratic rights of the people are being destroyed, the economic situation of the people is declining to an unbearable level. There are now more than ten million unemployed and semi-unemployed workers, and the government is still considering laying off a portion of the total of 740,000 employees in national railways, telecommunications bureaus, post offices, and other government agencies. The democratic rights and the lives of the Japanese people, clearly stipulated in the Potsdam Proclamation, are thus ignored and trampled upon.

　　The conclusion of the military treaty will increase the already heavy burden on the Japanese people. American troops and affiliated personnel are exempt from taxes. Surprisingly, the U.S. government will only bear half of the cost of stationing troops in Japan. It is clear from our calculations that Japan will bear more than 200 billion yen, which is twice the amount of occupation fees paid by the Japanese government in this year alone. In addition, 200,000 Japanese troops will be organized as assistants to the American troops stationed in Japan. The cost of this army alone will reach 500 billion yen. All this staggering expenditure for military purposes will be borne by the Japanese people. In order to suppress the people who resist this intolerable burden, the former secret police are being restored with the Special Examination Bureau as the center. This treaty has brought a life of slavery to the Japanese people.

　　Prime Minister Yoshida touts this treaty—a treaty that will enslave the Japanese people and make them unable to make a living—as an "unprecedentedly generous treaty." It is true that this treaty states that Japan is unable to pay reparations, but the true intention of the United States is to monopolize Japan and not distribute reparations to the former belligerent countries. This is the reason why the United States made such a provision in this treaty. Not only has Japan paid 500 billion yen to the occupying forces as occupation fees to date, but our entire country and people are now being offered as reparations to the United States alone. This means that the Japanese people are offering their flesh and blood and the money they have gathered in a year at the expense of their ordinary lives to the plan of re-militarization based on the aggressive policy of the United States. Does Prime Minister Yoshida still call this cruel and ruthless treaty a generous treaty to deceive the people and intend to shamelessly sign this treaty?

　　If Prime Minister Yoshida were Japanese, he should be ashamed to death now.

　　The peace-loving Japanese people and the people of the world insist on opposing this treaty made by the United States. In Japan, six million organized Japanese workers, including the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, unanimously oppose this treaty, and they are now determined to tear up this treaty by means of strikes. In the Philippines, the portrait of Mr. Dulles, who drafted this treaty, was burned. The day when this treaty itself will be burned by peace-loving people all over the world is coming soon. This draft treaty is actually bankrupt. The San Francisco conference itself was a failure.

　　Our party, representing the voices of the Japanese and world's peace-loving people, declares that the signing of this treaty is illegal and unreasonable. Even with Prime Minister Yoshida's signature, this treaty is doomed to fail. The Japanese people will cancel this treaty with their own hands. Yoshida has lost all national sentiment and patriotism (if he had any national sentiment and patriotism, he would have rejected this treaty), and he can no longer call himself a representative of the Japanese people. In the name of the peace-loving Japanese people, we demand Prime Minister Yoshida's resignation.

    日本众院共产党议员风早八十二
    痛斥吉田签订美制和约出卖民族独立
    代表日本人民坚决反对这个战争和奴役的条约
    【新华社讯】东京迟到消息：日本众院共产党议员风早八十二在八月十七日就对日和约草案和日美《安全条约》向政府提出质询。质询摘要如下：
    六年以前，当日本政府在“密苏里”号军舰上在投降书上签字的时候，全国人民都痛切发誓不让侵略战争再起。但是我们能够在这个对日和约草案中什么地方看到使我们不再进行战争的保证呢？我们在这里能够看到的是事实上向苏联和中国宣战。我们能够在这里看到什么民族独立的保证呢？我们在这里看到一个受奴役的国家。这个条约中有什么和解呢？这不正是使日本殖民地化吗？
    其次，这个和约草案没有保证日本民族的独立。它使日本沦为附属国。最后确定的草案加上一个关于日本主权的条款，以欺骗日本人民。但是这个关于日本主权的条款只是空洞的具文，因为和签订和约同时签订的“安全条约”，准许美国军队无限期地留驻日本。这个军事条约承认美国军队有权无限期地留驻日本，在日本建立二百个军事基地，在日本各地自由旅行，随意使用公用设备，并利用日本人替他们服军役。还有一点，日本检察当局不能干预留驻日本的美军可能犯的任何罪行。这比一九四七年的臭名远扬的美菲军事条约更加丢人。
    美国军队的无限期地留驻和美国的治外法权——单这两样就足够说明这个和约是史无前例的可耻的和约。这个和约显然违反了波茨坦公告。奄美大岛人民反对受美国托管的愤怒情绪，清楚地表现了全体日本人民对这个条约的深切愤慨。但是吉田首相不顾日本人民的愤怒，毫不迟疑地出卖民族独立，亲自到旧金山去在这个和约上签字。我们有什么理由在这个无耻的和约草案上签字呢？我凭日本民族的荣誉和骄傲向吉田首相提出这个问题。
    再次，这个条约没有保障日本人民的民主权利和稳定生活。在新闻自由、出版自由、特别是集会自由和表示和平愿望的自由横遭压制的情况下，显示煽动战争和培植军国主义的思想、出版物、影片和报纸大受鼓励。政府除了筹划对三项基本的劳动法进行有害的修改以外，还正在准备过去的军国主义日本的“治安保障法”。和人民的民主权利受到摧残的同时，人民的经济状况正在下降到难以忍受的水平。现在失业和半失业的工人有一千万以上，而政府还在考虑解雇国营铁路、电信局和邮局以及其他政府机关里的总数达七十四万的工作人员的一部分。波茨坦公告中明白规定的日本人民的民主权利和人民的生活，就这样被忽视和践踏了。
    军事条约的缔结，将增加日本人民身上原已沉重的负担。美国军队和附属人员免缴赋税。令人惊讶的是美国政府仅将担负在日本驻扎的军队的费用的一半。从我们的计算里可以清楚地看出，日本将负担两千亿日元以上，这个数目两倍于日本政府在今年一年中支付的占领费。除此以外，二十万日本军队将被组编起来，作为驻在日本的美国军队的助手。单是这支军队的费用就要达到五千亿日元。这一切用于军事方面的惊人费用，将由日本人民负担。为了镇压反抗这种不可忍耐的负担的人民，以前的秘密警察正在以特别审查局为中心恢复起来。这个和约给日本人民带来了奴隶般的生活。
    吉田首相把这个条约——将使日本人民沦为奴隶并使他们无以为生的条约——捧为“空前宽大的条约”。诚然，这个条约说日本无力赔偿，但是美国的真正用意是独占日本，而不把赔款分给以前的交战国，这就是美国之所以在这个条约中作这样的规定的原因。不但日本到现在为止已付给占领军五千亿日元作为占领费，而且我们整个国家和人民现在正被当作赔偿物品献给美国一个国家。这就是说日本人民正在把他们的血肉之躯和他们在牺牲自己的普通生活的情况下在一年当中聚集到的金钱，献给根据美国侵略政策而实行的重行军国主义化的计划。难道吉田首相还把这个冷酷残忍的条约称做宽大的条约，以欺骗人民，并打算无耻地在这个条约上签字吗？
    如果吉田首相是日本人的话，他现在应当羞愧死了。
    爱好和平的日本人民和全世界人民坚持反对美国制造的这个条约。在日本，六百万有组织的日本劳工，包括日本工会总评议会在内，一致反对这个条约，他们现在决心用罢工方式撕毁这个条约。在菲律宾，草拟这个和约的杜勒斯先生的肖像被人烧毁。这个条约本身被全世界爱好和平的人民烧毁的日子快要到了。这个和约草案实际上已经破产。旧金山会议本身就是一个失败。
    我党代表日本和全世界爱好和平的人民的呼声，宣布这个和约的签订是非法而无理的。这个条约虽然有吉田首相的签字，也是注定要失败的。日本人民将用自己的手取消这个条约。吉田已丧尽民族感情和爱国心（如果他有一点民族感情和爱国心的话，他是会拒绝这个和约的），他已不能再自称为日本人的代表了。我们以爱好和平的日本人民的名义，要求吉田首相辞职。
