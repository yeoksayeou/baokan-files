    The Japanese People Oppose the Ratification of the Separate Treaty
    On September 15th, the Japanese Peace Protection Committee issued a statement calling on the Japanese people to launch a protest movement against the ratification of the American-made separate treaty and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and to initiate a "Peace Month Against the Ratification of the Separate Treaty" starting from September 20th. This call from the Japanese Peace Protection Committee has been warmly received by the Japanese people; Japanese labor unions were the first to participate in this struggle. The expanding protest movement has caused serious difficulties for the Yoshida government's plot to ratify these two traitorous treaties at the 12th Extraordinary Session of the Diet.
    Since the illegal San Francisco Conference, the American occupation authorities have, on the one hand, instructed the Yoshida government to intensify the persecution of Communists and democratic progressives and suppress strike movements, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Japanese people's opposition to the two traitorous treaties; on the other hand, they have threatened and bribed reactionary Japanese Diet members in order to have these two traitorous treaties approved at the extraordinary session of the Diet. However, no matter what despicable tricks American imperialism employs, they will ultimately gain nothing. The frantic suppression by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries will not only fail to subdue the Japanese people, but will instead further arouse the rising tide of the Japanese people's movement against the separate treaty and for national independence. At the same time, even if the American occupiers can manipulate the Japanese Diet to pass the separate treaty and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, their conspiracy to enslave the Japanese people will ultimately fail in the face of the growing strength of the people.
    In order to escape the tragic fate of being slaves and cannon fodder, the Japanese people are stepping up their unity and strengthening their struggle. The Japanese Peace Protection Committee and the National Congress for Overall Peace and Patriotic Movement should strengthen their leadership of the Japanese people's protest movement against the ratification of the American-made separate treaty and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, so that this movement can be developed more widely and deeply, and carry out a thorough struggle to finally tear up these two treaties. The Japanese people's struggle against the separate treaty and for national independence is not isolated. The Chinese people firmly support this just struggle of the Japanese people; the world's peace movement is encouraging and supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people with tremendous force.

### 日本人民反对批准单独和约

    日本人民反对批准单独和约
    九月十五日，日本拥护和平委员会发表声明，号召日本人民展开反对批准美制单独和约与美日安全条约的抗议运动，并自九月二十日起，发起举行“反对批准单独和约和平月”。日本拥护和平委员会的这个号召，已得到日本人民的热烈响应；日本各工会首先参加这一斗争。日益扩展的抗议运动，已使吉田政府企图在第十二届国会临时会议上批准这两项卖国条约的阴谋遭到严重的困难。
    非法的旧金山会议以后，美国占领当局一面指使吉田政府加紧迫害共产党和民主进步分子，镇压罢工运动，妄图扑灭日本人民反对两项卖国条约的火焰；一面威吓与收买日本反动议员，以便使这两项卖国条约能在国会临时会议上得到批准。然而，任凭美帝国主义运用任何卑劣伎俩，他们到最后将一无所得。美日反动派的疯狂镇压，不仅不能使日本人民屈服，反而更加激起了日本人民反对单独和约、争取民族独立运动的高涨；同时，美国占领者即使能操纵日本国会会议通过单独和约与美日安全条约，而它奴役日本人民的阴谋计划，在日益壮大的人民力量面前，最后也必将失败。
    日本人民为了摆脱奴隶和炮灰的悲惨命运，正加紧团结，加强斗争。日本拥护和平委员会和全面媾和爱国运动协议会，应当加强领导日本人民反对批准美制单独和约与美日安全条约的抗议运动，使这
    一运动能更加广泛、深入地展开，并为最后撕毁这两项条约进行彻底的斗争。日本人民反对单独和约、争取民族独立的斗争并不是孤立的，中国人民坚决支持日本人民这一正义的斗争；全世界人民的保卫和平运动，更以巨大的力量鼓舞与支持着日本人民的正义斗争。
