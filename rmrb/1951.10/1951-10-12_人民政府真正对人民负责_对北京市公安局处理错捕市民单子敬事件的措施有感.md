    The People's Government is Truly Responsible to the People
    -- Thoughts on the Measures Taken by the Beijing Public Security Bureau in Handling the Wrongful Arrest of Citizen Shan Zijing

To the Editor:

    After reading the article "The Process of the Beijing Public Security Bureau's Wrongful Arrest of Citizen Shan Zijing and a Review of This Error" in the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" column on October 5th, I was moved to tears.

    I was reminded of an incident that occurred in June 1943. At that time, the Japanese invaders were rampaging in Jiangxi, and a seminarian named Wang Polo from the Wenshan Seminary of the Catholic Diocese of Yujiang fled to Lichuan County. He was captured by the Kuomintang bandit army. The reactionary judge, without distinction or investigation, added the charge of "traitor" and shot Wang Polo. After the bandit army's atrocities of disregarding human life spread, many Catholics wept, and everyone expressed righteous indignation. But under the reactionary rule and oppression of the Kuomintang, people dared to be angry but dared not speak out.

    After liberation, everything was exactly the opposite of the situation in the era of reactionary rule. In the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau mistakenly arrested citizen Shan Zijing. Thanks to the help of the People's Daily, after the comrades of the Public Security Bureau discovered the wrongful arrest, they not only immediately released Shan Zijing, personally apologized to him, and convened a mass meeting to conduct a review on the spot; they also not only made a public review in the newspaper but also compensated Shan Zijing for the material losses he suffered as a result of the arrest. Such a serious and responsible attitude of the public security personnel can only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    The Shan Zijing incident has educated me and made me further realize that the People's Government is indeed responsible to the people; I also believe that none of the suppressed counter-revolutionaries is without "a case to be investigated, someone to testify, and blood debts to pay." Therefore, from now on, I will definitely intensify my studies, exercise my body, and use practical actions to support all measures of the People's Government.

### 人民政府真正对人民负责——对北京市公安局处理错捕市民单子敬事件的措施有感

    人民政府真正对人民负责
    ——对北京市公安局处理错捕市民单子敬事件的措施有感编辑同志：
    读了十月五日人民日报读者来信栏所载“京市公安局错捕市民单子敬的经过及对这个错误的检讨”一文后，使我感动得流了泪。
    我想起一九四三年六月间的一件事情。那时，日寇在江西窜扰，天主教余江教区文珊修院的一位叫王波罗的修生，逃亡到黎川县。他被国民党匪军抓住了。反动法官不分皂白，不加调查，加上个“汉奸”罪名，就把王波罗枪毙了。匪军草菅人命，丧尽天良的暴行传出之后，许多教友流泪了，人人表示义愤填膺。但在国民党的反动统治和压迫之下，人们是敢怒而不敢言的。
    解放后，一切事情恰恰与反动统治时代的情况相反。北京市人民政府公安局在镇压反革命工作中，错捕了市民单子敬，由于人民日报的帮助，公安局工作同志在发觉捕错之后，不但马上释放了单子敬，亲自向他道歉，并召开群众会，当场作了检讨；不但在报纸上公开检讨，而且赔偿了单子敬因被捕所受的物质损失。公安人员对工作如此认真负责，只有在共产党和毛主席领导之下才能作到。
    单子敬事件教育了我，使我进一步认识到人民政府确实是对人民负责的；我也相信，被镇压的反革命分子之中，是没有一个不是“有案可查，有人作证，血债累累的”。因此，今后我一定加紧学习，锻炼身体，用实际行动来拥护人民政府的一切措施。  北京师范大学  曾康
