    Overseas Chinese Students Returning to Study Are Determined to Strive for the Construction of a Great Motherland

    To the Editor:

    We are a group of overseas Chinese students from various parts of Southeast Asia. After reading the article "Remembering the Love of Overseas Chinese for New China" published in the People's Daily on the 3rd of this month, we were very excited and moved.

    The birth of New China gave us great encouragement. We love our motherland and, regardless of the enemy's various obstructions, have embraced the great motherland. We have personally witnessed our motherland advancing day by day towards the road of freedom, happiness, prosperity, and strength.

    In the past two years, the motherland has made rapid progress. The three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform have achieved great results; all ethnic groups have united as never before; and the political awareness of the people nationwide has been generally improved. We truly understand the true meaning of the saying "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China."

    The People's Government's concern and care for overseas Chinese is meticulous, as demonstrated in facilitating overseas remittances; accommodating returned overseas Chinese who were harmed by imperialism, and introducing them to employment; and running overseas Chinese middle schools, among other things. These facts have educated us and eliminated the national inferiority complex that once existed in our minds. Today, we deeply feel how happy and glorious it is to be a Chinese person. We must implement our enthusiasm for loving the motherland into practical actions, study hard under the banner of patriotism, transform ourselves, and improve our political and ideological level. Strive for the construction of a happy and beautiful life!

    我们回国学习的华侨学生决为建设伟大的祖国而奋斗编辑同志：
    我们是一群来自东南亚各地的华侨学生。我们读了人民日报本月三日登载的“记国外华侨对新中国的热爱”一文后，非常兴奋和激动。
    新中国的诞生，给了我们很大的鼓舞。我们热爱自己的祖国，不顾敌人的种种阻挠，投入了伟大祖国的怀抱。我们亲眼见到祖国一天天地向着自由、幸福、繁荣、富强的大道迈进。
    两年来，祖国在突飞猛进。抗美援朝、镇压反革命与土地改革三大运动已取得了很大的成绩；各民族已经空前团结起来；全国人民政治觉悟已经普遍提高。我们真正地体会到“没有共产党就没有新中国”这句话的真义。
    人民政府对侨胞的关心和爱护是无微不至的，这表现在沟通侨汇；收容被帝国主义残害的归国难侨，给他们介绍职业；举办华侨中学等等事情上。这些事实教育了我们，铲除了我们思想中曾经存在的民族自卑感，我们今天深深地感到做一个中国人是多么的幸福与光荣。我们要把爱祖国的热情贯彻到实际行动中去，在爱国主义的旗帜下，努力学习，改造自己，提高政治思想水平。为建设幸福、美好的生活而奋斗！
