    In memory of Comrade Ren Bishi
    Wang Shoudao

    Comrade Ren Bishi, one of the earliest members and organizers of the Chinese Communist Party, who struggled arduously for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation for thirty years and dedicated his entire life to the revolution, has been gone from us for a whole year. Today, on the anniversary of his death, the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country are all commemorating this outstanding leader of the Party, the brilliant student and close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Mao Zedong, with heavy hearts. His death is a great loss for our Party and for the Chinese people.

    At this time last year, I was in Changsha, and when I heard this unfortunate news, tears welled up in my eyes involuntarily, and I felt extremely sorrowful. I mourned the unfortunate premature death of my beloved mentor!

    I have known Comrade Bishi for a long time. When I was still a member of the Chinese Socialist Youth League, I began to read his articles in the "Chinese Youth" publication. I loved his articles and was inspired by the abundant revolutionary spirit in them. In 1930, due to work reasons, I went to Shanghai from the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border region to study in the Party's secret training class. Comrade Bishi lectured us in the training class, teaching organizational work. In 1931, the Party sent me to work in the Hunan-Jiangxi border region. At that time, he was the Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Bureau of the Soviet Area, and he summoned me for a talk and personally instructed me on my work. In May 1933, Comrade Bishi was sent by the Party Central Committee to the Hunan-Jiangxi border region to serve as the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. Thanks to his leadership, the serious situation caused by the "Left" leaning dogmatic errors within the Party at that time was reversed. He rescued comrades such as Zhang Qilong, Zhang Pinghua, Wang Enmao, and myself from the serious blows of dogmatism. From 1941 to the autumn of 1944, I worked in the Party Central Committee organs in Yan'an and was under the direct leadership of Comrade Bishi. From these personal contacts with him, I felt more deeply that he was one of the Chinese Communist Party leaders with the most outstanding Bolshevik qualities, and he is forever worthy of our learning.

    He was an outstanding statesman. He consistently demonstrated the excellent quality of adhering to political principles in various battles. He was kind and amiable to the masses and comrades; but in his work, in political struggles, from small details of life to the serious moments facing the revolution, he always adhered to the revolutionary stand and never compromised in the slightest. In the reactionary prisons, under torture, he despised the enemy and fought heroically. In the ideological struggles within the Party, he also resolutely fought against various forms of opportunism. At the time of the failure of the 1927 revolution, he and many comrades opposed Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunist line. Later, in Shanghai, he led the Youth League in opposing the "vanguardism" tendency within the League. During the 25,000-li Long March of the people's army—the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—Comrade Bishi, together with Comrades Zhu De, He Long, and Guan Xiangying, jointly led the Second and Fourth Front Armies, overcame the traitor Zhang Guotao's conspiracy to split the Red Army and oppose the Party and the revolution, enabled the correct line of the Party represented by Chairman Mao to be supported by all Red Army commanders and fighters, and victoriously joined forces in northern Shaanxi, promoting the War of Resistance Against Japan. These are all indelible achievements of Comrade Bishi in various revolutionary stages, and they also demonstrate the strength and greatness of his Bolshevik Party spirit.

    In his daily political work, Comrade Bishi's political principles also left me with a deep impression. In the rectification and study movement in the central organs in Yan'an, he was good at distinguishing and correcting the "Left" and right erroneous tendencies. He often reminded us that when examining Party member cadres, on the one hand, we must never be careless or negligent and must raise our political vigilance; on the other hand, we must adhere to principles, carefully study, and then handle the matter. The comrades who worked under his leadership and influence received great education.

    When the Kuomintang reactionaries blockaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, financial resources were extremely difficult, and the struggle behind enemy lines in North China was at its most difficult stage, Comrade Bishi resolutely implemented the policies and guidelines formulated by Chairman Mao and personally arranged for the work of fighting the enemy, reducing rent and increasing production, and streamlining and economizing. He studied the financial and economic work of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in detail and made many specific measures. He took decisive actions to reduce the waste of manpower and material resources without any hesitation. He responded to the Party's call and set an example by participating in production. He and Comrade Peng Dehuai and our staff of the central organs formed a group and participated in production work such as planting cotton in Yangjialing. He lived self-denyingly, strictly abided by the system, and refused any extra enjoyment. Although his position in the Party was very high and the comrades cared for his sick body, he was unwilling to receive any exceptional care.

    Comrade Bishi was a great organizer. He made great achievements in the construction of our Party and the construction of the Youth League. He had outstanding organizational skills and was good at uniting cadres and the masses. He handled work in an orderly manner, even in the most complex events. He was good at finding the central link in the work and patiently dealing with problems. When he worked in the central organs in Yan'an, he was able to arrange the Party's guidelines and tasks determined by Chairman Mao well and promote the progress of the work. Comrade Bishi was one of Chairman Mao's close and excellent assistants.

    Comrade Bishi's political genius was inseparable from his correct working methods and working style. He was diligent in learning, studying Chairman Mao's works, and had a spirit of delving into problems. He was good at investigation and research, liked to read materials, asked comrades about their strengths and weaknesses, was willing to talk deeply, and liked to consult with the masses when things happened, listening to their opinions. He once led the investigation and research office of the central organs. He collected and grasped a large amount of material, analyzed and studied it meticulously, and then formulated policy plans. In the winter of 1947, he personally studied the land reform movement in the Jin-Sui and northern Shaanxi regions in Yangjiagou, Mizhi. The famous report, "Several Issues in Land Reform," was written by him after hard work.

    Although he was a great statesman, he was simple and unsophisticated, just like an ordinary worker. He was good at approaching the masses and good at persuading cadres and the masses. He was sincere and amiable to his comrades. His voice, smile, and love for his comrades still move me deeply whenever I think of them.

    For thirty years, under the correct and brilliant leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong—including Comrade Ren Bishi—our Party has grown into a great and glorious party that has won the trust of the entire Chinese people. Our great victory has been won by countless outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, who fought tirelessly until their death and gave their health and precious lives. Among these outstanding national sons and daughters, Comrade Bishi was one of the most outstanding. We commemorate him, we want to learn from him, and we want to take him as our model. We must respond to the call issued by the Party Central Committee at the time of Comrade Bishi's death: "Learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's example, unite as one, and strive to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, consolidate the national defense of the people's motherland, and continue to develop the people's revolutionary struggle and the cause of the people's construction!" In our great struggle to resist America and aid Korea and oppose American imperialist aggression, in our ideological struggle, in the work of Party rectification and Party building, and in the movement to practice strict economy and increase production, we must learn from his revolutionary spirit of self-sacrifice, learn from his Bolshevik spirit of obeying the truth and adhering to principles, and eliminate the tendency of some staff members to become divorced from the masses, bureaucratic, and corrupt and wasteful.

    Respected Comrade Bishi! We are determined to fight to the end for the success of China's new democratic and communist cause under the leadership of Chairman Mao! (Attached picture)

    纪念任弼时同志
    王首道
    为中国人民解放事业坚苦奋斗了三十年，将自己整个生命献给了革命的、中国共产党的最早的党员和组织家之一——任弼时同志，离开我们已经整一年了。全党全军和全国人民，在今天他的逝世周年日，一致怀着沉痛的心情，来纪念这位党的卓越的领导者之一、毛泽东同志的杰出的学生和亲密的战友。他的逝世是我们党的、也是中国人民的巨大损失。
    去年此时，我在长沙，当我听到这不幸的消息后，不自觉地热泪盈眶，感到万分的悲恸。我痛悼我的亲爱的导师不幸中年逝世！
    我很早就认识弼时同志。当我还是中国社会主义青年团团员的时候，就开始从“中国青年”刊物上读到他的文章，我爱好他的文章，为其中充沛的革命精神所鼓舞。一九三○年，因工作关系，我从湘鄂赣边区到上海，进党的秘密训练班学习。弼时同志在训练班上给我们讲课，教的是组织工作。一九三一年，党派我到湘赣边区工作。那时他担任党的苏区中央局组织部部长，召我谈话，亲自指示工作。一九三三年五月，弼时同志被党中央派到湘赣边区。担任省委书记。由于他的领导，使当时因党内左倾教条主义错误路线而造成的严重局势，得以扭转。他把张启龙、张平化、王恩茂等同志，连同我一起，从教条主义的严重的打击下，拯救出来。从一九四一年起，到一九四四年秋止，我在延安党中央机关工作，一直在弼时同志的直接领导之下。从我个人和他的这些接触中间，使我更深切地感觉到他是具有布尔什维克最优秀的品质的中国共产党的领导人之一，永远值得我们学习。
    他是一个卓越的政治家。在各种战斗中他一贯地表现了坚持政治原则性的卓越品德。他对群众、对同志，和蔼亲切；但在工作中，在政治斗争中，小到生活细节，大到面临革命的严重关头，他永远坚持革命立场，丝毫也不妥协。在反动派的牢狱里，酷刑下，他蔑视敌人，英勇斗争。在党内的思想斗争中，他也坚决地与各种机会主义斗争。在一九二七年革命失败的时候，他和许多同志在一起，反对陈独秀的右倾机会主义路线。其后他在上海领导青年团反对团内的“先锋主义”倾向。在人民的军队——中国工农红军举行二万五千里长征的时候，弼时同志和朱德同志、贺龙同志、关向应同志共同领导二方面军和四方面军，战胜了叛徒张国焘的分裂红军、反党反革命的阴谋，使毛主席所代表的党的正确路线得到了全体红军指战员的拥护，胜利地会师陕北，推动了抗日战争。这些都是弼时同志在各个革命阶段中的不可磨灭的功绩，同时也表现了他的布尔什维克党性的坚强伟大。
    在日常政治工作中，弼时同志的政治上的原则性，也给我以深刻的印象。在延安中央机关整风学习运动中，他善于分清和纠正“左”和右的错误倾向，他经常提醒我们在审查党员干部时，一方面绝对不能麻痹，不能粗心大意，必须提高政治警惕性；一方面要坚持原则，慎重研究，然后处理。在他领导和影响之下的工作同志，都获得了极大的教育。
    当国民党反动派封锁陕甘宁边区、财政极端困难、华北敌后斗争处于最艰苦的阶段时，弼时同志坚决执行毛主席所订的方针和政策，亲自布置对敌斗争、减租生产、精简节约等项工作。他详细地研究过陕甘宁边区财经工作，并作了许多具体的措施。对于减少人力物力的浪费，他采取了断然的处置，不稍犹豫。他响应党的号召，以身作则，参加生产。他和彭德怀同志和我们机关工作人员组织成一个小组，在杨家岭参加过植棉等生产工作。他生活克己，严守制度，拒绝任何额外的享受。虽则他在党内的地位很高，同志们关心爱护他的病体，他也决不愿意得到破例的照顾。
    弼时同志是一个伟大的组织家。他在我们党的建设和团的建设中，创造了巨大的成绩。他有卓越的组织能力，善于团结干部和群众。他处理工作，即使是极复杂的事件，也能够井井有条。他善于找出工作中的中心环节，有耐心地处理问题。他在延安党中央机关中工作时，对毛主席所确定的党的方针任务，能够很好地加以布置，推动工作的进行。弼时同志是毛主席的亲密的优秀的助手之一。
    弼时同志的政治天才是和他的正确的工作方法和工作作风分不开的。他勤于学习，学习毛主席的著作，富于钻研问题的精神。他善于调查研究，喜欢看材料，向同志们问长问短，愿意深谈，喜欢遇事找群众商量，倾听群众的意见。他曾领导中央机关的调查研究室工作。他收集掌握大量的材料，加以细密的分析研究，然后制订政策方案。一九四七年冬季，他在米脂杨家沟亲自研究了晋绥和陕北地区的土地改革运动，“土地改革中的几个问题”这个有名的报告，就是他经过辛勤的研究而著作的。
    他虽然是一个大政治家，可是他朴素单纯，和一个普通的劳动者一样。他善于接近群众，善于说服干部和群众。他对同志诚恳和蔼。他的声音笑貌，对同志的友爱，至今我一回想起来，就衷心感动。
    三十年来，党在毛泽东同志为首的中央——包括任弼时同志在内——的正确英明的领导之下，已经成长起来成为一个伟大的光荣的、取得了全中国人民信赖的党。我们的伟大的胜利是由无数优秀的中国民族的儿女，至死不息地斗争，付出了他们的健康以至宝贵的生命而换来的，在这些优秀的民族儿女中，弼时同志是其中杰出的一个。我们纪念他，我们要学习他，以他为我们的模范。我们要响应党中央在弼时同志逝世时所发出的号召：“学习任弼时同志的榜样，团结一致，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，巩固人民祖国的国防，继续发展人民革命斗争和人民建设事业而奋斗！”在我们的抗美援朝反对美帝国主义侵略的伟大斗争中，在我们的思想斗争中，在整党建党工作中，在厉行节约增加生产的运动中，我们都要学习他的自我牺牲的革命精神，要学习他的服从真理坚持原则的布尔什维克精神，要肃清目前某些工作人员的脱离群众、官僚主义和贪污浪费的倾向。
    敬爱的弼时同志！我们决心在毛主席的领导下为中国新民主主义与共产主义事业的成功而奋斗到底！（附图片）
