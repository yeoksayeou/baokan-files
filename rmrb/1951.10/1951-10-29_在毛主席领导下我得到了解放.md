    Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao, I Was Liberated

    My family lives in Dazhong Street in the northeast corner of Luoyang City. I am nineteen years old this year. I married Zhang Muchuan when I was fifteen. Although I was young when I went to his house, I did everything: reclaiming wasteland, grinding flour, carrying manure, hoeing the fields, fetching water, and cooking. But even so, I was often beaten and scolded by my mother-in-law. After liberation, the wives and daughters of other families all joined the Women's Federation, but I couldn't come out at home. This time, our street carried out democratic reforms and reorganized the Women's Federation. When young women came to mobilize me to join the Women's Federation, my mother-in-law still wouldn't let me come out, but I insisted on coming out. After I was gloriously elected as a women's representative, my mother-in-law was dissatisfied and beat and scolded me at the meeting. Later, with the help of the work team, our family held a family meeting, criticized and examined each other, and only then did we improve the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. My mother-in-law told me to go to night school and allowed me to go to meetings. I will be good to my mother-in-law in the future. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I have been liberated, and I am unspeakably happy. This year on National Day, I specially set a plan for learning, work, and production:

    (1) Learning Plan – I will guarantee to complete my homework at night school every day, without delaying time. I will write thirty large characters and one hundred small characters every day, and learn to read one lesson of a book. I will also guarantee a grade of seventy or above in the semester and try to help others learn as much as possible.

    (2) Work Plan – I will work hard to liberate oppressed women so that they are not oppressed. I will work hard to publicize whatever the government calls for and convey the government's policies to the masses. I will also report to the government in a timely manner any problems that the masses cannot solve.

    (3) Production Plan – In the past, I used fifteen loads of manure per mu of land. From now on, I will guarantee twenty loads of manure. In the past, I weeded millet and wheat twice, but from now on, I will weed three or four times. I will also make one shoe sole every day and produce more to resist America and aid Korea, guaranteeing the completion of the patriotic production increase and donation plan.

    在毛主席领导下我得到了解放
    我家住在洛阳市东北隅大众街，我今年十九岁。我十五岁时与张木川结婚，到他家时虽然年小，可是开荒，推磨，挑粪，锄地，挑水做饭，我啥都干。但就这样，也是经常受婆母打骂。解放后，人家的媳妇闺女都参加了妇联会，我却在家不能出来。这次，我街进行了民主改革，重新组织了妇联会。青年妇女来动员我参加妇联会时，我婆母虽还是不叫我出来，可是我却强着出来了。在我光荣地被选为妇女代表后，婆母心中不满，当会场打骂了我一顿。后来在工作组的帮助下，我家开了家庭会议，互相批评检讨，才搞好了家庭婆媳的关系。婆母叫我去上了夜校，并允许我去开会，我今后也要对婆母好。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我得到了解放，我有说不出的高兴。今年国庆节我特地定了学习、工作和生产计划：
    （一）学习计划——我在夜校所作的作业每日保证完成任务，不拖延时间，每日写大字三十个，小字一百个，读会一课书，学期成绩还保证在七十分以上，并且要尽量的帮助别人学习。
    （二）工作计划——我要努力把受压迫的妇女解放出来，使她们不受压迫。政府有啥号召我努力宣传，并把政府政策传达到群众中去。群众有啥解决不了的问题，我也及时报告给政府。
    （三）生产计划——我往年一亩地上十五担粪，今后保证上二十担粪；往年谷子麦子锄二遍，今后要锄三、四遍。我每天还做鞋底一只，多多的生产来抗美援朝，保证完成爱国增产捐献计划。
