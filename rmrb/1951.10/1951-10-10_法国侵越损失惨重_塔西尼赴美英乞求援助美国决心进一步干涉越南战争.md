Xinhua News Agency, 9th. French Commander-in-Chief of the invading Vietnamese forces, Tatini, after going to the United States in mid-September to beg for aid, went to London on October 4 to discuss a "cooperation" plan with the British authorities against the national liberation movements in Vietnam and other areas of Southeast Asia.

While begging for aid in the United States, Tatini admitted that the French colonialists' war of aggression against Vietnam had suffered great losses. In a public speech in Washington, Tatini said that France had lost more than 100,000 troops on the Indochina battlefield, of which 38,000 were killed (note: this figure is obviously greatly reduced); France had been "maintaining more than half of its professional soldiers and a quarter of its officers" on the Vietnamese battlefield. In addition to the above-mentioned manpower losses and burdens, Tatini also admitted that France was spending more than one billion US dollars annually in financial resources to carry out the war of aggression against Vietnam. Tatini then begged the American masters for greater assistance. On September 23, the US Department of Defense and the State Department issued a joint communique on the talks, stating that the United States was determined to further interfere in the Vietnam War. The communique said: Participants in the consultations all agreed that: "Successfully defending Indochina is extremely important for the defense (!) of the entire Southeast Asia"; the French and American sides "have re-examined the military assistance plan for Indochina, and as a result, there will be considerable improvements in the delivery speed of major military equipment"; the US government is studying "the issue of providing additional assistance to the French forces and Vietnamese forces (i.e., the Bao Dai puppet army) in Indochina in the 1952 fiscal year."

However, the US imperialists' promise to speed up the delivery of military equipment to Indochina obviously cannot improve the miserable situation of the French colonialists in Indochina. Therefore, Tatini went from Paris to London on October 4 to exchange views extensively with British Prime Minister Attlee, Defense Minister Shinwell, and Foreign Secretary Morrison, and held talks with British Chief of Staff Shilling and the heads of the Navy and Air Force. According to a United Press report: Tatini and British military authorities discussed "how to comprehensively coordinate their military issues in the Far East war" and "to what extent they can help each other in combat." Their ultimate goal is to attempt to establish a "Far East Unified Command."

The London "Worker's Daily" commented on Tatini's visit to London, pointing out that Tatini came to Britain to ask the British army to participate in the war against the Vietnamese people. The newspaper said: "France has suffered extremely heavy losses in Indochina, so that if troops are not increased, the weapons promised by Washington will not have much effect." However, the situation of British imperialism in Malaya is not better than that of the French colonialists in Indochina. The Iranian people have forced British imperialism to replay a "shameful Dunkirk" in Abadan. It is doubtful how much help this stretched-thin imperialist can give to its French partner.

### 法国侵越损失惨重  塔西尼赴美英乞求援助美国决心进一步干涉越南战争

    法国侵越损失惨重
    塔西尼赴美英乞求援助美国决心进一步干涉越南战争
     【新华社九日讯】侵越法军总司令塔西尼在九月中旬赴美乞援以后，又在十月四日前往伦敦，和英国当局商讨反对越南及东南亚其他地区民族解放运动的“配合”计划。
    塔西尼在美国乞求援助时，承认法国殖民者侵略越南的战争已遭到很大的损失。塔西尼在华盛顿作公开演说时说：法国在印度支那战场上已损失十万以上的兵力，其中被击毙的达三万八千人（按：这个数字显然是大大缩小了的）；法国一直在越南战场上“保持着一半以上的职业兵和四分之一的军官”。除了上述人力的损失和负担以外，塔西尼又承认，法国为进行侵略越南的战争，在财政上每年要消耗十亿美元以上。塔西尼于是乞求美国主子给以更大的援助。九月二十三日，美国国防部和国务院就这次谈判发表了一个联合公报，表示美国决心进一步地干涉越南战争。公报说：参加商谈者都同意：“顺利地保卫印度支那，对于整个东南亚的防御（！）是极其重要的”；法美双方“曾经重新研究了给予印度支那的军事援助计划，结果，关于主要军事装备的交货速度，将有相当大的改进”；美国政府正在研究“关于在一九五二年会计年度给予在印度支那的法国部队和越南部队（即保大傀儡军）额外援助的问题”。
    但是，美帝国主义者答应加速运送军事装备至印度支那，显然并不能改善法国殖民者在印度支那的悲惨地位。因此，塔西尼又于十月四日自巴黎前往伦敦，和英国首相艾德礼、国防大臣辛威尔及外交大臣莫里逊广泛地交换意见，并和英国参谋总长史陵及海空军首长举行了会谈。据合众社消息：塔西尼和英国军事当局讨论了“如何全盘协调他们在远东战争中的军事问题”，以及“作战时能够互助到什么程度”，其最后目的，是企图成立一个“远东作战统一指挥部”。
    伦敦“工人日报”在评论塔西尼访问伦敦时指出：塔西尼来到英国，为的是要求英军参加进攻越南人民的战争。该报说：“法国在印度支那的损失极为惨重，以致若不增加军队，华盛顿方面所答应给的军火，是不会有什么很大效用的。”然而，英帝国主义者在马来亚的情况，并不比法国殖民者在印度支那的情况要好些。伊朗人民已经迫使英帝国主义在阿巴丹重演了一次“丢脸的敦刻尔克”。这个捉襟见肘的帝国主义者究竟能给其法国伙伴以多少的援助，是很可怀疑的。
