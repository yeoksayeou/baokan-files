    Section Seven: Long Sentences
    Levels and Connections. Generally speaking, the length of a sentence depends on the complexity of the meaning. Some beginners like to lengthen sentences, thinking that this is the only way to show their writing ability, which is certainly a mistake. But if we say indiscriminately that all long sentences are undesirable, that is also a bias. However, the general situation now is that long sentences are used a bit too much, especially in articles for the working class as the main readers.
    When a sentence is long, it is easy to have problems in structure. There have been some examples in the fourth lecture. Now, let's not talk about this, but only discuss how to make the sentence easy to read and understand for the sake of the reader, even if it is long. First of all, we must pay attention to the levels and connections inside the sentence. For example: (1) Starting from such a class foundation, the bourgeoisie's nationalism program and policy on national issues are: within its own country, to make the interests of the entire people subordinate to the interests of its class, to put the interests of its class or a certain upper stratum among them above the interests of the national people, and to attempt to monopolize the name of "nation," declaring themselves as the representatives of the nation or the protectors of the nation's interests, as a tool to deceive the people; at the same time, abroad, to oppose the interests of their own nation (in essence, referring to its upper class) to the interests of other nations, attempting to place their own nation above other nations, and when possible, to oppress and exploit other nations, sacrificing the interests of other nations, and dividing a portion from foreign plunder to buy off a portion of the people in the country, to ease and split the opposition of their own people to it. (Liu Shaoqi) This sentence is not short, but we read it without any effort, because the levels are clear, and there are appropriate words (with side dots) to explain the relationship between each part. Now, let's give a few examples of unclear levels and unclear connections: (2a) In 1949 and the first half of 1950, the vast majority of factories could only maintain four days and four nights or three days and three nights of work per week. The second quarter after March 1950, because prices were stable and social false purchasing power disappeared, therefore, in the first three quarters of 1950, most factories were in a state of shutdown and reduced production, and only in the fourth quarter did they fully utilize the existing production capacity. (Periodical) (2b) In 1949 and the first quarter of 1950, the vast majority of factories could already only maintain four days and four nights or three days and three nights of work per week. After March 1950, prices stabilized and false purchasing power disappeared, and the situation was even worse. Generally speaking, in the first three quarters of 1950, most factories were in a state of shutdown and reduced production, and only in the fourth quarter did they fully utilize the existing production capacity. The big problem with (2a) is that the time aspect is confusing: first it says how things were in "the first half of 1950," then it separately raises "the second quarter" to say, and below it is "the first three quarters of 1950." In the middle, "because" and "therefore" are used to connect, as if the shutdown and reduced production in the first three quarters were all because of the price stability and disappearance of false purchasing power from the second quarter onwards. How can this make sense? Now, the revised draft is like (2b), which is much clearer. The original only made one sentence, which should really be divided into three sentences.
    (3a) The new record movement in Andong City, under the leadership of the Party, first launched large-scale publicity and mobilization work in various factories throughout the city, which played a huge role in conveying the instructions of the Party and the government, improving the labor enthusiasm of the masses, cultivating the political consciousness of the masses, and moving the new record movement from individual to collective, from partial to whole, from universal to in-depth. (Book)
    (3b) The new record movement in Andong City was carried out in this way: First, under the leadership of the Party, a large-scale publicity and mobilization work was launched in various factories throughout the city. This work played a huge role in conveying the instructions of the Party and the government, and in improving the political consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the masses; in this way, this new record movement could develop from individual to collective, from partial to whole, and reach the point of not only being universal but also in-depth.
    (3a) is not only unclear in its levels, but also has structural problems. The "New Record Movement in Andong City" at the beginning seems to be the subject of the whole sentence, but it cannot be coordinated with the following "launching publicity and mobilization work" and "playing a huge role." There is also a missing indispensable verb between "moving the new record movement from individual" and "to collective." The final "from universal to in-depth" is also incomprehensible.
    (4a) When Comrade Li Lisan reported on the situation of the Chinese workers' movement, he further made a detailed introduction to how the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, adopted various complex struggle methods and organizational forms to carry out combat in the thirty-year long struggle, explaining how the Chinese working class united with the peasants who accounted for eighty percent of the population and won their firm support, led them to carry out the land revolution, united the broad urban petty bourgeoisie, especially the revolutionary intellectuals, separated the national bourgeoisie who opposed imperialism from the bourgeoisie who surrendered to imperialism, regarded them as a national united front, established their own leadership, organized a strong People's Liberation Army, and carried out a long-term armed struggle, until they achieved national victory and established a people's democratic dictatorship of the people's republic led by the working class. (Periodical)
    (4b) Comrade Li Lisan... (the middle is the same as the original)... made a detailed introduction. He explained how the Chinese working class united with the peasants who accounted for 80% of the population and won their firm support, leading them to carry out the land revolution; how to unite the broad urban petty bourgeoisie, especially the revolutionary intellectuals; how to separate the national bourgeoisie who opposed imperialism from the bourgeoisie who surrendered to imperialism; how to form a united front with these several classes, while establishing their own leadership; how to organize a strong People's Liberation Army and carry out a long-term armed struggle... (the rest is the same as the original).
    The order of the parts in (4a) is not wrong, but it is just saying it in a flowing style, with a little unclear outline. Adding a few "how," the levels become clear. There is a problem with the original "regard them as a national united front": the "them" is not clear, and according to the preceding text, it seems to refer only to the national bourgeoisie; the "national united front" was only implemented during the Anti-Japanese War, which includes components other than the peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie mentioned here; the verb "regard" is also inappropriate.
    (5a) The basic conditions for the implementation of economic accounting in Lüda are: one is the division of labor between enterprises and factories, with factories only responsible for production, raw materials are priced according to the standards set by the enterprise company, and costs are calculated according to this standard price, and factories are not responsible for sales, so that industrial operations are not affected by price fluctuations, and industrial profits and losses are not confused with commercial profits and losses; the other is that the work of setting production quotas and staffing levels has been largely completed. The basis of the work of setting quotas and staffing levels is that workers have made certain achievements in political and technical studies, so that the problem of many workers with low skills caused by Japan's cheap labor policy in Lüda is overcome, workers voluntarily reduce the number of people in the workshop, and because they have mastered the technology, even with fewer people, they can complete the original tasks. For example, the Dalian Iron and Steel Factory only started the work of setting quotas and staffing levels after a year of political and technical spare-time study. After the implementation of quotas and staffing levels, the labor organization is closely integrated with the machinery, the machine specialization system is implemented, and manual labor is reduced to the minimum limit, revealing the production power of each machine and workshop, providing a basic basis for the economic accounting system. For example, the glass factory estimates that each square meter of finished glass accounts for 40.7 seconds of each worker's work day, and the actual goal is to complete it in 17.7 seconds. This number calculated in seconds is one of the important bases for cost calculation. (Book)
    (5b) Lüda can implement economic accounting because it already has two basic conditions: one is the implementation of the division of labor between enterprises and factories, and the other is that the work of setting quotas and staffing levels has been largely completed. After the implementation of the division of labor between enterprises and factories, the factories are only responsible for production... (the middle is the same as the original)... Industrial profits and losses will not be confused with commercial profits and losses. After the implementation of the quota and staffing system, the labor organization is closely integrated with the machinery... (the middle is the same as the original)... Economic accounting has a basic basis (such as a glass factory... (the middle is the same as the original)... Is the basis for cost calculation). But the quota and staffing system must be implemented after workers have made certain achievements in political and technical studies. Especially in Lüda, the past Japanese cheap labor policy has caused the problem of many workers with low skills. The system can only be started after the workers' political consciousness has been improved, they voluntarily reduce the number of people in the workshop, and because they have mastered the technology, even with fewer people, they can complete the original tasks (like the Dalian Iron and Steel Factory, they only started the quota and staffing work after a year of political and technical spare-time study).
    (5a) has two main problems. First, on the one hand, it is necessary to explain why the division of labor between enterprises and factories and the quota and staffing system are the basic conditions for the implementation of the economic accounting system, and on the other hand, it is necessary to describe the implementation process of Lüda. The explanatory part and the narrative part are mixed together and not clearly divided. Second, perhaps more importantly, the implementation of the quota and staffing system must be based on a certain political level and technical level. This is another meaning, and it should be made another sentence. It should not be inserted in the middle to increase the confusion.
    (5b) divides this sentence into five sentences, and also uses parentheses in two places, which is much clearer than the original.
    Awkward speaking and smooth speaking. According to Chinese habits, the paragraph under the causal conjunctions (such as "due to," "regarding," "for the sake of," "except for," "at," "from," etc.) should not be too long. If it is too long, the listener will not be able to take care of it. It may be slightly better to write it on paper, but it still cannot be too long. If it is too long, it is tongue-twisting to read, and it is not easy to quickly grasp the meaning of the whole sentence. This way of speaking is awkward, and we can call it "awkward speaking." This method is rarely indispensable (sometimes it cannot be avoided in official documents), and most of them can change the structure, smooth it out, and make it close to normal speech. You can compare the following two sentences:
    (6a) Although the casualties in this accident were less than the gas explosion in the Longfeng Mine, from the fact that the accident could have been completely avoided, only due to the leadership's adoption of bureaucracy, indifference to the safety of workers, and ignoring the workers' repeated reflections, the severity of the accident exceeded the gas explosion accident. (Report)
    (6b) Although the workers who were killed or injured in this accident were less than those in the gas explosion in the Longfeng Mine, this accident could have been completely avoided, only due to the leadership... (the middle is the same as the original)... The accident happened; from this point of view, its severity exceeds the gas explosion accident in the Longfeng Mine. The original sentence is too long between "from" and "in terms of," which should be avoided. The position of "severity" is also wrong.
    (7a) But when they first came, the comrades who recruited workers verbally promised treatment conditions that were too high, such as the environment on Baotian Road being very good, with tile houses to live in, hospitals, flour could be sent home, and at least nine pounds of noodles per person per day, etc., and because no preparations were made before coming to the team, the workers had no place to live after they came, so they slept on the railway tracks, on cement houses and cement bags, and in restaurants because there were no cooking utensils, and they exchanged one pound of flour for a bowl of noodles, and some people had not received their resettlement fees, etc., the masses' emotions were very chaotic. (Manuscript)
    (7b) But before they came, the comrades who recruited workers verbally promised treatment conditions that were too high... (the middle is the same as the original)... etc.; after they came, it was because the team headquarters had not made preparations in advance, so there was no place to sleep... (the middle is the same as the original)... Some people have not even received their resettlement fees—due to these reasons, the emotions of the masses are very bad. The paragraph after "due to" in the original sentence is too long. After changing it to the form of (7b), it is avoided.
    (8a) However, in order to avoid the disparate prices of certain commodities due to the lack of uniform currency system and the excessive impact caused by the sudden unification of the currency system, so that industry and commerce suffer unnecessary impact, the government has decided to temporarily take appropriate management measures for a very small number of materials. (Report)
    (8b) However, in the past, because the currency system was not unified, the prices of some commodities [in Guan Nei and the Northeast] had a large distance, and the sudden unification of the currency system would have an excessive impact on it, and industry and commerce would suffer unnecessary impacts as a result. In order to avoid this possible situation, the government has decided... (the rest is the same as the original). In addition to the fact that it is too long between "for the sake of" and "purpose," there is an extra comma after "price," "disparate prices" is too brief, and it is unclear whether "price" is the subject or object of "happen... impact," which also adds to the difficulty of understanding this sentence.
    The long appositive mentioned in Section 4 of Lecture 4 is actually also a kind of "awkward speaking." Here are two more sentences as examples:
    (9a) The Korean People's Observation Delegation, invited by the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, to participate in the celebration ceremony of our National Day, arrived in Beijing this morning. (Report)
    (9b) The Korean People's Observation Delegation, invited by the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression... (the middle is the same as the original)... To participate in the celebration ceremony of our National Day, arrived in Beijing this morning.
    (10a) As everyone knows, the American ruling group has a long history of interfering in China's internal affairs. This act of interference has been carried out repeatedly for a long time, and the kind of illegal action currently implemented by the American government on China's Taiwan Island is only a new link in a long chain of various interference actions of the American ruling group in providing military equipment to the Kuomintang reactionaries, in supporting the Kuomintang reactionaries against the Chinese people's national liberation movement (although no matter what, it is all hopeless and stupid to continue the struggle against this great people's movement for Chinese national liberation and unity). (Report)
    (10b) (The first sentence is the same as the original.) For a long time, it has repeatedly provided military equipment to the Kuomintang reactionaries and supported the Kuomintang reactionaries in the struggle against the Chinese people's national liberation movement (the content in parentheses is the same as the original). The illegal action currently implemented by the American government on China's Taiwan Island is only a new link in a long chain of these various interference actions.
    The "Korean People's Observation Delegation" in (9a) is the most important word in this sentence, and it is best to let it meet the reader sooner.
    The distance between "is" and "link" in (10a) is so far, that it will also confuse the reader.
    The popularity of this kind of "awkward speaking" syntax is naturally partly influenced by translated articles, and partly because the author wants to use this to show off his writing "skills." Little do they know that this kind of "skill" is very cheap. Please see this sentence:
    (11a) When I walked into the spacious hall of the exhibition, which was hanging nearly a hundred or so Chinese paintings, I was first attracted by Mr. Qi Baishi's vivid, magnificent, and fresh expressions, which made people feel the vastness and great creative spirit of our Chinese nation, and made some of the works with large dimensions and strong colors next to it appear dull in comparison. This is because we deliberately altered a good original text into this appearance, so that people who love this kind of syntax can "appreciate" it. The original text is divided into four sentences, copied at the back. The difference between beauty and ugliness is obvious, and the reader can easily distinguish them.
    (11b) At a certain exhibition, in a spacious hall, there were nearly a hundred or so Chinese paintings hanging. I walked in and was first attracted by Mr. Qi Baishi's works. These works had vivid, magnificent, and fresh expressions, which made us feel the vastness and great creative spirit of our Chinese nation. Although the works next to it had large dimensions and strong colors, in comparison, they seemed to lack vitality and appeared dull. (Report)

    语法、修辞讲话（第五讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第七段  长句
    层次和关节。一般地说，句子的长短决定于意思的繁简。有些初学的人喜欢把句子拉长，以为非如此不足以表示他的写作能力，这固然是一种错误；可是如果无分别地说，凡是长句子都要不得，那也是一种偏向。不过现在的一般情形是长句子用得太多了一点；在工农大众为主要读者的文章里，尤其不相宜。
    句子一长，就容易在结构上出毛病，第四讲里已经有过一些例子。现在不谈这个，只讨论为读者打算，如何能使句子虽长，读起来还是不费力，容易懂。这，首先要注意句子内部的层次和关节。举一个例：（一）从这样的阶级基础出发，资产阶级的民族主义关于民族问题的纲领和政策就是：在自己国内，要使整个人民的利益服从于它这一阶级的利益，把它这一阶级或其中某一上层阶层的利益放在全国人民的利益之上，并企图由他们垄断“民族”这个名义，宣布自己是本民族的代表或本民族利益的保护人，以作为欺骗人民的工具；同时，在国外，则把自己民族（实质上是指它的上层阶级）和其他民族的利益对立起来，企图把自己民族放在其他民族之上，在可能的时候，就去压迫和剥削其他民族，以其他民族的利益为牺牲，并从国外的掠夺中分出一部分以收买国内一部分人，去和缓与分裂本国人民对于它的反对。（刘少奇）这个句子不算短，可是我们读下去毫不费力，就是因为层次分明，并且有适当的词语（加旁点的）把各部分的关系交代明白。现在再举几个层次不明、关节不显的例子：（二甲）在一九四九年与一九五○年上半年，绝
    大多数的工厂，都只能维持每星期开工四日四夜或三日三夜，一九五○年三月以后的第二季，因为物价稳定，社会虚假购买力消失，因此，在一九五○年的前三个季度内，大多数的工厂都在停工减产的状态中，仅到第四季度，才充分的利用了现有的生产能力。（期）（二乙）在一九四九年和一九五○年的第一季，绝大多数的工厂已经都只能维持每星期开工四日四夜或三日三夜。一九五○年三月以后，物价稳定，虚假购买力消失，情形更坏。一般地说，一九五○年前三个季度，大多数工厂都在停工减产的状态中，只有到了第四季，才充分利用了现有的生产能力。（二甲）的大毛病是时间方面说得混乱：先说“一九五○上半年”如何如何，接着又单独提出“第二季”来说，下面又是“一九五○年的前三个季度”。当中又用“因为”和“因此”来连接，仿佛前三个季度的停工减产都是因为从第二季度起的物价稳定与虚假购买力消失，这怎么说得通呢？现在改拟如（二乙），就清楚多了。原文只作一句，实在应该分做三句。
    （三甲）安东市的新纪录运动，在党的领导下，首先在全市各工厂中开展大规模的宣传鼓动工作，对于传达党和政府的指示，提高群众的劳动积极性，培养群众政治觉悟，把新纪录运动从个体到集体、局部到全体、普遍到深入，起了巨大的作用。（书）
    （三乙）安东市的新纪录运动是这样进行的：首先，在党的领导下，在全市各工厂中展开大规模的宣传鼓动工作，这个工作在传达党和政府的指示上，在提高群众的政治觉悟和劳动积极性上，起了巨大的作用；这样，这个新纪录运动才能从个别发展到集体，从局部发展到全体，并且达到不但普遍而且深入的地步。
    （三甲）不但层次不明，结构上也有毛病。头上的“安东市新纪录运动”好像是全句的主语，但是和下面的“开展宣传鼓动工作”和“起了巨大的作用”都不能配合。“把新纪录运动从个体”和“到集体”中间也缺少一个必不可少的动词。最后的“从普遍到深入”也费解。
    （四甲）李立三同志在报告中国工人运动情况的时候，更进一步把中国工人阶级与中国人民在中国共产党领导下从事三十年长期斗争中如何采取各种复杂的斗争方法与组织形式进行战斗的经过作了一个详尽的介绍，说明中国工人阶级怎样与占人口百分之八十农民联合起来，并取得他们的坚决拥护，领导他们进行了土地革命，团结广大的城市小资产阶级，尤其是革命知识分子，把反对帝国主义的民族资产阶级与投降帝国主义的资产阶级分开，将他们当作民族统一战线，树立自己的领导权，组织强大的人民解放军，进行长期武装斗争，以至取得了全国的胜利，建立以工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政的人民共和国。（期）
    （四乙）李立三同志……（中间同原文）……作了一个详尽的介绍。他说明中国工人阶级怎样与占人口百分之八十的农民联合起来，并取得他们的坚决拥护，领导他们进行了土地革命；怎样团结广大的城市小资产阶级，尤其是革命知识分子；怎样把反对帝国主义的民族资产阶级与投降帝国主义的资产阶级分开；怎样和这几个阶级组成统一战线，同时树立自己的领导权；怎样组织强大的人民解放军，进行长期武装斗争……（下同原文）。
    （四甲）里面各部分的次序并不错，只是流水式的说下去，有点眉目不清。加上几个“怎样”，层次就分明了。原文“将他们当作民族统一战线”颇有毛病：“他们”所指不明，承上文似乎只指民族资产阶级；“民族统一战线”是只在抗日战争这一个时期实行的，其中包括这里所说的农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级以外的成分；“当作”这个动词也不妥。
    （五甲）旅大实行经济核算制的基本条件，一个是企业与工厂分工，工厂只负责生产，原材料由企业公司定出标准价格，根据这个标准价格，计算成本，工厂不负营业之责，这样工业经营不受物价波动的影响，不致把工业盈亏与商业盈亏相混淆；另一个是生产定员定额工作大致完成，定员定额工作的基础是在工人政治学习和技术学习有了一定成绩之后，这样才克服了日本在旅大贱价劳工政策所造成的工人多技术低的毛病，工人自愿减低车间人数，而且因为已经掌握了技术，人数虽少也能完成原来的任务，像大连钢铁工厂就是经过一年的政治技术业余学习，才开始定额定员工作的，实行定额定员以后，劳动组织与机械密切地结合起来，实行机器专责制，减少人工至最少限度，显露出各个机械、车间的生产力量，给经济核算制度提供了基本的根据，如玻璃工厂预计每一平方米玻璃成品占每一工人劳动日的四十分七秒，实际是争取在十七分七秒完成的，这个以秒计算的数字是成本计算的重要根据之一。（书）
    （五乙）旅大之能实行经济核算制，因为已经具备两个基本条件：一个是实行企业与工厂分工，一个是定员定额工作已大致完成。实行企业与工厂分工以后，工厂只负责生产……（中间同原文）……不致把工业盈亏与商业盈亏相混淆。实行定员定额制以后，劳动组织与机械密切地结合起来……（中间同原文）……经济核算才有基本的根据（如玻璃工厂……（中间同原文）……是成本计算的根据之一）。但是定员定额制又必须在工人的政治学习和技术学习有了一定成绩之后才能实行。尤其在旅大，过去日本人的贱价劳工政策已经造成了工人多技术低的毛病，必须工人的政治觉悟已经提高，自愿减低车间人数，而且因为已经掌握了技术，人数虽少也能完成原来的任务，这个制度才能着手实施（像大连钢铁工厂就是经过一年的政治
        与技术业余学习，才开始定员定额工作的）。
    （五甲）有两个主要的毛病。第一，一方面要说明企业与工厂分工和定员定额制何以是实行经济核算制的基本条件，一方面要叙述旅大的实施经过，这说明的部分和叙述的部分夹杂一起，没划分清楚。其次，也许是更重要的，实行定员定额制必须以一定的政治水平和技术水平为基础，这是另外一个意思，要另作一句，不应该插在中间说，增加混乱。
    （五乙）把这一句分成五句，还在两处应用括号，比原文清楚得多。
    拗着说和顺着说。按汉语的习惯，引起性的关联词（如“由于”“对于”“为了”“除了”“在”“从”等等）底下的那一段话不宜于过长，长了听的人就会照顾不过来。写在纸上也许稍为好一点，可还是不能太长，太长了念起来绕口，也不容易很快地把握全句的意思。这种说话的方式别别扭扭的，我们试称它为“拗着说”。这种方式很少是非用不可的（公文里有时候不能避免），多半能改换结构，把它顺过来，使它跟平常说话接近些。可以比较下面这两句：
    （六甲）这次事故，工友伤亡虽比龙凤矿瓦斯爆发事件为少，但从事故的完全可以避免，仅由于领导上采取官僚主义，对于工人的安全漠不关心，对于工人的屡次反映都置之不理，因而造成事故的严重程度来说，却超过了瓦斯爆发事故。（报）
    （六乙）这次事故中伤亡的工友虽然比龙凤矿瓦斯爆发事故中少，但这次事故是完全可以避免的，仅仅由于领导上……（中间同原文）
        ……才发生事故；从这一点来看，它的严重程度是超过龙凤矿瓦斯爆发事故的。这一句原文的“从”和“来说”中间太长了，应该避免。“严重程度”的位置也不对。
    （七甲）但刚来时由于招工的同志口头允许待遇条件过高，如宝天路环境很好，有瓦房住，有医院，面粉可给送回家，小工每人每天至少九斤面等，加以来队时事先未作准备，以致工人来后没有地方住，就睡在铁道上、洋灰房洋灰袋上、以及饭馆场棚里，吃饭因无炊具而在饭馆里吃饭，用一斤面粉换一碗面条，还有人安家费没有领到等原因，群众情绪非常混乱。（稿）
    （七乙）但他们未来之先，招工的同志口头允许待遇条件过高……（中间同原文）……等；既来之后，又因队部事先未作准备，以致没有地方睡……（中间同原文）……有人连安家费还没有领到——由于这种种原因，群众的情绪非常恶劣。这一句原文的“由于”后面的一段太长，念了半天才念到“原因”，改成（七乙）的样子就避免了。
    （八甲）但为了避免由于币制不统一而形成某些商品的悬殊价格，因币制突然统一而发生过猛的冲击，以致工商业遭受不必要的影响起见，政府已决定对极少数几种物资，暂时采取适当的管理。（报）
    （八乙）但过去因为币制不统一，有些商品的价格〔在关内和东北〕有很大的距离，币制突然统一将予以过猛的冲击，工商业会因此遭受不必要的影响。为了避免这种可能发生的情形，政府已决定……（下同原文）。除“为了”和“起见”中间太长外，“价格”后面多了个逗号，“悬殊价格”太简括，“价格”是“发生……冲击”的主语抑宾语不明确，这些也都增加这句话的难懂的程度。
    第四讲第四段里谈到的长附加语其实也是“拗着说”的一种。这里再引两句做例：
    （九甲）应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会和中苏友好协会的邀请，前来参加我国国庆节庆祝典礼的朝鲜人民观礼代表团在今天上午到达北京。（报）
    （九乙）朝鲜人民观礼代表团，应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会……（中间同原文）………的邀请，前来参加我国国庆节庆祝典礼，在今天上午到达北京。
    （十甲）大家知道，美国统治集团干涉中国内政，是有其悠久历史的。这个干涉行动是长久以来一再实行过的，而目前美国政府对中国的台湾岛所实行的那种非法行动，只不过是美国统治集团在与国民党反动派以军事装备上、在支持国民党反动派反对中国人民的民族解放运动的斗争上（虽然无论怎样，对这种争取中国民族解放与统一的伟大人民运动继续斗争全都是绝望而且愚蠢的）各种干涉行动的一长串锁炼中新的一环而已。（报）
    （十乙）（第一句同原文。）长久以来，它一再予国民党反动派以军事装备，支持国民党反动派反对中国人民的民族解放运动的斗争（括号内同原文），目前美国政府对中国的台湾岛所实行的那种非法行动不过是这种种干涉行动的一长串锁炼中新的一环而已。
    （九甲）的“朝鲜人民观礼代表团”是这一句里最重要的字眼，最好让它和读者早点见面。
    （十甲）的“是”和“一环”隔得这么远，也是要叫读者搞不清的。
    这种“拗着说”的句法之流行，一部分自然是受了翻译文章的影响，也有一部分是作者要借此卖弄他的写作“技巧”。殊不知这种“技巧”是很廉价的。请看这一句：
    （十一甲）当我走进那展览会的挂着将近百十幅国画的宽大的厅堂时，我首先被齐白石先生的神态生动，壮丽清新，令人感到我们中华民族的磅礴气魄和伟大的创造精神，而使旁边的幅面很大，颜色浓重的作品，相形之下显得灰暗的一些作品吸引住。这是我们故意把一段很好的原文点窜成这副模样，让爱好这种句法的人“欣赏”的。原文分四句，抄在后面。美丑悬殊，读者不难辨别。
    （十一乙）在某次展览会上，一间宽大的厅堂里，挂着将近百十幅的国画。我走了进去，首先被齐白石先生的作品吸引住。这些作品神态生动，壮丽清新，使我们感到了我们中华民族的磅礴气魄和伟大的创造精神。尽管旁边的作品幅面很大，颜色浓重，但相形之下，就似乎神气不足，显得灰暗。（报）
            （本段完，全文未完）
