Cotton Grade Price Difference Table
(Announced by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government)
Effective October 1, 1951

Note: 1. Length is measured in units of 1/32 inches. Grades between two levels are marked with a "+" sign, and the price difference is calculated at half the value. For example, 23/32 inch white cotton, medium grade, should be 101.5%; lower medium grade "+" white cotton 7/8 inch should be 98.5%.
    2. When purchasing cotton, coarse cotton and fine cotton have the same price for the same grade. Coarse cotton below 3/4 inch is calculated as 3/4 inch. When the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company delivers to the yarn factory, the coarse cotton is calculated at 96% of the price of fine cotton of the same grade, and the coarse cotton below 3/4 inch is calculated at 96% of the 3/4 inch fine cotton price.
    3. For yellow cotton of superior grade and above, 1 inch and above is calculated as 1 inch; for medium grade and below, 7/8 inch and above is calculated as 7/8 inch.
    4. Yellow-white mixed cotton is priced at 90% of the price calculated separately for yellow and white cotton.
    5. The plus or minus percentages in the grade difference regulations are calculated cumulatively. (Attached chart)
