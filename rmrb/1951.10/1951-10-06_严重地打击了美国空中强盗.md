Severely Crushing the American Air Bandits
People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Yan Shukuai

I am an anti-aircraft artilleryman in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Our mission is to guard a river bridge, which is an important supply line. On February 11th of this year, our first battle since going abroad began, and bombs dropped by enemy planes exploded near our fortifications. I am a No. 1 gunner, and I calmly aimed at the target, but the gun malfunctioned. The artillery technician said it had to be taken to the factory for repair. I thought, if the gun has a problem and goes to the factory, how can we fight? So the No. 2 gunner and I inspected it, found the problem, and fixed it. In less than ten minutes, our gun was firing perfectly, and we and our brother units shot down an enemy plane together.

On the evening of June 25th, an enemy bomber flew in from the southeast. The ground artillery immediately opened fire. I was on the gun, using the sight to aim at the plane, when I suddenly felt a gust of cold wind rushing down from above. I knew a bomb was falling. At that moment, I braced myself, thinking, "At this most critical moment, I cannot leave my post, cannot let the enemy planes take advantage of the situation, I must persevere in the battle." So I gripped the direction wheel tightly. Five bombs exploded in an area from one meter to nine meters away from me. After a deafening roar, I found my lower body buried in the soil, and my hand touched blood. I wasn't afraid of that, but I was very worried because I didn't know how my comrades were, or if the gun was damaged. When I was in the hospital, I still thought about whether my gun continued to participate in the battle.

After returning to the unit with six wounds, I participated in the battle again. But as soon as the gun fired, my ears completely lost their hearing, my head ached a little, and my back arm didn't work as well as before. Despite this, I was not pessimistic. I immediately remembered what the Party had taught me: "There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of a Communist Party member." The power of this sentence encouraged me and made me work harder than before. I sat on the gun mount all day, operating the direction wheel, practicing hard with my right arm. Sometimes it hurt terribly, but I gritted my teeth and persevered. When I couldn't hear the commands, I had the No. 3 gunner behind me tap my back with his leg as a signal. When my head hurt, I leaned hard against the backrest. After practicing hard like this for a period of time, I was able to participate in the battle well again.

Since going abroad to fight, our unit has shot down a total of thirty-five enemy planes and damaged one hundred and two, of which my comrades and I shot down six and damaged twelve. We are fully confident that we will severely strike the American air bandits in the future, until we drive them out of Korea! (Attached picture)

    严重地打击了美国空中强盗
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  阎书魁
    我是中国人民志愿军的一个高射炮兵，我们的任务是守卫一座江桥，这是一条重要的补给线。今年二月十一日，我们出国后第一次的战斗开始了，敌机投下的炸弹就在我们的工事附近爆炸开来。我是一炮手，我沉着地瞄着目标，但是炮发生了故障，炮工来说要拉到工厂里去修，我想炮有了毛病就进工厂，仗怎样打呢？于是我和二炮手就进行了检查，找到了毛病把它修好了。不到十分钟，我们的炮就打得呱呱叫，我们和兄弟部队共同打落一架敌机。
    六月二十五日晚上，敌人的一架轰炸机从东南方向飞来，地面上的火炮立刻就打响了。我正在炮上用瞄准器对准飞机的方向，猛觉一阵冷风从头上扑下来，我知道这是炸弹落下来了，这时我心里一横，我想：“最危急的关头，我不能离开岗位，不能让敌机钻空子，我要坚持战斗。”于是我用手紧紧地抓住方向转轮。五颗炸弹在离我一公尺到九公尺的地区爆炸了，在一阵震人的巨响过后，我发现自己的下半身被埋在土里，手摸到了鲜血，这我倒并不害怕，但我非常着急，因为我不知道我的战友们怎样了，炮损坏了没有。当我住在医院里时，依然时刻想到我的炮是否继续参加了战斗。
    我带着六处伤口回到部队后，又参加了战斗。但在炮一打响的时候，我的两个耳朵就完全听不到声音，脑子有些疼，后臂也不如以前好使唤了；虽然这样，但我并没有悲观，我立时记得党平时教导我的话：“在共产党员面前没有克服不了的困难。”这句话的力量鼓舞着我，使我比先前更加刻苦努力。我成天就坐在炮盘上操作方向转轮，苦练自己的右臂，有时疼得钻心，但一咬牙就坚持下去了。耳朵听不见口令，我就让背后的三炮手用腿碰我的背作联系记号，脑袋疼就用力地靠在靠背上；这样苦练了一个时期，我又能很好地参加战斗了。
    自从出国作战以来，我部共击落敌机三十五架，击伤一百零二架，其中我和我的战友们共同击落六架，击伤十二架。我们有充分的把握在今后更严重地打击美国空中强盗，直到把它赶出朝鲜去！（附图片）
