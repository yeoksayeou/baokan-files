To the Editor:

The Shulan County Native Produce Company in Jilin Province accepted a task from a higher-level company last winter to purchase culled cattle (old, weak, disabled cattle unsuitable for continued plowing, for slaughter). However, without discrimination, they also purchased cattle capable of plowing. This September, the Agricultural Section of the County People's Government sent people to inspect the company and discovered that out of the 146 cattle purchased by the company, 84 were able-bodied work cattle. According to investigations, the company had already transported 310 cattle before the inspection, and it is impossible to determine how many of them were able-bodied cattle. This behavior of the company is completely illegal. Article 2 of the "Measures for Strictly Prohibiting the Indiscriminate Slaughter of Draught Animals" promulgated by the Northeast People's Government on March 31st of last year clearly states that draught animals and young draught animals that can be used for service or breeding are strictly prohibited from being slaughtered. Article 5 stipulates: "Merchants buying and selling draught animals must obtain the approval of the local government's agricultural and forestry departments after a thorough inspection before they can leave the area." However, from the time of purchasing the cattle until now, the company has never contacted the local government's agricultural department, nor has it conducted any inspection before privately transporting the cattle away. We hope that the company will immediately inspect and correct this erroneous behavior.

### 舒兰县土产公司违法收买耕牛应即检查纠正

    舒兰县土产公司违法收买耕牛应即检查纠正编辑同志：
    吉林舒兰县土产公司去冬接受上级公司分给收买废牛（老弱残废不堪继续耕作的牛，供屠宰用）的任务后，不分青红皂白，把能耕作的牛也收买了。今年九月县人民政府农业科派人往该公司检查，发现该公司收买的一百四十六头牛里，有八十四头是能劳动的耕牛。据调查，该公司在检查前已运出三百一十头牛，其中有多少是能劳动的牛已无法查出。该公司的这种行为是完全违法的。东北人民政府去年三月三十一日颁布“严禁滥行屠宰耕畜办法”中第二条说得很明白，可供使役或繁殖用的耕畜及未达使用年龄之幼小耕畜一律禁止屠宰。第五条规定：“商贩买卖耕畜，须经各该地政府农林部门切实检查准许后方得出境。”但该公司从购牛到现在，始终未与当地政府农业部门取得联系，又未经检查即私自运走。希望该公司对这种错误行为立即检查纠正。
