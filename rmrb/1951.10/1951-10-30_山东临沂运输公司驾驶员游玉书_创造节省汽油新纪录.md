    Shandong Linyi Transportation Company Driver You Yushu
    Creates New Fuel Efficiency Record
    You Yushu and Guo Zhongle, drivers from the motor vehicle squadron of the Shandong Linyi Transportation Branch Company, have created a new fuel efficiency record with the ten-wheel truck they drive. In September, the vehicle averaged 15.13 kilometers per gallon of gasoline, exceeding the standard by over six kilometers per gallon. As a result, they saved a total of 95.7 gallons of gasoline for the month, worth RMB 5,167,800 at the market price of 54,000 yuan per gallon.
    Comrades You Yushu and Guo Zhongle profoundly recognize the significant importance of saving gasoline in strengthening national defense. They constantly motivate themselves to save gasoline with the idea that "a drop of gasoline is a drop of blood," which is the main reason for their achievement. After receiving a freight transport assignment to Yanzhou and Pingyi in September, they tried to save gasoline in every possible way. They came up with ways to save gasoline from various aspects: First, they started with improving the machinery. Based on their work experience and careful research, they reduced the size of the oil needle eye on the carburetor to ensure a more even flow of oil; this is a good way to save gasoline. Second, they focused on improving their driving skills, with two methods: one is to maintain a consistent speed while driving, because fluctuating speeds waste gasoline; the other is to shift the gearbox to neutral when going downhill, which slows down the engine. When reaching level ground, they would then shift back into gear and accelerate, thus saving gasoline on downhill sections. In early October, they returned to the company and had the vehicle inspected by the repair shop, which found no damage to the engine.    (Ye Zhengxiu)

    山东临沂运输公司驾驶员游玉书
    创造节省汽油新纪录
    山东临沂运输分公司汽车中队驾驶员游玉书、助手郭忠乐两人所驾驶的十轮大卡车，创造了节省汽油的新纪录。该车九月份全月平均每加仑汽油行驶十五点一三公里，即每加仑汽油超过标准六公里。因此全月总计节省汽油达九五点七加仑。按市价每加仑五四、○○○元折算，共值人民币五、一六七、八○○元。
    游玉书、郭忠乐两同志深刻认识到节省汽油对于加强国防力量的重大意义，时刻以“一滴汽油一滴血”的思想督促自己节省汽油，是获得这种成绩的主要原因。他们在九月份接到至兖州、平邑一带运货任务后，处处设法节省汽油。他们节省汽油是从各方面来想办法的：首先是从改进机器着手。他们根据自己的工作经验，又经仔细研究，即将车上汽化器的油针眼改小，使流出的油量平均；这是节省汽油的好办法。其次是从提高驾驶技术着手，方法有两种：一种是在行驶中使车的速度均匀，因为车子忽快忽慢，就会浪费汽油；一种是在汽车下坡时，把变速箱拿到空挡上面，这样引擎转得慢，到平路时再上挡加油，因此节省了汽车下坡路上的汽油。十月上旬，他们回到公司，将车子交修理厂检查，发现机器一点也没有损坏。    （叶政修）
