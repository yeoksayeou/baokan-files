    China Coal Construction Company Suiyuan Branch
    Should Not Violate Labor Protection Laws
    To the Editor:
    The Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the China Coal Construction Company pays extremely little attention to the safety of life for its搬运 (bānyùn - carrying) workers. On July 2nd of this year,搬运 (bānyùn - carrying) worker Zhang Zhongdu suffered a minor abdominal injury when a large piece of wood rolled down and squeezed him while he was unloading lumber from a freight car. On July 30th, Zhang was struck in the abdomen again by lumber while working, because the wire binding the wood broke. Zhang was treated for ten days for his injuries, and medical expenses totaled more than 60,000 yuan, which the company completely ignored. On August 11th, cadres from the GuiSui City Labor Bureau and the City Federation of Trade Unions went to the company's coal yard to discuss the issue with Manager Hu. Manager Hu didn't care and told them to find Section Chief Fang. They then went to Section Chief Fang, who said, "Zhang Zhongdu is a worker who does loading and unloading for the company. We provide the money, and Zhang provides the labor. Please tell me from which item these expenses should be paid?"
    According to the instruction of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, anyone injured on the job should be reported to the local City Labor Bureau. However, after the City Labor Bureau sent the employee injury and death report form, the company ignored it. The company disregards government laws and deliberately shirks its responsibility. Relevant authorities should investigate the responsibility and take appropriate action.

    中国煤建公司绥远分公司
    不应违反劳动保护法令编辑同志：
    中国煤建公司绥远省分公司对搬运工人生命安全极不重视。今年七月二日，搬运工人张仲度从车皮上往下抬木料时，因大木料滚下挤中小腹受轻伤。七月三十日，张在工作时因捆木料的铁丝崩断，致又被木料打中小腹。张因伤疗养十天，医药费共花六万多元，公司完全不管。八月十一日，归绥市劳动局和市总工会派干部至该公司煤场与胡经理研究此问题，胡经理不管，要他们去找方股长。他们又去找方股长，方股长说：“张仲度是给公司干装卸活的工人，我们出的是钱，张出的是力。请你们指出，这些费用，从那一项目开支？”
    按中央财政经济委员会指示，凡因工负伤者，应报当地市劳动局。但当市劳动局发去职工伤亡报告表后；该公司并不理睬。该公司不顾政府法纪，故意推卸责任，有关机关应追究责任并作适当处理。
