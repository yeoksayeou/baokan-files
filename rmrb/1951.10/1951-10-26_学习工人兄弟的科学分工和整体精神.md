    Learning from the Scientific Division of Labor and Overall Spirit of the Worker Brothers
    Han En, Agricultural Labor Model of Jilin Province
    Before my visits to Beijing and Tianjin, I always thought that our mutual aid team in our village (Bao'an Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province) was quite good. Ninety percent of the villagers have already been organized, and we have a complete set of horse-drawn new-style farm implements. Production is increasing year by year, and living standards are rising year by year. But after visiting the factories and the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition, I realized that our agricultural production is still far from good enough. For example, although more than 90% of the people in our village have joined mutual aid teams, women are often delayed in production because of raising children. This problem has been going on for two or three years without a solution. This time, when we went from Beijing to Tianjin, the train we took was entirely managed by female comrades. I thought to myself: managing the train is a job that requires working on time, I wonder how they solve the problem of their children? When we arrived in Tianjin, we visited a textile factory, oh my! Almost all the workers there were women, and they also had many children. I asked them, "Who takes care of so many children for you?" The female worker comrades smiled and said, "Our children live a collective life just like we do." Then they led us to visit the factory's nursery. I saw hundreds of children in the nursery, eating so white and fat, living such a beautiful life. Children not only eat, sleep, and play on time, but even the amount they eat at one time is regulated. I was really moved. I thought: Putting all the children together saves labor and makes their lives beautiful. If our mutual aid team uses this method, it will not only free women from the fatigue of raising children and allow them to focus on production, but also cultivate organized and disciplined living habits in children from an early age.
    When we visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, I saw and felt the scientific division of labor and overall spirit of the worker elder brothers. Thinking back to our mutual aid team, there is really no comparison. We are divided into four major groups: a new-style farm implement group, a paddy field group, a dry land group, and a sideline business group. Sometimes the cooperation is not very good, mainly because our division of labor is not scientific and we do not have an overall thinking of producing more grain for the country. When I go back this time, I will also apply the scientific division of labor and overall thinking of the working class to our mutual aid team. At the same time, the production plans of the worker elder brothers are linked to the entire national production plan. Thinking back to our mutual aid team, although we have an annual plan every year, we still don't know how to combine it with the national production plan. When I go back this time, I will also educate the farmers in our village to broaden their horizons and be sure to combine our village's production plan with the national production plan.

    学习工人兄弟的科学分工和整体精神
    吉林省农业劳动模范  韩恩
    我这次没有来北京、天津参观以前，总认为我们村（吉林省蛟河县保安村）的互助组还算不错。全村百分之九十的人已经组织起来，也有了全套马拉新式农具，生产一年比一年提高，生活一年比一年上升。可是这次参观了工厂，又参观了华北区城乡物资交流展览会，才把我这个想法打消了。我认识到我们村的农业生产还做的很不够。比如我村虽然百分之九十以上的人都参加了互助组，可是妇女们常因抚养小孩耽误生产。这个问题闹了两三年都解决不了。这次从北京到天津去，我们坐的火车全是由女同志管理的。我当时想：管理火车是按时工作的，不知她们的小孩问题怎么解决？到了天津，我们参观了纺织厂，呵呀！那里的工人几乎全是妇女，她们的小孩子也很多，我问她们：“这么多小孩谁替你们照管？”女工同志笑着说：“我们的小孩也和我们一样，都过的是集体生活。”说着她们就领我们去参观工厂托儿所。我看到托儿所里有几百个小孩，吃的又白又胖，生活的实在美。小孩不光吃饭、睡觉、玩耍都按时间，连一次吃多少都有规定，我看了实在感动。我想：把小孩都放到一块，既省工，小孩生活又美。我们互助组如果用上这办法，不光能把妇女们从抚养孩子的劳累里解放出来安心生产，还能把小孩从小就养成有组织有纪律的生活习惯。
    当我们参观石景山钢铁厂时，我看到了和体会到了工人老大哥的科学分工和整体精神。回想到我们的互助组，实在不能相比。我们总共分新式农具组、水田组、旱田组、副业组四大组，有时还配合的不好，主要就是因为我们分工不科学和没有一个为国家生产更多粮食的整体思想。这次回去也要把工人阶级的科学分工和整体思想运用到我们的互助组里去。同时，工人老大哥的生产计划是和整个国家生产计划联系着的。回想起我们互助组来，虽然每年有一个一年计划，但还不知道怎么和国家的生产计划结合起来。这次回去也要教育我村农民把眼光放远些，一定要把我们村的生产计划和国家生产计划结合起来。
