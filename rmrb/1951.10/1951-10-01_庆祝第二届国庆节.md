    Celebrating the Second National Day
    Li Jishen
    We celebrate the second National Day with a hundredfold of ardent, joyful, excited, and inspired feelings.
    The new China has truly become a great family of friendly cooperation among all fraternal nationalities, something unprecedented in history. First of all, we would like to extend our highest respects to the great people's leader Chairman Mao, who founded the country!
    We warmly celebrate the peaceful liberation of Tibet and extend our highest respects to the meritorious individuals of both the Chinese and Tibetan nationalities who have worked for the peaceful liberation of Tibet!
    We are grateful for the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party before and after the founding of the country, which annihilated 8.07 million of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, liberated the entire Chinese territory except Taiwan, and realized the true unity of the Chinese people. We pay our respects and best wishes to the combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army!
    We are equally grateful to the incomparably brave Chinese People's Volunteers, who, together with the Korean People's Army, have resisted the aggression of American imperialism in Korea for the past year, creating five victories of glorious achievement, defending our borders, and displaying a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. We pay our respects and best wishes to the combat heroes of the Volunteers!
    As we celebrate National Day, we are even more grateful to the martyrs and heroes who sacrificed themselves for the people's liberation war and the war to resist America and aid Korea! Immortal glory to the great and glorious martyrs and heroes!
    In the two years since the founding of the country, our people's democratic regime has been as solid as Mount Tai. We have established diplomatic relations with twenty-five countries, including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, North Korea, Vietnam, India, Burma, and Indonesia, or are in the process of establishing them. In particular, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed in Moscow on February 14th last year (1950) is a guarantee of peace in Asia and the greatest help the Soviet Union has given us to achieve prosperity and strength. Today we should pay our respects to Marshal Stalin!
    The establishment of people's governments at all levels and the system of people's representative conferences at all levels are the greatest achievements in domestic affairs in the past two years. Twenty-eight provinces and eight administrative regions across the country have held people's representative conferences, and 144 cities and 2,115 county-level administrative units have held people's representative conferences or people's congresses. Representatives include people from all nationalities, all democratic classes, and all walks of life, absorbing the opinions of the broad masses of the people and gradually expanding the work of the united front. The people universally reflect: "The People's Government works for us, reports accounts to us, and the government does what we decide. The people are truly masters of their own affairs." At the same time, the formulation and promulgation of the Marriage Law have liberated half of the total population of China, women who have suffered from cruel feudal oppression for thousands of years.
    On such a solid foundation, the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the country, resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and thoroughly carrying out land reform have been launched in the past two years. This is a fierce struggle against imperialism and feudalism; a great movement of the whole Chinese people, vigorous and flourishing. In the anti-American and aid-Korea movement, the volunteer soldiers at the front have demonstrated unparalleled bravery, selfless sacrifice, and amazing wisdom. In the rear, the people of the whole country are doing their best to support them with one heart. On November 4th last year, the democratic parties headed by the Communist Party issued a joint declaration of justice against the aggression of American imperialism. This year, the number of people participating in patriotic demonstrations and parades on and before May 1st reached more than 239 million. The number of people who signed the declaration on the Five Great Powers concluding a peace pact across the country reached more than 344 million, and the number of people who voted against the United States arming Japan reached more than 339 million. As of September 21st, the weapons donated by the people across the country reached 2,481 aircraft alone. The unprecedented rise in the political awareness of the people across the country has strengthened the foundation for victory in resisting America and aiding Korea. The counter-revolutionary elements of American imperialism and the reactionaries secretly carried out sabotage, which was rampant for a time last year. After mobilizing the masses to suppress them with great fanfare, by the first half of this year, special agents, bandit leaders, local tyrants, heads of reactionary sects, habitual bandits, etc., have been basically eliminated. More than 80% of the people across the country have participated in the movement to accuse or report counter-revolutionary elements. Regarding land reform, the Central People's Government promulgated the Land Reform Law at the end of June last year, and then the newly liberated areas of the four major administrative regions of East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest carried out the land reform movement. By May of this year, land reform had been completed in areas with a total agricultural population of more than 150 million. Together with the areas already completed in the old areas, land reform has been completed in areas with an agricultural population of more than 310 million across the country. In the past year, about 150 million mu of land have been confiscated and requisitioned, and 90 million farmers have been allocated land. The rural areas after land reform have been completely renewed, and the farmers have truly turned over and become masters of their own affairs.
    The achievements in economic construction, production, and disaster relief in the past two years are also unprecedented. The biggest scourge left by the reactionaries, the constantly rising prices for twelve years, was stopped within half a year of the founding of the country. It has remained basically stable until now—one year into the movement to resist America and aid Korea. China's Huai River has always caused considerable disasters, and no dynasty has ever cured it. When the disaster occurred last year, in addition to the government's vigorous disaster relief and the allocation of 2.6 billion jin of grain, Chairman Mao decided to cure the Huai River and issued the call to "be sure to fix the Huai River." Starting from the winter of last year, three million migrant workers, technicians, experts, engineers, etc., were mobilized under organized and planned leadership, and the first year's great project was completed in about eight months by July of this year. There was no disaster in the area where the project was completed this autumn, and the wheat fields had a bumper harvest. The people in the Huai River basin therefore concluded that "without the Communist Party, the Huai River cannot be cured." In the past two years, there have been amazing achievements in industrial and agricultural production, railway transportation, and market trade. The output of coal, steel, gasoline, cement, etc., has increased year by year. The output of gauze last year has exceeded the highest year of production before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and this year it will be even higher. The increase in grain production can be seen from the fact that imports of foreign grain were stopped last year, and a considerable amount of grain was exported this year. This year's cotton production will also have a bumper harvest that will break historical records. In terms of railways, the mileage of railways opened to traffic last year reached more than 22,000 kilometers. The Sichuan people struggled and shed blood for forty years before liberation without achieving the desired Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Now 200 kilometers have been built, and the Chongqing-Yongchuan section has been officially opened to traffic since September 1 this year. The construction of the railway from Liuzhou to Zhennanguan via Nanning, and the construction of the Tianlan and Laizhen railways have also successfully completed the planned projects. Markets across the country have improved year by year, and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has gradually expanded. Foreign trade last year showed a surplus; this broke the situation of continuous deficits in the 73 years since 1877. With the great achievements described above, the lives of the people across the country have gradually stabilized and gradually improved; currently, there is a scene of prosperity across the country. Therefore, we are even more excited and joyful as we celebrate National Day today!
    While we warmly, joyfully, excitedly, and inspiringly celebrate National Day, we should be even more aware that the imperialist group headed by the United States, under the pressure of the increasingly strong forces of world peace and democracy, is carrying out its aggressive conspiracies in the East and the West. The so-called "peace treaty with Japan" and "US-Japan Security Treaty" manipulated and signed by American imperialism are precisely the fuses for arranging to step up aggression against Korea and then against China and even the entire Asia. This and the so-called "North Atlantic Treaty" and "the plan to arm West Germany" are mutually responsive and coordinated in the East and the West. This is clearly an open operational plan for a war of aggression. In order to defend our revolutionary achievements, maintain our happy lives, maintain economic and cultural construction to reach a socialist society, and for world peace, we must accelerate the crushing of all kinds of conspiracies and actions of the imperialist group. Therefore, our primary and central task must be to strengthen national defense, accelerate the over-fulfillment of weapon donations, and do a good job in preferential treatment; we must always be vigilant and guard against the activities of counter-revolutionary elements; we must strive to participate in land reform and complete the task early; we must work hard to increase production and enrich the strength of economic construction; we must strengthen the united front, step up the work of establishing political power, and further unite the people of all strata; everyone must serve wholeheartedly in their work positions and cultivate a stronger national strength; we must strengthen our support for the Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship and unite all people's democratic countries as well as the countries and people in Asia who are fighting against imperialism and all peace-loving people in the world to expand the strength and momentum of the peace and democracy camp. Only in this way will our celebration of National Day today have more practical and vivid significance; and only then can we exert a huge and unparalleled force!
    Long live the great People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the great Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao!

    庆祝第二届国庆节
    李济深
    我们以百倍热烈、愉快、兴奋、鼓舞的心情庆祝第二届国庆节。
    新中国已经真正成为各兄弟民族友好合作的大家庭，这是亘古以来所未有的。首先我们要向开国的伟大人民领袖毛主席致最崇高的敬礼！
    我们热烈庆祝西藏的和平解放，并向中藏两族为和平解放西藏而努力的功臣们致崇高的敬礼！
    我们感念中国共产党领导下的中国人民解放军在开国前后的英勇战斗，消灭了蒋介石匪军八百零七万，解放了除台湾以外的全中国领土，实现了中国人民真正的统一。我们要向人民解放军的战斗英雄们致敬致祝！
    我们同样感念英勇无比的中国人民志愿军一年来在朝鲜和朝鲜人民军共同抵抗美帝国主义的侵略，造成五次胜利的光辉战绩；保卫了我们的边疆，发挥了高度爱国主义和国际主义的精神。我们向志愿军的战斗英雄们致敬致祝！
    我们庆祝国庆，更感念为人民解放战争和抗美援朝战争而牺牲的烈士英雄们！伟大光荣的烈士英雄们永垂不朽！
    开国两年来，我们的人民民主政权已固如泰山。我们已和苏联及保、罗、匈、捷克、波兰、朝鲜、越南、印度、缅甸、印尼等二十五个国家建立了外交关系或正在建立外交关系。尤其是去年（一九五○）二月十四日在莫斯科签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，是亚洲和平的保障，是苏联给予我们走向繁荣富强的最大帮助。我们今天应该向斯大林大元帅致敬！
    建立各级人民政权和建立各级人民代表会议的制度是两年来内政方面最大的成绩。全国已有二十八个省和八个行署区开过了各界人民代表会议，一百四十四个市和二千一百一十五个县行政单位开过各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会；代表包括各民族、各民主阶层和各界的人士，吸取广大人民的意见，逐渐扩大了统一战线的工作。人民普遍地反映：“人民政府给我们办事，向我们报帐，我们决定了政府就办，人民真是当家作主了。”同时，婚姻法的制定与公布，使数千年来受残酷的封建压迫的全中国人口半数的妇女获得了解放。
    在这样巩固的基础上，两年来展开了抗美援朝保家卫国、坚决镇压反革命和彻底进行土地改革三大运动。这是反帝反封建的激烈斗争；是全中国人民轰轰烈烈蓬蓬勃勃的伟大运动。抗美援朝运动在前线有志愿军战士们表现无比的英勇、忘我的牺牲和惊人的智慧；在后方有全国人民竭力同心地支持。以共产党为首的各民主党派去年十一月四日发出正义的联合宣言，反对美帝国主义的侵略。今年“五一”和“五一”以前各地参加爱国示威游行的人数达到二亿三千九百多万人。全国在关于五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签名的人数有三亿四千四百多万人，投票反对美国武装日本的人数有三亿三千九百多万人。全国各地认捐的武器截至九月二十一日止，仅飞机一项已达二千四百八十一架。全国人民政治觉悟的空前高涨，加强了抗美援朝胜利的基础。美帝国主义和反动派的反革命分子暗中进行破坏，去年一度猖獗。经发动群众大张旗鼓予以镇压，今年上半年为止，已将特务、匪首、恶霸、反动道门头子、惯匪等基本肃清。全国百分之八十以上的人民都参加了控诉或检举反革命分子的运动。关于土地改革，去年六月底中央人民政府公布了土地改革法，接着华东、中南、西南、西北四大行政区的新解放区就进行土地改革运动；今年五月止共有一亿五千多万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革。连同老区已经完成的地区，全国已有三亿一千多万农业人口地区完成了土地改革。一年来没收和征收的土地约为一亿五千万亩，已有九千万农民分得了土地。土地改革后的农村面貌完全一新，农民真是人人翻身了。
    两年来经济建设、生产救灾等方面工作的成就更是史无前例的。反动派留下最大的祸害，十二年不断上涨的物价，开国半年内就把它停止下来。一直到现在——抗美援朝运动进行到一年的现在，基本上仍保持稳定。我国的淮河从来造成相当的灾害，历代从来没有治好。去年灾情发生，除了政府大力救灾，拨发粮食二十六亿斤外，毛主席决定根治淮河，并发出“一定要把淮河修好”的号召，从去年冬季起三百万民工、技工、专家、工程师等在有组织有计划的领导下动员起来，到今年七月约八个月的时间内完成了第一年的伟大工程。今秋工程完成的区域就没有灾害，麦田获得丰收。淮河流域的人民因此作出结论“没有共产党，淮河治不好”。两年中工农业生产、铁路交通、市场贸易各方面都有惊人的成绩，煤炭、钢铁、汽油、水泥等产量一年比一年增加。纱布产量去年已超过抗战前产量最高的一年，今年更将提高。粮食的增产可以从去年停止外粮的进口，达到今年输出相当的粮食。棉花产量今年也将有打破历史纪录的丰收。铁路方面去年通车里程达到二万二千多公里。四川人民在解放前四十年中奋斗流血没有达到要求的成渝铁路，现已修通了二百公里，重庆到永川一段今年九月一日起已经正式通车。从柳州经南宁到镇南关的铁路，天兰、来镇两路的修筑，也都胜利完成了预定的计划工程。全国各地市场一年比一年好转，城乡物资交流逐渐广泛地展开。对外贸易去年出现了出超的数额；这打破了一八七七年以后七十三年中一直入超的局面。有了以上所述的巨大成就，全国人民的生活才渐渐地安定，渐渐地改善；目前全国各地都是一片兴隆繁荣的气象。因此我们今天庆祝国庆，就更觉得百倍的兴奋，百倍的愉快！
    我们热烈、愉快、兴奋、鼓舞地庆祝国庆之余，更应明白以美国为首的帝国主义集团，在世界和平民主力量日益壮大的压力之下，正在东方和西方肆其侵略阴谋。美帝国主义操纵画押的所谓“对日和约”和“美日安全条约”，正是布置加紧侵略朝鲜，进而侵略中国乃至全亚洲的火药线。这和所谓“北大西洋公约”“武装西德的计划”等等是互相策应，东西配合的。这显然是公开的一个侵略战争的作战计划。我们为首保卫革命果实，保持幸福生活，保持进行经济文化的建设达到社会主义社会，为着世界和平，就必须加速粉碎帝国主义集团的各种阴谋与行动。因此，我们首要而中心的任务必须是加强国防，加速超额完成武器捐献，做好优抚工作；必须随时提高警惕，防范反革命分子的活动；必须争取参加土地改革，早期完成任务；必须努力增产，充实经济建设的力量；必须加强统一战线，加紧建立政权的工作，更进一步团结各阶层的民众；必须人人在工作岗位上全心全意地服务，养成更强大的国力；必须加强拥护中苏友好同盟和团结各人民民主国家以及亚洲反帝斗争中的国家和人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，扩大和平民主阵营的力量和声势。这样我们今天庆祝国庆，才更有实际生动的意义；才更发挥巨大无比的力量！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
