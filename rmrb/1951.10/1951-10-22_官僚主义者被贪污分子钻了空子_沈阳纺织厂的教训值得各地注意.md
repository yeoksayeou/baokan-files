    Bureaucrats Exploited by Corrupt Elements
    Lessons from the Shenyang Textile Factory Deserve Attention Nationwide

    The former director and deputy director of the Northeast Shenyang No. 8 Textile Factory, Communist Party members Sun Bo and Zhang Zhengwen, due to serious bureaucratic work styles, allowed corrupt elements such as Kang Shensan to take advantage and steal state materials, causing enormous losses to state property.
    During their tenure as factory directors, Sun Bo and Zhang Zhengwen lacked the mindset of relying on the working class to manage the factory, and they did not have strict economic inspection systems. As a result, a small number of retained personnel with deep-rooted bad habits from the old society, such as Kang Shensan (former head of the personnel and wages section; this criminal died of pulmonary tuberculosis while in custody despite medical treatment), Lu Xingzhou (former head of the business section), and Wang Xiufeng (former head of the supply section), colluded with the unscrupulous merchant Yao Zizheng and conspired with more than 20 section chiefs, stock chiefs, accountants, warehouse managers, and team leaders within the factory to engage in collective embezzlement. They sold the factory's waste cotton and miscellaneous goods at low prices, and took advantage of these sales to steal over 34,000 catties of raw cotton in large quantities. To cover up the crime of stealing national assets, the warehouse keepers deliberately muddled the inventory records. From 1949 to November 1950, there were 37 documented instances of them stealing state property. The resulting loss to the state amounted to over 11.9 billion yuan (Northeast currency). Sun Bo and others were unaware of this serious situation for a long time. The masses had reported them, but they blindly trusted Kang Shensan and others, allowing the corrupt elements to continue their corrupt activities. The production enthusiasm of the entire factory was affected, and production tasks were often not completed.
    At the end of last year, after receiving reports from the masses regarding this issue, the Shenyang Municipal People's Court of Northeast China immediately detained the main culprits of embezzlement, Wang Xiufeng, Lu Xingzhou, and Yao Zizheng. After a long and careful trial, on September 25th of this year, the three criminals were sentenced to death. Accomplices Lin Youren, Xu Guishen, and 13 others were sentenced to imprisonment. Those with minor offenses who confessed and repented were treated leniently.
    At the same time, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made a stern criticism of the bureaucratic work styles of Sun Bo and Zhang Zhengwen. Given that Sun Bo, as the factory director appointed by the state, abandoned his due responsibilities for state property, causing undue losses to the state, it was decided to give him a public warning within the Party. It was also recommended that he be given a major demerit in administrative terms. As the deputy factory director, the secretary of the Party branch, and the direct person in charge of financial management, Zhang Zhengwen gave out the most approval slips to private merchants, had serious bureaucratic and individualistic tendencies, often haggled over personal rights, created disunity among cadres, and was numb to corrupt elements, failing to investigate even when doubts arose. This led to such a major embezzlement case, which was a serious political error. It was decided to give him a public warning and recommend that he be removed from his post administratively.

    官僚主义者被贪污分子钻了空子
    沈阳纺织厂的教训值得各地注意
    东北沈阳纺织第八厂前任正副厂长、共产党员孙波、张正文因存在着严重的官僚主义作风，致被贪污分子康省三等乘隙盗卖国家物资，使国家财产遭到巨大损失。
    孙波、张正文任厂长期间，既缺乏依靠工人阶级管理工厂的思想，又没有严格的经济检查制度，因而少数旧社会恶习很深的留用人员，如康省三（前任人事工资科长。该犯因长期患肺结核，在被扣押期间医治无效，病死）、鲁兴洲（前任经理科长）、王秀峰（前任供给科长）便乘隙勾结奸商么子正，串通了厂内部分科长、股长、会计和仓库管理员、班长等共二十多人，进行集体贪污。他们低价出卖工厂废棉、杂品，并乘出卖废品时，大批盗卖原棉三万四千余斤。管库员为掩盖这盗卖国家资财的罪行，则故意把出库入库帐目弄乱。自一九四九年至一九五○年十一月，有据可查者，他们共盗窃国家财产三十七次之多。国家因此所受的损失达一百一十九亿余元（东北币）之巨。对于这样严重的情况，孙波等竟长期没有察觉。当时群众曾向他们告发，但他们却对康省三等一味盲目信任，致使贪污分子得以继续进行贪污活动。全厂职工生产情绪则因此受到影响，生产任务常常不能完成。
    去年底，东北沈阳市人民法院接获群众对此问题的检举后，即将贪污主犯王秀峰、鲁兴洲、么子正等三人拘押，经长期慎重审理，于今年九月二十五日将该三犯判处极刑。从犯林友仁、徐桂深等十三人判处徒刑，对情节较轻并坦白改悔者则已从宽处理。
    同时中共沈阳市委纪律检查委员会对孙波、张正文二人的官僚主义作风，作了严正的批评。鉴于孙波是国家委派的厂长，放弃对国家财产应尽的职责，造成了国家不应有的损失，决定党内给予当众警告的处分。并建议行政上给予记大过一次的处分。副厂长张正文是党的支部书记，又是财务管理的直接负责人，给私商批条子也最多，有严重的官僚主义和个人英雄主义，常计较个人权利，弄得干部间不团结，而对贪污分子则麻木不仁，发现疑问也不追究，致造成如此重大的贪污事件，这是政治上的严重错误，决定给予当众警告处分，并建议行政上撤销工作。
