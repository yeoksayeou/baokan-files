Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th – Special correspondent report: After the liaison officers of both sides met at the Panmunjom meeting site at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, they immediately went to the scene to continue investigating the serious incident of U.S. military aircraft strafing the neutral zone on the afternoon of the 12th. The liaison officers of both sides first went to the scene near the Panmunjom meeting area for review, and then went to the strafing location five kilometers northwest of Kaesong for investigation. The investigation at the two locations and the travel time took a total of three hours. More than 30 bullet marks were found at the scene near Panmunjom. In addition to reviewing the location where Korean child Jiang Yongdun was killed, several bullet marks were also inspected in the rice fields on the left side of the Kaesong-Panmunjom highway. The other party's liaison officer personally dug out several half-inch caliber armor-piercing bullet heads from the bullet marks, and the points of impact were all from northwest to southeast. The liaison officers of both sides also visited the families of the victims Jiang Daxing and Jiang Yongyun, as well as local farmer Park Xieyang. The interviewees unanimously confirmed that the three aircraft that strafed yesterday were U.S. military aircraft, and stated that the shape of the aircraft was the F-80 jet fighter. Another strafing location was the 227.7 Highland five kilometers northwest of Kaesong. U.S. aircraft used the abandoned fortifications on the highland as targets for strafing. Bullet marks were distributed inside and outside the fortification trenches and on the top. According to preliminary understanding, there were about 140 bullet marks. The bullet heads taken out by the other party's liaison officer from the bullet marks were the same as those dug out from the scene near Panmunjom, which were half-inch caliber armor-piercing bullets fired by machine guns only equipped on U.S. aircraft. After inspecting the scene, the liaison officers of both sides went to Qilin Village at the foot of the mountain to interview local residents about the U.S. aircraft strafing situation on the 12th. Wang Laoshun, a woman from the village, and Wang Chengchao, a 14-year-old boy, gave accurate explanations of the number of U.S. aircraft, the strafing time, and the type of aircraft, proving that the three aircraft that strafed the 227.7 Highland in the evening of the 12th were U.S. jet fighters.

    The entire investigation process proves that the strafing incident that occurred in the Kaesong neutral zone and near the Panmunjom meeting site during the day on the 12th was another serious violation of the Kaesong neutralization agreement by U.S. aircraft, and it was openly carried out twice in a row during the day. Obviously, the responsibility cannot be evaded by claiming it was an accidental misfire. In the past three days, the liaison officers of both sides had reached an agreement on the necessary matters for resuming the meeting, but the negotiation meeting could not be quickly resumed because the other party's liaison officer insisted on discussing other issues that could be resolved at the representative meeting. The occurrence of this strafing incident clearly shows that the U.S. side, regardless of our efforts, continues to delay and obstruct the resumption of negotiations. This investigation ended after the other party's liaison officer considered it fully satisfactory. According to reporters, our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, issued a solemn statement after the investigation, pointing out that this strafing incident has been completely determined to be the responsibility of the U.S. side based on the testimony of witnesses and material evidence in the investigation. Colonel Zhang was once again ordered to lodge our protest to the U.S. side and demand that the other party handle this incident quickly and responsibly. Colonel Zhang also suggested that the liaison officer meeting originally scheduled for the 13th be postponed to the 14th, so that both sides could report the results of this investigation to their superiors and handle this incident quickly and responsibly, so that this incident would not become an obstacle to the liaison officer meeting. The other party's chief liaison officer, Delo, stated that a full investigation had been conducted into the strafing incident in the neutral zone and that he would report the results of the investigation to his superiors responsibly. Both sides agreed to postpone the liaison officer meeting to discuss the resumption of negotiations to 10:00 a.m. on the 14th.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th – Special correspondent report: At 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, the liaison officers of both sides conducted a review at the strafing site near the Panmunjom meeting site.

    When the investigating officials and reporters approached the scene along the road, Jiang Daxing, the father of the victimized child Jiang Yongdun, was already waiting there, his face full of grief and anger. The victim's brother, Jiang Yongyun, a teenager who was catching fish in the stream when the incident occurred on the 12th, stood silently beside his father. The mother stood there silently facing the stream, with a two-year-old child on her back. One of the child's small hands was bandaged in white, extending outside the blood-stained sleeve. This is a family of victims. How many peaceful towns and villages in Korea are destroyed by U.S. aircraft bombing and strafing every day, and how many women and children are massacred? And here, in the Kaesong neutral zone, about 1,000 meters west of the new site of the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom, the American murderers massacred a twelve-year-old child again on the 12th.

    Beside a small stream on the left side of the road, and on the slope from the road to the stream, there are many bright red blood stains. By the stream, Jiang Yongdun was still lying there with his chest exposed on the evening of the 12th. Today, the family has moved his body back home. Now a stone is left here, with particularly clear blood stains on it.

    Standing here and looking at these blood stains, the hearts of the Korean-Chinese investigators and reporters are heavy, and their faces are filled with grief and indignation.

    The other party's liaison officer, Delo, asked the victim's family the same questions he had asked on the evening of the 12th. He asked Jiang Yongyun what the plane that strafed yesterday looked like. Jiang Yongyun squatted down and drew a picture of an airplane on the ground with his finger. What this child drew was none other than the F-80 jet fighter with fuel tanks hanging under its wings. Delo asked his translator to draw two types of airplanes: one was an F-80, and the other was a different type of airplane, and asked him which one it was. He pointed to the former and said: It was this kind of American airplane. Delo, this Air Force colonel, naturally knew very well about American airplanes, but he wanted a child to know, like him, whether there were holes next to the airplane's head? The child's father could not help but get angry. He excitedly asked the American colonel: "What holes or no holes, your airplane killed someone, and you still want us to look at whether the airplane has holes!?"

    On the evening of the 12th, Jiang Daxing had already asked Delo what to do about his son being killed. Today, he followed this American colonel closely, determined to get a satisfactory answer. He put his hands on his hips and questioned: "Now the North and the South are meeting (referring to the armistice negotiations), why did you come to strafe the neutral zone, killing and wounding my son? Now you come to investigate, you must bring my son back to life before we let you go." This is a righteous protest, this is the voice of all peace-loving people in the world. Delo seemed to realize that something was wrong and slipped away, leaving his Korean translator to repeatedly explain: "I am the translator, I cannot answer your question..." appearing very embarrassed.

    When Delo was about to get into the jeep, this angry Korean old man grabbed his clothes again, demanding that he explain what to do. This is the profound hatred of the Korean people towards American imperialism. People all over the world are sending a voice to the American generals: If you have the sincerity to end the bloodshed in Korea, you should quickly and responsibly handle the bloody shooting incident on October 12.

    美方显然继续阻挠恢复谈判
    全部复查过程证明是美机扫射中立区
    我方联络官再次奉命向美方提出抗议
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者报道：双方联络官于十三日晨九时在板门店会场晤面后，立即同赴现场继续调查十二日下午美方军用飞机扫射中立区的严重事件。双方联络官首赴板门店会场区附近的现场进行复查，继赴开城西北五公里的被扫射地点调查。赴两地调查及行车时间共历时三小时，在板门店附近现场又发现弹痕三十余处。除复查了朝鲜儿童姜永敦死难地点外，又在开城通板门店公路的左侧稻田里察勘了数处弹痕。对方联络官亲自从弹痕中挖出半英寸口径的穿甲弹弹头数枚，弹着点均由西北向东南。双方联络官又访问了受难者家属姜大兴、姜永运及当地的农民朴燮阳，被访问者异口同词证明昨日扫射的三架飞机是美方军用飞机，并说明了该飞机的形状即为F—八十型喷气式战斗机。另一被扫射地点位于开城西北五公里的二二七·七高地，美方飞机以高地上的废弃工事为目标进行扫射，弹痕分布于工事交通壕内外及顶端，据初步了解约有弹痕一百四十余处。对方联络官从弹痕中取出的弹头与板门店附近现场挖出的相同，是只有美方飞机才装有的机关枪发射的半英寸口径的穿甲弹。双方联络官在现场察勘后，同赴山下七邻洞，向当地居民访问十二日美机扫射情况。该村妇女王老顺及十四岁的男孩王成朝对美机架次、扫射时间及飞机类型作了确切的说明，证明十二日傍晚时扫射二二七·七高地的三架飞机是美国的喷气式战斗机。
    从全部调查过程证明：十二日白昼在开城中立区及板门店会场附近发生的扫射事件，乃系美方飞机又一次对开城中立化协议的严重破坏，而且是公然在白昼连续进行两次扫射，显然不能藉口为偶发的误射事件而逃避责任。最近三日来，双方联络官曾就复会必要的事宜得到协议，但由于对方联络官在会议上坚持讨论其他可以放在代表会议上解决的问题而使谈判会议不能迅速恢复。此次扫射事件的发生，显然是美方不顾我方的努力，继续拖延与阻挠谈判的恢复。此次调查，在对方联络官认为充分满意之后结束。据记者获悉：我方联络官张春山上校在调查结束后曾发表郑重声明，指出这次扫射事件从调查中的人证和物证，已经完全确定了系美方的责任。张上校再次奉命向美方提出我方的抗议，并要求对方对此次事件作迅速负责的处理。张上校并建议将原定在十三日举行的联络官会议延期到十四日举行，以便双方将这次事件的调查结果向上级报告，并对这次事件作迅速负责的处理，使这次事件不致成为联络官会议进行的障碍。对方首席联络官戴罗表示此次扫射中立区事件已有了充分调查，他将把调查结果向上级作负责报告。双方同意将讨论恢复谈判事宜的联络官会议延期至十四日上午十时继续举行。
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者报道：十三日早晨九时，双方联络官在板门店会场附近的被扫射地点进行了复查。
    当调查官员及记者们沿着公路走近现场的时候，被难儿童姜永敦的父亲姜大兴早已守候在那里，他的脸色充满着悲痛与愤怒。被难者的哥哥姜永运，一个在十二日发生事情时在溪水里捉鱼的少年，默默地站在父亲的身边。母亲则面向着小溪也一言不发地站在那里，她背上背着一个两岁的孩子，孩子的一只小手扎着白色绷带，伸在染满血迹的小袖外面，这是一个被难者的家庭。在朝鲜每天有多少和平城乡被美机炸射而毁灭着，又有多少妇女和儿童被屠杀着，而在这里，在开城中立区内停战谈判新会址的板门店以西约一千米的地方，美国凶手们又在十二日屠杀了一个十二岁的儿童。
    在公路左侧的一条小溪边，和从公路到溪边的坡上，有着许多鲜红的血迹。在溪水边，十二日晚上姜永敦还敞开着胸仰躺在那里，今天家属们已经把他的遗体搬回家去了。现在在这里留下了一块石头，上面的血迹特别鲜明。
    站在这里望着这些血迹，朝中方面的调查人员和记者们心头是沉痛的，脸色是悲愤的。
    对方联络官戴罗在这里又向被难者家属提出了十二日晚上已经问过的问题，他问姜永运昨天扫射的飞机是什么样子的？姜永运蹲下来，用手指在地面画了一个飞机的样子。这孩子画的不是别的，正是在机翼下挂着汽油箱的F—八十型喷气式战斗机。戴罗要他的翻译官画两架飞机的式样：一架是F—八十式的飞机，一架是其他样子的飞机，问他是那一种？他指着前者并且说：就是这样的美国飞机。戴罗这个空军上校对于美国的飞机自然是知道得清清楚楚的，但是他却要一个孩子像他一样，知道飞机头旁边有没有窟窿？孩子的父亲已经忍不住气，他激动地问美国的上校：“什么窟窿不窟窿，你们的飞机杀了人还要我们看看飞机有没有洞洞！？”
    十二日晚上姜大兴已经问戴罗打死了他的儿子究竟怎么办？今天他紧紧地跟着这个美国上校，一定要得到一个满意的答复。他把双手往腰间一插责问说：“现在南北在开会（即指停战谈判），你们为什么要来扫射中立区，把我的儿子打死、打伤了？现在你们来调查，一定要把我儿子弄活了才让你们走。”这是正义的抗议，这是全世界一切爱好和平人民的声音。戴罗看样子不对，偷偷溜到一边去，弄得他的朝鲜语翻译官连连解说：“我是翻译官，我不能答复你的问题……”显得很尴尬的样子。
    当戴罗要走上吉普的时候，这位愤怒的朝鲜老人又一把拉住他的衣襟，要他讲清楚究竟怎么办。这就是朝鲜人民对美帝国主义所表示的深刻仇恨。全世界的人民都在向美国的将军们发出一个声音：如果你们还有结束朝鲜流血冲突的诚意，你们就应当迅速而负责地处理十月十二日射扫的流血事件。
