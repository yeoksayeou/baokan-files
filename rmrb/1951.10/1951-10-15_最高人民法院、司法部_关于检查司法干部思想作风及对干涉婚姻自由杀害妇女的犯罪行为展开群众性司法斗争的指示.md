In implementing the State Council's instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, people's judicial organs at all levels must earnestly and resolutely wage a mass judicial struggle against the remnants of the feudal marriage system and criminal acts of interfering with freedom of marriage and harming women. To achieve this goal, people's courts at all levels should immediately conduct retrials of cases involving injury, abuse, or murder of women, or forcing women to commit suicide due to marriage issues, if the judgments have been finalized but contain errors and meet the conditions for retrial. Cases that have not yet been finalized should be promptly handled in accordance with the law, ensuring that every offender receives the punishment they deserve.

At the same time, people's judicial organs at all levels should organize a thorough inspection of the ideological style of judicial cadres in handling marriage cases. Cadres who correctly and actively implement and promote the Marriage Law should be commended. Cadres who delay, perfunctorily handle, forcibly mediate, lightly sentence serious crimes, or even make illegal judgments in handling marriage cases must be held accountable. The ideological reasons for their errors and the harm their errors have caused or may cause to the people must be pointed out. They must be ordered to conduct strict self-criticism and rectification. Individual cadres with serious dereliction of duty must be given appropriate punishment. The results of the inspection should be announced to the masses and cadres in an appropriate manner to educate the masses and cadres and to enforce discipline. Judicial organs at all levels should pay attention to the exposure of errors in handling marriage cases in the People's Daily and local newspapers. The relevant judicial organs must promptly conduct inspections, provide responsible answers to the newspapers, and report to us.

In addition, in order to vigorously wage a judicial struggle against criminal acts of interfering with freedom of marriage and murdering women, people's courts at all levels should, after clarifying the facts through trial and making thorough preparations, convene public trials for cases with significant educational value. This will combine the punishment of crimes with inspiring the masses' self-education and preventing crimes, and with the mass movement to oppose feudalism and the remnants of its marriage system. The Supreme People's Court branches and the Provincial (Municipal) People's Courts may select typical cases within their respective regions or provinces and conduct demonstrative trials through referral or on-site trials to promote the comprehensive and vigorous implementation of the State Council's instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law.

    关于检查司法干部思想作风及对干涉婚姻自由杀害妇女的犯罪行为展开群众性司法斗争的指示
    各级人民司法机关在执行政务院关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示中，必须认真地坚决地向封建婚姻制度的遗毒及干涉婚姻自由残害妇女的犯罪行为，进行群众性的司法斗争。为了达到此目的，各级人民审判机关对于因婚姻问题伤害、虐杀妇女或逼致妇女自杀的案件，凡已判决确定者，如有错误而合于再审的条件，应即进行再审。其尚未判决确定者，应即迅速依法处理，务使每个犯罪者都受到应有的惩罚。
    同时，各级人民司法机关应就司法干部中处理婚姻案件的思想作风，组织一次切实的检查。对于正确地积极地执行婚姻法与宣传婚姻法的干部，应给以表扬；对于处理婚姻案件有拖延不决、草率敷衍、强制调解、重罪轻判甚至违法裁判等错误的干部，必须追究责任，指出其错误的思想原因，及其错误所产生的或可能产生的对人民的危害，责成其严格检讨改正，个别情节重大的失职干部，必须给以应得的处分。检查结果，应采取适当方式在群众中与干部中公布，以教育群众与干部，严肃法纪。各级司法机关应注意人民日报及当地报纸对于处理婚姻案件错误的揭露，有关的司法机关必须迅速予以检查向报纸作负责的答复，并报告我们。
    此外，各级审判机关为了有力地与干涉婚姻自由杀害妇女的犯罪行为进行司法斗争，对于其中有重大教育意义的案件，应在事实审理明确并有充分准备后，召集群众进行公审宣判；使惩罚犯罪与启发群众自我教育预防犯罪相结合，与反对封建主义思想及其婚姻制度遗毒的群众运动相结合。最高人民法院分院与省（市）人民法院并可就全区或全省范围内选择典型性的案件，采取提审或就审的方法进行示范审判，以推动全面、大力贯彻政务院关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示。
