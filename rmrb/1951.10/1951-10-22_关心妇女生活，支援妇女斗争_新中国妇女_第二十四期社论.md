    Concern for Women's Lives, Support for Women's Struggle
    —Editorial from "New China Women," Issue 24
    Implementing the Marriage Law is crucial to the vital interests of women. Women's federations at all levels have done a lot of work in this regard, such as using various means to publicize the Marriage Law and assisting the government in mediating and judging marriage cases. This is very necessary. However, there are also shortcomings. The main one is that the work is not thorough enough, and the struggle against feudal ideology has not been firmly grasped. Why are there these shortcomings? The reason is that our women's work cadres lack a correct understanding of the struggle of women across the country to strive for freedom of marriage and oppose the feudal marriage system. Of course, this is a serious problem that exists among the vast majority of cadres and the masses. Now, let's analyze the three different attitudes towards this struggle among women cadres:
    The first attitude is to actively support women's struggle for freedom of marriage. They show boundless sympathy for women who are struggling for freedom of marriage, provide them with strong and concrete help, and lead women to victory. They can reason with evidence and engage in tireless struggles against certain incorrect ideas. They are good at arousing social opinion and mobilizing social forces to fight against feudal ideas by exposing specific cases. For example, the Henan Provincial Women's Federation, long before the promulgation of the Marriage Law, grasped the case of the murder of a widow in Huangji District, Huaiyang (this case occurred on January 7, 1949) to publicize to the society, criticize feudal ideas, and call on women's work cadres to earnestly care for the interests of women and conscientiously relieve the suffering of women. In the case of Liang Yongshi and his mother's abuse and murder of Liang Anshi, which was recently judged by the Central South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, they actively put forward opinions and fought against the phenomenon of disregarding women's legitimate interests, so that the case that had been delayed for two years and twenty days was resolved. Another example is the Women's Federation of Cixian County, Hebei Province, which wrote to the Hebei Daily for twelve women who committed suicide or were killed due to marriage problems. With a spirit of self-examination, they repeatedly made positive suggestions to the government, demanding a thorough solution. This attitude is correct and worth learning from.
    The second attitude is: not showing enough concern for women's struggle for freedom of marriage. They do not regard the vital suffering of women as their own suffering. Therefore, they have not actively supported and organized women to carry out anti-feudal ideological and anti-persecution struggles. They are satisfied with general, campaign-style publicity of the Marriage Law, but have not deeply checked the implementation of the Marriage Law, and have not regularly and systematically combined it with central work. Although they have raised opinions with relevant agencies regarding the serious phenomenon of women committing suicide or being killed due to lack of freedom in marriage, they have failed to adhere to principles, and have not dared to boldly and repeatedly put forward criticisms to seek a thorough solution. They adopt a liberal attitude towards the feudal ideas, procrastination and bureaucratic style of certain cadres, and dare not launch ideological criticism. Although this attitude is different from directly interfering with women's freedom of marriage, the result is the same: sacrificing the interests of women, even the lives of women.
    The third attitude is: directly interfering with women's freedom of marriage. A small number of rural women's work cadres have strong feudal ideas. They not only do not support women's struggles, but also hinder and interfere with women's freedom of marriage, and even collude with certain male cadres with feudal ideas to persecute women.
    Among the above three attitudes, the second one is more common. Among them, some women's work cadres have the view of simply completing tasks, and do not care much about the lives of women. They lack a deep understanding of the fact that freedom of marriage is the most central issue in women's problems. Therefore, when the central work is busy, they squeeze out the work related to the vital interests of women. They often pit the central work against the issue of caring for the vital interests of women, and often pit being responsible to the superiors against being responsible to the women. Solving this problem and unifying the two is not a matter of working methods, but a matter of ideology. In Chairman Mao's great work "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," this problem is solved very profoundly and vividly. Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are the leaders and organizers of revolutionary war, and we are also the leaders and organizers of the lives of the masses." Here, the lives of the masses referred to by Chairman Mao are the problems of clothing, food, housing, firewood, rice, oil, and salt of the masses, that is, the problems of marriage, childbirth, disease and health, and women learning plows, etc. We pay attention to solving the vital life problems of the women, such as marriage and childbirth, "the broad masses will definitely support us and regard the revolution as their lives" (Chairman Mao's words). Every one of our women's work cadres should study Chairman Mao's article well, to examine our thinking and correct our thinking.
    Among our women's work cadres, there are also a small number of people who do not care about the suffering of the women, do not actively support women's struggles, and are not at ease in doing women's work and are unwilling to serve the women. They think that "doing women's work is not of great help to their own progress and has no future!" They think that "women's work is one level lower than other work, and it is not glorious to do women's work!" Or they think that "women's work is difficult, no achievements can be made, and they are not suitable for it, so let others do it well." In the minds of these comrades, they often abandon the interests of the broad masses of women and pursue personal "progress" and personal "future." This kind of thinking is extremely wrong. It must be recognized that only by resolutely overcoming the idea of individualism, establishing a worldview of serving the people, and wholeheartedly and truly doing things and serving the women, can individuals make progress and have a future. If this is not done, and personal gains and losses are considered all day long, one will fall into distress and will accomplish nothing and be abandoned by the masses.
    Secondly, some women's work cadres, especially some women's work cadres in grass-roots organizations, are even supporters of feudal ideas. They do not approve of freedom of marriage, and think that free marriage is "being promiscuous," and that free divorce is also "very shameful." They believe that implementing freedom of marriage will lead to "chaos in the world." Therefore, they often do things that violate the Marriage Law. The thinking of these women cadres is certainly due to the influence of the ruling class for thousands of years, and also because the higher-level women's federations have not conducted regular education for them. There are also some women's work cadres who, although not supporters of feudal ideas, do not have a sufficient understanding of the harm of feudal ideas, and believe that the residual existence of feudal ideas is inevitable, and tacitly acknowledge it as a legitimate thing. Therefore, they also relax education for grass-roots women cadres. In this way, our women cadres who are closest to the women and live among the women cannot well support the struggles of the women. The higher-level women's federations' decisions to implement the Marriage Law cannot be implemented either. This is a serious problem, and it must be fundamentally solved by strengthening the ideological education of grass-roots women's work cadres in a planned way, especially the education against feudal ideas.
    Due to the above-mentioned erroneous ideas of women cadres, the struggle to support the broad masses of women in obtaining freedom of marriage lacks strength. The Marriage Law is a law protecting freedom of marriage. Because Chinese women have long been bound by the feudal marriage system, our women workers should especially strive to publicize and supervise the implementation of the Marriage Law. The fact that thousands upon thousands of women are still sacrificing themselves due to lack of freedom in marriage after the promulgation of the Marriage Law must arouse our serious attention. We should re-study the Marriage Law with a spirit of self-criticism, immediately change the erroneous ideas and attitudes of not caring about the suffering of women and not being at ease in women's work, and actively support women's struggles. Recently, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on checking the implementation of the Marriage Law, which is precisely a test for us. As the instructions point out: "Every cadre should realize that: Whether or not they can conscientiously and resolutely implement the Marriage Law; whether or not they can adopt a serious, prudent and responsible attitude to resolve marriage cases and protect the legitimate interests of women; whether or not they can actively support the masses (especially the oppressed women) in their just struggle against the feudal marriage system and against feudal ideas; and whether or not they can abide by the Marriage Law by setting an example when dealing with their own marriage problems; these are all serious tests of whether they are willing to thoroughly oppose feudalism politically, and also serious tests of whether they can strictly abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government." Many of our women cadres have undergone multiple tests such as the revolutionary war and the land reform, and they will certainly be able to withstand the test of implementing the Marriage Law. We should stand at the forefront of the struggle of women to strive for freedom of marriage and oppose the feudal marriage system, and become the leaders and organizers of the just struggle of women against the feudal marriage system and against feudal ideas. This is the glorious task of every one of our women's work cadres.

    关心妇女生活，支援妇女斗争
    ——“新中国妇女”第二十四期社论
    贯彻婚姻法关系着妇女的切身利益。各级妇联在这方面做了不少工作。如用各种方式宣传婚姻法，协助政府调解陪审婚姻案件等。这是很必要的。但是也有缺点。主要是：工作不深入，没有抓紧反封建思想的斗争。为什么会有这些缺点？原因就在于我们妇女工作者对于全国妇女群众争取婚姻自由，反对封建婚姻制度的斗争缺乏正确的认识。当然，这是存在于绝大多数干部和群众中的严重问题，现在就妇女干部中对于这一斗争的三种不同态度，作如下的分析：
    第一种态度是：积极支援妇女争取婚姻自由的斗争。她们对为争取婚姻自由而斗争的妇女，予以无限的同情，给以有力的具体的帮助，领导妇女取得胜利。她们能凭情据理，与某些不正确的思想作不倦的斗争。她们善于从揭发具体案件中，引起社会的舆论，动员社会的力量向封建思想作斗争。如河南省妇联，远在婚姻法公布前，就抓着淮阳黄集区寡妇被害案件（此案发生于一九四九年一月七日）向社会作宣传，批判封建思想，并号召妇女工作干部要切实关怀妇女的利益，认真负责的为妇女群众解除痛苦。在最近最高人民法院中南分院判决的梁永诗母子虐杀梁安氏的案件，她们曾积极提出意见并与漠视妇女合法利益的现象作斗争，使拖延了两年零二十天的案件得到解决。又如河北磁县妇联为十二名因婚姻问题自杀被杀的妇女写信给河北日报，以自我检讨的精神，再三向政府作积极的建议，要求彻底解决。这种态度都是正确的，值得学习的。
    第二种态度是：对妇女争取婚姻自由的斗争，表现不够关心。她们没有把妇女的切身痛苦当作自己的痛苦。因此，也就没有积极支援和组织妇女进行反封建思想及反迫害的斗争。她们满足于一般的突击性的宣传婚姻法，而没有深入检查婚姻法的执行情况，没有经常有计划的结合中心工作来做。她们对妇女因婚姻不自由而自杀被杀的严重现象，虽然也向有关机关提过意见，但未能坚持原则，不敢大胆地反复地提出批评，求得彻底解决。对某些干部的封建思想，拖延及官僚作风，采取自由主义态度，不敢开展思想批判。这种态度虽与直接干涉妇女婚姻自由有区别，但其结果却同样是牺牲妇女的利益，甚至妇女的生命。
    第三种态度是：直接干涉妇女的婚姻自由。有少数乡村妇女工作干部，有浓厚的封建思想，她们不仅不支援妇女斗争，还阻碍和干涉妇女的婚姻自由，甚至和某些有封建思想的男干部共同迫害妇女。
    以上三种态度，以第二种比较普遍。其中，有些妇女工作干部存在着单纯完成任务的观点，不大关心妇女群众的生活。对婚姻自由是妇女问题中最中心的问题，缺乏深刻的认识，所以中心工作一忙，就把有关妇女切身利益的工作挤掉了。她们往往把中心工作和关心妇女群众切身利益的问题对立起来，往往把对上级负责和对妇女群众负责对立起来。解决这个问题，使两者统一起来，不是工作方法问题，而是一个思想问题。在毛主席伟大的著作“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”里，就非常深刻生动地解决了这个问题。毛主席指出：“我们是革命战争的领导者、组织者，我们又是群众生活的领导者、组织者。”这里毛主席所指的群众生活，就是群众的穿衣、吃饭、住房、柴米油盐问题，就是群众的婚姻、生小孩、疾病卫生、妇女学习犁耙等问题。我们注意解决妇女群众的婚姻、生孩子等切身生活问题，“广大群众就必定拥护我们，把革命当作他们的生命”（毛主席语）。我们每个妇女工作干部应很好地学习毛主席这篇著作，来检查我们的思想，端正我们的思想。
    在我们妇女工作干部中，还有少数人，不关心妇女群众的痛苦，不积极支援妇女斗争，而且不安心做妇女工作，不愿意为妇女群众服务，她们认为“做妇女工作，对自己进步不大，没有前途！”她们认为“妇女工作比别的工作低一等，做妇女工作不光荣！”或者认为“妇女工作难做，做不出成绩，自己不适合，还是让别人做好”。在这些同志头脑中，经常是丢开了广大的妇女群众的利益，追求个人的“进步”和个人的“前途”。这种思想是极端错误的。必须认识，只有坚决克服个人主义的思想，建立为人民服务的人生观，全心全意地真正给妇女群众做了事，服了务，个人才有进步，才有前途，不这样做，整天考虑个人的得失，自己陷于苦恼，就将一事无成，被群众抛弃。
    其次，有些妇女工作干部，特别是有些基层组织的妇女工作干部，甚至是封建思想的拥护者，她们不赞成婚姻自由，认为自由结婚是“搞破鞋”，自由离婚也是“很可耻”的。她们认为实行婚姻自由，就会“天下大乱”。因此，常常做出违反婚姻法的事。这些妇女干部的思想，固然是由于几千年来统治阶级的影响，也由于上级妇联没有对她们进行经常的教育。还有些妇女工作干部虽然不是封建思想的拥护者，但对封建思想的危害性认识不足，认为封建思想的残余存在是不可免的，无形中承认它是合法的东西。因此，也就放松了对基层妇女干部的教育。这样，就使我们最接近妇女群众，生活在妇女群众中的妇女干部，不能很好地支援妇女的斗争。上级妇联贯彻婚姻法的决定也无法实行。这是一个严重的问题，必须有计划地加强基层妇女工作干部的思想教育，特别是反对封建思想的教育，才能得到根本的解决。
    由于妇女干部存在以上这些错误思想，就使得支援广大妇女群众取得婚姻自由的斗争缺乏力量。婚姻法是保护婚姻自由的法令。由于中国妇女长期遭受封建婚姻制度的束缚，我们妇女工作者，尤其应当努力宣传和监督执行婚姻法。在婚姻法公布后，仍有成千成万妇女因为婚姻不自由而牺牲这一事实必须引起我们严重注意。我们应该以自我批评的精神重新学习婚姻法，立刻转变不关心妇女痛苦，不安心妇女工作等错误思想和态度，积极支援妇女的斗争。最近中央人民政府政务院发出关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示，这正是对我们的考验。正如指示所指出的：“每个干部都应认识到：能否认真坚决地执行婚姻法；能否采取严肃慎重负责的态度解决婚姻案件，保护妇女的合法利益；能否积极支持群众（特别是被压迫的妇女群众），反对封建婚姻制度和反对封建思想的正义斗争；能否在处理自己本身的婚姻问题时以身作则地遵守婚姻法；这些，都是自己在政治上是否愿意彻底反对封建主义的严重考验，也是能否严格地遵守人民政府法令的严重考验。”我们有许多妇女干部经过了革命战争和土地改革等多次的考验，也一定能经得起贯彻婚姻法的考验。我们应站在妇女群众争取婚姻自由、反对封建婚姻制度斗争的最前线，成为妇女反对封建婚姻制度和反对封建思想的正义斗争的领导者与组织者。这是我们每个妇女工作干部的光荣任务。
