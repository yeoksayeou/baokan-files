    The Railway Engineering Corps on the Korean Front
    People's Volunteer Army Railway Engineering Corps Combat Hero Yang Lian'di
    On the Korean battlefield, the People's Volunteer Army Railway Engineering Corps, in order to ensure the smooth flow of supply lines and that military supplies could be delivered to the front-line combat troops in a timely manner, carried out arduous and heroic repair work.
    As everyone knows, American imperialism carried out inhumane bombings in Korea. There are also many rivers in Korea, and many bridges were destroyed by bombing. Especially in winter, we encountered many serious difficulties when carrying out repair work. However, we resolutely overcame all difficulties and ensured the completion of this glorious task.
    When repairing the "P'i-ryu River" bridge, it was the freezing winter, and more than 16,000 cubic meters of frozen soil and rock needed to be excavated. Enemy planes bombed during the day, making repairs impossible, and lighting could not be used at night. Excavating a frozen soil layer more than one meter deep was quite a difficult task. After exerting a lot of effort to dig down, only a spark was seen, and not even a fist-sized piece of soil could be dug out.
    When the comrades got hot from digging, they took off their cotton-padded clothes and wore only single-layer shirts. The snowflakes melted on the single-layer shirts, and when the wind blew, a thin layer of ice formed. After a short rest, they felt cold all over, and with another burst of energy, their bodies seemed to be steaming as if a pot had boiled over. This went on from dark to dawn. After a long time, I got sick, my eyes were bloodshot, and I couldn't eat all day. Everyone told me to rest, but I thought, "If the military supplies piled up at the head of the 'P'i-ryu River' bridge can't be sent up, how can the comrades fighting on the front line win the battle if they don't have enough to eat?" Therefore, I resolutely refused to rest.
    While excavating the earthwork, some comrades were responsible for drilling ice holes in the river center and lowering wooden cages. It was necessary to cut through more than one meter of ice and install wooden cages into the riverbed as bridge pier foundations. However, at that time, there were no ice-piercing tools, so we had to use pickaxes. When the pickaxes hit the ice, ice chips splashed all over our faces and bodies, and they were all melted by sweat. The northwest wind at night was very strong, freezing our clothes stiff. The broken ice floes floated on the surface of the water, hindering the lowering of the wooden cages, and there was no time to find tools for scooping up the ice. Everyone was anxious. Platoon Leader Chou Feng-chang, regardless of the coldness of the winter water, first jumped into the chest-deep river water to tie the rope to the ice floes, so that the comrades could pull them out. At this time, Squad Leader Wang Qian, Communist Party member Liu Huanfa, and six or seven other people also jumped into the river. They persisted in working in the water for a full nine hours.
    Our Railway Engineering Corps comrades, in order to strive to complete the task of repairing railway bridges ahead of schedule, used their brains and actively thought of ways to overcome difficulties and create new records. For example, when repairing the No. 101 Bridge on the Ch'ongch'on River, the bridge was washed away seven times due to flash floods, and several trains were stuck in the mountain caves and could not move forward. We proposed the method of building a pontoon bridge and completed the task two hours ahead of schedule. When excavating earthwork at the "P'i-ryu River," the first night, each person excavated an average of only 0.7 cubic meters of frozen soil, and the work efficiency was very low. Youth League member Liu Ji-ke and his group member Sun Shao-bin studied a method, and in one night, the two of them created the highest record of excavating seven cubic meters, increasing the efficiency of excavating frozen soil by ten times compared to the original.
    Repairing railway bridges on the Korean battlefield is like fighting a war on the front line. It is necessary to have a spirit of heroism, tenacity, and fearlessness of sacrifice in order to complete the task. Enemy planes bombed and strafed day and night, but they could not stop our repair work. When we were repairing the "Ryongjin River" bridge, we needed sleepers. Near the "Ryongjin River" there were Kong steel beams with more than forty pressure beams on them, and everyone was eager to go up and pick up these materials. However, this lonely bridge, seventeen meters high, was broken at both ends, and no one could get up there. Enemy planes were constantly bombing and strafing over the bridge. I thought, "When I was repairing the Longhai Railway in China, I climbed up a 45-meter-high bridge pier and won the glorious title of high-altitude hero. This 'Ryongjin River' bridge is not too high, could I lose this glorious title because of the threat of enemy planes?" I also thought:
    "The comrades fighting on the front lines are braving the danger of enemy planes, artillery fire, and shooting to seize the enemy's positions, how can I not brave the danger of enemy planes' bombing and strafing to seize these forty-odd pressure beams?" So I grabbed a bent steel beam and climbed up. Everyone shouted that it was dangerous and told me to come down quickly. The more I heard the comrades shouting, the more determined I was to climb up. Finally, I climbed up.
    Our Railway Engineering Corps comrades can not only fight against enemy planes, but also fight against harsh natural conditions and against floods and ice floes. For example, when the "P'i-ryu River" temporary bridge was about to be completed, it suddenly rained heavily for a day and a night. The rainwater melted the accumulated snow in the mountains, causing flash floods. The torrent rushed towards the "P'i-ryu River," breaking through the ice more than one meter thick, and the huge ice floes completely washed away the completed river center project. When this shocking news came, everyone immediately got up, put on their cotton-padded clothes, ran to the river bank, and jumped into the water to rescue. A soldier named Li Ming-yao was carrying a large square timber to the shore when two ice floes collided, smashing the ice floe he was stepping on, and he fell into the river along with the timber. The current was too rapid, and the ice floes rolled, pressing him into the water. The comrades told him to let go of the timber quickly, but he never let go, and finally rescued the material. Deputy Platoon Leader Yin Yu-chang was pressed into the water three times by ice floes, suffering five injuries on his body. The company commander told him to go ashore to rest, but he said, "Materials are more important than life. Without them, the bridge cannot be repaired, and the victory on the front cannot be guaranteed."
    This is how our Railway Engineering Corps comrades are carrying out our sacred task on the Korean battlefield. (Attached image)

    铁道兵团在朝鲜前线
    人民志愿军铁道兵团战斗英雄  杨连第
    在朝鲜战场上，人民志愿军铁道兵团为了保证补给线的畅通，使军用物资能够及时地送到前方作战部队的手里，进行了艰苦的、英勇的抢修工作。
    大家都知道，美帝国主义在朝鲜进行了灭绝人性的轰炸；朝鲜的江河又多，很多桥梁都被炸毁，特别是在冬天，我们进行抢修工作时，要遇到许多严重的困难。但是，我们坚决地克服了一切困难，保证了这个光荣的任务的完成。
    在修“沸流江”桥时，正值天寒地冻的冬天，需要挖一万六千多立方米冻土和岩石，白天敌机轰炸，不能抢修，夜间不能使用灯光照明，要刨一米多深的冻土层是一个相当吃力的工作。用了很大劲刨下去，只看冒一股火星，刨不出拳头大一块土。
    同志们刨热了就脱去棉衣，穿着单布衫，雪花落在单布衫上溶化了，被风一吹，就冻一层薄冰，稍一休息，浑身冰凉，再一加劲，身上就像开锅似地冒热气。像这样从天黑挖到天亮。日子久了，我病了，眼睛也熬红了，成天不能吃饭，大家都叫我休息，我想：“‘沸流江’桥头上堆着的军需品，送不上去，前方作战的同志们如果吃不上饭，怎能打胜仗呢？”因此，我坚决不休息。
    在挖土方的同时，有一部分同志担当江心穿冰孔，下木笼工作。需要刨开一米多厚的冰，往江底按装木笼，做为桥墩基础。但是，当时没有穿冰工具，只好用镐刨，洋镐刨到冰上，溅得满身满脸的冰花，又都给汗溶化了。夜里的西北风很硬，吹得衣服都冻的梆梆硬。刨碎的冰块，漂在水面，妨碍木笼下水，必须把冰块捞出，可是时间又不允许去找捞冰的工具，大家都急了。排长仇凤章也顾不得冬天的水冷，首先跳下齐胸的江水把绳子拴在冰块上，让同志们往外拉。这时班长王谦，共产党员刘焕发等六、七个人也跳进江里，他们在水里坚持工作整整九小时。
    我们铁道兵团的同志们为了争取提前完成抢修铁路桥梁的任务，都开动了脑筋，积极地想办法克服困难，创造新纪录。比如在清川江抢修一○一大桥时，由于山洪暴发，修起的桥，曾被冲毁七次，好几列火车都挤在山洞里不能往前开，我们提出搭浮桥的办法，提前两小时完成了任务。在“沸流江”挖土方时，第一夜，每人平均只挖○·七公方冻土，工作效率很低，青年团员刘继可和他的组员孙绍滨同志研究了一个办法，一夜两个人创造了挖掘七公方的最高纪录，挖冻土效率比原来增加了十倍。
    在朝鲜战场上抢修铁路桥梁，也像前线部队打仗一样，必需要有英勇、顽强、不怕牺牲的精神，才能完成任务。敌人飞机昼夜不断地轰炸、扫射，但是不能阻止我们的抢修工作。当我们在抢修“龙津江”桥时，需要枕木，在“龙津江”附近有孔钢梁，上面有四十多根压梁木，大家都急着要上去拣这些材料。但是，这座十七米高的孤独桥梁，两头都炸断了，谁也没法上去，敌人飞机在桥梁上空，不断的轰炸扫射，我想：“在国内修陇海路的时候，我爬上四十五米高的桥墩，取得登高英雄的光荣称号，这座‘龙津江’桥并不太高，难道我就能因敌机的威胁，失掉我这光荣的称号吗？”又想：
    “前方作战的同志们冒着敌机、大炮轰炸、射击的危险，去夺敌人的阵地，我怎就不能冒着敌机轰炸扫射的危险，去夺这四十多根压梁木？”于是我抓住弯下来的一条钢梁，就往上爬，大家都喊着危险，叫我赶快下来，我听着同志们越喊，越有决心往上爬，终于爬上去了。
    我们铁道兵团的同志们，不仅能同敌人飞机搏斗，而且也同恶劣的自然条件搏斗，向洪水冰排进行搏斗。如在“沸流江”便桥将要完成的时候，突然下了一天一夜的大雨，雨水浸化了山中的积雪，使山洪暴发，激流冲向“沸流江”，把一米多厚的冰涨破了，巨大的冰排把已完成的江心工程全部冲垮了。这个惊人的消息传来，大家立刻爬起，披着棉衣，跑到江岸跳下水去抢救。有个战士李明尧正扛着一根大方木往岸上跑，两块冰排撞在一起，把他踏的那块冰排撞碎，连人带木头一齐掉下江去，水流太急，冰排翻滚，把他压进水里。同志们都叫他赶快放开木头，而他始终没放，终于把这棵材料抢上来了。副排长尹玉常三次被冰排压到水底，身上五处受伤，连长叫他上岸休息，他说：“材料比生命都重要，没有它就修不上桥，就不能保障前方的胜利。”
    我们铁道兵团的同志们，就是这样在朝鲜战场上执行着我们神圣的任务。（附图片）
