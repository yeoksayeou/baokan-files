    Heroic Steel Company
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Zheng Qi
    On December 30th of last year, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army crossed the Linjin River, and our Steel Company was assigned the task of making a breakthrough. We only used eight minutes to smash the "impregnable Linjin River defense line" that the American devils boasted about. Then we pursued the enemy to Buguli, 45 miles away from Seoul. At this time, the British 27th Brigade's "White Tiger Regiment" deployed firepower on the mountains on both sides of the road intersection. After we captured two small hilltops, it was already dawn, and the high mountains on all three sides were full of enemies. The company commander said to us: "We must hold this small hill to contain the enemy's forces so that the second echelon can catch up and annihilate them!" As soon as I heard that this hilltop was so important, I swore to the company commander: "I am a Communist Party member, I am determined to hold the position and never retreat!" I also encouraged everyone: "Don't look down on our small number of people and weak firepower, as long as we are determined, we can hold this hill, and the enemy will not be able to attack!"
    The enemy began to attack, with cannons, small guns, and machine guns all firing at our hilltop, and we also fiercely fought back. While we were fighting, the company commander was wounded, but he still got up and said to us: "Remember! We are the Steel Company! The Steel Company has never fought a losing battle!" I said: "Company commander, don't worry, the position cannot be lost." I remembered the resolution I made in the Party group meeting: if the cadres are wounded or killed, I will automatically act as an agent, no matter what, I must complete the task. I picked up the company commander's pistol and said to everyone: "The company commander is injured, we must resolutely hold this hilltop, as long as someone is here, the position is here..." After I made arrangements, the enemy sent up two more platoons, and we knocked down more than ten of them. Several of our comrades were also wounded or killed. I transferred the third platoon from the back of the mountain. I said to everyone: "We have more people now, we must hold this small hilltop!" Then the enemy rushed up again, and we used a burst of hand grenades to drive the enemy back. After the enemy retreated, this time the artillery fire on the big mountains was concentrated on bombarding our small hilltop. We all calmed down and crawled in the snow. I led six soldiers to guard the very front of the small hill. At this time, we had no bullets, so I crawled through the enemy's blockade line and took some bullets from the wounded and dead comrades. I crawled back and forth three or four times, and I told everyone to save ammunition and only fire when the enemy gets close. Rifles and machine guns should all fire single shots.
    I also encouraged everyone: "We must hold this position, otherwise the rear troops will not be able to rest well." Everyone said: "Okay, we are determined to hold the position." The enemy had two or three more platoons counterattacking, and we killed a dozen of them, and the rest ran away.
    I transferred the first platoon from the back of the mountain again and told them to hold this hilltop and wait for the troops to attack. In the afternoon, the enemy slowly climbed up from three sides. At this time, all three machine guns were broken, and the gunner Comrade Li Jiafu used parts from two guns to make one. When the enemy climbed halfway up the mountain, I ordered to start shooting. Ammunition handler Yang Zhanshan told me that the bullets were running out. I said: "It doesn't matter, I'll go find some!" I went down the mountain to find bullets and found twenty or so bullets from the sacrificed comrades. When the sun was about to set, we ran out of bullets again, leaving only two hand grenades. The enemy slowly rushed up again. Comrade Cong Shuqing and others threw the last hand grenade when the enemy was close, scattering the enemy in all directions. At this time, I immediately blew the bugle to charge. The enemy thought we were going to charge and ran back with their tails between their legs.
    After this battle, I was awarded a special merit and promoted to deputy platoon leader. This is my honor, and also the honor of the Party and the people, because with the leadership of the Party and the enthusiastic support of the Chinese and Korean people, I have this honor.
    This time when I returned to the motherland, seeing that the people of the motherland are living a happy life and that the motherland's production and construction have also achieved great results, I am even more determined to defend the motherland and eliminate the American devils. When I return to the front, I will strive for more merits and eliminate more American devils.

    英雄的钢铁连
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  郑起
    去年十二月三十日，人民志愿军打过临津江，我们钢铁连担任突击任务。我们只用了八分钟的时间，就把美国鬼子所吹嘘的“坚如铜墙的临津江防线”打垮了；接着我们把敌人追击到离汉城四十五里地的釜谷里。这时，英军二十七旅的“白老虎团”，在公路交叉点两旁的山上布置了火力。我们打下了两个小山头以后，天就大亮了，这时三面的高山上都是敌人。连长对我们说：“我们要在这个小山上，牵制敌人的兵力，好让二梯队赶上来消灭他们！”我一听这个山头这么重要，就向连长宣誓：“我是共产党员，我坚决要守住阵地，决不后退！”我又鼓励大家：“别看我们人少火力弱，只要我们有决心，就能守住这个山头，敌人就攻不上来！”
    敌人开始攻击了，大炮小炮和机枪，都对着我们这个山头打，我们也猛烈地还击。正打着，连长负了伤，但他还爬起来对我们说：“记住！我们是钢铁连！钢铁连，从来没有打过败仗！”我说：“连长，你放心，阵地不能丢。”我当时想起我在党的小组会上下了决心：要是干部有伤亡，就自动代理，不管怎样也要完成任务。我就拾起连长的驳壳枪，对大家说：“连长挂彩了，我们几个人要坚决守住这个山头，有人在就有阵地在……”我布置好了以后，敌人又上来两个班，叫我们打倒了他十多个，我们也有几个同志伤亡了，我就把后山上的三班调了上来，我对大家说：“我们的人又多了，一定要把这个小山头守住！”接着敌人又冲上来了，我们一阵手榴弹，又把敌人打退了。敌人退了以后，这回大山上的炮火，都集中轰击我们这个小山头。我们都沉住了气，爬在雪里，我带着六个战士，守住小山的最前沿。这时候，我们没有子弹了，我就爬过了敌人的封锁线，从伤亡的同志身上拿下一些子弹，我来回爬了三、四次，我告诉大家要节省弹药，敌人到跟前再打，步枪、机枪都要打单发。
    我又鼓励大家：“我们要守住这个阵地，要不然后面部队不能好好休息。”大家都说：“好，我们坚决要守住阵地。”敌人又有两三个班反击，叫我们打死十来个，其余的都跑了。
    我又把后山的一班调上来，告诉他们要守住这个山头，等着部队出击。下午敌人又慢慢从三面往上爬，这时三挺机枪都打坏了，射手李家福同志就把两挺配造一挺，等敌人爬到半山腰，我就命令开始射击，弹药手杨占山告诉我子弹快打完了。我说： “没有关系，我去找！”我就下山去找子弹，从牺牲的同志身上找出二十来发子弹。到太阳快偏西的时候，我们的子弹又打完了，只剩下两个手榴弹。敌人又慢慢冲上来了。丛树清同志等敌人快到跟前的时候，掷出了最后一颗手榴弹，打得敌人东逃西散。我这时就马上吹起冲锋号，敌人以为我们要冲锋，夹着尾巴又跑回去了。
    这次战斗结束，我立了一特功，提升为副排长，这是我的光荣，也是党和人民的光荣，因为有了党的领导和中、朝人民的热烈支援，我才有这个光荣。
    这次回到祖国来，看到祖国人民过着幸福的生活，祖国的生产建设也搞得很有成绩，更加强我们保卫祖国和消灭美国鬼子的决心。回到前方去，我要争取功上加功，更多地消灭美国鬼子。
