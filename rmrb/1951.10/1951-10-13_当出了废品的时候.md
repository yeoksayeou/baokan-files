	When Defective Products Appear
	Tian Liu
	Not long ago, in the molding workshop of the Fourth Northeast Rubber Factory, the following incident occurred:
	Liu Yonghui, a worker in the sixth group of Class C, produced a defective shoe during the night shift. At the time, he was afraid of affecting the output, so he did not immediately report it to the production team leader (now he still considers this a major shortcoming). At the time, he threw the defective product far aside, so that the inspector wouldn't accidentally pack it into a box as a good shoe. Who knew that after he got off work in the morning, the defective product was gone.
	He asked the team leader, but the team leader said he hadn't seen it.
	He asked the inspector, and the inspector said that he had always been strict and conscientious in inspecting products, and any defective products would have been found by him long ago.
	In our people's enterprises, workers labor with the attitude of masters. Making defective products is considered a shameful thing. Therefore, no one wants to produce defective products, and they always pay attention and take care at all times during production, trying to improve the quality of their products as much as possible.
	Now the team leader and the inspector both said that he had not produced any defective products, but Liu Yonghui still insisted that he had produced a defective product: "Am I making up that I produced a defective product just to embarrass myself?"
	Although Liu Yonghui argued like he was quarreling, no one believed him. The facts were all there. The entire workshop had only produced these few third-class products, and no matter how they looked, they couldn't find that defective product. The third-class products had all been checked out, so how could the defective product have been overlooked? Everyone said that he must have been constantly thinking: don't produce defective products, don't produce defective products... and mistakenly remembered it. He mistakenly remembered that he had produced a defective product when there wasn't one.
	This matter could not be cleared up. Finally, Liu Yonghui went directly to the workshop director and the factory director, requesting permission to reopen the boxes that had already been packed to look for the defective shoe. Liu Yonghui is a young, cheerful worker, who usually can't stop laughing and singing, but now he was so anxious that his face was red and his eyes were a little wet. "These are for the Volunteers to wear," he stated to the factory director, "How can we let the Volunteer comrades fight the American devils wearing a defective shoe?"
	The factory director had already learned about this matter from others, and had already decided how to resolve it, but he still asked Liu Yonghui if he remembered clearly, that he definitely produced a defective product, and explained that this batch of shoes was not for the Volunteers.
	"Even if it's not for the Volunteers," Liu Yonghui replied to the factory director's inquiry, and still insisted: "I can't ruin the factory's reputation because of one shoe of mine."
	The factory director granted his request.
	He opened the boxes. All the workmates in the team, regardless of the fatigue of working all night, helped him look. From six o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock, and then from four o'clock in the afternoon to ten o'clock at night, they opened a total of eighty-six boxes before they found that defective product.
	It is precisely because of the working class's selfless concern for the people's enterprises and their selfless creative labor that the production of the Fourth Rubber Factory is improving day by day, and the quality of its products is improving day by day. Now, all the employees of the Fourth Rubber Factory are carrying out a massive production increase and economy campaign. They plan that each worker will increase production and save wealth worth an average of one hundred tons of grain for the country this year. By the end of September, the workers of the Fourth Rubber Factory will have created an excess of 48,843 tons of grain.

    当出了废品的时候
    田流
    不久前，东北第四橡胶厂压成车间，发生过这样的一件事情：
    丙班六组工人刘永惠，在夜班生产时，出了一只坏鞋。当时，他怕影响产量，没有立时去向生产组长汇报（现在谈起来他还认为这是个很大的缺点）。他当时把那只废品远远地撂在一边，免得检查员一个不注意，当好鞋装了箱子。谁知早上下班后，那只废品不见了。
    问组长，组长说没有见。
    问检查员，检查员说从来检查产品就严格认真，有废品早给他检查出来了。
    在我们的人民企业里，工人们都以主人翁的态度进行劳动。做出废品，被认为是件很羞耻的事情。因此，谁都不愿意出废品，生产时总是时时注意处处留心，尽量改善自己的产品质量。
    现在组长、检查员都说他没有出废品，但刘永惠还是坚持说自己出了废品：“莫非我没出废品，故意说有，自找丢脸？”
    虽然刘永惠吵架似的争辩，可是别人还是不信。事实俱在，全车间统共出了这几只三等品，左翻右转也找不到有那只废品。三等品都检查出来了，难道废品还会马虎过去？大家都说他一定是脑筋里总是想着：别出废品，别出废品……一时记错了。本来没有废品误记成出了废品了。
    这件事总也说不清。最后，刘永惠直接去找车间主任和厂长，请求允许他把已经装好了的箱子重新打开，寻找那只坏鞋。刘永惠是个年青快活的青年工人，平常总是闭不上嘴的又笑又唱的，现在竟急得脸红红的，眼睛都有点湿润了。 “这是给志愿军穿的”，他向厂长申述：“能让志愿军同志穿着一只坏鞋同美国鬼子作战么？”
    厂长已从别人那里知道了这件事情，而且已经决定了如何解决，但他还是问刘永惠是不是记得很清楚，一定出了废品，并且说明这批鞋子不是给志愿军的。
    “就是不给志愿军”，刘永惠回答了厂长的询问以后，仍然坚持说：“我也不能因我的一只鞋子，坏了工厂的名誉。”
    厂长答应了他的请求。
    他打开箱子。全班的工友们，也不顾工作了整夜的疲劳帮助他找，从早晨六点钟到十点钟，又从下午四点钟到晚上十点钟，一直打开了八十六个箱子，才找到了那只废品。
    正是工人阶级对人民企业这种无私的关怀，忘我地进行着创造性的劳动，橡胶四厂的生产才一天天提高，产品质量才一天天改善。现在，橡胶四厂全体职工，正开展着巨大的增产节约运动，他们计划，每个工人今年平均为国家增产和节约价值一百吨粮食的财富，到九月底，橡胶四厂的工人同志们，就创造出四万八千八百四十三吨粮食的超额财富。
