    The Soviet People Fight for Peace and Friendship Among Nations
    Aobalin, Member of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee and Member of the World Peace Council

    On behalf of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression and the hundreds of millions of Chinese people it represents on their achievements in the peace front, and wish them further achievements in the most noble cause of defending world peace.

    The struggle to defend peace has become a cause closely linked to the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of working people in all countries and continents. Good people know that only the active and resolute actions of all peace-loving people can safeguard peace.

    Comrade Stalin taught us: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend it to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the warmongers succeed in ensnaring the masses with lies, deceiving the masses, and dragging them into another world war, then war may become inevitable."

    "It is for this reason that the broad movement to maintain peace, as a tool for exposing the sinister schemes of the warmongers, is now of the utmost importance."

    The great Stalin's famous words are a guiding star for the sacred cause of defending the peace and security of all peoples.

    The great example of the Soviet Union, which is engaged in a thorough struggle for peace and friendship among all nations, inspires the masses of people in all countries in the cause of defending peace.

    Imperialists and the newspapers manipulated and bought by them are doing everything possible to conceal the truth about the Soviet state's peaceful policies and the achievements of building a communist country from ordinary people. But the people of the world know that the Soviet Union is a strong fortress of world peace.

    The Soviet Union's peace-loving Stalinist foreign policy has profound principles and consistency. The struggle for lasting peace and people's democracy is the main content of Soviet foreign policy. It stems from the essence of the Soviet socialist state, because there are no classes or groups here. The working people of the Soviet Union are educated in the spirit of friendship and peace among all nations by the Lenin-Stalin Party.

    People all over the world are fighting for peace in various ways in every corner of the globe. The patriots of Korea and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers are defending their right to peaceful labor with weapons in their hands. Dockworkers in France are preventing the transportation of American weapons. Mass protest rallies have been held in many countries, submitting many petitions to parliaments and resolutely demanding that governments take urgent measures to stop the warmongers.

    The great Chinese people have closely combined their struggle for peace with the struggle against American imperialism.

    The working people of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries are consolidating the cause of peace with their creative labor. Our greatest fortune lies in the fact that we do not have to expend our strength in overcoming internal contradictions, that our aspirations for peace are consistent, and that we are fighting for peace wholeheartedly with the Soviet government under the leadership of the Communist Party and its brilliant leader, Comrade Stalin.

    The Soviet people are successfully realizing the great plan of communist construction. The victorious completion of the first post-war Five-Year Plan, the construction of communist projects on the Volga River, the Dnieper River, the Don River, the Amu Darya River, and the implementation of Stalin's plan to transform nature are brilliant evidence of the Soviet state's peaceful aspirations and a valuable contribution to the cause of peace and security for the people.

    The people believe that peace will triumph throughout the world. The great victory of our socialist motherland in the cause of building communism and its tireless struggle for world peace inspire millions of people with the belief that the cause of peace will surely triumph.

    The unbreakable friendship between the powerful Soviet Union and the 500 million people of China under the leadership of the great leader Mao Zedong inspires this belief.

    The fact that the great standard-bearer of peace, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, is leading peace also inspires people of all ethnic groups with the belief that the cause of peace will surely triumph. (The title of this article was added by the editor.) (Attached image)

    苏联人民为各国人民间的和平与友好而斗争
    苏联保卫和平委员会委员世界和平理事会理事  奥巴林
    我谨代表苏联保卫和平委员会，首先向中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会和它所代表的全体数亿中国人民热烈地祝贺他们在和平战线上的成就，并预祝在保卫世界和平的最崇高的事业中获得进一步的成就。
    保卫和平的斗争已成为各国和各洲亿万劳动人民的血肉相关的事业。善良的人们知道：只有一切爱好和平人民的积极而坚决的行动才能保卫住和平。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那末战争就可能变得不可避免。
    “就是因为这个缘故，广泛的维护和平运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具，现在具有最重大的意义。”
    伟大的斯大林的名言，是捍卫各国人民和平与安全的神圣事业的指路明星。
    为各国人民间的和平与友好而进行着彻底斗争的苏联底伟大榜样，在保卫和平的事业中鼓舞着各国的人民群众。
    帝国主义者和为他们所操纵收买的报刊，在千方百计地对普通人们隐瞒关于苏联国家底和平政策以及建设共产主义国家之成就的真象。但是全世界人民知道，苏联是世界和平的强大堡垒。
    苏联的爱好和平的斯大林的对外政策是有着深刻的原则性和一贯性的。为持久和平与人民民主的斗争是苏联对外政策的主要内容，它是从苏联社会主义国家的本质产生出来的，因为在这里没有阶级和集团。苏联的劳动人民都受着列宁——斯大林党的与各国人民间友好与和平的精神的教育。
    全世界人民在地球的各个角落上用各种不同的方法为和平事业进行着斗争。朝鲜的爱国者和英勇的中国人民志愿军，手持武器保卫着自己从事和平劳动的权利。法国的码头工人阻止运输美国的武器。在很多国家里召开了声势浩大的群众抗议大会，向议会提出许多的请愿书并向政府坚决要求采取制止战争贩子的紧急措施。
    伟大的中国人民把自己争取和平的斗争，同反对美帝国主义的斗争，坚密地结合起来。
    苏联人民、中国和各人民民主国家的劳动人民，正在用自己的创造性的劳动巩固和平的事业。我们最大的幸运就在于我们无须把自己的力量消耗在克服内部的矛盾上，在于我们对于和平的热望是一致的，而且我们在共产党及其天才的领袖斯大林同志的领导下与苏联政府同心协力地进行着争取和平的斗争。
    苏联人民正在顺利地实现着共产主义建设的伟大计划。第一个战后五年计划的胜利完成，伏尔加河与第聂伯河、顿河与阿姆、达里亚河上的共产主义工程的兴建以及斯大林改造自然的计划的实现——是苏维埃国家和平愿望的光辉证据，是苏联人民对于人民的和平与安全事业的宝贵贡献。
    人民相信，和平会在全世界胜利。我们的社会主义祖国在建设共产主义事业上的伟大胜利及其争取世界和平的不倦斗争，鼓舞着千百万人对和平事业必胜的信念。
    强大的苏联与伟大领袖毛泽东领导下的中国五亿人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，鼓舞着这个信念。
    伟大的和平旗手约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇·斯大林之领导和平的这一事实，也鼓舞着各族人民对和平事业必胜的信念。（本文标题是编者加的）（附图片）
