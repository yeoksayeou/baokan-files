    New Society Gives Women a New Life
    ——After Reading "I Was Elected Deputy District Chief"
    Editor:
    I was deeply moved after reading Comrade Huang Yuehua's article "I Was Elected Deputy District Chief," published in the People's Daily on September 29th.
    This article not only tearfully and powerfully accuses the old society of the suffering it inflicted on good people, but also depicts how the old society deprived people of their youth and hope. Huang Yuehua's experience is precisely the experience of thousands of female intellectuals in the old society; the excitement and new life that the new society has given Huang Yuehua also represents the excitement and new life of thousands of female intellectuals.
    A university science graduate whose "brainpower and intelligence had deteriorated" after enduring eleven years of hunger and torment, only began to sprout and grow again after liberation, like withered grass receiving spring rain and seeing the sun again. What kind of spirit is this? Only the people living in the new China can appreciate it.
    I hope the People's Daily will publish more articles of this kind. These articles will increase people's love for the new China and their love for the Communist Party and the People's Government. These articles are vivid teaching materials for conducting patriotic education.
                                            Qian Xuan

### 新社会使妇女获得新生——读“我当选了副区长”之后

    新社会使妇女获得新生
    ——读“我当选了副区长”之后编辑同志：
    我读了人民日报九月二十九日发表的黄月华同志的“我当选了副区长”一文后，极为感动。
    这篇文章，不仅有声有泪地控诉了旧社会给予善良人民的磨难，并且刻划了旧社会怎样剥夺了人们的青春和希望。黄月华的经历，正是旧社会中千百个妇女知识分子的经历；新社会给予黄月华的兴奋和新生，也正代表了千百个妇女知识分子的兴奋和新生。
    一个忍受了十一年饥饿和折磨的“脑力、智慧都退步了”的大学理科毕业生，解放后，才像枯草得了春雨又见到太阳一样，重新发芽生长起来。这是股什么劲头呢？这只有生活在新中国的人民才会体会到的。
    我希望人民日报多登一些这类的文章。这类文章会使人们增加对新中国的热爱，对共产党和人民政府的热爱。这类文章是进行爱国主义教育的生动教材。
                                            乾玄
