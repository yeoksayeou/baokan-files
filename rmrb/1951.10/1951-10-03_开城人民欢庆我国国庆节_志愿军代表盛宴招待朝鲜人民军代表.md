    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 2nd: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation participating in the armistice negotiations in Kaesong celebrated the second National Day of the People's Republic of China.
    On October 1st, the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers held a grand banquet to entertain the representatives of the Korean People's Army. A representative of the Volunteer Army delivered a speech at the banquet. After briefly describing the great achievements of the new China in national defense, politics, economy, culture and other constructions in the past two years, and the brilliant victories in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in the past year, he said: All these show the power of the great unity of the 475 million people, and show that in the face of the great Chinese people, any difficulties can be overcome, and our just cause will surely succeed. He further pointed out: The consolidation and development of the People's Republic of China is not only a victory for the Chinese people, but also a victory for the peace-loving people of the world, especially the oppressed people of the East. The great unity of 800 million people based on the unity of the Chinese and Soviet people guarantees the success of world peace and people's democratic cause. The Volunteer Army representative also pointed out: It is of great significance to commemorate China's National Day at the critical juncture of the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and when the Kaesong armistice negotiations are being obstructed and undermined by US imperialism. Although the Korean peace negotiations are currently facing many difficulties, the existence and development of the great People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the unbreakable unity and friendship between the two peoples, have constituted an incomparably powerful force. In the face of this force, any imperialist conspiracy will be defeated, and peace in Korea will surely be achieved. General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean People's Army, repeatedly stood up to congratulate China's National Day and toasted for the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people.
    The people of Kaesong City also warmly celebrated China's National Day. On the morning of the 1st, the streets of Kaesong City were plastered with slogans such as "Celebrating the Second Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China," "Salute to the Great Chinese People's Volunteers," and "Long Live the Great Unity of the Asian People." People's representatives from all walks of life in the city organized delegations and performing arts troupes to visit and express their regards to the military police personnel guarding the Kaesong Neutral Zone in the suburbs. The Kaesong Women's Alliance presented hundreds of commemorative badges embroidered with the words "Long Live Korean-Chinese Friendship" to the Volunteer Army heroes. Farmers in the suburbs also comforted the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters with vegetables produced by their own labor. The performing arts troupes and the peace fighters guarding Kaesong held a get-together, and the members of the performing arts troupes performed various beautiful Korean dances at the meeting. The Kaesong military police personnel also invited their Korean landlords to gather for a meal to celebrate the festival together, and expressed their determination to strive for peace in Korea.

    开城人民欢庆我国国庆节
    志愿军代表盛宴招待朝鲜人民军代表
    【新华社开城二日电】在开城参加停战谈判的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团欢庆中华人民共和国第二届国庆节。
    十月一日，我国志愿军代表特设盛大宴会招待朝鲜人民军代表。志愿军代表在宴会上发表讲演。他略述新中国两年来在国防、政治、经济、文化等建设中的伟大成就及一年来在抗美援朝运动中的辉煌胜利后说：所有这些都显示着四亿七千五百万人民大团结的力量，显示着在伟大的中国人民面前，任何困难都是能够克服的，我们的正义事业是一定能够成功的。他进一步指出：中华人民共和国的巩固和发展，不仅是中国人民的胜利，而且也是世界和平人民特别是东方被压迫人民的胜利，以中苏两国人民为团结基础的八万万人民大团结，更保证了世界和平与人民民主事业的成功。志愿军代表又指出：在抗美援朝严重斗争的关头，在开城停战谈判遭受美帝国主义阻挠和破坏的时候来纪念中国国庆，更具有重大的意义。虽然朝鲜和平谈判在目前还有重重的困难，但伟大的中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的存在和发展，两国人民牢不可破的团结与友谊，已构成了无比强大的力量，在这个力量的面前，任何帝国主义的阴谋都会被打败的，朝鲜的和平是一定能实现的。朝鲜人民军首席代表南日将军再三起立为祝贺我国国庆、为朝中人民的友谊而干坏。
    开城市人民也热烈庆祝我国国庆节。一日晨，开城市街头贴满了“庆祝中华人民共和国成立两周年”、“向伟大的中国人民志愿军致敬”和“亚洲人民大团结万岁”的标语，该市各界人民代表特组织代表团和演出队分赴城郊各地慰问守卫开城中立区的军事警察人员。开城市女性同盟以数百个绣有“朝中亲善万岁”字样的纪念章献赠给志愿军功臣。城郊农民亦以自己劳动生产的菜蔬慰问志愿军指战员。演出队与警卫开城的和平战士们举行了联欢会，演出队队员们在会上演出各种优美的朝鲜舞蹈。开城军事警察人员也邀请朝鲜房东聚餐同庆佳节，并相互表示为争取朝鲜和平的决心。
