    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 4th: Our correspondent reports: The illegal act of the American aggressors using Japanese soldiers in the war of aggression against Korea has been further proven. On September 4th, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured another Japanese soldier, Yasui Tatsufumi, in the Changdan area on the Imjin River front, who was serving as a reconnaissance soldier in the Rhee Syngman bandit army's 1st Division. After being captured, Yasui Tatsufumi used the alias Cha Ryong-mun and spoke broken and incomprehensible Korean, afraid to admit that he was Japanese. However, moved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's lenient policy towards prisoners, he finally revealed his experiences.

    According to Yasui Tatsufumi, he is 24 years old and originally lived in Fuse City, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. Before participating in the war of aggression against Korea, he was an unemployed sewing worker. In September of last year, the American occupation authorities in Japan and the Japanese Yoshida government, under the name of the "Republic of Korea Representative Office in Japan," recruited more than a thousand Japanese youths to form the so-called "Korean Salvation Volunteer Corps." Yasui Tatsufumi and other recruited Japanese were transferred to Tokyo on September 25th of last year. They received American military uniforms and, under the supervision of American soldiers, were transported via Yokohama to Korea, landing at Incheon Port on September 29th of last year. After a short period of training, they were divided into groups of 20 to 30 and incorporated into the U.S. and Rhee Syngman army units. A group of 20 people, including Yasui Tatsufumi, were incorporated into a certain unit of the 330th U.S. Army. Soon after, many South Korean soldiers were transferred from Daegu, and they were formed into the 65th and 85th units. Yasui Tatsufumi was later transferred to the Rhee Syngman army's 1st Division. There were a total of 22 Japanese soldiers in his reconnaissance squad.

    Yasui Tatsufumi said that, as far as he knew, they were the third batch of Japanese soldiers transported to Korea by the U.S. military, with a total of more than 2,000 people in the first two batches. The American occupation authorities and the Japanese reactionaries have also shamelessly fabricated documents in an attempt to cover up their illegal acts. Yasui Tatsufumi carried two documents: one was the "Foreigner Registration Certificate" No. 51027 issued by Mayor Shozo Shiokawa of Fuse City, Osaka Prefecture; the other was the "Republic of Korea National Registration Certificate" issued by the so-called "Republic of Korea Representative Office in Japan." He said that the officials who issued the certificates warned them at the time not to reveal that they were Japanese or speak Japanese again after arriving in Korea.

    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: While American imperialism is using various despicable means to delay the Kaesong armistice negotiations, the United States continues to use Japanese munitions factories to manufacture a large number of weapons of aggression for killing people in Korea. According to a special report in the August 22nd "Truth" special communication, the U.S. Far East Air Force Command issued orders in late August to Japanese companies such as Asia Industrial Co., Saitama Automobile Co., Tokyo Coal and Electricity Co., Fuji Industries Co., Amagasaki Steel Works, and Daido Machinery Co. to manufacture a large number of gasoline bombs with stabilizing fins, worth a total of 3.75 million US dollars. The publication pointed out: "During the continuation of the Kaesong armistice negotiations, this large order has attracted attention from all sides."

    According to the September 12th Yomiuri Shimbun, the U.S. Military Station Command in Japan has "ordered heavy vehicle parts worth a total of 5 million US dollars from four companies, including Komatsu Manufacturing, East Japan Heavy Industries, West Japan Heavy Industries, and Fuji Industries. This batch of vehicles includes bulldozers, tractors, jeeps, and weapon carriers needed by the U.S. military and the newly re-established Japanese army. In the future, these types of vehicles will not be imported from the United States, but will be manufactured directly in Japan for use in Korea and Southeast Asia. Relevant parties believe that this is an important part of 'Japan-U.S. economic cooperation,' and in addition to vehicles, it will inevitably include other military supply departments."

    These facts are further evidence that the United States is preparing to expand its war of aggression in Asia, continue the war of aggression against Korea, and lacks sincerity in the Kaesong negotiations.

    我志愿军在前线又俘获一名日本兵
    被俘日兵供出美军利用日寇进行侵朝战争的非法行为
    美国一面拖延停战谈判一面继续在日本大量制造军火
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社记者报道：美国侵略者利用日本士兵进行侵朝战争的非法行为，又得到了一个新的证明。九月四日，中国人民志愿军在临津江前线长湍地区又俘获在李承晚匪军第一师中充当侦察兵的日本兵安井龙文一名。安井龙文在被俘后化名为车龙文，讲着生硬和不通的朝鲜话，不敢承认自己是日本人。但在中国人民志愿军宽大的俘虏政策的感召下，他终于讲出了自己的经历。
    据安井龙文说：他现年二十四岁，原来住在日本大阪府布施市，在参加侵朝战争以前，是一个失业的缝纫工人。去年九月，在日本的美国占领军当局和日本吉田政府以“大韩民国驻日代表部”的名义，招募了一千多名日本青年，成立所谓“韩国救命义勇队”。安井龙文和其他应募的日本人在去年九月二十五日被调到东京，他们收到发下的美国军服，在美国军人的监视下，经过横滨，运到朝鲜，于去年九月二十九日在仁川港登岸。经过短期训练后，他们从二十人到三十人分批被编入美、李军部队中。包括安井龙文在内的一批二十人被编入番号为第三百三十美军某部。不久又有许多南朝鲜士兵从大邱调来，他们被编为第六十五和第八十五两支部队。安井龙文以后被调到李承晚军第一师。在他所在的侦察队中，一共有二十二个日本兵。
    安井龙文说：据他所知，他们是被美军运到朝鲜的第三批日本兵，前两批共有两千多人。美国占领军当局和日本反动政府并极端无耻地制造文书，以图掩盖他们的非法行为。安井龙文携带有两个证件，一张是大阪府布施市市长盐川正三签发的第五一○二七号“外国人登陆证明书”。另一张是所谓“大韩民国驻日代表部”签发的“大韩民国国民登陆证”。他说：颁发证件的官员在当时曾警告他们：到朝鲜后，不准暴露自己是日本人，也不准再讲日本话。
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：和美帝国主义用各种卑鄙手段拖延开城停战谈判的同时，美国继续利用日本军火工厂制造大量的侵朝杀人武器。据八月二十二日真相特别通信报道，美远东空军司令部八月下旬向日本亚细亚工业公司、埼玉汽车公司、东京煤电公司、富士产业公司、尼崎制钢厂、大日本机械公司等发出了制造大批带安定尾的汽油弹的订单，价值共达三百七十五万美元。该刊指出：“在开城停战谈判继续期间，这批大量定货，正引起各方面的注意。”
    另据九月十二日读卖新闻载称：美驻日兵站司令部已“向日本小松制作所、东日本重工业、西日本重工业、富士工业等四家公司订制共值五百万美元的重型车辆零件。这批车辆包括美军及重新建立的日本新军所需的开路机、拖引车、吉普车、武器搬运车在内。这类车辆今后将不从美国输入，而直接在日本制造，以供朝鲜及东南亚之用。有关方面认为这是‘日美经济合作’的重要一环，除车辆外，必然会包括其他军需部门。”
    这些事实，是美国准备扩大它在亚洲的侵略战争，继续进行侵朝战争及对于开城谈判缺乏诚意的又一明证。
