How Does Cangshan County Use Typical Cases to Promote the Marriage Law?
Lu Ji

In the process of handling the case of young woman Pan's abuse and murder, Cangshan County, Shandong Province, convened a People's Representative Conference, organized a mass meeting to publicly try the murderers Guo Yushan and Qi Songshi, and specifically carried out propaganda and education on the Marriage Law to cadres and the masses.

The county's People's Representative Conference was held on August 28th and 29th. The main content was to use the Pan's abuse and murder case to carry out propaganda and education on the Marriage Law and to examine the implementation of the Marriage Law. A total of 427 representatives attended the conference, including district, township, and village government cadres, as well as representatives from people's organizations and the masses, with men and women each accounting for half. Some of these representatives were women who had suffered serious abuse, some were people who had gained marital freedom through struggle, and a few were cadres or parents with serious feudal ideas who had interfered with marital freedom. At the meeting, the heads of the Cangshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the County People's Government, the Special District Court, and the Democratic Women's Federation respectively explained the main content and spirit of the Marriage Law, introduced the details of Pan's murder, and called on everyone to avenge Pan, to eliminate the remnants of the feudal marriage system, and to establish a new marriage system. Then, in the general assembly discussions and group discussions, they inspired women who had been abused to accuse the evils of the feudal marriage system, which deepened the representatives' hatred of the feudal marriage system. For example, Li Yuqian, a representative from the Eighth District, said: "Parental arrangement and buying and selling marriages are sending one's children into a fire pit. 'Marry a chicken, follow the chicken,' if you are not satisfied, endure it. This is the landlord class consciously creating it to deceive and play with women." After the explanation and accusation, those with feudal ideas realized their mistakes. For example, Wang Hongyi, a representative from the Second District, said: "In the past, I felt that the Marriage Law's provision for freedom of divorce was asking for trouble, breaking up other people's marriages, and I didn't realize that the Marriage Law was for family harmony and production development. After listening to the explanation of the Marriage Law this time, I realized that my past understanding was wrong. I am a newly liberated peasant, and I found a husband for my daughter when she was very young. Her husband's family is a feudal family, they don't give her food or clothing, and they often beat and scold her. My daughter couldn't bear it, and in 1949 she went to the district to ask for a divorce, but the district didn't grant her divorce. At that time, my wife and I both felt: 'We are childhood sweethearts, why divorce?' As a result, not only did the divorce not happen, but her husband's family abused her even more severely and said: 'It doesn't matter if she's beaten to death.' Now my daughter has divorced through struggle, found someone herself, and is doing well. But in the past, I always felt it was shameful. I am still a district cadre. If I don't first dig out my feudal ideas, how can I implement the Marriage Law?"

During the discussion, the representatives exposed many examples of interfering with marital freedom and harming women. Of particular importance was the exposure that the main cadres of fifteen townships and villages still had serious acts of abuse against women, that the county still had one hundred and nineteen child bride issues to be resolved, that ninety-one women were suffering from serious abuse, and that some women might be forced to death; at the same time, they also put forward many exemplary figures in the implementation of the Marriage Law and happy families who handled their marriage problems in accordance with the Marriage Law. All the representatives also held a special discussion on the handling of Pan's abuse and murder case, and unanimously agreed that those who killed women must be severely punished. Finally, all the representatives believed that the key to implementing the Marriage Law in the future was to eliminate the remnants of feudal ideology among cadres, and unanimously passed five resolutions, requiring each representative to strive to become a model for publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law, promoting district and village cadres to study and publicize the Marriage Law, establishing township mediation committees, investigating and mediating unreasonable feudal marriage relationships, and promptly reporting unresolved cases to the higher authorities, and resolutely stopping the phenomenon of persecuting women.

In order to further educate the masses with Pan's murder case, the county held a mass rally on August 30th to publicly try the murderers Guo Yushan and Qi Songshi in the case. Before the meeting, the county organized villages to deliberate and discuss the Pan's abuse and murder case, so the people who attended the meeting were exceptionally crowded. Many women walked more than ten miles of muddy roads and waded through rivers that were waist-deep to attend. According to incomplete statistics, more than 15,000 people participated in the meeting, more than double the expected number. Before the start of the meeting, the county also transferred cadres to explain the comic strips of Pan's murder to the masses who attended the meeting, exposing the evils of the feudal marriage system and publicizing the benefits of the Marriage Law. Therefore, after the public trial began, the entire venue was filled with indignation, and everyone demanded in unison: "Severely punish the murderers!" The County People's Court finally accepted everyone's opinions and sentenced the murderers Guo Yushan and Qi Songshi to death and the village cadre Chen Yongmao and others to prison.

The county's method of using typical cases to vigorously publicize the Marriage Law to the masses has proven to be an effective way to implement the Marriage Law. After the representatives who participated in the People's Representative Conference and the masses who participated in the public trial returned to the village, they generally convened mass forums, and for three or four days, each village was talking about the Pan's murder case. Many cadres and masses who once had feudal backward ideas have realized their mistakes and no longer interfere with their children's freedom of marriage; some women who are being abused have also increased their courage to fight against the feudal marriage system. Gao Hongfeng, the leader of the agricultural association in Shawo Village, automatically guaranteed that no murder cases due to marriage problems would occur in his village in the future. Li Wangshi stopped interfering with her daughter's marriage on the same night she returned from the meeting. Liu Xuewu's daughter-in-law in Kaliuzhuang was severely abused. After being educated at the conference, she complained to the Democratic Women's Federation that night, and three days later went to the District People's Government to ask for a divorce. Her father-in-law admitted his past mistakes and fully agreed to divorce his son. At present, the county's Marriage Law publicity work is being carried out universally in various districts and townships.

Editor's note: The case of Pan's abuse and murder in Cangshan County, Shandong Province, was published on page 3 of this newspaper on September 1st. The brief details of the case are as follows: Pan had no parents or brothers since childhood and had been a child bride to Qi Shoude since she was seven years old. Since Pan married into the family, Qi and his mother often abused her cruelly. Pan was so desperate that she asked for a divorce several times, but her request could not be raised to the District People's Government due to the obstruction of village cadre Chen Yongmao and others. On March 10th of this year, with the mastermind of the village cadre Guo Yushan, and with the participation of Qi and his mother, Pan was brutally beaten to death. The case has been approved by the Linyi Branch of the Shandong Provincial People's Court, sentencing Guo Yushan and Qi Songshi to death, Qi Shoude to fifteen years in prison, and village cadre Chen Yongmao and others to imprisonment. The above judgment has been approved by the East China Branch of the Supreme People's Court.

    苍山县怎样利用典型案件进行婚姻法的宣传？
    鲁绩
    山东省苍山县在处理青年妇女潘氏被虐杀案的过程中，召开了人民代表会议，组织了公审凶手郭玉山和齐宋氏等罪犯的群众大会，具体地向干部和群众进行了婚姻法的宣传教育。
    该县此次人民代表会议是在八月二十八和二十九日召开的，主要内容是通过潘氏被虐杀案进行婚姻法的宣传和教育，并检查婚姻法贯彻执行的情况。这次会议共到代表四百二十七名，包括了区、乡、村政权干部及人民团体和群众的代表，男女各占一半。这些代表中有些就是身受严重虐待的妇女，有些是经过斗争获得婚姻自由的人们，还有少数本身就是有严重封建思想，曾经干涉过婚姻自由的干部或家长。在会议上，中共苍山县委会、县人民政府、专区法院和民主妇女联合会的负责人，分别讲解了婚姻法的主要内容和精神，介绍了潘氏被杀经过，号召大家为潘氏报仇，为肃清封建婚姻制度的残余，建立新的婚姻制度而斗争。然后在大会座谈和小组讨论中，启发曾经受过虐待的妇女控诉封建婚姻制度的罪恶，加深了代表们对封建婚姻制度的痛恨。如八区代表李玉乾说：“父母包办，买卖婚姻，是送自己的儿女进火坑。‘嫁鸡随鸡’，不满意就忍受着，这是地主阶级有意识地制造出来欺骗玩弄妇女的。”经过讲解和控诉后，那些有封建思想的人便认识到了自己的错误。如二区代表王洪义说：“我过去觉得婚姻法上规定离婚自由是没事找事，是拆散人家的姻缘，没有认识到婚姻法是为了家庭和睦、发展生产。这次我听了婚姻法的讲解，才觉得过去的认识不对。我是新翻身的农民，我给我闺女从小就找了婆家。她婆家是个封建家庭，不给她吃穿，还经常打骂她。闺女忍受不住，一九四九年就到区里要求离婚，区里不给她办离婚手续。当时我和我妻都觉得：‘咱是娃娃亲，凭什么离？’这么一来，不但离婚没成，婆家对她虐待得更厉害了，并且说：‘打死也不要紧。’现在俺闺女经过斗争离了婚，自己找了个对象，过得挺好。可是以前我总觉得不光彩。我还是一个区干部，若不先把自己的封建思想挖掉，怎么能去贯彻婚姻法？”
    在讨论中，代表们揭发了许多干涉婚姻自由、摧残妇女的事例。其中特别重要的是揭发了十五个乡和村的主要干部还有严重的虐待妇女的行为，全县尚有一百一十九个童养媳的问题等待处理，九十一个妇女受严重虐待，且有部分妇女可能被逼死；同时也提出了不少执行婚姻法的模范人物及按婚姻法处理自己婚姻问题的幸福家庭。全体代表对潘氏被虐杀案的处理也作了专门讨论，一致认为这种杀害妇女的人一定要受到最严厉的制裁。最后全体代表认为今后贯彻执行婚姻法的重要关键，是肃清干部中的封建残余思想，一致通过了五项决议，要求每个代表都争取成为宣传和执行婚姻法的模范，推动区、村干部学习和宣传婚姻法，并建立乡调解委员会，调查调解不合理的封建婚姻关系，不能解决的应及时向上反映，坚决制止迫害妇女的现象。
    该县为了进一步以潘氏被杀案教育群众，又于八月三十日召开了公审该案杀人凶犯郭玉山和齐宋氏的群众大会。会前，该县就组织各村酝酿讨论了虐杀潘氏案，因而到会的人异常拥挤，许多妇女走了十几里泥泞的路，涉过水深过腰的河沟，也赶来参加。据不完全统计，参加大会的共一万五千多人，超过预计人数一倍以上。大会开始前，该县又抽调干部向到会群众讲解潘氏被杀害的连环画，揭露封建婚姻制度的罪恶，宣传婚姻法的好处。因此公审开始后，全场充满了激愤的情绪，大家都异口同声地要求：“严惩杀人凶犯！”该县人民法院最后接受大家的意见，当场宣判了凶犯郭玉山和齐宋氏的死刑及村干部陈永茂等的徒刑。
    该县利用典型案件大张旗鼓地向群众宣传婚姻法的方法，已经证明是贯彻婚姻法的有效办法。参加人民代表会议的代表和参加公审大会的群众回村以后，一般都召集了群众座谈会，一连三、四天各村都在谈论潘氏被杀案。许多曾经有封建落后思想的干部和群众，已经认识到自己的错误，不再干涉儿女的婚姻自由；有些正遭受虐待的妇女，也增加了向封建婚姻制度斗争的勇气。沙窝村农会组长高洪丰自动保证，他村里今后一定不会因婚姻问题出命案。李王氏在开过会回来的当天晚上，就停止了干涉女儿婚姻的行为。卡刘庄刘学武的儿媳妇受严重虐待，这次受到了大会的教育，当天晚上就到民主妇女联合会诉苦，三天后到区人民政府要求离婚，她公公承认以前的不对，完全赞成同他儿子离婚。目前该县婚姻法的宣传工作正在各区乡普遍进行中。
    编者按：山东省苍山县潘氏被虐杀案已于九月一日本报第三版发表。该案的简要案情如下：潘氏因父母早死，又无兄弟，七岁时便给齐守德当了童养媳。自潘氏过门后，齐氏母子经常对她施行残酷虐待。潘氏被逼得没有办法，曾数次提出离婚，但因村干部陈永茂等的阻挠，她的要求没有能够提到区人民政府。今年三月十日，由村干部郭玉山主谋，齐氏母子参与谋杀，将潘氏残酷毒打致死。该案已经山东省人民法院临沂分院批准，判处郭玉山和齐宋氏死刑，判处齐守德十五年有期徒刑，村干部陈永茂等也分别判处了徒刑。上述判决已经最高人民法院华东分院批准。
