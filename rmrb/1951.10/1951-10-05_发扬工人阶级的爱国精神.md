    Promote the Patriotic Spirit of the Working Class

    In August, Shanghai was hit by a typhoon, and the wharves and warehouses along the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek were severely threatened by flooding. At that time, the vast number of dockworkers (including dock, warehouse, and truck workers) displayed a high degree of patriotism. In the storm, after three days and nights of emergency rescue, they prevented the loss of over 190 billion yuan worth of public and private materials. The situation was very critical when rescuing these materials. However, the Shanghai dockworkers selflessly persisted in their work, bravely fought against the flood, and displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity, overcoming many difficulties as a result. For example, the No. 1 warehouse of the People's Bank was flooded, and the inlet of the water pump was blocked by garbage, preventing it from pumping water. It was necessary to remove the garbage to defeat the raging flood; it was necessary to dive into the pool of water more than ten feet deep to remove the garbage. The situation was very serious at the time. Workers Liu Xunde, Liu Mingde, Lu Heshou, and Lu Jian, in order to protect state property, braved the dangers and took turns diving into the bottom of the pool to retrieve the garbage. Thanks to their efforts, the accumulated water in the warehouse was finally drained, and materials worth more than 36 billion yuan, including cloth, dyes, tobacco leaves, cotton, and western medicines, were rescued. This selfless spirit of labor of the Shanghai dockworkers emerged after the vigorous anti-feudal foreman struggle in the Shanghai port industry. This fact once again proves that the remaining feudal forces pressing down on the workers must be thoroughly eliminated in order to fully unleash the great potential and wisdom of the workers.

    发扬工人阶级的爱国精神
    上海市在八月遭受台风侵袭，黄浦江、苏州河一带的码头仓库，遭受严重的水灾威胁。当时广大搬运工人（包括码头、仓库、卡车工人），发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，在暴风雨中，经过三昼夜紧急抢救，使价值一千九百余亿元的公私物资，避免了损失。在抢救这批物资时，情况是很危急的。但上海市搬运工人忘我地坚持工作，英勇地与洪水搏斗，发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，结果把许多困难都克服了。例如，人民银行第一仓库曾被洪水侵入，当时抽水机的进口被垃圾堵塞，抽不出水；必须去掉这些垃圾，才能战胜汹涌的洪水；必须潜入一丈多深的水池底下，才能去掉这些垃圾。当时情况非常严重。工人刘训德、刘明德、吕鹤寿、卢健等为了保护国家财产，不避艰险，轮流潜入池底，捞取垃圾。由于他们的努力，终将仓库中的积水排除，抢救了价值三百六十多亿元的布匹、颜料、烟叶、棉花、西药等物资。上海搬运工人这种忘我的劳动精神，是在上海搬运业进行了轰轰烈烈地反封建把头斗争后出现的。这一事实再度证明：必须彻底肃清压在工人头上的残余封建势力，才能把工人伟大的潜力与智慧充分发挥出来。
