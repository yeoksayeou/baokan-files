Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 27th. Czechoslovak Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Široký wrote to Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Tan Xilin on October 25th, the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to resist America and aid Korea, to offer congratulations. The letter was published prominently in Czechoslovak newspapers on the 26th. On the 26th, the newspapers also prominently published the congratulatory telegrams from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Chinese People's Volunteers and to General Kim Il-sung. "Labor Daily" also published excerpts of Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association's "Report on the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home and Defend the Country," and "People's Defense" published the "Resolution on Resisting America and Aiding Korea Work" of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Široký's letter stated: Dear Ambassador Comrade:

    With their heroic battles, the Chinese People's Volunteers victoriously repelled the bloody aggression of American imperialism, which invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in order to further invade the Chinese mainland from there. The entire Chinese people, closely united with the heroic volunteer soldiers, launched the Resist America, Aid Korea movement throughout the country. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese people are not only defending the freedom of the Korean people and the sacred borders of the People's Republic of China with their great strength, but are also defending the great cause of world peace. Because only when the imperialist warmongers realize that every aggression against free countries will encounter resistance that will break their heads will they be willing to resolve international issues peacefully through agreements.

    In the armistice negotiations held based on the Soviet Union's proposal, the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the representatives of the Korean People's Army have consistently demonstrated their sincere efforts for peace and a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict. There is no doubt that if it were not for the deliberate sabotage by American imperialists, and if they had shown genuine sincerity for a peaceful resolution, the armistice negotiations could have restored peace to Korea long ago.

    The entire people of Czechoslovakia are concerned about the victorious struggle and firm peaceful efforts of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the entire Chinese people, and sincerely congratulate them on their victory!

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 28th. The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 27th commemorating the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going to Korea to fight.

    The editorial recalled: The Chinese People's Volunteers began going to Korea when MacArthur advanced to the border of Northeast China. The Chinese people became vigilant about a general who boasted of knowing how to "deal with Orientals" rapidly advancing towards their largest industrial center. The Chinese people were not merely imagining that their national security was threatened, just as we would not merely be imagining that our national security was threatened if an enemy force came from six thousand miles away to Mexico and began advancing towards our border.

    The editorial pointed out: "Today, the Chinese and Korean people are doing everything possible to end the terrible slaughter in Korea," while senior leaders of the U.S. government are again talking about expanding the Korean War. The Truman government even boasts that it will never return China's stolen Taiwan to China, nor will it allow the 470 million Chinese people to send representatives to the United Nations.

    The editorial finally urged every patriotic American to exert pressure on the Truman government, demanding that it "stop the delaying tactics in Korea, sign a ceasefire agreement, negotiate with China for peace in Asia, and let all our war-weary men withdraw from the territory of other people's countries."

    捷副总理祝贺我国人民抗美援朝一周年
    纽约“工人日报”号召人民迫使美政府撤退侵朝美军
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】捷克斯洛伐克副总理兼外交部长西罗基，于十月二十五日中国人民志愿军出国抗美援朝一周年纪念日写信给中国驻捷大使谭希林致贺，这封信已于二十六日在捷克斯洛伐克各报以显著地位发表。各报在二十六日还以显著地位刊载了中国共产党中央委员会致中国人民志愿军和致金日成将军的贺电。“劳动报”并摘要刊载了中国人民抗美援朝总会副主席彭真的“关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告”，“人民防线”报刊载了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议“关于抗美援朝工作的决议”。西罗基的信中说：亲爱的大使同志：
    中国人民志愿军以他们英勇的战斗，胜利地击退了侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以便从那里进一步侵略中国大陆的美国帝国主义的血腥侵略。中国全体人民与英勇的志愿军战士紧密地团结在一起，在全国展开了抗美援朝运动。中国人民志愿军和中国人民不仅在以他们巨大的力量保卫着朝鲜人民的自由和中华人民共和国神圣的边疆，同时也在保卫着伟大的世界和平事业。因为帝国主义战争贩子只有在认识到它们对自由国家的每一次侵略都将遭遇到碰得头破血流的抵抗时，才肯通过协议来和平地解决国际问题。
    在根据苏联的倡议而举行的停战谈判中，中国人民志愿军的代表和朝鲜人民军的代表始终不渝地证明了他们为和平和和平解决朝鲜冲突而作的真诚的努力。毫无疑问，如果没有美国帝国主义者的蓄意破坏，如果他们对和平解决表示真正的诚意，停战谈判早可以使朝鲜恢复和平了。
    捷克斯洛伐克全体人民关心着中国人民志愿军和中国全体人民进行的胜利斗争和坚定的和平努力，并衷心祝贺胜利！
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】纽约“工人日报”二十七日发表社论，纪念中国人民志愿军赴朝作战一周年。
    社论追述道：中国人民志愿军是在麦克阿瑟向中国东北边境推进时，开始到朝鲜去的。中国人民对于一个扬言知道如何“对付东方人”的将军迅速向他们最大工业中心推进一事，警惕起来了。中国人民不是仅仅在想像他们国家的安全受到威胁，这就像假如一支敌军从六千哩外来到墨西哥并开始向我国边境推进时，我们不仅仅只是在想像我们国家的安全受到威胁一样。
    社论指出：“今天，中朝人民正在尽一切力量来结束朝鲜境内的可怕屠杀”，而美国政府高级领袖却又在谈论扩大朝鲜战争，杜鲁门政府甚至夸口它永远不把中国被窃取去的台湾归还中国，也不让四亿七千万中国人民派遣代表参加联合国。
    社论最后敦促美国每一个爱国人士对杜鲁门政府施行压力，要求“停止在朝鲜的拖延把戏，签订停火协定，与中国进行谈判以求得亚洲的和平，并让我们厌战的男儿们全部自其他国家人民的领土上撤退。”
