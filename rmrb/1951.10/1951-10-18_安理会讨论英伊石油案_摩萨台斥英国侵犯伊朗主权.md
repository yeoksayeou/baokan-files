Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 16th: According to TASS, the United Nations Security Council met on October 15th, chaired by Muñoz (Brazil), to continue discussing the so-called complaint lodged by the British government regarding Iran's nationalization of oil. British representative Jebb "explained" the new proposal that the delegation had submitted last week to replace the original proposal. The chairman then asked Mossadegh to state Iran's reasons.

Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh said that the Iranian government believes that the Security Council has no right to deal with the complaint filed by the United Kingdom, and he intends to explain the reasons later. He said: "Iran's greatest natural wealth is oil; the extraction of Iranian oil should become our country's industry, and its income should be used to improve our living conditions. But under the current organizational situation, the oil industry actually provides no help whatsoever to the wealth, technological progress, or industrial development of our people." Mossadegh said: If this situation continues, "if foreign exploiters continue to take practically all the profits, our people will forever remain in a state of poverty and hardship." Mossadegh continued: He is "convinced that the Security Council will declare that it itself has no power to deal with this issue."

Mossadegh's speech focused on declaring that Iran's nationalization of the oil industry was an exercise of its sovereignty, and pointed out that the United Nations Charter stipulates that there should be no interference in the internal affairs of member states. He declared that Britain had infringed on Iran's sovereignty. Britain "does not hesitate to violate international law, intending to seize our sovereignty and interfere in Iran's internal affairs on internal affairs issues. Its illegal interference takes many forms."

After Mossadegh's speech, Jebb made a brief speech, and the meeting was adjourned. The next meeting of the Security Council will be held on October 16.

    安理会讨论英伊石油案
    摩萨台斥英国侵犯伊朗主权
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约十六日讯：联合国安全理事会在十月十五日开会，由慕尼兹（巴西）任主席，继续讨论英国政府对于伊朗石油国有化所提出的所谓控诉案。英国代表杰伯“解释”了该代表团上周所提出来代替原来提案的新提案。主席于是要求摩萨台陈述伊朗的理由。
    伊朗首相摩萨台说，伊朗政府认为安理会无权处理联合王国所提出的这项控诉，其理由他打算以后再解释。他说：“伊朗最大的天然财富是石油；伊朗石油的开采理应成为我国的工业，它的收入，应用以改善我们的生活条件。但是照目前的组织情况，石油工业对于我国人民的富裕、技术的进步或工业的发展，实际上丝毫没有帮助。”摩萨台说：如果这种情况继续下去，“如果外国剥削者继续实际上拿走全部收益，我们的人民将永远停留在贫穷和困苦的形态之下”。摩萨台继续说：他“深信安全理事会将宣布它本身没有权力来处理这个问题”。
    摩萨台的发言更着重声明伊朗把石油工业收归国有是行使它的主权，并指出联合国宪章规定不得干涉会员国的内政。他宣称，英国侵犯了伊朗的主权。英国“不惜违反国际法，意图在内政问题上夺取我们的主权，干涉伊朗的内政。它的非法的干涉，方式是多种多样的”。
    在摩萨台发言后，杰伯作简短的发言，会议即告休会，安全理事会下次会议将在十月十六日举行。
