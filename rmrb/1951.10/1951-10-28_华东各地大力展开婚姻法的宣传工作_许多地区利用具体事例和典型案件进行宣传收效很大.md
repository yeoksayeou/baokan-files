East China Vigorously Carries Out Marriage Law Publicity Work
Many Regions Utilize Specific Examples and Typical Cases for Publicity with Great Results

East China is currently vigorously carrying out the publicity work for the Marriage Law.

In many areas of East China, the responsible persons of the People's Governments, CCP Party Committees, and Democratic Women's Federations are using various meetings to explain the Marriage Law to cadres, and issuing circulars about local typical marriage cases and events of cadres violating the Marriage Law, organizing cadres to study. For example, Rudong County (newly established county in the eastern part of Rugao) in northern Jiangsu held a study class for township-level cadres to study the Marriage Law, with cadres from township people's governments, democratic women's federations, and the Communist Youth League participating. In Fujian Province, all levels of cadres throughout the province have listed the study of the Marriage Law as one of the central contents of in-service study for the second half of the year. Chun'an County in Zhejiang Province and Nanjing and other places have discussed problems existing in the implementation of the Marriage Law at meetings of representatives from all walks of life. After participating in the study or discussion of the Marriage Law, cadres and representatives from all walks of life have paid attention to publicizing the Marriage Law to the masses at various gatherings or specially convened forums.

In order to widely spread the publicity of the Marriage Law, various regions have used a variety of publicity methods. The First District People's Government of Shanghang County, Fujian, absorbed the masses to participate in new-style weddings, using examples for publicity. Before National Day, the district people's government held a collective wedding for thirty-three couples, including twelve brides who were widows in the past. The district cadres widely spread this event. In less than ten days after that, more than one hundred couples who freely combined went to the district government to apply for marriage registration. The People's Court of Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, used typical cases to vigorously publicize the Marriage Law. After the court investigated and clarified the cases of husbands abusing wives and fathers-in-law abusing daughters-in-law that occurred locally, it held a public trial attended by more than a thousand people, explaining to the masses the harm of old-style marriages, and publicly announced the death penalty for the murderers. The Central District Tribunal of the Shanghai Municipal People's Court also used the method of circuit trials of marriage cases for publicity. When the tribunal went to Gaoqiao District in the near suburbs last month for circuit trials, it organized nearly a thousand people to attend the trials of marriage cases. Many women who had been victimized by feudal marriages, after seeing the examples of the trials, filed accusations at the meeting, asking the people's government to help them solve the problems existing in their marriages and families.

The marriage problem exhibition halls or publicity rooms held in various places have also achieved results. The Marriage Law Publicity Room held by the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation had 160,000 visitors from October 5th to 15th. The Marriage Law Exhibition in Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province, also had more than 10,000 visitors in the first five days. Many places in Wendeng County, Shandong, also held Marriage Law publicity sheds, which were welcomed by the local people.

In addition, the East China People's Publishing House and the East China Democratic Women's Federation are printing various comic strips, single-page paintings, popular story collections, and mountain song collections with the content of publicizing the Marriage Law. The illustrated explanations of the Marriage Law drawn by the East China People's Publishing House have been published successively in newspapers such as the Jiefang Daily and the Southern Jiangsu Daily. The Education Department of the East China Military and Political Committee has decided to list the Marriage Law as one of the central teaching courses in the rural winter school, and teaching materials are being compiled and printed. This winter, 15 million farmers in East China who attend winter school will be able to learn the Marriage Law.

In order to strengthen the publicity work of the new Marriage Law, the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Women's Work Committee of the East China Bureau invited 15 representatives from relevant organs and groups such as the East China and Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the People's Court, and the Communist Youth League last month to form a Marriage Law Publicity and Research Group, so as to exchange and promote publicity experience in various places in a timely manner and guide the publicity work of the new Marriage Law in various parts of the region.

    华东各地大力展开婚姻法的宣传工作
    许多地区利用具体事例和典型案件进行宣传收效很大
    华东各地正大力展开婚姻法的宣传工作。
    华东不少地区的人民政府、中共党委和民主妇联的负责人利用各种会议向干部讲解婚姻法，并把当地典型的婚姻案件和干部违犯婚姻法的事件发出通报，组织干部进行学习。如苏北如东县（如皋东部新设县）举办了乡级干部学习班，学习婚姻法，参加学习的有乡人民政府、民主妇联和青年团的干部。福建省全省各级干部已将学习婚姻法列为下半年在职学习的中心内容之一。浙江省淳安县和南京等地的各界代表会议上曾讨论了执行婚姻法中存在的问题。各地干部和各界代表会议代表在参加学习或讨论婚姻法后，已注意在各种集会上或专门召开的座谈会上向群众宣传婚姻法。
    为了使婚姻法的宣传广泛地展开。各地运用了多种多样的宣传方法。福建上杭县一区人民政府吸收群众参加新式婚礼，以实例进行了宣传。该区人民政府在国庆节前夕，举行了一次有三十三对男女参加的集体婚礼，其中有十二位新娘过去是寡妇。该区干部并将这件事广泛传播开去。此后不到十天中，该区就有一百多对自由结合的男女到区政府来办结婚登记手续。浙江省淳安县人民法院用典型案件大张旗鼓地来宣传婚姻法。该院把当地发生的丈夫虐杀妻子、公公虐杀媳妇案件调查清楚后，召开了一千多人的公审大会，向群众讲解旧式婚姻的毒害，并当众宣布将杀人凶犯判处死刑。上海市人民法院中区分庭并用巡回审判婚姻案件的方法进行宣传。该分庭在上月到近郊高桥区去巡回审判时，在当地组织了近千人旁听婚姻案件的审判。许多遭受封建婚姻陷害的妇女看到审判的实例后，纷纷在会上提出控诉，要求人民政府帮助她们解决婚姻与家庭中所存在的问题。
    各地举办的婚姻问题展览室或宣传室也收到了效果。上海市民主妇女联合会举办的婚姻法宣传室从十月五日开始至十五日止，观众已有十六万人。浙江省绍兴市的婚姻法展览会在开始的五天中观众也有一万多人。山东文登县也有很多地方举办了婚姻法宣传棚，都受到了当地群众的欢迎。
    此外，华东人民出版社和华东民主妇联正印制多种以宣传婚姻法为内容的连环画、单页画、通俗故事集和山歌集。华东人民出版社绘制的婚姻法图解已陆续在解放日报、苏南日报等报纸上刊登。华东军政委员会教育部并决定把婚姻法列为农村冬学中心教学课程之一，教材正在编印中。华东区今冬将有一千五百万个上冬学的农民可以学到婚姻法。
    为加强新婚姻法的宣传工作，中共中央华东局宣传部与华东局妇女工作委员会已在上月邀集华东及上海市民主妇女联合会、人民法院、青年团等有关机关、团体的代表十五人组成了婚姻法宣传研究小组，以及时交流推广各地宣传经验，指导全区各地关于新婚姻法的宣传工作。
