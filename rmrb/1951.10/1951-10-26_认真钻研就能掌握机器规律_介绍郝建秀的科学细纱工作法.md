    Diligent Research Leads to Mastering Machine Laws
    – Introducing Hao Jianxiu's Scientific Fine Spinning Method –
    Miao Xiangtao
    This summer, a major event occurred in China's cotton textile industry: Hao Jianxiu, a seventeen-year-old fine spinning worker, mastered the laws of machinery and created a set of scientific fine spinning methods. The greatest advantage of the Hao Jianxiu method is that the work is regular, the operation is rationalized, and the roller lapping rate is reduced, thereby increasing production and improving quality. The average roller lapping rate in cotton textile factories across the country is above 1.5%, and some are even as high as 2.7%. Hao Jianxiu's roller lapping rate for seven months was only 0.25%. If the roller lapping rate of cotton textile factories across the country could be reduced to Hao Jianxiu's level, the roller lapping reduced each year could produce at least 44,460 more pieces of yarn. At four yards of cloth per person per year, this could provide clothing for four million people for a year. The state-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, where Hao Jianxiu works, originally had a roller lapping rate of 0.89%. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu method, it was reduced to 0.497%. Even if the national roller lapping rate cannot be reduced to Hao Jianxiu's level, but can be reduced to the level of the Sixth Factory, the annual surplus profit could buy sixty-eight fighter jets for the country. Hao Jianxiu not only created a scientific working method that can generate a large amount of wealth for the country, but also raised a question to workers across the country: once workers master the laws of machinery, labor is no longer a blind action dominated by machines, and production efficiency will be greatly improved. Hao Jianxiu also told everyone that any ordinary liberated worker, as long as they consciously study hard, has the potential to control the machine instead of being blindly controlled by it. Because she is only a seventeen-year-old young female worker with less than two years of work experience.

    Walking into Hao Jianxiu's work area, you will find that her scientific working method is indeed different. In other people's work areas, fluff flies everywhere, but Hao Jianxiu's work area is clean and tidy. Other fine spinning workers run back and forth in the work area, taking care of this and neglecting that, fixing broken ends, and forgetting to change rovings. People are very tired from running around, and the roller lapping comes out in clumps, even as big as walnuts. Hao Jianxiu, however, systematically patrols her work area from right to left, following a certain route, keeping her eyes on the spindles on the right, while also paying attention to all aspects. While wiping the board [1], she orderly joins broken ends, changes rovings, or does other work, always working calmly. She seems to be working quite easily, and the roller lapping is very little. These two situations will immediately make you feel that other workers are being dominated by the machine, and their labor falls into a chaotic passivity; while Hao Jianxiu has mastered the laws of machine operation and arranges her work systematically and proactively. As a result, she does more things but feels relaxed.

    Boldly break through the old operating methods and create a set of scientific fine spinning methods
    The job of a fine spinning worker is to spin roving into yarn. When roving is spun into yarn, it often breaks, just like hand spinning. When it breaks, it must be quickly rejoined, otherwise the roving cannot be spun into yarn and turns into clumps of white cotton, which is called roller lapping. These white cottons need to be reprocessed through the opening [2], carding [3], drawing [4], and then spun into roving [5] before being sent to the fine spinning room. This means that if roller lapping occurs, the labor costs (labor, power consumption, machine wear, etc.) of these previous processes before fine spinning are completely wasted. At the same time, when roller lapping is reused, the fiber structure is also damaged once more during processing. To reduce roller lapping, we must find ways to reduce breaks and quickly rejoin broken ends. In the past, most fine spinning workers stood at the head of the machine or in the middle of the work area, watching the spindles. They went to rejoin the yarn wherever it broke. Apart from trying to speed up the joining action to reduce the release time after the break, no one considered how to rejoin the yarn systematically. Moreover, no one knew how to reduce breaks. Although many people also knew the importance of cleaning, which can reduce breaks, they did not have time to do cleaning work due to the chaos of work and running around in the work area all day long. At the same time, because the so-called "standard working method" in the past stipulated that various cleaning tasks should be done at a certain time, fine spinning workers followed the rules and did them according to the stipulated time. In this way, when doing cleaning work, they could not take care of rejoining the yarn, which made them even more overwhelmed. Sometimes it took more than ten minutes to rejoin the broken yarn, but no one ever tried to change this phenomenon. Hao Jianxiu boldly broke the old standard operating methods and the old ways of general fine spinning workers. She works systematically, patrolling her work area from right to left in a systematic way, combining several tasks and completing them in stages during the patrol. While patrolling, she wipes the clearer board [6] with her right hand, and sweeps the floor with a broom in her left hand when necessary. When she needs to transport bobbins or roving, she does it along the way. When she sees a break, she stops to rejoin it. She needs about two minutes and thirty seconds to patrol once, so her breaks can generally be rejoined within two minutes. What others have to complete several times, she completes in one patrol. This saves time and allows more cleaning work to be done. This method of doing cleaning work at any time can not only save time and do more cleaning work, but also avoid delaying rejoining and changing yarn due to doing cleaning work. Because she can proactively grasp the situation, she does more cleaning work when there are fewer breaks, and less cleaning work when there are more breaks. As a result, it reduces breaks and shortens the release time after breaks. Hao Jianxiu not only works systematically and planned, but also strives for rationality and saves time for every small action. She humbly learns the operational advantages of veteran workers, concentrates and develops these advantages, and improves or abandons the bad ones. Therefore, her operation method is more scientific than the original practice. When the Hao Jianxiu method was first promoted, many veteran workers were unconvinced. Some people said that their years of service were longer than her age, and they could work better even with their toes. However, after learning the Hao Jianxiu method, the veteran workers were convinced and said: "After learning the Hao Jianxiu method, I realized that I had been running around for nothing for the past ten or twenty years." Research every small problem in the work
    Why can't others find the laws of machinery and create a set of scientific working methods after working in the fine spinning room for ten or twenty years, but only Hao Jianxiu can? The problem lies in the fact that Hao Jianxiu studies every small problem in the work with a high sense of responsibility as a master. Hao Jianxiu has no secrets. She just painstakingly explores tricks in her own practice. On the first night shift after the Spring Festival in 1950, it was Hao Jianxiu's turn to be on duty. This day was her first day as a formal worker after being a trainee. She was playful during the day and dozed off at night, releasing a lot of white cotton, and was criticized by everyone. This was a great stimulus to a young female worker who was not yet sixteen years old. A high sense of responsibility blamed her. She made up her mind: "I must rejoin the ends well, and never let it release cotton again." How can I not release cotton? My rejoining skill is not good either. So she thought: "I will not leave the work area and see if you release cotton or not." In the work area, she concentrated on rejoining the ends whenever they broke. However, the ends were always not rejoined, and the roller lapping could not be reduced. She repeatedly thought: "Why does the yarn break so often?" "It's not a solution to keep rejoining the ends like this. What should I do?" She paid attention to the operation of the spindles and found that the ends broke more often when there was more flying cotton on the machine. So she thought: "If there is less fluff and the machine is cleaner, it will definitely reduce breaks." She did this, and it really worked. This was a great encouragement to her. The old standard operating method stipulates that all cleaning tasks should be done within a certain time. Hao Jianxiu boldly broke through this obstacle and decided to do more cleaning work. Wiping the clearer board became her regular work. While wiping the clearer board, she found that following the route taken by the clearer board, from right to left, while patrolling and doing work, she could avoid running around aimlessly. In this way, she discovered the patrol law. During the patrol, she also studied carefully, bit by bit, and calculated carefully, combining various tasks and completing them in stages during the patrol. During the Red May Competition, the factory established a system of weighing individual roller lapping, and Hao Jianxiu's roller lapping was the least in the factory. The factory leaders praised her for uniting everyone to do the work well. Backward workers were jealous of her and attacked her, saying that she was "hiding the white cotton, playing tricks," and everyone ignored her. At this time, the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League in the factory gave her help and support, which further improved her awareness. She understood that reducing roller lapping can create wealth for the country. She answered other people's attacks with humility and unity. She thought: "The master should not stop doing it because others attack him. Since it is for the country, I cannot only do it myself, but I must unite everyone, otherwise, what is the use of reducing my own roller lapping by an ounce or two?" She also thought: "Veteran workers are not like myself, who have lived a good life as soon as they entered the factory. They have been infected with this conservative thinking in the old society, so I cannot blame them. I am young and my skills are not good, so I must learn more from everyone." Under the control of such a noble wish, she broke through this difficulty. She took the initiative to unite the veteran workers and humbly learned skills from them. Hao Jianxiu quickly united well with everyone and absorbed the experience of the veteran workers, enriching her working methods. Last October, she honorably became a member of the Youth League. With the specific help of the League, she continued to study hard and made her working methods more complete. Finally, she created a new record of 0.25% roller lapping in seven months.

    Note:
    [1] Clearer board: a kind of cleaning tool. Wiping the clearer board can remove the flying cotton on the leaf board, so that no flying cotton will blow onto the yarn.
    [2] Opening: the first process of spinning. After the cotton enters the factory, the opening machine loosens the tightly pressed cotton bales, removes impurities, and makes uniform cotton laps.
    [3] Carding: The cotton lap is processed by the carding machine (also called a steel wire machine) to remove short fibers and make cotton slivers.
    [4] Drawing: The cotton slivers made by the carding machine are not uniform enough. These slivers are combined by the drawing machine to make them uniform cotton slivers.
    [5] Roving: It is to draw the cotton sliver into thinner roving.
    [6] Leaf board: A part on the fine spinning machine, the yarn has to pass near it.

    认真钻研就能掌握机器规律
    ——介绍郝建秀的科学细纱工作法——
    缪祥焘
    今年夏天，我国棉纺织业中发生了一件大事：十七岁的细纱女工郝建秀掌握了机器的规律，创造了一套科学的细纱工作法。郝建秀工作法的最大好处是工作有规律，操作合理化，皮辊花减少，因而产量增加，质量提高。全国各棉纺织厂的皮辊花率平均在百分之一点五以上，甚至有高达百分之二点七的。郝建秀七个月的皮辊花率却只有百分之零点二五。假若全国各棉纺织厂的皮辊花率都能降低到郝建秀的水平，则每年少出的皮辊花，至少可以多生产四万四千四百六十件纱，以每人每年用布四丈计，可供四百万人一年的衣料。郝建秀所在的国营青岛第六棉纺织厂原来的皮辊花率是百分之零点八九，推广郝建秀工作法以后，降低为百分之零点四九七。全国的皮辊花率即使不能降低到郝建秀的水平，而能降低到六厂的水平，一年的超额利润便可为国家购买六十八架战斗机。郝建秀不但创造了这样一个可以为国家增殖大量财富的科学工作法，还向全国工人提出一个问题：机器的规律一被工人掌握，劳动就不再是被机器支配的盲目动作，生产效率就会大大提高。郝建秀还告诉了大家，解放了的任何一个普通工人只要自觉地用心钻研，都有可能去支配机器而不再盲目地受机器支配。因为她自己才不过是一个工龄还不满二年的十七岁的青年女工。
    一走进郝建秀的车档，你就会发现她的科学的工作方法确实与众不同。别人的车档里花毛乱飞，郝建秀的车档里却是清清爽爽，别的细纱工人在车档里来回乱跑，顾上这里顾不上那里，接了头，顾不了换粗纱。人跑得非常疲劳，皮辊花出得一团一团地，甚至大得像核桃一样。郝建秀却是有规律地自右向左，依着一定的路线在车档里巡回着眼睛注视着右边的纱锭，同时兼顾各方面。一面打着擦板〔一〕，一面有次序地接着断头、换粗纱，或者做其他活，总是不慌不忙地工作。看起来工作怪轻松的，而皮辊花出得很少。这两种情况，立刻就会使你感觉到，别的工人是被机器支配着，劳动陷于忙乱被动；而郝建秀则是掌握了机器操作的规律，有计划地主动地把工作按排得有条有理。因此多做了事情，反而觉得轻松。
    大胆地突破旧的操作法，创造一套科学的细纱工作法
    细纱工人的工作是把粗纱纺成细纱。粗纱纺成细纱时，也像手工纺纱一样经常会断头，断了头要赶快接上，不然粗纱就纺不成细纱，变成了一团团的白花，即所谓皮辊花。这些白花需要重新经过清花〔二〕、梳棉〔三〕、并条〔四〕、再纺成粗纱〔五〕而后送到细纱间来。这就是说，出了皮辊花就要把细纱以前的这几道工序的工缴费用（人工、动力消耗、机器的损耗等）完全浪费掉。同时皮辊花再用时，又经一次制做，纤维的组织也要遭到损伤。要想少出皮辊花，就得设法减少断头，断了头要立刻接上。过去一般细纱工人，大都是站在车头或车档中间，眼看着锭子，那里断了头就去那里接，除了想法使接头的动作快一点以减少断头后的放花时间外，谁也不考虑怎样有规律地接头。更不知道怎样去减少断头。虽然许多人也都知道清洁工作的重要，可以减少断头，但是由于工作的忙乱，成天的在车档内东跑西转，没有时间去做清洁工作。同时由于过去所谓“标准工作法”把各种清洁工作规定在一定的时间来做，细纱工人们也就墨守成规按照规定时间去做。这样，做清洁工作时，就顾不上接头，更加弄得顾此失彼，有时断了头要超过十分钟以上才能接上，可是谁也不曾企图改变这种现象。郝建秀却大胆地打破了旧的标准操作法和一般细纱工人的老一套的作法。她有规律地进行工作，有规律地自右向左在车档内巡回，把几种工作结合起来在巡回中分次做完。巡回时，他右手打着擦板结线叶子板〔六〕，需要扫地时左手就拿着扫帚扫地，需要运木管，运粗纱时就附带运去，看见断头时，就停下来接头。她巡回一次，需二分三十秒左右，所以她的断头一般都可在两分钟内接上。别人要几次完成的工作。她在一次巡回中就做完了。节省了时间，可以多做清洁工作。这种随时做清洁工作的办法，既可以节省时间多做清洁工作，又不致因做清洁工作而耽误了接头和换纱。因为她可以主动地掌握情况，断头少时多做清洁工作，断头多时少做清洁工作，结果是减少了断头，又缩短了断头后放花时间。郝建秀不但有规律有计划地工作，并且对每一个细小的动作都求得既合理又节省时间。她虚心地学习老工人们操作上的优点，并把这些优点集中起来加以发扬；不好的地方则加以改进或舍弃。因此她的操作方法比原先的作法更为科学。在开始推广郝建秀工作法时，有不少老工人不服气，有人说我的工龄比她的年龄还大，用脚指头也比她工作得好，可是学习了郝建秀工作法后，老工人们服气了，说：“学了郝建秀工作法，才知道过去白跑了一二十年的冤枉腿。”钻研工作中每一个细小问题
    为什么别人在细纱间工作了十年二十年，不能发现机器的规律，创造出一套科学的工作法而唯独郝建秀能够呢？问题就在于郝建秀是以主人翁的高度负责态度去钻研工作中的每一个细小问题。郝建秀并没有什么秘诀，她只是在自己的实践中刻苦地摸索窍门。一九五○年春节后的第一个夜班，正逢郝建秀值班，这一天正是她由养成工改为正式工的第一天。她白天里贪玩，夜里打盹，放了很多白花，受了大家的批评。这对一个不满十六岁青年女工是一个很大的刺激。高度的责任心责备着她。她下了决心：“一定要把头接好，再不叫它放花。”怎样才能不放花呢？自己的接头技术又不好。于是她想：“我就不出车档，看你放花不放花。”在车档里，她集中精力断了头就接。可是头总是接不完，皮辊花也少出不了。她反复地想：“为什么纱老断头呢？”“老这样断了头就接也不是办法。怎么办呢？”她注意了锭子运转的情况，发现了车上飞花多时，头就断得多。于是她想：“如果花毛少一点，车子干净点，一定可以减少断头。”她这样做了，果然生效。这对她是一个很大的鼓励。旧的标准操作法把各项清洁工作都规定在一定时间内做，郝建秀大胆地冲破这个障碍，决心多做清洁工作。打擦板成了她的经常工作。在打擦板中，她又发现了依照擦板所走的路线，自右向左，一边巡回，一边做工作，就可以不乱跑。这样她就发现了巡回规律。在巡回当中，她同样的一点点的用心钻研，仔细计算，把各种工作都结合在巡回中分次做完。到了红五月竞赛时，厂里建立了个人皮辊花的过磅制度，郝建秀的皮辊花在全厂是最少的。团结大家把工作做好厂里领导干部表扬了她。落后的工人却嫉妒她打击她，说她是“藏了白花，耍鬼”大家都不理她。这时候，工厂内的党、行政、工会、青年团都给她以帮助和支持，使她的觉悟更提高一步。她懂得了少出皮辊花就能够为国家创造财富，她以虚心和团结去回答别人的打击。她想：“主人翁不能因为别人一打击就不干了。既是为国家，就不能只自己干，就得团结大家，不然，就是自己的皮辊花少出到一两又有多大用处？”她又想到：“老工友们不像自己，一进厂就过到好日子，她们在旧社会里染上这种保守思想，不能怪她们。自己年纪小，技术不好，得多向大家学习。”在这样一个崇高的愿望支配下，她打破了这个难关。她主动地团结了老工友，虚心地向她们学习技术。郝建秀很快地就和大家团结得很好，并且吸取了老工友的经验，充实了自己的工作方法。去年十月，她光荣地成为一个青年团员。在团的具体帮助下，她继续钻研，使自己的工作法更趋完整，终于创造了七个月皮辊花百分之零点二五的新纪录。
    注：
    〔一〕擦板：是一种清洁工具。打擦板，就可以把叶子板上的飞花清除掉，这样就不会有飞花吹到纱上去。
    〔二〕清花：是纺纱的第一道工程。棉花进厂后，经过清花机把棉包内紧压的棉花打松，清除杂质，制成均匀的棉卷。
    〔三〕梳棉：棉卷经过梳棉机（也叫钢丝车）的分梳作用，清除短纤维，制成棉条。
    〔四〕并条：梳棉机制成的棉条不够均匀，把这些条子经过并条机加以并合，使之成为均匀的棉条。
    〔五〕粗纱：是把棉条拉成较细的粗纱。
    〔六〕叶子板：细纱机上的一项零件，纱要在它附近经过。
