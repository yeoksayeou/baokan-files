Letter to the Editor:

    We are students of the Beijing Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle School. Since enrolling, we have felt that the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has not given enough attention to workers' and peasants' education. We are now telling you the facts we know:

    Our school was established last year. After the first enrollment work, the school was unable to start classes for a long time due to the lack of school buildings, which affected the teaching progress. Later, although there were school buildings, they were still extremely small, and the school's sanitation work was not done well, so that students often got sick. This year's summer enrollment matters have not yet been held due to the limitations of school buildings. The Bureau of Culture and Education stated that if no housing can be found, the enrollment work must wait until the new school building is completed. However, the new school building will take at least two months to complete. In this way, it will not be easy to grasp the teaching progress of new students and the direct promotion of preparatory class students to formal classes. We have asked the Bureau of Culture and Education for instructions on this issue several times, but to no avail.

    This summer, there was a change in the school's faculty and staff. Our school asked the Bureau of Culture and Education to allocate teachers very early, but until now, there is still a lack of a Dean of Studies and a modern history teacher; one mathematics teacher is still temporarily acting; when our school again asked the Bureau of Culture and Education to hire more teachers, the comrades of the Bureau of Culture and Education actually took out a list of unemployed intellectuals in Beijing and said, "Choose from here!" When we asked them whether they could complete the task of workers' and peasants' education, these comrades said, "Workers and peasants have low cultural levels, just get someone who can teach characters." This is an irresponsible attitude. Secondly, the school hired an illiterate person as an administrator. He not only failed to manage the food well, but also lost 7,000 catties of millet in five months. The above problems have been reported to the Bureau of Culture and Education more than twenty times, but no appropriate solution has been received.

    In February of this year, our school received a notice from the Bureau of Culture and Education regarding student welfare funds and that students on the supply system should still receive fees according to the supply treatment, but when going to the Bureau of Culture and Education to collect the money, it was not issued, the reason being that the female comrade who was originally in charge of welfare work was resting due to childbirth, and the acting person was not familiar with the business. Also, our school has twelve students transferred from the army. According to the notice, they should restore the military treatment, but the Bureau of Culture and Education believes that their number is small, and it would be too troublesome to restore the original treatment. The above two issues have not been resolved until now.

    We believe that it is inappropriate for the Bureau of Culture and Education to treat workers' and peasants' education work with this attitude, and we hope to check it.

### 北京市文教局对工农教育工作不够重视

    北京市文教局对工农教育工作不够重视编辑同志：
    我们是北京市工农速成中学的学生。入学以来，我们感到北京市文教局对工农教育，并未予以足够的重视。今将我们所知道的事实告诉你们：
    我们的学校是在去年开办的。学校在首次招生工作结束后，即因没有校舍，迟迟未能开课，影响了教学进度；后来虽然有了校舍，可是仍然异常狭小，而且学校卫生工作又做得不好，以致同学们经常生病。今年暑期招生事宜，又因为校舍的限制，迄今尚未举行。文教局表示：如果找不到房子，招生工作就必须等新校舍完工后再说。可是新校舍完工至少也得两个月。这样，新生与本校预备班直升正式班的教学进度就不容易掌握了。这个问题，我们曾数次向文教局请示，但无结果。
    今年暑期，学校教职员有所调动，我们学校很早就请示文教局要求配备教员，但开学到现在，还缺教导主任和一位近代史教员；有一位数学教员还是暂时代理的；当我们学校再次请示文教局，要求增聘教员时，文教局的同志竟把北京市失业知识分子的名单拿出来说：“你们挑选吧！”我们问他们能不能完成工农教育的任务时，这些同志说：“工农分子文化低，去个教字的就行了。”这是不负责任的态度。其次，学校聘用了一位不识字的人当管理员，他不但办不好伙食，而且在五个月中亏损了七千斤小米。以上问题曾向文教局作过二十几次的报告，均未得到适当的解决。
    今年二月，我们学校接到文教局关于学生福利费和供给制学生仍按供给待遇领取费用的通知，但到文教局领款时，又不发给了，其理由是原管理福利工作的女同志因生产休息了，代理人对业务不熟习。又我校有十二名由部队转送来的学生，按通知应恢复部队待遇，但文教局认为他们人数少，如恢复原来待遇那就太麻烦了。以上两个问题直到现在还没有得到解决。
    我们认为，文教局用这种态度来对待工农教育工作是不妥当的，希望检查一下。周玉亭  郭  琳王立仁  贾毅生
