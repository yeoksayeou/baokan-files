Farmers in Maqiao Village, Nantong County, Northern Jiangsu, have subscribed to patriotic cotton sales plans household by household. In the twenty days before the end of September, the village organized five collective cotton sales, selling more than 24,000 jin of seed cotton, averaging more than 33 jin per mu of cotton field. They achieved the goal of selling as much as they picked from the fields to the cooperative.

The cotton purchasing situation in Maqiao Village was similar to the initial cotton purchasing situation in many cotton-producing areas in East China: although a large amount of cotton matured after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the amount on the market did not increase much. This was because farmers were not in a hurry to use money after the festival and were also busy harvesting rice, so they could not spare time to sell cotton. More importantly, cadres believed that purchasing and storing new cotton was much easier than purchasing and storing old cotton, and they were satisfied with the enthusiastic cotton sales by cotton farmers during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Although the village's eleven farmers' association groups had all signed patriotic pledges, they only generally mentioned "guaranteeing to sell cotton to the state" and did not specifically guarantee quick picking and quick sales. After discovering this situation, the township cotton sales committee held a central cotton sales group meeting in the village, composed of village cadres and cotton farmer representatives, to lead everyone in reviewing their blindly optimistic ideas and researching the key to launching the village's cotton sales campaign, which lay in further in-depth patriotic propaganda and education, mobilizing the masses to transform the patriotic pledges into household cotton sales plans, and helping the masses solve the practical difficulties of quickly picking and selling cotton while harvesting rice. The meeting calculated how much cotton should be picked per mu of cotton field by the end of September and determined that the village's cotton sales plan before the end of September should be at least an average of 30 jin per mu.

After this meeting, more than 30 cadres, Communist Party members, Youth League members, and cotton farmer activists in the village were assigned to help five or six households each to formulate patriotic cotton sales plans. A campaign to formulate plans household by household quickly unfolded throughout the village. Cotton farmers who sold less cotton, after patriotic education and enlightenment, generally realized that truly fulfilling the patriotic pledge meant selling the picked cotton to the state as soon as possible to support the cotton textile factory in quickly working overtime to produce. Shi Guiyuan, a middle peasant in the village in his fifties, had seven mu of cotton fields and had picked more than 150 jin of cotton at that time, but only sold more than 30 jin; after persuasion and mobilization, he consciously made a plan to sell 200 jin of cotton by the end of September, and by the end of the month, he had sold more than 20 jin more than the original plan.

In order to ensure the completion of the patriotic cotton sales plan, the cotton farmers organized mutual aid to solve the difficulty of harvesting rice and selling cotton at the same time; in particular, they mobilized women to universally participate in the cotton sales campaign: men harvested rice and ginned cotton, while women picked and sorted cotton, some getting up early to harvest rice and pull up soybeans, and hurrying to pick cotton in the afternoon. The village's six cotton gins only stopped for a few hours after midnight, and started up again before dawn. Therefore, the amount of cotton sold increased greatly. From September 20th to 30th, the village sold more than 19,000 jin of cotton, four times more than in the previous ten days. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 苏北南通县马桥村农民  家家户户订售棉计划

    苏北南通县马桥村农民
    家家户户订售棉计划
    苏北南通县马桥村农民家家户户订立爱国售棉计划。在九月底以前的二十天中，该村组织了五次集体售棉，共售出籽棉二万四千多斤，平均每亩棉田售出三十三斤以上，做到田里摘起多少，就售给合作社多少。
    马桥村的购棉情况和华东许多棉区的初期购棉情况相似：中秋节后棉花虽然大量成熟，但上市量却并没有增加多少。这是因为农民过了节不急于要钱用，同时又要忙于收割稻谷，顾不上售棉。更重要的是，干部认为购储新棉要比购储存棉容易得多，满足于中秋节时棉农售棉较踊跃的现象。村里十一个农会小组虽然都订了爱国公约，但只是一般地提到“保证把棉花售给国家”，没有具体保证快摘快售。乡里售棉委员会发现这种情况后，就在村里召开村干部和棉农代表组成的售棉中心小组会议，领导大家检讨盲目乐观思想，并研究出搞开本村售棉运动的关键在于进一步深入爱国主义宣传教育，发动群众把爱国公约化为家家户户的售棉计划，并帮助群众解决既要迅速摘棉售棉又要收好稻谷的实际困难。会上计算出到九月底每亩棉田应该摘起多少棉花，确定全村九月底前的售棉计划为至少平均每亩三十斤。
    经过这次会议以后，全村干部、中共党员、青年团员和棉农积极分子三十多人，每人分工负责帮助五、六家农户订立爱国售棉计划。全村迅速展开了家家户户订计划的运动。售棉较少的农户，经过爱国主义的教育启发，普遍认识到：真正做到尽快地把所摘棉花售给国家，支援棉纺厂迅速加班生产，才算执行爱国公约。村里一个五十多岁的中农施桂元种有七亩棉田，当时已摘了一百五十多斤棉花，但只售出三十多斤；经过说服动员后，他自觉地订出了九月底售棉二百斤的计划，到月底时，还比原订计划多售出了二十多斤。
    棉农们为了保证完成爱国售棉计划，组织了互助伴工来解决同时收谷、售棉的困难；特别是发动了妇女普遍投入售棉运动：男人割稻轧花，女人摘花拣花，有的起早割稻拔豆，下午赶紧摘花。全村六部轧花车半夜后只停几个钟头，天不亮又开了车。因此售棉数量大大增加。全村在九月二十日至三十日这十天中，出售棉花一万九千多斤，比前十天增加了四倍。（新华社）
