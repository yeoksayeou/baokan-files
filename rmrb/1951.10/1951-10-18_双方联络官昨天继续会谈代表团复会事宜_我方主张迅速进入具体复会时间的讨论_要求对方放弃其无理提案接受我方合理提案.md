    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th] The liaison officers of both sides continued talks on October 17th to discuss the resumption of meetings by both delegations. The meeting began at 10:00 AM, adjourned at 11:40 AM, and resumed at 3:00 PM, ending at 4:49 PM. Our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, reiterated at the meeting on October 17th that the liaison officers of both sides should swiftly enter into discussions on the specific date and time for the resumption of meetings by both delegations, so as to promptly restore the armistice negotiation conference. As for the issue of the scope of the neutral zone during the entire armistice negotiation period, the liaison officers of both sides can simultaneously submit the different proposals from both sides to the first meeting of both delegations after the resumption for negotiation and decision. Colonel Zhang Chunshan pointed out that if the scope of the Kaesong and Munsan neutral zones is reduced to a circular area with a radius of 3,000 yards according to the proposal put forward by the other side, and no provisions are made for both sides of the roads between Panmunjom and Kaesong and Munsan, then the locations where hostile actions may occur will be closer to the meeting venue and delegation residences, as well as the roads that the delegation must take to attend meetings, thus making it even more impossible to guarantee the smooth progress of the negotiation conference. Colonel Zhangshan further pointed out: In order for a neutral zone to truly play a role in ensuring the smooth progress of negotiations and to be easily identified and respected by the combat troops of both sides, the scope of the neutral zone should have an appropriate area and should not be reduced to the point where it cannot perform its due role. Regarding the unreasonable reservation put forward by the other side's liaison officer that the other side's military aircraft may freely fly into the airspace above the neutral zone without being restricted by the neutral zone, Colonel Zhang Chunshan sternly refuted it, pointing out that this attempt to use the neutral zone's regulations only to restrain our side while evading its own responsibility is the main reason why incidents of violating the neutral zone agreement have occurred in the past. Finally, Colonel Zhang Chunshan demanded that the other side abandon its unreasonable proposals and seriously consider and accept our reasonable proposals, so that the meeting of the liaison officers of both sides can quickly enter into discussions on the specific date and time for the resumption of meetings by both delegations, in order to facilitate the rapid resumption of the armistice negotiation conference.

    双方联络官昨天继续会谈代表团复会事宜
    我方主张迅速进入具体复会时间的讨论
    要求对方放弃其无理提案接受我方合理提案
    【新华社开城十七日电】十月十七日双方联络官继续会谈，协商双方代表团复会事宜。会议在上午十时开始，十一时四十分休会，下午三时继续举行，四时四十九分结束。我方联络官张春山上校在十月十七日的会上再度要求双方联络官应迅速进入双方代表团具体复会日期与时间的讨论，以便使停战谈判会议迅速恢复。至于整个停战谈判期间的中立区范围的问题，双方联络官可以将双方不同的方案同时提交双方代表团在复会后第一次会议上协商决定。张春山上校指出：如果依照对方所提出的方案将开城和汶山中立区的范围缩小至半径三千码的圆形区域，并且对板门店和开城、汶山间通道的两侧地区不加任何规定，则可能发生敌对行为的地点将更加接近于会场和代表团住所以及代表团赴会时所必经的道路，从而谈判会议的顺利进行将更加无从予以保障。张春山上校更指出：为使一个中立区确能发生保障谈判顺利进行的作用，并易为双方作战部队所辨识和尊重，中立区的范围就应有适当的面积，而不应该缩小到不能发生其应有作用的地步。对于对方联络官所提出的对方军用飞机可以不受中立区的约束，而任意飞入中立区上空的无理保留，张春山上校严词予以驳斥，指出：这种将中立区的规定仅来约束我方而逃避本身责任的企图，正是以往破坏中立区协议的事件所以发生的主要原因。最后，张春山上校要求对方放弃其无理提案而郑重考虑并接受我方的合理提案，使双方联络官的会议可以迅速进入双方代表团具体复会日期和时间的讨论，以便于停战谈判会议的迅速恢复。
