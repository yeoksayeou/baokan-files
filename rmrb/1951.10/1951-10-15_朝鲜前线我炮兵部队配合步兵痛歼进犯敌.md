Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 14th: Our frontline reporter reports: In the recent counterattack battles in the western part of the central front and the eastern part of the western front, the artillery units of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army continuously and fiercely shelled the invading American and ROK troops. In the battle for an unnamed high ground between Yeyue Mountain and Tiande Mountain, west of Tieyuan, our artillery unit, in coordination with the infantry, killed and wounded several hundred enemy soldiers and destroyed several of their tanks. The artillery units also used long-range fire to destroy newly built bunkers on the enemy's positions and bombard enemy assembly points. On September 30th, more than two hundred enemy soldiers and eight vehicles gathered at a fork in the road four kilometers northwest of Tieyuan. Our artillery unit immediately launched a devastating bombardment, with a chain of shells hitting the target every time. The vehicles immediately caught fire. Most of the enemies were badly burned, suffering heavy casualties. In other areas, the enemy's attacking troops, reserve troops, and tank units also continuously suffered heavy casualties from our army's strong artillery fire.

    朝鲜前线我炮兵部队配合步兵痛歼进犯敌
    【新华社朝鲜前线十四日电】本社前线记者报道：在最近中线西部和西线东部地区的阻击战中，朝中人民军队的炮兵部队在配合步兵作战中连续以猛烈炮火痛击美、李进犯军。仅在铁原以西夜月山与天德山之间一个无名高地的战斗中，我军某部炮兵即配合步兵杀伤了数百名敌军，并击毁其多辆战车。各部炮兵并以远程射击摧毁敌军阵地上新筑的地堡和轰击敌军的集结地点。九月三十日，在铁原西北四公里处的岔道上集结了两百多名敌军和八辆汽车。我军某部炮兵当即向其进行毁灭性的轰击，联珠般的炮弹发发命中目标。汽车立即被打得起火。大部分敌人被打得焦头烂额，死伤惨重。在其他各处敌军的进攻部队、后备部队和战车队，也不断地遭到我军强烈炮火的严重杀伤。
