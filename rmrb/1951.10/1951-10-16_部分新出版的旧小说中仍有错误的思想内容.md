    Some Newly Published Old Novels Still Contain Erroneous Ideological Content
    To the Editor:
    In a book rental store on Yanjiang Avenue in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, I saw that some of the books rented out by the store were old comic strips, and others were old novels. Many of those old novels were published between March and May 1951, and their content was either very bizarre, or promoted pornography and superstition, or directly contradicted the government's policies. For example, "The Storms of the Miao Border" (published in March 1951 by Shanghai Zhenghua Bookstore) describes the martial arts of the Miao people. However, the author begins by writing: "The Miao people, formerly known as the Southern Yi, are by nature barbaric, culturally backward, and far inferior to the Han people in every way. They are divided into raw Miao and cooked Miao, with the raw Miao being the same as the Luoluo, who eat people..." This is obviously insulting ethnic minorities and promoting Han chauvinism. Most of these books are rented and read by children and women, which is very harmful to them. These books are published in Shanghai, and since they have been published, I think the harm must be more than just in Shanghai. Our Huangshi City has these books. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant authorities in the East China region strengthen the leadership and inspection of the publishing industry, and I hope that readers everywhere will severely criticize books that spread harmful ideas and reactionary content.

### 部分新出版的旧小说中仍有错误的思想内容

专栏：读者来信

    部分新出版的旧小说中仍有错误的思想内容编辑同志：
    我在湖北黄石市沿江大道的一个租书店里，看到该店出租的书中，有一部分是旧连环图画，另一部分是旧小说。那些旧小说有许多是一九五一年三月至五月出版的，其内容有的是非常怪诞，有的是宣传色情、迷信的，有的直接与政府的政策相抵触。如“苗疆风云”（一九五一年三月上海正华书局出版）是描写苗族人民的拳术的。但作者开头写道：“苗人，古称南夷，性蛮悍，文化落后，一切远逊汉人。有生苗、熟苗之分，生苗即猓猓，吃人……”这显然是侮辱少数民族，宣传大汉族主义的。这种书多数是儿童和妇女租着看，对他们害处非常大。这些书是上海出版的，既已出版，我想为害一定不止上海一处。像我们黄石市就有这些书。所以，我建议华东区有关机关对出版业加强领导与检查，并望各地读者对传播有害思想和反动内容的书加以严厉批评。
