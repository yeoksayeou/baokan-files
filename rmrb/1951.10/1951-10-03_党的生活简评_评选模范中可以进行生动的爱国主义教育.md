    Party Life Brief Commentary
    Lively Patriotic Education Can Be Conducted in the Selection of Models
    In many villages in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, peasants conducted mutual patriotic education when comparing crops and electing models before the autumn harvest. For example, peasants in the first district of Jize County, Hebei, proposed "loving the motherland, responding to the call of superiors, participating in mutual aid, growing crops well, and being creative in farming techniques" as the criteria for winning in the competition. In Ximatou Village, Daming County, when comparing crops, peasant Pei Liqin's cotton grew tall, and he felt he could be a model; however, he was defeated when compared with peasant Pei Xingchen. The peasants commented: "Pei Xingchen acts in accordance with the state's plans in everything. When the Party and the People's Government issue a call, he is the first to act. In the spring, he took the lead in implementing the patriotic pact, planting ten mu of cotton, and led us to complete the cotton planting plan. He pays attention to technology in cultivation. Each cotton plant has twenty large bolls, and each mu can produce six hundred to six hundred and fifty catties. Pei Liqin was only afraid of losing money by planting cotton, so he only planted three mu; he also didn't pay attention to technology. Although his cotton grew taller than Pei Xingchen's, each cotton plant only had twelve bolls. It can't compare with Pei Xingchen." Peasant Pei Lide proposed to compare millet with Pei Xingchen. Their millet was both five feet tall, with ears of eight inches to one foot long, and each mu could produce one hundred and twenty catties. However, Pei Xingchen responded to the call of superiors and planted "Huanong No. 4" millet, which is of high quality. Pei Lide planted local millet, which is of low quality. As a result, Pei Xingchen still won. Finally, Pei Xingchen was elected as a model household. Various substitute farming groups also conducted mutual comparisons; many mutual aid teams also conducted comparisons with "individual households."
    This kind of vivid self-education has improved everyone's patriotic thinking. After comparing crops, many peasants expressed that they would learn from patriotic and high-yield models. They drew up production plans and strived to catch up with model households. However, some villages only compare the quality of crops in the comparison of crops and the election of models, and do not compare patriotic thought and action and the spirit of collective mutual assistance. This practice should be corrected.

    党的生活简评
    评选模范中可以进行生动的爱国主义教育
    河北、平原两省许多村庄的农民，在秋收前评比庄稼、选举模范时，相互进行了爱国主义的教育。如河北鸡泽县第一区农民提出，“爱祖国、响应上级号召、参加互助、庄稼长得好、在耕作技术上有创造”等，为评比中的优胜条件。大名县西马头村在评比庄稼时，农民裴立钦的棉花长得高，自己觉得可以当模范了；但是和农民裴星辰一比，裴立钦落了选。农民们的评议是：“人家裴星辰处处按着国家的计划办事，党和人民政府有了号召，他首先做在头里。春天他带头执行爱国公约，种了十亩棉花，又领导咱们完成了种棉计划。耕作上他注意技术，每棵棉有二十个大桃子，每亩能产六百斤到六百五十斤。裴立钦光怕种棉吃亏，只种了三亩；又不讲技术，他的棉花虽然比裴星辰的长得高，可是每棵棉只有十二个桃子。可比不上裴星辰。”农民裴立德提出和裴星辰比谷子。他俩的谷子都是五尺高，穗子有八寸到一尺长，每亩能产一百二十斤。可是裴星辰响应上级号召，种的是“华农四号”谷，谷子质量高，裴立德种的是本地谷，谷子质量低，结果仍是裴星辰胜了。最后裴星辰被选为模范户。各个代耕组之间也相互进行了评比；许多互助组又和“单干户”进行了评比。
    这种生动的自我教育，提高了大家的爱国思想。在评比庄稼之后，许多农民都表示要向爱国丰产模范学习，他们订出生产计划，争取赶上模范户。但也有一些村庄在评比庄稼选举模范中只比庄稼的好坏，不比爱国思想和行动以及集体互助精神，这种作法是应该纠正的。
