    The citizens' propaganda team of the No. 9 Police Station in the Second District of Beijing has created a method of holding a mass meeting every Sunday, based on the voluntary participation of the masses, with the "hutong" (street) as the unit, for propaganda purposes. They named this gathering "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country". Now, all fifteen sections of the police station are conducting "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" activities. Many people eat their meals early on Sundays and automatically go to the meetings with their small stools. Among them, the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" activity in Xiaoshaguo Hutong has been uninterrupted from May 27th to the present. The number of participants is about 80% of the total households in the hutong. The masses have developed a conscious habit of attending such meetings on time. Participating in the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" mass meeting has become a conscious public activity and an indispensable part of the local people's political life.
    The "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" activities are carried out under the leadership of the police station chief and the Resist America, Aid Korea branch. On this day, the mass meeting is convened by the citizens' propaganda team members of each hutong. Propaganda team members with higher skills explain current events, policies, and current central tasks at the meeting. Sometimes, local government propaganda staff, cadres, middle school teachers, university professors, and university and middle school students are invited to give reports. For example, the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" activity in Xiaoshaguo Hutong has carried out propaganda on issues such as the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Korean armistice negotiations, and opposition to the U.S. and Britain's separate peace treaty with Japan. It has also publicized central tasks such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, revising patriotic covenants, donating, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, establishing public security committees, sanitation, and fire prevention.
    The "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" activity of the No. 9 Police Station was established on the basis of the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, after the citizens had a certain degree of political consciousness. Active elements among the residents have done a lot of work to consolidate and develop the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" activities. For example, many women participate in the meetings, and children make noise during the meetings. They organize the children, give them picture books to read, tell them stories, or teach them to sing. Active elements take care of the babies in a centralized way. This allows the mothers to concentrate on listening to the lectures. Some people were initially unwilling to participate in the gatherings. They visited them individually, told them the benefits of learning, and understood and discussed specific solutions to some of the difficulties they had during the learning. Through "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country", patriotic propaganda and education work is carried out regularly and systematically to the residents, which greatly improves the political consciousness of the masses and smoothly promotes and completes various tasks. For example, Zhang, a 73-year-old woman in Xiaoshaguo Hutong, was furious after hearing about the brutal crimes of the American aggressor troops in Korea at the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" gathering. She said: "I am old, but if I were young, I would have taken up a gun and fought the American devils!" She sent her grandchildren to military cadre schools and wrote to encourage them, saying: "After you left, the neighbors often came to express their concern for me, and I am very happy. You must study hard and prepare to contribute to the country and the people!" At the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" gathering, models of executing patriotic covenants were commended, and typical experiences were introduced, which promoted the citizens' patriotic covenant movement and various public welfare undertakings. For example, the residents of the large courtyard at No. 15 Qiuzu Hutong formulated a patriotic covenant after participating in "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country." Originally, the courtyard was very dirty, and only Aunt Quan took care of the cleaning. Later, everyone got up early and scrambled to clean it. In order to save money for donations, the fifty-candlepower electric lights were changed to twenty-five-candlepower ones, saving half of the courtyard's electricity bill. Mutual love and unity increased, and everyone paid attention to preventing special agents, fire prevention, and theft prevention. A backward and dirty large courtyard has been transformed into a united and clean big family. Other tasks such as increasing production and donations, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, fire prevention, public security, and sanitation have all received the help and promotion of the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" propaganda.
    "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" has also strengthened the unity of the citizens. In the past, there was little contact between citizens, and neighbors often did their own things and did not care about each other. Through "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country", everyone got closer, got to know each other, and the feeling of mutual assistance and unity increased. For example, Ma Lin, a representative from Baoan Temple Street, had relatively difficult living conditions. When his wife gave birth to a child, the neighbors collected half a bag of flour and dozens of eggs to send to him.
    Because the Second District No. 9 Police Station's jurisdiction has the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" activities, the inspection, revision and execution of the patriotic covenant are also guaranteed to a certain extent. The "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country", which is warmly welcomed by the masses, has changed the face of several hutongs in the Second District No. 9 Police Station. This is a meaningful creation. However, in the process of work, leading cadres and active elements must pay close attention to cherishing the time of the masses. The meeting time should be short and should not hinder the work of the masses. At the same time, whether the masses attend the meeting or not should be completely voluntary, and there should be no coercion or compulsion. (Attached picture)

    北京市第二区第九派出所的“抗美援朝日”
    吕荫
    北京市第二区第九派出所的市民宣传队，创造了以胡同（街道）为单位，每逢星期日在群众自愿的基础上召开一次群众会进行宣传的方式。他们把这种集会定名为“抗美援朝日”。现在全派出所已有十五个地段分别进行“抗美援朝日”的活动，许多人每到星期天，就早早地吃了饭，拿着小板凳自动去开会。其中小沙果胡同的“抗美援朝日”，从五月二十七日到现在，一直没有间断过，参加的人数约为全胡同户数的百分之八十，群众已经养成了自觉地按时参加这种会议的习惯。参加“抗美援朝日”的群众会，已经成为当地群众自觉的公共活动和不可缺少的政治生活了。
    “抗美援朝日”的活动是在派出所所长和抗美援朝支会的领导之下进行的。在这一天，由各胡同的市民宣传队员主持召开群众会，由水平较高的宣传队员在会上讲解时事、政策及当前的中心工作，有时还聘请当地的机关宣传员、干部、中学教员、大学教授和大、中学生等去作报告。如小沙果胡同的“抗美援朝日”，曾进行有关西藏和平解放、朝鲜停战谈判、反对美英单独对日媾和等问题的宣传，又宣传过镇压反革命、修订爱国公约、捐献、拥军优属、成立治安保卫委员会、卫生、防火等中心工作。
    第九派出所的“抗美援朝日”是在普及和深入抗美援朝运动的基础上，市民有了一定的政治觉悟之后建立起来的。居民中的积极分子，为巩固和开展“抗美援朝日”的活动，曾作了不少工作。比如参加会的妇女很多，开会时小孩子吵闹，他们就把小孩组织起来，给他们看连环画、讲故事或教唱歌，婴儿则由积极分子集中照看。这样就使母亲们能集中精神听讲。有的群众起先不愿参加集会，他们就分别去拜访，告诉他们学习的好处，并且了解和商议具体解决他们学习中的若干困难。通过“抗美援朝日”，经常地有系统地向居民群众进行爱国主义的宣传教育工作，大大提高了群众的政治觉悟，顺利地推进、完成了各种工作。例如小沙果胡同七十三岁的张老太太，在“抗美援朝日”集会上听了美国侵略军在朝鲜的残暴罪行后，气愤地说：“我老了，要是年青的话，我早拿起枪杆和美国鬼子拚了！”她把孙儿、孙女都送去参加军事干部学校，并写信鼓励他们说：“你们走了以后，街坊常来慰问我，我很高兴。你们要努力学习，准备为国家、为人民出力！”在“抗美援朝日”的集会上，表扬了执行爱国公约的模范，介绍了典型经验，因而推动了市民的爱国公约运动，推动了各种公益事业。例如邱祖胡同十五号的大杂院的居民，参加了“抗美援朝日”之后，回去就订立了爱国公约。原来院里很脏，只权大妈一人打扫，以后大家都早起争着打扫了。为了节约捐献，把五十支烛光的电灯都改为二十五支烛光的，全院电灯费节省了一半。互相之间增加了友爱团结，大家都注意了防特、防火、防盗。把一个落后、脏污的大杂院，变成了团结而又清洁的大家庭了。其他如增产捐献、拥军优属、防火、治安、清洁卫生等工作，都获得了“抗美援朝日”宣传的帮助和推动。
    “抗美援朝日”也加强了市民的团结。过去市民之间很少联系，街坊邻居往往各干各的，互不关心。通过“抗美援朝日”，大家互相接近，彼此熟识了，互助团结的感情增涨了。如保安寺街代表马林生活比较困难，他的妻子生了孩子，邻居们就凑了半袋面和几十个鸡蛋送给他。
    二区第九派出所管段因为有了抗美援朝日的活动，对爱国公约的检查、修订和执行也有了一定的保证。为群众热烈欢迎的“抗美援朝日”，使二区第九派出所的若干胡同都改变了面貌，这是一个有意义的创造。只是在工作过程中，领导干部和积极分子要切实注意爱惜群众的时间。会议的时间要短，要不妨碍群众的业务，同时群众到会与否，应完全听其自愿，不要有任何的强迫勉强。（附图片）
