    The Story of Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun's Free Marriage
    Gao Shoujiang, Tian Mu
    In Xiangzhou Town, north of the Wei River in Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, although the idea of ​​freedom of marriage has been quite popular since liberation in 1946, there hasn't been a single truly free marriage. It wasn't until last year, when Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun fell in love freely, that they truly broke through the net of this feudal marriage system for the first time. They went through a tortuous struggle and finally triumphed. The following is the story of their struggle for freedom of marriage.
    I
    The Tai and Sun families of Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun live not far from each other, and they both come from poor backgrounds. Sun Tianjun herded cattle and sheep for landlords since he was a child; Tai Xiuying's father died when she was born, and her mother raised her by begging for food. They are both hardworking and often work together; over time, they developed a strong and sincere feeling. After liberation, both gradually grew up. Last year, Sun Tianjun was exactly nineteen, and Tai Xiuying was just seventeen; both were quite progressive in terms of work and thought. In the spring, they both joined the Communist Youth League. They often worked and studied together, helping each other and competing, and neither wanted to fall behind.
    They often worked in the fields during the day, and often attended meetings or studied together in the evenings. Tai Xiuying's home is on the edge of the village. Once, when they were going home together, Tai Xiuying said to Sun Tianjun, "I'm afraid to walk on a dark road alone." Sun Tianjun said, "If you're afraid, I'll walk you home." They both laughed as they spoke. In fact, both knew: Xiuying said she was afraid to deliberately find a reason for Sun Tianjun to walk her home, and Sun Tianjun also wanted to walk her home so they could talk on the road. Every time on the way home, the two talked about everything, from east to west, chatting so warmly that they gradually developed affection for each other. Both had thought: I've found such a perfect partner, it's really wonderful!
    Around July of last year, one day, the two went to the slope to cut grass together. While cutting the grass, they talked about how they suffered before liberation, how happy their lives are now, and also about the happy lives of the Soviet people. The more they talked, the more enthusiastic they became. Tai Xiuying suddenly thought of a long-held desire. She summoned up her courage and said to Sun Tianjun, "Now the government is calling for autonomous marriage, how about we take the lead?" These words made Sun Tianjun blush with both joy and shyness. Although they had talked about everything in the past, neither of them had been embarrassed to talk about this desire. Sun Tianjun was embarrassed by Tai Xiuying's sudden question and said, "Let's talk about it tomorrow." And so they parted ways.
    It just so happened that the village branch of the Communist Youth League held a meeting that night, calling on members of the Communist Youth League to actively participate in the autumn harvest and planting work; Youth League members also challenged each other at the meeting. Sun Tianjun went down to the slope early the next morning to work; Tai Xiuying also carried a basket to the field to pick mung beans. The two worked in the field and talked about it. Xiuying said, "Do you have any objections to our matter?" Tianjun said, "I completely agree, but what if my family doesn't agree?" Xiuying said, "Marriage autonomy is the government's regulation, our own affairs are none of the family's business!" Sun Tianjun said, "It's true that this is the government's regulation, but no one in our village has done it this way; if we do it this way for the first time, we will encounter many difficulties." Xiuying said, "We just need to have determination!" The two agreed to persuade their families together.
    II
    Both the Sun and Tai families of Sun Tianjun and Tai Xiuying are liberated households. Now each family farms four mu of land (720 steps per mu) and raises a small donkey, just enough to eat and wear each year. In terms of progress, neither family is worse than the other. Sun Tianjun's father, Sun Yuanqi, is the village's farmer representative, and he is happy to do whatever the government calls for. Tai Xiuying's elder brother, Tai Yongnian, is a Communist Party member and serves as the party branch secretary in the village; her mother, although older, does not prevent her son from working or her daughters and daughters-in-law from seeking progress, but she still has old ideas about her daughter's marriage. She feels that if her daughter is free to marry, there are two disadvantages: one is that she is afraid that her daughter is young and full of enthusiasm, only looking for a person, not wealth, and will suffer poverty in the future; and the other is that she is afraid that her daughter's "freedom" will make the neighbors laugh. Tai Xiuying went home and first explained some marriage laws to her mother, but her mother didn't seem to be in a good mood; after that, every time she explained, she didn't get a good look. One day, Tai Xiuying summoned up her courage and said to her mother, "Mother, you should worry less about my affairs in the future, my own husband should be found by myself." Her mother turned pale with anger when she heard this: "I see you've rebelled. If you dare to 'disgrace' me outside, I'll beat you to death, or make you be reborn elsewhere!" Tai Xiuying saw that things were not going well, so she didn't say anything more.
    At night, Tai Xiuying tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. At dawn, she went to find Wang Xiuzhen, the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League in the village. Wang Xiuzhen is Xiuying's sister-in-law. Tai Xiuying told her about her and Sun Tianjun. Wang Xiuzhen said, "You two are about the same conditions, and you will definitely be happy after you get married, I completely agree." She also agreed to mobilize her godmother—Xiuying's mother.
    Afterwards, Wang Xiuzhen found her godmother and brought up the matter of Xiuying and Tianjun. The godmother was furious when she heard this: "Your second sister-in-law, what does the Sun family have! An old one and a young one, they don't even have a 'family fortune,' I can't send my daughter into a fire pit." Xiuzhen said, "Mother, you still have an old-fashioned mind. We're looking for a person, not land." The mother thought for a while, and then changed her tune: "Mother has lived a lifetime, and I see things further than you. Even if the world has changed, a young woman can't find a man herself, wouldn't that be chaos? Are you trying to make me look bad?!" At that time, Wang Xiuzhen wasn't worried either, and still tried to persuade her slowly. However, Tai Xiuying, listening from the side, felt that if there was no result this time, there would be no chance in the future, so she might as well take advantage of her sister-in-law's presence, when there are more people and more reason to speak, so she butted in and said, "Whether you agree or not, I will definitely handle my own affairs myself!" The mother was so angry when she heard this that she pointed at Xiuying with her finger and said, "I raised you, and your wings have hardened and you want to fly, don't you? Then don't ever enter my door again!" Xiuying said, "I won't enter!" Xiuzhen saw that they were arguing, so she criticized Xiuying and told her not to be impatient, and to slowly mobilize. Then she called Tai Yongnian, Tai Xiuying's brother, over as well.
    Although Tai Yongnian is a Communist Party member and serves as the secretary of the village branch, and has always been active in his work, he also couldn't understand his sister's free love. He was mainly afraid of "losing" the face of the cadres, getting gossip in the village, and making it impossible to do work. So he said to his sister: "Xiuying, our mother and I raised you with blood and sweat since you were little, can't you even leave us a little face in this matter?" Xiuying said, "This is not a matter of face or not, the marriage law is the government's decree. You are a cadre, you should lead everyone to implement it." Tai Yongnian was speechless. Although he still stubbornly said "no," he didn't curse or scold, so he went to find someone to discuss the matter.
    III
    There is a Zhao Mingjiu in the village, over forty years old, who is a well-to-do middle peasant. In the old society, this person was eloquent, and everyone called him "Little Lawyer." Zhao Mingjiu had also long taken a fancy to Tai Xiuying's good looks, intelligence, and ability to work, and wanted to arrange for her to be his son's wife, but he never succeeded.
    On this day, Tai Yongnian found Zhao Mingjiu and asked him to think of a way about his sister's marriage. Zhao Mingjiu stroked his yellow beard and pretended to be serious: "If they make this happen, can you still stand in the village? You have to think of a way quickly, I'll help you." That same night, Tai Yongnian convened a meeting of all the Communist Youth League members in the village, wanting to mobilize all forty-plus Youth League members to struggle against Sun Tianjun and Tai Xiuying, giving them opinions, saying that Sun Tianjun was disrupting the group and forcing them to break off their relationship. But at the meeting, not a single Youth League member offered an opinion. Zhao Mingjiu thought of another way: to struggle against Wang Xiuzhen, the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League, who had introduced Sun Tianjun and Tai Xiuying. But everyone still didn't offer any opinions. Zhao Mingjiu personally went out and said to Wang Xiuzhen, "Why are you 'pimping'!" Wang Xiuzhen said, "Their love is legal! I only went to mobilize Tai Xiuying's mother after they agreed. Now there are people and evidence, they are both here." Without waiting to be asked, Sun Tianjun and Tai Xiuying said together: "We have not broken the law, and our love is also our own initiative." The plan to struggle against Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun failed. Tai Yongnian actually drew out the gun from his pocket, used the barrel of the gun to hit Sun Tianjun, and hung Sun Tianjun up, declaring that he would expel Sun Tianjun from the League. It wasn't until the village chief Wang Lianzhu (also the deputy secretary of the village branch) came out and sternly stopped them that Zhao and Tai released Sun Tianjun.
    In the midst of this, Tai Yongnian also forced Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun to break off their relationship, and threatened her: "If you don't break off, I'll beat you to death!" But Tai Xiuying was not afraid. Tai Yongnian had no choice, and later went home and sent people to watch Tai Xiuying and lock Tai Xiuying up.
    At this time, the higher authorities assigned the task of diverting the Shu River. Tai Yongnian volunteered to take the migrant workers to divert the Shu River. Zhao Mingjiu, in order to break up the marriage of Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun, said to Tai Yongnian, "You go to divert the Shu, it's best to take Sun Tianjun with you. Separating them will be fine."
    Not two days after Tai Yongnian and Sun Tianjun participated in the Shu diversion work, Zhao Mingjiu asked Zhao Peddler's wife to come to the Tai's house as a matchmaker. Tai Xiuying's mother disagreed. Zhao Mingjiu then asked Tai Xiuying's aunt to speak for him. Tai Xiuying's mother was being troubled by Xiuying's marriage freedom to the point that she had no way out, and was persuaded by the matchmakers' flowery words and agreed in a fit of anger.
    Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun's love was supported by the village chief, the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, and the vast majority of young men and women. When Tai Xiuying was locked up, the young people often secretly sent letters. When Xiuying's mother agreed to the Zhao family's marriage, Xiuying was living at her aunt's house. Now, the young people learned of this news and told Tai Xiuying, encouraging Tai Xiuying to fight on. Xiuying was so angry about this news that she didn't eat for two days. One night, young women Lü Mingli, Wang Xiulan, etc. secretly went to the base of Zhao Mingjiu's window and heard Zhao Mingjiu and others planning ways to soften Tai Xiuying. They came back and told Tai Xiuying, "You must never fall into their trap! It's a stupid way to just get angry and not eat. You might as well use both soft and hard tactics and wait for Sun Tianjun to come back." Xiuying agreed with their opinion.
    Zhao Mingjiu further courted Tai Xiuying, asking Tai Xiuying to live in his house for a few days. Zhao Mingjiu asked his wife to accompany Xiuying to play, and bought cloth for Xiuying to make clothes. One day, Zhao Mingjiu even led Xiuying, pointing to his granary and saying, "Look, coming to my house will really not make you suffer...." Xiuying said angrily, "I'm not envious of your few grains of rice!" Another night, it was pitch black. Zhao Mingjiu and his wife deliberately hid out, leaving their son Zhao Shugong at home. Tai Xiuying sat alone on the kang, staring straight at the oil lamp, thinking about things. Suddenly, Zhao Mingjiu's son Zhao Shugong slipped in. Xiuying jumped off the kang, pushed Zhao Shugong out, and bolted the door.
    IV
    On October 14th of last year, Zhao Mingjiu found Tai Xiuying's mother, aunt, and others, and forced Xiuying and his son to go to the district people's government to go through the marriage registration procedures. Xiuying thought, "Marriage autonomy is the government's decree; if I don't agree myself, the government will definitely not approve it, and will definitely take charge for me." So she went to the district people's government with Zhao Mingjiu's son and the matchmaker. When leaving, Zhao Mingjiu was overjoyed and said to Xiuying: "When you get to the district and someone asks you, you just say that this is completely free." Xiuying didn't say a word. When they arrived at the district people's government, the district head first asked the matchmaker: "Did you introduce them?" The matchmaker said: "They fell in love first, then I introduced them." He then asked Zhao Shugong: "Do you agree to marry Xiuying?" Zhao Shugong said: "I agree." He then asked Tai Xiuying: "Do you agree?" At this time, the matchmaker and Zhao Mingjiu's son were staring straight at Tai Xiuying, afraid that she would reveal the "secret." Tai Xiuying firmly replied: "I do not agree!" The matchmaker and others were stunned. The district head then explained the marriage law to them and criticized the matchmaker. The matchmaker, seeing that things were not going well, turned around and left. The district head said to Zhao Shugong and Tai Xiuying: "Your marriage is forced, and one party cannot register if they do not agree!" At this time, Tai Xiuying was indescribably happy.
    V
    In January of this year, the township convened a representative meeting. At the meeting, youth and women representatives put forward a proposal, unanimously requesting the government to handle the marriage problem of Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun, and requesting the government to sanction Zhao Mingjiu, Tai Yongnian, and other criminal acts of violating human rights and interfering with freedom of marriage. However, some district cadres had a wrong idea. They were afraid that handling this problem would involve the three main cadres of this village, and it would be difficult to promote work in the future. They adopted a delaying attitude towards this problem and did not ask about it.
    Later, the matter spread to Shangcao Village, five miles away from Xiangzhou Town. The masses of Shangcao Village also unanimously requested the government to handle this problem. Zhao Jixing, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Shangcao Village, seeing that this matter was unreasonable, wrote an article and submitted it to the Jinan Rural Mass Newspaper; the newspaper then wrote several letters to the district, suggesting that the district people's government handle it quickly. Later, the county people's court legally sentenced Zhao Mingjiu, who violated human rights, to three years in prison; Tai Yongnian to one year in prison. A mass meeting was also held in the village to announce the results of the handling; Zhao Mingjiu and Tai Yongnian reviewed their mistakes to everyone. Everyone applauded and praised: "The current government is really the people's government; no matter who breaks the law, they must be handled impartially."
    When Sun Tianjun and Tai Xiuying went to the district people's government to go through the marriage registration procedures, the courtyard of the district government was crowded with people, and everyone was scrambling to see this new couple who truly freely fell in love and married. The young people jumped, bounced, and clapped their hands, composing the following two ballads for them:
    "Mabu Street (the name of the street they live on) is long from east to west, at the west end there is a girl named Tai, she found herself a desirable husband."
    "Sun Tianjun and Tai Xiuying, fell in love and succeeded; they can work and produce, and build a good family."
    On July 14th of this year, Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun got married. Forty-eight relatives and friends in the village came to give gifts, and representatives from more than a dozen surrounding villages also came to congratulate them. The Shandong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the Rural Mass Newspaper, the Zhucheng County Democratic Women's Federation, and the Zhucheng County Committee of the Communist Youth League also sent congratulatory accounts. A Sister Wang in her thirties said: "The society led by Chairman Mao is really good! Look at those two people, it's really enviable, it's a pity I was born a few years too early."

    邰秀英孙田均自由结婚的故事
    高寿江、田  牧
    在山东省诸城县北部的潍河西岸，有个相州镇。这里从一九四六年解放以后，虽然婚姻自由的风声挺盛，可是真正自由结婚的还没有一对。直到去年，邰秀英、孙田均两人自由恋爱，才真正第一次冲破了这封建婚姻制度的罗网。他俩经过了曲折的斗争，最后胜利了。下面就是他们为争取婚姻自由而斗争的故事。
    一
    邰秀英和孙田均两家相距不远，他俩都是穷人出身。孙田均从小给地主家放牛羊；邰秀英自生下来，父亲就死了，是母亲要饭把她养大的。他俩都好劳动，又常在一起劳动；日久天长，就建立起一种浓厚而真挚的感情。解放以后，两个渐渐长大了，去年，孙田均整整十九，邰秀英刚刚十七；两个人在工作、思想方面都挺进步。春天的时候，一齐参加了青年团。工作、学习也常在一块，互相帮助、比赛，谁也不肯落后。
    他两人常常白天在坡里生产，晚上也常常在一起开会或学习。邰秀英的家住在村边。一次两人回家的时候，邰秀英向孙田均说：“一个人走黑路，怪害怕的。”孙田均说：“你害怕，我去送你。”说着两个人都笑了。其实两个人心里都有数：秀英说害怕是故意找个理由要孙田均送送，孙田均也正想送送她，路上好说说话。每次回家的路上，两个人论长道短，从东到西，扯得那么热呼，就渐渐地你有情、我有意了。两个人都曾这样想：我找到这么个对象，真太美满啦！
    去年七月间，有一天，两个人一齐去坡里割草。他们一面割着草，一面扯起翻身前怎样受苦，现在的日子怎样幸福，又谈起苏联人民的幸福生活，越说越热。邰秀英突然想起已久的心事，她鼓了鼓勇气向孙田均说：“现在政府号召婚姻自主，咱俩先带个头怎样？”一句话，说得孙田均又喜又羞地红了脸，过去两个人虽然什么话都说，可是这个心事，两个人却都没有好意思谈过。孙田均被邰秀英这样突然一问，怪不好意思地说：“咱明天再谈谈吧。”就这样分了手。
    恰巧这天晚上，正赶上青年团村支部召开会议，号召青年团员积极参加秋收秋种工作；青年团员们并在会上互相挑了战。孙田均第二天一早就下坡去干活；邰秀英也提着篮子到地里摘绿豆去了。两个人，在地里一面干活，一面谈起来。秀英说：“咱那事你有意见不？”田均说：“我完全同意，可是，家里人不同意怎么办？”秀英说：“婚姻自主，这是政府的规定，我们自己的事，家里管不着！”孙田均说：“这是政府的规定不错，可是咱村里还没有一个这样办的；咱俩第一次这样办，会碰到很多困难的。”秀英说：“咱只要有决心就行！”两个人约定一齐回去说服自己的家人。
    二
    孙田均和邰秀英两家都是翻身户。现在每家种着四亩地（七百二十步的亩）都喂着一头小毛驴，是年吃年穿的光景。论进步，两家都不次。孙田均的父亲孙元奇是本村的农民代表，只要是政府号召的工作，他就高兴办。邰秀英的大哥邰永年是共产党员，在村里担任党的支部书记；她母亲，虽然年纪大些，但对儿子干工作，女儿，儿媳妇求进步也不阻拦，就是对女儿的婚事还有旧的想法。她觉得女儿婚姻自由了有两大不好处：一是怕女儿年轻，一股热劲，光找人、不找财，以后会要吃苦受穷；二是怕女儿“自由”了叫街坊邻居笑话。邰秀英回家先向母亲讲解了一些婚姻法，看样子母亲的气不大顺；以后每次讲每次都没个好脸看。有一天，邰秀英鼓了鼓勇气向母亲说：“娘，我的事，以后你少操心吧，自己的丈夫应该由我自己找。”娘一听就气黄了脸：“我看你反了，如果你敢在外面给我‘丢人’，打不死你，也叫你另脱生！”邰秀英一见事不妙，也就没有啃气。
    晚上，邰秀英翻来覆去地睡不着。天一亮，她就去找本村的青年团副书记王秀珍。王秀珍是秀英的干嫂子。邰秀英把自己和孙田均的事说了一遍。王秀珍说：“你们俩，条件差不多，结婚以后，一定很美满，我完全赞成。”她并答应去动员干娘——秀英的母亲。
    以后，王秀珍找到干娘，提起了秀英和田均的事。干娘一听就火啦：“你二嫂，孙家有什么呀！老一个小一个的，连个‘家底子’也没有，俺可不能把姑娘往火坑里送。”秀珍说：“娘，你还是老脑筋哩。咱是找人又不是找地。”娘想了一想，又转了弯说：“娘活了一辈子，看事总比你们远。就说世道变了吧，也不能大姑娘自己找汉子，那不乱了吗？你叫俺难看不是？！”当时，王秀珍也没有着急，还是慢慢地劝说。可是，邰秀英在旁边一听，觉得如果这次没有结果，以后就没有影子了，不如趁干嫂子在，人多理壮的时候讲一讲，就顶着说：“不管你通不通，我自己的事一定自己办！”娘一听，气得用手指着秀英说：“把你养大，翅膀硬了想飞不是？那从今你就一辈子别进我的门！”秀英说：“不进就不进！”秀珍一看吵起来了，就批评了秀英一顿，嘱咐她不要心急，应该慢慢地动员。接着把邰秀英的哥哥邰永年也叫了来。
    邰永年虽然是个共产党员，担任村支部的书记，工作一贯积极，但对妹妹自由恋爱，思想也打不通。他主要是怕“丢了”干部的脸，在村里落些闲话，工作没法干了。就向妹妹说：“秀英，咱娘和我是从小用血汗把你养大的，这件事你连一点面子也不留吗？”秀英说：“这不是什么面子不面子，婚姻法是政府的法令。你是个干部，应该领导大伙实行。”说得邰永年理屈无言。他虽然还是一口咬着“不行”，但也没有咒念，就去找人商量这件事去了。
    三
    村子里有个赵明九，四十多岁年纪，是个富裕中农。在旧社会里，这人能说会道，大家都称他“小讼师”。赵明九也早看中了邰秀英长的好，又伶俐，能生产，想把她说给儿子当媳妇，但总没得手。
    这天，邰永年找到赵明九，叫对自己妹妹的婚事想办法。赵明九将黄胡子一捋，假装正经说：“这事叫他们闹成了，你还在村里站得住？得赶快想法，我帮助你。”就在当天晚上，邰永年召集了全村青年团团员大会，想发动全村四十多个青年团员，斗争孙田均和邰秀英，给他俩提意见，说孙田均破坏团体，强迫他们断绝关系。但是在会上，青年团员们没有一个提意见的。赵明九又想了一个办法：要斗争给孙田均、邰秀英当介绍人的青年团副书记王秀珍。可是大家还是不提意见。赵明九就亲自出马向王秀珍说：“你为什么‘扯皮条’！”王秀珍说：“他们恋爱是合法的！他俩同意以后，我才去动员邰秀英的娘。现在事有人，物有证，他们两人都在。”没等问，孙田均、邰秀英一齐说：“我们没有犯法，恋爱也是我们自己主动的。”斗争邰秀英和孙田均的计划失败了。邰永年竟抽出怀里的枪，用枪筒子打孙田均，并将孙田均吊起来，声言要开除孙田均的团籍。直到村长王连珠（兼村支部副书记）出来严厉制止，赵、邰二人才将孙田均放开。
    在这当中，邰永年还曾逼着邰秀英和孙田均断绝关系，并威吓她：“你不断，也打死你！”但邰秀英并不害怕。邰永年没法，后来就回家派人看着邰秀英，将邰秀英关起来了。
    这时，上级布置了导沭河的任务。邰永年自告奋勇带着民工去导沭去了。赵明九为了拆散邰秀英和孙田均的婚姻，又和邰永年说：“你去导沭，最好把孙田均带去。把他们隔开就没事了。”
    邰永年和孙田均参加导沭工作没两天，赵明九就托赵货郎的老婆来邰家说媒。邰秀英的母亲不同意。赵明九又托邰秀英的姨来说。秀英的母亲，正被秀英闹婚姻自由闹得没有法子，被这些媒人花言巧语地一气说的竟答应了。
    邰秀英和孙田均恋爱，是受到村长、团支部副书记和广大青年男女的支持的。邰秀英被关的时候，青年们常常暗地里去送信，秀英母亲答应赵家婚事的时候，秀英正住在姨家。现在，青年们又探听了这个消息，告诉给邰秀英，鼓励邰秀英斗争下去。秀英为这个消息气得两天没吃饭。有天晚上，青年妇女律明礼、王秀兰等又悄悄地到赵明九的窗根下，听见了赵明九等正在计划软化邰秀英的办法，她们回来就告诉邰秀英说：“你可千万不要上了他们的圈套呀！你光生气不吃饭，这是个傻办法。你不如软硬都使，等孙田均回来再说。”秀英同意了她们的意见。
    赵明九又进一步拉拢邰秀英，叫邰秀英到他家去住几天。赵明九叫他老婆陪着秀英玩，给秀英买布作衣裳。有一天，赵明九还领着秀英指着他的粮仓说：“你看，来我家实在是难为不着你……。”秀英生气说：“俺不眼热你这几个粮食粒子！”另一天晚上，天漆黑，赵明九和老婆故意躲出去，把儿子赵树功留在家里。邰秀英自己坐在炕上，两眼直直地正看着油灯想心事。忽然赵明九的儿子赵树功溜了进来，秀英跳下炕去，将赵树功一把推出去，闩上了门。
    四
    去年十月十四日，赵明九找了邰秀英的娘、姨等人，强迫秀英和他儿子去区人民政府办理结婚登记手续。秀英想：“婚姻自主，是政府的法令；我自己不同意，政府一定不批准，一定给我作主。”就和赵明九的儿子，还有媒人去了区人民政府。临走的时候，赵明九喜极了，向秀英说：“到区有人问你，你就说这是完全自由的。”秀英一声也没啃。到了区人民政府，区长先问媒人：“他们俩是你介绍的吗？”媒人说：“他们是先恋爱，后介绍的。”又问赵树功：“你和秀英结婚同意吗？”赵树功说：“同意。”又问邰秀英：“你同意吗？”这时，媒人和赵明九的儿子，直望着邰秀英，怕她露了“馅子”。邰秀英坚决地回答：“我不同意！”媒人等人都发呆了。区长便向他们讲了一遍婚姻法，并把媒人批评了一顿。媒人一见事不妙，回头就走了。区长向赵树功和邰秀英说：“你们的婚姻是强迫的，有一方不同意不能登记！”这时，邰秀英有说不出的高兴。
    五
    今年一月，乡里召开了一个代表会，会上，青年、妇女代表提出了一个提案，一致要求政府处理关于邰秀英和孙田均的婚姻问题，并要求政府制裁赵明九、邰永年等侵犯人权，干涉婚姻自由的犯罪行为。但区干部有一种错误的思想，他们怕处理这个问题，会牵连到这村的三个主要干部，以后工作就不好推动了。对这个问题，他们采取了拖延不问的态度。
    以后这事传到了距相州镇五里的上曹村，上曹村的群众也一致要求政府处理这个问题。上曹村青年团支部书记赵吉星，见这事不合理，写了一篇稿子投到济南农村大众报社；报社便接连向该区写了几封信，建议区人民政府迅速处理。以后，县人民法院依法判处了侵犯人权的赵明九三年徒刑；邰永年一年徒刑。又在村里召开了群众大会，宣布了处理结果；赵明九、邰永年向大家检讨了自己的错误。大家拍手称赞说：“现在的政府真是人民的政府了；勿论谁犯了法，也得公事公办。”
    孙田均和邰秀英到区人民政府办理结婚登记手续的时候，区政府的院子里挤满了人，大家都争看这一对真正自由恋爱结婚的新夫妇。青年们跳着、蹦着、拍着手给他们编了下面两支歌谣：
    “麻布街（是他们住的这条街的名字），东西长，西头有个邰姑娘，自己找了个可心郎。”
    “孙田均和邰秀英，恋爱成了功；劳动能生产，建设好家庭。”
    今年七月十四日，邰秀英和孙田均结婚了。村中四十八家亲友来送礼，周围十几个村庄也都有代表来贺喜。山东省民主妇女联合会、农村大众报社、诸城县民主妇女联合会和青年团诸城县委会还送来了贺帐。一个三十多岁的王大嫂说：“毛主席领导的社会真好！看看人家俩人真叫人眼热，可惜咱早生了几年。”（原载山东大众日报）
