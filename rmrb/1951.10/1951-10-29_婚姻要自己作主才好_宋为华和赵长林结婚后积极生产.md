    It's Good to Make Your Own Decisions About Marriage
    -- Song Weihua and Zhao Changlin Actively Produce After Marriage
    Song Weihua, a woman from Xiaodian Natural Village, Paifang Administrative Village, Eleventh District, Beijing suburbs, was married through an arranged marriage by her parents and became a widow at the age of twenty. "A good horse doesn't carry two saddles, a virtuous woman doesn't marry twice," were the teachings of her parents and neighbors. However, Song Weihua also often heard village cadres say: "Marriage is now free. Others cannot interfere with a widow remarrying." Song Weihua felt conflicted and struggled internally.
    There was a man in the same village named Zhao Changlin, twenty-three years old, healthy, with a good job, and a member of the Communist Youth League. Song Weihua thought Zhao Changlin was quite good. Soon, Zhao Changlin met Song Weihua and learned that Song Weihua was also a production expert. Whenever they met, they felt a burning sensation in their hearts; they wanted to talk, but their faces turned red and they passed each other by. Finally, one day, they talked in the garden, and Zhao Changlin mustered his courage and spoke first: "Can we two..." Song Weihua interrupted him before he could finish, saying, "We both know each other, but I'm afraid our parents won't agree." The two of them spoke their minds freely.
    Not long after, Zhao Changlin and Song Weihua became even more certain: they wanted to break through the feudal marriage system and have independent marriages. Encouraged by Zhao Changlin, Song Weihua was determined to fight her feudal family to the end. They happily went to the district government to get their marriage certificate. However, Song Weihua's parents did not agree.
    Song Weihua persisted in the struggle for more than two weeks and finally convinced her parents. She married Zhao Changlin on September 28th.
    After getting married, the couple got up early and went to bed late every day, working hard in production. Now they plan to go to winter school together to learn culture. The villagers said, "No one in our village is as affectionate as that young couple." An old lady said, "We are old, it is better for young people to make their own decisions."

    婚姻要自己作主才好
    ——宋为华和赵长林结婚后积极生产
    北京郊区十一区牌坊行政村小店自然村妇女宋为华，由父母包办婚姻结婚，今年二十岁就守了寡。“好马不背双鞍，烈女不嫁二郎”，这是父母、乡邻们的教训。可是，宋为华又常听村干部们说：“婚姻自由了。寡妇嫁人，旁人不能干涉。”宋为华心里矛盾着、斗争着。
    同村有个赵长林，二十三岁，身体好，工作好，又是青年团员。宋为华觉得赵长林可不错。不久，赵长林认识了宋为华，知道宋为华也是生产能手。他俩一遇到，总是心里火辣辣的；想说话，脸一红又过去了。终于有一天，他俩在园子里谈了话，赵长林鼓足勇气先开口：“咱俩人是不是能……。”宋为华没等他说完就接着说：“咱俩谁都知道谁，就怕父母不答应。”俩人畅快地谈了心里的话。
    过了不久，赵长林和宋为华更肯定了：要冲破封建婚姻制度，要自主结婚。宋为华在赵长林鼓励下，决心向封建家庭斗争到底。他俩高高兴兴地去区政府领了结婚证。但是，宋为华的父母都不同意。
    宋为华坚持了两星期多的斗争，终于打通了父母的思想，在九月二十八日和赵长林结了婚。
    结婚后，俩口整天起早睡晚，劳动生产，现在他们计划一起去上冬学学文化。老乡们说：“咱村谁也没有人家小俩口那样亲热”。有一位老太太说：“咱们岁数大了，还是小伙子们自己作主的好。”
