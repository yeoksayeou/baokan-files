    The Central-South Region procured over 190,000 dan of new cotton in September, exceeding the original procurement plan by 55.37%. The Central-South Region had a bumper cotton harvest this year. According to a preliminary investigation by the China National Cotton Yarn & Fabrics Corporation's Central-South Region branch, the total cotton production this year is estimated to be double that of last year. Since new cotton began to be marketed in large quantities in September, the state-owned cotton yarn and fabrics companies in the Central-South Region have been focusing on expanding their organizations and going deep into cotton-producing areas for procurement. At the same time, they signed a long-term agreement with the Central-South Region Cooperative Affairs Administration to entrust cooperatives in cotton-producing areas such as Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi to purchase new cotton on their behalf. In order to support the cooperatives, state-owned cotton yarn and fabrics companies in various places have dispatched cotton grading personnel to assist the cooperatives in handling cotton inspection work. Before the new cotton was marketed in Yuxian County, Henan Province, state-owned cotton yarn and fabrics companies also helped the cooperatives to open training classes for cotton grading personnel. In addition, state-owned cotton yarn and fabrics companies in various places pre-allocated cotton purchasing funds to the cooperatives, averaging the amount required for three days of procurement. Simultaneously with procurement, state-owned cotton yarn and fabrics companies in various places are stepping up ginning and transportation work. In cotton-producing areas such as Tianmen and Gong'an in Hubei Province, and Lushi County in Henan Province, state-owned cotton yarn and fabrics companies organized private ginning households into joint operations at the end of August, entrusting them to purchase and gin new cotton on their behalf. Since late September, the Central-South Region and Hubei Province's cotton yarn and fabrics companies have uniformly prepared tugboats, wooden boats, automobiles, and other transportation tools, and made special trips to major cotton distribution centers in Hubei such as Yichang, Tianmen, Fancheng, and Echeng to rush-transport new cotton. Because the ginning and transportation were swift, the supply of raw cotton to textile factories in the East China Region and within the Central-South Region was guaranteed.

    Shaanxi Province exceeded its new cotton procurement and allocation plan for September. As of September 30, the province had procured a total of 90,396 dan of new cotton, exceeding the original target by more than 4%. It allocated 30,500 dan of new cotton, exceeding the original target by more than 1%.

    Cotton farmers and mutual aid teams in the cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province actively responded to the patriotic cotton selling challenge put forward by the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team. After the news of Qu Yaoli's patriotic cotton selling challenge was released, more than 20 mutual aid teams in Anyi, Wenxi, Hongdong, and other counties successively discussed the challenge conditions put forward by the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team, studied the actual situation of their own teams, and proposed to accept the challenge. The challenge letters from seven mutual aid teams in Libao Village, Hongdong County, stated: "Our seven mutual aid teams have planted a total of 224 mu of cotton, and each mu can produce 253 jin of seed cotton, an increase of 133 jin compared to last year. We all know that without the leadership of the People's Government and the support of the working-class elder brothers, we would not have such a good harvest. We guarantee that all of this year's new cotton harvest, except for a small amount for our own use, will be sold to the state." The Su Yuyin Mutual Aid Team in Tonghua Village, Hejin County, decided that all 13 mu of cotton in the team, except for 20 jin of ginned cotton for their own use, would be sold to the state. Li Zhenrong, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Nanchuankou Village, Wenxi County, Zhou Quande, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Xiyan Village, Pinglu County, Zhang Chengxin, the village chief of Huainanbai Village, Yuanqu County, and others also responded to the challenge from the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team. They guaranteed that in addition to taking the lead in selling cotton themselves, they would also mobilize other cotton farmers to sell all their cotton to the state.

    中南区和陕西省
    九月份超额完成收购新棉任务
    山西产棉区棉农响应曲耀离互助组爱国售棉挑战
    中南区九月份收购新棉十九万多担，超过原订收购计划百分之五十五点三七，中南区今年棉花丰收，据中国花纱布公司中南区公司的初步调查，今年棉花的总产量约比去年增加一倍。自九月份新棉大量上市以来，中南区国营花纱布公司一方面有重点的扩大机构，深入产棉区收购；同时和中南区合作事业管理局签订了长期协议，委托河南、湖北、湖南、江西等产棉区合作社代购新棉。为了扶植合作社，各地国营花纱布公司大部都派出了棉花分级人员协助合作社办理棉花检验工作。河南禹县等地新棉上市前，国营花纱布公司并帮助合作社开办了棉花分级人员训练班。此外，各地花纱布公司都预拨给合作社平均三天收购量的购棉资金。和收购同时，各地国营花纱布公司正加紧轧花和运输工作。湖北省天门、公安，河南省卢氏等县产棉地区国营花纱布公司都在八月底组织私营轧花户联营，委托他们代购、代轧新棉。自九月下旬起，中南区和湖北省花纱布公司统一准备了拖轮、木船、汽车等运输工具，专程到湖北的宜昌、天门、樊城、鄂城等主要棉花集散地抢运新棉。因为轧、运迅速，保证了华东区和中南区内各纺织工厂的原棉供应。（新华社）
    陕西省九月份已超额完成新棉的收购与调拨计划。截至九月三十日止，该省共收购新棉九万零三百九十六担，超过原任务的百分之四强。调拨新棉三万零五百担，超过原任务的百分之一强。

    山西省产棉区棉农和互助组积极响应曲耀离互助组提出的爱国售棉挑战。曲耀离的爱国售棉挑战消息发出后，安邑、闻喜、洪洞等县二十余个互助组先后讨论了曲耀离互助组提出的挑战条件，研究了本组的实际情况，提出应战。洪洞县李堡村的七个互助组应战书上写着：“我们七个互助组共种棉二百二十四亩，每亩可产籽棉二百五十三斤，比去年增加一百三十三斤。我们都知道，没有人民政府的领导和工人老大哥的支援，是不会有这样好收成的。我们保证把今年收获的新棉除少数自用外，全部卖给国家。”河津县通化村苏玉印互助组确定全组十三亩棉花除留二十斤皮棉自用外，其余全部卖给国家。闻喜县南川口村中共支部书记李珍荣、平陆县西延村中共支部书记周全德、垣曲县槐南白村村长张承信等也都向曲耀离互助组应战，他们保证除了自己带头售棉外，并发动其他棉农把棉花全部卖给国家。（新华社）
