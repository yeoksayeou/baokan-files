    Beijing Garment Factory Should Not Overly Restrict Age When Recruiting Workers
    To the Editor:
    The Beijing Garment Factory, in its four consecutive recruitment drives for sewing workers, mechanically restricted the age (under thirty-five years old) without considering the actual technical skills required. This is inappropriate. The Beijing Unemployed Workers Relief Committee introduced several unemployed sewing workers to participate in the factory's examination. Among them, one unemployed worker was thirty-seven years old, had worked as a sewing worker in the garment factory for many years, possessed excellent skills, and was physically very strong, but was not allowed to take the exam because her age exceeded the limit by two years. I believe this practice of the Beijing Garment Factory is wrong and should be corrected. Because on the one hand, it affects the employment of skilled workers, and on the other hand, it makes it difficult for the factory to find workers. Liu Yunkai

    北京被服厂招收工人不应过苛限制年龄编辑同志：
    北京被服厂连续四次招考缝纫工的时候，不从实际的技术条件出发，机械地限制年龄（三十五岁以下），这是不妥当的。北京失业工人救济委员会曾介绍失业缝纫工数名，参加该厂考试。其中有一名失业工人三十七岁，曾在被服厂当缝纫工多年，技术优良，身体很健壮，但因其年龄超过两岁，未准考试。我认为北京被服厂这种作法是不对的，应该改正。因为这样一方面影响了有技术的工人就业，一方面使工厂找不到工人。  刘云凯
