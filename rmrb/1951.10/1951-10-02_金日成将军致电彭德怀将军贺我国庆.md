Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st - General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, sent a congratulatory telegram to General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on October 1st. The telegram reads as follows:

To General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

On the occasion of the glorious National Day of the Chinese people - the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I extend my warm congratulations to you and all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on behalf of all the Korean people, all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, and myself.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people founded the People's Republic of China and have achieved great victories in various tasks of building a new China in the past two years.

This victory of the Chinese people has made a great contribution to the further consolidation of the powerful international democratic camp and the peace and security of the Far East.

The Korean people and the Korean People's Army, who have risen up to fight a just struggle against the armed aggression of the United States and Britain for the independence, freedom, and honor of their motherland, are encouraged by the friendly assistance of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and are more determined in their confidence in victory.

I wish you and all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army even greater victories in the sacred struggle to eliminate the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples - the American aggressors.

Korean People's Army Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung
October 1, 1951, Pyongyang
