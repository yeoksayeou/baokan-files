	The North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition opened in Tianjin on October 5th. Liu Lantao, Minister of the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony. (Contribution from the Tianjin Daily Art Group)
	In order to implement the principle of "the exhibition is the market," the conference decided to handle material exchange business during the conference. More than a thousand trade delegations from all over the country have arrived in Tianjin.
	This is the scene when the Tianjin Municipal Committee sent people to the station to hold a welcome meeting when the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce delegation arrived in Tianjin. A sculpture of the worker-peasant alliance stands in the center of the venue.
	New agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, and agricultural machinery and equipment are displayed in the agricultural production materials hall, pointing out the broad prospects for agricultural mechanization to farmers. This is the Shuangshou ten-row seeder manufactured by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, which can sow 40 to 60 mu per day.
	Representatives from all walks of life enter the venue. (Contribution from the Tianjin Daily Art Group)
	The agricultural production materials hall exhibited many physical objects and specimens, introducing in detail the significant role and usage methods of various new agricultural tools in agricultural production. This is a self-propelled harvester displayed in the hall.
	The exhibits in the medicine hall specifically pointed out the direction of future scientific modernization of Chinese medicine: combining Chinese and Western medicine, and engaging in research and improvement. In the past, we relied entirely on foreign imports of red mercury, penicillin, etc., but now we can make them ourselves, and most of them can be self-sufficient. This is an exhibit of penicillin (penicillin) made by the Beijing Tiantan Pharmaceutical Factory.
	When farmer representatives from various places arrived in Tianjin to visit, the conference specially sent staff to welcome them at the station. (Contribution from the Tianjin Daily Art Group)
	The quality and output of China's bristles are the first in the world, and they are very useful in industrial and national defense construction. These are exhibits of bristles, a specialty of North China, that have been processed and displayed in the animal husbandry hall.
	The mineral section of the heavy industry hall focuses on coal and iron exhibitions, introducing North China's rich coal and iron reserves, as well as advanced experience and technology in mining. This is a domestically produced coal cutting machine, a new type of machine for modern coal mining.
	The economic crop hall introduced a method of using rhizobium to mix with peanut seeds. It can absorb 80% of the nitrogen in the air, which is equivalent to fertilizing the crops. Every mu of rhizobium can increase peanut production by 30% to more than double.
	More than 10,000 workers and farmer representatives from Tianjin and North China held a joint celebration meeting on October 7. Worker and peasant brothers, who had been isolated by the reactionary rule for a long time before liberation, met today. Workers and peasants shouted slogans such as "Consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and build a great motherland" at the meeting. This is Chairman Huang Huoqing of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions speaking at the meeting. (Contribution from the Tianjin Daily Art Group)

    扩大城乡物资交流，发展工农业生产——华北区城乡物资交流展览会开幕
        华北区城乡物资交流展览会会场全景
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会于十月五日在天津市开幕，中央人民政府华北事务部部长刘澜涛在大会开幕典礼上剪彩。    （天津日报美术组稿）
    大会为贯彻“会场就是市场”的方针，决定在大会期间办理物资交流业务，全国各地贸易代表团共千余人均已抵天津。
    这是山西省工商业联合会代表团抵天津时，大会派人在车站举行欢迎会的情形。耸立在会场中心的工农联盟雕塑。
    在农业生产资料馆内陈列着新式农具、化学肥料及农用药械等，给农民指出了农业机械化远大的前途。这是华北农业机械总厂制造的双兽十行播种机，每日可播种四十亩到六十亩。
    各界代表进入会场。

    在农业生产资料馆中展出了许多实物和标本，详细地介绍了各种新式农具对农业生产上的重大作用及使用方法。这是陈列在馆内的自拨式收割机。
    药物馆中的展览品，具体地指明了今后国药科学化的方向：结合中西医药，从事研究改进。过去一贯仰赖外国进口的红汞、盘尼西林等，现已能自制，大部分已能自给。这是北京天坛制药厂自制的盘尼西林（青霉素）的展览品。
     各地农民参观代表抵天津时，大会特派工作人员在车站欢迎。

    我国猪鬃的品质和产量均为世界第一，在工业和国防建设上的用途很大。这是在畜产馆陈列的华北特产经过加工的猪鬃展品。
    重工业馆矿产部分以煤铁展览为中心，介绍了华北丰富的煤铁蕴藏量，以及开采中的先进经验和技术。这是国产截煤机，是近代开采煤矿的新式机器。
    经济农作物馆内介绍了一种花生使用根瘤菌拌种方法，它可以吸收空气中百分之八十的氮气，就等于替庄稼上肥一样，每亩以二斤根瘤菌，可以使花生产量增加三成到一倍多。
    天津市工人与华北区农民代表万余人，于十月七日举行联欢大会。解放前长期被反动统治隔离的工农兄弟今天见面了，工人和农民在会上欢呼“巩固工农联盟，建设伟大祖国”等口号。这是天津市总工会黄火青主席在大会上讲话。
