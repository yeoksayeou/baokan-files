    The Yuehan Railway Wuhan Branch and its subordinate sections and offices are seriously plagued by the accumulation of large amounts of funds. For example, the value of materials stored in the Branch's telecommunications section exceeds 1.1 billion, while only about 100 million worth of materials is needed for turnover. The first inventory of materials stored in the locomotive section showed a value exceeding 2.4 billion, while only about 200 million was actually needed. Funds were accumulated more than tenfold. Some materials are not needed or urgently needed by the unit at all. For example, the telecommunications section has more than 12,500 kilograms of galvanized iron wire, worth more than 150 million; and 660 kilograms of hard copper wire, worth more than 25 million. Because there are no construction tasks, they have been sitting in the warehouse.
    While clearing the inventory, the railway workers of the branch, under the slogans of "Road Materials Go Home" and "Waste Materials Get a New Lease on Life," collected a large amount of valuable property for the country. For example, the engineering section of the branch collected more than 1,900 steel rails, which can be used to repair more than ten kilometers of railway; the ferry department collected sixteen tons of old steel plates; the Changsha Bridge coal plant collected materials (bridge steel plates, etc.) worth more than 2 billion; the locomotive section cleared out fifty to sixty tons of "waste materials"; and the inspection car section cleared out eighty-eight tons of "waste materials," worth more than 120 million. Some workers said: "Things that haven't been touched for decades have now been given a new lease on life!" Some of these "waste materials" can be used (for example, the telecommunications section found more than 100 kilograms of iron wire in the "waste materials," worth more than 3 million), some need to be processed before they can be used, and some need to be re-smelted.
    The cleanup has made cadres and the masses understand the importance of cherishing and rationally using funds. For example, the head of the locomotive section said: In the past, not only did the masses not know how much we had, but even we were confused. Now we have a better idea, and there is a basis for economic accounting! Some workers in the locomotive section said: "If the state could use the funds we have accumulated, wouldn't we be able to add ten more locomotive sections?" After the workers' understanding was improved, they paid great attention to the property of the state. For example, some workers in the telecommunications section said: "In the past, we wouldn't work without materials, but now we have to calculate and use old materials." Some workers in the inspection car section dug up things buried underground and said: "This is all state property!" In addition, the workers also consciously donated a lot of equipment.

    粤汉铁路武昌分局积压资金的情况
    张敬先
    粤汉铁路武昌分局所属各段各处，都严重的存在着资金大量积压现象。如该分局电务段存料价值十一亿以上，而实际只需一亿以上的材料就够周转。机务段第一次清点存料价值二十四亿以上，而实际只需二亿就够用了。积压了十倍以上的资金。有些材料根本就不是本单位需用的或急需用的。如电务段就有镀锌铁线一万二千五百多公斤，价值一亿五千万以上；硬铜线六百六十公斤，价值二千五百万以上。因为没有建设任务，就一直摆在仓库里。
    与清理库存同时，分局所属线路职工在“路料回家”、“废料大翻身”的口号下，为国家搜集了大批的宝贵财产。如分局工务段收集了一千九百多根钢轨，可以修十几公里的铁路；轮渡处收集了十六吨旧钢板；长沙桥煤厂收集了值二十亿元以上的材料（桥梁钢板等）；机务段清出了五六十吨“废料”；检车段清出了八十八吨“废料”，价值一亿二千多万元。有的工人说：“几十年没有动过的东西，这次都翻了身！”而这些“废料”有的是可以用的
    （如电务段就在“废料”里找出一百多公斤铁丝，价值三百多万元），有的是须经过加工才可以用的，有的是须要重新回炉的。
    清理结果，使干部群众都懂得了爱护并合理使用资金的重要性。如机务段长说：过去不但群众不知道有多少家当，就连我们也是糊里糊涂的，现在心中才比较有数了，经济核算也有基础了！机务段有的工人说：“要是国家把我们积压的资金运用起来，不是又可添十个机务段吗？”工人群众的认识提高以后，对国家的财产就很重视。如电务段有的工人说：“过去没有材料就不干活，现在要打打算盘，利用旧的材料了。”检车段有些工人把埋在地下的东西挖出来，并说：“这都是国家的财产呀！”此外，工人还自觉地献纳了不少器材。
