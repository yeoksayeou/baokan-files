The Party Guarantees Our Victory
    Li Wen, Chao Qi
    On August 4th, we went to a model anti-US, aid-Korea squad of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    Before we even spoke to the soldiers, we could see their optimism and their strong confidence in victory from the facilities in their barracks. The camp was so close to the enemy that short-range artillery could reach it, yet they were building their lives as if they were not in a war environment.
    The barracks, built by the soldiers themselves, were spread out along both banks of a small river, some housing a whole squad and others half a squad. Beside the door of each room was a wooden frame with neatly arranged mouthwash cups, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap. In the woods were many rectangular tables and benches made of rough wood, covered with two pieces of tarpaulin. Whether it was sunny or raining, the soldiers ate, held meetings, played chess, or played cards there. Square cages woven from silvery aluminum wire hung from the branches, containing eating utensils and canned goods. The fourth squad even built two underground "spittoons" next to the dining table. Looking at all this, we couldn't help but exclaim, "You've turned the mountain gully into a paradise!"
    Instructor Xu took us to the fourth squad. The fourth squad's Party group leader, Little Wang, and a soldier came out to greet us warmly. Little Wang quickly spread out the tarpaulin, took out a clean white sheet from his bedding, and invited us to rest on the "kang" (platform bed) and dry our wet clothes in the sun.
    "Little Wang, you've built a really nice home here!"
    "We like it this way. We not only build our own, but sometimes we also help the people repair their houses. As soon as the war is over, we can help the people rebuild all the houses here that were destroyed by the enemy within a month!" His little eyes sparkled with the light of victory, and he finished his first post-war wish in one breath.
    It rained heavily before dark. When the soldiers returned from repairing fortifications, they were soaked to the bone. But they were still singing songs so cheerfully, as if they had just come back from a pleasant bath in the river.
    In the evening, we slept on the same "kang" with Gao Wangong, which made it easier to talk.
    We thought: Now is the rainy season in Korea, it rains two out of every three days, the river ditches swell, and the roads are muddy. The soldiers not only brave the heavy rain to fight and dig fortifications, but also often carry grain for dozens of miles, sometimes even eating wild vegetables to survive. How difficult it is! But how did Gao Wangong tell us? He said, "Of course! If it weren't difficult, where would our glory come from? But the people's soldiers are not afraid of hardship. As long as we put forward the slogan of 'striving for merit,' the enthusiasm comes, and the difficulties are overcome! You don't know how we understand this issue. The soldiers often say: Earning merit now is very different from earning merit at home. We are fighting on behalf of the wishes of the people of our motherland and the people of the world. Every mountain and every house we seize will attract worldwide attention. This is 'international merit.' If we don't earn merit, we will be letting down the people of our motherland and the people of the world..."
    "There is one more important point," a soldier in the corner took over Gao Wangong's words: "There are many excellent Communist Party members in our squad. For example, Platoon Leader Gao - the original squad leader, Wang Kechuan - the original Party group leader, the later squad leader (now transferred to the division headquarters to study), He Bochao (now hospitalized), and Wang Guoqiang, Zhao Xuechen... No matter when or what they do, they are always the first to do it, and they lead our squad to victory!"
    "That's right!" Gao Wangong said.
    The fact is indeed so. During the Huangcaoling battle, it was much more difficult than it is now: the mountains were high, the snow was deep, the wind was strong, and enemy planes were harassing us. But as soon as we heard that we were chasing and annihilating the US "ace" army, everyone's enthusiasm came! Yang Tongcai's two heels were blistered, with big blisters over small blisters, and he was sweating with pain. He said to the "little instructor," "He Bochao, I'm really in too much pain!"
    He Bochao was called "little instructor" by everyone because he was not only brave and good at fighting, but also had a set of political mobilization methods and was a talented ballad singer. Even when he was in the hospital, he kept writing letters back to encourage the soldiers and made specific demands on each Party member. Once, the troops were chasing fleeing enemies, and the company hadn't eaten for two days. Gao Wangong got earth eggs (potatoes) from the quartermaster, three for each person. Wan Zhixiang burned them all. Everyone ate the burned earth eggs happily, and He Bochao immediately sang a ballad: "Ninety-two rice, eighty-one noodles, can't compare to our burnt earth eggs... Cross icy lakes, climb snowy mountains, endure hunger and cold to annihilate the enemy! No matter how great the difficulties, they can't stop our heroes! Speaking of where the difficulties come from, they were given to us by the American devils... Eliminate the American invaders and thoroughly liberate all of Korea. Who is a hero, who is a model, we'll see it on the merit list." He raised the morale of the entire company very high. Now, it was his time to show his talent again. He said to Little Yang:
    "Little Yang, didn't you tell me that you wanted to test yourself in Korea and strive to join the Party? This is also a way!" As soon as the Party was mentioned, Little Yang perked up and was filled with strength, continuing to move forward - although he was walking very slowly. Gao Wangong saw that Little Yang was about to fall behind, so he called a group meeting during the break. He said:
    "Can a Communist Party member guarantee that he will fall behind? Where are our Party members?" So, Wang Guoqiang snatched Little Yang's luggage and carried it on his back, and Wang Kechuan carried him on his back. Walking, walking, the more Little Yang walked, the sadder he felt, and later he asked to walk on his own.
    Gao Wangong then talked about Wang Kechuan. He said that he was a Party member who could most influence and lead the masses with his practical actions. Wang Kechuan never uttered a word in any difficult situation. While marching, he had malaria for three consecutive days without telling anyone, and he even rushed to carry Little Yang. When he lived in Dechuanli, he saw that the old landlord was wearing too little clothing, so he took the lead in helping the old man go up the mountain to chop firewood and fetch water. The old man was very moved and sent us apples. But who would eat them! In Hamhung, they hadn't eaten for two days and lived in an apple orchard. The apples were fat and fragrant, but no one touched an apple. It wasn't until the third day, when the medic was resting with him, that he discovered that his face was green, he had goosebumps, and he was shivering. "What's wrong? Wang Kechuan," the medic asked. "I have malaria, this is the third day." "Why didn't you tell the squad leader?" "Why tell him? Ask them to help me carry my luggage? Or ask them to persuade me to stay in the rear? I won't do it!" He argued with the medic as if he didn't care. Wang Kechuan told people everything, even how he begged for food when he was a child. However, he kept this matter a secret. It was the same when marching towards the 38th parallel. He carried eighty pounds of luggage and sprained his leg while climbing the mountain, but he didn't say a word. When the instructor and political instructor persuaded him to go to the hospital, he burst into tears. He said, "I will follow the team even if I have to crawl!"
    "You see, how tenacious he is! Under his influence, no one in our march fell behind," Gao Wangong concluded his story in a very admiring tone.
                    × × ×
    When it came to fighting, like all the soldiers we met, Gao Wangong became even more excited.
    This company had only fought two battles: the first battle was in Fenghaili (in South Hamgyong Province), chasing and annihilating the 1st Marine Division of the United States; the second battle was to block the enemy on Height 298 on the west side of the south bank of the Imjin River.
    On the day of the battle in Fenghaili, the fourth squad was resting with the battalion headquarters in a mountain gully. The political instructor told Gao Wangong that they would receive a combat mission that evening.
    "Doesn't that put us at the front?" Gao Wangong was happy to hear that they were fighting the American army.
    "We are still studying it," the political instructor replied.
    The long-awaited battle finally came, and Gao Wangong couldn't contain his inner joy. He returned to the squad and said to everyone, "Comrades, I have good news for you - the battalion will receive a combat mission tonight." He Bochao immediately jumped out of the bedding: "Let's go! Let's go get the mission." So, everyone followed him to the political instructor. The political instructor ordered them to cross the river at night to seize the bridgehead position. They were so excited that they couldn't calm down and anxiously waited for dark. Gao Wangong convened a squad meeting to discuss how to complete the mission. After that, Wang Kechuan left the Party members behind to hold a group meeting, and then wrote a letter of determination to the branch: to ensure that Party members play a leading role and ensure that all non-Party soldiers are brought along. But when they arrived at the designated location at the designated time, the enemy had already run away.
    "They don't dare to resist, they just run away, what kind of 'ace army' is that?" Some people sarcastically ridiculed the enemy in anger.
    Just as they were feeling disappointed, the battalion headquarters ordered them to chase forward. The company asked the first platoon to walk in front, and the second platoon was unhappy. The instructor came to comfort them and said, "Get ready, there are plenty of opportunities." They chased forward at the fastest speed, and after walking about sixty li, they clearly heard the tanks of the enemy wailing. "Caught up!" Everyone jumped up happily.
    The task of the fourth squad was to attack from the front. In front of them was a river more than three meters wide. The river water was covered with a thin layer of ice, which poured into their leather shoes. They didn't feel cold at all, and rushed forward with all their might. Just as they stuck their heads out of the river ditch to observe, He Bochao had already spotted someone in front.
    "Who?" he asked.
    "Our own people!"
    This sudden Chinese language made them suspicious. At that time, Gao Wangong thought like this: The superiors clearly said that they were fighting the American army, where did the Chinese come from? At the same time, it was clear that we were the vanguard of the entire division, where did the "own people" come from? Isn't this a ghost? He thought for a moment - about five seconds, and said to everyone: "It can't be our own people. Be vigilant!..." Before he finished speaking, the plane dropped a flare, which was bright and clear, which helped him judge the situation. He looked ahead, and wasn't that right! A dozen machine guns were pointing at them; within a distance of more than twenty meters, there were four barbed wire fences. The enemy concentrated fire on the left and right wings. "We must be very close to the enemy!" He thought in his heart.
    The instructor came over from the left wing and asked urgently in a low voice, "Is that squad leader of the fourth squad?"
    "Yes!"
    "If you want to be a model squad, rush up and seize the machine gun position!"
    "Is there any need to ask!" Gao Wangong used a sentence to replace his determination. He counted the number of people, six people, one machine gun - the group led by Zhao Xuechen had not yet caught up. He said: "Comrades: The time has come to earn merit for the people of the world. Charge!" They used the terrain of the dead corner to crawl, and threw three rounds of grenades in a row, suppressing part of the enemy's machine guns. Stirring the barbed wire with guns, they rushed up. The enemy was trapped in a three-sided attack, in chaos, and began to run backwards in groups. He Bochao was anxious, his eyes were red, and he stood up to fight. As soon as the first grenade went out, a bullet hit his right shoulder blade. He felt a sting like a bee sting, but he continued to fight, but when he threw the third grenade, he couldn't lift his arm, and he knew he was injured. Gao Wangong came over and asked him to go down for bandaging. He said: "Squad leader! I am a Party member, I can't go down first. I will resolutely defend this breakthrough with my left hand and throw grenades, and I will not let the enemy counterattack; I must persist until the rear troops come up. Rush up to occupy the commanding height, quickly!" The soldiers regarded him as a banner, and proposed "Learn from He Bochao!" "Follow the example of Little Instructor!" They quickly occupied the commanding height. From the beginning of the battle to the end of the battle, it took less than thirty minutes. The fourth squad killed more than twenty enemies and captured eight heavy machine guns - not counting the ones that were destroyed.
    The second battle was much more intense than the first. The task of their company was to ensure the safety of the left wing of the fraternal troops. On that day, the entire company basically fought the battle with the fourth squad, and strictly speaking, the fourth squad basically fought the battle with Wang Kechuan's group. The battle was fierce from the start. The enemy began with a company's force to attack, and later increased to three companies' force, but they never came up.
    "We mainly rely on will - an eternally invincible will to win!" Gao Wangong said loudly, "Li Jinshan (Party member) was wounded twice and did not leave the front line. When the enemy attacked for the third time, his left shoulder blade was injured - because he stood up, fresh blood was flowing down. I asked him to come down. He said: 'It doesn't matter, I have told the Party: minor injuries do not leave the front line, serious injuries do not cry. I still have my right hand, and I still want revenge!' Then he was wounded in the right leg, and not a tear fell. Zhang Chaoyuan (non-Party member) saw that Li Jinshan was still fighting calmly after being injured, so he simply jumped out of the fortifications to fight. Wang Kechuan pulled him in, but he couldn't pull him. When his left arm was injured, he still shouted 'Learn from Li Jinshan!' In this way, some of our comrades endured the pain of being wounded and bleeding, fulfilled their tasks to the Party and the people, defeated the enemy's five consecutive attacks, killed and wounded more than 100 enemies, and persisted in the position according to the instructions of the superiors."

     党保证我们走向胜利
    力文  超祺
    八月四日，我们到人民志愿军某部的抗美援朝模范班去。
    我们没有和战士们谈话以前，就从他们的营房设备上看到他们的乐观情绪，看到他们坚强的胜利信心。营地离敌人那样近，以至短距离炮可以打过来，而他们却好像没有在战争的环境下一样地建设着自己的生活。
    战士们自己盖的营房，沿着小河两岸摆开，有的一间可以住一个班，有的住半个班。每间房屋的门旁有一个木架子，上面整齐地摆着口盅、牙刷、牙膏和肥皂。树林里有着许多用粗木头做成的长方形桌子和凳子，顶上用两块雨布盖着，不论是天晴或下雨，战士们都在那里吃饭，开会，下棋或打扑克牌。用银色的铝丝织成的方形笼子挂在树枝上，里面盛装着吃饭用具和罐头。四班还在饭桌旁边修了两个地下“痰盂”。看了这一切，我们不由自主地喊道：“简直把山沟变成乐园了！”
    徐指导员带我们去四班。四班的党小组长小王和一位战士从屋内迎出来，热情地招呼我们。小王迅速地把雨布铺开，从被包里取出洁白的被单来，叫我们上“炕”去休息，把湿衣服脱下来晒。
    “小王，你们把这个家建设的真不错啊！”
    “我们喜欢这样。我们不仅建设自己的，有时还帮助老百姓修理房子。只要战争结束了，我们可以在一个月内帮助老百姓把这里被敌人毁坏的房子统统修建起来！”他的小眼睛闪烁着胜利的光芒，一口气就说完了战后的第一个心愿。
    天黑以前下了很大的雨。战士们修工事回来的时候，全身都湿透了。但他们仍是那么快活地唱着歌子，仿佛刚从河里洗一个愉快的澡回来一样。
    晚上我们和高万功睡在一个“炕”上，这样就方便谈话啦。
    我们想：现在正是朝鲜雨季，三天下两天雨，河沟水涨，道路又烂，战士们不仅冒着倾盆大雨作战、挖工事，并且常常走几十里路扛粮食，有时甚至吃野菜度日，这是多么艰苦啊！可是，高万功怎样对我们说的呢？他说：“当然啊！不艰苦我们的光荣又从那里来呢？但人民的战士就不怕艰苦哩。我们只要提出‘争取立功’的口号，劲头就来啦，困难也就克服啦！你们可不知道我们怎样认识这个问题。战士们常说：现在立功和在国内立功大不一样，我们是代表着祖国人民和世界人民的心愿来打仗的，我们夺得一山一屋，都会引起全世界注意，这就是‘国际功’。不立功就对不起祖国人民和世界人民了。……”
    “还有一条顶重要的”，在角落里的一位战士把高万功的话接过来：“我们班有许多优秀的共产党员：譬如说，高排长——原来的班长，王克传——原来的党小组长，后来的班长（现在调到师部去学习了），何伯超（现在住院了），还有王国强，赵学臣……，不论在什么时候，做什么工作，他们都是干在前头的，他们带领我们班走向胜利！”
    “对！”高万功说。
    事实确是这样。在黄草岭的时候，比现在艰苦得多：山高，雪深，风大，敌机扰乱，可是一听到追歼美国“王牌”军的时候，大家的劲头就来啦！杨通材的两只脚后跟磨起了泡，大泡套小泡，痛得他直冒汗。他对“小指导员”说：“何伯超，我实在痛得不成！”
    何伯超被大家称为“小指导员”，是因为他不仅勇敢善战，而且有一套政治鼓动办法，又是一个天才的说快板的艺人。就是在住医院的时候，仍不断地写信回来鼓励，对每个党员提出具体要求。有一次，部队在追歼逃敌，连里两天没吃上饭。高万功从事务长那里领来地蛋（土豆），每人三个。万致祥把它们都烤焦了。大家愉快地吃着地蛋，何伯超立即唱了一个快板：“九二米，八一面，那能比咱焦地蛋……。渡过冰湖爬雪山，忍饥挨冻把敌歼！天大困难也克服，难不住咱英雄汉！再说困难那里来，也是美国鬼子给的咱。……消灭美国侵略军，彻底解放全朝鲜。谁是英雄谁模范，咱们功劳榜上见。”把全连的情绪搞得很高涨。现在，又是他大显才能的时候了。他对小杨说：
    “小杨，你不是对我说过吗？要在朝鲜考验自己，争取入党吗？这也是一条哩！”一提到党，小杨就振作起来，混身充满了力量，继续前进——当然是走得很慢的。高万功看小杨的情形非掉队不可了，在休息的时候，召开了一个小组会，他说：
    “有共产党员保证能掉队吗？我们的党员那儿去了？”于是，王国强抢去了小杨的行李背上，王克传背着他走。走呀！走呀！越走小杨心里越难过，后来就要求自己走啦。
    高万功又谈起王克传。他说他是一个最能以实际行动影响和带领群众的党员。王克传在任何的困难情形下，从没吭过一声。在行军时，他连发三天疟疾没告诉任何人，还抢着背小杨走。住在德川里的时候，看见房东老大爷穿衣服太薄，他又带头帮老乡上山打柴，打水。老大爷很受感动，送苹果给我们。可是谁肯吃啊！在咸兴的时候，他们两天没吃饭，住在一个苹果园里，苹果又肥又香，但没人摸过一个苹果。直到第三天卫生员跟他一起休息的时候才发现：他的脸发青，起鸡皮，打哆嗦。“怎么样啦？王克传。”卫生员问。“发疟疾，这是第三天了。”“为什么不告诉班长呢？”“为什么告诉他？叫他们帮我背行李？或者叫他们劝我留在后方吗？我可不干！”他满不以为然地和卫生员吵起来。王克传什么话都对人说，连他小时候讨饭吃的情形都说了。可是，这件事却就瞒起来。在向“三八”线进军的时候也是一样。他挑八十斤行李，爬山时摔歪了腿，也是一声不吭。指导员和教导员劝他住院的时候，他却呜呜地哭开了。他说：“爬着我也要跟队伍走！”
    “你看，多顽强呀！在他的影响下，我们在行军中没有一个人掉队。”高万功以十分钦佩的语调把他的话告了一段落。
                    ×  ×  ×
    谈到打仗的事啦，像我们碰到的所有战士一样，高万功更加兴奋起来。
    这个连仅打过两仗：第一仗在凤贺里（在咸镜南道），追歼美国海军陆战队第一师；第二仗在临津江南岸西片山二九八高地阻击敌人。
    在凤贺里战斗的那天，四班正和营部在一个山沟里休息。教导员告诉高万功晚上接受战斗任务。
    “那还不给我们在前头吗？”高万功一听说打的是美军，心眼里就高兴。
    “我们正在研究。”教导员答。
    早就盼望的战斗终于来了，高万功关不住内心的高兴，回到班上就对大家说：“同志们，告诉你们
    一个好消息——营里今晚接受战斗任务。”何伯超马上从被窝里跳出来：“走！去领任务去。”于是，大家就跟着他到了教导员那里。教导员命令他们在夜里淌过河去夺取桥头阵地。他们兴奋得不能安静下来，焦急地盼着天黑。高万功召开班会议，研究如何能完成任务以后，王克传把党员留下来开小组会，然后向支部写了一个决心书：保证党员起带头作用，保证把所有的非党战士都带上。但是当他们按照指定的时间到达指定的位置时，敌人已经跑了。
    “不敢抵抗，光跑，算什么‘王牌军’啊？”有的人气愤地讽刺敌人。
    正在他们感到失望的时候，营部下命令往前追。连里叫一排走在前头，二排都不高兴。指导员来安慰他们说：“你们准备好，有的是机会。”他们用最快的速度往前追，约走了六十里，就清清楚楚地听到敌人坦克呜呜地叫。“赶上了！”大家高兴得跳起来。
    四班的任务是从正面攻击。在他们前面有一道三公尺多宽的河。河水结着一层薄冰，灌进皮鞋里，他们一点也没感到冷，只是一股劲儿往前冲。正当他们从河沟里伸出头来视察时，何伯超已发现前面有人。
    “谁？”他问。
    “自己人！”
    这突如其来的中国话，使得他们疑惑起来。那时高万功这样想：上级明明说打的是美国军，那儿来的中国人？同时明明说我们是全师的先头部队，又那儿来的“自己人”呢？岂不是见鬼吗？他想了一想——大约有五秒钟，对大家说：“不会是自己人。提高警惕！……”还没说完话，飞机扔下一个照明弹，亮通通的，这可帮助他判断情况啦。他朝前一看，可不是吗！十几挺机枪正对着他们摆着；在二十多公尺的距离内，有四道铁丝网隔着。敌人集中火力向左右两翼射击。“大约我们离敌人很近了！”他心里想。
    指导员从左翼过来，急促地细声地问：“是四班长吗？”
    “是！”
    “如果想当模范班，冲上去夺取机枪阵地！”
    “那还用着问吗！”高万功用一句话代替他的决心。他点一下人数，六个人，一挺机枪——赵学臣带的那个组还没赶上来。他说：“同志们：为世界人民立功的时候到了。冲啊！”他们利用死角的地形爬着，一连扔了三遍手榴弹，把敌人的一部分机枪压住了。用枪搅开铁丝网，他们冲了上去。敌人陷在三面被攻中，乱了，一股一股地开始往后跑。何伯超心里着急，眼红了，站起来打。第一颗手榴弹刚出去，一粒子弹打中了他的右肩胛，他觉得像蜂螫一样刺痛了一下，还是继续地打，但扔到第三个手榴弹的时候，手臂抬不起来了，才知道负了伤。高万功过来叫他下去包扎。他说：“班长！我是党员，不能先下去。我用左手扔手榴弹也坚决守住这突破口，不让敌人反攻过来；要坚持到后面部队上来。冲上去占领制高点，赶快！”战士们把他当做一面旗帜，提出“向何伯超学习！”“向小指导员看齐！”他们很快地占领了制高点。从开始打响到战斗结束，不到三十分钟。四班共打死敌人二十余名，缴获重机枪八挺——打坏的不算。
    第二次战斗比第一次猛烈得多。他们连的任务是保证兄弟部队左翼的安全。那一天，全连基本上是四班打的仗，而严格地说来，四班基本上是王克传那一组打的仗。战斗从开始就很激烈，敌人开始用一连兵力进攻，后来增加到三个连的兵力，但始终没有攻上来。
    “我们主要是依靠意志——永远不可战胜的意志打胜的！”高万功高声地说，“李金山（党员）负伤两次不下火线。敌人第三次进攻的时候，他的左肩胛负伤了——因为站起来的缘故，鲜血直流下来。我叫他下来。他说：‘不要紧，我曾对党表示：轻伤不下火线，重伤不哭。我还有右手，还要报仇！’接着他又被打伤了右腿，一滴眼泪没有掉。张朝元（非党员）看见李金山挂了彩仍沉着战斗，他干脆跳出工事来打。王克传拉他进来也拉不动。当他左臂负伤的时候，仍高呼着‘向李金山看齐！’就这样啊，我们有的同志忍受着负伤流血的痛楚，对党对人民履行了自己的任务，打垮敌人的连续五次进攻，杀伤敌人一百多人，按照上级的指示坚持了阵地。”
