Our motherland has never been so beautiful, strong, and great as it is today! It appears before us with its forest of red flags like a sea of flames, with its surging crowds of people, with its invincible armed forces on land, sea, and air, with its powerful ranks of workers and peasants, with its vibrant tens of thousands of young people and children...showing its limitless future, making everyone proud to have such a great motherland! Everyone has never embraced the motherland so closely as today!

We saw the ranks of students from various military schools, we saw the magnificent ranks of the world-renowned Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army, and we saw for the first time that we have so many and such mighty airplanes, artillery, tanks, and other new-style weapons. We saw combat heroes from the Korean battlefield, people's representatives from various old revolutionary base areas, and labor models from factories, mines, and railways across the country. Everyone was pleasantly surprised by the tremendous progress and magnificent achievements that the motherland has made in just two short years!

Here is Li Shunda—a nationally renowned agricultural labor model. When a large group of planes appeared in the sky, he carefully counted them one by one. He said that he had also come last year, but this year is very different. Zhang Zifu, a labor model from the Fushun Coal Mine, also enthusiastically praised the motherland as "greater year by year." He was particularly excited about the strength shown by the troops. He said, "With such strength, we are not afraid of the United States failing!" Wang Zhaomei, another labor model with him, said, "It's not just different year by year, it's different day by day—perhaps even more than that, it's different moment by moment; we should also continue to improve." Ma Hengchang, one of the banners of the nation's workers, also came last year. He also said that the changes are too great, "almost unbelievable."

Old soldiers who used spears, muskets, and earthen cannons to fight the enemy in the past, after seeing all kinds of troops and those new-style weapons, couldn't help but say: We defeated the enemy with earthen guns, now that we have such powerful armed forces, how can the enemy not be defeated! Lin Deqing, a former political instructor of a company in the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army from Xingguo County, the old revolutionary base area in Jiangxi, told the Volunteer Army comrades standing with him watching the parade: "In the past, several Red Army soldiers shared one gun, and each person had only two or three bullets; today we have developed to such an extent, with air force, navy, jets, and rocket launchers, it is not difficult to liberate Taiwan!" Liu Shaohuan, who used to be a Red Army propagandist and is now retired due to injury like Lin Deqing, also said with confidence: "With such strength, we can defeat any enemy!"

Fan Jinghai, a sixty-nine-year-old veteran from the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, also said that when he fought the Japanese, several people shared one gun, and they only had five bullets, one of which was a "dud." Shi Guofan, another veteran of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, interjected: "Now our cannons are as big as water tanks and can turn the American devils into mud!" Granny Lu, who once sheltered the martyr Zhao Yiman and is known as the "Mother of the Anti-Japanese Alliance," said: "The Americans rely on their airplanes, artillery, and tanks, but now we have so many too, no wonder they are becoming more and more unable to resist. If Zhao Yiman, Zhao Shangzhi, and those old comrades were still alive today, how happy they would be!" She was especially happy to see the young people in the ranks, and she excitedly praised them: "They are all young people, class after class, with people and guns, invincible in the world! I am already fifty-six years old, but after seeing this today, I feel twenty years younger!"

The heroes of the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army listened with great interest to the stories of these old comrades and elders. They all felt that this was a glorious and great revolutionary tradition; and this tradition was cultivated successfully by Chairman Mao. Therefore, whether it was them or the revolutionary fighters in the old areas, after a few words, they would naturally talk about Chairman Mao. They were filled with infinite respect and love for the great and wise leader Chairman Mao. They kept cheering "Long live Chairman Mao!" This name is our common language, representing our common confidence, will, and hope, this name symbolizes the source of all our strength! The power of the Chinese people is great, but this power can only be brought into play under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. When we saw him appear on the Tiananmen reviewing stand, we all looked at him, saluted him, and cheered. We all wanted to take another look at him, to examine him more carefully, and we kept turning our heads as we passed the reviewing stand. We liked to see his kind smile and cheerful face. A representative of the bereaved families of martyrs from Heilongjiang, who was over seventy years old and never sang, couldn't help but sing along with others this time after seeing Chairman Mao. Wang Kecheng, a representative of the bereaved families of martyrs from Changting County, western Fujian, took out a photo of Chairman Mao taken with the main cadres in Jinggangshan and a photo of the Second National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers from his cherished pocket to show everyone. He pointed to these two photos and said: "Compared to the past, the revolutionary force is countless times greater, how great Chairman Mao's leadership is!"

In addition to the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army, our militia was also one of the most noteworthy parts of today's review of strength. They wore their original simple peasant clothes, with towels wrapped around their heads. Their serious, simple, and spirited faces, and the rifles on their shoulders, all gave people a deep impression. From them, people saw the source of our great military strength. Whether it is the armored forces on land, the air force flying jets in the air, or the navy sailing ships at sea, they will not forget that they have developed from here.

We cheer for today, and we also cheer for tomorrow! Cheer for the future!

Marching forward lively and bravely are our teams of young pioneers. They are so lovely, they are liked by all people. They carry models of cattle, sheep, minerals, rice, wheat, and various products forward. They carry signs marking the numbers of China's population and land area forward. They use these to express their love for their motherland. They also carry models of airplanes, tanks, and agricultural machinery to express their determination to defend this lovely motherland and their desire to work hard for the motherland's production and construction. They hold books and sports equipment to show that they are now working hard to study and strengthen their physique. Every one of their faces is filled with happy and joyful smiles, constantly looking towards Tiananmen Square and cheering "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

All our workers, peasants, troops, and students understand internationalism, understand loving the working people of the world, and uniting with them. They carry forward portraits of the great leaders of our brother countries. Our international democratic and peaceful camp is powerful and invincible. On the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we saw so many international friends that we did not see last year. At the same time, representatives of some countries saw for the first time the great strength and new atmosphere of New China. It has already formed an unbreakable fortress with the great socialist country of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries and other peace-loving people in the world. The people of the East are celebrating today that such a powerful country has appeared in Asia, celebrating one of mankind's most brilliant festivals.

As night fell, the streets and alleys of Beijing were once again filled with crowds of people. From Tiananmen Square to Zhengyangmen, from Dong Sanzuomen to Xi Sanzuomen, there were crowds of people everywhere. Loudspeakers in the square broadcast happy songs; fireworks released various rainbows; searchlights of various colors wove various patterns in the sky. The joy of the people is indescribable, but they all said in unison: "I saw Chairman Mao during the day!" "I saw so many airplanes and cannons, and I am completely convinced that our strength is invincible." They joined dozens of open-air dances hand in hand. Soldiers, workers, students, staff, and international friends danced and laughed together. People everywhere were singing loudly: "The East is red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong." The people dancing also sang the song "Looking for Friends." Like the joyous atmosphere of a family, it enveloped the square with hundreds of thousands of people. Until dawn, there were still people dancing and singing in the square.

    青春的祖国，无穷的力量！
    本报记者
    我们的祖国从来没有像今天这样的美丽，坚强，伟大！它出现在我们面前，以它的一片火焰似的红旗的森林，以它的奔腾的人流，以它的陆上的、海上的、空中的不可战胜的武装力量，以它的工人和农民的强大队伍，以它的朝气勃勃的成千成万的青年和少年儿童，……显示着它的无限前途，使每一个人都为自己有这样一个伟大的祖国而感到光荣！每一个人从来没有像今天这样和祖国更亲密地拥抱在一起！
    我们看见各种军事学校学员的队伍，我们看见举世闻名的志愿军和人民解放军的雄壮行列，我们更第一次看见了我们有这样多又这样威武的飞机、大炮、坦克和其他新式武器。我们看见了来自朝鲜战场的战斗英雄，来自各老根据地的人民代表，来自各地工厂、矿山、铁路的劳动模范。大家都惊喜于祖国在短促的两年中已经有了这样巨大的进展，这样雄伟的成就！
    这里是李顺达——全国闻名的农业劳动模范。当天空出现了大群飞机的时候，他仔细地一架一架数着，他说他去年也来过，可是今年大不同了。抚顺煤矿的劳动模范张子富也热烈地赞美祖国“一年比一年伟大”，他对部队所显示的力量特别感到兴奋。他说：“我们有这样的力量，不怕美国不败！”和他在一起的另一个劳动模范王兆梅说：“这不只是一年比一年不同，这是一天比一天不同——恐怕还不止这样，这是一时比一时不同；我们也应该不断进步才好。”全国工人的旗帜之一马恒昌，去年也来过，他也说变化太大了，“几乎不相信自己的眼睛”。
    过去使用梭标、火枪、土炮和敌人作过战的老战士看见各种各样的部队和那些新式武器，不由得都这样说：用土枪都打败了敌人，现在有了这样强大的武装，敌人那有不败的！从江西老革命根据地兴国县来的、当过中国工农红军的连政治指导员的林德庆，告诉和他站在一起观礼的志愿军同志说：“过去红军几个人合使一枝枪，每一个人只有两三发子弹；今天我们发展到这样个地步，又有空军，又有海军，有喷气式，又有火箭炮，要解放台湾也不难啊！”做过红军宣传员，现在和林德庆一样因受伤退伍的刘绍桓也充满信心地说：“这样的力量，把什么敌人都能打倒！”
    从东北来的过去抗日联军中的老战士、今年六十九岁的范景海也说，他那时候打日本人，几个人使一枝枪，只有五颗子弹，其中有一颗还是“瞎火”。另一个抗日联军的老战士史国藩插进来说：“现在我们的大炮有水缸一样大，可以把美国鬼子打成烂泥浆！”一位曾经掩护过赵一曼烈士、被称为“抗联的母亲”的吕老太太说道：“老美就靠他有飞机、大炮、坦克，现在我们也有这么多了，怪不得它越发招架不住。今天要是赵一曼、赵尚志那些老同志都活着，他们该多么高兴啊！”她特别高兴看见行列里的青年人，她兴奋地赞美着：“都是年轻人，一班一班的，连人加枪，万国无敌！我已经五十六岁，今天看了，年青了二十年！”
    志愿军和人民解放军的英雄们很有兴趣地听着这些老同志、老前辈们的故事，他们都感到这是光荣伟大的革命传统；而这个传统，就是毛主席所培育成功的。因此无论是他们，或者是老区的革命战士们，几句话一谈，很自然地都会谈到毛主席。他们对伟大英明的领袖毛主席充满了无限的尊敬和热爱。他们不断欢呼“毛主席万岁！”这名字是我们的共同的语言，代表着我们的共同的信心、意志和希望，这名字象征着我们的一切力量的源泉！中国人民群众的力量是伟大的，但是这个力量只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能够发挥出来。当我们看见他出现在天安门检阅台上时，我们一齐向他注目，向他敬礼，欢呼。我们都想多看他一眼，更仔细地端详他，走过检阅台还频频回头，我们喜欢看他的慈祥的微笑、愉快的容颜。黑龙江一位七十多岁的烈属代表从来就不唱歌，这次见了毛主席，竟也不由自主地跟着人家唱起来了。闽西长汀县烈属代表王克成拿出他珍藏怀里的一幅毛主席在井冈山与那时的主要干部合摄的照片和工农兵第二次全国代表大会的照片来给大家看。他指着这两幅照片说：“当年和现在相比，革命的力量不知大了多少，毛主席的领导是多么伟大啊！”
    除了志愿军解放军之外，我们的民兵也是在今天这力量的检阅中最受注意的一个部分。他们穿着原来的朴素的农民服装，头上包了手巾，他们的严肃质朴和精神饱满的脸孔，他们肩上所背的步枪，都给人以深刻的印象。从他们身上，人们看到了我们伟大的军事力量的泉源。不论是在陆上的装甲部队，在空中驾驶喷气式飞机的空军，和在海上驾驶船舰的海军，他们都不会忘记他们是从这里发展起来的。
    我们欢呼今天，我们也要欢呼明天！欢呼将来！
    活泼勇敢地前进着的是我们的少年儿童队伍。他们是那样地可爱，他们得到了所有人们的喜欢。他们抬着牛、羊、矿产、稻、麦、各种物产的模型前进，他们抬着标明中国人口和领土面积的数字的牌子前进，他们用这些来表示他们热爱他们的祖国。他们也抬着飞机、坦克以及农业器械的模型来表示他们有保卫这可爱的祖国的决心和为祖国的生产建设而努力的志愿。他们拿着书本和运动器具，来表示他们现在正在努力学习，锻炼体格。他们的每一张脸庞都展开着愉快幸福的笑容，不住地向天安门眺望，向毛主席欢呼万岁！
    我们所有的工人、农民、部队、学生都懂得国际主义，懂得爱全世界劳动人民，并且和他们团结起来。他们抬着我们兄弟国家的伟大领袖像前进。我们的国际的民主和平的阵营是强大无敌的。在建国第二周年的今天，我们看到了去年所没有看到的这样多的国际友人。同时，好些国家的代表也还是第一次看见新中国的伟大的力量和新的气象。它已经和伟大的社会主义国家苏联和各人民民主国家及世界其他爱好和平的人民结成一个牢不可破的堡垒。东方人民今天正庆贺着亚洲出现了这样强大的一个国家，庆贺着人类的最灿烂的节日之一。
    在夜幕低垂的时候，北京的大街小巷又涌满了人流。从天安门到正阳门，从东三座门到西三座门，到处是人山人海。广场上的扩音机播送着快乐的歌曲；焰火放出各种虹彩；各种颜色的探照灯在天空织成各种花纹。人们的欢乐是说不尽的，但他们都不约而同地说：“我在白天看见了毛主席！”“我看到那么多飞机大炮，完全确信我们的力量是无敌的。”他们手携手地投入了几十个露天舞会中去了。战士、工人、学生、工作人员、国际友人在一起跳着、笑着。人们到处在高唱：“东方红、太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东。”跳舞的人们还唱着“找朋友”的歌。像一个家庭的欢乐气氛，笼罩着这几十万人的广场。直到天色微明，广场上还有人在跳舞歌唱。
