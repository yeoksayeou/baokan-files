    Supporting the Soviet Government's Statement
    The Soviet Statement Strikes at the American Imperialist Conspiracy
    To the Editor:
    After reading the Soviet government's statement to the U.S. government regarding the Korean situation and Soviet-American relations, we express our warm support and our utmost indignation at the shameless "oral statement" of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kirk.
    What a despicable thing it is, American imperialists are doing their best to dress themselves up as "peace envoys," singing the praises of peace, but they dare not take responsibility for their words, fearing that they will expose their aggressor's face. The shameless ugly face of imperialism is truly revealed here.
    American imperialism attempts to shift the blame for delaying the negotiations onto the Chinese and Korean people, while also playing its hooligan tricks on the Soviet Union. But everyone knows that it is American imperialism itself, and no one else, that is delaying and sabotaging the Kaesong armistice negotiations; it is also American imperialism that is actively arming Germany and Japan in an attempt to expand aggression. American imperialism's despicable attempt to deceive the people of the world with one hand has long been bankrupt!
    The Soviet statement once again powerfully strikes at American imperialism, and at the same time demonstrates the Soviet Union's unwavering efforts for the cause of world peace. We must use practical actions to support the Soviet statement, study hard, do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and strike at the imperialist aggressors!

    拥护苏联政府声明
    苏联的声明打击了美帝国主义的阴谋编辑同志：
    读了苏联政府关于朝鲜局势与苏美关系致美国政府的声明以后，我们表示热烈的拥护，并对美国驻苏大使寇克的无耻“口头声明”表示莫大的愤慨。
    这是多么卑劣的事情，美帝国主义者把自己竭力打扮成为一个“和平使者”，去唱和平的高调，但又不敢对自己的话负责，深恐暴露自己侵略者的面貌。帝国主义者的无耻丑态在这里真是毕露无遗了。
    美帝国主义企图将拖延谈判的罪责推卸在中朝人民身上，同时又向苏联耍它的流氓无赖手段。但是谁都知道，拖延、破坏开城停战谈判的正是美帝国主义自己而不是别人；积极武装德日企图扩大侵略的也正是美帝国主义。美帝国主义这种以一手掩尽天下人耳目的卑劣企图，是早就破产了！
    苏联的声明再一次有力地打击了美帝国主义，同时也表现了苏联对于世界和平事业的坚持不渝的努力。我们一定要用实际的行动来拥护苏联的声明，努力学习，做好抗美援朝工作，并随时准备响应祖国的号召，打击帝国主义侵略者！
