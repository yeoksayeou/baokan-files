    Can We Relax After Completing the Donation Plan?
    After the Third Village of Xinxing Township in Guanghan County, Western Sichuan, completed its production increase and donation plan, some cadres and farmers believed that "airplanes and cannons have been sent to the People's Volunteer Army, and the Resist America, Aid Korea work is almost done," so their emotions relaxed. The propagandists also felt that "there is nothing to publicize," and the masses were not as enthusiastic about reading newspapers as before.
    The township's Patriotic Public Agreement Implementation Committee promptly educated the village cadres and masses, corrected the relaxed mood, and revised the village's patriotic public agreement, with the main content being to expand the planting area of ​​winter crops, increase sideline production, hand in the autumn grain tax in an organized manner and all at once, strengthen the control of counter-revolutionaries, do a good job of substitute farming, and reorganize reading groups.
    Xinxing Township's timely strengthening of the leadership of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is correct. People from all walks of life in all regions should prevent the emergence of complacency after completing the donation plan.

    完成了捐献计划可以松口气吗？
    川西广汉县新兴乡第三村在完成了增产捐献计划之后，某些干部与农民认为“飞机大炮送给人民志愿军了，抗美援朝工作差不多了”，因此情绪就松懈下来。宣传员也感到“没有啥子可以宣传了”，群众读报也不如以前热烈。
    该乡爱国公约执行委员会及时向该村干部与群众进行了教育，纠正了松懈情绪，修订了全村的爱国公约，以扩大冬季作物种植面积、增加副业生产，有组织地一次交清秋征公粮，加强管制反革命分子，做好代耕工作，整顿读报组等为主要内容。
    新兴乡及时地加强抗美援朝运动的领导是正确的。各地各界人民在完成捐献计划之后，都应该防止产生松懈现象。
