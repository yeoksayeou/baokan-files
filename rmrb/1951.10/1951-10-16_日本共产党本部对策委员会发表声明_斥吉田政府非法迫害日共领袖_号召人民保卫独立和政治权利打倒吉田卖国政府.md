Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Tokyo Delayed News: The Japanese Communist Party Headquarters Countermeasures Committee issued a statement on September 8th, denouncing the Yoshida reactionary government's illegal order to arrest and purge 18 JCP leaders, including Shiino Etsuro. The statement said: This suppression measure is to block the voices against the separate peace treaty and the US-Japan "Security Treaty." The reactionaries are attempting to undermine the Japanese people's will to demand peace and independence by suppressing the JCP, and to suppress the people's movement in Japan. The statement pointed out: The reactionaries will continue to suppress the JCP, and are prepared to brutally and cruelly suppress all groups and individuals who oppose the permanent stationing of foreign troops in Japan, oppose war, defend peace and independence, and strive for the stability of the people's lives. As long as the Japanese people's patriotic struggle and the struggle for the people's interests exist, the reactionaries' suppression measures will not stop.

However, the statement further pointed out: The suppression measures have further tempered the JCP and the Japanese people, and made them more consolidated. On the other hand, it has further isolated the traitorous Yoshida government, plunging it into a self-dug grave. The statement said: The JCP's unity is "more consolidated than ever before."

The statement finally put forward the following slogans: Take practical action to oppose the suppression of the Japanese Communist Party! Lift the illegal purges against patriotic people who strive for peace and independence! Release all political prisoners except war criminals! Abolish all suppression laws and decrees! Resolutely oppose the formulation of new suppression laws and national security laws! Guarantee freedom of speech, assembly, and association! Smash the peace treaty for war and the false peace treaty! Immediately conclude a comprehensive peace treaty and promptly withdraw foreign troops! Overthrow the traitorous and reactionary Yoshida Liberal Party government!

    日本共产党本部对策委员会发表声明
    斥吉田政府非法迫害日共领袖
    号召人民保卫独立和政治权利打倒吉田卖国政府
    【新华社十三日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党本部对策委员会在九月八日发表声明，斥责吉田反动政府非法下令逮捕和整肃椎野悦郎等十八位日共领袖。声明说：这次的镇压措施是为了封锁反对单独和约和美日“安全条约”的呼声。反动派企图借镇压日共来破坏日本人民要求和平和独立的意志，镇压日本的人民运动。声明指出：反动派还将继续进行对日共的镇压，并且准备残酷暴虐地镇压反对外国军队永久驻扎日本、反对战争、保卫和平和独立、为谋求人民生活安定而斗争的一切团体和个人。只要日本人民的爱国斗争和谋求人民利益的斗争存在一天，反动派的镇压措施是不会停止的。
    但是，声明进一步指出：镇压措施更加锻炼了日共和日本人民，并且使他们更巩固地团结起来。另一方面，它使卖国的吉田政府更加孤立起来，陷于自掘坟墓的绝境。声明说：日共的团结是“比以前任何时期都巩固了”。
    声明最后提出下列口号：以实际行动反对对于日本共产党的镇压！解除对争取和平和独立的爱国人士的非法整肃处分！释放除去战犯以外的一切政治犯！废止一切镇压法令！坚决反对制订新的镇压法令和国家安全保障法！保障言论、集会、结社的自由！粉碎为了战争的媾和和虚假的媾和！立即缔结全面和约，迅速撤退外国军队！打倒卖国的反动的吉田自由党政府！
