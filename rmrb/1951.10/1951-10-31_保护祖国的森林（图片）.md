Protect the Motherland's Forests
Liu Jiyu
(1) The forests of Northeast China are like an ocean. From Changbai Mountain to the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, there is a lush forest. This is one of our motherland's great natural treasures.

(2) However, this natural resource is often subjected to fires caused by burning mountains for land reclamation and sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, strict protection must be implemented.

(3) If the masses are not stopped from indiscriminate logging, the country's timber resources will also suffer incalculable losses.

    保护祖国的森林
    刘继卣
    （一）我国东北的森林像海洋。从长白山到大小兴安岭，是一片葱郁的森林。这是我们祖国巨大的天然财富之一。
    （二）但是这一天然的富源，常因烧山开荒和反革命分子的破坏，不断造成火灾。因此必须加以严密保护。
    （三）如果不制止群众的滥砍乱伐，也会使国家林木遭受到不可计量的损失。
