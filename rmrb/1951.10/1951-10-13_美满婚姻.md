    Happy Marriage
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Min Ru
    Some people say: The People's Government is good in every way, except the Marriage Law is no good. As soon as the Marriage Law is implemented, family relationships become chaotic. The facts in Flying Village, a suburb of Wuhu City, refute this claim. On the contrary, it proves that the thorough implementation of the Marriage Law not only benefits rural production but also better consolidates family and marital relationships and establishes a new social atmosphere.
    Wang Daomao and Ya Dizi, and Rui Chuanjia and Xiao Lameizi, two newly married couples in Flying Village, were victims of the feudal marriage system in the past and are now living happy and pleasant family lives.
    Wang Daomao's new wife, Ya Dizi, is a twenty-three-year-old working woman who was originally Rui's family's daughter-in-law in this village. She was taken in by the Rui family at the age of four to be raised as a future bride for their son. However, her mother-in-law never gave birth, and later they adopted a nephew from a close relative. When Ya Dizi was nineteen, she was forced to marry. At that time, her husband was only fifteen years old. Speaking of this experience, Ya Dizi felt very sad. She said, "In the month I was taken in, my mother-in-law beat and scolded me more than forty times. Even if I was unhappy, I still had to work for the family like an ox. Even if you were exhausted, they would treat gold as brass, without a single comforting word. If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and the liberation of women, I don't know when this bitter life would end?"
    After the land reform this year, Ya Dizi was allocated 1.5 mu of land and divorced Rui's young husband in accordance with the Marriage Law. Soon after, she married Wang Daomao, a farmer from the same village with whom she had good feelings. Wang Daomao also had a tortuous history. He originally had a child bride named Xiao Lameizi. Since their marriage, they quarreled and fought, and were very unhappy. Wang Daomao was never at home, and his production was perfunctory and unmotivated. Xiao Lameizi, seeing that there was no happiness going on like this, proposed a divorce in June.
    Now he has been married to Ya Dizi for three or four months, and they are living a very happy life. During the busy farming season, the couple work together in the fields, drawing water, weeding, and harvesting. They are both active members of a mutual aid group that has just been organized in the village. Wang Daomao is also the acting leader of the village's land cultivation group. This autumn harvest, Wang Daomao's more than two mu of land, plus the 1.5 mu of land brought by Ya Dizi, yielded more than 1,200 catties of rice, which has now been dried and winnowed and stored in the barn. Since the autumn harvest, Wang Daomao has been helping people in the village with odd jobs every day, without touching a single grain of his own newly harvested rice. Ya Dizi makes straw sandals at home when she has time, earning money for needles, thread, and lamp oil. Now the couple is already planning to raise pigs, chickens, and start a small household business. The villagers all say, "These two have changed, they are really fiery and working hard!"
    Xiao Lameizi, who divorced Wang Daomao, was freely married to Rui Chuanjia, a young farmer in the village, through the introduction of the Farmers' Association director. Rui Chuanjia's original wife was also a child bride, several years older than him. His wife disliked him for being young and had a "lover" outside. The couple had been sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams for more than six years, and had two children. The couple often quarreled, and Rui Chuanjia's production was not energetic, and the family was in a chaotic state. After Rui Chuanjia received publicity and education on the Marriage Law during the land reform, he was the first to propose a divorce. Due to the willingness of both parties, it was satisfactorily resolved after the district government went through the formalities. Each of them raised one child, and each had their own share of land.
    After Rui Chuanjia and Xiao Lameizi voluntarily married, the family atmosphere also changed. Xiao Lameizi said, talking about her past and present situation, "The past things were all the evils of the old society and old rules; now the People's Government and the Marriage Law have broken open my shackles, and I have become a living person from being half-dead!" Rui Chuanjia is now the secretary of the village's Youth League branch and is very active in his work. He said that on the day they got married, they went to the district to register together, received their marriage certificate, and went to the fields to transplant rice seedlings that afternoon. For more than three months now, they haven't quarreled, everyone is happy, and their spirits are much more cheerful.
    In Flying Village, during the land reform this year, because the Marriage Law was repeatedly publicized, the masses' awareness was generally improved. Seven or eight young couples in the village got married and divorced, and two child brides also ended their marriage relationships. Therefore, there were no incidents of female suicide. In the past, as a result of long-term oppression by the feudal marriage system of buying and selling and arranged marriages, some young men and women were forced to find "lovers." Now this phenomenon has been greatly reduced, and there are no more adopted child brides. Many farmers in the village said, "Now that we have been allocated land, life is getting better day by day, and we can make our own decisions about our marriage. Who would want to do that anymore?"
    When Flying Village began to implement the Marriage Law, there were also many obstacles from feudal ideas. Some old men said, "As long as I'm alive, I won't allow anyone to divorce." Some parents-in-law were unwilling for their daughters-in-law to divorce, often quarreling and threatening, "If you divorce, I'll die for you to see." Some village cadres also believed that divorce was okay, but you couldn't marry a "lover." After repeated propaganda and education by the land reform work team, some people's thinking gradually became clear. A Farmers' Association cadre in the village said to the reporter, "I couldn't figure it out before. Divorce and then remarry, won't society be in chaos?! The comrades in the district work team often explained it to me, and I still didn't quite believe it. Now I see that families with freedom of marriage are harmonious, production is active, and the social atmosphere is on the right track. What's wrong with the Marriage Law?"

    美满婚姻
    新华社记者  敏如
    有人说：人民政府什么都好，就是婚姻法不好。婚姻法一实行，家庭关系就乱了。芜湖市郊飞行村的事实，推翻了这种说法。相反地，它证明了贯彻执行了婚姻法，不但有利农村生产，而且更好地巩固了家庭夫妇关系，树立了新的社会风气。
    飞行村的王道毛和押弟子、芮传家和小腊梅子这两对新婚夫妇，过去是封建婚姻制度的牺牲者，现在已过着美满愉快的家庭生活。
    王道毛的新婚妻子押弟子，是一个二十三岁的劳动妇女，原先是本村芮家的媳妇，四岁就被芮家抱来做了等郎媳。可是她婆婆一直没有生育，后来才过继了一个近房侄儿。在押弟子十九岁时，就被迫成了亲。那时她的丈夫还只是十五岁的孩子。谈起这段身世，押弟子心里很难受，她说：“收房的那个月，婆婆就打骂了四十多回。心里不称心，还得像一头牛一样替家里干活。累死了，人家把你黄金当黄铜，没有半句贴心话。要不是毛主席共产党来了，妇女翻了身，这苦日子不知挨到那年那月？”
    押弟子在今年土地改革以后，分了一亩五分田，并遵照婚姻法与芮家的小丈夫离了婚。不久就与原先感情好的本村农民王道毛结了婚。王道毛也有一段曲折史，他原有一个叫小腊梅子的童养媳妻子，结婚以来，吵嘴打架，很不和睦，王道毛就成天不在家，生产也马马虎虎，打不起精神来。小腊梅子眼看这样下去，没有幸福，六月间就提出要离婚。
    现在他与押弟子结婚已三、四个月了，日子过得很美满。农忙时，夫妻俩一道下田车水、耘田、收割。村里刚组织一个互助组，他们都是这个组里的积极的组员。王道毛还当了村的代耕组长。今年秋收，王道毛二亩多田，加上押弟子带来的一亩五分田就打了一千二百多斤稻，现在都已晒干扬净入仓。王道毛从秋收以后，天天帮村里人家打短工，自己收的新稻子一颗也没有动。押弟子在家有空就打草鞋，赚个针线、灯油钱。现在夫妻俩已经盘算着养猪、养鸡、创点小家务了。村里人都说：“这俩口子变了，真是火辣辣，发狠干啦！”
    与王道毛离了婚的小腊梅子，由农会主任介绍与村里的青年农民芮传家自由结婚了。芮传家原先的妻子也是等郎媳，比他大好几岁，他妻子嫌他年纪小，在外面有了“相好”，夫妻结婚六年多，一直同床异梦，却有了两个孩子。夫妻俩常常吵架，芮传家生产也就不带劲，家庭里弄得乌烟瘴气。芮传家在土地改革中受到了婚姻法的宣传教育以后，就第一个提出了离婚的要求，由于双方愿意，经区政府办理手续后就完满地解决了。两个孩子一人抚养一个，而且都有了自己一份土地。
    芮传家与小腊梅子自愿结婚以后，家庭气氛也变了。小腊梅子谈起她过去和现在的情形就说：“过去事都是旧社会旧规矩作的孽；现在人民政府与婚姻法，把我的脚镣手铐砸开了，我像半死人变成了活人啦！”芮传家现在是村里的青年团支部书记，工作很积极。他说：他们结婚那天一道到区里登记，领了结婚证，当天下午就一道下田插秧，到现在三个多月，没有吵过，大家乐意，精神也痛快多了。
    飞行村在今年土地改革时，因为反复宣传了婚姻法，群众觉悟普遍提高，全村有七、八对年轻夫妇结婚和离婚，有两个童养媳也解除了婚姻关系，因此，没有发生过妇女自杀事件。这个村子过去由于长期的买卖包办封建婚姻制度压迫的结果，有些青年男女被迫地去找“相好”。现在这种现象已经大大减少了，抱童养媳的也没有了。村里很多农民说：“现在分了田，日子一天好过一天，自己的亲事自己作主，谁还愿意那样作呢？”
    飞行村在开始贯彻婚姻法的时候，也有许多封建思想的阻碍。有的老头子说：“有我在一天，就不准谁离婚。”有的公婆不愿儿媳离婚，常常吵吵闹闹，还威胁着说：“你离，我就死给你看。”也有些村干部认为离婚可以，但不能跟“相好”的结婚。经过土地改革工作组反复宣传教育，有些人思想才逐步搞通了。该村的一个农会干部对记者说：“以前我也弄不通，离婚又结婚，社会不要搞乱了？！区里工作组的同志常常解释给我听，我还有些不相信。现在看，婚姻自由的家庭和睦了，生产积极了，社会风气正道了，婚姻法还有那条不好呢？”
