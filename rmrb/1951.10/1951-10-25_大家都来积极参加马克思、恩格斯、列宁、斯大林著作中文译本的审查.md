    Everyone Actively Participate in the Review of Chinese Translations of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin

    Recently, the Central People's Government Publishing Administration widely solicited opinions from relevant academic organizations regarding all Chinese translations of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, in order to revise and re-translate them in the future. This matter is worthy of attention.

    The widespread dissemination of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in China has largely been achieved through Chinese translations. However, during the years of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule and the People's Revolutionary War, translating the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin was a dangerous and difficult task. Many people engaged in translation in environments pursued by secret agents, in the deep mountains of guerrilla areas, lacking reference books, and sometimes limited by insufficient theoretical level and language training. Under such circumstances, it was impossible for the translations to be flawless. Therefore, today, we should not blame this group of translators for not providing us with perfect translations, but should affirm their achievements in spreading Marxism-Leninism.

    However, today's conditions are completely different. We should re-examine all Chinese translations of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in order to further strive for perfect translations. This review can be actively participated in by relevant academic organizations, translators, and readers who are proficient in the original languages. On the other hand, past translators can also conduct "self-examination." The results of these two types of inspections are best published in newspapers and magazines, so as to gather wisdom and solve all difficult problems. We hope that more people will participate in this review work and do a good job in revising and re-translating the Chinese translations of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

### 大家都来积极参加马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作中文译本的审查

    大家都来积极参加马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作中文译本的审查
    最近中央人民政府出版总署曾向有关学术团体广泛征集对于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作所有中文译本的意见，以便将来进行修改和重译工作。这件事情是值得重视的。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作在中国的广泛传播，很大一部分是通过中文译本来进行的。而在过去国民党反动派统治和人民革命战争的岁月里，翻译马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，却是一种危险和艰难的工作。不少人就在特务追逐的环境里，在游击区的深山里从事翻译，工具书也很缺乏，有时往往还受理论水平和语言训练等条件不足的限制。在这种情况下，要想译本毫无瑕疵是不可能的。因此，在今天，我们对于这一批翻译工作者不但不因为他们没有供给我们尽善尽美的译本而加以责备，而且还应当肯定他们传播马克思列宁主义的业绩。
    但是今天的条件完全不同了，我们应该把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的一切中文译本重新审查一下，以便进一步求得十分完美的译本。这种审查，一方面可由各有关学术团体、翻译工作者以及通晓原文的读者积极参加审查，另一方面也可以由过去的译者进行“自我检查”。这两种检查的结果，最好能在报章杂志公开发表，以便集思广益，解决一切疑难问题。我们希望有更多人来参加这审查工作，把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作的中文译本的修改和重译工作做好。
