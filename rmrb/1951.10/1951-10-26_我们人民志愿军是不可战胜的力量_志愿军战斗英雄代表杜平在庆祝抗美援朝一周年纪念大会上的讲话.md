    Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army is an Invincible Force
    — Speech by Du Ping, Representative of Combat Heroes of the Volunteer Army, at the Commemoration Meeting for the First Anniversary of Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    Today, we commemorate the first anniversary of the War to Resist America and Aid Korea and Defend Our Homes and Motherland with full confidence in victory.
    In this year of anti-aggression warfare, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army bravely fought, inflicting heavy blows on the American-led invading forces. Because all of our Volunteer Army comrades know that every victory we achieve on the front lines has a significant impact on the security of our motherland and peace in the Far East, every comrade has a high sense of responsibility, fights bravely and resolutely, and is unafraid of sacrifice, and thus has achieved great victories. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, we have annihilated more than 387,000 invading enemy troops, destroyed or damaged 2,300 enemy aircraft, consumed a large amount of enemy supplies and equipment, driven the enemy back from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, and shattered the enemy's arrogant plan to quickly occupy Korea and attack the Chinese mainland, leaving the enemy trapped in a protracted war of attrition, facing a failed outcome. This victory laid the foundation for the inevitable final victory of the Chinese and Korean people, and defended the security of our motherland and peace in the Far East.
    In the struggle to achieve this great victory, many of our comrades were gloriously wounded or fell ill, and I express my sincere condolences to them. Many of our comrades also heroically gave their lives, and I express my highest respect and mourning to the martyrs. The martyrs who gloriously sacrificed in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea are immortal!
    In this year of anti-aggression warfare, the people of the whole country, regardless of class, belief, party affiliation, gender, or age, have taken Resisting America and Aiding Korea and Defending Our Homes and Motherland as their common goal, actively donating airplanes and cannons, and enthusiastically supporting the Volunteer Army, which has provided a significant guarantee for the victory on the front lines. We thank the China Peace Committee, and we thank the support of the people of the motherland. We are very excited about the unprecedented unity of the people of the whole country, which proves that the Chinese people who have stood up cannot be bullied and that American imperialism can be defeated. After a year of war, our strength has become stronger and stronger, our combat experience has become richer, and our equipment has also been greatly improved. We have not only learned the most effective way to strike the enemy, but also quickly learned to master new technologies. Our commanders, political workers, and logistics workers have all improved their command and organizational skills. This strength has already been demonstrated and has already caused the enemy to suffer heavier blows than in the past. However, we are not complacent about this. We know that the Korean armistice negotiations may fail due to the sabotage of American imperialism, and American imperialism is still actively arming Japan, attempting to expand its aggression. Therefore, we must be a hundred times more vigilant and step up preparations to strike enemies who dare to risk attacking north.
    Comrades, our Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has said: Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army is an invincible force, and we have many superior conditions that the enemy will never obtain. Now all our forces are developing, and the people of the motherland are supporting us more effectively. We will make full use of this force to strike the enemy. We believe that victory must belong to us.
    Today, as we commemorate the first anniversary of our departure to fight abroad, let me shout:
    Long live the fighting brotherhood between the Chinese and Korean people!
    Long live the Korean People's Army!
    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Long live General Kim Il-sung!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    我们人民志愿军是不可战胜的力量
    ——志愿军战斗英雄代表杜平在庆祝抗美援朝一周年纪念大会上的讲话
    我们今天满怀着胜利的信心来纪念抗美援朝保家卫国战争的一周年。
    在这一年的反侵略战争中，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军英勇作战的结果给美帝国主义为首的侵略军的打击是很沉重的。因为我们志愿军全体同志都知道我们在前线上的每个胜利，都对祖国的安全和远东的和平有着重大的影响，因而每个同志都有高度的责任感，作起战来都是勇敢坚决，奋不顾身，也因而获得了巨大的胜利。一年来的战绩，据不完全统计，共歼灭了侵略军三十八万七千人之多，击毁击伤敌人的飞机二千三百架，大量地消耗了敌人的物资和装备，把敌人从鸭绿江边赶回到三八线附近，粉碎了敌人企图迅速占领朝鲜、进攻中国大陆的狂妄计划，使敌人陷在长期的消耗战中，面临着失败的结局。这一胜利奠定了中朝人民必然获得最后胜利的基础，保卫了我们祖国的安全和远东的和平。
    在获得这伟大胜利的斗争中，我们有许多同志光荣的负了伤、生了病，我向他们表示诚挚的慰问；我们也有许多同志英勇的贡献出他们的生命，我向烈士们表示崇高敬意和哀悼。在抗美援朝战争中，光荣牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    在这一年的反侵略战争中，全国人民不分阶层、不分信仰、不分党派、不分男女老少，都以抗美援朝保家卫国为共同行动的目标，积极捐献飞机大炮，热烈支援志愿军，使前线的胜利获得了重大的保证。我们感谢抗美援朝总会，我们感谢祖国人民的支援。我们对全国人民所表现的空前团结的力量，表示非常兴奋，证明了站起来的中国人民是不可欺负的，证明了美帝国主义是可以打败的。经过一年来战争的锻炼，我们的力量是越战越强了，作战的经验更加丰富了，我们的装备也有了很大的改善，我们不仅已经学会了用最有效的办法打击敌人，而且很快地学会了掌握新的技术。我们的指挥员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员都提高了自己的指挥和组织的才能，这种力量已经显示出来，并已经使敌人遭到比过去更沉重的打击。但是，我们并不以此自满，我们知道：朝鲜的停战谈判还有因美帝国主义的破坏而失败的可能，美帝国主义还在积极武装日本，企图扩大侵略，因此，我们必须百倍警惕，加紧准备打击胆敢冒险北犯的敌人。
    同志们，我们中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员讲过：我们中国人民志愿军是不可战胜的力量，我们有许多优越的条件是敌人永远得不到的。现在我们一切力量正在发展，祖国人民正在更有效地支援我们，我们将充分运用这种力量来打击敌人。我们相信，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    在此纪念我们出国作战一周年的今天，让我高呼：
    中朝人民战斗的兄弟友谊万岁！
    朝鲜人民军万岁！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    金日成将军万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
