    Since the democratic parties jointly issued a declaration on November 4th last year, resolutely expressing their support for the national people in resisting America and aiding Korea, over the past year, members of the democratic parties have enthusiastically participated in the vigorous movement to resist America and aid Korea, tirelessly working to support the Chinese People's Volunteers in striking against the American aggressors.
    This spring, members of the democratic parties actively participated in mass movements to support the conclusion of a world peace pact and oppose the American rearmament of Japan. The local organizations of the China Democratic League mobilized 330,000 people to sign in support of the conclusion of a world peace pact and conducted voting against the American rearmament of Japan. The local branches of the China Association for Promoting Democracy universally mobilized members to carry out publicity in schools, factories, shops, and residences, mobilizing a total of more than 110,000 people to vote and sign. Since the end of November last year, the China National Democratic Construction Association has organized and promoted patriotic demonstrations and parades by industrial and commercial circles in 21 cities including Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Beijing, Harbin, and Xi'an. In the mass movements to resist America and aid Korea and to oppose America's support of Japan, members of the democratic parties and the masses they are connected with have greatly improved their political understanding and laid the foundation for further developing the work of resisting America and aiding Korea.
    When the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued the call on June 1st this year to donate airplanes and artillery to support the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting on the Korean front, members of the democratic parties enthusiastically responded to this call and actively donated funds. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the China Association for Promoting Democracy have all established donation movement committees to actively carry out donation work. As of the 15th of this month, members of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and 17 local organizations such as Shanghai and Tianjin have pledged more than 1.9 billion yuan. Members of the Democratic League at all levels have paid donations exceeding the amount for a "Democratic League" fighter plane. Members of the China National Democratic Construction Association played a significant role in promoting the donation movement of industrial and commercial circles in various places, and some members even individually pledged a fighter plane. The North China General Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League has paid more than half of the total amount pledged. Overseas members of the China Zhi Gong Party have also actively donated, sending their donations back to the motherland to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    The democratic party organizations carried out large-scale propaganda work to resist America and aid Korea, so that members of the democratic parties and the masses they are connected with received one to several patriotic education sessions. According to incomplete statistics, the Democratic League at all levels has held more than 400 forums and more than 350 lectures and reports over the past year to publicize the resistance against America and aid to Korea. Local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Fujian, Guangxi, Hubei and other places used blackboard newspapers, pictorials, and clappers to carry out publicity, which was warmly welcomed by the local people. The local organizations of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held patriotic lectures once a week, with audiences ranging from 500 to 600 people each time. The Jiusan Society regularly organizes people from cultural and educational circles to hold forums on anti-American aggression and eradicating American imperialist cultural forces. In addition to regularly holding current affairs forums, the local branches of the China Association for Promoting Democracy also held key accusation meetings to accuse the crimes of American imperialism. The Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy also published many pamphlets and publicity materials centered on resisting America and aiding Korea. Through current affairs publicity and patriotic education, the democratic party organizations not only greatly improved the political level of members of their respective parties, but also educated the broad masses of the people.
    Members of the democratic parties care for and love the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting to defend the motherland. They wrote many letters of condolence and donated a lot of condolence money to comfort the soldiers of the Volunteers. According to incomplete statistics from 17 local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Shanghai, Beijing, etc., more than 4,000 letters of condolence and more than 70 million yuan of condolence money were sent. The China Association for Promoting Democracy collected more than 12,000 letters of condolence and more than 1,000 pieces of clothing, books, newspapers, and daily necessities from members across the country and forwarded them to the Korean front. This spring, the democratic parties also sent representatives to participate in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to conduct condolences on the Korean front.
    The local organizations of the democratic parties have generally paid attention to the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers. This year, during the Spring Festival, the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang cooperated with the local First District People's Government to hold an evening party to entertain more than 1,000 households of martyrs' families and soldiers' families; in addition, it organized condolence teams to go to the countryside to comfort the martyrs' families and soldiers' families living in the countryside. The Jiusan Society once mobilized its members to send pennants to the families of meritorious soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. In order to do a good job in preferential treatment, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party specially organized a preferential treatment work committee and absorbed activists from the people to participate, making the preferential treatment work a mass work.
    Over the past year, members of the democratic parties have actively participated in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and promoted the work of resisting America and aiding Korea; at the same time, members of the democratic parties have also gained great experience in their work and improved their political understanding. The mass base of the democratic parties has also expanded, and the organizations have been consolidated and developed in the movement. For example, the membership of the China Association for Promoting Democracy has increased by 70 percent in the year of the movement to resist America and aid Korea. On the existing basis, the democratic party organizations will further exert greater strength in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea.

    一年来各民主党派的抗美援朝工作
    去年十一月四日各民主党派发表联合宣言，坚决表示支援全国人民抗美援朝以后，一年来，各民主党派成员热烈地参加了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，为支援中国人民志愿军打击美国侵略者而不倦地进行着工作。
    今年春天，各民主党派成员积极地参加了拥护缔结世界和平公约和反对美国武装日本的群众性的运动。中国民主同盟各地方组织曾发动了三十三万人在拥护缔结世界和平公约上签名，并进行了反对美国武装日本的投票。中国民主促进会各地分会普遍动员会员到学校、工厂、商店、住户进行宣传，总共发动了十一万多人进行了投票和签名。民主建国会自去年十一月底起即组织和推动天津、上海、重庆、北京、哈尔滨、西安等二十一个城市的工商界举行爱国示威大游行。各民主党派成员及其所联系的群众在抗美援朝、反美扶日的群众运动中，大大地提高了自己的政治认识，打下了进一步展开抗美援朝工作的基础。
    当中国人民抗美援朝总会在今年六月一日发出捐献飞机大炮支援在朝鲜前线作战的中国人民志愿军的号召以后，各民主党派的成员热烈地响应了这个号召，踊跃捐献款项。中国国民党革命委员会、民主建国会、中国民主促进会等都建立了捐献运动委员会，积极进行捐献工作。中国国民党革命委员会中央和上海、天津等十七个地方组织成员截至本月十五日止，已认捐十九亿余元。民主同盟各级组织的盟员缴纳献款已超过“民盟号”战斗机一架的款数。民主建国会会员在推动各地工商界进行捐献的运动中，起了不小作用，有的会员还单独认捐战斗机一架。台湾民主自治同盟华北总支部已缴献款占认捐总数的一半以上。中国致公党海外党员也纷纷进行捐献，将献款寄回祖国，支援中国人民志愿军。
    各民主党派组织进行了较大规模的抗美援朝宣传工作，使得各民主党派的成员以及他们所联系的群众受了一次至数次的爱国主义教育。据不完全统计，民主同盟各级组织一年来共举行了四百多次座谈会和三百五十多次演讲会、报告会，宣传抗美援朝。中国国民党革命委员会福建、广西、湖北等地方组织都利用黑板报、画报、快板等方式进行宣传，受到当地人民群众的热烈欢迎。中国农工民主党各地方组织举办了爱国主义讲座，每星期日举行一次，每次听众有多至五、六百人的。九三学社经常组织文化、教育界人士举行反美侵略、肃清美帝国主义文化势力等座谈会。中国民主促进会各地分会除经常召开时事座谈会外，还有重点地举行了控诉会，控诉美帝国主义的罪行。民主同盟和民主促进会还出版了不少以抗美援朝为中心内容的小册子和宣传资料。各民主党派组织通过时事宣传和爱国主义教育，不仅大大提高了各该党派成员的政治水平，并且教育了广大人民群众。
    各民主党派成员关心和热爱为保卫祖国而战斗的中国人民志愿军。他们写了不少慰问信和献出了不少慰问金，慰劳志愿军将士。据中国国民党革命委员会上海、北京等十七个地方组织的不完全统计，共发出慰劳信四千多封，慰问金七千余万元。中国民主促进会共汇集了各地会员的慰问信一万二千余封和衣服、书报、日用品等一千余件转送朝鲜前线。今年春天，各民主党派还推派了代表，参加中国人民赴朝慰问团，亲赴朝鲜前线进行慰问。
    各民主党派地方组织都普遍注意了优待革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的工作。中国国民党革命委员会北京市分部在今年春节曾配合当地第一区人民政府举行了晚会，招待烈士家属和军人家属一千余户；另外还组织了慰劳队下乡慰问住在农村里的烈士家属和军人家属。九三学社曾经发动社员向中国人民志愿军立功战士家属致送锦旗。中国农工民主党为了要做好优抚工作，特组织了优抚工作委员会，并吸收人民群众中的积极分子参加，使优抚工作成为群众性的工作。
    一年来，各民主党派成员积极地参加了抗美援朝运动，推动了抗美援朝工作；同时各民主党派成员，在工作中也获得了很大的锻炼，提高了自己的政治认识。各民主党派的群众基础也扩大了，在运动中巩固和发展了组织，如中国民主促进会的会员在抗美援朝运动一年来发展了百分之七十。各民主党派组织在现有的基础上，将更进一步地对抗美援朝工作发挥更大的力量。（新华社）
