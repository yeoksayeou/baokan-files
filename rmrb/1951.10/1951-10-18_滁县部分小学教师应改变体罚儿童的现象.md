To the Editor:

    Chuxian has been liberated for more than two years, but many school teachers still use old methods to manage students. Some believe that if they don't beat the students, the students won't be afraid, and they won't be able to manage the students well. In the first half of this year, Hu Jinshan, a teacher at Yangfendian Primary School in Zhulong District, beat six students in a row on one occasion. Incidents of punishing students to stand in the hot sun have occurred in the Sanlipu and Yangyingzi schools in the urban area. Sun Deren, a teacher at Shahe District Peasant Primary School, told students to beat each other. Corporal punishments such as flicking noses and twisting ears are also common. There are also disguised forms of corporal punishment, such as teachers at Wuyi Primary School punishing students by copying books. Teachers at Xiguan Primary School in the urban area helped the student union to formulate a covenant, stipulating that the first violation would be punished by standing for 30 minutes, the second by flicking the nose 30 times, and the third by being beaten with a board.

    Corporal punishment is harmful to the physical and mental development of children. The Chuxian People's Government has issued instructions repeatedly, prohibiting corporal punishment, but corporal punishment continues to occur in primary schools in Chuxian. This is because some teachers still have old ideas and have not seriously studied the new democratic education policy. We hope that teachers in Chuxian should conduct a comprehensive review of their thinking and work, and establish new educational viewpoints. The county people's government should also take effective measures to eliminate the phenomenon of corporal punishment.

    滁县部分小学教师应改变体罚儿童的现象编辑同志：
    滁县解放已经两年多了，但很多学校的教师仍用旧的方法来管理学生，有的认为不打学生，学生不怕，就不能管好学生。今年上半年珠龙区杨饭店小学教师胡金珊，有一次一连打了六个学生；城区三里铺和扬郢子两校发生过罚学生站在烈日下的事件；沙河区农民小学教师孙德仁叫学生互相殴打。刮鼻子、扭耳朵的体罚也很普遍。还有变相的体罚，如乌衣小学教师罚学生抄书。城区西关小学教师帮学生会订立了公约，第一次违犯者罚站三十分钟，第二次刮鼻子三十次，第三次罚打板子。
    体罚对儿童的身心发育是有害的。滁县人民政府曾经三番五次发出指示，禁止体罚，但是滁县的小学校仍不断发生体罚的事情，这是由于一部分教师还存在着旧的意识，没有认真学习新民主主义的教育政策的原故。我们希望滁县的教师应从思想上工作上进行全面的检查，树立新的教育观点。县人民政府方面也应该采取有效的措施，以消灭体罚的现象。皖北滁县人民政府  陈钧  放野
