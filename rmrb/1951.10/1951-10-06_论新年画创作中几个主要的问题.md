    On Several Major Issues in New Year Picture Creation
    Cai Ruohong
    I. Achievements and Current Shortcomings in New Year Picture Creation

    In the past two years, the publication of New Year pictures has greatly developed nationwide. Last year (1950), 26 regions across the country published New Year pictures, with a total of more than 400 types of creations; this year, 31 regions have published New Year pictures, with a total of more than 580 types of creations; last year, the total number of copies issued in various regions of the country was more than 7 million, and this year's total issuance is more than 15 million, more than double that of last year.

    In terms of New Year picture creation, there has also been significant progress in the past two years. More and more art workers are participating in the creation, and some relatively excellent works are produced every year. In this year's works, for example, Lin Gang's "Zhao Guilan at the Heroes' Meeting," Deng Shu's "Signing Campaign to Defend Peace," Gu Yuan's "Chairman Mao Talking with Peasants," Li Qi and Feng Zhen's collaboration "The Great Meeting," Gu Yizhou's "Each Showing Their Ability," Wu Biduan's "Defending the Motherland's Border," A Lao's "Korean People Welcoming the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," Miao Di's "Hero's Triumphant Return," Ji Guisen's "Eliminating Harm for the People," Ding Yu's "Female Tractor Driver," Zhang Huaixin's "New Agricultural Implement Experiment," and Xu Bangqia and Xiao Caizhou's "Twelve Months in the Countryside," etc., all represent the revolutionary struggle and the faces of heroes of the Chinese people from various aspects, depicting the fresh things and magnificent prospects in the construction of the new society; especially in the work "Zhao Guilan at the Heroes' Meeting," the author not only appropriately expressed the lofty feelings of the meeting between the hero of New China and the people's leader, but also fully promoted the excellent style of the national tradition in the form of expression, providing a good example for New Year picture creation. In addition, Zhang Biwu's "The Army Helps the People, the People Help the Army" and Yang Junsheng's "Thank Chairman Mao for Receiving Land Certificates" also used the original style of calendar posters in their form of expression, but the themes were completely changed to new life content; this creative method has opened up a correct path for the transformation of calendar posters, and people have reason to welcome such New Year pictures.

    However, there are still many shortcomings in New Year picture works, and some shortcomings are relatively common, which can be roughly summarized into two categories:

    The first type of shortcoming is that the combination of New Year picture content and real-life content is not enough, especially the combination with the actual situation of the region is not enough; the authors' grasp of the subject matter is not from actual life but from concepts, so the content of the works is often superficial, weak, and formulaic, lacking ideological content, and even errors occur in the image. For example, there are such examples: some areas cannot grow cotton, but they made New Year pictures about how to grow cotton, and as a result, no one bought these New Year pictures. Some works praise rural labor heroes, but they do not show the specific characters and heroic deeds on the screen, so the farmers who watch the New Year pictures say: "Why don't you paint our real affairs!" There are also many works that depict production and construction, painting factories, painting the countryside, painting bridge repairs and road repairs, painting land reclamation... These are all very good themes, but the authors only seize some superficial phenomena, and do not focus on showing the characteristics of production and construction, do not focus on showing the working people's attitude as masters in production and construction, and do not focus on showing the combination of productive labor and patriotism; therefore, from the screen, you cannot see the fundamental difference between the production labor of the new society and the past situation. There are also many authors who produce a large number of "children's plays," putting all serious struggles into children's games, which also shows that the authors are divorced from the real struggle, and therefore lack the ability to describe the struggle positively. In terms of character image, some authors depict the customs and characters of northern Shaanxi in New Year pictures distributed in Jiangnan, some authors forcibly pull northern mules and horses and southern water buffalo together for farming, some works still distort the image of the people's leaders, and some authors continue to unconsciously uglify the image of the working people... Of course, the main reasons for these shortcomings are that the authors are divorced from real life, that the authors lack ideological training and technical cultivation, and at the same time, that the authors still lack a serious and responsible attitude towards New Year picture creation.

    Another shortcoming is that New Year picture creation is gradually deviating from the excellent traditions of folk New Year pictures, and ignoring the positive factors of the connection between folk New Year pictures and the broad masses of people. For example, in terms of content, folk New Year pictures often reflect people's ideals for life, their pursuit of happiness, their remembrance of beautiful characters, and their love for the motherland's mountains and rivers; what is expressed through New Year pictures is those themes such as peace, auspiciousness, multiple children, and longevity, and those types of paintings such as figures, landscapes, historical stories, and folk legends. These themes and types of paintings are not impossible to use today, and can be completely linked to today's new life content, and can be completely combined with ideological education such as love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, and love for science, but such works are rarely seen in New Year pictures. In terms of form, the four-panel screens, lunar calendars, monthly cards, and story pictures in folk New Year pictures have always been loved by the Chinese people and are suitable for the appreciation habits of the broad masses of people, but the use of this form in New Year picture works is also gradually decreasing; replacing them are some monotonous Western-style picture forms, and even oil paintings and pen drawings with Western styles that are not suitable for the form of New Year pictures have appeared in the expression methods; this phenomenon of neglecting and deviating from the tradition of folk New Year pictures should be corrected in future New Year picture creation.

    II. Strengthening the Leadership of New Year Picture Creation is
    an Important Key to Improving the Quality of New Year Pictures

    The shortcomings reflected in New Year picture works, in the final analysis, are also the shortcomings in the leadership of creation work.

    New Year picture creation is an important aspect of art popularization work, and it already occupies a fixed position in the cultural life of the Chinese people; what it expresses this year and what it expresses next year are not only directly related to the political, economic, and cultural life of the broad masses of people, but also closely related to the current political propaganda and ideological education; therefore, the creative content of New Year pictures is directly related to all aspects of social life, and many practical problems related to creation cannot be completely solved by the creator alone, but require an organized and planned leadership to help them solve.

    In terms of the current situation of New Year picture creation, it is undeniable that it is still in an unorganized and unplanned state; the work of drawing New Year pictures is basically still a personal handicraft method; the author can only create according to his own subjective wishes, not according to objective actual needs; the creation plan is formulated according to individuals or small work units, not uniformly formulated according to the specific situation of the region; the creative materials are very incomplete materials collected by individuals (one-sided phenomena), not materials organized and sorted out by various administrative work departments. In addition, since the national liberation, many art workers with creative experience have taken on work other than creation, giving up creation or treating New Year picture creation as a temporary task; and new art workers, who lack understanding of real life and do not study politics regularly, have many authors who regard New Year picture creation as an annual old-fashioned article; in terms of personal creative conditions and ideological preparation, it is also very insufficient. Under such creative circumstances, the content of New Year picture works cannot but deviate from reality, it is difficult to contain realistic educational significance, and it is bound to be out of touch with the requirements of the broad masses of people.

    A social art activity, but without using social forces to ensure its correct completion, the key to the problem lies here.

    So it must be attributed to the leadership problem of creation, and first of all, it is the organizational leadership problem of creation, because only by using the collective method of society to help the author create in an organized manner can the phenomenon of aimless and unplanned blind creation be eliminated, and can the improvement of the quality of the work be guaranteed. According to the current general situation, the leadership method of New Year picture creation is still limited to mobilizing creation, drafting creation outlines, and reviewing drafts, and the creation outlines are often empty articles lacking specific content. This kind of outline not only cannot solve the author's specific problems in creation, but also promotes the tendency of formalism in creation. As for the review of drafts, it can only have an effect on rectifying the publishing work, but cannot play a positive role in guiding creation and improving the quality of creation. This creative leadership method must be changed, and it must be strengthened in response to the shortcomings in the current creative method, determine the principles of creation and the specific steps of the work, the focus of which includes the following aspects:

    (1) It should be affirmed that the importance of combining New Year picture creation with the actual situation must be based on the actual situation and needs of the region's political, economic, and cultural development, and based on the heroic model deeds in production and construction and the fresh things emerging in the people's lives to formulate a unified creation plan. This creation plan should not only have specific content, but also cooperate with the collection of creative materials related to the plan, so that the author can grasp the materials before creating. The cultural and educational departments that lead the creation of New Year pictures should regard specific work such as formulating plans and collecting materials as an important part of leading creation.

    (2) The distribution of creative materials and the implementation of creative plans must be discussed in depth in art work units, so that authors have sufficient preparation in creative thinking. When necessary, authors should be helped to live in the countryside or factories so that they can correctly understand and express life.

    (3) It should be affirmed that the importance of combining creative practice with creative learning must organize new and old authors to jointly study creation and study policies, hold discussions and preliminary draft observation meetings, so that old writers can guide new writers, so that creative experience can be exchanged with each other, and so that the shortcomings of works can be corrected in time. Art groups that lead the creation of New Year pictures should regard this kind of learning organization work as an indispensable part of leading creation.

    (4) The phenomenon of being out of touch with the masses, which only cares about creation and does not ask about the effect, must be eradicated. Art work groups should widely solicit opinions from the masses on New Year picture works, and sort out and study these opinions as an important basis for improving and improving New Year picture creation.

    III. Transforming Folk New Year Pictures Cannot Be Separated from the Tradition of Folk New Year Pictures

    New Year pictures are developed on the basis of folk New Year pictures. Making New Year pictures and transforming folk New Year pictures are two aspects of one job. Making New Year pictures must inherit the excellent traditions of folk New Year pictures, so as not to be out of touch with the requirements of the masses; transforming folk New Year pictures must conform to the development direction of New Year pictures, so as not to be out of touch with the people's lives; the two are interrelated and cannot be arbitrarily divided.

    But at present, both in terms of production and publication, there is a state of mutual irrelevance between New Year pictures and folk New Year pictures; New Year picture makers ignore the existence of folk New Year pictures and do not pay attention to the transformation of folk New Year pictures. Folk New Year pictures are published as they are, or arbitrarily transformed (such as adding the absurd slogan "Break class concepts and pursue maidservant spouses" on the screen of "San Xiao Yin Yuan"), forming a chaotic situation in the publication of New Year pictures.

    Now is the time to end this situation, and the transformation of folk New Year pictures should be put on the work agenda of art workers. Here we must touch on two major issues: one is the issue of the transformation policy, and the other is the issue of the transformation method.

    So, what is the transformation policy of folk New Year pictures?

    There has been such a argument that folk New Year pictures are a product of feudal society, so the content of folk New Year pictures is all feudal, superstitious, and other backward consciousness, which should be completely eliminated; even protests have been raised against the expression techniques of folk artists and calendar poster painters, which has had a very bad impact on folk New Year picture artists. Of course, folk New Year pictures do contain many feudal superstitions and pornographic ugliness, otherwise there is no need for transformation. But feudalism is only one side of the content of folk New Year pictures, and there is also a democratic side. If there is no democratic side, folk New Year pictures cannot still be popular today. Therefore, the guiding principle of transforming folk New Year pictures is to "eliminate its feudal dross and absorb its democratic essence" as Chairman Mao said, that is, to distinguish between the feudal and democratic nature in folk New Year pictures, and to distinguish between the content and form of folk New Year pictures. All that is beneficial to the people and loved by the people should be retained; all that is harmful to the people, even if the people do not know its harm, should be reformed. It is wrong to take a completely negative attitude towards content and form.

    So, what is the method of transforming folk New Year pictures?

    There has been such a method, asking folk artists to give up their profession and all change to draw themes of real struggle, which puts folk artists in a difficult position. Because some folk artists specialize in painting landscapes, some specialize in painting beauties, and some specialize in painting birds and flowers. Special technology cannot be changed immediately, so what should be done? There are only two ways out: one is to temporarily not transform and continue to paint the content that he originally knew how to paint; the other is to really express the themes of real struggle, but as a result, wrong content and wrong images are expressed; facts have proved that hasty methods will not work.

    This illustrates a problem: the transformation of folk New Year pictures and the transformation of folk artists are equally inseparable from the original tradition. The method of transformation is, on the one hand, to inherit the original excellent tradition, and on the other hand, to transform the old tradition on the basis of the new content. Since there are themes and types of paintings in folk New Year pictures that can be affirmed, folk artists certainly have the ability to express these types of themes and paintings; therefore, landscape paintings are not impossible to transform, as long as they express the beautiful mountains and rivers of our motherland, why can't they be combined with patriotism; beauty paintings are not impossible to transform, as long as they are paintings of working people's beauties, why can't they be combined with the concept of productive labor; birds, feathers, flowers and fruits are not impossible to paint, if you cooperate with the promotion of local products, you can still play a certain role; fat babies are not impossible to paint, if you cooperate with the promotion of maternal and child hygiene, you can still get the effect of educating the people; other such as historical stories, folk tales, and local operas can also be painted, as long as you can promote the diligence, bravery, patriotism, and healthy thinking of the Chinese people from these themes... In this way, we have opened up a broad road for the transformation of folk New Year pictures, which is not only a road combined with real life and revolutionary struggle, but also a road that folk artists can take.

    Because of this, the central issue of transforming folk New Year pictures is to organize folk New Year picture artists to study and give them specific guidance.

    It should be affirmed that folk New Year picture artists (including calendar poster painters) have rich creative experience, they are familiar with the people's artistic preferences, and are proficient in the production methods of New Year pictures. As long as they are helped to conduct a certain period of political study and business study, they can completely shoulder the task of transforming folk New Year pictures. But here is an important process, that is, in creative practice, new art workers must cooperate with them, this cooperation is not empty verbal preaching, but practical and patient specific help; not only give them topics to write articles, but also plan specific creative content for them, provide them with necessary reference materials, so that they have confidence at the beginning of creation, and can happily be competent. In this cooperation, new art workers should not interfere with their original technology, do not change their brush into a pen, do not change their woodcut into lithography, but should actively help them improve their expression methods and help them process their production technology. Moreover, new art workers can also learn their technical strengths and learn the principles of their technology in contacting the masses; only under such cooperative circumstances can the transformation of folk New Year pictures be carried out smoothly and completed successfully. New and old art workers should regard this cooperation as the glorious task of reforming the old cultural undertakings of society.

    论新年画创作中几个主要的问题
    蔡若虹
    一、新年画创作的成绩和目前所存在的缺点
    两年以来，新年画的出版工作在全国范围内有极大的发展，去年（一九五○年）全国有二十六个地区出版了新年画，创作种数共四百余种；今年则有三十一个地区出版了新年画，创作种数共五百八十余种；去年全国各地区的发行总数是七百余万份，今年的发行总数是一千五百余万份；比去年增加了一倍多。
    在新年画的创作工作方面，两年来也有了显著的进步，参加创作的美术工作者逐渐加多了，每年都产生了一些比较优秀的作品。在今年的作品里面，比如林岗的“群英会上的赵桂兰”，邓澍的“保卫和平的签名运动”，古元的“毛主席和农民谈话”，李琦、冯真合作的“伟大的会见”，古一舟的“各显其能”，伍必端的“保卫祖国的边疆”，阿劳的 “朝鲜人民欢迎中国人民志愿军”，苗地的“英雄荣归”，计桂森的“为民除害”，丁鱼的“女拖拉机手”，张怀信的“新农具试验”以及徐邦洽、萧采洲的“农村十二个月”等等，都从各个不同的方面表现了中国人民的革命斗争和英雄们的面貌，描绘了新社会建设中的新鲜事物和壮丽远景；特别是在“英雄会上的赵桂兰”这幅作品中，作者不但恰当地表达了新中国的英雄和人民领袖会见时的崇高的感情，而且在表现形式上也充分发扬了民族传统中的优良风格，给新年画创作提供了一个很好的范例。此外，还有张碧梧的“军帮民、民帮军”和杨俊生的“领得土地证感谢毛主席”两幅作品，也都在表现形式上运用了月份牌画片的原有风格，题材上却完全改换了新的生活内容；这种创作方法在月份牌画片的改造工作上开辟了一条正确的道路，人们有理由欢迎这样的新年画。
    但在新年画作品中，也还存在着不少的缺点，有些缺点是比较普遍的，大致可以归纳为这样两类：
    第一类的缺点，是新年画内容与现实生活内容的结合不够，尤其是与地区的实际情况的结合不够；作者的掌握题材，不是从实际生活出发而是从概念出发，因而作品内容就往往流于空泛、贫弱和公式化，缺乏思想内容，甚至在形象上也发生了错误。比如有这样的例子：有的地区不能种植棉花，可是却制作了如何种植棉花的年画，结果是无人来买这种年画。有的作品在歌颂农村的劳动英雄，可是没有把具体人物和英雄事迹在画面上表现出来，所以看年画的农民说：“为啥不画画咱们的实事呀！”还有不少的作品在描写生产建设，画工厂，画农村，画修桥、补路，画开荒垦地……这都是一些很好的题材，但是作者们只攫取了一些表面现象，没有着重表现生产建设中的特点，没有着重表现劳动人民在生产建设中的主人翁态度，没有着重表现生产劳动与爱国主义精神的结合；因而从画面上就看不出新社会的生产劳动与过去情况的根本区别。还有不少的作者在大量制作“娃娃戏”，将一切严肃的斗争都装进儿童游戏里面去，这也说明作者脱离了现实斗争，因而缺乏正面描写斗争的能力。在人物形象方面，有的作者在江南发行的年画里描绘着陕北的风土人物，有的作者把北方的骡马和南方的水牛硬拉在一起耕作，有的作品仍然歪曲了人民领袖的形象，有的作者继续不自觉地将劳动人民的形象加以丑化……当然，形成这些缺点的主要缘故，是由于作者脱离了实际生活，是由于作者缺乏思想锻炼和技术修养，同时，也由于作者对于新年画创作还缺乏严肃认真的态度。
    另外一种缺点，是新年画创作逐渐脱离了民间年画的优良传统，忽视了民间年画与广大人民发生联系的积极因素。比如在内容方面，民间年画中经常反映着人民对于生活的理想，对于幸福的追求，对于美好人物的怀念和对于祖国山河的爱好；通过年画表现出来的，就是那些平安、吉利、多子、长寿之类的题材和那些人物、风景、历史故事、民间传说之类的画种，这些题材和画种在今天不是不可以运用的，而且完全可以和今天新的生活内容联系起来的，完全可以和爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学等等思想教育结合起来的，可是在新年画中很少看见这样的作品。在形式方面，民间年画中的四扇屏、农历图、月份牌以及故事幅等等，是中国人民历来所喜爱的，也是适合广大群众的欣赏习惯的，可是在新年画作品中运用这种形式的也在逐渐减少；代替它们的是一些单调的西洋画幅形式，甚至在表现方法上也出现了不适合于年画形式的油画和钢笔画的西洋作风；这种轻视与脱离民间年画传统的现象，是应当在今后新年画创作中加以纠正的。二、加强新年画创作的领导是
    提高新年画质量的重要关键
    反映在新年画作品中的缺点，归结起来，也正是创作领导工作上的缺点。
    新年画创作是美术普及工作中一个重要的方面，它已经在中国人民的文化生活中占有一个固定的位置；它今年表现什么，明年表现什么，不仅要与广大人民的政治、经济、文化生活直接相关，而且还要与当前的政治宣传和思想教育取得密切的配合；因此，新年画的创作内容，就直接联系到社会实际生活中的各个方面，很多有关创作的实际问题，都不是创作者个人所能完全解决的，而是需要一种有组织有计划的领导来帮助他们解决的。
    就新年画创作的目前情况来说，不可否认，还停留在一种无组织无计划的状态里面；新年画的绘制工作基本上还是一种个人手工业的方式；作者只能根据个人的主观愿望来进行创作，并不是根据客观实际的需要来进行创作；创作计划是按照个人或小工作单位来制订的，而不是按照地区的具体情况来统一制订的；创作资料是由个人所收集的很不完全的材料（片面现象），而不是有组织的通过各个行政工作部门所整理出来的材料。此外，自从全国解放以来，不少有创作经验的美术工作者都担任了创作以外的工作，放弃了创作或者把新年画创作当成临时的突击任务；而新的美术工作者，既缺乏对于生活实际的了解，政治学习又很不经常，有不少的作者把新年画创作看作一年一度的老样文章；就从个人的创作条件和思想准备来说，也是非常不够的。在这样的创作情况之下，新年画的作品内容，就不能不走到脱离实际，就很难含有现实教育意义，就势必发生和广大群众的要求脱节的现象。
    一种社会的艺术活动，却没有运用社会的力量来保证它的正确完成，问题的关键就在这里。
    所以就必须归结到创作的领导问题，而且首先是创作的组织领导问题，因为只要有组织地运用社会的集体方式帮助作者进行创作，才能清除无目的无计划的盲目创作现象，才能保证作品质量的提高。根据目前的一般情况，新年画创作的领导方式还局限在动员创作、拟写创作提纲和审定画稿三个方面，而创作提纲又常常是缺乏具体内容的空洞条文，这种提纲不但不能解决作者在创作上的具体问题，而且助长了创作上的公式主义倾向。至于审定画稿，也只能在整顿出版工作上发生效果，而不能在指导创作和提高创作质量上起有积极作用。这种创作领导方式必须改变，而且必须针对目前创作方式上的缺点来加强创作组织工作，确定创作的原则和工作进行的具体步骤，其重点包括在这样几个方面：
    （一）应当肯定新年画创作与实际情况结合的重要性，必须根据本地区政治、经济、文化发展的实际情况和需要，根据生产建设中的英雄模范事迹和人民生活中涌现出来的新鲜事物来制订统一的创作计划，这种创作计划不但要有具体的内容，而且还要配合搜集与计划有关的创作资料，使作者能够先掌握材料然后才进行创作。领导新年画创作的文教部门，应当把制订计划和搜集材料等具体工作，当作领导创作中一个重要的部分。
    （二）创作资料的分配和创作计划的执行，必须在美术工作单位中进行深入的讨论，使作者在创作思想上有充分的准备。在必要的时候，应当帮助作者到农村或工厂中去生活，使作者能够正确的认识生活和表现生活。
    （三）应当肯定创作实践与创作学习结合的重要性，必须组织新旧作者共同研究创作和研究政策，召开讨论会和作品初搞观摩会，使老作家能够指导新作家，使创作经验能够互相交流，使作品的缺点能够及时纠正。领导新年画创作的美术团体，应当把这种学习组织工作，当作领导创作中一个不可缺少的部分。
    （四）必须根除那种只顾创作不问效果的脱离群众的现象。美术工作团体应当广泛征集群众对于新年画作品的意见，并将这些意见加以整理和研究，作为提高和改进新年画创作的重要根据。三、改造民间年画不能脱离
    民间年画的传统
    新年画是在民间年画的基础上发展起来的。制作新年画和改造民间年画是一个工作的两个方面，制作新年画必须继承民间年画的优良传统，这才不至于和群众的要求脱节；改造民间年画必须符合新年画的发展方向，这才不至于和人民的生活脱节；两者互相关联，是不可任意分割的。
    但目前无论在制作和出版方面，新年画与民间年画之间都存在着一种互不相关各行其是的状态；新年画制作者忽视民间年画的存在，也不注意民间年画的改造问题。民间年画则原封不动的照旧出版，或者乱加改造（如在“三笑姻缘”的画面上添加“打破阶级观念，追求侍女配偶”的荒谬标语），形成年画出版工作上一种混乱的情况。
    现在应该是结束这种情况的时候，应该把民间年画的改造工作提到美术工作者的工作日程上来。这里就必须接触到两个重大的问题：一个是改造的方针问题。一个是改造的办法问题。
    那么，改造民间年画的方针是什么呢？
    曾经出现过这样的论调，认为民间年画是封建社
    会的产物，所以民间年画的内容就全是些封建、迷
    信和其它落后意识的东西，应该全部革掉；甚至对民间艺人和月份牌画家的表现技术也提出了抗议，这种议论在民间年画艺人中曾经起过很不好的影响。当然，民间年画中的确含有许多封建迷信和色情丑恶的东西，否则就无须进行改造。但是封建性仅仅是民间年画内容的一面，也还有民主性的一面，如果没有民主性的一面，民间年画就不可能在今天仍然流行。因此，改造民间年画的原则方针，就是要按照毛主席所说的“剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸取其民主性的精华”，就是要将民间年画中的封建性和民主性加以区别，就是要将民间年画的内容和形式加以区别。凡是对人民有利的而且为人民所喜爱的，都应该保留；凡是对人民有害的，既使人民还不知道它的害处，也应该加以改革。对内容和形式采取全部否定态度是不对的。
    那么，改造民间年画的办法又是怎样呢？
    曾经有过这样的办法，要民间艺人丢掉他的本行，一律改画现实斗争的题材，这就使民间艺人遇到了难关。因为民间艺人有的是专门画风景，有的是专门画美人，有的是专门画翎毛花卉，专门技术是不能马上就可以改变的，那么怎样办呢？出路只有两条：一条是暂不改造，照旧画他原来会画的内容；一条是真的在表现现实斗争的题材了，可是结果表现出了错误的内容和错误的形象；事实证明，性急的办法是行不通的。
    这就说明了一个问题，民间年画的改造和民间艺人的改造是同样的不能脱离原有传统的。改造的办法，一方面是继承原有的优良传统，一方面是在新内容的基础上改造旧的传统。民间年画中既然有可以肯定的题材和画种；民间艺人也当然有表现这类题材和画种的能力；因此，风景画就不是不可以改造的，只要是表现了我们祖国的锦绣山河，何尝不能与爱国主义精神结合；美女画也不是不可以改造的，只要是画的劳动人民的美女，何尝不可以与生产劳动观念结合；翎毛花果也不是不可以画的，如果你配合了土产物资的宣传，也还能起一定的作用；胖娃娃也不是不可以画的，如果你配合了妇婴卫生的宣传，也还能得到教育人民的效果；其它如历史故事、民间传说及地方戏曲等等也都是可以画的，只要能够从这类题材中发扬中国人民的勤劳、勇敢、爱国精神和健康思想……这样，我们就给民间年画的改造工作开辟了一条宽阔的道路，既是与现实生活和革命斗争结合的道路，同时又是可以让民间艺人可以走通的道路。
    因为这样，改造民间年画的中心问题，也就是组织民间年画艺人进行学习和给予他们具体的指导问题。
    应当肯定，民间年画艺人（包括月份牌画家）是具有丰富的创作经验的，他们熟悉人民的艺术爱好，精通年画的制作方法，只要帮助他们进行一定时期的政治学习和业务学习，他们是完全可以负起改造民间年画的任务的。但这里有一个重要的过程，这就是在创作实践上，必须要有新的美术工作者和他们共同合作，这种合作不是空洞的口头说教，而是切实耐心的具体帮助；不仅是给他们出题目做文章，而是给他们筹划具体的创作内容，供给他们必要的参考资料，使他们在开始创作时就具有信心，就能够愉快的胜任。在这种合作之中，新的美术工作者不要干涉他们的原有技术，不要将他们的毛笔改为钢笔，不要将他们的木刻改为石印，只应积极地帮助他们表现方法上的改进，帮助他们在制作技术上的加工。而且，新的美术工作者还可以学习他们技术上的长处，学习他们在技术上联系群众的道理；只有在这样的合作情况之下，民间年画的改造才能顺利的进行和胜利的完成。新旧美术工作者应当把这种合作当作改革社会旧有文化事业的光荣任务。
