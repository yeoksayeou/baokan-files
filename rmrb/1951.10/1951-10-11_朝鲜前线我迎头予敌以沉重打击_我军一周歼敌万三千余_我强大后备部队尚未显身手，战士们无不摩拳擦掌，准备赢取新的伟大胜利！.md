Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 10th: Our front-line reporter reports: After suffering disastrous defeats in the central and eastern lines during their so-called "Summer Limited Offensive," Li Qiqwei and Fan Foeliet announced the start of their so-called "Autumn Offensive" on the 30th of last month. This offensive began on the morning of September 29th in front of our Night Moon Mountain outpost. Now, along the 40-mile front on the western line, the enemy's so-called "large-scale offensive involving five divisions and over 100,000 men" has continued for ten days, and the attack is still underway along the entire line. After the enemy's offensive began, our front-line soldiers, filled with hatred for the enemy, fought bravely, inflicting heavy and annihilating blows on the enemy who ventured to invade. According to incomplete statistics, from September 29th to October 6th, in one week, we killed, wounded, and captured 9,841 enemy troops. Adding the 3,525 enemy troops killed, wounded, and captured in the central and eastern lines, the total reaches 13,366. Our army also captured a significant amount of weapons.

	When the reporter interviewed soldiers at the front-line positions, they were all smiling, sharing stories of the battles and their glorious achievements. The enemy attacked our Night Moon Mountain position for two days and was killed, wounded, and captured with around 1,000 men. The enemy attacked our Tiande Mountain area for five days and nights, suffering a total of over 7,000 casualties. The enemy has attacked Maryang Mountain for four days, suffering about 1,500 casualties, and Maryang Mountain is still being firmly defended by us. Each time the enemy attacks, they first blindly bombard with intense artillery fire and send large numbers of aircraft and tanks to frantically strafe and bomb, then drive infantry in units of companies, battalions, and regiments in a sheep-like, swarm-style charge. For the attacking enemy, our army calmly waits until the enemy enters our firing range, then inflicts serious casualties with fierce firepower and counterattacks with overwhelming force. Under the blows of our army, American soldiers fall in batches, their corpses littering the fields as they flee in disarray. After the first attack failed, American officers drove their soldiers to launch repeated attacks, until they were repeatedly beaten to a pulp by our army and were forced to quiet down. Sometimes our army also temporarily and actively withdraws from several hilltops, luring the enemy to advance, and taking advantage of their unstable foothold, launches a counterattack in one fell swoop, defeating them, not only retaking the original position but also killing a large number of their effectives.

	According to the current situation, the enemy is suffering at least 1,500 casualties per day on the Korean battlefield, and 50,000 casualties per month. The Korean mountains are undulating and stretch for thousands of miles. If the enemy truly dares to continue their large-scale offense, let's see how many lives these war-mongers are prepared to gamble. Now, the powerful reserve forces of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have yet to show their skills, and the soldiers are all eager to try their hands, vying to volunteer to kill the enemy, preparing to win new great victories!

    朝鲜前线我迎头予敌以沉重打击
    我军一周歼敌万三千余
    我强大后备部队尚未显身手，战士们无不摩拳擦掌，准备赢取新的伟大胜利！
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】本社前线记者报道：李奇微、范佛里特在其所谓“夏季有限攻势”于中线、东线遭受惨败之后，在上月三十日又宣布所谓“秋季攻势”开始。这一攻势是在九月二十九日清晨，在我夜月山前哨阵地前开始的。现在，沿西线四十哩前线，敌人叫嚣的包括“五个师十余万人的大规模的攻势”，已延续十天，进攻仍在全线进行中。敌人进攻开始后，我前线战士们无不敌忾填胸，英勇作战，迎头给予冒险进犯的敌人沉重的歼灭性的打击。据不完全统计，从上月二十九日至本月六日的一星期内，我毙伤俘敌即达九千八百四十一名，如果加上中线，东线毙伤俘敌三千五百二十五名，即共达一万三千三百六十六名。我军并缴获了不少武器。
    当记者在前沿阵地采访时，战士们都笑容满面，向记者畅谈战斗经过和辉煌战绩。敌人对我夜月山阵地曾攻击了两天，被我打死打伤俘虏约一千余名。敌人对我天德山一带阵地攻击达五昼夜，死伤共七千余人。敌人对马良山已攻了四天，伤亡约一千五百人，马良山现仍在我坚守中。敌人每一次进攻都是先以强烈炮火盲目乱轰，并出动大批飞机、坦克，疯狂扫射轰击，然后驱使步兵以连、营、团为单位作羊群式的蜂拥冲锋。对于进攻的敌人，我军从容不迫，待敌人进到我火力网内，即以猛烈火力予以严重杀伤，复以排山倒海之势进行反击。在我军打击下，美军士兵们一批又一批地倒下，尸横遍野，狼狈逃窜。在第一次进攻失败后，美军军官就驱策其士兵作轮番进攻，直至一而再、再而三地为我军打得落花流水后，才被迫安静下来。有时我军也暂时主动地撤离几个山头，诱敌前进，乘其立脚未稳，一鼓反击，将其打垮，不仅夺回原有阵地，并大量杀伤其有生力量。
    根据现在情况来看，敌人在朝鲜战场上平均每天至少要死伤一千五百人左右，每月就要有五万人的伤亡。朝鲜山岭起伏，绵亘千里，如果敌人真胆敢继续大举冒犯，看这些战争贩子们准备用多少人命作赌博。现在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的强大后备部队尚未显身手，战士们无不摩拳擦掌，纷纷请缨杀敌，准备赢取新的伟大胜利！
