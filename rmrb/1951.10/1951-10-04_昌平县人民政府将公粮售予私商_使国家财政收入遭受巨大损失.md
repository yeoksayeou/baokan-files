    Changping County People's Government Sells Public Grain to Private Merchants, Causing Huge Losses to National Fiscal Revenue
    To the Editor:
    The People's Government of Changping County, Hebei Province, sold a portion of its stored public grain, totaling one million jin of white corn and 440,300 jin of soybeans, to private merchants at a low price, causing huge losses to national fiscal revenue.
    This spring, when the Tong County Special District held a joint meeting of county finance section chiefs, it was decided that each county should entrust the sale of stored miscellaneous grains to the Special Commissioner's Office or the county's public trust company. When Changping County sold this batch of grain, it consulted with the Special Commissioner's Office Trust Company; the trust company had already decided to purchase 500,000 jin of corn and 400,000 jin of soybeans; however, Shi Fuliang, deputy section chief of the Changping County Government Finance Section, believed that the trust company was a "commercial organization that takes profits and avoids losses," and that "the trust company has no losses to bear, and the finance section will suffer," so he was unwilling to sell the grain to the trust company. In addition, as the weather was gradually getting hotter and the stored grain was at risk of rotting, the county finance section allowed Zhong Qizhang, the chief of the county government's general affairs section, to sell the grain in Beijing. Zhong Qizhang received instructions from Cui Zhaohua, the head of Changping County, to "handle it as you see fit," and sold one million jin of white corn and 440,370 jin of soybeans to ten grain merchants, including Sun Liangyu and Yang Guitong. The selling price of white corn was 510 yuan per jin (40 yuan lower than the price offered by the public trust company), and the selling price of soybeans was 800 yuan per jin (12.3 yuan lower than the price offered by the public trust company); thus, national property suffered huge losses. Shi Fuliang, of the Changping County Finance Section, learned of this situation and believed that the government had suffered too much loss, and tried to prevent the grain merchants from shipping the grain; however, the county head and the chief of the general affairs section said that "the government has a contract with the grain merchants," and "in order to maintain the government's credibility," ordered relevant personnel to allow the private merchants to ship the grain. I believe that the actions of the Changping County head and the chief of the county government's general affairs section are wrong and should be reviewed.

    昌平县人民政府将公粮售予私商
    使国家财政收入遭受巨大损失编辑同志：
    河北省昌平县人民政府将该县所存一部公粮，计白玉米一百万斤，黄豆四十万四千三百余斤，低价售给私商，使国家财政收入遭受了巨大的损失。
    今春通县专区召开县财政科长联席会议时，曾决定各县出售库存杂粮，应委托专署或县的公营信托公司办理。昌平县出售这批粮食时，曾经和专署信托公司洽商；信托公司已决定收购玉米五十万斤，黄豆四十万斤；但昌平县政府财政科副科长史福亮认为信托公司是“商业性机关，有利就取，无利不进”、“信托公司无亏可吃，吃亏者是财政科”，因而不愿把粮食卖给信托公司。加以当时天气渐热，库存粮食有霉烂的危险，该县财政科就让县政府总务科长锺启章，到北京售粮。钟启章得到昌平县县长崔照华“看着办”的指示，即将白玉米一百万斤，黄豆四十万四千三百七十斤，售给孙良玉、杨桂桐等十家粮商。白玉米售价每斤五百一十元（较公营信托公司出价低四十元），黄豆每斤八百元（较公营信托公司出价低十二元三角）；这样，就使国家资财遭受了巨大的损失。昌平县财政科史福亮知道了这种情形，认为政府吃亏太大，曾阻止粮商启运这批粮食；但该县县长与总务科长却说“政府与粮商订有合同”，“为了保持政府的信用”，仍命令有关人员，准予私商启运。我认为，昌平县县长及该县政府总务科长这种作法是错误的，应该检讨。关心
