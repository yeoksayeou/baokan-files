    Chaotic Student Recruitment by Some Agencies Still Occurring in Liaocheng Area
    Recently in the Liaocheng area, the phenomenon of agencies and professional departments randomly recruiting students who are already enrolled in schools continues to occur. Some students, without the school's permission, directly apply for recruitment after obtaining letters of introduction from the Cultural and Educational Sections of the District Government or County People's Government. This not only affects the students' learning motivation but also hinders the implementation of the school's educational plan. Taking our grade (two classes) as an example, after the summer vacation started, we had to merge into one class due to the decrease in the number of students. Among the students who left the school, eleven have been admitted to the Liaocheng Central Branch of the People's Bank. The school sent a special person to negotiate, but no results were achieved.
    The State Council of the Central People's Government has already made clear regulations regarding this issue. Why does the Liaocheng Central Branch of the People's Bank not implement these regulations when recruiting new personnel? Why is no action taken after the situation is discovered? We suggest that the Liaocheng Central Branch of the People's Bank and other professional departments earnestly abide by the government's regulations and stop the chaotic student recruitment.

    城地区仍发生某些机关单位乱招学生的混乱现象
    聊城地区近来仍不断发生机关、专业部门乱招在校学生的现象，一部分同学不经学校许可，在取得区政府或县人民政府文教科的介绍信后即迳往投考。因此不仅影响了同学们的学习情绪，而且也妨碍了学校教育计划的实施。单以我们这一级（两个班）而论，暑期开学后，由于人数减少，不得不合并成一班。离校的同学中先后有十一人考入人民银行聊城中心支行。学校方面曾派专人前去交涉，但始终没有结果。
    中央人民政府政务院对于这个问题，早已作了明确的规定，中国人民银行聊城中心支行在招收新人员时为什么不执行这个规定呢？既经发现，又为什么迟迟不作处理呢？我们建议中国人民银行聊城中心支行以及其他专业部门，切实遵守政府的规定，停止乱招学生的混乱现象。
