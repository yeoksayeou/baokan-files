    We Conducted an Ideological Examination Before Participating in Land Reform Work
    Editor's Note: The following is an excerpt from a letter written by comrades Fan Rong and Wang Yiming of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Women Workers Department to the department after participating in land reform work:
    We arrived in Jiangmen City, Guangdong on the 5th. We passed through Hankou and Guangzhou along the way. At each place, we listened to reports from the local government leaders on land reform work. Combining these reports with our own thinking, we examined whether our motives for participating in land reform were pure. Were we of one mind (of one mind with the peasants, unconditionally serving the peasants)? Or were we of half a mind (putting personal interests first, participating in land reform but still thinking about other things, not submitting to the interests of the work)? Or were we of two minds (not serving the peasants, but serving the landlord class)? The results of the examination confirmed that the vast majority of comrades were basically of one mind, but it cannot be said that there were no problems at all. For example, some comrades wanted to take this opportunity to travel and enjoy the scenery. This is essentially still half-hearted. We thought about how we often approached work from a place of interest since joining the revolution, and this was also only half-hearted. This time, the study of land reform has raised our thinking a step further, making us realize that participating in the revolution should be about serving the people wholeheartedly. We must strive to approach any work with one mind. This is the first lesson of land reform work.

    我们参加土地改革工作前，对思想作了检查
    编者按：这是中华全国总工会女工部范容、王以明两同志参加土地改革工作后写给该部的一封信的摘要：
    我们已于五日抵达广东江门市。沿途经过汉口、广州。每到一处，都听了当地政府首长关于土地改革工作的报告。我们结合报告，联系自己思想，检查了参加土地改革的动机是不是纯？是一条心呢（和农民一条心，无条件地为农民服务）？还是半条心（把个人利益放在第一位，既参加了土地改革，心中又惦记着别的，不服从工作的利益）或是两条心（不是为农民服务，而是为地主阶级服务）？检查结果，肯定了绝大多数同志基本上是一条心的，但还不能说完全没有毛病。如有的同志想借此机会游山玩水。这实质上还是半条心。我们想到自己参加革命以来，对待工作往往从兴趣出发，这也只是半条心。这次，关于土地改革的学习，使我们的思想提高一步，认识到参加革命就应该全心全意为人民服务。我们一定要争取对待任何工作都是一条心。这是土地改革工作的第一课。
