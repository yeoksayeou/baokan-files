    “Long Live Chairman Mao!”
    —A Record of the “Exhibition of Gifts and Cultural Relics from Old Revolutionary Base Areas”
    By our reporter Bai Yuan
    In Beijing’s Zhongshan Park these past few days, the “Exhibition of Gifts and Cultural Relics from Old Revolutionary Base Areas” has been held. What is exhibited here is only a portion of the gifts and cultural relics brought back by the Central People's Government’s visiting delegations to the old base areas, and mostly from the old base areas of the South. Along a long corridor, many silk banners given by the people of various old base areas are hung. Walking through this corridor of silk banners, in the first exhibition room, many cultural relics preserved from the old base areas are displayed: various handwritten, stone-carved, and lithographed Marxist-Leninist works, as well as some articles written by Comrade Mao Zedong at the time, various documents and propaganda materials; various banknotes, currencies, badges, and seals used in the old base areas at the time; various weapons used in the struggle against the enemy and other items of great commemorative value. Among these cultural relics, there is a “Money Collection Book for Helping Buy Airplanes by the Masses” from the “Hengdian Township Revolutionary Committee,” which was preserved in the Central Base Area in 1933. Although airplanes were not bought at the time due to circumstances, the masses’ wishes at that time have been realized today. In the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Base Area, there is a red flag presented by the "Youth League Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Provincial Committee" to Hu Qiurong, the wife of Yao Wanglin of Wanli No. 2 Village, Yangli District, Yiyang County (who was killed by the Kuomintang in 1934). Nothing is written on the flag except for two large characters: “Victory.” Hu Qiurong, in order to attest to these two words, has kept it until today. There is a red flag from the Sichuan-Shaanxi border area base, which was handed over by martyr Li Jiajun to a farmer, Du Wenjin, in 1929 when the situation was critical. Du Wenjin hid it in the hollow of an ancient tree and only took it out after liberation. Next to this red flag is a wooden seal, almost half a foot in diameter, which looks as if it has been chopped with an axe, with a small half missing, but the large five-pointed star with a hammer and sickle engraved on it can still be clearly seen. This is a large wooden seal used in areas where the people had seized political power during the First Revolutionary Civil War, and it was later kept in a village that had been ravaged countless times by the enemy. In addition, there is a plaque that reads "Pingjiang Tenth District Seventh Township Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Soviet Government," which was collected by a farmer surnamed Jiang from Qingping Township, Sixth District, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, in 1931 when the revolutionary situation was critical, and was only taken out last year. It proves to us that the will of the revolutionary people cannot be chopped down by any axe.
    Among the many combat weapons of the time, there were various kinds of rifles, pistols, iron or ceramic hand grenades, broadswords, bayonets, daggers, spears, sharp stakes.... There is a specially made sickle, straight in the middle and curved on one side. This was the weapon used by Zhu Lunzhong, the militia captain of the Second District, Dengfang Township, Nanxiong County, Guangdong, for both production and combat during the First Revolutionary Civil War. There are two exquisite small swords, completely identical in length and size, placed together here, one with a red tassel wrapped around the hilt and the other with a green tassel. The green sword was used by martyr Lin Wanyi of Panling Dongzhou Township, Jieyang County, Guangdong, in the militia, and later left to his son. The red sword was used by Lin Xihua, a member of the township militia, who still lives in Panling Dongzhou Township. Both of these small swords were collected and preserved by him. There is a broadsword two or three feet long, commonly known as a "ghost-head knife," which was the weapon used by a soldier named Deng Yeyu from the Hubei-Henan-Anhui base area after he joined the revolution in 1927. In 1929 and 1930, he used this broadsword to fight the enemy and kill many of them. After Deng Yeyu left with the Red Army in 1932, he left the broadsword at home, and his younger brother, Deng Yezhong, took it over and kept it until now. Another broadsword preserved by Lu Daoyou, a farmer from Datang Township, Nanxiong County, Guangdong, was issued to Lu Yuansheng of Datang Township when he joined the Red Guards in 1927. In 1930, when the local peasants revolted, Lu Yuansheng used this broadsword to kill the local tyrant. Before Lu Yuansheng was arrested and sacrificed, he hid the broadsword in the wall, and it was later discovered by Lu Daoyou. There is a rifle from 1929, which a Red Guard soldier from the Hubei-Henan-Anhui base area left to his younger brother, Tao Zhiying. After he transferred with the Red Army and left his hometown, Tao Zhiying hid the rifle in a pond. Later, when the pond dried up, he buried it in the field he cultivated, and only took it out from the ground after the Liberation Army went south.
    Along with these cultural relics are many things that will forever remain in our memory. From those backpacks, ammunition pouches, armbands, and hats, we can still see what they looked like at that time. A Red Army soldier from the Hubei-Henan-Anhui base area named Zhou Xianfa was shot in the left chest by an enemy bullet while attacking a village inhabited by the enemy in 1931. The bullet remained in his body for twenty years, and was only removed from his left waist last year. He sent it here so that we would not forget that sea of ​​blood and deep hatred. A woman named Wu Zeng Guidi from Wuhua County, Guangdong, had her family looted by Kuomintang bandits on February 26, 1928. Having lost everything, she used a broken earthenware bowl to cook porridge and boil water, and only borrowed a pot for cooking rice from relatives and friends after two months. So she carefully preserved this broken earthenware bowl as a souvenir, keeping it for twenty-three years. She said it was because she knew that the Communist Party would return one day. There is a delicate porcelain tea canister, which is the relic of a soldier from Xinpan Township, Twelfth District, Pingjiang, Hunan. When this soldier went north with the army, he gave this tea canister to his son. In 1931, when the local environment was harsh, this soldier's son used a large earthenware jar to pack it up and buried it in the vegetable garden behind his house, where it remained buried for eighteen years, only to be taken out after liberation in 1949. In the middle of the exhibition room, along with other larger items, there is a section of thick bamboo cut from a bamboo pole with slogans carved on it: “Implement Land Revolution,” “Long Live the Success of the Chinese Revolution.” This was carved in 1931 by Zheng Kaicheng, the secretary of the Youth League District Committee in Pingjiang County, Hunan. There were a total of six bamboo plants with slogans carved on them, all growing in Gujiadong Village, Huanxin Township, Seventh District, Pingjiang County. Zheng Kaicheng was killed by Kuomintang bandits in 1933, but thanks to the careful protection of the local people, these bamboo plants have grown to the thickness of a rice bowl after twenty years.
    In the gift exhibition room, many foods, clothing, and utensils are displayed, and almost every item has the same sentence written on it: “Dedicated to our beloved Chairman Mao.” Jin Xingshu, a martyr’s family member from Xiaoyingzi Village, Yanji County, Northeast China, sent a set of tableware used by the martyr Jin Xuejun during his lifetime to Chairman Mao. Today, as we look at those bowls and dishes, as we look at those chopsticks, we should think of our happy life; we should think of how many people shed their blood for this life. Among the many items, there is a pair of maroon thread socks, which an old grandmother (a martyr’s family member) from the new market in Yan’an bought and sent to Chairman Mao. On this pair of socks, this old grandmother sewed a sturdy sole for Chairman Mao with dense stitches. We seem to see her sewing stitch by stitch under the lamp at night, wanting to sew all her thoughts into this pair of soles. We also seem to see this old grandmother walking out of the new market in Yan'an in the morning, holding her sewn socks in her hand. She was thinking of Chairman Mao in Beijing, just like she used to think of Yangjialing in Yan’an. In another place where many foods sent by the people of the old base areas are displayed, there is a bottle of sesame oil for cooking, which a martyr’s family member from Guidong County, Hunan, put in a small cologne bottle and sent to Chairman Mao. How much unspeakable words and how much of the most precious emotions in the world are contained in these things! After a working woman visited the exhibition, a comrade working at the exhibition asked her what she thought. She said, "I can't speak, and I can't write..." She thought for a while, and finally only said one sentence: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" Four military comrades who came here to visit wrote in the exhibition's opinion book after seeing the exhibition: "Comrade Mao Zedong, you are so great! We will always hold our guns tightly, defend the motherland, and defend world peace until imperialism is finally destroyed."

    “毛主席万岁！”
    ——记“人民革命老根据地礼品文物展览会”
    本报记者    白原
    这几天，在北京的中山公园内，举行了一个“人民革命老根据地礼品文物展览会”。这里所展览的东西，只是中央人民政府各老根据地访问团带回来的礼品和文物的一部分，而且大多数是南方老根据地人民所赠送的一部分。沿着一道长长的走廊，挂满了各老根据地人民送来的锦旗。从这一道锦旗的走廊走进去，在第一间展览室里，摆满了许多从各老根据地所保存下来的文物：各种手抄、石刻、石印的马列主义的著作以及毛泽东同志当时所写的一些文章，各种文件及宣传品；当时老根据地所用的各种钞票、货币、证章、印信；与敌人作斗争的各种武器及其他极有纪念价值的物品。在这些文物中间，有一本“横店乡革命委员会”的“群众帮助买飞机钱数簿”，那是一九三三年在中央根据地保存下来的。当时因为环境的关系，飞机虽然没有买到，但是当时的群众的愿望，在今天实现了。在闽浙赣根据地，有一面“少共闽浙赣省委会”献给弋阳县洋里区湾里二村姚旺林（一九三四年为国民党杀害）的妻子胡秋荣的红旗，旗上什么也没有写，只写了两个大字：“胜利”。胡秋荣为了给这两个字作证，把它一直保存到现在。有一面川陕边根据地的红旗，是李家俊烈士在一九二九年当局势紧急时交给一位农民杜文锦保存下来的。杜文锦把它藏在一棵古树洞内，一直到解放以后才取出来。靠着这一面红旗的旁边，摆着一颗差不多有半尺直径这么大的木头印，好像是曾被斧头砍过的一样缺了一小半边，但依然可以清楚地看见印上所刻的一个带着斧头镰刀的大五角星。这是第一次国内革命战争时期在人民掌握了政权的地方所用的一颗大木印，后来被保留在一个曾被敌人摧残过无数次的乡村中。此外，还有一块“平江第十区第七乡工农兵苏维埃政府”的牌子，一九三一年当革命形势紧急时，由湖南平江县六区清平乡一位姓江的农民收藏起来，直到去年才取出来。它为我们证明了，革命人民的意志，无论什么斧头也砍它不掉的。
    在许多当时的战斗武器里面，有各种各样的长枪、手枪、铁制或瓷制的手榴弹、大刀、刺刀、短刀、长矛、尖串……。有一把特制的镰刀，中间是直的，一边是弯的。这是广东南雄县二区邓坊乡三村民兵队长朱伦忠在第一次国内革命战争时期用来进行生产和战斗的武器。有两把长短大小完全一样的精致的小剑，在这里一同放在一起，一把剑柄缠着红色绒线，一把剑柄缠着绿色绒线。绿色小剑是广东揭阳县盘岭东州乡林万意烈士在自卫队中所用，后来留下给他的儿子的。红色小剑是乡自卫队队员林锡华所用的。他现在仍住在盘岭东州乡。这两把小剑都是经他收藏保存下来的。有一把二、三尺长的大刀，俗名叫做“鬼头刀”，是鄂豫皖根据地一位叫做邓业余的战士在一九二七年参加革命后所用的武器。一九二九年和一九三○年，他用这把大刀与敌人作战，杀过许多的敌人。一九三二年邓业余随红军走了以后，将大刀留在家里，他的弟弟邓业忠便把它接过来，一直保存到现在。另一把广东南雄县大塘乡农民芦道有所保存的大马刀，是大塘乡的芦元生在一九二七年参加赤卫队时发给他的。一九三○年当地农民起义，芦元生用这把大马刀杀死过当地的土豪。在芦元生被捕牺牲之前，他将这把大马刀藏在墙壁里，后来被芦道有发现。有一枝一九二九年时期的来福枪，是鄂豫皖根据地一位赤卫队的战士给他的弟弟陶治英留下来的，自从他随红军一起转移，离开家乡以后，陶治英将枪藏在池塘里面，后来池塘的水枯了，又转埋在自己耕种的田地里，直到解放军南下以后才从地下取出来。
    和以上这些文物放在一起的，还有许多留给我们永远纪念的东西。从那些背包、子弹袋、臂章、帽子，使我们在今天还能够看见他们那时候的样子。有一个鄂豫皖根据地的红军战士叫周贤发，一九三一年攻打敌人住着的一个村子时，被敌人的子弹从左胸打入，子弹在身体里保留了二十年，一直到去年才从左腰处取出。他把它送到这里来，为了叫我们不要忘记那个血海深仇。一个广东五华县的妇女名叫巫曾桂娣，一九二八年二月二十六日家庭遭国民党匪帮劫掠，一无所存，用一个破瓦钵来煮粥、烧水，过了两个月才向亲友借来了煮饭的锅子，于是她就将这一个破瓦钵小心保存起来，留作纪念，一直保存了二十三年。她说因为她知道，共产党总有一天要回来的。有一个精细的瓷制的茶罐，是湖南平江十二区新蟠乡一个战士的遗物。这个战士随军北上时，将这个茶罐交给了他的儿子。一九三一年当地环境恶劣，这个战士的儿子就用一个大瓦罐把它装起来，埋在自己屋后的菜地里，一直埋了十八年，到一九四九年解放后才取出来。在展览室的当中，和其他几件较大的物品在一起，摆着一截从一株竹杆上截下来的粗大的竹子，上面有刀刻的标语：“实行土地革命”，“中国革命成功万岁”。这是一九三一年湖南平江县的少共区委书记郑楷成所刻的。刻有标语的竹子一共有六株，都长在平江县七区焕新乡的辜家洞村。郑楷成已经在一九三三年被国民党匪帮杀害了，但是因为当地人民的小心保护，经过了二十年，这些竹子一直长到现在，已经长到饭碗这么粗了。
    在礼品展览室里，陈列着许多食品、衣物和用具，差不多每一样东西的上面，都写着一句同样的字句：“献给亲爱的毛主席”。东北延吉县小营子村的一个烈属金信淑，给毛主席送来了烈士金学俊生前所用的一套餐具。今天，当我们看着那些碗碟，看着那一双筷子，我们应当想起我们的幸福的生活；我们应当想起，为了这一个生活，有多少人流了自己的血。在许多的物品中间，有一双酱色的线袜子，是延安新市场的一个老祖母（烈属）买来送给毛主席的。在这一双袜子上，这一个老祖母用密密的针线，为毛主席缝起了结实的袜底。我们好像看见她在夜晚的灯下一针针地缝着，想要把她所有的心意都缝到这一双袜底里。我们又好像看见这一个老祖母在早晨从延安的新市场走出来，手里拿着她这双缝好的袜子。她一心想着北京的毛主席，就好像过去想着延安杨家岭的时候一样。在另一个陈列着许多老根据地人民送来的食品的地方，有一瓶炒菜吃的香油，湖南桂东县的一位烈属把它盛在一只小花露水瓶子里，送给毛主席。在这些东西里面，包藏着多少说不尽的话、多少人间最珍贵的感情！有一个劳动妇女，在看了展览会以后从展览室里走出来，一个在展览会工作的同志问她有什么意见，她说：“我不会说，也不会写，……”她想了一会，最后只说了一句话：“毛主席万岁！”有四个到这里来参观的军人同志，在看完了展览会以后，在展览会的意见簿上写道：“毛泽东同志，你是这样伟大！我们永远握紧手中枪，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平，直到帝国主义最后灭亡。”
