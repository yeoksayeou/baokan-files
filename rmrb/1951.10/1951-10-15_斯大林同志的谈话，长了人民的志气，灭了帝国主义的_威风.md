    Comrade Stalin's Talk Boosted the People's Morale and Crushed the Imperialists' "Prestige"
    Editor:
    After reading the talk by Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of the world's peace-loving people, on the issue of atomic weapons in the newspaper, I felt that this talk was the most powerful and resounding slap in the face that Comrade Stalin, on behalf of the world's peace-loving people, delivered to the American imperialists. To deal with the aggressive American imperialists, it is only by showing them the strength of the people and making them afraid that it is possible to force them to bow their heads before the people. This talk boosted the morale of the people and crushed the "prestige" of the imperialists.
    After reading Comrade Stalin's talk, my heart was filled with love and respect for this great teacher. Under the leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet people are selflessly engaged in the construction of communism, which will not only make the lives of the Soviet people happier, but will also greatly benefit the cause of peace for all mankind. At the same time, I deeply feel the greatness and brilliance of our leader Chairman Mao! The "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" signed last February has further consolidated the friendship between the people of our country and the great Soviet people, provided a more powerful guarantee for the construction of our country, and enabled the people of our country and the Soviet people to jointly shoulder the sacred responsibility of defending the cause of peace. I am a young student, and I must work hard to cultivate myself into a builder of the motherland with both ability and integrity and a healthy physique, and strive to the end for the peace and happiness of mankind!

    斯大林同志的谈话，长了人民的志气，灭了帝国主义的“威风”编辑同志：
    我在报上看了世界爱好和平的人民的伟大导师斯大林同志对原子武器问题的谈话后，我觉得：这个谈话是斯大林同志代表世界爱好和平人民打了美帝国主义者一记最有力、最响亮的耳光。对待侵略成性的美帝国主义，只有把人民的力量摆给他看看，使他感到害怕，才可能迫使它在人民面前低头。这个谈话长了人民的志气，灭了帝国主义的
    “威风”。
    我读了斯大林同志的谈话后，心中充满了对这位伟大导师的热爱和尊敬。在伟大斯大林的领导下，苏联人民正在忘我地进行共产主义的建设事业，这不但将会使苏联人民的生活更加幸福，而且也大大地有益于全人类的和平事业。同时，我更深刻地感到：我们的领袖毛主席的伟大和英明！去年二月订立的“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，使我国人民和伟大苏联人民的友谊更加巩固，使我国的建设事业得到更有力的保障，并使我国人民和苏联人民一同肩负起保卫和平事业的神圣责任。我是一个青年学生，我一定要努力把自己培养成为才德兼备、体格健康的祖国建设者，为人类的和平幸福而奋斗到底！
