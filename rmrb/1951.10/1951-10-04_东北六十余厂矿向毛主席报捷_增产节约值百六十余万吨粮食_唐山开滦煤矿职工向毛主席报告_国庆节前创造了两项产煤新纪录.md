Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang forwarded to Chairman Mao:

Inspired by patriotism, the working class of Northeast China launched a movement to increase production and practice economy, creating wealth equivalent to ten million tons of grain. As of September 29th, according to figures reported in letters, telegrams, and telephone calls to this newspaper from sixty-two factories and mines in Shenyang, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Benxi, Yingkou, Wafangdian, and other places, the wealth created for the state in the increased production and savings movement totaled 1,627,697 tons of grain. A considerable portion of this achievement was made in the months of July, August, and September. For example, a certain railway factory created wealth equivalent to 34,666 tons of grain in the first half of the year, and exceeded the first half of the year by 2,000 tons in July and August alone, reaching 36,666 tons. The increased production and savings movement is developing rapidly. With the enhancement of the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, staff, and technicians, they have brought into play rich wisdom and creativity, put forward rationalization proposals, improved operating methods, improved technology, and improved production management, etc., so that the figures of increased production and savings are growing rapidly. For example, the increased production and savings figures of eight factories in Benxi, converted into grain, are:

    July: 55,259 tons.
    August: 123,139 tons.

The B shift of the second workshop of a certain steel plant, as a result of improving operating methods and increasing output and quality, increased production and savings for the state by an amount equivalent to 43.65 percent of the shift's annual increased production and savings plan in one day. The tremendous potential capacity of Northeast industry and the working class has begun to be tapped due to your correct leadership. This fact has educated all workers, staff, and technicians, making them realize the superiority of the New Democratic economic system and firmly believe that under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the great people's leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have the strength to defeat any enemy and also the strength to build a better and happier society. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all employees extend to you

    our highest respects!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

Respected Chairman Mao:

The great National Day is coming. When the people of the whole country are jubilantly celebrating this great festival, and when workers across the country are greeting National Day with new achievements in production, all 50,000 workers and staff of our Kailuan Coal Mine are reporting to you with unparalleled excitement on the great victory on our production front. Under your correct leadership, all our employees have overcome the numerous difficulties left to Kailuan by imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule. Since April of this year, we have launched a patriotic labor emulation campaign. Coal production has been increasing day by day. In September, we responded to the call of the Party and the trade union to break old records and create new records to greet National Day, and further advanced the patriotic labor emulation campaign. All the workers brought into play unprecedented labor enthusiasm and finally created two new records on September 29th that Kailuan had never had in more than seventy years. Daily coal production reached 23,116 tons, exceeding the historical highest daily output of 21,802 tons by 1,314 tons. Rock tunnel excavation also created a new record of 24 feet excavated in three shifts. Chairman Mao, we assure you that we will not only consolidate the achievements we have made, but also continue to work hard, create higher records, and produce more coal for the country. We wish you good health.

    Respectfully submitted by all employees of Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine
    September 30th

    东北六十余厂矿向毛主席报捷
    增产节约值百六十余万吨粮食
    唐山开滦煤矿职工向毛主席报告
    国庆节前创造了两项产煤新纪录东北人民政府高岗主席并转呈毛主席：
    东北工人阶级在爱国主义的鼓舞下，展开了增产节约一千万吨粮食的财富的运动。截至九月二十九日，据沈阳、鞍山、旅大、本溪、营口、瓦房店等地六十二个厂矿委托本报向您报捷的信件、电报、电话所报告的数字，在增产节约运动里，已经给国家创造财富共合粮食一百六十二万七千六百九十七吨。这个成绩有不小一部分，是在七、八、九三个月所做出来的。如某铁路工厂上半年创造的财富折合粮食三万四千六百六十六吨，七、八两个月就超过上半年两千吨，达到三万六千六百六十六吨。增产节约运动正在日益发展，随着广大工人、职员和技术人员爱国热忱的提高，发挥了丰富的智慧和创造力，提出合理化建议，改进操作方法，提高技术，改进生产管理等，使增产节约的数字迅速增长着。如本溪八个工厂，增产节约数字折合粮食是：
    七月：五万五千二百五十九吨。
    八月：十二万三千一百三十九吨。
    某钢厂第二车间乙班由于改进操作法，提高产量质量的结果，一天多给国家增产节约的财富，达到该班全年增产节约计划的百分之四十三点六五。东北工业与工人阶级的巨大潜在能力，由于您的正确领导，已经开始发掘出来。这一个事实，教育了全体工人职员群众，认识到新民主主义经济制度的优越性，深信在中央人民政府、中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛主席领导之下，中国人民有力量战胜任何敌人，也有力量建设更美好更幸福的社会。当此中华人民共和国成立两周年的节日，全体职工谨向您致以
    崇高的敬礼！
    毛主席万岁！劳动日报社
    九月三十日敬爱的毛主席：
    伟大的国庆节到来了。当全国人民欢腾鼓舞庆祝这个伟大节日的时候，当全国各地工人兄弟以生产上的新成绩来迎接国庆的时候，我们开滦煤矿全体五万工人和职员，以无比兴奋的心情，向您报告我们生产战线上的大胜利。我们全体职工在您正确领导下，克服了帝国主义和国民党反动统治给开滦遗留下的重重困难，从今年四月起，展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛。煤产量与日俱增。到九月份，我们响应了党和工会发出的以打破旧纪录创造新纪录迎接国庆的号召，将爱国主义劳动竞赛更向前推进了一步。全体工人发挥了前所未有的劳动热忱，终于在九月二十九日创造了两项开滦七十余年来从未有过的新纪录。日产煤达到二万三千一百一十六吨，全矿区产煤比历史上最高日产量二万一千八百零二吨多出一千三百一十四吨。石洞掘进也创造了三班掘进二十四呎的新纪录。毛主席，我们谨向您保证我们不仅要巩固既得的成绩，而且要继续努力，创造更高的纪录，为国家生产更多的煤炭。谨祝您身体健康。
    唐山开滦煤矿全体职工敬上
        九月三十日
