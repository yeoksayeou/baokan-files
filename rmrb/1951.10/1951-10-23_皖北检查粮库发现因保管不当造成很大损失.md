To the Editor:

This June, the Northern Anhui region launched a comprehensive grain depot inspection campaign, which revealed the following serious problems: 1. Improper storage and careless inspection. For example, the temperature in the Liu Dawei Grain Depot in Lu'an County exceeded nine degrees Celsius, causing 60% of the 12,590 jin of stored wheat to be damaged by insects and rot. The Feixi County Grain Depot entrusted a private rice mill for processing, but due to a lack of inspection, more than 500,000 jin of brown rice were embezzled. 2. The construction of warehouses does not meet standards, and many warehouses lack ventilation equipment. Some cadres lack the knowledge of warehouse construction and supervision skills, resulting in a few private merchants cutting corners. 3. Some grain depots stored grain of very poor quality. For example, in the Matouji Grain Depot in Lu'an County, some of the grain was mixed with 4% impurities. More than 80,000 jin of grain received by the Yuncao District Grain Depot in Hanshan County were damp and uncleaned, resulting in significant losses. These are all manifestations of the serious irresponsibility and lack of care for state property on the part of the grain depot cadres. The above facts show that in the future, grain depots in various regions should strengthen the education of cadres on cherishing the property of the motherland, and teach them knowledge of grain storage and warehouse construction, so as to avoid losses to state property.

    皖北检查粮库发现因保管不当造成很大损失编辑同志：
    今年六月，皖北地区全面展开检查粮库运动，从中发现以下几个严重的问题：一、保管不当，检查马虎。如六安县刘大圩粮库温度超过九度，使存麦一万二千五百九十斤中有百分之六十被虫腐蚀。肥西县粮库委托私营米厂加工，因为缺乏检查，被盗用糙米五十余万斤。二、仓库修建不合规格，很多仓库缺乏通风设备。有的干部缺乏修建仓房常识与监工技术，以致被少数私商偷工减料。三、有的粮库收存的粮食质量很坏。如六安县马头集粮库内，部分粮食掺合了百分之四的杂质。含山县运槽区粮库所收粮食，有八万多斤都是潮湿的毛粮，因而损失很大。这些都是粮库干部严重的不负责任不爱护国家财产的表现。以上事实说明，今后各地粮库对干部应加强爱护祖国财产的教育，并教给他们粮食保管、仓房修建等知识，免使国家财产遭受损失。
