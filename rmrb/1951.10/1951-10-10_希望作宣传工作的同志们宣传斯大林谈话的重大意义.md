    Hoping Comrades Doing Propaganda Work Promote the Great Significance of Stalin's Talk
    Editor:
    After reading Comrade Stalin's talk on the issue of atomic weapons, I felt infinite excitement!
    The Soviet Union has consistently and resolutely advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union has suggested the prohibition of atomic weapons more than once, but each time it was rejected by American imperialism and its vassal states. The American ruling clique attempted to monopolize the production of atomic weapons, but now this shameful attempt by the American ruling clique has completely failed. Comrade Stalin's talk once again pointed out a truth to peace-loving people all over the world: only by firmly holding our own weapons can we make the enemy lay down their weapons.
    As the People's Daily editorial pointed out, Comrade Stalin's talk is a great gospel of world peace. We Chinese people wholeheartedly support Comrade Stalin's talk. I hope that comrades engaged in propaganda work can properly understand the basic spirit of Comrade Stalin's important talk and correctly publicize the great significance of this talk to the masses.

    希望作宣传工作的同志们宣传斯大林谈话的重大意义编辑同志：
    读了斯大林同志关于原子武器问题的谈话，我感到无限的兴奋！
    苏联是一贯坚决主张禁止原子武器的。苏联曾经不止一次地建议禁止原子武器，但是每一次都被美帝国主义及其附庸国家拒绝了。美国的统治集团企图垄断原子武器的生产，但是现在美国统治集团的这种可耻的企图已经完全破产了。斯大林同志的谈话再一次给全世界爱好和平人民指出了一条真理：只有紧握着自己的武器，才能使敌人放下武器。
    诚如人民日报社论所指出的，斯大林同志的谈话是世界和平的伟大福音。我们中国人民衷心地拥护斯大林同志的谈话。我希望作宣传工作的同志能好好领会斯大林同志这个重要谈话的基本精神，正确地向群众宣传这个谈话的重大意义。
