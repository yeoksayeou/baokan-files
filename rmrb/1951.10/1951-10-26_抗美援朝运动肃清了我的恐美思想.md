    The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Cleansed My Fear-of-America Thoughts
    Editor:
    I am an old intellectual. After liberation, although the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people had driven the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was fully supported by the American imperialists, out of mainland China, the fear of America still remained in my mind. I thought that its national strength was rich and strong, and it possessed "atomic bomb" weapons. This poisonous thought was firmly entrenched in my mind even when our volunteer army went abroad to aid Korea in the war. Therefore, when I heard that the United States was a "paper tiger" and that "atomic bombs are not scary," I thought it was just a deceptive statement, just a propaganda slogan. It did not make me truly believe it. However, after our volunteer army went abroad, news of victory came from the Korean battlefield one after another, which made me a little dumbfounded. The facts were educating me; the Chinese people had really "stood up." They not only had the ability to save themselves, but also had the power to help their neighbors. Our country's production and national defense construction have not been hindered by the Resist America, Aid Korea movement; on the contrary, they have made unprecedented progress and development. At the same time, under the agitation of this patriotic and internationalist spirit, the internal unity of our country and the growth of international friendship have been further consolidated and developed. What power has enabled a weak ancient country to leap into one of the world's leading powers in just a few years? I realized that this is the power of Chairman Mao's leadership and the power unleashed by the people of New China.
    Since I realized the greatness of the Chinese nation, the thought of fearing America has been uprooted from my mind, and my actions are no longer hesitant. Therefore, at the suggestion of friends, I resolutely participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea work. Now I feel that my task is glorious and my spirit is happy. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, I would like to write down some of my thoughts.

    抗美援朝运动肃清了我的恐美思想编辑同志：
    我是一个旧知识分子。解放后，虽然中国人民的革命势力已将美帝国主义者所全力支持的蒋介石匪帮驱逐出中国大陆，而我的思想上仍然残存着恐美的思想，认为它的国力富强，拥有“原子弹”武器。这种毒害的思想甚至在我国志愿军出国援助朝鲜作战的当时，还是牢固地盘踞在我的脑里。因此听到说：美国是“纸老虎”，“原子弹不可怕”，以为是欺人之谈，不过是作为宣传的口号罢了。它并没有能使我真信不疑。但是，我国志愿军出国后，从朝鲜战场上一连传来胜利消息，使我简直有点瞠目咋舌了。事实在向我进行教育了，中国人民真的“站起来了”，他不只是有了自救的能力，而且还有力量援助他的邻人。我们国家的生产事业，国防建设，不但没有因为抗美援朝而受阻碍，相反的却更因此得到空前的进步与发展。同时，在这种爱国主义与国际主义精神的激荡之下，使我国内部的团结与国际友爱的增长更得到了进一步的巩固与发展。是什么力量在数年之内能使一个积弱的古国一跃而为世界上的一等强国呢？我认识了这是毛主席的领导和新中国人民发挥出来的力量。
    自从我认识到中华民族的伟大以后，恐美的思想也就从我的头脑里连根拔除了，行动也就不再犹疑了，于是在朋友的建议之下，我便毅然决然地参加了抗美援朝工作。现在我觉得我的任务是光荣的，精神是愉快的，在这抗美援朝运动一周年的时候，我愿写下我的一点感想。
