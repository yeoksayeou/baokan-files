    Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace
    On October 3, 1951, at a gathering where the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace met with delegations of people from various countries who came to China to visit the National Day celebrations, Mr. Guo Moruo mentioned a very important sentence: "People all over the world love peace, but peace cannot be waited for; we must fight to obtain peace."
    The Vietnamese people have long agreed with this statement. Therefore, after the Vietnamese people achieved victory in the August Revolution of 1945, when the French colonialists re-invaded Vietnam on September 23 of the same year, destroying peace, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, united as one and immediately stood up, taking up arms to resist the enemy's aggression, and called on the French people and the people of the world to defend justice and peace.
    For more than five years, the US imperialists have progressed from supplying French colonialists with food and ammunition to attack the Vietnamese people, to directly interfering in the Vietnam-France war. But the Vietnamese people are determined to defend independence, freedom, democracy, and peace, and have determined the goals of the war of resistance: to eliminate the French colonialists and American interventionists.
    The Vietnamese people believe that the US imperialists' interference in Vietnam, aggression against Korea, occupation of Taiwan, arming of Japan, and the recent separate treaty with Japan are all part of their plan to invade Asia and provoke a new world war. Therefore, the Vietnamese people believe that our armed struggle, as well as the armed struggle of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, is a positive way to defend peace in Asia and the world.
    On the other hand, the Vietnamese people enthusiastically respond to every action by the people of the world that is beneficial to peace. After the movements against the Atlantic Pact and against the arming of West Germany, the Vietnamese people have enthusiastically participated in various major movements to defend peace, such as the Stockholm Peace Congress Standing Committee's request to ban the use of atomic weapons, the Berlin Peace Council's request for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, aid the Korean people, oppose the arming of Japan, and oppose a separate treaty with Japan.
    Although the imperialist aggressors are extremely fierce, and they have used all kinds of cunning tricks and barbaric actions to try to destroy the strength of the Vietnamese people and strike at the fighting will of the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese people, in the long-term war of resistance, have already passed through the defensive stage and entered the stalemate stage. On several battlefields, they have already moved from being passive to striving for the initiative, and have annihilated a large number of the enemy's living forces. The longer the war of resistance lasts, the more the military strength of the Vietnamese people develops, the more the political awareness of the Vietnamese people increases, and the more the economy and culture of Vietnam progress day by day.
    Standing in the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, under the guidance of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people constantly look towards Marshal Stalin – the world's number one peace fighter, and towards Chairman Mao Zedong – the supreme leader of the Asian people. We are determined to unite closely with the Asian people and the people of the world, and resolutely fight for peace.
    Close unity, resolute struggle, peace will surely triumph.

    越南人民坚持为保卫和平而团结斗争
    越南保卫世界和平委员会主席  黎庭探
    一九五一年十月三日，在中国的保卫世界和平委员会与来华参观中国国庆典礼的各国人民代表团见面的一次聚会中，郭沫若先生曾提到一句很重要的话：“全世界人民都爱好和平，但和平不能坐待，我们要为获得和平而斗争。”
    越南人民很久以来就同意这一句话。因此，在一九四五年八月革命的越南人民获得胜利以后，同年九月二十三日，法国殖民地主义者重新侵略越南，破坏和平，越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，团结一致，立即站起来，拿着武器，反抗敌人的侵略，并且呼吁法国人民和全世界人民，保卫正义，保卫和平。
    五年多来，美帝国主义者从供给法国殖民者以粮食弹药，进攻越南人民，发展到直接干涉越法战争。但是越南人民决心保卫独立、自由、民主与和平，决定了抗战的目标：消灭法国殖民者和美国干涉者。
    越南人民认为，美帝国主义者干涉越南，侵略朝鲜，占领台湾，武装日本和最近与日本单独缔结和约，都是他们侵略亚洲和挑拨新的世界战争计划的一部分，因此，越南人民认为我们的武装斗争以及朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的武装斗争，是保卫亚洲和世界和平的一种积极斗争方法。
    另一方面，全世界人民的每一种对于和平有利的行动，越南人民都热烈响应。在反对大西洋公约，反对武装西德等运动之后，为保卫和平的各种大运动中，如斯德哥尔摩和平大会常务委员会所提要求禁止使用原子武器，柏林和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约，援助朝鲜人民，反对武装日本和反对与日本单独缔结和约等运动，越南人民都热烈地参加了。
    尽管帝国主义侵略者非常凶狠，他们用了各种狡猾的手段，各种野蛮的行动，企图破坏越南人民的力量，打击越南人民的战斗意志，但越南人民在长期抗战中，已经度过了防御阶段，踏进相持阶段，在好几处战场上，已经从被动进而争取主动，消灭了敌人的大批有生力量。抗战越久，越南人民的军事力量越发展，越南人民的政治觉悟程度越提高，越南的经济、文化也一天比一天进步。
    站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中，在胡志明主席的指引之下，越南人民经常向着斯大林大元帅——世界人民的第一号和平战士，向着毛泽东主席——亚洲人民的最高领袖，决与亚洲人民和全世界人民紧密团结，坚决为和平而斗争。
    紧密团结，坚决战斗，和平一定胜利。
