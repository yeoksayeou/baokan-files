Promote the Good Experiences of the Beijing Labor Bureau in Inspecting Safety and Hygiene Work

The Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau's experience in mobilizing the masses of workers to systematically inspect the safety and hygiene work of factories and mines is worth learning from in various places.

There are two ways to inspect the safety and hygiene work of factories and mines. One is to send people to factories to inspect them one by one. This is the method that the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau used to adopt in the past, which was a handicraft method, and the result was not very effective. The other method is to mobilize the masses of workers to conduct systematic and comprehensive inspections, so as to "find typical examples, report collectively, observe each other, and promote comprehensiveness." This is the method currently adopted by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau.

To inspect the safety and hygiene work of factories and mines, the participation of the masses of workers must be mobilized. Because workers are direct producers and masters of machines; they are most familiar with the situation, understand the importance of strengthening safety and hygiene work, and know which safety and hygiene work should be done early and which can be done later, so as to put forward practical and feasible opinions for leaders to study and adopt.

The inspection of the safety and hygiene work of factories and mines must also be carried out comprehensively in each factory according to the industrial leadership system. Everyone must be mobilized to have a broad effect. In the process of inspection, attention should be paid to selecting good and bad typical examples, mobilizing everyone to observe each other and compare them, so as to promote good typical examples, criticize bad typical examples, and promote common progress in various factories.

    推广北京市劳动局检查安全卫生 工作的好经验
    北京市人民政府劳动局发动工人群众，系统地检查工厂、矿山安全卫生工作的经验，值得各地学习。
    检查工厂、矿山安全卫生工作，可以有两种方法。一种是派人下厂，一厂一厂地检查。这是北京市人民政府劳动局过去曾经采用的方法，这是手工业的方法，结果收效不大。另一种方法，是发动工人群众，进行系统地、全面地检查，以便“找出典型、集体汇报、互相观摩，推动全面”，这是北京市人民政府劳动局现在采用的方法。
    检查工厂、矿山的安全卫生工作，必须发动工人群众参加。因为工人是直接生产者，是机器的掌握者；他们最熟悉情况，最了解加强安全卫生工作的重要性，最懂得那一种安全卫生工作应该早办，那一种可以缓办，从而提出切实可行的意见，供给领导者研究、采纳。
    检查工厂、矿山的安全卫生工作，还须按照产业领导系统，发动各厂全面地进行，必须大家都动起来，才能有广大的效果。在检查过程中，应该注意选择好坏典型，发动大家互相观摩，加以比较，借以提倡好的典型，批判坏的典型，推动各厂共同进步。
