    Safely Driving Sixteen Thousand Three Hundred Kilometers
    Hero Driver of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Xu Jingchun
    I am a driver in the automobile unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. My main job is to transport ammunition, food, and supplies from the rear to the front, and to transfer wounded comrades from the front to the rear.

    In Korea, American aircraft were rampant. It was not only difficult to drive during the day, but even at night, if they spotted us, we would be strafed and bombed. The roads in Korea were not wide to begin with, and the destruction caused by American aircraft made driving very difficult. However, we are the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and we are not afraid of difficulties. In more than four months, I safely drove sixteen thousand three hundred kilometers. My truck was never hit, and none of the supplies I transported were lost. I always kept in mind that the truck came from the motherland, and the supplies were sent by the people of the motherland. Every time I camouflaged the truck, I asked the local people about the enemy aircraft's activities and helped my assistant with the work. After the camouflage was done, I would go up the hillside to see if the truck could be spotted by the enemy aircraft. On the road, I paid even more attention. I had my assistant listen specifically for "anti-aircraft guns." In addition, I was very good at remembering the roads. After running a route three times, I would pretty much remember it, knowing where I could drive fast, where I had to be careful, where there was a bridge, and where I could camouflage...

    The first time I went to Tieyuan to carry out a mission, I reached the vicinity of Machangmian, which is a plain. Enemy aircraft came, first dropping two flares, then strafing and bombing at low altitude. I shut off the engine and listened. The bombs were whistling down. My assistant quickly jumped into a small ditch beside the road, and then I jumped into a bomb crater that was seven or eight feet deep. The enemy aircraft dropped three bombs, two of which exploded, but none hit the truck. I quickly jumped into the truck and drove away as fast as I could. I had just driven twenty or thirty meters when another bomb exploded. The rear half of the truck was shaken, and dirt collapsed into the cargo bed, but the truck was not damaged.

    The American devils wanted to use aircraft to block our supply lines. That was a pipe dream. Before the Fifth Campaign, I once transported artillery shells across a river. The enemy sent seven or eight aircraft every night to guard the area. No matter how dark it was, we couldn't turn on the lights. So, I had my assistant get into the water to lead the way, and I drove the truck along the riverbed. We had already crossed two-thirds of the way when some trucks behind us turned on their lights, and the enemy aircraft spotted us and dropped four flares, making it brighter than moonlight. I thought it would be even more dangerous to stop, so I kept going! The enemy aircraft fired several bursts of machine gun fire and three artillery shells, but none hit my truck.

    Every time I returned from the front, I would proactively go to the motor vehicle command post to ask if there were any wounded soldiers. When transporting wounded soldiers, I tried my best to drive slowly and find good houses and good air-raid shelters for them to stay in. If they had no rice or vegetables, we would give them our own rice and canned food. Once, while transporting wounded soldiers, we were almost to the hospital when enemy aircraft dropped flares. We carried the wounded soldiers to a safe place.

    I did my best to help other brother automobile units that were in trouble, because if their trucks fell into a ditch or got stuck and were not pulled out, they could be damaged by enemy aircraft, and our motherland's property would be lost. I couldn't just focus on completing my mission and watch the motherland's supplies get damaged. During the four months I spent in Korea, I towed other units' vehicles more than sixty times, including twenty-three times for the Korean People's Army. Many times, I helped them tow the vehicles near dawn, and some of the times it was when enemy aircraft were dropping flares, in an emergency situation.

    I have always taken good care of my vehicle. If there was a small problem, I would repair it. I would inspect it even if it meant not sleeping during the day. If there was something wrong with the truck, it was like having mud smeared on my face. I had to fix it. During the execution of my missions, I always kept in mind the "three firsts" (let others go first, slow down first, stop first). During the execution of my mission in Korea, my vehicle was not involved in any accidents, big or small.

    This time in Korea, I was awarded one Special Merit, two Major Merits, and one Minor Merit, and I was selected to return to the motherland to participate in the National Day celebrations. I feel very honored. (Attached picture)

    安全行车一万六千三百公里
    人民志愿军英雄司机  许景春
    我是中国人民志愿军汽车部队的汽车司机。我主要的工作是把弹药、粮食、物资，从后方运到前方去，把在前方负伤的同志转运到后方来。
    在朝鲜，美国飞机很猖獗，不仅白天开车困难，就是夜里如果被它们发现也要被扫射轰炸。朝鲜的公路本来不宽，再加上美国飞机的破坏，行车真是困难。但是，我们是中国人民志愿军，是不怕困难的。四个多月中，我安全行车一万六千三百公里，车子就没有被打过，我运的物资也一样没有损失过。我时时刻刻记着：车子是从祖国开出来的，物资也是祖国人民送来的。在每次伪装汽车时，我都向老百姓打听敌机活动的情况，并且帮助助手工作；伪装好了，我还要到山坡上去看看是不是会被敌机发现。在道上我更注意，我让助手专听“防空枪”。另外，我还很会记路，跑三次我就记得差不多了，知道那里可以快跑，那里要小心，那里有桥，那里可以伪装……。
    我第一次到铁原执行任务时，走到马场面附近，那里是片平原。敌机飞来了，先扔了两个照明弹，然后低飞扫射轰炸；我闭了火一听，炸弹嗖嗖地下来了，我的助手连忙跳到公路旁的小沟里，接着我也跳进一个七、八尺深的炸弹坑里。敌机扔了三颗炸弹，响了两个，都没打中汽车。我紧忙跳上汽车，把车飞快地开跑了；刚开出二十多公尺，另一颗炸弹也响了，汽车的后半部被震得一颠，泥土崩到车厢里了，可是车子没有受伤。
    美国鬼子想用飞机封锁我们的供应线，那是梦想。在第五次战役前，有一次我拉炮弹过一条河，敌人每夜都出动七、八架飞机在那里看守。不管怎样黑，我们也不能打灯。于是，我就让助手下水里去领路，我开着车顺着路口淌，已经过了三分之二，因为后面有的汽车打了灯，被敌机发现了，就投了四颗照明弹，照得比月亮地里还亮，我看停车危险更大，还是跑吧！敌机扫了几梭子，打了三炮，可是都没打中我的汽车。
    每次从前方回来，我都主动地到汽车指挥所去问有没有伤员。拉伤员时，我尽力走得慢些，找好的房子、好的防空洞给他们住；他们没米、没菜，我们就把自己的米和罐头给他们吃。有次拉伤员，快到医院啦，碰到敌机扔照明弹，我们就把伤员背到安全地方。
    其他兄弟汽车部队有困难，我尽力帮助，因为如果他们的车掉在沟里或陷住，不帮助拉出去，让敌机打坏，还是我们祖国财产受损失；我不能单纯为了完成任务，瞅着祖国的物资受损失。我在朝鲜执行四个多月的任务中，给兄弟部队拉有六十多次车，其中给朝鲜人民军拉了二十三次。许多次是快天亮时帮助拉的，有的还是在敌机投照明弹，情况紧急的时候。
    我对车辆是一贯爱护，有点毛病就修理，白天不睡觉也要检查，汽车有点毛病，就像我的脸上抹了泥似的，非修理好不可。在执行任务中时时刻刻记住“三先”（先让，先慢，先停）；在朝鲜执行任务中，我的车大小事故没出过。
    我这次在朝鲜立了一特功、两大功、一小功，又被选派回到祖国参加国庆观礼，我感到非常光荣。（附图片）
