Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 17th: Farmers in Wushi Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—the hometown of Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander General Peng Dehuai—wrote a letter to Commander Peng to pay their respects and report on the township's anti-American and aid-Korea work over the past year, on the anniversary of the Volunteer Army's departure to fight abroad. The original letter is as follows:

Dear Commander Peng:

You have led the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Korea to help the Korean people fight against the American invading army for nearly a year. Over the past year, you and the Korean People's Army have fought together and achieved brilliant victories, annihilating more than 300,000 enemy troops, shattering the American imperialists' arrogant invasion plan, and making great contributions to the cause of world people striving for lasting peace. We, who grew up in your hometown—Wushi Township—are here to pay our respects and offer our congratulations to you, and to report on our anti-American and aid-Korea work.

Since the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association called for increased production and donations of airplanes and artillery on June 1st of this year, the people of Xiangtan County launched a campaign to donate a "Mao Zedong Hometown" fighter plane. The farmers of Wushi Township immediately and unanimously supported it, and every household included the method of increasing production and making donations in their patriotic covenants. At that time, the people of the whole township planned to donate 11 million yuan. Later, Comrade Chai Chuanruo, a representative of the Volunteer Army returning home, came to our township and reported on your heroic struggle on the front lines in Korea. Our patriotic enthusiasm was even more encouraged, and the donation figure increased to 20 million yuan. Now Wushi Township has basically completed its donation plan.

For the families of martyrs and soldiers who lack labor, the villages in our township have universally organized farming assistance groups, and they have all achieved a good harvest this year. The women in the township have also organized consolation groups to regularly help the families of martyrs and soldiers solve their family difficulties.

Thanks to the land reform, we have turned ourselves around and have our own land. Everyone is farming meticulously, and we have had a good harvest this year. The land in Shaoyao Village and Shilun Village, which used to suffer from insect plagues or droughts every year, has also had a full harvest this year.

In June of this year, after studying current events, the people of the whole township know that American imperialism is a paper tiger and a mad dog. If you don't hit it with a thick stick, it won't stop biting people. Therefore, twenty-six young people from your hometown have joined the Volunteer Army, many of whom are sending their sons and husbands to join the army, and their enthusiasm is very high.

Recently, the American imperialists bombed the Kaesong Neutral Zone, which once again shows that the American bandits have no sincerity for peace, and we are very angry to hear this. Now everyone is starting to revise the patriotic covenants, striving to overfulfill the donation plan, launching autumn and winter production movements, strengthening anti-espionage and eliminating special agents, and preparing to review the land reform, etc., to resolutely support you, until the final victory of the anti-American and aid-Korea effort.

We wish you victorious progress!

    湖南省湘潭县乌石乡农民
    写信向志愿军彭德怀司令员祝贺胜利
    并报告故乡人民一年来的抗美援朝工作
    【新华社长沙十七日电】中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军故乡——湖南省湘潭县乌石乡的农民，在志愿军出国作战周年纪念日前，写信向彭司令员致敬，并报告该乡一年来的抗美援朝工作。原信如下：亲爱的彭司令员：
    你率领中国人民志愿军到朝鲜帮助朝鲜人民打击美国侵略军将近一年了。一年来，你们和朝鲜人民军联合作战，获得了歼敌三十多万人的辉煌胜利，粉碎了美帝国主义狂妄的侵略计划，对世界人民争取持久和平的事业作了伟大的贡献。生长在你的故乡——乌石乡的我们，特在这里向你致敬和道喜，并向你报告我们的抗美援朝工作。
    自今年六月一日中国人民抗美援朝总会号召增产捐献飞机大炮以来，湘潭县人民就发起捐献“毛泽东故乡号”战斗机，乌石乡农民，马上一致拥护，家家户户把增产捐献的办法订入爱国公约。当时全乡人民预定捐献一千一百万元，后来志愿军归国代表柴川若同志来到我乡，报告了你们在朝鲜前线英勇奋斗的功绩，我们的爱国热情，更加被鼓舞起来，捐献数字增加到两千万元。现在乌石乡已经基本上完成了捐献计划。
    对于缺乏劳动力的烈士家属和军人家属，我乡各村普遍组织了代耕组，他们今年都得到了丰收。乡里的妇女又组织了慰问组，经常帮助烈士家属和军人家属解决他们的家庭事务困难。
    由于经过土地改革，我们翻了身，有了自己的土地，大家精耕细作，今年得到了丰收。那芍药村和狮崙村的土地，从前每年不是虫灾，就是旱灾，今年也得到了全收。
    今年六月间，全乡人民经过时事学习，都知道美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，又是一只疯狗，不用粗棍打它，是不会停止咬人的。因此，你故乡有二十六个青年参加了志愿军，其中许多是送子送夫去参军的，情绪都很热烈。
    最近美帝国主义轰炸开城中立区，再一次说明了美国强盗没有和平诚意，我们听了非常愤怒。现在大家正着手修订爱国公约，争取超额完成捐献计划，开展秋、冬两季生产运动，加强防奸肃特，准备复查土地改革等工作，来坚决支援你们，一直到抗美援朝最后胜利为止。敬祝你胜利前进！
            湘潭县乌石乡全体农民十月十五日
    【新华社长沙十七日电】中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军故乡——湖南省湘潭县乌石乡的农民，正以完成爱国捐献计划和修订爱国公约的实际行动，纪念志愿军出国作战一周年。连日来，乌石乡农民已缴纳献款一千五百多万元，占原订计划百分之八十弱，并决定在二十日前全部完成计划。
    十月十四日，乌石乡农民代表召开了纪念志愿军出国作战周年的筹备会。各代表在会上座谈了一年来全乡抗美援朝工作的成绩，一致认为由于经过抗美援朝的爱国教育，鼓舞了农民的爱国热情，全乡今年增产了二十多万斤粮食。各代表并建议检查和修订全乡的爱国公约，克服在少数人中已经滋长起来的松懈思想，继续大力加强抗美援朝工作，来纪念志愿军出国作战一周年。乌石乡人民已从十五日起，分村开展了时事宣传和修订爱国公约的运动，并决定在二十五日举行纪念大会。
