Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch:

    The American people continue to condemn the government's lack of sincerity in the Korean armistice negotiations and demand that the U.S. representatives change their attitude. According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency: The American Communist Party sent an open letter to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson this week, demanding that the United States make sincere efforts to end the Korean War. The letter criticized Ridgway's negotiating representatives for lacking sincerity and stated that the State Department fully supported them. The letter also pointed out that the U.S. representatives' stubborn refusal to cease fire and truce at the 38th parallel was Acheson eating his own words.
    Richardsson and Uphouse, directors of the "American Peace Crusade," also sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Lie on the 18th, representing the "Peace Crusade," denouncing Ridgway's demand on October 16th that the battle line reached by military offensives be the "advanced truce line." The telegram warned that Ridgway's request had "the danger of making negotiations impossible to resume." The telegram asked Lie to "order the United Nations negotiating representatives to insist on an immediate ceasefire to seek peace."
    The leaders of the "American Peace Crusade" also telegraphed Truman, requesting him to order the U.S. negotiating representatives in Korea to agree to an immediate ceasefire first and continue the truce negotiations.
    Zachary, editor and publisher of the New York "Compass Daily," also sharply criticized Ridgway's policy in the newspaper's editorial on October 17th, saying that this policy showed "the resurgence of MacArthurism." Zachary added: "Ridgway must be a commander who strives for a ceasefire, not opposes a ceasefire, otherwise, he must be given the same punishment as MacArthur for the same reasons."

    美国人民要求停战
    谴责美政府在朝鲜谈判中缺乏诚意
     【新华社二十日讯】美国人民继续谴责政府在朝鲜停战谈判中缺乏诚意，并要求美方代表改变态度。据电通社消息：美国共产党本周曾给美国国务卿艾奇逊一封公开信，要求美国进行诚挚的努力以结束朝鲜战争。该信斥责李奇微的谈判代表缺乏诚意，而国务院是完全支持他们的。该信并指出美方代表顽固地拒绝在三八线停火休战是艾奇逊自食前言。
    “美国和平十字军”理事李查逊和厄普豪斯也于十八日代表“和平十字军”致电联合国秘书长赖伊，斥责李奇微十月十六日所提出的以军事攻势所达到的战线为“前进休战线”的要求。电文警告说：李奇微的要求有“使谈判无法恢复的危险”。电文要求赖伊“命令联合国的谈判代表坚持立即停火而求得和平”。
    “美国和平十字军”的领袖还致电杜鲁门，要求他命令美国在朝鲜的谈判代表同意先行立即停火而继续休战谈判。
    纽约“指南针日报”的编辑兼发行人萨克莱，在十月十七日该报的社论中也尖锐地批评李奇微的政策，说这个政策表明了“麦克阿瑟主义的再起”。萨克莱又说：“李奇微必须是努力企求停火、而不是反对停火的司令官，否则，就必需为了同样的理由而给他以和麦克阿瑟同样的处分。”
