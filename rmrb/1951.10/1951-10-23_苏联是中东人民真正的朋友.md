    The people of various Middle Eastern countries, in their movement for independence and autonomy against imperialism, have increasingly recognized a precious truth: that only the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are their true friends in the struggle for independence and liberation.

    On the 21st of this month, the people of Cairo, in an anti-imperialist demonstration, raised the slogan "Establish a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union." On the 20th, Cairo's "Egyptian Gazette" published an editorial advocating the conclusion of a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union. The newspaper pointed out: "The situation in recent days has undeniably shown that Egypt cannot obtain anything from the imperialist countries. The gap between our lowest national hopes and the highest limits stipulated by Western countries is infinitely large. Therefore, we can only turn to a new ally who supports our policies and helps us realize our national aspirations." The newspaper added: "If we do not do so, we will make an unforgivable mistake."

    Similarly, the Soviet Union's strong support for the Iranian people's struggle against imperialism has also been warmly embraced and sincerely appreciated by the Iranian people. Because the Soviet representative spoke out for justice in the Security Council, Iranian parliamentarian Ashitiyani-Zhide stated that "the Iranian people will not forget the Soviet government's wise policy and friendly attitude." Iranian newspapers called the Soviet Union a "protector of weak nations." Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh also expressed his willingness to be friendly with the Soviet Union at the Security Council on October 15th, and he compared the attitudes of the Soviet Union and Britain towards Iran. He said: When the Communist Party seized power from the Tsarist regime after the First World War, it returned all leased territories to Iran, but Britain "was not so generous." On October 20th, the Iranian Foreign Minister officially expressed gratitude for the Soviet Union's just support for Iran in the Security Council during a meeting with the Soviet Ambassador to Iran.

    Obviously, the expressions of friendship with the Soviet Union from Egypt and Iran, which are in the midst of struggle, are by no means accidental. This is because the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Middle Eastern people's struggle for independence and freedom is one of righteous support and friendly concern; the attitude of British and American imperialists towards the Middle Eastern people is one of shameless threats and unreasonable extortion and intimidation. The people of the Middle Eastern countries should draw the correct conclusion from this: they must unite with true friends—the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and the peace-loving people of the world—to jointly oppose the vicious enemies of the people of the Middle Eastern countries and the people of the world—the British and American imperialists.

    Undoubtedly, the Chinese people will, together with the Soviet people, fully support the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the Middle Eastern countries.

### 苏联是中东人民真正的朋友

    苏联是中东人民真正的朋友
    中东各国人民在反对帝国主义的独立自主运动中，已日益认清一条极其宝贵的真理，那就是：只有苏联和人民民主国家才是他们争取独立解放斗争中的真正的朋友。
    本月二十一日开罗人民在反帝示威中就提出了“要与苏联缔结友好条约”的口号。开罗“埃及人报”二十日曾发表社论，主张与苏联缔结友好条约。该报指出：“最近几天的情势已经不容否认地说明，埃及从帝国主义国家方面得不到什么东西。在我们最低的民族希望与西方国家规定的最高限度之间，鸿沟是无限巨大。因此，我们只有转向于一个赞成我们的政策并且帮助我们实现民族愿望的新盟国。”该报并说：“假如我们不这样做，我们便会造成无可饶恕的错误。”
    同样，苏联对伊朗人民反对帝国主义斗争的有力支援，也得到了伊朗人民的热烈拥护与衷心感激。由于苏联代表在安理会上仗义执言，伊朗议员阿希蒂安尼—柴德就曾表示“伊朗人民不会忘记苏联政府的明智的政策和友好的态度”。伊朗报纸称苏联为“弱小国家的保护者”。伊朗首相摩萨台在十月十五日的安理会上也表示愿与苏联友好，他并将苏联和英国对伊朗的态度作了一个对比。他说：共产党在第一次世界大战结束后夺得了沙皇政权的时候，把所有的租借地都交还给伊朗，但是英国“并不是同样慷慨的”。十月二十日，伊朗外长和苏联驻伊朗大使会谈时，正式表示感谢苏联在安理会对伊朗的正义支持。
    显然的，斗争中的埃及与伊朗这种与苏联友好的表示，绝不是偶然的，这是由于苏联对待中东人民争取独立自由的斗争的态度是正义的支持和友谊的关怀；英美帝国主义者对待中东人民的态度却是无耻的威胁和蛮横无理的讹诈与恐吓。中东各国人民应该从此得出正确的结论：必须联合真正的朋友——苏联与人民民主国家及世界爱好和平的人民，来共同反对中东各国人民与世界人民的凶恶的敌人——英美帝国主义者。
    无庸置疑，中国人民将和苏联人民一道，全力支援中东各国人民反帝国主义的斗争。
