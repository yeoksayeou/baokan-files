    The Great Power to Consolidate the Border
    ——An Introduction to the Development of the Patriotic Public Agreement Movement in Yunnan
    By our special correspondent Yuan Bo
    The patriotic public agreement movement of people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Yunnan Province has made great progress in conjunction with the implementation of various central tasks. The patriotic public agreement has stimulated and consolidated the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups, promoted various construction tasks, and rapidly renewed the appearance of the motherland's border areas.
    Yunnan is one of the outposts of national defense in Southwest China, bordering Vietnam, Myanmar and other countries along more than 2,500 kilometers of national border. Of the 15 million people in the province, more than 60 percent are various ethnic minorities; the feudal forces in the countryside are quite strong. After liberation, the Kuomintang remnants who roamed inside and outside the territory under the instigation of imperialism, colluded with the anti-revolutionary remnants and feudal forces lurking inside the territory, provoked ethnic sentiments, and created bandit riots, which seriously endangered the interests of the people of all ethnic groups and hindered various construction tasks.
    The patriotic education of the past year has greatly enhanced the political awareness of the people of all ethnic groups and rapidly changed this situation. Over the past year, the people of all ethnic groups have assisted the People's Liberation Army in annihilating more than 80,000 bandits and guerrillas manufactured by the US-Chiang clique, basically eliminating the main bandits in the heartland; in more than 80 counties in two-thirds of the province, a mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and reduce rent and return deposits has been launched. The deepening of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea has greatly promoted these central tasks. The patriotic public agreement movement has become a great force for consolidating the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups and promoting central tasks.
    In February of this year, the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan launched a movement to sign patriotic public agreements in the patriotic movements celebrating the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid and opposing the rearmament of Japan by the United States. This movement has been further developed through the popularization of patriotic education in April and the "May Day" demonstration. Since June, people of all ethnic groups throughout the province have successively responded to the three major patriotic calls of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. After the reporting of the returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Yunnan working team of the Chinese People's Mission to Korea, the patriotic public agreement movement of all ethnic groups in Yunnan has been given a strong impetus. Over the past eight months, it has developed from central cities to remote rural areas, from one region and one class to a grassroots unit, and from a general expression of political attitude to an increasingly close combination with central tasks, and the specific content of realizing the three major patriotic calls has been incorporated into the patriotic public agreement.
    The patriotic public agreement movement connects the specific struggle tasks of the people of all ethnic groups in the central work at that time and place with the overall political task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and greatly exerted the enthusiasm of each individual. The Kunming Electrical Equipment Factory promoted the rationalization proposal movement in realizing the three major patriotic calls. In the month after the report of the returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the workers put forward 49 rationalization proposals, of which 90 percent were adopted, and one billion yuan of wealth can be saved for the country within one year. As the result of the workers of the Kaiyuan Power Plant machine room, which is an important power plant of Gejiu Tin Mine, implementing the patriotic public agreement, responsibility accidents have been basically eliminated and the safety of power generation has been ensured. Other factories and mines have also improved production in the implementation of the patriotic public agreement.
    The peasants incorporated the content of the anti-feudal struggle into the patriotic public agreement, so that the task of the anti-feudal struggle was implemented in every household and every person, and the work of reducing rent and returning deposits and clearing up counter-revolutionary cases could be developed smoothly. Farmers in the Sixth District of Chuxiong County initiated a movement to search the mountains for bandits in order to implement the patriotic public agreement. Farmers' representatives from the whole district formed many groups, went out to learn about the situation of bandit roaming, and captured many fugitive bandit leaders. The movement of the patriotic public agreement not only promoted the anti-feudal struggle, but also educated the peasants that in order to protect the fruits of victory, it is necessary to increase production, support the front, and consolidate the people's motherland. The family patriotic public agreements of the peasants have all made specific plans for patriotic prosperity, increasing production and donating. After the patriotic public agreement inspection movement in July and August, the production increase movement of the people in Jinning and other counties has made great achievements. According to the statistics after the inspection and revision of the patriotic public agreement in July and August in the county: this year, the county can increase the production of 1,519,875 jin of rice and 14,264 jin of flue-cured tobacco; of which 383,548 jin of rice and 785 jin of flue-cured tobacco can be donated, and a part of the income from the increase in sideline business, totaling 12,770,980 yuan in RMB. The specific conditions for the increase in production in the county are: the fields have been weeded once more than last year; each mu of land has been fertilized with 4 to 15 loads of ash or manure more than in previous years; flood prevention organizations have been established in each township and village to patrol the water situation at any time; the insecure river embankments have been rebuilt and various flood prevention equipment has been prepared. Therefore, by the end of August, not a mu of land in the county was flooded (1,300 mu were flooded last year). The patriotic public agreements of all districts, townships, villages and households in the county ensure the realization of these specific production increase conditions.
    On the vast national border, the patriotic public agreement movement has strengthened the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the struggle to defend the border. The Lisu people of Liwudi Village, Bijang County, outside Gaoligong Mountain (491 of the 497 people in the village are Christians), after more than five months of education in the Three-Self Reform Movement, realized the conspiracy of imperialism to use religion to carry out aggressive activities. In June of this year, the people of the whole village signed a patriotic public agreement and broke with imperialism. As early as 1928, imperialist elements put on the religious cloak to carry out aggressive activities among the people of this village, which were all exposed and went bankrupt this time. In the undetermined border area between China and Myanmar in northwestern Yunnan and in the Honghe River Basin in southern Yunnan, it was found that imperialist elements from outside the territory either wrote letters or sent money, using petty favors to deceive the people of ethnic minorities in the border areas, but they were all rejected by them. Now, the people in some border areas have been organized under the form of "Patriotic Home Guard Joint Defense Public Agreement," standing guard, patrolling, checking pedestrians, transporting the wounded, cooperating with the People's Liberation Army, and guarding the border defense. They said: If imperialism dares to invade the motherland from the border, it will be called to bump its head and shed blood. Yang Yingming, a 62-year-old Lisu farmer from Jietou, Tengchong, who once organized a mountain search team and continuously captured nine bandits, now carries a lantern every night and patrols the rugged mountain road with the rifle awarded to him by the People's Government. He said: "This place is very important, and bandits often sneak in from here. From now on, they will not be allowed to sneak in, catch one when they come, and catch a pair when they come two!"
    In the areas where the patriotic public agreement movement has been carried out conscientiously, the people of all ethnic groups have recognized the importance of the patriotic public agreement from actual struggles and have turned the patriotic public agreement into their own program of action. The masses said: "After signing the patriotic public agreement, everyone will do it according to it, and production will be more energetic, and everything will be done well." "With the patriotic public agreement, you will not go on the dark road." However, the development of Yunnan's patriotic public agreement movement is not balanced enough. At present, the province can be roughly divided into three types of areas: one is the advanced area where the patriotic public agreement movement has penetrated into grassroots units, into families, closely combined with the central work and promoted the central work, and the number is small. Before "May Day" this year, these areas conscientiously popularized patriotic education in conjunction with the central work, and after "May Day," they further developed the patriotic public agreement movement, making this movement popular to every household and every person. The leading cadres in these areas attach great importance to the leadership of the patriotic public agreement movement, which not only improves the awareness of the masses, but also trains a large number of backbones and gains experience. Jinning, Simao and other counties are such areas. Their experience, after serious promotion, has attracted the attention of all parts of the province, and all parts of the province are learning from them, and this type of area is rapidly expanding. The second is the area where the patriotic public agreement movement has not been pushed to the grassroots units and every family, and has not been well combined with the central work. This type of area accounts for a large number. In this type of area, many cadres have insufficient understanding of the political significance of the patriotic public agreement movement for a long time, and oppose the patriotic education of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to the masses and various central tasks. Thinking that "I am engaged in production and factory democratic reform," or "I am engaged in reducing rent and returning deposits," "regardless of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea," regarding the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea as an "extra burden." Many patriotic public agreements are signed by a few cadres, some are signed by cadres first, and then the masses are asked to raise their hands to pass them. Others are launched by "challenge competition" without sufficient ideological mobilization, and lack an inspection system. The masses do not understand why they signed the patriotic public agreement, and they cannot remember their own patriotic public agreement; therefore, it is over after signing it. The masses said: "The patriotic public agreement was signed by the top, and we can't remember it." The third is some blank areas that still exist in some marginal areas and mountainous areas in the heartland. Due to various subjective and objective reasons, work has not been systematically carried out in these areas, so patriotic education has not been well popularized.
    Now the patriotic public agreement movement in various parts of Yunnan is further popularizing and deepening, and is currently working towards expanding advanced areas and eliminating blank areas, so that the people of all ethnic groups can further strengthen unity under the banner of patriotism and consolidate the border of the motherland.

    巩固边疆的巨大力量
    ——云南爱国公约运动发展概况介绍
    本报特约记者  袁勃
    云南省各族各界人民的爱国公约运动，结合各种中心工作的进行，有了很大的发展。爱国公约激发、巩固了各民族人民的爱国热情，推动了各种建设工作，使祖国边疆的面貌迅速为之一新。
    云南是西南国防前哨之一，在两千五百多公里的国境线上接连着越南、缅甸等国家。省区一千五百万人口中，有百分之六十以上是各种少数民族；农村的封建势力相当强大。解放以后，帝国主义指使流窜境内外的国民党残匪，勾结潜伏境内的反革命残余及封建势力，挑拨民族感情，制造土匪暴乱，相当严重地危害了各族人民的利益，并障碍了各种建设工作。
    一年来的爱国主义教育，大大地提高了各族人民的政治觉悟，迅速改变了这种情况。各族人民协助人民解放军一年来歼灭美蒋一手制造的土匪游击队八万多人，基本上消灭了腹心地区的整股土匪；在全省占三分之二地区的八十多个县份，开展了镇压反革命和减租、退押的群众运动。抗美援朝爱国运动的日益深入，大大地推动了这些中心工作。爱国公约运动成为巩固各族人民爱国热情和推动中心工作的伟大力量。
    今年二月，云南各族人民在庆祝中苏缔结友好同盟互助条约一周年和反对美国重新武装日本的爱国运动中，展开了订立爱国公约运动。这一运动，经过四月份的普及爱国主义教育，“五一”示威，有了进一步的发展。六月以后，全省各地各族人民相继响应抗美援朝总会三大爱国号召。经过中国人民志愿军归国代表，中国人民赴朝慰问团云南工作队的传达报告，对云南各族人民的爱国公约运动给予了有力的推动。八个月来，它从中心城市发展到边远农村，从一个地域，一个阶层深入到一个基层单位，从一般的政治上的表示态度发展到日益密切地结合中心工作，并把实现三大爱国号召的具体内容订入爱国公约。
    爱国公约运动把各族人民在当时当地的中心工作中的具体斗争任务同抗美援朝的总政治任务联系起来，极大地发挥了每一个人的积极性。昆明电工器材厂在实现三大爱国号召中推动了合理化建议运动，在中国人民志愿军归国代表报告后的一个月当中，工人提出了四十九件合理化建议，其中百分之九十均被采用，在一年之内可为国家节省一亿元的财富。做为个旧锡矿重要动力工厂的开远发电厂机房工人实践爱国公约的结果，基本消灭了责任事故，保证了发电的安全。其他各厂矿也都在执行爱国公约中提高了生产。
    农民们把反封建斗争的内容订入了爱国公约，使反封建的斗争任务贯彻到每一户每一人中去，使减租退押清理反革命积案的工作都得以顺利发展。楚雄县六区农民为执行爱国公约发起搜山捉匪运动。全区农民代表组成了许多小组，四出了解土匪流窜情况，捉住了不少漏网匪首。爱国公约的运动不仅推动了反封建斗争，而且教育了农民：要保卫胜利果实，必须增加生产，支援前线，巩固人民祖国。农民的家庭爱国公约都订出了爱国发家、增产捐献的具体计划。经过七、八两月份的爱国公约检查运动，晋宁等县人民的增产运动已经做出了很大的成绩。据该县七、八两月份检查、修订爱国公约后的统计：今年全县可增产稻谷一百五十一万九千八百七十五斤，烤烟一万四千二百六十四斤；其中可捐献稻谷三十八万三千五百四十八斤，烤烟七百八十五斤，另捐献经营副业增加的收入一部，计人民币一千二百七十七万零九百八十元。该县增产的具体条件是：田里都比去年多拔了一次草；每亩田比往年多施了四至十五挑灰或粪；每个乡、村都建立了防洪组织，随时巡查水情；不坚固的河堤都已重新修筑，并准备了各种防洪用具。因此，到八月底为止，全县没有一亩田被淹（去年淹了一千三百多亩）。全县各区、各乡、各村、各户的爱国公约，保证了这些具体增产条件的实现。
    在辽阔的国境线上，爱国公约运动加强了各族人民的团结和保卫边疆的斗争。高黎贡山外碧江县理误底村傈僳族人民（全村四百九十七人中有四百九十一人是基督教徒），经过了五个多月的三自革新运动的教育，认识了帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略活动的阴谋。今年六月全村人民订了爱国公约，和帝国主义一刀两断。远自一九二八年，帝国主义分子就披着宗教外衣在这村人民中间进行侵略活动，此次被全部揭穿，一齐破产。在滇西北的中缅未定界地带，以及滇南的红河流域，都曾发现有境外的帝国主义分子或写信、或送钱，用小恩小惠来骗取边境少数民族人民，但都被他们拒绝了。现在部分边疆地区的人民已经在“爱国保家联防公约”的形式之下组织起来，站岗放哨，盘查行人，运送伤员，配合人民解放军，守卫边防。他们表示：如果帝国主义敢从边疆侵犯祖国，就叫它碰得头破血流。曾经组织搜山小组，连续捉住九个土匪的腾冲界头六十二岁傈僳族农民杨应明，现在每晚提着灯笼，背着人民政府奖给他的步枪，在崎岖的山道上巡逻。他说：“这地方非常重要，土匪老从这里窜进来。以后管叫他们溜进来的一个也跑不了，来一个捉一个，来两个捉一对！”
    在认真地开展了爱国公约运动的地区，各族人民从实际斗争中认识了爱国公约的重要意义，并把爱国公约变成了自己的行动纲领。群众说：“订了爱国公约，大家照着去做，生产也起劲，事事都搞得好。”“有了爱国公约就不会走黑路了。”但是，云南的爱国公约运动的发展，还是不够平衡的。目前，在全省范围内大体可以分成三种地区：一种是爱国公约运动已经深入基层单位，深入家庭，密切结合了中心工作并推动了中心工作的先进地区，数量较少。这些地区，今年“五一”以前就结合中心工作认真普及了爱国主义教育，“五一”以后又深入发展了爱国公约运动，使这一运动普及到每一户每一人。这些地区的领导干部十分重视对爱国公约运动的领导，在运动中不仅提高了群众觉悟，而且训练了大批骨干，取得了经验。晋宁、思茅等县就是这一类地区。他们的经验，经过认真推广，已引起全省各地注意，各地都在向他们学习，这类地区正在迅速扩大。其次是爱国公约运动还没有推向基层单位与每一家庭，没有和中心工作很好地结合的地区。这一类地区所占数量较大。在这类地区，很多干部对于爱国公约运动的政治意义曾在很长时间内认识不足，把向群众进行抗美援朝爱国主义教育，和各种中心工作对立起来。认为“我是搞生产、搞工厂民主改革”的，或者“我是搞减租退押的”，“不管抗美援朝”，把抗美援朝运动看做是“额外负担”。许多爱国公约是由少数几个干部包办订立的，有的是干部先订好几条，然后让群众举手通过的。还有的是没经过充分思想发动，就用“挑战竞赛”搞起来的，而且缺乏检查制度。群众并不懂得为什么订爱国公约，也记不得自己的爱国公约；因此，订完了也就完了事。群众说：“爱国公约是上头订的，我们记不得了。”第三种是在部分边沿地区和腹心地区的山地还存在着的一些空白区，这类地区由于主客观各方面的原因，工作还没有系统地开展，因此爱国主义教育也没有很好地普及。
    现在云南各地的爱国公约运动正进一步地普及与深入，目前正向扩大先进区、消灭空白区的方向努力，使各族人民在爱国主义的旗帜下进一步加强团结，巩固祖国的边疆。
