    International Short Commentary
    Protest Against the British Army's Atrocities in Egypt
    Britain, and the American imperialism behind it, have adopted an extremely arrogant and shameless attitude towards Egypt's decision to abolish the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the Egyptian people's movement for independence and autonomy. On the 16th of this month, the British troops stationed in the Suez Canal Zone of Egypt opened fire on Egyptian people who were holding demonstrations, causing more than a hundred casualties among the Egyptian people.
    This atrocity by the British army will surely arouse great anger among the Egyptian people and all justice- and peace-loving people around the world. Generally speaking, the days when imperialism can act lawlessly and run rampant in the world no longer exist. The British imperialism's violence against the Egyptian people will surely be met with just punishment.
    The reason why the British troops stationed in Egypt are so tyrannical and dare to act violently against the Egyptian people is by no means accidental. They still obviously regard themselves as the masters of Egypt and treat the Egyptian people as slaves who can be manipulated at will. British Foreign Secretary Morrison has stated more than once that he would use force to deal with the Egyptian people; the British Commander-in-Chief in Egypt even openly broadcasted on his military radio, "ordering his troops to fiercely resist (meaning slaughter), 'if the Egyptians try to force the British to leave Egypt.'" (Associated Press) What reason and right does the British army have to occupy Egypt? Obviously, there is no reason, and no one gives them this right. They ignore the opposition of the Egyptian people and put on the face of imperialists, forcibly occupying Egypt, only to continue to enslave and exploit the Egyptian people, and to use Egypt as its military base and colony.
    This is intolerable to the Egyptian people. They have long shouted the slogan "British get out of Egypt" and have taken action to realize this slogan. This force is irresistible. The atrocities of the British army can only show the tyranny and panic of the imperialists. It cannot stop the Egyptian people's movement for independence and autonomy.
    The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people and strongly protest against the British imperialists' atrocities of slaughtering the Egyptian people.
            Aggressors Isolated and Helpless
    The United States is encountering more and more difficulties in its war of aggression against Korea. For example, due to the heavy casualties of American soldiers, the aggressors have had to rack their "brains" and seek help everywhere for the blood transfusion problem.
    According to a TASS New York dispatch, because the American people are unwilling to respond to the "urgent call" of the American military authorities to donate their blood, the government authorities of several states have decided to try to get blood from prisoners. "Prisoners can be released as long as they donate no less than one pint (about 500 cc) of blood." At the same time, according to a report by the Dentsu News Agency, in Japan, the American occupation authorities are also forcing the Japanese people to organize a movement to provide blood transfusions for the American troops invading Korea.
    Obviously, the American aggressors will not be able to gather much blood by relying on this desperate method, because even if prisoners are willing to "donate" blood in exchange for "release," they are limited. As for Japan, the forced blood transfusion "movement" will only arouse greater hatred among the Japanese people, and the American occupiers will not get any blood. Moreover, the casualties of the United States on the Korean battlefield are becoming more and more severe. According to recent reports, in the incomplete statistics from October 1st to 10th alone, the American and its vassal troops were wiped out by more than 25,400 on the western front of the Korean battlefield, and in the central front, 17,000 were killed or wounded in the three days from October 13th to 15th. Such an increasing number of huge casualties not only makes the blood transfusion problem of the American aggressor army more difficult, but also makes it more difficult for the United States to collect cannon fodder.
    Since no one is willing to donate blood, would anyone be willing to be cannon fodder? The isolation and helplessness of the aggressors is becoming more and more obvious.

    国际简评
    抗议英国军队在埃及的暴行
    英国及其背后的支持者美国帝国主义，对于埃及废除一九三六年英埃条约的决定及埃及人民要求独立自主的运动，采取了极为蛮横无耻的态度。本月十六日，驻在埃及苏彝士运河区的英国军队，竟然向举行游行示威的埃及人民开枪，埃及人民因而遭受伤亡的达百余人。
    英国军队的这一暴行，必将激起埃及人民与全世界爱好正义和平的人民的重大愤怒；整个说来，帝国主义在世界上可以无法无天、横行霸道的日子已经不存在了，英国帝国主义对埃及人民这样强暴，必将尝受到正义的惩处。
    英国驻在埃及的军队之所以如此横蛮，敢于向埃及人民逞凶，绝不是偶然的。他们显然还自以为是埃及的主人，把埃及人民当作可以任意摆布的奴隶看待。英国外交大臣莫里逊就曾不止一次地声言要以武力对付埃及人民；英国驻埃及军总司令更是公开地在其军中电台广播，“吩咐其军队进行猛烈抵抗（意即屠杀），‘如果埃及人企图强迫英国人离开埃及的话’。”（合众社）英国军队什么理由和权利必须要侵占埃及呢？显然是没有任何理由的，也没有任何人给他们这种权利。他们不顾埃及人民的反对而摆出帝国主义者的面目，强要侵占埃及，只是为了要继续奴役与剥削埃及人民，把埃及当作它的军事基地与殖民地而已。
    这是埃及人民所不能容忍的，他们早已喊出了“英国人滚出埃及”的口号，并且为了实现这个口号而行动起来了，这种力量是不可抗拒的。英国军队的暴行只能说明帝国主义者的横暴与慌张，它绝不能阻止埃及人民争取独立自主的运动。
    中国人民完全支持埃及人民的正义斗争，并对英国帝国主义屠杀埃及人民的暴行提出严重的抗议。
            侵略者孤立无援
    美国在侵略朝鲜战争中所遇到的困难是越来越多了，例如由于美国士兵的伤亡惨重，以至于使侵略者为输血问题也不得不费尽“苦心”，到处张罗。
    据塔斯社纽约电讯的报道，因为美国人民不肯响应美国军事当局的“迫切呼吁”而捐出自己的血液，有几个州的政府当局已决定在犯人身上打主意。“犯人们只要能捐出不低于一品脱（约五百西西）的血液，就可以被开释。”同时，又据电通社的报道，在日本，美国占领当局也正在强迫日本人民组织为侵朝美军输血的运动。
    显然的，美国侵略者依靠这种绝望的办法是张罗不出多少血液的，因为犯人即使肯于“捐”血来换取“开释”，到底是有限的。至于在日本，强迫输血“运动”，只有激起日本人民更大的仇恨，美国占领者是不会得到什么血液的。况且，美国在朝鲜战场上的伤亡越来越惨重，据最近的报道，仅十月一日到十日的不完全统计，美国及其附庸军队在朝鲜战场上的西线即被歼达两万五千四百余名，在中线，由十月十三日到十五日的三天中，又被杀伤一万七千名。这样日益增加的巨大伤亡，就不仅使美国侵略军的输血问题更费张罗，而且还使美国搜罗炮灰更加困难。
    既然没有人肯输血，难道会有人肯当炮灰吗？侵略者的孤立无援是越来越明显了。
