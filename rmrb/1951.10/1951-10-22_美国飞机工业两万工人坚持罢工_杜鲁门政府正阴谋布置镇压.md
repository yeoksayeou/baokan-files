Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: According to a TASS report from New York on the 14th, the strike workers in the American aircraft industry are resolutely defending their demands for increased wages, causing anxiety to the American government. The U.S. government, worried that the strike will disrupt the production of military supplies necessary for the Korean War, is conspiring to suppress it.

    The strike of 10,000 workers at the "Douglas Aircraft Company" in California, which began on September 5, has persisted to this day. This company manufactures "C-124" transport planes. The strike at the "Wright Aeronautical Corporation" in New Jersey, which manufactures jet aircraft engines and began on September 26, includes nearly 10,000 workers and has also persisted into its third week.

    According to newspaper reports, Truman has ordered the Wage Stabilization Board to conduct an investigation. In an attachment to his official letter to the Director of the Wage Stabilization Board, Truman accused the "Wright Aeronautical Corporation" workers' strike of "seriously damaging the defense program" because "even before the strike, the supply of aircraft engines was already behind schedule." He also denounced the strike by workers at the "Douglas Aircraft Company" factories, saying: "The Air Force has no other aircraft that can replace these transport planes. Due to the reduction in production, the Air Force's operations have already been reduced. If the strike continues for a longer period, it will mean the loss of more aircraft, which will cause the Air Force to suffer huge losses." Truman's action is clearly preparing public opinion in advance in order to place all the blame on the workers and adopt direct suppression to suppress the strike.

### 美国飞机工业两万工人坚持罢工  杜鲁门政府正阴谋布置镇压

    美国飞机工业两万工人坚持罢工
    杜鲁门政府正阴谋布置镇压
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约十四日讯：美国飞机工业的罢工工人坚决捍卫他们增加工资的要求，使美国政府感到焦虑。美国政府担心罢工会破坏为进行朝鲜战争所必需的军用品的生产，正阴谋布置镇压。
    从九月五日开始的加利福尼亚州“道格拉斯飞机公司”一万名工人的罢工。一直坚持到现在。该公司是制造“C一二四”型运输机的。新泽西州制造喷气飞机发动机的“莱特航空公司”的工人在九月二十六日开始的罢工，包括近万工人，也已坚持至第三周。
    据报纸消息，杜鲁门已命令工资稳定委员会进行调查。杜鲁门在致工资稳定委员会主任的公文附件中指责“莱特航空公司”工人的罢工“使国防计划遭受严重的损害”，因为“还在没有罢工以前，飞机发动机的供应就已落后于原定计划”。他又斥责“道格拉斯飞机公司”各厂工人的罢工说：“空军没有可以代替这些运输机的其他飞机。由于生产减缩，现在已经使空军的活动减少。如果罢工继续延长，那将意味着丧失更多的飞机，这便会使空军蒙受巨大的损失。”杜鲁门这一行动显然是在预先准备舆论，以便把一切罪过都推在工人身上，采取直接的镇压来压制罢工。
