    Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau Conducts Systematic Inspections
    Promotes Safety and Health Improvements in Factories and Mines
    Chengzi Coal Mine Creates Record of Eight Months Without Serious Injury or Death Underground

    The Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau's efforts to guide factories and mines in improving safety and health have achieved results and yielded some experience through exploration.

    Initially, the Labor Bureau adopted a handicraft approach, sending people to factories one by one to inspect safety and health, but the results were not significant. In the summer of this year, it changed to promoting inspections by industries, finding typical examples, holding collective reporting sessions, and mutual observation to promote overall progress. At the same time, it mobilized the masses of workers to participate in improving safety and health, offering opinions, and devising solutions. In private enterprises, issues were resolved through labor-management consultation meetings. After adopting this working method, both work efficiency and practical gains have greatly improved.

    The main achievements from the factory and mine inspections conducted this summer, excluding the machine dyeing, machine paper-making, and leather-making industries, which had more problems, and focusing on re-inspecting over a dozen larger state-owned factories and mines, are as follows:

    First, enterprise administrations or capitalists have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of safety and health, and have partially reversed the erroneous thinking of "valuing machines over people" and "only talking about production and ignoring safety and health." They have initially recognized that strengthening safety and health work is an important link in doing a good job in production. For example, administrative cadres in Beijing Clothing Factory, Chengzi Coal Mine, and others no longer emphasized the urgency of production tasks or the difficulty of economic conditions as reasons for not actively carrying out safety and health work, but instead requested the Labor Bureau to send people to the factory to help improve work. In the private sector, some capitalists have also dispelled their concerns and are no longer observing state-owned factories but are striving to improve safety and health. For example, the Zhonghua Chang Electroplating Factory previously had excessively long working hours and very poor working conditions. The capitalists did not pay attention to safety and health, and the workers' production morale was low. After inspection, the capitalists' erroneous ideas were criticized, and through labor-management consultation meetings, working hours were reduced from eighteen hours to twelve hours (including meals), and safety and health equipment was improved. This greatly boosted the workers' production enthusiasm, and output not only did not decrease due to the shortening of working hours but increased by 50.28 percent. This fact itself provided the capitalists with a good and vivid education.

    Second, significant improvements have been made in safety and health equipment. In terms of safety, most factory buildings have added guards or railings to gears, grinding wheels, belt pulleys, and electrical switches, and have protective equipment such as gloves, rubber shoes, masks, and aprons. Fire-fighting equipment has been purchased, fire brigades have been established, and new electrical wires have been installed. In terms of hygiene, ventilation equipment has been improved, workshop temperatures have been lowered, and mosquito screens and doors have been installed in dormitories, and gauze boxes and covers have been provided in kitchens, and toilet squatting pits have been covered. Environmental sanitation has also been greatly improved. One factory cleared 204 cartloads of old garbage and rebuilt hidden drainage ditches. More importantly, in the past, the gears of the cloth dyeing tanks in machine dyeing factories were exposed, frequently causing injuries. Each factory stated that there was no solution, but this time, mobilizing the workers of Cihua Dyeing Factory to study the issue finally solved the problem and created a protective tool.

    Third, security organizations and safety systems have been established. Some factories have established maintenance systems for machines and boilers. Chengzi Coal Mine has established a shift handover signing system, creating a record of eight months without serious injury or death accidents underground. Beijing General Machinery Factory and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have established technical safety sections and safety inspectors, formulated inspection systems and work plans, and greatly reduced casualties.

    After improving safety and health, many workers were deeply moved by the government's concern for workers' safety and health. Hu Jinkui, a worker at Cihua Dyeing Factory, said: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the government take such good care of us workers." Production morale has therefore soared, and labor-management unity in private enterprises has been further strengthened.

    北京市劳动局进行系统检查
    推动各厂矿改进安全卫生工作
    城子煤矿创造井下八个月无重伤无死亡事故的纪录
    北京市劳动局领导各工矿改进安全卫生的工作，已获得成绩，并从摸索中获得一些经验。
    最初，劳动局是采取手工业的方式，一个厂子一个厂子地派人下厂检查安全卫生，结果收效不大。在今年夏季，改按产业领导系统推动各厂进行检查，找出典型，集体汇报，互相观摩，以推动全面。同时发动工人群众参加改进安全卫生的工作，提意见，想办法。在私营企业中，就通过劳资协商会议来协商解决。采用这样工作方式后，在工作效率和实际收获上，都大大提高了一步。
    今年夏季所检查的工矿企业，除去有问题较多的机器漂染、机器造纸和制革三个行业外，还重点复查了十几个较大的公营厂矿。经过检查，取得的主要成绩有下面几项：
    第一、企业行政或资方，对安全卫生的重要性，有了进一步的认识，部分地扭转了“重机器不重人”、“只谈生产、不管安全卫生”的错误思想。他们初步认识到：加强安全卫生工作是搞好生产的重要环节。像北京被服厂、城子煤矿等行政干部，不但不再强调生产任务紧急，经济有困难，不积极进行安全卫生工作，而是要求劳动局派人下厂，帮助改进工作。在私营行业里，有些资方也消除顾虑，不再观望公营工厂，而努力改进安全卫生。如中华昶电镀工厂，原来工时过长，劳动条件很坏，资方不重视安全卫生，工人生产情绪低。经过检查后，资方的错误想法受到批判，通过劳资协商会议，将工时由十八小时缩短为十二小时（包括吃饭在内），并改善了安全卫生设备。因此大大鼓舞了工人生产积极性，产量不但没有因为工时缩短而降低，反提高了百分之五○·二八。这个事实本身，给了资本家一个很好的活的教育。
    第二、安全卫生设备已有重大改进。在安全方面，大部分工厂厂房的齿轮、砂轮、皮带轮、电闸等，都加设了外罩或栏杆，有了手套、胶鞋、口罩、围裙等防护设备，并购置防火用具，成立消防队，改装新电线。在卫生方面，改善了通风设备，减低了车间温度，还做到了宿舍按上纱窗、纱门，厨房有纱箱、纱罩，厕所蹲坑加盖。环境卫生也大有改进，有一个工厂清除了远年垃圾二○四车，改设暗水沟。更重要的一项收获是：过去机器漂染工厂的染布槽齿轮都是外露的，经常绞伤人，各厂都表示无法可想，这次发动慈华染厂工人研究，终于解决了这个问题，制造出防护工具。
    第三、建立保安组织和安全制度。有些工厂建立了机器、锅炉的检修制。城子煤矿建立交接班签字制，创造了井下八个月无重伤、无死亡事故的纪录。北京机器总厂、石景山钢铁厂设立了技术安全股和安全检查员，制定了检查制度和工作计划，伤亡事故大大减少。
    改善了安全卫生后，许多工人对政府关心工人安全健康，非常感动。慈华染厂工人胡金奎说：“只有在共产党领导下，政府才能这样照顾我们工人。”生产情绪都因而高涨，私营企业的劳资团结，也因而进一步加强了。（北京市劳动局陈机）
