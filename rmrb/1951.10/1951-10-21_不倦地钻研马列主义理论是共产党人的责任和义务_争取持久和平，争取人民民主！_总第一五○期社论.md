    Tirelessly Studying Marxist-Leninist Theory is the Responsibility and Obligation of Communists
     – Editorial from "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Total No. 150
    The strength and invincibility of communist and workers' parties in all countries lie in the fact that all their work, their strategies, and tactics, are guided by the great Marxist-Leninist theory. Marxist-Leninist theory scientifically reveals the laws of social development and points out how to apply these laws to guide the revolutionary struggle of the working class.

    Comrade Stalin taught that "Marxism is the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of revolution by the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, the science of building a communist society." This science enables communist and workers' parties to find the correct direction in specific situations, to understand the internal connections of events and foresee the course of things, to see not only how events are currently developing and in what direction, but also how they will develop and in what direction in the future.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out that only a party that has mastered Marxist-Leninist theory can advance and confidently lead the working class. Lenin taught us, "Only a party guided by the most advanced theory can fulfill the role of vanguard."

    Every day, new things prove the vigorous vitality of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Marxism-Leninism is concretely manifested in the great achievements of the Soviet people, the political and economic victories of People's China, the success of people's democratic countries in socialist construction, the struggle of the people in capitalist and colonial countries to smash the shackles of imperialism, and the continuous strengthening of the international peace, democracy, and socialism camp.

    As the ideological, political, and organizational work of communist and workers' parties becomes more complex day by day, and as the political activity of the masses grows unprecedentedly, the demands on party leaders and every communist also become higher. They must understand Marxist-Leninist theory and be able to apply this theory to solve various problems in practical work. To have this ability, communists must tirelessly improve their ideological and theoretical level. The results of party education in the past academic year, summarized by various people's democratic countries, prove that the party's education work has greatly improved, and the number of party members and non-party people studying Marxist-Leninist theory has greatly increased. In the People's Republic of China, in various people's democratic countries, and in the German Democratic Republic, the glorious works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are published and sold in millions of copies. The most widely sold book in all countries is the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." This book is a Stalinist encyclopedia of basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, and an inexhaustible source of political experience and political wisdom.

    People's democratic countries are following the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and implementing a unified academic year system in the party education system, regarding it as an important part of party work. Hundreds of thousands of communists have been trained in central and state party schools, in Marxist-Leninist night universities, in study classes for party activists in urban and rural areas, and in lecture classes on the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" and biographies of Lenin and Stalin. Party members who study Marxist-Leninist theory on their own have received help from party tutoring stations and from lectures and discussion meetings. The composition and level of instructors have improved significantly.

    Although communist parties in capitalist and colonial countries are working under difficult conditions of police persecution and fascist provocation, they are becoming increasingly concerned about the ideological education and revolutionary training of their members. The issue of raising the ideological level of all party members was the focus of discussion at the Seventh Congress of the Italian Communist Party. Hundreds of thousands of Italian communists are studying in central and local party schools, in short-term Stalin training classes, and in Gramsci training classes. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party has repeatedly warned all its members that the tasks of fighting for peace, for working-class unity, and for French independence are increasing day by day, and this situation requires communists to have a higher ideological level. In France, in addition to running central and provincial party schools for party cadres, many district party schools have also been organized, in which thousands of party members are studying. These countries are holding lectures to explain the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of the origin and nature of imperialist wars, the possibility of coexistence between the socialist and capitalist systems, and the role of the Soviet Union as a bastion of peace, democracy, and socialism. These reports are also printed and distributed.

    Communist parties in Latin America, the Near East, and other countries are working under difficult conditions of terror and persecution, and they are now also raising the ideological level of their members. Overcoming enormous difficulties, the communist parties in these countries publish and distribute classic works of Marxism-Leninism, party newspapers and periodicals, pamphlets, and leaflets.

    As the new academic year of the party education system begins, communist and workers' parties in people's democratic countries are striving to overcome their shortcomings in the political education of party members, improve the content of political education, improve the quality and ideological level of various training classes, lecture classes, and tutoring stations, instill a spirit of combat into party education, combine education with the practical work of building socialism, and give instructors comprehensive theoretical and methodological assistance. Because in the past, as newspapers in people's democratic countries pointed out, the study of party education in various departments was conducted on a basis of low ideological and political levels, it is particularly important to complete these tasks. The leaders of some district and county party committees and primary organizations do not pay attention to how party members are fulfilling the task of raising their ideological and political levels, with the result that many communists are theoretically backward, have weak activity capabilities, are lax in discipline, and have reduced revolutionary vigilance. Party newspapers are a powerful weapon for propagating Marxism-Leninism, and they can speak quickly and directly to the broad masses of party members and non-party people, but such a powerful weapon has still not been properly applied. It is well known that self-study of original works is the basic method for party cadres to study Marxism-Leninism. However, little attention is still paid to providing organized assistance to those who self-study Marxist-Leninist theory, nor is their study regularly supervised.

    Within communist parties in capitalist countries, some party workers sometimes underestimate the importance of Marxism-Leninism for cadres who are in the midst of acute class struggle. Obviously, these comrades, who do not understand that theory and practice are inseparable, often incorrectly oppose the party's practical activities to political education. The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain recently pointed out that some party members regard the study of Marxist-Leninist theory as a matter for a small number of "experts" and often use the saying that they should "first" work in mass organizations as an excuse for not paying sufficient attention to raising their theoretical level.

    The historically significant and great experience of the Bolshevik Party shows that the task of mastering Marxist-Leninist theory is not something that only a small number of workers are capable of doing. It is the responsibility of every communist to tirelessly increase his theoretical knowledge and learn how to apply this knowledge to daily work.

    Knowledge of Marxist-Leninist theory can give communists new strength and give them firm confidence in the victory of the working-class cause. With this powerful ideological weapon of combat, communists enhance their revolutionary vigilance, strengthen their irreconcilability towards all opportunistic distortions of the theory of proletarian revolution, enable them to overcome the ideological remnants of social democracy, overcome bourgeois nationalism and chauvinism, and overcome the lies, slanders, and inhumane clamor of the imperialist war-mongers. It must be remembered that "any disregard for socialist ideology, any departure from this ideology, strengthens bourgeois ideology" (Lenin). The ideological training of party members is the most important prerequisite for the success of the work of communist and workers' parties in all countries.

    Communist and workers' parties in all countries are training tens of millions of firm and fearless revolutionary fighters by improving the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres, so that they can be infinitely loyal to the great cause of liberating the working people from the shackles of imperialism, and to the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    不倦地钻研马列主义理论是共产党人的责任和义务
     ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”总第一五○期社论
    世界各国共产党和工人党所以有力量，所以不可战胜，是由于它们的一切工作、它们的战略和策略，都是以伟大的马克思—列宁主义理论为指南的。马克思—列宁主义理论，科学地揭示了社会发展的规律，指出了怎样应用这些规律来指导工人阶级的革命斗争。
    斯大林同志教导说，“马克思主义是关于自然和社会的发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫、被剥削群众如何进行革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家获得胜利的科学，是关于建设共产主义社会的科学。”这个科学使共产党和工人党能够在一定的形势中找到正确的方向，能够了解事变的内部联系并预见事物的进程，能够不但看清楚事变在目前怎样发展和向什么方向发展，而且看清楚在将来要怎样发展和向什么方向发展。
    斯大林同志指出，只有精通了马克思—列宁主义理论的党才能够前进，才能够确有把握地领导工人阶级。列宁教导我们，“只有受到最先进的理论指导的党才能够担负起先锋队的任务。”
    每一天都有新的事物证明了马克思—列宁主义学说的蓬勃的生气。马克思—列宁主义已经具体表现在苏联人民的伟大业迹和成就上、人民中国的政治上和经济上的胜利上、人民民主国家在社会主义建设方面的成功上、资本主义国家和殖民地国家的人民粉碎帝国主义枷锁的斗争和国际和平、民主和社会主义阵营的不断加强上。
    由于共产党和工人党当前的思想、政治和组织工作一天天复杂起来，由于群众的政治活动空前增长起来，对于党领导干部和每一个共产党人的要求也就愈高了。他们必须懂得马克思—列宁主义理论，并且能够应用这个理论来解决实际工作上的种种问题。共产党人要有这方面的能力，只有不倦地提高自己的思想——理论水平。各人民民主国家总结出来的上一学年党教育的成绩，证明了党的教育工作已有很大的改善，研究马克思—列宁主义理论的党员和非党人士已大为增加。在中华人民共和国，在各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的光辉著作，是成百万卷地出版和销行的。在一切国家中销行最广的是“联共
    （布）党史简明教程”。这本书是马克思—列宁主义的基本知识的一本斯大林百科全书，是政治经验和政治智慧的无穷源泉。
    各人民民主国家都仿效联共（布）党的榜样，在党教育制度中实行了统一的学年制，把它作为党工作的重要部分。几十万共产党人在中央和州党校中、在马列主义夜大学中、在城乡党活动分子学习班中、在“联共（布）党史简明教程”和列宁、斯大林传略讲习班中，受到了训练。自修马克思—列宁主义理论的党员都得到了党辅导站的帮助，得到了演讲和座谈会的帮助。指导员的成份和指导员的程度，都有了显著的改善。
    虽然资本主义和殖民地国家的共产党是在警察迫害和法西斯挑衅这种困难条件下进行工作的，但是它们对于党员的思想教育和革命锻炼是越来越关心了。提高全体党员思想水平这个问题是意大利共产党第七届代表大会上的讨论中心。几十万的意大利共产党员正在中央和地方的党校，在短期的斯大林训练班和葛拉姆西训练班里学习。法国共产党中央委员会已一再告诫它所有的党员：争取和平、争取工人阶级团结和争取法国独立的斗争任务正在日益增加，这种形势要求共产党人具有更高的思想水平。在法国，除了为党的干部开办中央与省的党校以外，还组织了许多区党校，在这些党校中有成千上万的党员在学习。这些国家都在举办讲演来讲述帝国主义战争的由来和性质的马克思—列宁主义学说，社会主义制度与资本主义制度共存的可能性以及和平、民主和社会主义堡垒的苏联的作用。这些报告还印发出去。
    拉丁美洲、近东和其他国家的共产党是在恐怖和迫害的艰苦状况下进行工作的，现在它们也正在提高它们党员的思想水平。这些国家的共产党克服了巨大的困难，出版和发行马克思—列宁主义的经典著作、党的报刊、小册子和传单。
    在党教育制度的新学年开始之际，人民民主国家的共产党与工人党正在竭力克服它们在党员政治教育方面的缺点，改善政治教育的内容，提高各种训练班、讲习班和辅导站的质量和思想水平，把战斗的精神灌输到党的教育中去，把教育与建设社会主义的实际工作结合起来，给辅导员以全面的理论上和方法上的帮助。正因为在过去，如人民民主国家的报纸所指出的，各部门党教育的学习是在思想——政治水平不高的基础上进行的，所以完成这些任务，就来得格外重要了。某些区和县的党委员会以及基层组织的领导人员不注意党员怎样在完成提高他们的思想政治水平这一任务，其结果是使许多共产党员在理论上落后，活动能力薄弱，纪律松弛，革命的警惕性减低。党报是宣传马克思列宁主义的强大武器，它可以迅速而直接地向广大的党员与非党群众说话，但是像这样强大的武器仍然还没有适当地加以应用。大家知道，自学原著是党的干部学习马克思—列宁主义的基本方法。然而，对于这些自学马克思—列宁主义理论的人，仍然很少注意给他们以有组织的帮助，也不对他们的学习予以经常的督导。
    在资本主义国家的共产党里面，有些党的工作者有时低估了马克思—列宁主义对于处于尖锐的阶级斗争中的干部的重要意义。很显然，这些不懂得理论与实践是不可分的同志，常常不正确地把党的实际活动与政治教育对立起来。英国共产党执行委员会最近指出，有些党员把学习马克思—列宁主义理论当作一小部分“专家”的事情，并常常把“首先”应在群众组织中工作这种说法当作他们不去充分注意提高他们的理论水平的藉口。
    布尔什维克党的有历史意义的伟大经验表明：精通马克思—列宁主义理论的任务并不是只有一小部分工作者才有能力做到。每一个共产党员的责任是不倦地增加他的理论知识，学习怎样把这种知识应用到日常的工作中去。
    马克思—列宁主义理论知识可以给予共产党员以新的力量，使他们对于工人阶级事业的胜利具有坚定的信心。靠了这种有力的战斗思想武器，共产党人提高了他们的革命警惕性，加强了他们对一切机会主义歪曲无产阶级革命理论的不可调和性，使他们战胜了社会民主主义的思想残余，战胜了资产阶级的民族主义和沙文主义，战胜了帝国主义战争贩子的谎言、诽谤和无人性的叫嚣。必须记住，“对于社会主义思想有任何轻视，稍为离开了这种思想，就是加强了资产阶级的思想”
    （列宁）。党员的思想锻炼是各国共产党与工人党工作成功的最重要的先决条件。
    各国共产党与工人党正以改善干部的马克思—列宁主义的教育来锻炼数十百万坚定而无畏的革命战士，使他们对于把劳动人民从帝国主义羁绊下解放出来的伟大事业，对于和平、民主和社会主义事业能够无限忠心。
