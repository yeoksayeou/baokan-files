    Severely Punish the Murderer Who Abused and Killed a Woman!
    Editor:
    After seeing the news in the People's Daily on October 7th that the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court executed Liang Yongshi and Liang Wangshi, a mother and son who abused and killed Liang Anshi, a woman from Suixian County, Henan Province, I fully support this measure taken by the People's Government. The Wangshi mother and son were too cruel to women. Only by resolutely and severely punishing such acts of extreme abuse of women can similar incidents be truly prevented from happening again in the future. We demand that rural cadres and staff of people's governments at all levels must thoroughly fight against feudal remnants with a highly responsible attitude towards the people, and must not be negligent in the slightest; only in this way can the Marriage Law be implemented, and can the vast number of women trapped in the bitter sea of feudal marriage be truly liberated.

    严惩虐杀妇女的凶犯！编辑同志：
    看到人民日报十月七日登载的最高人民法院中南分院对虐杀河南省睢县妇女梁安氏的凶犯梁永诗、梁王氏母子执行枪决的消息后，我对人民政府这项措施万分拥护。王氏母子对妇女太残忍了，对于这种极端虐待妇女的行为，只有坚决予以严惩，才能真正地杜绝以后不再发生类似事件。我们要求乡村干部和各级人民政府工作人员，一定以对人民高度负责的态度，彻底地和封建残余作斗争，决不可以丝毫马虎；只有这样才能使婚姻法贯彻执行，才能使陷入封建婚姻苦海中的广大妇女真正得到解放。
