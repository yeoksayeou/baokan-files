Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd: Over the past year, the people of Northeast China have contributed tremendous strength to the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, protect the homeland, and defend the country. When, in October of last year, American imperialism expanded its war of aggression to the Yalu River, seriously threatening the security of our country's borders, the people of Northeast China were filled with righteous indignation and, under the slogan of "Defending the Motherland, Defending the Hometown," flocked to the Korean battlefield in droves, joining the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and volunteer stretcher teams to help the Korean people resist the invaders. Taking the Changbai Mountain area, a frontier post of national defense, as an example, more than 2,000 young people joined the Volunteer Army, and more than 1,000 stretchers were sent to participate in the logistical work on the Korean battlefield. Andong City, which persisted in production under the barbaric bombing of American planes, had more than 500 young workers sign up to join the Volunteer Army and more than 200 female workers volunteer to go to Korea for rescue work within a few days after the start of the Resist America and Aid Korea campaign. In the more remote rear of Northeast China, in the "no-man's land" of Xinglong, Qinglong, Chengde, Pingquan and other counties in Rehe Province, which had been severely devastated by Japanese invaders, more than 430 people spontaneously joined volunteer stretcher teams.

In the vigorous volunteer participation movement, many model deeds of sending sons and husbands to the front emerged in various parts of Northeast China. Song, an old lady in Huanren County, Liaodong Province, had ten sons tortured to death one after another due to hunger and cold during the rule of the Japanese invaders, and her life gradually improved after liberation. When she heard that the American invaders had reached the Yalu River and wanted to destroy her peaceful life, she sent her last son, Song Maoying, to join the Volunteer Army.

While enthusiastically participating in the Volunteer Army and stretcher teams, medical personnel, car drivers, and railway workers from all over Northeast China also volunteered to go to the Korean battlefield to serve. According to incomplete statistics, over the past year, more than 22 percent of medical personnel in the region have participated in the treatment of wounded soldiers on the Korean battlefield or in the rear. Nearly 10,000 railway employees, led by the famous labor model Du Xianyang, and thousands of car drivers formed various volunteer transportation teams and engineering teams to serve on the Korean battlefield. They engaged in busy military transport day and night, ensuring the supply of materials to the front lines despite the difficult conditions of rugged mountain roads and enemy plane harassment.

Many of those who volunteered to go to the Korean front have made brilliant achievements in combat and logistics work. Among the personnel from Shenyang who participated in the war in Korea, 202 have been commended for meritorious service in the past year, including Zhang Lingyun and Wang Longxing, who have both been credited with six major meritorious services in a row. More than 100 people in the first batch of volunteer stretcher teams from Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, won honorary titles on the Korean front. Qu Hongyi, a stretcher bearer in his fifties, captured two prisoners while rescuing the wounded. Another squad of stretcher bearers captured more than 20 soldiers of the Lee Seung-man bandit army while transferring the wounded. One-third of the stretcher team sent to Korea, which was composed of farmers from Panshi County, Jilin Province, were awarded meritorious service.

In the past year, in addition to providing manpower to aid the Korean people's war of liberation, the people of Northeast China have also supported the Korean people with a large amount of material. In late November of last year, the people of the region launched a large-scale comfort campaign amidst celebrations of the successive victories of the Chinese and Korean people's armies. Around the New Year, the慰劳品 (comfort goods) and慰问金 (monetary gifts) donated by the people of Northeast China were worth more than 238 billion Northeast currency; the people of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces alone wrote more than 125,000 consolation letters. In order to supply the Volunteer Army with cultural nourishment, the people of the region donated more than 879,000 books and periodicals. In addition, the people of Northeast China donated 50 billion Northeast currency (equivalent to more than 5,700 tons of grain) and 20,000 sets of clothing to aid Korean refugees.

    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中
    东北人民一年来贡献了巨大力量
    人民成群结队奔赴朝鲜前线创造光辉功绩
    大量捐输物资现款支援朝鲜人民解放战争
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】一年来东北人民在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中贡献了巨大的力量。当去年十月间，美帝国主义把侵略战争扩大到鸭绿江边，严重地威胁我国边境的安全时，东北各地人民义愤万分，即在“保卫祖国、保卫家乡”的口号下，成群结队地奔赴朝鲜战场，参加人民志愿军和志愿担架队，帮助朝鲜人民抵抗侵略者。仅拿国防前哨的长白山区为例，即有两千多青年参加了志愿军，并出动了一千多副担架参加朝鲜战场的后勤工作。在美机野蛮轰炸下坚持生产的安东市，在抗美援朝开始后几天内，有五百多青年工人报名参加志愿军，二百多女工志愿赴朝作救护工作。在较远的东北后方，曾经遭受日寇严重摧残的热河省兴隆、青龙、承德、平泉等县的“无人区”内，自动参加志愿担架队的也有四百三十多人。
    在如火如荼的志愿参战运动中，东北各地涌现了许多送子送夫上前线的模范事例。辽东省桓仁县的宋老太太在日寇统治时因饥寒交迫，有十个儿子先后被折磨而死，解放后生活逐渐改善。当她听到美国侵略者打到鸭绿江边，要来破坏她的和平生活时，便把最后一个儿子宋茂英也送去参加志愿军。
    在踊跃参加志愿军和担架队同时，东北各地医务人员、汽车司机、铁路工人，也纷纷志愿前往朝鲜战地服务。据不完全统计：一年来，全区医务人员有百分之二十二以上参加了朝鲜战地或后方的医治伤员的工作。以著名劳动模范杜先扬为首的近万名铁路员工和数千名汽车司机，组成了各种志愿运输队和工程队到朝鲜战地服务。他们在山路崎岖、敌机骚扰的困难情况下，日夜从事繁忙的军事运输工作，保证了前线的物资供应。
    志愿前往朝鲜前线参战的人们中，有不少在战斗中和后勤工作中创造了光辉的功绩。沈阳市赴朝参战的人员中，一年来有二百零二名立功受奖，其中张龄云、王龙兴等都曾连立六次大功。辽东省辑安县首批志愿担架队中，有一百多人在朝鲜前线荣获光荣称号。五十多岁的担架队员曲洪一在抢救伤员时还捉了两名俘虏。另一小队担架队员在转运伤员途中曾活捉李承晚匪军二十多名。吉林省磐石县农民组成的赴朝担架队中，有三分之一的人立了功。
    东北人民在过去一年中除了以人力援助朝鲜人民解放战争外，并以大量物资支援朝鲜人民。去年十一月下旬，全区人民在庆祝中朝人民军队节节胜利声中，开展了规模巨大的慰问运动。新年前后，东北各地人民捐献的慰劳品连同慰问金共值东北币二千三百八十多亿元；仅辽东、辽西、松江、黑龙江四省人民即写了十二万五千多封慰问信。为了供应志愿军的文化食粮，全区人民捐献了书刊八十七万九千多册。此外，东北各地人民又捐集东北币五百亿元（折购粮食五千七百多吨）和两万套衣服救济朝鲜难民。
