Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: In order to welcome the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers Army's participation in the Korean War with practical actions, the Beijing Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch held an expanded standing committee meeting on the 21st. The meeting decided on four commemoration measures: (1) On the 25th of this month, the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters, the North China Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Branch, and the Beijing Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch will jointly convene a "Capital People's Celebration of the First Anniversary of Victory in the Anti-American and Aid-Korea War Commemoration Meeting"; all factories, schools, government organizations, and mass organizations in the city, and citizens in each district can convene their own celebration meetings according to their specific circumstances to inspect donation work, patriotic pacts, and preferential treatment for the families of martyrs and soldiers. (2) Expand the production increase and economy practice movement, calling on the people of the city to complete more than 80 percent of the total amount of donations pledged by the people of the city before and after the 25th. (3) Seriously and thoroughly inspect the implementation of patriotic pacts, establish a system of criticism and praise for the implementation of patriotic pacts, and promote all units to continue to revise and improve patriotic pacts in combination with their own business. (4) Continue to comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers. Before the 25th, preferential treatment grain will be distributed to the families of martyrs and soldiers, and the winter coal problem for the families of martyrs and soldiers will be solved with emphasis. On the morning of the 25th, the families of martyrs and soldiers will be treated to a free movie.慰问 money will be given to wounded and sick soldiers. Various districts will organize various evening parties to comfort the families of martyrs, soldiers, and wounded and sick soldiers.

[Report from this newspaper] As of the 11th, People's Banks across Hebei Province had collected 103.50246 billion yuan in aircraft and artillery donations on behalf of the people, accounting for more than 83 percent of the province's original plan to donate 80 fighter planes. The number of donations pledged by people in various places has reached more than 127.9 billion yuan, enough to buy 85 fighter planes. The donation figures in Cangxian, Tangshan, Tianjin, Baoding and other regions have all exceeded the original donation plans of each region. Most areas of the province attached importance to the leadership of the donation work. For example, the majority of rural cadres and propagandists in the Baoding region generally adopted the "contract system" of work methods, which not only drove the masses to earnestly implement the donation plan and actively increase production, but also mobilized the masses to formulate payment plans, helped the masses solve difficulties in payment, and assisted the People's Bank in collecting donations from the masses and turning objects into cash. This ensured the timely completion or early over-completion of the donation plan. However, some areas relaxed their leadership of the donation movement, resulting in very slow development of the donation movement. For example, the Dingxian region originally planned to donate six fighter planes, but by mid-October, the number of donations pledged could only buy three fighter planes, and the payment was only more than 1.9 billion yuan. A total of more than 11.2 billion yuan was pledged in the Hengshui region, but only more than 1.9 billion yuan was paid. In some counties, the amount paid was only 1% of the amount pledged. This imbalance needs to be overcome. In addition, in some counties and districts that have completed the donation plan, leading cadres believe that they have completed the donation plan and thus completed the three major calls of the China Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association. As a result, they have begun to relax their efforts in inspecting and revising patriotic pacts and further deepening patriotic education. This phenomenon is wrong. These areas should, on the existing basis, educate the masses with vivid examples by summarizing the work of increasing production and donations, further enhance the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, continue to deepen the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement, carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and seize the inspection and revision of patriotic pacts to promote the progress of various work.

    北京市抗美援朝分会订出纪念办法
    迎接志愿军出国作战周年
    河北省人民缴纳献款逾千亿元
    【新华社二十一日讯】为了以实际行动迎接中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年纪念，北京市抗美援朝分会在二十一日召开了扩大常务委员会。会上决定四项纪念办法：（一）在本月二十五日由中国人民抗美援朝总会、华北区抗美援朝总分会和北京市抗美援朝分会联合召开“首都人民庆祝抗美援朝一周年胜利纪念大会”；全市各工厂、学校、机关团体和各区市民按照具体情况可分别召开本单位的庆祝会，检查捐献工作、爱国公约和优待烈士家属、军人家属等工作。（二）扩大增产节约运动，号召全市人民在二十五日前后，完成全市人民认捐总数百分之八十以上的缴款任务。（三）认真深入检查爱国公约的执行情况，建立对执行爱国公约的批评和表扬制度，推动各单位结合本身业务继续修订和改进爱国公约。（四）继续进行慰问烈属和军属。在二十五日以前发给烈属和军属优抚粮，有重点地解决烈属和军属的冬季燃煤问题。二十五日上午，免费招待烈属和军属看电影。对于伤病军人将发给慰问金。各区将组织各种晚会慰问烈属、军属和伤病军人。
    【本报讯】河北全省截至十一日止，各地人民银行已代收飞机大炮献款一千零三十五亿零二百四十六万元，占该省原计划捐献八十架战斗机总值的百分之八十三强。各地人民认捐数字已达一千二百七十九亿元以上，可买战斗机八十五架。沧县、唐山、天津、保定等专区的缴款数字，都超过了各该专区原订的捐献计划。全省大部分地区重视了对捐献缴款工作的领导。如保定专区广大农村干部和宣传员，普遍采用了“包干制”的工作方法，不仅带动群众切实执行捐献计划，积极增加生产，还发动群众制订了缴款计划，帮助群众解决缴款中的困难，并协助人民银行代收群众的献款和将实物变成现款。这样就保证了捐献计划的按期完成或提前超额完成。但也有一部分地区放松了对捐献运动的领导，致使捐献运动发展很慢。如定县专区原计划捐献六架战斗机，到十月中认捐款数还只能买三架战斗机，缴款仅十九亿余元。衡水专区共认捐了一百一十二亿余元，缴款也只有十九亿余元。有的县甚至缴款数还只有认捐数的百分之一。这种不平衡现象尚待克服。另外，某些已完成捐献计划的县区，领导干部认为完成了捐献计划，即完成了抗美援朝总会三大号召，因而对检查修订爱国公约，进一步深入爱国主义教育等工作开始松懈。这种现象是不对的。这些地区，应该在现有基础上，通过总结增产捐献工作，用生动事例教育群众，进一步提高群众爱国热情，继续深入抗美援朝运动，开展增产节约运动，并抓紧检查修订爱国公约，以此来推动各种工作前进。
