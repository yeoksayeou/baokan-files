    Response to Criticism and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily
    A Coal Plant of the Beijing Coal Mining Company Has Noticed and Improved Safety Equipment

    To the Editors:
    The People's Daily published a letter from reader Li Shouyi on September 16, criticizing the Chaoyangmen Coal Plant under our company for not paying attention to safety equipment. We immediately conducted an investigation, convened an expanded cadre meeting for self-criticism, and studied methods for future improvement.

    The occurrence of worker injury accidents in the coal plant under our company is the result of our unclear understanding of the importance of relying on workers. The plant site is small, but the amount of coal stored has greatly increased; the plant only increased the height of the coal piles to solve this contradiction but neglected the safety of the workers. The plant lacked political education for lower-level cadres, and some cadres had significant ideological errors, saying things like, "Since we paid for the loading and unloading, they have to load and unload." The lighting equipment in the plant was also very inadequate. These situations fully demonstrated the plant's disregard for worker safety, and we should pay serious attention to this in the future.

    We sincerely accept the criticism, which can help us improve our work. To solve this problem, all leading cadres of our company conducted self-criticism. Strict criticism and education were given to the personnel involved. The plant's lighting equipment has already been improved. Coal piles will no longer be increased after reaching an appropriate height, and other solutions will be sought. At the same time, education was conducted for all comrades in other plants to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    Comrade Li Shouyi pointed out in his criticism: Worker Sun Huitang was hit by a piece of coal and fell off a springboard while unloading coal on the afternoon of June 22; workers Shi Zhefeng, Peng Ying, Ma Degui, and Hou Zhenhu also fell off the springboard and were injured one after another. According to our on-site investigation and conversations with the injured workers, Li Comrade's statement does not correspond to the facts. Sun Huitang was not hit by a piece of coal, but fell and was injured due to his own carelessness; Shi Zhefeng was bumped by the car door when opening the car door because he was not careful; Hou Zhenhu was hit by a piece of coal while unloading coal. These things show that some workers are not careful enough when working. Therefore, we suggest that the Railway Loading, Unloading and Supply Cooperative should strengthen education for workers to prevent accidents from happening.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应  北京煤业分公司某煤厂已注意改进安全设备

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    北京煤业分公司某煤厂已注意改进安全设备编辑同志：
    九月十六日人民日报发表了读者李守一的来信，批评我公司所属朝阳门煤厂不注意安全设备的错误。我们立即进行调查，并召开扩大干部会议进行检讨，和研究今后改进的办法。
    我公司所属煤厂发生震伤工人事故，是我们依靠工人的思想不明确的结果。该厂地址很小，但收贮煤量大增；该厂只是将煤垛增高，解决这个矛盾，但忽视了工人的安全。该厂对下层干部缺少政治教育，个别干部思想上有很大的错误，说什么“花了抬卸钱就得抬卸”。厂内照明设备也是很不够的。这些情况充分表现了该厂漠视工人的安全，今后应严重注意。
    我们诚恳地接受批评，这种批评能帮助我们改进工作。为了解决这一问题，我公司全体领导干部都进行了检讨。对有关人员给予了严格地批评和教育。该厂照明设备业已改善。煤垛在达到适当高度后即不再增高，另想其他办法解决。同时并对其他各厂全体同志进行了教育，以防类此事件再次发生。
    李守一同志在批评中提出：工人孙惠棠于六月二十二日下午卸煤时，被煤块砸下跳板；工友石者凤、彭英、马德贵、侯振湖等也先后由跳板掉下受伤，据我们实地了解及与受伤工人谈话，李同志所提与事实并不相符。孙惠棠并不是被煤块砸下来的，而是他自己不慎失脚跌下来摔伤的；石者凤是在开车门时，因不留意被车门碰伤的；侯振湖是在卸煤时被煤块碰伤的。这些事情，都说明了有些工人，在工作时不够小心，因此我们建议：铁路装卸供应社对工人应加强教育，以防止意外事情发生。
