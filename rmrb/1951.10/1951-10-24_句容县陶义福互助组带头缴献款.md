    Jurong County's Tao Yifu Mutual Aid Team Takes the Lead in Paying Contributions
    Editor:
    After seeing the news in the newspaper that labor models and mutual aid teams in various places have completed their donation plans, our mutual aid team launched a discussion and decided not to lag behind. We collectively paid off our contribution on September 27th. The day before, each household gathered the dried and cleaned rice, totaling 1,300 jin. On the morning of the 27th at 4:00 AM, we collectively carried the rice to the China Grain Company's purchasing station to exchange it for money, and then deposited the money in the bank. Under our leadership, all 156 households in the village increased production and donated 6,035 jin of rice. Worker Fan Jinfa, who is 67 years old, even pushed 150 jin of rice to donate. In this way, the whole village collectively completed the donation figure within two hours.
    Editor, this time I have been selected as a labor model representative of Jurong County and honorably attended the Sunan Labor Model Conference. I used to be illiterate. This letter was written by someone else for me. I will study hard and guarantee that I can write to you myself this winter.

    句容县陶义福互助组带头缴献款编辑同志：
    从报上看到各地劳动模范及互助组纷纷完成捐献计划的消息后，我们互助组就展开讨论，决心不落人后，在九月二十七日集体缴清献款。前一日各户就把晒干挑净的稻谷集拢到一起，共有一千三百斤。二十七日晨四时，我们就集体把稻谷挑往中国粮食公司收购处换成款，然后再把款缴银行。在我们的带头下，全村一百五十六户，共增产捐献六千零三十五斤稻子。工属范金发年已六十七岁，还推着一百五十斤稻谷前往捐献。就这样，全村在两小时内，就集体完成了捐献数字。
    编辑同志，这次我已被选为句容县的劳动模范代表，光荣地出席了苏南劳动模范大会。我过去一字不识，这封信是请人代写的。我一定要努力学习，保证今冬自己能写信给你们。
                    苏南句容四区  陶义福
