    The Patriotic Pact Movement Over the Past Year
    In the past year, people from all walks of life across the country have actively formulated patriotic pacts. This movement has begun to guide the broad masses of people to infuse their anti-imperialist and patriotic fighting will and enthusiasm into various practical tasks, powerfully promoting the cause of defending and building the motherland.
    According to statistics from the four major administrative regions of Northeast, North, East, and Northwest China, over 50 percent of the population in various provinces and regions have formulated patriotic pacts, and the number of people who have formulated patriotic pacts in major and medium-sized cities accounts for 60 to 90 percent of the population. Even the ethnic minority people on the distant Tianshan Plateau are enthusiastically carrying out the patriotic pact movement. In Dihua City, Xinjiang Province, 90 percent of the residents have formulated family patriotic pacts.
    Formulating patriotic pacts is a new method created by the masses of people in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to unite and educate themselves. After the General Association of the Chinese People to Resist America and Aid Korea issued a call to universally carry out the patriotic pact movement in June of this year, this spontaneous mass activity gradually developed into a guided and planned movement. With the widespread and in-depth development of patriotic education to Resist America and Aid Korea, the scope of formulating patriotic pacts has also expanded from large units to various grassroots units. In July and August, various localities also implemented the call of the July 4th communiqué of the General Association of the Chinese People to Resist America and Aid Korea, universally inspected the implementation of patriotic pacts, and increased the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in formulating and implementing patriotic pacts, further popularizing and deepening the movement.
    In the process of formulating and implementing patriotic pacts, the broad masses of people have raised their political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm, and more actively participated in the struggles and construction endeavors of Resist America and Aid Korea, consolidating national defense, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and developing industrial and agricultural production.
    Tens of thousands of laborers have proposed when formulating patriotic pacts: what the motherland needs, we have; when the front and rear unite, we can defeat the American devils. Large numbers of transport workers, farmers, and medical workers have gone to the Korean front to serve; the number of people who have signed up to join the Volunteer Army in various places has greatly exceeded the needs of the front. Young farmers in many villages in Hebei Province swore when signing the patriotic pact: We are ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time and volunteer to go to Korea to Resist America. Many students wrote in their patriotic pacts: "Study hard, exercise, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time." After the movement to increase production and donate money flourished, the masses of people revised their patriotic pacts one after another, listing specific plans for increasing production and donating money as important content of the pacts. Many units completed the donation plans ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. People in various places regard doing a good job in preferential treatment as a major political task to support the Korean front and consolidate national defense. They solemnly incorporate this work into the patriotic pact and, according to the pact, use various methods to help the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of soldiers, and disabled soldiers solve their difficulties. In order to support the front, business circles in various places have included "actively paying taxes" and "assisting the government in stabilizing prices" as important items in their patriotic pacts, and earnestly implemented them. Businessmen in Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan and other places have successively held collective tax payment parades of thousands to tens of thousands of people. Industrial and commercial people in Zhuqiao Town, Nanhui, Southern Jiangsu, formed a team, beat gongs and drums, and ran more than ten miles to the county town to pay taxes. This has played a great role in assisting the government in stabilizing prices.
    The patriotic pacts of the people in various places mostly include the content of assisting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. After the residents of Paotaizhuang area in the Eleventh District of Tianjin formulated the patriotic pact, they reported more than 40 cases of counter-revolutionary elements to the People's Public Security Organs within a month. Many factories, mines, and villages have organized factory protection teams and patrol teams to carry out regular security and public order work in accordance with the patriotic pacts.
    The patriotic pact movement has achieved great results in promoting industrial and agricultural production. More than 2.23 million workers across the country who have formulated patriotic pacts have improved their work attitude, continuously improved their skills, and actively strived to increase national wealth in various factories and enterprises. The Sixth Mine of Hegang Coal Mine in Songjiang Province did not complete its coal mining tasks in January and February of this year. After the workers formulated the patriotic pact in March, they exceeded the first quarter production plan by 273 tons. The production of 15 factories, mines, and enterprises, such as Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant, exceeded the original plan in the second half of this year, and the profits obtained can buy 61 and a half fighter jets. In rural areas, the patriotic pact guaranteed the completion of farmers' bumper harvest plans. Many farmers posted their patriotic pacts under the portrait of Chairman Mao, and wanted to respond to Chairman Mao's call with actions to implement the pact. Xie Suo'er, a farmer in Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, sat in front of Chairman Mao's portrait for a while every night. He said: "When I am producing in the field, I often think of the patriotic pact. If I don't act according to the pact, I feel that I cannot go home to see Chairman Mao (referring to the portrait of Chairman Mao)."
    The patriotic pact movement has begun to play a great role in organizing and educating the masses and promoting various practical tasks across the country, but the development of the movement is still uneven. The patriotic pact movement in large and medium-sized cities has moved towards depth and persistence, while small cities and rural areas are relatively poor. In some areas, due to the Communist Party committees grasping ideological leadership, the movement has developed rapidly. However, in many areas, due to the leadership's failure to truly mobilize the masses, the formulation of patriotic pacts has not formed a mass movement, and many grassroots units have not yet formulated patriotic pacts; the patriotic pacts of some units were not formulated after bottom-up brewing and discussion, or they did not conduct regular inspections and revisions after the pacts were formulated, so they became formalities. Various localities are now correcting the above-mentioned deviations, overcoming shortcomings, drawing lessons, and further popularizing and deepening the patriotic pact movement.

### 一年来的爱国公约运动

    一年来的爱国公约运动
    近一年来，全国各地各界人民纷纷订立了爱国公约。这个运动已开始引导广大人民把反帝爱国的斗争意志和热情灌注到各种实际工作中，有力地推动了保卫祖国与建设祖国的事业。
    根据东北、华北、华东、西北四大行政区的统计，各省、区已有百分之五十以上的人口订立了爱国公约，各大、中城市中订立爱国公约的人数已占人口百分之六十到百分之九十。远在天山高原的少数民族人民也热情地开展了爱国公约运动。新疆省迪化市就有百分之九十的居民制订了家庭爱国公约。
    订立爱国公约，是人民群众在抗美援朝运动中创造出来用以团结和教育自己的新方法。到今年六月中国人民抗美援朝总会发出普遍开展爱国公约运动的号召后，这种群众自发性的活动便逐渐发展为有领导、有计划的运动。随着抗美援朝爱国教育的普遍和深入，订立爱国公约的范围也由大单位深入到各基层单位。七、八月份，各地又执行中国人民抗美援朝总会七月四日文告的号召，普遍地检查了爱国公约的执行情况，提高了广大人民订立和执行爱国公约的积极性，使运动进一步普及与深入。
    广大人民在订立与执行爱国公约的过程中，提高了自己政治觉悟和爱国热情，更加积极地参加抗美援朝、巩固国防、镇压反革命、发展工农业生产等项斗争和建设事业。
    成千成万的劳动者在订立爱国公约时提出：祖国要什么，我们有什么，前后方一致行动起来就能打败美国鬼子。大批的运输工人、农民和医务工作者纷纷到朝鲜前线去服务；各地报名参加志愿军的人数大大超过前线的需要。河北省许多村庄的青年农民在爱国公约上签名时宣誓：随时听候祖国召唤，志愿赴朝抗美。许多学生在爱国公约上写着：“学好本领，锻炼身体，随时响应祖国号召。”当增产捐献运动蓬勃开展后，人民群众纷纷修订爱国公约，把具体的增产捐献计划列为公约的重要内容。许多单位提前超额完成了捐献计划。各地人民把做好优抚工作当作支援朝鲜前线、巩固国防的重大政治任务。他们郑重地把这个工作订入爱国公约之内，并根据公约，用各种办法帮助革命烈士家属、军人家属与残废军人解决困难。为着支援前线，各地工商界都把“踊跃纳税”和“协助政府稳定物价”订为爱国公约的重要项目，并认真地加以执行。重庆、上海、北京、南京、武汉等地的工商界人士都先后举行了几千人到几万人的集体纳税大游行，苏南南汇祝桥镇工商业者排成队伍敲锣打鼓地跑十多里到县城里去纳税。这对于协助政府稳定物价起了很大作用。
    各地人民的爱国公约，绝大多数都包括了协助政府镇压反革命的内容。天津十一区炮台庄一带的居民订立爱国公约后，一个月内就向人民公安机关检举了反革命分子案件四十多起。许多工厂、矿山及村庄，都根据爱国公约组织了护厂队、巡查队，进行经常性的保卫和治安工作。
    爱国公约运动在推动工业、农业生产方面，已获得很大成绩。全国二百二十三万以上订立了爱国公约的工人，改善劳动态度、不断提高技术，在各工厂和企业中积极为增加国家财富而努力。松江省鹤岗煤矿六矿今年一、二月份都没有完成采煤任务，三月份订立爱国公约后，工人们超额二百七十三吨完成第一季度生产计划。北京琉璃河水泥厂等十五个工厂、矿山和企业，今年下半年的生产超过了原订计划，获得的利润可以买战斗机六十一架半。在农村中，爱国公约保证了农民们丰产计划的完成。许多农民把自己订的爱国公约贴在毛主席像的下面，要以执行公约的行动来响应毛主席的号召。陕西省富平县农民谢锁儿每天晚上在毛主席像前坐一会，他说：“我在地里生产时，常常想起爱国公约，如果不按公约办，就觉得无法回家见毛主席（指毛主席像）。”
    爱国公约运动在全国各地已开始发挥了组织和教育群众、推动各项实际工作的伟大作用，但运动的发展还不平衡。大、中城市的爱国公约运动已走向深入与持久，小城市与农村较差。有些地区由于中共党委抓紧了思想领导，运动得到迅速的发展。但在不少地区，由于领导方面未能真正发动群众，订立爱国公约并未形成群众性的运动，许多基层单位还没有订立爱国公约；有些单位的爱国公约，不是经过自下而上的酝酿、讨论而订立的，或者订立公约后没有定期进行检查与修订，所以流于形式。各地现正纠正上述偏向，克服缺点，吸取经验，进一步普及与深入爱国公约运动。（新华社）
