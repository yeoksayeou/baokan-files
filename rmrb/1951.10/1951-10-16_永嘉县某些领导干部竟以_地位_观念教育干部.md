     Certain Leading Cadres in Yongjia County Actually Educate Cadres with the Concept of "Position"
To the Editor:
    Certain county and district leading cadres in Yongjia County mistakenly encourage cadres to work by raising their "position." Wang Zhizhong, Secretary of the Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yongjia County, said when mobilizing all district and township cadres to carry out land reform and autumn grain collection work: "If you are given one or several villages, if you do the work well, and the higher authorities approve, you will become a district head or district committee member." Li Guimao, Director of the County Federation of Trade Unions, criticized the concept of position among cadres at a certain meeting, saying: "You can't always fantasize about position; you should strive for it." Some leading comrades believe that "the concept of position cannot be overcome; a person without a concept of position is useless." "The concept of position is not bad; it can stimulate cadres to 'progress'." Therefore, the concept of position has become a legitimate thing in the minds of cadres, and some cadres say: "The idea of promotion is inevitable." This is a reflection of a decadent individualistic thought and must be opposed and eliminated.

     永嘉县某些领导干部竟以“地位”观念教育干部编辑同志：
    永嘉县某些县区领导干部错误地以提高“地位”来鼓励干部工作。中共永嘉县第三区区委书记王志忠动员全体区乡干部进行土地改革和秋征工作时说：“交给你们一个村几个村，把工作做好，报上级批准，就当个区长区委。”县工会主任李桂茂在某次会议上批判干部的地位观念时说：“不能老空想地位，应当努力争取。”有些领导同志认为“地位观念是无法克服的，没有地位观念的人就没有用处。”“地位观念并不坏，它可以刺激干部‘进步’。”因此地位观念在干部思想上变成了合法的东西，有的干部就说：“升官思想免不了。”这是一种腐朽的个人主义思想的反映，必须反对和清除。
