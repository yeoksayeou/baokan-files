Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 4th: Our front-line reporter reports: On September 29th, our army unit inflicted severe losses on two regiments of the American invading army in the defensive battle in the Yeyue Mountain area, eight kilometers west of Tieyuan.

On the 29th, the enemy, with two regiments, attacked our army's Yeyue Mountain positions along multiple routes. When the enemy's infantry, under the cover of artillery fire and tanks, climbed to the front of our army's positions, they encountered a serious blow from our army. The vanguard troops of a certain unit of our army, holding the forward positions, launched eleven heroic charges against an enemy force approximately twenty times their size, killing and wounding over two hundred enemy soldiers. After the enemy paid a heavy price to occupy this forward position, our army immediately launched a strong counterattack on the area, quickly stormed into the enemy's ranks, and annihilated an entire enemy platoon of over thirty soldiers with submachine guns and grenades.

To coordinate the attack on our Yeyue Mountain, several other enemy forces launched attacks on positions adjacent to the mountain, but quickly retreated after encountering fierce resistance from our army.

In this day of fierce fighting, our army annihilated a total of over eight hundred and fifty enemy soldiers. In the area less than one kilometer north of Yeyue Mountain alone, the enemy abandoned over three hundred corpses. After achieving the goal of annihilating a large number of enemy troops, our army entered more advantageous positions slightly west of Yeyue Mountain, preparing to continue annihilating the enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 4th: A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a circular commending the heroic units that achieved a glorious victory in the Yeyue Mountain defensive battle on September 29th. The circular stated: The unit fought bravely in the Yeyue Mountain defensive battle, killing and wounding over eight hundred and fifty enemy soldiers. This excellent combat style is worthy of commendation. It is hoped that the commanders and fighters of the unit will continue to work hard, make full preparations, and deal a severe blow to any enemy who dares to invade again.

    志愿军某部在夜月山一带一天歼敌八百余
    作战有功的英勇部队受到通令表扬
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社前线记者报道：九月二十九日，我军某部在铁原以西八公里夜月山一带的阻击战中，使美国侵略军两个团遭受了严重的损失。
    二十九日，敌以两个团兵力分路进犯我军夜月山阵地。当敌人的步兵在炮火和坦克掩护下爬到我军阵地前沿时，却遇到了我军严重的打击。扼守在前沿阵地上的我军某部前哨部队，向超过自己约二十倍的敌军连续进行了十一次英勇冲杀，杀伤敌军二百余人。当敌军付出惨重代价占领这个前沿阵地后，我军旋即向该地发起了强力反击，迅速杀入敌阵，用冲锋枪、手榴弹把敌军一个排三十余人全部歼灭。
    为配合进攻我夜月山，另外数股敌军向该山邻近阵地进行攻击，遇到我军猛烈阻击后，迅即败退。
    在这一天的激战中，我军共计歼敌八百五十余名，仅在夜月山以北不到一公里的地段上，敌军即丢弃尸体三百余具。我军在达到大量歼灭敌军的目的后，即进入夜月山稍西的更有利的阵地，准备继续歼灭敌人。
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】中国人民志愿军某部通令表扬九月二十九日在夜月山阻击战中获得光辉胜利的英勇部队。通令中称：该部在夜月山阻击战中英勇作战，杀伤敌军八百五十余名，这种优良的战斗作风值得表扬，希望该部指战员继续努力，充分准备，给再犯之敌以严重打击。
