    Volunteer Army Soldiers Welcome Korean Correspondences Editorial Comrades:
    At the Korean front, People's Volunteer Army soldiers enthusiastically read newspapers from the motherland. They care about everything in the motherland, and they especially welcome the Korean correspondences in the newspapers. They often read Korean correspondences on the front lines, in air-raid shelters, and during breaks from combat. Those who are illiterate ask others to read to them. From these correspondences, they see the combat situations of themselves and their close comrades against American imperialism, receiving vivid patriotic and internationalist education. These Korean correspondences directly encourage the fighting spirit of the soldiers and strengthen their confidence in victory. Now, many Volunteer Army soldiers are familiar with correspondences such as "Who Are the Most Lovable People," "The Annihilation Battle on the Banks of Changjin Lake," and "Days and Nights on the South Bank of the Han River." They praise the heroic deeds of heroes like Yang Gensi and Guo Zhongtian, and take these people as their role models. For example, Chen Wen, a soldier from the Sixth Company of a certain Volunteer Army unit, said after reading "Who Are the Most Lovable People": "Although I have participated in several battles, captured four automatic rifles, and captured two Rhee Syngman puppet army prisoners, I have not captured an American devil or seized a machine gun, which is a regret. In the next battle, I must strive to seize a machine gun and capture American devils to answer the love of the people of the motherland for us." Such vows can be heard from many soldiers. It is hoped that the outstanding journalists and writers from the motherland who are active on the Korean front will reflect more of the Volunteer Army's heroic fighting, so as to educate the people of the whole country and encourage and educate the Volunteer Army soldiers.

    志愿军战士欢迎朝鲜通讯编辑同志：
    在朝鲜前线，人民志愿军的战士们热情地阅读着来自祖国的报纸。他们关怀着祖国的每一件事，他们更欢迎报纸上的朝鲜通讯。他们常常在阵地上，在防空洞里，在战斗休息的时候，阅读朝鲜通讯。不识字的，就找人读给他听。从这些通讯中，他们看到了自己和亲密的战友们对美帝国主义战斗的情况，接受生动的爱国主义和国际主义的教育。这些朝鲜通讯，直接鼓舞着战士们的战斗情绪，加强了战士们的胜利的信心。现在有许多志愿军的战士们都熟知“谁是最可爱的人”、“长津湖畔的歼灭战”、“汉江南岸的日日夜夜”等通讯。他们传颂着英雄杨根思、郭忠田等人的英雄事迹，并以这些人作为自己的榜样。如志愿军某部六连战士陈文，读过“谁是最可爱的人”后说：“我虽然已经参加了几次战役，缴获了四支自动步枪，捉了两个李承晚伪军俘虏，但没有捉到一个美国鬼子，没有缴获一挺机关枪，这是一件憾事。在下次战役中，我一定要争取缴获机枪，捉美国鬼子，以此来回答祖国人民对我们的热爱。”这样的誓言，是可以从不少战士那里听到的。希望活跃在朝鲜前线的祖国优秀的新闻工作者和作家们，多反映志愿军的英勇战斗的情形，以此教育全国人民，并鼓舞与教育志愿军的战士们。
