Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th: Our front-line reporter reports: In the past half-month of valiant fighting, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have inflicted a disastrous defeat on Van Fleet's so-called "Autumn Offensive" on the western Korean front. According to incomplete statistics from October 1st to 10th, the Korean-Chinese People's Army annihilated over 25,400 enemy troops, of which over 17,000 were American aggressor troops, over 2,600 were British accomplice troops, over 5,000 were Rhee's puppet troops, and the rest were accomplice troops from France, Greece, and other countries. In addition, our army destroyed 43 enemy tanks, 22 vehicles, and shot down or damaged 87 enemy aircraft over the front and rear lines. In the area west of Tieyuan and Lianchuan on the western front, the American aggressor troops and their accomplice troops have launched frantic offensives since September 29th. However, under the brave and tenacious combat of our Korean-Chinese People's forces, they have made very little progress other than suffering heavy casualties. On the 11th, the forward troops of a certain unit of our army, defending Shangpu and Xiapu, engaged in fierce fighting for a whole day with three companies of the 7th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the US Army. After inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, the unit launched a fierce counterattack at dusk, annihilating all three companies of the enemy in a night of fierce fighting, and capturing ten heavy machine guns, more than ten light machine guns, and more than 160 automatic rifles and carbines. More than 250 enemy corpses were found on the position alone. In the northeast area of Gaolangpu-ri, the 29th Brigade of the British Commonwealth Division also suffered heavy losses in the four-day battle of Ma Liangshan. In the area north of Yangkou on the eastern front, the enemy has been frantically attacking the mountainous area along the Baishi Mountain, Wendengli, and Jiaqifeng line for days, and has also suffered heavy losses. In the fierce fighting on the 9th alone, a certain unit of our army annihilated more than 900 enemy troops. "Heartbreak Ridge," which the enemy has been attacking fiercely for more than a month and has suffered heavy casualties, is still being contested. The Associated Press revealed on the 12th that the commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the US 2nd Division, Adams, had to admit in a report: "In the month-long battle of Heartbreak Ridge, the US infantry suffered heavy losses," which were "much greater than the losses they had suffered in previous battles." In view of the above situation, the "Autumn Offensive" launched by the American aggressors while obstructing the resumption of armistice negotiations can only lead to heavy casualties and more serious military failures, and nothing else.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th: Our front-line reporter reports: In the heroic battles to counter Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive" on the western Korean front, the Chinese and Korean People's armies have repeatedly created examples of battles of winning with fewer troops. The following is one example. The 7th Squad of the 2nd Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers defended the forward position of Height 246.6 west of Tieyuan, fought valiantly for four days and five nights, repelled seventeen frantic assaults by enemy forces fifteen times their size, and wiped out more than 100 troops of the 1st Cavalry Division of the American aggressor army.

This battle began at dawn on October 4th. The enemy used several artillery groups and four aircraft to bombard fiercely, attempting to destroy the forward position held by the 7th Squad. After thousands of shells were fired, an enemy infantry company launched an assault. The swarming enemy approached within 300 meters of our forward position without encountering any returning gunfire; they approached within 200 meters, and still there was calm; they approached within 100 meters, and still it was silent. They approached swaggeringly to within more than 30 meters of the forward position, when suddenly a dense barrage of machine-gun fire and a swarm of grenades flew at them, knocking down more than forty of them at once. The remaining enemies fled in panic. Immediately afterwards, the enemy rushed up from both sides, and a fierce battle ensued. The combat squad leader heroically sacrificed his life. Ma Shaozhong, who was appointed acting combat squad leader, immediately swore to his comrades in the name of a Communist Party member that he would resolutely complete any arduous task together with everyone. He immediately led two soldiers to counterattack the approaching enemy. Soldier Tang Guozhong threw grenade after grenade at the enemy, throwing more than forty in one breath. Squad leader Wang Yongda used four kinds of weapons in succession: when the enemy approached, he used submachine guns to sweep fiercely; when the enemy lay down, he threw grenades non-stop; when the enemy collapsed, he picked up a light machine gun to pursue them with firepower; when the soldiers ran out of grenades, he threw huge hand mines at the enemy. Encouraged by the resounding slogan of "Hold the position and annihilate the enemy!", they repelled all enemy offensives, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

    朝鲜西线我军打败敌军“秋季攻势”
    十天歼敌两万五千余人
    我军屡创以少胜多范例大量杀伤敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在过去半个月的奋战，已使范佛里特的所谓“秋季攻势”在朝鲜西线遭受惨败。据十月一日到十日十天中不完全的统计：朝中人民军队歼灭敌军二万五千四百余人，其中一万七千余人是美国侵略军，二千六百余人是英国帮凶军，五千余人是李伪军，其余的是法国、希腊等国帮凶军。另外，我军击毁敌战车四十三辆，汽车二十二辆，并在前线和后方的上空，击落击伤敌机八十七架。在西线铁原、涟川以西地区，美国侵略军及其帮凶军自九月二十九日起虽连续发动疯狂的进攻，但在我朝中人民部队英勇坚强的作战下除死伤累累外进展极微。十一日，坚守上浦防、下浦防的我军某部前哨部队与美军骑兵第一师骑七团的三个连激战竟日。该部队在大量杀伤敌军后，即于黄昏发起猛烈的反击，激战一夜，全歼敌军三个连，缴获重机枪十挺、轻机枪十余挺、自动步枪和卡宾枪一百六十余支。仅被打死在阵地上的敌尸就有二百五十具以上。在高浪浦里东北地区，英联邦师第二十九旅在马良山的四天战斗中也曾遭受重创。在东线杨口以北地区，敌军连日在白石山、文登里到加七峰一线山地疯狂进犯，也同样遭受重大损失。仅在九日一天的激战中，我军某部即歼敌九百余人。敌军猛攻月余、死伤累累的“伤心岭”，迄今仍在争夺中。美联社十二日透露美国第二师第二十三步兵团团长亚当斯在报告中也不得不承认：“在伤心岭一月来的战斗中，美军步兵遭到重大的损失”，比他们在过去的战斗中“所遭到的损失还要大得多”。照上述情况来看，美国侵略者在阻挠恢复停战谈判的同时所发动的“秋季攻势”，除了招致重大伤亡和走向更严重的军事失败以外，决不可能会有其他结果的。
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】本社前线记者报道：在朝鲜西线打击范佛里特“秋季攻势”的英勇战斗中，中朝人民军队屡创以少胜多的战斗范例，下面是其中的一个例子。中国人民志愿军某部第二连第七班的九个战士据守铁原以西二四六点六高地的前沿阵地，奋战四天五夜，打退了十五倍于己的敌军的十七次疯狂冲锋，消灭了美国侵略军骑兵第一师一百多人。
    这个战斗是在十月四日黎明开始的。敌军用几个炮群和四架飞机猛烈轰击，妄图摧毁第七班所坚守的前沿阵地。几千发炮弹轰击以后，敌军一个步兵连发起冲锋了。蜂涌而来的敌军迫近到离我前沿阵地三百米达时，没有碰到回击的枪弹；再迫近到二百米达时，又是平静无事；再迫近到一百米达时，还是寂然无声。他们大摇大摆地接近到离前沿阵地三十多米达时，突然迎面飞来了密集的机关枪弹和成群的手榴弹，一下他们就被打倒了四十多个，其余的敌人纷纷慌乱地向后逃窜了。紧接着敌人又从两侧扑上来，于是就展开了激烈的战斗。战斗小组长英勇牺牲了，被指定代理战斗小组长的马绍忠当场以共产党员的名义向战友们宣誓，坚决和大家一起完成任何艰巨的任务。他立即带领两个战士向迎面扑来的敌人反击过去。战士唐国忠将手榴弹一个接着一个地抛向敌人，一口气打出了四十多个。班长王永达一个人接着使用四种武器：当敌人接近时，就用冲锋枪猛烈扫射；当敌人卧倒时，就不停地抛掷手榴弹；当敌人溃逃时，就端起轻机枪进行火力追击；当战士们的手榴弹打完了，他就将巨大的手雷投向敌人。他们在“守住阵地，歼灭敌人！”的响亮口号鼓舞下，击退了敌人所有的进攻，使敌人遭致重大的杀伤。
