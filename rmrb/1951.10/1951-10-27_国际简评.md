International Brief Review

    The Unprecedented Unity of New York Dockworkers

    The New York dockworkers' strike, which began on the 15th at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, continues to persist and expand. Currently, it has brought work to a halt at 136 docks in New York, and the number of ships unable to leave the harbor has increased to 104. In addition, thousands of freight cars of goods transported to the port by rail cannot be unloaded. The New York water and land transportation system has been completely paralyzed. This strike is striking an increasingly heavy blow to the American war machine.

    The expansion and persistence of this strike has not only alarmed the American ruling class, but has also thrown into disarray the reactionary yellow union leaders of the "AFL" and "CIO," who have consistently provoked disunity among American workers and undermined American workers' strikes. In this strike, the New York working class has strengthened its internal unity, breaking the boundaries of "AFL" and "CIO" created by the American reactionaries among the workers. After the striking workers rejected the call to return to work by Ryan, chairman of the "AFL" International Longshoremen's Association, all New York dockworkers joined this wave of strikes, forcing Curran, chairman of the "CIO" National Maritime Union, to announce his obedience to the workers' strike measures. This has isolated the reactionary leaders of the "AFL" and "CIO" from the masses of workers. The strengthening of unity within the workers shows that the level of consciousness of the American working class has also greatly improved.

    New York is the nerve center of the American war machine. The New York dockworkers' strike has strengthened the American people's power to strike against the aggressive policies of the American government. Peace-loving people all over the world are concerned about and sympathize with this strike!

    Supporting the Hamburg Dockworkers' Strike

    At a time when American imperialism is stepping up its collusion with its West German puppet government to actively arm West Germany in preparation for a new war, dockworkers in Hamburg and Bremen, important ports in West Germany, went on strike on the 23rd to improve their living conditions, and hundreds of ships were stranded in the ports. The police of the West German reactionary government suppressed the strike, but the strikers did not yield. The great significance of the Hamburg dockworkers' strike lies in the fact that it shows that it is not American imperialism and its puppet Adenauer who truly control the fate of West Germany, but the people of West Germany. Without the people to drive, the war-mongers can absolutely achieve nothing. Does not the Hamburg dockworkers' strike render hundreds of ships useless? The most important task for the people of West Germany today is to unite under the banner of the German Democratic Republic and resolutely oppose the American imperialist war policy of using the West German people as cannon fodder. If all the people of West Germany act like the Hamburg dockworkers, the conspiracies of the United States, Britain, France, and their running dogs in West Germany will be completely bankrupt.

    国际简评
    纽约码头工人的空前团结
    纽约码头工人的罢工运动，自十五日在布鲁克林陆军码头开始，迄今仍在继续坚持与扩大中。目前已使纽约一百三十六个码头停止工作，停泊港内无法开出的船只已增加到一百零四艘；而从铁路运抵港口的数千辆车皮的货物，也没有办法卸下来。纽约水陆运输系统已经完全陷于瘫痪。这一罢工行动，正一日比一日更沉重地打击着美国的战争机构。
    这个罢工运动的规模的扩大和持久，不仅使美国统治集团陷于惊慌无措，而一贯挑拨美国工人团结、破坏美国工人罢工运动的“劳联”和“产联”的反动黄色工会领袖们，也陷于慌乱。在这次罢工运动中，纽约工人阶级加强了内部的团结，打破了美国反动派所制造的工人间“劳联”和“产联”的界限。罢工工人拒绝“劳联”国际码头工人联合会主席瑞安的复工要求后，所有纽约的码头工人都卷入了这一罢工怒潮，迫使“产联”全国海员工会主席寇兰也不得不宣布服从工人的罢工措施。这就使“劳联”和“产联”的反动领袖们，在工人群众中孤立起来。工人内部团结的加强，表明美国工人阶级的觉悟水平也大大提高了。
    纽约是美国战争机构的神经中枢，纽约码头工人的罢工增强了美国人民对于美国政府侵略政策的打击力量，全世界爱好和平人民都在关心和同情着这
    一罢工运动！
    声援汉堡码头工人的罢工
    美帝国主义正在加紧勾结其西德傀儡政府，积极武装西德，准备新的战争的时候，西德重要港口汉堡和不来梅的码头工人在二十三日起为了改善生活举行了罢工，成百只的船停顿在港口中。西德反动政府的警察，对罢工进行了镇压，但罢工者并没有屈服。汉堡码头工人罢工的重大的意义，在于说明真正能掌握西部德国命运的，并不是美帝国主义及其傀儡阿登纳，而是西部德国的人民。没有人民供驱使，战争贩子们是绝对不能有所作为的。汉堡码头工人的罢工，不是使成百只船失去作用吗？西部德国人民今天最重要的任务，就是应当在德意志民主共和国的旗帜下一致团结起来，坚决反对美帝国主义利用西德人民作炮灰的战争政策。如果全部西部德国人民都和汉堡码头工人一样行动起来，美英法及其走狗在西德的阴谋就要全部破产。
