Conscientiously Implement the Marriage Law
Shi Liang, Minister of Justice of the Central People's Government

    Since the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China on May 1, 1950, people's courts at all levels across the country, under the unified leadership of people's governments at all levels, have organized cadres to study the law, conducted publicity among the masses in conjunction with relevant departments, and properly handled many marriage cases. This has alleviated the suffering of many women oppressed by the feudal marriage system, laid a good foundation for the establishment of happy new families, and stimulated the production enthusiasm of young men and women, especially women. According to statistics from various regions, since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the number of marriage cases accepted by judicial organs at all levels has increased significantly. For example, in 21 large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, the number of cases received from January to April 1950 was 9,300, while the number received from May to August was 17,763, an increase of 91 percent in the four months after the promulgation of the Marriage Law compared to the previous four months. In ten county towns under the jurisdiction of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, the number of cases received from January to April 1950 was 986, while the number received from May to August was 1,982, an increase of 101 percent in the latter four months compared to the former four months. Furthermore, according to statistics from Hubei Province, each people's court handled 13.7 cases in February 1951 and 23.9 cases in July, indicating an increase in cases. Judging from the gender of those who actively filed for divorce, according to statistics from 32 large and medium-sized cities and 34 county towns in 20 provinces in 1950 (covering periods from two months to half a year), a total of 21,433 people filed for divorce, of whom women accounted for 76.56 percent and men accounted for 23.44 percent. From the above statistics, it can be seen that after the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law, the number of cases received in both urban and rural areas has increased significantly. Especially after the land reform, due to the increased awareness of the peasant masses, the demand for freedom of marriage has increased day by day, and the majority of those who raise marriage issues are women. This shows that the Marriage Law is one of the important weapons for liberating the broad masses of women from the feudal marriage system. Therefore, many liberated women sincerely expressed their gratitude, saying, "The Communist Party saved me from hell" and wanting to "thank Chairman Mao in the newspaper"; others said, "The People's Court is even closer than my own family." After gaining freedom of marriage, these women have changed their past dependent thinking of "marrying a man for food and clothing" and have become active participants in production and study in rural areas and factories, greatly contributing to social, economic, and cultural construction.

    The judicial cadres in various regions have made significant achievements in implementing the Marriage Law, but there are still problems, mainly manifested as: (1) Not paying attention to or incorrectly publicizing the Marriage Law, believing that publicizing the Marriage Law is the responsibility of the Women's Federation and should not be managed by the People's Court, otherwise it will "hinder the central task" and "increase trouble." Some also treat the publicity of the Marriage Law as a "crash task," doing it once or twice and considering it finished, making it neither extensive nor in-depth. Others one-sidedly propagate that "anyone you don't like can get a divorce," completely neglecting the positive role of the Marriage Law. (2) The most common bias is failing to actively support the just demands of women, and even failing to severely stop the serious phenomena of women being abused and killed or committing suicide due to marriage problems, imposing light sentences on cadres or masses who cause women's deaths, or even turning a blind eye and adopting a laissez-faire attitude. (3) In terms of trial style, the universal problem is the delay in handling cases. Many women who request a divorce have already spent much time through district and village governments, and are repeatedly delayed and unresolved in the county people's court. For example, in the divorce case of Ren Rutao in Wuyang County, Henan Province, it was dragged from 1948 to May 1951 without resolution (Henan Daily, May 27). Some handle cases neither by investigating among the masses nor by seeking help from relevant organs or groups, but simply close the case hastily in isolation.

    The reason why some judicial cadres have the above-mentioned biases or errors in handling marriage cases is mainly due to the following problems in understanding: (1) Underestimating the latent power of feudal ideology among the masses. Failing to recognize that although the feudal land exploitation system has collapsed with the liberation of all of China and the completion of the land reform movement, the feudal marriage system and its ideological customs still have a deep-rooted influence among the masses. As a result, the phenomenon of valuing men over women, regarding women as domestic slaves who serve their husbands and parents-in-law, and the feudal marriage system of arranged, forced, and mercenary marriages still exist in many areas, and incidents of women being persecuted to death continue to occur. If such residual feudal customs and their influence are not overcome through vigorous education among the masses, and offenders are not given necessary punishment, they will not disappear naturally. (2) Many judicial cadres also have residual feudal ideas and have not seriously studied the marriage policy of the People's Government, often regarding the oppression of women as commonplace, not only failing to correct it, but even accommodating the feudal backward ideas of some district and village cadres; a small number of judicial cadres, when handling their own or related marriage issues, fundamentally violate the spirit of the Marriage Law and intentionally or unintentionally become defenders of the feudal marriage system. (3) More commonly, many judicial cadres do not realize that implementing the Marriage Law is one of the anti-feudal revolutionary struggles, and are often obscured by the phenomenon that this struggle occurs within the people, mistakenly believing that this is a struggle of women against men, or even thinking that because the man is a poor peasant or farmhand, it is a struggle that harms poor peasants and farmhands, instead of understanding from the essence that feudal marriage customs are the shackles imposed on the masses by the reactionary feudal rulers of the past. Only by completely destroying these shackles can women gain freedom equal to men, and can men and women be freed from the shackles of arranged, forced, and mercenary feudal marriage systems, and can the enthusiasm of the vast number of women for production be brought into play, thereby jointly building our new democratic society. (4) There are also a few judicial cadres who handle marriage cases untimely and incorrectly because they see them in isolation as personal matters between individuals within the people, and as minor matters that are irrelevant to the overall situation. This is a lack of understanding of the social significance of marriage issues and a lack of understanding that this is an issue related to the interests of thousands of masses. This is a reflection of the bureaucratic and poor work style of lacking a mass perspective and being irresponsible to the masses.

    From the above analysis of the problems that have occurred in the implementation of the marriage policy by judicial cadres, the main problem is that the judicial cadres themselves have feudal ideas and insufficient understanding of the Marriage Law. Therefore, leaders of people's courts at all levels must organize all cadres to seriously study the Marriage Law. First of all, they should recognize the great political significance of implementing the Marriage Law, which is a serious struggle against the remaining feudal forces following the land reform, and it is an indispensable task to liberate women and increase their enthusiasm for production. Secondly, they should also recognize the backbone role of the People's Court in implementing the Marriage Law, and should, under the unified leadership of people's governments at all levels, cooperate with the civil affairs, public security, women's federation, and other departments to conscientiously implement the Marriage Law, in order to reverse the old customs of the feudal marriage system and establish a new atmosphere of the new democratic marriage system. To this end, I hope that judicial cadres in various regions will pay attention to doing the following tasks under such a unified understanding:

    (1) Correctly grasp the marriage policy: It must be clearly recognized that the reason why we attach so much importance to marriage issues is because the family is a social economic unit and a social cultural education unit. If anyone is oppressed in marriage relations, it will inevitably harm their enthusiasm for production and their sense of responsibility for educating their children, which will hinder the development of various construction undertakings in the new society. Therefore, we must abolish the feudal marriage system. However, this extremely unreasonable marriage system has a deep-rooted influence among the broad masses. Abolishing it is by no means something that can be achieved overnight. Therefore, we must recognize the necessity and arduousness of abolishing the feudal marriage system and grasp the marriage policy well in order to achieve the purpose of transforming the old families of feudal oppression and establishing equal and harmonious new families.

    (2) Vigorously publicize the marriage policy: This is an indispensable task for eliminating the feudal ideas of the masses and defeating the feudal marriage system. To do this work well, leadership must attach importance to it, and cadres must work hard. The method of publicizing the marriage policy by the People's Courts in various regions should first of all be to educate the parties involved and the broad masses through trials. At the same time, the content of the publicity should not only be a general explanation of the policy, but more importantly, cultivate and discover vivid examples, that is, use the examples of women who have established new democratic and harmonious families and become active participants in production after being freed from feudal shackles to educate cadres and the masses. For example, Chen Xiaoni in Heshun County, Shanxi, had a long life of pain and depression. After the divorce, she not only actively participated in production herself, but also led a dozen women in the village to actively participate in production. The district and village cadres and the masses also changed their understanding of the Marriage Law. We must discover and use such vivid examples to publicize the Marriage Law. In addition, we can also report work to people's representative conferences at all levels, organize marriage lectures, combine with winter study propaganda, hold exhibitions, and report good and bad examples. The content of the publicity must be comprehensive and correct.

    (3) Severely punish those who infringe upon women's human rights: In the past year, tens of thousands of women across the country have committed suicide or been killed due to marriage problems. This is an intolerable thing in the new society of people's democratic dictatorship. The reason for this phenomenon is that "many people with feudal ideas in many places continue to illegally interfere with the freedom of marriage of men and women, abuse women, and abuse children, and some cadres take a bystander attitude towards such illegal behaviors, or even intentionally condone and protect them, and even commit illegal behaviors that directly interfere with the freedom of marriage of men and women themselves, causing those who are interfered with and abused to not receive the legal and de facto protection they should have." ("Instructions on Checking the Implementation of the Marriage Law" from the State Council of the Central People's Government) In order to prevent the continued occurrence of incidents of women committing suicide or being killed due to marriage problems, cadres or masses who cause such incidents must be given serious sanctions according to the severity of their responsibilities. People's courts in various regions should immediately conduct inspections of such cases in conjunction with relevant departments. Those who have been sentenced should be investigated and dealt with according to law if there are errors; those who have not been handled must be severely investigated and dealt with according to law, so that every offender receives the punishment they deserve. Only in this way can the phenomenon of abuse of women be stopped, and more cadres and masses can be educated by this. For example, after Yushe and Taiyuan in Shanxi organized people's public trials and severely punished Hao Fuquan and Tian Pei, the murderers who resisted divorce and killed women, such cases have not occurred in many counties for a year.

    (4) Improve the trial system and work style: Judicial cadres in various regions must actively and proactively handle marriage cases for the masses, that is, in the trial system, they should not only wait for lawsuits in the organs, sit in court and ask questions, but also take the initiative to support the just demands of women through circuit trials and widely educate the masses; in the method of handling cases, they must follow the mass line, that is, investigate materials from the masses, solicit opinions, and compare and study the materials presented by the parties before making a judgment; inviting local women's federations to participate in jury trials for certain marriage cases is a mature and good experience, and various regions should establish or improve this system more widely; in the time for handling cases, they should strive to be timely, because the masses' marriage problems cannot be resolved correctly in a timely manner, which not only delays production, but often leads to women committing suicide; the People's Court should, in conjunction with the local women's federation, conduct planned periodic visits to the parties involved in the cases handled, give necessary guidance, and cultivate good examples from them.

    The above sections are hereby submitted as a reference for judicial cadres in various regions to study the marriage policy and implement the "Instructions on Checking the Implementation of the Marriage Law" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government.

    认真贯彻执行婚姻法
    中央人民政府司法部部长  史良
    中华人民共和国婚姻法自一九五○年五月一日公布施行以来，全国各级人民法院在各级人民政府统一领导下，组织干部学习，与各有关部门联合向群众进行了宣传；并妥善地处理了许多婚姻案件，从而解除了许多遭受封建婚姻制度压迫的妇女的痛苦，为建立美满的新家庭奠定了良好基础；发挥了青年男女、尤其是妇女的生产积极性。据各地统计，自婚姻法公布以后，各级司法机关受理的婚姻案件均有显著增加：如北京等二十一个大、中城市一九五○年一至四月收案九、三○○件，五至八月收案则为一七、七六三件，即婚姻法公布后四个月的案件比前四个月增加百分之九一。又如河北、平原等省所属十个县城一九五○年一至四月收案九八六件，五至八月收案一、九八二件，后四个月的案件比前四个月增加百分之一○一。又据湖北省一九五一年二月份每一人民法院受理一三·七件，七月份则受理二三·九件，均说明了案件的增加。从主动提出离婚的性别来看，据一九五○年三十二个大中城市和二十个省中三十四个县城的统计（两个月至半年不等）提出离婚者共二一、四三三人，其中女性占百分之七六·五六，男性占百分之二三·四四。从上述统计数字中可以看出：婚姻法颁布施行后，城市与农村收案数均显著增加，尤其在土地改革后，由于农民群众的觉悟提高，对于婚姻自由的要求更是日益增加，而提出婚姻问题者又以妇女为主，可见婚姻法是把广大妇女群众从封建婚姻制度下解放出来的重要武器之一。因而许多获得解放的妇女衷心感谢地说：“共产党把我从地狱里救了出来”，要“登报感谢毛主席”；又说：“人民法院比娘家亲十分”。这些妇女在获得婚姻自由后，改变了过去“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的依赖思想，成为农村、工厂中生产与学习的积极分子，大大地有助于社会经济与文化建设事业。
    各地司法干部在执行婚姻法上，成绩是显著的，但也还存在着问题，主要表现为：（１）不重视或不正确地宣传婚姻法，认为宣传婚姻法是妇联的事，不应该由人民法院管，否则就会“妨碍中心任务”，会“增加麻烦”。也有的把宣传婚姻法当“突击任务”，做了一两次就算完事，做得不广泛，也不深入。还有的片面宣传说：“看着不顺眼的全可以离婚”，完全忽视了婚姻法的积极作用。（２）最普遍的偏向是对妇女的正义要求不予积极支持，甚至对于妇女的被虐待及因婚姻问题被杀或自杀的严重现象，未予严厉制止，对于致妇女于死地的干部或群众处刑过轻，甚至熟视无睹，采取放任态度；（３）在审讯作风上，普遍的问题是处理案件拖延，不少要求离婚的妇女，通过区村政府已是费了许多时日，到了县人民法院又一再被拖延不决。如河南省舞阳县对任如涛离婚案，自一九四八年拖到一九五一年五月尚未解决（五月二十七日河南日报）。有的办案既不向群众调查，也不找有关机关或团体帮助，只是孤立地草率结案。
    某些司法干部在处理婚姻案件中之所以发生上述的偏向或错误，主要的由于在认识上存在着以下的问题：（１）对于封建思想在群众中的潜在力量估计不足。没有认识到虽然封建的土地剥削制度已随着全中国的解放和土地改革运动的完成而崩溃，但封建的婚姻制度及其思想习俗还在群众中有深固的影响，因而重男轻女，视妇女为侍候丈夫公婆的家庭奴隶，以致包办、强迫、买卖的封建婚姻制度在不少地区依然存在着，妇女被迫害至死的事件，不断发生。如果在群众中对于这种残存的封建的习俗及其影响不经大力的教育加以克服，并对犯罪者予以必要的惩处，那是不会自然消灭的。（２）不少司法干部也还有封建残余思想，又未认真地学习人民政府的婚姻政策，往往视妇女受压迫为司空见惯的事，不仅不加以纠正，甚至还迁就某些区村干部的封建落后思想；还有少数司法干部在处理自己或与自己有关的婚姻问题时，根本违反婚姻法的精神，有意或无意地成为封建婚姻制度的维护者。（３）更普遍的是许多司法干部没有认识到贯彻执行婚姻法的性质就是反封建的革命斗争之一，经常被这一斗争发生在人民内部的现象所模糊，误以为这是妇女对男子的斗争，甚至因为男方是贫雇农，就以为这是亏损贫雇农的斗争，而不从实质上去认识封建的婚姻习俗是过去反动的封建统治者所加于人民群众的枷锁，只有彻底摧毁这一枷锁，妇女才能获得与男子平等的自由，男女群众才可能摆脱包办、强迫、买卖封建婚姻制度的束缚，才能发挥广大妇女生产的积极性，从而共同建设我们新民主主义的新社会。（４）也还有少数司法干部对于婚姻案件的处理不及时不正确，是由于把它孤立地看成是人民内部个别人与人间的私事，是无关大局的小事，这是不了解婚姻问题的社会意义，不了解这是有关千千万万群众利益的问题。这是缺乏群众观点，对群众不负责任的官僚主义恶劣作风的反映。
    从以上对于司法干部执行婚姻政策中所发生问题的分析来看，主要的问题是司法干部本身存在着封建思想和对于婚姻法的认识不足，因而各级人民法院的领导者必须组织全体干部认真学习婚姻法。首先应认识贯彻执行婚姻法在政治上的重大意义，它是继土地改革后反封建残余势力的严重斗争，它是解放妇女、提高妇女的生产积极性不可少的工作。其次，还应认识人民法院在执行婚姻法中的骨干作用，应在各级人民政府统一领导下，配合民政、公安、妇联等部门力量，认真贯彻婚姻法，以扭转封建主义婚姻制度的旧习俗，树立新民主主义婚姻制度的新风气。为此，我希望各地司法干部在这样统一的认识下注意做好以下各项工作：
    （一）正确掌握婚姻政策：必须明确认识我们之所以这样重视婚姻问题，是因为家庭是社会经济单位，又是社会文化教育单位，任何人如果在婚姻关系上遭受压迫，必致斫伤他的生产积极性和教育子女的责任心，这对于新社会各种建设事业的开展是有阻碍的，因而我们必须废除封建主义的婚姻制度。但这种极不合理的婚姻制度又在广大群众中有着深固的影响，要废除它决不是一朝一夕所能奏效的，因此，我们必须认识废除封建主义婚姻制度的必要性和艰巨性，并且很好地掌握婚姻政策，以达到改造封建压迫的旧家庭，建立平等和睦的新家庭之目的。
    （二）大力宣传婚姻政策：这是消除群众的封建思想，打垮封建主义婚姻制度不可缺少的工作。要做好这一工作，必须领导重视，干部努力。各地人民法院宣传婚姻政策的方法首先是应该通过审判教育当事人和广大群众。同时，宣传的内容不仅是一般地讲解政策，更重要的是培养和发现生动的事例，即用妇女在解除封建束缚后，建立了新的民主和睦的家庭，成为生产中积极分子的实例来教育干部和群众。如山西和顺县陈小妮过了长年痛苦与消沉的生活，经离婚后，不仅自己积极生产，而且在该村带动了十几个妇女也积极参加生产，区村干部和群众对婚姻法的认识也改变了。我们要发现和运用这样生动的事例来宣传婚姻法。此外，还可向各界人民代表会议报告工作，组织婚姻讲座，结合冬学宣传，举办展览会，通报好坏典型等方式。宣传的内容必须全面而正确。
    （三）严惩侵害妇女人权者：一年来全国各地妇女因婚姻问题自杀或被杀者达数万人，这在人民民主专政的新社会里是一件不能容忍的事。造成这种现象的原因是由于“许多地方带有封建思想的人仍有继续干涉男女婚姻自由、虐待妇女和虐待子女等非法行为，而一部分干部竟对此种非法行为采取袖手旁观的态度，或且有意予以宽纵、袒护，甚至他们本身也作出直接干涉男女婚姻自由的非法行为，致使被干涉者和被虐待者得不到法律上和事实上应有的保护。”（中央人民政府政务院“关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示”）为了防止妇女因婚姻问题自杀或被杀的事件继续发生，对于造成此种事件的干部或群众必须分别责任的轻重予以严肃的制裁。各地人民法院应即会同有关部门进行检查此类案件，已判者，如有错误，应予查明，依法处理；未办者，必须严加追究，依法制裁，务使每个犯罪者都受到应有的惩处。这样才能制止虐害妇女的现象，并以此教育更多的干部与群众。例如山西榆社和太原两地先后组织人民公审并严惩了反抗离婚杀害妇女凶犯郝福全、田培之后，不少县份一年来再未发生此类案件。
    （四）改进审判制度与工作作风：各地司法干部必须主动积极地为群众处理婚姻案件，即在审判制度上不仅只是在机关等待诉讼，坐堂问案，而且应以巡回就审主动为妇女的正义要求撑腰并广泛向群众进行教育；在处理案件的方法上必须走群众路线，即通过向群众调查材料，征求意见，并结合当事人所述材料对照研究再作判决；邀请当地妇联参加陪审某些婚姻案件已是成熟的好经验，各地应更广泛地建立或健全这一制度；在处理案件的时间上应力求及时，因为群众的婚姻问题得不到及时的正确解决，不仅延误生产，而且常有因此招致妇女自杀的；人民法院应会同当地妇联有计划地定期访问已办案件的当事人加以必要的指导，并从中培养出好的典型。
    以上各节，谨提出作为各地司法干部学习婚姻政策及执行中央人民政府政务院所发布“关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示”之参考。
