New Year pictures have been widely promoted throughout the country in the past two years. According to available statistics, in 1950, more than 400 types of New Year pictures were published in 26 regions across the country, with a total circulation of over 7 million copies. This year, 31 regions have published over 580 types of New Year pictures, with a total circulation reaching over 15 million copies, an increase of onefold compared to last year. This year's excellent works, such as Lin Gang's "Zhao Guilan at the Heroes' Meeting," Gu Yuan's "Chairman Mao Talking with Peasants," Zhang Ding's "Children of New China," and Li Qi's "Peasants Visiting Tractors," have all been warmly welcomed by the masses. Although the New Year picture work has achieved some success, there are still many problems that need to be solved urgently. Among them, in addition to the relatively high price and insufficient outreach of distribution work, the main problems are that some works have poor and monotonous themes and content, and the images of characters are not beautiful enough, and thus cannot satisfy the requirements of the broad masses. At the same time, the transformation of old New Year pictures has not been carried out in a planned manner, and the number of old New Year pictures published is still very large. Their content is, in part, propaganda of feudal old morality (such as "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" and "Zhu Zi's Family Precepts") and feudal superstition (such as door gods, kitchen gods, and gods of fortune, prosperity, and longevity); another part, although not very poisonous, lacks educational significance (such as general dramatic historical stories and paintings of court ladies). How to guide old artists in improving old New Year pictures is a problem that urgently needs to be solved at present. However, some regions have not yet started this work; some regions that have started have made inappropriate demands on New Year picture artists, disregarding their limitations in political and technical cultivation, such as requiring them to immediately paint themes of revolutionary struggle and change their original painting methods.

In view of the above situation, in order to further strengthen the creation, publication, and distribution of New Year pictures, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Publications jointly issued the "Instructions on Strengthening New Year Picture Work" on October 20, requiring the cultural and educational and publishing administrative organs of people's governments at all levels, as well as art groups in various places, to pay attention to strengthening the leadership and planning of New Year picture creation when arranging New Year picture work; to fully utilize and give play to the excellent traditions of folk New Year pictures; to unite folk New Year picture artists and organize them to conduct political and professional learning; to adjust the publication plans of the New Year picture publishing industry to overcome certain chaotic phenomena in New Year picture publishing work; and to improve the distribution methods of New Year pictures so that New Year pictures can penetrate into the vast rural areas.

    新年画在全国已有很大的推广
    如何领导旧艺人改进旧年画问题亟待解决
    两年来新年画在全国已有很大的推广。据现有材料统计，一九五零年全国二十六个地区所出版新年画共四百余种，发行七百余万份。今年有三十一个地区出版新年画五百八十余种，发行总数达一千五百余万份，比去年增加一倍。今年的优秀作品如林岗的“群英会上的赵桂兰”，古元的“毛主席与农民谈话”，张仃的“新中国的儿童”，李琦的“农民参观拖拉机”等，均受到群众热烈欢迎。新年画工作虽然获得了一些成绩，但仍存在着不少问题亟待解决。其中除售价较高和发行工作不够深入外，主要问题是有些作品题材内容贫乏单调，人物形象不够美丽，因而不能满足广大群众的要求。同时，旧年画的改造工作尚未能有计划的进行，旧年画出版数量仍然很大，其内容，一部分是宣传封建旧道德（如“二十四孝”、“朱子治家格言”之类）和封建迷信（如门神、灶王爷和福禄寿星之类）；另一部分虽没有太大的毒素，但缺乏教育意义（如一般的戏剧历史故事和仕女画之类）。如何领导旧艺人改进旧年画为目前亟需解决的问题。但这件工作有的地区尚未着手进行；已着手进行的某些地区，则又对年画艺人提出不恰当的要求，不顾他们在政治和技术修养上的限制，如要求他们立刻画革命斗争的题材并改变他们的原有画法等。
    根据上述情况，为进一步地加强年画的创作与出版发行工作，中央人民政府文化部与出版总署于十月二十日联合发出了“关于加强年画工作的指示”，要求各级人民政府文教、出版行政机关及各地美术团体，在布置年画工作时，注意加强年画创作的领导与计划性；充分利用与发挥民间年画的优良传统；团结民间年画艺人并组织他们进行政治和业务的学习；调整年画出版业的出版计划，克服年画出版工作中的某些混乱现象；改进年画的发行方法，使新年画能够深入到广大的农村。
