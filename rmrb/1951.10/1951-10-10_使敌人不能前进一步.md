    Prevent the Enemy from Advancing a Single Step
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Xu Shen
    I joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and became a soldier in a machine gun company. My first battle was on June 1st this year, when we were tasked with holding the 332 Height east of Lianchuan, the most important position of the entire regiment. The regimental commander gave us the task of holding it for one day. This mountain was the highest point in the entire defense line, and below it was a road with the enemy, including seventeen tanks. The enemy was attempting to break through our defense line from here.
    We were on the mountain, which was all rock, but we overcame the difficulties and dug our fortifications. Each of us was determined and put forward the slogan: "Learn from combat hero Wang Yougen!" "We must win glory for our motherland!"
    As soon as the sun came out, the fierce battle began. Enemy planes frantically bombed our position, sending rocks and dust flying, filling the air with smoke. Incendiary bombs landed beside me, setting our clothes on fire, but we calmly stayed in our fortifications. When the enemy concentrated their charge upwards, the platoon leader issued a counter-attack order, and the instructor shouted to us: "Comrades! The time to make merit has come!" We quickly jumped out of our fortifications and rushed to the front line in one breath. I threw six hand grenades that I had prepared in advance, killing several devils, and the enemy retreated. At this time, I was the only one on the front line who was not injured. I comforted the three wounded comrades, telling them to open the grenade caps so they could hit the enemy when they came up. I set up the machine gun myself and tidied up the fortifications. Seeing that the three wounded comrades were not leaving the front line made me even braver and even angrier. I held the machine gun and repelled the enemy's second charge of dozens of people. While I was fighting, I observed, and suddenly I found dozens of enemies rushing up from the right. I told the three wounded comrades: "You monitor the enemies in front, I'll go fight the enemies on the right, we can't let them come up anyway." I left the machine gun to the three wounded comrades, and I myself took several hand grenades and jumped out of the fortifications, lying behind a large rock, waiting for the enemy to come to a place where the hand grenades could hit them before throwing them. I also picked up a rifle and aimed at the enemy, shooting them one by one. When more came up, I threw two hand grenades. That way, the enemy didn't dare to charge again. The enemy didn't know how many people we had. After a while, squad leader Ma Jinshan of the eighth squad and three comrades from the artillery squad came up. The eighth squad leader fired with a submachine gun, I fired with a rifle, and the three comrades from the artillery squad threw hand grenades. In this way, we repelled the enemy's attack once again. Immediately, I crawled towards the squad leader's position. As soon as I moved there, the enemy discovered me and concentrated all their firepower on me. Shells exploded around me, sending sparks flying. I thought to myself, "If I don't bring the machine gun back, our firepower will be too weak, and the position will be in danger if the enemy attacks again. I am a Communist Party member, and I must complete the task no matter what!" I crawled from one bomb crater to another, and finally brought the machine gun back. We fought for another two hours, but the machine gun malfunctioned again. There was no other way, so I picked up the rifle again.
    The enemy attacked us again, concentrating their artillery fire on our position before charging. At this time, the eighth squad leader and several other comrades were wounded and went down. I was the only one left on the position again. I only thought, "As long as I'm here, the position is here." But that rifle had been fired too much, and the barrel was burning hot and needed to cool down before it could be fired again, but how could I take a break at this moment? Just as I was anxious, I suddenly saw that the eighth squad leader had left the submachine gun for me behind. This made me extremely happy. I alternated between using the submachine gun and the rifle, preventing the enemy from advancing a single step.
    When the sun went down, the enemy used planes to bomb our position fiercely. I hurriedly hid under a nearby cliff. The bombing filled the mountain with smoke, and nothing could be seen below. I thought the enemy would take advantage of the smoke to charge, so I hurriedly threw two hand grenades and listened, but there was no movement. After a while, the smoke slowly cleared. It turned out that the enemy was afraid that we would rush down the mountain in the dark, so they used the planes to cover their escape.
    After fighting the enemy for a whole day, the enemy retreated. Our third company's position—the 332 Height—still stood heroically in front of the enemy. The price the enemy paid for using hundreds of troops was six truckloads of their own dead bodies. The sky gradually darkened, and the main force came up. Our third company gloriously completed its task. After the battle, the comrades of the whole company requested commendation for me. I was gloriously awarded the First Class Merit for Resisting America and Aiding Korea and was promoted to machine gun squad leader.

    使敌人不能前进一步
    人民志愿军战斗英雄   徐申
    我参加了中国人民志愿军，在机枪连当战士。第一次参加战斗是今年六月一日，我们担任扼守涟川东山三三二高地，这是全团最重要的一个阵地。团长给我们的任务是坚守一天。这座山是整个防线中的制高点，山下就是公路，公路上是敌人，还有十七辆坦克，敌人企图从这里突破我们的防线。
    我们在山上，山上全是石头，可是我们克服了困难，把工事挖好了。我们每个人都下了决心，提出了口号：“向战斗英雄王有根学习！”“一定为我们祖国争光！”
    太阳刚一出来，激烈的战斗就开始了。敌机疯狂地炸我们的阵地，把阵地炸的飞沙走石，烟雾弥天，汽油弹落在我身旁，把我们衣服都烧着了，但是我们很沉着地守在工事里。当敌人集中往上冲的时候，排长发出了反冲锋命令，指导员向我们喊：“同志们！立功的时候到了！”我们就迅速地跳出了工事，一口气就冲到最前面。我打出了早已准备好的六个手榴弹，炸死了好几个鬼子，敌人就退回去了。这时，最前沿阵地上只剩下我一个没有受伤，我安慰三个受伤的同志，让他们把手榴弹盖打开，敌人上来的时候好揍他，我自己架好了机枪，把工事又整理了一下。看着三个受伤的同志不下火线，使我更勇敢啦，也更红了眼睛啦。我端着机枪打退了几十个敌人的第二次冲锋。我一边打，一边观察，忽然发现右边有几十个敌人冲上来，我告诉三个受伤的同志：“你们监视前面的敌人，右边的敌人我去打，反正咱们不能让他冲上来。”我把机枪留给三个受伤的同志，我自己拿了几个手榴弹跳出了工事，卧在一块大石头后边，等敌人来到手榴弹能打着的地方再打。我又拾起一支步枪瞄准了敌人，一个一个地打，上来的多了就扔两颗手榴弹，这样敌人就不敢再冲啦。敌人也不知道我们有多少人。一会，八班长马金山和炮班的三个同志上来了。八班长用冲锋枪打，我用步枪打，炮班的三个同志扔手榴弹，就这样又一次把敌人进攻打退了。随即我就向班长的阵地上爬去，刚运动到那里，被敌人发现了，一切火力都集中向我打来，炮弹在我的周围爆炸，直爆火星子，我心里想：“不拿来机枪，火力太弱了，敌人再进攻，阵地就危险了，我是一个共产党员，无论如何也得完成任务！”我从这个炸弹坑爬到那个炸弹坑，终于把机枪拿了回来，我们又战斗了两小时，机枪又发生了故障，没办法，我又拿起步枪打。
    敌人又一次地向我们进攻了，在没冲锋以前炮火集中向我们的阵地上打，这时八班长和其他几个同志负了伤下去了。阵地上又只剩下我一个人。我只想：“只要有我就有阵地在”，但那支步枪打的太多了，枪膛滚热，得凉一凉才能再打，可是这会儿怎么能歇一歇呢？正着急，忽然看见八班长把冲锋枪给我留在后边，这下可使我高兴极了，我用冲锋枪和步枪替换着打，使敌人不能前进一步。
    太阳落了山，敌人用飞机猛炸我们的阵地，我急忙隐避到附近的一个石崖下面，炸的满山都是烟，山下边什么也看不见，我想敌人要利用烟雾冲锋，我急忙地扔了两个手榴弹，听了听没有动静，不一会烟慢慢的散了，原来敌人怕天黑我们冲下山去，用飞机掩护着已经逃走了。
    和敌人打了一整天，敌人退了，我们三连的阵地——三三二高地，仍英勇地站在敌人面前，敌人用了数百人的兵力得到的代价是拉走了自己的死尸六卡车。天渐渐的黑了，主力部队上来了，我们三连光荣的完成了任务。战斗结束后，全连同志们给我请功，我光荣地立了抗美援朝一等功，并提升为机枪班班长。
