    Factory Police Who Shot Workers Must Be Severely Punished

    The incident of the factory police shooting and wounding workers at the Chuxian Branch of the China National Grain Corporation, Wuyi Town Grain Mill (see today's "Letters from Readers" column), is an extremely serious incident. The reason its nature is particularly serious is because this incident occurred in a state-owned enterprise and was caused by the erroneous leadership of the factory's leading cadres.

    Regarding this incident, the perpetrator Li Hengshu should bear direct responsibility, and the grain mill's director Guo Bingyuan and warehouse director Zhang Jiazhen should also bear important responsibility. The duty of factory security personnel is to protect state property and the safety of workers, but Li Hengshu actually opened fire on his own class brothers; when he opened fire, he completely took a position hostile to the working class. Such a thing can never be allowed in New China. The director of a state-owned enterprise represents the state led by the working class and manages the workers' own factory. Therefore, he should unconditionally rely on the working class and wholeheartedly serve the country and the workers. However, Guo Bingyuan, the director of the grain mill, arbitrarily dismissed workers and discriminated against and suppressed workers who offered criticism. As a result of this top-down effect, the incident of the factory police shooting and wounding workers occurred. Where has the class viewpoint of someone like Guo Bingyuan gone? On what position is he standing to manage state-owned factories and treat workers?

    The perpetrator of this incident has been handed over to the people's court for legal action, and the relevant responsible personnel have also been dealt with, which is absolutely necessary. We hope that all enterprise leading cadres will pay attention to the lessons of this incident and examine and correct their own positions and viewpoints.

    必须严办枪击工人的厂警
    中国粮食公司滁县支公司乌衣镇营业所碾米厂发生的厂警枪伤工人的事件（见今日本报“读者来信”栏），是一个非常严重的事件。其性质所以特别严重，是因为这一事件发生在国营企业中，而且是由于该厂领导干部的错误领导造成的。
    对于这一事件，凶手李恒树应负直接责任，该碾米厂厂长郭炳元及仓库主任张家珍也要负重要责任。工厂警卫人员的职责是保卫国家财产，保卫工人安全，而李恒树竟向自己的阶级弟兄开了枪；当他开枪的时候，他就完全站到和工人阶级敌对的立场上去了，这种事情在新中国是绝不能允许的。国营企业的厂长，代表工人阶级领导的国家，管理工人自己的工厂，因此，他应该毫无条件地依靠工人阶级，全心全意地为国家和工人办事；而该碾米厂厂长郭炳元，竟随便开除工人，对于提出批评意见的工人，竟加以歧视和打击；上行下效的结果，就发生了厂警枪伤工人的事件。像郭炳元这样的人，他的阶级观点跑到那里去了呢？他是站在什么立场上来管理国营工厂和对待工人呢？
    这一事件的凶手已送人民法院法办，有关肇事人员也都作了处理，这是完全必要的。我们希望所有企业领导干部都注意这一事件的教训，检查与端正自己的立场与观点。
