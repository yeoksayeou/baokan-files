    Workers' Art Creation Should Be Valued
    The "Shanghai Workers' Red May Art Exhibition," jointly organized by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Cultural Bureau, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles Workers' Literary and Art Work Committee, was held in May of this year. Now, a selection of excellent works has been made, and an award ceremony was held on September 16th.
    The awards were based on the ideology, artistry, and audience feedback of the works. From over 720 works, three first prizes, four second prizes, and nine third prizes were selected.
    Holding an exhibition of workers' art is a first for Shanghai. The level of the works demonstrates that the working class's artistic creative talent has been developed in the new society. Their art creations, which combine current events and production movements, have become tools for their self-education. The cultural and educational departments of factories in various regions should systematically lead and encourage workers' creations, so that workers' art creation can fully play its role in publicity and mobilization during production movements.

    应重视工人的美术创作
    上海市人民政府文化局、上海总工会、上海文联工人文艺工作委员会合办的“上海工人红五月美术展览会”在今年五月举行后，现又评选出一部分优秀的作品，于九月十六日召开了给奖大会。
    这次评奖是根据作品的思想性、艺术性，以及观众的意见来进行的，从七百二十几件作品中评选出三个一等奖，四个二等奖，九个三等奖。
    举办工人美术作品展览，在上海还是第一次。作品的水平说明，工人阶级的艺术创造才能在新社会里得到了发挥。他们的结合时事和生产运动的美术创作，成为他们自我教育的工具。各地工厂文教部门应有计划地领导和鼓励工人的创作，使工人美术创作在生产运动当中充分发挥它的宣传鼓动作用。
