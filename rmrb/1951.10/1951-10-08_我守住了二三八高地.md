    I Defended Height 238
    People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Zhang Xuan
    I joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. During the second stage of the fifth campaign on the Korean battlefield, I was a machine gun squad deputy leader, leading a machine gun team to defend Height 238 northeast of Moshiwuli on the right bank of the Han River. At that time, I was a member of the Communist Youth League, but I wanted to strive to be a glorious Communist Party member. Therefore, before the battle, I wrote a letter of determination and gave it to the platoon leader, saying: I want the superiors to assign me the most arduous task, I want to test myself on the battlefield!
    This battle began on the morning of May 19th, when a battalion of the U.S. 25th Division, under the cover of eight aircraft and superior artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on Height 238 defended by my machine gun team. The enemy first used aircraft and artillery, vainly attempting to give us a devastating bombardment. Shells and bombs, tons of steel, poured down on our position. But, how could the enemy's steel destroy our iron will! In the most serious situation, I remained calm and resolute, directing the comrades in the team to fiercely strike the enemy!
    Under the enemy's superior firepower, our machine gun was later blown up, the machine gun shooter Wang Baoying had already heroically sacrificed, and an ammunition feeder had also been seriously injured and taken down. In the position, only myself and another ammunition feeder, Lei Jingquan, continued to fight. At this time, I sent Lei Jingquan to the platoon leader to fetch a submachine gun and five hundred rounds of ammunition. When the enemy advanced to within twenty meters of our position, I used the submachine gun to fire at the enemy, immediately knocking down more than fifty enemies in front of the position. In order to persist in the battle and defeat the enemy, we again fetched ammunition and hand grenades from the platoon leader, and were determined: "As long as we are here, the position cannot be lost!" In the enemy's most frantic attack, when the enemy climbed up the hillside, I aimed with the submachine gun, firing in bursts of three or five rounds, killing and wounding many enemies. Later, the enemy rolled up in clusters. Seeing that they were about to rush up to us, it was no longer possible to rely solely on the submachine gun. At this time, I put down the gun and grabbed a hand grenade, throwing it into the enemy crowd. Following this, I threw four more hand grenades in succession. Lei Jingquan also threw a hand grenade. With several loud explosions, a large gap was blown open in the enemy ranks, and enemies fell one after another.
    In this way, we persisted in the battle for a whole day, defeating the enemy with fewer troops and using light weapons against the enemy's superior firepower, successively repelling the enemy's four attacks. Over one hundred and fifty enemy corpses were displayed in front of our position, and we defended Height 238. After this battle, I was tested, received a meritorious award, and joined the Party, becoming a glorious member of the Chinese Communist Party. This time I returned to the motherland to participate in the National Day celebrations and saw my most beloved Chairman Mao. I felt unspeakably happy. Seeing that the people of the whole country are living a peaceful and quiet life, I more deeply understand the reason for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; seeing the powerful national defense army of the motherland equipped with new weapons, I am even more determined to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism and defend the motherland and world peace. When I return to the Korean front, I will certainly work with my comrades to eliminate more enemies, and strive to see our Chairman Mao again next National Day with even greater achievements.

    我守住了二三八高地
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  张选
    我参加了中国人民志愿军。在朝鲜战场第五次战役的第二阶段，我是机枪班副班长，带领一个机枪组，坚守汉江右岸磨石隅里东北二三八高地。那时我是青年团员，可是，我要争取做一个光荣的共产党员。所以，我在战斗前，写了决心书送给排长，说：我要上级交给我最艰巨的任务，我要在战场上考验自己！
    这次战斗开始在五月十九日清晨，美军二十五师一个营的兵力，在八架飞机和优势炮火的掩护下，向我机枪组守备着的二三八高地发起猛攻。敌人首先使用了飞机、大炮，妄想给我们来一个毁灭性的轰击。炮弹、炸弹，成吨的钢铁，往我们阵地倾泻。可是，敌人的钢铁，那里能够毁灭我们的钢铁意志！在最严重的情况下，我始终坚定沉着，指挥组里的同志，狠狠的打击敌人！
    在敌人优势的炮火下，后来我们的机枪给炸断了，机枪射手王保英已经英勇牺牲，一个压弹手也已经负重伤下去了。在阵地里只有我和另外一个压弹手雷景全继续作战。这时，我便派雷景全去排长那里取来了一枝冲锋枪和五百发子弹，等敌人进到距我们阵地二十余公尺时，就用冲锋枪对准敌人开火，立即阵地前沿倒下了敌人五十余名。为了坚持战斗，打败敌人，我们又从排长那里取来了子弹和手榴弹，并且下定决心：“只要我们在，阵地丢不了！”在敌人最疯狂的一次进攻中，敌人顺着山坡往上爬时，我就用冲锋枪瞄准着打，三发五发地点发，杀伤了许多敌人。后来敌人成疙瘩地滚了上来，眼看就要冲到跟前了，光靠冲锋枪打是不行了，到这时，我就把枪一搁，随手拿起一颗手雷，向敌人群中扔了进去，跟着又接连打出去四个手榴弹，雷景全也随着扔出去了一个手榴弹，几声轰响中，成群的敌人被炸开了一个大缺口，敌人倒下了一片又一片。
    就这样，整整坚持了一天的战斗，我们以少胜多，以轻武器对付敌人的优势火力，先后打垮了敌人的四次进攻。在我们的阵地前沿陈列着敌人的尸体一百五十余具，守住了二三八高地。我经过这次战斗考验之后，立了功，入了党，成为光荣的中国共产党党员。这次我回祖国来参加国庆节观礼，见到了我所最敬爱的毛主席，我心里有说不出的高兴。看到了全国人民都过着和平安静的生活，使我更加体会了为什么要抗美援朝的道理；看到祖国用新式武器装备的强大国防军，使我越发坚定了彻底打垮美帝国主义、保卫祖国和世界和平的决心和信心。我回到朝鲜前线，一定和同志们更多的消灭敌人，争取明年国庆节带着更大的成绩再来见我们的毛主席。
