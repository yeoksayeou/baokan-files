    Publicize the Marriage Law by Utilizing Typical Cases

    The implementation of the Marriage Law is a serious ideological struggle within the people. People's courts at all levels, when handling marriage cases, should give those who violate the Marriage Law and abuse and kill women the punishment they deserve. At the same time, they should seize upon typical marriage cases to carry out extensive publicity and educate the masses and cadres. Only in this way can we quickly stop the continued occurrence of serious incidents in which women are forced to commit suicide or are killed due to abuse, effectively eliminate the influence of feudal ideology and remnants of the feudal marriage system among the masses, and gradually establish a new democratic marriage system.

    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in its instruction on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, has clearly pointed out that judicial organs and marriage registration authorities at all levels should strengthen the publicity of the Marriage Law through specific examples, especially for serious cases with educational significance. After sufficient preparation among the masses, public trials should be held to correctly and comprehensively educate cadres and the people. The experience of many places has proven that this approach is completely correct and one of the most effective ways to educate the masses to implement the Marriage Law. In Cangshan, Shandong; Bishan, eastern Sichuan; and Shanzhou, Zhengzhou, and Huaiyang in Henan, judicial organs have convened mass public trial conferences or people's representative conferences when executing criminals who killed women or sentencing other marriage cases of educational significance, and used slogans, leaflets, comic strips, and blackboards to conduct publicity. This vividly exposed the crimes caused by the remnants of the feudal marriage system to cadres and the masses, deepened their understanding of the Marriage Law, and thus universally aroused the attention of cadres and the masses to the implementation of the Marriage Law, encouraged the fighting courage of oppressed and abused women, and caused some people to transform their feudal and backward ideas. Incidents of oppression and harm to women and other violations of the Marriage Law have been greatly reduced locally.

    At present, the struggle against feudal ideology and remnants of the feudal marriage system and the establishment of a new democratic marriage system has begun in various places. People's judicial organs at all levels should clearly recognize the tasks they shoulder in this major struggle, change the past phenomenon of not publicizing or rarely publicizing the Marriage Law, and, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council, use typical marriage cases and refer to existing experiences, through various methods, together with the Democratic Women's Federation and other relevant organs and organizations, to jointly do a good job in the publicity and education of the Marriage Law, so that this major social reform forms a massive mass movement, thoroughly eliminates feudal ideology, and thoroughly destroys the feudal marriage system.

    利用典型案件宣传婚姻法
    婚姻法的贯彻执行，是人民群众内部的一个严重的思想斗争。各地人民法院在处理婚姻案件时，应该给违犯婚姻法、虐待和残杀妇女的人以应得的惩处；同时还应抓住典型的婚姻案件，大张旗鼓地进行宣传，教育群众和干部。只有这样，才能迅速停止妇女因遭受虐待而被迫自杀或被杀的严重事件的继续发生，并有效地肃清封建思想和封建婚姻制度残余在群众中的影响，逐渐树立起新民主主义的婚姻制度。
    中央人民政府政务院在关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示中已经明确地指出，各级司法机关和婚姻登记机关应该通过具体事例，加强对婚姻法的宣传，特别是对于有教育意义的严重案件，则应在群众中进行充分的准备工作后，举行公审，以便正确而全面地教育干部和教育人民。许多地方的经验已经证明，这种作法是完全正确的，是教育群众贯彻婚姻法的最有效方式之一。山东的苍山，川东的璧山以及河南的陕州、郑州、淮阳等地司法机关，在处决残杀妇女的罪犯或判决其他有教育意义的婚姻案件时，都召开了群众性的公审大会或人民代表会议，并利用标语、传单、连环画和黑板报等进行宣传。这样就鲜明地把封建婚姻制度残余所造成的罪恶暴露在干部和群众的面前，加深了他们对婚姻法的认识，因而普遍引起了干部和群众对贯彻婚姻法的重视，鼓励了受压迫受虐待的妇女的斗争勇气，并使某些人转变了封建落后思想，当地压迫、残害妇女的事件，以及其他违犯婚姻法的现象大为减少。
    目前各地反对封建思想和封建婚姻制度残余，树立新民主主义婚姻制度的斗争已经展开。各级人民司法机关应明确认识到自己在这一重大斗争中所担负的任务，转变过去对婚姻法不宣传、或很少宣传的现象，遵照政务院的指示，运用典型的婚姻案例参照已有的经验，通过各种方法，与民主妇女联合会和其他有关机关、团体一道，共同做好婚姻法的宣传教育工作，使这一重大的社会改革形成声势浩大的群众运动，彻底肃清封建思想和彻底摧毁封建婚姻制度。
