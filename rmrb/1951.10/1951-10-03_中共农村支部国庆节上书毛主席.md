The CCP Rural Branch of Tongtan Village, Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province, Strives for Higher Standards for Party Members

Respected Chairman Mao:

The central visiting group arrived in Tongtan Village on August 30th, and all the party members of the branch and the villagers were very happy. Seeing your personally inscribed words strengthened our will to fight.

Under your wise leadership, and after fourteen years of struggle by all party members and villagers, everything has changed in Tongtan Village. Before the land reform, only thirty-five households in the village had surplus grain; now there are one hundred and ninety-two. In the past, people could not afford homespun clothes and could not get enough millet to eat, but now they wear fine cloth clothes, cover themselves with printed cotton quilts, and eat white flour every few days. Children are all in school. There are no more thieves or lazy people in the village, and even quarrels are much less frequent.

Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the whole village has also launched a patriotic and production increase campaign, and everyone's production has a political goal. The tendency to bury oneself in production in the past, only caring about getting rich and not combining it with political struggle, has been corrected. The branch has consistently implemented ideological leadership in the patriotic production increase campaign, improving the ideological level of party members and the masses. It has also overcome the erroneous ideas of some cadres of "revolutionary success" and "retirement to take a break," ensuring that the production plan for each period is completed on time.

In response to your call to "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," all party members guarantee to do the following five tasks: (1) Respond to the call of the Party and strive for higher standards for Communist Party members. This autumn and winter, all our party members will earnestly study communism and Party history in order to improve their political and ideological level. We will also strengthen political education for all the masses to improve their ideological level; (2) Strengthen the Party's organizational life, strictly enforce Party discipline, regularly conduct criticism and self-criticism, and examine and overcome shortcomings and errors in our work; (3) This autumn, continue to implement the three major calls of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Branch, do a good job in donations and preferential treatment for military families, and review the implementation of the patriotic pact; (4) Recently, we will carry out propaganda and education among all cadres and masses on the report of the central visiting group, the people's democratic dictatorship, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and current affairs; (5) Conscientiously summarize work experience, create new leadership methods, and learn from the advanced experience of other regions to do a good job.

Wishing you eternal health!

The entire membership of the CCP branch, Tongtan Village, Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province.

The CCP Branch of Yantou Village, Shexian County, Hebei Province, Leads the Masses to Organize for Bumper Harvests of Cotton and Wheat

Respected Chairman Mao:

The People's Republic of China is two years old. We have personally seen the good things the People's Government has done for the people under your wise leadership, which are too numerous to count.

Our village's CCP branch, following your instructions, mobilized the masses to organize mutual aid teams and exchange labor for production. This year, the whole village harvested 40,005 catties of wheat, 39 catties more per mu of wheat land than before the war. In response to the call of the People's Government, we expanded cotton fields and experimented with the promotion of Si-character cotton. It is estimated that the whole village can sell more than 20,000 catties of cotton to the state this year. After the Resist America, Aid Korea General Branch issued the call for donations, all party members actively took the lead in donating. Currently, the village has donated more than 1.5 million yuan.

In order to welcome and celebrate National Day, all party members guarantee to do a good job in the three autumn harvests. This winter and next spring, we will mobilize the masses to plant more cash crops. This year, the original seed planting area was 267.5 mu, and next year it will be expanded to 377.5 mu to increase the production of industrial raw materials.

The entire membership of the CCP branch, Yantou Village, Shexian County, Hebei Province.

The CCP Branch of Shiqiao Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, Reports on the Restoration of Sericulture Production

Respected Chairman Mao:

In order to welcome National Day, we represent the people of Shiqiao Township to report to you on the work and production situation in Shiqiao Township.

Since the peasants of Shiqiao Township were allocated land, livestock, and farm implements, their enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. Sericulture, which had been destroyed by the Kuomintang for decades and could not develop, has been restored after the People's Government lent 350,000 Northeast silkworm cocoons. It is estimated that this year we can harvest 3.36 million cocoons, which can be used to produce 2,500 catties of silk, which can be exchanged for 250,000 catties of fine grain.

In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, after patriotic and internationalist education, eighty-two militiamen in Shiqiao Township volunteered to join the Volunteer Army. The whole township also donated 2 million yuan to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people. In terms of preferential treatment for military families, a system of substitute plowing and contracted plowing was adopted, and military families were given priority in plowing. Therefore, the military families of all those who joined the Volunteer Army were very happy and wrote letters to their husbands, sons, and brothers at the front, instructing them to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the American and Li forces.

    中共农村支部国庆节上书毛主席
            山西左权县桐滩村中共支部要为更高的党员条件而斗争敬爱的毛主席：
    八月三十日中央访问团到达桐滩村，支部全体党员和全村群众都非常高兴。看到您的亲笔题字，增强了斗争意志。
    桐滩村在您的英明领导下，经过全体党员和全村群众十四年的奋斗，一切都变了。土地改革前全村有余粮的人家，只有三十五户，现在已有一百九十二户。过去穿不上土布衣服，小米饭吃不饱，现在都穿上了细布衣服，盖上了花布被子，隔几日还吃一顿白面。儿童都上学了。村里再见不到一个小偷和懒汉，就是闹气吵架的事情也少得多了。
    开展抗美援朝运动以后，全村又展开了爱国丰产运动，大家的生产有了政治目标。过去埋头生产，只顾发家致富，没有和政治斗争结合起来的偏向已经纠正。支部在爱国丰产运动中，始终贯彻了思想领导，提高了党员和群众的思想水平。并且克服了某些干部的“革命成功”、“退坡换班”的错误思想，保证了每个时期的生产计划按时完成。
    为了响应您的号召：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，全体党员保证作好以下五项工作：（一）响应党的号召，为更高的共产党员的条件而斗争。今年秋、冬两季，我们全体党员要认真学习共产主义和党史，以提高自己的政治思想水平。并对全体群众加强政治教育，提高群众的思想水平；（二）加强党的组织生活，严肃党的纪律，经常开展批评与自我批评，检查与克服工作中的缺点和错误；（三）秋季继续贯彻抗美援朝总会的三大号召，作好捐献、优军工作，检查爱国公约执行的情形；（四）最近要以中央访问团的报告、人民民主专政、镇压反革命和当前时事在全体干部全体群众中进行宣传教育；（五）认真总结工作经验，创造新的领导方法，并学习其他地区的先进经验，作好工作。
    祝您永远健康！

            河北涉县沿头村中共支部领导群众组织起来棉麦丰收敬爱的毛主席：
    中华人民共和国成立两周年了。俺们亲眼看到在您的英明的领导下，人民政府给人民办的好事，数也数不完。
    俺村中共支部按照您的指示，发动群众组织了互助组，变工生产。今年全村就收麦子四万零五斤，每亩麦地比战前多收三十九斤。又响应人民政府的号召，扩大棉田，试验推广斯字棉，估计今年全村可卖给国家二万多斤棉花。抗美援朝总会的捐献号召发出后，全体党员就积极地带头捐献，现全村捐款已达一百五十多万元。
    为了迎接与庆祝国庆节，全体党员保证作好三秋工作。今冬明春要发动群众多种经济作物，今年原种二六七·五亩，明年要扩大到三七七·五亩，增产工业原料。

            河南鲁山石桥乡中共支部报告恢复了蚕业生产敬爱的毛主席：
    为了迎接国庆节，我们代表石桥乡人民，向您报告石桥乡的工作与生产情形。
    石桥乡农民自分到土地、牲畜、农具后，生产积极性空前提高。被国民党摧残数十年不能发展的蚕业，从人民政府贷给三十五万粒东北茧后，又恢复了。估计今年可收茧三百三十六万粒，能缫丝两千五百斤，可换细粮二十五万斤。
    在抗美援朝运动中，经过爱国主义与国际主义的教育，石桥乡就有八十二个民兵自动报名参加志愿军。全乡还捐献了二百万元，慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民。在优待军属方面，采用了代耕包耕制度，并且作到了先给军属耕种，因此全村参加志愿军的军属都非常高兴，纷纷写信给前方的丈夫、儿子、兄弟，嘱咐他们要坚决地彻底消灭美李军。
