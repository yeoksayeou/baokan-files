    [Reported by this newspaper] The Suiyuan Provincial Industry and Commerce Bureau Director Zhang Qingzhong, Deputy Directors Zhang Guolin, Wang Yingrong, and others were punished by state law for illegally selling gold. On January 13th of last year, when Zhang Qingzhong, Zhang Guolin, Wang Yingrong, and others, from the Suiyuan Provincial Industry and Commerce Bureau, convened a general meeting of the enterprise company under their jurisdiction, they instructed the company to turn over funds four or five times within 1950 in order to obtain a profit of 20 to 25 percent. The company's manager, Gao Ruixin, because of the slow turnover of his cash, proposed to sell the 59 taels, 4 mace, 4 fen, and 7 li of gold he had in storage, and asked for instructions from Zhang Qingzhong, Zhang Guolin, and Wang Yingrong. At that time, Zhang Qingzhong and others did not consider the state's financial policy and immediately expressed their agreement. Gao Ruixin then privately sold the aforementioned gold to speculators. Soon after, Gao Ruixin again asked Zhang Guolin for instructions, intending to use the 540 taels, 0 mace, 8 fen, and 7.9 li of gold frozen in Beijing and Tianjin as working capital for the enterprise company. Zhang expressed his agreement and personally handled the extraction procedures. After the gold was retrieved, Gao Ruixin again discussed the sale with the company's deputy manager, Cheng Ruji, and Cheng asked Zhang Qingzhong for instructions, who again agreed to the sale. After the Provincial People's Bank discovered this matter, it sent a letter to inquire. Zhang Guolin did not take it seriously. Later, because the bank pursued the matter closely, he turned over the remaining 168 taels, 5 mace, and 8.9 fen of gold. Apart from what was recovered, a total of 411 taels, 7 mace, 3 fen, and 7 li of gold were sold in two transactions. This case was delayed for several months without any result. In July of last year, the Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank reported the matter to the Suiyuan Provincial People's Procuratorate. The Procuratorate considered the enterprise company's illegal sale of gold to be a serious illegal act that undermined the state's financial policy and filed a public prosecution with the Suiyuan Provincial People's Court. During the trial, Zhang Qingzhong and others confessed to participating in the illegal sale of gold. The court then sentenced Zhang Qingzhong to two years in prison with a two-year reprieve in January of this year; Zhang Guolin was sentenced to one year in prison with a one-year reprieve; other relevant personnel were sentenced separately according to the severity of their circumstances; and the enterprise company under the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government was fined.
    Liu Shaojie, the Deputy Magistrate of Sa County in Suiyuan Province, committed serious crimes of corruption. The Provincial People's Court has sentenced him to death. Liu Shaojie previously served as a section chief in the Finance Department of the puppet Suiyuan Province, and was later transferred to serve as the puppet Magistrate of Sa County. After the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan, the Sa County government was reorganized, and the accused was appointed as the Deputy Magistrate of the county. When Liu Shaojie was the puppet Magistrate of Sa County, he colluded with local bullies and unscrupulous merchants to embezzle and encroach on the property of the people. After liberation, the accused did not repent, but instead used various despicable means, such as embezzling public grain, stealing and selling public grain and horses, misappropriating public funds for profit, arbitrarily imposing fines, and accepting bribes, to commit large-scale corruption. In total, he embezzled 1.5 million yuan in RMB, 1,200 silver dollars, 200,050 catties of grain, more than 20 bolts of white cloth, and 70 taels of opium. After the incident, the accused again colluded with unscrupulous merchants in an attempt to bribe the personnel who came to investigate in order to escape criminal responsibility. The above-mentioned criminal acts of the accused were verified by the Suiyuan Provincial People's Procuratorate with the assistance of the Provincial Supervisory Committee and the local Public Security Bureau, and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Procuratorate filed a public prosecution with the Provincial People's Court. The accused confessed to all the criminal facts. After trial by the Suiyuan Provincial People's Court, and with the approval of the Supreme People's Court, the accused was sentenced to death in April of this year.

    绥远省人民政府严惩渎职贪污罪犯
    省工商厅厅长支持所属出售黄金被处徒刑
    萨县副县长刘绍杰贪污罪行严重被处死刑
    【本报讯】绥远省工商厅厅长张庆中、副厅长张国林、王映荣等违法出售黄金，受到国家法律制裁。去年一月十三日，绥远省工商厅厅长张庆中、副厅长张国林、王映荣，在该厅所属企业公司召开全体会议时，指示该公司在一九五○年内须周转资金四、五次，以便获利百分之二十至二十五。该公司经理高瑞新以其现金周转不灵，拟出售所存之五十九两四钱四分七厘黄金，请示张庆中、张国林、王映荣。当时张庆中等均未考虑国家金融政策，即表示同意。高瑞新即将前项黄金私自卖给投机商人。不久高瑞新又请示张国林，拟将该公司在北京、天津两地冻结之黄金五百四十两零八钱七分九厘，作为企业公司的活动经费，张表示同意，并亲自办理提取手续。黄金取回后，高瑞新又与该公司副经理程汝吉商讨出售事宜，并由程请示张庆中，张又同意出售。该省人民银行发觉此事后，即去信查询，张国林未予重视，后因银行追查甚紧，始将剩余黄金一百六十八两五钱八分九厘交出。除追回者外，前后两次共计售出黄金四百一十一两七钱三分七厘。此案曾拖延数月，毫无结果。去年七月间，人民银行绥远省分行向绥远省人民检察署检举，该署认为企业公司非法出售黄金，乃是破坏国家金融政策的严重违法行为，即向绥远省人民法院提起公诉。在审讯中，张庆中等对参与非法出售黄金事均供认不讳。该院遂于今年一月间判处张庆中徒刑二年，缓刑二年；张国林徒刑一年，缓刑一年；其他有关人员，均按情节轻重，分别处刑；对绥远省人民政府所属企业公司则科以罚金。
    绥远省萨县副县长刘绍杰贪污罪行严重，该省人民法院已处以死刑。刘绍杰，曾任伪绥远省财政厅科长等职，后调任萨县伪县长。绥远和平解放后，萨县政府改组，该犯任该县副县长。刘绍杰在任伪萨县县长时，即勾结劣绅、奸商共同贪污，侵占人民财产。解放后，该犯仍未痛改前非，反用各种卑鄙手段，如侵吞公粮、盗卖公粮、公马、挪用公款谋利、任意罚款、接受贿赂等，大事贪污，前后共计贪污人民币一百五十万元、银洋一千二百元、粮食二十万零五千斤、白市布二十余匹、大烟七十两。事发后，该犯复勾结奸商，企图向前往调查的人员行贿，逃脱罪责。该犯以上犯罪行为，经绥远省人民检察署，在省监察委员会和当地公安处的协助下查明属实后，即由绥远省人民检察署向该省人民法院提起公诉。该犯对犯罪事实，均供认不讳。经过绥远省人民法院审理，并于今年四月间判决，经最高人民法院批准，处该犯以死刑。
