    Wishing Teachers Success in Learning
    Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University
    The organized and planned political study undertaken by teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities this time is a new phenomenon in New China. Since liberation, everyone has valued learning and demanded learning, and various units have continuously held studies and discussions, but this is the first time that teachers from entire universities and colleges have been organized to study together. This is of great significance for transforming our thinking and running New Democratic education well. We must not only value this study, but we must also be determined to study hard.
    This study is obviously different from the study at the time of the initial liberation. We have gone from not understanding politics to participating in politics, from not understanding the Communist Party to loving the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and from being arrogant to being humble in learning and self-criticism. Compared with before, there has indeed been great progress. Today, when we talk about learning, we hope to go further and be more thorough on the basis of the original progress. In the past, we were in the first grade, and now we should be in the third grade. In reality, we can only be in the third grade, because we are deeply influenced by the old society and old ideas, and we are limited by conditions; although there has been some progress, we still cannot reach the required standards, nor can we keep up with the great leap forward of New China, nor can we immediately meet and conform to the people's requirements of us. This is still in terms of most people who are willing to work hard and make progress. As for some people whose thinking is still vague and fundamentally not much different from before, the problem is even more serious.
    As a people's teacher in New China, especially a teacher in higher education, it is glorious to shoulder the task of cultivating new Chinese construction talents with both moral integrity and ability, and strong physique, but the responsibility is very heavy, and the work is very arduous. The motherland requires the younger generation to have a firm working-class standpoint and a high degree of communist thought. If we, as people's teachers, do not have such a standpoint and such thought, how can we shoulder the task of educating the youth of New China? Therefore, we must use the spirit of revolution to arm our minds with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to transform ourselves, and to send the old thoughts and old styles together into the grave.
    Some people say that it is easy to transform elementary school teachers, more difficult for middle school teachers, and especially difficult for university teachers. This shows that the older you get, the heavier your baggage is, and the more difficult it is to transform your thinking. The baggage of young people is lighter than that of older people, and the baggage of workers and staff is lighter than that of professors, so the transformation of big intellectuals is more difficult than that of small intellectuals, and the transformation of old intellectuals is more difficult than that of young intellectuals. But precisely because it is difficult, we must work harder. We see the young students and staff in the school making rapid progress day by day. If we, as teachers, do not make progress, or make progress very slowly, how can we improve our teaching content and teaching methods? How can we lead students' learning? Not only is the individual affected, but the improvement of the school system cannot be promoted, or even becomes an obstacle.
    Our common problem as intellectuals is arrogance. We think we are great, we put on airs, and we usually look down on the vast number of workers and peasants. When we pick up a pen, we say that "peddlers and hawkers, cart pullers and porters" are illiterate. In fact, what is so great about knowing a few more words and reading a few more books? Moreover, the so-called intellectuals are not necessarily completely knowledgeable. Chairman Mao said that those who only have book knowledge can at most be considered half an intellectual, which is most appropriate. In the past, those who had the opportunity to go to school were always landlords or bourgeoisie, and very few were workers and peasants. In "Mingru Xue'an" of more than sixty volumes, there are only one woodcutter, one farmer, and one potter. Now, it must also be very rare to find university teachers who are truly from worker or peasant backgrounds. Precisely because they come from the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, whether they are trained domestically or returned from studying abroad, they always have some feudal consciousness and comprador ideology, and they show a sense of superiority everywhere, becoming a special figure in society. Although it has been more than two years since liberation, and we have gone through some learning, everyone is on the road to progress, but there are still a very few people who often do not attend meetings and discussions, are not interested in political study, and do not care about current affairs. They come to class and leave after class. No matter how you mobilize or publicize, I have my own ideas anyway. Some people think that they have certain knowledge, they have their own set of things. The old society wanted to use me, and the new society cannot do without me. Even individual people think, I have to teach whether I study politics or not, I have to teach anyway, I am not an object of suppression anyway. These people are not only not enthusiastic about learning, but also have a sense of resentment, thinking that it is an extra burden; they all look down on learning, thinking that I have heard these theories a long time ago, there is nothing new. These people have too much intellectual airs. If they do not change, it is impossible to hope that they will have a clear understanding of the revolution and make a great contribution to the construction of New China. It is also impossible for them to teach the courses they think they are good at well. Tracing back to the source, it is always due to the old thoughts and old styles that are haunting them, arrogance, and unwillingness to be humble. Therefore, although living in a great era of earth-shaking changes, they still cannot recognize the nature of New China's society, cannot change the old outlook on life, and cannot establish the concept of serving the people. How can such a style shoulder the glorious task of educating the younger generation? To be honest, the motherland will not allow teachers to hold this attitude any longer, and the young students do not need such people to be teachers.
    There are also some people who also study when they study. They think that since they are teaching me to study, this is the government's order, everyone is studying, and I am also studying. He studies to cope with the call, to complete the task, and does not relate to his own thoughts. Of course, if you study for a long time, your thinking will also improve, but this kind of learning attitude is not correct enough, the progress must be very slow, which is an obstacle to our transformation of thinking, and should also be corrected.
    I am an old intellectual, and also an old intellectual, who has been influenced by the old society for a long time. Although I have been constantly studying for more than two years, the progress has always been very slow. After all, I am old, and I am much worse than young people in accepting new things, not to mention my ears, eyes, and spirit. However, I believe in the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Faced with the unprecedented brilliant achievements of the motherland, I am excited and determined to strengthen my learning. After I participated in the land reform in Sichuan this time, my thinking has undergone great changes. I deeply feel that the knowledge I learned from books in the past must be re-evaluated. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, many of his words hit my problems right on the mark. It really scratched my itch, and I felt even more that I had to thoroughly clean up my thoughts, be honest, and start learning from scratch. I plan to write another article to review these issues, and I will not go into details here.
    In short, New China is leaping forward every day. As people's teachers, we should quickly catch up and serve New China. I hope that our university teachers will unite and everyone will be determined to transform themselves, improve themselves, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to cultivate new Chinese construction talents with both moral integrity and ability and a strong physique! I wish our learning a successful victory!

    祝教师学习成功
    辅仁大学校长  陈垣
    这次北京、天津高等学校教师有组织有计划地展开政治学习，是新中国的一种新气象。解放以来，大家重视学习，要求学习，各个单位都不断举行过学习和讨论，但是整个高等学校教师组织起来，共同学习，这还是第一次。这对于改造我们的思想，办好新民主主义教育，是有很重大的意义的。我们不仅要重视这一学习，同时我们必须下决心好好去学习。
    这次学习，和刚解放时候的学习，很显然的有些不同。我们已从不了解政治到参预政治，从不明白共产党到热爱共产党和毛主席，从自高自大到虚心学习、自我批评。比起以前，确是有了很大的进步。今天我们来谈学习是从原有的进步基础上希望更进一步，更彻底一些。从前我们是一年级，现在我们应该是三年级了。实际也只能上三年级，因为我们受旧社会旧思想的影响很深，条件上受了限制；虽然有些进步，还不能达到应有的标准，也还不能赶上新中国伟大的飞跃进步，也还不能够马上满足和符合人民对我们的要求。这还是就大部分肯努力有进步的人而言，至于有些人的思想还是模模糊糊的，根本和从前没有多少分别，那样问题就更严重了。
    作为一个新中国的人民教师，尤其是高等学校的教师，负担起培养德才兼备、体魄强健的新中国建设人才的任务，是光荣的，但是责任很重大，工作很艰巨。祖国要求青年一代具备坚决的工人阶级立场，有高度共产主义思想，我们这些做人民教师的，自己没有这样的立场，这样的思想，怎么能够负担起教育新中国青年的任务？所以我们必须用革命的精神，以马列主义、毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，来改造自己，把旧思想、旧作风一起送进坟墓里去。
    有人说，小学教师容易改造，中学教师比较难，大学教师尤难。这说明年岁愈大，包袱愈重，思想愈不容易改造。年轻人的包袱比年纪大的人轻，职工的包袱又比教授们轻，所以大知识分子的改造比小知识分子难，老知识分子的改造又比少知识分子难。但正因为难，我们更得加倍努力。我们眼看着学校里的青年同学和职工们都一天一天迅速地进步。如果我们作教师的不进步，或进步很慢，怎样改进我们的教学内容和教学方法？怎样来领导同学的学习呢？不但个人受到影响，而且对学校制度的改善，也不能推动，甚或成为障碍。
    我们知识分子的通病，就是自高自大，觉得自己了不得，架子搭起半天高，平日看不起广大的工人农民，拿起笔来就说“贩夫走卒、引车卖浆之流”不识字。其实多识几个字，多念几部书，有什么了不得。况且所谓知识分子，知识并不见得完全，毛主席说只有书本知识的人，至多算得一个半知识分子，最是恰当。从前能有机会上学的总是地主阶级或资产阶级，工农阶级绝少。一部明儒学案六十多卷，只有樵夫、田夫、陶匠各一人。现在大学的教师中要找出真正工人农民出身的，一定也极少。正因为出身地主阶级、资产阶级，不论在国内培养出来的，或从国外留学回来的，总多少有些封建意识、买办思想，处处表现优越感，在社会里成为一种特殊人物。虽然解放二年多，也经过一些学习，大家都向前进的路上走，可是仍然有极少数的人，经常不出席开会讨论，对政治学习无兴趣，对时事不关心，上课便来，下课便走，尽管你怎么动员，怎么宣传，我反正有我的主意。又有一些人认为自己有一定的知识，有自己的一套，旧社会要用我，新社会也离不了我。甚至个别的人想，学政治也得要我教书，不学政治也得要我教书，反正我不是镇压对象。这些人不但不热心学习，而且还有反感，认为是一种额外负担；又都看不起学习，觉得这些理论，我早已听见过，没有什么新鲜。这些人的知识分子架子太大了，如果不转变，希望他们对革命有清楚的认识，对新中国建设有很大的贡献，是不可能的，就是要他教好他自命不凡的课业，也是不可能的；追根溯源，总由于旧思想、旧作风作祟，自高自大，不肯虚心。因此，虽然生活在翻天覆地的伟大时代，仍然不能认清新中国社会的性质，改变不了旧的人生观，建立不起为人民服务的观点。像这样的作风，怎么能负担起教育青年一代的光荣任务呢？老实说，祖国是不会允许教师们再抱这种态度的，青年同学们也不需要这样的人来做教师的。
    另有一些人，学习时也学习，他们想既然教我学习，这是政府的命令，大家都学习，我也学习。他学习是为了应付号召，为了完成任务，不联系自己的思想。当然学习久，思想也会得到进步，但是这种学习态度，不够端正，进步一定很迟缓，对于我们改造思想有阻碍，也是应该纠正的。
    我是一个旧知识分子，又是一个老知识分子，受旧社会的薰陶很久。这二年多，虽然不断的学习，总是进步很慢。究竟岁数大了，接受新鲜事物，比年青人差得多，耳目精神，更不用说。可是，我相信了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，面对着祖国的史无前例的辉煌成就，我欢欣鼓舞地下决心要加强学习。我这次到四川参加土地改革以后，思想上起了很大的变化，深感从前那些在书本上得来的知识，都要从新估定。又听了周总理的报告，有好些话正中我的毛病，真是搔着痒处，我更觉得要彻底清理自己的思想，老老实实，从头学起。关于这些问题，我预备另写文章检讨，不在这里絮述了。
    总之，新中国天天在飞跃前进，作为人民教师的我们，应该快步追上去为新中国服务。我希望我们大学教师团结起来，人人下决心改造自己，提高自己，学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，为培养德才兼备、体魄强健的新中国建设人才而努力！预祝我们学习的胜利成功！
