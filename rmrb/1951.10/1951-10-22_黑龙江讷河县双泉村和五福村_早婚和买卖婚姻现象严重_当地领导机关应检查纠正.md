    Serious Premature Marriage and Arranged Marriage Phenomena in Shuangquan Village and Wufu Village, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province - Local Leading Organs Should Inspect and Correct

    To the Editor:
    In Shuangquan Village and Wufu Village, Sixth District, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, premature marriage and arranged marriage phenomena are currently serious.

    Due to my work, I conducted a simple investigation. In Yongfengtun Elementary School, Shuangquan Village, there are 33 female students, the oldest being 17 and the youngest being 9, with the majority being under 12 years old. Among them, 28 have already been engaged. There are 37 male students, roughly the same age as the female students, and 17 of them are engaged, with 2 already married (Youth League members). They are all very distressed after marriage. In Shuangquan Village, one woman married at 14 and gave birth at 15, nearly dying during childbirth.

    In addition, these two villages also have arranged marriages. The families of Chi Weide and Wang Dexin in Wufu Village have been able to save 30 to 40 *shi* of grain per household each year since the land reform, but it has all been used up for the marriages of several brothers. Due to arranged marriages, production has been affected and living standards have declined in 16 households in Yongfengtun, Shuangquan Village alone, accounting for 47% of all households experiencing declines. This is a very serious situation!

    The leading cadres of the district and villages have not earnestly implemented the Marriage Law, and have not taken effective measures to address premature marriage and arranged marriage in the area. When I spoke to Comrade Wan Xinglong, the former Youth League secretary of Shuangquan Village and current Youth Affairs Cadre of the District Committee, about this matter, he said, "We've known about these situations for a long time, but what can we do?" He also said that public opinion generally believes that it is impossible to get a wife without spending money, and that advocating for compliance with the Marriage Law is only possible for "city people." He said that even the village cadres themselves cannot act in accordance with the Marriage Law. I believe that to correct the phenomenon of premature marriage and arranged marriage in the area, we must first educate the leading cadres of the district and villages about the Marriage Law; second, conduct an education on the Marriage Law for all members within the Youth League; and third, vigorously publicize the Marriage Law to the masses through propaganda networks and various meetings.
                                    Han Jingxiang

    Editor's Note: The "Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China" stipulates that "it is forbidden for anyone to extort property in connection with marriage," and that "men must be 20 years old and women 18 years old to marry." The facts of premature marriage and arranged marriage pointed out in reader Han Jingxiang's letter violate the provisions of the Marriage Law and should be taken seriously by the leading organs of the area. In these areas, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the Marriage Law, strictly inspect and resolutely correct unreasonable phenomena.

### 黑龙江讷河县双泉村和五福村  早婚和买卖婚姻现象严重  当地领导机关应检查纠正

    黑龙江讷河县双泉村和五福村
    早婚和买卖婚姻现象严重
    当地领导机关应检查纠正编辑同志：
    黑龙江讷河县六区双泉村和五福村，目前严重地存在着早婚和买卖婚姻的现象。
    因工作之便，我作了一个简单的调查。在双泉村永丰屯小学，有女生三十三人，最大的十七岁，最小的九岁，大多数是十二岁以下。她们中已有二十八人订了婚。男生三十七人，年龄约同女生，他们中也有十七人订了婚，两人结了婚（青年团员）。他们在结婚后，都是很痛苦的。在双泉村，一个女的十四岁结婚，十五岁生孩子，她在生产时险些死了。
    此外，这两个村还存在着买卖婚姻。五福村池渭德、王德新两户，在土地改革以后每年每户可余粮三十石到四十石，但都因兄弟几人结婚而用完了。因买卖婚姻，致使生产受到影响，生活下降的，仅双泉村永丰屯就有十六户，占整个下降户的百分之四十七。这是何等严重的情况！
    当地区、村领导干部，还未认真贯彻执行婚姻法，对当地早婚和买卖婚姻还没有采取有效的措施。我与双泉村前青年团书记、现任区委青年干事万兴隆同志谈起这件事时，他说：“这些情况早就知道了，那有什么办法？”他又说，群众的舆论一致认为，说媳妇不花钱是不行的，提倡按婚姻法办事，只有“城里人”可能。他说，连村干部本身，也不能依照婚姻法办事。我认为：要纠正该地早婚和买卖婚姻现象，首先应对该地区、村领导干部好好进行婚姻法的教育；第二、在青年团内部对全体团员进行一次婚姻法的教育；第三、通过宣传网、各种会议，向群众大力宣传婚姻法。
                                    韩景湘
    编者按：“中华人民共和国婚姻法”规定“禁止任何人借婚姻关系问题索取财物”，并规定“男二十岁，女十八岁，始得结婚”。读者韩景湘来信中所指出的早婚和买卖婚姻的各种事实是违反婚姻法的规定的，应当引起该地领导机关严重注意。在这些地区必须大力宣传婚姻法，严格检查并坚决纠正不合理的现象。
