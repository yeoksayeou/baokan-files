Farmers' Mutual Aid Teams and cotton-producing area farmers across the country are enthusiastically responding to the challenge issued by the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team. Twenty-one farmer representatives from the Shijiazhuang cotton-producing area, who are attending the Second Session of the Third People's Representative Conference of Shijiazhuang City, jointly issued a challenge letter to the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team. The challenge letter puts forward the following guarantees: First, actively publicize the state's cotton purchasing policy and educate farmers to sell all cotton, except for the necessary wadding cotton, to the state. Second, educate farmers to ensure the quality of cotton; ensure picking, drying, and delivery promptly; ensure the timely picking and drying of cotton for revolutionary martyrs and military families; and ensure that all village representatives, mutual aid teams, and cooperative members in the suburbs sell all their cotton to the state by mid-November. Third, by the end of December, ensure that 50% of the farmers in the suburbs are organized into cooperatives (currently, cooperative members in the suburbs account for only 28% of the total population), so that cotton farmers can deliver cotton to the state in a planned way through cooperatives. Fourth, ensure that cotton farmers throughout the suburbs universally conduct field selection of seeds, achieving individual plant selection and seed selection, and preserving pure "Si" cotton seeds. Fifth, mobilize all 85,000 farmers in the suburbs to ensure that all pledged donations of 720.87 million yuan for the purchase of airplanes and cannons are paid in full by the end of October.

The Jin Yangen Mutual Aid Team of Yancang Township, Nanhui County, and all cotton farmers in Baojia Village, Jiading County, in the Southern Jiangsu District, also responded to the challenge from the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team. In addition to guaranteeing prompt sales and good cotton quality, the conditions for the challenge proposed by the Jin Yangen Mutual Aid Team specifically stipulate: First, collective cotton sales to the cooperative every five days. Second, each person retains a maximum of only 2.5 jin of wadding cotton, and all remaining cotton is sold to the state. Third, repay government agricultural loans before October 20th. Fourth, maintain the existing cotton field area next year and switch to planting "Dai" cotton; purchase one sprayer and one duster by the end of this year to protect next year's cotton from pests. Fifth, prepare cotton seeds well by the end of this year, and carry out screening and seed selection. Sixth, organize visits to the county farm and successfully test strip-sowing plows before the end of October; switch to strip sowing for wheat planting this autumn so that cotton can be planted in time next year. In a letter written to the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team at a general meeting of all cotton farmers in Baojia Village, Tangnan Township, Jiading County, they stated that they guarantee to use yellow cotton for all wadding cotton. Of the 42,250 jin of local cotton already harvested, all will be sold to the state except for 2 jin of lint cotton per person for winter clothing. The entire village's 140 mu of improved cotton, which can yield 14,000 jin of seed cotton, will be sold entirely to the state without retaining a single boll, and the money will be deposited in the People's Bank. The letter further stated that in addition to expanding the working group to speed up picking and drying, they have also sent militia to protect the cooperative's warehouse, ensuring that no reactionary elements damage a single boll of cotton.

He Aji's Mutual Aid Team, led by first-class agricultural labor model hemp farmer from Hang County, Zhejiang Province, also responded to the challenge from the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team. In their challenge letter, they guarantee that in addition to earnestly fulfilling the pre-sale contract signed with the cooperative and selling 16,700 jin of ramie to the state, they will also sell all 1,600 jin of ramie not included in the contract to the state, based on the current production situation. They also guarantee that the above-mentioned quantity of ramie will be completely peeled and delivered to the cooperative before October 20th.
