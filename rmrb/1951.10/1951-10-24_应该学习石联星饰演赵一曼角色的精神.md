    Should Learn the Spirit of Shi Lianxing's Portrayal of Zhao Yiman
To the Editor:
  After reading Shi Lianxing's "Sincere Thanks," an article by the winner of the Outstanding Acting Award at the Fifth International Film Competition, in the "Cultural Life" section of the People's Daily on October 9th, I was deeply moved. In the past, when I saw Shi Lianxing portraying Zhao Yiman in the film "Zhao Yiman," the scene of her holding a gun in her right hand and shouting loudly, leading the people to advance, remained in my mind for a long, long time. At that time, I wondered: why could Shi Lianxing portray Zhao Yiman so profoundly and vividly? Today, after reading her article, I realized that her process of portraying the role of Zhao Yiman was a process of experiencing life and transforming herself. She not only studied and understood the heroic and tenacious spirit of the martyr Zhao Yiman, but also studied and understood the fighting spirit of outstanding heroes such as Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya of the Soviet Union and Julius Fučík of Czechoslovakia. This creative method and spirit are correct, and it answered my initial question. I believe that Shi Lianxing's method and spirit of learning and creation are the necessary conditions for being a good people's actor.

    应该学习石联星饰演赵一曼角色的精神编辑同志：
  我读了十月九日人民日报“文化生活”栏内第五届国际电影比赛会优等演技奖获得者石联星的“衷心的感谢”一文后，深深受到感动。过去我在“赵一曼”的影片里看到石联星饰的赵一曼，右手持枪大声呐喊，领导人民群众向前进的一个场面，很久很久留在我的心里。我当时想：为什么石联星会那样深刻地、生动地演赵一曼呢？今天我读了她的这篇文章，才知道她的饰演赵一曼角色的过程，就是她体验生活、自我改造的过程。她不但学习、体会赵一曼烈士的英勇顽强，而且学习、体会苏联丹娘、捷克伏契克等等优秀的英雄人物的战斗精神。这种创作方法和精神是正确的，它解答了我当初的疑问。我认为石联星学习和创作的方法及精神，是作一个好的人民演员所应有的条件。

  编者按：石联星同志的“衷心的感谢”一文发表后，我们收到读者赵起、笑平、王密等来信，认为石联星的创作方法和精神是好的。因各信内容类似，所以这里只选登了赵起的来信。
