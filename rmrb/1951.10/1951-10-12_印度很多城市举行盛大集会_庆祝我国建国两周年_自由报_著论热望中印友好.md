    "Free Press" Publishes Article Eagerly Hoping for Sino-Indian Friendship
    [Xinhua News Agency] The people of India are enthusiastically celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Many cities held grand celebration rallies.
    On September 30, the people of Calcutta held a grand rally to celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the auspices of the India-China Friendship Association. The editor-in-chief of the famous Bengali newspaper "Epoch-Making Times," Mukerjee, served as chairman of the celebration.
    Amidst warm cheers, Chinese Consul General Yao Zhongkang delivered a speech to the celebration, emphasizing the importance of friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Indian peoples for safeguarding peace and freedom in all of Asia.
    Chairman Mukerjee of the celebration said at the meeting: In the past two full years, China has undergone amazing changes. China has not only eliminated famine but has also promptly provided food aid to India, saving millions of starving people.
    He concluded: "We pay tribute to China because it has provided us in India with a brilliant example."
    Famous Indian journalist Ghosh, General Secretary of the All-India Students Federation Dang, Mrs. Mokherjee, who recently returned from a visit to China, Calcutta overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen, and other prominent figures spoke at the meeting to express their congratulations.
    On October 1, the people of Bombay held a celebration at the Kama Hall under the auspices of the India-China Friendship Association. Many speakers mentioned the glorious achievements of the People's Republic of China and warmly praised the creative efforts of the Chinese people.
    The Communist Party and other left-wing parties held a celebration in Bombay on October 1. Vice Chairman Mirajkar of the All-India Trade Union Congress served as chairman of the meeting. The meeting passed a resolution amidst warm cheers for the friendship of the working people of India and China, congratulating the Chinese people on their victory in the struggle against the forces of imperialist reaction.
    On October 1, the Bihar Provincial India-China Friendship Association held a celebration in Patna, and in an extremely warm atmosphere, passed a resolution congratulating the people of New China and their beloved Chairman Mao Zedong.
    Citizens of Ahmedabad in Bombay Province and Patiala (in the Patiala and East Punjab States Union) also held similar celebrations. At the celebration in Ahmedabad, prominent peasant leader Yagnik said: "We should unequivocally declare that China and the Soviet Union, which have never invaded India in history, are our friends, and we will support them in resisting the imperialist conspiracy to destroy them."
    [Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 6th] The Bengali "Free Press," published in Calcutta, India, published an editorial on October 1 entitled "Long Live," warmly celebrating our National Day.
    The editorial first retraced the history of Asia's suffering under imperialist humiliation for the past two hundred years, explaining that October 1 is not only a memorial day for the Chinese people but also for the entire Asia, especially the Indian people.
    The editorial said: The hopes of the people of the world for China have been realized under the leadership of the leaders of the Chinese government. The feudal exploitation suffered by farmers has ended, and they have received land. Food can not only meet the needs of the people of the whole country, but also, when Asian lands under imperialist enslavement suffer famine, and the United States demands to exchange food for indentures, it unreservedly transports food to the hungry people of its neighbor India without delay.
    The editorial then pointed out: The eyes of Asian patriots are all on New China. New China has also proved that the Chinese people will always be the sentinels of peace in Asia. The solidarity of Korea and China, the solidarity of freedom-loving Asia, has the power to eliminate the violence of imperialism that provokes war. Inspired by the ideals of freedom, the Chinese People's Volunteers are resisting the threat to the freedom of all of Asia with unparalleled courage. This is why China is the leader of Asia. This is why the People's Republic of China has received a sincere and unhesitating welcome from the oppressed colonial peoples.
    The editorial concluded: Maintaining true friendship with China is the sincere desire of the people of all oppressed countries in Asia, especially the people of India. The Indian people will learn from every amazing achievement of the People's Republic of China. At present, the responsibility of the Indian people is first and foremost to strengthen the friendship between the Indian and Chinese peoples and to further expand this friendship.

    印度很多城市举行盛大集会
    庆祝我国建国两周年
    “自由报”著论热望中印友好
    【新华社讯】印度全国人民热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国建国两周年。很多城市举行了盛大的庆祝会。
    加尔各答人民九月三十日在印中友好协会的主持下，举行了庆祝中华人民共和国建国两周年的盛大集会。著名孟加拉文“划时代报”的主编穆开吉担任庆祝会的主席。
    中国总领事姚仲康在热烈的欢呼声中向庆祝会发表演说，他强调中印人民的友谊和合作对保障全亚洲的和平和自由的重要性。
    庆祝会主席穆开吉在大会上说：在过去两整年中，中国已经有了惊人的改变。中国不仅消灭了饥荒，并且及时地以粮食援助印度，救济数以百万计的饥民。
    他在结语中说：“我们向中国致敬，因为它为我们印度提供了光辉灿烂的榜样。”
    印度名记者哥斯、全印学生联合会总书记党、最近访问中国归来的莫克吉夫人和加尔各答华侨工商业家及其他著名人士都在会上发言，表示祝贺。
    孟买人民十月一日在印中友好协会主持下在卡马大厅举行庆祝会。许多发言者都提到中华人民共和国的光辉成就，并且热烈地赞扬中国人民的创造性的努力。
    共产党和其他左翼政党十月一日在孟买举行庆祝会。全印总工会副主席密拉杰卡担任大会主席。大会在热烈地欢呼印中劳动人民的友谊声中，通过决议：向中国人民祝贺他们对帝国主义反动派的力量进行斗争中获得的胜利。
    比哈尔省印中友好协会十月一日在巴特那举行庆祝会，在极为热烈的气氛中，通过了向新中国人民及其敬爱的毛泽东主席致贺的决议。
    孟买省阿麦达巴德和巴地阿拉（在巴地阿拉东旁遮普邦联盟）的市民也举行了同样的庆祝会。著名农民领袖雅尼克在阿麦达巴德的庆祝会上说：“我们应该毫不含糊地宣称，在历史上从来没有侵犯过印度的中国和苏联是我们的友人，我们将支持它们抵抗帝国主义摧毁它们的阴谋。”
    【新华社新德里六日电】印度加尔各答出版的孟加拉文“自由报”十月一日发表题为“万岁”的社论，热烈庆贺我国国庆。
    社论首先回溯二百年来亚洲饱受帝国主义凌辱的历史，说明十月一日不仅是中国人民的纪念日，而且也是整个亚洲，特别是印度人民的纪念日。
    社论说：世界各国人民对于中国的希望，已经在中国政府领袖的领导下实现了。农民所受到的封建剥削已经结束，并已得到土地。粮食不但能满足全国人民的需要，而且能在帝国主义奴役下的亚洲土地遭受饥荒，和美国要求以粮食换取卖身契的时候，毫无条件地把粮食运给它的邻居印度的饥饿人民，一天也没有耽搁。
    社论接着指出：亚洲的爱国者的眼睛都望着新中国。新中国也已经证明：中国人民永远是亚洲和平的哨兵。朝鲜与中国的团结，爱好自由的亚洲的团结，有力量肃清挑拨战争的帝国主义的暴力。中国人民志愿军在自由的理想的鼓舞下，正以无比的勇气，抵抗对全亚洲的自由的威胁。这便是中国为什么是亚洲的领袖的缘故。这便是中华人民共和国为什么得到被压迫的殖民地人民的真挚的和毫不犹豫的欢迎的缘故。
    社论在结语中说：和中国保持真正的友谊，是亚洲一切被压迫国家的人民、首先是印度人民的真挚愿望。印度人民将从中华人民共和国的每一个惊人成就中吸取教训。目前，印度人民的责任首先就是加强印中人民的友谊，并且进一步扩大这种友谊。
