Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th: The people of East China are paying their donations on schedule. According to incomplete statistics, the total amount for the region has reached 598.393 billion yuan, accounting for a little over 42.9% of the total pledged donations by the people of the region. Among them, Shanghai has already paid over 274.9 billion yuan, accounting for a little over 53% of the city's total pledged amount. Nanjing has paid over 18.3 billion yuan, Shandong has paid over 56.8 billion yuan, Zhejiang has paid over 113 billion yuan, Fujian has paid over 13.988 billion yuan, Southern Jiangsu has paid over 47.39 billion yuan, Northern Jiangsu has paid over 34.85 billion yuan, and Southern Anhui has paid over 9.122 billion yuan. Northern Anhui has paid over 30 billion yuan.

In terms of payment progress, six counties in Northern Jiangsu—Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Liuhe, Pixu, Xin'an, and Jianhu—and the Huaibei Salt Field have all exceeded their donation plans. The "Gaoyou," "Jianhu," "Jiangdu," and "Huaibei Salt Field" fighter planes have now been fully funded. Pixu originally planned to donate 900 million yuan to purchase a cannon, but now the payment has reached over 1.394 billion yuan, and the people of the county have decided to change the donation to a fighter plane. Workers at the Huafeng Paper Mill in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, in addition to exceeding and completing their scheduled donation of 1.6 billion yuan for the "Huafeng Workers" fighter plane ahead of schedule, have now decided to donate another "Huafeng Workers" fighter plane in the last three months of this year. Farmers in Jiading County, Southern Jiangsu, under the slogan of "Celebrating the Harvest, Defending the New China," paid 2 billion yuan, exceeding the donation by 500 million yuan. The business community in Nantong has paid 4.2 billion yuan, accounting for a little over 70% of the donation plan. They have decided to exceed the original planned donation of four fighter planes before the October Revolution Day and use this as a challenge to the business community in Wuxi.
