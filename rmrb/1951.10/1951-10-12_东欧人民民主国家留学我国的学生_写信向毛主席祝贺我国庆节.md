To Dear Comrade Mao Zedong:

We are students from the Eastern European People's Democratic countries – Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we extend our warmest greetings to you and the entire Chinese people you represent.

The great Chinese people, after a long struggle against foreign imperialism, domestic reactionaries, and feudalism, have achieved a great victory. This great victory is a new and powerful blow to world imperialism.

Because the great Soviet Union defeated the fascist bandits and achieved a victory of world historical significance; because the Red Army liberated our countries, enabling our working class to defeat capitalism; and because of the victory of the Chinese people, we are able to come to the People's Republic of China to study.

In our less than a year of life in China, we have seen the great achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, led by you and with the working class as the head, and their soaring enthusiasm in national construction.

The peace-loving Chinese people, after achieving their own victory, have demonstrated their spirit of internationalism – cherishing the freedom of others as much as they cherish their own. The Chinese people have sent their finest sons and daughters to Korea to fight alongside the Korean People's Army to defend world peace and against world imperialists.

On October 1st – the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we, the Eastern European People's Democratic countries’ students studying in China, assure you: In order to further consolidate the friendship between our peoples and strengthen the power of the world peace and democracy camp, we will work harder to learn the Chinese language, culture, and the history of the Chinese people's revolution.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the friendship of the people of all countries and world peace! (Attached photo)

    东欧人民民主国家留学我国的学生
    写信向毛主席祝贺我国庆节亲爱的毛泽东同志：
    我们是来自东欧人民民主国家——罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的学生。在中华人民共和国两周年国庆纪念的时候，我们向您和您所代表的全中国人民致以最热烈的敬礼。
    伟大的中国人民经过了跟国外帝国主义、国内反动派、封建主义长期的斗争后，已经取得了伟大的胜利，这个伟大的胜利对世界帝国主义是一个新的有力的打击。
    由于伟大的苏联战胜了法西斯匪徒，取得了具有世界历史意义的胜利；由于红军解放了我们的国家，使我们的工人阶级战胜了资本主义；由于中国人民的胜利，我们才能够到中华人民共和国来学习。
    在中国不到一年的生活中，我们看见了中国共产党和您领导的以工人阶级为首的中国人民所获得的伟大成就和他们在祖国建设中高涨的热情。
    热爱和平的中国人民在取得自己的胜利以后，表现出他们的国际主义精神——珍贵别人的自由也正如珍贵自己的自由一样。中国人民把自己最优秀的儿女送到朝鲜去，和朝鲜人民军一起为保卫世界和平和世界帝国主义者作斗争。
    在十月一日——中华人民共和国两周年国庆纪念的时候，我们东欧人民民主国家来华学习的学生向您保证：为了进一步巩固我们人民间的友谊，壮大世界和平民主阵营的力量，我们要更努力地学习中国语文、文化和中国人民革命的历史。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的、光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    各国人民的友谊和世界和平万岁！（附图片）
