    On the Construction of People's Representative Conferences at All Levels Nationwide
    Xie Juezai
            (I)
    In the past two years, People's Representative Conferences at all levels nationwide have achieved great results. The Northeast Administrative Region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have convened People's Representative Conferences of all sectors. Of the 28 provinces, 8 administrative regions equivalent to provinces, and 154 cities nationwide, all have convened People's Representative Conferences except for Fujian Province, which is actively preparing to convene, and 8 newly established cities that have not yet convened. Of the 2,068 counties and 117 administrative units equivalent to counties (such as banners, settlement bureaus, management bureaus, towns, special districts, directly subordinate districts, factory districts, autonomous districts, central districts, offices, etc.) nationwide, only 1,707 counties and 36 banners convened People's Representative Conferences last year, but this year the number has increased to 2,038 counties and 105 administrative units equivalent to counties. Only 30 counties and 12 administrative units equivalent to counties have not yet convened due to special circumstances. Townships (administrative villages) have generally convened People's Representative Conferences or Peasant Representative Conferences, and 30 cities with populations over 100,000 have convened district People's Representative Conferences.
    More importantly, the work of People's Representative Conferences in various localities has seen many creations and developments. The main situations and experiences are as follows:
    1.  People's Representative Conferences at all levels take the resolution of current major political tasks as their central content. In the past year, People's Representative Conferences in many places have enthusiastically discussed the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. We see that once the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is discussed by the People's Representative Conference, it immediately becomes a patriotic action of the broad masses, enhancing the patriotic and internationalist understanding of people from all walks of life. Discussing the issue of land reform through the People's Representative Conference makes land reform a matter of concern for people from all walks of life. Intellectuals and industrialists and businessmen going to the countryside to participate in land reform work, the establishment of urban-rural liaison committees, etc., are all support given to the peasants, thus forming a united front against feudalism. The People's Representative Conference's discussion of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries raised the people's vigilance. Cases of people and people's representatives personally capturing counter-revolutionary elements emerged one after another. The discussion of the handling of counter-revolutionary cases by the People's Representative Conference not only ensures accurate sentencing but also makes the people understand the greatness of the policy of combining suppression with leniency. While convening People's Representative Conferences to discuss the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, various localities also organized mass meetings and actions. In one city, the number of people listening to the broadcast of the People's Representative Conference often reached hundreds of thousands. Allowing all the people to jointly carry out the work of dictatorship over the enemy is precisely a characteristic that distinguishes the people's democratic dictatorship from the bourgeois dictatorship. The bourgeois dictatorship can only rely on the rule of its army, police, and secret agents, while the people's democratic dictatorship relies on the broad masses of the people. Therefore, it makes the people truly feel that the regime is in their hands, and the blow to the enemy is particularly heavy.
    2.  The number of directly and indirectly elected people's representatives is increasing day by day. In old areas such as North China and Northeast China, the directly and indirectly elected representatives have increased to 80% or 90%, while specially invited and recommended representatives have been reduced to 10% or 20%. Some places have abolished the method of organizational guarantees, allowing the people to choose their ideal figures themselves. Some places use the method of consultation to produce candidates and compare each other extremely carefully. This kind of election activity often becomes a mass movement to examine their political representatives. The people attach great importance to their rights. There are even cases of husbands and wives casting their own votes. Their conditions are also extremely strict. If they do not think it is their real representative, it is difficult to be elected. A representative of a certain county sheltered his own village, and the masses said: "Wait less than three months." Sure enough, he was defeated three months later. People's representatives have become an extremely glorious title. There are even those who feel disgraced and cry because they cannot be elected. Those who are elected also increase their sense of responsibility. Some do not absent themselves even when major accidents occur at home. Some travel to various townships to collect people's proposals and opinions. Some study on their own for fear of being incompetent. As for those who respond to the call, actively work, and play an exemplary role, it is even more common. According to incomplete statistics, the number of people's representatives at the provincial, county, and city levels totals more than 560,000, and the number at the district and township levels far exceeds this number. Their activities organize all the people and unite them around the people's government, becoming an unparalleled force.
    3.  People's Representative Conferences are not conducted in isolation. Some places publicize the government's work report and the central topics of the meeting before the meeting, organize people and representatives to discuss them, so that everyone can get a clear understanding and collect many extremely valuable opinions before the meeting. Some collect proposals at the same time as the election, and some put forward the slogan of "do a good job in the current work to welcome the People's Representative Conference" and carry out various propaganda activities. In this way, before the People's Representative Conference is convened, the people's democratic movement is very enthusiastic. The people are very concerned about the People's Representative Conference to be convened, and often inquire about the results of the meeting before it is over, and once a resolution is made, it can be turned into mass action. According to the experience of various localities, the election of representatives should be held in the winter slack season, and the government's work report and central topics should be publicized before the meeting, and proposals should be collected before the meeting. This is a must for every People's Representative Conference.
    4.  The movement of criticism and self-criticism is also becoming more familiar. In the past, some representatives had the idea of being a guest, and only said good things. In one People's Representative Conference in a certain county, everyone did not offer opinions to the people's government and cadres. An elderly farmer representative stood up and said: "We must be responsible to the people. Everyone knows that the people's government is good now. The important thing is to find out the problems so that we can make progress. If everyone doesn't speak, it will be difficult for the government and cadres to see clearly." This launched criticism and self-criticism. Experience has shown that the higher the people's and representatives' awareness of being masters of their own affairs, the more serious and conscientious the inspection of the government's work and the style of cadres can be; and the government's humble review and conscientious handling can improve the people's and representatives' awareness of being masters of their own affairs. If a cadre makes a mistake, he can be punished or dismissed by the superior, but if he is discussed by the People's Representative Conference and handled or dismissed by the people, the educational significance is particularly great. Now, there is such a phenomenon: the criticized government cadres have to review themselves at the People's Representative Conference. If the review is not thorough, the people's representatives will ask him to review again until everyone is satisfied. In addition, criticism between representatives and the government's criticism of individual representatives, as long as it is in good faith, can improve understanding and increase unity. Using criticism and commendation at the same time can make the People's Representative Conference a large classroom for people's representatives and cadres, and can get the people's enthusiastic support.
    5.  The election of members of the People's Government Committee by the People's Representative Conference not only expands the democratic foundation of the government but also makes the people feel particularly close to such a government. They said: "The county magistrate sent by the superior also did a lot of things for us, but it is not as good as being elected by ourselves." They are willing to elect those who are closely related to them, have done a lot of work, and have been tested to the government. Some are even people who have not been noticed or willing to work in another position by the superior, such as a county wanting to elect the deputy secretary of the county party committee as the deputy county magistrate, and a county wanting to elect a member of the women's federation (who has worked in the county for a long time) instead of the chairman of the women's federation (who was sent by the superior) as a member of the government committee. In this way, when deliberating the list of candidates, it is necessary to strictly implement the principle of democracy, obey the will of the people, and take care that people from all walks of life have their representatives in the government committee, so that the most ideal government committee for the people can be produced. The method of only deliberating and negotiating the list in advance by a few people, and only trying to persuade when there are differences of opinion, has proven to be very bad.
    6.  The People's Government in some places can often care about the lives of the people and promptly handle the demands and opinions put forward by the people. Before the People's Representative Conference, some sent responsible cadres to go deep into the masses to listen to their reflections. For the proposals that the people want to submit to the People's Representative Conference, they can quickly handle them before the meeting if they can be handled in time. This spirit of caring and being responsible to the people arouses the people's enthusiasm to reflect their opinions, and they enthusiastically submit what they want to say and want to do to the People's Representative Conference, so that the People's Representative Conference can solve more problems of the people. Some provinces have implemented the method of leaders of People's Governments and consultative committees and standing committees at all levels meeting with the people and handling people's letters. Some places issued representatives' letter paper and envelopes to facilitate representatives to write letters, and formulated strict registration, handling, reply, and inspection systems for letters from representatives and people. All of these have strengthened the connection between the government and the people.
    7.  The work of the consultative committee and the standing committee also has many creations. Some places have established a system in which members contact representatives separately, and representatives contact people regularly according to their profession or region, and regularly convene small group meetings of representatives, in which members participate separately, so that the upper and lower levels can communicate frequently. Various methods are also adopted to improve the enthusiasm and working ability of representatives. For other work of the consultative committee and the standing committee, such as organizing the study of various democratic parties, democratic personages, and people's representatives, organizing them to participate in the actual work of the three major movements, organizing them to assist the government in its work, and helping religious groups carry out the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement, those who can earnestly carry out these activities have achieved results and demonstrated the great role of the consultative committee and the standing committee, giving a powerful persuasion to those who think that "this kind of organization is unnecessary" and "has nothing to do."
    8.  National regional autonomy is the greatest demand of the people of all ethnic minorities. In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated or mixed communities, many places are gradually developing this work. According to incomplete statistics, in addition to townships and counties convening people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups in accordance with the general rules, 15 special districts, 4 leagues, and 3 autonomous regions equivalent to special districts have convened people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups. All those who convened the conference elected the People's Government Committee. Representatives of all ethnic minorities participated, and they were extremely excited to have the right to manage their own affairs, and hailed Chairman Mao as the "red sun of the East."

            (II)
    The above creations and developments not only show the significant progress of the people's democratic construction but also lay a good foundation for further developing the work in the future. However, the achievements are only preliminary, and the development of work in various places is still uneven. There are still many problems that need to be solved urgently. The most important ones are:
    1.  People's Representative Conferences at all levels have not yet universally become a regular system. In the first half of this year, more than 300 counties did not convene meetings. Some places still use the excuse of being busy with work and do not convene meetings on time. Some places only regard People's Representative Conferences as a way to promote work, and only convene them when needed, and do not convene them when not needed. Even in places where meetings have been convened, many do not regard it as a basic national system. Some combine People's Representative Conferences and cadre meetings, confusing People's Representative Conferences with cadre meetings, thus blurring the nature of People's Representative Conferences and reducing their role.
    2.  Provincial and municipal People's Representative Conferences exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress more often. Seventeen provinces have elected the chairman, vice-chairman, and members of the provincial People's Government. The number of municipal People's Representative Conferences exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress has increased to 69 cities, and 2 cities have convened the People's Congress. However, the number of county People's Representative Conferences exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress is still small. As of the end of September this year, there were only 186 counties, and another 27 counties convened the People's Congress. The county is an important link in the people's democratic construction, but many have not yet received the attention they deserve.
    3.  It is completely necessary for the People's Representative Conference to discuss and arrange the various major tasks of the People's Government. However, some places only pay attention to this aspect and do not pay attention to handling proposals from the people, forming a meeting that simply arranges tasks. The people's proposals are not discussed, or they are simply handled by the method of "answering." As a result, the representatives feel that "speaking does not work" and are unwilling to come to the meeting again.
    4.  The system of People's Government Committee meetings and the system of administrative meetings are more sound in provinces and large cities, but many are not sound, and some have not yet been established. Therefore, there is a lack of collective leadership within the People's Government, and it cannot fully promote democracy, concentrate will, and promote work. This naturally affects the implementation of the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference and the specific implementation of the policies and decrees of the superior People's Government.
    5.  The system of provincial and municipal consultative committees is relatively sound, and many have established regular work and achieved results. However, most still lack strong working institutions, and their work lacks planning and regularity. The standing committees of most counties are in name only, their organizational institutions are not widespread, they do not have a regular meeting system, and they do not have resident members and full-time cadres. Even a few counties have not yet established the organization of the standing committee. The basic reason for this phenomenon is the insufficient understanding of the people's democratic united front and the neglect of the role of this organization.

            (III)
    The reason why the above problems are widespread and serious is basically due to insufficient understanding. To solve these problems, the following important steps should be taken:
    1.  It is necessary to arouse the attention of the leaders of the high-level People's Government. The reason why there are many shortcomings in the construction of the regime is primarily because the superior People's Government did not promptly guide and help the lower levels. Some lower-level governments reflected: "It is not enough for the lower level to pay attention to it, the higher level must also pay attention to it." This is reasonable. The People's Governments of major administrative regions and provinces should convene meetings of responsible persons of governments above the county level at appropriate times. The experience of holding county magistrate meetings in North China has proven that this is the most effective step to promote the people's democratic construction of the regime.
    2.  It is necessary to regularly organize cadres to study the theory and policies of the people's democratic construction of the regime, especially to study Chairman Mao's On the People's Democratic Dictatorship, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the organizational rules of People's Representative Conferences at all levels and of all sectors, the organizational rules of People's Governments at all levels, and the relevant laws, decrees, and instructions of the Central People's Government. In the study, it is necessary to combine the examination of thoughts and work so that understanding and action can truly be consistent.
    3.  Establish a strict system of supervision, inspection, and reporting at each level, and strengthen specific guidance. At present, the People's Governments of major administrative regions and provinces should focus on guiding the democratic construction of the regime at the county level. All counties that meet the conditions should quickly exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elect the County People's Government Committee. In addition to cooperating with the Standing Committee to hold a good County People's Representative Conference and improve the democratic system of the County People's Government, the County People's Government should regularly and specifically guide the construction of district and township governments.

    全国各级各界人民代表会议的建设情况
    谢觉哉
            （一）
    两年来全国各级各界人民代表会议有很大的成绩。东北大行政区、内蒙古自治区已召开各界人民代表会议。全国二十八省、八个相当于省的行署区、一百五十四个市，除福建省正在积极筹备召开、有八个新设市尚未召开外，其余均已召开了人民代表会议。全国二千零六十八县、一百一十七个相当于县的行政单位（如旗、设治局、管理局、镇、特区、直属区、工厂区、自治区、中心区、办事处等），去年召开人民代表会议的只有一七○七县、三十六旗，今年则增至二○三八县和一百零五个相当于县的行政单位，只有三十个县和十二个相当于县的行政单位，因情况特殊，尚未召开。乡（行政村）一般均已召开了人民代表会议或农民代表会议，十万人口以上的城市，已有三十个市召开了区人民代表会议。
    更重要的是各地人民代表会议的工作有许多的创造与发展，其主要情况和经验如下：
    一、各级各界人民代表会议，均以解决当前的重大政治任务为中心内容。一年来许多地方的人民代表会议，热烈地讨论了开展抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，我们看：抗美援朝运动一经人民代表会议讨论，就立即成为广大群众的爱国主义的行动，提高了各界人民的爱国主义和国际主义的认识。通过人民代表会议讨论土地改革的问题，就使土地改革成为各界人民所关心事，知识分子和工商界下乡参加土地改革工作，城市成立了城乡联络委员会等，都是各方给农民的支援，因而组成了反封建的统一战线。人民代表会议讨论镇压反革命工作，提高了人民的警惕性，由人民和人民代表亲自捉住反革命分子的事，层出不穷。由人民代表会议讨论反革命案件的处理，不但使量刑准确，而且使人民了解了镇压与宽大相结合的政策的伟大。各地在召开人民代表会议讨论镇压反革命的同时，又组织了广大群众的会议与行动，一市之内收听人民代表会议广播的，往往数达几十万人。对敌人专政的工作，让全体人民来共同进行，这正是人民民主专政所以区别于资产阶级专政的一个特点。资产阶级专政只能依靠其军队、警察与特务的统治，而人民民主专政则依靠广大人民，因此，使人民确实感到政权是掌握在自己的手中，而对敌人的打击，就特别沉重。
    二、直接和间接选举的人民代表日益增多。在华北、东北等老区的市、县，直接间接选举的代表已增至百分之八、九十，特邀和推派的代表已减至百分之一、二十，有的地方取消了组织保证的办法，任凭人民自己挑选其理想的人物。有的地方用协商的办法产生候选人，相互比较，极为仔佃。这种选举的活动往往成为群众性的对其政治代表人物的检定运动。人民对自己的权利是极重视的，甚至有夫妻各投各的票的事；他们的条件也是极严格的，如果不是他认为是自己的真正的代表人物，很难当选。某县一代表有包庇本村的事，群众说：“等不到三个月”。三月以后，果然落选了。人民代表已成为极光荣的称号，甚至有不能当选感觉面无光彩而痛哭流涕者。凡当选者亦因而提高其责任心，有的虽家中发生重大事故，亦不缺席；有的奔走各乡，搜集人民的提案与意见，有的自动学习唯恐不能胜任，至于响应号召，积极工作，起模范作用者，则更为普遍。人民代表的数量，根据不完全的统计，省、县、市三级共计约五十六万余名，区乡则远超过此数。他们的活动就将全体人民组织起来，团结在人民政府的周围，成为无比的力量。
    三、人民代表会议并不是孤立进行的。有的地方，把政府的工作报告和会议的中心议题，在会前公布，组织人民和代表讨论，使大家摸底，能于会前搜集到许多极可宝贵的意见，有的在选举的同时，即搜集提案，有的则提出“做好当前工作，以迎接人民代表会议”的口号，并进行各种宣传活动。这样，人民代表会议还没有开，人民群众的民主运动已十分热烈。人民对所要召开的人民代表会议因而十分关心，往往在会议尚未结束之时，即打听会议的结果，而决议一经作出，即可转为群众的行动。根据各地的经验，代表的选举应该放在冬季农闲时举行，而政府工作报告及中心议题于会前公布，提案在会前搜集，则是每次人民代表会议都必须如此的。
    四、批评与自我批评的运动也进一步熟悉起来。以前有些代表有作客思想，专挑好听的话说，某县有一次人民代表会议，大家不给人民政府和干部提意见，有一老年农民代表站起来说：“我们得向人民负责任，于今人民政府好，谁不知道，要紧的是把毛病找出来，好进步，大家如果不说，政府与干部也难得看的都清楚。”以此展开了批评和自我批评。经验证明，人民与代表的主人翁觉悟越高，对政府工作和干部作风的检查就可以严肃认真；而政府的虚心检讨和认真处理，又能提高人民与代表的主人翁觉悟。一个干部犯了错误，本可由上级予以处分或撤职，但经过人民代表会议讨论，由人民来处理或撤职，其教育意义就特别的大。现在，已经发生了这样的现象：被批评的政府干部要在人民代表会议上检讨，如果检讨的不深刻，人民代表还要他重新检讨，直到大家满意为止。此外，代表与代表之间的批评，政府对于个别代表的批评，只要是出于善意，就能提高认识，增加团结，而将批评与表扬同时运用，就使人民代表会议成为人民代表和干部的大课堂，就能得到人民热烈的拥护。
    五、人民政府委员会委员，由人民代表会议选举，不但扩大了政府的民主基础，而且使人民对这样的政府感到特别的亲切。他们说：“上级派来的县长也给我们办了许多事，但总没有由我们自己选举的好。”他们乐意选那些和自己密切联系、作过许多工作、经过考验的人到政府中去，有些甚至是上级所未曾注意或愿意他在另一岗位工作的人，如某县要选中共县委副书记当副县长，某县要选妇联会的一个委员（她长期在该县工作）而不选妇联会主席（她是上级派去的）当政府委员。这样，在酝酿候选人名单时，必须严格执行民主的原则，服从人民的意志，并照顾到各方面人民均有其代表人物到政府委员会去，才可以产生最合人民理想的政府委员会。那种只由少数人事先酝酿协商名单，而在发生意见分歧时又只顾说服的办法，证明是很不好的。
    六、有些地方的人民政府能经常地关心人民群众的生活，及时处理人民提出的要求与意见。有的在人民代表会议以前，即派负责干部深入群众听取反映，对于人民要提出人民代表会议的提案，能够及时处理的，即在会前迅速处理。这种对人民关心和负责的精神，引起人民反映意见的积极性，把自己所要说的话和想办的事，踊跃提交人民代表会议，使人民代表会议能够更多地解决人民群众的问题。有的省贯彻了各级人民政府和协商委员会、常务委员会接见人民和处理人民来信的办法，有的地方发给代表信纸信封，给予代表写信的便利，对代表和人民的来信定出严格登记、处理、答复和检查的制度。凡此等等均加强了政府与人民的联系。
    七、协商委员会和常务委员会的工作亦有不少创造。有的地方建立了委员分别联系代表、代表按职业或地区固定联系人民的制度，定期召开代表的小组会议，由委员分别参加，以使上下经常通气。并采用各种办法，提高代表的积极性与工作能力。对于协商委员会和常务委员会的其他工作：如组织各民主党派、民主人士和人民代表的学习，组织他们参加三大运动的实际工作，组织他们协助政府工作，以及帮助宗教团体展开三自革新运动等，凡能认真进行的地方，就都得到成绩，并显出了协商委员会和常务委员会的很大作用，给那些认为“这种组织不必要”，“没有事干”的思想，以有力的说服。
      八、民族区域自治是各少数民族人民最大的一项要求，在少数民族聚居或杂居的地区，已有不少地方正在逐渐地开展这一工作。据不完全的统计，除了乡、县均依通则召开了各族各界人民代表会议外，并有十五个专署区，四个盟，三个相当于专署区的自治区召开了各族各界人民代表会议，凡召开了会议的，大都选举了人民政府委员会。各少数民族都有其代表人物参加，他们对于自己有权管理自己的事，感到异常兴奋，欢呼毛主席为“东方的红太阳”。
            （二）
    上述创造和发展，不仅说明人民民主建政工作显著的进步，而且为今后进一步开展工作打下了良好的基础。但成绩只是初步的，各地工作的发展尚不平衡，尚存在着不少问题亟须解决，最主要的是：
    一、各级人民代表会议尚未普遍地成为经常制度。本年上半年有三百余县未召开会议，有些地方仍借口工作忙不按期召开，又有些地方把人民代表会议只看成推动工作的一种方式，需要时才开，不需要就不开。就是在开了会的地方，许多也并未当作国家的基本制度，有的把人民代表会议和干部会议合并召开，使人民代表会议与干部会议相混淆，因而模糊了人民代表会议的性质，降低了它的作用。
    二、省、市人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的较多，有十七省已选举了省人民政府主席、副主席及委员。市人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的已增至六十九市，有二市已召开了人民代表大会。而县人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的却还是少数。截至本年九月底止，还只有一百八十六县，另有二十七县召开了人民代表大会。县是人民民主建政的重要环节，可是很多还未引起应有的重视。
    三、人民代表会议讨论布置人民政府的各项重大工作是完全必要的。但有的地方只注意到这一方面，不重视处理来自人民的提案，形成单纯布置任务的会议。对人民的提案不予讨论，或单纯用“解答”的方法来处理。因之，代表感到“说话不顶事”，就不愿再来开会。
    四、人民政府委员会议的制度及行政会议的制度，除省及大城市较为健全外，很多还不健全，有的迄今还没有建立。因而在人民政府内部缺乏集体领导，不能充分发扬民主，集中意志，推动工作。这也就自然而然地影响到人民代表会议决议的贯彻和上级人民政府政策法令的具体实施。
    五、省、市协商委员会的制度较健全，好多已建立起经常工作，并得到了成绩。但多数还缺乏有力的工作机构，工作缺乏计划性和经常性。县常务委员会大部分是有名无实，组织机构不广泛，没有定期的会议制度，未设驻会委员和专职干部。甚至有少数县迄今尚未建立常务委员会的组织。造成这种现象的基本原因，是由于对人民民主统一战线认识不足，忽视这种组织的作用。
            （三）
    上述问题之所以普遍而严重地存在，基本上是由于认识不足所造成的。解决这些问题，应采取以下重要步骤：
    一、必须引起高级人民政府领导的重视，建政工作所以存在许多的缺点，首先是因为上级人民政府没有及时指导和帮助下级所造成的。有的下级政府反映：“只下级重视不行，还得上级重视”；这话是有道理的。各大行政区、各省人民政府应在适当时期内，召集县以上的政府负责人的会议，华北召开县长会议的经验已经证明，这是推动人民民主建政工作的最有效的步骤。
    二、必须经常地组织干部进行人民民主建政的理论与政策的学习，特别是学习毛主席的论人民民主专政、刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话，人民政协共同纲领，各级各界人民代表会议组织通则，各级人民政府组织通则，以及中央人民政府的有关法令和指示。在学习中必须结合检查思想和工作，这样，才能使认识和行动真正一致起来。
    三、逐级建立严格的督促检查和报告制度，并加强具体指导。目前，大行政区和省人民政府应以县为民主建政工作的指导重点，各县凡条件具备了的，即应迅速代行人民代表大会的职权，选举县人民政府委员会。县人民政府除协同常务委员会开好县人民代表会议和健全县人民政府的民主制度外，应经常具体指导区乡政权的建设。
