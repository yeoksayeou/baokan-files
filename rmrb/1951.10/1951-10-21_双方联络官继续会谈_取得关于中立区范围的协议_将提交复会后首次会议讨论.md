Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 20th - The liaison officers of both sides continued talks on October 20th to negotiate matters concerning the resumption of the armistice talks between the delegations of both sides. The meeting began at 10:00 AM and adjourned at 11:55 AM. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM and ended at 5:10 PM. The meeting on October 21st is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM. In order to once again eliminate all pretexts for the other side to delay the prompt resumption of the armistice talks, our liaison officer agreed at the meeting on the 20th to the other side's proposal to designate the area 200 meters on each side of the Kaesong, Panmunjom, and Munsan corridors as neutral zones. According to the existing agreement between the liaison officers of both sides, the liaison officers of both sides will submit the following draft agreement on the scope of the neutral zone for consideration by the delegations of both sides at the first meeting after the resumption:

	(1) Meeting Area - A circular area with a radius of 1,000 yards, centered on the meeting place near Panmunjom.
	(2) Kaesong Area - A circular area with a radius of three miles, centered on the Kaesong traffic center.
	(3) Munsan Area - The United Nations Command delegation's residence within a circular area with a radius of three miles.
	(4) Corridor - The corridor between Kaesong, Panmunjom, and Munsan, and the area 200 meters on each side.

In the meeting, our liaison officer continued to refute the unreasonable demand still insisted upon by the other side that military aircraft be allowed to fly over the Kaesong, Munsan, and corridor areas. Our liaison officer pointed out: Under such unreasonable demands, serious incidents similar to the previous attacks on the neutral zone will be unavoidable, and the armistice talks will not be able to proceed smoothly.

    双方联络官继续会谈
    取得关于中立区范围的协议
    将提交复会后首次会议讨论
        我方继续驳斥对方无理要求
    【新华社开城二十日电】十月二十日双方联络官继续会谈协商双方代表团复会事宜，会议在上午十时开始，十一时五十五分休会。下午三时继续开会，五时十分结束。十月二十一日的会议定于上午十时举行。我方联络官在二十日的会上为再度解除对方一切拖延停战谈判会议迅速复会的藉口，同意了对方所提出的以开城、板门店、汶山通道两侧各二百公尺的地区划为中立地区的建议。根据双方联络官之间已有的协议，双方联络官将提交双方代表团在复会后第一次会议上考虑的关于中立区范围的协议草案如下：
    （一）会场区——以板门店附近会场为中心，一千码为半径的圆形区域。
    （二）开城区——以开城交通中心为圆心，三英里为半径的圆形区域。
    （三）汶山区——以三英里为半径的圆形区域内的联合国军代表团驻地。
    （四）通道——开城、板门店、汶山间的通道及两侧各二百公尺的地区。
    我方联络官在会议中继续驳斥对方所仍然坚持的军用飞机可以飞入开城、汶山区及通道区域上空的无理要求。我方联络官指出：在这种无理要求之下，类似以往的攻击中立区的严重事件将无法避免，停战谈判会议将无从顺利进行。
