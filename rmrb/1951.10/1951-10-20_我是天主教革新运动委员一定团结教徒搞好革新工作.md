Reader's Letter

    To the Editor:
    I am from Baodi County, Hebei Province, and a Catholic of six generations. Before liberation, I was so poor that I could not afford to eat. At the age of fourteen, I came to Beijing as an apprentice. At that time, I was always doing chores for the boss, and being beaten and scolded was commonplace. What saddened me the most was that a hospital run by the Catholic Church before liberation killed my wife. She had a minor illness, but the hospital did not treat her properly and would not let us visit her. After two months, she died.
    After liberation, my life changed. My family was allocated 56 mu of land, and we had enough to eat and wear. I work as a barber and earn several hundred catties of rice every month. All my children are in school. After liberation, I joined the amateur school in the Third District. I have made progress.
    Since the beginning of the Catholic Reform Movement, I have actively participated. I have accused all the imperialist elements’ crimes that I knew, and studied with other Catholics. We have held many study sessions and accusation meetings here, and we signed to expel the imperialist element, Li Peili. We established the Reform Promotion Committee, and the Catholics elected me as the deputy director. Moreover, I was also elected as a member of the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee.
    Editor: The absolute majority of us Catholics love our great motherland. In the past, Catholicism was used by imperialism to invade China. Today, we will not allow Catholicism to be manipulated by imperialism. We must unite, eliminate those imperialist elements, and do a good job in the Catholic self-reliance reform movement.
          Verbally dictated by Wang Huaibao, member of the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee and Deputy Director of the Reform Promotion Committee of the Xiaojingchang Church in the Third District.

### 我是天主教革新运动委员一定团结教徒搞好革新工作

    我是天主教革新运动委员一定团结教徒搞好革新工作编辑同志：
    我是河北宝坻县人，是六辈的天主教老教友。解放前我穷得吃不上饭，十四岁就来到北京当学徒。那时，整天给掌柜的打杂，挨打、挨骂是常事。最使我伤心的事，是在解放前天主教办的一个医院，活活把我的妻子治死。本来她是小病，医院不好好给医治，还不让我们到医院去看，这样经过两个月，她就死了。
    解放后，我的生活不同了，家里分了五十六亩地，家里有吃有穿，我做理发工作，每月也能挣好几百斤米，我的孩子也全上了学。我在解放后，入了三区业余学校。我进步了。
    天主教革新运动开始以后，我积极地参加了，我控诉了我所知道的一切帝国主义分子的罪行，并和其他的教友们一起学习。我们这里已开过了不少的学习会和控诉会，我们并签名驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里。我们成立了革新促进委员会，教友们推选我为副主任。而且我还当选了北京市天主教徒革新委员会的委员。
    编辑同志：我们绝对大多数的天主教徒，是爱我们伟大的祖国的，过去天主教给帝国主义利用来侵略中国，今天我们不容许天主教给帝国主义来操纵，我们一定团结起来，清除那些帝国主义分子。一定把天主教的自立革新运动搞好。
