Transforming Leadership Thinking is Key to Doing a Good Job in Basic Construction
Guan Yun, Director of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau

After the People's Daily published the editorial "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design" on June 16th, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a notice on inspecting basic construction on June 19th, we immediately organized cadres to study these documents and conducted focused inspections. To fundamentally solve this problem ideologically, correct our attitude towards basic construction, and strengthen future basic construction work, we felt it necessary to conduct a historical and comprehensive inspection of basic construction at the Fengfeng Mining Bureau.

I. Recovering from the War, Employees are Accustomed to Crash Tasks, But Not Good at Carrying Out Work Systematically and According to Plan

The Fengfeng Coal Mine was liberated in the autumn of 1945 after the Japanese invaders announced their unconditional surrender, making it one of the earliest liberated mines in North China. In 1946, the Fengfeng Coal Mine was directly threatened by the war and ordered to fully prepare for war, resulting in a complete halt to production. In 1947, the People's Liberation Army began its counter-offensive, and the Fengfeng Coal Mine gradually became a distant rear area, gradually eliminating the threat of war. To support the war and solve the fuel needs of the military and civilians, restoration work began. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the efforts of the vast number of employees, production was gradually restored under extremely difficult conditions of material shortages, inconvenient transportation, and a lack of technical personnel. By 1949, it was able to produce 800 to 1,000 tons of coal per day. This historical condition has had a great impact on all aspects of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's work.

Under these historical conditions, the ideology and work style of the workers and cadres of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau have the following advantages:

1. The Fengfeng Coal Mine restored production under difficult conditions, so the spirit of cadres and workers overcoming difficulties is generally good.

2. After liberation in 1945, following the ideological mobilization during the 1946 war preparations, the anti-foreman and democratic movements (i.e., mobilizing employees to provide opinions from production and construction to the work style of cadres) generally mobilized the masses relatively deeply, and the workers' awareness was also relatively high.

However, there are still some shortcomings in the ideology and work style of cadres and workers:

1. During the restoration period, the Fengfeng Coal Mine basically carried out work under the original equipment and technical conditions. At that time, the technical authority was the old coal master. The old coal masters relied solely on experience and did not engage in scientific calculation. This style of work, combined with the blind enthusiasm of leading cadres, formed a work style that was enthusiastic and daring, but neglected calculation and failed to be realistic and seek truth from facts.

2. The Fengfeng Coal Mine cadres and workers have a very good spirit of tackling key problems, but they are eager for quick results and are not accustomed to carrying out work systematically and according to plan.

II. When Transitioning from Recovery to Development, Leading Cadres Did Not Consciously Organize the Transformation

After the founding of the Central People's Government in October 1949, the state began to invest in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. The Fengfeng Mining Bureau began to rebuild and restore roadways, increase lifting capacity, and production capacity rapidly increased. To meet production needs, civil and wooden construction also increased significantly. To strengthen the work of our bureau, the Coal Mine Management Bureau sent several batches of technical personnel after 1950. Therefore, judging from the increase in output and personnel, especially the huge amount of investment in basic construction, the large number of projects, and the large scale, it shows that the Fengfeng Mining Bureau had entered a stage of development after 1950 from a stage of recovery. The development stage requires doing a good job in basic construction and improving production capacity in all aspects (opening up new mining areas and increasing the capacity of pit well transportation and lifting). Therefore, the Fengfeng Mining Bureau should have put forward the principle of giving equal importance to production and basic construction in early 1950, strengthened leadership over basic construction, enlightened cadres to recognize the arduousness of basic construction tasks, recognize the characteristics and tasks of the development stage, strictly prevent empiricism, critically apply the work experience of the recovery period, and enter the development period systematically and with preparation. However, the leading cadres did not have a deep or clear understanding of this change and did not consciously organize this transformation. In the development period after 1950, there was an erroneous idea of emphasizing production and neglecting construction among the leading cadres. At the same time, there were serious guerrilla habits and empiricist ideologies in basic construction.

III. Errors in Basic Construction are Mainly Manifested in Unrealistic Planning and Crude Design

1. Making plans without proceeding from reality is one of the fundamental reasons for errors in basic construction.

When making plans, we do not proceed from investigating and studying the actual situation, and we do not correctly estimate subjective strength. We desire much and desire big things. We often include newly heard of, visited, and even book-checkable machines in the plan as much as possible. For example, in 1950, only 55.2 percent of the projects were completed according to plan, and only 39.64 percent of the planned investment was used. For example, the Fengfeng Power Plant's reservoir project had already been planned and approved by the higher authorities, but the leading cadres believed that the Fuyang River water could solve the problem of circulating water, so they rashly cancelled the reservoir project and diverted the funds to other uses. Now, whenever the Fuyang River water rises, the power plant's circulating water has problems and there is a risk of power outages.

When making plans, there is also a tendency of departmentalism of occupying more investment and using less. We often ask for large numbers, but actually have no ability to complete the task or do not urgently need funds, resulting in the accumulation of funds and waste of materials. For example, in 1950, it was planned to add eight 64-horsepower coal cutting machines, but only two were used until the third quarter of 1951.

2. There are also two deviations in design work. One is the carelessness, dogmatism, and eagerness for quick success of technical cadres. Most of the technical personnel have participated in work for a relatively short period, and there is a careless style of work. Some people draw a few rough lines and then let the construction begin; some proceed from book knowledge, taking books as the only basis, instead of first understanding the actual situation and using books as a reference. This practice of doing things according to the book and building cars behind closed doors has caused many problems and had to be changed again and again. Some are designing for the sake of designing. Once the drawing is completed, it is considered that the job is done. Whether the plan can be realized is considered the matter of the management personnel or the construction personnel. This situation shows that some technical personnel do not have enough spirit of being responsible for the people's cause. The leading cadres are also eager for quick success, especially when approving projects, they do not seek thorough understanding, and they approve when they see that it is almost there, and they approve it so that construction can start quickly. The combination of these two styles of work makes it difficult to correct errors in design work. On the other hand, the leading cadres' eagerness for quick success and the old technicians' empiricism are also a root cause of deviations in design work.

Due to the above reasons, many problems have occurred in the basic construction of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. For example, unplanned projects started without state approval accounted for 24.37 percent of the total number of projects and 3.91 percent of the total investment. Projects that were approved but whose plans were changed accounted for 24.3 percent of the total number of projects and 10.42 percent of the total investment. In 1951, the Coal Mine Management Bureau pointed out the seriousness of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's uncompleted basic construction tasks and its chaotic situation. But this still did not attract our attention, so the basic construction work in 1951 did not improve much. It was only because of the reduction of investment and the reduction of projects that the number of projects with mid-term changes in plans and unplanned projects was not as high as last year. It was not until the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Central Fuel Industry Department, and the Coal Mine Management Bureau successively issued notices on inspecting basic construction, and the People's Daily issued editorials and continuously published articles discussing basic construction, that we paid attention and checked out the above problems.

IV. The Key to Improving Basic Construction Work Lies in Transforming Leadership Thinking, Mobilizing the Masses, and Improving the System

1. I believe that the errors in the basic construction work of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau are not accidental or isolated, but have historical ideological roots. Therefore, these problems cannot be solved by making one or two reports, or by criticizing them. Because many cadres, even leading cadres, are burdened with heavy burdens from the old liberated areas, believing that their work is hard, or that the Fengfeng Coal Mine was the earliest liberated mine in North China and has a foundation, thereby paralyzing themselves, their vigilance against shortcomings in work is not high, and they are prone to relax their self-examination and are not easy to accept criticism. The past mistakes in basic construction of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau are serious, and the tasks in the second half of this year are quite heavy, so this issue must be taken seriously. The way to solve the problem, I think, should first focus on leading cadres and seriously study the documents. In addition to the People's Daily editorials and other directly related documents, it is also necessary to study Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and the 1941 "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Investigation and Research." Without the transformation of the ideological work style of the leading cadres, it is simply impossible to do a good job in basic construction. This is the premise, this is the beginning. Secondly, we must strengthen the political study of technical personnel, help them establish the spirit of being responsible for the people's cause to the end, and oppose the bourgeois view of technology for technology's sake and design for design's sake.

2. On the basis of study, we should focus on inspecting past basic construction, from planning and design to construction and acceptance, as well as economic accounting and quota management, specifically recognize achievements and errors, summarize experiences and lessons, and find solutions to problems.

3. To do a good job in basic construction, the following five issues must also be resolved: (1) Strengthening the Party's leadership over basic construction is the decisive factor in ensuring the completion of the state's basic construction tasks. (2) Relying on the working class. The democratic reform of the basic construction department of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau is far behind that of the production department. Most of the construction tasks are undertaken by temporary workers, and welfare and housing are not available to them. The factory management committee and the workers' representative meeting have no representatives from them, and there are even remnants of foremen who are ruling workers, deducting workers' food, and raising their own wages privately. Construction begins with recruiting workers everywhere, and they are dismissed immediately after the project is completed. Trade union organizations have not been established for a long time. Workers have no support and are "called upon to come and waved away to go," their lives are not guaranteed, and they have no political rights, so it is difficult for them to have a sense of ownership. To do a good job in basic construction work, this issue must be resolved in a planned and step-by-step manner. (3) From design to construction, a special responsibility system must be established to overcome the chaotic phenomenon of everyone being responsible and interfering randomly (in essence, no one is responsible). (4) Improve the various systems of basic construction, and while improving the basic construction organization and adding engineering teams, a check system for engineering preparation should be established; those who are not fully prepared should never start easily, and once construction begins, it must be completed in one go and cannot be delayed. Secondly, it is also necessary to establish an inspection system during construction, a summary system after completion (including financial settlement), and a reward system. (5) Strictly implement the basic construction procedures and basic construction management system stipulated by the Central Financial and Economic Committee, oppose blind construction, adhere to working according to the system, and carry out construction according to the plan.

The above is only a preliminary review, because I have only been in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau for half a year, and I have not directly handled many projects, so I only made a review based on the information I have learned. I hope everyone will help us to further conduct an in-depth inspection.

    转变领导思想是作好基本建设的关键
    峰峰矿务局局长  管云
    六月十六日人民日报发表了“没有工程设计就不可能施工”的社论，六月十九日中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会发布了检查基本建设的通知后，我们即组织干部学习这些文件，并作重点检查。为从思想上彻底解决这一问题，端正我们对基本建设的态度，加强今后的基本建设工作，我们觉得对峰峰矿务局基本建设作一历史的全面的检查，是有必要的。
    一、从战争中恢复起来，职工习惯于突击任务，而不善于有步骤有计划地进行工作
    峰峰煤矿是一九四五年秋日寇宣布无条件投降后解放的，是华北解放较早的矿山之一。一九四六年峰峰煤矿直接受到战争威胁，奉令彻底备战，生产全部停顿。一九四七年人民解放军开始反攻，峰峰煤矿逐渐成为战争的远后方，逐渐消除了战争威胁；为支援战争，解决军民燃料，开始进行恢复工作。由于党与政府的正确领导和广大职工的努力，在器材极端困难、交通不便、缺乏技术人员的条件下，逐步地恢复了生产，到一九四九年已能日产八百到一千吨煤。这种历史条件，对峰峰矿务局的各种工作，是有很大影响的。
    在这种历史条件下，峰峰矿务局工人和干部的思想作风就有以下优点：
    1、峰峰煤矿是在困难条件下恢复生产的，因此干部与工人克服困难的精神一般是好的。
    2、一九四五年解放后，经过一九四六年备战时的思想动员，反把头与民主运动（即发动职工从生产建设到干部作风提意见），发动群众一般比较深入，职工觉悟也较高。
    但是，干部和工人的思想作风也还存在一些缺点：
    1、峰峰煤矿在恢复时期基本上是在原有的设备条件与技术条件下进行工作。当时技术上的权威是老煤师。老煤师单凭经验，不会科学的计算。这种作风与领导干部的盲目热情相结合，形成了热情敢干，但忽略计算，不能实事求是的工作作风。
    2、峰峰煤矿干部和工人的突击精神很好，但是急于求成，不习惯有步骤、有计划地进行工作。
    二、由恢复走向发展时，领导干部未有意识地组织转变
    一九四九年十月，中央人民政府成立之后，国家即开始对峰峰矿务局投资。峰峰矿务局开始改建和恢复巷道，增加提升能力，生产能力迅速提高。为适应生产需要，土、木建筑亦增加不少。煤矿管理总局为加强我局工作，一九五○年以后，即派来数批技术人员。因此不论从产量和人员的增加，特别是基本建设投资之巨、项目之多、规模之大看来，都说明峰峰矿务局在一九五○年后，已由恢复阶段进入发展阶段。发展阶段，要求作好基本建设工作，从各方面提高生产能力（开辟新采煤区和增加坑井运搬提升能力）。因此，峰峰矿务局在一九五○年初即应提出生产与基本建设并重的原则，加强对基本建设的领导，启发干部认识基本建设任务的繁重，认识发展阶段的特点与任务，严防经验主义，批判地运用恢复时期的工作经验，有步骤有准备地进入发展时期。但是，领导干部对这一变化认识得不深刻，不明确，没有有意识地组织这一转变。在一九五○年以后的发展时期，领导干部中存在着重生产轻建设的错误思想，同时，在基本建设中存在着严重的游击习气与经验主义的思想方法。
    三、基本建设中的错误，主要表现在计划不切实际和设计粗糙
    1、订计划不从实际出发，这是基本建设发生错误的基本原因之一。
    作计划时不从调查研究实际情况出发，不正确估计主观力量，愿意多，愿意大。常常把听说过的、参观过的，以至书本上可以查明的新机器都尽可能的列入计划之内。如一九五○年的工程按照计划完成的仅占百分之五五点二，使用投资仅占计划的百分之三九点六四。又如峰峰电厂蓄水池的工程已经作了计划，上级也已经批准，但领导干部又认为釜阳河水可以解决循环水的问题，于是轻率地取消了蓄水池工程，将资金挪作别用。至今每逢釜阳河水涨，电厂循环水即发生问题而有停电危险。
    作计划时，还存在着占取投资多领少用的本位主义思想，往往要求数字大，实际无力完成任务或并不急需资金，以致积压资金，浪费器材。如：一九五○年计划添置六四马力割煤机八台，至一九五一年第三季才使用二台。
    2、设计工作中也存在着两种偏向。一种是技术干部的粗枝大叶，教条主义与急于求成。大多数的技术人员参加工作时期较短，工作中存在着粗枝大叶作风。有人划几个粗线条即让施工；有的是从书本知识出发，以书本当作唯一根据，而不是首先了解实际情况，将书本作为参考。这种照书文办事，闭户造车的作法，发生不少问题，不得不再三改变。有的是为设计而设计，图样一成，就算交了差事，计划是否能实现，他认为是管理人员的事，或者是施工人员的事了。这种情形说明，有些技术人员，为人民事业负责到底的精神，是不够的。领导干部又是急于求成，特别是批核工程时不求甚解，看着差不多了就批准，批准了好快点动工，这两种作风结合起来，使得设计工作中的错误很难得到纠正。另一方面，领导干部的急于求成和老技工的经验主义，也是设计工作发生偏差的一个根源。
    由于上述原因，峰峰矿务局基本建设中发生的问题很多。比如，未经国家批准自行动工的无计划的工程，占总数的百分之二十四点三七，占投资总数的百分之三点九一。批准后而又变更计划的工程占总件数的百分之二十四点三，占总投资的百分之十点四二。一九五一年煤矿管理总局指出峰峰矿务局基本建设未完成任务，及其混乱情况的严重性。但仍未引起我们的注意，所以一九五一年基本建设工作起色仍不大。只是由于投资减少，工程减少，因而中途变更计划及无计划工程不像去年那样多了。直到这次政务院财政经济委员会、中央燃料工业部及煤矿管理总局连续发出检查基本建设的通知，人民日报发出社论又连续刊登讨论基本建设的文章时，才引起我们的注意，检查出以上的问题。四、改进基本建设工作的关键，在于转变领导思想，发动群众，健全制度
    1、我认为峰峰矿务局基本建设工作中的错误不是偶然的、个别的，而是有历史思想根源的。因之，这些问题就不是作上一次两次报告，或批评一下所能解决的。因为好多干部甚至领导干部都背上很沉重的老解放区的包袱，认为自己工作是努力的，或认为峰峰煤矿在华北各矿中是解放最早的，是有基础的，因而麻痹了自己，对工作缺点的警觉不高，并且容易放松对自己的检查，不容易接受批评。峰峰矿务局过去在基本建设中的错误是严重的，今年下半年任务又相当重大，因此，必须认真对待这一问题。解决问题的办法，我认为首先应以领导干部为重点，认真学习文件。除人民日报社论及其他直接有关的文件外，还需学习毛主席的“实践论”与一九四一年“中共中央关于调查研究的决定”。没有领导干部思想作风的转变，想作好基本建设工作，简直是不可能的。这是前提，这是开端。其次，必须加强技术人员的政治学习，帮助他们树立对人民事业负责到底的精神，反对资产阶级的为技术而技术、为设计而设计的观点。
    2、在学习的基础上，有重点地检查以往基本建设，从计划、设计到施工、验收，以及经济核算，定额管理各方面，具体地认识成绩及错误，总结经验教训，找出解决问题的办法。
    3、要作好基本建设，还必须解决以下五个问题：（一）加强党对基本建设的领导，这是保证国家基本建设任务完成的决定因素。（二）依靠工人阶级问题。峰峰矿务局基本建设部门的民主改革远远落后于生产部门。建设任务大部是临时工担任，福利、房屋没有他们的份儿。工厂管理委员会、职工代表会没有他们的代表，甚至还有把头残余在统治工人、克扣工人伙食、私抬自己工资的。建设开始到处招募工人，工程落成随即解散，工会组织长期没有建立。工人无依无靠，“招之即来，挥之即去”，生活无保证，又无政治权利，很难有主人翁感觉。要作好基本建设工作，必须有计划有步骤地解决这一问题。（三）从设计到施工，必须建立专责制，克服大家负责乱插手（实质上无人负责）的混乱现象。（四）健全基本建设的各种制度，与健全基本建设组织，增设工程队的同时，应建立工程准备之检查制；准备不完备者，决不轻意动手，既经施工，必须一气完成，不能拖延时间。其次，还须建立施工中的检查制度，完工后的总结制度（包括财务决算）与奖励制度。（五）严格实行中央财政经济委员会规定的基本建设程序，及基本建设管理制度，反对盲目施工，坚持按制度办事，按计划施工。
    以上仅是初步检讨，因为我到峰峰矿务局才半年，好多工程没有直接经手，仅从了解到的情况作一检讨。希望大家帮助我们进一步深入检查。
