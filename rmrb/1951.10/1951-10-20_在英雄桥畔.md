    At the Side of Hero Bridge
        Zhang Zhimin
    On the Korean front, we live near an iron bridge. Here, no matter day or night, rain or shine, you can hear the sound of enemy planes. If you ask how many methods the enemy has used to destroy this bridge—it’s endless; if you ask how many times the enemy has blown up this bridge—it’s impossible to remember. However, I know one thing: every day as dusk approaches, you can see long trains, one after another, rushing across this bridge, their majestic whistles shaking the fields and valleys. The heroic road builders who are defending the bridge, no matter how tired they are from work, will stand up, applaud, and excitedly watch the trains, loaded with grain and ammunition, rush to the front lines.
    How are our heroes creating miracles? Xu, the political commissar of a certain railway unit fighting here, told me: "It's not easy to be an outstanding hero here! Because everyone here has their own heroic deeds." Political Commissar Xu, like his troops, is both heroic and young. Every time he talks about the difficulties in his work, he turns his intelligent eyes and says, "There is a way!" He glances at the soldiers who are working and says to me: "These soldiers are gold, and each of them will radiate a brilliant light. Nothing is more precious to us than them!" He loves his soldiers so much! A few days ago, a soldier was killed by enemy planes while repairing the bridge, and he didn't sleep well all night.
    The bridge plays a very important role on the entire Korean battlefield. In terms of length it is only a hundred meters or so, but if even half a meter is broken, it cannot be used, which will affect our victory. Precisely because of this, the American bandits have devised all sorts of vicious methods to destroy it. The bridge is surrounded by bomb craters of all sizes, and the steel beams have countless scars. Big bombs, small bombs, cluster bombs, time bombs—the American bandits have used all these weapons.
    It was a night in early March, and the wind was swirling snowflakes that stung people's faces like knives. The snow on the ground was so frozen that people's feet were numb. On this very night, the enemy's planes dropped a one-thousand-pound time bomb, which landed right next to a bridge pier. This was a vicious fellow! If it exploded, the bridge would be damaged, and it would not be repaired in a day or two. If transportation were interrupted, it would have a great impact on our war effort.
    People were anxious. Soldiers volunteered to risk their lives to remove the time bomb. At this moment, a dark figure was already wriggling from the shore into the water. Who was it? It was Communist Party member Wang Guozhang, this twenty-two-year-old youth who was still a bit like a child, had already begun his heroic action.
    The water was one and a half meters deep, and thin ice floated on the surface. The bomb was not on the surface of the water, but submerged. To find out exactly where it was, he had to dive into the water. As soon as Wang Guozhang entered the water, his whole body turned purple, and he was shivering all over, so cold that he couldn't breathe; but his heart was fiery. This fiery heart burned him, encouraged him, and made him bravely try to complete this dangerous task. Comrades on the shore wanted to replace him, but he refused. He thought that if the time bomb exploded, he did not want to sacrifice another comrade. He calmly searched in the water for a long time and found it! He put the rope he was carrying on the ring of the bomb and shouted to his comrades: "Pull!" The rope stretched straight from the river to the shore, but when the comrades on the shore pulled hard, the rope came off. Wang Guozhang calmly put the rope back on, and the comrades continued to pull the bomb to the shore. At this time, the time bomb exploded, but our bridge was safe and sound. Looking at our train coming from afar, the heroes' excitement was indescribable.
    When the homeland's railway worker delegation visited Comrade Wang Guozhang in Korea, they asked him: "When you were pulling the time bomb, did you think that if it exploded, you would be sacrificed?" He replied: "At that time, I only thought: if it exploded, the bridge would be destroyed, we would not be able to transport supplies, and I don't know how much damage it would cause!"
    As autumn approached, the rainy season came to Korea.
    The rain poured down continuously for days, and the large and small mountain gullies were flooded. The high waves were tumbling. This was more urgent than battle! The sentries on duty at the bridgehead were constantly reporting the water level to their superiors by telephone. One and a half meters, one and seven tenths meters, two meters, two and a half meters... the bridge was about to be submerged... Hearing this situation, the political commissar said to himself: "This is an even more vicious enemy!"
    Indeed, the flood was a more vicious enemy! It howled like a beast, churning like the sea. The rice paddies on the shore were submerged; only the heads of the sorghum were swaying; the small pine trees on the shore flickered a few times and were uprooted; the bridge was about to be swallowed by the flood, and the trestles erected with sleepers were tilted, overturned, and washed away.
    Was there a more urgent task than this? Not a second could be wasted! Because those sleepers could be washed away several meters per second in the rapids. This was a very urgent task! Because the more the floods raged and the transportation lines were damaged, the more our front lines needed the guarantee of supplies. The bridge, in any case, could not be cut off!
    "Jump down and grab the sleepers! Grab the materials!" Under the leadership of political instructor Chen Yuming, Communist Party member Zhang Guotian jumped down, Zhang Wenzhi jumped down, Qin Guo, who had not yet recovered from his injuries, also jumped down... Heroes jumped into the flood one after another! The flood was spitting out thousands of long tongues to devour them! Zhang Guotian was knocked down by the waves, Zhang Wenzhi was overturned, and even Zhang Hengzhi, who was always called "Tank," was knocked down and drank water. However, no one climbed back halfway; they all tightly hugged the sleepers, rolling and fighting in the flood. Sometimes the sleepers pressed down on people, sometimes people pressed down on the sleepers; in the flood, it was no longer clear who was a person and who was a sleeper.
    "Hold on tight, don't let go! We can't build a bridge without a sleeper!" This voice came from the waves. Before this person finished speaking, he was about to be washed away by the waves. The rescuers working downstream quickly rushed forward and rescued him. His legs had been cut and were bleeding, but he was holding on to a sleeper and had not let go.
    The rescue work was successfully completed, but people did not rest. As dusk approached, the clanging of iron hammers rang out again. It started to rain again, and the raindrops hit the rails, making a sound. In such weather, enemy planes still came to harass. They circled a few times and hung up a few flares overhead, illuminating the sky brightly, but the heroes continued to work under the slogan of "Traffic will continue as usual tonight!"
    At two o'clock in the night, the long whistle came from the bridgehead again. The long train, as in the past, rumbled across this heroic bridge and rushed to the front lines!

    在英雄桥畔
        张志民
    在朝鲜前线，我们住在一座铁桥的近旁。在这里，不分白昼黑夜，不论晴天雨天，你都可以听到敌机的声音。要问敌人对这座桥梁用过多少方法来破坏——说不完，要问敌人把这座桥梁炸毁过多少次——记不清。但是，我知道有一件事，那就是每到天近黄昏的时候，你就可以看到长长的列车，一列列地从这座桥上驰过，那雄壮的汽笛声震撼着四野和山谷。坚守在桥头的建路勇士们，无论工作得如何疲惫，他们还是站起来，鼓着掌，兴奋地望着那满载着粮食和弹药的列车驰向前线。
    我们的英雄们是怎样在创造着奇迹呢？战斗在这里的某铁路部队徐政治委员告诉我说：“在我们这里，做一个突出的英雄是很不容易的！因为在这里每一个人都有他英雄的事迹。”徐政治委员也像他的部队一样，英雄而年轻，在他每次谈到工作中的困难时，同时就转动着他那双智慧的眼睛，说一句：“有办法！”他望一望那些正在工作中的战士们，对我说：“这些战士都是金子，每个人都会放射出灿烂的光辉。在我们的心上再没有什么比他们更可贵的了！”他是这样地热爱战士！几天前，有一位战士在抢修桥梁时被敌机扫射牺牲了，他甚至一夜没睡好觉。
    桥，在整个朝鲜战场上起着十分重要的作用。说起来它不过才百十公尺长，但是如果有半公尺断了就不能通车，就会影响我们的胜利。正因为这样，美国强盗才想出种种恶毒的方法来破坏它。桥的前后左右都布满了大大小小的炸弹坑，钢梁上有数不清的伤疤。什么大炸弹、小炸弹、子母雷、定时炸弹，美国强盗把所有的这些武器都拿出来了。
    是三月上旬的一个夜晚，风卷着雪花像刀一样刺在人们的脸上，地面上的积雪冻得人们两脚麻木。就在这天晚上，敌人的飞机投下了一颗一千磅重的定时炸弹，正好落在一座桥墩旁边。这是一个凶恶的家伙！要是它一旦爆炸了，这座桥就会被炸坏，而且不是一天两天可以修好的。要是运输中断了，那对我们的战争的影响是很大的。
    人们都急了。战士们纷纷提出要求，要舍身去搬走定时炸弹。就在这个时候，有一个黑影已经由岸边向水中蠕动。那是谁？是共产党员王国璋，这个还有些孩子气的二十二岁的青年，已经开始他的英雄行动了。
    水是一公尺半深，水上还浮着薄冰。炸弹不是在水面，而是潜在水中，究竟在那个地方，还要钻进水里去摸。王国璋一入水，混身就冻成紫的了，全身都在打战，冷得喘不过气来；但是，他的一颗心却是火热的。这颗火热的心燃烧着他，鼓舞着他，使他奋不顾身地去努力完成这个危险的任务。岸上的同志们要去替换他，都被他拒绝了。他想，万一定时炸弹炸了，也不要再多牺牲一位同志。他在水里沉着地摸了许久，摸到了！他把身上带的绳子套在炸弹的环上，向同志们喊：“拉呀！”绳子从河里到岸边绷直了，但是岸上的同志们用力一拉，绳子却脱落了。王国璋从容地又把绳子套好，同志们才继续把炸弹拉到岸边，这时，定时炸弹爆炸了，我们的桥梁却安然无恙。望着远远开来的我们的列车，英雄们的兴奋是难以形容的。
    当祖国的铁路职工慰问团在朝鲜访问王国璋同志时，问他：“你拉定时炸弹时，是否想到它一爆炸你就会牺牲呢？”他回答说：“当时我只想到：只要它一爆炸，桥就会被炸坏，我们不能通车，不知道要造成多大的损失！”
    将要进入秋季的时候，朝鲜的雨季来了。
    雨连日下个不停，大小山沟都是洪水猛涨，高大的浪头翻滚着。这比战斗情况还要紧急！在桥头担任监视的岗哨，不停地用电话向首长报告着水位。一公尺半，一公尺七，两公尺，两公尺半……快要没桥了……听到了这样的情况，政治委员自语着：“这是个更凶恶的敌人！”
    的确，洪水是个更凶恶的敌人！它像猛兽一样地叫啸着，像大海一样地翻腾着。岸边的稻田被淹没了；高粱只露着个头在摇摆；岸边的小松树闪了几闪就被连根拔掉了；桥，眼看着就要被洪水吞没，用枕木架起的排架，歪了，倒了，被冲走了。
    还有比这更紧急的任务吗？一秒钟也不能等待！因为那些枕木在急流中每秒钟都能被冲跑几公尺。这是非常紧急的任务！因为愈是在洪水泛滥、交通线受到损害的时候，我们的前方愈是需要物资的保证。桥，无论如何是不能断的！
    “跳下去呀，抢枕木！抢材料！”在政治指导员陈玉明领导下，共产党员张国田跳下去了，张文志跳下去了，伤势未愈的秦国也跳下去了……英雄们一个个地投入了洪水中去！那洪水吐着千万条长舌在吞食着他们！张国田被波浪打倒了，张文志被打翻了，连那素来被人叫做“坦克”的张恒志也被浪头打倒喝了水。但是，并没有一个人从半途中爬回来，他们都紧紧地抱着枕木在洪水中翻滚着，奋斗着。有时枕木压住了人，有时人压住了枕木；在洪水中已经分不清那是人，那是枕木了。
    “抓住了，可不能松手啊！缺一块枕木也搭不起桥来！”这个声音从波浪里传出来，这个人的话还没说完，眼看着他就要给波浪冲走了，在下游工作的抢救队员连忙赶上前去，把他救了上来，他的腿已被碰得鲜血淋漓，但是他却抱着一根枕木没有放手。
    抢救工作胜利地完成了，人们并没有去休息。在天近黄昏的时候，叮当的铁锤声又响起来了。天又落起雨来，雨点打在轨道上发着响声。就在这样的天气，敌机依然来骚扰，它盘旋了几个圈子就在头顶上挂起了几颗照明弹，照得天空透亮，但英雄们在“今夜仍要照常通车！”的口号下，依然坚持工作下去。
    夜晚两点钟的时候，悠长的汽笛声又从桥头上传来了。那长列的火车像往日一样，又从这英雄的桥梁上轰隆隆地驶过，向前线奔驰而去了！
