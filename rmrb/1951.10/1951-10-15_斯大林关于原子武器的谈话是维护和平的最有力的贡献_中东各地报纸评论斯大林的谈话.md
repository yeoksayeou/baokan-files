Xinhua News Agency, October 14th:

    Middle Eastern newspapers have published and commented on Stalin's remarks to a Pravda correspondent regarding atomic weapons.
    Iran's "Bisui Ayandeh" wrote in an editorial: "Stalin's speech is a powerful blow to the abhorrent atomic diplomacy and the conspiracies of the Anglo-American warmongers." The newspaper said: "Stalin's speech shows that although the Soviet Union is strong in atomic weapons and is not afraid of enemies, it is also very firm and wise in consistently advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons." An editorial in Iran's "Maslahat" stated: "Marshal Stalin's clear statement this time has aroused great joy and excitement among supporters of the peace camp."
    Lebanon's "Al-Sharq," "Daily News," "Al-Amal," "Al-Jarida," "Al-Sayba," and "Al-Alam" all published Stalin's speech. Many newspapers also published Stalin's photo. "Al-Sharq" used the headline: "Stalin Makes Extremely Important Speech on the Soviet Union's Manufacture of Atomic Bombs. Stalin Says: We Have No Intention of Attacking the United States or Any Other Country. The Anglo-American Bloc, Which Pursues a Policy of Aggression, Threatens Other Countries with Atomic Bombs and Hopes to Monopolize Atomic Bombs."
    All newspapers in Cyprus published Stalin's speech. Papaioannou, General Secretary of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, said in an interview with a reporter from the Athens News Agency: "Stalin's speech on atomic weapons is the most powerful contribution to maintaining peace."
    Radio stations in Damascus, Syria, Beirut, Lebanon, Amman, Transjordan, and Cyprus broadcast the full text of Stalin's speech several times.

    中东各地报纸评论斯大林的谈话
    【新华社十四日讯】中东各地的报纸刊登和评论斯大林关于原子武器对真理报记者的谈话。
    伊朗“比苏·阿扬第报”在社论中写道：“斯大林的谈话是对于那些令人痛恨的原子外交以及英美战争贩子的阴谋的一个有力的打击。”该报说：“斯大林在谈话中表明：苏联虽然在原子武器方面是强大的，而且是不怕敌人的，但同时却非常坚定而英明地一贯主张禁止原子武器。”伊朗“马斯拉哈特报”的社论说：“斯大林大元帅这次明确的谈话，已引起和平阵营拥护者们的极大喜悦和兴奋。”
    黎巴嫩的“东方报”、“日报”、“阿尔·阿马尔报”、“邻人报”、“阿尔·塞巴报”和“军旗报”都刊登了斯大林的谈话。很多报纸还刊登了斯大林的照片。“东方报”所用的标题是：“斯大林发表关于苏联制造原子弹的极其重要的谈话。斯大林说：我们没有进攻美国或其他任何国家的想法。奉行侵略政策的英美集团用原子弹威胁其他国家，他们希望垄断原子弹。”
    塞浦路斯各报都登载了斯大林的谈话。塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党总书记巴巴伊奥亚诺在接见电通社记者时说：“斯大林关于原子武器的谈话是维护和平最有力的贡献。”
    叙利亚大马士革、黎巴嫩贝鲁特、外约旦安曼和塞浦路斯的电台曾把斯大林的谈话全文广播了好几遍。
