    The Anti-Imperialist Movement of the People in the Near and Middle East is Rising
    Iraqi People Demand the Abolition of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty
    Oppose Participation in the So-Called "Joint Defense" System of American and British Imperialism
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] Following Egypt's decision to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, the Iraqi people are demanding the abolition of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty signed in 1930. According to Lebanon's "Telegraph" news: The Iraqi opposition parties "Independence Party," "People's United Front," and "National Democratic Party" held a joint meeting and decided to demand the abolition of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The meeting also decided that Iraq should refuse to participate in the so-called "joint defense" system of American and British imperialism.
    Under the demands of the Iraqi people, the Iraqi government decided on the 11th to demand that Britain revise the 1930 treaty. According to the treaty, Britain has the right to occupy the two largest Iraqi military airfields, Habbaniyah and Shaiba, and station troops nearby. Thus, Britain effectively controls Iraq.
    The British ruling clique is extremely shocked by the demands of the Iraqi people, because the demands of the Iraqi government are the "third lightning strike" against the British government after Iran and Egypt, and may be "contagious," shaking the entire rule of British imperialism in the Near and Middle East.

    中近东人民反帝国主义运动日益高涨
    伊拉克人民要求废除英伊条约
    反对参加美英帝国主义所谓“联防”体系
    【新华社十八日讯】继埃及决定废除一九三六年英埃条约之后，伊拉克人民要求废除一九三○年签订的英伊条约。据黎巴嫩“电讯报”消息：伊拉克反对党“独立党”、“人民联合阵线”和“国家民主党”曾举行联席会议，决定要求废除一九三○年的英伊条约。会议并决定：伊拉克应拒绝参加美英帝国主义所谓“联防”体系。
    在伊拉克人民的要求下，伊拉克政府已在十一日决定要求英国修改一九三○年的条约。根据该条约，英国有权占领哈班尼雅和塞巴两个伊拉克最大的军用飞机场，并得在附近驻扎陆军。这样，英国就实际上掌握了对伊拉克的控制权。
    英国统治集团对伊拉克人民的要求极为震惊，因为伊拉克政府的要求，是继伊朗与埃及之后，对英国政府的“第三个闪电打击”，而且可能“具有传染性”，动摇英帝国主义在中近东的整个统治。
