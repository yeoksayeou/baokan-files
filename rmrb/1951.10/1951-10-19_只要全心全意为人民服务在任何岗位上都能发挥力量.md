    As Long as You Serve the People Wholeheartedly, You Can Exert Strength in Any Position
    To the Editor:
    The article "Set an Example and Resolutely Complete the Transportation Task" published in the People's Daily on October 5th gave me great inspiration and education. I am a university student. I love my motherland, the people, and the learning environment. I hope to dedicate my life to serving the motherland and the people.
    In the previous movement to join the military cadre school, I still thought that staying to study would allow me to better serve the people in the future. However, after seeing the brief introduction of the hero Song Shanmu, I felt very ashamed of myself. I realized that my previous thinking was essentially a selfish consideration of my own gains and losses. A person who truly serves the people wholeheartedly can exert their greatest strength in any work position. For example, Comrade Song Shanmu was a labor model in the rear and a transportation hero at the front. I must learn from the heroes, strive to cultivate myself into a person who truly serves the people wholeheartedly, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and go where the people need me most!

### 只要全心全意为人民服务在任何岗位上都能发挥力量

    只要全心全意为人民服务在任何岗位上都能发挥力量编辑同志：
    人民日报十月五日登载的“以身作则，坚决完成运输任务”一文，给了我很大的启发和教育。我是一个大学生，我爱我的祖国、人民和学习环境。我希望用我的一生为祖国、为人民服务。
    在前次参加军事干部学校的运动中，我还认为留下学习，以后可以更好地为人民服务。然而当我看到对宋善牧英雄的简单介绍后，我自己感到非常惭愧，我发觉到自己过去的那种想法，实质上是在考虑自己得失的一种自私想法。一个真正全心全意为人民服务的人，在任何工作岗位上，都能发挥他最大的力量。如宋善牧同志，在后方是一位劳动模范，在前方又是一位运输英雄。我一定要向英雄们学习，努力将自己培养成一个真正全心全意为人民服务的人，随时准备着响应祖国的号召，到人民最需要我的地方去！沙潭
