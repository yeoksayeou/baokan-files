    Strengthen the Study and Promotion of the Marriage Law
    ——Reflections on Reading "Guaranteeing Women's Freedom of Marriage"

To the Editor:

    After reading the People's Daily article "Guaranteeing Women's Freedom of Marriage" on September 1st, I was very moved. It has been over a year since the Marriage Law was promulgated. Although there has been some success in implementing the Marriage Law in various regions, it cannot be said that there are no shortcomings. The article "Guaranteeing Women's Freedom of Marriage" tells us that in just one year, there have been tens of thousands of women killed or committing suicide due to marriage problems in the Central South region alone. This is a shocking figure and a serious phenomenon. The reason this serious phenomenon still exists is that the deeply rooted feudal ideology among the masses is an important factor; however, I believe that the failure of cadres to pay attention to publicizing the Marriage Law and to struggle against erroneous ideas in women's issues and marriage issues is also an important reason for the phenomenon of women's suicide and murder. Some cadres themselves still have feudal ideas, which of course makes it even more difficult to correctly implement the Marriage Law. In order to correct the serious phenomenon of mistreatment and killing of women, I suggest that all regions immediately organize district and village cadres to study the Marriage Law, check the local implementation of the Marriage Law, and, as needed, use public places such as people's schools to publicize the Marriage Law to the masses, in order to eliminate feudal ideas and correctly implement the Marriage Law.

### 加强学习与宣传婚姻法——“保障妇女的婚姻自由”一文读后感

    加强学习与宣传婚姻法
    ——“保障妇女的婚姻自由”一文读后感编辑同志：
    读九月一日人民日报“保障妇女的婚姻自由”一文后，我十分激动。婚姻法已经颁布一年多了，虽然各地贯彻执行婚姻法有一定成绩，但不能不说仍有缺点。“保障妇女的婚姻自由”一文告诉我们，一年中，仅中南区为婚姻问题而被杀、自杀的妇女就有万人。这是一个惊人的数字，是一种严重的现象。这种严重现象之所以仍旧存在，群众中的根深蒂固的封建思想是重要因素；但是，我认为，干部不注意宣传婚姻法，不对妇女问题、婚姻问题中的错误思想进行斗争，也是造成妇女自杀被杀现象的重要原因。某些干部，本身还有封建思想，当然更难正确贯彻婚姻法。为了纠正虐待、杀害妇女的严重现象，我建议各地应立即组织区村干部学习婚姻法，检查当地执行婚姻法的情况，并根据需要，利用民校等公共场合，向群众宣传婚姻法，以便肃清封建思想，正确执行婚姻法。
