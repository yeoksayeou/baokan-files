Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th—The donations from all ethnic groups in the Northwest region for airplanes and cannons have now reached over 99.2 billion yuan, completing over 45.6% of the six-month donation plan. Among them, the 1.5 million people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province, driven by the in-depth reporting of the first sub-group of the Comfort Mission to Korea, had already paid 5.9 billion yuan by early September, exceeding the donation task of three fighter planes. The people of Xi'an City have now paid over 20.4 billion yuan. The city's business community is actively adopting methods such as reducing costs and expanding operations to enthusiastically make donations to the treasury. For example, Dechanghao, a mountain product business, with the joint efforts of labor and management, increased its turnover by a quarter from June to September. They voluntarily increased their pledged donation from 40 million yuan to 60 million yuan and paid it all into the treasury. As of now, the total amount of donations from the city's business community has reached 92% of the pledged plan for ten fighter planes, and they have decided to pay off the remaining amount on October 25th—the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the Korean War. The people of Gansu Province have paid over 44.7 billion yuan. The Tibetan people of Tianzhu Autonomous Region in the province completed the donation task for the "Tianzhu" fighter plane as early as August. In mid-September, the Lanzhou business community launched a donation competition with the business communities of other provinces and cities in the Northwest and guaranteed to pay off the donation for six fighter planes by the end of November. The people of Shaanxi Province have paid over 14.4 billion yuan. After the bumper harvest of cotton farmers in the Guanzhong area of the province, farmers are enthusiastically making donations. The people of Xinjiang Province, a remote area in the Northwest, have also paid over 10.5 billion yuan, and the 800,000 people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia Province have donated 3.3 billion yuan.

During the donation, patriotic Buddhist leaders and democratic figures of all ethnic groups in the Northwest were also very enthusiastic. Panchen Erdeni donated 130 million yuan. Gong Tangcang Jiayang of Labrang Monastery in Gansu Province, in addition to donating 500 sheep, 100 cattle, and 500 cowhides, also personally went deep into various tribes and monasteries to promote the donation movement. Vice Chairman Xiraojiacuo of Qinghai Province promoted the donation of 130 million yuan by all monks of Ta'er Monastery in Huangzhong and Guanghui Monastery in Datong. Gao Guizi, a member of the China Democratic League, paid off all the funds for donating a fighter plane in Xi'an on National Day.
