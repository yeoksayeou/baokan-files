    Fucik Will Always Live in Our Hearts
    To the Editor:
    I contracted a lung disease and am lying in a hospital bed. I received "Report from the Gallows" from a classmate and read it page by page. Julius told me that in our dictionary, there is no word "difficulty", but rather "optimistic struggle." Whenever I have a fever and feel troubled, it's as if I can hear Julius smiling and saying to me: "I love life and fight for it. I love you, people... I was born for joy and die for joy."
    In October 1950, when the American imperialist aggressors arrogantly shouted "Strike across the Yalu River," we angrily swore: "If the bloody claws of American imperialism extend to the land of our motherland, we will bite them off with our teeth; if the American imperialist aggressors dare to ignite the flames of war on the north bank of the Yalu River, we will extinguish them with our blood." More than 95% of the students in our school signed up to join the Volunteer Army (we were too young and were not approved to go). Following that, we were swept up in the wave of joining military cadre schools. Eight students from our class of thirty-five embarked on the glorious posts of national defense construction.
    What power makes us so brave? It is because we have infinite hatred for the enemy and infinite love for a happy and peaceful life. We cherish peace as we cherish our own eyes, therefore, we study hard in our current positions, preparing to serve the motherland.
    I love Julius Fucik, just like I love our own hero Liu Hulan. He will always live with us, living in our hearts.

### 伏契克永远活在我们的心里

    伏契克永远活在我们的心里编辑同志：
    我生了肺病，躺在医院的病床上。我接到同学送来的“绞索套着脖子时的报告”，一页一页地看下去。尤利斯告诉我，在我们的字典上没有“困难”这个字样，有的是“乐观的战斗”。每当我发烧和烦恼的时候，就好像听到尤利斯微笑着对我说：“我爱生活，并且为它而战斗。我爱你们，人们……我为欢乐而生，为欢乐而死。”
    一九五○年十月，当着美帝国主义侵略者狂妄地高喊着“打过鸭绿江”时，我们愤怒地宣誓：“如果美帝国主义血腥的魔爪伸到我们祖国的土地上，我们将用牙齿把它咬断；如果美帝国主义侵略者敢把战火燃烧到鸭绿江北岸，我们将用热血将它扑灭。”我们学校百分之九十五以上的同学报名参加志愿军（我们年纪小，没有被批准去）。紧跟着我们又卷进参加军事干部学校的浪潮。我们班三十五人中有八位同学走上了光荣的国防建设岗位。
    什么力量使得我们这样勇敢呢？这是因为我们对敌人有无限的恨，对幸福和平生活有无限的爱。我们像珍贵自己的眼睛一样地珍贵和平，因此，我们在现在的岗位上努力学习，准备为祖国服务。
    我爱尤利斯·伏契克，就和爱我们自己的英雄刘胡兰一样，他永远和我们生活在一起，活在我们的心里。
