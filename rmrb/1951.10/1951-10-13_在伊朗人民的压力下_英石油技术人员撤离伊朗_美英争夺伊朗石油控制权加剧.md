    Xinhua News Agency, October 11th: Under pressure from the Iranian people, the last group of over 300 British technicians from the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company remaining in Iran were forced to withdraw from the Abadan refinery in Iran on October 3rd.
    Since the Iranian government announced the implementation of the oil nationalization law on June 21st, British technicians have not only refused to be employed by Iran, but have also continued to occupy the oil fields in Khuzestan. These British personnel have not only obstructed the implementation of Iranian oil nationalization, but have also sabotaged the equipment of the oil industry. On September 25th, the Iranian government ordered British technicians to leave Iran before midnight on October 3rd. Although British warships had arrived near Abadan long ago, attempting to carry out armed intervention, Britain had to withdraw its technicians within the limited time due to the power of the unity of the Iranian people.
    The forced withdrawal of British technicians from Iran this time is another manifestation of the extreme fragility of British imperialism. Conservative Party leader Eden said in a campaign speech in Leamington on the 5th that the evolution of the Iranian oil issue was a "major humiliation and failure" for the British. He said: "We don't need to make a fuss; the cold facts are clear enough. The foundation of our policy towards vast territories in Asia is now in crisis." Although the Labor government tried to defend its failure, it could not list any strong arguments.
    The withdrawal of British technicians also shows the intensification of the struggle between Britain and the United States for control of Iranian oil. According to a United Press report, some high-ranking figures in Britain believe that Britain "was abandoned by its allies" during the most tense stage of the Iranian oil issue. The United States "did not approve of the use of force to prevent British oil workers from being expelled from Abadan." According to a Reuters report, concurrently with the withdrawal of British technicians, more than 1,000 American oil technicians have applied to the Iranian authorities to work in the Iranian oil fields.

    Xinhua News Agency, October 11th: According to a TASS report from Tehran, when Iranian British technicians were sent to Basra, Iraq, residents of Basra held demonstrations against British imperialism. Basra police arrested many of the demonstrators.

### 在伊朗人民的压力下  英石油技术人员撤离伊朗  美英争夺伊朗石油控制权加剧

    在伊朗人民的压力下
    英石油技术人员撤离伊朗
    美英争夺伊朗石油控制权加剧
    【新华社十一日讯】留在伊朗的前英伊石油公司的最后一批英国技术人员三百多人，已在十月三日被迫自伊朗的阿巴丹炼油厂撤退。
    从六月二十一日伊朗政府宣布实施石油国有化法以来，英国的技术人员一面拒绝受雇于伊朗，同时继续盘踞在库齐斯坦的油田中。这些英国人不仅阻挠伊朗石油国有化的实施，并且在破坏石油工业的设备。九月二十五日，伊朗政府下令英国技术人员在十月三日午夜以前离开伊朗。虽然英国的军舰很早就开到阿巴丹附近，妄图进行武力干涉，但是，由于伊朗人民团结的力量，英国不得不在限定的期限内，撤退了技术人员。
    这次英国技术人员的被迫撤出伊朗，是英国帝国主义极端脆弱的又一表现。保守党魁首艾登五日在莱明吞发表竞选演说时说：伊朗石油问题的演变，对英国人说来，是一个“重大的丢脸和失败”。他说：“我们不必说大惊小怪的话，冷酷的事实是够明白的。我们对亚洲广大领地的政策的基础现在已处于危机中。”工党政府虽然力图为它的失败辩护，但列举不出任何有力的论据来。
    英国技术人员的撤退也表现了英美之间争夺伊朗石油控制权的斗争加剧。据合众社消息：英国一些地位很高的人士认为：正在伊朗石油问题最紧张的阶段，英国“被它的盟友遗弃了”。美国曾“不赞成使用武力来防止英国石油工作人员被逐出阿巴丹”。另据路透社消息：与英国技术人员撤退的同时，已有一千多名美国石油技师向伊朗当局要求在伊朗油田工作。
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰消息：当伊朗的英国技术人员被送到伊拉克的巴士拉时，巴士拉的居民举行了反对英帝国主义的示威游行。巴士拉的警察逮捕了许多游行的群众。
