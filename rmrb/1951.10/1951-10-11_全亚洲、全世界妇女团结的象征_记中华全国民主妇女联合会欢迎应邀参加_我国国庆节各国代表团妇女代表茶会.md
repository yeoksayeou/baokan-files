    Symbol of Solidarity Among Women in All of Asia and the World
    -- On the Tea Party Held by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to Welcome Women Representatives of Various Countries' Delegations Invited to Attend Our National Day

    On October 6th, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a grand reception and tea party to welcome the women representatives of various countries' delegations who were invited to attend our National Day celebrations. This was a rare gathering; sisters from eleven countries, including sisters from the Soviet Union, Eastern European People's Democratic countries, and Asian countries, gathered together with some outstanding representatives of Chinese women. They expressed a common desire in different languages of various ethnic groups: We must unite to defend lasting world peace!

    At the meeting, Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, used vivid and specific examples to introduce to the guests the development of Chinese women's organizations in the past two years, the enthusiastic participation of Chinese women in the construction of the motherland, and the active participation of Chinese women in the struggle to defend world peace. When she talked about various tasks, she introduced on the spot the representatives of the relevant tasks who were present. For example, when talking about women's participation in democratic nation-building, she introduced the female members of the Beijing Municipal Government, female district heads, and female court presidents who attended the tea party. This real, vivid, and lively reporting method left a deep impression on everyone present: How great are the women of New China, how rich is the life of the women of New China, and how promising is the future of the women of New China!

    When Comrade Deng Yingchao reported that the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, through women's representative conferences, had connected with organized women masses reaching 76 million people, this huge number attracted great attention from representatives of various countries. The representative of Hungary said: This is more than eight times the total population of Hungary, which is nine million.

    Comrade Deng Yingchao introduced the participation of Chinese women in various construction projects. She said: Chinese women are brave and hardworking. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong, they have overcome the ferocious enemies at home and abroad and established the People's Republic of China. As early as during the Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War, women in the liberated areas actively and massively participated in various production tasks, making great contributions to ensuring the supply of military and civilian needs and supporting the victory of the war. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, they participated in various construction projects of the motherland with even greater enthusiasm, becoming an indispensable force. In various tasks, they have shown a high degree of initiative and creativity. Female labor models have emerged in batches from various work posts. In factories, there have appeared labor models like Hao Jianxiu who improved production technology with a new labor attitude; in rural areas, one-third of the agricultural labor models in Pingyuan Province are women. In addition, in the past two years, nearly one million women have participated in the repair and dredging projects of the Grand Canal, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Huai River. In this year's great project of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River, many women have won the glorious title of Special-Class Huai River Harnessing Heroes, and Gan Caihua, who is present, is one of them. When Gan Caihua was introduced to the guests and stood up, representatives from various countries applauded warmly.

    However, the reason why Chinese women can participate in the construction of the motherland in large numbers is not only because the country's laws guarantee their equal status and rights with men, but also because of the improvement of working conditions and the development of children's welfare undertakings. Now, the labor insurance regulations have been widely implemented in major factories across the country, and there are more than 11,200 children's welfare organizations across the country, with nearly 500,000 children receiving care. According to incomplete statistics, more than 90,000 old midwives have been transformed across the country, greatly reducing the mortality rate of mothers and infants. Comrade Deng Yingchao earnestly told friends from various countries: We have done some work in the past two years, but it is still far from meeting actual needs. Moreover, we are not without difficulties in carrying out the above-mentioned work. The deep-rooted influence of the feudal society's patriarchal ideas and customs that have lasted for thousands of years, and the war wounds that have not yet recovered for many years, the war against the aggression of American imperialism and the war to support Korea have not ended. Our work is arduous, but we have the confidence to overcome difficulties and move forward victoriously!

    Chinese women actively participate in the struggle to defend peace. Their enthusiastic efforts in the peace signature campaign and donation campaign, and their donation of 59 airplanes by means of production and saving, and the women of Guangzhou donating a fighter plane at the welcome meeting for the returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, these touching examples are highly admired by representatives of various countries. Especially when talking about the moving stories of the outstanding sons and daughters working on the Korean front, the representatives of various countries were deeply moved. At this time, Comrade Deng Yingchao pointed to Comrades Che Shuqin, Jiang Shuhua, and Liu Xiuzhen and said, these are the three female representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers who returned to participate in the National Day celebration. The entire audience stood up spontaneously with admiration to pay their respects, and gave prolonged and enthusiastic applause and cheers. This kind of love of the sisters from various countries for the female soldiers who fought heroically for peace moved many people to tears! Comrade Deng Yingchao used an enthusiastic and excited voice to make a request to the female representatives of the People's Volunteers on behalf of everyone: Ask the three of them to bring the love and condolences of the sisters from various countries to the Chinese People's Volunteers to the front line, and to our heroic men and women, saying: The peace-loving women of the world are your backing! Following this voice, the entire audience once again set off warm and lasting applause!

    Halfway through the meeting, a team of lively and lovely children, holding clusters of flowers, shone in front of people's eyes, and the song "People of the World Are of One Heart" was played on the loudspeaker. These were the children from the nursery, and they came to present flowers to the foreign aunts. The foreign aunts were so happy that they couldn't close their mouths one by one, and hugged them in their arms, kissing the little faces of the New China children full of happiness. Facing these lovely children, people realized a sacred responsibility to resolutely fight for peace for their happy future.

    Then, representatives from various countries spoke one after another. Trofiminka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union of Cultural and Educational Workers, said: "The achievements of the Chinese people and women in just two years are not accidental. Comrade Deng Yingchao's report more kindly tells us how Chinese women are fighting for their happy lives. We Soviet women are concerned and admire your achievements, and will always be the best friends of the Chinese people, standing unswervingly at the forefront of the struggle for peace!" Mrs. Hanna Sen, Chairman of the All India Women's Conference, earnestly said: "Chinese women and Indian women have a common goal, that goal is to make the women of the two countries join hands to fight for peace. Let me extend the warmest hand on behalf of Indian women to express their willingness to fight together with the women of China." She tightly held Comrade Deng Yingchao's hand and said: "Let us expand this close friendship to the whole of Asia, and make us more closely united!"

    Then, representatives from Hungary, Burma, Mongolia, and the German Democratic Republic spoke one after another. They expressed their lofty respect for Chinese women who have made achievements in building their motherland and defending peace with different languages and sincere feelings. The women representatives of Asian countries more earnestly expressed their desire to learn from the experience of Chinese women's struggle. They unanimously expressed their desire for peace and their confidence in winning peace. Finally, Romanian representative Ileana Rachianu presented many letters from Romanian women to Chinese women to Vice-Chairman Deng Yingchao.

    The welcome meeting ended in this warm and friendly atmosphere. When the distinguished guests from various countries shook hands and said goodbye to the hosts, everyone had a common feeling: Today's grand meeting is a symbol of the close unity of Asian women and women from all countries in the world, and this unity will add infinite strength to the world's peace movement.

    全亚洲、全世界妇女团结的象征
    ——记中华全国民主妇女联合会欢迎应邀参加
    我国国庆节各国代表团妇女代表茶会
    十月六日，中华全国民主妇女联合会举行了一个盛大的招待茶会，欢迎应邀参加我国国庆节庆祝典礼的各国代表团的妇女代表。这是一次难得的聚会；十一个国家的姊妹，包括来自苏联、东欧人民民主国家和亚洲国家的姊妹们，和中国妇女中的一些优秀的代表们，欢聚在一堂。她们用各民族不同的语言表达了共同的愿望：我们要团结起来，保卫世界持久和平！
    在会上，中华全国民主妇联副主席邓颖超同志用生动具体的例子，向贵宾们介绍了两年来中国妇女组织的发展情况，中国妇女热烈参加祖国建设的工作情况，以及中国妇女积极参加保卫世界和平的斗争情况。当她谈到各项工作时，就当场介绍了在座的各该项工作的代表人物，例如谈到妇女参加民主建政的情况，她就随着介绍了参加茶会的北京市的政府女委员、女区长、女法院院长等人物。这种真人真事、生动活泼的报告方法，给与会的每个人留下了深刻的印象：新中国妇女是多么伟大，新中国妇女的生活内容是多么丰富，新中国妇女的前程是多么的远大！
    当邓颖超同志报告到全国民主妇女联合会通过妇女代表会议联系的有组织的妇女群众，已达七千六百万人的时候，这个巨大的数字引起了各国代表的很大的注意。匈牙利的代表说：这比匈牙利全国人口总数九百万的八倍还多。
    邓颖超同志介绍了中国妇女参加各种建设工作的情况，她说：中国妇女是勇敢、勤劳的，她们和中国人民一起在伟大的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，战胜了国内外的凶恶的敌人，建立起中华人民共和国。远在抗日战争时期和人民解放战争时期，各解放区的妇女就积极地、大批地参加了各项生产工作，在保证军需民用的供给上，在支援战争的胜利上，作了很大的贡献。中华人民共和国成立之后，她们更以无限的热情参加了祖国的各种建设工作，成为一种不可缺少的力量。在各种工作中，她们表现了高度的积极性和创造性，女劳动模范从各种工作岗位上一批一批地涌现出来。在工厂中出现了郝建秀那样以新的劳动态度改进生产技术的劳动模范；在农村中，平原省的农业劳动模范中有三分之一是妇女。此外，两年来，还有近百万的妇女参加了运河、长江、黄河、淮河等修导工程，在今年根治淮河的伟大工程中，不少妇女获得了特等治淮功臣的光荣称号，在座的甘彩华就是其中之一。当甘彩华被介绍给贵宾们而站起来的时候，各国代表们报以热烈的鼓掌。
    但是，中国妇女之所以能够大量地参加到祖国建设中来，这除了因为国家的法律保障了她们和男子平等的地位和权利以外，是与劳动条件的改善和儿童福利事业的开展分不开的。现在劳动保险条例已在全国各大工厂普遍推行，儿童福利组织全国已有一万一千二百余处，受保育的儿童将近五十万。据不完全统计，全国改造了九万多旧产婆，使产妇与婴儿的死亡率就大为减少了。邓颖超同志恳切地告诉各国朋友说：两年来我们是做了一些工作，但离开实际需要还很远，而且在进行上述工作时，我们不是没有困难的，几千年封建社会重男轻女的思想残余和习俗的深固影响，以及多年战争创伤尚未恢复，反对美帝国主义的侵略、支援朝鲜的战争还没有结束，我们的工作是艰巨的，但我们有信心战胜困难胜利前进！
    中国妇女积极参加保卫和平的斗争，她们在和平签名运动、捐献运动中的热情努力，她们用生产节约各种方法捐献了飞机五十九架，广州市妇女在人民志愿军归国代表的欢迎会上，一次捐献了一架战斗机，这些动人的例子，是各国代表极为崇敬的。特别是在谈到朝鲜前线工作的优秀的儿女们的可歌可泣的故事的时候，使各国代表深受感动。这时候，邓颖超同志指着车书琴、姜淑华和刘秀珍三位同志说，这就是我们中国人民志愿军归国参加国庆典礼的三位女代表。全场都不约而同的以崇敬的心情起立致敬，并报以长久的热烈的鼓掌和欢呼。各国姊妹们这种对为和平而英勇斗争的女战士们的热爱，感动着许多人掉下泪来！邓颖超同志以热情激动的声音替大家向人民志愿军的女代表提出了要求：要求她们三位把今天各国姊妹对中国人民志愿军的热爱与慰问带到前线去，带给我们英勇的男女英雄们，说：全世界爱好和平的妇女是你们的后盾！随着这声音，全场又掀起了热烈的历久不息的掌声！
    会议进行到中间，一队活泼可爱的小朋友捧着一簇簇的鲜花闪耀在人们的眼前，扩音器里放出了“全世界人民心一条”的歌曲。这是托儿所的孩子们，她们来向外国阿姨们献花的。外国阿姨们乐得一个个合不拢嘴来，把她们抱在怀里，亲吻着充满了幸福的新中国儿童们的小脸。对着这些可爱的儿童，人们都意识到一种神圣的责任，要为着他们的幸福的将来，坚决为争取和平而斗争。
    接着各国代表纷纷发言。苏联文化教育工作者联合会中央委员会主席特罗菲敏卡说：“中国人民和妇女在短短两年中的成就，是并不偶然的。邓颖超同志的报告，更亲切地告诉我们，中国妇女怎样为自己的幸福生活在奋斗着。我们苏联妇女关切地崇敬着你们的成就，并且将始终成为中国人民最好的朋友，坚强不屈地站在争取和平斗争的前线！”印度全印妇女大会主席汉纳·森夫人恳切地说：“中国妇女和印度妇女有一个共同的目标，那个目标是要使两国妇女携起手来为和平而奋斗，让我代表印度妇女伸出最热烈的手来表示愿意和中国的妇女一起斗争。”她紧握着邓颖超同志的手说：“让我们这亲密的友谊扩大到全亚洲，使我们团结得更加紧密！”
    接着匈牙利、缅甸、蒙古、德意志民主共和国的代表相继发言。她们用不同的语言、真挚的感情表达了她们对正在建设祖国、保卫和平中已有成就的中国妇女的崇高敬意。亚洲国家的妇女代表更恳切地表示要向中国妇女学习斗争的经验，她们一致表示对和平的热望，以及对争取和平的胜利的信心。最后罗马尼亚代表伊丽安娜·拉契亚努把她带来的罗马尼亚妇女给中国妇女的许多信件献给了邓颖超副主席。
    欢迎会就在这热情友好的气氛中结束了。当各国贵宾们和主人握手告别时，大家都有一个共同的感觉：今天的盛会是亚洲妇女、世界各国妇女亲密团结的象征，这种团结将给世界保卫和平运动增加无限的力量。
