    Introduction to the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition
    The North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition grandly opened yesterday at the Tianjin Racecourse. This is an unprecedentedly large exhibition in the history of North China. The units participating in this conference in an organized manner include more than 10,000 farmer representatives, trade delegations from the five provinces of North China, Beijing and Tianjin, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and other major administrative regions. The economic purpose of this conference is to promote the sales of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products, especially to open up sales channels for slow-moving products, promote industrial and agricultural production, and further prosper the urban and rural economy. The political purpose of this conference is: through the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; to allow the people to see the abundance of our country's products from physical objects, models, and charts, and to see the victories we have achieved in our economic struggle against American imperialism, thereby further realizing the superiority of the New Democratic system and raising their patriotic ideological consciousness. This conference will organize various regions and cities to widely sign purchase and sales contracts, and organize the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in North China, between provinces in North China, between North China and major administrative regions, as well as at home and abroad this autumn and winter and next spring, in order to further consolidate and develop the commercial network. This conference uses various physical objects, charts, and written explanations to point out to people the origin, output, uses, specifications, prices, and sales channels of various agricultural, sideline, local, and special products, so that everyone knows what should be produced, how much should be produced, and how to produce it at present; what should be operated, how much should be operated, and how to operate it; thereby gradually overcoming the blindness of production and sales and enhancing planning. Workers can absorb many advanced experiences at this exhibition and further improve their production. Farmers will learn many scientific and technological knowledge and advanced experiences in agricultural production at this exhibition, in order to further increase the yield per unit area; and understand what raw materials are needed by urban industry, in order to increase the production of these raw materials. Urban industrial and commercial circles will take this opportunity to absorb a large number of farmers' criticisms and suggestions, understand the living and production needs of farmers, in order to further face the countryside, improve production, improve management, and gradually overcome shortcomings such as insufficient supply of industrial products, high prices, unsuitable quality, and untimely supply. During the conference, symposiums of urban agricultural scientific workers and agricultural production experts, urban and rural youth symposiums, and urban and rural women's symposiums will be organized to enable all parties to further understand and learn from each other, so as to strengthen unity. Symposiums will also be held between industrialists and businessmen from various places to observe each other, exchange experiences, and establish business relationships.
    This exhibition is divided into seventeen exhibition halls: Material Exchange Service Hall, Agricultural Production Materials Hall, Industrial and Commercial Improvement Hall, Inter-regional Hall, Mountain Dried and Fresh Goods Hall, Medicine Hall, Aquatic Products Hall, Animal Products Hall, Economic Crops Hall, Grain Hall, Overcoming Disaster Hall, Cotton Hall, Cotton Textile Hall, Agricultural Improvement Hall, Daily Necessities Hall, Handicraft Hall, and Heavy Industry Hall.
    In the Grain, Cotton, and Economic Crops halls, people can first see how rich North China and our country's agricultural products are. During the Kuomintang rule, our country always relied on foreign grain imports; only two years after the founding of New China, our country has basically become self-sufficient. In agricultural production in North China, unprecedented events have emerged in history, and the yield per unit area has been greatly increased. For example, Qu Yaoli produced more than 800 jin of seed cotton per mu of cotton, Li Shunda produced more than 900 jin per mu of corn, Guo Yunxiang produced more than 900 jin of millet per mu, and Ma Guorong produced 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. The production of cotton and economic crops such as tobacco, hemp, and peanuts has been generally restored. Cotton has exceeded the output before the Anti-Japanese War. These halls also tell farmers that they should vigorously increase the yield per unit area; they should grow more economic crops; and they should pay attention to selecting excellent varieties and adopting advanced scientific cultivation techniques.
    In the Overcoming Disaster Hall and the Agricultural Improvement Hall, people can see that the increase in agricultural production in North China has been obtained in the continuous and serious struggle against disasters such as water, drought, insects, and diseases, and it has been obtained in response to Chairman Mao's call to "organize" and gradually adopt scientific and technological means. In order to further develop agricultural production in the future, it is necessary to continue to carry forward these experiences and constantly create new experiences.
    The Agricultural Production Materials Hall points out to people the prospect of agricultural mechanization. It introduces the importance of improving production tools for the development of agricultural production, exhibits various improved farm tools and domestically produced tractors, and also introduces various effective pesticides and equipment, introduces excellent fertilizers, explains the needs of rural areas in North China for the above-mentioned items, and requires urban industry to supply the above-mentioned production materials in large quantities.
    The Mountain Dried and Fresh Goods, Medicine, Aquatic Products, and Animal Products halls show the abundance of our country's local products. North China's peach kernels, chestnuts, and hawthorns rank first in the world in terms of quality and output. With the development of domestic sales and the development of trade with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, the sales of these products have been basically resolved. Some products have experienced unprecedentedly brisk sales. In terms of medicinal materials, red mercury, penicillin, etc., which have always relied on imports in the past, can now be made by ourselves, and most of them can be self-sufficient. At present, in terms of animal products, it is necessary to promote excellent varieties, improve technology, increase production, and continue to expand domestic and foreign sales channels; in terms of aquatic products, it is necessary to pay attention to solving the problems of processing and marketing; mountain dried and fresh goods, etc., need to increase production and continue to improve quality. The Daily Necessities Hall, Cotton Textile Hall, and Heavy Industry Hall in the industrial sector point out to people the rapid development of industrial production in North China. For example, in terms of glass, 290,000 boxes were imported from foreign countries from 1947 to 1948, while 78,000 boxes were exported last year. Tianjin's weaving, dyeing, knitting, dyeing and finishing industries have all improved in production and operation. In these exhibition halls, the contrast exhibition of the past situation of some industrialists and businessmen deceiving farmers with crudely made products and the current changes gives people a strong impression. The Heavy Industry Hall focuses on exhibiting agricultural product processing machines and light industrial machines. The agricultural product processing machines exhibited in this hall are the latest type, simple in structure, and easy to use, and can be widely promoted in rural areas. The light industrial machines exhibited in this hall can change the handicraft production of some small and medium-sized cities, increase output and quality; they can also process industrial raw materials; the electrical part mainly exhibits electrical appliances suitable for small and medium-sized cities and towns, and at the same time points out the prospect of rural electrification and mechanization. The mineral products part, centered on coal and iron, introduces North China's rich coal and iron reserves, as well as advanced experiences and technologies in mining.
    The exhibits in the Handicraft Hall point out that among the industrial products used by farmers in various parts of North China, 80% are still handicrafts. In some areas, farmers rely on income from handicraft production as their main income. This situation shows that handicrafts still have development prospects in a fairly long period of time. However, it is urgently needed to organize and overcome the dispersion and backwardness in production and operation.
    The Industrial and Commercial Improvement Hall systematically introduces the great development and improvement of operation and management of public and private industrial and commercial enterprises under the guidance of the New Democratic economic policy, as well as typical deeds. Here are the development of industry and commerce in various parts of North China, the experience of various public and private factories in establishing various advanced management systems, and the great achievements of the working class in technological improvement since liberation. Many of these exhibits could not be manufactured in our country in the past.
    The Material Exchange Service Hall is the largest exhibition hall, comprehensively exhibiting the role of trade, cooperation, transportation, railways, post offices, telecommunications, taxation, finance, civil aviation and other aspects in material exchange. Through a series of charts, photographs, models, dioramas and slides, it focuses on explaining the leading role of the state-owned economy and the glorious achievements of the state-owned economy in serving material exchange with all its strength. In this exhibition hall, there are also many pictures opposing the economic blockade of American imperialism, pointing out to private industrialists and businessmen the direction and prospect of "facing the countryside and strengthening domestic sales."
    The Inter-regional Hall exhibits the products needed by the North China region and the products that can be supplied to various neighboring regions, as well as the materials of major administrative regions. In this hall, the main products exhibited in North China are glass, alkali, gauze, mountain goods, etc.; the exhibits in the Northeast region focus on steel, various heavy industrial products, wood, soybean cake, etc.; the East China region focuses on tea, silk, etc.; the Central and South China region focuses on rosin, ramie, tobacco, tung oil, etc.; the Northwest region focuses on sheepskin, rhubarb, etc.
    This conference will last for one and a half months and will end in late November.

    华北区城乡物资交流展览会介绍
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会，已于昨日在天津市跑马场隆重揭幕。这是华北区历史上空前盛大的展览会。有组织地参加这个大会的单位，有一万多农民代表，有华北五省，北京天津两市，内蒙古自治区和其他各大行政区的贸易代表团。这个大会在经济上的目的是：推销农业、副业、土产、特产产品，特别是为滞销产品开辟销路，推进工、农业生产，进一步繁荣城乡经济。这个大会在政治上的目的是：经过城乡物资交流，进一步巩固工农联盟；使人民从实物及模型、图表中，看到我国物产的丰饶，看到我国对美帝国主义进行经济斗争已得的胜利，从而进一步体会到新民主主义制度的优越性，提高爱国主义的思想觉悟。这个大会将组织各地区、各城市广泛地订立购销合同，组织今年秋冬和明年春季华北城乡之间、华北各省之间、华北和各大行政区之间以及国内外的物资交流，以进一步巩固和发展商业网。这个大会以各种实物、图表和文字说明，给人们指出各种农业、副业、土产、特产产品的产地、产量、用途、规格、价格与销路，使大家知道在目前应该生产什么，生产多少，怎样生产；经营什么，经营多少，怎样经营；从而逐渐克服产销上的盲目性，增强计划性。工人在这个展览会上，可以吸收许多先进经验，进一步提高自己的生产。农民在这个展览会上，将学得许多农业生产上的科学技术、知识与先进经验，以进一步提高单位面积产量；并了解城市工业需要什么原料，以增加这些原料的生产。城市工商界将借此机会，大量吸收农民的批评建议，了解农民的生活需要与生产需要，以进一步面向农村，改进生产，改进经营，逐渐克服工业品供应不足，价钱不便宜，质量不适用，供应不及时等缺点。在大会期间，将组织城市农业科学工作者和农业生产能手的座谈会，城乡青年座谈会和城乡妇女座谈会，使各方面进一步互相了解，互相学习，以加强团结。各地工商业者之间也将举行座谈会，互相观摩，交流经验，建立业务关系。
    这个展览会共分十七个展览馆：物资交流服务馆、农业生产资料馆、工商改进馆、区际馆、山干鲜货馆、药物馆、水产馆、畜产馆、经济作物馆、粮食馆、战胜灾害馆、棉花馆、棉织品馆、农业改进馆、日用品馆、手工业馆、重工业馆。
    在粮食、棉花、经济作物等馆中，人们首先可以看到华北与我国农业产品是多么富饶。国民党统治时期，我国一向依赖外粮进口；新中国成立仅仅两年，我国已经基本上可以自给了。华北农业生产中，涌现了历史上未曾有过的事迹，单位面积产量大为提高。如曲耀离一亩棉花产籽棉八百多斤，李顺达一亩玉蜀黍、郭云祥一亩谷子，各产九百多斤，马国荣一亩甘薯产一万斤。棉花与菸叶、麻、花生等经济作物的生产，已普遍恢复。棉花已超过抗日战争以前的产量。这些馆并告诉农民，应该大力增加单位面积产量；应该多种经济作物；应该注意选择优良品种，采用进步的科学耕作技术。
    在战胜灾害馆和农业改进馆中，人们可以看到华北农业的增产成绩，是在连年不断地与水、旱、虫、病等灾害进行严重斗争中获得的，是响应了毛主席“组织起来”的号召，并逐步采用科学技术而获得的。今后要进一步发展农业生产，还须继续发扬这些经验，并不断创造新的经验。
    农业生产资料馆，给人们指出农业机械化的前途。这里介绍了改进生产工具对发展农业生产的重要性，展览了各式改良农具及国产拖拉机，也介绍了各种有效的农药与器械，介绍了优良的肥料，说明了华北农村对上述物品需要的情况，要求城市工业大量供应上述生产资料。
    山干鲜货、药物、水产、畜产等馆，显示了我国土产的丰饶。华北的桃仁、栗子、红果，在品质与产量上，都占世界第一位。随着内销的发展和对苏联及人民民主国家贸易的发展，这些产品的销路已基本解决。有些产品已出现空前畅销情况。药材方面，过去一贯仰赖进口的红汞、盘尼西林等，现已都能自制，大部分已能自给。现在，畜产方面需要提倡优良品种，改进技术，增加生产，继续开拓国内外销路；水产方面，须注意解决加工与运销问题；山干鲜货等需增加产量，继续改善品质。 工业方面的日用品馆、棉织品馆、重工业馆，给人们指出华北的工业生产迅速发展的情况。例如玻璃，一九四七年至一九四八年从国外输入二十九万箱，去年则输出七万八千箱。天津的织染、针织、染整等业，生产和经营都有了改进。在这些展览馆中，对比展览了过去某些工商业者以粗制滥造的产品欺骗农民及现在改变的情况，给人以强烈印象。重工业馆重点展览了农产品加工机器与轻工业机器。该馆展出的农产品加工机器，都是最新式的，购造简单，使用方便，可在农村普遍推广。该馆展览的轻工业机器，可以改变中小城市部分手工业式的生产，提高产量与质量；还可以给工业原料进行加工；电器部分主要展览了适合中小城镇需要的电器，同时指出农村电气化机械化的远景。矿产部分，以煤铁为中心，介绍了华北丰富的煤铁蕴藏量，以及开采中的先进经验与技术。
    手工业馆的展览品，指出华北各地农民所用的工业品中，目前有百分之八十还是手工业品。某些地区的农民，并以手工业生产所得为主要收入。这种情况说明，手工业在相当长的时期内仍有发展前途。但目前急需组织起来，克服生产经营上的分散与落后性。
    工商改进馆中，系统地介绍了在新民主主义经济政策指导下，公私工商业大大发展与改进经营管理的情况和典型事迹。这里有华北各地工商业发展的情形，有各公私工厂建立各种先进管理制度的经验，有解放以来工人阶级在技术改进上的巨大成就。其中许多展览品，都是我国过去不能制造的。
    物资交流服务馆，是最大的一个展览馆，综合展览贸易、合作、交通、铁路、邮政、电信、税务、金融、民航等各方面在物资交流中所起的作用。通过一系列的图表、照片、模型、沙盘和幻灯，着重说明国营经济的领导作用，说明国营经济全力为物资交流服务的辉煌成绩。在这个展览馆中，又有许多反对美帝国主义经济封锁的图片，给私营工商业家指出“面向农村、加强内销”的方向和远景。
    区际馆展览了华北区需要的产品和可能供给各友邻区的产品，以及各大行政区的物资。在这个馆中，华北展览的主要产品有玻璃、碱、纱布、山货等；东北区的展览品以钢铁、各种重工业品、木材、豆饼等为重点；华东区以茶叶、丝绸等为重点；中南区以松香、苎麻、菸叶、桐油等为重点；西北区以羊皮、大黄等为重点。
    这个大会将要举行一个半月，于十一月下旬结束。    （林韦）
