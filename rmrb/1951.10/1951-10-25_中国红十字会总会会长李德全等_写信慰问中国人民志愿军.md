Expressing Respect to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for Their Great Victory on the Korean Front!
Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, and others Write to Express Their Condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, and all the staff of the Society, wrote a letter to express their condolences to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front. The letter stated: Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: It has been a year since you volunteered to go abroad to resist America and aid Korea, protect your homes and defend your country, and defend world peace. In this great year, your brilliant achievements have greatly encouraged the oppressed people of the world and strengthened the forces for defending world peace.
The letter reported on the work of the Red Cross Society of China, saying: In this great year, the Red Cross Society of New China, together with the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, jointly organized seven international medical and epidemic prevention teams to participate in the ranks of resisting America and aiding Korea. Some teams are on the front battlefield, and some are in the rear hospitals, closely cooperating with your battles. The Red Cross Society of China has also joined forces with the China Relief and Relief Association to launch a campaign to donate "ambulance aircraft." Hospitals and clinics of the Red Cross Society of China branches across the country have all formulated specific measures to give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers, ensuring that the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to their families is done well. In addition, the Red Cross Society of China also supported the Huai River project, organizing a medical and epidemic prevention team of more than 290 people to undertake the health and medical work of the Huai River migrant workers.
The letter said: Volunteer Army comrades, the entire people of the motherland are supporting you, everything is for you, because we must defeat the aggressors, we want peace! Dear comrades, pillars of the motherland, we would like to extend to you our highest respect and sincere condolences. (Xinhua News Agency)
