Introduction to the Egyptian People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle

Egypt is an ancient country in Africa, with an area of 386,000 square miles and a population of 19 million, 90 percent of whom are Muslims. It is located in the northeast corner of Africa, and the Suez Canal within its borders is a vital transportation route between Europe, Asia, and Africa. All routes between Europe and Asia must pass through here. Therefore, the Suez Canal is of great importance both militarily and economically.

The Egyptian people have long suffered under the slavery of British imperialism. In 1882, Britain sent troops to occupy Cairo, the capital of Egypt, and began to rule Egypt. In 1914, during the First World War, Britain took the opportunity to declare Egypt its protectorate. In 1922, under pressure from the Egyptian people's movement for independence, Britain was forced to recognize Egypt's "independence," but in reality, Egypt's military, political, and economic power remained in the hands of the British.

In 1936, Britain and Egypt signed a twenty-year alliance treaty. The treaty stipulated that Britain recognized Egypt as an "independent country," but Egypt should allow Britain to station 10,000 army soldiers and 400 air force pilots in the Suez Canal Zone; Britain could use the ports of Alexandria and Port Said as naval ports; and in the event of war, British troops could pass through Egypt. Southern Sudan was to be "jointly administered" by Britain and Egypt, according to an 1899 agreement.

Due to the exploitation and enslavement by British imperialism, the Egyptian people lived in extreme poverty. According to the Egyptian Minister of Health, every ordinary Egyptian suffers from at least three diseases. Egypt has one of the highest mortality rates in the world, with an average lifespan of 27 years. The number of unemployed people is constantly increasing.

However, the freedom-loving Egyptian people are unwilling to endure imperialist enslavement. Since the British invasion of Egypt in 1882, they have never stopped their struggle against imperialist enslavement. In 1906, 1924, 1930, and 1936, the Egyptian people held large-scale strikes against British imperialism.

After the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, the Egyptian people continuously launched movements demanding the abolition of the treaty and the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt. At the request of the Egyptian people, the Egyptian government held several negotiations with Britain. However, Britain repeatedly deceived and delayed, and the negotiations were fruitless. According to statistics, Britain has promised Egypt to withdraw British troops as many as 60 times, but the British troops in Egypt have not decreased but have increased. Prior to this incident, the number of British troops stationed in the Suez Canal Zone had increased to as many as 100,000.

With the rise of the Iranian people's anti-imperialist struggle demanding the nationalization of oil, the Egyptian people's movement demanding the abolition of the 1936 treaty and national independence also unfolded on a new and grand scale throughout the country. On August 26, thousands of workers, students, and citizens in Cairo, regardless of the authorities' suppression, first held demonstrations demanding the abolition of the 1936 treaty. The demonstrators shouted anti-imperialist slogans. On October 9, 10, and 16, people in various cities in Egypt held large-scale demonstrations. The demonstration held in Cairo on October 10 was attended by 100,000 people.

In the face of the rising anti-imperialist movement of the Egyptian people, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas submitted to the Egyptian Parliament on October 8 a decree on the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and the Anglo-Egyptian condominium agreement on Sudan of 1899. On October 15, the Egyptian Parliament passed this decree. On October 16, the delegation of workers in the Suez Canal Zone announced that all 40,000 Egyptian workers in the Canal Zone refused to work for the British. The Egyptian people's anti-British imperialist movement unfolded even more vigorously throughout the country.

The heroic struggle of the Egyptian people shocked the imperialist aggressors. They tried to maintain their rule over Egypt. After Egypt decided to abolish the 1936 treaty, the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey jointly made a proposal to the Egyptian government on October 13, threatening the Egyptian government to join the so-called "Middle East Joint Command" aggression group in the proposal. The four countries suggested that if Egypt agreed to join this "command," Britain would be willing to abolish the 1936 treaty, but Egypt should "provide troops to be placed under the Middle East Joint Command, and provide the command with necessary strategic defense equipment, such as military bases, air force bases, communications equipment, ports, etc." This imperialist proposal not only basically maintained Britain's occupying position in Egypt, but also further turned Egypt into an occupied country of the imperialist group headed by the United States. Therefore, this proposal aroused the indignation of the Egyptian people. The Egyptian government announced on the 15th that it refused to accept this proposal.

After the failure of the above-mentioned fraudulent plan, the British imperialists revealed their ferocity and used force. British troops poured into the Suez Canal Zone, and the 16th British Parachute Brigade, originally stationed in Cyprus and prepared to suppress the Iranian people, quickly arrived in Egypt. The number of British warships gathered in the Canal Zone increased to ten. On October 16, British troops even opened fire on Egyptian people participating in demonstrations and occupied Egyptian cities such as Port Said and Ismailia.

The United States, like in the Iranian issue, is actively interfering in the Egyptian issue, trying to expand its own influence in Egypt. According to Agence France-Presse: The goal that the United States is striving for is: "To prevent the military occupation of the Suez Canal Zone from having a British monopoly nature." The four-nation proposal that the United States pressured Egypt to accept was mainly for this purpose. After Egypt rejected the four-nation proposal, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson issued an absurd statement on the 17th, believing that "the actions taken by the Egyptian government regarding the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and the 1899 agreement on Sudan are inconsistent with the due respect for international obligations. The U.S. government believes that the actions of the Egyptian government are invalid." However, the imperialists' barbaric atrocities and intimidation have not deterred the Egyptian people. At present, the Egyptian people's struggle for national independence and the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty is developing vigorously. In this struggle, the Egyptian people are not isolated. The people of the Middle East and peace-loving people all over the world sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. As long as the Egyptian people unite and fight resolutely, and are vigilant against all the conspiracies of imperialism, then the final victory will surely belong to the Egyptian people.

    埃及人民反帝斗争介绍
    埃及是非洲的一个古国，面积有三十八万六千平方英里，人口一千九百万，其中百分之九十信奉回教。它位于非洲的东北角，境内的苏彝士运河，是欧、亚、非三洲的交通要道。欧洲和亚洲之间的一切航路必须经过这里。因此，苏彝士运河在军事上和经济上都处于极重要的地位。
    埃及人民很久以来就受着英帝国主义的奴役。一八八二年，英国派兵占领埃及首都开罗，开始统治埃及。一九一四年第一次世界大战时，英国乘机宣布埃及为它的保护国。一九二二年，英国慑于埃及人民要求独立的运动，被迫承认埃及“独立”，但是实际上，埃及的军事、政治和经济大权，仍掌握在英国人手里。
    一九三六年，英国和埃及签订了一项二十年同盟条约。条约规定：英国承认埃及是“独立国”，但是埃及应允许英国在苏彝士运河区驻陆军一万人，空军驾驶员四百人；英国可以以亚历山大港和塞得港为军港；在战争发生时，英军可以通过埃及。埃及南部的苏丹，按照一八九九年的协定，由英埃两国“共管”。
    由于英帝国主义的剥削和奴役，埃及人民过着极端贫困的生活。据埃及卫生部长估计，每一个普通的埃及人至少患着三种病。埃及是世界人口死亡率最高的国家之一，平均寿命是二十七岁。失业的人数不断增加。
    但是，爱好自由的埃及人民决不愿忍受帝国主义的奴役。他们自一八八二年英国侵入埃及以后，一直没有停止过反对帝国主义奴役的斗争。一九○六年、一九二四年、一九三○年和一九三六年，埃及人民都举行过大规模的反对英帝国主义的罢工。
    一九三六年英埃条约签订后，埃及人民即不断地展开要求废除该项条约的运动，要求英军撤出埃及。埃及政府在埃及人民的要求下，曾和英国进行过多次谈判。但是英国一再欺骗拖延，谈判毫无结果。据统计，英国答应埃及撤退英军已有六十次之多，但是埃及的英军不但不见减少，反而日渐增加。在这次事件以前，驻在苏彝士运河区的英军，已增至十万人之多。
    随着伊朗人民反对帝国主义、要求石油国有化斗争的高涨，埃及人民要求废除一九三六年条约、要求民族独立的运动，也以新的巨大的规模在全国开展起来。八月二十六日，开罗的工人、学生和市民数千人不顾当局的镇压，首先举行示威游行，要求废除一九三六年的条约。示威者高呼反对帝国主义的口号。十月九日、十日和十六日埃及各城市的人民都举行了大规模示威游行。十月十日在开罗举行的示威游行，有十万人参加。
    在埃及全国人民反对帝国主义运动高涨的情况下，埃及首相纳哈斯于十月八日向埃及议会提出了关于废除一九三六年英埃条约及一八九九年英埃共管苏丹协定的法令，十五日，埃及议会通过了这一法令。十六日，苏彝士运河区工人代表团就宣布运河区的四万埃及工人全体拒绝替英国人工作。火车司机也拒绝驾驶装运英军的火车。埃及人民反对英帝国主义的运动就更加如火如荼地在全国展开。
    埃及人民的英勇斗争，震惊了帝国主义侵略者。他们力图保持它们对埃及的统治。在埃及决定废除一九三六年条约之后，美、英、法、土四国就在十月十三日联合向埃及政府提出建议，要胁埃及政府参加建议中的所谓“中东联合司令部”侵略集团。四国建议提出，如果埃及同意参加这个“司令部”，英国就愿意废除一九三六年的条约，但是埃及应该“提供交由中东联合司令部支配的军队，以及为司令部提供必要的战略防御设备，诸如军事基地、空军基地、通讯设备、港口等”。帝国主义者的这一建议，不但基本上保持了英国在埃及的占领地位，而且使埃及进一步变成以美国为首的帝国主义集团的占领国。因此，这一建议激起了埃及全国人民的愤慨。埃及政府在十五日宣布拒绝接受这一建议。
    上述欺诈计划失败后，英帝国主义者凶相毕露，使用了武力。英国军队源源开往苏彝士运河区，驻在塞浦路斯原来准备用来镇压伊朗人民的英国伞兵第十六旅很快开到了埃及。结集在运河区的英国军舰，增加到十艘。十月十六日，英军竟开枪射击参加示威游行的埃及人民，并侵占了塞得港、伊士美利亚等埃及城市。
    美国在埃及问题上，正如在伊朗问题上一样，正积极进行干涉，力图扩大它自己在埃及的势力。据法新社消息：美国争取的目标是：“不使苏彝士运河地带的军事占领，带有英国独占的性质。”美国压迫埃及接受的四国建议，主要的目的也就在此。在埃及拒绝四国建议之后，美国国务卿艾奇逊在十七日发表了荒谬的声明，认为“埃及政府对于一九三六年英埃条约和一八九九年关于苏丹的协定所采取的行动，和对国际义务的应有的尊重是不相符合的。美国政府认为埃及政府的行动没有效力”。然而，帝国主义者的野蛮暴行与恫吓，并没有吓倒埃及人民。目前，埃及全国人民要求民族独立与废除英埃条约的斗争，正在蓬勃地发展着。在这一斗争中，埃及人民不是孤立的。中东各国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人们都同情和支持埃及人民的正义斗争。埃及人民只要团结一致，坚决进行斗争，警惕帝国主义的一切阴谋，那么，最后胜利一定是属于埃及人民的。（新华社）
