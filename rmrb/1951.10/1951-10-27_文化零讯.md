Five maternal and child health hospitals and 45 maternal and child health stations have been established in various places.

	▲Nine Tibetan People's Schools, equivalent to primary schools, have been newly established in the Qamdo area of ​​Xikang. Schools have also been established for the first time in areas where there were no schools in the past. Because the lives of the Tibetan people have improved since liberation, more and more children are being sent to school. In the newly established Tibetan schools in Re’uqi, Shodoi, Bamda, and Lhorong Dzong, there were 226 students in the first phase. The number of students in the Qamdo Tibetan Cadre Training Class is also constantly increasing. As of August this year, 111 students have graduated.
