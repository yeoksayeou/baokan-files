    To the Editor:

    The Cooperative Union of Yizheng County, Northern Jiangsu, conducted a political and current affairs test for the directors and accountants of various grassroots cooperatives in mid-September to understand the political learning situation of cadres. This test revealed a serious tendency among these staff members to neglect politics.

    Out of the fourteen people who took the test, nine failed. More seriously, some cadres had fundamental errors in their understanding of the questions. For example, Shen Changgan, the director of the Xupu Cooperative, answered that our National Day was on "October 10th," answered that the targets of the New Democratic Revolution were the "national bourgeoisie," and answered that the illegal separate peace conference with Japan convened by American imperialism in San Francisco was the "World Peace Conference." Some people also did not know basic political common sense. For example, He Zhengshu, the chief accountant of the Chengnan Chengxiang Cooperative, answered that the three enemies of the New Democratic Revolution were "Truman, Chiang Kai-shek, and England," and the four friends were "Stalin, Nam Il, Poland, and Czechoslovakia."

    Through this fact, the leading cadres of the Yizheng County Cooperative have deeply realized that this is the result of neglecting the political education of cadres. They have now formulated methods for improvement. This matter should be taken as a warning. As a cadre, if one does not even know the most basic political common sense, how can one educate the masses?

### 苏北仪征县基层合作社干部有严重忽视政治倾向

    苏北仪征县基层合作社干部有严重忽视政治倾向编辑同志：
    苏北仪征县合作社联合社，为了解干部政治学习情况，曾在九月中旬对各基层社主任及会计人员举行一次政治时事测验。通过这次测验，暴露了这些工作人员严重忽视政治的倾向。
    参加测验的十四个人，就有九个不及格。更严重的是有些干部对问题的认识有原则性的错误，如胥浦合作社理事主任沈长干，把我们的国庆日答在“十月十日”，把新民主主义革命对象答成“民族资产阶级”，把美帝国主义在旧金山召开的非法的对日单独媾和的会议，答成“全世界和平会”。又有一些人，对基本的政治常识也不知道，如城内城厢合作社总会计何正书把新民主主义革命的三个敌人答成“杜鲁门、蒋介石、英国”，四个朋友答成“斯大林、南日、波兰、捷克”。
    仪征县合作社领导干部通过这一事实，已经深切地认识到这是放松干部政治教育的结果；现在他们已订出改进的办法。这件事是值得引起警惕的；作为一个干部，如连起码的政治常识也不知道，如何能教育群众呢？
