Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 18th. Medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet are actively treating Tibetan people, and are extremely popular among the Tibetans. According to incomplete statistics from the health department of the entering Tibet troops, more than 10,000 Tibetans and lamas have been treated, of which lamas account for 15%. In the clinics of the troops stationed in Qamdo, Lhorong Dzong, and Nyingchi and other places, Tibetan people and lamas seeking medical treatment are often crowded. Most of the treated patients have recovered. The six-year eye disease of Living Buddha Lodro Khyenrab of Chaya and the more than 20-year quadriplegia of Living Buddha Shiba Nila have both recovered after treatment. The medical staff of a certain unit stationed in Qamdo also assisted the Qamdo Liberation Committee in carrying out smallpox prevention work. On the first day of work alone, they vaccinated 180 Tibetan children with cowpox. In order to take care of Tibetans from distant places, many troop clinics have specially added night shifts and sent medical personnel to make house calls. Medical personnel from the troops in the clinics in Batang and Nyingchi have made house calls for Tibetans in an area of ​​thousands of miles from east to west and hundreds of miles from north to south. According to the statistics of the Batang clinic in four months, the number of people who received treatment reached 1,200.

    The medical personnel of the entering Tibet troops patiently serve the Tibetan people, and have established a high prestige among the Tibetans. In the past, Tibetans sought gods when they got sick, but now they tell each other: "Go to the People's Liberation Army for treatment when you are sick." In the first month of the establishment of the Qamdo clinic, only 43 Tibetans came to see the doctor. In January and February this year, the number has increased to 294. Many Tibetans come from hundreds of miles away to seek medical treatment, or lead livestock to welcome the PLA medical personnel to treat illnesses.

    入藏部队的医务人员积极为藏族人民治病 【新华社重庆十八日电】人民解放军入藏部队的医务人员积极为藏族人民治病，极受藏民欢迎。据入藏部队卫生部门不完全的统计，已有一万多个藏民和喇嘛得到治疗，其中喇嘛即占百分之十五。在昌都、洛隆宗和宁静等地部队的门诊所内，经常挤满了要求治病的藏民和喇嘛。经过治疗的病人，已大部痊愈。察雅罗登协绕活佛为时已六年的眼疾和什巴尼拉活佛已二十多年的四肢瘫痪病，经过治疗后都恢复了健康。驻昌都某部的医务人员，还协助昌都解放委员会进行预防天花的工作，仅在开始工作的第一天，就为一百八十名藏族儿童接种了牛痘。为照顾远地藏民，部队的许多门诊所还特地增加夜班，并派医务人员出诊。巴塘和宁静两地诊疗所的部队医务人员，曾在东西千里、南北百余里的地区为藏民出诊。据巴塘诊疗所四个月的出诊统计，受诊人数即达一千二百人。
    入藏部队医务人员耐心为藏民服务，已在藏民中树立了很高的威信。过去藏民遇病就求神，现在则互相传告：“有病找解放军去治。”昌都门诊所成立的第一个月，只有四十三个藏民前来看病，今年一、二月份已增加到二百九十四名。许多藏民从数百里外赶来治病，或牵着牲口来迎接解放军医务人员去治病。
