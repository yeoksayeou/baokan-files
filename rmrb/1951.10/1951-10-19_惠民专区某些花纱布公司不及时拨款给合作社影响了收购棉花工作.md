To the Editor:

In the current cotton purchasing and storage work, cotton yarn and cloth companies should maintain close contact with cooperatives, deeply understand the cotton production and storage situation, and allocate funds to cooperatives in a timely and sufficient manner. This is an important link to ensure the smooth progress of the work. In some areas of Huimin Special District, Shandong Province, cotton yarn and cloth companies have failed to allocate funds to cooperatives in a timely and sufficient manner, resulting in adverse consequences. For example, the Putai Shikou Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company office is responsible for allocating funds to cooperatives in the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of Kenli County, but the district cooperatives can only receive enough funds for two or three days at a time. The fifth district is far from the office, and it takes two days to travel back and forth. Due to insufficient funds, the purchase of cotton is also insufficient. Especially in the few days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the masses sold large quantities of cotton to prepare for the festival, but the cooperatives had no money to buy it. On September 17th, more than 13,000 catties of cotton were available on the market in the district. The district cooperative originally requested 50 million yuan from the office, but only received 15 million yuan, which was only enough to buy more than 6,000 catties of cotton. Another example is that the sixth and seventh district cooperatives of Zanhua County also cannot fully purchase cotton due to insufficient funds, and private merchants take the opportunity to lower market prices for purchase. The listed price is 2,400 yuan, but private merchants lowered it to 2,000 yuan and 1,800 yuan, which caused great losses to cotton farmers. The above facts show that the fund allocation authorities must deeply understand the cotton output and purchase situation in the location of the cotton purchasing organization and allocate funds in a timely and sufficient manner in order to enable the cooperatives to collect more cotton for the country and prevent illegal private merchants from exploiting loopholes. Now cotton farmers in various places are enthusiastically selling cotton. I suggest that cotton yarn and cloth companies and cooperatives in cotton producing areas pay attention to this issue.

### 惠民专区某些花纱布公司不及时拨款给合作社影响了收购棉花工作

    惠民专区某些花纱布公司不及时拨款给合作社影响了收购棉花工作编辑同志：
    在目前购棉储棉工作中，花纱布公司应与合作社密切联系，深入了解棉花生产及收储情况，并及时而充分地拨款给合作社。这是使工作顺利进行的重要环节之一。山东惠民专区某些地区的花纱布公司，未能及时充分拨款给合作社，就造成不良后果。如蒲台史口花纱布公司办事处，负责拨款给垦利县五、六、七区的合作社，但区合作社每次总只能拿到只够两三天用的款。五区离办事处较远，来回就要两天，由于款不足，收购棉花也不足，特别在中秋节前几天，群众大量售棉准备过节，合作社却无钱收买。九月十七日该区上市棉花一万三千多斤，区合作社原来向办事处提款五千万元，结果只拿到一千五百万元，只买得六千多斤花。又如沾化县六、七区合作社也因款子不够，不能充分收购棉花，私商就趁机压低市价收买，牌价是两千四百元，私商压低至二千元与一千八百元，棉农吃亏很大。以上事实说明，拨款机关必须深入了解收花机关所在地棉花产量及收买情况，及时而充分地拨款，才能使合作社给国家收到更多的棉花，才能杜绝不法私商的钻空子。现在各地棉农正踊跃售棉，我建议产棉区各地花纱布公司及合作社注意这个问题。
