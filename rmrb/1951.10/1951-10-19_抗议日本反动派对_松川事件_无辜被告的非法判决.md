    Protest the Illegal Verdict of the Japanese Reactionaries Against Innocent Defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident"
    Editor:
    We have written a letter to comrades Saito Sen and others, the innocent defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident," expressing our support for their just struggle. We hope to have it published. The original letter is as follows:

    To Comrades Saito Sen and others:
    After reading the appeal you wrote in prison, published in the People's Daily, we are even more resentful of American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, and unanimously express our determination to support your just struggle.

    American imperialism and its Japanese running dogs deliberately framed Japanese patriotic people who oppose their policies of aggression, and planned the "Matsukawa Incident" to cruelly persecute innocent you. But you have an iron will and an indomitable fighting spirit. Not only did you not bow your heads to the verdict of the traitorous running dogs, but it also deepened your hatred for American imperialism and the Yoshida government, and strengthened your courage to fight.

    Your struggle to win peace and independence and oppose the militarization of Japan has received the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Your just calls will resound throughout Asia and the world. We firmly protest the shameless verdict of the Japanese reactionaries against you and demand your immediate and unconditional release.

    In brotherly salute!

    抗议日本反动派对“松川事件”无辜被告的非法判决编辑同志：
    我们写了一封给日本“松川事件”无辜被告斋藤千等同志的信，表示对他们正义斗争的支援，希望能把它发表。原信如下：斋藤千等同志：
    当我们读了登载在人民日报上的你们在狱中所写的呼吁书后，我们更加愤恨美帝国主义与日本反动派，并且一致表示决心支持你们的正义斗争。
    美帝国主义及其日本的走狗，蓄意陷害反对他们侵略政策的日本爱国志士，有计划地制造“松川事件”，对无辜的你们加以凶残的迫害。但你们有着钢铁般的意志，不屈不挠的斗争精神，不但没有向卖国走狗们的判决低头，而且更加深了你们对美帝国主义及吉田政府的痛恨，加强了斗争的勇气。
    你们为争取和平与独立、反对使日本军事基地化的斗争，受到了我们中国人民与全世界人民的同情和支持。你们的正义呼声将响遍全亚洲、全世界。我们坚决抗议日本反动派对你们的无耻判决，并要求立即无条件释放你们。致
    兄弟的敬礼！中华人民共和国中央人民政府水利部华北水利工程局九松山水文站
