    Resolutely Implement Security Checks
    The "Instructions on Autumn Security Checks" issued by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry is an effective way to improve safety and health in factories and mines, and to implement the state's labor protection policies. Leading organs of all levels of industrial and mining enterprises should conscientiously implement these instructions.

    Why is it necessary to conduct security checks? This is because, among many leading cadres and workers in factories and mines, there are still some ideas that neglect security work. If these erroneous ideas cannot be eradicated, it will be impossible to improve safety and health work. Among the administrative leaders of some state-owned enterprises, the main erroneous idea is to place safety in opposition to production. They believe that safety and production are mutually exclusive; therefore, they only care about production and ignore safety. They do not understand that if the safety of employees cannot be guaranteed, production work cannot be carried out smoothly. Among some workers, the main erroneous idea is the paralyzing thought of "resigning to fate." Workers are inherently most concerned about safety work, but because they have worked for a long time in imperialist, bureaucratic capitalist, and private enterprises, they have not been able to obtain any safety and health guarantees, and they have also developed an abnormal mentality of neglecting safety and health. As long as we deeply publicize the state's labor protection laws and regulations to them, and effectively improve safety and health work, this can be changed.

    So, how to carry out security checks? The most important thing is to mobilize workers to conduct inspections under leadership. In this way, not only can many problems related to safety and health work that leaders did not know in the past be discovered, and workers can be mobilized to come up with solutions to these problems; but also the problems discovered in the inspection can be used to specifically educate workers and change their mentality of neglecting safety and health. Of course, some safety and health problems identified during the checks require large investments from the state to solve, and it is impossible to completely solve them all at once. However, many problems can be solved by mobilizing the masses of workers to take action, spending very little money, or even without spending any money. This year, in the security check campaign in state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, more than 139,000 problems were discovered, nearly half of which were solved by mobilizing the masses, spending very little money, or even without spending any money. This is a good lesson for those who, when it comes to safety and health work, loudly complain that they have no money to do it.

### 坚决实行保安大检查

    坚决实行保安大检查
    中央人民政府重工业部发布的秋季保安大检查的指示，是改进厂矿安全卫生工作，贯彻国家保护劳动政策的有效办法。各级工矿领导机关，应该认真执行这个指示。
    为什么必须进行保安大检查呢？这是因为，在许多厂矿领导干部和工人群众中，都还存在着若干忽视保安工作的思想，这些错误思想如果不能根除，就无法改进安全卫生工作。在某些国营企业的行政领导干部中，最主要的错误思想是把安全与生产对立起来，他们认为，安全与生产不可得兼，因此，他们只顾生产，不顾安全；他们不了解，如果不能保证职工的安全，就不能顺利进行生产工作。在部分工人群众中，主要的错误思想是“听天由命”的麻痹思想。工人本来是最关心安全工作的，但因过去长期在帝国主义、官僚资本及私营企业中工作，丝毫得不到安全卫生的保障，也养成了一种忽视安全卫生的变态心理。只要向他们深入宣传国家保护劳动的法令，切实改进安全卫生工作，这是可以改变的。
    那么，怎样进行保安大检查呢？最主要的是有领导地发动工人动手检查。这样，不但可以发现许多过去领导者所不知道的关于安全卫生工作的问题，并发动工人想出解决这些问题的办法；而且可以用检查中发现的问题，具体地教育工人，改变工人忽视安全卫生的心理。当然，检查出来的安全卫生问题，有的需要国家大量投资才能解决，一时不可能完全办到，但大量的问题，是可以发动工人群众大家动手，花很少的钱，甚至不花钱就可以解决的。今年东北国营企业在保安大检查运动中，发现了十三万九千多个问题，其中将近一半问题是发动了群众，花了很少的钱，甚至没有花钱就解决了的。这对于那些一提安全卫生工作，就大嚷没钱举办的人，是一个很好的教育。
