Dear Comrades:

    Allow me, on behalf of the Soviet social organizations and the working people of the Soviet Union, to extend fraternal greetings to you and to congratulate you on the second anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

    The fraternal Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China last year has made Sino-Soviet friendship a great and powerful force in consolidating world peace. There has never been such a force in human history. This treaty has great international significance. It marks a tremendous increase in the strength and unity of the camp of peace and democracy.

    This historic document will permanently consolidate the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Every line of this treaty is filled with the spirit of sincere mutual respect for national independence and interests of the two great friendly peoples.

    The Soviet people are watching the achievements of the young People's Republic of China with deep concern and sympathy. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the glorious leader Mao Zedong, this young republic has achieved victories in national construction, national economy, and cultural undertakings, and is moving forward with confidence.

    The achievements of the Chinese people clearly mark the profound vitality of the Chinese people's democratic system, proving that this system has indisputable superiority over the old anti-people system. The old anti-people system shackled the strength of the working masses, stifled the talents of the people, and plunged hundreds of millions of people into poverty and ignorance.

    The people's democratic system has mobilized the broadest masses of working people to build a new life and participate in national governance. In the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, tremendous events have occurred domestically that were impossible in the past hundreds, or even thousands, of years.

    The close friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies have created conditions for the rapid development of China's economy and strengthened the forces of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    Comrades, the Soviet people have victoriously completed the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan and have achieved new and significant developments in all sectors of the socialist economy and culture.

    The industrial product production in 1950 increased by 73 percent compared to 1940. The Five-Year Plan was completed in the industrial field in four years and three months.

    The total grain harvest in 1950 exceeded 345 million poods compared to the level of 1940. The task of expanding the sown area was overfulfilled by 20 percent. The yield of grain crops has been greatly improved.

    And the decisions to build the Volga River, Dnieper River, and Turkmen hydropower stations, which were adopted based on Comrade Stalin's initiative, are being implemented. Canals and irrigation systems that are unprecedented in the world's architectural engineering technology are being constructed.

    Honest people in all countries of the world regard these decisions of the Soviet government as a new manifestation of the peaceful policy of our great motherland.

    The material life of the Soviet people is constantly improving. Due to the development of the national economy and repeated reductions in the prices of products and consumer goods, the total income of workers, staff, and farmers in 1950 increased by 64 percent compared to 1940.

    The Soviet government also pays great attention to housing construction. During the Five-Year Plan, a total of more than 100 million square meters of housing was built and repaired. In addition, 2.7 million houses were repaired and built in rural areas.

    The Soviet people are consolidating the cause of peace with Stakhanovite labor. This labor is encouraged by the creative spirit of prosperity and further improving the living standards of all working people.

    The Soviet people look to the future with confidence. They live in a country where socialism has already triumphed, and in this country, the material foundation is being successfully laid for the realization of a communist society—the bright ideal of mankind.

    Comrades, after the great October Socialist Revolution, the victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are the greatest events in history.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out with genius foresight that after the October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese revolution would continue to greatly widen the breach in the imperialist front in the East. Comrade Stalin predicted twenty-five years ago: "The strength of the Chinese revolutionary movement is immeasurable. These forces have not yet been properly expressed. They will be expressed in the future. The rulers of the East and the West do not see these forces, do not estimate these forces to the extent they should, and they will suffer because of it." This prophecy has come true today.

    Inspired by the all-conquering Marxist-Leninist ideology, the great Chinese people have become the masters of their own country and the builders of their own country.

    The historic victory of the Chinese people's revolution is a powerful blow to the entire system of world imperialism and to all imperialist aggression plans.

    Now, when the Anglo-American imperialist bloc has moved from the policy of preparing for a new world war to direct acts of aggression, the friendship and alliance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are of paramount importance in defending the cause of peace.

    American interventionists have been waging a war of aggression against the heroic Korean people for the second year. They barbarously destroyed cities and inhumanely burned and killed Korean residents. The Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers are bravely defending freedom and independence side by side. The whole world knows that the armistice talks, which began under the pressure of public opinion, are being deliberately delayed by the American imperialists, who are using shameless instigation to sabotage the talks.

    Driven mad by the failure of their aggressive policy in China, the American warmongers are unwilling to recognize the historically significant victory of the Chinese revolution. They are still plotting plans to enslave China and suppress the national liberation movement in Asia.

    America's aggression in Korea, its occupation of Taiwan, the repeated violations of the People's Republic of China's borders by American aircraft, the "United Nations'" discrimination against the new democratic China, and the support for the shameless Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang—all of this proves that American imperialism has not given up its delusions of enslaving China and other countries in the East.

    The aggression and plunder of the American imperialists have aroused the hatred of the people of Asia and the world for the plunderers. After the great historical victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, a new life began in the history of the people of Asia and the world.

    The American imperialists are rearming West Germany and restoring Japanese militarism. They signed a separate peace treaty with Japan without the participation of China, India, and Burma, with the aim of building a new springboard for launching a war against peace-loving people. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union is deeply concerned about defending the cause of peace and opposes illegal treaties.

    Hundreds of millions of Chinese people stand unshakably at their posts in defending the freedom and independence of their republic.

    The signatures of hundreds of millions of the great Chinese people on the World Peace Council's appeal for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact demonstrate the Chinese people's firm will for peace.

    The fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, who account for one-third of the world's population, is a guarantee that the imperialists' aggressive plans in the Far East are bound to fail. This friendship is an invincible force.

    On the occasion of celebrating the sixth anniversary of the victory over Japanese imperialists, Comrade Stalin pointed out in his congratulatory telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong: There is no doubt that the indestructible friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is now and will be in the future for the cause of ensuring peace in the Far East and opposing all aggressors and warmongers.

    For the victory of the great cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, let the fraternal friendship between our two peoples be stronger and more consolidated!

    Comrades! On the occasion of the second anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I would like to wish you new achievements in the construction of the great People's Democratic Republic, in the struggle for the happiness and prosperity of the fraternal Chinese people.

    Long live the great Chinese people and the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China!

    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the long-tested leader of the Chinese people!

    Long live Comrade Stalin, the best friend of the Chinese people and the great leader of the working people of the world!

    在中苏友好协会全国代表会议上
    索洛维耶夫代表苏联人民致贺亲爱的同志们：
    让我代表苏联各社会团体、代表苏联的劳动人民向你们致以兄弟的敬礼，并当此中苏友好协会成立两周年之际向你们表示祝贺。
    在去年，在苏联与中华人民共和国之间所签定的兄弟般的友好同盟互助条约使苏中友谊成为在巩固世界和平的事业上的伟大雄壮的力量。在人类历史上没有过这样的力量。这个条约有着巨大的国际意义。它标志着和平民主阵营的力量底巨大增强和团结。
    这一历史性的文件将永久巩固苏中人民的友谊。这个条约的每一行字都充满了两国伟大友好人民的真诚的互相尊重民族独立与利益的精神。
    苏联人民以深切的关怀与同情，注视着年轻的中华人民共和国的各种成就。这个年轻共和国在共产党和光荣的领袖毛泽东领导下在国家建设、国民经济、文化事业各方面取得了胜利，它满怀信心地向前迈进。
    中国人民的成就，显明地标志出中国人民民主制度的深刻的生命力，证明了，这个制度比起旧的反人民的制度，是具有不可争辩的优越性。旧的反人民的制度束缚了劳动群众的力量、窒息了人民的天才，使几万万人们陷于贫困与愚昧。
    人民民主制度发动了最广大的劳动群众来建设新的生活，参加国家管理。中华人民共和国成立两年来，在国内发生了在过去几百年，甚至几千年所不能有的巨大事变。
    中华人民共和国同苏联及人民民主国家之间的亲密友谊与合作，为中国经济的迅速发展创造了条件，加强了和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量。
    同志们：苏联人民胜利地完成了战后斯大林五年计划，并且在社会主义的经济、文化各部门中都取得了新的巨大发展。
    一九五○年的工业产品生产量比一九四○年增加了百分之七十三。工业方面是在四年零三个月的期间中完成了五年计划。
    一九五○年粮食总收获量同一九四○年的水平比较，超过了三亿四千五百万普特。扩大播种面积的任务超过完成了百分之二十。粮食作物的收获量大大的提高了。
    并且在实现着，根据斯大林同志的倡议而通过的建设伏尔加河、德尼泊尔河及土库曼水电站的决定。建筑着，在世界建筑工程技术上空前巨大的运河和灌溉系统。
    世界各国的正直人们都把苏联政府的这些决定，看成是我们伟大祖国的和平政策的新的表现。
    苏联人民的物质生活不断的提高。由于国民经济的发展，和产品及消费品价格的一再降低，在一九五○年工人，职员和农民的收入总额比一九四○年增加了百分之六十四。
    苏联政府对于住宅建设也与以极大的注意。在五年计划期间，建成和修复的住宅总面积达一亿平方公尺以上。此外，在农村修复和建成的住宅有二百七十万所。
    苏联人民以斯达哈诺夫式的劳动巩固着和平事业。为了繁荣和更加提高全体劳动人民生活水平的创造精神，鼓励着这种劳动。
    苏维埃人们满怀信心地注视着未来。他们生活在社会主义已经胜利的国家里，在这个国家里正在为实现共产主义社会——人类的光明理想——顺利地建立着物质的基础。
    同志们：在伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的建立，是历史上最伟大的事件。
    斯大林同志曾以天才的预见指出：在十月社会主义革命之后，中国革命将要在东方继续大大的加大帝国主义阵线的缺口。斯大林同志在二十五年前曾预言道：“中国革命运动底力量是不可计量的。这些力量还没有恰当地表现出来。它们将来还会表现出来。东方和西方的统治者看不到这些力量，不以应有的程度估计到这些力量，他们将因此而吃苦头。”这个预言今天实现了。
    为战胜一切的马列主义思想所鼓舞的伟大的中国人民，已经成为自己国家的主人，成为自己国家的建设者。
    中国人民革命的历史性的胜利，是对世界帝国主义整个系统、对帝国主义的一切侵略计划的一个强有力的打击。
    现在，当着英美帝国主义集团已经由准备新的世界战争的政策、进而走向直接侵略的行动的时候，苏联和中华人民共和国的友好和同盟，在保卫和平事业上有着极重大的意义。
    美国干涉者进行反对英勇朝鲜人民的侵略战争，已经是第二年了。他们野蛮地破坏了城市，惨无人道地烧杀朝鲜居民。朝鲜人民和中国志愿军并肩英勇地保卫着自由和独立。全世界都知道，在社会舆论压力之下而开始的停战谈判，被美国帝国主义者们故意地拖延着，他们使用无耻的煽动挑拨来破坏谈判。
    由于自己在中国的侵略政策的失败而疯狂的美国战争贩子们，不甘心于承认具有历史意义的中国革命胜利的事实。仍在策拟奴役中国和镇压亚洲民族解放运动的计划。
    美国在朝鲜的侵略，对台湾的侵占，美国飞机屡次侵犯中华人民共和国国境，“联合国”对新的民主中国的歧视，支持无耻的蒋介石匪帮——所有这一切，都证明美帝国主义并没有放弃他的奴役中国和东方其他国家的妄想。
    美帝国主义者的侵略和掠夺行动，激起了全亚洲和全世界人民对掠夺者的憎恨。在中国人民伟大的历史性的胜利和中华人民共和国建立之后，在全亚洲和全世界人民的历史上开始了新的生活。
    美帝国主义者们在重新武装着西德，恢复着日本军国主义。他们签订了没有中国、印度和缅甸参加的单独对日和约，其目的就是为发动反对爱好和平的人民的战争，来建立新的跳板。大家都知道，苏联是深切地关怀着保卫和平的事业，反对非法条约。
    几万万的中国人民毫不动摇地站在保卫自己共和国的自由和独立的岗位上。
    在世界和平理事会关于缔结五大国和平公约的呼吁书上的，几万万的伟大的中国人民的签名，证明了中国人民对和平的坚决意志。
    占全世界人口三分之一的苏联和中华人民共和国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊，就是促使帝国主义者在远东的侵略计划必定失败的一个保证。这种友谊是不可战胜的力量。
    在庆祝战胜日本帝国主义者六周年之际，在斯大林同志致毛泽东同志的贺电中指出：无庸置疑，苏联和中华人民共和国的不可摧毁的友谊，在现在和将来都是为着保证远东和平及反对一切侵略者及战争贩子的事业。
    为了争取和平、民主及社会主义伟大事业的胜利，让我们两国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊更为强大，更为巩固吧！
    同志们！当此，中苏友好协会成立二周年之际，我谨预祝诸位在伟大的人民民主共和国的建设事业中，在为了争取兄弟的中国人民的幸福和繁荣的斗争中，获得新的成就。
    伟大的中国人民和中华人民共和国万岁！
    苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民之间的永久的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    久经考验的中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国人民的最好的朋友，全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志万岁！
