Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. The people's observation delegations from various countries who attended our National Day celebrations visited rural areas in the suburbs of Shanghai on the 14th and attended a meeting in Sitang Township, Jiangwan District, where liberated peasants celebrated the return of land. When land certificates were issued and landlord contracts were burned at the meeting, the representatives from various countries cheered and applauded, warmly celebrating the great victory of the Chinese peasants' liberation. Gusta Fučíková, head of the Czechoslovak People's Observation Delegation, said: "This is a most historic moment, and I am excited and cheering for the liberation of the Chinese peasants!" The representatives spoke cordially with the peasants, and representatives from various countries presented the badges they had brought from afar to the peasants as souvenirs. The Hungarian observation delegation presented a woven Hungarian national emblem to the Farmers' Association of Sitang Township.
    On the 15th, the representatives visited various people's organizations in East China and Shanghai, and collectively visited factories producing machines and light bulbs in Shanghai. During their visits, the representatives expressed their admiration for the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea. When Korean writer Li Taijun visited the East China General Branch and Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for their assistance to Korea. When visiting the factories, the representatives carefully recorded the Chinese workers' increased production and donations, the signing of patriotic pacts, the unity and mutual assistance in their work, and the active proposal of rationalization suggestions, preparing to take them back and tell the people of their own countries. When visiting a certain machine factory, the famous Czechoslovak shock worker Svoboda, who won the Republic Medal, performed high-speed cutting on the spot. The workers of the factory watched his performance intently, and everyone said that they would learn his excellent working methods.
