Major cotton textile factories across the country have begun to focus on promoting the Hao Jianxiu-style fine yarn work method.

In Qingdao, where the Hao Jianxiu work method was first promoted, the vast majority of fine yarn workers have basically learned this advanced work method. The amount of lap waste from the leather rollers in each factory has generally been reduced by 30% to 65%. However, due to insufficient patriotic propaganda and education, a small number of workers with poor work attitudes have engaged in the phenomenon of hiding white cotton waste. To overcome this deviation, factories in Qingdao have begun a supplementary patriotic education campaign.

The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method in Shanghai's cotton textile factories is also actively underway. In early September, after the 23 representatives from the city who attended the Qingdao fine yarn worker representative meeting returned to Shanghai, the East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union helped them form a promotion team to conduct a pilot project with a focus on promotion in the State-owned Third Cotton Textile Factory. Because the promotion emphasized the political significance of studying the Hao Jianxiu work method, overcame the conservative and complacent thinking of a small number of workers, and reformed certain tools and old systems, the promotion work was very smooth. More than 30 female fine yarn workers in the factory have learned the Hao Jianxiu work method. When they first started learning, some workers felt that it was too stressful to patrol the workshop all day and use their brains; later, they felt relaxed and organized, unlike the intermittent tension of the past. In the past, female worker Yi Shijuan was active in her work, and the amount of lap waste from her leather rollers was once as low as six taels, but her work was irregular, and she would pick up any broken ends she saw, running more than 5,200 steps in two hours. After learning the Hao Jianxiu work method, she only had to run more than 2,380 steps. Many female workers said, "The Hao Jianxiu work method is really a good method for running less unnecessary distances and doing less unnecessary work." Now, the number of lap waste from the leather rollers of these female workers who have learned the Hao Jianxiu work method has been reduced by about 45% compared to before. In order to lay the foundation for the promotion work in Shanghai's cotton textile factories, the State-owned Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Cotton Textile Factories, as well as the private Yong'an Third Factory, Shenxin First Factory, and Hongfeng Yarn Factory, have selected 47 workers to study at the Third Cotton Textile Factory.

The promotion work in Tianjin's cotton textile factories is also underway. The Hao Jianxiu Work Method School, established to cultivate Hao Jianxiu-style workers, has been completed. The 330 outstanding fine yarn workers and technicians who participated in the study have returned to their respective factories to carry out promotion work. During the study period, the workers enriched and developed the Hao Jianxiu work method with the spirit of learning the Kovalev work method. At the same time, the factories promoted the short-end piecing method of Sun Shirong from the Fifth Cotton Textile Factory and Wang Shulan from the Hengyuan Yarn Factory, and learned the advantages of Meng Shuyuan's work method, which created a new record for the city in reducing the amount of lap waste from the leather rollers.

The promotion work in the Central and Southern District has begun in Wuhan. On September 13th, when Hao Jianxiu-style worker Zhu Zaodi and others performed at the First Yarn Factory, the entire fine yarn workshop was in an uproar. The workers all said, "This method is really good," and asked to participate in the study first. The First Yarn Factory and the four major yarn factories, including Zhenhuan, Yuhua, and Shenxin, have all established key pilot groups. After studying, the amount of lap waste from the leather rollers of Xu Juying, a labor model at the First Yarn Factory, has been reduced by 81% compared to before. The pilot groups in other factories have also made achievements.

In the Northwest District, the Northwest Textile Industry Promotion Hao Jianxiu Work Method Committee has been established, and the Northwest Textile Construction Company's Second Factory has been used as a key pilot for promotion, achieving preliminary results. The Tian Xueli group, which participated in the experiment in the First Factory, reduced the amount of lap waste from the leather rollers from 24 taels to 8 taels, and the output of 20-count yarn also increased from 1.09 pounds per spindle to 1.1 pounds. According to the preliminary study results of worker Guo Yunhe from the Second Factory, after working for 6 hours and 40 minutes and watching 210 spindles, the amount of lap waste from the leather rollers has been reduced from about 14 taels to 1 or 2 taels.

Workers in textile factories in Northeast and Southwest China are also enthusiastically participating in the study of the Hao Jianxiu work method. The Northeast Textile Administration Bureau and the Northeast Regional Committee of the China Textile Trade Union have formed a promotion team with the 10 students who participated in the Qingdao Hao Jianxiu Work Method Study Class and sent them to the Fourth Textile Factory for key experiments. The workers in the spinning mills in Northeast China feel that the Hao Jianxiu work method has pointed out a new way for increasing production and practicing economy. Cao Renming, who participated in the promotion team at the Jinzhou Textile Factory, said: "Reducing the amount of lap waste from the leather rollers is in line with Chairman Gao Gang's call for increasing production and practicing economy. Implementing the Hao Jianxiu work method throughout the Northeast can increase the production of two or three thousand pieces of yarn a year, which can be converted into twenty or thirty thousand tons of grain. We guarantee to do a good job in this promotion work." The promotion work in Chongqing factories in the Southwest District has also achieved significant results. The amount of lap waste from the leather rollers of Chen Shulan's group at the private Shashi Yarn Factory has been reduced from 16 pounds per day in the past to 7 pounds, and the amount of white waste from Peng Wenfu's group at the Xinyu Yarn Factory has also been reduced from 26.7 pounds per day to 5.3 pounds.

    全国各大城市棉纺织厂
    重点推广郝建秀细纱工作法
    全国各地棉纺织工厂已开始重点推行郝建秀式的细纱工作法。
    首先推广郝建秀工作法的青岛各棉纺织厂，绝大部分细纱工人已经基本上学会了这一先进工作法。各厂皮辊花一般的已减少百分之三十至百分之六十五。但是，由于爱国主义的宣传教育工作做得不够，致少数劳动态度不好的工友，发生了藏白花的现象。为了克服这一偏向，青岛各厂已开始进行爱国主义教育的补课运动。
    上海各棉纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法的工作也在积极进行中。九月初，该市出席青岛细纱职工代表会议的二十三位代表返抵上海后，华东纺织管理局及中国纺织工会上海市委员会便帮助他们组成推广小组，到国营第三棉纺织厂中试行重点推广。由于推广中注意了宣传学习郝建秀工作法的政治意义，克服了少数工人中的保守自满思想，并改革了某些工具与旧制度，因而推广工作十分顺利。该厂三十多个细纱女工已学会了郝建秀工作法。开始学习时，部分工人感到整天在车弄里巡回，还要动脑筋，工作太紧张了；到了后来，即感到轻松和有秩序，不像过去松一阵紧一阵了。女工裔式娟过去工作积极，皮辊花曾最少只出六两，但工作无规律，见断头就接，两小时要跑五千二百多步。他学了郝建秀工作法，只跑二千三百八十多步就行了。许多女工都说：“郝建秀工作法真是少跑冤枉路，少干冤枉活的好方法。”现在，这些学会了郝建秀工作法的女工，皮辊花出数已较前减低了百分之四十五左右。为了给上海各棉纺织厂的推广工作打下基础，国营第二、六、七、十一等棉纺织厂及私营永安三厂、申新一厂、鸿丰纱厂等七个厂，已选派了四十七位工人，到第三棉纺织厂学习。
    天津市各棉纺织厂的推广工作也在进行中。为培养郝建秀工作者而成立的郝建秀工作法学校业已结束。参加学习的三百三十位优秀的细纱工人和技术人员，已返回各厂进行推广工作。学习期间，工人以学习郭瓦廖夫工作法的精神，充实和发展了郝建秀工作法。各厂同时推广了第五棉纺织厂孙士荣和恒源纱厂王淑兰的缩短接头时间的接头法，并且学习了创该市少出皮辊花新纪录的孟淑媛工作法中的优点。
    中南区的推广工作已在武汉开始。九月十三日，当郝建秀工作者朱早弟等在第一纱厂表演时，整个细纱间的工人都轰动起来了。工人都说“这办法真好”，纷纷要求首先参加学习。第一纱厂和震寰、裕华、申新等四大纱厂，都成立了重点试验小组。经过学习后，第一纱厂劳动模范徐菊英的皮辊花出数已比以前减少了百分之八十一。其他各厂试验小组也有了成绩。
    在西北区，西北纺织业推广郝建秀工作法委员会已告成立，并已以西北纺织建设公司第二厂为重点试行推广，获得初步成绩。第一厂参加试验的田学礼小组，皮辊花已由二十四两降低到八两，二十支纱的产量，也由每锭的一点零九磅提高到一点一磅。第二厂工人郭云何初步学习的结果，一天工作六小时四十分，看二百一十个锭子，皮辊花已由十四两左右减到了一、二两。
    东北、西南各地纺织厂的工人，也热烈参加学习郝建秀工作法。东北纺织管理局与中国纺织工会东北区委员会已把参加青岛郝建秀工作法学习班的十位学员组成推广组，到第四纺织厂作重点试验。东北各纺纱厂的工人，觉得郝建秀工作法给增产节约指出了新的办法。金州纺织厂参加推广组的曹任明说：“减少皮辊花正符合高岗主席增产节约的号召，实行郝建秀工作法全东北一年就可以增产二、三千件纱，可折合二、三万吨粮食。我们保证要作好这次推广工作。西南区重庆市各厂的推广工作也已有了显著成绩。私营沙市纱厂陈树兰小组的皮辊花出数已由过去每天的十六磅降低到七磅，新裕纱厂彭文富小组的白花也由每天的二十六点七磅降低到五点三磅。
