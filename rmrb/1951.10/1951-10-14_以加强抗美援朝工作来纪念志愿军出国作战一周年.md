    Commemorate the First Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Participation in the Korean War by Strengthening the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    October 25th this year marks the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean War. The China Peace Committee issued a proclamation on the 13th, calling on the people of the whole country to carry out various commemorative activities on this day, warmly celebrate the great victories achieved by the Chinese people's movement to Resist America and Aid Korea on the Korean front and at home over the past year, and strive for greater victories in the struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea by diligently implementing the patriotic donation plan, further popularizing and deepening the patriotic compact movement, and launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy. The China Peace Committee's call is very important, and we hope that all patriotic compatriots, both men and women throughout the country, will respond enthusiastically.
    At present, American imperialism is rearming Japan, attempting to use Japan as a tool for aggression against China and Asia; and continues to obstruct the progress of the Korean armistice negotiations. All the facts prove that American imperialism is not reconciled to its defeat, and all the facts prove that we must continue to strengthen the struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea in order to force the enemy to accept a just armistice agreement through long-term struggle and stop the war of aggression in Korea.
    In order to achieve this goal, the people of the whole country must strengthen the movement to donate aircraft and cannons and strive to implement the patriotic donation plan. In this work, we have already made great achievements. As of the 12th, the weapon donations actually received by the People's Bank of China in various places have reached 1,856.77488 billion yuan, accounting for 47.3 percent of the total amount pledged (3,927 billion yuan). The people of the whole country should make persistent efforts to complete the entire donation plan, and strive to complete and exceed the original plan ahead of schedule, so as to supply the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army with more aircraft, cannons and other weapons in a timely manner, so that they can more effectively strike the enemy and consolidate national defense.
    In order to strengthen the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, and to educate ourselves in the spirit of patriotism over a long period of time, the people of the whole country should universally establish and earnestly implement patriotic compacts. According to statistics from the North China and East China Administrative Regions, the number of people who have now established patriotic compacts only accounts for about half of the total population, and a considerable part of them are not well established, or have not been earnestly implemented due to a lack of organizational leadership after the establishment. The people of the whole country should respond to the call of the China Peace Committee, and on or around October 25th, use their spare time to hold group or family discussions, check the results of each of us in implementing the patriotic compact and the achievements of the work of resisting America and aiding Korea over the past year, discover and reward models for implementing the patriotic compact, and discuss ways to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea in the future. Those who have not yet established a patriotic compact should establish it after careful preparation and discussion by everyone.
    In order to strengthen the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, and in order to further improve our lives and develop the prosperity and strength of the motherland, the people of the whole country should launch a large-scale movement to increase production, practice economy, and oppose waste around the promotion of patriotic compacts and the donation of aircraft and cannons. Only when we all increase production and practice economy according to our specific circumstances can we fundamentally strengthen the strength of the people of the whole country to resist America and aid Korea, and strengthen the construction work of our country. Therefore, increasing production and practicing economy is one of the most important patriotic political tasks of the people of the whole country at present. Some places have neglected the principle that donations should be combined with increased production when carrying out the patriotic donation movement, and some places have generated the idea that "the work of resisting America and aiding Korea can be relaxed" after completing the donation plan. These practices and ideas are wrong and should be corrected and prevented.

    以加强抗美援朝工作来纪念志愿军出国作战一周年
    今年十月二十五日是中国人民志愿军出国作战的一周年纪念日。抗美援朝总会已于十三日发出文告，号召全国人民在这一天进行各种纪念活动，热烈庆祝一年来中国人民抗美援朝运动在朝鲜前线和在国内所取得的伟大胜利，并以努力执行爱国捐献计划，进一步普及深入爱国公约运动和开展增产节约运动，来争取抗美援朝斗争的更大胜利。抗美援朝总会的这个号召是十分重要的，我们希望全国男女爱国同胞一致热烈响应。
    目前美帝国主义正在重新武装日本，企图利用日本作为侵略中国和亚洲的工具；并继续阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的进行。一切事实都证明美帝国主义是不甘心于它的失败的，一切事实都证明我们必须继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，以便用长期的奋斗来迫使敌人接受公正的停战协定，在朝鲜停止侵略战争。
    为着达到这个目的，我们全国人民必须加强捐献飞机大炮运动，努力执行爱国捐献计划。在这个工作中，目前我们已经取得很大成绩。截至十二日止，各地中国人民银行实收的武器捐款已经达到一万八千五百六十七亿七千四百八十八万余元，即占认捐总数（三万九千二百七十亿元）的百分之四十七点三。我们全国人民应该再接再厉，完成全部捐献计划，并争取提前完成和超过原订的计划，以便及时地把更多的飞机、大炮等武器供给志愿军和解放军，使他们能够更有效地打击敌人，并巩固国防。
    为着加强抗美援朝运动，并在长时期内以爱国主义的精神来教育我们自己，我们全国人民都应该普遍订立和认真执行爱国公约。据华北、华东两大行政区的统计，各地现在已经订立爱国公约者仅占总人口一半左右，而且其中有相当大一部分订立得不够好，或者在订立后因缺乏组织领导而没有认真执行。我们全国人民都应该响应抗美援朝总会的号召，在十月二十五日或其前后，利用业余时间，举行小组或家庭讨论会，检查我们每个人自己执行爱国公约的成绩和一年来抗美援朝工作的成绩，发现和奖励执行爱国公约的模范，并讨论今后加强抗美援朝工作的办法。凡是尚未订立爱国公约的，都应该经过大家认真的准备和讨论之后，把爱国公约订立起来。
    为着加强抗美援朝运动，为着进一步改善我们的生活和发展祖国的富强、繁荣，我们全国人民都应该围绕着推行爱国公约和捐献飞机大炮的工作，开展一个大规模的增加生产和节约及反浪费的运动。只有我们都根据自己的具体情况来增产、节约，才能在根本上加强我们全国人民的抗美援朝力量，才能加强我们国家的建设工作。因此，增产、节约是目前我们全国人民最重要的爱国政治任务之一。有些地方在开展爱国捐献运动时，忽视了捐献应与增产结合的方针，有些地方在完成了捐献计划之后，产生了“抗美援朝工作可以松一口气了”的思想，这些作法和想法都是不对的，应该加以纠正和防止。
