    A New Upsurge in the Rural Patriotic Movement
    Xiaowen
    With the widespread development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, rural areas in 1951 presented a new look.

    In many rural areas, farmers often heatedly discussed national affairs. In some villages, after finishing work in the fields, farmers would first find a newspaper to read before eating. When they met, they would ask each other, "How is the patriotic pact being implemented?" Some farmers even posted the patriotic pact they had made below the portrait of Chairman Mao, wanting to show their respect for Chairman Mao by implementing the actions in the patriotic pact. Xie Suo'er, a farmer from the Fourth District of Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, would sit with the portrait of Chairman Mao for a while every night. He said, "When I am producing in the fields, I often think of the patriotic pact. If I don't act according to the pact, I feel like I can't go home to see Chairman Mao (referring to the portrait of Chairman Mao)." In Songtun Village, Gaiping County, Liaodong Province, when the news spread that they were preparing to mobilize fifteen laborers to go to Korea, more than twenty young people eagerly volunteered. They had to decide based on the order of registration. The fifteen laborers who went to the front line were all active and brave, and thirteen of them had already earned military merits. Farmers in En Village, Lihe Village, and three other villages in Xiuwu County, Pingyuan Province, compared the old society and the new China when formulating the patriotic pact: In the three years before liberation, the enemy killed 163 farmers, robbed 467,250 catties of grain, robbed 151 head of livestock, and left 1,614 mu of land uncultivated. In the three years after liberation, there was an increase of 514 head of livestock, the People's Government lent 450,000 catties of grain, lent 213 waterwheels, and built 141 houses. The farmers' conclusion was: "In the old society, families were broken and people lived like animals; in the new China, wealth and people are thriving, and the five grains are abundant." They wrote in the patriotic pact: "Without the new China, there would be no good times. As long as the motherland needs it, we will give money if we have money, and people if we have people." In many villages in Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Hebei provinces, young farmers wrote their names on the patriotic pacts, shouting solemn oaths to the motherland: "We are ready to be called upon by the motherland at any time and voluntarily go to Korea to resist America." These are not isolated examples. In most rural areas of the country, more than half of the villages or population have established patriotic pacts. Eighty percent of the population in rural Hebei Province and ninety percent of families in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, have already established patriotic pacts.

    When the General Association to Resist America, Aid Korea issued three major calls on June 1st, farmers in various places responded enthusiastically. Production mutual aid teams in various rural areas formulated plans for increased production and donations, and a wave of donations quickly spread across the country. Farmers and people from all walks of life in the North Sichuan Administrative Region have overfulfilled the plan to donate 29 fighter planes, 2 artillery pieces, and 2 anti-aircraft guns. Farmers in Taicang County, Southern Jiangsu District, originally planned to donate one fighter plane, but within a week, they had overpaid 1.711 billion yuan. An old woman in Luling District of the county wanted to donate ten catties of cotton. Others thought she had no labor and advised her not to donate, but she said, "I have been emancipated in the new China, and I have a share in loving the country and protecting my home!" Han En, a labor model in Bao'an Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, immediately convened all the farmers in the mutual aid team to discuss and specifically study ways to increase production and donations after seeing the three major calls of the General Association to Resist America, Aid Korea published in the newspaper. He took the lead in subscribing to 1 million yuan in Renminbi, and the entire team donated 4 million yuan from increased production. Farmers in Jingju Village, Meishan County, Western Sichuan District, were busy drying and cleaning the rice several days before paying the donated grain. Some cleaned it twice. All 11,900 catties of donated grain were handed over on September 10th in one day. More than 200 people in the village carried it on shoulder poles or on their backs and sent it to the city that day. The Fugui Village in Danzhai County, Guizhou, where the Miao people live, established a patriotic pact at the end of April this year. In July, they conducted another in-depth review and revision. They decided to apply six more loads of manure per mu of land and increase the yield by one dan of grain for every ten dan of land, in order to increase production and donate 8,000 catties of grain. The Miao people, who love singing and dancing, happily sang mountain songs as they walked home from the fields when the sun set in the west: "Resisting America and aiding Korea with one heart, increasing production and cultivating the fields; the patriotic pact is formulated by the group, ensuring that the pact is implemented; there is a check-up meeting every seven days, and those who don't do well will be criticized..."

    On the basis of the rising patriotism of the farmers, an unprecedented and massive patriotic bumper harvest competition movement has been launched in rural areas across the country. This movement began in March, when the well-known labor hero Li Shunda mutual aid team in Shanxi Province sent a patriotic bumper harvest competition letter to all parts of the country. By the end of September, more than 12,000 mutual aid teams and more than 2,700 agricultural labor models in 30 provinces and administrative regions across the country had responded to the Li Shunda mutual aid team. At the same time, "chain competitions" were also launched in various regions. The farmers involved in this production competition included 570,000 mutual aid teams in the three regions of Northeast, Hebei, and Shanxi alone, and more than 10 million farmers across the country participated in this patriotic bumper harvest competition. Another feature of this movement is that it is continuous and develops step by step. Before the summer harvest, 47 mutual aid teams in Shaanxi Province, headed by the famous labor hero Zhang Mingliang, proposed a summer production competition to all parts of the country, and 8,500 mutual aid teams responded to the challenge in a short period of time. When Li Shunda proposed the autumn production competition, labor models and mutual aid teams in various places immediately responded to the challenge, which was more extensive than the spring production competition. The number of mutual aid teams in Shanxi Province directly participating in the spring production competition was 2,045, which increased to more than 2,500 in the summer. The "bumper harvest competition movement" greatly stimulated the farmers' production creativity. The mutual aid team of labor model Gao Guandou in Dahu Village, Shen County, Hebei Province, calculated the average yield per mu of land last year at 250 catties based on the annual income converted into grain. This year, it was originally planned to increase production by 10%, but when he received Li Shunda's competition challenge letter, he led the whole team to discuss and thoroughly discuss various farming conditions and farming techniques. The whole team unanimously decided to respond to Li Shunda with a production plan to increase production to 426 catties per mu. Thanks to Gao Guandou's improved technology, improved soil, and more fertilizer, the autumn harvest results this year showed that six of the seven production mutual aid teams led by Gao Guandou achieved a yield of 430 catties per mu. His own yield per mu reached 660 catties. These many facts show that the patriotic bumper harvest movement has shown great power in the countryside. (Attached picture)

    农村爱国运动的新高涨
    效文
    随着抗美援朝运动的普遍开展，一九五一年的农村呈现了崭新的面貌。
    在许多农村里，农民们经常热烈地谈论着国家大事。有些村的农民干完活从地里回家，先找到报纸看，然后才吃饭，大家见面时，互相询问着：“爱国公约执行得怎么样？”还有些农民把自己订的爱国公约贴在毛主席像的下面，要以执行爱国公约的行动来敬爱毛主席。陕西省富平县四区农民谢锁儿，每天晚上都要陪毛主席像坐一会，他说：“我在地里生产时，常常想起爱国公约，如果不按公约办，就觉得无法回家见毛主席（指毛主席像）。”辽东省盖平县松屯村准备动员十五个民工赴朝鲜，这消息被青年们听到了，有二十多人争着要去，只好按报名先后取决，出发前线的十五个民工都积极勇敢，已有十三人立了战功。平原省修武县恩村、李河等五村农民们，在制订爱国公约时，把旧社会和新中国作一对比：解放前三年中，被敌人打死农民一六三人，抢粮四六七、二五○斤，抢牲口一五一头，荒地一、六一四亩；解放后三年中，增加牲口五一四头，人民政府贷粮四五○、○○○斤，贷水车二一三辆，盖房一四一间，农民们的结论是：“旧社会家破人亡，牛马生活；新中国人财两旺，五谷丰登。”他们在爱国公约上写着：“没有新中国就没有好时光，只要祖国需要，要钱有钱，要人有人。”山西、平原、河北省有不少村庄的青年农民，把名字排列在爱国公约上，向祖国喊出庄严的誓言：“随时听候祖国的召唤，自愿赴朝抗美。”这不是个别的事例。全国多数地区农村，均有半数以上的村庄或人口，订立了爱国公约。河北省农村百分之八十的人口、云南省晋宁县有百分之九十的家庭，已订立了爱国公约。
    当六月一日，抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，各地农民纷纷响应，各农村生产互助组制订出增产捐献计划，捐献热潮迅速波及全国。川北行政区农民和各界人民已超额完成捐献战斗机二十九架、大炮二门、高射炮二门的计划。苏南区太仓县农民原计划捐献战斗机一架，一周内即超额缴款十七亿一千万元。该县陆陵区一个老太婆要捐十斤棉花，别人认为她没劳力，劝她不必捐，她说：“在新中国我翻了身，爱国保家有我的一份啊！”吉林省蛟河县保安村劳动模范韩恩，看到报上发表抗美援朝总会的三大号召，立即召集全互助组农民进行讨论，具体研究增产捐献的办法，他自己带头认捐人民币一百万元，全组从增产中捐献四百万元。川西区眉山县净居村农民在缴捐献粮的前几天，便忙着把稻谷晒干风净，有的风两道，一万一千九百余斤献粮，九月十日，一天全部交齐。该村二百多人，挑的挑，背的背，当天又都送到城里去了。苗族人民聚居的贵州丹寨县富贵村，在今年四月底，就订立了爱国公约，七月间，他们又进行了一次深入的检查与修正。他们决定每亩田多施六担粪，每十石田增产一担谷的收成，以增产捐献八千斤谷子。喜爱歌舞的苗民们，每当日落西山，从地里回家的时候，一面走一面愉快的唱着山歌：“抗美援朝一条心，增加生产把田耕；爱国公约小组订，保证公约要实行；七天一次检查会，那家不好要批评……”
    在农民爱国主义高涨的基础上，全国农村掀起了空前未有声势浩大的爱国丰产竞赛运动。这一运动自三月间，山西省著名劳动英雄李顺达互助组，向全国各地发出爱国丰产竞赛书开始，截止九月底止，全国已有三十个省、行署区的一万二千多个互助组，二千七百多个农业劳动模范向李顺达互助组应战。同时在各地区还展开了“连环竞赛”，投入这个生产竞赛的农民，仅东北、河北、山西三个地区即有五十七万个互助组，全国各地尚有一千万以上农民参加了这个爱国丰产竞赛。这一运动的另一特点是连续进行、步步发展。在夏收前，以陕西省著名劳动英雄张明亮为首的该省四十七个互助组，又向全国各地提出夏季生产竞赛，在较短时间内，即有八千五百个互助组应了战。当李顺达又提出秋季生产竞赛后，各地劳动模范和互助组，立即纷纷应战，较之春季生产竞赛的范围，更加广泛。山西省直接参加春季生产竞赛的互助组是二千零四十五个，夏季即增加到二千五百余互助组了。“丰产竞赛运动”大大激发了农民的生产创造性。河北深县大护驾庄村劳动模范高贯斗的互助组，按全年收入折谷计算，每亩土地平均产量，去年是二百五十斤。今年原计划增产一成，但当他接到李顺达竞赛挑战书后，便领导全组讨论，详尽的讨论了各种耕作条件、耕作技术，全组一致决议以增产至每亩产量四百二十六斤的生产计划向李顺达应战。由于高贯斗改进技术，改良土壤，多施肥，今年秋收结果，高贯斗领导的七个生产互助组，有六个小组每亩产量达四百三十斤。他自己每亩地的产量高达六百六十斤。这许多事实，说明爱国丰产运动已在农村中显示了伟大的力量。（附图片）
