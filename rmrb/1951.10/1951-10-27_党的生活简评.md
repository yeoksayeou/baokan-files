Brief Commentary on Party Life

An Important Method for Party Committees to Understand the Situation

　　Carefully studying letters and submissions from newspaper readers to understand the work dynamics and existing problems in various regions, and promptly resolving them, is an important method for Party leading organs to understand the situation. The Henan Provincial Party Committee discovered policy issues in the work of the Huaiyang area from two submissions to the newspaper. The first submission stated that in the Huaiyang democratic reform movement, the local Party committee decided to confiscate all landlord houses in back streets (except for main streets and other streets with businesses) and distribute them to poor urban residents, and that the prices of houses sold by landlords after the announcement of the democratic reform would be recovered as the fruits of the masses' struggle. At the same time, landlords were stopped from selling their houses. The other submission stated: "The second step of the democratic reform of the streets can be transitioned to confiscating and distributing houses." This submission also put forward a series of specific policies and work methods and steps for house distribution.

　　Based on this situation, the Henan Provincial Party Committee immediately inquired with the Huaiyang local Party committee, pointing out that "If the above reports are true, they are completely wrong." It also instructed that there should be a strict policy boundary between the democratic reform movement in small towns and the land reform review movement, and they must not be confused. In the democratic reform movement, the rural struggle methods must not be mechanically moved to the cities, and taking the method of confiscating and distributing urban landlord houses will inevitably cause great chaos and serious losses to the people.

　　The Henan Provincial Party Committee, through the newspaper, contacted the masses, understood the work situation, and promptly corrected the deviations, stopping the "leftist" tendencies in the democratic reform movement in small cities. This experience is worth promoting.

    党的生活简评
    党委了解情况的一个重要方法
    认真研究报纸读者的来信来稿以便了解各个地区工作动态和存在的问题及时地加以解决，这是党的领导机关了解情况的一个重要的方法。中共河南省委从报社两件来稿中发现了淮阳地区工作上存在的政策性问题。第一篇稿子提出在淮阳民主改革运动中，地委曾决定除大街及其他有生意的街道外，背街地主房子一律没收分给贫苦市民，并决定自民主改革宣布后地主出卖的房价一律追回，作为群众的斗争果实。同时停止地主出卖权。另一篇来稿则称：“街道的民主改革第二步即可转入没收分配房子。”这篇稿子并提出了分房中一系列的具体政策及工作方法步骤等。
    河南省委根据这一情况，当即查询淮阳地委，指出“如果以上报导属实，是完全错误的”。并指示：小城镇的民主改革运动同土地改革复查运动两者之间要有严格的政策界限，绝不能相混淆。在民主改革运动中不能机械地把农村斗争方式搬到城市中来，对城市地主房屋采取没收分配的方法，这势必造成极大混乱，给人民带来严重损失。
    河南省委通过报纸联系群众，了解工作情况，及时纠正了偏向，停止了在小城市民主改革运动的“左”的偏向，这一经验值得推广。
