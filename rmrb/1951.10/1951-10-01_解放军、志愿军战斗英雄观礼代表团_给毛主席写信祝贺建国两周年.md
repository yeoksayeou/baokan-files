    Combat Heroes Observation Delegation of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army
    Write to Chairman Mao to Congratulate the Second Anniversary of the Founding of the Country
    [Xinhua News Agency, September 30] The Combat Heroes National Day Observation Delegation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the eve of National Day to pay their respects. The full text is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    The entire delegation of the Combat Heroes National Day Observation Delegation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with infinite excitement and sincere respect, warmly congratulates you and the Central People's Government on the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    In the past two years, under your wise leadership, and on the basis of the original land reform, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of more than 310 million across the country, overthrowing the feudal system in rural areas, liberating rural productive forces, and opening up broad avenues for the restoration and development of industry. Due to the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries throughout the country, and also due to the establishment of governments at all levels and the convening of representative conferences of all sectors, the people's democratic dictatorship and the people's democratic united front have been further consolidated and developed. As soon as the People's Republic of China was founded, it established diplomatic relations with nineteen countries, including the socialist Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and other countries, and signed the historically significant "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" and other friendly agreements between China and the Soviet Union. This not only powerfully consolidated the peace and democracy camp and greatly enhanced our country's international status, but also provided a strong guarantee for our country's construction. In the restoration and development of economic construction, a nationwide patriotic production competition movement has been launched enthusiastically. The brilliant achievements made by this movement demonstrate the bright prospects for the economic prosperity and national defense consolidation of the new China. When American imperialism carried out a beastly invasion of neighboring Korea and threatened the security of the motherland, the Chinese people could no longer tolerate it and organized the Volunteer Army to enter Korea and fight the American aggressors shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, and launched a large-scale patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea throughout the country. Therefore, on the Korean front, from the beginning of the Sino-Korean People's Army fighting the American aggressors side by side in October of last year to the present, more than 320,000 American and Li bandit gangs have been eliminated, inspiring the people of the world, especially the people of all oppressed nations, to defend peace and resist aggression. On the other hand, the motherland people's vigorous patriotic movement has greatly enhanced the political consciousness of the masses of people across the country and promoted the three central tasks of resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform across the country. The unity of the people across the country has been further consolidated.
    In the past two years, as the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which you personally nurtured to safeguard the security of the motherland and world peace, has liberated the mainland of China, realizing an unprecedented situation of national unity; in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, it has thoroughly suppressed all bandits in the newly liberated areas, annihilating nearly two million bandits. In the suppression of bandits, outstanding heroes of the Matrosov type such as Xu Hanlin, Xiao Guobao, and Wang Yushan emerged; in order to defend national defense and world peace, large-scale political and military training movements have been carried out, improving the troops' spirit of patriotism and internationalism, and greatly promoting revolutionary heroism. Under your call, the army is moving towards regularization and modernization, and has built a fairly strong air force and navy. Our army has become a powerful force for defending the motherland and world peace.
    Although American imperialism has suffered a heavy blow in Korea, it still has no remorse and has even concluded a separate peace with Japan, occupying and rearming Japan for a long time, making the security of the motherland and world peace still under serious threat. We are determined to continue to launch a military training movement throughout the army under your leadership, build our army into a stronger and more modern army, and be ready to carry out your orders at any time, to fight against aggressors, defend the motherland, and defend the peace of the Far East and the world!

    [Xinhua News Agency, September 30] The Combat Heroes National Day Observation Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the eve of National Day. The text is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of our motherland, all comrades of our delegation extend our highest respects to you, our dearest leader!
    After returning to China, we personally experienced the honor given to us by the people of the motherland, which greatly encouraged us. In particular, seeing the achievements of the motherland's construction in all aspects and the joy of the people, we deeply felt the loveliness of the motherland, and at the same time deeply realized the merits of your wise leadership. We wholeheartedly wish you good health forever.
    Under your wise leadership, the facts of the past two years have proved that our motherland not only has the strength to defend its own security, but also has the strength to defend peace in the Far East. Our Volunteer Army, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield, has used repeated victories to illustrate that we have the strength to defeat the aggressor - American imperialism and its accomplices. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of our motherland, we report to you: We have become stronger in the past eleven months of fighting, and we are fully confident to continue to strike at the aggressors, defend the security of the motherland and peace in the Far East.

    给毛主席写信祝贺建国两周年
    【新华社三十日讯】中国人民解放军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表团国庆前夕写信给毛主席致敬，全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    中国人民解放军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表团全体代表，谨以无限的兴奋和诚挚的敬意，向您和中央人民政府热烈地祝贺中华人民共和国建国两周年。
    两年来，在您英明的领导下，在原有土地改革的基础上，全国三亿一千万以上人口的地区完成了土地改革，推翻了农村的封建制度，解放了农村生产力，为恢复与发展工业开辟了广阔的道路。由于在全国范围内进行了轰轰烈烈的镇压反革命运动，也由于各级政府的建立和各界代表会议的召开，人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线得到了更进一步的巩固与发展。中华人民共和国刚一成立，即与社会主义苏联、各人民民主国家以及其他国家等十九个国家建立了外交关系，并和苏联签订了具有历史意义的“中苏友好同盟互助条约”及其他中苏两国间友好的协定，这样不仅有力地巩固了和平民主阵营，大大地提高了我国的国际地位，而且使我国的建设得到了有力的保障。在恢复与发展经济建设上，全国热烈地展开了爱国主义的生产竞赛运动，这一运动所造成的光辉成就，显示了新中国经济繁荣国防巩固的光明远景。在美帝国主义对邻邦朝鲜进行兽性的侵略并威胁着祖国的安全的时候，中国人民忍无可忍，组织了志愿军进入朝鲜与朝鲜人民军并肩打击美国侵略者，并在全国范围之内展开了规模宏大的抗美援朝的爱国运动，因而在朝鲜前线，从去年十月中朝人民军队并肩打击美国侵略者开始到现在，消灭了美李匪帮在三十二万人以上，鼓舞了全世界人民、特别是各被压迫民族人民保卫和平反抗侵略的决心与信心。而另一方面，祖国人民轰轰烈烈的爱国运动，又大大地提高了全国人民群众的政治觉悟，推动了全国人民抗美援朝、镇压反革命和土地改革三大中心任务。全国人民的团结是更加巩固了。
    两年来，作为保卫祖国安全与世界和平的您所亲手抚养起来的中国人民解放军，解放了全国大陆，实现了前所未有的全国统一的局面；为了巩固人民民主专政，对新解放区所有土匪进行了彻底的清剿，歼匪近二百万，在剿匪中出现了徐汉林、萧国宝、王玉山这样马特洛索夫式的出色的英雄；为了保卫国防与世界和平，进行了大规模的政治的和军事的练兵运动，提高了部队爱国主义与国际主义的精神，极大地发扬了革命英雄主义。在您的号召下，陆军正在向正规化和现代化迈进，并且建设了相当强大的空军和海军，我军已经成为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的强大的力量。
    美帝国主义虽然在朝鲜遭到了沉痛的打击，但它仍无悔过之心，竟与日本单独媾和，长期占领并重新武装日本，使祖国安全与世界和平仍受着严重的威胁。我们决心在您的领导下，继续在全军展开练兵运动，把我军建设成为更加强大的现代化的军队，随时准备执行您的命令，为反抗侵略者、保卫祖国、保卫远东与世界和平而战斗！

    在您英明的领导下，两年来的事实，证明我们祖国不仅有力量保卫自己的安全，而且有力量保卫远东的和平。我们志愿军在朝鲜战场上，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，已用迭次的胜利说明：我们有力量打败侵略者——美帝国主义及其帮凶。在我们祖国国庆二周年的时候，我们向您报告：我们在过去十一个月的战斗中，已经锻炼得更加坚强，我们完全有信心，继续打击侵略者，保卫祖国的安全和远东的和平。
