    Hastening Autumn Plowing

    Plowing the autumn fields well is an important task on the current agricultural production front.

    There are many benefits to autumn plowing. Local folk sayings summarize the farmers' rich experience in this regard. For example: "One plowing in autumn is better than three hoeings next year," "An inch deeper in autumn plowing is worth a layer of manure," "If one family doesn't plow in autumn, thousands of families will suffer from pests," and so on. Autumn plowing can increase the soil's water retention capacity to prevent spring drought; it can reduce pests; and it can increase soil fertility. These benefits are all explained in the aforementioned folk sayings. Autumn plowing is particularly important in the provinces of North China and certain regions of other provinces, which are prone to spring droughts and frequent outbreaks of various diseases and pests every year.

    Autumn plowing is a heavy and meticulous task, and the work can only be done well by strengthening organization and leadership. Local county, district, and village people's governments should formulate practical autumn plowing plans based on the local labor force, animal power, and autumn plowing area. They must be good at allocating time and rationally arranging various tasks that run parallel with autumn plowing.

    In the autumn plowing plan, attention should be paid to solving the problem of animal power, because autumn plowing mainly relies on animal power, and in some areas, animal power is still insufficient. This requires attention to organizing the masses for mutual aid and rationally resolving the problem of equivalent value for labor and animal power exchange.

    It is now late autumn. In order to complete the autumn plowing task before the ground freezes, all regions must make an effort. Launch a patriotic and productive autumn plowing mutual aid competition among farmers to lay a good foundation for increased agricultural production next year.

    赶快进行秋耕工作
    把秋地耕好，是当前农业生产战线上的一项重要工作。
    秋耕的好处是很多的。各地的农谚总结了农民在这方面的丰富经验。如：“秋天犁一犁，胜过明年锄三遍”，“秋耕深一寸，顶上一层粪”，“一家不秋耕，千家受虫害”，等等。秋耕可以增加土壤的保水能力，以预防春旱；可以减少虫害；可以增加地力。这些好处，都在上述农谚中说明了。华北各省及其他省份的若干地区，每年易遭春旱，各种病虫灾害经常发生，秋耕尤为重要。
    秋耕工作是一个繁重细致的工作，必须加强组织领导，才能把秋耕工作做好。各地县、区、村人民政府，应该根据本地区劳力、畜力与秋耕面积等情况，作出切实可行的秋耕计划，要善于支配时间，合理安排和秋耕并行的各种工作。
    在秋耕计划中，应该注意解决畜力问题，因为秋耕主要依靠畜力，而在若干地区，畜力还是很不够的。这就必须注意组织群众变工互助，合理解决人力与畜力变工的等价问题。
    现在已是深秋，为了在地冻前完成秋耕任务，各地必须努一把力。发动农民掀起一个爱国丰产秋耕互助竞赛，为明年农业增产打下良好的基础。
