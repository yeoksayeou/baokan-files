    Brief Commentary on Economic Life

    Guo Jinyu Rejoins the Mutual Aid Team
    Guo Jinyu, the director of the cooperative in Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, an old revolutionary base area in Shanxi Province, withdrew from the mutual aid team this spring, but returned to the mutual aid team in the autumn. Guo Jinyu joined the mutual aid team as early as 1943. Relying on the strength of being organized, he overcame the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power during the Anti-Japanese War. His production conditions gradually improved, and his life gradually became prosperous. Under these conditions, Guo Jinyu developed the idea of ​​"going it alone." His family has five people, more than thirteen mu of land, and one head of cattle; he believes that with his labor, "he can farm the land well without being too tight or too loose." So he withdrew from the mutual aid team. Before the autumn harvest, when the whole village was "comparing crops," Guo Jinyu found that his field yielded six dou of grain less per mu than the fields of the mutual aid team! Is it that Guo Jinyu was not actively working? Absolutely not, he himself worked very actively. The problem is that one person working often can't keep up. He hoed the ground fewer times than the mutual aid team; he had more than forty dan of manure stored at home, but he couldn't transport it to the fields due to insufficient labor; when the autumn crops turned yellow, Guo Jinyu was also unable to harvest them all at once, and he watched as the ripe grains were about to fall to the ground. At this time, Guo Jinyu realized and returned to the mutual aid team, and with everyone's help, he was able to smoothly harvest the crops.
    Guo Jinyu's experience has profound educational significance for many farmers. Because after the land reform, especially after several years of the great production movement, some farmers' thoughts of "going it alone" have risen again. Guo Jinyu left the mutual aid team in order to make a personal fortune; after encountering setbacks, he still returned to the mutual aid team, which shows the power of "getting organized" and proves that scattered production farmers can only find a real way out by taking the path of cooperation and mutual assistance, that is, the path of collectivism.

    经济生活简评
    郭金玉重新回到互助组
    山西老区平顺县川底村合作社主任郭金玉，在今年春天退出了互助组，到秋天又回到互助组来了。郭金玉早在一九四三年就参加了互助组，凭着组织起来的力量，克服了在抗日战争时期劳力、畜力不足的困难，生产条件逐年改善，生活也逐渐富裕。在这种条件之下，郭金玉滋长了“单干”思想。他家有五口人，十三亩多地，一头耕牛；他认为凭着他这个劳力，“不松不紧就能把地种好”。于是他退出了互助组。秋收以前，全村“比庄稼”的时候，郭金玉发现自己的田比互助组的田每亩要少收六斗粮食！难道是郭金玉劳动得不积极么？绝对不是，他自己劳动得是很积极的。问题在于一个人劳动，常常忙不过来。他锄地的遍数赶不上互助组；他家里存着四十多担粪，也因劳力不足，不能运到田里；秋禾黄了，郭金玉也无力一下子收回家，眼看黄熟的谷粒，就要掉到地上。这时郭金玉觉悟过来，又回到了互助组，得到大家的帮助，才顺利地把庄稼收割到家。
    郭金玉的这番经历，对许多农民都有深刻的教育意义。因为在土地改革以后，特别是经过几年大生产运动以后，有些农民的“单干”思想又抬头了。郭金玉为了个人发家而离开互助组；碰壁以后，仍然回到互助组，这就显示了“组织起来”的力量，证明分散生产的农民，只有走合作互助，也就是走集体主义的道路，才是真正的出路。
