    Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group Decides to Sell All New Cotton to the State
    Initiates Cotton Sales and Storage Competition Among Cotton Farmers Nationwide
    The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group, which created the highest unit area yield of cotton in the country, has decided to sell all of its cotton to the state as soon as possible, and has launched a patriotic cotton sales and storage challenge to mutual aid groups and cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country. The full text of the challenge letter is as follows:
    Brothers in mutual aid groups and cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country:
    This year's cotton crop is a bumper year, with annual production breaking the highest cotton production record in Chinese history. Our mutual aid group's cotton is also growing very well, with a yield increase of 287 jin of seed cotton per mu compared to last year; this is the result of the support and guidance of the People's Government and the strong support of our worker brothers. Therefore, in order to consolidate our motherland and consolidate our alliance with our worker brothers, we must sell all of this year's bumper cotton crop to the state to ensure the needs of our national textile industry. We must achieve the following: First, sign contracts with the state trade company and sell and store all cotton to the state through the performance of the contracts. We have already signed pre-sale and credit pre-sale contracts with the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, guaranteeing that all 6,470 jin of lint cotton and 6,498 jin of seed cotton produced by the group this year will be sold and stored to the state. Second, in order to sell and store cotton to the state as quickly as possible, mobilize all able-bodied people in the group to participate in picking and drying work, ensuring that picking and drying are done simultaneously, and that cotton is delivered to state-owned companies collectively every five days to shorten the state's purchase time. From September 10th to the end of October, ensure that all cotton is picked, sold, and stored, and that it is picked and delivered in three phases according to the foot, waist, and top, to ensure that it meets the specifications required by industry. Third, in order to reduce the time it takes for cotton to reach factories due to ginning by the state, we have repaired two cotton ginning machines and organized manual ginning, striving to gin all the cotton in the group as quickly as possible and sell it to the state. Fourth, to fully supply the raw cotton needs of the national textile industry, each member of our group will only keep three jin of cotton batting, and the rest will be made from old cotton batting. Fifth, select and plant 7,000 jin of waist cotton, gin more than 2,000 jin of cottonseed, and exchange the remaining seeds, except for 1,000 jin for the group's own cotton planting next year, with other groups in the village to promote the superior variety of "S" cotton. We have now begun to fulfill our conditions. Qu Yaoli has sold all 1,500 jin of seed cotton that has been picked and stored to the state, and the entire group has sold and stored more than 6,000 jin.
    Brothers in mutual aid groups and cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country! We believe that you will happily participate in this patriotic cotton sales and storage competition and build our motherland into a more prosperous and powerful nation!
    With a fighting salute!
                           Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group, October 1, 1951

    曲耀离互助组决将新棉全部售储给国家
    向全国棉农发起售棉储棉竞赛
    创造全国棉田单位面积最高产量的曲耀离互助组决定要把自己的棉花尽早地全部售储给国家，并向全国产棉区互助组及棉农发起爱国售棉储棉挑战。挑战书全文如下：全国产棉区互助组和棉农兄弟们：
    今年的棉花是一个丰收年景，年产量突破了中国历史上产棉量最高纪录。我们互助组的棉花也长得很好，每亩产量比去年增收籽棉二百八十七斤；这是人民政府的扶植指导和工人老大哥对我们有力支援的结果。因此我们为了巩固我们的祖国，巩固我们和工人老大哥的联盟，就要把今年丰收的棉花全部卖给国家，保证我们国家纺织工业的需要。我们一定要作到下面几项：一、和国家贸易公司签订合同，通过履行合同把全部棉花售储给国家。我们已经和花纱布公司签订了预售和信用预售合同，保证将全组今年所产的六千四百七十斤皮棉和六千四百九十八斤籽棉一齐出售和储存给国家。二、为了把棉花尽快尽早地售储给国家，动员全组一切能劳动的人全部参加摘、晒工作，保证作到随摘、随晒，每五天集体向国营公司交花一次，以缩短国家收购时间。从九月十日开始至十月底，保证全部棉花摘完售储完，并作到按足、腰、梢三期分摘分交，保证适合工业需要的规格。三、为减少国家因轧花而拖长棉花到达工厂的时间，我们修理了两部轧花机，组织手工轧花，争取把全组棉花尽可能迅速地轧好售储给国家。四、充分供给国家纺织工业的原棉需要，我们全组每人只留三斤絮棉，其余的使用旧套花。五、分地选种摘七千斤腰花，轧两千多斤棉籽，除一千斤作组内明年植棉用以外，其余的换给全村各组，以推广斯字棉优种。现在我们已开始履行我们的条件，曲耀离已把摘下的一千五百斤籽棉尽数售储给国家，全组也已售储六千多斤。
    全国棉产区互助组和棉农兄弟们！我们相信你们一定会愉快地参加这个爱国售棉储棉竞赛，把我们祖国建设得更繁荣富强！
    致以战斗的敬礼！
                           曲耀离互助组  一九五一年十月一日
