    The Tricks of the American and Japanese Reactionaries

    The Japanese people's voices against the American-made separate peace treaty and the US-Japan military agreement are rising higher and higher, which has caused extreme fear among the American and Japanese reactionaries. Currently, the American and Japanese reactionaries are using both soft and hard tactics in an attempt to suppress the Japanese people's just actions.

    Recently, the Yoshida government is formulating the so-called "Anti-Strike Law," attempting to use it to suppress the strike movement of Japan's six million organized workers who oppose the separate peace treaty and strive for independence. The Yoshida government is also carrying out large-scale arrests of Japanese Communist Party leaders throughout the country. At the same time, Ames, the head of the Labor Section of the Ridgway Headquarters, is "advising" some Japanese labor union leaders that they themselves and their union members should refrain from protesting or expressing opposition to the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan military agreement in the future, attempting to divide the Japanese labor front. Ames threatened Muto, the chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions, and Takano, the secretary-general, that he would kick them out of the General Council; on the other hand, he used bribery to entice the right-wing elements of the General Council, asking them to launch a pro-American movement among organized workers.

    The Yoshida government is desperately trying to use repressive measures to deal with the Japanese people who oppose the separate peace treaty, which can only show that it has a guilty conscience and is unpopular; and Ridgway's despicable means of threatening and bribing to divide the workers' protest movement also shows that he has a guilty conscience and is panicking. However, no matter what means the American and Japanese reactionaries use, they cannot stop the Japanese people's just struggle for independence and survival.

    The Decline of American Education

    The situation of school education in the United States is deteriorating day by day. According to official announcements in the United States, university enrollment has sharply decreased by 250,000 this year compared to last year. Last year, four million school-age children in the United States did not attend school. Due to lack of funding, 250,000 classrooms in the United States do not meet the minimum standards, and the poor equipment and environment seriously threaten children's health.

    The rapid decline of school education in the United States is due to the Truman government using large amounts of money squeezed from the people to expand armaments and prepare for war. Since the United States invaded Korea, it has increased taxes twice and is now preparing to implement a third tax increase. The Truman government not only does not use this money for education, but also cuts education funding to the minimum, causing the condition of schools across the country to deteriorate. The Truman government is asking for nearly $80 billion in funds for military expansion this year, while the budget request submitted by Truman at the beginning of this year for school education was not enough for three days of military expenditure.

    Another reason for the decline of school education in the United States is that since the Korean War, the Truman government has conscripted hundreds of thousands of young people aged 19 to 26 into military service or sent them to the Korean battlefield to serve as cannon fodder. At the same time, it has also recruited many university teachers and students to abandon their studies and work in military departments.

    War-mongers like Truman, like other militarists, do not value people's education. They hope that the American people will become uncultured, ignorant people, so that they can be arbitrarily driven to serve as cannon fodder in aggressive wars.

    国际简评
    美日反动派的伎俩
    日本人民反对美制单独和约和美日军事协定的声浪，正愈来愈高涨，已使美日反动派恐惧异常。目前，美日反动派正用软硬兼施的伎俩，妄图压制日本人民这种正义的行动。
    最近，吉田政府正在制订所谓“禁止罢工法案”，企图用以镇压日本六百万有组织的劳工反对单独和约、争取独立的罢工运动，吉田政府并在全国各地大肆搜捕日本共产党领袖。与此同时，李奇微总部的劳工科科长艾米斯却以“劝告”的方式，对某些日本工会的领袖说，他们本人以及他们工会的会员，以后最好不要再就单独对日和约及美日军事协定发表抗议或表示反对，企图分化日本劳工阵线。艾米斯一面威胁工会总评议会主席武藤和事务局长高野贵，声言要把他们赶出总评议会；一面又向总评议会的右翼分子进行利诱，要他们在有组织的工人中展开一个亲美运动。
    吉田政府拚命想用镇压的措施来对付反对单独和约的日本人民，这只能表明它做贼心虚，不得人心；而李奇微采取威胁利诱的卑劣手段来分化工人的抗议运动，同样表明了它做贼心虚，狼狈周章。然而，不管美日反动派使用何种手段，都无法阻止日本人民的求取独立和生存的正义斗争。
    美国教育的衰落
    美国的学校教育情况，正在日益恶化。据美国官方宣布，大学注册人数今年比去年锐减二十五万人。美国去年有四百万学龄儿童没有上学。由于缺乏经费，美国有二十五万个教室不够起码的标准，设备环境之恶劣，严重地威胁着儿童的健康。
    美国学校教育的急剧衰落，是由于杜鲁门政府正在把从人民身上搜括来的大批钱财，用于扩军备战。美国自从侵略朝鲜以来，曾经两次增税，现在又在准备实行第三次增税，杜鲁门政府不仅不把这些钱财用于教育事业，反把教育经费削减至最低限度，致使全国学校状况每况愈下。杜鲁门政府要求本年度以将近八百亿美元的巨款供扩军之用，而今年年初杜鲁门提出的预算要求中，作为学校教育的经费，还不够三天军费的开支。
    美国学校教育衰落的另一原因，是自从侵朝战争以来，杜鲁门政府已把数十万十九岁到二十六岁的青年征调服兵役或送到朝鲜战场上充当炮灰。同时，还招雇了许多大学的教员和学生抛开学业，到军事部门工作。
    战争贩子杜鲁门之流，像其他黩武主义者一样，并不重视人民教育，它们希望美国人民都变成没有文化的愚昧无知的人，以供它们任意驱使去作侵略战争的炮灰。
