    The Friendship and Unity of the Two Major Powers, China and the Soviet Union, is the Most Powerful Guarantee of World Peace
    To the Editor:
    The speech by Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg at the National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is of great educational significance and enlightening effect on Sino-Soviet friendship.
    Ehrenburg said, "The friendship between our two peoples has stood the test of many years: we are together when the sun shines in the sky, and we are together when dark clouds fill the sky. We are together in times of trouble and in times of victory." This is such an artistic and vivid description of the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, who account for one-third of humanity.
    He also said, "This is the friendship of two powerful countries. Almost one-third of humanity lives on our land, which is a guarantee of peace." "The hands of those who covet the property of others, no matter how long they are, are too short to do such a thing." We will not forget that the imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang remnants, are daily slandering the Soviet Union and trying to sow discord between the friendly unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Because the friendly unity and consolidated alliance of the Chinese and Soviet peoples will provide a stronger foundation for the unity of the people of the world and accelerate the demise of imperialism.

    中苏两大国的友好团结是世界和平最有力的保证编辑同志：
    苏联作家爱伦堡在中苏友好协会全国代表会议上的讲话，对于中苏友好关系有着重大的教育意义和启发作用。
    爱伦堡说：“我们两国人民之间的友谊却经得起许多年考验：天空出太阳的时候，我们同在一起，黑云密布天空的时候，我们同在一起，在患难中，在胜利中我们都在一起”。这是多么艺术多么形象地说明了占人类三分之一的中苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊。
    他又说：“这是两个强大国家的友谊。全人类几乎有三分之一的人都生活在我们的土地上，这就是和平的保证。”“看到别人的财产就垂涎三尺的人们的手，不管它有多么长，要干这种勾当还是短的。”我们不会忘记，帝国主义及其走狗国民党残余匪帮天天在诽谤苏联，挑拨离间中苏两国人民的友好团结。因为中苏两国人民的友好团结与巩固同盟，就会使全世界人民的团结有了更坚强的基础，而加速了帝国主义的死亡。
