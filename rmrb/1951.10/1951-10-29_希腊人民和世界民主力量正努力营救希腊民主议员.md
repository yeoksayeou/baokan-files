Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 27th: The Greek people and world democratic forces are striving to rescue Greek Left-wing Democratic Union parliamentarians Glezos and Ambatelos, who began hunger strikes on October 8th and 14th in protest against the illegal imprisonment by the Greek royalist fascist government.

Since Glezos, Ambatelos, and other resistance heroes and people's leaders were elected as parliamentarians in the Greek general election on September 9th, the Greek people have actively launched a powerful movement demanding that the government abide by constitutional provisions and restore the freedom of these imprisoned or exiled people's representatives. After Glezos and Ambatelos successively went on hunger strike in protest against the authorities' unconstitutional imprisonment, the Greek people's rescue movement became even more intense. Now, the powerful force of the people has achieved initial victory, forcing the reactionary Greek government to promise to deal with the issue of releasing the people's parliamentarians; and Ambatelos stopped his hunger strike on the 23rd. However, the Greek people's struggle to rescue their true representatives has not stopped as a result, and is continuing to expand.

The Greek people's struggle has received active support from democratic forces around the world. The Soviet Deputy Representative to the United Nations, Tsarapkin, wrote a letter to the President of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Andy Jiang, on the 20th, requesting the United Nations to take emergency measures in the spirit of humanitarian principles, in accordance with the decisions of the Third and Fourth General Assemblies, to rescue Greek democratic parliamentarians such as Glezos who are suffering under Greek political terror. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the Bulgarian National Committee for the Defence of Peace, and the organizations of Bulgarian scientific workers, composers, musicians, and actors, the Central Committee of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, and all the staff of the British "Workers' Daily" editorial department have also lodged strong protests with the Greek government, and requested the United Nations Secretariat to find ways to rescue Greek democratic parliamentarians such as Glezos.

    希腊人民和世界民主力量正努力营救希腊民主议员
    【新华社二十七日讯】雅典消息：希腊人民和世界民主力量正在努力营救因抗议希腊保皇法西斯政府的非法囚禁而在十月八日和十四日开始绝食的希腊左翼民主联盟议员格列索斯和阿姆巴泰洛斯。
    自从格列索斯、阿姆巴泰洛斯及其他抵抗运动英雄和人民领袖在九月九日的希腊大选中当选为议员后，希腊人民积极展开要求政府遵照宪法规定，恢复这些被囚禁或被流放的人民代表的自由的强大运动。格列索斯和阿姆巴泰洛斯因抗议当局违宪囚禁而相继绝食后，希腊人民的营救运动就更加高涨。现在，人民的强大力量已经获得了初步胜利，迫使希腊反动政府答应处理释放人民议员的问题；而阿姆巴泰洛斯也就在二十三日停止绝食。但是，希腊人民为营救他们的真正代表而进行的斗争并没有因此停止，在继续扩大。
    希腊人民的斗争获得了全世界民主力量的积极支援。苏联驻联合国代理代表查拉普金在二十日写信给联合国大会第五届会议主席安迪让，要求联合国根据第三、第四届大会的决定对希腊恐怖政治下的受难者采取人道原则的精神，采取紧急措施，营救格列索斯等希腊民主议员。世界民主青年联盟书记处，保加利亚保卫和平全国委员会和保加利亚科学工作者、作曲家、音乐家、演员的组织，塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党中央委员会和英国“工人日报”编辑部全体工作人员，也都向希腊政府提出强硬抗议，并要求联合国秘书处设法营救格列索斯等希腊民主议员。
