Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 28th: TASS reports: The Egyptian Foreign Minister, Salah al-Din, held a press conference on October 26th. In answering questions, Salah al-Din refuted reports regarding US mediation in the Anglo-Egyptian dispute.

Salah al-Din declared: Egypt's relationship with the Soviet Union is friendly and in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The issue of relations with the Soviet Union will continue to be considered on this basis in the future.

The Foreign Minister pointed out: The time for any negotiations with Britain has passed. The representatives of the four powers (US, Britain, France, and Turkey) have received a clear answer, namely, that as long as British troops are stationed in Egypt, no negotiations will be conducted. Regarding the US policy towards Egypt, Salah al-Din said: "I believe that the United States considers the Egyptian question from one perspective, and that is from the perspective of war, specifically, from the perspective of preparing for a world war." Regarding French policy towards Egypt, he said: "Like Britain, France harbors imperialist conspiracies towards the Middle East. The two countries are both related to the imperialist treaty of 1904 and the policy of destroying North Africa and the Middle East."

Salah al-Din reiterated that as long as British troops do not withdraw from Egypt, and the unification of Egypt and Sudan is not guaranteed, no negotiations or discussions will be held with the United States. He also said: Egypt is prepared to take any steps to achieve this goal. The government and the people together are prepared to endure any sacrifice for this. As for the issue of navigation on the Suez Canal, the Egyptian Foreign Minister said: Egypt holds the right and will resist all British warships and prevent these ships from navigating in the canal.

    埃及外交大臣举行记者招待会
    斥美国“调解”英埃纠纷阴谋
    再度强调英军必须撤离埃及
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社开罗讯：埃及外交大臣赛拉哈丁于十月二十六日举行记者招待会。赛拉哈丁在答复问题时，驳斥关于美国调解英埃纠纷的消息。
    赛拉哈丁声言：埃及对苏联的相互关系是友好的，是符合联合国宪章的条规的，对苏关系的问题将来也将在这个基础上加以考虑。
    外交大臣指出：与英国进行任何谈判的时机已经过去，四国（美英法土）代表已经得到明白的回答，即只要英国军队驻在埃及，决不进行任何谈判。    关于美国对埃政策问题，赛拉哈丁说：“我认为，美国是以一种观点来考虑埃及问题的，而这就是以战争的观点，确切地说，以准备世界战争的观点。”关于法国对埃政策，赛拉哈丁说：“法国和英国一样，对中东抱着帝国主义的阴谋，两国彼此都与一九○四年帝国主义条约以及毁灭北非、中东的政策有关。”
    赛拉哈丁再度强调称：只要英国军队不撤出埃及，埃及与苏丹的统一无保证，决不与美国举行任何谈判和讨论。他又说：埃及已准备采取任何步骤以达到这个目的，政府和人民一起，都已准备为此忍受任何牺牲。至于苏彝士运河上的航行问题，埃及外交大臣说：埃及握有权利，并将抵制一切英国军舰和阻挡这些舰只在运河中通航。
