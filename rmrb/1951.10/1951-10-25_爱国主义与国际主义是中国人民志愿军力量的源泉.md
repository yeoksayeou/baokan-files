    Patriotism and Internationalism are the Source of Strength for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Du Ping, Head of the Delegation of Combat Heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the National Day Observance Ceremony, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    As we commemorate the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war and celebrate the great victories of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies over the past year, we must recall: What strength did the Chinese People's Volunteer Army rely on to defeat the aggressive armies of powerful American imperialism and its accomplices on the Korean battlefield with inferior equipment? What force inspired the Volunteer Army soldiers to endure and overcome all the hardships and difficulties on the Korean battlefield, and to fight bravely and tenaciously against the enemy? This unparalleled great strength is the Volunteer Army soldiers' hatred for American imperialism, their love for their motherland, their deep sympathy for the Korean people, and their sense of responsibility for the cause of world peace, that is, the great spirit of patriotism and internationalism shared by the Volunteer Army soldiers and the people of China and Korea.
    The just action of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country is a concrete manifestation of the close combination of patriotism and internationalism. In the past year, our Volunteer Army fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army. Although it was under extremely difficult circumstances, facing an extremely vicious and brutal enemy, we finally defeated the enemy and achieved a great victory by annihilating more than 380,000 enemy troops. We drove the enemy who had approached the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, liberated the land and people of northern Korea from the enemy's ravages, smashed the American imperialists' aggressive plans, and inspired the people of the world. The achievement of this victory is precisely the result of our troops highly developing the spirit of patriotism and internationalism.
    This kind of patriotic and internationalist thought was already founded when our army began its operation in Korea. While launching the aggressive war against Korea, American imperialism declared the occupation of our territory Taiwan, and later drove its invading troops to advance towards the Yalu River on our border, and sent aircraft to constantly bomb and strafe the cities and villages on our northeastern border. Our troops realized the interdependent relationship between China and Korea, realized that American imperialism's aggression against Korea was aimed at attacking China, and that resisting America and aiding Korea was defending our homes and our country. At the same time, they also realized that the people of China and Korea have a deep friendship. The Korean people had directly participated in and helped the Chinese revolution in the past. When the Chinese revolution achieved victory and the Korean people suffered aggression, it was our duty to aid the Korean people and oppose the common enemy. In the course of this year's war, through the enlightenment and guidance of our troops' political work, the patriotic and internationalist thought of the Volunteer Army troops has become more profound and enhanced.
    The improvement of the Volunteer Army troops' patriotic and internationalist thought relies on mass political work under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This work is to educate the troops with the living facts of the American imperialists' atrocities in Korea, the Korean people's enthusiastic help to the Volunteer Army, the support and love of the people of the motherland for us, and the praise and support of the people all over the world for us, and to raise the various feelings of the troops in real life to the ideological understanding of patriotism and internationalism.
    The war of aggression against Korea by American imperialism has brought profound disasters to the Korean people. Many towns and villages are left with only broken walls, and many lands and gardens have become wilderness and scorched earth. Along the way, there are displaced people, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing from the disaster, and corpses left behind after being bombed and massacred by the enemy are found everywhere. Wherever the American invading army went, hundreds and thousands of patriots were murdered, dozens and hundreds of women were raped, many young people were kidnapped by the enemy, and many babies were abandoned on the roadside. In our troops, we use these unbearable sights to guide everyone to recall the massacres and ravages of the Chinese people by the Japanese fascists in the past, and to recall the crimes of American imperialism in invading China for more than a hundred years. In addition, the Korean people came to our troops one after another to accuse the enemy of their atrocities, and the local cadres also told the troops about the situation in the local area when it was occupied by the enemy, and asked the Volunteer Army to avenge them. New hatred and old hatred are linked together, igniting the anger in the hearts of the Volunteer Army soldiers, arousing the troops' infinite hatred for American imperialism and their high sympathy for the Korean people, and further making the Volunteer Army soldiers realize the close relationship between the liberation cause of the Chinese and Korean people. The soldiers understand: the elders, brothers and sisters of the Korean people are our own elders, brothers and sisters! Their suffering is our own suffering! At the same time, they also understand: if the American aggressors occupy Korea and invade our motherland, will the people of our motherland, our parents and wives suffer the disasters that the Korean people are suffering today!? We cannot tolerate imperialism invading Korea and massacring the Korean people, and we cannot allow the brutal atrocities of imperialism to be repeated on the land of our motherland, so only by winning the victory in the anti-aggression battle in Korea can we defend the Korean people and defend the security of our motherland. Our Volunteer Army soldiers deeply understand this truth.
    We also educated the troops with many moving facts of the Korean people's heroic struggle and the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Although the Korean people have suffered profound disasters, they have not been intimidated by the brutal aggression of American imperialism; they have carried out a resolute and tenacious struggle against the enemy, and have expressed sincere love for the Volunteer Army, and have supported the Volunteer Army in combat with all their strength. They disregarded the enemy's bombing and strafing, repaired bridges and roads, delivered grain and grass, delivered food and guided the way, and took care of the wounded for the People's Army and the Volunteer Army day and night. They even delivered food to our army's positions in the face of enemy fire. Our army often rescues the old, young, women and children of Korea from the artillery fire, and relieves the Korean people from disasters with the victory of the battle. Our troops learned from these facts that they saw with their own eyes, the truth that "workers of the world are one family", deepened the feelings between our army and the Korean people, and strengthened the determination to avenge the Korean people. In our Volunteer Army troops, we also repeatedly emphasized the importance of uniting the Korean people, and put forward the call to "cherish every mountain, every river, every tree and every grass in Korea". Therefore, our troops in Korea not only exemplarily implemented mass discipline, but also used the gap between battles to help the Korean people carry out various labor such as spring plowing, autumn harvest, firewood, fetching water, repairing houses, and digging air-raid shelters. Under the bombing of enemy aircraft, our troops helped the local people rescue houses and property, and bandaged and treated the wounded people. When the local people had no food, our troops would rather eat porridge themselves and save food to help the refugees. Therefore, the Korean people have expressed their heartfelt gratitude to our army countless times, and cherished us as they cherish their own children. Although we do not speak the same language as the Korean people, we have received the same warmth as we do at home. Our troops also protected and cherished the Korean people as they protected and cherished the people of the motherland, and were determined to contribute everything to the anti-aggression cause of the Korean people.
    In the past year, we have continuously carried out education on loving the motherland in the troops. The victories of the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries at home, the achievements of production and construction, and the happy and joyful life of the people have all been quickly transmitted to the front-line troops, so that the combat of the front-line soldiers in Korea and the patriotic movement of the people of the motherland echo each other. The people of the motherland love the Volunteer Army and call the Volunteer Army "the most lovely people". A large number of condolence letters and gifts are continuously sent to the front line, and condolence groups are organized to conduct condolences on the front line in Korea. The Volunteer Army has also been respected and loved by the people everywhere when they returned to China. The supreme honor and meticulous care given to our Volunteer Army by the people of the motherland deeply moved the soldiers of the Volunteer Army. Especially the movement to donate airplanes and artillery at home and to strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has given greater encouragement to the front-line troops. All this has made every one of our soldiers feel more deeply the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, and thus further strengthened their determination to defend the motherland. The soldiers understand: our hard combat on the Korean battlefield is to defend the peaceful construction of the motherland and to defend the happy and joyful life of the people of the motherland; this task is glorious and great. As long as our soldiers think of the motherland, think of the people of the motherland, and think of our great leader Chairman Mao, they immediately increase their infinite strength and improve their determination and belief in overcoming difficulties and defeating the enemy.
    Based on our troops' awareness of firmly defending the motherland and defending the Korean people, we further explained to the troops that the Volunteer Army's fighting in Korea is not only for the security of the motherland and the liberation of the Korean people, but also for the peace of Asia and the world. Therefore, the Volunteer Army is not only supported and supported by the people of China and Korea, but also supported and supported by the people of Asia and the world. Every victory on the Korean battlefield has encouraged the struggle of the people of Asia and the world against aggression and for the defense of peace. The growing strength of the world's peace and democracy camp has greatly enhanced the Volunteer Army's confidence in winning victory. The war that our Volunteer Army is waging in Korea is so closely linked to the struggle of the people of Asia and the world against aggression and for the defense of peace, and thus further enhanced the troops' internationalist thought. The Volunteer Army has become a strong force for defending peace in Asia and the world. This fact not only strengthened our troops' sense of responsibility for the cause of the people of Asia and the world, but also enhanced the troops' national pride. "Win glory for the motherland!"
    "Win glory for Chairman Mao!" has become our troops' combat slogan for annihilating the enemy and completing the task.
    Fighting in Korea, we deeply realized that patriotism and internationalism are closely linked; the power of the complete combination of patriotic thought and internationalist thought is infinite.
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has been fighting bravely under this great spirit of patriotism and internationalism in the past year, and this spirit has been increasingly strengthened and enhanced in the course of the war. Encouraged by this spirit, our troops showed unparalleled courage. In every battle, the soldiers rushed to ask their superiors to give them the most difficult task. When encountering an emergency, the soldiers spared no sacrifice to exchange for the victory of the battle. Therefore, the enemy's so-called solid fortifications could not resist the Volunteer Army soldiers' forward-looking attack; the enemy's so-called "land and air joint offensive" and the bombardment of a large number of artillery shells and bombs could not shake the Volunteer Army soldiers' will to defend their positions. Encouraged by this spirit, our troops overcame all hardships and difficulties. Our soldiers have guarded their positions on high mountains covered with several feet of snow, waded through freezing icy rivers, marched forward in torrential rain at night, and insisted on fighting in a state of hunger and starvation. No difficulty or hardship can hinder the victory of the Volunteer Army. Encouraged by this spirit, our troops also exerted their greatest wisdom and talent, created many ways to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy, and greatly increased their experience in fighting with the enemy, improved their tactical command, and quickly mastered the technology of using new weapons from hard study and hard training. It is precisely because our Volunteer Army has this spirit of patriotism and internationalism that we have become an invincible force. It is precisely because our Volunteer Army has this spirit of patriotism and internationalism that we can highly develop revolutionary heroism in the troops. In the past year, a large number of heroic figures and heroic units have emerged in all units of the Volunteer Army and in various work posts, creating countless touching heroic deeds. The noble qualities of these heroic figures and the brilliant examples they have made have promoted the development of the troops' patriotic and internationalist spirit.
    Patriotism and internationalism are the infinite source of our Volunteer Army's combat effectiveness. Our troops have completely linked loving the motherland with loving the Korean people, and have completely linked resisting American imperialist aggressors in Korea with the cause of defending world peace. Now, the anti-aggression war in Korea is still going on; American imperialism has not expressed its sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue in the Korean armistice negotiations. We must make sufficient preparations for this. We must continue to improve and deepen the troops' patriotic and internationalist thought on the existing basis, strengthen the modernization of our army, and prepare for a long-term struggle with the enemy. We firmly believe that under the highly developed spirit of patriotism and internationalism in our army, the full use of the combat experience our army has gained, and the gradual strengthening and improvement of our army's modern equipment, if the enemy wants to continue its adventurous war of aggression, it will inevitably suffer a more tragic and shameful defeat, and the anti-aggression struggle of the Chinese and Korean people will surely win a glorious and complete victory.

    爱国主义与国际主义是中国人民志愿军力量的源泉
    中国人民志愿军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表团团长  中国人民志愿军政治部副主任  杜平
    当着我们纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年，庆祝一年来中朝人民军队的巨大胜利的时候，我们要回想一下：中国人民志愿军是依靠着什么力量能用劣势的装备在朝鲜战场上打败强大的美帝国主义及其帮凶的侵略军队？是什么力量鼓舞着志愿军战士们在朝鲜战场上忍受和克服一切艰难困苦，英勇顽强地与敌人战斗？这个无可比拟的伟大力量就是志愿军战士们对美帝国主义的痛恨、对自己祖国的热爱、对朝鲜人民深厚的同情、和对全世界和平事业的责任感，就是志愿军战士们和中朝两国军民所共有的爱国主义和国际主义的伟大精神。
    中国人民志愿军抗美援朝保家卫国的正义行动，乃是爱国主义与国际主义密切结合的具体表现。一年来我们志愿军同朝鲜人民军并肩作战，虽然是在极端艰苦困难的情况下，面对着极端凶恶残暴的敌人，但是我们终于战胜了敌人，取得了歼敌三十八万人以上的巨大胜利，把迫近过鸭绿江边的敌人打回到三八线附近，把朝鲜北部的土地和人民从敌人的蹂躏下解放出来，击破了美帝国主义的侵略计划，振奋了全世界的人心。这一胜利的获得，正是我们部队高度发扬了爱国主义与国际主义精神的结果。
    这种爱国主义与国际主义思想，在我军入朝作战开始就已经有了基础。美帝国主义在发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，就宣布占领我国的领土台湾，后来又驱使其侵朝军队向我国的边境鸭绿江进犯，并派飞机不断轰炸和扫射我东北边境的城市和乡村，我们的部队认识了中朝两国唇齿相依的关系，认识了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜就是为了进攻中国，抗美援朝就是保家卫国。同时也认识了中朝两国人民具有深厚的友谊，朝鲜人民过去曾经直接参加和帮助了中国的革命，当中国革命取得胜利，朝鲜人民遭受侵略的时候，中国人民援助朝鲜人民，反对共同的敌人，乃是义不容辞的事业。而在这一年的战争过程中，经过我们部队政治工作的启发和指导，志愿军部队的爱国主义与国际主义思想是更加深刻更加提高了。
    志愿军部队爱国主义与国际主义思想的提高，是依靠在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指导下的群众性的政治工作。这个工作就是把美帝国主义在朝鲜的暴行，朝鲜人民对志愿军的热情帮助，祖国人民对我们的支援和热爱，全世界人民对我们的称赞和支持，这些活生生的事实在部队中进行教育，并把部队在现实生活中的种种感触，提高到爱国主义与国际主义的思想认识上来。
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，给朝鲜人民带来了深重的灾难。许多城镇和乡村只剩下残垣破壁，许多土地和田园变成了荒野焦土，沿途都有流离失所扶老携幼的逃难的人群，到处都发现被敌人轰炸和屠杀后遗留的尸体。凡是美国侵略军到过的地方，就有成百成千的爱国者被杀害，数十数百的妇女被强奸，许多青年被敌人捆走，许多婴儿被丢弃路旁。我们在部队中就以这些目不忍睹的惨状，引导大家回忆过去日本法西斯对中国人民的屠杀和蹂躏，回忆美帝国主义百余年来侵略中国的罪行。加上朝鲜人民纷纷到我们部队控诉敌人的暴行，地方干部也向部队陈述当地被敌人占领时的情况，并要求志愿军为他们报仇雪恨。新仇旧恨联在一起，燃起志愿军战士们心中的怒火，激起了部队对美帝国主义的无限仇恨和对朝鲜人民的高度同情，并使志愿军战士进一步地认识了中朝人民的解放事业密切相联的关系。战士们懂得：朝鲜人民的父老兄弟姊妹，就是我们自己的父老兄弟姊妹！他们的苦难，就是我们自己的苦难！同时也懂得：如果让美国侵略者占领了朝鲜，侵入了我们的祖国，我们祖国的人民，我们的父母妻子将要遭受今天朝鲜人民所遭受的灾难！？我们不能容忍帝国主义侵略朝鲜，屠杀朝鲜人民，不能允许帝国主义残暴兽行在我们祖国的土地上重演，所以只有取得朝鲜反侵略战斗的胜利，才能保卫朝鲜人民，保卫我们祖国的安全。我们志愿军的战士们都深深地体会了这一真理。
    我们又以朝鲜人民英勇斗争和中朝人民战斗友谊的许多动人的事实，教育了部队。朝鲜人民虽然遭受了深重的灾难，但是并没有为美帝国主义的残暴侵略所吓倒；他们和敌人进行了坚决顽强的斗争，而对志愿军则表示了真诚的热爱，并以自己所有的力量支援志愿军作战。他们不顾敌人飞机的轰炸和扫射，不分昼夜地为人民军和志愿军修桥补路，送粮送草，送饭带路，照顾伤员。甚至冒着敌人的炮火把饭送到我军的阵地上。而我军则经常从炮火中拯救朝鲜的老少妇孺，以战斗的胜利解救朝鲜人民于灾难。我们的部队从这些亲眼看到的事实中，认识了“天下劳动人民是一家”的道理，加深了我军和朝鲜人民之间的感情，也增强了为朝鲜人民复仇的决心。我们在志愿军部队中，还再三强调了团结朝鲜人民的重要，提出“爱护朝鲜一山一水一草一木”的号召，因而我们的部队在朝鲜不仅模范地执行了群众纪律，而且利用战斗空隙，帮助朝鲜人民进行春耕、秋收、砍柴、挑水、修房子、挖防空洞等各种劳动。在敌机的轰炸下，我们部队帮助驻地人民抢救房屋和财物，并给负伤的人民包扎和治疗。当着驻地人民没有粮食的时候，我们部队宁肯自己吃稀饭，节省粮食救济难民。因此朝鲜人民曾无数次地表示了他们对我军的衷心的感谢，并像爱护自己的子弟一样爱护我们。我们虽然和朝鲜人民语言不通，但却得到了和在国内一样的温暖。我们的部队也像保卫和爱护祖国人民一样地保卫和爱护着朝鲜人民，并决心为朝鲜人民的反侵略事业贡献自己的一切。
    一年来，我们在部队中不断地进行了热爱祖国的教育。国内抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动的胜利，生产建设的成就，人民的幸福愉快的生活，都迅速地传到了前线部队，使朝鲜前线战士的作战和祖国人民的爱国运动呼应一致。祖国人民热爱志愿军，把志愿军称为“最可爱的人”，大批的慰问信、慰劳品源源不断地送上前线，并组织了慰问团到朝鲜前线进行慰问。志愿军回到国内也到处受到人民的尊敬和爱戴。祖国人民给予我们志愿军这种无上的荣誉和无微不至的关怀，使志愿军的战士们深受感动。特别是在国内展开了捐献飞机大炮的运动，加强了优待烈军属的工作，对前线部队的鼓舞更大。这一切都使我们每一个战士更加深刻地感到祖国的伟大和可爱，因而更加增强了保卫祖国的决心。战士们懂得：我们在朝鲜战场上进行艰苦的作战，就是为保卫祖国的和平建设，保卫祖国人民幸福愉快的生活；这个任务是光荣而伟大的。我们的战士只要一想起祖国，想起祖国的人民，想起我们伟大的领袖毛主席，立刻就增加了无限的力量，提高了克服困难战胜敌人的决心和信念。
    在我们部队坚决保卫祖国保卫朝鲜人民的觉悟基础上，我们又进一步向部队说明：志愿军在朝鲜作战，不仅是为祖国安全与朝鲜人民的解放而战，而且是为亚洲和世界的和平而战。因此志愿军就不仅得到中朝人民的拥护和支持，而且得到全亚洲、全世界人民的拥护和支持。朝鲜战场的每一个胜利，都鼓舞了亚洲世界人民反对侵略保卫和平的斗争。世界和平民主阵营力量的日益发展和壮大，又大大增强了志愿军争取胜利的信心。我们志愿军在朝鲜所进行的战争，就是如此密切地和全亚洲、全世界人民反对侵略保卫和平的斗争联系在一起，因而更加提高了部队的国际主义思想。志愿军已经成为保卫亚洲和世界和平的一支坚强力量，这一事实，不仅增强了我们部队对亚洲和世界人民事业的责任心，也提高了部队的民族自豪感。“为祖国争光！”
    “为毛主席争光！”已成为我们部队歼灭敌人完成任务的战斗号召。
    在朝鲜作战，我们深深体会到：爱国主义与国际主义二者是密切结合的；爱国主义思想和国际主义思想完全结合起来，这个力量是无穷无尽的。
    中国人民志愿军一年来就是在这种爱国主义与国际主义的伟大精神下英勇作战的，而且这种精神在战争过程中日益加强和提高了。在这种精神的鼓舞下，我们的部队表现了无比的勇敢，在每一次战斗中，战士都争先恐后地要求上级把最艰巨的任务交给他们。遇到紧急情况的时候，战士们不惜一切牺牲，来换取战斗的胜利。因而敌人的所谓坚固的防御工事，抵挡不住志愿军战士们勇往直前的进攻；敌人的所谓“陆空联合攻势”，大量的炮弹和炸弹的轰击，动摇不了志愿军战士们坚守阵地的意志。在这种精神的鼓舞下，我们的部队战胜了一切艰苦和困难。我们的战士曾在积雪数尺的高山上固守阵地，曾从寒冷刺骨的冰河中徒涉而过，曾在大雨滂沱的黑夜里兼程前进，曾在忍饥挨饿的情况下坚持战斗。任何的困难和艰苦，也阻碍不了志愿军的胜利。在这种精神的鼓舞下，我们的部队也发挥了最大的智慧和才能，创造了许多克服困难、战胜敌人的办法，并且在和敌人作战中大大增长了经验，提高了战术指挥，从苦学苦练中迅速掌握了使用新式武器的技术。正是由于我们志愿军具有这种爱国主义与国际主义的精神，因而我们就成为一支不可战胜的力量。也正是由于我们志愿军具有这种爱国主义与国际主义的精神，因而我们就能够在部队中高度地发扬革命英雄主义。一年来在志愿军所有部队中，在各种工作岗位上，都涌现出大批的英雄人物和英雄单位，创造了无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹。而这些英雄人物的高贵品质和他们所做出的光辉榜样，又推进了部队的爱国主义与国际主义精神的发展。
    爱国主义与国际主义是我们志愿军战斗力的无穷的源泉。我们的部队已经把热爱祖国和热爱朝鲜人民完全联系在一起了，把在朝鲜抵抗美帝国主义侵略者和保卫世界和平的事业完全联系在一起了。现在，朝鲜的反侵略战争还在继续进行；美帝国主义在朝鲜的停战谈判中，还没有表示它对和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，对此我们必须作足够的准备。我们必须在现有的基础上继续提高和加深部队的爱国主义与国际主义思想，加强我军现代化的建设，准备与敌人作长期的斗争。我们坚信：在我军高度发扬爱国主义与国际主义精神、充分利用我军已经取得的作战经验、并逐渐加强和提高我军的现代化装备之下，如果敌人还要继续进行它的冒险的侵略战争，它必将遭受更惨重更可耻的失败，而中朝人民的反侵略斗争，则必将获得光辉的完满的胜利。
