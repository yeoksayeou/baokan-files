    Rapid Progress in China's Machine Industry
    Capable of Manufacturing Complete Sets of Textile Machinery
    National public and private textile machinery repair and assembly plants have accepted the Central People's Government's order for complete sets of textile machinery for several tens of thousands of spindles for 1952. This large-scale undertaking of manufacturing complete sets of textile machinery is a first in the history of China's machine industry. According to the decision of the National Textile Machinery Conference, national public and private textile machinery repair and assembly plants will, based on the experience of state-owned factories in 1951, adopt a specialized division of labor and massively manufacture complete sets of textile machinery on the existing foundation. The planned production of spindles for 1952 will increase threefold compared to 1951, while looms will increase by 75 percent.
    In the past, China's textile machinery was completely dependent on foreign countries. For more than 30 years, only a few textile machinery factories had attempted to manufacture textile machinery, and their total output was less than one-third of that in 1951. Now, only two years after the establishment of the Central People's Government, China's textile machinery industry is not only capable of manufacturing complete sets of textile machinery, but also, thanks to the specialized division of labor, has simplified product types, adjusted work processes, and partially adopted assembly line production methods, resulting in a significant increase in output. The spindles and looms produced this year can already meet half of the needs of new factories this year. To meet the even greater production tasks for next year, more than 300 public and private textile machinery repair and assembly plants in Shanghai have been organized into seven specialized joint operation organizations. Each joint operation organization determines the tasks of each participating factory based on its equipment and strengths, in order to fully utilize the production capacity of the textile machinery industry.

    我国机器工业突飞猛进
    已可自制全套纺织机械
    全国公私营纺织机械修配厂已接受了中央人民政府一九五二年度若干万锭全套纺织机械的订货任务。这样大批承造全套纺织机械的事，在我国机器工业史上还是第一次。按照全国纺织机械会议的决定，全国公私营纺织机械修配厂将根据一九五一年度国营厂的经验，采取专业分工方式，在已有基础上，大量制造全套的纺织机械。一九五二年度纱锭制造计划产量将比一九五一年度提高三倍，布机则提高百分之七十五。
    我国的纺织机械，过去完全仰给国外。三十多年来，只有个别纺织机械厂曾经试造过纺织机械，其总产量还不到一九五一年度的三分之一。现在，中央人民政府成立不过两年，我国纺织机械工业不但能够制造全套纺织机械，而且由于专业分工的结果，简化了产品种类，调整了工序，部分地采取了流水作业法，产量已大为提高。今年所生产的纱锭和布机已能满足今年新建厂需要的半数。为迎接明年度更大的生产任务，上海已有三百多家公私营纺织机器修配厂，分别组织成七个专业联营组织。每个联营组织并按照参加各厂的设备和特长，确定各厂的任务，以充分发挥纺织机械工业的生产能力。
