Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 5)
    Lü Shuxiang Zhu Dexi

            Section 2 Repetition
    Repetition is also a kind of redundancy. Because this problem is very common and there are many examples, a separate section is used to discuss it.
    Part of the subject repeats with part of the predicate.
    (1) The maturity period of the new variety is half a month earlier than the old variety. (Draft)
    (2) Since the advent of agriculture, the vicious cycle of disasters has been circulating. (Periodical)
    (3) Capital flows to the place with the highest profit rate. (Periodical)
    (1) The maturity period is a period of time, and time will not "mature early." Either remove "maturity period" above, or remove the word "mature" below. (2) It is "disaster" that is "circulating", not "circulation" that is "circulating". It should be said "Since the advent of agriculture, there has been a vicious cycle of disasters." (3) What "flows" is "capital," not "destination." It should be changed to "Capital always flows to..."
    (4) In the past year, women's work has laid a considerable work foundation and gained certain work experience. (Periodical)
    (5) Our job is to rely on these popular activists to break the past "tiger's mouth" concerns and start work. (Periodical)
    (6) Of course, the more important thing about our transformation work is the transformation in terms of content. (Periodical)
    (4) The three "work" are repeated, and the second and third should be deleted. (The word "and" is also unnecessary.) (5) It is "we" who "start work", not "work". The three words "the work" at the beginning should be deleted. (6) The three words "of transformation" at the end of the sentence should be deleted.
    The above are examples of literal repetition. The following are examples of semantic repetition:
    (7) The difference between the two is obviously huge. (Work)
    (8) For example, the description of the battles of Ting Si Bridge and Hesheng Bridge on page 74, and the description of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese invaders on page 182 are described in detail. (Report)
    (9) European and American writing is phonetic, and the distance from the language is limited. (Report)
    (10) Adopt an irresponsible, sloppy, and careless attitude in work style. (Report)
    (7) "Huge" means "a big difference." It should be said, "The difference between the two is obviously big."
    (8) "Saying" is the same as "narrating." It should be changed to "For example, the battles...on page 74 and the massacre...on page 182 are described in detail."
    (9) The meaning of "distance" and "separated" is the same, so only one can be used (if "separated" is used, the word "of" before "distance" should be deleted).
    (10) "Work style" and "attitude" are repeated. In addition, "sloppy," "careless," and "irresponsible" also have the same meaning. It is better to turn this appositive into a predicate and say "The work style is not good, sloppy, careless, and irresponsible."
    Part of the appositive repeats with part of the appositive. First, look at examples of literal repetition:
    (11) In the movie "Female Driver", Feng Xiaomei, a typical intellectual woman, is portrayed for us. (Periodical)
    (12) After I went to middle school and came into contact with some intellectuals and understood what "free love" was, I saw many trading-style love patterns. (Periodical)
    (13) As early as the era of China's brilliant Han Dynasty culture, Dunhuang was a Chinese prefecture. (Periodical)
    (14) Searching for sails with those eyes that look through. (Book)
    (15) China is so vast... In terms of population, it accounts for more than a quarter of all mankind. Except for its agricultural resources, which have relied on "agriculture as the foundation of the country" for thousands of years, are not yet highly developed... (Periodical)
    (11) The word "type" is repeated. The first "type" word should be deleted. Or change "typical" to "character."
    (12) The word "style" is repeated. "Style" should be deleted.
    (13) The word "era" is repeated. The word "China" is repeated. It should be changed to "as early as the Han Dynasty with brilliant culture".
    (14) The word "eye" is repeated. It is enough to say "Searching for sails expectantly".
    (15) Not only are the two "with" and two "agriculture" repeated, but "agricultural resources based on agriculture" is also incomprehensible. It should be said, "The agriculture on which the country relies has not yet..." (It is not known what "agricultural resources" refers to, and "resources" and "development" do not match.)
    The following are examples of semantic repetition:
    (16) This does not mean that a prepared translator will not have problems in the translation process. (Periodical)
    (17) Carrying out full ideological education and ideological mobilization is a prerequisite for doing a good job. (Draft)
    (18) General overview of the production movement. (Draft)
    (19) Actually, this is an overthinking idea. (Periodical)
    (16) "Work" and "process" have no difference in meaning in this sentence. Only one can be used.
    (17) "Prerequisite" and "condition" can only be used one.
    (18) "Overview" means "general." Adding "general" in front makes it redundant. Either change "overview" to "situation" or delete "general."
    (19) "Overthinking" is a classical Chinese word. "Think" means "idea". Moreover, "overthinking" can only be used alone and cannot be used as an attribute. The three words "of idea" should be deleted.
    Part of the two clauses of a compound sentence are repeated.
    (20) After beggars are taken in and reformed, there are basically no more professional beggars. (Periodical)
    (21) When we arrived at Moscow Station that day, the station was crowded with people welcoming us. (Report)
    (22) The primary task is to deepen the movement widely into various grassroots women's organizations on the basis of the existing anti-US aggression and aid-Korea movement. (Periodical)
    (23) When selecting materials, we must pay attention to materials that are short, popular, and related to worker production. (Book)
    (24) Among the comments published in 27 newspapers, there was a general emphasis on comments on the farmer issue. (Report)
    (25) China's cotton textile industry has basically gotten rid of its reliance on foreign cotton and can use domestic cotton to maintain the continued production of the national cotton textile industry to an appropriate extent. (Periodical)
    (26) In order to realize the cotton production increase plan, he mobilized the whole family to select cotton seeds before planting cotton. (Report)
    These seven sentences are all literal repetitions.
    (20) The first "beggars" should be deleted.
    (21) The first "station" should be deleted. "That day" is also redundant.
    (22) "Movement" is repeated. It should be changed to "...deepen the anti-US aggression and aid-Korea movement into various grassroots women's organizations on the existing basis". ("Widely" cannot be used as a verb and is not necessary because "deepening into various grassroots women's organizations" already includes the meaning of "widely.")
    (23) The three words "of materials" at the end of the sentence should be deleted, and the wording should also be changed: "The selected materials should be short, popular, and related to worker production."
    (24) The three words "of comments" at the end of the sentence should be deleted. (The word "了" is also unnecessary because "emphasize" itself contains the meaning of ending. See Section 5 of Lecture 3).
    (25) Wouldn't it be simple to change it to "...using domestic cotton to maintain production"? In addition to the problem of repetition, "and can to an appropriate extent" is also incomprehensible, probably meaning "within a considerable range."
    (26) It has already been specified as "cotton production increase plan," so you only need to say "sowing" and "seed selection" later. There is no need to say "cotton" and "cotton" repeatedly.
    (27) At that time, in my mind, I thought that the countryside was much quieter than the city. (Work)
    (28) We must pay attention to writing in addition to learning theory during our studies. (Periodical)
    These two sentences are examples of semantic repetition.
    (27) The meaning of "in my mind" and "thought" is repeated, and the original sentence has no subject. Deleting "thought" will make it smoother.
    (28) "Must" and "should" are repeated. "Must" should be deleted.
    The two items in parallel are semantically repeated.
    (29) The so-called professional translator is really a not so easy and quite difficult profession. (Periodical)
    (30) It has been proven that the teaching and research group is the most important and first-class organization in the teaching work of universities... (Report)
    (31) Under the joint efforts of our military and civilians to suppress and appease, it has suffered a serious fatal blow. (Periodical)
    (32) I hope that it will not become an inappropriate and outdated thing in a short period of time. (Periodical)
    (33) Since the factory called for creating new production records in January this year, Liu Lifu has not gone to bed before twelve o'clock every night. (Periodical)
    (29) "Not so easy" is the same as "quite difficult."
    (30) "Most important" is the same as "first-class."
    (31) "Serious" to the extreme is "fatal."
    (32) "Inappropriate" is the same as "outdated."
    Only one of the two items in each sentence can be used.
    (34) Take on the responsibilities that they should bear and must bear. (Periodical)
    (35) Facing these acts of aggression by American imperialists and their serious threat to expand the war of aggression to China, the Chinese people cannot and cannot stand idly by. (Periodical)
    "Should bear" and "must bear", "cannot stand idly by" and "cannot stand idly by" have no difference in meaning and do not need to be repeated.
    (36) The poor people who have been trapped on both sides of the Huai River for many years have obtained the conditions and opportunities for a thorough liberation. (Periodical)
    (37) To complete the thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal tasks, we must also carry out unremitting struggles and work. (Periodical)
    (38) A translator should be good at listening to readers' voices and opinions on translations. (Periodical)
    (39) It seems that painters are unwilling to describe the human world and human society. (Report)
    (36) "Conditions" and "opportunities" have the same meaning in this sentence. Only one can be used. ("Trapped" is also incomprehensible. It should be "stuck.")
    (37) "Struggle" and "work" can only be used one.
    (38) "Readers' voices" here are the same as "opinions on translations."
    (39) "Human world" is "human society." These parallel words may have different meanings when taken out separately, but placed in the specific sentences above, it is really impossible to see any difference and cannot be used in parallel.
    The two connected items are repeated.
    (40) Shandong women have generally made preparations ideologically and at work, just waiting to listen to Chairman Mao's call. (Periodical)
    (41) Therefore, in the study of writing, there is no way but to spend more effort. (Report)
    (42) In the past under the reactionary regime, sometimes some exploration work had been done. (Periodical)
    (43) We should have the obligation to convey the true meaning of foreign works to our readers. (Periodical)
    (44) He not only gives everyone an abstract concept of that theme... (Book)
    (40) of "waiting" and "listening",
    (41) of "there is no way but" and "also have to",
    (42) of "sometimes" and "had been",
    (43) of "should" and "have the obligation",
    Only one can be used.
    (44) Either say "not only" or "not just".
    Other.
    (45) The company's equipment includes all kinds of machines and equipment for the knitting industry, but there is not a single sock machine or towel machine. (Report)
    (46) This patriotic action of industrialists and businessmen in various places also plays an active role in guaranteeing the stability of national prices. (Periodical)
    These are all examples of the verb and related object are repeated.
    (45) "Equipment" is repeated. Delete the first "equipment".
    (46) "Consolidate" and "Stability" can only be used one.
    (47) So everyone put forward many questions and started a heated discussion. (Periodical)
    (48) After returning from completing the task, all places celebrated the labor models, attending many meetings all day long. (Periodical)
    (49) A certain unit of the Xiangnan bandit suppression force carried out seven days and nights of fighting and searching the mountains day and night in a bandit suppression operation. (Periodical)
    These are examples of the verb modifier and related object modifier are repeated.

    (48) "All day long" and "many" are repeated.
    Only one can be used.
    (49) Delete "day and night".
    Negligence causes repetition. The repetitions in the following sentences are all caused by the author's carelessness. If they had read it once after writing, they would never have retained them.
    (50) Therefore, there must be careful planning for the production in 1950. (Periodical)
    (51) The newly appointed commander of the Eighth Army of the American invading army, Van Fleet, called this fleeing in panic a retreat "according to plan." (Report)

    (51) The word "却" is repeated. The second one should be deleted.
    (52) The second and third "some" can be deleted. At most, only one can be kept.
    Say a sentence again in a different way. The above sections have cited repetitions of words or phrases. In this section, we will look at some examples of sentence repetition.
    (53) Significant achievements have been made in the past year, and huge effects have been received. (Report)
    (54) A member of the revolutionary camp without organizational reliance is like a person who has lost his political life after being separated from the organization. There is no direction for effort, and the future is bleak. (Letter)
    (55) The sound of enemy planes and the strafing sound, bombing sound, and artillery sound of the massacre of the people could not be heard for a minute. I heard it rumbling every moment. (Report)
    (56) This time, some members of the trade union went to Renmin University of China for a visit, and the result was quite satisfactory, and it had certain gains. (Periodical)

    (58) Our comrades who are often abroad can often understand the original text, but lack vocabulary and often feel that the language is not enough. They cannot find good Chinese to express it and always feel that the language is not rich enough. (Periodical)
    (53) The two sentences "Significant achievements have been made" and "Huge effects have been received" have the same meaning. Only one sentence can be used.
    (54) "Without organizational reliance" means "separated from the organization." Delete the latter.
    (55) "Not for a minute..." and "every moment..." are repeated. Delete the last sentence. (Also, rumbling can only describe the sound of artillery, not the sound of strafing.)
    (56) The last two clauses are repeated. Only one can be used.
    (57) The last clause is repeated with the previous one and should be deleted.
    (58) "Often have...feeling" is repeated with the last clause. Delete the former.
    (59) What we should pay most attention to are those "famous families", "families of scholars for generations", whose ancestors started their careers through imperial examinations, who themselves or their ancestors were officials, the possibility of hiding cultural relics is relatively high, and they will always collect a little bit. This is what we should pay special attention to. (Periodical)
    (60) The Long March overcame all difficulties and achieved the final victory, also because the Red Army was a team closely connected to the masses. Precisely because it relied closely on the masses, the Long March was able to achieve such a brilliant victory. (Periodical)
    (61) The Soviet Union is a country that attaches importance to education, so it will certainly not neglect the education of children. After reading this booklet, you can know that they not only did not neglect the education of children, but also attached great importance to it. (Draft)

    (59) There are two places of repetition. First, "What we should pay most attention to" is repeated with the last clause. Delete the latter. Second, "hiding cultural relics..." is repeated with "always more or less...". It should be changed to "...who have been officials, will always collect a little cultural relics."
    (60) It should be changed to "Because the Red Army was a team closely connected to the masses, it was able to overcome all difficulties and achieve a brilliant victory in the Long March."
    (61) It should be changed to "After reading this booklet, you can know that the Soviet Union is a country that attaches importance to children's education."

    语法、修辞讲话（第五讲）
    吕叔湘  朱德熙
            第二段  重复
    重复也是一种赘余，因为这种毛病很普通，例子很多，所以单用一段来讨论。
    主语的一部分跟谓语的一部分重复。
    （一）新种的成熟期比旧种早熟半个月。（稿）
    （二）自有农业以来，灾荒恶性循环就在循环着。（期）
    （三）资本的去向是往利润率最高的地方流去。（期）（一）成熟期是一段时间，时间不会“早熟”。或者去掉上面的“的成熟期”，或者去掉下面的“熟”字。（二）是“灾荒”在“循环”，不是“循环”在“循环”。该说“自有农业以来，就有了灾荒的恶性循环。”（三）“流”的是“资本”，不是“去向”，应改做“资本总是往……流去”。
    （四）一年来妇女工作已打下了相当的工作基础，和获得了一定的工作经验。（期）
    （五）我们的工作就是依靠着这些众望所归的积极分子，打破了过去那种“老虎口”的顾虑，展开了工作。（期）
    （六）当然，我们的改造工作，更重要的是在于内容方面的改造。（期）（四）三个“工作”重复，第二、第三两个应删。（“和”字也不能要。）（五）“展开了工作”的是“我们”，不是“工作”。头上“的工作”三字应删。（六）句末的“的改造”三字应删。
    以上所举的是字面重复的例子，下面是意思重复的例子：
    （七）两者的差别显然是悬殊的。（作）
    （八）如页七四关于汀泗桥、贺胜桥战斗的叙述，页一八二关于日寇在南京大屠杀的叙述，都说得很仔细。（报）
    （九）欧美的文字是标音的，和语言的距离相隔有限。（报）
    （十）作风上采取不负责的草率马虎态度。（报）（七）“悬殊”就是“很大的差别”。该说“两者的差别显然很大。”（八）“说”等于“叙述”，应该改为“如页七四……的战斗，页一八二……的大屠杀，都叙述得很仔细。”（九）“距离”和“相隔”的意思一样，只能用一个（如果用“相隔”，“距离”前面的“的”字应一并删去）。（十）“作风”与“态度”重复。此外，“草率”“马虎”“不负责”意思也雷同，不如把这个附加语转成谓语，说“作风不好，草率马虎，不负责任。”
    附加语的一部分跟被附加语的一部分重复。先看字面重复的例子：
    （十一）在“女司机”这部电影中，还替我们刻划了冯小妹这样一个知识妇女型的典型。（期）
    （十二）在我上了中学，接触到一些知识分子，懂得什么叫“自由恋爱”以后，却又看到了不少买卖式的恋爱方式。（期）
    （十三）早在中国灿烂的汉代文化的年代，敦煌已是中国的州郡。（期）
    （十四）用那望眼欲穿的眼睛寻觅着船帆。（书）
    （十五）中国这样辽阔广大……以人口论、占全人类四分之一强。除却其数千年来赖以“以农立国”的农业资源尚未高度发展外……。（期）（十一）“型”字重复，应删第一个“型”字。或是把“典型”改“人物”。（十二）“式”字重复，“方式”应删。（十三）“代”字重复“中国”重复，应改做“早在文化灿烂的汉代”。（十四）“眼”字重复。只要说“望眼欲穿地寻觅着船帆”就成了。（十五）不仅两个“以”字，两个“农”字重复，“以农立国的农业资源”也费解，该说“赖以立国的农业尚未……”。（“农业资源”不知指什么，而且“资源”跟“发展”也搭不拢。）
    下面是意义重复的例子：
    （十六）这不是说，有准备的译者在翻译工作过程中就不会发生问题了。（期）
    （十七）进行充分的思想教育和思想发动工作，是作好工作的前提条件。（稿）
    （十八）生产运动的一般概况。（稿）
    （十九）其实这是过虑的想法。（期）（十六）“工作”和“过程”在这句话里意思没有区别，只要用一个就行了。（十七）“前提”和“条件”也只能用一个。（十八）“概况”的“概”就是“一般”的意思，前面再加上“一般”，变得叠床架屋。或者把“概况”改做“情况”，或者删去“一般”。（十九）“过虑”是一个文言词语，“虑”就是“想”。而且，“过虑”只能单独用，不能做附加语。“的想法”三字应删。
    复合句的两个分句的一部分重复。
    （二十）乞丐经过收容改造，职业乞丐基本上已经没有了。（期）

    （二六）他为了实现棉花增产计划，发动全家在种棉以前进行棉花选种。（报）这七句都是字面重复。（二十）第一个“乞丐”应删。（二一）第一个“车站”应删。“那天”也是多余的。（二二）“运动”重复，应改做“……在已有的基础上，将抗美援朝运动深入各种基层妇女组织”。（“广泛”不能做动词用，而且也没有必要，因为“深入各种基层妇女组织”已包含“广泛”的意思。）（二三）句末的“的材料”应删，说法也要变动一下：“选择的材料要短小通俗，与工人生产有关。”（二四）句末的“的评论”三字应删。（“了”字也不能要，因为“侧重”本身含有结束的意思。参看第三讲第五段）。（二五）改为“……使用国棉来维持生产”，岂不简单？这句话除了重复的毛病之外，“而能在适当的程度内”也费解，恐怕是“在相当范围内”的意思。（二六）已经指明是“棉花增产计划”，后面只要说“下种”“选种”就行了，不必一再说“棉”“棉花”。
    （二七）那时候在我的心目中，以为乡下要比都市清静得多。（作）
    （二八）我们必须在学习期间，除学习理论之外，应注意写作。（期）这两句是意思重复的例子。（二七）“心目中”和“以为”意思重复，而且原句没有主语。把“以为”删去，就顺了。（二八）“必须”与“应”重复。“必须”应删。
    并列的两项意思重复。
    （二九）所谓职业翻译工作者实在是一个不太容易而相当困难的职业。（期）

    （三二）希望在短时期内不致成为不合时宜的过了时的东西。（期）
    （三三）自从今年一月厂方号召创造生产新纪录以来，刘立富每天晚上回去没有一次在十二点以前睡的。（期）（二九）“不太容易”等于“相当困难”；（三十）“最重要”等于“第一等”；（三一）“严重”到极端就是“致命”；（三二）“不合时宜”就是“过了时”：每一句的两项之中都只能用一项。（三三）或者说“每天晚上在十二点以后睡”，或是说“没有一天在十二点以前睡”。
    （三四）负担起它们所应该负担、所必须负担的责任。（期）
    （三五）面对着美帝国主义者的这些侵略行动和它企图将侵略战争扩大到中国的严重威胁，中国人民不能也无法袖手旁观。（期）“应该负担”和“必须负担”，“不能袖手旁观”和“无法袖手旁观”，意思没有不同，不必重复。
    （三六）多少年来困扰在淮河两岸的贫苦大众，得到了彻底翻身的条件与机会。（期）
    （三七）完成彻底反帝反封建的任务，还须进行不懈怠的斗争和工作。（期）
    （三八）一个译者要善于倾听读者的呼声和对译作的意见。（期）
    （三九）仿佛画家们都不愿意描写人间和人的社会似的。（报）（三六）“条件”与“机会”在这句话里，意思一样，只能用一个。（“困扰”也费解，该是“困守”。）（三七）“斗争”和“工作”也只能用一个。（三八）“读者的呼声”在这里等于“对译作的意见”。（三九）“人间”就是“人的社会”。这些并列的词语抽出来看，意思容或不同，但是放在上面的特定的句子里，实在看不出有什么不同，不能并用。
    连接的两项重复。
    （四十）山东妇女普遍在思想上、工作上作了准备，只等着听候毛主席召唤。（期）
    （四一）因此在文字上的学习，没有办法，只好还要多破些工夫。（报）

    （四三）应当有义务把外国作品的真正意思传达给我国读者。（期）
    （四四）他不仅只是使大家对那主题有了一种抽象的概念……。（书）（四十）的“等着”与“听候”，（四一）的“只好”与“还要”，（四二）的“有时候”与“也曾”，（四三）的“应当”与“有义务”，都只能用一个。（四四）或者说“不仅”，或者说“不只”。
    其它。
    （四五）公司设备有针织业的各项机器设备，但是没有一台织袜机或毛巾机。（报）
    （四六）各地工商业者这种爱国主义的行动，对巩固全国物价的稳定，亦起着积极的保证作用。（期）这都是动词与相关的宾语重复的例子。（四五）“设备”重复，去第一个“设备”。（四六）“巩固”与“稳定”只能用一个。

    疏忽引起重复。下面这些句子里的重复，都是因作者不小心而产生的。如果写完之后曾经看过一遍，决不会保留下来的。
    （五十）因此便对于一九五○年度的生产便不能不有慎重的计划。（期）
    （五一）新任美国侵略军第八军军长的范佛里特却把这种狼奔鼠窜却叫做是“按照预定计划”的撤退。（报）
    （五二）从解放区外面城市来的一些美术学校的学生、教员、木刻家、漫画家以及一些曾经参加过美联（一九三○年——一九三八年的一个左翼的美术工作者的组织）的一些同志。（期）（五十）“便”字重复，第一个应删。（五一）“却”字重复，第二个应删。（五二）第二个和第三个“一些”都可删，至多只能留一个。
    一句话变样再说一遍。以上各节所举的都是词或短语的重复，这一节里，我们举一些句子重复的例子来看。
    （五三）一年来已经获得了显著的成绩，收到了巨大的效果。（报）
    （五四）革命阵营中的一员没有组织依靠，就如同脱离了组织失去了政治生命的人，没有一个努力的方向，前途是渺茫的。（信）
    （五五）敌人的飞机声和屠杀人民的扫射声，轰炸声以及炮声，没有一分钟听不见的时候，时刻都听见轰隆隆响着。（报）
    （五六）这次工会的一部分会员前往中国人民大学参观，结果相当圆满，是有其一定的收获的。（期）
    （五七）也就是说，我们翻译某种作品的时候，应具有与作者同样的写作水平，同样的理论水平，应与作者站在同样高的水平线上。（期）
