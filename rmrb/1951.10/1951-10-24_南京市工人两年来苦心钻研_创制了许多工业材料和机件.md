    Nanjing Workers Diligently Study for Two Years
    Creating Many Industrial Materials and Components

To the Editors:

    Around the National Day holiday, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Consultative Committee held a city-wide award ceremony and exhibition for factory, mine, and enterprise employees' inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals of the past two years. This summarized their rich achievements in leveraging wisdom and improving production on the production front. The results of the evaluation: a total of sixteen rationalization proposals were awarded, and twenty-two rationalization proposals had a significant impact on production and were commended.

    The vanadium catalyst, jointly created by technician Yu Zuxi and seven workers, which won the first prize this time, is an important raw material in the sulfuric acid industry and was once a "patent secret" of imperialist countries. In order to solve the need for vanadium catalyst, technician Yu Zuxi diligently studied for two years. With the help of workers such as Yu Baofeng, he overcame many major difficulties in industrial manufacturing and finally succeeded completely. This success not only broke the economic blockade of American imperialism, but also made the quality and effectiveness of the vanadium catalyst surpass that of foreign goods.

    Steam turbine blades are important components of turbine machines in power plants across China. In the past, not only did the blades have to be purchased from foreign countries, but the machines also had to be moved abroad for installation. However, after diligent research by workers and professors at the Nanjing University Mechanical Factory, they were finally successfully self-made, with higher quality and lower cost than Siemens products. Therefore, it won the third prize this time.

    Du Renchang, the winner of the third prize, is a worker at the Scientific Instrument Factory. When he started manufacturing riveting machines, he had no blueprints or samples to refer to. It was entirely based on his twenty years of production experience. When he encountered great difficulties, he once doubted whether it would work. At this time, the party branch secretary of the factory told him about party history and encouraged him to persevere. This gave him infinite courage, and as a result, the riveting machine was made, increasing the output of rivets from one every three and a half minutes in the past to more than 150 per minute now, increasing efficiency by 500 times.

    Other industrial materials such as the ammonia catalyst, electron tubes, which won the second prize this time, and the insulated glass, which won the third prize, were previously all sourced from capitalist countries, but now they have been successively manufactured by liberated Chinese workers. This is the glory of the working class in Nanjing and also the glory of the Chinese working class.

### 南京市工人两年来苦心钻研  创制了许多工业材料和机件

    发挥创造能力，建设伟大祖国！
    南京市工人两年来苦心钻研
    创制了许多工业材料和机件编辑同志：
    南京市人民政府与市协商委员会于国庆节前后，举行了一次全市厂、矿、企业职工两年来创造发明与合理化建议的评奖大会和展览会，总结了他们在生产战线上发挥智慧、改进生产的丰富成就。评选结果：得奖者共十六件合理化建议，并有二十二件合理化建议对生产起了较大作用，并获得表扬。
    此次荣获一等奖的余祖熙技师和七个工人合力创制成功的钒触媒剂，是硫酸工业中的重要原料，也是过去帝国主义国家的“专利秘密”。余祖熙技师为了解决钒触媒剂的需要，他苦心钻研了两年，在工人余宝峰等帮助下，克服了许多工业制造上的重大困难，终于全部成功。这次成功，不但打破了美帝国主义的经济封锁，而且使钒触媒剂的品质和效能都超过了外来货。
    汽轮机叶汽是我国各地电厂透平机上的重要机件。过去不仅叶汽要向外国买，而且要把机器搬到外国去装置。但现在经南京大学机械工厂工人和教授苦心钻研的结果，终于自制成功，比西门子的产品质高而成本低。因此，此次获得了三等奖。
    荣获三等奖的杜仁昌，是科学仪器厂的工人。他开始制造铆钉机时，没有任何一种蓝图或样本可以参考，完全是凭着他二十年的生产经验琢磨出来的。当他遇到了很大的困难时，他曾一度怀疑：这样搞是否能行？这时，该厂党的支部书记即给他讲党史，鼓励他坚持到底。这就给了他无限的勇气，结果把铆钉机制成，使铆钉的产量由过去三分半钟制一个，提高到现在每分钟制一百五十多个，提高效率五百倍。
    其他如此次荣获二等奖的氨触媒剂，电子管，以及三等奖的绝热玻璃等，这些工业上的重要材料，以前都来自资本主义国家，但现在都陆续在解放了的中国工人手里制造出来了。这是南京市工人阶级的光荣，也是中国工人阶级的光荣。
