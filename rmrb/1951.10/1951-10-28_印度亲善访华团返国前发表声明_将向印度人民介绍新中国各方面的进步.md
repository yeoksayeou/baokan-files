Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 27th: The Indian Goodwill Delegation to China issued the following statement to the press before leaving Shanghai for Guangzhou on their way home:

    After four weeks of memorable time, we must now bid farewell to the many friends we have made in China. We will return to India, but the pleasant memories of our visit to China will forever linger in our minds. We will never forget the profound friendship and touching hospitality we received throughout our stay. Our deep gratitude to our hosts—the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth—who invited us to participate in the joyous celebrations of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, cannot be fully expressed by ordinary courtesy. They not only spared no effort to make us enjoy all possible comforts, but also gave us every opportunity to visit many aspects of life in New China. We are especially grateful for this opportunity to witness the atmosphere of a great ancient country undergoing a glorious rebirth. The Chinese people possess the rich wisdom and experience accumulated over generations, and are nurtured by the tradition of humanitarian culture for many centuries. Their courage and humanitarian spirit have not lost their brilliance after thousands of years of feudal oppression and imperialist exploitation. Now, they have found a new source of encouragement and vitality from their new government and leader Chairman Mao Zedong, who are wholeheartedly dedicated to the people's cause. The progress they have made in all aspects of national construction in the two years since liberation is a source of inspiration for all Asian countries. Just looking at the various aspects of the great new changes we have witnessed, the land reform that liberated 300 million Chinese peasants from centuries of slavery is an unprecedented revolutionary measure in human history; the new Marriage Law, which guarantees Chinese women freedom and equality, will inevitably have a profound impact on the status of women worldwide, especially Asian women. The patriotic enthusiasm and dedication shown by workers and peasants in carrying out huge production tasks, the vigorous and self-sacrificing spirit of the youth of New China—who strive to create the future prosperity of their country on the basis of voluntary hardship, and shoulder extremely arduous responsibilities with confidence on their young shoulders—all impressed us deeply. The men and women labor heroes and the men and women heroes in the Liberation War gave us a new concept of constructive heroism that combines personal achievements and honors with the broad interests of all the people. The children of New China made us very happy. We saw a new dawn in Chinese history on their bright, smiling, and happy faces. Now we are about to say goodbye to our Chinese friends, not only to the hosts who invited us, but also to the broad masses of the Chinese people. Wherever we go, whether it is Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, or Shenyang, whether it is in villages and factories, universities and general schools, people's courts and cultural palaces, we can encounter the kindness and hospitality of the Chinese people. Even on the streets, we often encounter complete strangers who give us fraternal smiles. Now that we are returning home, the only way we can express our gratitude is to convey to our people the goodwill of the people and leaders of New China, as felt by us as their representatives, and the amazing progress we have seen in all aspects, thereby enhancing and consolidating the glorious friendship between our two countries, which has a history of nearly two thousand years.

    印度亲善访华团返国前发表声明
    将向印度人民介绍新中国各方面的进步
    【新华社上海二十七日电】印度亲善访华团在离上海经广州返国前对新闻界发表声明如下：
    经过四个星期的可纪念的时间以后，我们现在必须和我们在中国结交的许许多多朋友告别了。我们将回印度，但是我们访问中国的愉快的记忆却永远萦回我们的脑际。我们永不能忘记我们在整个逗留期间得到的隆情厚谊和感人的款待。我们对我们的主人——邀请我们参加中华人民共和国建国二周年的愉快庆典的中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、中华全国民主青年联合总会诸人民团体——的深切谢忱，决不是普通客套所能充分表达的，他们不但不辞无限劳苦使我们享受一切可能的舒适，而且给我们一切机会参观新中国生活的许多方面。我们特别感谢这个机会使我们能够幸运地目睹一个伟大的古老的国家在光荣的再生的过程中呈现的气象。中国人民拥有世世代代积累下的丰富智慧和经验，受到许多世纪的人道主义文化的传统的陶冶，他们的勇气和人道精神历千百年的封建压迫和帝国主义剥削而不失其光彩；现在他们已从他们的全心全意致力于人民事业的新政府和领袖毛泽东主席那里发现了新的鼓舞力量和活力的泉源。他们在解放后的两年中在国家建设的一切方面得到的进步是一切亚洲国家的鼓舞力量的泉源。单就我们所目睹的伟大的新变化中的各个方面来说，使三万万中国农民从许多世纪的奴隶制度中解放出来的土地改革，是人类历史上空前未有的革命措施；保证中国妇女享有自由和平等的新婚姻法，对全世界妇女、特别是亚洲妇女的地位必然有深远的影响。工人和农民在执行巨大的生产任务时表现的爱国热情和专心一意的精神，新中国青年的蓬蓬勃勃的朝气和自我牺牲的精神——他们在自愿吃苦的基础上努力缔造他们国家的未来繁荣，满怀信心地用他们的年轻的肩膀肩负着极其艰巨的责任，这一切都给我们很深刻的印象。男女劳动英雄和解放战争中的男女英雄们给了我们一个把个人成就和荣誉与全体人民的广大利益结合起来的建设性的英雄主义的新概念。新中国的儿童使我们感到非常愉快，我们在他们发光的、含笑的、快乐的面孔上看到了中国历史的新曙光。现在我们要向我们的中国朋友告别了，不但要向邀请我们来的主人告别，而且要向广大的中国人民群众告别。我们不管走到那里，北京、天津也好，南京、上海也好，广州、沈阳也好，村庄和工厂也好，大学和一般学校也好，人民法院和文化宫也好，到处都可以遇到中国人民的善意和款待，甚至在街道上也常遇到全然陌生的人对我们报以兄弟般的微笑。现在我们要回国了，我们能够表达谢意的唯一办法就是向我国人民传达作为他们的代表的我们所感受的新中国人民和领袖的善意，以及我们所见到的各方面的惊人进步，从而增进和巩固我们两国之间的有将近两千年历史的光辉友谊。
