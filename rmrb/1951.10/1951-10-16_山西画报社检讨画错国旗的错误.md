Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Shanxi Pictorial's Apology for Incorrectly Drawing the National Flag
    Editor:
    The "Cultural Life Brief Reviews" in the October 8th People's Daily pointed out the error in the propaganda poster "Advancing Victoriously Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao" published in the fortieth issue of "Shanxi Pictorial," where two five-pointed stars were missing from the national flag. This is an unacceptable political error. We fully accept this criticism and offer the following self-criticism:
    At the time, we sent the artwork to the factory, thinking that it could be made into a printing plate simply by photographing and reducing it, and we did not pay attention to the fact that the ink lines still needed to be traced during the plate-making process. At that time, we were also busy rushing out New Year pictures, and we were very careless when tracing the lines. We didn't notice it during printing either. Some comrades only felt that the lines were not beautifully drawn and that the missing two five-pointed stars were not good, but they thought, who doesn't know that the national flag has five stars? So we didn't change it. At the time, we did not realize that removing two stars meant changing the national flag, which is a political error in principle. This is a result of our serious ideological neglect of politics and one-sided emphasis on technology, and it also shows that there is a serious careless style in our work.
    In order to overcome the above errors, we have decided: (1) To continue to carry out discussions within the agency to further examine our ideology and work style, and establish a serious work style responsible to the masses; (2) To strengthen the study of theoretical policies and improve our political consciousness and ideological level; (3) To improve the strict review system before and after publication.
    We have decided to stop distributing this issue of the pictorial. We will reprint the artwork to correct this error. We would like to express our apologies to the original author and the readers.

### 山西画报社检讨画错国旗的错误

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    山西画报社检讨画错国旗的错误编辑同志：
    十月八日人民日报“文化生活简评”指出了第四十期“山西画报”刊登的“在毛主席领导下胜利前进”的宣传画中，在国旗上少画了两个五角星的错误。这是一个不能容许的政治错误。我们完全接受这一批评，并进行如下的检讨：
    当时我们将画稿送到工厂，认为只要照相缩小，即可制版，并未注意在制版过程中还须勾一次墨线。当时又正忙于赶制年画，勾线时非常粗心，印刷时也没有发现。个别同志在出版后仅感到线勾得不美，少了两个五角星，不大好，但是，又以为谁还不知道国旗是五个星？就没有改过来。当时我们并未觉悟到去掉两个星，便是更改了国旗，是政治上的原则错误。这是我们在思想上严重地忽视政治片面强调技术的结果，也说明在我们的工作中严重地存在着粗枝大叶的作风。
    为了克服上述错误，我们决定：（一）在社内继续展开讨论，进一步检查思想与工作作风，树立严肃的对群众负责的工作作风；（二）加强理论政策学习，提高我们的政治觉悟与思想水平；（三）健全出版前后的严格审查制。
    这期画报我们决定停发。重印该稿，以补正这一错误。我们特向原作者和读者致歉意。
