Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: New York News: The New York dockworkers' strike is rapidly expanding. The number of strikers has now increased to 20,000. Almost the entire port of New York is paralyzed. As of the 24th, more than 130 docks had been closed and 104 ships frozen. According to the Associated Press, goods worth tens of millions of dollars on these ships cannot be loaded or unloaded. Thousands of railcars of goods have accumulated on shore, unable to be loaded onto ships. This largest port in the United States "has become a dead port for railway transportation, a road to nowhere."

Now, the strike has spread to other American ports on the Atlantic coast, such as Staten Island, Jersey City, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Chester. Because of the New York port strike, some shipping companies have sailed their ships to the aforementioned ports for loading and unloading. However, they did not achieve their goal, and the dockworkers in these places staged sympathy strikes to support their brothers in New York.

The New York dockworkers' strike is not only supported by dockworkers in other ports, but also by sailors. The president of the National Maritime Union of the CIO has announced that he respects the picket lines set up by the striking workers. "Where there is a picket line, the ship will not move."

Ryan, the chairman of the International Longshoremen's Association of the AFL, who betrayed the interests of the workers and was therefore fiercely resisted by them, shamelessly resorted to violence because he could not force the workers to return to work. With the connivance of the police, he repeatedly sent many hooligan thugs to the docks to beat the striking workers. However, the heroic striking workers resolutely fought back against this atrocity. No matter how the American government, dock owners, and union bosses try their best to sabotage the strike, the fighting spirit of the striking workers has always been very strong. They continue to express their determination to persist in the struggle in order to achieve their legitimate demands. Sampson, a leader of the striking workers, announced on the 24th: "If the leaders of the International Longshoremen's Association do not begin negotiations on a new work contract, the workers will strike for six months."

The New York dockworkers' strike began on October 15th. It has lasted for more than ten days and still cannot be resolved, a situation that makes the U.S. ruling group very panicked. The Associated Press admitted on the 22nd: "The expanding strike will bring to a standstill all military supplies passing through the port of New York to Korea and other military outposts."

    纽约码头工人罢工迅速扩大
    大西洋岸上许多港口码头工人举行了同情罢工
    纽约几乎已成死港，美国统治集团十分恐慌
    【新华社二十六日讯】纽约消息：纽约码头工人的罢工，正在迅速扩大。罢工的人数现在已增至两万人。纽约全港几乎全部陷于瘫痪。到二十四日为止，已有一百三十余处码头被封闭，一百零四艘船只被冻结。据合众社估计，这些船只上有总值共达数千万美元的货物无法起卸。而在岸上积存了数千辆车皮的货物无法装船。这个美国最大的港口，“对于铁路运输说来，已经成为此路不通的死港”。
    现在，罢工已经蔓延到大西洋岸的斯退顿岛、泽西城、波士顿、费城、巴尔的摩、契斯特等其他美国港口。由于纽约港口罢工，有些轮船公司把它们的船只驶往上述港口起卸。然而，他们并没有达到目的，这些地方的码头工人为了声援他们纽约的兄弟，都举行了同情罢工。
    纽约码头工人的罢工不仅受到其他各港码头工人的支持，而且也受到海员的支持，美国产联全国海员工会主席已宣布尊重罢工工人所布设的纠察线。“那里有纠察线，那里的船就不开动”。
    出卖了工人利益因而遭到工人猛烈反抗的劳联国际码头工人联合会主席瑞安，因为无法迫使工人复工，竟无耻地使用暴力。他在警察纵容下，一再派出许多流氓打手到码头上去殴打罢工工人。但是，英勇的罢工工人对这种暴行进行了坚决的还击。不论美国政府、码头资方和工会把头如何千方百计穷凶极恶地破坏罢工，罢工工人的斗志始终十分旺盛。他们继续表示决心坚持斗争，以求达到自己的正当要求。罢工工人的领袖桑浦森在二十四日宣布：“如果国际码头工人联合会领袖不开始缔结新的工作合同的谈判，工人们将罢工六个月。”
    纽约码头工人罢工是十月十五日开始的，现在已延续了十天以上，仍然无法解决，这种情况使美国统治集团感到十分恐慌。美联社二十二日承认：“正在扩展的罢工将使通过纽约港口运往朝鲜及其他军事前哨的全部军事物资陷于停顿。”
