China Textile Workers' Union National Committee Calls on National Cotton Textile Workers to Launch Patriotic Emulation Drive to Fulfill the Task of Increasing Yarn and Cloth Production

The National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union issued a call on the 27th regarding the completion of the winter increase in yarn and cloth production. The full text is as follows:

Comrades Cotton Textile Workers Across the Country:

The Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, in accordance with the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, jointly issued a joint instruction with this union on October 20, stipulating that all public and private cotton textile factories across the country should launch a two-month concentrated effort to increase production starting from November 1. This decision is entirely in line with the interests of the people of the whole country and is also what all of us cotton textile workers hope for. This year, the country has had a bumper harvest of crops, and our farmer brothers and sisters need a large amount of cotton yarn and cloth. Our "most beloved people" - the Chinese People's Volunteers - are valiantly fighting the American aggressors on the Korean front to defend the security of our motherland, and we should give them more powerful support. In order to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people and to enhance the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, the motherland calls on us to increase yarn and cloth production, and we must take on this glorious combat task. The National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union calls on all cotton textile workers to take immediate action and launch a patriotic emulation drive to fulfill or overfulfill the production increase task.

Spinning Workers! Intensify production and ensure the actual production efficiency of processing time!

Opening and Carding Workers! Mix the cotton well, make good cotton laps, slivers and rovings, and ensure the supply of sufficient and qualified semi-finished products!

Spinning Workers! Actively learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, reduce roller waste, and increase output and quality!

Weaving Workers! Improve operating methods, increase production efficiency, reduce fly waste, and ensure the production of more high-quality fabrics!

Maintenance Workers! Strengthen machine maintenance, reduce downtime, and give full play to machine efficiency!

Technicians! Go deep into the workshops, absorb the advanced experience of workers, improve technical guidance and production management, combine theory with practice, and strive to overfulfill the production increase task!

Managers! Improve business management, ensure the supply of raw materials, eliminate the backlog of raw materials and products, and accelerate capital turnover!

Nursery Staff! Take good care of the children so that mothers can concentrate on increasing production!

Cooks! Prepare meals on time and ensure that workers can eat hot soup and food!

Medical Personnel! Genuinely care about the health of workers, step up sanitation work, reduce disease, and increase attendance!

Trade Union Comrades! Go deep into the workshops, study production, promptly summarize advanced experiences, do a good job in propaganda and mobilization, genuinely care about the lives of workers, organize patriotic emulation campaigns more widely, and ensure the completion of the state production tasks!

All Cotton Textile Workers, Technicians, Managers, and Trade Union Comrades! Everything for increasing production, everything for saving, strengthen mutual cooperation and mutual guarantee in production, take good care of machines, and earnestly achieve high output, good quality, raw material saving, and low cost!

All Cotton Textile Workers, Technicians, Managers, and Trade Union Comrades! We have made achievements in the Resist America and Aid Korea movement. Last year, we overfulfilled the task of producing 20-count yarn in a concentrated effort and received awards. Today, the Central People's Government has entrusted this glorious task to us again in the call for a national campaign to increase production and practice economy. We should give full play to the spirit of patriotism, overcome all difficulties, contribute all our strength to production, contribute to Resist America and Aid Korea, and fight to the end for the final victory of Resist America and Aid Korea and the construction of our great motherland!

    中国纺织工会全国委员会号召全国棉纺织工人
    展开爱国主义竞赛完成增产纱布任务
    中国纺织工会全国委员会二十七日发出了关于完成冬季增加纱布生产的号召，全文如下：全国棉纺织工人同志们：
    中央人民政府纺织工业部遵照政务院财政经济委员会的决定，会同本会于十月二十日发出联合指示，规定自十一月一日起全国公私营棉纺织厂一律突击增产两个月。这个决定完全符合全国人民的利益，也是我们全体棉纺织工人所希望的。今年全国农作物丰收，农民兄弟姊妹们需要大量的棉纱和棉布；我们“最可爱的人”——中国人民志愿军，为保卫我们祖国的安全，正在朝鲜前线英勇地打击美国侵略者，我们应给他们更有力的支援。为满足广大人民的需要，为增强抗美援朝力量，祖国号召我们增加纱布生产，我们必须负起这个光荣的战斗任务。中国纺织工会全国委员会号召全体棉纺织工人立即行动起来，为完成或超额完成增产任务，展开爱国主义竞赛。
    运转工人们！加紧生产，保证加工时间的实际生产效率！
    前纺工人们！合好花，做好棉卷、棉条和粗纱，保证供给足够的、合乎规格的半成品！
    细纱工人们！积极学习郝建秀工作法，减少皮辊花，提高产量、质量！
    织布工人们！改良操作方法、提高生产效率，减少回丝，保证生产更多的优良品质的布匹！
    保全工人们！加强机器保全工作，减低停台率，高度发挥机器效能！
    技术人员们！深入车间，吸取工人先进经验，改进技术指导和生产管理，使理论和实践相结合，争取超额完成增产任务！
    管理人员们！改善经营管理，保证原材料的供应，消除原材料、产品的积压，加速资金周转！
    保育人员们！看好孩子，使母亲们集中力量增加生产！
    炊事人员们！按时做好饭，保证工人们能吃到热汤热饭！
    医务人员们！切实关心工人健康，加紧卫生工作，减少疾病，提高出勤率！
    工会工作同志们！深入车间，钻研生产，及时总结先进经验，做好宣传鼓动工作，切实关心工人生活，更广泛地组织爱国主义竞赛，保证完成国家生产任务！
    全体棉纺织工人、技术人员、管理人员、工会工作同志们！一切为了增加生产，一切为了节约，加强生产上的互相配合、互相保证，爱护机器，切实作到产量多、质量好、原料省、成本低！
    全国棉纺织工人、技术人员、管理人员、工会工作同志们！我们在抗美援朝运动中，曾经创造了成绩，去年突击二十支纱超额完成任务，得到了奖励。今天中央人民政府在号召全国增产节约运动中又把这个光荣的任务交给我们，我们应高度发挥爱国主义精神，克服一切困难，将全部力量贡献到生产上去，贡献到抗美援朝上去，为争取抗美援朝的最后胜利，建设我们伟大的祖国奋斗到底！
    一九五一年十月二十七日
