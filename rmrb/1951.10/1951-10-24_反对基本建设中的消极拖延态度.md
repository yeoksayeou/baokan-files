    Opposing Negative Procrastination in Basic Construction

    To start construction rashly without a correct engineering design is an irresponsible act towards the country and the people. After strict criticism, this error has become the "target of public criticism." However, in some areas, some new deviations have recently occurred in basic construction. That is, some engineering designers have adopted a negative and procrastinating attitude towards their work. Some people deliberately prolong the working time. They insist on taking a year to complete a job that can obviously be completed in half a year. Some people deliberately increase the safety factor when designing. They insist on using a plank of one and a half feet when a plank of one foot is obviously enough. The reason they do this is because they are afraid of making mistakes and taking responsibility. They believe that this is meticulous design rather than rushing for quick results; this can guarantee safety and avoid being criticized again. In fact, this is a more serious mistake. If a job that should be completed in half a year is delayed to one year, this will disrupt the planned nature of the country's work; the state has determined the investment, but it cannot achieve the expected results according to the plan, which is the greatest waste. When designing, using more materials and arbitrarily increasing the safety factor will not only waste state resources, but also fail to truly guarantee the safety of buildings. For those who have this kind of thinking, the so-called "going too far is as bad as not going far enough" is the reason.

    It should be pointed out that inexperienced staff are prone to making mistakes; however, as long as they display a high degree of responsibility, work diligently, and work hard, they can completely avoid mistakes or reduce mistakes to a minimum. And after a mistake occurs, as long as they have the courage to correct it, it is possible to avoid repeating the mistake. Of course, not working will not make mistakes, but how can you not work after eating the people's millet? Isn't this an even bigger mistake?

    All departments related to basic construction should conduct full ideological education for their staff in order to prevent and correct this deviation in time. Basic construction is related to the country's century-old plan for industrialization. Every staff member must carry out this work with a thoroughly responsible attitude. It is impossible to do work without being responsible; it is even more wrong to only eat the people's millet without doing things for the people. Neither national discipline nor social opinion allows anyone to do this.

### 反对基本建设中的消极拖延态度

    反对基本建设中的消极拖延态度
    没有正确的工程设计就草率施工，是对国家、对人民不负责任的行为。这种错误经过严格的批判，已经成为“众矢之的”了。但是若干地区在基本建设中，最近又发生了一些新的偏向。这就是有些工程设计人员，对工作采取了消极拖延的态度。有些人故意拖长工作时间，明明是半年就可以完成的工作，偏要拖上一年；有些人在设计时故意加大安全系数，明明用一尺的木板就行了，他偏要用一尺半的。他们所以这样做，是因为怕犯错误，怕负责任。他们认为，这样就是周密设计而不是急于求成了；这样就可以保证安全，而不致再受批评了。其实，这是一种更为严重的错误。应该半年完成的工作，偏要拖到一年，这就破坏了国家工作的计划性；国家已经确定了投资，而不能按计划收到预期的效果，这就是最大的浪费。在设计时，多用材料随意加大安全系数，这不但会浪费国家资财，而且也不能真正保证建筑物的安全，有这种思想的人，所谓“过犹不及”，就是这个道理。
    应该指出：没有经验的工作人员是容易犯错误的；但是，只要发挥高度的责任心，兢兢业业，努力工作，就可以完全避免错误，或把错误减少到最低限度。而在错误发生之后，只要勇于改正，是可能避免重犯错误。当然，不作工作就不会犯错误的，但是，吃了人民的小米，怎么能不作工作呢？这难道不是更大的错误吗？
    有关基本建设的各个部门，都应该对所属工作人员进行充分的思想教育，以便及时防止并纠正这种偏向。基本建设有关国家工业化的百年大计，任何一个工作人员，都必须以彻底负责的态度，来进行这一工作。做工作而又不负责任是不可能的；只吃人民的小米而不给人民作事，更是错误的。国家的纪律和社会舆论，都不允许任何人这样作。
