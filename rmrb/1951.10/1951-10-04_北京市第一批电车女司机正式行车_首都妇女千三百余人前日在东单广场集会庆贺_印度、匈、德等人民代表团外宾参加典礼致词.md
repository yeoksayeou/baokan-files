    The first group of female streetcar drivers in Beijing, Li Yunhua, Luo Fenglin, Wen Huirong, Xia Xueqin, Wang Junzhi, and Qu Guifang officially started driving the day before yesterday. The celebration conference was attended by Wu Ping, Deputy Director of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Shen Zijiu, Director of the Propaganda and Education Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, Zhang Hongshun, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and female worker representatives from the Beijing Water Company and the Automobile Company, as well as foreign guests: István Vás, head of the Hungarian People's Observation Delegation, the People's Observation Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Dieter, and the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China headed by Sendral.

    Hu Quangui, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Beijing Tram Company, gave the opening speech, saying: In just four months, the six female drivers not only learned to drive trams but also learned relevant electrical theory knowledge about trams. This victory once again proves that women in New China can fulfill the same responsibilities as men in the country's construction endeavors.

    Wu Ping, Deputy Director of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Shen Zijiu, Director of the Propaganda and Education Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered speeches successively, unanimously pointing out that in New China, the road to women's liberation is broad, and it is entirely possible for women to master technology. As long as they are willing to work hard, women can do anything. They also encouraged the female drivers to remain humble and continue to learn diligently.

    Subsequently, the foreign guests present delivered speeches to congratulate them. Hanna Sen, a member of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China and President of the All-India Women's Conference, said in her congratulatory speech: This gathering is a testament to the tremendous progress and excellent style of Chinese women. It is with this style that Chinese women have been liberated from the shackles of the past. The path Chinese women are taking today is also the path of Indian women. All women in the world, all progressive women, believe that only when women can fulfill their due responsibilities in the new society is world peace and international security possible. Today's gathering further proves this belief. Your cause and your achievements will not only be written in gold in the history of China but also in the history of the world. I bring the warm congratulations of the Indian people, especially Indian women. I wish you success in the great plans you are preparing to realize.

    István Vás, head of the Hungarian People's Observation Delegation and General Secretary of the Hungarian Democratic Women's Federation, then extended warm greetings to Chinese women on behalf of Hungarian women, saying: All of Hungary is deeply concerned and watching China's growing strength. Just as Chinese women are enthusiastically participating in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, Hungarian women are also fulfilling their responsibilities in the struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. Women in every factory and every village in Hungary know how to support the Korean people's struggle against American aggressors with their work. She presented a banner to the six female tram drivers. She also handed over a gift from Hungarian women to Chinese women to Shen Zijiu, Director of the Propaganda and Education Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation.

    Anna Seghers, a member of the People's Observation Delegation of the German Democratic Republic and a female writer, said in her congratulatory speech: Every one of your victories is a new force for defending world peace. The warmongers are afraid of peace, they hope that we will hate each other so that they can profit from war, but we are closely united in the friendly cooperation to strive for peace. Gabel, a member of the Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, then gave a congratulatory speech, saying: The Chinese people were liberated from the enslavement of imperialism and its running dogs, which was only possible with the heroic participation of Chinese women. Similarly, only through the joint efforts of Chinese and German women can our countries become strong, our common enemy, American imperialism, be defeated, and world peace be ensured.

    Wang Junzhi delivered a reply on behalf of the female drivers, promising to create more wealth for the country and to oppose the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism with better work performance. At the same time, the female drivers and their instructors accepted the gifts from all parties in warm applause.

    After Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, cut the ribbon, representatives of various groups and foreign dignitaries boarded the "National Defense" tram, decorated with flags and ribbons, and driven by female driver Wang Junzhi, it departed from Dongdan Station and was enthusiastically cheered by the masses at each station along the way.
