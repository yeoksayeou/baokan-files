    Yanjing University President Lu Zhiwei and Faculty and Staff
    Send National Day Greetings to Chairman Mao
    Thanking Him for Leading Them to Complete Liberation
    From the Oppression and Control of American Imperialism
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Yanjing University President Lu Zhiwei and all faculty and staff wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on National Day to pay their respects. The original letter is as follows:

    To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    As we joyfully celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and witness the rapid progress of the motherland over the past two years, we sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party for their leadership. Since Yanjing University was converted to public management, completely liberated from the oppression and control of American imperialism, this is the first National Day we have encountered. We assure the Chairman that from now on we will deepen our self-criticism, strengthen patriotic education, and strive to complete the tasks assigned to us by the motherland.

            Respectfully,
            Lu Zhiwei, President of Yanjing University, and all faculty and staff
                                    October 1, 1951
