Cultural News Briefs

	▲ "Northern Sichuan Peasants' News" has correctly implemented the principles of mass participation, popularization, and localization in its newspaper publishing, and has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of peasants in the Northern Sichuan region.

	"Northern Sichuan Peasants' News" was founded on October 1st of last year. In one year, its circulation has reached more than 110,000 copies, ranking first among newspapers in Southwest China.

	The content of each issue of "Northern Sichuan Peasants' News" is closely integrated with current political movements and local central tasks, and it adopts popular language and forms that peasants love to see and hear. Over the past year, it has conveyed the policies and laws of the People's Government; specifically guided rural work at each stage; and reflected the legitimate demands of the peasants. For example, when the masses in Ximei Township, Suining County, struggled against the big local tyrant Li Zhuo, they understood the method of "grasping specific materials to reason and argue according to the law" through reading the newspaper, which led to a complete victory in the struggle. The newspaper's content includes local news, "Words from the Editors," "Major Events in the World," "Common Sense of Production," "Question and Answer," "Readers' Letters," "Dragon Gate Array" (i.e., storytelling), lyrics and ditties, commendations and criticisms, etc. The newspaper is not only a consultant for peasants to learn about current affairs, culture, production knowledge, and carry out the emancipation movement, but also a good publicity material for propaganda workers and various propaganda publications, rooftop broadcasts, etc. The newspaper printed the "Peasants' Three-Character Classic," which was originally published in the newspaper, into a separate edition and distributed one million copies, which has been widely circulated in the countryside.

	"Northern Sichuan Peasants' News" now has more than 1,000 correspondents and 54 peasant correspondent groups. The newspaper receives many manuscripts and letters every day, and every editor and reporter attaches great importance to communication and liaison work.

	▲ The "National Emblem of the People's Republic of China Wall Chart," recently published by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, is printed in colors such as bright red and pure gold; it is 29 inches high and 20 inches wide. The chart has been approved for sale by the General Office of the Central People's Government Committee and is now being distributed by Xinhua Bookstore.

	▲ The Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Pictures of Minority Nationalities held by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government in Beijing closed on the afternoon of the 21st. The exhibits included life models of minority people, residences, clothing, production tools, daily necessities, handicrafts, local products, writing systems, musical instruments, weapons, religious items, and various pictures.锦旗 presented by the people of all ethnic minorities to the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao were also displayed at the meeting.

	The exhibition opened on the 10th of last month and lasted for 41 days, with more than 170,000 visitors.

	▲ East China Normal University officially held its founding ceremony on October 16. The university was formed by merging private schools such as Guanghua University, Great China University, and East Asia College of Physical Education, as well as the Education Department of the public Fudan University, the Zoology and Botany Departments of Tongji University, and the Music Department of the private Shanghai University. East China Normal University now has nine departments, including Chinese, Foreign Languages, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Music, and Mathematics, as well as a Physical Education Specialization.

    ▲“川北农民报”正确地贯彻了群众化、通俗化、地方化的办报方针，受到川北地区广大农民的热烈欢迎。
    “川北农民报”是在去年十月一日创刊，一年中，发行数量已达十一万多份，为西南各报的第一位。
    “川北农民报”每期的内容都密切结合着当前政治运动和当地中心任务，并采用通俗语言和农民喜闻乐见的形式。一年来，它传达了人民政府的政策法令；具体地指导了每一阶段的农村工作；反映了农民的正当要求。如遂宁县西眉乡群众斗争大恶霸李琢之时，因为在读报中懂得了“掌握具体材料斗理斗法”的方法，使斗争完全胜利。报纸内容有各地消息、“编报人的话”、“天下大事”、“生产常识”、“问题解答”、“读者来信”、“龙门阵”（即讲故事）、唱词小调、表扬批评等，报纸不仅是农民学时事、学文化、学生产知识和进行翻身运动的顾问，而且成为各县宣传员和各种宣传刊物、屋顶广播等的良好宣传材料。该报把原来刊出的“农民三字经”印成单行本后，发行了一百万册，在农村中流传很广。
    “川北农民报”现在拥有通讯员一千多人，农民通讯小组五十四个。该报每天收到很多稿件和来信，每一个编辑、记者都很重视通讯联络工作。
