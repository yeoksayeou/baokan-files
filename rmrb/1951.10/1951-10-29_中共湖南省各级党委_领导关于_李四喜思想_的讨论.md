    CCP Hunan Provincial Committees at All Levels
    Lead Discussions on "Li Sixi Thought"

    The discussion on "Li Sixi Thought," initiated by the *New Hunan Daily*, has been widely launched throughout Hunan Province in the past three months. The so-called Li Sixi Thought refers to the complacency and slackness that grew among rural cadres after the completion of land reform. The unfolding of this thought discussion has effectively overcome the relaxing thoughts of rural cadres in various places and promoted various tasks in rural areas. Many county and district leading organs in Hunan Province are now combining it with central work, holding expanded cadre meetings and farmer representative meetings centered on the discussion of "Li Sixi Thought." The leading organs of more than ten counties, including Xiangtan, Hanshou, and Huaihua, have uniformly arranged the work of carrying out the discussion of "Li Sixi Thought," and local newspapers in seven special districts throughout the province have also successively launched discussions on "Li Sixi Thought." As a result, a warm movement of criticism and self-criticism has unfolded among rural cadres throughout the province. For example, at the autumn grain requisition work conference in Wangcheng County, "Li Sixi Thought" was discussed and criticized. Xiong Zhaoting, a cadre from Tuochuan Township in the county, said at the meeting: "I worked as a hired laborer for more than ten years and suffered a lot. As soon as I got land, I became selfish and wanted to go home to produce, not wanting to work. I really forgot my roots. Fortunately, the mirror of 'Li Sixi Thought' shone through me. I guarantee to do a good job in the autumn grain requisition work and resolutely carry the revolution to the end." Luo Weibin, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Chashi Township in Hengyang County, resigned to the district several times after land reform. After participating in the discussion on "Li Sixi Thought," he said: "Now I have found the root of my ideological illness." So he guaranteed to resolutely stick to the end. Under his leadership, the township quickly completed the payment plan for increased production donations in the entire township. In the past, militiamen in Wuli Township, Linxiang County, believed that "the world is at peace" and put away their weapons, but after criticizing "Li Sixi Thought" at the township militia meeting, they resumed the system of night patrols and guarding railways and bridges. Jiang Fulin and other four militiamen in the township discovered and stopped the sabotage activities of illegal landlords in the township in the middle of the night. After discussing "Li Sixi Thought," rural cadres in Fanjiamiao Township in Yiyang County, Gengqing Township in Changsha County, and other places have successively formulated and revised patriotic covenants, established a regular system of studying for two hours every day and checking work and study once every five days, and guaranteed not to slack off, overcome difficulties, and do a good job.

    The criticism of Li Sixi Thought has prompted CCP organizations and people's governments at all levels in the province to attach importance to the ideological education of rural cadres. In addition to organizing discussions on "Li Sixi Thought," the CCP local committees in Changde, Chenxian, Lingling, and other places also focused on checking the ideological situation of rural cadres. In the inspection, many leading cadres also checked many backbone cadres who, due to their achievements in work, the support of the masses, and praise from all parties, also unconsciously developed a tendency of relaxation, arrogance, and neglect of politics, and realized that this ideological tendency has affected the relaxation of political education for cadres and the masses, causing rural cadres and peasants to develop "Li Sixi Thought." After the discussion on "Li Sixi Thought" was launched, the *New Hunan Daily* also promptly studied readers' letters, summarized the discussion situation in stages, and used examples cited in readers' discussions to criticize the erroneous understandings that "Hunan is a new area, the phenomenon of relaxation in rural areas is not serious, and there is no need to organize discussions"; "use the method of pressing tasks to prevent relaxation," and so on. This has made the discussion on "Li Sixi Thought" in various places more in-depth and extensive. Because the essence of this thought is a reflection of the backward thought of rural small producers, Hunan Province is preparing to guide the vast number of peasants in areas where land reform has been completed to participate in this ideological discussion movement in a planned way.

    Editor's note: After the *New Hunan Daily* launched a discussion on Li Sixi Thought, ideas similar to Li Sixi's in some rural cadres in Hunan have been gradually corrected. However, according to the materials we have received, this discussion is not yet deep enough. This is because some local cadres do not fully understand the long-term and arduous nature of educating farmers, and think that "there is no problem" after holding one or two discussion meetings. In some places, although the leading organs have made arrangements, they have not supervised and inspected, so this discussion has not been well launched. Party organizations in these places should pay attention to overcoming certain formalistic shortcomings and deepen the discussion.

### 中共湖南省各级党委  领导关于“李四喜思想”的讨论

    中共湖南省各级党委
    领导关于“李四喜思想”的讨论
    新湖南报发起的关于“李四喜思想”的讨论，在最近三个月来，已在湖南全省范围内普遍展开。所谓李四喜思想就是乡村干部在土地改革完成后滋长着的麻痹松懈思想。展开这一思想的讨论已有效地克服了各地乡村干部的松气思想，推动了农村的各项工作。湖南省许多县、区领导机关现正结合中心工作，召开以讨论“李四喜思想”为中心议题的扩大干部会议和农民代表会议。湘潭、汉寿、怀化等十余个县的领导机关统一布置了开展“李四喜思想”的讨论工作，全省七个专区的地方报纸上也先后展开了“李四喜思想”的讨论。因此，在全省乡村干部中展开了一个热烈的批评和自我批评运动。如望城县在布置秋征工作会议上，讨论和批判了“李四喜思想”，该县沱川乡干部熊兆亭在会上说：“我做了十多年长工，受尽了苦，刚一分田，就自私自利想回家生产，不想工作，真是忘了本。幸亏‘李四喜思想’这面镜子照透了我。我保证搞好秋征工作，坚决革命到底。”衡阳县茶市乡农民协会主席罗为本，土地改革后好几次到区里来辞职，他参加了“李四喜思想”的讨论后说：“这下子才找到了我的思想病根。”于是保证坚决干到底。在他带动下，该乡很快地完成了全乡增产捐献的缴款计划。临湘县五里乡民兵过去认为“天下太平了”，把武器都收藏起来，但经过全乡民兵会议上批判了“李四喜思想”后，又重新恢复了巡夜和守护铁路、桥梁等制度。该乡蒋福林等四个民兵在深夜里发现并制止了该乡不法地主的破坏活动。益阳县樊家庙乡、长沙县耕庆乡等地乡村干部讨论“李四喜思想”后，纷纷订立和修订了爱国公约，建立每天学习两小时和五天检查一次工作、学习的经常制度，并保证不松懈，克服困难，做好工作。
    对李四喜思想的批判，已促使全省中共各级组织和各级人民政府重视乡村干部思想教育问题。中共常德、郴县、零陵等地方委员会除组织“李四喜思想”的讨论外，并有重点地检查了乡村干部思想情况。很多领导干部在检查中也联系检查了许多骨干干部由于工作有成绩，群众拥护，各方好评，亦不自觉的滋长了一种松气、骄气和忽视政治的倾向，并认识到这种思想倾向已影响到放松对干部群众的政治教育，使乡村干部和农民群众滋长“李四喜思想”。新湖南报在“李四喜思想”的讨论展开后，又及时研究了读者来信，分期总结了讨论情况，用读者讨论中所举的实例，批判了“湖南是新区，农村松气现象不严重，不必组织讨论”；“用压任务办法来防止松气”等错误认识。这就使各地关于“李四喜思想”的讨论进行得更加深入和广泛。由于这一思想本质上是农村小生产者落后思想的反映，因此，湖南省各地尚准备有计划地引导在土地改革已经完成的地区的广大农民参加这一思想讨论运动。（根据新华社材料改编）
    编者按：在新湖南报展开对李四喜思想的讨论以后，湖南某些农村干部中类似李四喜的思想已经逐步得到纠正。但是，根据我们收到的材料，这一讨论目前还不够深入，这是因为有些地方的干部对教育农民的长期性和艰苦性认识不足，开过一两次讨论会就以为“没有问题了”。有的地方，领导机关虽作了布置，但未督促检查，因此这一讨论也未能很好地展开。这些地方的党组织应注意克服某些形式主义的缺点，把讨论深入一步。
