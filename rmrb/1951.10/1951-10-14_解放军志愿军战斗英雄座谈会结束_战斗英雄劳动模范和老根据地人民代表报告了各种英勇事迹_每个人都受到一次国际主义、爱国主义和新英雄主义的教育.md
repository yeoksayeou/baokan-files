During this period, the PLA and CPV delegations invited representatives from old revolutionary base areas in the South and North, representatives of industrial labor models, and representatives of water conservancy labor models to give reports.

At the symposium, combat heroes, labor models, and representatives of the people from old revolutionary base areas reported on the heroic deeds and experiences on the front lines of national defense construction, the front lines of the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, the front lines of production and construction, and the early years of persisting in revolutionary struggles.

On the 4th and 11th, the symposium also invited Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, and Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, to give reports.

After summarizing the significant achievements in the great Sino-Korean people's war against American aggression, the suppression of bandits, and the large-scale military and political training movements of the troops over the past year, Deputy Director Xiao said: The large number of heroic figures that have emerged in the past year have taken revolutionary heroism a step forward, creating a noble model of patriotism and internationalism for the people's army.

Deputy Director Xiao then pointed out that the new development in the content of this revolutionary heroism is the combination of revolutionary heroism with patriotism and internationalism, as well as with the improvement of tactics and technology. Therefore, the movement of revolutionary heroism has become one of the important factors guaranteeing the great victory of the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, the suppression of bandits, and military training.
