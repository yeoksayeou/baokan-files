Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th - To prevent the US from repeating and denying violations of the neutral zone agreement, General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, replied on October 7th to Ridgway's reply letter of October 4th. The full text is as follows: To General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces:

    We received your letter of October 4th on October 5th.

    We have given sufficient explanation in our replies of September 11th and October 3rd as to why the Kaesong meeting address should not be changed. In this letter, you cannot provide any new reason why Kaesong is not suitable as a meeting address. It is clear that the request to change the meeting address is untenable. However, your letter repeatedly requests that the meeting address be moved to another area. If this request is not to continue to delay the negotiations, it is to shift the target to evade responsibility for handling a series of provocative incidents in which your side has sabotaged the Kaesong neutral zone agreement. In fact, the events of your side's sabotage of the Kaesong neutral zone agreement will be recorded in historical records and cannot be erased by moving the meeting address. Your side's responsibility for such events cannot be evaded by moving the meeting address.

    Everyone knows that the current issue should be to immediately resume the armistice negotiations and strictly stipulate in the meeting of the delegations of both sides an agreement on the neutralization of the meeting area and security guarantees for the venue, so that such violations of the agreement by your side in the past will not be repeated, especially so that both sides are responsible for this agreement, and it is no longer permissible, as in the past, to only use it to restrain our side while your side can arbitrarily sabotage and deny it on the pretext of not being responsible for the area. For this purpose, and to test once again whether your side still has the sincerity to negotiate, we are willing to make another effort. We now suggest that the neutral scope of the armistice conference area should be expanded to become an elongated area that includes both Kaesong and Munsan, and the venue address should be moved to Panmunjom, and both sides should be responsible for protecting this venue address. At the same time, we suggest that the delegations of both sides should immediately resume talks in Panmunjom, and at the first meeting after the resumption of talks, stipulate the principles on expanding the scope of the neutral zone and guaranteeing the safety of the venue address, and establish an appropriate institution with the participation of both sides to negotiate specific and strict conditions and guarantee their implementation, in order to facilitate the armistice negotiations.

    After your side agrees to our proposal, our liaison officer will discuss with your liaison officer the matters related to the resumption of talks by the delegations of both sides.
    Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
    Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    October 7, 1951

    Attached is the full text of Ridgway's letter of October 4th: To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    I have received your letter of October 3, 1951, in reply to my letter of September 27. I have explained to you my opinion that Kaesong is not suitable as a meeting address. The development of events has proved that equality of action and control is not guaranteed there, nor can it be guaranteed. Only by moving the venue to an area not under the sole control of either party can satisfactory conditions for resuming the armistice negotiations be ensured. Since you have rejected my proposal to meet in Songhyon-ni, I propose that our delegations meet at a location you choose and that is acceptable to me, roughly midway between the front lines of both sides, where the armistice conference can be immediately resumed in accordance with the conditions stated in my letter to you of September 27, 1951.
    General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, U.S. Army
    October 4, 1951

    为使美方不再重犯和抵赖违反中立区协议事件
    金日成彭德怀两将军建议扩大中立区
    建议中立区包括开城和汶山将会场移至板门店双方立即复会
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军于十月七日函复李奇微十月四日的复信，全文如下：联合国军李奇微总司令：
    我们在十月五日收到了你十月四日的来信。
    开城会议地址之没有更换理由，我们在九月十一日和十月三日两次复文中已给了充分的说明，而你在这次来信中，也提不出关于开城不适于作为会议地址的新的理由，可见更换会议地址的要求，已根本不能成立。然而你的来信却再三地要求把会议地址迁到另一个地区去，如果这种要求不是为了继续拖延谈判，就是为了转移目标，以图逃避处理你方破坏开城中立区协议的一连串的挑衅事件的责任。其实，你方破坏开城中立区协议的事件，将载于历史记录中，决不是迁移会议地址所能抹去的，而你方对于这类事件所应负的责任，也不是迁移会议地址所能逃避的。
    人人知道，目前的问题应该是立即恢复停战谈判，并在双方代表团的会议上严格规定关于会议地区中立化及会场安全保障的协议，使过去你方这类违反协议的事件不再重犯，尤其是要使双方对这个协议负责，再不容许像过去那样只用来约束我方而你方可以借口对该地区没有责任，而肆意破坏和抵赖。为此目的，并为再一次考验你方是否尚有和谈诚意起见，我们愿再作一次努力。我们现在向你建议：停战会议地区的中立范围，应该扩大成为将开城和汶山都包含在内的一个长形地区，而将会场地址移至板门店，并由双方负责保护这一会场地址。同时，我们建议：双方代表团应立即在板门店复会，并在复会后的第一次会议上规定关于扩大中立区范围及保障会场地址安全的原则，并成立一个双方参加的适当机构去协商具体而严格的条件，并保证其实施，以利停战谈判的进行。
    在你方同意我们建议后，我方联络官即将与你方联络官洽商双方代表团复会的事宜。朝鲜人民军最高司令官    金日成中国人民志愿军司令员    彭德怀
            一九五一年十月七日
    按李奇微十月四日来信全文如下：朝鲜人民军金日成最高司令官，中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员：
    你们一九五一年十月三日复我九月二十七日函的来信收到了。我已向你们说明我认为开城不适于作为会议地址的意见。事实的发展已经证明，在那里行动与控制的平等没有保证，也不能够获得保证。只有把会址迁到一个不在任何一方单独控制之下的地区去，才能够确保恢复停战谈判的满意条件。既然你们拒绝了我所提在松贤里开会的建议，我提议我们的代表团在一个你们所选择而为我所能接受的大致位于双方战线之间中途的地点会晤，在那里可以按照我一九五一年九月二十七日给你们的信中所述的条件即时恢复停战会议。联合国军总司令美国陆军上将    李奇微一九五一年十月四日
