Lofty Honor
—Visiting People's Representatives from Old Revolutionary Base Areas in Northern China
Xinhua News Agency Reporter: Lei Peng

    The people's representatives from old revolutionary base areas in northern China, invited by the Central People's Government to participate in the National Day celebrations in Beijing, have received the love and respect of the Central People's Government and the people of all circles in Beijing. Their heroic deeds of struggle are being widely circulated.

    Most of the representatives are outstanding figures who persisted in struggle for a long time under the bloody rule of the Chiang bandits and Japanese invaders. Among them is Li Sheng, who is revered by the people of Northeast China as the "Father of the Anti-Japanese United Army." At the time of the "September 18th" Incident, he joined the ranks of liberating the motherland at the advanced age of sixty-five. In 1932, he organized farmers in Heligang, Tangyuan County, Songjiang Province, to carry out an anti-rent struggle, seized weapons from the enemy and puppets, and established the Tangyuan County Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force. In the same year, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and served as a liaison for the former CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee. During the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War in Northeast China, the Anti-Japanese United Army was spread all over southern and northern Manchuria, and transportation and communication were very difficult. Once, he was ordered to contact the First Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army led by General Zhou Baozhong. He started on foot from Harbin and searched arduously for forty days in the Changbai Mountains, amidst icy mountains and snow-covered rocks, dense forests and thickets, before finally finding the First Army's secret camp on the top of the mountain. A large number of cadres dispatched abroad by the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee were all protected and escorted by him. For example, the famous Generals Yang Jingyu, Feng Zhongyun, Li Zhaolin, and Martyr Zhao Yiman were all disguised as his sons and daughters and escorted by him to their work posts. In 1939, he was unfortunately arrested by the Japanese invaders and subjected to brutal torture, but he never uttered a word. During his seven years in prison, he and other arrested Communist Party members continued to fight against the enemy until Shenyang was liberated.

    Cui Yuzhen, a people's representative from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia old revolutionary base area, was originally a worker and participated in the "May 30th" Movement. Later, he went to work in the Jiangxi Central Old Revolutionary Base Area and followed the Red Army on the Long March to northern Shaanxi. He participated in many battles. In 1939, he was wounded in the leg and disabled and recuperated in Yijun County, northern Shaanxi. After the Chiang bandits occupied the county, he continued to bravely persist in the struggle, chopping firewood to maintain his livelihood during the day and carrying out propaganda activities at night to encourage the fighting will of the masses. Although he lost contact with the Party for four years, he still accumulated a full four years of Party membership dues, which he handed over to the Party when the county was liberated again.

    Among the representatives, there are also many revolutionary mothers who not only sacrificed their husbands and children in the long revolutionary struggle, but also bravely persisted in the struggle like men. Among them is Mother Lv, who participated in the early anti-Japanese work in Northeast China, sheltered Martyr Zhao Yiman, and is revered as the "Mother of the Anti-Japanese United Army." There is Meng Yuhe, revered as the "Progressive Elder" in Longsheng County, Suiyuan Province. During the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War, she sheltered more than eighty revolutionary cadres, and her husband was arrested and tortured to death by the enemy for this reason. She often educated her children and grandchildren, saying, "Serving the Eighth Route Army is serving ourselves." Zhang Yamin, a representative from Shan County in the plains, served as the district chief of the guerrilla area of the county in 1938. Within more than a year, she organized a militia district squadron of more than 500 people. She personally led the militia to fight the enemy in Daquanzhuang, the county, captured four Type 38 rifles, and killed or wounded six enemies. She also captured an enemy alive. When the revolution needed it, she sent her son and nephew to join the People's Army.

    The representatives met Chairman Mao in Beijing with boundless joy and excitement, participated in the National Day celebrations and various grand gatherings, and visited the capital's scenic spots and historical sites, factories and farms. They felt excited and proud of the great strength of the great motherland and the tremendous achievements of construction in the past two years. The Beijing History Museum specially painted portraits for many representatives. The representatives were surrounded by welcoming crowds everywhere and received cordial greetings from people from all walks of life. Li Youqiang, a worker from Shijingshan, said to Hu Wenxiu, the mother of the famous heroine Liu Hulan, "You sacrificed your daughter for the revolution, you are our mother." The representatives were very excited and moved, and they said: We will always follow Chairman Mao. (Xinhua News Agency)

    崇高的荣誉
    ——访问北方老根据地人民代表
    新华社记者  雷朋
    应中央人民政府邀请到北京参加国庆典礼的北方老根据地人民代表，受到了中央人民政府和北京各界人民的热爱与尊敬。他们的英勇斗争事迹被到处传诵着。
    代表中大多数是在蒋匪与日寇的血腥统治下长期坚持斗争的优秀人物。其中有被东北人民尊称为“抗日联军父亲”的李升。他在“九一八”事变时，以六十五岁的高龄参加了解放祖国的战斗行列。一九三二年，他在松江省汤原县鹤立岗组织农民进行抗租斗争，收缴了敌伪的武器，建立了汤原县抗日游击队。就在同年，他光荣地参加了中国共产党，并担任了前中共满洲省委会的交通员。在东北抗日游击战争中，抗日联军遍布南北满，交通联系十分困难。有一次他奉命去与周保中将军所领导的抗日联军第一军联系，由哈尔滨步行出发，在冰山雪岩，密林莽丛的长白山中，苦寻了四十天，才在山顶找到了第一军的密营。中共满洲省委往外派遣的大批干部，都由他掩护伴送，如著名的杨靖宇、冯仲云、李兆麟将军和赵一曼烈士，都曾扮装成他的儿子和女儿，由他护送到工作岗位。一九三九年他不幸被日寇逮捕，受尽非刑，但他始终没有讲出一句话。在狱中七年，他与其他被捕的共产党员一起继续与敌人进行斗争，直到沈阳解放。
    陕甘宁老根据地人民代表崔玉振，早先是一个工人，曾参加过“五卅”运动。后来他到了江西中央老根据地工作，又随红军长征到达陕北。他参加过很多次战斗。一九三九年，他腿部受伤残废，在陕北宜君县休养。蒋匪侵占该县后，他仍英勇坚持斗争，白天砍柴维持生活，晚上作宣传活动，鼓舞群众斗争意志。他虽与党失去关系四年，但是仍积存了整整四年的党费，该县再度解放后，即将党费全部交给了党。
    代表中还有不少是在长期的革命斗争中，不仅献出了自己的丈夫与儿女，而且自己也与男子一样英勇坚持斗争的革命母亲。其中有早期参加东北抗日工作，掩护过赵一曼烈士，被尊称为“抗联母亲”的吕老太太。有绥远省龙胜县被尊称为“进步老人”的孟玉河，她在抗日游击战争中，前后曾掩护过革命干部八十多人，她丈夫因此被敌人逮捕，非刑拷打而牺牲。她常常教育她的儿孙说：“为八路军就是为我们自己。”平原单县代表张雅民，一九三八年她曾担任该县游击区的区长，一年多内她组织了有五百余人的民兵区中队。她曾亲自带领民兵，在该县大泉庄与敌人战斗，缴获了三八式枪四支，打死打伤敌人六人，她还活捉了一个敌人。当革命需要的时候，她又送自己的儿子和侄子参加了人民军队。
    代表们怀着无限喜悦和兴奋的心情在北京见到了毛主席，参加了国庆典礼和各种盛大集会，参观了首都的名胜古迹和工厂农场。他们为伟大祖国的强盛和两年来建设的巨大成就，感到兴奋和骄傲。北京历史博物馆专门为许多代表作了画像。代表们到处被欢迎的人群所包围，受到各界人民亲切的慰问。石景山工人李友强对著名的女英雄刘胡兰的母亲胡文秀说：“你对革命献出了你的女儿，你就是我们的母亲。”代表们都非常兴奋和感动，他们说：我们要永远跟着毛主席走。（新华社）
