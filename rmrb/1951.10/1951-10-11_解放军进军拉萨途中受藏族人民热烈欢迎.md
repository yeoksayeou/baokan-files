Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 10th -- The People's Liberation Army's advance troops into Tibet have been warmly welcomed and supported by monks and laypeople of all Tibetan regions on their way to Lhasa. Major towns such as Jiali, Taizhao, Qingli, Mozhugongka, and Deqing organized grand welcome meetings, and representatives of monks and laypeople scrambled to present hadas to the PLA leaders. Among the crowds welcoming the PLA thirty miles east of Jiali were Ren Xiduo De, a fourth-rank secular official dispatched by the Tibetan local government, and Khenpo Sokang, a fourth-rank monk official, among others. At the welcome meeting in Taizhao, local Tibetan men and women performed dances, and soldiers of the fourth generation of the Tibetan army also performed dances. The people of Mozhugongka cleared stones from thirty miles of road for the PLA. The Tibetan people between East and West Dandashan repaired eight bridges over the Aqu River that had been destroyed by torrents a month earlier. The people around each station concentrated a large amount of firewood and grass in advance, and even in areas where firewood and grass were scarce, sufficient firewood and grass were prepared in advance. In addition to concentrating large quantities of wheat flour, zanba, highland barley, peas, ghee, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, and vegetables, the people of Taizhao also transported some grain to Changdu, 120 miles away, to await the PLA. In some places, people even automatically grazed mules and horses for the troops at night, allowing the PLA to get enough rest. The Tibetan people in the Xichang area, who had already been liberated, provided the greatest support to the troops advancing towards Lhasa. They concentrated tens of millions of yaks and horses, overcoming mountains and rain to transport large quantities of firewood, ghee, and horse feed to various material transfer points. The monks and laypeople of Luolongzong and Ziyuan dispatched more than 6,000 yaks and other livestock to participate in transportation last winter and this spring, and were awarded the title of "Model for Supporting the 24 Zong of the Changdu Area." In this support for the army's advance towards Lhasa, they ensured that 700 yaks were dispatched from the entire area every day to participate in transportation, continuously sending large quantities of materials to the PLA advancing towards Lhasa.

    【新华社拉萨十日电】人民解放军入藏先遣部队在向拉萨进军途中，受到各地藏族僧俗人民的热烈欢迎和支援。嘉黎、太昭、青里、墨竹工卡、德庆等较大城镇都组织了盛大的欢迎会，僧俗人民代表争向解放军首长献哈达。在嘉黎以东三十里欢迎的人群中，有西藏地方政府派出的四品俗官任歙多德和四品僧官堪穷索康等多人。在太昭的欢迎会上，当地藏族男女表演了跳舞，藏军第四代本士兵也表演跳舞。墨竹工卡的人民为解放军扫除了三十里路上的碎石。东丹达山、西丹达山之间的藏民，在一月前就修复了阿曲河上被激流所冲毁的八座桥梁。每个驿站周围的人民都把大批柴草先期集中，连柴草缺乏的地区，也预先准备好了充足的柴草。太昭人民除集中了大量的麦面、糌粑、青稞、豌豆、酥油、牛、羊、猪、鸡、青菜外，还把一部分粮食运到距该地一百二十里的常多等候解放军。有的地方的人民更在晚上自动替部队牧放骡马，使解放军得到足够的休息。早已获得解放的西昌地区的藏族人民，更以最大的力量支援部队向拉萨进军。他们集中了千万头牦牛、马匹，翻山越岭，风雨无阻地把大批柴草、酥油、马料运向各个物资转运点。洛隆宗、紫院两地的僧俗人民，去冬今春曾出动六千多头牦牛等牲口参加运输，荣获昌都地区二十四宗支援模范称号，在这次支援大军向拉萨进军中，每天又保证全区出动牦牛七百头参加运输，将大批的物资源源送给向拉萨进军的解放军。
