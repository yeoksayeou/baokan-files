    District and Township Cadres Must Strengthen Their Study of the Marriage Law
    Newspapers and Publications Should Conduct Publicity on the Marriage Law
    To the Editor:
    I have carefully studied the instructions and notices issued by the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Interior, the Supreme People's Court, and the Ministry of Justice regarding the implementation of the Marriage Law, which were recently published in the People's Daily. I have also carefully studied the People's Daily editorial of September 29th and the recent reports in the People's Daily on the implementation of the Marriage Law in various regions, including the problems encountered.

    Judging from the marriage cases that have occurred in various regions, many women have been abused or driven to suicide because district and township cadres have disregarded the interests of the masses and illegally interfered with freedom of marriage. This situation is intolerable! This shows that some cadres still harbor feudal ideas and a serious sense of privilege.

    To correctly implement the Marriage Law, we must first launch a struggle against feudal remnants of thought among cadres. The September 29th People's Daily editorial specifically pointed this out. The Ministry of Interior's "Instruction on Strengthening the Study of the Marriage Law by District and Township (Village) Cadres and Emphasizing the Marriage Registration System" also clearly stated: "Whether district and township (village) cadres can correctly understand the spirit of the Marriage Law is the main key to whether the Marriage Law can be implemented among the broad masses." This is entirely correct. District and township (village) cadres in various regions should especially understand this point well.

    I fully support the specific suggestions put forward in the September 29th People's Daily editorial regarding the widespread and in-depth promotion and implementation of the Marriage Law. I hope that everyone, especially the relevant units in various regions, can conscientiously study the documents related to marriage issues. I especially hope that local newspapers and publications can, in light of local conditions, systematically organize publicity on the Marriage Law.

### 区乡干部必须加强学习婚姻法  报纸刊物应进行婚姻法的宣传

专栏：

    区乡干部必须加强学习婚姻法
    报纸刊物应进行婚姻法的宣传编辑同志：
    我仔细地研读了最近人民日报先后发表的政务院、内务部、最高人民法院、司法部关于贯彻执行婚姻法的指示和通知，又仔细地研读了九月二十九日人民日报的社论和最近人民日报连续登载的各地执行婚姻法的情况、问题等。
    从各地发生的婚姻案件来看，有不少妇女所以被虐杀或被逼自杀，是由于区乡干部漠视群众利益，非法干涉婚姻自由而造成的。这种情形是不能容忍的！这说明某些干部还存在着封建思想和严重的特权思想。
    正确贯彻婚姻法，首先要在干部中展开反对封建残余思想的斗争。九月二十九日人民日报的社论特别指明了这一点。内务部“关于加强区乡（村）干部对婚姻法的学习，重视婚姻登记制度的指示”中也明确地指出：“区乡（村）干部能否正确领会婚姻法的精神是婚姻法能否贯彻到广大群众中去的主要关键”。这是完全正确的。各地的区乡（村）干部特别应当很好地领会这一点。
    我完全拥护九月二十九日人民日报的社论提出的关于普遍和深入地宣传贯彻执行婚姻法的具体意见。希望大家、特别是各地有关单位能认真地学习有关婚姻问题的文件，特别希望各地报纸、刊物能结合当地的情况，有计划地组织关于婚姻法的宣传。读者  林景明
