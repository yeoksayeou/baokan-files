    Our Thoughts and Feelings are Linked Together
    A Letter from Professor Seitz, Representative of the German Cultural Democratic Revival League, to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    Dear and heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

    In these past few days, I have had the opportunity to get to know your great country and people. I have been to villages and cities. I have heard reports about your national construction and visited many exhibitions. These exhibitions have made me aware of the great achievements your country has made in construction, achievements that make it possible for all of your people to improve their lives.

    Striving for peace and guaranteeing peace is a prerequisite. We know that the Anglo-American imperialists occupy land with the aim of plundering wealth. Not only that, but they are also looking for ways to invade other new countries in order to engage in plunder again.

    You have already liberated your own country, and today you have enough strength to help the heroic Korean people in their war for peace and freedom. Your assistance has brought about a decisive change in the Korean War. This change will consolidate peace in Korea and will be beneficial to your people and the people of many other countries in the world.

    Our thoughts and feelings are linked together with your heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In our hearts, we put you first.

    On the second anniversary of the founding of your People's Republic, I had the opportunity to shake hands with Chairman Mao Zedong. Here, I also extend my hand to you and believe that you will return victoriously to your homeland.

    A comrade-in-arms from Germany, striving for peace and freedom, salutes you and embraces you.

    Yours, Gustav Seitz
    October 10, 1951, Beijing

    我们和你们的思想感情是连在一起的
    德国文化民主复兴联盟代表赛兹教授给中国人民志愿军的一封信亲爱和英勇的中国人民志愿军战士们！
    这几天，我能有机会认识你们伟大的祖国和人民。我曾到过农村和城市。我听过关于你们国家建设的报告，参观过许多展览会。这些展览会使我了解到你们的国家在建设上得到了伟大成就，这些成就使你们的全体人民有可能改善自己的生活。
    争取和平和保证和平是一个先决的条件。我们知道，英、美帝国主义者占领土地，目的在于搜括财富。不但如此，他们还要寻找出路去侵略其他新的国家，以便重新从事搜括。
    你们已经解放了自己的国家，今天你们有足够的力量，来援助英勇的朝鲜人民为争取他们的和平与自由的战争。你们的援助使朝鲜战争起了决定性的变化。这种变化将会巩固朝鲜的和平，而且将对于你们的人民和世界上其他许多国家人民都有益处。
    我们和你们英勇的中国人民志愿军的思想和感情是连在一起的。在我们的心里，是把你们放在第一位的。
    在你们的人民共和国第二届国庆节，我曾和毛泽东主席握过手。在这里，我也向你们伸出手来，并且相信，你们将胜利地回到你们的祖国。
    来自争取和平与自由的德意志的一个战友，谨向你们致敬，并拥抱你们。
    你们的古斯塔夫·赛兹
    一九五一年十月十日，北京（这封信的标题是编者加的）（附图片）
