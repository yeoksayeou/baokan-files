    Learning from Comrade Luo Yunzhang's Work Spirit
    To the Editor:
    After reading the article "Only Work is Happiness" published in the "Party Life" column of the People's Daily on September 27th, I was deeply moved. I believe Comrade Luo Yunzhang is China's Pavel Korchagin. He is working selflessly for the cause of the people's liberation. He believes that only work is happiness. This noble quality of a Communist Party member is worthy of everyone's learning. The Soviet Union's Pavel Korchagin once gave me unparalleled strength to overcome difficulties, and now China's Pavel Korchagin—Comrade Luo Yunzhang—has given me even more help. I have copied the article "Only Work is Happiness" into my study manual. I take Luo Yunzhang as a role model to learn from.

    学习罗云章同志工作精神编辑同志：
    读了九月二十七日人民日报“党的生活”栏发表的“只有工作才是快乐”一文，我非常感动。我以为罗云章同志就是中国的保尔·柯察金。他为了人民的解放事业，忘我的工作着。他认为只有工作才是快乐。这种崇高的共产党员的品质，是值得每个人学习的。苏联的保尔·柯察金曾给了我无比的克服困难的力量，现在我国的保尔·柯察金——罗云章同志又给了我更多的帮助。我已把“只有工作才是快乐”一文，抄在我的学习手册上了。我把罗云章作为学习的榜样。
