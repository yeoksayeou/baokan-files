    The Aspirations of the Burmese People
    By Déqìng Gēdū Mài, Head of the Burmese People's Delegation to the National Day Celebrations of the People's Republic of China

    World peace is cherished and desired by the vast majority of people in the world. In the past decade, the cruel war launched by the fascists has been defeated by patriotic people all over the world. In this cruel war, countless innocent old people, children, and even pregnant women were tragically sacrificed; countless properties were destroyed; countless cultures were devastated!

    Currently, the people who have suffered from the scourge of war do not need war and abhor war. It is the broad masses of the people who abhor war, while those who need war are a small group of imperialists and capitalists, namely, the arms dealers and the American imperialists who launched the war of aggression against Korea.

    In our Burma, the American imperialists, under the guise of so-called "economic aid," colluded with the reactionary government and national traitors who do not represent the people, and began to establish military bases. This is not allowed by all the people of Burma.

    Let the Burmese people who do not need war and the people of the world who do not need war, advance hand in hand towards lasting world peace!

    缅甸人民的愿望
    缅甸人民参加中华人民共和国国庆典礼代表团团长  德钦哥都迈
    世界和平是世界上绝大多数人民所爱好与期望的。过去十年中，法西斯所发动的残酷战争，已为全世界爱国的人民打垮了。在这一残酷的战争中，无数无辜的老人、小孩、甚至孕妇，惨遭牺牲；无数的房产都被毁灭；无数的文化被摧残了！
    目前，遭受过战争祸害的人民是不需要战争，厌恶战争的。厌恶战争是广大的人民，而需要战争的却是一小撮帝国主义和资本家，他们就是军火商人和发动侵朝战争的美帝国主义者。
    在我们缅甸，美帝国主义者利用所谓“经济援助”的名义，勾结了不代表人民的反动政府和民族叛徒，开始建立军事基地。这一点是全缅甸人民所不允许的。
    让不需要战争的缅甸人民和不需要战争的世界人民，向着世界的持久和平，携手前进吧！
