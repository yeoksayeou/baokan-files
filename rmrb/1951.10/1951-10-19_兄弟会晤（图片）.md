    Brotherly Meeting Ma Keming and Qin Zheng Collaboration
    (7) "Four hundred spindles!" Yang Shengfu, a cotton planting model worker from Mianchi County, Henan Province, was very surprised to hear that Zhu Jiuneng, a special-class labor model, could watch four hundred spindles. He said, "In our village, even the most skilled hand spinners can only spin four liang (approximately 0.5 lbs) of cotton in a day at most." He said that after returning, he would mobilize the villagers to increase cotton production and hand over the harvested cotton to the worker elder brothers for spinning, which would be faster and better.
    (8) In the visiting ranks, there was a farmer wearing clothes embroidered with the words "Cotton Selling Model," he was Xu Manchang, a cotton selling model worker from Shan County, Henan Province. During the cotton purchasing and storage campaign, he understood that if workers didn't have cotton to spin, it would affect price stability and cause difficulties for the military and civilians across the country to get clothes, so he sold all 168 jin (approximately 185 lbs) of ginned cotton, which he had saved for his wedding, to the state. And he also mobilized cotton farmers in more than a dozen nearby villages to sell more than 8,900 jin (approximately 9,800 lbs) of cotton. This cotton selling model worker was particularly warmly welcomed by the workers.
    (9) When the farmer representatives finished visiting the factory and went to the workers' club to rest, worker labor models Zhou Guixiang, Zhang Cuizhen, and Yu Lishi, etc., hurried to greet them without even changing out of their work clothes. The workers watched the farmer representatives very kindly, listening to their stories of selling cotton. Wang Caifang, a special-class labor model from Mianyang County, Hubei Province, said, "In the past, a dan (approximately 110 lbs) of seed cotton could only be exchanged for two zhang (approximately 20 feet) of cloth, but now it can be exchanged for ten zhang of cloth. We grow more cotton for the people of the motherland to have clothes to wear, and also for ourselves to have clothes to wear."

    兄弟会晤    马克明  秦征合作
    （七）“四百个锭子！”河南渑池县的植棉模范杨生福听说特等劳动模范朱玖能看四百个锭子，十分惊奇。他说：“在我们乡里，手工纺纱的能手一天顶多也不过纺四两。”他表示回去后一定要动员乡亲们增产棉花，把收的棉花交给工人老大哥纺，又快又好。
    （八）在参观行列中，有一个身上穿着绣了“售棉模范”字样衣服的农民，他是河南陕县的售棉模范许满场。他在购棉储棉运动中，懂得了工人没有棉花纺纱，就会影响到物价稳定，使全国军民穿衣发生困难，就把多年积蓄准备结婚用的一百六十八斤皮棉全部卖给国家。并且又动员附近十几个村的棉农售棉八千九百多斤。这位售棉模范特别受到工人们的热烈欢迎。
    （九）当农民代表参观工厂完毕，到工人俱乐部休息时。工人劳动模范周桂香、张翠珍和余李氏等顾不得换下工作服，就赶来招待。工人们很亲切地注视着农民代表们，听他们讲售棉的事迹。湖北省沔阳县特等劳动模范汪才方说：“过去一担籽花只换二丈布，现在能换十丈布。我们多种棉花，就是为了祖国人民有衣穿，同时也为了自己有衣穿。”
