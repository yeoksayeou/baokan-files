The great and vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea movement launched by the Chinese people to oppose American aggression, defend national security, and safeguard world peace has now been going on for a year. Over the past year, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has achieved great victories. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, fighting side by side, have shattered the American plot to destroy Korea and invade China in a swift war. They have inflicted severe losses on the enemy's manpower and pushed the battle line to the vicinity of the "38th parallel," where the enemy launched the war of aggression, forcing the enemy to accept the Kaesong armistice negotiations. Domestically, the Chinese people, in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, have fully supported the front lines and intensified national defense, as well as political, economic, and cultural construction, achieving equally brilliant successes. Resisting America and aiding Korea has become the driving force for all work, giving a new look to all aspects of our work.

(II)

The Chinese people are extremely indignant and deeply concerned about the American-launched war of aggression against Korea. The United States provoked the war in Korea on June 25th last year. On June 28th, only three days after the Korean War broke out, Chairman Mao pointed out at the eighth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee that the sympathy of all the Chinese people would be on the side of the invaded. Chairman Mao also called on "the people of the whole country and the world to unite, make full preparations, and defeat any provocation by American imperialism." The movement to protest American aggression against Korea immediately and widely unfolded throughout the country. The U.S. government ignored the just condemnation of the Chinese people at the time, believing in its invincible myth. In fact, in the early stages of the Korean War, the United States suffered serious defeats, retreating to the Daegu-Busan line. However, it not only showed no repentance, but also launched a large-scale landing at Incheon in September of last year, further expanding the war of aggression against Korea. On September 30th of last year, Premier Zhou Enlai issued a stern warning to the United States, stating that "the Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they allow the imperialists to肆行 aggress against their neighbors and ignore it." The United States still ignored this serious warning from the Chinese people and blatantly crossed the "38th parallel" in early October of last year, advancing rapidly towards the northeastern border of our country. Its aggressive spearhead had reached or approached the Yalu River in Chusan and Hyesan, etc. At the same time, American planes constantly violated our country's northeastern airspace, strafing and bombing our northeastern border areas, and American warships constantly shelled our merchant ships, destroying the lives and property of our people. Under circumstances where our people could no longer tolerate it, they stepped forward and decided to launch the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. To realize the will of the Chinese people, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea to fight in late October of last year.

For American imperialism, which is strong in appearance but weak in reality, a blitzkrieg of aggression is the most cost-effective deal. The United States originally attempted to use its lackey, Syngman Rhee, to launch a sudden offensive and quickly destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This plan was crushed in three days of fighting. The American army, navy, and air force successively joined the battle within a week, but they were also quickly defeated under the blows of the Korean People's Army. This defeat was very unexpected for the American ruling clique. General Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had to admit in his testimony before the U.S. Senate on May 22nd of this year: "No one thought that North Korea would be as strong as it later proved to be. Based on our intelligence, we underestimated their numbers, their equipment, and their combat capabilities." In order to make a desperate gamble, the United States scraped together all the military forces it could use in the Far East in September of last year and launched a large-scale landing at Incheon, launching the so-called "general offensive to end the Korean War." At that time, due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and us, the Korean war situation once presented a serious situation. However, after the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, this situation quickly changed. The first and second campaigns, which began in late October of last year, basically shattered the enemy's arrogant Christmas general offensive; the third campaign in early January of this year drove the enemy back to the south of the "38th parallel"; the American plan to destroy Korea in a swift war completely failed. Later, the enemy attempted to drag down the Chinese and Korean people's forces with the so-called "kill and wound war" and "war of attrition" "new tactics." However, the enemy's new tactics failed again. In the three months from the end of October last year to the end of January this year, when the enemy adopted aggressive tactics, the enemy suffered more than 60,000 casualties; and in the four months from the end of January to the end of May this year, when the enemy adopted attrition tactics, the enemy suffered more than 120,000 casualties, twice as many as in the previous period. After various tactics proved to be completely ineffective, the American aggressor in Korea, MacArthur, was dismissed in disgrace on April 11th.

Since then, the Korean War has been fluctuating around the "38th parallel." The Chinese and Korean people's forces have adopted the correct combat policy of annihilating the enemy's effective strength, firmly grasped the initiative in the war, advancing can attack, retreat can defend; the enemy is caught off guard, passively coping, attacking and defending are extremely difficult. American war monger Albert Wedemeyer told the truth when he testified before the U.S. Senate on June 12th of this year, saying: "The Korean War is a bottomless pit"; this "bottomless pit" has consumed huge human resources of the United States. From the time the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea to fight until September 5th of this year, the Chinese and Korean people's forces have annihilated a total of 322,000 American and Rhee bandits, including more than 140,000 American, British, French, and Turkish troops, among which the most important were the American troops. The number of American casualties exceeded the total number of American casualties in the first year of World War II, from December 1941 to December 1942, which was more than 58,000. More than 140,000 people is equivalent to the strength of more than seven regular divisions of the American army (calculated at 18,000 people per division), far exceeding one-third of the existing eighteen regular divisions of the United States. One of the American reactionary leaders, Herbert Hoover, even said in his speech on American foreign policy on December 20th of last year: "The United Nations has been defeated by the 'aggression' (?) of Communist China in Korea, and there is no army in the world that can defeat the Chinese now." Some people in the American ruling clique have completely lost confidence in the war of aggression against Korea, which is why the United States accepted the Korean armistice negotiations; other people in the American ruling clique insist on refusing to wash their hands in Korea, which is why the United States has tried every possible means to sabotage the Kaesong armistice negotiations. So, what should we do? Is it to make a further desperate gamble and immediately expand the war of aggression? Or to temporarily drag on in Korea in order to step up war preparations and wait for an opportunity to expand the war of aggression? This is the focus of the dispute between MacArthur and Truman, Marshall, etc. This dispute has no essential difference, only differences in the methods and steps of aggression.

However, in any case, the American attempt to destroy Korea and thus attack our mainland has been decisively defeated. The United States stole the signboard of the "United Nations," obtained so-called "moral" or "material," "strength" assistance from "fifty-three" countries, and launched a large-scale offensive against Korea and China. It was defeated by a volunteer force dispatched by the Chinese people and the young Korean People's Army. Isn't this the most eloquent proof that the United States is a paper tiger? Isn't this the most powerful proof that the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union far exceeds the strength of the imperialist camp headed by the United States? The victory of our people in resisting America and aiding Korea not only directly defended the security of our great motherland and aided the just struggle of the Korean people, but also inspired the determination and confidence of the people of the world, especially the people of the East, to strive for peace and oppose aggression, and shaken the entire evil plan of the United States to invade the world. Over the past year, our people have proved to the whole world with their great and just struggle, and continue to prove an irrefutable truth: our young People's Republic of China is powerful, invincible, and unconquerable.

(III)

Another great victory that our people have achieved in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement over the past year is the new upsurge of patriotism throughout the country. Our people launched the Resist America, Aid Korea movement based on patriotism; and in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, our people received universal and in-depth patriotic education, which further enhanced their political awareness. Over the past year, 80% of our people have received patriotic education, basically eliminating the reactionary thoughts of "pro-American" and "worshiping America" and the erroneous psychology of "fearing America" left over by American imperialism's military, political, economic, and cultural aggression, appeasement, deception against China for more than a hundred years. They have established a psychology of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism; greatly enhanced national self-esteem and self-confidence; and strengthened the determination to fight with one heart and defeat American aggression. This is the great victory of our people's Resist America, Aid Korea movement on the ideological front. On this ideological basis, a material force to completely defeat American aggression has been generated.

The new upsurge of patriotism among our people is concentrated and prominently manifested in the movement to formulate and implement patriotic pacts throughout the country. Patriotic pacts are the great creation of our people in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement; it combines the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of people with practical work, and fixes it in the form of treaties; it points out specific goals for the people to strive for, and enables the people's daily patriotic actions to be followed, so it powerfully promotes various practical works. Now, formulating and implementing patriotic pacts has become a mass movement among people from all walks of life and institutions, groups, factories, and schools across the country. In cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, 80% of the population has formulated patriotic pacts. Eighty percent of rural and urban residents in Hebei Province have formulated patriotic pacts. According to incomplete statistics from 60 counties in 9 special districts of the province, 13,096 villages out of 15,968 villages have formulated patriotic pacts, accounting for more than 82% of the total number of villages. People from all walks of life and workers in various positions, with patriotic pacts as the criterion, unite as one and strive to consolidate national defense and enhance the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, achieving amazing results.

Another great action by our people to support the front lines and consolidate national defense is the nationwide donation of aircraft and cannons movement that began on June 1st. This movement has spread to all regions and strata of the country. This movement is combined with increased production, so it has powerfully promoted our country's production and construction. As of September 25th, the nation had donated 2,481 aircraft. As of September 25th, 997 billion yuan had been deposited in donations. To build a solid national defense, young Chinese intellectuals responded to the call of the motherland and enthusiastically applied for various military cadre schools. The number of applicants in the two applications reached more than 580,000.

Our people deeply know that fully supporting the Korean front line is the most important task at present. After the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea to fight, a widespread movement to support the Volunteer Army was immediately launched throughout the country. Volunteer railway workers, volunteer automobile drivers, volunteer medical teams, epidemic prevention teams, etc., went to Korea one after another to support the Chinese and Korean people's armies in combat. According to extremely incomplete statistics, more than 50 volunteer medical teams across the country have gone to Korea.

Our people enthusiastically responded to the call of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea and launched a large-scale movement to raise consolation money and relief supplies. As of May 30th of this year, the people across the country had donated more than 118.6 billion yuan, donated more than 770,000 consolation bags, and donated more than 1.26 million consolation items to comfort the Chinese and Korean people's forces and relieve Korean disaster victims.

Our people paid special attention to the families of the Volunteer Army soldiers who were fighting hard on the Korean front line and carried out large-scale preferential treatment work for the families of martyrs and soldiers. The people of Chahar Province regarded preferential treatment as a major political task for consolidating national defense and consolidating the troops, "cultivating the land well for every family" of the families of martyrs and soldiers in rural areas, and "every household has a job" for the families of martyrs and soldiers in cities, ensuring that the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers are not lower than the living standards of the local masses.

In order to convey the situation and experience of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea between the front and rear, to encourage the determination and confidence of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army at the front and the people of the whole country, the Chinese people sent a delegation to the Korean front in March to pay tribute to the People's Volunteer Army with the highest respect and heartfelt thanks. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army also sent representatives back to the country to report on resisting America and aiding Korea to the people of the whole country. This work has achieved great results in patriotic education.

(IV)

Resisting America and aiding Korea is a constantly functioning driving force for all work. This truth has been proven by various great practical movements in our country. In the past year, land reform has been completed in areas with 150 million agricultural population in our country, and about 90 million poor farmers have obtained 12 million hectares of land from the landlords. The momentum and speed of this is unprecedented in our country's history. Our emancipated peasants combined their land demands with patriotism, and took the elimination of the landlord class as a powerful step to defeat American aggression. Therefore, they shouted the slogan "The front fights American heads, the rear digs American roots," giving a devastating blow to the last pillar of American imperialism in China.

Our people know very well that "fortresses are most easily broken from within," so, in order to consolidate the fruits of victory and eliminate the running dogs and minions of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, we have launched a vigorous movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries throughout the country. More than one million bandits have been wiped out, and the counter-revolutionaries lurking in various places have been basically eliminated. This has further consolidated the revolutionary regime and democratic order, and the enemy's lurking forces have been dealt a devastating blow.

In the Resist America, Aid Korea and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, our patriotic Christians and Catholics, under the banner of patriotism, launched the "Three-Self Reform" movement throughout the country, accusing and expelling the imperialist elements hiding in Christianity and Catholicism. The struggle against imperialist elements such as Liberi has formed an unprecedented mass movement in religious circles across the country. Now, 277,800 Christians and 180,000 Catholics across the country have signed the reform declaration. This patriotic action of our religious circles has completely shattered the shameless conspiracy of American imperialism to use religion against the Chinese people.

The Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the past year has powerfully promoted the labor emulation of the working class and the bumper harvest emulation movement in agriculture. Because this competition movement is carried out on the basis of high patriotism, its scale and depth are greater than in the past. The workers put forward the slogan "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the gun, producing one more product is to enhance the strength of killing the enemy by one point, and reducing one defective product is to eliminate one enemy." Amazing production records continue to emerge. This year, the working class in Northeast China, in response to the call of Chairman Gao Gang, launched an increase in production and savings campaign to create 10 million tons of grain wealth in excess value. This fact concentrates on showing the incomparable strength and high patriotism of our working class. Now the labor emulation in the industrial sector has spread throughout the country. According to incomplete statistics, there are 2,811 factories and mines participating in the competition across the country, and more than 2,232,000 employees participating in the competition. 19,354 production teams across the country have responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang team. The patriotic bumper harvest movement launched by our peasant class has enabled our country's cotton and grain output this year to exceed that of last year. Tens of millions of peasants participated in the patriotic bumper harvest competition, and more than 12,000 mutual aid groups and more than 2,700 labor models in 30 provinces responded to the challenge of Li Shunda, a labor hero from Shanxi. In addition to enthusiastically participating in the donation of aircraft and cannons movement, the industrial and commercial circles across the country implemented collective tax payment in order to ensure that taxes are deposited in a timely manner. This movement is rapidly expanding from large and medium-sized cities to small towns across the country. The production competition movement of our working class and peasant class and the collective tax payment movement of the industrial and commercial circles have laid a solid material foundation for the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. In the past year, our people have engaged in selfless labor, adding a huge amount of wealth to the country, making our country's financial and economic strength unprecedentedly strong. Therefore, although our country is in a serious struggle to resist America and aid Korea, prices can still remain stable.

(V)

Of course, our people fully understand that the great task of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea is far from being completed; to achieve the final victory, we must continue to carry out a long-term struggle. Although the United States has accepted the Kaesong armistice negotiations, during the negotiations, it first put forward arrogant and unreasonable demands to prevent the negotiations from making any progress; then, it used evil means such as bombing and murder to force the Kaesong armistice negotiations to be interrupted; recently, it has even refused our proposal to resume negotiations for various absurd reasons; at the same time, it has launched frequent offensives on the entire Korean front. The United States, disregarding the opposition of the Chinese, Soviet, and world people, brazenly signed the illegal "Peace Treaty with Japan," and is now actively arming Japan, attempting to turn the Japanese aggressors into its minions to invade our country and other Asian countries on a large scale. The American conspiracy to expand the war still threatens our country and the people of various Asian countries. Therefore, "The people of the whole country must resolutely fight to the end to smash the American imperialist aggression plan. In all current struggles, aiding the just anti-aggression war of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has the greatest significance. Only by defeating the aggression of the United States and its servant countries in Korea can we defend the security of the motherland, prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression, liberate Taiwan, and maintain peace in the Far East. Therefore, all our compatriots across the country must do their utmost to work with the Korean people and strive for the victorious end of the Korean anti-aggression war with long-term struggle. We will not stop until we achieve our goal." (Joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations, commemorating the sixth anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War).

    伟大的抗美援朝运动
    郭沫若
  	（一）
    中国人民为反对美国侵略、保卫祖国安全及世界和平而发起的伟大的轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，到现在已经是一年了。一年以来，抗美援朝运动取得了伟大的胜利。我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，已经粉碎了美国以速决战灭亡朝鲜、侵略我国的阴谋，使敌人的有生力量蒙受了严重的损失，并把战线推到敌人发动侵略战争的“三八线”附近，迫使敌人接受了开城停战谈判。在国内，我国人民在抗美援朝运动中，全力支援前线，加紧国防建设和政治、经济、文化建设，同样获得辉煌的成就。抗美援朝成为一切工作的动力，使我国各种工作的面貌为之一新。
            （二）
    中国人民对于美国发动的侵朝战争，是极端愤慨、十分关心的。美国于去年六月二十五日挑起侵朝战争，六月二十八日，即朝鲜战争发生三天以后，毛主席在中央人民政府委员会第八次会议上指出，全中国人民的同情都将站在被侵略者方面，毛主席同时号召“全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅”。抗议美国侵略朝鲜的运动，立即在全国普遍展开。美国政府对于我国人民的正义谴责，当时采取了置之不理的态度，而迷信其无敌的神话。事实上，在朝鲜战争初期，美国已遭受严重失败，败退到大邱釜山一线，但它不但毫无悔祸之心，反于去年九月在仁川大举登陆，进一步扩大了侵朝战争。去年九月三十日，周恩来总理又向美国发出严正警告，说明“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理”。美国对于我国人民这一严重警告，仍然置之不理，竟于去年十月上旬，悍然越过“三八线”，向我国东北边境长驱冒进。其侵略矛头，在楚山城和惠山镇等地，已到达或接近鸭绿江边。同时，美国飞机则不断侵犯我国东北领空，扫射轰炸我国东北边疆，美国军舰不断炮击我国商船，破坏我国人民的生命财产。我国人民在忍无可忍的情况下，才挺身而出，决定发起抗美援朝，保家卫国的运动。为了实现中国人民的意志，我国人民志愿军乃于去年十月下旬进入朝鲜作战。
    对于美国这种外强中干的帝国主义说来，速战速决的侵略战争，是最便宜不过的买卖。美国本来企图利用其走狗李承晚，发动突然进攻，迅速摧毁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。这个计划在三天的战斗中就被粉碎了。美国海陆空军在一周内陆续参加战斗，也在朝鲜人民军的打击下迅速失败了。这次失败，对于美国统治集团来说，是很意外的。美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷在今年五月二十二日在美国参议院作证时就不得不承认：“没有人想到北朝鲜会像后来事实证明的那样强大。我们根据我们的情报而低估了他们的人数、他们的装备、他们的作战能力。”美国为了孤注一掷，于去年九月拼凑了一切可以动用于远东的军事力量，在仁川大举登陆，发动了所谓“结束朝鲜战争的总攻势”。那时由于敌我力量悬殊，朝鲜战局一度呈现了严重的局面。但在中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜、与朝鲜人民军并肩作战之后，迅速改变了这种局面。去年十月下旬开始的第一和第二两次战役，基本上击破了敌人狂妄的圣诞节总攻势；今年一月初第三次战役，则把敌人打到“三八线”以南；美国以速决战灭亡朝鲜的计划，至此完全失败。以后，敌人又企图以所谓“杀伤战”、“消耗战”的“新战法”，拖垮中朝人民部队。但是，敌人的新战法又失败了。在去年十月底到今年一月底，即敌人采取冒进战法的三个月中，敌人伤亡六万余人；而在今年一月底到五月底，即敌人采取消耗战法的四个月中，敌人伤亡十二万余人，为前一时期的两倍。各种战法被证明完全无效之后，美国侵朝刽子手麦克阿瑟乃于四月十一日狼狈下台。
    此后，朝鲜战争一直进出于“三八线”附近。中朝人民部队采取正确的消灭敌人有生力量的作战方针，牢牢地掌握着战争的主动权，进可以攻，退可以守；敌人则顾此失彼，被动应付，攻守都极困难。美国战争贩子魏德迈今年六月十二日在美国参院作证时，说了一句真话，他说：“朝鲜战争是一个无底洞”；这个“无底洞”，已经消耗了美国巨大的人力资源。从我国人民志愿军入朝作战时起，至今年九月五日止，中朝人民共歼灭美李匪军三十二万二千余人，其中美、英、法、土等军达十四万余人，其中最主要是美军。美军伤亡数字，超过美国在第二次世界大战第一年即一九四一年十二月至一九四二年十二月中伤亡总数五万八千余人的一倍以上；十四万余人，相当于美军正规编制七个多师（按每师一万八千人）的兵力，远超过美国现有十八个正规师的三分之一。美国反动头子之一胡佛甚至在去年十二月二十日关于美国外交政策的演说中就说：“联合国在朝鲜被共产党中国的‘侵略’（？）打败了，现在世界上没有任何军队足以击退中国人。”美国统治集团中的一些人，对于侵朝战争已经完全丧失信心，这就是美国为什么会接受朝鲜停战谈判的缘故；美国统治集团中的另一些人，却坚持不肯在朝鲜就此洗手，这就是美国为什么又要千方百计破坏开城停战谈判的缘故。那么，怎么办呢？是进一步孤注一掷，立刻扩大侵略战争呢？还是暂时在朝鲜拖着，以便加紧战争准备，待机扩大侵略战争呢？这就是麦克阿瑟和杜鲁门、马歇尔等曾经争执的焦点。这种争执没有本质上的区别，只有侵略方法和步骤上的不同。
    但是，不管怎样，美国灭亡朝鲜并由此进攻我国大陆的企图是决定地失败了。美国盗用“联合国”招牌，取得“五十三”国所谓“道义的”或“物资的”、“实力的”援助，向朝鲜和中国发动大举进攻，被中国人民派出的一支志愿部队和年青的朝鲜人民军所击败，这难道不是最雄辩地说明了美国是一只纸老虎么？这难道不是最有力地说明了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，大大超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量么？我国人民抗美援朝的胜利，不但直接保卫了我们伟大祖国的安全，援助了朝鲜人民的正义斗争，而且鼓舞了世界人民特别是东方人民争取和平反对侵略的决心和信心，动摇了美国侵略全世界的整个罪恶计划。一年以来，我国人民以自己的伟大的正义的斗争，向全世界证明了与继续证明着一个颠扑不破的真理：我们年青的中华人民共和国是强大无敌，是不可战胜的。
            （三）
    一年以来，我国人民在抗美援朝运动中所获得的另一伟大胜利，是全国范围内爱国主义的新高涨。我国人民在基于爱国主义的基础上，发动了抗美援朝运动；而在抗美援朝运动中，我国人民受到普遍而深入的爱国主义教育，这就进一步提高了自己的政治觉悟。一年以来，我国人民已有百分之八十受到了爱国主义教育，基本上扫除了美帝国主义百余年来对中国进行军事、政治、经济、文化侵略和怀柔、欺骗所遗留下来的“亲美”、“崇美”的反动思想和“恐美”的错误心理；树立了仇视美帝国主义，蔑视美帝国主义，鄙视美帝国主义的心理；大大提高了民族自尊心和自信心；加强了同仇敌忾、打败美国侵略的决心。这是我国人民抗美援朝运动在思想战线上的伟大胜利，在这一思想基础上，产生了彻底击败美国侵略的物质力量。
    我国人民爱国主义的新高涨、在国内集中、突出地表现在遍及全国的订立与执行爱国公约运动中。爱国公约是我国人民在抗美援朝运动中的伟大创造；它使广大人民的爱国热情和实际工作相结合，并用条约的形式固定起来；它给人民指出具体的奋斗目标，使人民的日常爱国行动有所遵循，因此，它就有力地推动了各项实际工作。现在，订立与执行爱国公约，已成为全国各界人民和机关、团体、工厂、学校中的群众运动。北京、天津、上海等城市，已有百分之八十的人口订立了爱国公约。河北全省百分之八十的农村和城市居民，已经订立了爱国公约。据该省九个专区六十个县的不完全统计，在一万五千九百六十八个农村中，有一万三千零九十六个村订立了爱国公约，占总村数的百分之八十二强。各阶层人民和各种岗位上的工作人员，以爱国公约为准绳，万众一心，为巩固国防与增强抗美援朝力量而奋斗，取得了惊人的成绩。
    我国人民支援前线，巩固国防的另一伟大行动，是从六月一日开始的全国规模的捐献飞机大炮运动。这一运动，已普及全国各地区、各阶层。这一运动是与增加生产相结合的，因此，也就有力地推动了我国的生产建设。截至九月二十五日为止，全国捐献飞机已达二千四百八十一架。到九月二十五日止，捐款入库者已有九千九百七十亿。为建设巩固的国防，我国知识青年响应祖国的召唤，踊跃投考各种军事干部学校，两次报考人数，达五十八万余人。
    我国人民深深知道，全力支援朝鲜前线，是当前最重要的任务。我国人民志愿军进入朝鲜作战后，全国立即发起支援志愿军的广大运动。志愿铁道职工，志愿汽车司机，志愿医疗队、防疫队等，接二连三地开赴朝鲜，支援中朝人民军队作战。据极不完全统计，全国已有五十余个志愿医疗队开赴朝鲜。
    我国人民热烈响应抗美援朝总会的号召，发动了广大规模的募集慰劳金、救济品运动。截至今年五月三十日止，全国人民为了慰劳中朝人民部队和救济朝鲜灾民，共捐款一千一百八十六亿余元，捐献慰问袋七十七万余个，慰问品一百二十六万余件。
    我国人民特别关怀正在朝鲜前线艰苦奋战的志愿军战士的家属，进行了大规模的优抚烈属、军属的工作。察哈尔省人民把优抚工作当成巩固国防和巩固部队的重大政治任务，给农村的烈属、军属“家家种好地”，使城市的烈属、军属“户户有职业”，保证烈属、军属的生活不能低于当地群众生活水平。
    为了传达前后方抗美援朝斗争的情况和经验，以鼓舞前方的中国人民志愿军和全国人民斗争的决心和胜利的信心，中国人民曾于三月间派遣慰问团赴朝鲜前线慰问，向人民志愿军致崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。中国人民志愿军，亦曾派遣代表回国向全国人民作抗美援朝的报告，这一项工作在爱国主义教育方面，收到了极大的成绩。
            （四）
    抗美援朝是一切工作的经常起作用的动力，这一真理，已为我国各种伟大的实际运动所证明。过去一年内，我国已有一亿五千万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，约有九千万贫苦农民，从地主手中取得一千二百万公顷的土地。其势之猛，其行之速，在我国历史上是空前的。我国翻身农民把自己的土地要求和爱国主义结合起来，以消灭地主阶级，作为击败美国侵略的有力步骤，因此，他们高呼“前方打美头，后方挖美根”的口号，给予美帝国主义在中国的最后支柱以歼灭性的打击。
    我国人民非常懂得“堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的”，所以，为了巩固胜利果实，肃清美蒋匪帮的走狗爪牙，又在全国范围展开了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动。一百多万土匪被剿灭了，潜伏在各地的反革命分子基本上被肃清了。这就使得革命政权和民主秩序得到进一步的巩固，而敌人潜伏的力量则受到歼灭性的打击。
    在抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动中，我国爱国的基督教和天主教徒，在爱国主义的旗帜下，在全国范围内展开了“三自革新”运动，控诉、驱逐潜藏在基督教和天主教内的帝国主义分子。对于帝国主义分子黎培里等的斗争，在全国宗教界形成史无前例的群众运动。现在，全国已有二十七万七千八百余基督教徒，十八万天主教徒在革新宣言上签字。我国宗教界这种爱国行动，彻底击碎了美帝国主义企图利用宗教反对中国人民的无耻阴谋。
    一年来的抗美援朝运动，曾经有力的推动了工人阶级的劳动竞赛和农业丰产竞赛运动。由于这种竞赛运动是在高度爱国主义的基础上开展起来的，其规模、深度都较过去为大。工人们提出“工厂就是战场，机器就是枪炮，多出一件产品就是增强一分杀敌力量，减少一件废品就是消灭一个敌人”的口号，惊人的生产纪录不断涌现出来。今年东北工人阶级，响应高岗主席的号召，掀起超额创造价值一千万吨粮食财富的增产节约运动，这一事实，集中地表现了我国工人阶级无可比拟的力量和爱国主义的高涨。现在工业部门的劳动竞赛已普及全国，据不完全统计，全国参加竞赛的厂矿单位有二千八百十一个，参加竞赛的职工有二百二十三万二千余人。全国有一万九千三百五十四个生产小组，已向马恒昌小组应战。我国农民阶级发起的爱国丰产运动，已使我国今年的棉粮产量超过去年。参加爱国丰产竞赛的农民有数千万人，仅向山西劳动英雄李顺达应战的，就有三十个省的一万二千多个互助组和二千七百多个劳动模范。全国工商界除了热烈参加捐献飞机大炮运动外，为了保证税款及时入库，实行了集体纳税。这一运动，正在全国各大中城市向小城镇迅速扩展。我国工人阶级、农民阶级的生产竞赛运动和工商界的集体纳税运动，已给抗美援朝运动打下坚实的物质基础。一年以来，我国人民进行忘我的劳动，给国家增加了巨量的财富，使得我国财政经济力量，空前强大起来。因此，我国虽然处在抗美援朝严重斗争的情况下，物价依然能够稳定。

    当然，我国人民完全懂得：抗美援朝的伟大斗争任务，还远远没有完成；要取得最后的胜利，必须继续进行长期的奋斗。美国虽然接受了开城停战谈判，但在谈判期间，始则提出蛮横无理的要求，阻止谈判获得任何进展；继则以轰炸、谋杀等罪恶手段，强使开城停战谈判中断；最近竟以各种荒谬理由，拒绝我方恢复谈判的建议；与此同时，更在朝鲜全线，发动了频繁的进攻。美国不顾中国、苏联和世界人民的反对，悍然签订了非法的“对日和约”，现正积极武装日本，企图把日本的侵略分子变成它的爪牙，大举侵略我国和亚洲其他国家。美国扩大战争的阴谋，仍然威胁着我国和亚洲各国人民。因此，“全中国人民必须为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划而坚决奋斗到底。在当前的一切奋斗中，援助朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的正义的反侵略战争有最伟大的意义。只有击败美国及其仆从国家在朝鲜的侵略，才能保卫祖国的安全，才能防止日本侵略的再起，才能解放台湾，才能维护远东和平。因此，我全国同胞，必须竭尽全力，和朝鲜人民一道，用长期的奋斗来争取朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利结束，不达目的，誓不休止。”（各民主党派、各人民团体，纪念抗日战争胜利日六周年联合宣言）。
