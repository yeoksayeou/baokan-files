    The Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau adopted the advanced Soviet method of earth filling and ramming in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, making the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway the fastest and most stable railway ever built in the history of railway engineering in our country.
    The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway passes through mostly mountainous areas. The earth excavation and filling work along the entire line is enormous, averaging more than 50,000 cubic meters of earth to be excavated and filled per kilometer. In some areas, the required fill is 20 meters high. If the earth filling is not solid, the roadbed is in danger of sinking and being washed away by mountain torrents during the rainy season. In the past, when building other railways in our country, the roadbed filling work was usually done by means of subsidence filling, that is, filling the earth higher than the road surface and letting the fill settle naturally. This required one or two rainy seasons before the tracks could be laid, and the line could not be opened to traffic immediately after the track laying was completed. In order to accelerate the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and consolidate the roadbed, the Southwest Railway Bureau accepted the suggestion of Soviet experts and adopted the Soviet method of building railway roadbeds by filling and ramming the earth, that is, filling the earth in layers, and ramming it once every three Chinese inches of filling, compressing the three Chinese inches of loose soil into two Chinese inches. This greatly increased the stability of the roadbed, making it possible to lay the tracks and operate the trains as soon as the roadbed was built. On June 30, the road construction and track laying work from Chongqing to Yongchuan was completed simultaneously. The next day, the train arrived in Yongchuan. The section from Chongqing to Yongchuan started business on September 1st, and has been running for more than a month now. The roadbed is in good condition and no accidents have occurred.
    This working method of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been praised by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government. Now, the method of building roadbeds by filling and ramming earth has been extended to the Tianshui-Lanzhou line in the Northwest.

    成渝铁路接受苏联填土打夯的筑路法已成我国修筑得最快和最稳固的铁路
    西南铁路工程局在修筑成渝铁路工程中，采用苏联先进的填土打夯的筑路法，使成渝铁路成为我国铁路工程史上修筑最快修得最稳固的一条铁路。
    成渝路沿线多为山岳地带，全线挖方、填方工程很大，平均每公里要挖土和填土达五万多方。有些地区需要填土二十公尺高。填土工程如不坚固，雨水季节路基即有沉落和被山水冲坍的危险。过去我国在修筑其他铁路时，路基填土工程都习惯用沉落填土的办法，即填土高于路面，让填土自然沉落。这样必须经过一两个雨季后方能铺轨，在完成铺轨后也不能立即通车营业。为了加速成渝铁路的筑路工程和巩固路基，西南铁路局接受了苏联专家的建议，采用了苏联填土打夯修筑铁路路基的办法，即分层填土，每填土三公寸便打夯一次，把三公寸厚的松土压为二公寸。这样就大大增加了路基的稳固程度，能够在路基筑好后，就可以铺轨、行车。六月三十日重庆到永川段的筑路和铺轨工程同时完成，第二天，车子便开到了永川。重庆到永川段在九月一日起开始营业，到现在已行车一个多月，路基情况良好，未出任何事故。
    成渝铁路的这种工作方法受到中央人民政府铁道部的表扬。现在，填土打夯修筑路基的办法已推广到西北天兰线上。
