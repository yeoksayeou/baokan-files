    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th – On the morning of October 11th, liaison officers from both sides continued to hold a meeting at Panmunjom to negotiate the resumption of meetings between the two delegations. The liaison officers from the Korean-Chinese delegation were Colonel Zhang Chunshan, Colonel Chai Chengwen, and Colonel Li Pingyi. The liaison officers from the United Nations Command delegation were Colonel Murray, Lieutenant Colonel Edwards, and Lieutenant Colonel Li Shurong.
    During the discussions before the adjournment at 12:08 pm, the liaison officers from both sides had largely reached agreement on all necessary temporary arrangements for the resumption of meetings between the two delegations, such as the specific location of the conference venue, the specific methods for both sides to jointly be responsible for security in the conference area, and the equipment and layout of the conference venue. Therefore, at the meeting that began at 3:00 pm, our liaison officer specifically suggested that the two delegations resume their meetings at 1:00 pm on October 12th. However, the liaison officer from the other side still insisted on discussing issues such as the scope of the neutral zone and rejected our suggestion that the two delegations resume their meetings at 1:00 pm on October 12th. Therefore, our liaison officer once again requested the other side to study the letter from our Commander to the other side's Commander on October 9th and suggested that the liaison officers from both sides continue to hold a meeting at 10:00 am on October 12th.
    The afternoon meeting ended at 4:10 pm.

    双方联络官昨继续协商复会事宜
    我方提出复会时间仍为美方无理拒绝
    【新华社开城十一日电】十月十一日上午十时双方联络官在板门店继续举行会议，协商双方代表团复会的事宜。朝中代表团出席联络官为张春山上校，柴成文上校与李平一上校。联合国军代表团出席联络官为穆莱上校，爱德华中校，李树荣中校。
    双方联络官在十二时零八分休会前的讨论中，对于会场的具体地点，会议区双方共同负责警卫的具体办法，以及会场的设备与布置等，双方代表团复会时的所有必须的临时安排问题，都已大体上取得了一致的意见。因此，我方联络官在下午三时开始的会议上具体建议在十月十二日下午一时，双方代表团复会。但对方联络官仍坚持讨论中立区的范围等问题，拒绝我方在十月十二日下午一时双方代表团即行复会的建议。我方联络官因此再度要求对方研究十月九日我方司令官致对方司令官的函件，并建议在十月十二日上午十时双方联络官继续举行会议。
    下午的会议于四时十分结束。
