    On the Results of the British Parliamentary Elections
    *Pravda* Editorial, October 28th

    The British held early parliamentary elections on October 25th. In this election, the Conservative Party won 319 seats, and the Labour Party won 293 seats. Therefore, the Conservative Party is in power, the Attlee government has resigned, and Conservative Party leader Churchill has been ordered to form a new government.

    The Labour Party's failure is a direct consequence of the foreign and domestic policies pursued by the Labour government since its first day in office. As everyone knows, in the 1945 parliamentary elections, the Labour Party campaigned with a widely publicized program: in terms of domestic policy, to improve the economic situation in Britain, improve the people's welfare, and carry out extensive social reforms; in terms of foreign policy, to consolidate peace and international cooperation. The Labour Party emphasized that if it came to power, one of its main tasks in international affairs would be to strengthen friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The Labour Party openly declared in its campaign manifesto that it was necessary to strengthen the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At that time, Labour Party members accused the Conservative Party of adopting a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union, and they declared that the Conservative Party had lost the opportunity to establish an alliance that could completely avoid war.

    The British people believed these promises, and they voted for the Labour Party candidates in the 1945 elections, when the Labour Party won an overwhelming majority of seats in Parliament. However, the Labour government did not abide by the guarantees it had generously offered in the 1945 election campaign in order to win the votes of gullible people. The Labour government did not follow the policy of peace and international cooperation it had promised to the voters, but instead embarked on an arms race, promoted new wars, slavishly obeyed the demands of American aggressive forces, and increasingly lost Britain's independence and sovereignty. It was the Labour government that, together with the US government, organized and promoted the Atlantic aggressive bloc, which defined its task as preparing for war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The Labour government of Attlee and Morrison, together with the US imperialists, worked to implement the US plan - to surround the Soviet Union with a network of naval and air bases, and to turn several of Britain's own islands into American military bases. It was the Labour government that dragged Britain into the aggressive war against the Korean people and sent armed forces to participate in this war.

    After taking office in 1945, the Labour government violated its international obligations regarding Germany and Japan under the Potsdam Agreement, and systematically implemented plans to restore and strengthen the militarism of both countries. In all these respects, it unquestioningly followed the US policy and unconditionally followed the US aggressive policy.

    Economically, it made Britain completely dependent on the United States, made Britain accept the Marshall Plan, and followed US orders to restrict economic relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies and reduce trade with them.

    A foreign policy that undermines international relations and promotes new wars and arms races can only lead to, and indeed has led to, a decline in the living standards of the British people, bringing new burdens and suffering to the vast majority of the British people.

    In the February 1950 elections, the Labour government lost many seats in Parliament and barely avoided defeat. At that time, the voters made it very clear to the Labour Party that they were dissatisfied and unhappy with the Labour Party's domestic and foreign policies.

    This was a serious warning from the people to the Labour Party and its reactionary leaders, because they had learned from experience just how much the Labour Party's promises were worth.

    But even after 1950, the Labour Party continued to implement an aggressive policy in foreign affairs with even greater enthusiasm, and attacked the vital interests of the people in domestic affairs.

    As a result of this policy of the Labour Party, Britain's domestic and international economic position has not only not improved, but has greatly deteriorated, because Britain has been financially enslaved by American monopoly capitalists, who have increasingly squeezed Britain out of the world market and more resolutely reduced Britain to a second-rate power. As everyone knows, during this period, the cost of living for the British people has greatly increased, the prices of food and industrial products have risen, and the Labour government has increased military spending and carried out a frenzied arms race in order to implement the US aggressive plan, with the result that the burden on the people has become increasingly heavy.

    The British people increasingly realized that, due to wrong policies, the Labour Party had fallen into a difficult situation in both international and domestic affairs. The British people's dissatisfaction with the Labour government's policies was manifested in the crisis within the Labour Party, due to which the Labour Party had to hold early elections in October 1951.

    The results of the election have been published - the Labour Party has failed, and the Conservative Party led by Churchill has regained power.

    The Labour government's policies made the British people leave the Labour Party and vote for the Conservative Party, and they obviously hoped that the Conservative government in power would change Britain's policies. However, Britain's policies will not change during the new government's tenure, because the Labour government was in fact pursuing the Conservative Party's policies.

    As everyone knows, in capitalist countries that practice so-called representative systems, the various competing bourgeois parties put forward various programs during parliamentary elections and do not hesitate to make all kinds of beautiful promises to voters. However, as soon as the parliamentary elections are over, the politicians who lead these parties quickly forget their promises completely.

    Despite the different election platforms and programs of all bourgeois parties, they have only one purpose - to defend and strengthen the capitalist order and consolidate the bourgeois system. This is the essence of bourgeois parliamentary politics, which is one of the political systems aimed at ensuring capitalist power, and it makes "capitalist power in a bourgeois democratic republic so reliable and so stable that it cannot be shaken by changes in personnel, institutions, or parties." (Lenin)

    We see that the current British parliamentary elections are exactly this situation, in which the Conservative government has replaced the Labour government in the British elections. However, the Labour Party's failure in the British parliamentary elections is of great political significance.

    The Labour Party's failure in this election proves that the Labour Party has lost power in Britain, and at the same time shows that it is increasingly difficult for the ruling groups in capitalist countries to deceive the masses of the people.

    The same fate awaits any government in Britain that takes this path. (Xinhua News Agency)

    论英国议会选举的结果
    苏联真理报十月二十八日社论
    十月二十五日，英国举行了提前举行的议会选举。在这次选举中，保守党获得三百一十九席，工党获得二百九十三席。因此，保守党当权，艾德礼政府已辞职，保守党党魁邱吉尔奉命组织新政府。
    工党的失败是工党政府自执政的第一天起所遵循的外交和内政政策的直接后果。大家知道，在一九四五年的议会选举中，工党是以这样一个广泛宣传的政纲出来竞选的：在内政政策方面，改善英国的经济情况，增进人民福利，进行广泛的社会改革；在外交政策方面，巩固和平与国际合作。工党强调说，假如它当了权，它在国际事务方面的主要任务之一将是加强与苏联的友好关系。工党在它的竞选宣言中公开声明必须加强英美苏三国间的联盟。当时工党分子指责保守党对苏联采取敌对政策，他们宣称，保守党丧失了建立可以完全避免战争的联盟的机会。
    英国人民相信了这些诺言，他们在一九四五年的选举中投票选举工党的候选人，当时工党在议会中获得压倒多数的席位。但是工党政府并未遵守它在一九四五年竞选运动中为了获得易受欺骗的人民的选票而慷慨提出的保证。工党政府没有遵循它向选民们保证的和平与国际合作的政策，反而走上了军备竞赛，促进新战争、奴颜婢膝地遵从美国侵略势力的要求以及日益丧失英国的独立和主权的道路。与美国政府一道组织及推动大西洋侵略集团的是工党政府，这个大西洋集团为自己规定的任务是准备对苏联及人民民主国家进行战争。艾德礼和莫里逊的工党政府与美帝国主义者一道，努力实施美国的计划——以海空基地网包围苏联，并把英国自己的几个岛变为美国的军事基地。把英国拖入反对朝鲜人民的侵略战争并派遣武装部队参加这个战争的，正是工党政府。
    工党政府在一九四五年执政后，违反了它根据波茨坦协定所承担的对于德国和日本的国际义务，并且有系统地实施恢复和加强德日两国军国主义的计划。在所有这一些方面，它毫无异议地遵循美国的政策，无条件地追随着美国的侵略政策前进。
    在经济上它使英国完全依赖于美国，使英国接受马歇尔计划，并遵照美国的命令限制与苏联及人民民主国家的经济关系并减少对苏联与人民民主国家的贸易。
    破坏国际关系以及促进新战争与军备竞赛的外交政策，只会促成而且的确已经促成了英国人民生活水平的降低，为英国绝大多数人民带来新的负担与痛苦。
    在一九五○年二月的选举中，工党政府在议会中失去了不少议席，很勉强地避免了失败的命运，那时选民们非常明白地向工党表示，他们对于工党的内政与外交政策都感觉不满和不快。
    这是人民对于工党及其反动头子们的严重警告，因为他们已经从经验中知道了工党的诺言究竟值多少钱。
    但是就在一九五○年以后，工党以更大的热情在外交方面继续实施侵略政策，并在内政方面向人民的重大利益进攻。
    由于工党的这种政策，英国在国内与国际的经济地位不仅没有改进，而且大大地恶化了，因为英国在财政上已被美国的垄断资本家所奴役，他们已将英国日益排挤于世界市场以外，而且更坚决地把英国降到二等国的地位。大家都知道，在这一时期，英国人的生活费用大大地上升，粮食与工业品的价格日益上涨，工党政府为了实施美国的侵略计划于是就增加军事预算并进行疯狂的军备竞赛，结果人民身上的负担也日益沉重了。
    英国人民愈益清楚地认识到：由于错误的政策，工党在国际和国内问题上都已陷入困难的境地。英国人民对工党政府政策的不满表现在工党内部的危机上，由于这种危机，工党不得不在一九五一年十月提前举行选举。
    选举的结果已经发表了——工党失败，邱吉尔领导的保守党又重新当权。
    工党政府的政策使得英国人民离开工党而投保守党的票，他们显然是希望保守党政府执政会改变英国的政策。可是，英国的政策在新政府执政期间是不会有改变的，因为工党政府事实上奉行的是保守党的政策。
    大家知道，在实行所谓代议制政体的资本主义国家中，互相竞争的各资产阶级政党在议会竞选时提出各种政纲，并且毫不犹豫地向选民提出各种漂亮的诺言。可是议会选举刚一结束，领导这些政党的政客们很快地就完全忘记了他们的诺言。
    尽管所有资产阶级政党的竞选纲领和政纲各有不同，它们却只有一个目的——保卫和加强资本主义秩序，巩固资产阶级制度。这是资产阶级议会政治的本质，议会政治是旨在确保资本主义权力的政治体制之一，它使“资本主义权力在资产阶级民主共和国中如此可靠，如此稳定，以致可以不因人事、机构或政党的改变而动摇。”（列宁语）
    我们看到目前的英国议会选举正是这种情形，英国选举中保守党政府已代替了工党政府。可是，工党在英国议会选举中的失败是有重大的政治意义的。
    工党在这次选举中的失败证明工党在英国失势，同时表明资本主义国家的统治集团要欺骗人民大众，是愈益困难了。
    同样的命运等待着英国的走这种道路的任何政府。（新华社）
