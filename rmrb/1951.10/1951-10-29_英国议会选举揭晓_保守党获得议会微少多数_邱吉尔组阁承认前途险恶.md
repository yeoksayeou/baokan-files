Xinhua News Agency, October 28th dispatch from London: The British parliamentary elections were held on the 25th. As of the evening of the 27th, the results of the election for 622 of the 625 seats in the House of Commons have been announced. The Conservative Party won 320 seats, becoming the majority party in Parliament. The Labour Party won 293 seats, the Liberal Party won 6 seats, and other parties won 3 seats. The remaining three seats have yet to be determined.

Labour government Prime Minister Attlee submitted his resignation to the King on the 26th. The King immediately authorized Conservative Party leader Churchill to form a government. On the evening of the 27th, Churchill announced the first list of cabinet members from the Conservative Party, with Churchill as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Eden as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, and Leader of the House of Commons, and Butler as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

TASS Moscow, October 27th dispatch points out: "The Labour Party's defeat in this election did not come as a surprise. The Labour Party's failure is the result of the erroneous policies pursued by the Labour government. It was at a loss both in domestic and international affairs, and thus lost its prestige among some voters. Labour figures had promised to pursue a policy of maintaining peace and friendly relations with other countries; but in reality, they pursued a policy against peace, unconditionally supported the aggressive plans of American monopoly capitalists, and constantly lost Britain's sovereignty and independence. Such a policy ran counter to the Labour Party's previous promises to improve the national economic situation and raise the people's living standards. Therefore, the people abandoned the Labour Party."

However, the Labour Party's defeat does not mean that the Conservative Party has won a genuine victory. Many British voters only switched their votes to the Conservative Party because they hated the Labour government's disastrous arms expansion and war preparation policies. They obviously harbored some hope that British policy might change. This fact is even acknowledged by the media of the American ruling clique, which is trying hard to support the Conservative Party's rise to power. A Washington diplomatic correspondent for the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain commented on the 26th that in this election, Churchill was merely a "beneficiary" of British voters' "sense of weariness." He said: British voters have become "weary" of Labour rule, "so they kicked out the Attlee government." At the end of the war, they were tired of Churchill and therefore rejected the Conservative Party. Now, as before, they are voting against someone – not for someone."

It is quite obvious that the Conservative Party's rise to power will not ease the crisis facing the British ruling clique in the slightest. Facts have proven that the bankrupt policies pursued by the Labour Party are precisely the policies of the Conservative Party. And the Conservative Party's preparation to further implement imperialist policies for the purpose of war and expansion is destined to lead to greater setbacks and disasters.

In a situation where Britain's colonial rule abroad is constantly being hit and the domestic war economy is deteriorating, the Conservative government will face a perilous future full of crises from the very beginning. Therefore, Churchill's statement after the election victory on the 26th obviously could not sing much of a happy tune. He had to repeatedly emphasize: "We have difficult days ahead of us." Agence France-Presse pointed out: The problems facing the Churchill government are: "How to deal with the complex domestic and international situation caused by the devaluation of the pound, the inflation caused by rearmament, and the responsibilities towards Iran and Egypt." The Associated Press also said that the new government "is encountering the same huge problems that Labour once faced."

Not only that, but the foundation of Churchill's new cabinet is as fragile as that of the Labour government. The British ruling clique and its American masters' attempt to produce a "strong government" in this election has completely failed to achieve its goal. The Conservative Party now has only an absolute majority of eighteen seats in the House of Commons, far short of the forty-seat majority that Britain usually needs to maintain a so-called "stable government." Reuters London, October 27th, admitted: "Most observers believe that Churchill has not obtained the large amount of parliamentary support he wanted from the voters, and his narrow majority constitutes a shaky foundation for long-term rule." The Associated Press also admitted that although the Conservative Party won more seats in the election, the total number of votes it received was less than that of the Labour Party. Therefore, Churchill is ruling a "divided country." The Conservative Party's Yorkshire Post lamented in a commentary on the 27th that Churchill's failure to obtain full power was "a regrettable pity," and that "he and his partners will fall into a troublesome situation."

### 英国议会选举揭晓  保守党获得议会微少多数  邱吉尔组阁承认前途险恶

    英国议会选举揭晓
    保守党获得议会微少多数
    邱吉尔组阁承认前途险恶
    【新华社二十八日讯】伦敦消息：英国议会选举已于二十五日举行。截至二十七日晚间止，在下院全部六百二十五个议席中，有六百二十二席的选举结果业已揭晓。保守党获得三百二十席，成为议会多数党，工党获得二百九十三席，自由党获得六席，其他三席。尚余三席未能确定。
    工党政府首相艾德礼于二十六日即向英王提出辞呈。英王当即授权保守党领袖邱吉尔组织政府。二十七日晚间，邱吉尔宣布了他的保守党内阁的第一批阁员名单，由邱吉尔任首相兼国防大臣，艾登任副首相兼外交大臣并任下院领袖，巴特勒任财政大臣。
    塔斯社莫斯科二十七日电指出：“工党在这次大选中的失败并不出乎人们意料之外，工党的失败是由于工党政府所奉行的错误政策的结果，它在国内和国际问题上都一筹莫展，因而丧失了它在部分选民中的威信。工党人物曾提出诺言说要奉行与其他国家保持和平与友好关系的政策；可是他们实际上奉行反对和平的政策，无条件地支持美国垄断资本家的侵略计划，不断地丧失英国的主权和独立。这样一种政策是和工党以前指出的改善国家经济状况，提高人民生活水准的诺言背道而驰的。因此，人民唾弃了工党。”
    但是，工党的失败并不等于保守党获得了真正的胜利。许多英国选民只是由于憎恶工党政府招致灾难的扩军备战政策才改投保守党的票，他们显然抱有一些期待英国政策可能有所改变的希望。这个事实，甚至竭力替保守党上台撑腰的美国统治集团的舆论，也不得不予以承认。斯克利浦斯霍华德系报纸驻华盛顿外交记者二十六日评论说：在这次大选中，邱吉尔不过是英国选民的“厌倦感”的“受惠者”。他说：英国选民对于工党统治已感到“厌倦”，“所以他们踢开了艾德礼政府”。在战争结束时，他们厌倦邱吉尔因而否决了保守党。现在和上次一样，他们是在投反对谁的票——而不是在投拥护谁的票。”
    十分明显，保守党的上台丝毫也不能缓和英国统治集团所遭遇的危机。事实证明，工党所奉行的业已破产的政策正是保守党的政策。而保守党准备进一步实行以战争与扩张为目的的帝国主义政策，就注定了要招致更大的挫折与灾祸。
    在英国在国外的殖民统治不断受到打击和国内备战经济日趋恶化的情况下，保守党政府上台伊始就要面临着危机四伏的险恶前途。因此邱吉尔二十六日在选举胜利后发表的声明中显然唱不出多少欢乐的调子，他不得不一再着重地说：“在我们面前，有着艰苦的日子。”法新社指出：邱吉尔政府所面临的问题是：“如何应付因英镑的贬值、重整军备而引起的通货膨胀、对伊朗和埃及的责任等所造成的国内外复杂局势。”美联社也说，新政府“正遭遇着和工党所曾经面临的同样的巨大的难题”。
    不仅如此，邱吉尔新阁的基础也和工党政府同样脆弱。英国统治集团及其美国主子企图在这次大选中产生一个“有力政府”的打算完全没有达到目的。保守党在下院中现在只有十八席的绝对多数，离开英国通常维持一个所谓“稳定的政府”所必需的四十席多数还差得远。路透社伦敦二十七日电承认：“大多数观察家认为，邱吉尔没有获得他想要从选民那里获得的大量的议会支持，他的微弱的多数构成了长期执政的动摇不稳的基础。”美联社也承认，保守党虽然在大选中获得较多的议席，但是它所获得的选票总数却比工党还少，因此，邱吉尔所统治的是一个“分裂的国家”。保守党的约克郡邮报二十七日在评论中悲叹道：邱吉尔没有获得充分权力是“一件可悲的憾事”，“他和他的伙伴将要陷入烦恼的处境中”。
