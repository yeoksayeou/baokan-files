    To Realize the Northeast State-Owned Enterprises' Production Increase and Savings Plan of Ten Million Tons of Grain
    Northeast Local Industry Plans to Increase Production by One Million Five Hundred Thousand Tons
    Northeast Railway System Strives to Create Surplus Profits of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Tons Before the End of the Year
    Local industries in various provinces and cities of Northeast China are currently actively leveraging their industrial potential to strive for the realization of the plan for all Northeast state-owned enterprises to increase production and save the equivalent of ten million tons of grain. According to statistics from six provinces and five directly-administered cities, the total value of local industries' production increase and savings plans has exceeded one million five hundred thousand tons. Among these, the value of increased production and savings from increasing output and varieties is equivalent to more than one million eighty-eight thousand nine hundred tons of grain, the value of increased production and savings from reducing costs is equivalent to fifteen thousand seven hundred and forty tons of grain, and the value of increased production and savings from accelerating capital turnover is equivalent to twenty-nine thousand seven hundred and forty tons of grain. The realization of this plan is of great significance for ensuring the supply of necessities for the lives and production of urban and rural people and for enhancing the leading role of the state-owned economy.
    The production potential of local industries in Northeast China is considerable. In the first half of this year, the utilization rate of machinery and equipment in local industries was only 50% to 60%. Therefore, it is entirely possible to increase output and varieties by tapping the potential of machinery and equipment, improving technical operations, and learning from advanced experiences. For example, at a certain ceramics factory in Liaodong, through the cooperation of kiln workers and technicians in conducting experiments, the kiln firing time was reduced from 58 hours to 45 hours, and coal consumption was also reduced from 20.25 tons to 14.44 tons, resulting in a reduction of 6% in total costs. In the first half of this year, the capital turnover period for local industries in Lushun-Dalian was 176 days. In the second half of the year, the plan is to shorten the capital turnover period to 148 days by improving supply and marketing, avoiding stockpiling of finished products, rationally reserving raw materials, disposing of stagnant materials, and promptly clearing up creditor's rights and debts.
    Currently, the industrial bureaus (departments) of various provinces and cities are inspecting the implementation of the plans by various units. In Liaoxi Province, due to the in-depth inspections conducted by cadres in factories and mines, twelve factories and mines have already overfulfilled their production increase and savings plans for July and August.

    The movement for Northeast state-owned enterprises to increase production and save the equivalent of ten million tons of grain wealth has now expanded to the railway sector. The Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways has decided to strive to create a surplus profit of RMB 10 trillion (equivalent to 1.5 million tons of grain) for the entire Northeast railway system (including the China Changchun Railway) before the end of the year. This production increase and savings plan is based on the circumstances of new grain being put on the market, increased coal consumption, a significant increase in import and export trade, and a sharp increase in the total volume of transportation on the entire line this winter. The specific plan formulated by the office is: 1. Accelerate vehicle turnover, exceeding the original loading plan by 8%, which can increase revenue by RMB 5 trillion; 2. Reduce fuel consumption by 10%, reduce material consumption by 10% to 20%, and reduce the costs of the factory affairs department and affiliated enterprises, which can save a total of RMB 5 trillion. From January to August of this year, the Northeast Railway has consistently failed to complete its monthly plans. In the future, it must not only overfulfill the plans but also compensate for past losses. Therefore, this task is very arduous. However, there is a large amount of untapped potential in the Northeast Railway. If the vehicle turnaround time can be reduced by only four hours, the loading capacity can be increased by 5%. Therefore, the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways calls on all employees of the entire line to establish a fighting spirit and strive to complete the plan for a surplus profit of RMB 10 trillion.

    为实现东北国营企业增产节约千万吨粮食计划
    东北地方工业计划增产百五十万吨
    东北铁路系统争取年底以前创造超额利润百五十万吨
    东北各省市地方工业目前正在积极发挥工业潜在能力，为实现全东北国营企业增产节约价值一千万吨粮食的计划而奋斗。据六个省五个直辖市的统计，地方工业增产节约计划的总值已超过一百五十万吨。其中从增加产量与品种方面增产节约的价值等于一百零八万八千九百多吨粮食，从降低成本方面增产节约的价值等于粮食十五万七千四百多吨，从加速资金周转方面增产节约的价值等于粮食二十九万七千四百多吨。这一计划的实现，对于保证城乡人民生活与生产必需品的供应和增强国营经济的领导作用，有着重大的意义。
    东北地方工业的生产潜力是相当巨大的。今年上半年地方工业机器设备利用率仅为百分之五十至六十，因此从发挥机器设备潜力、改进技术操作、学习先进经验等方面着手，来提高产量与增加品种，是完全可能的。如辽东某陶瓷厂由于烧窑工人与技术人员合作进行试验，使烧窑时间由五十八小时降到四十五小时，用煤量也由二十点二五吨减到十四点四四吨，总成本因而降低了百分之六。旅大市地方工业今年上半年资金周转期是一百七十六天，下半年计划从搞好供销、不积压成品、合理储备原材料、处理呆滞物资、及时清理债权债务等方面，把资金周转期缩短到一百四十八天。
    目前各省市工业厅（局）正检查各单位执行计划的情况。辽西省由于干部深入厂矿进行了检查，已有十二个厂矿超额完成了七、八月份的增产节约计划。（新华社）
    东北国营企业增产节约一千万吨粮食财富的运动，现已扩展到铁道部门。铁道部驻东北特派员办事处决定在年底以前，争取整个东北铁路系统（包括中长路在内）创造超额利润一万亿元人民币，折合粮食一百五十万吨。这一增产节约计划是根据新粮上市、用煤量增加，进出口贸易有显著提高、以及今冬全路运输量激增等情况决定的。该处所订出的具体计划是：一、加速车辆周转，超过原订的装车计划百分之八，可增加收入五千亿元；二、将燃料消耗减少百分之十，材料消耗减少百分之十至二十，降低厂务部及附属企业的成本，共可节约开支五千亿元。东北全路从今年一月至八月，一直未完成月度计划，今后则不仅要超额完成计划，而且要补偿过去的亏欠，因此这一任务是非常艰巨的。但东北铁路存在着很大的潜在力量尚未发挥，仅车辆的停留时间一项，如能减少四小时，即可提高装车能力百分之五。所以铁道部东北特派员办事处号召全路员工树立战斗作风，为完成超额利润一万亿元的计划而努力。（新华社）
