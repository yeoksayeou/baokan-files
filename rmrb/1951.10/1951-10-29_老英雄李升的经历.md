    The Experiences of Old Hero Li Sheng
    By our reporter Bai Yuan
    Twenty years ago, during the "September 18th Incident" when Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China, Li Sheng, an old man in his sixties, was driving his cart, making a living by transporting postal packages between remote towns and villages along the Songhua River, Heilongjiang River, and the Hinggan Mountains. Before that, Li Sheng had already lived a life of displacement, hardship, and twists and turns. His ancestral home was in Dezhou, Shandong. When he was twenty-five years old, due to severe flooding in his hometown, he fled alone to Northeast China to escape the famine. He served as a soldier for a few years, and later in Fangzheng County, Songjiang Province, he obtained some wasteland from the then-Qing government to cultivate painstakingly, but after several years of hard work, he still could not make a living. Later, the Russian Tsarist government recruited laborers in Northeast China to build railways, so he followed them to the Russian border to build railways for the Tsarist government until the October Revolution broke out. There, he witnessed the scene after the October Revolution. He saw how the peasants in the countryside rose up to overthrow the rule of the landlords; on the railways, he saw how the workers rose up to fight against the Tsarist government. Li Sheng also participated in the workers' struggle against the foremen on the railway at that time. Later, because the Red Army and the White bandits were at war, fighting every day, and the railway was also destroyed, he returned to Northeast China and made a living by cutting rice and doing odd jobs for others along the Songhua River. Many years passed in this way. He spent eighty silver dollars, which he had saved up with great effort, to buy two horses and a cart, continuing his wandering life until the "September 18th Incident."
    At that time, the Chinese Communist Party's Northeast Party organization was secretly mobilizing and organizing the people's revolutionary movement everywhere. In the small towns and villages where Li Sheng traveled with his cart, he met local revolutionary workers and participated in the struggles they organized, and together with them, he organized guerrillas in Heligang, Tangyuan County, Songjiang Province, to launch a struggle against the Japanese invaders. Soon, guerrilla units were organized everywhere, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was established. Li Sheng then accepted the task assigned to him by the organization and served as a liaison in the Anti-Japanese United Army. He drove his cart, ostensibly transporting packages for others as a cover, but actually delivering letters and intelligence and carrying out liaison work for the Anti-Japanese United Army. Once, the Japanese took his cart and had him transport military uniforms and bullets for them. It was a cold October day, and the wind was howling. His cart was loaded with enemy cotton uniforms and ammunition boxes, and he was walking along the Songhua River. Taking advantage of the enemy's inattention, he picked up a wooden stick, struck and killed one of the enemy guards, pushed the enemy's body and the entire cartload of cotton military uniforms and bullets into the Songhua River, and ran back to Heligang. Without a cart, he carried a basket on his back and hid a small axe in his arms, continuing to serve as a liaison for the Anti-Japanese United Army. From Harbin to Shenyang, from Changbai Mountain to the Hinggan Mountains, he traveled all over Northeast China to contact the Anti-Japanese United Army in various places and to protect revolutionary workers. He could find the Anti-Japanese United Army's location in the entire mountainous region of Northeast China and the vast forests. After the Anti-Japanese United Army moved on the mountain, they would leave signs on trees, rocks, or other places. Li Sheng often carried out his task and did not find them on the mountain, but when he saw the signs they left, relying on his familiarity with every road, he found them again. When he could not find them, Li Sheng used his small axe to leave liaison signs on the trees in the areas where the Anti-Japanese United Army might pass, and through these signs, he finally found them. Li Sheng often encountered the enemy in the forests or at road intersections. Like an ordinary peasant carrying his basket, he used his small axe to kill many enemies when they were not prepared. Many cadres dispatched by the Party organization to Northeast China at that time were protected by Li Sheng, posing as his sons and daughters, and led by him to various places. The famous generals of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Feng Zhongyun, and China's immortal daughter Zhao Yiman, were all sent to their work locations by him under his protection. Therefore, the people of Northeast China loved him; while the enemy called him the "Minister of Transportation of the Anti-Japanese United Army" and offered a reward of five thousand silver dollars to capture him.
    In 1939, he was once carrying a letter from the Anti-Japanese United Army in Changbai Mountain to General Zhou Baozhong on the mountain in Yilan County, Songjiang Province. It was snowing that day. He was walking halfway up the mountain when he was arrested by a traitor (formerly a platoon leader in the Anti-Japanese United Army) leading ten enemies. He swallowed the letter that he had not brought along, and then went to the prison in Yilan County. He suffered beatings, being put in iron cages with thorns, and other tortures in prison, but he never revealed any information about the Anti-Japanese United Army to the enemy. Finally, the enemy sentenced him to ten years in prison, and later transferred him from the prison in Yilan to the prison in Hulan, until after the Soviet Red Army liberated Northeast China on "August 15th," he was released from prison. He lived in the enemy's prison for seven years.
    This hero of the Chinese people is eighty-five years old this year. Because of too many past struggles, and because he is very old, he cannot remember many of the past events. But his struggles and experiences have all been recorded in the history of the Chinese people's struggle. This year, on National Day, the people welcomed him to Beijing. He saw with his own eyes the prosperity of the motherland after the victory and the happy life that has been established. That day I saw him at his residence, a tall figure with a snow-white beard. Because he had suffered many tortures in the enemy's prison, his health was very poor. In a comfortable room, he lay quietly on the bed, talking to me about his life of struggle. When he talked about how he had protected Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, and Zhao Yiman in the past, leading them from one place to another, and talking about their sacrifices, he was very sad. "If they hadn't sacrificed, how good it would be now!" he said. "They were all killed by the Japanese invaders and the American imperialists' running dogs – the Kuomintang reactionaries." From the conversation of this old hero and his life experiences, one is reminded of the countless heroes of our motherland and the entire heroic people. We are therefore proud, and we can therefore guarantee the final defeat of all enemies who dare to attack us.

    老英雄李升的经历
    本报记者  白原
    二十年以前，正是“九一八”事变、日本帝国主义侵占东北的时候，六十多岁的老人——李升正赶着自己的一辆大车，在松花江、黑龙江沿岸及兴安岭一带的偏僻小镇和乡村之间，依靠运送邮包来过日子。而在这以前，李升已经过了大半辈子颠沛流离、艰难曲折的生活了。他的老家原在山东的德州。当他二十五岁的那一年，因为家乡发大水，他独自一个人逃灾荒逃到东北，开始当了几年兵，后来又在松江省的方正县向当时的满清政府领了一点荒地来苦苦经营，但是经营了好几年，依然无法维持生活。后来俄国沙皇政府在东北招收修筑铁路的路工，于是他又随着人家到了俄国的边境上替沙皇政府修筑铁路，一直到十月革命爆发的时候。他在那里亲眼看见了十月革命爆发以后的情景。他看见在乡村里农民如何起来推翻地主的统治；在铁路上，工人们如何起来与沙皇政府进行斗争。李升当时也就在铁路上参加了工人们对把头的斗争。以后，因为红军和白匪作战，天天打仗，铁路也破坏了，于是他又回到了东北，在松花江畔靠给人家割稻子、打短工来维持生活。这样又过了好多年。他把自己辛苦积存下来的八十块大洋买了两匹马和一辆大车，继续过着漂流的日子，一直到了“九一八”。
    当时中国共产党东北的党组织到处在秘密地发动和组织人民的革命运动。就在李升赶着大车所来往的小镇和乡村里，他结识了当地的革命工作人员，而且参加了他们所组织的斗争，和他们一起在松江省汤原县的鹤立岗一带组织游击队，发动群众向日本侵略者进行的斗争。不久，游击队到处都组织起来了，并且在共产党的领导下，成立了东北抗日联军。于是李升就接受了组织所交给他的任务，在抗日联军中担任交通工作。他赶着他的一辆大车，一边替人家运送包裹作为掩护，一边为抗日联军送信、送情报，进行联络。有一次日本人把他的大车拉去，让替他们运送军衣及子弹。那正是寒冷的十月天，风呼呼地刮着。他的车上装了满满的一车敌人的棉军服和子弹箱，沿着松花江边走着。乘敌人一个不提防，他拿起一根木棒，一棒把押车的一个敌人打死了，把敌人的尸体和满满的一车棉军衣、子弹连同大车一起推进了松花江里，自己又跑回了鹤立岗。大车没有了，他就背起一个篓篓，怀里藏着一把小小的斧头，继续为抗日联军担任交通工作。从哈尔滨到沈阳，从长白山到兴安岭，他为了与各地的抗日联军进行联络，掩护革命工作人员，跑遍了整个的东北。在整个东北的崇山峻岭，以及广大的密林里，他都能找到抗日联军所在的地方。抗日联军在山上转移以后，就在树上、石头上或者其他地方留下暗号。李升常常带着任务跑到山上碰不到他们，但是一看他们所留下的暗号，凭着他熟悉每一条道路，一找就又找着他们了。在找不着他们的时候，李升就用他的小斧头在抗日联军可能经过的地方，在树木上留下联络的暗号，通过这些暗号，最后又找着他们了。在树林里或者道口上，李升也常常碰到敌人。他好像一个老百姓一样背着他的篓篓，在敌人不防备的时候，他用他的那一把小斧头曾经砍死过好些敌人。当时党的组织在东北所派遣的许多干部，都是在李升的掩护下，称作他的儿女，由他领到各个地方去的。当时东北抗日联军的著名将领杨靖宇、李兆麟、冯仲云，以及中国人民的不朽的女儿赵一曼等，都曾经在他的掩护下，由他送到了工作地点去。因此，东北人民热爱着他；而敌人则把他叫做“抗日联军的交通部长”，悬赏五千块大洋来捉拿他。
    一九三九年，有一次他从长白山的抗日联军中带一封信到松江省依兰县的山上给周保中将军。那一天正下着小雪。他正走在半路的山上，被一个叛徒（原是抗日联军中的一个排长）领着十个敌人逮捕。他把没有带到的信咽到了肚子里，然后进了依兰县的监牢里去。他在监牢里受尽了毒打、蹲带刺的铁笼等等酷刑，但是他始终没有向敌人透露一点关于抗日联军的消息。最后，敌人判了他十年的徒刑，后来又把他从依兰的监牢移到呼兰的监牢里去，一直到“八一五”苏联红军解放东北以后，他才从牢里出来。他在敌人的监牢里生活了七年。
    这一位中国人民的英雄，今年已经八十五岁了。因为过去的斗争经历太多，又因为年纪已经很老，他对许多过去的事情都记不起来了。但是他的那些斗争，那些经历，却已经全部记载在中国人民斗争的历史上。今年国庆节，人民把他迎接到北京。他亲眼看到了胜利以后的祖国的壮大以及已经建立起来的幸福的生活。那一天我在他的住所看见了他，高大的身体，留着雪白的胡子。因为在敌人的监牢里受过许多的酷刑，他的身体很不好。在一间舒适的房子里，他静静地躺在床上，和我谈着他一生斗争的经历。当他谈起过去怎样掩护杨靖宇、李兆麟和赵一曼，从一个地方把他们领到另一个地方去的情形，谈起他们的牺牲的情形，他很难过。“如果他们没有牺牲，现在多好呵！”他说，“他们都是被日寇和美帝国主义的走狗——国民党反动派害死的。”从这一个老英雄的谈话以及他一生的经历，使人想起我们祖国的无数的英雄，以及整个英雄的人民。我们因此而感到光荣，我们因此可以保证最后打败一切敢于向我们进攻的敌人。
