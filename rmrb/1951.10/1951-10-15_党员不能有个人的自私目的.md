    Party Members Cannot Have Selfish Personal Goals

    When Communist Party members in Shangzhan Village, Changzhi, discussed unconditionally obeying the interests of the Party, they revealed how confused some Party members' thinking was. Some Party members even stated that they would "take both public and private interests into account before becoming a Party member" and "sacrificing personal interests requires consideration."

    This is a problem worthy of attention. It shows that some Party members in rural areas have a very vague understanding of communism and the Communist Party, and they join the Party with strong personal motives. The so-called "taking both public and private interests into account" is a typical wrong proposition. Here, these comrades pit personal interests against the interests of the Party, and in fact, under the idea of "taking both into account," they demand that the interests of the Party be subordinate to personal interests. Comrade Shaoqi once pointed out: "The interests of the Party are above all else. This is the highest principle for our Party members." "When the interests of the Party and personal interests conflict, one can unhesitatingly and uncomplainingly obey the interests of the Party and sacrifice oneself… This is a manifestation of the purity of a Party member’s proletarian consciousness.” The personal goals of a Party member must never be independent personal goals that deviate from the interests of the Party. Comrade Shaoqi instructed: "The personal goals of a Party member can only be part of the Party's goals. For example, our Party members want to study Marxist-Leninist theory, strengthen their abilities, and lead the broad masses in victorious revolutionary struggles to establish various revolutionary organizations, etc. If these are personal goals, then they are for the interests of the Party and are also part of the Party's goals. The Party needs many such Party members and cadres, but apart from this, Party members should not have personal status, personal heroism, or other independent personal goals. Because this can make them deviate from the interests of the Party and even engage in speculation within the Party." Those who propose the condition of "taking both public and private interests into account" are clearly violating the above instructions, thus undermining the principles of the Party and lowering the standards for Party members.

### 党员不能有个人的自私目的

    党员不能有个人的自私目的
    长治上湛村共产党员在讨论到无条件服从党的利益时，暴露了某些党员的思想是如何的混乱，有些党员竟表示要“公私兼顾，才当党员”、“牺牲个人利益，还得考虑考虑咧”。
    这是一个值得注意的问题。它说明在农村中有部分党员对共产主义和共产党的认识十分模糊，他们参加党带有强烈的个人目的。所谓“公私兼顾”便是一个典型的错误提法。在这里这些同志把个人利益同党的利益对立起来，实际上是在“兼顾”的思想下要求把党的利益服从个人的利益。少奇同志曾指出：“党的利益高于一切，这是我们党员的最高原则。”“在党的利益与个人利益发生矛盾时，可以毫不踌躇、毫不勉强地服从党的利益，牺牲个人。……这就是党员无产阶级意识的纯洁的表现。”党员的个人目的决不能是离开党的利益的独立的个人目的。少奇同志指示道：“党员个人的目的，只能够是党的部分的目的，如我们的党员要学习马列主义的理论，要加强自己的能力，要去领导广大群众的胜利的革命斗争建立各种革命的组织等，这些如果是个人的目的，那么，这是为了党的利益，也是党的部分目的，党正需要许多这样的党员与干部，但除此以外，党员就不应该有个人地位、个人英雄以及其他等等个人的独立目的。因为这样可以使他离开党的利益，以至走到在党内进行投机。”那种提出“公私兼顾”的条件的人，很显然是违反上述指示的，因而也就破坏了党的原则，降低了党员的标准。
