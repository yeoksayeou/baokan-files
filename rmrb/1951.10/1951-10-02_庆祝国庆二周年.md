    Celebrating the Second Anniversary of National Day
    Chen Qiyou
    The glorious and sacred festival of the second anniversary of the Chinese people’s victorious founding of the nation on October 1st is approaching. Today, people all over our country, and peace-loving and democratic people all over the world, will greet her with great joy! Celebrate her! Because she is not only a festival for the Chinese people to stand up and be their own masters, but also demonstrates that the powerful strength of the people is sufficient to overcome all reactionary forces.
    Looking back over the past two years, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, although it has only been a short time, our achievements are unprecedented and impossible in China's thousands of years of history.
    First, the great movement of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, under correct leadership and with the support of the people of the whole country, has achieved brilliant results in less than a year, shattered the aggression plan of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, and given the people of the world a firm belief in "peace defeating war."
    Second, after two years of efforts, the nationwide land reform work has been completed in areas with more than 300 million agricultural population, including the past, and is being promoted in the uncompleted areas. Land reform has enabled our country's farmers to turn over from the thousands of years of feudal oppression, gain land, freedom and happiness, and lay an unshakable foundation for the industrialization of our country.
    Third, after the government issued clear instructions to vigorously and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, thanks to the joint efforts of the government and the people, the hidden remnants of imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, and the local bullies produced under feudalism, have been eradicated. So that every kind person in the country has been liberated from the terror of these bandits and secret agents.
    We should be more aware that the gains of the three major movements are not only here. Through the victorious process of the three major movements, we have gained more valuable results. In the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, we have raised the patriotism and internationalism of the people throughout the country; in the land reform movement, we not only overthrew the feudal system, but also gradually eliminated the feudal ideology generated by this declining feudal system; in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the democratic parties and people of all strata in our country have united more closely; the Tibetan compatriots, who have been oppressed by imperialism and Han chauvinism for a long time, have also been peacefully liberated, thus unifying the entire continent; Under this close unity, it is clear that wherever our five-star red flag is planted, there is no room for any imperialist aggression forces and the remnants of their lackeys.
    In terms of construction, our achievements in the past two years are also numerous. We will only list a few of the biggest ones. The prices that were unbearable under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang were initially stabilized nationwide in less than half a year after the establishment of the People's Government, and then the initial improvement of the entire national financial economy was achieved. Another example is the "Huai River Disaster," which has always been famous in Chinese history. Under Chairman Mao's instruction to "repair the Huai River well," the first phase of this great project has been gradually completed in the past year. Other construction in cultural education and other aspects has also made extraordinary achievements with rapid progress.
    Brand new China! Brand new construction! These are what imperialism, especially American imperialism, does not want to see, and will inevitably use various methods to destroy us. The US-Japan peace treaty signed at the San Francisco Conference on September 8th is an attempt by the imperialists to deprive the people of our country of the fruits of victory in the Anti-Japanese War, and attempt to use this to arm Japan as his pawns to invade our country. Recently, American imperialism has again used its rogue tactics to unreasonably obstruct the Korean negotiations, fully exposing the wolf's ambition. All of this is what we cannot forget today and must strengthen our vigilance. However, the Chinese people, who have stood up, have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and are absolutely not afraid of any imperialist conspiracies and threats. We have full confidence that we can rely on our strength to advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong! Oppose aggression! Oppose war! Defend peace!
    We shout:
    Long live the victory of the war to Resist America and Aid Korea and oppose aggression!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

    庆祝国庆二周年
    陈其尤
    十月一日中国人民胜利建国二周年的光荣圣神的节日来临了。在今天，我们全国各地的人民，以及全世界各国爱好和平民主的人民都将以万分欢悦来迎接她！庆祝她！因为她不仅是我们中国人民从此翻身作主人的节日，同时，她也说明了强大的人民力量是足够战胜一切反动力量的。
    回顾两年来，我们的政府在毛主席及中国共产党的英明领导之下，虽然还只有短短的时间，然而我们的成就却是中国几千年历史中所从来未有的，亦是不可能有的。
    第一、抗美援朝的伟大运动，在正确的领导和全国人民支援之下，不到一年，我们已获得了辉煌的成果，打碎了以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略计划，使全世界人民对“和平战胜战争”有了铁的信念。
    第二、全国的土地改革工作，经过了两年的努力，连过去在内，已在三亿多的农业人口地区完成，并正在未完成地区推进。土地改革使我全国农民在几千年封建重压之下翻过身来，获得了土地、自由与幸福，并为我国工业化前途奠定了不可动摇的基础。
    第三、在政府大张旗鼓坚决镇压反革命的明确指示颁布以后，由于政府与人民的共同努力，已将潜伏的帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的土匪特务残余，和封建主义下产生的恶霸，拔除殆尽。使全国每个善良的人民从这些土匪特务们的恐怖之中解放了出来。
    我们更应该明了三大运动的收获不仅在此。通过三大运动的胜利过程，我们获得了更宝贵的胜利成果。在抗美援朝运动中，我们提高了全国人民的爱国主义与国际主义思想；在土地改革运动中，我们不仅推翻了封建制度，也逐渐铲除了由这一没落的封建制度所产生的封建思想；在镇压反革命运动中，我全国各民主党派，各阶层的人民，已更进一层地团结起来了；长期在帝国主义和大汉族主义压迫之下的西藏同胞，也获得和平解放，因而使整个大陆都统一起来了；在这种紧密团结之下，很明显地，凡是我们五星红旗插到的地方，是不可能有任何帝国主义的侵略势力以及其走狗帮凶们的残余力量存在的余地。
    在建设方面，我们两年来的成就，也是不胜枚举的。我们只举其最大的几项。在国民党反动统治下不堪收拾的物价，在人民政府成立不到半年，即获得了全国物价的初步平稳，进而获得了整个国家财政经济的初步好转。又如一直是中国历史上著名的“淮祸”，在毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的指示下，一年来已逐步地完成了这一伟大工程的第一期的任务。其他如文化教育各方面的建设，也都在突飞猛进而有了超乎平常的成绩。
    崭新的中国！崭新的建设！这些都是帝国主义尤其是美帝国主义所不愿意有的，必然地要以种种方法来破坏我们。九月八日旧金山会议所签订的美制对日和约，就是帝国主义者借着来剥夺我全国人民抗日战争的胜利果实，企图借此武装日本来作他侵略我国的爪牙。最近美帝国主义又在使用其流氓手段，无理地阻挠朝鲜的谈判，充分暴露了狼子的野心。所有这一切，都是我们在今天所不能忘记而要加强警惕的。然而我们已经站起来的中国人民有了英明的领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导，是绝对不怕任何帝国主义者的阴谋和威胁的。我们有充分的信心，可以依靠我们的力量，在毛泽东的旗帜之下胜利前进！反对侵略！反对战争！保卫和平！
    我们高呼：
    抗美援朝反侵略战争胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
