Since the State Council of the Central People's Government passed the "Provisional Measures on Abolishing the Feudal Head Porter System in Various Regions" on March 24, 1950, the broad masses of porters across the country, under the correct leadership of the local Communist Party committees, have successively launched a struggle to abolish the feudal head porter system in the porterage industry, carrying out a massive reform movement in the porterage industry. According to statistics from 432 cities, a total of 800,449 workers were involved. As of the end of September, 177 cities with 588,391 workers (accounting for 73.6% of the total number of workers) had abolished the feudal head porter system; 27 cities with 90,515 workers (accounting for 11.4% of the total number of workers) were in the process of abolishing the feudal head porter system. Thirteen cities with 15,191 workers (accounting for 1.8% of the total number of workers) had carried out the struggle to abolish the feudal head porter system, but it was not thorough and still needs to be deepened; eighteen cities with 20,379 workers (accounting for 2.5% of the total number of workers) had not yet carried out the work of abolishing the feudal head porter system. The feudal head porters were stained with the blood of the workers. They had always cruelly exploited the workers, oppressing, extorting, raping, and killing them by any means possible. The people's governments at all levels, accepting the demands of the broad masses of porters, have dealt with some of the head porters according to the severity of their crimes. After more than a year of struggle, the broad masses of workers have been liberated and are full of pride. The workers said, "The ancient tree has blossomed; we workers are now masters of our own house!"

Establishing Porterage Companies Promotes the Exchange of Goods
    Due to the past control and monopoly of the porterage industry by feudal head porters, and the scattered and mobile nature of the workers, extremely unreasonable phenomena have formed in the porterage industry. In particular, high porterage fees and complicated procedures have affected the country's economic construction and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In the movement to abolish the feudal head porter system and reform the porterage industry, all localities have followed the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government to establish new porterage organizations—porterage companies. According to existing statistics, porterage companies have been established in 124 large and medium-sized cities. These porterage companies, under the guidance of the local people's governments and with the support of the broad masses of porters, have made many achievements in the past year, although there are still many problems that need to be solved. For example, after abolishing the feudal head porters, they implemented unified freight rates, solving the chaotic phenomena of inconsistent freight rates within a city, "a cup of tea to enter the warehouse, a peck of rice to leave the warehouse," bargaining, and rampant lies. Fifty-seven cities across the country have now implemented unified freight rates, unified consignment, and unified allocation of labor; other cities are also carrying out this work. In these cities where feudal head porters have been abolished, not only have they eliminated the complicated procedures in the porterage process (such as 33 types of fees at the Taikoo Wharf in Shanghai, seven procedures for importing and exporting goods, and six types of workers; wharves in Wuhan divided the work into 21 types, such as picking, lifting, ramming, stacking, unloading, loading cabins, and customs clearance; goods in Bengbu had to go through 13 procedures, such as top gear, lighterage, digging warehouses, and rushing buckets, and had to be handled by four types of people to be transferred from the ship to the warehouse), extortion, theft, sabotage, and the use of hand hooks; but also, they have carried out multiple adjustments to the extremely unreasonable "foot power" and "thousand-mile boat money, inch-step foot money" left over by the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal head porters, gradually making freight rates fair and reasonable. For example, before the abolition of the feudal head porter system in Tianjin, the freight rate for medicinal materials was 2.12 jin of corn flour per 100 jin, which has now been changed to 9.6 liang, a reduction of 80%; other reductions were at least 31%. Before the abolition of head porters in Bengbu, the freight rate for 200 jin of grain was 9 jin of white flour, which has now been changed to 1.10 jin, a reduction of 82%; other general freight rates have also been reduced by 60%. In Chongqing, the freight rate for loading and unloading 300 jin of cigarettes has been reduced from 2.4 dou of rice to 2.25 sheng, a reduction of 90%; other average reductions are 40%. In Wuhan, the freight rate for sewing bags of grain per ton was formerly 33.12 jin of rice, which has now been reduced to 2.10 jin, a reduction of 91%; other freight rates have been reduced by at least 30%. After the freight rate adjustment, not only has it facilitated the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, but it has also increased workers' wages. For example, before the freight rate adjustment in Bengbu, the average daily income of porters was 6,000 yuan; after the freight rate adjustment, the average daily income per person was 10,000 yuan. Before the freight rate adjustment in Tianjin, the average daily income per person was 3 to 6 jin of corn flour; after the freight rate adjustment, the average daily income per person was 20.12 jin of corn flour. Before the freight rate adjustment in Handan Town, the average daily income per person was 17,382 yuan; after the freight rate adjustment, the average daily income per person was 20,980 yuan.

Workers Establish New Labor Attitudes
    After the porters were freed from the rule and exploitation of the feudal head porters, their class consciousness was greatly enhanced, and phenomena such as theft, damage, extortion, and blackmail have gradually disappeared. They have begun to establish new labor attitudes, constantly improving labor efficiency, improving operating methods, improving labor tools, and automatically assisting the people's government in collecting taxes and reporting illegal acts by illegal merchants. During the typhoon that hit Shanghai in August, the porters of Shanghai disregarded their personal losses and rescued more than 130,000 items worth over 190 billion yuan from damage. Huang Zhuo and five other dockworkers in Guangzhou refused to accept bribes from merchants and reported the smuggling of more than 400 watches. Workers in Wanxian, Wushan, and Hechuan counties in eastern Sichuan reported 131 cases of smuggled and tax-evaded goods in three months. Instances of tricycle workers returning lost money have become commonplace. According to incomplete statistics from five grassroots trade unions of tricycle workers in Tianjin alone, they have returned lost money (tens of millions of yuan and valuables) 113 times, arrested bandits 15 times, and reported tax evasion 24 times in the past year. The theft losses at Taikoo Wharf in Shanghai alone amounted to 34.38 billion yuan in January and February of 1950. Now, such losses have almost completely disappeared. In terms of operation, workers in Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Tianjin, Chongqing, Qingdao, and other cities have consciously risen up to abolish the use of hand hooks. The workers said, "Let the hand hooks die with the feudal head porters." They created more than 40 new tools such as "immortal hooks," "male and female hooks," and "basket hooks," greatly reducing the loss of state property. The Wuhan Cotton Yarn Cloth Company reduced losses by more than 600 million yuan last year because workers did not use hand hooks. After Yuan Yuqing, a worker in Tianjin, improved the operating method, the number of rubber materials transported by 12 people in eight hours increased from 344 pieces to 672 pieces by six people in eight hours, reducing the labor force by half and increasing work efficiency by more than two times. In the past, workers at Xibianmen in Beijing would produce 1,000 to 2,000 broken bricks when unloading a trainload of bricks, but now they only produce about 100 bricks; in the past, they would produce 20 to 30 broken bags when unloading cement, but now they only produce 7 to 8 bags. With the improvement of workers' awareness and the improvement of operating methods, work efficiency is also constantly improving. For example, the Zhou Chengyu team of porters in Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, increased the number of vehicles loaded and unloaded with public grain from 15 to 34 per day.

Porters Actively Participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign
    After U.S. imperialism launched a war of aggression against our neighboring country Korea, the porters took practical actions to carry out the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, organizing pickets and self-defense teams to protect warehouses and docks; and actively participating in volunteer transportation service teams to Korea, public security forces, and people's police, voluntarily donating vehicles and horses to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in opposing the U.S. imperialist war of aggression. For example, in Shanghai alone, 1,921 people joined the people's police, 205 people joined the public security forces, and 94 truck drivers joined the transportation service team; Wang Bangjie, a cart driver in the Resist America, Aid Korea transportation team of porters in Harbin, was willing to postpone his marriage and requested to go to Korea to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Under his influence, more than 300 vehicles participated in transportation. As a result, the two-month transportation task was completed in 45 days.

    After the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued three major calls, the porters in various places responded more enthusiastically to these calls and generally formulated patriotic pacts. According to incomplete statistics from 63 cities, 165,388 workers have signed patriotic pacts, accounting for 52.54% of the total number of porters in those areas. After signing patriotic pacts, the work efficiency of porters in various places has further improved. For example, in Wuhu, the work that used to take 128 people eight hours to unload 4,000 bags of rice can now be completed by 80 people in six hours. Workers in Jiujiang transported public grain in Hukou, completing a three-month plan in one and a half months, and ensuring that the public grain did not suffer any damage.

    Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party committees and people's governments at all levels, and on the basis of the improved political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of porters after the movements of abolishing feudal head porters, resisting America and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the reform work of the porterage industry has made remarkable achievements. We should summarize these achievements and experiences to consolidate them. In the future, we should continue to rely closely on the Communist Party committees and local people's governments at all levels, rely on the broad masses of workers, unite as one, and conscientiously push the work further forward.

    数十万搬运工人进行反封建斗争
    百七十余城市废除搬运把头制度
    自从一九五○年三月二十四日中央人民政府政务院通过了“关于废除各地搬运事业中封建把持制度暂行处理办法”之后，全国广大搬运工人群众，在各地共产党党委的正确领导之下，先后开展了废除搬运事业中封建把头制度的斗争，在搬运事业中进行了巨大的改革运动。根据四百三十二个城市的材料统计，共有工人八十万零四百四十九人。截至九月底，已有一百七十七个城市，工人五十八万八千三百九十一人（占工人总数的百分之七十三点六）的地区废除了封建把头制度；有二十七个城市，工人九万零五百一十五人（占工人总数的百分之十一点四）的地区正在进行废除封建把头的斗争。有十三个城市，工人一万五千一百九十一人（占工人总数的百分之一点八）虽然进行了废除封建把头制度的斗争，但不彻底，仍须继续深入一步；有十八个城市，工人二万零三百七十九人（占工人总数的百分之二点五）还没有进行废除封建把头的工作。封建把头染满了工人的血迹，他们从来就残酷地剥削工人，对工人欺压、敲诈、强奸、杀害，无所不用其极。各地人民政府接受广大搬运工人群众的要求，对一些把头，已按犯罪大小分别处理了。经过年余来的斗争，广大工人翻身了，扬眉吐气了。工人们说：“千年古树开了花，咱们工人当了家。”建立搬运公司促进物资交流
    由于过去搬运事业为封建把头所把持垄断，和工人分散流动等情形，形成搬运事业中极不合理的现象。特别是搬运费高与手续繁杂，影响到国家的经济建设，城乡物资的交流。各地在废除封建把头制度改革搬运事业的运动中，都按照中央人民政府政务院的指示，建立起新的搬运组织——搬运公司。根据现有材料统计，已在一百二十四个大、中城市建立起搬运公司。这些搬运公司，在当地人民政府的指导和广大搬运工人的拥护与积极支持下，虽然仍有不少问题须努力解决，但年余来已做出很多成绩。如继废除封建把头之后，进行了统一运价，解决了一个城市内运费不一、“进栈一杯茶、出栈一斗米”、讨价还价、满天要谎的混乱现象。全国现有五十七个城市实现了统一运价，统一承运与统一调配劳动力；其他城市也正在进行这一工作。在这些废除封建把头的城市中，不但废除了搬运过程中的手续繁杂（如上海市太古码头有三十三种费用，进出货物要七道手续，六种工人做；武汉市码头将工作划分为挑、抬、夯、堆、下、装舱、打关等二十一种；蚌埠市的货物由船上卸入仓库，要经过顶档、驳运、挖仓、冲斗等十三道手续，要换四种人干活）、敲诈勒索、偷窃破坏、使用手钩等恶习；而且对国民党反动派、封建把头遗留下来的极不合理的“脚力”、“千里船钱，寸步脚钱”，进行了多次的调整工作，使运价逐步地走向公平合理。如天津市未废除封建把头制度前，药材每百斤运价玉米面二斤十二两，现改为九两六，降低了百分之八十；其他最少降低百分之三十一。蚌埠市废除把头之前，二百斤粮食运价为白面九斤，现改为一斤十两，降低了百分之八十二，其他一般运价亦降低了百分之六十。重庆市三百斤香烟的提装运价由二斗四升米降为二升二合五，降低了百分之九十；其他平均降低为百分之四十。武汉市从前每吨粮食缝包运价为三十三斤十二两米，现减为二斤十两，减低百分之九十一；其他运价最少降低百分之三十。运价调整后，不仅便利了城乡物资交流，而且增加了工人工资收入。如蚌埠市运价未调整前搬运工人每人每日平均收入六千元；调整运价后，每人每日平均收入一万元。天津市未调整运价前每人每日平均收入玉米面三斤到六斤；调整运价后，每人每日平均收入玉米面二十斤十二两。邯郸镇未调整运价前每人每日平均收入一万七千三百八十二元；运价调整后，每人每日平均收入二万零九百八十元。
    工人树立新的劳动态度
    搬运工人在废除封建把头的统治、剥削之后，阶级觉悟大为提高，盗窃、损坏、敲诈、勒索等现象已渐行绝迹，开始树立了新的劳动态度，不断地提高劳动效率，改进操作方法，改良劳动工具，并自动协助人民政府进行税收和检举不法商人的违法行为。上海市搬运工人在八月台风侵袭上海时，不顾个人的损失，抢救了十三万余件价值一千九百余亿元的物资免遭损失。广州市码头工人黄卓等六人，拒收商人贿赂，检举走私偷运的手表四百余个。川东万县、巫山、合川等县工人，三个月检举走私漏税货物达一百三十一件。三轮车工人拾金不昧者已屡见不鲜，仅天津市三轮车工人五个基层工会年余来不完全的统计，拾金（数千万元及贵重物品）归还者一百一十三次，逮捕盗匪十五次，检举漏税二十四次。上海市太古码头仅以偷窃损失一项，按一九五○年一、二月计算，即达到三百四十三亿八千万元之巨，现在已几乎完全没有这种损失了。在操作方面，上海、北京、武汉、天津、重庆、青岛等城市，工人自觉地起来废除使用手钩，工人说：“让手钩与封建把头一齐死亡。”他们创造了“神仙钩”、“公母钩”、“箩子钩”等四十多种新工具，大大地减少了国家财产的损失。武汉市花纱布公司因工人不用手钩，去年一年减少了六亿多元的损失。天津市工人袁玉清改进操作方法后，搬运胶皮料子由过去十二人八小时三百四十四块提高为六人八小时六百七十二块，劳动力减少一半，工作效率提高到二倍多。北京市西便门工人过去卸一火车砖要出一两千块碎砖，现在只出一百块左右；过去卸洋灰要出二、三十个破袋，现在只出七、八个。随着工人觉悟的提高，操作方法的改进，工作效率亦不断地提高，如浙江省丽水县搬运工人周成钰小组，运输公粮中装卸汽车由每日装十五辆提高到三十四辆。
    搬运工人积极参加抗美援朝工作
    美帝国主义发动侵略我们邻邦朝鲜的战争后，搬运工人即以实际的行动进行抗美援朝的工作，组织纠察队、自卫队，保卫仓库、码头；并积极地参加赴朝志愿运输服务队、公安部队、人民警察，自愿献出车、马，支援中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军，反对美帝国主义的侵略战争。如上海市一地就有一千九百二十一人参加人民警察，二百零五人参加公安部队，九十四名卡车工人参加运输服务队；哈尔滨市搬运工人抗美援朝运输队大车工人王邦杰愿暂不结婚，要求赴朝鲜支援中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军。在他的影响下，有三百多台车参加运输。结果，两个月运输任务，四十五天就完成了。
    抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，各地搬运工人更热烈地响应了这一号召，普遍订立了爱国公约。根据六十三个城市不完全的统计，订立爱国公约的工人有十六万五千三百八十八人，占各该地搬运工人总数的百分之五十二点五四。各地搬运工人在订立爱国公约后，工作效率进一步提高。如芜湖市过去一百二十八人八小时卸四千包米的工作，现在八十人六小时完成。九江市工人在湖口搬运公粮，三个月的计划一个半月完成，并使公粮没有遭受一点损失。
    在各地共产党党委、各级人民政府的正确领导下，在广大搬运工人经过废除封建把头、抗美援朝、镇压反革命的运动，政治觉悟与劳动热情提高的基础上，搬运事业的改革工作，做出了显著的成绩，这些成绩和经验我们应该总结起来巩固下去。今后仍应紧紧地依靠各地共产党、各地人民政府，依靠广大的工人群众，团结一致，兢兢业业地把工作再向前推进一步。
