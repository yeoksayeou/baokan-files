New People and New Things in New China
    Workers of the Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station, Xu Guiqin and others,
    Successfully Created an "Automatic Wiring Battery Box"
    Editor: Workers of the Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station, Xu Guiqin, and others, successfully created an "automatic wiring battery box" for dry-cell radios during the patriotic production movement. This invention initially solved the serious problem of radio operators connecting wires incorrectly when using dry-cell radios, which could burn out vacuum tubes. It plays a certain role in developing the people's broadcasting事业, expanding political propaganda, and reducing the loss of state wealth. Xu Guiqin and the workers of the service department wanted to create an automatic wiring battery box to protect the safety of vacuum tubes. Therefore, he was constantly thinking about how to make it successful and reduce unnecessary losses to the country. This spirit of hard work received strong support from the leaders of the department, and after constantly overcoming material difficulties, they finally succeeded in creating it. Xu Guiqin excitedly said at the general staff meeting: "The new China is a country led by our working class. The property of the country is our own property, and we cannot allow it to be lost in the slightest. In order to strengthen the effort to resist America and aid Korea, and to develop the country's economic construction, I should contribute everything I have. My little achievement today is the result of the collective creation of all comrades. I hope that everyone will continue to develop the spirit of collective mutual assistance in the future."

    At the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition,
    A Public Telephone Without Management Appeared
    Editor: I saw a fresh thing at the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition. In the resting shed of the exhibition, there was a public telephone booth without management. There was a small green wooden box hanging there, with the words "Payment Box" written on it, and instructions: "Make a call, pay yourself, 400 yuan each time." Next to the wooden box was a beautiful telephone. I saw workers, students, and citizens constantly making calls there, and their faces showed a kind of comfort and joy. After finishing the call, they naturally put the call fee into the "Payment Box."

    People who have been to Beijing all know that there is an "Unmanned Bookstore" in Beijing Railway Station, where passengers buy books themselves and pay themselves; the books are not messed up, and the money is not short. But in the resting shed of this conference, I saw an unmanaged public telephone that could be compared with the "Unmanned Bookstore." These fresh facilities not only save manpower in operation, but also specifically and powerfully illustrate the beautiful order of the new society. Such things would have been impossible in the old society. This unmanaged public telephone has been praised by many visitors at the conference.

    Huang Keqin of Zhengzhou Telecommunications Bureau
    Made No Mistakes in Eight Months
    After I participated in the movement to eliminate errors and reduce accidents, from May to the end of December last year, I handled a total of 12,320 telegrams, totaling more than 490,000 words in four groups of codes. Because I put all my energy into production work, not only did I not make a single mistake, but I also eliminated 454 mistakes made by users and senders. Therefore, at the end of last year, I was rated as a first-class labor model of the bureau and a third-class labor model of the city. On March 12th this year, I was honored to be rated as a third-class labor model of the province and attended the first labor model representative conference of the Henan Postal and Telecommunications District Trade Union.

    People Along the Jiyun River Overcome Drought
    Organized to Draw Water for Irrigation of 240,000 Mu
    Editor: This year, due to little rain in the autumn, the land in the low-lying areas along the Jiyun River in Hebei has cracked into seams, which not only makes it impossible to sow autumn wheat, but also makes it difficult to sow large fields next spring. To this end, the Ji-Luan River Affairs Bureau convened a consultation meeting on irrigation on October 13th, involving the three special districts of Tangshan, Tongxian, and Tianjin, and the three counties of Yutian, Jixian, and Baodi. The relevant special districts, counties, and the River Affairs Bureau formed an irrigation committee to carry out irrigation work in a planned, organized, and led manner. The plan is to use all the water from the Xun River (a tributary of the Jiyun River) to irrigate the Dazhongzhuang low-lying area in Baodi. A dirt dam will be built at the old Gaozhai of the Xun River channel to force the water level higher and release water into the low-lying area by breaking the right bank. The water volume of the Zhou River is for use by Jixian and Yutian counties. It is estimated that the damming project will be completed on October 27th, and the three low-lying areas can irrigate a total of 240,000 mu of land from October 28th to November 23rd (Minor Snow), with 120,000 mu planted with wheat, which can produce a total of 6 million jin of wheat, calculated at 50 jin per mu; and 120,000 mu planted with large fields, which can increase the production of red sorghum by a total of 6 million jin, calculated at 50 jin per mu.

    山西人民广播电台工人续贵琴等
    创制“自动接线电池箱”成功编辑同志：山西人民广播电台工人续贵琴等，在爱国生产运动中，创制干电池收音机“自动接线电池箱”成功。这一创造初步解决了收音员们在使用干电池收音机时把线接错，烧毁真空管的严重问题，为发展人民的广播事业、扩大政治宣传和减少国家财富的损失起了一定的作用。续贵琴和该服务部的工人为了要制造一个自动接线的电池箱，保护真空管的安全，因此，他随时随地都在想怎样把它制造成功，为国家减少不必要的损失。这种苦钻精神，得到了该部领导干部的有力支持；因而在不断地克服材料困难后，终于创制成功。续贵琴在全体职工大会上激动地说：“新中国是咱们工人阶级领导的国家。国家的财产就是自己的财产，我们不能让它有丝毫损失。为了增强抗美援朝的力量，为了发展国家的经济建设，我应当贡献出自己的一切。我今天这点成就，是全体同志集体创造的结果，我希望今后大家继续发挥集体互助的精神。”

    华北城乡物资交流展览会上
    出现了无人管理的公用电话编辑同志：在华北城乡物资交流展览会上，我看见了一件新鲜的事情。在展览会的休息棚里，有一个无人管理的公用电话处。那儿挂有一个绿色的小木箱，上面写着“纳费箱”字样，还有说明：“打通电话，自己付费，每次四百元”。在木箱旁边放着一架漂亮的电话机。我看见不断地有工人、学生和市民在那里打电话，他们的脸上都表现出一种安适和愉快的神情。打完了电话，又那么自然地把通话费放到“纳费箱”里去。
    到过北京的人，都知道北京车站设有“无人售书处”，旅客自己买书，自己付款；书不乱，钱也不少。而在这个大会的休息棚里，我却看到了可以与“无人售书处”媲美的无人管理的公用电话。这些新鲜的设施，不仅在经营上节省了人力，而且，它具体和有力地说明了新社会的美好秩序。像这样的事情，在旧社会里是不可能有的。这个没有人管理的公用电话，在大会上受到了很多参观者的称赞。

    八个月未出一个差错
    我参加了消灭差错减少事故运动后，自去年五月至十二月底止，八个月中一共经办电报一万二千三百二十张，计四组电码四十九万多字。由于我把全副精力用到了生产工作中去，所以不但没出一个差错，而且还消灭了用户及发电人的四百五十四次差错。因而，在去年年终被评为全局一等劳动模范及全市三等劳动模范。今年三月十二日我又荣幸地被评为全省三等工作模范，并出席河南邮电区工会首届劳动模范代表大会。
