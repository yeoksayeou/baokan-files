Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 18th: Soviet newspapers published the Soviet government's statement to the U.S. government regarding the Korean situation and Soviet-U.S. relations. On October 5th, U.S. Ambassador Kirk visited Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, on behalf of the U.S. government, to present an oral statement regarding the Korean situation and Soviet-U.S. relations. On October 15th, Vyshinsky met with Mr. Coe, the acting chargé d'affaires of the United States, who was acting for the absent Ambassador in Moscow, and presented him with the following statement. The original statement was delivered to Mr. Coe.

"On October 5th, at the request of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Kirk, I met with Mr. Kirk. He said: He wished to discuss the issue of improving relations between our two countries. The ambassador said that he was instructed by the U.S. government to request that the Soviet government be notified of the statement he was ordered to make on this issue, and requested that Marshal Stalin personally pay attention to it. Afterwards, the ambassador read a lengthy statement of seven or eight pages.

When I expressed the hope to obtain the original text of this statement, to my surprise, the ambassador said that according to the instructions he received, he could only present this statement orally and could not leave a written original.

I. The content of Mr. Kirk's statement can be roughly summarized as follows:

A. The statement read by Mr. Kirk pointed out that the Korean issue is currently the most acute and dangerous international issue that needs to be resolved immediately. The U.S. government attaches great importance to the Korean armistice negotiations, believing that a good outcome of the armistice negotiations would make it possible to resolve other outstanding issues that contribute to international tensions, and would open up prospects for improving Soviet-U.S. relations. The ambassador said that the U.S. government hopes that the Soviet government will help bring the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion. While appealing to the Soviet government for assistance, Mr. Kirk made rather strange insinuations, implying that if the outcome of these negotiations is unfavorable, it may create 'adverse effects' between the Soviet Union and the United States.

The ambassador also said that the U.S. Command objects to discussing the issue of determining the ceasefire line in Kaesong, believing it to be a political issue.

B. The statement also noted Soviet-U.S. relations, insisting that democratic countries, that is, what the ambassador called the 'communist bloc,' have not shown a willingness to resolve international outstanding issues, attempting to shift the responsibility for creating international tensions onto democratic countries. The statement also insisted that the Soviet Union adheres to an irreconcilable attitude on many international issues, and that this attitude makes the United States and other countries uneasy.

Mr. Kirk also assured that the measures currently being taken by the U.S. government in the military field have no aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union and other countries, and their purpose is only for self-defense. He was formally declaring this on the orders of his government.

II. Mr. Kirk mainly discussed two issues in his oral statement – the Korean situation and Soviet-U.S. relations.

The Soviet government attaches great importance to these issues, and therefore, it is necessary to state the following:

A. Regarding the Korean situation. It can be seen from Mr. Kirk's statement that the U.S. government is concerned about the situation in Korea and the progress of the armistice negotiations. This concern is entirely understandable because, as everyone knows, the U.S. government, after launching a war of aggression against the Korean people, is in a position that makes it worry about the outcome of its military gamble in Korea.

However, the ambassador's statement that the U.S. government is striving for the smooth completion of the Kaesong negotiations is inconsistent with the policy pursued by the U.S. government on this issue. The U.S. government has systematically rejected all the proposals made to it for a genuine peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, namely: immediately stop the war of aggression in Korea, withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, and resolve the entire Korean issue by peaceful means.

Regarding this point, it is necessary to draw the U.S. government's attention to the Soviet Union's efforts to achieve the smooth completion of the Kaesong negotiations and the end of the Korean War.

It was not the U.S. government, nor the United Nations, but the Soviet government that initiated the peaceful settlement of the Korean War. As early as the beginning of July 1950, Stalin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, advocated a rapid solution to the Korean War through the Security Council.

At the Fifth United Nations General Assembly in 1950, the Soviet government also proposed the immediate peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the simultaneous withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea. Finally, in June 1951, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, put forward a proposal recommending that the belligerent parties hold negotiations on the cessation of hostilities and the armistice, and that both sides withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel as the first step towards a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

As for the ambassador's assertion that the delay in the Kaesong negotiations was caused by the attitude of the North Korean army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army headquarters, it is completely unfounded. As everyone knows, the U.S.-British army command in Korea systematically created various obstacles to hinder the smooth progress of the negotiations, and did not hesitate to create various incidents that General Ridgway used to complicate the negotiations. The real reason for the delay in the Kaesong negotiations is precisely these obstacles created by the U.S. Command.

The best way to ensure a good outcome of the armistice negotiations is to instruct General Ridgway not to complicate the negotiations with various incidents, and not to create artificial obstacles with meaningless disputes, such as disputes over moving the negotiations from Kaesong to another location.

Regarding what the ambassador said about the line where the troops of both sides would be stationed after the cessation of hostilities, the Soviet government believes that this issue is organically linked to the issue of the cessation of hostilities, and therefore, this issue cannot be circumvented in the armistice negotiations.

The Soviet government believes that there is no need to discuss the ambassador's statement about the arbitrary words of the aggressive actions within South Korea, because the defamatory nature of such arbitrary words has been irrefutably proven before.

According to the ambassador's statement, the U.S. government hopes that the Soviet government will help bring the Kaesong negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion. However, as everyone knows, the Soviet government is not a party to the negotiations. On the contrary, the U.S. government is a party to the negotiations, and therefore, it is precisely it that can take steps to ensure the smooth completion of the negotiations. Needless to say, any genuine effort in this direction will, at present, as in the past, receive the full and vigorous support of the Soviet Union.

B. Regarding Soviet-U.S. relations. The ambassador said that the U.S. government authorized him to bring to the attention of the Soviet government and Marshal Stalin himself the need to improve relations between our two countries. The ambassador also pointed out that, in this regard, as in resolving other international outstanding issues, a good conclusion to the Korean armistice negotiations has a huge role to play.

Of course, in order to improve the international situation, it is urgently necessary to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The Soviet government has also repeatedly attempted to reach an understanding with the United States on other important issues in Soviet-U.S. relations and other unresolved, most important international issues, such as taking measures to facilitate the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, democratic, and independent Germany and concluding a peace treaty with Germany, the issue of concluding peace with Japan, the issue of unconditionally banning atomic weapons and establishing strict international control, the issue of stopping the arms race and disarmament, the issue of banning war propaganda, and the issue of concluding a peace pact.

At the initiative of the Soviet government, a meeting of foreign ministers' deputies was held in Paris in 1951 to discuss the German issue and other important international issues. The Soviet Union suggested that a number of urgent issues be included in the agenda of the foreign ministers' conference that was being considered at the time, including important issues such as the Atlantic Treaty and U.S. military bases in Europe and the Near East. However, this suggestion was rejected by the U.S. government, as well as the British and French governments.

If the U.S. government truly advocates improving Soviet-U.S. relations and eliminating differences on the aforementioned important international issues, and if it truly advocates peace, it has many opportunities to prove through action that it has the peaceful intentions stated in the U.S. government's statement. However, as everyone knows, the U.S. government has not done so.

C. Mr. Kirk said that the United States of America has no aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union and other countries, and is striving to improve relations between our two countries.

This is not the first time the U.S. government has made such a statement. In this regard, it should be recalled the letter from U.S. President Truman to Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, as well as the joint resolution of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. These documents also contain statements of this nature. However, this did not prevent the U.S. government from simultaneously abolishing the U.S.-Soviet trade agreement that had been in effect from 1937 until recently, nor did it prevent the U.S. government from passing a law under the pretext of so-called strategic reasons, prohibiting any financial or economic so-called 'assistance' to countries that export goods to the Soviet Union and countries friendly to the Soviet Union, nor did it prevent the U.S. government from taking other measures aimed at severing economic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

The statement read by Mr. Kirk also said: The measures currently being taken by the U.S. government in the military field are only for defense purposes and have no aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union and other countries. However, this statement contradicts the actions of the United States; the actions of the United States show that what the U.S. government is concerned about is by no means maintaining peace. This is not only manifested in the war against the Korean people, but also in the establishment of the aggressive Atlantic bloc against the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, in the remilitarization of Germany and Japan, in the expansion of the arms race, in the establishment of many U.S. military bases around the Soviet Union, etc.

D. The Soviet government cannot ignore what the ambassador said: If the Kaesong negotiations do not produce positive results, it will produce 'adverse consequences,' and there will also be 'adverse effects' between our two countries. First of all, one can ask: What does the U.S. government mean by 'adverse consequences' or 'adverse effects'? If it refers to the issue that Soviet-U.S. relations may further deteriorate, then after President Truman told the world that an agreement with the Soviet Union is not worth a scrap of paper, it is almost impossible to imagine that relations between the two countries could deteriorate further. In this case, can one take seriously the statement of willingness to improve Soviet-U.S. relations? Is it not more accurate to say that the U.S. government is not in fact working to improve Soviet-U.S. relations and cooperate with the Soviet Union, but is only happy to talk about cooperation and agreements?

However, the Soviet government, in accordance with its peaceful policy, tirelessly strives to cooperate with all countries that are willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union. The Soviet government agrees, with the participation of the U.S. government, to review all important outstanding issues and discuss ways to improve international relations – including relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America."

    关于朝鲜局势与苏美关系苏联政府致美国政府的声明
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：苏联报纸刊载了苏联政府关于朝鲜局势与苏美关系致美国政府的声明。十月五日，美国大使寇克先生访问苏联外交部长维辛斯基，奉美国政府之命就朝鲜局势和苏美关系提出口头声明。十月十五日，维辛斯基接见了代理不在莫斯科的美国大使的美国代理代办柯明先生，并向他提出下列声明。声明原文已递交柯明先生。 “十月五日，应美国驻苏大使寇克先生的请求，我接见了寇克先生。他说：他愿讨论改进我们两国关系的问题。大使说，他奉美国政府之命请求将他奉令就这一问题提出的声明通知苏联政府，并请斯大林大元帅亲自予以注意。其后，大使即宣读共达七、八页的长篇声明。
    当我表示希望得到这一声明的原文时，出乎我的意料之外，大使竟说，按照他奉到的训令，他仅能以口头方式提出这一声明，不能留下书面原文。
    一、寇克先生的声明内容大体归结如下：
    甲、寇克先生所宣读的声明指出，朝鲜问题是目前最尖锐、最危险的、需要立刻解决的国际问题。美国政府对于朝鲜停战谈判非常重视，认为停战谈判取得良好的结果，就会使得其他促成国际关系紧张的未决问题有可能解决，并会为改善苏美关系展露前途。大使说，美国政府希望苏联政府帮助使谈判完满结束。寇克先生虽一面向苏联政府呼吁帮助，然而同时却作了颇为奇怪的暗示，暗示假如这些谈判的结局不利，可能会在苏联和美国间造成
    ‘恶劣的影响’。
    大使并说，美国司令部反对在开城讨论关于确定停战线的问题，它认为这是政治性的问题。
    乙、声明还注意到苏美关系，硬说民主国家，即大使所谓‘共产主义集团’，没有表示出愿解决国际悬案的意愿，企图把造成国际关系紧张的责任推卸给民主国家。声明并硬说苏联在许多国际问题上坚持无可调和的态度，并且说什么这种态度使美国和其他国家惶惶不安。
    寇克先生并保证说，美国政府在军事方面现正采取的措施对于苏联及其他国家并无任何侵略意图，其目的仅为自卫，他是奉他本国政府之令而正式这样声明的。
    二、寇克先生在他的口头声明中主要是谈两个问题——朝鲜局势和苏美关系。
    苏联政府很重视这些问题，因此，有必要声明如下：
    甲、关于朝鲜局势。从寇克先生的声明中可以看出，美国政府担忧在朝鲜发生的局势，及停战谈判的进程。这种忧虑是完全可以理解的，因为大家知道，美国政府在向朝鲜人民发动战争之后，它的处境已使它担忧它在朝鲜所进行的军事赌博结局。
    但是，大使关于美国政府力求顺利完成开城谈判的声明，是与美国政府在这个问题上所遵循的政策不相符合的，美国政府有计划地拒绝了向它提出的关于真正和平解决朝鲜问题的一切建议，即是：立即停止朝鲜侵略战争，自朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，及以和平方法解决整个朝鲜问题这些建议。
    关于这一点，有必要促使美国政府注意苏联力求顺利完成开城谈判及结束朝鲜战争的努力。
    倡议和平解决朝鲜战争的不是美国政府，也不是联合国，而正是苏联政府。早在一九五零年七月初，苏联部长会议主席斯大林就主张经由安全理事会迅速解决朝鲜战事。
    在一九五零年第五届联合国大会上，苏联政府并提出了立即和平解决朝鲜问题和同时自朝鲜撤退外国军队的建议。最后，在一九五一年六月，苏联驻联合国代表马立克提出一项建议，建议交战方面举行关于停止敌对行动与停战的谈判，而双方把军队撤离三八线，作为走向和平解决朝鲜问题的第一个步骤。
    至于大使所谓开城谈判的延宕是北朝鲜军队和中国志愿军司令部的态度所造成的那种说法，是完全没有根据的。大家知道，朝鲜美英军队司令部有步骤地造成各种障碍来妨碍谈判的顺利进展，不惜制造李奇微将军用来使谈判复杂化的各种事件。开城谈判延宕的真正原因，正是美国司令部所制造的这些阻碍。
    可以保证停战谈判得到良好结局的最好方法，就是训令李奇微将军不要以种种事件使谈判复杂化，不要用无意义的争执，例如把谈判从开城移至另地举行的争执，来制造人为的阻碍。
    至于大使就敌对行动停止后双方军队驻扎的界线所说的话，苏联政府认为，这个问题是与停止敌对行动的问题有机地联系在一起的，因而在停战谈判中也就不能规避这个问题。
    苏联政府认为对于大使声明中关于南朝鲜境内侵略行动的武断之词无论述之必要，因为这种武断之词的诽谤性质是以前已无可辩驳地被证明了的。
    根据大使的声明，美国政府希望苏联政府帮助使开城谈判完满结束。可是，大家都知道，苏联政府并不是参加谈判的一方。正相反，美国政府却是谈判的一方，因而，恰恰是它可以采取步骤使谈判顺利完成。不用说，任何真正朝这个方向的努力，在目前，正如在过去一样，会得到苏联充分而有力的支持。
    乙、关于苏美关系。大使说，美国政府授权给他，要他提起苏联政府及斯大林大元帅本人注意改进我们两国关系的必要，大使同时指出，在这方面，像在解决其他国际悬案方面一样，朝鲜停战谈判的良好结束有巨大作用。
    当然，为了改善国际形势，努力求得朝鲜问题的和平解决是迫切必要的。苏联政府也曾屡次尝试在苏美关系的其他重要问题上以及其他尚未解决的最重要的国际问题上和美国取得谅解，例如采取措施以便利建立统一的、爱好和平的、民主的、独立的德国和缔结对德和约问题，对日媾和问题，无条件禁止原子武器并建立严格的国际管制的问题，停止扩张军备运动及裁军问题、禁止战争宣传问题、缔结和平公约问题。
    在苏联政府倡议下，一九五一年在巴黎召开了讨论德国问题及其他重要国际问题的外长助理会议。苏联建议在当时正考虑召开的外长会议的议程中列入若干迫切需要解决的问题，其中包括如大西洋公约及美国在欧洲和近东的军事基地之类的重要问题。但是，这个建议被美国政府以及英、法政府拒绝了。
    如果美国政府真正主张改善苏美关系及消除在上述若干重要国际问题上的分歧，如果它真正主张和平，它是有不少机会可以以行动证明它具有美国政府的声明所说的和平意愿的。但是，大家知道，美国政府并没有这样作。
    丙、寇克先生说，美利坚合众国对苏联和其他国家决没有侵略意图，并且力图改善我们两国间的关系。
    美国政府发表这种声明，并不是第一次了。在这方面，应当追述一下美国总统杜鲁门先生致苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克的信以及美国参众两院送达苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克的联合决议案。这些文件中也包含有这种性质的声明。可是，这并没有阻止美国政府同时废除自一九三七年到最近为止一直有效的美苏贸易协定，没有阻止美国政府在所谓战略理由的藉口下通过一项法律，禁止给予那些向苏联及与苏联友好的国家输出货物的国家以任何财政的或经济的所谓‘援助’，也没有阻止美国政府采取目的在断绝苏美间经济关系的其他措施。
    寇克先生宣读的声明又说：美国政府目前在军事方面采取的措施，其目的仅在于防御，对苏联和其他国家，没有任何侵略意图。可是，这种声明是与美国的行动矛盾的；美国的行动说明：美国政府所关心的决不是维持和平。这不仅表现在对朝鲜人民进行的战争上，而且表现在建立针对苏联和其他民主国家的侵略性的大西洋集团上，表现在使德国和日本重新军国主义化上，表现在扩张军备运动上，表现在在苏联周围建立许多美国军事基地上等等。
    丁、苏联政府不能忽视大使所说的话：如果开城谈判不能产生积极的结果，就会产生‘不良后果’，在我们两国之间也会有‘恶劣的影响’。首先就可以问：美国政府所说的‘不良后果’或‘恶劣的影响’是指什么？如果是指苏美关系可能进一步恶化的问题，那么，在杜鲁门总统告诉全世界说和苏联的协议还不值一张废纸以后，几乎不可能设想，两国的关系还能更加恶化。在这种情况下，对于愿改善苏美关系的声明，能够认真看待吗？美国政府事实上不是努力改善苏美关系并与苏联合作，而只是欢喜侈谈合作和协议，这样说法岂不是更正确吗？
    然而，苏联政府本着它的和平政策，不疲倦地力求与一切愿与苏联合作的国家进行合作。苏联政府同意在美国政府的参加下，审查一切尚未解决的重要问题，并讨论改善国际关系——包括苏联和美利坚合众国之间的关系——的办法。”
