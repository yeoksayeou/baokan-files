I Saw the Power of the Chinese People
By Dekin Kodomai, Burma

Editor's Note: Mr. Dekin Kodomai, head of the Burmese People's Observation Delegation invited to our National Day celebrations, writer, and historian, delivered a speech at the Central People's Broadcasting Station before leaving Beijing for Northeast China on the 10th of this month. The station broadcast a recording of his speech on the 20th. The following is a translated transcript of his speech.

Today, at this moment, our Burmese People's Observation Delegation is in Beijing, the capital of New China. We are here at the invitation of various people's organizations in China to participate in the Second National Day of the People's Republic of China.

Because it is an invitation from various people's organizations in China, representatives from various people's organizations in Burma have also come to participate in this conference. I am very happy and grateful to have traveled from Yangon by plane and boat to Beijing, the capital of China. Throughout this long journey, we have received a warm welcome and very thoughtful hospitality from various people's organizations in China.

The meticulous welcome and hospitality from the people's organizations in cities along the way, such as Guangzhou, have made us so happy, not for any other reason, but because we were invited by the people and are also welcomed and treated by the people.

I will not forget that I came here as a representative of the people. Beijing is an ancient capital; during the Bagan dynasty in Burma, a monk named Dittha Thada was sent to Beijing, the capital of China, to facilitate communication between the Chinese Emperor and the Burmese Emperor; this is historically documented, and we can still see such records on stone tablets. We are very honored to come to Beijing now, because we are not here for the interactions between emperors, as in the past, but for the connection between peoples.

It is memorable for us to participate in the National Day celebrations held in China on October 1st. Because China is a People's Republic, all the people enthusiastically participated in the parade; during such enthusiastic parades, their main slogans were: "Wish our leader Mao Zedong good health" and "Long live world peace." I have attended many meetings and met various people from all over the world, all of whom abhor war and love world peace. This is a peaceful attitude commonly adhered to from China's leaders to workers, peasants, and children.

Wherever we go, we can see the Chinese people engaged in construction. The people are rebuilding everything that was ruthlessly destroyed by the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek government, which makes me very excited. I see many large temples being renovated in the ongoing construction projects, and I deeply admire the people's government's care for ancient cultural relics. The People's Government is the true builder, while the Chiang Kai-shek government is a destructive government.

If Mao Zedong had not become the leader and Chiang Kai-shek had continued to rule, the Chinese people would have already become the slaves of the United States. Mao Zedong's leadership liberated China from violence.

I saw the power of the Chinese people. The current People's Government is a government based on the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, I believe that construction carried out by the power of workers and peasants will soon develop. The patriotism of the Chinese people that we are actually witnessing now greatly moves us. Finally, I congratulate the developing New China on moving further forward!

    我看见了中国人民的力量
    缅甸  德钦哥都迈
    编者按：应邀参加我国国庆节的缅甸人民观礼代表团团长、作家、历史学家德钦哥都迈，于本月十日离北京赴东北参观之前，应邀在中央人民广播电台演说，该台在二十日播送了他演说的录音，下面就是他演说的译稿。
    今天，在这个时候，我们缅甸人民观礼代表团正在新中国的首都——北京。我们是应中国各人民团体的邀请来参加中华人民共和国第二届国庆节的。
    由于是中国各人民团体的邀请，我们缅甸各人民团体的代表也就来参加这个大会。我很高兴而且非常感激，从仰光坐飞机、坐船到了中国的首都——北京，在这样遥远的路途上，受到了中国各人民团体的热烈欢迎和非常周到的招待。
    在沿途的广州等城市，各人民团体的无微不至的欢迎和招待，使我们这样高兴，并不是因为什么别的原因，而是因为我们是被人民邀请，同时也受到人民的欢迎和招待的原故。
    我不会忘记以人民代表的身份来到此地。北京是一个古老的国都；在缅甸布乾皇朝的时候，曾经派一个叫做地大教授的和尚到中国的首都北京来，进行中国皇帝和缅甸皇帝之间的来往；这是有历史根据的，我们还可以在石碑上看到这种记载。现在我们到北京来而感到非常荣幸，因为我们不是像过去那样，为了皇帝和皇帝之间的来往，而是为了人民和人民之间的联系。
    我们参加十月一日中国举行的中国国庆典礼，是值得记忆的。由于中国是人民共和国，因此全体人民都热情地参加了游行；在这样的热情游行的时候，他们的主要口号是：祝他们的领袖毛泽东健康和世界和平万岁。我参加了许多会议，见到了世界各国的各种人物，他们都厌恶战争，爱好世界和平。这是从中国的领导人物一直到工人、农民、儿童都共同信守的和平的态度。
    我们无论到什么地方去，都可以看到中国人民在进行建设。人民正在重新建设着被国民党蒋介石政府无情地破坏的一切，这使我非常兴奋。我看到正在修建的工程当中有许多的大庙宇，对于人民政府这种对古代文物的爱护我是非常敬佩的。人民政府是真正的建设者，而蒋介石政府是从事破坏的政府。
    假如不是毛泽东成为领导者，而是蒋介石继续统治着的话，中国人民现在就已经变成美国所奴役的牛马了。毛泽东的领导把中国从暴力中解放了出来。
    我看见了中国人民的力量。现在的人民政府是以工农联盟为基础的政府。所以我相信：以工农劳动者的力量来进行的建设，不久就会发展起来。现在实际上看到的中国人民的爱国热情，使我们大大地感动。最后我祝贺在发展中的新中国更加向前发展！
