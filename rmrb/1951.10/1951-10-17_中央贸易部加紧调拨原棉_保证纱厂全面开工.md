The Central Trade Department has intensified the allocation of raw cotton to ensure the full operation of cotton mills nationwide. At present, cotton mills in various regions have sufficient raw cotton reserves. Since the 3rd of this month, except for Shanghai and Southern Jiangsu (operating five days and five nights per week, totaling ten shifts), cotton mills throughout the country have been operating six days and six nights per week. Among them, cotton mills in Tianjin and Qingdao operate three shifts a day, working twenty-three hours. Cotton mills in Shanghai and Southern Jiangsu have also decided to operate six days and six nights per week, with two shifts per day, working twenty hours, starting from the 15th of this month. All spindles and looms that were not fully operational in the past can now be fully utilized. Recently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council telegraphed to various regions, urging them to strive for six days and seven nights of operation per week in late October to boost production. In the future, the supply of cotton yarn and cloth nationwide will become more reasonable and abundant. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央贸易部加紧调拨原棉
    保证纱厂全面开工
    为了保证全国纱厂全面开工，中央人民政府贸易部曾加紧原棉调拨。现各地纱厂都储备了足够的原棉，自本月三日起，除上海、苏南（每周开工五天五夜计十班）外，全国各地纱厂都已每周开工六天六夜。其中天津、青岛二地纱厂每日三班，开工二十三小时。上海、苏南二地纱厂也已决定自本月十五日起每周开工六天六夜，每日两班，开工二十小时；过去未开齐的纱锭、布机，这次都可全部开动。日前政务院财政经济委员会曾电示各地：在十月下旬要争取每周开工六天七夜，突击生产。今后全国纱布的供应，将日趋合理、富裕。（新华社）
