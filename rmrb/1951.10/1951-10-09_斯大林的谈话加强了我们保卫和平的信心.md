    Stalin's conversation on the issue of atomic weapons has greatly encouraged us, the teachers and students of Peking University. Everyone believes that the Soviet Union's mastery of atomic weapons is a major blow to the American and British imperialist warmongers and a guarantee of world peace.
    Professor Wen Jiasi of the Department of Western Languages said, "The Soviet Union now also has the atomic bomb, but the purpose of its use is completely different from that of the United States. The American ruling clique attempts to use it to launch wars of aggression, while the Soviet Union's mastery of atomic weapons is to defend world peace. We are excited and encouraged by this news, and only the American aggressor group will feel panic and fear." Professor Lou Bangyan of the Department of Political Science said, "Stalin's conversation makes us more clearly aware that we can only effectively stop wars of aggression by possessing a strong armed force." Professor Feng Zhi, Director of the Department of Western Languages, said, "We firmly support Stalin's conversation and demand the establishment of national defense control of atomic weapons." Liu Pu, Chairman of the Student Union, said, "We, the students of Peking University, believe that Comrade Stalin's conversation is the gospel of world peace. We must strive to improve our political level and cultivate ourselves into cadres who are 'both virtuous and talented, and physically sound' to fight for the defense of world peace!"

    斯大林的谈话加强了我们保卫和平的信心编辑同志：
    斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话，给予我们北京大学的师生极大的鼓舞。大家都认为苏联掌握了原子武器，就是对美英帝国主义战争贩子的一个重大打击；就是世界和平的保证。
    西语系的闻家驷教授说：“苏联现在也有了原子弹，但是使用的目的与美国绝不相同。美国统治集团企图利用它来发动侵略战争，而苏联掌握原子武器则是为了保卫世界和平。我们对于这个消息是兴奋和鼓舞，只有美国侵略集团才会感到恐慌与惧怕。”政治系楼邦彦教授说：“斯大林的谈话使我们更清楚地认识到：我们只有掌握着强大的武装力量，才能有效地制止侵略战争。”西语系主任冯至教授说：“我们坚决拥护斯大林的谈话，要求建立原子武器的国防管制。”学生会主席刘朴说：“我们北京大学的同学们认为斯大林同志的谈话是世界和平的福音。我们必须努力提高自己的政治水平，把自己培养成为‘德才兼备，体魄健全’的干部，为保卫世界和平而奋斗！”
