Letter from private cotton textile industrialists Rong Yiren and others to Comrade Qu Yaoli, a model agricultural laborer in Shanxi Province, forwarded by the North China Regional Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition:

    We are workers engaged in the cotton textile industry. This time, we visited the North China Regional Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin and were very excited to see the rich and great products of our motherland and the wisdom and creation of the working people. From now on, we have more confidence in relying on the working class and the peasant class to jointly complete the national production and construction. In the cotton pavilion of the exhibition, we saw that this year's cotton harvest greatly exceeded the highest output in history, and the quality has been improved compared with the past. In particular, your production team has surpassed last year's production results this year and created the highest cotton field yield record per mu in the country. Agricultural labor models in other places have also played an active role in production, ensuring the supply of raw materials for the cotton textile industry products most needed by the people of the country, and truly achieved urban-rural mutual assistance. These gains show that only in our New Democratic country can we have these unprecedented achievements, enabling our national industry and commerce to get rid of their past dependence on imperialism and embark on the road of self-reliance. In addition to thanking Chairman Mao, we also want to thank you and the farmers for your great contributions to production, and learn from your enthusiasm for production and your spirit of continuous efforts, to further improve our production, so that cotton textile factories can produce inexpensive and high-quality daily necessities to fully supply the needs of the vast people, and strive to gradually improve the lives of all our people! Let us work together to increase national wealth, enrich national defense, strengthen economic construction, strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and defend world peace.

Respectfully,

Rong Yiren (General Manager of Shanghai Shenxin Textile Mill)
Guo Dihuo (Deputy General Manager of Shanghai Wing On Textile Company)
Liu Jingji (General Manager of Shanghai Anda Textile Company)
Qian Sunqing (Chairman of Wuxi Qingfeng Textile Company)
Miao Hainan (General Manager of Jinan Chengtong Textile Company)
Li Guowei (Manager of Hankou, Baoji, Chongqing, and Shenxin No. 4 Textile Mill Management Office)
