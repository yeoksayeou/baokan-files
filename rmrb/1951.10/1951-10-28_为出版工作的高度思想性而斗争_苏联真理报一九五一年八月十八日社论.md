Editor's Note: This editorial from the Soviet Pravda points out that "the publishing industry is one of the most important departments on the ideological front," and that books are the wealth of the working people, and a powerful weapon for propagating Marxism-Leninism to the masses. The erroneous tendencies in Soviet publications that it points out also exist in our country, and are even more serious in degree. The editorial concludes by stating: "In the entire editing and publishing process, the editors bear the primary responsibility. The quality of the books depends mainly on their political cultivation and professional proficiency, and on their ability to handle manuscripts." It also proposes that "local Party organizations should constantly lead the activities of the various publishing bureaus and guide their work." This is even more urgently needed for us.

The culture of all nationalities in our country, with socialist content and national forms, has flourished brilliantly in the years of the Soviet regime. The Communist Party has shown unremitting concern for creating a rich spiritual culture and raising the cultural level of the working people. The publication of newspapers, magazines, and books in our country has reached a vast scale, which is one of the signs of our Party's concern for the communist cultivation and education of the people.

The task of the Soviet book publishing industry is fully in line with the interests of the Soviet people. Books in our country have become the wealth of the working people, and a weapon for the communist education of the masses. Soviet books are the most advanced books in the world, and their strength lies in the fact that they are books that have no and can have no other interests than the interests of the people and the interests of the state.

The publishing industry is one of the most important departments on the ideological front. The number of copies of Marxist-Leninist classics distributed is increasing year by year; the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are being published in the languages of all Soviet nationalities. The number of mass political, artistic, and scientific books printed is also growing.

The Party entrusts huge and arduous tasks to Soviet publishing workers. The work of Soviet publishing workers is truly glorious and noble. The main task in the entire publishing industry is to constantly concern oneself with the high ideological level of books. The ideological firmness and purpose of every book published are primarily determined by the publishing bureau. Publishing workers should always follow the foundation of the Soviet system, namely, the policies of the Bolshevik Party. All phenomena that lack ideological content and ignore politics and are harmful to the interests of the Soviet people and the Soviet state should not occur in our books. Publishing books that are ideologically poor will directly harm the education of the working people.

Regrettably, not all publishing bureaus are concerned with the high ideological level of the books they publish. Some leaders of publishing bureaus have embarked on the wrong path of simply pursuing the number of books issued, often at the expense of the quality of the books. Too much that is far removed from the needs of the people, full of errors, and narrow in content is being published. At the same time, the publication of books on current issues is pitifully small. Very few books are published on the great cause of communist construction.

For example, there are serious shortcomings in the work of the State Publishing Planning Bureau. It cannot guarantee the publication of books on the basic design issues of the national economy. Among the books it publishes, there are many that are ideologically flawed. Its publication of the collection of essays "Statistical Measurement of the Interrelationships of Various Phenomena" is a serious mistake, because the book has idealistic and erroneous viewpoints. The book "Organization and Design of Socialist Industrial Enterprises" also has many errors. Most of the books published by the State Planning Books Publishing Bureau do not contain in-depth economic analysis.

Improving the ideological and theoretical level of publications should be the task of all publishing workers without exception. Our books, whether artistic, scientific, or technical, cannot ignore politics. Soviet readers welcome with great interest works that reflect the achievements of socialist industry and agriculture and publicize advanced experiences. At the same time, readers are dissatisfied with the actual publishing situation of some science and technology book publishing bureaus and their branches, because these publishing bureaus have published many books of low political and scientific quality. The Agricultural Books Publishing Bureau has done a very poor job in promoting knowledge of agricultural biology. The publishing bureau's preparation of reference books on agricultural technology research is irresponsible. Some pamphlets not only do not promote advanced Michurin agricultural biology, but also contain incorrect viewpoints.

Soviet books, permeated with lofty ideas, should be the best books in the world in terms of content and form. Many central and local book publishing bureaus are good at exquisitely designing books, and the printing has reached a high quality. However, there are still books that are shoddy and poorly bound. For example, the design of some books published by the Latvian State Publishing Bureau has committed formalistic faults.

The creation of highly ideological and comprehensive books requires the efforts of all creative workers, including writers, editors, artists, and all staff members of editing and publishing institutions. Publishing bureaus that often cooperate with writers and dare to guide them to create new themes have achieved success. The working method of involving broad social circles—writers, scholars, and experts from various knowledge departments—in discussing writers' manuscripts has proven to be very valuable. Why don't other publishing bureaus adopt this very effective working method? We cannot tolerate the lifeless state of editorial meetings in many publishing bureaus. Editorial meetings should play a huge role in improving the ideological, artistic, and scientific level of publications.

In the entire editing and publishing process, the editors bear the primary responsibility. The quality of the books depends mainly on their political cultivation and professional proficiency; it depends on their ability to handle manuscripts. However, the leaders of the General Administration of Publishing and the various publishing bureaus are still not concerned enough about the political cultivation of the editorial staff, although their direct task is to improve the role and responsibility of the editors by all means and to care about their theoretical and professional improvement. In many publishing bureaus, the editors are people with poor cultivation, who have neither the proficiency they should have nor the necessary knowledge. Some of the editors of the Art Publishing Bureau have not completed higher education, and some of them are incompetent in their positions, and thus have made many ridiculous mistakes.

Publishing workers in the various publishing bureaus of the Soviet Union are carrying out huge and important political tasks. They have the right to obtain constant help and concrete leadership from Party organizations. Local Party organizations should constantly lead the activities of the various publishing bureaus and guide their work, but there is still the fact that they only lead local publishing bureaus in form. According to reports, the Gorky Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is limited to approving the plans of the provincial publishing bureau, but later it turned out that these plans were not implemented. This approach is not right. Party organizations should deeply and practically care about the overall situation of the publishing industry.

The Soviet people and the Bolshevik Party demand that all activities of publishing workers be permeated with a high degree of ideological content and conform to the tasks of our ideological work. The Soviet book publishing bureaus should publish more excellent books that best meet the needs and help our people to carry out the great cause of communist construction. (Translated by Wang Xun)

    为出版工作的高度思想性而斗争
    ——苏联真理报一九五一年八月十八日社论
    编者按：苏联真理报的这篇社论，指出“出版事业是思想战线上的一个最重要的部门”，书籍是劳动人民的财富，是向群众宣传马克思列宁主义的有力武器。它所指出的苏联出版物中的错误倾向，在我国不但同样存在着，而且在程度上更为严重。社论最后指出：“在整个编辑和出版过程中，负首要责任的是编辑，书籍的质量主要决定于他们的政治修养和业务的熟练程度，决定于他们处理原稿的能力。”并提出“地方党组织应该时刻领导各个出版局的活动，指导它们的工作。”这对我们说来更是迫切需要的。
    具有社会主义内容和民族形式的我国各个民族人民的文化，在苏维埃政权的年代中，光辉地繁荣起来了。共产党对于创造丰富的精神文化，提高劳动人民的文化水平，表现了不懈的关心。我国报纸、杂志、书籍的出版，已经达到了广大的规模，这就是我们党关心人民共产主义教养和教育的标志之一。
    苏联书籍出版事业的任务，是完全符合于苏联人民的利益的。书籍在我国已经成为劳动人民的财富，它是群众的共产主义教育的武器。苏联书籍是世界上最先进的书籍，它的力量在于：它是一种除了人民利益、国家利益以外没有也不可能有其他利益的书籍。
    出版事业是思想战线上的一个最重要的部门。马克思列宁主义经典著作发行数量逐年增加；马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作正在用苏联一切民族的语文出版。群众性的政治、艺术、科学书籍的印行数字都在增长中。
    党把巨大的、责任繁重的工作托付给苏联的出版工作者。苏联出版工作者的工作是真正光荣的、高尚的。整个出版事业中的主要工作，就是要经常不断地关心书籍的高度思想水平。每一本出版的书，它的思想上的坚定性和目的性首先决定于出版局。出版工作者应该经常遵循的是组成苏维埃制度的生活的基础，即布尔什维克党的政策。对于苏联人民和苏维埃国家利益有害的一切缺乏思想性、不问政治的现象，都不应该在我们的书籍中发生。出版思想性贫乏的书籍会使劳动人民的教育事业受到直接的损害。
    可惋惜的并不是所有的出版局都在关心它所出版的书籍的高度思想水平。某些出版局的领导人走上了单纯追求书籍的发行数量的歧途，常常损害到书籍的质量。和人民的需要距离很远的、错误百出的、内容偏狭的东西出得太多了。同时，有关现实问题的书籍的出版却少得可怜。有关共产主义伟大建设的书籍更很少出版。
    例如，国家出版计划局的工作中就存在着严重的缺点。它不能保证国民经济基本设计问题方面书籍的出版。在它所出版的书籍中，就有不少是在思想上有缺点的书籍。它出版“各种现象间联系的统计测量问题”文集，就是它的严重错误，因为该书有着唯心论的错误观点。“社会主义工业企业的组织和设计”一书的错误也很多。国家计划书籍出版局出版的书籍大多数都没有包含深刻的经济分析。
    提高出版物的思想理论水平，应该毫无例外地是所有出版工作者的任务。我们的书籍，无论是艺术的、科学的、技术的都不能不过问政治。苏联读者怀着莫大的兴趣欢迎反映社会主义工业和农业的成就和宣传先进经验的著作。同时，读者们对于某些科学技术书籍出版局和它们的分支出版局的实际出版情况表示不满。因为这些出版局出版了许多在政治和科学方面质量低劣的书籍。农业书籍出版局关于宣传农业生物学的知识的工作做得非常不好。该出版局对于农业技术研究的参考书的准备工作是不负责任的。某些小册子不仅没有宣传先进的米丘林农业生物学，而且还包含了不正确的观点。
    为崇高的思想所渗透的苏联书籍，在内容和形式上，都应该成为世界上最优良的书籍。许多中央的和地方的书籍出版局，大都善于精巧地装帧书籍，印刷也达到了高度的质量。但是粗制滥造、装帧恶劣的书籍也还是有的。例如，拉脱维亚国家出版局出版的某些书籍的装帧就犯了形式主义的毛病。
    有高度思想的和各方面都很完满的书籍的创造，需要全体富有创造性的工作者，其中包括著作家、编辑、美术工作者和编辑出版机构全体工作人员的努力。凡是经常和著作家合作的，敢于引导他们创造新的主题的出版局都达到了成功。由广大的社会人士——作家、学者和各种知识部门的专家参加讨论著作家的原稿，这种工作方式证明是很有价值的。为什么其他的出版局不采取这种非常有效的工作方法呢？我们对于许多出版局中的编辑会议死气沉沉的情形是不能容忍的。编辑会议在提高出版物的思想、艺术和科学水平上应当起巨大的作用。
    在整个编辑和出版过程中，负首要责任的是编辑。书籍的质量主要决定于他们的政治修养和业务的熟练程度；决定于他们处理原稿的能力。然而，出版总署和各出版局的领导者对于编辑人员的政治修养仍然不够关心，虽然它们的直接任务就在于用一切方法提高编辑的作用和责任，关心他们的理论和业务的提高。在许多出版局内，担任编辑的都是一些修养很差的人，他们既没有应当具备的熟练程度，也没有必需的知识。艺术出版局的一部分编辑，都没有受完高等教育，其中某些人不能胜任自己的职务，因而犯了许多可笑的错误。
    苏联各出版局的出版工作者执行着巨大的、重要的政治任务。他们有权取得党组织方面的经常帮助和具体领导。地方党组织应该时刻领导各个出版局的活动，指导它们的工作，但是，现在还存在着只是在形式上领导地方出版局的事实。报载联共（布）党高尔基省委会，只限于批准省出版局的计划，而后来事实证明，这些计划都没有执行。这种做法是不对的。党组织应该深刻而切实地关心出版事业的全面情况。
    苏联人民和布尔什维克党要求出版工作者的全部活动都要贯彻高度的思想性，并且要符合我们的思想工作的任务。苏联的书籍出版局应该更多地出版最能适合需要的优良的书籍，帮助我国人民去进行伟大的共产主义建设事业。    （王勋译）
