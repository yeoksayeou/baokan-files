Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The people of Egypt have launched a vigorous anti-imperialist struggle, unanimously opposing the attempts of US and British imperialists to enslave Egypt and turn it into their aggression base in the Near East. According to TASS news: Thousands of workers, students, and employees of various enterprises and institutions in Cairo held a demonstration on the 16th, supporting the decision to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and expressing that the people will never allow Egypt to participate in the measures of US and British imperialists aimed at establishing an aggressive Mediterranean bloc.
    Mass demonstrations were also held in other cities. In the Suez Canal Zone, train drivers refused to drive trains carrying British troops, and taxi drivers in Ismailia refused to pick up British soldiers.
    Workers constructing the British military airport in Abu Suweir have gone on strike. On October 15, workers and students in Alexandria held a demonstration. Despite the police ban, demonstrators marched on the main streets of the city, shouting anti-imperialist slogans.
    Recent news from Egypt reports that the "movement to boycott the British military occupation of the Suez Canal Zone" is surging.
    According to a Telecommunications Agency report: A delegation of Suez Canal workers declared in Cairo on the 17th that all 40,000 Egyptian workers in the Canal Zone refused to work for the British. Butchers in the Suez Canal Zone met on the 16th to discuss measures to cut off meat supplies to British troops in the Canal Zone. In Suez, people held a demonstration on the 11th. Demonstrators carried a coffin, symbolizing the death of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Demonstrators marched from Suez to the nearby Port Taufiq and tore down the British club's flag.

    Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Cairo News: The Egyptian Parliament passed on the 15th the decree proposed by Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan. This decree was approved by Egyptian King Farouk on the 16th.
    After the Egyptian government decided to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, on October 13, the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey jointly proposed to the Egyptian government that Egypt participate in the proposed "Middle East Joint Command" aggression bloc.
    The four-country proposal attempts to replace the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty with a new agreement to establish a so-called "Middle East Joint Command." The four-country proposal pointed out that if Egypt joined this "Joint Command" organization, Britain would agree to abolish the 1936 treaty and would be willing to withdraw British troops from Egypt who are not under the control of the "Joint Command." However, Egypt must "provide troops to be placed under the disposal of the Middle East Joint Command and provide the necessary strategic defense facilities for the Command, such as military bases, air force bases, communication equipment, fortifications, etc."
    This conspiracy of US and British imperialism immediately aroused the indignation of the people across Egypt. People in Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Suez, and other places held large-scale anti-imperialist demonstrations. They firmly opposed the continued occupation of Egypt and the transformation of Egypt into an aggression base. The Egyptian government announced on the 15th its refusal to accept the proposals of the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey.
    Commenting on the four-country proposal, the Cairo newspaper "Al-Misri" said: "The purpose of the four-country proposal is nothing more than to consolidate the position of imperialism in Egypt and Sudan. ... This proposal is a greater insult to Egypt than the shameful 1936 treaty that our country has torn up. Egypt has begun its anti-imperialist struggle, and nothing in the world will prevent it from following this path of struggle."

    埃及各地人民继续举行反帝游行示威
    反对美英帝国主义变埃及为近东侵略基地的阴谋
    埃及政府拒绝参加美英法土四国建议的“中东联合司令部”组织
    【新华社十八日讯】埃及各地人民展开如火如荼的反帝斗争，一致反对美、英帝国主义者奴役埃及并把埃及变为他们在近东的侵略基地的企图。据塔斯社消息：开罗的工人、学生以及各企业和各机关的职员数千人曾在十六日举行示威游行，拥护关于废除一九三六年缔结的英埃条约的决定，并表示人民决不允许埃及参加美、英帝国主义者旨在建立侵略性的地中海集团的措施。
    其他城市中也举行了群众性的示威。在苏彝士运河区，火车司机拒绝驾驶装运英军的火车，伊士美利亚的出租汽车的司机拒绝英国军人搭乘。
    在阿布苏威兹建筑英国军用飞机场的工人已经停工。十月十五日，亚历山大港的工人和学生曾举行示威，示威者不顾警察禁止，依然在城内主要的大街上游行，高呼反对帝国主义的口号。
    来自埃及的最近消息，都报道“抵制英军占领苏彝士运河区的运动”正在高涨。
    另据电通社讯：苏彝士运河工人代表团十七日在开罗宣称，运河区的四万埃及工人全体拒绝替英国人工作。苏彝士运河区的肉商十六日曾开会商讨断绝对运河区英军的肉类供应的措施。在苏彝士，人们曾在十一日举行示威游行。示威者抬着一口棺材，象征英埃条约的死亡。示威者从苏彝士走到附近的特菲克港，并撕下了英国俱乐部的旗帜。
     【新华社十八日讯】开罗讯：埃及议会已在十五日通过埃及首相纳哈斯所提关于废除英埃条约和英埃共管苏丹协定的法令。这一法令并已在十六日经埃及国王法鲁克批准。
    在埃及政府决定废除英埃条约之后，十月十三日，美、英、法、土耳其四国联合向埃及政府提出建议，要求埃及参加建议中的所谓“中东联合司令部”侵略集团。
    四国建议企图用成立所谓“中东联合司令部”的新协定来代替一九三六年的英埃条约。四国建议指出，如果埃及参加了这个“联合司令部”组织，英国将同意废除一九三六年条约，并愿将那些不属于
    “联合司令部”支配的英军撤出埃及。但埃及必须
    “提供交由中东联合司令部支配的军队，以及为司令部提供必要的战略防御设备，诸如军事基地、空军基地、通讯设备、堡垒等”。
    美、英帝国主义的这一阴谋，立即激起了埃及全国人民的愤慨。开罗、亚历山大、塞得港、苏彝士等地人民都举行了大规模的反帝示威。他们坚决反对继续占领埃及和把埃及变为侵略基地。埃及政府在十五日宣布拒绝美、英、法、土四国的建议。
    开罗“埃及人报”在评论四国建议时说：“四国建议的目的无非是要巩固帝国主义在埃及和苏丹的地位。……这个建议对于埃及说来，比我国已经撕毁的可耻的一九三六年条约是一个更大的侮辱。埃及已经开始了反帝斗争，世界上没有什么东西会使它不走向这条斗争的道路。”
