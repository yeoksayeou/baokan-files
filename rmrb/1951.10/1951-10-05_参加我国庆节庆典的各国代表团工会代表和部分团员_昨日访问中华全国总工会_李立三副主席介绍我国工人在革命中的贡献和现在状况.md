Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Trade union representatives and some members of the foreign delegations invited to participate in our National Day celebrations visited the All-China Federation of Trade Unions this morning and held a symposium. The foreign guests present were 23 representatives from 12 countries: the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, India, Burma, and Pakistan. Li Lisan, Zhu Xuefan, and Liu Ningyi, vice-chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Secretary-General Xu Zhizhen, and standing committee members and ministers of various departments in Beijing attended the reception.

    Vice Chairman Li Lisan introduced the situation of the Chinese workers' movement and trade union work. He first extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the Chinese working class and expressed sincere thanks to the working classes of all countries. Li Lisan said: The Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, achieved today's victory after 30 years of long struggle, overthrowing the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and achieving liberation. One of the main reasons for this was the sympathy and help from the working classes of all countries in the world, especially the Soviet working class.

    Li Lisan gave a detailed introduction to the changes in the political, economic, and cultural status of the new Chinese workers and the work of the trade unions. Li Lisan said: After the Central People's Government promulgated the Trade Union Law, the organization of Chinese workers has developed greatly, with 6,130,977 people joining the trade union. After the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Law, 2,165,226 people are now enjoying the benefits of labor insurance, and including their families, about 10 million people are enjoying labor insurance. Chinese workers have also been liberated culturally, with 1,718,246 workers participating in spare-time schools.

    Li Lisan continued: The Chinese workers were the advanced force of the Chinese people in the revolutionary struggle in the past, and they are now also the advanced force of the Chinese people in the construction of the country. Although China's factories and enterprises have been damaged by the Kuomintang and imperialism, thanks to the workers' initiative, China's industry and transportation have not only recovered but also developed in the recent two years compared with the last period under the Kuomintang rule. Chinese workers know that the People's Government is their own government, and they oppose any enemy who comes to destroy the people's motherland. Therefore, Chinese workers are playing a leading role in defending the motherland and peace. After the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, many young workers in factories have requested to join the volunteer army, railway workers have organized volunteer aid Korea teams, and workers across China have launched patriotic production competitions.

    Li Lisan emphasized in conclusion: In the year since the Chinese people launched the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the US imperialist troops have been continuously defeated. This proves that as long as the people unite, they can surely defeat US imperialism. The experience of the Chinese working class proves that the unity of the whole people must first have the unity of the working class. With the unity of the Asian working class, the unity of the Asian people can be guaranteed. With the unity of the working class of the world, the peace-loving people of the world against imperialism can unite. With the unity of the people of the world, no imperialism is to be feared, the imperialist war conspiracy can be stopped, and world peace will be guaranteed. The presence of workers' representatives from various countries at this Chinese National Day is itself a symbol of the further unity of the Asian working class and the world working class. Therefore, we extend our sincere respect to the working classes of all countries.

    Li Lisan's report was warmly welcomed. Then, V. K. Rao and Bhattacharyya, members of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China, and Dieter, head of the German Democratic Republic People's Observation Delegation and representative of the Free German Trade Union Federation, stood up and spoke, paying tribute to the revolutionary Chinese workers and their great achievements, and raised questions about the living conditions of workers and the education of trade union cadres, which were answered by Vice Chairman Li Lisan and Liu Zihui, Chairman of the Chinese Education Workers' Trade Union, respectively.

    Mian Iftikharuddin, head of the Pakistan People's Observation Delegation, said in his speech: The achievements of the People's Republic of China in the two years since its founding are great. I admire your achievements. China is still a country with an agricultural economy as its mainstay, and the lives of workers have been so greatly improved. This has pointed out the way for us.

    Solovyov, head of the Soviet People's Observation Delegation and Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, finally stood up and said in his speech: The Soviet workers welcome the great achievements of the Chinese workers under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader Chairman Mao Zedong with great pleasure and satisfaction, and wish the Chinese workers further achievements in the work of building a happy life for the Chinese people. The close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is developing, and the internationalist ties between the trade union organizations of China and the Soviet Union are developing. This friendship and tie is the best guarantee for the struggle for peace. The Soviet workers are willing to give the Chinese workers all assistance. After the end of his speech, Solovyov stepped forward and shook hands cordially with Li Lisan, Zhu Xuefan, and Liu Ningyi, and warm applause rang out in the hall.

    Iosif An. Jercu, a member of the Romanian People's Observation Delegation, handed over a letter of tribute entrusted to him by the Bucharest railway workers to the Chinese railway workers to Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union. The symposium then ended in a warm atmosphere.

    参加我国庆节庆典的各国代表团工会代表和部分团员
    昨日访问中华全国总工会
    李立三副主席介绍我国工人在革命中的贡献和现在状况
    【新华社四日讯】应邀参加我国国庆节庆祝典礼的各国代表团的工会代表和部分团员在今天上午访问了中华全国总工会，并举行座谈会。出席的外宾有：苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、蒙古、德意志民主共和国、印度、缅甸和巴基斯坦十二国的代表二十三人。中华全国总工会副主席李立三、朱学范、刘宁一，秘书长许之祯和在京的常务委员和各部部长都出席招待。
    李立三副主席介绍了中国工人运动和工会工作的情形。他首先代表中国工人阶级热烈欢迎贵宾，并向各国工人阶级表示诚挚的感谢。李立三说：中国工人阶级在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席领导下在三十年的长期斗争中得到了今天的胜利，把帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治推翻，得到解放，其中主要原因之一就是得到全世界各国工人阶级首先是苏联工人阶级的同情与帮助。
    李立三详尽地介绍了新中国工人在政治上、经济上和文化上翻身的情况及工会工作的状况。李立三说：在中央人民政府颁布了工会法以后，中国工人的组织已有了巨大的发展，六百十三万零九百七十七人参加了工会。在劳动保险法颁布以后。现在有二百十六万五千二百二十六人享受到劳动保险的福利，加上他们的家属，享受劳动保险的约有一千万人。中国工人在文化上也翻了身，参加业余学校的工人有一百七十一万八千二百四十六人。
    李立三接着说：中国工人过去在革命斗争中是中国人民的先进队伍，现在在国家的建设中也是中国人民的先进队伍。虽然中国的工厂、企业受到了国民党和帝国主义的破坏，但由于工人发挥了积极性，在最近的两年当中，中国的工业和交通事业与国民党统治下的最后时期相比，不只是已经恢复而且有了发展。中国工人知道人民政府是自己的政府，他们反对任何敌人来破坏人民的祖国。因此，中国工人在保卫祖国与和平中起着带头作用。在抗美援朝运动展开后，许多工厂的青年工人都要求参加志愿军，铁路工人组织了志愿援朝大队，全中国工人展开了爱国主义生产竞赛。
    李立三最后着重指出：中国人民展开抗美援朝运动的一年来，美帝国主义的军队已不断被打败。这证明只要人民团结起来，一定可以打垮美帝国主义。中国工人阶级的经验证明：全国人民的团结首先要有工人阶级的团结。有了亚洲工人阶级的团结，就能保障亚洲人民的团结。有了全世界工人阶级的团结，全世界反对帝国主义爱好和平的人民就可以团结起来。有了全世界人民的团结以后，任何帝国主义都不可怕，帝国主义的战争阴谋都可以制止，全世界和平就有了保障。这次中国国庆节有各国工人代表来参加，这件事本身就是亚洲工人阶级、世界工人阶级进一步团结起来的象征。因此，我们特别对各国工人阶级致诚恳的敬礼。
    李立三的报告受到热烈的欢迎。接着，印度亲善访华团团员维·克·劳和巴塔查利雅，德意志民主共和国人民观礼代表团团长、自由德国工会联合会代表狄特都起立发言，向革命的中国工人及其伟大成就致敬，并提出关于工人生活情况和工会干部教育的问题，由李立三副主席和中国教育工作者工会主席刘子久分别作了解答。
    巴基斯坦人民观礼代表团团长米安·伊夫提卡鲁丁致词说：中华人民共和国建国两年来的成就是伟大的，我钦佩你们的成就，中国现在还是以农业经济为主的国家，工人的生活已经得到了这样大的改善，这已给我们指出了道路。
    苏联人民观礼代表团团长、全苏工会中央理事会书记索洛维耶夫最后起立致词，他说：苏联工人以极其愉快和满足的心情，来欢迎中国工人在伟大的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席领导下获得的伟大成就，并祝中国工人在建设中国人民的幸福生活的工作中获得更进一步的成就。中苏两国人民之间的紧密的友谊在发展着，中苏两国的工会团体之间的国际主义的联系在发展着，这种友谊和联系就是争取和平的最好保证。苏联工人愿意给中国工人以一切援助。索洛维耶夫在致词结束后，趋前与李立三、朱学范和刘宁一亲切地握手，会场响起热烈的掌声。
    罗马尼亚人民观礼代表团团员约西夫·安·节尔科以布加勒斯特铁路工人委托他带给中国铁路工人的致敬信，交给中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯。座谈会随即在热烈的气氛中结束。
