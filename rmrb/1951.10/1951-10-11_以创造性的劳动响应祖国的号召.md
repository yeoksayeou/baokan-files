    Fully Exploit Industrial Potential to Create More Wealth for the Nation

    Responding to the Motherland's Call with Creative Labor
    By Our Special Correspondent Yang Luolin
    Improving Factory Management is the Prerequisite for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    The Shenyang No. 2 Machinery Factory, in response to the call for increased production and practicing economy by Comrade Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, plans to increase production and practice economy to the tune of 64,874 tons of grain for the country this year. As of the end of August, 32,403 tons have been completed, exactly half of the original planned increase in production and practicing economy. Improving factory management is the prerequisite for the movement to increase production and practice economy, and also the inevitable result of the movement. After more than a month of the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Shenyang No. 2 Machinery Factory has seen new developments in all aspects. Factory management has made significant progress; the technical operating procedures of each workshop have been revised and supplemented several times; the technical responsibility system has been fully established; various product inspection standards and testing systems have been stipulated and can be adhered to. In the past, the equipment utilization rate of the machine processing workshop was 54 percent, and now it has reached 87.06 percent. When the second workshop formulated its production plan in September, tasks were assigned according to each machine tool, and the workers themselves grasped the progress of their work, truly understanding the situation in their hearts, so they worked with particular enthusiasm. From September 3rd to 18th, the workshop reduced 461 working hours without producing any defective products. In formulating the plan to increase production and practice economy, everyone began to learn to make detailed calculations; since the launch of the competition to increase production and practice economy, each group has begun to register and statistics the extent to which each person has completed their task, essentially establishing the idea of economic accounting.
    Before receiving the specific tasks assigned by the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration Bureau, the factory had automatically formulated a preliminary plan to increase production and practice economy by 20,000 tons of grain. This preliminary plan was drawn up based on the statistical data from the financial department. At that time, it was neither discussed with the manufacturing department nor consulted with the broad masses of workers, so the planned figure was very low. At that time, the factory, like other factories and mines in the Northeast, was concentrating its efforts on quality inspection. The leading cadres were afraid of disrupting the original work pace, so they did not dare to announce this preliminary plan to the broad masses of workers. However, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the workers was very high. After seeing the news in the newspapers, they consciously took action.
    In early July, the factory received the task assigned by the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration Bureau and submitted it to the Factory Management Committee for discussion in conjunction with the preliminary plan that the factory had already drawn up. At that time, some people felt that the requirements were too high and the plan was too large. In order to increase the confidence of all employees, the factory's administrative leading cadres adopted the method of first conducting investigation and research, and then formulating specific plans. Therefore, the factory began to shift its attention from the financial department's books to the workshops, warehouses, and manufacturing departments.
    After investigation and research, an inexhaustible source was immediately discovered. In the past, what some people felt was the most difficult problem was shortening the cycle of circulating funds; at this time, it was discovered that the circulating funds accumulated in reserved materials and stagnant goods alone exceeded the quota by 32 percent. This seriously affected the turnover of circulating funds. The results of the investigation in the manufacturing department revealed that the scrap rate was high, the cost was high, and the capacity of the mechanical equipment had not been fully utilized... After finding these shortcomings, they studied whether they could be improved and how to improve them. Everyone immediately had confidence and unanimously believed that they could complete the task assigned by the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration Bureau and there was a possibility of exceeding it. At this time, the steelmaking department guaranteed to increase the finished product rate of steel ingots by 4 percent and reduce the scrap rate of cold steel wheels from 50 percent to 40 percent; the cast iron department planned to reduce the scrap rate from 28.4 percent to 12 percent; the open hearth operation department prepared to increase the mechanical utilization rate by 5.6 percent. In this way, the manufacturing department alone could increase production and save wealth equivalent to 31,000 tons of grain. Adding the plans of other departments, it was statistically possible to increase production and save wealth equivalent to 60,000 tons of grain for the country. At the end of August, the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration Bureau formally stipulated that the factory's task of increasing production and practicing economy was 64,874 tons.
    Consulting with the Masses Solved the Problem
    Increasing production and saving wealth equivalent to more than 60,000 tons of grain for the country was a big deal for the factory. The factory's leading cadres patiently consulted with the masses and handled this matter well. When some workers discussed the plan, they put forward many surprising goals, for example, steel workers again increasing the finished product rate of steel ingots by 1 percent and reducing the scrap rate of cast steel to 0.5 percent, which was very difficult.
    What does the progress from the 20,000-ton plan to the more than 60,000-ton plan illustrate? It illustrates that the call to increase production and save wealth equivalent to 10 million tons of grain for the country is a comprehensive political slogan. It can not only be unified with the quality inspection movement currently underway in the Northeast, but also should be unified. After unification, the purpose of the quality inspection will be clearer. The factory's leading cadres initially lacked sufficient understanding of this and had been afraid to publicize the new task, fearing that it would disrupt the original pace, but the actual result was that the call to increase production and practice economy greatly improved the quality.
    The Results of the Investigation and Research Gave Enterprise Leaders a Big Lesson
    The fact from 20,000 tons to more than 60,000 tons gave the enterprise leading cadres a big lesson. It exposed the shortcomings in enterprise management and urged enterprise leading cadres to conduct a comprehensive inspection. During the inspection process, the factory found that the reserved materials and stagnant goods exceeded the quota by 32 percent. This discovery enabled the factory to find a way to accelerate the turnover of circulating funds, and also tested the existing shortcomings in the factory's management system. The factory had also formulated quotas and established various responsibility systems in the past, but why were there still such big loopholes? On the one hand, this shows that the system that the factory had already formulated was not completely reasonable, and some were not seriously implemented; on the other hand, it also shows that due to the development of production, some systems already needed to be revised accordingly. After this inspection and improvement, not only was a method to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy found, but the factory's business management work was also greatly promoted and improved.
    This movement to increase production and practice economy once again educated the enterprise leading cadres that the strength of the working class is great. Therefore, in the face of any great political task, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of relying on the working class and consulting with the masses in everything. The plan drawn up by the factory after consulting with the masses was more than doubled compared with the preliminary plan, which is a powerful proof.

    以创造性的劳动响应祖国的号召
    本报特约记者  杨洛林
    改进工厂管理是增产节约的前提
    沈阳第二机械厂响应东北人民政府高岗主席增产节约的号召，计划在今年为国家增产节约六万四千八百七十四吨粮食的财富。至八月底止，已完成三万二千四百零三吨，恰恰等于原定增产节约计划的一半。改进工厂管理，是增产节约运动的前提，也是增产节约运动的必然结果。沈阳第二机械厂经过一个多月的增产节约运动，在各方面都出现了新的气象。工厂管理有了显著的进步；各工段的技术操作规程都经过数次修改补充；技术责任制已全部建立；各种产品检查标准与检验制度已经规定，并能坚持执行。过去机器加工车间设备运用率为百分之五十四，现已达百分之八十七点零六。二工段在九月份订生产计划时，按每台机床分配任务，工友自己掌握工作进度，真正作到心中有数，因此干得特别起劲。九月三日到十八日，该工段缩短四百六十一个工时，且未出废品。在订增产节约计划中，大家开始学会了算细账；展开增产节约竞赛以来，各小组开始登记统计每个人完成任务的程度，实质上树立了经济核算思想。
    该厂在没有接到东北机械工业管理局分配的具体任务时，便自动订出增产节约两万吨粮食的初步计划。这个初步计划是根据财务部门的统计资料拟订的。当时既没有和制造部门研究，更没有和广大工人群众商量，因此计划数字很低。该厂当时和东北其他厂矿一样，正在集中力量搞质量检查，领导干部害怕打乱原来的工作步调，因此不敢向广大工人群众宣布这个初步计划。但工人群众的政治热情和生产积极性很高，他们从报纸上看到消息后，便自觉地行动起来了。
    七月初，该厂接到东北机械工业管理局分配的任务，便结合该厂已经拟订的初步计划，提交工厂管理委员会讨论。当时有些人觉得要求太高，计划太大。为了提高全体职工的信心，该厂行政领导干部采取了先做调查研究，然后制订具体计划的方法。于是，该厂开始把注意力从财务部门的账面上，移到车间、仓库和制造部门。
    经过调查研究，立时发现了无穷尽的源泉。以前有些人最感困难的是缩短流动资金周期的问题；这时发现单只储备材料和呆滞品积压的流动资金，就超过了定额数的百分之三十二。严重地影响了流动资金的周转。在制造部门调查的结果，发现废品率大，成本高，机械设备能力还没有充分发挥……。找到了这些缺点后，又研究了能否改进和改进的办法。大家立时信心百倍，一致认为能够完成东北机械工业管理局分配的任务，并有超过的可能。这时候，炼钢部门保证提高钢锭成品率百分之四，把冷钢轮的废品率由百分之五十降低到百分之四十；铸铁部门计划将百分之二十八点四的废品率，降至百分之十二；平炉操作部门准备提高机械运用率百分之五点六。这样，单是制造部门，便可增产和节约三万一千吨粮食的财富。加上其他部门的计划，统计可给国家增产和节约六万吨粮食的财富。八月底，东北机械工业管理局正式规定该厂的增产节约任务为六万四千八百七十四吨。
    和群众商量，解决了问题
    为国家增产和节约六万多吨粮食的财富，对该厂来说，是一件很大的事情。该厂领导干部和群众耐心商量，就把这件事情办好了。部分工人讨论计划时，提出许多惊人的目标，例如，制钢工人再度提高钢锭成品率百分之一，降低铸钢废品率到百分之零点五，这是很不容易的。
    从两万吨的计划进步到六万多吨的计划，这个事实说明了什么呢？它说明了为国家增产和节约一千万吨粮食的财富的号召，是一个全面性的政治口号。它不但和目前东北正在进行的质量检查运动能够统一起来，而且也应当统一起来。统一起来以后，就使质量大检查的目的性更加明确了。该厂领导干部开始对此认识不足，一直不敢宣传新的任务，恐怕打乱了原来的步调，但实际结果，增产和节约的号召，却把质量大大提高了一步。
    调查研究的结果，给企业领导者上了一大课
    从两万吨到六万多吨的事实，给企业领导干部上了一大课。它揭露了企业管理上的缺点，督促企业领导干部必须进行全面检查。检查过程中，该厂发现了储备材料和呆滞品超过定额的百分之三十二。这个发现，使该厂找到了加速流动资金周转的道路，也考验了该厂经营管理制度上现存的缺点。该厂过去也制订过定额，也建立过各种责任制，但是，为什么还有这么大的漏洞呢？这一方面说明该厂已经订了的制度，并不完全合理，有的也没有认真贯彻执行；另方面也说明由于生产的发展，某些制度已经需要随之改订。经过这次检查和改进，不仅找到了完成增产节约任务的方法，而且把该厂经营管理工作也大大推进和提高了一步。
    这次增产节约运动，又一次教育了企业领导干部，工人阶级的力量是伟大的，因此，在任何伟大的政治任务面前，必须坚决贯彻依靠工人阶级，凡事和群众商量的原则。该厂和群众商量以后拟订的计划，较初步计划提高了两倍多，便是一个有力的证明。
