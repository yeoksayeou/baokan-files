	Increase Unit Area Yield, Produce More Grain
	—Introduction to the Grain Pavilion of the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition
		Lin Wei
	The materials from the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition tell us that since liberation, the planting area of industrial raw material crops in North China has expanded, and the harvest of grain has also increased. What is the reason for this? This is because more grain has been produced per unit area, that is, the unit area yield has increased. The charts in the "Grain Pavilion" illustrate the following figures: compared with 1947, the main food crop of the North China people, millet, increased by 18 percent, wheat increased by 7.5 percent, and corn increased by more than 50 percent. From a national perspective, we are no longer a country that needs to import grain (like during the Kuomintang rule), and our grain problem can be said to have been solved. Based on the experience of labor models in various regions, the main key to increasing the yield per unit area is to select superior varieties, increase fertilizer application, and cultivate meticulously (including the use of scientific farming techniques).
	The "Grain Pavilion" introduces many superior crop varieties that have been successfully tested by farms and proven effective by farmers. In terms of millet, there are high-yielding varieties such as "Huanong No. 4," "811," "Bai Liusha," drought-resistant varieties such as "Xiao Qitou Huang," early-maturing varieties such as "Bianqu No. 1," and varieties with particularly good quality such as "Qinzhou Huang," "Dongfang Liang." In terms of wheat, there is the high-yielding and smut-resistant "Pingyuan 50" wheat, the early-maturing and high-yielding "Youzi" wheat, as well as Ding County "72" wheat, Shanxi "169" wheat, "Jin Guoyin" wheat, etc. In addition, the pavilion also introduces the excellent "Victory No. 100" and "Nonglin No. 4" sweet potatoes. Farmers visiting from various regions showed particularly strong interest in these superior varieties.
	The pavilion exhibits many examples of labor models increasing yield per unit area, concretely telling the audience many methods and experiences for increasing yield per unit area. Guo Yunxiang from Xushui County, Hebei Province, can produce more than 900 jin of millet per mu, exceeding the local general yield by two or three times. The reasons are: First, planting the "Huanong No. 4" superior millet variety; second, adopting scientific fertilization methods, that is, using a hoe to break open a five-inch wide and three-inch deep ditch, and evenly spreading 6,400 jin of earth manure and 100 jin of crushed sesame cake in the ditch; third, dense planting, that is, scattering three jin of seeds per mu along the fertilized ditch, and scattering half a jin of treated grain as poison bait to prevent mole crickets; fourth, proper thinning and transplanting, that is, when the seedlings are one or two inches tall, thin them once, thinning the dense ones and removing the weak ones, and when the seedlings are four or five inches tall, leave one seedling every two or three inches alternately, leaving seven or eight seedlings within one foot; fifth, appropriate inter-tillage and weeding, that is, after thinning, shallow hoe once; when the seedlings are more than one foot tall, hoe twice to remove the grass, and hoe once again before the foxtail millet appears; sixth, frequent watering: water frequently when flowering, using small amounts of water, and water heavily when heading. Due to these proper measures, his millet grows particularly strong, with thick stems, five feet six inches tall, and ears seven or eight inches to one foot long.
	Li Shunda from Pingshun County, Shanxi, harvested 980 jin of corn per mu, which is also two or three times higher than the average yield. The reasons for his high yield are: First, planting the "Golden Queen" superior variety; second, after harvesting millet in the autumn, shallowly cultivate to eliminate stubble, deeply plow and turn the soil before the ground freezes, plow up the subsoil, expose it to the sun during the winter to mature the subsoil, break up the soil clods when the spring thaws, and sow before the beginning of summer, sowing three or four seeds per hole; third, apply 100 dan of sheep manure per mu as base fertilizer, and then pour a small amount of thin human manure into each hole, cover with soil and compact it; fourth, thin and weed when the seedlings are four or five inches tall, with a plant spacing of two feet and a row spacing of two and a half feet, with more than 1,100 plants per mu, and apply 20 dan of manure per mu as top dressing when the seedlings are two and a half feet tall; fifth, hoe carefully the first time, hoe deeply the second time, and loosen the soil surface and bury the soil the third time; sixth, implement field selection of seeds at maturity.
	Last year, Pingyuan Province experienced drought followed by flooding, and wheat was planted late, so the emergence of seedlings was generally not very good. However, the wheat grown by Li Wentong in Wuzhi County, Henan Province, still harvested an average of 544 jin per mu. The reason is that he selected the superior variety "Banjie Mang" wheat from Xiuwu County; plowed twice, harrowed fifteen times; used 5,000 jin of corral manure and 150 jin of mung bean residue per mu as base fertilizer, and applied another 150 jin of mung bean residue per mu as top dressing in February this year; hoeed and watered on time.
	Ma Guorong from Changli County, Hebei Province, planted "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes last year, yielding the equivalent of 10,000 jin per mu. When the sweet potatoes matured, the sweet potato tubers in each hole were connected to each other, squeezing the raw soil to crack. His planting methods are: First, when raising seedlings, insist on adding less water and slowly adding fire to make the seedlings grow in a timely manner. Therefore, the seedlings produced by each kang were very strong; second, concentrate the application of fertilizer: on the seven and a half fen of sweet potato land, apply more than 3,000 jin of old house soil, and concentrate it in the furrow, so that the effect of the fertilizer can be fully utilized and the benefits of applying more fertilizer can be achieved; third, management methods: make ridges with a plow, plant seedlings in water in early April of the lunar calendar using two-branch seedlings, cultivate once, hoe once, and pull out weeds as they appear, without turning the vines.
	In addition, the Grain Pavilion also introduced excellent examples of farmers fighting against the natural environment. The climate in Chahar Province is very cold, and in the past, people thought that winter wheat could not be grown. However, Wang Youfu from Xuanhua County finally succeeded in trial planting winter wheat by adopting the methods of early sowing, increasing the amount of seeds, increasing the amount of fertilizer, deep plowing, and irrigating winter water, and the harvest was twice as much as that of spring wheat. Some farmers in the flood-stricken areas of Hebei Province could not sow in time because the water did not recede in the autumn, and they created a method of sowing wheat during the "79" period (Rain Water solar term), and the harvest was no less than that of autumn wheat, but more than that of spring wheat.
	All of these have played a certain role in increasing grain production.
	North China has achieved great success in promoting superior varieties and advanced production experience. Compared with 1950, the planting area of improved wheat varieties has expanded five or six times, which is very important. Now that people's living standards have improved and the consumption of wheat has increased, it is urgent to increase wheat production. In addition, the planting area of improved corn varieties has expanded more than ten times, and the planting area of improved millet varieties is also gradually expanding. However, compared with the entire grain planting area, the planting area of improved crops is still very small and needs to be expanded more rapidly. Statistics for 1951 show that the planting area of improved wheat varieties is still less than one-fifth of the total wheat planting area. In terms of cultivation techniques, the many new creations of labor models in various regions have not been promoted quickly enough. This situation urgently needs to be changed by expanding publicity and organizing farmers to visit each other.
	From the perspective of industrial production needs, that is, from the needs of the entire country, the planting area of economic crops in North China must be expanded, and the food supply for the people in economic crop areas must be fully supplied, which increases the task of increasing grain production. North China has little land and a large population, and the total area of cultivated land cannot be expanded without limit. Therefore, increasing the yield per unit area has become the central link in increasing grain production. It is hoped that all localities will strive to disseminate and develop this aspect of good experience in order to produce more grain and create a more solid foundation for the development of industrial production.

    提高单位面积产量，生产更多的粮食
    ——华北区城乡物资交流展览会粮食馆介绍
       林韦
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会的材料告诉人们，解放以来，华北区的工业原料作物种植面积扩大了，而粮食的收获量也增加了；这是什么原因呢？这是因为在同一单位面积产量上，生产了更多的粮食，就是说，单位面积增加了。“粮食馆”中的图表，说明了下列数字：以一九五○年与一九四七年相较，华北人民的主要食粮——小米增产了百分之十八，小麦增产了百分之七点五，玉米增产了百分之五十以上。从全国看，我们已经不再是需要进口粮食的国家（像国民党统治时代那样），我们的粮食问题可说已经解决了。综合各地劳动模范的经验，提高单位面积产量的主要关键是选种优良品种，增施肥料，精耕细作（包括采用科学的耕作技术）。
    “粮食馆”介绍了许多由农场实验成功和由农民实验证明有效的优种作物。谷子方面，有产量很高的“华农四号”，“八一一”，“白流沙”，有抗旱力强的“小齐头黄”，有早熟的“边区一号”，以及品质特别好的“沁州黄”，“东方亮”。小麦方面，有产量高抗疸力强的“平原五○”麦，早熟丰产的“蚰子”麦，以及定县“七二”麦，山西
    “一六九麦”，“金裹银麦”等。此外，该馆还介绍了出色的“胜利百号”和“农林四号”甘薯。各地参观的农民，对于这些优良品种，感到特别浓厚的兴趣。
    该馆展出许多劳动模范提高单位面积产量的实例，具体地告诉观众许多提高单位面积产量的方法与经验。河北省徐水县郭云祥种的谷子，一亩能产九百多斤，超过当地一般产量两三倍。其原因：一是种植“华农四号”优良谷种；二是采取科学的施肥方法，即用耠子破开五寸宽、三寸深的沟，把土粪六千四百斤和压碎的胡麻饼一百斤，均匀地撒在沟内；三是密植，即顺着施肥的沟，每亩撒种三斤，并撒信谷半斤当毒饵，防治蝼蛄；四是间苗和定苗得法，即苗长一二寸时，间一次苗，密的间稀，弱的拔去，苗高四、五寸时，每隔两三寸交错留苗一株，一尺内留苗七八株；五是中耕除草相宜，即在间苗后，浅锄一遍；苗高一尺多时，锄二遍，将草除净，莠穗前再锄一次；六是勤浇水：开花时勤浇，要小水，抽穗时浇大水。由于这些措施得宜，他的谷子长的特别强，茎秆粗，高五尺六寸，穗长七、八寸到一尺。
    山西平顺县李顺达，一亩玉米收获九百八十斤，也比普通产量大两三倍，他丰产的原因是：一、种植“金皇后”优良品种；二、秋季收获谷子后，先浅耕灭茬，地冻前深耕翻土，将心土耕起，经冬日曝晒，使心土变成熟土，春季解冻时耙碎土块，立夏前播种，每穴播三、四粒；三、每亩施羊粪一百担做基肥，每穴再浇少许稀薄的人粪尿，盖土踏平；四、苗高四、五寸时间苗除草，株距二尺，行距二尺半，每亩一千一百余棵，苗高二尺半时，每亩施大粪二十担，做追肥；五、头次锄地时细锄，二次深锄，三次松地皮埋土；六、成熟时实行田间选种。
    平原省去年先旱后涝，小麦种得晚，出苗一般都不很好。但是，该省武陟县李文通种的小麦，每亩平均仍收获五百四十四斤。原因是他选用了修武县的优良品种“半截芒”麦；犁二次，耙十五遍；每亩用五千斤圈粪及一百五十斤绿豆渣作基肥，今年二月每亩又上了一百五十斤绿豆渣作追肥；按时锄地，浇水。
    河北昌黎县马国荣去年种“胜利百号”甘薯，折合一亩地收一万斤。甘薯成熟时，每穴薯块都互相连接，把生地都挤裂了缝。他的种植方法是：一、在育苗时坚持少加水、慢加火，使苗生长适时，因此，各炕所出种苗都很健壮；二、集中施用肥料：在七分半的甘薯地上，施用老房土三千多斤，并且都集中撒在垄沟内，因此，能使肥料的效力充分发挥出来，收到多施肥料的好处；三、管理方法：以犁作垄，在旧历四月初用二楂苗座水栽秧，中耕一次，耪一次，有草就拔，并未翻蔓。
    此外，粮食馆还介绍了农民与自然环境做斗争的优秀榜样。察哈尔省气候很冷，过去人们都认为不能种冬麦。但是，宣化县的王有富采用提前播种、多加种子、多加肥料、深耕地、灌冬水的办法，终于试种冬麦成功，收获比春麦多一倍。河北省水灾区有些农民，因秋天水落不下去，不能及时播种，创造了七九时（雨水节）种麦的办法，收获量不比秋麦少，但较春麦多。
    所有这些，都对粮食的增产起了一定的作用。
    华北区在推广优良品种和先进生产经验方面，已经获得很大成绩。以一九五一年与一九五○年比较，良种小麦的种植面积扩大了五、六倍，这是非常重要的。现在人民生活改善，食用小麦数量增多，亟应增加小麦的产量。此外，良种玉米的种植面积扩大了十倍多，良种谷子的种植面积也在逐渐扩大。但是，和整个粮食耕种面积比起来，良种作物的种植面积还是很小的，需要更迅速地扩大。一九五一年统计，良种小麦的种植面积还不及全部小麦种植面积的五分之一。在耕作技术方面，各地劳动模范们的许多新创造，也还推广得不够快，这种情形，急需以扩大宣传和组织农民互相参观的方法加以改变。
    从工业生产的需要说，也就是从整个国家的需要说，华北区经济作物的种植面积还要扩大，而经济作物地区人民的食粮，必须充分供应，这就加重了粮食增产任务。华北地少人多，耕地总面积不可能无限制地扩大，因此，提高单位面积产量，就成为增产粮食的中心环节。希望各地努力传播并发展这一方面的优良经验，以便生产更多的粮食，为发展工业生产创造更加雄厚坚实的基础。
