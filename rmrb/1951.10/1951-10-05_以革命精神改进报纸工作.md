    Improving Newspaper Work with Revolutionary Spirit

    Strengthening the ideological character of newspapers and strengthening the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are decisive links in improving newspaper work. This is because many newspaper editors, although working hard to run newspapers in the past, did not fully understand that the nature of newspaper work is fundamentally ideological work. The task of newspapers is to use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to conduct ideological education in various tasks, and to sharply launch ideological struggles to eliminate various reactionary thoughts and criticize various erroneous thoughts. Therefore, our ideological work on the news front is far from keeping up with the needs of revolutionary work.

    In response to this situation, in the past two months, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee have successively convened newspaper work conferences in various provinces and cities. According to the materials obtained at these conferences, it is proved that there is a common basic weakness in the newspaper work in these regions, that is, due to the tendency of empiricism, detachment from the masses, and neglect of politics in newspaper editorial departments, the ideological struggle carried out in newspapers is weak and powerless.

    When criticizing this weakness, the Northeast and North China newspaper work conferences pointed out that many newspapers introduce work experience and methods in isolation, and one-sidedly educate the masses with the economic interests of the masses in front of them, failing to link today's labor with a better life in the future, and to link the part with the whole. Therefore, there is a bias towards separating from political content and simply publicizing economic affairs, separating from national interests and one-sidedly emphasizing personal interests, or reluctantly "linking" general political slogans with specific work. In terms of popularization, some reports reflecting the lives of working people are still mostly in the tone of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, permeated with the feelings of non-working people. This shows that the propaganda work of newspapers must undergo a fundamental change with a revolutionary spirit, so that the newspapers can take on a new look.

    The newspaper work conferences held in the above-mentioned regions are precisely an important step to change this situation in accordance with the spirit of the First National Propaganda Work Conference of the CPC Central Committee. Therefore, the convening of these conferences and the discussion of the nature and tasks of newspaper work, as well as the decisions made by local party committees on newspaper work, are of decisive significance for improving newspapers and strengthening the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. All newspaper editorial departments in these regions should resolutely implement and realize the decisions of these conferences with a revolutionary spirit. Newspaper editorial departments in regions where newspaper work conferences have not been held should also combine their own situations to make a fundamental change in the nature of newspaper work.

    以革命精神改进报纸工作
    加强报纸的思想性，加强报纸对马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的宣传，是提高报纸工作的决定性的环节。因为许多报纸编辑部的工作人员，过去虽在努力办报，但并不完全了解报纸工作的性质基本上是思想工作，报纸的任务是用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，在各项工作中进行思想教育，并尖锐地展开思想斗争，以肃清各种反动思想，批判各种错误思想。因而，我们在新闻战线上的思想工作，还远远赶不上革命工作的需要。
    针对这种情况，最近两月来，中共中央东北局宣传部、中共中央华北局宣传部、中共中央中南局先后召开了各省市报纸工作会议。根据在这些会议上得到的材料，证明各该地区的报纸工作中都存在着一个共同的基本的弱点，即由于报纸编辑部存在着经验主义、脱离群众、忽视政治的倾向，以致在报纸所进行的思想斗争中，表现出贫弱无力的状况。
    东北、华北报纸工作会议在批判这一弱点时，曾指出：许多报纸孤立地介绍工作经验与工作方法，片面地以群众眼前的经济利益教育群众，不能把今天的劳动与明天的更美满的生活联系起来，把局部和全局联系起来。因而，有脱离政治内容而单纯宣传经济事务，脱离国家利益而片面强调个人利益，或把一般的政治口号勉强“联系”具体工作的偏向。在通俗化方面，某些反映劳动群众生活的报道，还多是小资产阶级知识分子的腔调，渗透着非劳动人民的感情。这说明报纸的宣传工作，必须以革命的精神来一个根本性的改变，使报纸面貌一新。
    上述地区所召开的报纸工作会议，就正是根据中共中央第一次全国宣传工作会议的精神，来改变这种状况的一个重要步骤。因此，这些会议的召开和对报纸工作性质、任务的讨论，以及当地党委对报纸工作所作的决定等等，都对提高报纸加强马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的宣传，具有决定意义。各该地区的所有报纸编辑部，即应以革命的精神坚决贯彻和实现这些会议的决定。没召开报纸工作会议的地区的报纸编辑部，亦应结合自己的情况，把报纸工作来一个根本性质的改变。
