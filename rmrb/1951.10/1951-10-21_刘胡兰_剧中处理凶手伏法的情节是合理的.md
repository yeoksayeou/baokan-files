    A brief review of cultural life

    The handling of the scene of the murderer being brought to justice in the play "Liu Hulan" is reasonable.
    According to letters from readers Gao Guiping, Wan Rongzhi, Yixiao, Dai Zhuang, and four others from this newspaper, as well as readers' letters from the Shanxi Daily, after the news that Zhang Quanbao, the "Big Beard" murderer who killed Liu Hulan, had been brought to justice was published, some readers believed that the depiction in the opera "Liu Hulan" of "Big Beard" being killed when our army liberated Wenshui City in Shanxi was inconsistent with the fact that "Big Beard" Zhang Quanbao was brought to justice today, and therefore doubted the authenticity of the opera. This doubt is unnecessary. Because the opera "Liu Hulan" is based on Liu Hulan's life and her heroic deeds, concentrating and summarizing the heroic typical of the Chinese people through artistic expression. As everyone knows, the task of a true realistic artist is by no means limited to describing what has already happened, but to be good at grasping what is developing and at foreseeing possible future prospects from the development of reality. In the opera "Liu Hulan," the depiction of "Big Beard" being killed when our army liberated Wenshui City in Shanxi was entirely possible at that time and later - facts prove that although "Big Beard" was not killed at that time, he was finally caught and brought to justice. The handling of this issue in the opera at that time was completely correct, because it not only satisfied the people's desire for revenge, but also conformed to the laws of historical development. However, there is a kind of erroneous view that often confuses a specific historical fact with artistic authenticity, requiring that the plot expressed in art be completely consistent with the details of certain specific facts. On June 25th, the Shanxi Daily, in the form of "Answers to Readers' Questions," expressed this incorrect view when answering questions raised by readers of the newspaper. The editors believed that the opera shot "Big Beard," but today "Big Beard" has been caught again, "which shows that our investigation work was not meticulous enough at that time." This answer is wrong. The editors of the newspaper narrowly understood artistic truth as a mechanical reproduction of various facts. What he called the "essence of 'seeking truth from facts'" is nothing more than completely confining art to the circle of real people and real events, and canceling the scientific predictive description in art, which is completely wrong.

### “刘胡兰”剧中处理凶手伏法的情节是合理的

    “刘胡兰”剧中处理凶手伏法的情节是合理的
    根据本报读者高贵萍、万荣知、一笑、戴庄等七人分别来信及山西日报读者来信反映，自报载杀害刘胡兰的凶手大胡子张全宝伏法的消息后，有些读者认为在“刘胡兰”歌剧中，当我军解放山西文水城时“大胡子”被击毙的描写，与今天“大胡子”张全宝伏法的事实不符，因此对该歌剧的真实性发生怀疑。这种怀疑是不必要的。因为“刘胡兰”歌剧是根据刘胡兰的生平和她的英雄事迹，集中地、概括地用艺术表现出了中国人民的英雄典型。如众所知，一个真正的现实主义的艺术家的任务，决不仅限于描写已经发生的事情，而是要善于掌握正在发展中的和善于从现实的发展中预见未来可能出现的远景。“刘胡兰”歌剧里，描写“大胡子”在我军解放山西文水城时被击毙，在当时和以后都是完全可能发生的事情，——事实证明虽然当时“大胡子”没有被击毙，现在终于落网伏法。当时歌剧中对此问题的处理，是完全正确的，因为它不但满足了人民群众复仇的愿望，而且也符合历史发展的规律。但有种错误的看法，往往把历史上的某一件具体事实与艺术的真实性混为一谈，要求艺术上所表现的情节和某些具体事实的细节完全一致。六月二十五日山西日报上，编者以“答读者问”的形式，答复该报读者提出的这个问题时，就表现了这种不正确的观点。编者认为，歌剧中枪毙了“大胡子”，而今天又抓到了“大胡子”，“这说明当时我们的调查工作还不细致”。这种答复是错误的。该报编者把艺术的真实，狭隘地理解为各种事实机械的再现。他所谓“‘实事求是’的本质”，无非是把艺术完全禁闭在真人真事的圈子里，取消了艺术中科学的预见性的描写，这是完全不对的。
