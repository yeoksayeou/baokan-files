Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 24th: October 25th marks the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war. Our front-line reporter interviewed the spokesman of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters, who agreed to meet and answer the reporter's questions as follows:

    Question: What victories have the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army achieved since fighting side by side for a year? How do you estimate the significance of the victory?

    Answer: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea last October under the serious circumstances of the American armed aggressors extending the flames of war to our country's northeastern border, and engaged in heroic and resourceful operations against the aggressors together with the Korean People's Army. Over the past year, the Korean-Chinese People's Armies have won significant victories through five large-scale campaigns and the ongoing attrition warfare that inflicts heavy casualties on the enemy, eliminating a total of 387,148 enemy troops, driving the aggressors from the south bank of the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, liberating vast territories in northern Korea, and laying a solid foundation for final victory.

    The significance of this victory, I think, is undoubtedly very great. Because of the victory, the vast people of northern Korea were rescued from the cruel slaughter of the invading army, and they can still live freely on their own homeland. Factories are gradually recovering production from the destruction of the invaders, and crops are growing again in the fields. By victoriously crushing the U.S. imperialist's evil plan to destroy Korea and invade mainland China, we have laid the foundation for the liberation of Korea and safeguarded the security of our motherland, and greatly encouraged the victorious confidence of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world in opposing war and defending peace. The experience of the anti-aggression war over the past year proves that U.S. imperialism is not to be feared and can be completely defeated. In the course of fighting against the enemy, the Korean-Chinese People's Armies have undergone tremendous training, absorbed rich new practical experience, and become an invincible force.

    Question: What are the basic reasons for the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army?

    Answer: The basic reason for the victory of the Korean-Chinese People's Armies is that they are not waging any other war, but a just war against imperialist armed aggression, defending the motherland, and defending Asian and world peace. Precisely because of this, the commanders and fighters of the Korean-Chinese People's Armies are able to fight the enemy selflessly, the people of China and Korea are able to fully support the front lines, and peace-loving people all over the world can provide the Korean-Chinese People's Armies with material and moral assistance. This is the advantage of the Korean-Chinese People's Armies, and this advantage will always play a positive role. The American armed aggressors have repeatedly suffered these failures because they are waging an unjust war of aggression, which is not only resolutely resisted by the Chinese and Korean people, but also opposed by the people of the world. The soldiers of the invading army are unwilling to sacrifice their lives for the enrichment of Wall Street monopoly capitalists. As the invading army continues to suffer losses, the war drags on, and the deception of the warmongers is gradually exposed, the war-weariness of the invading army soldiers will deepen. An army with low morale is bound to fail. Secondly, the U.S. imperialists' frantic pursuit of war and preparation to implement wartime economic policies will aggravate the factors of its economic crisis and lead to the bankruptcy of the national economy. In this case, the U.S. aggressors will infinitely increase the burden of war expenses on their domestic people, making them gradually lose their livelihood guarantees, and thus causing and intensifying their struggle against the war of aggression and demanding peace. Third, with the continuous failure of the war of aggression, the future of the war of aggression is becoming increasingly bleak for the aggressors. Precisely because of this, all kinds of differences arise within the U.S. ruling clique and within the imperialist camp, and their mutual attacks and quarrels will inevitably increase. All of these are fundamental and insurmountable weaknesses for the U.S. aggressors.

    Question: If the United States disregards the desire for peace of the people of the world, undermines the Korean armistice negotiations, and insists on the war of aggression against Korea, what kind of consequences will it incur?

    Answer: The Korean and Chinese people have always advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. The purpose of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entering Korea is to defend the motherland and defend peace. Therefore, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are willing to negotiate with the United States on the Korean War and are willing to implement a Korean armistice on fair and reasonable terms. However, if U.S. imperialism disregards the desire for peace of the people of the world, undermines the Korean armistice negotiations, and insists on the war of aggression, then there is no doubt that it will only continue to suffer setbacks until its final defeat, and there will be no other result. The enormous losses suffered by the U.S. aggressors in the so-called "Summer Limited Objectives Offensive" and the currently ongoing so-called "Autumn Offensive" already illustrate this point. The Korean-Chinese People's Armies have been vigilant against the enemy's conspiracy to undermine the armistice negotiations and are prepared to strive for the victorious end of the Korean War with the determination to fight a long-term war.

    中国人民志愿军发言人发表谈话
    朝中人民军队奋战一年已奠定最后胜利的巩固基础
    如果美国破坏谈判必将继续遭受打击直到最后失败
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】十月二十五日是中国人民志愿军出国作战的一周年纪念日，本社前线记者特走访中国人民志愿军司令部发言人，承接见并答复记者所提诸问题如下：
    问：中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战一年以来取得了怎样的胜利？你对胜利意义的估计怎样？
    答：中国人民志愿军在去年十月美国武装侵略者将战火烧到我国东北边境的严重情况下进入朝鲜，与朝鲜人民军在一起向侵略者进行英勇机智的作战。一年以来，朝中人民军队经过五次大规模的战役和目前还在进行着的杀伤大量敌军的阻击战，已经赢得了重大的胜利，共计消灭敌军三十八万七千
    一百四十八名，将侵略者由鸭绿江南岸逐退到三八线附近，解放了朝鲜北部的广大土地，奠定了最后胜利的巩固基础。
    这个胜利的意义，我想无疑地是很伟大的。由于胜利，朝鲜北部广大人民从侵略军的残酷屠杀下挽救出来了，他们仍能自由地生活在自己的祖国土地上，工厂从侵略者的破坏中逐渐恢复生产，田地里重新生长起五谷。由于胜利地粉碎了美帝国主义灭亡朝鲜和侵略中国大陆的罪恶计划，这就打下了朝鲜解放的基础和保卫了我们祖国的安全，且大大地鼓舞了中朝人民和世界人民反对战争，保卫和平的胜利信心。一年来反侵略作战的经验证明：美帝国主义是不可怕的，是完全可以打败的。朝中人民军队在对敌作战中，经受了巨大的锻炼，吸收了丰富的新的实战经验，愈战愈强，成为一支不可战胜的力量。
    问：中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军取得胜利的基本原因是什么？
    答：朝中人民军队取得胜利的基本原因是在于他们所进行的不是任何别的战争，而是反对帝国主义武装侵略、保卫祖国、保卫亚洲与世界和平的正义战争，正因为这样，所以朝中人民军队的指战员能够奋不顾身地和敌人作战，朝中两国人民能够全力地支援前线，全世界爱好和平的人民能予朝中人民军队以物质和道义上的援助，这就是朝中人民军队所具有的优势，而这种优势是永远起积极作用的。美国武装侵略者不断地遭到这些失败，这因为它所进行的是非正义的侵略战争，它不仅遭到朝中人民的坚决反击，也遭到全世界人民的反对。侵略军士兵是不愿为华尔街垄断资本家发财而白送性命的，随着侵略军不断地遭受损失，战争的旷日持久，以及战争贩子的欺骗之被逐渐揭穿，侵略军士兵的厌战情绪会愈益加深。士气低落的军队是一定要失败的。其次，美帝国主义疯狂地进行战争，准备施行战时经济政策的结果，将加重其经济危机的因素和招致国家财政经济的破产。在这种情况下，美国侵略者将无限度地加重其国内人民的战费负担，使他们逐渐失去生活的保障，因而会引起和加剧他们进行反对侵略战争与要求和平的斗争。第三，随着侵略战争的不断失败，侵略战争的前途对于侵略者是愈来愈暗淡了。正因为这样，美国统治集团的内部和帝国主义阵营的内部产生着种种分歧，他们的互相攻讦和争吵，必然增加。以上这些对美国侵略者来说，都是其根本的不可克服的弱点。
    问：如果美国不顾全世界人民要求和平的愿望，破坏朝鲜停战谈判，坚持侵朝战争，那末它会招致何种结果？
    答：朝中人民是从来主张和平解决朝鲜问题的。中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜，其目的即在保卫祖国和保卫和平。所以我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军愿意和美国进行朝鲜战争谈判，并愿意在公平合理的条件上实行朝鲜停战。但是，如果美国帝国主义不顾全世界人民要求和平的愿望，破坏朝鲜停战谈判，坚持侵略战争，那么毫无疑问，除了它继续遭受打击直到最后失败以外，是决不会有其他结果的。美国侵略者发动的所谓“夏季有限目标攻势”，和目前正在进行着的所谓“秋季攻势”所遭受的巨大损失，已经可以说明了这一点。朝中人民军队一直在警惕着敌人破坏停战谈判的阴谋，并准备以长期作战的决心，来争取朝鲜战争的胜利结束。
