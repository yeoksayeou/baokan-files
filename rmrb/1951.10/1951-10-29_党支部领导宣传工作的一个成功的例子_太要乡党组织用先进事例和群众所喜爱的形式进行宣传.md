    A Successful Example of Party Branch Leadership in Propaganda Work
    Taiyao Township Party Organization Uses Advanced Examples and Forms Beloved by the Masses for Propaganda
    The Taiyao Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Tongguan County, Shaanxi Province, organized all propaganda forces in the township. Targeting the ideological situation of farmers at each stage, it used advanced examples from among the masses and forms that the masses loved to see and hear for propaganda, achieving great results.
    The CCP branch in the township has five propagandists and leads 39 reading groups, 11 blackboards, three "native movies," seven "native broadcasts," and two amateur music bands (a type of entertainment organization of farmers involving singing and playing) to carry out various propaganda activities.
    After the land reform this spring, the production enthusiasm of the farmers in Taiyao Township was very high. At that time, it was the spring famine, and it was necessary to mobilize women to go to the fields to weed the wheat in order to free up some male laborers for sideline production. However, the local custom in the past was:
    "Men travel across states and counties, women revolve around the pot," and few women went to the fields. The CCP branch in the township organized folk artists to compose a clapper talk:
    "As long as women are determined, they work stronger than men;
    There are female township heads in the government, and even more female committee members;
    Famous heroine Guo Junqing, and model Zhao Guilan."
    This clapper talk began to move the women in the township. But their confidence in going to the fields to produce was not enough. Shan Xiuzhen, a female propagandist and production model in Taiyao Township, personally taught women production techniques. The reading group and the people's school also talked about the deeds of Liang Xiuying, a female labor model in northern Shaanxi, so the number of women going to the fields gradually increased. For example, women weeded more than 600 acres of the 900 acres of wheat fields in Madian Village, thus freeing up more than 30 men, allowing them to cut 60,000 kilograms of firewood without worry, sell it to exchange for grain, and solve the grain shortage during the spring famine in the whole village.
    There were several female hooligans in the township, some even addicted to drugs and trafficking, who had not improved after repeated persuasion and detention and education by the People's Government. The propagandists and amateur music band adapted the deeds of these people into a drama called "Female Hooligans Turn Over a New Leaf" and performed it publicly in the township. The content of the play was about how the old society lured a woman into drug addiction and onto a dead end; the Communist Party came to save her, distributed land to her, and educated her to participate in production, making her a labor model. This drama deeply moved the female hooligans such as He Lianwa. After watching the play, they not only quit smoking and went to the fields to work, but also made more than 60 pairs of hemp shoes and sold them to tide over the spring famine. The propagandists also used the principle of "Three diligences plus one laziness, even lazy people can be made to produce" to persuade the members of the labor mutual aid groups to include He Lianwa and others in the groups, so that they could completely transform.
    In order to make everyone understand the reason for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the township held several mass meetings for propaganda before the "May 1st" holiday. After the propagandists spoke at the meeting and asked everyone if they understood, everyone present said they understood. But when asked after the meeting, they couldn't talk about it. So the propagandists selected an activist from every five households, gathered them together to discuss the propaganda materials, and then these activists carried out propaganda to each household and person. In addition, the anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea clapper talk compiled by folk artists was copied and given to each household. Later, from teenagers to people in their fifties and sixties in the whole township understood the reason for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
    After the patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign began, the CCP branch in the township mobilized the heads of labor mutual aid groups, students of people's schools, and all activists in the countryside to participate in this propaganda, and quickly made it known to every household. But some people were still afraid that storing cotton would make it inconvenient to use money; some people were afraid that the scales of the cooperative were unfair. At this time, the "native broadcast" station and the blackboard newspaper also spread the clapper talk of folk artists: "Willing to store or sell as you wish, deposits and withdrawals can be made in whole or in part, it is convenient to use money sooner or later..." to mobilize farmers to sell and store cotton. The women's reading groups also drew "native movie" pictures according to the comic strip "Zhao Baoshan Stores Cotton" published in the newspaper. On the night the "native movie" was shown, every household locked their doors to watch. The propagandists explained to everyone on the spot how Zhao Baoshan understood the principle of selling and storing cotton to love the country. After listening, everyone immediately discussed: "The People's Government calls for selling and storing cotton for the good of the people, how can we not respond!" Later, the farmers automatically put forward the slogan of "Pick, dry, gin, and sell at the same time." When they sold cotton, they repeatedly urged the collection station: "If you were not collecting on behalf of the government, we wouldn't sell!" Liu Shunli, a farmer in Wancang Village, ran to the cooperative to call someone to weigh the cotton before dawn in order to sell cotton early. He said: "No matter how high the price is elsewhere, we won't sell. We sell to the government so that the yarn factory can produce more, and the volunteers can also wear warm clothes to fight the American aggressors!" In this way, in half a month, the farmers in the whole township sold 2,600 kilograms of new cotton to the cooperative.

    党支部领导宣传工作的一个成功的例子
    太要乡党组织用先进事例和群众所喜爱的形式进行宣传
    中国共产党陕西省潼关县太要乡支部组织了全乡各种宣传力量，针对农民每一时期的思想情况，用群众中的先进事例和群众所喜见乐闻的形式进行宣传，收到很大的效果。
    该乡中共支部有五个宣传员，并领导着三十九个读报组、十一块黑板报、三处“土电影”、七处“土广播”和两个自乐班（农民中一种唱奏的娱乐组织）进行各种宣传活动。
    今春土地改革后，太要乡农民的生产情绪很高，当时正值春荒，必须动员妇女下地锄麦，以便抽出一部分男劳动力作副业生产。可是当地过去的习俗是：
    “男人走州又走县，女人围着锅边转”，很少有妇女下地的。该乡中共支部就组织民间艺人编了一首快板：
    “女人只要下决心，干活强似男子汉；
    政府里有女乡长，更有许多女委员；
    驰名英雄郭俊卿，还有模范赵桂兰。”
    这首快板开始打动了乡里的妇女。但是她们对下地生产的信心还不够。太要乡女宣传员、乡生产模范山秀珍就亲自教妇女们生产技术。读报组和民校里又讲陕北女劳动模范梁秀英的事迹，于是妇女下地的逐渐增多。如马店村的九百多亩麦田中就由妇女锄了六百多亩，这样共换出了三十多个男人，使他们心无牵挂地砍了六万多斤柴，卖出去换回粮食，解决了全村春荒中的缺粮困难。
    乡里原有几个女二流子，有的甚至吸毒贩毒，经大家一再劝说，并由人民政府管押教育，还没有改好。宣传员和自乐班就把这几个人的事迹编成了一出“女二流子改邪归正”的戏，在乡里公演。戏的内容是叙述旧社会如何引诱一个女人染上烟毒，走上绝路；共产党来了救了她，分给她土地，教育她参加生产，使她成为一个劳动模范。这个戏剧深深感动了女二流子贺连娃等。她们在看戏以后，不仅戒了烟，下地劳动，还做了六十多双麻鞋，卖了钱度过春荒。宣传员又以“三勤加一懒，管教懒人也生产”的道理，说服了各劳动互助组组员，把贺连娃等都编在组内，使她们彻底转变过来。
    为了使人人都懂得抗美援朝的道理，乡里在“五一”节以前曾召集过几次群众大会，进行宣传。宣传员在会上讲过以后问大家懂了没有，到会的都说懂了。但会后一问，都谈不上来。于是宣传员又在每五户中选出一个积极分子，把他们集中起来讨论宣传材料，以后再由这些积极分子对每户每人进行宣传。另外又把民间艺人编的抗美援朝快板，抄写给各户。以后，全乡从十多岁的孩子到五、六十岁的老人都懂得了抗美援朝的道理。
    爱国售棉储棉运动开始后，该乡中共支部动员了劳动互助组组长、民校学员和农村中所有积极分子参加了这次宣传，很快就做到了家喻户晓。但仍有人怕存储了棉花，用钱不方便；有人怕合作社的秤不公平。这时“土广播”站和黑板报上又传播了民间艺人的快板：“愿存愿卖随人意，零整存取都可以，早晚用钱都便利……”来动员农民售储棉。各妇女读报组又按报上登载的“赵保善存棉花”的连环画，绘制了“土电影”画片。在“土电影”放映的那天晚上，家家户户都锁了门来看。宣传员就当场向大家讲解赵保善怎么懂得了售棉储棉爱国的道理。大家听了，马上议论起来：“人民政府号召售储棉花都是为了人民好，咱怎能不响应！”以后农民自动提出了“边拾、边晒、边轧、边卖”的口号。他们在卖棉时并再三叮嘱代收站：“你们要不是替政府代收，咱可不卖！”万仓村农民刘顺利为了赶早卖棉，天还没亮就跑到合作社去叫人过秤。他说：“别处给的价再高，咱也不卖。咱卖给政府，纱厂可以多生产，志愿军也可以穿暖了去打美国侵略者！”这样，在半个月里，全乡农民卖给合作社的新棉就有二千六百斤。
