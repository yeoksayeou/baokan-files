Strengthening the Study of Marriage Law by District and Township Cadres
Li Zheng

For more than a year, the Marriage Law has achieved great success in its implementation across the country, and the broad masses have won a great victory in the struggle against the feudal marriage system. A crucial reason for these achievements and victories is the correct leadership of party organizations and governments at all levels, especially the correct propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law by the majority of district and township (village) cadres. However, in this great victory, the masses have also paid a great price, with excessive casualties in some places. For instance, in the Central South region alone, as many as 10,000 women were killed or forced to commit suicide due to marital issues in one year. This is an alarming number. There have also been many cases of killings and suicides in other regions. On the one hand, this is because the remnants of the feudal marriage system still exist seriously in the vast countryside. On the other hand, it is also because many district and township cadres still harbor strong feudal consciousness and have bad work styles, directly or indirectly protecting the remnants of the feudal marriage system and hindering the implementation of the Marriage Law.

The feudal consciousness of district and township cadres is mainly manifested in the following points: "Fear of widespread chaos." After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, district and township cadres in Liaodong and Heilongjiang in the Northeast, Pingyuan and Hebei in North China, Shandong and Zhejiang in East China, and many other regions generally showed a reluctance to promote the Marriage Law. Some village cadres in Liaodong feared that promoting the Marriage Law would delay the masses' production. Some village cadres in Pingyuan Province locked the Marriage Law in their drawers after receiving it. In Zhejiang Province, individual village cadres even said: "Whoever promotes the Marriage Law in my village will have their legs broken!" Because cadres were afraid to promote it, the masses naturally could not understand the spirit of the Marriage Law; and illegal landlords and certain bad elements took the opportunity to maliciously slander, distort, and defame the new Marriage Law, saying that the Marriage Law was a "divorce law" and that "the government wants to launch a divorce movement," and so on. As a result, some people became afraid of the Marriage Law. Therefore, when some places held meetings to promote the Marriage Law, the masses did not allow young women to participate because they were "afraid of being mobilized to divorce." "Male chauvinism" in handling divorce cases. They believe that divorce would be disadvantageous to men, leaving them "empty-handed." Therefore, they imposed various restrictions on women who requested divorce, and even openly interfered unreasonably. Lu Zhichun of Liujia Village, Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, filed for divorce from her husband, and her husband colluded with township cadres to lock her up, beat her severely, and force her to agree to the following four conditions: 1. Not allowed to divorce, not allowed to live with her parents for three years; 2. Must ask for permission from parents-in-law and husband to relieve herself; 3. Not allowed to talk to anyone in her parents' village; 4. Must report to the women's representative meeting before leaving the village. If these harsh conditions were violated, she would be punished by "drinking three bowls of manure." "Male chauvinism" was also extremely unreasonable in handling the issue of women bringing property in divorce. When dealing with the issue of women bringing property, many district cadres and county people's court cadres even advocated "bring less rather than more, and better not bring anything at all." Several district people's governments in Yuci County, Shanxi, even arbitrarily stipulated that the principle of bringing property was: "Women who initiate divorce do not bring anything; men who initiate divorce can bring something." As a result, some women had to remarry their original husbands because they had no means of living after the divorce, and they returned to their original painful lives.

Using old moral concepts to deal with divorce disputes. They believe that divorce is a "bad thing," "shameful," and "breaks up families." When mediating divorce disputes, many district cadres always persuade reconciliation rather than divorce. In this way, mediation becomes persuasion of the woman (most of the time, it is the woman who files for divorce). A couple in Junan County, Shandong Province, voluntarily divorced, but the district government did not approve it. On the way home from the district government, the couple found a land temple and divorced in front of the "Land God." Many women in many places said: "Divorce requires passing three levels: the village level, the district level, and the county level. The village level is the hardest to pass."

Conniving at and supporting the old marriage system and resisting the Marriage Law. Although there are fewer people like this, their harm is great. This is manifested in arranged marriages, forced marriages, beating women, secretly buying wives with money, or profiting from brokering marriages for others, or other illegal behaviors. Some district cadres in Xing County, Shanxi Province, acted as matchmakers for arranged marriages. In a village in Tunliu County, Changzhi Prefecture, a public security officer, because he was not old enough to marry, feared that the government would not approve it, so he found someone to register in his place, and only changed it to himself when "worshipping the flower hall." This group of people has the strongest feudal consciousness, and they cause the greatest harm to the masses.

In addition to the above-mentioned feudal consciousness, there are also several other incorrect views and work styles among many district and township cadres.

One is a narrow perspective of poor and lower-middle peasants. In order to "protect the interests of poor and lower-middle peasants," many district and township cadres, regardless of the circumstances, refused to allow the wives of poor and lower-middle peasants to divorce. The wife of a poor peasant in Maoyingzi Village, Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, wanted to divorce her husband, but the district chief did not approve it, and detained both the man and woman for more than ten days, forcing them to have sexual relations before releasing them. As a result, the woman committed suicide by drinking brine. A couple in Zhangjiakou City, widely different in age and with poor feelings, the woman filed for divorce, the district cadres said: "No need to divorce, you see your husband is a worker, earning money to support you, it is not easy." Did not approve. A few days later, the woman disappeared, leaving the man with a baby. In this way, both the woman and the man were harmed.

Another is indifference to the marital problems of the masses, believing that implementing the Marriage Law is a matter for women. Some district cadres in Hang County, Zhejiang Province, handle marriage issues extremely carelessly, spending no more than half an hour dealing with divorce cases or registering marriages. Some places have adopted an attitude of "responding to every request" for divorce. Some couples were approved for divorce by the government simply because of a momentary quarrel; as a result, they soon requested to restore the marital relationship.

Still another is serious bureaucracy and administrative commandism. Some district and village cadres in Shanxi Province adopted the method of confiscating betrothal gifts and detaining people for the buying and selling of marriages of the masses. In Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province, four of the eight marriage disputes handled by a certain district chief, Xie, and township chief, Luo, since the promulgation of the Marriage Law until the end of last year were resolved by binding them. Some places held mass struggle meetings to resolve issues of male-female relations, resulting in death.

Because many district and township (village) cadres have the above-mentioned feudal consciousness and bad work styles, the masses cannot get strong support in the struggle against the feudal marriage system, which allows the residual feudal marriage system to be preserved in many places, and the new Marriage Law cannot meet the masses in some areas.

The basic reason why many district and township cadres have this kind of thinking and work style is that they have been influenced by feudal ideology for a long time and have not been severely criticized. Most district and township cadres have only recently left their families, or are still semi-detached from production or not detached from production. Their level of awareness is not very high, and the feudal patriarchal ideas of "clan power" and "husband power" have not been eliminated. Therefore, in the sharp struggle between the peasant class and the landlord class to oppose the feudal land system, they move forward bravely without fear; however, the struggle to overthrow the old marriage system is a struggle between the progressive and backward ideas within the peasants, and once the Marriage Law is implemented, the relationship between men and women will undergo tremendous changes, and the old family relationship will gradually change, and the feudal marriage system, the old relationship between men and women, they are accustomed to, so they are unwilling to accept, and even resist the Marriage Law. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the leading organs in some areas have not given enough ideological education to district and township cadres, especially township (village) cadres, especially on the Marriage Law. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, all localities once paid attention to carrying out the education work of the Marriage Law to the district and township cadres, so that most of the district and township cadres initially understood the spirit of the Marriage Law; however, the regular ideological education and policy guidance in this aspect is very insufficient. Around the first anniversary of the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the relevant departments of the Central Committee organized an investigation group on the implementation of the Marriage Law to investigate in Shanxi. The investigation group went to several places in Shanxi and found two situations: one is that there are many problems in the lower level (district, township), and the upper level (county and above) provides less guidance and assistance; one is that the civil affairs department should do the most work in implementing the Marriage Law, but it pays the least attention to this work. For example, since the promulgation of the Marriage Law until March of this year, the Fourth District of Yuci County, Shanxi Province, handled a total of about 400 marriage registrations and divorce cases, of which 30 marriage cases were sent to the court for handling, and the rest were handled in the district government. Due to the above-mentioned several disconnections, therefore, the policy and ideology of many district and township cadres cannot be improved, and they have inadvertently made many mistakes. The investigation group simply tested 15 village cadres in Zhang Village, Fourth District of Yuci, and found that 9 of them did not know what the Marriage Law was, including the civil education committee member and the vice chairman of the women's representative meeting; 6 of them vaguely knew that the Marriage Law was "free marriage, free divorce, the age of marriage for men is 20 years old, and the age of marriage for women is 18 years old." From here, even if the cadres have no feudal consciousness, the Marriage Law is difficult to implement well among the masses. Therefore, strengthening the study of the Marriage Law by district and township cadres is the top priority in implementing the Marriage Law.

How to do this work well?

1.  Local party organizations should make education on the Marriage Law one of the regular contents of ideological education for rural branch members. In many areas, Party members account for the majority of the main cadres in the village. Past experience in various places has proved that the marriage policy is better implemented where the party organization pays attention to leadership. The main reason why democratic and harmonious families in Baiyangyu Village, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, account for more than half of the total number of households in the village and a new marriage system has been basically established is that the party branch can correctly lead and most party members can understand the spirit of the Marriage Law and set an example.
2.  Governments at all levels, especially county people's governments, should strengthen policy guidance to district and township government cadres, and help solve specific difficulties, improve the ideological and professional level of cadres, in order to reduce errors. It is not right for the leading cadres of the county to only manage the current central work and ignore the implementation of the Marriage Law. The study of district and township cadres should be regularly arranged and periodically checked, so as not to interrupt the phenomenon of disconnection.
3.  Party organizations, governments, and people's organizations, especially women's federations, at the district level should make the implementation of the Marriage Law in the district and the ideological style of cadres one of the contents of the work report of the district expanded cadre meeting; for the marriage problems that occur in the district, the district expanded cadre meeting must study and solve them under normal circumstances. District cadres should make assisting village cadres in implementing the Marriage Law one of their regular work.

    加强区乡干部对婚姻法的学习
    李正
    一年多以来，婚姻法在全国各地实行中获得了伟大的成就，广大群众在向封建婚姻制度斗争中赢得了伟大的胜利。这些成就和胜利的获得，有一个很重要的原因，就是各级党组织与政府的正确领导，特别是由于大多数区乡（村）干部正确宣传、执行了婚姻法。但是，在这伟大的胜利中，群众也曾付出了很大的代价，某些地方造成了过多的伤亡。譬如，中南区一年来因婚姻问题而被杀或被迫自杀的妇女竟达一万人。这是一个惊人的数字。其他地区被杀与自杀的事件也是很多的。这一方面是因为封建婚姻制度残余还在广大的农村中严重地存在着；另一方面，也是因为有不少区乡干部还存在着浓厚的封建意识与不良作风，直接间接地保护了封建婚姻制度的残余，阻碍了婚姻法的贯彻执行。
    区乡干部的封建意识主要表现在以下几点： “怕天下大乱”。婚姻法颁布后，东北的辽东、黑龙江，华北的平原、河北，华东的山东、浙江以及其他地区的不少区乡干部，较普遍地产生了不敢宣传婚姻法的现象。辽东有些村干部怕宣传婚姻法耽误了群众的生产。平原省有些村干部接到婚姻法以后就锁在抽屉里。浙江省更有个别村干部说：“谁要在我的村里宣传婚姻法，就打断他的腿！”由于干部不敢宣传，群众自然不能理解婚姻法的精神；而不法地主、某些不良分子，即乘机对新婚姻法进行恶毒的诬蔑、曲解和诽谤，说什么婚姻法是“离婚法”，“政府要发动离婚运动”等等。这一来，一部分群众就对婚姻法害怕起来。因而某些地方开会宣传婚姻法时，群众不让年轻妇女参加，因为“怕动员离婚”。处理离婚案件中的“大男子主义”思想。他们认为离婚会使男人吃亏，弄得男人“人财两空”。因之，他们对于要求离婚的妇女订出了种种限制条件，甚至公然进行无理的干涉。湖北省襄阳县刘家村吕芝春向丈夫提出离婚，她丈夫便勾结乡干部将她关起来，毒打一顿，并逼她承认以下四个条件：一、不准离婚，三年内不准住娘家；二、大小便要向公婆、丈夫请假报告；三、不准和娘家村里的任何人说话；四、出村要向妇女代表会报告。如果违反了这些苛刻的条件，罚“喝三碗大粪”。“大男子主义”思想也极无理地表现在处理妇女离婚带财产的问题上。不少区干部与县人民法院干部处理妇女带财产问题时，竟然主张“多带不如少带，少带不如不带”。山西榆次县好几个区人民政府竟擅自规定了带财产的原则是：“女的提出离婚者不带；男的提出离婚者可以带”。所以，有些妇女离婚后因生活无着而不得不又和原来的丈夫复婚，恢复了原来的痛苦生活。
    以旧的道德观念来处理离婚纠纷。他们认为离婚是“坏事”，“丢人”，“拆散家庭”。不少区干部调解离婚纠纷时，总是劝和不劝离。这样，调解便变成了对女方（目前提出离婚的多半是女方）的劝说。山东莒南县一对夫妻，双方自愿离婚，但区政府不批准。这对夫妻在从区政府回家的路上，找到一座土地庙，跪在“土地爷爷”面前离了婚。许多地方的妇女都说：“离婚过三关，过了村关过区关，过了区关过县关。村关最难过。”
    纵容与支持旧婚姻制度，对抗婚姻法。虽然这类人较少，但其危害却很大。这表现在包办婚姻、强迫出嫁、吊打妇女、暗地用钱买老婆、为别人说媒从中取利，或其他违法行为。山西兴县专区就有些区干部为人作媒包办婚姻。长治专区屯留县某村一个公安员因不够结婚年龄，怕政府批不准，便找人代替登记，直到“拜花堂”时才换成他本人。这一部分人是封建意识最浓厚的，他们给予群众的危害也最大。
    除了上述几种封建意识以外，在不少区乡干部中还存在着另外几种不正确的观点和作风。
    一种是狭隘的贫雇农观点。不少区乡干部为了“保护贫雇农利益”，凡是贫雇农的老婆提出离婚，不分青红皂白，一律不准。热河省朝阳县毛营子村一个贫农的老婆要与丈夫离婚，区长不批准，并把男女双方扣押了十多天，强迫发生肉体关系，然后才放回去。结果女方喝卤水自杀。张家口市一对夫妇，年龄悬殊，感情恶劣，女方提出离婚，区干部说：“不用离吧，看你丈夫是个工人，赚钱养活你，好不容易。”没有批准。不几天，女人失踪了，留给男方一个婴儿。这样，既害了女方，又害了男方。
    再一种是对群众的婚姻问题漠不关心，认为贯彻执行婚姻法是妇女的事。浙江省杭县某些区干部处理婚姻问题异常马虎，无论处理离婚案件或作结婚登记，都不超过半小时。有些地方对离婚采取了“有求必应”的态度。有些夫妇仅因一时口角，要求离婚，便被政府批准；结果不久又请求恢复夫妇关系。
    还有一种是严重的官僚主义与行政命令作风。山西某些区村干部对于群众的买卖婚姻，采用了没收财礼与扣押人的办法。陕西省靖边县某区自婚姻法颁布后到去年年底处理的八件婚姻纠纷中，就有四件是区长谢某与乡长罗某用捆绑办法解决的。有的地方在解决男女关系问题时，召开群众斗争大会，以致逼出人命。
    由于不少区乡（村）干部存有上述封建意识与不良作风，群众在反对封建婚姻制度的斗争中就不能得到有力的支持，就使许多地方残余的封建婚姻制度保存下来，就使新婚姻法在某些地区不能与群众见面。
    不少区乡干部之所以存有这种思想与作风的基本原因，是他们长时期受着封建思想的影响而又未受到严厉的批判。大多数区乡干部还是脱离家庭不久，或现在仍然是半脱离生产或不脱离生产的。他们的觉悟程度还不很高，“族权”、“夫权”的封建宗法思想还没有被清除。所以，在反对封建土地制度这个农民阶级与地主阶级的尖锐斗争中，他们勇往直前无所畏惧；然而，推翻旧的婚姻制度的斗争却是农民内部进步思想与落后思想的斗争，婚姻法一旦贯彻实行，男女之间的关系就要发生巨大的变化，旧的家庭关系也会逐渐改变，而封建的婚姻制度，旧的男女之间的关系，在他们已习以为常，因此，他们不愿接受，甚至抵抗婚姻法。这是一方面。另一方面，某些地区的领导机关对区、乡干部，尤其是乡（村）干部的思想教育，特别是关于婚姻法的教育十分不够。在婚姻法颁布以后，各地曾一度注意了对区乡干部进行婚姻法的教育工作，使大多数区乡干部初步地了解了婚姻法的精神；然而，这方面的经常的思想教育和政策指导是非常不够的。婚姻法颁布一周年的前后，中央各有关部门曾组织了婚姻法执行情况调查小组到山西进行调查。调查小组在山西走了几个地方，发现有这样两种情况：一是下边（区、乡）发生的问题多，上边（县以上）指导帮助少；一是民政部门在贯彻执行婚姻法中应做的工作最多，却对这一工作注意得最差。如山西榆次县第四区自婚姻法颁布后至今年三月，共办理结婚登记与处理离婚案件约四百件，其中除三十件婚姻案件送法院处理外，其余都是在区政府办理的。由于上述几种脱节情况，所以，有不少区乡干部的政策思想不能提高，他们曾无意地犯了许多错误。调查小组曾在榆次四区使张村简单地测验了十五个村干部，其中有九人不知道婚姻法是什么，包括民教委员与妇女代表会副主席在内；有六人模糊地知道婚姻法是“自由结婚，自由离婚，男的结婚年龄是二十岁，女的结婚年龄是十八岁”。从这里看，即使干部没有封建意识，婚姻法也很难良好地贯彻到群众中去。因此，加强区乡干部对婚姻法的学习是贯彻婚姻法的头等大事。
    如何做好这一工作呢？
    一、各地党组织应把关于婚姻法的教育作为农村支部党员思想教育的经常内容之一。在许多地区，村的主要干部中党员是占多数的。过去各地的经验已经证明：那里的党组织注意领导，那里的婚姻政策就执行得较好。山西昔阳县白羊峪村民主和睦的家庭已占全村户数的半数以上，基本上树立起新的婚姻制度，其主要原因就是由于党的支部能正确地领导以及大多数党员能够领会婚姻法的精神并以身作则的缘故。
    二、各级政府尤其是县人民政府应加强对区乡政权干部的政策指导，并帮助解决具体困难，提高干部思想水平与业务水平，以减少错误。县的领导干部只管当前的中心工作而忽略了贯彻执行婚姻法是不对的。对于区乡干部的学习应做经常的布置并进行定期检查，这样才不至于发生中断脱节现象。
    三、区一级党的组织、政府、人民团体尤其是妇女联合会，应将本区执行婚姻法的情况与干部的思想作风，做为区扩大干部会议工作报告的内容之一；对于本区发生的婚姻问题，区的扩大干部会议，在通常的情况下，一定要加以研究、解决。区干部应将协助村干部贯彻婚姻法做为自己经常工作之一。
