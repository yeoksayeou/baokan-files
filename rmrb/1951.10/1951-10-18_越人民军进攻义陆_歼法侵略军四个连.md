Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 15th: According to incomplete statistics, in the week of fighting that began on September 30th in the Nghĩa Lộ area of Yên Bái province, more than 150 kilometers northwest of Hanoi, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated a total of four companies of enemy troops and routed one battalion.

After the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated the French army strongholds of Ca Vịnh and Bản Xíu near Nghĩa Lộ, and drove back the French army from several other strongholds, they besieged Nghĩa Lộ, an important French stronghold. During this offensive, the French army commander of the Nghĩa Lộ sector was killed by the People's Army.

On October 6th, two battalions of French paratroopers (the 8th Colonial Parachute Battalion and the 2nd Foreign Legion Parachute Battalion) stationed in Giai Hoi, Yên Bái province, moved to Nghĩa Lộ to reinforce. The People's Army fiercely resisted, eliminating two companies of the enemy, routing one battalion, and capturing more than 100 paratroopers, including one lieutenant. In addition, one 75mm mortar, 33 machine guns, and 16 rifles were seized.
