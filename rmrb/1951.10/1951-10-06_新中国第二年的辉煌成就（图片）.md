	Ai Zhongxin

	Although rainfall this year was not as good as last year, the agricultural harvest was better than last year. Grain production increased by 8% compared to last year, reaching more than 92% of the 1936 level.

	Five million farmers and hundreds of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers participated in water conservancy construction. The first phase of the Huai River harnessing project, carried out according to Chairman Mao's instructions, has been completed, resulting in a bumper harvest in the Huai River basin.

	The area affected by disasters has been greatly reduced. The severely affected area was 120 million mu the year before last, 70 million mu last year, and only 40 million mu this year.

    今年雨水的状况不如去年，但农业收成比去年好。粮食产量比去年增加百分之八，达到一九三六年的水平的百分之九十二以上。
    五百万农民和几十万解放军参加了水利建设。根据毛主席指示进行的根治淮河工程第一期已经完成，使淮河流域得到了丰收。
    受灾面积已大大减少，重灾区前年是一亿二千万亩，去年是七千万亩，今年只有四千万亩。
