(Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd) TASS, October 21st, Tokyo dispatch: On October 16th, Japanese Communist Party Senator Ken'ichi Iwa presented an interpellation on the issue of the separate peace treaty at a meeting of the Japanese Senate. He said: The separate peace treaty signed in San Francisco has reduced Japan to a colony of US imperialism. He said: A treaty that stipulates the stationing of foreign troops in Japan cannot be called a peace treaty. A "peace treaty" concluded without the participation of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other Asian countries is illegal. It is a war preparation treaty that turns Japan into a military base for US imperialists to attack the people of Asian countries.

Iwa also said: Although the Japanese government claims that Japan has not provided any assistance to the US intervention troops in Korea other than "moral" aid, we already know that Japanese nationals are directly participating in the fighting on the Korean front on the US side, and that 85,000 Japanese are undergoing military training in Alaska. All of this shows that the Japanese government is deceiving the people and has in fact participated in the Korean War.

When Iwa mentioned the so-called "Security Treaty" between Japan and the United States, he said: The Japan-US Joint Committee established under the "treaty" is not responsible to the Japanese Diet in any way. This means that the Japanese government is merely an executive agency serving the Americans who hold all the power; that is to say, a colonial regime has been established in Japan.

Iwa further pointed out: The Japanese government's measures of increasing direct and indirect taxes on the people, increasing military spending, etc., are the consequences of concluding a separate peace treaty. At the same time, the Japanese government is stepping up the suppression of democratic forces, especially the Japanese Communist Party.

Iwa concluded: If the Japanese people cannot unite in the struggle against the group that sells out national interests, the Japanese people will fall into an unimaginable and tragic situation.

    日共参议员兼岩传一在参议院会议上提出质询
    严斥单独和约使日本降为美国殖民地
    并谴责吉田反动政府出卖民族利益参加侵朝战争 【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社二十一日讯：东京消息：十月十六日，日本共产党参议员兼岩传一在日本参议院会议上就单独和约问题提出质询。他说：在旧金山签订的单独和约，使日本降为美帝国主义的殖民地。他说：规定外国军队在日本驻扎的条约不能称为和约。没有苏联、中华人民共和国和亚洲其他国家参加而迳行缔结的“和约”，是非法的。这是一个把日本变为美帝国主义者进攻亚洲各国人民的军事基地的备战条约。
    兼岩又说：虽然日本政府扬言日本除了“道义”的援助以外并没有给在朝鲜的美国干涉军以任何援助，但是我们已经知道有日本籍的人正在美国一边直接参加朝鲜前线的战斗，并且知道有八万五千名日本人正在阿拉斯加受军事训练。这一切表明日本政府正在欺骗人民，在实际上已参加了朝鲜战争。
    兼岩提到所谓日美两国“安全条约”时说道：“条约”上规定成立的日美联合委员会，对日本国会不负任何责任。这意味着日本政府仅仅是一个为掌握一切大权的美国人服务的执行机构；这就是说在日本成立殖民地政权。
    兼岩进一步指出：日本政府采取增加人民的直接税和间接税、增加军费等等的措施，是缔结单独和约的后果。同时，日本政府正在加紧镇压民主力量，特别是日本共产党。
    兼岩结语说：如果日本人民不能在反对出卖民族利益的集团的斗争中团结起来，日本人民将陷入不堪设想的悲惨境地。
