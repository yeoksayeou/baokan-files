    Seriously Handle Feudal Foremen Exploiting Workers!
    Editor:
    The No. 1 and No. 2 Construction Brigades under the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company have very serious feudal foreman exploitation. For example, Li Guangwen, the head of the No. 2 Brigade, appointed Sun Zhaoqian (a feudal foreman) as the head of a work team, allowing him to use his position to exploit workers. After the construction site started in June this year, the brigade headquarters issued Sun Zhaoqian a total of 370 million yuan in wages for three months (June, July, and August), instructing him to distribute it to the workers. However, Sun Zhaoqian did not distribute all of it to the workers, nor did he settle the accounts. Taking the first group of the fourth team as an example, the workers should have received 7.97 million yuan in wages, but Sun Zhaoqian only distributed a little over 170,000 yuan. There are many such situations. Because the workers had no money, they had to obtain food and other necessities through Sun Zhaoqian, and he took advantage of this to resell flour, oil, etc., to the workers, thus exploiting them. By the time the construction site was about to be completed, the workers not only did not receive the wages they deserved, but instead owed Sun Zhaoqian money. Sun Zhaoqian also paid no attention to the safety of the workers. For example, once a worker was injured on the job, Sun actually said, "I am not responsible if he dies." In order to correct this error, the company has now decided to reorganize the two brigades and provide worker welfare. The company's administration and trade union have also made criticisms and self-criticisms, and are currently handling the cases of Li Guangwen, the head of the No. 2 Brigade, and the feudal foreman Sun Zhaoqian, etc., according to the demands of the workers.

### 严肃处理封建把头剥削工人事件！

    严肃处理封建把头剥削工人事件！编辑同志：
    山东省建筑工程公司所领导的第一建筑大队和第二建筑大队，封建把头剥削现象非常严重。比如第二大队长李广文任用中队长孙兆乾（系封建把头）掌握工地，使其利用职权剥削工人。今年六月工地开工后，大队部发给孙兆乾三个月（六、七、八月）工资共三亿七千多万元，让他发给工人，但孙兆乾并未全部发给工人，也未清算账目。以第四分队第一组来说，工人应得工资为七百九十七万元，孙兆乾只发给十七万余元。像这样情形是很多的。工人因为没有钱，所以吃的用的都要通过孙兆乾的手，于是孙又利用这点，将面、油等转卖给工人。进行剥削。工地将完工时，工人非但得不到应得的工资，反而欠了孙兆乾钱。孙兆乾对于工人的安全也是毫不注意的，如有一次某工人因公受伤，孙竟说：“死了我不负责任。”为了纠正这种错误，现该公司决定整理两个大队的组织和举办工人福利。公司行政和工会也作了批评与检讨，并正根据工人要求，分别处理第二大队长李广文和封建把头孙兆乾等。
