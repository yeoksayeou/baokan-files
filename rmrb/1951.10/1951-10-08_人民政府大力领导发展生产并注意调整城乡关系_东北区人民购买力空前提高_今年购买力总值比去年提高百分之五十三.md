Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of Northeast China have embarked on large-scale economic construction since the liberation of the entire Northeast. In less than three years, the entire economic landscape of Northeast China has been completely renewed, the purchasing power of urban and rural people has generally increased, and the economic life of the working people in the region has undergone unprecedented changes.

The Changes in the Economic Life of the People in Northeast China

The characteristic of the changes in the economic life of the people in Northeast China is first manifested in the unprecedented increase in people's purchasing power. This year, the total purchasing power of the people in the Northeast region is 53.5% higher than last year and 140% higher than the year before. Among them, the purchasing power of urban people is 38.7% higher than last year and 96% higher than the year before; the purchasing power of rural people is 67.9% higher than last year and 223% higher than the year before. The increase in purchasing power in various regions is as follows: the increase in purchasing power in economic crop areas is faster than in sideline product areas, sideline product areas are faster than general grain-producing areas, and commercial grain areas are faster than food grain areas.

Due to the rapid growth of purchasing power, the economic life of the people in the Northeast region has undergone tremendous changes. According to statistics from the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government, the total value of production materials and living materials supplied to the people by state-owned commercial enterprises in the first half of this year increased by 60.9% compared with the same period last year and 256.7% compared with the same period the year before. The sales volume of state-owned commercial enterprises in the regional market in the second quarter of this year increased by 15.2% compared with the first quarter.

This year, the people of Northeast China are demanding more varieties, larger quantities, and higher quality of goods, and the demand for cultural life and hygiene products has also increased rapidly. Taking cotton cloth as an example, among the cloths sold by the state-owned trading departments of Liaoxi Province in the first half of this year, fine cloth increased by 73% compared with the same period last year, and coarse cloth decreased to 2%; white cloth only increased by 11%, while colored cloth increased by 86%; the sales volume of printed cloth increased even faster, with only 10,000 bolts sold in the first half of last year, compared to 33,000 bolts in the same period this year. The people of Rehe Province, which has always been considered the "poorest" in Northeast China, purchased fine cloth for about 80% of the cloth bought by farmers this year after overcoming the disaster last year. In areas with faster production recovery, people demand higher quality of cloth. In department stores in LÃ¼da, Songjiang, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, fancy gabardine, good twill cloth, and poplin shirts have become fast-selling goods.

In terms of food, the sales volume of refined grains by the Dalian Municipal State-Owned Grain Company in the first half of this year exceeded 160% of the same period last year; the average sales volume of sugar and pastry shops, both public and private, in the city increased by more than two times compared with the same period last year; fishmongers' sales increased by 189% compared with last year; and butchers' sales increased by 140%. Thermos bottles, which farmers rarely used in the past, are now in short supply in the market.

In addition to the significant increase in demand for daily necessities, the people of Northeast China have also made rapid progress in their demand for means of production. The increase in the demand for means of production is most significant in economic crop areas. According to a survey of Jiangnan Village in Gaiping County, Liaodong, a cotton-producing area, the number of livestock in the village increased from 6 in 1948 to 15 in 1950, the number of carts increased from 15 to 25, the number of sprayers increased from 32 to 71, and the purchase of fertilizer increased from 53,000 jin in 1949 to 129,500 jin this year.

Reasons for the Increase in Purchasing Power of the People in Northeast China

The rapid increase in the purchasing power of urban and rural people in Northeast China is the result of the Northeast People's Government's implementation of the policy of developing production.

First of all, in order to restore and develop the national economy, the Northeast People's Government has vigorously carried out the construction of state-owned industries. The People's Government guaranteed huge investments and material supplies for state-owned and local industries. For example, taking the total investment of the Northeast People's Government in state-owned industries the year before last as the base number - 100, last year it was 164.84%, and this year it has increased to 289.8%. As a result, the total value of industrial production has increased year by year. The total value of industrial production in 1950 increased by 117.3% compared with 1949, and the total value of production this year will increase by more than 18% compared with last year. With the development of state-owned industries, local and private industries are also becoming increasingly prosperous. At present, the varieties of local industrial products have reached more than 200. The total value of industrial products purchased by state-owned trading departments from local industries this year increased by 75.4% compared with last year, and the total value of goods processed and manufactured by private industries for the state also increased by 165.4% compared with last year. At the same time, the number of employees in various enterprises has also increased year by year. This year, the total number of employees in state-owned and public enterprises increased by more than 41% compared with the year before last, and the total number of employees in private enterprises also increased by more than 38%. The ever-increasing industrial workers not only create more and more wealth for society, but also become important consumers of industrial and agricultural products. Due to the various measures taken by the People's Government to improve the lives of workers, the purchasing power of urban people has been directly increased. For example, in addition to enjoying various welfare benefits and bonus payments, the wage income of workers in state-owned factories and mines this year has increased by more than 1.5 times compared with 1948. Therefore, the current wage income of each heavy industry worker is approximately equal to the purchasing power of more than a dozen ordinary farmers. By implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and the policy of processing and ordering goods, and by providing support and encouragement to private industries in terms of credit and taxation, private industries have also achieved significant development.

The total value of private industrial production in 1950 increased by 107.8% compared with 1949, and in the first half of 1951, it increased by more than double compared with the same period last year.

Secondly, party and government leading organs at all levels have adopted a policy of actively leading and developing agricultural production, advocating improved farming techniques, rewarding the planting of industrial raw material crops and commercial grain crops, and correctly implementing the policy of rational burden, which has also increased the purchasing power of rural people. People's governments at all levels have vigorously led and organized farmers to participate in labor exchange and mutual assistance. According to statistics from Songjiang Province, in 1950, the number of households organized by farmers to participate in mutual aid groups accounted for 74% of the total number of households, the labor force participating in mutual aid groups accounted for 82.13% of the total labor force in the province, the number of draft animals participating in mutual aid groups accounted for 82.44% of all used draft animals, and the cultivated land area accounted for 82.81% of the total cultivated land area in the province. In order to encourage farmers to produce, the Northeast People's Government changed the public grain levy rate from 23% of the total output in 1948 to 20% of the standard output since 1949. The Northeast Branch of the People's Bank also issued a large number of agricultural loans. At the same time, the Northeast People's Government also reasonably adjusted the conversion ratio of various grains. All these measures have had a great effect on increasing agricultural commercial grain, special products, and improving the yield per hectare, creating brilliant achievements on the agricultural production front. The total grain output in

1950 reached 99.48% of the highest output in 1943. This year's plan to increase the yield per hectare by 6 to 7% will exceed the pre-war level. The same is true for sideline production. The grain converted from sideline production the year before last was about 2 million tons, last year it was more than 4 million tons, and this year the total value of local and special products is estimated to be converted into 7 million tons of grain. The soybean output last year increased by 1.5 times compared with the year before last, and this year it will increase by 20% compared with last year. The cotton output last year increased by 2.5 times compared with the year before last, and this year it will increase by 1.5 times compared with last year. Due to the rapid development of agricultural productivity, the purchasing power of people in general agricultural areas in Northeast China is now significantly higher than last year. Among them, the purchasing power of people in some areas of Liaoxi Province is more than 80% higher this year than last year, and the living standards of most farmers have reached the level of middle peasants.

Third, state-owned trading departments have extensively carried out the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign markets. First of all, state-owned trading departments solved the sales channels for agricultural and sideline products. Last year, the purchase of surplus grain increased by 78% compared with the year before last, and this year it increased by 46.7% compared with last year, which is equal to 2.61 times that of the year before last. Last year, the total value of local products purchased from farmers increased by 158.1% compared with the year before last, and this year it increased by 72.4% compared with last year, which is equal to 4.45 times the total value purchased the year before last. State-owned trade and cooperatives are closely combined, and private merchants are united, giving play to the initiative of various economic sectors, making the planning and organization of procurement and distribution more enhanced, thereby enlivening the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign markets, and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Fourth, correctly grasp the price policy, and ensure the continuous improvement of industrial and agricultural production and people's living standards. In recent years, prices in Northeast China have remained basically stable. In 1950, they increased by an average of 13.7% compared with 1949, and in the first half of 1951, they only increased by 3.9%. In terms of the price ratio of industrial and agricultural products, in 1949, one ton of sorghum could be exchanged for two bolts of coarse cloth, in 1950, it could be exchanged for 2.2 bolts of fine cloth, and in the first half of this year, it could be exchanged for 1.9 bolts of fine cloth. This price policy has played a positive role in stimulating the development of industrial and agricultural production and has further consolidated the worker-peasant alliance.
