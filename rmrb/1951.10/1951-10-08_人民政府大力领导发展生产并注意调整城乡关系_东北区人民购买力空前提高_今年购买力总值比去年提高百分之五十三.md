Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of Northeast China have embarked on large-scale economic construction since the liberation of the entire Northeast. In less than three years, the entire economic landscape of Northeast China has been completely renewed, the purchasing power of urban and rural people has generally increased, and the economic life of the working people in the region has undergone unprecedented changes.

The Changes in the Economic Life of the People in Northeast China

The characteristic of the changes in the economic life of the people in Northeast China is first manifested in the unprecedented increase in people's purchasing power. This year, the total purchasing power of the people in the Northeast region is 53.5% higher than last year and 140% higher than the year before. Among them, the purchasing power of urban people is 38.7% higher than last year and 96% higher than the year before; the purchasing power of rural people is 67.9% higher than last year and 223% higher than the year before. The increase in purchasing power in various regions is as follows: the increase in purchasing power in economic crop areas is faster than in sideline product areas, sideline product areas are faster than general grain-producing areas, and commercial grain areas are faster than food grain areas.

Due to the rapid growth of purchasing power, the economic life of the people in the Northeast region has undergone tremendous changes. According to statistics from the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government, the total value of production materials and living materials supplied to the people by state-owned commercial enterprises in the first half of this year increased by 60.9% compared with the same period last year and 256.7% compared with the same period the year before. The sales volume of state-owned commercial enterprises in the regional market in the second quarter of this year increased by 15.2% compared with the first quarter.

This year, the people of Northeast China are demanding more varieties, larger quantities, and higher quality of goods, and the demand for cultural life and hygiene products has also increased rapidly. Taking cotton cloth as an example, among the cloths sold by the state-owned trading departments of Liaoxi Province in the first half of this year, fine cloth increased by 73% compared with the same period last year, and coarse cloth decreased to 2%; white cloth only increased by 11%, while colored cloth increased by 86%; the sales volume of printed cloth increased even faster, with only 10,000 bolts sold in the first half of last year, compared to 33,000 bolts in the same period this year. The people of Rehe Province, which has always been considered the "poorest" in Northeast China, purchased fine cloth for about 80% of the cloth bought by farmers this year after overcoming the disaster last year. In areas with faster production recovery, people demand higher quality of cloth. In department stores in Lüda, Songjiang, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, fancy gabardine, good twill cloth, and poplin shirts have become fast-selling goods.

In terms of food, the sales volume of refined grains by the Dalian Municipal State-Owned Grain Company in the first half of this year exceeded 160% of the same period last year; the average sales volume of sugar and pastry shops, both public and private, in the city increased by more than two times compared with the same period last year; fishmongers' sales increased by 189% compared with last year; and butchers' sales increased by 140%. Thermos bottles, which farmers rarely used in the past, are now in short supply in the market.

In addition to the significant increase in demand for daily necessities, the people of Northeast China have also made rapid progress in their demand for means of production. The increase in the demand for means of production is most significant in economic crop areas. According to a survey of Jiangnan Village in Gaiping County, Liaodong, a cotton-producing area, the number of livestock in the village increased from 6 in 1948 to 15 in 1950, the number of carts increased from 15 to 25, the number of sprayers increased from 32 to 71, and the purchase of fertilizer increased from 53,000 jin in 1949 to 129,500 jin this year.

Reasons for the Increase in Purchasing Power of the People in Northeast China

The rapid increase in the purchasing power of urban and rural people in Northeast China is the result of the Northeast People's Government's implementation of the policy of developing production.

First of all, in order to restore and develop the national economy, the Northeast People's Government has vigorously carried out the construction of state-owned industries. The People's Government guaranteed huge investments and material supplies for state-owned and local industries. For example, taking the total investment of the Northeast People's Government in state-owned industries the year before last as the base number - 100, last year it was 164.84%, and this year it has increased to 289.8%. As a result, the total value of industrial production has increased year by year. The total value of industrial production in 1950 increased by 117.3% compared with 1949, and the total value of production this year will increase by more than 18% compared with last year. With the development of state-owned industries, local and private industries are also becoming increasingly prosperous. At present, the varieties of local industrial products have reached more than 200. The total value of industrial products purchased by state-owned trading departments from local industries this year increased by 75.4% compared with last year, and the total value of goods processed and manufactured by private industries for the state also increased by 165.4% compared with last year. At the same time, the number of employees in various enterprises has also increased year by year. This year, the total number of employees in state-owned and public enterprises increased by more than 41% compared with the year before last, and the total number of employees in private enterprises also increased by more than 38%. The ever-increasing industrial workers not only create more and more wealth for society, but also become important consumers of industrial and agricultural products. Due to the various measures taken by the People's Government to improve the lives of workers, the purchasing power of urban people has been directly increased. For example, in addition to enjoying various welfare benefits and bonus payments, the wage income of workers in state-owned factories and mines this year has increased by more than 1.5 times compared with 1948. Therefore, the current wage income of each heavy industry worker is approximately equal to the purchasing power of more than a dozen ordinary farmers. By implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and the policy of processing and ordering goods, and by providing support and encouragement to private industries in terms of credit and taxation, private industries have also achieved significant development.

The total value of private industrial production in 1950 increased by 107.8% compared with 1949, and in the first half of 1951, it increased by more than double compared with the same period last year.

Secondly, party and government leading organs at all levels have adopted a policy of actively leading and developing agricultural production, advocating improved farming techniques, rewarding the planting of industrial raw material crops and commercial grain crops, and correctly implementing the policy of rational burden, which has also increased the purchasing power of rural people. People's governments at all levels have vigorously led and organized farmers to participate in labor exchange and mutual assistance. According to statistics from Songjiang Province, in 1950, the number of households organized by farmers to participate in mutual aid groups accounted for 74% of the total number of households, the labor force participating in mutual aid groups accounted for 82.13% of the total labor force in the province, the number of draft animals participating in mutual aid groups accounted for 82.44% of all used draft animals, and the cultivated land area accounted for 82.81% of the total cultivated land area in the province. In order to encourage farmers to produce, the Northeast People's Government changed the public grain levy rate from 23% of the total output in 1948 to 20% of the standard output since 1949. The Northeast Branch of the People's Bank also issued a large number of agricultural loans. At the same time, the Northeast People's Government also reasonably adjusted the conversion ratio of various grains. All these measures have had a great effect on increasing agricultural commercial grain, special products, and improving the yield per hectare, creating brilliant achievements on the agricultural production front. The total grain output in

1950 reached 99.48% of the highest output in 1943. This year's plan to increase the yield per hectare by 6 to 7% will exceed the pre-war level. The same is true for sideline production. The grain converted from sideline production the year before last was about 2 million tons, last year it was more than 4 million tons, and this year the total value of local and special products is estimated to be converted into 7 million tons of grain. The soybean output last year increased by 1.5 times compared with the year before last, and this year it will increase by 20% compared with last year. The cotton output last year increased by 2.5 times compared with the year before last, and this year it will increase by 1.5 times compared with last year. Due to the rapid development of agricultural productivity, the purchasing power of people in general agricultural areas in Northeast China is now significantly higher than last year. Among them, the purchasing power of people in some areas of Liaoxi Province is more than 80% higher this year than last year, and the living standards of most farmers have reached the level of middle peasants.

Third, state-owned trading departments have extensively carried out the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign markets. First of all, state-owned trading departments solved the sales channels for agricultural and sideline products. Last year, the purchase of surplus grain increased by 78% compared with the year before last, and this year it increased by 46.7% compared with last year, which is equal to 2.61 times that of the year before last. Last year, the total value of local products purchased from farmers increased by 158.1% compared with the year before last, and this year it increased by 72.4% compared with last year, which is equal to 4.45 times the total value purchased the year before last. State-owned trade and cooperatives are closely combined, and private merchants are united, giving play to the initiative of various economic sectors, making the planning and organization of procurement and distribution more enhanced, thereby enlivening the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign markets, and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Fourth, correctly grasp the price policy, and ensure the continuous improvement of industrial and agricultural production and people's living standards. In recent years, prices in Northeast China have remained basically stable. In 1950, they increased by an average of 13.7% compared with 1949, and in the first half of 1951, they only increased by 3.9%. In terms of the price ratio of industrial and agricultural products, in 1949, one ton of sorghum could be exchanged for two bolts of coarse cloth, in 1950, it could be exchanged for 2.2 bolts of fine cloth, and in the first half of this year, it could be exchanged for 1.9 bolts of fine cloth. This price policy has played a positive role in stimulating the development of industrial and agricultural production and has further consolidated the worker-peasant alliance.

    人民政府大力领导发展生产并注意调整城乡关系
    东北区人民购买力空前提高
    今年购买力总值比去年提高百分之五十三
    东北人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，从全东北解放时起，就开始了大规模的经济建设。到现在不到三年，全东北的整个经济面貌已焕然一新，城乡人民的购买力普遍提高，全区劳动人民的经济生活已发生了空前未有的新变化。
    东北人民经济生活的变化
    东北人民经济生活变化的特点，首先表现在人民购买力的空前提高上。今年东北区人民购买力总值比去年提高百分之五十三点五，比前年提高百分之一百四十。其中城市人民购买力比去年提高百分之三十八点七，比前年提高百分之九十六；农村人民购买力比去年提高百分之六十七点九，比前年提高百分之二百二十三。各地区购买力提高的情况是：经济作物区购买力的提高快于副业产区，副业产区快于一般产粮区，商品粮食区快于食粮区。
    东北区人民由于购买力迅速增长，经济生活发生了巨大的变化。据东北人民政府贸易部统计，今年上半年国营商业供应人民生产资料和生活资料的总值，比去年同期增加百分之六十点九，比前年同期增加百分之二百五十六点七；今年第二季度国营商业在区内市场的卖钱额，比第一季度增加百分之十五点二。
    今年东北区人民对商品的要求，品种加多，数量增大，质量提高，文化生活与卫生用品的需求也迅速地提高了。以纱布为例，仅辽西省国营贸易部门今年上半年销售的布匹中，细布比去年同期增加百分之七十三，粗布减少到百分之二；白布只增加百分之十一，色布增加百分之八十六；花布销量增加更快，去年上半年只销一万匹，今年同期销了三万三千匹。在东北一向被认为是“最穷”的热河省人民，去年战胜了灾荒以后，今年农民购买的布匹中，细布占百分之八十左右。生产恢复较快的地区，人民对于布匹质量的要求就更高，如旅（顺）大（连）、松江、吉林、黑龙江各地百货商店中，花贡呢、好斜纹布和府绸衬衫等都成了快销货。
    在食用方面，今年上半年大连市国营粮食公司的细粮销售量超过去年同期的百分之一百六十；该市公私营糖果点心业，每户平均销货比去年同期增加了两倍以上；鱼商的卖钱额比去年增加百分之一百八十九；肉商的卖钱额增加了百分之一百四十。农民过去很少使用的暖水瓶，现在市场上也感供不应求。
    东北人民除对日常生活必需品的要求显著提高外，同时，对于生产资料的要求也是突飞猛进的。生产资料需要量的增多，尤以经济作物区为最显著。根据产棉区辽东盖平县江南村的调查，该村牲畜的增加，由一九四八年的六头增至一九五○年的十五头，大车由十五台增至二十五台，喷雾器由三十二台增至七十一台，购买肥田粉由一九四九年的五万三千斤增加到今年十二万九千五百斤。东北人民购买力提高的原因
    东北城乡人民购买力迅速增长，是东北人民政府贯彻了发展生产政策的结果。
    首先，东北人民政府为了恢复和发展国民经济，曾大力进行国营工业的建设工作。人民政府保证了对国营工业和地方工业的巨额投资和物资供应。如以东北人民政府前年对国营工业的投资总数为基数——一百，去年为百分之一百六十四点八四，今年更增加到二百八十九点八。工业生产总值因此逐年提高，一九五○年工业生产总值比一九四九年提高百分之一一七点三，今年生产总值将比去年增加百分之十八以上。随着国营工业的发展，地方工业和私营工业也日趋繁荣。目前，地方工业产物的品种已达二百多种。国营贸易部门今年向地方工业采购的工业品总值，比去年扩大百分之七十五点四，私营工业为国家加工制造的货物总值，也比去年扩大了百分之一百六十五点四。同时，各企业的职工人数也逐年增加。今年国营和公营企业的职工总数，比前年增加百分之四十一强，私营企业职工总数也增加百分之三十八强。不断增加着的工业劳动者不但给社会创造了日益增多的财富，而且他们也成为工农业产品的重要消费者。由于人民政府采取各种措施改善职工生活，直接增加了城市人民的购买力。如国营厂矿的职工，除享受各种福利及超额奖金外，今年工资收入就比一九四八年提高一倍半以上，因而，目前每个重工业工人的工资所得，约等于十多个普通农民的购买力。因执行劳资两利的政策及加工订货政策，并从信贷、税收等方面对私人工业扶植鼓励，目前私人工业亦获得显著发展。
    一九五○年私人工业生产总值比一九四九年增加百分之一○七点八，一九五一年上半年比去年同期增加了一倍多。
    其次，各级党政领导机关，采取了积极领导与发展农业生产的方针，提倡改进农作技术、奖励种植工业原料作物、商品粮食作物以及正确贯彻合理负担政策，也提高了农村人民的购买力。各级人民政府大力领导与组织农民，参加换工互助。据松江省统计，一九五○年组织农民参加互助组的户数占总户数的百分之七十四，参加互助组的劳动力占全省劳动力的百分之八十二点一三，参加互助组的耕畜占所有使用耕畜的百分之八十二点四四，耕地面积占全省耕地面积百分之八二点八一。为了鼓励农民生产，东北人民政府改变了公粮征收率，由一九四八年占总产量的百分之二十三降到一九四九年以来标准产量的百分之二十。人民银行东北区行还大量发放了农贷。同时东北人民政府又合理地调整了各种粮食折合比例。所有这些措施，对增加农业商品粮食、特产和提高单位面积产量，都收到很大效果，创造了农业生产战线上的辉煌成绩。粮食总产量，
    一九五○年已达一九四三年最高产量的百分之九九点四八。一九五一年每垧产量计划提高百分之六至七，将超过战前水平。副业生产亦复如此。前年副业生产折粮约二百万吨，去年折粮四百余万吨，今年估计土副特产总值可折粮七百万吨。去年大豆产量比前年增加一倍半，今年又将比去年增加百分之二十。去年棉花产量比前年增加两倍半，今年又将比去年增加一倍半。由于农业生产力的迅速发展，东北一般农产区人民购买力目前都比去年显著提高，其中辽西省有些地区人民的购买力，今年比去年提高百分之八十以上；多数农民的生活已经达到了中农的生活水平。
    第三、国营贸易部门，广泛开展了城乡、内外物资交流工作。首先各国营贸易部门解决了农副业产品的销路，去年采购余粮较前年增加百分之七十八，今年较去年增加百分之四十六点七，即等于前年的二点六一倍。去年采购农民土产总值较前年增加百分之一五八点一，今年比去年增加百分之七十二点四，等于前年采购总值的四点四五倍。国营贸易与合作社紧密结合，并团结了私商，发挥了各种经济的积极性，使采购与分配的计划性与组织性更加增强，从而活跃城乡与内外物资交流，促进了工农业生产的发展。
    第四、正确掌握物价政策，保证工农业生产与人民生活水平的不断提高。几年来，东北物价基本保持稳定，一九五○年较一九四九年平均上涨百分之十三点七，一九五一年上半年仅上涨百分之三点九。在工农业产品比价方面：一九四九年一吨高粱换粗布二匹，一九五○年换细布二点二匹，今年上半年换细布一点九匹。这一价格政策对于刺激工农业生产的发展，起了积极作用，并且进一步巩固了工农联盟。    （本报特约记者陈新）
