    To the Great Leader of the Chinese People, Chairman Mao Zedong, who sincerely aids the Korean people:
    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight, we extend our warm, militant gratitude and respect to you, all commanders and fighters of the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers, and the great Chinese people.
    On this day last year, the Korean people were facing the most difficult and serious period in their just struggle for national independence, freedom, and unification against the armed aggression of US imperialism. At that time, the fraternal Chinese people, under your leadership, under the banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland," organized the People's Volunteers to provide us with combat assistance, overcame the difficulties faced by the Korean people, and achieved brilliant victories in the struggle to defeat the US imperialist armed aggressors on our territory.
    In the past year, the heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the fierce and cruel combat environment, together with our People's Army, displayed unparalleled heroism, dedication, and perseverance, greatly inspiring the Korean people's confidence in victory. The noble internationalist spirit and moral character of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers are infinitely loved and respected by the entire Korean people. We, the Korean people, will never forget the blood shed and immortal achievements made by the Chinese People's Volunteers, under your leadership, in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea.
    Respected Chairman Mao Zedong! The great achievements and glorious victories won by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and our People's Army in a year of fighting side-by-side have become a solid foundation for our nation's independence, freedom, and the happiness and prosperity of future generations, and also make a great contribution to the historically significant great cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.
    In order to achieve the final victory in the Fatherland Liberation War as soon as possible, the Korean people are determined to further consolidate the long-standing friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, and will spare no effort to strengthen support for the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and our People's Army, regardless of any difficulties and hardships. Victory will surely belong to the Korean and Chinese people who are fighting for the independence, freedom, and honor of their motherlands and for the justice and happiness of mankind!
    For the democratic development and future prosperity of the Chinese people, and for lasting peace and security in Asia, we wish you a long life.
