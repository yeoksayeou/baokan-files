	Since the cotton bolls began to burst, the spacious courtyard of the Songtun Village Cooperative in Gaiping County, Liaodong Province, has been crowded with farmers selling cotton every day. The cotton sold by the farmers to the cooperative is all top-grade. One day, a woman carried a package of cotton. Upon opening it, it wasn't clean enough, so she sat on the ground and began to carefully pick through it. It turned out that because her husband had joined the Resist America, Aid Korea transportation team, she had to work in the fields during the day and could only pick cotton under the oil lamp at night, so she couldn't pick it very clean. People nearby, seeing how hard she was working, advised her to sell the cotton as second-grade. But she disagreed. She said, "It doesn't matter what grade the cotton is classified as, but if it's not picked clean, the workers at the factory will keep breaking the thread when spinning, won't that interfere with production?" She finally cleaned the cotton before handing it over to the cooperative.
	This is truly an unprecedented phenomenon. In the past, cotton farmers always kept the "first flush" of good cotton to sell for a better price, but this year the cotton farmers are voluntarily proposing to "pick quickly, dry quickly, and sell quickly to the state," enthusiastically launching a cotton-selling competition. Even the women who liked to save the best cotton the most have made a guarantee to dry and clean the cotton thoroughly, leaving no "small share."
	Years of practical life have made the farmers of Songtun Village deeply realize that individual interests and national interests are consistent. People clearly remember that when the People's Government called for planting more cotton last spring, most people had concerns, worrying that the purchase price would be low in the future. But the fact is that the People's Government stipulated the cotton-grain price ratio, which not only gave cotton farmers a good price, but also increased the supply of cloth needed by farmers due to the expansion of cotton planting area. In this poor mountain village, people used to have difficulty even wearing coarse white cloth clothes, but since planting more cotton, the cooperative's colorful printed cloth has quickly sold out. The facts have changed the old thinking of a few backward farmers. For example, Wang Deyuan, who was always conservative in his thinking, was beaten for growing cotton during the puppet Manchukuo period, but after liberation, he received assistance such as loans of grain and medicine from the People's Government for growing cotton. Therefore, he examined himself and said, "Two years ago, my head was full of individual wealth. The winter before last, in order to pay a few pounds less of public grass, I even mixed yellow mud into the grass, which was really letting the country down!" This time he also became an active member of the cotton selling movement.
	This year, almost all of Songtun Village's cotton fields were affected by aphids and spider mites in June and July. The government lent more than 2,000 catties of cotton medicine and more than 20 sprayers to quickly eliminate the serious insect plague. From this fact, the farmers further understood the significance of the worker-peasant alliance. Zhao Dexiu, the village head of Songtun Village, said it well: "This year, our cotton has had a bumper harvest, thanks to the sprayers and cotton medicine made by the workers. We should also dry and clean the cotton thoroughly so that the workers can weave good cloth!"

### 把棉花全部卖给国家

     把棉花全部卖给国家
      新华社记者  汪钦
    自从棉桃吐絮以来，辽东省盖平县松屯村合作社的宽敞的院子里天天拥挤着卖棉花的农民。农民们卖给合作社的棉花都是一色的头等花。有一天，一个妇女背来一包棉花，打开一看，不够干净，便坐在地上认真地挑选起来。原来她因为男人参加了抗美援朝运输队，白天自己要下地，只能在晚上油灯底下挑花，所以挑得不很干净。旁边的人看到她这样辛苦，劝她把棉花作为二等花卖掉。但是她不同意。她说：“棉花算作几等倒没有关系，只是挑不干净，把花送到工厂，工人们纺纱老断线，这不要误工吗？”她终于把棉花挑干净了才交给合作社。
    这真是从来没有过的现象。往年棉农们收获的“头喷”好花都是要收藏起来等卖好价钱的，可是今年棉农们却自动提出“快拣、快晒、快卖给国家”，热烈地展开了售棉竞赛。就连最喜欢保存好棉的妇女们，也提出了保证，要把棉花晒干、挑净，不留“小份子”。
    几年来的实际生活，使得松屯村农民深深地体验到个人利益和国家利益是一致的。人们都清楚地记得：去年春天人民政府号召多种棉花时，多数人还有顾虑，耽心将来收购的价格要低。但是事实却是：人民政府规定了棉粮比价，不仅使棉农得到好价钱，而且由于植棉面积扩大了，农民们所需要的布匹的供给量也增加了。在这个贫瘠的山村里，过去人们连粗白布衣裳也难穿上，自从多种棉花以来，合作社的五颜六色的花布，很快地就销售一空。事实改变了少数落后农民的旧脑筋。如思想一向保守的王德元，在伪满时因种棉花曾遭毒打，解放后种棉花却得到人民政府贷粮贷药等扶助。因此，他自己检讨说：“两年前，我还是满脑子个人发财，前年冬天为了少纳几斤公草，还往草里拌过黄泥，真是对不起国家！”这次他也变成了售棉运动中的积极分子。
    今年，松屯村的棉田在六、七月间几乎全部遭到蚜虫和红蜘蛛等虫害，政府贷给了两千多斤棉药和二十多个喷雾器，才把严重的虫灾迅速扑灭。农民们从这个事实中更进一步了解了工农联盟的意义。松屯村村长赵德修说得好：“今年咱们的棉花得到丰收，多亏工人造的喷雾器和棉药。咱们也应当把棉花晒干挑净，使工人能织出好布来！”
