Cultural Life Brief Comments

    Establishing Study Groups for Industrial and Commercial Business Owners
    Under the leadership and assistance of the District Consultative Committees and District Offices, industrial and commercial business owners in Beijing have established study group organizations in the spirit of self-reliance and self-study, to systematically study policies, laws, and current affairs.
    Since their establishment, these study groups have achieved the following results:
    (1) Helping industrial and commercial business owners understand policies and laws, and strengthening the connection between the government and industrial and commercial business owners. For example, after studying laws such as labor policy, the Trade Union Law, and the Provisional Regulations for Private Enterprises, industrial and commercial business owners have initially recognized the fundamental spirit of mutual benefit for labor and capital, and criticized the past mistaken views that mutual benefit for labor and capital meant equal division between labor and capital, and that public-private cooperation meant "all public and no private." Most industrial and commercial business owners participating in the study have become active in abiding by government laws and helping the government implement laws. They can not only solve the problems of their own enterprises according to law, reducing or avoiding the occurrence of labor-capital disputes, but also reflect some of the problems existing among industrial and commercial business owners at the study groups, so that the government can grasp the specific situation and deal with it in a timely manner.
    (2) Enhancing the patriotic enthusiasm of industrial and commercial business owners. Most study groups are able to conduct patriotic current affairs education in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Many industrial and commercial business owners have played an active role in promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and donating planes and cannons after studying.
    (3) Increasing the new political knowledge of industrial and commercial business owners. Some districts explained "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" at the study groups, and industrial and commercial business owners have gained some new knowledge about the Communist Party and the Chinese Revolution.
    (4) Strengthening the connection between industrial and commercial business owners, enabling them to exchange experiences and improve management.
    Establishing study groups for industrial and commercial business owners has many benefits. However, it should be noted that when establishing such organizations, it is necessary to proceed through the voluntary participation of industrial and commercial business owners, and to strengthen ideological leadership during the study process in order to achieve good results.

    Yangko Teams Should Pay Attention to Eliminating Morbid and Ugly Images
    Around National Day, some yangko teams presented some morbid and ugly images, giving the audience a bad impression. According to letters from readers Zhang Zengshou, Lao Mei, Zhao Xiuqin, and others: In the yangko team of the Zhengding Branch of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Shoe Factory in Zhengding County, Hebei, there appeared the image of corrupt Qing Dynasty officials; in Beijing, when a certain yangko team performed "Little Cart Meeting," a woman was sitting in the cart, with a pair of fake bound feet placed on the cart, and a young man dressed as a rogue made various frivolous and indecent gestures to tease the woman. In some yangko teams, there are men dressed as strangely shaped women, wearing two red peppers on their ears, exaggerating the painful markers of the old society's humiliation of women. This newspaper has published some critical articles on such low-taste and ugly portrayal of working people, such as Ma Shaobo's "Eliminate Morbid and Ugly Images on the Theatrical Stage" (published on September 27, third edition), and Li Qun's "Improve the Political and Ideological Nature of Spring Festival Entertainment Work" (published on January 26, third edition). It is hoped that yangko teams in various places will pay attention to and correct this undesirable phenomenon.

    文化生活简评
    建立工商业者学习会
    北京市工商业者在各区协商委员会和区公所的领导协助下，本着自办自学的精神，建立了学习会的组织，有计划地学习政策法令和时事。
    这些学习会自创办以来，已经取得以下的成绩：
    （一）帮助工商业者了解政策法令，加强了政府与工商业者的联系。如工商业者经过学习劳动政策、工会法、私营企业暂行条例等法令后，便初步认识到劳资两利的基本精神，批判了过去认为劳资两利是劳资平分、公私兼顾是“大（有）公无私”等错误看法。参加学习的工商业者，大部分都能成为遵守政府法令，帮助政府推行法令的积极分子。他们不仅能依法解决自己企业的问题，减少或避免了劳资争议的发生，而且还能在学习会上反映工商业者存在的一些问题，使政府能够掌握具体情况，及时处理。
    （二）提高了工商业者的爱国热情。多数学习会均能结合抗美援朝运动，进行爱国主义的时事教育，许多工商业者经学习后在宣传抗美援朝、捐献飞机大炮运动中起了积极的作用。
    （三）增加了工商业者新的政治知识。有的区在学习会上讲解“论人民民主专政”“中国革命与中国共产党”等，工商业者已经得到关于共产党和中国革命问题的一些新知识。
    （四）加强了工商业者之间的联系，使他们能够交流经验、改进经营。
    建立工商业者学习会，是有许多好处的。但应注意在开始建立这种组织时，必需通过工商业者的自愿，而在进行学习中又需要加强思想领导，才会收到良好的效果。秧歌队应注意清除病态和丑恶的形象
    国庆节前后，若干秧歌队出现了一些病态和丑恶的形象，给观众以恶劣的印象。据本报读者张增寿、老梅、赵秀琴等六人分别来信反映：在河北正定县石家庄专区制鞋厂正定分厂秧歌队里，出现了满清腐化官僚的形象；在北京，某秧歌队演出“小车会”时，车里面坐着一个女人，车上放了一双假的小脚，旁边有一个化装成流氓的年青人做出各种各样轻浮下流的调戏女人的动作。还有一些秧歌队里，有男人装成奇形怪状的女人，耳朵上戴两个红辣椒，把旧社会凌辱妇女的痛苦标记夸张地表现出来。像这种低级趣味和丑化劳动人民形象的现象，本报曾刊登过一些批评文章，如马少波的“清除戏曲舞台上的病态和丑恶形象”（载九月二十七日第三版），和力群的“提高春节文娱工作的政治性思想性”（载一月二十六日第三版）等。希望各地秧歌队注意并纠正这种不良现象。
