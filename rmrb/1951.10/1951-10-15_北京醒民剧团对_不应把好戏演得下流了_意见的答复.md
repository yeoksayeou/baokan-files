Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    To the Editors:
    We have seen the opinions of Comrades Wang Xueyi and Gao Zhengmin on our performance of "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Land" in the "Letters from Readers" section of the People's Daily on October 9th. In addition to expressing our heartfelt gratitude to the two comrades, we offer the following self-criticism: The male actor Zhang Chunting, who played in "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Land," is relatively backward in his political study. He cannot understand the feelings of the peasants and lacks a serious work style. Therefore, he distorted the original intention of the playwright during the performance. In addition to criticizing and educating Zhang Chunting, we have also educated all the actors in the troupe, and the leadership has also made a self-criticism. In the future, we will strengthen our study of political and literary policies, carefully examine the programs we perform, and serve the people faithfully.
                                          Beijing Xingmin Theater Troupe Liu Xingmin

### 北京醒民剧团对“不应把好戏演得下流了”意见的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京醒民剧团对“不应把好戏演得下流了”意见的答复编辑同志：
    我们看到了人民日报十月九日“读者来信”栏内王学义、高政民二同志对我们演出“兄妹开荒”的意见，除了对二同志谨致衷心的感谢外，并作如下的检讨：演“兄妹开荒”的男演员张春庭在政治学习上是比较落后的，他体会不了农民的情感，又缺乏严肃的作风，因此，在表演时歪曲了剧作者的原意。我们除了对张春庭提出批评进行教育外，并对全团演员也进行了教育，领导上也做了检讨。今后我们要加强政治和文艺政策的学习，认真检查我们演出的节目，忠诚地为人民服务。
                                          北京醒民剧团  刘醒民
