Beijing has made great achievements in providing preferential treatment. The city has successively organized more than 6,700 families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to participate in production. In order to support the production of families of martyrs and military personnel, the Municipal People's Government invested more than 970,000 jin of millet. The profits obtained in the first half of this year can maintain the livelihood of approximately 19,405 people for one month. The Municipal People's Government has also helped more than 2,500 families of martyrs and military personnel find employment. In order to facilitate the employment of families of martyrs and military personnel, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal People's Government has specifically opened technical training classes in accounting, sewing, and other skills. Currently, a total of more than 330 families of martyrs and military personnel are studying in these training classes, and it is planned to train more than 1,000 people this winter and next spring. The government provides long-term in-kind subsidies to families of martyrs and military personnel who are orphaned, elderly, disabled, or ill. The government provides appropriate care for families of martyrs and military personnel who are particularly in difficulty. In the suburbs, local governments vigorously carry out the movement of substitute farming. More than 6,000 mu of land belonging to more than 1,860 families of martyrs and military personnel who lack labor have been farmed on their behalf. In-kind subsidies are provided to families of martyrs and military personnel who have suffered crop failures due to disasters. Now, the livelihoods of families of martyrs and military personnel in the city are basically guaranteed. The problems of schooling and housing for children of families of martyrs and military personnel have also been resolved. This year, with the help of the Municipal People's Government, more than 2,000 children of families of martyrs and military personnel have entered middle and primary schools. In September, the Municipal People's Government allocated a total of 50,000 jin of millet to help more than 400 families of martyrs and military personnel repair their houses. Families of martyrs and military personnel can also receive appropriate care and treatment when they are sick. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市的优抚工作已做出很大成绩。全市先后组织革命烈士家属和军人家属六千七百多人参加了生产。为了扶植烈属和军属生产，市人民政府共投资九十七万多斤小米，今年上半年所获得的利润，约能维持一万九千四百零五人一个月的生活。市人民政府并帮助二千五百多烈属和军属找到了职业。为了使烈属、军属就业方便，市人民政府民政局特开办了会计、缝纫等技术训练班。现在在这些训练班学习的烈属和军属共三百三十多人，今冬及明春准备再训练一千多人。对于孤、老、残、病的烈属和军属，政府给以长期实物补助。对于特别困难的烈属和军属，政府更予以适当照顾。在郊区，当地政府大力开展代耕运动。一千八百六十多户缺乏劳动力的烈属和军属的六千多亩土地，都给人代耕了。对于因灾害歉收的烈属和军属，给予实物补助。现在全市烈属和军属的生活基本上已有了保障。烈属和军属子女入学和住屋问题也获得了解决。今年经市人民政府帮助进入中学和小学的烈属和军属的子女共二千多人。九月间，市人民政府共拨发五万斤小米帮助四百多户烈属和军属修建房屋。烈属和军属遇病时也能得到适当的照顾和治疗。（新华社）
