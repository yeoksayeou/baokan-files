    Egypt Decides to Abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty

    The Egyptian government decided on the 10th of this month to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan of 1899. This is an action by Egypt to demand independence and autonomy, and it is entirely just and reasonable. The Egyptian people have expressed widespread support and endorsement of this resolution.

    The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was an unequal treaty imposed on the Egyptian people fifteen years ago by British imperialism using its aggressive forces. According to this treaty, Britain could station troops in the Suez Canal Zone within Egypt; use the important Egyptian ports of Alexandria and Port Said as naval bases; and have the right to dispatch troops through Egyptian territory when necessary. The Egyptian people have consistently and resolutely opposed this imperialist treaty; although the British government has repeatedly feigned declarations to withdraw British troops, the number of British troops has in fact been increasing daily. Obviously, this is an act of aggression that violates Egypt's territorial sovereignty and uses armed forces to control Egypt.

    For decades, the Egyptian people have waged a resolute struggle against British imperialist aggression. The Egyptian House of Representatives' resolution to abolish this treaty is the result of the continuous upsurge of the Egyptian people's struggle movement. Egypt's decision to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty is a significant blow to Britain's economic interests and to the Anglo-American imperialists' dominance and war preparations in the Near East. The alarmed cries of Attlee, Morrison, and Acheson are sufficient to illustrate this fact.

    The actions of the Egyptian people against British imperialism have received the sympathy of all righteous people around the world. The Chinese people deeply understand the plight of the Egyptian people and fully sympathize with the Egyptian people's struggle for independence and freedom. At a time when such mass revolutionary movements are surging, the Egyptian people should also be vigilant, prevent the sabotage of imperialist elements, and strengthen the unity of the people in order to strive for final victory.

### 埃及决定废除英埃条约

    埃及决定废除英埃条约
    埃及政府已于本月十日决定废除一九三六年英埃条约和一八九九年英埃共管苏丹的协定。这是埃及要求独立自主的行动，是完全正当合理的。埃及人民对这一决议，已表示普遍的支持与拥护。
    英埃条约是英帝国主义利用其侵略势力在十五年前强加于埃及人民的一个不平等条约。根据这一条约，英国可以在埃及境内苏彝士运河区驻扎军队；把埃及的重要港口亚力山大港与塞得港作为海军基地；并有权在必要时调遣军队通过埃及境内。埃及人民一贯坚决地反对这个帝国主义的条约；英国政府虽曾一再装腔作势地宣称要撤退英国驻军，而事实上英国驻军的人数却在日益增加。很显然，这完全是一种侵犯埃及领土主权，武装控制埃及的侵略行为。
    数十年来，埃及人民为反对英帝国主义的侵略而进行了坚决的斗争。埃及众议院此次通过废除这一条约的决议，就是埃及人民斗争运动不断高涨的结果。埃及废除英埃条约的决定，对于英国的经济利益与美英帝国主义在近东的统治地位与备战计划，是一个很重大的打击。艾德礼、莫里逊与艾奇逊之流对此所表现的惊惶叫嚣，就足以说明这一事实了。
    埃及人民反对英帝国主义的行动，受到全世界正义人士的同情。中国人民深切了解埃及人民的遭遇，完全同情埃及人民争取独立自由的斗争。在这样群众革命运动高涨的时候，埃及人民还应当提高警惕，防止帝国主义分子的破坏，加强人民的团结，以争取最后的胜利。
