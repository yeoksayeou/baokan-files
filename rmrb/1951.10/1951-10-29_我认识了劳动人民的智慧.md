I Recognized the Wisdom of the Working People
Guo Fang, Soil and Water Conservation Work Team, Engineering Department, Henan Province Huai River General Command

This spring, I participated in soil and water conservation work in the upper reaches of the Huai River. When I crossed many barren mountains and ridges, and passed through one sandy river and deep gully after another, I almost couldn't believe it was spring. There were no green forests on the mountains, and the river valleys were full of withered grass and white sand. The forests of the past had become barren ridges, and the fertile fields had become beaches. Why was the soil erosion so severe? Local farmers told me that the heavy taxes and forced labor during the Kuomintang reactionary rule forced them to reclaim wasteland in the mountainous forest areas. At the same time, in addition to extorting firewood and grain, forcibly conscripting young men, and abusing civilian labor, the reactionary army also arbitrarily felled trees on the mountains, resulting in the destruction of the soil in the mountainous areas year after year. For example, in the mountainous areas upstream of the Banqiao Reservoir in Biyang County, Henan Province, there were still many trees during the Anti-Japanese War, but now not a single tree remains, and the rocks on the slopes are exposed. In some places in Yiyang County, the trees were towering more than fifty years ago, but now nothing grows, and the local people have to seek a living fifty miles away. This shows that the reactionary rulers' unlimited exploitation and oppression of the people, and their arbitrary destruction of trees, not only made it impossible for the people in the mountainous areas to survive, but more seriously damaged the soil in the mountainous areas, thereby raising the riverbeds downstream and creating the root cause of floods.

Soil and water conservation work is part of the "thorough control of the Huai River" project. During my participation in soil and water conservation work, I deeply realized that book knowledge must be combined with the experience of the working people. Despite the Kuomintang reactionary rulers' arbitrary devastation, oppression and exploitation of the people in the mountainous areas, they did not diminish the working people's strong will to fight against nature. For many years, they have built check dams in the gullies, transformed slopes into terraces, and opened dry canals in the mountains, and have created many valuable experiences. These experiences have given me great inspiration. Many of the masses' experiences surpassed the knowledge I learned in books. For example, in order to slow down the water flow, mountain farmers plant willow trees or build check dams in the gullies; in order to consolidate the check dams, they plant thatch and small trees on the upper and lower slopes of the check dams, and some even leave a spillway on the side; when a lot of sediment has accumulated in the check dams, they plant reeds, and after the reeds have grown for several years, they cultivate the soil again. In this way, barren gullies are transformed into fertile fields. There are many similar examples.

During the construction of soil and water conservation projects, I initially believed that relying on the masses was simply to tell the migrant workers the technical requirements, and at the same time strengthen technical guidance and inspection to ensure that the project met the standards. Facts have proved that this understanding of mine was wrong. In the actual work process, some migrant worker teams worked very hard, the projects were done up to the requirements, and the work efficiency was relatively high. However, some migrant worker teams emphasized difficulties, did not work with peace of mind, and the projects were not up to the standards. This made me deeply realize that I had not solved the problem of "relying on the masses." Mobilizing the masses and organizing the masses is not just a matter of telling the masses about the technology, but also of believing in the strength of the masses, going deep into the masses, patiently helping the masses solve various ideological problems, and humbly learning from the masses, enlightening the masses' awareness, and turning the guarantee of project standards into the masses' own business, so as to avoid deviations and errors in the work. Therefore, I realized that close contact with the masses during construction is the main key to ensuring project standards and improving work efficiency.

This spring's construction has made me more deeply appreciate Chairman Mao's famous saying of "from the masses, to the masses," but I feel that I have learned too little, and I must study harder in the future to become a technical worker needed by the people.

    我认识了劳动人民的智慧
    河南省治淮总指挥部  工程部水土保持工作队  郭钫
    今年春天，我参加淮河上游的水土保持工作。当我翻过许多荒山秃岭，穿过一条条的沙河深沟时，几乎不相信是在春天。山上没有青丛茂林，河沟尽是枯草白沙，昔日的山林变成了荒岭，肥沃的田地变成了沙滩。为什么土壤冲刷到这样地步呢？当地农民告诉我：国民党反动统治时期的苛捐杂税、拉丁逼款，使他们不得不往山林区垦荒。同时，反动军队除了勒索柴粮，强拉壮丁和滥用民力外，还要上山任意砍伐林木，结果山区土壤就一年一年被破坏了。像河南省泌阳县板桥水库上游一带的山区，在抗日时期还有很多树林，但至今已棵木不存，山坡的岩石都裸露在外面。伊阳县有些地方在五十多年前还是林木参天，现在已经寸草不生，当地群众已不得不到五十里以外去另谋生活。这说明反动统治者无限制的剥削压榨人民，任意破坏林木，不仅使山区人民活不下去，更严重地是破坏了山区的土壤，从而淤高了下游的河床，造成水灾的根源。
    水土保持工作是“根治淮河”工程的一部分。在我参加做水土保持工作的过程中，我深刻体会到书本知识必须和劳动人民的经验相结合。尽管国民党反动统治者任意摧残和压榨剥削山区人民，但并未减低劳动人民向自然作斗争的坚强意志。多少年来，他们在山沟里建筑谷坊，把山坡改造成梯田，在山地开旱渠，已创造了许多宝贵经验。这些经验给了我很大的启发。群众许多经验超过了我在书本上所学到的知识。比如山区农民为使水流减缓，就在山沟里种柳树或建筑谷坊；为使谷坊巩固，就在谷坊上下坡栽茅草和小树，有的还在侧面留一个泄水道；当谷坊内淤积很多泥沙的时候，他们就种上苇草，待苇草长过数年之后，再实行翻耕。这样就使贫瘠的山沟变成了肥沃的良田。类似这样的例子很多。
    在水土保持工作的施工过程中，最初我认为依靠群众仅仅是把技术要求告诉给民工，同时对他们加强技术指导和检查，这样就可以保证工程适合标准。事实证明，我这种认识是错误的。在实际工作过程中，有的民工队工作很起劲，工程做得合乎要求，工作效率也比较高。可是有的民工队却强调困难，工作不安心，工程做得也不合标准。这使我深刻认识到，我并没有解决“依靠群众”这个问题。发动群众与组织群众，不仅仅是把技术告给群众就算完事，而是要相信群众的力量，深入到群众中去，耐心地帮助群众解决各种思想问题，并虚心向群众学习，启发群众的觉悟，把保证工程标准变成群众自己的事，这样就可以避免工作中的偏差和错误。因此使我认识到，在施工中密切联系群众是保证工程标准，提高工作效率的主要关键。
    今春的施工，使我更深刻地体会了毛主席从“群众中来，到群众中去”的名言，但是我感觉到自己学习的还太少，今后必须更加努力学习，使自己成为人民需要的一个技术工作者。
