Since the Chinese People's Volunteers went abroad to fight, for the past year, mass movements to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen have been enthusiastically launched in all cities and villages across the country. Supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen has become a conscious action of the people and a social custom. Preferential treatment work is no longer carried out solely by the preferential treatment work departments. Many provincial agencies and people's organizations have formulated preferential treatment work plans based on their own work situations and mobilized various social forces to do preferential treatment work. The broad masses of the people have generally incorporated preferential treatment work into patriotic pledges. For example, in Tangshan and Dingxian counties in Hebei Province, more than 80% of the villages have incorporated preferential treatment work into patriotic pledges. In Xuchang City, Henan Province, 64 out of 74 industries have organized preferential treatment work groups and formulated long-term preferential treatment work plans. Some areas have also specifically formulated covenants on "doing a good job in substitute farming and giving preferential treatment to military families." The organization and inspection system for preferential treatment work has become increasingly sound in most parts of the country. For example, 31 districts in Shanghai have established preferential treatment work committees, and preferential treatment work groups have been established in more than 330 neighborhoods. In the vast rural areas of Shanxi and Chahar provinces, the district and village preferential treatment work committees have organized inspection committees. Some areas have stipulated a monthly inspection system, and some villages have organized mutual observation and inspection on a seasonal basis.

The broad rural areas have generally adopted substitute farming methods such as the contract farming system and the work point system. In areas where labor is scarce and the people's burden is too heavy, a system of unified labor allocation for substitute farming is implemented. Local people's governments and the broad masses of the people have also helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen solve difficulties such as the lack of seeds and agricultural tools, thus ensuring that the land cultivation of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen is timely and yields are increased. According to a survey conducted by the Anguo County People's Government in Hebei Province in eight villages, the 113.3 acres of wheat fields of 48 households of martyr's families, military families, and worker's families who received substitute farming yielded an average of 127 catties of wheat per mu, which was 13 catties more per mu compared to the average yield of wheat fields of 48 households of farmers with equal soil quality. In Yaoshanggou Village, Shanxi Province, the average yield per mu of land cultivated by substitutes in 1948 was 9.83 dou, which reached 1.23 shi in 1949 and increased to 1.38 shi in 1950. Last year, one-third of the martyr's families and military families in the village had a land yield per mu that exceeded the village's average yield by more than 3 dou, and one-third of the martyr's families and military families had more than 10 shi of surplus grain. The martyr's families and military families in the whole village are living a prosperous life. The military families have written letters to their loved ones saying:

"Our land is cultivated first and planted ahead of time. We hope you can concentrate on killing the enemy at the front!"

In the cities, thanks to the correct implementation of the preferential treatment work policy of "introducing employment and organizing the production of martyr's families and military families combined with material subsidies," the lives of martyr's families and military families have been basically guaranteed and improved. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government introduced employment to 2,217 martyr's families, military families, and worker's families in one year. The revolutionary disabled veterans and demobilized soldiers in the city, except for a few who are old and sick, have all found jobs. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government has also allocated 800,000 catties of millet to establish 22 production organizations, enabling 532 martyr's families, military families, and worker's families to participate in production. In order to make it easier for martyr's families and military families to find employment, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has specially organized them to participate in cultural and technical training classes.

Local people's governments have provided material subsidies to martyr's families and military families who have extremely difficult lives. In Chahar Province, 33,754 households of martyr's families, military families, and worker's families (with a population of 124,889) have received subsidies. Local people's governments actively help the children of martyr's families and military families to enroll in schools. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government has introduced 4,076 children of martyr's families and military families to enroll in schools, of which 1,055 enjoy free treatment. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has specially established five schools for the children of martyrs and servicemen. Currently, there are more than 1,900 students in these five schools.

The political status of martyr's families and military families has also been greatly improved. They have representatives participating in the local people's representative conferences. Many of the martyr's families and military families have participated in government work or become labor models. They have the right to enjoy priority in all local welfare undertakings. During the New Year and festivals, the people organize condolence groups to give gifts and greetings to the martyr's families and military families.

Over the past year, especially after the China People's 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) General Association issued three major appeals on June 1st, the movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen has reached a climax throughout the country. Subsequently, according to the notice of the China People's 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) General Association, a thorough inspection of preferential treatment work was carried out around the "August 1st" Army Day. At present, various localities are continuing to conduct preferential treatment work education among cadres and the broad masses of the people, so as to further enhance everyone's ideological understanding and regularize preferential treatment work.

    拥军优属已经成为全国人民自觉的行动
    自中国人民志愿军出国作战的一年以来，全国所有的城市和乡村都热烈开展着群众性的拥军优属运动。拥军优属已成为全国人民自觉的行动和社会的风尚。优抚工作已不仅由优抚工作部门单独进行，很多省的各机关、各人民团体，都根据本部门工作情况，订出优抚工作计划，并发动各种社会力量来做优抚工作。广大人民普遍将优抚工作订入爱国公约。如河北省唐山、定县两个专区的百分之八十以上的村庄，都把优抚工作订入爱国公约。河南省许昌市七十四个行业中有六十四个行业组织了优抚小组，制定了长期的优抚工作计划。有些地区还专门订立“作好代耕与优待军属”的公约。全国大部分地区优抚工作的组织和检查制度已日益健全。如上海市三十一个区已建立了优抚工作委员会，在三百三十多条里弄中成立了优抚工作小组。山西、察哈尔两省广大农村的区、村优抚工作委员会都组织了检查委员会。有些地区的区、村规定了每月一次的按期检查制度，有些村并按季节组织相互观摩和检查。
    广大农村普遍采用了包耕制、工票制等代耕办法。在劳动力缺乏、人民负担过重的地区，实行劳力统筹的代耕办法。各地人民政府和广大人民还帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属们解决缺乏种籽、农具等困难，因而保证了革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的土地耕种及时，产量增加。据河北省安国县人民政府在八个村的调查，四十八户受代耕的烈属、军属、工属的一百一十三亩三分麦田，平均每亩产麦一百二十七斤，与土质相等的四十八户农民的麦田平均产量相比，每亩多产十三斤。山西省窑上沟村一九四八年代耕土地每亩平均产量九点八三斗，一九四九年达到一点二三石，一九五○年增到一点三八石。该地去年全村有三分之一户烈属、军属的土地产量每亩超过全村平均产量三斗以上，三分之一户烈属、军属有余粮十石以上。全村烈属、军属都过着富裕的生活。军属们纷纷写信给亲人说：
    “咱们的地耕在先，种在前，希望你们安心在前方杀敌吧！”
    在城市里，由于正确执行了“介绍职业与组织烈属、军属生产为主结合实物补助”的优抚工作方针，烈属、军属的生活基本已获得保障和改善。天津市人民政府一年中给二千二百一十七名烈属、军属、工属介绍了职业。该市的革命残废军人、复员军人除少数年老和有病的外，已全部有了工作。天津市人民政府并拨出八十万斤小米，建立了二十二个生产组织，使五百三十二名烈属、军属、工属参加了生产。北京市人民政府为使烈属、军属就业方便，特组织他们参加文化和技术训练班学习。
    对生活极为困难的烈属、军属，各地人民政府都给予实物补助。察哈尔省烈属、军属、工属受补助的有三万三千七百五十四户（人口十二万四千八百八十九人）。各地人民政府积极帮助烈属、军属的子弟入学。天津市人民政府已介绍四千零七十六名烈属、军属的子弟入学，其中有一千零五十五人享受免费待遇。江西省人民政府特举办了五所烈士和军人子弟学校，现在该五校内已有一千九百余名学生。
    各地烈属、军属的政治地位也大大提高。各地人民代表会议都有他们的代表参加。烈属、军属们中间有很多人已参加了政府工作，或当了劳动模范。当地的一切福利事业，他们都有优先享受的权利。过年过节时，人民纷纷组织慰问队，向烈属、军属赠送礼品和慰问祝贺。
    一年来，特别是中国人民抗美援朝总会在六月一日发出三大号召后，全国各地的拥军优属更走向高潮。接着，各地又根据中国人民抗美援朝总会的通知，在“八一”建军节前后，对优抚工作做一次切实的检查。目前，各地正在干部和广大群众中，继续进行优抚工作教育，使大家在思想认识上提高一步，把优抚工作经常化起来。（新华社）
