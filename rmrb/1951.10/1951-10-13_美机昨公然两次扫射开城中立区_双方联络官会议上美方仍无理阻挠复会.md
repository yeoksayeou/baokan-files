    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th. Our special correspondent reports: Just as the U.S. side is deliberately delaying and obstructing the resumption of negotiations, U.S. military aircraft brazenly strafed the Kaesong neutral zone twice in broad daylight, causing deaths and injuries. At around 17:35 today, three U.S. military aircraft flew in from the southwest, first diving and strafing once within the Kaesong northwest neutral zone, and then flying low over Kaesong and diving and strafing once on the highway near Panmunjom, the site of the new negotiation meeting. Two local children were hit, one dying on the spot and one injured. Observers here believe that this serious provocative incident once again manufactured by the U.S. side raises a question in people's minds: People want to ask: Does the U.S. side still have the slightest sincerity in preparing to resume armistice negotiations?
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th. The liaison officers' meeting between the two sides continued at Panmunjom at 10:00 a.m. on October 12th. During the discussion before the adjournment at 11:30 a.m., our liaison officer submitted in writing the temporary agreement reached by the liaison officers of both sides on the resumption of the delegation meeting from October 10th to October 11th, summarized the discussions of the past two days, and pointed out that the liaison officers of both sides had reached a full agreement on the resumption of the delegation meeting. He formally suggested that the issues raised by the other side regarding the formal definition of the scope of the neutral zone be submitted to the first delegation meeting after the resumption of the meeting, and that discussions on the specific date and time of the resumption of the meeting should begin immediately. However, at the meeting that started at 2:30 p.m., although the other side's liaison officer agreed that the two sides had reached a full temporary agreement on the resumption of the meeting, he still demanded discussion on the specific scope of the neutral zone and refused to discuss the date and time of the resumption of the negotiation meeting, so that the delegations of the two sides still could not resume the meeting quickly. The afternoon meeting ended at 3:57 p.m., and the two sides agreed to continue the meeting at 10:00 a.m. on October 13th.

    美机昨公然两次扫射开城中立区
    双方联络官会议上美方仍无理阻挠复会
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者报道：正当美方蓄意拖延和阻挠谈判恢复的时候，美国军用飞机竟公然在白昼两次扫射开城中立区，并造成死伤。今日十七时三十五分左右美国军用飞机三架，自西南飞来，首先在开城西北中立区内俯冲扫射一次，接着又从开城上空低飞掠过谈判会议新会场板门店附近公路上俯冲扫射一次，当地居民二小孩中弹，当场一死一伤。此间观察家认为：美方又一次制造这一严重挑衅事件，在人们心中引起了一个疑问，人们要问：美方是否还有丝毫诚意准备恢复停战谈判。
    【新华社开城十二日电】双方联络官会议在十月十二日上午十时在板门店继续举行，我方联络官在十一时三十分休会前的讨论中，书面提出双方联络官在十月十日至十月十一日联络官会议上为双方代表团复会事宜所达成的临时协议，总结了两日来的讨论，并指出双方联络官对于代表团复会事宜已达成充分的协议，正式建议将对方提出的关于正式规定中立区范围等问题，提交复会后的第一次代表会上讨论，要立即进入具体复会日期与时间的讨论。但是在下午二时三十分开始的会上，对方联络官虽然同意双方在复会事宜上已达成充分的临时协议，却仍然要求讨论中立区具体范围等问题，拒绝讨论恢复谈判会议的日期与时间问题，以致双方代表团仍不能迅速复会。下午的会议在三时五十七分结束，双方约定在十月十三日上午十时继续开会。
