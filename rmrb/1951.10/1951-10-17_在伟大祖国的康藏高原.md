    On the Kangzang Plateau of the Great Motherland

    People who have never been to the Kangzang Plateau always think that it is a desolate place; but when they arrive, they see a magnificent world.
    After we arrived in Ya'an, Xikang Province, we followed the Kangzang Highway newly opened by the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, and crossed the Erlang Mountain and Zheduo Mountain, which are three to four thousand meters above sea level. In the high mountains and deep valleys, the car can only crawl six or seven kilometers per hour. On one side is a towering cliff, and on the other side is a rushing river. As we advance on this dangerous road, we cannot help but think of the heroes who pioneered this road—the troops entering Tibet who built roads through mountains, built bridges over rivers, endured all kinds of hardships, and overcame difficulties in order to build the border areas of the motherland.
    After crossing Zheduo Mountain, we were pleasantly surprised by the rich scenery of the plateau. Here are rolling hills of all sizes, and vast green grasslands. Layers of snow-capped mountains radiate golden light in the sky. Among the forests on the mountainside, magnificent Lama temples can often be seen. In the plains at the foot of the mountains, patches of golden highland barley fields and colorful pea flowers bloom all over the wilderness. On the pastures, large groups of yaks and sheep can be seen everywhere. Flowers and grasses surround the herders' tents, and the Tibetan men and women who are grazing freely sing mountain songs. They welcome us and give us a thumbs up on the roadside and cheer to us: "Representatives of Chairman Mao!" "Ya Mo Ya Suan!"
    (Meaning very good)
    We went deep into Daofu and Ganzi on the Kangzang Plateau via Tianquan, Luding, and Kangding. Near Daofu, the highland barley and wheat that grow taller than people are everywhere. The People's Liberation Army entering Tibet has reclaimed many fertile lands in the Ganzi area. Near their驻地, there is almost a small vegetable garden full of radishes and Chinese cabbages. A soldier told us that they had harvested more than 3,000 kilograms of potatoes from one acre of land.
    The abundance of local and special products and underground treasures on the Kangzang Plateau is even more exciting. At the local product exhibition in Kangding, we saw precious bear bile, bear paws, deer antlers, musk, Tibetan saffron, Tibetan safflower, cordyceps, tiger skins, leopard skins, and the fur of many rare wild animals. On the way, we saw many shiny open-pit coal seams. The Luhuo and Dege areas are rich in copper and iron. Valuable oil is buried near Qamdo. In a quiet mountain, there is a river ditch with a thick layer of mineral oil floating on the water, which the Tibetans use for lighting lamps. Dengke in northern Tibet is rich in mica, and Tibetans use mica sheets to paste windows. The plateau produces more gold. A Tibetan in Luhuo County once mined more than seventy taels of gold in three days.
    This rich land has just returned to the embrace of the people. The love of the Tibetan, Yi, and Han people for the people's motherland and the Chinese and Korean People's Army, and the hatred for the US imperialism that is plotting to enslave the Chinese people again, are understandable. In Kangzang, we made 65 reports to people of all ethnic groups and local garrison troops, and performed various cultural programs 36 times. More than 70,000 people who came into contact with us, including local Tusi, headmen, and living Buddhas and monks from Lama temples, met with us with fanatical feelings. They said: "Chairman Mao is the real Living Buddha, you are the representatives of Chairman Mao, please sit in the position of the Living Buddha." Many Tibetans brought butter tea, tsampa, and tents, and rode horses from dozens of miles away to listen to the reports. The heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army on the Korean front touched the hearts of people of all ethnic groups. Patriotic covenants were posted at the gates of Lama temples. Residents of Luhuo County organized themselves to help the families of Red Army soldiers and newly established Tibetan soldiers from the Long March era cultivate the land. Ganzi County, an area with a population of more than 20,000, donated 150 million yuan to the Volunteer Army to buy airplanes and artillery. An old Tibetan woman in her sixties in the Muya area of Kangding said: "I am wearing a new pair of shoes for the first time in more than ten years. I donate a pound of butter tea to thank the Volunteer Army."
    At the same time, we also visited the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet on the Kangzang Plateau. Our People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, like the Volunteer Army on the Korean front, are working hard to defend the motherland and build the border areas of the motherland with the same lofty patriotism and optimism. Our heroic People's Liberation Army entering Tibet misses our Chairman Mao in the remote border areas. We saw slogans engraved on the rocks by the roadside saying "Wishing Chairman Mao good health". When we left Ganzi, the comrades of the troops entering Tibet repeatedly told us: "We are thinking of Chairman Mao all the time. When we think of him, we are not afraid of any difficulties."

### 在伟大祖国的康藏高原

    在伟大祖国的康藏高原
    中国人民赴朝慰问团西南分团、川西西康工作队  刘文权、丁  乙
    没有到过康藏高原的人，总以为康藏高原是一片荒凉的地方；但到了康藏高原，却看见这里是一片雄伟壮丽的天地。
    我们到西康省雅安以后，沿着人民解放军入藏部队新开辟的康藏公路，翻过了拔海三、四千公尺的二郎山和折多山。在高山深谷间，汽车每小时只能爬行六、七公里，一面是高耸的悬崖峭壁，另一面是奔放的江流。当我们在这惊险的道路上前进时，不能不想起当初开辟这条路的英雄们——那为了建设祖国边疆，逢山开路，遇水造桥，吃尽千辛万苦，战胜了困难的入藏部队。
    过了折多山，高原的富饶景象使我们感到惊喜。这里有大小起伏的山岗，有广阔碧绿的草原。层层的雪山在天边放射着万道金光。半山腰的林木间，常见有建筑壮丽的喇嘛寺。在山脚的平野地带，一片片的金色青稞麦田，万紫千红的菀豆花开遍了原野。在牧场上，到处可以看到大群大群牦牛和绵羊。鲜花艳草围绕着牧篷，放牧的藏胞男女在放情地唱着山歌，他们欢迎我们，在路旁翘起大拇指向我们欢呼：“毛主席的代表！”“亚莫亚算的！”
    （顶好的意思）
    我们经天全、泸定、康定，深入到康藏高原的道孚和甘孜。道孚附近，遍地是长得比人还高的青稞和小麦。入藏的人民解放军在甘孜地区开垦了许多肥美的土地。在他们的驻地附近，差不多都有一个小菜园满种了萝卜和白菜。一位战士告诉我们，他们曾在一亩地里收了三千多斤马铃薯。
    康藏高原的土、特产和地下宝藏的丰富更令人兴奋。在康定的土产展览会上，我们看到了名贵的熊胆、熊掌、鹿茸、麝香、藏?、藏花、虫草、虎皮、豹皮和许多珍奇野兽的皮毛。行车途中，我们见过不少闪闪发光的露天煤层。炉霍、德格地区，蕴藏着丰富的铜和铁。昌都附近埋藏着珍贵的石油。宁静山中有一条河沟，水面上飘浮着一层浓的矿油，藏民们都拿来点灯。康北邓柯盛产云母，藏民有用云母片来糊窗户的。高原上产金更多，炉霍县一个藏民，曾在三天内挖得矿金七十多两。
    这片富饶的土地，刚刚回到了人民的怀抱，藏、彝、汉各民族的人民，对人民祖国与中朝人民军队的热爱，对于阴谋再来奴役中国人民的美帝国主义的仇恨心情是可以理解的。在康藏各地，我们向各民族各界人民和当地驻军，作了六十五次传达报告，演出了各种文娱节目三十六次，与我们接触的七万多人，包括各地的土司、头人和喇嘛寺的活佛、僧众，都以狂热的心情来和我们见面。他们说：“毛主席是真活佛，你们是毛主席的代表，请在活佛的位置上坐吧。”很多藏民带着酥油、?粑和帐篷，从几十里之外骑着马来听报告。志愿军在朝鲜前线的英勇事迹，感动了各民族人民的心。喇嘛寺的门口贴上了爱国公约，炉霍县居民组织起来，帮助长征时代红军战士和新成立的藏民团战士的家属耕地。甘孜县是一个二万多人口的地区，就捐献了一亿五千万元人民币给志愿军买飞机大炮。康定木雅区一位六十多岁的藏民老太太说：“十多年来我第一次穿上一双新鞋子，我捐出一斤酥油来感谢志愿军。”
    我们在康藏高原同时慰问了解放军入藏部队。我们进入西藏的解放军部队和在朝鲜前线的志愿军一样，他们以同样崇高的爱国主义与乐观主义的精神，在为保卫祖国、建设祖国的边疆而努力。我们英勇的进入西藏的人民解放军，他们在遥远的边疆怀念着我们的毛主席，我们见到路旁的岩石上刻着“遥祝毛主席身体健康”的标语。在我们离开甘孜时，入藏部队的同志们一再告诉我们说：“我们时时刻刻想着毛主席，我们一想起他，什么困难也不怕了。”
