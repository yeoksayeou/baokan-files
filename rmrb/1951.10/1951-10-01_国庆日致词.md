National Day Address
Zhang Lan

Today is the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is a great joyous event for all Chinese people. When the People's Republic of China was first founded two years ago, Chairman Mao said that the Chinese people had stood up. The facts of the past two years have proven that Chairman Mao's words were wise and correct. All Chinese people have never been able to participate in politics so freely as they can today. China has never enjoyed such high international prestige as it does today. No matter how the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang try to increase the difficulties of our construction and use all kinds of shameless language to slander our success, their conspiracy is in vain. We will surely continue to advance, and we will surely achieve greater and more glorious victories.

In the past, the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang left us with many difficulties. However, in this short period of two years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have gradually overcome these difficulties and achieved great achievements in all aspects. Politically, we have consolidated the work of building a people's democratic government. People's representative conferences have been held universally in all counties across the country. We have basically eliminated bandits, suppressed secret agents, bandit leaders, local bullies, and other counter-revolutionaries. We have peacefully resolved the Tibet issue, greatly consolidating the unity and friendship of various ethnic groups in the Southwest. What is particularly important is that our land reform work is continuing thoroughly in various places. It is expected that by next year, we will have completed land reform throughout the country except for minority ethnic regions. The complete elimination of the feudal land system and the economic elimination of the landlord class will be an epoch-making victory for all Chinese people. Furthermore, with the unfolding of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, patriotic education is being deeply instilled among the broad masses of the people across the country. The political awareness of the people throughout the country has been greatly enhanced.

As for the economic front, we have also achieved great victories. We have curbed the hyperinflation of the Kuomintang reactionary government for many years, strengthened the leading position of state-owned enterprises in production, and promoted the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Due to the success of land reform and the state's policy of supporting agriculture, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has increased, and agricultural production has also greatly increased. In factories, the general productivity has also exceeded the standards of the Japanese imperialist invasion period and the Kuomintang reactionary rule period. As for the construction of railways and farmland water conservancy projects, the state's investment has exceeded that of any period under Kuomintang rule. This year's Huai River project has made great achievements. All of the above work could only have been completed under the new regime.

Now we must explain the reasons why we have been able to overcome so many difficulties and achieve such great victories in such a short period of time. Here, we must first thank the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, thank the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are fighting bravely on the front lines to defend the motherland and defend peace, thank the Party and non-Party cadres who are working selflessly for the motherland and the people, and thank the tens of thousands of working people who are working hard on the production front.

However, we cannot be complacent about the achievements of the past two years. We must continue to overcome difficulties, strengthen and consolidate past achievements, and accelerate the development of our new cause in the future. We must keep in mind that, up to this day, our Taiwan is still in the hands of American imperialism and the Chiang bandits. We must keep in mind that the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea has not stopped. We must keep in mind that American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are still trying to intervene in our affairs by armed force and undermine our new democratic regime and our production and construction at all times. Recently, British and American imperialism have even torn up international agreements, disregarded the declarations and protests of our Central People's Government and all Chinese people, openly made a separate peace with Japan, and rearmed the Japanese warlords. Obviously, the main purpose of these measures by American imperialism is to invade Korea and China, to turn Japan into its colony, to enslave the people of the entire Asia, and to provoke a third world war. We fully understand these conspiracies of American imperialism. Therefore, in the future, we must strengthen the unity of the people throughout the country, strengthen the great unity of the people of all parties, classes, ethnic groups, and between Party members and non-Party members, so that the enemy will not have any opportunity to alienate us and divide us. We must strengthen our national defense forces. We must have a modern army, navy, and air force, and mobilize more young people to participate in military cadre schools, so that we have sufficient strength to defend our own territory and our own people. Let the imperialists know that the people of New China are inviolable. We must continue to strengthen the suppression of secret agents, bandit leaders, local bullies, and other counter-revolutionaries, and eliminate the secret agents and bandits lurking in the country. We must continue to develop and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and further deepen the ideological education of patriotism. Any pro-American, worshipful, or fearful ideas of America must be exposed and attacked. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have achieved many great achievements. We believe that in the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the help of the great friendly country of the Soviet Union and other new democratic friendly countries, we will continue to overcome difficulties and continue to advance. We have all the strength to build an independent, free, prosperous, and happy New China, and we have the strength to defend world peace!

Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!
Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao!

    国庆日致词
    张澜
    今天是中华人民共和国成立的两周年纪念日。这是全中国人民的大喜事。当两年前中华人民共和国成立之初，毛主席就曾说过，我们中国人民已经站起来了。经过这两年来的事实证明，毛主席的话是英明的正确的。全中国人民从来没有像今天这样能够自由参与政治。我们中国也从来没有像今天这样能够享受到这样高的国际荣誉。不管帝国主义者，蒋介石匪帮怎样用一切办法来增加我们建设的困难，用一切无耻的语言来诽谤我们的成功，但他们的阴谋是徒然的，我们必定继续前进，我们必定获得更伟大更光荣的胜利。
    过去帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，曾留下了给我们不少的困难，但就这短短的两年的时间中，我们在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下逐步的克服了困难，在各方面获得了巨大的成就。在政治上，我们巩固了人民民主的建政工作，在全国各县，普遍的开了人民代表会议；基本上肃清了土匪，镇压了特务、匪首、恶霸等反革命分子；和平解决了西藏问题，大大的巩固了西南各民族的团结和友谊。尤其重要的，就是我们的土地改革工作，正在各地继续彻底进行，预计到了明年，除少数民族地区外，我们就将在全国范围内完成土地改革。彻底消灭封建的土地制度和从经济上消灭地主阶级，这将是全中国人民划时代的胜利。再就是由于抗美援朝运动的展开，爱国主义的教育已正在深入到全国广大的群众当中。全国人民的政治觉悟，已大大的提高了。
    至于在经济方面，我们同样也获得了巨大的胜利。我们制止了国民党反动政府多年来的恶性通货膨胀，加强了国营企业在生产上的领导地位，促进了城乡物资的交流。由于土地改革的成功，国家实行扶助农业的政策，农民的生产积极性提高，农业生产量也大大的增加了。而在工厂里，一般的生产率也超过了日本帝国主义侵略时期和国民党反动统治时期的标准。至于修建铁路，兴建农田水利的事业，国家的投资更是超出国民党统治的任何时期。今年治淮工作已有了很大的成绩。以上这些工作，显然都是只有在新政权底下才有可能完成的。
    现在我们必须说明，我们之所以能够在这样短的时间内，克服这样多的困难，获得这样大的胜利的原因。这里，我们首先就得感谢中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，就得感谢那些在前线，为保卫祖国保卫和平，而浴血奋战的中国人民志愿军，就得感谢那些为祖国为人民忘我地工作着的党与非党的干部，就得感谢成千整万的，在生产战线上努力奋斗的劳动人民。
    但是，对于过去两年来的成绩，我们还是不能自满的。我们今后还要继续克服困难，加强巩固过去的成绩，加速发展我们新的事业。我们必须紧记着，直到今天为止，我们的台湾还在美帝国主义和蒋匪手中。我们必须紧记着美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，还未停止。我们必须紧记着，美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮还无时无刻不在想武装干涉我们，破坏我们的新民主主义政权，破坏我们的生产建设。最近美英帝国主义更不惜撕毁国际协定，无视我中央人民政府和全中国人民的声明和抗议，公然与日本单独媾和，重新武装日本军阀。显然的，美帝国主义的这些措施的主要目的，就是要侵略朝鲜和中国，就是要把日本变成它的殖民地，要奴役整个亚洲的人民，要挑动第三次世界大战。对于美帝国主义的这些阴谋，我们是完全了解的。所以我们今后必须加强全国人民的团结，加强各党派间，各阶级间，各民族间，党和非党之间的全国人民的大团结，不让敌人有任何机会离间我们，分化我们。我们必须加强国防力量，我们要有现代化的陆军、海军和空军，动员更多的青年去参加军事干部学校，使得我们有充分的力量来保卫自己的疆土自己的人民。让帝国主义者知道，新中国的人民是不可侵犯的。我们必须继续加强对特务、匪首、恶霸等反革命分子的镇压，肃清潜伏在国内的特务匪徒。我们必须继续展开和深入抗美援朝运动，更加深爱国主义的思想教育，对于任何亲美、崇美、恐美的思想都必须加以揭露和打击。在过去两年间我们在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，曾获得了许多巨大的成就，我们相信，今后我们仍将在共产党和毛主席领导之下，在伟大的友邦苏联，以及其他新民主主义友邦帮助之下，继续克服困难，继续前进；我们是有一切力量来建立起独立、自由、繁荣、幸福的新中国的，我们是有力量来保卫世界和平的。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
