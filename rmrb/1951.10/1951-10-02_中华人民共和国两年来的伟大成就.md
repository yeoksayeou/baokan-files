    The great People's Republic of China has been established for two years. In these two years, all the territory except Taiwan has been liberated; a consolidated people's democratic dictatorship has been established; an unprecedented unity has emerged across the country; China has leapt from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country to a world power; the whole country rejoices, and the whole world cheers.
    The achievements of the past two years are brilliant and splendid; the progress is rapid. In terms of military affairs: Hunan, Guangdong, and the Great Southwest were liberated, and finally, Tibet was peacefully liberated, completing the unification of the mainland, and basically eliminating the historical banditry throughout the country, stabilizing social order. Since the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, from October 25 last year to September 5 this year, five major victories have been fought, annihilating more than 300,200 invading enemy troops, forcing the enemy to accept Malik's proposal for armistice negotiations. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the people of the whole country have been widely and deeply educated in patriotism, basically eliminating the ideas of "pro-America," "worshipping America," and "fearing America," forming a huge force between the front and the rear; the people of the whole country have also enthusiastically donated nearly four trillion yuan to purchase airplanes and artillery. In terms of diplomacy: our country has established diplomatic relations with 19 countries including the Soviet Union, and has signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Soviet Union, and trade or cultural agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia and other countries. Six countries including the United Kingdom have also announced their recognition of the People's Republic of China. In terms of political and social reform: the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has been carried out vigorously throughout the country; land reform has been completed in areas with more than 310 million agricultural population nationwide, and democratic reform movements have also been launched in cities, establishing and consolidating people's democratic systems at all levels in a step-by-step manner. This has inspired the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, expanded and strengthened the people's democratic united front, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and ensured the smooth progress of various national production and construction tasks. In terms of economy: industrial and agricultural production has been restored and developed. Although the rainfall this year is not as good as last year, agricultural production of rice has increased by 8% compared with last year, reaching 92.8% of the level before the War of Resistance against Japan in 1936, and the old liberated areas have reached or exceeded the level before the War of Resistance against Japan. National industrial construction has also had a good start, with the working class in Northeast China preparing to increase production and save wealth equivalent to 10 million tons of grain in one year. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party, the broad masses of the people have carried out a victorious struggle against natural disasters, reducing the area of ​​disaster-stricken fields from 120 million mu the year before last, to 70 million mu last year, to 40 million mu this year. Millions of farmers and hundreds of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers participated in water conservancy construction, and the first phase of the great Huai River harnessing project has been completed. With the development of production, national commerce continues to improve, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has been strengthened, the off-season has turned into the peak season, prices have remained relatively stable, and foreign trade has also changed from a historically import surplus to an export surplus. In terms of culture, education and health: there are 37 million elementary school students nationwide, exceeding 55% of the pre-War of Resistance against Japan level. This year, 10 million people participated in year-round literacy schools, and more than 1.5 million people participated in vocational and industrial spare-time schools. In terms of medicine and health, under the principle of "prevention first," infectious diseases have been significantly reduced, and cholera no longer occurs.
    Since the establishment of the great People's Republic of China, such brilliant achievements and rapid progress have been achieved in just two short years, entirely due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, due to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people in 30 years of revolutionary struggle, training a strong and huge armed force and working cadres, and accumulating extremely rich experience. All the achievements and progress in these two years are the flowering and fruiting of 30 years of struggle.
    Now, there are 5.8 million Communist Party members and millions of People's Liberation Army soldiers in China, which are the backbone of all current reform and construction work. Without so many and such strong backbones, there could not have been such achievements and progress in these two years. The 5.8 million Communist Party members and millions of People's Liberation Army soldiers, under the education and leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, serve the people wholeheartedly and consistently, and never plan for the interests of individuals or a few people. Only in this way can they gain the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, and can they unite the broad masses of the people; only on the basis of uniting the broad masses of the people can they resolutely implement all reforms and actively carry out all construction.
    The main reason for all the achievements and progress in the past two years lies in the unwavering and thorough reforms that have been carried out. In the War of Liberation, imperialism had already been driven out of China, and the reactionary chieftain Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, sheltered by imperialism, had been overthrown. Immediately afterwards, a vigorous campaign was launched to clear out bandits, oppose local bullies, carry out land reform, democratic reform, and vigorously suppress counter-revolutionaries. In this series of reform movements, the broad masses of the people stood up and united under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, advancing bravely, thoroughly clearing obstacles on the one hand and actively carrying out construction on the other, giving the entire society a new look. Some people said excitedly: "I have personally seen bad people turn into good people, and old people turn into young people." Others said: "The new China after this revolution is already as solid as a wall of bronze and iron." Facts have proved that letting go of mobilizing the masses, thoroughly carrying out social reform, overthrowing all reactionary systems, eliminating all counter-revolutionary forces, and carrying the revolution through to the end are the main keys to achieving all the achievements and progress in the past two years.
    All the achievements and progress in the past two years have been achieved on the basis of unity. In the past, under reactionary rule in China, because the reactionaries were extremely selfish and self-interested, they themselves were fighting and killing each other. Just look at the past few decades, from the Northern Warlords to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the internal contradictions within the ruling faction were full of conflicts, divided and fragmented, fighting openly and secretly, and endless chaos, which is ironclad proof. The reactionary rulers completely violated the interests of the people, they deceived the people, oppressed the people, and used factions and contradictions to create factions and contradictions in order to facilitate their rule; unity was absolutely detrimental to reactionary rule, and therefore the reactionary rulers have always hated unity. In the past, everyone sighed that "China is a plate of loose sand." Is the Chinese national character a plate of loose sand, unable to unite? Now, the facts have proven that only under feudal rule, especially under the rule of reactionaries manipulated by various imperialists, is it impossible to unite and unnecessary to unite. Since reactionary rule was overthrown, the Chinese people have been able to unite and urgently need to unite, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they have already united consistently. For two years, the People's Governments at all levels, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, have adhered to the correct policy of striving for, transforming, and uniting, so that the ethnic disputes that could never be properly resolved in Chinese history are now called fraternal ethnic groups, and they have united very well. The petty bourgeoisie, which is inherently difficult to unite, has also gradually united due to obtaining patient efforts and transformation. The great unity of the people of the whole country is indeed our greatest achievement, and only on the basis of this great unity can we achieve all the achievements and progress in the past two years. However, without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and without thorough social reform, it would be impossible for China to achieve such great unity.
    All the achievements and progress in the past two years have been achieved on the basis of stability. To achieve thorough reform on the basis of stability, and to seek fundamental stability from the process of thorough reform, is a very difficult task; but in the past two years, such a miracle has indeed occurred. This is entirely the result of the People's Governments at all levels adhering to the correct policies of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, planning carefully, taking accurate steps, and carrying out work in an orderly manner. Take Hunan as an example in these two years: before liberation, the reactionaries spread all kinds of rumors, and people's hearts were somewhat confused and uneasy. Under reactionary rule, bandits, local bullies, gang members, secret agents, party thugs, group thugs, and hooligan gangsters ran rampant, and the entire social order was extremely chaotic. Since liberation, the People's Liberation Army entered Hunan, with strict military discipline, humble and simple working cadres, hard-working and enduring, and loyally serving the people, first breaking all the rumors, and the people thereby realized that the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of the Chinese people. Immediately afterwards, they quickly defeated Li Bai's bandit army, liberated the entire Hunan, eliminated bandits throughout the province, stabilized prices, vigorously called for production and disaster relief, led the people through a severe spring famine, won the first bumper year, and promoted the improvement of industry and commerce; other industrial and mining transportation and even cultural and educational undertakings were quickly restored and developed. This series of facts has won the unanimous and extremely warm praise and support of the people of the entire province, and the people of the entire province have been closely united under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. On the other hand, all counter-revolutionary elements, initially lurking, then stirred up trouble. When the US imperialist invading army landed at Incheon in Korea, the counter-revolutionary elements became even more active in taking advantage of the opportunity. The broad masses of the people in the province were extremely resentful of the counter-revolutionary elements and unanimously demanded that the counter-revolutionaries be punished and that all counter-revolutionary elements be eliminated. The People's Government accepted the demands of the people of the entire province and began to carry out various social transformations vigorously, resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In carrying out various movements, they all let go of mobilizing the masses, absolutely relying on the masses, and advancing steadily with well-ordered steps, so that not only did it not affect social order, but it also further consolidated social order. Hunan has gone through this way, and the whole country is roughly the same. Carrying out thorough reform in fundamental stability completely preserved vitality and greatly benefited all construction and progress. However, without the rich experience accumulated by the Chinese Communist Party for 30 years as a policy guide, and without 5.8 million strong and experienced party members as the backbone of the work, it would be impossible to be so stable and just right.
    The traditional fine qualities of the Chinese nation are also one of the reasons for all the achievements and progress in the past two years. The Chinese nation has always been brave, simple, hardworking, intelligent and creative. The 30 years of heroic struggle history of the Chinese Communist Party has fully demonstrated this point. In these two years, the many heroic deeds shown by the People's Liberation Army on the battlefield of eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army and clearing out bandits, the People's Volunteers on the battlefield of defeating the US and South Korean bandit army in Korea, the sincere and hardworking spirit of serving the people shown by all working cadres in various work posts, and even everything shown by the broad masses of the people, starting from patriotism, in production and donations, are all sufficient to show that the Chinese people after liberation have fully carried forward the traditional fine qualities of the Chinese nation and created the brilliant achievements and rapid progress of these two years.
    In the past two years, on the basis of social reform, on the basis of the great unity of the people of the whole country, and on the basis of the fundamental stability of the entire social order, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led the People's Governments at all levels and the people of the whole country to fully carry forward the traditional fine qualities of the Chinese nation, defeated the reactionary ruling forces, defeated the invasion of US imperialism, established a consolidated people's democratic regime, and widely laid the foundation for the development of national defense, politics, diplomacy, economy, culture, and education, and have opened up a broad road for future planned construction. We are stepping up preparations for planned construction, and in the future, under planned construction, a more grand scale and more rapid progress will inevitably appear. We are winning greater victories from victory, and we are striving for faster progress from progress.
    We sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for leading the Chinese people's revolution and creating the great People's Republic of China.
    We sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for leading the people of the whole country to struggle, sincerely thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers for fighting heroically, sincerely thank the combat heroes and labor models for their special contributions, and sincerely thank all working comrades and the working people of the whole country for their consistent efforts.
    We unite consistently under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and continue to advance bravely! Resolutely continue to struggle for Resist America, Aid Korea, land reform, democratic reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and building a new China. We have the strength and confidence to build our motherland, defend our motherland, and defend world lasting peace. We unanimously cheer Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao!

    中华人民共和国两年来的伟大成就
    程潜
    伟大的中华人民共和国成立两年了。这两年中，解放了除开台湾以外的全部国土；建立了巩固的人民民主专政；全国出现空前大团结的局面；中国由半殖民地半封建的国家，一跃而为世界强大的国家；全国为之欢跃，全世界为之欢呼。
    两年来的成就是光辉灿烂的；进步是突飞猛进的。就军事讲：解放了湖南、两广和大西南，最后和平解放了西藏，完成了大陆的统一，并基本上肃清了全国历史性的匪患，安定了社会秩序。抗美援朝运动开始以来，从去年十月二十五日到今年九月五日，前后打了五个大胜仗，歼灭侵朝敌军达三十万零二千余人，迫使敌人接受马立克停战谈判的建议。全国人民在抗美援朝运动中，广泛深入地受到爱国主义思想教育，基本肃清了“亲美”、“崇美”、“恐美”思想，使前方后方结成了一个巨大的力量；全国人民并踊跃捐献了近四万亿元，购买飞机大炮。就外交讲：我国已和苏联等十九个国家建立了外交关系，并已与苏联签订了中苏友好同盟条约，和波兰、捷克等国签订了贸易或文化协定。英国等六国亦宣布承认了中华人民共和国。就政治和社会改革讲：全国大张旗鼓镇压了反革命；全国已有三亿一千万以上农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，城市中也展开了民主改革运动，有步骤地建立和巩固了各级人民民主制度。因而启发了广大人民的政治积极性，扩大和加强了人民民主统一战线，巩固了人人民民主专政，保证国家各项生产建设工作的顺利进行。就经济讲：工农业生产已得到恢复和发展。今年雨水虽不如去年，但农业生产稻谷比去年增产了百分之八，已达到抗战前一九三六年水平的百分之九十二点八，老区已经达到或超过抗战前水平。全国工业建设也有了良好的开始，东北工人阶级在一年内准备增产节约相当一千万吨粮食的财富。在人民政府和共产党的领导下，广大人民与灾荒进行了胜利的斗争，受灾田亩面积，由前年的一亿二千万亩，去年的七千万亩，减到了今年的四千万亩。全国有数百万农民和几十万解放军参加水利建设，伟大的治淮工程第一期已告完成。随着生产的发展，全国商业继续好转，城乡物资交流加强了，淡月变成了旺月，物价保持相对的稳定，对外贸易也由一向入超改变为出超了。就文教卫生讲：全国小学生有三千七百万，超过抗日战争前的百分之五十五，今年有一千万人参加了常年民校，一百五十万人以上参加了职工业余学校。医药卫生方面，在“预防为主”的方针下，已使传染病显著减少，霍乱病已经不发生了。
    伟大的中华人民共和国成立以后，在短短的两年当中获得了这样辉煌的成就和飞跃的进步，完全由于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，由于中国共产党和毛主席领导中国人民在三十年的革命斗争中，锻炼了坚强而庞大的武装和工作干部，累积了极其丰富的经验。这两年来一切成就和进步，乃是三十年奋斗的开花结果。
    现在，中国有共产党员五百八十万，有人民解放军数百万，这是当前一切改革和建设工作的骨干。没有这样多，这样坚强的骨干，这两年就不可能有这样的成就和进步。五百八十万共产党员和数百万人民解放军是在党和毛主席的教育和领导之下，一致地全心全意为人民服务，从来不为个人或少数人的利益打算，只有这样，才能获得广大人民群众的热烈拥护，才能团结广大人民群众；在团结广大人民群众的基础上，才能坚决执行一切改革，积极进行一切建设。
    两年来一切成就和进步，主要的原因在于坚定不移地进行了彻底的改革。在解放战争中已经把帝国主义赶出了中国，已经把帝国主义所卵翼的反动头子蒋介石匪帮推翻，紧接着就轰轰烈烈地进行清剿土匪、反对恶霸、土地改革、民主改革，以及大张旗鼓镇压反革命。在这一连串的改革运动当中，广大人民群众站起来了，而且团结起来了，团结在中国共产党和毛主席的旗帜之下，奋勇前进，一面彻底清除障碍，一面积极进行建设，使整个社会面目一新。有人很兴奋地说：“亲眼看到了坏人变成好人，老人变成青年。”又有人说：“经过了这次革命的新中国，已经是铜墙铁壁。”事实证明，放手发动群众，彻底进行社会改革，推翻一切反动制度，肃清一切反革命势力，把革命进行到底，乃是获得两年来一切成就和进步的主要关键。
    两年来一切成就和进步，是在团结的基础上面获得的，以前反动统治下的中国，因为反动派极端自私自利，他本身就互相倾轧，互相争杀，只要看近数十年来，从北洋军阀到蒋介石匪帮，统治派内部矛盾百出，四分五裂，明争暗斗，混战不休，就是铁证。反动统治者完全违反人民利益，它们欺骗人民，压迫人民，并且利用派别和矛盾，制造派别和矛盾，以达到便于统治的目的；团结是绝对不利于反动统治的，因而反动统治者向来是仇视团结的。以前大家叹息“中国是一盘散沙”，难道中国民族性是一盘散沙，无法团结的吗？现在事实证明，只有在封建统治之下，尤其是在各帝国主义操纵的反动派统治之下，才无法团结，也不需要团结。自从反动统治被推翻以后，中国人民就可能团结，也迫切需要团结了，在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，就已经一致团结起来了。两年以来，各级人民政府在毛主席的正确领导之下，坚持争取、改造和团结的正确方针，使中国历史上从来无法适当解决的民族纠纷，现在称为兄弟民族，已经一致地团结得很好。在本质上很难团结的小资产阶级，由于获得耐心争取和改造，也都逐渐地团结起来了。现在全国人民的大团结，确是我们最伟大的成就，也只有在这个大团结的基础上，才可能获得两年来的一切成就和进步。但是，如果没有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，如果没有经过彻底的社会改革，中国是不可能获得这样伟大的团结的。
    两年来一切成就和进步，是在安定的基础上获得的。要在安定的基础上做到彻底的改革；又要从彻底的改革过程中求得根本的安定，这是一件非常困难的事；但是两年来确实出现了这么一个奇迹。这完全是各级人民政府坚持毛主席和中国共产党的正确政策，计划周详，步骤准确，有条不紊地进行工作的结果。就拿湖南这两年的经过来讲吧：在解放以前，反动派散布各种谣言，人心是有些惶惑不安，在反动统治之下，土匪、恶霸、帮匪、特务、党棍子、团棍子以及流氓地痞横行，整个社会秩序极其紊乱。自从解放以后，人民解放军进入湖南，军纪严明，工作干部谦虚质朴，刻劳耐苦，忠诚为人民服务，首先把一切谣言击破了，人民从而认识到中国共产党和毛主席是中国人民的救星。紧接着，又迅速地击溃了李白匪军，解放了全湖南，肃清了全省的土匪，安定了物价，大力号召生产救灾，领导人民度过了严重的春荒，争取了头一个丰年，促进了工商业的好转；其他工矿交通以至文教事业，都迅速地恢复而且发展了。这一连串的事实，更博得全省人民一致的极其热烈的赞扬和拥护，全省人民已经紧紧地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的旗帜之下了。另一方面，一切反革命分子，最初是潜伏，既而就骚动，当美帝国主义侵略军在朝鲜仁川登陆以后，反革命分子就更加乘机活跃。全省广大人民对反革命分子是极端愤恨的，一致要求惩处反革命，肃清一切反革命分子。人民政府接受了全省人民的要求，开始轰轰烈烈地进行各种社会改造，坚决镇压反革命。在进行各种运动当中，都是放手发动群众，绝对依靠群众，步骤井然地稳步前进，这样就不仅不影响社会秩序，反而更加巩固了社会秩序。湖南经过如此，全国也大体相同。在根本安定中进行彻底改革，就完全保存了元气，就大有利于一切建设和进步。但是，如果没有中国共产党三十年累积的丰富经验作为政策的指导，和五百八十万坚强练达的党员作为工作的骨干，决不可能稳健到这么恰到好处。
    中华民族传统的优良品质，也是两年来一切成就和进步的原因之一。中华民族一向是勇敢、朴实、勤劳、聪明而又富有创造性的。中国共产党三十年的英勇奋斗历史，已经充分说明了这一点。在这两年当中，人民解放军在消灭蒋介石匪军和肃清土匪的战场上，人民志愿军在朝鲜击溃美李匪军的战场上所表现的许多英雄事迹，一切工作干部在各个工作岗位上所表现的真诚勤劳为人民服务的坚贞精神，以至广大人民从爱国主义出发，在生产和捐献当中所表现的一切，都足以说明获得解放以后的中国人民，已充分发扬了中华民族传统的优良品质，创造了这两年来的辉煌成就和飞跃进步。
    两年来在社会改革的基础上，在全国人民大团结的基础上，在整个社会秩序根本安定的基础上，中国共产党和毛主席领导各级人民政府和全国人民，充分发扬了中华民族传统的优良品性，打垮了反动统治势力，击溃了美帝国主义的侵略，建立了巩固的人民民主政权，广泛地奠定了国防、政治、外交、经济、文教的发展基础，已经开辟了今后计划建设的康庄大道。我们正在加紧准备计划建设，将来在计划建设之下，必然更要出现一个规模更加宏大，进步更加迅速的伟大局面。我们正由胜利争取更大的胜利，正由进步争取更快的进步。
    我们衷心感谢中国共产党和毛主席领导中国人民革命，创造了伟大的中华人民共和国。
    我们衷心感谢中国共产党和毛主席领导全国人民奋斗，衷心感谢中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军英勇作战，衷心感谢战斗英雄们、劳动模范们特殊的贡献，衷心感谢全体工作同志和全国劳动人民一致的努力。
    我们一致团结在中国共产党和毛主席的旗帜之下，继续奋勇前进！坚决为抗美援朝，为土地改革，为民主改革，为镇压反革命，为建设新中国而继续斗争。我们有力量有信心建设祖国，保卫祖国，保卫世界持久和平。我们一致欢呼中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党万岁！伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
