The People's Republic of China has been established for two years. Over the past two years, our achievements on the economic front, like those in politics, have been great. These achievements are: fundamentally changing the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic situation of old China; rapidly restoring the national economy on the path of New Democracy; initially improving the material life of the people and increasing the production enthusiasm of the working people; and implementing the policy of "giving consideration to both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchange." The state-owned economy has maintained its leadership, and various social economic components have divided labor and cooperated, each fulfilling its role. How were these achievements obtained? This is the result of faithfully implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, faithfully implementing the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the result of the policy of "adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship and uniting international friends," and the result of the active labor of workers and peasants and the united struggle of the people of the whole country. The achievements of China's people in economic construction over the past two years are summarized below:

I. The Semi-Colonial and Semi-Feudal Economic Situation Has Been Fundamentally Changed

Land reform and the elimination of bandits and despots are necessary conditions for developing the productive forces and national industrialization. The work of clearing bandits and combating local bullies, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries has now basically ended in most parts of the country; land reform has been completed among 76 percent of the rural population, that is, more than 310 million farmers have realized "land to the tiller"; in the remaining 24 percent of the rural population, struggles against local bullies, rent reduction, and deposit refunds have been carried out, and land distribution can be carried out this winter and next year, except for ethnic minority areas. Therefore, the feudal and semi-feudal land system has been fundamentally changed. The landlord class has been overthrown, and the productive forces of the peasants have been liberated. The rapid recovery of China's agriculture and the rapid transformation of important industrial products from sluggish sales to high demand in the past two years are mainly the direct result of land reform. The purchasing power of peasants has increased, and the state of poverty has changed; sales of yarn, cloth, fertilizer (mainly soybean cake and oil cake), coal, steel, soda ash, and other important daily necessities have increased rapidly in 1951, which has powerfully promoted the recovery of industry.

China's industry is now an independent and autonomous industry serving the people, no longer a tool for imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism to plunder the people. The economic privileges of imperialism in China have been basically abolished, all bureaucratic capital has been confiscated into the property of the people's state, and the industries of national capital have also stood up. This is another condition for the rapid recovery of industry. In 1951, whether it was heavy industry or light industry, the equipment utilization rate generally exceeded the highest level in Chinese history, except for a few industrial sectors such as woolen textiles, cigarettes, matches, and rubber shoes. This is because of the independence and autonomy of industry, the people's need for a large number of industrial products, and the implementation of a protective trade policy for foreign trade, and the mutually beneficial trade between our country and the Soviet Union and New Democratic countries. The situation in which the raw material supply, finished product production, and sales of our country's major production sectors were not connected has undergone a fundamental change. For example, the production of iron ore, pig iron, steel ingots, and steel has been linked together, and the output of steel ingots and steel has been actively restored and increased, and the output of iron ore has been appropriately restricted, initially changing the historical situation of large exports of iron ore and pig iron and large imports of steel. This provides favorable conditions for the planning of China's economy.

The semi-colonial customs that served imperialism for a long time have become the people's own customs in the past two years, completely independent and autonomous. The key to protecting trade is in the hands of the Chinese people themselves, and the privilege of foreign ships sailing in our inland rivers has also been abolished. This has fundamentally changed the state of foreign trade in the new China from that of the old China. First of all, my country's foreign trade has basically gotten rid of its long-term dependence on capitalist countries in the past. In the past two years, the most important and large part of my country's foreign trade has been trade with the Soviet Union and New Democratic countries, and trade with capitalist countries has dropped sharply. The illegal embargo imposed on our country by US and British imperialism has little impact on our economy, but the US and British imperialist countries have been more affected. Even so, we are still willing to continue to implement Article 57 of the Common Program, "to restore and develop trade relations with the governments and peoples of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." Secondly, in terms of exports, the People's Government actively organizes the export of my country's surplus agricultural products, animal products, mineral products, and handicrafts, which has made the total export value in 1950 and 1951 exceed the record before 1931: If the total export value in 1936 is 100, and one US dollar at that time is calculated as two US dollars now, then the total export value in 1950 is 134, and the total export value in 1951 will be 160; the increasing export trade has powerfully promoted the active production of my country's agricultural products, sideline products, mineral products, and handicrafts. Furthermore, in terms of imports, old China has long relied heavily on daily necessities such as cotton, wheat, rice, and sack, and luxury goods such as cigarettes. In 1951, my country's grain and industrial raw materials for agricultural products, except for rubber, have been fundamentally solved or initially solved, and the import ratio of hardware equipment, machinery, and instruments has greatly increased. This reflects the rapid recovery of my country's industry and agriculture. With the continued recovery and development of my country's industrial and agricultural production, the import ratio of machinery will inevitably increase year by year, and the import of consumer goods and general industrial equipment will also decrease accordingly. This shows that with the victory of the people's revolution, customs autonomy, protection of trade, and land reform have cleared the way for my country's industrialization.

The semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic situation—the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of industry—will never return. The New Democratic People's Economy—the recovery and development of industry and the recovery and prosperity of the countryside—has achieved great achievements in the past two years under the active work of the working people.

II. The Achievements of the People's Economy in Recovery

The recovery of our people's economy is rapid. Comparing the expected output of major industrial and agricultural products in 1951 with the highest annual output of similar products in Chinese history, the output of major industrial and agricultural products in 1951 is close to the highest production level in history, except for major industrial and agricultural products such as pig iron, coal, wheat, and soybeans, and most of the less important products have exceeded it. In terms of transportation, the railway has been basically restored; shipping has recovered more slowly due to the severe looting and destruction by the Kuomintang reactionary government; the main lines of the national highway have been restored, and the transportation volume has also increased significantly. The recovery of trade is commensurate with the recovery of production. The recovery of the main sectors of the people's economy in the past two years is briefly described below:

Recovery of industry. Taking the highest annual output in history as 100
(Generally, the figures for 1936 are used for Guannei, and the figures for 1943 are generally used for Northeast China), the recovery of important industrial products in 1950 and 1951 is shown in the following table:
|                    | Highest Annual Output in History | 1950 Output | 1951 Expected Output |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Pig Iron           | 100                             | 48.5        | 64.0                 |
| Steel Ingot         | 100                             | 68.5        | 97.0                 |
| Steel              | 100                             | 67.0        | 120.0                |
| Coal               | 100                             | 58.6        | 69.2                 |
| Electricity        | 100                             | 77.5        | 94.5                 |
| Cement             | 100                             | 65.7        | 107.0                |
| Copper             | 100                             | 253.0       | 333.0                |
| Tungsten           | 100                             | 76.0        | 80.0                 |
| Tin                | 100                             | 38.1        | 46.0                 |
| Glass              | 100                             | 119.5       | 138.0                |
| Caustic Soda       | 100                             | 82.1        | 244.0                |
| Soda Ash           | 100                             | 97.1        | 124.0                |
| Cotton Yarn        | 100                             | 100.3       | 105.9                |
| Cotton Cloth       | 100                             | 108.7       | 113.5                |
| Sack               | 100                             | 43.4        | 98.5                 |
| Paper              | 100                             | 114.5       | 155.0                |
| Tires              | 100                             | 66.0        | 196.0                |

It can be seen from the above table that the expected output of pig iron, coal, and tin in 1951 is the farthest from the highest annual output in history. The highest annual output of iron and coal was the year (1942) when Japanese imperialism stole our country's wealth most fiercely, and a large amount of it was transported to Japan. The highest annual output of tin has only been in one year (1938) in history, and the difference between the years before and after is very large. The expected output of steel ingots, electricity, tungsten, and sack in 1951 is close to the highest annual output in history; among them, a considerable amount of electrical equipment has not been restored, but the output has approached the highest level in the past due to the increase in the output of existing equipment. All other items have exceeded. In the past two years, the capacity of industrial equipment in our country has not increased much, and the output of some products has increased a lot. This is the result of the improvement of labor productivity of employees and the improvement of equipment utilization rate.

Recovery of agriculture. Taking the highest annual output in history as 100
(Generally, the figures for 1936 or 1937 are used), the recovery of important agricultural products in 1950 and 1951 is shown in the following table:
|                      | Highest Annual Output in History | 1950 Output | 1951 Expected Output |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Grain                | 100                             | 87.0        | 92.8                 |
| Rice                 | 100                             | 96.5        | 99.4                 |
| Wheat                | 100                             | 80.4        | 88.5                 |
| Soybean              | 100                             | 58.9        | 63.3                 |
| Cotton               | 100                             | 83.7        | 133.0                |
| Oil Crops (excluding soybean) | 100                             | 44.0        | 65.9                 |
| Flue-cured Tobacco   | 100                             | 24.1        | 130.5                |
| Jute for Sack        | 100                             | 114.7       | 227.1                |

It can be seen from the above table that the grain output in 1951 is close to the highest annual output in history, but the soybean output is still low. The industrial raw material crops, cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and jute, have all exceeded the highest annual output in history. However, the output of oil crops is only two-thirds of the past highest output, and the output of tea, silk, and sugarcane is about one-fourth to one-third of the highest annual output in history. The production of sugar beets has exceeded the past highest level. This shows that my country's grain has changed the state of relying heavily on imports in the past, but the national storage is not sufficient and should be closely monitored. With the recovery and development of light industry, the demand for industrial raw materials for agricultural products is increasing. However, under Chinese conditions, the solution to this problem is not very difficult. The production of silk and tea must be actively restored, and the production of sugar beets must be increased. In terms of animal husbandry, the highest ownership of cattle, sheep, and pigs in history is low, and the statistics may not be complete. According to the current number of cattle, sheep, and pigs in the country, cattle and pigs may have recovered to about 80% of the past, and the recovery of sheep is about half of the past. Therefore, the recovery and development of animal husbandry still need to be vigorously promoted in the future.

The rapid recovery of agriculture, in addition to land reform as the main condition, also includes the struggle against nature and the power of organization. The most important work of the former is water conservancy construction, turning water damage into water conservancy, killing locusts and insects, and defeating insect pests; the most important work of the latter is to organize mutual aid and cooperation, agricultural cooperation, improve technology, and improve varieties.

The recovery of transportation is commensurate with the recovery of industry and agriculture. In the past two years, in the work of "mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges," overcoming several difficulties, transportation work has successfully completed its tasks. The volume of railway, shipping, and highway transportation has increased rapidly in the past two years. In terms of railway transportation, because my country's domestic trade is still dominated by north-south exchanges, and import and export trade is now also dominated by land transportation, this has greatly increased the task of railway transportation. The total volume of transportation in a year in history is unknown due to incomplete records. It is difficult to compare the recovery situation in the past two years with it; however, judging from the total output of commodities and the number of daily trains on major railways in 1951, the total volume of railway transportation in 1951 may exceed the highest level in history, and it will increase by 33.2% compared to 1950. In terms of shipping, before liberation, coastal and inland river routes were basically occupied by foreign ships. Taking 1936 as an example, the national ships on coastal routes were only more than 330,000 tons, while foreign ships within the country at this time were 1.2 million tons. In addition, there were often about 4 million tons of foreign ships entering and leaving my country's ports, and the total transportation volume for the whole year was more than 44.9 million tons. After liberation, the ships left behind by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, including sea ships and river ships, totaled only more than 260,000 tons, but from then on, my country's independent and autonomous shipping industry began. In terms of transportation volume, the transportation volume in 1950 was not high, and it increased by 75% in 1951 compared to 1950. In terms of highway transportation, the national highway trunk lines have been completely restored, and several new lines have been built. In terms of freight transportation, if the transportation volume in 1941 is 100, then it was 65% in 1950 and 118.7% in 1951. In addition, the recovery of wooden boats and animal-drawn vehicles is very rapid, but the transportation of wooden boats cannot be used for long-distance large cargo loads; therefore, actively restoring my country's shipping routes and fully utilizing the transportation capacity of existing ships is very important.

The recovery and development of trade is one of the keys to the rapid recovery of the people's economy in the past two years. Although the main production sectors of my country's industry and agriculture have not yet recovered to the highest production level in history, due to the vigorous organization of the People's Government of local product exchanges and the unprecedented development of the construction industry, the total commodity production value of the people's economy has increased rapidly, thus increasing the total trade volume. Judging from the industrial and commercial tax revenue of the People's Government, the expected completion number in 1951 will exceed the highest level in history. The total tax revenue in 1951 will reach 150% of that in 1950, but industry and commerce are continuing to prosper, and industrial and commercial people are profitable. The movement to donate airplanes and cannons to resist US aggression and aid Korea has achieved remarkable results, which is evidence of the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, it can be asserted that the recovery of my country's trade in 1951 is close to the level in history.

In summary, industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation in our country have all been rapidly restored in the past two years, but the recovery work needs to be continued.

III. Improvement of Labor Enthusiasm and Preliminary Improvement of Living Standards of the Working People

The working class and the peasant class have stood up and become the masters of the new China, and therefore the labor enthusiasm of workers and peasants has been unprecedentedly improved, which has become the driving force for the rapid recovery of our country's economy in the past two years.

In the industrial and transportation sectors, state-owned industrial and transportation enterprises have generally carried out democratic reform work, abolished the system that oppressed workers that existed in industrial and mining enterprises for a long time—such as the foreman system, body search system, and beating and detention of workers—and replaced it with a democratic management system; thousands of worker activists have been promoted to participate in the leadership of grassroots enterprises; trade unions and factory management committees have been generally established, and a planning management system for grassroots enterprises has been initially established; a labor insurance system has been initially implemented and wages have been adjusted. Therefore, the labor enthusiasm of the working class has been greatly improved, production competitions and rationalization proposals have been widely carried out in various factories and mines, labor productivity has been increasing year by year (for example, the average daily coal mining volume per capita in the coal mining industry was generally 0.33 tons during the Kuomintang government, 0.404 tons in 1949, 0.459 tons in 1950, and 0.62 tons in 1951), production technology has also been continuously improved, and many labor models have emerged in various enterprises.

In the private industrial and mining enterprises, due to the implementation of the "both labor and capital benefit" policy, and the use of labor-capital consultation meetings to negotiate and handle labor-capital dispute matters, many specific problems have been solved; therefore, the management system of private industrial and mining enterprises has also been reformed, and production has also been greatly improved.

In agriculture, after land reform, the production enthusiasm of peasants has been unprecedentedly improved. The number of plowing and weeding and the amount of fertilization have increased every year; in the struggle against nature, the great power of peasants has been further demonstrated: in water conservancy work, more than 419 million cubic meters of earthwork was completed in 1950, and this number will far exceed this number in 1951. Millions of peasants participated in the river management, canal construction, and levee protection projects. The great Huai River management project has enabled the Huai River basin to be free from flooding this year. In 1950, the country added more than 7.7 million mu of water land. In 1951, another 12.3 million mu were added. In the work of killing locusts and insects, in 1950, the area of land treated for insects reached more than 88 million mu, and in 1951, it reached more than 97 million mu. Millions of peasants carried out a vigorous locust killing movement, so that agriculture was spared from locust disasters this year. In the drought resistance struggle, in 1951, more than 30 million mu of cotton were planted by carrying water, and more than 2.9 million mu of forests were planted. All these have become important conditions for the rapid recovery of agricultural production in our country. The emergence of agricultural labor models in various places will lead peasants to continue to improve their labor enthusiasm.

Due to the rapid recovery of production, the material living standards of the working people in our country have generally been improved. This is first reflected in the relative stability of prices since March 1950, basically stopping inflation, guaranteeing the actual wages of salary earners, and appropriately adjusting workers' wages. There has been a different percentage increase in various regions and enterprises across the country; the lives of peasants have been improved more universally. Of course, the lives of public employees, technicians, and employees are still relatively difficult, but the finances of the People's Government are taken from the people and used for the people, and this will improve with the gradual improvement of the country's financial situation. Secondly, due to the recovery and development of economic undertakings and cultural and educational health undertakings, the number of people employed by the state has increased rapidly. People who have labor or knowledge have generally found their occupations. The unemployment situation has been fundamentally changed in the past two years. In June 1950, there were more than 1.66 million unemployed workers, semi-unemployed workers, and unemployed intellectuals across the country. By the end of 1950, there were only more than 610,000 people, and by July 1951, there were only more than 450,000 people left. With the recovery and development of the economy and the development of cultural undertakings, the phenomenon of intellectual panic and worker shortages will soon appear.

In the past two years, the people of our country have experienced many difficulties in the economic recovery work, but the difficulties have been overcome by the great power of the people; at present, our material living conditions are not very good, but they have been improved; they will gradually improve in the future.

IV. The State-Owned Economy Has Maintained Its Leadership, and the Five Economic Components Have Each Found Their Place

The recovery work of China's People's Economy is different from the general meaning of restoring the old look. It is also carrying out reorganization work at the same time, which is to reorganize the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic system into a New Democratic economic system. The imbalance in the recovery and development of various sectors of the people's economy and various regions across the country—some enterprises have recovered quickly, some enterprises have not only recovered but also developed, some enterprises have recovered slowly, some enterprises have been eliminated, some regions have recovered quickly, and some regions have recovered slowly—is the normal law of this economic reorganization. This recovery and reorganization work has achieved great success in the past two years. However, the reorganization has not ended. The greatest achievements of economic reorganization are: the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic situation has been fundamentally changed, and the New Democratic economic system serving the Chinese people has been initially established; the imbalance between various sectors of the people's economy has been initially changed, and the balance between production, sales, raw material supply and its balance with transportation and trade has achieved initial success; commercial speculation, financial speculation, and the pursuit of excessive profits have been greatly changed. These achievements are due to the correct leadership of the state—correct policies and a certain degree of planning, and the unity of various social economic components. However, this reorganization work will naturally continue, and must also continue, so that the New Democratic economic system will become healthier and more perfect.

In industry, because land reform, national defense construction, and national basic construction have created a superior market for industrial products, both state-owned industry, local public industry, and private industry have broad room for development; now the situation in our country is that industrial products are insufficient, and the need for industrial products is growing rapidly. Therefore, the state needs to increase heavy industry and the industry of important daily necessities in a planned way to meet the needs of developing people's purchasing power.

In agriculture, only state-owned farms in the Northeast occupy 1% of the cultivated land in the Northeast, and the national agriculture is basically an individual economy. The state's planning and leadership of agriculture is achieved through persuasion and education of peasants, purchase policies, price policies, and agricultural loan policies. Facts have proved that it is not possible to guarantee the state's high degree of planning by leading the agricultural economy by these methods alone. Therefore, it is very necessary to organize agricultural mutual assistance, agricultural cooperatives, and reclaim arable wasteland to develop state-owned farms in a planned, led, and step-by-step manner.

In transportation, the railway is completely state-owned. In 1950, state-owned sea ships and river ships accounted for 41.2%, and private-owned ships accounted for 58.8%; in 1951, both public and private-owned ships increased, of which state-owned ships accounted for 45.8%, and private-owned ships accounted for 54.2%; the total tonnage of inland wooden boats is equivalent to 23 times the total tonnage of ships. In 1950, state-owned transportation vehicles accounted for 30%; private-owned vehicles accounted for 70%; both public and private-owned vehicles increased slightly in 1951, and the proportion did not change much; the total tonnage of horse-drawn vehicle transportation greatly exceeds the total tonnage of existing automobile transportation. Therefore, it is very important to improve railway transportation capacity, give full play to the existing shipping capacity and automobile transportation capacity, and actively organize and lead the transportation of wooden boats and large vehicles in material exchanges.

In commerce, the national commercial capital is very large. Judging from the total trade volume, in 1950, private commerce accounted for about 84%, state-owned commerce accounted for about 14%, and cooperative commerce accounted for about 2%; in 1951, the national total trade volume expanded by about 40% compared to 1950, of which private commerce accounted for about 78%, state-owned commerce accounted for about 19%, and cooperative commerce accounted for about 3%. Therefore, with the expansion of industrial and agricultural reproduction, the total trade volume of the country has expanded rapidly, and both state-owned, private, and cooperative commerce have room for development; however, judging from the situation in 1951, the development of private commerce is far exceeding the development speed of state-owned commerce in terms of quantity. For example, in the Northeast region, the proportion of state-owned commerce in the total trade volume in 1951 was lower than in 1950. Cooperative commerce has developed significantly in 1951, which is beneficial to the broad masses of people. State-owned commerce has generally achieved initial leadership in the market in the wholesale business of important industrial and agricultural products (grain, cotton yarn, cloth, coal, salt, petroleum, etc.), but it lacks strength or has very little strength in the retail business; although cooperative commerce has a significant increase in the proportion of business operations this year, its strength is still small compared to the increase in the total trade volume. Therefore, in order to adapt to the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, and to ensure the stability of retail prices of important daily necessities under the common development of state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce, and private commerce, it is necessary for cooperative commerce and state-owned commerce to do more retail business. "Guiding social idle capital and commercial capital that is not beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood to invest in industry and other production undertakings" (Article 37 of the Common Program), this work still needs to be actively carried out.

In the financial industry, the currency of the whole country has now been completely unified, which has never happened in Chinese history. The state bank's leadership over the financial market is relatively strong, and it has also united private banks and carried out public-private joint ventures with some private banks. Further serving production in the financial industry, especially serving industrial production, and reducing interest rates step by step are necessary tasks.

In summary, in the past two years, the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, the individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, the private capitalist economy, and the state capitalist economy have all developed. The state-owned economy has taken the leading position, but it still needs to be consolidated.

V. Consolidate the Achievements and Continue to Move Forward

As mentioned above, we have achieved great success on the economic front in the past two years. However, we still lack experience in economic work. Various sectors of the people's economy must consolidate existing achievements. Further improve business, and continue to recover, improve, and expand achievements on the existing basis. In-depth summary of experience, planned training of cadres, and focused investigation of resources, so as to spend less money, do more work, and increase income, so as to accumulate greater strength and more powerfully promote the recovery and development of the economy.

The experience of the past two years proves that we still lack experience in carrying out new and large-scale factory and mine construction, and we have more achievements and experience in the recovery and reorganization of existing factories and mines, and can increase productivity relatively quickly; at present, the equipment utilization rate of industrial and mining enterprises in our country is still not high except for a few sectors. Therefore, in 1952, in terms of industrial and mining enterprises, we should use all means to manage existing enterprises well, implement the planning system and economic accounting system, improve technology, and train ourselves to become experts in managing modernized enterprises, and steadily move forward on the basis of the operation and management of existing factories and mines. In transportation enterprises, as in industry, we must further increase the utilization rate of locomotives and vehicles, increase the number of loaded vehicles, shorten the vehicle turnaround time, strengthen road protection, organize waterways, salvage sunken ships, and maximize the shipping capacity of existing ships.

The experience of the past two years proves that the development speed of increasing the yield per unit area of agriculture, reclaiming wasteland, and increasing livestock is not easy to be fast, because we have not yet greatly changed the threats imposed on us by nature. Therefore, in 1952, we must continue to build water conservancy projects, eliminate insects and pests, improve farming techniques, organize, cooperate and help each other, develop animal husbandry, protect existing forests and plant a large number of forests; we must also seize the opportunity to summarize experience in these tasks.

The experience of the past two years proves that state-owned trade work has developed rapidly, and in-depth rectification work cannot keep up with the needs. Therefore, in 1952, in state-owned trade work, it is necessary to continue to improve operation and management, implement the economic accounting system, accelerate the turnover of funds, and further serve production.

Strengthen the planning of the people's economy, continue to give full play to the enthusiasm of various social economic components, and unite and move forward!

    两年来中国人民经济建设的成就
    宋劭文
    中华人民共和国成立已经两年了。两年来，我们在经济战线上的成就也如在政治上的成就一样，是伟大的。这些成就就是：根本改变了旧中国的半殖民地半封建的经济状况；在新民主主义轨道上迅速恢复着国家经济；初步提高了人民的物质生活，并提高了劳动人民的生产热忱；贯彻了“公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流”的政策。国营经济保持了领导，各种社会经济成分，分工合作，各得其所。这些成就是怎样取得的呢？这就是忠实执行毛主席的指示，忠实执行中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的结果，是“坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人”的政策的结果，是在工人与农民积极劳动之下并与全国人民团结一致共同奋斗的结果。兹将两年来中国人民经济建设的成就概述如下：一、半殖民地半封建的经济状
    况根本改变
    土地改革和清除土匪恶霸是发展生产力与国家工业化的必要条件。清匪反霸，镇压反革命的工作，现在全国大部地区已基本结束；土地改革的工作，已经在百分之七十六的农村人口中完成，即有三亿一千万以上农民，实现了耕者有其田；还有百分之二十四的农村人口中，已经实行了反霸、退押、减租的斗争，除少数民族地区外，今冬明年亦可进行分配土地。因此，封建半封建的土地制度，已经基本改变。地主阶级被打倒了，农民的生产力获得解放。两年来，中国农业的迅速恢复与重要工业品由滞销而迅速变为供不应求，主要是土地改革的直接结果。农民的购买力提高了，贫困状况已有改变；一九五一年纱、布、肥料（主要指豆饼，油饼）、煤炭、钢铁、纯碱及其他重要日用品的销售量，均迅速增加，这就有力地推动了工业的恢复。
    中国的工业现在已经是独立自主的为人民服务的工业，不再是帝国主义与官僚资本主义掠夺人民的工具了。帝国主义在中国的经济特权已基本取消，所有官僚资本已被没收为人民的国家所有，民族资本的工业也站立起来了，这就是工业迅速恢复的另一个条件。无论是重工业、无论是轻工业，在一九五一年，除毛纺织、纸烟、火柴、胶鞋等少数工业部门外，其设备利用率一般均超过中国历史上最高的水平。这就是由于工业的独立自主，由于人民需要大量的工业品，由于对外贸易实行了保护贸易政策及我国与苏联、新民主主义国家的互利的贸易，使得我国各重要生产部门原料供应、成品生产与推销互不衔接的状况，已经起了基本的变化。例如：铁矿砂、生铁、钢锭、钢材的生产已经衔接起来了，积极恢复与增加了钢锭、钢材的产量，适当限制了铁矿砂的产量，初步改变了历史上铁矿砂与生铁大量出口，与钢材大量入口的状况。这就为中国经济的计划化，提供了有利条件。
    长期为帝国主义服务的半殖民地化的海关，两年来，已变为人民自己的海关，完全独立自主了。保护贸易的钥匙掌握在中国人民自己手里，外国轮船航行我国内河的特权也取消了，这就使得新中国的对外贸易状况与旧中国的对外贸易状况发生了根本的改变。首先是我国的对外贸易，基本上摆脱了过去长期对资本主义国家的依赖性，两年来我国的对外贸易最主要的与大量的部分已经是对苏联与新民主主义国家的贸易，对资本主义国家的贸易，已经急激下降了。美英帝国主义对我国的非法禁运，对于我国经济的影响很小，倒是美英帝国主义国家所受影响较大；虽然如此，我们还是愿意继续执行共同纲领第五十七条的规定，“在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系”。其次，在出口方面，人民政府积极组织我国多余的农产品、畜产品、矿产品、手工艺品出口，这就使得一九五○及一九五一年的出口总值均超过一九三一年以前的纪录：如以一九三六年的出口总值为一○○，那时的美金一元作现在的美金二元计，则一九五○年的出口总值为一三四，一九五一年的出口总值将为一六○；日益增加的出口贸易有力地推动了我国农产品、副业产品、矿产品、手工艺品的积极生产。复次，在入口方面，旧中国长期是以棉、麦、大米、麻袋等日用品及纸烟等奢侈品占极大的比重，在一九五一年我国粮食及农产品的工业原料，除橡胶外，已经根本解决，或初步得到解决，五金器材、机器、仪器的入口比重有很大的增加。这正反映了我国工农业迅速恢复的状况。随着我国工农业生产的继续恢复与发展，则机器的入口比重必将与年俱增，而生活资料与一般工业器材的入口亦将随之下降。这就说明：随着人民革命的胜利，海关自主，保护贸易，土地改革为我国的工业化扫清了道路。
    半殖民地半封建的经济状况——农村的破产，工业的萎靡，一去不复返了。新民主主义的人民经济，——工业的恢复与发展，农村的恢复与繁荣，两年来，在劳动人民积极工作之下，已经获得很大的成就。二、人民经济恢复的成果
    我国人民经济的恢复工作是迅速的。以一九五一年重要工农业产品的预计产量与中国历史上同类产品的最高年产量相比，则一九五一年的重要工农业产品的产量，除生铁、煤、小麦、大豆等主要工农业产品外，多与历史上的最高生产水平相接近，大部分较次要的产品且超过。在交通运输方面，则铁路已基本上恢复；航运则因国民党反动政府劫掠破坏惨重，恢复较慢；公路全国主要干线已恢复，运量亦增加不少。贸易的恢复与生产的恢复相适应。兹将两年来人民经济各主要部门恢复的状况，略述如下：
    工业的恢复状况。以历史上最高年产量为一○○
    （关内一般采取一九三六年的数字，东北一般采取一九四三年的数字），重要工业品一九五○年及一九五一年恢复状况，如下表：历史上最高年产量    一九五○年产量    一九五一年预计产量生铁  
  一○○    四八·五    六四·○钢锭    一○○    六八·五  
  九七·○钢材    一○○    六七·○    一二○·○煤    一○○    五八·六    六九·二电力    一○○    七七·五    九四·五水泥    一○○    六五·七    一○七·○铜    一○○    二五三·○    三三三·○钨    一○○    七六·○    八○·○锡    一○○    三八·一    四六·○玻璃    一○○    一一九·五    一三八·○烧碱    一○○    八二·一    二四四·○纯碱    一○○    九七·一    一二四·○棉纱    一○○    一○○·三    一○五·九棉布    一○○    一○八·七    一一三·五麻袋    一○○    四三·四    九八·五纸张    一○○    一一四·五    一五五·○轮胎    一○○    六六·○    一九六·○
    从上表看出：生铁、煤、锡三项，一五九一年预计产量较历史上最高年产量距离最大。铁与煤的最高年产量均系日本帝国主义盗窃我国财富最凶恶的一年（一九四二年）的产量，其中有很大数量运往日本。锡的最高年产量，在历史上也只有一年（一九三八年），前后各年均相差甚远。钢锭、电力、钨、麻袋等项的一九五一年预计产量，均接近历史上最高年产量；其中电力设备，则尚有不少数量未恢复，但因现有设备出力增加，故产量已接近过去最高水平。其他项目则均超过。两年来我国工业设备能力增加不多，有若干产品的产量增加不少，这是因为职工劳动生产率的提高与设备利用率的提高的结果。
    农业的恢复状况。以历史上最高年产量为一○○
    （一般采取一九三六年或一九三七年的数字），重要农业品一九五○年及一九五一年恢复状况，如下表：
        历史上最高年产量    一九五○年产量    一九五一年预计产量粮食    一○○    八七·○    九二·八其中：稻谷一○○  
  九六·五    九九·四
        小麦一○○    八○·四    八八·五
        大豆一○○    五八·九    六三·三棉花    一○○    八三·七    一三三·○油料作物（不包括大豆）    一○○    四四·○    六五·九烤菸    一○○    二四·一    一三○·五麻袋用麻    一○○    一一四·七    二二七·一
    从上表看出：一九五一年的粮食产量已接近历史上最高年产量，但大豆产量则尚低。工业原料作物，棉花、烤菸、麻，均已超过历史上最高产年量。但油料作物仅及过去最高产量的三分之二，茶叶、蚕丝、甘蔗的产量，约当历史上最高年产量的四分之一至三分之一。甜菜的生产则已超过过去的最高水平。这里表明，我国的粮食已改变过去大量依靠入口的状态，但国家存储尚不充足，还应予以密切注意，随着轻工业的恢复与发展，农产品工业原料的需要日益巨大，但在中国条件下，这个问题的解决，还不十分困难。蚕丝、茶叶还须积极恢复生产，甜菜的生产还须增加。牧畜方面，牛、羊、猪在历史上的最高所有量，数字较低，恐统计不全；按目前牛、羊、猪全国所有数量，牛与猪可能恢复到过去的百分之八十左右，羊的恢复约及过去的二分之一左右。因此，恢复与发展畜牧事业，今后还需要大力推动。
    农业的迅速恢复，除土地改革为主要条件外，还有向自然的斗争与组织起来的力量。前者最重要的工作是水利建设，变水害为水利，灭蝗除虫，战胜虫害；后者最重要的工作是组织变工互助，农业合作，提高技术，改良品种。
    交通运输的恢复与工农业的恢复相适应，两年来在“城乡互助，内外交流”的工作上，克服了若干困难，交通运输工作胜利地完成了任务。铁路、航运、公路的运输量两年来均增加很快。在铁路运输方面，因为目前我国的国内贸易仍以南北交流为主，出入口贸易现在亦以陆运为主，这就大大地加重了铁路运输的任务。历史上一年的总运量究有若干，因未获得完全的记载，两年来恢复状况，不好与之相比；但从一九五一年商品生产总量与主要铁路每日行车数来看，则一九五一年铁路运输总量可超过历史上的最高水平，比起一九五○年，则增加百分之三三·二。在航运方面，解放前，沿海航线与内河航线基本上为外轮占有，如以一九三六年为例，沿海航线本国的轮船只有三十三万余吨，而这时国境内的外轮则有一百二十万吨，此外尚有经常出入我国港口的外轮约四百万吨，全年运量共为四千四百九十余万吨。解放后，为蒋介石匪帮劫后遗留的船只，海轮与江轮合计，仅二十六万余吨，但从此即开始了我国独立自主的航运事业。在运量方面，一九五○年运量不高，一九五一年比一九五○年增加百分之七十五。在公路运输方面，全国公路干线已完全恢复，并新修若干线路，货运方面，如以一九四一年的运量为一○○，则一九五○年为百分之六十五，一九五一年为百分之一一八·七。此外，木船与兽力车的恢复是很迅速的，但木船的运输不能作远程的大量货载；因此，积极恢复我国航线，并充分发挥现有轮船的运输力是很重要的。
    贸易的恢复与发展，是两年来人民经济迅速恢复的关键之一。我国工农业主要生产部门虽尚未恢复到历史上最高生产水平，但由于人民政府大力组织了土产交流与建筑工业的空前发展，使人民经济的商品生产总值有了迅速的增加，因而增加了总贸易额。从人民政府的工商业税收状况来看，一九五一年的预计完成数，将超过历史上最高的水平，一九五一年的税收总额，将达一九五○年的百分之一百五十，可是工商业在继续繁荣着，工商业者均有利可图，抗美援朝捐献飞机大炮的运动，获得显著的成绩，就是工商业发展的一个证据。因此，一九五一年我国贸易的恢复，已接近历史上的水平，是可断言的。
    综上各节，我国工农商业及交通运输业，两年来均得到迅速的恢复，但恢复工作还待继续。三、劳动人民生产热忱的提高
    与生活的初步改善
    工人阶级与农民阶级站立起来了，成为新中国的主人，因而工农的劳动积极性是空前提高了，这就成为两年来我国经济迅速恢复的动力。
    在工业和交通事业方面，国营工业与交通企业，一般都已进行了民主改革工作，废除了工矿企业中过去长期存在的压迫工人的制度——如把头制度、搜身制度、打骂拘押工人等，代之以民主管理的制度；成千地提拔了工人积极分子参加了基层企业的领导工作；普遍建立了职工会与工厂管理委员会，并初步建立了基层企业的计划管理制度；初步实行了劳动保险制度并调整了工资。因此，工人阶级的劳动积极性大为提高，生产竞赛与合理化建议在各厂矿普遍开展，劳动生产率逐年在提高着（例如：煤矿工业全员平均每日挖煤量，在国民党政府时期，一般为○·三三吨，一九四九年为○·四○四吨，一九五○年为○·四五九吨，一九五一年为○·六二吨），生产技术亦有不断改进，在各企业中并涌现了不少的劳动模范。
    在私营工矿企业方面，由于实行了“劳资两利”政策，并用劳资协商会议的形式，协商处理劳资争议事项，解决了很多具体问题；因而使私营工矿企业的管理制度亦有所改革，生产亦有很大改进。
    在农业方面，土地改革之后，农民的生产积极性是空前提高了。耕锄次数与施肥量每年均有增加；在与自然斗争方面，更显示了农民的伟大力量：在水利工作上，一九五○年完成了四亿一千九百多万立方公尺的土方，一九五一年还要远超过此数，以百万计的农民参加了治河、修渠、护堤的工程，伟大的治淮工程，今年已使淮河流域获得免于水患的效果。一九五○年全国增加水地七百七十余万亩。一九五一年又增加一千二百三十万亩。在灭蝗除虫的工作上，在一九五○年除虫土地面积达八千八百余万亩，在一九五一年达九千七百余万亩，数百万农民进行了轰轰烈烈的灭蝗运动，使今年农业上免于蝗灾。在抗旱斗争中，一九五一年担水点种棉花三千余万亩，造林二百九十余万亩。所有这些，都成为我国农业生产迅速恢复的重要条件。农业劳动模范的在各地产生，将会带领农民继续提高劳动积极性。
    由于生产的迅速恢复，我国劳动人民的物质生活水平，一般是提高了。这首先表现在从一九五○年三月以来的物价相对稳定，基本上停止了通货膨胀，保证了薪资所得者的实际工资，并适当调整了工人工资，全国各地区各企业并有不同比例的增加；农民的生活比较普遍地得到改善。当然公教人员、技术人员与职工的生活还是比较艰苦的，但是人民政府的财政是取之于民，用之于民的，这是会随着国家财政状况的逐渐改善而改善的。其次，由于经济事业、文教卫生事业的恢复与发展，国家用人的数量迅速增加了，凡是有劳动力或有知识的人，一般都已找到他的职业，两年来失业状况已有根本的改变。一九五○年六月全国失业工人、半失业工人、失业知识分子共有一百六十六万余人，至一九五○年底只有六十一万余人，至一九五一年七月则仅余四十五万余人了。随着经济的恢复发展及文化事业的发展，知识分子恐慌与工人不足的现象，很快就会出现。
    两年来，我国人民在经济的恢复工作中是经历过很多困难的，但困难均被人民的伟大力量所战胜；目前我们的物质生活状况还不很好，但已有所改善；今后还逐渐会有所改善。四、国营经济保持了领导，五
    种经济成分各得其所
    中国人民经济的恢复工作，不同于一般意义的恢复旧观，而是同时进行着改组工作，就是把半殖民地半封建的经济体系改组为新民主主义的经济体系。人民经济各部门，全国各地区，恢复与发展的不平衡——有的企业恢复快，有的企业不但恢复了而且发展了，有的企业恢复慢，有的企业被淘汰了，有的地区恢复快，有的地区恢复慢，正是这种经济改组的正常规律。这一恢复和改组的工作，两年来获得很大的成就。但是改组还未结束。经济改组工作的最大成就就是：半殖民地半封建的经济状况根本改变，为中国人民服务的新民主主义经济体系初步建立；人民经济各部门之间的不平衡状况初步改变、生产、销售、原材料供应的平衡及其与交通运输、贸易之间的平衡，已经取得初步的成绩；商业投机、金融投机、追逐暴利的行为，已经有极大的改变。这些成就，是靠了国家的正确领导——正确的政策与一定的计划性，及各种社会经济成分的团结造成的。但是这一改组工作自然还会继续，同时也必须继续，以使新民主主义的经济体系日臻健康与完善。
    在工业方面，由于土地改革、国防建设、国家的基本建设，为工业产品创造了优越的市场，无论国营工业、地方公营工业、私营工业、均有广阔的发展余地；现在我国的情况是工业品不足，而工业品的需要则是迅速增长着。因此，国家需要有计划地增加重工业与重要日用品的工业，以满足发展着的人民购买力的需要。
    在农业方面，只有在东北国营农场的耕地占了东北耕地的百分之一，全国农业基本上是个体经济。国家对于农业的计划与领导，是经过对农民的说服教育，收购政策，价格政策，农贷政策等来实现的。事实证明，只靠这些方法领导农业经济，是不能保证国家的高度计划性的。因此有计划、有领导、有步骤地组织农业互助，农业合作社与有步骤有计划地开垦宜农的荒地发展国营农场是很必要的。
    在交通运输方面，铁路完全是国营的。航运一九五○年海轮与江轮国营的占百分之四一·二，私营的占百分之五八·八；在一九五一年公私营均有增加，其中国营的占百分之四五·八，私营的占百分之五四·二；内河木船的总吨位，相当于轮船总吨位的二十三倍。运输汽车一九五○年国营的占百分之三○；私营的占百分之七○；在一九五一年公私营均略有增加，比例无大变化；马车运输的总吨位则超过现有汽车运输总吨位很大。因此提高铁路运输能力发挥现有的航运能力与汽车运输能力，并积极组织领导木船大车的运输，是物资交流中很重要的工作。
    在商业方面，全国商业资本是很庞大的。从总贸易额来看，一九五○年，私营商业约占百分之八四，国营商业约占百分之一四，合作社商业约占百分之二；一九五一年全国总贸易额比一九五○年约扩大百分之四○，其中私营商业约占百分之七八，国营商业约占百分之一九，合作社商业约占百分之三。因此，随着工农业再生产的扩大，国家总贸易额迅速扩大，无论国营、私营、合作社商业，均有发展的余地；但从一九五一年的状况来看，私营商业的发展，在量的方面则远超过国营商业的发展速度，如在东北地区一九五一年国营商业在总贸易额中所占比例，反较一九五○年降低了。一九五一年合作社商业有较大的发展，这对广大人民是有利的。国营商业在重要工农业产品（粮食、花纱布、煤、盐、石油等）的批发业务上，一般已取得对市场的初步领导地位，但在零售业务上，则是缺乏力量的或者说力量很微小；合作社商业今年在经营比例上虽有显著增加，但比起总贸易额的增加，力量仍然是微小的。因此适应工农业生产的恢复与发展，在国营商业、合作社商业、私营商业共同发展的条件下，为保证重要日用品零售价格的稳定，合作社商业与国营商业多做一些零售业务是必要的。“引导社会游资及无益于国计民生的商业资本投入工业及其他生产事业”（共同纲领第三十七条），这一工作还需要积极进行。
    在金融业方面，现在全国的货币已经完全统一了，这是中国历史上从来不曾有过的。国家银行对于金融市场的领导是比较坚强的，并且也团结了私营银行，与若干私营银行进行了公私合营。金融业进一步为生产服务，特别是为工业生产服务，有步骤地降低利率，这是必须进行的工作。
    综上各节，两年来国营经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济、私人资本主义经济和国家资本主义经济均有发展，国营经济已经取得领导地位，但尚须巩固。五、巩固已得成绩继续前进
    如上所述，两年来我们在经济战线上获得很大的成绩。但是我们在经济工作上还是缺乏经验的。人民经济各部门，必须巩固现有的成绩。进一步改善业务，在现有基础上继续恢复、改进、扩大成绩地。深入总结经验，有计划地培养干部，有重点调查资源，做到花钱少，办事多，收入大，以积蓄更大的力量，更有力地推动经济的恢复发展工作。
    两年来的经验证明：我们在进行新的较大的厂矿建设上还是十分缺乏经验的，对于现有厂矿的恢复改组工作是比较有成绩有经验、并且能比较迅速地增加生产力的；现在我国的工矿企业，除少数部门外，其设备利用率还是不高的。因此，在一九五二年在工矿企业方面，我们应该用一切办法管好现有企业，贯彻计划制度与经济核算制，提高技术，使我们自己锻炼成为管理近代化企业的内行，在现有厂矿经营管理的基础上，稳步前进。在交通运输企业上，也如在工业上一样，要进一步发挥机车车辆的利用率，增加装车数，缩短车辆周转时间，加强护路，整理航道，打捞沉船，发挥现有轮船的航运能力。
    两年来的经验证明：提高农业单位面积的产量、开垦荒地、增加牲畜，这些工作的发展速度是不容易快的，因为目前我们对于自然加于我们的威胁还没有很大的改变。因此，在一九五二年，必须继续兴修水利，除虫除害，提高耕作技术，组织起来，合作互助，发展牧畜，保护现有森林并大量造林；在这些工作上并须抓紧总结经验。
    两年来的经验证明：国营贸易工作开展速度较快，深入整理工作赶不上需要。因此，一九五二年，在国营贸易工作上，需要继续改善经营管理工作，贯彻经济核算制，加速资金周转速度，并进一步为生产服务。
    加强人民经济的计划性，继续发挥各社会经济成分的积极性，团结前进！
