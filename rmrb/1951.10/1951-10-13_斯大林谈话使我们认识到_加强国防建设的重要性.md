    Stalin's Speech Made Us Realize the Importance of Strengthening National Defense Construction

To the Editor:

    The students were very excited after reading Stalin's speech on the atomic weapons issue. At lunchtime on the 7th, the full text of Comrade Stalin's speech was broadcast on the radio. When the broadcaster read that the Soviet Union "tested a type of atomic bomb" and "will continue to conduct tests on atomic bombs of various diameters," the dining hall immediately erupted in applause. The students engaged in extensive discussions in the afternoon and evening. Some students even held discussion groups. Everyone felt that Comrade Stalin's speech was another great blow to American imperialism. America's last trump card was the atomic bomb, but now this trump card has completely failed. Fourth-year students in the Department of Electrical Engineering stated: Because of this speech, the people are even more confident in carrying out the struggle for peace. The United States used to be able to use the atomic bomb to scare people with nervous breakdowns, but now it can't even scare people with nervous breakdowns.

    Many students also said: This makes it possible to ban the use of atomic weapons, and the movement to fight for peace will greatly develop. This is truly good news for world peace. Li Mouheng, a third-year student in the Department of Civil Engineering, said: Stalin's speech made me more aware of the importance of strengthening national defense. Only if we have a strong and modern national defense force can we prevent imperialism from daring to invade our country.

### 斯大林谈话使我们认识到  加强国防建设的重要性

    斯大林谈话使我们认识到
    加强国防建设的重要性编辑同志：
    同学们看了斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话后，都很兴奋。七日午饭时，广播器里广播了斯大林同志谈话的全文。当广播的人念到苏联“试验了一种类型的原子弹”“将来还要进行各种不同直径的原子弹的试验”时，饭厅里立刻响起了一片掌声。同学们在下午和晚上展开了漫谈。有的同学还举行了座谈会。大家都觉得：斯大林同志的谈话，对美国帝国主义又是一个极大的打击。美国最后一张王牌是原子弹，但是现在这张王牌已经彻底破产了。电机系四年级的同学们表示：因为这一谈话，人民进行和平斗争更是充满了信心，美国原来还能以原子弹吓吓神经衰弱的人，现在连神经衰弱的人也吓不倒了。
    许多同学还说：这一来禁止使用原子武器有了可能性，争取和平的运动也将大大发展，这真是世界人民的和平福音。土木系三年级李谋恒同学说：斯大林的谈话使我更体会到加强国防的重要。只有我们有了强大的现代化的国防力量，才能使帝国主义不敢侵犯我们的国家。
