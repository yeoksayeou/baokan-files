Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th: Our front-line reporter reports: After the disastrous defeat of the American aggressor army’s "Autumn Offensive" on the western front, they risked advancing into the eastern part of the central front. The aggressor army invested in the eastern part of the central front included the US 24th Division, the 7th Division, the Li Syngman puppet army's 2nd Division, the 6th Division, and accomplice troops from Colombia, the Netherlands, and other units, totaling more than four divisions. The aggressor army's infantry, coordinated with a large number of aircraft and tanks, relentlessly pounced on us day and night, but were met with head-on blows on every inch of land. In just three days, from the 13th to the 15th, our soldiers killed and wounded as many as 17,000 enemy troops on a narrow stretch of more than 20 kilometers, an average of nearly 6,000 enemy troops killed and wounded per day. On this battlefield, enemy corpses were almost everywhere.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The "Autumn Offensive" launched by the American aggressors while delaying and obstructing the armistice negotiations is paying a heavy price. The following is a message from the Associated Press reporter on the 16th from the western Korean front. This message describes the heavy casualties suffered by the US "old guard" 7th Cavalry Regiment in the western front.

The message said: "In the ten days of attacking battles, the casualties of the 7th Cavalry Regiment were equal to the casualties of the previous six months of battles.

A young sergeant said: 'If they want us to go out again, we can't answer the call.'

A company commander, wounded by shrapnel and still wearing bandages, looked sadly at his notebook, seeing how many men were left in his platoons—one platoon had twenty-one men left, another platoon had nineteen men left, and the third platoon had twenty-two men left.

This serious situation is almost the same in every platoon of the 7th Cavalry Regiment."

The message said: "This regiment only advanced five miles from October 3rd to October 12th. At that time, only half of the frontline infantry of the first, second, and third battalions were left. One company had only thirteen infantrymen left. Only one officer was left. Two company commanders in this unit were injured and died within a few days.

These casualties were partly caused by mortars and artillery, or by huge Chinese hand grenades the size of small watermelons."

The reporter quoted a machine gunner named Daniel as saying: "When we went out, my squad had twelve people, and after the battle, there were only four of us left, including me." Another soldier, Ward, said: "Our squad had seven people when the battle started. Now I am with the machine gun, and there is no second squad anymore. Only the two of us."

Another Associated Press message said: The remnants of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment totaled only more than 500 people. One company had no officers at all—all three platoon leaders and two company commanders were either wounded or killed. Only two platoon leaders were left in the Able, Baker, and Charlie infantry companies.

    朝鲜中线东部二十余公里狭窄地段上
    我军三天歼敌一万七千
    美联社记者供认在朝鲜西线美骑兵第七团伤亡惨重
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略军“秋季攻势”在西线遭到惨败后，又向中线偏东地区冒险进犯。此次侵略军投入中线偏东地区的兵力有美军第二十四师、第七师、李伪军第二师、第六师及帮凶军哥伦比亚、荷兰等部队共四个师以上。侵略军步兵在大量飞机、坦克的配合下，昼夜不停地向我猛扑，但在每一寸土地上都遭到迎头痛击。仅十三日至十五日的三天中，我军战士们即在二十余公里的狭窄地段上，杀伤敌军达一万七千名，平均每天杀伤敌军近六千名。在这个战场上，几乎遍地摆满了敌军尸体。 【新华社十八日讯】美国侵略者在拖延阻挠停战谈判期间所发动的“秋季攻势”，正在付出惨重的代价。下面是美联社记者十六日发自朝鲜西线的一条消息。这条消息叙述了美国的“老牌”骑兵第七团在西线作战中遭受惨重伤亡的情形。
    消息说：“在十天来的攻击战斗中，骑兵第七团的伤亡等于以往六个月战斗的伤亡。
    一个年青的中士说：‘假如他们还要我们再次出动，我们是无法应命的。’
    一个被弹片所伤而仍然打着绷带的连长愁眉苦脸地看着他的笔记本，看他手下的几个排还剩下多少人——一个排剩下二十一人，另一个排剩下十九人，第三个排剩下二十二个人。
    这种严重的情形，几乎在骑兵第七团的每一个排里都是这样。”
    消息说：“这个团从十月三日到十二日，只推进了五英里。当时，第一、第二和第三营的前线步兵都只剩下了半数。有一个连只剩下十三名步兵。军官只剩下一名。这个部队有两名连长受伤，不到几天就死去了。
    这些伤亡，部分是由迫击炮和大炮、或者是由像小西瓜那么大小的中国巨型手榴弹所造成的。”
    记者引一个名叫达尼尔的机枪手的话说：“我们出击时，我的一班有十二个人，战斗结束以后，连我在内只剩下四个人。”另一个士兵华德说：“我们班开始作战时有七个人。我现在和机关枪在一道，再没有任何第二班了。只有我们俩。”
    美联社的另一条消息说：第七骑兵团第一营的残兵一共只有五百多人。某连一个官长也没有——三个排长和两个连长全都伤亡了。在阿倍尔、贝克和查理三个步兵连里只剩下两个排长。
