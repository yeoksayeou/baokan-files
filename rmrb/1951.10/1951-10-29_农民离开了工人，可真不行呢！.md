    "Farmers Can't Do Without Workers!"
    Chen Jin, Female Agricultural Labor Model of Pingyuan Province
    I am the head of the reading group in our village. I often see phrases like "Workers and farmers are one family," "Workers are the elder brothers," and "Workers lead farmers" in the newspaper. Sometimes I hear the same thing on the radio when I attend meetings in the county. Every time, I feel a bit bothered and can't figure it out. I think, workers spend all day working in the city, they don't even understand farming, how can we let them come to the countryside and lead us farmers, wouldn't they lead us down the wrong path! Someone said that workers can manufacture machines, and I said, aren't these fancy machines all made by foreigners anyway! After I visited the North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin this time, I realized that my views were completely wrong. As soon as I got on the train, I received warm care from the worker brothers, and they treated farmers like family. Later, I visited the exhibition hall and participated in the worker-peasant get-together, which was truly moving. At the get-together, several worker brothers surrounded me, asking about my life, offering cigarettes and candies, just as close as brothers and sisters. From our conversations, I learned that they are thinking every day about producing useful things for farmers. I understand now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, "workers and farmers are truly one family."
    In the exhibition hall, I saw many new farm tools. There were weeding hoes, walking plows, slicers, cotton seeders, and also waterwheels. When I asked, I found out that they were all made by the worker elder brothers themselves. I took a fancy to two things: one was the weeding hoe, it can be adjusted to be narrow or wide, and it is very light and handy. Pulled by livestock, it can weed thirty or forty mu of land a day. At home, I lead the women in our village to weed, and even if we work hard, we can only weed two or three mu of land per person per day. I want to buy a weeding hoe to take back. The other thing is the small waterwheel, which is very light and ingenious, and can be pushed by one person. Not to mention being pulled by livestock, even if it's pushed by people, it can irrigate three or four mu of land a day. At home, we use windlasses to draw water, and even the most capable people can only irrigate a little more than one mu of land a day, and we are exhausted with aching backs and legs. If it weren't for the worker elder brothers inventing these new farm tools, the production of farmers would never improve in hundreds of lifetimes. I finally understand what "workers lead farmers" means.

    “农民离开了工人，可真不行呢！”
    平原省妇女农业劳动模范  陈金
    我是村上的读报组组长。看到报上常说“工人农民是一家”“工人是老大哥”，“工人领导农民”等话。有时在县里开会听广播也这么说。我每回总是闷得慌，想不通。我想，工人整天在城里做工，又不懂庄稼活，叫他下农村领导农民，还不领到岔地里去呀！有人说工人会制造机器，我说机器这洋玩艺，还不都是外国人造的呀！这回我在天津参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会以后，才知道我的看法全不对。我一上火车就受到工人兄弟的热烈照顾，工人把农民看成一家人。后来我参观了展览馆，又参加了工农联欢大会，真受感动。在联欢会上，几个工人兄弟围着我，问长问短，敬烟敬糖，真亲密的像兄弟姊妹一样。从谈话里边，我才知道他们天天想法给农民生产有用的东西。我明白了，在共产党人民政府领导下，“工人农民真是一家”。
    在展览馆里，我看到很多新农具。有耘锄、步犁、切片机、棉花播种机，还有水车。一问都是工人老大哥自己造的。我看上了两样东西：一样是耘锄，它能窄能宽，很轻便，用牲口拉着一天能锄三、四十亩地，我在家领着俺们妇女锄地，紧赶慢赶，一人一天才锄二、三亩地。我要买个耘锄回去。再一样是小水车，造的很轻巧，一个人就能推动了。别说用牲口拉，就是人推，一天也浇三、四亩地。我们在家绞辘轳，怪能干的人，一天也才浇一亩多地，还累得腰痛腿酸。要不是工人老大哥创造了这些新农具，农民的生产几百辈子也提不高。“工人领导农民”我算想通了。
