    Dedicate the Best Work Achievements to the Great Motherland
    Present the Translated "Selected Works of Michurin" to Chairman Mao

    Respected Chairman Mao:
    We are a group of agricultural science workers who suffered torment and poisoning under the reactionary rule. We were also adversely affected by the Mendelian-Morgan formalistic genetics in natural science theory. Therefore, we had few achievements in agricultural scientific research. You have opened up a new path for the Chinese people, giving us the opportunity to relearn, and making us clearly realize why agricultural science could not achieve success in old China, and why it could only be a decoration for the ruling class, detached from reality.

    Therefore, we are determined to translate the "Selected Works of Michurin"—this immortal work of the great nature transformer—as the basis for agricultural science workers to study new theories. More than twenty people participated in the translation work, which lasted half a year. It was revised several times before the final draft was finalized and sent to press.

    Following this book, we collaborated with the Northeast Agricultural College to translate the "Proceedings of the 1948 Session of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences." This is a victorious summary of Michurin's theory in the Soviet Union for more than twenty years. It finally cleared up the remaining poison of Mendelian-Morgan thought, and therefore it shocked the world's natural science community and greatly influenced China's natural science community.

    We have a preliminary understanding of the brilliant achievements of Michurin and his successor, Academician Lysenko, and we can clearly see the development prospects of our country's agricultural science work; because we know that the great Mao Zedong era has created all the possible conditions for the development of our country's cause, opening up infinitely bright prospects.
    All staff of the North China Agricultural Science Institute

    Editor's Note: The twenty-odd scientific workers of the North China Agricultural Science Institute began translating the "Selected Works of Michurin," which contains more than 400,000 words, in January of last year. After half a year of translation, collation, and review, and another year of typesetting and printing by the People's Publishing House, it was published on the eve of this year's National Day. All the staff of the institute dedicated this book to Chairman Mao as a National Day gift.

### 把最好的工作成果献给伟大的祖国  把译好的“米丘林选集”献给毛主席

    把最好的工作成果献给伟大的祖国
    把译好的“米丘林选集”献给毛主席敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是一群农业科学工作者，我们在反动统治时代，受尽了折磨和毒害，在自然科学理论上，亦受到孟德尔—摩尔根形式主义遗传学的恶劣影响，因此，我们在农业科学的研究工作上就很少成就。您给中国人民开辟了新的道路，使我们有机会重新学习，使我们明确地认识到：为什么农业科学在旧中国不会有成就，为什么它只能永远是脱离实际的统治阶级的装饰品。
    于是我们决心译出“米丘林选集”——这本伟大自然改造者的不朽著作，作为农业科学工作者学习新理论的根据。参加翻译工作的有二十余人，历时半年，其间几经修订，始定稿付梓。
    继本书之后，我们又与东北农学院合作译出了“全苏列宁农业科学院一九四八年会议记录”，这是米丘林学说在苏联二十余年来的胜利总结，它最后澄清了孟德尔—摩尔根的思想余毒，因而它震动了全世界的自然科学界，也大大地影响了中国的自然科学界。
    我们初步认识了米丘林和他的继承者李森科院士的辉煌成就，也就清楚地看见了我们祖国农业科学工作的发展前途；因为我们知道，伟大的毛泽东时代为我们祖国事业的发展，创造了一切的可能条件，开辟了无限的光辉远景。华北农业科学研究所全体工作人员
    编者按：华北农业科学研究所二十几位科学工作者，自去年一月开始翻译四十多万字的“米丘林选集”，经过了半年的翻译、校订和审查工作，又经过人民出版社一年的制版及印刷，已于今年国庆前夕出版。该所全体职工把这本书献给了毛主席，作为国庆献礼。
