To the Editor:
    All employees of the Research Institute of the Preparatory Group of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry have successfully created an aerating agent after more than a year of painstaking experimentation and effort. Aerating agent is a chemical preparation. Aerated cement and aerated concrete made with aerating agent are much more effective than ordinary cement and ordinary concrete, and their durability is greatly increased, with the ability to resist various damaging forces, especially in cold regions. Therefore, it can extend the life of buildings four to eight times. The main reason the institute was able to achieve success in this experimental work was that its employees demonstrated a high degree of creativity. For example, engineers and workers worked continuously for three days and nights without sleep to complete two hundred freeze-thaw cycles of testing. After a series of tests, it was proven that the quality of domestically produced aerating agent has exceeded that of imported "Vinsol" aerating agent.

    中央重工业部基本建设局筹备组研究所职工试制加气剂成功编辑同志：
    中央重工业部基本建设局筹备组研究所全体职工，经过一年多的苦心试验和努力，创制加气剂成功。加气剂是一种化学制剂。用加气剂制成的加气水泥和加气混凝土，较普通水泥和普通混凝土功效要大得多，耐久性也大大增加，有抵抗各种损坏力量的能力，尤其在寒冷地区功效更大。因此，它可延长建筑物的寿命四倍到八倍。该所在这次试验工作中，所以能获得成就，主要是该所职工发挥了高度的创造精神。比如工程师和工人曾连续三昼夜不眠不休，完成了二百次冻融循环的试验。经过一系列的试验证明，国产加气剂的质量已超过外货文沙加气剂。
