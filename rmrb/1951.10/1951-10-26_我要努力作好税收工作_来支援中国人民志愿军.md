    I Will Work Hard at Tax Collection to Support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    To the Editor:
    I am a tax worker who has been emancipated. In the old society, I suffered all kinds of pain and humiliation. I still remember when the Japanese devils occupied Shanghai in 1939, we had to risk our lives to cross the blockade line to transport rice in order to survive. Once, when I and more than fifty companions were passing through the blockade line, six of them were shot dead on the spot. I and more than thirty other male and female companions were captured. After being severely beaten, we were forced by the Japanese devils to strip naked and jump into the river for a "cold bath" in the freezing weather. What is even more infuriating is that the Japanese devils raped all our female companions. The brutal behavior of the Japanese devils towards us is something I will never forget. However, today the bloodstained hands of the Japanese invaders have not yet dried, and American imperialism is rearming them in preparation for invading our country again. This is something the Chinese people can never allow!
    Since Chairman Mao led us to liberation, I have had the opportunity to find work in Zhengzhou. My comrades also elected me as the chairman of the trade union and a representative of the district people's government. In order to work hard and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in defeating American imperialism in Korea as soon as possible, I have vigorously helped industrialists and businessmen in tax collection to dispel their worries, change their business methods, and increase their income, so as to increase the country's tax revenue. Because we absorbed the successful experience of democratic tax assessment in Suzhou, the industrial and commercial tax collection work in Zhengzhou this summer has been significantly improved. For example, we mobilized shop assistants to love the country and protect taxes. As a result, under the slogan of "guaranteeing tax revenue" jointly put forward by both labor and management, those who falsely reported their income were corrected and made supplementary reports. Seventeen industries, including hardware and national cloth, under the jurisdiction of our Second Tax Office, have raised the collective on-time tax payment movement that has already been launched to "self-check and mutual check, and report missed taxes." As a result, the seventeen industries collectively reported and re-evaluated business volume of 1.69 billion yuan, an average increase of 11.3 percent compared with the spring business volume. We were able to achieve this result because of Chairman Mao's wise leadership. I swear: I will resolutely work hard under the leadership of Chairman Mao to support the Volunteer Army!

    我要努力作好税收工作
    来支援中国人民志愿军编辑同志：
    我是一个翻身的税务工人，在旧社会里受尽了种种痛苦和侮辱。我还记得一九三九年日寇侵占上海时，我们为了要活下去，不得不冒着危险爬过封锁线去贩运大米。有一次我和五十多个同伴在通过封锁线时，当场被他们打死了六个，我和其他三十多个男女同伴被捉住。在遭到了毒打以后，三九天，还被鬼子用枪逼着我们脱光衣服跳到小河里洗“冷水澡”。更令人切齿的是鬼子们把我们的女同伴都轮奸了。日本鬼子对我们的残暴行为使我永远也不能忘记。可是，今天日本强盗的杀人血手还未干，美帝国主义又在重新武装他们准备侵略我国了，这是中国人民绝不能允许的！
    自从毛主席领导我们翻了身，我才有机会在郑州找到工作。同志们还选我当工会主席和区人民政府代表。为了努力生产，支援中国人民志愿军在朝鲜早日打垮美帝国主义，我在税收工作中曾大力帮助工商业者解除顾虑、改变经营方式，增加收入，以增加国家的税源。由于我们吸收了苏州民主评征的成功经验，郑州市今年夏季的工商业税收工作，得到显著改进。例如我们发动店员爱国护税，结果在劳资双方共同提出“保证税收”的口号下，对自报不实者，更正补报。我们第二税所辖区五金、国布等十七个行业就把已经开展起来的集体按时纳税运动提高到“自查互查、补报漏税”，结果十七个行业共补报及重新评议营业额达十六亿九千多万元，平均较春季营业额上升了百分之十一点三。我们能做出这个成绩，是由于毛主席英明领导的结果。我宣誓：坚决在毛主席的领导下，为支援志愿军而努力。
