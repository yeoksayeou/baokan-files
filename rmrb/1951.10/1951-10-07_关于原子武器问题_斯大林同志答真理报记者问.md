Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: TASS Moscow, October 6th: "Pravda" today published Comrade J.V. Stalin's answers to a "Pravda" correspondent regarding the issue of atomic weapons.

    Question: Recently, foreign newspapers have been making a lot of noise about the Soviet atomic bomb tests. What are your views on this uproar?

    Answer: Indeed, not long ago, our country tested a type of atomic bomb. According to the plan to defend our country against attacks by the Anglo-American aggressive bloc, tests of various atomic bombs of different diameters will be conducted in the future.

    Question: Various figures in the United States are warning and clamoring that the security of the United States is threatened by the atomic bomb tests. Is there any basis for this panic?

    Answer: This panic is groundless.

    American figures cannot be unaware that the Soviet Union is not only opposed to the use of atomic weapons, but also advocates banning atomic weapons and stopping the production of atomic weapons. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has repeatedly called for a ban on atomic weapons, but each time it has been rejected by the Atlantic bloc countries. This means that if the United States attacks our country, the ruling circles of the United States will use atomic bombs. It is precisely because of this situation that the Soviet Union has had to have atomic weapons in order to be fully prepared to deal with aggressors.

    Of course, the aggressors hope that when they attack the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will be unarmed. But the Soviet Union does not agree with this, and the Soviet Union believes that it should be fully prepared to deal with aggressors.

    Therefore, if the United States has no intention of attacking the Soviet Union, then the panic of American figures should be considered unwarranted and fabricated, because the Soviet Union has never had the idea of attacking the United States or any other country.

    The reason why American figures are distressed is that the secret of atomic weapons is no longer the exclusive property of the United States, but is also possessed by other countries, especially the Soviet Union. They want the United States to be a monopolist in the production of atomic bombs, and they want the United States to have unlimited possibilities to intimidate and blackmail other countries. But what is the basis for this idea of theirs, and what right do they have to think like this? Is such a monopoly needed to maintain peace? Wouldn't it be more correct to say that, on the contrary, in order to maintain peace, it is first necessary to eliminate this monopoly, and then unconditionally ban atomic weapons? I think that only when those who advocate atomic bombs see that they are no longer monopolists will they agree to ban atomic weapons.

    Question: What is your opinion on international control in the field of atomic weapons?

    Answer: The Soviet Union advocates banning atomic weapons and stopping the production of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union advocates establishing international control so that the decisions to ban atomic weapons, stop the production of atomic weapons, and completely use the atomic bombs that have already been made for civilian purposes can be fully, strictly, and honestly implemented. This is precisely the kind of international control that the Soviet Union advocates.

    American figures also talk about "control," but their "control" does not start from stopping the production of atomic weapons, but from continuing this production, with the quantity determined by the amount of raw materials possessed by each country. Therefore, the American "control" does not start from banning atomic weapons, but from making this weapon legal and legitimate. From this, it makes the right of warmongers to use atomic weapons to eliminate tens of thousands of peaceful residents legal. It is not difficult to understand that this is not control, but a mockery of control, and a deception of the people of all countries' desire for peace. It is clear that this kind of "control" cannot satisfy the peace-loving people of all countries who demand the banning of atomic weapons and the cessation of atomic weapons production.

    关于原子武器问题
    斯大林同志答真理报记者问
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：真理报今日刊载约·维·斯大林同志关于原子武器问题的答真理报记者问。
    问：关于苏联原子弹的试验，近来外国报纸在吵吵嚷嚷，你对这种吵嚷的意见怎样？
    答：的确，不久之前，我国是试验了一种类型的原子弹。按照保卫我们国家以防御英美侵略集团进攻的计划，将来还要进行各种不同直径的原子弹的试验。
    问：对于原子弹的试验，美国形形色色的人物已在告警和叫嚣美国的安全受到威胁。这种惊慌是否有任何的根据？
    答：这种惊慌是毫无根据的。
    美国的人物不会不知道：苏联不仅反对使用原子武器，而且还主张禁止原子武器，停止原子武器的生产。大家知道，苏联曾经好几次要求禁止原子武器，但是每一次都被大西洋集团国家拒绝了。这就是说，一旦美国进攻我们国家，美国统治集团就将使用原子弹。就是由于这种情况，苏联才不得不备有原子武器，以便有充分的准备对付侵略者。
    当然，侵略者希望一旦他们进攻苏联的时候，苏联没有武装。但是苏联不同意这样，苏联认为它应有充分的准备来对付侵略者。
    因此，如果美国并没有进攻苏联的意图，那末美国的人物的惊慌就应该认为是没有来由的，是虚构的，因为苏联并没有在什么时候进攻美国或其他任何国家的想法。
    美国的人物之所以苦恼，是因为原子武器的秘密已不仅仅为美国所有，而且已为其他国家、首先是苏联所有。他们想要美国成为原子弹生产的垄断者，他们想要美国拥有无限的可能性来恫吓和讹诈其他国家。但是，他们这种想法其实有什么根据呢，他们有什么权利这样想呢？难道为了保持和平，需要这种垄断吗？说事情恰恰和这相反，说为了保持和平，首先就需要消除这种垄断，然后无条件地禁止原子武器，这样岂不更正确吗？我想，只有鼓吹原子弹的人看到他们已不再是垄断者的时候，他们才可能同意禁止原子武器。
    问：对于原子武器方面的国际管制，你的意见怎样？
    答：苏联主张禁止原子武器和停止原子武器的生产。苏联主张建立国际管制，使禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、并把已经制成的原子弹完全用于民用方面的决定得到充分严格和诚实的执行。苏联所主张的正是这种国际管制。
    美国的人物也谈“管制”，但是他们的“管制”不是从停止原子武器的生产出发，而是要继续这种生产，其数量按各个国家拥有原料的数量而定。所以，美国的“管制”不是从禁止原子武器出发，而是要使这种武器成为法定的、合法的。由此，使战争贩子用原子武器来消灭成千成万和平居民的权利，成为合法的。不难了解，这不是管制，而是对管制的嘲笑，是对各国人民的和平愿望的欺骗。很明白，这种“管制”是不能使各国要求禁止原子武器和停止原子武器生产的爱好和平的人民满意的。（附图片）
