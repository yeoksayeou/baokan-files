    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Egyptian people of all strata's struggle against imperialist colonial enslavement is continuing to develop.

    Since Egypt announced the abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, the British government has continuously mobilized troops to the Suez Canal Zone. The British troops stationed in the Canal Zone quickly occupied all the important strongholds along the 110-mile-long eastern bank of the Suez Canal. The British military authorities also announced that Suez was under military occupation from the evening of October 22nd. Railway traffic in Suez and other places has been interrupted. At the same time, British troops arbitrarily shot at Egyptian sentries and people in the Canal Zone and robbed the Egyptian people of their money.

    The British policy of military intimidation and bloody suppression against the Egyptian people has been tacitly approved by the United States, which is trying to force Egypt to join the Middle East aggressive bloc. According to the United Press, quoting American "authoritative sources," "The British government has maintained the closest contact with the United States on all its military actions in the Suez Canal Zone." A U.S. State Department spokesman said on the 24th, "The U.S. government is in constant contact with Britain, France, and Turkey regarding the Anglo-Egyptian dispute."

    However, the intimidation and aggressive actions of British imperialism have not only failed to intimidate the Egyptian people, but have aroused greater anger among the Egyptian people of all strata. Large-scale anti-imperialist demonstrations have taken place in Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, and other places for several consecutive days. The slogans "British dead dogs get out," "Down with imperialism," and "Abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty" can be heard everywhere on the streets of Cairo.

    The Egyptian people's movement to boycott British goods is underway. Mass meetings in many places have passed resolutions calling on the country to boycott British goods and to raise funds for the establishment of "strike teams." Leaflets with the slogan "Don't buy British goods" are posted on the walls, and many merchants who had ordered goods from British companies have recently cancelled their orders. At 11:00 a.m. on the 23rd, Egyptian shops closed their doors to protest against the atrocities of the British army. Many shops in Cairo have painted over the English and French words on their signs.

    All workers in the Suez Canal Zone refuse to work for British ships and any foreign ships transporting goods for the British army, and as a result, a large number of British ships in the area have not been unloaded for several days.

    Mass demonstrations have also been held in many cities in Sudan for several consecutive days. British police attacked demonstrators in various places, and many people were seriously injured and many were arrested.

    埃及人民反帝斗争继续发展
    英国军事恫吓激起埃及人民更大的愤怒
    各地连日举行示威展开抵制英国货运动
    【新华社二十六日讯】埃及全国各阶层人民反对帝国主义殖民地奴役的斗争，正在继续发展中。
    自埃及宣布废除英埃条约以后，英国政府即源源调动军队，开往苏彝士运河区。驻在运河区的英军迅速占领了沿苏彝士运河一百一十英里长的东岸上所有的重要据点。英国军事当局并宣布苏彝士自十月二十二日晚起处于军事占领之下。苏彝士和其他各地的铁路交通已告中断。同时，英军在运河区任意开枪射击埃及的哨兵和人民，并抢劫埃及人民的钱财。
    英国对埃及人民所采取的军事恫吓和血腥镇压的政策，得到了力图压迫埃及参加中东侵略集团的美国的默许。据合众社引美国“权威人士”的话说：“英国政府对于它在苏彝士运河区所采取的一切军事行动，都与美国保持最密切的联系。”美国国务院发言人二十四日说：“美国政府对于英埃争端一事，经常与英、法、土保持联系。”
    但是，英帝国主义的恫吓和侵略行动，不但没有吓倒埃及人民，反而激起了埃及各阶层人民更大的愤怒。在开罗、亚历山大、塞得港等地，连日都发生了大规模的反帝示威游行。开罗街上到处可以听见“英国死狗滚出去”，“打倒帝国主义”和“废除英埃条约”等口号。
    埃及人民抵制英国货的运动，正在展开。许多地方的群众大会均通过决议，号召全国抵制英国货，并为成立“罢工队”募集基金。墙壁上贴着“不买英国货”的传单，许多曾向英国公司定货的商人最近已取消了定单。二十三日上午十一时，埃及各商店停止营业，表示对英军暴行抗议。开罗许多商店，已把招牌上的英文字和法文字涂掉。
    苏彝士运河区的全体工人拒绝给英国船及为英军运货的一切外国船工作，该地的大批英国船已因此有好几天没有卸货。
    苏丹许多城市也连日举行了群众示威。英国警察在各地攻击示威者，许多人受重伤，许多人被逮捕。
