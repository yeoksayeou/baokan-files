Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th -- Reports from Tokyo: The U.S. Occupation Headquarters in Japan is currently intimidating and bribing members of the Diet from various conservative parties in Japan, in order to ensure that the 12th Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet, which opened on October 10th, will approve the U.S.-made "Peace Treaty" with Japan and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

As early as September 14th, after Shigeru Yoshida returned to Japan from San Francisco, he intensified the persecution of Japanese Communist Party Diet members on the one hand, and launched activities to approve the U.S.-made "Peace Treaty" on the other. With the Liberal Party as the center, Yoshida used various methods to win over the opposition National Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and other reactionary members of both houses of parliament, preparing to convene the current Diet session. However, within the Japanese bourgeoisie and reactionaries, there were various objections to the U.S.-made separate "Peace Treaty" and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" signed by Yoshida. For example, the "Economist" magazine published by the Mainichi Shimbun, representing the Japanese bourgeoisie, openly rebuked "Yoshida Shigeru wants to become Wang Jingwei" in an issue published in mid-September. The U.S. occupation authorities were extremely anxious about this, and therefore tried to use despicable means such as coercion and bribery, through the Liberal Party authorities, to force the Japanese Diet to "approve" these two treaties.

On the eve of the opening of the Japanese Diet, Sebald, the Director of the Diplomatic Bureau of the U.S. Military Headquarters in Japan and political advisor to Ridgway, convened a secret meeting with the Liberal Party authorities in order to suppress the opposition of various opposition parties to the two treaties and ensure their approval. In addition to Yoshida Shigeru, the participants included Keiichi Yoshitake, Chairman of the Policy Research Council of the party, Koshichi Masuda, Secretary-General, Shinzō Tsubokawa, Deputy Secretary-General, Toshiro Tsukahara, Lobbying Minister, and Jirō Hoshijima, Chairman of the General Affairs Council. Sebald expressed great fear and unease about the rising sentiment within the Liberal Party, the National Democratic Party, and the Socialist Party against the approval of the two treaties. Sebald openly declared to the attendees that in order to guarantee the approval of the two treaties, he would not hesitate to directly exert pressure when necessary, and at the same time instructed the attendees to strengthen "propaganda" activities for the two treaties.

Immediately after the above meeting, the U.S. Military Headquarters in Japan allocated 80,000 U.S. dollars (equivalent to 28.8 million Japanese yen) to the Liberal Party leadership. Toshiro Tsukahara, the lobbying minister and Diet member of the party, received 25,000 U.S. dollars of it. In addition, Toshiro Tsukahara also received 3 million yen from relatives of the Sakai Zaibatsu as "propaganda" funds. Goro Morishima, a member of the House of Representatives from the Liberal Party and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Morio Sasaki, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Taiokichi Aso, Yoshida's son-in-law, and Munetaka Tokugawa, the leader of the Ryokufukai in the Senate, who had long been bought by the U.S. Military Headquarters in Japan and the Liberal Party, also received several thousand U.S. dollars each. They are currently investigating the attitude of each Diet member and providing secret reports to the U.S. military authorities in Japan.

    驻日美国占领军总部
    正用收买和高压手段迫日本国会批准和约
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：驻日美国占领军总部正对日本各保守党派的国会议员进行威逼和收买，以便使十月十日开幕的日本第十二届国会临时会议，能批准美制对日“和约”和“美日安全条约”。
    早在九月十四日吉田茂自旧金山回到日本后，他即一方面加紧迫害日本共产党国会议员，一方面展开批准美制“和约”的活动。吉田茂以自由党为中心，用各种方法笼络在野的反对派国民民主党、社会党及其他参众两院反动议员，筹备召开本届国会会议。但是，日本资产阶级及反动派内部，对于吉田画了押的美制单独“和约”和“美日安全条约”，却有各种反对意见。例如，代表日本资产阶级的每日新闻社出版的“经济学人”杂志，在九月中旬出版的一期中，就公开斥责“吉田茂要成为汪精卫了”。美国占领当局对此极为焦虑，因而力图以威逼和收买等卑污手段，通过自由党当权分子迫使日本国会“批准”该两项条约。
    在日本国会召开前夕，驻日美军总部外交局长、李奇微的政治顾问赛鲍尔为了压制各在野党派对该两项条约的反对，并使其得到批准，曾召集自由党当权分子举行秘密会议。与会者除吉田茂外，尚有该党政务调查会长吉武惠市、干事长增田甲子七、副干事长坪川信三、游说部长冢原俊郎及总务会长星岛二郎等。赛鲍尔对自由党、国民民主党及社会党内部日益高涨的反对批准该两项条约的情绪，表示极大的恐惧与不安。赛鲍尔公然向到会者声称，为了保证该两项条约的批准，必要时将不惜直接施以压力，同时指使到会者要为该两项条约加强“宣传”活动。
    驻日美军总部于上项会议后，立即拨款八万美元（合二千八百八十万日元）交与自由党首脑机关。该党游说部长、国会议员冢原俊郎得到其中的二万五千美元。此外，冢原俊郎又从酒井财阀亲戚处得到三百万日元，作为进行“宣传”之用。众议院自由党分子、外务委员会主席守岛伍郎、外务委员会委员佐佐木盛雄，吉田之婿麻生太贺吉以及早被驻日美军总部及自由党收买的参议院绿风会首脑德川宗敬等人，也都分得数千美元，他们正在调查每一国会议员的态度，向驻日美军当局提供密报。
