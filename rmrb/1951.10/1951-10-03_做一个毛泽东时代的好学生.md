To Be a Good Student of the Mao Zedong Era
    Wu Jiazhu, Zhou Yuli, Students of Tsinghua University

    For the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have been living a happy school life. In the New China, our future is bright!

    At the founding of the People's Republic of China, we participated in the founding ceremony and were honored to be reviewed by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. When our team passed through Tiananmen Square, every student's eyes were focused on Chairman Mao—the giant who led the 475 million Chinese people to great victory, cheering "Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao waved frequently and kindly replied to us: "Long live the students of Tsinghua University!" We felt extremely excited and proud!

    For the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we have carried out ideological remolding and political study, and we have deeply realized the correct leadership of the Communist Party over the Chinese revolution. Many students, under the leadership of the government, actively participated in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing and recognized the cruelty of the feudal class's oppression and exploitation of the peasants; many students also went to factories for internships, living with the workers, and they experienced the excellent qualities of the working class. In practice, the students strengthened their revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people and realized that young students in the Mao Zedong era must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, have a high degree of political consciousness, and work tirelessly for the interests of the motherland. For the past two years, in various great patriotic movements, the students of Tsinghua University have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. More than 1,500 students from the entire school have rushed to sign up to join military cadre schools, determined to defend the motherland. This year, 99.7 percent of the graduating students resolutely obey the government's unified allocation and go to various construction posts in the motherland.

    The people expect us to strengthen our studies, master useful science and technology, and become useful talents for the motherland. We are also consciously aware that our great motherland needs us to build it; last year, Ouyang Zhao, a student of the hydraulic engineering group who interned at the Dongliao River Water Conservancy Bureau in Northeast China, questioned the correctness of a formula that had been used for many years and copied from a Japanese book when designing the gate frame. He sacrificed his lunch break time, focused on thinking, and derived it using different methods, and the result proved that the formula was wrong and obtained the correct design formula. According to this new formula, three-quarters of the material can be saved, so he was praised by the Water Conservancy Bureau. The students of the Department of Geology went to Miyun to conduct the Yanshan geological survey, working hard on the rugged mountain roads and under the scorching sun. They picked up a strange stone by a mountain stream, and the stone seemed to be composed of small flower-like minerals. So everyone excitedly searched along the mountain stream for its source. Later, they found a large piece of basic mineral called actinolite, which gave them an inspiration: since there are so many basic minerals here, it is likely that there are metal mineral deposits nearby. They concentrated their attention, observed carefully, and ran from this bank of the river to the other, and finally found a large piece of metallic mineral, thus proving that there were mines upstream of the mountain stream. Regardless of the darkness and physical fatigue, they traced upstream and finally found six or seven layers of magnetite layers, about seven meters thick in total, discovering treasures for the motherland. They also used the same spirit of research to discover glacial erratics—important evidence of mountain valley glaciers, providing important information for the geology of New China. The students used this practical action to respond to the expectations of the country and the people and the care of the leaders.

    When participating in the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda work, some students in the Department of Electrical Engineering felt dizzy and physically exhausted due to the high heat at the Martin furnace in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, which made the students deeply realize the importance of health, and began to pay attention to sports and exercise. Now, on the playground, in the gymnasium, and on the campus track, there are students exercising at any time. The venue is too small, so the students play ball next to the houses. Many fourth-year students are determined to get the Labor Defense System Medal before graduation, because they know that only with a strong physique can they serve the motherland.

    This summer vacation, our students from the School of Engineering participated in the great Huai River Harnessing Project. The students stood below the Runheji Sluice Dam project, looking up at the rows of neat sluice gates and piers, and were reluctant to leave. One student said with relief and excitement: "I never thought that the modernized large-scale projects that could only be seen in Soviet pictorials have finally appeared on our land today." Soon, the two banks of the Huai River will become the Ukraine of our great motherland. This makes us deeply realize the superiority of the new democratic social system. Today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we must work harder to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, learn scientific and technological knowledge well, improve our physical fitness, and be ready to serve the motherland at any time and strive to the end for the realization of the great ideals of mankind!

    做一个毛泽东时代的好学生
    清华大学学生  吴家铸  周玉醴
    两年来，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们过着幸福的学校生活。在新中国，我们的前途是远大的！
    在中华人民共和国成立的时候，我们参加了开国典礼，荣幸地接受了毛主席和朱总司令的检阅。当我们的队伍经过天安门前的时候，每一个同学的视线都集中在毛主席——领导着四亿七千五百万中国人民取得伟大胜利的巨人的身上，欢呼着“毛主席万岁！”毛主席频频挥手，亲切地回答我们：“清华大学的同学们万岁！”我们感到万分的兴奋和骄傲！
    两年来，我们在共产党和人民政府的领导下，进行了思想改造和政治学习，我们深刻地体会到共产党对中国革命的正确领导。不少同学在政府的领导下，积极地参加了京郊的土地改革，认清了封建阶级对农民压迫剥削的残酷；也有不少同学到工厂去实习，和工人们生活在一起，他们体会到工人阶级的优秀品质。同学们在实践中坚定了为人民服务的革命人生观，认识到毛泽东时代的青年学生必须以毛泽东思想来武装自己，要有高度的政治觉悟，为祖国的利益作不倦的奋斗。两年来，在各种伟大的爱国运动中，清华大学的同学们发挥了高度的爱国热情。全校有一千五百余同学争先报名参加军事干部学校，决心保卫祖国。今年毕业同学百分之九十九点七坚决服从政府的统一分配，走上祖国的各个建设岗位。
    人民期望我们加强学习，掌握有用的科学技术，成为祖国有用的人材。我们也自觉地认识到伟大的祖国正需要着我们去建设；去年到东北东辽河水利局实习的水利组欧阳昭同学，在设计闸框时，对一个已经用了多年，从日文书上抄下来的公式的正确性发生了怀疑。他牺牲午睡时间，专心思索，用不同方法导算，结果证明这个公式是错误的，并得出了正确的设计公式。按照这个新公式，可节省材料四分之三，因此他受到了水利局的表扬。地质系的同学，到密云作燕山地质调查，在崎岖的山路上、炽烈的阳光下，努力工作。他们在一条山溪旁，拾到一块奇怪的石头，那块石头好像由一朵朵小花样的矿物所构成。于是大家兴奋地沿着山溪找寻它的来源。后来他们又找到一大块叫做阳起石的盐基性的矿物，它给了他们一个启发：这里既有那么多的盐基性矿物，很可能附近有金属矿藏。他们集中注意，仔细观察，从河这岸又跑到那岸，终于发现了一大块有金属光泽的矿物，因此也就证明了山溪上游有矿。他们顾不得天黑和身体的疲乏，追溯上流，最后找到了有六七层、共厚约七公尺的磁铁矿层，给祖国发现了宝藏。他们又用同样的钻研精神发现了冰迹石——山谷冰川的重要证据，给新中国的地质学提供了重要资料。同学们就用这种实际的行动来回答国家和人民的热望和领袖的关怀。
    在参加抗美援朝宣传工作时，电机系的某些同学在石景山钢铁厂的马丁炉边，因高热头发昏了，体力支不住了，这就使同学们深感到健康的重要，开始重视体育运动，和注意锻炼身体了。现在，操场上，体育馆里，校园的跑道上，随时都有同学在运动。场地太小了，同学们就在房子旁边打起球来。四年级的许多同学，决心要在毕业前得着劳动卫国制奖章，因为他们知道，有了强健的体魄，才能替祖国服务。
    今年暑假，我们工学院的同学参加了伟大的治淮工程。同学们站在润河集闸坝工程的下面，仰望着一排排整齐的闸门和闸墩，不愿离开。有一位同学欣慰而激动地说：“想不到只有在苏联画报上才能看到的近代化大工程，今天终于在我们国土上出现了。”不久，淮河的两岸将成为我们伟大祖国的乌克兰。这使我们深深地体会到新民主主义社会制度的优越性。今天，当中华人民共和国成立两周年纪念的时候，我们更要努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，学好科学技术知识，炼好身体，随时准备为祖国服务，为人类的伟大理想的实现而奋斗到底！
