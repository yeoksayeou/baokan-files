    A New Upsurge of Patriotic Labor
    ——On the Production Increase and Thrift Movement of the Northeast Working Class
       Tian Liu
    The working class's labor wisdom and creativity are inexhaustible. Although the production increase and thrift movement of the Northeast working class has not been underway for long, it has already made many enterprise leading organs and economic workers feel, in the face of the brilliant achievements created by the working class, that "there are serious conservative ideas in enterprise leadership." After Comrade Gao Gang issued the call for production increase and thrift at the urban work conference held by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in May this year, the patriotic labor of the Northeast working class has moved towards a new upsurge: The Northeast working class wants to double the realization of the Party's call, and in addition to thoroughly completing the original state production plan, it wants to increase production and save more than 10 million tons of grain in extra wealth.
    Two Obvious Characteristics
    The Northeast working class, educated and cultivated by the Party, has a high degree of political consciousness and rich labor wisdom. Since they have made a solemn promise to the motherland to increase production and save 10 million tons of grain, they will definitely be able to realize it victoriously. At the beginning of the production increase and thrift movement, two obvious characteristics appeared: the production increase and thrift plans of each factory and mine exceeded the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, and they all exceeded each other layer by layer from bottom to top in an orderly manner; the production reality of thousands of factories and mines in the entire Northeast, every team, every workshop, every factory and mine, exceeded the targets on the production increase and thrift plans that had already been greatly improved.
    Let me just give a few examples.
    When the production increase and thrift movement had just begun, the Shenyang Smelting Plant's factory headquarters required the electrolytic copper workshop to save the wealth of 1,420 tons of grain by reducing costs. After discussion among the workshop cadres, a plan was drawn up to reduce costs by 1,470 tons of grain. Each team exceeded the workshop's requirements by 48 tons, aiming to create the wealth of saving costs by 1,518 tons of grain; the Sixth Workshop of the Second Machine Factory originally had a production increase and thrift task of 9,200 tons assigned to it by the factory headquarters, requiring the equipment utilization rate to be increased from 59.6 percent to 75 percent. After repeated discussions and the development of rationalization proposals by the workshop workers, the equipment utilization rate was increased to more than 87 percent. The workers in the A group of the open-hearth furnace, in addition to ensuring the full realization of the workshop's plan, also improved the product quality from 98 percent to 99 percent, and greatly exceeded the indicators required by the leadership in saving raw materials such as magnesite. The open-hearth furnace group alone can increase production and save the wealth of more than 9,600 tons of grain, which is 400 tons higher than the entire workshop's plan.
    The working class will never be satisfied with the achievements already made, and they are constantly pursuing greater contributions to the motherland. When Comrade He Xiaoning, director of the Fifth Electrical Factory, talked about the new upsurge of patriotic labor of the working class in the production increase and thrift movement, which rapidly improved and increased production, he assessed the creative labor of the working class in this way: "The undiscovered power is much greater than the power that has already been discovered." The factory used to be able to produce 300 motors per month, and after the production increase and thrift movement was launched, it will be able to produce 1,100 more motors by the end of the year. He asserted: As long as we continue to improve enterprise management, promote advanced experience, and study technology, the potential in the enterprise can be greatly developed, and production can be increased even further.
    So, how much potential does a people's enterprise have? The workers of the Fourth Rubber Factory said: "No beginning and no end—infinitely." The brilliant achievements of the factory in increasing production and saving money in the past three months have eloquently proved that the workers' words are correct. In the three years since liberation, the factory's production has increased fourfold, which is more than three times higher than the highest year of production under the puppet Manchurian regime—1940. The efficiency of various machines has increased by 31 percent to more than 100 percent compared to the Japanese puppet rule. It stands to reason that it seems that the factory "has not much potential anymore, right?" The fact is quite the opposite. The workers of the Fourth Rubber Factory themselves formulated a production increase and thrift plan that greatly exceeded the requirements of the Light Industry Administration, with each worker creating an average value of 100 tons of grain for the country. After the implementation of this plan, two new factories of the same scale and equipment as the Fourth Rubber Factory can be built. The facts of three months have proved that the workers of the Fourth Rubber Factory are not only able to complete but have already exceeded their plan. The output in July increased by more than 18 percent compared to the plan, and the cost was reduced by more than 10 percent compared to the plan. The wealth created by increasing production and saving money in July and August alone is equivalent to more than 14,000 tons of grain.
    The Real Source of the Unlimited Potential of People's Enterprises
    The working class's meticulous care for the people's enterprises and their selfless creative labor are the real source of the unlimited potential of the people's enterprises. The workers said, "We ourselves are the potential," which is not false at all. In the production increase and thrift movement, the workers of many factories established "brainstorming, finding tricks, and tapping potential" production meetings or technical research associations, and many production difficulties were solved through the joint efforts of the workers. The melting department of the Dalian Glass Factory, under the leadership of labor model Liu Maoyou, launched extensive rationalization proposals in the production increase and thrift movement. In July and August, they solved ten major technical problems in a row, increasing output by 40 percent, reducing costs by 20 percent, and improving quality by 1.2 percent. The Sun Hongyou team thought of various ways to improve product quality, completely eliminating third-class products and increasing first-class products from 85 percent to 95 percent. In July and August, they had already created an extra wealth of 252 tons of grain. The original production increase and thrift task of their team was 462 tons of grain, and now they have automatically increased it to 700 tons.
    The Production Increase and Thrift Movement
    Is a Movement to Comprehensively Improve Production
    The Northeast working class, which regards the people's enterprises as its own vital cause, understands that the production increase and thrift movement is not only about creating huge amounts of extra-planned wealth, but also a comprehensive movement to improve production. With the development of the production increase and thrift movement, the workers of each factory are more actively learning advanced experience, improving operating methods, cherishing labor time, improving labor organization, transforming tools, and improving equipment utilization rates..., tapping and developing the potential strength of industry from all aspects. The barrel-making workshop of the Fifth Machine Factory learned Guo Valov's working method, integrated the operating advantages of each worker, and made it the operating method of each worker, greatly improving production. After the welders of the solder group learned the soldering skills of veteran workers such as Liu Wenda, production efficiency doubled. After the Fourth Rubber Factory promoted Jiang Wanshou's advanced experience in improving labor organization, all work that did not require too high skills was done by auxiliary workers or apprentices, allowing skilled workers to give full play to their skills and specialize in technical work; the shoe-making workshop changed the labor organization, increasing production efficiency by 20 percent; the pressing workshop not only solved the difficulty of insufficient skilled workers, but also produced 2,600 more pairs of rubber shoes every day, creating an additional 20 tons of grain wealth for the country in one day.
    The Party's Political Work Has Been Further Strengthened
    The Level of Awareness of Employees Has Been Further Improved
    In the production increase and thrift movement, the Party's political work and propaganda work have been further strengthened, and the awareness of the broad masses of employees has been further improved. When the workers clearly understood that every new achievement they made in production accelerated the process of national industrialization, the workers' enthusiasm for labor became even higher, and each worker contributed all their labor wisdom and enthusiasm to our great motherland, striving to make more brilliant achievements in the production increase and thrift movement. The workers of the forging workshop of the Fushun Repair Factory said in a letter to Comrade Gao Gang: "Every time we strike a hammer and burn a piece of iron, we think of being responsible to the country." In August, they completed 64 percent of the year's production increase and thrift task. The workers of Dalian Seaport completed the year's loading and unloading task on September 20. Eight factories in Benxi City increased production and saved 55,000 tons of grain wealth in July, and it had jumped to more than 123,000 tons in August. According to the statistics of 62 factories in five cities including Shenyang and Anshan, on the eve of National Day, more than 1.6 million tons of extra wealth had been created. The working class's labor wisdom and creativity are inexhaustible, and any kind of production miracle can be created in the working class's selfless labor. Among the 38 main products of the factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry of the Northeast People's Government, 35 products exceeded the state's production plan in September, of which open-hearth steel exceeded 67.6 percent; electric furnace steel exceeded 84.8 percent; and machine tools exceeded 2.2 times.
    The production increase and thrift movement is being carried out and deepened rapidly in all state-owned and public-private joint enterprises in the Northeast, and the labor wisdom and creativity of the broad masses of employees are being more fully developed in the new upsurge of patriotic labor. The working class's selfless and selfless creative labor has enabled and will continue to enable Northeast's industrial construction to achieve new brilliant achievements.

    爱国主义劳动的新高涨
    ——记东北工人阶级的增产节约运动
       田流
    工人阶级的劳动智慧与创造力，是无穷无尽的。东北工人阶级的增产节约运动虽然展开不久，却已经使不少企业领导机关和许多经济工作人员，在工人阶级创造的辉煌成就面前，感到“企业领导上存在着严重的保守思想”了。高岗同志在今年五月，中共中央东北局举行的城市工作会议上，发出增产节约的号召后，东北工人阶级的爱国主义劳动走向了新的高涨：东北工人阶级要双倍地实现党的号召，除彻底完成国家原订生产计划之外，要增产节约一千余万吨粮食的超额财富。两个明显的特点
    在党教育培养下的东北工人阶级，是有高度政治觉悟与丰富劳动智慧的，他们既然向祖国作了增产节约千万吨粮食的庄严的许诺，就一定能够胜利地实现它。增产节约运动一开始，就出现了两个明显的特点：每个厂、矿的增产节约计划，都超过了上级分配的任务，而且都是有顺序地从下往上地层层超过；全东北数以千计的厂、矿，每一小组、每一车间、每一厂矿的生产实际，又都超过了已经大大提高了的增产节约计划上的指标。
    让我随便举几个例子吧。
    增产节约运动刚开始时，沈阳冶炼厂厂部，要求电解铜车间从降低成本中，节约一千四百二十吨粮食的财富，车间干部讨论后，订出了降低成本一千四百七十吨粮食的计划，而各个小组又超过了车间要求四十八吨，要创造节约成本一千五百一十八吨粮食的财富；第二机器厂第六车间，原来厂部给它九千二百吨的增产节约任务，要求把设备运用率由百分之五十九点六，提高到百分之七十五，经车间工人反复讨论、开展合理化建议，使设备运用率提高到百分之八十七以上，平炉班甲组工友，除保证充分实现车间计划外，更使产品质量由百分之九十八提到九十九，而且在节约镁砂等原料上，大大超过了领导上要求的指标，仅平炉班就可增产节约九千六百余吨粮食的财富，比整个车间的计划还高出四百吨。
    工人阶级从不会满足于已经得到的成就，他们永不停歇地追求着对祖国的更大贡献。电工五厂厂长何效宁同志在谈到增产节约运动中，工人阶级爱国主义劳动的新高涨，使生产迅速改善和提高的情形时，这样估价工人阶级的创造性劳动：“没有发现的力量，比已经发现的力量要大得多。”该厂过去每月能产三百台电机，增产节约运动开展后，到年底能再多产一千一百台电机。他断定：只要继续改进企业管理，推广先进经验，钻研技术，企业中的潜力还可大大发挥，生产还能提得更高。
    那么，人民企业的潜力究竟有多大呢？橡胶四厂工人说：“没头没脑——无穷无尽。”该厂三个月来增产节约的辉煌成就，雄辩地证明了工人的话是正确的。解放三年来，该厂生产已经上升了四倍，比伪满产量最高的年份——一九四○年还高出三倍多，各种机器的效率，已比日伪统治时提高百分之三十一到一倍以上。照理，好像该厂“再没有多少潜力了吧？”事实恰恰相反，橡胶四厂工人，自己订出的增产节约计划，大大超过了轻工业管理局的要求，每个工人平均为国家创造价值一百吨粮食的财富。这一计划实现后，可以再建立两个像第四橡胶厂同样规模同样设备的新工厂。三个月的事实证明，橡胶四厂工人，不但能够完成而且已经超过了自己的计划。七月份的产量比计划提高了百分之十八多，成本比计划还降低了百分之十以上。七、八两个月增产节约的财富，就等于一万四千多吨粮食。人民企业无限潜力的真正
    源泉
    工人阶级对人民企业无微不至的关怀和忘我的创造性劳动，是人民企业具有无限潜力的真正源泉，工人们说：“我们自己就是潜力”，这话一点不假，增产节约运动中，许多工厂的工人，建立起“动脑筋、找窍门、挖潜力”的生产会议或技术研究会，许多生产上的困难，在工人的共同努力下解决了。劳动模范刘茂有领导下的大连玻璃工厂溶化部，在增产节约运动中，展开广泛的合理化建议，七、八月份一连解决了十个重大的技术问题，使产量提高百分之四十，成本降低百分之二十，质量也提高百分之一点二。孙宏友小组想各种办法改善产品质量，完全消灭了三等品，使一等品由百分之八十五提高到九十五，七、八两个月已创造二百五十二吨粮食的超额财富，他们小组原来的增产节约任务是四百六十二吨粮食，现在他们自动地把它提高到七百吨。增产节约运动
    是全面改善生产的运动
    将人民企业看作自己切身事业的东北工人阶级懂得，增产节约运动，不仅要创造巨额的超计划财富，还是个全面的改善生产运动，随着增产节约运动的展开，各厂工人，都更积极地学习先进经验、改进操作法、珍贵劳动时间、改善劳动组织、改造工具、提高设备运用率……，从各方面发掘和发挥工业的潜在力量。机器五厂制桶车间，学习郭瓦廖夫工作方法，综合每个工人的操作优点，成为每个工人的操作方法，大大地改善了生产。焊锡组工友学习老工人刘文达等的焊锡技术后，生产效率提高了一倍。橡胶四厂推广了姜万寿改进劳动组织的先进经验后，一切不需太高技术的工作都由辅助工人或学徒工作，使技术工人更充分地发挥他的技术，专作技术活；制帮车间改变劳动组织，使生产效率提高百分之二十；压成车间不仅解决了技术工人不足的困难，还每天多生产二千六百双胶鞋，一天就为国家多创造二十吨粮食的财富。党的政治工作进一步加强
    职工觉悟程度进一步提高
    增产节约运动中，党的政治工作和宣传工作进一步加强，广大职工的觉悟进一步提高了。当工人们清楚了他们在生产上每一个新的成就都加速着国家工业化的进程时，工人的劳动积极性就更加高涨起来，每个工人都把自己全部的劳动智慧和热情，贡献给我们的伟大祖国，都争取在增产节约运动中，作出更辉煌的成就。抚顺机修厂锻造车间工人给高岗同志的信上说：“打一鎯头、烧一块铁，都想到要对国家负责。”八月份他们完成了全年增产节约任务的百分之六十四。大连海港工人，九月二十日便完成了全年的装卸任务。本溪市八个工厂，七月份增产节约五万五千吨粮食的财富，而八月份已跃升到十二万三千吨以上。据沈阳、鞍山等五个城市六十二个工厂的统计，国庆节前夕，已创造出一百六十余万吨的超额财富。工人阶级的劳动智慧和创造力是无穷无尽的，什么样的生产奇迹都会在工人阶级忘我的劳动中创造出来。东北人民政府工业部所属厂、矿的三十八种主要产品中，九月份有三十五种产品超过了国家的生产计划，其中平炉钢材超过百分之六十七点六；电炉钢材超过八十四点八；工作母机则超过了二点二倍。
    增产节约运动，正日益迅速地在东北所有国、公营企业中开展和深入，广大职工的劳动智慧与创造力，在爱国主义劳动的新高涨中，更充分地发挥出来，工人阶级忘我无私的创造性劳动，已经使东北的工业建设，获得了并将继续获得新的辉煌成就。
