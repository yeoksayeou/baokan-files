I deeply realize the importance of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union

    In the past two years, the Shijingshan Power Plant has undergone significant changes. Before liberation, people called our power plant the "Dark Company." The Japanese and Americans believed that the machines here were old, broken, and unusable. After liberation, the workers became masters of their own house, and their enthusiasm increased. In 1949, the power plant shone brightly, but there were still area-based power outages. It was only after the arrival of Soviet experts at the end of 1949 that it transformed from a dilapidated hodgepodge into a truly people's enterprise, guaranteeing the capital's electricity supply and industrial power use in North China, and reducing accidents.

    Upon their arrival at our factory, the first major task undertaken by the Soviet experts was to help us repair Generator No. ×. Generator No. × was the largest generator in inland China, accounting for half of our plant's power output. It had been severely damaged during the liberation of Beijing in 1949. After the arrival of the Soviet experts, they worked with us from morning to night, sometimes even skipping lunch and continuing into the evening. They used their advanced experience to help us overcome numerous difficulties, and finally, within a short two months, they repaired the generator. I myself was also elected as a National Model Worker because I was able to unite the masses and overcome difficulties in this repair of Generator No. ×. It should be said that the honor I received is inseparable from the help of the Soviet experts.

    The work of the Soviet experts corrected our conservative thinking and empiricism. In the past, many workers in our plant believed that our plant was an "old and worn-out power plant of three generations, with more than two hundred rollers; unless the sun rises in the west, there will be accidents." Even the leadership believed that equipment had to be added, otherwise the capital's electricity supply could not be guaranteed. However, after the Soviet experts inspected the plant, they believed that if the potential of the plant's existing equipment could be utilized and the machine output increased, the capital's electricity supply could be safely guaranteed, and there would be no need to add equipment within two years. The Soviet experts also put forward many rationalization proposals, using facts to prove the correctness of their views. For example, Generator No. ×, after accepting the Soviet experts' proposal to install a connecting pipe, saved plant power consumption, and would not affect power generation in the event of circulating pump failure. Another example is the steam turbine, which originally had only one condensate pump (i.e., condenser). If a failure occurred, the turbine would have to be stopped. After the Soviet experts suggested adding a condensate pump, the turbine would not have to be stopped. For example, our turbine plant used to be very passive due to frequent accidents. After adopting the regulations and other suggestions compiled by the Soviet experts, we reduced misoperation and improved machine output, thereby reducing accidents, and the work shifted from passive to active. In total, the Soviet experts put forward more than 300 rationalization proposals in two years. These rationalization proposals enabled our plant's equipment to fully utilize its potential and increased machine output. In 1949, our plant's machine output only reached 70% of the quota, while now it has reached more than 90%. We are preparing to strive to reach 100% next year!

    The Soviet experts' conscientious and responsible spirit is truly admirable. Some workers in the plant casually wasted gasified water, using it to wash their hands or mix mud. The Soviet experts believed this was too wasteful. When the oil level of the transformer oil switch was not visible, the Soviet experts immediately found the foreman and engineer, explained the danger of oil shortage, and demanded that oil be added immediately. The Soviet experts were always so friendly to us Chinese workers. Every morning when we met, they always shook our hands and greeted us kindly. I remember that before I saw the Soviet experts, although I had a slight understanding of the Soviet Union, I still didn't quite believe that foreigners would be very good to our workers, because in the past I had seen many foreign engineers dislike the smell of workers and pinch their noses when they passed by them. But one day, just as I was wiping off oil sludge, a Soviet expert came and shook hands with all the workers and greeted them. I was very anxious at the time, fearing that the oil sludge on my hands would stain the expert's hands, but the Soviet expert extended a hand of friendship to me, and then personally went to work on the machine, getting covered in oil sludge and rust. This incident moved me greatly, and from then on, my view of the Soviet experts completely changed. The Soviet experts helped the workers patiently. For example, once when a crane was hoisting a turbine blade of Generator No. ×, the Soviet expert came and saw that the wire rope was tied incorrectly, fearing danger, he immediately ordered the crane to stop. He personally went up and tied it as an example. The workers were all very impressed and said they had never seen such a good expert.

    In the past two years, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the Shijingshan Power Plant has been of great help to our contact with Soviet experts. I deeply realize the importance of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. I hope that all workers will study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union well to build our great motherland!

    我深深体会到学习苏联先进经验的重要
    刘德珍
    两年来，石景山发电厂有了大的改变。在解放前，人家把我们这个发电厂叫作“黑暗公司”，日本人和美国人都认为这里的机器都是又破又旧不能用的。解放以后，工人自己当了家，积极性提高了，在一九四九年，发电厂已大放光明，但是还得分区停电。到一九四九年底，苏联专家来了，才由破烂不堪的杂货摊变成了真正人民的企业，保证了首都的光明及华北工业用电，并且减少了事故。
    苏联专家一到我们厂里，第一桩大事就是帮助我们修复×号机。×号机是关内最大的发电机，负荷占我厂发电力的一半，在一九四九年北京解放时受到了严重的破坏。苏联专家来后，每天从早到晚和我们一起工作，有时连中午饭也不吃，晚上还要接着干，并且利用他们的先进经验帮助我们克服了重重困难，终于在短短两个月之内把这架发电机修好了。我本人也因为在这次修复×号机中能团结群众，克服困难，被推选为全国劳动模范。应该说，我得到这样的光荣也是和苏联专家的帮助分不开的。
    苏联专家的工作纠正了我们保守思想和经验主义。过去我厂许多工人都认为我们这个厂是“老少三代的破电厂，滚子就有二百多，要不出事故，除非太阳西天出”。甚至领导上也认为必须添置设备，否则不能保证首都的光明。但是经过苏联专家检查以后，认为如果能发挥厂内现有设备的潜在能力，提高机器出力，那就可以安全保证首都的光明，并且在两年之内不必添置设备。苏联专家并且提出了许多合理化建议，用事实来证明了他们的正确的看法。譬如×号机，在接受苏联专家的建议按装联络管以后，节省了厂用电，并且在循环泵烧毁时不致影响发电，又如汽机原来只有一台复水泵
    （即凝结器），一发生故障，汽机就得停止，经苏联专家建议增加一台复水泵后，汽机就不致于停止了。又譬如我们汽机厂，从前因为事故多，工作很被动，在采用了苏联专家所编制的规程及其他建议后，减少了误操作，并提高了机器出力，因而就减少了事故，工作从被动走向了主动。总计在两年之内，苏联专家所提的合理化建议有三百多件。这些合理化建议使我厂设备充分发挥了潜在能力，提高了机器出力。一九四九年我厂机器出力只达定额百分之七十，而现在则已达到百分之九十以上，我们准备在明年争取达到百分之百呢！
    苏联专家认真负责的精神真使我们佩服。厂内有些工人随便糟踏气化水，把气化水用来洗手或调泥土，苏联专家认为太浪费了。变压器油开关的油面看不见了，苏联专家也马上找领班和工程师，说明缺油的危险，并且要求立刻上油。苏联专家和我们中国工人总是那样亲热，每天早晨见面时，总是亲切地和我们握手问好。记得我还没有看到苏联专家以前，虽然对于苏联略有认识，但还不大相信外国人会对我们工人很好，因为过去我曾看见许多外国工程师嫌工人臭，走过工人旁边时要捏鼻子。但是有一天，正当我在擦油泥的时候，苏联专家来了，他和所有的工人都握手问好，我当时很着急，怕手上的油泥弄脏了专家的手，但是苏联专家却向我伸出了友谊的手，随后就亲自上机器去工作了，弄得一身油泥铁锈，这件事使我感动极了，从此我对苏联专家的看法完全改变了。苏联专家帮助工人工作很耐心，比如有一次在起重机吊×号机汽叶时，苏联专家来看到钢丝绳拴得不对，怕出危险，立刻叫起重机停下来，他亲自上去拴了个样子，工人们看了都很佩服，都说从未见过这样好的专家。
    这两年来，石景山发电厂中苏友好协会的工作对我们与苏联专家的联系有很大的帮助。我深深地体会到学习苏联先进经验的重要，我希望所有的工人都好好地学习苏联的先进经验，来建设我们的伟大祖国！
