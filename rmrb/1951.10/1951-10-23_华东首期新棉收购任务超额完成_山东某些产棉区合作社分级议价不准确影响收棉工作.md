    Hua East has overfulfilled its first phase of new cotton purchase tasks. As of October 15th, cotton cooperatives in various regions had purchased and stored 25% more lint than the original target. Cotton farmers in various areas generally began collective cotton selling campaigns around the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the first batch of cotton was picked. Cotton farmers had discussed their life experiences in various meetings, further realizing that national interests and individual interests are consistent, and therefore universally included the provisions of "pick quickly, dry quickly, select quickly, sell quickly" for new cotton in their patriotic covenants. Three sentences widely circulated in rural areas of southern Jiangsu: "Without resisting America and aiding Korea, both people and wealth are insecure"; "Without land reform, there is no way to produce"; "Without suppressing counter-revolutionaries, production is uneasy." In Taicang County, in the same region, 80% of farm households revised their family patriotic covenants and collectively sold patriotic cotton. The county's first phase of purchasing five million jin of new cotton was completed half a month early, at the end of September, exceeding the original plan by 480,000 jin. Donations for the "Taicang Farmers" fighter plane were paid in full within a week, with an extra two hundred million yuan. By late September, cotton farmers in Zhejiang, northern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, and the suburbs of Shanghai all put forward the slogan "Welcome National Day, sell patriotic cotton quickly." As a result, these regions overfulfilled the entire month's plan by 1.5 to more than 7 times before National Day. In Wuqiao County, Shandong, cotton farmers in Zhangzhuang Township sold 42,000 jin of seed cotton in one day to welcome National Day.
    This year, the new cotton purchase work in the Hua East region was entirely undertaken by cotton area cooperatives that were newly developed this spring. In order to help cotton farmers collectively sell and store new cotton, cotton area cooperatives in various regions committed more than 32,000 people to this work, and established more than 3,600 new flower collection and supply stations. Most cotton farmers in Hua East have joined cooperatives, so this year's cotton purchase work is being carried out in a more organized and orderly manner. Many cooperatives have flexibly adopted purchase methods suitable for the busy farming season, such as setting up more flower collection points, rotating markets, and going to the countryside with goods, while also carrying out patriotic propaganda and education, thus greatly improving the efficiency of purchases. Cooperatives in cotton-producing areas of Shandong generally promoted the method of mobile cotton collection by going to the countryside with goods, and the amount of cotton collected increased by more than double. Whenever a mobile cotton collection team arrived in a village, the farmers in the village enthusiastically sold cotton collectively. The cotton farmers also spontaneously organized to help cooperative personnel find houses, inspect cotton, grade it, watch scales, and provide security and guard duty.
    As the collective cotton selling campaign unfolds, more and more cotton farmers in various parts of Hua East are storing new cotton in cooperatives. In the Songjiang Prefecture of southern Jiangsu, the new cotton accepted by the county cooperatives from cotton farmers accounted for about 24% to 40% of the total cotton collected.

    In the cotton-producing areas of Dezhou and Huimin in Shandong, cooperatives did not properly grasp the principles of cotton grading and pricing in the work of purchasing new cotton, which affected the progress of cotton purchase work. In many areas, due to the low technical level of grading personnel, and the existence of localism in individual units, the control of grading and pricing was unstable, resulting in cotton prices fluctuating. Some cooperative cadres deliberately downgraded and raised prices when collecting cotton, in order to encourage cotton farmers to sell more cotton; some cooperatives competed with other cooperatives (especially in areas bordering two counties) to purchase cotton, and arbitrarily changed prices, resulting in inconsistent prices between societies and regions, causing dissatisfaction among cotton farmers. They reflected: "Two prices in one area." "Cooperatives are unfair." This affected the progress of cotton purchase work. Such a situation has now attracted the attention of party committees and governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas, and some areas are trying to find solutions. In the Liangji District of Wuqiao, seventeen primary cooperatives, under the personal control of the county and district party secretaries, separately convened meetings of the directors, supervisors, and graders of each cooperative to study and resolve the problem of inconsistent grading. At the meeting, comrades from the Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company explained in detail the importance of grading and the grading methods. In order to help graders of each society improve their professional skills, cotton grading exams were held with three different grades of cotton samples, and everyone was mobilized to compare and unify understanding. After listening to the report by Chen Boqi, deputy secretary of the county party committee, they further realized that: the problems in the grading work in the past were not only technical problems, but also ideological problems. The Nanxuwang Cooperative reviewed its purely buying and selling viewpoint that disregarded price policies, saying, "When cotton farmers come to sell cotton, we are afraid that the cheap price will make them run away." "After losing more than three million in transfers, we lowered prices and complained to the masses." In order to improve grading skills and effectively implement price policies, each society has formulated a system of meeting every five days. Graders of each society gather regularly at the processing and ginning points to jointly study and solve the grading problems of each society in order to avoid the confusion of inconsistent grading. The Grading Guidance Group of the Dongguang County Cotton Purchase and Storage Committee also convened a meeting of grading personnel from nine cooperatives in the third district of the county to conduct a grading test, which improved the grading personnel's understanding of the grading work. The Shikou Office of the Huimin Prefecture Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company, in order to solve the problem of inconsistent cotton prices in the border area between Guangrao and Putai counties, convened a meeting of the directors of the cooperatives in the fifth district of Putai and the eighth and ninth districts of Guangrao through the financial and economic committees of the two counties, and jointly formed a cotton joint evaluation committee, which decided to hold a meeting every ten days to study the implementation of cotton prices. Other places are also starting to work on it. (Originally published in Shandong Dazhong Daily)
    Editor's note: Strictly implementing cotton grading and pricing is the key to implementing the policy of high quality cotton for high prices. Some cooperative cadres in several cotton-producing areas have not yet paid attention to this issue, and they believe that implementing grading and pricing is an "unnecessary trouble," which has affected the progress of cotton purchase work. The problems exposed in Dezhou and Huimin prefectures of Shandong, and the solutions to these problems, should attract the attention of all regions.

    华东首期新棉收购任务超额完成
    山东某些产棉区合作社分级议价不准确影响收棉工作
    华东区第一期收购新棉任务已超额完成。截至十月十五日止，各地合作社购储的皮棉已超过原定任务百分之二十五。各地棉农一般在采摘头遍花的中秋节前后，就展开了集体售棉运动。棉农们曾在各种会议上漫谈自己的生活体验，更进一步认识了国家利益和个人利益是一致的，因而普遍把“快摘、快晒、快拣、快卖”新棉的条文订在自己的爱国公约里。苏南区农村中广泛流传着三句话：“没有抗美援朝，人财两不保”，“没有土地改革，生产无办法”，“没有镇压反革命，生产不安宁”。该区太仓县百分之八十的农户修订了家庭爱国公约，集体售卖爱国棉。全县第一期五百万斤的新棉收购计划，提前半月于九月底完成，并超出原计划四十八万斤。“太仓农民号”战斗机的献款一周内交清，还多了二亿多元。到九月下旬，浙江、皖北、苏南及上海市郊的棉农都提出了“迎接国庆，快卖爱国棉”的口号。因此这些地区都在国庆节前超额完成全月计划的一倍半到七倍多。山东吴桥县张庄乡棉农为迎接国庆节，一天内即售籽棉四万二千斤。
    今年华东区新棉收购工作，全部是由今年春季刚发展起来的棉区合作社负责进行的。各产棉区合作社为了帮助棉农集体售储新棉，投入这一工作的人员有三万二千多人，新设的收花站、供应站有三千六百多个。华东区多数棉农都加入了合作社，因此今年的购棉工作进行得更有组织有秩序。许多合作社灵活地采取了增设收花点、轮回赶集、带货下乡等适合农忙季节的收购方法，同时进行了爱国主义的宣传教育，因而大大提高了收购效率。山东产棉区合作社普遍推行了带货下乡流动收棉的办法，收棉量增加一倍以上。流动收棉小组每到一村，村里农民就热烈地集体售棉。棉农们并自动组织起来帮助合作社人员找房子、看棉花、评级、看秤和担任保卫警戒工作。
    随着集体售棉运动的展开，华东各地棉农越来越多地向合作社存储新棉。苏南区松江专区各县合作社接受棉农存储的新棉已占总收棉量的百分之二十四到四十左右。（新华社）
    山东德州、惠民等棉产区合作社，在收购新棉工作中没有很好地掌握棉花分级议价的原则，影响了购棉工作的进展。很多地区，由于分级人员技术水平低，及个别单位存在着本位思想，对于分级议价的掌握不稳，致棉价忽高忽低。有的合作社干部收棉时，故意降级提价，争取棉农多卖棉花；有的合作社与其他合作社（特别是在两县交界地区）争购棉花，也任意变动价格，造成社与社间及地区之间价格不一致，引起棉农不满。他们反映：“一个地区两样价。”“合作社不公平。”影响了棉花收购工作的进展。这样的情况，现在已引起棉产区中共各级党委及各级人民政府的注意，有的地区正在想办法解决。吴桥梁集区十七个基层合作社，在中共县委、区委书记亲自掌握下，分别召开了各合作社理、监事及分级员会议，研究与解决分级不一致的问题。会上由花纱布公司的同志详细讲解分级的重要及分级方法。为了帮助各社分级员提高业务技术，特以三种不同等级的棉样，举行了棉花分级的考试，并发动大家共同评比，统一认识。在听了县委副书记陈伯颀报告后，他们更进一步认识到：过去分级工作发生问题，不仅是技术问题，也是思想问题。南徐王合作社检讨不顾价格政策的单纯买卖观点说：“棉农来售棉，咱就怕价钱贱跑了。”“转账时赔了三百多万，才又压低价格向群众叫起苦来。”各社为了提高分级技术，有效地贯彻价格政策，特制定了五天一碰头的制度，各社分级员定期向加工轧花点集合，共同研究与解决各社分级问题，以避免分级不一致的混乱现象。东光县购储棉委员会分级指导组亦召集了该县第三区九个合作社分级人员会议，举行分级测验，提高了分级人员对分级工作的认识。惠民专区花纱布公司史口办事处，为解决广饶、蒲台两县接壤地带的棉价不一致的问题，特通过两县财政经济委员会，召开了蒲台五区及广饶八、九区合作社主任会议，共同组成了棉花联评委员会，决定十天召开会议一次，研究棉价执行情况。其他各地有的也在着手进行。（原载山东大众日报）
    编者按：严格实行棉花分级议价，是贯彻优棉优价政策的关键。若干产棉区的合作社干部，还没有重视这一问题，他们认为实行分级议价，是一种“不必要的麻烦”，结果影响了购棉工作的进展。山东德州、惠民专区暴露的问题，及解决这个问题的办法，应该引起各地的注意。
