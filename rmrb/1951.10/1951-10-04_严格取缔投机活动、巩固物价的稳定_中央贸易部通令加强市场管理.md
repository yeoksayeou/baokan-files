Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government recently issued a circular to the trade administrative departments of local people's governments to strengthen market management. Because land reform has been completed in most parts of the country, agricultural production has rapidly recovered, and urban-rural material exchange has been developed, the purchasing power of farmers has significantly increased, and the market has experienced a situation where the off-season is not weak this summer. Now it is the autumn harvest season and faces a commercial peak season. At the same time, due to the development of domestic economic construction work, the demand for various construction materials has greatly increased. Under such circumstances, some unscrupulous merchants seek exorbitant profits, hoard and refuse to sell, and engage in speculation. In Shanghai and Tianjin, it has been discovered that these merchants have violated the policies and decrees of the People's Government and undermined price stability. In order to consolidate price stability and strengthen market management, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government specifically issued a circular to the trade administrative departments of the major administrative regions and the five provinces of Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, as well as the two municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, to formulate separate regulations in accordance with the spirit of the "Several Instructions on Suppressing Speculative Commerce" issued by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government on November 14 last year, and to cooperate with relevant departments to conduct timely inspections, and to impose strict penalties on merchants engaged in speculative activities.

    中央贸易部通令加强市场管理
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府贸易部最近通令各地人民政府贸易行政部门加强市场管理。由于全国大部地区土地改革完成，农业生产迅速恢复和城乡物资交流开展，农民购买力显著提高，今夏市场上出现了淡季不淡的情况；目前又值秋收，面临商业旺季；同时，又由于国内经济建设工作的开展，各种建设物资的需要量大增。在这种情况下，有些不法商人图谋暴利，囤积拒售，投机取巧，在上海、天津已先后发现了这些商人违反人民政府的政策法令，破坏物价稳定的行为。中央人民政府贸易部为了巩固物价的稳定，加强市场管理，特通令所属各大行政区和河北、平原、山西、察哈尔、绥远五省及北京、天津二市人民政府的贸易行政部门，根据去年十一月十四日中央人民政府贸易部颁发的关于取缔投机商业的几项指示的精神，制定单行法规，并配合有关部门及时检查，对于进行投机活动的商户予以严格处分。
