In early October, the patriotic pact of farmer Chen Yushan's family from Wufeng Township attracted a lot of attention at the Patriotic Pact Exhibition held in Nanchong City, Northern Sichuan. Chen Yushan's family patriotic pact was established in April and revised once in June. When the pact was made, the whole family had a democratic discussion, and everyone made their own work plan to ensure the realization of the family patriotic pact. During implementation, the whole family held regular family meetings for inspection, and adopted methods such as production increase competitions, rewards and criticisms to encourage the whole family to progress. Driven by the patriotic pact, the whole family showed an unprecedented atmosphere of joy and upward mobility. All thirty-odd *tiao* of fields were cultivated with four plows and four harrows, with careful and intensive farming, and nearly one-third more manure was applied than last year. Each *tiao* of field yielded one and a half *dou* more grain than in previous years. The eldest son, Chen Shichun, was so active in his work that he not only completed his own plan, but also helped military families with their work for a few days. The whole family discussed and decided to reward him with a set of clothes. The second son, Chen Shixin, also started a competition with his elder brother. The eldest daughter-in-law, Deng Suqing, worked hard with her head down. In order to complete her plan of picking ten *jin* of manure and cutting five *bei luo* of grass every day, she got up to work every day at the crack of dawn. In the past, the family could not afford livestock, but this year there are three big pigs wagging their tails and two piglets in the pen. Ten plump chicks scurry around in the yard. In the past, no one in the family was literate, but now they all participate in learning. Even during the busy farming season, they go to night school every day, and even the old lady understands the reasons for resisting America and aiding Korea. She said: "If the country can be defended, the family can be defended. The volunteers are fighting American imperialism for us at the front, of course we must support them." In addition to ensuring support for government policies and decrees, and ensuring that agricultural taxes are paid quickly and well, the whole family also donated a fat pig to the volunteers to buy airplanes and cannons on the basis of increased production.

Chen Yushan's family patriotic pact has played a leading role in the whole village, township and city. When Wufeng Township mobilized the masses to check, revise and supplement the patriotic pact, it focused on Village Six as a key pilot village. Chen Yushan's family was selected as a typical household. All the village cadres participated in Chen Yushan's family meeting to see how his family made the patriotic pact, what benefits the establishment of the patriotic pact would bring to the country and to themselves, and to learn how to check and revise the patriotic pact, and summarize his family's experience in implementing the patriotic pact. After the cadres gained experience in Chen Yushan's home, they dispersed to various groups in the village, gathered active members of each family to study, and selected typical families to establish patriotic pacts first, and then promoted them to the whole village. In this way, the active members of each household in the village were educated, and everyone held family meetings and made good patriotic pacts. In this way, Chen Yushan's method of making patriotic pacts was quickly promoted to the whole township.

In mid-August, at the Second Nanchong City People's Congress to Resist America and Aid Korea, Chen Yushan attended and made a typical report on the establishment and implementation of the patriotic pact. All the representatives unanimously believed that Chen Yushan's family patriotic pact was a model worthy of learning by the people of the city, and proposed to carry out the "Chen Yushan Movement" to promote the continued progress of the city's Resist America and Aid Korea movement. Chen Yushan's family patriotic pact spread throughout Nanchong City. Han Changsong, a farmer from Xinjian Township, said: "My family patriotic pact was not well made, it only said that I would do a good job in farming. After reading Chen Yushan's pact, I am determined to learn from him. I also guarantee that within three months, I will cultivate the paddy fields with three plows and three harrows."

    川北南充市推广陈玉山家庭的爱国公约
    十月初，川北南充市举行的爱国公约展览会上，舞凤乡农民陈玉山的家庭爱国公约引起了很多人的注意。陈玉山的家庭爱国公约是在四月份订立的，六月份曾修订一次。订约时经过了全家的民主讨论，每个人都订出了自己的工作计划，来保证家庭爱国公约的实现。执行中，全家定期召开家庭会议来进行检查，并采取增产竞赛、奖励批评的办法，鼓励全家进步。在爱国公约的推动下，全家出现了前所未有的欢乐与向上的气象。三十几挑田都做到了四犁四耙、精耕细作，上粪比去年多了将近三分之一。每挑田比往年多打了一斗五升粮食。大儿子陈世春因为工作积极，不独完成了自己的计划，还帮助军属做了几天活，全家曾讨论通过奖给他一套衣服。老二陈世鑫也和哥哥展开了竞赛。大媳妇邓素清低着头使劲干，为了完成自己的每天拣粪十斤、割草五背箩的计划，每天天刚亮就起床工作。从前家里养不起牲畜，今年圈子里有了三只摇头摆尾的大猪和两只小猪。十只肥嫩的小鸡在园子里窜来窜去。全家过去没有一个人识字，现在都参加了学习，农忙的时节也天天上夜校，连老太太都懂得了抗美援朝的道理。她说：“国保得住，家才保得住。志愿军在前方给我们打美帝国主义，当然我们要撑他们的腰杆。”全家除了保证拥护政府政策法令，保证农业税要交得快交得好之外，还在增产的基础上捐献了一只肥猪给志愿军买飞机大炮。
    陈玉山的家庭爱国公约，在全村、全乡、全市都起了带头作用。舞凤乡在发动全乡群众检查修订和补订爱国公约时，曾把第六村作为重点试验村。陈玉山家被选作典型户。全村干部都参加了陈玉山的家庭会议，看他家里怎样订立了爱国公约，订立爱国公约究竟对国家对自己有啥好处，并学习检查修订爱国公约的方法，总结了他家执行爱国公约的经验。干部们在陈玉山家取得经验后，又分散到全村各小组，召集各个家庭的积极分子进行学习，并选择典型家庭首先订好爱国公约，然后再向全村推广。这样，教育了全村各户的积极分子，大家都召开家庭会议，订好了爱国公约。这样，陈玉山订爱国公约的办法很快就推广到了全乡。
    八月中旬，在南充市第二届各界抗美援朝代表会议上，陈玉山又出席作了关于订立与执行爱国公约的典型报告。全体代表一致认为陈玉山的家庭爱国公约是值得全市人民学习的榜样，并提出开展“陈玉山运动”，来推动全市抗美援朝运动继续前进。陈玉山的家庭爱国公约传遍了南充市，新建乡农民韩长松说：“我的家庭爱国公约订得不好，只是说要做好庄稼。看了陈玉山的公约后，我决心向他看齐。我也一样保证在三个月内，把水田做到三犁三耙。”
