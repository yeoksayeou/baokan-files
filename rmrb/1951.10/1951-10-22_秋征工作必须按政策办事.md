    Autumn Grain Collection Work Must Be Handled According to Policy
    Currently, local people's governments are arranging autumn grain collection work, and some areas have already begun collecting. The vast majority of areas are strictly following the central government's regulations in arranging and carrying out the collection, which is correct. However, in some individual areas, the phenomenon of not handling autumn grain collection work according to policy has occurred. For example, although land reform has been completed in Changsha County, Hunan, the land survey and production assessment work has been done poorly. Some villages concealed 20 percent of their land; individual villages concealed as much as 50 percent; some villages have not even created burden registers to this day. In this way, Changsha County cannot implement the autumn grain collection policy of tax calculation according to rate. Many villages in the county are borrowing an average of 100 catties of grain per person based on the size of the agricultural population, and after completing the collection "task," they then evaluate and calculate, "returning the excess and compensating for the shortage." Some farmers did not know about "returning the excess and compensating for the shortage," which caused doubts. Some people delivered substandard public grain; some even adulterated the public grain with water and faked it. The Changsha Local Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this deviation and has issued an urgent instruction to correct it.
    Why did this deviation occur? This is because some cadres in the county do not yet understand that correctly implementing the agricultural tax policy can not only guarantee national fiscal revenue, but also encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production. Therefore, in the autumn grain collection work, they adopted a method of seeking convenience and acting rashly, which resulted in public dissatisfaction and affected the country's fiscal revenue and farmers' production enthusiasm.
    Chairman Mao clearly instructed in "On Economic and Financial Problems" that we should "enable peasants to calculate the amount of tax they pay according to the quantity and quality of their cultivated land. With this calculation, the peasants can calculate the proportion of their annual family income and expenditure, and they can let go of their production and increase their enthusiasm for production, ensuring increased grain production; there will be no unfairness in government tax collection." In carrying out the autumn grain collection work, as well as carrying out other work, we should unconditionally implement this brilliant instruction of Chairman Mao.

### 秋征工作必须按政策办事

    秋征工作必须按政策办事
    目前各地人民政府正在布置秋征工作，部分地区已开始征收。绝大部分地区，严格遵照中央的规定，布置与进行征收，这是对的；但也有个别地区，在秋征工作中，发生了不按政策办事的现象。例如，湖南长沙县土地改革虽已完成，但查田订产工作作的很差。有的乡瞒田百分之二十；个别乡竟达百分之五十左右；有的乡甚至至今未造负担册子。这样，长沙县就无法实行依率计征的秋征政策了。该县很多乡村，是按农业人口多寡，每人平均借征一百斤谷，在完成征收“任务”后，再评议计算，“长退短补”。有些农民不知道“长退短补”，因而发生了疑虑。有人交的公粮不合规格；有人甚至在公粮中掺水掺假。中共长沙地方委员会发现这一偏向，已发出紧急指示，加以纠正。
    为什么发生了这种偏向呢？这是因为，该县部分干部尚不了解正确贯彻农业税收政策，不仅可以保证国家财政收入，而且可以鼓励农民的生产积极性；因此，他们在秋征工作中，就采用了贪图省事而致草率从事的办法，结果引起群众不满，影响了国家的财政收入和农民的生产情绪。
    毛主席在“论经济问题与财政问题”中，曾明白指示，应当“使农民能够按照自己耕地的量与质计算交税数目。农民有了这个计算，就可计算他全年全家收支的比例，就可放手进行生产，而增加生产积极性，保证粮食的增产；政府征税时也就不发生不公平的问题了。”在进行秋征工作中，以及进行其他工作中，应该无条件地执行毛主席这一英明指示。
