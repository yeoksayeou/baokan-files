Jilin Chemical Plant No. 1 Neglects Safety Work
Causing the Accident of Worker Wang Yuwen Being Strangled by a Belt
Although Jilin Provincial Yinghua Chemical Plant No. 1 has undergone several major safety inspections, accidents continue to occur. In September, the plant still worked overtime at night (the trade union raised objections to the manager's office, but they were not accepted), resulting in a miscarriage for female employee Liu Shifang. After a fire occurred in the plant in April of this year, it was rebuilt, and the pump melting room only officially started trial operation in July. However, due to insufficient inspection, the belt on the oil pump in the pump melting room did not have a guard. When the machine was running, the belt would sometimes slip onto the live pulley on the shaft, and workers had to frequently use a stick to move it, otherwise it would affect the oil delivery. The trade union and the workers in the melting room had raised this issue with the administration several times, requesting improvements to safety equipment, but the administrative leaders of the plant consistently ignored them, resulting in the tragic accident of worker Wang Yuwen being strangled to death by a belt in the melting room. These accidents could have been avoided, but due to the serious bureaucratic style of the leading cadres, their lack of attention to safety work, their failure to adopt reasonable suggestions from the workers, and their failure to find ways to improve machine safety equipment, the state suffered unnecessary losses in manpower and materials. We believe that this work style should be corrected immediately, and we hope that the leading cadres of the plant will make a public self-criticism in the newspaper to draw attention to safety work everywhere.

    吉林化工一厂忽视保安工作
    造成皮带绞死工友王玉文事故
    吉林省营化工第一厂，虽然经过了几次保安大检查，事故仍然不断发生。在九月份，该厂晚间还加班加点（工会曾向经理科提出意见，但未被接受），造成女职员刘士芳怀孕小产事件。该厂在今年四月份发生火灾之后，曾进行重新修建，泵熔解室直至七月间才开始正式试转。但因检查不够细致，泵熔解室内上油泵子的皮带上没有?子，机器运转时，皮带有时滑到轴杠上的活轮上去，工友必须经常用棍拨动，不然即会影响送油。对这个问题，工会和熔解室工友，曾经向行政上提过数次意见，要求改进安全设备，但该厂行政领导干部一直置之不理，以致造成了熔解室工友王玉文被皮带绞死的惨痛事故。这些事故，本来都是能够避免的，但因领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，不重视保安工作，不采纳工友的合理建议，不想办法改善机器安全设备，因而给国家造成了人力物力上不应有的损失。我们觉得这种工作作风，应当立刻纠正，并希望该厂的领导干部在报纸上做公开的检讨，以引起各地对保安工作的注意。
