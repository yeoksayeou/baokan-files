    Learning from Huang Xiuying's Heroic Deeds
    After reading the article "The Revolutionary Will of the People in the Old Revolutionary Base Areas" on the third page of the People's Daily on October 14th, I was so moved by Huang Xiuying's noble qualities of unwavering perseverance and heroic unyieldingness in struggle that I shed tears of emotion.

    Huang Xiuying was a female comrade who stayed behind enemy lines to persist in the struggle when the Red Army went north to fight against the Japanese. When she was first captured by the enemy, she demonstrated infinite loyalty to the people and the Party. She was imprisoned for a month and a half and subjected to brutal beatings three times, but she did not waver in the slightest. At the time, she thought to herself: "I would rather sacrifice myself than let the revolution suffer any losses." Without having received revolutionary education and training, she would not have been so heroic and tenacious.

    I am a People's Liberation Army soldier who has not been in the service long. The heroic deeds of this strong-as-steel Huang Xiuying have educated me. I must learn well from her strong, brave, and unyielding heroic qualities, and fight even better to defend world peace.

    向黄秀英的英雄行为学习
    读了人民日报十月十四日第三版“老根据地人民的革命意志”一文后，我为黄秀英的坚持斗争英勇不屈的高贵品质，激动得流下了热泪。
    黄秀英是在红军北上抗日时留在敌后坚持斗争的一个女同志。当她第一次被敌人捉住时，她对人民、对党表现了无限的忠诚。她被关了一个半月，被吊打过三次，丝毫没有动摇。当时她自己想：“宁可自己牺牲，决不叫革命受损失。”如没有受过革命教育与锻炼，她是不会如此英勇顽强的。
    我是一个参军不久的人民战士。这位坚强得像钢铁一样的黄秀英的英雄行为教育了我。我要好好学习她的坚强、勇敢、不屈的英雄品质，更好地为保卫世界和平而战斗。
