Reply Regarding Opinions on the Ideological Content of Film Advertisements

To the Editor:

We have seen Comrade Chen Bingkun's comments in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on September 11th regarding the content of film advertisements. "The Brave People" is a Soviet color film. This film is also called an "adventure film" in the Soviet Union. Adventure films are one of the creative styles of Soviet films. When our department was drafting promotional slogans, we followed this practice and made a simple explanation of the difference between this style and the adventure films of capitalist countries in the "Picture Pages" published by our department. There are also articles introducing it in the ninth issue of "New Cinema." However, after checking the "advertising samples" we have sent out in the past, we found that sometimes words that only promote individual scenes and plots are mixed in, and the same situation occurred in the advertising slogans for "The Brave People" this time. As a result, some film publicity workers with deep-rooted old habits ignore propaganda slogans with ideological content when using advertising slogans, and publish words that suit their tastes in isolation, or even fabricate them with old words and old viewpoints. The Beijing "The Brave People" film advertisement is an example of this.

Regarding the work of improving the ideological nature of film publicity, we began to pay attention to it at the end of last year, and instructed various places to take various measures to correct the bourgeois film publicity methods. On December 10th last year, our department compiled the readers' opinions from the People's Daily into learning materials for cadres and distributed them to film publicity workers across the country. In April this year, when our company held its first managers' meeting (the managers' meeting is a meeting of managers of our company's regional companies), it was determined that in the future film publicity policies should pay attention to the principles of simplicity, vividness, and seeking truth from facts, and eradicate extravagant and exaggerated publicity methods. Since then, some corrections have been made, but we are still far from the goal. In the future, we will continue to work hard with a spirit of responsibility to the people to eliminate the adverse effects spread by incorrect old styles.

We express our deep gratitude to Comrade Chen Bingkun for his concern for the people's film industry and film publicity work. His opinion once again reminds us that we should pay more attention to film advertising work. Especially in the aspect of assisting and supplying materials to various regions, we should be more cautious and explain clearly to avoid the abuse of inappropriate words and sentences.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    中国影片经理公司
    对应注意电影广告思想内容意见的答覆编辑同志：
    人民日报九月十一日读者来信栏陈炳堃同志对电影广告内容的意见，我们看到了。“勇敢的人”是一部苏联彩色影片。该片在苏联也是叫做“惊险影片”的，惊险影片是苏联影片创作样式之一。我处在拟写宣传广告词句时遂沿用，并在我处出版之“画页”上对此样式与资本主义国家之惊险影片的不同做了简单解释。在“新电影”第九期上也有文章介绍。但检查过去由我们发出的“广告样本”，确实有时掺入只宣扬个别场面与情节的字句，这一次“勇敢的人”广告词句中也有同样的情形。这样，就使得部分旧习气很深的影片宣传工作者们，在运用广告词句时，抛开有思想内容的宣传词句不顾，孤立地刊登适合他们口味的词句，甚或不惜用旧词句旧观点另行编造。北京“勇敢的人”电影广告即是一例。
    关于提高影片宣传的思想性的工作，我们从去年年底即已开始注意，并指示各地必须采取各种办法纠正资产阶级的电影宣传方式。我处并在去年十二月十日曾将人民日报的读者意见辑印成干部学习资料，发给全国影片宣传工作者。今年四月间我公司举行第一届经理会议时（经理会议是我公司各地区公司经理的会议），曾确定在今后影片宣传方针上应注意朴素、生动、实事求是的原则，根除铺张的夸大的宣传方式。从此，开始得到一些纠正，但离目标还差得远。今后当更以对人民负责的精神，继续努力，以求扫除不正确的旧作风所散布的不良影响。
    陈炳堃同志关怀人民电影事业，关怀影片宣传工作，我们深表感谢。他的意见再次提醒了我们，应对电影广告工作予以更大的重视。特别是在对各地区的辅助及供给材料方面，更应慎重并解释清楚，以免滥用了不适当的词句。
