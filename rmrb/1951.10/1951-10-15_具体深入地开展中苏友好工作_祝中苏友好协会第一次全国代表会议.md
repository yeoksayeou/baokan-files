   Carry Out Sino-Soviet Friendship Work Concretely and In-Depth
    ——A Congratulatory Message to the First National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    The First National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, lasting for nine days, successfully concluded on October 13. This conference initially summarized the achievements and experiences of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's work over the past two years, reviewed shortcomings in the work, proposed a new working guideline of shifting from general appeals to concrete and in-depth work, and stipulated the task of conducting internationalism and communism education among the people from a Marxist-Leninist perspective, along with its implementation methods. These significant gains of this conference will enable Sino-Soviet friendship work to embark on a new stage of deeper and more vigorous development.
    In the two years since its establishment, under the leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, with the support of all sectors of the country and the assistance of the Soviet people, and due to the active efforts of all members, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has done much beneficial work and achieved great success. The number of members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association nationwide has surged from 3.04 million last year to over 17.7 million. This vast team promoting Sino-Soviet friendship and internationalism has conducted a large-scale publicity and education campaign on Sino-Soviet friendship and introducing the Soviet Union among the broad masses of our people over the past two years. In particular, the visit of the Soviet delegation led by Fadeyev to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the visit of the Soviet youth delegation to China, and the celebration of the October Revolution Day have all created nationwide publicity and education movements. In addition, the concrete assistance of a large number of Soviet experts to China's economic and cultural construction has universally enhanced the understanding of the Soviet Union among the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life, and ideologically increased their friendship with the Soviet Union. In addition to these large-scale publicity movements, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has also carried out regular publicity and education work. For example, editing and publishing books and periodicals related to Sino-Soviet friendship, showing Soviet films and slides, organizing photo exhibitions, organizing special lectures on studying the Soviet Union, introducing Soviet literature and art and scientific achievements, and launching a movement to learn Russian, have all achieved significant results. According to the statistics of only 48 screening teams, 7,466 screenings have been conducted, with an audience of over 16 million people. Secondly, there has been extensive and frequent contact between the people of China and the Soviet Union over the past two years. The people of the two countries have exchanged delegations and conducted cultural exchange work. Our country has continuously sent workers, peasants, and cultural and educational workers to the Soviet Union to visit and study. After returning home, they reported their impressions of the Soviet Union and the experience they learned to the masses in various places to promote China's construction cause. In the past two years, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has also preliminarily introduced the revolutionary struggles and construction work of the new Chinese people to the Soviet people. At present, the headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has established close ties with 64 cultural organizations in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. With the development of various tasks, the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has rapidly expanded and developed. At present, 1,260 branches and 44,778 sub-branches have been established nationwide.
    The fundamental reason why the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has achieved such great gains in a short period of two years is that the development directions of China and the Soviet Union are consistent, and enhancing the friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union is in the greatest interest of the Chinese people and one of the greatest interests of the people of the world, and thus it has received the support of the broad masses of the people.
    However, it is still an arduous task to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship work more universally and deeply throughout the country. In the future, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should, under the leadership of local Party committees and People's Governments, closely integrate with the country's overall tasks and the central work of various places, and first of all, more effectively serve the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and national defense construction and economic construction. In order to achieve this task, it is necessary to greatly strengthen the propaganda work of Sino-Soviet friendship. The organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at all levels should regard propaganda work as their most important work, and the development of members, the expansion of organizations, and other work should all cooperate with propaganda work and effectively serve propaganda work.
    In carrying out the propaganda of Sino-Soviet friendship, first of all, we must publicize the nature of the Soviet Union as a country and society and its unwavering policy of peace, and publicize the Soviet Union's consistent policy of assisting weak and small nations. Secondly, we must publicize the Soviet Union's friendly assistance to the Chinese people at various times; explain that the great victory achieved by the Chinese people with the help of the Soviet Union and the working people of all countries in the world is of extremely significant importance to the Soviet Union and the working people of all countries in the world; and explain that the friendship between the Soviet people cultivated and educated by Lenin and Stalin and the Chinese people cultivated and educated by Chairman Mao is an internationalist friendship, and therefore a truly indestructible and great friendship. Thirdly, it is necessary to publicize the superiority of the Soviet socialist system and the unparalleled strength of the Soviet Union, and to publicize the superiority of the new democratic system of New China and the strength of New China, so that the people can recognize that China and the Soviet Union are not only just but also incredibly powerful, and recognize the great significance of consolidating and developing Sino-Soviet friendship not only for our national construction but also for defending China, Asia, and world peace, and recognize that Sino-Soviet friendship is the hope of the people of the world and one of the greatest interests of the people of the world. Fourthly, we should systematically introduce the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in industry, agriculture, culture, education, and other aspects, and introduce the life and creative labor of Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals, according to the specific conditions and needs of various localities and departments, in order to encourage the advancing will of our people. Here, it should be explained that our revolution and construction are all "learning from Russia," and the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. Only in this way can we more effectively guide the masses of our people to earnestly learn from the Soviet Union. In carrying out the above-mentioned propaganda, we should combine internationalism with patriotism well, and oppose the one-sidedness of propaganda work, such as only publicizing the Soviet Union's assistance to China without emphasizing the self-reliance of our people, only publicizing the good life of the Soviet people without publicizing their hard work, and so on. At the same time, we must also oppose the empiricist method of only publicizing the Soviet Union from minor details without systematically explaining the problem from the basics. Only in this way can we better improve the people's understanding of the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship.
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should also greatly expand its propaganda front and propaganda team. This requires vigorously developing and consolidating the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, developing a large number of new members, and establishing broader and closer ties with various people's organizations. At the same time, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of activists to become the backbone of Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda work.
    The First National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has defined a clear direction for future work. In the future, the key to implementing this guideline and improving all work lies in strengthening the leadership of Sino-Soviet friendship work, first of all, strengthening political and ideological leadership. Responsible comrades of the Party committees and People's Governments at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party should conscientiously lead and regularly care for the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, promptly give them instructions on working principles and guidelines, and equip the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various places with a certain number of relatively strong cadres. Responsible persons of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at all levels should also understand the ideological situation of the people at all times, strengthen their own political theory learning and learning of Soviet knowledge, focus on ideological leadership work, and overcome the style of work of bureaucratism. Various people's organizations should also coordinate their actions to promote the consolidation and development of Sino-Soviet friendship from all aspects. Only in this way can we guarantee the full implementation of the resolutions of this conference and the great leap forward in Sino-Soviet friendship work.

   具体深入地开展中苏友好工作
    ——祝中苏友好协会第一次全国代表会议
    历时九天的中苏友好协会第一次全国代表会议，已于十月十三日胜利闭幕。这次会议初步总结了两年来中苏友好协会工作的成绩和经验，检讨了工作中的缺点，提出了从一般号召转向具体深入的新的工作方针，规定了以马克思列宁主义的观点向人民群众进行国际主义、共产主义教育的任务及其实施办法。这次会议的这些重大收获，将使中苏友好工作走上更加深入和蓬勃开展的新阶段。
    中苏友好协会在其成立两年来的过程中，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导和关怀下，在国内各方面的支持和苏联人民的帮助下，由于全体会员的积极努力，已经做了许多有益的工作，并获得了很大的成绩。现在全国中苏友好协会会员的人数，已由去年的三百零四万人激增到一千七百余万人。这一支庞大的宣传中苏友好与国际主义的队伍，两年来已在我国广大群众中进行了极大规模的关于中苏友好和介绍苏联的宣传教育工作。特别是法捷耶夫所率领的苏联代表团的来华，庆祝斯大林的七十寿辰，中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，苏联青年代表团的来华以及庆祝十月革命节，都曾造成了全国范围的宣传教育运动，加以大批苏联专家对于中国经济文化建设事业的具体帮助，使广大的工人、农民和知识分子及其他各界人民普遍地提高了对苏联的认识，从思想上增进了对苏友好。除了这些巨大规模的宣传运动以外，中苏友好协会还进行了经常的宣传教育工作。例如编辑出版有关中苏友好的书刊，放映苏联电影和幻灯，组织图片展览会，组织学习苏联的专题讲演，介绍苏联的文艺和科学成就，开展学习俄文的运动等等，都获得了重大成绩。仅据四十八个放映队的统计，已放映了七千四百六十六场，观众达一千六百余万人。其次，两年来中苏两国人民之间有了广泛频繁的接触，两国人民互派代表团，进行了文化交流的工作，我国不断派遣工人、农民和文化教育工作者到苏联参观、学习，他们在归国以后，即分别向各地群众报告访苏观感和所学到的经验，以推进我国的建设事业。中苏友好协会两年来也曾初步地向苏联人民进行了介绍新中国人民革命斗争和建设工作。现在中苏友好协会总会和苏联及各人民民主国家的六十四个文化团体建立了密切联系。随着各项工作的开展，中苏友好协会的组织迅速扩大发展，全国现已建立一千二百六十个分会，四万四千七百七十八个支会。
    中苏友好协会的工作，在短短的两年时间内之所以有如此巨大的收获，其基本原因是中苏两国的发展方向是一致的，增进中苏两国人民的友好合作是中国人民的最大利益，也是全世界人民的最大利益之一，因而得到广大人民的支持。
    但是，在全国范围内更普遍地更深入地开展中苏友好工作，还是一个艰巨的任务。今后中苏友好协会应该在各地党委和人民政府的领导下，密切地结合着国家的总任务和各地的中心工作，首先必须更有效地为抗美援朝运动和国防建设、经济建设服务。为了实现这一任务，必须大大加强中苏友好的宣传工作。中苏友好协会的各级组织都应该以宣传工作作为自己的最主要的工作，发展会员扩大组织以及其他的工作，都应该配合宣传工作，并有效地为宣传工作服务。
    在进行中苏友好的宣传时，首先我们要宣传苏联这一国家和社会的性质及其坚持不渝的和平政策，宣传苏联一贯援助弱小民族的政策。其次，我们要宣传苏联在各个时期对中国人民的友好帮助；说明中国人民在苏联以及世界各国劳动人民帮助下取得的伟大胜利，对于苏联以及世界各国劳动人民都有极其重大的意义；说明在列宁、斯大林培养教导下的苏联人民和在毛主席培养教导下的中国人民之间的友谊，乃是国际主义的友谊，因此是真正不可摧毁的伟大的友谊。第三，要宣传苏联社会主义制度的优越性以及苏联的无比强大，宣传新中国新民主主义制度的优越性，以及新中国力量的强大，从而使人民群众认识中苏两国不仅是正义的，而且是强大无比的，认识巩固与发展中苏友谊不仅对我们的国家建设而且对保卫中国、亚洲以及世界和平的伟大意义，认识中苏友谊乃是世界人民的希望，乃是世界人民的最大利益之一。第四，我们应该按照各地方各部门的具体情况和需要，系统地介绍苏联的工业、农业、文化教育以及其他各方面的先进经验，介绍苏联工人、农民、知识分子的生活及其创造性的劳动，以鼓舞我国人民的前进意志。在这里应该说明，我们的革命和建设，都是“以俄为师”，苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。这样才能更有效地引导我国人民群众认真向苏联学习。在进行上述宣传时，我们应该把国际主义同爱国主义很好地结合起来，反对宣传工作的片面化，例如只宣传苏联对中国的帮助，而不强调我国人民的自力更生，只宣传苏联人民的美好生活，而不宣传他们如何艰苦奋斗等等。同时，我们也要反对只从细枝末节上宣传苏联，而不从基本上系统地说明问题的经验主义方法。只有这样，我们才能更好地提高人民群众对于苏联，对于中苏友好的认识。
    中苏友好协会还应该大大扩大自己的宣传阵地和宣传队伍。这就必须大力发展与巩固中苏友好协会的组织，大量发展新的会员，并和各人民团体取得更加广泛和密切的联系。同时应该大量培养积极分子，使之成为中苏友好宣传工作中的骨干。
    中苏友好协会第一次全国代表会议已经给今后的工作确定了明确的方针。今后贯彻执行这一方针，以改进全部工作的关键在于加强对中苏友好工作的领导，首先是加强政治的和思想的领导。中国共产党的各级党委和各级人民政府的负责同志，应该切实领导和经常关心中苏友好协会的工作，及时地给他们以关于工作方针和原则的指示，并为各地中苏友好协会配备一定数量的比较坚强的干部。各级中苏友好协会负责人更应随时了解人民群众的思想情况，加强自己的政治理论学习和对于苏联知识的学习，着重思想领导工作，克服事务主义的作风。各人民团体亦应协同动作，从各方面来促进中苏友好的巩固与发展。这样才能保证这次会议的决议的全部贯彻，中苏友好工作的大踏步前进。
