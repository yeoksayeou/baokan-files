    Art Workers Should Seriously Create Portraits of Leaders

    According to readers Du Kejing, Li Chaoxiang, and Long Zhongtang, many portraits of Chairman Mao and other revolutionary leaders in current pictorials, periodicals, and publications are not very similar to the actual persons. For example, the portraits of Chairman Mao in the "Henan Pictorial" (inaugural issue), the cover of the 29th issue of "Good Children" edited by the "Good Children Magazine" and distributed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore, the 6th issue of the "New Children's Pictorial" published by the Shanghai New Children's Bookstore, and the first issue of "Jilin Pictorial," etc., are all poorly drawn. It is even more inappropriate for "Hunan Youth" (newspaper) in its 85th issue to use a portrait of Chairman Mao as a small masthead.

    The same situation exists with portraits of the world's revolutionary teachers, Marx and Stalin. For example, in the book "Applied Patterns and Art Fonts" compiled by Zhang Weizhen and printed by Shanghai Wanye Bookstore, Marx and Stalin are drawn very badly (the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on this book are also poorly drawn). The portrait of Stalin in the inaugural issue of "Henan Pictorial" is also badly drawn.

    This phenomenon shows that the editors of these pictorials, periodicals, and books do not have a sufficient understanding that publishing portraits of revolutionary leaders is a serious political task.

    It should be said that it is encouraging to depict the image of the leaders in various newspapers and periodicals to meet the needs of the masses. For some local pictorials, due to the limited level of the artists, excessively harsh demands should not be made at present; however, artists should be required to draw the portraits of leaders as similarly as possible. In fact, some portraits in some publications could be drawn more exquisitely, but the authors have adopted a perfunctory attitude, which is very inappropriate. To draw the portrait of our people's leader Chairman Mao correctly and solemnly is an important task of patriotic propaganda. It is hoped that the editors of the above-mentioned periodicals and pictorials will correct the past mistakes in their future work. Art workers should also cultivate a serious creative attitude and draw the correct image of the people's leaders.

### 美术工作者应该严肃地创作领袖像

    美术工作者应该严肃地创作领袖像
    据读者杜克静、李朝襄、龙中唐反映，目前有些画报、刊物和出版物上的毛主席和其它革命领袖的画像，都画得十分不像。例如，“河南画报”（创刊号）、东北新华书店发行、由“好孩子杂志社”编辑的“好孩子”二十九期封面、上海新儿童书店出版的“新儿童画报”六期、“吉林画报”第一期等等中的毛主席像，都画得不好。“湖南青年”（报纸）八十五期竟用毛主席像当作小报头使用，更不应该。
    对于世界革命导师马克思、斯大林的画像也有如上所述的情形。例如上海万叶书店印行、张维振编的“应用图案及美术字”一书中，就把马克思和斯大林画得非常难看（这本书上的毛主席和朱总司令像画得也很不好）。“河南画报”创刊号的斯大林像也画坏了。
    这种现象表明，这些画刊、刊物、书籍的编者，对于刊登革命领袖像是一个严肃的政治任务，没有足够的认识。
    应该说，在各种各样的报刊中来表现领袖的形象，以满足群众的要求，是值得鼓励的。对于某些地方画刊，因为限于作画者的水平，在目前也还不应有过苛的要求；但应该要求画家们画领袖像时尽可能画得像些。事实上，有的刊物中的画像，是可以画得精致些的，但作者采取了草率的态度，这是很不应该的。把我国人民领袖毛主席的像画得正确、庄严是爱国主义宣传的重要任务。希望上述刊物和画报的编者，在今后工作中改正过去的错误。美术工作者也应同样地培养严肃的创作态度，画出人民领袖的正确形象来。
