    Our Gains from Organizing a Film Discussion on "The White Haired Girl"
    To the Editor:
    On September 20th, our Fifth Police Station of the Third Internal Division of the Public Security Bureau collectively watched the movie "The White Haired Girl." We couldn't help but shed tears at the touching parts. One comrade's eyes were red from crying. After watching it, everyone felt they had a lot to say, so we organized a discussion meeting to let everyone talk freely about their feelings after watching the movie. The discussion was very lively, and the mood was high. Through this discussion meeting, the comrades felt that they had a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the ideological content of the movie "The White Haired Girl," and felt that this kind of discussion meeting was as meaningful as a political lesson.
    Fifth Police Station of the Third Internal Division of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, Wan Min

    我们组织“白毛女”影片座谈会的收获编辑同志：
    九月二十日下午，我们公安内三分局第五派出所，集体去看电影“白毛女”，看到感动人的地方，都情不自禁地掉了眼泪。有一个同志的眼睛都哭红了。看完回来，大家都感到心里有许多话要说，于是我们组织了一个座谈会，让大家来漫谈各人看电影后的感想。会上发言很热烈，情绪很高。通过这次座谈会，同志们感到对电影“白毛女”的思想内容有了较深刻、全面的认识，觉得这样的座谈会和上一次政治课一样有意义。
    北京公安内三分局第五派出所  万敏
