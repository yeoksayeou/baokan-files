    China's Railway Workers' Union, Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, and Medical Workers' Union, etc.
    Voice Support for the Struggle of the Innocent Defendants in Japan's "Matsukawa Incident"
    [From our newspaper] Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Railway Workers' Union, sent a telegram to all the workers victimized in the "Matsukawa Incident" in Japan, voicing support for their just struggle in the "second trial." The telegram reads as follows: To the Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Association and to all the worker brothers victimized in the "Matsukawa Incident":
    All Chinese railway workers are closely concerned about the progress of the "Matsukawa Incident" second trial and resolutely support your struggle with all our strength. You are outstanding examples of Japanese patriotic workers. Your struggle is an important part of striving for Japanese democracy, independence, freedom, and world peace. We wish you victory.
        Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Railway Workers' Union
        October 18, 1951
    [From our newspaper] All members of the Trade Union of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government wrote a letter to Saito Chi and all the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" in Japan, resolutely supporting their just struggle. The letter stated that Chinese railway workers are paying close attention to the evolution and development of the "Matsukawa Incident" and express their highest respect for the spirit of resolute struggle of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."
    The letter introduced the struggle experience of Chinese railway workers, saying: "In the struggle against imperialism and feudalism, Chinese railway workers, like you, were also subjected to the slaughter and persecution by reactionary forces. The famous 'February 7th Massacre' is a glorious page in history written in blood by our advanced railway workers. But under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we finally defeated the ferocious enemy. Zhao Jixian, the culprit of the 'February 7th Massacre,' was finally brought to justice by the people, and blood was paid with blood. This fact proves that truth will surely prevail, and the people are the ultimate judge."
    The letter stated that in the Korean War, the Chinese and Korean People's forces weakened the aggressive arrogance of U.S. imperialism through their incomparably heroic struggle. A patriotic production competition movement is being widely launched in China. In this movement, countless advanced workers have emerged in the railway system, which has universally improved production. This movement has strengthened the forces for defending world peace.
    The letter concluded by saying that Chinese railway workers resolutely support the just struggle of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."
    [From our newspaper] The National Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Japan Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union on the 18th of this month, voicing support for the struggle of the innocent arrestees in the "Matsukawa Incident" in Japan to demand their release, and expressing condolences to the innocent arrestees Suzuki Shin and their families. The National Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union also sent a telegram to the Japanese Yoshida Cabinet and the Sendai High Court of Japan, protesting the illegal fabrication of the "Matsukawa Incident," demanding the revocation of the unfair judgments against the innocent arrestees Suzuki Shin and others, and demanding their immediate release.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth] The Working Committee of the Chinese Medical Workers' Union recently sent a telegram to the Japan Railway Workers' Union to be forwarded to the defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident," expressing their warm support and condolences to them. The telegram stated that Chinese medical workers, "in addition to demanding that the Yoshida government and the judges of the Sendai High Court revoke their unreasonable judgments against you and immediately release you from prison, extend our cordial condolences to you and resolutely support your just struggle."
    At the same time, the Working Committee sent telegrams to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and the Sendai High Court, protesting their persecution of Japanese workers under the pretext of the Matsukawa train derailment incident, and demanding the immediate revocation of the previous unreasonable judgments against the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and the prompt release of the twenty innocent defendants.

    声援日本“松川事件”无辜被告的斗争
    【本报讯】中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯致电日本“松川事件”被难全体工人，声援他们将在“第二审”中所进行的正义斗争。电文如下：日本劳农救援会并转“松川事件”被难全体工人兄弟们：
    中国全体铁路工人密切关怀着“松川事件”第二审的进行并坚决以全力支援你们的斗争。你们是日本爱国工人的优秀榜样。你们的斗争是争取日本民主、独立、自由与世界和平重要的一部分。祝你们胜利。
              中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯
                一九五一年十月十八日
    【本报讯】中央人民政府铁道部工程总局支工会全体会员写信给日本“松川事件”全体无辜被告斋藤千等，坚决支援他们的正义斗争。信中说，中国铁路工人时刻注意着“松川事件”的演变和发展，并对“松川事件”无辜被告者坚决斗争的精神表示崇高的敬意。
    信中介绍中国铁路工人的斗争经验说：“中国铁路工人在反帝、反封建的斗争中，也同你们一样受到反动势力的屠杀和迫害，有名的‘二七惨案’就是我们先进的铁路工人用鲜血写成的一页辉煌的历史。但我们在英明的领袖毛主席和中国共产党领导下，终于战胜了凶恶的敌人。‘二七惨案’的罪魁赵继贤终于受到了人民最后的裁判，血债血还了。这段事实证明：真理一定能获得胜利，人民才是最后的裁判者。”
    信中说，在朝鲜战争中，中朝人民部队以无比英勇的斗争削弱了美帝国主义的侵略气焰。中国国内正普遍地展开了爱国主义生产竞赛运动。在这个运动中，铁路系统中曾涌现了无数的先进工作者，使生产普遍提高一步。这个运动壮大了保卫世界和平的力量。
    这封信最后说，中国铁路工人坚决支援“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争。
    【本报讯】中国邮电工会全国委员会于本月十八日致电日本邮电工会中央委员会，声援日本“松川事件”无辜被捕者要求释放的斗争，并对无辜被捕者铃木信等及其家属表示慰问。邮电工会全国委员会并电日本吉田内阁和日本仙台高等裁判所，抗议非法制造“松川事件”，要求撤销对无辜被捕者铃木信等的不公正的裁判，并立即释放他们。
    【新华社十八日讯】中国医务工会工作委员会最近发给日本铁路工会转给“松川事件”被告的电报一件，对他们表示热烈的支援与慰问。电文中说：中国医务工作者“除要求吉田政府及仙台高等裁判所审判官撤销对你们的无理判决并立即释放你们出狱外，特向你们致以亲切的慰问，并坚决支援你们的正义斗争”。
    该工作委员会同时致电日本首相吉田茂及仙台高等裁判所，抗议他们借口松川列车颠覆事件对日本工人的迫害行为，并要求立即撤销以前对“松川事件”被告的无理判决，迅速释放二十名无辜被告。
