    Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," reported from Panmunjom, Kaesong, on the 16th: The Korean-Chinese liaison officers today suggested that no hostile acts should be carried out within a radius of five miles around Munsan and one and a half miles on both sides of the Munsan-Panmunjom road to ensure the safety of the delegations. In this way, they exposed another American lie about what was hindering the resumption of negotiations. The US side suggested a few days ago that the area within a radius of three thousand yards around Munsan should be "immune from attack." The Korean and Chinese sides agreed to this suggestion. The US side then demanded that the Kaesong Neutral Zone should be reduced to a radius of three thousand yards, and its status should be changed to "immune from attack" - meaning the cancellation of the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement. However, the US side published fabricated lies saying that the Korean and Chinese sides had made suggestions regarding the three thousand-yard area around Munsan, but that the Korean and Chinese sides refused to reduce their area to the same size. Today's proposal eliminates this lie and gives the US side equality. But they refused again and put forward the old proposal to reduce the five-mile radius of the Kaesong district to three thousand yards. Military observers here pointed out that pilots flying around the edge of such a small circle would definitely be circling the inside. American journalists themselves have stated that Kaesong is within the range of heavy naval artillery. Such an area cannot guarantee the safety of the delegation, and the delegation has already been bombed and shot at even within a five-mile radius. Another fact also shows that the United States is actually only concerned with undermining the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement. This fact is that Ridgway's initial proposal was to delineate a large neutral zone in order to restrict the Korean and Chinese sides. Now he is asking for a small neutral zone in order to avoid restricting the Americans. Ridgway's tenacious efforts to establish a smaller neutral zone and turn it into just an area "immune from attack" prove that he is not concerned (or worse) about the safety of the Korean and Chinese delegations and has no sincerity in the negotiations. Ten minutes after the meeting started today, two Navy Sea Otter jet planes flew almost directly over the meeting tent. United Nations reporters immediately recognized the two planes because they were flying at an altitude of only about 1,500 feet.
    The Korean-Chinese proposal to establish corridors of one and a half miles on both sides of the Munsan-Panmunjom road is also necessary because the range of heavy machine guns is more than one mile. The US side said: "We ask for less, so you must also have less." This statement is useless. The Korean and Chinese sides have never shot at or bombed the US delegation, nor have they sent hundreds of planes to fly over Munsan. The US side is guilty, and now they intend to complain, like a convicted criminal, that no one believes him. Their sincerity still needs to be proven, and they cannot be believed until it is proven.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th: French "Ce Soir" reporter Philippe Baechtold reported from Panmunjom, Kaesong, on the 17th: The reason why the US side is delaying indefinitely and adopting deliberately obstructive tactics became clearer here this morning. Reporters who had just arrived here from Tokyo told me that powerful groups at Ridgway's headquarters oppose stopping the Korean War. They want the war to continue in order to "keep the Chinese army tied down in Korea." A few first-class reporters have been notified of this and are gradually preparing public opinion for the continuation of the war.

    揭露李奇微阴谋取消开城中立化协定
    美方记者透露李奇微总部蓄意继续进行侵朝战争
    【新华社十七日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿十六日自开城板门店报道：朝中联络官今天建议在汶山周围半径五哩及汶山、板门店通道两侧各一哩半的地区内不进行敌对行为，以保证代表团的安全。这样，他们就揭穿了美方又一宗关于什么东西阻挠恢复谈判的谎言。美方数天前建议汶山周围半径三千码以内的地区应“免受攻击”。朝中方面同意了这个建议。美方然后又要求开城中立区的范围应缩小为半径三千码，它的地位改为“免受攻击”——意思就是要取消关于开城的中立化协定。可是，美方发表捏造的谎言说，朝中方面提出了关于汶山周围三千码地区的建议，而朝中方面却又拒绝把自己的地区缩小为同样大小的地区。今天的建议消除了这个谎言，并给美方以平等。但他们却再度拒绝，而提出了把开城区的五哩半径缩小为三千码的旧建议。此间军事观察家指出，在这样一个小圆圈的周围边上飞行的驾驶员一定会打着圆圈内部。美国记者自己也声言，开城在海军重炮射程之内。这样一个地区是不能保证代表团的安全的，代表团甚至在半径五哩的圆圈内都已经遭到轰炸和射击了。另有一桩事实也说明美国实际上只关心破坏开城中立区协定。这事实就是，李奇微最初的建议是要求划一个大的中立区，以便限制朝中方面。现在他又要求划一个小中立区，以便避免限制美国人。李奇微顽强地力争建立较小的中立区并把它变为只是“免受攻击”的地区，证明他不关心（或者更坏）朝中方面代表团的安全，并且对于谈判没有诚意。今天在会议开始后十分钟，两架海军海豹式喷气飞机几乎就在会议帐篷上面飞过。联合国记者马上认出这两架飞机来，因为它们只在一千五百呎左右高空飞行。
    朝中方面建议在汶山、板门店通道两侧各一哩半建立走廊同样是必要的，因为重机枪的射程为一哩多。美方说：“我们要求比较少，因此你们也必须要少一些。”这种说法是无用的。朝中方面从未射击和轰炸美方的代表团，也未派成百架的飞机到汶山上空飞行。美方是有罪的，他们现在却又打算像已被定罪的犯人一样，抱怨没有人相信他。他们的诚意还需要证明，在证明以前是不能相信他们的。
    【新华社十七日讯】法国今晚报记者贝却敌十七日自开城板门店报道：美方无限期地拖延并采用蓄意阻挠的策略，其原因何在，今晨在此间更加明显了。刚从东京抵达此间的记者们告诉我说，李奇微总部有势力的集团反对停止朝鲜战争。他们要战争继续下去，以便“把中国军队牵制在朝鲜”。关于这一点少数第一流的记者已得到通知，为继续进行战争逐渐准备舆论。
