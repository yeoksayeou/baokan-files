    Learning from the Patriotic Spirit of the Working Class
    Further Developing the Patriotic Production Increase Movement
    National Model Agricultural Laborer Li Shunda
    This is my second time coming to Beijing and Tianjin to meet with the worker elders. Compared to last year, my feeling is that the mutual assistance between urban and rural areas is getting closer year by year, and the solidarity between workers and peasants is getting more intimate year by year. When we got off the train in Tianjin, the flowers presented by workers, students, and citizens could bury us; every time we visited a factory, the worker comrades would run and smile as they lifted us up; I stayed in Tianjin for four days and was lifted up by worker comrades more than ten times. Wherever we visited, worker comrades accompanied us, either talking about patriotic production or exchanging signatures. Li Runsheng, a worker from the Tianjin Lan Shunxing Stationery Factory, voluntarily accompanied us to visit the exhibition hall for a day, earnestly asking us to sign each other’s names; but because there were too many people voluntarily accompanying us, and everyone signing would affect the visit, he didn't succeed until it was almost dark; he stubbornly squeezed through the crowd to me, asked for our address, and left. The next day, as soon as it was light, we had just gotten up when he came, moving us to tears. We invited him into the house and had a friendly chat, and finally signed each other's names on our notebooks before he left contentedly. He was still reluctant to leave, and we agreed to meet again next year. Another thing that moved me was the entire student body of Tianjin No. 8 Elementary School. When they heard that I was visiting Tianjin, they specially ordered two sickles for me from a farm tool factory. As soon as we arrived in Tianjin, they lined up and shouted slogans: "Welcome peasant uncles to produce more grain and cotton for the motherland!" I accepted their gifts and gave them a speech. Finally, they brought a piece of red cloth and asked me to write on it before happily singing and dancing back to school. These two things alone show that in our new country under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people are infinitely closer than families in the old society.

    This time I came to the city mainly to learn skills from the worker elders, so as to improve our agricultural production. There are many things I want to learn, but the most important thing is to apply the patriotic spirit of the working class to our agricultural production. After visiting the factories, I realized that the working class has a greater patriotic spirit than us, the patriotic production movement is also higher than us, and the production achievements are even greater than us. For example, when all the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant heard the chairman of the trade union report in May this year that our volunteers on the Korean battlefield urgently needed planes and cannons, all the workers in the factory were immediately stirred up. Some said: "I want to donate my entire month's salary to buy planes and cannons." Others said: "We want to work overtime to increase production and buy planes and cannons." The more specific the discussion became, the more specific production and savings targets were set by all departments of the factory, and a vigorous patriotic production movement was launched throughout the factory. Looking back at our patriotic production increase movement in the countryside, it is not as good as the patriotic production movement of the working class. Although we have strived for a bumper harvest this year under the promotion of the patriotic production increase movement, our patriotic enthusiasm is still not as great as the workers; the patriotic production increase movement is not deep and extensive enough; and the production achievements are not as great as the workers. For example, our Xigou Village with fifty households has only donated 1.12 million yuan in Renminbi, and even if all the annual production achievements are added together, plus ten Xigou Villages as big as ours, we still cannot buy a plane. I am not saying that a small mountain village like ours must buy a plane to be considered patriotic, but I mean that we peasants should learn from the patriotic spirit of the working class, further develop our patriotic production increase movement in agricultural production, and produce more grain and cotton to support our People's Volunteers and supply the worker elders with raw materials for production. From now on, I must first do a good job in autumn plowing and autumn planting, actively prepare for winter production, and lay a favorable foundation for launching a national production increase movement next year.

    学习工人阶级的爱国精神
    进一步开展爱国丰产运动
    全国农业劳动模范  李顺达
    我是第二次到北京、天津来和工人老大哥见面。今年和去年相比，我的感觉是：城乡互助一年比一年更密切，工农团结一年比一年更亲密了。到天津一下火车，工人、学生、市民送的鲜花能把我们埋起来；我们每到一个工厂参观，工人同志就跑着笑着把我们抬起来；我在天津住了四天，就被工人同志抬了十几次。我们每到一处参观，都有工人同志随着，不是谈爱国生产，就是互相签名。天津蓝顺兴文具厂工人李润生，他自动和我们在展览馆里参观了一天，一心要求我们互相签个名；可是因为自动和我们相随的人太多，大家都签名，就会影响参观，结果到天快黑了，还是没有签成；他就硬从人堆里挤到我跟前，问清我们的住址，他就走了。到第二天天刚明，我们刚起床，他就找来了，感动的我们眼里都流出了泪。我们把他请到屋里，彼此亲热地漫谈了一顿，最后互相在本子上签了名，他才心满意足地出门走了。走时还恋恋不舍，互相约定明年再见。还有一件使我感动的事，就是天津市第八小学全体学生。他们听说我来天津参观，特别到农具工厂给我订买了两把镰刀。当我们刚到天津，他们就排着队喊着口号：“欢迎农民伯伯们给祖国多生产粮棉。”我接受了他们的礼物，又给他们讲了话。最后，他们拿来一块红布，叫我写上字，才高高兴兴地唱着跳着回学校了。就这两件事，也说明了在毛主席领导下，我们的新国家里的人民，比过去旧社会的家庭，不知道要亲密多少倍。
    这回我到城里来，主要是向工人老大哥学习本事，好改进我们的农业生产。我要学习的东西很多，最重要的是要把工人阶级爱国精神，运用到我们的农业生产里去。参观工厂后，我认识到工人阶级的爱国精神比我们大，爱国生产运动也比我们高，生产的成绩更比我们多。像石景山钢铁厂全体工人，在今年五月时，听到工会主席报告：我们的志愿军在朝鲜战场上急需要飞机大炮，全场工人马上就轰动起来。有的说：“我要把全月薪金捐出买飞机大炮。”有的说：“我们要加时加班增加生产，买飞机大炮。”越讨论越具体，最后全工厂各部门都订出了具体的生产节约数字，轰轰烈烈的爱国生产运动就在全工厂开展起来了。回想起我们农村的爱国丰产运动，还不如工人阶级的爱国生产运动。今年我们虽然在爱国丰产运动的推动下，争取了丰收，可是我们的爱国劲头还是没有工人大；爱国丰产运动也不够深入广泛；生产的成绩也没工人多。像我们西沟村五十户人家，才捐献人民币一百一十二万元，就是把全年生产成绩都算到一起，再加上十个像我们那样大的西沟村，也买不下一架飞机。我这么谈，并不是说像我们那样一个小山村
    一定要买架飞机才算是爱国，我的意思是说，我们农民要学习工人阶级的爱国精神，进一步开展我们农业生产中的爱国丰产运动，生产出更多的粮食和棉花，支援我们人民志愿军，供给工人老大哥生产原料。从现在起，我先要做好秋耕、秋种工作，积极准备开展冬季生产，给明年开展全国丰产运动打下有利的基础。
