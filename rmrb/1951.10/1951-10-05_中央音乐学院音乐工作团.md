    Central Conservatory of Music Music Work Group
    A Letter to Ehrenburg and Neruda to Express Respect
    Respected Mr. Ehrenburg and Mr. Neruda:
    We are writing to you with extremely excited and happy feelings: On September 24th, we held a small recitation evening to celebrate Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling receiving the award and to welcome Mr. Ehrenburg and Mr. Neruda to Beijing. Here—in the rehearsal room of our music work group—hung a green curtain with a painting of a peace dove above it, surrounded by slogans. The room was packed. We listened quietly to the news about you coming to China to carry out glorious missions. The comrades who gave the reports spoke about your life stories. Some comrades recited your most beautiful and brilliant poems and essays. While listening, everyone felt that they gained even greater insight than when they read your poems and essays on ordinary days. Those sharp and brilliant words controlled our breathing so much. Truly, respected Mr. Ehrenburg and Mr. Neruda, we seemed to feel that you were already present at our evening party, talking and laughing with us. Two figures appeared before our eyes—the images of you, the great peace warriors.
    How honored and happy we were! That day's newspaper—reporting the news of your arrival in Beijing—added an infinite color of joy to the faces of every comrade, and everyone passed on this joyful news to each other. Normally, we are so far apart that we can only learn about your poems and political essays from newspapers and magazines. How powerfully these have inspired our hatred for the enemy and our determination to fight to the end for the cause of peace! We know that you are the closest comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people. You have given us great concern, support, and encouragement on the road of the Chinese people's struggle, and today we can see you and hear your voices!
    We warmly cheer you, dear teachers and friends. At today's evening party, we once again encourage ourselves, and also our comrades, to learn from your example, to be brave, tenacious, and unyielding, and to use our musical weapons to deeply carry out the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, in order to defend the lasting peace of mankind!
    To you, we extend
    the most respectful and affectionate revolutionary salute
    Music Work Group of the Central Conservatory of Music and the Secretariat of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Branch in the Music Work Group, the Education Trade Union Committee, the Political Study Committee, and the Communist Youth League Branch

    中央音乐学院音乐工作团
    写信向爱伦堡聂鲁达致敬敬爱的爱伦堡聂鲁达先生：
    我们以极兴奋愉快的心情告诉你们：九月二十四日我们开了一个小型的朗诵晚会，来庆祝宋庆龄副主席受奖，和欢迎爱伦堡、聂鲁达先生来到北京。在这里——我们音乐工作团的排练室里，挂了一幅绿色幕布，上面悬挂了一幅和平鸽的画，四周贴满了标语，屋子里的人坐得满满的。我们静听着关于你们来中国执行光荣任务的消息。报告的同志报告了关于你们的生平事迹。有的同志朗诵了你们最优美最光辉的诗文。在听的时候，每个人都感到比平日阅读你们的诗文时，获得更大的感受。那些锋利的、灿烂的词句是这样地控制了我们的呼吸，真的，敬爱的爱伦堡先生、聂鲁达先生，我们仿佛觉得你们已经莅临在我们的晚会上了，跟我们在一起谈笑了。我们眼前浮现出两个面影——你们伟大和平战士的形象。
    我们是多么感到光荣和高兴啊，那天的报纸——登载着你们来京的消息——使每个同志的脸上增加了无限欢欣的色彩，大家把这喜悦的消息互相传送。在平常，我们相隔那样远，只能从报章杂志上学习到你们的诗篇、政治论文，这些是多么有力地启发了我们对敌人的仇恨和为和平事业奋斗到底的决心啊！我们知道，你们是我们中国人民最亲密的战友，在中国人民斗争的道路上你们给了我们极大的关心、支持和鼓舞，而今天能见到你们，听到你们的声音了！
    我们热情地向你们欢呼，亲爱的老师和朋友，在今天的晚会上我们再一次地砥砺自己，也砥砺同伴们，要学习你们的榜样，要英勇顽强，不屈不挠，用我们的音乐武器深入地进行抗美援朝的斗争，来保卫人类永久的和平！
    向你们致
    最尊敬最亲切的革命敬礼
