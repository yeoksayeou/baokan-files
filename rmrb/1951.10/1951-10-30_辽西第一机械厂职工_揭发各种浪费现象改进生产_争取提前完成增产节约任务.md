    Employees of Liaoxi No. 1 Machinery Factory
    Expose Various Waste Phenomena, Improve Production, and Strive to Complete Production Increase and Economy Task Ahead of Schedule

To the Editor:
    Since the entire staff of the Liaoxi No. 1 Machinery Factory responded to the call of Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government to increase production and practice economy, and launched a patriotic production competition movement, the entire factory has completed 45.37% of the production increase and economy task. In the production competition, all workshops, groups, and individuals actively exposed various wasteful phenomena, promoted advanced experience, and resolved technical problems with each other. In August, the sand casting workshop produced thirteen waste large covers, but after the workers in the workshop made rationalization proposals, the waste products were basically eliminated in September. In the riveting workshop, Liu Yanxi's group used to only be able to burn one ball mill curved beam at a time because the furnace bottom was small. After the group studied and widened the furnace bottom, they can now burn two at a time. This not only saved more than 800 catties of coke but also completed the production task seven days ahead of schedule. Others, such as technician Wan Yongcheng, went deep into the workshop and improved the spiral knife washing machine, which also saved the factory a lot of money. At present, all the employees of the factory are confidently striving to complete the planned production increase and economy task ahead of schedule and resolutely support the most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—to drive the American imperialists out of Korea.

                                                                                                 Guan Mingyuan

    辽西第一机械厂职工
    揭发各种浪费现象改进生产
    争取提前完成增产节约任务编辑同志：
    辽西第一机械厂全体职工，自响应东北人民政府高岗主席增产节约号召，开展爱国主义生产竞赛运动以来，全厂已完成增产节约任务百分之四十五点三七。在生产竞赛中，各车间、小组、个人都积极地揭发各种浪费现象，推广先进经验，相互解决技术问题。翻沙车间在八月份生产大盖子废品十三个，但经过该车间工人提了合理化建议后，九月份基本上已消灭了废品。铆工车间刘延喜小组过去烧球磨机弯梁时，因炉底小只能烧一根，经小组会研究把炉底放宽后，现在可以烧二根了。这样，不但节省了焦炭八百多斤，而且提前七天完成生产任务。其他如技术员万永成深入车间，改进了螺旋洗刀，也给工厂节省了很多费用。目前，全厂职工正有信心地争取提前完成预定的增产节约任务，坚决支持最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军，把美帝国主义打出朝鲜去。    关明远
