Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: The Vietnamese People's Delegation to China and the Vietnamese People's Observation Delegation, which came to our country to participate in the National Day celebrations, left Beijing by car this afternoon to visit Northeast China and other places.

Those who went to the station to see them off included Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Chen Shutong, vice chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, including Ma Xulun, Peng Zemin, Liang Xi, Shao Lizi, Cai Tingkai, Xing Xiping, Liu Ningyi, Zeng Xianzhi, Qian Sanqiang, Rong Gaotang, Shakov, Yu Xinqing, and Zhang Youyu, totaling more than 60 people.

Hoang Van Hoan, Ambassador-level Representative of the Vietnamese Delegation to China, also went to the station to see them off.

Before the delegation's departure, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference hosted a farewell banquet at noon on the 7th and a reception in the evening.

Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: Hoang Quoc Viet, leader of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China, spoke to a reporter from this agency today about his own and the delegation members' impressions of visiting Beijing. He first said: The various things in Beijing that are changing every day are of great interest to us. We left Beijing for Korea in August this year, and we returned to Beijing from Korea at the end of September. In Tiananmen Square and many of the streets we passed, we saw many new constructions. Many new buildings appeared before our eyes. Leader Hoang then expressed his admiration for the achievements and progress made by the Chinese people in the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He said: The brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in these movements demonstrate the great strength of the People's Republic of China. This strength was also clearly demonstrated in this year's National Day celebrations. We saw the People's Liberation Army equipped with the latest weapons, and we saw the grand parade of more than 400,000 people. And beside these new things, we also saw some ancient and magnificent buildings. Those things created by the people's blood, sweat, and wisdom, but which in the past were monopolized by a few exploiters, have now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, returned to the hands of the broad masses of the people.

Leader Hoang finally said: Just as Mr. Guo Moruo said, the People's Republic of China is a very young and very old country. China's old age is the foundation of the entire Asian civilization since ancient times; China's youth and strength are the mainstay of Asian peace today. We lived in Beijing for a month, and being able to see these things has further convinced us of the brilliant future of China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and has given us more confidence in the Vietnamese resistance war under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, as well as in the world peace cause under the leadership of Marshal Stalin.

    越访华代表团及观礼代表团昨赴东北等地参观
    黄国越团长谈在北京的观感
    【新华社八日讯】越南人民访华代表团及前来我国参加国庆节庆典的越南人民观礼代表团，在今日下午乘车离开北京，前往东北等地参观。
    前往车站欢送的有：中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、陈叔通，各民主党派、人民团体的代表马叙伦、彭泽民、梁希、邵力子、蔡廷锴、邢西萍、刘宁一、曾宪植、钱三强、荣高棠、沙可夫、余心清、张友渔等六十余人。
    越南驻华代表团大使衔代表黄文欢也到车站欢送。
    在代表团行前，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会曾在七日中午设宴欢送，当晚并举行晚会招待。
   【新华社八日讯】越南人民访华代表团团长黄国越今日在接见本社记者时，谈到他本人和代表团团员们在访问北京期间的观感。他首先说：北京市每天在改变着的各种事物，使我们感到极大的兴趣。今年八月间，我们离开北京到朝鲜，九月末，我们从朝鲜回到北京。在天安门前以及许多我们所经过的街道，我们看到有许多新的修建。不少新的大厦，出现在我们的眼前。黄团长接着对中国人民在抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命的三大运动中所获得的成绩与进步，表示敬佩。他说：中国人民在这些运动中所获得的辉煌成绩，显示了中华人民共和国伟大的力量。这种力量也明显地表现在今年的国庆庆典中。我们看到了装备着最新式武器的人民解放军，看到了四十余万人民群众的大游行。而在这些新事物的旁边，我们又看到一些古代壮丽的建筑。那些由人民的血汗和才智创造出来的但在过去被少数剥削者独占的东西，现在靠着毛主席的领导，又回到广大人民的手中来了。
    黄团长最后说：正如郭沫若先生所说的一样，中华人民共和国是一个很年轻而又很老的国家，中国的老正是自古以来整个亚洲文明的基础；中国的年轻壮大，正是目前亚洲和平的中坚力量。我们在北京生活一个月，能够看到这些事情，更使我们相信毛主席领导下的中国的辉煌前途，更使我们对在胡志明主席领导下的越南抗战以及对在斯大林大元帅领导下的世界和平事业，有了必胜的信心。
