    Bureaucrats Mistake Bad Elements for Model Workers

    In the selection of labor models in Gaiping County, Liaodong Province, due to the serious bureaucratic style of the county's leading cadres, a bad element named Ci Deyi, with extremely poor political quality, reactionary thinking, and hated by the masses, was "selected" as a special-class cotton planting model for the entire county and a first-class cotton planting model for the entire province. He was even introduced to join the Party.

    During the puppet Manchukuo period, Ci Deyi was rewarded by the Japanese invaders; during the land reform, he tipped off the landlords, sabotaged the land reform, and bullied women. After Ci Deyi was "elected" as a cotton planting model for the entire province, he showed off to the masses, saying, "I, Ci Deyi, drink and eat at the same table with the provincial chairman!" "The county magistrate has me, Ci Deyi, in his mind!" In fact, Ci Deyi's so-called cotton planting model was just that he specially prepared four mu of "showcase land" specifically for government cadres to visit. During the tense summer hoeing season this year, Ci Deyi hired more than sixty short-term laborers to hoe his land, while he did not participate in production. When building his house, he mobilized ten carts and more than two hundred laborers from the masses to haul stones and bricks for him. After the new house was built, he held ninety-eight tables of banquets, inviting people to eat and drink lavishly. After the money was spent, he borrowed two thousand jin of grain from the county government. The masses had many opinions but only dared to discuss them behind his back. Ci Deyi, however, told people, "I became a labor model entirely on my own, and getting rich depends on my own ability. It's the same in any dynasty." But the bureaucrats were completely unaware of this. The Gaiping County magistrate had been to Liujia Village twice, but each time he went, he looked for Ci Deyi and would "come, ask, record, and leave."

    Of course, in this way, they could not see all of Ci Deyi's bad behavior and could not hear the various opinions of the masses. Comrade Stalin said, "If the Bolsheviks become divorced from the masses, lose contact with the masses, and become stained with the dust of bureaucracy, they will lose all strength and become empty shells." Certain leading personnel in Gaiping County are precisely these "empty shells" "stained with the dust of bureaucracy."

    Although this serious error in Gaiping County has been corrected, it has already caused great losses to the work. Therefore, the county's leadership should still conduct a thorough self-criticism, and leaders in other places should also learn from this lesson.

### 官僚主义者把坏分子当作了劳动模范

    官僚主义者把坏分子当作了劳动模范
    辽东盖平县在选拔劳动模范工作中，由于县的领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义作风，致将一个政治品质极端恶劣，思想反动，为群众所痛恨的坏分子慈德义，“选拔”为全县特等植棉模范，全省一等植棉模范。甚至还介绍他参加了党。
    慈德义在伪满时，受过日寇的奖励；土地改革时，给地主通风报信，破坏土地改革，霸占妇女。慈德义当“选”为全省植棉模范后，就向群众摆威风说：“我慈德义和省主席一个桌上喝酒吃饭！”“县长脑子里装着我慈德义！”其实慈德义的所谓植棉模范，只是他特意弄了四亩多“幌子地”，专给政府干部参观的。今年紧张的夏锄期间，慈德义雇了六十多个短工给他铲地，自己不参加生产。盖房子时，先后动员群众大车十辆，人工二百多个，给他拉石头、砖头。盖起新房子后，又办了九十八桌酒席，请人大吃大喝。钱花光后，就到县政府借了两千斤粮食。群众意见很多，只敢背后议论。慈德义却对人说：“我当劳动模范全凭自己，发家致富是凭个人的本事，什么朝代都一样。”可是官僚主义者，竟对此一无所知。盖平县长虽曾去过刘家屯两次；但一去就找慈德义，并且是“来了就问，问了就记，记了就走。”
    这样当然看不到慈德义的一切恶劣行为，听不到群众的各种意见。斯大林同志说：“布尔什维克一脱离群众，一失掉自己与群众的联系，一染上官僚主义的尘垢，就会丧失任何力量，而变成空架子。”盖平县的某些领导人员，正是这种“染上官僚主义的尘垢”的“空架子”。
    盖平县的这一严重错误，虽然已经纠正，但对工作已造成很大的损失。因此，该县领导上还应作深入检讨，其他地方的领导人员也应记取这一教训。
