Xinhua News Agency, 4th. British imperialists submitted the dispute between Iran and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to the United Nations Security Council on September 29, attempting to further interfere in Iran's internal affairs under the guise of the United Nations.

Since the breakdown of negotiations between Iran and Britain on the Iranian oil issue on August 22, Britain has used various pressures in an attempt to force Iran to abandon or amend the oil nationalization law. On September 13, the British bank stopped converting Iranian pounds into US dollars, and the British government ordered a halt to the export of certain "rare materials" to Iran. At the same time, Britain was also engaged in a conspiracy in Iran to organize opposition to the Mossadegh government, attempting to establish a government led by Iran's pro-British former Prime Minister Ala.

However, these measures by Britain have not achieved their goals. After Harriman refused to forward the Iranian government's note to Britain, the Iranian government directly suggested to Britain on September 22 that Britain should negotiate according to the conditions proposed by Iran. This proposal was rejected by the British government. On September 25, the Iranian government ordered the 350 British technicians in southern Iran to leave Iran before October 4. On September 27, Iran sent troops to guard the large refinery in Abadan, prohibiting British technicians from entering the factory.

Under the will of the Iranian people to resolutely implement oil nationalization, the British government did not dare to rashly carry out armed intervention, but turned to the United Nations for intervention. A statement issued by the British Foreign Office on September 28 said: The reason why the British government decided to submit the Iranian oil issue to the Security Council was because the Iranian government did not implement the recommendations of the International Court of Justice on July 5 on the Iranian oil issue, and the Iranian government ordered the expulsion of British technicians. Everyone knows that the Iranian government believes that the International Court of Justice's recommendations are a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Iranian people. Iranian representative Ardalán said at the Security Council meeting on October 1: The Iranian government expressed surprise at Britain's "accusation" based on the interim recommendations of the International Court of Justice, because the decision of this court was not recognized by the Iranian government, and the Security Council had no reason to discuss this case.

The US government supports Britain's "accusation" to the Security Council, believing that discussing the Iranian issue by the United Nations is more convenient for the United States to achieve its imperialist goal of plundering Iranian oil.

### 掠夺伊朗石油的又一新花样  英美图借联合国之名进一步侵犯伊朗主权

    掠夺伊朗石油的又一新花样
    英美图借联合国之名进一步侵犯伊朗主权
    【新华社四日讯】英帝国主义者已于九月二十九日把伊朗与英伊石油公司之间的争端提交联合国安全理事会，企图假借联合国之名，进一步干涉伊朗的内政。
    自八月二十二日英伊双方关于伊朗石油问题的谈判破裂以后，英国即使用种种压力，企图迫使伊朗放弃或修改石油国有化法。九月十三日，英国银行停止属于伊朗的英镑换取美元，英国政府并下令停止对伊朗输出某些“稀有物资”。同时，英国还在伊朗从事组织反对摩萨台政府的阴谋，企图建立一个由伊朗亲英派前首相艾丁领导的政府。
    但是，英国的这些措施并没有能达到目的。在哈里曼拒绝将伊朗政府的照会转交英国后，伊朗政府即于九月二十二日直接向英国建议，要求英国按照伊朗所提的条件进行谈判。这个建议遭到英国政府的拒绝。九月二十五日，伊朗政府即下令在伊朗南部的三百五十名英国技术人员在十月四日以前离开伊朗。九月二十七日，伊朗派军把守阿巴丹的大炼油厂，禁止英国技术人员进入该厂。
    在伊朗全国人民决心实行石油国有化的意志下，英国政府不敢贸然实行武装干涉，乃转而要求联合国出面干涉。英国外交部于九月二十八日发表的声明说：英国政府所以决定把伊朗石油问题提交安全理事会，是因为伊朗政府没有实行海牙国际法院七月五日对伊朗石油问题的建议和伊朗政府下令驱逐英国技术人员出境。大家都知道，伊朗政府认为国际法院的建议是对伊朗人民的主权的蛮横侵犯。伊朗代表阿特龙在十月一日的安全理事会会议上说：伊朗政府对于英国根据国际法院的临时建议提出“控诉”，表示惊奇，因为这个法院的决定并没有得到伊朗政府的承认，安全理事会也没有理由讨论这个案件。
    美国政府支持英国向安理会的“控诉”，它认为由联合国来讨论伊朗问题，更便利于美国达到它掠夺伊朗石油的帝国主义目的。
