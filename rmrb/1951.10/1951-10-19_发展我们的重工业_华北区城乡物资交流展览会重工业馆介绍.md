    Developing Our Heavy Industry
    ——Introduction to the Heavy Industry Pavilion of the North China Region's Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition
     Li Lian
    The Heavy Industry Pavilion of the North China Region's Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition systematically and with emphasis introduces the situation of heavy industry in the North China region. Here, people see the rapid development of heavy industry in North China over the past two years or so under the leadership of the People's Government, and also see the unlimited future and beautiful prospects for future development.
Significant Progress in Coal, Iron, and Steel Production
    The Heavy Industry Pavilion is divided into three sections: Mining and Metallurgy, Electrical Appliances, and Machinery. From the Mining and Metallurgy section, we see that the liberated working class has created unprecedented miracles with selfless labor. In 1950, the production volume of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine increased by 37.4 times compared to before liberation. The Ma Liu Hai group of the Datong Coal Mine created a new record by tunneling 380 meters per month, but the Zhao You group of the same mine surpassed the Ma Liu Hai group with a speed of 451 meters per month. The working class is constantly increasing production and creating new records in this way.
    The Mining and Metallurgy section also exhibits mining and metallurgical products such as sulfur, gypsum, asbestos, and refractory materials, which are closely related to the lives of the people of North China. After liberation, not only has the production volume of these products significantly increased, but the quality has also improved rapidly. The quality of many products has surpassed that of foreign goods. Sulfur is a famous product of Shanxi Province. Comparing the first half of 1951 with the first half of 1950, the output increased by 1.24 times; the quality increased from 93.96 percent to 99.87 percent, while the quality of foreign goods is only about 93 percent.
    Steel is the foundation for construction and national defense consolidation. The Mining and Metallurgy section prominently introduces the heroic and exemplary deeds of national labor models Wang Guiying and Pan Changyou in increasing steel production. It is precisely because of the active labor of these heroic models that steel production in North China has increased dramatically. Compared with before liberation, iron production has increased by 3.02 times, steel has increased by 2.95 times, and shaped steel has increased by 2.38 times. These figures are amazing.
    Of course, we must continue to work hard to exploit our underground treasures, and our smelting industry still needs to be developed urgently. There are still some problems in the utilization of many natural resources. For example, alkali is in short supply in Beijing, Tianjin, and various provinces; but there is an endless supply of natural alkali in the alkali lakes of Suiyuan. The quality of these alkalis is very good and can be used without processing, but there are difficulties in transportation. The production cost of each jin of natural alkali in the alkali lake is only 150 yuan, but the freight to Beijing and Tianjin is extremely high. This is a problem that we need to work hard to solve.
Electrical Industry is Developing
    "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country," this is the great instruction of Lenin, the revolutionary teacher of the world's people. Electricity has a very important meaning in the development of industry and agriculture, and in the forward development of the entire national economy. The Electrical Appliances section systematically introduces the current state of electricity in North China and its development after liberation. The development of the electrical industry in North China after liberation has been rapid. Although the production equipment has not increased, the power generation has gradually increased due to the acceptance of advanced Soviet experience and the high production enthusiasm of the employees. In 1950, the power generation in North China increased by 7 percent compared to 1948 before liberation, the electricity sales increased by 35 percent, and the industrial electricity consumption increased by 57 percent; while in the same period, coal consumption decreased by 24.3 percent, and line loss decreased from 31.8 percent to 15.4 percent.
    The vision of future electrification exhibited in the Electrical Appliances section, the model of hydropower generation, the model of using hydropower to drive water pumps to irrigate fields, and the pictures of rural electrification have all attracted great attention. In the pictures of rural electrification, everything is powered by electricity, using electricity for irrigation, and using electricity to drive tractors for plowing and harvesting; milking cows with electricity, shearing sheep with electricity, and even cleaning livestock manure with electricity. This is the beautiful vision of the countryside, and we are moving towards the beautiful vision.
The Great Creative Power of the Working Class
    The Machinery section exhibits many machines for processing agricultural products, including cotton pickers, crushers, oil presses, oil refiners, etc. Small free-style oil presses, millet machines, hand-cranked corn threshers, bean cake crushers, rice hullers, grass cutters, various sprayers, and universal crushers are all manufactured for the development of agricultural production. A medium-sized new-style oil press can press 25,000 to 30,000 jin of cottonseed per day, and can press 8,000 to 10,000 jin of soybeans, sesame, flax, and rapeseed. The quality of the oil produced is also higher than that produced by indigenous methods. An electric millet machine can grind 1,000 jin of millet per hour, while manual labor can only grind 30 jin per hour, a difference of more than 30 times.
    In the Machinery section, the most popular are small machines suitable for current conditions. For example, a small free-style oil press has very simple equipment. As long as there is a room, two people, and an electric motor, 200 jin of oil can be produced every day; while indigenous oil pressing requires equipment such as stir-fry pans, steamers, and stone mills. This equipment occupies eight rooms; eight people operate it, and only 50 jin of oil can be produced per day. A hand-cranked corn thresher that can be purchased for 150,000 yuan can thresh 400 to 450 jin of corn per day, which is very suitable for the current rural areas.
    The industrial and mining machinery part of the Machinery section exhibits lathes, gear hobbing machines, air compressors, blowers, water pumps, coal cutters, diesel-gas dual-purpose engines, etc. Before liberation, under the monopoly and constraints of imperialism, it was difficult for our country to produce these machines; after liberation, the working class exerted great creative power, overcame various difficulties, and manufactured various machine tools, laying the foundation for our future economic construction and smashing the enemy's "blockade" conspiracy. The precision of our self-made universal automatic lathe with all gears can reach 0.02 mm. Our self-made 65-horsepower coal cutter was produced by the workers of the Taiyuan Machine Factory in order to welcome this year's National Day, overcoming various difficulties under extremely incomplete equipment conditions. The product is all steel, has more horsepower than foreign goods, and can guarantee safety. These creations of the working class are the pride of the Chinese people.
    After visiting the Heavy Industry Pavilion, everyone will feel deeply the greatness of our motherland and the rapid development of our industry; thereby recognizing the great creative power of the working class and seeing the beautiful prospects of the motherland. Li Xiuying, a farmer representative from Pingyuan Province, wrote in the opinion book: "Now, in the country led by Chairman Mao, the workers have exerted great creativity and created many new utensils. I will definitely tell everyone when I go back to increase production, supply industrial raw materials to the city, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance."

    发展我们的重工业
    ——华北区城乡物资交流展览会重工业馆介绍
     李琏
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会重工业馆系统地有重点地介绍了华北区重工业的情况。在这里，人们看到两年多来在人民政府领导下，华北重工业迅速发展的情况，也看到了将来发展的无限前途与美好远景。煤、铁及钢的生产显著进步
    重工业馆分为矿冶室、电器室、机器室三部分。我们从矿冶室看到的是，解放了的工人阶级，以忘我的劳动创造了从所未有的奇迹。焦作煤矿一九五○年生产量比解放前增加了三十七点四倍。大同煤矿的马六孩小组，以每月掘进三百八十公尺创造了新纪录，但同矿的赵有小组，却又以每月掘进四百五十一公尺的速度超过了马六孩小组，工人阶级就这样不断地提高产量，创造新纪录。
    矿冶室还展出了硫黄、石膏、石棉、耐火器材等矿冶产品，这些矿产和华北人民的生活有着很密切的关系。在解放后，这些产品不仅生产量有了显著的增加，质量上也有迅速的改进，许多产品的质量已经超过外国货。硫黄是山西省的名产，以一九五一年前半年和一九五○年前半年比较，产量增加了一点二四倍；质量由百分之九十三点九六增为百分之九十九点八七，而外国货的质量，只有百分之九十三左右。
    钢铁是从事建设、巩固国防的基础。矿冶室突出地介绍了全国劳动模范王贵英、潘长有增产钢铁的英雄模范事迹。正是由于这些英雄模范积极劳动的结果，华北的钢铁产量急剧的增加，解放前后比较，铁的产量增加三点○二倍，钢增加了二点九五倍，型钢增加了二点三八倍，这些数字是惊人的。
    当然，我们还要继续努力来采掘我们地下的宝藏，我们的冶炼工业还是亟待发展的。在许多天然物资的利用上，还有一些问题。例如碱在北京、天津及各省都呈现着供不应求的现象；但在绥远的碱湖中却有无尽的天然碱，这些碱的品质很好，不用加工都可以用，但在运输上存在着困难。每斤天然碱在碱湖生产成本只需一百五十元，运到北京、天津，运费极高，这是需要我们努力解决的。电气工业在发展中
    “共产主义就是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化”，这是世界人民的革命导师列宁的伟大指示。在工业和农业的发展上，在整个国民经济向前发展的时候，电都有着很重要的意义。电器室系统地介绍了目前华北电力的情况和在解放后的发展情形。解放后华北电气工业的发展是迅速的，生产设备虽未增加，但因接受了苏联的先进经验，职工们又发挥了高度的生产热情，发电量逐步提高了。一九五○年，华北的发电量较解放前的一九四八年增加了百分之七，售电量增加了百分之三十五，工业用电增加了百分之五十七；而在同一时期，煤耗却减少了百分之二十四点三，线路损失由百分之三十一点八，减为百分之十五点四。
    电器室展出的未来电气化的远景，水力发电的模型，用水力发电发动水泵来灌溉田地的模型，农村电气化的图片，都引起人们高度的注意。在农村电气化的图片里，一切都用电力，用电力灌溉，用电力开动拖拉机耕种收割；挤牛乳用电力，剪羊毛用电力，甚至清除牲畜的粪便都用电力。这是农村的美丽远景，我们正在向美丽的远景前进。工人阶级伟大的创造力量
    机器?展出了许多为农业产品加工的机器，包括克皮机、粉碎机、榨油机、清油机，等等。小型的自由式榨油机、小米机、手摇玉米脱粒机、豆饼粉碎机、攞稻机、切草机、各种喷雾器、万能粉碎机等，都是为着发展农业生产而制造的。一台中型新式榨油机每天能榨棉籽二万五千斤至三万斤，能榨大豆、芝麻、胡麻、菜籽等八千斤至一万斤，出油质量也比土法产油为高。一台电动小米机每小时能碾小米一千斤，人力每小时只能碾三○斤，相差三十多倍。
    在机器室里，最受欢迎的是适合目前条件的小型机器。如小型自由式榨油机，设备很简单，只要一间房、两个人、一台电动机，每天就可以产油二百斤；而土法榨油，则需要炒锅、蒸锅、石磨等设备，这些设备，要占八间房子；八个人操作，每日只能产油五十斤。一架十五万元即可购买的手摇玉米脱粒机，每天可以脱粒四百至四百五十市斤玉米，很适用于目前农村。
    机器室的工矿机器部分展出了车床、滚齿机、空气压缩机、鼓风机、水泵、截煤机、柴油瓦斯两用引擎等。解放前，在帝国主义垄断束缚下，我国很难生产这些机器；解放后，工人阶级发挥了伟大的创造力量，克服了各种困难，制造了各种母机，为我们今后的经济建设打下了基础，粉碎了敌人“封锁”的阴谋。我们自制的全齿万能自动车床，其精确程度可达零点零二公厘。我们自制的六十五马力截煤机，是太原机器厂的工人，为了迎接今年国庆节，在设备极不完全的条件下，克服了各种困难生产出来的，产品全部钢制，马力比外国货大，而且可以保证安全，工人阶级的这些创造，是中国人民的骄傲。
    参观了重工业馆，每个人都会亲切地感到我们祖国的伟大，我们工业发展的迅速；从而认识了工人阶级伟大的创造力量，看到了祖国的美丽远景。平原省农民代表李秀英在意见簿上写着：“现在毛主席领导的国家，工人发挥很大的创造力，造出许多新的用具，回去一定告诉大家，增加生产，供应城市工业原料，加强工农联盟。”
