Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 5)
    Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi

    Third Section    Logic

    Grammar and Logic. In the first paragraph of the first lecture, it was stated that "Grammar is not logic." This sentence has two meanings. First, as we explained in that paragraph, even if the structure of a sentence is correct, if it doesn't make sense logically, the sentence is still incorrect. The example given there was "Learning has the division of attitude and method." This sentence is formally the same as "Living things have the division of animals and plants," but "animals" and "plants" add up to "living things," while "attitude" and "method" do not add up to "learning." Therefore, this sentence is incorrect.

    The second meaning of "Grammar is not logic" is: Some sentences, although a strict logical analysis may find them questionable, are said by everyone, and everyone understands their meaning, with no gap or misunderstanding between the speaker and the listener. From a grammatical standpoint, we cannot but admit that they are correct. For example, "好不热闹" (hǎo bù rènào), literally "not good, not lively," should mean "very not lively," but in reality, it equals "好热闹" (hǎo rènào), "very lively." Conversely, "好容易" (hǎo róngyì), literally "good easy," does not equal "很容易" (hěn róngyì), "very easy," but instead equals "很不容易" (hěn bù róngyì), "very not easy," "very difficult." Another example is "除非你去请他，他才肯来" (chúfēi nǐ qù qǐng tā, tā cái kěn lái), "Unless you invite him, only then will he be willing to come." Since your inviting him is taken as the condition for him to come, "除非你去请他" (chúfēi nǐ qù qǐng tā), "unless you invite him," indicates that this condition does not exist, then the following should only be "他不来" (tā bù lái), "he won't come," but everyone says "他才肯来" (tā cái kěn lái), "only then will he be willing to come." Another example is "他的北京话比我好" (tā de Běijīng huà bǐ wǒ hǎo), "His Beijing dialect is better than me." How can language be compared with a person? It should be "他的北京话比我的好" (tā de Běijīng huà bǐ wǒ de hǎo), "His Beijing dialect is better than mine," to be logical, but few people are willing to add this "的" (de) character.

    Looking at these two meanings together, they seem to be conflicting. The same examples of divergence between grammar and logic, but some sentences we say are incorrect, and some sentences we admit are correct. In reality, these two meanings are not conflicting. The first type of example represents the general situation: Generally speaking, grammar must conform to logic; a sentence must not only have an appropriate structure but also make sense logically to be considered correct. The second type of example represents idioms: Idioms do not allow analysis and do not allow extrapolation. Language is a tool, and we use this tool to achieve our goals. If a sentence can elicit the reaction expected by the speaker, it can be said to have completed its task. The second type of example can satisfy this condition and should therefore be considered correct. The first type of example is not so. If what you say does not follow general patterns of thought, people cannot understand it immediately, and you cannot achieve the purpose of saying the sentence. Therefore, after saying "Grammar is not logic," we then said, "In reality, it cannot be separated from logic."

    Below are some examples of logical problems.

    Scope. Due to not clearly distinguishing the scope of concepts, people often say self-contradictory things. For example:

    (1) Although the main force of bandits in western Yunnan has been largely defeated, bandits throughout Yunnan Province are still rampant. (Periodical)
    (2) We believe that you have a high degree of patriotism, revolutionary heroism, and creative spirit, with the broad masses taking you as the backbone, uniting around you, and will create more new records in this winter's repairs. (Draft)
    (3) The Minister of Culture and Education is in charge of this school and took away all the personnel of the department, and several people were transferred from other departments. (Draft)

    (1) Western Yunnan is a part of Yunnan. Since it says the main force of bandits in western Yunnan has been "largely defeated," it cannot say "bandits throughout Yunnan Province are still rampant." "Yunnan Province" should be changed to "other areas within the province."
    (2) Since it says "taking you as the backbone," it naturally includes "you," and then saying "uniting around you," means uniting oneself around oneself, which is absurd.
    (3) "Among them" naturally refers to the personnel of the Ministry of Culture and Education. How can there be "several people" from "other departments" among the personnel of the Ministry of Culture and Education? "Among them" should be deleted.

    Part and Whole Cannot Be Listed Together. We can say "pears and apples," and we can also say "pears and peaches," but we cannot say "pears and fruits," because fruit includes pears. The following examples are wrong:

    (4) In the past year, members and youths of the hospital have voluntarily donated 10,440 CC of blood. (Periodical)
    (5) What is gratifying is that the people of Asia and the people of the world have risen up. (Periodical)
    (6) In recovery and construction, there is a lack of various scientific experts and various talents. (Periodical)
    (7) Many settlers from Shanghai brought their mothers and families to the reclamation area to live together. (Newspaper)

    Members are a part of youth, Asian people are a part of the people of the whole world, "various scientists" are included within "various talents," mothers are included within family members, and cannot be listed together. The statements in (4) and (5) are now very popular, but they are illogical. (4) is better to say "members and non-member youths." (5) should say "Asia and the rest of the world's people." (6) should say "various experts and other talents." (7) should delete "mothers."

    When more than two items are listed, the situation is the same. In short, the listed items must be independent and parallel; no item can contain another item.

    (8) Some came from the liberated areas, some came from the countryside, some came from the army, and some came from Yan'an. (Periodical)

    The liberated areas include Yan'an and also include the "countryside." "The army" refers to the People's Liberation Army. The places reached by the People's Liberation Army are naturally liberated areas. If they were not originally, they become liberated areas after reaching them. The last three items are all contained within the first item and cannot be listed together. The method of changing it is to delete the first clause, or to merge the first two clauses into "Some came from the rural areas of the liberated areas."

    Conversely, when classifying, the subcategories must be able to be included in the main category. Because the main category and the subcategories are not parallel relationships but inclusive relationships. For example:

    (9) In the past year, the May 1st Factory has written a total of 39 scripts that target the actual situation (including scripts, drum lyrics, and rhythmic clappers). (Book)
    (10) Swimming tickets are divided into ordinary tickets, visitor tickets, monthly passes, quarterly passes, and other types. (Newspaper)

    (9) Scripts cannot include drum lyrics, nor can they include rhythmic clappers. Scripts including scripts also have no meaning. "Scripts" should be changed to "works."
    (10) Swimming tickets cannot include visitor tickets. It should say: "Swimming tickets are divided into ordinary tickets, monthly passes, quarterly passes, etc., and there are also visitor tickets."

    Cause and Effect. Although judging that two things have a causal relationship is a subjective opinion, it must have an objective fact as a foundation. Words such as "because," "therefore," "due to," and "as a result" can only express causal relationships and absolutely cannot make things without a causal relationship develop a causal relationship.

    (11) Because learning attitudes vary with each person's learning goals, my learning attitude has also changed greatly with liberation. (Composition)

    The first and second sentences are correct when viewed separately, but it is wrong to connect them with "because" and "therefore." There is no causal relationship between the two.

    (12) Because he comes from middle school, his thinking is still fundamentally the set of the old society. (Composition)
    (13) Recently, this friend of mine returned from the south, and as a result, his thinking remained the same. (Composition)

    These two sentences are even more perplexing. Why is it that thinking is old because one "comes from middle school?" Why should thinking change as a result of "returning from the south?"

    (14) Due to my emphasis on certain subjects, I am not interested in mathematics and physics. (Composition)
    (15) Many cadres only focused on the work in heavily disaster-stricken areas, thus neglecting lightly disaster-stricken areas; they only focused on rural disaster relief, thus neglecting cities; they only focused on local disaster victims, thus neglecting the care for disaster victims from other places. (Book)

    (14) "Not being interested in mathematics and physics" is a specific manifestation of "emphasizing certain subjects;" (15) Since one "focuses on heavily disaster-stricken areas," one naturally "neglects lightly disaster-stricken areas;" otherwise, there would be no "focus." The preceding and following sentences in these two examples are either two different ways of saying the same thing (14) or two sides of the same thing (15). There is no causal relationship between them.

    Self-Contradiction.

    (16) He was one of the survivors among many who died. (Draft)
    (17) Both current and past historical facts have shown that the U.S. imperialists' adventurous interference in the internal affairs of Korea today is bound to fail. (Periodical)
    (18) In propaganda work, I personally witnessed the suffering of the working people in the past. (Newspaper)
    (19) Regarding the big question of Ah Q, a majority agreed with a completely affirmative reservation. (Newspaper)
    (20) Although these common points are common among them, they show great differences between them and the Mongolian and Han nationalities. (Newspaper)
    (21) This is one of the true faces of U.S. imperialism. (Periodical)

    (16) Since he "survived," he naturally did not die. How can he be said to be "one of those who died?" It should be changed to "Many people died, and he was one of the survivors."
    (17) All historical facts are in the past. Current events cannot be called "historical facts." "Historical facts" should be changed to "facts."
    (18) Since it is "suffering in the past," it is impossible to "personally witness" it now. "Personally witnessed" should be changed to "experienced."
    (19) If it is completely affirmative, there can be no reservations. If there are reservations, it is not completely affirmative.
    (20) "These common points... show great differences" does not make sense. It should be changed to "These common points distinguish them from the Mongolian and Han nationalities."
    (21) The "true face" can only be one. Now saying "one of," it seems like there are also "two of" and "three of." "One of" should be deleted.

    Some words are used too frequently and have become clichés. We easily overlook their original meanings and use them with words of opposite meaning, thus creating contradictions. For example:

    (22) Now, because all aspects are taken care of thoroughly, there are almost fundamentally no prisoners who have died. (Newspaper)
    (23) Basically, bad habits have been completely overcome. (Draft)
    (24) At that time, Liu Yong's health was inherently not good. (Periodical)
    (25) Worried that the Korean people will inevitably encounter a tragic fate. (Periodical)

    (22) "Almost" and "fundamentally" contradict each other. One must be deleted.
    (23) "Basically" and "completely" contradict each other. Only one can be used (regarding "basically," see the fifth paragraph of the second lecture).
    (24) "At that time" and "inherently" contradict each other. "At that time" should be deleted.
    (25) "Worried" and "will inevitably" contradict each other. The word "will" should be deleted.

    These four examples are only contradictory on the surface. The following two examples are different:

    (26) The sales of production goods have increased, and even the vast majority are in short supply, but still not smooth. (Draft)
    (27) The story of this script is likely to happen, so it fully reflects the society at that time, it is realistic, and has great progressive significance, but it is relatively too ideal... (Composition)

    (26) "Sales have increased" and "the vast majority are in short supply," but it is said that "still not smooth." Then, what is considered "smooth?"
    (27) First, it says "This story is likely to happen," and then says "reflects the society at that time," and also concludes that "it is realistic," suddenly turns a one hundred and eighty degree corner and says "but it is relatively too ideal," overturning all the previous words. Isn't that slapping one's own face?

    Time Sequence.

    (28) They are desperately climbing upward, and at the same time, they inevitably fall into the abyss. (Composition)
    (29) British and French imperialists burned and looted the famous gardens in the western suburbs of Beijing. (Periodical)
    (30) More than a year ago, Nanjing, which was once called "huge," "bloated," "consumerist," and "reactionary," once it became the property of the people, today it appears so youthful. (Periodical)
    (31) The sisters in the rural areas of various places must continue the spirit of men and women completing land reform together in the land reform and actively participate in land reform. (Periodical)

    "One side... the other side..." indicates that two things are happening at the same time, such as "Negotiating on one side and attacking on the other side." The two things in (28) are obviously not simultaneous and cannot use this sentence structure. It should be changed to "Although he desperately climbed upward, he inevitably fell into the abyss."
    (29) After burning, what is left to loot? "Burning" and "looting" should be reversed.
    (30) "Once" refers to the day of "becoming the property of the people," which is not the same as "today." "Youthful" is also inappropriate. It should be changed to "... today, in the hands of the people, it appears so young and vibrant."
    (31) The author uses the word "continue," as if the land reform has ended, and then says "participate in land reform," which is self-contradictory. "Continue in the land reform" should be changed to "developing."

    Double Negative. When two negative words are used in a sentence, it contains an affirmative meaning, just as negative multiplied by negative is positive in algebra. For example, "未尝不可" (wèi cháng bùkě), "never not possible," means "possible," "无孔不入" (wú kǒng bù rù), "no hole not enter," means "enter every hole," "不无可议之处" (bù wú kěyì zhī chù), "not without questionable points," is equal to saying "颇有可议之处" (pō yǒu kěyì zhī chù), "quite have questionable points," "没有一个人不相信" (méiyǒu yī gè rén bù xiāngxìn), "no one does not believe," equals saying "大家都相信" (dàjiā dōu xiāngxìn), "everyone believes."

    (32) We do not completely deny that this poem does not reveal hope, but rather say that this hope is very slim. (Composition)
    (33) In addition to the issued admission ticket, family members of members must also have a family member badge; without either, they cannot enter. (Document)

    (32) "Not completely deny" is equal to "partially acknowledge," which is basically acknowledging. Therefore, this sentence is equal to saying "We acknowledge that this poem does not reveal hope," which is exactly the opposite of the author's original intention. There are three ways to change it:
        "We acknowledge that this poem also reveals some hope..."
        "We do not deny that this poem also reveals some hope..."
        "We are not saying that this poem does not reveal hope..."

    (33) "Without either, they cannot enter" equals saying "With either, they can enter" (of course, according to strict logic, these two sentences are not exactly the same, because from "without, it will definitely not happen" cannot be inferred "with, it will definitely happen," but here, we are only talking about general understanding). This does not match the original intention. It should say "Lacking either, they cannot enter."

    (34) I think it should not be necessary to describe, there is no one who cannot imagine it. (Periodical)

    This sentence uses three negative words in a row. Negative multiplied by negative is positive, positive multiplied by negative is still negative. Therefore, "there is no one who cannot imagine it" is equal to saying "no one can imagine it," but the original intention is "everyone can imagine it."

    Subject and Object Reversed.

    (35) At that time, the opportunity for the newspaper to contact me was very few. (Composition)
    (36) The learning mood of last year is very different compared to this year. (Composition)
    (37) As far as I know, there are many people in various theater troupes who suffer from tuberculosis due to insecurity in life and malnutrition, such as Zhao Ming of Team 9, Jiang Chao and Zhang Ke of Team 4, etc., all have lung disease, but they do not even get the opportunity to rest. Compared to Cai Chusheng, he is much more fortunate. (Newspaper)

    (35) It should be I contact the newspaper, not the newspaper contact me. "Newspaper" and "I" should be reversed.
    (36) The author means to say "The learning mood of this year is better than last year," but he reversed the positions of "this year" and "last year," so the meaning is exactly the opposite.
    (37) "He" refers to Cai Chusheng. If pronouns are not used, this sentence would become "Compared to Cai Chusheng, Cai Chusheng is much more fortunate," which is absurd. It should say "Compared to them, Cai Chusheng is much more fortunate," or "Compared to them, Cai Chusheng can be considered much more fortunate."

    One-sidedness and Two-sidedness. Some words have only one-sided meanings. This so-called one-sidedness can be positive, such as "good," "high," "go," "suitable;" or it can be negative, such as "bad," "low," "not go," "not suitable." Some words have both positive and negative meanings, such as "good or bad," "high or low," "go or not go," "whether suitable or not." When constructing sentences, if one-sided words are matched with two-sided words, it will cause confusion, for example:

    (38) Ignoring the difficulty of whether the cooperative is at a loss or making a profit. (Draft)
    (39) Therefore, the basic principle of departmental adjustment is whether teaching can be more smoothly transformed as a result. (Periodical)
    (40) Young men and women no longer use the amount of property and social status as conditions, but use the ability to work, love of learning, and ideological progress as criteria to choose their partners. (Newspaper)
    (41) Doing a good job in production and disaster relief depends on whether the cadres' work style is in-depth. (Book)

    (38) "Difficulty" is one-sided, and "whether at a loss or making a profit" is two-sided. The two do not match. Being at a loss is a difficulty; not being at a loss is not a difficulty. "Whether" should be deleted.
    (39) "Principle" is one-sided, and "whether..." is two-sided. It should say "...the principle is to make teaching able to be smoothly transformed."
    (40) "Conditions" is one-sided, and "amount of property" and "social status" are two-sided. This sentence can be changed to "When young men and women choose their partners, they no longer care about the other party's amount of property and social status, but use...as conditions."
    (41) "Doing a good job" is one-sided, and "whether in-depth" is two-sided. In addition, "whether the work style is in-depth" also does not make sense. It is probably the meaning of "whether the cadres go deep into the masses." This sentence has two ways to change it: either change the first clause to two-sided: "Whether the production and disaster relief work is done well depends on whether the cadres go deep into the masses." Or change the second clause to one-sided, but the structure of the sentence also needs to be adjusted: "Cadres going deep into the masses is the decisive condition for doing a good job in production and disaster relief."

    语法、修辞讲话（第五讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第三段    逻辑
    语法和逻辑。第一讲第一段里曾经说过，“语法不是逻辑。”这句话有两层意思。第一，就是我们在那一段里说明的，尽管一个句子的结构是正确的，要是事理上讲不过去，这句话还是不通。那儿举的例子是“学习有态度与方法”之分。这句话在形式上跟“生物有动物与植物之分”是一样的，但是“动物”和“植物”加起来等于“生物”，而“态度”和“方法”加起来不等于“学习”。所以这句话是不通的。
    “语法不是逻辑”的第二层意思是：有些话虽然用严格的逻辑眼光来分析有点说不过去，但是大家都这样说，都懂得它的意思，听的人和说的人中间毫无隔阂，毫无误会。站在语法的立场。就不能不承认它是正确的。例如“好不热闹”，按说该是“很不热闹”的意思，但是实际上等于“好热闹”；跟这相反的是“好容易”，它不等于“很容易”，反而等于“很不容易”。又如“除非你去请他，他才肯来”，既然把你请他当作他来的条件，“除非你去请他”表示这个条件不存在，那末底下只能说“他不来”，可是大家都说“他才肯来”。又如“他的北京话比我好”，话怎么能跟人比较呢？应该说“他的北京话比我的好”，才合于逻辑，可是很少人愿意加上这个“的”字。
    这两层意思放在一起看，似乎是冲突的。同样是语法和逻辑分歧的例子，可是有些句子我们说是不通，有些句子我们又承认是正确。实际上这两层意思并不冲突。第一类例子代表一般的情形：一般地说，语法要服从逻辑，一句话不但要有适当的结构，也要事理上讲得过去，才算是通。第二类例子代表习惯语：习惯语是不容许分析的，并且是不容许援例的。语言是一种工具，我们使用这种工具去达到我们的目的。一句话，如果能引起说话的人所期望的反应，就可以说是完成了它的任务。第二类的例子能满足这个条件，因而就应该算是正确的。第一类的例子就不然了。你说的话不依照一般的思想规律，人家不能一听就懂，你也就不能达到你说这句话的目的了。所以我们在说过“语法不是逻辑”之后，接着又说，“实际上离不开逻辑。”
    下面是一些逻辑上有问题的例子。
    范围大小。由于没有把概念的范围分辨清楚，往往说出自相矛盾的话来。例如：
    （一）滇西大股土匪虽已大部被击溃，但云南全
        省土匪仍然猖獗。（期）
    （二）我们相信你们有高度的爱国主义、革命英
        雄主义和创造精神，有以你们为骨干的广大
        群众团结在你们的周围，今年冬修中会创造
        出更多的新记录。（稿）
    （三）由文教部长主持这学校，带走了该部全部
        人员，其中还从其他部门抽调了几人。
        （稿）（一）滇西是云南的一部分。既然说滇西土匪已“大部被击溃”，就不能说“云南全省土匪仍然猖獗”。“云南全省”应该改做“省内其他地区”。
    （二）既说“以你们为骨干”，当然包括“你们”在内，又说“团结在你们的周围”，自己团结在自己的周围，岂非怪事？（三）“其中”自然是指文教部人员之中，文教部人员之中怎么能有“其它部门”的“几人”呢？“其中”应删。
    部分和全体不能并列。我们可以说“梨和苹果”，也可以说“梨和桃子”，却不能说“梨和水果”，因为水果包括梨在内。下面的例子是错的：
    （四）一年来，医院的团员与青年自愿输血达一
        万零四百四十个CC。（期）
    （五）可喜的是亚洲的人民和世界的人民都起来
        了。（期）
    （六）在恢复与建设上，缺乏各项科学专家与各
        项人才。（期）
    （七）许多垦民从上海把自己的母亲，家属接到
        垦区来共同生活。（报）团员是青年的一部分，亚洲人民是全世界人民的一部分，“各项科学家”包括在“各项人才”之内，母亲包括在家属之内，都不能并列。（四）和（五）的说法现在很流行，但这是不合逻辑的。（四）不如说“团员和非团员青年”。（五）该说“亚洲与全世界其它各地人民”。（六）该说“各科专家与其他人才”。（七）应删“母亲”。
    所举不止两项的时候，情形也一样。总之，列举各项必须是独立而平行的，任何一项不能包含另一项。
    （八）有的是从解放区来的，有的是从农村来的，
        有的是从部队里来的，还有从延安来的。（
        期）解放区包含延安，也包含“农村”。“部队”指人民解放军。人民解放军到达的地方，自然是解放区，如果原先不是，到达之后也就成了解放区。后三项都包含在第一项之内，不能并举。改的方法是把第一个分句删去，或是把前两个分句合并成“有的是从解放区农村来的”。
    跟这相反，在分类的时候，分出的小类必须是能够包括在大类之中的。因为大类跟小类不是平行的关系，而是包含的关系。例如：
    （九）一年来五一工厂共写出了三十九个针对实
        际情况的剧本（包括剧本、鼓词、快板）。
        （书）
    （十）游泳券分普通券，参观券、月票、季票等
        种。（报）
    （九）剧本不能包括鼓词，也不能包括快板，剧本包括剧本也没有意义。“剧本”应改为“作品”。（十）游泳券不能包括参观券。应该说：“游泳券分普通券、月票、季票等，另有参观券。”
    因果关系。判断两件事有因果关系虽然是主观的见解，但是必须有客观事实做基础。“因为”“所以”“由于”“结果”等词只能表示因果关系，绝对不能使没有因果关系的事情发生因果关系。
    （十一）因为学习态度是随着各人的学习目的而
        不同，所以我的学习态度也随着解放而大大
        地改变了。（作）前后两句话分开看都不错，可是用“因为”“所以”连在一处就不对了。二者没有因果关系。
    （十二）因为他来自中学，思想根本还是旧社会
        的一套。（作）
    （十三）最近我这位朋友从南方回来，结果他的
        思想依然如故。（作）这两句话更令人大惑不解。为甚么“来自中学”，思想就旧？为甚么从南方回来，思想就要变？
    （十四）由于我对于学科有偏重，因而对于数理
        就不感兴趣。（作）
    （十五）许多干部只着重了重灾区的工作，因而
        忽视了轻灾区，只着重了农村救灾，因而忽
        视了城市，只着重了本地灾民，因而忽视了
        对外来灾民的照顾。（书）
    （十四）    “对于数理不感兴趣”是“对于学科有偏重”的具体表现；（十五）既然“着重重灾区”，自然就“忽视轻灾区”，否则就无所谓“着重”。这两个例子的前后两句或是一件事的两种不同的说法（十四），或是一件事的两面（十五），其间都没有因果关系。
    自相矛盾。
    （十六）他是多少个死难者中幸免的一个。（稿）
    （十七）眼前的和过去的史实都说明了今天美帝
        的冒险干涉朝鲜内政是必然要失败的。（期）
    （十八）在宣传工作中，我亲眼看到劳动人民过
        去所受的痛苦。（报）
    （十九）大的关于阿Q的问题，附带了保留完全
        肯定的同意者占多数。（报）
    （二十）这些共同点，在他们中间虽是共同的，
        但在他们与蒙汉民族间，却表现出很大的不
        同来。（报）
    （二一）这就是美帝国主义的本来面目之一。
        （期）
    （十六）既然“幸免”，自然是没有死，怎么能说是“死难者中的一个”呢？应改做“多少人死难了，他是幸免的一个”。（十七）凡是史实，都是过去的，眼前的事不能叫“史实”。应把“史实”改做“事实”。（十八）既然是“过去所受的痛苦”，现在就无法“亲眼看到”，“亲眼看到”应改为“体会到”。（十九）如果是完全肯定，就不能有所保留；有所保留，就不是完全肯定。（二十）“这些共同点……表现出很大的不同来”是讲不通的，应改做“这些共同点使他们和蒙汉民族有区别”。（二一）“本来面目”只能有一，不能有二。现在说“之一”，好像还有“之二”“之三”似的。“之一”应删。
    有些词语用得太频繁，变成了口头禅，我们很容易忽视它们的本义，拿来跟意义相反的词语连用，因而产生了矛盾。例如：
    （二二）现在因为各方面照顾得周到，差不多根
        本就没有死去的犯人。（报）
    （二三）基本上把不好的习惯克服干净了。（稿）
    （二四）当时刘涌的身体本是不好的。（期）
    （二五）担心朝鲜人民必将遭遇悲惨的命运。
        （期）
    （二二）“差不多”和“根本”矛盾，必须删去一个。（二三）“基本上”和“干净”矛盾，也只能用一个（关於“基本上”，参看第二讲第五段）。
    （二四）“当时”和“本是”矛盾，“当时”应删。（二五）“担心”和“必将”矛盾，“必”字应删。这四个例子只是字面上矛盾，下面两个例子就不同了：
    （二六）生产品的销路是增加了，甚至绝大部分
        供不应求，但仍不畅。（稿）
    （二七）这个剧本的故事是可能发生的，所以它
        充分地反映了当时的社会，它是写实的，有很
        大的进步意义的，只是比较太理想……（作）（二六）“销路增加了”，而且“绝大部分供不应求”，还说“不畅”，那么怎样才算是“畅”呢？（二七）先说“这个故事是可能发生的”，又说“反映了当时的社会”，而且自己下结论说“它是写实的”，忽然转了一个一百八十度的弯，说“只是比较太理想”，把前面的话全部推翻，岂不是自己打自己的嘴巴？时间先后。（二八）他们一面拚命地向上爬，一面又不免跌
    落深渊。（作）（二九）英法帝国主义者烧毁并洗劫了北京西郊
    的名园。（期）（三十）一年多以前曾被人们称为“庞大”“拥
    肿”“消费”“反动”的南京，当它一旦成
    为人民所有，今天已经是显得如此青春。（期）（三一）各地农村姊妹们要继土改中男女一齐完
    成土改的精神，积极参加土地改革。（期）
    “一面……一面……”表示两件事同时进行，如
    “一面谈判，一面进攻。”（二八）的两件事显然不是同时的，不能用这种句式。应该改做“他虽然拚命向上爬，但是终不免跌落深渊。”（二九）烧毁之后哪里还有东西可抢劫？“烧毁”和“洗劫”应对调。（三十）的“一旦”指“为人民所有”的那
    一天，跟“今天”不是同时。“青春”也不恰当，应该改做“……今天在人民的手里，却显得这样年青、活泼。”（三一）作者用了一个“继”字，好像土改已结束了，下面又说“参加土地改革”，自相矛盾。“继土改中”应改为“发挥”。
    双重否定。一句话里用两个否定词，就含有肯定的意思，正如代数里负乘负得正一样。譬如“未尝不可”的意思是“可”，“无孔不入”的意思是 “有孔皆入”，“不无可议之处”等于说“颇有可议之处”，“没有一个人不相信”等于说“大家都相信”。
    （三二）我们并不是完全否认这首诗没有透露出
        希望，而是说这希望是非常渺茫的。（作）
    （三三）会员眷属除凭发出之入场券外，并须有
        眷属徽章，无二者之一即不能入场。（件）（三二）“不完全否认”等于“部分承认”，基本上还是承认。因此这句话等于说“我们承认这首诗没有透露出希望”，刚好跟作者的原意相反。改法有三种：“我们承认这首诗也透露了一些希望……”
    “我们并不否认这首诗也透露了一些希望……”
    “我们并不是说这首诗没有透露出希望……）。
    （三三）“无二者之一即不能入场”等于说“有二者之一即可入场”（当然，按照严格的逻辑说，这两句话并不完全相同，因为从“无之必不然”不能推论出“有之必然”，但这里只就一般人的了解说），跟原意不符，该说“缺二者之一即不能入场”。
    （三四）我想应该是不必叙述，没有谁不会想像
        不出的。（期）这句一连用了三个否定词，负乘负得正，正乘负仍得负。因此，“没有谁不会想像不出”等于说“谁都想像不出”，原意却是“谁也想像得出”。
    主客倒置。（三五）在那个时候，报纸与我接触的机会是很
    少的。（作）（三六）去年的学习情绪和今年比较起来大不相
    同。（作）（三七）据我所知道的，各剧团中因为生活不安
    营养不良而患肺结核的人非常多，如九队的
    赵明，四队的蒋超、张客等，都有肺病，但
    他们连休养的机会都得不到，比起蔡楚生
    来，他还算幸福多多了。（报）
    （三五）应该是我接触报纸，不是报纸接触我。“报纸”与“我”应对调。（三六）作者的意思是说
    “今年的学习情绪比去年好”，但是他把“今年”和“去年”的位置放倒了，于是意思刚好相反。（三七）“他”指的是蔡楚生，如果不用代词，这句话就成了“比起蔡楚生来，蔡楚生还算幸福得多，”岂不荒谬？应该说“蔡楚生比起他们来，还算幸福得多，”或是“比起他们来，蔡楚生还算幸福得多。”
    一面与两面。有些词语仅有一面的意思，所谓一面，可以是正面的，如“好”“高”“去”“相宜”；也可以是反面的，如“坏”“低”“不去”“不相宜”。有些词语兼有正反两面的意思，如
    “好坏”“高低”“去不去”“是否相宜”。造句的时候，如果把一面性的词语跟两面性的词语配搭，就会造成混乱，例如：（三八）忽视合作社是否亏损的困难。（稿）（三九）所以院系调整的基本原则是教学能否因
    此而更顺利的改造。（期）（四十）青年男女不再以财产多寡和门第高低为条件，而以能劳动、爱学习和思想进步为标准去选择自己的伴侣。（报）
    （四一）作好生产救灾工作，决定于干部作风是否深入。（书）
    （三八）“困难”是一面性的，“是否亏损”是两面性的，二者配搭不拢。亏损是困难，不亏损就不是困难。“是否”应删。（三九）“原则”是一面性的，“能否……”是两面性的。该说“……原则是使教学能够顺利的改造”。（四十）“条件”是一面性的，“财产多寡”“门第高低”是两面性的。这句话可以改做“青年男女选择自己的伴侣时，不再计较对方财产多寡，门第高低，而以……为条件。”（四一）“作好”是一面性的，“是否深入”是两面性的。此外，“作风是否深入”也讲不通，恐怕是“干部是否深入群众”的意思。这句话有两种改法，或是把第一个分句改成两面性的：“生产救灾工作做得好不好，决定于干部是不是深入群众。”或是把第二个分句改成一面性的，不过句子的结构也得调整一下：“干部深入群众是做好生产救灾工作的决定条件。”
