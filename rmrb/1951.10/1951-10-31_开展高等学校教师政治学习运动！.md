Launch a Political Study Movement for University Teachers!

Teachers of Normal University Determined to Remold Their Thinking

The teachers and students of Beijing Normal University are very excited about the study movement launched by university teachers in Beijing and Tianjin to remold their thinking. The students unanimously believe that it will provide an effective guarantee for the improvement and enhancement of the teaching work of the Normal University. Student Qian Manjun said, "I will respect teachers in the future and actively provide opinions to teachers to help them progress."

Professors also happily pledged to study hard and remold their thinking and work style. They have already organized a study committee. They wrote on big-character posters: "After listening to Premier Zhou's report, everyone deeply felt that there are many problems in their thinking, which will hinder personal progress and affect the teaching and progress of the Normal University; therefore, we decided to carry out self-remolding resolutely under the leadership of the higher authorities in the spirit of serving the people and being responsible to the revolution." Wang Zhaoheng, a professor in the Geography Department, said: "Our progress in the two years since liberation has not kept up with the needs of national cultural and educational construction. Under the leadership of the People's Government, I guarantee to study well and thoroughly clarify my thinking."

University Teachers Remolding Thinking
Meets the Requirements of Students

To the Editor:

The launch of a study movement by university teachers in Beijing and Tianjin to remold their thinking not only meets the requirements of the teachers, but also meets the requirements of all our students.

We often feel that some teachers' lectures are not satisfactory. In terms of teaching content, they are either impractical or have problems in their viewpoints. Students often raise many opinions, which make teachers feel embarrassed. Some teachers dare not criticize the old and dare not talk about the new, but only talk about things that are not important. This not only affects the students' learning, but also affects the teachers' teaching emotions. Of course, since liberation, especially in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, our teachers have made some progress. However, their progress is very insufficient and far behind the objective requirements. I hope that university teachers will intensify their study, remold their thinking, and become people's teachers.

Students of Peking University Welcome Teachers to Study

To the Editor:

We, the students of Peking University, express our warm welcome to the launch of a study movement by university teachers to remold their thinking. We believe that the launch of this movement is of great significance for the transformation of higher education. To this end, the Peking University Communications Group invited 15 student representatives from various departments to hold a forum at noon on the 23rd.

At the forum, student representatives expressed their opinions enthusiastically, believing that: After liberation, teachers established trade union organizations and carried out political study, and achieved some results, but their progress is far behind the objective requirements. They still have many shortcomings in their teaching ideology. Some teachers who have studied in Europe and the United States in the past retain the ideological remnants of the British and American bourgeoisie. If teachers do not overcome the ideological remnants of the European and American reactionary bourgeoisie, individualism, vulgar liberalism, and the erroneous idea of "capitalism as the base and Marxism-Leninism as the trimming," they will not be able to do their teaching work well, whether it is natural science or social science.

The student representatives who attended the meeting all hoped that teachers could adopt a humble attitude and launch criticism and self-criticism in this study. In the past, some teachers were not humble enough. For example, a professor in the Department of Western Languages ​​said to another professor who gave him advice: "Everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, I don't care about you, and you don't need to care about me." In this study, some professors have begun to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, Professor Wang Jiayin of the Geology Department criticized some of his past erroneous ideas, and Professor Pan Zhongxiang also criticized the erroneous view that "politics is dirty."

This study started from Peking University. We ask the teachers of Peking University to take the lead in this ideological transformation, earnestly and seriously launch criticism and self-criticism, so as to achieve the goal of transforming ideology and reforming higher education.

We Must Care About and Help Teachers
Carry Out Study

To the Editor:

I felt extremely excited after seeing the news that university teachers in Beijing and Tianjin launched a study movement to remold their thinking.

In the three major movements of Resist America, Aid Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, teachers have made some progress. However, many teachers have received bourgeois education in Europe and the United States. Therefore, they have many shortcomings in teaching, such as: First, cramming-style teaching methods, only focusing on instilling knowledge without considering whether students can digest it; second, transplanting the European and American model without combining it with the domestic situation; third, theory is not connected with practice, talking boastfully in the classroom but not solving problems. This also fails to meet the requirements of the majority of students.

Today, the people need us to become useful talents for building the motherland, and those who are directly responsible for cultivating us and have the greatest impact on us are our teachers. Therefore, their study and ideological remolding are of great importance to the students. As Chairman Mao said at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Ideological remolding, first of all, the ideological remolding of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization." Only when teachers study seriously and thoroughly remold their thinking can they teach students well and live up to the people's earnest expectations. Students should care about and help teachers carry out study.

    开展高等学校教师政治学习运动！
    师范大学教师决心改造思想
    北京师范大学师生对于北京、天津两市高等学校教师开展学习运动改造思想都非常兴奋。同学们一致认为，它将为师范大学教学工作的改进和提高，带来有效的保证。钱曼君同学说：“我今后一定尊敬老师，并积极向老师们提供意见，帮助老师进步。”
    教授们也愉快地保证好好学习，改造自己的思想和作风。他们已经组织了学习委员会，他们在大字报上写着：“听了周总理的报告，每个人都亲切地感到自己思想上存在着很多问题，它将妨碍个人进步，影响教学和师范大学的进步；因此，我们决定本着为人民服务，对革命负责的精神，坚决在上级的领导下进行自我改造。”地理系教授王钊衡说：“解放两年来我们的进步是赶不上国家文教建设需求的，在人民政府领导下，我保证要把学习搞好，把思想彻底澄清。”

    大学教师改造思想
    符合同学的要求编辑同志：北京、天津两市高等学校教师开展学习运动改造思想，不但符合于老师们的要求，而且也符合于我们全体同学的要求。
    我们常常觉得某些老师的讲课不能令人满意。他们在教学内容上，不是不切实际，就是观点上有问题。同学们往往提出很多意见，弄得教师左右为难。有的教师对旧的不敢批判，新的则不敢讲，只是讲些不关痛痒的东西。这样，不仅使同学的学习受到了影响，而且也影响了教师的教学情绪。当然，解放以后，尤其是在抗美援朝运动中，我们的教师已经有了一些进步。但他们的进步是很不够的，还远远落在客观要求的后面。我希望大学教师们，加紧学习，改造自己的思想，做一个人民教师。

    北京大学同学欢迎教师学习编辑同志：我们北京大学的学生对于高等学校教师们开展学习运动改造思想，表示热烈欢迎。我们认为这一运动的开展，对于高等教育的改造有着重大的意义。为此，北京大学通讯组于二十三日中午邀集各系同学代表十五人举行了一次座谈会。
    在座谈会上，同学代表热烈地发表了意见，认为：解放以后，教师们成立了工会组织，进行了政治学习，取得了部分成绩，但是他们的进步远赶不上客观的要求。他们在教学思想上还有着不少的缺点。过去曾经到欧美留过学的某些教师，保留着英、美资产阶级的思想残余。如果教师们不克服欧美反动资产阶级的思想残余，个人主义、庸俗的自由主义思想，以及“资本主义做底，马克思列宁主义镶边”的错误思想，是无法把自己的教学工作搞好的，不管是自然科学也好，社会科学也好。
    到会的同学代表都希望教师们在这次学习中能够以虚心的态度，展开批评与自我批评。在过去，有些教师是不够虚心的，如西语系有一位教授对另一位向他提意见的教授曾说：“各人自扫门前雪，我不管你，你也不用管我。”在这次学习中，有些教授已开始运用批评与自我批评这个武器了。在听了周总理的报告后，地质系小组王嘉荫教授批判了他过去的某些错误思想，潘钟祥教授也批判了“政治是龌龊的”错误看法。
    这次学习是从北京大学开始的。我们要求北京大学的教师们在这次思想改造中起带头作用，认真严肃地展开批评与自我批评，以达到改造思想和改革高等教育的目的。    北京大学通讯组
    我们要关心并帮助教师
    进行学习编辑同志：我看到北京、天津高等学校教师展开学习运动，改造思想的消息后，感到万分的兴奋。
    在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动中，教师们有了某些进步。但是，很多教师受过欧美资产阶级教育，因此，他们在教学上有许多缺点，例如：一，填鸭式的教学法，只顾灌输，而不去考虑同学能不能消化；二，把欧美的一套硬搬过来，而不结合国内情况；三，理论不联系实际，在课堂上夸夸其谈，可是不解决问题。这样也就不能满足广大同学的要求。
    今天，人民需要我们成为建设祖国有用的人材，而直接负责培养我们的，对我们影响最大的，就是我们的教师。因此，他们进行学习，改造思想，对同学们有着重大的关系。正如毛主席在人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上所说的：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”教师们只有认真学习，彻底改造思想，才能教好学生，才不至辜负人民殷切的期望。同学们应该关心并帮助教师进行学习。
