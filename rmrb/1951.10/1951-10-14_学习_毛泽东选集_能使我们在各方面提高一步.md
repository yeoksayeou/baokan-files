    Studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Can Enable Us to Improve in All Aspects

    To the Editor:
    The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been published! This is a major event in the political life of the Chinese people. The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is the crystallization of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. It not only tells us how Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to struggle, but also enables us to understand how Chairman Mao solved revolutionary problems in each historical period. It can not only enable us to improve theoretically and make judgments with greater foresight, but also enable us to have something to follow when carrying out all revolutionary work. Therefore, we must study the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" well.
    In addition to calling on every cadre to work harder to study Mao Zedong Thought in the future, we are also preparing to hold a conference around the 15th of this month, and comrades are willing to express their personal feelings about the publication of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" at the conference.

    学习“毛泽东选集”能使我们在各方面提高一步编辑同志：
    “毛泽东选集”出版了！这是中国人民政治生活中的重大事件。“毛泽东选集”是马列主义与中国革命实践相结合的结晶，它不仅告诉我们毛主席如何领导中国人民进行斗争，并能使我们了解在每一个历史时期，毛主席用什么方法解决革命问题。它不仅能使我们从理论上提高一步，判断问题更有预见；并能使我们在进行一切革命工作时，有所遵循。因此，我们对“毛泽东选集”，要好好学习。
    我们除了号召每个干部今后更要努力学习毛泽东思想之外，并准备于本月十五日左右，召开一次大会，同志们都愿意在大会上发表个人对“毛泽东选集”出版的感想。
