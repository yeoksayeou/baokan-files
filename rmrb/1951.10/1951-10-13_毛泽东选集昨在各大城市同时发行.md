The Selected Works of Mao Zedong were simultaneously released in major cities across the country yesterday. The release of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong in Shanghai broke all previous records for book releases. At the two retail outlets of the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore, the Shanghai Branch of the China Book Distribution Company, and the Shanghai Private Book Industry Joint Supply Office, long lines of readers had formed before the doors even opened. The two retail outlets of the Xinhua Bookstore were completely sold out by around 10:00 AM yesterday. A total of 30,000 copies of Volume I of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong were released in Shanghai yesterday, with 70% supplied to organized readers and 30% sold at retail outlets.

The 12,000 copies of Volume I of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong transported to Tianjin were also completely sold out yesterday. As early as 7:00 AM yesterday morning, hundreds of people were waiting in line in front of the Tianjin Branch of the Xinhua Bookstore and the Tianjin Branch of the China Book Distribution Company to buy the book. The retail stock of Volume I of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong at both bookstores was sold out in less than six hours. Until 7:00 PM in the evening, many readers were still registering with the bookstores to reserve copies.

In Wuhan, twelve outlets of seven bookstores released Volume I of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong yesterday. The first batch of Volume I of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong transported to Wuhan sold out in less than two hours, and more than 17,500 people have continued to reserve copies.

In Xi'an, bookstores originally planned to retail 5,000 copies of Volume I of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong throughout the day yesterday, but they sold out in just over an hour; and 4,000 people have continued to make reservations. Buyers included cadres from organizations, workers, students, professors, industrialists and businessmen, as well as rural cadres who traveled from thirty miles outside the city.

In the Northeast, 150,000 copies of Volume I of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong have been reprinted, but it is still far from meeting the demand. A few days ago, people crowded the Xinhua Bookstore to pre-order; in Shenyang, pre-orders had already exceeded the city's allocation by a factor of two several days ago.

    毛泽东选集昨在各大城市同时发行
    【本报讯】毛泽东选集昨日在全国各大城市同时发行。毛泽东选集在上海市的发行，打破了过去任何书籍所发行纪录。在上海新华书店两个门市部、中国图书发行公司上海分公司和上海市私营图书发行业联合供应处门未开前，读者已在门前排着很长的队伍。新华书店两个门市部在昨日上午十时左右就全部卖完。昨天上海发行的毛泽东选集第一卷共三万册。其中百分之七十供应有组织的读者，百分之三十在门市部发售。运到天津的毛泽东选集第一卷一万二千册，昨日也已全部售出。还在昨晨七时，新华书店天津分店和中国图书发行公司天津分公司门前就站了数百人的队伍等候买书。两书店毛泽东选集第一卷的零售数不到六小时即已售完。直到夜晚七时，许多读者还在向书店登记预约购书。武汉市昨天有七家书店的十二个门市部发行毛泽东选集第一卷。第一批运到武汉的毛泽东选集第一卷，不到两小时就已经卖完，继续预约购书的已达到一万七千五百多人。西安市各书店昨日原计划一天中零售毛泽东选集第一卷五千册，结果一个多钟头就卖完了；并续有四千人预约。买书的除了机关干部、职工、学生、教授、工商业者，还有自离城三十里外赶来的农村干部。毛泽东选集第一卷在东北已翻印了十五万册，但仍很不够需要。数日前，到新华书店预购的人就拥挤得很；沈阳在数日前预购数已超过分配给该市的一倍。
