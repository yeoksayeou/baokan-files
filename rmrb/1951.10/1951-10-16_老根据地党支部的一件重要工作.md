    An Important Task for Party Branches in Old Revolutionary Base Areas
    Chairman Mao's inscription for the people of the old revolutionary base areas, "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory!" was brought to various places by the visiting delegation to the old revolutionary base areas, giving new strength to the党员 (Party members) and the masses. For example, the Zhangjing Village branch in Ping顺县 (Pingshun County), Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, used Chairman Mao's inscription as a mobilization slogan for communist education, inspiring Party members to recall the history of the branch's leadership in the War of Resistance Against Japan, land reform, production and construction, as well as the struggle against the U.S. aggression and aid to Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. This made Party members deeply realize that to strive for greater glory, they must further enhance their class consciousness. The Communist Party branch of Nanweiquan Village in Licheng, Shanxi Province, has a history of fourteen years of struggle and has made great contributions to the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and land reform. Recently, however, there have been unprincipled disputes among the branch committee members. After discussing Chairman Mao's call, everyone realized that this was wrong and unanimously expressed their determination to strive for greater glory, resolutely complete the autumn patriotic production increase plan, and do a good job in armed construction, in order to further build and consolidate the great motherland. The Party organizations in the old revolutionary base areas should conduct in-depth education for all Party members based on Chairman Mao's call to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," inspire revolutionary consciousness, and encourage Party members to strive for higher standards of Party membership.

    老根据地党支部的一件重要工作
    毛主席亲笔给老根据地人民的题字：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣！”由老根据地访问团带到各地后，给各地的党员和群众以新的力量。例如山西长治专区平顺县张井村支部，以毛主席题字作为进行共产主义教育的动员口号，启发党员回忆支部领导抗战，土地改革，生产建设，以及抗美援朝，镇压反革命等斗争的历史，使党员深深感到要争取更大的光荣，必须进一步提高自己的阶级觉悟。山西黎城南委泉村共产党支部已有十四年斗争历史，无论对抗日斗争、解放战争、土地改革，都有很大的贡献，最近支委间却闹无原则纠纷。讨论毛主席的号召后，大家才认识这是错误的，一致表示要争取更大的光荣，坚决完成秋季爱国丰产计划，做好武装建设工作，以进一步建设与巩固伟大的祖国。老革命根据地的党组织应当根据毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的号召向全体党员进行深入教育，启发革命自觉，鼓励党员为更高的党员标准而斗争。
