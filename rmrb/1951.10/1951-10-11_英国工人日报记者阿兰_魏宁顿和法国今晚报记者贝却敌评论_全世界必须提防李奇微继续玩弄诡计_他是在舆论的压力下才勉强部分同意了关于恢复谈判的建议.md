Xinhua News Agency, October 10th -- Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker", reported from Kaesong on the 9th: Ridgway reluctantly and partially agreed to the proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides to resume negotiations as soon as possible; this does not prove that the US side has changed its mind, but rather proves the power of public opinion. When the Korean and Chinese sides suggested expanding the neutral zone to achieve genuine equality, Ridgway immediately discarded the "equality" he had previously demanded like a hot potato. He is still insisting on the stupid propaganda that the negotiations were delayed by the Korean and Chinese sides, not by his own encroachment on the neutral zone and refusal to resume negotiations. Ridgway himself demanded that Kaesong be designated as a neutral zone, in which the armed forces of the Korean and Chinese armies were restricted and military movements were declared illegal. However, from the past to the present, Munsan has been used to the fullest extent by the US side to assemble military forces. The only purpose of demanding the lifting of Kaesong's neutrality is obviously to try to write off the past events. But everyone knows that it was the US side that attempted to sabotage the negotiations with bombing and shooting, while the Korean and Chinese sides have been constantly suggesting an immediate resumption of negotiations. Although the efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides have made the resumption of negotiations imminent, judging from the US response, the US side still wants to continue its strategy of sabotaging negotiations. This is the only conclusion that can be drawn from Ridgway's own broadcast. After broadcasting Ridgway's letter, the "Voice of the United Nations" then threatened: "If negotiations resume, the 'Communists' must not create any more incidents, the idea of a ceasefire along the 38th parallel must be abandoned, and hostilities will continue as usual. At the same time, the 'Communists' must not think of getting a breather during the peace talks." People all over the world should continue to be vigilant and should not assume that the road will be smooth after the ingenuity and tolerance of the Korean and Chinese sides have removed some of the stumbling blocks to peace erected by the US side. On the side that produces tricks, there are still many tricks there.

Xinhua News Agency, October 10th -- Betchart, a reporter for the French "Ce Soir", commented on Ridgway's reply on the 8th in a telegram from Kaesong: Although the hard work of the Korean and Chinese sides has now cleared most of the obstacles to the immediate resumption of negotiations, the whole world must be wary of Ridgway's other tricks. Looking at the record of the negotiations so far, it can be seen that Ridgway, with the support of the incorrigible warmongers Joy, Van Fleet, and Kenney, has been trying to sabotage the meetings and expand the war. If negotiations restart, peace-loving people all over the world must be wary of them continuing to play these tricks.

What was the negotiation process like? For the first six weeks, Joy made excuses in the meeting room, proposing arrogant conditions and demanding 12,000 square kilometers of North Korean land without a fight. During these six weeks, Van Fleet assembled troops and supplies in preparation for a new offensive. When the final minute of preparation was completed, Ridgway's air force created an incident, Kenney lied that the Korean and Chinese sides had interrupted the negotiations, and then Van Fleet launched the offensive. But after months of costly battles, this offensive made no progress at all. At this time, the US side pretended to be willing to reopen negotiations. The liaison officer meetings actually continued for several days. But Kenney even attempted to sabotage these meetings, falsely accusing Colonel Zhang of "unilaterally" interrupting the meetings. A few days later, Van Fleet launched the largest American offensive since the war began. But this offensive was also stopped at the beginning. This is a rough outline of Ridgway's conception of armistice negotiations.

What about the past actions of the Korean and Chinese sides? The Korean and Chinese sides have unswervingly strived for the glorious peace that was suggested by Malik and accepted by the United States. The Korean and Chinese sides have suffered murderous bombing, strafing and attacks from the other side. When the United States finally admitted one of these incidents, the Korean and Chinese sides repeatedly suggested resuming negotiations immediately. This side continued to propose the location, date and time of the resumption meeting for four consecutive days. Ridgway concealed these suggestions from the world and rejected them. The Korean and Chinese sides did not conduct a single hostile action in the neutral zone or on the front lines, and with great patience, resisted American attacks only with their left hand. Finally, the Korean and Chinese sides, with perfect ingenuity and patience, eliminated one by one the obstacles created by Ridgway to the resumption of negotiations. However, it is clear that patience is limited, if Ridgway and his gang want to play these tricks again.

    全世界必须提防李奇微继续玩弄诡计
    他是在舆论的压力下才勉强部分同意了关于恢复谈判的建议
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿九日自开城报道：李奇微勉强部分地同意了朝中方面为尽可能迅速地恢复谈判而提出的建议；这并没有证明美方已回心转意，而是证明了舆论的力量。当朝中方面建议扩大中立区以达到真正平等的时候，李奇微立刻就把他以前所要求的“平等”像一个烫手的马铃薯一样丢开了；他还在坚持愚蠢的宣传说，谈判是朝中方面拖延的，而不是他自己侵犯中立区和拒绝恢复谈判。要求划开城为中立区，在这个中立区内，限制朝中军队的武装并宣布军事移动为非法的是李奇微自己，可是从过去到现在，汶山一直就为美方集结军事力量尽了最大的作用。要求解除开城中立性的唯一目的，显然是企图把过去的事件一笔抹去。可是人人都知道，企图用轰炸和射击来破坏谈判的是美方，而朝中方面却是不断建议立即恢复谈判的。虽然朝中方面的努力已使谈判的恢复又指日可期，但是从美方的反应看来，美方依然想继续他们的破坏谈判的策略。这是从李奇微自己的广播中所能推断出来的唯一的结论。“联合国之音”在广播李奇微这次的信以后，接着威胁说：“如果谈判恢复，‘共产党’决不可再制造任何事件，沿三八线停战的念头必须放弃，敌对行动将照常继续进行下去，同时‘共产党’万万不要想在和平谈判期间得到喘息的时间。”全世界人士应当继续提高警惕，不要以为朝中方面的机智和容忍除去了美方阻挠和平的一些绊脚石之后，道路就会是平坦的。在产生诡计的那一方面，仍然有着许许多多的诡计在那里。
     【新华社十日讯】法国今晚报记者贝却敌九日从开城发出的电讯评论李奇微八日的复信说：虽然朝中方面的辛苦努力现在已扫清了立即恢复谈判的大部分障碍，但是全世界必须提防李奇微的其他诡计。看一看到目前为止的谈判记录，就可以知道，李奇微在乔埃、范佛里特、和肯尼这三个怙恶不悛的战争贩子的拥护下，一直在设法破坏会议和扩大战争。如果谈判重新开始的话，全世界爱好和平的人必须提防他们继续耍这种手段。
    谈判经过是怎样的呢？头六个星期，乔埃在会议室借故留难，提出狂妄的条件，要求不战而获得一万二千平方公里北朝鲜的土地。在这六个星期里，范佛里特集结了兵力和供应，准备进行新的攻势。当最后一分钟的准备完成之后，李奇微的空军制造了事件，肯尼撒谎说朝中方面打断谈判，接着范佛里特发动了攻势。但是经过几个月代价巨大的战斗之后，这个攻势始终没有丝毫进展，这时美方又假意表示他们愿意重开谈判了。联络官会议实际上继续进行了好几天。但是，肯尼即使对这些会议也企图加以破坏，他扯谎攻击张上校“片面地”中断会议。几天以后，范佛里特发动了战争以来美国最巨大的攻势。但这个攻势也一开头就被遏止了。这便是李奇微对停战谈判的观念的粗略轮廓。
    朝中方面过去的所作所为又怎样呢？朝中方面坚持不渝地努力争取曾经由马立克建议并曾为美国接受的光荣的和平。朝中方面曾受到对方谋杀的轰炸、扫射和攻击。当美国最后承认其中的一次事件时，朝中方面就再三建议马上恢复谈判。这方面接连四天不断地提出复会的地点、日期和时间。李奇微在全世界面前隐瞒这些建议，并且拒绝了这些建议。朝中方面没有在中立区或战线上进行一次敌对行动，并怀着极大的忍耐，仅用左手抵抗美国的攻击。最后，朝中方面并以完美的机智和忍耐，一一地消除了李奇微对恢复谈判所制造的障碍。然而，显然忍耐是有限度的，如果李奇微那伙人还要来这一套花样的话。
