    [Report from this newspaper] Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, wrote a letter on the 18th of this month to Maurice Gauthier, Secretary-General of the International Transport Workers' Federation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, reporting on the Chinese people and railway workers' assistance to the Japanese patriotic workers arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident," the recent developments in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident," and suggested that the International Transport Workers' Federation mobilize all its member organizations and friendly groups to support the just struggle of the innocently arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident." The full text is as follows:

    Dear Comrade:

    In this letter, I will report to you on the spiritual and material assistance given by the Chinese people and railway workers to the Japanese patriotic workers arrested and imprisoned in the "Matsukawa Incident," the recent developments in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident," and our suggestions to the Trade Union International regarding the future development of this incident. If you deem it necessary, please consider forwarding this letter to all member organizations and friendly groups.

    (1) The Chinese people and railway workers' spiritual and material assistance to the Japanese patriotic workers arrested and imprisoned in the "Matsukawa Incident":

    Since the occurrence of the "Matsukawa Incident" on August 17, 1949, fabricated by the Japanese reactionary government by plagiarizing the Nazi German "Reichstag fire incident," it has aroused the greatest anger of the Chinese people and Chinese railway workers towards Japanese fascism. They believe that the Japanese Yoshida government's judicial organs' judgment on Suzuki Shin and other 20 people completely violates the Potsdam Proclamation and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission on the basic policy towards Japan after surrender. This judgment clearly indicates that the Japanese Yoshida government is a revival of Japanese fascist rule, seriously endangering the basic human rights of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, and is therefore completely illegal.

    Therefore, since January 1951, the entire Chinese people, mass organizations, trade union organizations, etc., have sent telegrams, letters, and donations to support the Japanese workers' struggle and resolutely protested against the Japanese reactionary government's unreasonable judgment. To date, more than 1,000 of these telegrams and letters have been sent to Japan.

    As far as we know, these telegrams and letters have greatly encouraged the Japanese workers, especially the patriotic workers who are struggling unyieldingly in prison, and given them confidence in victory. The funds we remitted have been used as a fund to support the movement of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and to increase their food nutrition and the living relief for their families.

    (2) Regarding the recent developments in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident":

    In late May of this year, Japanese progressive masses and groups successively held gatherings regarding the "Matsukawa Incident." At the meeting on May 29, it was decided to launch a signature campaign for the innocent release of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," collecting one million signatures, and at the same time raising a movement fund of one million yen. The meeting also decided to widely publicize the truth about the "Matsukawa Incident" to the Japanese people.

    The victims of the "Matsukawa Incident," although their health has been greatly damaged due to the harsh conditions in prison and prolonged prisoner life, they still persist in the struggle. They have continuously written letters to patriotic compatriots outside the prison, calling on everyone to rise up to defend peace and human rights and participate in the movement for the innocent release of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

    Not long ago, with the support of the Japanese and people all over the world, they have appealed to the Sendai Court of Appeal. The trial was originally scheduled to be held in July of this year, but was later changed to early September, and recently changed again to October 23. Why have the second trials been postponed several times? This is easy to understand, because the American imperialists had previously planned to complete preparations for war and enslavement of the Japanese people with a separate peace treaty in August of this year, but later had to postpone it to early September to hold the so-called "San Francisco Conference" to carry out the "signing" of the separate peace treaty. In this way, the Japanese government is obviously preparing to start the trial after the separate peace treaty is completed, to make it easier for them to crack down on Japanese patriotic workers and persecute them.

    The second trial will be held at the Sendai High Court, and will be judged by Judge Suzuki Sadajiro and Judges Sasaki and Takahashi.

    (3) Regarding the future development of the "Matsukawa Incident," our suggestions to the Trade Union International:

    Due to the above situation, the Chinese people and Chinese railway workers are prepared to launch another support movement for the "Matsukawa Incident" around the start of the second trial. At the same time, we also request you to relay this news to all member organizations and friendly groups of the International Transport Workers' Federation, so that workers all over the world can support them with greater strength (including material assistance).

        Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union Li Jiebo

    李颉伯致函陆空运输工人工会国际总书记莫拉鲁
    呼吁支援日本“松川事件”的无辜被捕者
    【本报讯】中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯于本月十八日写信给世界工会联合会陆空运输工人工会国际总书记莫拉鲁，报告关于中国人民及铁路工人援助因“松川事件”被捕的日本爱国工人的经过及关于日本“松川事件”最近的发展情况，并建议陆空运输工人工会国际发动一切会员组织及友好团体支援“松川事件”无辜被捕者的正义斗争。全文如下：亲爱的同志：
    在这一封信里，我将报告给你关于中国人民及铁路工人在精神上、物质上援助因“松川事件”被捕在狱中的日本爱国工人的经过，关于日本“松川事件”最近发展的情况以及我们就此事件以后的发展对工会国际的建议。如你认为必要的话，即请考虑将此信转发给一切会员组织及友好团体。
    （一）中国人民及铁路工人在精神上、物质上援助因“松川事件”被捕在狱中的日本爱国工人的经过：
    自从一九四九年八月十七日日本反动政府抄袭德国纳粹“国会纵火事件”而制造的“松川事件”发生以来，曾经引起了中国人民和中国铁路工人对日本法西斯最大的愤怒。他们认为：日本吉田政府司法机关对于铃木信等二十人的判决是完全违反了波茨坦公告及远东委员会公布的对投降后日本的基本政策的决议。这个判决明显地表示了日本吉田政府是日本法西斯统治的复活，严重地危害了日本工人阶级与日本人民的基本人权，因而也是完全非法的。
    因此，自一九五一年一月以来，全中国人民、各群众团体、工会组织等曾纷纷以电报信件和捐款支援日本工人的斗争，并坚决抗议日本反动政府的无理判决。迄今为止，这些电报、信件已有一千多封寄达日本。
    据我们所知，这些电报、信件曾大大地给予日本工人，尤其是在狱中坚持斗争不屈的爱国工人以莫大的鼓舞和获得胜利的信心。我们汇去的款项则已作为援助“松川事件”被告运动的基金和用以增加他们的食物营养及他们家属的生活救济金。
    （二）关于日本“松川事件”最近发展的情况：
    今年五月下旬，日本进步群众和团体曾连续举行关于“松川事件”的集会。在五月二十九日的会中决定发起“松川事件”被告无罪释放签名运动，征集一百万人的签名，同时并征募一百万日元的运动基金，会中还决定向日本人民广泛宣传“松川事件”的真相。
    “松川事件”的被难者，虽因狱中条件恶劣及长期的囚犯生活，健康大受损害，但他们依然坚持斗争，他们曾不断地向狱外爱国同胞写信，号召大家起来保卫和平和人权，参加“松川事件”被告无罪释放运动。
    不久以前，他们在日本和全世界人民支持下，已向仙台裁判所提出上诉，这个审判原订于今年七月间举行，但以后改于九月初，最近则又改在十月二十三日举行。为什么几次的延期第二次审判呢？这是很容易明了的，因为美帝国主义者以前曾经计划于今年八月完成准备战争和奴役日本人民的单独媾和，后来又不得不延期于九月初举行所谓“旧金山会议”，以进行单独媾和的“签字”。这样日本政府显然是准备在完成单独媾和以后再开始审判，以更便于他们向日本爱国工人开刀和进行迫害。
    第二审将于仙台高等裁判所举行，由铃木祯次郎裁判长和佐佐木、高桥两裁判官审判。
    （三）就“松川事件”以后的发展，我们对工会国际的建议：
    由于以上情况，中国人民和中国铁路工人已准备在第二审开始前后，再一次展开对“松川事件”的支援运动，同时我们也提请你把这个消息转告陆空运输工人工会国际一切会员组织及友好团体，以便全世界工人以更大的力量（包括物质上的援助）支援他们。
