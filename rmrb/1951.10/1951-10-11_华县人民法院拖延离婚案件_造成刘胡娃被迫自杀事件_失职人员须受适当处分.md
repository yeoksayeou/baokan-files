The Huaxian People's Court in Shaanxi Province delayed the resolution of Liu Huwa's divorce case, leading to the woman's forced suicide.

Liu Huwa was from Dujiawan Village, Sixth District, Huaxian County. In February 1947, she married Du Changwa from the same district. After the marriage, she had an unhappy relationship with her husband and was frequently subjected to abuse by her mother-in-law and beatings by Du Changwa. Unable to endure it any longer, Liu Huwa filed a lawsuit with the Huaxian People's Court on May 25, 1950, requesting a divorce.

After accepting the case, the Huaxian People's Court did not hold its first hearing until June 26th. The man was not present that day. Kang Lin, the acting judge of the court handling the case, only wrote a letter to the township head, Wang Hao, asking him to "mediate," and then stopped paying attention to the matter. Township Head Wang Hao ignored the letter. On July 1st, Liu Huwa went to the court to urge action, but Kang Lin still did not take it seriously, only writing a letter to the district government, entrusting them to handle it on his behalf. The district government summoned both parties on July 11th, but Du Changwa again failed to appear. On July 16th, Du Changwa, along with his father, the village head, and two others, went to Liu Huwa's parents' home, beat her severely, dragged her by her legs for several yards on the ground, and forced her to return to her in-laws' home. Township Head Wang Hao not only failed to stop this illegal behavior but also ordered the village head to send militiamen to forcibly escort Liu Huwa back to her in-laws' home. The next day (July 17th), Liu Huwa's mother, Wang Qin, reported this to the county People's Court. Acting Judge Kang Lin reported the situation to the deputy director of the court. The deputy director instructed: on the one hand, send a letter to the district government to stop the illegal act of insulting and beating women; on the other hand, call the district government and tell them that if the matter cannot be resolved, both the man and woman should be sent to the court. However, Kang Lin was perfunctory and only wrote a note, giving it to Liu Huwa's mother to take to the district government. He also failed to call the district government to explain the situation. Liu Chunshan, the secretary of the district government, lost the letter and did not deal with it afterwards, and the court did not supervise or inspect the matter. From then on, Liu Huwa's mother-in-law became even more unscrupulous, and on August 26th, she again verbally abused Liu Huwa and incited Du Changwa to beat her severely. Liu Huwa felt she had no way out and hanged herself that night.

After this incident occurred, the Huaxian People's Court did not report it to higher authorities, nor did it make any arrangements for handling the aftermath, and the perpetrators were not given the punishment they deserved. When Shaanxi Province held a judicial conference, the provincial People's Court collected materials on cases of deaths resulting from marriage disputes in order to study and implement issues in the Marriage Law. However, the Huaxian People's Court still did not pay attention to Liu Huwa's case and therefore did not report it to the provincial People's Court. It was only after the Shaanxi Provincial People's Court discovered the case that it ordered the court to conduct a review of the serious dereliction of duty in this case. However, the court's review was not thorough, and it did not recognize that the serious irresponsibility of the personnel involved was the main reason for the death. The Huaxian People's Court and the relevant district and township cadres' disregard for women's interests is intolerable, and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Court should deal with this seriously.

    华县人民法院拖延离婚案件
    造成刘胡娃被迫自杀事件
    失职人员须受适当处分
    陕西省华县人民法院对刘胡娃离婚案拖延不决，致女方被迫自杀。
    刘胡娃是华县六区杜家垣村人。一九四七年二月与同区杜长娃结婚。婚后与丈夫感情不和，并常遭婆母的辱骂和杜长娃的殴打。刘胡娃忍无可忍，于一九五○年五月二十五日向华县人民法院起诉请求离婚。
    华县人民法院受理该案后，至六月二十六日才首次开庭。当日男方没有到庭。该院承办此案的代理审判员康麟，只给乡长王皡写了封让其“予以调解”的信，便不再闻问了。而乡长王皡见信后又置之不理。七月一日，刘胡娃到法院催案，康麟仍未予以重视，只给该区区政府写信，委托代为处理。区政府于七月十一日传讯双方，此次杜长娃又未到案。七月十六日，杜长娃和他的父亲、村长等四人到刘胡娃娘家，将胡娃痛打一顿，并拉住胡娃两腿在地上拖了几丈远，强迫她回婆家。乡长王皡对这种非法行为不但不加制止，反命令该村村长派民兵将刘胡娃强制送回婆家。次日（十七日），刘胡娃的母亲王勤才报告县人民法院，康麟代理审判员将此情况汇报该院副院长。副院长指示：一面给区政府去函制止辱打妇女的非法行为；一面叫打电话告诉区政府，如不能解决，即将男女双方一并送院。而康麟敷衍塞责，仅写一便函，交刘胡娃的母亲带给区政府，也没有给区政府打电话交代。区政府秘书刘春善又遗失了这封信，事后也未予处理，法院也没有督促检查。从此刘胡娃的婆母益加无所忌惮，于八月二十六日又对刘胡娃大肆辱骂，并唆使杜长娃把她痛殴一顿。刘胡娃觉得再无生路，当晚自缢而死。
    这一事件发生后，华县人民法院一直未向上级报告，也没作善后处理，对行凶罪犯未给以应得的惩罚。陕西省召开司法会议时，省人民法院曾搜集有关因婚姻纠纷而发生命案的材料，以便研究贯彻婚姻法中的问题。而华县人民法院竟仍未重视刘胡娃一案，因而也未向省人民法院呈报。后经陕西省人民法院发现，始令该院就本案的严重失职行为进行检讨。但该院的检讨很不深刻，没有认识到承办人员对人民不负责任的严重错误，是酿成命案的主要原因。华县人民法院及有关的区乡干部漠视妇女利益的行为，已不能容忍，陕西省人民法院应对此作严肃处理。
