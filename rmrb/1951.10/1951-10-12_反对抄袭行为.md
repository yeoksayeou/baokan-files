    Opposing Plagiarism

    To the Editor:

    My translation of Makarenko's "The Education of Children in the Family and at School" was published serially in "People's Education" last year. Later, I asked someone else to revise the improper parts based on the original text and submitted it to Zhongwai Publishing House for publication. Recently, I discovered that Huoxing Publishing House also has a book with the same title, printed as published in May of this year (in fact, it was not released until August 26th), and the translator is Shao Mianyu. I bought a copy and compared it with the Zhongwai Publishing House version and found that the Huoxing Publishing House version is copied from "People's Education" from beginning to end. Except for changing a few function words, it is exactly the same as my translation published in "People's Education" magazine. This illegal act of blatant plagiarism of other people's labor achievements not only harms the translator's rights and interests but also damages the original publisher's rights and interests. This is an irresponsible act towards the people.

    Wang Menghua

    Editor's Note: Huoxing Publishing House should be responsible for responding to the matter pointed out in Comrade Wang Menghua's letter.

专栏：读者来信

    反对抄袭行为编辑同志：
    我翻译的马卡连柯所作“家庭与学校的儿童教育”，曾于去年在“人民教育”上陆续发表过。后来又请别人将其中不妥当的地方，根据原文加以修正，交给中外出版社出版。最近发现火星社也有一本，书上印着是本年五月出版（事实上八月二十六日才发行），译者是邵勉予。我买了一本和中外出版社的版本校阅一遍，发现火星社的版本从头到尾是从“人民教育”抄袭来的。除去改了几个虚字以外，完全和我在“人民教育”杂志上发表的译文一模一样。这种公然剽窃他人劳动成果的非法行为，不仅损害译者的权益，同时也损害原出版社的权益。这是对人民不负责任的表现。
    汪孟华
    编者按：关于汪孟华同志来信所指出的这件事情，火星社应该负责答复。
