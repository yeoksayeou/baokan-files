    We Must Fight for Peace in the East and the West
    Yiezi Putelamante, Vice Chairman of the Polish Peace Committee, Member of the World Peace Council
    The Polish peace defenders celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China as one of the most joyous days in the world's democratic peace camp. Because the victory of the Chinese people and the founding of the People's Republic of China is a day of great significance in world history.
    Poland is far away from China, but in our country, the concern for your great country, the joy for the Chinese people, and the sympathy and love for you are growing day by day.
    Poland and China are engaged in a common struggle, have common friends, and also have a common enemy.
    For decades, the greedy and brutal British, French, and American imperialists have shamelessly exploited our country, plundered the people's property, and plunged the people into darkness and poverty. Not long ago, the bloody Japanese imperialists invaded your country, and two or three years later, Poland was filled with armed Hitler bandits. Your people and our people have waged heroic struggles to win the freedom of their countries and to oppose the traitors who sold out their countries—the big bourgeoisie and feudal landlords.
    Today, the destinies of our two countries are very similar. Liberated from the reactionary rule at home and abroad, the people of our two countries are building a happy and joyful future. Our two countries are suffering from the same enemy—American imperialism.
    As the actions of the American warmongers in recent weeks have proven, they are relying on the fascist forces that the people of the world fought stubbornly against not long ago, and are planning to launch a third world war. The American imperialists are not satisfied with armed aggression against Korea, invading China, and occupying Taiwan. Moreover, they signed a war treaty in San Francisco, showing the world that they intend to revive the Japanese aggressor army that caused bloody massacres and heavy disasters to the Chinese people. A few days later, the American warmonger Acheson forced his satellite countries—Britain and France—to agree to restore the new Hitler bandit army.
    The people of our two countries have not forgotten the disasters suffered by the Japanese and German armies. The people of our two countries will never agree to allow the Japanese, German, and American bandits to re-invade and ravage our land. The people of our two countries will spare no effort to crush the conspiracy of the American warmongers.
    The cause of peace will surely triumph. The reason why it will surely triumph is because there are also people in capitalist countries in the peace camp who do not want to destroy themselves for the interests of big capital, and because there are also enslaved people in our camp who are heroically fighting against the colonialists for their liberation.
    The just cause, the cause of peace, will surely triumph, because the people of the whole world are with us, the great Soviet Union is with us. Under the leadership of its brilliant leader Stalin, the Soviet Union has defeated the Japanese and German aggressors. The Soviet Union, with its own example and friendly assistance, has helped the people of our two countries build a new life. Today, the Soviet Union is firmly fighting for world peace.
    The people of our two countries, hand in hand with the Soviet Union, will surely be able to crush the conspiracies of the warmongers in the East and the West. (With picture)

    我们要在东方和西方为争取和平而斗争
    波兰和平委员会副主席世界和平理事会理事  耶齐·普特拉曼特
    波兰的和平保卫者把中华人民共和国成立两周年纪念日，作为世界和平民主阵营中最愉快的一日来庆祝。因为中国人民的胜利和中华人民共和国底成立，乃是世界历史上具有重大意义的一个日子。
    波兰距离中国很远，可是在我们的国内对你们伟大国家的关切，为中国人民的欢欣以及对你们的同情与热爱，正在日益扩大着。
    波兰和中国正进行着共同的斗争，有着共同的朋友，也有着一个共同的敌人。
    贪婪而凶残的英、法、美帝国主义，数十年来一直在厚颜无耻地剥削我们的国家，掠夺人民的财产，使人民陷于黑暗与穷困的境地。不久以前，血腥的日本帝国主义者曾经侵犯你们的国家，往后过了两三年，波兰国内也布满了武装的希特勒强盗。你们的人民和我们的人民曾经为争取自己国家的自由，反对出卖国家的叛徒——大资产阶级和封建地主而进行了英勇的斗争。
    今天，我们两国的命运是非常相像的。从国内及国外的反动统治下解放出来的我们两国人民，正在建设着幸福的和快乐的未来。我们两国正遭受着同一的敌人——美国帝国主义的威胁。
    正如美国战争贩子最近几星期来的行动所证明的，他们正依靠着不久以前全世界人民与之顽强斗争的法西斯力量，打算发动第三次世界大战。美帝国主义者并不以武装侵略朝鲜、侵犯中国、占领台湾为满足，而且在旧金山签订了战争条约，向全世界表明，他们打算把曾使中国人民遭受血腥屠杀和重重灾难的日本侵略军复活起来。在这以后，过了没有几天，美国战争贩子艾奇逊就迫使他的卫星国家——英国和法国——同意恢复新的希特勒匪军。
    我们两国人民，并没有忘记日本军队和德国军队使我们遭受到的灾难。我们两国人民永远不能同意听任日本、德国和美国的强盗们重新侵犯和蹂躏我们的土地。我们两国人民对于粉碎美国战争贩子底阴谋，是绝不吝惜任何力量的。
    和平事业一定胜利。其所以一定胜利，是因为在和平阵营中也有资本主义国家的人民，他们不愿意为大资本利益而毁灭自己，是因为在我们的阵营中也有被奴役的人民，他们正在英勇地为争取自己的解放对殖民者进行着斗争。
    正义的事业，和平的事业一定胜利，这是因为全世界的人民都和我们在一起，伟大的苏联和我们在一起，苏联在其天才的领袖斯大林领导之下，已经击溃了日本和德国的侵略者，苏联以自己的榜样和友谊的援助，帮助我们两国人民建设新的生活，今天苏联正在坚定不移地为争取全世界和平而斗争。
    我们两国人民和苏联一起手牵着手，一定能粉碎战争贩子在东方和西方的阴谋。（附图片）
