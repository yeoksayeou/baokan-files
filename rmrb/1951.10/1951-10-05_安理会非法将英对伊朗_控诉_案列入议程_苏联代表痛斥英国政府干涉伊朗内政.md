    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd: According to TASS, the Security Council met on October 1st at the request of the United Kingdom. Chairman Muniz (Brazil) read the British government's letter requesting the meeting and said: The Security Council's task is to proceed with the agenda proposed by the United Kingdom—"Accusation that the Iranian government has not complied with the International Court of Justice's provisional recommendations regarding the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company case."
    The British proposal, submitted on September 29, "accuses" Iran of not complying with the Hague International Court of Justice's decision of July 5, which held that Britain should be allowed to manage Iranian oil fields until the "Anglo-Iranian dispute" is finally resolved. Iran rejected the International Court of Justice's decision because its dispute with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was a domestic matter, and therefore the decision was an interference in Iranian internal affairs. However, the British proposal demands that Iran comply with the International Court of Justice's decision and allow British personnel to continue residing in Abadan.
    The first to speak was Soviet Representative Tsarapkin, who said: The Soviet delegation believes it must point out that the British government's request that the Security Council consider its accusation against Iran constitutes interference in Iran's internal affairs and infringement of the Iranian people's sovereignty. Issues such as the nationalization of Iran's oil industry, the operation of oil companies by foreigners within Iranian territory, and the residence of foreign personnel in Iranian territory are entirely within the purview of the Iranian government's authority.
    Tsarapkin pointed out: Considering the British accusation violates one of the most important principles of the United Nations Charter, contained in Article 2, Paragraph 7, which prohibits the United Nations from considering any matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any state. The Soviet delegation believes that the British accusation indeed constitutes interference in Iranian internal affairs and infringes upon the sovereignty of the Iranian people; therefore, this provisional agenda cannot be adopted.
    British Representative Jebb said: The question of whether the Security Council is qualified to discuss this proposal should be left for later determination; the Security Council should agree to adopt the agenda at this time.
    The representatives of Ecuador, Turkey, India, the Netherlands, France, and the United States, as well as the Kuomintang elements, supported including the British accusation on the agenda. After this, the Chairman called for a vote on the issue of adopting the agenda. The representatives of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia voted against the aforementioned agenda, while the remaining nine votes were in favor. The Security Council ultimately decided to postpone the debate for ten days at the request of Iranian Representative Ataron, because the Iranian representative would need ten days to arrive.

    安理会非法将英对伊朗“控诉”案列入议程
    苏联代表痛斥英国政府干涉伊朗内政
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社纽约二日讯：安全理事会应英国的请求于十月一日开会。主席慕尼兹（巴西）宣读英国政府要求开会的信件，并说：安理会的工作是通过英国所提出的议程——“控诉伊朗政府没有遵守国际法院关于英伊石油公司案件的临时建议。”
    英国在九月二十九日所提出的议案“控诉”伊朗没有遵守海牙国际法院七月五日的决定，该决定认为应准许英国在“英伊争端”获得最后解决以前，管理伊朗油田。伊朗拒绝了国际法院的决定，因为它和英伊石油公司的纠纷是国内问题，因此这一决定是对伊朗内政的干涉。可是，英国的议案要求伊朗遵守国际法院的决定，并准许英国人员继续居住在阿巴丹。
    第一个发言的是苏联代表查拉普金，他说：苏联代表团认为必须指出：英国政府请求安全理事会考虑它对于伊朗的控诉，就是干涉伊朗的内政和侵犯伊朗人民的主权。像伊朗石油工业国有化问题、外国在伊朗领土内经营石油公司问题和外国人员在伊朗领土居留等问题，完全是伊朗政府权力范围以内的问题。
    查拉普金指出：考虑英国的控诉，就违反了联合国宪章第二条第七款所载的联合国宪章中最重要的原则之一，这就是禁止联合国考虑任何国家国内管辖的任何事务。苏联代表团认为英国控诉确实构成了对伊朗内政的干涉，并侵犯了伊朗人民的主权，因此，不能通过这个临时议程。
    英国代表杰伯说：安理会是否有资格讨论这个议案的问题，应留待以后决定，安理会此时应同意通过议程。
    厄瓜多尔、土耳其、印度、荷兰、法国和美国代表以及国民党分子，赞成把英国控诉列入议程。在这以后，主席要求就通过议程的问题举行表决。苏联和南斯拉夫的代表投票反对上述议程，其余的九票赞成该项议程。安理会最后应伊朗代表阿特龙的要求，决定延期十天辩论，因为伊朗代表要十天才能到达。
