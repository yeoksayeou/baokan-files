Xinhua News Agency, October 13th dispatch from Cairo: The Egyptian government has decided to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which stipulates British occupation of the Suez Canal Zone, and the agreement on the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium of Sudan. On the 8th, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas submitted a bill to the House of Representatives stipulating the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty concluded in 1936 and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan concluded in 1899. The Egyptian Senate Committee and the House of Representatives party committees responsible for studying the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty passed the bill proposed by Nahas on the 9th and 10th respectively.

　　Citizens of Cairo, the capital of Egypt, held large-scale anti-imperialist demonstrations on the 9th and 10th. In the demonstrations on the 9th, protesters expressed their support for the Egyptian government's decision to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets in formation. They held flags with the words: "Oppose Imperialism, Oppose Negotiations." "British Get Out of Egypt!" The protesters shouted slogans such as "Down with British Imperialism!" and "Egypt, Stand Up!" People in other parts of Egypt, such as Alexandria and Port Said, also held demonstrations of the same nature on the 9th. According to a Telepress dispatch: On the 10th, about 100,000 people in Cairo held anti-imperialist demonstrations, including 6,000 students. Egyptian workers and students support the Egyptian government's decision to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and expel the British troops in Egypt, and called for a general strike to be held on the 18th. Cairo's "Al-Ahram" newspaper said that Egyptian workers have indicated that they will stop working for the British troops in the Canal Zone. In Alexandria, people suggested on the 10th that the city council cancel the English names of the streets.

　　The anti-imperialist movement of the Egyptian people is a heavy blow to the imperialist war preparations in the Near East and the Middle East. The British "Daily Telegraph" admitted on the 11th that the actions of the Egyptians "have hindered all planned arrangements for the establishment of a Middle East security pact."
　
　　Xinhua News Agency, October 13th dispatch from London, TASS: The British Daily Worker, in discussing the Egyptian issue, exposed the absurd claim that the British garrison in the Suez Canal Zone is essential for "the security of Egypt." The newspaper pointed out that although the treaty now condemned by Egypt only stipulates that 10,000 troops be stationed in the Canal Zone, there are now as many as 100,000 British troops concentrated there. The Daily Worker said: "The Labor government strengthened the Suez base as its main base for attacking the Soviet Union." Now the Labor government, together with the United States, intends to make Egypt a common base for the Atlantic countries to launch a war against the Soviet Union. The Daily Worker said: "This will be a case of old wine in new bottles, and foreign military occupation will remain the same as before." The newspaper then pointed out: The Egyptian people want neither British occupation nor American occupation.

    埃及决定废除英埃条约和共管苏丹协定
    开罗十万市民举行反英示威游行
    游行者高呼：“埃及站起来！”“英国人滚出埃及去！”
    【新华社十三日讯】开罗消息：埃及政府已决定废除规定英国占领苏彝士运河区的英埃条约和关于英埃共管苏丹的协定。埃及首相纳哈斯八日向众院提出一个法案，规定废除一九三六年订立的英埃条约和一八九九年订立的英埃共管苏丹的协定。负责研究废除英埃条约问题的埃及参院委员会和众院各党委员会，先后在九日和十日通过了纳哈斯提出的法案。
    埃及首都开罗的市民，在九、十两日举行了大规模的反帝示威游行。在九日的示威游行中，游行者对埃及政府废除英埃条约的决定表示支持。成千成万的游行示威者列队通过大街。他们手拿旗帜，上面写着：“反对帝国主义、反对谈判。”“英国人滚出埃及去！”游行者高呼“打倒英帝国主义！”
    “埃及站起来！”等口号。埃及其他地方如亚历山大港和塞得港的人民，也在九日举行了同样性质的示威游行。据电通社讯：十日，开罗约有十万人举行了反帝示威游行，内有学生六千人。埃及工人和学生支持埃及政府废除英埃条约和驱逐英国在埃及的军队的决定，并号召在十八日举行总罢工。开罗 “金字塔报”说：埃及工人已表示要停止替英国在运河区的军队工作。在亚历山大，人们在十日建议市参议会取消各街道的英文名字。
    埃及人民的反帝运动对帝国主义在近东和中东的备战计划，是一个沉重的打击。英国“每日电讯报”十一日承认：埃及人的行动“使得建立中东安全公约的一切计划中的布置受到阻碍”。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社伦敦十二日讯：英国工人日报在论到埃及问题时，揭发了所谓英国驻军苏彝士运河区对“埃及的安全”至为必要的妄谬说法。该报指出：虽然现在被埃及所谴责的条约上只规定一万军队驻在运河区，但是现在竟有十万英国军队集中在那里。工人日报说：“工党政府加强苏彝士基地作为它攻击苏联的主要据点。”现在工党政府和美国一道，打算使埃及成为大西洋国家对苏联发动战争的共同根据地。工人日报说：“这将是
    一种换汤不换药的办法，外国的军事占领仍将和从前一样。”该报接着指出：埃及人民既不要英国的占领，也不要美国的占领。
