    Editor's Note: On September 20, 1951, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese News, Publishing, and Printing Workers' Union held a symposium at the Cultural Club of Zhongshan Park in Beijing to welcome Ehrenburg. Ehrenburg enthusiastically reported on his writing experience and answered some questions raised by Chinese journalists. The following is the main part of the symposium record.
    Based on numerous symposium experiences, I am extremely regretful that I cannot speak Chinese. I do not intend to say anything bad about the translation comrades; I often work as a translator myself, so I know how difficult translation work is. In particular, I realize that the reason why my words are difficult to translate is that I often express either love or hatred in my conversations. However, I think no one has ever expressed love through translation; such couples do not exist. At the same time, I think no one scolds people through translation either—therefore, translating my words is very difficult. I am a writer, but I also work as a journalist. I think such a strict distinction is impossible. True, some countries' writers look down on journalists and despise them a bit. This is wrong because it is always better to be a good journalist than a bad writer. However, being an excellent writer does not necessarily mean being a better journalist… Generally speaking, writers participating in newspaper work will make the newspaper more lively. We have a literary newspaper in our country, and this newspaper is mainly written by writers. In essence, this newspaper is political, but it is much more lively than other newspapers. People also prefer to read it. This newspaper rarely uses official language to write articles.
    So, what are the benefits of being a journalist for a writer?
    A journalist, if he is a good journalist, will see life very clearly. Therefore, any good journalist who carefully contemplates the things he observes can write novels.
    I am not saying that every novelist can become a journalist and write articles.
    On the other hand, what are the disadvantages of engaging in journalistic work for a writer? Only one: if he starts writing with bad newspaper language.
    I do not know the characteristics of Chinese news work and the problems that everyone urgently needs to solve. I will talk as if the people sitting in front of me are my compatriots—Soviet journalists—and they are asking me to exchange experiences.
    Readers certainly have brains, and we are striving to make them work better. However, readers also have a heart. Journalists often forget this point; they only pay attention to people's reason and not to their emotions. A journalist should not only pay attention to the reader's reason but also to the reader's emotions.
    When a young man writes a letter to the girl he likes and loves, he will feel that she is appearing in front of him and try to find words and images that can move her heart.
    When a bad journalist writes an article—I mean a bad journalist—does he see the reader he wants to move as if they are in front of him?
    What he often sees is not the editor-in-chief, so he tries to please not the reader but the editor-in-chief. He strives to study the editor-in-chief's preferences. He understands what the editor-in-chief likes and dislikes. Therefore, he often forgets that his writing is not for the editor-in-chief but for the reader he wants to move.
    The same is true for style and language.
    Everyone has his own tone. When a person is sitting in the next room, we will know who he is. We say, this is our friend or acquaintance speaking.
    Precisely because we are communists, we do not obliterate individuality. On the contrary, we strive to develop individuality.
    A bad journalist does not strive to use his own words to speak but uses some kind of language that he considers polite—formulaic, vulgar, and rigid.
    I have asked myself, why were the articles I wrote during the war welcomed by our soldiers? That is because I spoke in my own words.
    Behind the articles, they could see people talking to each other—this is the most important thing.
    Now, let me say a few more words about language. However, this is based on Russian experience or Western European experience. In China, it may be a completely different condition; other people's troubles may seem ridiculous to you.
    The worst thing about European newspapers is that the language they use is much poorer than the language of the people.
    If any of you study Russian and can read Russian newspapers, it is best not to think that you understand Russian.
    The British, I am referring to the British imperialists, on the eve of the war, planned to create a poor "basic English" for foreigners they wanted to colonize.
    It is possible to use this basic language to write orders such as "Who is allowed to pass through the city, and who is not allowed to pass through," but it is impossible to use it to write "Hamlet." In short, it is impossible to express human thought.
    Bad journalists in Czech, Russian, French, and Polish write in "basic Russian," "basic French," and "basic Czech." Their vocabulary is very insufficient.
    Sometimes, in this regard, the editor-in-chief also makes mistakes.
    Some editors-in-chief are accustomed to certain phrases and believe that they should always use these phrases. If they encounter new phrases, they erase them and replace them with those prescribed phrases.
    I remember that the poet Simonov once wrote a poem called "Wait for Me," which was extremely popular in the army and was translated into Chinese. It was a letter from a soldier to the woman he loved, in which the soldier asked her to wait for him.
    At that time, this poem was very needed. Although this poem was not very rich in poetic meaning, it had a poetic image.
    In this poem, there is a short line: "Wait for me! When the yellow rain brings sorrow."
    I happened to go to the editor-in-chief's office, and at this time, the editor-in-chief was about to erase the words "yellow rain."
    The editor-in-chief said: "Yellow rain" has never been used. It is always "gloomy rain," "long rain." Why use "yellow rain"?
    I believe that every one of us has seen that when it rains heavily and the soil is clay, then the rainwater is like yellow.
    Our country has many yellow lands, and the newspaper editor-in-chief has probably also seen yellow rain. He saw it in life, not in the newspaper. So, if he picks up a pen and writes, we have to spend a lot of effort to stop his hand.
    Bad journalists always abuse the same methods.
    Every method can cause people's thoughts for the first time, and after the reader gets used to it, he no longer pays attention to it.
    The first time it is said, for example, "lackeys of Wall Street," it gives an impression. However, after the reader has read it hundreds of times, he will not pay attention to it.
    Sometimes, when you read the articles of bad journalists, you will have the impression that he is forcing the typesetter to work for no reason. Because there is no need to typeset at all. Just move many whole sentences from other places.
    There is a famous Czech writer named Karel Čapek. He has a funny story. I will briefly talk about it.
    He said that there was a scholar who found a method of identifying thoughts by evoking concepts.
    The method is this: if a word is said to someone, then another similar word will be generated in his thinking.
    Therefore, a person should speak without thinking. The professor said a word, and the person being asked should immediately say another word.
    He had experimented with a person who was suspected of being a murderer. He said: "Road." The murderer replied: "Field." He said: "Forest." The murderer said: "Valley." He said: "Hoe." The murderer said: "Pit." So, he found the dead man buried in the pit by the murderer.
    Everyone saw that he had achieved great success, so he suggested doing a public performance to test it. Many people attended. So he asked: "Who is willing to do the experiment?" He said: "Road." The person experimenting replied: "Broad road of progress." He said: "Dense clouds." The person replied: "Dark dense clouds of reaction." He said: "Wheel." The person replied: "Wheel of history."
    He answered all the questions with ready-made sentences from the newspaper. He had not said any of his own thoughts. So the professor said: "I admit that I failed. The first failure in a hundred experiments. But, please tell me, what is your name?" He said: "How can you not know? I am a famous journalist."
    Therefore, I think that all of us, no matter which country we are born in, should fight against the so-called "worn-out five kopecks." Worn-out five kopecks are an image that is already outdated, a currency that has already been used. ……………
    Now I want to talk about the necessity of being brief, concise, and succinct. A newspaper is not a lengthy novel. People want to read the newspaper quickly and while they are moving.
    Be good at writing briefly. This is more difficult than writing at length.
    Some people do not understand this.
    For example, the editor-in-chief calls me and says: "Please write an article." I say: "No, I don't have time." But he says: "Please write a very short one..." He doesn't understand that writing a short article takes more time than writing a long article.
    I think all of you should have this skill, because your Chinese ancient poems have the advantage of being concise. Chinese poetry is very concise.
    I would like to explain this with a laughable memory from my life. This was a long time ago, in my youth. I had a friend who was rich, and I was a poor man. I could often get money from him.
    But rich people are not like cows. The more you milk them, the harder it is to squeeze them out. Milking a cow requires milking it to the end; otherwise, it will give less. But if you squeeze a rich man in the same way, then he will give less and less.
    I went to another city. I didn't have a penny on me, so I wanted to borrow some money from this friend and wanted him to send me some money.
    I decided to send him a telegram. I wanted to write it in a way that could move his cold heart. But I understood that if I wrote a very long telegram, then I would starve to death before I could wait for the money to be sent... because every word had to be paid for. In my life, I have never spent so much time writing any work as I did writing this telegram draft. I had to solve a difficult problem: express the greatest amount of emotion with the fewest number of words—this is the task of journalists and writers.
    Unfortunately, in our place, journalists are paid for extra words. The more words, the more稿费[royalties]. If they were required to pay for each extra word, then maybe they would write better.
    This is a short opinion on our journalistic profession based on my own experience that I want to discuss with you.
    Now I invite you to ask me questions. If I can answer them, I will answer them.

Question: Mr. Ehrenburg, how do you prepare for an interview? How do you collect data? How do you analyze the object and how do you judge unfamiliar situations?

Answer:
    There are many questions. It may take several hours to talk about this. I will try to answer very briefly in a few words. I will talk about trivial things. Maybe these trivial things can help make a more concrete summary.
    A clumsy photographer, when he takes pictures of people, he corrects their posture for a long time. He says: Turn your head a little to the left and make a spirited posture! Then he takes a picture of him. As a result, the person being photographed is no longer like himself, but like someone else.
    When a clumsy journalist talks to people, he holds a notebook in his hand to record. When the person talking sees that someone is recording his words, he no longer says what he thinks in his heart. The journalist will not hear anything vivid from his mouth; he will only say what should be said.
    Therefore, I would like to suggest to young journalists not to record what they hear in front of the person they are talking to, but to record everything they hear afterward.
    Comrades asked how to collect data.
    Library data should not be collected when writing an article but should be collected a long time ago. Journalists can take notes in the library and record what they feel is interesting in their notebooks. This is his business.
    He has evenings at his disposal and he can read. Maybe it will be useful after two years, but he should still read it.
    It is not okay to run to the library only when you need to write an article, because there is no time.
    Excellent journalists can write articles on the evening before the newspaper is published. At this time, only a notebook is his data, his library.
    Comrades asked, what should I do when I go to a strange country?
    The French say: An Englishman crossed the English Channel to Calais and saw a brown-haired French woman, so he wrote: All French women are brown-haired.
    A French writer went to Russia in the last century, and then he wrote that he had tea under a dense raspberry tree. The raspberry tree is a small fruit tree that does not exist in France, only in Russia. This tree is only this high (gesturing) and it is not a dense tree. He could not have sat under the raspberry tree to drink tea.
    You must clearly understand what you are writing, otherwise, you will be used by the enemy. This is serving the enemy, not serving friends.
    A Soviet journalist once wrote: After France implemented the Marshall Plan, the situation was so bad that he had never seen meat in the soup. But the French never eat soup with meat. The French are indeed very poor, but the matter is not in the soup... And this was used by the enemies of the Soviet Union. They said: "Look at what you write about us!"
    We must remember that the enemy is not a fool. They read everything we write and try to use everything to their advantage. Therefore, we should be very careful when writing about things we do not understand.
    Think about it, if I were to write something about China now, every Chinese person would laugh at me. Or, because of respect for my past achievements and because of my gray hair, maybe they would say: "Poor Ehrenburg, how did he get to this point!"
    Even people who go to other provinces in their own country should observe, listen to the locals, and talk to them. Do not talk to journalists, but talk to ordinary people. Only after he understands something should he write an article. Then show it to the locals and ask them: "Is what I wrote crude?"
    I have seen the preface to the Russian translation of Bai Juyi. The preface said that Bai Juyi read his poems to ordinary old women and asked her: "Do you understand?"
    Therefore, Soviet journalists who write about Chinese affairs, or Chinese journalists who write about Soviet affairs, should also give what they have written to the locals and ask them if there are any fabrications.
    These are some simple answers to the questions you have raised.
    Are there any other questions?

Question: How does Mr. Ehrenburg describe soldiers and their psychology?

Answer:
    I have described our soldiers, soldiers, and officers because I have been with them. I did not run to them with a notebook and often talked with them all night long. They told me everything they felt and thought.
    Generally speaking, it is difficult to understand what war is from a bystander's point of view.
    In war, everyone will feel fear, and courage is that he can overcome fear. A person who has not experienced what fear is and what overcoming fear is cannot understand this principle.
    I will use a less serious example to illustrate this problem. Two years ago, a young writer came to me. At that time, I had a terrible headache and I was looking for a medicine. I took a pill and started talking to him. After a few minutes, he asked me: Can I ask you some questions? I said: "Please!" He asked: When you have a headache, does it hurt very much? It turned out that he had never suffered from a headache in his life.—His head had never hurt in his life—this is very good. But please think about it. In a head that has never hurt, a confused idea of describing a headache suddenly arises. He will write something ridiculous, and everyone will laugh, because most people's heads have hurt. Everyone will laugh when they read it.
    A journalist or writer comes to the regimental headquarters to understand the feelings of the soldiers. He says: Who is the bravest hero here? Others tell him: Ivanov, he got a prisoner yesterday. He says:
    "Please bring Ivanov here." Ivanov came, and then he took out his small notebook, sat down, and said: Tell me about the situation there. How did you get it? Were you afraid?
    Ivanov told him everything that had already been published in the division newspaper. He thought this was a certain and official news. To understand what Ivanov experienced, you need to put yourself in his situation to some extent. In this way, if you talk to him for a night, you can imagine a scene from his trivial words and understand what he encountered. If Ivanov himself can accurately understand what he encountered, then he himself will become a writer. Then why go to interview him? In order to see into Ivanov's heart, you need to eat a pound of salt with him, as the Soviet proverb says. Therefore, sometimes the soldiers feel that the war described in newspapers or books is not a war but a "parade."

Question: Can literary language be used in newspapers?

Answer:
    This question has two aspects. One aspect is the characteristics of China. I am not prepared to touch on this point, because I do not understand Chinese, and I do not like the kind of person who says things he does not know.
    Now I will answer the other aspect of the question, which is general and not Chinese. I think adopting literary language in newspapers can improve the newspaper and will not lower it.
    For example, to describe a very good and advanced rural person, you need to write about him artistically to make him a living person. That is to say, you should not be limited to numbers and only say that he cultivates a few acres of land. You should describe his entire inner world; otherwise, he will not be a living person, but will be a stereotype or number.
    Sometimes when you only understand one characteristic of a person, you will believe that he is a living person.
    Sometimes in novels, you need to describe nature and local customs.
    In this park, there is a place where the soil is collected from various provinces. Its colors are different. To describe the color of the soil in a few words, you need to use literary methods. Therefore, you cannot separate literature from the newspaper.
    It is very interesting that in difficult times, during the war, all the editors thought of writers and poets. Sometimes the editors did not like literature very much. There are such dry editors who even forgot that there are writers in the world in peacetime. When the environment is slightly more difficult, they remember it. Why? Because writers can touch the hearts of readers.
    I only hope that your meeting yesterday and today will merge together, that is, journalists will become writers and writers will become journalists.

### 在中国记者座谈会上的谈话

    在中国记者座谈会上的谈话
    伊里亚·爱伦堡丘琴  沈颖等译
    编者按：一九五一年九月二十日中国新闻出版印刷工会筹备委员会在北京中山公园文化俱乐部举行了欢迎爱伦堡的座谈会，爱伦堡热情地报告了他的写作经验，并回答了中国记者所提出的一些问题，下面就是座谈会记录的主要部分。
    根据多次座谈的经验，我感到异常遗憾的是，我不会讲中国话。我并不想说翻译同志的什么坏话，我自己就常常当翻译，所以我知道翻译工作是多么的困难。特别是，我体会到，我所讲的话很难翻译的原因是：我常常在谈话中不是表达爱，就是表达憎。可是，大概世上从来还没有人借助于翻译来表达爱情，这样的情侣是没有的。同时，我想，也没有人借助于翻译来责骂人的——因此翻译我的话是非常困难的事。我是一个作家，但我也从事记者工作。我以为，这样严格的区分是不可能的。不错，有些国家的作家是有点看不起记者，轻视记者的。这是不对的，因为能够做一个好的记者，总比做一个坏的作家强得多。然而，能够做一个优秀的作家，却未必能作一个较好的记者……一般地说，作家参加报馆工作，会使报纸生动起来。我们国内有一个文学报，这个报纸，主要的是作家执笔。就其本质来看，这个报纸是政治性的，但，它却比别的报纸生动得多。人们也比较爱读她。这个报纸，很少用公文式的语言写文章。
    那么，做一个记者对作家有什么好处呢？
    一个记者，如果他是一个好的记者对于生活会看得非常清楚。所以，凡是一个好的记者如果他对所观察的事物用心构思，他是能够写小说的。
    我不是说，每个小说家都能成为记者，都能写文章。
    另一方面，从事记者工作对于作家有什么害处呢？只有一点：假使他用不好的报纸用语开始写作。
    我不晓得中国新闻工作的特点，以及大家所急需解决的那些问题。我将这样地谈，仿佛坐在我身前的是我的本国人——苏联记者们，而他们在要求我来交换经验。
    读者当然是有头脑的，而我们则是努力于使它更好地工作。可是，读者也同样地有一颗心。而记者却常常忘掉了这一点，他们注意的仅是人们的理智，而没有注意到人们的情感。而一个记者应该不仅注意读者的理智，同时，也要注意到读者的情感。
    当一个年青人给他所欢喜的，他所爱恋着的少女写信时，他就会感觉到她出现在自己的面前，并且尽量寻找那些足以打动她底心的那些话语和形象。
    当一个坏的记者写文章的时候——我说的是坏记者——他是不是看到他所要感动的读者如在面前呢？
    他所看到的常常并不是读者，而是主笔，于是他尽量博取欢心的就不是读者，而是主笔。他努力于研究主笔的爱好。他懂得主笔喜好什么，不喜好什么。于是，他常常忘记了，他的写作并不是为了主笔，而是为了所要感动的读者。
    关于文体和用语也是这样。
    每个人都有他自己的声调。当一个人坐在隔壁的房间里，我们会知道他是谁，我们说，这是我们的某一位朋友或是相识的人在讲话。
    正因为我们是共产主义者，我们才不抹杀个性，相反地，却努力于发挥个性。
    不好的记者并不努力于使用自己的话语来讲话，而是用某种他认为是彬彬有礼的——公式的，庸俗的，刻板的语言来讲话。
    我曾经问过自己，我在战时所写的文章，为什么会受到我国士兵的欢迎？那就是因为我是用自己的话语来讲的。
    他们在文章后面，可以见到人与人在讲话——这是最重要的。
    现在，关于语言，我再讲几句话。不过这是以俄国的经验，或者以西欧的经验为基础的。在中国，可能是完全另一种条件，别人的苦处，在你们也许是觉得可笑的。
    欧洲报纸最糟糕的一点，就是它所用的语言，比较人民的语言，要贫乏得多。
    你们之中，如果有人研究俄文，并且能读俄文报纸，最好不要以为自己就懂得俄文。
    英国人，我说的是英帝国主义者，在战争的前夜，打算创造一种贫乏的“基本英语”，供他们想使之殖民地化的外国人使用。
    用这种基本语言来写“准许何人在城内通行，不准何人通行”一类的命令，是可以的，但是，用来写“哈姆雷特”是不行的。总之，它不可能把人类的思想表达出来。
    捷克的，俄国的，法国的，波兰的不好的记者，他们是用“基本俄语”，“基本法语”，“基本捷克语”来写的。他们的语汇里的用字是很不够的。
    有时候，在这方面，主笔也会犯错误。
    有些主笔，习惯于一定的辞句，认为永远应该用这些辞句，如果遇到新的辞句时，他们就把它抹去，换上那些规定好的辞句。
    我记得，诗人西蒙诺夫曾经写过一首“等着我吧”的诗，在军队里极为流行，并且译成了中文。这是一个士兵写给他所爱的女子的一封信，在信里面士兵请她等待着他。
    在那时候，这首诗是很需要的。这首诗，虽然不太富于诗的意味，但是在这里面，有着一种诗的形象。
    在这首诗里面，有这样短的一行：“等着我吧！当黄雨带来愁闷的时候。”
    我偶然到了主笔的办公室里，这时候主笔正要想抹去“黄雨”这两个字。
    主笔说道：从来没有用“黄雨”这两个字的，都是用“闷雨”，“久雨”，为什么用“黄雨”呢？
    我相信，我们中的每一个人都看见过，在下大雨而且土壤又是黏土的时候，那末，雨水就像是黄色的了。
    我国有许多黄色的土地，而且报馆主笔大概也看见过黄色的雨，他是在生活中看到的，而不是在报纸上看到的。所以如果他拿起笔来就写，我们就要费很大的力量去制止他的手。
    坏的记者总是滥用同样的一些方法的。
    每一种方法首次都能够引起人的感想，而以后读者习惯了，就不再理会它了。
    头一次说的时候，比方说“华尔街底仆从”，它是予人一种印象的。但是，读者千百遍地读过之后，就不会去注意它了。
    有时，当你读到不好的记者底文章时，就会有这样一种印象，他毫无理由地强迫排字工人去工作。因为简直用不着排字，只要把许多整个的句子从别的地方移过来就可以。
    有一位捷克名作家叫卡尔·卡贝克。他有一个可笑的故事，我简单地把它谈谈。
    他说，有一个学者，他找到了用引起观念来辨识思想的一种方法。
    这个方法是这样的，即如果对某一个人说出一个字，那末，在他的思维中就产生了另一个相近的字。
    因此一个人就应当不加思索地说话。教授说了一个字，被问的那个人应当立刻说出另一个字来。
    他曾和一个人试验过，这个人是被疑为是杀人凶手的。他说：“道路”。凶手回答说：“田地”。他说：“树林”。凶手就说“峡谷”。他说：“锄头”。凶手就说：“坑”。于是他就找到了被凶手埋在坑中的那一个死人。
    大家看到了，他得到很大的成功，就建议作公开表演来试验。出席了很多的人。于是他就问：“谁愿意来作试验？”他说：“道路”。试验的人就回答说：“宽阔的进步底道路”。他说：“密云”。那一个人就回答：“反动底阴暗的密云”。他说：“车轮”。那一个人就回答：“历史底车轮”。
    他对于一切的问话都用报纸上现成的句子来回答，任何自己的思维他都不曾说出来。于是教授就说了：“我承认我失败了。一百次的试验中头一次的失败。但是，请告诉我，您姓什么？”他说：“您怎能不知道啊？我是一个名记者。”
    因此我想，我们大家，不问我们生在那一个国家里，都应该和所谓“磨光了的五哥比”作斗争。磨光了的五哥比，是已经陈旧了的一种形象，是已经使旧了的货币。……………
    现在我要说一说关于简短，简练，简洁的必要。报纸不是巨部的长篇小说。人们要很快地阅读报纸，要一面行动着一面读。
    要善于简短地去写作。这比长篇大论地去写作要困难的多。
    有一些人不明白这个。
    比方说，主笔给我打电话，并且说：——请写一篇文章吧。——我说：不行。我没有时间。但是他就说：请写一篇极短的……他不了解，写短篇文章要比写长篇文章费时间。
    我想你们大家应当有这种技巧，因为你们中国的古诗是具有一种简练的优点的。中国诗是非常简练的。
    我想用我生平一件可笑的回忆来解说这一点。这是在很早以前，是在我青年时候。我有一个朋友，他是有钱的人，而我是一个没有钱的人。我时常可以从他那里拿到钱。
    但是有钱的人并不和奶牛一样，越向他多挤，就越难挤出。挤牛奶要挤到底，否则它就少给，可是，如果同样地去挤有钱的人，那他就越给越少了。
    我到了另一个城市，我身边一文钱也没有了，所以想向这一个朋友借一些钱，想要他给我汇些钱来。
    我决定给他打电报。我想要写得能打动他那冷却的心肠才好。但是，我了解了，如果我写一篇极长的电报，那末，我等不到钱寄到我就要饿死了……因为每一个字都要付钱的。在我一生，从来没有写过任何一篇作品像写这个电报稿子花了这么久的时间。我必须解决一个困难的问题：以最少的字数表达出最大数量的感情——这就是记者和作家的任务。
    可惜我们那里对于多余的字，是给记者付稿费的。字数越多，稿费也越多，如果规定他们要对每个多余的字都付钱的话，那么他们也许会写得好些的。
    这就是根据我自己的经验要和你们讨论的，关于我们记者职业的一点简短意见。
    现在我请你们向我提出问题，如能答复的，我来答复你们。问题：爱伦堡先生，您怎样准备访问？您怎样收集资料？您怎样分析对象并且怎样来判断陌生的情况？回答：
    问题很多，这也许要用好几个小时来谈的，我尽量用几句话来很简短地作答复。我来谈谈琐碎的小事，也许这些小事可以帮助更具体地做出总结。
    笨拙的摄影记者，当他给人照像的时候，他长时间地给他矫正姿势，他说：头向左转一点，做出有精神的姿势来！而后他才给他摄影。这样一来被摄影的人已不像他本人了，而像其他另一个人了。
    笨拙的记者和人谈话的时候，手里拿着笔记簿在记录，当谈话的人看到有人在记录他的语词时，他就不再说出他心里所想的东西。记者从他口中不会听到一点生动的东西的，他只说那些应当说的话了。
    因此我愿向年轻的记者建议，千万不要当着谈话的人把所听到的话记录下来，而要在事后记录所听到的一切。
    同志们问到应当如何收集资料。
    图书馆的资料，不应在写文章的时候才搜集，而应很早以前就去搜集。记者可以在图书馆里摘记，并可把他感觉有兴趣的东西记在自己的笔记本上，这是他的事情。
    他有由他自己支配的晚间，他可以去阅读的。这也许经过两年后才用得着，但是他还是去阅读好了。
    当需要写文章的时候，才往图书馆里跑，那是不行的，因为已没有时间。
    优秀的记者可以在报纸出版前的晚间写好文章。这时只有一本笔记簿是他的资料，是他的图书馆。
    同志们问，到陌生的国家怎么办？
    法国人讲：有一个英国人渡过拉曼斯海峡到了卡列城，看到一个棕发的法国女人，他就写了：所有的法国女人都是棕发的。
    有一个法国作家，在前一世纪到了俄国，而后他写道，他在茂密的红莓树下喝过茶。红莓树是一种小果树，法国没有，只在俄国才有。这树不过这样高（做手势）而且也不是茂密的树，他不可能坐在红莓树下喝茶的。
    你必须清楚地了解你所写的东西，否则就会被敌人利用。这是为敌人服务，而不是为朋友服务。
    有一个苏联的记者曾写道：法国实行马歇尔计划之后，其情形之糟，以致他在汤里没有看到过肉。而法国人根本就不吃带肉的汤。法国人确实很困苦，但事情并不在汤上………而这点就被苏联的敌人利用去了，他们说：“你们看，把我们写成什么样子了！”
    我们必须记住，敌人也不是糊涂虫，他们在阅读我们所写的一切，并且竭力想利用于他们自己有利的一切，因此对于不了解的东西，应当非常小心地去写。
    你们想想，如果我现在要是写一点关于中国的某些事情，每一个中国人都会要笑我的。或者由于尊敬我过去的功绩，并由于我的鬓发斑白，也许说：“可怜的爱伦堡，怎么被弄到这种地步了！”
    甚至于到自己本国的其他省份去的人，也应当观察，听取当地人的话，并和他们接谈。不要和记者谈话，而要和普通人谈话，只有当他了解了一些东西之后，才要去写文章。而后再给当地的人看并问他们：“我所写的是不是粗率？”
    我看过白居易俄文译本序言。序言中说白居易把自己所作的诗读给普通的老婆婆听，并问她：“你懂了没懂？”
    所以写中国事情的苏联记者，或是写苏联事情的中国记者，也应该把他所写的东西交给当地的人看并问他们有没有胡诌的地方。
    这就是我对于你们所提出来的问题的一些简陋的回答。
    还有什么问题吗？问题：爱伦堡先生怎样描述战士和他们的心理呢？回答：
    我描写过我们的军人、士兵和军官，因为我曾和他们在一起，并不是带着笔记本跑到他们那里去的，并且经常彻夜地和他们畅谈，他们就把自己所感觉的和所想的事情全都告诉了我。
    一般地讲，站在旁观者的立场很难了解什么是战争。
    在战争中，每个人都会感到恐惧，而勇敢就是他自己能战胜恐惧。一个没有经过什么是恐惧和什么是战胜恐惧的人，他就不能懂得这个道理。
    我拿一个不太严重的例子来说明这个问题。两年以前，有一个年青的作家来找我。那时我的头痛的很厉害，我正在找一种药。我吃了一片药就开始和他谈话。过了几分钟他问我：可以给您提出些问题吗？我说“请吧！”他问：“当头痛的时候，疼的很厉害吗？”原来他这一辈子也没患过头痛。——他这一辈子脑袋从来没疼过——这是很好的。可是请您想一想，在一个从来也没疼过的脑袋里，忽然发生了描写头疼的糊涂思想。他会写出很不像话的东西，大家都会嘲笑，因为大多数的人的脑袋都疼过。大家在读的时候，就会大笑起来。
    记者或作家来到团的指挥所，为了了解战士的感觉。他说：你们这里谁是最勇敢的英雄？别人告诉他说：依万诺夫，他昨天弄到了一个俘虏。他说：
    “请把伊万诺夫找来。”伊万诺夫来了，此后，他拿出小笔记本，坐下了，并说：你把那里的情形讲给我听吧，你怎么搞来的，害怕不？
    伊万诺夫把在师的报纸上已登载过的东西都告诉他了，他认为这已是肯定的和正式的消息了。想要了解伊万诺夫体验了一些什么，就需要自己多多少少地设身处境一下，这样，假如和他谈上一夜，从他琐碎的话里就可以想像出一种景象，并可以了解他遇到了些什么事情。假如伊万诺夫自己能准确地了解他遇到的事情，那末他自己就成为作家了，那还去访问作什么呢。为了洞察伊万诺夫的内心，就要像苏联俗语所说的那样：和他在一起吃一普特咸盐。所以有时战士们感觉在报纸上或书本里所描写的战争不是战争而是“阅兵”。问题：在报纸上可以使用文学的语言吗？回答：
    这个问题有两方面。一方面是中国的特点，我不准备涉及这一点。因为我不懂中文，并且我很不喜欢那种说他自己所不知道的事情的人。
    现在我回答问题的另一方面，就是一般的而不是中国的。我觉得在报纸上采用文学的语言可以提高报纸，并不会把它降低。
    例如，描写一个很好的先进的乡下人，那就需要很艺术地来写他，使他成为一个活人。也就是说不应该仅限于数字，仅仅说他耕种几亩地。应该描写他的整个内心世界，否则他就不是活人了，而会是一个刻板或数字。
    有时当您仅仅了解到人的一个特点的时候，您会相信，这是一个活人。
    有时在小说里需要描写大自然，需要描写风土。
    在这个公园里，有一个地方那里的土是从各省搜集来的。它的颜色不一。为了用几句话描写土的颜色，需要用文学方法。因此不能把文学与报纸分开。
    很有兴趣的是，在很困难的时候，在战争的时候，所有的编辑都想起了作家和诗人。有时编辑并不太喜欢文学。有这种枯燥的编辑，在和平的时候，他们甚至忘掉了在世界上还有作家这种人。当环境稍微困难一点的时候，他们就想起来了。因为什么呢？因为作家能够打动读者的心。
    我只愿您们昨天和今天的会议融合在一起，就是记者成为作家，而作家成为记者。
