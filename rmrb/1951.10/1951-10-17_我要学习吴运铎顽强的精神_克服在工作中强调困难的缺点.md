Reader's Letter

    I want to learn from Wu Yunduo's tenacious spirit and overcome the shortcoming of emphasizing difficulties in my work.
    To the Editor:
    Recently, I read several extremely vivid articles about model Party members published in the "Party Life" column and on the second page of the People's Daily, and I was deeply moved. The article "How Steel Was Tempered" recounts the heroic deeds of China's Paul Korchagin—the meritorious worker of the ordnance industry, Wu Yunduo. In the past dozen years of ordnance production, he was injured more than a hundred times, his hands and feet were disabled, and the lens of his left eye was also damaged, but he still wholeheartedly and tenaciously worked for the Party. Wu Yunduo, with his own exemplary deeds, teaches us that under any difficult conditions, we should unconditionally and tenaciously fight to the end for the interests of the Party.
    I am a journalist and a member of the Communist Youth League. In my mind, a kind of non-proletarian ideological consciousness often appears. For example, I often emphasize objective difficulties in my work, which is very wrong.
    I am determined to demand myself with Wu Yunduo's selfless and tenacious fighting spirit for the Party and the motherland, so as to overcome my shortcomings in work and study, and strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.

### 我要学习吴运铎顽强的精神  克服在工作中强调困难的缺点

    我要学习吴运铎顽强的精神  克服在工作中强调困难的缺点编辑同志：
    最近我读了人民日报“党的生活”栏和第二版发表的几篇极其生动的介绍模范党员的文章，非常感动。 “钢铁是这样炼成的”一文是记述中国的保尔·柯察金——兵工功臣吴运铎的英雄事迹。他在过去十几年的兵工生产中，曾负伤一百余处，手足都残废了，左眼的水晶体也坏了，但仍全心全意地顽强地为党工作。吴运铎以他自己的模范事迹教导我们：在任何困难的条件下，应当无条件地顽强地为党的利益奋斗到底。
    我是一个新闻工作者，又是一个青年团员。在我的头脑中，时常出现一种非无产阶级的思想意识。如我在工作中往往强调客观困难，这是很不应该的。
    我决心以吴运铎的为党、为祖国的大公无私的顽强的奋斗精神来要求我自己，以求在工作中、学习中克服自己的缺点，争取做一个光荣的共产党员。
