    Loving Our Motherland Means Selling Cotton to the State!
    Qu Yaoli, Agricultural Labor Model of Shanxi Province
    This is my first time coming to Beijing and Tianjin, my first time seeing Chairman Mao, my first time shaking hands with workers, and also my first time visiting such a large exhibition as the North China Regional Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition. I have learned many things and have many thoughts. Now I will only talk about some of the main ones.

    I am a cotton grower, so of course I am most concerned about growing cotton. After visiting the exhibition this time, I truly realized that to love the country, one must sell cotton to the state. In the past, when I grew cotton at home, I only thought about picking more cotton and selling it for more money; at most, cotton could only be used to weave coarse and fine cloth and to make cotton clothes and quilts. I never thought that if I didn't sell cotton to the state, factories couldn't start production. If factories don't start production, the country's industrial production will suffer losses. If this continues, the cotton grown by farmers will also be useless, and the lives of both workers and peasants cannot be improved; I never even thought that cotton, in addition to weaving cloth and carpets, also has other uses in industry. Visiting the Cotton Pavilion this time broadened my horizons. Although when purchasing and storing cotton, I mobilized all the farmers in the village to sell a portion of their cotton to the state, I didn't really understand these principles.

    I also realized that cotton has so many uses because it is made by the hands of the worker elder brothers operating machines. In Tianjin, I visited the state-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. I thought: the skills of the worker elder brothers are really great, so many such large machines, it almost dazzled my eyes. But the worker comrades manage it so well. According to worker comrades, they produce six to seven thousand bolts of cloth every day. I thought of when my family weaves cloth, they weave day and night non-stop, and they can't even weave a small bolt of cloth in two days. Visiting the Agricultural Production Materials Pavilion, I also saw tractors, weeding machines, sowing machines created by workers.... I thought that if we could use machines to farm, cotton production would definitely increase even more. This also made me realize that increasing cotton production is inseparable from the leadership of the working class. I also saw that the Soviet Union can harvest 1,800 jin of cotton per mu. I thought my cotton only harvested over 800 jin, not even half of the Soviet Union's. When I go back this time, I must tell all the cotton farmers in the village: we must learn from the creative spirit of the working class, we must learn from the cotton planting experience of the Soviet elder brothers, and strive to increase cotton production.

    When I visited the state-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, as soon as I got off the bus, the worker comrades lifted me up and carried me all the way into the factory building, which really made me feel indescribably happy. After industrial labor models Wang Deshan and Sun Guilan led us to visit the factory, they also held a discussion meeting. At the meeting, Wang Deshan, on behalf of the workers, said: I hope that peasant brothers will grow a large amount of S-2 and S-4 cotton; I hope that peasant brothers will respond to the government's call to sell and store all the cotton to the state; I hope that peasant brothers will not mix good cotton with bad cotton, and remove the impurities from the cotton. I also said on behalf of the farmers: Farmers have an old conservative idea, that they always want to sell the cotton when they need money, and not sell it when they don't need money. This time I understood that the state needs cotton to be used on time. I will tell this to all the farmers, educate everyone to overcome conservative and selfish ideas, and sell all the cotton to the state on time. I also guarantee that after returning to the village, I will do a good job of publicity and mobilization, so that the farmers in my village will sell all the new cotton to the state within fifty days.

    热爱我们的祖国要把棉花卖给国家！
    山西省农业劳动模范  曲耀离
    我这是第一次来到北京、天津，第一次看见了毛主席，第一次和工人握了手，也是第一次参观了像华北区城乡物资交流展览会这样大的展览会。我学习到了许多东西，也有许多感想，现在只来谈一些主要的。
    我是一个种棉花的人，当然最关心种棉花。这回我参观了展览会后，才真正认识到要爱国，就要把棉花卖给国家的道理。从前我在家种棉花，只想到棉花摘得多，卖得钱多；棉花顶多也不过是能织粗细布和装棉衣、棉被；没想到不把棉花卖给国家，工厂就不能开工，工厂不开工，国家工业生产就要受到损失，这样下去，农民种的棉花也将无用，工农的生活都不能改善；更没想到棉花除织布织毯外，在工业上也还有其他的用处。这回参观了棉花馆，把我的眼光放远了，虽然在购棉储棉时，我动员全村农民把棉花卖给了国家一部分，可是并没认识到这些道理。
    我又认识到棉花所以有那么多用处，都是靠工人老大哥的双手开机器造成的。在天津，我参观了国营棉纺第二厂。我心想：工人老大哥的本事实在大，那么多那样大的机器，简直把我的眼睛都看花了。可是工人老大哥管理得那么好。听工人同志说，他们每天就要出六七千匹布。我想起我家人织布时，白天黑夜不停地织，两天也织不到一小匹布。参观农业生产资料馆，我又看到工人创造的拖拉机、锄草机、播种机……，我想我们能用机器来种地，棉花的产量一定还能提得更高。这又使我认识到：棉花产量要提高，也离不开工人阶级的领导。我又看到苏联的棉花一亩能摘一千八百斤，我想我的棉花才摘到八百多斤，连苏联的一半也还没达到。这次回去，我一定要告给全村棉农：要学习工人阶级的创造精神，要学习苏联老大哥的植棉经验，努力提高棉花产量。
    我到国营棉纺第二厂参观时，刚一下汽车，工人同志就把我抬起来，一直抬到工厂房子里，真使我有一种说不出的高兴。工业劳动模范王德山和孙桂兰领我们参观了工厂后，又召开了座谈会。在会上，王德山代表工人说：希望农民弟兄大量种斯字二号和斯字四号棉花；希望农民弟兄响应政府号召把棉花全部售储给国家；希望农民弟兄不要把好花和坏花混在一起，要把棉花的杂质除干净。我也代表农民说：农民有个老保守想法，摘下棉花总想着用钱就卖，不用钱就不卖。这回我才明白了国家用棉花是要按时用。我要把这一点告给全体农民，教育大家克服保守自私思想，按时把棉花全部卖给国家。我还保证，回村后好好作宣传动员工作，要我村农民把新棉花在五十天里全部卖给国家。
