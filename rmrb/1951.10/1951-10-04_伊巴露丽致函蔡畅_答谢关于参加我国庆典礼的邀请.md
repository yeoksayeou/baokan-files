Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Cai Chang, President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, received a telegram from Dolores Ibárruri, Vice-President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, thanking her for the invitation to attend the National Day celebrations in China. The telegram reads as follows:

To Madam Cai Chang, President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Beijing.

Dear friend,

I deeply appreciate your warm invitation to attend the grand celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China. Pressing tasks prevent me from celebrating this great and historic victory of the Chinese people with you. I ask you to convey my warmest greetings and the greetings of the Spanish people to the heroic Chinese women, to your fighting, self-sacrificing people, to the glorious Chinese Communist Party and to the great Stalinist leader Mao Zedong. The Spanish people love the Chinese people and admire their years of struggle, a struggle that has won a great victory celebrated today by advanced and progressive humanity. This struggle inspires the Spanish people in their struggle against the Franco fascist tyranny, to wage a resolute and unyielding resistance.

Long live the friendship between the Spanish and Chinese people!

Long live the heroic Chinese women!

Long live Mao Zedong, the glorious leader of the People's Republic of China!

Dolores Ibárruri
