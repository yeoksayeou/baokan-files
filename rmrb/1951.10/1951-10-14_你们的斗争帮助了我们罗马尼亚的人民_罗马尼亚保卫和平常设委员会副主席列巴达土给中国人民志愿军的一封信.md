Your struggle helps us Romanians
A Letter from Constantin Levaditi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace in Romania, to the Chinese People's Volunteers

The American imperialists and their puppet Syngman Rhee’s army are invading the young democratic nation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The remaining imperialist countries are following behind them, continuing to send troops to Korea. They have committed heinous crimes against the Korean people, destroying villages and towns, and slaughtering children, women, and the elderly.

You, the outstanding sons of the Chinese people, are also familiar with the implications of imperialist oppression. Therefore, you fully understand that the Korean people are not only defending themselves, but are defending peace and freedom for all the people of the world against the massacres of American imperialism.

The aggression of American imperialism is also a direct threat to the new China. In this new China, the possibility of imperialists exploiting the people no longer exists. Your parents, sisters, and brothers are working hard to eliminate the dark traditions left behind by imperialism, to provide the people with what they need, and to rebuild your villages and towns. I have personally witnessed the great efforts of this reconstruction work. But in order for them to complete this work, they need peace, which is the same peace that you are defending in Korea.

I have seen how your leaders and people are proud of you, and how much they love you!

I have had the opportunity to personally see the close unity that connects the soldiers at the front with those left behind at home. In Lucun Village, I met a farmer named Wang Deming, whose two sons are fighting in Korea. He told us, "We work at home to supply the front and the people, and to defend peace. The people in my village respect me very much, and they helped me build this new house, the house that my family and I now live in."

In this village, the number of students enrolled in schools is three times what it was before liberation. The harvest of farmers in the fields has also increased compared to before. They are working hard to achieve even greater harvests. But in order for more children to go to school, for farmers to get more harvest from the land they have received in the land reform, and for workers to work on larger construction foundations and increase more products, we need peace, and you, on the front lines in Korea, are defending peace.

We also understand that you have used this struggle to help the people of Romania to carry out peaceful construction to strengthen our country. That is why the hopes of our people always follow you in this great battle, because you are fighting for the cause of peace.

In this struggle, you have proven the superiority of the peace and democracy camp over the anti-democratic war camp.

You have proven to the world that American imperialists are not invincible, they can be defeated. The result of your and the Korean people's severe blow to American imperialism has lowered the prestige of American imperialists not only in the eyes of the people of the world, but also in the eyes of their own people. In this way, you have proven that victory always belongs to the forces that defend justice, democracy, and peace.

You, the beloved sons of the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Comrade Mao Zedong, are writing a new and most glorious page in the history of the Chinese people. With the support of the entire peace and democracy camp, and together with the heroic Korean people, you will stop the evil plans of American imperialism in Korea.

We believe that you will succeed. The Chinese people, who have just freed themselves from the oppression of imperialism, are looking forward to their own bright future under construction with confidence. We firmly believe in your future success, because you enjoy the friendship of peace-loving people from all countries, especially the friendship and support of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, and its great leader, the banner of the struggle for peace and happiness, the great Stalin.

Constantin Levaditi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace in Romania

    你们的斗争帮助了我们罗马尼亚的人民
    罗马尼亚保卫和平常设委员会副主席列巴达土给中国人民志愿军的一封信
    美帝国主义者及其傀儡李承晚的军队侵略着民主的年轻国家——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。其余的帝国主义国家跟在他们的后面，也继续派军队到朝鲜去。他们对朝鲜人民犯了弥天大罪，他们毁灭着村镇，屠杀着儿童、妇女和老人。
    你们，中国人民的优秀儿子，也很熟悉帝国主义压迫的含意。因此，你们完全了解，朝鲜人民不仅是为自己，而是为全世界人民保卫着和平与自由以反对美国帝国主义的屠杀。
    美国帝国主义的侵略也是对新中国的直接威胁。在这个新中国里，帝国主义者剥削人民的可能已完全不存在了。你们的父母、姐妹和兄弟都在为铲除帝国主义遗留下来的黑暗传统，为供给人民以所需，为重建你们的乡村和市镇而努力工作。我也曾亲眼看到这一重建工作的巨大努力。但他们要完成这一工作，就需要和平，也就是需要你们在朝鲜所保卫的那同一的和平。
    我曾经看到你们的领袖和人民怎样为你们而骄傲，以及他们怎样地爱你们！
    我曾经有机会亲眼看到了紧密的团结，它把前方的战士和后方留在家里的人连结起来。我在鹿圈村遇到一位农民王德明，他的两个儿子都在朝鲜作战。他告诉我们说：“我们在家里工作是为了供应前方和人民，为了保卫和平。我村里的人对我很尊重，他们帮助我盖了这座新屋子，也就是我和我的家现在住的这座房子。”
    在这个村里，入学的人数已相当于解放前的三倍。农民在田里的收获量也比以前增加。他们正在努力争取更多的收获量。但是为了使更多的孩子入学，使农民能从土地改革中所分得的土地上获得更多的收获，使工人能在更大的建筑地基上工作，增加更多的产品，那就需要和平，而你们，在朝鲜前线，正是在保卫着和平。
    我们也很了解，你们已用这一斗争帮助了我们罗马尼亚的人民，使其能进行和平建设以加强我们的国家。这就是为什么在这一伟大战斗中，我国人民的希望总是跟随着你们，因为你们是在为和平事业而斗争。
    在这一斗争中，你们已证实了和平民主阵营的优越于反民主的战争阵营。
    你们已向全世界证明，美帝国主义者不是不能被战胜的，它是可以打败的。你们和朝鲜人民给美帝国主义以严厉打击的结果，不仅在全世界人民面前，而且也在其本国人面前，降低了美帝国主义者的威信。这样，你们已证明了胜利总是属于保卫正义、民主与和平力量方面的。
    你们，伟大中国人民的可敬爱的儿女们，你们在伟大的毛泽东同志的领导下，正在写出中国人民历史上新的最光荣的一页。在整个和平民主阵营的支援下，和英勇的朝鲜人民在一道，你们将会阻止住美帝国主义在朝鲜实行的罪恶计划。
    我们相信你们必将成功。刚在昨天摆脱了帝国主义压迫的中国人民，正满怀着信心展望自己建设中的灿烂的未来。我们坚信你们未来的成功，因为你们享有着爱好和平的各国人民的友谊，特别是你们享有着伟大社会主义国家苏联及其伟大领袖、争取和平与幸福斗争的旗手，伟大的斯大林对于你们的友谊和支持。
    罗马尼亚保卫和平常设委员会副主席康斯坦丁·列巴达土
