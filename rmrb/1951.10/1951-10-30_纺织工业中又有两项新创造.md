Two New Creations in the Textile Industry
The Ji Qiaozhen Group of Nantong Dasheng Textile Factory creates a new method of increasing cotton cloth production; Guo Yueying and Cai Xiaozhen of Jiading Jiafeng Yarn Factory create a hand-cranked roving cleaner, enriching the content of the Hao Jianxiu work method.

Following the emergence of the Hao Jianxiu fine yarn work method, two new creations have recently appeared in the cotton textile industry: one is the new work method of the Ji Qiaozhen Group in the cloth workshop of Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory in northern Jiangsu; the other is the successful creation of a hand-cranked roving cleaner by Guo Yueying and Cai Xiaozhen of Jiading Jiafeng Yarn Factory in southern Jiangsu. The former reduces the number of substandard cloths, while the latter shortens the time for cleaning work in spinning, enriching the content of the Hao Jianxiu work method.

The Ji Qiaozhen Group is a model group in the Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory. Since the launch of the patriotic labor emulation campaign, the substandard cloth rate of the Ji Qiaozhen Group has consistently been the lowest in the entire cloth factory. Taking the average substandard cloth rate from March to May this year as an example, the entire cloth workshop was 8.81 percent, while the group was only 1.45 percent, with an output reaching 50 yards. The reason why their group was able to achieve this result is because they created a rational working method in their work. The characteristic of this working method is: every action of every person is focused on how to reduce substandard cloths, how to reduce downtime, and increase output. For example, they first inspect the machines when they start work, checking whether the pressure axle hammer is appropriate and whether the machine parts are damaged or loose, which makes it possible to prevent accidents; the joints are made in front of the machine, the shuttle changing action is quick, and the full shuttle is immediately inserted when the weft yarn is finished, changing it in three seconds; strive to do a good job in cleaning and inspection, clean up the flower clothing knots, reduce yarn breakage, and save downtime; work together and help each other, and look at the neighbor's machine while inspecting; if there is a broken yarn and damaged cloth, the neighboring car also comes to help; when dismantling the cloth, if both cars have defective cloths, the shorter one is dismantled first, and then the longer one. In this way, the downtime is reduced, and more cloth is woven. If the Ji Qiaozhen Group's working method is learned by their entire workshop and reaches their current level, it can increase the national cotton cloth production by 13,600 pieces per year.

Guo Yueying and Cai Xiaozhen, female piecers at Jiading County Jiafeng Yarn Factory, created a hand-cranked roving cleaner, which increased the efficiency of cleaning work by twenty times. In the past, the flying flowers on the fine yarn car surface in their factory were all rolled with flower clothing sticks. Each day (ten hours), the bobbin feet were rolled twice, and the flowers on the car surface were rolled ten times, which took two people more than fifty minutes. This not only made the workers' hands ache and easily broke the yarn ends, but also made the car surface unclean. Since the hand-cranked roving cleaner was successfully tested, the car surface, leather roller hooks, leather roller springs, roving tube feet, and roller stools can be brushed very clean. Cleaning the coarse yarn wooden bobbin feet twice and cleaning the car surface flowers ten times a day only takes two minutes and thirty seconds in total, increasing the efficiency of cleaning work by twenty times, making the content of Hao Jianxiu's scientific fine yarn work method richer.

### 纺织工业中又有两项新创造

    纺织工业中又有两项新创造
    南通大生纺织厂季巧珍小组创造增加棉布产量新工作法；嘉定嘉丰纱厂
    郭月英、蔡小珍创造手摇巡回清洁器，丰富了郝建秀工作法的内容。
    继郝建秀细纱工作法出现之后，棉纺织工业中最近又出现了两项新创造：一个是苏北区南通大生纱厂布场季巧珍小组的新工作法；一个是苏南区嘉定县嘉丰纱厂郭月英、蔡小珍两人创制手摇巡回清洁器成功。前者降低次布出数，后者缩短了纺纱中做清洁工作的时间，充实了郝建秀工作法的内容。
    季巧珍小组，是南通大生纱厂的一个模范小组。自从开展爱国主义劳动竞赛以来，季巧珍小组的次布率一直是全布厂中最少的一个。以今年三月到五月的平均次布率为例，全布场为百分之八点八一，而该组却仅为百分之一点四五，出数且达到五十码。他们组所以能得到这个成绩，就是因为他们在工作中创造了一种合理的工作方法。这一工作方法的特点是：每一个人的每一个动作，都集中注意怎样来减少次布，怎样来减少关车时间，增加出品。例如：他们上工就先检查机器，检查压轴重锤是否恰当，机件有无损坏松动，这样就有可能防止事故的发生；接头在车子前面接，换梭动作敏捷，纡纱走完便立即投入满梭，三秒钟即换好；争取时间做好清洁、巡视工作，清理花衣大结，减少断头，节省关车时间；工作中团结互助，巡视时不单看自己的车子，同时替旁人看；发生断头拆坏布，邻车的也来帮助；拆布时如果两台车都有了坏布，则先拆短的，然后再拆长的。这样，减少了关车时间，也就多织了布。季巧珍小组的这个工作方法，如果为他们全车间所学会，并达到他们的现有水平，一年就可给国家增产棉布一万三千六百匹。
    嘉定县嘉丰纱厂接头女工郭月英、蔡小珍两人创造了手摇巡回清洁器，使清洁工作效率提高了二十倍。过去，她们厂里细纱车面上的飞花，都是用花衣棒卷的，每天（十小时）卷两次锭脚和十次车面上的花衣，两个人做要用五十多分钟。这不但使工友们手累得发酸，容易碰断纱头，而且车面也弄不清爽。自手摇巡回清洁器试验成功后，车面、皮辊轧钩、皮辊弹簧、粗纱筒脚、罗拉凳子等，都可以刷得非常干净。每天清两次粗纱木锭脚和清十次车面花衣，一共只要二分三十秒钟，提高了清洁工作效率二十倍，使郝建秀式的科学细纱工作法的内容更加丰富起来。
