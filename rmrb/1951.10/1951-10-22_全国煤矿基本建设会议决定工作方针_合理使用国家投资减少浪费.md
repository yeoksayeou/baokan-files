The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government convened the National Coal Mine Capital Construction Conference from September 26th to October 5th. The conference summarized the experiences and lessons learned from coal mine industry capital construction work over the past two years and decided on the guiding principles and tasks for capital construction in the coming years. The conference decided that the guiding principle for coal mine industry capital construction in 1952 and the next few years will be to focus on restoration and reconstruction, tap the potential of existing production equipment, and systematically select key projects to prepare for new mine construction. All capital construction must take into account the state's financial strength, fully consider its reliability and feasibility, and be carried out under economically sound principles. The central and major administrative regions' coal mine industry authorities must strengthen leadership over local coal mines, strengthen supervision and assistance to private coal mines, and assist some larger private coal mines in carrying out restoration and reconstruction work. In addition, the conference also made decisions on issues such as the use of state investment, capital construction procedures, and capital construction organization. The purpose of these decisions is to implement the state's regulations on capital construction, so that state investment can be used rationally and waste can be reduced. In order to implement the conference resolutions more effectively, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has organized inspection teams to go to the field to study relevant work with a focus.

    全国煤矿基本建设会议决定工作方针
    合理使用国家投资减少浪费
    中央人民政府燃料工业部在九月二十六日到十月五日召开的全国煤矿基本建设会议，总结了两年来煤矿工业基本建设工作的经验教训，决定了今后数年内基本建设的方针和任务。会议决定：一九五二年和最近几年煤矿工业基本建设的方针是以恢复改建为主，发挥现有生产设备的潜在能力，有步骤地选择重点进行新井建设的准备工作。一切基本建设必须照顾国家财政力量，充分考虑其可靠性和可能性，并在合乎经济原则的条件下进行。中央和各大行政区的煤矿工业主管部门都必须加强对于地方煤矿的领导，加强对于私营煤矿的监督和扶助，并帮助若干规模较大的私营煤矿进行恢复和改建工作。此外，会议对于国家投资的使用，基本建设的程序和基本建设的组织机构等问题也有所决定。这些决定的目的在于贯彻国家关于基本建设的规定，使国家投资得以合理使用，并减少浪费。中央人民政府燃料工业部为了更有效地实行大会决议，已组织检查组有重点地前往现场研究各项有关工作。（新华社）
