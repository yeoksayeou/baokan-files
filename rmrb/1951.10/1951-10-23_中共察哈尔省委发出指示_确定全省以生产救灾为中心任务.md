CPC Chahar Provincial Committee Issues Instructions
    Defining the province's central task as production for disaster relief
    This year, Chahar Province has suffered widespread frost damage. It is estimated that the province will only have slightly more than 30% of a normal harvest, and there are more than three million disaster victims. Therefore, the CPC Chahar Provincial Committee has instructed Party committees at all levels to regard production for disaster relief as the overriding central task for the province at present; otherwise, a serious political error will be committed. The instructions specifically mentioned that Chairman Mao and the Central Committee are very concerned about the disaster situation in Chahar Province and have repeatedly instructed that production for disaster relief must be done well to ensure that no one starves to death and that disaster victims are not displaced. The Chahar Provincial Committee pointed out that the Chahar Provincial People's Government has issued instructions requiring the development of a production for disaster relief campaign centered on autumn plowing. This should be the common task of all Party, government, and people's organizations in the province, and it must be fully realized.
    The instructions stated that in order to accomplish this task, it is necessary to seize the opportunity, assign dedicated personnel, plan carefully, concentrate efforts, go deep into villages and households, and conduct timely inspections; it is necessary to mobilize Party members, Youth League members, and labor models to lead the masses, organize them, help each other, and solve problems locally in accordance with local conditions. In addition, it is necessary to supplement this with work-for-relief projects, organizing the masses to work elsewhere, urban assistance, and necessary relief efforts. As long as we follow the above principles, formulate practical and feasible plans, send strong cadres deep into the countryside, mobilize the masses, and create a mass movement and competition movement for production and self-salvation; and with the help of higher levels and neighboring regions, we are confident and sure of overcoming the famine; and it is possible to further advance the economy of Chahar Province through production for disaster relief.
    The instructions stated that in order to accomplish this task, the provincial-level organs of Chahar Province have organized hundreds of cadres to go to the countryside to work, and have determined that each director of department, bureau, and office will be responsible for one county until the next year when the disaster is overcome. Special districts, counties, and districts should also send a large number of cadres and follow the methods of the provincial-level organs. In addition to representing the higher levels to convey opinions and provide guidance, all cadres sent to the countryside must obey the unified leadership of the local Party and government, so as to act in a unified manner and victoriously complete the glorious task of production and self-salvation.

    中共察哈尔省委发出指示
    确定全省以生产救灾为中心任务
    今年察哈尔省普遭霜灾，估计全省仅能有三成稍多一点的年景，灾民有三百多万。因此中共察哈尔省委指示各级党委，应把生产救灾作为全省当前压倒一切的中心任务；否则，就会犯严重的政治错误。指示中特别提到：毛主席和中央十分关怀察哈尔省的灾情，曾一再指示必须把生产救灾工作做好，保证不饿死一个人，不使灾民流离失所。察哈尔省委指出：察哈尔省人民政府已发出指示，要求以秋耕为中心，开展生产救灾运动，这应该是全省党、政机关和人民团体的共同任务，必须使之全部实现。
    指示中提出：要完成这一任务，必须抓紧时机，专人负责，精心计划，集中力量，深入村户，及时检查；必须发动党员、团员、劳动模范带动群众，组织起来，互助互济，因地制宜，就地解决问题。此外还须辅之以以工代赈，组织群众外出作工，城市援助和必要的救济等办法。只要我们遵照以上原则，拟定切实可行的计划，派强有力的干部深入农村，把群众发动起来，上下一起，造成生产自救的群众运动和竞赛运动；再加以上级和友邻区的帮助，我们是有信心有把握度过灾荒的；并有可能经过生产救灾而把察哈尔省的经济向前推进一步。
    指示称：现在察哈尔省省级机关为了完成这一任务，已组织几百个干部下乡工作，并确定各部、厅、局长各负一县之专责，直到明年度过灾荒为止。各专区、县、区亦应派出大批干部，仿照省级机关的办法办理。各下乡干部除代表上级传达意见进行指导外，必须服从当地党、政的统一领导，以便统一行动，胜利完成生产自救的光荣任务。
