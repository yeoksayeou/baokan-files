Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 23rd: The Korean War has greatly impacted the status of all classes of American society. The changes it has brought to American socio-economic life can be conveniently expressed by the following formula: the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. The profits of the bourgeoisie have greatly increased, while the living standards of the broad masses have declined. The broad masses of the people are increasingly dissatisfied with the government's war policy.

On the eve of the Korean War, American capitalists fearfully watched the signs of the approaching economic crisis and hoped that some "new and powerful stimulus" would appear for the American economy. The US government very diligently gave them this "powerful stimulus" in the form of the Korean War and massive increases in military spending. The government used the money it squeezed from the people to pay for increasing military orders, enabling arms manufacturers to obtain unprecedented profits. In the first half of 1950, the total profits of American companies (before taxes) were $17.35 billion, $24 billion in the second half of the year, and $25 billion in the first half of this year. At the same time, due to rising living costs and increased taxes, the real wages of workers and staff have been greatly reduced. According to official figures, the US cost of living index has risen by 9.5 percent since the start of the Korean War. However, these official averages do not reflect the true and even greater decline in the living standards of American workers. For example, the prices of meat and some other foods have risen sharply. In industrial centers, meat prices have risen by 20 percent, milk by 30 percent, and eggs by 50 percent. After the relaxation of rent control laws, rents in some cities have risen by 30 to 100 percent. At the same time, capitalists have also shifted the burden of war preparation and military buildup onto the working people. Since the end of 1950, the average taxes paid by workers have been 20 percent higher than before the Korean War. The new tax law will increase workers' taxes by another 12 percent. Workers' dissatisfaction is manifested in the rising wave of strikes in the United States. Despite the suppression by corrupt trade union bosses and the vicious attacks by the bourgeois press, American workers continue to hold strikes.

Small and medium-sized farmers, in addition to feeling the increasing burden of taxes, also feel the burden of rising prices of agricultural machinery, inorganic fertilizers, and other items necessary for cultivation. In addition, many farmers complain that the government is conscripting their sons into military service, thereby undermining their economy.

The American workers' will to end the Korean War can be seen in the many resolutions passed by various independent progressive trade unions with a total membership of approximately 500,000. These resolutions call for an immediate end to the Korean War and the resolution of all issues through diplomatic means.

The large number of letters written to President Truman, members of Congress, and newspaper editors expressed the people's hatred and protest against America's bloody adventure. The "Philadelphia Evening Bulletin" recently admitted: Never have so many people written so many letters to members of Congress in Washington so frequently. The newspaper said that the theme of these letters is: Let our children come back from Korea. These letters were written by representatives of all classes of people. The mothers and wives of American soldiers expressed the most vehement protests against the Korean adventure in their letters.

The widespread evasion of conscription by the American masses prominently demonstrates the attitude of the entire American people towards the Korean War. People are doing everything possible to achieve this goal, such as bribing doctors, feigning illness, refusing to fight on the grounds of religious and moral beliefs, or simply forging documents. An Associated Press dispatch from Buffalo on October 19 stated: The stealing of draft registration certificates by middle school students is rampant there. From this, one can see how students steal and buy draft registration certificates to avoid real registration. The "Oklahoma Daily," which is widely sold in the southwestern United States, wrote: It is a startling fact that many future soldiers are trying their best to evade military service.

    侵朝战争使美国大资本家获得暴利人民生活水平降低
    美国广大人民日益不满杜鲁门战争政策
    工人罢工浪潮高涨，群众极力逃避兵役
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：朝鲜战争对美国社会各阶层的地位发生了很大影响。它对美国社会经济生活所造成的变化可以很方便地以下面的公式表示出来，即：富者愈富，穷者愈穷。资产阶级的利润大大增加了，同时广大群众的生活水平却降低了。广大人民对政府的战争政策日益不满。
    在朝鲜战争前夕，美国资本家恐惧地注视着正在来临的经济危机的征兆，并希望会有某种对美国经济的“新的有力的刺激”出现。美国政府很殷勤地以朝鲜战争和大量增加军费的方式给了他们这个“有力的刺激”。政府拿人民头上搜刮来的钱支付日益增加的军事订货，使军火制造商获得空前的利润。在一九五○年上半年，美国公司的全部利润（在纳税前）是一百七十三亿五千万美元，同年下半年是二百四十亿美元，今年上半年是二百五十亿美元。同时，由于生活费用的上涨和赋税的提高，工人和职员的实际工资大大减少了。按照官方数字，美国生活费用的指数从朝鲜战争开始以来已上升了百分之九点五。但这些官方的平均数字并不能反映出美国工人生活水平真正的、比这还要大的下降。举例说，肉类及若干其他食品的价格已经急剧上涨。在工业中心，肉类价格上涨百分之二十，牛奶上涨百分之三十，鸡蛋上涨百分之五十。房租管制法放松后，有些城市的房租已上涨了百分之三十至一百。同时，资本家把准备战争和整顿军备的负担也转嫁到劳动人民身上。从一九五零年年底以来，工人所纳的税平均比朝鲜战争前高出百分之二十。新税法将使工人所纳的税再增加百分之十二。工人的不满表现在美国日益高涨的罢工浪潮上，虽然有着腐化的工会头子的压制和资产阶级报纸的恶毒攻击，美国工人仍然不断举行罢工。
    小农和中农除感到赋税的负担日益加重之外，还感到农业机器、无机肥料以及为耕作所必需的其他物品价格上升的负担。此外，许多农民抱怨政府征召他们的儿子去服军役，因而破坏了他们的经济。
    美国工人要求结束朝鲜战争的意志，可以从总共拥有会员约五十万人的各独立的进步工会所通过的许多决议案中表现出来。这些决议案要求立即结束朝鲜战争，以外交方法解决一切问题。
    写给杜鲁门总统、国会议员和各报编辑部的大批信件，表现了人民对美国血腥冒险的痛恨和抗议。“费城晚邮报”最近承认：从来没有这样多的人这样经常地给华盛顿的国会议员写这样多的信。该报说，这些信的主题是：让我们的孩子从朝鲜回来。这些信是各阶层人民的代表写来的。美国士兵的母亲和妻子在她们的信里对朝鲜冒险提出了最激愤的抗议。
    美国群众大批逃避被征入伍的情况，突出地表明了全体美国人民对朝鲜战争的态度。人们千方百计地利用各种手段来达到这个目的，例如贿赂医生、装病、藉口宗教和道德的信仰不去作战，或者干脆伪造证件。美联社十月十九日自布法罗发出的电讯说：那里的中学生偷窃征兵登记证之风盛行。从这里就可以看到：学生如何偷买征兵登记证来避免进行真正的登记。盛销美国西南部的“俄克拉何马日报”写道：许多未来的士兵极力逃避兵役是一件惊人的事实。
