    To the respected Chairman Mao:
    Under the guidance of your wise "leaning to one side" policy, we have established more than 46,000 Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations across the country in the past two years, comprehensively carrying out internationalist ideological education on Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union. This has greatly enhanced and consolidated the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, promoted the exchange of all wisdom and experience between the two great nations, and developed our organization into a strong force with more than 17 million members.
    Today, American imperialism has blatantly concluded an illegal peace treaty with the remnants of Japanese imperialism, intending to be enemies with the people of China and the Soviet Union, with the people of Asia, and with the people of the world. Under these circumstances, further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union is absolutely necessary for the cause of defending Asian peace and world security.
    We, more than 240 representatives from all regions, classes, nationalities, and troops across the country, held the first National Congress in your location—the capital Beijing—and feel infinite happiness and excitement. At this meeting, we earnestly summarized the experiences of the past two years, reviewed the shortcomings in our work, and clearly defined the future direction and tasks of our work. As the meeting closes today, we would like to assure you that we will resolutely implement the various resolutions and decisions of this meeting, further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.
    Long live the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the great People's Republic of China!
    Long live the indestructible friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    All representatives of the First National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    October 13, 1951

    中苏友协全国代表会议
    致毛主席电敬爱的毛主席：
    我们在您英明的“一面倒”政策的指导下，两年中间已经在全国建立了四万六千多个中苏友好协会的组织，全面地开展了中苏友好、学习苏联的国际主义的思想教育工作，因而大大地增进和巩固了中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友谊与合作，促进了中苏两大民族的一切智慧和经验的交流，并使我们的组织发展成了拥有一千七百多万会员的壮大的队伍。
    在今天，美帝国主义已经明目张胆地和日本帝国主义的残余分子缔结了非法的对日和约，存心与中苏两国人民、与亚洲人民、与世界人民为敌。在这种情况之下，更进一步加强中苏两国人民的友好与合作，对于亚洲和平与世界安全的保卫事业是有绝对的必要。
    我们来自全国各地区、各阶级、各民族、各部队的二百四十多名代表，在您的所在地——首都北京，举行了第一次全国代表会议，感到无限的幸福和兴奋。我们在这次会议上认真地总结了两年来的经验，检讨了我们工作中的缺点，并且明确地规定了今后工作的方针和任务。当今天会议闭幕之际，我们谨向您保证坚决执行这次会议的各项决议和决定，更加加强中苏友好保卫远东与世界的和平。
    伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中苏两国人民不可摧毁的友谊万岁！
    中苏友好协会第一次全国代表会议全体代表
    一九五一年十月十三日
