Damdinsuren, head of the Mongolian People's Observation Delegation invited to participate in our country's Second National Day celebration, member of the World Peace Council, and writer, visited the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles at 9:00 AM on the 10th.茅盾 (Mao Dun), Vice Chairman, and 周扬 (Zhou Yang) personally received him, exchanging information about the literary and artistic aspects of both countries. The head of the Mongolian delegation presented our literary and artistic circles with various valuable gifts, including two oil paintings depicting the happy lives of the people of Outer Mongolia, three Outer Mongolian embroideries, and various books.
    The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has recently received a large number of gifts for our literary and artistic circles from organizations such as the Korean Writers Union, the Romanian Writers Association, the German League for Cultural Renewal, and the Burma-China Friendship Association. In addition to books and periodicals, there are also ancient musical instruments and exquisite handicrafts. Among them, the Korean Writers Union sent a silk banner signed by many famous Korean writers. There is also a beautifully crafted photo album containing photos of the heroic deeds of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side.
    The Jinling University and Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, formerly subsidized by the United States, were officially taken over by the Education Department of the East China Military and Political Committee on September 19th, and the two schools were merged and renamed Public Jinling University. The school affairs committee, composed of 13 representatives from the original administrative authorities, teachers, and student unions of the two schools, has been established with the approval of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. Li Fangxun and Wu Yifang serve as the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee. More than 1,500 teachers, students, and staff held a celebration meeting on September 19th to celebrate the establishment of the school. Tang Shouyu, Deputy Minister of the Education Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, Ke Qingshi, Mayor of Nanjing Municipal People's Government, and 50 representatives from all walks of life attended to offer their congratulations.
    When the news that the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government approved the merger of the two schools and their conversion into public institutions was announced this May, all the teachers and students were overjoyed. During the summer vacation, more than 400 teachers, students, and staff stayed at the school to help with the inventory of materials, and they completed the inventory of the two schools in ten days.
