Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily:

To the Editors:
    Jia Xiangju, a woman from Yuanjia Village, Eighth District, Qihe County, Shandong Province, was driven to suicide due to unbearable abuse from her husband and mother-in-law. Our district government mishandled this matter. After Comrade Song Yi exposed this in your newspaper on September 19th, we have not only conducted a self-criticism but also re-processed the case.
    First, it should be pointed out that Jia Xiangju was right to request the township government to resolve her marriage issue after being beaten by her husband. Township Chief Wei Yunsheng was wrong to reprimand Jia Xiangju based on what her mother-in-law said. Wei Yunsheng bears some responsibility for Jia Xiangju's forced suicide. Secondly, District cadre Feng Jinsheng's casual remark to those requesting the handling of this case, "She deserved to die, it's nothing," also demonstrates the confusion in Feng Jinsheng's thinking. Jia Xiangju died on September 3rd, but the district government did not immediately handle it, delaying the arrest and delivery of Hao Maozhi to the county people's court until September 14th, which shows that we did not take responsibility for this matter. In short, the incident of Jia Xiangju's forced suicide illustrates our lack of understanding of the Marriage Law, which prevents us from implementing the spirit of the Marriage Law. This is due to our lack of regular study.
    Currently, Hao Maozhi, who beat Jia Xiangju, is being tried in the County People's Court; Township Chief Wei Yunsheng has been dismissed with the approval of higher authorities; District cadre Feng Jinsheng has made a self-criticism.
    Through the lessons of this incident, we are determined to lead cadres in diligently studying the Marriage Law, publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law to the masses, and ensuring that similar unfortunate incidents do not occur again in the future.
                Eighth District People's Government of Qihe County, Shandong Province

### 山东齐河八区人民政府关于错误处理贾象菊婚姻问题的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    山东齐河八区人民政府关于错误处理贾象菊婚姻问题的检讨编辑同志：
    山东省齐河县八区袁家庄妇女贾象菊，不堪丈夫、婆母虐待，被迫自杀。我区政府对此事处理不当。经宋意同志于你报九月十九日揭露后，我们除检讨外，并重新作了处理。
    首先应该指出，贾象菊被丈夫毒打后，向乡政府要求解决婚姻问题，这是应该的。乡长魏云胜听信她婆母的话，反而斥责贾象菊，这是错误的。贾象菊被迫自杀，魏云胜要负一定的责任。其次，区干部冯金声信口向要求处理此案的人说：“她自己该死，这个算不得什么。”这也表现了冯金声思想的混乱。贾象菊的死是九月三日，可是区政府未立即处理，拖到九月十四日，才将郝茂芝捕获送县人民法院处理，这说明我们对此事没有负起责任。总之，从贾象菊被迫自杀这一事件中，说明了我们对婚姻法缺乏了解，因此也就不能贯彻婚姻法的精神，这是由于我们平时不学习造成的。
    现在，毒打贾象菊的郝茂芝正在县人民法院审理中；该乡乡长魏云胜已经上级批准，给予撤职处分；区干部冯金声已经作了检讨。
    通过这一事件的教训，我们决领导干部努力学习婚姻法，并向群众宣传与贯彻执行婚姻法，保证今后不再发生类似的不幸事件。
                山东省齐河县第八区人民政府
