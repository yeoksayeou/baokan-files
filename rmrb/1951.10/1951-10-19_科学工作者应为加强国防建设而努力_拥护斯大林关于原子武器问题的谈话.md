    Scientific Workers Should Strive to Strengthen National Defense
    ——Supporting Stalin's Talk on Atomic Weapons
             Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    On October 6th, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published Marshal Stalin's answers to questions from a Pravda reporter regarding atomic weapons. Stalin's talk explained the role of the Soviet Union's mastery of atomic weapons and its sincere stance and desire for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the implementation of international control of atomic weapons. This talk has been unanimously supported by peace-loving people around the world and has been hailed by scientists worldwide.
    It is well known that the ability to harness atomic energy for human use is the result of the joint efforts of outstanding scientists from various countries over the past forty years. However, when American imperialism saw that this scientific achievement could be used for its ambition to dominate the world, it rudely monopolized it, not allowing the scientific community to exchange research results, restricting the freedom of life of scientific personnel, forcing them to manufacture atomic weapons, and in August 1945, cruelly dropping its then only two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, attempting to cover the world's eyes and ears, and steal the fruits of victory in the war against Japan. Since then, the United States has been trying to monopolize atomic secrets as a tool to realize its ambition to dominate the world.
    At the end of 1946, under the leadership of the famous physicist Joliot-Curie, who made fundamental contributions to the study of atomic energy, progressive scientists from various countries organized the World Federation of Scientific Workers and proposed a resolution to ban atomic weapons and subject atomic energy raw materials to international control so that they could be used for the benefit of mankind. This proposal immediately received sympathy and support from the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies; but the United States responded to this just proposal by manufacturing atomic bombs in even larger quantities. I remember that during the conference of this alliance, I asked Mr. Joliot-Curie: "How can the United States be made to give up its ambition to dominate the world?" His answer was very clear: "First of all, we must awaken the world's attention to the ambitions of the United States; but the important thing is that the Soviet Union can manufacture similar weapons as soon as possible. Only in this way will the United States be forced to discuss issues with other countries on an equal footing."
    In order to safeguard the security of socialist countries and world peace, Soviet scientific and technical workers, under the leadership of the great Stalin, collectively engaged in the research of atomic energy and have achieved great success. This achievement is by no means accidental. This is due to the Soviet Union's glorious historical tradition and high achievements in physical science in the past. The early discoverer of the periodic table of elements, Mendeleev, the recent discoverer of cosmic ray showers, Skobeltsyn, chairman of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee, Veksler, the inventor of the super-type atomic fragmentation machine, and Alikhanov, the discoverer of "variations," are representatives of these outstanding scientists. Even during the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War, a considerable number of outstanding scientists were engaged in basic and applied research in atomic physics. This arduous effort by Soviet scientists, coupled with the Soviet Union's high level of industrial technology, has led to the rapid development of the Soviet Union's atomic energy industry.
    It is well known that Molotov said in 1947 that the atomic secret was no longer a secret. At that time, the warmongers in the United States and Britain did not believe it and thought it was a Soviet bluff. On September 24, 1949, TASS officially declared that the Soviet Union had long had atomic weapons available for use, but still adhered to the position of unconditionally prohibiting atomic weapons and still believed that the production of atomic weapons must be controlled. In fact, in July 1949, the Soviet Union used atomic bombs as explosives to bomb the rocks that blocked the south flow of the two large Siberian rivers (the Ob and Yenisei Rivers); these two rivers were prepared to irrigate the vast desert areas of Central Asia and turn them into fertile areas, and could advance the great Davydov's Central Asian plan by several years. This explosion of an atomic bomb for peaceful purposes frightened Truman and the bosses on Wall Street; at the same time, peace-loving people all over the world were greatly encouraged.
    Stalin's talk this time is exactly the gospel that peace-loving people all over the world have been hoping to hear, and it is even better news that scientists have been longing for. As Joliot-Curie said in 1946: Only when the Soviet Union has atomic weapons will the United States be forced to discuss issues with other countries on an equal footing. Stalin said it even more clearly: "I think only when those who advocate atomic bombs see that they are no longer monopolists will they agree to ban atomic weapons."
    We Chinese scientists, like other peace-loving people, have received great enlightenment from Stalin's talk: only by holding our own weapons tightly can we make the enemy lay down their weapons. We should abandon the incorrect view of "science for science" in the past, we should arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to strengthen the construction of the motherland's national defense, economy, and culture. Only in this way can we be with the people of the whole country and stride forward in the "Long March" of building the motherland; and only in this way can we, together with the peace-loving people of the world, strive forward along the path indicated by Stalin.

    科学工作者应为加强国防建设而努力
    ——拥护斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话
             中国科学院近代物理研究所所长  钱三强
    十月六日，苏联真理报刊载了斯大林大元帅关于原子武器问题的答真理报记者问。斯大林的这个谈话，说明了苏联掌握原子武器的作用和对禁用原子武器与实行原子武器国际管制的真诚主张和愿望。这个谈话，已得到全世界爱好和平人民的一致拥护，更为全世界科学工作者同声欢呼。
    人们都知道，原子能之能够为人类所用，是经过四十多年世界各国优秀科学工作者的共同努力而获得的成就。但是当美帝国主义看到这个科学成果可以为它独霸世界的野心所利用时，就粗暴地将它独占，不许科学界交换研究结果，限制科学人员的生活自由，强迫他们制造原子武器，并于一九四五年八月残酷地向日本广岛和长崎投下它那时仅有的两个原子弹，妄图以此掩尽天下耳目，以窃夺对日战争胜利的果实。在此以后，美国就一直企图垄断原子秘密，作为实现它独霸世界的野心的工具。
    一九四六年底，在对研究原子能有基本贡献的著名物理学家约里奥—居里的领导下，各国进步科学工作者组织了世界科学工作者联盟，提出了禁用原子武器，对原子能的原料加以国际管制，使它用于为人类福利的工作的决议。这个主张立刻得到了苏联和人民民主国家的同情与支持；但是美国却以更大量地制造原子弹来答复这个正义的主张。我还记得，在这个联盟开会期间，我曾问约里奥—居里先生：“怎样才能使美国放弃独霸世界的野心？”他的回答很明确：“首先要唤起全世界对美国野心的注意；但重要的是苏联能早日制造出类似的武器，只有这样，美国才会被迫地与其他国家平等地谈问题。”
    为了保卫社会主义国家的安全与世界和平，苏联的科学技术工作者在伟大的斯大林的领导下，集体地从事于原子能的研究工作，并已获得了伟大的成就。这种成就绝不是偶然得来的，这是由于苏联过去对于物理科学有着光荣的历史传统和高度的成就。早期的原素周期性的发现者门德雷也夫，近期的宇宙线簇射的发现者、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席斯科贝尔琴、超型原子破裂机的发明者维克斯勒、“变子”的发现者亚历哈诺夫等都是这些优秀科学家的代表人物。即使在苏联伟大的卫国战争期间，也曾有相当多的优秀科学工作者从事原子物理的基础与应用方面的研究。苏联科学家的这种艰苦努力，再加上苏联高度的工业技术水准，苏联的原子能工业遂得到了迅速的发展。
    人们都知道，一九四七年莫洛托夫就说过：原子秘密早已不成其为秘密了。当时美英等国的战争贩子们都不相信，认为是苏联虚张声势。一九四九年九月二十四日塔斯社正式声明：苏联早已有了原子武器可供使用，但是仍信守着无条件禁用原子武器的立场，仍认为必须管制原子武器的生产。事实上，在一九四九年七月，苏联就利用了原子弹作爆炸物，轰炸阻碍西伯利亚的两条大河流（鄂比河和叶尼塞河）转向南流的岩石；这两条河流是预备用来灌溉中亚细亚的广大沙漠地带，使之变成肥沃地区的，并且可使伟大的达维多夫的中亚细亚计划提早若干年完成。这一个用于和平事业的原子弹的爆炸，吓坏了杜鲁门和华尔街的老板们；同时，全世界爱好和平的人们却得到了极大的鼓舞。
    这次斯大林的谈话，正是全世界爱好和平人们最盼望听到的福音，更是科学工作者企望已久的好消息。正如约里奥—居里在一九四六年讲过的：只有苏联有了原子武器，美国才会被迫地与其他国家平等地谈问题。斯大林说得更清楚：“我想，只有鼓吹原子弹的人看到他们已不再是垄断者的时候，他们才可能同意禁止原子武器。”
    我们中国科学工作者与其他爱好和平的人们一样，在斯大林的谈话中得到了极大的启示：只有紧握着自己的武器，才能使敌人放下武器。我们应该放弃过去“为科学而科学”的不正确的观点，应该用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想将我们武装起来，为加强祖国的国防、经济和文化的建设而努力。只有这样，我们才能和全国人民在一起，在建设祖国的“万里长征”中迈步前进；也只有这样，我们才能与世界爱好和平的人民一起，循着斯大林指示的道路奋斗前进。
