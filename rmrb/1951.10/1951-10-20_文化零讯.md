The magazine version of the publication is distributed by Xinhua Bookstore, and the newspaper version is distributed by the post office.
    The 25th issue of "Current Affairs Handbook" is published today. This issue is almost entirely devoted to articles, materials, and pictures commemorating the first anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Liao Gailong's "Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Participation in the War" and Wang Fei's "The Great Victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in One Year" analyze the progress of the war over the past year, its domestic and foreign impact, and the direction of the national people's future efforts to strengthen the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. In addition, there are two pieces of material exposing the shamelessness and atrocities of the U.S. aggressors, several allegros created by volunteer soldiers, and a number of propaganda posters.
    Other articles in this issue are: Tang Zhenzong's "The Great Unity of All Nationalities in China" and "Half-Monthly Review of Current Affairs" for the first half of October.
    The recently published issue 39 of the Soviet magazine "New Times" contains an article by Chinese affairs expert A. Astafyev, "Life in New China." Based on materials from the "People's China" magazine published in Beijing, the author introduces in detail the achievements of New China in consolidating the people's democratic regime, land reform, industrial and agricultural production, and cultural education. He points out that "People's China" magazine is carrying out an important task - consolidating the friendship between the great people of China and the Soviet Union.
    The 26 counselors of the Chinese Young Pioneers team who visited the Soviet Young Pioneers activities team returned to Beijing on the morning of the 14th. The delegation visited the Soviet Union for nearly three months and learned the rich and advanced experience of the Soviet Young Pioneers, such as the work of the Young Pioneers in schools and the work of children's after-school organizations. During their visit to the Soviet Union, the delegation was warmly welcomed by Soviet youth and Young Pioneers.
    A total of more than 1,900 students and some teachers from the faculties of arts and law of eight public institutions of higher learning in East China, including Fudan University, Nanjing University, Jinling University, Zhejiang University, Anhui University, Fuzhou University, Fujian Normal College, and Xiamen University, have successively gone to the areas in East China where land reform is underway to participate in land reform work. Before leaving school, teachers and students from all schools studied relevant land reform documents. Teachers and students from Fudan University in Shanghai also invited Liu Ruilong, deputy director of the Land Reform Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee, to give a report on land reform. They also visited the land reform exhibitions in the suburbs of Shanghai and the Sunan area.
    West China Union University in Chengdu, which accepted U.S. subsidies, has been taken over by the Cultural and Educational Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee and renamed the public West China University. The school's 3,000 faculty, staff, and students held a grand celebration ceremony on the 6th. Fu Ke and Li Yizhou, representatives of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and Chu Tunan, Minister of Culture and Education of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, attended the ceremony. The newly appointed President Liu Chengzhao also took office on the same day.
    Mr. Pan Dayu of Suzhou recently donated his family's collection of Zhou Dynasty bronzes, the "Da Yu Ding" and the "Da Ke Ding," to the People's Government. The patterns and workmanship of these two tripods are extremely exquisite and rare among contemporary ritual vessels. The tripods also have inscriptions, which are valuable materials for studying ancient Chinese history, the social system of the Western Zhou Dynasty, and art archaeology. The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government specially issued a certificate of commendation to Mr. Pan Dayu for this.
