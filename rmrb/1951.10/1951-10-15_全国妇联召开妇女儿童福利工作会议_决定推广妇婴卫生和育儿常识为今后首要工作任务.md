The All-China Democratic Women's Federation convened its first Women and Children's Welfare Work Conference in Beijing from the 2nd to the 12th to further promote women and children's welfare work throughout the country. The conference analyzed the situation of women and children's welfare work in various regions over the past two years and decided on the guiding principles and tasks for the future.

The meeting pointed out that the women and children's welfare undertakings in various regions have been developing rapidly in the past two years. The number of public and private childcare organizations (excluding seasonal agricultural childcare organizations) across the country has increased approximately nine times compared to before liberation, benefiting more than 500,000 children of the working people. Among them, the development of childcare organizations in factories and mines has been the fastest. Many rural areas have also begun to establish seasonal mutual aid agricultural childcare organizations. More than 10,000 agricultural childcare organizations have been established nationwide this year, an increase of more than 106 times compared to last year. The development of childcare organizations has greatly reduced the burden on some working women, allowing them to devote more energy to labor production. Many regions across the country have carried out the transformation of old midwives and promoted new midwifery methods, significantly reducing maternal illness and infant mortality rates.

The meeting pointed out that the main shortcomings in the work of various regions are the lack of a comprehensive understanding of women and children's welfare work. Some regions focus their work on childcare, believing that women and children's welfare work is only about running a few nurseries and solving the childcare problems of some female workers and cadres. Some regions have set the standards for nurseries too high, deviating from reality, and therefore have failed to carry out work in a planned and step-by-step manner to serve more working women and their children.

In response to these situations, the representatives at the meeting repeatedly conducted group and plenary discussions, and finally unanimously agreed that the primary task for the future is to promote maternal and infant hygiene and childcare knowledge among the broad masses of working women.

The meeting believed that doing a good job in women and children's welfare work is not only beneficial to the cause of women's liberation, but more importantly, it can increase the labor force in all aspects of the country, directly contributing to the construction of the new China, and it is also a necessary condition for ensuring national health and the happiness of future generations. Therefore, this is a very important, glorious, and arduous revolutionary task. The meeting called on women and children's welfare workers across the country to engage in their work with high political enthusiasm and full confidence.

The meeting particularly emphasized the mass viewpoint and comprehensive viewpoint of women and children's welfare work. At present, only six out of every thousand preschool children across the country receive education in childcare organizations. The majority of pregnant women and newborn infants are still under the threat of death due to backward old-fashioned midwifery! Therefore, women and children's welfare work must actively cooperate with government health administrative departments to vigorously and universally promote new midwifery methods, publicize childcare knowledge, reduce the suffering of women in childbirth, and lower infant mortality rates.

The meeting also clearly pointed out that to do a good job in women and children's welfare work, it is necessary to proceed from reality, mobilize the masses, and use the wisdom and labor of the masses to overcome various difficulties. Regarding this issue, the meeting exchanged many typical experiences. Examples such as the neighborhood nurseries in Shanghai, the breastfeeding rooms for primary school teachers in Shenyang, and the maternal and child health work in Pingyuan Province are all successful examples.

After ten days of meetings, the representatives felt that they had learned a lot, increased their confidence in their work, and expressed their intention to implement the spirit of the meeting after returning.

Attending the meeting were standing committee members and executive committee members of the All-China Women's Federation in Beijing, welfare ministers from women's federations in Beijing, Tianjin, major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, experts in women and children's welfare work, cadres who have been engaged in women and children's welfare work for a long time, and representatives from relevant agencies and organizations, totaling more than 150 people. The meeting was presided over by Kang Keqing, Minister of Welfare of the All-China Women's Federation. Deng Yingchao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation and Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, personally guided the meeting.

During the meeting, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation and Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, Soong Ching Ling, met with all the representatives, and Hu Qiaomu, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, gave a political report to the meeting.

    全国妇联召开妇女儿童福利工作会议
    决定推广妇婴卫生和育儿常识为今后首要工作任务
    为了进一步推动全国妇女儿童福利工作，中华全国民主妇女联合会在二日至十二日在京召开了第一次妇女儿童福利工作会议。会议分析了两年来各地妇女儿童福利工作的情况，并决定了今后的方针任务。
    会议指出：两年来各地的妇女儿童福利事业在迅速的发展中。全国各地的公私立托儿组织（农忙托儿组织除外）比解放前约增加了九倍，受保教的劳动人民的子女达五十万以上。其中以工矿托儿组织发展最快。许多农村也开始设立季节性的互助变工的农忙托儿组织。今年全国建立的农忙托儿组织达一万多处，比去年增加了一百零六倍强。托儿组织的发展大大减轻了部分劳动妇女的负担，使她们把更多的力量放到劳动生产上去。全国许多地区进行了旧产婆改造工作和推行了新接生法，产妇疾病和婴儿死亡率已较前大为减少。
    会议指出：各地工作中的主要缺点是对妇女儿童福利工作缺乏全面的认识，有些地区把工作偏重在儿童保育方面，认为妇女儿童福利工作只是办好几个托儿所、解决部分女工、女干部的孩子问题。有些地区把托儿所的标准提得过高，脱离实际，因而未能有计划有步骤地开展工作，为更多的劳动妇女及其子女服务。
    针对这些情况，到会代表反复地进行了小组和大会的讨论，最后一致同意今后的工作任务首先是在广大劳动妇女中推广妇婴卫生和育儿常识。
    会议认为：作好妇女儿童福利工作，不仅仅对妇女解放事业有利，主要的是它可以增加国家各方面的劳动力量，直接有助于新中国的建设事业，而且它又是保障民族健康和后代幸福的必要条件。因此这是十分重要的光荣的艰巨的革命工作。会议号召全国的妇女儿童福利工作者要以高度的政治热情和满怀信心来从事自己的工作。
    会议特别强调妇女儿童福利工作的群众观点与全面观点。目前全国各地的学龄前儿童，每千人中只有六人受到托儿组织的教养。大多数的产妇和初生婴儿还在落后的旧法接产下，受着死亡的威胁！因此妇女儿童福利工作必须积极配合政府卫生行政部门，大力和普遍地推行新法接生，宣传育儿知识，减少妇女生育的疾苦；降低婴儿死亡率。
    会议也明确指出了要办好妇女儿童福利工作，必须从实际出发，发动群众，运用群众的智慧和劳力来克服种种困难。关于这一问题，会议上交流了许多典型经验。如上海市的里弄托儿站，沈阳的小学教员哺乳室，平原省的妇幼卫生工作都是成功的例子。
    经过十天的会议，到会的代表都觉得学到了不少的东西，提高了工作的信心，纷纷表示回去后要贯彻会议的精神。
    出席这次会议的有全国妇联在京常委、执委，北京、天津和各大行政区各省、市妇联的福利部长，妇女儿童福利工作专家，长期从事妇女儿童福利工作的干部和有关机关、团体的代表共一百五十余人。会议由全国妇联福利部长康克清主持。全国妇联副主席邓颖超，全国妇联副主席、中央人民政府卫生部部长李德全都亲自指导了会议的进行。
    会议期间，全国妇联名誉主席、中央人民政府副主席宋庆龄曾到会与全体代表见面，中共中央宣传部副部长胡乔木曾向会议作了政治报告。
