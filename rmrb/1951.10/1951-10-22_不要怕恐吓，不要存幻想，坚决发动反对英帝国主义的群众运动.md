    Don't Fear Intimidation, Don't Harbor Illusions, Resolutely Launch a Mass Movement Against British Imperialism
    The Egyptian people's movement for independence and autonomy against British imperialism has expanded to the Middle East countries. According to news revealed by British and American bourgeois news agencies, Iran, Syria, Lebanon and other countries have held angry mass demonstrations to aid the Egyptian people. The Iranian people said: "Long live our Egyptian brothers!" Obviously, the Egyptian people's heroic struggle has triggered centuries of deep-seated hatred among the people of the Middle East. British imperialism has always been the most ferocious enemy of the people of the Middle East. The Suez Canal and oil wells should have been a source of happiness for the people of the Middle East, but under the domination of British imperialism, they have become shackles enslaving the people of the Middle East, just like Malta in the Mediterranean. Now is the time for the Egyptian and Middle Eastern people to end their historical humiliation and disaster.
    British imperialism is now constantly increasing its troops to Egypt, attempting to maintain the unequal treaties that have been abolished by Egypt by force, and consolidate its rule in Egypt, especially the Suez Canal Zone. On the 19th, the British government even absurdly sent a note to Egypt, demanding that Egypt compensate for the "500,000 pounds of losses" suffered in the Egyptian people's resistance struggle caused by the British invasion! Britain has occupied Egypt for seventy years, killing countless Egyptian people and plundering countless wealth. On October 16th, it even opened fire on the Egyptian people in the Suez Canal Zone, causing many deaths and injuries. What kind of "losses" do the Egyptian people still have to "compensate" Britain for? Killing Egyptians and demanding "compensation" from Egypt is extremely rogue blackmail and extremely vicious intimidation. The Egyptian people and the Middle Eastern people should not fear such bluffing intimidation by the British bourgeoisie. Know that British imperialism is already a plucked, dying beast that cannot withstand struggle.
    In the anti-British struggle, the Egyptian and Middle Eastern people must not harbor any illusions about American imperialism. The United States is an imperialist attempting to replace Britain in invading the Middle East. American imperialism has obvious contradictions with Britain in the struggle for hegemony in the Middle East, but it is a more ferocious enemy to the people of the Middle East. If any illusions are harbored about the United States, it will inevitably lead to painful consequences.
    The key to the victory of the Egyptian and Middle Eastern people's independence and autonomy movement lies in fully mobilizing and uniting the broad masses of the people at home, and uniting with peace-loving people around the world to resolutely fight against British and American imperialism. The masses are the most fundamental reliance in the anti-imperialist struggle. Without a strong mass base, the anti-imperialist movement cannot last.
    In the situation of Britain gradually increasing its troops, the Egyptian and Middle Eastern people should make thorough preparations for the struggle to prevent sudden attacks by the British army.

### 不要怕恐吓，不要存幻想，坚决发动反对英帝国主义的群众运动

    不要怕恐吓，不要存幻想，坚决发动反对英帝国主义的群众运动
    埃及人民的反对英帝国主义的独立自主运动，已扩大到中东各国。据英美资产阶级通讯社所透露的消息看来，伊朗、叙利亚、黎巴嫩等国，均举行了愤怒的援助埃及人民的群众示威，伊朗人民说：“我们的埃及弟兄们万岁！”很显然，埃及人民的英勇斗争，在中东各国人民中引发了几世纪来深沉的仇恨。英帝国主义从来就是中东各国人民最凶恶的敌人，苏彝士运河和石油井本来应当是中东各国人民幸福之源，但是它们却在英帝国主义宰割之下和地中海中马尔他岛一样，成为奴役中东人民的枷锁。现在是埃及和中东人民结束历史性的屈辱和灾难的时候了。
    英帝国主义现在不断向埃及增兵，企图以武力保持已被埃及废除的不平等条约，巩固它在埃及特别是苏彝士运河区的统治；十九日英国政府更荒谬绝伦地照会埃及，要求埃及赔偿因英国肆行侵略所引起的埃及人民的反抗斗争中所受的“五十万英镑的损失”！英国侵占埃及已七十年，不知屠杀了多少埃及人民，掠夺了多少财富，十月十六日还在苏彝士运河区对埃及人民开枪，死伤甚众，埃及人民还要“赔偿”英国什么样的“损失”呢？杀了埃及人，还要埃及“赔偿”，这是极无赖的讹诈，极狠毒的恫吓，埃及人民和中东人民不要怕英国资产阶级这种虚张声势的恐吓。要知道：英帝国主义已经是落了毛的垂死的野兽，它是经不起斗争的。
    埃及人民和中东人民在反英斗争中，对于美帝国主义不能存任何幻想。美国是正在企图代替英国侵略中东的帝国主义者，美帝国主义在争夺中东霸权上和英国有显然的矛盾，而对于中东各国人民则是更凶恶的敌人。如果对于美国存任何幻想，必然招致痛苦的后果。
    埃及和中东各国人民独立自主运动胜利的关键，在于充分发动和团结国内广大的人民群众，并联合世界上爱好和平的人民，坚决和英美帝国主义作斗争。群众是反帝斗争最基本的依靠，如果没有强大的群众基础，反帝运动是不能持久的。
    在英国逐渐增兵的情形下，埃及人民和中东人民均应作彻底进行斗争的准备，防止英军突然的袭击。
