How Beijing Mobilized Women's Participation in Politics?

    I. Situation

    In August and September, all sixteen suburban districts of Beijing convened People's Representative Conferences, exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress, and elected district heads and government committee members. The nine urban districts elected 131 government committee members, of which 21 were women, accounting for 16% of the total. The seven suburban districts elected 91 government committee members, of which 14 were women, accounting for 15.5% of the total. Among the government committee members in the sixteen districts, 35 were women, including 14 from the Women's Federation, 3 female cadres from other departments, 5 primary school principals and teachers, 5 housewives, and 8 female farmers. Among the district heads, two were women: one was a Party cadre who was re-elected, and the other was a housewife with intellectual background who was newly elected this time.

    In July and August, the suburban areas universally elected people's representatives in 171 administrative villages, 10 towns, and 15 streets, and convened village and town representative conferences to elect village, town, and street heads and government committee members. Including the 85 villages that implemented democratic governance this summer, the democratic governance work in the suburban areas has been fully completed. According to statistics from 42 villages in the 12th district, 1,847 people's representatives were elected, of which 463 were women, accounting for 25% of the total. There were 496 government committee members, of which 66 were women, accounting for slightly over 13%. In the entire suburban area, there were 21 female village, town, and street heads, with both the head and deputy head of Xibahe Village being women.

    Women played a significant role in this democratic governance movement. During the village elections in the suburbs, women actively participated, with female voters generally accounting for one-half to two-thirds of the electorate. Women enthusiastically spoke, carefully electing their representatives. The elected female representatives actively collected proposals and submitted them to the People's Representative Conferences. After the conferences, the female representatives actively conveyed and implemented the resolutions. The elected female village and town heads generally shouldered their responsibilities, leading the masses in doing a good job in resisting America, aiding Korea, and promoting production, thereby establishing their prestige. For example, the first People's Representative Conference of Dongba Town in the 10th district resolved to mobilize the masses to catch insects. Deputy Town Head Wang Lanying and government committee member Zhang Shuman (both women) immediately mobilized the masses together with all the committee members and representatives, and mobilized women through women's representative meetings. On that day, they mobilized over 1,200 people, of whom 800 to 900 were women, and caught over 40 jin of insects in two hours, persisting for seven days and eradicating all the locusts. After being elected as the head of Mayu Village in the 15th district, Ke Shufang immediately revised the village government's patriotic pledge and mobilized the masses to sign pledges. Out of more than 500 households in the village, over 400 have now signed patriotic pledges (originally only 37 households had signed). She also called on the masses to increase production and make donations. The village originally pledged over 10 million, but only paid over 50,000 yuan. Recently, they have paid over 2 million yuan.

    During this democratic governance movement, a considerable number of women were elected into leading government institutions, which had a significant social impact, especially inspiring the broad masses of women. Gu De, the Secretary of the 5th District Party Committee and concurrently the District Head, estimated the fact that a woman was elected as the Deputy District Head and three other women were elected as government committee members in that district: "It will further advance the entire democratic governance, and greatly encourage street work and women's work, because the election results show that as long as you wholeheartedly serve the people and gain their trust, regardless of whether you are male or female, you can all become the district head or a government committee member."

    In general, the masses of women actively participated in this democratic governance movement, and the number of women elected to the leading organs of the district and village governments generally met the needs and possibilities. Why is there such a result? The main reasons are two:

    On the one hand, it is the women's own conditions. After many movements, especially the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea, and Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries movements, the political consciousness of the broad masses of women, like men, has generally improved. They participated in various activities, from which a large number of activists emerged and were elected to responsible positions in various departments, thereby preparing the conditions (foundation) for women's participation in elections and being elected in this democratic governance movement. Last year, during the election of district and street representatives in urban areas, many women emphasized that they could not do it, and some did not want to be elected because of "change of dynasty" thoughts, and individual ones even cried and made a fuss about not wanting to do it. This year's situation is completely different. This time, when districts and villages conducted democratic elections, women were generally active. They realized the loveliness of the motherland, understood the relationship between participating in democratic governance and women's liberation, and those elected were willing to work for everyone, knowing that being a representative or a committee member is glorious.

    On the other hand, it is the leadership's attention and support for women's participation in political activities and government work. When Mayor Peng Zhen made a report on election issues to all the people's representatives of the districts, he specifically pointed out the necessity of women's participation in politics. Obviously, only when women have a certain number among the government committee members can a comprehensive view be taken into account. Why should the representatives pay attention to the number of women when electing? This is because women were oppressed in the old society and were not valued. Now, although women's status has been improved, if attention is not paid, women will still not be easily elected. Of course, this is based on today's actual situation, and in ten years, it will certainly not be necessary to emphasize taking care of women. When deliberating on the election of district government committee members in the first district, many district representatives did not agree with proposing to take care of women's quotas, arguing that "women are not a class, nor are they a circle," "women are included in all aspects, and if they have the ability, they will naturally be elected." Chai Zemin, the Secretary of the Communist Party's Suburban District Committee, emphasized at the enlarged cadre meeting in the suburban districts that it is necessary to adhere to the principle of "mobilizing men and women together." This spirit was quickly implemented, so the women in the suburban areas were basically mobilized this time. The leading organs of the fifth district paid great attention to women being elected as government committee members. They believed that women can do a lot of work. The responsible cadres of the fifth district said: From the perspective of future development, women have great potential strength. Various organizations are becoming more and more sound, and more and more people are employed. The need for and role of women's participation in street work and government work is becoming more and more important, so women's work must be strengthened. Those who do not pay attention to women and do not pay attention to women's work have no foresight. The above shows that the breadth and depth of women's participation in politics is inseparable from the degree of leadership's attention.

    II. Several experiences of the Women's Federation in mobilizing women's participation in politics

    (1) Strive for the leadership's attention in many ways. Actively report women's situation to the leadership, provide specific materials to help the leadership understand women's contributions and achievements in various work, and actively put forward opinions on mobilizing women to participate in elections and on women being elected.

    (2) Report principled or more important issues in a timely manner and strive for the leadership's unified solution. For example, during the election of government committee members in the urban areas this time, there was a lot of controversy about the issue of taking care of women's quotas in some districts, and opinions were inconsistent. The District Women's Federation promptly reported it to the Municipal Women's Federation. The Municipal Women's Federation estimated that other districts would also have similar problems, and quickly reported it to the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Later, Mayor Peng Zhen made a report, and the thoughts of the districts became consistent.

    (3) The District Women's Federation should participate in the district's governance leadership institutions. This can understand the overall situation and make it easy to grasp; on the other hand, problems can be better solved through leadership institutions. For example, Shi Lei, the Chairman of the Women's Federation of the First District, introduced the situation of women at the District Consultative Committee, put forward the opinion that women's quotas should be taken care of, and criticized the feudal remnants of thought that belittle women, and finally won the victory.

    (4) Strive for the leadership to adopt concrete measures to ensure women's participation in politics under possible conditions. For example, when the suburbs were studying the democratic elections of villages and towns, the Municipal Women's Federation and the Suburban Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly studied it beforehand. When deploying work, the Secretary of the Suburban Committee specifically put forward the effort goals for the proportion of women representatives and government committee members (women accounted for 25% of the village representatives and 15% of the government committee members). The election results were close to the original goals.

    (5) Promote and cooperate with all parties to widely publicize the significance of women's participation in politics to women and the whole society. The main obstacles to women's participation in politics at present are the feudal remnants of thought that belittle and bind women. For example, some people think: "Women have short-sightedness and cannot do big things." "What can you do with children?" "This woman can do everything, but it's not suitable to be a village head." "If a wife has the ability, she can't be controlled." "The wife only cares about her own future and doesn't care about her husband and children." Some elderly people are afraid that "girls will learn badly when they go out." And so on. Women themselves also have a sense of inferiority, thinking: "I have never done big things, so I can't do it." "Housework and children are impossible." Therefore, in addition to generally carrying out democratic governance publicity, the Women's Federation should actively publicize to society and women in light of specific circumstances. When publicizing to society, it should be pointed out that the problem is not only that women account for half of the population, but that the problem is that the broad masses of women have participated in various social activities, and some have already held certain positions among the masses; the achievements and typical figures of women in production, study, resisting America and aiding Korea, public security, street sanitation, and other work should be publicized in a planned way. When publicizing to women, it should be emphasized that participating in political activities and government construction is related to women's liberation. Explain the social roots of women's own weaknesses and the ways to overcome them. In publicity, it is necessary to break the erroneous view that "women can't do anything" and establish the concept that women can do everything. After such publicity in various villages in the suburbs, the ideological problems of some people were solved. For example, before the election in Dongba Town, there was a general idea among women that "elect, anyway, there is nothing for women." After the publicity, it was very different, and they were full of energy, saying, "The handle of the knife is in the hands of our people, and women must fight for a share." As a result, women accounted for 33 out of the 103 representatives in the whole village. Women accounted for 4 out of the 15 government committee members.

    (6) Frequently and systematically train a large number of women activists to prepare talents to participate in government institutions. Women's participation in politics is not a surprise attack, and the problems cannot be solved by temporary publicity and deliberation. It is necessary to discover and train activists in daily work. The fact that four women were elected as government committee members in the fifth district this time is the result of the past frequent training of women activists in various aspects. However, because there were not enough qualified women candidates when deliberating on candidates among residents in the second, seventh, and eighth districts, no women were elected on the streets. This shows that although women have the opportunity to participate in politics, they will not succeed if they do not lay a good foundation themselves.

    (7) The Women's Federation should cooperate with all parties before and after the democratic governance movement to give women an extra push. In general leadership, the Women's Federation did not pay enough attention to the democratic governance movement in various districts this time, so some cadres disagreed with taking care of women and thought that women's election was just "decoration," and failed to coordinate with relevant parties to resolve it in a timely manner, which affected women's election in some places.

    In the process of governance, the Women's Federation can appropriately convene some meetings of women activists separately to understand the situation, strengthen women's confidence, and solve their problems. For example, during the stage of publicity and deliberation on the election of government committee members in the first district, the District Women's Federation convened an enlarged meeting of the executive committee and a symposium of female district representatives to collect the opinions of the masses, publicize the issue of women's participation in politics, and deliberate on the candidates for female government committee members. These meetings were very effective. After the movement, women should seize the opportunity to solve the problems left over from women's participation in politics. Help the women who have participated in government work in a timely manner to solve various difficulties and improve their confidence. Those who are slightly worse but have been elected should be trained in a planned way. For example, the Municipal Women's Federation held a reception for female government committee members and female village and town heads from various districts after this district election, which strengthened their confidence in participating in politics and exchanged work experience. Everyone who attended was very excited. We believe that such meetings can be held once every certain period of time. The Municipal and District Women's Federations should take helping female government committee members and female village, town, and street heads to do a good job as their regular work.

    北京市是怎样发动妇女参政的？
    一、情况
    八、九月间，北京市十六个郊区都召开了人民代表会议，代行了人民代表大会的职权，选举了区长和政府委员。九个城区选出政府委员一百三十一名，其中妇女二十一名，占总数百分之十六。七个郊区共选出政府委员九十一名，其中妇女委员十四名，占总数百分之十五·五。十六个区的政府委员中妇女共三十五名，包括妇联干部十四名，其他部门女干部三名，小学校长和教员五名，家庭劳动妇女五名，农妇八名，区长中有两名是妇女，一名是党员干部，连选连任，另一名是这次当选的家庭知识妇女。
    七、八两个月内，郊区一百七十一个行政村十个镇，十五个街都普选了人民代表，召开了村镇代表大会，选举了村、镇、街长和政府委员，加上今年夏季已实行民主建政的八十五个村，郊区的民主建政工作已全部完成。据十二区四十二个村的统计，选出人民代表一千八百四十七名，其中妇女四百六十三名，占总数百分之二十五。政府委员四百九十六名，其中妇女六十六名，占总数百分之十三强，全郊区共有女村、镇、街长二十一名，西坝河村正副村长都是女的。
    在这次民主建政运动中，妇女起了很大作用，郊区村选时，妇女积极地参加了选举，一般的选区妇女选民占二分之一至三分之二。妇女们都热烈发言，认真地选举自己的代表，当选代表的妇女就主动地搜集提案，提交各界人民代表大会，大会开过以后，女代表也都积极地传达和执行决议。当选的女村镇长，一般都能负起责任，带动群众作好抗美援朝和生产等工作，从而建立了威信。例如第十区东坝镇第一次人民代表会议决议发动群众捕虫，副镇长王兰英和政府委员张淑曼（都是妇女）即与所有委员和代表共同发动群众，并通过妇女代表会议发动妇女，当天即发动了群众一千二百余人，其中妇女占八九百人，两小时内捕虫四十余斤，坚持了七天，把蝗虫全部扑灭了。十五区麻峪村长可淑芳当选村长后，立即修订了村政府的爱国公约，并发动群众订公约，全村五百余户，现已有四百余户订立了爱国公约（原来只有三十七户订立），她又号召群众增产捐献，该村原认捐一千余万只交了五万多元，最近已交到二百余万元了。
    在这次民主建政运动中，有相当数量的妇女被选入政权领导机构，产生了很大的社会影响，特别是给了广大妇女群众以鼓舞。中共五区区委书记兼区长顾德对该区一个妇女当选副区长和其他三个妇女当选政府委员这一事实的估计是：“把整个民主建政推进一步，对街道工作和妇女工作有很大的鼓舞，因为选举的结果说明，只要全心全意为人民服务，获得人民的信任，不论男的女的，全可以当区长或当政府委员。”
    总起来说，妇女群众积极参加了这次民主建政运动，而被选到区、村政权领导机关的妇女，从数量上，她们一般是合乎需要与可能的，为什么有这样结果呢？主在原因有二：
    一方面是妇女本身的条件，经过许多运动，特别是轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝、镇压反革命等运动，广大妇女和男人一样，政治觉悟普遍提高了。参加了各种活动，从中涌现了大批积极分子，并被选举到各部门负责岗位，从而为这次民主建政运动中妇女的参加选举与当选准备了条件（基础）。去年城区选举区街代表时，很多妇女强调自己不能干，有的因为有“变天”思想，因而不愿当选，个别的还哭着吵着不愿干，今年的情形就完全不同了，这次区村进行民选时，一般妇女都是积极的。她们认识到祖国的可爱，了解了参加民主建政与妇女解放的关系，当选的都愿为大家办事，知道当代表当委员是光荣的。
    另方面，是领导上对妇女参加政治活动和政权工作的重视和支持。彭真市长向各区全体人民代表作有关选举问题的报告时曾特别指出妇女参政的必要。很明显的，在政府委员中，妇女有一定的数量，才能照顾到全面。代表们在选举时要注意到妇女的名额是为什么呢？这是因为妇女在旧社会是受压迫的，是不被人重视的，现在，妇女的地位虽已提高了，但是，如果不注意，妇女还是不容易当选的，当然，这是从今天的实际情况出发，十年以后，当然不需要强调照顾妇女了。一区在酝酿选举区政府委员时，很多区代表不赞成提出照顾妇女名额，理由是“妇女不是一个阶级，又不是一界”，“妇女包括在各方面，有本事，自然选得上。”中共郊区区委书记柴泽民在郊区扩大干部会上，强调指出要坚持“男女一齐发动”的方针，这样的精神很快地贯彻下去了，所以这次郊区的妇女基本上发动起来了。五区领导机关很注意妇女当选政府委员，他们认为妇女可以作很多工作。五区负责干部说：从发展前途看，妇女有很大的潜在力量。各种组织越来越健全，就业的人也越来越多，妇女参加街道工作和政权工作的需要和作用也就越来越大，因此必须加强妇女工作。不重视妇女和不注意妇女工作的，都是没有预见。以上说明妇女参政的广度和深度，和领导重视的程度是分不开的。
    二、妇联在发动妇女参政方面的几点经验
    （一）多方面争取领导方面的重视。主动向领导方面反映妇女的情况，提供具体材料帮助领导方面了解妇女在各种工作中的贡献与成绩，并主动提出发动妇女参加选举和关于妇女当选的意见。
    （二）发现原则性的或较重要的问题要及时反映，争取领导方面的统一解决。如这次市区选举政府委员时，有些区关于照顾妇女名额问题争论很厉害，意见不一致。区妇联及时反映到市妇联，市妇联估计其他区也会有类似问题，又很快地反映到中共北京市委。后来，彭真市长作了报告，各区的思想便一致了。
    （三）区妇联应参加区的建政领导机构。这一方面可以了解全面情况，便于掌握；另方面可以通过领导机构，更好地解决问题。如一区妇联主席石磊在区协商委员会上介绍了妇女的情况，提出应照顾妇女名额的意见，并批判了轻视妇女的封建残余思想，最后获得了胜利。
    （四）争取领导方面在可能条件下，采用具体办法保证妇女参政。如郊区在研究村镇民选时，市妇联与中共郊区委员会事前共同研究过，郊区委员会书记在布置工作时，具体提出了妇女代表与政府委员的比例的努力目标（妇女在村代表中占百分之二十五，政府委员占百分之十五）。选举结果，和原定目标是接近的。
    （五）推动与配合各方面，向妇女和全社会广泛宣传妇女参政的意义。目前妇女参政的主要阻碍是轻视妇女和束缚妇女的封建残余思想。例如：有些人认为：“娘儿们见识短，不能干大事。”“有孩子能干什么？”“这妇女什么都行，但当村长不合适。”“老婆有了本事，就管不了啦。”“老婆光顾自己前途，不管丈夫孩子了。”有些老年人则怕“女孩子出去会学坏了。”等等。就是妇女本身也有自卑感，认为：“自己没干过大事，不成。”“家务、孩子没办法。”因此，除了一般地进行民主建政宣传外，妇联要针对具体情况，主动向社会和妇女作宣传。向社会作宣传时，应指出，问题不仅在于妇女占人口半数，问题首先在于在广大妇女已参加了各种社会活动，并且有些已在群众中担任一定的职务；要有计划地宣传妇女在生产、学习、抗美援朝、治安保卫、街道卫生等工作中的成绩和典型人物。向妇女宣传时，要着重指出参加政治活动和政权建设与妇女解放的关系。说明妇女本身弱点的社会根源和克服的办法。要在宣传中打破“妇女一切不行”的错误观点，树立妇女一切可做的观念。郊区各村经过这样的宣传后，有些群众的思想问题就解决了。如东坝镇在选举前，妇女中普遍存在着“选吧，反正没有娘们的事”的思想。宣传后大不同了，劲也足了，都说：“刀把拿到咱人民手里了，妇女说什么也要争上一份。”结果全村一○三个代表中，妇女占了三十三名。十五个政府委员中，妇女占了四名。
    （六）经常有计划地大量培养妇女积极分子，准备参加政权机构的人材。妇女参政不是突击工作，不是临时的宣传酝酿可以解决问题的。必须在日常工作中发现和培养积极分子。五区这次选举能有四个妇女当选政府委员，就是以往从各方面经常培养妇女积极分子的结果。而二、七、八等区在居民中酝酿候选人时因为没有够条件的妇女人选，所以街道上就没选上妇女。这说明妇女虽有参政的机会，但是如果自己没有打好基础也是不成的。
    （七）妇联在民主建政运动的前后均要与各方面配合工作，对妇女加一把力。妇联总的领导上在这次各区民主建政运动之前，抓的不够紧，因此部分干部不同意照顾妇女和认为妇女当选也不过是“点缀”的思想，没能及时配合有关方面协商解决，因而在某些地方使妇女当选受了些影响。
    在建政过程中，妇联可以适当单独地召开一些妇女积极分子会，了解情况，坚定妇女信心，解决她们的问题。如一区宣传酝酿选举政府委员的阶段，区妇联召开了执委扩大会和女区代表座谈会，搜集了群众的意见，宣传了妇女参政问题，酝酿了女政府委员的人选，这些会收效都很好。在运动结束后，妇女更要抓紧解决妇女在参政中遗留的问题。对已参加政权工作的妇女要及时地帮助她们解决各方面的困难，提高她们的信心。对稍差但已当选者更应有计划地培养。如市妇联在这次区选后，举行了各区女政府委员、各女村镇长的招待会，坚定了她们参政的信心并交流了工作经验。到会的都很兴奋。我们认为，这样的会议可以隔一定的时期召开一次。市、区妇联应以帮助女政府委员和女村、镇、街长做好工作，作为自己的经常工作。
