To the Editor:

The emancipated farmers in the Xuancheng Special District of Southern Anhui, after the land reform, under the leadership of governments at all levels, have overcome various natural disasters and achieved a considerable harvest. Many areas have now completed harvesting, and farmers are preparing to pay patriotic public grain. However, there are still some areas, such as Xinqiao Village in the seventh district of Guangde, that deliberately exaggerate the disaster situation in an attempt to reduce or evade burdens. Gan Chengkuan, the director of the village farmers' association, has 6.5 mu of land, with a normal annual yield assessed at 330 jin per mu. Although it suffered some disaster this year, it can actually yield 350 jin per mu, exceeding the normal annual yield; however, he reported an 80% disaster. Dai Xuefa, a village cadre, has 13.1 mu of land, and this year's harvest is equivalent to the normal annual yield, but he also reported a 40% disaster. Peng Yongxing, the head of the Jiuli neighborhood group, who was not affected by the disaster, also reported an 80% disaster for his 6 mu of land. Because village cadres took the lead in making false reports, the masses followed suit with large-scale false reports. In total, out of 3,631 mu of land in the village, 2,593 mu were reported as disaster-stricken. In early September, when the special commissioner's work team went to the village to inspect production work, they found that only 1,219 mu of land in the village were actually affected by the disaster, with false reporting exceeding 100%.

The above situation illustrates the following problems: 1. The normal annual yield is not assessed accurately. For example, the land of village cadres Gan Chengkuan and Dai Xuefa still exceeded or was equivalent to the normal annual yield after being affected by the disaster this year. 2. The bureaucratic work style of the district cadres is serious. The seventh district is only three or four li away from Xinqiao Village. When the village reported the disaster, the district office did not seriously go down to inspect it. Regarding the above points, it is hoped that the relevant authorities will check and correct them.

### 皖南广德县新桥村不应浮报灾情逃避负担

    皖南广德县新桥村不应浮报灾情逃避负担编辑同志：
    皖南宣城专区土地改革后的翻身农民，在各级人民政府的领导下，战胜了各种自然灾害，赢得一个相当的丰收。目前不少地区已收割完毕，农民正准备交纳爱国公粮。但是还有个别地区，如广德七区新桥村，却故意夸大灾情，企图减轻或逃避负担。该村农会主任甘成宽的六亩五分田，常年产量每亩评定是三百三十市斤，今年虽受了一些灾，实际每亩还可收三百五十市斤，已超过了常年产量；但他却报了八成灾。村干部戴学发有十三亩一分田，今年的收成已相当于常年产量，也报了四成灾。没有受灾的九闾组长彭永兴，有六亩田也报了八成灾。由于村干部带头浮报，群众也就跟着大量浮报。总计全村三千六百三十一亩田，就报了二千五百九十三亩灾田。九月上旬专署工作组，到该村检查生产工作时，发现该村实际受灾田仅有一千二百十九亩，浮报达一倍以上。
    以上情况，说明以下几个问题：一、常年产量评得不真实。如村干部甘成宽、戴学发的田，今年受灾后，实产量仍然超过或相当于常年产量。二、区干部的官僚主义作风严重。七区距离新桥村只有三、四里路，村里报了灾，区公所却没有认真的下去检查过。以上各点，希有关当局检查纠正。
