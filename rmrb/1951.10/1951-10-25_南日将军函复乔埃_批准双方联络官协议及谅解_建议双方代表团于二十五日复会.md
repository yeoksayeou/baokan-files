Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 24th: General Nam Il's reply to General Joye on the 23rd reads in full as follows:

To Vice Admiral Joye, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

I have received your letter of October 22nd and the four copies of the agreement you signed (two each in English and Korean). It has been two months since the August 22nd incident forced the suspension of the armistice negotiations. Now, in order to prevent the recurrence of events in the past two months where your side continuously violated the agreement, thus obstructing the progress of the armistice negotiations, under the strict provisions of the new agreement and understanding, the Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation has been authorized to approve the "Agreement between the Liaison Officers of both sides on the Resumption of Meetings of the Delegations of both sides."

I have signed the four copies of the agreement between the liaison officers of both sides that you signed and attached to your letter of October 22nd. I am now enclosing two copies of the agreement that I have signed (one each in Korean and English) and a Chinese copy. I also formally agree to abide by the five common understandings reached between the liaison officers of both sides. These understandings are also those that you expressed agreement to abide by in your letter of October 22nd.

Since September 19th, our commanders have repeatedly suggested a swift resumption of the meetings of both delegations. In order to avoid any further delays in the meetings of both delegations, I suggest that both delegations resume their meeting at 11:00 AM on October 25th.

    【新华社开城二十四日电】南日将军二十三日给乔埃将军的回信，全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃海军中将：
    你十月二十二日的来信及附来你已经签署的协议四份（英文朝文各二份）业已收到。自从八月二十二日事件迫使停战谈判停顿以来，已经两个月了。现在为了使过去两个月中你方连续违反协议的事件能够在新的协议和谅解的严格规定之下不致再行发生来阻挠停战谈判的进行，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表已受权批准“双方联络官间关于双方代表团复会事宜的协议”。
    我已在你于十月二十二日来信中附来的你已签署的四份双方联络官协议上签字。兹附交已经我签署的协议两份（朝文及英文各一份）及中文副本一份。我也正式同意遵守双方联络官间所达成的五项共同谅解。这些谅解也是你在十月二十二日来信中所表示同意遵守的。
    自从九月十九日以来，我方司令官就已经一再建议迅速恢复双方代表团会议，为使双方代表团会议不再有所迟延，我建议双方代表团在十月二十五日上午十一时复会。
