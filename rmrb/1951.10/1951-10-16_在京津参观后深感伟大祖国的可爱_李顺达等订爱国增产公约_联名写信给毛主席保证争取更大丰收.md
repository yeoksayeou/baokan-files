Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Agricultural labor model representatives Li Shunda, Han En, Qu Yaoli, and 44 others, who participated in the National Day celebrations in the capital, visited factories, state-owned farms, and the North China Region Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition in Beijing and Tianjin. They deeply felt the lovableness of the great motherland. At the same time, they saw the prospects of agricultural collectivization in China and learned many advanced agricultural production experiences. Therefore, they were all filled with confidence and wanted to further improve agricultural production in 1952. To this end, after discussion on the 13th of this month, they established a joint patriotic production increase pact. They also jointly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to earnestly implement the patriotic production increase pact and strive for an even greater harvest next year. The full text of the patriotic production increase pact is as follows:

This time, we came to the capital to participate in the National Day celebrations, met Chairman Mao, and saw the army, navy, and air force troops participating in the National Day celebrations and many new weapons. We deeply felt Chairman Mao's care for us, the strength of the motherland's defense forces, and the lovableness of our great motherland. We felt indescribably happy.

We visited state-owned farms and factories in Beijing, and then visited the North China Region Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition and textile factories in Tianjin. Visiting the exhibition enabled us to learn many advanced farming techniques, methods for improving soil, experiences in preventing and controlling pests and diseases, and methods for using new farm implements; we learned what industrial raw materials are and what we should plant more of. Visiting the factories, we saw the creativity of the working class, collectivized industrial production, and the workers' support for the peasants, which made us more clearly aware of the greatness of the working class, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthened the importance of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas. Visiting the machine farming of state-owned farms concretely showed us the prospects of agricultural collectivization in China and the direction of our efforts. Seeing these things increased our confidence to further improve production in 1952.

Therefore, in addition to guaranteeing that we will publicize what we have seen and heard to the local peasants after returning home, we have also decided, after discussion, to formulate these eight patriotic production increase pacts:

	One, continue to deeply develop the rural Resist America, Aid Korea movement, closely integrate patriotism and production, strive to increase production, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and assist the government in doing a good job of supporting the army and substitute farming.

	Two, ensure the completion of this year's autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting (or winter plowing, winter planting), carry out winter production, and turn winter idleness into winter busyness.

	Three, ensure that we ourselves make and lead mutual aid teams and other peasants to formulate specific production plans for next year, actively participate in the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement, ensure further improvement of production, and supply the state with more grain, cotton, and other industrial raw materials; in pastoral areas, increase the breeding of livestock.

	Four, consolidate and improve our own mutual aid organizations, publicize their benefits, introduce the experiences of mutual aid teams in various places, and guide and help more peasants to organize.

	Five, accept and promote scientific and technological knowledge and the advanced bumper harvest experiences of peasants in various places to improve production technology; establish and improve technical research committees or groups within villages and mutual aid teams; and give priority to the use of new farm implements and pesticide applicators.

	Six, actively participate in and mobilize peasants to build water conservancy projects, prevent and control pests and diseases, and carry out other construction work to overcome various natural disasters.

	Seven, achieve deep plowing, multiple harrowing, diligent weeding, selection of improved seeds, increased fertilization, and soil improvement, and strive to turn sloping fields into terraced fields to increase the yield per unit area.

	Eight, closely contact the masses, humbly learn from the masses, accept leadership, ensure that we are not arrogant or complacent, actively participate in learning, improve our political, cultural, and technical level, and always maintain the glorious title of labor model.

    【新华社十五日讯】参加首都国庆节典礼的农业劳动模范代表李顺达、韩恩、曲耀离等四十四人，先后在北京、天津参观了工厂、国营农场和华北区城乡物资交流展览会后，深深感到伟大祖国的可爱，同时，他们又看到了中国农业集体化的远景，学习到许多农业生产的先进经验。因此，他们都充满了信心，要把一九五二年的农业生产更提高一步。为此，他们在本月十三日经过讨论后，订立了共同的爱国增产公约。他们并联名写信给毛主席，保证认真执行爱国增产公约，争取明年更大的丰收。爱国增产公约的全文如下：
    我们这次到首都参加国庆典礼，见到了毛主席，见到了参加国庆典礼的陆、空、海军部队和许多新式武器。我们深深感到毛主席对我们的关怀、祖国国防力量的强大和我们伟大祖国的可爱。我们心里真有说不出的高兴。
    我们在北京参观了国营农场和工厂，又到天津参观了华北区城乡物资交流展览会和纺织厂。参观了展览会使我们学习到了许多先进的耕作技术、改良土壤的办法、防治病虫害的经验和新式农具使用的方法；知道了什么是工业原料、我们应该多种些什么东西。参观了工厂，我们看到了工人阶级的创造性、集体化的工业生产和工人给农民的支援，使我们更清楚地认识了工人阶级的伟大，巩固工农联盟和加强城乡互助的重要。参观了国营农场的机器耕作，就使我们具体地看到了中国农业集体化的远景和我们努力的方向。我们看到了这些东西，就增加了我们的信心，要把一九五二年的生产更提高一步。
    因此，我们除了保证在回家以后，要把我们见到的和听到的，向当地的农民宣传以外，我们又在讨论后，决定订出这八项爱国增产公约：
    一、继续深入开展农村抗美援朝运动，把爱国和生产密切结合起来，努力增产，支援中国人民志愿军，并协助政府作好拥军、代耕工作。
    二、保证作好今年的秋收、秋耕、秋种（或冬耕、冬种）工作，开展冬季生产，变冬闲为冬忙。
    三、自己做到并带动互助组及其他农民制订明年的具体生产计划，积极参加爱国主义丰产竞赛运动，保证进一步提高生产，供给国家更多的粮食、棉花和其他工业原料；在畜牧区要多增殖牲畜。
    四、巩固和提高自己的互助组织，宣传它的好处，介绍各地互助组的经验，引导与帮助更多的农民组织起来。
    五、接受并推广科学技术和各地农民先进的丰产经验，提高生产技术；建立与健全村内和互助组内的技术研究委员会或小组；并尽先使用新式农具及药械。
    六、积极参加和发动农民兴修水利，防治病虫害及进行其他各项建设工作，战胜各种自然灾害。
    七、作到深耕、多耙、勤锄、选用良种、增施肥料、改良土壤，尽力把坡田修成梯田，增加单位面积的产量。
    八、密切联系群众，虚心向群众学习，接受领导，保证不骄傲自满，积极参加学习，提高政治、文化和技术水平，永远保持劳动模范的光荣称号。
