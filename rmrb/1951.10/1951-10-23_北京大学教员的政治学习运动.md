    Political Study Movement of Peking University Faculty
    Ma Yinchu
    I took office as President of Peking University on June 1 this year. Peking University is my old home (I taught at Peking University from 1914 to 1927). After arriving at my old home and seeing the Red Building, I had an indescribable feeling in my heart. Peking University is, after all, Peking University. The students and most of the faculty have made great progress in their thinking. Everyone is willing to make Peking University continue to progress and become a people's university of the new China.
    However, Peking University is not without its shortcomings. Freedom and laxity are our shortcomings. This is also related to the dispersed residences of our faculty and staff, but this kind of free and lax style has a more important ideological root that must be overcome. The most obvious of these is that the ideological level and sense of ownership of the staff are not high. Therefore, we launched a study program for the staff for more than 40 days during the summer vacation, which was very effective. After the start of the semester, work efficiency has improved a lot. We have gained some experience from this, and the importance of learning has also been clarified among colleagues.
    The 53-year history of Peking University is inseparable from the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. Peking University played an extremely important role in the May Fourth Movement. The earliest Marxist theory research society in China was established at Peking University. Mr. Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party and an advanced communist, was the director of the Peking University Library at the time. He led many young people here to study and disseminate Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, also studied Marxism-Leninism at Peking University at that time and started his revolutionary work. The relationship between Peking University and the history of the Chinese revolution is so close that it is rare in the history of universities in the world. This is the greatest glory and pride of Peking University.
    The teachers of Peking University, maintaining such a glorious revolutionary tradition, are naturally willing to accept all new ideas. Therefore, it is possible to transform an old-style university into a new people's university. For more than two years since liberation, we have been working hard in a new direction. For this purpose, we must thoroughly adjust departments, reform curricula, and improve teaching content and methods according to the needs of the country; and to achieve this goal, a key is to enable all teachers and students to truly recognize the necessity of reform, consciously and voluntarily carry out ideological remolding, so that we can better serve the people. Although Peking University has also carried out some reform work in the past two years, these achievements are still far from our ideals in terms of national needs and our tasks. Therefore, we decided to launch a planned and systematic study movement among all faculty and staff. We must also respond to Premier Zhou's call to strengthen ideological remolding, match our professional level, and undertake new tasks.
    The goal of our study this time is to promote the transformation of the school through ideological remolding. The method of study is to listen to reports, study documents, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that we can arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. However, how should we arm ourselves?
    (1) The purpose of New Democracy education is to cultivate a large number of excellent cadres for our country who are both talented and virtuous, physically fit, and have a high degree of communist spirit. In other words, the responsibility of teachers is to cultivate a large number of revolutionary youths for the country. It is impossible to cultivate a large number of revolutionary cadres without having revolutionary ideas themselves. This is one reason why political study for teachers is important.
    (2) If the political level of teachers is gradually improved to match their professional level, then they will certainly make greater contributions to the country's various constructions in the future. Because in this way, it is possible to change "starting from a personal standpoint" to "starting from the people's standpoint" and completely change the face of China.
    (3) Ideological remolding can not only cultivate a large number of revolutionary cadres, but also strengthen the unity of teachers. The Peking University study movement was launched by the teachers themselves. It must be welcomed for Teacher A to help transform the thinking of Teacher B in the spirit of mutual assistance. If there is a consistent understanding in thinking, things can be pushed forward even further.
    (4) Although higher education has made a lot of progress in the past two years, the improvement of higher education is not enough in terms of the people's demands on us. Various construction works are being carried out, and one of the determining factors in construction work is people, is cadres, but cadres are generally lacking at present. The country is in need of a large number of construction talents. The task of higher education is originally to cultivate high-level technical talents and cultivate the main cadres for national construction, but can today's higher education complete the task assigned to it by the country and the people? First of all, the country needs so many high-level technical cadres, but the talents that higher education can cultivate are so few. Although there are objective conditions that limit this, is our subjective effort enough? For example, if we can overcome departmentalism, make reasonable allocation and adjustment of existing manpower and material resources, sacrifice individual freedom, and respect collective interests, we can avoid waste and give play to potential strength, and we can certainly use a small number of teachers to cultivate a large number of talents for the country.
    (5) What the country needs are cadres who not only master technology and science, but also stand firm and truly serve the people. The educational policy of higher education is to integrate theory with practice, but can the talents trained by today's higher education master science and technology that is related to China's actual situation? I know that there are still individual professors in certain universities who are still lecturing on American family law and capitalist banking systems! Although these are very few special examples, some university graduates have indeed told me that the set of theories learned in school is still quite divorced from the actual situation outside, and it is often difficult to connect with it when going out to work. Students in school often reflect opinions to the school, proposing that the content of a certain course needs to be reformed, and that there are some problems with a certain teacher's teaching. Some work departments directly put forward that the talents trained by today's universities are still quite far from their ideals. In general, from the perspective of national construction and the needs of the people, today's higher education still needs to be further and thoroughly transformed.
    We recognized the importance of learning and put forward the request for learning, which was approved by the Central People's Government. In order to organize colleagues from Peking, Tianjin and other universities to participate, and to avoid the difficulty of leaders taking turns to give reports to various universities, the Central Ministry of Education decided to expand the scope of this study. On the afternoon of September 29th, Premier Zhou was invited to give the first report. Professors and colleagues from universities in Beijing and Tianjin were also invited to participate in listening to the report. Premier Zhou spoke for five hours, but the listeners did not feel tired. Premier Zhou's report was divided into seven issues:
    (1) Standpoint (2) Attitude (3) Serving Whom (4) Ideological Issues (5) Knowledge Issues (6) Democracy Issues (7) Criticism and Self-Criticism. The more in-depth the questions, the more touching they were. When he talked about the last section, Premier Zhou frankly stated his social relations in the spirit of self-criticism, and everyone who listened was moved. In my opinion, this is the most effective way to lead intellectuals to transform their thinking. This not only inspires the intellectuals' desire to learn, but also consolidates the learners' confidence, improves the learners' mood, and promotes the process of ideological remolding.
    After Premier Zhou's report, there were also reports from several government leaders, all arranged and led by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. I hope that our colleagues in universities across the country will be determined to further transform ourselves in this study, so that we can truly become revolutionary teachers of the new Chinese people.

    北京大学教员的政治学习运动
    马寅初
    我今年六月一日就北京大学校长职。北京大学是我的娘家（一九一四年至一九二七年曾在北京大学教书）。到了娘家之后见了红楼，心中就有一种说不出的感想，北京大学到底是北京大学，学生与大部分教员思想都很有进步，大家都愿意使北京大学不断进步，成为新中国人民的大学。
    但是，北京大学不是没有缺点的，自由散漫就是我们的缺点。这和我们的教职员工居所分散也有关系，但这种自由散漫的作风却有更重要的思想根源，必须加以克服。其中最明显的是职员思想水准和主人翁的自觉都不高，因此在暑假中发动职员学习了四十余天，成效甚好，开学后工作效率提高不少。从这里取得了一些经验，在同仁中也明确了学习的重要性。
    北京大学五十三年的历史是与中国人民的革命事业分不开的。北京大学在五四运动中占了极重要的地位，中国最早的一个马克思学说研究会是在北京大学成立起来的。中国先进的共产主义者中国共产党创立人之一李大钊先生当时是北京大学图书馆主任，他领导了许多青年在这里研究和传播马克思列宁主义。中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席当时亦在北京大学研究马克思列宁主义，开始革命工作。北京大学和中国革命历史的关系如此密切，不但在中国，就是在世界各大学的历史上也是少有的。这是北京大学最大的光荣和骄傲。
    北京大学教师们保持了这样一个光荣的革命传统，自然愿意接受一切新的思潮。故能将一所旧型的大学改造成为新的人民的大学。解放后二年多来我们一直向新的方向努力。为了这个目的，必须按照国家的需要，彻底的调整院系，改革课程，改进教学内容与教学方法；而要达到这一目的，一个最主要的关键，就是要使全校师生都能真正认识到改革的必要，自觉自愿地进行了思想改造，使我们自己能更好地为人民服务。这二年多来北京大学虽然也进行了一些改革工作，但对于国家的需要和我们的任务来说，这些成绩离开我们的理想还远得很。因此我们决定在全校教职员中间发动一次有计划有系统的学习运动。还要响应周总理的号召来加强思想改造，配合业务水平，来负担新的任务。
    我们这一次学习的目标，就是希望经过思想改造来推进学校的改造。学习的方法，是听报告、学文件，展开批评与自我批评，使我们能够以马列主义和毛泽东思想来武装自己。然而，我们应该怎样来武装自己呢？
    （一）新民主主义教育的目的是为我们的国家培养出大批的才德兼备、体魄健全、具有高度共产主义精神的优良干部。换言之，教员的责任就是要为国家培养出大批的革命青年。未有自己没有革命思想而能培养出大批革命干部的。教员政治学习之所以重要这是一个理由。
    （二）若把教员的政治水准逐渐提高以与他们的业务水准相配合，则此后对于国家的种种建设，必有更大的贡献。因为如此方可使“从个人立场出发”，一变而为“从人民立场出发”，把中国的面貌完全改观。
    （三）思想改造不仅可以培养出大批的革命干部，而且也可以加强教员们的团结。北京大学学习运动是教员们自己发动的，甲教员本互助的精神来帮助改造乙教员的思想一定是受欢迎的。思想上有一致的见解，做起事来，就能更推动一步。
    （四）高等教育在这两年多来虽然也有不少进步，但就人民对我们的要求来说，高等学校的改进是嫌不够的。各项建设工作正在开展，建设工作的决定因素之一是人，是干部，而目前干部却普遍缺乏。国家正需要大量建设人才，高等学校的任务原是培养高级技术人才，培养国家建设的主要干部，但今天的高等学校能否完成国家人民所交给的这个任务呢？首先是国家建设所需要的高级技术干部是这样多，而高等学校所能培养出来的人才却那么少，这里虽然有客观条件的限制，但主观努力是否已够？譬如说，如果我们能克服本位主义思想，将现有的人力物力作合理的配备和调整，牺牲个人自由，尊重集体利益，可以避免浪费，发挥潜在力量，一定可以用少数教师为国家培养出大批的人才。
    （五）国家需要的是既掌握技术、掌握科学，又能站稳立场，真正能为人民服务的干部。高等学校的教育方针是理论联系实际，但今天高等学校训练出来的人才就能掌握与中国实际情况相联系的科学技术吗？我知道某某等大学还有个别的教授到今天还在讲美国的亲属法和资本主义的银行制度呢！这虽是极少数特殊的例子，但确有一些大学毕业生回来告诉我：学校里学到的一套理论与外面实际情况还是有许多脱节，出去工作时往往会觉得联系不上。在校学生更常常向学校反映意见，提出某门课程的内容需要改革，某位先生的教学有些问题。若干工作部门直接就提出来：今天大学培养出来的人才离他们的理想还相当遥远。总起来说，从国家建设和人民的需要来看，今天的高等学校还需要进一步彻底的改造。
    我们认定了学习的重要，并且提出了学习的请求，得到了中央人民政府的同意。中央教育部为了组织北京天津其他各高等学校的同仁参加，并为了避免首长轮流到各大学作报告的困难，决定扩大这次学习的范围。在九月二十九日下午请周总理作了第一次的报告。并请北京天津各大学教授同仁共同参加听报告。周总理讲了五小时之久，时间虽长而听者不觉得疲倦。周总理的报告分作七个问题来讲，即：
    （一）立场（二）态度（三）为谁服务（四）思想问题（五）知识问题（六）民主问题（七）批评与自我批评。问题愈深入，愈动人听闻，讲到最后一段时，周总理以自我批评的精神坦白地说出自己的社会关系，听者莫不感动。以这样的办法来领导知识分子改造思想，在我看来是最有效的。这不仅启发了知识分子学习的要求，而且巩固了学习者的信心，提高了学习者的情绪，推进了思想改造的过程。
    在周总理报告后，还有若干位政府首长的报告，统由中央人民政府教育部布置与领导学习。我希望我们全国大学同仁下定决心在这次学习中进一步改造自己，使我们真正能够成为新中国人民革命的教师。
