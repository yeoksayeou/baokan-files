    To Fully Supply the Needs of the People Nationwide
    Shanghai Public and Private Cotton Mills Work Overtime
    As cotton purchased from various parts of the country is successively transported to Shanghai, and with the support of Soviet cotton, fifty-three public and private cotton textile factories in the city have started working overtime. From the 1st of this month, the factories have increased their operating schedule from eight shifts per week since July 23rd to ten shifts per week, and it has been decided to further increase it to twelve shifts per week in the second half of the month. Generally, the time when cotton from various places arrives in Shanghai is about half a month earlier than last year. The Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nanhui County, Sunan District, which is very close to Shanghai, was the first to send the first batch of purchased cotton to Shanghai on September 3rd. In the past, it took twenty-two days for cotton from the Hede Cotton Reclamation Area in Yancheng Prefecture, northern Jiangsu, to be transported to Shanghai; this time it has been shortened to only seven days. Since September, the amount of cotton transported to Shanghai from East China, North China, and Central and Southern China has been increasing day by day. On October 8th alone, more than 25,000 dan (unit of weight) of cotton were transported to Shanghai. While cotton from various places was being transported to Shanghai, a batch of Soviet cotton also arrived in Shanghai on October 6th. The workers and people from all walks of life in Shanghai were very grateful for the internationalist assistance of the great Soviet Union after hearing this news. While excitedly spinning the cotton shipped from the Soviet Union, the workers of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory expressed that they must pay more attention to saving cotton and produce more and better yarn and cloth to supply the needs of the people nationwide.

    充分供应全国人民的需要
    上海公私棉纺织厂加班生产
    由于国内各地收购的棉花陆续运到上海，同时又获得苏联棉花的支援，全市已有五十三家公私营棉纺织工厂开始加班生产。本月一日起，各厂已从七月二十三日以来的每周开工八班增加到每周十班，并决定在下半月起再增加到每周十二班。今年各地棉花运到上海的时间，一般都比去年提早半个月左右。距离上海很近的苏南区南汇县大团供销合作社在九月三日就把第一批收购的棉花最先送到上海。过去苏北盐城专区合德棉垦区的棉花运到上海要二十二天，这次已缩短到只需七天。自九月份以来，华东区和华北、中南等地区运到上海的棉花，数量与日俱增。十月八日一天内运到上海的棉花就有二万五千多市担。在各地棉花陆续运往上海的同时，苏联也有一批棉花在十月六日运到上海。上海工人和各界人民听到这一消息后，十分感激伟大的苏联盟邦的国际主义援助。国营上海第一棉纺织厂的工人们一面兴奋地纺着苏联运来的棉花，一面表示一定要更加注意节约用棉，生产更多更好的纱布来供应全国人民的需要。
