    Accepting the Newspaper's Criticism of Wood Waste
    Hunan Forestry Bureau Reviews Purely Profit-Driven Viewpoint
    After reading the People's Daily criticisms of Hunan's forestry work on August 19th and 22nd, we immediately began reviewing the Bureau's work and plan to organize the Bureau's cadres for study in order to systematically conduct in-depth inspections and educate cadres. The publication of criticisms in the People's Daily on August 30th and September 2nd further increased our attention to this matter.

    Indeed, some of the shortcomings pointed out by the People's Daily exist in our work. We believe that the main reasons for these shortcomings are: (1) Low political awareness; insufficient understanding of the central government's policy of unified logging and unified management in forestry work. We only saw the chaotic situation of the Hunan timber market before the establishment of the Forestry Bureau, and felt the need for good unified management. Without fully estimating our own strength and objective circumstances, we adopted a reckless and all-encompassing approach; we did not know how to organize relevant forces to carry out the work, resulting in losses. (2) The summary of the National Forestry Conference proposed that the logging work of forestry agencies should strive towards enterprise management. We did not fully understand the spirit of the central government's instructions. As a result, we only emphasized the enterprise management aspect and lacked sufficient understanding of how to realize the enterprise management policy while taking into account the overall interests and the interests of the masses. Therefore, there was a mentality of wanting to make money and fearing losses, which led to some practices in certain places that did not take into account the overall interests. For example, if we delivered the goods to the Ministry of Fuel Industry according to the contract, we could make money. If we were to meet the Ministry of Fuel Industry's requirements beyond the contract and deliver the goods at the station, we might not make any money, or even lose money; in addition, the Ministry's inspection standards were very strict, and if the inspection failed, the freight would be wasted and the loss would be even greater. Therefore, we emphasized that the contract should be executed according to the contract, which showed that we only proceeded from narrow local interests and did not focus on the needs of national construction. (3) The Forestry Bureau was only established in December last year, and the local forestry offices were established even later, some as late as March this year. Therefore, the vast majority of cadres were not familiar with the business, the Bureau's system was not sound, and the work was not on track. For example, the contract with the Ministry of Fuel Industry did not specify the specific delivery location; because the accounting system was not sound, there was no correct average cost, and the price of pit props was only set at 360,000 yuan per cubic meter. (4) The leading cadres of the Forestry Bureau did not understand the situation below in a timely manner, and did not provide enough help to the cadres below. They could not promptly correct the mandatory orders of some cadres who did not rely on the masses, resulting in phenomena that violated the interests of the masses, such as cutting down the trees of middle and poor peasants, and not paying the mountain prices in a timely manner.

    After the review, we have proposed some corrective measures: In the future, the mountain prices should be agreed upon by convening the farmers' association and relevant responsible persons for consultation. Those who have not paid enough in the past will be reissued and issued in a timely manner. Regarding the pit props of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, we have decided that regardless of how the original contract was signed, and regardless of the cost of freight, we will first transport them all to Dongjiang and Dong Station.

    The criticism of the People's Daily has aroused the attention of all cadres of the Bureau, especially the responsible cadres, and made us realize the seriousness of this issue politically and ideologically, which is of great educational significance to us. We should strengthen the overall concept and should not only take care of local interests. In particular, forestry work should be based on the development of forestry, and should not be based on a purely profit-driven perspective.

    接受本报关于浪费木材的批评
    湖南林业局检讨单纯营利观点
    我们读了人民日报八月十九日及二十二日关于湖南林业工作的批评后，即开始检讨本局工作，并拟组织本局干部，进行学习，以便能有系统地进行深入检查，教育干部。人民日报八月三十日及九月二日批评发表后，更提起了我们对这事的重视。
    在我们的工作中，的确存在着某些如人民日报所提出的缺点。我们认为产生这些缺点的主要原因是：（一）政治水平低，在林业工作中对中央提出的统一采伐统一经营的方针认识不够，只看见林业局成立以前湖南木材市场的混乱情况，觉得需要很好的统一管理，而未充分估计自己的力量及客观情况，就采取猛冲猛打，自己包揽起来的方式；不知道组织有关力量开展工作，致使工作遭受损失。（二）全国林业会议总结中曾提出林业机关的采伐工作应向企业化方向努力。我们对中央指示精神体会不够，结果只强调了企业化的一面，对如何在照顾整体利益及群众利益的原则下，实现企业化方针，则认识不足，因此存在着想赚钱怕赔本的想法，这就使得某些地方发生了一些不照顾整体利益的作法。如对中央燃料工业部的定货，若按合同规定交货，我们可以赚钱，若要满足中央燃料工业部合同以外的要求，在车站交货，可能会无钱可赚，甚至要赔本；再加上该部验货标准很严，若验不合格，则运费白花，损失更大。因此我们强调要按合同执行，这就表现了只从狭隘的局部利益出发，未从国家建设的需要上着眼。（三）林业局于去年十二月才成立，各地林业所则成立更晚，有的直到今年三月才成立。因此绝大多数干部对业务不熟悉，局内制度不健全，工作未上轨道。如与中央燃料工业部定的合同，未注明具体交货地点；因为会计制度不健全，一直没有正确的平均成本，坑木调拨价只定为三十六万元一立方公尺。（四）林业局领导干部对下面情况了解不及时，对下面干部帮助不够，不能及时纠正部分干部强迫命令不依靠群众的作法，致发生砍伐中、贫农的树，山价发放不及时等违背群众利益的现象。
    经过检讨后，我们已提出一些改正的办法：今后山价应一律采取召集农会及有关方面负责人会商方式协定。以前没有发足的，一律补发并及时发出。中央燃料工业部的坑木，我们已决定不管原来合同是怎样订的，也不计较运费的高低，先一齐运到东江和东站。    人民日报的批评，引起了本局全体干部，特别是负责干部的注意，使我们从政治上、思想上认识了这一问题的严重性，对我们教育意义很大。我们应加强整体观念，不应只顾局部利益。尤其林业工作应以发展林业为前提，不应单纯从利润观点着眼。
