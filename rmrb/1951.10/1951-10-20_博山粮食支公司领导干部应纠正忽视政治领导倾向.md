    Leading Cadres of Boshan Grain Branch Company Should Correct the Tendency to Neglect Political Leadership

    To the Editor:
    Since the People's Daily published the circular from the CCP Pingyuan Xinxiang District Committee on June 8th, opposing the tendency to disregard politics, this issue has attracted serious attention in various regions. However, some leading comrades of certain organizations still turn a blind eye and a deaf ear; some leading comrades of certain departments, although verbally admitting that they also have this bias in their leadership, have not made any practical corrections, as if they are overwhelmed by work. This shows how dull their political sense has become. Regarding this situation, I can take our company as an example to illustrate.

    Our company is engaged in grain economic work. Leading cadres have a simple task-oriented view, neglecting political and ideological leadership. For example, last year's rectification movement was overwhelmed by work tasks and did not actually play a significant role. This year's patriotic pact movement in February was also not led deeply and effectively by the leading cadres of our company, resulting in formalism. The leadership has always not valued political study, so the study is not conducted under leadership. It is just following the arrangements of the higher authorities without purpose, not starting from researching and analyzing the ideological situation of comrades, and then improving the ideological understanding of cadres through document study in a purposeful and planned manner. In particular, the leading cadres themselves often do not participate in political study, even the recent Party history study is no exception, always thinking it is the same old stuff. Not many people in our company from top to bottom read the newspaper, and they do not understand or understand very little about the current domestic and international political situation. They generally believe that reading newspapers does not solve work problems, and they can do the work well without reading newspapers, or they emphasize "too busy to read." Not only that, but they do not take a positive attitude towards political activities, such as listening to reports from the Municipal Party Committee and participating in mass rallies, but ideologically think of them as "extra burdens," "okay when work is idle, but now too busy to handle." Our company now has a total of seventy comrades, but there are no full-time personnel cadres. Ideological education within the Party and the Youth League is not done well enough, and organizational life is not frequent; even when meetings are held, they are neither prepared nor have lively content. Some Youth League comrades reflect: "The last group meeting was self-criticism and mutual criticism; this time it is also self-criticism, saying the same few sentences over and over again, without solving practical problems." The concentrated reflection of the above shortcomings is: the general comrades have a task-oriented view in their work, lack a conscious spirit of studying and striving for the revolutionary cause; resulting in a lack of vitality in their work, and their business level improves very slowly. These are all the results of the work not being built on the foundation of political consciousness, and the evil consequences caused by the tendency of leading cadres to disregard politics.

    We have studied the circular of the Xinxiang District Committee published in the People's Daily. The leadership has also realized that there are similar problems in our unit, but they have not corrected them in action. If this situation continues to develop, not only will the leading cadres continue to fall into the quagmire of bureaucracy, but it will also hinder the progress of the general comrades. Therefore, I suggest that the leading comrades of our unit should immediately and strictly correct this.

            Hong Wenhao, Boshan Grain Branch Company, Shandong

    Editor's Note: The tendency to disregard politics exists to varying degrees in many of our work departments. The situation of the Boshan Grain Branch Company prominently demonstrates this erroneous tendency. The nature of this tendency is serious, and it will cause immeasurable losses to our revolutionary cause. Leading cadres at all levels and in all organizations must correct the tendency to neglect political leadership.

### 博山粮食支公司领导干部应纠正忽视政治领导倾向

    博山粮食支公司领导干部应纠正忽视政治领导倾向编辑同志：
    自从人民日报六月八日发表了中共平原新乡地委反对不问政治倾向的通报之后，这个问题已引起了各地的严重注意。但是，还有些机关的领导同志仍然视而不见，听而不闻；有些机关部门的领导同志虽然从口头上承认自己在领导上也存在这个偏向，但并未在实际行动中有所改正，似乎是被事务压得喘不过气来。这说明他们的政治嗅觉已迟钝到什么程度。关于这种情况，我可以拿本公司作例来说明。
    我们公司是作粮食经济工作的。领导干部有单纯的任务观点，忽视政治领导与思想领导。如去年的整风运动就被工作任务压过去，实际上没有起多大作用。今年二月的订立爱国公约运动，我公司的领导干部也没有深入切实的领导，形成形式主义。领导上一向不重视政治学习，因此学习也不是有领导地进行的，只是按上级布置顺水流，不是从研究分析同志们的思想情况出发，然后通过文件学习，有目的有计划地去提高干部的思想认识。特别是领导干部自己也经常不参加政治学习，就是最近的党史学习亦不例外，总认为是老一套。我公司从上到下看报的人不多，对于当前国内外的政治情况变化不了解或者了解的也很少，普遍认为看报纸解决不了工作问题，不看报纸一样能把工作做好，或者强调“工作忙没有时间看”。不但如此，对于政治活动，如听市委报告、参加群众性的大会等，不是采取积极的态度，而是在思想上认为是“额外负担”、“工作闲还可以，现在忙的转不过身来”。我们全公司现在共有七十个同志，但是没有专职的人事干部。党内团内的思想教育都做得很不够，组织生活又不经常；就是开会，也既无准备，又无生动的内容。有的团员同志反映：“上次小组会是自我检讨，互相批评；这次也是自我检讨，说来说去还是那几句，不解决实际问题。”以上缺点的集中反映，就是：一般同志在工作中的任务观点，对革命事业缺乏自觉的钻研与进取心；致在工作中缺乏生气勃勃的精神，业务水平提高很慢。这些都是工作没有建筑在政治觉悟基础上的结果，是领导干部不问政治的倾向所造成的恶果。
    人民日报刊载的新乡地委的通报，我们已学过。领导上也觉察到本单位也有同样的问题存在，但就是没有从行动上改正过来。这种情况如果继续发展下去，不但领导干部继续陷于事务主义的泥淖，也会妨碍一般同志的进步。为此我建议本单位领导同志应立即严加纠正。
            山东博山粮食支公司  洪文豪
    编者按：不问政治的倾向在我们的许多工作部门里或多或少地存在着。博山粮食支公司的情况，突出地表现了这种错误倾向。这种倾向的性质是严重的，它将给我们的革命事业造成不可计量的损失。各地、各机关领导干部，必须纠正忽视政治领导的倾向。
