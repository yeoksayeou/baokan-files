    Farmer Representative
    Hu Nanqing's Speech
    Before I went to the Soviet Union, I had some questions I couldn't understand. For example, I heard that in a socialist society, everything is electrified, everyone eats from a communal pot, and if you get up late in the morning, it won't work; if the electricity is turned off, there's no fire, and you won't be able to eat. I also heard that in socialism, everything belongs to the state, and there's no distinction between yours and mine. I also heard that after Soviet farmers joined collective farms, their lives were very hard.
    On May 13th, we visited the "Spark" Collective Farm in Gorky City and realized how good Soviet collective farms really are, and how the happiness of Soviet farmers' lives is due to having a government of their own working people, and due to their good labor. Their current production volume has increased fifteen times compared to twenty years ago. Last year's total income was 1.4 million rubles, and one ruble is equivalent to about five catties of millet in our country, totaling 7 million catties. If we were to produce this amount using our handicraft methods, it would require more than 2,333 laborers, but they only need 337 laborers because they use tractors for plowing and machines for harvesting. Their animal husbandry production is also very good, especially their cattle. We saw their scientific animal husbandry methods firsthand. The cattle even drink tap water and take baths, and live in individual stalls, which have floors and are very elaborate. This was something I didn't expect. They use scientific methods for breeding. The bull is of the Dutch breed, and the cow is of the Soviet breed. The pigs they raise weigh 120 to 150 kilograms, equivalent to 300 catties in our country. One sow can raise eighteen to twenty piglets, all of which are very fat and large. They nurse on a schedule, which is also a very interesting method.
    Due to agricultural collectivization, the lives of Soviet farmers are indeed very good. Every day, each person can eat one and a half catties of bread, four ounces of meat, one pound of milk, as well as fruits, wine, and other things. The clothes they wear are also very beautiful, and their political and cultural lives are very advanced. There is no illiteracy, and they watch movies several times a week. Their lives are no different from those of urban people. Their work ethic is very good. Men have 400 workdays a year, and women have 280 workdays a year, with some doing as many as 600 to 900 workdays. How can you say their lives are not good?
    Soviet farmers have a very high level of patriotism. During the Great Patriotic War against Germany, the "Spark" Collective Farm worked hard to produce and support the front lines. They fully supplied military rations for two regiments and still maintain the supply for two regiments.
    That year, Golovaty, a farmer from the "Stakhanov" Collective Farm in the Saratov District, used his savings of 250,000 rubles to buy two airplanes and donate them to the state. He wrote a letter to Stalin, saying, "After the October Revolution, I became a wealthy collective farmer. In order to defend our happy life and our great Soviet motherland, I am using my savings to buy two airplanes and donate them to the motherland in order to fight those German devils." These two airplanes shot down fifteen German planes. Stalin sent a special telegram to Golovaty, thanking him for his love for the motherland. In factories and collective farms, we saw the Soviet people working hard for their country and for peaceful construction. They are paid according to their work, and the more they work, the more they are paid. The better they work, the more glorious they are. After returning to China, I gave reports to our vast number of farmers, workers, students, and citizens, and they were increasingly happy as they listened. After the report in Xiaozhuang Village, the farmers' reaction was, "People in the Soviet Union are doing so well, when will we be able to get there?" Farmer Du Yongfu said, "Don't be in a hurry! The Soviet Union took thirty years to get where they are. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, if we work hard in production and with the help of the Soviet Union, we will get there in ten years or so. Learn from the Soviet Union, and we will definitely live as well as Soviet farmers in the future." After hearing my report, more than 800 people from the village's 300-plus households joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. After citizens and workers in Chaoyang Guanxiang heard the report, 6,000 people joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association within a month. In the past, the farmers of Laoya Village in Chahar Province had heard rumors spread by the Kuomintang reactionaries, saying that in a socialist society, land would be divided, wives would be shared, and everyone would eat from a communal pot. But now, after hearing my report, these ideas have been completely eliminated. They said, "We must learn from the patriotic spirit of Soviet farmers, believe in science, and no longer listen to rumors." After hearing my report, the Hui people in Baotou City realized that all the nationalities in the Soviet Union, under the leadership of Marshal Stalin, are united and marching towards socialism together, and expressed their intention to have 70 percent of the population join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. After hearing my report, the workers of the Xinsui Flour Mill in Suiyuan saw the happy prospects of the new China from the socialist production and construction and the happy lives of the working people in the Soviet Union, and they began to work selflessly.
    Therefore, I think we must do a good job in promoting the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association among the farmers and educate them well to learn from the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the working class, Chinese farmers will surely be able to reach the level of Soviet farmers and live a good life of socialism and communism.

### 农民代表  胡楠卿的讲话

    农民代表
    胡楠卿的讲话
    我在未去苏联之前，有好些问题弄不明白。比如听说到了社会主义社会，一切电气化了，都吃大锅饭，早晨起床迟了就不行，电门一关没有火了，就吃不到饭；又听说到了社会主义，什么都是国家的，不分你的我的；又听说苏联农民加入集体农庄以后，生活很苦。
    五月十三日我们到高尔基城参观了“火花”集体农庄，才知道了苏联集体农庄真好，才知道了苏联农民的生活所以幸福，是由于有了劳动人民自己的政权，由于他们劳动好。他们现在的生产量比二十年前增加了十五倍。去年总收入一四○万卢布，一块卢布约合我国五斤小米，共计合七○○万斤。这个数字，如果用我们的手工业方法生产的话，要二千三百三十三个劳动力还多点，但他们只要三百三十七个劳动力就行了，因为他们是用拖拉机耕种、用机器收割的。他们的畜牧生产也是很好的，特别是牛，我们亲眼看到了他们的科学养畜方法。牛饮的也是自来水，还洗澡，住单间棚子，这种棚子里有地板，很讲究，这是我想不到的。他们用科学的方法配种，公牛是荷兰种，母牛是苏联种。他们养的猪，重达一百二十公斤到一百五十公斤，合我们的三百斤。一个母猪可养十八到二十个小猪，都很肥大，上下班吃奶，这也是很有趣的办法。
    由于农业集体化，苏联农民的生活的确很好。每天每人能吃到一斤半面包、四两肉、一磅牛奶，还有水果、酒等东西，穿的衣服也很漂亮，政治生活和文化生活都很高，没有文盲，一星期看几次电影。他们的生活与城市人民没有什么差别了。他们的劳动观点很好，男人一年有四百个劳动日，妇女一年有二百八十个劳动日，多的做到六百至九百个劳动日。你说他们的生活怎么不好呢？
    苏联农民的爱国主义热情是很高的，在抗德卫国战争时期，“火花”集体农庄努力生产支援前线，他们充分地供给两个团的军粮，到现在他们仍然保持供给两个团的给养。
    那年萨拉多夫区“斯达哈诺夫”集体农庄的农民戈洛瓦特，用自己积蓄的二十五万卢布买了两架飞机献给国家，他写了一封信给斯大林，他说：“十月革命以后，我变成了一个富有的集体农民了，为了保卫我们的幸福生活，为了保卫我们伟大的苏维埃祖国，以我的积蓄买了两架飞机，献给祖国，以便打那些德国鬼子。”这两架飞机曾击落了十五架德机。斯大林特地给戈洛瓦特打了一个电报，感谢他对祖国的爱护。我们在工厂里，在集体农庄里，都看到苏联人民为祖国、为和平建设而努力工作。他们是按劳取酬，谁劳动得多，报酬也愈多；谁劳动越好，谁越光荣。我回国之后，就向我国广大农民、工人、学生、市民作报告，他们越听越高兴。在小庄村报告后，农民的反映是：“人家苏联那样好了，咱们什么时候才走得到呢？”农民杜永福这样说：“你们别忙呵！苏联走了三十年才这样，咱们在毛主席领导下，好好生产，再加上苏联的帮助，有个十多年也就走到了。向苏联学习，将来一定过得和苏联农民那样好。”这村三百多户，听了我的报告，就有八百多人参加中苏友好协会。朝阳关厢市民、工人听了报告后，在一个月内有六千人参加了中苏友好协会。察哈尔省老鸦庄农民过去听过国民党反动派造谣，说什么到了社会主义社会，分土地、共产公妻、人都要吃大锅饭，但是现在听了我的报告以后，他们的这些思想完全消除了。他们说：“要学习苏联农民的爱国精神，相信科学，再不听信谣言了。”包头市的回民听了我的报告，认识苏联各民族在斯大林大元帅领导下友好团结，齐步地走向社会主义，就表示要作到百分之七十的人参加中苏友好协会。绥远新绥面粉厂的工人听了我的报告，从苏联社会主义的生产建设与劳动人民的幸福生活，看到了新中国的幸福远景，便忘我地劳动起来。
    因此，我想我们在农民中间一定要好好开展中苏友好协会的工作，好好教育农民学习苏联。中国农民在工人阶级领导下，一定能够达到苏联农民那样的地步，过社会主义、共产主义的好光景。
