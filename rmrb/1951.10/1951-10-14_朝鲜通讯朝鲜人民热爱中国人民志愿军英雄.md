Korean Dispatch: Korean People Love the Heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xiao Chi

Liu Guangzi, a first-class meritorious soldier of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, wearing a silver-white "Military Merit Medal" awarded by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, arrived at a village near the front line. Many Korean villagers from nearby villages ran to see Liu Guangzi and inquire about his stories of killing the enemy.

In this remote village, the American and Li bandits brutally murdered sixty-eight people, burned seventy houses, and looted a large number of livestock and property in just half a day last year. People deeply hate the American invaders and sincerely love the warriors who kill the enemy. An old man ran to the People's Committee and said: "We ask to see Liu Guangzi and celebrate his achievements."

On the night of July 17th, many villagers from four villages near the garrison put on clean clothes, brought gifts, and elementary school students holding flowers, braved the rain and gathered from mountain roads in all directions to the place where the celebration meeting was held.

At the meeting, Liu Guangzi, holding the flowers presented to him by the Korean people, said excitedly: "Today, the Korean elders braved the rain to celebrate my achievements, and I feel very honored. The Korean elders are my elders, and the disaster of the Korean elders is my disaster. When I saw the houses burned down and the sisters killed by the American devils, I made up my mind to avenge the Korean people. Determination gave me strength. With the cooperation of my comrades, I once killed nineteen American soldiers and captured sixty-three American soldiers with a flying mine in one battle." His speech aroused a storm of applause. A woman named Xu Baopei shook Liu Guangzi's hand tightly and said, "You can capture sixty-three prisoners alive on the battlefield by yourself. You are truly a hero!"

There were no lights in the venue. Someone suggested to see Liu Guangzi's face, so they lit tree branches to illuminate the entire venue. Liu Guangzi stood proudly in front of everyone with his chest out. People looked at the "Military Merit Medal" on his chest, and some gave a thumbs up and said: "Hero, you have avenged my hatred!" The woman Xu Baopei raised her fist and shouted excitedly: "We women in the rear must strive to complete the production tasks of several people, learn from Liu Guangzi, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" The young Yun Zaishu said: "When I grow up, I will definitely join the People's Army, learn from Uncle Liu, and be a hero." The seventy-year-old man, Jin Jimin, offered a bowl of wine to Liu Guangzi. People surrounded Liu Guangzi, singing and jumping enthusiastically until late at night.

    朝鲜通讯朝鲜人民热爱中国人民志愿军英雄
    新华社记者  肖池
    中国人民志愿军某部一等功臣刘广子，胸前戴着一枚银白色的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府授予的“军功章”，到达了临近前线的某村。驻地附近村庄的许多朝鲜老乡都跑来看刘广子，打听他的杀敌故事。
    在这个偏僻的乡村里，去年美李匪军在半天中就残杀了六十八个人，烧了七十幢房屋，抢劫了大批牲畜和财物。人们深深地仇恨美国侵略者，衷心地热爱杀敌的勇士们。一位老大爷跑到里人民委员会去说：“我们要求看看刘广子，给刘广子庆功。”
    七月十七日夜里，驻地附近四个村的许多老乡换上了干净衣服，带着礼物，小学生们手里拿着鲜花，冒雨从四面山道上汇集到开庆功会的地点。
    会上，刘广子拿着朝鲜人民献给他的鲜花，激动地说：“今天朝鲜父老们冒雨来给我庆功，我觉得非常光荣。朝鲜父老就是我的父老，朝鲜父老的灾难就是我的灾难，我看到被美国鬼子烧毁的房屋、杀死的姐妹，我就下定决心，替朝鲜人民报仇。决心使我有了力量。在战友们的配合下，我曾在一次战斗中用一个飞雷炸死了十九个美国兵，俘掳了六十三个美国兵。”他的讲话引起了暴风雨般的掌声。妇女许宝培紧紧握住刘广子的手说：“你一个人在战场上就能活捉六十三个俘虏，真是英雄呀！”
    会场上没点灯。有人提意见要求看看刘广子的脸，于是就燃起树枝火把来照亮了整个会场。刘广子挺着胸膛，雄伟地站在大家跟前。人们望着他胸前的“军功章”，有的伸着大拇指说：“英雄呀，我的仇你们给我报啦！”妇女许宝培举着拳头激动地喊道：“我们妇女在后方一个人要争取完成几个人的生产任务，向刘广子看齐，支援中国人民志愿军！”少年蕴在淑说：“我长大了一定参加人民军，向刘叔叔学习，做个英雄。”七十岁的老大爷金基满端了一碗酒，敬给刘广子。人们围着刘广子热情地歌唱跳跃，直到夜深。
