Response to readers' criticisms and suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

After reading Comrade Zhu Youzhang's article "Xiahe Village in Lingchuan, Shanxi Province, Disregards Substitute Farming and Insufficient Fertilization of Land Belonging to Revolutionary Soldiers' Families" in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on July 25th, we immediately sent personnel to Xiahe Village for four detailed inspections. There were indeed shortcomings in the village's substitute farming work, and the application of base fertilizer was indeed insufficient. After the village cadres took remedial measures, an additional 1,425 loads of top dressing fertilizer have now been applied, averaging 26 loads per mu. Including the base fertilizer, the average is now 90 loads, exceeding the original plan by 10 loads. Regarding the issue of "Revolutionary soldier Wang Bingchen's family having 2.2 mu of land that has not been fertilized for eight years" (according to our investigation, it is 1.55 mu), because the land is located in Gaojia Gou, four li away from the village, it is indeed difficult to transport fertilizer from home, so fertilizer could only be accumulated on the land itself (field-penned manure). This year, an average of 105 loads of base fertilizer were applied per mu. When applying top dressing fertilizer, the substitute farming team voluntarily contributed three loads of fertilizer from their own homes per person (totaling 21 loads). As for the fact that the preferential treatment committee member Wang Baoyu (not Wang Baowu) was unclear about the number of households in the village receiving substitute farming, this is indeed the case, and he is unqualified. Now, after inspection, the village's substitute farming work has been summarized, and appropriate measures have been taken to address the shortcomings.

    山西陵川第七区人民政府
    对下河村军属土地施肥不足问题已采取补救办法处理编辑同志：
    读人民日报七月二十五日“读者来信专页”朱有樟同志所写的“山西陵川下河村轻视代耕，烈军属的土地施肥不足”一文后，我们立即派专人到下河村作了四次详细的检查。该村代耕工作确有缺点，施底肥确是不足。经村干部设法补救后，现已增施追肥一千四百二十五担，每亩平均二十六担，连底肥平均已九十担，超过原订计划十担。关于“革命军人王丙辰家有二点二亩地八年没上过肥”（据我们调查是一点五五亩）的问题，因该地在离村四里远的高家沟，从家里运肥确有困难，只好在地内积肥
    （野圈肥）；今年每亩平均上底肥一百零五担，施追肥时，代耕组每人又自动从家里出了三担肥（共二十一担）。至于优抚委员王保玉（不是王保五）对该村享受代耕户的数字弄不清确系事实，他是不称职的。现在，该村代耕工作，经检查后，已作出总结，对缺点进行了适当处理。
