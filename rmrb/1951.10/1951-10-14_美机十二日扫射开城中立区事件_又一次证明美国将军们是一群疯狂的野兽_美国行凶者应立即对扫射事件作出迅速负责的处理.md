Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th – Our special correspondent reports: At 17:35 on the 12th, one hour and thirty-eight minutes after the adjournment of the liaison officers' meeting that day, three American military aircraft strafed the Kaesong neutral zone twice. One of the strafing locations was about five kilometers northwest of Kaesong, and the other was Panmunjom in the southeast of Kaesong. The situation of the former being strafed has not yet been investigated, while the latter has been jointly investigated by both sides. After our liaison officer, Colonel Chai Chengwen, completed the investigation at Panmunjom, he was ordered to lodge a serious verbal protest with the US side and stated that he reserved the right to make all demands.

This strafing incident occurred in broad daylight, so the style, flight formation, circling, and dive-bombing strafing of the three American military aircraft that came to wreak havoc were clearly visible. Military personnel who witnessed the incident determined that these three aircraft were jet fighters. One of the main characteristics of this type of aircraft is that it carries one fuel tank under each of its left and right wings. Our military police, who were on duty at a hilltop northwest of Kaesong for air observation, observed it particularly clearly. According to military police Xia Jiansheng, the three aircraft first circled over an area more than 20 miles southwest of Kaesong, and then two aircraft, one in front and one behind, with another on the right side, flew northwest in formation. Two of them circled once in the Kaesong neutral zone, and then dived northwest to strafe, while the other circled in the upper right side while the two aircraft strafed. After the strafing, the circling aircraft passed through the sky above Kaesong, frequently swaying left and right to reconnoiter, and the other two strafing aircraft followed the aircraft, forming the original formation, and flew from northwest to southeast. Soon after, the sound of strafing was heard in the southeast of Kaesong.

After the incident, our side immediately notified the other side's liaison officer to come to the scene at Panmunjom to conduct a joint investigation. The other side's liaison officer, Colonel Darrow, and Lieutenant Colonel Edwards, arrived at the scene at 21:07 after receiving our notification and conducted a joint investigation with our liaison officer. All the evidence was presented intact to the investigators. After the investigation, it was found that there were 32 bullet marks on the highway about 1,000 meters west of the meeting place in Panmunjom and on both sides of the highway, and the warhead of the armor-piercing machine gun bullet remained in some of the bullet marks.

The child killed by the American plane was named Jiang Yongdun, 12 years old, and his two-year-old brother Jiang Yongzhi was also wounded. Their sixty-year-old father, Jiang Daxing, eldest brother Jiang Yongfu, third brother Jiang Yongyun, and a Korean military policeman, Wu Taihe, appeared before the investigators as witnesses and indignant accusers. The investigators from both sides questioned the people on the highway next to the dead child, and all the witnesses proved that the aircraft that committed the crime came from the northwest and pointed out that these aircraft were UN military jet fighters.

The victim's third brother, Jiang Yongyun, is a fifteen-year-old boy. When the American plane came to strafe, he was fishing in a small stream on the left side of the highway, and his younger brother Jiang Yongdun was sitting on the side of the road with Jiang Yongzhi in his arms. Three American planes flew low from the northwest. One of them suddenly dived and strafed, killing Jiang Yongdun, who was sitting on the side of the road. The bullet entered between the sixth and seventh ribs of the left chest and exited from the same part of the right chest. After being hit by the bullet, Jiang Yongdun rolled down from the side of the road to the side of the stream. The little brother Jiang Yongzhi in Jiang Yongdun's arms was injured in the bone of his right hand and was left aside. During the investigation, Jiang Yongdun, who was brutally murdered, was lying on his back by the stream, with his chest open and bloodstains clearly visible. Jiang Yongdun's mother was sitting on the side of the road with Jiang Yongzhi in her arms. Anyone with a little conscience would express deep sympathy and indignation at this tragic scene. However, Darrow and his ilk were indifferent. It was clear that Jiang Yongyun had hidden in the bridge hole when the American plane strafed, but Darrow deliberately asked him: How many strafing planes did you see? Which one was strafing? After giving his testimony, the old father of the dead child angrily questioned the other side's liaison officer: You agreed not to bomb or strafe the neutral zone, but today you came and killed my son. You just want to investigate and then go back, this will not work. What are you going to do? In the face of this just protest, Darrow was speechless and unable to answer.

The investigation lasted for about an hour. At the end, the other side's liaison officer, Colonel Darrow, requested to come again tomorrow for investigation. Our liaison officer, Colonel Chai Chengwen, said: The investigation at Panmunjom has proven the fact of the strafing incident by the UN military aircraft, but our side does not object to the other side continuing to come for investigation tomorrow. Colonel Chai solemnly stated at the end: I am ordered by our chief representative to lodge a serious verbal protest with you and reserve the right to make all demands. Both sides agreed to continue the investigation at 9:00 am on the 13th.

The armistice negotiations, which were forced to be suspended due to the bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone by American planes on the evening of August 22 in an attempt to assassinate our armistice negotiation representatives, have been suspended for 52 days. During this period, how many soldiers have lost their lives on the front lines. While our side is making great efforts to resume negotiations, American planes have once again invaded the neutral zone and killed innocent children. American generals are such a group of heartless beasts. The people of the world are still looking forward to the end of the bloodshed in Korea. The American perpetrators should immediately make a swift and responsible handling of this strafing incident. The US side will face another serious test to see if it is still using denial tactics to undermine the armistice negotiations.

### 美机十二日扫射开城中立区事件  又一次证明美国将军们是一群疯狂的野兽  美国行凶者应立即对扫射事件作出迅速负责的处理

    美机十二日扫射开城中立区事件
    又一次证明美国将军们是一群疯狂的野兽
    美国行凶者应立即对扫射事件作出迅速负责的处理
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者报道：十二日十七时三十五分，也就是当天双方联络官会议休会后的一小时三十八分，美国军用飞机三架两次扫射开城中立区。被扫射的地点，一处为开城西北约五公里处，另一处为开城东南的板门店。前者被扫射的情形尚未调查，后者已经双方会同调查。我方联络官柴成文上校在板门店调查完了后，奉命向美方提出了严重的口头抗议，并声明保留提出一切要求的权利。
    这次扫射事件是在白昼发生的，所以前来肆虐的三架美国军用飞机的式样、飞行队形、盘旋、俯冲扫射情形，都清楚可见。目睹此事的军方人士判定，这三架飞机是喷气式战斗机，这种飞机主要特征之一是在左右机翼下携有汽油箱各一个。在开城西北某处山岗担任对空观察职务的我军事警察，观察尤为清楚。据军事警察夏监生说：这三架飞机先在开城西南二十多里处上空盘旋，然后两架一前一后，另一架在右侧，列队向西北飞来。其中两架在开城中立区内盘旋一周后，即向西北俯冲扫射，另一架在两机扫射时，在右侧上空盘旋。扫射后，这一架盘旋的飞机穿过开城上空，频频左右摇摆侦察，另两架扫射的飞机即跟随该机，结成原来队形，由西北向东南飞去。不久，又听到开城东南有扫射的声音。
    事件发生后，我方即通知对方联络官前来板门店现场会同进行调查。对方联络官戴罗上校及爱德华中校接到我方通知后，于二十一时零七分到达现场，与我方联络官会同进行调查。一切证据均原封不动地呈现在调查人员面前，调查后，发现在板门店以西距会场约一千公尺的公路及两侧，有弹痕三十二处，在若干弹痕中，留存着机关枪穿甲弹的弹头。
    被美机射死的儿童名姜永敦，年十二岁，他的两岁的弟弟姜永植同时被射伤。他们的六十岁的父亲姜大兴、大哥姜永福、三哥姜永运以及一位朝鲜籍的军事警察吴太和在调查人员面前作见证人和悲愤的控诉者。双方调查人员在死难儿童身边的公路上进行查问，所有的证人都证明这次行凶的飞机自西北飞来，并指明这些飞机是联合国军的喷气式战斗机。
    被害者的三哥姜永运是一个十五岁的少年。美机前来扫射时，他正在公路左侧的一条小溪里捕鱼，他的弟弟姜永敦抱着姜永植坐在路边。三架美国飞机从西北低飞而来。其中一架突然俯冲扫射，将坐在路边的姜永敦打死。子弹从左胸第六、第七两肋骨之间射入，自右胸相同部位穿出。姜永敦中弹后，即从路边滚下小溪边。姜永敦怀中的小弟弟姜永植右手骨被击伤，被丢在旁边。在调查时，惨遭毒手的姜永敦仰卧在溪边，胸部敞开，血迹显明。姜永敦的母亲怀抱姜永植坐于路侧。稍有良心的人目睹这种悲惨情景，莫不表示深切的同情与愤慨。但是，戴罗之流却无动于衷。明明姜永运在美机扫射时已吓得躲入桥洞，但戴罗却故意问他：你看见扫射的飞机是几架？是那一架扫射的。死难儿童的老父在作证后，愤怒地责问对方联络官：你们讲好了不到中立区来轰炸扫射，今天来打死了我的儿子。你们只是来调查一下就想回去了，这决不能行。你们究竟怎么办？在这种正义的抗议面前，戴罗也哑口无言，不能作答。
    调查历一小时许，在结束时，对方联络官戴罗上校要求明日再来调查。我方联络官柴成文上校表示：板门店调查已证明联合国军军用飞机扫射事件的事实，但我方也不反对对方明日继续前来调查。柴上校最后郑重声明：我奉我方首席代表之命，向你方提出严重口头抗议，并保留提出一切要求的权利。双方同意于十三日晨九时继续进行调查。
    由于美机在八月二十二日晚轰炸开城中立区，企图谋杀我方停战谈判代表而被迫停开的停战谈判，迄今已停顿五十二天，在这个时期中，在前线又有多少士兵失去了生命。而在我方为恢复谈判作重大努力时，美机却又一次地侵入中立区，杀害天真的儿童，美国将军们竟是这样一群狼心狗肺的野兽。世界的人民仍在期待朝鲜流血的终止，美国行凶者应当立即对这次扫射事件作出迅速负责的处理。美方又将面对一次严重的考验，看它是否仍在用抵赖的手段来破坏停战谈判。
