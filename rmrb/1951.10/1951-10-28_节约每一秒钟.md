    Saving Every Second
    Labor Model of Northeast Fourth Rubber Factory, Liu Jinggui
    Starting this year, our factory is making shoes for the Volunteer Army, and our output has to increase by 60% compared to normal. The comrades in our group were very enthusiastic and agreed to the new task without adding manpower. Everyone was afraid of not being able to complete the production plan, so they secretly worked overtime, even during the Spring Festival holiday, without rest. After a month and a half of this, everyone was visibly getting thinner. I felt both sorry and anxious, and I only hated that my position as group leader was useless, and I couldn't think of a good solution. In my anxiety, I stayed up in the workshop for two days and two nights, but still couldn't solve the problem.
    The factory director talked to me, saying that the Volunteer Army's victory was not only based on courage, but also on wisdom. It's the same in the rear supporting the war against America and aiding Korea. Enthusiasm alone cannot solve the problem; we must use our brains more to improve operating methods and increase labor efficiency. I spent all day circling around the eleven machines, unable to find any problems. One day, after circling around four or five times, I noticed that it took time to smear the soles of the shoes and place them on the shelf. I took out my pocket watch and watched for a full two hours, estimating that this action took five seconds. At first, I didn't think a few seconds mattered much. Later, I thought that our output was large, and saving a few seconds for one action would add up. Peng Mingchang and I tried it out, smearing the soles under the table conveniently, and saving two minutes for every twenty pairs of shoes made. Peng Mingchang tried it for a day, and his usual highest output was 1,100 pairs, but that day he made 1,400 pairs. I called a group meeting to promote this working method. At first, some comrades opposed, saying, "Aren't you willing to take a breath while working?" I said, "Comrades, is the Volunteer Army relaxed on the front line?" Everyone changed their actions, and the output increased by 20%. This matter attracted the attention of the leadership, and they sent a "second timer" to "time" the work, and this action saved four seconds. Everyone was convinced and began to study ways to improve work methods. Previously, taking and putting down scissors to cut the thread ends took three seconds, but tying the small scissors to the hand could save two seconds. In the past, the placement of work was not uniform, but now placing it uniformly on the leg saves one second. The assistant helping the technician take the shoe upper saves another two seconds. These four processes together save nine seconds, and the output increases by 30%. Later, we learned the Kovalev working method, looking for each person's working "tricks," concentrating on the advantages, and unifying operating procedures, and the output increased by another 30%. Now, our group's highest output is 2,200 pairs of shoes per person per day, an increase of 100% compared to the daily output of 1,100 pairs in December last year, and the quality reaches 99.5%. In this way, we calculate every second to increase our output and support our most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. (Attached picture)

    节约每一秒钟
    东北第四橡胶厂劳动模范  刘景贵
    今年起，我们厂给志愿军做鞋，产量要比平常提高百分之六十。我们小组同志热情很高，不添人手答应下了新的任务。大伙怕完不成生产计划，暗暗加班加点，春节放假也不休息，这样干了一个半月，没有一个人有一言半语。只是眼看着一个个瘦下来了。我又心疼又着急，只恨我这小组长不顶用，想不出好的办法。我一发急，在班上连顶两天两夜，也没有解决问题。
    厂长找我谈话，说志愿军打胜仗不单凭勇气，还得凭智慧。在后方抗美援朝也一样，光凭热情解决不了问题，要多开动脑筋改进操作方法，提高劳动效率。我成天围着十一台机器瞅，找不出什么毛病。有一天，我转了四五转，看出做鞋时把鞋底抹好放在货架上费时间。我掏出怀表站着整整看了两个钟点，估准这个动作要花费五秒钟。最初我还觉得几秒钟顶不了多少事。后来一想，我们产量大，一个动作省下几秒时间就不少。我和彭命长试了一下，把鞋底顺手往桌下抹，做二十双鞋就省下二分钟。彭命长试了一天，平时他的最高产量是一千一百双，这天他做了一千四百双。我召开小组会推广这个工作法。起初，有的同志反对：“你做活还不愿意喘口气？”我说：“同志，志愿军在前线轻松吗？”大伙改了动作，产量提高百分之二十。这件事引起了领导上的注意，派了“秒定员”来“秒定”时间，这个动作节省了四秒钟。大伙信服了，都来研究改进工作方法。以前拿放剪刀绞断线头要三秒钟，把小剪刀拴在手上可以节省两秒。过去放活不统一，现在统一放在腿上省下一秒。帮工帮技工拿鞋帮又省两秒。这四个过程一共省了九秒时间，产量提高百分之三十。以后又学习郭瓦廖夫工作法，找各人工作“窍门”，集中优点，统一操作规程，产量又提高百分之三十。现在，我们小组最高产量是一人每天做鞋二千二百双，比去年十二月份日产一千一百双提高百分之一百，质量达到百分之九十九点五。就这样，我们一秒钟一秒钟地计算着，来提高我们的产量，来支援我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。（附图片）
