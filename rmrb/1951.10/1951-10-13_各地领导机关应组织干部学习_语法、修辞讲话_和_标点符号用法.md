    To the Editor:
    Since the People's Daily editorial "Correctly Use the Motherland's Language, and Struggle for the Purity and Health of the Language!" was published, it has generally attracted attention in various regions. Some organs have formulated measures to correct the phenomenon of language confusion and conduct regular inspections. However, many places have not paid enough attention to this issue. I recently read the work reports sent by various counties in northern Jiangsu, and from these work reports, it can be seen that the phenomenon of language confusion is serious. For example:
    (1) Ungrammatical sentences and unclear meaning: such as "Ordinary rural theatrical troupes, prescribed meaning (righteousness) performance donation"; "Started the guarantee of victorious completion"; "They wavered about the policy"; "The patriotic convention of residents of a certain district and a certain township was made by elementary school teachers, mimeographed, and some people still don't know what it is!"; "Created a sensational work situation"; "Educate cadres and militiamen to pay attention to concealing the activities of counter-revolutionary elements," and so on. There are many such examples.
    (2) Abuse of abbreviations and simplified characters, etc.: such as writing "The land reform work is over" as "Land End"; writing "Activists" as "Acti-"; writing "Formulating Patriotic Pacts" as "Formulating Pacts," and so on. The phenomenon of not using punctuation or misusing punctuation, and writing simplified characters in a novel way, exists in almost every mimeographed document.
    I believe that this chaotic phenomenon in the use of language and writing must be corrected in a timely manner. I suggest that the leading institutions of all provinces and cities treat the correction of language confusion as a political task and resolutely implement the spirit of "correctly using the language of the motherland." In addition to examining the principles and policies of the documents sent by the higher-level organs to the lower-level organs, they should also point out at any time what shortcomings there are in the text and help to correct them. At the same time, according to the "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric" published by the People's Daily and the "Usage of Punctuation Marks" published by the General Administration of Publications, they should universally organize cadres to study and conduct tests when necessary, to gradually improve everyone's writing ability.

### 各地领导机关应组织干部学习“语法、修辞讲话”和“标点符号用法”

    各地领导机关应组织干部学习“语法、修辞讲话”和“标点符号用法”编辑同志：
    人民日报社论“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”发表以后，一般地说，已引起各地的注意。有的机关并制定了纠正语言混乱现象的办法，经常进行检查。但也有不少地方对于这个问题还没有引起足够的重视。我最近读了苏北各县送来的工作报告，从这些工作报告中可以看出语言的混乱现象是严重的。例如：
    （一）句法不通，意义不明：如“普通农村剧团，订出意（义）演捐献”；“起了胜利完成的保证”；“他们对政策产生了动摇”；“某区某乡居民的爱国公约是小学教师，油印的，有些群众尚不知什么！”；“造成轰轰烈烈的工作情况”；“教育干部和民兵，注意隐蔽反革命分子的活动”等。这样的例子很多。
    （二）滥用省略、简体字等：如把“土地改革工作结束”写成“土结”；把“积极分子”写成“积子”；把“订立爱国公约”写成“订约”等。不用标点或乱用标点，标新立异地写简字的现象，几乎在每一份油印文件中都有。
    我认为这种运用语言文字的混乱现象是必须及时纠正的。我建议各省市领导机构，把纠正语言混乱现象当作一件政治工作来做，坚决贯彻“正确地使用祖国的语言”的精神。上级机关对下级机关送来的文件，除了审查其原则方针以外，并随时指出它在文字上有什么缺点，帮助纠正；同时根据人民日报发表的“语法、修辞讲话”和出版总署所公布的“标点符号用法”，普遍地组织干部学习，必要时举行测验，以便逐步提高大家的写作能力。
