The People's Republic of China has been established for two years. This is but a moment, a fleeting instant in history. Yet, within this short period, the Chinese people have not only become masters of their own land, but our republic has also become one of the most stable, progressive, and powerful nations in the world.

The epic-like achievements have several main driving forces. First, is the profound leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government. Second, is the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people, their recognition of the necessity of struggle, their willingness to endure hardship, and their readiness to sacrifice in order to complete the great task of independence, people's democracy, and the reconstruction of our country.

In these two years, our leaders and our people, working together with one heart and one mind, have launched a series of mass movements, the scale, scope, and achievements of which are unprecedented in China's long history. The land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland movement – have touched the lives of everyone in all walks of life, all social strata, and with different political and religious beliefs. The overwhelming participation of the Chinese people in these movements has laid the foundation for our republic to move from one success to another, and its strength to increase step by step to the highest degree. These three major movements have consolidated the victory of the Chinese revolution and prepared the foundation for future progress. Similarly, they also show that we will not easily allow our fruits to be taken from our hands.

	Land Reform

The thorough and rapid realization of land reform is a great victory. Areas accounting for two-thirds of China's agricultural population, more than 310 million people, have already experienced this great transformation struggle. It is expected that this movement will be completed on our mainland by the spring of 1952. Only special areas are exceptions, mostly areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, where progress will be slower and will be based on local conditions. In general, we can now say that in our country, it is already "land to the tiller." On the second anniversary of our People's Republic, we can rejoice in this achievement, which is extremely beneficial to our present and future.

Land reform is a fundamental feature of the Chinese revolution. If we want to build a people's democracy, to prosper and become strong, and to have the strength to defend ourselves, then the first thing that needs to be reformed in the old society is the lives of our peasants. The feudal system was based on the oppression of peasants. It was the feudal system that created the gap, allowing imperialism to take advantage of it, driving us towards poverty and backwardness. Therefore, land reform was stipulated in our Common Program. The Land Reform Law stipulates the method of confiscating the land of landlords and distributing it to peasants with no or little land. This law is based on the rich experience of the Chinese Communist Party. This law has had remarkable results. In other words, the Chinese people know what they should do, and they do it resolutely.

Land reform has all the characteristics of revolutionary struggle. We rely on poor peasants and farm laborers, unite with middle peasants, and neutralize rich peasants. Except for landlords who have committed crimes, we still allocate enough land to landlords to enable them to maintain their lives and transform themselves through labor. We do not eliminate them physically, but we resolutely eliminate the feudal exploitation they represent and all its manifestations. Through land reform, we have declared the death sentence of the feudal system. The landlord class is no longer an economic and political class. Rural life is now entirely managed by the peasant masses.

Due to its extreme complexity, land reform requires very careful and thorough preparation and implementation. The actual work needs to be completed step by step. If an area is not fully prepared, the movement will be temporarily suspended until the peasant masses have awareness and make demands before it is implemented. Once launched, the most complex and extremely important task of class division requires flexible and precise handling. Class division is based on the diverse relationships between people and the means of production. Various different production relations between exploiters and the exploited need to be considered and appropriately handled.

It is easy to say that 310 million people have undergone land reform. It is infinitely difficult to describe all the arduous work involved in the struggle. Behind this number is the tireless work of land reform cadres, their ability to handle various problems, their patience and understanding of the peasants, and their calmness and courage in the face of danger.

We must also note that the victory of land reform would not have been possible without the enthusiastic support of the peasants. This is manifested in their participation in peasant associations. It is through this organization that peasants verified the available land and ensured that the land was distributed fairly. In these activities, the peasant association concretely demonstrated the meaning of collective strength and the application of democratic methods. After land reform, peasants went on to govern the affairs of their villages, then to the district, county, and up to the highest-level institutions. This explains why peasant associations have 84 million members, and in some villages, membership is as high as 50 percent. The total number of members includes a large number of women. Land reform is a true liberation for them because it gives them ownership of land and economic independence.

Through peasant associations, peasants' political awareness is enlightened, the science of land use is valued, and the future vision of Chinese peasants—collective farming—has emerged.

The increase in productivity is the result of peasants obtaining land and raising their political activity. This is precisely the purpose of land reform: to liberate potential talents and creativity so that agricultural products are self-sufficient and lay the foundation for industrialization. This was Sun Yat-sen's ideal. This is the basic program of the Chinese Communist Party. This is the action program of the Central People's Government. This is the only correct solution to China's poverty.

Our Northeast and old liberated areas are proof of this. There, most of the rural population has become middle peasants, and there is little difference between them and poor peasants. In general, their lives are improving day by day. They have surplus grain in their warehouses. That means an increase in demand for industrial products. This demand is a guarantee for China's industrial construction.

Therefore, the great land reform movement affects the absolute majority of the Chinese population. This is the vitality of our survival today and the foundation of our tomorrow.

	Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries

The second great mass movement—the suppression of counter-revolutionaries—accomplished several important tasks in one fell swoop. It effectively exposed those scum who attempted to harm our new life, and arrested and punished them. In this process, our people have a deeper understanding of the importance of unity, and immeasurably strengthened their confidence in collective strength.

The people of our progressive country understand and practice the policy of leniency. But we also know it has a limit. If we are too lenient, bad elements will take advantage of this, resulting in damage to the country. Revolutionary cadres were murdered; crops were burned; factories were sabotaged; people were harassed by baseless rumors; the friendly relations between our nationalities were threatened. This is something we can never tolerate.

For thirty years, the Chinese people have been engaged in revolutionary struggles, fighting to create a people's country. Many arduous battles have been fought, and many revolutionaries have sacrificed themselves. Can we let all these tremendous efforts, sufferings, and sacrifices be wasted? Can we allow our revolutionary achievements to go undefended? Of course not. Chairman Mao has instructed us that unless we take steps to eliminate the activities of counter-revolutionaries, the people's country will be endangered. Therefore, our people demand protection and preventive measures.

The government has fulfilled the people's call, maintaining their safety and revolutionary order, which is its responsibility to the people. In February of this year, a law was promulgated, which, together with Article 7 of the Common Program and other instructions, established a complete procedure to expose those who are actively engaged in anti-people activities, to detail and convincingly confirm their crimes, to give them a fair trial, and to give them the punishment they deserve. This law has been praised by various democratic parties, democrats, and people's organizations. It has received widespread support from the general public, who enthusiastically assist the public security forces in pursuing bad elements.

Peasants and workers, students and professors, the industrial and commercial sectors, housewives, cultural workers, and various religious circles—all participated in this movement. The scale of participation in this movement proves the level of political awareness that the Chinese people have. They realize that the special agents of imperialism and the reactionaries are the deadly enemies of domestic and world peace. Therefore, our people have tightened their ranks and mobilized their forces to overthrow these enemies.

The people are active in all stages of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. They hunt down and hand over criminals. They are not afraid of trouble and help provide evidence. The people sit on the jury for trials. Millions of them participated in public trial meetings.

This is a very complex task. It takes time and patience. However, our vigilant public security cadres and the people have that patience. They spend the necessary time to pursue every clue. The investigation of some cases involves several provinces. All efforts are made to ensure absolute accuracy before the guilty are brought to trial. No charges are made without concrete evidence. Every fact is repeatedly investigated and verified. This proves the responsible attitude of the Chinese people towards the law, and their serious attitude towards dealing with the threat of counter-revolutionaries.

The results of this movement have clearly inspired the spirit of all our people. In the cities, although many cities have been liberated for two years, some people have not really felt the full joy of liberation. The criminals left over from the old society continued to oppress them brutally. These were typical bandits who operated in our streets, mixed into our factories, and suppressed our dockworkers. Now that these bad elements have been eliminated, our city residents are truly liberated. Now our workers work with a light heart. They are tackling their problems with renewed vigor, determined to protect their homes and factories forever, and to increase production.

This mass movement has also further liberated the peasants. They have cleared out those hidden feudal remnants who set fire to crops and who thought that assassinating rural political cadres could overthrow the revolution, engaging in conspiracy activities. Now, the land is secure, and the peasants are organized to defend it. Now, they can concentrate on production. This is especially a new experience in more recently liberated areas.

While seeing their own achievements, the Chinese people also recognize that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a long-term struggle. As long as imperialism exists, as long as there is a base from which these criminals can be supplied and sent in to harm the people of our country, then this struggle must exist. Therefore, our policy is: to be forever vigilant; to be lenient with those special agents who have completely severed ties with imperialism and the reactionaries and sincerely repent their crimes; but to ruthlessly hunt down and eliminate those who continue to have their hands stained with the blood of the people.

In short, this movement is another major defeat for the imperialists and feudal elements. Among our hundreds of millions of people, the only ones they can recruit to do their despicable deeds are a few long-time troublemakers. However, the people have taken control of the situation. Our internal strength has grown, and our country is guaranteed to be in the hands of the people. In this way, we have made another brilliant and greater contribution to our future, as well as to ensuring world peace.

	Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland

Today, the mass movement of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Protecting the Homeland has penetrated into the daily life of the Chinese people. This movement was launched by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression because defending world peace is inseparable from the actual threat of an imperialist aggressor. This great patriotic movement links the safety and peace of our motherland, opposition to the arming of Japan and West Germany, and the demand for a peace pact between the five great powers. It makes the Chinese people stand shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people on the forefront of defending peace.

It is natural for us to aid Korea. First of all, our two countries have had historical relations for thousands of years. In modern times, especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan, our relationship was particularly close. At that time, as now, our two nations had a common imperialist enemy. Many sons and daughters of the Korean people joined our renowned Eighth Route Army, and many of them sacrificed their lives for the liberation of China. Therefore, our comradeship is deeply rooted.

Secondly, North Korea is a people's country. Therefore, it is also part of the world peace camp. We cannot sit idly by and watch the warmongers annex it.

Another reason is that the Chinese people are fully familiar with the strategy of "occupying Korea first." With the deepest resentment, we recall that the Japanese warlords followed the same path to invade our Northeast.

Therefore, we have only one way forward – to help our neighbors, which is also to help ourselves and the cause of world peace. We launched the mass movement of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and the whole country moved like one person. We gave manpower support to the front lines. Our volunteers, with inspiring heroism, told the aggressors that they would be held responsible for their insane destruction. We gave material support to the front lines, while carrying out production increase movements and massive donation campaigns. Our people have never acted so quickly and forcefully in their entire history. One example of this is increasing production through labor competitions. The labor competition itself is a mass movement, which has been widely promoted throughout the country through the medium of patriotic pacts.

The Chinese working class understands that the soldiers on the front lines and the workers at the workbench in the rear are closely linked, and the factory is also a battlefield. Therefore, they fight to increase production, reduce costs, and improve quality. According to the latest statistics, this movement includes 2.23 million workers who have signed patriotic pacts, and 11,159 groups have responded to the Ma Hengchang group. This movement has spread to various factories and enterprises.

Chinese workers have also shown that they are the creators of the new century. The labor competition movement is not only a driving force for promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, but also prepares for China's future industrialization. Workers and technicians no longer accept old methods and old systems without critical research. Now they have reversed the old order and become masters of the machines. They consider the issue of raising production levels with a scientific and revolutionary attitude, retaining the good parts of the old things, and tirelessly seeking new methods. In addition, the old idea of ​​withholding skills for personal gain has also been abandoned. Today, new inventions must serve the people and be disseminated to other departments and factories, the wider the better. This point of view unites the entire working class more closely, and also forms a new type of worker that more effectively combines the skills and creativity of physical labor. This also allows workers to be quickly promoted to administrative positions. For example, last year nearly 7,000 miners in the mines became section chiefs, technicians, and administrative personnel.

Increased production means more materials can be taken to support the front lines, and the lives of workers are also improving at an exciting pace. Without inflation robbing their wages, they eat and dress better, and housing conditions have also improved. Medical and other welfare services stipulated by labor insurance are gradually expanding to more workers. The safety and hygiene of the working environment are constantly improving. Also, not only can the children of workers go to school, but the workers themselves can make up for their past losses through an increasing number of cultural and educational institutions. In short, the lives of our workers have completely changed, both in the workplace and in their homes.

This situation can be realized in China today because labor is respected in our country, and workers are the masters. This has politically educated our workers. Through labor competitions, they have demonstrated their understanding of the spirit and principles of internationalism, knowing how this is part of the work of protecting the homeland.

The donation movement that directly supports the front lines also demonstrates the strength of the new China. We can see that we are not only able to improve the lives of the people, but we are also able to send cannons and bullets, tanks and airplanes, to our soldiers, so that they can use them to defend peace. We have already talked about how the workers are contributing their strength. But the peasants are also increasing production and making donations. Non-productive workers—teachers, shop assistants, relief workers, cultural workers—are all able to do some extra work or donate money to support the front lines. So far, donations have reached the equivalent of 2,482 aircraft, in addition to a large number of artillery pieces, anti-aircraft guns, and tanks.

In this great movement of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, the facts at the front and at home show the meaning of the words "new, enlightened Asia." These facts prove that even the most powerful imperialism, even with a group of vassal states as accomplices, can be completely defeated. Although the struggle is long-term and arduous, its outcome is beyond doubt: the Chinese and Korean people will win this war. This is a just war for our survival and for the happiness of all mankind.

	Conclusion

Land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect the Homeland – these three great mass movements have made the first two years of our People's Republic the most glorious two years in history. We have added our strength to the struggle for peace and given a major blow to the main enemy of peace. We have used our strength to strengthen the struggle of all Asian nations for independence. On this second anniversary of our People's Republic, let us remember these major achievements, while preparing for the next step forward.

    伟大的中国三大运动
    ——为“人民中国”国庆纪念专刊作
    宋庆龄
    中华人民共和国已经成立了两周年。这在历史中仅一瞬间，一刹那。然而这短时期之内，中国人民不仅在自己的国土上成为自己的主人，而且我们的共和国已经成为世界上最稳固、进步和强大的国家之一。
    英雄史诗似的成就是有几个主要原动力的。首先是毛主席，中国共产党以及中央人民政府的深刻领导。第二是中国人民群众的爱国热情，他们认识到斗争的必要，愿意忍受艰苦，不惜牺牲，为了完成独立、人民民主以及重建我们的国家的大业。
    这两年内，我们的领导和我们的人民，同心协力地发动了一系列的群众运动，其规模、范围和成就都是中国的悠久历史从来没有过的。土地改革，镇压反革命分子，抗美援朝保家卫国运动——已经触及全国各界，各阶层，各不同政治和宗教信仰的每一个人的生活。中国人民这样排山倒海地参与这些运动，奠定了基础，使我们的共和国，从一个成功走到一个成功，力量步步增加而达最高度。这三大运动巩固了中国革命的胜利，并且为未来的进展准备了基础。同样，它们也表明，我们是不会随便让我们的果实从我们的手中被夺去的。
    土地改革
    土地改革的彻底和迅速实现是一个伟大的胜利。占中国农业人口三分之二，多到三亿一千万以上人口的地区已经体验了这个大翻身的斗争。预计到一九五二年春，这个运动即将在我们大陆上完成。仅有特殊地区例外，那多是居住着少数民族的地区，那里的进展要慢一些，要根据当地的情况。大体上，我们现在可以说，在我们国内，已经是“耕者有其田”了。在我们人民共和国的两周年，我们可以为一切对我们目前和将来极有裨益的这个成就欢欣鼓舞。
    土地改革是中国革命的一个基本特点。如果我们要建立人民民主，要繁荣富强，并有足以保卫我们自己的力量，那么旧社会里需要改革的第一件事就是我们的农民的生活。封建制度是建立在压迫农民的基础上的。正是封建制度，造成缺口，使得帝国主义乘虚而入，驱使我们走向贫困和落后。所以，在我们的共同纲领中规定了土地改革。从土地改革法规定了没收地主的土地，分配给无地和少地的农民的办法，这个法律是根据中国共产党丰富的经验而规定的。这个法律已有了显著的成效。换言之，中国人民晓得他们该做些什么，他们就毅然决然做去了。
    土地改革具有一切革命斗争的特征。我们依靠贫雇农，团结中农，中立富农。除了有犯罪行为的地主之外，我们对地主仍然分给足够的土地，使他们能够维持生活，在劳动中改造自己。我们并不消灭他们的肉体，但是我们坚决消灭他们所代表的封建剥削及其一切表现。通过土地改革，我们宣布了封建制度的死刑。地主阶级再也不是一个经济的和政治的阶级。农村生活从此全部由农民群众管理了。
    由于具有极端复杂性，土地改革是要很谨慎周密的准备和实行的。实际的工作需要有步骤地完成。如果一个地区还没有完全准备好，这个运动就暂不进行，直到农民群众有了认识和提出了要求，才开始实施。但一经发动，在划阶级这个最繁复和极端重要的工作上，就需要灵活和精确的处理。划阶级根据的是人和生产手段的多种多样的关系。剥削者与被剥削者之间各种不同的生产关系需要加以考虑和适当处理。
    三亿一千万人民已经经过土地改革了，这在嘴上说说是很容易的。而要描写进行斗争中一切艰巨的工作，却无限困难。这个数字后面有土地改革干部的不倦的工作，他们处理各种问题的能力，他们对于农民们的耐心和了解，他们在遇到危险时的冷静和勇敢。
    我们还必须注意，没有农民的热烈拥护，土地改革的胜利是不可能的。这表现于他们参加农民协会。农民是通过这个组织，核定了可用的土地，并使土地分配得公平。在这些工作中农民协会具体地显示了集体力量的意义和民主方式的应用。经过土地改革，农民进而治理他们本村的事情，然后到区、县，直到最高级机构。这说明了为什么农民协会拥有八千四百万会员，而有些村子里加入的竟高到百分之五十。在会员的总数中，包括了很大数目的妇女，土地改革对于她们是真正的解放，因为这使她们得到了土地的所有权和经济上的独立。
    经过农民协会，农民的政治觉悟得到启发，用之于土地的科学受到了重视，而且出现了中国农民将来的远景——集体农民。
    生产力提高是农民获得了土地，而且提高了他们的政治活动的结果。这正是土地改革的目的，解放潜在的才能和创造性，使得农业生产品自给自足，为工业化准备基础。这曾是孙中山的理想。这是中国共产党的基本纲领。这是中央人民政府的行动纲领。这是中国贫穷的唯一正确的解决办法。
    我们的东北和老解放区就是明证。那里大多数的农村人口已成为中农，而且贫农和他们很少差别。一般说来，他们的生活日益改善。他们仓库里有余粮。那就是意味着对工业品要求增加。这个要求是中国工业建设的保证。
    因此，伟大的土地改革运动影响到中国人口的绝对大多数。这是我们今天的生存的元气，我们的明天的基础。
    镇压反革命
    第二个伟大的群众运动——镇压反革命分子——一举完成了几个重要的任务。它有效地揭露了那些图谋危害我们的新生命的败类，逮捕和惩罚了他们。在这个过程中，我们的人民更深刻地认识了团结的重要，不可衡量地加强了对集体力量的信心。
    我们进步国家的人民是明白并实行着宽大政策的。但是我们也懂得它有一个限度。如果我们过于宽大了，坏分子利用这一点，结果使国家遭受到损害。革命干部被谋杀；庄稼被烧毁；工厂被破坏；人民被无稽的谣言所骚扰；我们民族之间的友好关系受到威胁。这是我们决不能容忍的。
    三十年来，中国人民一直在进行革命斗争，为创造一个人民的国家而战斗。打了许多艰辛的仗，许多革命者牺牲了。我们能让这一切巨大的努力、苦难和牺牲白白耗费了吗？我们可以让我们的革命成果不加保卫吗？当然不。毛主席曾指示我们，除非我们采取步骤去肃清反革命分子的活动，否则人民的国家就会受到危害。所以，我们的人民要求保护和预防的措施。
    政府满足了人民的呼声，维护他们的安全和革命的秩序，这是它对人民所应负的责任。今年二月间，颁布了一项法律，它和共同纲领第七条以及别的一些指示，建立起一个完备的程序来揭发那些积极从事反人民活动的人，详细列举和确凿证实他们的罪行，给他们公平的审判，给以应得的惩罚。这项法律受到各民主党派，民主人士和人民团体的称赞。它得到一般人民的广泛拥护，人民热诚地协助公安部队，追究不良分子。
    农民与工人，学生与教授，工商界，家庭妇女，文化工作者，各宗教界——都参加了这个运动。参加这个运动的规模之大证明中国人民已具有怎样的政治觉悟。他们认识到帝国主义和反动派的特务分子是国内和全世界和平的死敌。因此，我们的人民严密他们的队伍，动员了他们的力量来打倒这些敌人。
    人民在镇压反革命分子运动的各阶段都是积极的。他们追捕并交出罪犯。他们不怕麻烦，帮助提供罪证。人民坐在陪审员席上进行审判。他们成百万人参加了公审大会。
    这是很复杂的工作。它需要时间和耐心。然而我们的警觉的公安干部和人民有那个耐心，他们化费必要的时间来追究每一条线索，某些案件的调查牵涉到好几个省份。尽一切努力做到绝对确凿无误，才将罪人加以审讯。没有真凭实据决不构成罪状。每一件事实都一再调查核对。这证明中国人民对法律的负责态度，以及他们对付反革命分子的威胁的严肃态度。
    这个运动的结果明显地鼓舞了我们全体人民的精神。在城市里，虽然许多城市已解放了两年，还有一部分人民没有真正感受到解放的全部欢乐。旧社会所留下来的罪犯们继续在横暴地压迫他们。这些是典型的匪徒，他们在我们的街头活动，混入我们的工厂，压制我们的码头工人。而现在这些坏分子被肃清了，我们的城市居民真正地解放了。现在我们的工人带着轻快的心情工作。他们以新的活力处理着他们的问题，决心要永远保护着他们的家和工厂，并提高生产。
    这个群众运动也进一步解放了农民。他们清除了那些放火焚烧庄稼，那些以为暗杀农村政治干部便可以推翻革命的，暗藏着的从事阴谋活动的封建残余分子。现在，土地安全了，农民组织起来保卫着它。现在，他们能够全心进行生产。这在比较新近解放的地区尤其是一个新的经验。
    中国人民看到他们自己的成就，同时也认识镇压反革命分子是一个长期斗争。只要帝国主义存在一天，只要还有一个基地，从那里这些罪犯还可以得到供应，还可以被送进来危害我们人民的国土，那末，这个斗争必定存在一天。因此我们的政策是：永远警惕；对于那些和帝国主义及反动派完全割断关系，真诚悔改他们的罪行的特务分子，人民仍旧可以宽大对待；但对于那些继续双手沾染人民鲜血的分子，我们将无情地搜捕并消灭他们。
    总之，这个运动是帝国主义和封建主义分子的又一个重大失败。在我们几万万人民中，他们所能罗致去作他们的卑鄙勾当的，只是少数长期为非作歹的流氓。然而人民已控制了情势。我们内部力量增长了，我国掌握在人民手中有了保障了，这样我们对于我国的前途，同样对于确保世界和平，又作了一次英明的更大的贡献。
  抗美援朝保家卫国
    今天抗美援朝保家卫国这个群众运动已深入到中国人民的日常生活中。这个运动是中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会发动的，因为保卫世界和平是与一个帝国主义侵略者的实际威胁分不开的。这个伟大的爱国运动把我们祖国的安全和平。反对武装日本和西德，和要求五大国缔结和平公约联系起来。它使中国人民，和朝鲜人民并肩站在保卫和平的最前线。
    我们援助朝鲜是很自然的。首先，我们两个国家已有几千年的历史关系。在近代，在抗日战争期间，我们的关系尤其密切。那时，像现在一样，我们两个民族有共同的帝国主义敌人。许多朝鲜人民的子弟参加了我们遐迩闻名的八路军，他们中间有许多人为中国的解放献出了他们的生命。所以，我们的同志情谊是根深蒂固的。
    其次，北朝鲜是一个人民的国家。因而它也是世界和平阵营的一部分。我们不能坐在一旁漠不关心，眼看着战争贩子把它吞并。
    还有一个理由是：中国人民完全熟悉那个“首先占朝鲜”的策略。我们以最深的愤恨，回想到日本军阀是沿着同样一条道路来侵犯我们的东北的。
    所以，我们前面只有一条路——帮助我们的邻邦，同时也就是帮助我们自己以及世界和平事业。我们发起了抗美援朝的群众运动，全国像一个人似的动作起来。我们给前线以人力的支援，我们的志愿军以令人鼓舞的英雄主义告诉侵略者，他们对于他们疯狂的破坏是要负责任的。我们给前线以物资的支援，同时进行增产运动和巨大的捐献运动。我们的人民在他们全部历史中从没有这样迅速和有力的行动起来。这方面的一个例子，就是通过劳动竞赛，以增加生产。劳动竞赛本身就是一个群众运动，通过爱国公约的媒介它已经普遍推行全国。
    中国的工人阶级明白：前线的战士和后方工作台跟前的工人是密切相连的，工厂也是一个战场。所以，他们为增加生产，减低成本，提高质量而战斗。这个运动，据最近的统计，包括二百二十三万工人订了爱国公约，一一、一五九个小组响应了马恒昌小组。这个运动已扩展到各种各样的工厂和企业中。
    中国的工人同时也表明他们是新世纪的创造者。劳动竞赛运动不但是推动抗美援朝运动的一个原动力，而且也为中国将来的工业化做了准备。工人和技术人员不再不经批判研究就接受旧方法和旧制度了。现在他们把过去的秩序颠倒过来，他们成了机器的主人。他们以科学的革命的态度来考虑提高生产水平的问题，把旧事物的好的部分保留下来，孜孜不倦地寻求新的方法。此外，为了个人利益而留一手的旧思想也被抛弃了。今天，新发明必须为人民服务，传布到别的部门和工厂去，愈广泛愈好。这种观点使整个工人阶级团结得更紧，同时也形成了一种更有效地把体力劳动的技巧和创造性结合起来的新型工人。这也使工人们很快提升到行政的职位。例如，去年在矿山中有近七千的矿工成了科长、技师和行政人员。
    生产增加就可以有更多的物资拿去支援前线，工人的生活也同时以令人兴奋的速度得到改善。没有通货膨胀来掠夺他们的工资，他们吃穿都更好了，住屋的情况也改进了。劳动保险所规定的医药和其他福利事业正逐渐地扩大到更多的工人身上。工作环境的安全和卫生不断地提高。还有，不但工人的子女们能上学，工人们自己也能通过日益增多的文教机构来补偿他们过去的损失。总而言之，我们工人们的生活完全变了，在工场里，也在他们的家里。
    这种情形之所以能在今日的中国实现是因为在我们的国家，劳动受到尊敬，做工的人是主人翁。这已在政治上教育了我们的工人。通过劳动竞赛，他们表现了他们对国际主义精神和原则的了解，知道这如何是保家卫国的工作的一部分。
    直接支援前线的捐献运动也表示了新中国的力量。我们可以看出来，我们不仅有能力改善人民的生活，我们也能够把大炮和子弹，坦克和飞机，送到我们的战士手中，让他们拿来保卫和平。我们已谈到了工人们怎样在贡献他们的力量。但是农民也在增产捐献。非生产的工人——教员，店员，救济工作者，文化工作者——都能够做些额外工作或捐款支援前线。到现在为止，捐献已达到二、四八二架飞机的成绩，此外还有大量的大炮、高射炮和坦克。
    在这个伟大的抗美援朝运动中，前方和国内的事实显示出，“新的，觉悟了的亚洲”这话的意义。这些事实证明最强大的一个帝国主义，虽然有一群仆从国家在帮凶，还是可以完全被打败的。斗争尽管是长期的，尽管是艰巨的，但它的结果毫无疑问，中朝人民会赢得这场战争。这是为我们的生存以及为全人类的幸福的一个正义的战争。
  结论
    土地改革，镇压反革命分子，抗美援朝、保家卫国运动——这三个伟大的群众运动，使我们的人民共和国的最初两年成为历史中最最辉煌的两年。我们已经把我们的力量添加到为和平的斗争中去，并且给了和平的主要敌人以重大打击。我们已经用我们的力量去加强所有亚洲民族争取独立的斗争。值此我们的人民共和国二周年纪念之时，让我们记得这些重大的成就，同时准备前进的下一步。
