    Rejecting the Promotion of Workers' Advanced Production Experience is a Serious Mistake

    According to the Tianjin Daily: Leading cadres of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory lack the thought of relying on workers to run the factory well, and ignore and reject the promotion of workers' advanced production experience. Wang Deshan, a weaving worker at the factory, has never produced a single substandard cloth in the two years since liberation, a rare achievement in the country. The North China Textile Administration has repeatedly instructed the factory to summarize and promote Wang Deshan's work methods in a timely manner, but the factory's leading cadres turned a deaf ear. When Wang Deshan himself summarized his work methods, he did not receive help and guidance from the administrative leaders and technicians, which resulted in his advanced experience not being promoted in a timely manner, and the factory still produces a lot of substandard cloth in production, and the product quality has not been improved.

    Some leading cadres of the factory have a bureaucratic work style, and they do not accept well-intentioned criticisms and assistance from all parties. After the Tianjin Daily criticized the factory for increasing substandard cloth, Zhang Chen, the deputy director of the factory, not only failed to deeply examine and rely on employees to overcome shortcomings, but instead attacked the correspondent who wrote the article. This bad practice of suppressing criticism is the same as the bad phenomenon of ignoring workers' advanced experience.

    All leading cadres of state-owned factories, especially the party member cadres among them, must establish the basic idea of relying on the working class to run enterprises well. To this end, they must cherish and promote all advanced experiences and new initiatives among workers. This is a decisive link in running enterprises well. The mistakes made by the leading cadres of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Textile Factory are serious. The higher-level leading organs of the factory should immediately conduct an in-depth inspection of the factory's work, come up with solutions, and publish them in the newspaper to educate comrades in other business departments.

### 拒绝推广工人的先进生产经验是严重的错误

    拒绝推广工人的先进生产经验是严重的错误
    据天津日报载：国营天津棉纺二厂领导干部缺乏依靠工人办好工厂的思想，漠视和拒绝推广工人的先进生产经验。该厂织布工人王德山，解放两年来从未出过一匹次布，这样的成绩在国内是很少有的。华北纺织管理局曾再三指示该厂，及时总结并推广王德山的工作法，但该厂领导干部竟置若罔闻。王德山自己总结他的工作法时，也没有得到行政领导上和技术人员的帮助和指导；致使他的先进经验没有得到及时推广，该厂至今生产中仍然出很多次布，产品质量始终无法提高。
    该厂某些领导干部存在着官僚主义作风，他们对于各方善意的批评和帮助不加接受。在天津日报批评该厂次布增多之后，该厂副厂长张忱，不仅不深刻检讨并依靠职工克服缺点，反而打击写稿的通讯员。这种压制批评的恶劣作风，同漠视工人先进经验的恶劣现象如出一辙。
    一切国营工厂的领导干部，特别是其中的党员干部必须树立依靠工人阶级办好企业的基本思想，为此就必须十分珍视和推广工人间的一切先进经验和新倡议，这是办好企业的决定一环。国营天津纺织二厂的领导干部所犯的错误是严重的。该厂的上级领导机关应立即深入检查该厂工作，得出解决办法，并在报纸上公布，以教育其他企业部门的同志。
