Xinhua News Agency, October 28th dispatch: Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam dispatch: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communique on October 21 stating that in the two weeks from September 25th to October 10th, the Vietnam People's Army repelled two large-scale "mopping-up operations" by the French colonial army in the area east of the Red River, and intensified activities in other war zones, especially the Northwest war zone.

The communique stated: By October 10th, in the ten-day battle in the Northwest war zone, the People's Army annihilated more than 1,100 enemy officers and soldiers, including Major Chiradan, commander of the enemy's Righteous Land Subdivision; captured approximately 200 people, most of whom were Europeans, including three lieutenants and five second lieutenants; and seized one 70mm cannon, one 37mm cannon, 40 machine guns and submachine guns, six mortars, 200 rifles, three radio transmitters, 12 tons of ammunition, and a large amount of other equipment.

Regarding the fighting in the Red River Delta region, the communique stated: "The local People's Army, in cooperation with the militia and guerrillas, actively intercepted the enemy several times in the provinces of Bac Ninh, Bac Giang, Ha Dong, and Ninh Binh, who were attempting to loot and destroy the rice harvest. On October 15th, the People's Army intercepted a company of enemy troops in Ha Dong province, killing and wounding 70 enemy soldiers and seizing 28 machine guns and submachine guns, as well as many rifles."

The communique concluded: In the first two weeks of this month, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated 2,500 enemy soldiers on various battlefields in North Vietnam, including eight European and African companies, and crushed the enemy's "mopping-up operations."

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th dispatch: The British imperialist war of aggression against the Malayan people is being met with increasingly powerful blows from the Malayan People's Armed Forces.

Following the killing of British High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya, Sir Henry Gurney, by the Malayan National Liberation Army on October 6th, the British army mobilized four regiments of troops and numerous police to conduct in-depth searches in jungle areas and indiscriminately bombarded them with large numbers of aircraft and artillery in retaliation, but did not achieve its objectives. According to a Singapore dispatch from the United Press, they were only able to discover "a few tents and some footprints" of the Malayan National Liberation Army.

Subsequently, on October 22nd, in Selangor state, where Gurney was ambushed, a British army unit was ambushed again by the Malayan National Liberation Army, resulting in 15 deaths (including one captain) and 18 injuries.

According to a Prague dispatch from the Telegraf Agency, British newspapers expressed particular alarm at this attack on the British army. The London "Times" published the news on the 24th, calling it "the most ferocious ambush" since the beginning of the Malayan war. The Singapore correspondent of the British Conservative Party newspaper "Daily Telegraph" wrote that the recent military situation in Malaya shows that the Malayan National Liberation Army has "well executed the order to intensify military activities after October 15th." The "military operations to clear the Malay Peninsula of guerrillas state by state have not been successful," and the guerrillas' activities "have instead increased and become stronger due to their improved techniques."

    北越人民军
    两周内歼敌二千五
    马来亚人民武装继续痛击英军
    【新华社二十八日讯】越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总部十月二十一日发表公报称，在九月二十五日到十月十日的两周中，越南人民军部队在红河以东区域击退了法国殖民军两次大规模的“扫荡战”，并在其他战区特别是西北战区加强活动。
    公报说：到十月十日为止，在西北战区所进行的十天战斗中，人民军共歼灭了敌军官兵一千一百余人，内有义陆分区敌军司令季拉丹少校；俘掳约二百人，大部分是欧洲人，其中包括三个中尉和五个少尉；缴获七十公厘大炮一门、三十七公厘大炮一门、机枪和手提机枪四十挺、迫击炮六门、步枪二百支、无线电机三部、弹药十二吨和大量其他装备。
    关于红河三角洲地区的战斗，公报说：“人民军地方部队在和民兵及游击队的合作之下，在北宁、北江、河东、宁平各省积极截击了好几次想要劫掠与破坏稻米收获的敌人。十月十五日，人民军在河东省截击敌军一连，击毙击伤敌军七十人，缴获机枪和手提机枪二十八挺，以及许多步枪。”
    公报最后说：在本月的头两周中，越南人民军部队在北越各战场共歼灭敌军二千五百人，包括欧洲籍和非洲籍的八个连，并粉碎了敌人的“扫荡战”。
    【新华社二十八日讯】英帝国主义对马来亚人民的侵略战争，正遭到马来亚人民武装力量的日益有力的打击。
    英国驻马来亚联合邦高级专员格尔奈在十月六日被马来亚民族解放军击毙后，英军为了报复，曾调动陆军四个团和许多警察深入丛林地区搜索，并出动大批飞机、大炮滥肆轰击，但并没有达到目的。据合众社新加坡的消息承认，他们所能发现的却只是马来亚民族解放军的“几个帐篷和若干足迹而已”。
    接着在十月二十二日，就在格尔奈被伏击的雪兰莪州，一支英军部队又遭马来亚民族解放军的伏击，被击毙十五人（包括上尉一名），击伤十八人。
    据电通社布拉格消息：英国报纸对于英军这次的被袭击特别表示惊恐。伦敦“泰晤士报”二十四日刊载了这个消息，称之为马来亚战争开始以来的
    “一次最凶狠的伏击”。英国保守党的报纸“每日电讯报”驻新加坡记者写道：马来亚最近的军事情况表明，马来亚民族解放军已“很好地执行了在十月十五日以后加紧进行军事活动的命令”。“逐州肃清马来半岛游击队的军事扫荡行动不但没有成功”，游击队的活动“反而日益增加，并且由于他们的技术改进而变得更坚强了”。
