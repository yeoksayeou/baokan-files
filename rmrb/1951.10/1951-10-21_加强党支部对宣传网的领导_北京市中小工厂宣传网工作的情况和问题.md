Strengthening the Party Branch's Leadership over the Propaganda Network
    — The Situation and Problems of Propaganda Network Work in Small and Medium-Sized Factories in Beijing
    Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    According to recent statistics, among the 73 Party branches in small and medium-sized factories in the nine districts of Beijing, 62 branches have established propaganda networks, with 357 propagandists, including 196 Party members, 123 Communist Youth League members, and 38 non-Party people. The number of propagandists accounts for slightly less than 0.6% of the total number of employees in small and medium-sized factories in the city.

    Currently, propaganda networks in small and medium-sized factories can be divided into four types:

    The first type: The propagandists are very active, and the propaganda work can penetrate people's hearts, truly solving ideological problems for the masses and strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses. For example, in the Liberation Printing Factory, the relationship between the Party and the masses was originally very poor, and the masses often did things behind the backs of Party members. However, since the establishment of the propaganda network, and after the Party branch grasped the key link of "doing a good job in propaganda work," through movements such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, formulating and revising patriotic pacts, increasing production and making donations, the estrangement between the Party and the masses was eliminated. The opinions and problems of the masses can also be promptly reflected to the branch. The propagandists have become the core of all mass activities. They not only solve current affairs learning problems for the masses but also help them solve production problems, Party membership problems, life problems, and even wage problems. Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League cadres generally responded: "Now there is communication between the top and bottom," and "work is much easier to do."

    The second type: The propagandists are very active, and the propaganda work appears very active on the surface; but the work is not thorough, and the actual effect is not great. For example, in the state-owned Automobile Repair Factory, people read newspapers every day; the content of the blackboard newspaper and Q&A column is also frequently changed; drama troupes and singing groups also have frequent activities. However, the work is superficial and cannot or rarely can solve the ideological problems of the masses or promote production work. According to the propagandists' own statistics, only about one-third of the masses in a production team have close contact with the propagandists, and many masses do not even know that the factory has established propagandists.

    The third type: Propaganda work has not yet become a regular activity. There is little difference between after the establishment of the propaganda network and before the establishment of the propaganda network. For example, the Fine Arts Printing Factory of the News Photography Bureau has never been able to get rid of the situation of "propaganda only during movements." The factory has more than 300 workers, and the only propaganda tool is a few blackboard newspapers with unclear central content. The Red Star Iron Factory has only one blackboard newspaper. Although propagandists account for one-tenth of the total number of people in the factory, they cannot carry out work regularly. According to statistics, among the nine branches in the eighth district that have established propaganda networks, seven branches only move when they are pushed.

    The fourth type: The political atmosphere in the factory is not strong, and the propaganda network has little effect. For example, in the New China No. 2 Printing Factory, when the city enthusiastically commemorated the "May 1st" Labor Day, the branch put aside the work of publicizing the "May 1st" Labor Day and only held an anniversary celebration for the establishment of the factory for one year; the propagandists and Party members sang Peking opera but forgot to do political propaganda. When the Fuxing Flour Mill revised the patriotic pact, it was simply arranged among the trade union cadres without any propaganda work, resulting in a very poor revision.

    Among the above four types, the first type is a very small minority, the second and third types are more common, and the fourth type is also less common.

    When the central government announced the decision to establish a propaganda network, the People's Daily editorial "An Important Key to Strengthening the Ties Between the Party and the Masses" clearly pointed out: "Once such a propaganda network is universally established nationwide, the ties between our Party and the broad masses of the people will be strengthened a hundredfold. It will ensure that our Party's propaganda work can be carried out to the people at any time and any place. This is precisely the basic requirement of the Party's propaganda work." If we use this requirement as a standard to measure the propaganda network work in small and medium-sized factories, then only the first type of branch meets this requirement. This situation shows that it is necessary to quickly improve the second and third types and immediately change the fourth type. That is to say, it is necessary to: 1. Strengthen ideological work and overcome the shortcomings of propaganda work being superficially lively but having no concrete achievements in essence. 2. Combine propaganda work with various specific daily tasks to make it a regular activity and eliminate the phenomenon of "propaganda only during movements." 3. Resolutely overcome the tendencies of liberalism and commandism in not doing propaganda work to the masses.

    In improving the work of the propaganda network, one issue that cannot be ignored is to strengthen the branch's leadership over the propaganda network. Because the branch's poor leadership is the fundamental reason for the slow progress of the propaganda network work.

    At present, only the first type of branch has established a relatively systematic leadership and management of the propaganda network work. It can regularly discuss the work of the propaganda network at branch committee meetings, make plans, arrange, and check the work of propagandists on time, convene propagandist meetings, grasp the basic links of propaganda work, pay attention to collecting and studying the ideological situation of the masses, and lead mass propaganda organizations to carry out in-depth ideological education work together.

    Although the second type of branch has established relatively regular leadership and management work, it can arrange and check the work of propagandists on time and convene propagandist meetings; but all these things are done by the branch's propaganda committee member alone, and the branch secretary has not provided leadership and assistance. In addition, the established leadership work has not achieved the due results because it has ignored the investigation and research of the ideological situation of the masses and the leadership of mass propaganda organizations.

    The third and fourth types of branches do not have regular leadership work and fixed leadership systems. Except for when it is unavoidable, they rarely discuss various issues of the propaganda network at branch committee meetings, have no work plans, and cannot arrange, check the work of propagandists, and convene propagandist meetings on time. According to statistics, among the four branches in the first district that have established propaganda networks, none has adhered to the working system. Among the seven branches in the seventh district that have established propaganda networks, six branches cannot make work plans every month according to the regulations of the district committee's propaganda department. Among them, the Li'an Iron Factory has only held one propagandist meeting from April to now.

    It is not difficult to see that, except for the first type of branch, the leadership of other branches is very weak, and they have not fully implemented or have not implemented at all the various leadership tasks stipulated in the central government's decision to establish a propaganda network.

    Although there are many reasons for the weak leadership of the branch, such as many factories not having cadres who are detached from production and specialize in Party work, and some branches being formed by Party members from several factories with different situations; the main reason is that there are many errors in leadership thinking, and they have not actively and proactively overcome difficulties.

    According to our investigation, some comrades often put production work and propaganda work in opposition to each other, and even believe that only by reducing propaganda work can they concentrate on production work. The branch secretary of the Fine Arts Printing Factory of the News Photography Bureau once said: "The printed materials we produce are propaganda materials themselves, which are more important than our propaganda work." "Administrative work is busy, and production often goes wrong, so it is natural for propaganda work to be neglected somewhat." Some comrades do not understand why it is necessary to establish a propaganda network. For example, a branch secretary of the Road Engineering Office once said that it is also possible not to establish a propaganda network. Some comrades do not know the difference between propagandists and general mass propaganda organizations in terms of politics and organization, and they think that propagandists are similar to general propaganda workers. The branch of the New Flour Mill No. 1 has never held propagandist meetings separately or arranged and checked the work of propagandists, which has reduced the propagandists to the level of general propaganda workers and gradually lost their backbone role. In addition, some comrades are still accustomed to treating propaganda work as the work of a small number of people. Some comrades' understanding of the tasks of propagandists is very simple, believing that the only task of propagandists is to publicize current events.

    The above situation shows that strengthening the branch's leadership over the propaganda network must start from two aspects at the same time: on the one hand, improving organizational leadership; on the other hand, improving cadres' ideological understanding. In the future, the district committee should assist the branch in: 1. conscientiously implementing the central government's decision to establish a propaganda network, opposing the tendency of some cadres not paying attention to propaganda work, and criticizing various erroneous understandings and their roots—empiricism—among some cadres. 2. Establishing a systematic leadership and management work for the propaganda network, establishing a system of regularly studying the political and ideological situation inside and outside the Party, and cooperating with all parties to gradually solve other problems (such as cadre problems).

    The specific leadership of the district committee over the branch is very important. Without the specific leadership of the district committee over the branch, it is very difficult for the branch leadership to make effective improvements.

    In the leadership work of the propaganda network, the district committee has already done two things: 1. Arranging work. 2. Giving reports to propagandists. However, on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings to varying degrees: 1. Lack of regular systematic work inspection. 2. Failure to seriously use the method of making a breakthrough at one point, gaining experience, and guiding other units to help the branch overcome specific difficulties. 3. Poor ideological leadership. Some districts have not even led the branch to study the central government's decision to establish a propaganda network. The long-term existence of these shortcomings has, on the one hand, made it impossible to solve various problems in the branch in a timely manner, and on the other hand, has made it impossible for the district committee itself to break free from the so-called "no experience" and "not knowing how to lead the propaganda network" situation.

    The district committee should earnestly pay attention to improving the above shortcomings: 1. Establish a systematic and comprehensive work inspection system, put forward guiding improvement opinions in a timely manner, and guide the overall work. 2. Immediately start key training work, gradually enrich leadership experience, and help each branch solve specific problems. 3. Strengthen the investigation and research of the ideological situation of the masses, pay attention to the improvement of propaganda content, and strengthen the ideological leadership of the branches. Without these improvements, specific leadership is out of the question.

    Like the district committee's leadership over the branch, the municipal committee's specific leadership over the district committee is also very important. In the past, the leadership work of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee was not sound enough. First of all, there was no systematic management work. Secondly, there was a lack of specific guidance in the progress of the work. This point must be mentioned and paid attention to when checking and summarizing the propaganda network work.

    The total number of workers in small and medium-sized factories in the city is about the same as that in large state-owned factories, and it is very important to conduct regular propaganda work among them. Therefore, the propaganda network work must be improved a step further.

    加强党支部对宣传网的领导
    ——北京市中小工厂宣传网工作的情况和问题
    中共北京市委宣传部
    据最近统计，北京市城内九个区的七十三个中、小工厂党的支部中，已有六十二个支部建立了宣传网，现有宣传员三百五十七人，其中党员一百九十六人，团员一百二十三人，群众三十八人。宣传员人数占全市中、小工厂职工总数的百分之零点六弱。
    目前，中、小工厂的宣传网可以分做四个类型：
    第一类，宣传员很活跃，宣传工作能够深入人心，真正做到了替群众解决思想问题，密切了党和群众的联系。例如，解放印刷厂，本来党和群众关系很不好，群众有事常常背着党员做。但自从建立了宣传网，党支部抓住了“做好宣传工作”这一环节以后，经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、订立和修订爱国公约、增产捐献等运动，党和群众之间的隔膜消除了，群众的意见和问题也能及时反映到支部来了，宣传员成了一切群众活动的核心，他们不仅要替群众解决时事学习问题，而且要帮助群众解决生产问题、入党问题、生活问题，甚至是工资问题。党、政、工、团的干部普遍反应：“这回上下可通气了”，“工作好做多了”。
    第二类，宣传员很积极，从表面上看，宣传工作也很活跃；但工作不深入，实际作用不大。例如，国营汽车修理厂，每天有人读报；黑板报、问答栏的内容也经常改变；话剧团、歌咏队也常有活动。但是工作很肤浅，不能或很少能解决群众的思想问题、推动生产工作。据宣传员自己统计，在一个生产组内与宣传员联系较密切的群众仅有三分之一左右，许多群众还不知道该厂已经设立了宣传员。
    第三类，宣传工作还没有成为经常性的工作，建立宣传网以后和建立宣传网以前所差无几。例如，新闻摄影局美术印刷工厂，一直就没有摆脱“有运动，才有宣传”的状况。全厂三百多工人，唯一的宣传工具就是几块中心内容不明确的黑板报。红星铁工厂，只有一块黑板报，宣传员虽占全厂人数的十分之一，却不能经常进行工作。据统计，在第八区已经建立了宣传网的九个支部中，有七个支部是推一推，才动一动的。
    第四类，厂内政治空气不浓，宣传网作用不大。例如，新华印刷二厂，在全市热烈纪念“五一”节时，支部把宣传“五一”节的工作抛在一边，仅仅开了一个建厂一周年的纪念会；宣传员和党员唱了京戏，却忘记了做政治性的宣传。福兴面粉厂在修订爱国公约时，只是简单地在工会干部中布置一下，没有任何宣传工作，结果修订的很不好。
    在以上四个类型中，第一类是极少数的，第二类、第三类较多，第四类亦较少。
    在中央公布建立宣传网的决定时，人民日报社论
    “密切党和群众联系的一个重要关键”一文，曾明确指出：“这样的宣传网，一旦在全国范围内普遍建立起来，我们党和广大人民群众的联系就将百倍的密切了。它将保证我们党的宣传工作能够随时随地向人民群众来进行。这也正是党的宣传工作的基本要求。”如果用这个要求做标准，衡量一下中、小工厂的宣传网工作，那么只有第一类型的支部才符合这个要求。这种情况说明：必须迅速提高第二类、第三类并立即改变第四类的状况。这就是说必须：一、加强思想工作，克服宣传工作中表面上轰轰烈烈，实质上没什么具体成就的缺点。二、使宣传工作与日常的各种具体工作结合起来，成为经常性的工作，消灭“有运动，才有宣传”的现象。三、坚决克服不向群众做宣传工作的自由主义和命令主义倾向。
    在提高宣传网的工作中，有一个不容忽视的问题，就是要加强支部对宣传网的领导。因为支部领导不好是使宣传网工作迟迟不前的根本原因。
    在目前，仅仅第一类支部、对宣传网的工作建立了比较系统的领导和管理。能够经常在支委会上讨论宣传网的工作，能够按时做计划、布置、检查宣传员的工作，召开宣传员会议，抓住宣传工作的基本环节，注意搜集、研究群众的思想情况，并能领导群众性的宣传组织，一起进行深入的思想教育工作。
     第二类支部虽然建立了比较经常的领导和管理工作，能够按时布置、检查宣传员的工作，召开宣传员会议；但所有这些事情都只是支部宣传委员一个人搞，支部书记未加以领导帮助。此外，又因忽略了群众思想情况的调查、研究，忽略了对群众性宣传组织的领导，使已经建立起来的领导工作，没有取得应有的成果。
    第三、四类支部，没有经常的领导工作和固定的领导制度，除不得已，很少在支委会上讨论宣传网的各种问题，没有什么工作计划，不能按时布置、检查宣传员的工作和召开宣传员会议。据统计，在第一区已经建立了宣传网的四个支部中，没有一个支部坚持了工作制度。在第七区已经建立了宣传网的七个支部中，有六个支部不能按照区委宣传部的规定，每月做出工作计划，其中立安铁工厂自四月份到现在只开过一次宣传员会议。
    不难看出，除第一类支部外，其他支部的领导是很薄弱的，是没有充分执行或根本没有执行中央建立宣传网的决定中所规定的各项领导任务的。
    支部领导薄弱的原因虽然很多，如许多工厂没有脱离生产、专做党的工作的干部，有些支部是由几个情况各异的工厂中的党员合组而成的；但主要的还是因为领导思想有许多错误，没有主动地积极地克服困难。
    据我们的调查，有些同志还常把生产工作和宣传工作对立起来，甚至认为只有减少宣传工作，才能专力搞生产工作，新闻摄影局美术印刷工厂的支部书记曾说：“我们出的印刷品本身就是宣传品，比我们的宣传工作还重要。”“行政工作忙，生产上又常出错，宣传工作被忽视一些是自然的。”有些同志还不了解为什么要建立宣传网。如道路工程事务所某分支书记曾表示，不建立宣传网也可以。有些同志还不知道宣传员在政治上、组织上与一般群众性宣传组织的区别，认为宣传员和一般宣传工作者差不多。新建面粉一厂支部向来不单独召开宣传员会议、布置与检查宣传员工作，这样就使宣传员降低到一般宣传工作者的水平，逐渐失掉其骨干作用。此外，有些同志还习惯于把宣传工作当作一部分人的工作。有些同志对宣传员任务的理解很简单，认为宣传员唯一的任务就是宣传时事。
    以上情况说明，加强支部对宣传网的领导必须从两方面同时着手：一方面是改善组织领导，一方面是提高干部思想认识。今后区委应协助支部：一、认真贯彻中央建立宣传网的决定，反对部分干部不重视宣传工作的倾向，批判部分干部中各种错误认识及其根源——经验主义。二、建立对宣传网的系统的领导和管理工作，树立定期研究党内、外政治思想情况的制度，并与各方面配合，逐步解决其他问题（如干部问题）。
    区委对支部的具体领导是非常重要的，没有区委对支部的具体领导，支部领导要作有效的改进是很困难的。
    在宣传网的领导工作中，区委已经做了两件事：一、布置工作。二、为宣传员做报告。但另一方面在不同的程度上还存在着不少的缺点：一、缺乏经常的系统的工作检查。二、没有认真的使用突破一点，取得经验，指导其他单位的方法，帮助支部克服具体困难。三、思想领导差，有些区甚至没有领导支部学习中央建立宣传网的决定。这些缺点的长期存在，一方面使支部中各种问题没有得到及时解决，另一方面也使区委本身总不能由所谓“没有经验”“不知道怎样领导宣传网”的状况中解脱出来。
    区委应切实注意改进以上缺点：一、建立系统的全面的工作检查制度，及时提出方针性的改进意见，指导全面工作。二、立即着手进行重点培养工作，逐步丰富领导经验，帮助各支部解决具体问题。三、加强对群众思想情况的调查、研究，注意宣传内容的改进，加强对支部的思想领导。没有这些改进，具体领导是谈不到的。
    和区委对支部的领导一样，市委对区委的具体领导也很重要。过去，市委宣传部的领导工作是不够健全的。首先，没有进行系统的管理工作。其次，在工作进行中缺乏具体指导，在检查和总结宣传网工作时这点是必须提及并引起注意的。
    全市中、小工厂的工人总数，和大的公营工厂差不多，在他们之间进行经常性的宣传工作非常重要。因此，宣传网工作必须提高一步。
