    Eternal Friendship with China
    -- Celebrating the Second Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
    Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl
    An important prerequisite for the great victory of the Chinese people was the Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler's Germany and the defeat of predatory imperialist Japan. The failure of German and Japanese imperialism in World War II strengthened the anti-fascist movement and gave a powerful impetus to China's national liberation movement. Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, said: "If there were no Soviet Union, if there were no victory of the anti-fascist Second World War, if there were no defeat of Japanese imperialism, if there were no emergence of the new democratic countries, if there were no oppressed nations of the East rising to fight, if there were no struggles between the masses of the people and the reactionary rulers in capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, if there were no synthesis of all these factors, then the international reactionary forces piled on top of us would certainly be many times greater than they are now. In such a situation, could we have won? Obviously not."
    The worker-peasant alliance, formed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and serving as the foundation of the new democratic system, has proven to be a great force, uniting all democratic classes and nationalities of the People's China and leading them to fight against the remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to strive for the establishment of an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous China.
    New China abolished all privileges of imperialist countries and nationalized the capital of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. New China also abolished the feudal land system and transferred land to the peasants.
    The victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution is a decisive and profound blow to the world imperialist system after the great October Socialist Revolution. The world camp of peace and democracy has been greatly consolidated and strengthened as a result. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese people over the forces of war and destruction is also a victory for the forces of peace throughout the world; it gives new inspiration to the international anti-imperialist movement, especially the anti-imperialist movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and strengthens their fighting power. It gives new courage and new hope to the people oppressed and trampled by imperialism.
    The great strength of the world peace camp, headed by the great Soviet Union and with People's China as one of its main pillars, far exceeds the strength of the imperialist camp, and this strength is growing day by day. This strength is the most reliable guarantee for maintaining peace; it can crush all imperialist aggression.
    Just as the founding of the People's Republic of China is not only a turning point in Chinese history but also a turning point in the history of the entire Asia, the founding of the German Democratic Republic is not only a turning point in German history but also a turning point in the history of the entire Europe. The people of our two countries understand this fact and the responsibilities we bear as a result.
    Both People's China and the German Democratic Republic have become places where large-scale construction is underway, where the working people are characterized by a new attitude towards labor, and where they are engaged in the struggle for a better life and for national independence and peace by launching emulation campaigns and activist movements.
    The German people pay close attention to the heroic struggle of the Chinese people because, as Mao Zedong said in his congratulatory message on the founding of the German Democratic Republic, "The people's Germany and the people's China are both at the forefront of the great struggle against imperialism."
    The victory of the Chinese people has strengthened the confidence of German patriotic forces in winning the struggle against the American and British imperialists, who, against the will of the German people, want to continue to forcibly occupy West Germany and to perpetuate the state of division of Germany caused by Hitler's war. The American and British imperialists want to maintain the division of Germany in order to launch a war against the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and the people's democratic countries in the future.
    It is very important to strengthen the permanent unity and friendship between the people of China and Germany. The peace-loving and democratic people of Germany know that they can learn a lot from the Chinese people, such as their spirit of courageous sacrifice and perseverance, and their tactics in fighting against the imperialists. Moreover, the consolidation of Sino-German friendship and the enhancement of economic and cultural relations between our two peoples are important factors in strengthening the world peace camp.
    Holding a German-Chinese Friendship Month is for this purpose, giving the German people the opportunity to become familiar with the progressive culture of the new China, which originates from thousands of years of great tradition, and it helps to develop the economic and political relations between our two peoples.
    At the beginning of the German-Chinese Friendship Month, Guo Moruo, a Chinese writer and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, on behalf of the Chinese people, said: I extend my brotherly greetings to the motherland of the two great leaders of the working class, Marx and Engels, to the talented German people, and to their leader, President Pieck. The German people express their heartfelt gratitude for this congratulation and pay high tribute to the heroically fighting Chinese people and their great leader Mao Zedong.
    The tasks of the German and Chinese people in the struggle against the warmongers are closely linked. Just as the German people are waging a fierce struggle against the re-militarization of Germany and the transformation of Germany into an aggressive base for the United States to attack the Soviet Union, the Chinese people are now mobilizing the nation's strength to fight against the re-militarization of Japan by American imperialism and the transformation of Japan into an aggressive base for American imperialism in Asia.
    The separate peace treaty with Japan, recently concluded under the sole manipulation of American imperialism without the participation of the Soviet Union and China—Japan's neighbors and countries that played the most significant role in the war against Japanese imperialism—is an alarm signal to the Chinese people and all peace-loving people. Other Asian countries, such as India and Burma, did not participate in the conclusion of this treaty either. Moreover, the Japanese people were not invited to participate. This so-called "peace treaty" was concluded by American and British war instigators and representatives of Japanese militarism, and it only serves the American imperialism's war preparations in Asia.
    What happened to Japan in San Francisco will inevitably fall on Germany in Washington in a different form. Agreements to include West Germany in American and British war plans and to openly restore German militarism have already been concluded, excluding Germany's eastern neighbors, especially the Soviet Union, and disregarding the clear will of the German people. The Washington Conference is a serious threat to all the German people. The common struggle against American imperialism marks the close connection between the policies and efforts of our two peoples.
    The German people greatly admire and respect the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers in assisting the Korean people in resisting the American imperialist's criminal aggression. They know that the purpose of the American aggression against Korea is to transform Korea into a forward base for attacking the People's Republic of China after conquering the Korean people. However, the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea shows that the bloody plans of the Wall Street warmongers are doomed to failure. Stalin's interview with the Pravda reporter said: "If Britain and the United States finally reject the peaceful proposals of the Chinese People's Government, then the Korean War can only end with the defeat of the interventionists."
    The common struggle against a common enemy requires us to strengthen political, economic, and cultural ties. Common economic interests also particularly demonstrate the consolidation of friendship between our two peoples. This common economic interest and successful economic cooperation are also reflected in the trade agreement signed between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic on October 10, 1950.
    The Sino-German trade agreement is of great significance to the economic recovery of the German Democratic Republic, and as outstanding Chinese friends have repeatedly emphasized, it will also be of important help to the gradual industrialization of People's China. The Sino-German trade agreement will accelerate the economic development of both countries and thus strengthen and develop the strength of the German and Chinese peoples.
    For the German people, the importance of trade relations between the two countries goes far beyond the borders of the German Democratic Republic. The vast majority of West German industrialists believe that the close friendship between the German Democratic Republic and People's China provides a basis and possibility for increasing and expanding all-German trade with China. This matter is very important for the relations between East and West Germany. It raises the prestige of the German Democratic Republic in West Germany and makes an important contribution to the struggle of the German people in the East and West to unite and strive for the establishment of a unified, independent, peace-loving and democratic Germany.
    The people of the German Democratic Republic know that the Chinese people have supplied them with important raw materials and food, thereby supporting the struggle of the German Democratic Republic to complete the Five-Year Plan, and know that the Chinese people have great confidence in the quality of our industrial products. Therefore, our workers, technicians, scientists, and engineers will make every effort in the spirit of true international solidarity to live up to this trust. They will do their best to promote economic cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China. They know that by doing so, they are strengthening the strength of the peace camp and causing the imperialist warmongers to suffer new defeats.
    The mutual relations between the peoples of the two countries are particularly manifested in cultural relations. The people of the German Democratic Republic are watching with great interest the development of the new democratic culture of the Chinese people, as well as their achievements in education, art, and literature. During the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival held in Berlin, the German people, especially the youth of East and West Germany, had the honor of seeing the performances of the youth of the People's Republic of China. The enthusiastic welcome of these performances by the German youth and the world youth proved the high cultural level of the Chinese people.
    The German people all know that Chinese literature and art workers have made great efforts in the victorious liberation struggle of the Chinese people. Chinese artists and writers faithfully and enthusiastically responded to Mao Zedong's call, calling on them to closely connect with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to create patriotic and militant literature. This literature has become an organic part of the revolutionary struggle, and has become a sharp weapon to help the people carry out a unified struggle against the enemy and consolidate the will to fight. In addition, Chinese writers have tirelessly studied the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and have confirmed their theoretical knowledge in the practice of participating in the revolutionary liberation struggle. In this way, they have been able to explain the political measures of the revolutionary organization to the fighting Chinese masses and provide the People's Liberation Army with the necessary assistance.
    Progressive folk art, which has grown out of the revolutionary struggle and originates from China's long-standing cultural traditions, is full of new content and points out the path to a bright future for the Chinese people.
    German artists and writers can learn a lot from this development process. At the same time, in order to help the German people successfully carry out the national struggle, if our two peoples can continuously increase the exchange of our experiences in studying and practicing Marxism-Leninism, if the German people, in addition to familiarizing themselves with the guiding theories of Lenin and Stalin, in addition to familiarizing themselves with the experience of Soviet scientists in building socialism, also familiarize themselves with Mao Zedong's theory and the experience gained by Chinese Marxist scientists in the struggle against imperialism and in the construction of new China, it is of great significance. This scientific and cultural exchange has already begun.
    Currently, a delegation from the German Democratic Republic has gone to China to sign an important cultural agreement. This agreement will help to further consolidate Sino-German friendship and will help German cultural workers to expand and develop their work for the benefit of the German people and for the struggle for peace.
    What the new China received from the Kuomintang regime was economic and political chaos. The Japanese and American imperialism carried out decades of brutal exploitation of China, which eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Chinese economy. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China two years ago, the Chinese people have made tremendous achievements in politics and economics. The many achievements made in the cause of building a people's democratic China are the result of the unprecedented and tremendous efforts of the Chinese people.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people completed the democratic revolution domestically, cleared out the spies of American imperialism, unified the country, and are moving powerfully and victoriously in the direction of realizing socialism.
    The German people feel that they are connected to the Chinese people, with a close and unbreakable friendship. The German people are proud that they are fighting side by side with such a great and strong nation in the invincible peace and democratic camp headed by the socialist Soviet Union to safeguard world peace. Long live the great and glorious Chinese people and their leader Mao Zedong!

    永远与中国友好
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国建国二周年
    德意志民主共和国总理  格罗提渥
    中国人民取得伟大胜利的重要先决条件是苏联的击溃希特勒德国及击溃掠夺成性的帝国主义日本。德日帝国主义者在第二次世界大战中的失败加强了反法西斯运动，并使中国的民族解放运动获得了强大的动力。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东说：“假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现，假如没有东方各被压迫民族正在起来斗争，假如没有美国、英国、法国、德国、意大利、日本等等资本主义国家内部的人民大众和统治他们的反动派之间的斗争，假如没有这一切的综合，那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。”
    在中国共产党领导下所形成的、作为新民主制度的基础的工农联盟，已经证明了是一个伟大的力量，它团结了人民中国的各民主阶级和各民族，并领导他们为反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的残余与争取建立独立、民主、和平、统一及富强的中国而斗争。
    新中国废除了帝国主义国家的一切特权，并把官僚资产阶级的资本收归国有，新中国还废除了封建的土地制度，把土地转交给农民。
    中国人民民主革命的胜利，是伟大的十月社会主义革命以后对于世界帝国主义体系具有决定性意义的沉重的打击。世界和平与民主阵营因此而大大地巩固与加强了。因此，中国人民战胜从事战争与破坏的势力的胜利同时也就是全世界和平力量的胜利；它使国际反帝国主义的运动，特别是殖民地与半殖民地国家的反帝国主义运动，得到新的鼓舞，加强了他们的战斗力量。它给被帝国主义压迫与蹂躏的人民以新的勇气和新的希望。
    以伟大的苏联为首而且人民中国是其中一个主要支柱的世界和平阵营，它的巨大的力量，远远超过了帝国主义阵营的力量，而且这个力量还在日益增长。这个力量是维护和平的最可靠的保证；它能粉碎一切帝国主义侵略。
    正像中华人民共和国的成立不仅是中国历史的转折点而且也是整个亚洲历史的转折点一样，德意志民主共和国的成立不仅是德国历史的转折点，而且是整个欧洲历史的转折点。我们两国人民都明了这种事实以及我们由此所担负起来的责任。
    人民中国与德意志民主共和国都已变成正在进行大规模建设的地方，这里劳动人民的特点是对于劳动有了新的态度，他们正在用开展竞赛运动和积极分子运动的办法，从事于争取更好的生活和争取民族独立与和平的斗争。
    德国人民非常注意中国人民的英勇斗争，因为，正如毛泽东在德意志民主共和国成立时的贺电中所说，“人民的德国和人民的中国同处在反对帝国主义的伟大斗争的最前线”。
    中国人民的胜利，加强了德国爱国势力对反对美英帝国主义者的斗争的胜利信心，美英帝国主义者违反德国人民的意志，要继续强行占领德国西部，并且要使希特勒战争所造成的德国的分裂状态永久维持下去。美英帝国主义要维持德国的分裂局面，是为了要在将来发动反对苏联、德意志民主共和国与各人民民主国家的战争。
    加强中德两国人民之间的永久团结与友谊，是很重要的。德国爱好和平与民主的人民知道，他们可以从中国人民那里学得很多东西，例如中国人民勇敢牺牲和坚忍不拔的精神，他们与帝国主义者进行斗争的战术等。而且，德中友谊的巩固与我们两国人民间的经济与文化关系的增进是加强世界和平阵营的重要因素。
    举行德中友好月，就是为了这个目的，这样使德国人民有机会熟悉了渊源于数千年伟大传统的新中国的进步文化，它帮助了发展我们两国人民间的经济与政治关系。
    德中友好月开始时，中国作家、世界和平理事会副主席郭沫若曾代表中国人民说：谨向两位伟大的工人阶级的领袖马克思与恩格斯的祖国、向多才多艺的德国人民和他们的领袖皮克总统致以兄弟的敬礼。德国人民对于这种祝贺表示衷心的感谢，并且向英勇斗争的中国人民和他们的伟大领袖毛泽东致以崇高的敬意。
    德国人民与中国人民在反对战争贩子的斗争中的任务是彼此密切关联着的。正像德国人民正在进行激烈的斗争，反对德国重新军国主义化与把德国变为美国进攻苏联的侵略基地一样，中国人民现在正在动员全国的力量为反对美帝国主义使日本重新军国主义化与把日本变为美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略基地而斗争。
    最近在美帝国主义的一手包办下，没有苏联与中国——日本的近邻、在反对日本帝国主义的战争中起了最重大作用的国家——的人民参加而缔结的单独对日和约，对于中国人民与全体爱好和平的人民来说，是一个警号。其他亚洲国家，如印度与缅甸，也没有参加缔结这个条约。而且，日本人民也没有被邀请参加。这个所谓“和约”是美英战争煽动者与日本军国主义的代表所缔结的，它只是服务于美帝国主义在亚洲的备战工作的。
    在旧金山对日本发生的事情，必将以不同的形式在华盛顿落在德国的头上。把西德包括进美英战争计划和公然恢复德国军国主义的协定已经在排斥德国的东方邻国，特别是苏联，并且不顾德国人民的明确意志的情况下订立起来了。华盛顿会议是对全德国人民的严重威胁。反对美帝国主义的共同斗争标志着我们两国人民的政策和努力之间的密切关连。
    德国人民对中国人民志愿军援助朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义罪恶侵略的英勇斗争，十分钦佩与敬仰。他们知道美国侵略朝鲜的目的是想在征服朝鲜人民以后把朝鲜变为进攻中华人民共和国的前进基地。但是，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的伟大胜利表明了：华尔街战争贩子的血腥计划是注定要失败的。斯大林对真理报记者的谈话说：“如果英国和美国终于拒绝了中国人民政府的和平建议，那么朝鲜战争便只能以干涉者的失败而告终。”
    反对共同敌人的共同斗争要求我们加强政治、经济和文化上的联系。共同的经济利益也特别表现出我们两国人民之间友谊的巩固。这种共同的经济利益和成功的经济合作也表现在一九五零年十月十日中华人民共和国与德意志民主共和国签订的贸易协定上。
    中德贸易协定对德意志民主共和国的经济复兴有很大意义，正如卓越的中国友人所不断着重指出的，它对人民中国的逐步工业化也将有重要的帮助。中德贸易协定将加速两国的经济发展，并因此而加强与发展中德两国人民的力量。
    对于德国人民来说，两国贸易关系的重要性远超出德意志民主共和国的疆界之外。西德广大的工业家都认为，德意志民主共和国与人民中国的密切友谊为增加和扩大全德国对中国的贸易提供了基础和可能性。这件事对东德和西德间的关系是非常重要的。它提高了德意志民主共和国在西德的威信，并且对德国东西部人民团结起来争取建立统一、独立、爱好和平和民主的德国的斗争，有重要的贡献。
    德意志民主共和国的人民知道，中国人民供给了他们以重要的原料和粮食，从而支持了德意志民主共和国争取完成五年计划的斗争，并且知道中国人民非常信赖我国工业产品的质量。因此，我国的工人、技术人员、科学家和工程师将本着真正国际团结的精神来尽一切努力，以求不辜负这种信赖。他们将尽其所能以促进德意志民主共和国与中华人民共和国之间的经济合作。他们知道，他们这样做就加强了和平阵营的力量，并且使帝国主义战争贩子遭受到新的失败。
    两国人民间的相互关系特别表现在文化关系方面。德意志民主共和国的人民以最大的兴趣注视着中国人民新民主主义文化的发展，以及他们在教育、艺术和文学等方面的成就。在柏林举行第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节时，德国人民，特别是东德和西德的青年有幸看到了中华人民共和国的青年的演出。这些演出所受到的德国青年及世界青年的热烈欢迎，证明了中国人民文化水平之高。
    德国人民都知道，中国的文学与艺术工作者在中国人民胜利的解放斗争中出了很大的力量。中国的艺术家与文学家忠诚热烈地响应毛泽东的号召，毛泽东号召他们密切联系工、农、兵群众，创造爱国的战斗的文学，这种文学已成为革命斗争中的一个有机部分，成为帮助人民进行一致的对敌斗争与巩固战斗意志的锐利武器。此外，中国作家坚持不懈地研究了马克思、恩格斯、列宁与斯大林的学说，并在参加革命的解放斗争的实践中证实了他们的理论知识。这样，他们就有能力向战斗的中国人民大众解释革命组织的政治措施并给人民解放军以必要的帮助。
    从革命斗争中成长起来的、渊源于中国悠久的文化传统的进步的人民艺术充满了新的内容，并且替中国人民指出了走向光明未来的道路。
    德国的艺术家与作家可以从这个发展过程中学到很多东西。同时，为了帮助德国人民成功地进行民族斗争，如果我们两国人民能够不断增加地交流我们彼此在研究与实践马克思主义——列宁主义方面的心得，如果德国人民除了熟悉列宁、斯大林的指导理论，除了熟悉苏联科学家建设社会主义的经验以外，同时也熟悉毛泽东的理论与中国的马克思主义科学家在反对帝国主义的斗争中、在新中国的建设中所获得的经验，那是有重大意义的。这种科学与文化的交流已经开始了。
    目前，德意志民主共和国的代表团已赴中国，以便签订一个重要的文化协定。这个协定将帮助德中友谊进一步巩固，将帮助德国的文化工作者为了德国人民的利益，为了和平斗争而扩大与展开他们的工作。
    新中国从国民党政权手中接收下来的东西是经济与政治上的一片混乱。日本和美国帝国主义对中国进行了数十年之久的残酷剥削，结果最后使中国经济陷于破产。中华人民共和国立国两年以来，中国人民在政治与经济上获得了巨大的成就。在建设人民的民主的中国的事业中所达到的这许多成绩是中国人民进行了空前的巨大努力的结果。
    中国人民在中国共产党与毛泽东主席的领导下在国内完成了民主革命，清除了国内的美帝国主义的间谍，统一了全国，并向着实现社会主义的方向强有力地、胜利地迈进。
    德国人民感到自己与中国人民心心相连，友好无间。德国人民引以自豪的是，他们与这样一个伟大而强盛的民族在以社会主义的苏联为首的无敌的和平民主阵营中为维护世界和平而并肩战斗着。伟大的光荣的中国人民和他们的领袖毛泽东万岁！
