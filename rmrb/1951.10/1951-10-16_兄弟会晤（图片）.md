    (4) It turns out that this year, Wu Jinxiang responded to the people's government's call to increase cotton production and planted five *dou* of cotton on his nine *dou* field (each *dou* field is approximately equal to one *mu*). Through deep plowing and careful cultivation, he increased the yield per *dou* of cotton field from 20 *jin* of lint cotton last year to 40 *jin*.
    (5) In order to save raw cotton, Zhou Guixiang once led all the workers in the workshop to establish a patriotic pact, which reduced the amount of returned cotton waste per day in the carding workshop from more than 80 pounds to more than 20 pounds. One actively increases cotton production, and the other tries to save raw materials as much as possible, working together to create the wealth of the motherland. Now, they have met.
    (6) In the spinning workshop, the farmer representatives were very interested in the rapidly rotating spindles. The farmer representative pulled the worker attendant and asked curiously about everything.

    （四）原来吴金祥今年响应人民政府增产棉花的号召，把自己九斗田种了五斗田（每斗田约等于一亩）的棉花，深耕细作，使每斗棉田产量由去年的二十斤皮棉提高到四十斤。
    （五）周桂香为了节约原棉，曾领导全车间工人订立爱国公约，使梳棉间全部钢丝车每天的回花数量由八十多磅减到二十多磅。一个积极增产棉花，一个尽量节约原料，共同为创造祖国的财富而努力，现在，他们见面了。
    （六）在细纱车间里，农民代表对飞速转动的纱锭十分感到兴趣。农民代表拉着工人招待员好奇地问长问短。
