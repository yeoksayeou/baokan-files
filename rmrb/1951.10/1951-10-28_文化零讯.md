	▲ To celebrate the 34th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the China Film Corporation will hold a "Soviet Film Exhibition" in 20 major cities across the country starting November 6th of this year.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has notified its local branches to assist in the exhibition work in their respective regions to ensure its smooth progress. A screening of "The Father of Russian Aviation" will be held on the evening of November 6th as a welcoming performance for the opening ceremony.
	▲ The China Film Corporation is continuously supplying news film footage from China to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries for rapid production and screening. The news film footage of Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling of the Central People's Government receiving the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace" in Beijing on September 18th has been airlifted to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other countries. Copies and footage of the documentaries "Frontier Guards" and "May Day Parade" have been sent to the Soviet Union.
	▲ The colorful documentary "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains," depicting China's great culture and scenery, has been adapted into Russian and other language versions by the China Film Corporation and the Soviet Film Export Company. The "New Beijing," "The Mighty Yangtze Flows Eastward," "Shanghai of the People," "Picturesque Scenery of Jiangnan," and "Liberated South" sections of the film have been sent to the Chinese embassies and diplomatic missions in Czechoslovakia, Romania, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and other countries for screening.
	▲ The film projection team of a certain unit of the Guangxi Military Region took the colorful film "Victory of the Chinese People" to the Yao Mountains and the 48 Ranges area for screenings, which were warmly welcomed by people of all ethnic groups. The projection team spent more than three months in the two mountain areas, giving more than 40 screenings in towns and villages in several counties, including Liujiang. Due to the high mountains, narrow roads, and inconvenient transportation, the local people of all ethnic groups automatically helped to lead the way and carry the equipment whenever they arrived; and militia were assigned to escort them. People often came in groups from 20, 30, or even 50 or 60 *li* away to watch the films.
	When the people of all ethnic groups saw the magnificent mountains and rivers of their motherland on the screen, they felt extremely excited. When the people's leader, Chairman Mao, appeared on the screen, a burst of enthusiastic applause and cheers rang out in the mountain villages.
	▲ The Northeast Film Studio is actively carrying out the translation and production of Soviet films this year. Films currently in production include "My Universities," "Government Member," "Rich Summer," "Excellent Party Member," "Daily Bread," and "The Story of the Golden Fish."
	▲ The Central People's Government's 1951 Autumn Basketball and Volleyball Tournament for directly affiliated organizations is scheduled to open today at 9:00 AM at the Labor People's Cultural Palace. Participating in the competition are four units: organizations directly under the Government Administration Council, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee, and the Cultural and Educational Affairs Committee, with a total of fifteen men's and women's basketball and volleyball teams. This tournament will select representatives for the Central People's Government's directly affiliated organizations.
	▲ The National Railway and North China Football Tournament will be held from October 28th to November 5th at the Xianongtan Beijing Public Stadium. Participating in the competition are seven representative teams from five provinces and two cities in North China and fourteen teams from the national railway system (including six teams from inside Shanhaiguan -- Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, Hengyang, Jinan, and directly affiliated teams -- and seven teams from outside Shanhaiguan). The North China region will adopt a round-robin format; the national railway system will adopt a group round-robin format, with the six teams from inside Shanhaiguan selecting a representative team to compete with the team from outside Shanhaiguan. Finally, a national railway representative team will be selected to participate in the National Football Tournament to be held in Tianjin at the end of November.
	▲ Hunan Province has launched a mass literacy campaign this autumn, mobilizing out-of-school youth in rural areas to enroll in schools to solve the shortage of secondary school students. There are now more than 90,000 students in secondary schools throughout the province, exceeding the Provincial Department of Culture and Education's plan to enroll 87,000 students; the number of secondary school students has increased by half compared to the previous semester.
