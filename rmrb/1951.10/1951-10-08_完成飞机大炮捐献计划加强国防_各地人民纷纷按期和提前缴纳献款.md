As of September 30th, the total donations deposited had reached over 23 billion yuan, exceeding the total value of purchasing fifteen fighter planes. After the Chinese People’s Resist America, Aid Korea General Branch issued three major patriotic appeals on June 1st, the district began formulating increased production and donation plans. In August, after the returning representatives of the Volunteers made reports in various parts of the district, the donation movement became even more enthusiastic. Since September, people in various regions have decided to complete the donation plan as a gift for National Day. Workers at the Xiangtan City Pig Bristle Factory adopted the bristle cleaning machine modified by Zhang Zhenyou, a model worker at the city's Machinery Factory, which increased production efficiency eighty times, increasing the factory's donation figure from 4 million yuan to 8.5 million yuan. After the harvest, farmers in various regions collectively paid donations of rice. In the 13th district of Xiangyin, more than 13,000 farmers collectively delivered donation grain, accounting for 30% of the district's population. Within three days, they donated more than 425,000 catties of grain, exceeding the original donation plan by more than 100,000 catties. The Xiangtan City business community held a meeting on September 26th and decided to donate 1.5 billion yuan by the end of the month, which was deposited in full by September 29th.

Farmers in the 20 counties in the district that have completed land reform have also enthusiastically paid donations with the new grain produced this year after the bumper harvest. Farmers in Yuechi County completed the payment task for three fighter planes before National Day. The people of Yilong County, which has very little industry and commerce, completed the payment task for the "Zhu De's Hometown" aircraft in one and a half months.

People from all walks of life in the district held collective large-scale donations on National Day, striving to complete and exceed the plan decided by the people of the district in August to increase the donation of two fighter planes, two cannons, and two anti-aircraft guns, as a greater gift to the motherland. To this end, the Chuanbei District People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and 13 political parties, organizations, and people's groups, including the Chinese Communist Party Chuanbei District Committee, jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on behalf of the more than 15 million people in the district to express their respect.

In recent days, more than 100,000 industrial and commercial households in the city have participated in collective payments, of which more than 6,000 industrial and commercial households have paid off all the pledged donations, and many industrial and commercial households have exceeded their predetermined donation targets. Some industrial and commercial households that have fully paid their donations have also pledged to strive to exceed their original donation plans. Industrial and commercial operators who have already paid half of their donations have proposed to pay off all their donations early, in order to challenge other industrial and commercial operators.
    People from all walks of life in Beijing launched a heated campaign to pay donations ahead of schedule before National Day. As of September 28th, the amount paid had reached more than 58 billion yuan, exceeding more than half of the total donation amount.

Baotou, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Dalian and other cities have completed more than 75% of the six-month payment task.
    In the payment of donations, some cities have launched a patriotic upsurge of collective payments, and some cities have launched patriotic competitions of mutual challenge. Workers in various cities and farmers in the suburbs are at the forefront of the movement. The payment figure of workers in Nanjing has reached 65% of the total pledged amount; farmers in the suburbs have overfulfilled the plan for the "Nanjing Farmer" fighter plane. Industrialists and businessmen in various cities have also been actively competing in the movement. Industries such as fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, mines, barber shops, and bathhouses in Dalian have all completed about 90% of the entire plan ahead of schedule.
