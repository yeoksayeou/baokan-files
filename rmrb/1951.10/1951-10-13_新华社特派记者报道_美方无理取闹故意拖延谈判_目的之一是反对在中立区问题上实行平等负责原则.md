Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Reports from Kaesong:

    The U.S. Side Obstructs Negotiations with Unreasonable Demands. One of the Aims is to Oppose the Principle of Equal Responsibility in the Neutral Zone Issue.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th] Our special correspondent reports: Over the past two days, the liaison officers' meetings held at Panmunjom have reached a general agreement on the basic conditions for the resumption of meetings by both delegations, such as the specific location of the meeting venue, the specific measures for joint protection of the meeting area by both sides, the equipment and layout of the meeting venue, and all necessary temporary arrangements for the resumption of meetings by both delegations. Consequently, our liaison officer specifically suggested at the afternoon meeting on the 11th that both delegations resume meetings at 1:00 PM on the 12th. Originally, as long as the other side had the sincerity to resume negotiations, the armistice negotiations could be resumed immediately. However, because the other side still insisted on discussing other issues that should be discussed at the delegation meetings and unreasonably rejected our specific suggestions regarding the date and time for the resumption of meetings by both delegations, the armistice negotiations, which have been suspended for 51 days, still cannot be quickly resumed. This fact once again undeniably proves that the U.S. side continues to play the conspiracy of delaying and obstructing negotiations.
    The people of the world all know that the Korean armistice negotiation meeting held in Kaesong was forced to stop due to the murderous bombing and strafing by United Nations forces aircraft on the evening of August 22, targeting the residences of our delegation within the conference site area. After this, the United Nations forces side successively created a series of provocative incidents of ground attacks and aerial reconnaissance, patrols, bombing, and strafing, causing the meeting to be suspended for 27 days. After the other side acknowledged the strafing incident on September 10 and expressed its responsibility for abiding by the neutralization agreement, Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai immediately suggested that both delegations resume negotiations immediately. However, the other side created extraneous issues, insisting on changing the meeting venue as an unreasonable condition for resumption, which again prevented the rapid resumption of armistice negotiations. On the 7th of this month, in order to make another effort for peace and to test whether the U.S. side still had the sincerity to negotiate, Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai suggested expanding the scope of the neutral zone in the meeting area, moving the meeting venue to Panmunjom, and having both sides responsible for protecting this meeting venue. Subsequently, they suggested that liaison officers from both sides meet at Panmunjom on the 10th to discuss the resumption of meetings by both delegations. Over the past two days, the liaison officers' meeting has generally reached an agreement on the specific arrangements for the resumption of meetings. Thus, Ridgway should agree to our specific suggestions for resumption and quickly resume the meetings. However, why doesn't Ridgway immediately agree to the resumption? Apart from attempting to continue delaying and obstructing the resumption of armistice negotiations in order to achieve his ulterior motives, there can be no other explanation.
    People here believe that one of the purposes of Ridgway's continued delay and obstruction of the resumption of negotiations is to oppose the principle of equal responsibility on the neutral zone issue. On October 7, Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai stated in their reply to Ridgway that in order to prevent the recurrence of incidents that violate the neutralization agreement of the meeting area, and especially to make both sides responsible for the neutralization agreement, no longer allowing it to be used only to restrain our side as in the past, while the U.S. side can arbitrarily destroy and deny it under the pretext of not being responsible for the area, it was suggested that the neutral zone of the meeting area be expanded into an oblong area including both Kaesong and Munsan. Ridgway, in his reply on October 8, deliberately violated this principle of equal responsibility, even attempting to overturn the original agreement on the neutralization of Kaesong, and only proposed that "stipulating that Kaesong, Munsan, and the highways from Kaesong and Munsan to Panmunjom are not subject to attack is sufficient." Even so, Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai stated in their reply on October 9 that in order to resume negotiations immediately, they suggested that the issue of expanding the neutral zone be resolved at the meetings of both delegations. This once again demonstrated our side's sincere efforts for peace. However, the U.S. side deliberately created difficulties and made unreasonable demands, insisting on discussing this issue at the liaison officers' meeting. Apart from further exposing the U.S. side's arrogance and unreasonableness in deliberately delaying negotiations, what more appropriate answer can be found? However, the people of the world have seen very clearly that the Korean-Chinese side has made repeated efforts for peace. Now, people cannot help but ask Ridgway: How long do you intend to delay the negotiations by deliberately delaying them? What are your intentions in repeatedly obstructing the resumption of negotiations?

    新华社特派记者报道
    美方无理取闹故意拖延谈判
    目的之一是反对在中立区问题上实行平等负责原则
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者报道：在板门店举行的双方联络官会议，两天来已就双方代表团复会的基本条件，如会场具体地点、会场区双方共同负责护卫的具体办法、会场的设备与布置以及双方代表团复会时的所有必要的临时安排，大致取得了一致的意见。我方联络官遂于十一日下午的会议上，具体建议双方代表团在十二日下午一时复会。本来，只要对方抱有恢复谈判的诚意，停战谈判便能立即恢复。但是，由于对方在会上仍坚持要讨论其他应该放在代表团会议上讨论的问题，并无理地拒绝了我方关于双方代表团复会日期和时间的具体建议，使停顿已达五十一日之久的停战谈判，仍不能迅速获得恢复。这一事实，又一次无可置辩地证明了美方继续在玩弄拖延和阻挠谈判的阴谋。
    全世界的人民都知道：在开城举行的朝鲜停战谈判会议，是由于八月二十二日晚联合国军飞机以会址区内我方代表团住所为目标，施行谋杀性的轰炸、扫射而被迫停开的。在此以后，联合国军方面又接连制造了一连串地面袭击和空中侦察、巡逻、轰炸、扫射的挑衅事件，使会议停开了二十七天。在对方承认了九月十日的扫射事件并对遵守中立化协议表示负责态度之后，金日成、彭德怀两将军便立即建议双方代表团立即恢复谈判；但是，对方却节外生枝，坚持更换会议地址作为复会条件的无理要求，这又使停战谈判不能迅速恢复。本月七日，金日成、彭德怀两将军为了再作一次和平的努力，并为考验美方是否尚有和谈诚意，建议将会议地区中立区的范围扩大，将会场地址移至板门店，由双方负责保护这一会场地址；其后，并建议双方联络官于十日在板门店会晤，协商双方代表团的复会事宜。两天以来，联络官会议已就复会事宜的具体的安排大致取得了一致意见。这样，李奇微就应当同意我方复会的具体建议，迅速复会。但是，李奇微为什么又不立即同意复会呢？这除了企图继续拖延和阻挠恢复停战谈判，以达到他的不可告人的目的以外，是不可能有任何别的解释的。
    此间人士认为：李奇微继续拖延和阻挠谈判恢复的目的之一，是为了反对在中立区问题上实行平等负责的原则。十月七日，金日成、彭德怀两将军在致李奇微的复信中曾提出：为了使违反会场地区中立化协议的事件不再重犯，尤其是要使双方对中立化协议负责，再不容许像过去那样只用来约束我方而美方可以藉口对该地区没有责任而肆意破坏和抵赖；因此，建议将会议地区的中立范围扩大成为将开城、汶山都包括在内的一个长形地区。李奇微在十月八日的复信中居心违反这个平等负责的原则，甚至企图推翻原来关于开城中立化的协议，而只是提出：“规定开城、汶山及由开城和汶山通往板门店的公路不受攻击，就已够了。”虽然是这样，金日成、彭德怀两将军在十月九日的复信中仍表示：为了立即恢复谈判，建议将中立区的扩大问题留到双方代表团的会议上去解决。这又一次表示了我方对和平的真诚努力。但美方却故意刁难、无理取闹，坚持要将此项问题放在联络官会议上讨论，这除了更加暴露美方的蛮横无理故意拖延谈判之外，还能找到什么更恰当的答案呢？然而，全世界人民已经看得很清楚，朝中方面已为和平作了一次又一次的努力。现在人们不能不向李奇微发问：你们故意拖延谈判，究竟打算拖到什么时候为止呢？你们一再地阻挠谈判的恢复，究竟居心何在呢？
