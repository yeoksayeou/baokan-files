Our Understanding of "Classroom Discussion"
Liu Jingyu Peng Ming

Editor's Note: "Classroom Discussion" is the Soviet "Seminar." In the past, due to the lack of a suitable translation, the original transliteration was generally used. In order to promote this learning method and make the translation of "Seminar" reflect its characteristics, after discussion at the Renmin University of China, it was deemed appropriate to change it to "Classroom Discussion."

The so-called "Classroom Discussion" is neither a lecture in the classroom nor a group discussion as used in the past, but a discussion of the course content conducted in the classroom under the direct leadership of the teacher in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner. This article introduces the experience gained by Renmin University of China in using "Classroom Discussion" and is available for reference by educators in various regions.

I. The Tasks and Importance of "Classroom Discussion"

Renmin University of China has absorbed advanced Soviet experience in all aspects of teaching, and "Classroom Discussion" is one of the important experiences.

"Classroom Discussion," originally СеминаР, was previously translated according to transliteration as "Seminar." Recently, in order to better suit its actual content and make it easier for people to understand, Renmin University of China has changed it to "Classroom Discussion" after careful discussion. Classroom Discussion is a teaching method that involves planned, focused, and step-by-step discussion and research on course content under the direct leadership of the teacher. This method is mainly applied to theoretical courses. Experience over the past year has proven that it is a successful method for conducting systematic and formal learning of scientific theories. However, "Classroom Discussion" is not an independent teaching method; it is only a link in the entire teaching process, that is, it is conducted after a unit is completed in the large lecture. Its purpose is to implement the content of the large lecture, and through "Classroom Discussion," students can digest and consolidate what was taught in the large lecture. Some students reacted: "Not having 'Classroom Discussion' is almost the same as not attending the large lecture." This means that in the large lecture, students listen and take notes, but they cannot think deeply. If "Classroom Discussion" is not conducted, the notes are discarded and quickly forgotten. With "Classroom Discussion," students are urged to read reference books, review the large lecture, use their own brains, write outlines in their own words, and conduct defenses and discussions in the classroom, and finally listen to the teacher's summary. After such a process, the understanding of the problem is much deeper.

Experience has shown that if students do well in each unit's "Classroom Discussion," their academic performance will be excellent, and when preparing for exams at the end of the semester, the phenomenon of "digging a well when thirsty" and "burning the midnight oil" will be eliminated. This method of consolidating teaching results should be one of the important markers distinguishing it from the old universities.

In addition to deepening students' understanding of the large lecture and consolidating teaching results, the tasks of "Classroom Discussion" also include cultivating students' habit of independent research in their major, cultivating students' ability to systematically analyze and explain problems, and checking teachers' teaching effectiveness and students' academic performance.

II. Basic Methods for Conducting "Classroom Discussion"

Based on the tasks of "Classroom Discussion," it can be known that it is not a separate set of activities apart from the large lecture, nor is it a simple repetition of the large lecture. We have taken detours on this point. Initially, some teachers understood "Classroom Discussion" as a kind of auxiliary class, so they found a lot of materials to supplement it. Although this approach can be welcomed by some students, it violates the purpose of "Classroom Discussion" and is equivalent to teaching a new course. Some teachers simply repeated the large lecture, lecturing once in the large class and then again in the small class. Students said, "What's the point of this?" Obviously, this approach also fails to achieve the purpose of "Classroom Discussion."

Therefore, "Classroom Discussion" must master the following basic methods:

First, combine question and answer with explanation, with question and answer as the main focus. Question and answer means the teacher asks and the student answers. Explanation means the teacher makes a summary speech.

The questions should not be too broad or too narrow. If they are too broad, it is not easy to go into depth and detail, and it is easy to form a monopoly of speeches by individuals; if they are too narrow, the questions are fragmented, and it is impossible to make a systematic explanation, losing the integrity of the problem and failing to achieve the purpose of "Classroom Discussion." This question and answer method was criticized in the Soviet Union a long time ago. (See A. Shadlina's writing: "The Seminar is the Basic Form of Classroom Learning in Political Schools" in "Learning Series" Volume 1) Generally speaking, for classes with a higher level, the questions can be asked more broadly; for classes with a lower level, the questions can be asked more narrowly.

Second, combine assigned speeches with free speeches. Assigned speeches are a good way to urge students to study seriously and for teachers to comprehensively understand students' learning situation. Because everyone has the possibility of being assigned to speak, it prompts everyone to prepare a speech outline seriously. In order to avoid the tendency of students only looking at their own outlines and simply answering questions regardless of other people's speeches, the teacher must also assign students to criticize each other. In addition to assigned speeches, free speeches must be combined, especially when unfolding debates on issues. The teacher should carefully analyze different opinions, clearly raise questions, guide in-depth discussions, and unfold debates. Experience has proven that the time when questions unfold debates is also the most active and mentally concentrated time in the classroom. Through debates, the teacher more truthfully examines the breadth and depth of each speaker's understanding of the issue.

The teacher should evaluate the students' speeches and record them as "pass" or "fail" in the grade book as the students' usual grades.

Furthermore, the teacher's summary should be clear, concise, profound, and closely integrated with the students' speeches. After the students speak, the teacher makes a summary speech. This summary is basically based on the answers prepared in advance. The summary speech strives to be clear, concise, and profound, without rambling on and on and not being able to explain the central meaning for a long time, but it cannot be too simple. The teacher should record the main points of the students' speeches at any time and organize them into their own summary speech, affirming the correct speeches and appropriately criticizing the wrong or vague viewpoints. Only a summary that is closely combined with the students' speeches can clarify all wrong viewpoints and improve students' understanding; otherwise, it will inevitably form a simple and rigid implementation of the answer and a repetition of the lecture content.

Generally speaking, in classes with a higher level, the summary strives to be simple and clear; in classes with a lower level, it can explain more.

The teacher's summary does not have to wait until all the questions have been discussed before being done. It should be given in a timely manner after each topic is finished, depending on the nature of the question, so that the impression is deep.

III. Full Preparation by Teachers and Students is Key to Doing a Good Job in "Classroom Discussion"

Before the large lecture or at the end of the large lecture, the lecturer should formulate the topics for "Classroom Discussion." There should not be too many topics or too few. If there are too many, it is not easy to go into depth; if there are too few, it cannot take care of the entire course content. Generally, three or four questions are appropriate for every two hours. In short, it should be determined according to the weight of the content and the length of time. After the topics are formulated, they should be announced, and teachers and students should prepare separately.

For the teacher's preparation, the most important thing is to hold a "Classroom Discussion" preparation meeting. This meeting is conducted under the leadership of the lecturer. The answers to the "Classroom Discussion" are formulated by the lecturer or by the teacher designated by the lecturer. At the meeting, the content of the answers or outlines must first be briefly reported, and then discussed. The preparation meeting must discuss the purpose to be achieved by this "Classroom Discussion," whether the viewpoints of the answers are correct, and whether the selection of materials is appropriate, so that each teacher is very clear in their thinking. In addition, the difficult questions of the students and the questions that the teachers have not yet solved should also be selectively discussed, and finally the lecturer should make a conclusion.

This kind of preparation meeting is an important method to guarantee the scientificity and unity of the course content. After the preparation meeting, the teacher who is doing the "Classroom Discussion" should prepare further: for the content of the answer, they should read the necessary reference materials and conduct in-depth research; for the steps and methods of asking questions, they should also make careful consideration.

For the students' preparation, they must review the lecture notes, read the minimum amount of reference books specified, and finally write a speech outline.

Writing a speech outline is extremely important. This is an important method to guarantee the consolidation of teaching results and cultivate independent research in the major, and it is also the basis for easily concentrating opinions when speaking. Initially, some students did not make outlines, and when answering questions, they were verbose and unsystematic, or they read directly from the book. They did not understand it at all, and others found it dry and tasteless. This naturally affects the effect of "Classroom Discussion."

How to write a speech outline is a very important question. We require that it be spoken in one's own words (that is, something that has been digested through one's own stomach). Some students feel that they do not know how to do it well, which requires the teacher to give specific help to some students so that they can master how to review and how to write an outline. We started to pay attention to this issue this year, but we don't have any experience yet.

In short, full preparation by both teachers and students is the key to doing a good job in "Classroom Discussion." Experience has proven that wherever this is done, there is vitality and achievement in the classroom. Conversely, there is no vitality, or very little achievement.

IV. "Classroom Discussion" Implements the Spirit of the Teaching Responsibility System

"Classroom Discussion" implements the spirit of the teaching responsibility system, that is, the teacher should guarantee that all students in the class learn well. Therefore, the teacher must also gradually understand the level of each student so as to appropriately grasp it in the classroom and provide specific help. In the Soviet Union, there is a full-time "Classroom Discussion" teacher for every class of 20 to 25 students, so it is easier to provide specific help to students. Today we do not have such conditions because the class size is large (there are 50 students), there are few teachers, and one teacher is responsible for several classes. Therefore, this year we can only do random checks of outlines and notes. In the future, when conditions permit, we should achieve the full teacher responsibility system.

The above is our understanding of "Classroom Discussion." Experience has proven that it is a systematic and formal method for learning scientific theories. Some comrades said: "'Classroom Discussion' saves time and solves problems." This method should be promoted in a planned and step-by-step manner. At the same time, we should create different new methods according to different conditions to make its content richer, more scientific, and more suitable for our actual requirements.

    我们对“课堂讨论”的认识
    刘经宇  彭明
    编者按：“课堂讨论”即苏联的“习明纳尔”，过去因找不到恰当的翻译名词，一般仍按原字译音通用。为了推广此种学习方法，使“习明纳尔”的译名能表现它的特点，经中国人民大学讨论，认为以改称“课堂讨论”为宜。
    所谓“课堂讨论”，既不是课堂中的讲课，也不是过去学习中所沿用的小组讨论会，而是在教员直接领导下有计划、有重点、有步骤地在课堂上进行的关于课程内容的讨论。这里发表的这篇文章，介绍了中国人民大学运用“课堂讨论”所获得的经验，可供各地教育工作者参考。一、“课堂讨论”的任务及其
    重要性
    中国人民大学在教学工作上吸收了苏联各方面的先进经验，“课堂讨论”是其中重要经验之一。
    “课堂讨论”，原文为СеминаР，过去按照音译，称为“习明纳尔”，最近为求更加适合于它的实际内容，并使人们容易明了起见，中国人民大学经慎重讨论后，一律改称“课堂讨论”。课堂讨论，是在教员直接领导下有计划、有重点、有步骤地进行关于课程内容的讨论与研究的一种教学方法。这种方法主要应用于理论课程方面。一年来的经验证明，它是进行有系统地正规地学习科学理论的一种成功的方法。但“课堂讨论”不是一种独立的教学方法，它只是全部教学过程中的一个环节，即：它是在大课讲完一个单元之后进行的。它的目的是贯彻大课内容，通过“课堂讨论”使同学把大课上所讲的加以消化而巩固下来。有的同学反应：“没有‘课堂讨论’几乎等于没上大课”。意思是说，在大课上一面听讲，一面笔记，不能深入思考。如不进行“课堂讨论”，笔记一抛，很快就忘了。有了“课堂讨论”，就推动着同学们必须阅读参考书，把大课加以复习，通过自己的脑子，用自己的话写成提纲，在课堂上进行答辩、讨论，最后听取教员的总结。有了这样一个过程，对问题的理解就深刻得多了。
    经验证明，同学们如果每一单元的“课堂讨论”做得好，学习成绩一定优良，学习终了准备考试时，便会消除了那种“临渴掘井”“开夜车”的现象。这样一种巩固教学成果的方法，该是与旧大学区别的重要标志之一。
    “课堂讨论”的任务，除了加深同学对大课的理解、巩固教学成果外，还有着养成同学独立钻研专业的习惯、培养同学系统地分析问题与说明问题的能力与检查教员教学效果与同学学习成绩等好处。二、进行“课堂讨论”的基本
    方法
    根据“课堂讨论”的任务，可以知道，它不是抛开大课另搞一套，也不是简单的重复大课。在这一点上我们是曾经走过弯路的。最初有的教员了解“课堂讨论”为一种辅助课，因此找了很多材料加以补充，这样做法虽也能受到某些同学的欢迎，但它却违反了“课堂讨论”的目的，等于上了一次新课；有的教员则简单重复大课，大课讲一遍，小课再讲一遍，同学们说：“这有什么意思呢？”显然的，这种做法，也达不到“课堂讨论”的目的。
    因此，“课堂讨论”必须掌握下面一些基本的方法：
    首先，问答与讲解相结合，以问答为主。问答，即教员问学生答。讲解，即教员做总结发言。
    问答的题目不宜过大，也不宜过小。过大则不易深入具体，并且容易形成个别人的垄断发言；过小则使问题支离破碎，不能作有系统的说明，失去问题的完整性也达不到“课堂讨论”的目的，在苏联这种问答法也是早被批判了的。（见A·夏德林娜写：“座谈会是政治学校中课堂学习底基本形式”载“学习丛刊”第一辑）一般的讲，程度较高的班次，问题可发问的较大些；较低的班次，则可较小些。
    其次，指定发言与自由发言相结合，指定发言是督促同学认真学习与教员全面了解同学学习情况的好方法。因为每人都有被指定发言的可能，就促使着每个人都须认真地准备发言提纲。为了避免同学不管别人发言，只看自己提纲这种单纯回答问题的偏向，教员又须指定同学相互批判，除指定发言以外，必须结合自由发言，尤其是在展开对问题论辩的时候。教员应仔细地分析不同意见，明确提出问题，引导深入，展开辩论。经验证明：问题展开论辩的时候也是课堂最活跃与人们精神最集中的时候。通过论辩，教员也就更真实地考察了每一发言人对问题理解的广度和深度。
    对同学的发言，教员要加以评判，以“及格”、“不及格”记录在记分册上，作为同学们的平时成绩。
    再者，教员的总结要明确、扼要、深刻，并与同学发言密切结合。同学们发言之后，教员做总结发言。这个总结，基本上是根据事先拟好的答案而作的。总结发言力求明确、扼要、深刻，不要废话连篇，半天还说不清中心意思，但也不能过于简单。教员应随时记录同学发言的要点，组织到自己的总结发言中去，对正确的发言予以肯定；对错误的或模糊的观点，则应予以恰如其分的批判。只有密切结合同学发言的总结，才能澄清一切错误观点，把同学的认识提高一步；否则势必形成简单地硬性地执行答案，重复讲授内容。
    一般地讲，在程度较高的班，总结力求简单明确；在程度较低的班，则可多解释一些。
    教员总结，不必等全部问题都讨论完了后再做，应视问题性质，于每一题目终了后，及时地予以总结，这样印象深刻。三、教员与学生的充分准备是
    做好“课堂讨论”的关键
    上大课以前或在大课将结束时，要由主讲教员拟定“课堂讨论”的题目。题目不宜过多，也不宜过少。过多则不易深入，过少则不能照顾全部课程内容。一般每二小时，以出三四题为宜。总之，要根据内容的分量及时间长短来决定。题目拟定后，即予公布，教员与学生分头准备。
    属于教员的准备，最重要者即要开好“课堂讨论”准备会，这个会是在主讲教员主持下进行的。“课堂讨论”答案由主讲教员拟定或由其指定之教员拟定。会议上，首先须简要地报告答案或提纲的内容，然后进行讨论。准备会必须对本次“课堂讨论”要达到的目的、答案论点是否正确、选材是否恰当进行讨论，使每个教员在思想上十分明确。另外，同学中的疑难问题以及教员尚未解决的问题也择要加以讨论，最后由主讲教员做出结论。
    这种准备会是保证课程内容的科学性与统一性的重要方法。准备会开过之后，做“课堂讨论”的教员仍要再加以准备：对答案内容，要阅读必要参考材料，作深入的研究；对发问的步骤与方法，也要加以缜密的考虑。
    属于同学的准备，即必须复习讲义、笔记，阅读所指定的最低限度的参考书，最后写出发言提纲。
    写发言提纲，极为重要，这是保证巩固教学效果、培养独立钻研专业的重要方法，也是发言时易于集中意见的基础。最初有的同学不作提纲，回答问题时即啰啰嗦嗦漫无系统，或者是照本宣读。自己根本没弄懂，别人听着也干燥无味。这样自然影响“课堂讨论”的效果。
    如何写发言提纲，是个很重要的问题。我们要求用自己的话讲出来（即经过自己的肠胃消化过了的东西）。有的同学感到不知如何作才好，这就要求教员对一部分同学作具体的帮助，使其掌握如何复习，如何写提纲的方法。我们今年开始注意到这一问题，但还没有什么经验。
    总之，教员与学生双方的充分准备是作好“课堂讨论”的关键。经验证明，凡是这样作了的，课堂上就有生气，有成绩。反之，就无生气，或成绩很少。四、“课堂讨论”贯彻着教学
    负责制的精神
    “课堂讨论”贯彻着教学负责制的精神，即教员应当保证本班所有同学都学得好。因此教员也须逐步了解每个同学的程度，以便在课堂上适当掌握，并进行具体帮助。在苏联每个班二十人到二十五人有一专任的“课堂讨论”教员，这样就比较容易对同学进行具体帮助。今天我们还不具备这样的条件，因为班次大（有五十人者），教员少，一个教员又负责几个班。因此今年我们还只能做到抽查提纲、笔记等工作。以后条件具备时，应该做到全部的教员负责制。
    以上是我们对“课堂讨论”的认识。经验证明，它是一种有系统地正规地学习科学理论的方法。有的同志说：“‘课堂讨论’又节省时间又解决问题”。这种方法应该有计划有步骤地推行起来。同时，应该根据不同条件，创造不同的新方法，使其内容更丰富、更科学、更适合于我们的实际要求。
