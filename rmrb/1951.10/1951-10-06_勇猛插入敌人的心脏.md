    Bravely Inserting into the Enemy's Heart
    People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Cui Jianguo
    On the Korean battlefield, during the second counterattack of the Fifth Campaign, our unit participated in the battle to eliminate the 38th Regiment of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division. At that time, I was the platoon leader of the Second Platoon of the Ninth Company.
    On May 17th, the campaign began. Our battalion was the "dagger battalion" tasked with cutting off the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division's 38th Regiment. My comrades and I in the entire platoon requested multiple times overnight and were honored to be assigned the assault mission – to seize the 752 Height of Gari Mountain in Hongcheon. All the comrades in the platoon were extremely happy.
    After a long night march, we penetrated the heavy blockades of the U.S. 37th and 36th Regiments and directly reached the forward positions of the U.S. 38th Regiment. After scouting the terrain, I discovered four bunkers halfway up the mountain, which had to be taken down before we could attack the summit. The enemy had a commanding view and strong defenses, so it would be difficult for us to attack from the front. After considering this, I divided our entire platoon into four assault teams, including myself, with each team responsible for taking down a designated bunker. We quickly迂回flanked the enemy's rear to attack. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy crawled out of the bunkers and tried to escape, but under our fierce fire, all eighteen enemies were annihilated. In just five minutes, we captured these four bunkers in the enemy's forward positions.
    Immediately afterwards, I divided the troops into two groups to attack the second and third hilltops. The defending enemy on the second hilltop were either annihilated or captured; the defending enemy on the third hilltop fled in panic upon hearing the gunfire. In just ten minutes, we occupied three hilltops, seized the 752 Height, opened the path for the assault, and ensured the smooth advance of the penetrating forces. We completed both the assault and the stronghold attack missions.
    Our troops continued to advance, thrusting towards the headquarters of the U.S. 38th Regiment stationed at Dashuidong. I led the entire platoon to quickly insert ourselves onto the highway leading to Hongcheon, cutting off the enemy's motorcade, blocking the enemy and preventing them from escaping, and capturing a large number of vehicles.
    Our mission at this time was to disrupt the enemy's formation and penetrate the enemy's heart. The enemy was surrounded by our troops on all sides, and with our dagger inserted within, they were in complete disarray, clamoring and rushing around aimlessly. The enemy attempted to open a path to break through, launching a collective charge. In an emergency situation where the enemy and our forces were numerically disproportionate, and the follow-up troops had not yet arrived, Company Commander Tao Songshan gloriously sacrificed himself, and I became the acting company commander. I concentrated and organized our firepower to shoot at the enemy. In close combat, we fully utilized the power of light firearms, and enemies fell in droves. I encouraged the comrades, saying, "Comrades! Strike hard! What excellent targets! One bullet can take down two or three." I held a revolving gun and fired for more than ten minutes. When the bullets ran out, I picked up the two automatic rifles we had just captured and fired them simultaneously. After the bullets were depleted, I switched to a heavy machine gun. In this way, my comrades and I repelled two collective counterattacks by the enemy.
    To escape the fate of being completely annihilated, the enemy, regardless of their heavy casualties, continued to counterattack desperately. At this time, we had used up all our bullets, so I ordered the comrades, "Comrades! Fix bayonets! The time has come to serve our country!" I was the first to jump out of the fortifications with my bayonet fixed. Instantly, battle cries erupted. The comrades jumped out of the fortifications one after another. In the pitch-black night, on the enemy's position, a brave and fierce bayonet melee unfolded.
    I aimed my bayonet at the chest of the enemy in front of me and thrust it in, knocking down six enemies in a row. The bayonet was bent, and I was splattered with blood! I was wounded on my legs. The comrades all demonstrated the heroic spirit of the Chinese people. Ammunition handler Wu Yincheng was pinned to the ground by an enemy. He bit off the enemy's ear, and the enemy fled holding his bloody head; machine gunner Wei Ming smashed the heads of two enemies with a round shovel; squad leader Shen Xueli, though wounded, still fought bravely with the enemy. This earth-shattering melee only terrified the enemy, who fled in a panic. Six American soldiers were so frightened that they knelt before me and surrendered.
    On the night of the 18th, we received the task of capturing the mountain to the left of Dashuidong. The heroes, who had endured a fierce melee the night before, were inspired by their ambition to annihilate the enemy and forgot their fatigue. They quickly and decisively inserted themselves into the enemy's position. After a barrage of grenades, the enemies were frightened and ran away. Only one enemy was covering the retreat of the others with a heavy machine gun. I circled behind him, grabbed his long hair, and captured both him and the gun.
    During the search, I killed another six enemies and captured five alive. While defending our position after the search, although enemy planes constantly bombed the position, we held firm for three days and three nights until the end of the battle.
    In this battle, our entire company captured one 82mm gun, one chemical mortar, three rocket launchers, four heavy machine guns, thirty-eight automatic rifles, nine carbines, two portable transceivers, and four telephones. We killed or wounded over 120 enemies and captured 42 enemies. In this battle, I killed over twenty enemies, stabbed six to death with a bayonet, captured eight alive, and captured two carbines, five automatic rifles, one chemical mortar, and one heavy machine gun. After the campaign, I was awarded the title of Special Class Meritorious Hero. (Attached picture)

    勇猛插入敌人的心脏
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  崔建国
    在朝鲜战场上，在第五次战役第二次反击的时候，我们的部队参加了消灭美军第二师第三十八团的那一仗。那时候，我在九连二排当排长。
    五月十七日，战役开始了。我们营是插断美军第二师第三十八团的尖刀营。我和全排同志一夜曾提出数次请求，才光荣地担任了突击任务——夺取洪川的加里山的七五二高地。全排同志高兴极了。
    经过长时间的夜行军，通过了美军第三十七团、三十六团的重重封锁，直插到美军三十八团的阵地前沿。我侦察了地形后，发觉半山腰有四个地堡，必须先夺下地堡才能攻上山头。敌人居高临下，防御很严，我们如果从正面攻击是很困难的。我考虑了一下，就把我们全排分成四个突击小组，我也在内，每个小组负责攻下指定的一个地堡。我们迅速地迂回到敌人后面进行攻击，敌人见势不好，爬出地堡就想逃跑，但是在我们猛烈的射击下，十八个敌人全部被歼了。只五分钟我们就夺下了这四个敌人前沿阵地的地堡。
    紧接着我又把部队分成两路，攻击第二个和第三个山头。第二个山头的守敌有的被歼，有的被俘；第三个山头的守敌，听见枪声就闻风而逃。只十分钟我们就占领了三个山头，夺下了七五二高地，打开了突击的道路，保证了穿插部队的顺利前进。我们完成了突击任务和攻坚任务。
    我们的部队继续前进，插向美军三十八团团部驻地大水洞。我率领着全排同志迅速地插到通往洪川的公路上，把敌人的汽车队拦腰打断，卡住了敌人，使他们无法逃跑，并缴获了大量汽车。
    我们此时接受的任务是打乱敌阵，插入敌人的心脏。敌人被四周的我军团团围住，里面又有我们这一把尖刀在穿插，已毫无秩序，乱吵乱嚷，四处乱窜。敌人企图打开一条路突围，就发动了集体的冲锋，在敌我兵力悬殊的紧急情况下，后续部队尚未赶到，连长陶松山同志又光荣牺牲了，我就代理连长。我集中组织了火力向敌人射击，短兵相接，充分地发挥了轻火器的威力，敌人一片一片地倒下去了。我鼓励同志们说：“同志们！猛打呀！这是多么好的目标啊！一颗子弹能穿倒两三个。”我端着转盘枪，打了十多分钟，子弹打光了，就端起刚缴获的两支自动枪同时射击，打完了子弹，又换上重机关枪打。就这样，我和全体同志打退了敌人的两次集体反扑。
    敌人为了想逃脱全部被歼的命运，就不顾惨重的伤亡，依旧拚命地反扑。这时，我们全部子弹已经打完，我就向同志们下命令：“同志们！拚刺刀呀！为祖国立功的时候到了！”我首先端着上好了刺刀的枪跳出了工事。一时杀声四起，同志们相继跳出工事，在漆黑的夜里，在敌人的阵地上，展开了英勇而激烈的白刃肉搏战。
    我端着刺刀对准我面前的敌人的胸膛刺进去，一连拚倒了六个敌人，把刺刀都使弯了，溅了我满身的污血！我身上腿上也负了伤。同志们都表现了中国人民的英雄气概。弹药手吴银成同志被一个敌人压在地下，他咬掉了敌人的耳朵，敌人抱着血淋淋的脑袋逃跑了；机枪射手魏明同志用圆铁锹劈碎了两个敌人的头；班长申学礼同志虽然负伤四处还和敌人勇猛地拚杀。这一场惊天动地的肉搏战，只杀得敌人胆战心惊，狼狈溃逃。有六个美国兵吓软了，跪在我面前当了俘虏。
    十八日夜，我们又接受了攻取大水洞左侧山头的任务，经过一夜激烈肉搏的英雄们，被歼敌的雄心所鼓舞着，都忘掉了疲劳，迅速而果敢地插到敌人阵地，一阵手榴弹轰炸后，敌人都吓跑了，只有一个敌人用一挺重机枪掩护着其他的敌人溃退，我就绕到他背后，一把抓住他的长头发，人枪俱获。
    在搜索工作中，我又打死了六个敌人，活捉了五个。搜索后在防守阵地的时候，虽然敌人的飞机不断地来轰炸阵地，但我们一直坚守了三天三夜，直到战斗结束。
    在这次战斗中，我们全连缴获了八二炮一门，化学炮一门，火箭筒三个，重机枪四挺，自动步枪三十八枝，卡宾枪九枝，步行收发机两部，电话机四部。打死打伤敌人一百二十余人，俘虏敌人四十二人。我在这次战斗中，打死了敌人二十几个，用刺刀刺死六个，活捉了八个，缴获卡宾枪两枝，自动步枪五枝，化学炮一门，重机枪一挺。战役结束后，被评为特等功臣。（附图片）
