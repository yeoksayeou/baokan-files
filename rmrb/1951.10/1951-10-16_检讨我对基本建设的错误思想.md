    Self-Criticism of My Erroneous Thinking on Basic Construction
    Xie Zizhen, Chief Engineer of the Fuel Industry Bureau of the Central South Industrial Department
    I originally studied metallurgy, but I switched to coal mining because there was no future before Liberation. I have been working in the coal industry since 1939 when I started learning about coal mining. Initially, I followed the instructions of my "superiors" every day, doing whatever I was told, and I never had the opportunity to participate in planning and design. At that time, I thought planning and design were mysterious. Later, when I became an engineer, although I sometimes did planning or design, those plans and designs were all done sitting in a room, spouting nonsense based on the intentions of my "superiors," with the aim of swindling money. The goal was to get the "government" to spend money. What actually happened was another matter, and even the plans were completely changed. As long as I could justify it and come up with a bunch of difficulties, I could get away with it. As for the design, I would only draw two fragmented drawings and hang them on the wall as a facade. In fact, everything was done for show. I thought that reworking and changing plans were a matter of adapting to circumstances, and I never considered them serious mistakes. It was this kind of thinking that caused a series of errors after Liberation.
    When Hunan was liberated, I was the Engineering Associate at the Xiangjiang Mining Company. The company had two coalfields, one Jurassic that was being mined and was about to be exhausted, and one Permian that was being explored, with three boreholes encountering coal seams but not yet developed. After Liberation, some comrades in the mine suggested to the responsible comrades who took over: the Jurassic coalfield is almost finished, so we must quickly develop the Xiejiatang Permian coalfield to maintain production. The comrades who took over discussed it with me. I was afraid that Xiangjiang would close down and I would lose my job, so I agreed. In fact, I had worked at the Zhongxiang Coal Mine for about a year during the War of Resistance Against Japan, sinking four pairs of shafts, none of which could be maintained. The pressure was the greatest I had ever seen in my coal mining career, and the water was also quite abundant. The situation at Xiejiatang had been explored by drilling, and the pressure was the same as at Zhongxiang. At that time, I knew in my heart that I could not overcome this difficulty with the current technical level, but in order to keep my job, I asked the mine to make a plan without any guarantee, with the idea of getting the money first. After the Central Financial and Economic Commission approved it, the Xiejiatang mine started blindly. At the end of March 1950, I was transferred to work in the Industry and Mining Department of the Central South Industrial Department. Later, the Industry and Mining Department of the Central South Industrial Department was reorganized into the Fuel Industry Bureau. After working in the bureau for two months, I slowly realized that I would not lose my job. Then I suggested to the leading comrades to stop the Xiejiatang mine to avoid continuing to waste state funds. But more than 330 million yuan had already been wasted. This waste was entirely due to my selfishness and lack of understanding of the new society. I personally bear the main responsibility and am willing to accept any punishment from the government.
    I directly took on the coal industry planning work in the bureau, but every time I saw the Central Financial and Economic Commission's planning table, I had a headache. I always thought it was so troublesome and would waste a lot of manpower, materials, and time. This April, I saw the interim regulations on the basic construction work procedures promulgated by the Central Financial and Economic Commission, and I thought the conditions were too high and too harsh. If they were implemented like that, planning and design would require a large number of technical personnel and a lot of time, and it would waste even more manpower, materials, and time! I thought it was better to rely on experience and adapt to circumstances. This way, we could start early and finish quickly, saving both manpower and time, and we could also increase production ahead of schedule. After studying the editorials and articles about basic construction published in the People's Daily since June 16, I realized that the waste caused by the lack of engineering design far exceeded what I thought was wasted. After reading the inspection reports on the basic construction of the Pingxiang and Yiluo coal mines, it became even more clear that the waste phenomenon was caused by the lack of careful planning and detailed technical design. What I thought was a waste before was precisely the way to ensure the elimination of waste; what I thought could save the country was precisely the root cause of waste.
    I realized the importance of a highly responsible technical personnel and the danger of an irresponsible technical personnel in basic construction work. Especially senior technical personnel, if they are sloppy, they will destroy the entire project and affect the country's economic construction. Technical personnel should pay high attention to this important task.

    检讨我对基本建设的错误思想
    中南工业部燃料工业管理局总工程师  谢子贞
    我本来是一个学冶金的，因解放前没有出路，就改行作煤矿工作。自一九三九年学习作煤矿工作起到现在，一直没有离开煤业工作。最初，每天听“上司”指使，叫作什么就作什么，根本没有机会参加计划和设计。当时认为计划设计是神秘的。后来当了工程师，虽然有时候作计划或设计，但是，那些计划和设计，全是坐在房子里照着“上司”的意图囫囵吞枣地说个天花乱坠，目的是为骗钱，只要是能骗得“政府”往外拿钱就算达到目的。真正作起来又是一回事，甚至于把计划完全改变。只要能自圆其说，说出一片困难就可以敷衍过去。至于设计呢，我只是片断地画上两张图，挂在墙上装装门面，其实一切都是作着给人看，对于返工和改变计划，则认为是随机应变，从来没有认为这是严重的错误。就是这种思想造成我解放后一系列的错误。
    当湖南解放时，我在湘江矿业公司任工程协理。该公司有两个煤田，一个是侏罗纪正在开采，煤已快挖完；一个是二叠纪正在钻探，有三个钻孔遇到煤层，尚未开发。解放后，矿厂部分同志向接管的负责同志建议说：侏罗纪煤田快完了，要不赶快开发二叠纪的谢家塘就接不上气了。接管的同志就同我商量。我当时怕湘江关门，自己失业，就表示同意。其实我在抗战时曾在中湘煤矿做过一年左右的工作，打了四对井，没有一个井能维持，压力之大是我搞煤矿以来所没有见过的，水也相当大。谢家塘的情况曾经过钻探，压力之大与中湘一样。当时我心里明知在现在技术水平上不能克服这个困难，但是为保持自己的饭碗，就叫矿厂上作了一套毫无把握的计划，抱着拿到钱再说的思想。中央财政经济委员会批准后，谢家塘矿就这样盲目开工了。一九五○年三月底，我被调到中南工业部工矿处工作。后来中南工业部工矿处又改组为燃料工业管理局。我在局里工作两个月后，就慢慢感到自己是不会失业的。于是才向领导同志建议，停办谢家塘矿，以免继续浪费国家资金。但是已经浪费了三亿三千多万元。这种浪费完全是由于我的自私自利和对新社会没有认识所造成的，我个人应负主要责任，并愿受政府任何处分。
    我在局里曾直接担任煤业计划工作，但是每看到中央财政经济委员会计划表就头痛，总认为这样麻烦，要浪费许多人力、物力和时间。今年四月份又看到中央财政经济委员会颁布的基本建设工作程序暂行办法的规定，认为条件定的太高太苛，若照那样执行，计划设计需要大量技术人员，需要很长时间，更要浪费人力、物力和时间！我自以为还是凭经验办事，随机应变好，这样可以开工早、完得快，既省人力又省时间，还可以提前增加生产。经过学习从六月十六日起人民日报所发表的关于基本建设的社论和文章后，才了解没有工程设计所产生的浪费，远超过我所认为的那些浪费。看了萍乡、宜洛两煤矿的基本建设检查报告，更证明了浪费现象都是由于没有周密的计划和详细的技术设计所造成。我以前所认为的浪费，正是保证消灭浪费的办法；以前认为可以为国家节省的办法，正是造成浪费的根源。
    我体会到在基本建设工作中，一个高度负责的技术人员的重要性，一个不负责任的技术人员的危险性。尤其是高级技术人员，如果马虎从事，将破坏全部工程，影响国家经济建设。技术人员们对此重大任务应予高度重视。
