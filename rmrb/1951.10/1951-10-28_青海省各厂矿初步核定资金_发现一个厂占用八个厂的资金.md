    Qinghai Province's Factories and Mines Initially Verify Capital: One Factory Found to be Using the Funds of Eight Factories
    In order to correct the serious phenomenon of capital backlog in its affiliated factories and mines, and to lay the foundation for the formal verification of capital, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Industry has initially reviewed the working capital of each factory and mine. A certain leather factory in the province was using the funds of four factories; a certain coal mine was using the funds of five mines; and a certain woolen mill was using the funds of eight factories. Since auditing capital is a new task, some leading cadres do not sufficiently recognize the importance of this work, and in the process of auditing, many biases have occurred. The most common ideological bias is the belief that "more is better than less, and leniency is better than strictness," so they try to ask for as much capital as possible and are unwilling to truly overcome the phenomenon of capital backlog. Another bias is the failure to mobilize and organize the broad masses of workers and staff to actively participate in the work of auditing capital. Although each factory and mine has established a capital verification committee or a capital verification team, they all rely on the accounting department. For example, when the accounting department of a certain power plant collected material storage data from the engineering department, the engineering department said, "You can check it! If you think it's okay, we'll agree." Another example is when the accounting department of the woolen mill convened a meeting of the planning department and cleared the warehouse, the comrade in charge of the department, who was also a member of the capital verification committee, said, "Am I still a member?" These phenomena of indifference or lack of enthusiasm for the capital verification work reflect that some leading cadres in Qinghai Province's factories and mines only pay attention to production and not to management, and mistakenly separate production and management.
    The Qinghai Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry resolutely launched an ideological struggle against the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, adopting the methods of persuasion and education and repeated audits, and finally prevented these ideas from hindering the work of verifying capital.

    青海省各厂矿初步核定资金
    发现一个厂占用八个厂的资金
    青海省工业厅为了纠正所属各厂矿严重的资金积压现象，打下正式核定资金的基础，初步审核了各厂矿的流动资金。该省某皮革厂用着四个厂的资金；某煤矿用着五个矿的资金；某毛织厂用着八个厂的资金。由于审核资金是个新的工作，某些领导干部对这一工作的重要性认识不够，在审核过程中，曾发生了不少的偏向。最普遍的思想偏向，是认为：“多比少好，宽比紧好”，因而尽量多要资金，不愿真正克服资金的积压现象。没有发动与组织广大的职工群众积极参加审核资金的工作，是另一种偏向。虽然各厂矿都成立了核定资金委员会或核定资金小组，但都抱着依靠会计科的思想。如某电厂会计科向工务科搜集材料储存量时，工务科曾说：“你们看着核吧！你们认为行，我们就同意。”又如毛织厂由会计科召集计划科开会及清仓时，该科负责同志本是核定资金委员之一，但他却说：“我还是个委员吗？”这些对于核定资金工作漠不关心或不热心的现象，反映了青海省某些厂矿领导干部只注意生产，不注意经营，错误地把生产和经营分离开了。
    青海省人民政府工业厅对上述错误思想，坚决地展开了思想斗争，采用了说服教育和反复审核的办法，终于防止了这些思想在核定资金工作中的阻碍作用。
