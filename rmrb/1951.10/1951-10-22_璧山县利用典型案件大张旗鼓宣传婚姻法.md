    Bishan County Widely Publicizes Marriage Law Using Typical Cases
    The People's Court of Bishan County, East Sichuan District, used typical marriage cases to vigorously publicize the Marriage Law. On September 17th, it held a mass rally for the public trial of the criminal Wu Guoxun, who killed his wife. (Other different types of marriage cases were also used for publicity at the meeting.) Approximately over one thousand people attended, including cadres from county, district, township, and village governments, representatives from people's organizations, and members of the public.

    This public trial was very successful because of both extensive pre-meeting publicity, such as blackboards in various villages and distribution of leaflets, and the posting of serial pictures depicting abused women committing suicide or being killed at the venue. The most important factor was the educational significance of the selected typical cases. The typical cases selected by the county included Wu Guoxun's wife-killing case, two cases of women committing suicide due to unbearable abuse, and eight general marriage cases, some of which were to be tried and others to be collectively mediated. These eight marriage cases represented various forms of the feudal marriage system, including arranged marriages, buying and selling marriages, child brides, and early marriages. The handling methods of these cases were also different: some involved one party insisting on divorce with sufficient grounds, requiring a divorce decree; others involved one party insisting on divorce but lacking legitimate grounds, making a divorce decree impossible; and others emphasized that the woman should take land and pre-marital property when the divorce was granted. According to the feedback from cadres and the masses after the public trial, this approach by the county achieved good results and resolved several major ideological issues related to marriage that existed among cadres and the masses:

    First, it vividly and comprehensively exposed the evils of the feudal marriage system, thereby arousing the attention of cadres and the masses to the implementation of the Marriage Law, especially enhancing the fighting courage of abused women, and making some people with feudal remnants realize their mistakes, abandon interference in their children's freedom of marriage, and dare not abuse their daughters-in-law or wives. Generally, cadres and the masses believed that this public trial had a great educational effect on them, clarifying that abusing women was unreasonable and illegal. In particular, the People's Court sentenced Wu Guoxun, who killed his wife, to death and immediately executed him by firing squad. The assembly believed that this was the People's Government supporting oppressed women. For example, resident Dai Guowen said, "The cases handled by the People's Court today are correct. They not only avenged the victims but also set an example so that no one dares to be so vicious again in the future." Zhou Changqing from Batang Township, Sixth District, said, "There are many evil mothers-in-law in the village, and women are afraid to speak up when they are mistreated. After attending today's meeting, I can tell them how to turn things around!" Liu Wenyu's marriage was arranged by her parents, and her mother-in-law treated her very badly. After the meeting, she said to others, "I now understand the status of women. With the Marriage Law, I am no longer afraid." Zhang Suqing was previously engaged to the son of a landlord and was very dissatisfied, but she was afraid to mention breaking off the engagement due to face-saving concerns. After attending the public trial, she wrote a letter to the other party that same day to break off the engagement.

    Second, it corrected some cadres' and the masses' misunderstanding of the freedom of marriage and correctly implemented the spirit of the Marriage Law. At the public trial, the People's Court of Bishan County combined typical marriage cases with detailed explanations of the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, such as monogamy, equality between men and women, freedom of marriage, and protection of the legitimate interests of women and children, especially the divorce issue that the masses were most concerned about. This universally improved everyone's understanding of the Marriage Law. For example, Wu Yuehua, the head of the third central section of the first district, said, "In the past, some families in each section were disharmonious and had disputes, mostly caused by the feudal marriage system. After attending this meeting and seeing many typical cases, everyone understood what kind of situation can lead to divorce and what kind cannot." A woman surnamed Xu said that she had previously heard others say that as long as she spent five hundred yuan to buy a complaint form from the court, she would definitely be able to get a divorce. Now she understood that divorce was not that easy and must comply with the provisions of the Marriage Law. Some district and village cadres, because they did not fully understand the spirit of the Marriage Law in the past, especially lacking work experience, had made some deviations when handling marriage cases. After attending this public trial, everyone felt that it was very helpful for their future work. For example, Dai De, a civil affairs cadre from the third district, said, "I used to handle marriage cases in the district and encountered many specific problems, not knowing how to solve them in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law. After seeing so many typical cases and listening to the report on the Marriage Law, I learned a lot of knowledge, and I am more confident when handling marriage cases in the future."

    璧山县利用典型案件大张旗鼓宣传婚姻法
    川东区璧山县人民法院，利用典型婚姻案件，大张旗鼓地宣传婚姻法，在九月十七日召开了公审杀死妻子的罪犯吴国勋的群众大会。（会上同时用其他不同类型的婚姻案件进行了宣传。）到会的有县、区、乡、村政权干部、人民团体的代表和群众约一千余人。
    这次公审大会开得很成功。原因是不仅在会前进行了广泛宣传，例如在各村出黑板报，散发传单，并在会场上张贴妇女受虐待自杀或被杀的连环画，最主要的是选择的典型案件富有教育意义。该县所选择的典型案件有吴国勋杀妻案和两起妇女不堪虐待而自杀的案件，还有八个一般的婚姻案件，其中有些是要审判的，有些是要集体调解的。这八个婚姻案件代表了封建婚姻制度的各种形式，有包办婚姻，有买卖婚姻，有童养媳以及早婚等。这些案件在处理方法上也是各不相同的：有的是一方坚持离婚，而有充分理由，必须判决离婚的；也有的虽一方坚持离婚，但理由不正当，不能判决离婚的；还有着重说明判决离婚时女方应带土地及婚前财产的。根据公审大会后干部和群众的反应，该县这种作法收到了很好的效果，解决了干部和群众中所存在的有关婚姻方面的几个主要思想问题：
    第一、鲜明地、较全面地暴露了封建婚姻制度的罪恶，因而引起了干部和群众对贯彻执行婚姻法的重视，特别是增强了遭受虐待的妇女的斗争勇气，并使一些有封建残余思想的人认识到自己的错误，放弃了对于儿女婚姻自由的干涉，不敢再虐待自己的儿媳或妻子。一般干部和群众都认为这次公审大会对自己有很大的教育作用，明白了虐待妇女是不合理的、犯法的，特别是人民法院判处杀死妻子的吴国勋以死刑，并当场执行枪决，大会认为这是人民政府给受压迫的妇女撑了腰。如居民戴国文说：“人民法院今天处理的案子是对头的，不但为被害的群众报了仇，而且可以作个榜样，今后任何人也不敢再这样凶恶了。”六区八塘乡周长清说：“村里恶婆婆很多，妇女受了气不敢提。今天参加了大会，我可以告诉她们怎样翻身了！”妇女刘文玉的婚姻是父母包办的，婆婆待她很不好。她在会后向人说：“我现在明白了妇女的地位，有了婚姻法，以后我不害怕了。”妇女张素清从前和一个地主的儿子订了婚，自己很不满意，但因碍于面子，不敢提退婚的事；这次参加公审大会以后，她当天回去就给对方写信退婚。
    第二、纠正了一部分干部和群众对婚姻自由的错误认识，正确地贯彻了婚姻法的精神。该县人民法院在公审大会上，把婚姻法的基本精神，如一夫一妻制、男女平等、婚姻自由、保护妇女及子女的合法利益等，特别是群众顾虑最多的离婚问题，都结合典型的婚姻案件作了详细的解释，普遍地提高了大家对于婚姻法的认识。如一区第三中心段段长吴月华说：“以往各段有些家庭不和睦，闹纠纷，多是因封建婚姻制度所引起的。这次参加了大会，看了许多典型案件以后，大家懂得了什么样的可以离婚，什么样的不能离婚了。”有一姓徐的妇女说，她以前听别人说只要花五百元到法院买份状纸，就一定可以离婚；现在她明白了离婚并不是那样容易的事，必须合乎婚姻法的规定。一些区、村干部因为过去不很了解婚姻法的精神，特别是缺乏工作经验，因而在处理婚姻案件时曾发生一些偏差，这次参加了公审大会，大家都觉得对于今后的工作有很大帮助。如三区民政干事戴德说：“我以前在区处理婚姻案件，碰见许多具体问题，不知道怎样解决才合乎婚姻法的精神；这次看见了这样多的典型案子，又听了关于婚姻法的报告，使我学习了不少的知识，回去后再处理婚姻案件，就有把握了。”
