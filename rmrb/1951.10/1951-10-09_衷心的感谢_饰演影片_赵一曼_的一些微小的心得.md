Heartfelt Thanks
—Some Small Insights on Playing the Role of "Zhao Yiman"
Shi Lianxing

Thanks to the education and nurturing of the Party and Chairman Mao, which have given me the direction to strive for in my acting career, I was awarded the Outstanding Acting Award at the Fifth International Film Festival for playing the martyr Zhao Yiman. This honor belongs to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the Chinese people.

I will never forget that in 1932, in the backyard of the Central Democratic Government in Ruijin, at an evening party commemorating the Soviet October Revolution, I played a Soviet girl. From that moment on, I began my life as an actress. Later, in the Workers' and Peasants' Drama Society and at the Gorky Drama School, the Party constantly educated me: to overcome petty-bourgeois consciousness, to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to patiently help the worker-peasant elements in the drama school, and to humbly learn from them. The Party always taught us to listen to the masses' opinions on performances and to closely integrate the programs performed with current political tasks. It was in this way that we progressed day by day under the Party's guidance.

During the guerrilla war, the Party repeatedly taught us to go deep into the countryside and the Red Army, to use the weapon of art to propagate the Party's policies, to strengthen the masses' confidence in the revolution, and to inspire the fighting will of the soldiers. In those days of arduous struggle, we often performed for the Red Army a few hours before they fought the enemy. After watching the plays, the soldiers optimistically, firmly, and with unparalleled courage threw themselves into battle. Their heroic actions educated us actors, filling us with a belief in victory, and we marched towards victory with them. The Party instructed: "Not only must you be an artistic worker, but also a strong Red fighter!" We actors in the Red Army were so happy to wear the Red Army vests and black shorts of the dance troupe, holding red-tasseled spears in our hands, following the队伍（d队伍） to climb mountains and cross countless layers of enemy blockades. I will never forget how many heroic and advanced proletarian fighters, in order to crush the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and resist Japan in the north, shed their last drop of blood! At that time, how the Red fighters who remained in Jiangxi missed Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and their close comrades-in-arms! We firmly believed that only by fighting and fighting again would victory surely be ours!

Today, the beloved Party and dear Chairman Mao lead the Chinese people to achieve national victory and establish the great People's Republic of China. Things that did not exist in the past now exist, and things that were not understood or familiar in the past must now be learned.

Under the leadership of the Party and the care of Chairman Mao, the people's film industry of the new China is progressing rapidly. I am a new recruit, a naive first-grader, among film workers. My childhood in this career is happy, beautiful, and the future is bright. When I officially attended my first lesson, which was when I accepted the role of the martyr Zhao Yiman, how happy I was in my heart! I was determined to complete this glorious task well.

What learning process did I go through to obtain the image of the martyr Zhao Yiman? First of all, with a heart that loves the Party, the motherland, and Comrade Zhao Yiman, I opened the door to welcome the role. I met the role with an honest and sincere attitude and began to approach the role with an attitude of humbly learning from Comrade Zhao Yiman.

I carefully read the script and consulted the author and director to understand their intentions and plans for the film, and then began further preparations. I looked at reference books and films, listened to reports, conducted interviews, and recalled the heroic images I had seen in films in the past, as well as recalling and searching for things related to the role and related thoughts and feelings that I had come into contact with in my own life. The image of the martyr Zhao Yiman was formed with the prompting of many Communist Party members who possessed noble qualities. I thought of our outstanding women leaders Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, Kang Keqing, and others. Although I did not have much contact with them, their loyalty to the Party, their strong fighting spirit, humble attitude, loyalty and perseverance to the revolutionary cause, and high level of work ability in serving the people are good examples for us women, and they are also the noble qualities possessed by the female revolutionary Zhao Yiman. I also recalled Comrade Liu Bojian, who sacrificed himself in the Jiangxi guerrilla war. He was unyielding and calmly faced death, shouting "Long live the Communist Party!" before his execution! This call of truth is immortal. This call was also the heroic call of the martyr Zhao Yiman before her execution. I remembered many comrades, both alive and sacrificed, and my role was nourished by her (his) blood.

I also studied the history of the Anti-Japanese United Army and listened to Comrade Feng Zhongyun's report on the Anti-Japanese United Army, which enabled me to understand the characteristics of the historical era of the role and made me more clearly understand the era and living basis for creating the image of Comrade Zhao Yiman; it made me understand how they went through hardships in the struggle, tasted all the hardships, and still fought bravely and resolutely against the Japanese invaders in the white mountains and black waters, in the icy and snowy world, until they ate tree bark and grass roots. The heroes stood on the peaks of the motherland's northeast, seeing with their own eyes the beautiful land of the motherland illuminated by the sun, where the Japanese invaders were rampant everywhere, villages were reduced to fire, and the people were subjected to cruel massacres. How angry were the heroes! For the sake of our dear compatriots, for the sake of the sacred land of the motherland, for the sake of human survival, for the sake of the Party's noble and just cause, the heroes fought bravely! They shed their last drop of blood for the survival of the motherland! The patriotism of heroes and martyrs such as Yang Jingyu, Deng Tiemei, Zhao Shangzhi, and Zhao Yiman will forever live in the hearts of the people!

In the Harbin Martyrs' Memorial Hall, with boundless reverence, I stood silently in front of the martyr's portrait, silently in front of General Yang Jingyu's head, silently in the interrogation room where the enemy interrogated Comrade Zhao Yiman. My heart was filled with irrepressible grief and hatred for the class enemy! I silently swore to the martyrs that I would learn from their boundless loyalty to the revolution, overcome my shortcomings, and dedicate everything to the revolution. I felt that the martyrs' blood was flowing in my veins. I also learned about the situation of Comrade Zhao Yiman in the hospital after her capture from Dr. Zhang (now Deputy Minister of the Health Department of Harbin). Comrade Zhao Yiman was not only an outstanding communist propagandist, but also a talented organizer. Her loyalty to the revolution aroused the patriotism of doctors and nurses. Under the care of the masses, she broke through the enemy's surveillance, and the masses carried her out of the hospital on a stretcher to escape. … The image of Zhao Yiman grew strongly in my creative thoughts.

The Czech Communist Party member Julius Fučík's posthumous work "Report from the Gallows" also gave me strength in my creation. The hero's confession is full of a revolutionary fighter's extreme contempt and hatred for the enemy. What he cares about is not his personal life, but the motherland and the people, the victory of the Soviet Union, and the liberation of the oppressed nations. He firmly believes that peace will surely triumph over war, but peace must be won through struggle. In his diary before his execution, he wrote: "People, I love you, you must be vigilant!" What moving words of teaching! The qualities of communists all over the world are the same. Like Sister Shuai in Li Bozhao's "Female Communist Party Member", the air force hero in the Soviet film, Volina in "The Rainbow", and the famous heroine Tanya… These Chinese and foreign heroes and revolutionaries, their thoughts, words, and actions, played a major and decisive role in my creation of the image of Comrade Zhao Yiman, a highly disciplined Chinese Communist Party member and a good daughter of the Chinese people. As for my own life experiences and experiences, they are also inseparable from the specific behavior and actions of the role. It is very necessary to recall the details of each relevant stage in my own experience.

The part of the film where the martyr Zhao Yiman worked underground in Harbin is based on my work in a people's organization led by the Shanghai Party in 1932 and my life experience in the White Area.

The part of Zhao Yiman in the countryside is based on my life experience with the Red Army and the masses in the Central Red Area and the guerrilla war. I used the experience that the Red Army is the son of workers and peasants, and that the Red Army is a conscious team fighting for the truth, to deal with my role's relationship with the masses and to understand the love of the people of Northeast China for the Anti-Japanese United Army. In 1947, my participation in land reform work once again made me deeply realize the love of the peasants for the Party, the people's government, and the revolutionary cadres, which inspired me to obtain the spirit of Comrade Zhao Yiman's approach to the peasants in the countryside and the spirit of correctly implementing the Party's tasks.

The part of Zhao Yiman in the army is also based on my life experience in the Red Army. The Party leads the worker-peasant soldiers to bravely kill the enemy for their own liberation. The officers and soldiers are united to achieve their lofty ideals, share joys and sorrows, and rely on the masses to achieve victory. This is the creative basis for my performance of Comrade Zhao Yiman in the armed struggle.

The part of Zhao Yiman in the enemy's prison, in court, and on the execution ground, I began to feel very difficult in the creation, because my life experience could not fully grasp the spirit of the role; but the emotions of longing for the Party, comrades-in-arms, and the great War of Resistance Against Japan were still full in me. During the long period after I was captured by the enemy in the war and then released, I had always longed for the Party and the troops led by the Party. In the creation, I repeatedly recalled these things, and the emotions at that time rekindled in my heart. I also received great help from Comrade Bai Dafang's account of his life in Xinjiang Prison. At the same time, the feelings given to me by Sister Shuai, Tanya, Volina, Fučík… gradually relieved me of my difficulties. In many scenes of Zhao Yiman's confession in prison, being tortured, walking out of prison, and calmly going to justice, I concentrated all my mind and body on the mood of loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, and loving the people to perform; and completed my work with unlimited class hatred, contempt, and hatred for the enemy. Today, the victory of the people of the motherland makes me feel proud in front of the enemy, and the Party and Chairman Mao give me endless strength. Chairman Mao is victory! Chairman Mao is light! My heart is open, my eyes have brilliance, my injured leg has strength, I proudly raise my head and move forward victoriously, forward!

In this way, after eight months of filming, I worked bit by bit, scene by scene. At the end of the last scene, I deeply felt that this was the real beginning of creation. At this time, I understood a little bit about the meaning of creation. In the work, I got a clear concept: only by continuing to transform myself in the work can I combine with the thoughts and feelings of the role. I have many shortcomings, and I must study, study, and study again! Exercise, exercise, and exercise again!

Pay tribute to the Party's good daughter, the national heroine of the Chinese nation, and the Chinese Communist Party member Zhao Yiman! Thank you from the bottom of my heart, because I played you and received your education! (Attached picture)

### 衷心的感谢——饰演影片“赵一曼”的一些微小的心得

    衷心的感谢
    ——饰演影片“赵一曼”的一些微小的心得
    石联星
    感谢党和毛主席的教导和培养，在我的演剧工作上，给我指示了努力的方向，使我因饰演赵一曼烈士而荣获第五届国际电影赛会的优等演技奖。这光荣是属于党，属于毛主席和中国人民的。
    我永不会忘记，一九三二年在瑞金中央民主政府后院，纪念苏联十月革命节的晚会上，我饰演一个苏联女孩。从那时起，我开始了我的演员生活。以后在工农剧社里，在高尔基戏剧学校里，党时刻教育我：要克服小资产阶级意识，要为工农兵服务，要耐心地帮助剧校的工农分子，要虚心向他们学习。党总是教导我们，要倾听群众对演出的意见，演出的节目要与当前政治任务紧密地结合。就是这样，我们在党的教导下一天天地进步。
    在游击战争中，党又再三地教导我们要深入到农村和红军中去，用艺术的武器宣传党的政策，坚定群众对革命的信心，鼓舞战士们的战斗意志。在那些艰苦斗争的日子里，我们常在红军与敌人作战的前几小时为红军演出，战士们看完戏后，乐观地、坚定地、无比勇敢地投向战斗。他们的英勇行为教育着我们演员们，使我们满怀胜利信念，和他们一起走向胜利。党指示：“不仅要做个艺术工作者，而且要做个坚强的红色战士！”我们在红军中的演员们是那样高兴地穿着红背心、黑短裤的舞装，手里拿着红缨枪，紧跟着队伍爬山越岭，冲过了无数层的敌人封锁网。我永远不会忘记，在战争中有多少英勇先进的无产阶级战士，为了粉碎蒋介石匪帮，北上抗日而流尽他们最后一滴血！当时留在江西的红色战士们是如何想念着毛主席，想念着党中央，想念着骨肉相连的战友啊！我们坚信只有战斗、再战斗，胜利一定是我们的！
    今天，亲爱的党，亲爱的毛主席领导着中国人民，取得了全国的胜利，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国。过去没有的东西今天都有了，过去不懂得的，不熟悉的东西今天都要学习。
    新中国的人民电影事业，在党的领导下，在毛主席的关怀下正在一日千里地进步着。我是电影工作者之中的一个新兵，一个幼稚的一年级生，我的这个事业的童年是幸福的，美丽的，前途是远大的。当我正式上第一堂课时，也就是接受了饰演赵一曼烈士的角色时，我的内心是怎样地喜悦啊！我决心要很好地完成这一光荣任务。
    我经过怎样的学习过程而得到赵一曼烈士的形象呢？首先我是以爱党，爱祖国，爱赵一曼同志的心，打开了迎接角色的大门，以老实诚恳的态度和角色见面，以向赵一曼同志虚心学习的态度与角色开始接近的。
    我熟读剧本，并向作者、导演请教，了解作者、导演对影片的意图和计划，然后开始进一步的准备工作。看参考书籍、参考影片，听报告，访问以及回想过去所看过的影片中的英雄形象，回忆和寻找自己生活中所接触到的，与角色有关的事物，以及有联系的思想感情。赵一曼烈士的形象，是受到许多具备着高贵品质的共产党员的形象的提示而形成的。我想到了我们杰出的妇女领袖蔡畅、邓颖超、康克清等同志，虽然我与她们接触得不多，但她们对党的忠诚，她们的坚强的斗志，谦虚的态度，对革命事业的忠心与毅力，以及为人民服务的高度工作能力，是我们妇女的好榜样，也是女革命家赵一曼同志所具有的高贵品质。我又回忆到在江西游击战争中牺牲的刘伯坚同志，他坚强不屈，从容就义，临刑前高呼“共产党万岁”！这个真理的呼声是永世不灭的。这个呼声也正是赵一曼烈士就义前壮烈的呼声。我忆念着很多健在的和已经牺牲了的同志，我的角色受到了她（他）们的血液的养育。
    我又研读了抗联奋斗史册，听取了冯仲云同志关于抗联的报告，使我对角色的历史时代的特色有了了解，使我更明确了创造赵一曼同志形象的时代和生活的根据；使我理解到一些他们是怎样在斗争中历尽艰险，尝尽辛苦，在白山黑水之间，冰天雪地之中，直到吃树皮草根，仍旧坚贞英勇地与日寇战斗。英雄们站在祖国东北的山巅，眼看到阳光普照的祖国美丽的土地上，日寇在到处横行，村庄沦入火海，人民遭受残酷的屠杀，英雄们是多么愤怒啊！为了亲爱的同胞，为了神圣的祖国的土地，为了人类的生存，为了党的崇高正义的事业，英雄们坚强地战斗着！他们为祖国的生存流尽了最后一滴血！像杨靖宇、邓铁梅、赵尚志、赵一曼等英雄烈士们的爱国主义精神，是永远活在人民心中的！
    在哈尔滨烈士馆，我怀着无限崇敬的心情，默立在烈士的遗像前，默立在杨静宇将军遗首前，默立在曾是敌人审讯赵一曼同志的审讯室里，我的心里燃起了难以抑制的悲痛和对阶级敌人的仇恨！我默默地向烈士们宣誓，要学习烈士们对革命的无限的忠心，要克服自己的缺点，把一切都献给革命。我觉得烈士们的鲜血在我的血脉内流注着。我又从影片中的张大夫（现为哈尔滨市卫生部副部长）那里，了解了赵一曼同志被捕后在医院的情况。赵一曼同志不但是出色的共产主义宣传家，而且是一位具有才干的组织者。她对革命的忠心，激起了医生、护士的爱国心，她在群众的爱护下，冲破敌人的监视，群众用担架将她抬出医院逃走。……赵一曼的形象强烈地在我的创作思想里生长着。
    捷克共产党员伏契克的遗作“绞索套着脖子时的报告”，对我的创作也给予了力量。英雄的自白，充满了一个革命战士对敌人极端的卑视与憎恨。他所关心的不是他个人的生命，而是祖国与人民，苏联的胜利与被压迫民族的解放。他坚信和平一定会战胜战争，但是和平是要用斗争去取得的。在他就义前的日记中写道：“人们，我是爱你们的，你们可要警惕啊！”这是何等动人的教言啊！全世界共产党员的品质是具有同一性的。又如李伯钊同志著的“女共产党员”中的帅大姐，苏联影片中的空军英雄，“虹”中的沃琳娜，和著名的女英雄丹娘……这些中国的、外国的英雄们、革命家们的思想语言行动，都给予我在创造这位具有高度党性的中国共产党员、中国人民的好女儿赵一曼同志的形象时，起了重大的、决定性的作用。至于我自身的生活经历和体验，对于角色的具体行为、动作，也是不可分开的。回忆自己经历中每个有关阶段的细节是十分必要的。
    影片中赵一曼烈士在哈尔滨地下工作的部分，是以我在一九三二年参加上海党领导的一个人民团体的工作，和我在白区的生活经历为基础的。
    赵一曼在农村中的部分，是以我在中央红区和游击战争中与红军及群众的生活经历为基础的。我以红军是工农的儿子，红军是一支自觉的为真理而战斗的队伍的体验，来处理我的角色与群众的关系，来理解东北人民对抗日联军的热爱。一九四七年我参加土地改革工作，使我又一次较深地体会到农民对党、对人民政权及对革命干部的热爱，启发我得到赵一曼同志在农村中与农民接近的精神和正确执行党的任务的精神。
    赵一曼在部队中的部分，也是以我在红军中的生活体验为基础的。党领导工农子弟兵，为求自己解放，奋勇杀敌，官兵一致为实现崇高理想，同甘苦，共患难，依靠群众，取得了胜利。这就是我演赵一曼同志在武装斗争中的创作根据。
    赵一曼在敌人监狱里、法庭里、刑场上的部分，在创作时我开始感到很困难，因为我的生活经历还不能充分地掌握到角色的精神；但是对党和战友们及对伟大的抗日战争的向往的情绪，在我身上还是充溢着的。当我在战争中被敌俘去又被释放后的长时间里，我一直是向往着党和党领导的队伍。在创作中我一再回忆这些，在我的内心上复燃起当时的情感。我也从白大方同志讲述他在新疆监狱中的生活中获得很大的帮助，同时帅大姐、丹娘、沃琳娜、伏契克……给予我的感受，使我渐渐解除了困难。赵一曼在狱中的自白，受刑，走出监狱，从容就义的许多镜头，我是把全副身心集中在热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱人民的心情来饰演的；并且以无限的阶级仇恨、卑视与憎恨敌人的情绪来完成我的工作。今天祖国人民的胜利，使我在敌人面前感到骄傲，党和毛主席给我以无穷的力量。毛主席就是胜利！毛主席就是光明！我的心里开朗了，眼睛有了光彩了，受伤的腿有了劲了，我傲然地仰着头胜利前进，前进！
    这样经过八个月的拍制过程，我一点一滴地，一个镜头一个镜头地工作着。在最后一个镜头结束时，我深深感到这才是真正创作的开始，这时候，我才懂到了一点创作的意义。在工作中我得到了一个明确的观念：只有在工作中继续改造自己，才能与角色的思想感情结合。我自身的缺点很多，我必须要学习，学习，再学习！锻炼，锻炼，再锻炼！
    向党的好儿女、中华民族女英雄、中国共产党员赵一曼同志致敬！衷心地感谢你，因为我扮演了你，受到了你的教育！（附图片）
