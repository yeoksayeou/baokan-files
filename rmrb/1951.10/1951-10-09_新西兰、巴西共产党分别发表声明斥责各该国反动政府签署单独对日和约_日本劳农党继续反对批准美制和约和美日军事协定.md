Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Communist Parties of New Zealand and Brazil have both issued statements condemning their respective reactionary governments for signing the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan, and calling on the people to rise up and defend peace. According to a Telepress report from the 1st: The Secretariat of the Communist Party of New Zealand issued a statement pointing out: The signing of the separate peace treaty with Japan is a naked admission by the American warmongers that their intention is: Regardless of whether other countries in the world are willing, the United States wants to rearm Japan economically and militarily. The statement said: "Only one thing can stop this crime, and that is the united action of the people." According to a TASS report from Montevideo on September 30th: The Executive Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party published a statement in "The People's Paper" "Regarding the Peace Treaty with Japan," saying: "Our people are prepared to defend their national sovereignty to the end. Under no circumstances can they agree that the traitors of the ruling class represent Brazil in signing such war documents." The statement condemned Brazilian President Vargas for ordering the Brazilian delegation to sign the separate peace treaty with Japan, which is a crime against the motherland and another act of enmity towards the vast majority of the people. The statement called on the Brazilian people to intensify their struggle for peace and to intensify the collection of signatures for the Peace Covenant Declaration.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a TASS report from the 5th: The Japanese newspaper "Labor-Farmer News" reported that the Japanese Labor-Farmer Party issued a protest letter opposing the separate peace treaty with Japan signed in San Francisco. The protest letter said: "The Japanese government delegation headed by Yoshida, which participated in the San Francisco Conference, signed a humiliating treaty for Japan, disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people. Not only that, but Yoshida also brazenly signed the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,' which is a serious threat to peace in Asia, deprives our country of its sovereignty, and places our country completely under foreign military control. Our party will continue to fight against the ratification of these treaties and for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan."

According to the "Chubu Nippon" newspaper, the Nagoya City authorities prohibited students from holding a meeting scheduled for September 29th to protest the signing of the separate peace treaty.

The Yoshida government is resorting to tricks in the Diet to prevent the people from seeing the aggressive nature of the military agreement of the so-called "Security Treaty." "Asahi Shimbun" revealed: The government intends to conduct an "explanation" of the aforementioned military agreement in a secret meeting of the Diet committee from which Communist Party members are excluded, rather than doing so in a plenary session of the Diet.

    斥责各该国反动政府签署单独对日和约
    日本劳农党继续反对批准美制和约和美日军事协定
    【新华社六日讯】新西兰共产党和巴西共产党都发表声明，斥责各该国反动政府在旧金山对日和约上签字，并号召人民起来保卫和平。据电通社一日讯：新西兰共产党书记处发表的声明指出：单独对日和约的签订，是美国战争贩子赤裸裸地供认他们的用意是：不管世界其他各国是否愿意，美国要把日本在经济、军事方面重新武装起来。声明说：“只有一件东西可以制止这种罪行，那就是人民的一致行动。”另据塔斯社蒙得维的亚九月三十日讯：巴西共产党执行委员会在“人民报”刊载的“关于对日和约”的声明说：“我们的人民准备保卫他们的国家主权到底。他们在任何情况下不能同意统治阶级的卖国贼们代表巴西签署这类战争的文件。”声明斥责巴西总统瓦尔加斯下令巴西代表团签订单独对日和约，是犯了反对祖国的罪行，和再一次与绝大多数的人民为敌。声明号召巴西人民加紧为争取和平而斗争；加紧为和平公约宣言征集签名。
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社五日讯：日本报纸“劳农新闻”消息，日本劳农党发表抗议书，反对在旧金山签订的单独对日和约。抗议书说：“以吉田为首的参加旧金山会议的日本政府代表团，不顾日本人民大众的反对，签订了使日本蒙羞的和约。不仅如此，吉田还肆无忌惮地签订了日美‘安全条约’，这个条约对亚洲和平是一个严重的威胁，它剥夺了我国的主权，把我国完全置于外国的军事控制之下。我党将继续为反对批准这些条约和争取缔结全面对日和约而奋斗。”
    据“中部日本”报讯，名古屋市当局禁止学生举行预定在九月二十九日召开的抗议签订单独和约的会议。
    吉田政府为了不让人民看到所谓“安全条约”的军事协定的侵略性质，正在国会中耍手腕。“朝日新闻”透露：政府打算在共产党议员不得参加的国会委员会秘密会议上，对上述军事协定进行
    “解释”，而不愿在国会全体会议中这样做。
