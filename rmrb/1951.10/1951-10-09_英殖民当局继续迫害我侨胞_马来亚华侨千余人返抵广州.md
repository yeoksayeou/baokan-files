Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 8th. The twelfth and thirteenth groups of overseas Chinese, totaling 1,140 people, who were unreasonably deported by the British colonial government of Malaya, returned to Guangzhou by ship on September 12th and October 6th, respectively. These distressed overseas Chinese had been detained for a long time in concentration camps by the British colonial authorities and subjected to torture and abuse. Li Xuemei, a housewife with three children, had been put in an ice room, waterboarded, and bitten by wolves and dogs. Wu Tianbao, a machine worker, suffered multiple beatings during his three years and two months of detention and contracted a serious illness. When these distressed overseas Chinese arrived in Guangzhou, they were warmly greeted and properly resettled by the local overseas Chinese affairs agencies.

    英殖民当局继续迫害我侨胞
    马来亚华侨千余人返抵广州
    【新华社广州八日电】被马来亚英国殖民政府无理驱逐出境的第十二、十三批华侨共一千一百四十人，在九月十二日和本月六日先后乘轮返抵广州。这些难侨都曾被英国殖民当局长期拘禁在集中营里，备受酷刑和虐待。像有三个孩子的家庭妇女李雪梅，曾坐过冰房、被灌过水、被狼狗咬过。机器工人伍天保在被拘禁的三年两个月中，曾遭受多次殴打，患了重病。这些难侨抵达广州时，受到当地侨务机关的热烈慰问和妥当安置。
