Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The fact that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, bravely fighting in Korea, is growing stronger in battle is something even the enemy has to admit. According to a Reuters dispatch from the Korean front on the 13th, staff officers of the U.S. aggressor army and British accomplice troops in Korea jointly believe that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's "organizational techniques, deployment, and use of firepower are all first-rate." They believe: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army "has better training than at any other time, and has many more weapons, especially artillery." Reuters said, "Van Fleet's troops are currently encountering an iron defense line."

The dispatch stated: "The Chinese army has always been regarded as a tough, hard-working enemy with excellent individual skills. But now, their frontline soldiers seem to have the support of field guns of various types and calibers," and possess excellent "administrative management." The U.S. and British aggressor forces are particularly afraid of the Volunteer Army's artillery power. The dispatch stated, "In the past, Allied soldiers could freely travel by car or on foot between the outposts of various companies and battalion headquarters, but those days are gone forever." They are now beginning to feel the "full force" of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's increasingly powerful "artillery." "Everyone believes that the Chinese gunners are first-rate gunners. Their artillery is very cleverly camouflaged, and they only move positions at night. Therefore, they are simply like small needles hidden in haystacks in the deep mountains, dense forests, and densely wooded valleys."

The dispatch also stated: "The Chinese army also seems to have improved their communication system. They now have excellent radio and telephone lines all the way to the front line units. Despite constant bombing by Allied aircraft and intensive artillery attacks, the Chinese Communist forces are still able to continue to receive supplies."

The dispatch quoted an example cited by a staff officer of the 25th Canadian Brigade regarding the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's attack on the Canadian Princess Patricia's Light Infantry on the night of the 12th and admitted: This attack "made the Patricia's experience one of their most horrific night battles." The dispatch said fearfully: "In summary, for those fighting in these mountains, the Communist forces are more formidable than they were six months ago. According to the best estimates of frontline Allied officers, the serious fact is that the United Nations will have to pay a heavy price to achieve even a little bit of progress."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The tenacious blocking and counter-attack battles waged by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies are inflicting severe casualties and blows on the U.S. aggressor army, which has been launching frantic offensives while the U.S. side is delaying and obstructing negotiations. An Associated Press dispatch from the headquarters of the U.S. Eighth Army on the 13th admitted: In an offensive launched by the U.S. and Syngman Rhee's troops in the Korean central sector, "the veteran U.S. 7th Regiment was severely crushed by waves of Communist attacks." The dispatch admitted: Under the "devastating attack" of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, only "a small portion of the troops and a few individuals" of the supposedly "veteran" U.S. 7th Regiment "escaped back."

Meanwhile, in the eastern part of the Korean central sector, according to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th, citing a communique from the U.S. Eighth Army: "Intense counter-attacks by the Communist forces forced the exhausted United Nations forces to abandon the main peak of 'Heartbreak Ridge' on the 12th." When the U.S. aggressor army temporarily occupied that peak at the cost of heavy casualties, they had "thought that that battle was the last battle"; however, the heroic Korean and Chinese People's Armies immediately recovered the peak. The dispatch admitted: "This happened only a few hours after the Allied forces had secured the peak."

United Press, in summarizing the U.S. aggressor army's adventurous incursions in the eastern part of the central sector, said helplessly: "After a month of strategic hill battles in the mountains northeast of Yanggu in central eastern Korea, the Allied forces were forced to abandon their positions again." It sadly said: "This once again proves that the name 'Heartbreak Ridge' is very appropriate."

    中国人民志愿军愈战愈强
    侵略军参谋人员慑于我军威力深为惶恐
    美方消息承认美军在朝鲜中线遭我严重打击和杀伤
    【新华社十六日讯】在朝鲜英勇作战的中国人民志愿军愈战愈强的事实，连敌人都不得不承认。据路透社朝鲜前线十三日电，侵朝美军和英国帮凶军的参谋人员共同认为，中国人民志愿军的“编制技术、部署和火力的使用都是第一等的”。他们认为：中国人民志愿军“有着比任何时期都为优良的训练，并且有着多得很多的武器，特别是大炮”。路透社说“目前范佛里特的军队遇到了铁一般的防线”。
    该消息说：“中国军一向被视为顽强、能吃苦、个人技术优良的敌人。但是现在，他们的前线士兵似乎有着各种类型与各种口径的野炮的支援。”并且有着优秀的“行政管理”。美英侵略军对志愿军的炮兵威力，尤其害怕。该消息说，“从前联军士兵在前哨各连各营指挥所之间乘车或步行自由来往，可是现在这种日子是一去不复返了。”他们现在开始感到中国人民志愿军日益增强的“大炮威力”的“全部力量”。“大家认为中国炮手是头等的炮手。他们的大炮都有很巧妙的伪装，只在夜间才移动位置，因此，它们就简直等于藏在深山密林和树丛密布的山谷的草堆里的一根根小针。”
    该消息并称：“中国军队似乎也改善了他们的通讯体系。他们现在有很好的无线电和电话一直通到前沿阵地各部队。尽管联军飞机不断地轰炸，联军大炮进行密集攻击，但共军却仍能继续获得供应。”
    该消息引述了加拿大军第二十五旅的参谋举出的十二日夜中国人民志愿军对加军巴特里亚西公主轻步兵队的进攻的例子后承认：这次进攻，“使巴特里亚西队经历了他们经验中最惨烈的一次夜间战斗”。该消息惶恐地说：“总而言之，对于那些在这一带群山中作战的人来说，共产党部队是比六个月前更为厉害了。根据前线联军军官的最好的估计，目前严重的事实是：联合国要付出重大的代价才能取得一点点的进展。”
    【新华社十六日讯】朝、中人民军队所进行的坚强阻击战和反击战，正给予在美方拖延和阻挠谈判期间疯狂发动进攻的美国侵略军以严重的杀伤和打击。美联社记者十三日自美国第八军总部发出的一条消息承认：美、李匪军在朝鲜中线发动的一次进攻中，“美国老牌第七团，被共军攻击的浪潮严重地击溃了。”该消息承认：在朝、中人民军队的“粉碎性的攻击”下，号称“老牌”的美军第七团“只有一小部分队伍和个别的人逃回来”。
    同时，在朝鲜中线东部，据合众社东京十三日电引美国第八军的公报说：“激烈反攻的共军迫使疲惫的联合国军在十二日放弃‘伤心岭’的主峰。”当美国侵略军在付出了重大的伤亡代价暂时侵占那个山峰时，他们曾“以为那一次战斗是最后的一场战斗”；但是，英勇的朝、中人民军队随即收复了该山峰，该消息承认：“这只是在联军获得该峰数小时以后的事。”
    合众社在总结美国侵略军在中线东部的冒险进犯时，无可奈何地说：“在杨口以北朝鲜中部偏东山岭中，经过了一个月的战略山头的争夺战，联军被迫再度放弃阵地。”它悲哀地说：“这次再度证明‘伤心岭’的取名是非常适当的。”
