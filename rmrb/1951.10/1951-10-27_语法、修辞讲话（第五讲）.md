Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 5)
    Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi

Eighth Paragraph: Miscellaneous Examples of Rhetoric

    Inappropriate Metaphors. When using one thing to compare to another, there must be a similarity between the two; otherwise, the comparison is impossible. The following metaphors are inappropriate and feel out of place:

    (1) The humiliating footprints of the Chinese people will never be seen on the river again—those warships flying the flags of other countries. (Periodical)
    (2) The back wave pushes the front wave, from one group to one workshop to the entire factory. (Periodical)
    (3) The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is closely consolidated by the Yalu River, just like the endless flow of the river! (Periodical)
    (4) I want to give my bright red life to 1951 without leaving a single blank space. (Newspaper)
    (5) They also use the United Nations as an air-raid shelter, as a bunker to cover attacks on the people and peace. (Periodical)
    (6) She called on comrades to strive to make a point in each stroke of the word "great" with their actions. (Manuscript)
    (7) Especially in the past ten years, with the widespread prevalence of Keynesian economics, many game-like exercises in writing have been done in chapters related to employment, consumption, investment, and interest. (Periodical)

    (1) There will never be footprints on the river. It is also inappropriate to compare warships to footprints. (2) The back wave pushing the front wave is a progression. From one group to one workshop, and then to the entire factory, is an expansion of scope, and cannot be compared. (3) The endless flow of the river only indicates the duration of time and has nothing to do with whether it is "consolidated." (4) "Life without blank space" is difficult to understand. Life does not have color either. What is "bright red life"? In addition, a blank space is not a liquid. One should not say "a drop," but "a blank area." (5) An air-raid shelter is a place to take refuge, and a bunker is a defensive stronghold. The connotations of the two metaphors are inconsistent. "As an air-raid shelter" and the following comma should be deleted. (6) "A point in each stroke" is difficult to understand. "With their actions" is also unnecessary. Changing it to "She called on comrades to strive to be a stroke in the word 'great'" is slightly better, but still strange. (7) Writing is not a game, so how can one say "game-like exercises in writing"? The author means to say "did a lot of word games."

    Incorrect Tone.

    (8) Under the high pressure of the American and Japanese reactionaries, the number of Japanese people signing for peace reached more than six million, which is clear evidence. (Periodical)
    (9) With the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people suffered unprecedented hardships. (Newspaper)

    (8) From the tone, it seems that the large number of signatories is due to the high pressure of the reactionaries, which is naturally not the case. Changing it to "Although under the pressure of the American and Japanese reactionaries... there are still more than six million people signing...", the tone is more appropriate. (9) Since there was victory, there should be no more suffering. The suffering of the Chinese people was not due to the victory of the War of Resistance, but to the reckless behavior of the reactionaries. One should say, "With the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people instead suffered..."

    (10) With what indignant voices did the representatives accuse the defendants of their crimes! (Periodical)
    (11) People still remember what a great role the advanced deeds of the Yang Qingyun group played in promoting the development of the movement! (Periodical)

    The problem with these two sentences is that they mix narrative and exclamatory sentences, making them neither one nor the other. (10) "What" should be changed to "very," and the word "is" should also be deleted. (11) Delete the word "ah" and the exclamation point at the end of the sentence.

    Foreign Expressions. The trend of grammatical Europeanization is natural, and all opposing forces cannot stop this trend. However, this does not mean that we can arbitrarily imitate foreign languages without any restrictions. In adopting a certain expression from a foreign language, the first question to ask is whether it is necessary. If the native language also has a comparable expression, there is no need to use a foreign expression that ordinary people are not accustomed to. The second question to ask is whether it is possible. Some foreign expressions can be accepted by the rules of our language, while others are incompatible with the rules of our language. If we don't ask about the specifics and mechanically bring them in, it will inevitably destroy the purity of our language. The following are examples of mechanically imitating foreign languages without asking whether it is necessary or possible.

    (12) A new horizon will appear before the British people. (Newspaper)
    (13) After returning to factories and manufacturing plants, veterans became excellent workers and technicians. (Book)
    (14) Some say life is too boring and want to change the environment; others say they can't find a job in England and want to seek a good time in the East. (Periodical)
    (15) These uneasy feelings are shared by large-scale kerosene operators, power stations, railways, shipping companies, and other owners. (Periodical)

    (12) "Horizon" is a hard translation. It should be translated as "prospect." (13) "Factory" and "manufacturing plant" are not distinguished in Chinese. Listing them together is confusing. Just say "factory." (14) "Seek a good time" is difficult to understand. One should say "might as well go to the East to have some fun." (15) "Feelings" cannot be "shared." The two "shared by" should be changed to one "are also shared by...". To avoid the repetition of "owners" and "shared by" in wording, "owners" can be changed to "business owners."

    (16) The result is that the harvest area can be expanded three times, which means that everyone can have 1.2 hectares of food instead of 0.4 hectares. (Periodical)
    (17) We must stand at the forefront of the democratic peace struggle forever. (Manuscript)
    (18) [Pearson and Hober said:] Unless a satisfactory and acceptable alternative is found to reduce the population..., it will be difficult to obtain freedom from war or famine. (Periodical)
    (19) Alexei turned his head to him, with an air of not seeing him. (Book)

    (16) "Instead of" is a foreign expression. In Chinese, one should say, "Everyone's food supply increases from 0.4 hectares to 1.2 hectares."
    (17) One should say, "We must stand at the forefront of... forever." In addition, "the forefront of the democratic peace struggle" should be "the forefront of the struggle for democracy and peace." (18) This sentence is also a word-for-word hard translation. It doesn't match the original text, and it's almost impossible to guess its meaning. One should say, "War and famine are unavoidable." (19) Why not say, "as if he didn't see him"?

    (20) Needless to say, in capitalist countries, the broad masses of people cannot enjoy the benefits of modern medicine. (Newspaper)
    (21) This is capitalism, destroying the soil along with the goods it produces. (Periodical)
    (22) Because Soviet aviation, when he spent a relatively short time outside the army, has come so far. (Book)

    (20) The "needless to say" and "the" can be deleted. (21) Should be changed to "It is capitalism that destroys... goods." (22) "Has come so far" is difficult to understand. One should say, "has made great progress." Also, "when" should be changed to "during"; "relatively short" is awkward, should be changed to "not too long"; "time" cannot be used with "a", "a" should be changed to "a period of".

    (23) If you slip and injure yourself, you can't blame the floor. (Periodical)
    (24) However, it is a fact that Germany can now feed more people than itself. (Periodical)
    (25) But we have to dig out the numbers to see if the earth is really crowded with people, as Malthus would have us believe. (Periodical)

    (23) "Yourself" is redundant and should be deleted. Add "了" after "injure." (24) Should be changed to "In fact, Germany has a surplus of food supply to its own country." (25) The original meaning is "to see if the earth is as crowded as the Malthusian school says."

    Inconsistent with Facts. Whether speaking or writing, conforming to the facts is the most basic condition. If it does not match the facts, even if there are no problems in grammar and rhetoric, it still cannot stand. Although this is not within the scope of rhetoric, there is no other place to insert it, so it is attached here.

    (26) The stove candy that children love to eat during the Spring Festival was invented before its manufacturing method was recorded in ancient books. (Newspaper)
    (27) In the Jiangnan area, due to excessive rain, attention should be paid to drainage work. After the rain, farmers should be mobilized to weed to maintain moisture in the soil and make the soil loose and dry. (Newspaper)
    (28) The reporter excitedly read some rapid reports published by the American People's Revolutionary University in support of the new China's anti-aggression. (Periodical)
    (29) Yi Xing is also an outstanding talent in the history of astronomy. Ouyang Xiu's New Tang History did not even write a biography for him. (Periodical)
    (30) As of July 1948, Minsheng Company had about 130 ships of various sizes (95 steamships), 72,000 tons, including 4 ships, more than 15,000 tons, docked in Hong Kong; 3 ships, 2,121 tons, in the Liberated Areas; and more than 100 ships, 60,000 tons, on the Sichuan River line. (Newspaper)
    (31) The distribution area of tung trees in our country is very wide, from 220 degrees to 330 degrees north latitude, and 100 degrees to 120 degrees east longitude. All places where the winter temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius are suitable for planting three-year tung trees. (Newspaper)

    (26) Since it was invented before there were records, how do we know? Stove candy is not bronze or stone and will not be preserved to this day. If there is concrete evidence, it should be explained. Otherwise, readers will have doubts. (27) According to common sense, grass can maintain moisture. How can weeding still maintain moisture? What is even stranger is that it first says to maintain moisture in the soil, and then says "make the soil loose and dry," which is confusing! (28) Is there a People's Revolutionary University in America? Every reader will probably have such a question. If there is, a note should be added. (29) There is no New Tang History in the Twenty-Four Histories, only the New Book of Tang. (30) The previous statement said that the total tonnage was 72,000 tons, but the sum of the three figures below is more than 77,000 tons, a difference of as much as 5,000 tons! (31) Latitude ranges from the equator to the north and south poles, each only 90 degrees. Where would there be 220 degrees and 330 degrees? Presumably, it is a mistake for 22 degrees and 33 degrees. The author regarded a small circle indicating degrees as a single digit, so the number increased tenfold out of thin air. Secondly, the author said, "All places where the winter temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius are suitable for planting three-year tung trees." However, the following lists tung-producing areas such as Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, etc. The winter temperature in these areas, even in the southernmost Yunnan Province, is only about 14 or 15 degrees Celsius. The only place where the winter temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius is the southernmost part of Hainan Island. "20 degrees" is probably also a mistake.

    语法、修辞讲话（第五讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第八段    修辞杂例
    譬喻不伦。用甲事来比拟乙事，甲乙之间必须有类似之点，否则就无法比拟。下面的譬喻都不恰当，让人感到不伦不类。
    （一）江面上再也见不着中国人民耻辱的脚印——那些挂着别个国家旗帜的军舰。（期）
    （二）后浪推前浪，从一个组，到一个车间，到整个的厂。（期）
    （三）鸭绿江，它将中朝两国人民的传统友谊密切的巩固犹如江水永流不息！（期）
    （四）我要将鲜红的生命，不留一滴空白的交给一九五一年。（报）
    （五）它们还利用联合国作防空洞，作为掩护进攻人民，进攻和平的碉堡。（期）
    （六）她号召同志们要以自己的行动在“伟大”的两个字中争取做一笔一划中的一点。（稿）
    （七）尤其近十余年来凯恩斯学说的广泛流传，在有关就业、消费、投资、利息等章目中作了许多类似文字的游戏。（期）
    （一）江面上决不会有脚印，把军舰比做脚印也不恰当。（二）后浪推前浪是递进，从一个组到一个车间，再到整个的厂，是范围的扩大，不能相比。（三）江水永流不息只能表示时间的久远，跟“巩固”与否无关。（四）“生命不留空白”费解。生命也不会有颜色，“鲜红的生命”不知是什么意思。此外，空白不是液体，不能论滴，应说“一块空白”。（五）防空洞是避难的地方，碉堡是防御的据点，两个譬喻的意味不一致。应该把“作防空洞”连同后面的逗号删去。（六）“一笔一画中的一点”费解，“以自己的行动”也不必要。改为“她号召同志们要争取做‘伟大’两个字的一笔一画”，稍好，但仍怪异。（七）文字并不是游戏，怎么能说“类似文字的游戏”？作者的意思是说“做了许多文字游戏”。
    语气错误。
    （八）在美日反动派高压之下，日本和平签名人数多达六百余万，就是一个明证。（期）
    （九）随着抗战的胜利，中国人民更遭受到了空前未有的苦难。（报）（八）从语气上看，似乎签名者之多是由于反动派的高压，这自然不是事实。改做“虽然在美日反动派……签名的人还有六百余万之多……”，语气才合式。（九）既然胜利了，不应再有苦难。中国人民所以遭受苦难，并非由于抗战胜利，而是由于反动派的胡作非为，应说“抗战胜利了，中国人民反而遭受……”。
    （十）代表们都是以何等激愤的声音指控被告们的罪恶！（期）
    （十一）人们都还记得杨清云小组的先进事迹在运动的开展上曾经起了多么大的推动作用啊！（期）这两句的毛病是把叙述句和感叹句混和起来，变得四不像。（十）“何等”应改为“十分”，“是”字也应删去。（十一）删去“啊”字和句末的惊叹号。
    外国说法。语法欧化的趋势是很自然的，一切反对的力量都遏止不住这个潮流，但这并不是说我们可以任意模仿外国语言，毫无限制。采取外国语言的某种表达方式，第一要问有没有必要，如果本土的语言也有相当的说法，就不必去搬弄一般人不习惯的洋说法。第二要问有没有可能，有些外国表达方式是我们的语言规律所能接受的，有些是和我们的语言规律不相容的，如果不问三七二十一，硬搬进来，必然破坏我们的语言的纯洁。下面所举都是不问必要不必要，可能不可能，生吞活剥地模仿外国语言的例子。
    （十二）新的天际将在英国人民面前出现。（报）
    （十三）退伍军人回到工厂和制造厂以后就成为优秀的工人和技师。（书）
    （十四）有的说生活太厌倦了，想换一下环境；还有的说在英国找不到职业，到东方去寻求一段好时光。（期）
    （十五）这些不安的心理分给着大规模煤油经营者，分给着电力站、铁路、船公司等等的所有者。（期）（十二）“天际”是硬译的，应译“远景”。（十三）“工厂”和“制造厂”在中国话里没有分别，并举出来，徒乱人意，只说“工厂”就行了。（十四）“寻求一段好时光”费解，应说“不如到东方去玩一下”。（十五）“心理”不能“分给”，应把两个“分给着”改做一个“也为……所共有”。为了避免“所有者”与“所共有”在字面上重复，可以把“所有者”改为“企业主”。
    （十六）归结是收成区域可以扩充到三倍，就是说每个人可以有一·二公顷的给养来代替○·四公顷。（期）
    （十七）要站在民主和平斗争的最前线一直到永远。（稿）
    （十八）〔披尔逊和赫勃说：〕除非找出一个满意而可以接受的代替方式来缩减人口……，终难从战争或饥荒方面获得自由的。（期）
    （十九）阿历克赛把头转向他那边，带着好像并没看见他的神气。（书）（十六）“代替”是外国说法。中国话应说“每个人从○·四公顷的给养增加为一·二公顷的给养”。
    （十七）应说“要永远站在……的最前线”。此外，“民主和平斗争的最前线”应该是“争取民主和和平的斗争的最前线”。（十八）这句话也是逐字硬译出来的，不对原文，简直无法猜出它的意思。应该说“战争和饥荒是无法避免的”。（十九）何不说“好像并没有看见他似的”？
    （二十）那是不消说的，在资本主义国家内，广大的人民是享受不到现代医学福利的。（报）
    （二一）这就是资本主义，消灭了土壤连同它所生产的物品。（期）
    （二二）因为苏联航空，当他在军队外面度过的一个比较地并不算长的时间，已经走得多么远了。（书）
    （二十）的“那是”和“的”大可删去。（二一）应改为“消灭了……物品的是资本主义”。（二二）“已经走了多么远了”费解，应说“已经有了很大的进步了”。又，“当”应改为“在”；“比较地并不算长”生硬，应改为“不算太长”；“时间”不能论“个”，“一个”应改为“一段”。
    （二三）如果你滑了一交跌伤你自己，那是不能怪地板的。（期）
    （二四）然而这是一个事实，在今天，德国已能给养比自己更多的人民了。（期）
    （二五）可是我们得翻出数字来，看一看地球上是不是确已挤满了人，像马尔萨斯所说的会使我们相信。（期）（二三）“你自己”多余，应删去，“跌伤”后加“了”字。（二四）应改为“事实上德国粮食供给本国已有剩余”。（二五）原文的意思是“看一看地球上是不是像马尔萨斯学派的人所说的那样拥挤”。
    不合事实。不论说话或作文，符合事实是最起码的条件，如果与事实不符，尽管语法和修辞上都没有毛病，也仍然站不住。这虽然不属修辞的范围，但没有别的地方可以安插，就附在这里讲一讲。
    （二六）春节中孩子们顶喜欢吃的灶糖，它的制造方法在古书有记载以前就已经发明。（报）
    （二七）江南地区因雨水过多，要注意排水工作，雨后要发动农民锄草，以保持土中水分，使土质疏松干燥。（报）
    （二八）记者兴奋地看了美国人民革命大学所刊行的一些支援新中国反侵略的快报。（期）
    （二九）一行在天文史上亦是一位杰出的人才。欧阳修新唐史竟不为之立传。（期）
    （三○）截至一九四八年七月，民生公司约有大小船只一百三十多艘（轮船计九十五艘），七万二千吨，计泊香港的四艘、一万五千多吨，在解放区的三艘、二千一百二十一吨，在川江线的一百多艘、六万多吨。（报）
    （三一）我国油桐分布区域甚广，自北纬二百二十度至三百三十度，东经一百度至一百二十度之间，凡冬季温度在摄氏二十度以上的地方，均宜种植三年桐。（报）（二六）既然在有记载以前就发明了，我们怎么知道的呢？灶糖不是金石，决不会保存到现在。如果确有证据，就应加以说明，不然读者是会发生疑问的。（二七）根据常识，草可以保持水分。锄了草，怎么还能保持水分？更奇怪的是前面刚说要保持土中水分，接着又说“使土质疏松干燥”，好不令人胡涂！（二八）美国是不是有一所人民革命大学？恐怕每个读者都会发生这样的疑问。如果确实有，应该加个注子。（二九）二十四史里没有新唐史，只有新唐书。（三○）前面说总吨数是七万二千吨，但后面三项数字之和却是七万七千余吨，相差竟达五千吨之多！（三一）纬度从赤道到南北极。各只九十度，哪里会有二百二十度和三百三十度？猜想起来恐怕是二十二度和三十三度之误，作者把表示度数的一个小圈当做一位数字，于是数目凭空大了十倍。其次，作者说“凡冬季温度在摄氏二十度以上的地方，均宜种植三年桐”。但下文列举产桐地区有四川、湖南、浙江、湖北、云南、贵州等省，这些地区的冬季温度，以最南的云南省说，也只有十四五度左右，冬季温度在摄氏二十度以上的只有海南岛的极南部，“二十度”恐怕也有错误。（本讲完，全文未完）
