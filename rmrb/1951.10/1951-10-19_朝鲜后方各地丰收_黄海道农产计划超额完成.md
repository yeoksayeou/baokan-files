Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th: The rural areas in the rear of Korea, engaged in arduous struggle, have largely achieved good harvests this year. Farmers in Hwanghae Province, under the leadership of the Labor Party and the People's Committee, overcame difficulties such as a lack of labor, livestock, seeds, and fertilizer. Farmers in some areas launched struggles to increase production by planting autumn wheat and weeding and harvesting on schedule amidst the smoke of artillery fire and bombs. They have now achieved a victory of good harvest. Song Bong-uk, Chairman of the Hwanghae Province People's Committee, Kim Yeol, Chairman of the Hwanghae Province Party Department of the Labor Party, and Li Ke-seok, Plenipotentiary Representative of the Cabinet stationed in Hwanghae Province, jointly wrote to Premier Kim Il-sung on the 15th to report on the good harvest. The report stated that as of October 14, Hwanghae Province had overfulfilled the agricultural production plan by 101.6 percent. The autumn wheat sown area reached more than 100,000 "chongbo" (approximately 1 hectare per "chongbo"), an increase of 62,600 "chongbo" compared with the same period last year. In their report, they also guaranteed to carry out the autumn harvest on schedule and to achieve greater victories in the collection of in-kind taxes on late-season crops and winter preparations.

    朝鲜后方各地丰收
    黄海道农产计划超额完成
    【新华社平壤十七日电】艰苦斗争中的朝鲜后方各地农村，今年大部丰收。黄海道各地农民，在劳动党和人民委员会的领导下，克服了缺少劳动力、畜力以及种籽肥料的困难。有些地区的农民，在炮火炸弹硝烟弥漫的环境中按期展开播种秋麦和锄草收割等增产斗争，目前他们都已取得了丰收的胜利。黄海道人民委员会委员长宋凤郁、劳动党黄海道党部委员长金烈和内阁特派驻黄海道全权代表李客锡，十五日联名上书金日成首相，报告丰收的情况。报告中说：截至十月十四日，黄海道已以百分之一百零一点六超额完成了农产计划。秋麦播种面积达十万町步（按一町步约合一公顷）以上，较去年同期多种了六万二千六百町步。他们在报告书中并保证要按期进行秋收工作，并要在征收晚期作物现物税和过冬准备工作中取得更大的胜利。
