Final Victory Will Surely Belong to Us
Zhang Qunsheng, Special-Class Merit Citation Recipient, a Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

A year ago today, the invading devil of American imperialism, the murderous ringleader MacArthur, commanded the invading beasts to approach our border—the Yalu River, and arrogantly declared that "the Sino-Korean border is not the Yalu River." He wanted to turn our beautiful cities and villages of New China into the same state as Korea, wanting our Chinese people to suffer the same pain as the Korean people. Humph! American devils, you are wrong. The Chinese people who have stood up are not to be trifled with.

Now, American imperialism knows the power of the Chinese people. Although we do not have many airplanes and tanks, we still drove them from the Yalu River across the 38th Parallel. How many of those so-called "ace troops" of the American army, the 1st Marine Division, the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Division… have been killed by us, and how many have become our prisoners. More than a thousand enemy planes have been shot down by us, and the pilots have also become our prisoners. Enemy cars, tanks, artillery, and new automatic weapons have been captured and used to equip ourselves.

The facts of the past year have proven that the indomitable spirit of our army is the guarantee of defeating the enemy. Take our company as an example. On October 27th of last year, our company seized Huangcaoling. There was a main peak below called Yantaifeng, which was defended by a company of the enemy. Our company used a platoon's strength and took Yantaifeng in one morning.

Then we used two squads to defend the main peak, and fought the enemy, who outnumbered us several times over, for a whole day. On the second day, only five or six people were left in our two squads. Some comrades were wounded and went down. The enemy initially occupied half of the main peak. The enemy's strength increased to nearly a battalion, and they launched continuous attacks. The company commander had just returned from the regiment and, upon hearing this news, immediately asked me to go with him to the main peak position. I thought: Although I am a bugler, this time I must go to the squad to defend the position. I am a Communist Party member, and in such an emergency, a Communist Party member cannot retreat. I didn't have a gun, so I asked the clerk for a Mauser rifle and took four boxes of ammunition. At the same time, I asked the three messengers from our company headquarters to go with the company commander, and also asked the barber to find a gun and join the battle. We ran forward closely behind the company commander. The enemy was blocking our way forward, but none of us cared about that. When we ran halfway up the mountain, I felt as if someone had pulled my right arm. The company commander saw that the cotton from our cotton-padded sleeves had been blown out by bullets, and quickly asked me: "Bugler, are you hit?" I looked at it, and my arm was not bleeding, so I continued to run upwards. As soon as we went up, the enemy launched an attack. I looked at the terrain and deployed the three messengers, telling Li Huating to block the enemy's advance from the side on the left slope. We counterattacked the enemy from the front. The enemy charged, and more than twenty of them came up. Seeing that the enemy was fierce, I stood up, held the Mauser rifle, and swept it fiercely at the enemy. One enemy after another fell. I said to the machine gun shooter Guo Zhongquan next to me, "I will cooperate with your machine gun, and we will knock down anyone who comes up, and resolutely hold the position." Guo Zhongquan said, "Right! No matter how many enemies come, we cannot let them occupy our position." Our volley of guns and grenades drove the enemy back down.

At this moment, the company commander reported to us the victory on the western front. He said: "The brotherly units on the western front fought very well and annihilated the enemy. This victory is inseparable from the victory of our blocking battle." The company commander also called on everyone: "Fight well, strive for greater victory, strive to win the first-class merit award, and become the number one hero to go abroad."

Everyone's morale was extremely high, and we repelled two enemy charges in a row.

My grenades were used up, so I collected the surrounding stones and prepared to use them to fight when the enemy charged again. I said to everyone: "As long as we are calm and brave, it will be in vain no matter how many enemies come. This is a good opportunity for everyone to strive for merit and join the Party! Guo Zhongquan, you have made a great contribution in the past, and this time you must strive to add merit on top of merit!" He said: "Right! Resolutely hold the position and strive for new merits." As he spoke, the third squad came up from the bottom of the mountain. The company commander asked the third squad to send half a squad to charge the enemy from the left and seize that half of the position. I said to the company commander: "There are less than twenty of us altogether. It is a bit early to attack at this time. Even if we take down that half of the position, it will be difficult to defend. It is better to defend here for the time being. There are still enemies on the mountain, and the enemy's artillery does not dare to fire at the mountain, because it is afraid of hitting its own troops. In this way, we can preserve ourselves and kill more enemies. We will hold on until night, and the enemy will be scared. Then we will launch an attack, and then the entire position will be ours." The company commander considered it and said, "That's right!" Just as he had deployed the third squad, the enemy launched a third charge, and more than thirty enemies came up. Our volley of guns knocked down half of the enemy, and another volley of grenades and stones drove the enemy back.

I saw very clearly that when I threw the stones and hit the enemy, the enemy shouted and ran back. I said to everyone: "We must conserve ammunition. Stones can also be used as grenades. Everyone, quickly prepare stones. The enemy is nothing great. Everyone, fight well, win glory for our motherland, avenge our sacrificed comrades, and resolutely hold the position."

The enemy set up light and heavy machine guns on a large rock, firing down at us from a high position, posing a great threat to us. I saw a small tree shaking wildly behind the rock, and I thought, there must be many enemies there. I told the deputy squad leader of the third squad to throw a grenade there. He threw it accurately, right under the small tree. The explosion made the enemy scream. Then the enemy launched a fourth charge. None of us had grenades anymore. Everyone fired a volley of guns and then threw a burst of stones, driving the more than thirty enemies back in disarray.

It was getting dark, and the enemy launched a fifth charge. I was aiming at the charging enemies, knocking them down one by one, when suddenly the messenger Xiao Wu exclaimed in surprise: "The company commander is hit!" I crawled over and saw that the company commander's right face was covered in blood, and he didn't make a sound. I touched it with my hand, and there was a hole the size of a grenade on his face. The company commander gloriously sacrificed himself! Xiao Wu and the others cried, and the barber was also stunned. I thought: "The political instructor once said: Communists don't shed tears easily." I said to Xiao Wu and the others: "We must not cry. Crying is useless. We can only fight resolutely, annihilate more enemies, and avenge the company commander!" Then I shouted loudly: "Comrades, avenge the company commander!" Following that, everyone shouted in unison: "We will resolutely hold the position, annihilate the enemy, and avenge the company commander!" They wiped away their tears and kept fighting back the enemy.

After dark, the political instructor redeployed the forces, and the entire position was retaken, annihilating more than a hundred enemies.

This is what I personally experienced. I feel that our year abroad has been one of victory after victory. When we first went abroad, we didn't know the enemy's bottom line, but now we have learned how to annihilate the enemy more effectively, and we have gained rich combat experience in actual combat. At that time, we only had "Type 38" rifles, and we also defeated the enemy who was armed to the teeth, driving them from the Yalu River all the way south of the 38th Parallel. Now our troops have modern equipment, we also have powerful artillery, and we also have anti-aircraft weapons. The enemy's planes dare not be as crazy as they were before the Fourth Battle. This is the result of the warm support of the people of the motherland to the front line. The people of the motherland have truly done what the front line lacks, they will support it. Recently, I heard that the people of the motherland have donated more than 2,400 airplanes. These are precisely the guarantees for us to move from victory to victory. We have the determination and confidence to strive for final victory. We also believe that final victory will surely belong to us.

    最后胜利一定属于我们
    中国人民志愿军某部特等功臣  张群生
    去年的今天，美帝国主义的侵略魔鬼、杀人头子麦克阿瑟，指挥侵略野兽们逼近我国边境——鸭绿江，并狂妄地宣布“中朝边境不是鸭绿江”，他想把我们新中国的美丽的城市和乡村，也要变成朝鲜那样，想叫我们中国人民也同样遭受朝鲜人民那样的痛苦。哼！美国鬼子，你想错了，站起来了的中国人民不是好惹的。
    现在，美帝国主义知道中国人民的厉害了。我们的飞机、坦克虽然不多，可是也把他们从鸭绿江打过了三八线，那些美国的所谓“王牌军”陆战第一师、骑一师、二十四师………有多少人被我们打死啦，有多少又当了我们的俘虏。敌人的飞机，也被我们打落了一千多架，驾驶员也做了我们的俘虏。敌人的汽车、坦克、大炮，新式的自动武器，被我们缴了过来装备了自己。
    一年来的事实证明，我们军队顽强不屈的精神，就是打败敌人的保证。就拿我们连来说吧，去年十月二十七日，我们连抢上了黄草岭，下边的一个主峰叫烟台峰，敌人一个连的兵力在那里守着。我们连用一个排的兵力，一个上午就把烟台峰攻下来啦。
    然后我们用两个班坚守主峰，和比我们多好几倍的敌人打了一整天。第二天，我们的两个班只剩下五六个人，有些同志负伤下去了，敌人一开始竟把这个主峰占了一半。敌人的兵力增加到将近一个营，不断地发起进攻。连长刚从团里回来，听到了这个消息，马上就叫我跟他到主峰阵地上去。我想：我虽然是一个司号员，这回我非到班里坚守阵地不可。我是一个共产党员，在这样紧急的情况下，共产党员是不能退后的。我没有枪，我向文书要了一支马链式，带上了四匣子弹。同时，我叫我们连部的三个通讯员，都跟连长去，又叫理发员找了一支枪也去参加战斗。我们紧跟着连长向前奔跑。敌人在封锁我们前进的道路，我们谁也不管这些。跑到半山，我觉得右胳膊像谁拉了一把似的，连长看见我们棉衣袖子的棉花被子弹打了出来，连忙问我：“司号员，你挂彩了吗？”我看了一下，胳膊没有出血，又继续地往上跑。我们刚上去，敌人就发起了冲锋。我看了一下地形，就把三个通讯员都布置开了，叫李华亭在左边坡上，由侧面封锁敌人的前进，我们在正面反击敌人。敌人冲锋了，上来了二十多个，我看敌人来得很凶，站起来抱着马链式向敌人猛扫。敌人一个一个倒下去了。我对旁边的机枪射手郭忠全说：“我配合你的机枪，敌人上来一个打倒一个，坚决守住阵地。”郭忠全说：“对！敌人来多少也不能让它占了我们的阵地。”我们一排枪、一排手榴弹，把敌人打下去了。
    这时候，连长向我们报告了西线的胜利消息。他说：“西线兄弟部队打得很好，歼灭了敌人，这个胜利是和我们的阻击战的胜利分不开的。”连长并号召大家：“好好打，争取更大的胜利，争取立出国第一功，当出国第一名英雄。”
    大家的情绪高涨极了，我们连续打退了敌人的两次冲锋。
    我的手榴弹打完了，我把周围的石头都搜集在一起，准备敌人再冲锋的时候就用石头打。我对大家说：“咱们只要沉着勇敢，敌人来多少也是白费，这是大家争取立功入党的好机会呀！郭忠全，你过去立过一大功，这回要争取功上加功！”他说：“对！坚决守住阵地，争取立新功。”说着，三班从山下边上来啦，连长叫三班抽出半个班从左边向敌人冲锋，夺取那半面阵地。我对连长说：“我们共合不到二十几个人，这时就进攻还早一点，就是攻下那半面阵地，也很难守。不如暂时在这里坚守。现在山上还有敌人，敌人的炮也不敢往山上打，因为它怕打了它自己的部队。这样，我们就能保存自己，多杀伤敌人。我们坚守到晚上，敌人就熊啦。我们再发起冲锋，那时候整个阵地都是我们的了。”连长考虑了一下，就说：“这样对！”他把三班刚布置好，敌人又发起了第三次冲锋，上来了三十多个敌人。我们一排枪把敌人打倒了一半，又一排手榴弹加石头，把敌人都打回去了。
    我看得很清楚，我把石头扔出去打在敌人的身上，敌人就喊叫着往回跑。我对大家说：“要节省弹药，石头也能当手榴弹用，大家赶紧准备石头，敌人没有什么了不起的。大家好好打，给咱们祖国人民争光，给咱们牺牲的同志报仇，坚决守住阵地。”
    敌人把轻重机枪架在一块大石头上，居高临下往我们这边打枪，给我们的威胁很大。我看到石头后边一棵小树乱晃，心想，一定那里有很多敌人。我告诉三班副班长往那里扔个手榴弹，他扔得很准，正落在小树下面。打得敌人哇啦哇啦直叫。接着敌人又开始第四次冲锋。我们谁也没有手榴弹了，大家打了一排枪，又猛打了一阵石头，把三十多个敌人打得连滚带爬跑回去了。
    天快黑了，敌人又发起第五次冲锋。我正在瞄准冲锋的敌人一个一个地把它们打倒，忽然通讯员小吴惊讶地喊：“连长挂彩啦！”我爬过去一看：连长右边脸上流满了血，一声也不响。我用手一摸，脸上有手榴弹大一个窟窿。连长光荣地牺牲了！小吴他们哭，理发员也呆啦。我想：“过去指导员说过：共产党员是轻易不流泪的。”我对小吴他们说：“我们不要哭，哭没有用，我们只有坚决地打，多歼灭敌人，给连长报仇！”接着我又大声地喊：“同志们，给连长报仇呵！”随着，大家一致地喊：“我们坚决守住阵地，歼灭敌人给连长报仇！”他们擦干了眼泪，一直把敌人打了回去。
    天黑以后，教导员重新布置了兵力，把整个阵地夺回来了，歼灭敌人一百多个。
    这是我亲身经历过的事情。我感觉我们出国一年来是从胜利走向胜利的：我们刚出国的时候，不摸敌人的底，而现在我们学会了怎样更多地歼灭敌人，在实战中取得了丰富的战斗经验。那时候我们只有“三八式”步枪，也战胜了武装到牙齿的敌人，从鸭绿江边一直把敌人打过三八线以南，而现在我们的部队有了近代化的装备，我们也有了强大的炮兵，也有高射武器，敌人的飞机也不敢像四次战役以前那样疯狂了。这都是祖国人民热烈支援前线的结果，祖国人民真做到了前线缺什么就支援什么。最近听说祖国人民光捐献飞机就是二千四百多架。这些正是我们从胜利走向胜利的保证，我们有决心有信心争取最后的胜利。我们也相信，最后的胜利一定属于我们。
