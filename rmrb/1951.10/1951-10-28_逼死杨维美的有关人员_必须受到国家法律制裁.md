    Those responsible for forcing Yang Weimei to her death must be punished by national law

    To the Editor:
    After reading the news in the People's Daily on September 30th about the suicide of Yixing woman Yang Weimei due to a marriage dispute, I felt extremely angry. The Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, have been liberated. However, even as we celebrate our victory with joy and excitement today, there are still a few of our women compatriots suffering from feudal oppression, even being forced to commit suicide. How jarring this is! I completely agree with the opinion put forward in the People's Daily's "Brief Review of Political and Legal Work" on September 30th. The Yixing County People's Court must retry this case and severely punish those responsible for violating national laws and discipline and infringing upon human rights.

    逼死杨维美的有关人员
    必须受到国家法律制裁编辑同志：
    读了人民日报九月三十日所载宜兴妇女杨维美因婚姻纠纷被迫自杀的消息后，我感到极端愤怒。中国人民在毛主席、共产党领导下，已经得到了解放，可是，在我们欢腾鼓舞庆祝胜利的今天，居然仍有少数妇女同胞，受着封建压迫，甚至被迫自杀，这是多么刺耳的事啊！我完全同意人民日报九月三十日“政法工作简评”中所提出的意见，宜兴县人民法院必须重审这个案子，并严惩违反国家法纪、侵犯人权的有关人员。
