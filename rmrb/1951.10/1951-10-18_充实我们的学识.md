    Enrich Our Knowledge

    To commemorate our great teacher Lu Xun, I feel it necessary for us to examine ourselves. Otherwise, commemoration easily becomes a mere formality, and great figures become idols, which does little good for us.

    Lu Xun was a man of extensive learning. What about us? A simple "shame" doesn't solve our problem. In my view, there's a rather obvious trend in today's literary and artistic work: specialization is effective, but interconnectedness is lacking. Because the People's Government values literary and artistic work, and because the people need art, literary and artistic workers across the country have all become busy. Those involved in opera reform are reforming opera, those writing ballads are writing ballads, and those working on drama, opera, and film are also sticking to their posts, working enthusiastically, and achieving some rather good results. This is an exciting and good phenomenon. However, because everyone is constantly striving for their tasks and studying their fields in depth, they inevitably focus their minds on one thing, and their horizons unconsciously narrow a lot. For example, some involved in opera reform focus solely on finding innovative methods in the form and techniques of certain folk dramas, never talking about drama or opera again; or someone who originally worked on drama doesn't understand folk drama very well, but once they participate in opera reform, they painstakingly try to teach Peking opera or local opera performance methods to follow the path of drama, forgetting the inherent advantages of Peking opera or local opera. Another example: some who are accustomed to folk art forms delve deeply into the forms of those arts, never looking at new poetry or anything else again; while some who are enthusiastically creating new poetry may not bother to look at folk art forms. In this way, although everyone is not forming factions or arguing, the progress of literary and artistic work is unintentionally hindered, and human, financial, and time resources are inevitably wasted.

    I know that some experts who are deeply involved in ancient literature or ancient art often use the excuse of preserving traditional artistic techniques to ignore the construction theories of new art and are unwilling to learn new techniques. Similarly, some who are engaged in new literature or new art may also not care about our inherent literary and artistic traditions. Such a lack of communication causes the movement of discarding the old to bring forth the new to suffer losses.

    Lu Xun's erudition contributed to his greatness. His knowledge of ancient Chinese scholarship, placed in another person, might well have made him a conservative scholar. However, he was both knowledgeable about the past and aware of the present; he knew both Eastern literature and paid attention to Western literature; he both created and enthusiastically translated. His knowledge gave him the most accurate balance in his heart, fairly and correctly weighing everything; prejudice could not become his weight!

    In learning from Lu Xun, in addition to intensifying our ideological study, we must also learn more skills. Don't let prejudice prevent us from touching ancient or modern literature and art. The richer our knowledge, the wider our minds will be, and the less prejudice there will be. "Knowing only one thing and not knowing the other" is the embryo of prejudice.

    For myself, I don't understand music. This has caused me to suffer losses. When I write a ballad or a song, I can only mobilize words from an ideological and emotional perspective, and I don't know what their musical effect will be; and the people I encounter who create the scores may not be able to distinguish tones and have little literary cultivation, so writing lyrics and creating scores takes a lot of time and effort, and the result is still many "inverted characters" that are unpleasant to sing. Similarly, because I don't understand the techniques of film scripts, I can only write a story and let people who understand film adapt it into a film script. Of course, this kind of cooperation is not a bad thing in itself; however, going through two hands does waste time and manpower. Moreover, if the person who adapts the film script for me happens to have no literary cultivation, he may make a vivid story lifeless, all the techniques are correct, but there is no artistic flavor. Ugh, two hands wasted! I earnestly hope to learn a little music and a little film script writing. I also hope that people who can create scores will study the precise scoring rules of Kunqu opera, and that people who can write film scripts will learn more other artistic skills. Enriching our knowledge is beneficial to ourselves and to our careers. Conversely, if we each cling to one corner and don't ask about other things, literary and artistic work will inevitably suffer greatly, and human and financial resources will inevitably be wasted. Although this matter uses my personal example, this piecemeal, slow-moving phenomenon is probably widespread. This is worth reflecting on. To improve literature and art, we must first improve the knowledge and skills of literary and artistic workers.

    We must never casually consider ourselves experts. That would make us complacent and shut ourselves off. We cannot become omniscient, but we must strive to know and understand more. None of our current work is being prepared for a utopia. We cannot be isolated because of specialization. For example, if we are complacent about writing some ballads and call ourselves experts, we will isolate ourselves. As a result, we are just adding some new passages to the old ballads in a clumsy imitation, which has little to do with the overall progress of literature and art. Over time, we will fall behind in the literary and artistic army. Conversely, if we also care about the development of new poetry and new music, and link new poetry and new music with ballads, we will have newer experiments and create things with completely new content and forms. In this way, we will not just be attendants of ballads, but their creators. At the same time, if a new poet is unwilling to learn the use of language, the musicality of vocabulary and syntax, etc., from folk art forms, and simply waits for the day when ballads will become a certain school of new poetry, then new poetry will temporarily retire, or perhaps never approach the masses. Our work today is not to preserve yesterday's achievements, but to strive for new victories tomorrow. We cannot look at problems in isolation, because almost no literary and artistic problem is isolated. Our direction is one, which has been indicated to us by Chairman Mao. We must enrich ourselves, know and understand more, so that we can quickly, without going around too many bends, walk on the road pointed out to us by Chairman Mao. Before liberation, we could hold on to a skill, use it when needed, and hide it when not. Today, the people and the People's Government have given us great encouragement and expectations, so we must use more knowledge to enrich ourselves, so as to create works that are sufficient to serve the people, and we can no longer use that skill to take a defensive stance. We must equip ourselves with new weapons. The more society needs us, the more we must improve our abilities, right?

    We admire Lu Xun's erudition, good, let's learn from him, and turn ourselves into talents who are proficient in everything, so that we can take on more and heavier literary and artistic tasks; I am willing to encourage literary and artistic friends together!

### 充实我们的学识

专栏：

    充实我们的学识
    为纪念我们的伟大导师鲁迅先生，我觉得我们有省查我们自己的必要，否则纪念容易成为形式，伟人成为偶像，对我们并无多少好处。
    鲁迅先生是博学的人。我们怎样？这一声“惭愧”，解决不了我们的问题。据我看，今天的文艺工作有一个相当明显的趋势，即分工已见效，而贯通不足。因为人民政府重视文艺工作，因为人民需要文艺，全国的文艺工作者就都忙起来，搞戏曲改革的搞戏曲改革，编鼓词的编鼓词，搞话剧的歌剧的电影的也都各守岗位，热心的工作，而且都有一些相当好的成绩。这是个令人兴奋的好现象。可是，因为大家对任务的时常努力，和对业务的深入学习，就难免把心思专放在某一件事上，眼界也不知不觉的缩小了好多。比如说：有的搞戏曲改革的就专从某种民间戏剧的形式上技巧上想革新的办法，闭口不再谈话剧歌剧；或者本来是演话剧的，并不很懂民间的戏剧，一旦参加了戏曲改革工作，就苦心的下工夫，一定要教京戏或地方戏的演法照着话剧的道儿走，而忘了京剧或地方戏固有的好处。又好比：某些搞惯了民间曲艺的，就深深的钻入曲艺的形式中，连新诗什么的再也不看一眼；而个别的热心创作新诗的呢，也许就不去看看民间曲艺。这样，虽然大家并没有分宗派闹意见，可是对文艺工作的进展就无意中不能不有所阻碍，在人力财力和时间上不能不有所浪费。
    我知道，某些精研古代文学或古代美术的专家，往往借口保存传统的艺术技巧，而忽视了新艺术的建设理论，也不肯学习新的技巧。同样的，某些从事新文学或新美术的或者也不关心我们固有的文学美术的传统。这样的两不碰头，就教推陈出新的运动受到损失。
    鲁迅先生的渊博，助成了他的伟大。他的对中国古代学术的知识，放在另一个人身上，也许适足以教他成为一个有保守性的学者。可是，他既博古，又通今；既知东方的文学，又注意西方的；既创造，又热心翻译。他的学识使他心中有了一架最准确的天平，公平正确的秤量了一切；成见不能成为他的砝码！
    学习鲁迅，我们除了应在更加紧学习思想之外，还要多多的学本领。别教成见阻止了我们去接触古代的或现代的文学艺术。学识越丰富，我们的心里才越宽绰，成见才会越减少。“只知其一，不知其二”是成见的胚胎。
    以我自己来说，我不懂音乐。这就教我吃了亏。在我写一篇鼓词或一首歌子的时候，我只能从思想上感情上调动文字，而不知道它们的音乐效果如何；而我所遇到的制谱的人呢，也许恰好不辨平仄，没有多少文学修养，于是作词制谱费了许多时间力气，结果还是“倒字”不少，唱起来难听。同样的，因为我不懂电影剧本的技巧，所以我只能写个故事，由懂电影的人去改编为电影剧本。自然，这种合作原不是坏事；可是，费两道手到底多费了时间与人力。况且，假若给我改编电影剧本的人恰好没有什么文字与文学的修养，他就可能把个生动的故事弄得毫无生气，技巧都对，而没有艺术的味道。哼，白费了两道手！我切盼能去学一点音乐，学一点电影剧本写法。我也希望会制谱的人，去研究研究昆曲的精密制谱法则，会写电影剧本的人多学点别的文艺本领。丰富我们的知识，对自己对事业全有好处。反之，各自死抱一角，不问旁的事情，文艺工作就必定吃很大的亏，人力财力都不免浪费。这点事虽是以我个人为例，可是这个东拼西凑，慢慢腾腾的现象恐怕是普遍存在的。这值得我们反省。要使文艺提高，须先提高文艺工作者的学识、本领。
    我们切不可随便的自居为专家。那会教我们自满，封锁起来自己。我们不可能成为无所不知的，但是必须争取多知多懂。我们目前的工作没有一件是为了世外桃源预备起来的。我们不能因专工而孤立。举个例说：假若我们为写了一些鼓词而自满，自称专家，我们便孤立起来。结果呢，我们只是给旧鼓词添上了一些照猫画虎的新段子，跟文艺全面的进展就不大发生关系。日久天长，我们就会在文艺大军里掉了队。反之，我们若是也关心新诗与新音乐的发展，而且把新诗、新音乐，与鼓词结系起来，我们便会有更新的试验，创作出内容与形式全新的东西来。这样，我们便不只是鼓词的侍从，而是它的创作者。同时，一个新诗人而不肯向民间曲艺去学习语言的运用，词汇句法中的音乐性等等，而干脆坐待有朝一日鼓词会变成某一派的新诗，那么新诗就会暂时退休，或且永远不会接近民众。我们今天的工作不是保守昨天的成就，而是争取明天的新胜利。我们不能孤立的看问题，因为几乎没有一个文艺问题是孤立着的。我们的方向是一个，已由毛主席给我们指示出来，我们必须充实自己，多知多懂，才能很快的，不多绕湾子的，走向毛主席指给我们的那条大路上去。在解放以前，我们可以抱着一技之长，用之则行，舍之则藏。今天，人民与人民政府都给了我们很大的鼓励与期望，我们就必须用更多的学识丰富自己，从而创造出足够为人民服务的作品来，不能再用那一技之长，专取守势。我们要用新武器装备起自己来。社会上越需要我们，我们不是越得长本事吗？
    我们钦佩鲁迅先生的渊博，好，就跟他学吧，把我们自己也变成个文武昆乱不挡的人才，好担当起更多的更重的文艺任务；愿与文艺界的朋友们共勉之！
