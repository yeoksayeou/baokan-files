    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 13th: According to TASS, the People's Chamber of the Government of the German Democratic Republic held a special session on October 10th to discuss the West German Federal Parliament's statement regarding the People's Chamber's proposal to convene an All-German Conference.
    In its session on September 27th, the West German Federal Parliament avoided giving a direct answer to the People's Chamber's proposal of September 15th to convene an All-German Conference to prepare for all-German elections, thereby unifying Germany and accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Instead, it put forward fourteen proposals as conditions for holding all-German elections, including the condition that international supervision be implemented during the elections.
    The People's Chamber's special session heard a statement made by the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, on behalf of the government. After heated discussions, it unanimously passed a joint telegram from the parliamentary groups of the People's Chamber to the West German Federal Parliament, reiterating the proposal of September 15th and providing a clear response to the Federal Parliament's statement.
    The joint telegram stated: The People's Chamber believes that most of the fourteen conditions put forward by the Federal Parliament regarding the holding of all-German elections are acceptable. However, the People's Chamber requests the Federal Parliament to provide a clear response to two questions in the People's Chamber's proposal of September 15th. These two questions are:
    1. Does the Federal Parliament agree to hold an All-German Conference with the participation of representatives from eastern and western Germany in the near future to discuss issues of vital importance to the German people?
    2. Does the Federal Parliament agree to discuss the following two issues at this All-German Conference: the holding of free all-German elections to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and the acceleration of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany?
    The joint telegram from the parliamentary groups of the People's Chamber was drafted based on Prime Minister Grotewohl's statement. In his statement, Grotewohl pointed out that people from all walks of life in Germany are deeply convinced that Germany must be unified. However, unification is impossible without mutual understanding. Therefore, an All-German Conference must be convened. He pointed out that the Federal Government did not give a direct answer to the People's Chamber's proposal to convene an All-German Conference. Although the People's Chamber put forward a clear agenda for convening an All-German Conference, the Federal Parliament only issued a statement on the issue of holding all-German elections. However, election regulations cannot be decided unilaterally by the Bonn government and the Federal Parliament, but should be formulated through free consultations between both parties. In order to ensure democratic elections throughout Germany, many issues need to be discussed at the All-German Conference, including the Federal Parliament's proposal for international supervision of elections.
    Grotewohl also spoke about the secret negotiations that Adenauer is currently conducting with the High Commissioners of the three Western powers. He pointed out that the purpose of these negotiations is to deepen the division of Germany and drag Germany into the vortex of a third world war. He urged the People's Chamber to ask the Federal Parliament to pay attention to the dangers of these negotiations and to take measures to stop them immediately. He said: Under no circumstances can we allow the Adenauer government to drag the German people into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization behind the backs of the German people and the Federal Parliament, because this would mean disaster for the German people.
    On Grotewohl's recommendation, the People's Chamber also unanimously passed a protest statement drafted by the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Union against Adenauer's negotiations with the High Commissioners of the Western countries, and urged the Bonn Federal Parliament to take a decision to stop these negotiations.

    德意志民主共和国人民议会向波恩议会提出质询
    重申举行全德会议准备全德选举的建议
    并抗议阿登纳将西德拖入北大西洋公约的阴谋
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国政府人民议会于十月十日举行特别会议，讨论了西德联邦议会对于人民议会所提召开全德会议的建议的声明。
    西德联邦议会在九月二十七日的会议上，对于人民议会九月十五日所提出的召开全德会议以准备举行全德选举从而统一德国并加速缔结对德和约问题的建议，避免作正面答复，而提出了十四点建议作为举行全德选举的条件。其中包括在选举时必须实行国际监督的条件。
    人民议会特别会议听取了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥代表政府所发表的声明，经过了热烈的讨论之后，全体一致通过了人民议会各议会党团致西德联邦议会的联名电，向西德联邦议会重申九月十五日的建议。并对联邦议会的声明提出了明确的答复。
    联名电中指出：人民议会认为联邦议会在所提出的关于举行全德选举的十四点条件，大多数是可以接受的，但是，人民议会要求联邦议会对于人民议会九月十五日建议中的两个问题作明确的答复，这两个问题就是：
    一、联邦议会同意在最近的将来举行有德国东部与西部的代表参加的全德会议以讨论对德国人民有切身重要性的问题吗？
    二、联邦议会同意在这个全德会议上讨论下述两个问题，即举行全德自由选举以建立统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的问题以及加速缔结对德和约的问题吗？
    人民议会各议会党团的联名电是根据格罗提渥总理的声明草拟的。格罗提渥在声明中指出：德国各阶层人民都深信：必须统一德国，但是，没有互相间的谅解而要统一是不可能的，为此，必须召开全德会议。他指出：联邦政府对于人民议会关于召开全德会议的建议没有给予直接的答复。虽然人民议会提出了召开全德会议的明确的议程，联邦议会却只就举行全德选举的问题发表了声明。但是，选举条例当然不能由波恩政府和联邦议会擅自决定，而是应该由双方自由协商后制订。为了保证在全德国举行民主的选举，有许多问题需要在全德会议上讨论，也需要讨论联邦议会所提出的国际监督选举的问题。
    格罗提渥并谈到阿登纳目前和西方三国高级专员所正在进行的秘密谈判，他指出：这种谈判的目的在于加深德国的分裂，并把德国卷入第三次世界大战的漩涡。他促请人民议会要求联邦议会注意这种谈判的危险性，并采取措施，马上加以制止。他说：在任何情况下，我们都不能容许阿登纳政府避着德国人民和联邦议会把德国人民拖入北大西洋公约，因为这就意味着德国人民的灾难。
    在格罗提渥的建议下，人民议会也一致通过了由基督教民主联盟议会党团小组所起草的反对阿登纳和西方国家高级专员进行谈判的抗议声明，并敦促波恩联邦议会采取决定以制止这种谈判。
