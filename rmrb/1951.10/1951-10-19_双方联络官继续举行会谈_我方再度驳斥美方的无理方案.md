    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th -- The liaison officers of both sides continued their meeting at 10:00 a.m. on October 18 to discuss the resumption of the delegation meetings. Our liaison officer again refuted the other side's proposal to reduce the scope of the neutral zone to an area with a radius of 3,000 yards around Kaesong and Munsan, and to not impose any regulations on the areas on both sides of the road between Kaesong, Panmunjom, and Munsan. Finally, the other side's liaison officer proposed a plan in which both sides guarantee not to attack the area within a radius of three miles around Kaesong and Munsan, and the Panmunjom-Munsan road itself, but still insisted on not making any regulations for the areas on both sides of the road, and continued to insist on the unreasonable demand that the other side's military aircraft can arbitrarily fly into the neutral zone. Our liaison officer suggested that the other side continue to study our reasonable plan, and the meeting ended at 11:43 a.m. The meeting on October 19 is scheduled to continue at 10:00 a.m.

    双方联络官继续举行会谈
    我方再度驳斥美方的无理方案
    【新华社开城十八日电】十月十八日上午十时，双方联络官继续会议，协商双方代表团复会事宜。我方联络官再度驳斥对方所提出的缩小中立区范围至开城、汶山周围半径三千码的地区，并对开城、板门店、汶山间通路两侧的地区，不加任何规定的方案。最后对方联络官提出了双方保证不攻击开城、汶山周围半径三英里的地区，及板门店、汶山通道本身的方案，但对于通道两侧的地区，则仍然坚持不作任何规定，并继续坚持对方军用飞机可以任意飞入中立区上空的无理要求。我方联络官建议对方继续研究我方的合理方案后，会议在十一时四十三分结束。十月十九日的会议订于上午十时继续举行。
