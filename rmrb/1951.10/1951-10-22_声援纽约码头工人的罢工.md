    Supporting the Strike of New York Dockworkers
    According to incomplete news revealed by the American and British bourgeois news agencies, over a thousand dockworkers at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in New York held a strike beginning on the 15th. By the 17th, the strike had spread to more than twenty docks, and the number of strikers had increased to over two thousand. As a result of the strike, at least twenty-four ships were stranded on the waters of Brooklyn and other places, dealing a powerful blow to the military transport of American imperialism's aggression in Korea and elsewhere. This strike action by the Brooklyn dockworkers is in line with the common interests of the American people and the people of the world, and therefore they are receiving sympathy and concern from the people of the world.
    The sinister plans of American monopoly capitalists to launch a new war must be attacked from all sides in order to effectively defend peace, so that the American people can avoid making unnecessary sacrifices in the reactionary and evil war of aggression. On the Korean battlefield, the people of Korea and China have already been using their iron fists to strike the American aggressors and their accomplices with increasing force. All over the world, peace-loving people are also carrying out movements against the war of aggression and in defense of world peace. The just struggle launched by the American people—especially the American working class—in the rear of American imperialism has great significance for the cause of defending peace.
    In this strike struggle, the Brooklyn dockworkers have also demonstrated another aspect of their consciousness, namely, when the reactionary trade unions demanded that they return to work, they adopted an attitude of ignoring them, which is completely correct. An historical task facing the American working class is that they must resolutely eliminate the influence of reactionary trade unions among the working masses.
    The Chinese people are very concerned about the strike of the Brooklyn dockworkers and hope that they will achieve a complete victory in the strike.

    声援纽约码头工人的罢工
    据美英资产阶级通讯社所透露的不完全的消息：十五日起纽约布鲁克林陆军码头的码头工人一千余名举行了罢工，十七日，罢工已蔓延到二十几个码头，罢工人数已增至二千余人，罢工的结果，至少已有二十四条船停滞在布鲁克林等地的水面上，使美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜及其他方面的军事运输，受到了有力的打击。布鲁克林码头工人这一罢工行动是符合于美国人民和全世界人民的共同利益的，因而他们受到全世界人民的同情和关怀。
    对美国独占资本家准备发动新战争的罪恶计划，必须从各方面加以打击，才能有效地保卫和平，美国人民才能免于在反动的罪恶的侵略战争中作无谓的牺牲。在朝鲜战场上，朝中两国人民已经用自己的铁拳日益有力地打击着美国侵略军及其帮凶们，在全世界各地，爱好和平的人们也正在进行着反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的运动，美国人民——尤其是美国工人阶级在美帝国主义的后方所发动的正义斗争，对保卫和平的事业有重大的意义。
    布鲁克林码头工人在这一次的罢工斗争中，还表示他们另一方面的觉悟性。即当着反动工会要求他们复工的时候，他们采取了不理的态度，这是完全正确的。美国工人阶级面对着的一个历史任务，即是必须坚决肃清反动工会在工人群众中的影响。
    中国人民十分关怀布鲁克林码头工人的罢工，并希望他们在罢工中取得完全的胜利。
