Long Live the Great Chinese People's Volunteer Army

October 25th marks the first anniversary of the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure to fight abroad. Over the past year, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, in order to defend the security of their motherland and world peace, have achieved great victories with a resolute and unyielding fighting spirit, giving the American aggressors a heavy blow, driving the enemy from the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. This is a scene from the Fourth Campaign, where Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers are crossing the rapid currents of the Han River to attack the enemy.

Under the heavy blows of the heroic Chinese and Korean People's armies, the American imperialists' aggressive plans have been shattered. Our army has annihilated a large number of enemy effectives and forced the American aggressor troops and their accomplice armies to surrender batch by batch. This is a scene from the Han River South Bank blocking battle, where enemy troops, under our fierce artillery fire, raise their hands to surrender. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fought side by side, forging a deep brotherly friendship, fully demonstrating the great spirit of internationalism. This is a scene from the Second Campaign, where the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army victoriously joined forces on the east coast after clearing the enemy from the Changjin Lake to Wonsan line.

The Chinese people, in order to defend the security of their motherland and peaceful and happy lives, launched a vigorous movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, and Defend the Nation, actively supporting the front lines and striving for greater victories. This is a scene of the Heilongjiang stretcher team of the Chinese People's Volunteer Stretcher Brigade setting out for the front lines.

Under the call to actively support the front lines, health and medical workers across the country have organized volunteer medical teams, surgical teams, and epidemic prevention teams, and have gone to work on the Korean battlefield. This is a scene of the Beijing Volunteer Medical Team shouting slogans such as "Resolutely accept the test of the times, persevere and make contributions to the people!" at the station before their departure. The staff of the Chinese Railway Workers Volunteer Aid Korea Transportation Team persevered in their work day and night, braving enemy air raids, to ensure the supply of materials. This is a scene of the Andong Railway Sub-bureau repair team, working hard to repair the bridge that was destroyed by the enemy.

The staff of the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea Motor Transport Volunteer Team persisted in the transportation work with an indomitable will, transporting ammunition and rations to the front lines in a steady stream.

The heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army over the past year have reversed the situation in Korea and annihilated a large number of enemy effectives. From October 25, 1950, to October 10 this year, the Chinese and Korean People's forces have killed, wounded, and captured more than 387,000 enemy troops, including more than 176,000 American aggressor troops. This is a scene of enemy prisoners being escorted to the rear.

From the time the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fought side by side to October 10 this year, the American aggressor troops in the Korean battlefield have not only been annihilated in large numbers, but have also suffered huge losses in material resources, with 2,310 aircraft shot down, damaged, and captured. In addition, the United States has consumed more than 15 million tons of combat materials and more than 10 billion US dollars in war expenses in the Korean War. This is the best proof that the American aggressors are heading for failure. The picture shows the wreckage of an enemy plane shot down by the Chinese and Korean People's forces (right) and an enemy tank destroyed (left).

In the intervals between battles, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army helped the Korean people who suffered disasters at any time, showing the close friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. This is a scene of Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers helping the Korean people carry water. The Chinese people donated a large number of comfort goods and comfort bags to the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the Korean people to express their condolences. By the end of May this year, the people of the whole country had donated a total of 118.602359915 billion yuan in cash, more than 770,000 comfort bags, and more than 1.26 million pieces of comfort goods. This is a scene of the comfort goods and comfort bags donated by people from all walks of life in Beijing being loaded onto trucks in preparation for transportation to the Korean front lines.

At the invitation of the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army had sent representatives back to the country since the end of February this year to report to people from all walks of life across the country on their heroic deeds in resisting American aggression on the front lines. This is a scene of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning representatives arriving in Kunming and being warmly welcomed by the people. At the end of March this year, the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association sent a Chinese People's Delegation to Korea and its affiliated cultural and art troupe, totaling 575 people, to the front lines and rear areas of Korea to express their condolences to the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the Korean people. This is a scene of the delegation holding a comfort meeting with more than 3,000 people participating on the front lines near the 38th parallel.

The people of the whole country are actively launching a movement to donate money for airplanes and artillery to resist America and aid Korea and consolidate and strengthen the national defense. As of October 12 this year, the people of the whole country have pledged to donate 2,482 airplanes, 134 artillery pieces, 83 anti-aircraft guns, and 4 tanks. At present, donations have reached more than 23 trillion yuan, accounting for more than half of the total pledged. This is a scene of the people of Linpu Town, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, enthusiastically paying donations.

Over the past year, in order to enhance the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, the Chinese people have widely launched a patriotic production competition. Chinese workers and farmers have created brilliant achievements in the great patriotic production competition and the patriotic bumper harvest movement. This is a scene of the workers of the Dalian Metal Machinery Factory working hard after responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang group.

People from all walks of life across the country have universally carried out the work of giving preferential treatment and providing pensions to the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, inspiring the morale of the front lines and strengthening the ties between the army and the people, making the movement to resist America and aid Korea more in-depth. This is a scene of Grandpa Wang, a family member of a volunteer soldier in Beijing, receiving congratulations and condolences from the district people's government and the people because his son, Wang Rui, had performed meritorious service on the front lines.
