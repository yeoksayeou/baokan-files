Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 23rd: The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 22nd titled "Further Strengthen the Support Work for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," saying: Under the just banner of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army has come to the Korean battlefield to fight to defeat the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people – the American imperialist aggressors – for a year now.

As everyone knows, the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army came to the Korean battlefield to aid the just struggle of the Korean people during the most difficult and serious period when our People's Army had no choice but to implement a temporary retreat. In close cooperation with the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has carried out many victorious battles, starting from the battle a year ago to annihilate and wipe out the enemies who had invaded north of the Chongchon River. In fierce battles with the enemy, the warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the Korean People's Army, demonstrated to the world the invincible strength of collective heroism and internationalism, established brilliant achievements, and produced countless combat heroes well-known and loved by the Korean people.

The editorial pointed out: This selfless assistance from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the warm support and solidarity from the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet people have strengthened the Korean people's confidence in victory in their struggle for independence and freedom a thousandfold. This brotherly unity between the Korean and Chinese people will surely win the final victory, and the American aggressors will surely suffer a shameful and complete defeat.

The editorial continued: The warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with a high degree of internationalism and patriotism, fight on the Korean battlefield at the cost of their own lives, and have forged a brotherly fighting friendship with the Korean people with their own blood. Therefore, the Korean people unanimously offer their warm gratitude and high respect to the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteer Army; and regard the work of wholeheartedly and wholeheartedly supporting the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as their glorious task. The editorial pointed out: More extensive support work for the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is one of the most important tasks facing the Korean people today. The editorial finally called on: The entire Korean people should further strengthen the work of supporting and comforting the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to repay the selfless struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the independence and freedom of the Korean people under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and strive for the final victory.
