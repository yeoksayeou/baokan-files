Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 27th: Chinese People's Volunteer Army repatriation representatives Chai Chuanruo and others wrote a letter to the people of the motherland, reporting on their return to the front lines to report to the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army about the motherland's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The letter said:

	After returning to the Korean front, we have reported to Commander Peng Dehuai and General Kim Il-sung, and have given seven reports to the troops. After hearing about the motherland's love for the Volunteer Army and its enthusiastic support for the front lines, the commanders and fighters felt as if they had returned to the motherland themselves. Chen Defa, squad leader of the 4th squad of the guard company of a certain unit, said: "We have only been away from the motherland for a year, and I didn't expect the motherland to progress so quickly. My mother recently wrote to me, asking me to work hard and kill the enemy bravely at the front. This is my mother's hope, and it is also the hope of the people of the motherland. I will definitely work hard and fight bravely to defend my mother and defend my motherland." Cook Gao Junshan said: "The people of the motherland love us so much, we must live up to them. I guarantee to cook good meals so that my comrades can eat their fill and fight the American devils." Soldier Ni Qingshan said: "I was greatly moved after hearing about the enthusiastic patriotic production competition launched by the worker brothers. For example, this year's cotton clothes are of good quality and durable, and the buttons are sewn on tightly. There are also two emergency kits and a sewing kit in the pockets of the clothes. The people of the motherland are so considerate to us. I will definitely eliminate more enemies to repay the motherland." After listening to the reports, many commanders and combatants checked their own resolutions and plans. Some units launched a letter-writing campaign, calling on everyone to write a letter to the people of the motherland to express their determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

	On the 20th, we went to various units of the Volunteer Army and the People's Army to give reports. We guarantee to tell every commander and fighter of the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army about the love and hope of the people of the motherland, so that they all know how our people of the motherland are supporting the war of resistance against the United States.

	Currently, fierce battles are still going on on the Korean battlefield. The enemy attacks us every day, and our troops are still fighting bravely and arduously. But our Volunteer Army and People's Army are getting stronger as we fight, and we are eliminating a large number of enemies every day.

	With the support of the people of the motherland, our conditions for combat, work, and life have improved a lot, but the tasks before us are still very heavy. Our troops are launching a conservation movement in order to better utilize the material strength of the motherland's support and more effectively strike our enemies.

	As the armistice negotiations resume, we must strive for peace to realize the common aspirations of peace-loving people all over the world, and at the same time, we must be on high alert and ready to defeat any enemies who dare to continue to risk invading the north. We hope that the people of the motherland will continue to display their patriotism and internationalism, further develop the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and strive to defend peace and win victory!
Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 27th: Chinese People's Volunteer Army repatriation representatives Chai Chuanruo and others reported to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as well as the leaders of the Volunteer Army Headquarters, on the 19th about their work in the motherland for the past six months and the situation of the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

	Chai Chuanruo said: "The motherland's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has penetrated every place and every person. Workers are enthusiastically carrying out patriotic production competitions; farmers are proposing to increase grain production to support the front lines; people from all walks of life are actively participating in practical actions such as formulating patriotic covenants, donating airplanes and cannons, and giving preferential treatment to military families, strengthening the resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and striving for final victory."

	After listening to the report, General Peng Dehuai said to Chai Chuanruo and others: "You have successfully completed the task of reporting to the people of the motherland the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side at the front. Now, you must also convey the situation of the motherland's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to the troops. This is another important task, which is a great encouragement to all commanders and combatants, and also a very good and very practical education in patriotism and internationalism."

	Finally, Chai Chuanruo and others transferred the gifts presented by the people of the motherland to Commander Peng Dehuai and General Kim Il-sung to them one by one.

    柴川若等写信给祖国人民
    回到朝鲜前线后已向金日成彭德怀将军作了汇报
    各部队听了他们的报告后战志更为昂扬
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若等写信给祖国人民，报告他们返抵前线后向志愿军指战员报告祖国抗美援朝运动的情况。这封信说：
    我们回到朝鲜前线后，已经向彭德怀司令员、金日成将军作过汇报，并向部队作了七次报告。指战员们听到祖国人民热爱志愿军和热烈支援前线的情况后，都觉得好像自己也回到祖国去了一次一样。某部警卫连四班长陈德发说：“我们离开祖国只有
    一年，想不到祖国进步得这样快。我母亲最近来信说，要我在前方好好工作，努力杀敌。这是我母亲的希望，也是祖国人民的希望。我一定努力工作，英勇战斗，保卫母亲，保卫祖国。”炊事员高俊山说：“祖国人民这样热爱我们，我们一定要对得起他们。我保证把饭作好，让战友们吃饱了好打美国鬼子。”战士倪青山说：“我听了工人弟兄们热烈展开爱国主义生产竞赛的情形后，受了很大的感动。譬如今年的棉衣布又好又结实，扣子也缝得牢牢的。衣服口袋里还装着两个救急包、一个针线包。祖国人民替我们想的太周到了。我一定要消灭更多的敌人来报答祖国。”许多指挥员、战斗员在听了报告后，纷纷检查自己的决心计划。有的单位开展了一封信运动，号召每一人给祖国人民写一封信，表示自己抗美援朝的决心。
    我们于二十日分别到志愿军和人民军的各个部队去作报告。我们保证把祖国人民的热爱与希望告诉志愿军和朝鲜人民军的每一个指挥员与战斗员，让他们都知道我们祖国人民是在怎样地支援着抗美战争的。
    目前朝鲜战场上，严重的战斗仍在进行。敌人每天向我们进攻，我们的部队仍然是英勇地艰苦地战斗着。但我们志愿军和人民军都是越战越强，每天都在大量地消灭敌人。
    我们在祖国人民的支援下，战斗、工作和生活的条件都已改善了很多，但摆在我们面前的任务仍很重大。我们部队正在展开节约运动，以便更好地发挥祖国人民支援的物质力量更有效地打击我们的敌人。
    当此停战谈判重新恢复之际，我们一面当力争和平，以实现全世界爱好和平人民的共同愿望；一面当严阵以待，随时准备击败敢于继续冒险北犯的敌人。我们希望祖国人民继续发挥爱国主义与国际主义精神，进一步地开展抗美援朝运动，为保卫和平、争取胜利而奋斗！
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若等，于十九日向朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员及志愿军总部各首长报告他们归国半年来的工作及中国人民抗美援朝运动的情况。
    柴川若说：“祖国抗美援朝运动已经深入到每一地、每一人，工人们热烈进行爱国主义生产大竞赛；农民们提出增产粮食，支援前线；各界人民踊跃地参加订立爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮、优待军属等实际行动，加强抗美援朝，为争取最后胜利而努力。”
    彭德怀将军在听取报告后对柴川若等说：“你们已经胜利地完成了向祖国人民报告志愿军和朝鲜人民军在前线并肩作战的英勇事迹的任务，现在，你们还要把祖国抗美援朝运动的情况向部队传达，这又是一件重要的任务，这对全体指挥员与战斗员是很大的鼓舞，也是一次很好的、很实际的爱国主义与国际主义的教育。”
    最后，柴川若等把祖国人民献给彭德怀司令员、金日成将军的礼品一一转致他们。
