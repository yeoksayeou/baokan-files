    Wuwei County Water Conservancy Committee Deputy Director Zhang Yue Adopts an Extremely Incorrect Attitude Towards Criticism

    To the Editor:
    Zhang Yue, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Committee of Wuwei County, Anhui Province, takes an extremely wrong attitude towards criticism from the Party newspaper. After the Wanbei Daily published an article on August 26 entitled "Inspection of Flood Control Materials Completed in Wuwei, Many Problems Found in Storage," Zhang Yue immediately flew into a rage, saying: "I have worked for eleven years, and this is the first time my name has appeared in the newspaper! He (referring to the writer) is trying to ruin my career!" He picked up the newspaper, read it aloud angrily in the accounting office, and said: "Look at this, these are all my evil deeds! How can I bear this?" Comrade Zhang Yue has participated in the revolution for eleven years and is a leading cadre. He has made mistakes but refuses to accept criticism, which is extremely wrong.

    During the land reform movement, Comrade Zhang Yue favored his landlord father and insulted emancipated peasants, completely losing the position of a revolutionary cadre. His landlord father was struggled against in this year's land reform, and he said: "What crime has my father committed that they are struggling against him? These people (referring to emancipated peasants and cadres) are incredible in the countryside, they are simply overlords." Comrade Zhang Yue simply treats land reform as a landlord "overlord," completely losing his position.

    I suggest that the Wuwei County People's Government immediately help Comrade Zhang Yue make a profound self-criticism and publish the results of the self-criticism publicly.

    无为县水利委员会副主任张悦对待批评采取不正确态度编辑同志：
    皖北无为县水利委员会副主任张悦以极错误的态度对待党报的批评。八月二十六日皖北日报发表了“无为防汛器材检查结束，保管方面发现很多问题”一文后，张悦即大发雷霆，说：“我干了十一年工作，我这个名字头一次上报纸！他（指写稿人）这样搞，是想要砸我的饭碗！”他拿起报纸，到会计室怒气冲冲地读了一遍后说：“你们看看，这都是我的罪恶事实啊！我还吃得消吗？”张悦同志参加革命十一年，身为领导干部，自己有了错误，却不接受批评，这是十分不对的。
    张悦同志在土地改革运动中，曾偏袒他的地主父亲，侮辱翻身农民，完全丧失了革命干部的立场，他的地主父亲在今年土地改革中受到斗争，他说：“我父亲犯了什么罪啦，他们斗争他？他们这些人
    （指翻身农民和干部）在农村中可了不起啦，简直是些老爷。”张悦同志简直是以地主“老爷”的身份来看待土地改革，完全丧失了立场。
    我建议无为县人民政府立即帮助张悦同志作深刻检讨，并将检讨结果公开发表。
