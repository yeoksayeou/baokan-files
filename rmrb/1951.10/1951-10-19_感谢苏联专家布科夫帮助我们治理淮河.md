    Thanks to Soviet Expert Bukov for Helping Us Harness the Huai River
    To the Editor:
    Comrade Qian Zhengying, Deputy Minister of the Huai River Harnessing Committee's Engineering Department, greatly educated me with her introduction at the Second Annual Meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the opening ceremony of the National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on the fifth of this month regarding Soviet expert Bukov's internationalist spirit and contributions to harnessing the Huai River. During his work, Comrade Bukov suffered a recurrence of his eye disease due to overwork. Despite doctors advising him to rest and receive treatment, he disregarded everything and persisted in his work while ill. He said he had to complete this task because Chairman Mao said:
    "We must harness the Huai River well." What a great internationalist spirit, what a conscientious and responsible work attitude!
    I am a person from the Huai River basin and have personally experienced the disasters brought by the Huai River for over a decade. However, this year I personally witnessed the two bumper harvests after the successful completion of the first year of the Huai River harnessing project; the former marshland has become fertile fields; the former ruins have been replaced by new houses. I deeply experienced the happiness of living in the big family of New China and the superiority of the New Democratic system. But the victory of harnessing the Huai River is inseparable from the help of Soviet friend Comrade Bukov. He loves our leader and people as much as he loves his own leader and people. We must master the advanced technology introduced to us by Comrade Bukov, and we must learn his great internationalist spirit. Let us pay tribute to the great Soviet Union, and pay tribute to our dear Comrade Bukov!

    感谢苏联专家布科夫帮助我们治理淮河编辑同志：
    治淮委员会工程部副部长钱正英同志，本月五日在中苏友好协会总会二届年会及中苏友好协会全国代表会议开幕会上所介绍的苏联专家布科夫的国际主义精神和对治淮的贡献，给了我很大的教育。布科夫同志在工作期间，曾因疲劳过度，眼病复发，医生劝告他治疗休养，但他不顾一切，带病坚持工作。他说他必须完成这个任务，因为毛主席讲了：
    “一定要把淮河修好”。这是多么伟大的国际主义精神，多么认真负责的工作态度！
    我是淮河沿岸的人民，我曾亲身经历过十几年来淮河带来的灾害。可是今年我亲眼看到了第一年治淮工程胜利完成后的两季大丰收；昔日的泽国已变成了良田；昔日的废墟已盖起了新屋。我深深地体验到生活在新中国大家庭里的幸福以及新民主主义制度的优越。但治淮的胜利是和苏联友人布科夫同志的帮助分不开的。他爱我们的领袖和人民，一如爱他自己的领袖和人民。我们一定要掌握布科夫同志介绍给我们的先进技术，一定要学习他伟大的国际主义精神。让我们向伟大的苏联致敬，向亲爱的布科夫同志致敬！
