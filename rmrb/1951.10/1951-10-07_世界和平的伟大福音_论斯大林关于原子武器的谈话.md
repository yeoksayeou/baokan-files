    The Great Gospel of World Peace
    —On Stalin's Talk About Atomic Weapons
    On October 6th, the Soviet "Pravda" published Comrade Stalin's answers to questions from a "Pravda" reporter regarding the issue of atomic weapons. Stalin very clearly expounded on the role of the Soviet Union's mastery of atomic weapons, and the Soviet Union's sincere position and desire for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the implementation of international control of atomic weapons.
    Undoubtedly, Stalin's talk is a great gospel of world peace. It once again severely struck the aggressive delusions of the American atomic warmongers, and greatly encouraged the peace-loving people of the world, adding infinite confidence to the cause of defending world peace.
    People know that as early as 1947, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky announced: "If, unfortunately, atomic bombs are ever needed, we will have as many atomic bombs as necessary." And only the Soviet Union pays attention to using atomic energy for peaceful construction. At the same time, people also know that after creating the first atomic bomb, the United States has been trying to monopolize atomic secrets as a tool to realize its aggressive ambitions. Since the end of World War II, the United States has never stopped manufacturing atomic weapons, and has repeatedly used atomic weapons to intimidate the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and the people of the world. In the face of the people of the world, the United States has put on the cannibalistic posture of an atomic monster. Therefore, for a long time, the ruling class of the United States has been addicted to the superstition of atomic warmongering. Under such circumstances, in order to safeguard the security of socialist countries and world peace, the Soviet Union had to possess atomic weapons. Stalin said very clearly: "If the United States attacks our country, the American ruling groups will use atomic bombs. It is precisely because of this situation that the Soviet Union has had to possess atomic weapons in order to be fully prepared to deal with aggressors."
    Obviously, the United States' panic about the Soviet Union possessing atomic weapons is unfounded; the various cries of American figures about the threat to American security are extremely ridiculous. As Stalin said: "Because the Soviet Union has never had the idea of attacking the United States or any other country." The Soviet Union has consistently and firmly advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons and the cessation of the production of atomic weapons, and it is none other than the United States and its vassal states that have repeatedly rejected the Soviet Union's just demands. From this, it is not difficult to know that what the United States actually feels is the sorrow and distress of the disillusionment of atomic warmongering, and nothing else.
    Precisely because of this, the Soviet Union's possession of atomic weapons is not a symbol of war, but a gospel of world peace. Because this first deprives the United States of the possibility of intimidating and defrauding other countries as the monopolist of the atomic bomb, thereby greatly enhancing the power and confidence of the people of the world in defending peace. At the same time, it is only the fact that other countries, first of all the Soviet Union, possess atomic weapons, that may make the United States believe in the futility of atomic warmongering, and thus create the possibility of banning atomic weapons. Stalin said well: "I think that only when those who advocate atomic bombs see that they are no longer monopolists, will they agree to ban atomic weapons."
    In his talk, Stalin once again clarified the Soviet Union's solemn position on implementing international control of atomic weapons, and powerfully exposed the hypocritical lies of the United States' so-called "control" of atomic weapons. This greatly helped the people of the world to further recognize the true face of the American atomic warmongers. Under such circumstances, if the United States continues to insist on and talk about its completely bankrupt atomic bomb monopoly policy and the "control" lie, it will only arouse greater anger from the people of the world, and take more direct and effective actions to defeat the American atomic bandits.
    Stalin's talk taught all peace-loving people in the world: only by holding our own weapons tightly can we make the enemy lay down their weapons. The Soviet Union's production of atomic weapons and the Chinese people's resistance to the U.S. and aid to Korea are all for the same purpose. Let the peace-loving people of the world fight forward along the path indicated by Stalin! Victory belongs to us!

    世界和平的伟大福音
    ——论斯大林关于原子武器的谈话
    本月六日苏联真理报刊载了斯大林同志关于原子武器问题的答真理报记者问。斯大林极其清楚地阐明了苏联掌握原子武器的作用和苏联对禁用原子武器与实行原子武器国际管制的真诚主张和愿望。
    无疑的，斯大林的这个谈话是世界和平的一个伟大福音，它又一次严重地打击了美国原子黩武主义者的侵略妄想，并使世界爱好和平人民获得了极大的鼓舞，对保卫世界和平事业增加了无限信心。
    人们知道，早在一九四七年，苏联外长维辛斯基就宣布过：“假若一旦不幸需要原子弹时，我们将会有必需的那样多的原子弹。”并且只有苏联注意将原子能使用于和平建设。同时，人们也知道，美国在造成第一颗原子弹之后，就一直企图垄断原子秘密，作为实现它侵略野心的工具。从第二次世界大战结束以来，美国就没有停止过原子武器的制造，并不止一次地借着原子武器来向苏联、人民民主国家和世界各国人民实行恫吓。在世界人民的面前，美国摆出了原子魔王的吃人姿态。因此，在很长的时间以来，美国的统治阶级中就流行着原子黩武主义的迷信。在这种情形下，为了保卫社会主义国家的安全与世界和平，苏联便不能不备有原子武器。斯大林说得很明白：“一旦美国进攻我们国家，美国统治集团就将使用原子弹。就是由于这种情况，苏联才不得不备有原子武器，以便有充分的准备对付侵略者。”
    显然，美国对于苏联拥有原子武器的惊慌，是毫无根据的；美国形形色色的人物关于美国的安全受到威胁的叫嚣，是极端可笑的。正如斯大林所说：“因为苏联并没有在什么时候进攻美国或其他任何国家的想法。”苏联过去和现在都一贯坚决主张禁止原子武器，停止原子武器的生产，而屡次拒绝苏联这种正义主张的不是别人，正是美国及其附庸国家。由此不难知道，美国所感到的实际上是原子黩武主义幻灭的悲哀和苦恼，而不是别的。
    正因为如此，苏联之备有原子武器不但不是战争的象征，而是世界和平的福音。因为这首先就剥夺了美国以原子弹的垄断者向其他国家实行恫吓和诈讹的可能性，从而大大地增强了世界人民保卫和平的力量和信心。同时，也只有其他国家，首先是苏联备有原子武器的事实，才有可能使美国相信原子黩武主义的毫无好处，从而也就产生了禁止原子武器的可能性。斯大林说得好：“我想，只有鼓吹原子弹的人看到他们已不再是垄断者的时候，他们才可能同意禁止原子武器。”
    斯大林在谈话中再次阐明了苏联对于实行原子武器国际管制的严正主张，并有力地揭穿了美国的所谓“管制”原子武器的伪善谎言。这大大地帮助了世界人民进一步认识了美国原子黩武主义者的真面目。在这种情况下，美国再要继续坚持和谈论它的已经彻底破产了的原子弹垄断政策和“管制”谎言，就只有激起世界人民的更大愤怒，而为击败美国原子强盗采取更为直接的和有效的行动。
    斯大林的谈话教导了全世界爱好和平的人们：只有紧握着自己的武器，才能使敌人放下武器。苏联的生产原子武器和中国人民的抗美援朝，都是为了同样的目的。世界爱好和平的人民循着斯大林所指示的道路奋斗前进吧！胜利是属于我们的！
