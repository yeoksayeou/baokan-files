    Defend Our Free and Happy Life
    People's Liberation Army National Day Observance Delegate, Combat Hero Hu Xuesheng

    After the liberation of the Southwest region, our unit was assigned the task of suppressing bandits. Because we relied on the masses, we have basically eliminated the bandits in the past year or so.

    When the bandit suppression began, I was a platoon leader. At that time, I thought: I had performed meritorious service in the Huaihai Campaign, in the advance to the Great Southwest, and I should also devote all my strength to eliminating harm for the people in the bandit suppression. All the comrades in our platoon also had this determination. The bandit suppression struggle of more than a year was even more arduous than the liberation of the Great Southwest. The bandits were hiding in the deep mountains and dense forests. Regardless of night or day, as long as we knew the whereabouts of the bandits, I would lead the comrades to move out. Sometimes we climbed eighty or ninety *li* of mountain roads; sometimes we pursued continuously for three or four days, without food, we just tightened our belts; without shoes, we climbed the mountains barefoot. The comrades were not afraid of hardship or fatigue, and seized the time to publicize the bandit suppression policy and win over the coerced elements to start anew. We helped the masses with production and labor, the relationship between the army and the people became closer, and we gained more active assistance from the people. Once, I led twenty people to capture the bandit leader Xiao Shiliang, and it took us two days to catch up. Bandit Xiao was hiding in a large forest near Jinkeng. We were few in number and could not surround the forest. So I went to Jinkeng and Niudachang villages, and mobilized more than a hundred people to participate in the mountain search through the farmers' associations. When searching the mountains, we were afraid of hurting the common people, so a soldier led a dozen or so people in front. Xiao bandit was finally caught by soldier Li Chenglu.

    In the past year or so, our platoon has eliminated more than 300 bandits and captured more than 40 bandit leaders above the company commander level.

    After the bandits were wiped out, the people lived in peace. Now, in the places where the land reform has been completed, large-scale production has begun, and the people's lives have improved. In the past, Guizhou was full of wasteland, but now the mountain tops are also planted with corn and cotton. Seeing this, everyone is happy! This is just the beginning of construction, how good the days will be in the future! Thinking of this, I think of Korea. If American imperialism wants to attack China, wouldn't we be the same as Korea? From this, I understand even more the truth that "the People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force," and also understand more the truth of Chairman Mao's call to us to "establish a regularized and modernized national defense army." The comrades in our company also understand this truth even more, and everyone is more motivated. During military training in July and August this year, all the comrades studied and trained hard. I was promoted to company commander, and my responsibility is even greater. To be a good company commander of a regular national defense army, I have to study hard. I study with the soldiers, solicit their opinions, and improve the training methods. As a result, our company was rated as a training model company. All the comrades in our company are not satisfied with this achievement. We are determined to study and train even harder in the future, improve our skills, defend the motherland, defend peace in the Far East and the world, and defend our free and happy life.

    保卫我们自由幸福的生活
    人民解放军国庆节观礼代表战斗英雄  胡学胜
    西南地区解放后，我们部队担任了剿匪的任务。因为我们依靠了群众，一年多来基本上肃清了土匪。
    剿匪开始时，我是排长。当时我想：我在淮海战役中立过功，在向大西南进军中立过功，在剿匪中，也应该尽全部力量，为人民除害。我们全排的同志也都有这个决心。一年多的剿匪斗争，比起解放大西南来还要艰苦。土匪隐藏在深山密林里。不管黑夜白天，只要知道了土匪的下落，我就带领同志们出动。有时候连爬八、九十里的山路；有时连续追击三、四天，吃不上饭，我们就紧紧裤腰带；没有鞋穿，就赤脚爬山。同志们不怕苦，不怕累，抓紧时间宣传剿匪政策，争取胁从分子自新。我们帮助群众生产劳动，军民关系更加亲密，取得了人民更积极的协助。有一次我带领二十个人去捕捉匪首萧世良，连追了两天才追上。萧匪藏在金坑附近一个大森林里。我们人少，围不住森林。我就去金坑、牛大场两村，通过农民协会动员了一百多名群众参加搜山。在搜山时，我们怕伤了老百姓，就由一个战士在前面带领十几个老百姓。萧匪最后被战士李成禄捉住了。
    一年多以来，我们这一排就这样消灭了三百多土匪，捉住中队长以上的土匪头子四十多个。
    土匪被剿灭后，人民安生了。现在土地改革完成的地方，已经开始大生产，人民的生活改善了。过去，贵州到处是荒地，现在山头上也种满苞谷、棉花。看到这些，谁心里也高兴！这才是建设的开头，以后的日子该是多好啊！一想到这里，我就想到朝鲜。美帝国主义要打到中国，咱们还不是和朝鲜一样？从这里我更懂得了“人民解放军永远是战斗队”的道理，也更懂得了毛主席号召我们的“要建立一支正规化、现代化的国防军”的道理。我们连里同志也都更明白了这个道理，大家都越干越有劲。今年七、八月间练兵，同志们个个都苦学苦练。我升为连长，责任更重了。要当好一个正规的国防军的连长，还得好好学习。我就跟战士们一起学习，征求战士们的意见，改进练兵方法。结果，我们连被评为练兵模范连。我们全连同志对这个成绩并不满足。我们决心今后更加苦学苦练，练好本领，保卫祖国，保卫远东和世界和平，保卫我们自由幸福的生活。
