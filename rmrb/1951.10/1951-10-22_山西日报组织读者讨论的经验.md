    Shanxi Daily's Experience in Organizing Reader Discussions
    Wu Xiang
    To conduct ideological discussions in newspapers for the revolutionary education of the people is an important way for the Party to realize political and ideological leadership among the masses and to strengthen the ideological content of newspapers. The several ideological discussions conducted by Shanxi Daily since September have demonstrated this role and effectiveness. It has not only attracted the participation of a large number of readers but also greatly enriched the ideological content of the newspaper. However, the editorial department went through a process of exploration in organizing and leading this discussion. There were successful experiences and lessons learned from failures.
    Taking the recent discussion on the "Lancang Incident" as an example, in order to correct the ideas of underestimating the enemy and being paralyzed that occurred after the suppression of the counter-revolutionaries, the editorial department used the Lancang special agent murder case (11 people died and 38 were injured) as a typical material to educate the people, criticize the neglect of politics, and ideas of underestimating the enemy and being paralyzed, and organized readers to launch discussions. On September 8, while publishing this news, Shanxi Daily called on everyone in the editorial titled "Resolutely Eliminate Special Agents and Bandits, Avenge the Workers and Peasants Brothers Killed in Lancang!" to accept this lesson of blood, "Conduct a general inspection and discussion in every factory and village in the province, among all cadres and the masses, and thoroughly expose and oppose any erroneous tendencies of neglecting politics and underestimating the enemy and being paralyzed." At the same time, the newspaper also sent people to the reading groups in factories, mines, and villages to understand the reactions of the masses. Therefore, after the discussion on the Lancang Incident was launched in the newspaper on September 9, in just half a month by the 24th, the newspaper received as many as 361 letters and manuscripts from all over the country. Many government offices, schools, workshops, and mutual aid groups also held symposiums. In addition to expressing extreme anger at the crimes of the special agents and bandits, they also criticized the paralyzed thinking of their respective units and improved everyone's political vigilance. However, many confused ideas were also exposed in the discussion. For example, some people in the No. 1 Branch of the Taiyuan Public Security Bureau believed that the occurrence of the Lancang Incident was because we suppressed the counter-revolutionaries "too much," forcing them to have no way out and resorting to murder. Individual businessmen also believed that the Lancang Incident occurred in the theater, and they would not be harmed if they did not watch the play in the future. The editors promptly pointed out this kind of enemy-friend distinction, erroneous position; and criticized it, guiding the discussion to go one step further, and combining it with inspection of work and inspection of thoughts. After Zhang Genjie, the mastermind of the "Lancang Incident," was captured on September 21, the newspaper published an editorial on the 28th titled "Continue to Launch the Discussion on the Lancang Incident" at the same time as announcing the news, so that the discussion gradually developed into a province-wide mass discussion. Propagandists and reading personnel in various places used the discussions in the newspaper to promote to the masses and organize them to participate in the discussions; the editorial department often concentrated the educational problems in the mass discussions and added "Editor's Notes" to publish them in the newspaper. For example, after the initial inspection of the leading organs of Yangqu County and the district head of the Second District and the cadres of Shanglancang Village was published on September 30 and October 3 respectively, it was found that the main reason for the growth of paralyzed thinking among the cadres was the failure to establish a long-term concept of fighting the enemy. Therefore, in the "Editor's Note" of the "Lancang Incident Discussion" on October 14, the direction of in-depth discussion was further pointed out: "We must establish a long-term view of fighting the enemy in order to completely overcome paralyzed thinking." This not only led the readers' discussion step by step, so that the Lancang Incident became a household name and the lesson of blood was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people; but also used the masses' own experiences and feelings to make it easier for the masses to dig out the paralyzed thinking from the root. Because this discussion solved the ideological problems that were generally present among the masses, the ideological connection between the newspaper and the masses was relatively close, and the newspaper showed vigorous vitality.
    In organizing this discussion, Shanxi Daily deeply realized that organizing readers to conduct ideological discussions in newspapers is indeed one of the important ways to strengthen the ideological work of newspapers; however, the newspaper has experienced some twists and turns and some deviations in learning to use this method.
    Last autumn, the newspaper organized a discussion on the bureaucratic style of the Director of Justice of Dingxiang County. This discussion lasted for more than a month. At that time, it played a certain role in implementing the opposition to bureaucracy, strengthening the connection between the Party and the government and the masses, and promoting the rectification movement of cadres in the judicial department and other departments. In the spring of this year, discussions on the bandit riots in Jishan and other issues were also held, and considerable results were achieved. When we summarized this work, everyone felt that this method was very good and needed to be promoted. This is correct. However, because we did not carefully study and understand the experience in these discussions, the promotion was promoted, but the deviation of rashly raising questions and launching discussions occurred. In July and August of this year, five or six discussions were launched in the newspaper at the same time. Of course, this cannot concentrate efforts to truly unfold and thoroughly solve the problems to be discussed. Sometimes there is such a situation: the call to organize readers to launch discussions is put forward, but no discussion is organized. Even the editors themselves are not clear about what purpose this discussion should achieve and what steps should be taken. If there are manuscripts, they will be published, and if there are no manuscripts, they will be dropped; intermittently, seemingly absent, not like a discussion at all. For example, the discussion on "Is it right not to report counter-revolutionaries" from June 4 to August 13 was as pointed out in the "Reader Discussion is an Important Way to Strengthen the Ideological Work of Newspapers" column of the People's Daily on September 8, and it appeared to be poor and weak. The reason is that although the editors called on readers to conduct discussions, they did not seriously treat this discussion, seriously do the organizational work, unfold the discussion, and conduct a principled and profound criticism of erroneous ideas from the fundamental ideology of the people's democratic dictatorship.
    Another similar example is the discussion on the issues of "the nature of the Party" and "the leadership of the revolution" (starting from August 2). Before launching such a significant discussion, the newspaper's preparation work was very inadequate. Without formulating a discussion plan or specifically organizing forces, it started in a hurry. After the questions were raised, although there were many manuscripts, most of them were superficial discussions that did not touch the actual work or actual ideas. The editors were afraid that the discussion would be deserted, so they prematurely published some papers that should have been published later, which made some cadres and masses with low theoretical levels dare not speak, and affected the development of the discussion. The newspaper made a review in early September and decided to stop or end some discussions on secondary issues and concentrate on organizing the discussion on the Lancang Incident and the discussion on the nature of the Party. The newspaper prepared to sort out the several confused ideas and their arguments that have been collected, and send them to the Party committees at all levels and readers in various places to mobilize everyone to analyze and criticize them. The Theoretical Education Department of the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Provincial Party School, the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, and the Shanxi Daily Editorial Department formed the core organization leading the discussion, absorbing several cadres working in factories and mines to further study the methods of eliminating various confused ideas and determine the direction and steps for continued discussion. The newspaper sent people to schools and factories to organize small-scale symposiums, and widely mobilized the propaganda cadres of the Party committees at all levels and the students of the Party schools at all levels to write their experiences and thoughts, and concentrated and organized the positive and negative arguments (the problem of solving the ideological problems of peasants and the problem of solving the ideological problems of intellectuals were separated), and published them continuously to make the discussion truly unfold. Then, according to the problems found in the discussion, comrades with more theoretical cultivation were invited to write summary papers or reprint relevant papers from the central responsible comrades. Finally, make a conclusion. After specific organization, the ideological content of the manuscripts was relatively rich, so the discussion was also lively. For example, Dong Zhenyi's article published on September 20 analyzed from a theoretical point of view with his own personal experience and criticized the past erroneous ideas of not recognizing the leadership of the working class, which was more persuasive. Agricultural labor model Li Shunda, etc., had many practical experiences of the greatness of the working class when they visited factories or industrial exhibitions in the past. Therefore, in the discussion published on September 18, they unanimously believed that industry must lead agriculture. These articles are very kind and powerful.
    Organizing reader discussions is one of the important ways to strengthen the ideological content of newspapers. However, it is not enough to just understand this point. We must seriously treat this method of publicizing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and we must never raise questions and launch discussions rashly. Once raised, there must be a clear purpose, specific steps, and full preparation to seriously unfold the discussion and raise the problem to a theoretical level to solve it.

    山西日报组织读者讨论的经验
    吴象
    在报纸上展开思想问题的讨论，对人民群众进行革命的教育，乃是党在人民群众中实现政治思想领导和加强报纸思想性的重要方式之一。山西日报从九月份以来所进行的几个思想问题的讨论，就曾显示了这一作用和成效。它不仅吸引了广大读者的参加，并且大大充实了报纸的思想内容。但编辑部组织领导这一讨论时，却是经历了一个摸索的过程。有成功的经验，也有失败的教训。
    就以最近“兰村事件”的讨论为例，编辑部为了纠正镇压反革命运动以后发生的轻敌麻痹思想，即以兰村特务凶杀事件（死亡群众十一人，受伤三十八人），作为教育人民群众，批判忽视政治和轻敌麻痹思想的典型材料，组织读者展开了讨论。九月八日在与公布这一消息同时，山西日报即在题为“坚决扑灭特务匪徒，为兰村被害的工农兄弟复仇！”的社论中，号召大家必须接受这次血的教训，“在全省每个工厂和农村中，在所有干部和群众中，普遍进行一次检查与讨论，彻底揭发并反对任何忽视政治与轻敌麻痹的错误倾向”。同时，报社又派人深入厂矿和农村的读报组，了解群众反应。所以，从九月九日在报上展开对兰村事件的讨论以后，到二十四日仅及半月，报社即收到各地来信、来稿达三百六十一件之多。许多机关、学校、车间、互助组并召开了座谈会，除对特务匪徒这种凶杀的罪行表示万分愤怒外，并各对本单位的麻痹思想作了批判，提高了大家的政治警惕性。但讨论中也暴露出许多糊涂观念，比如太原市公安一分局的某些人，就认为兰村事件的发生，是由于我们对反革命分子镇压得“太过火”了，逼得他们无路可走，才下毒手凶杀群众。还有个别商人认为兰村事件是发生在戏场里，以后不看戏就不致于受害了。编者及时指出这种敌我不分、立场错误的说法；并进行批判，引导讨论深入一步，使其与检查工作、检查思想结合起来。当“兰村事件”祸首张根杰于九月二十一日被捕获后，报社又于二十八日和公布这一消息同时，发表了“继续展开对兰村事件的讨论”的社论，使讨论逐渐发展成为全省规模的群众性的讨论。各地的宣传员、读报员根据报上的讨论，向群众宣传，并组织群众参加讨论；编辑部则经常把群众讨论中具有教育意义的问题集中起来，再加上“编者按”，把它在报上发表。例如，在九月三十日、十月三日先后发表了阳曲县领导机关和二区区长、上兰村干部的初步检查后，发现干部中滋长麻痹思想的主要原因，是没有树立长期的对敌斗争观念。因而，在十月十四日“兰村事件讨论”的“编者按”中，即进一步指出深入讨论的方向：“必须树立长期的对敌斗争观点，才能彻底克服麻痹思想。”这样不仅把读者的讨论步步引向深入，使兰村事件家喻户晓，血的教训深入人心；而且用群众自己的经验和体会，更易使群众从根上挖掉麻痹思想。由于这一讨论解决了群众中普遍存在的思想问题，所以，报纸和群众在思想上的联系就比较密切了，而报纸也就显出勃勃的生气。
    山西日报在组织这一讨论中深深体会到：组织读者在报纸上进行思想讨论，确实是加强报纸思想工作的重要方式之一；但报社在学习运用这种方式的时候，却经历过一些曲折，发生过一些偏向。
    在去年秋季，报社就组织过关于定襄司法科长官僚主义作风的讨论。这个讨论持续了一个多月，当时对贯彻反对官僚主义作风、密切党和政府与群众的联系，推动司法部门干部以及其他部门干部的整风运动有一定的作用。今年春天又举行过关于稷山土匪暴乱事件及其他问题的讨论，也收到相当好的效果。我们在总结这一工作时，大家都感到这种方式很好，需要推广。这是对的。但因为我们对这几次讨论没有认真研究、领会其中的经验，结果推广是推广了，却发生了轻率提出问题发动讨论的偏向。今年七、八月间，竟至同时在报纸上发动了五、六种讨论。这样当然不能集中力量把所要讨论的问题真正展开，彻底解决。有时就有这样的情况：组织读者展开讨论的号召是提出来了，却又不去组织讨论。甚至这次讨论要达到什么目的，经过些什么步骤，编者自己的思想也不明确。来了稿子发一发，不来就拉倒；断断续续，似有似无，根本不像个讨论。比如六月四日到八月十三日所进行的关于“对反革命分子不检举对不对”的讨论，就正如九月八日人民日报“文化生活”栏“读者讨论是加强报纸思想工作的重要方式之一”文内所指出的，显得贫乏无力。其原因就是编者虽然号召读者进行讨论，却没有严肃地对待这个讨论，认真地去做组织工作，把讨论展开，并从人民民主专政的根本思想上对错误的思想进行原则性的深刻的批判。
    另一个类似的例子是关于“党的性质”和“革命领导权”问题的讨论（从八月二日开始）。报社在开展这样意义重大的讨论之前，准备工作很不充分。没有订出讨论的计划，没有具体组织力量，就急急忙忙地开始了。问题提出来之后，来稿虽然不少，多是不接触工作实际、思想实际的肤浅论述。编者唯恐使讨论冷落了，过早地发表了一些应该推后发表的论文，致使一些理论水平低的干部和群众不敢发言了，而影响了讨论的开展。报社在九月初作了检讨，决定停止或结束一些对次要问题的讨论，集中力量组织兰村事件的讨论和党的性质的讨论。报社准备先把已搜集到的若干糊涂观念及其论点整理出来，发给各级党委与各地读者，发动大家进行分析批判。以省委宣传部理论教育处、省委党校、太原市委宣传部、山西日报编辑部为主，吸收几个在厂矿工作的干部组成领导讨论的核心组织，进一步研究扫除各种糊涂观念的办法，确定继续讨论的方针和步骤。报社派人到学校、工厂组织小型座谈会，并广泛发动各级党委的宣传干部和各级党校的学员写心得，写感想，把正面的、反面的论点都集中起来，加以组织（解决农民思想的问题与解决知识分子的思想问题分开），连续发表，使讨论真正展开。再根据讨论中发现的问题，邀请较有理论修养的同志写总结性的论文，或转载中央负责同志有关的论文。最后做出结论。经过具体组织，稿件的思想内容比较丰富了，因而讨论也有声有色了。比如九月二十日发表的董振义的文章，以他自己的亲身经历，从理论上来作了分析，批判了过去不承认工人阶级领导的错误思想，说服力就比较大。农业劳动模范李顺达等，过去参观工厂或工业展览时，对工人阶级的伟大有许多实际体会。因此，在九月十八日所发表的讨论中，他们曾一致认为：工业必须领导农业。这些文章都很亲切有力。
    组织读者讨论是加强报纸思想性的重要方式之一。但仅仅懂得这一点还不够，必须严肃地对待这种宣传马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的方式，决不可轻率地提出问题，发动讨论。既经提出就必须有明确的目的，具体的步骤和充分的准备，认真展开讨论，并把问题提高到理论上加以解决。
