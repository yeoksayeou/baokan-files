    The Great Contribution of the National Working Class in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    Lei Ping
    From the Korean front lines to every factory and mine in the motherland, the national working class has contributed immense strength to the Resist America, Aid Korea movement over the past year. From the very beginning when the Volunteer Army went abroad to fight, many workers put on military uniforms and went directly to fight heroically against the American aggressors. Zheng Enxi, a sawyer worker from Yingkou City, bravely seized four enemy machine gun positions in the night attack on Ersheng Mountain on the south bank of the Han River, capturing four light and heavy machine guns, a rocket launcher, an automatic rifle, and a carbine, becoming a special-class merit recipient of a certain unit of the People's Volunteer Army. On the transportation lines in Korea, heroic railway workers and truck drivers overcame enemy bombing and strafing to ensure the supply of the front-line troops. They chiseled through three-foot-thick ice on the "Boiling River" and jumped into the water to repair the river bridge. They used their bare hands to carry away time bombs dropped by enemy planes on the railway lines. The immortal hero railway worker Wang Jingzhou, at the risk of his own life, used his body to stop the wheels to rescue a train loaded with weapons and ammunition. These glorious deeds have inspired the people of the whole country to wage an even more heroic and resolute struggle against American imperialism.
    On the production front in the motherland, the slogans "The factory is the battlefield, the hammer is the weapon" and "Produce one more cart of coal, and you increase the strength to Resist America, Aid Korea by one point" resounded throughout every workshop and mine. More than 2.23 million workers across the country participated in patriotic labor competitions, and more than 19,000 groups responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang group. The working class in Northeast China responded to Comrade Gao Gang's call for increasing production and practicing economy. They planned to increase production and practice economy by 10.04 million tons of grain for the country by improving quality, reducing costs, tapping the potential of industry, and promoting advanced experiences. By late September, employees of 62 factories and mines had achieved an increase in production and savings of 1.62 million tons of grain. The value of the entire production increase and savings plan of Northeast China's workers can buy more than 4,300 fighter planes, which is three-quarters more than the planes donated by the people of the whole country in half a year. Almost all employees of state-owned and public-owned enterprises in Tianjin participated in patriotic labor competitions. Inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, the Tianjin Waterworks Company created 15 new records in August, reducing the unit cost of selling water at market prices by one-eighth compared to the original plan. Hao Jianxiu, a female worker at a Qingdao cotton mill, created advanced working methods, which have now been promoted in many factories. If all the fine yarn workers in the country reach Hao Jianxiu's working level, they will be able to increase production by more than 40,000 pieces of yarn for the country in one year. The cloth woven from these yarns would be enough to circle the Earth more than once. Li Junting of the Jiawang Coal Mine created a new record of 258 tons of coal mined per shift using pneumatic picks. This record has exceeded the second record created by the Soviet Stakhanov. 258 tons of coal, if supplied to a family that burns 20 catties of coal per day for household use, would be enough for 70 years. From these figures, we can know how much strength the Chinese working class has added to Resist America, Aid Korea and build the motherland!
    American imperialism once dreamed of strangling our country's young industry with "blockade" and "embargo." The Chinese working class, leading the people of the whole country, shattered this vicious plan of American imperialism with a doubled construction speed. Over the past year, many industrial products that could not be manufactured before are now labeled "Made in China." Workers have repeatedly told their compatriots across the country the proud good news: this year we can manufacture complete sets of textile machinery ourselves; we have manufactured automobiles ourselves; we have manufactured tractors ourselves; our machine workers have created more than 270 new products before June this year; the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the reactionary rulers clamored for 40 years but could not build, has been repaired for 274 kilometers in just over a year. We have full confidence in defeating imperialism and making our motherland industrialized.
    The Chinese working class has not only achieved victories on the production front, but they have also stood at the forefront of the people of the whole country in every patriotic political movement. Seventy-five percent of railway employees across the country have signed up to volunteer to aid Korea, and 80 percent of the railway workers who arrived in Korea have performed meritorious services for the people. Workers in Shanghai donated 50 fighter planes. Eighty-five percent of postal and telecommunications workers across the country signed patriotic covenants. Mass movements such as denouncing the crimes of imperialism, voting against the American armed Japan, signing in support of the five major powers concluding a peace treaty, participating in political study, and launching patriotic propaganda have been enthusiastically participated by workers everywhere. Many workers are constantly thinking of the Volunteer Army and using the heroic spirit of the Volunteer Army to inspire themselves. Steel workers in Tangshan braved temperatures of over 800 degrees to repair their "Resist America, Aid Korea" electric furnace. They said, "For the sake of the motherland and the people, the Volunteer Army is not afraid of death on the front lines in Korea, what are we afraid of."
    With the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the enthusiasm of workers across the country for caring about politics and demanding study has been unprecedentedly enhanced. 1.7 million workers across the country have participated in spare-time school studies; employees of many factories and enterprises have generally participated in reading groups. Many workers feel that "not reading the newspaper for a day is like losing something," and they completely regard national affairs as their own cause. In the great cause of defending the motherland and building the motherland, the working class of our country will continue to achieve more and greater achievements.

    全国工人阶级在抗美援朝运动中的伟大贡献
    雷平
    从朝鲜前线到祖国的每一处工厂、矿山，全国工人一年来为抗美援朝贡献了无比的力量。从志愿军出国作战开始，许多工人就穿上军服直接英勇地去抗击美国侵略者。营口市的火锯工人郑恩喜，在夜袭汉江南岸二圣山战斗中，曾奋身夺取敌人的四个机枪阵地，缴获四挺轻重机枪、一门火箭炮、一枝自动步枪和一枝卡宾枪，成为人民志愿军某部的特等功臣。在朝鲜的运输线上，英勇的铁路工人与汽车司机们战胜敌机的轰炸扫射，保证了前线部队的供给。他们在“沸流江”上凿开三尺多厚的冰块跳进水去抢修江桥。他们在铁道线上用双手抱走敌机投下的定时炸弹。不朽的英雄铁路工人王景洲，不惜以自己的身体塞住车轮来抢救出装满了武器弹药的火车。这些光辉的事迹，鼓舞了全国人民更加英勇地向美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。
    在祖国的生产战线上，“工厂当战场、铁锤当武器”、“多出一车煤，即增加一分抗美援朝力量”的口号响遍了各个工场与矿山。全国工人有二百二十三万以上参加了爱国主义的劳动竞赛，有一万九千多个小组向马恒昌小组应战。东北工人阶级响应了高岗同志关于增产节约的号召，他们以提高质量、降低成本、发挥工业潜在能力、推广先进经验等办法，计划为国家增产节约一千零四十万吨粮食。到九月下旬，六十二个厂矿的职工已获得了增产节约一百六十二万吨粮食的成绩。东北工人这一增产节约计划全部完成的价值，可以买四千三百多架战斗机，比全国人民半年中捐献的飞机还多四分之三。天津市国营、公营企业的职工几乎全部参加了爱国主义的劳动竞赛，在爱国热情的鼓舞下，天津市自来水公司在八月份创造了十五项新纪录，使市价售水的单位成本比原计划降低了八分之一。青岛的纱厂女工郝建秀，创造了先进的工作方法，现在已在许多工厂中推广。如果全国细纱工人都达到郝建秀的工作水平，一年内就能够为国家增产四万多件纱。这些纱织成布，足以围绕地球一周还多。贾汪煤矿的李君亭，创造了风镐采煤每班二百五十八吨的新纪录。这一纪录已超过了苏联斯塔哈诺夫所创造的第二次纪录。二百五十八吨煤，如果供给一个每天烧煤二十斤的家庭家用，足足可以用七十年。由这些数字，就可以知道中国工人阶级已为抗美援朝、建设祖国增添了多么大的力量！
    美帝国主义曾经梦想以“封锁”、“禁运”来扼杀我们祖国年轻的工业，中国工人阶级领导全国人民以超倍的建设速度粉碎了美帝国主义这一恶毒计划。一年以来，许多从前不能制造的工业品，现在都钉上
    “中国自制”的标签了。工人们连连不断地把值得骄傲的喜讯告诉全国同胞：今年我们自己能够制造整套的纺织机器；自己制造了汽车；自己制造了拖拉机；我们的机器工人今年六月以前就创制了二百七十多种新产品；反动统治时期嚷了四十年修不起来的成渝铁路，我们一年多就修好了二百七十四公里。我们完全有信心战胜帝国主义，并使我们的祖国走向工业化。
    中国工人阶级不仅在生产战线上取得了胜利，他们在每一项爱国的政治运动中都站在全国人民的最前列。全国铁路职工有百分之七十五报名要求志愿援朝，到了朝鲜的铁路工人百分之八十为人民立了功。上海市的工人捐献了五十架战斗机。全国邮电工人百分之八十五订立了爱国公约。控诉帝国主义的罪行、投票反对美国武装日本、签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约、参加政治学习、展开爱国宣传等等群众性的运动，各地工人无不热烈参加。许多工人时时刻刻在怀念着志愿军，用志愿军的英勇精神来激励自己。唐山的炼钢工人冒着八百多度的高温争着去修补自己的“抗美援朝号”电炉。他们说：“为了祖国，为了人民，志愿军在朝鲜前线连死都不怕，我们怕什么。”
    随着抗美援朝运动的普及与深入，全国工人关心政治、要求学习的情绪空前提高。全国有一百七十万工人参加了业余学校学习；许多工厂、企业的职工普遍参加了读报组。许多工人感到“一天不看报就像短了什么似的”，他们把国家大事完全看成了自己的事业。我国工人阶级在保卫祖国、建设祖国的伟大事业中，将不断地取得更多更大的成就。
