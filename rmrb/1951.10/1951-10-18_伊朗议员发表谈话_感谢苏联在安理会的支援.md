Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 16th: Iranian newspapers report that Iranian Majlis (parliament) member Ashtiani-Zadeh made a statement a few days ago regarding the British complaint being included on the Security Council agenda. He said, "I don't think there is a single person in Iran who is not indignant about the British government's case against the Iranian government." He said that this complaint is a blatant infringement of the sovereignty of the Iranian people.

He said, on the other hand, I believe the Iranian people will not forget the Soviet government's wise policy and friendly attitude. The Iranian people express their gratitude for the statement made by the Soviet representative to the Security Council in defending the rights of the Iranian people.

Senator Esfandiari also expressed his gratitude during a speech in the Senate on October 6th for the Soviet representative's opposition to the infringement of Iranian sovereignty by American and British imperialists.
