Brief Comment on Political and Legal Work

    Rely on the Masses to Do a Good Job of Procuratorial Work

    During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, people's procuratorates at all levels created many ways to connect with the masses, such as establishing procuratorial correspondents and setting up procuratorial mailboxes. These methods closely linked the people's procuratorial organs with the broad masses of people and organs, groups, and enterprises, and promoted the work. Most notably, the Southwest Branch Procuratorate developed 145 procuratorial correspondents in half a year. During this period, in addition to oral reports, it received 118 formal reports of procuratorial cases from various correspondents, including 45 related to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The Wobei District Woyang County Procuratorate in Anhui Province developed 15 procuratorial correspondents in agencies, organizations, and enterprises. In just two or three months, it received more than 100 reports from cultural and educational departments. After investigation, the materials reflected were all factual. According to the reports, 20 people have been arrested and brought to justice, 60 have been purged and transferred, and two who committed heinous crimes have been executed by shooting. During the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement, the 20 mailboxes of the Baoji Prefectural Procuratorate in the Northwest Region and its eight county procuratorates received 257 accusations. Because the procuratorial work closely relied on the masses, it played a considerable role in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the struggle against corruption and illegal activities, and procuratorial work was also carried out.

    On the contrary, some individual people's procuratorial organs do not have sufficient understanding of the mass line of relying on and mobilizing the masses, and do not pay attention to the accusations of the masses, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. For example, the Lingtai County Procuratorate in Gansu Province, although it also set up a procuratorial mailbox, did not handle the accusations submitted by the masses three times, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses and sealed the procuratorate's mailbox with mud. Although this is an isolated phenomenon, it is caused by serious detachment from the masses and deserves great attention. Procuratorates in various places should pay close attention to the accusations of the masses. Even if there are cases that cannot or should not be accepted, they must be clearly answered and the reasons explained. Any phenomenon or behavior that deviates from the masses is wrong. The procuratorial organs must rely on the broad masses to be their eyes and ears and carry out their work in order to do a good job.

    政法工作简评
    依靠群众作好检察工作
    在镇压反革命运动中，各级人民检察署曾创造了许多联系群众的办法，如建立检察通讯员，设立检察通讯箱等。这些办法都密切了人民检察机关与广大人民和机关、团体、企业部门间的联系，推进了工作。最显著的如西南分署，半年间共发展检察通讯员一百四十五名；在此期间，除口头汇报外，还接到各通讯员正式检察案件的报告一百一十八件，其中属于镇压反革命案件的共四十五起。皖北区涡阳县检察署在机关、团体、企业单位中发展了十五个检察通讯员，仅两三个月间从文教部门就收到检举报告百余件，经调查，所反映的材料均属事实。现已按照检举材料，将二十人逮捕归案，六十人清洗调动，罪大恶极的二人已执行枪决。西北区宝鸡专区检察署及其所属八个县检察署的二十个通讯箱，在镇压反革命运动期间就收到了二百五十七起控诉案。由于检察工作紧紧依靠了群众，因此，在镇压反革命运动及对贪污违法行为的斗争中都起了相当作用，检察业务也开展起来了。
    与此相反的，也有个别的人民检察机关，对于依靠群众、发动群众的群众路线认识不足，对群众的控诉不予重视，引起了群众的不满。如甘肃省灵台县检察署，虽也设置了检察通讯箱，但对群众三次投来的控诉状均未处理，致引起群众不满，将该署的通讯箱用泥糊封了。这虽然是极个别的现象，却是由于严重的脱离群众的不良作风所引起的，值得十分重视。各地检察署，对群众控诉均应切实注意，即有不能或不应受理的案件，也必须明白答复，说明理由。任何脱离群众的现象与行为，都是不对的，错误的。检察机关必须依靠广大群众为其耳目，开展业务，才能做好工作。
