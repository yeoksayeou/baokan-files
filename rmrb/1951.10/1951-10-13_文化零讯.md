Cultural Miscellany

    With the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, Chinese literary works have been loved by the broad masses of people abroad. In the past year, several English translations of Chinese literary works published by the Beijing Culture Publishing House, such as the reports of Premier Zhou, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Zhou Yang at the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Zhao Shuli's short story collection "The Rhymes of Li Youcai," Cao Ming's "The Driving Force," and Li Zhihua's "The Anti-Overturning Struggle," have been widely circulated abroad, especially in Australia, Britain, the United States, India, and Southeast Asian countries, where they have been welcomed by a wide readership. These works have also been translated into more than ten different languages. In order to meet the needs of foreign readers, the Culture Publishing House is now publishing an English-language "Chinese Literature" series, with the aim of systematically introducing modern Chinese literary works. The first collection was published on National Day, and includes Zhou Yang's "Resolutely Implement Mao Zedong's Line on Literature and Art," Kong Jue and Yuan Jing's "New Heroes and Heroines," Li Ji's "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," Liu Baiyu's "Six O'Clock in the Morning," Lu Qi's "The Furnace," Ding Ling's "Sent to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Units in Korea," and seven front-line dispatches from Korea by Wei Wei, Yang Shuo, Li Zhuang, and Chai Chuanruo. The entire book contains approximately 300,000 words, is 18mo in size, and comprises over 280 pages. It is distributed by the International Bookstore.
    The "1952 Xinhua Agricultural Yin-Yang Combined Calendar," compiled and written by the Beijing New Popular Publishing House, was published on September 25. The book introduces political, production, and hygiene knowledge suitable for farmers in the form of storytelling or ballads; the explanations are easy to understand and are accompanied by 150 to 160 illustrations. The book is currently being distributed by the China Book Company, with an initial distribution of 500,000 copies. Twenty-two booksellers in Beijing are also preparing to reprint it in large quantities to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers.
