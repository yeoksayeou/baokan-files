Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 29th: The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army solemnly held a celebration meeting on the anniversary of their departure for war. Attending the meeting were Commander Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander Deng Hua, Deputy Commander Chen Geng, Deputy Political Commissar Gan Siqi, Liu Xiangwen representing the Chinese Embassy in North Korea, representatives of combat heroes and people's meritorious workers, and more than 400 staff members of the headquarters. The delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Chairman Kim Tu-bong, also attended the meeting.

    The meeting began with the majestic national anthem of the People's Republic of China and the battle song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. First, Deputy Commander Deng Hua delivered the opening remarks, followed by speeches from Deputy Commander Chen Geng, Kim Chun-hae, representative of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Minister of Social Affairs of the Workers' Party, Li Hwan-ki, representative of the Korean People's Army, and Liu Xiangwen, representative of the Chinese Embassy in North Korea.

    In his speech, Deputy Commander Deng Hua first paid tribute to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, General Kim Il-sung, leader of the Korean people, and Chairman Kim Tu-bong, as well as the people of the motherland and the Korean people who are fully supporting the front, and all the commanders and fighters of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Volunteer Army. He also extended cordial greetings to the wounded and sick who were gloriously injured or overworked, and expressed deep condolences to the heroic martyrs. Deputy Commander Deng Hua then said: Over the past year, our People's Volunteer Army, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, has annihilated more than 380,000 invading troops, dealt a heavy blow to the arrogant enemy, shattered the American aggressors' criminal plan to destroy Korea and further invade the Chinese mainland, and laid the foundation for the final victory of the war against America. This victory, achieved by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with the full support of the people of both China and Korea and the assistance of peace-loving people all over the world, is of great historical significance. This victory will greatly contribute to the cause of defending peace in the East and the world.

    In his speech, Deputy Commander Chen Geng pointed out: The victory achieved by the Chinese and Korean people's armies in the anti-aggression war is great, but we must not forget that the aggressors have not yet learned the lesson of failure and are still frantically waging the war of aggression against Korea. Therefore, all our commanders and fighters must prepare for a protracted war, continue to carry forward the spirit of heroic tenacity and hard struggle, step up the study of modern military science, further unite the Korean army and people, and fight to the end to continuously annihilate the enemy and finally defeat the aggressors.

    In his speech, Kim Chun-hae, representative of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Minister of Social Affairs of the Workers' Party, first expressed his heartfelt gratitude and high respect to all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on behalf of the Korean people. He said: In October last year, when our motherland was in the most serious situation, the Chinese people, under the banner of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country, organized the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and sent it to the Korean battlefield, and at the same time launched a nationwide movement to resist America and aid Korea. For a year, the Chinese and Korean people's armies have fought side by side, causing the American aggressors to suffer a shameful defeat. The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have displayed indomitable perseverance, fortitude, and unparalleled bravery in arduous battles, and have cultivated many combat heroes and combat models. They have fully demonstrated the spirit of internationalism and have helped the Korean people like brothers, and therefore they are deeply respected and loved by the Korean people. The great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will forever shine brightly in the history of our motherland. Minister Kim Chun-hae pointed out: If the armed aggressors who have already suffered serious blows do not abandon their policy of aggression against our motherland and Asia, they will surely suffer even greater defeats. We must strengthen the friendship and unity with the great Chinese people, and overcome all difficulties to actively support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army to ensure our victory in battle.

    The meeting was held in an atmosphere full of confidence in victory and excitement and joy. At the close of the meeting, the whole audience enthusiastically shouted: "Long live the victory of the Chinese and Korean people!" "Long live the consolidated friendship between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army!" After the meeting, the Korean People's Army General Political Bureau Performing Arts Troupe and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Political Department Cultural Troupe performed wonderful programs such as dance, singing, and opera.

    陈赓副司令员在致词中指出：中朝人民军队在反侵略战争中所取得的胜利是伟大的，但是，我们不要忘记侵略者还未接受失败的教训，仍然在疯狂地进行侵朝战争。因而，我全体指战员必须准备持久作战，继续发扬英勇顽强艰苦奋斗的精神，加紧学习现代化的军事科学，进一步地团结朝鲜军民，为不断地歼灭敌人和最后战胜侵略者而奋斗到底。
