Introduction to the Inter-Regional Pavilion of the North China Regional Rural and Urban Materials Exchange Exhibition
　　By our special correspondent Jia Huo
　　Everyone who visited the inter-regional pavilion of the North China Regional Rural and Urban Materials Exchange Exhibition said: Our motherland is truly great and truly abundant!
　　The inter-regional pavilion concentrates on the main industrial and agricultural products of the five major administrative regions: East China, Northeast China, Central South China, Northwest China, and Southwest China. In the inter-regional pavilion, we see heavy industrial products necessary for national defense and production development, light industrial products for military and civilian use, and various agricultural products and native and special products. The exhibits here show the richness of our great motherland, the infinite wisdom of the working people of our great motherland, and the bright future of our great motherland. "Vast land and abundant resources"
　　Entering the inter-regional pavilion, you can first see the industrial and agricultural products of the Northeast, the industrial base of our country: coal produced by the world-famous Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine; various oils and by-products refined from oil shale - gasoline, diesel, kerosene, wax and sulfur? . There are also various types of steel. Since liberation, the development of industrial production in the Northeast has been very rapid. Taking cement production as an example: the cement output of the Northeast region accounts for 49.19% of the national cement output; taking 1946 as the base period, the output in 1947 was three times that of 1946, five times in 1948, thirteen times in 1949, twenty-five times in 1950, and even thirty-three times in 1951. The agricultural and forestry products of the Northeast also occupy an important position in our country. In the inter-regional pavilion, various types of wood produced in the Northeast are displayed: poplar, oak, elm, basswood, birch, white cow tree, amur cork, walnut, and various fir trees. Corn, sorghum, and soybeans produced in the Northeast also attract people's attention. Soybeans are a specialty of the Northeast. The soybean production in the Northeast region accounts for 56.81% of the world's total output. Soybeans can be used to make soap, food, fuel, feed, fertilizer, paint, artificial petroleum, lamp oil, lubricating oil, alcohol, formaldehyde and other 39 kinds of products. It is not only a daily necessity for food, but also an indispensable material for industrial production and national defense construction. Since liberation, the Northeast People's Government has called on farmers to produce large quantities of commercial grain, and agriculture in the Northeast is developing rapidly.
　　The highest grain yield per hectare in Northeast China in 1943 was 2,270 jin, and the yield per hectare reached 2,412 jin in 1950. The inter-regional pavilion also displays famous specialties of the Northeast: pilos antler, ginseng, and various furs such as gray squirrel, muskrat skin, dog skin, yuan skin, and rabbit skin.
　　East China is the center of light industry production in our country. The inter-regional pavilion displays nationally famous silk fabrics from Suzhou and Hangzhou, various colored cloths, printed cloths, silks, woolens, and the rich light industrial products of Shanghai. In addition, it also displays self-made diesel engines, lathes, hosiery machines and other machines from the East China region. The tea in East China is very eye-catching. The inter-regional pavilion focuses on introducing the production and manufacturing process of tea. Qimen black tea, Tunxi green tea, oolong tea, Suzhou scented tea, etc. in East China are all famous teas at home and abroad; but before liberation, under the devastation of reactionary rule, tea production sharply decreased. After liberation, the People's Government rewarded tea production and adjusted tea prices, so that producers could obtain reasonable profits, and tea production gradually increased. In 1950, tea production in East China doubled compared with 1949.
　　The exhibits in the Central South region systematically introduce the production, transportation, and sales of local and special products in the Central South region. The ramie production in the Central South region accounts for 80% of the national output, and tung oil accounts for 55% of the national output. The ramie products exhibited in the inter-regional pavilion - Liuyang summer cloth, Guangdong's Xiangyun yarn, and Henan's Erliu silk, all attracted the attention of the audience. In addition, there are tea, medicinal materials, as well as the nationally famous porcelain and carved porcelain from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, and local and special products and handicrafts such as Hunan's Xiang embroidery and drawnwork.
　　The exhibits in the Southwest region are mainly minerals and native products, including the world-famous tin, copper, iron, zinc, lead, mercury, earth saltpeter, and agricultural and pastoral products such as hemp, gallnut, coir rope, and hides. Coir rope is a specialty of the Southwest, and its tensile strength is greater than that of hemp rope. The Southwest region has successfully tested the use of gallnut to manufacture plastics. In the past, most of the plastics used in our country relied on imports from foreign countries. Now, we can manufacture them ourselves with domestic raw materials, which can eliminate a lot of waste.
　　The Northwest region exhibited valuable medicines such as antelope horn and musk, and bulk medicines such as rhubarb and angelica. The handmade cotton textiles in the Northwest region have developed rapidly in recent years, and the canvas produced is of good quality. According to recent tests, the soil and climate in Xinjiang are extremely suitable for growing cotton, and the future development prospects are limitless. The most eye-catching exhibit in the Northwest region is the oil and its by-products from the Yumen Oil Mine. The Yumen mine has abundant reserves and excellent oil quality. Soon, with the development of transportation, all problems can be easily solved. All of this powerfully tells the audience: the Northwest, which is being developed, truly has a boundless future.
　　Handicrafts facing workers and peasants
　　Before liberation, many of our country's world-renowned handicrafts were suppressed by the reactionary ruling class and had no opportunity for development at all. Handicrafts became ornaments for a small number of reactionary ruling classes, and the fruits of the working people's creation could not be enjoyed by themselves. After liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, handicrafts moved towards the correct direction of facing workers and peasants. This is a fundamental change in handicraft production. In the inter-regional pavilion, we see various statues of great people painted on the world-famous Jingdezhen porcelain, including photos of Chairman Mao from his youth, photos of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and pictures of the unity of peace forces. Carved porcelain also sculpts statues of Chairman Mao and Stalin. In the past, the main paintings of the nationally famous Xiang embroidery were landscape paintings, portraits of beauties, and legends of chivalry, etc. Now, most of the paintings are women turning over to engage in production, labor glory, the people's armed forces are the defenders of peace, improving agricultural and forestry production, and other content with propaganda and educational significance. The drawnwork in Central South China now mainly manufactures tablecloths and placemats, etc., which are suitable for workers and peasants to use. Facing workers and peasants is the direction that handicrafts and all production should strive for. In the past, under the exploitation of the reactionary ruling class, the working people had no money to buy these noble decorations and luxury goods. Now, the production direction of handicrafts has changed, and the people's purchasing power is gradually increasing, and the development prospects of handicrafts are limitless.
　　Smashing the enemy's conspiracy
　　Since last autumn, the imperialist group headed by the United States has used various methods to "blockade" us, attempting to undermine our economic construction; but the history of the past year has proved that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Chinese people can overcome any difficulties. Over the past year, we have relied on the hard work and creativity of the Chinese working class, the expansion and deepening of rural and urban material exchanges, and the mutual exchange and assistance of our friendly Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, and have overcome many difficulties and smashed the imperialist blockade conspiracy. Now, it is not us who are suffering difficulties, but those imperialist countries that want to undermine our economic construction. In the exhibits in the inter-regional pavilion, we see various machines made by East China itself. Our self-made "universal dual-purpose grinder" has a precision rate of 0.002 cm, exceeding international standards. Now, we can make our own screen silk. Screen silk is mainly used for grinding wheat flour, and it is indispensable for the flour milling industry in cities and rural areas. In the past, we transported raw silk to foreign countries, processed it, and then transported it back, suffering huge losses in the process; now we can use our own raw materials to make finished products ourselves, the quality is better than imported goods, and the cost is cheaper than imported goods. Our country's special products such as soybeans, bristles, and tung oil are all very important materials. The tung oil produced in our country accounts for 95% of the world's output; tung oil is not only a general coating, but it is also closely related to national defense construction. In the past, about 70% of our country's tung oil was exported to imperialist countries, and now most of it is exported to the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. Our country's soybeans, bristles, and tea have also changed the direction of export and developed trade with the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. Over the past year, under the leadership of the People's Government, rural and urban material exchanges have been vigorously developed. Now, from Hainan Island in the south to Manchuria in the north, domestic materials can be smoothly exchanged everywhere. In this way, we have completely shattered the imperialists' conspiracy. Let us cheer for the beautiful prospects of our great motherland, and let us advance forever victoriously under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government.

    华北区城乡物资交流展览会区际馆介绍
    本报特约记者  贾火
    参观了华北区城乡物资交流展览会的区际馆，每一个人都说：我们的祖国真是伟大，真是丰饶！
    区际馆集中了华东、东北、中南、西北、西南等五大行政区的主要工农业产品。在区际馆中，我们看到建设国防、发展生产必需的重工业产品，供给军需民用的轻工业产品和各种农产品与土产、特产品。这里的展品，显示了我们伟大祖国蕴藏的丰富，显示了我们伟大祖国的劳动人民的无穷智慧，显示了我们伟大祖国的光明。“地大物博”
    进入区际馆，首先可以看到我国工业基地东北的工农业产品：闻名世界的抚顺露天煤矿生产的煤；用油母页岩制炼的各种油类及其副产品——汽油、柴油、煤油、腊和硫?。还有各种各样的钢材。解放后，东北区工业生产的发展是很迅速的。以水泥的生产为例：东北区的水泥产量占全国水泥产量的百分之四十九点一九；东北水泥产量，如以一九四六年为基期，一九四七年产量为一九四六年的三倍，一九四八年增至五倍，一九四九年增至十三倍，一九五○年增至二十五倍，一九五一年更增至三十三倍。东北的农林产品，在我国也占着重要的地位。区际馆中，陈列着东北出产的各种木材：青杨、柞木、榆木、椴木、白桦、白牛子、黄波罗、胡桃楸及各种杉木。东北生产的玉米、高粱、大豆，也引起人们的注意。大豆是东北的特产。东北区大豆的产量，占世界总产量的百分之五十六点八一。大豆可以做肥皂、食料、燃料、饲料、肥料、涂料、人造石油、灯油、润滑油、酒精、甲醛等三十九种产品，不仅是日用必需的食物，也是工业生产、国防建设不能缺少的物资。解放后，东北人民政府号召农民，大量生产商品粮，东北的农业正迅速发展着。
    一九四三年东北每垧地最高产粮二二七○斤，一九五○年每垧地的产量达到二四一二斤。区际馆内，还陈列着东北著名的特产：鹿茸、人参和灰鼠、香鼠皮、狗皮、元皮、兔皮等各种皮张。
    华东区是我国轻工业生产的中心。区际馆内陈列着全国驰名的苏州杭州的丝织品，各种色布、花布、绸缎、呢绒以及上海的丰富的轻工业产品。此外，还陈列着华东区自制的柴油机、车床、织袜机等机器。华东区的茶非常引人注意，区际馆着重介绍了茶的生产情况和制造过程。华东区的祁门红茶、屯溪绿茶、乌龙茶、苏州花茶等都是驰名中外的名茶；但在解放前，在反动统治的摧残下，茶叶产量锐减，解放后，人民政府奖励产茶，调整了茶价，使生产者得到合理的利润，茶的产量逐渐增加，一九五○年，华东区茶叶产量比一九四九年增加了一倍。
    中南区的展品，系统地介绍了中南区土产特产的生产和运销情况，中南区的苧麻产量，占全国产量的百分之八十，桐油占全国产量百分之五十五，在区际馆中展出的苧麻制品——浏阳夏布、广东的香云纱、河南的二六绸，都引起观众的注意。此外，尚有茶叶、药材，以及全国闻名的江西景德镇的磁器和雕瓷，湖南的湘绣、抽纱等土产特产品与手工艺品。
    西南区的展品以矿产和土产为主，有全世界闻名的锡、铜、铁、锌、铅、汞、土硝，及农牧产品麻、五倍子、棕绳、皮张等。棕绳是西南特产，其拉力较麻绳为大。用五倍子制造塑料，西南区已试验成功。过去我国所用塑料，多靠从国外进口，现在以国产原料自制，可杜绝很大漏扈。
    西北区展览了贵重药品如羚角、麝香，大宗药品如大黄、当归等。西北区手工棉织品，近年发展很快，所产帆布，质量很好。据最近试验，新疆土质，气候极宜种棉，将来发展前途是不可限量的。西北区展品最引人注意的是玉门油矿的油类及其副产品。玉门矿藏量甚丰，油质极好，不久交通发展了，一切问题可迎刃而解。凡此一切，都有力地告诉观众：正在开发的大西北，真是前途无量。
    手工艺品面向工农
    解放前，我国许多闻名世界的手工艺品，被反动统治阶级所压迫，完全没有发展的机会，手工艺品成为少数反动统治阶级的饰物，劳动人民创造的果实，自己却不能享受。解放后，在人民政府的领导下，手工艺品走向面向工农的正确方向，这是手工艺生产上一个带有根本性质的转变。在区际馆中，我们看到世界著名的景德镇磁器上绘塑的各种伟人像，其中有毛主席从少年开始时的像片，有朱总司令的像片，及和平力量团结起来等画片。雕瓷也雕塑了毛主席和斯大林的立像。全国闻名的湘绣，过去，主要的画幅是风景画片、美人像、风尘三侠等，现在的画幅大部分已经是妇女翻身搞生产、劳动光荣、人民武装是和平的保卫者、改进农林生产等富有宣传教育意义的内容了。中南的抽纱，现在主要制造桌布、垫布等，这是适合工农使用的，面向工农是手工艺品和一切生产应该努力的方向。过去在反动统治阶级的压榨之下，劳动人民没有钱来购买这些高贵的装饰品和奢侈品，今后手工艺品的生产方向改变了，人民的购买力在逐渐提高，手工艺品的发展前途是无可限量的。
    粉碎敌人的阴谋
    去秋以来，以美国为首的帝国主义集团用各种方法来“封锁”我们，企图破坏我们的经济建设；但一年来的历史证明，在共产党和人民政府领导下，中国人民能够克服任何困难。一年来，我们依靠了中国工人阶级的辛勤劳动与创造，依靠了城乡物资交流的扩展和深入，依靠了我们友谊深厚的苏联及新民主主义国家互通有无、互相帮助，已经克服许多困难，粉碎了帝国主义的封锁阴谋。现在遭受困难的不是我们，而是那些想破坏我们经济建设的帝国主义国家。在区际馆的展品中，我们看到华东自制的各种机器。我们自造的“万能两用磨床”，精确率在○·○○二公分，超过国际水准。现在，我们已能自制筛绢了。筛绢主要用于磨麦粉的罗底，是城市和农村的磨粉工业不可缺少的东西。过去我们是把生丝运往国外，加工后再运回来，转手之间，吃亏极大；现在我们可以用自己的原料，自制成品，质量比进口货好，成本比进口货便宜。我国的特产大豆、猪鬃、桐油等，都是非常重要的物资，我国出产的桐油，占全世界产量的百分之九十五；桐油不仅是一般的涂料，它和国防建设也有很密切的关系。过去，我国桐油百分之七十左右是输往帝国主义国家，现在大部分输往苏联和新民主主义国家。我国的大豆、猪鬃、茶叶，也都改变了输出的方向，开展了对苏联及新民主主义国家的贸易。一年来，在人民政府领导下，大力展开了城乡物资交流，现在南到海南岛，北到满洲里，国内的物资到处可以顺畅交流。这样，我们就把帝国主义者的阴谋彻底粉碎了。让我们为我们伟大祖国的美丽远景而欢呼，让我们在毛主席和人民政府领导下永远胜利前进。
