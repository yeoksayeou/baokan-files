    Stalin's talk on atomic weapons purged my remaining fear-of-America thoughts
    Editor:
    The glorious victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield have basically eliminated my fear-of-America thoughts. However, when I think of the United States possessing a large number of atomic bombs, I still cannot help but feel some fear. Comrade Stalin's talk made me believe that if the aggressors dare to launch a new war, we will certainly have enough weapons to deal with them. This has purged the last bit of my remaining fear-of-America thoughts. Comrade Stalin's talk severely attacked the American warmongers and completely bankrupted their atomic blackmail. At the same time, Stalin reiterated that the Soviet Union firmly advocates genuine international control of atomic weapons and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, which is also good news for billions of peace-loving people around the world.

    Editor:
    Since the American atomic bombs massacred many Japanese people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I have long been held captive by it ideologically. After studying, although I also understood that this was influenced by the exaggerated propaganda of the American imperialists, I still retained some fear of this atomic weapon that massacres human beings. When I read Stalin's talk on the 7th morning, I was so excited and agitated that I felt as happy as if I had been liberated ideologically. This is the direct educational effect of Stalin's talk on me.
    At the same time, I also realized the upright and pragmatic attitude of the peace camp. This is vividly expressed in every word of Stalin's talk. This talk exposed the despicable and shameless, and fraudulent ugliness of the aggressive bloc without reservation. This comparison has given me a further understanding of the essence of socialism and imperialism; and I am even clearer about the reasons why American imperialism has repeatedly delayed and deliberately sabotaged the Korean armistice negotiations.
    I feel a deep hatred for American atomic warmongers. I must work hard to produce and take practical actions to follow the path of peace pointed out by Stalin.  Jin Yan

### 斯大林关于原子武器的谈话肃清了我残存的恐美思想

    斯大林关于原子武器的谈话肃清了我残存的恐美思想编辑同志：
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上的辉煌胜利，基本上消除了我的恐美思想。但是当我想到美国握有大量原子弹时，依然不免有些恐惧心理。斯大林同志的这次谈话使我相信：如果侵略者敢于发动新的大战，我们一定能有足够的武器来对付他们。这一下把我残存的一点恐美思想都肃清了。斯大林同志这篇谈话严重地打击了美国战争贩子，使他们的原子讹诈完全破产；同时斯大林再度表示苏联坚决主张对原子武器实行真正的国际管制，把原子能用于和平事业，这也是全世界所有爱好和平的亿万人民的福音。
    清华大学外文系教授  杨业治编辑同志：
    自从美国的原子弹屠杀了日本广岛、长崎两市很多日本人民以后，我长期地在思想上作了它的俘虏。经过学习，虽然也明白了这是受了美帝国主义者夸大宣传的影响，但对这大规模屠杀人类的原子武器，总还多少保留着一些恐惧的心理。七日早晨我读了斯大林的谈话，兴奋和激动得了不得，感到思想上像获得了解放一样的愉快。这是斯大林谈话对我所起的直接的教育作用。
    同时，我也体会到和平阵营的正大光明与实事求是的态度。这从斯大林的谈话中一字一句地生动地表现了出来。这个谈话把侵略集团的卑鄙无耻与讹骗欺诈的丑态揭露无遗。这一对比，使我对社会主义和帝国主义两者的本质，又有了进一步的认识；对美帝国主义为什么一再拖延和蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判的原因也就更加清楚了。
    我对美国原子黩武主义者感到切齿的痛恨。我一定要努力生产，以实际行动遵循着斯大林所指示的和平道路前进。  巾言
