    On the March to Lhasa
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Guo Xinke
    The most arduous part of the Kangzang (Sichuan-Tibet) Road is the stretch from Bianba to Taizhao. This section requires crossing four mountains over 6,000 meters high: Between Bianba and Jiali are the Dongdanda Mountain (Tibetan name Xiegongla, meaning East Snow Mountain) and Xidanda Mountain (Tibetan name Lugongla, meaning West Snow Mountain), the former being 6,300 meters high and the latter 6,100 meters high. Between Jiali and Taizhao lie the Mendala Mountain and Cuola Mountain, both over 6,000 meters high. Between these four snow-capped mountains are plateaus over 5,000 meters above sea level. The climate is cold, the air is thin, there are few inhabitants, and crops and trees are scarce. People are out of breath with the slightest exertion. When the advance troops of the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, they heroically overcame these difficulties and created unprecedented miracles. The Dongdanda Mountain, west of Bianba, has always been known as the "most dangerous natural barrier on the Kangzang Road." Along the mountain road, which stretches for fifty li, stand three peaks towering into the clouds. Although the scorching sun on the plateau in August and September has melted the snow on the mountain road, the surrounding peaks are still covered with thick layers of snow, dazzlingly bright. When climbing the mountain, the Tibetan transport team, which volunteered to work with the army, followed Tibetan customs by inserting paper flags on the livestock and chanting scriptures to pray for safe passage. The People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters fought the treacherous mountains and steep slopes by moving at a slower pace and taking more frequent short rests. Even the young art troupe members, aged fifteen or sixteen, joined the march with their ten-odd-jin backpacks. Nearing the third mountain peak, the art troupe members sang encouraging rhythmic verses, blew trumpets, and danced the Red Army Dance while climbing, encouraging the soldiers to advance more resolutely.
    When the troops passed through the Dongdanda Mountain in neat formation and reached the bottom of the mountain, many soldiers said happily: "When we started the march last year, we felt dizzy when we crossed mountains over 3,000 meters high; now we can cross mountains over 6,000 meters high without feeling dizzy." After more than a year of training in high-altitude living, the commanders and fighters crossed the Dongdanda Mountain and then crossed the Xidanda Mountain, Mendala Mountain, and Cuola Mountain. The soldiers loudly proclaimed the slogan "Carry forward the spirit of the Red Army crossing the snowy mountains and grasslands." The cultural officers and cultural instructors of the troops all rushed to the mountain tops to beat gongs and drums, and did encouragement work for the troops. The commanders and fighters also fully promoted the spirit of mutual assistance. Deputy Company Commander Xue Jinzhong constantly helped the soldiers carry submachine guns and rifles. Many soldiers who were walking in front climbed to the top of Xidanda Mountain and then went back down to meet their comrades and help them up the mountain. The Tibetans greatly admired the People's Liberation Army's heroic and tenacious spirit in overcoming difficulties. They said, "We don't dare to speak loudly when we climb Lugongla Mountain; but the People's Liberation Army beat gongs and drums, ran around, and crossed it happily." Before crossing Cuola Mountain, it started to snow on the mountain, and the point men cleared the way for the troops in the snow. The snowy peaks, which were six or seven li up and down, were quickly left behind by the soldiers. The People's Liberation Army marched through this vast, cold region of five or six hundred li lacking trees and firewood, and encountered five or six consecutive days of overcast and rainy weather. The commanders and fighters were often wet, and sometimes the campsite was only two or three hundred meters away from the snow-capped mountains, making the nights especially cold. The local Tibetan people had already transported firewood for the People's Liberation Army, providing warmth to their own troops. Two Tibetan households with many caves under Xidanda Mountain and six Tibetan households in Jiagong'ai organized thirty-two men, women, and children to transport firewood from eighty li away before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. Aja Wangda and others, Tibetans from Caquka east of Jiali, drove yaks to the mountains twelve days ago to prepare firewood for the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army received sufficient firewood at every post, so the soldiers were able to keep warm and maintain sufficient energy and physical strength in the overcast and rainy weather.
    The advance troops of the People's Liberation Army in Tibet, with their heroic and tenacious fighting spirit and with the enthusiastic support of the Tibetan people, overcame various difficulties and successfully passed through the vast, cold region.

    向拉萨进军途中
    新华社记者  郭辛可
    康藏道上最艰难的行程要算从边坝到太昭的一段。这中间要翻越四座六千公尺以上的高山：在边坝与嘉黎之间的是东丹达山（藏名斜贡拉，意为东雪山）与西丹达山（藏名鲁贡拉，意为西雪山），前者高六千三百公尺，后者高六千一百公尺；嘉黎与太昭之间则横亘着六千余公尺高的门达拉山与错拉山。在这四座雪山之间是一片片拔海五千公尺以上的高地，气候寒冷，空气稀薄，人烟稀少，罕有庄稼与树林，人们稍作行动就会喘息不已。人民解放军入藏部队的先遣部队通过这一地区时，英勇地克服了这些困难，创造出从来未有的奇迹。边霸以西的东丹达山历来都被称作“康藏道上第一天险”，在上下五十里的山道旁，耸立着高插入云的三个山峰。八、九月间高原上的烈日虽然已使山道上的积雪溶化了，但道旁的群峰却仍裹着厚厚的雪层，光耀夺目。登山时，自愿随军工作的藏民运输队，按照藏俗在牲口上插起纸旗，念着经文，为平安过山而祈祷；而解放军指挥员和战斗员则以较缓慢的速率和多作小休息的办法与险山陡坡搏斗。十五、六岁的小文工队员也背着自己十来斤重的背包，加入了进军的行列。快到第三个山头了，文工队的队员们唱着鼓动快板，吹着喇叭，一边攀登，一边跳起红军舞来，鼓励战士们更加顽强地向前行进。
    当部队以整齐的队形通过了东丹达山下到了山底时，许多战士都高兴地说：“去年开始进军时，过三千多公尺高的山就头晕啦；现在过六千公尺的高山，头也不晕就过来了。”经过一年多高原生活锻炼的指挥员和战斗员，通过了东丹达山后，又越过了西丹达山、门达拉山和错拉山。战士们都响亮地提出了“发扬红军过雪山草地的精神”的口号。部队的文化干事和文化教员们都争先爬上山头，打起锣鼓，向部队作鼓动工作。指挥员和战斗员们并充分发扬了互助精神。副连长薛进中不断地帮助战士背冲锋枪、步枪。许多走在前面的战士爬上西丹达山头后，又下去接后边的同志上山。藏民们都非常钦佩解放军克服困难的英勇顽强精神，他们说：“我们上鲁贡拉山不敢大声说话；但是，解放军却敲鼓打锣，跑来跑去，欢天喜地地过来了。”过错拉山之前，山上下起雪来了，尖兵就在积雪中为部队开路，上下六七里的雪峰迅速地就被丢在战士们的背后。解放军踏过这一绵亘五、六百里缺少树木、柴草的高寒地区，又碰上接连五、六天的阴雨，指挥员和战斗员们身上经常是湿的，有时宿营地距离积雪的山头只有二、三百公尺，夜晚分外的寒冷。当地的藏族人民早已给解放军运来了柴草，供给自己的队伍取暖。西丹达山下多洞的二户藏民和甲贡皑的六户藏民，在解放军到来之前就组织了男女老少三十二人到八十里外去运柴草，嘉黎东面擦曲卡的藏民阿贾汪达等人十二天前就赶着牦牛到高山上去为解放军准备木柴。解放军在每一个驿站上都得到了充分的柴草，因此，战士们在阴雨中能够烤火御寒，保持了充分的精力和体力。
    人民解放军入藏部队的先遣部队以英勇顽强的战斗精神，在藏族人民的热情支援下，克服了各种困难，顺利通过了辽阔的高寒地区。
