    Farmers Request Publishing Industry to Compile Popular Dictionary
    To the Editorial Comrades:
    We now have newspapers in every village, which makes us farmer brothers very happy. The newspapers contain much news and knowledge, such as the international situation, the policies of the People's Government, local production experiences, and the donation situations in various places to increase production, etc., which are of great help and inspiration to us. We can also make suggestions and requests to the People's Government through the newspapers. In the past, under the Kuomintang reactionary government, could we speak to the newspapers? Now, the "Ningbo Masses" we read uses simple sentences that are very suitable for our taste. However, there are still a few characters we don't recognize. Although we can ask the teacher, it's a bit inconvenient. Now, we farmers are requesting the publishing industry to compile a popular farmers' dictionary. This dictionary should be very simple and not like the old dictionaries, using some kind of phonetic spelling with explanations that are not easy to understand, which we cannot understand. If we have this kind of dictionary, then we won't have to worry about reading the newspaper.
    Farmers Chen Guorui, He Yi Township, Jiangshan District, Ningbo, Zhejiang

### 农民要求出版界编通俗字典

专栏：读者来信

    农民要求出版界编通俗字典编辑同志：
    我们现在每村都有报纸了，我们农民兄弟都很欢喜。报纸上有许多消息和知识，如国际形势，人民政府政策，各地生产经验，各地增产捐献的情况等等，对我们都有很大的帮助和启发。我们还可以通过报纸向人民政府提出建议和要求。在过去国民党反动政府时，我们能向报纸说话吗？现在我们读的“宁波大众”，句子通俗，很适合我们的胃口。但其中还有少数不认识的字，虽可去问老师，不过有些不便当。现在我们农民兄弟要求出版界编一部通俗的农民字典。这部字典要很浅，不要像过去的字典，用什么切音，解释又不通俗，那是我们看不懂的。我们若有了这种字典，那么看报就不愁了。
    浙江宁波姜山区和益乡农民  陈国瑞
