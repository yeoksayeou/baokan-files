Editor's Note: The performances of the Chinese Youth Delegation's Art Troupe at the 3rd World Youth and Student Peace Festival in Berlin were warmly welcomed by young people from all countries. Many reviews and introductions were published in German newspapers. We have selected two articles, one by Professor Magritz published in the "Daily Review" on August 14th, and the other by Professor Meyer published in the "Neues Deutschland" on August 15th, to illustrate the international friends' love and appreciation of the new Chinese art.

New China Speaks to the World's Youth
Professor Magritz of Germany

The Chinese artistic program is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant artistic achievements of the festival evening. This can be explained by the fact that the great Chinese nation, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong, has been liberated from imperialist exploitation and oppression through victorious revolutionary struggles, and has achieved great economic successes, laying a material foundation for the development of Chinese people's art.

Chinese artists know how to innovate their great national traditions, vigorously enrich its content and form, and raise it to a higher stage. This performance is the best proof of China's great cultural revolution. This is also the reason why the audience gave enthusiastic praise and frantic applause after each performance.

The characteristics of Chinese traditional art can be most clearly seen in solo singing, instrumental music, and classical opera (referring to the Peking Opera "San Cha Kou" - translator). Classical opera as an art form is seen for the first time in Germany. (The synopsis of the "San Cha Kou" story is omitted here - translator) This heroic history of the people is narrated with very few words. In Germany, we have never seen such a dance drama rich in performance techniques, such an ideal musical accompaniment, which makes us feel particularly moved.

This classical opera gives us a deep impression of the popular face of Chinese art. At the same time, the dances performed by Chinese artists more profoundly express the strong national color in the people's art.

The Red Silk Dance was greeted with frantic cheers. When we saw Chinese modeling art, we were all amazed at their skillful mastery of artistic means and their highly proficient manual skills. Now we have seen the agile figures and various ingenious shapes formed by the red silk in the brightly colored group dance. This is really the best viewing opportunity.

The moonlit dance, full of profound and subtle poetry, is a beautiful and delightful dance. Young villagers gather with their instruments on a bright moonlit night, and the girls intersperse among them, dancing to expressive music. Another mime-like butterfly dance is a folk dance full of childlike joy. In this dance, the joyful feelings of the Chinese people are highly artistic.

Another characteristic of Chinese performing arts is humor. This can be seen not only in expressive dances, but also especially in various amazing acrobatic performances; not only in physical performances that are almost unbelievable, but also especially in the unexpected expressions of young acrobats. These all aroused constant cheers and applause from the audience.

In solo singing and instrumental performances, although the Chinese pentatonic scale feels unfamiliar to us, its expressive power, that is, the touching power of music, is very strong. The singer who sang "My Old Man" used a very good bass voice to sing the mood of an old man after having his own house and land since liberation, movingly expressing the Chinese people's respect and gratitude to their great leader Mao Zedong.

This song shows that the old singing music has achieved new success through expressive scores and sonorous harmonies. This new form, which has emerged in Chinese people's life and art, is more powerfully expressed in the grand chorus that begins and ends the evening.

These two grand choruses demonstrate the infinite power of Chinese people's art. "The Yellow River Cantata" elevates this majestic Chinese river into a symbol of high national significance. This is a song of praise for the Chinese people's love of peace and their motherland. This emotionally rich chorus has a rich tone and strong dramatic meaning, and the interspersion of solo singing enriches the content.

This delightful evening is a testament to the creative power of the Chinese people and their highly developed culture and great national traditions. These artistic profound feelings strengthen the Chinese people's hatred of American robbers and illustrate the brilliant development of New China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong.

The representatives from various countries present thanked the Chinese friends for giving them such an extraordinary gift, and returned it with continuous applause. This evening can be regarded as a particularly brilliant and beautiful link in the chain of artistic performances used by various countries to express friendship. (Translated by Wang Yunfeng)

The Premiere of the Chinese Opera "The White Haired Girl" in Berlin is a Major Event
Professor Meyer, Winner of the German National Medal

The opera "The White Haired Girl" was performed twice at the Berlin Comedy Theater on August 11th, and it was a moving experience for all the audience. This "new type of opera," as the program calls it, is a collective creation of Chinese poets and playwrights. Here we see an important innovation in opera creation. Its directing and stage design work are not done by one person, but by the cooperation of many artists. (The following is a summary of the plot, omitted - translator) The power of the story itself and its realism are further strengthened by the structure of opera art.

This is not an opera with European traditional meaning. Singing is not the main purpose of the play. Unlike many Western European operas, music is only used to enhance the performance effect, describe emotions, and wherever words and sets cannot be completely expressed. In this opera, singing strengthens the climaxes and transitions in the plot. It expresses touching scenes, and the music is not continuous throughout the play. Sometimes only dialogue is used in very long stages, and sometimes only narration, only speaking but not singing, accompanied by the orchestra.

Its music is often moving, whether in lyrical or performance aspects, whether in expressing despair or the greatest excitement. At the same time, this music is the most popular, and anyone can understand it immediately. Every audience member's emotions can easily change with the development of the music. In the play, we constantly hear the tunes of Chinese folk songs. Because this opera is created for thousands of Chinese people, not only for a few connoisseurs, as is often the case in the German opera scene. It is to write about the people's struggle, not about atypical things, nor about things that are only loved by non-productive people in society, but to perform art that is needed by the working masses.

The orchestra is composed of Chinese and European instruments. The singing follows the pure Chinese traditional format. The form and style of the score sometimes have a bit of European flavor, which can be seen in the use of some European scales in harmony, but what a Chinese audience told me during the break is absolutely true. He said, "We use European instruments and perform it in a Chinese style."

The Chinese nation uses the components of European music and integrates it into its own musical tradition. The creativity of Chinese artists themselves is enriched by the use of European methods of expression. But it has not been mixed or swallowed by foreign things, just like the general imperialist aggressors, conquering the colonial national art. Contrary to European art, the traditional foundation of the Chinese nation forms the foundation of their art. Violins, silver flutes, trumpets, gongs and drums, etc., are actually used in a "Chinese way" and cooperate with Chinese instruments, although sometimes only Chinese instruments are used in the opera, but this does not make the opera music a mixed style, but surprisingly forms its own personality.

Speaking of the art of the actors, especially the actors who played Xi'er, Huang Shiren, Yang Bailao, etc., it is really amazing and praiseworthy. Their performances are all based on realistic viewpoints, and they have achieved a high degree of success in deeply entering the roles, making people wonder: is the power of the play's style and the moving plot more powerful, or is it due to the actors' "faithful to detail performance"? The dialogue performance in the play is also very realistic, beautiful and generous.

Is it strange and unfamiliar? From the opening to the closing, the audience was in a silent and tense atmosphere. It was not until the satisfactory end that they breathed a sigh of relief. We all feel that we are living with these simple, lovely and pure Chinese people, experiencing their pain, their heroism, and their spirit of fighting for life, for freedom, and for a brilliant culture.

The actors' very skilled and powerful performance techniques are often highlighted by the most beautiful stage sets. These stage sets are very appropriate and artistically perfect. Whether it is a delicate or strong set, or a terrifying set, like the tiger picture hung by the reactionary landlord in his reception room, it symbolizes his own privileges and unreasonableness. All the scenery is beautiful and rich in color.

Our art workers should open their eyes and think more in order to fully utilize the performance of Chinese people's art works into their own creative work. We must learn from Chinese poets, composers, and stage designers, and learn many important things in the creation of new opera. (Translated by Wang Yunfeng)

### 德国艺术家对中国音乐舞蹈和歌剧“白毛女”的评价

    德国艺术家对中国音乐舞蹈和歌剧“白毛女”的评价
    编者按：中国青年代表团文艺工作团在柏林第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节中的演出，得到了各国青年的热烈欢迎。德国报刊上发表了不少评论和介绍。兹选刊八月十四日“每日周览”上所刊马格锐次教授及八月十五日“新德意志报”上所刊梅耶教授的两篇文章，以说明国际友人对新中国艺术的热爱与重视。
    新中国向世界青年发言
    德国马格锐次教授
    中国的文艺节目无疑是联欢节晚会中最精彩的艺术成就之一，这可以由下面的事实来说明：伟大的中华民族在以毛泽东为领袖的共产党领导下，经过胜利的革命斗争，从帝国主义剥削和压迫下解放出来，在经济上获得伟大成就，奠定了发展中国人民艺术的物质基础。
    中国艺术家懂得怎样将他们伟大的民族传统加以革新，有力地充实了它的内容和形式，而将它提到较高的阶段。这次的表演节目是中国伟大的文化革命的一个最好的证明。这也是观众在每一段表演之后热烈地赞美和疯狂地鼓掌的原因。
    中国传统艺术的特点最显著的可以在独唱、器乐和古典剧（指京剧“三岔口”——译者）方面看出来，其中古典剧这种艺术形式在德国还是第一次见到。（以下“三岔口”故事梗概略去——译者）这件人民的英勇历史是用很少的语言叙述出来的。在我们德国，从来未见过像这样富于表演手段的舞剧，像这样理想的音乐的伴奏，这些都使我们觉得特殊地动人。
    这个古典剧使我们对于中国艺术的大众化的面貌获得一个深刻的印象，同时中国艺术家所表演的舞蹈，更深刻地表现了人民艺术中的浓厚的民族色彩。
    红绸舞受到狂热的喝采。我们在看到中国的造型艺术时，无不惊羡他们那样熟练地掌握了艺术手段，那样高度地精通手工技巧。现在又在颜色鲜艳的集体舞蹈里看到了轻捷的身材和由红绸舞成的各种巧妙形状。这实在是再好也没有的一次观摩会。
    富于深刻和细致诗意的月下舞蹈，是一种优美和愉快的舞蹈。年轻的村民在光亮的月夜各带乐器集合起来，少女们穿插在他们中间，按着富于表情的音乐跳舞。另外一种类似哑剧的捕蝶舞，是富于儿童的愉快表情的人民舞蹈。在这种舞蹈中，中国人民的愉快感觉被高度地艺术化了。
    中国表演艺术的另一个特点是富于幽默。这不仅在表情的舞蹈里可以看出来，也特别显露在各种惊人的杂技表演中；不仅在那种几乎不能相信的体力表演中，也特别在青年杂技家们的富于意外的表现中。这些都引起观众的不断的喝采和掌声。
    在独唱里和乐器表演方面，中国五声音阶对于我们虽觉生疏，可是它的表现力量，也就是音乐的感人力量，是非常强大的。那个唱“我老汉”的歌唱者用很好的低音唱出一个老人自从解放后有了自己的房屋、田地以后的心情，动人地表现了中国人民对他们伟大领袖毛泽东的尊敬和感谢。
    从这支歌曲上显示出旧的歌咏音乐通过富于表现力的乐谱和音色响亮的和音，得到了新的成功。这种在中国人民生活和艺术中产生的新形式，在晚会开始和结束的大合唱中，更有力量地表现出来。
    在这两个大合唱中，表现了中国人民艺术无限的力量。“黄河大合唱”把这个雄伟的中国河流提高成为有高度民族意义的象征。这是一支说明中国人民爱好和平和对祖国的赞歌。这支富于感情变化的合唱的音调很是丰富，具有强度的戏剧意味，独唱的穿插更充实了内容。
    这个愉快的晚会是中国人民的创造力量和他们高度发展的文化和伟大民族传统的证明。这些艺术的深刻情感加强了中国人民对美国强盗的仇恨，说明了新中国在中国共产党和毛泽东领导下得到了光辉灿烂的发展。
    到会的各国代表感谢中国朋友给他们这样非凡的赠礼，而回敬以连续不断的掌声。这个晚会可算做是在各国用以表示友谊的艺术表演的链子上的一个特别光彩美丽的环节。（王运丰译）
    中国歌剧“白毛女”在柏林的初次演出是一件大事
    德国国家奖章获得人梅耶教授
    “白毛女”歌剧于八月十一日在柏林喜剧院表演两次，它对一切观众说来都是一件动人的经历。这个“新型的歌剧”，如节目单中所称，是中国诗人和编剧家们的集体创作。在这里我们看见了歌剧创作的一个重要的革新。它的导演和舞台设计工作，都不是依靠一个人来做的，而是由许多艺术家合作成功的。（下面为剧情介绍从略——译者）这个故事本身的威力，和他的现实性经过歌剧艺术的结构更形加强了。
    这不是一个具有欧洲传统意味的歌剧。歌唱不是本剧的主要目的，不像许多西欧歌剧一样，音乐只有在增强表演效果、描写情感，和凡是用言语、布景不能彻底表现的地方才使用它。在这个歌剧中，歌唱加强了剧情中的高潮和转变，它表现了动人的场面，而且音乐在全剧中不是继续不断的，有时在很长的阶段中只用对话，有时也只用道白，只说不唱，而由乐队伴奏。
    它的音乐经常是动人的，不论在抒情或表演方面，不论在表达绝望或最大的兴奋时都是一样。同时这种音乐是最大众化的，任何人都能立刻明了它。每个观众的情绪都能毫无困难地随着音乐的发展而变化。在剧中我们不断地听到中国人民的歌曲调子。因为这个歌剧是为千千万万中国人民创作的，不是像在德国歌剧界常有的现象一样，仅是为少数欣赏家而写作的。它要写人民的斗争，不是写非典型的东西，也不是写仅为社会上不生产的人们所爱好的东西，而是要表演为劳动大众所需要的艺术。
    乐队是以中国的和欧洲的乐器组成的。歌唱则是按照纯粹的中国传统格式。乐谱的形式和风格有时也有点欧洲的风味，这点可以在和声中运用一部分欧洲音阶中看出来，但是一位中国观众在休息时告诉我的话是绝对有理的，他说：“我们利用欧洲乐器而以中国风格表演它。”
    中国民族利用了欧洲音乐的成份，而把它溶合在自己的音乐传统里。中国艺术家本身的创造由于使用欧洲的表现方法，而内容更加丰富了。但并没有被外来的东西所掺杂或吞并，像一般帝国主义侵略者，征服殖民地民族艺术一样。和欧洲艺术相反，中国民族的传统基础形成了他们的艺术根基。小提琴、银笛、喇叭、锣鼓等，实际上都以“中国方式”被使用着，和中国乐器配合起来，虽然有时也在歌剧中也有仅用中国乐器的地方，但这并不能把歌剧音乐看成混合风格，反而惊人地形成了它自己的个性。
    谈到演员艺术方面，特别是扮演喜儿、黄世仁、杨白劳等这几位演员，真是令人惊异，称赞得无以复加。他们的表演都是从现实主义观点出发的，而且达到了深入角色的高度成功，使人不知道：究竟是此剧的风格的潜力和动人的剧情感人的力量大呢，还是由于演员的“忠实于细节表现”？剧中的对话表演也是十分逼真，美丽大方的。
    说它是生疏奇异吗？从开场到闭幕，观众都在寂静无声的紧张气氛里。直到最后满意结束，才透出一口气来。我们都感觉自己和这些单纯可爱纯洁的中国人民，生活在一起，体会到他们的痛苦，他们的英勇，和他们为生命、为自由、为灿烂的文化而奋斗的精神。
    演员的非常纯熟有力的表演技术，时常由于那些最美丽的舞台布景而更突出地表现出来。这些舞台布景，都很适当，在艺术上都很完美。不论它是细致的或是强烈的布景，或者是带恐怖性的布景，就像反动地主在他会客室里，所挂的猛虎图一样，正象征了他自己的特权和无理。一切风景都是色调优美而丰富的。
    我们的艺术工作者应该打开眼界，多多思索，以便将中国人民艺术作品的表演完全利用到自己的创造工作上来。我们要从中国诗人、作曲家、舞台布景设计家学习，学习他们在新歌剧创作中的很多重要的东西。（王运丰译）
