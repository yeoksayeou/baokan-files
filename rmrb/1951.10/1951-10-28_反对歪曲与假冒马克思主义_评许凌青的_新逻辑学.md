    Opposing the Distortion and Falsification of Marxism
    —A Critique of Xu Lingqing's "New Logic"
    Ruo Shui
    The "New Logic" by Xu Lingqing, published last year by the Shanghai Magazine Company, has been printed in its second edition this year. This is a booklet that peddles anti-Marxist goods under the guise of Marxism.
    Just how "new" is the "logic" of this "New Logic"? The preface of the book begins by saying: The construction of New China places "ideological construction as the most important," because "this was already advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the 'National Reconstruction Program' (the first chapter is psychological reconstruction) and by Chairman Mao in 'On New Democracy.'"—Right from the start, this reveals the author's ignorance of basic Marxist knowledge. "Psychological reconstruction" is the idealistic dross in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's democratic revolutionary thought, which is precisely the part of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thought system that differs from Marxism. The author insists on holding up this dross and equating it with "On New Democracy." I ask, where does the latter say that ideological construction is paramount, this kind of idealistic tune? The author goes on to say, "But how can thought be scientific? It is impossible without understanding logic as the methodology of thought. Therefore, since the failure of the Great Revolution, I have been engaged in the research and teaching of logic, especially dialectical logic." Let's see how painstakingly the author engages in "ideological construction": "This booklet is an outline of the drafts I have lectured on over the past twenty years in universities, middle schools, and academic organizations such as research classes, training groups, and concentration camps in Poyang, Kaifeng, Beijing, Chongqing, Xi'an, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, and other places." Readers, please remember: The author was "lecturing" in "training groups" and "concentration camps" under the clutches of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents. One can imagine what kind of person he is. For such a person to talk about Marxism is an insult to Marxism! Originally, there was no need to comment on such a bad booklet written by such a person, but because he puts on an "academic" face, I am afraid that some readers will still be deceived. Therefore, I have to spend some time on it.
    The first chapter of the main text is "Logic is the Science of Sciences." According to the author's definition, "The study of the universality of all things, that is, the general and fundamental study of things, is called philosophy" (hence there are "natural philosophy," "social philosophy," and "thought philosophy"); "The study of the particularity of all things, that is, the individual and trivial study of things, is called science." The author expresses his great respect for "science." He not only advocates "science" but also advocates the "science of sciences." According to his own definition, of course, he wants to "individually and trivially study things." The more individual and trivial, the more scientific. At the apex is the "science of sciences." However, although this book is called New Logic, it is fundamentally illogical. In the same chapter, the author seems to regard the "science of sciences" as a kind of universal learning, and says it is "the sum of the conclusions of various sciences." This "science of sciences" is called "Creative Change Logic" by the author.
    This is another "new" term—although it is only a new "term." This Mr. Xu Lingqing arrogantly replaces the commonly used term "dialectical" with "creative change," and also says that the latter is "easier to understand in terms of its literal meaning or in accordance with its name." (Literally, the term "creative change" makes one think of the "creative evolution" of the French mystic Bergson!)
    In the second chapter, "Schools and Classifications of Logic," the author says that there are four types of logic. According to the terms invented by the author, these are: "Invariant Logic," "Constant Change Logic," "Mutual Change Logic," and "Creative Change Logic." In the chapter on "Invariant Logic," the author talks about Aristotle's "formal logic," Indian Hetu-vidya, and the Mohist's Three-Object Theory. In the chapter on "Constant Change Logic," the author talks about Heraclitus's intuitive dialectic, Shakyamuni's "theory of impermanence," and Darwin's theory of evolution. In the chapter on "Mutual Change Logic," there are "The Book of Changes's way of thinking" (here the author talks a lot about his Bagua), "Lao Tzu's way of thinking," "Zhuang Tzu's way of thinking" (in these two sections, the author copies a full seventeen pages of the "Tao Te Ching" and "Qiwulun"), "The School of Names's way of thinking" (here he lists some of Hui Shi's sophistries, such as "Eggs have hair," "Chickens have three legs," "Dogs are not canines," etc.), as well as the Book of Documents, the Doctrine of the Mean, the Lüshi Chunqiu, the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate, the Five Elements, and the Sixty-Year Cycle of Ganzhi. It is really a dazzling array, encompassing everything. This is not only a Chinese medicine shop, but also sells Western medicine. Chinese and Western logic, everything is available. For these things, the author has a total of less than four lines of so-called "criticism." This has no other effect than to confuse people's minds and show off their quack-like "knowledge."
    It was not easy to get to "Creative Change Logic," and half of the book has already been used up. Let's see how the author handles this chapter: "Hegel's Dialectic" (absurdly, this section is entirely copied from a passage of Stalin's on dialectics, which has nothing to do with Hegel, and there are no quotation marks or notes before and after it), "Marx's Materialist Dialectic" (this section is simply a simple copy of a passage from the postscript to the second edition of the first volume of "Capital"), "Lenin's Materialist Dialectic" (all taken from Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks"), "Stalin's Dialectic" (all taken from Chapter 4 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"). After more than thirty pages of copying, the author came to a "criticism" at the end (!). Let's see how the author "criticizes":
    "This kind of creative change logic, it recognizes that in the affirmative aspect, everything is invariant, absolute, identical, has being and non-being (sic—Ruo Shui), is static, and is positive to the end; in the negative aspect, everything is constantly changing, relative, different, finite, dynamic, and is negative to the end. ..." (p. 80 of the original book)
    See how far the author has distorted dialectics! It turns out that dialectics is an absolutely unchanging aspect plus a relatively changing aspect! The relative change certainly cannot overcome the absolute invariance. Is this dialectics? – This is unadulterated metaphysics serving the reactionary class!
    Revolution is a dialectical law. Since the author has distorted dialectics, he will inevitably distort revolution in theory. And that is indeed the case. On page 46, the author listed a formula: Revolution = Re-evolution; on page 88, the author explained:
    "The English term for revolution is 'Revolution,' in which 'Vo-lution' means 'evolution,' and 'Re' means 'again'; therefore, revolution is to constantly seek evolution."
    In order to distort the true meaning of revolution, when feeling theoretically exhausted, one has to degenerate to playing tricks with words. Engels once sarcastically mocked this kind of technique: "This etymological trick is the last escape route of idealist philosophy." (Feuerbach) The purpose of this technique is nothing more than to make the reader believe: since "revolution = re-evolution," then conversely, "re-evolution = revolution" is certainly correct. Therefore, we only need to "constantly seek evolution," constantly and gradually improve, and we can do without revolution.
    Since evolution is equal to revolution, then how should we "constantly seek evolution"? The author did not say it explicitly; but we can find the author's answer from another place. See the following passage:
    "The reason why Western Europe is advanced and East Asia is backward is that Western Europe has already undergone the industrial revolution and is now entering the atomic energy revolution. It is so-called 'science omnipotent', while China is still in the era of using hands as omnipotent. Precisely because of this, we must 'catch up'." (p. 6)
    You see, "develop science," learn from the West, and take the path of capitalism and imperialism. This is the direction of "evolution" in the author's mind. The author wants the great, advanced New China to "catch up" with the corrupt and declining Western Europe! Isn't this absurd!
    This is the content of the book "New Logic." Of course, there are many other errors in it, and it would be a waste of space to point them out item by item. The above is enough to show what kind of book this is. In short, we can draw the conclusion from this: this book only has a large pile of miscellaneous materials organized according to idealistic, metaphysical, confused and reactionary viewpoints, plus a half-disguised so-called dialectics; there is not only no "science of sciences" here, there is no science at all; not only no "new" logic, there is simply no logic. No wonder the author could travel to big cities in the southeast, northwest, and everywhere to lecture on his "dialectics" in training classes and concentration camps during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime! What kind of reactionaries in the world would be afraid of this kind of "dialectics"! On the contrary, in order to anesthetize and deceive progressive youth, reactionaries are welcoming this counterfeit dialectics. This Mr. Xu Lingqing served the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, and today, after liberation, he still wants to continue to swindle and deceive so shamelessly, which is unforgivable!
    The emergence of the work "New Logic" shows that there are still some people today with serious ideological errors, even reactionary ones, who have not determined to transform themselves. They still cling to the old, corrupt and reactionary set of the past, and even claim that their set was originally progressive, revolutionary, and in line with Marxism. They have many idealistic and metaphysical thoughts, so they put these things together to form their own "system." They deliberately place Marxism as a banner high above their "system" building (just as the author of this book respects dialectics as the latest logic), but inside this building are hidden all kinds of idealistic and metaphysical fake goods. They think that this will allow them to pass unimpeded in the market. This kind of false Marxism must be severely criticized. They should realize that this kind of behavior cannot deceive people. If they really want to change their minds and faces, they must be honest, bow their heads to the people and admit their guilt, and they must never be allowed to impersonate Marxism to deceive people.

    反对歪曲与假冒马克思主义
    ——评许凌青的“新逻辑学”
    若水
    上海杂志公司去年出版的许凌青著的“新逻辑学”，今年印行了第二版。这是一本披着马克思主义外衣而贩运反马克思主义货色的小册子。
    这本“新逻辑学”的“逻辑”究竟是怎样“新”法呢？该书序言的开头说：新中国的建设，以“思想建设尤为首要”，因为“这是孙中山先生在‘建国方略’（第一篇就是心理建设）上，毛主席在‘新民主主义论’中就早已揭櫫了的。”——这里一上来就暴露了作者对马克思主义常识的无知。“心理建设”是孙中山先生民主主义革命思想中的唯心的糟粕，这刚好是孙中山先生思想体系中与马克思主义不同的部分，作者却偏要把这糟粕捧出，并且和“新民主主义论”并提起来。试问后者在什么地方说过思想建设是首要的这种唯心论调呢？作者接下去说，“只是思想如何而后可以科学化？这就非了解作为思想方法论的逻辑学不为功。所以我自大革命失败后，即从事逻辑学尤其辩证逻辑的研究和讲述。”且看作者是怎样辛苦地从事“思想建设”吧：“这本小册子，就是我二十年来先后在鄱阳、在开封、在北平、在重庆、在西安、在南京、在徐州、在郑州、在镇江、在杭州、在上海、在汉口、在其他各地的大学、中学以及什么研究班、训练团、集中营等等学术团体所讲的稿子纲要。”请读者记住：作者是在蒋匪特务魔爪下的“训练团”和“集中营”里“讲书”的，他是什么样的人，就可想而知了。这样的人居然谈起马克思主义，岂不是污辱了马克思主义吗？对于这样的人所写的恶劣的小册子，本来是不必评论的，但是因为他装着“学术”的面孔，恐怕有些读者仍会受骗，因此，不得不费些笔墨了。
    正文第一章是“逻辑学是科学的科学”。依作者的定义，“研究一切事物的普遍性，即一般地根本地去研究事物的叫做哲学”（因此就有什么“自然哲学”、“社会哲学”、“思惟哲学”）；“研究一切事物的特殊性，即个别地枝节地去研究事物的叫做科学”。作者表示自己非常尊崇“科学”，他不但主张“科学”，而且主张“科学的科学”。如果按他自己的定义来说，那当然就是要“个别地枝节地去研究事物”，越是个别和枝节，越是科学，至于顶点，就是“科学的科学”。然而这本书虽名为新逻辑学，本身却根本不合逻辑。同一章内，作者却似乎又把“科学的科学”当作一种普遍的学问，并说它是什么“诸种科学结论的总和”。这种“科学的科学”，作者名之曰“创变逻辑”。
    这又是一个“新”名词——虽然也不过是新“名词”而已。这位许凌青先生妄自作古地把大家通用的“辩证”这个名词改译为“创变”，还说前者不如后者“顾名思义或名符其实地易于理解。”（顾名思义，“创变”这个名词多么使人想起法国神秘主义者柏格森的“创化”！）
    在第二章“逻辑学的派系和分类”中，作者说逻辑有四种。按照作者所发明的名词，这就是：“不变逻辑”、“常变逻辑”、“互变逻辑”、“创变逻辑”。在“不变逻辑”一章中，作者谈到了亚里士多德的“形式逻辑”、印度的因明、墨家的三物论式。在“常变逻辑”一章中，作者谈到了赫拉克里图的直观辩证法、释加牟尼的“无常论”、达尔文的进化论。在“互变逻辑”一章中，有“周易的思想方法”（在这里作者大谈其八卦）、“老子的思想方法”、“庄子的思想方法”（在这两节中作者抄引了整整十七页的“道德经”和“齐物论”）、“名家的思想方法”（这里单列举了一些惠施的诡辩，如“卵有毛”、“鸡三足”、“狗非犬”等）、还有尚书、中庸、吕览、太极图说、五行、六十花甲子，真是五花八门，无所不包。这不但是一个中药铺，而且兼卖西药，中西逻辑，一应俱全。对于这些东西，作者统共只有不到四行的所谓“批判”。这除了混乱人的头脑和炫耀自己的江湖郎中式的“学识”以外，没有任何别的作用。
    好容易到了“创变逻辑”，全书已去了一半篇幅了。且来看看作者是怎样处理这一章的吧：“黑格尔的辩证法”（荒唐透顶的是这一节完全是照抄斯大林论辩证法的一段话，与黑格尔毫无关系，前后也没有引号和注）、“马克思的唯物辩证法”（这一节全文只是简单地抄录“资本论”第一卷第二版跋的一段）、“列宁的唯物辩证法”（全部录自列宁的“哲学笔记”）、“斯大林的辩证法”
    （全部录自“联共党史”第四章）。在三十多页的抄录之后作者却在篇末来了一段“批判”（！）。请看作者是如何“批判”的吧：
    “这种创变逻辑，它认定一切事物在肯定方面，是不变的，是绝对的，是同一的，是有无的（原文如此——若水），是静的，是正到底的；在否定方面，是常变的，是相对的，是差别的，是有限的，是动的，是反到底的。……”（原书第八十页）
    请看作者把辩证法歪曲到什么程度！原来辩证法是一个绝对不变的方面加上一个相对变化的方面！相对的变当然不能胜过绝对的不变。这是辩证法么？——这是不折不扣的为反动阶级服务的形而上学！
    革命是辩证的规律，作者既然歪曲了辩证法，因而也就必然要在理论上歪曲革命。而事实也果然如此。在第四十六页上，作者列了一个公式：革命＝再进化；到第八十八页作者又加以解说：
    “革命的英文名词是“Revolution”，其中“Vo-lution”是“进化”的意思，“Re”是“再”的意思；所以革命就是要不断的求进化。”
    为了歪曲革命的真义，在感到理论穷竭的时候，只得堕落到在名词上玩花样。恩格斯曾经尖刻地讥嘲过这种手法：“这种语源学上的诡计，本是唯心论哲学的最后一条逃路。”（费尔巴哈论）这种手法的目的，无非是想使读者相信：既然“革命＝再进化”，那么反过来说“再进化＝革命”当然也是对的，因此我们只要“不断的求进化”，不断地逐渐改良，就可以不要革命了。
    既然进化就等于革命，那么应当如何“不断的求进化”呢？作者没有明说；但我们是可以从另外的地方找出作者的答案的。请看下面一段话：
    “西欧之所以为先进，而东亚之所以为后进的，因西欧既早已经过产业革命，现又进入原子能革命，所谓‘科学万能’，而中国犹在以双手为万能的时代。正因为如此，所以要‘迎头赶上’。”（第六页）
    你看，“发展科学”，学习西方，走资本主义和帝国主义的道路。这就是作者意中的“进化”的方向。作者要伟大的先进的新中国去“迎头赶上”腐朽没落的西欧！这岂不是荒唐透顶了吗！
    这就是“新逻辑学”这本书的内容。当然，其中错误还有很多，要仔细地去逐项指出，是未免浪费篇幅的。上面这些，已足够显示这是一本什么样子的书了。总之，从这里我们可以得出结论：这本书有的只是一大堆按照唯心的形而上学的混乱而反动的观点组织起来的驳杂的材料加上半截伪装上去的所谓辩证法；这里不但没有什么“科学的科学”，根本就没有科学；不但没有什么“新”逻辑，干脆就没有逻辑。难怪在国民党反动政权统治时期，作者可以走遍东南西北的大城市，到什么训练班和集中营去大讲其“辩证法”了！天下有那一种反动派会害怕这种“辩证法”呢！相反的，为了麻醉和欺骗进步的青年，反动派正欢迎这种冒牌的辩证法。这位许凌青先生在解放前为国民党反动派服务，而在解放后的今天，竟还这样厚颜无耻地想来继续进行招摇撞骗，这是不可宽恕的！
    “新逻辑学”这本著作的出现，说明了在今天仍有一些思想严重错误甚至是反动的人，没有下决心改造自己。他们还死抱着过去那腐朽反动的一套不放，甚至自称他们那一套原来就是进步的、革命的、合乎马克思主义的。他们有许多唯心的形而上学的思想，于是他们便把这些东西搭配起来，构成他们自己的“体系”。他们故意把马克思主义作为旗帜高高地插在他们的“体系”建筑物之上（如同本书的作者把辩证法尊为最新的逻辑一样），而在这建筑物之内却隐藏了各色各样唯心论与形而上学的假货。他们以为这样就可以在市场上通行无阻。这种假马克思主义必须受到严正的批判。他们应该认识，这样作法是骗不了人的，如果真要革心换面，就要老实一些，向人民低头认罪，决不容许假冒马克思主义来骗人。
