Brief Comment on Party Life

    Eradicate Bureaucracy that Suppresses Criticism

    Those who resist criticism often see criticism as a "blow," a "loss of face," or "deliberately making things difficult" for them. In reality, these comrades do not understand the great significance of self-criticism to the Communist Party and the working class, and therefore cannot treat criticism with the correct attitude of a Communist Party member. These comrades are not ashamed of being detached from the masses for a long time, but take pride in it. They only blame others and not themselves, they are willing to talk about achievements but dare not expose shortcomings, they love to hear flattery but hate to hear criticism. When someone dares to criticize, expose, or accuse them, they take various measures to resist and strike back. This is a thoroughly corrupt and decadent liberalist style, which corrodes the Party organization and harms the interests of the masses. Therefore, it must not be tolerated or allowed to exist. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPC issued instructions requiring Party organizations throughout the province to wage a struggle against erroneous tendencies of arrogance, complacency, suppression of criticism, and violation of Party discipline. This is absolutely necessary. Chairman Mao said: "If we do not criticize bureaucratic tendencies in local work, and if we do not criticize warlordist tendencies in the army, then we are willing to preserve the Kuomintang style, willing to retain the dust of bureaucracy and warlordism on our pure faces, then we are not good Party members." Every Communist Party member should practice Chairman Mao's instructions in daily life, and at the same time deeply study the CCP Central Committee's decision to carry out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, and fight against all bureaucratic ideas that suppress criticism in accordance with Party principles. The report and brief commentary published in this newspaper on September 11 regarding the suppression of mass criticism by Song Ying, deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau, and the handling of this incident by the Central China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee can be used as reference for various regions. The Central China Bureau's vigorous and high-profile method of combating bureaucracy is the best way to overcome bureaucratic problems and is worthy of learning from by various regions.

    No Party Member Can Regard Himself as Special

    All Party members should strictly abide by the obligations and rights stipulated in the Party Constitution. "Special Party members" are not allowed to exist in our Party. However, some Party members, because they have made contributions to the revolution, regard themselves as special, complacent, and have no regard for the organization. Chen Pinzhang, a civil affairs assistant in the Huian District Public Office of Qidong County, Northern Jiangsu, and a Communist Party member, is one such example. Chen Pinzhang sacrificed and struggled in the long-term struggle against the enemy, resulting in physical disability, which is glorious. However, he became complacent because of this and developed hedonistic and corrupt ideas. In July, he misappropriated 1.7 million yuan of public funds raised for the construction of a martyrs' pagoda for business. After the leading comrades discovered this, they gave him criticism and education. However, he said: "I have been in the revolution for more than ten years, suffered hardships, and shed blood. What does it matter if I temporarily misappropriate a little public funds?!" He also demanded to live in a good house. When someone offered him advice, he threatened to retire and return to his hometown, saying: "If I make a mistake, I will not work. Give me thirteen years of demobilization rations, and I can do business and eat and use it for the rest of my life." This is a politically degenerate and extremely dishonorable manifestation.

    The Party and the people respect all those who have made contributions and give them appropriate care; however, everyone who has made contributions should move forward on the basis of a glorious history and do more for the people, just like many combat heroes and model workers who have personally practiced "not being arrogant or complacent, adding merit to merit," and must not regard themselves as special, or even fail to fulfill their obligations as Party members. Otherwise, he cannot move forward. Chairman Mao said: "All the words and deeds of Communists should be judged by the highest standard of whether they conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and whether they are supported by the broadest masses of the people." This is the action guideline for every Party member.

    党的生活简评
    根除压制批评的官僚主义
    抵抗批评的人常常把批评看作是对自己的“打击”，“丢面子”，“故意为难”。实际上是这些同志不了解自我批评与共产党和工人阶级的重大意义，因而也就不能以共产党员的正确态度来对待批评；这些同志长期脱离群众不以为耻，反以为荣，他们只能责备别人，不责备自己，愿意高谈成绩，不敢揭发缺点，爱听恭维话，不爱听批评话。遇有人敢于批评，揭发，指责，他们便采取各种方式给以抵抗和打击。这是一种十足腐朽的自由主义作风，它腐蚀着党的组织，损害着群众利益，因此，绝不能听之任之，容许其存在。中共湖北省委纪律检查委员会发布指示要求全省党的组织向骄傲自满，压制批评，违犯党的纪律的错误倾向进行斗争。这是完全必要的。毛主席说：“如果在地方工作中不批评官僚主义倾向，在军队中不批评军阀主义倾向，那就是愿意保存国民党作风，愿意保留官僚主义与军阀主义灰尘在自己纯洁的脸上，那就不是个好党员。”每一个共产党员都应当在日常生活中实践毛主席的指示，同时深入地学习中共中央在报纸刊物上开展批评与自我批评的决定，按照党的原则，同一切压制批评的官僚主义思想进行斗争。九月十一日本报所发表的关于武汉市卫生局副局长宋瑛等压制群众批评的报道和简评以及中共中央中南局对这一事件的处理可供各地参考。中南局对官僚主义所采取的雷厉风行大张旗鼓的斗争方法，是克服官僚主义毛病的最好的办法，值得各地学习。
    任何党员不能自视特殊
    一切党员均应严格遵守党章所规定的义务和权利，“特殊党员”在我们党内是不容许存在的。但是，有的党员因为对革命有过功绩，竟自视特殊，居功自傲，目无组织。苏北启东县惠安区公所民政助理员、共产党员陈品章就是一个例子。陈品章在长期的对敌斗争中，牺牲奋斗，以致身体残废，这是光荣的。可是，他却因此居功自傲，滋长了享乐腐化思想。七月间，他擅自挪用募建烈士塔的公款一百七十万元做生意。领导同志发现后，给以批评教育。他却说：“我革命十多年，吃苦，流血，暂时挪用一点公款，有什么关系？！”他还要求住好房子，有人给他提意见，他便以复员退休来威胁，说：“犯了错误，就不做工作。给我十三年的复员粮，做做生意，一生吃用不完。”这是一种政治上堕落的极不光荣的表现。
    党和人民对于一切有过功绩的人，都是尊重的，并且给他们以适当的照顾；但是每一个有过功绩的人，都应该在光荣的历史基础上前进，为人民作更多的事情，如同许多战斗英雄、劳动模范所身体力行的那样，“不骄不傲，功上加功”，而决不能自视特殊，甚至不履行党员义务。否则他就不能前进。毛主席说：“共产党人的一切言论、行动，以是否合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，是否为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”这是每个党员的行动指针。
