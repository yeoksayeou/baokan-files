    The Struggle for Freedom of Marriage Will Surely Triumph

    The fact that Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun freely married illustrates a principle: the marriage freedom of the broad masses of young men and women must rely on a tenacious struggle against the feudal marriage system, and this struggle, under the leadership of the People's Government, can be completely victorious.

    The pre-marital experiences of Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun represent the experiences of some rural young men and women today: family obstruction, opposition from some village cadres, lack of enthusiastic assistance from some district cadres, matchmakers making trouble with flowery words, and even ulterior motives from figures like Zhao Mingjiu, who try their best to sabotage. The only effective way to deal with these obstacles is to fight. Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun broke through layers of obstacles precisely by using the method of struggle and realized their desire for free marriage. The fact that Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun freely married points out a correct path to the vast number of men and women still oppressed by the feudal marriage system: fight for freedom of marriage!

    There are many men and women who have won freedom of marriage like Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun. Governments and related organizations in various regions should be good at using these facts to widely publicize the Marriage Law, using oral publicity, written publicity, picture publicity, and slide publicity, so that the broad masses of men and women understand: persisting in the struggle for freedom of marriage will surely be victorious, and that thousands upon thousands of Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun will shatter the shackles of the feudal marriage system and establish the new democratic marriage system.

    争取婚姻自由的斗争一定胜利
    邰秀英、孙田均自由结婚的事实说明了一个道理：广大青年男女的婚姻自由，必须依靠顽强地向封建婚姻制度进行斗争，而这种斗争，在人民政府的领导下，是完全可以得到胜利的。
    邰秀英、孙田均二人婚前的遭遇，代表了当前某些农村青年男女的遭遇：家庭阻碍，某些村干部反对，某些区干部不热情帮助，媒婆花言巧语搬弄是非，甚至别有用心的如赵明九之流的人物，极力从中进行破坏。对于这些障碍，唯一有效的办法是进行斗争。邰秀英与孙田均正是用斗争的方法冲破了层层障碍，实现了自由结婚的愿望。邰秀英与孙田均自由结婚的事实，给广大的仍受着封建婚姻制度压迫的男女指出了一条正确的道路：为婚姻自由而奋斗！
    与邰秀英、孙田均一样争得婚姻自由的男女是很多的，各地政府及有关团体应善于利用这些事实，来广泛地进行婚姻法的宣传，用口头宣传，用文字宣传，制图片宣传，制幻灯宣传，让广大男女懂得：坚持婚姻自由的斗争一定会得到胜利，让千千万万个邰秀英、孙田均击碎封建婚姻制度的枷锁，把新民主主义的婚姻制度建立起来。
