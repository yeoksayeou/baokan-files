    The Play "Reforming Oneself" Contains Errors that Fail to Distinguish Between Friend and Foe
Editor:
    Recently, I read "Reforming Oneself" by Li Zhongyu (one of the drama series, published by Cultural Work Society). I think this play has errors in its content that fail to distinguish between friend and foe. In the play, Jin Yuesu, the daughter-in-law of a landlord and the wife of a Kuomintang military officer, is written as very progressive, while Shen Guiying, a turned-over peasant and the family member of a revolutionary soldier, is written as very backward. As soon as the landlord's daughter-in-law appears, she goes with the village cadres to mobilize women to participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. She says: "Although I, Yuesu, am the daughter-in-law of a landlord, I also understand the good principles of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and defending the country. In the past, although I had good food, good clothes, and good enjoyment, I was separated from the sisters in the village. Today, the revolutionary class is eliminated (this sentence is wrong. The revolution in China at this stage is only to eliminate the forces of imperialism in China and eliminate the landlord class and comprador bourgeoisie, not to eliminate all classes. – Editor), and the sisters are very close." She advises her father-in-law: "Revolution is only one-sided, and there is no second way." Is it possible for people who live by exploiting peasants to be so progressive without any serious education and transformation? And could a military family member like Shen Guiying be so backward? The play says that Shen Guiying is usually respected and her life is getting better and better. She was about to write a letter of慰问 to her husband when she happened to encounter a special agent spreading rumors that "Chiang Kai-shek is about to fight back." Without thinking, she believed the agent's words and immediately wrote a letter advising her husband to desert. Her ideological transformation was influenced by the landlord's daughter-in-law. Such a description that fails to distinguish between friend and foe and reverses black and white is very harmful to readers.

### 剧本“重新作人”有敌我不分的错误

    剧本“重新作人”有敌我不分的错误编辑同志：
    最近我读了一本郦仲瑜著的“重新作人”（戏曲丛书之一，文化工作社出版），我觉得这个剧本在内容上有敌我不分的错误。剧本中把一个地主的儿媳妇、国民党军官的老婆金月素写得非常进步，把一个既是翻身农民，又是革命军人家属的沈桂英写得很落后。地主的儿媳一出场，就与村干部去动员妇女参加抗美援朝运动。她说：“我月素虽是地主媳，也懂得反帝反封建、保家卫国的好道理，想当日虽是好吃、好穿、好享受，却是和村中姐妹隔二天地，今日革命阶级除（这句话是错误的，中国目前阶段的革命只是肃清帝国主义在中国的势力，消灭地主阶级和买办资产阶级，不是消灭所有的阶级。——编者），姐姐妹妹多亲热”。她劝她的公公：“革命只有一边倒，道路没有第二条”。难道靠剥削农民生活的人，不经过任何严重的教育改造，就可能如此进步吗？而军属沈桂英，会是这样落后吗？剧中说，沈桂英平时受人尊敬，生活一天比一天好过，正想给丈夫写慰问信，恰巧碰上个特务造谣“蒋介石要打回来了”，她连思索也不思索就相信了特务的话，立即写信劝丈夫开小差。她的思想转变，还是受了地主儿媳的影响。这种敌我不分、颠倒黑白的描写，对于读者是很有害的。
