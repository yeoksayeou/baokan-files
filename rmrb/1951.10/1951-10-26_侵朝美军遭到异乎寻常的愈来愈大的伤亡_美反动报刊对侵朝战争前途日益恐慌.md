Xinhua News Agency, October 25th:
Li Qiwei and Van Fleet launched military offensives during the Korean armistice negotiations to support their unreasonable demands in the negotiations. As a result, the casualty curve of the U.S. aggressor troops has risen sharply, which has caused serious unease in the United States. Even the American big bourgeoisie newspapers, which have always boasted about Li Qiwei and Van Fleet, cannot hide their panic.

The American "Newsweek" published on October 8th included a chart that drew readers' attention to "How U.S. Casualties are Rapidly Increasing." Although the magazine's figures were based on the greatly reduced numbers from the U.S. Department of Defense, it was enough to clearly prove that casualties increased particularly rapidly after the U.S. side launched the so-called "offensive." The magazine used soldiers' head icons to represent the rapid increase in soldiers' casualties in the six weeks from August 1st to September 12th, increasing about nine times. The week ending August 8th was two and a half heads, followed by four, three and a half, six, nine, and the week ending September 12th, which was the last week of the magazine's statistical chart, surged to twenty-two heads.

"Newsweek" therefore expressed extreme panic about the future of the war and cited three important concerns: First, the shadow of winter warfare. The blows given to the U.S. military by the Chinese and Korean People's Army last winter clearly still lingered in the minds of American military and political leaders. Therefore, the magazine said: "Some Pentagon observers are worried about the prospect of fighting another winter war with new recruits replacing veteran soldiers who have returned for rotation." Second, the increase in the air force strength of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. The magazine specifically published a chart indicating that the strength of the Chinese and Korean People's Air Force active in the skies over Korea is growing rapidly, which is "unprecedentedly threatening" to the American aggressors. Third, the American people are increasingly dissatisfied with Li Qiwei and Van Fleet's continued obstruction of the armistice, which causes more American youth to die in vain. On this point, the magazine said: "The Army is worried about how long the American public can tolerate this tug-of-war war that seems to have no result other than increasing the graves in national cemeteries."

"Newsweek" worriedly pointed out that Li Qiwei's current position is "very similar to the position his predecessor was in last fall." That is to say, the unfortunate fate that MacArthur suffered last winter is now also facing Li Qiwei. Americans fear "winter will bring a new Communist offensive."

"Newsweek" is by no means the only American newspaper to openly express this concern. In fact, the surge in American casualties in Korea has become an important topic of general discussion in the American press. Wall Street's important mouthpiece, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, recently revealed the same fear. In an article, the magazine expressed unease about the huge casualties of the U.S. military in Korea, saying: Every week, one or two thousand (or even more) healthy Americans are sacrificed in the war. Americans are now paying a high price. If the war continues, they will pay an even higher price in the coming winter. The magazine also said: The relative proportion of American losses increases every week.

The huge and ever-increasing casualties of the U.S. aggressor troops are the real sorrow behind the mad clamor of the American imperialists. There is good reason why they cannot hide this sorrow. In the past year, the Chinese and Korean People's Army has caused more than 170,000 casualties to the U.S. military on a small Korean battlefield, far exceeding the casualties of the United States in the first year of World War II, and reaching about 70% of the average annual casualties of the United States during the entire four years of the war on the vast battlefields of Europe, Asia, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. Moreover, what has been lost is the elite of the American army, the main capital that American imperialists are trying to use to implement their global aggression plan.

### 侵朝美军遭到异乎寻常的愈来愈大的伤亡  美反动报刊对侵朝战争前途日益恐慌

    侵朝美军遭到异乎寻常的愈来愈大的伤亡
    美反动报刊对侵朝战争前途日益恐慌
    【新华社二十五日讯】李奇微和范佛里特在朝鲜停战谈判期间为配合他们在谈判中间提出的无理要求而发动军事攻势，结果反而使得美国侵略军的伤亡曲线急剧上升，这种情况已在美国国内引起严重不安。连一向为李奇微、范佛里特吹嘘的美国大资产阶级的报刊也无法掩饰其恐慌。
    十月八日出版的美国“新闻周刊”刊出了一个图表，引起读者注意“美国的伤亡如何急剧增加”。虽然该刊所根据的还是美国国防部大大缩小了的数字，但也足以清楚地证明，正是从美方在发动所谓“攻势”以后，伤亡的增加特别迅速。该刊用士兵的头像为单位表示从八月一日到九月十二日的六周中士兵的伤亡数迅速增加了约有九倍之多。至八月八日为止的这一周是两个半头，以后顺次为四个，三个半，六个，九个，到九月十二日为止的这一周，也即该刊统计图表的最后一周，竟激增到二十二个头。
    “新闻周刊”因此对于战局的前途表示极为恐慌，并举出三点重要忧虑：第一是冬季战争的阴影。去年冬季中朝人民军给予美军的打击显然使美国军政首脑至今犹有余悸，所以该刊说：“有些五角大楼的观察家对于用新兵代替轮换回来的老兵打另一次冬季战争的前景感到忧心。”第二是中朝人民部队的空军力量的增加。该刊特地刊出一项图表指明，活跃在朝鲜上空的中朝人民空军实力正在飞速增长，对于美国侵略者说来，是“空前地具有威胁性”。第三是美国人民对于李奇微——范佛里特继续阻挠停战而使更多美国青年无谓丧命的行为日益感到不满。该刊在这一点上说：“陆军方面担忧美国公众对于这种除了增加全国墓地的坟墓之外显然不会有任何结果的拉来推去的战争还能容忍多久。”
    “新闻周刊”忧虑地指出，李奇微目前的地位“和他的前任在去年秋天所处的地位非常相像”。这就是说，麦克阿瑟去年冬天所遭受的倒霉的命运现在同样也摆在李奇微前面。美国人害怕“冬天会带来一次新的共产党的进攻”。
    “新闻周刊”绝不是唯一公开表示这种忧虑的美国报刊。实际上，美国在朝鲜伤亡的激增已成为美国报刊目前普遍议论的一个重要题目。华尔街重要的喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志新近就透露了同样的恐惧。该刊在一篇文章里对于美军在朝鲜的巨大伤亡表示不安说：每周都有一两千（甚至更多）身体健康的美国人在战争中牺牲。美国人现在付出很高的代价。如果战争继续下去，在即将降临的冬天，他们将付出更高的代价。该刊也说：美国损失的相对比例每周都有增加。
    美国侵略军队这样逐日上涨的巨大伤亡，就是美国帝国主义分子疯狂叫嚣后面的真正的悲哀。他们藏不住这种悲哀是有充分理由的。中朝人民军队一年来使美军在一个狭小的朝鲜战场上就伤亡了十七万多人。远超过美国在第二次世界大战头一年的伤亡，而达到美国在整个大战四年中间在欧亚两洲与大西洋、太平洋的广大战场上每年平均伤亡数的约百分之七十。而且所损失掉的还是美国军队中的精华，是美帝国主义者企图用来实行其全球侵略计划的主要资本。
