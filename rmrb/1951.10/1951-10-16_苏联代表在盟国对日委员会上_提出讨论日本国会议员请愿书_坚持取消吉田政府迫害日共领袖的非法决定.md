Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: TASS Tokyo, 12th: Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Kislenko, proposed at the Council meeting on October 10th a petition from a group of Japanese Diet members regarding the illegal arrest of eight members of the Japanese Communist Party—including three Diet members—and the prohibition of their political activities. This illegal persecution was carried out by the Japanese authorities with the approval of Ridgway Headquarters. Soviet representative Kislenko supported this petition, suggesting that the Japanese government rescind this illegal decision and restore the aforementioned individuals' right to engage in political activities.

    U.S. representative Sebald expressed complete agreement with the Japanese government's illegal measures and slanderously claimed that the communists were engaged in sabotage activities. He admitted that the Japanese government's actions had been approved by the relevant departments of Ridgway Headquarters.

    However, Sebald avoided discussing the substance of the petition, attempting to turn the discussion of the petition into a purely procedural discussion regarding the rights of the Allied Council for Japan.

    British Commonwealth representative Hodgson also attempted to turn the discussion of the petition into a discussion of procedural issues. Hodgson said that the Japanese government's actions were legal and did not violate the basic human rights of these individuals.

    Soviet representative Kislenko then spoke, suggesting a discussion of the substance of the petition. He pointed out that the Japanese government's actions violated the Potsdam Proclamation and basic human rights. Kislenko insisted on rescinding the Japanese government's illegal decision. However, Sebald refused to continue the discussion of the petition and hastily adjourned the meeting.

    苏联代表在盟国对日委员会上
    提出讨论日本国会议员请愿书
    坚持取消吉田政府迫害日共领袖的非法决定
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社东京十二日讯：苏联出席盟国对日委员会代表基斯连科，于十月十日在该委员会会议上提出一群日本国会议员关于非法逮捕八名日本共产党党员——其中有三个国会议员——并禁止他们从事政治活动的请愿书。这种非法的迫害是日本当局在李奇微总部认可下执行的。苏联代表基斯连科支持这个请愿书，建议日本政府取消这个非法决定，并恢复上述人员从事政治活动的权利。
    美国代表赛鲍尔表示完全赞同日本政府的非法措施，并诽谤说共产党人从事破坏活动。他承认日本政府之采取这种行动曾得到李奇微总部有关部门的认可。
    但是赛鲍尔避不讨论这个请愿书的实质，企图使对这个请愿书的讨论变成对盟国对日委员会的权利这样一个仅仅是程序问题的讨论。
    不列颠联邦代表霍吉逊也企图使对这个请愿书的讨论变成对程序问题的讨论。霍吉逊说日本政府的行动是合法的，并没有破坏这些人的基本人权。
    苏联代表基斯连科接着发言，建议讨论这个请愿书的实质。他指出日本政府的行动破坏了波茨坦公告和基本人权。基斯连科坚持取消日本政府的非法决定。但是赛鲍尔拒绝继续讨论这个请愿书，赶紧宣布休会。
