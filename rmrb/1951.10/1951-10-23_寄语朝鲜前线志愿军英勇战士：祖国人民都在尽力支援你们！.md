    Message to the heroic volunteer soldiers on the Korean Front:
    The people of the motherland are doing their best to support you!
    Volunteer Army revolutionary disabled soldiers returning to Western Sichuan
    Report to comrades on the care of the people of the motherland
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st] Two hundred and six revolutionary disabled soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army studying at the Western Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School wrote a letter to their volunteer comrades on the Korean front on the eve of the first anniversary of the Volunteer Army's participation in the war, reporting on their experiences after returning to the motherland. The letter is as follows: Dear comrades:
    From the day we were wounded and returned to the motherland, our hearts have never left you for a moment. Every time we see news of your victories in the newspaper, we want to write to congratulate you.
    Comrades: When the ambulance carrying us entered the first railway station in the motherland, the local people, even old men in their sixties and seventies, braved the heavy snow to crowd onto the train, vying to carry the stretchers. In the hospital, many young students competed to donate blood for us. Under the round-the-clock care of doctors and nurses, our wounds healed quickly. Comrade Li Mingqing, whose eyes were injured by shrapnel, also regained his sight. People came to visit us every day. Letters of sympathy and gifts piled up on our tables. We hadn't even finished eating all the eggs when we were discharged from the hospital.
    When we returned to our hometown of Western Sichuan from the Northeast, we were warmly welcomed by our compatriots along the way. Everyone called us "the most beloved people." Chairman Mao heard that we were passing through Fengtai Railway Station and specially sent someone to visit us. Workers at the railway station discovered that we were Volunteer Army soldiers returning home to recuperate and immediately sent a large pile of apples.
    When we returned to Western Sichuan, we saw that the people of our hometown had already stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party. This year, the Chengdu Plain also saw a bumper harvest, with a general increase of 10% compared to last year. The lives of the farmers are getting better day by day. Our families have received special treatment. Our comrades Li Mingqing, Shi Hongyu, and six others participated in the Western Sichuan People's Administrative Office's comfort delegation to the families of martyrs and soldiers in August this year, visiting our families in Mianyang and 26 other counties. They saw that the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers were respected and cared for by the government and the people. In the homes of the martyrs' and soldiers' families, every household has a plaque of honor, and gifts are sent to comfort them during festivals. In the past year or so, the Western Sichuan Administrative Office has successively issued 1.33 million catties of preferential grain and more than 200 million yuan in RMB to needy families of martyrs and soldiers, and solved the employment problem for more than 1,900 families of martyrs and soldiers. Every village in the region has a fixed farming team, and this year they have helped the families of martyrs and soldiers who lack labor to cultivate more than 77,000 mu of land. The harvests of some families of martyrs and soldiers are even better than those of ordinary farmers. Yang Xiangui, a comrade who is still fighting on the front lines in Korea, has a good life at home. His family, both adults and children, have all made new clothes this year, and his younger brother, who couldn't afford to go to school before, has now been sent to school by the People's Government.
    Comrades, we see that everyone in the motherland is supporting you. Whether in the cities or the countryside, people have universally formulated patriotic pledges to increase production and donate. People are saying, "Send airplanes and cannons to the Volunteer Army earlier, and eliminate more American devils!"
    Now, we have been studying at the Western Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School for more than a month, and we are living very well. Many comrades who were originally illiterate can now recognize one or two hundred characters. Comrade Yang Guangming, whose right hand was injured, can now write with his left hand. Everyone says, "Although our bodies are disabled, our minds are not. We must learn skills to serve our great motherland."
    Comrades: Bravely strike the invaders, we will always stand with you!
    Yunnan Working Team of the Comfort Group to Korea Letter to the Volunteer Army
    Relay the determination of the border people of the motherland to support the front lines
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 21st] The report work of the Yunnan Working Team of the Southwest Branch of the Chinese People's Comfort Group to Korea in Yunnan has now been largely completed. On the eve of the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war, the team wrote a letter to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, reporting on the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement by the brotherly ethnic groups in the border areas of the motherland. The letter said:
    After we left you, we brought your heroic deeds to Yunnan Province, the southwestern border of the motherland, and have been conducting a tour of reports to the people of all ethnic groups for two months. Now, except for a part of the team members who are still continuing to report in the Pu'er area, the reporting work in other areas has basically ended. On the occasion of the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war, we will report to you the situation of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas of the motherland supporting you:
    The heinous crimes of American imperialism in Yunnan during the War of Resistance Against Japan have left an indelible hatred in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan. When the Shan Tou ethnic people heard that the houses in Korea were burned down, they remembered the painful scene of eighteen villages being burned down by the American devils in one breath. When the Bo (Thai), Lisu, and Mosuo people heard that Korean women were raped, murdered, and looted, they remembered the blood debts left by the American devils in Mangshi, Zhefang, the Nujiang and Lancang River basins, and Lijiang. They feel the suffering of the Korean people today as if it were their own.
    After listening to the reports of the Volunteer Army's returning representatives and the Comfort Group to Korea, the people of all ethnic groups said: Volunteer Army soldiers are fighting the American devils on the Korean front, defending the gate of the motherland, and we, the people of all ethnic groups, must unite to guard the back door of the motherland. They actively participated in the bandit suppression work. The self-defense armed forces composed of people of all ethnic groups cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to pursue and suppress the remaining bandits fleeing on the border line, and a large number of bandit suppression models emerged in the battles. During the rainy season this year, in order to solve the problem of food shortage caused by traffic difficulties for the border defense troops, the Shan Tou ethnic people in the Baoshan area mobilized thousands of people, broke the habit of not going down the mountain during the rainy season, and transported 280,000 catties of grain. The Sara (i.e., missionaries) of the Shan Tou ethnic group heard that the People's Liberation Army was coming to suppress bandits and automatically paid for the construction of a bridge. They said: Repairing the bridge and suppressing the bandits is resisting America and aiding Korea. With the close cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups and the People's Liberation Army, the border defense of the motherland has become more consolidated.
    The families of the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army are generally loved and helped by the people of all ethnic groups. In Tengchong County, the people of all ethnic groups have helped the military families with more than 4,490 workdays, collected more than 13,500 catties of grain and more than 30 cattle and horses, and provided preferential treatment to military families with difficult lives. In addition to allocating grain, rice, and cloth, Lianghe also helped the military families organize a production mutual aid group including 200 people. The people of all ethnic groups in Changning, Tengchong, Baoshan and other counties have separately entertained the military families during festivals.
    Because the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas have been oppressed by the reactionary rulers for a long time, their lives are generally relatively hard, but they also actively participated in the movement to donate airplanes and cannons. They used the firewood they chopped, the straw mats they wove, and the mushrooms they picked to exchange for money to donate. The Hui people in Yizhuo Township, Huize County, decided to donate 15 shi of corn in half a year, which is a considerable number in the local area. Twenty-five Yi villages in Yao'an County have all made a half-year donation plan. The people of all ethnic groups issued a common oath to the Volunteer Army: "We are your reserve team, your family's helper farming team, and your logistics team." The people of all ethnic groups instructed us to tell you: they will support you with all their strength until the day of victory in the Resist America, Aid Korea War.

    Revolutionary Martyr Dong Cunrui's Father Writes a Letter
    Hoping that the Volunteer Soldiers Will Make Greater Contributions
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] On the eve of the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war, Dong Quan, father of the famous combat hero and revolutionary martyr Dong Cunrui, wrote a letter of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The original text is as follows: Brave Volunteer Army comrades - my dear children:
    I am Dong Cunrui's father, people unanimously call me Uncle Dong. October 25th is the first anniversary of your participation in the war, I have a lot to say to you, but even with a thousand words, I can't express my meaning, I can't express the respect and love of the people in the rear for you!
    Dear children! Whenever I think of my son Cunrui, I think of you. I am honored and proud to have such a son; I and the broad masses of the people of our motherland are also honored and proud to have you, these heroic children. In the past year, you have stood on the front line of the motherland's national defense, severely attacking the American devils, and making great contributions to the motherland's security and world peace! The people of the motherland call you "the most beloved people," "honorable people," and call you "the glorious flower of the motherland." The people of China and the world are cheering for you!
    I tell you: The families of our revolutionary soldiers have become the most respected people in the country. Like me, an old rough man, Chairman Mao invited me to Beijing to watch the ceremony and visit the Tianjin Materials Exchange Exhibition during the National Day this year. No matter where I went, when people heard that I was Dong Cunrui's father, they surrounded me, lifted me up, asked this and that, and asked me to give speeches, broadcast, and asked me to sign my name. I always think, where did our glory come from? Isn't it all because of Cunrui, because of your heroic fighting? Everyone in the motherland has entrusted their hot hearts to you!
    Children! I also want to tell you: This time I met our Chairman Mao, he is very strong, this is really a blessing for everyone. We also visited many factories during this trip to Beijing. In the steel plant, I saw molten iron flowing out of the "red furnace" and turning into piles of steel. In those spinning mills, the female workers alone manage dozens of spindles. Also, those state farms that can't be seen at a glance, all use machines for farming: tractors, harvesters, weeding machines, machines are really useful, one machine can do the work of many people. When I visited the Tianjin Materials Exchange Exhibition, I saw local products and specialties from all over the country, really countless treasures. When I got home, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep for several nights, I always thought, such a motherland, we really should risk our lives to defend her! With such rich treasures, plus our worker elder brothers, farmer brothers and the people of the whole country producing and building with all their might, in ten or eight years, we will definitely be able to live a happy life like our Soviet elder brothers. Our countryside must also use machine production and turn on electric lights!
    Dear children, I know that you are all good brothers of Cunrui, you have made thousands of contributions for the motherland, I think you will make greater contributions, and the people in the rear are also working hard to support you. Just talking about our Chahar South District, even in such a big disaster, people are still working hard, weaving baskets and baskets to donate money to buy airplanes, now the whole district has completed the "Dong Cunrui" plane, as a gift for your first year abroad, I hope you will hit the American devils even harder!
            Dong Quanzhong, Nanshanpu Village, Huailai County, Chahar Province
                                October 22nd

    寄语朝鲜前线志愿军英勇战士：
    祖国人民都在尽力支援你们！
    回川西的志愿军革命残废军人
    向战友们报告祖国人民的关怀
    【新华社成都二十一日电】现在川西革命残废军人学校学习的二百零六名中国人民志愿军革命残废军人，在志愿军出国作战一周年纪念日前夕写信给朝鲜前线的志愿军战友，报告回祖国后的见闻。信如下：亲爱的战友们：
    从我们负伤回祖国的那一天起，我们的心就没有一刻离开过你们。当我们每次从报上看到你们打胜仗的消息，我们就想写信向你们祝贺。
    战友们：当载着我们的卫生车开进祖国的第一个火车站时，当地的人民群众，连六七十岁的老大爷都冒着大雪拥上火车，抢着抬担架。在医院里，许多青年学生争着为我们输血。我们在医生护士们日夜照护下，伤口很快就治好了。李明清同志被炮弹打伤的眼睛，也重见了光明。每天都有人来慰问我们。慰问信、慰劳品在我们的桌子上堆满了。我们出院时，鸡蛋还没有吃完哩。
    我们从东北回川西老家的时候，一路上又受到同胞们的热烈欢迎。大家都说我们是“最可爱的人”。毛主席听说我们路过丰台车站，特地派人来慰问我们。火车站的工人同志发现我们是归国养伤的志愿军，马上就送来大堆的苹果。
    我们回到川西，看到家乡的人民在共产党领导下已经翻了身。今年成都平原又喜逢丰收，比去年普遍增产一成。农民的日子一天比一天好过了。我们的家属特别受到优待。我们的李明清、石洪玉等六位同志，在今年八月间参加了川西人民行政公署组织的烈军属慰问团，到绵阳等二十七个县慰问我们的家属。他们看到革命烈士家属和革命军人家属们受到政府和人民的尊敬与照顾。在烈属、军属家里，家家挂上光荣匾，逢年过节，都有人送礼物慰劳。一年多来，川西行署曾先后发给有困难的烈属、军属优待粮一百三十三万斤，人民币二亿多元，并解决了一千九百多名烈属、军属的就业问题。全区各村都有固定包耕的代耕队，今年共帮助缺乏劳动力的烈属和军属耕种了七万七千多亩土地。有些烈属、军属的代耕田，收成比普通农民还好。现在还在朝鲜前线作战的杨先贵同志家里，生活过得很好。他家大人娃娃今年都做了新衣服，从前没钱读书的小弟弟，现在已由人民政府送去上学了。
    战友们，我们看到祖国的每个人都在支援着你们。无论城市和农村，人们普遍订出了增产捐献的爱国公约。人们都说：“早点把飞机、大炮送给志愿军，把美国鬼子消灭更多一些吧。”
    现在，我们已经在川西革命残废军人学校学习了一个多月，穿的吃的住的都很好。许多原来不识字的同志，现在都能认识一、二百字了。右手打坏的杨光明同志现在已能用左手写字了。大家都说：“我们的身体虽然残废了，但思想并没有残废，一定要学会本领，为我们伟大的祖国服务。”
    战友们：勇敢地打击侵略者吧，我们永远和你们站在一起！
    赴朝慰问团云南工作队函志愿军
    转达祖国边疆人民支援前线决心
    【新华社昆明二十一日电】中国人民赴朝慰问团西南分团云南工作队在云南的传达报告工作现已大体结束，该团特在中国人民志愿军出国作战周年纪念日前夕写信给中国人民志愿军指战员，报告祖国边疆各兄弟民族开展抗美援朝运动的情况。信上说：
    我们离别了你们之后，带着你们的英雄事迹来到祖国西南边疆的云南省，向各兄弟民族人民进行巡回传达，已有两个月了。现在除一部分团员还在普洱区继续传达外，其他各区传达工作已基本结束。趁此中国人民志愿军出国作战周年纪念日来临之际，仅将祖国边疆各民族人民支援你们的情况报告于后：
    美帝国主义在抗日战争时期在云南的滔天罪行，留给云南各民族人民以不可磨灭的仇恨。山头族人民听到朝鲜房屋被烧毁，就想起他们曾被美国鬼子一气烧掉十八个村寨的悲痛景象。僰（泰）族、傈僳族和摩些族人民听到朝鲜妇女被奸淫、杀掳，就想起美国鬼子在芒市、遮放和怒江、澜沧江流域以及丽江留下的血债。他们对朝鲜人民今日的苦难，感同身受。
    各民族人民在听了志愿军归国代表和赴朝慰问团的报告后，纷纷表示：志愿军战士在朝鲜前线打击美国鬼子，保卫祖国的大门，我们各民族人民要团结一致把守好祖国的后门。他们积极地参加剿匪工作。各民族人民组成的自卫武装配合人民解放军追剿流窜于国境线上的残余土匪，在战斗中涌现出大批的剿匪模范。今年雨季中，为解决边防部队因交通困难而发生的缺粮问题，保山专区山头族人民曾动员了几千人，破除雨季不下山的习惯，运送了二十八万斤粮食。山头族的撒拉（即传教士）听说解放军要来剿匪，自动出钱修好了一座桥。他们说：修好桥，剿完匪，就是抗美援朝了。祖国的边防，在各民族人民与解放军亲密合作下，已经更加巩固了。
    志愿军和人民解放军的家属普遍受到各民族人民的爱戴和帮助。腾冲县各族人民曾替军属助耕四千四百九十多工，凑积粮食一万三千五百斤和牛马三十多匹，优抚生活困难的军属。梁河除拨发谷米、布匹外，还帮助军属组织了包括二百人的生产互助组。昌宁、腾冲、保山等县各族人民，在逢年过节时都曾分别欢宴军属们。
    边疆各民族人民由于过去长期遭受反动统治者的压迫，生活一般比较苦，但他们也热烈地参加了捐献飞机大炮运动。他们用自己砍的柴、织的草席、采的菌子等换得钱来捐献。会泽县以濯乡回族人民决定半年捐献十五石包谷，这在当地是一个不小的数字。姚安县二十五个彝族聚居村寨都订出了半年捐献计划。各民族人民对志愿军发出共同的誓言：“我们是你们的后备队，是你们的家庭助耕队，也是你们的后勤队。”各民族人民嘱咐我们转告你们：他们将以所有的力量支援你们，一直到抗美援朝战争胜利日为止。
    革命烈士董存瑞的父亲写信
    希望志愿军战士立更大功劳
    【新华社张家口二十二日电】在中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年的前夕，著名的战斗英雄、革命烈士董存瑞的父亲董全忠写信慰问中国人民志愿军。原文如下：英勇的志愿军同志们——我的亲爱的孩子们：
    我是董存瑞的父亲，人们都一致称我董大伯。十月二十五日是你们出国作战的一周年，我有许多话想向你们说，可是纵有千言万语，也说不尽我的意思，说不尽后方的人们对你们那股尊敬、热爱的劲儿！
    亲爱的孩子们！每当我想起我那存瑞儿子，我就想起了你们，我为我有这样一个儿子感到光荣和骄傲；我和咱们祖国的广大人民，也因有你们这些英勇的子弟感到光荣和骄傲。一年来，你们站在祖国国防的最前线，狠狠地打击着美国鬼子，为祖国安全、为世界和平立下了多大的功劳呀！祖国人民都把你们称做“最可爱的人”、“荣誉的人”，叫你们做“祖国的光荣之花”，全中国、全世界的人民都在向你们欢呼啊！
    我告诉你们：咱们这些革命军人的家属，已经成为全国最受尊敬的人。就像我这样一个老粗，在今年国庆节的时候，毛主席还请咱到北京去观礼，到天津参观物资交流展览会。不管到了什么地方，人们一听说我是董存瑞的父亲，就把我围起来，抬起来，问这问那，还请我演讲，广播，要求我签名。我老是想，咱们这份儿光荣打那来的呢？这不全是因为存瑞、因为你们英勇战斗换来的吗？祖国的每一个人，都把他们那一颗热辣辣的心，全托给了你们啦！
    孩子们！我还要告诉你们：这次我见到了咱们毛主席，他的身体很壮实，这真是咱们大家的福气。我们这次到北京观礼还参观了许多工厂。在炼钢厂，我看见铁汁从“红炉”里流出来，变成了成堆的钢。那些纺纱厂，女工们一个人就管着几十个纱锭。还有，那些一眼看不到边的国家农场，种地用的全是机器：拖拉机、收割机、锄草机，机器真顶事，一个机器可顶很多人干活。在天津参观物资交流展览大会的时候，我又看到了全国各地的土产、特产，真是数不清的宝贝。回到家里，我简直兴奋得几夜也睡不着觉，我一直想，这样的祖国，真是应该拚上命保卫住她！这么丰富的宝藏，再加上咱们工人老大哥、农民兄弟和全国人民一个劲儿的生产、建设，过不上十年八年，咱们一定也能过上像苏联老大哥那样幸福的生活。咱们的农村，一定也要用机器生产，点上电灯！
    亲爱的孩子们，我知道，你们都是存瑞的好兄弟，你们为了祖国，已经立下了千万个功劳，我想着你们还会立更大的功劳，后方的人民也都在用力支援你们。就光说我们察南专区吧，这样大的灾荒，人们还是一股劲的干，编筐编篓也要献钱买飞机，现在全专区已完成了“董存瑞号”飞机，当做对你们出国一年的礼物，希望你们更狠狠地打击美国鬼子！
