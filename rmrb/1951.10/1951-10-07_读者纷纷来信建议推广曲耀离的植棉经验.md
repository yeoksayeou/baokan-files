    Readers Write in to Suggest Promoting Qu Yaoli's Cotton Planting Experience
    To the Editors:
    We read the news in the People's Daily on September 23rd about Qu Yaoli, a cotton planting model from Shanxi, writing to Chairman Mao to report his bumper harvest achievements. The news stated that Qu Yaoli's twenty mu of cotton fields could produce an average of 790 jin per mu, with two mu producing over 830 jin per mu. We were very excited when we read this letter. Xiao County is also a cotton planting area. In the past, due to the reactionary government's destruction of domestic cotton, cotton prices were extremely low, and cotton farmers had very low morale, so there was no talk of research or improvement. After liberation, the farmers' enthusiasm for production is very high, and they want us to write to the newspaper, hoping the newspaper will introduce Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience. We hope you will satisfy this request as much as possible.

    To the Editors:
    I was very happy to read in the newspaper that Qu Yaoli produced more than 700 jin of cotton per mu this year. However, some classmates doubt whether the area of Qu Yaoli's cotton field per mu is larger than ordinary cotton fields? Some classmates also said that the People's Daily published this news, so it must be correct. So we started a discussion. Finally, everyone unanimously asked the newspaper to introduce Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience and promote it throughout the country.

    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published the news that Qu Yaoli, a cotton planting model from Shanxi, produced 790 jin of cotton per mu, we have successively received letters from readers; most of these letters expressed excitement about Qu Yaoli's achievements, and a few expressed doubts. The two letters published here are more representative. Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience should indeed be promoted. We are investigating and interviewing, and will publish it soon.

### 读者纷纷来信建议推广曲耀离的植棉经验

专栏：读者来信

    读者纷纷来信建议推广曲耀离的植棉经验编辑同志：
    九月二十三日人民日报刊载了山西植棉模范曲耀离上书毛主席报告丰产成绩的消息，这个消息里说：曲耀离的二十亩棉田，平均可产七百九十斤，其中有二亩，每亩可产八百三十斤以上。我们看了这封信，真是兴奋。我们萧县也是植棉地区，过去由于反动政府摧残国棉，致棉价极低；棉农生产情绪很低，当然谈不到研究、改进了。解放后，农民生产情绪很高，都要我们写信给报社，希望报社介绍曲耀离的植棉经验，希望你们尽量满足这个要求。
                皖北萧县农场孟庆朴、刘纪韬编辑同志：
    我看了报上登载的曲耀离今年每亩棉田产棉七百多斤的消息，非常高兴。但是，有的同学怀疑曲耀离一亩棉田的面积，是否会比普通的棉田大一些？有的同学又说，人民日报登了这个消息，一定不会错。于是我们就展开了讨论。最后，大家一致要求报社把曲耀离的植棉经验介绍出来，推广到全国去。北京市工农速成中学    张益民
    编者按：本报发表了山西植棉模范曲耀离一亩棉田产棉七百九十斤的消息后，即陆续收到一些读者来信；这些信的大部分对曲耀离的成就表示兴奋，少数表示怀疑。这里发表的这两封信，是比较有代表性的。曲耀离的植棉经验确是应该推广的，我们正在调查和采访，不久就可发表。
