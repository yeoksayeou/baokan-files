Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: According to TASS news from New York: After holding meetings on the 16th and 17th, the United Nations Security Council adjourned on the 18th. On the 19th, it held a meeting to continue discussing the so-called complaint case filed by the British government regarding the nationalization of Iranian oil. Disregarding the repeated just arguments of the Soviet representative that the Security Council cannot discuss this issue, other representatives in the Security Council passed the French representative's suggestion to postpone the debate on the British proposal. The French representative suggested waiting for the International Court of Justice to make a decision on whether it has the right to intervene in the dispute between Iran and the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company before proceeding with the debate.

    The Iranian delegation did not participate in this meeting. Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh's assistant Fatemi explained to the press representatives on October 18 that the Iranian delegation no longer needed to attend the Security Council because "our work there has come to an end." Mossadegh made a statement at the Security Council meeting on the 17th, exposing the absurdity of the British representative Jebb's claim that Iran had obtained "profits" due to the operation of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. He pointed out that in 1950 alone, the company made a profit of nearly 200 million pounds, almost twice the total royalties the company paid to Iran for mining rights in the past 50 years.

    The actions of the U.S. representative Austin in the Security Council meetings in recent days have clearly exposed the ugly face of the United States regarding the nationalization of Iranian oil. He initially supported Britain in asking the Security Council to discuss Britain's so-called complaint against Iran, and then supported the amendments proposed by the Indian and Yugoslav delegations, attempting to classify the dispute between Iran and the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company as an "international" issue. Later, he supported the French proposal to postpone the debate, demonstrating the attempt of the United States and Britain to continue to interfere in Iran's internal affairs.

    Soviet representative Tsarapkin opposed including the British proposal or other similar "amendments" on the agenda at the meeting on the 16th. At the meeting on the 19th, he again solemnly opposed including the French proposal on the agenda, and pointed out that the Security Council's consideration of this issue constituted interference in Iran's internal affairs and a serious violation of the sovereignty of the Iranian people. Tsarapkin recounted that before this issue was included on the agenda, the Soviet delegation further stated that the Soviet delegation considered it impermissible for the Security Council to discuss this issue.

    The French proposal passed with eight votes. The Soviet representative voted against it. The representatives of Yugoslavia and Britain abstained.

    Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: The atrocities of the British occupying forces in the Suez Canal Zone have aroused great indignation among the Egyptian people. On the 18th, the people of Cairo, Alexandria and other cities continued to hold anti-imperialist demonstrations. According to a TASS report: Cairo newspapers reported that although the Egyptian government prohibited demonstrations, the people in many Egyptian cities still launched mass actions to resist British imperialism. In Cairo, up to 10,000 people participated in the demonstration. The demonstrators held a rally. Speakers at the meeting exposed the crimes committed by British imperialism against the peaceful residents of the Suez Canal Zone. At the end of the conference, the students demanded the rejection of any alliance with the imperialist bloc, the severance of all relations with Britain, the nationalization of all British companies in Egypt, and the immediate release of all political prisoners. In Alexandria, 2,000 students and workers participated in the demonstration. Police injured several people while trying to disperse the crowd.

    Egyptian newspapers have reported the atrocities of the British military and called on the people to support the struggle for the liberation of Egypt. Al-Ahram newspaper reported that women's movement leaders Ceza Nabraoui and Fatima Niyazi Rachid and others have established a preparatory committee for the National Women's Anti-British Occupation Army Movement.

    安理会决定延期辩论英对伊朗的“控诉案”
    苏联代表坚持安理会不能干涉伊朗内政
    埃及各地人民继续示威抗议英军暴行
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：联合国安全理事会在十六、十七两日举行会议之后，十八日休会一天，十九日举行会议，继续讨论英国政府对于伊朗石油国有化所提出的所谓控诉案。安全理事会中的其他代表不顾苏联代表一再阐述的安全理事会不能讨论这个问题的正义主张，通过了法国代表所提出的延期辩论英国提案的建议。法国代表建议等待国际法院作出关于是否有权过问伊朗和前英伊石油公司的争端的决定后再进行辩论。
    伊朗代表团未参加这次会议。伊朗总理摩萨台的助理法特米在十月十八日向报界代表解释说，伊朗代表团已毋须再出席安理会，因为“我们在那里的工作已告结束”。摩萨台曾在十七日的安全理事会会议中发表声明，揭穿英国代表杰伯所谓伊朗因前英伊石油公司的开办而获得“利润”的说法的荒谬。他指出：单在一九五零年，该公司即获利近两亿英镑，几为该公司五十年来所付给伊朗的矿区使用费总数的两倍。
    美国代表奥斯汀在几天来的安理会会议中的行动，清楚地暴露了美国对于伊朗石油国有化问题的狰狞面目。他最初支持英国，要安全理事会讨论英国对伊朗的所谓控诉案，继而又支持印度和南斯拉夫代表团所提的修正案，企图把伊朗和前英伊石油公司的争端列为“国际”问题，后来又支持法国所提出来的延期辩论提案，表现了美英要继续干涉伊朗内政的企图。
    苏联代表查拉普金在十六日的会议中反对把英国提案或其他性质类似的“修正案”列入议程。在十九日的会议中，他又严正地反对把法国提案列入议程，并指出：安全理事会考虑这个问题，就构成了干涉伊朗内政及严重侵犯伊朗人民的主权的行为。查拉普金追述说，苏联代表团在这个问题列入议程前曾进一步声明，苏联代表团认为安理会讨论这个问题是不能容许的。
    法国提案以八票通过。苏联代表投票反对。南斯拉夫和英国代表弃权。
    【新华社二十日讯】英国占领军在苏彝士运河区的暴行，已激起埃及人民的莫大愤慨。十八日，开罗、亚历山大等城市的人民继续举行反帝示威游行。据塔斯社讯：开罗各报报道：虽然埃及政府禁止游行示威，但埃及许多城市的人民仍展开群众性的反抗英帝国主义的行动。在开罗，参加示威的达一万人。示威者曾举行集会。在会上演说的人揭露了英帝国主义对苏彝士运河区和平居民所犯下的罪行。大会终结时，学生们要求拒绝和帝国主义集团建立任何联盟，并要求断绝和英国的一切关系，把英国在埃及所有的公司收归国有，立即释放全体政治犯。亚历山大有二千学生和工人参加了示威。警察因为试图驱散群众而使数人受伤。
    埃及各报都报道了英军的暴行，并号召人民支持争取埃及解放的斗争。埃及人报报道：妇女运动领袖塞萨·纳布拉薇、法齐玛·尼?特·拉希德等人已成立全国妇女抗英占领军运动筹备委员会。
