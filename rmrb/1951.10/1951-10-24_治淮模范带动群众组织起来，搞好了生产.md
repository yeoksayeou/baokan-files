    Model of Harnessing the Huai River Leads the Masses to Organize and Improve Production
    I am from Sangluo Village, Sihong County, Suxian Special District, northern Anhui. My family has seven people, and before the land reform, we only had nine mu of land. I worked as a hired laborer at the age of fourteen, living a slave-like life for five years. After the land reform, my family was allocated twenty-six mu of land, bringing our total to thirty-five mu, and we no longer had to worry about making ends meet.
    I worked actively in the Huai River harnessing project last winter and this spring, winning the "Red Flag" six times and being recognized as a first-class model worker. In early July this year, at the Special District Labor Model Conference, I was again recognized as a special-class Huai River harnessing model worker and received a prize. The Special District leaders personally presented me with a flower and encouraged me to improve production after returning to the village. I was truly moved. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to turn over a new leaf, I wouldn't have this honor today!
    Our village has a total of one hundred and twenty households, four hundred and eighty-two people, and one thousand eight hundred and twenty mu of land, one-third of which is lake land. During this year's summer planting and hoeing season, continuous rain flooded most of the seedlings in the lake land, and most of the seedlings in the upland fields were also damaged by wind and rain, affecting the production morale of the masses. I discussed solutions with the village cadres, on the one hand, publicizing production policies to the masses, pointing out various avenues for production; on the other hand, organizing and leading 278 people to dig six drainage ditches in three days, saving 1,246 mu of seedlings. Then, I and Zheng Peigong and other seven households with sixteen people first organized a mutual aid production team. The team established a system, rationally used labor, implemented work assessment and work points, and launched competition between individuals. The team also organized a small nursery, with two elderly people responsible for taking care of the children, freeing up all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers to participate in production. Because the facts demonstrated the power of organization, it motivated the entire village to organize forty-five mutual aid teams. Their production morale was greatly improved. Teams also challenged each other, launching "Red Flag" competitions and improving production.
    Now the entire village has achieved a situation where no one is idle, and every household has established production plans and patriotic covenants. Due to good production, we have already paid all 9,470 jin of public grain due for the summer requisition, and have also donated 5.6 million yuan in Renminbi to buy airplanes and cannons.
    Our village's contribution to the country is still not large, and we must work even harder to produce more.

    治淮模范带动群众组织起来，搞好了生产
    我是皖北宿县专区泗洪县桑骆村人。我家七口人，土地改革以前只有九亩地。我十四岁上就给人当雇工，过了五年奴隶般的生活。土地改革以后，我家分得二十六亩地，连前共有三十五亩，日子才不愁了。
    我在去冬今春治淮工作中积极劳动，曾六次夺得“红旗”，被评为一等模范。今年七月初，在专区劳动模范大会上，我又被评为特等治淮模范，得到了奖品。专区首长还亲自给我戴花，鼓励我回村后要搞好生产。我真是十分感动，要不是共产党、毛主席领导我们翻身，我那有今天这份光荣！
    我们村里共有一百二十户，四百八十二人，一千八百二十亩地，其中三分之一是湖地。今年夏种夏锄时，阴雨连绵，湖地禾苗大部被淹，高地田苗也大部受到风雨摧残，群众生产情绪受到影响。我就和村干部研究办法，一面向群众宣传生产政策，指出各种生产门路；一面组织和领导群众二百七十八人，在三天内挖了六道水沟，救出禾苗一千二百四十六亩。接着我和郑培功等七户十六人首先组织生产互助组，组内定出了制度，合理地使用劳动力，实行评工计工，发动个人之间的竞赛。组内还组织了一个小小托儿所，由二位老人负责看顾小孩，抽出全劳力、半劳力全部参加生产。因为用事实说明了组织起来力量大的道理，这样就带动全村群众组织了四十五个互助组。他们生产情绪大为提高。组与组间还相互挑战，展开了“红旗”竞赛，搞好了生产。
    现全村已做到无一闲人，家家户户订立了生产计划和爱国公约。由于生产搞得好，我们已把夏征应缴公粮九千四百七十斤全部缴齐，还捐献了五十六万元人民币买飞机大炮。
    我村对国家贡献还不大，我们一定还要更加努力生产。
