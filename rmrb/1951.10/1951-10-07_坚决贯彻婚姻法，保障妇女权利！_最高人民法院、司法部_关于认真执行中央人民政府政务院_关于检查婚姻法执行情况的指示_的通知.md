Notification from the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice Regarding the Conscientious Implementation of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Inspecting the Implementation of the Marriage Law"

To the Supreme People's Court Sub-branches and the Ministry of Justice of all Major Administrative Regions, the People's Court of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the People's Courts of all Provinces (Municipalities):

Since the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law, people's courts at all levels have achieved certain results in its implementation. However, many judicial organs still have common shortcomings, mainly: insufficient understanding of the political significance of implementing the Marriage Law and their serious responsibility in implementing the Marriage Law; failing to see themselves as a backbone force actively supporting women's just struggle against feudal bondage and abuse. They turn a blind eye to the many restrictions and interferences that many women face in love, marriage, and divorce. Even when bloody incidents of women being abused or murdered because of marriage issues occur repeatedly, they fail to take effective measures to stop the continuation of these acts of abuse.

Therefore, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has decided to issue "Instructions on Inspecting the Implementation of the Marriage Law," instructing people's governments at all levels to conscientiously and responsibly inspect and improve this work. Relevant central organs and groups plan to organize inspection teams to go to relevant areas for inspection, and the People's Daily will launch and carry out a publicity campaign on the implementation of the Marriage Law. In order to enable people's courts at all levels to better implement this instruction from the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, it is hoped that under the unified leadership of people's governments at all levels, they will work closely with relevant departments such as the Procuratorate, Public Security, Trade Unions, Youth League, Women's Federation, and farmers, and refer to the central government's methods of organizing inspection groups and carrying out publicity campaigns. Efforts should be made to carry out work through people's representative conferences. From now on, people's courts at all levels should regard themselves as the backbone force in the local area for implementing the Marriage Law and supporting women's just struggle against feudal bondage and abuse. Not only should they handle marriage cases in a timely and correct manner, but they should also actively and proactively handle marriage issues for the masses (such as circuit trials, regular visits to parties involved in handled marriage cases, etc.), and frequently use all possible means to organize various forces to carry out publicity and education work among the masses.

    坚决贯彻婚姻法，保障妇女权利！
    最高人民法院、司法部
    关于认真执行中央人民政府政务院“关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示”的通知
    各大行政区最高人民法院分院并司法部、内蒙古自治区人民法院并各省（市）人民法院：
    婚姻法颁布施行以来，各级人民法院在执行婚姻法上是有一定成绩的。但有不少司法机关还存在着普遍性缺点，主要的是：对贯彻婚姻法的政治意义和自己在贯彻婚姻法中的严重责任认识不够；未把自己看成是积极支持妇女反封建束缚和虐害正义斗争的骨干力量。对不少妇女在恋爱、结婚与离婚上受到许多的限制与干涉问题，不闻不问，甚至妇女因婚姻问题被虐杀或自杀的血案叠次发生，亦未采取有效措施，以终止虐杀事件的继续发生。
    为此，中央人民政府政务院决定发布“关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示”，责成各级人民政府认真负责检查与改进这一工作。中央有关机关团体拟即为此组织检查小组，分赴有关地区进行检查，同时，由人民日报发动与开展关于贯彻婚姻法的宣传运动。兹为使各级人民法院能很好地贯彻中央人民政府政务院这一指示，希即在各级人民政府统一领导下与检察、公安、工、青、妇、农等有关部门通力合作，参照中央的组织检查组和开展宣传运动的办法；并力求经过人民代表会议来进行工作。今后各级人民法院应把自己作为当地为贯彻婚姻法、支持妇女反封建束缚和虐害的正义斗争的骨干力量，不仅应及时而正确地处理婚姻案件，且应主动积极地为群众处理婚姻问题（如巡回审判，定期访问已处理之婚姻案件当事人等），并经常利用一切可能，组织各种力量向群众进行宣传教育工作。
