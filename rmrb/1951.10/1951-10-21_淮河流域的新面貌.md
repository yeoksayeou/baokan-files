    The New Face of the Huai River Basin
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Minsheng, Zhu Minxin
    This year's bumper harvest has brought a thriving new look to the Huai River Basin.
    For more than a decade, every summer and autumn, the people on both sides of the Huai River, looking at the overflowing floodwaters, the submerged crops, and the homes destroyed by the floods, were all in tears, preparing to flee the famine. However, now, as you enter any village on either bank of the Huai River in northern Anhui, you can see farmers busily building houses everywhere. You see peasant women sitting in front of their doors sewing new clothes, peasant children carrying their schoolbags to school, cattle and sheep grazing quietly in the fields, and flocks of ducks leisurely foraging in the ponds and roosters crowing loudly.
    The bumper harvest has driven away the bitter days of eating chaff and wild herbs for the people of the Huai River. In the past, during August and September, farmhouses ravaged by floods were in a state of "chimneys not smoking and iron pots rusting." Now, every farmer's home is full of wheat and sorghum. The farmers' bowls are no longer filled with "vegetable soup so thin you can see your reflection," but with "thin porridge and steamed buns in the morning and at noon, and noodles and soybean soup in the evening." Many farm families have enough grain from this year's harvest to last until next summer.
    After this year's bumper harvest, the first thing the Huai River farmers did was to build houses. Take Yingshang County for example, the Quanlou Township alone has recently built 270 new houses. In Liang'an Township, Fengtai County, more than 300 of the 500-plus houses destroyed last year have been rebuilt. This new situation of large-scale construction has brought booming business to mud workers and carpenters. Taking more than 20 carpenters in Hemiao Township, Shouxian County as an example, they had been out of work before the bumper harvest, but now they are busy, and before they finish the job at this house, contracts have already been signed for the next.
    Before the bumper harvest, many rural areas did not have a single draught cattle. Farmers used their shoulders to plow the fields and their hands to dig the land. Especially in the northern bank of the Huai River in northern Anhui, because of the frequent disasters year after year, a large number of draught cattle were often sold to other villages in the past. Since the bumper harvest this year, not only have the cattle within the territory not flowed out, but many farmers have also bought cattle back from outside. Suxian Prefecture has purchased nearly 120,000 head of livestock from the wheat harvest to the present. Farmers in Fengtai County, Fuyang Prefecture, purchased more than 5,500 head of draught cattle from other places through the introduction of the County People's Government Production Section alone. Fifteen farmers in Shangyuan Village, Shouxian County, who had been begging for food in other villages for many years, also bought five cattle together after this year's bumper harvest. They said confidently: Next year, every family in our village will be able to raise cattle, and then we won't have to pull the plow with people!
    After the bumper harvest, the lives of the Huai River farmers have greatly improved. Last year, farmers in this area rarely added clothes. In winter, they wore the relief cotton-padded clothes distributed by the People's Government, and in spring and summer, they took out the cotton and turned it into lined or unlined clothes. After this year's bumper harvest, many farmers have added new clothes. Wang Jianying's family of eight in Boweizi Village, Suxian County, added eight sets of unlined clothes this summer, and plans to add eight sets of cotton-padded clothes in winter. Li Dengrun's family of seven in Liudi Village, Shouxian County, planted 39 mu of land. His family had not bought an inch of cloth for more than two years. This year, they harvested 15 shi of wheat, and each member of the family sewed two to three new clothes. After the autumn harvest, they also plan to add a new cotton-padded jacket for each person. Li Dengrun happily tugged at the new clothes on his body and told reporters: "This is what Chairman Mao's call to harness the Huai River has brought me." Many farmers who could not get married in the past due to poverty have married new wives this year. A farmer in Yingshang County named Wang Deze, who is 30 years old this year, fell in love with a woman before liberation, but he never got married because he was wandering outside for many years. After the summer harvest this year, the two got married. Wang Deze happily told everyone he met: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's call to harness the Huai River, which allowed us to harvest crops, I would have been a bachelor all my life!"
    As the lives of farmers improved, they eagerly hoped that their children could receive education. Therefore, after the summer harvest, many schools have been newly opened in various places, and the number of students has also increased unprecedentedly. Take Shouxian County as an example: Before the bumper harvest, there were only 190 schools and 23,437 students in the county. Now, there are 441 schools and 40,189 students. Before the bumper harvest, Hemiao Township in the county had only one primary school with more than 150 students. After the bumper harvest, the number of students suddenly increased to 327, and one school could no longer accommodate them, so three branch schools were added. Chen Xianglan, an old man who had never entered the gate of a school, also sent his grandson to school this year. He said to his nine-year-old grandson Chen Hu: "Our family has been blind for generations. This year, Chairman Mao led the harnessing of the Huai River, and the land that has been flooded for many years has yielded a bumper harvest this year, so we can send you to school. You must learn to read well!"
    After the bumper harvest, the purchasing power of farmers has increased, and many towns in the Huai River Basin have therefore become unusually prosperous. Take Zhengyangguan as an example: This major town with a population of 20,000 was trapped in more than two meters of floodwater in 1950, and more than 7,000 houses were destroyed. After the flood, many factories closed down, shops closed their doors, and the market was very desolate for a while. The situation is very different now. Every day, from morning to night, many farmers gather at the doors of shops to buy what they need. Fabrics, general merchandise, and agricultural tools have become the best-selling goods. Yuji Cloth Shop's average monthly turnover was only 15 million yuan from January to March this year, but after the bumper harvest in July, the turnover suddenly increased to 310 million yuan, a difference of twenty times. Under such circumstances, the original cloth shops in the town were far from meeting the needs of the farmers, and new cloth shops are opening one after another. At present, the number of cloth shops in the town has increased from more than 20 to 45. The China Department Store Zhengyangguan Office's turnover in April this year was only 280 million yuan, while the turnover in August increased to 984 million yuan. The ten iron shops in the town that manufactured agricultural tools had no business after the flood. Now, these ten iron shops are rushing to manufacture agricultural tools day and night, but they still cannot meet the needs of the farmers. Many industrialists and businessmen said with joy: With the bumper harvest, the lives of the farmers have improved, and our business is also booming.

    淮河流域的新面貌
    新华社记者  于民生  朱敏信
    今年的丰收，使淮河流域呈现了一幅欣欣向荣的新面貌。
    十多年来，每当夏、秋两季，淮河两岸的人民望着漫天的大水，望着被淹的庄稼，望着给洪水毁坏了的家园，个个都含着眼泪，准备外出逃荒。然而，现在你走进皖北淮河两岸的任何一个村庄，到处可以看到正在忙着修盖房屋的农民。看到那些坐在门前缝着新衣服的农妇，背起书包上学校的农民子弟，在野外静静吃草的牛羊，以及在池塘里悠然寻食的鸭群和引颈高歌的雄鸡。
    丰收赶走了淮河人民吃糠咽菜的苦难日月。在往年的八、九月间，被洪水洗劫一空的农家，正是“烟囱不冒烟，铁锅生了锈”的时候。现在，每个农民家里都存着满仓的麦子秫秫（高粱）。农民的碗里已不再是“照得见人影儿的菜汤”，而是“早上、晌午稀饭馍，晚上面条黄豆汤”了。很多农家今年收得的粮食吃到明年夏季还有积余。
    今年丰收后，淮河农民的第一件事就是盖房子。就拿颍上县来说，仅全楼乡一个乡最近就新盖了二百七十间房子。凤台县梁安乡去年被冲毁的五百多间房子，已有三百多间重新盖起来。这种大兴土木的新情况，给泥水工人和木工工人带来兴隆的生意。以寿县合庙乡二十多个木工工人为例，在丰收前，他们一直没有活干，但现在他们忙起来了，这家的活还没做完，别家的合同就已经订好了。
    丰收以前，好多农村里没有一条耕牛，农民用双肩代替耕牛犁田，用两手刨地。特别是皖北的淮河北岸地区，因为年年闹灾，往年常有大批耕牛被出卖到外乡去，今年自从丰收以后，不仅境内的耕牛没有外流，许多农民还从外面买耕牛回来。宿县专区从麦收到现在买进的牲口已近十二万头。阜阳专区凤台县的农民，仅通过县人民政府生产科介绍到外地购买的耕牛就有五千五百多头。寿县上圆村十五户在外乡讨了多年饭的农民，今年丰收后也合伙买了五头牛，他们满怀信心地说：明年我们家家都能喂起牛了，到那时候就不要用人拉犁了！
    丰收后，淮河农民的生活大大改善了。去年一年，这一带的农民很少有添制衣服的。他们冬天穿的是人民政府发下的救济棉衣，到了春天和夏天就把棉花扒出来改成夹衣或单衣穿。今年丰收以后，很多农民都添了新衣服。宿县薄圩子村王剑英家八口人，今年夏季添制了八套单衣，到冬天还准备添八套棉衣。寿县刘帝村李登润家七口人，种了三十九亩地，他家有两年多没有买过一尺布，今年收了十五石麦子，全家每个人都缝了两件到三件新衣服，秋收以后，还准备每人添一身新棉袄。李登润高兴地扯着自己身上的新衣服告诉记者说：“这是毛主席号召治淮带给我的。”好多过去因贫穷不能结婚的农民，今年都娶了新媳妇。颍上县有个农民叫王德泽，今年三十岁了，他在解放前曾经爱上一个妇女，但因连年流浪在外，始终没有结婚，今年夏收后，他俩才结了婚。王德泽高兴地逢人便说：“要不是毛主席号召治淮，使俺收到庄稼，俺可要做一世的光条汉子了！”
    农民的生活改善了，他们迫切希望自己的子弟能受到教育。因此，夏收以后，各地都新开办了不少学校，学生人数也空前增加了。以寿县为例：丰收以前全县只有一百九十所学校，两万三千四百三十七个学生，现在，已经有四百四十一所学校，四万零一百八十九个学生了。该县的合庙乡丰收前只有一所小学，一百五十多个学生。丰收后，学生骤然增加到三百二十七人，一所学校已经容纳不下，又增加了三处分校。从来没有进过学校大门的陈相兰老大爷，今年也把孙子送到学校里去读书了。他对九岁的孙子陈湖说：“咱家作了几辈子睁眼瞎子了，今年毛主席领导治淮，多年被淹的地，今年丰收了，所以才能送你上学，你可要好好地认字啊！”
    丰收后，农民的购买力提高了，淮河流域的许多城镇也因此显得异常繁荣。以正阳关为例：这个有两万人口的重镇，在一九五○年陷在两公尺多深的洪水中，仅房屋被冲毁的就有七千多间。水灾之后，许多工厂倒闭了，商店关了门，市面上一时显得十分萧条冷落。现在的情况大大不同了，每天从早到晚，都有很多农民云集在商店门口，买他们所需要的东西。布匹、百货及农具等，成为销路最好的货色。裕记布庄在今年一月到三月，每月营业额平均仅一千五百万元，而丰收后的七月份，营业额便骤然增至三亿一千万元，前后相差达二十倍。在这样的情况下，镇上原有的布店远不能满足农民的需要，新的布店正在陆续开张营业。目前，全镇的布店已由原来的二十多家增加到四十五家。中国百货公司正阳关办事处，今年四月份的营业额仅二亿八千多万元，八月份营业额则增加到九亿八千四百多万元。镇上制造农具的十家铁店，水灾后一直没有生意作。现在这十家铁店日以继夜地赶造农具，也供应不上农民的需要。好多工商业家都喜笑颜开地说：丰收了，庄稼人的生活光景好了，我们的买卖也兴隆了。
