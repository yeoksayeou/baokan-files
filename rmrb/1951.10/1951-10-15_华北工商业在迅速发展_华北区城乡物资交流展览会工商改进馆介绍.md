Rapid Development of Industry and Commerce in North China
—Introduction to the Industrial and Commercial Improvement Hall of the North China Regional Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition
By our special correspondent Jia Huo

The materials exhibited in the Industrial and Commercial Improvement Hall of the North China Regional Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition indicate that since liberation, as a result of the people's government's implementation of the policy of considering both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, and providing assistance in various aspects, industry and commerce in North China have greatly developed and continue to develop. According to the industrial household statistics at the end of June 1951, Beijing increased by 74% compared to the end of 1950, Tianjin increased by 161% compared to the end of 1948, Baoding increased by 94% compared to the end of 1948, and Taiyuan increased by 439% compared to May 1949. Commercial households increased by 27% in Beijing compared to the end of 1948, 40% in Shijiazhuang compared to the end of 1948, 20% in Tianjin compared to the end of 1949, and 3.69 times in Taiyuan compared to April 1949. For many commodities, an unprecedented phenomenon of "no slack season during the off-season, and even busier during the peak season" has emerged this year.

Along with the increase in the number of industrial and commercial households, the number of workers employed has also increased. Comparing the end of June this year with the early period of 1949, Tianjin increased by 1.17 times, Beijing increased by 1.1 times, Baoding increased by 3.65 times, Taiyuan increased by 0.97 times, Zhangjiakou increased by 1.67 times, and Xinxiang increased by 29.31 times.

In state-owned and public-owned factories, due to the implementation of democratic management and the launch of production competitions, the workers' enthusiasm for production has been greatly stimulated, and both the quantity and quality of production have significantly improved. Taking the Tianjin Steel Plant of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry as an example, the output of steel ingots in 1951 will increase by 8.17 times compared to 1948, and the output of wire rod will increase by 11.72 times. The value of workers' production increased by 1.63 times in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter. In terms of product quality, the qualified rate of first-class steel ingots has reached 86.2%, exceeding the standard of 80%; the qualified rate of first-class wire rod has reached 89.4%, exceeding the standard of 75%. Production accidents decreased from 52 in the first quarter of last year to 17 in the second quarter of this year. Electricity consumption this year has also been reduced by half compared to 1949.

In private enterprises, due to the widespread establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings, the establishment of inspection and responsibility systems through labor-capital consultation meetings, the launch of rationalization proposal campaigns, and various competitions; the adjustment of wages and the implementation of labor protection regulations, production has also been rapidly developed. Taking Tianjin Hengyuan Cotton Mill as an example, as a result of the above-mentioned reforms, the output of yarn increased by 35% and the waste of yarn decreased by 53% in the two years and seven months after liberation. The factory's profits of over 1.2 billion yuan were used for production and construction.

On the basis of democratic reform, various factories have gradually established production contracts, contact contracts, and collective contracts, as well as handover systems, safety responsibility systems, statistical inspection systems, and production responsibility systems. These scientific systems further guarantee the smooth progress of production.

Particularly exciting is the great creative ability shown by the liberated working class. The inventions and creations of the working class in the past two years are too numerous to mention. Judging only from the exhibits in the Industrial and Commercial Improvement Hall, there are more than 70 kinds, including five-cylinder engines, trackless trams, high-speed diesel engines, calcium carbide gas engines, 500-line automatic telephone exchanges, paper machines that produce two sheets of paper at the same time, as well as photographic materials, chemical dyes, chemical instruments, medical light bulbs, graphite crucibles, and sesame sacks. The first domestically produced automobile has also been created.

Today, not only can these things be made domestically, but many of them have lower costs and higher quality than foreign goods. The non-powered eight-blade centrifugal separator manufactured by the Tianjin Industrial Bureau Machinery Factory can reduce the impurities contained in sesame seeds to one-thousandth, exceeding international standards. The chemical instruments manufactured by the Beijing Scientific Instrument Industry Cooperative, such as beakers, can not only guarantee that they will not break or crack when heated to 250 degrees Celsius and then immersed in cold water, but also the same 500 cubic centimeter beaker costs 50,000 yuan from foreign sources, while the domestic one only costs 6,000 yuan. Our domestically produced indigo fine is 5% higher in quality than the American product "140" color. The American product sells for about 8,000 catties of millet per box, while our domestically produced product only costs 7,000 catties. The "fire glass ring" in the tram motor commutator created by Huang Bojin, a worker at the Beijing Tram Factory, only costs 136,000 yuan, while the foreign product costs 500,000 yuan. ... These numerous facts have completely shattered the imperialists' shameless lies that the Chinese people have no creative ability, and have completely failed the imperialists' conspiracy to impose a "blockade" on us. The Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have no insurmountable difficulties.

In the past two years, in the continuous development of production, countless heroic and exemplary figures have emerged from the working class, becoming the banner for the progress of the working people. For example, Pan Changyou, a special-class labor model at the Tianjin Steel Plant, adopted advanced Soviet experience and hot-repaired open-hearth furnaces, which improved production and saved the people's wealth. Each hot repair can save 64 working days and more than 10 million catties of millet; he also proposed replacing the lime kiln with magnesia pipes, which can save 3,000 magnesia bricks each time, equivalent to 150,000 catties of millet. Zhang Shuyun, the female worker group leader of the middle packaging department of the Tianjin Hengda Tobacco Factory, analyzed and integrated the "corner covering method" of female worker Feng Wenzhen, the "lid covering method" of Yu Guilan, and the "boxing method" of Jiao Guizhi, plus her own "grabbing cigarette method," which improved the technology of the entire operation process of the middle packaging department, forming a complete set of operation methods—the "Zhang Shuyun Work Method," which is in line with the advanced Soviet "Kovalev Work Method." It is now being rapidly and widely promoted in Tianjin. In addition, there is also Hong Baoshun, a special-class labor model and engineer at the Tianjin Machine Factory, who created the country's first high-speed diesel engine, and Li Zhaozhen, a special-class model in the first sewing department of the Tianjin Clothing Factory, who led the masses to overcome various difficulties, complete military supply tasks on schedule, and improve the technical level of general workers. All these creations, inventions, and exemplary deeds have become a great force in promoting economic construction.

The Industrial and Commercial Improvement Hall not only exhibits the progress that has been achieved, but also exhibits the various shortcomings and bad habits that once existed in the industrial and commercial circles, as materials for self-education of industrialists and businessmen, with the aim of promoting further improvement of business operations and development of production. For many years, in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, prices often fluctuated, and speculation became a common phenomenon. Therefore, industrialists and businessmen were infected with many fraudulent, speculative, and counterfeit bad habits in their thinking and business operations. After liberation, under the leadership of the people's government, they have begun to gradually correct these habits. This year, Tianjin has further organized industrial and commercial households to conduct self-examination and mutual criticism through a series of professional meetings, and on the basis of preliminary awareness, has stipulated the specifications and quality of various goods, so that industry and commerce have achieved further transformation. Industrialists and businessmen wrote the regulations for correcting errors into patriotic covenants, and at this exhibition, they publicly exhibited the methods of deceiving the people in the past, allowing everyone to supervise the improvement.

The exhibition displays rubber shoes that fall apart after only a few days of wear, printed cloth that fades as soon as it is washed, shirts and vests that shrink a lot after washing, as well as goods such as using second-grade oil to impersonate kerosene, adding water and soil when making hemp ropes, adulterating flour, using boiled potatoes as medicinal materials, and using daylily as Tibetan saffron. To show their determination to improve, industrialists and businessmen also exhibited various improved goods that meet the specifications at the conference, and exhibited them in comparison with the deceptive goods of the past, helping the audience to distinguish between good and bad, genuine and fake. This kind of self-exposure exhibition was absolutely impossible in the old society. This shows that a new industrial and commercial morality and a new ideology are being established, which brings a bright and promising future to the new China's industry and commerce. In the past, many industrial and commercial households specialized in high-end luxury goods for the enjoyment of a few rulers, but today they are gradually transforming. In the past, 80% of the products of Tianjin's porcelain industry were decorations, but now 95% are goods needed by the working people, which has turned business from depression to prosperity.

Many small and medium-sized enterprises are promoting joint operations under the guidance and support of the people's government in order to overcome the predicament and backwardness caused by decentralized operations in the past. After the Tianjin freight forwarding industry implemented joint operations, its turnover increased by 1.5 times. Independent handicraftsmen in the shoe industry in Linqing County, Hebei Province, formed a production cooperative, and their business has also developed rapidly. There are many such examples.

All of this shows that under the leadership and assistance of the people's government, the new China's industry and commerce will overcome all difficulties and shortcomings, develop and progress rapidly, and bring economic prosperity to the new China.

    华北工商业在迅速发展
    ——华北区城乡物资交流展览会工商改进馆介绍
    本报特约记者    贾火
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会工商改进馆展出的材料指明：解放以来，人民政府实行公私兼顾、劳资两利政策，及从各方面扶助的结果，华北区的工商业已经有了很大的发展，并在继续发展。从一九五一年六月底工业户数的统计看，北京比一九五○年底增加了百分之七十四，天津比一九四八年底增加了百分之一百六十一，保定比一九四八年底增加了百分之九十四，太原比一九四九年五月增加了百分之四百三十九。商业户数，北京比一九四八年底增加了百分之二十七，石家庄比一九四八年底增加了百分之四十，天津比一九四九年底增加了百分之二十，太原比一九四九年四月增加了三·六九倍。有许多商品，今年开始出现了从来未有的淡季不淡、旺季更旺现象。
    随着工商业户数的增加，在业工人数字也增大了。以今年六月底和一九四九年初期比较，天津增加了一·一七倍，北京增加了一·一倍，保定增加了三·六五倍，太原增加了○·九七倍，张家口增加了一·六七倍，新乡增加了二九·三一倍。
    在国营、公营工厂方面，由于实行民主管理，开展生产竞赛，工人的生产积极性大大发挥起来，生产的数量质量均有显著的提高。以中央重工业部天津钢厂为例，一九五一年钢锭产量将比一九四八年增加八·一七倍，盘条产量将增加一一·七二倍。工人生产的价值，今年第二季度比第一季度增加了一·六三倍。从产品的质量看，钢锭一级品内的合格品已达百分之八十六·二，超过了百分之八十的标准；盘条一级品内的合格品达百分之八十九·四，超过了百分之七十五的标准。去年第一季度生产事故有五十二件，今年第二季度已减至十七件。从用电量看，今年也比一九四九年减少了一半。
    私营企业方面，由于普遍建立了劳资协商会议，通过劳资协商会议建立了检查制和责任制，开展了合理化建议运动，开展了各种竞赛；调整了工资，实行了劳动保护条例，生产也得到迅速的发展。以天津恒源纱厂为例，实行上述改革的结果，解放后两年七个月中，纱的产量增加了百分之三十五，纱的浪费减少了百分之五十三。工厂利润有十二亿多元又用于生产建设。
    在民主改革的基础上，各厂更逐渐订立了生产合同、联系合同和集体合同，建立了交班制，安全责任制，统计检查制，以及生产负责制等各种制度。这些科学的制度，进一步保证了生产的顺利进行。
    特别令人兴奋的，是解放了的工人阶级所表现的伟大创造能力。两年多来，工人阶级的发明创造是很难写完的。仅就工商改进馆展出的展品说，就有五一四一四缸引擎，无轨电车，高速柴油机，电石气发动机，五百门电话自动交换机，同时出两张纸的造纸机以及照像材料，化学染料，化学仪器，医用电灯泡，黑铅坩锅，胡麻制麻袋等七十余种。第
    一辆国产汽车，也已经创制出来了。
    今天这些东西不但能够自制，而且有许多还比外货成本低，质量高。天津工业局机器厂制造的无动力八叶离心分离机，能使胡麻子所含杂质减少到千分之一，超过了国际的标准。北京科学仪器工业社制造的化学仪器，如烧杯，不仅可以保证加热到摄氏二五○度后投入冷水中不碎不裂，而且同样的五百立方厘米的烧杯，外货成本要五万元，国产的只要六千元。我们自制的靛蓝精，比美国货“一四○”色的质量要高出百分之五。美国货售价，每箱约合八千斤小米，我们自制的只要七千斤。北京电车厂工人黄伯金创造的电车马达整流子里的“火玻璃圈”，成本只要十三万六千元，而外货却要五十万元。………这许许多多的事实，使帝国主义诬蔑中国人民没有创造能力的无耻谎言彻底粉碎了，使帝国主义对我们实行“封锁”的阴谋完全失败了。在中国共产党领导下的中国人民，没有克服不了的困难。
    两年来，在生产的不断发展中，工人阶级里面涌现出无数英雄模范的人物，成为劳动人民前进的旗帜。如天津钢厂特等劳动模范潘长有采取苏联的先进经验，热修马丁炉，提高了生产，节省了人民的资财。每热修一次，即可节省六十四个工作日，节省一千多万斤小米；他并且提出白灰炉用镁砂管子代替的办法，每次可节省三千块镁砖，折合十五万斤小米。天津恒大烟草厂中包部女工组长张淑云，分析和综合了女工冯文贞的“掩角法”，于桂兰的“盖盖法”，焦桂枝的“装盒法”，再加上她自己的“抓烟法”，使中包部全部操作过程的技术都提高一步，形成一整套完善的操作方法——“张淑云工作法”，正和苏联先进的“郭瓦廖夫工作法”相符合。现在正在天津市内迅速普遍地推行。此外，还有创造全国第一部高速柴油机的特等劳动模范——天津机器厂工程师洪宝顺和带动群众克服各种困难，按期完成军需任务，并提高了一般工友技术水平的天津被服厂第一缝纫部特等模范李兆珍等等。这一切创造发明与模范事迹，已成为推进经济建设的伟大力量。
    工商改进馆不仅展出已经获得的进步，也展出过去工商界曾经存在过的各种缺点与陋习，作为工商业家自我教育的材料，目的是推动工商业进一步的改善经营，发展生产。多少年来，在半殖民地半封建的社会中，物价时常波动，投机捣把成为普遍现象，因此工商业者在思想上经营上都习染了许多欺骗、投机、伪造等陋规恶习。解放后在人民政府领导下，已经开始逐步纠正。今年，天津市更通过一系列的专业会议，组织工商业户自我检查，互相批评，并在大家初步自觉的基础上，规定了各种货品的规格质量，使工商业获得了进一步的改造。工商业家把改正错误的条规订在爱国公约上，这次展览会上又把过去欺骗人民的方法公开展出，让大家监督改善。
    在展览会展出的，有穿不了几天就拆开胶底的胶鞋，有一下水就退色的印花布，洗一水就缩短很多的汗衫和背心，以及用二黄油冒充煤油，做麻绳时掺水掺土，面粉掺假捣鬼，用土豆煮了当药材，黄花菜当西藏红花等等的货品。工商业家为表示自己改进的决心，还在大会上展出各种合于规格的改进货品，与过去骗人的货品对比展出，帮助观众辨别好坏真伪。这种自我揭发性的展览是在旧社会里绝对不可能有的事情。这显示着一种新的工商业道德与新的思想观点正在树立，它给新中国工商业带来光明远大的前途。过去有许多工商业户专门经营为少数统治者所享用的高贵奢侈物品，今天也在逐步转变。天津磁器业过去的生产品，有百分之八十是陈设品，现在则有百分之九十五是劳动人民所需用的物品，因而使营业由萧条转向繁荣。
    许多中小企业为克服过去分散经营所造成的窘困、落后状态，他们在人民政府的指导扶植下正在推行联营的办法。天津货栈业实行联营后，营业额增加了一·五倍。河北省临清县鞋业独立手工业者组成了生产合作社，营业也迅速地获得了发展。这种例子很多。
    所有这些，都显示新中国的工商业将在人民政府的领导扶助下，克服一切困难与缺点，迅速发展、进步，给新中国带来经济的繁荣。
