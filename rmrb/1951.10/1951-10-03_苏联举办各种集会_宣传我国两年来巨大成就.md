Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 30th: On the eve of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union is holding various exhibitions, lectures, seminars, and concerts to publicize the great achievements of the Chinese people in building a new life over the past two years.
    In Moscow, the National Lenin Library held a literary exhibition on September 28th. The exhibition displayed numerous books and magazines introducing the achievements of liberated China. On the same day, Soviet scientist Martinov gave a public lecture, which was attended by a very large audience. Martinov said: The establishment of the People's Republic of China has clearly indicated to the Chinese working people that the path they have chosen is correct. The Chinese people are uniting more and more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and are fighting with one heart and one mind to defend world peace.
    Cities and towns in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, and other republics are also holding literary evenings and concerts to celebrate China's National Day. In the Latvian Republic, more than 300 cities and villages have held lectures introducing the heroic struggle of the Chinese people for liberation. The literary exhibition held in Riga, the capital of the republic, has been visited by tens of thousands of people.
    The works of Chinese writers are warmly welcomed by a wide readership in the Soviet Union. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, these works have been published in more than three million copies in ten languages of the Soviet nationalities. The works of the master of Chinese literature, Lu Xun, have been printed in 500,000 copies. In addition, in the past two years, a large number of works by young Chinese writers describing the new life of the Chinese people have been published.
    On the eve of the National Day of New China, Soviet radio stations also broadcast special programs to celebrate.

    俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、白俄罗斯及其他加盟共和国的城市和乡镇，也纷纷举办庆祝中国国庆的文艺晚会和音乐会。拉脱维亚共和国已有三百多个城市和乡村举办了演讲会，介绍中国人民争取解放的英雄斗争。共和国首都里加举办的文学展览会，已有成千上万的人前往参观。
