    In the past year, women nationwide have actively participated in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, demonstrating their strength and role.
    From the very beginning of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, female workers in various regions launched patriotic labor competitions, resulting in the emergence of numerous model individuals and model deeds. For example, Zhang Lan, a female worker at the Yumin Rubber Factory in Dalian, Northeast China, proposed the slogan "Strive for Saving One Second." She precisely calculated working hours and improved operating methods, resulting in an increase in production from 60 pairs of shoes per day to 360 pairs, increasing work efficiency by five times while maintaining quality standards. In the Central and Southern regions, female workers accounted for 24.4% of the advanced production groups in state-owned factories and 57% in private factories. In East China, young female worker Hao Jianxiu, who created new working methods, and model female workers Hang Peilan and Xu Fengying, emerged.
    Rural women contributed to the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement through practical actions such as enthusiastically paying agricultural taxes, planting more patriotic cotton, and planting more patriotic grain. For example, rural women in Xuchang, Henan, proposed increasing production by 10%, while rural women in Zhengzhou proposed producing an extra ten catties of wheat per mu to support the front lines. After understanding that Resist-America, Aid-Korea meant defending their homes and country, rural women in Minjia Village, Yidu, Shandong, said, "For Resist-America, Aid-Korea, we will provide people if needed, money if needed, and we are ready to answer Chairman Mao's call at any time."
    The noble expression of women's patriotic enthusiasm was sending their husbands and children to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army or sending their children to military cadre schools. In Changling County, Jilin, Northeast China, 1,200 people joined the Volunteer Army, of which 567 were mobilized by women. Among the first batch of 13,000 people from Guangzhou to join military cadre schools, 3,500 were women. In the process of women sending their sons and husbands to join the army or military cadre schools, many touching stories emerged.
    Many outstanding daughters of China joined volunteer medical teams and surgical teams to work in Korea, including nationally renowned model female medical workers Li Landing and Ding Zhihui. Many female medical workers wrote letters of determination and made plans to strive for meritorious service before going abroad. On the Korean battlefield, they demonstrated a high degree of class love and selfless spirit to rescue Chinese and Korean people's soldiers, and 80% of them were commended for their contributions. Among them emerged heroes and models such as Jiang Shuhua and Wang Ying, who were meritorious in rescuing the wounded, and model female medical workers Liu Xiuzhen and Che Shuqin.
    Millions of patriotic women expressed their love for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army by sewing comfort bags, military uniforms, and military shoes. Three thousand female workers in Guangzhou and 2,300 female teachers, students, and staff who participated in voluntary labor completed 180,000 sets of military uniforms. In the Northeast, military uniform processing and cotton wadding work were mainly completed by street working women. Many women took out their treasured embroidered threads and fabrics to carefully sew comfort bags, filling them with supplies needed by the soldiers. According to incomplete statistics from three cities and five special districts in Shandong Province, women wrote a total of 22,839 comfort letters and made 59,179 comfort bags. During the donation campaign for weapons, women in Guangzhou immediately raised the donation amount for a fighter plane at the report meeting of the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army. Women in Wuhan also donated 69.295 million yuan in Renminbi, as well as gold and silver jewelry, on the spot at the report meeting of the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army.
    Women across the country plan to donate a total of 59 aircraft named after women's groups, as well as two artillery pieces. Currently, women in various regions are actively making payments, striving to complete the donation plan. In order to welcome the anniversary of the Volunteer Army's departure, women in Shanghai have already paid 9 billion yuan, completing the donation plan for six Shanghai Family Women's aircraft.
    In order to ensure the completion of the donation plan, many female workers and farmers have formulated plans to increase production and make donations. For example, the Chi Guizhen production group in Harbin stipulated in the patriotic pact that they would guarantee exceeding the production plan by 10% each month and donate one-tenth of the bonus for overproduction to aircraft and artillery. In many areas, housewives used meticulous calculation methods to save money for donations. Many women incorporated increased production for donation, preferential treatment for families of martyrs and soldiers, and other work into patriotic pacts, and came up with many specific ways to help families of martyrs and soldiers, such as plowing fields, carrying firewood, and fetching water for them, and helping to introduce employment in cities, fully demonstrating the spirit of mutual assistance. In the work of respecting and giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers carried out among residents in Shanghai's neighborhoods, female activists played a leading role.
    The patriotic actions of women across the country in actively participating in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement have demonstrated the great strength and role of women. At the same time, through this great movement, women's political awareness has been increasing day by day, and the unity of women from all walks of life has been expanding and consolidating, thus advancing women's work by a big step.

    全国妇女一年来在抗美援朝运动中的贡献
    一年来，全国妇女积极参加抗美援朝运动，显示出了妇女的力量与作用。
    各地女工在抗美援朝运动一开始，就纷纷发动爱国主义劳动竞赛，涌现出了很多模范人物与模范事迹。如东北大连裕民胶皮工厂女工张兰提出了“为节省一秒钟而斗争”的口号，她精确地计算工时，并改进操作方法，结果从过去每天缝六十双鞋提高到三百六十双，工作效率提高了五倍，质量也合规格。中南区公营厂的先进生产小组中女工占百分之二十·四，私营厂的先进小组中女工占百分之五十七。在华东，出现了创造新工作方法的青年女工郝建秀和模范女工杭佩兰、徐凤英等人。
    农村妇女以踊跃交纳公粮、多种爱国棉、多种爱国粮等实际行动来抗美援朝。如河南许昌的农村妇女提出增产一成，郑州的农村妇女提出每亩多打十斤麦子来支援前线。山东益都闵家庄的农村妇女在懂得抗美援朝就是保家卫国的道理后说：“为了抗美援朝，要人有人，要钱有钱，随时听毛主席的召唤。”
    妇女爱国热情的崇高表现是送自己的丈夫、子女参加中国人民志愿军，或送子女参加军事干部学校。东北吉林长岭县参加志愿军的有一千二百人，其中由妇女动员参加的就有五百六十七名。广州第一批参加军事干部学校的一万三千人中，有三千五百个是妇女。各地妇女在送子送郎参军参加军事干部学校中间，出现了很多动人的事例。
    许多优秀的中华女儿参加了志愿医疗队、手术队到朝鲜去工作，其中有全国著名的模范女医务工作者李蓝丁和丁志辉。很多女医务工作者在出国时，都写下了决心书，订下了争取立功的计划。她们在朝鲜战场上发挥了高度的阶级友爱与忘我的精神来救护中朝人民战士，百分之八十的人都立了功。她们之中并出现了抢救伤员功臣姜淑华、王颖等和模范女医务工作者刘秀珍、车书琴等英雄模范。
    千千万万的爱国妇女用缝制慰问袋，缝制军衣、军鞋来表示她们对中国人民志愿军的热爱。广州市劳动妇女三千人和参加义务劳动的女教师、女学生、女职工二千三百人，完成了十八万套军服。在东北，军衣加工工作和絮行工作主要是由街道劳动妇女来完成的。很多妇女把舍不得用的绣花线和布拿出来精心缝制慰问袋，在慰问袋内装满了战士需要的用品。据山东省三个城市五个专区不完全的统计：妇女共写慰问信二万二千八百三十九封，做慰问袋五万九千一百七十九个。在捐献武器运动中，广州市妇女在志愿军归国代表的报告会上，当场就集齐了一架战斗机的捐献数字。武汉市妇女也在志愿军归国代表的报告会上，当场捐献了人民币六千九百二十九万五千元，并有金银首饰等物。
    全国各地妇女计划捐献的以妇女号命名的飞机共有五十九架，另有大炮二门。目前各地妇女都在踊跃缴款，努力完成捐献计划。为了迎接志愿军出国周年纪念，上海市妇女已缴款九十亿元，完成了六架上海家庭妇女号飞机的捐献计划。
    为了保证捐献计划的完成，许多女工、农妇都订立了增产捐献计划。如哈尔滨迟桂珍生产小组在爱国公约中规定了每月保证超过生产计划百分之十，把超额奖金的十分之一来捐献飞机大炮。许多地区的家庭妇女用精打细算的方法来节约捐献。许多妇女把增产捐献、优待烈士家属和军人家属工作等都订入爱国公约内，并想出许多具体的办法来帮助烈士家属和军人家属，如为他们代耕、担柴、挑水，在城市中帮助介绍职业等，充分发挥了互助互济的精神。上海里弄居民中间开展的尊敬优待烈士家属和军人家属的工作，家庭妇女积极分子起了带头作用。
    全国妇女积极参加抗美援朝的爱国行动，显示了妇女的伟大力量与作用。同时经过了这一伟大运动，妇女的政治觉悟已日益提高，各阶层妇女的团结也日益扩大巩固，因而妇女工作也向前推进了一大步。（新华社）
