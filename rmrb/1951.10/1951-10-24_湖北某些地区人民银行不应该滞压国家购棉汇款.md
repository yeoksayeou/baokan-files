    People's Banks in Certain Areas of Hubei Should Not Withhold State Cotton Purchase Remittances
    The People's Banks in various parts of Hubei Province have repeatedly withheld remittances from the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation, which has severely affected the state's timely purchase of cotton. For example, the Shishou People's Bank withheld six hundred million yuan in cotton purchase funds remitted by the Mianyang branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation to its Ouchi branch for as long as six months and twenty-five days. The Jianli People's Bank also withheld four hundred million yuan in cotton purchase funds remitted by the Mianyang branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation to its Jianli branch for three months. Similar withholding situations have occurred in Macheng, Songbu, Fancheng, and other places, with withholding periods ranging from twenty-odd days to ten-odd days. Some People's Banks in certain areas have also exhibited serious irresponsibility after withholding cotton purchase remittances from the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation. For example, on August 1st, the Huanggang branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation remitted 150 million yuan from the Tuanfeng People's Bank to its Huangmei business office for advance purchase of cotton. As of August 27th, the funds had not yet been received. When the Huanggang branch inquired with the Tuanfeng People's Bank, the reply was: "The funds were remitted on the same day. The contract stipulates that the bank is responsible for remitting the funds on the same day. The bank is not responsible for delays caused by telecommunications in transit." This is a seriously irresponsible work attitude towards the people. Withholding remittances from the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation not only affects the turnover of state trade funds but also affects the smooth progress of cotton purchasing and the credibility of state banks. We believe that the Hubei Provincial People's Bank should pay attention to these serious situations, earnestly investigate the causes and responsibilities for the withholding, and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    湖北某些地区人民银行不应该滞压国家购棉汇款
    湖北省各地一再发生人民银行滞压花纱布公司汇款的事情，严重地影响了国家及时收购棉花的工作。如石首人民银行滞压沔阳花纱布分公司拨汇藕池花纱布支公司的购棉资金六亿元竟达六个月零二十五天之久；监利人民银行也滞压沔阳花纱布分公司拨汇监利花纱布支公司购棉资金四亿元达三个月；其他如麻城、宋埠、樊城等地也有类似滞压情况，滞压日期二十多天、十多天不等。某些地区人民银行滞压花纱布购棉汇款后还表现严重的不负责任现象。如黄冈花纱布支公司八月一日由团风人民银行拨汇黄梅营业所预购棉花资金一亿五千元，直到八月二十七日还未拨到，黄冈支公司向团风人民银行查询，得到答复是：“款当天就汇出了。合约上订明银行负责当天汇出，中途电讯耽误，银行不负责。”这是严重的对人民不负责任的工作态度。滞压花纱布公司汇款，既影响了国家贸易资金的周转，也影响了收棉工作的顺利进行和国家银行的信誉。我们认为，湖北省人民银行应重视这些严重情况，切实追究滞压原因和责任，防止再有类似的事情发生。  靳吾
