    Henan Province: Various Regions Emphasize Strengthening Political Education Work for Peasants

    Since June, Henan Province has successively launched political and ideological education campaigns for rural cadres and the masses of peasants. These campaigns have initially corrected the negligence, apathy, and lack of political awareness among some rural cadres, and have raised the political consciousness of the peasant masses, thereby promoting the progress of various tasks.

    After the land reform work was basically completed throughout the province, a sense of complacency and apathy arose among some rural cadres, who believed that the revolution had finally succeeded. Zhang Shusheng, a member of the Farmers' Association in Houying Township, Mianchi County, was unwilling to continue working, saying, "Farmers' Association members should be replaced every three months. Now I've been doing it for eight months, do you want me to do it for the rest of my life?!" Liu Haijiang, a township cadre in Yanling County, said, "Having land, a house, an ox, and a 'hairdressing head' (referring to his wife) is enough for me. There's no benefit to being a cadre anymore." Some, while continuing to work, were very passive. Apathy and laxity were also serious among the peasants, manifested in their unwillingness to attend meetings. Some militia members even "stored their knives and guns." This trend became more pronounced after the start of the Korean armistice negotiations. Coercive commandism on the part of cadres also emerged. In some villages, because the masses did not attend meetings, it was decided: "Those who do not attend the meeting will be fined one work day, and group leaders who do not attend will be fined two work days." As a result, unlawful landlords and counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to engage in activities, spread rumors, sabotage, and even launched counter-attacks to usurp rural leadership. For example, in Houqiao Township, Seventh District, Shan County, landlords usurped the leadership of the Farmers' Association and "cleansed" forty loyal peasants. Consequently, various rural tasks could not be carried out smoothly.

    After discovering the above situation, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately instructed local Party committees to strengthen political work among rural cadres and the masses of peasants, and sternly crack down on the destructive activities of the enemy. The Henan Daily published an article on August 19th, calling on all regions to strengthen the political and ideological education of rural cadres and peasants, and to severely crack down on the destructive activities of the enemy. Subsequently, various regions convened meetings of cadres at the county, district, and township levels, meetings of peasant representatives, meetings of propagandists, and meetings of militia representatives. Some counties also convened meetings of people's representatives from all walks of life. Patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea and education on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were carried out. Following these meetings, various regions further enhanced the patriotic thinking of the people by mobilizing the masses of peasants to investigate their experiences of liberation, examine patriotic pacts, and discuss current affairs issues. The propaganda and education campaign mobilized a very large propaganda force. According to statistics from Suiping and Shangcai counties, the number of people engaged in propaganda and education work in one month reached more than 200,000. They used various propaganda forms and tools, such as comic strips, "local films," blackboards, and loudspeakers, to conduct extensive propaganda work, with great effect. Many cadres who were originally passive and unwilling to work are now active again, expressing their determination to carry the revolution through to the end. The broad masses of peasants have risen up to fight against unlawful landlords and counter-revolutionaries. According to statistics from the four special districts of Huangchuan, Shanzhou, and Luoyang, 835 unlawful landlords and bullies have bowed their heads to the masses. Many peasants expressed that "as long as the enemy exists, we cannot relax our struggle for a single day," and that "peace is won through struggle; without intensifying the resistance against America and aiding Korea, there will be no peace." Based on this awareness, the local Party committees launched a campaign to inspect and revise patriotic pacts, and launched a patriotic campaign to increase production and make donations. Peasants have already paid 10 billion yuan. At the same time, progress has been made in the work of providing preferential treatment to military families in various regions. Peasants in Helou Township, Third District, Shangcai County, put forward the slogans that the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers should be given "four priorities" (priority in plowing, harrowing, planting, and harvesting) and "three guarantees" (guaranteeing that the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers do not live in leaky houses, do not lack drinking water, and that their land produces no less grain). In addition, through this propaganda and education, peasants in many regions have gained a preliminary understanding of New Democratic agricultural production and have voluntarily organized themselves to develop production. In Dengfeng County, 568 mutual aid teams were consolidated and reorganized in August, and this number increased to 1,500 in September.

    However, some deviations occurred in carrying out this work in individual regions. For example, there was a lack of adequate preparation before launching the campaign, and after the work began, because the peasants could not accept it for a while, they crudely proposed that "whoever has agricultural socialist ideas is a bad egg," forcing the masses to accept education. These should be corrected.

### 河南省各地注意加强对农民的政治教育工作

    河南省各地注意加强对农民的政治教育工作
    河南省自六月份以来，先后展开了对农村干部、农民群众的政治思想教育工作，初步纠正了部分农村干部的轻敌麻痹不问政治思想，提高了农民群众的政治觉悟。推动了各项工作的开展。
    在全省土地改革工作基本上完成之后，在部分农村干部中产生了轻敌麻痹思想，以为革命已经最后成功。渑池县后营乡农民协会委员张书生，不愿再继续干工作，他说：“农民协会委员按理该三个月一换，现在我干了八个月了，还能叫我干一辈子？！”鄢陵县乡干部刘海江说：“有了地，有了房，有了牛，有了剪发头（指妻子）就够我的了，再当干部就没好处了。”有的虽然还在继续工作，但很消极。至于农民中的麻痹松懈思想也很严重，表现在不愿参加会议，有些民兵都把“刀枪入库”，特别是在朝鲜停战谈判开始以后，这种思想的发展更为严重。干部的强迫命令作风也随之发生。有些村因群众不来开会，便决定：“群众不到会，罚工一个，小组长不到会，罚工两个。”这一来，不法地主和反革命分子便乘机活动，造谣破坏，甚至反攻倒算、篡夺乡村领导权。如陕县七区侯桥乡地主就篡夺农民协会领导权，“清洗”了四十个忠实农民。农村各项工作因此不能顺利开展。
    中共河南省委发现上述情况后，即指示各地党委立即加强对农村干部与农民群众的政治工作。河南日报于八月十九日发表论文，号召各地加强对乡村干部、农民群众的政治思想教育，严厉打击敌人的破坏活动。此后，各地即先后召开了县区乡各级干部会，农民代表会，宣传员会议，民兵代表会议，有些县还召开了各界人民代表会议。进行了抗美援朝爱国主义教育和镇压反革命的教育。继这些会议之后，各地通过发动农民群众查翻身、查爱国公约、讨论时事问题，进一步提高了人民群众的爱国主义的思想。这个宣传教育运动所动员的宣传力量是非常大的，据遂平、上蔡两县统计，一个月来，从事宣传教育工作的人数即达二十万余人。他们运用连环画、“土电影”、黑板报、广播筒等宣传形式与宣传工具，进行了广泛的宣传工作，效果很大。许多原来消极不工作的干部，现在又积极起来，纷纷表示要革命到底。广大农民起来和不法地主、反革命分子进行斗争，据潢川、陕州、洛阳四个专区统计，有八百三十五个不法地主和恶霸向群众低头了。很多农民表示“敌人存在一天，咱们一天也不能放松斗争”，“和平是争取来的，不加紧抗美援朝，就没有和平”。在此觉悟基础上，当地党委即发动检查和修订爱国公约，并展开了爱国增产捐献的运动，农民已缴款一百亿元。同时，各地优抚工作也有进展。上蔡县三区贺楼乡农民提出了烈军属的地要“四先”（先犁、先耙、先种、先收）“三保证”（不使烈军属住漏房子，不使烈军属缺吃水，不使烈军属的地少打粮食）的口号。此外，经过这次宣传教育，很多地区的农民对新民主主义的农业生产有了初步认识，自动组织起来发展生产。登封县八月份就整理与巩固了五百六十八个互助组，九月份就发展到一千五百个。
    但是，个别地区在进行这一工作时，发生了一些偏差，如开展这一运动之前，缺乏充分准备工作，工作开始后，因农民一时不能接受，即粗暴地提出“谁有农业社会主义思想谁就是坏蛋”，强迫群众接受教育。这些是应该纠正的。
