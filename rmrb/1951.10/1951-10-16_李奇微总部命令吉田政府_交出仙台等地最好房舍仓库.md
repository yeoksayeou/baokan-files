Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 15th -- According to a report from the Electric Communication Agency in Manila on the 11th: The American authorities are making extensive preparations for the long-term occupation of Japan based on the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." This shows that as long as the treaty is in effect, any future Japanese government will inevitably be a surrendered government. The talks of some senior American officials touring the Pacific region clearly reveal this point.

These talks indicate that Ridgway Headquarters has drafted a plan for the stationing of American troops in Japan. According to this plan, American occupation forces will be stationed in Sapporo (in Hokkaido), Sendai, and Yokosuka, and will send troops to Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, and Fukuoka.

According to the secret clauses of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," American military personnel will have full power to freely control Japanese civil authorities and people living within the American military garrison areas. Japanese authorities and people will legally be subordinate to the American authorities, and they must hand over their houses, warehouses, theaters, cinemas, ports, railways, and highways to the American military for use.

In order to prepare for the stationing of American troops in various places, Ridgway Headquarters has ordered the Japanese government to hand over the best houses and warehouses in Sendai, Sapporo, Yokosuka, Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, Fukuoka, and nearby towns and villages to the American military. The Japanese Special Procurement Board (supply agency) has been ordered by Ridgway Headquarters to produce military equipment for the American military.

According to a clause in the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the headquarters of the U.S. forces stationed in Japan will continue to control Japan's economic, political, and military activities even after the separate treaty is ratified. However, in order not to draw attention to Ridgway's direct involvement in all decisions of the Japanese government, Ridgway Headquarters believes that it is best to locate the headquarters in Yokohama rather than Tokyo. Ridgway Headquarters is already preparing to move several important departments (such as the Economic and Scientific Bureau and the Intelligence Bureau) from Tokyo to Yokohama. Starting in November, the American military police will strictly inspect every traveler going to Yokohama.

    李奇微总部命令吉田政府
    交出仙台等地最好房舍仓库
    【新华社十五日讯】据电通社马尼拉十一日讯：美国当局根据美日“安全条约”正在进行长期占领日本的广泛的准备工作。这表明：只要条约一日生效，将来任何日本政府就必得是一个投降的政府。周游视察太平洋地区的美国高级官员的一些谈话，清楚地透露了这一点。
    这些谈话说明：李奇微总部已拟出一个美军驻扎日本的计划。依据这个计划，美国占领军将驻扎在札幌（在北海道）、仙台和横须贺，并将派部队驻在东京、横滨、名古屋、大阪、神户和福冈等地。
    根据美日“安全条约”的秘密条款，美国军事人员将有充分权力自由支配住在美军驻扎区以内的日本民政当局和人民。日本当局和人民在法律上将听命于美国当局，他们必须把他们的房屋、仓库、戏院、电影院、港口、铁路和公路等交给美国军人使用。
    李奇微总部为了进行美军在各地驻扎的准备工作，已命令日本政府把仙台、札幌、横须贺、大阪、神户、名古屋、福冈和以上各地附近乡镇的最好的房屋和仓库移交给美国军队。日本特别调达厅
    （供应机关）已奉李奇微总部的命令，为美军生产军事装备。
    根据美日“安全条约”的一项条款，驻日美军总部即使在单独和约批准以后，仍将控制日本的经济、政治和军事方面的活动。但是，为了不使人们注意到李奇微直接参与日本政府的一切决定起见，李奇微总部认为最好是把总部设在横滨而不设在东京。李奇微总部已经准备把几个重要的部门（如经济科学局和谍报局），从东京迁到横滨。从十一月起，美国宪兵将严格盘查每个到横滨去的旅客。
