    Conscientiously Launch the Ideological Remolding Study Movement Among University Teachers

    Recently, teachers from various universities in Beijing and Tianjin, under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, have been conducting a systematic ideological remolding study movement. This is a very important matter in the current educational reform work.

    Over the past year, universities across the country have generally carried out some preliminary curriculum reforms and departmental adjustments. To make universities adapt to the needs of the country in training cadres, this reform is absolutely necessary and cannot be delayed. Experience over the past year has proven that to do this reform work well, it is first necessary to improve the political level of university faculty and staff. If university faculty and staff have not earnestly established the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, have not armed themselves with Marxism-Leninism, and have not abandoned individualistic, liberal, vulgar viewpoints and the cultural ideology of the reactionary bourgeoisie of Europe and America, then the reform of higher education will inevitably encounter various obstacles and resistance. Therefore, the ideological remolding of teachers is one of the important preconditions for reforming the old education.

    This kind of study, like other studies, must closely link revolutionary theory with the learners' own ideology, carry out criticism and self-criticism, avoid dogmatic empty talk and aimless rambling. Conscientiously carrying out this kind of criticism and self-criticism is clearly a difficult problem for the current university teachers, but it is also a problem that must be thoroughly solved and absolutely cannot be avoided. University teachers in the new era must conduct serious and bold criticism of various erroneous or incorrect ideas, and must, on the one hand, focus on examining themselves, opposing the attitude of being complacent, arrogant, and disdainful of others; on the other hand, they must dare to criticize each other, abandoning the hypocritical politeness of protecting oneself by being worldly wise. It is very clear that if today's university teachers themselves cannot practice the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and set an example, then how can they hope to train the younger generation with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism?

    This kind of study must also be closely linked with the school's and individual's professional work. In the process of learning, it is necessary to be realistic and have clear goals, so that after a certain period of study, clear changes can be realized in the school's education plan and the individual's teaching content and teaching methods, and gradually realize the thorough reform of the entire higher education.

    Although the study movement in universities in Beijing and Tianjin is still in its initial stage, most of the faculty and staff have shown importance and enthusiasm for this study; especially Premier Zhou's report, which gave everyone great encouragement. In the process of learning, there may naturally be a few people who lack a correct understanding of the meaning of learning, and thus adopt a cold and perfunctory attitude. The leaders of the study should help them understand the importance of ideological remolding and overcome incorrect viewpoints. We believe that under the serious and responsible leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, this study will achieve the desired results.

    The ideological remolding study movement of teachers in universities in Beijing and Tianjin has a demonstrative effect for universities across the country. It is hoped that the Ministry of Education can promptly promote the experience of this study movement to universities across the country.

### 认真展开高等学校教师中的思想改造学习运动

    认真展开高等学校教师中的思想改造学习运动
    最近北京、天津各高等学校的教师，在中央人民政府教育部统一领导下，进行了有系统的思想改造的学习运动。这是当前改革教育工作上一件值得十分重视的事情。
    一年来，全国各高等学校一般都初步进行了一些课程改革和院系调整工作。为了使高等学校适应于国家培养干部的需要，这种改革是完全必要的和不能拖延的。一年来的经验证明了，要做好这改革工作，必须首先提高高等学校教职员的政治水平。如果高等学校教职员没有认真树立起全心全力为人民服务的思想，没有用马克思列宁主义思想来武装自己，没有抛弃掉个人主义、自由主义的庸俗观点和欧美反动资产阶级的文化思想，那么，高等教育的改革工作，就必然遇到种种障碍和阻力。因此教师的思想改造工作，乃是改革旧教育的重要前提之一。
    这样的学习，和其他学习一样，必须把革命理论和学习者自己的思想意识密切联系起来，开展批评和自我批评，避免教条式的空论和无目的的漫谈，认真开展这种批评和自我批评，在现在的大学教师中显然是一个难题，但又是一个必须彻底解决而绝对不可回避的问题。新时代的大学教师，必须对于各种错误的或不正确的思想，进行严肃的、大胆的批判，必须一方面着重检讨自己，反对自满自负目无余子的态度；另一方面勇于互相批评，抛弃明哲保身的虚伪的客气。很明白，如果今天的大学教师们自己不能对于批评和自我批评的精神身体力行，以身作则，那么，怎样能希望他们用批评和自我批评的精神来训练青年的一代呢？
    这样的学习，也必须和学校与个人的业务工作密切地联系起来。在学习过程中，必须实事求是，具有明确的目标，使经过一定时期的学习后，在学校的教育计划和个人的教学内容、教学方法上都能够实现明确的改变，逐步实现整个高等教育的彻底的改革。
    北京、天津各高等学校的学习运动，虽然还在开始阶段，但大多数的教职员对于这次学习已经表现了重视和热心；尤其是周总理的报告，给了大家以极大的鼓励。在学习过程中，自然也可能有少数人对学习的意义还缺乏正确的认识，因而采取冷淡敷衍的态度。学习的领导者应该帮助他们了解思想改造的重要性，克服不正确的观点。我们相信，在中央人民政府教育部的严肃负责的领导下，这次学习是会得到预期的效果的。
    北京、天津各高等学校教师的思想改造的学习运动，对于全国高等学校，具有示范的作用。希望中央教育部能够把这次学习运动的经验，及时地推广到全国各高等学校中去。
