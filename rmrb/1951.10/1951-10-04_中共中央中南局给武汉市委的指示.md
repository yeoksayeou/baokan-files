    Instructions from the CCP Central Committee Central-South Bureau to the Wuhan Municipal Committee and the Party Leadership Group of the Municipal Government:

    The matter of Comrade Song Ying, Zhou Jifang, and others violating Party discipline by suppressing mass criticism has been delayed for a year without resolution. The People's Daily published the details of this matter on September 11th, along with a commentary. You should immediately express your attitude toward this matter, stating: 1. Your understanding and attitude toward this matter; 2. Set a deadline for reaching a conclusion regarding the individuals and organizations that violated discipline; 3. Set a deadline for relevant personnel to conduct self-criticism regarding this matter. To achieve a more unified ideological understanding of this issue, you need to convene a meeting of the Municipal Committee to discuss the People's Daily's "Party Life" column's brief commentary on this issue, the CCP Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, the Central-South Bureau's resolution from April 1950 regarding this issue, and other relevant documents. Based on the spirit of these documents, the Municipal Committee should formulate a written conclusion and report it to us. This matter should be discussed among cadres within the Municipal Committee, especially leading cadres, connecting it with personal thoughts and similar issues encountered in their work to conduct self-criticism and strive for thorough ideological understanding, which will facilitate the development of criticism and self-criticism and uphold Party discipline. Your attitude toward handling this matter must be submitted within a week so that it can be published together when the Yangtze River Daily reprints it. With
    Comradely Greetings, Central-South Bureau, September 14, 1951.
     Eliminating the Style of Suppressing Mass Criticism

    To the Editor:
    I believe the report on the Song Ying incident published in the People's Daily on September 11th is correct. As a staff member of the Wuhan Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, I directly participated in the investigation of this incident and am familiar with the entire process. Many comrades who read this report felt that the People's Daily's criticism was very accurate. They said, "Only in this way can the problem be thoroughly resolved."
    The "Party Life" commentary's analysis of Song Ying and others' mistakes in suppressing criticism is correct. In the past, the leading organs of the Party in Wuhan had not deeply recognized the seriousness of this issue, leading to a poor handling of the matter. The undemocratic style of some Party cadres in Wuhan is very serious. Incidents of accusations against such cadres occur constantly. Some accusations are unsigned, and some signed ones request confidentiality. This is not without reason. For example, some responsible cadres, seeing that a comrade makes too many suggestions, want to send him away. Some want to label cadres who offer suggestions as "anti-leadership, engaging in small group activities," and call complaints letters that bypass Party committee review "black letters," always wanting to take retaliatory action against those who offer suggestions. Some even describe complainants as people with "unclear political backgrounds" or even "objects of democratic dictatorship." Song Ying is a representative of this type of thinking. The more this happens, the less daring complainants are to sign their names. As the "Party Life" commentary points out, "This kind of anonymous accusation is precisely a manifestation of extremely abnormal Party life, an extreme lack of democratic style, and an extremely undeveloped state of criticism and self-criticism." However, righteousness must be promoted, and evil must be overcome. The Party organizations in Wuhan should earnestly organize all Party cadres to engage in discussions about Song Ying's mistakes, conduct criticism and self-criticism, to thoroughly eliminate this bad undemocratic style.

    中共中央中南局给武汉市委的指示武汉市委并市府党组：
    宋瑛、周季方等同志违犯党的纪律压制群众批评一事，拖延一年尚未处理，人民日报已于九月十一日将此事经过公布并作了评论。你们应该即刻对此事表明态度，说明：一、你们对此事的认识和态度；二、限期对违犯纪律的人和组织作出结论；三、对此事有关人员限期作出检讨。为着求得对这一问题在思想上更能达到一致，你们需要召开市委会讨论人民日报“党的生活”栏对这一问题的简评，中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定，中南局一九五○年四月处理有关这一问题的决议等文件，根据这些文件的精神由市委作出书面结论报告我们。此事要在市委所属的干部中首先是领导干部中开展对这一问题的讨论，联系个人思想和在工作中遇到的类似的问题进行检讨，并求得从思想上彻底弄通，以利批评和自我批评的开展，严肃党的纪律。你们对此事的处理态度务于一周内送来，以便长江日报转载时一起公布。致以
    布礼中南局一九五一年九月十四日
     肃清压制群众批评的作风编辑同志：
    我认为九月十一日人民日报所发表的有关宋瑛事件的报道是对的。因为我是武汉市委纪律检查委员会的工作人员，直接参加了这一事件的检查，熟悉这一事件的全部过程。很多同志读了这个报道后，都觉得人民日报的批评很对，他们说：“只有这样，问题才能得到彻底解决。”
    “党的生活简评”对宋瑛等压制批评错误的分析是正确的。过去武汉市党的领导机关，还没有深刻地认识这一问题的严重性，以致对此事处理得不好。武汉市部分党员干部不民主的作风是很严重的，控告这种干部的事件不断发生，有的控告书上不署名，有的署了名也要求代守秘密。这不是没有原因的，如有的负责干部看那个同志提意见多，就要把他送走。有的要给提意见的干部戴“反领导，小组织活动”的帽子，并把不经党委审查的越级控告信叫作“黑信”，老想对提意见的人采取报复态度。有的则把控告者说成“政治面目不清”的人，甚至说这是“民主专政的对象”。宋瑛正是这类思想的代表者。愈是这样，控告者就愈不敢署名了。正如“党的生活简评”中所指出的，“这种匿名控告，正是党内生活极不正常，民主作风极端缺乏，批评和自我批评极不开展的表现”。但是，正气必须发扬，邪气必须克服。武汉市的党组织应认真组织全体党员干部展开对宋瑛所犯错误的讨论，进行批评与自我批评，以便彻底肃清这种不民主的恶劣作风。  王世勋
