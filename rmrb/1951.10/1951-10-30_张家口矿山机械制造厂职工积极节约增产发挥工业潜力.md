Workers of the Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory are actively carrying out a campaign to increase production and conserve resources, creating new records. The factory's production task for the third quarter was very heavy. However, thanks to the ingenuity of all the workers, improved technology, and the creation of new records, the production task was completed two days ahead of schedule, and a large amount of raw materials and man-hours were saved. According to incomplete statistics, the value of the savings was equivalent to over 279,500 catties of millet. Based on these results, the factory's CCP Committee, having completed the third quarter's task, proposed a requirement for the fourth quarter's production to reduce costs by 5 to 10 percent. This requirement was enthusiastically responded to by all workers, and collective and individual plans for increasing production and conserving resources were formulated, further expanding the competition. According to statistics from the first half of October, various workshops have achieved new successes. For example, the Chen Chunye and Liu Xiangxuan team in the Riveting Department increased their production of coal chute sections from an average of 35 sections per day in July and August to 80 sections in September, and 90 sections in the first half of October. The Wang Shijun team in the same department increased their grinding of small angle iron from 300 pieces in July and August to 800 pieces in September, and 1,200 pieces in the first half of October, increasing efficiency threefold. Many teams in other departments, such as the Machining Department, Fitter Department, Forging Department, Finishing Department, Nail Making Department, Lumber Department, and Electrical Department, have all exceeded their plans. The factory's workers have created 15 technical improvements. (Jiao Dahai)

    张家口矿山机械制造厂职工积极节约增产发挥工业潜力
    张家口矿山机械制造厂职工积极开展增产节约创造新纪录运动。该厂第三季的生产任务，是很繁重的。但由于全体职工开动脑筋，改进技术，创造新纪录的结果，提前两天完成了生产任务，并节省了大批的原材料和工时。据不完全的统计，价值小米二十七万九千五百余斤。该厂中共党委根据这些情况，在完成了第三季任务的基础上，提出了第四季生产要减低成本百分之五至十的要求。这个要求获得了全体职工热烈的响应，并制订了集体与个人的增产节约计划，进一步地展开了竞赛。根据十月上半月的统计，各车间又获得了新的成就。如铆工部的陈纯业、刘相轩小组，压煤溜槽子由七、八月份平均每日压三十五节，提高到九月份的八十节，十月上半月达到九十节。该部王士俊小组磨小角铁，由七、八月份的三百块提高到九月份的八百块，十月上半月达到了一千二百块，提高了效率三倍。其他机工部、钳工部、锻工部、装修部、制钉部、制材部、电工部有许多小组都超额完成了计划。全厂职工已创造了十五件技术上的改进。（焦大海）
