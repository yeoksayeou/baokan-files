    Handcraft Production Should Be Developed with Planning

    Expanding Urban and Rural Materials Exchange, Developing Industrial and Agricultural Production
    Handicraft industry is the main sideline of the vast rural areas of North China, and also accounts for a large proportion of industrial production in large, medium, and small cities. After the land reform, the living standards of farmers gradually improved, and their demand for industrial products became increasingly urgent. However, judging from the current situation of industrial production in our country, machine-made industrial products are far from meeting the needs of the people. According to statistics, handcraft products account for about 80 percent of the industrial products used by farmers in North China; from this, it can be seen that, at present, it is still very necessary to develop handcraft production in a purposeful and planned manner.
    In the Handicraft Pavilion of the North China Region Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition, thousands of kinds of handcraft products produced in various parts of North China are displayed. Among them are the local silk and cloth from Hebei and Shanxi, the straw braid from the plains, the pottery and porcelain from Pengcheng, Hebei, the wooden carts and wooden boats from Beijing and Tianjin, the plowshares and plow tips from Yangquan and other places, the felt products from Chahar, and the cloisonné, jade, and ivory carvings from Beijing... Before liberation, under the rule and destruction of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the handcraft industry in North China had long been in a state of decline and decay. After liberation, with the vigorous support of the People's Government, it began to recover and develop rapidly. The porcelain kiln industry in Pengcheng, Hebei, declined sharply during the Japanese occupation. Many kilns closed down, and many workers lost their jobs. After Pengcheng was liberated in 1943, the town's porcelain industry gradually prospered, and the number of porcelain kilns in the town has now increased three times compared with before the Anti-Japanese War. In the past, only coarse porcelain could be produced, but now it has been changed to produce fine porcelain. At present, in order to better meet the needs of national construction, it has begun to produce a large number of underground water pipes and electrical materials. The reed mat industry in Hebei Province saw its annual output reduced to 20 percent of that before the Anti-Japanese War during the Japanese occupation; after the liberation of Hebei, the People's Government actively organized cooperation and marketing, and now the products are in short supply and production is rapidly increasing. The Tianjin brick and tile industry, which was almost completely destroyed by the Kuomintang government, now has an annual output of 100 million pieces more than during the period of Japanese puppet rule. The plowshares in the Yangcheng area of Shanxi used to be sold to Nepal, Bhutan, and other places. During the rule of the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek, it had greatly declined. Now the domestic sales channels are gradually recovering, and handicraftsmen are beginning to organize themselves to expand production. Last year, there were 350 iron furnaces in Jincheng, which has increased to 400 this year. The automobile copper sleeves, which had been dependent on imports from the United States before liberation, have been successfully trial-produced by workers in Tianjin. The quality is solid and durable, better than American products, and the price is less than one-third of that of American products. In the textile industry, "yarn tubes," which had long been dependent on foreign imports, have also been successfully trial-produced in North China, and mass production has begun to meet the needs of yarn mills. The wooden cart and boat industry and the vegetable knife industry in Tianjin saw a sharp decline in sales before liberation due to the Kuomintang government's restrictions on product exports. Business owners were forced to use bad wood and bad iron to manufacture shoddy products in order to maintain business. Now they are changing to use good materials for manufacturing, improving quality, and gradually restoring their previous reputation and sales. The straw braid, which was once unsalable last year due to the blockade by American imperialism, has now opened up a vast domestic market and a market in people's democratic countries under the leadership of the People's Government. In order to break the blockade of American imperialism, the carpet industry, which has long enjoyed a high reputation abroad, is now starting to switch to making kang carpets, saddles, etc., in order to open up domestic sales channels.
    In order to overcome the decentralization and backwardness of handcraft production, many handcraft industries have adopted the methods of joint operations and cooperation. According to incomplete statistics, more than 200 production teams, more than 300 production cooperatives, and a number of cooperative factories have now been organized in North China. One-sixth of the small-scale handicraft industries in Tianjin have organized joint operations. The main ones are joint purchases and joint sales, and some also implement joint production. Some joint operation cooperatives with fewer households and smaller turnovers do not have fixed sites and staff, and the joint operation business is done by each household. Some joint operation cooperatives with a larger number of households have fixed sites and staff, and the leadership is also more sound. The People's Government provides these joint operation organizations with support such as processing, ordering, loans, and purchasing products, and helps them formulate production and sales plans and establish organizations such as product inspection committees and technical research guidance committees, so that they can improve their business in a timely manner.
    The experience of Tianjin in implementing joint operations in the handcraft industry has proven that joint operation is an effective way to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, unify specifications, and improve credibility.

    应该有计划地发展手工业生产
    ——华北区城乡物资交流展览会手工业馆介绍

    扩大城乡物资交流，发展工农业生产
    手工业是华北广大农村的主要副业，在大、中、小城市的工业生产中，也占着很大的比重。土地改革后，农民的生活水平逐渐提高，对工业品的要求日益迫切。但按目前我国工业生产的情况看来，机器生产之工业品，远不能满足人民的需要。据统计，华北农民所使用的工业品中，手工业产品约占百分之八十左右；由此可见，在目前，有目的、有计划地发展手工业生产，还是非常必要的。
    在华北区城乡物资交流展览会的手工业馆里，陈列着华北各地生产的千百种手工业产品。其中有河北、山西的土绸、土布，平原的草帽辫，河北彭城的陶磁器，北京、天津的木车、木船，阳泉等地的犁面、犁铧，察哈尔的毡品，北京的景泰蓝、玉器和象牙雕刻……。解放以前，华北各地的手工业在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治和摧残下，手工业曾长期萎缩、衰落。解放以后，经过人民政府的大力扶植，开始获得迅速的恢复和发展。河北彭城的瓷窑业，在日寇侵占时期，曾经急剧衰落。很多窑关门了，很多工人失业了。一九四三年彭城解放后，该镇瓷业即逐步走向繁荣，现该镇瓷窑已比抗日战争前增加了三倍。从前只能产粗瓷，现已改产细瓷。目前更适应祖国建设的需要，开始大量生产地下水管和电料。河北省的苇席业，在日寇统治时期，年产量曾经减到抗日战争前的百分之二十；河北解放后，人民政府积极组织合作、运销，现在产品已供不应求，正在迅速增产。被国民党政府摧残殆尽的天津砖瓦业，现在年产量较日伪统治时期增加了一亿块。山西阳城一带的犁面，过去曾销至尼泊尔、不丹等地。日、蒋统治时期，曾经大大衰落。现在国内销路逐渐恢复，手工业者开始组织起来，扩大生产了。晋城的铁炉去年是三百五十个，今年增至四百个。解放以前一直依赖美国的汽车铜套，已由天津工人试制成功。品质坚实耐用，较美国货为好，价钱不及美国货的三分之一。纺织工业中过去长期依赖外国输入的“纱管”，华北也已试制成功，并已开始大量生产供应纱厂需要。天津的木车船业和菜刀业，解放以前因国民党政府限制产品出境，销路锐减。业主被迫以坏木料和坏铁料粗制滥造，维持营业。现在纷纷改用好料制造，质量提高，逐渐恢复着以前的信誉与销路。去年因美帝国主义封销而一度滞销的草帽辫，现已在人民政府领导下，开辟了广大的内销市场和人民民主国家市场。在国外久负盛誉的地毯业，为打破美帝国主义的封锁，现在开始转制炕毯、马鞍等，以开辟内销道路。
    为克服手工业生产的分散性和落后性，许多手工行业采取了联营和合作的办法。据不完全的统计，华北现在已经组织了二百多个生产小组、三百多个生产合作社，和若干合作工厂。天津市六分之一的小手工业组织了联营。其中主要的是联购、联销、也有一部分实行联产。有些户数较少、营业额不大的联营社，没有固定的社址和职员，联营业务由各户分工去做。有些户数较多的联营社，则有固定社址和职员，领导也较健全。人民政府对这些联营组织，给以加工、订货、贷款、收购产品等扶植，并帮助制定产销计划，建立成品检查委员会及技术研究指导委员会等组织，使它们能及时改进业务。
    天津市手工业实行联营的经验，已经证明联营是增加产量、提高质量、减低成本、统一规格、提高信用的有效办法。
