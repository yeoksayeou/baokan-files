Xinhua News Agency, 18th: According to delayed news from South Vietnam from the Vietnam News Agency: On September 16th, the Vietnamese People's Army units destroyed a French train between Saigon and Loc Ninh (formerly translated as Lao Ning), and repelled two reinforcing trains. They killed approximately two enemy companies, destroyed one locomotive, fourteen freight cars loaded with large quantities of military equipment and ammunition, one truck, and two armored vehicles, and captured one artillery piece and many guns and ammunition.

The railway line between Saigon and Loc Ninh is a strategically important transportation line in the Seventh War Zone, connecting Saigon, Loc Ninh, and the Han Guang area. In addition to Highway 13, the enemy uses this railway to transport troops and supplies. Since the end of last year, the Vietnamese People's Army units have launched active operations along this line, greatly striking the enemy's traffic and transportation in this area.

    越南南部人民军攻击敌交通干线获胜
    破坏法军火车一列毙敌两连
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社南越迟到消息：越南人民军部队九月十六日在西贡和禄宁（前译为老宁）之间破坏法军火车一列，并击退增援火车两列。他们击毙敌军约两连，击毁机车一辆、装有大量军事装备和军火的车皮十四辆、卡车一辆和装甲车两辆，缴获大炮一门和许多枪枝弹药。
    西贡和禄宁之间的铁路干线是第七战区具有战略意义的交通线，连接西贡、禄宁和汉光区域，除第十三号公路外，敌军利用这条铁路运输军队和物资。自从去年年底以来，越南人民军部队即在这一线上展开积极活动，大大打击了敌军在这一区域内的交通与运输。
