To the Editorial Department:

The article "Oppose Using Large Materials for Small Purposes and Long Materials for Short Lengths" published in the Economic Life Brief Comments column of the People's Daily on September 9th pointed out that our department, in the past six months or so, entrusted the Tianjin Railway Bureau Lumber Mill to process about 10,000 cubic meters of 8-meter-long logs, most of which were cut into 3 or 5-meter-long timber for use, which is a waste of timber. We believe this is indeed a major error in our material supply work, and we must strive to overcome this error in our future work.

It must be explained that the source of this batch of timber was allocated to us by the Ministry of Railways in 1950 for special projects. Later, because the task changed, this batch of timber was left unused. At the beginning of this year, because our bureau's production tasks were urgent and it was difficult to import timber from the Northeast, we repeatedly requested the Ministry of Railways before we were allowed to use this batch of timber. What should be reviewed today is that we should not have simply proceeded from the needs at the time, without calculating the details, resulting in such a huge waste of "using long materials for short lengths." This shows that we lack a high sense of responsibility for the wealth of the country and the people. We thank Comrade Li Sen for pointing out the shortcomings in our work. We are prepared to conduct an in-depth inspection of the waste of timber processing and use in our bureau in accordance with the State Council's "Instructions on Saving Timber" and formulate methods to overcome and improve it. We will immediately stop sawing the remaining "long timbers" at the lumber mill.

### 天津铁路管理局材料处改正长材短用浪费木材的作法

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    天津铁路管理局材料处改正长材短用浪费木材的作法编辑同志：
    九月九日人民日报经济生活简评栏内所刊“反对大材小用、长材短用”一文，指出了我处在半年多来委托天津铁路局制材厂加工的约一万立方公尺左右的八公尺长的原木，大部被截成三或五公尺长的木材使用，是一种浪费木材的现象。我们认为这确是材料供应工作中的重大错误，我们今后在工作中，一定要努力克服这种错误。
    必须说明，这批木料的来源是一九五○年铁道部拨给我们作专门工程使用的，后来因为任务改变，这批木料便搁置未用。今年初，因我局生产任务迫切，东北木材进口困难，经过几次向铁道部请求，才准许我们动用这批木材。今天应该检讨的是：不应单纯从当时的需要出发，不算细账，致产生如此巨大的“长材短用”的浪费，这说明我们对国家人民的财富是缺乏高度的负责精神的。感谢李森同志指正了我们工作中的缺点，我们准备按照政务院“关于节约木材的指示”，深入检查我局木材加工与使用上的浪费现象，并作出克服与改进的办法。对于制材厂剩余的“长材”，则立即停止锯制。
