    Ambassador Zhang Wentian said in his speech: "Today is the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. I believe that not only the Chinese people, but also the people of Asia and all peace-loving people around the world, are celebrating this great festival with joy and excitement. This is because the victory of the great Chinese people is not only the victory of the Chinese people, but also the victory of the Asian people and the world's peace and democracy camp. In the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, it has established an unbreakable friendly alliance with the great Soviet Union, and has established close friendly relations with all people's democratic countries and all peace-loving people in the world; it has achieved great achievements in the country's political, economic, and cultural construction; and at the same time, it has also achieved great victories in the struggle to defend peace in the Far East and oppose imperialist aggression. This has greatly enhanced the strength of the young New China and consolidated its domestic and international status. We firmly believe that this will make a significant contribution to defending peace in Asia and the Far East and to defending world lasting peace. On the other hand, the victory and achievements of the People's Republic of China are a serious blow to the arrogant plan of the American imperialists to dominate the world. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the imperialists' rule in Asia has come to an end. Precisely because of this, they are now carrying out all kinds of evil deeds and conspiracies to oppose the people of New China. However, past history and today's facts have proved, and will continue to prove in the future, that all the evil tricks of the war instigators against New China are bound to fail, and will fail even more miserably in the future! This is not only because New China itself has the strong power to defeat the aggressors, but also because it has the most reliable ally—the great Soviet Union, and the sympathy and support of all people's democratic countries, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people in the world. We firmly believe that no matter how frantic American imperialism is, we will eventually defeat the aggressors. Peace will surely triumph over war! Let us raise our glasses and wish: Long live the great People's Republic of China! Long live the great Soviet Union! Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union! Long live the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union! Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the great leader and teacher of the people of the world, Marshal Stalin!" Ambassador Zhang also asked everyone to toast to the Soviet army, to the Soviet marshals and generals, and to the health of Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Marshal Bulganin; to the health of the outstanding Soviet diplomat and loyal executor of Stalin's peaceful diplomatic policy, Foreign Minister Vyshinsky; to the health of Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers Kosygin and Bier Uxin; to the heroic Korean people, to the heroic Korean People's Army and its leader General Kim Il-sung.
    Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Marshal Bulganin, raised his glass and said: "On this solemn day, the entire Soviet people are very happy to see the achievements of the great Chinese people. I propose a toast to the great Chinese people, to the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and the great People's Republic of China, to the government of the people's China and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong's health." Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky raised his glass and said: "The friendship between the great Chinese and Soviet peoples is a consolidated friendship and a guarantee of peace in the Far East. It is becoming increasingly consolidated and powerful, and can stop the aggression of any country. To the permanent friendship between China and the Soviet Union, to the great diplomatic policy of China and the Soviet Union based on mutual respect and equality, and to the Premier and Foreign Minister of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai." The cocktail party proceeded in a friendly and warm atmosphere throughout. A dance party was held after the meeting, and it lasted until 1:00 a.m.

    张闻天大使致词说：“今天是中华人民共和国成立两周年的国庆纪念。我相信，不但中国人民，而且亚洲人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民，都以欢欣鼓舞的心情，来庆祝这一个伟大的节日。这是因为伟大的中国人民的胜利，不只是中国人民的胜利，而且也是亚洲人民及世界和平民主阵营的胜利。中华人民共和国建国两年来，在中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，已和伟大的苏联建立了牢不可破的友好同盟，和各人民民主国家及全世界一切爱好和平的人民建立了亲密的友好关系；在全国政治、经济、文化建设方面获得了巨大的成就；同时在保卫远东和平反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中也获得了巨大的胜利。这大大地增强了年青的新中国的力量，巩固了它在国内与国际的地位。我们深信，这对于保卫亚洲与远东和平，对于保卫世界持久和平，是会有重大的贡献的。另一方面，中华人民共和国的胜利与成就，对于美帝国主义者统治世界的狂妄计划，是一个严重的打击。自中华人民共和国成立以来，帝国主义者在亚洲的统治已经走到穷途末路了。正因为如此，它们现在正在进行一切罪恶的行为及阴谋诡计，来反对新中国的人民。然而，过去的历史及今天的事实已经证明，并且今后还要证明，战争挑拨者反对新中国的一切罪恶伎俩，是一定要失败的，而且今后还要失败得更惨！这不但是因为新中国自己有强大的力量能够打败侵略者，而且还有最可信赖的盟友——伟大的苏联，和各人民民主国家、亚洲人民及世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情与支援。我们深信，不管美帝国主义如何疯狂，我们必能最后战胜侵略者。和平定将战胜战争！让我们举杯敬祝：伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！伟大的苏联万岁！中苏两国伟大的牢不可破的友谊万岁！以苏联为首的和平民主阵营万岁！中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！全世界人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林大元帅万岁！”张大使并请大家为苏联军队、为苏联元帅和将军们、为苏联部长会议副主席布尔加宁元帅的健康干杯；为杰出的苏联外交家、斯大林和平外交政策的忠实执行者维辛斯基外长的健康干杯；为部长会议副主席柯西金和别尔乌辛的健康干杯；为英勇的朝鲜人民、为英勇的朝鲜人民军及其领袖金日成将军干杯。
    苏联部长会议副主席布尔加宁元帅举杯说：“在今天这个隆重的日子里，全苏联人民非常高兴地注视着伟大的中国人民的成就。我提议为伟大的中国人民、为苏联与伟大的中华人民共和国之间的牢不可破的友谊、为人民中国的政府及其领袖毛泽东同志的健康干杯。”苏联外交部长维辛斯基举杯说：“伟大的中苏人民之间的友谊，是巩固的友谊，是远东和平的保证。它日益巩固、强大，能够制止住任何国家的侵略。为中苏两国永久的友谊、为建基于互相尊重与平等的中苏两国伟大的外交政策、为中华人民共和国政务院周恩来总理兼外长干杯。”酒会始终在友好热烈的气氛中进行。会后举行了舞会，直至深夜一时始尽欢而散。
