    Bitterly Fighting the British 29th Brigade on Ma Liang Mountain
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Yun
    At the end of September, the commander of the British Commonwealth Division inspected the front-line troops three times. This ominous sign made every British soldier uneasy. They knew they were going to be driven somewhere to die again. Sure enough, soon Van Fleet announced the "Autumn Offensive." The British Commonwealth Division was assembled on the Imjin River front west of Yeoncheon to participate in the offensive. The 29th Brigade of the division was tasked with attacking Ma Liang Mountain, about twelve kilometers from Yeoncheon. The mountains, with Ma Liang Mountain as their peak, are only two to three hundred meters high and stretch along the right bank of the Imjin River. In the five days and nights that the British 29th Brigade attacked here, they suffered more than 2,600 casualties to advance only two kilometers.
    On October 3rd, the British troops launched an offensive. The enemy's main target of attack was the 216.8 height southwest of Ma Liang Mountain. When dealing with this height, the enemy concentrated more than thirty artillery pieces, eighteen tanks, and twelve aircraft. A company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers defended this position. Many soldiers in this company had won honors for their outstanding achievements in annihilating the British 29th Brigade during the counterattack in late April. Therefore, when the soldiers heard that the enemy in front of them was actually their defeated enemy, they all beamed with joy and said, "They've come at just the right time!" The fierce battle here lasted for five days. In fact, apart from the first three days when the soldiers could still see the enemy, they only heard the sound of artillery shells and bombs exploding around them for the last two days. In the last two days, the 6th and 7th, nearly 40,000 artillery shells were poured onto this position, and more than 1,000 bombs fell on the 6th alone. But our soldiers were safely hidden in clever and solid fortifications, resting for two days. Some played chess, some played cards, and some read books and newspapers.
    The battle on the first day went like this: In the morning, after the enemy bombarded the mountaintop with more than 5,000 artillery shells, more than 500 infantrymen swarmed up the mountain. The soldiers hid in the forward fortifications and waited calmly. Only when the enemy climbed up the hillside did all kinds of firearms suddenly open fire, killing and wounding more than half of the enemy. The remaining enemies rolled and crawled down the mountain.
    Around noon, the enemy launched a second attack. This time, the attacking enemy had increased to more than 1,000 men. The soldiers fought the enemy bravely and accurately. Light machine gunner Li Fu hugged his machine gun and fired at the enemy, firing twenty-five bullets and knocking down twenty-one enemies. Automatic rifleman Liu Xueke charged into the enemy ranks alone. More than a dozen enemies pounced on him densely. He threw a grenade and killed eight enemies. Taking advantage of the thick smoke from the explosion, he charged into another group of enemies, holding his submachine gun and sweeping at the enemy, knocking more than thirty enemies down at his feet. At this moment, an enemy thrown incendiary bomb exploded in front of him, and five enemies followed closely. The incendiary bomb burned his hair and clothes. While putting out the flames, he threw another grenade at the enemy, and then picked up a machine gun discarded by the enemy and turned to fire at another group of enemies. After a fierce battle, the enemy's second attack was repulsed, and more than 300 corpses were left in front of our army's position. On this day, the Volunteer soldiers also shot down and damaged three enemy planes with machine guns and automatic rifles.
    The enemy never expected that capturing this hilltop would require such heavy casualties. By the third day, the enemy had concentrated more than sixty tanks attacking nearby hills, covering the assault of more than 1,000 infantrymen. The Volunteer Army's artillery then showed its power. When the enemy's tanks climbed to the shooting range at the foot of the mountain, the artillery bombarded them together. Shells fell one after another into the enemy tank group, and twelve tanks immediately caught fire. More than 180 enemies were killed next to the burning tanks. The infantrymen, lying in the fortifications, couldn't help but cheer: "Well done! Give our artillery comrades credit!"
    The enemy's attack on the Ma Liang Mountain position, after five days and nights of bloody fighting, only managed to climb onto the hilltop, littered with piles of British corpses everywhere, after the Volunteers took the initiative to withdraw.
    This was the third serious blow suffered by the British 29th Brigade on the Korean battlefield. At the beginning of this year, the brigade was used by the US military to cover its retreat, and a tank battalion was annihilated near Uijeongbu; in our army's counterattack in late April, the brigade was placed by the US military on the Imjin River front to take the brunt of the attack, and more than 3,000 people were killed or wounded in the Dongducheon southeast area alone; this time, it was beaten to a pulp by the increasingly strong Volunteer soldiers. When the Volunteer soldiers cleaned up the battlefield after this battle, they found that the British soldiers who were killed were still wearing summer clothes. One soldier said: "They are selling their lives for Truman, and now that it's getting cold, they can't even wear cotton clothes." The British soldiers and American soldiers on the Korean battlefield are trembling as they watch another terrible winter approaching them step by step.

    马良山上痛打英军二十九旅
    新华社记者  路云
    九月末，英国联邦师师长三度到前线部队视察，这个不祥之兆，使每个英国士兵都不安起来。他们知道自己又要被赶到什么地方去送死了。果然，不久范佛里特宣布了“秋季攻势”。英国联邦师部队就被调集在涟川以西的临津江前线参加了进攻，该师第二十九旅担负了向距涟川约十二公里的马良山攻击的任务。以马良山为顶峰的群山不过二、三百公尺高，它绵亘在临津江右岸。英军二十九旅在这里进攻的五昼夜中，付出了二千六百多人的伤亡，才前进了两公里。
    十月三日，英国军队发动了进攻。敌人进攻的重点是马良山西南的二一六点八高地。敌人在对付这个高地时集中了三十多门大炮、十八辆坦克和十二架飞机。中国人民志愿军某部一个连守卫着这个阵地。该连的许多战士曾在四月下旬反击战中因痛歼英军二十九旅战绩卓著而荣立功勋。因此战士们听说当面的敌人原来是自己的手下败兵，个个都不由得眉飞色舞地说：“来得正好！”激战在这里整整进行了五天，其实战士们除了前三天还能看到敌人以外，后两天就只听到炮弹和炸弹在周围的轰炸声了。在六日和七日的最后两天中，倾泻在这阵地上的炮弹差不多有四万发，六日这一天落的炸弹就有一千颗以上。而我们的战士们却安稳地隐蔽在巧妙而坚固的工事里，休息了两天。他们有的下棋，有的玩扑克，有的翻阅书报。
    第一天的战斗经过是这样的：早晨，当敌人向这座山顶轰击了五千多发炮弹之后，五百多个步兵就涌上山来。战士们隐蔽在前沿工事里镇定地等待着，直等到敌人爬到山坡时，各种火器一齐突然开火，一下就打死打伤敌人一半多。剩下的敌人连滚带爬地逃下山去了。
    中午时分，敌人又开始了第二次冲锋。这次进攻的敌人已增加到一千多人。战士们勇猛而准确地痛打敌人。轻机枪手李福抱住机枪向敌人点发，射击二十五发子弹，就打倒二十一个敌人。自动枪手刘学科只身冲进敌群，十多个敌人密集地向他扑来，他打出一颗手榴弹就炸死了八个敌人。乘着浓密的弹烟，他又冲进另一群敌人中间，端着冲锋枪向敌人猛扫，把三十多个敌人打倒在他的脚下。这时，在他面前爆炸了一颗手掷燃烧弹，五个敌人紧跟着冲过来，燃烧弹烧着了他的头发和衣裳。他一边扑灭火苗，一边又向敌人抛出一颗手榴弹，乘势又拾起敌人丢弃的一挺机枪，转向另一群敌人射击。经过一场激战，敌人的第二次冲锋被打退了，三百多个死尸丢弃在我军的阵地面前。这一天，志愿军战士们还用机关枪和自动步枪打落打伤三架敌机。
    敌人料想不到夺取这个山头要付出如此重大的伤亡。到第三天，敌人把进攻附近几座山头的六十多辆坦克集中起来，掩护一千多名步兵冲锋。志愿军的炮兵这时就大显威风，等到敌人的坦克爬到山下的射击威力圈内，大炮一齐轰击起来。炮弹一颗接一颗落在敌人坦克群中，立刻有十二辆坦克中弹起火，一百八十多个敌人被炸死在燃烧着的坦克旁边。步兵们伏在工事里不禁欢呼起来：“打的好呵！给我们的炮兵同志记功呀！”
    敌人向马良山阵地的进攻，经五昼夜流血战斗，只有在志愿军主动撤离以后，才爬上了到处躺着一堆堆英国人尸体的山头。
    这一次是英军二十九旅在朝鲜战场上受到的第三次严重打击。在今年初，该旅被美军用来掩护自己的撤退，在议政府附近被歼灭了一个坦克营；在我军四月下旬的反击战中，该旅被美军放在临津江前线挡头阵，仅在东豆川东南地区，被杀伤达三千多人；这次又被愈战愈强的志愿军战士们打得头破血流。志愿军战士在这次战斗中打扫战场的时候，发现被打死的英国士兵还只穿着夏季的服装。一位战士说：“他们替杜鲁门卖命，现在天冷了竟连棉衣也穿不上。”在朝鲜战场上的英国士兵与美国士兵们，正战栗地眼看着又一个可怕的冬天向他们一步步走来。
