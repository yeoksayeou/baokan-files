In our great motherland, which boasts a long history and abundant resources, many working people in the past had many discoveries and creations in the actual struggle of life. Fruit tree cultivation is one of them. We once discovered excellent varieties such as Dangshan Pear, Feicheng Peach, Fang Persimmon, Chinese Dates, and Guaglue Lychee. We also created the earliest record of "grafting." However, in the old society, the creations of the working people were not valued by the reactionary ruling class, and their genius did not have "the conditions for expression and development." Therefore, we did not have a Michurin, let alone Michurin's theory.

As stated in the reviser's note of this book, "The large-scale and widespread introduction of Michurin's theory in China began after the liberation of Beijing." The first introductions were "booklets and magazine articles." As a result, some people blindly doubted whether it was a "theory," and some even maliciously spread rumors that the large apples in the movie "Michurin's Biography" were fake, while most people eagerly awaited something they thought was a miracle at the time. The systematic introduction of Michurin's and Lysenko's theories aims to arm ourselves.

Thanks to the collective efforts of many colleagues at the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, under the supervision and encouragement of Director Chen Fengtong, and with the revision of comrades Zu Deming, Dai Songen, and Ye Duzhuang, this Chinese translation of the original work, a "systematic introduction," was completed within six months. This is a huge contribution to the Chinese people's scientific community.

This contribution is entirely timely and entirely necessary. Because it can enable thousands upon thousands of Michurin's successors in the motherland to move forward in his direction, and because, in the face of its eloquent facts, no one can doubt that it is not a theory or a genuine theory that meets the needs of the people.

First, we must carefully study P.N. Yakovlev's original preface. In the preface, he pointed out that "the key point of Michurin's theory is not, as the representatives of bourgeois formal genetics deliberately distort and mistakenly assert, hybridization. The key point, the basic principle, of Michurin's theory is the role played by the environment and the directed education of hybrids." "The nature of a variety begins to form from the earliest stage of seed development; and during this period, it will most easily change in the intended direction according to the situation of education." Therefore, "external conditions have a decisive effect on the formation of organisms," and organisms have a "holistic and inseparable relationship" with the environment. By mastering this principle and starting from this principle, Michurin discovered and developed many methods in continuous and arduous practice, such as "hybridizing various plants that are geographically distant" and "purposefully educating hybrid seedlings." Michurin was able to overthrow many outdated "theories" in horticulture in the past, advance the positive aspects of Darwin's theory of evolution, and create a new materialist biology.

By reading this collection of works, we can progressively understand the history of Michurin's life's career development, the principles and methods he discovered and applied, the breeding procedures of the main varieties he created, and the pomological descriptions of those varieties. Finally, we can also see the essays written by Michurin in a very short and concise style.

In the autobiographical materials, the most important part is "My Sixty Years of Work Summary and Future Prospects." From here, we can see that his entire path was "filled with ridicule, neglect, and contempt." He had "spent enormous energy, done extremely hard physical labor, and suffered many hardships," but he still "realized his established aspirations in the face of extreme lack of money," which was to establish horticulture in central and northern Russia, "which had not made any progress since ancient times," "to increase the types of fruit trees and berries in the central region with high-yield and excellent-quality varieties, and to extend the southern crop cultivation area far to the north." He failed more than once. He tried "transplanting southern plants to the central region to gradually adapt them to the conditions of the region," "grafting southern varieties onto cold-resistant wild plants," educating and selecting excellent seedlings of local and foreign varieties, mass selection, and artificial hybridization of pairs of parent plants from local varieties, etc. But he finally found an absolutely correct path—hybridization between plant races of distant origins, and later discovered many hybridization methods. In the first twenty years, he patiently endured the pain caused by many wrong methods, but after finding the correct method, by 1935, he had cultivated more than three hundred fruit tree varieties. He had experienced it in "two worlds," but his "lonely mood disappeared after the revolution." In 1932 alone, he "completed the same amount of work as he had done in the entire previous decade." He lived to eighty years old and worked for sixty years, forty-three of which were spent under the dark Tsarist rule. However, the Communist Party and the working class gave him everything he needed, making his life's dreams come true. Sixty years of work became increasingly inseparable from the masses.

The "Principles and Methods" section is the most brilliant part of the entire book. It contains the summary of his forty-seven years of work and the summary of his fifty years of work. In each summary, he increasingly developed correct theories and methods from continuous practice, and thus gained more and more achievements. At the same time, he was able to make more profound criticisms and reviews of Mendel's genetics and other idealistic working methods. Criticizing Grel's method of fruit tree domestication, criticizing Mendel's law, criticizing "the erroneous concept of many experts regarding the possibility of asexual hybrids," and reviewing the recent "achievements" in genetics—these are one aspect. Developing hybridization methods, applying the "conductor" method, and finding out the laws of educating hybrid seedlings, "using various methods to make hybridization work easier," and carrying out distant hybridization (interspecific and intergeneric) and asexual proximity—these are another aspect. Rich ideation is interspersed in all of his work. He always insisted that "the form of life is not frozen and fixed, life is in constant movement and continuous change, and all organisms that stop developing for some reason will inevitably be eliminated and become extinct." Therefore, he insisted on constantly producing new improved varieties, constantly creating new methods, and constantly summarizing his own experiences. But he also had ideas that went beyond these, that is, the often-quoted, "We cannot sit and wait for the gifts of nature, we should strive for nature."

"Michurin's Variety Breeding Procedures and Pomological Descriptions" are more specific and specialized, containing the various main varieties of apples, pears, cherries, plums, apricots, grapes, and other small fruits that he created. Unlike general pomological descriptions, each variety has its own history of creation. Moreover, the descriptions are also very vivid, proving that Michurin's theory is irrefutable.

In the essays, Michurin conducted correct and serious propaganda to horticulturists, fruit tree cultivators, shock workers, rationalization workers, Communist Youth League members, collective farm youths, and even children throughout the Soviet Union. He tirelessly taught individual horticulturists, and also placed infinite hope on the entire younger generation of amateur horticulturists, hoping that they would "enrich nature" and realize his "life's dream." He fully realized that "science can only become a force after it is popularized," and only by the power of the masses can "the firmly established order of plant life be changed and a new order be established—so that they can be more suitable for human needs." From the fact that the youth expedition team discovered "many fundamentally unknown or known but unutilized plants suitable for breeding and cultivation purposes" within five hundred kilometers of the Altai Mountains, he had already seen the beautiful scenery of a communist society like the rising sun.

The translation of this book is as fluent, sharp, and vivid as the original. The comparative shortcomings are in the translation of specialized terms. Because it was not possible to get more contact with botanists during the translation process, and of course, because botanists generally have not fully recognized the importance of Michurin's theory and have not been able to actively cooperate in the work, some translations in the translation are wrong or inappropriate. For example, Andou cherry is *Prunus humilis*, Siberian wild apricot is mountain apricot, *Amygdalns Kansuensis* should be translated as Gansu almond, Chitaiyka apple is crabapple, should be translated as Chinese apple, *Amur Cork tree* cannot be translated as Heilongjiang rubber tree, it should be translated as *Phellodendron amurense*, Raspberry is generally called *Rubus*, cannot be translated as tree raspberry, etc. Some nouns have not been completely unified before and after. I will make detailed suggestions separately for these so that they can be corrected in the reprint.

Only Lenin and Stalin—the great revolutionary leaders of the people of the world—could discover Michurin and enable the immortal cause of Michurin's transformation of nature to be grasped in the hands of millions of people and transformed into a huge material force. In today's New China, the introduction of this advanced theory through this masterpiece is a good start. Thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we will certainly be able to combine it with China's actual situation and further promote Michurin's cause. All Michurin workers in China, work harder!

    介绍《米丘林选集》
    中国科学院植物分类研究所副所长吴征镒《米丘林选集》华北农业科学研究所译  祖德明、戴松恩、叶笃庄校  人民出版社出版
    在有着悠久历史和丰饶物产的我们的伟大的祖国里，过去有过许多劳动人民，在实际生活斗争中曾经有过许多发现和创造。果树栽培就是其中之一。我们曾经发现过砀山梨、肥城桃、方柿、大枣、挂绿荔枝等等优良的品种。我们也曾经创造过最早的“移花接木”的纪录。但是在旧社会里，劳动人民的创造是没有被反动的统治阶级重视的，他们的天才也没有“表现和发展的条件”，因此我们没有米丘林，更没有米丘林的学说。
    正如本书校译记中所说，“关于米丘林学说在中国之被大量的和广泛的介绍，还是北京解放以后的事”，而首先介绍进来的又是些“小册子和杂志文章”，因此有些人便盲目地怀疑它是不是“学说”，有些人甚至恶意地传说“米丘林传”电影里那样大的苹果是假的，而大部分人则热烈地期待着一种当时以为是奇迹的事情。米丘林和李森科学说的系统介绍，为的是可以武装自己。
    感谢华北农业科学研究所许多工作同志的集体努力，在该所陈凤桐所长督促和鼓励之下，在祖德明、戴松恩、叶笃庄等同志校订之下，这样一部“系统介绍”原著的中译本在六个月内便完工了。这是中国人民科学界的一个巨大的贡献。
    这个贡献是完全合乎时宜的，而且是完全适合需要的。因为它可以使祖国千千万万的米丘林工作的后继者向着他的方向前进，因为在它的胜于雄辩的事实面前，没有人再能怀疑它不是学说或不是真正的、合乎人民需要的学说。
    首先，我们必需很仔细地学习Π．Ｈ．雅考烈夫的原版序言，在序言中他指出“米丘林学说的要点，并不像资产阶级形式遗传学的代表们故意歪曲地和错误地武断为杂交。米丘林学说的要点，基本的原理，就是环境所起的作用，以及有定向地去教育杂种”。“一个品种的本性，从种籽发育的最初时期，就开始形成；并且在这期间，它将依照教育的情形，循着所预期的方向，最容易发生变化”。因此“外界条件对于有机体的形成，是有决定的作用的”，有机体和环境有着一种“整体而不可分离的关系”。由于掌握了这一原理，并从这一原理出发，米丘林在不断的艰苦的实践中发现和发展了许多方法，例如，“使地理上距离远的各种植物进行杂交”，“对杂种的苗木加以有目的的教育”等等，米丘林才有可能把过去许多园艺学上的过时“理论”推翻，并且把达尔文进化论的积极一面向前发展，创立了唯物论的新生物学。
    读了这一本选集，我们可以顺序渐进地了解米丘林一生事业发展的历史，他所发现所应用的原理和方法，他所创造的主要品种的育种程序和那些品种的果树学的描述。最后还可以见到米丘林以很短小精悍的笔调写出来的杂文。
    在自传资料里，最重要的一部分是“我的六十年工作总结及将来的展望”。从这里我们可以看出：他的全部道路上，曾经“布满了嘲笑，忽视和轻蔑”，他曾经“费去了何等巨大的精力，做到了何等刻苦的体力劳动，遭受了何等繁多的艰辛困苦”，但还“在金钱极端缺乏的情况下，去实现既定的志愿”，那就是把“自古以来就没有进展过一步的”俄罗斯中部和北部的园艺建立起来，“用高产量而品质优异的品种去增加中部地区的果树与浆果的种类，把南方作物栽培区远向北方伸展”。他不止一次地失败了，他试过“把南部植物移植到中部，使它逐渐适应该地区的条件”，“把南方品种嫁接在抗寒的野生植物上”，对本地品种和外国品种的优异实生苗木加以教育和选择，大量选种，从本地品种中选出一对对的亲本植物施行人工杂交等等。但他终于找到了一条绝对正确的途径——远距离原产地的植物种族间进行杂交，并且以后又发现了许多杂交方法。在前二十年中他耐心忍受许多错误方法给他的痛苦，但在找到了正确方法以后，到一九三五年，他已培育了三百个以上的果树品种。他是在“两个世界”中经历过来的，然而他的“孤独心情在革命后消失了”。单在一九三二年这一年他就“完成了以前整整十年所作的同量的工作”。他活到八十岁，工作了六十年，四十三年在黑暗的沙皇统治下度过，然而共产党和工人阶级给了他所需要的一切，使他一生的梦境因之实现。六十年来的工作也愈和群众结合在一起而不可分离了。
    原理和方法这一大段是全书里最精彩的部分。这里面包含着他四十七年中工作的总结和五十年中工作的总结。在每一次的总结里，他从不断的实践中愈益发展了正确的理论和方法，也就愈益获得了更多的成就，同时对孟德尔遗传学以及其他的唯心论的工作方法也就愈能做出更深刻的批判和检讨。从这里我们可以非常清楚地看出米丘林学说发展的过程。批判了葛勒尔的果树驯化方法，批判了孟德尔定律，批判了“许多专家们对于无性杂种可能性的错误观念”，检讨了遗传学上的最近“成就”——这些是一方面。发展杂交方法，应用“传导者”方法，找出教育杂种苗木的规律。“用种种方法使杂交工作容易成功”进行远缘杂交（种间与属间）及无性接近——这些又是一方面。在他的一切工作里面，都贯串着丰富的思想性。他始终坚持着“生命的形式不是冻结的和固定的，生命是在不断地运动和连续地变化中，一切生物，凡是因某些缘由，停止了发展，那必然地要归于淘汰而告绝迹”，因此他坚持着不断产生新的改良品种，不断创造新的方法，同时也不断总结自己的经验。但他还有超过于这些的思想，即是大家常常引用的，“我们不能坐待大自然的恩赐，我们应当向大自然争取”。
    “米丘林品种的育种程序和果树学的描述”是较为具体而专门的，包含着他所创造的关于苹果、梨、樱桃、李、杏、葡萄，以及其他小果类的各种主要品种。和一般果树学的描述不一样，每一品种都有其创造的历史。而且描述也非常生动，证明了米丘林学说是颠扑不破的。
    在杂文里面，米丘林向全苏各地的园艺家、果树栽培者、突击工人、合理化工作者、共青团团员、集体农庄的青年们，甚至于儿童们进行了正确而严肃的宣传。他孜孜不倦地教导着个别的园艺家们，同时也寄无穷希望于整个青年一代的业余园艺家，希望他们“把自然丰富起来”；实现他的“生活梦景”。他完全认识到“科学只有大众化了以后才能成为一种力量”，才能靠大众的力量“把稳固建立起来的植物生活秩序加以改变，并且建立一个新的秩序——以便使他们更能适于人类的需要”。从青年远征队在阿尔泰山区五百公里以内发现“许多根本不知道的或是已知道而没有被利用的适于育种和栽培目的的植物”这一事实，他已经看到人类共产主义社会如日中天的美景了。
    本书的译文也正如原文一样是流畅，锋利而生动的。比较成为缺陷的是在专门名词的翻译方面。由于在翻译过程中没有能和植物学家取得更多的联系，当然也由于植物学家们一般还没有充分认识到米丘林学说的重要性，没有能主动地去配合工作，译文中有些译名是错误的或不妥当的，例如安都樱桃就是山豆子，西伯利亚野生杏就是山杏，坎寻西斯种桃Amygdalns Kansuensis应译甘肃扁桃，基泰伊卡苹果即海棠果种，应译中国苹果，Amur Cork tree不能译为黑龙江橡皮树，应译作黄柏，Raspberry通叫藨（泡），不能译作树莓等等。有些名词前后也还未能完全统一。对于这些我当另外作详细的建议，以便在再版时修正。
    只有列宁、斯大林——全世界人民的伟大革命领袖——才能发现了米丘林，并使不朽的、米丘林改造自然的事业能掌握在千百万人民大众的手里，把它化为巨大的物质的力量。在今天的新中国，这个先进的理论能通过这本巨著介绍进来便是一个良好的开端。由于毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导，我们一定能够结合中国的实际，把米丘林的事业更发扬光大起来。全中国的米丘林工作者更加努力吧！
