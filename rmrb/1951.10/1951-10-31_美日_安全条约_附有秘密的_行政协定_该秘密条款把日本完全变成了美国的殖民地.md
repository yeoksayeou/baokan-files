Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 30th: Tokyo News: The US-Japan "Security Treaty," signed in early September in San Francisco, was accompanied by a secret so-called "Administrative Agreement." The provisions in the "Administrative Agreement" regarding so-called "general rights" thoroughly undermine Japan's independence and sovereignty, and nakedly expose the United States' conspiracy to continue its long-term occupation of Japan. The "Administrative Agreement" regarding "general rights" is as follows:

General Rights: The United States enjoys the following rights with respect to base construction and other aspects; rights outside the base are to be determined by the "US-Japan Joint Committee"; when a base is not in use, it will also be decided by the "US-Japan Joint Committee" and then handed over to the Japanese side for management:

	(1) Security: Japan must have the necessary legislative procedures to ensure the safety of the garrison.
	(2) Jurisdiction: The United States has jurisdiction over the garrison inside and outside the base and over criminals within the base (except when the murderer and victim are both Japanese).
	(3) Right of Arrest: The United States may freely exercise the right of arrest and search within the base. The Japanese side is limited to executing instructions upon obtaining permission from the garrison headquarters.
	(4) Hearing: American lawyers may appear in Japanese courts to hear cases involving the garrison.
	(5) Handover: Japanese criminals within the base must be handed over to Japan with the consent of the United States.
	(6) Use of Equipment and Services: The United States has the right to use Japanese domestic highways and employ services.
	(7) Surveying: The United States has surveying rights inside and outside the base.
	(8) Transportation: General lighthouses are used by Japan. Bases subject to maritime law are regarded as Japanese territory, but the Japanese side must exempt automobile tax and transportation tax.
	(9) Treatment: Japanese people employed within the base are not to be treated as immigrants.
	(10) Tariffs: No import tax is levied on goods transported to the base, but buying and selling in Japan is prohibited. Those working within the base are not taxed unless their income comes from Japan.
	(11) Communications: The establishment of communications liaison offices within the base must be approved by the "US-Japan Joint Committee." Post offices may be established within the base.
	(12) Business: No business other than repair business may be conducted within the base.
	(13) Garrisons outside the base: With the understanding of the Japanese government, garrisons outside the base shall enjoy the same privileges as those within the base. Healthcare for garrisons outside the base will be handled in consultation with the Japanese government.
	(14) Abandonment: Bases or facilities within the base may be abandoned or moved at any time.
	(15) Reservation: Mining rights within the base belong to Japan.
	(16) Supplementary Contracts: Supplementary land outside the base may be leased with the consent of the "US-Japan Joint Committee."
	(17) Amendments: The "US-Japan Joint Committee" has the right to amend this "Administrative Agreement."

Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: Tokyo News: The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" published on October 17th an interview between a senior official of the Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a reporter from the newspaper. This interview clearly exposed how the secret clauses of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" savagely trampled on Japan's independent sovereignty and turned Japan into a US colony and military base. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said: After the US-Japan "Security Treaty" comes into effect, "American military ships and military aircraft will be able to use Japanese seaports and air force base facilities at will." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said that these bases are "rented free of charge," but the "construction and maintenance costs" of these bases will be "shared by the United States and Japan." He also said that with the "permission" of the Japanese government in advance, American troops can be transferred out of their bases for exercises. In addition, Japan will also exempt all taxes on American supplies and equipment imported into Japan in the name of providing for and maintaining the US military stationed in Japan.

In order to implement the "Security Treaty," the United States and Japan will form a joint committee, and the chairman of the committee will "probably be the US ambassador to Tokyo." This committee will not only have the power to deal with the so-called "public security facility issues," but will also "make on-the-spot decisions" on issues such as finance, construction, transportation, and liaison between the US and Japanese governments. At the same time, this committee can also make additional agreements to make specific provisions on how the US military uses Japanese airports, seaports, highways, railways, etc.

The secret clauses of the "Security Treaty" also stipulate that Japan has the "obligation" to carry out so-called "counter-espionage" work for the United States. To this end, the Japanese "police" will be under the command of the United States. The official said that Japan may "support" the US military police with Japanese police when necessary.

The official also revealed that the US military stationed in Japan enjoys extraterritoriality. He said that the United States and Japan have agreed that the US military authorities have the right to adjudicate disputes between Americans and Japanese within the US military base area. Even if an American soldier is accused of committing a crime outside the US military base area, as long as he "is on military orders or engaged in urgent public security work," the Japanese court has no right to interrogate him.

    该秘密条款把日本完全变成了美国的殖民地
    【新华社上海三十日电】东京消息：九月初在旧金山签订的美日“安全条约”中，曾附有秘密的所谓“行政协定”。该“行政协定”中关于所谓“一般权利”部分的规定，彻底地破坏了日本的独立和主权，赤裸裸地暴露了美国继续长期占领日本的阴谋。“行政协定”中关于“一般权利”的部分如下：
    一般权利：美国对于基地建设及其他方面享有下列权利，基地以外之权利由“美日联合委员会”决定，基地不使用时亦经“美日联合委员会”决定，然后交由日本方面管理：

    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：日本资产阶级报纸“读卖新闻”十月十七日发表了吉田政府外务省高级官员对该报记者的一篇谈话。这篇谈话清楚地暴露了美日“安全条约”的秘密条款，是如何野蛮地蹂躏了日本的独立主权，把日本变为美国的殖民地与军事基地。该外务省官员说：美日“安全条约”生效以后，“美国的军用舰只和军用飞机将可随意使用日本的海港和空军基地设备”。该外务省官员说：这些基地是“免费出租的”，但这些基地的“建设费和维持费”，则是由美日“两国分担”。他又说：只要事先得到了日本政府的“允许”，美国部队可以调出他们的基地，进行演习。此外，日本也将豁免以供养和维持驻日美军为名而输入日本的美国供应品和装备的一切赋税。
    为了履行“安全条约”，美国和日本将组成一个联合委员会，委员会主席“大概由美国驻东京大使担任”。这个委员会不仅有权处理所谓“治安设施问题”，并将就财政、建设、运输和美日政府间联络等问题，“就地作出决定”。同时，这个委员会还可以另订协议，作出关于美军如何使用日本机场、海港、公路、铁路等的具体规定。
    “安全条约”的秘密条款并规定，日本有“义务”为美国进行所谓“反间谍”工作，为此，日本“警察”将受美国的指挥。该官员说：日本于必要时并得以日本警察“支持”美国的军事警察。
    该官员并透露驻日美军享有治外法权。他说：美日双方已经同意美国军事当局有权裁判在美军基地范围内的美国人和日本人之间的争端。即使是在美军基地地区以外被控犯了罪行的美国军人，只要他“有军令在身或从事紧急治安工作”，日本法院就无权予以审讯。
