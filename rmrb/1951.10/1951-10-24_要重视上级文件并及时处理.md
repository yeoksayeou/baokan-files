    Letter Summary:

    Attach Importance to and Promptly Handle Documents from Higher Levels
    In Changde County, Hunan Province, some comrades do not pay enough attention to the proclamations issued by higher authorities. For example, Li Xiangyu, a clerk in the 13th District of the county, cut up the proclamation from the Changde Special District Office regarding "Patriotic Cotton Bumper Harvest Competition Reward Measures" into small pieces to make registration forms. Some comrades also accumulate documents, such as Tang Zhengwen, the secretary of the 10th District, who accumulated important documents related to land reform for more than twenty days. This is an irresponsible attitude towards the people and should be corrected immediately, and should also attract the attention of other regions.

专栏：来信摘要

    要重视上级文件并及时处理
    湖南省常德县有些同志对上级颁发的布告不予以重视。如该县十三区文书李向愚把常德专署关于“爱国主义棉花丰产竞赛奖励办法”的布告，裁成小块造表册使用。有些同志则积压文件，如十区秘书唐政文把有关土地改革的重要文件积压了二十多天。这都是对人民不负责的态度，亟应纠正，并应引起其他各地的注意。
