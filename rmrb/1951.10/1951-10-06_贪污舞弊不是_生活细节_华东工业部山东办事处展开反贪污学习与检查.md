    Graft and Embezzlement are Not "Minor Details"
    The East China Industrial Department's Shandong Office Launches Anti-Corruption Study and Inspection

    Editor:
    Since the People's Daily published the collective embezzlement case of Lu Yuan and Fan Gang, the chief and deputy section chiefs of the Jinan Industrial Bureau's Business Section, and ten others on July 18th, the East China Industrial Department's Shandong Office has launched an anti-corruption study and inspection.

    During the study, it was discovered that Jiang Hanzhong, the deputy section chief of the office's supply section, and others frequently wined and dined with unscrupulous merchants and engaged in graft and bribery. According to preliminary statistics, they have accepted bribes such as daily necessities, radios, and cash totaling more than 3 million yuan, and embezzled 1 million yuan. In November of last year, Jiang Hanzhong colluded with the unscrupulous merchant Hei Lianxun to engage in private gain and malpractice, spending 700,000 yuan on a single eating and drinking session. Yin Jieran and others from the Jinan Sales Department of the Shandong Electrical Factory, originally under the East China Industrial Department's Shandong Office, also colluded to sell and divide among themselves telecommunications equipment worth more than 3 million yuan that was not recorded in the accounts.

    The leading cadres of the office usually neglected leadership and, although they had discovered cases of graft and embezzlement by cadres, they always considered them "minor details of life, of no importance." After this study and inspection, they have realized that the corruption and degeneration of cadres not only harms national property but also creates a negative impact on the masses. The discovered cases of graft and embezzlement are currently being studied and dealt with.

    贪污舞弊不是“生活细节”
    华东工业部山东办事处展开反贪污学习与检查编辑同志：
    自人民日报七月十八日登载了济南工业局经营科正副科长陆原、樊刚等十一人集体贪污案后，华东工业部山东办事处即展开了反贪污的学习与检查。
    在学习中，检查出办事处供应科副科长姜汉忠等经常与奸商大吃大喝，并贪污受贿。据初步统计，他们已接受了奸商的日用品、收音机等贿物及现款三百余万元，并贪污了一百万元。姜汉忠于去年十一月间与奸商黑连恂勾结营私舞弊，一次吃喝即费去七十万元。原华东工业部山东办事处电器厂济南门市部殷杰然等，也曾将价值三百余万元未入账的电讯器材伙卖分用。
    该处领导干部平时放弃领导，虽曾发现干部贪污舞弊事件，但总认为是“生活小节，无关紧要”。经过此次学习与检查，他们已认识到干部的腐化堕落不但使国家资财受到损害，且会在群众中造成不良影响。已检查出来的贪污舞弊事件，目前正研究处理中。
