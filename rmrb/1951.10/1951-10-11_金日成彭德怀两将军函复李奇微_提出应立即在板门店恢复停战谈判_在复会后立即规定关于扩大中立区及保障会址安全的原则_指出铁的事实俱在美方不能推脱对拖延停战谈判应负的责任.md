Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 10th: General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, sent a letter on October 9th replying to Ridgway's letter of October 8th. The full text is as follows:

To General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces:

We received your letter of October 8th on October 9th.

In this letter, you once again attempt to place the responsibility for delaying the armistice negotiations on our side. We believe that your statement is completely invalid. The responsibility for delaying the negotiations lies entirely with your side. We have stated the facts and reasons very clearly in our previous letters to you, and you cannot deny them. This letter of yours also fails to provide any new reasons, showing that your arbitrary statement cannot overturn the ironclad facts, and therefore, cannot evade all the responsibilities that your side should bear.

In view of the fact that your side has only used the agreement on the neutralization of the meeting area to restrain our side in the past, while your side can arbitrarily destroy and deny responsibility by claiming no responsibility for the area, we propose to expand the neutral zone of the armistice conference area into a long area including both Kaesong and Munsan, for which both sides are responsible, and to move the meeting site to Panmunjom, where both sides are equally responsible for protecting the security of this meeting site. Since your letter has agreed to the Panmunjom area as the meeting site and expressed willingness to implement equal responsibility for control by both sides, the issue of expanding the neutral zone between Kaesong and Munsan can be left to the conference of the two delegations to resolve. Therefore, the two delegations should immediately resume armistice negotiations at Panmunjom, and as we proposed in our previous letter, stipulate principles on expanding the scope of the neutral zone and ensuring the security of the meeting site at the first meeting after the resumption, and establish an appropriate mechanism to resolve various specific issues related to this.

We have ordered our liaison officer to meet with your liaison officer at 10:00 a.m. on October 10th to discuss the resumption of the meetings of the two delegations.

Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers
October 9th, 1951

The following is Ridgway's letter of October 8th:

To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Commander Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

I have received your letter of October 7, 1951. I urge you to refer to my previous letters and reiterate that the responsibility for the delay in negotiations over the past few weeks lies with your side. In my letters to you on September 27 and October 4, I proposed the fundamental conditions that must exist to ensure equality in the control of the meeting site, and equality in the movement in and out of the meeting site and in actions within the meeting site. This condition I repeat, is that the meeting site should be located approximately midway between the front lines of both sides. Only in this way can both sides be expected to fulfill their respective responsibilities for the safety of the passageway to the meeting site and the safety of the meeting site itself. Regarding your proposal to expand the neutral zone, my opinion is that it is sufficient now to delineate a small neutral zone around the new meeting site, while stipulating that Kaesong, Munsan, and the road from Kaesong and Munsan to Panmunjom should not be attacked. I believe that an address near Panmunjom can meet the fundamental conditions of equality of action and control, and believe that you share my opinion on its neutralization. I have ordered my liaison officer to meet with your liaison officer at 10:00 a.m. on October 10th to discuss the resumption of negotiations between the two delegations.

Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, General of the Army, United States Army
October 8th, 1951

    金日成彭德怀两将军函复李奇微
    提出应立即在板门店恢复停战谈判
    在复会后立即规定关于扩大中立区及保障会址安全的原则
    指出铁的事实俱在美方不能推脱对拖延停战谈判应负的责任
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，于十月九日致函答复李奇微十月八日的来信，全文如下：联合国军李奇微总司令：
    我们在十月九日收到了你十月八日的来信。
    你这次来信再度企图将停战谈判拖延的责任加于我方，我们认为你的这种声明是完全无效的。因为拖延谈判的责任之完全属于你方，我们在历次给你的信中已经将事实和理由讲得很清楚了，你方亦无从加以否认，而你这次来信也提不出任何新的理由，可见你方武断的声明决推翻不了铁的事实，从而也决不可能推脱你方所应负的一切责任。
    鉴于你方过去只用会议地区中立化的协议来约束我方，而你方则可以藉口对该地区没有责任而肆意破坏和抵赖，故我们乃建议将停战会议地区的中立范围扩大成为连开城和汶山都包含在内的双方都负有责任的一个长形地区，并将会场地址移至板门店，由双方平等负责，来保护这一会场地址的安全。你的来信既已同意板门店地区作为会场地址，并表示愿意实行双方平等负责的管制，那么，开城汶山间中立区范围的扩大问题，可以留到双方代表团的会议上去解决。因此，双方代表团应立即在板门店恢复停战谈判，并如我们前信所提，在复会后的第一次会议上规定关于扩大中立区范围及保障会场地址安全的原则，并成立一个适当机构去解决与此有关的各项具体问题。
    我们已命令我方联络官于十月十日上午十时与你方联络官会晤，以商定双方代表团复会的事宜。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官  金日成
   中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
    一九五一年十月九日
    按李奇微十月八日的来信如下：朝鲜人民军金日成最高司令官中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员：
    你们一九五一年十月七日的来信收到了。我提请你们参照我以前的信件，并再次声明过去数星期来谈判拖延的责任是在你方。我在九月二十七日和十月四日给你们的信中，曾提出为保证对会议地址的管制的平等，及出入会议地址与在会议地址内行动的平等，而必须存在的基本条件，这一条件我重复一遍，就是会议地址应位于约当双方前线之间的中途。只有这样，才能期望双方各对会议地址的通道之安全与会议地址本身之安全，尽其应负的一份责任。关于你们所提扩大中立区的提议，我的意见是现在只要划定新会议地址周围的一个小中立区，同时规定开城、汶山及由开城和汶山通往板门店的公路不受攻击，就已够了。相信板门店左近的一个地址，可符合行动与管制平等的基本条件，并相信你们对它的中立化问题，与我持同样意见。我命令我的联络官在十月十日上午十时与你方联络官会晤，以讨论双方代表团恢复谈判的事宜。
    联合国军总司令美国陆军上将  李奇微
   一九五一年十月八日
