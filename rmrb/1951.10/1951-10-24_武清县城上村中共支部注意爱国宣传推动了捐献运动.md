    Wuqing County Chengshang Village CCP Branch Pays Attention to Patriotic Propaganda and Promotes Donation Movement
    To the Editor:
    The Chengshang Village CCP Branch in the Eighth District of Wuqing County, Hebei Province, after seeing the three major appeals of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association in the newspaper, led the village's 21 propagandists and the village's non-Party propaganda team to thoroughly explain the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army in Korea and the significance of donating planes and artillery to the masses. Because the propaganda work was well done, it greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. Each household formulated plans to increase production and donations, and launched a production competition. Men, women, old and young all worked from dawn till dusk. This year, the village's land was generally hoed one or two more times, and diseases and pests were treated in time, which protected the crops. As a result, the village's land generally increased production by 10%, and additional income was generated from sideline production.
    On August 16th, after hearing the report of the comrades of the delegation to Korea, the masses' donation was even more enthusiastic, and many people increased the amount of their donations. From September 3rd to 10th, in eight days, the village's 314 households donated a total of 10,081,500 yuan, completing the donation plan ahead of schedule.

    武清县城上村中共支部注意爱国宣传推动了捐献运动编辑同志：
    河北武清县第八区城上村中共支部，自从在报上看到抗美援朝总会三大号召后，就领导全村二十一名宣传员及村中非党宣传队伍，深入地把志愿军在朝鲜的英勇事迹和捐献飞机大炮的意义反复讲解给群众听。因为宣传工作做得好，所以大大启发了群众的爱国热情，各户纷纷订出了增产捐献计划，展开了生产竞赛，男女老幼都起早搭黑地耕作。今年全村土地普遍作到了多锄一遍到二遍，并及时除治病虫害，保住了庄稼。因此全村土地普遍增产一成，另外并从副业生产中增加了一部收入。
    八月十六日，村中听了赴朝慰问团同志回国后的报告，群众捐献更热烈了，许多人都增加了捐献数字。从九月三日起到十日，八天中全村共三百十四户人家捐献出了一千零八十一万五千元，提前完成了捐献计划。
