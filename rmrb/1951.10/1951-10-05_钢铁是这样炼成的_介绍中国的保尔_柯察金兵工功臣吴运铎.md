Wu Yunduo, Deputy Director of the Ordnance Bureau of the Central South Industrial Department, was honorably invited to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration. He is a people's hero with outstanding contributions in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. In the past dozen years of ordnance production, he was wounded over a hundred times, and his hands and feet were disabled, but he still insisted on fighting bravely for the revolutionary cause, and was therefore called China's Paul Korchagin.

Wu Yunduo was born in the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi, and later worked as an electrician in the Yuanhua Coal Mine in Daye, Hubei. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he joined the New Fourth Army and engaged in ordnance production. In 1939, he joined the Communist Party of China.

After 1941, the Japanese invaders launched large-scale attacks on our anti-Japanese base areas. He and other workers transferred from the southern Anhui Anti-Japanese Base Area to the Huainan Anti-Japanese Base Area. At that time, the troops were extremely short of weapons and ammunition. Each soldier only had three bullets, and they had to pick up the cartridge cases after firing them. In such difficult circumstances, Wu Yunduo accepted the task of creating guns and ammunition. At that time, he led only eight workers and apprentices, and the tools were a four-foot lathe, two pairs of pliers, a rocking drill, and some other scattered tools. The work was very difficult. However, Wu Yunduo drew and designed during the day, and worked hard with the workers at night, and finally, in about a year, renovated enough machines and tools. They manufactured a lot of guns and ammunition to supply the front-line troops. During the fierce attacks of the Japanese invaders, he led the workers to carry the machines and fight guerrilla warfare, still insisting on working and completing each task on time. Once, a batch of old artillery shells was sent from the front, urgently needing to be repaired for combat needs, but there was a lack of mercury fulminate, and work could not be done. He tried to collect some detonators from discarded artillery shells, wanting to extract mercury fulminate from them. While he was digging mercury fulminate from the water-soaked detonators, he unfortunately caused an explosion. He was seriously injured, four fingers on his left hand were blown off, his left knee was injured, and the crystalline lens of his left eye was also broken by fragments. But when he heard in the hospital that the front line was very short of ammunition, he couldn't wait for his injury to heal and returned to his factory, limping.

Wu Yunduo actively led the workers in the factory to research and improve weapons and equipment, so that the front-line troops could get more new weapons to strike the enemy. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he successively produced rifle grenades with a range of 540 meters and flat-trajectory guns for attacking bunkers. These weapons played a great role in combat.

In 1947, Wu Yunduo was ordered to establish a shell factory and a fuze factory in a certain place, and served as the director. During an experiment to test the explosive force of ammunition, he was unfortunately injured all over again, his left wrist was also blown off, and his right foot was blown off. When he regained consciousness, he saw that he was disabled, and thought that he could no longer pick up a hammer and file to continue working for the Party, and he was heartbroken and wanted to cry. The responsible comrades of the Party constantly went to comfort and encourage him, making him understand that a Bolshevik could overcome the difficulties of physical disability and continue to work for the Party. He also opened the Soviet novel "How Steel Was Tempered." The heroic behavior of Paul Korchagin encouraged him. He repeatedly recited these words in the book: "I only ask to leave me with something that can sustain life, a heart and a lung, and I will continue to fight tenaciously." Two months later, as soon as he could sit up, he leaned on a wooden board and engaged in writing about fuze manufacturing, and he also learned Japanese. Seven months later, he was able to get out of bed. He said: "If I can move, I can work!" So, he asked his superiors to buy a set of chemical instruments and turned the ward into a laboratory, concentrating on ordnance research and creating an advanced explosive. In August 1949, he returned to the factory, leaning on crutches. In the winter of the same year, the Liberation War achieved a nationwide victory, and he was sent to the Soviet Union to treat his eyes, which still contained shrapnel.

In Moscow, the wife of Ostrovsky, the author of "How Steel Was Tempered?", heard about his heroic deeds and visited him in the hospital. Soviet friends expressed infinite love and respect for this "Chinese Paul." Under the careful treatment of Soviet doctors, Wu Yunduo's left eye finally regained its sight in 1950.

Now, he is buried in the laboratory conducting research work. He often says that when he thinks that a disabled person can still contribute to defending the motherland and world peace, he feels infinitely happy in his heart. (Xinhua News Agency) (With picture)

    钢铁是这样炼成的
    ——介绍中国的保尔·柯察金兵工功臣吴运铎
    中南工业部兵工局副局长吴运铎，光荣地被邀请到北京来参加国庆大典了。他是一位在抗日战争和解放战争中功勋卓著的人民功臣。他在过去十几年的兵工生产中，曾负伤一百余处，手足残废，但仍坚持为革命事业英勇奋斗，因而被称为中国的保尔·柯察金。
    吴运铎出生在江西老根据地，后来在湖北大冶源华煤矿当电机工人。抗日战争爆发后参加新四军，作兵工生产工作。一九三九年，他参加了中国共产党。
    一九四一年以后，日寇大举向我抗日根据地进攻。他和其他工人一起自皖南抗日根据地转移到了淮南抗日根据地。当时，部队的武器弹药非常缺乏，战士们每人只有三粒子弹，打完了还要把弹壳捡回来。在这样艰苦的环境下，吴运铎接受了创造枪炮和弹药的任务。那时他领导的只有八个工人和学徒，工具是一部四尺车床、两把老虎钳、一部摇钻和其他一些零星工具。工作非常困难。但是，吴运铎白天绘图设计，夜晚与工人一起努力工作，终于在一年左右翻造出足够的机器和工具。他们制造出很多枪炮弹药供给了前方部队。在日寇猛烈进攻的时候，他带领工人们抬着机器打游击，仍然坚持工作，按时完成了历次任务。有一次，前方送来一批旧炮弹，急待修好了以供战斗需要，但是缺乏雷汞，无法工作。他就设法收集了一些废炮弹的雷管，想从这里面取出雷汞来。当他正从水浸过的雷管中挖取雷汞的时候，不幸引起了爆炸。他负了重伤，左手四个指头被炸掉，左腿膝盖被炸伤，左眼的水晶体也被碎片炸破了。但是当他在医院里听说前方非常缺乏弹药的时候，他就等不及伤痊愈，一颠一跛地回到了自己的工厂。
    吴运铎积极带领全厂工人研究改善武器装备，使前方部队得到更多的新的武器打击敌人。在抗日战争期间，他先后制成了射程达五百四十米的枪榴弹和攻打碉堡的平射炮，这些武器在战斗中发挥了很大威力。
    一九四七年，吴运铎奉命去某地建立炮弹厂和引信厂，并担任厂长。在一次实验弹药爆炸力的时候，他不幸又被炸得浑身负伤，左腕也被炸断，而且炸掉了右脚。当他精神稍微清醒过来的时候，他看看自己已成残废，想到从此再也不能拿起铁锤和锉刀继续为党工作了，他伤心得要哭起来。党的负责同志不断去慰问和鼓励他，使他明白一个布尔什维克是能够克服身体残废的困难、继续为党工作的。他又翻开了苏联小说“钢铁是怎样炼成的”。保尔·柯察金的英雄行为鼓舞了他。他反覆地念着书上的这几句话：“我只要求给我留下一点能够维持生命的东西，一颗心脏和一叶肺，我还要顽强地斗争下去。”两个月以后，他身体刚可以坐起来，就又撑在木板上，从事关于引信制造的著作，他并学会了日文。七个月后，他才能够下床。他说：“能动就能工作！”于是，他又请求上级买了一套化学仪器，把病房变成实验室，专心致力于兵工研究，创造了一种高级炸药。一九四九年八月，他扶着双拐回到厂里。同年冬季，解放战争取得了全国性的胜利，他被送到苏联去诊治他里面还有着弹片的眼睛。
    在莫斯科，“钢铁是怎样炼成的？”作者奥斯托洛夫斯基的夫人听到了关于他的英雄事迹，到医院里看望他。苏联朋友对这位“中国的保尔”表示了无限的热爱和崇敬。在苏联医生的悉心治疗下，吴运铎的左眼终于在一九五零年恢复了光明。
    现在，他埋头在实验室里进行着研究工作。他时常说，当他想到一个残废的人还能为保卫祖国和世界和平贡献出一分力量的时候，心里就感到无限的愉快。          （新华社）（附图片）
