Xinhua News Agency, 12th: A delayed dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Peace Committee issued a statement on September 15th, denouncing the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and calling on the Japanese people to launch a movement against the Japanese Diet's ratification of these two war treaties. The statement first pointed out: The separate peace treaty and the "Security Treaty" are not treaties to guarantee Japan's security, but treaties that cause terrible misfortune to the Japanese people. Their signing puts Japan on the brink of war. The statement said: The separate peace treaty nominally grants Japan independent sovereignty, but the "Security Treaty" cancels it. The "Security Treaty" openly gives the United States the right to interfere in Japan's internal affairs and entrusts all provisions relating to the stationing of US troops in Japan to the "Administrative Agreement." In short, the Japanese Diet shall not interfere in anything. Japan's position is exactly the same as that of "Manchukuo," which was previously granted "independence."

The statement further stated: These two treaties isolate Japan in Asia and make Japan, which has lost its independence, completely lose the foundation for economic self-reliance. Not only that, but the endless expansion of military spending will worsen Japan's inflation, increase taxes, and make wage cuts and intensified labor inevitable. The lives of the Japanese people will move towards the abyss of poverty. All this proves that Yoshida signed these two treaties not for the benefit of the Japanese people.

The Japanese Peace Committee appealed to all patriotic Japanese people: (1) All patriotic Japanese people should unite to smash the conspiracy to ratify these two treaties; (2) Demand the convening of a conference with the participation of all countries that fought against Japan to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan; (3) Resolutely oppose all military agreements and rearmament.

The statement finally called on the Japanese people to launch a more vigorous movement to demand the conclusion of a peace pact by the five great powers to stop war.

At the same time, the Japanese Peace Committee also launched a "Peace Month Against the Ratification of the Separate Peace Treaty." The "Peace Month" will run from September 20th to the closing of the Diet session scheduled for October 10th to discuss the separate peace treaty. During this period, the following work will be carried out: add a clause "Oppose the ratification of the separate peace treaty" to the declaration demanding comprehensive peace and opposing rearmament, and actively collect signatures for this declaration; various groups, workplaces, schools, residences, etc. hold meetings on opposing the ratification of the separate peace treaty and rearmament, and send the meeting resolutions to the Diet, members of parliament, the government, etc.; people in various constituencies urge the members of parliament elected from their respective constituencies to oppose the ratification of the separate peace treaty in the Diet; strengthen the collection of signatures for the peace pact declaration.

    不准国会批准单独和约与美日军事协定
    日本和委会号召人民团结斗争
    要求五大国缔结和平公约制止战争
    【新华社十二日讯】东京迟到消息：日本拥护和平委员会曾在九月十五日发表声明，痛斥单独对日和约和美日《安全条约》，并号召日本人民展开反对日本国会批准这两个战争条约的运动。声明首先指出：单独和约和《安全条约》并不是保障日本安全的条约，而是对日本人民造成可怕的不幸的条约。它们的签订，使日本面临战争的深渊。声明说：单独和约在名义上赋予日本独立主权，但《安全条约》又把它取消了。《安全条约》公开给美国以干涉日本内政的权利，并且把有关美国驻军日本的一切规定都委诸《行政协定》。总而言之，日本国会对一切都不得干预。日本的地位完全和以前被给予“独立”的“满洲国”的地位一样。
    声明进一步说：这两个条约使日本在亚洲孤立，而且使丧失独立的日本在经济上完全失去了自立的基础。不仅如此，没有止境的军费膨胀，将使日本的通货膨胀日益恶化，捐税日益加重，压低工资和加强劳动也将成为不可避免之事。日本人民的生活将走向穷困的深渊。这一切都证明吉田签署这两个条约并不是为了日本人民的利益。
    日本拥护和平委员会向全体爱国的日本人民呼吁：（一）全体爱国的日本人民团结起来，粉碎批准这两个条约的阴谋；（二）要求召开有全体对日作战国家参加的会议，缔结全面对日和约；（三）坚决反对一切军事协定和重新武装。
    声明最后号召日本人民展开更强有力的运动，要求缔结五大国和平公约，制止战争。
    与此同时，日本拥护和平委员会并发起举行“反对批准单独和约和平月”。“和平月”的期间从九月二十日开始，到订于十月十日召开的讨论单独和约的国会会议闭幕时为止。在这个期间，将进行下列工作：在要求全面媾和、反对重新武装的宣言上，增加一条“反对批准单独和约”，并积极为这个宣言征集签名；各团体、工作场所、学校、住宅等举行关于反对批准单独和约和重新武装的会议，并将会议决议送交国会、议员、政府等；各选区人民促使由各该选区选出的议员在国会中反对批准单独和约；加强征集和平公约宣言的签名。
