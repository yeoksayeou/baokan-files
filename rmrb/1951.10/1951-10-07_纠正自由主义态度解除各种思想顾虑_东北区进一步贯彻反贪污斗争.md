    Correct Liberal Attitudes, Remove Ideological Concerns:
    Northeast Region Further Implements Anti-Corruption Struggle
    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Northeast region is gradually unfolding. Most agencies at the Northeast level and the Party committees of each province and city have, based on the spirit of Comrade Gao Gang's report and according to the conditions of their own units, formulated specific plans to earnestly promote this work, and many cadres have actively joined the movement. However, some cadres still have many incorrect understandings and attitudes towards this movement. Some cadres in the Personnel Department, Labor Bureau, and First Hospital affiliated with the Health Department of Songjiang Province believe that "anti-corruption is a matter for the financial and economic departments." Some cadres in the directly affiliated agencies of Liaodong Province even mistakenly said, "Corruption is not a political problem, but a lifestyle problem." Therefore, they adopted a liberal attitude of indifference and non-involvement towards the movement. Some cadres in certain departments of Dalian City felt that they had no corruption, and from the beginning, they were weary of the anti-corruption campaign, saying it was a "waste of time." In Songjiang Province, some people in the Health Department even refused to attend relevant meetings. Still, other cadres had insufficient understanding of the movement, and there were many concerns in their minds. Some doubted that this movement was just a passing fad and could not fundamentally solve the problem; some cadres were afraid of being retaliated against after giving opinions to leaders; some were unwilling to be activists, saying "whoever is active is unlucky." Therefore, they dared not inspect or expose some corrupt phenomena. Those who had committed corruption errors had even greater concerns. If they confessed, they were afraid of compensating for stolen goods, losing their jobs, and being sent to court; if they didn't confess, they were afraid of being reported, showing anxiety and unease. Those with concerns in their minds often dared not touch on specific ideological problems in the movement, or they skirted the main points, or simply quibbled over words and terminology, making empty remarks. Some agencies in Dalian City spent a long time discussing "What comes first, corruption or degeneration?" "Does accepting a cigarette from someone else count as corruption?" Some units of the Northeast People's Government were still discussing the definition of corruption. In Anshan City, some groups spent half an hour arguing about "the difference between corruption and theft." This simply vulgarized the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.
    The reason for these problems is that, first of all, the leading cadres of some units do not understand or do not deeply understand the important significance of Comrade Gao Gang's report, regarding the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy as something optional, and therefore did not earnestly and responsibly lead this movement. The Native Produce Company under the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government is such an example. The manager of the Songjiang Provincial Grain Company, under the pretext of "holding professional meetings, being too busy with work," did not participate in the anti-corruption struggle. Leading cadres in some units in Dalian City only made reports to cadres and did not participate in a single study session. Secondly, some leading cadres of some units believed that there were no major problems in their units, were blindly complacent, and only read Comrade Gao Gang's report once, without going through the specific situation of their own units to identify the main existing problems for research and analysis. When reviewing the work of their own units, leading cadres of some departments in Songjiang Province simply put a general label of bureaucracy on themselves and let it go, while some cadres did not make any review at all. The masses reacted that "the leadership is not sincere" and suspected that giving opinions to leaders would result in retaliation and suppression.
    The experience of various places shows that wherever leading cadres attach importance to it, personally lead it, fully promote democracy, do a good job in ideological education, deeply understand the situation, and promptly remove the ideological concerns of cadres, and correct deviations in the movement, the anti-corruption movement can be carried out smoothly. Conversely, if leading cadres adopt a passive attitude, lack self-criticism, or only raise issues in a general way without combining them with the specific situation of their own units, the movement will stagnate.
    In order to eliminate the above-mentioned ideological obstacles and further implement Comrade Gao Gang's call for anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a joint meeting of responsible persons of Northeast-level agencies on September 18. The meeting specifically pointed out that the movement in each unit must be led responsibly by the top leaders, concentrating efforts and persevering to the end. The CPC committees of Songjiang, Jilin, and other provinces have convened cadre meetings again for this purpose, pointing out that responsible cadres at all levels of Party committees should personally lead and fully promote democracy so that the anti-corruption struggle can form a mass democratic inspection movement.

### 纠正自由主义态度解除各种思想顾虑  东北区进一步贯彻反贪污斗争

    纠正自由主义态度解除各种思想顾虑
    东北区进一步贯彻反贪污斗争
    东北区的反贪污腐化、反官僚主义运动正逐步开展。东北一级大多数机关、各省、市党委均根据高岗同志的报告精神，按照本单位的情况，订出具体计划，认真推动这一工作，许多干部已积极投入运动。但还有些干部对这一运动有着许多不正确的认识和不正确的态度。松江省人民政府人事厅、劳动局及卫生厅所属第一医院的某些干部认为：“反贪污是财政经济部门的事。”辽东省直属机关有的干部更错误地说：“贪污不是政治问题，是生活问题。”因而，他们对运动采取了事不关己不闻不问的自由主义态度。旅大市某些部门的干部，认为自己没有贪污，一开始对反贪污就有厌倦情绪，说这是“白浪费时间”。松江省卫生厅甚至有人不参加有关的会议。另有一些干部因对运动认识不足，思想上存在着许多顾虑。有的怀疑这次运动是一阵风，不能彻底解决问题；有的干部怕给领导人提了意见后受到报复；有的不愿做积极分子，说“谁积极谁倒霉”。因此，对一些贪污腐化现象，不敢进行检查和揭发。犯有贪污错误的人，顾虑更大，坦白吧，怕倒赃，怕失业，怕送法院；不坦白吧，又怕别人检举，表现了惶惶不安。思想上存在着顾虑的人，在运动中往往不敢接触具体思想问题，或是避重就轻，或只是扣字眼、钻名词，发表空洞的议论。旅大市有的机关单位，曾化费了很长的时间讨论“先贪污呢，还是先腐化呢？”“吸别人一支烟算不算贪污？”东北人民政府有的单位还在讨论贪污的定义。鞍山市有的小组曾用半个小时的时间争论“贪污和偷盗的区别”。这简直把反贪污腐化反官僚主义的运动庸俗化了。
    产生这些问题的原因，首先是有些单位的领导干部，不了解或不深刻了解高岗同志报告的重要意义，把反贪污腐化、反官僚主义的斗争，看做可有可无的事情，因而没有认真负责地领导这一运动。东北人民政府贸易部所属的土产公司即是如此。松江省粮食公司经理，借口“搞专业会议，工作太忙”，不参加反贪污斗争。旅大市有的单位的领导干部，只向干部作过报告，没有参加过一次学习。其次有的单位的领导干部，认为自己单位没有大问题，盲目自满，只把高岗同志的报告念了一遍，而不去通过本单位的具体情况，找出目前存在的主要问题，进行研究分析。松江省有的部门的领导干部，在检讨本单位的工作时，也只是笼统地给自己扣个官僚主义的帽子就过去了，有些干部则根本不作检讨。群众反应“领导上无诚意”，并怀疑给领导人提了意见会遭到报复和打击。
    各地的经验说明，凡是领导干部重视，亲自领导，充分发扬民主，做好思想教育，深入了解情况，及时解除干部思想顾虑，纠正运动中的偏差，反贪污运动就能顺利地开展。相反地，领导干部采取消极态度，缺乏自我批评，或只泛泛地提出问题，而不结合本单位的具体情况，运动就陷于停滞。
    中共中央东北局为了扫除上述思想障碍，进一步贯彻高岗同志关于反贪污腐化、反官僚主义的号召，于九月十八日召开了东北一级机关负责人联席会议。会议特别指出，各单位的运动一定要由首长负责，认真领导，集中力量，坚持到底。中共松江、吉林等省委，为此曾再次召开了干部会议，指出各级党委负责干部，亲自领导，充分发扬民主，使反贪污腐化的斗争，形成群众性的民主检查运动。
