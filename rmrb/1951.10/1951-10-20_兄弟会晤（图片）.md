    Brotherly Meeting
    (Collaboration between Ma Keming and Qin Zheng)
    (10) Before leaving, the peasant representatives said, "We guarantee to increase cotton production to meet the needs of the factories, and we will make sure the cotton is clean. We hope our worker brothers will supply us with more cloth." Zhou Guixiang and others also repeatedly expressed their determination to save raw materials, spin more yarn, and weave more cloth to ensure that the people and the military across the country have clothes to wear.
    (11) On the way back from the factory, the peasant representatives discussed in the car: In the past, they often wondered, both workers and peasants produce, what makes workers better than peasants? Today, they realized that the work of dozens of peasants is not as much as that of one worker. To improve agricultural production, we must rely on the help of our worker brothers.

    （十一）在参观完了离开工厂的路上，农民代表们在汽车里纷纷议论着：过去心里常盘算，工人生产，农民也生产，工人那一点比农民强？今天才明白几十个农民干的活也顶不上一个工人干的多，农业生产要搞得更好，必须靠工人老大哥们的帮助。
