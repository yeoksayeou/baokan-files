A brief Comment on Cultural Life

    The decisive factor in successfully conducting on-the-job learning for cadres in government organs lies in the attention, supervision, and inspection by the leading cadres of those organs. The experience of the Ministry of Agriculture has fully proven this point. The Ministry's Learning Committee is composed of two Vice Ministers and the Director of the Personnel Department as the Director and Deputy Director, respectively. It also includes active learners, who are responsible for leading political, professional, and cultural learning. Minister Li Shucheng not only personally participated in the leadership but also personally inspected the learning of division-level cadres, instructing the Education Section to report on the learning progress of each division director individually. Minister Li also personally presided over the awarding of prizes when rewarding learning models. Therefore, since late March of this year, the Ministry's learning has never been interrupted. The Learning Committee was able to proactively arrange learning and, based on the principle of self-reliance, cultivated its own theoretical teachers who are currently competent. Especially during the period from March to mid-June, due to the close attention of leading cadres and the proper allocation of time, learning was closely integrated with the three major movements of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, comrades not only showed great enthusiasm in the three major movements, but their learning performance was also relatively good. For example, based on the results of the test scoring of Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of Political Economy, there were 141 with excellent grades, 82 with good grades, and 6 with passing grades. After June, the Ministry systematically conducted learning on cadre review, united front work, and confidentiality; before National Day, it focused on learning about current events. Now, according to the learning plan stipulated by the Central Personnel Department, it will study "Several Major Issues of Mao Zedong Thought," which is expected to be completed in two months. The Learning Committee has also formulated a specific plan for this study.
    From the above situation, it seems that the importance attached by the leaders and the sound leadership of the Learning Committee are very important for doing a good job in the learning of cadres in the organs. However, there are still some leaders of organs who do not care or do not care much about the learning of the organs, and push the learning of the organs to others to manage. This phenomenon should be improved.

### 机关首长应重视在职干部学习

    机关首长应重视在职干部学习
    搞好机关在职干部学习的决定环节，是机关首长的重视和督促检查。中央农业部的经验已完全证明了这一点。该部学委会由两位副部长及人事处处长分任正副主任；并吸收学习积极分子参加，分工领导政治、业务、文化三种学习。李书城部长，不但亲自参加领导，还亲自检查司长一级的学习，责成教育科逐个汇报司长的学习情况。在奖励学习模范时，李部长并亲自主持发奖。因此，从今年三月下旬迄今，该部的学习一直没有间断。学委会能够主动地布置学习，并在自力更生的原则下，培养了自己的在目前尚可胜任的理论教员。特别在三月到六月半这段时间内，由于领导干部抓得紧，时间支配得当，使学习紧密结合了抗美援朝、土地改革与镇压反革命三大运动。因此，同志们不但在三大运动中表现十分积极，学习成绩也是比较好的。如就政治经济学三、四、五章测验评卷的结果看：甲等就有一四一人，乙等八二人，丙等六人。六月份以后，该部系统地进行了关于审查干部、统一战线工作及保密的学习；国庆节前集中学习时事。现在将根据中央人事部规定的学习计划，进行“毛泽东思想的几个主要问题”的学习，预计在两个月内结束。学委会并已制定此项学习的具体计划。
    从以上情况看来，首长重视和学委会的健全领导对搞好机关干部学习的作用是很大的；但是现在也还有些机关的首长，不关心或者不甚关心机关学习，把机关学习推给别人来管，这种现象应该加以改进。
