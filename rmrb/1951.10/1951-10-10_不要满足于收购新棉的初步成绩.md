    Do Not Be Satisfied with the Preliminary Achievements in the Procurement of New Cotton
    Strengthening the procurement of new cotton is one of the important tasks of financial and economic work in cotton-producing areas at present. Since the new cotton has been put on the market, various cotton-producing areas have begun procurement work; some areas, such as Taicang County in the Southern Jiangsu District, have even overfulfilled the initial task. This kind of procurement achievement is very good, and all regions should step up procurement work.
    However, we must never be satisfied with the existing achievements. It should be recognized that the procurement of "first bloom" cotton is relatively easy. The quality of "first bloom" cotton is lower; farmers have just harvested the new cotton and are in urgent need of money; therefore, farmers are more willing to sell the "first bloom" cotton quickly. Anyone who is overwhelmed by the initial victory in cotton procurement and becomes lax in thought will make mistakes.
    Without a doubt, we should sufficiently estimate the political consciousness of the peasants after the land reform, especially since the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign; but we must also sufficiently estimate the ideological concerns that still exist among cotton farmers, as well as the shortcomings that still exist in the cotton procurement work. Faced with this year's huge cotton procurement task, no one can be slack or complacent.
    The party and government leading organs in various cotton-producing areas should be very clearly aware of this issue, accept the experience and lessons of cotton procurement and storage in June, July, and August, and work with a hundred times more effort to do a good job in cotton procurement.

    不要满足于收购新棉的初步成绩
    加强收购新棉的工作，是当前产棉地区财经工作中的重要任务之一。自新花上市后，各产棉区已开始进行了收购工作；有些地区，像苏南区太仓县，并已超额完成了首期的任务。这种收购成绩是很好的，各地均应加紧收购工作。
    但是，我们绝不能满足已有的成绩。应该认识，收购“头喷花”是比较容易的。“头喷花”质量较低；农民刚刚收下新棉，急等钱用；因此，农民比较愿意迅速出卖“头喷花”。任何人如果被开始购棉的胜利冲昏头脑，而在思想上松懈起来，那就会犯错误。
    毫无疑问：我们应该足够地估计农民在土地改革以后，特别是抗美援朝以来的政治觉悟；但也要足够地估计棉农还存在着若干思想顾虑，以及购棉工作中还存在着若干缺点。面对着今年巨大的购棉任务，任何人都不能松懈和麻痹。
    各产棉区的党政领导机关，应该十分清醒地认识这个问题，接受六、七、八月间购棉储棉的经验教训，百倍紧张起来，把购棉工作作好。
