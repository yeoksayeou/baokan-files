Stabilize and Develop Elementary Education, Train a Million People's Teachers

With the gradual completion of the land reform and the gradual recovery of industrial and agricultural production throughout the country, the people of the whole country, especially the children of workers and peasants, are eagerly demanding to go to school. Elementary education is the basic education for the people of New China. It undertakes the important task of cultivating the next generation of New China and is related to the long-term interests of the country. Therefore, implementing universal elementary education in a planned, step-by-step, and prepared manner throughout the country to meet the demands of the working people has become an extremely important task for our country in the next few years.

To gradually popularize elementary education, a large number of teachers are needed. Adult elementary supplementary education also requires a large number of teachers. Who will train and supply this large number of teachers for elementary schools and schools for workers and peasants? It depends on secondary normal schools. The country's construction undertakings require a large number of intermediate-level construction talents, and various colleges and universities need a large number of students. Who will train and supply these? It depends on secondary schools of various levels and types. And the teachers of secondary normal schools and secondary schools of various levels and types mainly rely on higher normal schools to train. Therefore, normal education is like heavy industry in industry, the mother machine in machines. It is the foundation of the country's educational construction and the central link of all educational work.

This time, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government timely convened the First National Elementary Education and Normal Education Conference. Starting from the specific situation of our country's preparation for construction and taking into account the long-term needs of the country, it clearly stipulated the principles and tasks of elementary education and normal education. It determined that national elementary education should adopt the policy of stabilization, consolidation, and planned and step-by-step development; national normal education should adopt the policy of stabilization, consolidation, adjustment, and development. In addition, detailed discussions were held on issues such as elementary education funding, elementary school teacher compensation, implementation steps for elementary school system reform, in-service learning for primary and secondary school teachers, the policy of adjusting and setting up normal schools at all levels, and methods for training a large number of teachers in a short period of time, and decisions were made. All sectors of the country should attach importance to the issues raised at this conference and assist the education departments in implementing the policies decided by this conference and executing the decisions made by this conference, and strive to enroll 80% of school-age children nationwide by 1957 and train a million people's teachers.

Now, we want to focus on the following points:

First, the issue of stabilizing and developing elementary education. There are now more than 450,000 elementary schools across the country, with more than 37 million elementary school students. However, more than half of the school-age children nationwide have not yet enrolled. The national land reform is about to be completed, and the children of peasants are entering and will enter schools in large numbers, as are the children of workers in the cities. The capacity of elementary schools is far from sufficient to meet this need. This is one aspect. On the other hand, because the country's financial and economic situation has not fundamentally improved, coupled with the insufficient attention paid to elementary education by some local leading organs, rural education funding in some areas (especially newly liberated areas) is still very difficult, and the compensation for elementary school teachers (especially rural elementary school teachers) is still very low, which affects the stability and development of elementary education. Therefore, the current policy of elementary education should first stabilize existing schools and develop them in a planned and step-by-step manner on the basis of stability and consolidation. Elementary education funding must be appropriately resolved, and the compensation for elementary school teachers must be appropriately improved. This conference made specific decisions on both of these items and emphasized that elementary education funding should implement the policy of combining overall planning by local governments with reliance on the masses to run schools; the wages of rural elementary school teachers should be appropriately increased, and the political treatment and social status of elementary school teachers should be reasonably improved and guaranteed. The people of the whole country should respect the people's teachers; at the same time, elementary school teachers themselves must strive to improve their political and professional level, improve their relationship with the masses, and truly serve the people wholeheartedly. These are all correct. We hope that people's governments at all levels and all elementary school teachers will resolutely implement this policy, strive for the stability of elementary education nationwide, and then gradually improve the quality of elementary schools on the original basis and gradually seek their development, striving to enroll 80% of school-age children nationwide in the next five years.

Secondly, the most serious problem in future education work is the shortage of teachers in schools at all levels. It is estimated that by 1957, the country will lack approximately one million elementary school teachers, approximately 200,000 full-time teachers for spare-time schools for workers and peasants, approximately 130,000 teachers for secondary schools, more than 10,000 teachers for colleges and universities, and at least tens of thousands of teachers for kindergartens. Where do these million-plus teachers come from? First of all, they must be trained from normal schools at all levels. However, the foundation of existing normal education is very weak. There are now only 29 higher normal schools nationwide, of which only 17 are independently established, with only 11,500 students. In addition, there are 32 education departments attached to university liberal arts colleges, with more than 1,500 students. There are a total of 603 secondary normal schools, with more than 167,000 students. Such a quantity is far from sufficient to meet the teacher requirements of the current scale of secondary and elementary schools, and of course, it cannot cope with the needs of development. At the same time, at present, except for a few normal schools at all levels that have better results, the general local policies and tasks are not clear, the curriculum and teaching materials have not been reformed, and the equipment is poor. Therefore, the talents they train are still temporarily difficult to be competent as a qualified people's teacher. This conference made various specific regulations on how to adjust, rectify, and consolidate normal schools at all levels. These are all necessary and correct. Once these regulations are officially announced, we should strive to implement them. At the same time, we should formulate plans for the adjustment and development of normal schools at all levels according to needs and possibilities, and gradually implement them, so as to use formal methods to train a part of the people's teachers who are fully qualified.

In order to solve the urgent need for a large number of teachers in elementary education and secondary education, in addition to rectifying and developing formal normal education, we should also focus on adopting various short-term training methods to quickly and effectively train a large number of teachers. Formal training and short-term training are both indispensable; and in the next few years, the latter should be the focus. Unilaterally emphasizing formal normal education and only relying on formal methods to train teachers cannot keep up with objective needs; at the same time, unilaterally emphasizing short-term training and neglecting formal normal education will make teacher training lack standards, which is also incorrect.

To make the above policies and decisions a reality, we must have the correct work spirit and work methods. All education workers should deeply realize that the environment we are currently in is still a war environment, and all our work should start from the reality of the war. There are indeed many difficulties in front of us, but we have methods and hope. What methods should we use to carry out our work? Not conservative and outdated methods, but we should carry forward the revolutionary spirit and use revolutionary methods to overcome difficulties and solve problems. For example, developing elementary schools and training teachers are both difficult, but experience has proven that in the past long revolutionary war, weren't we able to run many schools and train a large number of outstanding talents? In the current war situation, the country's finances are still difficult. When we run schools, we should strive to save money, and the standards for construction and equipment should be lowered. We should temporarily not build high-rise buildings, and generally build bungalows. We should advocate using one penny as two pennies and one person as two people. At the same time, we should effectively rely on the masses and give full play to the strength of all parties to run education. By doing so, our difficulties can be overcome. For example, to solve the problem of teachers for elementary schools and elementary education for workers and peasants. We should continue to promote the method of mass teachers and "little teachers" who teach each other, as well as the method of schools implementing a two-part system. For example, to reform the curriculum and improve teaching methods, we should also use the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to first help teachers study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, carry out self-criticism and criticism, and firmly implement this reform through teaching research organizations. In short, future education work must abandon conservative attitudes and objectivism, and must proceed from the war environment, act in accordance with the laws of development of things, have vision, have a future, seek truth from facts, and have a revolutionary attitude and revolutionary methods that do not succumb to any difficulties. In this way, the people's education cause can overcome difficulties and advance victoriously.

Finally, we must also mention the phenomenon that some teachers in the current elementary education are not at ease in teaching. This phenomenon is local and temporary at present, but we should attach importance to this phenomenon and quickly change it. The people's teachers of New China are an extremely glorious title. They undertake the noble task of educating the new generation, are powerful assistants to the people's government in contacting the masses, and are propagandists of government policies. The psychology and behavior of belittling elementary school teachers left over from the old society must be vigorously corrected. People's governments at all levels should fully care about the lives and studies of elementary school teachers, and implement rewards for outstanding teachers to help them progress. In the past two years, the majority of elementary school teachers across the country have endured hardships and served the people with a high degree of patriotism, so elementary education nationwide can quickly recover and quickly exceed the level of the Kuomintang rule era. Especially the teachers in the disaster areas, they persisted in education work and other mass work under extremely difficult conditions and created many moving examples. These are all worthy of praise and encouragement from people's governments at all levels. But on the other hand, the teachers themselves should recognize that they still have many shortcomings, and many bad ideas and bad styles left over from the old society. They should resolutely correct these shortcomings so that they can gradually truly be worthy of the glorious title of people's teacher. Every people's teacher in New China should conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and strive to make himself a Marxist. Because teachers are the engineers of people's souls, only when our minds are armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can we shape the new generation of New China into active and conscious builders of today's New Democratic society and the future socialist and communist society.

    稳定和发展小学教育，培养百万人民教师
    随着全国土地改革的逐步完成和工农业生产的逐步恢复，全国人民，首先是工农的子女急迫要求上学。小学教育是新中国人民的基础教育。它担负着培养新中国后一代的重大任务，关系着国家的长远利益。因此，有计划、有步骤、有准备地在全国范围内实行普及小学教育，以满足劳动人民的要求，已经成为我国今后若干年内一项极其重要的任务。
    要逐渐普及小学教育，就需要大批的教师。成人的初等补习教育也需要大量的教师。这大量的小学和工农学校的师资靠谁来培养，谁来供给？靠中等师范学校。国家的建设事业需要大批的中级建设人才，各类高等学校需要大批的学生，这又靠谁来培养，谁来供给？靠各级各类的中等学校。而中级师范学校和各级各类的中等学校的师资，主要地又要依靠高等师范学校来培养。因此师范教育就好比工业中的重工业，机器中的工作母机。它是国家教育建设的根本，是全部教育工作的中心环节。
    这次中央人民政府教育部适时地召开了第一次全国初等教育和师范教育会议，从当前我国准备建设的具体情况出发，并且照顾到国家的长远需要，明确地规定了小学教育和师范教育的方针和任务，确定今后全国小学教育应该采取稳定、巩固并有计划、有步骤地发展的方针；全国师范教育应该采取稳定、巩固、调整和发展的方针。此外，对小学教育的经费、小学教师的待遇、小学学制改革的实施步骤、中小学教师的在职学习、各级师范学校的调整与设置的方针；大量短期培养师资的办法等问题，都进行了详尽的讨论，并且作出了决定。全国各方面都应该重视这一次会议所提出的问题，并协助教育部门贯彻这次会议所决定的方针，执行这次会议所作出的决定，为争取在一九五七年前全国百分之八十的学龄儿童入学，培养百万人民教师而奋斗。
    现在，我们要着重提出下面几点说一说：
    首先是关于安定和发展小学教育的问题。现在全国小学有四十五万余所，小学学生有三千七百多万人。但全国学龄儿童还有半数以上未入学。全国土地改革即将完成，农民子女正在和将要大批地涌入学校，在城市中工人的子女亦然，小学的容量还远远不足适应这种需要。这是一方面。另一方面，由于国家财政经济状况尚未根本好转，加以某些地方领导机关对小学教育重视不够，一部分地区（尤其是新解放区）农村教育经费还很困难，小学教师（尤其是农村小学教师）的待遇还很低，这就影响了小学教育的安定和发展。因此，目前小学教育的方针应该首先使现有的学校稳定下来，并在稳定与巩固的基础上作有计划、有步骤的发展。小学教育的经费必须作适当的解决，小学教师的待遇必须有适当的改善。这次会议对这两项都作了具体的决定，并且强调地指出小学教育经费应贯彻由地方政府统筹与依靠群众办学相结合的方针；农村小学教师的工资应该适当地提高，小学教师的政治待遇与社会地位应有合理的改善和保障，全国人民应该尊敬人民教师；同时，小学教师本身就必须努力提高自己的政治业务水平，改进自己与群众的关系，真正做到全心全意为人民服务。这些都是正确的。我们希望各级人民政府和全体小学教师坚决地贯彻这一方针，争取全国小学教育的安定。然后在原有的基础上，逐步地提高小学的质量，并逐步地求其发展，争取在今后五年内做到全国学龄儿童百分之八十入学。
    其次，今后教育工作中最严重的问题是各级学校的师资不足。估计在一九五七年前全国缺少小学教师约一百万人，工农业余学校缺少专任教师约二十万人，中等学校缺少师资约十三万人，高等学校缺少师资一万余人，幼儿园的教养员最少要几万人。这百余万师资从那里来？首先要从各级师范学校中培养出来。但现有师范教育的基础却很弱。现在全国高等师范学校仅二十九所，其中独立设置的仅十七所，学生仅一万一千五百多人。此外尚有附设在大学文学院的三十二个教育系，学生一千五百多人。中等师范学校共六○三所，学生十六万七千余人。这样的数量，已远不能适应现在规模的中等和初等学校师资的要求，当然更不能应付发展的需要。同时，目前各级师范学校除少数有较好的成绩外，一般地方针任务不明确，课程教材未改造，设备差，因此它们培养出来的人才还是暂时难于胜任地当一个合乎标准的人民教师的。此次会议对于怎样调整、整顿和巩固各级师范学校，作了各项具体的规定。这些都是必要的和正确的。这些规定一经正式公布，我们应该努力执行。同时应根据需要与可能，制定各级师范学校调整与发展的计划，逐步实施，这样来用正规的办法培养一部分完全合乎标准的人民教师。
    为了解决初等教育和中等教育所迫切需要的大量师资，除整顿和发展正规的师范教育外，还应着重地采取各种短期训练的方法，迅速有效地培养大批师资。正规培养与短期训练，两者不可偏废；而在今后若干年内，还应以后者为重点。片面强调正规的师范教育，仅仅依靠正规方法训练师资是赶不上客观的需要的；同时，片面地强调短期训练，而轻视正规的师范教育，那就会使师资训练没有标准，这也是不对的。
    要使上述的方针和决定变成事实，我们必须有正确的工作精神和工作方法。全体教育工作者应该深切认识，我们目前所处的环境还是战争环境，我们的一切工作，都应从战争的现实出发。在我们面前确实有许多困难，但是我们是有办法，有希望的。我们应该用什么办法来进行我们的工作？不是用保守的和陈旧的办法，而应该发扬革命的精神，用革命的办法，来克服困难，解决问题。例如，发展小学和培养教师都是有困难的，但经验证明，在过去长期的革命战争中，我们不是同样能办许多学校，能培养出大批优秀的人才吗？在当前的战争情况下，国家财政还有困难，我们办学校，就应力求节省，建筑和设备的标准应该放低一些，应该暂时不盖高楼大厦，一般地都应盖平房，提倡一个钱当两个钱用，一个人当两个人用，同时应该切实依靠群众，发挥各方面的力量来办教育。这样做，我们的困难是能够克服的。又如解决小学以及工农初等教育的师资问题。我们应该继续提倡以民教民的群众教师和小先生的办法，以及学校实行二部制等办法。又如改革课程和改进教学方法，我们也应该用革命的精神和革命的办法，首先帮助教师学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，开展自我批评和批评，通过教学研究组织，来坚决地实现这种改革。总之，今后的教育工作，必须抛弃保守态度和客观主义，必须实行由战争的环境出发，按照事物的发展规律办事，有远见，有前途，实事求是，在任何困难面前不屈服的革命态度和革命办法。这样，人民教育事业才能克服困难而胜利前进。
    最后，我们还要提一提当前小学教育中有一部分教师不安心教学的现象。这种现象在目前是局部的和暂时的，但我们应该重视这种现象，并迅速加以改变。新中国的人民教师是极其光荣的称号。他们担负着教育新后代的崇高任务，是人民政府联系群众的有力助手，是政府政策的宣传者。旧社会遗留下的轻视小学教师的心理和行为必须大力纠正。各级人民政府应充分关心小学教师的生活和学习，并实行奖励优秀教师，帮助他们进步。两年来，全国多数小学教师忍受艰苦，用高度的爱国精神，为人民服务，所以全国小学教育能迅速恢复，并很快地超过国民党统治时代的水平。特别是灾区的教师，他们在极端困难的条件下，坚持了教育工作和其他群众工作，创造了许多动人的范例。这些都是值得各级人民政府加以表扬和鼓励的。但另一方面，教师们本身应该认识自己还有许多缺点，许多从旧社会遗下来的坏思想和坏作风，应当坚决改正这些缺点，使自己逐步地真正够得上人民教师的光荣称号。新中国的每个人民教师应当认真地学习马克思列宁主义，努力使自己成为一个马克思主义者。因为教师是人们灵魂的工程师，只有我们的头脑被马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想所武装了，我们才能将新中国的新后代塑造成为今天的新民主主义社会和将来的社会主义社会、共产主义社会的积极的和自觉的建设者。
