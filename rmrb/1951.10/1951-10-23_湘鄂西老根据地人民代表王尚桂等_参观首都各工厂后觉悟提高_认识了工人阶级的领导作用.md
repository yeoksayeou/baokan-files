    People's Representatives from the Old Xiang-E-Xi Revolutionary Base, Wang Shanggui and Others,
    Enhance Their Awareness After Visiting Factories in the Capital, Recognizing the Leading Role of the Working Class
    Dear Worker Comrades:
    During our visit to Beijing to attend the National Day celebrations, we toured the North China Farm Implement Factory, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and the Agricultural Mechanization School, which raised our ideological awareness. We saw the many new-style farm tools you manufactured for us farmers, which save both manpower and time. For example, the grass cutter can cut fifty mu in an hour, and the tiller can till sixty mu in an hour, which is a hundred times better than the old-style farm tools. The sprayer can spray pesticides to kill insects, and the water pump can drain a pond of water overnight. The representatives were as delighted as if they had found treasures when they saw these things.
    Thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's leadership in the revolution, the workers and peasants have turned over and become masters of the country. Only then could we, the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, come to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, and only then could we meet with the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and meet with the worker comrades. This is not an easy thing. We realize that only with the working class in leadership, and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation, uniting the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic and democratic elements, can we transform our country from an agricultural country into an industrialized country, carry the revolution through to the end, and achieve a new socialist and communist society in the future, and obtain a happier life.

    湘鄂西老根据地人民代表王尚桂等
    参观首都各工厂后觉悟提高
    认识了工人阶级的领导作用工人老大哥：
    我们这次来北京参加国庆典礼，曾参观了华北农具工厂、石景山钢铁工厂、华北农业机械总厂、机耕学校，提高了我们的思想觉悟。我们看到你们替我们农民制造的许多新式农具，既省人力，又省时间。像割草机，一小时能割五十亩，耕田机一小时能耕六十亩，要比旧式农具强百倍。喷雾器能喷药水杀虫子，抽水机能将一塘大水一夜即抽干。代表们看见这些东西，如同见了宝贝一样。
    多亏毛主席、共产党领导革命，工人、农民翻了身，做了国家的主人，我们烈、军、工属才能到北京来参加国庆典礼，我们才和中国人民伟大领袖毛主席见了面，和工人老大哥见了面。这是很不容易的事。我们认识到，只有工人阶级当领导，工农联盟做基础，团结小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子，把我们国家从农业国变成工业化的国家，把革命进行到底，将来才能达到社会主义、共产主义的新社会，得到更幸福的生活。
