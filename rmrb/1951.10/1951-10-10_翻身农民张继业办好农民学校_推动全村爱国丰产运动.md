To the Editor:

    Huangyan Village in She County, Hebei Province, used to be a small, culturally-lacking mountain village. Now, it has a farmers' school, and all fifty-seven young men and women in the village are enrolled. Twenty village cadres have organized themselves for study, and thirty-six adults and nine elderly people are participating in political propaganda training classes. During the busy farming season this spring, the teaching work of the farmers' school did not stop. The farmers' school has promoted the patriotic production increase movement, and these achievements are inseparable from Zhang Jiyue's leadership and promotion.

    Zhang Jiyue is a turned-over peasant. He actively studies in his work and now has a cultural level equivalent to that of a senior primary school graduate. After being trained in the county in the winter of 1949, he tried every means to run the village's farmers' school well. At the beginning of spring plowing this year, Zhang Jiyue thought that farmers were busy participating in production, and the farmers' school might be difficult to consolidate, so he discussed with the village cadres how to improve everyone's production enthusiasm through learning. He mobilized everyone to make patriotic production increase plans and study plans in the farmers' school, which encouraged everyone's production and learning enthusiasm. Since the village implemented the production increase plan, spring plowing and summer weeding have been completed ahead of schedule, and it is estimated that each mu of land can produce one more dou of coarse grain than last year. At the end of July, a test was held, and each person learned an average of 180 characters. Everyone felt that the farmers' school was very good, not only did they learn culture, but also improved production.

    When the People's Government called for cotton planting this spring, Zhang Jiyue proposed the slogan "Everyone is responsible for resisting America and aiding Korea, plant more cotton to win more battles." The village did not have the habit of growing cotton, but after the propaganda and mobilization of the farmers' school students, the village launched a rush to plant patriotic cotton movement. Within three days, the whole village planted 115 mu of cotton, more than twice that of previous years.

    Now Huangyan Village has been listed as a model village for first-class farmers' schools in the county. Zhang Jiyue was elected as a special-class model teacher twice in the winter of 1950 and the spring of 1951, and this autumn he also attended the special district cultural model conference. Zhang Jiyue's spirit of actively running civil schools and the method of closely combining political and production propaganda in teaching work are worthy of our learning.

### 翻身农民张继业办好农民学校  推动全村爱国丰产运动

    翻身农民张继业办好农民学校  推动全村爱国丰产运动编辑同志：
    河北涉县黄岩村，过去是个缺少文化的山坳小村，现在有了农民学校，全村五十七个男女青年全部入学，二十个村干部组织起来进行学习，三十六个壮年人和九个老年人参加了政治宣传讲习班。今春农忙的时候，农民学校的教学工作都没有停顿。农民学校推进了爱国丰产运动，这些成绩是和张继业的带头、推动分不开的。
    张继业是个翻身农民。他在工作中积极学习，现在已经有了相当于高小的文化程度。一九四九年冬季在县集训以后，他想尽了各种办法，要把村里的农民学校办好。今年春季春耕开始时，张继业想到农民都忙于参加生产，农民学校恐怕难以巩固，就和村干部商量，如何通过学习去提高大家的生产热情。他发动大家在农民学校订立了爱国增产计划和学习计划，鼓舞了大家的生产和学习热情。该村执行增产计划以来，春耕夏锄都提早完成，估计每亩地可比去年多打一斗粗粮。七月底举行了测验，平均每人学到一百八十个字。大家都觉得农民学校很好，不但学了文化，而且还提高了生产。
    当今年春季人民政府号召种棉时，张继业就提出“抗美援朝人人有责，多种棉花多打胜仗”的口号。该村本来没有种棉的习惯，但经过农民学校学员的宣传发动，该村乃展开了抢种爱国棉运动。三天内全村种棉一百十五亩，超过往年两倍。
    现在黄岩村已被列为全县头等农民学校模范村。张继业在一九五○年冬和一九五一年春，两次当选为特等模范教师，今年秋季又出席了专区文化模范大会。张继业这种积极办民校的精神和在教学工作上紧密结合政治及生产宣传办法，是值得我们学习的。
