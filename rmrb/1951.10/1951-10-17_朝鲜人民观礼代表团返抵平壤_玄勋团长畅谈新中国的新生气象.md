    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th. The Korean People's Observation Delegation, led by Head of Delegation Hyun Heun, which was invited to Beijing to attend the celebrations for the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, has returned here. On the 14th, Head of the Delegation Hyun Heun spoke to reporters about his impressions of his visit to China, saying: "Although our stay in Beijing was short, having been invited to participate in the celebrations for the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we were indescribably excited to see the new vitality of New China under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. The celebration rally on October 1 fully demonstrated the glorious development and tremendous achievements of the People's Republic of China over the past two years. Delegations from the people of various democratic countries, led by the Soviet Union, participated in the celebration ceremony. People from Southeast Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, Burma, and Indonesia also sent observation delegations, which shows the international significance of the victory of New China's construction."
    Head of Delegation Hyun Heun said: "On the evening of September 30, we attended a grand celebration banquet personally hosted by Chairman Mao Zedong. Chairman Mao cordially shook hands with each of the more than one thousand guests and raised his glass to celebrate together, which made all those invited feel supremely honored and grateful."
    After introducing in detail the unprecedented grandeur of the grand military parade and the 400,000-person demonstration parade held in Tiananmen Square on October 1, Head of Delegation Hyun Heun said: "The various arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army demonstrated the great power of the Chinese people's armed forces, tempered through thirty years of revolutionary war; the magnificent militia contingents and the marching masses of workers and students demonstrated the infinite reserve strength of the people of New China in the struggle to win Asian and world peace."
    Head of Delegation Hyun Heun said: "Our Korean People's Observation Delegation went to hospitals to express sympathy to the wounded and sick of the Chinese People's Volunteers and visited the families of the Volunteers, expressing the lofty respect of the Korean people for them."
    Head of Delegation Hyun Heun said: "We saw everywhere the great strength displayed by the Chinese working people in the construction cause. The heavy industry of New China has made amazing progress in just two short years. We participated in a symposium organized by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and heard many reports on the rapid growth of the Chinese working class and its advanced role."
    Head of Delegation Hyun Heun said: "After returning from our visit to China, our delegation deeply felt that the people of Asian countries can only enjoy true freedom and happiness by learning from the example of the victorious Chinese people and defeating the imperialist aggressors. Today, in the just war against American aggression, the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples, forged with blood, cannot be destroyed by any force. All comrades of our delegation deeply feel proud that the Korean people are neighbors with the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. We have further strengthened our infinite confidence in the bright future of the Korean people."

    【新华社平壤十六日电】应邀前往北京参加中华人民共和国第二届国庆节庆祝典礼的朝鲜人民观礼代表团，在团长玄勋率领下，已返抵此间。观礼代表团团长玄勋十四日对记者谈访华观感称：我们此次应邀参加中华人民共和国诞生两周年庆祝典礼，在北京停留的时间虽短，但是看到伟大的毛泽东主席和中国共产党所领导的新中国的一片新生气象，真有说不出的兴奋。十月一日的庆祝大会，充分显示了中华人民共和国两年来的光辉发展和巨大的成就。以苏联为首的各民主国家人民代表团都参加了庆祝大典。印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、印度尼西亚等东南亚各国人民，也都派遣了观礼代表团，这说明了人民中国建设事业的胜利所具有的国际意义。
    玄勋团长说：九月三十日晚，我们参加了毛泽东主席所亲自主持的盛大庆祝宴会。毛主席亲切地与一千余位来宾一一握手并举杯共同欢庆，使全体应邀与会者感到无上光荣和感激。
    玄勋团长在详细地介绍了十月一日在天安门广场举行的盛大阅兵式和四十万人示威游行的空前盛况后说：受检阅的中国人民解放军各兵种部队显示了经三十年革命战争而百炼成钢的中国人民武装的伟大威力；雄壮民兵队伍和工人学生游行大军，显示了在争取亚洲与世界和平的斗争中，新中国人民无穷的后备力量。
    玄勋团长说：我们朝鲜人民观礼代表团曾到医院慰问中国人民志愿军伤病员，并访问了志愿军的家属，表达了朝鲜人民对他们的崇高敬意。
    玄勋团长说：我们到处看到了中国劳动人民在建设事业中所发挥的伟大力量。新中国的重工业，在短短的两年中已有了惊人的发展。我们曾参加中华全国总工会所主办的座谈会，听到了许多有关中国工人阶级迅速成长及其先进作用的报告。
    玄勋团长说：访华归来，我们代表团深切地感到：亚洲各国人民只有学习胜利了的中国人民的榜样，打败帝国主义侵略者，才能享受真正的自由和幸福。今天在反对美国侵略的正义战争中，用血结成的中朝两国人民的友谊团结，是任何力量也不能摧毁的。我们代表团全体同志深深地以朝鲜人民与伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国为邻而感到骄傲。我们对于朝鲜人民的美好将来，更加强了无限的信心。
