Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: People from all walks of life in Beijing and Tianjin are using practical actions of enthusiastically contributing funds for airplanes and artillery to greet the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the Korean War.

The people of Beijing have now paid over 66 billion yuan, accounting for over 63 percent of the total pledged amount. Among these, the donations from various organizations and groups are enough to purchase fourteen fighter planes. Workers throughout the city have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, striving to increase production for donation. The workers of the Power Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, through voluntary labor and donating bonuses, contributed 25 million yuan in one month, exceeding the department's original donation plan by 40 percent. The Mentougou Coal Mine's Mechanical and Electrical Plant also exceeded its original plan by over 37 percent. After completing the payment of more than half of the donations before National Day, the business community in the city is now engaged in a competition to complete all donations by the end of November.

The people of Tianjin have now paid over 88.4 billion yuan, accounting for over 58 percent of the total pledged amount. Among these, workers' donations have reached 8.6 billion yuan, accounting for over 74 percent of the total pledged by workers. The business community has paid 60.4 billion yuan, completing over 50 percent of the total pledged by the business community. The Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce has also formulated a plan to increase production for donation, striving to exceed the original plan of donating the equivalent of eighty fighter planes. The city's trade union system originally pledged over 930 million yuan, but has now actually paid over 1.02 billion yuan. Labor and management of private factories in the city have also signed patriotic agreements to increase production for donation, further developing the movement to increase production for donation. In August and September, Hengyuan Textile Factory donated over 320 million yuan from excess profits, and Dongya Enterprise Company also donated over 310 million yuan in July and August.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report: Rural areas in Northern Jiangsu are using local cooperatives to collect grain donations from farmers for airplanes and artillery, greatly facilitating farmers and enabling them to complete donation plans on schedule.

The total amount of donations paid in Northern Jiangsu has now reached over 37.589 billion yuan, accounting for over 71.5 percent of the total pledged amount in the region, of which donations from rural masses account for approximately 60 percent. Farmers in Jianhu, Gaoyou, PiSui, and Jiangdu counties have all exceeded their total donation plans.

The amount of pledges for airplanes and artillery from farmers in Northern Jiangsu accounts for approximately 65 percent of the total pledged amount in the region. Therefore, how to organize farmers to pay after the autumn harvest has become an important part of the donation movement. At the beginning of August, when the autumn harvest began, the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, together with relevant departments such as the People's Bank, the state-owned grain company, and the cooperative association, discussed methods for rural masses to pay their donations, deciding that nearly a thousand rural grassroots cooperatives throughout the region would be responsible for collecting the donations. If farmers lacked currency, they could use local major grains as substitutes, and the cooperatives would issue receipts based on the type and quantity of grain, converted at the state-owned grain company's price. The grain and cash collected by the cooperatives would be submitted to the grain company and the People's Bank respectively, with accounts reported in a timely manner and announced regularly. The Resist America, Aid Korea Associations in each county, based on this decision, convened meetings of relevant departments to formulate payment methods suitable for the specific conditions of the region. Jianhu County established five grain payment points to solve the difficulties in areas lacking cooperatives. Funing County convened a meeting of the directors of nineteen grassroots cooperatives, dividing the grain payment areas according to the distribution of each cooperative and the distance of each administrative village. Gaoyou County temporarily strengthened the staffing of cooperatives. Because the cooperatives and grain payment points were located in market towns or larger villages, with convenient locations and transportation, and because most areas implemented collective payments by groups or villages and townships, it greatly facilitated the farmers and improved the efficiency of cooperatives in quickly collecting and submitting donations. After leading the farmers to make collective payments, village and township cadres in many areas promptly announced the accounts by household or by person, and the farmers were very satisfied.

    京津两市人民踊跃缴纳飞机大炮献款
    苏北农村合作社代收捐献粮款便利农民完成捐献计划
    【新华社十七日讯】北京和天津两市各界人民，以踊跃缴纳飞机大炮献款的实际行动，迎接中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年纪念日。
    北京市人民现已缴款六百六十亿余元，占该市人民认捐总数的百分之六十三强。其中各机关团体缴纳的献款，已可购买十四架战斗机。全市职工更发挥了高度的爱国热情，努力增产捐献。石景山钢铁厂动力部职工以义务劳动和捐献奖金等办法，一个月内捐献了二千五百万元，超过该部原订捐献计划的百分之四十。门头沟煤矿机电厂也超过了原订计划的百分之三十七强。该市工商界在国庆节前完成缴纳半数以上的献款后，现在各行业间，又为争取在十一月底前缴清全部献款而展开竞赛。
    天津市人民现已缴款八百八十四亿余元，占该市认捐总数的百分之五十八强。其中工人缴款已达八十六亿元，占工人认捐总数的百分之七十四强。工商界已缴款六百零四亿元，完成工商界认捐总数的百分之五十以上。该市工商业联合会并又订出增产捐献计划，争取超额完成捐献八十架战斗机的原订计划，该市店员工会系统原来认捐九亿三千万余元，现在已实缴十亿二千万余元。该市私营工厂劳资双方，也纷纷订了爱国增产捐献协议，使增产捐献运动得到进一步发展。恒源纺织厂八、九两月便从超额利润中捐献了三亿二千万余元，东亚企业公司在七、八月中，也捐献了三亿一千万余元。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：苏北各地农村通过当地合作社代收农民捐献飞机大炮的粮款，使农民得到很大便利，按期完成了捐献计划。
    苏北全区缴款数字现在已达三百七十五亿八千九百余万元，占全区认捐总数的百分之七十一点五强，其中农村群众缴款约占百分之六十左右。建湖、高邮、邳睢、江都等四县农民都已超额完成全部捐献计划。
    苏北区农民认捐飞机大炮的数字，约占全区认捐总数百分之六十五左右，因而在秋收后如何组织农民缴款，就成为捐献运动中的重要环节。八月上旬秋收开始的时候，苏北区抗美援朝分会就会同人民银行、国营粮食公司、合作总社等有关部门协商农村群众缴款的办法，决定由全区近千个农村基层合作社负责代收，农民如缺乏货币，可以当地主要粮食代替，由合作社根据粮食种类、数量，按国营粮食公司牌价折价填发收据；合作社所收粮食和现金分别交粮食公司和人民银行，账目及时上报，定期公布。各县抗美援朝分会都根据此一决定，召集有关部门开会，订出了适合本区具体情况的缴款办法。建湖县为解决少数缺少合作社的地区的困难，特建立了五个缴粮点。阜宁县召集了十九个基层合作社主任开会，根据各社分布情况和每个行政村的距离，划分了缴粮地区。高邮县临时加强了合作社干部配备。由于合作社和缴粮点都设在集镇或较大村庄上，地点适中，交通便利，同时大部分地区都以小组或村、乡为单位，实行集体缴款，因而大大便利了农民，并提高了合作社迅速集中和上解捐款的工作效率。许多地区乡村干部在领导农民集体缴款后，及时地按户或按人公布了账目，农民一致感到十分满意。
