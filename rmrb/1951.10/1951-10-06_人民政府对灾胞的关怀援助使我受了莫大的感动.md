To the Editor:

    I am from the Qinghe and Machong River areas in western Liaoning Province, Northeast China. This August, nearly a hundred villages in Kaiyuan and Tieling counties in my hometown suffered the most severe flooding in decades. The concern and assistance of the People's Government and compatriots throughout the country for the disaster area have deeply moved me.

    After the flood occurred in my hometown, local and neighboring county cadres, as well as the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kaiyuan County, immediately mobilized to rescue the disaster victims; rescue personnel also rushed from faraway Harbin. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, personally dispatched a plane, braving the harsh weather, to the disaster area, airdropping large quantities of life-saving equipment and food to the afflicted victims. The Northeast People's Government also transferred hundreds of wooden boats and sailors from Yingkou and other places to rush to the rescue. Thanks to the timely rescue efforts of the People's Government, most of the victims escaped danger and found shelter. Special thanks and recognition should be given to Comrade Durasov, a Soviet expert and Director of the Shenyang Branch of the China Changchun Railway, for his noble internationalist spirit. At a critical moment, he disregarded his own safety and managed to save the lives of more than 150 people from the floodwaters. Afterward, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Yang Yichen, Chairman of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, personally went to the disaster area to express their condolences to the victims. Recently, the Central People's Government also dispatched the "Northeast Flood Condolence Delegation" to express their sympathy, and the Government Administration Council allocated 100,000 tons of relief grain to help the victims resume production and rebuild their lives. The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting arduously on the front lines in Korea, sent letters of sympathy and supplies from faraway foreign lands to express their concern and provide relief to their compatriots in the disaster-stricken areas of the motherland. Such profound friendship within our great motherland family is truly touching!

    These events tell us that only a government of the people can be so deeply concerned about the hardships of the people. Only with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the people receive warmth. I hope that the disaster-stricken compatriots, under the leadership of the People's Government, will work hard to resume production, rebuild their lives, and reconstruct our beautiful homeland!

### 人民政府对灾胞的关怀援助使我受了莫大的感动

    人民政府对灾胞的关怀援助使我受了莫大的感动编辑同志：
    我是东北辽西省清河和马仲河沿岸的人。今年八月，我的家乡开原、铁岭两县有近百个村庄遭受了数十年来没有过的严重水灾。人民政府和祖国同胞对灾区的关怀和援助，使我受到莫大的感动。
    家乡发生水灾后，当地的和邻县的干部以及驻开原县的人民解放军立即出动抢救灾民；从遥远的哈尔滨也赶来了抢救人员。东北人民政府高岗主席曾亲自派飞机冒着恶劣的气候赶赴灾区，空投大批救生器具和食物给受难的灾民，东北人民政府还从营口等地调了数百只木船和水手，赶往营救。由于人民政府及时抢救，大部分灾民脱了险，有了住所。这里特别应该感谢和学习的是中长铁路沈阳分局局长苏联专家杜拉索夫同志的崇高的国际主义精神，他在紧急关头，不顾自己生命危险，设法从洪水中救出了一百五十多个人的生命。之后，东北人民政府林枫副主席和辽西省人民政府杨易辰主席亲往灾区慰问灾民。中央人民政府最近又派遣“东北水灾慰问团”前往慰问，政务院又拨发了救济粮十万吨，扶助灾民生产自救。在朝鲜前线艰苦作战的中国人民志愿军指战员从遥远的国外寄来了慰问信和物资，慰问和救济祖国受灾的同胞，这种祖国大家庭的深厚友爱是多么令人感动呵！
    这些事情告诉我们，只有人民自己的政府，才能这样深切地关心人民的疾苦。只有有了共产党、毛主席的领导，人民才能得到温暖。我希望受灾的同胞在人民政府领导下，好好生产自救，重建美好家园！
