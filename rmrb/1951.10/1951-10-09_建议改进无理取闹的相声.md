    Suggestion to Improve Nonsensical Crosstalk
    To the Editor:
    On September 23rd, I went to the Shengping Amusement Park in Dong'an Market, Beijing, to see a variety show. Some of the performances were very good and played a certain role in promoting patriotic education; however, several crosstalk performances were very boring and unsatisfactory. The second crosstalk performance, starring Zhang Hongbin, consisted entirely of two people cursing each other from beginning to end. The third crosstalk performance, a collaboration between Zhang Hongbin and Zhang Qiming called "Watching Foreign Films," also consisted of scolding. Some of the words were simply insulting to the audience.
    This kind of nonsensical crosstalk provides no education to the audience. I suggest that the performing arts community improve it.

### 建议改进无理取闹的相声

    建议改进无理取闹的相声编辑同志：
    九月二十三日，我到北京东安市场升平游艺社看了一次杂耍。其中有几个节目很好，在爱国主义的宣传教育方面起了一定作用；但有几个相声节目，内容十分无聊，不能令人满意。第二场相声是张鸿宾主演的，从开场到结束都是两人对骂。第三场相声是张鸿宾和张启明合演的“看拉洋片”，内容也是谩骂。有些话简直是在侮辱观众。
    这种无理取闹的相声，不能给观众任何教育，建议曲艺界加以改进。
