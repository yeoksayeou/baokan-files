Reader Letters

    Celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!
    Workers, peasants, and others petition Chairman Mao to celebrate National Day

       Yang Dongzheng, Eighth Large Station of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
       National Day Report on overcoming difficulties and gloriously completing the rush transport mission, Dear Chairman Mao:
    We have been away from our motherland for more than half a year. After this period of testing, we have a clearer understanding of love and hate. Your loveliness, the loveliness of the motherland, the loveliness of the people of the motherland, the loveliness of the comrades at the front and the Korean People's Army, the loveliness of the great Soviet people and army; we also deeply experienced the hatred of American imperialism, the hatred of the enemy's massacre of the Korean people, the hatred of indiscriminate bombing by airplanes, and the hatred of sabotage by special agents.
    We also learned about honor and shame. It is an honor to dare to fight against airplanes, an honor to complete the task, an honor to cherish supplies, an honor to be thrifty, and an honor to maintain good Sino-Korean relations; at the same time, we also feel it is shameful to have accidents, shameful to suffer losses, shameful to fail to complete the task, shameful to be afraid of airplanes, shameful to waste public property, and shameful to violate mass discipline.
    When the mountain torrents broke out, the bridges, highways, and railways were all washed away. If we couldn't send grain to the front, the troops wouldn't have food, and if we couldn't send ammunition, it would affect the battle. We had to build bridges, repair roads, and transport supplies. Although everyone's work was different, everyone's thinking was the same: not to let the soldiers at the front go hungry, to have food and supplies, and not to let supplies be damaged. Everyone went from not knowing how to knowing how, from unfamiliar to familiar, from slow to fast, improved the efficiency of loading and unloading, created ring roads, increased driving speed, learned how to fight against airplanes, and transferred more than 20 million catties of supplies, defeating the enemy and enemy aircraft.
    This is just the beginning of the work. We will not be proud, but will work even harder and learn humbly to complete the glorious, great, and arduous task entrusted to us by the people of the motherland. Please rest assured. I wish you good health!
         Yang Dongzheng, Eighth Large Station of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
       Staff members of the Urban Planning Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government
            Guarantee to work and study hard to build a great capital, Dear Chairman Mao:
    On the evening of September 28, we held a forum to celebrate National Day with excitement. The victories of our people's cause in the past two years are endless. We thought of the imperialists and reactionaries who used to run rampant in our country, harming the people; today, we have stood up and defeated them. In the old society, technicians were only tools of the rulers; today, they are the masters of the country. In the land of the motherland, we can contribute our strength to serve the people. Unemployment and hunger used to threaten us, but now, even during the period of resisting America and aiding Korea, the government still cares about our lives.
    In the vast land of our motherland, three great movements are in full swing. For the sake of resisting America and aiding Korea, the donation movement is in full swing; the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has further consolidated the people's democratic system; and more than 300 million peasants have been distributed land. All of this is unprecedented in history. We also talked about the arduous project of harnessing the Huai River and the achievements of the construction of the People's Railways. We described our own jet airplanes, we thought of the stable prices, and we talked more cordially about our own progress and our own participation in the construction work of Beijing. In just two years, despite the financial difficulties, urban planning work is gradually unfolding; in the old society, this was just a dream. All of this is our lovely motherland; all of this is our superior new democratic system. Today we can see tomorrow, and this year we can see next year, moving towards the bright future of socialism. The great allied country of the Soviet Union is our model. We talked about these victories, and these victories are inseparable from your wise leadership. We feel glory and pride. What makes us most glorious and proud is that our motherland has Chairman Mao! We shouted long live the great motherland! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! We sang "The East is Red", and we sang about our motherland.
    Dear Chairman Mao: In the past two years, we have worked hard in our own positions and actively participated in the production increase and donation movement. On National Day, we assure you that we will work and study even harder in the future to build a great capital.
    We are writing this letter to celebrate our National Day, cheer for our victory, and wish you good health and guide us forward forever!
            Chen Zhanxiang and 33 other staff members of the Urban Planning Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government
            Shanghai Locomotive Depot, First Repair Team
            Striving to become first-class backbone members, Dear Chairman Mao:
    We think of you all the time, just as you care about us all the time. In the two years since liberation, we have been continuously improving in our political and cultural lives. Our labor model representative Ma Shusheng from Locomotive No. 1351 participated in the National Railway Labor Model Conference. We are taking this best opportunity to report to you our current free and happy life and production situation.
    All the comrades in our repair team work hard on weekdays to continuously improve the quality of locomotives, so that Locomotive No. 1351 has completed 200,000 kilometers of safe travel, and Locomotive No. 36 has extended 20,000 kilometers of first-level inspection. Therefore, the national maintenance cost has been greatly reduced. Since the implementation of soft water (injecting medicine into the locomotive boiler to turn hard water containing too many minerals into soft water, so as to prevent scale from forming in the boiler) in the depot, the scale in the boiler has been reduced. We have increased the washing furnace kilometers of each locomotive from 2,800 kilometers to 6,000 kilometers, and two locomotives have already achieved a record of washing the furnace once every 8,000 kilometers. Due to the continuous improvement of locomotive quality, the locomotives repaired by our team have become members of the model locomotive team.
    When repairing locomotives, we try to use waste materials as much as possible without affecting the quality of the locomotive, thus saving 30% of materials in August. At the same time, since April 8th of this year, our First Repair Team has achieved a new record of safely repairing 174 locomotives without accidents, and six more are about to become backbone members of the model locomotive team with 180 safe and accident-free repairs. With a humble attitude of not being arrogant and learning from the masses, we have formulated a plan to strive to repair 260 locomotives without accidents on the basis of completing 180 units, and become first-class backbone members.
    Not only are we working hard in our work, but we are also combining the movement to resist America and aid Korea and defend our country, responding to the three major calls of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, revising the patriotic pact first in the depot, donating half of all bonuses to purchase airplanes and cannons, and sending representatives every month to visit and support the families of railway workers supporting the front.
    Finally, we would like to make the following guarantees to you: 1. Do a good job in the three-package (package repair, package inspection, package ride) contact work, strengthen the re-inspection (that is, check again) system, and resolutely eliminate all accidents; 2. Guarantee to strengthen political, cultural, and technical learning; 3. In order to cultivate national construction talents, we guarantee to improve the technology of apprentices to the level of helpers within half a year; 4. Guarantee to participate in the red flag competition in the depot and strive to get the red flag; 5. Respond to the call of the motherland at any time and actively support the front.
                        Shanghai Railway Administration Shanghai Branch
                  All workers of the First Repair Team of Shanghai Locomotive Depot
            Antenna Engineering Team of the Broadcasting Administration
            Guarantee to complete the iron tower project on schedule, Dear Chairman Mao:
    As we write this letter to you, our iron tower still has forty meters to go. However, everyone of us has this determination: to ensure that you can see the victorious red flag flying on our repaired iron tower on Tiananmen Gate Tower on October 1st—the National Day of our great motherland.
    We started building this iron tower on June 23 this year, which is currently the tallest building on the ground in our country. When we accepted this glorious task, the higher authorities called on us to complete it by the end of September, and especially required us to complete it safely. We can report to you: so far, we have not had any casualties. We assure you: we will definitely work hard to complete it safely.
                    All employees of the Antenna Engineering Team of the Broadcasting Administration
        (Editor's note: The iron tower repaired by this team was completed ahead of schedule on September 27.)
            Labor Model Pei Deyun from Xihua County, Henan, reports on the new changes in his thoughts and life in the past two years, Dear Chairman Mao:
    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, I would like to report to you on the new changes in my life and thoughts in the past two years. In terms of life, I used to be a poor family without an acre of land. Although I opened up 28 acres of wasteland after liberation, I still had difficulties in terms of livestock, farm tools, and seeds, and I was also flooded, so the crops did not yield well. In the past two years, thanks to the government's vigorous lending of livestock, farm tools, seeds, and other various loans, all the difficulties in production have been overcome. Last year, the government used work as relief and led us to repair and dig the Ying River, eliminating the floods. Because of my active participation in digging the river, I was named a special model for governing the Ying River and gloriously attended the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. The government also awarded me a large yellow cattle. This January, our village also successfully completed land reform. My land increased from 28 acres to 32 acres. In the past two years, I have land, livestock, farm tools, seeds, etc., and the difficulties have also been overcome. The land has also changed from barren to fertile, and the grain has been harvested more. Last year, my land yielded a maximum of 70 catties of wheat per acre, and this year it yielded 105 catties per acre, which is 50 catties more per acre compared to the year before last. In addition to paying public grain and donating airplanes and cannons for the grain I harvested, I plan to use the remaining grain to engage in some sideline production during the autumn farming slack season and earn money to build two new houses. In terms of my thoughts, I used to think that it was "bad luck" to be oppressed and exploited by landlords, and that I should endure hunger, but after the land reform movement, I understood that the oppression of landlords and bullies in the past was unreasonable, not poverty, and that I should stand up and fight resolutely against the enemy. Therefore, I actively participated in land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and other movements. After the land reform in our village was completed, I had erroneous ideas such as "eating from a big pot" and "being poor is glorious" in my mind. Only after studying the ten major policies of production did I correct that erroneous idea. However, the idea of "getting rich", "burying myself in production", and "not asking about politics" gradually rose up again; thanks to the timely patriotic education conducted by the Communist Party and the People's Government, pointing out the grand prospects for production and construction, I realized that "patriotic production" and "mutual assistance and cooperation" are the correct path for the development of the new democratic economy. Now my ideological awareness has been improved and my life has also been improved. I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, life will become happier day by day. Finally, I sincerely shout:
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao!
                    Pei Deyun, Labor Model of Xihua, Henan (Zhao Jing's proxy)
            Labor Models and Mutual Aid Group Representatives from Lixian County are going to sell and store all the cotton to the state, Dear Chairman Mao:
    On September 8th, forty-one labor models and forty-five mutual aid group representatives from our county held a forum to summarize the achievements of this year's patriotic production increase movement and exchange production experiences. Everyone felt very happy. Although we suffered from insects, drought, and hailstorms this year, we finally overcame the disasters. The harvest is not bad. Looking at the way the crops are growing, the average yield of cotton per acre can be 120 catties, and sorghum and millet can yield 200 catties. Now the new cotton has dropped its buds, and the autumn crops are about to begin harvesting. Every household is happy and arranges the autumn harvest.
    We also held a "think-think meeting". Thinking of the past is truly grief and indignation, seeing the present is truly grateful, and thinking of the future is even more happy. Looking at your picture, we have an indescribable joy.
    In the past, all the grain we harvested filled the landlord's bottomless pit. This happened year after year, generation after generation. This year, the People's Government lent us more than 500 waterwheels, 400 well loans, and 250 livestock, and also led us to put out aphids in more than 100,000 mu of cotton fields and locust nymphs in 40,000 mu of area, protecting our rice bowls. All of this made us deeply experience that without the leadership and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we would not be able to live a good life. On August 15th, you also sent a visiting group to see us (Editor's note: Lixian County is an old base area in central Hebei). You still care about us so much in your busy schedule, which makes us truly grateful. We must always follow you.
    Now we have also made a patriotic pact. Everyone unanimously volunteered to sell and store all the cotton grown this year (estimated to be 44,000 catties) to the state, and donate 4,350 catties of millet to purchase airplanes and cannons. Our production increase plan for next year has also been prepared. Our 86 people have a total of 1,695 mu of land, leaving 1,445 mu of cotton fields, striving to achieve 200 catties of cotton per mu of dry land and 300 catties per mu of paddy field next year. We will work hard according to the direction you have given us: carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory!
                All labor models and mutual aid group representatives of Lixian County, Hebei
            All the masses of Longgang Village and the model class for governing the Huai River
            Determined to actively participate in the second phase of the Huai River governance project, Dear Chairman Mao:
    During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, our Longgang Village suffered from poor harvests all year round. The landlords and reactionary government still urgently urged the payment of land rent and various kinds of taxes. We would be whipped and roped if we were not there on time. We couldn't eat or wear enough, and life was really hard. At that time, out of 160 households in the village, 156 households were out of food. Many families were separated and went out to flee the famine, and died outside.
    The situation was completely different after liberation. First, the reactionary government was overthrown, and under your leadership and the leadership of the cadres, and with the help of the government, we fought against and overcame the severe drought. When fighting against the flood, all the labor force in our village were organized to dig the river on the embankment, and women and the old and weak were also organized to dig ditches in the rear of the embankment and engage in sideline production. Lao Wang Lake is the first major water hazard here. Now we have dug it and the nearby rivers. This year's harvest is very good. Taking Li Ting'e's family as an example, he has a total of 27 mu of land. This year, he has harvested 5 shi of wheat (30 jin per dou), 1 shi and 7 dou of sorghum, 1 shi of mung beans, and 2 shi of beans. In total, he has harvested more than 9 shi more than last year (last year, he only harvested 6 dou of wheat in total). After repaying the government loan, his family of five has more than enough to eat and drink. He would never have had such a prosperous situation in the past!
    We have repaired all the houses in the village, and 36 households have built new houses. The village has added farm tools, and with the help of the government, they have also bought more than 50 livestock. Our situation is really different from the past, but our wounds have only just healed. We will not forget the past, and we will also do a good job in production, thrift, and donation.
    Dear Chairman Mao! The good times today are brought to us by you, and we are infinitely grateful. Now the second phase of the Huai River governance project is about to begin, and land reform will also be implemented in the village. We are full of unparalleled enthusiasm to welcome these two major tasks. The migrant workers who dig the river have been organized, and the tools have been prepared. Various organizations in the village have also been improved, waiting to make a resolute and thorough struggle against the Huai River disaster left by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the thousands of years of feudal roots.
                  All the masses of Longgang Village, Chongting Township, Shicun District, Suxian County
                                Longgang Village Huai River Governance Model Class
            Shen Ziting, a family member of a volunteer army hero in Chuxian County, wants to support the volunteer army with practical actions, Dear Chairman Mao:
    National Day is coming soon, and I have indescribable joy in my heart. Under your wise leadership, my family has completely changed. I have land, houses, and I was also elected as the director of the Women's Federation of Beiguan Town, Chuxian County, Anhui Province. My second son, Heqin, is now in the Volunteer Army. He made great contributions to the people in the battle of Dechuan. When the good news came, the county magistrate and the secretary of the CPC County Committee came to my house to congratulate me, and the masses called my family the "Glorious Family". I have indescribable joy in my heart! The third son, Jia Hua, and the youngest son are both enrolled in school for free and have now joined the Young Pioneers.
    Dear Chairman Mao, I must repay you with practical actions and support the Volunteer Army. Now, I have organized more than 90 women to listen to the reading group every night. My first phase of the donation plan has been completed, and the second phase will be completed by the end of September. I also assure you that I will work hard to enable all the women in our Beiguan Town to complete the production increase and donation plan to support our Volunteer Army.
                            Shen Ziting, family member of a volunteer army hero
                          (Proxy by Fang Ye)
            Huibao Su Dangsheng, from Lanfeng County, Henan, improved his life and was elected as a model, Dear Chairman Mao:
    On the occasion of celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I report my turnaround situation to you. I am a greedy young Hui from Lanfeng County, Henan Province. I herded sheep and did small business when I was young, and I worked as a porter when I grew up. At that time, I couldn't get enough to eat or wear all year round. The Kuomintang reactionary government also severely bullied our ethnic minorities.
    After the liberation of Lanfeng, I became the head of the administrative group and was elected as a representative of the Hui people. Our Hui people have truly become the masters of the country.
    During the land reform this spring, the People's Government accepted the demands of the masses, shot the evil landlord Ma Xiangchen, and avenged our Hui people. During the land reform, I was also elected as a member of the Township Peasants Association and vice chairman of the Farmers Association in this street. After that, I was admitted to the Communist Youth League.
    During the summer tax this year, because our street paid the public grain the earliest and cleanest, it was rated as a model street in the city. Our group was a model group, and our family was a model household. I was also rated as a summer tax model. I was so happy! In June this year, the crops had aphids. In the work of controlling aphids, I was again rated as a model, and I was also praised and rewarded by the government.
    In the donation movement, I worked even more actively and diligently. Everyone elected me as a donation committee member. Now, our street has overfulfilled the first phase of the donation plan.
                                Su Dangsheng
                                  (Proxy by Wang Chuanqin)
            Teachers of Jinxi Middle School guarantee to educate the second generation conscientiously, Dear Chairman Mao:
    I have been thinking for a long time: on this year's National Day, I must tell Chairman Mao all the words in my heart.
    My family originally belonged to the poor peasant class. During the land reform in the spring of the year before last, we were divided into one hectare, six mu, and four points of land. This summer, the crops were flooded, and not a single grain was harvested. If it wasn't for the People's Government immediately lending us grain, our family of seven would have really had a hard time getting through the drought. During the spring plowing last year, the government also issued goods, grains, seeds, and livestock to the people in our disaster area. Therefore, we had a bumper harvest last year, and we had another bumper harvest this year. With the improvement of the economic life of the people in the Northeast, my salary was also increased in May this year, and I can earn 260 work points per month, making the family life more prosperous. My eldest daughter also wrote a letter to you on the eve of National Day! They all know that this happiness is given by Chairman Mao, and they all thank Chairman Mao!
    I am forty-four years old this year. I am now a people's teacher and have been listed in the ranks of the working class. The young comrades respect me so much. In the old society, I taught for fifteen years and never enjoyed such honor. Now I seem to be younger. For the honor of the country; in order to thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, I and my classmates jointly formulated a patriotic pact, collectively carried out voluntary labor, actively produced, and donated to the motherland. I myself decided to donate one day's salary every month from July until the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. At the same time, I assure you: I will definitely use all my energy to conscientiously educate the second generation, so that they all become useful talents for building and defending the motherland.

    庆祝中华人民共和国成立两周年！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    工人农民等上书毛主席庆祝国庆
       中国人民志愿军某部第八大站  杨栋正
       国庆节报告克服困难光荣完成抢运任务敬爱的毛主席：
    我们离开祖国半年多了。经过这个时期的考验，我们更清楚地认识了爱和憎。您的可爱，祖国的可爱，祖国人民的可爱，前方同志和朝鲜人民军的可爱，伟大的苏联人民和军队的可爱；我们也深刻地体验到美帝国主义的可恨，敌人对朝鲜人民残杀的可恨，飞机滥轰滥炸的可恨，特务破坏的可恨。
    我们还了解到荣和耻。敢和飞机斗争为荣，完成任务为荣，爱护物资为荣，节约为荣，搞好中朝关系为荣；同时也感觉到发生事故可耻，受了损失可耻，完不成任务可耻，怕飞机可耻，浪费公物可耻，违犯群众纪律可耻。
    当山洪暴发了以后，桥梁、公路、铁路都冲坏了，送不上粮食去前方部队就吃不上饭，送不上弹药去就影响战斗，又要架桥，又要修路，还要运输。虽说大家的工作不同，可是大家的思想是一致的：不让前方战士饿肚子，有吃的，有用的，不让物资受损失。大家由不会到会，由生到熟，由慢到快，提高了装卸的效率，创造了环行路，增加了行车速度，学会了和飞机斗争的方法，转运了两千多万斤的物资，战胜了敌人，战胜了敌机。
    这才是工作的开始。我们是不会骄傲的，更要加倍努力，虚心学习，来完成祖国人民所嘱托我们的光荣而伟大的艰巨任务。请您放心。祝您健康！

            保证努力工作和学习，建设伟大的首都敬爱的毛主席：
    九月二十八日晚上，我们怀着兴奋的心情，开了一个庆祝国庆节座谈会。两年来，我们人民事业的胜利是说不完的。我们想到帝国主义者与反动派以前在我们国土上横行霸道，残害人民；今天，我们站起来了，而且打败了它们。在旧社会里，技术人员只是统治者的工具；今天，是国家的主人。在祖国的土地上，可以尽情地贡献自己的力量，为人民服务。以前失业与饥饿威胁着我们，现在，虽然正当抗美援朝时期，政府还这般关怀我们的生活。
    在我们祖国的辽阔广大的土地上，正进行着轰轰烈烈的三大运动，为了抗美援朝，捐献运动搞得热火朝天；镇压反革命运动更巩固了人民民主制度；三亿多的农民，分得了土地。这一切，都是历史上空前的事。我们又谈到了治理淮河的艰巨工程，人民铁道的建设成绩，我们描述着自己的喷气式飞机，我们又想到了物价稳定，我们更亲切地谈着我们自己的进步和我们自己所参加的北京市的建设工作。短短两年里，在财经困难的情况下，都市计划工作正逐步展开；旧社会里，这只不过是梦想。这一切，都是我们可爱的祖国；这一切，都是我们优越的新民主主义制度。我们今天可以看到明天，今年可以看到明年，朝向将来的社会主义的美好前途迈进。伟大的盟邦苏联，就是我们的榜样。我们谈到这些胜利，这些胜利和您英明的领导是分不开的。我们感觉光荣与骄傲。最使我们光荣与骄傲的，就是我们祖国有毛主席！我们高呼伟大的祖国万岁！中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！我们高唱东方红，我们歌唱着我们的祖国。
    亲爱的毛主席：两年来，我们在自己的岗位上努力工作，积极参加了增产捐献运动，在国庆节，我们向您保证：今后一定更努力的工作和学习，建设伟大的首都。
    我们写这封信，庆贺我们的国庆，欢呼我们的胜利，并祝您身体健康，永远引导我们前进！

            上海机务段第一包修组
            争取达成一级基干队员敬爱的毛主席：
    我们时时刻刻想到您，正像您时时刻刻关心我们一样。解放二年来，我们在政治、文化生活上不断地提高着。我们一三五一号机车劳动模范代表马树生参加全国铁路劳动模范大会，我们趁这最好的机会，向您汇报我们现在自由幸福的生活与生产情况。
    我们全包修组同志，平日努力工作，把机车质量不断地提高，使一三五一号机车完成了二十万安全走行公里，三六号机车延长了二万甲检公里，因此大大地降低了国家检修成本。自从段内实行了软水（在机车锅炉内，投入药剂，使含有过多矿物质的硬水成为软水，以免锅炉发生水锈）工作以来，锅炉内的水锈已减少。我们把每台机车的洗炉公里由二千八百公里提至六千公里，而且有二台机车已实行八千公里洗炉一次的纪录，由于机车质量不断地提高，使我们组内所包修的机车都成为模范机车队的队员了。
    在检修机车时，我们在不妨碍机车质量的原则下尽量利用废料，因而八月份节约了材料百分之三十。同时我们第一包修组从今年四月八日起到现在，已达到检修一百七十四台机车安全无事故的新纪录，还有六台就要达成一百八十台检修安全无事故的模范机车队基干队员了。我们抱着不骄不傲、虚心向群众学习的态度，订出计划，要在完成一百八十台的基础上，向二百六十台机车检修无事故、达成一级基干队员而奋斗。
    我们不但在工作上这样努力，而且结合了抗美援朝保家卫国运动，响应了抗美援朝总会三大号召，在段内第一个修订爱国公约，将全部奖金的一半捐献出来购买飞机大炮，并每月推派代表慰问支援前线铁路职工的家属一次。
    最后，我们向您提出以下几点保证：一、做好三包（包修、包检、包乘）联系工作，加强复检（即再检查一次）制度，坚决消灭一切事故；二、保证加强政治、文化、技术学习；三、为了培养国家建设人才，我们保证在半年内将学徒的技术提高到帮工程度；四、保证参加段内红旗竞赛，争取得到红旗；五、随时响应祖国号召，积极支援前线。

            广播事业局天线工程队
            保证如期完成铁塔工程敬爱的毛主席：
    当我们写这封信给您的时候，我们的铁塔还有四十公尺没有完成。可是，我们每个人都抱有这样的决心：保证要让您在十月一日——我们伟大祖国的国庆节—在天安门门楼上，能看到我们修好的铁塔上飘扬着胜利的红旗。
    我们在今年六月二十三日开始建立这座铁塔，这是目前我们祖国地面上最高的建筑物。当我们接受这个光荣任务的时候，上级号召我们要在九月底完成它，尤其重要的是要求我们安全地来完成它。我们可以向您报告：到现在为止，我们还没有发生过任何伤亡事故。我们向您保证：一定努力地安全地完成它。

    在伟大的中华人民共和国成立两周年纪念日到来的时候，我要向您报告两年来我在生活上和思想上的新变化。从生活方面来说，过去俺是穷人家，没有一亩田。解放后虽然开了二十八亩荒地，但因牲畜、农具、种籽方面还有困难，又遭水淹，庄稼收成不好。两年来由于政府大力贷放牲畜、农具、种籽等各种贷款，克服了生产中的一切困难。去年政府以工代赈，领导我们修挖了颍河，消灭了水患。我因为积极参加挖河，被评为特等治颍模范，光荣地出席了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，政府还奖给一头大黄牛。今年一月，俺村又胜利地完成了土地改革。我由二十八亩地增加到三十二亩地。这两年来，我有了土地、牲口、农具、种籽等，困难也克服了，土地也由瘦变肥了，粮食也打的多啦。去年俺一亩地最多打七十斤小麦，今年一亩地打一百零五斤，和前年比较起来每亩多打了五十斤。俺打下的粮食除缴公粮和捐献飞机大炮外，我计划用所余粮食，在秋罢农闲时搞些副业生产，赚下钱修两间新房子。在我思想方面来说，过去受地主的压迫剥削，俺认为是“命苦”，应当忍饥受饿，但是经过土地改革运动后，我懂得了过去受地主恶霸的压迫，是不合理的，不是命穷，应当站起来和敌人做坚强的斗争。因此，我积极参加了土地改革、镇压反革命等运动。在俺村土地改革结束后，我思想上曾存在着“吃大锅饭”、“以贫为荣”等错误思想，学习了生产十大政策以后，才把那种错误思想纠正过来。但“发家致富”、“埋头生产”、“不问政治”的思想，又逐渐上升起来；由于共产党和人民政府及时地向我进行了爱国主义教育，指出生产建设的远大前程，我才明白了“爱国生产”、“互助合作”是新民主主义经济发展的正确道路。现在我的思想觉悟提高了，生活也改善了。我深信在共产党和人民政府的领导下，生活是会一天比一天幸福的。最后我热诚地高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！

            蠡县劳动模范和互助组代表要把全部棉花售储给国家敬爱的毛主席：
    九月八日，我们全县的四十一个劳动模范和四十五个互助组代表，开了一个座谈会，总结了今年开展爱国丰产运动的成绩，交流了生产经验，大家觉得很高兴。今年我们虽然受到虫、旱、雹灾，但到底把灾害战胜了，年景总算不坏，看庄稼长的模样，平均每亩棉花能摘一百二十斤，高粱、谷子能打二百斤。现在新花已经掉了朵，秋庄稼也就要开始收割了，家家户户都欢天喜地，安排秋收。
    我们又开了一个“想想会”。想起过去真是悲愤，看到现在真是感激，想到将来更是快乐。看着您的像片，我们就有一种说不出的高兴。
    过去我们打下的粮食，全都填了地主的没底坑，年年如此，辈辈受穷。今年人民政府贷给我们五百多辆水车，四百多眼水井贷款，二百五十头牲口，又领导我们扑灭了十余万亩棉田的蚜虫，四万亩面积的蝗蝻，保住了我们的饭碗。这一切，使我们深切体验到，要不是共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助，我们是不能把光景过好的。八月十五日，您又派访问团来看望我们（编者按：蠡县为河北中部的老根据地），您在百忙中还这样惦记着我们，真使我们感激，我们一定要永远跟着您走。
    现在我们又订了爱国公约，大家一致自愿把今年种的棉花（估计能摘四万四千斤）全部售储给国家，并捐献小米四千三百五十斤，购买飞机大炮。我们明年的丰产计划也作好了，我们八十六个人共有土地一千六百九十五亩，留出棉田一千四百四十五亩，争取明年达到每亩旱田产棉二百斤，水田三百斤。我们按照您指给我们的方向去努力：发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣！

            龙岗村全体群众和治淮模范班
            决心积极参加治淮第二期工程敬爱的毛主席：
    我们龙岗村在国民党反动派统治时期，常年歉收，地主、反动政府还是紧迫地催缴地租和各种名目的捐税。我们一时不到，就给鞭打绳拴。我们吃不到嘴、穿不上身，生活实在苦得很。那时，全村一百六十户，就有一百五十六户断炊，很多人家妻离子散出去逃荒，死在外边。
    解放以后情形完全不同了。首先打倒了反动政府，又在您的领导和干部的带头下，还靠着政府的帮助，我们与严重的灾荒进行了斗争，并战胜了灾荒。在与水灾作斗争时，我们村的全劳动力都组织起来到河堤上挖河，妇女与老弱也都组织起来在河堤的后方挖沟和进行副业生产。老汪湖是我们这里的第一个大的水害，现在我们已把它和附近的河流都挖好了。今年收成很好，单以李廷鹅一家说，他共有二十七亩地，今年已收了五石麦子（每斗三十斤），一石七斗秫秫、一石绿豆、两石豆子，总起来比去年要多收九石多（去年总共只收六斗麦子），除去归还政府贷款，他全家五口人吃喝有余。往年他那有这富裕光景？！
    我们把全村房屋进行了修补，其中有三十六户已盖了新屋。全村添置了农具，在政府的帮助下还买了五十多头牲口。我们的光景真是今非昔比了，但我们的疮口还只刚刚好起来，我们是不会忘掉过去的，我们还要搞好生产、节约、捐献等工作。
    敬爱的毛主席！今天的好光景是您给我们带来的，我们无限感激。现在治淮第二期工程将要开始，村中还将实行土地改革，我们充满了无比的热情来迎接这两大任务。挖河的民工已经组织好了，工具也已准备齐全，村内各种组织也已健全，等待着向蒋介石匪帮留下的淮河灾害和几千年封建老根作坚决彻底的斗争。

            滁县志愿军功臣家属沈芝亭要用实际行动支援志愿军亲爱的毛主席：
    国庆节快来了，我心中有说不出来的高兴。在您的英明领导下，我家已经完全变了样子。我有了土地，有了房屋，我还当选了皖北滁县北关镇妇女联合会的主任。我的二儿子鹤琴现在是志愿军，德川一仗，他为人民立了大功。喜讯传来，县长、中共县委书记都亲来我家贺功，群众都称我家是“光荣人家”。我心中有说不出的高兴！三儿子家骅和小儿都免费进入学校念书，现在都参加了少年儿童队。
    亲爱的毛主席，我一定要用实际行动来报答您，并支援志愿军。现在，我已组织了九十多个妇女每天晚上到读报组听读报。我的第一期捐献计划已经完成了，第二期九月底可完成。我还向您保证，我将努力工作，使我们北关镇的妇女全部完成增产捐献计划，支援我们的志愿军。

            河南兰封县回胞苏登生改善了生活当选了模范敬爱的毛主席：
    在庆祝中华人民共和国成立二周年的今天，我把我的翻身情况报告给您。我是河南省兰封县城里一个贪苦的回民青年，从小放羊、做小生意，大了扛小工。那时候，我整年吃不饱、穿不暖。国民党反动政府又狠狠地欺侮俺少数民族。
    兰封解放后，我当了行政小组长，又当选了回民代表。我们回民真成了国家的主人。
    今年春天土地改革时，人民政府接受了群众要求，枪毙了恶霸地主马相臣，替俺回民报了仇。在土地改革当中，我又被选为乡农民协会委员兼本街农会副主席。之后，我被吸收参加了青年团。
    今年夏征时，由于俺街缴公粮最早又最干净，被评为全城的模范街，俺组是模范组，俺家是模范户，又评我为夏征模范。我真高兴透啦！今年六月，庄稼生了蚜虫。在治蚜工作中，我又被评为模范，还受到政府的表扬和奖励。
    在捐献运动中，我更积极努力。大家推选我为捐献委员。现在，俺街已超额完成了第一期的捐献计划。

            锦西中学教员保证认真地教育第二代亲爱的毛主席：
    我早就想着：在今年国庆节的时候，一定把我心里的话，都告诉毛主席。
    我的家庭原是贫农成份，前年春季土地改革时，我们分得一垧六亩四分地。这年夏天，庄稼被水淹了，粮食一粒没收，假若不是人民政府立刻贷给我们粮食，一家七口，真难度过灾荒。去年春耕时，政府还给我们灾区人民发给货粮、种籽、牲口，因此，去年我们得了个丰收，今年又得了个大丰收。随着东北人民经济生活的改善，今年五月，我的待遇也提高了，每月能收入二百六十工薪分，家庭生活更加富裕起来。我的大女儿在国庆节前夕，也给您写了一封信咧！他们都知道这幸福是毛主席给的，他们也都感谢毛主席！
    我今年四十四岁了，现在是人民教师，列入工人阶级的队伍里。年青的同志是那样地尊敬我。在旧社会里，我教了十五年书，从来没有享有过这样的荣誉，我现在好像更年青了。为了国家的荣誉；为了答谢毛主席、共产党的恩情，在抗美援朝运动中，我和同学们共同订立了爱国公约，集体进行义务劳动，积极生产，捐献给祖国，我自己并决定从七月份起每月捐献一日工薪，直至抗美援朝最后胜利为止。同时，我向您保证：我一定以我全副精力认真地教育第二代，使他们都成为建设祖国，保卫祖国的有用的人材。
