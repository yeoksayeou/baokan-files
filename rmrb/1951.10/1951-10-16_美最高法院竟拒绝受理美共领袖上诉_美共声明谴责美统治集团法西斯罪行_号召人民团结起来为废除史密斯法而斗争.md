Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th: The United States Supreme Court officially announced on the 9th that it refused to accept the appeal of the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party, and announced that it would uphold the decision made by the Supreme Court in June this year to maintain the unconstitutional verdict of the Federal Court against the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party based on the fascist Smith Act. Seven of the eleven leaders are already serving five-year prison sentences, one has recently been arrested, and the rest have forfeited their bail and are still being searched for by the police.

The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States has issued a statement on this incident, pointing out that the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to accept the appeal of the eleven leaders of the U.S. Communist Party proves that the U.S. ruling group is attempting to accelerate the fascistization of the United States. The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States expresses its greatest indignation at this. The statement condemns the Supreme Court for not even considering the complaints filed by the eleven leaders and the many important documents cited as the basis for the complaints, and for taking a hasty decision on the first day of the hearing, blatantly disregarding the deep concern of millions of Americans for the Bill of Rights and the democratic procedures guaranteed by it. The statement lists various facts to prove the unconstitutional nature of the trial and the resulting serious damage to democracy, freedom, and civil rights. However, the statement points out: Political problems cannot be solved in court, and the final judgment is the American people. They can abolish the Smith Act, just as they have abolished many other laws in the past.

The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States finally paid tribute to the arrested and imprisoned comrades, and called on the people to unite and struggle to stop the rising tide of terror and abolish the fascist Smith Act.

    美最高法院竟拒绝受理美共领袖上诉
    美共声明谴责美统治集团法西斯罪行
    号召人民团结起来为废除史密斯法而斗争
    【新华社十三日讯】纽约消息：美国最高法院九日正式宣布拒绝受理美国共产党十一位领袖的上诉，并宣布维持最高法院今年六月所作关于维持联邦法院根据法西斯的史密斯法对美共十一位领袖的违宪判决的决定。十一位领袖中已有七人在服五年的有期徒刑，一人新近被捕，其余丧失了保释金，现仍在被警察搜捕中。
    美国共产党全国委员会已就这一事件发表声明，指出美国最高法院拒绝受理美共十一位领袖的上诉，证明美国统治集团企图使美国加速法西斯化。美国共产党全国委员会对此表示最大的愤慨。声明谴责最高法院甚至不考虑十一位领袖所提出的诉状与诉状所引为根据的许多重要文件，在开庭第一天便采取轻率的决定，而悍然不顾美国千百万人民对权利法案和该法案所保证的民主程序的深切关怀。声明列举种种事实证明这次审判的违宪性质以及因之而造成的对民主、自由和公民权利的严重损害。但是，声明指出：政治问题在法院是解决不了的，最终的审判是美国人民。他们可以废除史密斯法，正像他们过去废除了许多其他的法律一样。
    美国共产党全国委员会最后向被捕禁的同志们致敬，并号召人民团结起来，为制止日益增涨的恐怖浪潮和废除法西斯的史密斯法而斗争。
