The Soviet Union published a statement from the Soviet government to the United States government on October 18th regarding the Korean situation and Soviet-American relations. The statement pointed out that the situation in Korea occurred because the United States systematically refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and that the stagnation of the armistice negotiations was due to the US and British command in Korea systematically creating obstacles to hinder the smooth progress of the negotiations. After the Soviet government thus exposed the US imperialists' conspiracy to shirk their responsibility for delaying the armistice negotiations, it went on to point out that if the US government genuinely advocated improving Soviet-American relations, it already had many opportunities to act to prove its peaceful intentions, but the US government did not do so. This proves that the United States does not in fact want to improve Soviet-American relations and cooperate with the Soviet Union. The statement finally emphasized that the Soviet government agrees, with the participation of the US government, to review all important unresolved issues and discuss ways to improve international relations – including Soviet-American relations.

The Soviet government's statement once again proves the strength of the Soviet Union's great and unwavering desire for peace. It shattered the provocative actions taken by US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kirk, on behalf of the US government, and exposed the despicable conspiracy of the US imperialists to delay the Korean negotiations and attempt to shirk responsibility. It is an encouragement to the Chinese and Korean people, who are fully resisting the bloody aggression of the United States, and to all the people of the world who sympathize with our struggle.

As everyone knows, due to the strong and continuous blows of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, the US imperialists have suffered significant difficulties in the Korean War: the large-scale annihilation of troops, the enormous consumption of military equipment, the people's unwillingness to support, and the quarrels and hesitations of the imperialist camp. All of this has not only disrupted its timetable for preparing for a world war, but even the dream of conquering Korea by force has had to be reconsidered due to the iron facts. However, on the other hand, an armistice is obviously detrimental to its long-term tense war preparation policy and its objectives in diplomacy and domestic affairs. Therefore, although it accepted the suggestion of Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik to begin armistice negotiations, in the course of the negotiations, despite the fact that the negotiation delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have at all times adopted a solemn and responsible attitude towards the negotiations and the events that may occur in the negotiations, the US imperialists have constantly created various disruptive events and adopted various obstructive measures, using various trivial issues to complicate the negotiations and delay them, so that the negotiations have been suspended for nearly two months and cannot be resumed. This is the delaying tactic adopted by the US imperialists after encountering the contradictory situation of difficulty in fighting the Korean War and unwillingness to stop.

The foolish US imperialists vainly attempt to use this delaying tactic to fight and negotiate at the same time, maintaining tension in order to "contain" and "deplete" our military strength, but the facts prove that it is not us who are being "contained" and "depleted", but themselves. According to statistics from October 25th of last year to October 15th of this year, the casualty rate of the US aggressor army is increasing significantly every day. From October 25th of last year to May 21st of this year, in 209 days, the US military lost an average of 885 soldiers per day. But during their so-called "summer offensive," that is, from May 22nd to September 24th of this year, in 126 days, the casualties of the US aggressor army had increased to 1,291 per day, which is more than 40 percent higher than the losses in the previous seven months. After their so-called "autumn offensive" arrived, their losses increased even more dramatically. From October 1st to October 10th, in ten days, the US aggressor army lost an average of more than 2,540 people per day. And in the three days from October 13th to October 15th, the average daily losses of the US military were more than double this number, with an average of 5,666 casualties per day in the three days. This proves that the US imperialists' hope of reducing consumption by delaying negotiations and fighting and negotiating at the same time has yielded the opposite result, and the recent losses of the US military are increasing more rapidly. So, who is depleting whom after all? As for the US's so-called "containment" of us, it is an unfounded delusion. Our country is not an aggressive country, and we will never invade anyone, but we will never allow anyone to invade our country. Because the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea and extended their aggressive claws into China, the Chinese people could no longer tolerate it, and only then did they organize their own volunteers to go to Korea to fight alongside the Korean People's Army. This is precisely to strike and stop the aggression of US imperialism. As long as the US imperialists persist in the war of aggression against Korea for one day, the entire Chinese people will never stop continuing to give them heavy blows. On the other hand, the situation of the US imperialists is exactly the opposite of ours. They are not only invading Korea and China, but also preparing to use aggressive wars to shed blood on all of Asia and the world. However, the heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people's troops in Korea has forced them to trap most of the main force of their army in Korea, so that they cannot only proceed with their plans to expand the military and prepare for a world war as they wish, and cannot launch aggressive wars in other parts of the world as they wish, but even encounter great difficulties in supplementing the Korean battlefield. Obviously, the US imperialists' aggression in Korea has not "contained" anyone, but only contained themselves.

In fact, the US's so-called tactics of "containment" and "depletion" are used to deceive the American people because their tactics of delaying negotiations are unpopular. The American people are unwilling to support the US imperialists' war of aggression, and therefore are even more dissatisfied with their delaying negotiations to prolong the war. This is something that even the reactionary American newspapers cannot conceal. The New York Post on October 2nd opposed the US government "delaying negotiations" on some "procedural and formal issues" and "ambiguous issues of changing addresses." The US imperialists know that their so-called "containment" and "depletion" are not enough to quell the people's opposition, so they are trying hard to pull other countries into bearing this responsibility. They first slandered and attempted to shirk the responsibility for delaying negotiations to the Chinese and Korean sides, and now they are provocatively attempting to push this responsibility to the Soviet Union, even at the expense of using so-called "bad consequences" and "adverse effects" to carry out threats. However, the US's atomic blackmail policy has already been shattered by Comrade Stalin's talk about the atomic bomb. Their attempt to shirk responsibility has also suffered a serious blow from the statement issued by the Soviet government on October 18th. Therefore, as long as the US imperialists do not abandon their delaying tactics, they cannot but fall into the difficulties they have created themselves.

We fully agree with the Soviet government's statement on the Korean situation and Soviet-American relations. We believe that as long as the US government still has the slightest sincerity in resolving the Korean armistice issue, they should immediately instruct General Ridgway to stop the delaying tactics he has adopted in the armistice negotiations, so that the Korean armistice negotiations can be quickly concluded on a fair and reasonable basis, which was originally entirely possible, and there were originally no insurmountable difficulties. Otherwise, all their deceptive talk about "solving international problems" and "easing tensions" will only further increase the Chinese people's determination to fight US imperialism in Korea for a long time until they achieve their goals.

### 苏联的严正立场和美国的拖延战术

    苏联的严正立场和美国的拖延战术
    本月十八日苏联发表了苏联政府关于朝鲜局势与苏美关系致美国政府的声明。声明指出在朝鲜所发生的局势是由于美国有计划地拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，而停战谈判的遭受延岩又是由于朝鲜美英司令部有步骤地造成各种障碍来妨碍谈判的顺利进展。苏联政府在如此地击破了美帝国主义者企图卸脱其拖延停战谈判的责任的阴谋之后，跟着指出如果美国政府真正主张改善苏美关系，它已经有不少机会可以行动来证明它的和平意愿，但是美国政府并没有这样去做。这就证明美国事实上不是要改善苏美关系并与苏联合作的。声明最后强调说，苏联政府同意在美国政府的参加之下，审查一切尚未解决的重要问题，并讨论改善国际关系——包括苏美关系的办法。
    苏联政府的声明，再度证明了苏联伟大的不可动摇的和平意愿的坚强性。它粉碎了美国驻苏大使寇克代表美国政府所采取的挑衅行动，揭穿了美帝国主义者拖延朝鲜谈判又企图推卸责任的卑鄙阴谋。它对于全力反抗美国的血腥侵略的中国人民、朝鲜人民以及一切同情我们这个斗争的全世界人民是一个鼓舞。
    大家知道，由于中国志愿军与朝鲜人民军坚强不断的打击，美国帝国主义者在朝鲜战争中遭受了重大的困难，军队的大量被歼灭，军备的巨大消耗，人民的不肯支持，帝国主义阵营的争吵与踌躇不前，这一切不但打乱了它准备世界战争的时间表，甚至以武力征服朝鲜的梦想都因为碰到了铁的事实而不能不多所顾虑。但是另一方面，停战谈和对于它的长期紧张的备战政策以及外交内政方面的目的显然又是不利的。因此它虽然一面接受了苏联驻联合国代表马立克的建议来开始停战谈判，但是在谈判的进程之中，尽管朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军谈判代表团无时不采取严正负责的态度来对待谈判和谈判中可能发生的事件，美帝国主义者却不断制造各种破坏事件，采取各种不同的阻挠办法，借口各种枝节问题来使谈判复杂化，并使之拖延下去，以致谈判停顿了近两个月之久还不能恢复。这就是美帝国主义者遭逢了在朝鲜战又困难、停又不愿的矛盾局势之后所采取的拖延战术。
    愚蠢的美帝国主义者妄图以这种拖延战术来边打边谈，保持紧张，以便“牵制”和“消耗”我国的兵力，但是事实证明被“牵制”被“消耗”的不是我们，正是他们自己。根据去年十月二十五日到今年十月十五日的统计，美国侵略军的伤亡率是正在逐日大量增加的。从去年十月二十五日至今年五月二十一日的二百零九天中，美军平均每天损失兵员八百八十五人。但是到了他们所谓的“夏季攻势”，即自今年五月二十二日至九月二十四日的一百二十六天中美国侵略军的伤亡即已增加至每天一千二百九十一人，这较之以前七个月不到的损失增加了百分之四十以上。等到他们的所谓“秋季攻势”到来之后，他们的损失更是跳跃的增加。从十月一日起至十月十日的十天中，美国侵略军平均每天要损失二千五百四十余人。而在十月十三日至十月十五日的三天之中，美军每天平均的损失则为这个数目的两倍以上，三天之中，每天要伤亡五千六百六十六人。这证明美帝国主义者以拖延谈判，边打边谈来减少消耗的希望是得到了相反的结果，最近美军的损失是在更迅速地增加着。这样，到底是谁消耗了谁呢？至于美国所谓的“牵制”我们，更是毫无根据的妄想。我国不是侵略国家，我们决不要侵略任何人，但是我们也决不容许任何人侵略我国。由于美帝国主义者发动侵朝战争，并将他的侵略魔掌伸进了中国，中国人民忍无可忍，才组织自己的志愿军去朝鲜与朝鲜人民军并肩作战。这正是为了打击和制止美帝国主义的侵略。只要美帝国主义一日坚持侵朝战争，全中国人民就决不停止继续给他们以深重的打击。另一方面，美帝国主义者的情形却恰恰和我们相反。他们不但是正在侵略朝鲜，侵略中国，他并且在准备用侵略战争血洗全亚洲和全世界。然而中朝人民的部队在朝鲜的英勇斗争已经使他们不得不把他们的军队的主力的大部分陷在朝鲜，使他们不但不能如意进行其准备世界战争的扩军计划，不能如意地再在世界其他地区发动侵略战争，甚至连朝鲜战场上的补充都遇到很大的困难。显然地，美帝国主义者在朝鲜的侵略并没有“牵制”住任何人，而只是牵制了他们自己。
    事实上，美国所谓的“牵制”与“消耗”的战术是为了其拖延谈判的战术之不得人心而用以欺骗美国人民的。美国人民对于美国帝国主义的侵略战争不愿支持，因此对于他们拖延谈判来延长战争更不满意。这一点是美国反动报纸都不能隐讳的。十月二日的纽约邮报就反对美国政府在一些“程序和手续问题”以及“更换地址的暧昧问题”上“延宕谈判”。美帝国主义者深知其所谓的“牵制”和“消耗”不足以平息人民的反对，于是努力企图拉扯其他国家来担负这个责任。他们始而矢口诬蔑，企图将拖延谈判的责任卸给中朝方面，现在又挑衅式地企图将这个责任推给苏联，甚至不惜以所谓“不良的后果”，“恶劣的影响”来施行威胁。然而美国的原子讹诈政策已经是被斯大林同志关于原子弹的谈话所粉碎了。他们推卸责任的企图又遭受了苏联政府十月十八日所发表的声明的严重的打击。因此，只要美帝国主义者不放弃他们的拖延战术，他们就不能不陷入他们自己所造成的困难中。
    我们完全同意苏联政府关于朝鲜局势与苏美关系的声明。我们认为，只要美国政府尚有丝毫解决朝鲜停战问题的诚意，他们就应该立即训令李奇微将军停止他在停战谈判方面所采取的拖延战术，使朝鲜停战谈判得以迅速在公平合理的基础上达成协议，而这本来是完全可能的，本来是没有不可克服的困难的。否则，他们一切所谓“解决国际问题”“和缓紧张形势”的欺人之谈，就只有更增加中国人民在朝鲜与美帝国主义长期斗争不达到目的不止的决心。
