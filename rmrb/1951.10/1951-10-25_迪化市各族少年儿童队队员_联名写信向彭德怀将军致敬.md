Children of All Ethnic Groups in Dihua City
Jointly Write a Letter to Salute General Peng Dehuai

    On the eve of the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight, three members of the Young Pioneers from Dihua City, representing the Uyghur, Kazakh, and Han ethnic groups, including Maimaiti, who had just returned from the children's summer camp in Beijing, jointly wrote a letter of condolence to General Peng Dehuai, commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front. The letter is as follows:

    Respected Commander Peng: You have been leading the heroic Volunteer Army uncles and aunties in fighting the American devils in Korea for almost a year. We respectfully wish you good health and wish our dear Volunteer Army uncles, aunties, good health!

    This July, we three little ones: Maimaiti (Uyghur), Le Xijiang (Kazakh), and Chen Lanfang (Han) were honorably selected as the Xinjiang representatives of the Northwest Summer Travel Team of the Chinese Young Pioneers and went to the capital we often think about—Beijing. At the train station, the children of Beijing vied to carry us on their shoulders, happily shouting "Welcome Xinjiang children!" In the joyful summer camp life, we and the children's representatives from various places, held hands every day, singing and dancing in the woods, exchanging commemorative badges, and leaving many encouraging words in our diaries: "Strive to be a good child of the Mao Zedong era."

    In Beijing, we invited Uncle Li Jitao, a returned representative of the Volunteer Army, to hold a get-together. Uncle Li said: "For the motherland, for you children, we are willing to sacrifice everything." He also reported many facts about the American army's crimes of killing Korean children. Therefore, we thought: If it weren't for the heroic Volunteer Army uncles, under your wise command, fighting the American aggressors, would we have such a happy life today?

    Uncle Peng, children of all ethnic groups in Dihua city actively participated in the peace signature campaign and the voting against American imperialism's rearmament of Japan. Primary school students in seventeen primary schools throughout the city, like the adults, have all established patriotic covenants. The phenomenon of absenteeism and fighting has been greatly reduced. Children of all ethnic groups like to sing aloud "Stately and full of spirit, crossing the Yalu River..." in their respective languages ​​in schools, streets, and homes.

    After the Volunteer Army returned representatives reported in Dihua, the children enthusiastically wrote letters of condolence to the Volunteer Army uncles and used their spare time to collect waste paper and make toys, sell them, and donate the money for airplanes and cannons. Twelve-year-old Uyghur child Abudurehaben even signed up to go to Korea.

    Uncle Peng, we remember that you came to Dihua after the liberation of the Great Northwest; we hope that you will come to Dihua again when you return victoriously to the country, let us see you and embrace you. Please tell all the Volunteer Army uncles, aunties, that on the eve of this great anniversary, the children of all ethnic groups in the northwestern frontier of the motherland salute you, and we are all working hard to learn from your heroic example. We hope you will strike the American aggressors even harder!

    迪化市各族少年儿童队队员
    联名写信向彭德怀将军致敬
    中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年前夕，刚从北京参加儿童夏令营回来的迪化市维吾尔族、哈萨克族和汉族的三个少年儿童队队员买卖提等，联名写慰问信给朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军。信如下：
    敬爱的彭司令员：您带着英雄的志愿军伯伯叔叔，在朝鲜抗击美国鬼子快要一周年了。我们敬祝您身体健康，敬祝亲爱的志愿军伯伯、叔叔、阿姨们健康！
    今年七月，我们三个小宝宝：买卖提（维吾尔族）、雷西江（哈萨克族）、陈兰芳（汉族）光荣地当了中国少年儿童队西北夏季旅行队的新疆代表，到了心里经常想念的首都——北京。在车站上，北京市的儿童争着把我们扛在背膀上，高兴地喊着“欢迎新疆小朋友”！在快乐的夏令营生活中，我们和各地的儿童代表，每天手拉着手，在树林里唱歌跳舞，交换纪念章，在日记本上互相留下好多鼓励的话：“努力做个毛泽东时代的好儿童。”
    在北京，我们请了志愿军归国代表李激涛叔叔开了联欢会。李叔叔说：“为了祖国，为了你们儿童，我们愿牺牲自己的一切。”他还报告了许多关于美军残杀朝鲜儿童的罪恶事实。因此，我们就想到：如果不是英雄的志愿军伯伯叔叔在您英明指挥下打击了美国侵略者，我们今天会有这样快乐的生活吗？
    彭伯伯，迪化市各民族的儿童积极地参加了和平签名和反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的投票。全市十七个小学校的小学生，他们和大人们一样，都订立了爱国公约。从前旷课、打架的现象现在已经大大地减少了。各民族的小朋友在学校、街头、家庭都喜欢用各自的语言大声歌唱“雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江……”
    志愿军归国代表在迪化报告后，儿童们热烈地给志愿军伯伯叔叔们写慰问信，并利用课余时间，拣拾废纸做成玩具，卖了钱，捐献飞机大炮。十二岁的维族儿童阿不都热哈本，还报名要求到朝鲜去哩。
    彭伯伯，我们记得在大西北解放后您曾经到迪化来过；希望你胜利归国时再到迪化来，让我们看看您，拥抱您。请您转告全体志愿军伯伯、叔叔和阿姨们，在这伟大的纪念日前夕，祖国西北边疆的各民族儿童向您们致敬，我们都在努力学习您们的英雄榜样。希望您们更狠地打击美国侵略者！
