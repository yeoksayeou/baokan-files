The workers and peasants of Northeast China, in the past year of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, enthusiastically launched a patriotic labor emulation movement, laying a solid material foundation for consolidating the national defense of the motherland.

    Shortly after the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement last winter, workers and staff of factories and mines in Northeast China responded one after another to the challenge from advanced producer Zhao Guoyou's workshop, launching a vigorous patriotic labor emulation campaign. This was a powerful guarantee for the over-fulfillment of the annual plan for state-owned industrial production in Northeast China by 11.6% in 1950. In January of this year, the movement of Northeast workers learning from and responding to the Ma Hengchang Group made labor emulation more widespread and in-depth than before. According to incomplete statistics at the end of the first quarter, the number of workers participating in the competition throughout the region increased from 700,000 at the end of last year to more than 1.2 million; and more than 6,600 Ma Hengchang-style advanced production groups emerged. In the second half of this year, the labor emulation movement of workers in Northeast China has undergone a very important development, which is the widespread launch of the production increase and economy practice movement, with the main content of giving full play to industrial potential, as called for by Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government. According to current statistics of production increase and economy practice plans in various places, state-owned and public-owned factories and mines throughout the region can create wealth equivalent to more than 10 million tons of grain for the country on the basis of the original production plan. As of August, the state-owned industrial system alone had completed the task of increasing production and practicing economy worth 4,267,700 tons of grain. In this movement, the workers gave full play to their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, actively thought of ways and found tricks to greatly exploit industrial potential. For example, the employees of Rubber Factory No. 4 put forward many rationalization proposals in the three months from July to September, of which 30 have been adopted by the administration. The factory expects to increase production and economize on wealth equivalent to 60,000 tons of grain by the end of the year.

    In the countryside, farmers in Northeast China, under the leadership of the well-known labor model Han En and his mutual aid team, launched a large-scale sideline production competition last winter, preparing conditions for this year's large-scale production. This spring, farmers in Northeast China responded to the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team in Shanxi Province and widely launched a patriotic bumper harvest competition movement. There are about 120,000 mutual aid teams participating in the competition in Northeast China. Encouraged by the bumper harvest movement, the peasants’ production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. They overcame various natural disasters such as drought, flood, and insects since the spring plowing, and completed the spring plowing and summer hoeing plan in a timely manner. The planting area of ​​industrial raw material crops such as cotton and flax, as well as soybeans and wheat, exceeded the original plan. The farming techniques in various parts of Northeast China have also generally improved compared with previous years. More than 80% of farmers have carried out seed disinfection and germination test work. The amount of fertilizer applied in various places has also increased by 10% compared with last year.

    After the start of summer hoeing, farmers in Northeast China generally revised their production increase and donation plans on the basis of the original bumper harvest plan in response to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association. This year, farmers in various places generally hoeed and cultivated major crops such as soybeans and sorghum three or four times, and cotton was generally hoeed and cultivated five times, and some were hoeed and cultivated eight or nine times. In order to ensure increased production, farmers in various places also widely adopted the method of topdressing green seedlings, which is an innovation in many parts of Northeast China. At present, farmers in various places are enthusiastically launching the autumn harvest production competition of "cut as you harvest, pull as you harvest" and "careful harvest, careful beating," and are actively completing the payment plan for donating airplanes and artillery.

    一年来东北工人农民的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动
    东北工人和农民在一年来抗美援朝运动中，热烈展开爱国主义的劳动竞赛，为巩固祖国国防奠定了雄厚的物质基础。
    在去冬抗美援朝运动展开不久，东北各厂、矿职工即纷纷响应先进生产者赵国有所在车间的挑战，展开了轰轰烈烈的爱国主义劳动竞赛。这是一九五零年东北国营工业生产上超额百分之十一点六完成了全年计划的有力保证。今年一月，东北职工向马恒昌小组学习和应战的运动使劳动竞赛比以前更为广泛与深入。据第一季度末不完全统计，全区参加竞赛的职工已由去年年底的七十万人增加到一百二十余万人；并涌现了六千六百多个马恒昌式的先进生产小组。在今年下半年，东北工人的劳动竞赛运动又有了极重要的发展，这就是东北人民政府高岗主席所号召的以发挥工业潜在力为主要内容的增产节约运动的普遍展开。根据目前各地增产节约计划统计：全区国营及公营厂矿在原有生产计划的基础上可多为国家创造价值等于一千余万吨粮食的财富。到八月份为止，仅国营工业系统，即已完成价值等于四百二十六万七千余吨粮食的增产节约任务。在这一运动中，工人们发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，积极想办法、找窍门，使工业的潜在能力得到很大的发挥。如橡胶第四厂的职工，在七月至九月的三个月中，就提出了许多合理化建议，其中三十件已被行政采用。该厂预计到年底能增产节约价值等于六万吨粮食的财富。
    在农村中，东北各地农民在著名劳动模范韩恩及其互助组的带头推动下，于去冬即已开展了大规模的副业生产竞赛，为今年的大生产准备了条件。今年春季，东北农民又纷纷响应山西省李顺达互助组的挑战，广泛展开了爱国丰产竞赛运动。东北全区参加竞赛的互助组共有十二万个左右。农民们在丰产运动的鼓舞下，生产热情空前高涨，战胜了自春耕以来旱、涝、虫等各种自然灾害，及时完成了春耕夏锄计划；棉、麻等工业原料作物和大豆、小麦的种植面积，均超过了原订计划。东北各地的耕作技术也普遍较往年提高。百分之八十以上的农户都进行了种籽消毒和发芽试种的工作。各地的施肥量也比去年增加百分之十。
    在夏锄开始后，东北各地农民为响应抗美援朝总会号召，普遍在原有丰产计划的基础上增订了增产捐献计划。今年各地农民对大豆、高粱等主要农作物一般均铲趟三、四遍，对棉花则普遍做到五铲五趟，有的铲趟到八、九遍。为保证增产，各地农民还广泛采用青苗追肥办法，这在东北很多地方都是创举。目前，各地农民正热烈展开“随割、随拉”、“细收、细打”的秋收生产竞赛，并积极完成捐献飞机大炮的缴款计划。（新华社）
