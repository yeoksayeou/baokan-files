    Oppose Blindness in Work
    Blindness in work is a great threat to the interests of the state.
    In order to solve the disaster problem, the Yanggao County People's Government of Chahar Province organized the masses to burn bricks from May of this year. As of early August, the county had restored and developed more than ten state-owned and private brick kilns. The Coal Industry Equipment Construction Company, without understanding the specifications and quality of the bricks, signed a contract with these kilns to order more than three million blue bricks. However, most of the bricks produced by these kilns did not meet the specifications and could not be used. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has instructed them to stop the allocation. The relevant units in Yanggao County have also held meetings for inspection and formulated specific improvement measures.
    The Yanggao County People's Government's organization of the masses to burn bricks, which can both solve the disaster problem and increase material strength for national construction, was originally a good motive. However, the Yanggao County People's Government blindly carried out its work, without paying attention to the specifications of the bricks burned, thus damaging the interests of the state, which is completely wrong. Any agency or cadre should correct this phenomenon of only seeing the interests of their own unit or region and blindly carrying out work, otherwise, no matter what your subjective intention is, the result will inevitably damage the interests of the state, and therefore it is also a mistake.

    反对工作中的盲目性
    工作中的盲目性，对于国家利益是很大的威胁。
    察哈尔省阳高县人民政府为了解决灾荒问题，从今年五月起，组织群众烧砖；到八月上旬为止，该县已经恢复和发展了公营和私营窑厂十多家。煤业器材建筑公司没有了解砖的规格和质量，就和这些窑厂签订了订购三百多万块青砖的合同。但是，这些窑厂烧出来的砖，大都不合规格，都不能使用。政务院财政经济委员会已指示他们停止调拨。阳高县各有关单位也已开会作了检查，并制定了具体的改进办法。
    阳高县人民政府组织群众烧砖，既可解决灾荒问题，又可为国家建设增加物质力量，动机本来是好的。但是，阳高县人民政府却盲目地进行工作，不注意烧出的砖的规格，因而损害了国家的利益，这就完全错了。任何机关或干部，都应该纠正这种只看到自己单位或地区的利益，而盲目进行工作的现象，否则，不管你主观意图如何，其结果必然损害国家利益，因而也是一种错误。
