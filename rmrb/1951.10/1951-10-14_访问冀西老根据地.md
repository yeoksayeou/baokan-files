Visiting the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Western Hebei
    Zeng Wenjing

    Heroic People
    The Jin-Cha-Ji Sub-delegation of the Central People's Government's Northern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Group began its visit to the western mountainous areas of Hebei Province (the North Yue District of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region during the Anti-Japanese War) on July 13th.

    During the Anti-Japanese War, this was behind enemy lines, a battlefield that had experienced countless cruel struggles. Japanese fascist bandits "mopped-up" this mountainous area year after year, implementing the "Three Alls Policy," trying frantically to kill all the people, burn all the houses, and loot all the property. However, the people of Western Hebei never yielded. They bravely resisted for eight years, and Western Hebei stood firm like a wall of bronze and iron, forever an invincible fortress.

    During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, how many heroes and heroines emerged from the masses of Western Hebei! The Five Warriors of Langya Mountain, who fought to their last drop of blood; the sharpshooter Li Dianbing, who never missed a shot; Hao Qingshan, who appeared and disappeared in enemy strongholds to hunt down enemy puppets, traitors, and special agents; the Wuzhangwan guerrilla group, who laid out minefields; Zhang Shuyi, a disabled veteran who crawled to scout enemy positions and persisted in production; Rong Guanshou, the "Mother of the Soldiers"… They all made indelible contributions to the revolutionary cause, and to this day, people still use poetry, novels, dramas, and other forms of art to depict and praise them. However, the heroic resistance of the people of Western Hebei has always been a mass, collective undertaking. Those tens of thousands of militiamen who constantly attacked the enemy, the stretcher bearers who rushed to rescue the wounded on the battlefield, the women who sewed military shoes day and night, the farmers who actively produced and donated public grain, the Young Pioneers who stood guard and kept watch… They did their utmost for the war of resistance, made significant contributions to the revolutionary cause, and deserved to be called heroic people. They have an excellent revolutionary tradition, and in the future, they will strive for even more glory!

    Quyang Stonemasons Offer Jade Fruit

    On the first night the visiting group entered Western Hebei, Chief Cheng Zihua was talking with everyone under the lamp when suddenly several people in coarse cloth shirts ran in. With voices trembling with excitement, they said, "We are workers from Yangping Village, Quyang County. We were liberated under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Today, when we heard that the Central People's Government had sent a visiting group here, we specially ran more than twenty *li* back to the village to bring the many jade fruits we carved ourselves, and we ask you to take them to Beijing and give them to Chairman Mao." Everyone opened the tray of gifts and exclaimed, "Oh, what delicious-looking fruits!" Peaches, pears, apples, grapes, bitter melons… arranged on the table, they looked as if they had just been picked from the trees. How superb is the artistic talent of the people! And how much they love and respect their leader!

    These fruits are carved from white marble, which is produced in Huangshi Mountain, more than twenty *li* from Quyang city. The people in that area are endlessly grateful to the Chinese Communist Party. During the difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the assistance of the People's Government, they built a large canal that stretched for fifty-four *li*. This canal irrigated 70,000 *mu* of land, so that the people in this area no longer worried about drought or flood, and they had a good harvest every year. The stonemasons near Huangshi Mountain, who all work and cultivate on this fertile land, especially love and respect Chairman Mao, and it is by no means accidental.

    Roaring at the Thousand-Person Tomb

    On July 14th, a part of our visiting group braved the wind and rain and walked thirty *li* of mountain road to Pingyang Village, Fuping County, to console the families of the compatriots who died in the "Pingyang Massacre." The "Pingyang Massacre" was one of the towering crimes committed by Japanese imperialism in China. In the autumn of 1943, Japanese imperialism concentrated more than 40,000 troops to carry out a three-month "encirclement and suppression mop-up" of the North Yue District (then a part of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, including western Hebei, northeastern Shanxi, etc.). The Arai unit of the Japanese army searched out local people in the mountain gullies near Pingyang Village and beat them to death, burned them to death, boiled them to death, or machine-gunned them. They cut open the bellies of pregnant women and used bayonets to stab out premature fetuses; they beheaded Liu Yaomei, the director of the Women's National Salvation Association of Luoyao Village, and cut meat from her legs to make dumplings. They killed about a thousand people in Pingyang, creating a blood feud. Now, on the hillside behind Pingyang Village, there is a white stone tombstone six or seven *chi* high and more than one *chi* wide, inscribed with the three large characters "Thousand-Person Tomb," with a description of the massacre engraved below, and the names of the massacred compatriots engraved on the back of the stele. To the left of the "Thousand-Person Tomb" is the tomb of a female Communist Party member. This female party member was named Lin Chao, and she had worked as a female worker in Taiyuan. After the Anti-Japanese War, she went to the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region to do women's work. She was captured by the enemy during the mop-up and died heroically.

    Although the imperialist invading army was extremely fierce and cruel, the people cannot be killed off, the houses cannot be burned out, and imperialism is doomed to failure. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the people of Pingyang Village have had the opportunity to recuperate and rebuild. Many new houses have been built on the ruins burned by the enemy, and the total population of the village is now larger than during the Anti-Japanese War.

    The people of Pingyang Village will forever hate imperialism. When the visiting group representatives paid their respects at the "Thousand-Person Tomb," and when they mentioned that U.S. imperialism had released Japanese war criminals, concluded a separate peace treaty with Japan, and rearmed Japan, the masses of the whole village angrily shouted: "Even if the Japanese war criminals run to the ends of the earth, they must be caught and severely punished in the future! We must actively assist the Chinese People's Volunteers and do a good job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defeat the American aggressor troops!"

    Fuping – The Heart of the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area

    On July 15th, the visiting group arrived in Fuping County. Fuping is a glorious mountain city. In 1931, the Twenty-Fourth Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army came to this place, and the people of Fuping once established a red regime. In December 1937, the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region was held in Fuping County, and the Administrative Committee of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region was elected as the highest leading body of the anti-Japanese democratic regime in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, the leading organs of the Party, government, army, and civilians of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region were mostly located in Shijiazhuang Chengnanzhuang and other places within the territory of Fuping.

    During the entire Anti-Japanese War, the entire territory of Fuping was under the control of our anti-Japanese regime. The people of Fuping are not only very brave, but also very hardworking.

    Within Fuping County, there are either bare barren mountains or vast sandy beaches. The total cultivated land only accounts for 2% of the county's land area, with an average of only four *fen* of irrigable water land and eight *fen* of dry land per person. The terraced fields in the gullies were all made by transporting soil to the mountains basket by basket with donkeys. The millet on the mountain is only a *chi* tall, and one *mu* of land can only produce one *dou* per year. The local people have to mix chaff, red dates, and leaves to make a living. So people say: "Fuping has three treasures: rice bran, leaves, and red dates." "Half of the crops in the mountains grow on trees."

    Since Fuping established an anti-Japanese democratic regime, the people of Fuping, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have begun to organize and fight stubbornly against nature. In the autumn of 1939, the Shahe River flooded, washing away the cultivated land on both the north and south banks. The Peasant Association called on everyone to organize and repair the beach land, and the Training Corps of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region also actively helped the masses repair the beach land. At that time, all the grain was eaten, and everyone ate leaves to repair the beach land. Later, the People's Government mobilized a portion of red dates from the people in the enemy-occupied areas and distributed them to the Beach Land Repair Committee. Each person could only eat forty dates a day, but the people of Fuping were the most hardworking and hardworking, and in that year they repaired eighty *li* of beach land. After that, although the enemy repeatedly "mopped up" Fuping, burning, killing, looting and plundering everywhere, the People's Government implemented rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform, and took various measures to help the people of Fuping develop production. The people of Fuping began to get rid of the past situation of "bran vegetables for half a year." They happily said: "Master Yang should take a nap!" (This means: no longer eat the leaves of poplar trees)

    However, since 1948, there have been continuous droughts, floods, windstorms, hailstorms, and insect plagues, and the lives of the people of Fuping have continued to decline. However, the people of Fuping have rich experience in overcoming famine, and even in the most difficult situations, they must rely on their hands to obtain the minimum conditions of life.

    In January of this year, the Central People's Government sent Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the People's Government of Hebei Province, to inspect the mountainous area of ​​Western Hebei. He pointed out the direction of production development for Fuping, and at the same time allocated 1.9 billion yuan in winter clothing relief funds, 1.5 billion yuan in loans, and 220,000 *jin* of relief grain to Fuping. This not only enabled more than 20,000 disaster victims in Fuping to safely survive the spring famine, but also greatly helped the long-term production and construction of Fuping. These funds have been used by farmers to purchase 907 draught animals, 12,199 sheep, and 405 pigs, as well as farm implements and seeds. Up to now, the number of sheep raised has increased from 50,000 last year to 77,200. And due to the increase in livestock, the amount of fertilizer applied to the land has reached 60 *dan* per *mu*, restoring to the pre-war level. The second is to build 31 beach protection projects, tidy up 4,100 *mu* of terraced fields, build 16 large and small canals, and drill wells and purchase waterwheels. In addition, loans for flue-cured tobacco were issued, tobacco curing rooms were built, and sprayers and insecticides were lent out. Although the people of Fuping are still facing difficulties at present, all these measures have indeed added a new look to the construction of Fuping, and are a powerful guarantee for the future life of the people of Fuping. The people of Fuping all know that Chairman Mao is very concerned about them. They said: "Chairman Mao treats people well, buying donkeys and horses and sheep!" They also said: "If we don't work hard to produce, we will be sorry for Chairman Mao's concern for us."

    Xibaipo – One of the Residences of the CPC Central Committee

    With admiration, the visiting group traveled four days on mountain roads from Fuping County to Xibaipo Village in Jianping County to visit the former site of the CPC Central Committee in the later period of the Liberation War.

    Xibaipo is a place of historical significance. In 1947, after Hu Zongnan's reactionary army invaded Yan'an, Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Ren Bishi, and others remained in northern Shaanxi, and Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhu De, and others first brought a part of the personnel of the Central Committee to North China and lived in Xibaipo. In September of the same year, the National Land Conference was held here, and the draft of the Land Law Outline of China was adopted. In the spring of 1948, Chairman Mao and other responsible comrades of the CPC Central Committee also came to Xibaipo. The CPC Central Committee officially worked here. Chairman Mao commanded the Liaoshen, Pingjin, and Huaihai campaigns here. The victory of these three major battles made the victory of the Chinese people's revolution a foregone conclusion. In February 1949, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held here, deciding to shift the focus of the revolution from the countryside to the city. Thus, a new and glorious page was opened in the history of the Chinese revolution.

    The scenery of Xibaipo is very beautiful. A horseshoe-shaped hillside surrounds the north, east, and west sides of the village. The south side of the village is a large area of ​​fertile land, most of which is planted with rice and reeds; in front of the rice fields is the Hutuo River, which flows day and night. Many cypress trees are planted on both sides of the hillside, and there are also some cultivated land planted with millet and corn. Various trees are densely planted in the middle and around the village, and flat-roofed houses with yellow soil walls often emerge from the lush trees. The environment is very quiet, and only the pleasant sound of birds is sent by the wind from time to time.

    At that time, the residences of Chairman Mao and other comrades of the Central Committee were very simple, and the interior furnishings were also very simple. In order to avoid the bombing of Kuomintang planes, the harassment of reactionary troops, and the sabotage of special agents and spies, the CPC Central Committee moved from northern Shaanxi to Xibaipo. At that time, it was a secret to the outside world. However, the people in the central area of ​​the base area generally knew that this was the highest agency for the people. The local people were moved by the tense and serious work style and amiable attitude of the personnel of this agency. After the liberation of Peiping, the CPC Central Committee moved to Peiping. The people in this area caused a sensation, and they all rushed to see where Chairman Mao and other central leaders lived. People from nearby villages also climbed mountains to see. They all said: "Chairman Mao lives here, it is really the greatest glory of the people of our Jianping County!"

    Forever Follow the Communist Party

    The visiting group conducted more than ten days of visits in Western Hebei and was warmly welcomed by the local people. Drums and gongs were blaring in every village, tea, melons, and fruits were prepared, and men, women, old and young lined up to cheer, and among these cheers, the most meaningful sentence was "Forever follow the Communist Party."

    The people (mainly farmers) in the old revolutionary base area shouted this sentence, which shows that they demand the permanent leadership of the working class party and the permanent consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. In the past, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people in the old revolutionary base area gained democracy and land, and they shared life and death with the Communist Party. Now that the whole country is liberated, the working class party - the Communist Party - is now fighting for the basic improvement of the national economic situation and for the industrialization of the country. All these are to lead the peasants to a more happy and prosperous road. This is the road that the farmers of the whole country, especially the farmers of the old revolutionary base area, who have a particularly deep feeling for the Communist Party and have a higher political consciousness, must take.

    The people in the mountainous area of ​​Western Hebei were severely ravaged by Japanese fascists in the past, and have suffered serious threats from drought in recent years. However, the People's Government of Hebei Province has solved some of the difficulties in the mountainous area of ​​Western Hebei, and has begun to lay some foundations for long-term construction in the future. We believe that as long as the people of Western Hebei forever follow the Communist Party, they will definitely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and strive for new and richer living conditions more quickly.

    访问冀西老根据地
    曾文经
    英雄的人民
    中央人民政府北方老根据地访问团晋察冀分团于七月十三日开始到河北省西部山区（这就是抗日战争时期晋察冀边区的北岳区）进行访问。
    在抗日战争期间，这里是在敌人的后方，是一个经历无数次残酷斗争的战场。日本法西斯强盗，曾经年年向这山地“扫荡”，实行“三光政策”，疯狂地想要把那里的人民杀光，把房子烧光，把财物抢光。可是，冀西人民是从来不屈服的，他们英勇地抵抗了八年，冀西永远像铜墙铁壁一般地屹立着，永远是一座不可战胜的堡垒。
    在八年抗战中，冀西人民群众中涌现出多少英雄豪杰！那战斗到最后一滴血的狼牙山五壮士，那百发百中的神枪手李殿冰，那出没敌人据点捕杀敌伪汉奸特务的郝庆山，那大摆地雷阵的五丈湾游击组，那双腿残废仍然匍匐着去侦察敌情和坚持生产的荣誉军人张树义，那“子弟兵的母亲”戎冠秀……他们对于革命事业，都曾建立了不可磨灭的功绩，至今人民还在用诗歌、小说、戏剧等各种艺术去描写和歌颂他们。可是，冀西人民的英勇抗战，向来就是群众性的集体事业。那些千千万万经常袭击敌人的民兵，在战场上奔忙着救护伤员的担架队员，日夜赶做军鞋的妇女，积极生产捐献公粮的农民，站岗放哨的儿童团员，……他们对抗战确实尽了最大的努力，他们对革命事业是有重大贡献的，他们不愧为英雄的人民。他们具有优良的革命传统，今后是还要争取更多的光荣的！
    曲阳石匠献玉果
    访问团进入冀西的第一天晚上，程子华团长正在和大家在灯下谈话，突然门外跑进几个穿着粗布短衫的人来。他们用感奋得颤动了的声调说：“我们是曲阳县阳平村的工人，我们是在毛主席领导下翻了身的。我们今天听说中央人民政府派访问团到这里来，便特地跑了二十几里路回村去，把自己用刀刻成的许多玉果带来，拜托你们带到北京去送给毛主席”。大家把托盘上的礼物打开一看，呀，多么鲜美的果品！桃子、梨子、苹果、葡萄、苦瓜……摆在桌上，简直像刚从树上摘下来似的。人民的艺术天才，是多么的高超！他们对于自己的领袖，又是多么的敬爱！
    这些果品是用汉白玉刻成的，汉白玉出产在离曲阳城二十余里的黄石山上。那一带的人民，对中国共产党是感谢不尽的。在抗战的艰苦岁月里，他们在共产党的领导和人民政府的扶助下，修成了一条长达五十四里的大渠。这道大渠灌溉了七万亩的土地，使这一带的人民，既不愁旱，也不愁涝，年年丰收。黄石山附近的石匠，都在这一片肥沃的土地上做工和耕作，他们特别敬爱毛主席，绝对不是偶然的。
    千人墓前的怒吼
    七月十四日，我们访问团的一部分，冒着风雨走三十里的山道到阜平县的平阳村去慰问“平阳惨案”死难同胞的家属。“平阳惨案”是日本帝国主义在中国造成的滔天罪行之一。一九四三年的秋天，日本帝国主义集中了四万余兵力，向北岳区（当时晋察冀边区的一部分，包括冀西、晋东北等地区）进行了三个月的“剿灭扫荡”，日寇荒井部队在平阳村附近山沟里把当地人民搜捕出来打死、烧死、煮死，或用机关枪扫射。他们把孕妇的肚子剖开，用刺刀挑出未足月的胎儿；他们把罗耀村妇女救国会主任刘耀梅砍了头，从她腿上割下肉来包饺子吃。他们在平阳杀死了一千人左右，造成了血海深仇。现在平阳村后的山坡上，建立有一个六、七尺高，一尺多宽的白石墓碑，上书“千人墓”三个大字，下面刻着惨案发生的经过，碑的背面刻着被惨杀同胞的名字。“千人墓”的左方，有一个女共产党员的坟墓。这个女党员叫做林超，曾在太原当过女工，抗战后到晋察冀边区做妇女工作，在那次扫荡中被敌人俘虏，英勇就义。
    帝国主义侵略军虽是极端的凶恶残暴，可是，人民是杀不绝，房子是烧不尽的，而帝国主义是注定要失败的。在抗战胜利以后，平阳村的人民已经得到休养生息的机会，在被敌寇焚毁的废墟上已经盖起了许多新房子，目前全村总人口，也比抗战期间增加了。
    平阳村的人民对于帝国主义永远是仇恨的。当访问团代表在“千人墓”前致哀时，一提起美帝国主义释放日本战犯，单独和日本媾和、重新武装日本时，全村群众都愤怒地高呼：“日本战犯那怕跑到天涯海角，将来一定要抓来严办！我们一定要积极援助中国人民志愿军，做好抗美援朝工作，打垮美国侵略军队！”
    阜平——晋察冀抗日根据地的心脏
    七月十五日，访问团到了阜平县城。阜平是一个光荣的山城。一九三一年，中国工农红军第二十四军开到此地，阜平人民曾一度建立了红色政权。一九三七年十二月，晋察冀边区各界人民代表会议在阜平县城召开，推选出晋察冀边区行政委员会，作为晋察冀边区抗日民主政权的最高领导机构。在抗日战争和解放战争的时期，晋察冀边区的党政军民的领导机关，也大都设在阜平境内史家寨城南庄等地。
    在整个抗日期间，阜平全境都是在我们抗日政权控制之下。阜平人民不仅非常英勇，而且是非常勤劳的。
    阜平县境内，不是濯濯的童山，就是浩浩的沙滩，全部耕地仅占全县土地面积百分之二，平均每人只占有可灌溉的水地四分、旱地八分。沟沟叉叉里的梯田，都是用毛驴把土壤一筐一筐地送到山上去垫成的。山上的谷子只有尺来高，一亩地一年只能产一斗。当地人民只好渗和着糠、红枣、树叶来过日子。所以人们这样传说：“阜平三种宝：米糠、树叶、大红枣。”“山里的庄稼，一半长在树上”。
    自从阜平建立起抗日民主政权以后，阜平人民便在共产党领导下，开始组织起来和自然作坚韧的斗争了。一九三九年秋天，沙河发大水，把南北岸的耕地都冲了。农会便号召大家组织起来修滩地，晋察冀军区教导团也积极帮助群众修滩。当时粮食都吃完了，大家都吃着树叶修滩地，后来人民政府从敌占区的人民中动员一部分红枣来，分配到修滩委员会。每天每人也只能吃到四十个枣子，然而，阜平人民是最勤苦耐劳的，就在这一年，他们竟把八十里的滩地修成了。在这以后，虽然敌人多次到阜平“扫荡”，到处烧杀抢掠，但由于人民政府实行了减租减息和土地改革，并采取种种方法来扶助阜平人民发展生产。阜平人民从那时起就开始摆脱了过去“糠菜半年粮”的苦况。他们高兴地说：“杨大人该歇晌了！”（这话的意思是：不再吃杨树的叶子了）
    可是，自从一九四八年后，连年发生了旱、涝、风、雹、虫灾，阜平人民的生活又不断下降了。然而，阜平人民是有丰富的度荒经验的，他们即使在最困难的情况下，也要凭着双手去获得生活的最低条件的。
    今年一月，中央人民政府派河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席到冀西山地视察，他给阜平指出了生产发展的方向，同时给阜平拨来了寒衣赈款十九亿元，贷款十五亿元，赈粮二十二万斤。这不仅使阜平二万多的灾民，安然度过了春荒，而且还对阜平的长期生产建设，有了很大的帮助。这些款项已经由农民用来购买耕畜九○七头，羊一二、一九九只，猪四○五口以及农具和种籽等。到了现在，养羊的成绩，已由去年的五万只，增到七七、二○○只。而由于牲畜的增加，土地的施肥量已达每亩六十担，恢复到抗战前的水平。其次是修建了护滩工程三十一处，整理梯田四千一百亩，修大小渠十六道以及打井、购买水车等。此外又发放烤烟贷款，建立烟叶烤房，贷出喷雾器和杀虫剂等。虽然眼前阜平人民仍有困难，但这一切措施确已使阜平的建设事业增添了一番新气象，而对今后阜平人民的生活更是一个有力的保证。阜平人民都知道毛主席是非常关怀他们的。他们说：“毛主席，待人强，又买驴马又买羊！”又说：“咱们不好好生产，就对不住毛主席对咱们的关心了。”
    西柏坡——中共中央驻地之一
    访问团带着敬慕的心情，走了四天山路，由阜平县城赶到建屏县西柏坡村去瞻仰中共中央在解放战争后期的所在地。
    西柏坡是富有历史意义的地方。一九四七年，胡宗南反动军队进犯延安以后，毛泽东同志、周恩来同志、任弼时同志等仍留在陕北，刘少奇同志、朱德同志等先带着中央机关一部分人员来到华北，就住在西柏坡。同年九月，在这里召开了全国土地会议，通过了中国土地法大纲的草案。一九四八年春天，毛主席和中共中央其他负责同志也都到了西柏坡。中共中央正式在这里办公。毛主席就在这里指挥了辽沈、平津、淮海等三大战役。这三大战役的胜利，使中国人民革命的胜利成了定局。一九四九年二月，在毛主席领导下，在这里召开了中国共产党第七届第二次中央全体会议，决定把革命重心由乡村转移到城市去。于是中国革命史揭开了新的光辉灿烂的一页。
    西柏坡的景致很幽美。一个马蹄形的山坡，环抱着村庄的北边、东边和西边。村庄的南边是一大片肥沃的田地，大部分种着稻子和苇子；稻田的前边便是日夜奔流的滹沱河。山坡两旁栽着许多柏树，也有一些种着谷子和棒子的耕地。村庄中间和四围，密密地种着各种树木，往往有黄土墙的平顶房子从葱茂的树丛中显露出来。环境是很清静的，只有悦人的鸟声不时顺风送来。
    那时候，毛主席和中央各同志的住所都很简陋，室内陈设也很简单。为了避免国民党飞机的轰炸、反动军队的骚扰、特务奸细的破坏，中共中央从陕北迁到西柏坡居住，当时对外是秘密的。但根据地中心区的人民，大体都知道这是为人民办事的最高机关。当地人民都为这机关人员的紧张严肃的作风，和蔼可亲的态度所感动。北平解放后，中共中央迁移到北平。这一带的人们轰动起来，都争先恐后去看看毛主席和其他中央负责人住的地方。邻近各村的人民，也爬山越岭来看。他们都说：“毛主席在这里住，真是咱们建屏县人民的最大光荣呀！”
    永远跟着共产党
    访问团在冀西进行了十多天的访问，备受当地人民的欢迎。村村锣鼓喧天，准备了茶水瓜果，男女老幼排成队列夹道欢呼，而在这些欢呼中，意味最深长的便是“永远跟着共产党”的一句话。
    老根据地的人民（主要是农民）喊着这句话，是说明他们要求工人阶级政党的永久领导，要求工农联盟的永远巩固。老根据地人民在过去由于共产党的领导，获得了民主，获得了土地，他们与共产党是同生死、共患难的。现在全国解放，工人阶级的政党——共产党现在是要为全国经济情况的基本好转而斗争，是要为国家工业化而斗争。这都是要把农民引向更加幸福的康庄大道。这是全国农民特别是和共产党有特别深厚感情的，具有更高政治觉悟的老根据地农民一定要走的道路。
    冀西山地的人民，过去曾被日本法西斯进行严重的摧残，近年来又遭受天旱的重大威胁。但河北省人民政府已经解决冀西山地的若干困难，并开始为今后长期建设打下一些基础。我们相信冀西人民只要永远跟着共产党，他们就一定能克服种种困难，一定能更快地争取新的富裕的生活条件的到来。
