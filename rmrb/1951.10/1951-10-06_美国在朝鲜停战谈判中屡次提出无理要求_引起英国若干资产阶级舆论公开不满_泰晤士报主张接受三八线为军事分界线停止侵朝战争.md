Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The fact that the U.S. side has repeatedly made unreasonable demands in the Korean armistice negotiations has aroused open dissatisfaction among the bourgeois public opinion in Britain, the main accomplice in the aggression against Korea. The London Times published an editorial on October 1, advocating accepting the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line to stop the war of aggression against Korea. The newspaper stated: "Accepting the 38th parallel as the dividing line is very reasonable." The newspaper also stated that the U.S. side "continues to fight on the battlefield and at the negotiating table for a few miles of land that it does not actually intend to keep in the future, which is somewhat incomprehensible." The newspaper advocated "immediately declaring its willingness to recognize the 38th parallel as the north-south dividing line and seek a political solution." The Times concluded by stating that the U.S. and Britain currently have only two paths: either continuing the war to occupy the entire Korea or having peace on the 38th parallel, and the first method has been rejected by the American people and other members of the United Nations.

Prior to this, some British bourgeois newspapers and periodicals had repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction and concern about the dangerous policy of the United States to undermine the armistice negotiations. The British "Economist" magazine, in response to the lies spread by the U.S. side that the Chinese and Korean sides had no sincerity for peace, said: "In recent weeks, there has been a definite fact, that is, the first action advocating an armistice did indeed come from the communists." The London Times' Hong Kong dispatch on September 21 stated: "There has never been any indication that the communists have abandoned their clear intention to demand a ceasefire." The British "Manchester Guardian" published an editorial on September 24 refuting the rumors spread by the United States that the Korean and Chinese sides were unwilling to negotiate an armistice, saying: "If their purpose at the beginning was mainly to gain time to reorganize and recuperate their troops, then they would no longer be interested in negotiations." The newspaper advised Ridgway not to "abandon negotiations" to avoid "paying the price of casualties." The newspaper said:
	"With the arrival of another Korean winter, that is a terrible prospect, although General Ridgway and General Van Fleet are optimistically looking forward to this prospect. There is no doubt that every opportunity for negotiation must be utilized."

    美国在朝鲜停战谈判中屡次提出无理要求
    引起英国若干资产阶级舆论公开不满
    泰晤士报主张接受三八线为军事分界线停止侵朝战争
    【新华社五日讯】美国方面在朝鲜停战谈判中屡次提出无理要求的事实，已引起了侵朝主要帮凶国家英国的资产阶级舆论的公开不满。伦敦泰晤士报于十月一日发表社论，主张接受三八线为军事分界线，停止侵朝战争。该报称：“接受三八线为分界线是很合理的。”该报又称：美国方面“继续在战场上和会议桌上，为了实际上以后并不打算保持的几哩土地而争斗，是有一些说不通的。”该报主张“立即宣布愿意承认三八线为南北分界线而谋求政治解决”。泰晤士报结语表示：美英目前只有两条道路，或者是为了占领整个朝鲜而继续战争，或者是在三八线上和平，而第一种办法已为美国人民与联合国其他会员国所拒绝了。
    在此以前，英国若干资产阶级报刊曾一再对美国破坏停战谈判的危险政策表示不满和担忧。英国“经济学家”周刊针对美方所散布的所谓中朝方面没有和平诚意的谰言说：“在最近几周中，有一个确定的事实，即主张停战的第一个行动确乎来自共产党。”伦敦泰晤士报九月二十一日的香港专电称：“从来没有任何迹象暗示共产党人曾经放弃他们要求停火的明显意图。”英国“曼彻斯特卫报”在九月二十四日发表社论反驳美国所散布的朝中方面不愿谈判停战的谣言说：“如果他们的目的起初就是以获得时间重整并养息他们的军队为主，那末他们就不会再对谈判感到兴趣了。”该报劝告李奇微不要“放弃谈判”，以免“付出死伤”。该报说：
    “随着另一个朝鲜冬季的到来，那是一个可怕的远景，虽然李奇微将军和范佛里特将军很乐观地瞻望这个远景。毫无疑问，每一个谈判的机会必须加以利用。”
