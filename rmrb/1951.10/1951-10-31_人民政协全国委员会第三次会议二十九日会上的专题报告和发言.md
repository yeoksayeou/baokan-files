The reports and speeches at the third plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on October 29 included those by Chen Yi, Du Ping, Li Shucheng, Zhang Yun, Li Shunda, Guo Shude, Bao Erhan, Cui Yuzhen, Wang Zhixi, Zhu Dehai, Xiong Kewu, and Li Dequan. Their reports and speeches are as follows:

**Speech by Chen Yi, Member of the East China Military and Political Committee**

**Seizing the Initiative in Ideological Leadership and Using Self-Criticism to Do a Good Job**

**Comrade Chairman Mao, Vice-Chairmen, Comrades, and Representatives:**

**1. Striving to Implement Chairman Mao's Instructions and the Decisions of the National Committee**

I represent the East China Administrative Region and Shanghai in fully agreeing with Chairman Mao's opening speech, fully agreeing with Premier Zhou's political report, fully agreeing with Vice-Chairman Chen Chutong's work report, Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen's report on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, Vice Premier Chen's economic and financial report, and Vice Premier Guo's cultural and educational report.

Chairman Mao's opening speech correctly proposes the policy of safeguarding peace, opposing aggression, and carrying out construction. It also points out that to continue the just struggle against aggression, the people of the entire country must continue the work of aiding Korea and resisting the U.S., increase production, and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea must continue until the U.S. government is willing to settle the issue peacefully. Premier Zhou's report and the reports of the other comrades are based on Chairman Mao's instructions and have explained and specifically stipulated the tasks for various items of work. I believe that Chairman Mao's instructions and the various reports fully conform to the domestic and international political situation and correctly express the great aspirations of the people of the entire country to oppose aggression, strive for peace, and yearn for construction. The people of East China are willing to strive to implement Chairman Mao's instructions and the decisions of the National Committee. Apart from continuing to complete land reform, thoroughly carry out the suppression of counterrevolutionaries, and continue to improve the Huai River, we must concentrate our efforts this winter and next year on the tasks of increasing production, practicing strict economy, and ideological remolding.

In the past year, work in various fields in East China has achieved rapid and great progress. I will briefly report on the work of East China and Shanghai to the conference:

**2. East China's Work in Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea**

The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has educated more than 80% of the people in East China in patriotism, basically eliminating the ideas of pro-Americanism, admiration for America, and fear of America, and promoting patriotism and internationalism. The entire region has 63 million people who signed the Stockholm Appeal; 159.93 million people signed and voted to support the conclusion of a peace pact and oppose the U.S. arming Japan; 700,000 children of workers and peasants joined the army; 240,000 students and young workers enthusiastically enrolled in military cadre schools; 46 million people participated in the May Day demonstration this year, with Shanghai having more than 2.4 million participants, accounting for about half of the city's population. Various regions have raised 67 billion yuan and a large number of clothes and letters to comfort Chinese and Korean soldiers and aid Korean refugees. Truck drivers, medical workers, and a large number of civilian workers have been organized to serve on the front lines in Korea in batches. By October 10, the people of East China had donated 897 aircraft, 33 cannons, 17 anti-aircraft guns, 3 tanks, accounting for one-third of the national donations; by October 20, East China had remitted 874 billion yuan, reaching 62% of the total pledged amount. The industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai and the broad masses of workers have jointly agreed to increase production and donate to national defense, originally pledging 40.5 billion yuan to buy 270 aircraft, and by October 26, it was reported that 43 billion yuan had been remitted, exceeding the original task. The donation movement is still continuing, aiming to reach 300 aircraft. Various places attach great importance to the work of caring for the families of soldiers and martyrs. Before and after August 1, extensive visits were conducted, and a thorough investigation was carried out to strengthen the regularity and mass nature of this work. The specific experience of East China's work in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is: first, wherever the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is listed as the center of political mobilization, organized and step-by-step efforts are made to carry it out, then all work is easiest to promote and can best arouse the initiative of the people. On the contrary, wherever the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is carried out in isolation or is regarded as a mere propaganda task, the promotion of various items of work will be very slow; second, in the past year, the victories on the front lines and the driving force in the rear have gradually convinced those who previously held doubts or opposition to the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, thus not only raising their ideological level but also promoting unity and strongly promoting work. Chairman Mao calls on us to continue the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and we fully accept this, preparing to further develop the patriotic movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in 1952.

**3. Land Reform in East China**

Land distribution has been completed in the four regions of Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, and Southern Anhui. In Zhejiang, 92% has been completed; in Fujian, 65% has been completed; in Northern Anhui, 50% has been completed. In the suburbs of Shanghai, land reform began in the spring of this year and will be completed by the end of this month. In total, 86.1% of the agricultural areas in East China, approximately 150 million agricultural population, have completed land distribution, and the remaining areas will be completed by next spring. During the land reform movement, various provinces (regions) and cities successively organized members of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and industrial and commercial circles to go to the countryside to observe or participate in the work. Shanghai and Southern Jiangsu jointly held a land reform exhibition, which was displayed in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other cities, making the urban population more clearly understand the crimes of feudal landlords and the just actions of the peasants, and correctly understand the significance of the land reform movement. The land reform in East China is not yet fully completed, so it is not yet time to summarize, but it can be pointed out that those who previously held doubts about land reform, predicted that land reform would disrupt social order, and did not believe that land reform would promote the development of industry and commerce, now see the great achievements of land reform and begin to change their erroneous views and attitudes. Just from this point, the practical educational significance of land reform is very great.

**4. Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries in East China**

During the "Open and Thorough Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries" movement, the people of East China enthusiastically exposed and denounced the crimes of counterrevolutionaries. Various local governments successively organized the registration of reactionary party, group, and spy members; after investigation and research and mastering materials, those counterrevolutionaries with serious crimes or continuing activities were arrested. The trial of counterrevolutionary cases is generally handled by the people's representative congresses, which organize counterrevolutionary case review committees or case cleanup committees to assist the public security and judicial organs in conducting the work carefully. After thorough cleanup, various places have executed those who committed serious crimes such as murder, robbery, arson, and rape, as well as notorious bandits, local tyrants with blood on their hands, responsible members of the Kuomintang spy organization with evidence, active counterrevolutionaries of reactionary parties and groups with evidence, and leaders of reactionary sects with evidence, while those counterrevolutionary criminals sentenced to imprisonment are being organized to undergo labor reform. Through this movement, the arrogance of counterrevolutionaries has been greatly reduced, the spirit of the people has been uplifted, the foundation of people's democratic dictatorship has been greatly strengthened, and social order has been greatly stabilized. In the past, Shanghai had many cases of robbery and theft, but this year, only three theft cases occurred in June, one in July, and none in August. We have carried out extensive bandit suppression work in the East China region. From the winter of 1949 to the end of June this year, a total of 223,187 bandits and spy armed forces were annihilated, and bandits on the mainland were basically eliminated. In the past, Fujian was plagued by bandits, but now the people live and work in peace, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. From the initial experience of suppressing counterrevolutionaries, it is proven that there are indeed many counterrevolutionaries hiding in various places; it is proven that the various activities of counterrevolutionaries are indeed very active; it is proven that it is necessary to suppress counterrevolutionary activities severely, and it is not permissible to hesitate or waver. Finally, the work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries has indeed been done correctly and powerfully. But it should be pointed out that counterrevolutionaries have not been completely eliminated, and we must continue to implement the work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries.

**5. Industrial and Commercial Situation in East China and the Living Standards of Workers and Peasants**

In the past year, the industrial and commercial situation in East China has greatly improved. The production enthusiasm and creativity of workers have been continuously enhanced, and a nationwide patriotic production competition has been launched, with production efficiency and output significantly increased. Taking the textile industry, which accounts for 70% of the national output, as an example, the monthly output of Shanghai's state-owned factories in the first half of this year compared to the highest level before liberation, yarn exceeded 16.9%, cloth exceeded 51.3%, and the production of steel, machinery, electrical appliances, tools, rubber, paper, cigarettes, matches, and other industries has also increased compared to last year. Many industrial raw materials, machinery, tools, and precision instruments that were previously not produced domestically have been newly created. Private industrial and commercial enterprises, under the guidance and help of the government, have generally shifted from recovery to development. From January to August this year, Shanghai approved the opening of 840 factories, with only 170 closing; approved the opening of 12,764 shops, with only 973 closing; after deducting the closures, a net increase of 12,461 shops was achieved. From February to June this year, various provinces (regions) and cities in East China, as well as more than 60% of prefectures and counties, held local product conferences and exhibitions. Shanghai held the East China Local Specialty Exhibition and Exchange Conference in June, which lasted for two months, with 3 million visitors, and the transaction amount reached 660 billion yuan, playing a significant role in the exchange of local products. Various industries have seen a phenomenon of no off-season and more prosperity during the peak season, and many industrial products are in short supply. The industrial and commercial situation is now trending towards greater improvement and prosperity.

Under the policy of relying on the working class, we have not only given full play to the great wisdom and strength of the working class but also primarily taken care of the interests of the working class. After the implementation of the labor insurance regulations, 1.4 million workers and their families in East China have benefited from labor insurance. The urban construction of Shanghai has clearly defined the policy of "serving production, serving the working people, and primarily serving the working class." In the areas where workers are most densely populated, such as the Tielan Bridge area in Hudong and the Shihuigou area in Huixi, the roads and sewerage projects have been significantly improved. In Pudong, a systematic plan has been made to build workers' housing and water and electricity projects. Other public buildings, public utilities, and cultural and educational hygiene projects have also achieved results in serving the working class.

For agricultural production, we have promulgated the ten major agricultural production policies, which have been implemented in various places, and have vigorously carried out water conservancy projects, drought relief, flood control, pest prevention, and disease control to overcome natural disasters and achieve a bumper harvest in the autumn of last year and this year. In 1950, the grain production in all of East China was approximately 82.5% of the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and this year, including the autumn harvest, it will reach more than 92.6% of the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The production of major industrial raw materials, such as cotton, is estimated to have increased by approximately 50% this year compared to 1950. The production of hemp, jute, flue-cured tobacco, and silkworm cocoons has also increased significantly. Under the personal initiative of Chairman Mao to "definitely improve the Huai River," we have, since last winter, mobilized a large number of cadres and more than 2 million civilian workers to vigorously improve the Huai River, which has been plagued by disasters for many years. This year, the first phase of the project was completed on schedule in July, successfully weathering the summer floods, and enabling the areas along the Huai River to achieve their first bumper harvest in a decade. After the land reform and bumper harvest, the living standards of the peasants have improved, and their production enthusiasm has been further enhanced. The slogan of "working hard to get rich and increasing production for the country" has deeply penetrated the countryside. Under the policy of "organizing together," the organization of peasant mutual aid teams and rural cooperatives has greatly developed.

In the field of industrial and commercial activities, there are still blind phenomena and many selfish behaviors that are not conducive to the overall situation, which can only be achieved through improving and gradually strengthening the planning of the economic sector to achieve comprehensive consideration. The relationship between state-owned and private enterprises should be rectified in the principle of recognizing state-owned leadership to correct behaviors that hinder the overall situation and the big picture and selfish behaviors. Various places in East China, especially Shanghai, should specially organize financial and economic workers and the industrial and commercial circles to study the report of Comrade Chen Yun on economic work and financial work, and use this report as a weapon to adjust the relationship between the public and private sectors, manage the market, maintain price stability, and strive to continue the improvement of the national economy.

**6. Cultural and Educational Work in East China**

With the recovery and development of urban and rural economies, people's cultural and educational undertakings have made unprecedented progress. From the second half of 1950 to the first half of this year, the number of primary school students increased from 6,496,505 to 8,876,457, an increase of 35%; the number of middle school students increased from 373,807 to 443,853; the number of higher education students increased from 34,433 to 41,086, all increasing by 20%. This autumn, various levels of schools have increased classes and enrollment, and the number of students has increased even more; the proportion of children of workers and peasants entering school is also greater than before. The number of peasants participating in winter schools increased from 360 million in 1949 to 716 million in 1950, of which 327 million transferred to regular schools. It is estimated that the number of winter school students this year will increase to 1,500 million, of which 600 million will transfer to regular schools. Workers' supplementary schools have been widely opened in various places, and Shanghai has also opened night middle schools and evening primary schools, providing more opportunities for working workers and out-of-school children to receive education, laying the foundation for the campaign to eliminate illiteracy. Various places have extensively carried out the work of preventing epidemics and local diseases, and Shanghai has mobilized a large number of medical workers to assist the garrison troops in the suburbs to prevent and control schistosomiasis, achieving great results. Under the policy of "prevention first," East China has extensively carried out various prevention and control work. Since liberation, major cities have not had outbreaks of cholera and other epidemics, and the prevalence of black fever in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu and schistosomiasis in southern Jiangsu has been greatly reduced. Other cultural, artistic, scientific popularization, news publishing, and broadcasting work have implemented the policy of facing workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have also achieved significant political and ideological educational effects. Especially after the film "Wu Xun" was criticized and reviewed, the leadership of ideological and political work in the arts was strengthened, the direction of the development of art work was further clarified, and the correct development of art work in the future was greatly helped. On October 12, 170 branches of the New China Bookstore simultaneously issued "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and people from all walks of life rushed to buy them. Shanghai sold out all copies in one day and pre-ordered 30,000 more, breaking the previous record of any book issuance.

Since January this year, various levels of schools in East China that have registered to receive foreign aid have totaled 677, and other cultural and medical institutions have totaled 412 (including 327 schools and 212 cultural and medical institutions receiving U.S. aid), and active measures have been taken to handle them. The religious circles, with Nanjing and Shanghai as the centers, have extensively carried out the "Three-Self" movement, eliminating a large number of imperialist elements hiding under the cloak of religion, dissolving the Catholic Action Association and the "Holy Mother Army" and other reactionary spy organizations, basically eliminating the cultural infiltration of imperialism, reclaiming cultural and educational sovereignty, and realizing true religious freedom.

The primary task of cultural and educational work is ideological remolding, which has not been as successful in East China and Shanghai as in Beijing and Tianjin in directly obtaining the leadership and enlightenment of the central authorities. In the past year, the achievements are not very great, but the current affairs education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has been done a lot, and the achievements are relatively significant. The policy education linked with the work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries and land reform is also successful, but the basic political and ideological education of learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is not enough, which is a new aspect of work that needs to be done with greater effort in the future.

**7. Democratic Political Construction**

Through the above-mentioned work, people's political awareness has been significantly enhanced, people's organizations have been expanding and strengthening, and the work of democratic political construction has also been advanced. Except for Fujian, all provinces in East China have held people's representative congresses, generally exercising the functions of the people's congresses. According to statistics from January to August this year, 94% of county-level units have held people's representative congresses, of which eight cities and three counties have exercised the functions of the people's congresses. Large cities have generally held district people's representative congresses, and Shanghai has held two city and district people's representative joint conferences. Various levels of people's representative congresses have established consultation committees or standing committees to strengthen daily work. The production of people's representatives is generally through election or selection. In the second session of the Shanghai People's Representative Congress, 823 representatives, 96.5% were produced through election or selection. In addition, various provinces (regions) have successively carried out the adjustment of districts and townships, strengthening the work of grassroots political power, and some regions have held township people's representative congresses and elected township people's governments. In the past two years, the political work in East China has achieved results in establishing institutions, mastering and learning democratic consultation methods, preparing and convening various levels of people's representative congresses, cleaning up the internal affairs, reorganizing the organs, and various aspects of work. In the mobilization of the masses to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, it has been proven that various levels of people's governments have indeed gained the support of the people, and the connection with the people is increasingly strengthened. In leading the two major movements of land reform and suppression of counterrevolutionaries, it has been proven on the one hand that the people's governments are closely connected with the people, and on the other hand, it has been proven that the people's governments have the ability to implement their policies and have the ability to call on the masses to firmly suppress any counterrevolutionary activities. This is achieved by relying on the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the central people's government, relying on the support of the broad masses of the people, and relying on the unity and efforts of various democratic parties.

The future tasks of East China's political work are to pay attention to the review and cleanup of many takeover organs, organize the rectification and learning of cadres at various levels, and combine these two points to carry out the reorganization and streamlining of organs. Generally, pay attention to improving the leadership style to strengthen the connection with the people. Convene various levels of people's representative congresses and consultation committees to seriously discuss and implement the central tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and increasing production and practicing strict economy.

**8. Striving to Make the Work in 1952 Better Than This Year**

I have briefly reported on the work of East China in the past year. The achievements in work are due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the central people's government, the support of the people, the unity of the parties, and our own efforts. However, the correct leadership of Chairman Mao is an extremely important and decisive condition. Without this condition, we would make mistakes, and with the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, we can quickly correct our mistakes even if we make them. Therefore, our courage in work is high, and our confidence is great. We take a self-critical and serious attitude towards the main shortcomings in our work—insufficient connection with the masses and insufficient understanding of the situation, as well as other shortcomings and mistakes—and correct them quickly. We are good at seizing the initiative in ideological leadership and using the weapon of self-criticism to seriously and earnestly treat work, so we certainly have the ability and hope to make the work in 1952 better than in 1951!

**Speech by Du Ping, Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army**

**Firmly Carrying Out the Will of the People of the Motherland to Defeat the Enemy**

**Chairman, Comrades, and Fellow Representatives:**

I, as a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, first express my enthusiastic support for Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's political report, Vice-Chairman Chen Chutong's work report, Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen's report on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the motherland, Vice Premier Chen's report on economic work and financial work, and Vice Premier Guo's report on cultural and educational work. I am ready to study these reports as study materials in the volunteer army.

From the reports, we understand that our great motherland, after the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counterrevolutionaries, as well as the peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue, has achieved unprecedented unity. The people of the entire country are more united than ever, national defense forces have been greatly strengthened, financial and commodity prices continue to be stable, economic construction and cultural undertakings are continuously developing, and the power of people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated. These great achievements have made our country's situation bright, and this time our delegation of heroes has seen with their own eyes the thriving situation in various aspects of the motherland, feeling very excited and increasing our courage and confidence in fighting on the Korean front. Please allow me, on behalf of all the comrades of the volunteer army fighting on the Korean front, to pay the highest tribute to the great leader who leads our country to victory and prosperity, Comrade Mao Zedong!

In the past year, the victory of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend the motherland has been achieved through mutual encouragement and cooperation between the front and the rear. The victory at home and on the Korean front are mutually inspiring. The people of the entire country are cheering for this great victory.

Now, let me briefly report the situation on the Korean front to the conference.

Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at this conference: "If it were not for the U.S. military occupying our country's Taiwan, invading the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and attacking our northeastern border, the Chinese people would not fight against the U.S. military. But since the U.S. aggressors have already attacked us, we have no choice but to raise the banner of anti-aggression." One year ago, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army appeared on the Korean battlefield under such circumstances to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army, and it has been exactly one year now.

The past year has indeed been a year of hardship, but it has also been a year of great victory. Our army has encountered many difficulties on the Korean battlefield. However, we have not bowed our heads in the face of difficulties. Relying on our own courage and wisdom, we have fought while learning, created various methods to overcome difficulties, and with extreme perseverance, endured many unimaginable hardships, but finally overcame the difficulties and achieved victory. Our equipment is not as good as the enemy's, but because the war we are fighting is a just anti-aggression war, every member of our army has a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and in battle, they have shown a resolute, tenacious, and fearless spirit, thus defeating the well-equipped U.S. aggressors.

In the past year, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have jointly conducted five large-scale battles, pushing the front line from the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, and have conducted strong defensive battles and partial counterattacks in the 38th parallel area, making the enemy pay a heavy price. According to incomplete statistics, 387,000 enemy troops have been annihilated, more than 2,300 enemy aircraft have been destroyed or damaged, a large amount of enemy ammunition and supplies have been consumed, and the aggressors have been trapped in the long-term war of attrition that they most dread. This glorious victory not only disrupted the arrogant aggression plan of U.S. imperialism, laid the foundation for the victory of the anti-aggression war of the Chinese and Korean peoples, consolidated our motherland's national defense, but also made a great contribution to the peace and democratic cause of the people of the world, and greatly encouraged the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples in the East. The past year's facts have proven that the superiority or inferiority of weapons and equipment cannot determine the outcome of a war, but the just nature of the war is the decisive factor for victory.

The victory of the volunteer army in the past year is inseparable from the strong support of the motherland and the direct help of the Korean people. The 475 million people of the motherland have fully supported our fighting on the Korean front. Many workers and peasants have said that whatever is needed on the Korean battlefield will be provided, with people and money readily available. We are very satisfied with the support of the people of the motherland. This conference has also passed the resolution on the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, making the victory of the anti-aggression war in Korea even more certain. Therefore, we express our heartfelt thanks to the people of the entire country, to various democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic personages from all walks of life. At the same time, we also need to carry out a nationwide frugality movement, overcome waste, and make reasonable use of all manpower, material resources, and financial resources on the front line, so that every bit of support from the people of the motherland can be fully utilized in the struggle for victory.

In the past year, we have fought fierce and arduous battles with the enemy, including offensive, defensive, mobile, and positional attacks. This has enabled our army to gain rich experience in fighting against the U.S. aggressors, learning a set of skills to defeat modernized enemy equipment with inferior equipment. Our army has made new developments in military work, political work, logistics, and transportation. In terms of organizational structure and work methods, it has become more suitable for the current war requirements. These experiences are the most precious, and with these experiences, we are more confident and assured of defeating the enemy. Our army has made significant progress in tactical command, and various commanders have gradually learned to master the laws of war, learned to command combined arms, and administrative management, and can effectively command communications and liaison. Our army's equipment has made a leap forward, and technology has also significantly improved. Due to the continuous strengthening of our army's air defense weapons, the number of enemy aircraft shot down or damaged has greatly increased. In the summer, an average of more than 100 enemy aircraft were shot down or damaged per month, and in the autumn, an average of 200 to 300 enemy aircraft were shot down or damaged per month. With the strengthening of our army's artillery, the killing of the enemy has also greatly increased. From October 25 last year to May 21 this year, in the five battles, the enemy's average daily casualties were 904, in the enemy's so-called summer offensive from May 22 to September 24, the enemy's average daily casualties were 1,291, and in the enemy's so-called autumn offensive in the first 16 days from September 25 to October 10, the enemy's average daily casualties were 1,918; and in the three days from October 13 to 15, the enemy's casualty rate reached the highest record of more than 5,600 per day. This makes the enemy pay a greater price for attacking us, and such a large consumption of manpower is something that U.S. imperialism cannot sustain for a long time. Our army has also accumulated many good experiences in logistics and transportation, and has many new creations. In the recent period, although the enemy's air raids on our rear have not weakened, our losses have been greatly reduced. This has ensured the supply of grain and ammunition and made the front-line troops already wearing new winter clothes. The sanitary facilities have also been greatly improved. In the past year, all units and departments of our army have, on the basis of patriotism and internationalism, carried out high revolutionary heroism. All commanders and soldiers regard it as the greatest honor to fight for the people of the motherland, the Korean people, and the people of the world. Therefore, in every battle and every task, a large number of heroes and models have emerged, and under their influence and promotion, the fighting spirit and work enthusiasm of the entire army have been continuously rising. In summary, at present, our entire army has sufficient manpower, high morale, and unprecedented combat effectiveness. Because we have such a powerful force, all commanders and soldiers are full of confidence in victory.

At present, the Korean War is still ongoing, and the enemy has not shown any sincerity in peace. We hereby declare to the conference: We have realized that the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the motherland entrusted to us by the people of the entire country is glorious and great. We are determined to continue to carry out the will of the people of the motherland and fight to the end with the aggressors, no matter how many difficulties lie ahead and how arduous the war is, we will overcome the difficulties with the greatest perseverance. We will definitely defeat the enemy, protect our beautiful and great motherland, and defend the peace of the East and the world. Let us shout:

Long live the powerful People's Republic of China!
Long live the glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
Long live the fraternal fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
Long live our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong!

**Speech by Li Shucheng, Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture**

**Striving for a Greater Patriotic Production Movement**

**Chairman, Comrades, and Fellow Representatives:**

In his opening speech at this conference, Chairman Mao said: "On the industrial and agricultural fronts, the patriotic production movement that is developing is a new phenomenon worthy of celebration for our country." In the two years since the establishment of the central people's government, national agricultural production has achieved significant recovery and partial development, reversing the downward trend of agricultural production caused by the destruction and sabotage of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits. Through two years of efforts, the general level of production in most regions has approached the level before the war of resistance, and most old liberated areas have reached the pre-war level, while some old liberated areas have exceeded the pre-war level. For example, the total agricultural production value of Shanxi Province has exceeded the pre-war level by 16.2%; the total grain production of Shandong Province has exceeded the pre-war level by 9%; the agricultural production of the Northeast region has exceeded its historical highest level (1943) by 7.6%. Now, the total grain production of the country has recovered to 92.8% of the highest annual production before the war; the total cotton production has exceeded the highest annual production before the war by 17.8%, basically changing the semi-colonial status of domestic grain and cotton supply relying on imports during the reactionary rule. Moreover, due to the recovery and development of agricultural production, the living standards of the people have also been significantly improved. For example, the purchasing power of the people in the Northeast has doubled in 1951 compared to 1949; for example, in terms of cotton cloth: in 1949, the average was one piece per ten people, and in 1951, the average was one piece per three people. After the completion of land reform in the old liberated areas, after two to three years of production, 70-80% of the peasants are living a middle peasant life. The phenomenon of building houses, adding agricultural tools, livestock, and fertilizers in rural areas is very common. This fully shows that the current rural economic situation has begun to move towards prosperity and prosperity.

The reason why national agricultural production has achieved such rapid recovery in just two years is, first of all, due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the people's government, the brave and skilled fighting of the People's Liberation Army, which has achieved victory in the war of liberation throughout the country, and then through the suppression of bandits and local tyrants, stabilizing social order, and providing the peasants with an environment to fully engage in production.

Secondly, it is due to the completion of land reform in more than 300 million people's areas nationwide, liberating agricultural productivity. Other regions have also carried out the rent reduction and interest reduction movements, and the peasants' production enthusiasm has reached an unprecedented level. The central people's government has also timely promulgated a series of policies to protect and encourage production, such as "whoever plants, whoever harvests," "free borrowing," "reasonable burden," and "cotton-grain price ratio," which have further stabilized and improved the peasants' production enthusiasm and ensured the completion of the agricultural production plan.

The resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and the suppression of counterrevolutionaries have consolidated land reform, aroused the peasants' patriotic production enthusiasm to support the front line. Many regions' peasants, under the call to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend the motherland, have increased their love for the motherland, deepened their hatred for imperialism, and they have enthusiastically formulated patriotic production and donation plans, using their efforts to increase production and donate to enrich the content of the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea movement, making this year's agricultural production movement present a new appearance.

It is particularly worth mentioning that in the past two years, the significant recovery of national agricultural production has been achieved in the midst of a fierce struggle against natural disasters. Due to the long-term destruction of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, a serious flood occurred in 1949, but through the efforts of various places, the agricultural income of 1950 was basically guaranteed, especially this year's Huai River project has achieved initial success, generally overcoming the serious threat of floods to agriculture. In 1950, various places in the country carried out pest control on more than 100 million mu of cultivated land, reducing agricultural losses by approximately 16 billion jin. In 1951, the area and severity of pest damage exceeded last year, and the area of locust, aphid, and borer damage alone reached more than 120 million mu. However, through the leadership of various levels of government in mobilizing the masses to prevent, capture, and kill, they have basically been eliminated. In areas where locusts are seriously affected, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government specially dispatched the air force to assist in extermination, which is an unprecedented event in our country's history and something that the Kuomintang reactionary regime could never do. In 1951, 15 provinces and regions in the country, with approximately 90 million mu of farmland, suffered from drought, and approximately 35 million mu were affected. After mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of peasants to fight against drought, in North China, most cotton fields were sown, and water was carried to sow seeds, completing the task with great difficulty; in the south, many mountainous areas implemented the organization of water wheels, continuous water lifting, and mountain irrigation methods, reducing the area of drought. Due to the active dredging of canals, digging of wells, and construction of ponds and dams by the people of the entire country, a mass movement to fight against drought has been launched, increasing the irrigation area by more than 85 million mu. In 1951, agricultural production was seriously threatened by various natural disasters. If it were during the reactionary rule, it would inevitably lead to a great famine, but due to the leadership of the people's government and the various levels of party committees of the Communist Party of China, leading the masses to carry out unremitting and arduous struggles, the production of major crops such as grain and cotton was finally ensured to exceed last year, thus strengthening our determination and confidence to overcome natural disasters in the future.

In the past two years, the significant recovery of national agricultural production has been achieved in the midst of the widespread development of the patriotic production movement, implementing the policy of organizing together to develop production. The number of households participating in mutual aid teams in various places: in the North China region, it accounts for 60% of the total number of households; in the Northeast region, it reaches 70%; in the new areas where land reform has been completed, mutual aid organizations have also developed greatly. The content of mutual aid teams in old liberated areas has gradually developed from the past simple labor and animal power mutual aid to economic and production cooperation, and agricultural production cooperatives or land cooperatives have appeared, which is a great creation of the masses. The superiority of mutual aid and cooperative organizations is first reflected in the significant increase in production, which is obviously superior to individual farming. For example, the mutual aid teams of Li Shunda in Shanxi, Han En in Jilin, and Lü Hongbin in Shandong have all increased production by more than double compared to before the war. The facts have proven that the policy stipulated in the Common Program, "in all areas where land reform has been thoroughly implemented, the people's government should organize peasants and all labor forces that can engage in agriculture to develop agricultural production and its sideline industries as the central task, and should guide peasants to gradually organize various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit," is completely correct. Organizing together is the correct direction to improve technology, increase efficiency, and develop agricultural production. In the future, we should further implement the policy of large-scale development and steady improvement, so that the patriotic production movement can achieve greater development.

In this year's patriotic production movement, typical cases of significantly increased production per unit area have emerged, such as the labor model Li Shunda from Shanxi, who is attending this conference, produced 980 jin of corn per mu this year; the labor model Qu Yaoqi from Shanxi created a new record of 920 jin of cotton per mu, exceeding the national average production per mu before the war by more than twelve times; the labor model Zhang Xishun from Hebei produced 1,300 jin of sorghum per mu this year, exceeding the average production per mu in North China before the war by more than eight times; the labor model Wang Xihe from Pingyuan produced 900 jin of wheat per mu this year, exceeding the pre-war level by nine times; the labor model Zhou Fengji from Dunhua County, Jilin Province, produced 1,400 jin of rice per mu; the labor model Tang Yumin from Jiangyin County, Suzhou, produced 1,200 jin of rice per mu; the labor model Tan Chaoliang from Yunnan Province produced 992 jin of rice per mu; in the Xiaozhan District of Tianjin, 126 households of farmers produced more than 1,000 jin of rice per mu, of which Zhou Yubin produced more than 1,400 jin of rice per mu. These high-yielding examples are emerging in various places and are no longer just individual households in some regions. They have set an example for the broad masses of peasants and established a banner, strongly demonstrating that the production per unit area can be greatly increased, and our great motherland's agricultural production has a bright future. The high-yielding examples that have emerged in the production movement in the past two years have further inspired and strengthened the patriotic production confidence of the broad masses of peasants nationwide. Therefore, the 1952 agricultural production requires the policy of increasing production per unit area, which is completely correct. To strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the construction of the country, and to quickly restore and exceed the pre-war production level, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "as long as we are good at uniting, educating, and relying on workers and peasants, our country will definitely see a universal upsurge of patriotic production movement." We are willing to exert all our efforts to strive for a greater patriotic production movement.

**Speech by Zhang Yun, Representative of Women Workers**

**Uniting and Educating Broad Masses of Women to Become a Force for Building the Motherland**

**Chairman, Comrades, and Fellow Representatives:**

We women workers fully agree with and enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's political report, and the work reports of other responsible comrades, as well as the reports on the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the motherland, economic work and financial work, and cultural and educational work.

We women workers, like representatives from all walks of life, have the determination and courage to implement Chairman Mao's instructions: "Continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which requires increasing production and practicing strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." We will spare no effort to further mobilize and organize women and unite with the people of all walks of life to complete this important task.

In the new China, where the revolution has been victorious, the people have become masters, and women's rights have been legally guaranteed, at a time when U.S. imperialism is still delaying negotiations and continuing the war of aggression against Korea, and the great struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea still needs to be continued, the primary responsibility of us women workers is: to unite the broad masses of women, raise their political awareness, cultivate their ability to engage in construction work, and make them a great force for building the motherland and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. To achieve this goal, another major responsibility is to strive to implement the provisions of Article 6 of the Common Program: "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that binds women. Women have equal rights with men in political, economic, cultural and educational, and social life. Implement free marriage for men and women."

In the past two years, due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the people's government, the support and cooperation of various democratic parties and people's organizations, the old feudal marriage system that has plagued women for thousands of years is rapidly collapsing, and the new democratic marriage system is being established. The status of women in the family and society has been significantly improved. On the production front, the implementation of equal pay for equal work for men and women has begun. The scope of women's participation in various social activities has become wider. The number of women participating in politics has also gradually increased, and various levels of people's governments and people's representative congresses have women participating. Some city and county-level people's representative congresses have women accounting for about 10%. Various levels of people's government committees have female committee members. Therefore, the various calls of the motherland have been enthusiastically responded to by women; in the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counterrevolutionaries, women have shown high initiative and played a considerable role. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, a large number of women voluntarily sent their husbands and sons to the army, and they themselves studied industrial or agricultural technology and engaged in production, overcoming difficulties. Many women carried out increased production and donations, donating aircraft and cannons. Just in Shanghai, the housewives have donated seven aircraft (90 billion yuan has been remitted), and nationwide, women from various systems and walks of life have donated nearly 60 aircraft named after women. In the land reform movement, women, like men, showed initiative, courage, and strength, especially in denouncing the crimes of landlords, their deep and moving denunciations played a great role in encouragement and education. In the movement to suppress counterrevolutionaries, women showed even greater loyalty, and many clever tactics to catch spies and righteous acts of killing relatives for the greater good emerged.

The above facts show what? On the one hand, it shows that only the people's China led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao cares about the interests of women, and women can stand up to serve and defend the motherland; on the other hand, it shows that women, like men, have talents and wisdom, and as long as they are organized, they are a powerful force.

However, the new China has only been established for two years, and the thousands of years of feudal thought of valuing men over women and male supremacy in China has not yet been, and cannot be quickly, eliminated. There are still many obstacles on the road of women's progress, preventing women's strength from being fully exerted. Many people do not attach enough importance to Article 6 of the Common Program. Especially the Marriage Law has been promulgated for more than a year, but so far, a large number of women have not been liberated from the feudal marriage system and feudal ideology, and many women are still being enslaved and abused. Women fighting for marriage freedom and being killed or committing suicide are constantly occurring. After such phenomena occur, some people turn a blind eye, some people think that the death of a few women is not a big deal; even some government officials and local cadres take a hands-off attitude towards such barbaric behavior. Some even deliberately cover up and protect; even some cadres directly interfere with women's marriage freedom, arranging marriages for women. Therefore, many women reflect that "the overthrow of parental arranged marriages has been replaced by cadre-arranged marriages." This shows that these cadres themselves have serious feudal thoughts, do not attach importance to the provisions of Article 6 of the Common Program, and have not well understood the orders of the people's government—the Marriage Law. This shows that feudal remnants are still quite rampant. To accelerate the construction of the motherland and expand the force to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to implement the provisions of Article 6 of the Common Program, to implement the Marriage Law, and to launch a nationwide campaign against feudal ideology, to strengthen the concept of gender equality, is urgently needed at present. The State Council of the Central People's Government has timely issued instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law and dispatched inspection teams to various places to inspect, effectively supporting women's anti-feudal struggle. We are satisfied with and support these measures. We women workers have not done enough in the past, and in the future, we should first strengthen this work and strive to achieve results. At the same time, we urgently request that various levels of people's governments, consultation committees, democratic parties, and people's organizations provide more powerful support and cooperate through various work.

Here, we propose the main requirements for women's work in 1952. Women's work should be centered around the current central task to achieve new achievements, which must be reflected in four aspects:

First, the number and quality of women participating in politics, production, study, and various work should be significantly increased and improved. In the continued movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend the motherland, we should show more strength and play a supporting role.

Second, continue to vigorously promote and implement the Marriage Law to make it known to every household and every person. In areas where land reform has been completed, it is required to thoroughly abolish arranged marriages and implement marriage freedom.

Third, strive to cultivate a large number of women to become a reserve force for production, welcome the large-scale production and construction of the motherland, and strive to gradually move family labor women to social labor in a planned way.

Fourth, call on the cadres of the Democratic Women's Federation at all levels to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, remold their thoughts, and improve their work. The above items, first of all, women workers must exert great efforts, but since women are from various walks of life, and there are women in various walks of life, it is determined that women's work penetrates various work and people's organizations, so it is still necessary for various levels of people's governments, consultation committees, democratic parties, and people's organizations to provide leadership and support. Especially in mobilizing, organizing, and educating the masses, it is required to adopt the policy of mobilizing men and women together proposed by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and at the same time, educate and improve the women in the masses, solve and address the women's issues in the masses. This will be more conducive to the cause of democratic construction.

Only in this way can women be fully mobilized, women's issues be thoroughly solved, and the strength of the broad masses of women be better exerted in the great cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the motherland.

Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the People's Republic of China!

**Speech by Li Shunda, Agricultural Labor Model**

**Farmers to Achieve the Three Major Tasks of Increased Production, Frugality, and Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea**

**Leaders, Comrades, and Fellow Representatives:**

I, as a representative of agricultural labor models, would like to express some opinions. At this conference, we have heard the reports of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and various leaders, and we fully agree and support them; we also agree with the speeches of representatives from all walks of life. Our country, under the leadership of the beloved leader Chairman Mao, has achieved such great results in various aspects in the past two years, especially in the great victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which makes us very excited and truly happy. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou's reports have already instructed us that in the future, we need to do three major things: continue to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increase production, and practice strict economy. Please rest assured, Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and various leaders, that we will do a good job of these three tasks when we return. How will we do it?

First, let's talk about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea: The Chinese people have always loved peace, and we do not invade others, but we also cannot tolerate others invading us. Whoever wants to invade us, we will defeat them. The U.S. imperialists want to bully and occupy the land of other countries, oppress the people of the world, they have occupied our China's Taiwan, and want to annihilate our neighboring country Korea, and then invade China from Korea. We all know that the people of the entire country can no longer tolerate it, so they organized the volunteer army to go to Korea. The volunteer army has been in Korea for a year, fighting many battles with the Korean People's Army, and has annihilated more than 380,000 enemy troops. This proves that what Chairman Mao said, that the U.S. is a paper tiger, is correct. Chairman Mao has determined that U.S. imperialism will definitely fail, and we completely believe in Chairman Mao's words and listen to Chairman Mao's instructions. During the National Day celebration, we also saw many new weapons: jet aircraft, rocket artillery, tanks, and other new weapons whose names we can't even say, and our confidence in victory is even more solid. However, we also know that U.S. imperialism is not giving up, and in the negotiations, it has no sincerity at all, just like the Kuomintang's negotiations with us in the past. Therefore, we must be vigilant and be ready at all times. If they dare to attack again, we will give them a bigger blow. When we return, we will actively promote the reports of the leaders about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, mobilize the peasants to sign patriotic covenants, increase production and practice strict economy, take care of the families of soldiers and martyrs, donate aircraft and cannons, and firmly support the volunteer army.

Second, let's talk about increasing production. The important task of us farmers is to produce more grain, more industrial raw materials, and more livestock. Next year, we must better organize mutual aid teams, improve production technology, and increase production. My place is a mountainous area, and the conditions for increasing production are difficult, but I have the confidence to overcome all difficulties, cultivate the land carefully, apply more fertilizer, and ensure that each mu of land produces 20 jin more grain, and I propose to all farmer brothers across the country to launch the high-yield movement. We all agree that we should learn from the workers' older brothers, think of more ways, improve technology, and not be satisfied with the old ways of production. Comrade Zhang Xishun, this year, one mu of sorghum produced 1,300 jin, and he said that next year, he will further increase the production. Comrade Qu Yaoqi, this year, one mu of cotton produced 920 jin of cottonseed, and he said that he will ensure that next year, one mu will exceed 1,000 jin. All agricultural labor models should achieve high yields. We not only increase our own production but also promote the increase of production among the masses and help the families of soldiers and martyrs increase production. Only by producing more can we improve our own lives and meet the needs of the country.

Third, let's talk about frugality. Frugality is not only needed in state organs, factories, schools, and cities, but it is also needed in rural areas. Chairman Mao's call for frugality is very timely, because in the past two years, we have achieved a bumper harvest, and life has improved, and some wasteful things have occurred in rural areas, such as banquets, gifts, and large-scale performances for weddings and funerals. If we launch a frugality movement, we don't know how much money we can save and use for production to achieve an even greater bumper harvest. How will we launch the frugality movement?

Title: 1951年9月29日中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议
Author:
Date: 1951-09-29
Page: 1

**Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th**

1. **Lead the People in Planning Family Life, Save Every Grain of Food**

   Comrades, the saying goes: "You won't go hungry if you eat wisely, you won't go broke if you dress wisely, but if you don't plan, you'll be poor for life." Everything must be planned. Don't spend money on things you shouldn't, don't do things you shouldn't. Don't waste a single grain of food. During harvest time, don't drop a single grain. For example, in the Northeast, Comrade Deng Guozhang and his fellow villagers ensure that every grain is collected during threshing, and each family can thus collect an additional five to six piculs of grain. During storage, prevent losses from rats and insects. Especially, mobilize the women to eliminate "stove tax."

   ("Stove tax" refers to the situation where, in households with abundant grain, women tend to be wasteful when cooking, adding too much rice or flour, resulting in waste. Hence, we call it "stove tax.")

2. **Reduce Expenditures for Red and White Ceremonies**

3. **Reduce Expenditures for Banquets and Gifts**

   Upon returning, we will definitely propagate Chairman Mao's and the leaders' instructions, and through reading groups and discussion meetings, ensure that the documents distributed to us are read, explained, and discussed, so that everyone understands our country's achievements over the past two years and the victory of one year of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. We will also accept Chairman Mao's instructions on our three major tasks and respond to Chairman Mao and the leaders with our work achievements.

   Long live Chairman Mao!
   Long live the Communist Party of China!
   Long live the People's Republic of China!

   **Speech by Steel Worker Guo Shude**

   **Carry Forward the Spirit of Patriotism, Strive for Production, and Practice Thrift**

   Chairman, Commissioners, Comrades:

   Listening to the reports from the leaders of the Central People's Government has made us feel very excited and happy. We firmly support these reports and will strive for the complete realization of the tasks outlined in them.

   The New China has only been established for two years, but in this short period, the Chinese people have achieved tremendous successes in political, economic, military, and cultural reforms and construction. Now, except for Taiwan, we have liberated all our territory, eliminated one million Nationalist bandits, and established a solid people's democratic government. We have launched and are continuing the three major campaigns of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, and have achieved brilliant victories. Internationally, our country has established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and 19 other countries and has formed an unbreakable friendly alliance with the Soviet Union. Due to all this, our motherland, the People's Republic of China, has become increasingly strong and prosperous.

   The Chinese people have been able to achieve such brilliant and great successes because of the correct leadership of the wise leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government. We, the working class, salute the Central People's Government! We salute the Communist Party of China! We salute the great and wise leader—Chairman Mao!

   We know that American imperialism and the remnants of the Kuomintang will not accept defeat and will continue to sabotage our peaceful construction. American imperialism launched a crazy war of aggression against Korea last year, openly occupied our territory of Taiwan, illegally signed a separate peace treaty with Japan, actively rearmed Japan, repeatedly violated the agreement on the neutral zone in Kaesong, and intentionally obstructed the peace talks in Korea. These facts fully prove that American imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and has aroused the indignation of the Chinese people from all walks of life and the people of the world who love peace.

   The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have, after thirty years of arduous struggle, won the victory fruits, which we will not allow any imperialist to invade. Our brave Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting heroically in Korea, resolutely going abroad to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army to resist the invading army of American imperialism, all for the purpose of defending the motherland and defending peace. In the past year, the heroic fighting of the People's Volunteers has established great merits, severely striking the aggressive arrogance of American imperialism, and smashing its plans of aggression in the Far East and the world, giving great encouragement to the oppressed nations and peace-loving people of the world. During this period, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country have launched a magnificent movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, universally signed patriotic covenants, and carried out patriotic labor competitions, actively completing the increased production and donation plans, powerfully supporting the just war of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. In the future, we will more closely unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, further carry forward the spirit of patriotism, strive for production, practice thrift, defend our great motherland, smash all the aggressive plots of imperialism, strive for the victory of the Korean War, and defend the peace of the Far East and the world.

   Let those warmongers tremble before us!

   Long live the People's Republic of China!
   Long live the Communist Party of China!
   Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

   **Speech by Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, Bao Erhan (Uyghur)**

   **The People of Xinjiang Have a Bright Future**

   Chairman, Commissioners, Comrades:

   Listening to Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's political report, and the reports from the leaders, I feel extremely excited and happy. On behalf of the various nationalities in the Northwest, I pay my highest respects to our victorious inspirer and leader, our great leader Chairman Mao, and congratulate the people of our motherland on the great victories achieved in politics, economy, culture, and on the front of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea!

   We fully support Chairman Mao's instructions, Premier Zhou's report, and the reports from the leaders. We guarantee to strive resolutely for the complete implementation of their instructions.

   In the past two years since liberation, the people of Xinjiang, relying on the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, have thoroughly eliminated the counter-revolutionary armed forces long nurtured by the Kuomintang bandits and the British and American imperialists, transformed the surrendered troops, consolidated local security, implemented the system of people's representative assemblies, and established people's governments. Among the various nationalities, a unprecedented equality, friendship, and mutual assistance have been established, and the backward situation of mutual hatred and estrangement caused by the reactionary rule has been completely eliminated.

   The living conditions of the people of Xinjiang have now improved to some extent. The cultivated land area has increased by 24.04% compared to 1949, and the yield has increased by 34.1%. The cotton fields have increased by 9.56%, and the yield of raw cotton has increased by 28.78%. The policy of equal exchange by the state-owned trade companies has promoted the development of domestic and foreign trade, allowing the people's major local products such as furs, cotton, and raisins to be sold nationwide, exchanging for the daily necessities and agricultural production tools needed by the people, such as cloth and tea.

   Political reforms and improved living conditions have strengthened the political and production enthusiasm of the people of various nationalities.

   Before liberation, the people of the border nationalities had long suffered under the reactionary government's policy of national oppression. Not only did they not know that our motherland was so great, so beautiful, and so lovable, but they also had considerable estrangement towards the Han nationality. However, after the People's Liberation Army liberated Xinjiang, there was a great change in the minds of the people of various nationalities. They understood that the people who oppressed them were not the Han nationality, but the reactionary ruling class of the Han nationality. They understood that the Han nationality people were indeed great friends of the border nationalities. The great, advanced, and revolutionary Han nationality people are the backbone of the Chinese revolution. Only by relying on the assistance of the Han nationality people, only under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, only under the correct leadership of the Northwest Military and Political Commission and the CPC Central Committee's Xinjiang Branch, and the brotherly assistance of the People's Liberation Army, can the people of various nationalities in Xinjiang obtain their true freedom, equality, and happy life today, and can guarantee the bright future of various nationalities.

   The love for the motherland of the people of Xinjiang is constantly rising.

   Here, I would like to point out that last year, the minority nationality visit delegation sent by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government visited Xinjiang, and the representatives of various nationalities in Xinjiang visited Beijing and other places, which had great significance in promoting friendship among nationalities. Those who had suffered humiliation and contempt during the reactionary rule, especially the elderly, were deeply moved when they saw the visit delegation coming, saying, "Chairman Mao sent a visit delegation to comfort us. Finally, someone came to comfort us!" They said this with tears. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" The cheers echoed through every corner of Xinjiang. The visit of the representatives of various nationalities in Xinjiang to Beijing and other places made them concretely understand the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, enriching their knowledge of the motherland. Although Xinjiang is far in the northwest border, the thoughts of the people of various nationalities are directed towards Chairman Mao and the capital Beijing where Chairman Mao is located. The people of various nationalities in Xinjiang are proud and honored to have broken free from the oppression of imperialism and the semi-colonial shackles under the leadership of Chairman Mao, becoming an equal member of the big family of the independent, unified, and prosperous People's Republic of China.

   The patriotic enthusiasm of the people of Xinjiang is particularly prominent in the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. All the people of various nationalities in Xinjiang and the staff of various institutions and organizations have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Resistance and Aid Korea Association, universally launching the movement of signing patriotic covenants and donating airplanes and cannons. The people of Xinjiang originally pledged to donate 30 airplanes and 7 cannons, which seems to have the possibility of exceeding. Because in the three special districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Alashan alone, the amount of donations has already reached 80 billion yuan, 50,000 sheep, 2,000 horses, 2,000 cattle, 80 camels, and 400,000 catties of grain. And the people's enthusiasm for donations is continuing.

   The people of Xinjiang guarantee that in the future, we will more diligently and concretely carry out all the commands of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, complete the tasks of building a new China, resolutely suppress any sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, defend the safety of our great motherland—the big family of various nationalities, consolidate the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and the peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, defend the peace of the Far East and the world.

   Long live the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers!
   Long live the great unity and cooperation of all nationalities in the country!
   Long live the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!
   Long live the great People's Republic of China!
   Long live the Communist Party of China!
   Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

   **Speech by Representative of the Old Revolutionary Base Areas, Cui Yuzhen**

   **Resolutely Carry Out Chairman Mao's Instructions, Strive for Greater Glory**

   Chairman, Commissioners, Leaders:

   We representatives of the old revolutionary base areas unanimously support Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's report, and the reports from other leaders. We are determined to bring these precious instructions back to the old revolutionary base areas, propagate them to all the people, and make them understand the current goals of struggle, unite as one, and strive for the glorious tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and production and thrift.

   The people of the old revolutionary base areas have long understood that following Chairman Mao will lead to liberation. Therefore, they fear neither the evil imperialism nor the oppression, slaughter, attacks, and sabotage of the Kuomintang bandits. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, they have worked hard, fought bravely, and fearlessly sacrificed their blood and lives, contributing people and money. After more than twenty years of struggle, they have finally liberated the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. This is the glory of the people of the old revolutionary base areas and also the glory of the people of the whole country. But we must not be complacent. We are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's call, carry forward the revolutionary tradition, and strive for greater glory.

   Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have joined hands to overthrow the reactionary rule, established the people's own government, and the people have become the masters of the state. They will no longer be bullied by those imperialists, Kuomintang bandits, and local tyrants and evil gentry. At the same time, land has been distributed, feudal exploitation has been eliminated, counter-revolutionaries have been suppressed, bandits have been eliminated, and the roots of the bad seeds have been cut off. Now the sky belongs to the people, the land belongs to the people, and those weeds will never grow on the people's land again. Those locusts will never fly in the people's sky again. After liberation, Chairman Mao and the people's government have led us to carry out many great tasks such as recovery and development of production and education, making the people live and work in peace and prosperity, and their lives are getting better day by day. However, the evil American imperialism does not want the people of New China to live a free and happy life. It wants to destroy our free and happy life. It wants to turn the Chinese people back into slaves like before. Therefore, it launched the war of aggression against Korea last summer, simultaneously occupying our territory—Taiwan, and bombing our Northeast. It wants to follow the old path of the Japanese devils—to destroy Korea and invade China, but we want to tell the American devils that the Chinese people have stood up, and many countries in the world have also stood up. The people who have stood up will defend their victory fruits and will not allow you bastards to bully us anymore. The people of the old revolutionary base areas vow to resolutely respond to all the calls of Chairman Mao, implement the worker-peasant alliance, strive for production, practice thrift, and be ready to contribute people and money whenever the country needs them. At the same time, we will seriously do a good job in the preferential treatment and relief work, ensuring that the families of martyrs and soldiers have food and clothing, and the frontline soldiers fight bravely to defeat American imperialism and achieve the final victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. At the same time, we will join hands with the people of the world to struggle for peace and democracy.

   In addition, the people of the old revolutionary base areas have suffered long-term destruction and sabotage from the enemy and the war, and many areas have had their houses, livestock, and farm tools burned and looted by the enemy. Various economic and cultural undertakings have suffered serious sabotage, causing great disasters for the people of the old revolutionary base areas. Although there has been significant recovery after liberation, some severely damaged areas still have poor living conditions. The people of the old revolutionary base areas hope that the government will help them develop production, improve culture, rebuild their homes, and recover from war injuries, but we know that our primary task today is to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and build national defense. Therefore, we should not rely on the government to solve everything. We are determined to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," organize and unite, sign good patriotic production covenants, and strive to complete the glorious tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, consolidating national defense, and increasing production and practicing thrift.

   Finally, Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government have shown great concern for the people of the old revolutionary base areas. Not only have they led us to stand up politically and economically, but they have also given us a lot of help and encouragement in material and spiritual aspects. This year, Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government sent a visit delegation to the old revolutionary base areas, helped us solve many problems, and invited representatives of the old revolutionary base areas to Beijing to participate in the national day celebration and attend Chairman Mao's banquet. The representatives of the old revolutionary base areas observing the celebration again elected their representatives to attend the meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We have learned a lot of precious knowledge. These benefits, the people of the old revolutionary base areas will never forget. Therefore, we, the people of the old revolutionary base areas, are extremely grateful to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government for their concern, and we are grateful to the brave and skilled People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteers.

   Wish Chairman Mao, Marshal Zhu, and the government leaders good health!

   **Speech by Engineer Wang Zhixi**

   **Combine Science and Technology with the Masses to Accumulate Wealth for the State**

   Chairman, Commissioners, Comrades:

   I have listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's political report, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, Minister Chen Yun's financial and economic report, and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's cultural and educational report. I fully agree with and sincerely support them.

   In the past year, our brave Chinese People's Volunteers have achieved great victories on the Korean battlefield, driving back the invading armies of American imperialism and its accomplices. Domestically, political, economic, educational, and cultural work have achieved brilliant achievements. All this makes us feel excited and inspired. On behalf of the scientific and technological workers, I salute the Chinese People's Volunteers and the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao.

   Chairman Mao instructs us to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production and practice thrift, which is our current central task. As a technical worker in the industrial sector, what should we technical workers do in the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing thrift? Undoubtedly, our main task is to increase production and practice thrift. The wealth accumulated for the state in increasing production and practicing thrift can be used to purchase airplanes and cannons, which is a practical action to support the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

   This year, in the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the comrades in the industrial sector have already made some contributions. After the movement was launched, the working class and technical personnel, under the call of patriotism, quickly and universally joined the high tide of the patriotic movement. Many factories implemented democratic reforms, launched labor competitions, and strove to improve management systems, achieving over-plan production. Under the leadership of Chairman Gao in the Northeast, it was called for that the state-owned and public enterprises in the Northeast would increase production and practice thrift by a total of 500 million piculs of grain in the second half of 1951. This call was enthusiastically responded to by the workers in the Northeast. After the masses discussed and arranged it concretely, not only was this huge task bravely accepted, but it was also decided to double the completion, that is, to increase production and practice thrift by 1,000 million piculs of grain. Comrades, 1,000 million piculs of grain is not a small number. It is equivalent to an 8% increase in national grain production, equivalent to 630 billion yuan, which can be used to purchase more than 4,000 jet aircraft. However, this is only the achievement of increasing production and practicing thrift in the second half of the year in the state-owned and public enterprises in the Northeast, which is only the result of efforts in three aspects: increasing production, saving funds, and reducing costs. This proves that under the banner of Mao Zedong, the working class has become the master of the factory, the political awareness of the workers and technical personnel has been improved, and the production enthusiasm has been released, the great potential of industry has been shown, which is what Chairman Mao said: "Our people can display their boundless strength. This strength is invincible to any enemy."

   Comrades, Chairman Mao calls on us to increase production and practice thrift. Minister Chen has given us a task, that is, to expand the movement of increasing production and practicing thrift nationwide, and to carry out the work of increasing production and practicing thrift from more aspects, to complete one, two, or even three times the income of increasing production and practicing thrift this year. Is this task big? Very big. Can it be completed? I can definitely answer that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the mass movement, we will definitely complete it and may even over-fulfill it. To complete this huge task, we must closely unite with the working masses and do a series of important work. In the production sector, we should at least do the following:

   1. Carefully study how to improve the utilization rate of equipment, that is, study how to fully operate various production equipment, relatively extend the operating time, and how to fully exert the efficiency of the equipment;
   2. Strengthen production planning and organizational work, so that each production process is closely linked to another production process, accelerating production;
   3. Study and improve production methods and promote advanced production experience, which we have already achieved some success in;
   4. Study how to improve existing equipment and supplement key equipment to increase production. Production is often affected by the imbalance or lack of a certain key equipment, seriously affecting the output. I will give an example to illustrate this. For example, in the Northeast, the cement industry lacks large reduction gears, limiting production. If this problem can be solved and supplemented with a dozen sets of reduction gears, the production of cement can be increased by 300,000 tons, which is equivalent to building three new factories;
   5. Accelerate the turnover of working capital. This year, the Northeast has achieved some results in this regard. We mainly strive in three aspects: reducing material reserves, accelerating the sale of finished products, and shortening the production process, in order to shorten the turnover period of working capital and save funds for the state;
   6. Reduce consumption norms. The consumption of raw materials, water, electricity, and labor for each unit of product should be reduced as much as possible, directly reducing costs;
   7. Improve labor organization and increase labor productivity and output;
   8. Improve quality. Under the strict implementation of operating procedures and inspection systems, improve quality, reduce defective products, which is to increase output;
   9. Reasonably use materials and reduce waste. In the planning and design work, we should adopt a highly responsible spirit towards planning and design work, based on the current situation of the country and future development, carefully study and consider in all aspects, not only to avoid technical errors, but also to avoid careless design or planning errors. A plan, if there is an error in the foundation, can cause irreparable losses. A point or a line on a design drawing can cause huge waste in construction projects. In the basic construction work, we should pay strict attention to the work of material supply, material quality, labor organization, and construction inspection. The quality of the project and the effect of construction depend on the construction. The basic construction work is done well, which can make the state investment produce its due effect, otherwise it will become a huge waste. In the scientific research work, we should arrange our research work around the center of increasing production and practicing thrift, combining with actual needs, so that our work can be combined with industrial production and have practical effects.

   Comrades, only we, the technical workers born in the era of Mao Zedong, have the opportunity to contribute our technology to the motherland without reservation. Let us unite and strive for the completion of this current huge task.

   To do the above various complex technical work well, we must combine with the masses. We must respond to Premier Zhou's call to learn Marxism-Leninism as concretized in China by Mao Zedong Thought. Most of us, the intellectuals in the scientific and technological field, have grown up in the old society, and each of us has, to a greater or lesser extent, the remnants of feudalism, capitalism, and old democratic thought in our ideology. We must seriously and systematically learn Mao Zedong Thought, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to carry out thorough ideological remolding, so that technology and politics can be combined, technology and the masses can be combined, and technology can better serve the people. Some people say that we, who study technology, specialize in studying technology and do not need to be concerned with politics, which may contribute more to the work. This view is wrong. Technical personnel must improve their political level to better serve the people with their technology.

   Comrades, having realized this, we must resolutely and seriously learn Mao Zedong Thought. Only the technical workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which is Marxism-Leninism concretized in China, can thoroughly remold themselves, improve themselves, and combine their technology with the masses, and undertake the great task of increasing production and practicing thrift called for by Chairman Mao.

   Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening speech that ideological remolding, first of all, the remolding of intellectuals, is an important condition for thoroughly carrying out democratic reforms in all aspects and gradually realizing industrialization in our country. Let us do a good job of this preparatory work for the industrialization of China under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

   Finally, I shout:

   Long live the Communist Party of China!
   Long live the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao!

   **Speech by Member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, Zhu Deshi (Korean)**

   **The Korean People in Northeast China Enthusiastically Launch Patriotic Production Competitions**

   Chairman, Commissioners, Comrades:

   At this meeting, after listening to Chairman Mao's opening speech and Premier Zhou's political report, I feel that this not only summarizes the great achievements of our great motherland under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government in the past year, but also clearly points out the direction for the future struggle for new and greater victories for all nationalities in the country. I represent the Korean people in Northeast China to express my complete agreement and strive for its realization.

   In the past two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have achieved great victories in political, national defense, economic, and cultural and educational construction. People's democratic dictatorship has been consolidated, and the entire Chinese mainland has been liberated. In the past year's movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the brave Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side with the brave Korean People's Army in Korean territory, smashed the arrogant aggression of American imperialism, and achieved great victories. This not only defended the safety of our great motherland but also defended the peace of the Far East and the world. These great victories of fact have proven one thing, that is, the policies, guidelines, and various measures of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government are completely correct and wise. We various nationalities will forever unite around Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Victory will always be ours, glory will always belong to the various nationalities of China, and happiness will be endless.

   In the past two years, the Korean people in Northeast China, under the correct implementation of the policy of national equality by the people's governments at various levels, have also achieved great successes in all aspects. Due to the vigorous launch of the production movement, production has quickly recovered and developed, and the living conditions of the Korean people have continued to improve. Taking the Yanbian area where most of the Korean people in Northeast China live as an example, 64.5% of the farmers have reached the living standard of middle farmers. With the improvement of economic life, cultural and educational work has also universally developed. The entire area has one university, two language specialized schools, one two-level normal school, one high school (currently rebuilding another high school), 24 junior high schools, 403 primary schools, an average of one primary school per administrative village, two junior high schools per district, an average of one university student per 1,076 people, three junior high school students per 35 people, and one primary school student per 5.5 people. The enrollment rate of school-age children is 93%, and 80,000 farmers have participated in farmers' schools. We have also established national newspapers, publishing houses, radio stations, and performing arts troupes. In some rural areas, village clubs, small libraries, and amateur drama troupes have been established, and the cultural life of the masses is becoming richer and richer, and the cultural level is improving day by day.

   Since American imperialism armedly invaded Korea, occupied our territory of Taiwan, approached our border, and continuously bombed and strafed cities and villages in Northeast China, the Korean people in Northeast China, like the people of various nationalities, have universally demanded to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, launching a wave of enlisting in the army and fighting in Korea, and carrying the call of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to the patriotic production front, launching a widespread mass patriotic production competition, and universally receiving patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, universally signing patriotic covenants, and launching donation movements and doing a good job in preferential treatment work. Taking the Yanbian area as an example, 700,000 people out of a population of 700,000 have received patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, 50% of the population have signed patriotic covenants, and the amount of increased production and donations has reached 670 million yuan. The patriotic production competition has greatly promoted the participation of women's labor force in the production front. For example, in Yanji County's Xing'an Village, the women's labor force has increased by 43.3%. The preferential treatment work has been universally carried out, and the system of contracted farming and contracted grain has been implemented. Through this magnificent movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the relationship between the Han and Korean nationalities has become more united, mutually supportive, and friendly.

   Although there are such achievements, we cannot be satisfied with them, nor can we ignore the shortcomings and problems that urgently need to be solved in various work due to the insufficient quantity and quality of national cadres. Among them, special attention should be paid to continuing to overcome narrow nationalism and strengthening internationalism and patriotism, continuing to thoroughly overcome formalism in signing patriotic covenants. This requires us to carefully study and conscientiously implement the guidelines for future national work mentioned in Premier Zhou's political report and the guidelines for the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea mentioned in Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report.

   At the same time, I enthusiastically respond to Premier Zhou's call to promote various organizations to study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. I think that studying the Selected Works of Mao Zedong well is the only way to overcome narrow nationalism and do a good job in the work of national regions. When we national cadres truly learn Mao Zedong Thought, we can say that the national problem within China has been finally solved!

   Finally, I am convinced that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, on the basis of the current friendship and unity of all nationalities, we will be more united, strive together, and resolutely implement and carry out the various tasks decided at this meeting. At the next meeting, we will definitely see our great motherland achieve even more brilliant victories!

   Long live the great unity of all nationalities in China!
   Long live the People's Republic of China!
   Long live Chairman Mao!

   **Speech by Deputy Chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Commission, Xiong Kewu**

   **Significant Achievements in Various Aspects of Work in Southwest China Over the Past Two Years**

   Chairman, Commissioners, Comrades:

   Attending this meeting, I have listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech and the reports from Premier Zhou, Vice Chairman Peng, Vice Premier Chen, and Vice Premier Guo on political, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, economic and financial, and cultural and educational work. These reports have pointed out the victories and achievements of the people's undertakings in various aspects over the past 16 months since the last meeting, as well as the tasks for various work in the future. All this is in line with the current situation of the country and the needs of the people. We enthusiastically support it and are willing to strive for its thorough implementation.

   Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and with the joint efforts of the Southwest Military and Political Commission and all levels of governments and the people, various work in the Southwest has achieved significant successes in the past year.

   In the land reform movement, the characteristic of the Southwest is that land is relatively concentrated, and feudal forces are relatively strong. If the preparatory work of eliminating bandits, suppressing local tyrants, reducing rent, and returning pledges is not done well, it is difficult to carry out land reform smoothly. The Southwest began this series of work last autumn and basically completed this series of struggle tasks this spring. This has stabilized the order in the countryside, and the peasants have obtained income equivalent to 75 billion catties of rice, improved their living conditions, increased their means of production, and raised their political awareness. On this basis of victory, we have carried out land reform in an orderly, step-by-step, and planned manner this spring. So far, after two phases of work, land reform has been successfully completed in areas with about 35 million agricultural population in the entire region. From the two phases of land reform, it can be seen that land reform is a fierce class struggle, and peaceful resolution is impossible. Now the third phase of work has begun, and it is planned that by this winter and next spring, except for some minority areas, land reform will continue to be completed in areas with more than 30 million agricultural population, and land reform in the entire region is expected to be basically completed.

   Due to the completion of land reform work, the face of the vast countryside has been fundamentally changed: the land ownership system of feudal exploitation by the landlord class has been abolished, the peasants have stood up and become the masters, obtained land, not only their political awareness has been improved, but also on the land they obtained, they have worked hard to increase production, actively donated, and enlisted in the army to support the great struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

   The Southwest is the last stronghold of the Kuomintang and American bandits, who have deployed a large number of spies and bandits and have closely colluded with the original feudal forces; therefore, after liberation, they organized rebellions and carried out various sabotage activities, causing endless disasters to the people of the Southwest. Since the Central People's Government issued the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, cities and villages have mobilized more than 80% of the masses to launch a comprehensive campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The ringleaders, local tyrants, spies, key figures of counter-revolutionary parties and groups, and leaders of counter-revolutionary sects have basically been severely suppressed and punished as they deserve. This has made the social order in the Southwest present an unprecedented stable situation. But the remnants of counter-revolutionary forces have not been completely and thoroughly eliminated, and they need to be further deeply suppressed in the future.

   The development of the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the Southwest has expanded from various central cities to the vast countryside and remote areas, quickly spreading throughout the region, with an unprecedented scale. By the beginning of May this year, more than 80% of the urban population and about 60% of the rural population have received new patriotic propaganda. In the entire region, 28,280,000 people participated in the May Day patriotic demonstration, 45,570,000 people signed to demand that the five major powers sign a peace treaty, and 42,550,000 people voted against the American arming of Japan. After the returning volunteers and the delegation visiting Korea reported to the people of various places, it has become more widespread and in-depth.

   Especially after the Resistance and Aid Korea Association issued the three major calls to promote patriotic covenants, donate airplanes and cannons, and take care of the families of martyrs and soldiers, the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the Southwest has further developed. The people have, on the basis of patriotic production, already pledged to donate 209 airplanes, 19 cannons, and 12 anti-aircraft guns. The collection of funds in various places is extremely enthusiastic. For example, the Northern Sichuan Administrative Office has pledged to donate 27 fighter planes, but the amount of funds collected has far exceeded the amount pledged. In rural areas, factories, cities, and various ethnic minority areas, the promotion of signing patriotic covenants has been universal, strengthening the unity and enthusiasm of the people; for any undertaking and movement, they have shown high enthusiasm and efficiency with practical actions. The people of the Southwest are displaying their great power in this movement.

   The progress of these three movements is interrelated, and similarly, other reforms and construction are inseparable from these three movements. In terms of finance and economy: although the Southwest is known as a rich region, it has been long exploited and plundered by the Kuomintang bandits, and the people's lives and production have fallen into difficulties. After liberation, the financial work has firmly implemented the correct policy of "reorganizing income, economizing expenditure, concentrating management, and coordinating support" of the Central Government, basically maintaining a balance between income and expenditure, stabilizing prices; and it has adapted to the needs of economic construction, and has started some enterprises and undertakings with focus.

   In terms of taxation: for example, agricultural tax is linked with the land reform of investigating land and assessing production, making the burden relatively fair and reasonable; for urban taxes, it is through the call of patriotism to challenge and compete among industrial and commercial people, to expose tax evasion, collectively pay to the treasury, and calculate and levy taxes according to the rate.

   In terms of economic undertakings: agricultural production has gradually increased since liberation, and this year, a large-scale land reform has further increased production. For example, industrial raw materials such as cotton have reached 152% of the pre-war production, sugarcane has reached 82%, and grain crops have reached 87.7%, all approaching or exceeding the pre-war level.

   In terms of industrial production: due to the improvement and adjustment of state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, they have quickly recovered, and some have developed significantly. For example, taking the highest annual production before liberation as the base number, looking at the production index of various industries in the first half of this year, iron, coal, salt, sugar, and 11 other items have not yet recovered to the pre-war level, but have increased significantly compared to last year; while steel, copper, electricity, cement, and 7 other items have far exceeded the previous highest level. Achieving such achievements is not only due to the progress of various economic undertakings, but also due to the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, calling for patriotic production competitions, workers proposing numerous rationalization suggestions, universally improving labor productivity, and creating huge wealth. This not only increases production but also strengthens the industrial organization, creating favorable conditions for the development of the new China's economy, gradually moving towards the new track of large-scale production with planning.

   In terms of transportation and trade: after the liberation of the Southwest, the first thing was to start the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which immediately drove the development of many industries, especially the steel industry; now 270 kilometers of track have been laid, and trains have started running. In addition, repairing the highways in the entire region and improving inland water transportation have played a huge role in the exchange of materials between regions and between cities and villages. The major cities in the entire region have also become prosperous. State-owned trade organizations have 1,074 branches distributed in major cities throughout the region and most counties and cities; they are being added one after another. Private industrial and commercial enterprises in major cities have increased significantly, and in Chongqing alone, 13,235 new businesses have been opened from January to August this year. The market demand is increasing, and industrial and agricultural products are in short supply, fully showing the healthy development of the economy in the entire region.

   In terms of education and culture: higher education has carried out several reforms to achieve the consistency of learning and application, theory and practice, to meet the needs of national construction. Primary and secondary education has been reorganized, and the number of students has increased. The number of students in primary schools has increased to 5 million. The number of students in workers' and peasants' supplementary education has also increased significantly. As for news, publishing, performing arts, broadcasting, and other cultural undertakings, they have made significant progress; in terms of health work, medical teams and mobile medical teams have been specially organized to go to the old revolutionary base areas and ethnic minority areas to treat and focus on prevention and have achieved considerable effects. Education and cultural undertakings are urgently needed at present, and we are currently preparing conditions to promote the construction of these undertakings.

   In terms of ethnic work: under the call of Chairman Mao and the correct implementation of the ethnic policy, discrimination and estrangement among various nationalities have been eliminated, and various nationalities have united unprecedentedly. Under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, with the efforts of the troops entering Tibet and the support of the Tibetan people, Tibet has been peacefully liberated, making Tibet return to the big family of the motherland, completing the unprecedented unification of the motherland on the Asian continent, bringing great joy and encouragement to the people of the entire country and the various nationalities in the Southwest.

   In the ethnic minority areas of the Southwest, many have established their own governments, establishing autonomous governments of various ethnic groups and united governments in ethnic mixed areas at the prefecture, county, district, and township levels. They are managing all affairs of their own ethnic groups under the help of the people's government according to their own wishes. To help the people of various ethnic groups develop production and improve their lives, on the one hand, trade organizations for ethnic minorities have been established, equal exchange has been implemented, a large number of local specialties have been purchased, and living necessities have been supplied; on the other hand, transportation, water conservancy, animal husbandry, reclamation, and other undertakings have been carried out, and these have achieved considerable results. Three ethnic colleges and many cadre training schools have been established, with a total of more than 10,000 ethnic youth participating in the study. Therefore, we see that the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the ethnic minority areas is also being enthusiastically carried out, just like in other areas.

   In general, although various work has achieved considerable success, errors and shortcomings also exist, and they need to be corrected in future work. This meeting's call to strengthen the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and increasing production and practicing thrift is extremely correct, and we will therefore anticipate that the construction of various aspects of our country will be quickly launched. We feel extremely happy and excited and will strive to learn Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution combined with Mao Zedong Thought, respond to Premier Zhou's call, take on the responsibility of promoting various organizations to study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong; with various democratic classes, various democratic parties, various nationalities, and various sectors of the people, unite with Mao Zedong Thought. We guarantee to thoroughly complete the current tasks and march towards the great future!

   **Speech by Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, Li Dequan**

   **Strive for Further Improvement of the People's Health Level**

   Chairman, Commissioners, Comrades:

   In the past two years since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the health condition of the Chinese people has undergone significant changes. We have basically changed the situation in the old China where epidemics were rampant and the vast majority of people had no medical care, and have initially improved the health level of the people. Based on the health policy of the Common Program and the needs of the people of the entire country, we have determined the general policy of "prevention first," "facing workers, peasants, and soldiers," and "uniting traditional and Western medicine" for the reform and development of the health cause, and have determined the prevention and treatment of major diseases that harm people's health as our main task. This is an arduous task because the health condition of the people in the old China was too miserable, the health cause was too weak, and the distribution of health institutions and personnel was too unreasonable. In the old China, the vast majority of laboring people had no health guarantee, especially in the vast rural areas, there was basically no health work. Therefore, witch doctors were rampant, killing people and making money; highly contagious diseases such as plague, smallpox, cholera, etc., were rampant every year, and the number of people dying from these diseases every year was countless; other infectious diseases such as typhoid, dysentery, black fever, malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, venereal diseases, and parasitic diseases such as filariasis, schistosomiasis, and hookworm disease were also spreading, with no one taking care of them. During the reactionary rule, the death rate of the people of the entire country was estimated to be about 30 per thousand, and more than half of them died from preventable infectious diseases. The infant mortality rate in some areas was as high as 40% or more. Some ethnic minority areas had a significant reduction in population, such as the Ikh Khoshuu League, which had 400,000 people at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, now has less than 100,000 people, a reduction of 75%.

   In view of this situation, in the past two years, based on the above-mentioned policies and tasks, we have carried out the following work:

   1. Strengthen epidemic prevention work. To prevent the annual outbreak of smallpox nationwide, we have vaccinated 200 million people with cowpox. In Beijing, Dalian, Guangzhou, and many other cities, there have been no smallpox patients since last May. We plan to vaccinate the entire country with cowpox once in the next two years and strive to basically eradicate smallpox.

   To control the spread of plague, we have established prevention and treatment stations in plague-stricken areas such as Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Yunnan, mobilizing the masses to catch rats and kill fleas, and carrying out preventive injections. We have basically controlled the plague in Inner Mongolia and other areas and reduced the incidence rate in Northeast China and other areas. From January to June this year, the number of plague patients nationwide has decreased by about 80% compared to the same period last year.

   To stop the spread of cholera and other infectious diseases, we have restored and established 16 quarantine stations for transportation to prevent cholera from entering the country. We have carried out water disinfection and improved environmental sanitation in key areas; in the past two years, we have carried out cholera preventive injections for 30 million people, and therefore, we have not found a single true cholera patient in the past three years.

   To mobilize epidemic prevention forces, we have organized 125 epidemic prevention teams nationwide, and 6,000 health workers have gone deep into disaster areas, epidemic areas, and the Huai River flood control project areas to carry out mass epidemic prevention work, preventing typhus, relapsing fever, typhoid, and dysentery from breaking out. We have established 8 black fever prevention and treatment stations, treating 110,000 black fever patients. We have established 18 parasitic disease prevention and treatment stations to carry out regular prevention and treatment work. In ethnic minority areas, we have carried out the work of eradicating syphilis, preventing malaria, and maternal and child health care. The syphilis prevention and treatment work in some areas of Inner Mongolia has achieved results, and the birth rate has increased. In addition, to strengthen the supply of vaccines and sera, we have expanded 7 biological product factories, and the production of vaccines and sera has exceeded ten times that of the reactionary rule.

   2. Restore and develop grassroots health organizations. At present, 85% of the counties nationwide have established health stations, totaling 1,865. The task of the health stations is to undertake epidemic prevention, health care, medical treatment, and training of district and village health personnel. The number of beds in health stations has increased by 122% compared to before liberation, and 1,498 district health stations have been established in the form of public assistance. In industrial and mining areas, there is an average of one doctor for every 880 workers, and in the industrial and mining areas of Northeast China, there is an average of one health worker for every 115 workers. In ethnic minority areas such as Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, there are already 92 health stations and 24 hospitals. We plan to establish grassroots health organizations in every county, district, factory, and mine nationwide in five to six years. In addition, the number of hospital beds in cities has also increased, with an increase of 26% this year compared to last year.

   3. Mobilize all medical forces to serve the motherland. Through patriotic education, the political awareness of health workers nationwide has been greatly improved. Many cities have organized health and medical committees to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and many medical and health workers have participated in the volunteer work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; private practitioners participating in public health institutions have also gradually increased; some private practitioners have organized joint hospitals and clinics and have begun to participate in local epidemic prevention and health care work. The unity between traditional and Western medicine has also been strengthened, and about 180,000 traditional doctors in many cities have been organized, and some cities have even established joint organizations of traditional and Western medicine. To make traditional medicine play a more effective role, local traditional medicine advanced study schools and advanced classes have been established in 57 places, so that traditional doctors can obtain basic scientific medical knowledge. In terms of maternal and child health care work, we have cooperated with the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and other mass organizations to vigorously transform traditional midwives and promote new methods of childbirth; we have transformed about 100,000 traditional midwives; we have restored and established nearly 1,000 maternal and child health institutions and more than 10,000 childbirth stations, significantly reducing the death rate of newborns from tetanus.

   4. Train a large number of high, middle, and primary health cadres. At present, the number of doctors in our country is too small, and to solve the urgent and large-scale demand for cadres, we must reform the past medical education system. Therefore, we advocate that higher medical colleges adopt the system of specialized focus and shorten the study period. This education system has already created some initial successful experience. In medical colleges, we have attached specialized advanced courses, and in various places, we have newly established medical assistant schools and expanded midwifery schools and medical assistant schools to train intermediate medical personnel. In addition, we have opened a large number of short-term training classes to train primary health personnel in epidemic prevention, emergency treatment, and health care. At present, there are 25,000 students in higher medical schools and more than 50,000 students in middle-level medical schools.

   5. Strive for self-sufficiency in medicines and medical equipment. After two years of efforts, the self-sufficiency rate of medicines and medical equipment has reached 48%, but some commonly used special medicines and precision instruments still need to be imported from abroad. We are planning to develop the pharmaceutical industry, expand the production of medicines and equipment, and first strive for self-sufficiency in sulfonamides, antimalarial drugs, anesthetics, etc., and partial self-sufficiency in penicillin, DDT, etc.

   6. In carrying out the above work, the health department has obtained a good assistant, the Red Cross Society of China. As is known, before liberation, the Red Cross Society of China was controlled by the reactionary rulers and was corrupt. But after the reorganization last year, under the leadership of the people's government, it has a new face. Based on the policy of "mobilizing the people to save themselves and others" and the policy of "prevention first" in health work, it has successively organized seven international medical and prevention service teams with 600 people to go to the front and rear of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to carry out medical and prevention work. During this period, it has also organized more than 300 medical and prevention service teams to carry out medical and prevention work in the Huai River flood control project areas and disaster areas, reorganized 38 branches, and organized these branches and branches that have not been reorganized but have business units to cooperate with local governments and civil affairs and health departments to do some health treatment work, sharing the heavy burden of ensuring the health of the people in production and construction. Now the society, in addition to continuing to organize forces to actively participate in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and disaster relief, is also vigorously promoting emergency education and emergency work and school health—Red Cross youth work with relevant departments and organizations. However, this mass health and relief organization is a newly born organization, and we hope everyone will give more guidance and help.

   In the past two years, although some work has been done in the health field, these efforts are still far from meeting the medical and health needs of the vast majority of people. Due to the improvement of the people's economic life, the demand for health and hygiene will inevitably increase. To make the health cause meet the needs of the vast majority of people, we still need all public and private health personnel to unite and organize more closely under the leadership of the government to serve the motherland. We also ask all institutions, organizations, and people from all walks of life to assist the health department to jointly promote the people's health cause, attach importance to this work related to the health and life of the people. We will, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, further strive to improve the health condition of the people and improve the health level of the people.

    人民政协全国委员会第三次会议二十九日会上的专题报告和发言
    编者按：在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议十月二十九日会上作专题报告和发言的有陈毅、杜平、李书城、章蕴、李顺达、郭树德、鲍尔汉、崔玉振、王之玺、朱德海、熊克武、李德全等十二人。他们的报告和发言如下：
    华东军政委员会委员陈毅发言
    掌握思想领导运用自我批评武器做好工作毛主席、各位副主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    一、为执行毛主席的指示和全国委员会的各项决议而奋斗
    我代表华东行政区和上海市完全同意毛主席的开会词，完全同意周总理的政治报告，完全同意陈叔通副主席的会务报告，彭真副主席的抗美援朝报告，陈副总理的财经报告，郭副总理的文教报告。
    毛主席的开会词，正确地提出了保卫和平，反对侵略，办理建设的方针，同时又指出为了继续坚持反侵略的正义斗争，全国人民必须继续作抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。抗美援朝的伟大斗争，必须进行到美国政府愿意和平解决的时候为止。周总理的报告和其他几位的报告是根据毛主席的指示作了说明，并具体规定了各项工作任务。我认为毛主席的指示和各项报告，完全符合国内外的政治形势，并正确表达出全国人民的反对侵略、力争和平、渴望建设的伟大心愿。我们华东人民愿为实现毛主席的指示和全国委员会的各项决议而坚持奋斗。我们除了继续把土地改革完成，把镇压反革命工作彻底做好，继续修治淮河外，在今冬和明年一定要集中力量去进行增加生产、厉行节约和思想改造几项中心任务。
    一年来在华东各方面的工作都有迅速而巨大的成就。我在此将华东和上海的工作向大会作简要的报告：
    二、华东的抗美援朝工作
    抗美援朝运动使华东百分之八十以上的人民受到爱国主义教育，基本上扫除了亲美、崇美、恐美的思想，发扬了爱国主义与国际主义精神。全区有六千三百万人签名于斯德哥尔摩宣言；一亿五千九百九十三万人签名投票拥护缔结和平公约，反对美国武装日本；七十万工农子弟参加部队；二十四万学生与青年工人踊跃报名参加军事干部学校；四千六百万人参加今年“五一”示威大游行，上海参加的人数在二百四十万人以上，约占全市人口的半数。各区募集了六百七十亿人民币及大批衣物信件，慰问中、朝战士，救护朝鲜难民。汽车司机、医务工作者及广大民工组织起来，一批接着一批奔向朝鲜前线服务。迄十月十日止，华东人民共认捐飞机八百九十七架，大炮三十三门，高射炮十七门，坦克三辆，占全国认捐数的三分之一；迄十月二十日为止，华东已缴款八千七百四十亿元，达认捐总额百分之六十二，上海市工商界与广大工人共同协议进行增产国防捐献，原定捐献四千○五十亿元买飞机二百七十架，得本月二十六日电话报告已缴款四千三百亿，超过原任务。捐献运动仍在继续，准备争取达到三百架飞机。各地对优抚工作十分重视，“八
    一”前后广泛进行了慰问，并深入检查，加强这一工作的经常性与群众性。华东抗美援朝工作的具体经验是：第一，凡将抗美援朝列为政治动员的中心，有组织、有步骤坚持去进行的地方，则一切工作最易于推动，最能启发人民中间的积极性。反之，仅将抗美援朝工作孤立进行，或仅视为一项宣传任务去进行的地方，则各项工作的推动会是很迟缓的；第二，一年来抗美援朝在前线的胜利和后方的推动力量，逐渐说服了过去对抗美援朝抱疑惧态度与持反对态度的人们，这样，不仅提高了思想，而且增进了团结，强有力的推动了工作。毛主席号召我们继续作抗美援朝工作，我们完全接受，准备在一九五二年使抗美援朝的爱国主义运动有更大的开展。
    三、华东的土地改革工作
    山东、苏北、苏南、皖南四地区已完成了土地分配，浙江完成了百分之九十二，福建完成了百分之六十五，皖北完成了百分之五十，上海市郊区土地改革自今年春季开始，本月底即可结束。总计华东已有百分之八十六·一的农业地区，约一亿五百万农业人口，完成了土地分配，其余地区明年春季以前亦可全部完成。在土地改革运动中，各省（区）、市相继组织了各民主党派、各人民团体及工商界人士下乡参观或参加工作，上海及苏南合办土地改革展览会，分在上海、无锡等市展出，使城市人民更清楚地了解了封建地主的罪恶和农民的正义行动，正确认识土地改革运动的意义。华东的土地改革尚未全部完成，因而尚不是作总结的时候，但可以指出一点：即过去对土地改革抱怀疑态度的人，预言土地改革会搞乱社会秩序的人，不相信土地改革之后将推动工商业发展的人，现在看见土地改革的伟大成就，也开始改变自己的错误观点与错误态度。仅就这一点上来说，土地改革的实际教育意义就非常之大。
    四、华东的镇压反革命工作
    华东人民在“大张旗鼓，严厉镇压反革命运动”中，热烈检举，控诉了反革命分子的罪行。各地人民政府先后举办了反动党、团、特务分子的登记；在调查研究、掌握材料后，对罪恶重大或继续活动的反革命分子，进行了逮捕。反革命案件的审理，一般由各界人民代表会议协商委员会组织反革命案件审查委员会或清理案件委员会，协助公安、司法机关，慎重进行。经大力清理，各地杀人、抢劫、放火、强奸的惯匪、土匪头子，血债累累的恶霸，有人证物证的国民党特务负责分子，有证据的反动党团的积极反革命分子及反动道会门头子，均依法处决，而判处徒刑的反革命罪犯正由各地组织劳动改造。经过这一运动，反革命分子气焰大降，人民正气伸张，人民民主专政的基础大为加强，社会秩序大为安定。过去上海抢劫盗窃案件甚多，本年六月份仅发生盗案三起，七月份只一起，八月份未发生盗案。我们在华东地区大力进行了剿匪工作，从一九四九年冬到今年六月底止，共歼灭土匪特务武装二十二万三千一百八十七人，大陆上土匪基本肃清。福建过去土匪横行，现在人民安居乐业，为空前未有的现象。从镇压反革命的初步经验看来，证明潜伏在各地的反革命分子确实不少；证明反革命的各项活动确实是很积极的；证明给反革命活动以严厉镇压实属必要，切不可迟疑和动摇，最后，这次镇压反革命的工作确实做得很正确、很有力量。但应指出，反革命尚未完全肃清，我们必须继续贯彻镇压反革命的工作。
    五、华东工商业情况与工农
    生活
    这一年来华东工商业已大为好转。工人生产积极性与创造性不断提高，普遍展开了爱国主义生产竞赛，生产效率和产量显著增加。以比重占全国百分之七十的华东纺织业为例，今年上半年上海国营厂的每月产量，和解放前最高水平比较，纱超过百分之十六·九，布超过百分之五十一·三，钢铁、机械、电器、工具、橡胶、造纸、卷烟、火柴等生产都比去年上升。许多过去国内不能制造的工业原料、机器、工具、精密仪器等一部分有了新创造。私营工商业在政府的指导与帮助下，一般由恢复走向发展。今年一月至八月，上海批准开业的工厂八百四十家，停业的仅一百七十家；批准开业的商店一万二千七百六十四家，歇业的仅九百七十三家；开歇相抵，共实增一万二千四百六十一家。自今年二月至六月，华东各省（区）市及百分之六十以上的专区、县，都举行了土产会议与展览。上海在六月间举行的华东土特产展览交流大会，历时两月，观众三百余万人，会上成交金额达六千六百余亿元，对土产交流起了很大的作用。各业市场出现了淡季不淡，旺季更旺的现象，许多工业品都供不应求。工商业的情况，现正趋于更大的好转与繁荣。
    在贯彻倚靠工人阶级的政策下，我们一面发挥了工人阶级的伟大智慧和力量，一面也首先照顾了工人阶级的利益。实施劳动保险条例后，华东已有工人及其家属一百四十万人获得了劳保利益。上海市政建设，明确了“为生产服务，为劳动人民服务，首先为工人阶级服务”的方针，在工人居住最密集的地区，如沪东提蓝桥区虹镇和沪西普陀区石灰窑两处，重点改善了道路及下水道工程，在普陀区有系统地规划兴建工人住宅和水电工程。其他公共建筑、公用和文教卫生等事业也都有了为工人阶级服务的成绩。
    对农业生产，我们颁布了农业生产十大政策，在各地贯彻执行，并大力兴修水利，抗旱排洪，除虫防病，战胜自然灾害，取得了去秋与今年的丰收。一九五○年全华东粮食产量约合抗日战争前百分之八十二·五，今年包括秋收在内，将合抗日战争前百分之九十二·六以上。主要工业原料的产量，棉花今年估计比一九五○年增加约百分之五十。黄麻、洋麻、烤烟叶、蚕茧等产量也大有增加。在毛主席亲自倡议“一定要把淮河修好”的口号下，我们对连年为灾的淮河，自去年冬季起，动员了广大干部和二百多万民工，大力修治，今年七月如期完成了第一期工程，安度夏汛，使沿淮各地获得了十年来的第一次丰收。土地改革及丰收之后，农民生活得到了改善，生产积极性更加提高。“劳动发家，爱国增产”的口号已深入农村。在“组织起来”的方针下，农民互助组和农村合作社的组织大大发展了。
    在工商业活动方面，尚存在着盲目现象与许多不利于全局的自私行为，这只有从提高与逐步加强经济方面的计划性才能达到统筹兼顾的目的。公营与私营的关系应该在承认公营领导的原则下举行相互检讨去纠正妨碍全局与大计的片面行为和自私行为，华东各地特别是上海市应该专门组织财经工作者与工商界来学习陈云主任的关于经济工作与财政工作的报告，掌握这个报告作为调整公私关系，管理市场，保持物价稳定，争取国家经济继续好转的武器。
    华东军政委员会委员陈毅发言
    掌握思想领导运用自我批评武器做好工作
    六、华东的文教工作
    随着城乡经济的恢复与发展，人民文教卫生事业也有空前进步。从一九五○年下半年到今年上半年，小学生由六百四十九万六千五百○五人增为八百八十七万六千四百五十七人，增加百分之三十五；中学生由三十七万三千八百○七人增为四十四万三千八百五十三人；大专学生由三万四千四百三十三人增为四万一千○八十六人，均增加百分之二十。今年秋季开学，各级学校都增班增额，学生增加得更多；工农子弟入学的比例也较前更大。农民参加冬学人数，由一九四九年的三百六十万人增为
    一九五○年的七百十六万人，其中有三百二十七万人转入常年民校。估计今年冬学人数将增至一千五百万人，其中有六百万人转入常年民校。职工补习学校，各地普遍开办，上海更开设夜中学及晚班小学，使在业职工及失学儿童多得受教育的机会，为消灭文盲运动作了基础。各地防治时疫和地方病的工作普遍展开，上海并动员大批医务工作者，协助郊区驻军，防治吸血虫病，获得了很大的成绩。在
    “预防为主”的方针下，华东普遍进行了各种防疫工作，解放以来，各大城市未发生霍乱等时疫，过去盛行于鲁南、苏北的黑热病和江南一带的吸血虫病，大大减少。其他文化、艺术、科学普及、新闻出版、广播等工作，贯彻面向工农兵的方针，也广泛收到了政治思想教育的效果。特别是在“武训传”电影受到批评、检讨后，加强了对文艺思想政治的领导，进一步明确了文艺工作的前进方向，大大帮助了今后的正确发展。十月十二日华东一百七十个新华书店分支机构同时发行了“毛泽东选集”，各界人民争先购买，上海一天内即售完并预约了三万册，打破以往任何书籍的发行纪录。
    今年一月以来，华东各地登记了接受外资津贴的各级学校六百七十七所及其他文化、医疗机关四百十二所（其中受美国津贴的学校三百二十七所，文化、医疗机关二百十二所），并积极进行处理工作。宗教界以南京上海两地为中心，广泛开展三自运动，清除了大批隐藏在宗教外衣下的帝国主义分子，取缔了天主教教务协进会及“圣母军”等反动特务组织，基本上肃清了帝国主义的文化侵略势力，收回了文化教育主权，并实现了真正的宗教信仰自由。
    文教工作的首要是思想改造工作，这方面在华东和上海的成就不如京津两地能更直接得到中央的领导和启示，一年多来成就不算很大，但抗美援朝的时事教育则作得多，成绩比较显著。与镇压反革命工作和土地改革工作联系进行的政策教育亦是有成绩的，但对学习马列主义毛泽东思想最基本的政治思想的教育方面则做得很不够，这是今后工作的新的方面，要以更大的力量去进行。
    七、民主建政
    通过上述各项工作，人民政治觉悟显著提高，人民团体组织日益扩大与加强，民主政权建设工作也就跃进一步。华东省一级单位，除福建外，都召开过人民代表会议，一般代行了人民代表大会职权。县一级单位根据今年一月至八月统计，有百分之九十四召开了人民代表会议，其中八个市三个县代行了人民代表大会职权。大城市大都开过区的人民代表会议，上海并开过两次市、区人民代表联席会。各级人民代表会议已建立协商委员会或常务委员会，加强日常工作。人民代表的产生，大都采取了选举或推选的方式。上海市第二届人民代表会议代表八百二十三人中，有百分之九十六点五由选举或推选产生。此外，各省（区）先后展开调整区、乡，加强基层政权的工作，部分地区已召开乡人民代表会议，选举了乡人民政府。两年来华东的政权工作在建立机构，掌握与学习民主协商方式，准备与召开各级人民代表会议，清理内部，整编机关，各方面的工作是有成绩的。在抗美援朝的群众动员中，证明了各级人民政府确实取得人民的拥护，与人民联系是日益加强的。在领导土地改革与镇压反革命两大运动中，一面证明了人民政府与人民的密切联系，一面又证明了人民政府确有能力去贯彻其政策，对任何反革命活动，均有能力号召群众予以坚决的镇压。这是倚靠毛主席与中央人民政府的正确领导，倚靠广大人民的支持，倚靠各民主党派的团结与努力去获得的。
    今后华东政权工作的任务是注意许多接管机关的审查与清理，组织各级机关干部的整风学习。并与上述两点结合来进行机关的整编与精简，一般注意改进领导作风去增强与人民的联系。召开各级人民代表会议和协商委员会，切实讨论执行抗美援朝与增产节约的中心任务。
    八、争取一九五二年的工作比今年做得更好
    我将华东过去一年的工作作了简要的报告，工作上的成绩是由于毛主席、中共中央和中央人民政府的正确领导，由于人民支持，党派团结和我们自己努力而获得的，但其中毛主席的正确领导这一条是极其重要的带决定性的条件，没有这个条件我们是会犯错误的，有了毛主席的正确领导，我们即使犯错误也因能得到提醒而迅速纠正，因此我们工作上的勇气是很高的，信心是很大的。我们对自己工作中的主要缺点——联系群众与了解情况均尚不够以及其他的缺点与错误——采取自我批评与严加纠正的态度，这样便对任何缺点与错误是能够很迅速纠正的。我们能善于掌握思想领导和运用自我批评的武器，严正的、认真的对待工作，我们当然有能力、有指望把一九五二年的工作做得比一九五一年更好些！
    人民志愿军代表杜平发言
    坚决秉承祖国人民意志一定要战胜敌人主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我作为中国人民志愿军的一个代表，首先对毛主席的开会词、周总理的政治报告、陈叔通副主席的会务报告、彭真副主席关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告、陈云副总理关于经济工作和财政工作的报告、郭沫若副总理关于文化教育工作的报告，表示热烈地拥护，并准备在志愿军中作为学习文件进行学习。
    从报告中我们了解到伟大的祖国，经过抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，及西藏问题的和平解决，已经实现了空前未有的统一，全国人民空前团结，国防力量大大增强，金融物价继续保持稳定，经济建设和文化事业不断发展，人民民主专政的政权也更进一步地巩固了。这些巨大成就使我们国家气象一新，这次我们战斗英雄代表团亲眼看到了祖国各方面欣欣向荣的气象，感到非常兴奋，更增加了我们在朝鲜作战的勇气和信心。请让我代表正在朝鲜前线作战的志愿军全体同志向领导我们国家走向胜利走向繁荣的伟大领袖毛主席致最崇高的敬礼！
    一年来抗美援朝保家卫国运动的胜利是在前线和后方相互鼓舞相互配合下取得的，国内的胜利和朝鲜前线的胜利又是相互辉映的。全国人民正为这个伟大的胜利而欢呼。
    现在我把朝鲜前线的情况简单地向大会报告一下。
    毛主席在这次会议的开会词中说：“如果不是美国军队占领我国的台湾。侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和打到了我国的东北边疆，中国人民是不会和美国军队作战的。但是既然美国侵略者已经向我们进攻了，我们就不能不举起反侵略的旗帜”。一年以前，中国人民志愿军就在这种形势下出现在朝鲜战场上与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的，到现在已经整整一年了。
    过去这一年的确是艰苦的一年，又是伟大胜利的一年。我军在朝鲜战场上曾经遇到许多的困难。但是我们并没有在困难面前低过头。我们依靠了自己的勇敢和智慧，一面作战，一面学习，创造了各种克服困难的办法，并以极度的坚毅精神忍受了许多难以想像的艰苦，但终于克服了困难，获得了胜利。我们的装备不如敌人，但是由于我们所进行的战争是正义的反侵略的战争，我军的每一个成员都具有高度的爱国主义与国际主义思想，在战斗中表现了坚决顽强奋不顾身的精神，因而战胜了装备优良的美国侵略军。
    一年来中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军联合进行了五个大规模的战役，把战线从鸭绿江边推到三八线，并在三八线地区进行了坚强的阻击战与局部的反击战，使敌人付出了重大的代价。据不完全统计歼灭敌人三十八万七千余人，击毁击伤敌人飞机二千三百多架，消耗了敌人大量的弹药物资，并使侵略者陷于他们所最感头痛的长期消耗战中。
    这一个辉煌的胜利，不仅打乱了美帝国主义狂妄的侵略计划，奠定了中朝人民反侵略战争胜利的基础，巩固了我们祖国的国防，而且对全世界人民的和平民主事业作出了极大的贡献，对东方各被压迫民族的解放斗争也是极大的鼓舞。一年来的事实证明，武器装备的优劣，并不能决定战争的胜负，而战争的正义的性质，才是获得胜利的决定因素。
    志愿军这一年来的胜利是与祖国人民的强大支援和朝鲜人民的直接帮助分不开的，祖国四亿七千五百万人民以全力支援了我们在朝鲜的作战，许多工人农民表示朝鲜战场上需要什么就给什么，要人有人，要钱有钱，我们十分满意祖国人民对我们这种有求必应的支援。这次会议上又通过了关于抗美援朝工作的决议，使朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利更加有了保证。因此我们向全国人民、向各民主党派、各人民团体及各界爱国人士表示衷心的感谢。同时，我们朝鲜前线的部队也要普遍地进行节约运动，克服浪费现象，使前方的一切人力、物力、财力都能得到合理地使用，使祖国人民所支援我们的每一分力量，都能在争取战争的胜利中充分发挥其作用。
    一年来，我们与敌人进行了艰苦的激烈的作战，其中有进攻，有防御，有运动战，有阻击战，也有连续突破筑城地带的阵地攻击战。因而使我军取得了与美国侵略军作战的丰富经验，学会了一套以劣势装备战胜近代化装备敌人的本领，我军在军事工作、政治工作、后勤工作、运输工作各方面都有了新的发展，在组织机构上，工作方法上也更加适合于当前战争的要求，这些经验是最为宝贵的，有了这些经验，我们战胜敌人就更有把握，更有保证。我军在战术指挥上已有很大的进步，各级指挥员都逐渐学会了掌握战争的规律，学会了联合兵种的指挥和行政管理，并能很好地掌握通讯联络。我军在装备上已有飞跃的改进，在技术上也有显著的提高。由于我军防空武器的日益加强，因而击落击伤敌人的飞机的数目就大大增加，今年夏季，每月平均可击落击伤敌机一百余架，而到秋季，每月平均可击落击伤敌机二百架到三百架。随着我军炮火的加强，对敌人的杀伤也大大地增加，从去年十月二十五日到今年五月二十一日的五个战役中敌人平均每天伤亡九百零四名强，在五月二十二日到九月二十四日敌人的所谓夏季攻势中平均每天伤亡一千二百九十一名，在九月二十五日到十月十日敌人的所谓秋季攻势的头十六天中敌人平均每天伤亡一千九百一十八人；而在十月十三日至十五日的三天中，敌人的伤亡率更达到每天五千六百余人的最高纪录，这就使敌人向我们进攻而要付出更大的代价，这样大量的人力的消耗，美帝国主义是无法长期支持的。我军在后勤工作和运输工作上，也积累了许多好的经验，并有许多新的创造。最近一个时期，敌机对我后方的袭扰虽然并未减弱，但我们的损失却大大地减少了。因而保证了粮弹的供应，并使前线的部队早已穿上新的棉衣。卫生设备也有极大的改善。一年来我军所有的部队和各个工作部门，都在爱国主义与国际主义思想的基础上，发扬了高度的革命英雄主义。全体指战员都以为祖国人民，为朝鲜人民和全世界人民立功是最大的光荣。因而在每次战斗和每个工作任务中，都出现了大批的英雄、模范，在他们的影响和推动之下，全军的战斗情绪和工作热情不断地高涨。总之，目前我全军兵员充足，士气旺盛，战斗力空前提高。由于我们具有这样强大的力量，因而全体指战员都充满了胜利的信心。
    目前朝鲜战争正在继续进行，敌人还没有表示和平的诚意。我们特向大会表示：我们认清了全国人民所交给我们抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务是光荣的伟大的，我们决心继续秉承祖国人民的意志与侵略者战斗到底，不管前面还有多少困难，战争如何艰苦，我们当以最大的毅力克服困难，我们一定要战胜敌人，保护我们美好的伟大的祖国，保卫东方与世界和平。让我们高呼：
    强大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    光荣的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中朝人民战斗的兄弟友谊万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    中央人民政府农业部部长李书城发言
    为开展更大规模的爱国增产运动而奋斗
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    （一）
    毛主席在这次会议的开会词中说：“在工业和农业战线上正在发展着的爱国增产运动，是我们国家值得庆贺的新气象。”全国农业生产在中央人民政府成立后的两年中，已有了显著的恢复和部分的发展，扭转了由于日寇蒋匪摧残破坏所造成的农业生产下降的趋势。经过这两年的努力恢复，一般地区生产水平已接近抗战前生产水平，大部老解放区已达到战前水平，部分老解放区已超过战前水平。如山西省农业生产总值，已超过战前水平百分之十六点二；山东省粮食总产量已超过战前水平百分之九；东北区农产量已超过其历史最高水平（一九四三年）百分之七点六。现在全国粮食总产量，已恢复到战前最高年产量的百分之九十二点八；棉花总产量，已超过战前最高年产量的百分之十七点八，基本上改变了反动统治时代国内粮棉供应须依靠进口的半殖民地状态。更由于农业生产的恢复与发展，人民生活水平也有了显著的提高，如东北人民的购买力，一九五一年比一九四九年提高了两倍半；即以棉布为例：一九四九年平均每十人买一匹，一九五一年平均每三人买一匹。老解放区完成土地改革后，经过两三年的生产，已有百分之七、八十的农民，过着中农生活，各地农村修盖房屋、添置农具牲畜和肥料的现象，已很普遍。这充分地说明了目前农村经济情况，开始走向了富裕和繁荣。（二）
    全国农业生产所以能在短短的两年之内，获得这样迅速地恢复的原因，首先是由于毛主席、中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，人民解放军的英勇善战，使解放战争在全国地区获得了胜利，又经过剿匪反霸，安定了社会秩序，农民有了全力进行生产的环境。
    其次是由于全国已有三万万多人口的地区完成了土地改革，解放了农业生产力。其他地区也进行了减租退押运动，农民生产积极性空前提高。中央人民政府又及时地颁布了一系列保护与奖励生产的政策，如“谁种谁收”，“自由借贷”，“合理负担”，“棉粮比价”等，更稳定与提高了农民生产的情绪，保证了农业生产计划的完成。
    抗美援朝与镇压反革命运动，巩固了土地改革，激发了农民群众爱国生产、支援前线的热情。很多地区的农民在抗美援朝保家卫国的号召下，提高了对祖国的热爱，加深了对帝国主义的仇恨，他们纷纷订出爱国增产捐献计划，用努力增产捐献的实际行动，充实抗美援朝运动的内容，使今年的农业生产运动呈现了新的面貌。（三）
    特别值得提出的：两年来，全国农业生产显著的恢复，是在与自然灾害作艰苦的斗争中获得的。由于日寇蒋匪的长期破坏，造成了一九四九年的严重水灾，但经过各地的大力修治，基本上保证了一九五○年的农田收益，尤其是今年治淮工程的初步成功，一般地战胜了洪水对农业的严重威胁。一九五○年全国各地曾在一亿余亩耕地上进行了治虫工作，减少了农产损失约计十六亿斤，一九五一年虫害面积和严重程度都超过去年，仅蝗虫、蚜虫、螟虫为害面积即达一亿二千余万亩。但经各级政府大力领导群众，用了八万万个工作日，防治捕打，均已基本消灭。在蝗虫发生严重地区，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会特别派遣空军，协助扑灭，这是我国历史上的创举，国民党反动派统治时期绝对作不到的。一九五一年全国有十五个省区约九千余万亩农田受旱，成灾约三千五百万亩。经过动员和组织广大农民进行抗旱斗争后，在华北，大部棉田播种，以抢墒挑水，艰苦完成；在南方，很多山区推行了组织水车、接续扬水、越山灌溉的方法，减少了旱灾面积。由于全国各地积极修渠打井开塘垒堰，掀起群众性的抗旱运动，增加灌溉面积八百五十余万亩。一九五一年农业生产受到各种自然灾害的严重威胁，如在反动统治时代势必酿成极大灾荒，但由于人民政府和中国共产党各级党委，领导群众进行坚决不懈的艰苦斗争，终于确保了粮棉等主要作物的产量，仍能超过去年，因而增强了今后我们战胜自然灾害的决心和信心。（四）
    两年来，全国农业生产的显著恢复，是在普遍开展爱国生产运动中，贯彻了组织起来发展生产的方针得来的。各地参加互助组的户数：华北区占总户数百分之六十，东北区达百分之七十；完成土地改革的新区，互助组织也有很大发展。老解放区互助组的内容，由过去简单的劳畜力互助，逐渐发展到经济上和生产上的合作，出现了农业生产合作社或土地合作社，这是群众极大的创造。互助合作组织的优越性，首先表现在产量大大提高，显著地优越于单干，如山西李顺达、吉林韩恩、山东吕鸿宾等互助组，产量均超过战前一倍。事实证明，共同纲领所规定的“在一切已彻底实现土地改革的地区，人民政府应组织农民及一切可以从事农业的劳动力以发展农业生产及其副业为中心任务，并应引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利的原则，组织各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作”的方针是完全正确的。组织起来是改进技术、提高效率、发展农业生产的正确方向，今后更应贯彻大量发展和稳步提高的方针，使爱国增产运动，得到更大的发展。（五）
    在今年的爱国丰产运动中，出现了单位面积产量显著提高的典型，如列席这次会议的山西劳动模范李顺达今年每亩产玉米九百八十斤；山西劳动模范曲耀离，创造了每亩产棉九百二十斤的新纪录，超过战前全国每亩平均产量十二倍以上；河北省劳动模范张希舜今年谷子产量每亩达到一千三百斤，超过战前华北每亩平均产量八倍以上；平原劳动模范王希河今年每亩小麦产九百斤，超过战前九倍；东北区吉林省敦化县周凤吉每亩水稻产一千四百斤；苏南江阴县劳动模范唐玉民每亩水稻产一千二百斤；西南区云南省劳动模范谭朝梁每亩水稻产九百九十二斤；天津小站区有一百二十六户农民每亩水稻产量超过一千斤，其中邹玉彬每亩水稻产一千四百多斤。这些丰产典型正在各地陆续出现，已不仅是部分地区的个别农户了，它已经给广大农民做出榜样，树立旗帜，有力地说明了单位面积产量可以大大提高，我们伟大祖国的农业增产有着远大的前途。两年来生产运动中出现的丰产范例，更加鼓舞和增强了全国广大农民的爱国增产的信心。因此，一九五二年的农业生产，要求提高单位面积产量的方针是完全正确的。为了加强抗美援朝和国家建设的力量，迅速恢复与超过战前生产水平，正如毛主席所指示的“只要我们善于团结、教育和依靠工人和农民，我国就一定会要出现一个普遍高涨的爱国增产运动”。我们愿竭尽一切力量，为开展更大规模的爱国增产运动而奋斗。
    妇女工作者代表章蕴发言
    团结教育广大妇女成为建设祖国的力量主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    毛主席的开会词、周总理的政治报告，以及其他各位负责同志的会务报告，关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告，经济工作和财政工作的报告，文化教育工作的报告，我们妇女工作者都完全赞成并竭诚拥护。
    我们妇女工作者和各界代表一样，具有决心和勇气执行毛主席的指示：“继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。”我们将尽一切努力，进一步发动和组织妇女，和各界人民团结一致来完成这个重大的任务。
    在革命已经胜利、人民作了主人、妇女权利获得了法律保障的新中国，在美帝国主义还在拖延谈判继续侵朝战争、抗美援朝的伟大斗争还须继续进行的时候，我们妇女工作者首要的责任是：团结广大的妇女，提高她们的政治觉悟，培养她们从事建设工作的本领，使她们成为建设祖国和抗美援朝的巨大力量。为了达到这个目的，我们另一重大的责任就是力求贯彻实现共同纲领第六条的规定：“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。实行男女婚姻自由”。
    两年来，由于共产党、毛主席和人民政府的正确领导，各民主党派各人民团体的支持协助和配合，使数千年来荼害妇女的旧的封建婚姻制度正在迅速崩溃，新的新民主主义婚姻制度正在建立起来。妇女在家庭和社会的地位有了显著的提高。在生产战线上，开始实行男女同工同酬。妇女参加各种社会活动的范围更加宽广了。妇女参政的人数也逐渐多起来了，各级人民政府和人民代表会议都有妇女参加，有些市、县以上人民代表会议的妇女人数达到了百分之十左右。各级人民政府委员会都选有女委员。正因为如此，祖国的各项号召，都得到妇女热烈地响应；在抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动中，妇女表现了高度的积极性，起了相当大的作用。在抗美援朝运动中，大批妇女自觉自愿地送夫送子参军，自己努力学习工业或农业技术，从事生产，克服困难。许多妇女进行增产节约，捐献飞机大炮。单以上海一个城市的家庭妇女来说，她们就认捐了七架飞机，（已经缴款九十亿元），全国各地妇女除各按系统与各界一起积极捐献之外，单以妇女号命名的飞机将近六十架。在土地改革运动中，妇女和男人一样表现出积极、勇敢和有力量，尤其在控诉地主的罪行时，她们深刻动人地控诉，起了很大的鼓励、教育作用。在镇压反革命运动中，妇女们更是表现了无限忠诚，出现了许多巧计捉特务和大义灭亲的事例。
    以上事实说明了什么呢？它一方面说明：只有共产党、毛主席领导的人民中国，国家才关心妇女的利益，妇女们也才能起来为祖国服务，保卫祖国；另一方面又说明了妇女们和男人们同样具有才能智慧，只要组织起来，就是一支强大的力量。
    但是新中国成立才有两年，中国几千年来重男轻女、男尊女卑的封建思想还来不及也不可能很快地肃清。在妇女前进的道路上，还有种种障碍，使妇女力量不能充分发挥。不少的人对共同纲领第六条重视不够。特别是婚姻法已经公布一年多，但至今还有很大一部分妇女，没有从封建的婚姻制度和封建思想的束缚下解放出来，不少的妇女还在被奴役受虐待。妇女为了争取婚姻自由而招致被杀和自杀的现象不断发生。而这种现象发生以后，有的人熟视无睹，有人认为死几个妇女不要紧；甚至有些政府工作人员地方工作干部，对这种野蛮的行为采取袖手旁观的态度。有的还有意予以宽纵、袒护；甚至有些干部还直接干涉妇女婚姻自由，包办妇女群众的婚姻。所以有许多妇女群众反映说：“推翻了父母包办婚姻，又来了干部包办婚姻。”这说明这些干部本身就存在严重的封建思想，就不重视共同纲领第六条的规定，就没有很好地体会人民政府的法令——婚姻法。这说明封建残余思想还相当的嚣张。为了加速祖国的建设和扩大抗美援朝的力量，执行共同纲领第六条的规定，贯彻婚姻法，在全国范围内展开一个反封建思想的斗争，加强男女平等观念，在目前是迫切需要的。中央人民政府政务院适时地发布了关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示，并派出检查小组到各地检查，有效地支援妇女的反封建斗争，我们满意和拥护这种措施。我们妇女工作者过去努力不够，今后应首先加强这一工作，并力求见效。同时急切要求各级人民政府、协商委员会、各民主党派、各人民团体给以更有力的支持，并通过各种工作予以配合。
    在这里，我们提出一九五二年妇女工作主要的要求。妇女工作应围绕当前的中心任务，作出新的成就，这个成就必须从四个方面表现出来：
    第一、妇女参加政权、参加生产、参加学习以及参加各种工作的数量和质量，应有显著的增加和提高。在继续抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，要表现得比过去更有力量，更能起一个支柱的作用。
    第二、要继续大张旗鼓宣传和贯彻婚姻法，以使婚姻法家喻户晓，老少皆知。已经土地改革的地区，要求切实废除包办买卖婚姻，实行婚姻自主。
    第三、尽可能培养大批妇女，变成生产后备力量，迎接祖国的大生产建设，力争有计划地使家庭劳动妇女逐渐走上社会劳动。
    第四、号召各级民主妇女联合会干部学习毛泽东选集，用毛泽东思想武装自己，改造思想，改进工作。以上各项，首先妇女工作者必须付以极大的努力，但由于妇女中有各界，各界中有妇女，从而决定了妇女工作渗透在各种工作和人民团体之中，因此，还需各级人民政府、协商委员会、各民主党派、各人民团体的领导和支持。特别是在发动组织和教育群众时，要求采纳全国民主妇女联合会所提出的男女一齐发动的方针，同时教育和提高其中的妇女群众，照顾和解决群众中的妇女问题。这将更有利于人民民主建设事业。
    只有这样妇女才能全面发动起来，妇女问题才能彻底解决，广大妇女的力量才能更好地发挥出来，用在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大事业中。
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    农业劳动模范李顺达发言
    农民要实现增产节约抗美援朝三大任务各位首长、各位代表同志们：
    我代表农业劳动模范发表些意见。在这次会议上，我们听了毛主席、周总理和各位首长的报告，我们完全同意完全拥护；听了各界代表们的讲话，我们也很同意。我们国家在敬爱的领袖毛主席领导下，两年来各方面的工作得到了这样大的成绩，特别是抗美援朝得到了伟大的胜利，我们感到非常兴奋，真是有说不出的那么高兴。毛主席、周总理的报告已经指示给我们今后要做三件大事——继续加强抗美援朝，增加生产，厉行节约。请毛主席、周总理和各位首长放心，回去后我们一定做好这三件任务。我们怎样做呢？
    第一件先说抗美援朝：我们中国人民从来是爱好和平的，我们不去侵略旁人，但是，我们也决不能忍受旁人的侵略。谁要想侵略我们，我们就要打倒他。美帝国主义想横行霸道抢占别国的土地，欺侮世界的人民，他抢占了我们中国的台湾，又想灭亡我们的邻国朝鲜，再从朝鲜打进中国来。我们都知道全国人民是实在忍耐不住了，才组织志愿军到朝鲜去。志愿军到朝鲜的一年中与朝鲜人民军在一起，打了许多胜仗，共消灭敌军三十八万多。这就证明了毛主席所说的美国是纸老虎。毛主席已断定了美帝国主义一定失败，我们完全信服毛主席说的话，听毛主席的话。我们国庆观礼时，又看到许多新式武器：喷气式飞机、火箭炮、坦克车，还有叫不上名的新式武器，胜利信心更坚定了。可是，我们也知道美帝国主义并不死心，他在谈判中没有一点儿诚意，和过去国民党与我们谈判时一样。所以我们一定要提高警惕，随时准备好，如果他要再敢进攻，就要给他更大的打击。回去后，我们要好好宣传首长们关于抗美援朝的报告，动员农民订爱国公约，增产节约，优待烈军家属，捐献飞机大炮，坚决支援志愿军。
    第二件增加生产。我们农民的重要任务是多打粮食，多生产工业原料，多喂养牲畜。我们明年一定要更好地组织互助组，提高生产技术，增加产量。我那地方是山地，增产条件困难，可是我有信心克服一切困难，精耕细作多施肥料，保证每亩再增产粮食二十斤，并向全国农民兄弟们提议，把丰产运动开展起来。我们大家一致认为应该向工人老大哥学习，多想办法，改良技术，不能满足过去生产的老一套。张希舜同志，今年一亩谷子打一千三百斤，他说：明年还要再进一步提高产量。曲耀离同志，今年每亩棉花产籽棉九百多斤，他说：保证明年每亩要超过一千斤。各位农业劳动模范都要作到丰产。我们不只是自己增加生产还要推动群众增加生产，帮助烈属军属增加生产。生产多了才能改善自己的生活，和保证国家的需要。
    第三件说说节约。节约不只是国家机关、工厂、学校和城市里很需要，就是在农村里也需要。毛主席现在提出节约的号召真是正当时候，因为这两年以来，我们争取到丰收，生活已经改善，农村里也发生了一些浪费的事情，如请客、送礼，和红白喜事时大请班乐会等等，如果开展起节约运动，那不知要节省多少钱，用到生产上可以争取更大的丰收。我们怎样开展节约运动呢？
    1、领导群众订家庭生活计划，常言说：“吃不穷，穿不穷，打算不到一世穷”，一切要有计划，不花不应该花的钱，不做不应该做的事。不糟踏一颗粮食。收获的时候，不丢掉一粒粮食，如东北邓国璋同志他们那地方打场时，打干净点，每家就可多收五、六斗粮食。保存的时候不让老鼠倒，虫子蚀，不损失粮食，特别要动员妇女们打倒“锅台税”。
    （锅台税就是家里的粮食多了，妇女们做饭时手把大了，多下米，多合面，结果吃不完浪费了，所以我们就叫他锅台税。）
    2、红白喜事要少花钱。
    3、请客送礼要减少。
    我们回去后，一定深入宣传毛主席和各位首长的指示，结合读报组和座谈会把发给我们的文件，做到一读，二讲，三讨论，使大家都知道我们国家两年的成绩，一年抗美援朝的胜利，并接受毛主席指示我们的三大任务，拿我们的工作成绩回答毛主席和各位首长。
    敬爱的毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    工业劳动模范郭树德发言
    发扬爱国主义精神努力生产厉行节约主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    听了中央人民政府各位首长的报告，使我们感到十分兴奋和愉快。对于这些报告，我们表示坚决地拥护，并为这些报告中所提出的任务的彻底实现而奋斗。
    新中国才诞生两年，中国人民在这短短两年当中，在政治、经济、军事、文化的改革和建设工作方面都获得了巨大的成就。现在除台湾以外，我们已解放了全部国土，肃清了一百万国民党的残余土匪武装，建立了巩固的人民民主政权。我们轰轰烈烈地进行了并正在进行着抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革的三大运动，并已获得了辉煌的胜利。在国外，我国与苏联等十九个国家建立了外交关系，并与苏联结成了牢不可破的友好同盟。由于这一切，我们人民的祖国——中华人民共和国已经日益巩固和强大起来了。
    中国人民之所以能够获得这样辉煌的伟大成就，是由于中国人民的英明领袖毛泽东主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府正确领导的结果，我们工人阶级谨向中央人民政府致敬！向中国共产党致敬！向伟大的英明的领袖——毛主席致敬！
    我们知道，美帝国主义和蒋匪残余决不甘心于失败，要继续破坏我们的和平建设。美帝国主义去年疯狂地发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，公然侵占了我国的领土台湾，非法签订单独对日和约，积极重新武装日本，一再破坏开城中立区的协议，蓄意阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的进行。这些事实充分证明美帝国主义是中国人民与世界人民的公敌，已激起中国各阶层人民和全世界爱好和平人民的无比的愤怒。
    中国工人阶级和全国人民在中国共产党领导下，经过三十年的艰苦斗争所赢得的胜利果实，是决不容许任何帝国主义者来侵犯的。我们英勇的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜英勇作战，毅然出国与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，抵御美帝国主义的侵略军，就是为了保卫祖国保卫和平的目的。一年来人民志愿军的英勇战斗，已经建立了莫大的功勋，严重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略凶焰，粉碎了它在远东和世界上的侵略阴谋，给全世界被帝国主义压迫的民族和爱好和平人民以极大的鼓舞。在这个时期中，中国工人阶级和全国人民一道，进行了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，普遍订立了爱国公约，开展了爱国主义劳动竞赛，积极完成了增产捐献计划，有力地支援了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的正义战争。我们今后还要更紧密地在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，更进一步地发扬爱国主义的精神，努力生产，厉行节约，为保卫我们伟大的祖国，粉碎帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋，为胜利结束朝鲜战争，保卫远东和世界和平而奋斗到底。
    让那些战争贩子们在我们面前发抖吧！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉（维吾尔族）发言
    新疆各族人民得到了无限光明的前途主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    听了毛主席的开会词，周总理的政治报告和各首长的报告，我感到无限的兴奋和愉快。我谨代表西北各少数民族向我们胜利的鼓舞者和领导者、我们的伟大领袖毛主席致以崇高的敬礼，并向全国人民祝贺我们祖国在政治、经济、文化等各方面和在抗美援朝战线上所获得的伟大胜利！
    我们完全拥护毛主席的指示、周总理和各首长的报告，我们保证为彻底完成他们的指示而坚决奋斗。
    新疆人民在解放以后两年来，依靠中国共产党的领导和人民解放军的援助，彻底剿灭了为蒋介石匪帮和美英帝国主义所长期豢养的反革命武装，改造了起义军队，巩固了地方治安，实现了人民代表会议制度，建立了人民政权。在各民族之间，已经建立起空前的平等、友爱和互助的兄弟般的关系，由历来反动统治所造成的互相仇视和隔阂的落后状况已经一去不复返了。
    新疆人民的生活现在已经获得了初步的改善。耕地面积比较一九四九年增加了百分之二十四点零四，产量增加了百分之三十四点一；棉田增加了百分之九点五六，皮棉产量增加了百分之二十八点七八。国营贸易公司的等价交换政策促进了对内对外贸易的发展，使人民的大宗土产如皮毛、棉花、葡萄干等得以畅销各地，换回了人民所需要的布匹、茶叶等日用必需品和农业生产工具。
    政治的改革和生活的改善，加强了各民族人民的政治积极性和生产积极性。
    在解放以前，边疆各民族人民长期地在反动政权的民族压迫政策的统治下，不但不了解我们祖国是这样伟大，这样美丽和可爱，而且对于汉民族有相当的隔阂。但是在人民解放军解放了新疆以后，各民族人民在思想上有了一个很大的转变。他们懂得了：过去压迫他们的人并不是汉民族人民，而只是汉民族的反动统治阶级。他们懂得了：汉民族人民实在是边疆各民族人民的伟大的朋友。伟大的、先进的、革命的汉民族人民，是中国革命的唯一的中坚。只有依靠汉民族人民的援助，只有在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导之下，只有在西北军政委员会和中共中央新疆分局的正确领导和人民解放军的兄弟般的援助之下，新疆各民族人民才能得到今天的真正自由、平等、幸福的生活，才能保证各民族的无限光明前途。
    新疆各民族人民对于祖国的热爱不断地高涨着。
    在这里，我要指出，去年毛主席和中央人民政府所派的少数民族访问团在新疆的访问，以及新疆各民族代表在北京和其他各地的访问，在增进各民族友谊方面有伟大的意义。曾经在反动统治时期备受侮辱和轻视的少数民族的劳动群众，特别是年老的人们，当他们看见访问团到来的时候，非常感动地说：“毛主席派访问团来慰问我们了。到底也有人来慰问我们啊！”说得流下泪来。“毛主席万岁！”
    “中国共产党万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”的欢呼声，响彻了全新疆的每一个角落。新疆各民族代表在北京和其他各地的访问更使他们具体地认识了祖国的伟大和可爱，充实了对祖国的知识。新疆虽然远在西北的边陲，但是新疆各民族人民的意念向着毛主席和毛主席所在地的首都北京。新疆各民族人民都因为在毛主席领导下，摆脱了帝国主义的压迫和半殖民地的枷锁，成为独立、统一、繁荣的中华人民共和国大家庭中的有平等权利的一员而感觉骄傲和光荣。
    新疆人民的这种爱国热情，在抗美援朝运动中表现得十分突出。全新疆各民族人民和各机关团体的工作人员热烈地响应抗美援朝总会的号召，普遍地展开了订立爱国公约和捐献飞机大炮的运动。新疆人民原来认捐的飞机三十架，大炮七门的数字，看来大有超过的可能。因为仅仅伊犁、塔城、阿山等三个专区捐献的数字就已经有人民币八十亿元，绵羊五万只，马两千匹，牛两千头，骆驼八十只，食粮四十多万斤。而人民的热情的捐献仍在继续着。
    新疆人民保证将在今后更加努力地和切实地执行毛主席和中央人民政府的一切命令，完成建设新中国的一切任务，坚决镇压反革命分子的任何破坏活动，为保卫我们伟大的祖国——各民族人民的大家庭的安全，为巩固中苏两大国的友谊和以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，为保卫远东和全世界的和平而奋斗到底。
    中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军万岁！
    全国各民族人民的友爱合作万岁！
    中苏两大国友好合作万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    老根据地代表崔玉振发言
    坚决执行毛主席的号召争取更大光荣主席、各位委员、各位首长：
    我们老根据地的代表，一致拥护毛主席的开会词、周总理和其他首长的报告，我们决心把这些贵重的指示带回老根据地，传达给所有人民，并使他们明白当前的斗争目标，团结一致，为坚决地完成抗美援朝，生产节约的光荣任务而斗争。
    我们老根据地人民，过去认清跟着毛主席走就会翻身。因此不怕万恶的帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的镇压、屠杀、进攻、破坏，在毛主席和共产党领导下，刻苦耐劳、英勇奋斗，不怕流血牺牲，出人、出钱，经过二十多年的斗争，终在全国人民的共同努力下，在毛主席的英明领导下，使中国人民真正地翻了身，这是老根据地人民的光荣，也是全国人民的光荣。但我们绝不能因此而自满，我们决心响应毛主席的号召，为继续发扬革命传统，争取更大的光荣而奋斗。
    我们全国人民在毛主席正确领导下，一齐动手，打倒了反动统治，建立了人民自己的政权，人民当了国家的主人，再也不会受那些王八蛋帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和土豪劣绅的欺负了。同时又分配了土地，消灭了封建剥削，镇压了反革命，肃清了土匪，挖断了坏种的老根。现在天是人民的天，地是人民的地，使那些祸地草永远不能在人民的土地上生长起来了。使那些蝗虫永远不能在人民的天空下飞起来了。解放后毛主席和人民政府领导我们还进行了恢复与发展生产、文教许多大事，使我们人民安居乐业，生活一天比一天过的美起来了。可是万恶的美帝国主义，不愿意我新中国人民过着自由幸福的日子，它要破坏我们自由幸福的生活，它妄想还要把我们中国人民变成像过去一样，做它的牛马奴隶，因此它于去年夏天发动了侵朝战争，同时又侵占我国领土——台湾，轰炸我国东北，它想走日本鬼子的老路——灭亡朝鲜，侵略中国，但我们要告诉美国鬼子，中国人民已经站起来了，世界好多国家的人民也都站起来了，站起来的人民，要保卫胜利果实，不允许你们这伙王八蛋再来欺负了。我们老根据地的人民誓言坚决地响应毛主席的一切号召，实行工农联盟，努力发展生产，厉行节约，时刻准备着国家要人就出人，要钱就出钱。同时我们还要认真的做好优待抚恤工作，使烈、军属有衣有食，前线战士奋勇杀敌，一定要打败美帝国主义，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利。同时还要和世界人民一道，为保卫和平、保卫民主而斗争。
    此外，说到我们老根据地人民曾因长期遭受敌人的摧残与战争的破坏，许多地区房屋、牲畜、农具等，被敌人烧毁、抢掠光，各种经济与文化事业，遭受严重摧残，造成我老根据地人民严重的灾难。在解放后，虽有很大恢复，但部分被严重破坏的地区，人民生活仍然贫困。老区人民要求政府帮助他们，发展生产，提高文化，重建家园，恢复战争创伤，但我们知道今天我们首要任务是抗美援朝，建设国防，因此，我们不应该一切依赖政府解决，我们决心执行毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示，组织起来，团结起来，订好爱国增产公约，努力完成抗美援朝，巩固国防，增产节约的光荣任务。
    最后，毛主席和中央人民政府，对我们老根据地人民十分关怀，不仅领导我们从政治上、经济上翻了身，并且在物质与精神方面，给我们很多的帮助与鼓励。毛主席和中央人民政府今年又派访问团，访问老根据地，并帮助我们解决了许多问题，还要请老根据地人民代表进京参加国庆观礼和出席毛主席的宴会，我们老根据地的观礼代表又推出自己的代表列席中国人民政协全国委员会的会议，使我们学习了许多宝贵知识，这些好处，老区人民永远忘不了的。因此我们老根据地人民，万分感谢毛主席和中央人民政府的关怀，感谢英勇善战的人民解放军和人民志愿军。
    祝毛主席、朱总司令和政府各位首长身体健康！
    钢铁工程师王之玺发言
    把科学技术与群众结合为国家积累财富主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    听了毛主席的开会词、周总理的政治报告、彭真副主席抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告、陈云主任的财经报告和郭沫若主任的文教报告，我完全同意，并且竭诚拥护。
    过去一年来我们英勇的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上击退了美帝国主义及其帮凶们的侵略军取得了伟大的胜利，国内政治经济教育文化工作获得了辉煌的成就，这一切使我们感到兴奋与鼓舞。我谨代表科学技术工作者向中国人民志愿军致敬，向伟大人民领袖毛主席致敬。
    毛主席指示我们抗美援朝增产节约，是我们今天的中心任务，我是一位工业部门的技术工作者，我们技术工作者们在抗美援朝增产节约运动中应该做些什么？无疑的我们的主要任务是增产节约，增产节约中为国家积累的财富，可以购买飞机大炮，就是以实际行动来支援了抗美援朝运动。
    今年抗美援朝的运动中，我们工业部门的工作同志们已经有了一些供献。运动展开以后，工人阶级和技术人员在爱国主义的感召下，迅速普遍卷入了爱国主义运动的高潮，很多工厂在运动中实行了民主改革，发动了劳动竞赛，争取改进了管理制度，获得了超计划生产。东北地区在高岗主席的领导下更号召了国营、公营工厂一九五一年下半年在完成原定计划的基础上为国家增产节约总值合五百万吨粮。这个号召得到了东北各地职工的热烈响应，经过群众的具体讨论与布置，不仅勇敢地接受了这一巨大任务，并且要加倍完成，就是增产节约一千万吨粮。同志们，一千万吨粮不是一个小数，它等于全国粮食增产了百分之八，相当于人民币六万三千亿，可以购买喷气式飞机四千余架。但是，这仅是东北一区国、公营企业在半年中增产节约的成就，也只是增加产量节约资金降低成本三方面努力的结果。这证明了在毛泽东旗帜下工人阶级做了工厂的主人翁，工人和技术人员政治觉悟提高了，生产积极性发挥了以后，工业潜在力量的伟大，也就是毛主席所说的“我国人民能够发挥其无穷无尽的力量。这种力量是任何敌人所不能战胜的。”
    同志们，毛主席号召我们增产节约，陈主任给了我们一个任务，就是将增产节约运动扩展到全国，增产节约的工作，从更多的方面来进行，要完成今年增产节约收入的一倍两倍甚至三倍。这个任务大不大呢？很大，能不能完成呢？我肯定地答复，在毛主席的领导下，广大群众运动下，我们一定能完成，并且可能超额地完成。为完成这项巨大的任务，我们必须与工人群众紧密地团结在一起，作一系列的重要工作。在生产部门，我们至少应该作以下几项工作：（一）要细心研究如何提高设备的利用率，也就是研究各项生产设备如何充分开动起来，相对地延长开动的时间，并且如何充分发挥设备的效率；（二）加强生产计划及生产组织工作，使我们每一个生产过程紧密衔接起另一个生产过程，加速生产；（三）研究改进生产方法和推广先进生产经验，这一项我们过去已经有了些成就；（四）研究如何改进现有设备并补充关键设备以增加生产。生产中常常因为设备的不平衡或缺乏某一样关键设备，严重地影响产量。我举个突出的例子来讲，如东北的水泥工业中缺乏大型减速齿轮，限制了产量，如果能设法解决了这个问题，补充上十几套减速齿轮，水泥的产量就可提高产量三十万吨，等于建设了三座新厂；（五）加速流动资金的周转。今年东北在这方面有些收获，我们主要从减少材料储备，加速成品推销，缩短生产过程这三方面努力，以求缩短流动资金的周转期，为国家节约资金；（六）减低消耗定额，每个单位产品原材料、水、电、人工的消耗尽量降低，直接地减低了成本；（七）改进劳动组织提高劳动生产率增高产量；（八）改进质量。在严格执行操作规程和检查制度之下，提高质量，减少废品，也就是提高了产量；（九）合理地使用材料减少浪费。我们在计划与设计工作方面应该对计划与设计工作采取高度的负责精神，根据国家当前情况及将来发展，细心研究、多方考虑，不仅不要犯技术上的错误，也不要犯粗心大意设计或计划基础上或原则上的错误。一个计划如果基础上犯了错误，可以酿成不可挽救的损失，一个设计图上的一点一线可以造成建设工程上的巨额浪费。我们在基本建设工作方面要对于材料供应、材料质量、劳动组织、施工检查各方面的工作，予以严密的注意。工程的质量、建设的效果，要决定于施工。基本建设工作做好，就可使国家投资发生它应有的效果，否则就变成巨大的浪费。我们在科学研究工作方面，要围绕着增产节约为中心，结合实际需要来布置我们的研究工作重点，这样我们的工作才能与工业生产相结合，才能发生实际的效果。
    同志们，只有我们生在毛泽东时代的技术工作者们才有机会把自己的技术毫无保留地贡献给祖国。让我们团结起来为完成当前这一巨大任务而奋斗。
    我们要做好以上各种繁复的技术工作，我们必须与群众结合，我们必须响应周总理的号召，学习马列主义在中国具体化的毛泽东思想。我们科学技术界的知识分子，多数是从旧社会中成长起来的，每个人在思想意识上，都或多或少的存在着封建主义资本主义旧民主主义思想残余。我们必须认真地、有系统地学习毛泽东思想，运用批评自我批评的武器，进行彻底的思想改造，才能使技术与政治结合，技术与群众结合，技术更好地为人民服务。有人讲我们学技术的人们，专门钻研技术，不必过问政治，这样对于工作可能供献更多。这种说法是错误的。技术人员必须提高自己的政治水平，才能使自己的技术更好地为人民服务。
    同志们，认清了这一点我们就必须决心地认真地去学习毛泽东思想。惟有用马列主义在中国具体化的毛泽东思想武装起来的技术工作者，才能彻底地改造了自己，提高了自己，才能使自己的技术与群众相结合，担当起毛主席号召增产节约的巨大任务。
    毛主席在开会词里指出，思想改造，首先是知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实行民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。让我们在毛主席的领导下做好这一件中国工业化的准备工作。
    最后我高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    人民政协全国委员会委员朱德海（朝鲜族）发言
    东北朝鲜族人民热烈展开爱国增产竞赛主席、委员、各位同志们：
    在这次会议上，听到了毛主席的开会词和周总理的政治报告后，感觉到这不但是总结了一年来以毛主席为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，我们伟大的祖国所获得的辉煌的成就，同时又很明确地向全国各族人民指出了为争取新的更伟大的胜利而今后努力奋斗的方向。我代表东北朝鲜族人民表示完全同意，并为其实现而努力。
    我们中华人民共和国成立后两年来，在政治、国防、经济、文化教育建设上都取得了伟大的胜利，人民民主专政巩固了，整个中国大陆全部得到了解放。在一年来的抗美援朝运动中，英勇的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜境内与英勇的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，粉碎了美帝国主义的狂妄的侵略，取得了伟大的胜利，这不仅保卫了我们伟大的祖国的安全，而且保卫了远东和世界的和平。这些伟大胜利的事实，有力地证明了一件事，那就是毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府的一切政策方针与各种措施是完全正确的、英明的。我们各族人民永远团结在毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府周围，在毛主席的领导下，遵守毛主席的指示行动的时候，胜利是永远属于我们的，光荣永远属于中国各族人民，幸福是无穷的。
    我们东北朝鲜族人民在这两年来，在各级人民政府正确地贯彻民族平等政策的结果，在各方面也同样地取得了很大的成绩。由于大力地展开了生产运动，生产迅速地恢复与发展起来，朝鲜族人民的生活也继续改善与提高了。以东北朝鲜族人民多数聚居的延边地区来说，农民的百分之六四点五已达到了中农的生活程度。跟着经济生活的上升，文化教育普遍地有了发展，全区有一个大学、两个语文专修学校、一个两级师范、一个高中（现正在再建一个高中）、二四个初中、四○三个小学，平均一个行政村就有一个小学校，两个区就有一个中学校，按人口比例平均一○七六人中就有一名大学生，三五人中就有一名中学生，五点五人中就有一名小学生，学龄儿童有百分之九十三入学，参加农民学校学习的农民群众有八万多，并已有了民族的报纸、出版机关、广播电台、文工团等，部分农村中已建立了农村俱乐部、小型图书馆、群众业余剧团等，群众的文化生活一天天丰富，文化水平也一天天提高。
    自从美帝国主义武装侵略朝鲜，侵占我国领土台湾，逼近我国的边疆，不断轰炸和扫射东北边境的城市和乡村，在这样的情况下，东北朝鲜族人民也和各族人民一同普遍地激起了抗美援朝的要求，掀起了抗美援朝参军参战的热潮，并把抗美援朝的号召贯彻到爱国丰产战线上，展开了广泛的群众性的爱国主义生产竞赛，并普遍地受到了抗美援朝爱国主义教育，普遍地订立了爱国公约，并展开了捐献运动与作好优抚工作的运动。以延边地区来说，七十余万人口中，有五十余万人受到了抗美援朝爱国主义教育，百分之五十的人口订立了爱国公约，增产捐献达到六十七亿元，爱国增产竞赛中大大地推动了妇女劳动力卷入生产战线上来，如延吉县兴安村妇女劳动力增加了百分之四十三点三。优抚工作普遍进行了包耕包粮制，并且经过这样轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，汉朝民族关系更加团结互助友爱了。
    虽然有这样的成绩，但我们是不能以此来满足、更不能忽视目前因为民族干部数量上不够与质量上不高而各种工作上存在的缺点和急待解决的问题，其中特别要注意的是继续克服狭隘的民族主义思想，加强国际主义与爱国主义思想，继续彻底克服订立爱国公约中的形式主义，这就要我们应很好地研究和切实地执行周总理的政治报告中所提到的今后民族工作的方针和抗美援朝总会彭真副主席报告中的抗美援朝工作的方针。
    同时，我热烈响应周总理的推动各方面组织学习毛泽东选集的号召，我认为很好地学习毛泽东选集是克服狭隘的民族主义思想、搞好民族地区工作的唯一的办法。我们少数民族干部真正学会毛泽东思想的时候，可以说中国境内民族问题就取得了最后胜利！
    最后，我确信，在毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府领导下，在现有的各民族人民友谊团结的基础上，更加团结，共同奋斗，坚决执行贯彻这一次会议中所决定的各项工作任务的时候，我们在下一次会议上一定就能见到我们伟大的祖国获得比今天更光辉灿烂的胜利！
    中国各族人民大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    西南军政委员会副主席熊克武发言
    两年来西南各项工作都有了显著成就主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这次列席会议，听了毛主席的开会词和周总理、彭副主席、陈副总理、郭副总理关于政治、抗美援朝、经济财政、文化教育各项工作报告，提示了上次会议后十六个月以来全国人民事业各方面所获得的胜利和成就，及各项工作今后的任务。这全符合于当前国家情况和人民需要，我们热烈拥护，并愿为彻底实现而努力。
    西南军政委员会在中国共产党、毛主席及中央人民政府正确领导下，与全区各级政府及全体人民共同努力下，年余以来，各项工作，都获得了显著的成就。
    在土地改革运动中，西南的特点是土地比较集中，封建势力颇为强大，若不先将清匪、反霸、减租、退押等准备工作做好，土地改革是难于顺利进行的。西南去秋便开始了这一系列的工作，于今春基本上胜利完成了这一系列的斗争任务。这就使农村的秩序安定下来，农民得到了价值相当于七十五亿斤大米的收入，生活改善了，生产资料增加了，政治认识提高了。在这一胜利的基础上，我们于今春有计划、有步骤、有秩序地分期进行土地改革。至目前为止，经过两期工作，全区三千五百万左右农业人口的地区，已胜利地完成了土地改革。从两期土地改革中说明土地改革是一剧烈的阶级斗争，企图和平解决是不可能的。现在三期工作业经开始，预定今冬明春除少数民族地区外，将继续完成三千万以上农业人口地区的土地改革，全区土地改革可望基本结束。
    由于土地改革工作的完成，根本改变了广大农村的面貌：地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制废除了，农民翻了身，作了主，分得了土地，不仅政治觉悟提高，而且在他分得的土地上，精耕细作，努力增产，努力捐献，积极参军，以支持抗美援朝的伟大斗争。
    西南是蒋美匪帮最后盘据的地区，布置了大批特务匪徒，并与原有封建势力密切勾结；故解放后组织叛乱，进行各种暗害活动，时有发生，使西南人民遭受无尽的灾祸。自中央人民政府公布惩治反革命条例以后，城市与乡村都发动百分之八十以上的群众，全面展开镇压反革命运动。匪首、恶霸、特务、反动党团首要分子与反动会道门头子等反革命分子，基本上都受到严厉的镇压和应得的惩处。这就使西南的社会秩序呈现出空前未有的安定情况。但反革命残余势力并没有完全彻底肃清，今后还需要继续深入。
    西南抗美援朝运动的发展是由各中心城市扩大到广大农村以及边远地方，很快普及全区，规模空前巨大。到今年“五一”前后，城市百分之八十以上和农村百分之六十左右的人口，都受到新爱国主义的宣传。全区有二千八百二十八万人参加了“五一”爱国示威游行，四千五百五十七万人签名要求五大国缔结和平公约，四千二百五十五万人投票反对美国武装日本。复经过志愿军归国代表和赴朝慰问代表向各地人民报告，更加广泛深入。
    尤其在抗美援朝总会发出推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮、优待烈属军属的三大号召以后，西南人民的抗美援朝运动更向前发展了。人民在爱国增产的基础上，已认捐献飞机二百零九架、大炮十九门、高射炮十二门。各地缴款均异常踊跃，川北行署区认捐战斗机二十七架，而收到捐款竟远超过认捐数字。在农村、工厂、城市、以及各兄弟民族地区，都普遍推动订立爱国公约，增强了人民的团结和积极性；对于任何事业和运动，都以实际行动，表现高度的热情和效率。西南人民在这运动中正发挥着伟大的力量。
    这三大运动的进展，是互相关联的，同样，其他改革和建设，亦是与三大运动分不开的。在财政经济方面：西南虽号称富庶，但经蒋匪帮长期压榨，疯狂掠夺，人民的生活与生产陷于困境。解放后，财政工作坚决贯彻了中央“整顿收入、节约开支、集中管理、统筹统支”的正确方针，基本上保持了收支平衡，稳定了物价；更适应经济建设的需要，有重点地兴办了些企业与事业。
    关于税收：如农业税便联系土地改革的查田评产，使负担较为公平合理；如城市各税，便以爱国主义号召工商业者，以挑战竞赛、揭发逃漏、集体纳库、按率计征等实际行动，来完成税收。
    关于经济事业：农业生产自解放后逐渐增加，今年大量土地改革，产量更形激增。如工业原料作物、棉花已达战前产量百分之一百五十二，甘蔗达百分之八十二，粮食作物亦达百分之八十七点七，都接近或超过战前水平。
    工业生产：因国营企业及私营企业的改进与调整，都迅速恢复，有些并有很大的发展。如以解放前最高年产量为基数，看本年度上半年各种工业的生产指数，铁、煤、盐、糖等十一项产量，虽还没有恢复战前的水平，但比去年已大增加；至钢、铜、电、水泥等七项产量，则远超过以前的最高水平。获得这样的成绩，不单是由于伴随各项经济事业的进步，并且是因抗美援朝运动，号召爱国主义生产竞赛，工人提出无数的合理化建议，普遍提高了劳动生产率，创造出巨大的财富。这不仅增加了生产，且健全了工业组织，造成有利新中国经济发展的准备条件，逐渐走上有计划性的大规模生产的新轨道。
    关于交通贸易：西南解放后，首先对人民数十年来渴望的成渝铁路全线兴工，立即带动许多工业，尤其是钢铁业的发展；现已铺轨二百七十余公里，开始通车。此外修复全区公路，改进内河航运，对区际及城乡物资交流，起了巨大作用。全区各大城市亦随着繁荣起来，国营贸易机构已有一千零七十四个分布全区各大城市及绝大部分县市；现正陆续增设。私营工商业，各大城市都有显著的增加，即重庆一市，今年一至八月总计新开业户便达一万三千二百三十五户。市场需要不断增大，工农业产品深感供不应求，全区经济充分表露健康发展的情形。
    在教育文化方面：高等教育进行了若干改革，以求做到学与用一致，理论与实际一致，以配合国家建设的需要。中小学教育已加整理，就学人数均有增加，小学生激增至五百万人。工农补习教育的学习人数亦大量增加。至于新闻、出版、戏曲、广播等文化事业，均有显著进步；卫生工作事业上，特别组成医疗队和医疗巡回队，到老根据地和少数民族区域去，治疗及注重防疫亦有相当效果。教育文化事业为当前迫切的需要，现正准备条件，促进这些事业的建设。
    在民族工作方面：由于在毛主席的感召下，并由于正确执行了民族政策，各民族间的歧视和隔阂消除了，各民族空前团结起来了。西藏在中央人民政府毛主席亲自指导下，入藏部队的努力与藏族人民的支援下和平解放了，使西藏回到祖国的大家庭来，完成祖国在亚洲大陆上空前未有的统一，给予全国人民及西南各族人民极大的欢欣鼓舞。
    西南各少数民族地区，有许多已建立起自己的政权，建立了专区、县、区、乡的各族自治政府与民族杂居地区的联合政府。他们都在人民政府帮助下，按照自己的意愿，管理本民族的一切事务。为帮助各族人民发展生产、改善生活，一方面建立了对少数民族的贸易机构、实行等价交换、大量收购土特产、供应其生活必需品；另一方面则举办交通、水利、畜牧、垦荒等事业，这些都取得相当的成绩。并创立了三个民族学院及许多干部训练学校，总计已有一万多名各族青年，参加了学习。因而，我们看到少数民族地区的抗美援朝运动同其他地区
    一样的热烈展开着。
    总的说来，各项工作虽有相当成就，但错误和缺点亦同样存在，需要在今后工作中去纠正。这次会议加强抗美援朝、增产节约的号召是极端正确的，我们将因此而预料到我们国家的各项建设一定会迅速的展开。我们感到无限的愉快与兴奋，当努力学习马克思列宁主义与中国革命的实践相结合的毛泽东思想，响应周总理的号召，负起推动各方组织学习毛泽东选集的责任；与各民主阶级、各民主党派、各民族、各界人民，一致用毛泽东思想武装起来。保证彻底完成当前的任务，向着伟大的前途迈进！
    中央人民政府卫生部部长李德全发言
    为进一步提高人民健康水平而奋斗主席、各位委员，各位同志：
    中央人民政府成立两年来，中国人民的卫生状况，有了显著的变化。我们已经基本上改变了旧中国那种疫病流行、广大人民毫无医药照顾的状态，初步提高了人民的健康水平。我们根据共同纲领的卫生政策和全国人民的需要，确定了以“预防为主”“面向工农兵”“团结中西医”为改革和发展卫生事业的总方针，并以首先防治危害人民健康最大的疾病，大量培养各级卫生干部和解决药材的逐步自给为我们的主要任务。这是一个艰巨的工作，因为旧中国的人民卫生状况是太悲惨了，卫生事业基础是太薄弱了，卫生机构和人员的分布是太不合理了。在旧中国，广大劳动人民是毫无健康保障的，尤其广大农村中，根本没有卫生工作。因此，巫医横行杀人敛钱；烈性传染病如鼠疫、天花、霍乱等，年年流行，每年死于这些疾病者，不可胜计；其他传染病如伤寒、痢疾、黑热病、疟疾、结核病、麻疯、性病及寄生虫病如血丝虫病、住血吸虫病、钩虫病等，亦愈延愈广，无人置理。在反动统治时期全国人民的死亡率，估计约在千分之三十以上，而其中半数以上是死于可以预防的传染病。婴儿死亡率在有些地区高达百分之四十以上。有些少数民族地区人口惊人地减少，如伊克昭盟在清初有四十万人口，现在不足十万人，减少百分之七十五。
    针对这种状况，我们两年来根据上述的方针和任务进行了如下的工作：
    第一、加强防疫工作。为了预防历年流行全国的天花，普种牛痘已达二亿人。在北京、旅大、广州等许多城市自去年五月以来未发现过天花病人。我们计划在今后的两年内，全国普种牛痘一次，争取基本上消灭天花。
    为了控制鼠疫的蔓延，我们在东北、察蒙、浙江、福建、云南等鼠疫流行区设立了防治所，发动群众捕鼠灭蚤，并进行预防注射。基本上控制了察蒙等地区的鼠疫，减少了东北等地区的发病率。今年一月至六月全国鼠疫发病人数较去年同时期减少约百分之八十。
    为了制止霍乱及其他传染病的流行，我们恢复和建立了十六个交通检疫所，以防霍乱从国外传入。有重点地进行了饮水消毒和改善环境卫生；两年中进行了霍乱预防注射三千万人，因此三年来我们没有发现一个真性霍乱病人。
    为了机动使用防疫力量，我们在全国组织了一百二十五个防疫队，六千名卫生工作者深入灾区、疫区、治淮工程区，开展群众性的防疫工作，使斑疹伤寒、回归热、伤寒、痢疾未发生大流行。并设立了八个黑热病的防治所，治愈了十一万黑热病人。设立了十八个寄生虫病防治所，进行经常的防治工作。在少数民族地区进行了驱梅、防疟、妇婴保健工作，内蒙的性病防治工作在个别地区已收得成效，生育率已在增加。此外，为了加强疫苗、血清的供应，扩大了七个生物制品所，疫苗、血清的产量超过反动统治时期的十倍以上。
    第二、恢复和发展卫生基层组织。目前全国百分之八十五的县份已经都建立了卫生院，共计一八六五所。卫生院的任务是担负防疫、保健、医疗和训练区、村卫生人员。卫生院的病床已较解放前增加了百分之一百二十二，并用民办公助的方式建立了
    一四九八个区卫生所。工矿区做到平均每八百八十名职工有一个医生，东北工矿区平均每一一五个职工有一个卫生人员。少数民族地区如青海、内蒙、新疆三地已有卫生院九十二所，医院二十四所。我们计划在五、六年内在全国每个县、区、每个厂矿都建立起卫生基层组织。此外，城市的医院病床数也有些发展，今年较去年即增加了百分之二十六。
    第三、动员一切医疗力量为祖国服务。通过了爱国主义的教育，全国卫生人员的政治觉悟已大大提高，许多城市组织了卫生医药界抗美援朝委员会，很多医药卫生人员参加了抗美援朝志愿工作队；私人开业的医生参加公立卫生机构的也日渐增多；有些开业的医生组织了联合医院和诊所，开始参加了地方防疫保健工作。中医和西医的团结也加强了，许多城市中的中医约十八万人已经组织起来，有些城市且已建立了中西医的联合组织。为了使中医更有效地发挥作用，各地创办了中医进修学校及进修班五十七所，使中医能获得基本科学医学知识。妇幼卫生工作方面，我们和各地民主妇女联合会等群众团体取得密切合作，在全国各地大力改造旧产婆，推行新法接生；改造了旧产婆约达十万人；恢复和建立了妇幼保健机构近一千所，接生站一万余处，使初生儿破伤风死亡率大大降低。
    第四、大量培养高、中、初级卫生干部。我国目前医师数量过少，为了解决迫切、大量的干部需要问题，必须改革过去医学教育的制度。因此，我们提倡高等医学院校采用分科重点制，缩短学习年限。这种教育制度已经创造出初步成功的经验。并在医学院中附设专修科，在各地新创办了医士学校和扩充了助产学校和医士学校，以培养中级医疗人才。此外，又大量开办了短期训练班以培养防疫、急救、保健各方面的初级卫生人员，目前高级医学校在校学生已有二万五千人，中级医学校学生已达五万余人。
    第五、争取药材及医疗器材自给。经过两年的努力，药品和医疗器材的自给率已能达到百分之四十八，但若干常用特效药及精密器材目前仍需要从外国输入。我们正在计划发展制药工业，扩大药品和器材的生产，首先争取磺胺、抗疟药、麻醉药等全部自给，青霉素、滴滴涕等部分自给。
    第六、在进行以上工作时，卫生部门得到一个很好的助手，即中国红十字会。如所周知，中国红十字会在解放之前，为反动统治者所控制，腐败不堪，但经过去年改组之后，在人民政府领导之下，面目一新，本“动员人民自救助人”的救济工作方针和“预防为主”的卫生工作方针，先后组织了七个国际医防服务大队六百余人，开赴抗美援朝前后方担任医疗防疫工作。这一时期中也组织了三百多人的医防服务队，担任治淮工程地区及灾区的医防工作，改组了三十八个分会，并组织这些分会和尚未改组但有事业单位的分会，配合当地政府民政卫生部门作了一些卫生治疗工作，分担了保证生产建设中人民健康的重负。现在该会除继续组织力量积极参加抗美援朝和生产救灾之外，正同有关部门和团体大力推进急救教育与急救工作和学校卫生——即红十字少年工作。不过这一群众性的卫生救济团体，是一个新生的团体，尚希大家多予指导和帮助。
    两年来，卫生方面虽然做了如上一些工作，但这些工作离开广大人民的医药卫生要求还很远。由于人民经济生活的改善，对卫生保健的要求必然将日益增高，为了使卫生事业能够满足广大人民的要求，还需要全国一切公私卫生人员，在政府领导之下，更紧密地团结和组织起来为祖国服务。我们还要求各机关、团体和各界人民，协助卫生部门共同推进人民卫生事业，重视这一关系人民生命健康的工作。我们要在中央人民政府和毛主席的领导之下，进一步为改善人民卫生状况提高人民健康水平而奋斗。
