Brief Review of Cultural Life

    Newspapers Should Fully Utilize Pictures for
    Patriotic Propaganda

    Systematically and continuously publishing single-frame pictures in newspapers, accompanied by concise and essential text explanations, to reflect the achievements of the great construction undertakings of the motherland, thereby enhancing and stimulating the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, is one of the best ways to conduct Resist America, Aid Korea, and patriotic propaganda and education.

    According to incomplete statistics, about twelve newspapers at the provincial and municipal levels across the country have published such pictures under various different titles. Among them, China Youth Daily, under the title "Everything for the Motherland," published pictures of young heroes and model figures, as well as pictures of young people working hard and studying for the motherland, providing a model for the broad masses of young people in their work and study. Beijing Worker's Daily, under the title "The Great Chinese Working Class," published daily pictures of the great strength contributed by the Chinese working class to various construction undertakings of the motherland, explaining the idea that only by relying on the working class can our country move towards prosperity and strength. Northeast Daily, under the title "The People's Northeast," introduced daily the inventions and creations in industrial production in the Northeast, demonstrating the creative enthusiasm of the working class. Xi'an Masses Daily, under the title "Our Motherland's Northwest," published daily pictures of people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest working hard to build the Northwest of the motherland, allowing us to see the gradually prosperous scene of the Northwest. The pictures published by the above newspapers are all relatively well done. In addition, the pictures in Shanghai News Daily's "People's New Shanghai," Shanghai Wenhui Daily's "Municipal Construction Serves Production," Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's "Chinese Native Products," Pingyuan Daily's "Love Our Motherland," and Dagang Daily's "People's New Wuhan" also belong to a very good form of propaganda.

    However, some newspapers have not done well enough in the selection of picture themes and photo quality, as well as in printing. Therefore, the expression of the theme is often not powerful enough, or the printing is not clear enough, making it difficult for readers to identify the objects in the pictures, which should be improved. There are also some newspapers that have not fully utilized this form of propaganda that is easily accepted by the masses, and they should also adopt this method when material conditions permit.

    文化生活简评
    报纸应充分利用图片进行
    爱国主义的宣传
    在报纸上有系统地连续刊登单幅图片，并配合简单扼要的文字说明，来反映祖国的伟大建设事业中的成就，从而提高和激发广大人民群众的爱国热情，是进行抗美援朝和爱国主义宣传教育的最好方式之一。
    根据不完全的统计，全国已有十二家左右的省、市以上的报纸，在各种不同的标题下，刊登了这一类的图片。其中，中国青年报以“一切为了祖国”为题，刊登了青年的英雄人物和模范人物，以及青年们为祖国努力工作和学习的图片，给广大青年以工作和学习的榜样；北京工人日报以“伟大的中国工人阶级”为题，逐日刊登了我国工人阶级在祖国各种建设事业中所贡献的伟大力量的图片，说明了为什么必须依靠工人阶级，我们的国家才能走向繁荣富强的这一思想；东北日报以“人民的东北”为题，逐日介绍了东北工业生产中的创造发明，表现了工人阶级的创造热情；西安群众日报以“我们祖国的西北”为题，逐日刊登了西北各民族人民为建设祖国西北而努力的图片，使我们可以看到西北逐渐繁荣的情景。以上各报所刊登的图片都是做得比较好的。此外，上海新闻日报的“人民新上海”、上海文汇报的“市政建设为生产服务”、上海大公报的“中国土特产”、平原日报的“热爱我们的祖国”和大刚报的“人民新武汉”的图片，也属于一种很好的宣传方式。
    但是，有一些报纸对于图片的题材和照片质量的选择，以及印刷方面，都还做得不够好。因此，往往在表现主题上不够有力，或印刷得不够清晰，使读者难以辨认出图片中的事物，这是应该加以改进的。还有一些报纸没有充分地利用这种易为群众接受的宣传方式，也应该在物质条件允许的情况下采用这样方式。
