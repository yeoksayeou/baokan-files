    After this newspaper's "Party Life" column published the article "The CCP Jilin Provincial Committee Decides to Expel Li Lei from the Party" on September 25th, we received letters from seventeen readers. They unanimously expressed their hatred for Li Lei's despicable behavior and their support for the CCP Jilin Provincial Committee's handling of the matter. At the same time, they put forward their own opinions: Li Lei's behavior of molesting and insulting female students and female staff members not only violated Party discipline, but also violated national law, and should be subject to the sanctions of national law.

    The readers' letters also pointed out: In the cultural and educational work front and other work positions, people similar to Li Lei still exist. They refuse criticism from comrades under the pretext that these are "details of life" and "don't be feudal." This cannot be allowed. In order to maintain the purity of the Party and uphold the standards of a Communist Party member, we must learn a lesson from the "Li Lei Incident" and be vigilant against the invasion of corrupt and degenerate ideas.

    要从“李雷事件”中获得教训！
    ——读者来信综述
    本报“党的生活”栏九月二十五日发表了“中共吉林省委决定开除李雷党籍”一文后，先后收到十七个读者的来信，他们对李雷卑鄙的行为，一致表示痛恨，对中共吉林省委对此问题的处理办法表示拥护。同时他们提出了自己的意见：李雷这种调戏与污辱女生和女职员的行为，不仅违反了党的纪律，并且违反了国家法律，应受到国家法律的制裁。
    读者来信中又提出：在文化教育工作阵营里和其它工作岗位上，类似李雷的人还存在着，他们以这是“生活细节”，“不要封建”等为藉口，拒绝同志们的批评。这是不能容许的。为了保持党的纯洁性，保持共产党员的标准，必须从“李雷事件”中获得教训，警惕腐化堕落思想的侵袭。
