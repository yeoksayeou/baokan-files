    To the Editors:

    On the morning of the 12th, we listened to the news of the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and were extremely happy.

    We finished lunch "wolfing it down" and rushed to the China Book Company's first store on Wangfujing Street to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," taking three steps at a time. We thought: since it's the first day of publication and the time is "still early," it certainly won't be crowded. But as soon as we approached the company's entrance, the first thing we saw was a large, dark mass of people – soldiers, workers, teachers, students... lined up in two rows, all holding purchase slips in their hands, packed so tightly that there was no air circulating. A group arrived later, and they couldn't get purchase slips anymore. How much they envied us, how much they complained about being one step too slow!

    "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is a classic work for solving the problems of the Chinese revolution. The reason people are so eager to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and better serve the people.

    Chairman Mao's articles are not difficult to read; Chairman Mao is the most outstanding master of the motherland's language. However, to truly understand Mao Zedong Thought requires arduous study. I hope the newspaper can regularly publish articles expounding on Mao Zedong Thought to guide the people of the whole country in studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

    I promise to study Mao Zedong Thought well and make full use of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" I have purchased. I will implement its entire spirit into my study and work. I want to be a good student of Mao Zedong.

### 我要学习“毛泽东选集”做一个毛泽东的好学生

    我要学习“毛泽东选集”做一个毛泽东的好学生编辑同志：
    十二日早晨，我们收听“毛泽东选集”出版的消息，心里高兴极了。
    我们“狼吞虎咽”地吃完了午饭，三步并成两步地赶到王府井大街中国图书公司第一门市部去买“毛泽东选集”。我们以为：这是出版的头一天，时间“还早”，一定不会挤的。谁知一走近公司的门口，第一眼看见的就是黑压压的一大片人——有战士，有工人，有老师，有学生……排成了双行，手里都拿着购书单，密匝匝地挤得不通风了。后面来了一群，已经领不到购书单了。他们是多么地羡慕我们，多么地抱怨自己走慢了一步啊！
    “毛泽东选集”，是解决中国革命问题的经典著作。人们之所以要这么踊跃地购买“毛泽东选集”，就是要以毛泽东思想来武装自己，更好的为人民服务。
    毛主席的文章并不难读，毛主席是掌握祖国语言最杰出的大师，但是，要想真正懂得毛泽东思想，却需要艰苦地学习。我希望报纸能经常发表阐述毛泽东思想的文章，指导全国人民学习“毛泽东选集”。
    我保证自己好好学习毛泽东思想，将已购得的一部“毛泽东选集”充分利用起来。我要把它的全部精神，贯彻到我的学习和工作中去。我要做一个毛泽东的好学生。
