    Huaibei Salt Bureau Illegally Deducts Workers' Wages
    To the Editor:
    The Huaibei Salt Administration Bureau's enterprise administration does not implement the instructions of higher-level governments, does not take care of workers' lives, and consciously deducts workers' wages.
    The wages of salt workers in Huaibei Salt Field are of two types: one is a fixed hourly wage of one hundred and thirty-five catties of grain (half wheat and half corn) per person per month; the other is a piece-rate wage, that is, two catties of corn are distributed for each dan of white salt produced (half is paid in kind and half is paid in cash). The problem lies in the cash payment. The North Jiangsu People's Administrative Office forwarded the notice of the Finance Department of the East China Military and Political Committee on May 14 of this year, canceling the fiscal grain price of May last year and changing to the grain price of April this year as the standard for issuing various wages. The bureau received the notice on May 19. According to the grain price in April in various towns of Huaibei Salt Field, each catty of grain was equivalent to 690 yuan. However, the Huaibei Salt Administration Bureau did not comply with the higher-level regulations and still evaluated the grain price in the name of the Salt Field Evaluation Committee, setting the price of each catty of corn at 500 yuan for May, June, and July. According to Liu Yuexian, deputy section chief of the bureau's accounting section, "Salt workers receive approximately 1.4 billion yuan less." The Huaibei Salt Special Zone Federation of Trade Unions repeatedly urged the bureau to make up the difference of 1.4 billion yuan according to the fiscal grain price in April, and the CPC Huaibei Salt Special Zone Committee also made a decision in mid-August, requiring the bureau to make up the difference from May, but the bureau has not yet made up the difference. It is hoped that the bureau will promptly investigate and deal with this matter and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

### 淮北盐务局非法克扣工人工资

    淮北盐务局非法克扣工人工资编辑同志：
    淮北盐务管理局企业行政方面不执行上级政府指示，不照顾工人生活，有意识地克扣工人工资。
    淮北盐场产盐工人的工资有两种：一种是固定计时工资，每月每人为一百三十五斤粮（小麦、苞米各半）；一种是计件工资，即产一担白盐分得二斤苞米（一半发实物，一半发代金）。问题就出在发代金上面。苏北人民行政公署曾于本年五月十四日转发了华东军政委员会财政部的通知，取消去年五月份财政粮价，改以今年四月份粮价作为发放各项工资的标准。该局在五月十九日就收到了通知。按照淮北盐场各市镇四月份粮价计算，每斤粮合六百九十元。但淮北盐务管理局不遵上级规定，仍以盐场评价委员会的名义进行评议粮价，评定五、六、七三个月每斤苞米价为五百元。据该局会计科副科长刘曰贤说：“盐工们少得约达十四亿元。”淮北盐特区总工会曾再三催促要该局照四月份财政粮价补发十四亿元差额，中共淮北盐特区委员会也于八月中旬作出决定，要该局从五月份起照补差额，而该局至今仍未照补。希望该局迅速检查处理，并将处理结果在报纸上公布。
