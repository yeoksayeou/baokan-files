Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th: The Tibetan people, both monks and laypeople, and over 6,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet which has returned to the embrace of the motherland, held a rally on the square in front of the Potala Palace on the 1st to warmly celebrate National Day. Representatives from the Tibetan local government and the three major monasteries of Drepung, Sera, and Ganden participated in the presidium. This was an unprecedented grand gathering in the history of Lhasa. Tibetan monks and laypeople showed great interest in the birth of their motherland. Early in the morning, many residents and shops began listening to the live broadcast of the celebration from Tiananmen Square in the capital, Beijing. Both inside and outside the city, incense was burned to celebrate in accordance with Tibetan customs, and crowds of men and women in festive attire flocked to the venue. The venue was adorned with twenty striking large and small five-star red flags, and huge banners written in both Tibetan and Chinese surrounded the venue, reading "Resolutely Implement the Peaceful Agreement," "Build Tibet," "Consolidate National Defense," "Tibetan People Unite to Expel Imperialist Forces from Tibet," and "Long Live Chairman Mao, the Great Leader of All Nationalities in China," which were extremely eye-catching under the sunlight.

The大会 opened to the sound of military music. After the national flag-raising ceremony, General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, spoke. General Zhang said: "Today, as a good start has been made in the unity and equality of all nationalities in Tibet, celebrating National Day in Lhasa for the first time has great historical significance." He then reported on the great achievements of the motherland's various constructions over the past year, as well as the great victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Finally, General Zhang reiterated the spirit of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the ethnic policies of the Central People's Government, and called on the People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet to unite closely with the Tibetan monks and laypeople under the leadership of Chairman Mao to build a new Tibet.

Ren Xie (official title) Chisong Pingkang, the representative of the Tibetan local government, then spoke. He said, "Today, the Tibetan monks and laypeople are very happy to celebrate National Day together with the People's Liberation Army." In his speech, he praised the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet for completely eliminating the estrangement between the Tibetan and Han brothers caused by the reactionary rulers in history. He congratulated the eternal close unity of all nationalities in China, and wished good health to Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities, and good health to the Dalai Lama.

Next was a speech by General Wang Qimei of the advance contingent of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet. He emphasized that the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet is an army of the Tibetan monks and laypeople. This army will faithfully serve the Tibetan people, resolutely implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, respect the customs and religious beliefs of the Tibetan people, expel imperialist aggressive forces from Tibet, and consolidate national defense.

At the rally, the telegram from the Tibetan local government to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government congratulating National Day, and the telegram of respect from the advance contingent entering Tibet to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Chinese People's Volunteers were read out. The Tibetan monks and laypeople and the People's Liberation Army present at the meeting constantly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities!" "Long live the great unity of all nationalities in China!"

On this day, hundreds and thousands of monks and laypeople, according to Tibetan customs, went to the lawn in front of the Potala Palace and the Lin Garden to set up tents, hold picnics and sing and dance. Until dusk, the singing continued.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th: Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, hosted a banquet for important monks and lay officials of the Tibetan local government at 5 pm on National Day. Mr. Shen Shumei, the Indian representative stationed in Lhasa, and representatives from Nepal and Bhutan were also invited to participate. There were more than 60 guests.

During the banquet, Representative Zhang gave a speech, briefly outlining the great achievements of China's various constructions and the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea over the past year, and toasted to the good health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities, and the Dalai Lama.

Lhalu, the chief Kalon of the Tibetan local government, stood up and thanked Representative Zhang on behalf of all the officials attending the banquet, and said that since the signing of the peaceful liberation agreement in Beijing, the Han and Tibetan nationalities have united. Lhalu Kalon also toasted to the health of the Dalai Lama and Chairman Mao.
