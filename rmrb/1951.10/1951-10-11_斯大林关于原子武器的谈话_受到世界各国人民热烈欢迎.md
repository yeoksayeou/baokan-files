Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: Marshal Stalin's talk on atomic weapons has received great attention from the media in Western Europe and the Americas. Not only the organs of the Communist Parties and other progressive newspapers in these countries, but even many national bourgeois newspapers have published the full text or excerpts of Stalin's talk in the most important positions. The Associated Press, United Press International, and Agence France-Presse all released detailed summaries of Stalin's talk. Radio stations in various countries also rebroadcast the full text or summaries of the talk. Swedish Radio broadcasted the summary of the talk twice on October 6th.

Many newspapers have published editorials commenting on Stalin's talk. In their comments, reactionary newspapers in various countries could not hide their fear and frustration, while progressive newspapers in various countries unanimously expressed warm welcome.

The organs of the Communist Parties of various countries, such as the French "l'Humanité," the British "Daily Worker," the American "Daily Worker," the Dutch "De Waarheid," the Belgian "Le Drapeau Rouge," the Finnish "Kansan Uutiset," the Danish "Land og Folk," and the Swedish "Göteborgs-Posten," have all published special commentaries. They unanimously pointed out that Stalin's talk powerfully struck at the war-mongers, greatly promoted the cause of peace, and called on the people to fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The French "l'Humanité" wrote: Comrade Stalin's statement is another great contribution to the cause of defending peace. This statement forces everyone who threatens the people of the world with terrible danger to consider it. Comrade Stalin's statement and his specific proposal to ban atomic weapons will surely be supported by all peace-loving people. The Finnish "Kansan Uutiset" pointed out: Every statement by Stalin is a significant event for all peace-loving humanity. This statement points out the path to fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons and world peace. The Dutch "De Waarheid" wrote: "Stalin's statement has once again severely hit the plans of the American war-mongers and their desire to issue orders to the world with a policy of atomic violence. ... The whole world knows that Hitler had to abandon the use of poison gas when he knew he would be severely retaliated against. The possibility of preventing another world war is growing day by day. This possibility must be a new encouragement for the friends of peace, encouraging them to work harder to collect signatures for demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace pact."

Indian and Pakistani Newspapers Publish Comments
Support the Soviet Union's Proposal to Ban Atomic Weapons

This Newspaper News: According to Xinhua News Agency: Many newspapers in India and Pakistan have published Marshal Stalin's talk to the Pravda reporter on atomic weapons and comments on Stalin's talk.

The Indian "National Herald" published Stalin's answers to the Pravda reporter under the title "Soviet Union Advocates Absolute Prohibition of Atomic Weapons" on the first page. "The Free Press Journal" published Stalin's answers to the reporter, with the headline "Comrade Stalin Says: American and British War-mongers Forced the Soviet Union to Manufacture Atomic Bombs. We Do Not Want to Be Unarmed When Attacked. American Rulers Have No Reason to Panic Unless They Commit Aggression." "The Free Press Journal" published an editorial on the 8th, saying: The peace-loving people of the world warmly welcome Stalin's talk. The Soviet Union's proposed international control of atomic weapons is urgently needed for peace, but the American war-mongers have always rejected such control, attempting to monopolize the production of atomic bombs. The editorial continued: "After the Stockholm Conference of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress last year put forward the demand to ban atomic bombs, 500 million people around the world signed the Stockholm Declaration. They welcome Comrade Stalin's statement and will demand the prohibition of atomic bombs with greater strength and confidence."

"The Hindustan Times" editorial commented on Stalin's answers to the reporter, saying: "Stalin emphasized that the Soviet Union was forced to manufacture atomic bombs not for aggression, but to defend the Soviet Union. He completely denied any intention of invading the United States. Regarding the issue of international control, Stalin said: The Soviet Union advocates the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international control, while the United States wants to continue producing these weapons."

The Bombay "Free Press Journal" published an editorial on the 7th commenting on Stalin's talk, saying: "The United States' monopoly of that weapon for several years after the war and its military supremacy have now been deflated." The editorial, in talking about the efforts of the Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Malik, to control atomic weapons, said: "The Atomic Energy Commission, under the instructions of the United States, rejected the proposal to control atomic weapons." "The Free Press Journal" believes that "for world peace, the control of atomic energy is necessary."

Pakistan's "Anjam" and "Today" published the full text of Stalin's answers to the Pravda reporter on the issue of atomic weapons. Both newspapers' comments emphasized that Stalin said that the Soviet Union had no intention of attacking any country, and the Soviet Union continued to advocate the prohibition of atomic weapons; the Soviet Union's possession of atomic weapons deprived the American ruling group of its monopoly on this weapon, thus benefiting the cause of peace.

"Today"’s editorial said: "The whole world knows that atomic bombs are destructive weapons. Obviously, the Soviet Union also has atomic weapons, and the United States is no longer the monopoly holder. Because the Soviet Union also has atomic weapons, it can now be expected that the universal demand to ban atomic weapons will be accepted."

    印度和巴基斯坦报纸发表评论
    拥护苏联禁止原子武器的主张
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：印度和巴基斯坦许多报纸都刊登了斯大林大元帅关于原子武器向真理报记者发表的谈话和关于斯大林谈话的评论。
    印度的“国民先驱报”以“苏联主张绝对禁止原子武器”为题在第一版上刊载了斯大林关于原子武器问题的答真理报记者问。 “自由报”发表斯大林的答记者问，标题为“斯大林同志说：美英战争贩子使苏联不得不制造原子弹。我们不愿在受到进攻时没有武装。美国统治者如果不进行侵略，他们就没有惊慌的理由。”“自由报”八日发表社论说：全世界爱好和平的人民热烈欢迎斯大林的谈话。苏联主张的关于原子武器的国际管制是和平所迫切需要的，但是，美国战争贩子却一直拒绝这种管制，企图垄断原子弹的生产。社论接着说：“去年世界保卫和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议提出禁止原子弹的要求以后，全世界有五万万人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。他们欢迎斯大林同志的声明，并将以更大的力量和信心来要求禁止原子弹。”
    “印度斯坦时报”社论评斯大林答记者问说：“斯大林强调指出：苏联被迫制造原子弹不是为了进行侵略，而是为了保卫苏联。他完全否认有任何侵略美国的意图，关于国际管制问题，斯大林说：苏联主张禁止原子武器和建立国际管制，美国则想继续生产这种武器。”
    孟买“自由新闻”七日发表社论评论斯大林的谈话说：“美国在战后数年垄断那种武器，在军事上唯我独尊的气概，这一下可泄了气了。”社论在谈到苏联驻联合国代表马立克为管制原子武器而作的努力时说：“原子能委员会在美国的授意之下，拒绝了管制原子武器的建议。”“自由新闻”认为：“为了世界和平，原子能的管制是必要的。”
    巴基斯坦的“安杰姆报”和“今天报”发表了斯大林关于原子武器问题答真理报记者问的全文。两报的评论都强调指出：斯大林说苏联无意进攻任何国家，苏联继续主张禁止原子武器；苏联的拥有原子武器剥夺了美国统治集团对于这种武器的垄断，因而有益于和平事业。
    “今天报”的社论说：“全世界都知道原子弹是毁灭性的武器。很显然，苏联也有了原子武器，美国已经不再是垄断者。因为苏联也有了原子武器，现在可以期望禁止原子武器的普遍要求将被接受。”
