    Creative Labor
    – A Corner of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4
    Tian Liu
    The maintenance workers of the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4, responding to the call to increase production and practice economy, used creative labor to repair all the machines in the factory. After the machines were repaired, the weight of the shoes became consistent, the edges of the shoes became uniform, and the quality was greatly improved. This not only allowed every soldier and working people wearing rubber shoes to have better shoes to wear, but also saved 15 grams of rubber per pair of shoes, saving the country raw materials worth 2,600 tons of grain in half a year.
    In May of this year, the shoe-pressing machine in the pressing workshop of the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4 had already begun to show signs of wear – the machines had been used for a long time, and the "notch" part of the shoe mold gradually became larger, and the "shoe last" gradually thinned, seriously affecting the quality of the shoes.
    The workers were very worried about this matter. The workshop director had also held several worker symposiums and technical worker meetings to find a good way to repair the shoe-pressing machine. However, there were few machine repair workers. There were only nine maintenance workers in the entire workshop. Because of the continuous production in three shifts day and night, the nine maintenance workers were divided into three groups, following the production "three shifts", three people took care of dozens of machines in the entire workshop, checking here, repairing there, knocking and hitting, and they were too busy, how could they spare people to specialize in repairing machines? Adding people, firstly, did not conform to "economic accounting," and secondly, there was a shortage of technical workers everywhere in the past two years of great industrial development, where to find them?
    The problem became more and more serious. The shoes made in June not only had uneven weights, but also had thick and thin edges. According to the national standard for raw material consumption, two tons of raw rubber were wasted. It happened that the task of increasing production and practicing economy came down at this time. The workers in other workshops came up with various methods to increase production and save money. They exceeded the task given by the superiors by more than 14% at once, creating excess wealth equal to twice the total assets of the entire factory. It depended on the pressing workshop. If the shoe-pressing machine was not repaired, not to mention ruining the labor achievements of increasing production and practicing economy of the workers in the entire factory, I am afraid that the task would not be completed!
    There is a 20-year-old maintenance worker in the pressing workshop named Chen Shoufa. Despite his young age, he is an "old technical worker" with a full ten years of service. In early July, he heard the factory director convey Comrade Gao Gang's call for "increasing production and practicing economy by 5 million tons of grain", which had such a great effect on consolidating national defense, building industry, and improving people's lives, and wanted to participate in the increase production and practice economy movement by repairing the shoe-pressing machine. He first discussed this idea with the other two maintenance workers in his group, Shao Chunren and Yang Shaowu. When the two heard it, it was exactly what they wanted. They all said, "As long as we do it, are there any difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of our workers?" After several days of discussion and research, the three of them came up with various methods such as reasonably using working time, appropriately dividing labor, closely cooperating, and scientifically organizing the workplace. In this way, they could "follow the production", while ensuring safe production, while squeezing time to repair machines, and creating excess wealth for the country. Their determination and plan immediately received enthusiastic support from the Party, the trade union and the administration of the workshop. However, many people thought this was a bold attempt, and even the old technical workers who had worked in the factory for many years shook their heads secretly.
    Before starting to repair the machine, Chen Shoufa and the others made thorough preparations: how to check all the machines thoroughly before taking over the shift; how to establish a good liaison system with the shoe-pressing workers, and notify them for repairs at any time when a fault occurs; even who disassembles the machine, who prepares the raw materials, who prepares the tools, etc., all have specific arrangements. But this is after all a bold and courageous act that no one has dared to do before. Therefore, when they implemented their plan and unloaded the machine for repair, the three of them became very nervous: they were worried that the machine that was still in production would break down, and they were afraid that the time for repairing the machine would be prolonged, delaying production. The three of them couldn't even say a word, and started operating nervously.
    In the hot weather of July, after bending over to check the machine, they lay on the "bed" and worked hard. The sweat flowed into their eyes, stinging painfully, and they couldn't take time to wipe it off; their waists were sore, and they couldn't bear to stand up and move their muscles and bones, "Every minute is a precious moment of labor!"
    After five hours of hard work, it was finally repaired successfully. Chen Shoufa's creative labor not only saved the country four technical workers and the required wages, but also increased the production time of each machine by 31 hours because it shortened the repair time. (In the past, it took two technical workers 36 hours to repair a machine like this.) One machine can produce 233 more pairs of shoes. Just the labor and time saved by repairing dozens of shoe-pressing machines in the factory created more than 60 million yuan of wealth for the country. As for the improvement of product quality and the excess value created by raw material savings after the machine was repaired, it was even greater.
    Increasing production and practicing economy, creating excess wealth for the country, who would be willing to be worse than whom? The other six maintenance workers in the other two groups, seeing that Chen Shoufa and the others had succeeded in the experiment, also did the same. The nine people worked together and repaired all the dozens of machines in the factory in more than ten days.

    创造性的劳动
    ——记东北橡胶四厂增产节约运动的一角
    田流
    东北橡胶四厂的保全工人，响应增产节约的号召，以创造性的劳动，修改好了全厂的机器。机器修改后，鞋子的重量一致了，鞋边均匀了，质量大大提高，不光使每个穿胶鞋的战士和劳动人民能够有更好的鞋子穿，每双鞋子还节省十五克胶，半年为国家节约原料的价值等于二千六百吨粮食。
    今年五月间，东北橡胶四厂压成车间的压鞋机，就已经发生了磨损现象——机器用的日久了，鞋模子上的“缺口”部分慢慢地大起来，“鞋楦子”又渐渐瘦下去，严重地影响着鞋子的质量。
    工友们为这件事都很着急。车间主任也曾召开过好几次工人座谈会、技术工人会议，想找出个修改压鞋机的好办法。但是机器修理工人少，全车间总共才有九个保全工人。因为是日夜三班的连续生产，九个保全工分成三个小组，跟着生产“三班倒”，三个人照顾着全车间好几十台机器，检查检查这儿，修理修理那儿，敲敲打打，就忙得不可开交，哪能再抽出人来去专门修理机器呢？添人吧，一来不合“经济核算”，二来这二年工业大发展，技术工人到处缺，到那去找呢？
    问题越来越严重，六月份做出的鞋子不光有分量不一般重，鞋边有厚有薄等毛病，按着国家规定的原材料消耗标准，还浪费了两吨生胶。碰巧增产节约的任务又在这时候下来了，别的车间工友们想出了各种办法，你增产他节约，一下子超过上级给的任务百分之十四多，要创造等于全厂资产总值两倍那么大的超额财富。就看压成车间的了，要是压鞋机不修改，别说毁坏了全厂工友增产节约的劳动成果，怕连任务还完不成呢！
    压成车间有个二十岁的保全工人，名叫陈守发，别看年纪小，是个“老技术工人”呢，已有整整的十年工龄了。七月初，他听到厂长传达高岗同志号召的“增产节约五百万吨粮食”，对巩固国防、建设工业、改善人民生活有那么大作用，就想用修改好压鞋机，来参加增产节约运动。他把这个主意先和本组的那两位保全工人邵纯仁、杨绍武去商量，二人一听，正合心思，都说：“只要干就行，在咱工人面前，还有克服不了的困难吗？”经过几天的讨论研究，他三人想出了合理地运用工作时间，恰当分工、密切配合及科学地组织工作场所等种种办法，这样就可以“随着生产走”，一面保证安全生产，一面挤时间修改机器，为国家创造超额财富。他们的决心和计划立刻得到了车间党、工会和行政的热烈支持。可是也有不少人认为这是个大胆的尝试，连在本厂作工多年的老技术工人也暗暗摇头。
    陈守发他们在开始修改机器前，作了周密的准备工作：怎样在接班前，把所有的机器，都普遍地检查一遍；怎样同压鞋工人建立好连系制度，发生故障随时通知检修；甚至连谁拆卸机器，谁准备原材料，谁准备工具等等，都有了具体安排。但这毕竟是件从没有人敢这样做的大胆而勇敢的行为，因此，当他们实行自己的计划，把机器卸下来修理时，三个人都十分紧张起来：既耽心仍在进行生产的机器发生故障，又怕修改机器的时间拖长，误了生产。三个人连句话也顾不得说，便紧张地操作起来。
    七月大热天，刚折腰曲背地检查完机器，又伏在“床子”上紧张劳作，汗流进眼里蛰的生疼，顾不得擦一把；腰累得发酸，也舍不得站起来活动活动筋骨，“每分钟都是宝贵的劳动时刻啊！”
    经过五个钟头的紧张劳作，到底修改成功了。陈守发他们的创造性劳动，不仅替国家节省下四个技术工人和所需要的工资，还因为缩短了修理时间，使每台机器增加了三十一个小时的生产时间。（过去，像这样修改机器，需要两个技术工人，三十六小时才能修改完毕）一台机器就能多生产二百三十三双鞋子，全厂数十台压鞋机，光修理时节省的人工和时间两项，就为国家创造了六千万元以上的财富。至于修改后的机器对产品质量的改善，和原材料节约创造的超额价值就更多更大了。
    增产节约，为国家创造超额财富，谁肯比谁差呢？其余两个组的六位保全工人，见陈守发他们已经试验成功，也照样作起来，九个人一齐努力，十几天工夫，就把全厂好几十台机器统统修改好了。
