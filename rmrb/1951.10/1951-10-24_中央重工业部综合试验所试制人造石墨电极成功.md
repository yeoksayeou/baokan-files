To the Editors:

The Central Heavy Industry Ministry's Comprehensive Testing Institute has successfully trialed artificial graphite electrodes. Artificial graphite electrodes play a very important role in heavy industry, being indispensable in electric arc furnace steelmaking, manufacturing carborundum, electrolytic furnace lead production, and other processes. In the past, the electrodes used in our country's factories relied entirely on foreign imports; after liberation, artificial graphite electrodes became difficult to buy, leading to supply difficulties. In order to break the imperialist economic blockade and establish a people's artificial graphite electrode industry, the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Ministry entrusted this work to the Comprehensive Research Institute in June 1950. After overcoming difficulties such as frequent mold cracking during a year of experimentation, the staff of the institute's electrochemistry department finally achieved success.

    中央重工业部综合试验所试制人造石墨电极成功编辑同志：
    中央重工业部综合试验所试制人造石墨电极成功。人造石墨电极在重工业上有很重要的地位，如电弧炉炼钢、制造金钢砂、电解炉制铅等都少不了它。过去，我国工厂所用电极，完全依赖外货输入；解放后，人造石墨电极不易买到，致供应发生困难。中央重工业部化学工业局为了打破帝国主义的经济封锁，以及建立人民的人造石墨电极工业，于一九五○年六月将此项工作交综合研究所研究。该所电化室的工作人员在一年的试验中克服了模子常生裂纹等困难后，终于获得成功。
