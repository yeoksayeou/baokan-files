    Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance and Strive for the Economic Construction of New China!
    —Letter from Workers of Jin Sheng Textile Factory in Taiyuan to the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group

    Dear Cotton Farmer Comrades of the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group:

    When we learned that your group had broken the highest cotton production record in Chinese history by increasing the yield per mu by 287 jin compared to last year, the workers all said happily: peasant brothers are our workers' closest and most reliable friends. Because you have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, not only actively planting cotton, but also guaranteeing to sell the cotton to the state. This supports the cotton supply of the national cotton textile industry, and the factory will not have to stop production due to a shortage of cotton. To respond to the enthusiasm of our peasant brothers, on the basis of doing a good job in the democratic reform movement, we have changed the original 23-count yarn to 22-count yarn, and the quality has been improved to 98.4%, so the woven cloth is also stronger.

    When we spin yarn and weave cloth, we always remember your hard work. We also often think: only when our workers and peasants are closely united, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, can we live a good life forever. Therefore, we hope that you will improve cotton seeds, promote your advanced experience, and work with us workers to develop the economic construction of New China!

    All Workers of Jin Sheng Textile Factory in Taiyuan

    巩固工农联盟，为新中国的经济建设努力！
    ——太原晋生纺织厂工人给曲耀离互助组的信曲耀离互助组的棉农兄弟们：
    当我们知道了你组以每亩产棉比去年增加二百八十七斤的数字打破中国历史上产棉的最高纪录后，工人都高兴地说：农民兄弟真是我们工人最亲密、最可靠的朋友。因为你们发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，不仅积极地植棉，而且保证把棉花卖给国家。这样，就支持了全国棉纺工业的棉花供应，工厂也就不会因缺棉而停工。为了回答农民兄弟们的热情，我们在搞好民主改革运动的基础上，把原纺的二十三支纱改为二十二支纱，质量已提高到百分之九十八点四，因而织出来的布也更结实了。
    我们在纺纱织布的时候，时时刻刻怀念着你们的辛劳。我们也常想：只有咱们工人农民紧紧地团结起来，在毛主席的领导下，才能永远过好日子。因此，我们希望你们改良棉种，推广你们的先进经验，和我们工人一块儿为发展新中国的经济建设而努力！
    太原晋生纺织厂全体工人
