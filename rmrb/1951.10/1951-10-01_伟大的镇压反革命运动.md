    The Great Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement
    Luo Ruiqing
    Relying on the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the young People's Republic of China, based on the policy of combining suppression with leniency, launched an unprecedented suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement throughout the country. This movement, with unparalleled force, dealt a devastating blow to the remaining forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. Currently, a large number of ringleaders, habitual bandits, local despots, secret agents, key members of reactionary parties and organizations who are resolute counter-revolutionaries, and leaders of reactionary secret societies have been arrested throughout the country. Among them, a large number of the most heinous criminals who owe many blood debts and have committed extremely serious crimes against the people and the motherland, whose execution is not enough to appease public anger, have been executed; a large number of counter-revolutionaries have been sentenced to imprisonment and are being forced to undergo labor reform; and another group is still in custody and under interrogation. Thus far, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in the vast majority of areas of the country has reached a thorough or relatively thorough stage. This victorious struggle has not only fundamentally destroyed the remaining reactionary forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism on the Chinese mainland, but also further mobilized and educated the broad masses of people, strengthened the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidated the rear for resisting America and aiding Korea, and ensured the smooth progress of national construction.
    Facts have proved that resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries is an essential step for the Chinese people to implement the people's democratic dictatorship and consolidate and develop their victory. This is because although the dark rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang has been overthrown, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces they left behind have not been eliminated. In the Southwest region alone, there were 80,000 secret agents and hundreds of thousands of bandits left behind by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang at the beginning of liberation. In addition, there were a large number of key members of reactionary parties and organizations, members of the Kuomintang army and government who persisted in their counter-revolutionary stance, leaders of reactionary secret societies, and local despots. In other newly liberated areas, although there were fewer bandits than in the Southwest region, the situation of other counter-revolutionaries was similar. These people were the foundation of the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the past, and the number of Chinese people who sacrificed themselves at their hands in the struggle for freedom and liberation is incalculable. In Mianchi County, Henan Province alone, more than 7,000 revolutionary cadres and masses died at the hands of counter-revolutionaries from the Anti-Japanese War to before liberation. After the national victory, they continued to spread rumors and sabotage national construction everywhere, and even organized armed riots, dreaming of subverting the people's regime. The US-Chiang bandit gang relied on them as internal support to carry out restoration activities. In fact, their sabotage activities have caused great harm to the people and the country. For example, counter-revolutionaries lurking in Guangxi organized many riots of varying scales last year, killing 7,219 revolutionary cadres and masses, burning down more than 25,600 houses, and robbing more than 200,000 head of cattle. Liu Zhao'an, a farmer in Banli Village, Liujiang County, had his entire family of 51 people spanning four generations completely wiped out by the bandit leader Liu Fu. The people hated these heinous counter-revolutionaries extremely, calling them "Little Chiang Kai-sheks" and demanding that the People's Government adopt a firm policy to thoroughly eliminate them. Otherwise, the lives and property of the people and national construction would not have a definite guarantee, and in other words, consolidating and developing the fruits of the revolution would become inconceivable.
    In accordance with the demands of the broad masses of people, the people's governments at all levels quickly corrected the "boundless leniency" tendency that had once existed, and adopted resolute measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Especially since the promulgation of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" in February this year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, with the joint efforts of people's governments at all levels, communist party committees at all levels, democratic parties, and people's organizations, and through the hard work of public security organs, judicial and procuratorial departments at all levels, the broad masses of people across the country were mobilized and organized to launch a vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. Since then, the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries has dropped sharply, and their internal ranks have been in a state of chaos. A large number of leading counter-revolutionaries have been arrested, detained, and executed. Bandits, local despots, secret agents, key members of reactionary parties and organizations, and leaders of reactionary secret societies, the five types of enemies, have suffered extremely severe blows. Many counter-revolutionaries, finding themselves with no way out, were forced to repent and surrender to the People's Government, handing over organizational lists, documents, weapons, etc., and admitting their guilt. Batches and groups of bandits surrendered, disintegrated, or were annihilated. Bandits have been basically eliminated in several provinces with many bandits, such as Guangxi. A small number of die-hard counter-revolutionaries trembled in fear in the giant hands of the people, temporarily daring not to act rashly. The remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the warmongers Truman, Marshall, and Acheson were also terrified and lamented endlessly. People from all walks of life across the country were overjoyed, applauded and cheered, and the People's Government's reputation resounded throughout the country.
    In the massive suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the political understanding of people from all walks of life has undergone profound changes, and their sense of being masters of their own affairs and their patriotic enthusiasm have been greatly enhanced and improved. They actively assist the People's Public Security Organs in eliminating counter-revolutionaries, which is a direct result of vigorous propaganda work. During the movement, various representative meetings, cadre meetings, symposiums, and mass meetings were held in various places from large and medium-sized cities to small cities, as well as in the vast rural areas. The scale and impact of these meetings were unprecedented. At these meetings, victims made accusations, and evidence of counter-revolutionary crimes was exhibited. In addition, various places used radio rallies, movies, slides, operas, newspapers, pamphlets, and leaflets to carry out extensive propaganda work. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, a total of 29,626 mass meetings of various types were held, with a cumulative total of more than 3,379,000 people participating. From March to July, Tianjin held 21,400 mass meetings of various types, with a cumulative total of 2,200,000 participants. Shanghai organized more than 800 exhibitions of different sizes and distributed a large number of propaganda materials, with 2.4 million copies of the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" alone, averaging one copy for every two people in the city. According to incomplete statistics from eight special districts and four cities in Hebei Province, a total of 653 trial and accusation meetings were held, with more than 3,900,000 people participating, and 3,693 victims accused the counter-revolutionary criminals of their crimes. Through the above work, the broad masses of people across the country received a profound education in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In the Central and Southern Region, more than 60% of the total population received this education. In Fujian Province, more than 70% of the total population received education. In Nanjing, more than 80% of the citizens were educated. As a result, the awareness of the broad masses of people has been greatly improved, and they have risen up to assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. According to statistics, since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries began in Northeast China until August, a total of 160,000 letters of accusation and secret reports from the masses have been received. Shanghai received more than 33,000 letters of accusation, reporting nearly 29,000 counter-revolutionaries. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, a large number of activists emerged from the masses. According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau, a total of 12,468 activists of various types emerged in the city, including 132 model workers for anti-espionage. In Hebei Province, there were 444 activists who prepared their own travel expenses to investigate counter-revolutionaries in remote areas, 1,318 who refused bribes and were not afraid of sacrifice, 1,394 who helped the government arrest counter-revolutionaries, 88,055 who actively carried out propaganda, and 13,586 other activists of various types.
    The great suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement has strengthened the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidated the rear for the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and completely established the dominance of the masses throughout the country, creating a nationwide stability that has never been seen in history. In the old liberated areas of Northeast China, from cities to villages, bandits have disappeared, and social order is peaceful. For example, since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Harbin and Qiqihar, there have been no cases of bandits. In the provinces of Rehe, Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Jilin, where bandits were rampant for a time last year, with frequent incidents of robbery and sabotage, bandit activities have been reduced unprecedentedly this year, with only more than 30 scattered bandits found. Compared with last year, incidents of robbery and sabotage have been reduced by 95%. Therefore, the peasants call the suppression of counter-revolutionaries a real liberation, and the workers call it the second "August 15th". Before the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, 80% of the villages in Fugou County, Henan Province, were controlled by local despots and landlords. Now, all villages in the county have established the dominance of the masses. In Liancheng County, Fujian, there were more than 2,500 bandits and secret agents in the past, and all six districts in the county had been attacked by bandits, and the county seat was attacked twice. Now, bandits have been eliminated, and after the removal of counter-revolutionaries, the rural regime has been completely in the hands of the people themselves.
    The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement has raised the political awareness of the masses and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, thus also creating favorable conditions for national construction. Workers and staff in various factories and mines have listed the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as the main item in their patriotic pacts, and have voluntarily organized "safety groups" and "factory protection teams", which has greatly reduced sabotage accidents. For example, from March to June, the employees of Qixin Cement Plant and two other enterprises in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, submitted a total of 480 safety suggestions. Compared with last year, accidents in various factories and mines in the city have decreased by 60%. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the rural masses in some areas where the level of awareness was not yet high completely broke with the "change of dynasty" thinking and changed the state of "not daring to ask for land distribution, not daring to live in distributed houses, and not having the mind to produce". Their enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high, and they generally responded: "This time it's reliable."
    Although the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement has achieved great success, the problem has not been completely solved, that is, the counter-revolutionaries have not been completely eliminated. Regionally speaking, the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries has not been carried out thoroughly in some areas, and even a few areas have not been touched at all. There are such areas in all major administrative regions, especially in the new areas; as for the areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, or where land reform has been carried out but not thoroughly, the problem is even more complicated. In terms of the degree of打击打击打击打击打击hitting the five types of counter-revolutionaries, it is also not thorough, especially in the new areas. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the main打击打击打击打击打击hitting was on bandits and local despots. For example, in the East China region, bandit leaders, habitual bandits, and local despots accounted for 73.5% of the total number of executions. The situation in other areas is similar. Although a certain degree of打击打击打击打击打击hitting has also been given to secret agents and resolute counter-revolutionary members of reactionary parties and organizations, it is generally not enough; a certain degree of打击打击打击打击打击hitting has also been given to the leaders of reactionary secret societies, but as a counter-revolutionary organization, the reactionary secret societies have not been completely destroyed. From the perspective of mobilizing the masses, because the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement has not been carried out thoroughly in some areas, the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries is still rampant in these places, the people have not been able to avenge their enemies, and they still dare not raise their heads. For example, in some counties in Shanxi Province, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement has not been carried out in one-third of the villages, and the masses still doubt whether the government will support them and dare not rise up to fight. Even in those places where counter-revolutionaries have been arrested and executed, there are still some counties that have not carried out vigorous propaganda to mobilize the masses to actively participate in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and the masses have not been mobilized, and even have many concerns, such as fearing that the escaped counter-revolutionaries will not be captured, fearing that the counter-revolutionaries will retaliate, etc. From the above three aspects, how to continue to consolidate and develop the victory, more thoroughly打击打击打击打击打击hit the enemy, and more deeply carry out the regular struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries is still a serious task for the people of the whole country in the future. In order to achieve this task, it is necessary to:
    First, in all areas where the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is not yet thorough, all counter-revolutionaries who should be arrested but have not yet been arrested must be arrested; and they shall be dealt with immediately in accordance with the provisions of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" to meet the demands of the masses. When carrying out this work, neither can we be slack or complacent, nor can we exaggerate the enemy's strength. Therefore, on the one hand, we need to rely on the strong leadership of the higher-level leading organs, and on the other hand, we need to rely on the strict investigation and research of professional organs and further obtain the support and assistance of the broad masses of people, so as to ensure that the five types of counter-revolutionaries, such as bandits, local despots, secret agents, resolute anti-revolutionary members of reactionary parties and organizations, and leaders of reactionary secret societies, are thoroughly eliminated. As for all counter-revolutionaries who have fled to other places and should be arrested, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to arrest them in every possible way, so that they can be brought to justice. In the process of clearing up backlog cases, as long as the leading criminals among the counter-revolutionaries who have not yet been sentenced are indeed guilty of heinous crimes and have aroused great public anger, and whose execution is necessary to appease public anger, they should be resolutely sentenced to death without hesitation. When carrying out all the above work, it must be closely combined with the ongoing movement to resist America and aid Korea, eliminate bandits and oppose local despots, reduce rent and return deposits, and carry out land reform in the local area, so as to achieve the effect of mutual promotion.
    The second is to clear up backlog cases and carry out labor reform for counter-revolutionaries. Now, the work of clearing up backlog cases has been carried out for four months, and many valuable experiences have been gained, among which the most important is the experience of implementing the mass line in clearing up backlog cases. That is, to explain the entire policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to the masses clearly, to hand over counter-revolutionary cases familiar to the masses to the masses for discussion, and the masses can put forward preliminary opinions on sentencing, and then the cases will be reviewed or judged by a certain trial committee or trial organ. Some also have the leading organs review the cases first, put forward preliminary opinions, and then hand them over to the masses for discussion. For example, some places have adopted the method of cadres carrying case files to tour the countryside and streets for interrogation, mobilizing the masses to accuse, supplement and corroborate materials, absorb the masses to participate in the trial, and then the court makes a judgment. These are all effective ways to implement the mass line. In this way, the masses can not only provide many materials unknown to the People's Government about the counter-revolutionaries they are familiar with; but also after the masses have mastered the policies, they can also put forward correct sentencing opinions. "The people sit in the courtroom" and "the people act as judges" are truly unprecedented initiatives! This has won the praise of the broad masses of people and greatly improved the political enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, the process of clearing up backlog cases is also a process of continuing to deeply mobilize the masses to launch a fierce struggle against counter-revolutionaries. This valuable experience must be adopted in the future clearing up of backlog cases, so as to strive to complete this task within the stipulated time limit.
    Forcing counter-revolutionary criminals to work is one of the important means to eliminate the counter-revolutionary class, and it is also a basic policy to thoroughly transform criminals into new people. This transformation is a combination of political transformation and labor transformation, and a combination of punishment and education. To transform criminals into new people, it is necessary to eradicate their counter-revolutionary standpoints and views politically and ideologically on the one hand, and to train them to become skilled workers in production skills on the other hand. The people's governments and public security organs at all levels must attach sufficient importance to this work, which contains extremely important political and economic significance, and do it well.
    Third, in order to further eliminate counter-revolutionary activities, block the gaps in counter-revolutionary activities, disintegrate counter-revolutionaries, and strive to win over everyone who can be won over to the people's side, it is also necessary to do a good job in managing counter-revolutionaries, registering key members of reactionary parties and organizations, and educating the families of counter-revolutionaries. In addition, it is also necessary to establish security committees to consolidate and promote the enthusiasm of the masses in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, so as to facilitate the conduct of regular struggles to suppress counter-revolutionaries.
    In short, the nationwide suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, on the one hand, still has areas where it has not been carried out thoroughly, and there are situations where the five types of counter-revolutionaries have not been打击打击打击打击打击hit hard enough. We must continue to strengthen this work and carry out the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries thoroughly; on the other hand, after this period of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the People's Government and its public security organs, as well as the broad masses of people, have accumulated rich experience, and therefore it is entirely possible to carry out the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries thoroughly, ensure the thorough elimination of all counter-revolutionary remnants, and create more favorable conditions for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and developing the cause of national construction.

    伟大的镇压反革命运动
    罗瑞卿
    依靠毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导，年青的中华人民共和国根据镇压与宽大相结合的政策，在全国范围内展开了规模空前的镇压反革命运动。这一运动，以无比沉重的力量，予帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的残余势力以摧毁性的打击。现在，全国各地已逮捕了大量的匪首、惯匪、恶霸、特务、反动党团骨干分子中的坚决反革命分子和反动会道门头子。其中有大批血债甚多、对人民对祖国犯有极严重的罪行、非处决不足以平民愤的首恶分子，已被处死刑；有大批反革命分子已被判处徒刑，并正强迫他们进行劳动改造；另有一批尚在关押审讯中。至此，全国极大部分地区的镇压反革命运动，已经达到彻底，或者比较彻底的地步。这场胜利的斗争，不仅基本上摧毁了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国大陆上的残余反动势力，而且进一步发动与教育了广大人民群众，加强了人民民主专政制度，巩固了抗美援朝的后方，保障了国家建设的顺畅进行。
    事实证明，坚决镇压反革命的措施乃是中国人民实行人民民主专政、巩固与发展胜利必不可少的重要步骤。这是因为国民党匪帮的黑暗统治虽然已被推翻，但是他们遗留下来的反革命残余势力并未肃清。仅西南一个地区，在解放之初即有蒋介石匪帮留下来的特务八万人，土匪数十万人。此外反动党团骨干分子与国民党军、政官员中坚持反革命立场的分子，反动会道门头子以及恶霸分子等等，都有很大的数目。在其他新的解放地区，土匪虽较西南区为少，但其他反革命分子的情况，则是相似的。这些人乃是过去蒋介石匪帮进行反动统治的基础，中国人民在争取自由解放的斗争中，牺牲于他们的毒手者，是难以计算的。仅河南渑池一县，自抗日战争至解放前，死于反革命之手的革命干部和群众，即达七千余人。而在全国胜利以后，他们仍然到处散布谣言，破坏国家建设，甚至组织武装暴动，梦想颠覆人民政权。美蒋匪帮就是依靠他们作为内应，来进行复辟活动的。事实上，他们的破坏活动，已给予人民国家以极大的危害。例如潜伏在广西的反革命分子，在去年一年内，即曾组织规模大小不同的多次暴动，残杀革命干部和群众七千二百一十九人，烧毁房屋二万五千六百余间，抢劫耕牛二十余万头。榴江县板里村农民刘兆安，全家四辈五十一口人，被匪首刘甫全部杀光。对于这些十恶不赦的反革命分子，人民群众痛恨已极，齐呼之曰“小蒋介石”，纷纷要求人民政府采取坚定的方针，把他们彻底肃清，否则，人民的生命财产和国家建设就没有确切的保障，换句话说，巩固与发展革命的胜利成果也就成为不可思议的事情。
    根据广大人民群众的要求，各地人民政府迅速纠正了曾经一度存在的“宽大无边”偏向，采取了坚决镇压反革命的措施，特别自今年二月《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》颁布以后，在毛主席和中央人民政府领导之下，在各级人民政府、各级共产党委员会、各民主党派、各人民团体共同努力下，并经过各级人民公安机关及司法、检察各部门的努力工作，发动与组织了全国广大人民群众，展开了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动。从此反革命分子的嚣张气焰顿时下降，其内部则呈现一片混乱。大量反革命首要分子被逮捕、关押、处决，土匪、恶霸、特务、反动党团骨干分子和反动会道门这五种敌人，受到了极其严重的打击。许多反革命分子因走头无路，被迫向人民政府悔过自首，交出组织名单、证件、武器等等，低头认罪。成批成股的土匪投降瓦解或被歼。若干多匪省份如广西等省的土匪已基本肃清。少数死心塌地的反革命分子，则在人民巨掌中战栗失色，暂时不敢蠢动。蒋介石匪帮残余与战争贩子杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊之徒亦惶恐万状，哀鸣不已。全国各界人民则欢天喜地，拍手称快，人民政府的政声，誉满全国。
    在规模巨大的镇压反革命运动中，各界人民群众的政治认识发生了深刻变化，主人翁的感觉和爱国热情大大增强与提高，积极协助人民公安机关肃清反革命分子，这是大张旗鼓地进行宣传工作的直接结果。在运动过程中，各地从大中城市到小城市，以及广大农村，纷纷举行了各种代表会、干部会、座谈会、群众会，这些会议规模之大，影响之深，都是史无前例的。在这些会议上，举行了苦主控诉，展览了反革命罪证。此外，各地并利用广播大会、电影、幻灯、戏曲、报纸、小册子和传单，进行广泛的宣传工作。据北京市公安局统计，共召开各种群众会二万九千六百二十六次，参加群众累计达三百三十七万九千余人。天津市从三月到七月份，召开各种群众会二万一千四百次，参加人数累计二百二十万。上海组织了大小不同的展览会达八百余次，并印发了大量宣传品，仅《惩治反革命条例》即达二百四十万份，全市平均每两人即有一份。据河北省八个专区四个市的不完全统计，共召开审判控诉大会六百五十三次，参加群众三百九十万余人，共有三千六百九十三名苦主控诉了反革命罪犯的罪行。经过上述工作，全国广大群众受到了深刻的镇压反革命教育，中南全区受到这种教育的占总人口的百分之六十以上。福建全省受到教育的达总人口的百分之七十以上。南京市有百分之八十以上的市民受到了教育。因而广大群众的觉悟大大提高，群起协助人民政府镇压反革命。据统计，东北自镇压反革命以来至八月为止，共收到群众检举密告信十六万件。上海市收到检举信三万三千多件，检举反革命分子近二万九千人。在镇压反革命运动中，人民群众中涌现出大批积极分子，据天津市公安局统计，全市涌现各种积极分子一万二千四百六十八人，其中工人反奸模范共一百三十二人。河北省自备路费远地调查反革命分子的积极分子四百四十四名，拒绝贿赂，不怕牺牲的一千三百一十八名，帮助政府逮捕反革命分子的一千三百九十四名，积极进行宣传的八万八千零五十五名，其他各种积极分子一万三千五百八十六名。
    伟大的镇压反革命运动，加强了人民民主专政制度，巩固了抗美援朝运动的后方，在全国范围内完全确立了群众的优势，出现了历史上从未有过的全国范围的安定局面。东北绝大部分老解放区，从城市到乡村，股匪绝迹，社会秩序安宁。如哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔自镇压反革命以来，从未发生过盗匪案件。热河、辽东、辽西、吉林等省，去年土匪曾猖獗一时，抢劫破坏事件层出，今年土匪活动空前减少，只发现散匪三十余人，与去年比较，抢劫破坏事件，减少百分之九十五。因此农民称镇压反革命为真翻身，工人称之为第二个“八、一五”。在镇压反革命以前，河南扶沟县百分之八十的村子为恶霸地主所控制，现在全县所有村庄均树立起群众优势。福建连城县过去土匪、特务达二千五百余人，全县六个区均已遭土匪攻袭，县城被袭二次。现在股匪消灭，在清除了反革命分子之后，乡村政权已完全掌握在人民自己的手里。
    镇压反革命运动提高了群众的政治觉悟，巩固了人民民主专政，因而也创设了国家建设的有利条件。各工厂矿山职工把镇压反革命列为爱国公约的主要项目，纷纷自动组织“安全小组”“护厂队”，使破坏事故大大减少。例如河北唐山市启新洋灰厂等三个企业单位职工从三月份到六月份，共提出安全建议四百八十件，全市各厂矿与去年比较，减少事故百分之六十。镇压反革命以后，若干地方的觉悟程度还不高的农村群众彻底打破了“变天”思想，改变了“分田不敢要，分房不敢住，生产没心思”的状态，生产积极性空前高涨，他们普遍反应：“这回可牢靠了。”
    镇压反革命运动虽已获得伟大成绩，但是问题还没有完全解决，即反革命分子并未完全消灭。从地区上说，在一部分地区，镇压反革命的斗争进行得还不彻底，甚至有少数地区根本未动。这样的地区在各大行政区都有，特别是新区；至于尚未进行土地改革的地区，或者虽然已经进行了土地改革但并不彻底的地区，问题更加复杂。从对五种反革命分子的打击程度来说，也是不彻底的，特别在新区，在镇压反革命运动中，主要打击了土匪、恶霸。例如华东区处决的匪首、惯匪、恶霸，占了处决总数的百分之七十三点五。其他地区的情况也是相似的。对于特务分子、反动党团骨干分子中的坚决反革命分子，虽也给予了某种程度的打击，但一般还打击得不够；对反动会道门头子，也给了一定程度的打击，但是作为一个反革命组织的反动会道门，还没有将其彻底摧毁。再从发动群众方面来看，由于一部分地区的镇压反革命运动还没有进行得彻底，在这些地方，反革命分子的气焰依然嚣张，人民有仇未报，有冤未伸，依然不敢抬头。例如山西省有个别县份，三分之一的村庄还未进行镇压反革命运动，群众还怀疑政府是否为他们撑腰作主，还不敢起来进行斗争。即令在那些已经逮捕与处决了反革命分子的地方，也还有些县份因为没有进行大张旗鼓的宣传，发动群众积极参加镇压反革命运动，群众也还没有发动起来，甚至还有许多顾虑，例如怕外逃的反革命分子捉不回来，怕反革命分子报复等等。从上述三个方面看来，如何继续巩固与发展胜利，更彻底地打击敌人，更深入地开展镇压反革命的经常斗争，还是全国人民今后的严重任务。为了实现这一任务，必须：
    首先，在一切镇压反革命工作尚不彻底的地区，凡是应该捕必须捕而现在尚未捕的反革命分子，一律逮捕起来；并迅即依照《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》各项规定，加以法办，以满足群众要求。在进行此项工作时，既不能松懈麻痹，又不能夸大敌人力量。因此，一方面需要依靠高级领导机关的坚强领导，另一方面需要依靠专业机关严密的调查研究并进一步取得广大群众支持与协助，以便保证把土匪、恶霸、特务、坚决反对革命的反动党团骨干分子、反动会道门头子等五种反革命分子彻底肃清。至于一切应该缉拿的潜逃外地的反革命分子，则必须多方发动群众缉拿，务使归案法办。在清理积案中尚未判刑的反革命分子，只要确系罪大恶极，民愤极大，非处决不可的首恶分子，则应发动群众坚决处以死刑，丝毫不能犹豫。在进行上述一切工作时，必须与当时当地正在进行的抗美援朝、清匪反霸、减租退押、土地改革运动等密切结合起来，以收相互推动之效。
    其次是清理积案，对反革命分子进行劳动改造。现在，清理积案的工作已进行了四个月，并已取得许多宝贵经验，其中特别重要的是在清理积案中贯彻群众路线的经验。这就是将镇压反革命的全部政策，向群众讲解清楚，将群众所熟悉的反革命案件交给群众讨论，并可由群众提出量刑的初步意见，再由一定的审判委员会或审判机关审查或判决。也有的先由领导机关审查案件，提出初步意见，再交群众进行讨论。例如有些地方采取干部携带案卷到乡村、到街道巡回审讯，发动群众控诉，补充与对证材料，吸收群众参加审判，然后再由法庭判决，这些都是贯彻群众路线的有效办法。这样，群众不仅可以对他们熟悉的反革命分子，提供许多为人民政府所不知道的材料；而且群众在掌握政策之后，也能够提出正确的判刑意见。“人民坐大堂”，“人民当法官”，真是有史以来的创举！这已博得广大人民群众的称赞，大大提高了人民群众的政治积极性。所以清理积案的过程，也是继续深入发动群众向反革命分子展开激烈斗争的过程。这一宝贵的经验必须在今后的清理积案中加以采用。以便争取在规定的期限完成这一任务。
    强迫反革命罪犯劳动，是消灭反革命阶级的重要手段之一，也是彻底改造犯人成为新人的一项基本政策。这种改造，是政治改造与劳动改造的结合，是惩罚与教育的结合。要把罪犯改造成为新人，就要一方面在政治上、思想上铲除他们反革命的立场、观点，另一方面在生产技能上也锻炼他们成为熟练的劳动者。对于这项包含着极端重要的政治意义和经济意义的工作，各级人民政府及人民公安机关必须予以足够重视并把它作好。
    再次，为了进一步肃清反革命活动，堵塞反革命活动的空隙，瓦解反革命并争取一切可能争取的人到人民方面来，还必须作好对反革命分子的管制工作，作好反动党团骨干分子的登记工作以及对反革命分子家属的教育工作。此外，并须普遍建立治安保卫委员会，以便巩固与发扬群众镇压反革命的积极性，以利进行经常性的镇压反革命斗争。
    总之，全国的镇压反革命运动，一方面还有进行得不彻底的地区，对五种反革命分子还有打击不够的情况，还必须继续加强这一工作，把镇压反革命斗争进行彻底；另一方面，经过这一时期的镇压反革命运动，人民政府及其公安机关以及广大人民群众，已经积累了丰富的经验，因而完全可能把镇压反革命斗争进行彻底，保证彻底肃清一切反革命残余，为巩固人民民主专政，发展国家建设事业，创设更为有利的条件。
