    Seventeen Days and Nights of Resistance at Rooster Male Mountain
    People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Song Lanjun
    Returning to the motherland from the front lines of the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea to participate in the celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, I feel supremely honored and infinitely excited. I am a platoon leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This June, I led my unit to participate in the seventeen-day and night resistance battle at Rooster Male Mountain outside of Jinhua City. We defeated the enemy, who were superior in equipment and numbers, with a very small force.

    The seventeen-day and night resistance battle at Rooster Male Mountain began on June 12th. My mission was to lead a squad to guard the main peak of Rooster Male Mountain, the 603.9 height, and block the enemy advancing northward. On the 12th, the enemy began to attack our position with thirteen tanks and a platoon of soldiers. When the enemy advanced to about eighty meters, I ordered the whole squad to fire together. Within twenty minutes, we killed sixteen enemies, destroyed two enemy tanks, and captured two heavy machine guns. Later, the enemy attacked frantically again with a company of soldiers and twenty tanks, but were again repelled by us, and more than twenty enemies were killed.

    In the continuous battles day and night, we repelled several enemy attacks. Many American invading troops were wounded and killed by us. They were unwilling to give up, but they were afraid of death and dared not come up, so they transferred a battalion of Rhee's puppet army. At three o'clock in the morning on the 23rd, this battalion surrounded our squad in two directions. I immediately divided the whole squad into three groups to block the enemy. In order to eliminate more enemies, I ordered to open fire only after the enemy entered my effective range, thus repelling several enemy attacks in succession.

    On the 25th, I led twenty-one comrades, organized the firepower of grenades and automatic weapons, and counterattacked Rooster Male Mountain. The enemies on the top of the mountain were frightened by our sudden counterattack and fled down the mountain in panic, and were chased and killed by us for more than forty people. A lot of war trophies were seized. As a result, we only spent twenty-five minutes to take down the mountain top occupied by the enemy.

    In the seventeen-day and night resistance battle at Rooster Male Mountain, we gloriously completed the task of resistance at the cost of only a dozen casualties, and killed or wounded more than three hundred American and Rhee's bandit soldiers. (Attached photo)

    鸡雄山十七昼夜阻击战
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  宋兰君
    从抗美援朝的最前线回到祖国来参加庆祝建国二周年国庆典礼，我感到无上的光荣与无限的兴奋。我是中国人民志愿军某部的一个排长。今年六月，我带领部队参加了金化城外鸡雄山十七昼夜的阻击战。我们以极少数的兵力，战胜了在装备与数量上多于我们的敌人。
    鸡雄山十七昼夜阻击战在六月十二日开始。我的任务是带领一个班，守卫鸡雄山主峰六○三·九高地，阻击向北进犯的敌人。十二日，敌人开始以十三辆坦克和一排兵力向我们的阵地攻犯。在敌人进到八十公尺左右时，我就命令全班一齐开火。二十分钟内，打死了敌人十六名，击毁敌人坦克两辆，缴获两挺重机枪。后来敌人又以一个连的兵力，二十辆坦克，疯狂进攻，同样又被我们打退，并且击毙了敌人二十多名。
    在日日夜夜的不断的战斗中，我们又击退了敌人的几次进攻。美国侵略军被我们打伤打死的不少。他们不肯罢休，但自己又怕死不敢上来，于是，就调来了一个营的李伪军。二十三日早上三点钟，这个营分两路向我们班包围过来。我立刻把全班分成三个小组阻击敌人。为了要更多地消灭敌人，等敌人进入我有效射程以内，我才命令开火，这样就又接连打退了敌人的几次进攻。
    到了二十五日，我带领二十一个同志，组织好了手榴弹与自动武器的火力，向鸡雄山反击。山顶的敌人被我们的突然反攻，吓得仓皇逃窜下山，又被我们追着打死四十多个，缴获了不少战利品，结果我们只用二十五分钟的时间夺下了敌人占领的山头。
    鸡雄山十七昼夜阻击战中，我们仅以伤亡十余人的代价，先后毙伤美李匪军三百多名，光荣地完成了阻击的任务。（附图片）
