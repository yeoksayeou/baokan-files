    Cultural News Briefs
    ▲When the first Chinese documentary "The Birth of New China" was screened for the first time in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, in November last year, the audience reached more than 36,000 people. Many overseas Chinese residing abroad traveled from Sukabumi, a city more than 130 miles away from Jakarta, to watch it. Whenever Chairman Mao, the five-star red flag, and the People's Liberation Army appeared on the screen, the overseas Chinese expressed their love for the motherland with thunderous applause and cheers.
    Many overseas Chinese in Burma and Thailand took the initiative to resolutely refuse to watch the most reactionary films of American imperialism last year. In Indonesia, it is even more common for overseas Chinese to refuse to watch reactionary films of American imperialism. Some overseas Chinese also expressed their determination with signed letters. When the vicious propaganda film "Battle Hell in Korea," which insulted the Chinese and Korean people, was shipped to Jakarta for screening, it immediately aroused angry protests from the overseas Chinese, resulting in the reactionary film being unable to be screened in many cities in Indonesia.
    ▲Tsinghua University in Beijing has opened a Workers and Peasants' Fast-Track Middle School this semester. It is almost equivalent to a preparatory school for Tsinghua University, and most of the graduates will be promoted to Tsinghua University in the future. This is the beginning of Tsinghua University opening its doors to workers and peasants and systematically changing the composition of its students.

    ▲去年十一月，当新中国的第一部纪录片“新中国的诞生”在印尼首都雅加达首次放映时，观众达三万六千多人。很多居留海外的华侨，从远离雅城一百三十余英里的苏甲巫眉城赶来观看。当银幕上每次出现毛主席、五星国旗和人民解放军时，侨胞们都以如雷的掌声和欢呼声表示他们对祖国的热爱。
    缅甸、泰国的许多侨胞，去年自动地发起坚决拒看美帝国主义最反动的影片。在印尼，华侨拒看美帝国主义反动影片，更为普遍。有些侨胞还以签名书表示决心。当美国侮辱中朝人民的恶毒宣传片“血战全韩”运到雅加达准备放映时，立即引起侨胞们的愤怒的抗议，结果使这部反动影片在印尼的许多城市无法放映。
    ▲北京清华大学本学期开办了工农速成中学。它差不多等于清华大学的预备学校，将来绝大部分的毕业同学要升入清华大学。这是清华大学向工农开门，有计划地改变学生成份的开端。
