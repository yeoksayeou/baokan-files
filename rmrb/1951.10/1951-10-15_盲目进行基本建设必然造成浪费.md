Blindly Carrying Out Capital Construction Inevitably Leads to Waste
Fuel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central South Industry Department

In 1950, state-owned coal mines under the Central South Industry Department vigorously restored production and carried out some capital construction and drilling work. However, due to the short period since liberation, we did not conduct detailed investigations and research on the conditions of each mine. We blindly assumed that the mines operated by the former Resources Commission were all valuable. The original technical personnel formulated capital construction plans based on old viewpoints, and we did not review them in detail, blindly assuming they were all reliable. However, after the resumption of work at the Zhongxiang, Huxiang, and Yongshao mines, it was discovered that Zhongxiang and Huxiang had high pressure and large amounts of water; Yongshao had large amounts of water and poor coal quality. These mines had no operational value at the current stage. When work began on the Xiejiatang new shaft of the Xiangjiang Coal Mine, it was discovered that it had the same shortcomings as Zhongxiang and Huxiang, and it had to be stopped midway. As a result, 3.2 million catties of millet in national investment were wasted. This was the result of our blind leadership.

Before the People's Daily launched the discussion on capital construction issues, our leadership did not pay enough attention to capital construction ideologically. It was not until August of this year that the Fuel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central South Industry Department established a capital construction section. Prior to this, the bureau had not instructed the mines to establish capital construction organizations. Before seeing the Interim Measures for Capital Construction Procedures issued by the Central Financial and Economic Commission, our understanding of planning and design was very vague. We thought that as long as we submitted a plan, we could receive money from the central government; the money allocated by the central government would be transferred to the mines and that would be the end of it. We thought that capital construction did not require economic accounting; we did not inspect the progress of mine projects, nor did we strictly supervise the use of investment. Although there were comprehensive periodic statistical reports from the second half of 1950, which could show the use of investment, we still cannot summarize them on a monthly basis, often delaying the closing of accounts by two or three months. The bureau should be responsible for these shortcomings and errors.

In terms of material supply, our assistance to the mines was also insufficient. The 300 and 400 horsepower electric winches ordered by the Pingxiang Coal Mine have not been delivered for more than a year. The No. 12 steel wire (200 kg) ordered by the Yiluo Coal Mine took a long time to buy, but what they bought was No. 2, which was unusable. Sometimes the goods even arrived after the project was completed. Although we cannot control these situations ourselves, we have not paid enough attention to these issues.

The capital construction situation in 1950 was relatively chaotic. Capital construction plans were based on incomplete data. The design lacked thorough investigation and research, and there was no complete and sound management system and organization. Therefore, there was a lot of blindness and many shortcomings. Some projects started without a plan; some had no design drawings; some were found to be unsuitable after completion; and the use of funds was not concentrated enough. The phenomenon of waste was relatively serious. Having learned from the lessons of last year, this year's capital construction work has improved. The Pingxiang Coal Mine concentrated funds on a certain project, formulated plans and designs before construction, strengthened the management of capital construction projects, clearly distinguished production materials from capital construction materials, and stipulated procedures for receiving and returning materials, procedures for supplementing insufficient materials, and engineering acceptance methods. As a result, waste in capital construction in Pingxiang Coal Mine has been significantly reduced. The recorded waste in 1950 was 450 million yuan, while this year it has been reduced to over 24 million yuan by the end of May.

From the capital construction work of the past two years, we have learned the following lessons:

1.  Coalfields should not be developed blindly without detailed drilling records and detailed investigations and research. In addition to the aforementioned examples, the Wangjiayuan mine of the Pingxiang Coal Mine once excavated a slanting shaft at Magucao and Jianzicao each. When the project was completed or partially completed, it was discovered that it was not economically viable and had to be abandoned. These two slanting shafts wasted more than 287 million yuan in 1950 alone, and the expenses for 1951 have not yet been calculated.

2.  Funds should be used centrally and not evenly distributed. In the Central South region, funds should be concentrated on the Pingxiang and Yiluo mines, and the use of funds in the Pingxiang and Yiluo mines should also be concentrated on some more important projects. The past practice of distributing a little bit of funds to each mine in an egalitarian manner was wrong.

3.  Planning and design must proceed from reality, and construction must not be carried out blindly without planning and design. The Pingxiang Coal Mine started construction on a new project based solely on the power plant's requirements and a rough sketch. After completion, it was discovered that the area was too small to accommodate the transformer equipment and had to be rebuilt.

4.  Planning and design must have a scientific theoretical basis and must not be based solely on subjective wishes. The original plan for the water filter pool of the Quanjiang Power Plant was for a water storage capacity of 72 tons. It leaked water during use. After reconstruction, it was felt that the water volume was insufficient, so a larger pool had to be built, wasting 89 million yuan in labor and materials.

5.  The opinions of construction departments and the masses must be solicited during the design process. However, the construction department cannot arbitrarily modify the design. The Yiluo Coal Mine built many earthen-walled houses. Before the walls were dry, they were plastered with mud, resulting in cracks and peeling, causing rework and waste. If workers had been consulted beforehand, this waste could have been avoided.

6.  Being eager to achieve quick results can easily lead to waste. The Yiluo Coal Mine originally applied to install two generators. Before the higher authorities had approved it, it was eager to design iron frames for the two generators and started digging the foundation. As a result, only one was approved, so the iron frame had to be changed and designed as a wooden frame, and the excavated foundation was abandoned. The power plant of a certain mine hastily started construction on a water well without detailed investigation and research of the strata. As a result, the first well was forced to be abandoned due to the large amount of water; the second well was too close to the factory building. When digging down, it encountered a water-bearing sand layer, which collapsed greatly, affecting the factory building and the cold water area, and the well was filled.

In capital construction, there must also be a strict supervision system and acceptance system, and management agencies must be strengthened and various management systems established. This is also a necessary guarantee for reducing waste.

    盲目进行基本建设必然造成浪费
    中南工业部燃料工业管理局
    中南工业部所属各国营煤矿一九五零年大力恢复生产，并进行一部分基本建设与钻探工作。但由于解放时间短，我们对各矿情况没有进行详细的调查研究，盲目地以为伪资源委员会所经营的矿都是有价值的；原有的技术人员，均以旧观点拟订基本建设计划，我们也未加详细审核，盲目地以为都是可靠的。但在中湘、湖湘及永邵三矿复工后，即发现中湘、湖湘压力大，水大；永邵水大，煤质不好；这些矿在现阶段，均没有经营价值。湘江煤矿谢家塘新井开了工，又发现与中湘、湖湘有同样的缺点，只好中途停止。结果浪费国家投资三百二十万斤小米。这是我们领导盲目的结果。
    在人民日报展开有关基本建设问题的讨论以前，我们领导思想上对基本建设重视不够。直到今年八月，中南工业部燃料工业管理局才增设基本建设科。在此以前，局里也未指示各矿成立基本建设机构。在看到中央财政经济委员会所颁发的基本建设工作程序暂行办法以前，我们对计划与设计的认识是非常模糊的，以为报上了计划就可以向中央领钱；中央拨下来钱往矿里一转就算了事；我们以为基本建设用不着经济核算；对矿厂工程的进行不进行检查，对投资的使用也没有进行严格的监督。从一九五零年下半年开始，虽然有了综合定期统计报表，可以看出投资使用情况，但到现在还是不能按月总结，往往拖延两三个月才结出账来。这些缺点与错误是应该由局负责的。
    在材料供应方面，我们对矿厂的帮助也不够。萍乡煤矿所订购的三○○及四○○马力电绞车，时间已经一年多，尚没有结果。宜洛煤矿订购的十二号钢丝（二百公斤），很久才买好，但买的是二号的，不能用。有时甚至货到了工程已完工。这些情况虽然不是我们自己所能掌握的，但我们对这些问题是关心不够的。
    一九五零年的基本建设情况比较混乱。基本建设的计划都是从不完全的资料基础上做起来的。设计中又缺乏周密的调查研究，又没有完整的健全的管理制度和机构，因此盲目性很大，缺点很多。有的工程连计划都没有就开工；有的没有设计图样；有的完工后才发现不合用；资金的使用也不够集中。浪费现象是比较严重的。接受了去年的教训，今年的基本建设工作已有改进。萍乡煤矿将资金集中用在某项工程，做到了先制定计划与设计而后施工，加强了对基本建设工程的管理，将生产材料与基本建设材料划分清楚，并规定领退料办法、追补不足用料的手续和工程验收办法等。因此，萍乡煤矿在基本建设中的浪费已显著减少，一九五零年有记载的浪费为四亿五千多万元，而今年截至五月底止，浪费已减至二千四百多万元。
    从这两年的基本建设工作中，我们获得了以下的教训：
    一、没有详细的钻探记录，没有详细的调查研究，煤田不能盲目开发。除了前述例子外，萍乡煤矿的王家源矿厂曾开凿麻姑槽及枧子槽斜井各一口，待工程完成或完成一部时，才发现不合经济观点，只好弃置不用。这两个斜井仅一九五零年就浪费了二亿八千七百多万元，一九五一年的费用尚未计算在内。
    二、资金应该集中使用，不应平均分摊。以中南区来说，资金应集中萍乡、宜洛两矿，而萍乡、宜洛两矿使用资金也应集中在某些比较重要的工程上。过去平均主义地各矿分摊一点的办法是错误的。
    三、计划设计必须从实际出发，没有计划设计决不能盲目施工。萍乡煤矿新建某项工程，只凭电厂的要求与草图就施工，完工后发现面积太小，容纳不下变电设备，只好另作。
    四、计划设计必须有科学理论根据，绝对不能单纯从主观愿望出发。泉江电厂滤水池原计划容水量七十二吨，使用时漏水，重修后又感水量不足，只好再作一个大池，浪费工料八千九百多万元。
    五、设计时必须征询施工部门和群众的意见。但施工部门不能随便修改设计。宜洛煤矿盖了很多土壁房子，墙还没有干，就加皮刷粉，结果发生泥皮裂缝脱落现象，造成返工浪费。事前如能和工人商量，这种浪费是可以避免的。
    六、急于求成，容易造成浪费。宜洛煤矿原申请安装发电机两部。上级还未批准就急于安两部发电机设计铁房架并开始挖地基。结果只批准一部，只好把铁房架改变，设计为木房架，并放弃已挖的地基。某矿电厂开凿水井未经详细调查研究地层情况就急于施工，结果第一井因水大被迫放弃；第二井又距厂房太近，下挖时遇见含水沙层，崩塌很大，影响厂房及冷水地，又将此井填塞。
    在基本建设中，还必须有严格的监工制度和验收制度，并加强管理机构，建立各种管理制度。这也是减少浪费的必要保证。
