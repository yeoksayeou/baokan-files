Launch a Patriotic Production Increase Movement to Increase Yield Per Unit Area
Li Zheren, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

Increasing the yield per unit area is the basic content of developing the patriotic production increase movement and also the basic policy for developing agricultural production in the future. In the past two or three years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, relying on the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers after liberation, agricultural production in North China has been rapidly restored and developed.

This year, North China has created a new record for increasing yield per unit area.

In this year's patriotic production increase movement, North China's farmers have demonstrated even greater production enthusiasm, overcome serious disasters, and, with the exception of the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, have still been able to achieve more than 70% of a normal harvest year, and have created many new records for patriotic production increase. For example, the total value of agricultural production in Shanxi has exceeded the pre-war level by 16.2%, with grain yield per unit area exceeding pre-war levels by 2.3% and total output exceeding pre-war levels by 3.2%. Cotton achievements are even more significant, with yield per unit area exceeding pre-war levels by 53.8% and total output exceeding pre-war levels by 114.3%. What is particularly important is that in the past two years, many models for increasing yield per unit area have emerged in the North China region. In terms of increasing cotton production, Qu Yaoli from Jiexian, Shanxi, produced 745 jin of seed cotton per mu last year, and this year it is expected to increase to more than 830 jin, almost ten times the pre-war average yield per mu (90 jin). The mutual aid team he leads can increase seed cotton production by 287 jin per mu compared to last year. Liu Yongcai from Lixian, Hebei, and Guo Zongkong from Shahe also produced more than 700 jin of cotton per mu. In terms of grain production increase, national model worker Li Shunda produced 980 jin of Jin Huanghou corn per mu of mountain land; Hebei model worker Zhang Xishun produced 1,300 jin of millet per mu; Guo Yunxiang from Xushui, Hebei, produced 911 jin of millet per mu of dry land; Wang Xihe, a model worker in the plains, produced 900 jin of wheat per mu; Yang Jianshan from the plains planted spring millet in paddy fields and produced 800 jin per mu; Wei Lixin from Pingshun, Shanxi, planted “Hen's Mouth” millet, averaging 770 jin per mu of mountain land; Zou Yubin from Xiaozhan, Hebei, produced 1,100 jin of rice per mu; Ma Guorong from Changli, Hebei, produced 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu; and Dang Xingxian from Linhe, Suiyuan, produced 8,000 jin of potatoes per mu. The output of these model workers generally exceeds the average output by three to ten times; as for the skilled farmers whose yields exceed the average by one or two times, there are even more throughout the region; some mutual aid teams have created new records of bumper harvests for the entire team. These new records of bumper harvests are a great victory on our agricultural production front and are the creative labor results of the broad masses of farmers. They have provided us with valuable experience in increasing yield per unit area and have proven that the yield of cultivated land in North China can be greatly increased; they are guiding our agricultural production to move forward continuously.

The Basic Experience of the Patriotic Production Increase Movement in North China - Increasing Yield Per Unit Area
Why can North China carry out such a production increase movement and create new records for increasing yield per unit area?

First, land reform in North China has long been completed, and the productive forces and the production enthusiasm and wisdom of the farmers have been fundamentally liberated. In addition, in the past two years, we have consistently opposed utopian agricultural socialist ideas, and this year we have particularly strengthened the patriotic education of farmers, so the political consciousness and patriotic production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers have been further enhanced, and the conscious and creative labor attitude has been further strengthened. The slogan of increasing production and loving the country has become the active action of the broad masses of farmers. This production enthusiasm based on patriotism is the basic condition for carrying out the patriotic production increase movement and creating new records of bumper harvests.

Second, a region-wide patriotic production increase competition has been launched. This competition movement is led by Li Shunda, with rural Communist Party members and model workers in various places as the backbone, and mutual aid teams as the foundation. Individuals or mutual aid teams participating in the competition have formulated production increase plans and patriotic covenants. This competition movement closely combines the spirit of patriotism with the production requirements of farmers, so once it is launched, it quickly spreads throughout North China and affects the whole country. In Hebei Province, 300,000 agricultural mutual aid teams have signed patriotic production increase plans, and 10,000 agricultural model workers from 5,000 villages have launched production competitions with each other, of which 4,000 model workers have challenged Li Shunda. In Shanxi, 150,000 agricultural mutual aid teams have launched production competitions with each other, and 2,500 agricultural mutual aid teams have challenged Li Shunda. In Chahar, 11,000 model workers and 2,000 agricultural mutual aid teams have organized competitions with each other, and 140 agricultural mutual aid teams have challenged Li Shunda. In Suiyuan, more than 400 mutual aid teams have challenged Li Shunda (the figures for Pingyuan Province are missing). This production competition is a new movement of heroism in agricultural production, and it is the best way to systematically implement the national agricultural production policy, increase yield per unit area, and promote model workers and cultivate a large number of production activists.

Third, the policy of "organizing and developing production" has been implemented. The agricultural labor mutual aid movement in North China has a long history and great achievements, but due to the different levels of attention and the different working foundations in various places, the development of mutual aid teams is still not universal or balanced; the existing mutual aid teams also need to be consolidated. In order to strive to organize the majority of the main male and female labor force in North China in various types of mutual aid teams within two or three years, the Financial and Economic Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a research meeting on mutual aid teams this spring. At the meeting, the phenomenon of neglecting mutual aid teams was criticized, experiences were exchanged, and methods for further developing and consolidating mutual aid teams were studied. Therefore, mutual aid teams in North China have made great progress in drought-resistant sowing, weeding, pest control, and flood prevention. To date, the number of households organized in various types of mutual aid teams is about 50% of the total number of households, an increase of about 10% compared to this spring. Its forms can be divided into three categories: one is a temporary mutual aid team for labor exchange, which is the primary form of mutual aid team, the most numerous, and the easiest for the masses to accept, and should be widely developed and gradually improved; the second is a permanent fixed mutual aid team, which is combined with improved technology, development of sideline occupations, and development of supply and marketing, can increase output and increase the income of team members, and production is more planned. A small number of them have also accumulated a portion of jointly owned property and public accumulation funds according to the needs of the team members, which has greatly helped to overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds for the team members. This type of mutual aid team should be vigorously developed according to the principle of voluntary participation by the masses; the third is a land cooperative society with land and labor as shares, which is the most advanced form of mutual aid team and a transitional form from New Democratic agricultural production to socialist agricultural production. At present, the number is still small, and it should be developed in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner completely according to the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. No matter what form of mutual aid team, it is superior to individual farming. Because "organizing" facilitates the formulation of production plans, saves labor, purchases agricultural tools, increases fertilizers, improves technology, cultivates intensively and meticulously, repairs land, builds water conservancy projects, and overcomes disasters, and can solve the contradictions between various tasks during the busy agricultural season (such as spring construction and embankment restoration, spring farming production and disaster prevention, etc.). Therefore, developing mutual aid teams is the organizational guarantee for carrying out the patriotic production increase movement and increasing yield per unit area.

Fourth, a tenacious struggle was waged against various natural disasters. This year's disasters in North China were very serious, mainly drought, insects, and floods, followed by blight, hail, frost, and wind. Various places promptly launched mass struggles to overcome disasters, so the degree of disasters was greatly reduced. In order to overcome floods, the two provinces of Pingyuan and Hebei alone mobilized 1.2 million people to participate in dike construction, with a total of more than 50 million cubic meters of earthwork. In order to prevent drought, various places have universally launched a movement to repair canals and dig wells. This year, more than 52,000 brick wells have been dug, more than 67,000 waterwheels have been promoted, and more than 3,000 large canals have been repaired, expanding the irrigated area by more than 5 million mu. During the severe drought this spring, a large-scale drought-resistant sowing movement was launched throughout the region. In addition to basically completing the sowing plan for grain crops, the cotton planting task was greatly exceeded. In order to combat pests and diseases, in addition to universally launching the selection of seeds, soaking seeds, mixing seeds, autumn plowing, picking up grain stubble, and weeding, more than 90,000 sprayers and 8.6 million jin of various agents were supplied. After the occurrence of insect pests, more than 100 million people participated in aphid control, and Hebei Province alone had 7 million people participating in locust eradication. The state also sent aircraft to assist. It is estimated that no less than billions of jin of grain have been protected or increased due to the struggle against disasters. The experience of various places shows that overcoming pessimistic and disappointed emotions, carrying forward the idea that man will conquer nature, and mobilizing and organizing the broad masses to overcome disasters are important measures to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest.

Fifth, a movement to improve agricultural technology has been launched. This year, a total of 420,000 model workers, cadres, and activists in North China have received short-term agricultural technology training, becoming an important bridge for popularizing science and technology. Hebei Province alone has more than 6,600 technical research committees or technical groups, Shanxi has 300 mutual aid teams that have established small farms, and Chahar has 80% of farmers with seed retention land. Various places have universally promoted the methods of applying more fertilizer, skillfully applying fertilizer, applying fertilizer according to local conditions, planting crops according to local conditions, and applying fertilizer in a concentrated and phased manner. The whole region advocated the experience of selecting and promoting excellent varieties locally at the county, district, and village levels. According to rough statistics, the whole region has promoted 3.6 million jin of excellent grain varieties and 4.9 million jin of good cotton varieties. In the improvement of technology, the above-mentioned skilled farmers have special achievements. Their common characteristics are: paying attention to good varieties, timely sowing, intensive cultivation, applying more fertilizer, paying attention to fertilizer application technology, and paying attention to preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests and actively adopting new agricultural tools. They are no longer simple physical labor, but combine physical labor with the use of wisdom. They carry forward their inherent good production experience, eliminate superstitious and conservative aspects, learn scientific knowledge, and create new methods of increasing production, so their labor results are particularly great compared to others.

Promoting Advanced Experience and Striving for a Bumper Harvest Next Year

The above is the main experience in this year's patriotic production increase movement and the basic reason for being able to create new records of bumper harvests. In order to further carry out the patriotic production increase movement, increase yield per unit area, create more bumper harvest households, bumper harvest teams, and bumper harvest villages, and strive for a bumper harvest next year, the following work should be carried out from now on:

First, it is necessary to carefully and meticulously summarize the advanced agricultural bumper harvest experience and promote it in a planned manner. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has arranged to conduct a bumper harvest survey throughout the province, which is timely and necessary. The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry convened a cotton and wheat bumper harvest technology symposium with the participation of farm cadres, typical bumper harvest households, and agricultural science experts to summarize the cotton and wheat bumper harvest experience, which is also timely and correct. I propose that the five provinces of North China can comprehensively and systematically summarize the bumper harvest experience of 1951 before the end of this year in order to obtain several effective methods for increasing production, and through bumper harvest meetings, exhibitions, model worker meetings, newspapers, periodicals, blackboards, winter schools, night schools, New Year pictures, etc., vigorously publicize and implement them to guide next year's bumper harvest movement. Staff engaged in agricultural scientific research should actively conduct research and promotion in conjunction with the current bumper harvest experience of the broad masses.

Second, it is necessary to widely carry out evaluation and comparison movements, convene model worker meetings, and establish bumper harvest banners. Model workers who have achieved success in increasing yield per unit area should be given considerable material and honorary rewards in order to further stimulate the enthusiasm of farmers to improve technology and increase production. In the evaluation and comparison movement, the focus should be on universally conducting the evaluation of farming technology and good varieties, so that the broad masses of farmers understand that to increase yield per unit area, it is not only necessary to hoe more, plow more, and apply more manure, but also to pay attention to technology and carry forward wisdom.

Third, develop and consolidate mutual aid teams. Only by "organizing" can things that individuals cannot do be done. For example, improving farming technology, buying new agricultural tools, buying pest control machinery, opening canals, digging wells, improving soil, developing sideline occupations, etc., are very difficult or even impossible for individual farmers to do, but they are very easy for mutual aid teams to do, and mutual aid teams have enriched their production content by doing these things, increasing the income of team members from all aspects. In this way, team members will cherish the mutual aid teams more, and the mutual aid teams will be further consolidated and attract individual farmers who have not joined the mutual aid teams to gradually approach the mutual aid teams. With the development of mutual aid teams, the organizational form of mutual aid teams should be gradually improved according to the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, so that it is more conducive to the development of agricultural production.

Fourth, supplement old agricultural tools in a planned manner. At the same time, it is necessary to focus on promoting new agricultural tools suitable for local farmers, such as new plows, corn threshers, choppers, waterwheels, sprayers, water-drawing machines, etc. These are effective tools for improving labor productivity and increasing yield per unit area. In addition, it is necessary to solve the problem of fine fertilizer. To this end, it is necessary to advocate the restoration of old oil presses in order to expand the output of soybean cake and achieve the effect of local supply. State-owned trade agencies and supply and marketing cooperatives should actively find sales channels for oils and fats and vigorously supply farmers with the agricultural tools, fertilizers, and machinery they need to promote the improvement and development of agricultural production.

Fifth, grasp autumn plowing, winter plowing, and do a good job in production self-rescue in disaster areas. This is the most urgent work at present. In addition, we should also launch a movement to pick up stubble, weed, burn stubble, and burn grass. In areas with many insects, we must also dig up insect eggs and prepare for opening canals, digging wells, and pest control machinery in order to lay a good foundation for increasing agricultural production and preventing insects and drought next year.

Sixth, it is necessary to revise the patriotic covenant in a timely manner and strengthen the patriotic education of farmers in order to further promote the patriotic production increase movement.

    开展爱国丰产运动，提高单位面积产量
    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会副主任  李哲人
    提高单位面积产量，是发展爱国丰产运动的基本内容，也是今后发展农业生产的基本方针。近两三年来，在共产党、人民政府领导下，依靠解放后广大农民的生产积极性，华北农业生产已有迅速地恢复与发展。
    今年华北区创造了提高单位面积产量的新纪录
    在今年爱国主义丰产运动中，华北农民发挥了更高的生产积极性，战胜了严重的灾害，除了察哈尔和绥远两省外，其他三省仍能争取到七成以上的年景，并创造出许多爱国丰产的新纪录。例如，山西农业生产总值已超过战前水平百分之十六点二，其中粮食单位面积产量超过战前百分之二点三，总产量超过百分之三点二；棉花成绩更显著，单位面积产量超过战前百分之五十三点八，总产量超过战前百分之一百一十四点三。特别值得重视的是：近两年中，华北区涌现出不少提高单位面积产量的模范。在增产棉花方面，山西解县曲耀离，去年每亩产籽棉七百四十五斤，今年可增至八百三十多斤，几达战前每亩平均产量（九十斤）的十倍。他领导的互助组，每亩可比去年增产籽棉二百八十七斤。河北蠡县刘永才、沙河郭宗孔，每亩棉花也产到七百多斤。在粮食增产方面，全国劳动模范李顺达，每亩山地产金皇后玉茭九百八十斤；河北劳动模范张希舜，每亩产谷子一千三百斤；河北徐水郭云祥，每亩旱地产谷子九百一十一斤；平原劳动模范王希河，每亩产小麦九百斤；平原杨见善在水地中种春谷，每亩产八百斤；山西平顺魏理新种母鸡嘴谷子，平均山地每亩产七百七十斤；河北小站邹玉彬，每亩产水稻一千一百斤；河北昌黎马国荣，每亩产甘薯一万斤；绥远临河党行先，每亩产马铃薯八千斤。这些劳动模范的生产量，一般均超过平均产量三倍到十倍；至于超过平均产量一两倍的丰产能手，全区就更多了；有些互助组，全组创造了丰产新纪录。这些丰产新纪录，是我们农业生产战线上的伟大胜利，是广大农民创造性的劳动成果。它们给我们提出了提高单位面积产量的宝贵经验，并证明了华北的耕地产量是可以大大提高的；它们在引导着我们的农业生产不断地向前迈进。
    华北区爱国丰产运动——提高单位面积产量的基本经验华北区为什么能开展这样的丰产运动，并能创造出提高单位面积产量的新纪录呢？
    第一、华北区土地改革早已完成，农村生产力和农民的生产热情与智慧，都从根本上得到了解放，加以近两年来坚持地反对了空想的农业社会主义思想，并在今年特别加强了农民的爱国主义教育，因而广大农民的政治觉悟和爱国生产热情更加提高，自觉地创造性地劳动态度更加加强，增产爱国的口号已变成广大农民的积极行动。这种建立在爱国主义基础上的生产积极性，是开展爱国丰产运动和创造丰产新纪录的基本条件。
    第二、开展了全区性的爱国丰产竞赛。这一竞赛运动以李顺达为首，以各地农村共产党员和劳动模范为骨干，以互助组为基础；参加竞赛的个人或互助组，都制定了丰产计划和爱国公约。这一竞赛运动，把爱国主义精神与农民的生产要求密切结合起来，故一经发动，便很快普及到华北各地，并波及全国。河北省有三十万个农业互助组订立了爱国丰产计划，有五千个村的一万个农业劳动模范相互开展了生产竞赛，其中有四千个劳动模范向李顺达应战。山西有十五万个农业互助组相互开展了生产竞赛，有二千五百个农业互助组向李顺达应战。察哈尔有一万一千个劳动模范、二千个农业互助组相互组织了竞赛，一百四十个农业互助组向李顺达应战。绥远有四百多个互助组向李顺达应战（缺平原省数字）。这种生产竞赛是农业生产上的新英雄主义运动，是有计划地贯彻国家农业生产政策，提高单位面积产量，提高劳动模范和大量培养生产积极分子的最好方式。
    第三、贯彻了“组织起来，发展生产”的方针。华北区的农业劳动互助运动是有长久历史并有很大成绩的，但因各地重视程度不一和工作基础不同，因而互助组的发展仍然是不普遍、不平衡的；已有的互助组也需要加以巩固。为了争取在两三年内将华北区男女主要劳动力大部组织起来，中共中央华北局财经工作委员会曾于今春召开了互助组研究会议，在会议上，批评了忽视互助组的现象，交流了经验，研究了进一步发展与巩固互助组的办法。因此，华北区互助组在抗旱播种、锄苗、除虫、防汛中，又有了很大的发展。迄今组织在各种类型互助组中的户数，约达总户数百分之五十左右，比今春增加了约百分之十。其形式可分三类：一为临时劳力拨换工的互助组，这是互助组的初级形式，为数最多，群众最易接受，应普遍发展，逐步提高；二为常年固定的互助组，这种互助组与改良技术、发展副业、发展供销等相结合，能够更多地提高产量和增加组员收入，且生产比较有计划性。其中少数并根据组员需要，积累了一部分伙有财产和公积金，对克服组员资金不足的困难有很大作用。对这类互助组，应根据群众自愿的原则大力发展；三是土地劳力入股的土地合作社，这是互助组中最高级的形式，也是由新民主主义农业生产到社会主义农业生产的一种过渡形式，目前为数尚少，应完全根据群众自愿原则，有计划、有步骤、有重点地去发展。不论何种形式的互助组，均比单干优越。因为“组织起来”，便于订定生产计划、节省劳力、购置农具、增加肥料、改良技术、精耕细作、修整土地、兴修水利和战胜灾害，并能解决农忙季节各种工作（如春工复堤、春耕生产与防治灾害等）间的矛盾。因此，发展互助组是开展爱国丰产运动和提高单位面积产量的组织保证。
    第四、和各种自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争。今年华北区的灾害是很严重的，主要是旱、虫、水三灾，疸、雹、冻、霜、风等灾次之。各地及时地开展了群众性的战胜灾害斗争，故灾害程度大为减轻。为了战胜水灾，仅平原、河北两省就动员了一百二十万人参加修堤，共作土方五千多万公方。为了防旱，各地普遍开展了修渠、打井运动，今年共打砖井五万二千余眼，推广水车六万七千余辆，修整大渠三千余道，共扩大浇地面积五百余万亩。在今春亢旱时，全区掀起了大规模地抗旱播种运动，除基本上完成了粮食作物的播种计划外，并大大地超过了植棉任务。为了战胜病虫害，除普遍发动选种、浸种、拌种、秋耕、拾谷茬、锄杂草外，并供应了喷雾器九万余架，各种药剂八百六十余万斤。在虫害发生后，有一亿个以上人工参加除蚜，仅河北一省即有七百万人参加剿蝗，国家并派飞机协助。估计因和灾害作斗争而保护了或增产了的粮食，不下数十亿斤。各地经验说明，克服悲观失望情绪，发扬人定胜天的思想，动员组织广大群众，战胜灾害，是争取农业丰产的重要措施。
    第五、开展了改良农业技术运动。今年全华北共有四十二万个劳动模范、干部、积极分子受过短期的农业技术训练，成为普及科学技术的重要桥梁。仅河北一省就有六千六百多个技术研究委员会或技术小组，山西有三百个互助组建立了小型农场，察哈尔有百分之八十的农户有留种地。各地普遍推广了多上肥，巧施肥，因地施肥，因地种植作物和集中分期施肥的方法。全区提倡了县、区、村三级就地评选、就地推广优良品种的经验，据概略统计，全区共推广粮食优种三百六十万斤，棉花良种四百九十万斤。在改良技术中，上述丰产能手更有特殊的成就。他们的共同特点是：重视良种、适时播种、精耕细作、多施肥、讲究施肥技术，并注意防治病虫害和积极采用新式农具。他们已不是简单的体力劳动，而是把体力劳动与运用智慧结合起来，他们发扬固有的好的生产经验，淘汰迷信的保守的方面，学习科学知识，并创造了新的增产办法，因而他们的劳动成果比别人格外大。推广先进经验，争取明年丰收
    以上就是今年爱国丰产运动中的主要经验，也是能够创造出丰产新纪录的基本原因。为了进一步开展爱国丰产运动，提高单位面积产量，创造更多的丰产新纪录，出现更多的丰产户、丰产组和丰产村，并争取明年丰收，从目前起应即进行以下工作：
    第一、必须认真地细致地总结先进的农业丰产经验，并有计划地加以推广。山西省农林厅已布置在全省范围内进行一次丰产调查，这是适时的，必要的。河北省农林厅召开了有农场干部、丰产典型户和农业科学专家参加的棉、麦丰产技术座谈会，总结棉麦丰产经验，这也是适时的、正确的。我提议华北五省都能在今年年底以前，将一九五一年的丰产经验全面地系统地加以总结，以便得出几条增产的有效办法，经过丰产会议、展览会、劳动模范会、报纸、刊物、黑板报、冬学、夜校、年画等方式，大力宣传，贯彻下去，以指导明年的丰产运动。从事农业科学研究的工作人员，更应结合当前广大群众的丰产经验，积极进行研究和推广。
    第二、必须广泛地开展评比运动，召开劳动模范会议，树立丰产旗帜。对于提高单位面积产量有成绩的劳动模范，应予以相当的物质奖励和名誉奖励，以便更进一步地激发农民提高技术增加生产的积极性。在评比运动中，中心应是普遍进行耕作技术和良种的评比，使广大农民了解要提高单位面积产量，不但要多锄、多犁、多上粪，而且要讲求技术，发扬智慧。
    第三、发展与巩固互助组。只有“组织起来”，才能举办个人所不能举办的事情。例如，改良耕作技术、伙买新式农具、伙买除虫药械、开渠、打井、改良土壤、发展副业等，由个体农民去办都很困难，甚或不可能，但由互助组举办，便很容易，而且互助组因举办了这些事情，就更加充实了它的生产内容，从各方面增加组员收入。这样，就会使组员对互助组更加爱护，使互助组便会进一步巩固起来，并吸引没有参加互助组的单干户逐渐向互助组靠拢。随着互助组的发展，在群众自愿的原则下逐步提高互助组组织形式，使之更有利于农业生产的发展。
    第四、有计划地补充旧农具，同时，必须有重点地推广适合当地农民使用的新式农具，如新式步犁、玉米脱粒机、铡草机、水车、喷雾器、汲水机等。这是提高劳动生产效率和提高单位面积产量有效的工具。此外，还须解决细肥问题；为此，就要提倡恢复旧有的榨油厂，以便扩大豆饼的产量，并能收到就地供应之效。国营贸易机关和供销合作社应积极地为油脂找销路；并大力供应农民所需要的农具、肥料、药械等，以促进农业生产的改进和发展。
    第五、抓紧秋耕、冬耕和做好灾区生产自救，这是当前最迫切的工作。此外，还应开展拾茬、除草、烧茬、烧草运动，虫多的地方并要挖虫卵，作好开渠、打井和除虫药械的准备，以便为明年农业增产和防虫、防旱打下良好的基础。
    第六、必须及时地修订爱国公约，加强对农民的爱国主义教育，以便进一步推动爱国丰产运动。
