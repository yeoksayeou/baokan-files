    Striving to Implement the New Education System
    To the Editors:
    We express our firm support for the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on reforming the education system, published in the People's Daily on October 3rd.

    Our new education system is no longer a product reflecting the old politics and old economy of colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal China, but a product reflecting the new politics and new economy of New Democratic China. It is superior to the education systems of old China and capitalist countries. Its basic characteristic lies in opening the doors of schools to the workers, peasants, and laboring people and their children. The new education system reforms into a two-level six-year primary school, adopting a consistent teaching method and shortening the time by one year, so that the children of all laboring people in urban and rural areas can enjoy the opportunity of complete primary education. It also establishes the status of various forms of cadre, technical, and remedial schools.

    We, the students of the normal schools, are the future participants in the cultural construction of the motherland, and also the executors of the new education system. Undoubtedly, the new education system increases our responsibilities. We will definitely join hands closely with cultural and educational workers across the country, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government, strive to complete this glorious task!

    为实现新学制而努力编辑同志：
    我们对于十月三日人民日报所登载的中央人民政府政务院关于改革学制的决定，表示坚决的拥护。
    我们的新学制不再是反映殖民地半殖民地半封建中国的旧政治、旧经济的产物，而是反映新民主主义的中国新政治、新经济的产物。它是更优越于旧中国和资本主义国家的学制。它的基本特点在于学校向工农劳动人民及其子女开门。新学制改革分为两级的六年小学，而采用一贯制的教学，并缩短一年时间，使城市和乡村一切劳动人民子女能享受完全的初等教育的机会。它同时确定了各种形式的干部、技术和补习学校的地位。
    我们师范学校的同学，就是将来祖国文化建设的参加者，同时也是新学制的执行者。无疑地，新学制加重了我们的责任。我们一定和全国文化教育工作者紧密地携起手来，在中央人民政府的领导下，为完成这一光荣任务而奋斗！
    北京师范大学  李金营  彭琼熙等二十一人
