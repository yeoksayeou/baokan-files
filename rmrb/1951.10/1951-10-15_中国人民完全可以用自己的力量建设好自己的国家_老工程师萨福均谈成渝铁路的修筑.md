The Chinese People Can Absolutely Build Their Own Country Well with Their Own Strength
——Veteran Engineer Sa Fujun Discusses the Construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway

Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Zongtang

The brave and hardworking Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, can absolutely build their own country well with their own strength. This is the conclusion that veteran engineer Sa Fujun has reached in the year since the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

Sa Fujun is the son of Sa Zhenbing, a veteran of the Chinese Navy. He is sixty-seven years old this year and has been engaged in railway engineering construction in China for forty years. He is currently the Deputy Director of the Communications Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and concurrently the Deputy Director of the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau. On the eve of National Day, he excitedly told reporters: "Thirty-eight years ago, I participated in the survey work of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway (then known as the Sichuan-Hankou Railway), but only today do I dare to say that it can definitely be built and it will definitely be built well." He said that he had never been so happy in forty years. He said, "When I initially accepted the task of constructing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, I was very worried. At that time, there were no steel rails, no sleepers, not even workers, tools, or engineering technicians. However, who knew that with a call from the People's Government, from the highest-level government to the lowest-level government, everyone mobilized together, and hundreds of thousands of migrant workers immediately gathered on the line. In the past, the Kuomintang couldn't even grab them, but now they are competing to come and are unwilling to go back after working. In one area of eastern Sichuan, four thousand migrant workers voluntarily requested to stay on the railway forever as workers. More than 1.2 million sleepers were also continuously transported from the mountainous areas more than a hundred miles away on both sides of the railway line to the railway line. The steel rail factory started work, and the rolling mill, which the Kuomintang considered a pile of scrap iron, was put into operation, producing thousands of steel rails and laying them on the line. All bridge engineering teams, renovation teams, and track laying teams were quickly established. What is even more touching is the concern of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government for us, mobilizing support from all over the country. All of these are things I never dared to imagine in the past. In just over a year, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has already opened to traffic for more than 200 kilometers. This is the fastest railway ever built since there were railways in the country; the quality of all kinds of engineering is also above the prescribed standards." He said, "This is the first time in my life that I have seen a railway built by the Chinese people with their own hands and with their own materials."

He said: "Migrant workers who couldn't even read in the past are now able to create and invent many valuable things in their work. For example, Xie Jiaquan, a farmer from Yongchuan County, eastern Sichuan, continuously created six methods of drilling blasting holes and improved four types of drill bits after participating in road construction work. The 'bamboo cannon' method he created reduced the amount of explosives used per cubic meter of stone from eight ounces to three and a half ounces. His method was promoted throughout the entire line, saving the country more than 5 billion yuan in explosives." According to him, technical personnel have also undergone major changes. Lan Tian, an old engineer in his sixties or seventies, was very negative about life before liberation and was known as "Buddha." After liberation, Mr. Lan was extremely happy when he heard about the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. He ran on the line every day with his crutches. During the route survey, he came up with a good idea that shortened the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway by 24 kilometers.

He said that Soviet experts have given us many valuable suggestions, such as ramming the roadbed fill, drilling sleeper holes, and steel rail base plates. Good results have been achieved in the past six months. Their internationalist spirit of helping the Chinese people in construction is fundamentally different from the so-called railway "advisors" sent by those imperialist countries in the past. Those guys were nothing more than imperialist commodity salesmen. They wanted us to order everything from abroad, from a track spike on the railway to even the bricks and tiles used for the ticket office at the station.

Mr. Sa finally said: "In the past year or so, I have learned many new things and seen and heard many new things in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. And the biggest gain among them is that I have deeply experienced the greatness of the power of the people of the motherland." When the Southwest Railway Bureau enthusiastically launched a donation campaign in August, he donated 47 million yuan of his past savings. At the bureau's donation campaign conference, he said with tears in his eyes: "I have lived for so long, and today I finally see the motherland becoming prosperous day by day." He also expressed his willingness to contribute all his strength to the construction of the motherland.

    中国人民完全可以用自己的力量建设好自己的国家
    ——老工程师萨福均谈成渝铁路的修筑
    新华社记者  刘宗棠
    勇敢而勤劳的中国人民，在共产党领导下完全可以用自己的力量建设好自己的国家。——这是老工程师萨福均在修建成渝铁路一年多来所得的结论。
    萨福均是我国海军宿将萨镇冰的儿子，今年六十七岁，在我国从事铁路工程建设已四十年。他现在是西南军政委员会交通部副部长，兼任西南铁路工程局副局长。国庆节前夕，他对记者兴奋地说：“三十八年前我就参加了成渝铁路（当时称川汉路）的勘测工作，但是只有在今天我才敢说它一定能够修成，而且一定修得很好。”他说他四十年来从没有像今天这样愉快过。他说：“我最初接受修筑成渝铁路的任务时很担心，那时既无钢轨，又无枕木，甚至没有工人，没有工具，没有工程技术人员。但是，谁知道人民政府一声号召，从最高级的政府到最下级的政府一齐动员，几十万民工马上集合到路线上来。过去国民党抓都抓不来，现在他们是争着来，干了还不肯回去。川东一个地区就有四千多民工自动要求永远留在铁路上作工人。一百二十多万根枕木也从铁路两侧百里以外的山区源源运到铁路线上。钢轨厂开工了，被国民党认为是一堆废铁的轧钢机开动起来，制出了成千上万根铁轨铺到路线上。所有桥工队、装修队、铺轨队全都很快成立起来。更使人感动的是毛主席和中央人民政府对我们的关怀，发动全国各地支援我们。这些都是我过去想都想不到的。只有一年多的时间，成渝铁路已经通车二百多公里。全国有铁路以来这是修筑得最快的一条；各样工程质量也都在规定标准以上。”他说：“这是我有生以来第一次看到的中国人民以自己的双手，用自己的材料建筑起来的铁路。”
    他说：“过去连字都不识的民工，现在竟能在工作中创造和发明了许多很有价值的东西。如川东永川县一个农民谢家全，参加筑路工作后，连续创造了六种打炮眼的方法，改良了四种炮钎。他创造的‘竹儿炮’方法，使每方石头由用炸药八两减少到三两半。他的方法在全线推广，给国家节省五十多亿元的炸药。”据他说，技术人员也有了大的转变。六七十岁的老工程师蓝田，解放前对人生很消极，被人称为“佛爷”。解放后，蓝先生一听说修成渝铁路高兴极了，每天拄着拐杖在路线上跑，在勘测路线时因为他想出了好办法，使成渝路缩短了二十四公里的工程。
    他说，苏联专家给我们提出了许多宝贵的建议，如像路基填土打夯、枕木钻眼、钢轨垫板等，半年来都已收到很好的效果。他们帮助中国人民建设的国际主义精神与过去那些帝国主义国家派来的所谓铁路“顾问”有本质的不同。那些家伙不过是帝国主义的商品推销员。铁路上一个道钉，甚至连车站票房用的砖瓦，他们都要我们向外国订货。
    萨先生最后说：“一年多来，在成渝铁路的修建中，我学会许多新东西，看到听到许多新事物。而其中最大的收获是我深深体验到祖国人民力量的伟大。”八月份西南铁路局热烈展开捐献运动时，他将自己过去积蓄的四千七百万元捐了出来。在该局捐献运动大会上，他含着眼泪激动地说：“我活了这么大年纪，今天才看见祖国一天天富强起来。”他并表示为了祖国的建设，愿贡献出自己的全部力量。
