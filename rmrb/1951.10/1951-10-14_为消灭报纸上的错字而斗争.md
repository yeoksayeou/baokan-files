    Struggle to Eliminate Errors in Newspapers
    Press and Publication Department, Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Gao Zijun
    To realize the slogan of "Striving for newspapers without errors," we must at least achieve: eliminating errors in newspapers, especially eliminating political errors caused by misprints. Therefore, newspaper staff must change the erroneous views of "errors are inevitable" or treating errors as a "technical problem," and truly establish an ideological style of being responsible to the people for every single word.
    In order to correct the bad phenomenon of constant errors appearing in various newspapers in East China, the News and Publication Bureau of the East China Military and Political Committee issued a notice to all newspapers on September 18th last year to conduct an inspection, find the causes of the errors, and formulate improvement measures. Since then, articles such as "Resolutely Eliminate Errors in Newspapers," "Struggle for Further and Thorough Elimination of Errors in Newspapers," and "The Masses Daily's Review Report on Errors and Textual Defects in Newspapers" have been published successively in the 6th, 10th, and 16th issues of "News and Publication." At the same time, readers also constantly criticize the newspapers. Under the urging of all parties, some newspaper editorial departments (such as Shandong Masses Daily, Nanjing Xinhua Daily, Zhejiang Daily, and six other newspapers) have attached importance to this issue and established an inspection system. Therefore, the number of errors in newspapers has decreased compared to the past year. This is progress.
    However, many newspaper editorial departments, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of eliminating errors, or still adopting a nonchalant attitude, or making the prescribed inspection system a mere formality, still constantly produce errors in some newspapers, even causing political errors due to misprints.
    For example, in the reports on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, on April 12, page 5 of Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, in the article "Resolutely Fight Against Counter-Revolutionary Elements," "in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries" was wrongly written as "in the counter-revolutionary work." On April 10, page 4 of Liberation Daily, in the article "Jiugui Middle School Formulates Specific Plans to Carry Out Counter-Revolutionary Suppression Education," "assisting the government in conducting counter-revolutionary suppression propaganda to relatives and friends" was wrongly written as "assisting the government in conducting counter-revolutionary propaganda to relatives and friends." On May 23, page 3 of Shandong Masses Daily, in the article "Criticism of Two Manifestations of Peace Paralysis Thought," "at least lacking sufficient awareness of actively participating in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries" was wrongly written as "at least lacking sufficient awareness of actively participating in the counter-revolutionary struggle."
    Similar serious errors have also occurred in reports on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. For example, on April 16, page 4 of Zhejiang Daily, in the article "How to Carry Out the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in Rural Areas," "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea" was wrongly written as "Aid U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea."
    In policy propaganda, when the Zhejiang Daily General Editor's Office reviewed the news "Initially Established a Correct Learning Attitude" of the Zhejiang Branch of the East China People's Revolutionary University, it changed "the policy of benefit to both labor and capital is not to reconcile class relations, but to develop production" to "the policy of benefit to both labor and capital is not to develop production" (quoted from the first item of "Policy Principles Errors" in the article "Newspaper Inspection" in the second issue of "Zhejiang Daily Communication"). This completely distorted the policy of the People's Government. These errors are clearly political errors.
    In addition, there are also cases where the original meaning is completely distorted due to a wrong word or a punctuation mark. For example, in the reader's letter column of Sub-Northern Jiangsu Daily on May 27, in the letter "Wu Yuan Yi Completely Has Freedom of Love, Why Did the Township Head Tie Him Up," a few words were originally "...I am a youth because recently..." but the editor mistakenly saw the word "因" (yin, because) as the word "团" (tuan, league), and subjectively added a "员" (yuan, member) under the word "团," resulting in the reader being mistakenly identified as a "Youth League member." Another example is in the report "More Than a Thousand Workers from More Than Ten Factories Including Hangshi Huaxin and Weicheng Held a Meeting, Bitterly Accusing Counter-Revolutionary Crimes" on page 3 of Zhejiang Daily on May 17, the comma "," in the sentence "Speaking of special agent Zhou Fangyi, Xu Fumei's hatred is even deeper" was wrongly punctuated as a semicolon ";". Because of this mistake, the accuser Xu Fumei was also mistakenly identified as a special agent. This completely distorted the facts.
    The above errors are intolerable. The continuous occurrence of such errors in the people's newspapers greatly damages the dignity of the people's newspapers and sometimes objectively provides free publicity for the enemy.
    The editorial departments of these newspapers are not completely unaware of the seriousness of these errors; many newspapers have made multiple "corrections" or reviews; but the problem now is: why do these errors occur again and again? According to the inspection reports of various newspapers in East China, there are the following reasons:
    First of all, some newspaper editorial staff have not truly realized that every word and every sentence in the newspaper has an impact on the thoughts and actions of millions of people; therefore, they have not fully established an ideological style of being serious and responsible to the people, causing this error to occur again and again. Anhui Northern Anhui Masses Daily once reviewed in the article "How to Eliminate Errors in Newspapers": "The law of Anhui Northern Anhui Masses Daily's errors is: a major error occurs at a certain time, so everyone thinks the problem is serious, holds meetings for review, conducts criticism, and formulates improvement measures, and the spirit is invigorated. In a very short period of time, there are fewer errors (but small errors continue); after a few days, they gradually become paralyzed again, small errors continue as before, and major errors are committed again; then meetings are held again, reviewed again, and the cycle continues." This is one type. Another type is that some people mistakenly believe: "Every newspaper has tens of thousands of words, and it has to go through so many people's hands in the work process, it is inevitable to have a few errors." Some people also say: "What's the big deal if a newspaper has a few errors, it still guides the work the same way, what's the big deal!" This shows that these comrades regard the newspaper, which is a weapon of ideological struggle, as an insignificant thing, and even made false propaganda to the masses, and still think it is irrelevant and not worth "making a fuss about." May I ask, is it not strange to make false propaganda to the masses, then what is strange?
    Secondly, it is due to the ideological laziness and subjectivism of editors and reporters. For example, some editors, sometimes due to not respecting the facts, not respecting the original meaning of the author, making arbitrary deletions and revisions, often make it inconsistent with the original facts, or completely unrecognizable. In addition, errors also occur because the original manuscript is scribbled, making it difficult for typesetting workers and proofreaders to identify.
    Third, some newspapers neglect proofreading work. For example, Shanghai Xinmin Evening News once said in the review report on the issue of errors that they had a basic error in the past, which was neglecting proofreading work and regarding proofreading work as purely boring technical work, so proofreading staff were also not at ease with their own business. Another example is that in the previous period, there was only one person who specialized in proofreading work in Nanjing People's Daily, and two people who held concurrent positions. Imagine how difficult it is to avoid errors with so few people and having to complete tasks on time.
    Based on the above situation, the editorial departments of some newspapers still have quite serious liberalism and a bad careless style.
    In order to effectively launch an irreconcilable struggle against these ideological styles that are harmful to the people's news work and eliminate errors in newspapers, it is necessary to strengthen the political education of all staff and strengthen their sense of responsibility for the people's cause. And constantly study and improve working methods. Specifically: when reporters write manuscripts, the words should be written clearly, and do not write those "flamboyant" "talented words." When editors revise manuscripts, they must not change the facts, and the names of people and places, times, and the course of events in the manuscripts must be corrected without error before sending them out. All original manuscripts that are so heavily revised that they are difficult to identify should be transcribed clearly, otherwise, the reviewers should not review them; the typesetting room also has the right to protest typesetting such manuscripts in order to prevent errors caused by this. Proofreading work is an important link to ensure that newspapers do not make errors, so it is a political work and must be done well. At the same time, when proofreading, proofreading staff should not lightly let go of any doubtful words, sentences, or punctuation marks, and should promptly raise them and study them with the editors until they are confirmed to be correct. The view that proofreading work is purely technical work is wrong.
    To ensure the implementation of the above system, it is also necessary to strictly implement the reward and punishment system. For political errors caused by misprints, responsibility must be investigated, and those who make mistakes should be given due punishment to educate everyone. Those who have consistently been serious and responsible in their work and have no errors should be commended and rewarded to set an example for everyone to learn from. In short, only when everyone in the entire work process of the newspaper can establish a correct work attitude and develop a work style of being responsible to the country and the people for every word, every sentence, and even every punctuation mark, can errors in newspapers be completely eliminated. Requiring newspaper staff to fight together to eliminate errors in newspapers.

    为消灭报纸上的错字而斗争
    中共中央华东局宣传部报刊出版处  高子君
    我们要实现“为没有错误的报纸而奋斗”这一口号，起码要做到：消灭报纸上的错字，特别是消灭因错字而造成的政治性错误。因此，报纸工作人员，必须改变“错字难免”，或把错字看成“技术问题”的错误观点，切实树立一字一句都对人民负责的思想作风。
    华东军政委员会新闻出版局为纠正华东各报不断出现错字的不良现象，曾于去年九月十八日通知各报进行一次检查，找出错误原因，订出改进办法。此后，又接连在“新闻与出版”第六期、第十期、第十六期发表了“坚决消灭报纸上的错字”、“为进一步彻底消灭报纸上的错字而斗争”、“大众日报关于报纸中的错误和文字缺点的检讨报告”等文章。同时，读者也不断向各报提出批评。在各方面督促之下，有些报纸（如山东大众日报、南京新华日报、浙江日报等六家报纸）编辑部已重视了这一问题，并建立了检查制，因此，一年来，报纸上的错字已较前减少。这是进步的方面。
    但还有不少报纸编辑部，由于对消灭错字的重要性认识不足，或者依然采取满不在乎的态度，或者使已规定的检查制度流于形式，以致有些报纸仍不断出现错字，甚至由错字而造成政治性的错误。
    例如，在镇压反革命的报道中，四月十二日上海大公报五版，在“坚决和反革命分子作斗争”一文中，将“在镇压反革命工作中”错成“在反革命工作中”。四月十日解放日报四版在“缉椝中学订出具体计划进行镇压反革命教育”一文中，将“协助政府对亲友进行镇压反革命宣传”错成“协助政府对亲友进行反革命的宣传”。五月二十三日山东大众日报在三版“太平麻痹思想两种表现的批判”文中，将“至少缺乏积极参加镇压反革命斗争的充分自觉”错成“至少是缺乏积极参加反革命斗争的充分自觉”。
    在抗美援朝的报道中，也同样发生过这种严重的错误。如四月十六日浙江日报四版“怎样在农村中开展抗美援朝运动”文内，把“抗美援朝”错成“援美援朝”。
    在政策宣传上，浙江日报总编办公室在审阅华东人民革命大学浙江分校“初步树立了正确学习态度”新闻时，把“劳资两利政策，不是为了调和阶级关系，而是为了发展生产”改为“劳资两利政策，不是为了发展生产”（引自“浙江日报通讯”第二期“报纸检查”一文第一项“政策原则性错误”举例）。这就完全歪曲了人民政府的政策。这些错误显然是政治性的错误。
    此外，还有因为搞错一个字或一个标点而完全歪曲了原意的。如五月二十七日苏北日报读者来信栏所刊登的“吴元益完全有恋爱自由，乡长为什么要绑他”的来信中，有几个字原是“……我是一个青年因最近……”，编者却将“因”字错看为“团”字，并主观地在“团”字下面添了一个“员”字，结果将该读者错成为“青年团员”。又如浙江日报五月十七日三版“杭市华新、纬成等十余厂千余工人开会，悲愤控诉反革命罪行”的报道中，把“说到特务周芳怡，徐福美的仇恨更深”句中的“，”点，错成“、”点。因这一“点”之错，结果把控诉者徐福美也错成为特务了。这就完全歪曲了事实。
    上述这些错误是令人不能容忍的。在人民的报纸上，不断地出现这种错误，大大损害了人民报纸的尊严，并且在客观上有时候为敌人作了义务宣传。
    对于这些错误的严重性，各该报编辑部也并不是完全不了解；有不少报纸已作过多次“更正”或检讨；但现在的问题是：为什么这种错误竟一犯再犯呢？根据华东各报的检查报告来看，有以下几个原因：
    首先是有些报纸编辑部工作人员，还没有真正认识报纸上的每字每句都对千百万群众的思想行动有着影响；因而，没有完全树立对人民严肃负责的思想作风，使这种错误一犯再犯。皖北大众报在“怎样消灭报纸上的错误”一文中，曾这样检讨说：“皖北大众报犯错误的规律是：某一个时候出一个大错，于是大家认为问题严重了，开会检讨，进行批评，订出改进办法，精神为之一振。在很短的时间内，错误比较少一些（但仍然是小错不断）；几天过去，又渐渐麻痹起来，照旧是小错不断，大错又犯；于是再开会、再检讨，就这样循环下去。”这是一种类型。另一种类型是，有一部分人错误地认为：“每张报纸有几万字，在工作过程中又要经过那么多人的手，错几个字是难免的。”还有人说：“一期报纸错几个字，还不是一样指导工作，有什么了不起的，还值得大惊小怪！”这就说明，这些同志，把作为思想斗争武器的报纸，竟视为无足轻重的东西，甚至向群众作了错误的宣传，还认为无关紧要，不值得“大惊小怪”。试问，向群众作了错误的宣传还不奇怪，那么什么才奇怪呢？
    其次，是由于编辑、记者思想上的懒惰和主观主义。如有些编辑人员，有时因不尊重事实，不尊重作者原意，大笔一挥，任意删改，也常常弄得与原事实不符，或者面貌全非。另外因原稿字迹潦草，使排字工人、校对人员难以辨认而发生错误的也有。
    第三、有些报纸忽视校对工作，如上海新民晚报在关于错字问题的检讨报告中，即曾说过去他们有一个基本错误，是忽视校对工作，视校对工作为单纯的枯燥的技术工作，因而校对工作人员也不安心于本身业务。又如南京人报在前一个时期专做校对工作者仅有一人，兼职者二人。试想人手这样少，又要按时完成任务，这就很难避免发生错误了。
    根据上述情形看来，若干报纸编辑部还存在着相当严重的自由主义和恶劣的粗枝大叶作风。
    为有效地和这些有害于人民新闻工作的思想作风展开不调和的斗争，消灭报纸上的错字，必须加强全体工作人员的政治教育，加强他们对人民事业的责任感。并经常研究改进工作的方法。具体地说：记者写稿时，字要写清楚，不要写那些“龙飞凤舞”的“才子字”。编辑改稿时，一定不能改错事实，对稿内人名、地名、时间、事情经过等须校正无误，然后再发稿。凡是原稿涂改得难于辨认的，应誊写清楚，否则，审稿人就应不作审查；排字房亦有权抗议排此种稿件，以杜绝因此而发生的错误。校对工作是保证报纸不出错误的一个重要环节，因此它是政治性的工作，必须把它作好。同时，校对工作人员在校稿时遇有怀疑的字、句、点，都不要轻轻放过，应及时提出来和编者研究，直到证实无误为止。那种以为校对工作完全是技术工作的看法，是不对的。
    要保证上述制度的贯彻执行，还必须严格执行奖惩制度，对因错字而造成的政治性错误，必须追究责任，对犯错误的给予应得的处分，以教育大家。对工作一贯认真负责而无错者，应给予表扬与奖励，以树立大家学习的榜样。总之，只有使报纸全部工作过程中的每一个人，都能树立起正确的工作态度，养成一字、一句以至一个标点都对国家、对人民负责的工作作风，才能彻底消灭报纸上的错字。要求报纸工作人员共同为消灭报纸上的错字而斗争。
