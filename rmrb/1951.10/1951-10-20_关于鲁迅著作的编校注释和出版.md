On the Editing, Proofreading, Annotation, and Publication of Lu Xun's Works
      Feng Xuefeng
    I. Overview of the Original Editing and Publication of Lu Xun's Works

    Most of Lu Xun's writings and translations during his lifetime were published in single volumes, all of which he personally compiled. The works and translations that were not published during his lifetime were edited and published in the following categories:

    1.  Those he had personally compiled and were published after his death include "Qiejieting Miscellany" and its second collection, "Mountain People's Pastoral Songs," "Guxiaoshuo Gouchen," and "Ji Kang Ji."

    2.  Those he had personally compiled in part and were compiled and published by Ms. Xu Guangping after his death include "Qiejieting Miscellany: Final Compilation" and "Collection Outside the Collection: Gleanings."

    3.  Those he had personally compiled but have not yet been published include "Xie Cheng's Annotated Edition of the Book of Later Han," "Liu Xun's Lingbiao Luyi," "Han Dynasty Portraits," and "Rubbings of Han Dynasty Steles."

    4.  Except for "Letters Between Two Places," his letters were not published during his lifetime, nor were they collected during his lifetime. After his death, Ms. Xu Guangping collected them and published a portion in photographic form in 1937, and a thick volume was published in 1946. Collection is still ongoing.

    5.  Diaries, which he himself did not intend to publish during his lifetime, have only been published by us in photographic form this year.

    6.  Fragmentary writings that were omitted from the collections were also collected by Ms. Xu Guangping in "Translations Supplement." After the publication of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun" in 1938, Mr. Tang Tao also collected "Supplements to the Complete Works of Lu Xun." The posthumous writings are still being collected.

    The above is a general overview. For more detailed information, please refer to the "Bibliography of Lu Xun's Translations" attached to "Three Idlers Collection" and the "Bibliography of Lu Xun's Translations: Continued" compiled by Xu Guangping and her "Postscript to the Editing and Proofreading of the Complete Works of Lu Xun" attached to Volume 20 of the 1938 edition of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun."

    As for the publication of his Complete Works and Thirty Year Collection in 1938, I will discuss them in another section below.

  II. Publication of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun" and "Thirty Year Collection" in 1938

    In 1938, under the main responsibility of Ms. Xu Guangping, Comrade Hu Yuzhi, and others for editing and publication, and with the assistance of Shanghai cultural circles and patriotic individuals, the twenty-volume "Complete Works of Lu Xun" was edited and published, which is the only complete collection we have now.

    In addition to including all of Lu Xun's major writings and translations, this complete collection also includes several of his early translations and a collection of his compiled works. Those that were not printed during his lifetime, except for those that have not been printed to this day, have all been included in this complete collection; at the same time, most of the posthumous writings have also been included.

    Therefore, although this complete collection is far from perfect, it has already made the first compilation of Lu Xun's writings and translations. It has completed an extremely important and necessary step in the project of preserving and disseminating Lu Xun's posthumous works.

    Only because it was compiled hastily under extremely difficult conditions at the time, it was impossible to include all letters, diaries, and unprinted works, nor was it possible to avoid errors in editing and proofreading; this was limited by the conditions at the time and awaits a second compilation, re-editing, and re-proofing.

    Regarding the process of editing and publishing this complete collection and the people who participated in the work, please refer to Ms. Xu Guangping's "Postscript to Editing and Proofreading" attached to Volume 20 of this complete collection, which I will not elaborate on here.

    The "Thirty Year Collection" includes all the works in this complete collection except for translations, that is, all the works in the first ten volumes of this complete collection. It was published at the same time as the complete collection.

    This complete collection was printed four times in Shanghai and once in the Northeast. According to Ms. Xu Guangping's recollection, it was printed a total of about 9,500 copies. The number of copies printed of the "Thirty Year Collection" was roughly the same. These were all printed before the national liberation in 1949. Since the national liberation, it has not been reprinted. As for the sales volume of all kinds of single volumes from Lu Xun's earliest publications to the present, it is impossible to know now because there have never been any statistics.

    The above two paragraphs are a very brief description of the editing and publication of his works from Lu Xun's death to the national liberation.

  III. Proposal for Reorganization

    Lu Xun's writings and translations were openly banned and secretly obstructed from circulation by the reactionary government during his lifetime; after his death, the reactionary government still banned and hated them, and the situation did not change at all. Therefore, distribution was greatly hindered in the past. Although Ms. Xu Guangping tried her best to reprint the complete collection and the Thirty Year Collection in the years before the national liberation, she could not make Lu Xun's works widely circulated in China due to numerous difficulties.

    On the other hand, speculators and bad elements arbitrarily stole and chaotically compiled and selected his writings and translations, which not only infringed on the author's copyright, but also made numerous errors, damaged the content of the works, and greatly harmed readers. This situation was the same during Lu Xun's lifetime, and it has only increased after his death. Therefore, the versions of his works circulating in China are also very chaotic.

    In view of the above two situations, and because the complete collection compiled in 1938 was not yet perfect, and the people's demand for Lu Xun's works has begun to increase after the national liberation, it is necessary to reorganize them for mass republication.

    In October last year (1950), the responsible parties discussed and decided on several measures, two of which are:

    1.  The General Administration of Publications, represented by Ms. Xu Guangping, will gradually recover the copyright of Lu Xun's single volumes from various private bookstores and prohibit arbitrary reprinting and compilation.

    2.  An editorial department for Lu Xun's works will be organized to re-edit, proofread, and annotate all of Lu Xun's works. This editorial department was established in Shanghai in November and is called the "Lu Xun Works Publishing House," which is under the leadership of the General Administration of Publications; after the establishment of the People's Literature Publishing House, it was transferred to the People's Literature Publishing House as a special editorial department of the publishing house. In addition to myself, Wang Shijing, Sun Yong, Yang Jiyun, and Lin Chen are also working there.

    We formulated a work plan in November last year, which was published in the "Literary Gazette" in February this year, and will not be repeated here.

  IV. Progress of Current Work

    We officially started working in December last year. In the past ten months, we have done the following:

    1.  More than two-thirds of the published writings and translations have been initially proofread once with reference to various versions (and the publications and newspapers in which the works were originally published, if available).

    2.  We have collected some materials useful for annotation and have begun to interview people and places related to Lu Xun's life.

    3.  We have solicited a small number of letters that had not been solicited before, and will continue to solicit them in the future.

    4.  Annotation work has begun to be attempted, and initial drafts have been made for six or seven kinds.

    5.  We have published "Lu Xun's Diary" in photographic form, compiled two kinds of materials useful for studying Lu Xun, and collected and sorted out some materials useful for writing a new Lu Xun's chronicle and biography, and the statistical work of Lu Xun's vocabulary has also begun.

    The above is a simple overview of our work. But we feel that our biggest gain in the past ten months is that we have honestly understood the difficulty of this work. Therefore, we have to learn while working, that is, we must spend a lot of time reading Marxist-Leninist books, especially carefully reading Chairman Mao's works, learning Marxism-Leninism and its scientific methods; studying Chinese history - especially the history of the last hundred years and the revolutionary history of the last thirty years, etc.; secondly, modern world literary thought and Chinese classical literature knowledge, etc., and the content of Lu Xun's thoughts and writings must also be repeatedly and deeply penetrated. Only by studying in this way can we carry out our work. Also, the materials needed for annotation are very difficult to collect, which is also a major difficulty in our work. Because of these two points, we very much hope that everyone will give us guidance and help.

    We originally planned to complete all the editing, proofreading, and annotation work in 1952, but it seems that the time will probably have to be extended given the current situation.

    In terms of publication, we hope to publish two or three annotated single volumes in 1952. As for the selected works and the most complete complete collection, they can only be decided after all the annotation and editing work is completed, but we hope that they can all be published in 1954.

    The single volumes that the People's Literature Publishing House is publishing successively are temporarily reprinted based on the single volume paper plates of the previous Lu Xun Complete Works Publishing House and correcting the typos that have been proofread, and are not newly typeset. They will all be reprinted in new typesetting when the annotated single volumes are published next year.

    关于鲁迅著作的编校注释和出版
      冯雪峰
    一、鲁迅著作原来编辑出版上的概况
    鲁迅先生一生著译，大部分都在他生前已经以单行本出版了，并且都是由他亲手编定的。其未及在他生前出版的著译，在编辑和出版上有如下几类情形：
    一、他已经亲手编定而在逝世后出版的，有“且介亭杂文”及其二集、“山民牧唱”、“古小说钩沈”、“嵇康集”等。
    二、他亲手编定了一部分而在逝世后由许广平先生编成出版的，有“且介亭杂文末编”及“集外集拾遗”等。
    三、已经由他亲手编定而至今尚未出版的，有“谢承后汉书辑本”、“刘恂岭表录异”、“汉画像”、“汉碑贴”等。
    四、书信除“两地书”外，都未在生前出版，且未曾在生前搜集。在逝世后，曾经由许广平先生搜集，在一九三七年影印出版过一部分，又在一九四六年出版过一厚册。现在仍在继续搜集中。
    五、日记，在生前他本人并没有出版的意思，到今年始由我们影印出版。
    六、遗漏未编集的片断文字，在逝世后还有许广平先生搜辑的“译丛补”。在一九三八年“鲁迅全集”出版后，唐韬先生又搜辑有“鲁迅全集补遗”。遗文现在也还在继续搜集中。
    以上是说一个大概情形。要知比较详细的情形，请看“三闲集”所附的“鲁迅译著书目”及一九三八年版的“鲁迅全集”第二十卷所附许广平所编的“鲁迅译著书目续编”和她的“鲁迅全集编校后记”。
    至于一九三八年出版了他的全集和三十年集，我在后面另段叙述。
  二、一九三八年“鲁迅全集”及“三十年集”的出版
    一九三八年由许广平先生、胡愈之同志等为编辑与出版的主要负责人，在上海文化界和爱国人士的援助之下，曾经编辑出版了二十大卷的“鲁迅全集”，这也就是我们现在已经有的唯一的全集。
    这全集除鲁迅先生全部主要著译都已经包括在内以外，还收集了他早年的几种译品和一种辑集。其未在生前印出的，除了到现在也尚未印出的以外，都已经收印在这全集中；同时大部分的遗文也都已经收录。
    所以，这全集虽然离完善的地步还很远，但已经把鲁迅先生的著译做了第一次的整理。在保全和流传鲁迅先生遗著的工程上已经完成了极重要的必须做的一步工作。
    只因为当时是在极困难的条件之下仓卒编成，既不可能把书信、日记等以及未印的著作都编入无遗，也不可能没有编辑校对上的错误；这是当时条件所限制，有待于第二次的整理和重编重校的。
    关于这全集的编辑出版的经过以及参加工作的人士，请看这全集第二十卷所附的许广平先生的“编校后记”，这里不多叙了。
    “三十年集”，包括的就是这全集所收的除了翻译之外的全部著作，也就是这全集的前十卷所收的全部作品。出版也和全集同时。
    这全集，在上海共印过四次，东北翻印过一次，据许广平先生凭记忆的统计是一共印了九千五百部上下。“三十年集”的印数约略相同。这都在一九四九年全国解放以前印的，全国解放以后就没有再印了。至于从鲁迅先生生前最早出书一直到现在的所有各种单行本的销行数量，因为向来没有统计，现在就无从知道了。
    以上两段是鲁迅先生逝世后到全国解放时之间关于他的著作的编辑出版情况的一点极简略的叙述。
  三、重新整理的提起
    鲁迅先生的著译，在他生前就受着反动政府的公开禁止和暗中阻挠其流行的；在他逝世后，反动政府仍然禁止和仇视它，情形并未有一点改变。因此，发行上在以前是受了很大的阻碍的。许广平先生在全国解放前几年中虽竭力进行全集和三十年集的重印工作，但也因为困难重重，不能使鲁迅先生著作在国内广泛流行。
    另一方面，投机商人和恶劣分子又随意偷印与胡乱编选他的著译，不仅侵害作者的版权，尤其错讹百出，损害作品的内容，遗害读者很大。这情形，是在鲁迅先生生前就如此的，而在他逝世后更是有增无已。因此，他的作品在国内流行的版本也是很混乱的。
    鉴于以上的两种情况，又因为一九三八年编的全集尚未完善，而全国解放后人民对于鲁迅先生的著作的要求也已经开始在提高，所以就有重新整理，以便大量重新出版的必要了。
    去年（一九五○）十月间，由负责方面商量决定了几个办法，其中有两点是：
    一、由出版总署代表许广平先生逐步向各私营书店收回鲁迅著作部分单行本的版权，并禁止随便翻印和编选。
    二、组织一个鲁迅著作的编辑部，以重新编校和注释鲁迅先生的全部著作。这个编辑部十一月间在上海成立，称为“鲁迅著作编刊社”，归出版总署领导；人民文学出版社成立后又划并给人民文学出版社，作为该出版社的一个专门编辑部，现在参加工作的除我以外还有王士菁、孙用、杨霁云、林辰等四人。
    我们在去年十一月曾经定过一个工作方案，今年二月间曾在《文艺报》发表过，兹不赘述。
  四、现在工作的进行情况
    我们正式工作是从去年十二月开始的，在这十个月中间，我们已经做了如下几件事：
    一、已出版的著译，已经有三分之二以上参照各种版本（及能够找到的最初发表作品的刊物与报纸）初校订了一次。
    二、已经搜集了一些对注释有用的材料，并开始访问和鲁迅先生生平有关的人与地。
    三、已经征求到了少数以前尚未征得的书信等，以后仍继续征求。
    四、注释工作已经开始尝试，现在有六七种已经做了最初的初稿。
    五、影印出版了“鲁迅日记”，编辑了两种对研究鲁迅有用的资料，并搜集和整理了对新写鲁迅年谱和传记有用的一部分材料，而鲁迅语汇的统计工作也已经开始。
    以上是我们工作的简单情况。但我们觉得在这十个月来我们最大的一个收获，是老老实实地懂得了这工作的艰难。因此，我们不得不一边学习一边工作，就是必须分出很多时间来看马列主义的书，尤其要精读毛主席的著作，学习马列主义及其科学方法；研究中国历史——尤其近百年史和近三十年革命史等；其次是近代世界文艺思想和中国古文学知识等，而鲁迅的思想和著作内容也须反复深入的渗透。只有这样一边学习，才能一边进行工作。还有，注释所需要的材料也都非常不容易搜集的，这也是我们工作上的一个大困难。由于这两点，我们很希望大家给我们指教和帮助。
    我们原定在一九五二年完成全部编校注释工作的，看现在情形时间上恐怕不能不延长。
    在出版方面，我们希望在一九五二年内能出版两三种注释单行本。至于选集和最完整的全集，则须在全部注释和编校工作完成后才能决定，但我们希望都能在一九五四年内出版。
    现在人民文学出版社陆续出版的单行本，是暂时根据以前鲁迅全集出版社的单行本纸版重印而改正了已经校出的错字的，并非新排。到明年注释单行本出版时将一律重新排印。
