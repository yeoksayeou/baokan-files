The Cotton Pavilion at the North China Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition points out a beautiful prospect for China's cotton production to the audience.

China is an agricultural country, but during the Kuomintang rule, our country could not be self-sufficient in cotton and grain. In 1946, the Kuomintang government imported cotton from foreign countries, accounting for more than 75% of the domestic cotton production. This situation quickly changed after the Chinese people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The chart showing the increase and decrease of cotton planting area in North China in the Cotton Pavilion illustrates: If the cotton planting area in 1947 is taken as 100, then it is 417 in 1951; if 1936 is taken as 100, then it is 183 in 1951. Looking at the national cotton output, taking the average of the five years before the War of Resistance Against Japan as 100, it reached 111 in 1950, exceeding it by 11%. This year it will exceed even more. Our textile industry raw materials are already close to being self-sufficient.

The continuous progress of cotton production in our country is reflected in many aspects. The expansion of improved cotton varieties is the most significant fact. The chart in the Cotton Pavilion illustrates this situation: If the area of improved cotton varieties in 1949 is taken as 100, it surged to 800 in 1950, and even more to 3700 in 1951. The area of improved cotton varieties expanded in Shanxi Province this year is more than eight times the expansion last year.

In order to expand the cotton planting area and increase cotton production, the People's Government has used great efforts to reward and support cotton farmers. The thorough implementation of the grain-cotton price ratio and the policy of superior quality with superior price have given farmers a definite guarantee of income from cotton planting. The chart tells people: In the era of the Kuomintang and Japanese invaders, there was a situation in 1938 where one jin of cotton could be exchanged for nine jin of millet, but in most years, the cotton price ratio was very low. In 1940, one jin of cotton could only be exchanged for a little over five jin of millet. Qu Yaoli planted eight mu of cotton in 1943, harvested 300 jin of lint cotton, and only exchanged it for 480 jin of sorghum. At that time, cotton farmers would starve even in bumper years. After the People's Government stipulated the grain-cotton price ratio, this phenomenon no longer occurred. In addition, the supply of high-quality cotton seeds, the supply of fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, and new farm implements, and the implementation of policies such as loans and insurance have all promoted the expansion of cotton fields and increased cotton production.

The high-yield achievements of cotton planting experts such as Qu Yaoli have given the audience a particularly deep impression. A large number of male and female farmers representatives crowded in front of the fertile cotton plants planted by these experts, listening to the narrators explain their methods of increasing production. The cotton planted by Qu Yaoli reached 745 jin of seed cotton per mu last year, and it is estimated that it can reach 836 jin this year (not yet harvested). The cotton of Liang Jiarui and Zhang Junqi, farmers in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, is estimated to produce 600 jin per mu. Zhou Shun, a cotton farmer in Linqing, also produced 470 jin per mu of cotton planted in dry land. The records created by these models allow people to see the vast possibilities of increasing the yield per unit area. The average yield of cotton per mu in North China is now 91.8 jin. If the yield per mu can be increased to one-quarter of Qu Yaoli's cotton yield, that is, about 200 jin, the cotton production in the entire North China will more than double. The great relationship between this and the country's industrial construction and people's lives is conceivable.

The feudal land system, natural conditions, disasters, and unscientific old experiences had bound farmers for thousands of years. Under the leadership of the Party, the farmers of North China overthrew the feudal land system and began to fight against nature. The soil of Qu Yaoli's cotton field is not good, but he implemented many excellent methods to change these natural conditions. For example, using moisture-preserving methods to prevent drought; immediately tilling the land after picking cotton every year, insisting on plowing twice, harrowing twice, rolling four times, and raking twice; applying more than 9,000 jin of fertilizer in one mu of cotton field; cutting small cracks at the roots of cotton seedlings to prevent cotton seedlings from "growing wildly"; implementing field selection, and mixing seeds with hot water and human urine, etc. These methods enabled him to obtain amazing harvests. Xue Ziliang from Pingyuan Province planted cotton in alkaline land and harvested 400 jin of seed cotton per mu. Cotton seedlings are prone to death when planted in alkaline land. He created methods of digging pits to replace soil and piling soil to preserve moisture, and finally overcame the limitations of natural conditions. He Yuchun of Tongxian Prefecture in Hebei created a method of raising seedlings on sunny slopes and then transplanting them, overcoming the spring cold's attack on cotton seedlings. When Lu Yanshang of Pingyuan Province planted cotton in wheat stubble land, he implemented scalding seeds with boiling water (seedlings can emerge in two days) and applied top dressing early, resulting in a harvest of 480 jin of wheat per mu and 200 jin of seed cotton in autumn.

Promoting these valuable experiences of high-yield models and striving to improve the yield per unit area, then the cotton production of our country will be limitless. (Lin Zhang) (Attached picture)

    我国棉花生产量是不可限量的
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会棉花馆介绍
    华北城乡物资交流展览会的棉花馆，给观众指出了我国棉花生产的美丽远景。
    我国是一个农业国家，但是，在国民党统治时期，我国的棉粮却不能自给。一九四六年，国民党政府从外国输入的棉花，竟占国产棉花的百分之七十五以上。这种情况在我国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本的统治之后，很快就改变了。棉花馆中的华北植棉面积增减图表说明：如果以一九四七年植棉面积为一百，一九五一年为四百一十七；如果以一九三六年为一百，一九五一年为一百八十三。从全国棉花产量看，以抗日战争以前的五年平均数为一百，一九五○年已达一百一十一，超过百分之十一。今年将要超过更多。我国的棉纺织工业原料，已经接近于自给了。
    我国棉花生产不断进步，表现在许多方面。良种棉田的扩大，是最显著的事实。棉花馆的图表说明这种情况：如果把一九四九年的良种棉田面积作为
    一百，一九五○年激增至八百，一九五一年更激增至三千七百。山西省今年扩大的良种棉田的面积，相当于去年扩大数的八倍以上。
    为扩大植棉面积，增加棉花产量，人民政府曾经用极大的力量，奖励和扶持棉农。粮棉比价与优级优价政策的贯彻执行，使农民种棉的收入有了确定的保证。图表告诉人们：在国民党和日寇统治的时代，有过一九三八年的一斤棉换九斤小米的情况，但更多的年头，棉花比价是很低的。一九四○年，
    一斤棉只能换五斤多小米。曲耀离在一九四三年种了八亩棉花，收皮棉三百斤，只换到四百八十斤高粱。那时候种棉的农民，是丰收年也会挨饿的。人民政府规定了粮棉比价以后，再也没有这种现象了。此外，优良棉种的供应，肥料、农药、药械、新式农具的供应，贷款、保险等政策的实行，都促进了棉田扩大与棉花增产。
    曲耀离等植棉能手的丰产成绩，给予观众特别深刻的印象。大量的男女农民代表，挤在这些能手们种植的肥大的棉株跟前，倾听说明员们讲解他们增产的方法。曲耀离种的棉花，去年已经达到每亩产籽棉七百四十五斤，今年据估计可以产到八百三十六斤（尚未收下来）。河北石家庄农民梁家瑞、张君琦的棉花，估计一亩可产六百斤。临清的棉农周顺在旱地植棉，一亩也产四百七十斤。这些模范者们创造的纪录，使人们看到提高单位面积产量的广大可能性。华北现在每亩棉花的平均产量是九十一点八斤，如果每亩产量能够提高到曲耀离棉产量的四分之一，即二百斤左右，将使全华北的棉产增加一倍多。这对国家工业建设和人民生活的关系之大，是可以想见的。
    封建的土地制度、自然条件、灾害、并不科学的老经验，曾经把农民束缚了几千年。华北农民在党的领导下，推翻了封建的土地制度后，又开始和自然进行斗争了。曲耀离的棉田的土壤并不好，但他实行了许多优良的办法，改变这种自然条件。例如，以保墒的办法防旱；每年拔棉后马上整地，坚持犁两遍，耩两遍，磨四遍，耙两遍；在一亩棉田中施肥九千多斤；在棉苗根部割开小裂口，防止棉苗“长狂”；实行田间选种，并用热水和人尿拌种，等等。这些办法，使他获得惊人的丰收。平原省薛子亮在碱地植棉，每亩收获籽棉四百斤。碱地种棉，幼苗易于死亡，他创造了挖坑换土和堆土保墒的方法，终于战胜了自然条件的限制。河北通县专区的何玉春创造了在阳坡地育苗，然后移栽的办法，战胜了春寒对棉苗的袭击。平原省吕砚尚在麦茬地种棉时，实行开水烫种（二天即可出苗），并早施追肥，结果一亩地收获四百八十斤小麦，秋季又收了二百斤籽棉。
    推广这些丰产模范的宝贵经验，努力提高单位面积产量，那末，我国棉花生产量，将是不可限量的。（林章）（附图片）
