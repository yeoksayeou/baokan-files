    Fushun Mining Bureau Housing and Land Section Engineering Team
    Should Not Falsely Report New Construction as Major Repairs

    Editor:

    In making the 1951 major repair plan, the Engineering Team of the Housing and Land Section of the Liaodong Fushun Mining Bureau falsely reported two newly built houses as major repairs. It is said that this makes it easier to get money from higher authorities. The design drawings were put into construction without careful review by higher authorities, resulting in the bungalows built on East Second Road being very incompatible with the surrounding building environment, affecting the neatness of the city appearance. During the excavation of the foundation trenches for the building on West Third Road, the team did not anticipate that it would affect the foundation of the neighboring houses, resulting in the collapse of the earthwork of the neighboring houses. The team recently planned to replace 13,000 square meters of flooring in the residential area. This number is very inaccurate, and most of it does not need to be replaced, because not replacing it does not affect the safety of residence. This practice seriously violates the State Council's instructions on saving timber. During the quality inspection, Xie Xizhao, the technician and leader of the quality inspection team, raised the above opinions to Luo, the captain of the Engineering Team. Captain Luo said, "This is only your personal opinion, not the opinion of the team." I think this statement is incorrect. I hope the Engineering Team can review this issue.

### 抚顺矿务局房屋土地科工程总队  不应将新建筑谎报为大修理

    抚顺矿务局房屋土地科工程总队
    不应将新建筑谎报为大修理编辑同志：
    辽东抚顺矿务局房屋土地科工程总队，在作一九五一年大修理计划时，将两座新建的房屋，也谎报为大修理。据说这样容易向上级要钱。设计图样未经上级很好的审查，就开了工，致使建筑在东二路的平房，与四周楼房的环境很不相配，影响了市容的整齐。在建筑西三路楼房的挖地槽的工程中，因没有预料到会影响邻屋的地基，致使邻屋的土方发生崩塌。该队最近计划在住宅区新换地板一万三千平方公尺，这个数字是很不准确的，其中大部分不必换，因为不换并不影响居住的安全。这种作法严重违反了政务院关于节省木材的指示。在质量大检查时，质量检查小组长技术员谢犀照将上述的意见向工程总队罗总队长提出来，罗总队长说：“这仅仅是你个人的意见，不是小组的意见。”我想这种说法是不对的。希望工程总队能对此问题进行检讨。
