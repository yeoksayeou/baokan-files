The past was miserable enough
Now everyone is excited
Sino-Soviet friendship has penetrated the people
Recently, I had the opportunity to travel around the Northeast. The places I went to were Shenyang, Dalian, Lushun, Anshan, Fushun, Changchun, Jilin, and Harbin. On the way back, I also stopped in Tianjin. I saw a total of twenty-five units directly or indirectly related to production. Here, I don't want to report on the situation of each unit, but only want to say something general.

After seeing the Northeast, my first feeling was universal prosperity, and everyone was working hard together.

Everywhere you can see that the excellent cadres are very young. As a man over seventy, I asked the age of the person in charge of each unit. Adding his age to mine, the vast majority are always around one hundred years old. And when inquiring about various situations and various problems, they can generally answer me in great detail and honestly, which convinces me that he is the actual person in charge.

When visiting a factory, I prepared several questions in advance. After briefly talking about the history of the factory and the general situation of the setup, I would mention the production problem. The factories I saw all increased production in 1951 by at least several tens of percent compared to 1950 and 1949, and some even more than several tens of percent. I delved deeper and divided the factory's increased production into three categories: The first category is increased production due to increased capital and increased equipment; the second category is without increased equipment, but some machines were not used in the past, but now they are used, or they were damaged and are now repaired, thus increasing production; the third category has neither the first type of situation nor the second type of situation, only because the morale of the employees is high, or they work diligently, doing the work of ten or a dozen hours in eight hours, or the work method has been improved, and various "rationalization proposals" have emerged, making production increase. The first category accounts for a very small number, most are the second category combined with the third category, and the third category, either combined with the second category or not, actually accounts for the largest number.

After liberation, the production of various industries has recovered and increased, first in a certain industry, then in a certain industry, with its own certain rules. In short, all industries that face the people, especially face the countryside, and can solve their current urgent needs for production and consumption will develop, and will develop first. Conversely, they will decrease. This phenomenon is almost consistent everywhere, and the Northeast is no exception.

The increase in the work efficiency of workers in the Northeast is surprising. Not only factory work, but when I toured the Dalian port wharf, the loading and unloading efficiency of the freight workers there also rose in a straight line. In the past, each person worked twelve hours a day, now it has been reduced to eight hours. But in March of this year, the loading and unloading efficiency per worker has increased to an average of 8.4 tons, and in July it suddenly increased to an average of 12.4 tons. The reason is that the workers' political and cultural level has improved, and they all realize that they are the masters. I personally saw them unfolding textbooks and studying in small groups on the piles of goods. Because they have already realized that they are the masters, a sudden storm broke out in the middle of the night, and the tide rose immediately, and the workers scattered everywhere would automatically gather to rush to transport the grain in the warehouse that was about to be flooded.

Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, called for saving and increasing production of 5 million tons of grain. In less than two months, it was reported that the plan had reached 10 million tons. This is the specific manifestation of the Northeast people's universal efforts to work under the enthusiastic patriotic sentiment for the construction of the new China and for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.

Regarding the treatment of workers, I asked everywhere to disclose the figures of the highest and lowest wages. Probably the lowest, even child labor, can maintain the lives of one and a half to two people.

But in the middle of this, an important issue was discovered. Industrial construction is expanding year by year. Not to mention technical cadres, just talking about workers, can their sources increase proportionally to meet these needs? Their answers were mostly that there is no big problem this year, but it is hard to say in the future.

I estimate that there will be a worker shortage in the near future. While worrying about this, I saw the vast plains and large tracts of farmland on both sides of the railway, all relying on manpower and old-fashioned farm tools to work. I thought that in the future, the policy should be to save rural labor to supplement the shortage of factories, and the method is to quickly improve farm tools. On the way back, I visited, and this point has been seriously noted by the upper levels of the Northeast administration, so I visited the farm tool manufacturing factory. In order to save fuel, I don't want to promote power at this time. The factory is researching and manufacturing various improved farm tools using animal power.

This beautiful and fertile Northeast is actually the result of a fierce struggle history of more than fifty years. As Feng Zhongyun said in the inscription at the Harbin Martyrs Memorial Hall, "Blue blood has dyed the white mountains and black waters red," it was miserable enough.

I heard four common and specific names from the mouths of the common people: "Little Nose," "Big Nose," "Second Manchuria," and "Big Brother." After careful questioning and combining them, they accurately describe a history of struggle in the Northeast.

There are many fishing villages along the coast of Dalian—Dalian Bay was originally a fishing village "Qingniwa" a hundred years ago, which has expanded and evolved—I once visited a small Pingdao fishing village in the middle, and chatted with several fishermen:

"Well, now we have our own fishing boats, catching our own fish, handing it over to our own cooperative, and selling it freely." - said the fishermen.

"May I ask what it was like in the past?" - I said.

"Hey! The little noses forced us to hand over the fish we caught to their organization, let them set the price and buy it. If we left a few for the children to taste, they would beat us to death if they found out!" - said the fishermen.

"How much is your fishing boat worth?" - I asked.

"Two million." - answered the fishermen.

"So you all have this money?" - I asked.

"That's thanks to the help of our own government. It's called 'fishing loan.' The government lends us a sum of money to build a boat. When we catch fish and sell it, we gradually repay it." - said the fishermen.

A fisherman surnamed Kong jumped out and said: "Chiang Kai-shek is no good! I went to Zhoushan to fight, after being trained here collectively first. I am a fourth-class meritorious person! I saw Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers from a long distance. As soon as the fire started, they disappeared and fled. After Zhoushan was liberated, I also went to Shanghai and Nanjing, eating rice every day." As he said, he showed a proud attitude.

An old fisherman then said: "Hey! Don't say it, the little noses! It's always deserved. Their relatives' relatives are all fed, making us always gnaw on the indigestible 'acorn flour'. Ha! Ha! We finally have today." This is a record of my personal participation in conversations with groups of fishermen on Xiaoping Island.

Turning back, I asked people: What is a little nose? It turns out that the people of the Northeast generally call the Japanese "little noses," with hatred and contempt. This name came after the big noses. Before the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, part of the Northeast was occupied by Imperial Russia. The people called the Russians of the Imperial Russian era the big noses. What is "acorn flour"? The wild plants such as oaks and chestnuts are all over the mountains. Their fruits are taken and ground into flour, which is very inferior. Eating it will cause diarrhea, and the taste is spicy, making it difficult to swallow. The Japanese invaders plundered the good grain produced locally every year for their own consumption, and forced these on the people. This "acorn flour" was invented by Zhang Benzheng, a big traitor who was recently sentenced to death by the People's Government, and presented to the Japanese invaders.

The people of the Northeast suffered from the little noses for more than fifty years from the Sino-Japanese War in 1894 until they accepted their surrender in 1945. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, the people of the Northeast naively imagined that in the future, only their own central government and the people sent by their own central government would be saviors. But unexpectedly, the corruption and darkness of the troops and officials sent by Chiang Kai-shek greatly disappointed the people of the Northeast. The Manchurian government that ruled the Northeast in the past, its corruption and darkness, was recognized by all the people of the Northeast. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek's gang was simply the same as Manchuria. The people of the Northeast gave Chiang Kai-shek's gang a nickname called "Second Manchuria."

Who made the Japanese invaders surrender urgently in 1945? It was because the Soviet Union sent troops to the Northeast and drove away the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in the Northeast like a broken bamboo, forcing the Japanese invaders to realize that survival was hopeless and they could only surrender. The Northeast is the Northeast of the Chinese people. The Soviet Union then handed over the local government of the Northeast to the people of the Northeast.

After five or six years, according to what I personally saw and heard in Lushun and Dalian this time, the coastal fishermen, farmers, and citizens of Lushun and Dalian get along well with the Soviet troops, just like the people everywhere treat the People's Liberation Army. The reason is that Soviet soldiers often help the people with their work, helping with farm work during busy farming seasons, preventing floods and typhoons, and rushing to protect with the people, and also often providing medicine. --I lived in Dalian, and I personally saw a child next door fall from the stairs outside the wall and fall into a coma. The family was at a loss. A Soviet comrade rushed forward from the crowd to perform first aid.-- The Soviet Union has long returned the China Changchun Railway and the industrial and mining, hospital, cultural and various institutions attached to the railway to China. The Soviet-owned department store—Qiulin Company—pays taxes in the same way as Chinese private businesses. Originally selling Soviet goods, now most of them have been changed to sell Chinese goods. The reason is that the products of the Soviet socialist country are cheaper and more beautiful, and they are afraid of hindering the sales of Chinese national products; but if there is some kind of necessity that China does not have, Soviet products will be transported to supply it. The Soviet troops also use Chinese goods. For example, for cigarettes, the Soviet troops also use Chinese cigarettes. If it is not enough, they will transport Soviet cigarettes to supplement it. The people of the Northeast, trapped in a long-term environment of high degree of suffering, suddenly received such warm treatment, and of course they would respond with warmth and automatically and unanimously call the Soviet people "Big Brother."

In the past, the long-term and high-degree suffering of the people in the Northeast is truly unspeakable. Just in the places I have visited this time: Lushun has the "Wan Zhong Tomb." In the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, the Japanese invaders slaughtered the citizens of Lushun from house to house, regardless of men, women, old or young, for three days and three nights. Only in the area at the eastern foot of Baiyu Mountain, more than 18,000 corpses were buried. This place where the corpses were buried has been marked as the "Wan Zhong Tomb" after liberation. There is a tower on Baiyu Mountain, which is a shameful merit tower of the Japanese invaders defeating Imperial Russia. I suggested to the citizens of Lushun to rename it "Wan Zhong Tower." There is a mountain named "Pingdingshan" south of Fushun City. Many righteous people were concentrated and slaughtered there by the Japanese invaders. Every year on the memorial day, many people go to cry and worship. There are probably many other places like this. The Harbin Martyrs Memorial Hall commemorates the victims of the Anti-Japanese War and the victims of the struggle with Chiang Kai-shek. There are also women and a few Koreans among them. The walls and tables are full of portraits, manuscripts, and relics, displayed in room after room. What is especially horrifying is the human heads, one by one. Among them, General Yang Jingyu, who went through the most arduous war, was killed and dissected. There were only grass roots and bark in his abdomen, without a single grain.

From the "September 18th" Incident when the Japanese invaders began their invasion, groups of volunteers sprang up everywhere. It was simply a case of one person falling down and thousands of people standing up. During the fourteen years of occupation, it never stopped. But in terms of strength, it was ultimately thanks to the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army led by the Communist Party of China that had a strict organization and a whole plan. The final establishment of the people's regime was achieved on this point.

What I saw this time, the Changchun Central Bank operated by the puppet Manchukuo regime - now changed to the People's Bank, is simply a fortress. There are also extremely solid two-story buildings below the ground, with drinks, electric lights, telephones, radios, steel doors, steel cabinets, warehouses, canteens, kitchens, automatic document transmitters and everything. Walking in there is like seeing the secret room where Hitler finally committed suicide in the movie "Conquest of Berlin." I didn't expect the Japanese invaders to be so timid, making these preparations early. In the end, this cave was used by Zheng Dongguo as a place to resist and be captured during the final liberation of Changchun. I remember Chairman Mao had a sentence like this: "Only the power of the people is a copper wall and iron wall." This is absolutely correct.

This time I went to the Northeast, it happened to be after the flood. Some people who participated in the disaster relief work told me: Many people kowtowed to Chairman Mao from afar to thank him. There was an old woman in Kaiyuan who said: "I have lived for ninety-seven years, and I have never seen such a big flood, but I have never seen such a good government and such a good army."

Yes. It is the people's government and army, it is the people's Northeast, it is the people's China.

### 我所看到的人民的东北

专栏：

    我所看到的人民的东北
    黄炎培
    过去种种够惨了
    现在一致地兴奋了
    中苏友好深入民间了
    最近我有机会去东北走了一遍，到的地方是沈阳、大连、旅顺、鞍山、抚顺、长春、吉林、哈尔滨，归途还在天津歇了一下，看到了直接间接有关生产的共二十五个单位。在这里不想报告各个单位的情况，只愿说些大概。
    我看了东北以后，首先感觉到普遍的繁荣，大家一致地在努力。
    到处可以看到优秀干部很年青。以年过七十的我，试问每一个单位负责者的年龄，把他的和我的并计起来，绝大多数总在一百岁左右。而询谈到种种情况，种种问题，一般都能很详尽地很忠诚老实地答复给我听，使我确信他是个实际主持者。
    看工厂我预拟好若干问题，略谈设厂历史和设置大概情形以外，就要提到生产问题了。我所看到的工厂，至少是一九五一年比一九五○年、一九四九年生产增加到百分之几十，有些还不止百分之几十。我深一层追问下去了，先把工厂增产分做三类：第一类是因增加资本，增加设备而增产的；第二类没有增加设备，但过去部分机器没有使用，现在使用了，或已毁损，现修理好了，因此而增加生产；第三类没有第一类情况，也并没有第二类情况，只因员工情绪高涨，或工作勤快，八小时做了平常十小时十几小时的工作，或工作方法有所改进，出现种种“合理化建议”，而使生产增加。第一类占极少数，大都是第二类兼第三类，而第三类或兼第二类的，或不兼的，实占最大多数。
    解放以后，各业生产由恢复而增加，先某业，后某业，有其一定的规律。总之凡面向人民，特别是面向农村，能解决它们当前生产与消费迫切需要的行业都发展，而且首先发展。反之减少。这种现象各地方几乎一致，东北并不例外。
    东北工人工作效能的增进，使人吃惊。不单是工厂工作，我游览大连港湾码头，那里的运货工人的装卸效率也是直线上升的。过去每人每日十二小时为一工，今减为八小时了。但今年三月份每工装卸效率已经提高到平均八吨又四百公斤，七月份又突然提高到平均十二吨又四百公斤。原因是工人政治、文化水平提高了，他们都认识了自己是主人翁。我亲见他们一小组一小组在货堆上展开课本学习。因为已经认识到自己是主人翁，半夜里暴风雨突发，海潮立时上涨，散在四处的工人们会自动地集中抢运仓库里快要被淹的粮食。
    东北人民政府高岗主席号召节约增产五百万吨粮食，不到两个月，报载计划已达一千万吨。这就是东北人民为了新中国生产建设，为了抗美援朝，普遍地在狂热的爱国情绪鼓舞下努力作工的具体表现。
    关于工人的待遇，我到处要求开示最高和最低工资的数字。大概最低的连童工还能维持一个半到两个人的生活。
    但在这中间发现一个重要问题。工业建设年年扩大。技术干部且不说，只说工人，他们的来源是否能比例增加，来适应这些需要？他们的答复，大都是今年还没有大问题，今后难说。
    我估计到最近的将来会闹工人荒。正愁虑间，看到铁路两旁广漠的平原，大片的农田，都还是靠人力，靠旧式农具在工作。因想今后政策，只有节约农村劳动力，来补充工厂的不足，方法在赶快改良农具。归途访问，这点已为东北行政上级严重注意，因参观了农具制造厂。为了节约燃料，此时还不想提倡动力，该厂正一面研究，一面制造用兽力的各种改良农具。
    这一片锦天绣地的东北，实际上是五十多年一部酷烈的斗争史所构成的结果。正如冯仲云在哈尔滨烈士纪念馆题词所说，“碧血染红了白山黑水”，是够惨的了。
    我从老百姓嘴里听到四个普遍的特定的名称：“小鼻子”，“大鼻子”，“二满洲”，“老大哥”。细细地追问一下，配合起来，恰恰是正确地描写了一部东北斗争史。
    大连沿海有不少渔村——大连湾原来是百年前一个渔村“青泥洼”扩大演变起来的——我曾经访问过中间一个小平岛渔村，和几起渔民漫谈：
    “好了，现在是我们自己的渔船，打自己的鱼，交给自己的合作社，自由出卖了。”——渔民说。
    “请问过去怎样呢？”——我说。
    “嘿！小鼻子们，硬要我们把自己打来的鱼，交给他们的组合，由得他们定价收买，要是留下几条给小孩子们尝尝味儿，给他们知道了，要打死哩！”——渔民说。
    “你们的渔船值价多少钱一条呢？”——我问。
    “二百万。”——渔民答。
    “那么你们都有这笔钱么？”——我问。
    “那是靠自家的政府帮忙的了。这叫做‘渔贷’，政府贷给我们一笔钱，来打船，等到打起鱼来卖掉，陆续陆续地归还。”——渔民说。
    一位孔姓渔民跳出来说了：“蒋介石是不行的！我到舟山去打过仗，先在这里集体受了训的。我是四等功臣啊！我老远望见了蒋介石的兵，一开火，便不见了，逃了。舟山解放了以后，我还到过上海、南京，天天吃大米。”一面说，一面表示出洋洋得意的气态。
    一位年老的渔民接着说了：“嘿！不要说了，小鼻子们！总是活该的，他们亲戚的亲戚都喂饱了，累得我们老是啃那吞不下去的‘橡子面’。哈！哈！我们到底有今天。”这是我和小平岛一群一群的渔民亲身参加谈话的纪录。
    回头我问人家了：什么是小鼻子呢？原来东北老百姓们普遍地称日本人为小鼻子，带着愤恨和鄙贱的意思，这名称还是跟着大鼻子而来的。一九○四年日俄之战以前的东北，部分是给帝俄占领着的，老百姓称帝俄时代的俄国人就是大鼻子。什么是“橡子面”呢？满山遍地的橡、栗等野生植物，取它们的果实磨制成面，性很劣，吃下去，会腹泻，味又辣，很难下咽。日寇每年把地方所产好粮掠去自己吃，而把这些强迫配给人民。这“橡子面”是最近人民政府判处死刑的大汉奸张本政发明，献给日寇的。
    东北老百姓还是从一八九四年甲午之战起吃了小鼻子五十多年的苦，到一九四五年才接受他的投降。日寇投降了，东北老百姓们天真的想像，今后只有自己的中央，自己中央派来的人，才是救星。而不料蒋介石派去的军队和官员贪污黑暗种种腐化，使东北老百姓们大大地失望。过去统治东北的满洲政府，它的贪污黑暗腐化，是全东北老百姓公认的，料不到蒋介石一帮人简直和满洲一样，东北老百姓们就替蒋介石一帮人起一个浑名，叫做“二满洲”。
    一九四五年谁使日寇急促地投降的呢？就为是苏联东北出兵，势如破竹地赶走了日寇驻在东北的关东军，迫使日寇觉悟到生存绝望，只有投降。东北是中国人民的东北。苏联接下来就把东北地方政权交还给东北人民了。
    经过了五六年，就我这回在旅大亲身看到听到的，沿海渔民农民和旅大市民跟苏联驻军的将士们相处得和好，恰和各地民众对解放军一样。原因是苏联士兵们经常地帮助人民工作，农忙时帮助农事，防汛防台，和民众一道抢护，还经常地施送医药。——我住大连，亲见邻家一孩从墙外楼梯跌下，昏迷着，家人束手，一苏联同志从群众中抢前施行急救。——苏联早把中长铁路和铁路附设的工矿、医院、文化各种机构一概交还给中国了。苏联公营的百货公司——秋林公司，他们和中国民营商业一样的纳税。原卖苏联货，现在绝大部分改卖中国货了，原因是苏联社会主义国家产品价较廉，物较美，怕阻碍中国国货的销路；但如某种必需品中国没有时，会运苏联产品来供应。苏联驻军也用中国货，例如纸烟，苏军也用中国烟，不够，才运苏联烟来补充。东北民众陷在长期的高度的水深火热的环境里，忽然获得这样亲热的待遇，当然会报以亲热的反应，便自动地一致地称苏联人“老大哥”。
    过去东北民众长期的高度的水深火热，真是一言难尽，仅就我这回所到地方来说：旅顺有“万忠墓”，一八九四年甲午那年日寇把旅顺市民不分男女老幼挨户屠杀了三昼夜，仅白玉山东麓一区收埋了一万八千多人的尸骨，这收埋尸骨的地方，解放以后标志为“万忠墓”。白玉山有塔，是可耻的日寇战胜帝俄的纪功塔，我向旅顺市民建议，改名为“万忠塔”。抚顺市南边有山名“平顶山”，许多义民给日寇在那里集中屠杀，年年纪念日，许多人去哭祭。其他地点，类此者怕还不少。哈尔滨烈士纪念馆，一部分纪念抗日斗争的死难者，一部分纪念和蒋介石斗争死难者，中间也有女的，也有少数朝鲜籍。满壁满案都是遗像、遗墨、遗物，一室一室陈列着。尤其可骇的，是一颗一颗人头。其中经过最艰苦战争的杨靖宇将军被杀剖腹，腹中只有草根树皮，无一谷粒。
    东北从“九一八”日寇开始侵略，到处一组一组义勇军纷纷而起，简直是一人倒下去，千万人站起来，沦陷十四年间，从来没有中断。但论力量，到底仰仗中国共产党领导的东北人民抗日联军有严密的组织，有整个的计划。最后的建立人民政权，收功在这点上。
    这回我所看到的，日伪经营的长春中央银行——现改为人民银行，简直是一座堡垒。地平以下还有极坚固的两层建筑，饮料、电灯、电话、无线电、钢门、钢柜的库房、食堂、厨房、文件自动传达器和一切一切，走进那里，竟像从“攻克柏林”电影中间看到希特拉最后自杀的那间密室。我想不到日寇这样胆怯，早早做这些准备工夫。末了，这座窟室，恰在长春最后解放时，给郑洞国做了负隅就缚的场所。记得毛主席有这样一句话：“只有人民的力量，才是铜墙铁壁。”这是绝对正确的。
    这回去东北，恰值水灾过后，有参加救灾工作者告我：不少老百姓遥遥地向毛主席叩头道谢。开原有一位老太婆，她说：“我活了九十七岁，从没有看到这样大的水灾，但也从没有看到这样好的政府，这样好的军队。”
    是的。是人民的政府和军队，是人民的东北，是人民的中国。
    一九五一年九月
