    Telegram of Congratulations to General Kim Il-sung
    To Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung:
    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to fight abroad, please accept our heartfelt gratitude and high respect from all the Chinese people to you, and through you to all commanders, fighters, and the entire Korean people of the Korean People's Army. Over the past year, the Chinese People's Volunteers, under your unified command, have fought victoriously together with the Korean People's Army. The common victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples has greatly encouraged the people of our two countries, as well as all peace-loving and democratic people in Asia and the world, strengthening their victorious confidence in defending peace and opposing aggression. We assure you that all 475 million people of China will continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea with one heart and one mind, and fully support the just struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army until the victory of this struggle is achieved.
    Long live the great friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, consolidated in the common struggle!
