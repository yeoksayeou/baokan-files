    Be Vigilant Against the Intrusion of Bourgeois Reactionary Ideologies and Work Styles

    Some Communist Party members with wavering wills cannot withstand the intrusion of bourgeois reactionary ideologies and work styles, and engage in serious acts of corruption and degeneration, harming the interests of the Party and the people. According to the Northeast Daily, Ji Xilin, the head of the Communications Section of the Northeast Navigation Bureau and a Communist Party member, was seduced by local gangster Wu Yishu and the owner of the unscrupulous Lilic Telecommunications Equipment Factory when he went to Shanghai to purchase communications equipment in May of last year, and engaged in corruption and degeneration, spending over 40 million yuan of public funds. The machines ordered from the Lilic Telecommunications Equipment Factory also had serious design flaws and were made with shoddy workmanship, so that after being transported to the Northeast, they were found to be completely unusable after inspection. Including other losses, the total value was approximately 1 billion yuan.

    Communist Party members must have the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly and not be intruded upon by all non-proletarian ideologies and work styles. Ji Xilin lacked the basic thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, and therefore could not withstand the seduction of unscrupulous merchants, engaged in corruption and violated the law, acted recklessly, and developed to an intolerable degree. It is absolutely necessary for the Party to give Ji Xilin the punishment of expulsion from the Party and for the government to punish him according to law. Without eliminating such corrupt and degenerate elements, it is impossible to guarantee the purity of the Party and the revolutionary ranks, and it is impossible to consolidate and improve the combat effectiveness of the Party and the revolutionary ranks.

    From Ji Xilin's mistakes, we should learn the following lesson: unscrupulous merchants use all means to tempt our revolutionary workers. Their purpose is not only to cause economic losses to the revolution and the people, but more seriously, they attempt to politically disintegrate our revolutionary ranks. Therefore, we must always raise our political vigilance and always be vigilant against the intrusion of bourgeois reactionary ideas.

    警惕资产阶级反动思想作风的侵袭
    有些意志不坚定的共产党员，经不起资产阶级反动思想作风的侵袭，发生严重的贪污腐化行为，损害了党和人民的利益。据东北日报载：东北航务总局通讯科长、共产党员季喜林，于去年五月间到上海采购通信器材时，受当地流氓伍贻书和奸商理立电信器材厂厂主的引诱，贪污腐化，花去公款四千余万元。而在理立电信器材厂订购的机器，也因为设计上有严重错误，制造时又被偷工减料，以致运到东北以后，经过检验，全部不能使用。连上其他损失，共约值十亿元。
    共产党员，必须具有全心全意为人民服务的思想，不被一切非无产阶级思想作风侵袭，季喜林却缺乏全心全意为人民服务的基本思想，因而经不起奸商的引诱，贪污枉法，胡作非为，并且发展到不可容忍的地步。党给予季喜林开除党籍的处分、政府依法予以惩办，是十分必要的。不清除这种贪污蜕化分子，就不能保证党和革命队伍的纯洁，就不能巩固和提高党和革命队伍的战斗力。
    从季喜林的错误中，应当取得这样的教训：奸商是利用一切手段来诱惑我们革命工作人员的。其目的，不只是想造成革命与人民经济上的损失，更为严重的是它企图从政治上瓦解我们的革命队伍。因此我们一定要时刻提高政治警觉，时刻警惕资产阶级的反动思想的侵袭。
