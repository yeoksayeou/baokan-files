(Xinhua News Agency Dispatch) Our nation's labor union organizations continue to support the just struggle of the twenty innocent defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident," and demand that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida and Sendai High Court President Teijiro Suzuki, among others, immediately release them. On the 20th, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese News, Publishing, and Printing Workers' Union sent a telegram to all defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," expressing their respect. The telegram stated: "Although the iron bars of the prison have confined your bodies, the calls for just struggle that you have spread from the prison have resounded throughout the world and ignited the flames of sympathy and anger in the broad masses of the people. This is undoubtedly a heavy blow to the barbaric rulers!" The Preparatory Committee of the union also sent telegrams to Teijiro Suzuki and Sendai High Court Judges Sasaki and Takahashi, strongly protesting the original judgments they made against the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and demanding the unconditional release of these defendants.
    Sun Dusheng, Chairman of the Chinese Salt Industry Workers' Union, on behalf of the 450,000 salt industry workers in China, sent telegrams to Yoshida and Suzuki on the 17th, demanding that they immediately release the twenty Japanese patriotic workers in the "Matsukawa Incident."
