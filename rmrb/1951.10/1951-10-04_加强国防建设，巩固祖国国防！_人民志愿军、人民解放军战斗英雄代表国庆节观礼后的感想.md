    Strengthen National Defense, Consolidate the Motherland's Defense!
    —Reflections of Representatives of Combat Heroes of the People's Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army After Watching the National Day Ceremony
   “I really saw Chairman Mao!”
    Wang Zhirong, Representative of Combat Heroes of the People's Volunteer Army at the National Day Ceremony
    On September 27th, Comrade Hu, who was in charge of our group, told us: “Tomorrow Chairman Mao will invite you to a banquet at Huairen Hall.” I was very happy when I heard this news. It was only 12 o'clock at noon at that time, and I thought to myself, "Will it get dark soon! So that I can see Chairman Mao tomorrow." After the meal, the comrades went out to play, but I sat in the room thinking: What should I say to the leader when I see him! The more I thought about it, the more excited I became, and the slower time seemed to pass.
    On the morning of the 30th, we visited Longevity Hill. It was not until 6:30 in the afternoon that we went to the banquet. The first people we met were Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Vice Chairman Song, Vice Chairman Li, Vice Chairman Zhang, Premier Zhou, and Acting Chief of Staff Nie. All the leaders shook hands with us kindly, asked how we were doing, and asked about the situation of our troops, showing concern for us everywhere. When I saw that all the leaders were in good health, I felt like a flower was blooming in my heart, and I was so happy that I didn't know what to do. After a while, the military band played the tune of "The East is Red." In the singing, our leader Chairman Mao came. The applause of the crowd was thunderous. At this time, I really hated that I was too short. Later, I stood in front of combat hero Zhang Xiaocai to see our great leader clearly. At that time, I thought: I must defend our motherland, I must defend our beloved Chairman Mao. I am a volunteer soldier. Only by returning to Korea and telling all our comrades about this situation, winning more battles, and capturing more American devils can I thank Chairman Mao and all the central leaders for their care and love for us. Resolutely defend our beloved motherland!
    Chai Erren, Combat Hero of the People's Liberation Army,
    Representative at the National Day Ceremony
    I am truly indescribably happy to be able to participate in the grand ceremony of the great National Day. I saw magnificent formations pass the reviewing stand on the viewing platform, including the powerful army, navy and air force, workers, farmers, comrades from government departments, students, and cultural and artistic forces... Everyone enthusiastically cheered towards Tiananmen Square: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" This sincere enthusiasm moved me greatly. When I saw our powerful army, navy, and air force equipped with the latest weapons marching past the reviewing stand in neat steps, I felt like flowers were blooming in my heart. How fast our national defense force has developed! I had never seen these weapons before, but now they are equipping our troops, which has increased my infinite confidence in building our great motherland and defending our motherland's sacred mission. I thought to myself: After I return to the unit, I must quickly learn to master these modern weapons, and I must ensure that all the comrades in our company master them in order to defend our beloved motherland.
    Be Ready to Respond to the Motherland's Call at Any Time
    Ma Chunyu, Combat Hero of the People's Liberation Army,
    Representative at the National Day Ceremony
    When I received Chairman Mao's invitation to a banquet on the afternoon of September 30th, I felt particularly excited, because the great leader Chairman Mao, whom I have long admired and longed to see, would meet us tonight. It is already a great honor to see Chairman Mao, but it is an even greater honor to be able to eat with Chairman Mao today. This is something I never expected.
    At the banquet, we saw representatives of the old revolutionary base areas, old uncles and aunts, and representatives of farmers from various places, as well as other representatives, gathered together, which symbolized that the people of the whole country are united under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Our Chinese people are invincible.
    When we arrived at the venue, Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the central leaders warmly welcomed us and shook hands with us. When our great leader Chairman Mao entered the venue, the music of "The East is Red" and thunderous applause resounded. At that time, I really felt that Chairman Mao was like the sun in winter, warmly shining on me, reminding me of the progress I had made in the past wars and work, under the education and encouragement of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and became a combat hero. This is truly my most glorious thing.
    At the meeting, the heroes and representatives frequently toasted Chairman Mao, toasting to Chairman Mao's good health. Comrade Ma Yuqing, a model medical worker, toasted Chairman Mao on behalf of our Northeast Military Region. He said: "I toast Chairman Mao, wish Chairman Mao good health, and shake hands with Chairman Mao. I am really indescribably happy! After I return to my post, I must intensify my work so that the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army can recover soon and return to the front line in Korea to kill American devils again." When I was about to leave, the comrades in our unit all asked me to say hello to Chairman Mao on their behalf. I want to tell these glorious things to the comrades, and they will definitely jump for joy.
    The achievements of the motherland's construction in the past two years under the leadership of Chairman Mao are truly unpredictable. The people's awareness is constantly improving. In terms of national defense construction, it is even more amazing. In the past, during the Liberation War, as soon as we saw a plane, we knew it was the enemy's without thinking; but today it is completely different. We not only have a strong army, but also a fairly strong air force and navy, and fully modernized troops. After I return to the unit, I will definitely work with all the comrades to resolutely implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders, step up the study of modern military science, learn the joint operations of various services, and await orders, ready to respond to the motherland's call at any time and strike at the aggressors.
    Forever Follow Chairman Mao
    Chen Zhuoxun, Representative of the People's Liberation Army at the National Day Ceremony
    Last year, when I participated in the National Day celebration in the capital, I was in the ranks of the mechanical workers. This year, I participated in the celebration as a representative of the People's Liberation Army at the National Day Ceremony. What excited me the most was that our beloved leader Chairman Mao also invited us to drink wine, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu also clinked glasses with us. These things will always make me feel honored. On the day of the drinking, I also saw the peasants from the old revolutionary base areas, who sincerely toasted and congratulated Chairman Mao, expressing their gratitude and love for the leader.
    Seeing Chairman Mao's healthy body, I am glad that this is the happiness of our workers, farmers, and the people of the whole country. With Chairman Mao, our happy life is guaranteed. I want to follow Chairman Mao forever, study hard, be a brave soldier of Chairman Mao, stand firmly on the front line of defending the motherland, and be ready to strike at the crazy aggressors at any time.

    加强国防建设，巩固祖国国防！
    ——人民志愿军、人民解放军战斗英雄代表国庆节观礼后的感想
   “我可真看见毛主席啦！”
    人民志愿军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表  王芝荣
    九月二十七日那天，带队的胡同志告诉我们：“明天毛主席在怀仁堂请你们。”我听到这个消息之后，心里非常高兴，那个时候才晌午十二点钟，我心想：“天快黑了吧！到明天我好去看主席。”饭后同志们出去玩去了，我却坐在屋里想：我见了领袖说些什么好哩！越想越兴奋，也越觉得时间过得慢。
    三十日上午，我们游万寿山。到下午六点半钟我们才去赴宴会，首先见到的是朱总司令、宋副主席、李副主席、张副主席、周总理、聂代总参谋长。各位首长都和我们亲切的握手，问我们身体好，问我们的部队情形，处处都关心着我们。我看到各位首长身体都很健康，我心里就像开了一朵花似的，高兴得不知道怎样才好。不一会，军乐奏着东方红的曲子，在歌声中，我们的领袖毛主席来了。大伙儿的掌声响成一片，这时候我真恨自己的个子太矮，后来我站到战斗英雄张孝才的前面去，才看清了我们伟大的领袖。当时我想：一定要保卫我们的祖国，一定要保卫我们敬爱的毛主席。我是一个志愿军，只有回到朝鲜把这些情形告诉给我们全体同志，多打胜仗，多捉美国鬼子，来感谢毛主席以及中央各位首长对我们的关怀和爱护。坚决保卫我们可爱的祖国！
    人民解放军战斗英雄
    国庆节观礼代表  柴二仁
    我能够参加伟大的国庆节盛大的典礼，心眼里真有说不出的高兴。我在观礼台上看到了雄伟的队伍走过检阅台，有强大的陆空海军，有工人、农民，有机关里的同志，有学生，还有文艺大军……。大家都万分兴奋地向天安门上欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”那种真挚的热情使我非常感动。当我看到我们强大的用最新式武器装备的陆空海军以整齐的步伐走过检阅台时，我的心里像开了花，我们的国防力量发展得多快啊！这些武器我从前都没看见过，现在却装备着我们的部队，使我对建设我们伟大的祖国，保卫我们祖国的神圣任务增加了无限信心。我联想到：我回部队后，一定要很快学会掌握这些现代化武器，一定要使我们全连的同志们都掌握它，以保卫我们可爱的祖国。
    随时准备响应祖国的召唤
    人民解放军战斗英雄
    国庆节观礼代表  马春雨
    在九月三十日下午，当我接到毛主席举行宴会的请帖以后，我感到特别兴奋，因为我久所敬爱和想望的伟大领袖毛主席，今天晚上，就要和我们见面了。本来见到毛主席就很光荣，而今天又能和毛主席在一块吃饭，更是最大的光荣。这是我过去没有想到的。
    我们在宴会上，看到了老根据地的代表老大爷和老大娘，看到了各地农民代表以及其他代表，齐聚一堂，这象征着全国人民在毛主席领导下团结起来了。我们中国人民是不可被战胜的。
    我们到达会场时，朱总司令和中央各首长热情地迎接着我们，和我们握手。当我们伟大领袖毛主席进入会场的时候，“东方红”的音乐声和震耳的掌声响成一片。当时我真感到毛主席像冬天的太阳，温暖地照耀着我，使我回想起在过去的战争和工作中，在毛主席和共产党的教养和鼓舞下获得了进步，成了战斗英雄，这真是我最光荣的事。
    在会上，英雄们和代表们都频频地向毛主席敬酒，为毛主席的身体健康而干杯。代表我们东北军区向毛主席敬酒的，是医务工作模范马玉清同志，他说：“我向毛主席敬酒，祝毛主席身体健康，并和毛主席握手，我心里真是有说不出来的高兴！我以后回到工作岗位上，更要加紧工作，使志愿军的伤病员早日恢复健康，好回朝鲜前线再杀美国鬼子。”在我临来的时候，我们部队里的同志们，都叫我代他们向毛主席问好。我想把这些光荣的事情告诉同志们，他们一定会乐的跳起来的。
    祖国在毛主席的领导下，两年来的建设成就，真是使人难以预料的。人民的觉悟不断提高。在国防建设方面，更是令人惊奇。过去在解放战争中，我们一看到飞机，不用想，就知是敌人的；而今天可完全不同了，我们不但有一支强大的陆军，而且有
    一支相当强大的空军和海军，有完全现代化的部队。我回部队后，一定和全体同志一起，坚决地执行朱总司令的命令，加紧学习现代的军事科学，学好各兵种的联合作战，听候命令，随时准备响应祖国召唤，打击侵略者。
    永远地跟着毛主席
    人民解放军国庆节观礼代表  陈卓勋
    去年在首都参加国庆节庆祝大会时，我在机械工人的行列中。今年的国庆节，我更以人民解放军国庆节观礼代表的名义参加了庆典。最使我兴奋的，是我们亲爱的领袖毛主席还请我们喝了酒，朱总司令还找我们碰了杯，这些事将永远使我感到光荣。在喝酒那天，我还看见了老根据地的农民，他们衷心地向毛主席敬酒、祝贺，表达他们对领袖的感激和热爱。
    我看见毛主席健康的身体，我心里庆幸这是我们工人、农民以及全国人民的幸福。有了毛主席，我们幸福生活就有了保障。我要永远地跟着毛主席，努力学习，作毛主席的一个勇敢的战士，坚决地站在保卫祖国的最前线，随时准备打击疯狂的侵略者。
