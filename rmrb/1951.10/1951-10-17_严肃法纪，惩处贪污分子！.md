    Enforce Law and Discipline Sternly, Punish Corrupt Elements!
    Guo Rulin Abused Power for Embezzlement and Bribery
    Sentenced to Death by the Pingyuan Provincial People's Court
    Editor:
    Guo Rulin, a working cadre of the Justice Section of Junxian County, Pingyuan Province, abused his power, embezzled, and perverted the law, seriously damaging the prestige of the People's Government among the masses. After review by the Supreme People's Court, the criminal was executed by firing squad in Junxian County.
    Guo Rulin served as a clerk in the Japanese puppet army for six years. In 1941, he infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and was transferred to work in the Junxian County Justice Section in July 1949. After infiltrating the People's Government, Guo consistently violated laws and regulations, engaged in embezzlement and bribery. According to statistics from 1946 to 1950 alone, Guo committed 26 violations. For example, Shen Kaicheng, a rich peasant in Shenwan Village, Erqu District of the county, violated government laws and regulations during the land reform and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Guo, however, embezzled 200,000 yuan in bribes and allowed Shen Kaicheng to be released on bail pending trial. He Hejucai, a counter-revolutionary criminal from Liuqu District of the county, was arrested, but Guo released him after accepting a bribe of 300,000 yuan. Guo's criminal acts of embezzlement and perversion of the law seriously affected the prestige of the People's Government among the masses.
    After the leading cadres of the county discovered the above facts, they sent personnel to investigate and immediately arrested Guo. Upon receiving the report, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Court organized an investigation team and rushed to Junxian County for trial, sentencing Guo to death in accordance with the law. Guo refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme People's Court. On July 11th, the Supreme People's Court approved the original judgment, and the Pingyuan Provincial People's Court ordered the Junxian County People's Government to execute the sentence. On August 13th, the Junxian County People's Government held a mass meeting of more than 3,000 people, where the criminal was executed by firing squad on the spot. All cases of Guo's embezzlement, extortion of property from the masses, were re-examined and dealt with according to law.

    Zhang Jincai, County Chief of Jiaocheng County, and Others贪图 Embezzled State Property to Satisfy Personal Enjoyment
    Dismissed from Office and Handed Over for Legal Action
    Editor:
    Zhang Jincai, the county chief of Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, and others engaged in malfeasance, seriously damaging state property, and have received the punishment they deserve. The Jiaocheng County People's Government opened a lumber mill in the winter of 1949, earning more than 100,000 catties of millet. In April 1950, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Finance Committee instructed the Jiaocheng People's Government to transfer the entire lumber mill to the management of the Provincial Forestry Bureau. Zhang Jincai repeatedly refused to hand over the mill and privately ordered Ma Jixin, chief of the Finance and Grain Section, to fabricate accounts, concealing state property amounting to more than 73,000 catties of millet and falsely claiming transportation costs of more than 36,000 catties. After the transfer of the lumber mill, Zhang Jincai repeatedly requested subsidies from the Fenyang Prefectural Office, citing the difficulty of the agency's funding. Without investigation, the prefectural office requested instructions from the Provincial Finance Committee. The Forestry Bureau discovered the problem and raised objections to the Provincial Finance Committee. However, the Provincial Finance Committee did not adopt the Forestry Bureau's opinion and decided to allocate a subsidy of 150,000 catties of millet to the county. Later, the Fenyang Prefectural Office discovered the true situation and repeatedly urged the Jiaocheng County Government to report the facts, but Zhang Jincai only reported bank deposits of 50 million yuan while concealing more than 300 bolts of existing foreign cloth. In order to pursue personal enjoyment, Zhang Jincai arbitrarily squandered state property, spending more than 3,000 catties of public millet on the purchase of clothing and other daily necessities alone.
    In order to cover up his crimes, Zhang Jincai allocated large sums of public funds to bribe county and district cadres. As a result, the financial situation of Jiaocheng County fell into extreme chaos, and some unscrupulous cadres took the opportunity to spend and borrow recklessly, with no one daring to offer criticism.
    The Shanxi Provincial People's Supervisory Committee discovered the above situation and gave the parties concerned the punishment they deserved. In addition to recovering all the public property embezzled by Zhang Jincai and others, they were dismissed from their posts and handed over to the court for legal action. Other relevant cadres were given demerits, criticisms, and other punishments according to the severity of their circumstances.
                        Xu Buyuan, Wang Zhouxi, Li Donglin, and Others Stole and Sold State-Owned Medicines
    Received Legal Sanctions Respectively
    Editor:
    Li Donglin, Rong Yunqing, and other cadres of the Materials Section of the Logistics Department of the Northwest Military Region Health Department stole and sold state-owned medicines, books, and other items, causing serious losses to state property. The Xi'an Municipal People's Court has punished them accordingly.
    In February 1950, Li Donglin, Rong Yunqing, and others stole a box (6 kilograms) of amino sulfonamide (anti-inflammatory powder) from the Materials Section. Li and Rong agreed that Ma Zhaofang (who was working in the section at the time) would collude with a private businessman surnamed Gao to resell it. In order to transport all the medicines out as soon as possible, Li Donglin conspired with Liu Fuxiang, He Yaozu, Wu Zhennan, Li Laihou, Feng Shiqi, and others who were working in the section to help transport them and agreed that "if discovered by others, no one can tell on anyone." After that, they colluded with Dang Wenjie of the Red Cross Hospital, businessman Zhao Wenxuan, Lei Baoshan, and others to continue stealing public medicines. In addition to collective theft, each criminal individually stole medicines, books, and other public items. A total of 35 kinds of medicines, 71 books, and 21 other items were stolen, causing great losses to state property.
    In order to enforce law and discipline and educate all cadres, in addition to handing over Ma Zhaofang to the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee for handling, the Northwest People's Supervisory Committee gave Li Donglin, Rong Yunqing, Liu Fuxiang, Wu Zhennan, and others the punishment of dismissal. The Xi'an Municipal People's Court also sentenced Li Donglin and Rong Yunqing to seven years' imprisonment each, Liu Fuxiang to five years' imprisonment, Wu Zhennan to two years, and Ma Zhaofang to one year and six months. He Yaozu, because he voluntarily confessed his crimes, helped to solve the case, and made a relatively deep self-criticism afterward, was treated leniently and given a major demerit.

    严肃法纪，惩处贪污分子！
    郭儒林利用职权贪赃枉法
    被平原省人民法院判处死刑编辑同志：
    平原省浚县司法科工作干部郭儒林，利用职权，贪赃枉法，严重地损害了人民政府在群众中的威信。经最高人民法院复判，该犯已在浚县被枪决。
    郭儒林，曾在日伪军中充当职员六年，于一九四一年混入革命阵营，一九四九年七月被调至浚县司法科工作。郭犯混入人民政府后，一贯违法乱纪，贪污受贿。仅据一九四六年至一九五○年的统计，郭犯即犯法二十六次。如该县二区申湾村富农申开城，在土地改革中违犯政府法纪，被判处徒刑二年，郭竟贪取二十万元的贿赂，允许申开城取保外押。该县六区反革命犯和聚才已被逮捕，郭犯受贿三十万元，竟将其释放了。郭犯贪赃枉法的罪恶行为，严重地影响了人民政府在群众中的威信。
    上述事实经该县领导干部发觉后，即派员侦察，随即将郭犯逮捕。平原省人民法院得报，组织了调查小组，赶往浚县就审，依法判处郭犯死刑。郭犯不服，上诉最高人民法院。七月十一日，最高人民法院批准原判，平原省人民法院遵判指令浚县人民政府执行。八月十三日，浚县人民政府召开三千余人的群众大会，当场将该犯执行枪决。郭犯所有贪赃枉法，敲诈群众资财的案件，都依法重新处理了。
                    平原省浚县人民政府李炳源贪图个人享受贪污国家财产
    交城县长张进才等被撤职
    法办编辑同志：
    山西省交城县县长张进才等营私舞弊，严重损失了国家财产，已受到了应得的惩处。交城县人民政府曾于一九四九年冬开设木厂一座，赚了十余万斤小米。一九五○年四月，山西省人民政府财委会指令交城人民政府将该木厂全部移交省林业局管理。张进才曾屡抗不交，并私令财粮科科长马继信等捏造账目，隐瞒国家财产达小米七万三千余斤，并冒领运费三万六千余斤。木厂移交后，张进才藉口机关经费困难，一再向汾阳专署要求予以补助。该专署未经调查，即向省财委会请示办法。林业局发觉了这个问题，曾向省财委会提出意见。但省财委会并未采纳林业局的意见，还是决定拨给该县补助费计小米十五万斤。之后，汾阳专署发觉了真实情况，曾数次督促交城县府具实上报，但张进才仅报出银行存款五千万元，而隐瞒了现存的三百余匹洋布。张进才为了追求个人的享受，任意挥霍国家财产，仅购买衣服和其他日用品一项，即用去公家小米三千余斤。
    为了掩护自己的罪行，张进才曾拨出大批公款，贿赂县区干部。交城县的财政情况因此陷于极端混乱，一部分不正派的干部都乘机乱支乱借，从无人敢提出批评。
    山西省人民监察委员会发觉了上述情况，即分别给予当事者应得的处分：除如数追还张进才等贪污的公家财产外，并予以撤职处分，送法院法办。其他有关干部，都按照情节轻重，予以记过，批评等处分。
                        徐步远  王周西李东林等盗卖国家药材
    分别受到法律制裁编辑同志：
    西北军区后勤卫生部材料处干部李东林、荣蕴青等盗卖国家药材、书籍等物品，使国家财产受到严重损失，西安市人民法院已分别予以惩处。
    一九五○年二月，李东林、荣蕴青等盗卖该材料处氨基磺胺（消炎粉）一箱（六千克）李、荣二人议定由马兆芳（当时在该处的工作人员）勾结私商高某转售。为了及早将全部药材运出，李东林又先后与在该处工作的刘福祥、贺耀祖、吴振南、李来厚、冯士岐等人共谋，由他们帮助运输，并议定“如果被别人发觉，谁也不能说谁”。此后，又分别与红十字会医院党文杰、商人赵文轩、雷宝善等相互勾结，继续偷盗公家药品。除集体盗卖外，各犯并个别进行偷盗药材、书籍及其他公共物品。总计被盗药品三十五种，书籍七十一册，其他物品二十一件，使国家财产损失很大。
    为了严肃法纪，教育全体干部，除将马兆芳交中共中央西北局纪律检查委员会处理外，西北人民监察委员会予李东林、荣蕴青、刘福祥、吴振南等以撤职处分。西安市人民法院并依法判处李东林、荣蕴青有期徒刑各七年，刘福祥有期徒刑五年，吴振南二年，马兆芳一年又六个月。贺耀祖因自动坦白罪状，有助于该案的破获，事后又作了比较深刻的检讨，从宽处理，着记大过一次。
