    The Shameful Act of the Mexican Government
    On the morning of the 9th of this month, the police authorities of the reactionary Mexican government illegally arrested the Secretary of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, Hall, in the capital of Mexico, and then immediately extradited him to the American police authorities. He has been imprisoned in the federal prison in Texarkana City, USA.
    American Communist leader Hall was forced to flee to Mexico due to fascist persecution by the American government, but the FBI, an American special agent, arrested him through the Mexican police authorities. This fact fully exposes that the reactionary government of Mexico has become so despicable and vile that it has completely become a running dog of American imperialism and a branch of the American special service agency.
    This despicable act of the Mexican government shamefully sold out the country's sovereignty and independence, which has aroused great anger from the Mexican people and is despised by upright people all over the world.
    On the other hand, this fact also shows the arrogance and brutality of the American government, which extended its fascist police power to the capitals of other countries and continued to persecute the American Communist leader who was seeking asylum. However, the arrest of American Communist leader Hall in Mexico will not only affect the American people's struggle for peace and democracy under the leadership of the American Communist Party, but also arouse greater anger from the American and Mexican people, strengthening their determination for a common struggle.

    墨西哥政府的可耻行为
    本月九日清晨，墨西哥反动政府的警察当局，在墨西哥首都非法逮捕了美国共产党全国委员会书记霍尔，然后立即引渡给美国警察当局，并已被监禁在美国得克萨堪纳城的联邦监狱中。
    美共领袖霍尔是受了美国政府的法西斯迫害而出亡到墨西哥的，而美国特务机关联邦调查局竟借墨西哥警察当局之手加以逮捕。这一事实，充分暴露了墨西哥的反动政府已经卑劣下流到了如此地步，以至完全成为美国帝国主义的走狗、美国特务机关的一个分支机构。
    墨西哥政府的这种卑鄙行为，可耻地出卖了国家的主权和独立，因而已引起墨西哥人民的极大愤怒，并为世界正直的人士所不齿。
    另一方面，这一事实也说明了美国政府的蛮横与狂暴，竟将它的法西斯警察权力伸到别的国家的首都，对避难中的美共领袖继续加以迫害。但是美共领袖霍尔在墨西哥的被捕，不但丝毫不能影响美国人民在美国共产党领导下争取和平民主的斗争，而且激起了美国与墨西哥人民的更大愤怒，使他们加强了共同斗争的决心。
