Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

    On September 4th, the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column published a letter from Comrade Zhang Boming of Taiyuan, pointing out that the comic book "Golden Earring" published by our bookstore distorted the position of the People's Liberation Army and erroneously depicted the PLA's discipline and the relationship between the army and the people. This opinion is very correct. We sincerely accept this criticism and have stopped selling all copies of "Golden Earring."

Self-Criticism of Qian Yufan, Compiler and Illustrator of "Golden Earring"

To the Editor:

    In March 1950, I adapted a short news report by Comrade Weiming called "Golden Earring" into a comic book. Before adapting it, I did not deeply study the original work, and I did not notice the errors during the drawing process. This was caused by my insufficient political understanding and a careless attitude towards creation. This kind of work, which confuses the enemy and ourselves and blurs class struggle, commits a principled error. In order to overcome the above errors, I have decided to work hard to improve my political understanding and take a serious attitude towards creation in the future. I offer my sincere thanks to Comrade Zhang Boming.

    Qian Yufan

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    上海华明书局和连环图画“金耳环”编绘者的检讨编辑同志：
    九月四日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了太原读者张伯明同志的一封信，指出本店出版的连环画
    “金耳环”歪曲了人民解放军的立场，错误地描写了人民解放军的军纪和军民关系。这个意见是非常正确的，我们诚恳地接受这一批评，并已把“金耳环”全部停售。
    上海华明书局陈福墉
    “金耳环”编绘者钱予凡的自我检讨编辑同志：
    本人在一九五○年三月间，采取微明同志一个短篇通讯“金耳环”的内容编绘成连环画。我在编绘前对原著并未深刻研究，在绘制过程中，也没有发觉错误。这是由于自己政治水平不够和创作上存在着轻率作风所造成的。这种敌我不分，模糊阶级斗争的作品，犯了原则性的错误。为了克服以上错误，我决定今后要努力提高政治水平并严肃创作态度。我对张伯明同志致诚挚的谢意。
    钱予凡
