The completion of the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project is a great achievement of the hard work of three million laborers and tens of thousands of engineers, technicians, and workers. At the end of the first phase of the project, all engineering personnel, workers, and laborers carefully checked their work, and 30,000 of them were selected as Huai River harnessing labor models or meritorious workers; they are outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland, people standing at the forefront of the Huai River harnessing front. With their labor enthusiasm and wisdom, they motivated others to complete the projects that would have taken several years to complete in eight months, miraculously relieving the disaster of 55 million people in the Huai River basin.

The achievements of these labor models and meritorious workers vary. They have contributed their labor, technology, and wisdom to the massive Huai River harnessing project in different work positions. Wu Meisheng, Deputy Chief Engineer of Wusong Machinery Factory, Xie Hongyou, Gan Caihua (female), Zhang Liaoju, Ma Fuqian, special-class Huai River harnessing labor models, Wang Shilan, special-class meritorious worker, Pan Fengyun, Wang Tingxiu, Ding Guangfu, Zheng Peiqi, labor models, Wang Changhui, railway worker, Huang Yuanming (female), model engineer, and Liu Huaicun, working cadre, who came to Beijing to observe the National Day ceremony, are representatives of these 30,000 models and meritorious workers. Over the past year, model figures have continued to emerge in every work position, every construction site, and every period of the Huai River harnessing project. For example, Ma Fuqian, who completed a month's project plan in thirteen days during the construction of the Shimantan Reservoir project, was selected as a special-class model from 1,444 labor models. Labor model Wang Tingxiu has been selected as a labor model four times since the Huai River harnessing began. These models and meritorious workers, including model cadres, model engineers, model workers, and tens of thousands of model laborers, are always the first to bear hardships and take the lead in their work. In order to repair the Huai River, they overcame many difficulties in the project with their selfless work and labor spirit.

People's Engineer Wu Meisheng

The Runheji Sluice Gate is the newest type of hydraulic opening and closing gate in our country, with each hole 45 meters wide. In the past, sluice gates in our country were generally old-fashioned insert plates or lifting types using simple machinery, with each hole generally no more than ten meters wide. Such gates had to be manufactured and installed by foreign factories. Today, with the help of Soviet experts, we have solved the entire manufacturing and installation of this new type of gate with our own technology and strength. People's engineer Wu Meisheng made outstanding contributions to the manufacture of various complex parts of this gate. Wu Meisheng is 57 years old this year. He is the deputy chief engineer of the Shanghai Wusong Machinery Factory and an old worker with more than 40 years of work experience. When he first received the task of rushing to manufacture the parts on the gate, he was a little hesitant. However, Chairman Mao's call and patriotic enthusiasm inspired him. He bravely accepted this task, and with his 40 years of work experience, he worked with the workers to manufacture 50 oil pressure cylinders that fully met the standard specifications and personally rushed to Runheji in northern Anhui to supervise the installation of the entire gate.

When rushing to manufacture the oil pressure cylinders, in order to ensure the completion of the task on schedule, engineer Wu Meisheng worked overtime with the workers like everyone else and put forward many rationalization proposals in his work. These suggestions not only ensured that the parts met the standards, but also saved the country a lot of materials. For example, when manufacturing oil cylinders, he suggested adding the work procedure of internal grinding of the oil cylinder, thus ensuring the reliability of the parts; he suggested drilling a hole in the safety tongue (that is, the safety valve), thus ensuring the safety of the gate. For the large copper gasket of the oil cylinder, he suggested changing to a three-tenths thick and six-inch wide copper skin to be welded together, and then cut with a lathe, thus greatly saving materials. He personally supervised the manufacture of each oil pressure cylinder, working day and night with the workers.

After the parts were manufactured, engineer Wu Meisheng rushed to the Runheji Sluice Gate construction site to be responsible for the installation work. This work was a completely new, difficult and complicated work for him and all the engineers in China. There were many difficulties in the work; but all the difficulties were overcome under his careful operation. For example, when installing the gate bearing seat, because the parts were too heavy and the lifting line was difficult, he proposed welding four shims on the anchor bolts, which resulted in a five-fold acceleration of the bearing seat installation work. In order to ensure that the dam could release water on schedule, the old engineer worked continuously for more than 30 hours without sleeping all night.

People's engineer Wu Meisheng has dedicated his whole heart and soul to the great construction cause.

Model of Models

The three million laborers active on the thousand-mile Huai River line are the basic force for carrying out the Huai River harnessing work. Most of them are farmers living on both sides of the Huai River who have suffered from the Huai River floods and are particularly eager to harness the Huai River. From last winter to this spring, they came to the construction site again and again and enthusiastically participated in the work. Among them, many model figures emerge every day, every hour, and everywhere. Xie Hongyou is their representative and the model of the laborers.

Xie Hongyou is a special-class Huai River harnessing model. Before being elected as a special-class Huai River harnessing model, he had been elected as a model four times. He is not only hardworking himself, but more importantly, he leads the laborers with a plan and method, and each time he can successfully complete the tasks assigned to him by the leadership, and do the work quickly and well. He is a squad leader of a labor team, and their team specializes in ramming. His squad rams high and firmly, and has won the red flag three times in a row. When they were changed to a soil carrying team, their performance in carrying soil was still higher than other teams, averaging more than 4.5 cubic meters of soil per person per day, breaking the highest record of the entire labor team. In any work, Xie Hongyou always takes the lead in hard work. When digging the diversion canal, he was the first to stand in the silt to dig, and the skin on his legs cracked into many bloody wounds, but he still gritted his teeth and continued. He was sick, but when he heard that there was a spring gushing water when digging the diversion canal, he immediately went to the construction site with his illness to help block it. His hard work spirit moved the entire team of laborers. Later, his labor squad was changed to a commando team, and the work enthusiasm of the entire team was even higher. They can complete every commando task on time or ahead of schedule. One day at 9:00 p.m., the engineering leaders asked their entire squad to repair the slope of the dam fixing the river channel before 12:00 that night. Everyone was already very tired at the time. In order to complete this urgent task, Xie Hongyou did not spare any effort and immediately took the lead, and finally completed the repair with only five minutes to twelve o'clock, and it fully met the engineering standards.

Xie Hongyou is a farmer from Huoqiu County in northern Anhui and a hired peasant who has suffered all kinds of hardships. He loves the motherland. He often says: "The volunteers are bleeding in the front, suffering all kinds of hardships, what is it for us to suffer this little bit of hardship!" Because of the different nature of the commando team's work, when there is a commando task, they often work in groups of ten or groups of five. Xie Hongyou divided the squad into groups of three and large groups of ten, and cultivated activists in each group to ensure the efficiency of decentralized work. Therefore, his squad's work performance has always been very good. After Xie Hongyou's experience in leading the squad was promoted in the labor team, the labor efficiency of many labor teams was improved.

Railway Worker Wang Changhui

Tens of thousands of transportation workers are busy day and night transporting the materials and equipment for the Huai River harnessing project, and have made great contributions to the great Huai River harnessing project. Railway worker Wang Changhui is their representative.

More than 200,000 tons of materials and equipment for the construction of the Runheji Sluice Gate were completed by the light railway surrounding the construction site. Wang Changhui was one of the six railway workers who laid this 20-kilometer light railway. He was originally a worker in the Jiulonggang Works Section of the Huainan Railway. Under normal circumstances, laying this section of railway would require at least several hundred workers, but at that time the task was urgent and there were not enough workers. Wang Changhui and the other six bravely accepted this task. They only selected more than 30 laymen from the laborers as assistants. Six people plus 30 laymen completed the task on schedule without delaying the Runheji Sluice Gate project.

It is not easy to teach farmers who have never seen a train how to repair railways in a short period of time. Wang Changhui and the others built and patiently taught the farmers piece by piece, working day and night. Finally, they taught the laborers, and the railway was built. In his work, Wang Changhui was very concerned about the lives of the laborers and took the opportunity to publicize the principles of the worker-peasant alliance to the laborers.

On the Huai River construction site, millions of laborers were all moved when they saw the selfless labor of the workers participating in the Huai River harnessing project and Wang Changhui's brotherly help to them. They further recognized the workers' older brothers and the great power of the worker-peasant alliance in the Huai River harnessing project.

    站在治淮战线最前列的人
    新华社记者  冒茀君  李人怡
    根治淮河第一期工程完成，是三百万民工和成千上万的工程师、技术人员和工人辛勤劳作的伟大成果。在第一期工程结束的时候，全体工程人员、工人和民工仔细地检查了一下自己的工作，其中三万人被评选为治淮劳动模范或功臣；他们是祖国的优秀儿女，是站在治淮战线最前列的人。他们以自己的劳动热情和智慧，带动其他的人，在八个月内奇迹似地完成了以往需要几年才能完成的工程，解救了淮河流域五千五百万人民的灾难。
    这些劳动模范们和功臣们的业绩各不相同，他们在不同的工作岗位上，为巨大的治淮工程贡献了自己的劳力、技术和智慧。这次国庆节来北京观礼的吴淞机器厂副总工程师吴梅生，特等治淮劳动模范谢洪友、甘彩华（女）、张辽巨、马福乾，特等功臣王世兰，劳动模范潘凤云、王庭秀、丁广富、郑培起，铁路工人王长惠，模范工程师黄远明（女）以及工作干部刘怀存等，正是这三万模范和功臣的代表。一年来，在治淮的每一个工作岗位上、每一个工地、每一段时期，都不断有模范人物出现。例如在修建石漫滩水库工程中，十三天内完成一个月工程计划的马福乾，就是从一千四百四十四个劳动模范中选出的特等模范。劳动模范王庭秀从治淮开始到现在，曾经四次被选为劳动模范。这些模范和功臣们，包括模范干部、模范工程师、模范工人和成千成万的模范民工，他们在工作中都是吃苦在先，带头工作。他们为了要把淮河修好，以忘我的工作和劳动精神，克服了工程中很多困难。
    人民工程师吴梅生
    润河集分水闸闸门是我国最新形式的液压启闭式的闸门，每孔宽四十五公尺。过去我国水闸闸门一般是古老的插板式或利用简单机械的升降式，每孔宽度一般不超过十公尺。这样的闸门也都要外国工厂才能制造和安装。今天，我们在苏联专家的帮助下，以自己的技术，自己的力量，解决了这个新式闸门全部的制造和安装问题。在制造这个闸门的各种复杂的机件中，人民工程师吴梅生有卓越的贡献。吴梅生今年五十七岁，是上海吴淞机器制造厂的副总工程师，也是一个已经有四十多年工龄的老工人。当他开始接到赶制闸门上的机件的任务时，他还有些犹豫。但是，毛主席的号召、爱国的热情鼓舞了他，他勇敢地接受了这个任务，用他四十多年的工作经验，和工人在一起，制造出了五十只完全合乎标准规格的油压筒，并亲自赶到皖北润河集监督整个闸门的安装工作。
    在赶造油压筒时，为了保证按期完成任务，吴梅生工程师和工人一样地连续加班突击，并在工作中提出许多合理化建议。这些建议，不仅保证了机件合乎标准，并且为国家节省了很多器材。例如制造油缸时，他建议增加油缸内径施磨的工作程序，因而保证了机件的可靠性；他建议保险舌门（即保险凡而）上加钻一个眼子，因而保证了闸门的安全。油缸的紫铜大垫圈，他建议改用三分厚六寸宽的紫铜皮圈起来焊接，再以车床割切，因而大大节省了器材。每一个油压筒他都要亲自督促制造，和工人在一起夜以继日地工作。
    机件制成后，吴梅生工程师赶到润河集分水闸工地上负责安装工作。这个工作对他、对全中国的工程师来讲都是一个全新的而又艰巨复杂的工作，工作中困难很多；但所有的困难都在他的精心操作下克服了。例如装闸门轴承座时，因机件过重，吊线困难，他就提出在地脚螺钉上焊四块垫铁，结果使轴承座安装工作加快了五倍。为了保证拦河闸能够如期放水，这位老工程师曾经通宵不睡，连续工作了三十多个小时。
    人民工程师吴梅生就是这样把他全身心贡献给了伟大的建设事业。
    模范的模范
    活跃在千里淮河线上的三百万民工，是进行治淮工作的基本队伍。他们之中绝大部分是住居在淮河两岸、身受过淮河水灾的农民，要求治好淮河特别迫切。从去冬到今春，他们一次、再一次地来到工地上，热情奋发地参加工作。他们中间，每天、每时、每地都有许许多多模范人物涌现出来。谢洪友就是他们的代表，是民工模范中的模范。
    谢洪友是特等治淮模范。在当选为特等治淮模范之前，他已经有四次当选为模范。他不仅自己工作刻苦，更重要的是他领导民工有计划、有办法，每次都能圆满地完成领导上交给他的任务，把工作作得又快又好。他是民工队的一个分队长，他们一队专负责打硪。他的分队打硪时抛得高，打得实，曾经连续三次得到红旗。当他们改为挑土队以后，挑土的成绩仍然高过别队，平均每人每天挑土四点五公方以上，打破全民工队的最高纪录。在任何工作中，谢洪友总是带头苦干。挖引河时，他自己首先站在淤泥里挖，腿上皮肤裂成许多血口子，他依然咬紧牙关干下去。他生了病，但一听说挖引河遇到泉眼冒水，立刻带病赶到工地帮助堵塞。他的苦干精神感动全队民工。后来，他的民工分队改为突击队，全队的工作情绪更高了。每一件突击任务他们都能按时或者提前完成。有一天夜晚九点钟，工程领导方面要他们全分队在当夜十二点以前将固定河槽拦河闸的坡修好。当时大家已经很累了，为了完成这个紧急任务，谢洪友不辞劳苦，立即带头就干，终于在还差五分到十二点的时候修成了，并且完全合乎工程标准。
  谢洪友是皖北霍邱县农民，是一个吃过千辛万苦的雇农。他热爱祖国，他常说：“志愿军在前方流血，吃尽千辛万苦，我们吃这点苦算什么呢！”突击队因为工作性质不同，一有突击任务时，往往十人一伙、五人一伙地分散干活。谢洪友就把分队分成三人一小组，十人一大组，在每个组中培养积极分子，来保证分散干活时的效率。因此，他的分队工作成绩始终很好。谢洪友领导分队的经验在民工队中推广以后，提高了好些民工队的劳动效率。
    铁路工人王长惠
    成千成万的运输工人，为赶运治淮的工料器材日夜奔忙，在伟大的治淮工程中建立了功勋。铁路工人王长惠，就是他们的代表。
    修建润河集分水闸的二十多万吨器材，是靠环绕在工地四周的轻便铁道完成的。王长惠是铺设这二十公里轻便铁道的六个铁路工人中的一个。他原是淮南铁路九龙岗工务段的工人。在一般情况下，铺设这段铁道至少需要几百工人，但是，那时候任务紧急，却没有足够的工人。王长惠等六个人勇敢地接受了这个任务，他们只从民工中挑选了三十多个外行人作助手。六个人加三十个外行人便如期完成了任务，没有耽误润河集分水闸的工程。
    要把从来没有见过火车的农民在短期内教会修铁道，是件多么不容易的事。王长惠他们一面修筑一面耐心地一件一件地教农民，夜以继日地劳动，终于，他们把民工教会了，铁路也修成了。工作中，王长惠非常关心民工的生活，一有机会还给民工宣传工农联盟的道理。
    在淮河工地上，千百万民工看见参加治淮的工人的忘我劳动，看见王长惠们对他们的兄弟般的帮助，无不感动。他们进一步认识了工人老大哥，认识了工农联盟在治淮工程中的伟大的力量。
