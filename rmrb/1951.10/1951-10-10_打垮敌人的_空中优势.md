    Shattering the Enemy's "Air Superiority"
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Guo Chuancai
    I am a gun commander in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in charge of one gun.

    Once, enemy planes dived down. Our entire company concentrated fire on the three planes over there. Cunningly, another enemy plane flew in from behind. The situation was very urgent; they wanted to bomb our positions and anti-aircraft guns from the rear.

    There was no time to ask the company commander for instructions. With the roaring of artillery fire, he couldn't hear me even if I shouted. I made up my mind and turned our fourth gun around.

    The enemy plane was diving at low altitude, about one thousand meters away.

    I rallied the comrades, saying, "The gun obeys commands! Ammunition must be accurate! Comrades! The opportunity to bring honor to Chairman Mao and the motherland has come!"

    The comrades all gritted their teeth and prepared calmly.

    The gunner said anxiously, "Gun commander, fire!"

    I said, "Comrades! We have three no-fires: no firing without certainty; no firing without accuracy; no firing without shooting it down. Let it fly closer before we fire!"

    At this time, the enemy plane was only seven or eight hundred meters away, meaning it was the time to be certain.

    I shouted, "Rapid fire!" After about twenty rounds were fired, the fuel tank next to the enemy plane's front wing caught fire.

    I shouted, "Increase firepower!" Aiming at the enemy plane's head, we fired another 110 rounds in rapid succession.

    An AF-80 enemy plane smoked and swayed from side to side, flying about four li before the fire blazed up. The pilot jumped to the ground!

    "The parachute is down!" the comrades shouted.

    Three reserve artillerymen ran over, with the reconnaissance platoon sent by the political instructor to coordinate with them.

    The enemy planes that hadn't been hit strafed and swept, preventing the comrades from approaching.

    Our guns turned around to assist, and the enemy planes dared not fly low. The sky was white with a large expanse of parachutes. As soon as they landed, they were captured alive by the comrades.

    After the enemy plane was shot down, the Korean people came out of the air raid shelters, jumping and cheering. Old mothers and children brought boiled water and apples.

    I don't believe the enemy's bragging about their "air superiority."

    Our artillerymen are brave. Even when bombs fall beside us and the noise is deafening, we still fire as usual. We ignore injuries and keep firing as long as we can move. Even one person will persist in firing.

    Of the five comrades in the third gun crew, four were injured. Gunner Zhang Tianrong had a hole through his right shoulder, and blood was flowing out. He said, "I don't need my right arm; my left arm can still fight!" He used his left arm to grab the steering gear and turned it all the way, firing more than forty shells and shooting down the enemy plane into the sea!

    To fight the American aggressors, we can be without food for three days and still be in high spirits. We are not afraid of carrying shells. A box weighs over a hundred jin, and we can carry a hundred boxes in one breath.

    This gun of ours, with the coordination of friendly artillery fire, also shot down one AF-51 and one B-29 bomber.

    The whole division selected me as a "High-Altitude Hero," and the comrades shouted that they would learn from me! The Korean government awarded me a Warrior Medal.

    I was originally a peasant youth from a poor peasant family, twenty-one years old this year. That I can be who I am today is entirely due to the cultivation of the great Chinese Communist Party!

    This time, returning to the motherland, I saw that the industrial construction of the motherland is very different from when we went abroad, which has further increased our love for the motherland and also increased our hatred for the enemy!

    打垮敌人的“空中优势”
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  郭传才
    我是人民志愿军某部一个炮车长，指挥一门炮。
    有一次敌机俯冲下来了，我们全连集中火力，正打那边的三架，狡猾的敌机，又从背后飞来了一架，情况很紧急，他们想从背后来炸坏我们的阵地和高射炮。
    来不及向连长请示了，炮火轰轰响，喊他也听不见，我便下了决心，调转了我们的第四炮。
    敌机低空俯冲，距离一千多公尺。
    我向同志们动员说：“炮听指挥！弹药测准！同志们！为毛主席和祖国增光的机会来到了！”
    同志们都咬紧牙根，沉着地准备着。
    炮手急的说：“炮车长，打吧！”
    我说：“同志们！我们有三不打：没有把握不打；打不准不打；打不落不打，让它飞近再打！”
    这时候，敌机距离只有七八百公尺了，就是说到了有把握的时候。
    我喊：“连射！”炮发二十发左右，敌机前翅膀身旁的油箱着了。
    我喊：“提高火力！”对着敌机脑袋，又连发一百一十发。
    一架AF八○式敌机呜呜地冒烟，左右摇摆着，飞出去有四里地火就烧大啦，驾驶员就向地下跳了！
    “降落伞下来了！”同志们都喊。
    三个后备的炮兵跑去，连指导员派了侦察班配合他们。
    没有打着的敌机，俯冲扫射，打得同志们不能接近。
    我们的炮又调转来配合，敌机不敢低飞了。空中白花花，好一大片降落伞。等他们一落地，就被同志们活捉啦。
    击落了敌机，朝鲜人民都从防空洞出来，跳着欢呼。老妈妈、小孩子就给送来开水、苹果。
    敌人吹牛皮说的他们的“空中优势”，我是不相信的。
    我们的炮兵是勇敢的，炸弹在身旁落，声音乱响，我们还是照常打，挂花不管，能动弹就打，有一个人也坚持着打。
    第三炮五个同志，四个同志负伤，一炮手张天荣同志右肩穿一个洞，血直往外流，他说：“右胳膊不要，左胳膊也能作战！”他就用左胳膊抓住方向转动机打到底，打了四十多发炮弹，把敌机打落到海里！
    我们为了跟美国侵略者作战，三天不吃饭，情绪同样高涨；扛炮弹不怕累，一箱重百十来斤，一口气就连扛百十箱。
    我们这架炮，在友邻的炮火配合下，还击落了A F五一式一架和B二九轰炸机一架。
    全师选我作“高射英雄”，同志们都喊着要向我来看齐！我被朝鲜政府奖给了一枚勇士勋章。
    我本来是贫农出身的一个农民青年，今年二十一岁，能有今天，完全是伟大的中国共产党培养出来的！
    这次回到祖国来，看见了祖国的工业建设，比我们出国时候大不相同了，更增加了我们对祖国的热爱，也更增加了对敌人的仇恨！
