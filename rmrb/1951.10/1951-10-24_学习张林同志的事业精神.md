    Learning from Comrade Zhang Lin's Dedication to the Cause
    Editor's Note: After the publication of the article "I Give My Whole Life to the Party" in the "Party Life" column of this newspaper on October 3rd, we have successively received many letters from readers, all of whom expressed their desire to learn from Comrade Zhang Lin's noble qualities. Excerpts are published below:
      Persist in Revolutionary Work to the End
    After our entire group of ten people read the article "I Give My Whole Life to the Party," we all expressed our determination in this way: "We must do the Party's work well, we must persist in revolutionary work to the end, until the realization of communism."
                  A unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Liang Xiankun
        Dedicate My Whole Life to Revolutionary Literary and Artistic Work
    After reading the article "I Give My Whole Life to the Party," I felt very ashamed. In the past, I was not at ease with the literary and artistic work in the army, so I did not study my work well. Now I am determined to dedicate my whole life to revolutionary literary and artistic work.
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army Soldier Tang Jingmei
      I Know That I Should Honestly Work for the People
  I am an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background who has just joined revolutionary work. As long as the work is slightly unsatisfactory, I feel unhappy, or when I encounter difficulties, I want to change jobs. It was not until I read the article "I Give My Whole Life to the Party" that I realized this was wrong. I realized that I should honestly work for the people. Only in this way can I get real happiness, and the difficulties in the work can be overcome.

    学习张林同志的事业精神
    编者按：本报十月三日“党的生活”栏发表了“我把整个生命交给了党”一文后，陆续接到很多读者来信，他们都表示要学习张林同志的高贵品质。现摘要发表如下：
      把革命工作坚持到底
    当我们全组十个人读了“我把整个生命交给了党”一文后，都这样表示自己的决心：“一定要把党的工作做好，一定要把革命工作坚持到底，直到实现共产主义。”
                  中国人民解放军某部  梁贤鹍
        把整个生命贡献给革命的文艺工作
    读了“我把整个生命交给了党”一文以后，我感到非常惭愧。过去我不安心部队文艺工作，也就没有很好去钻研自己的工作。现在我下决心把整个生命贡献给革命的文艺工作。
    中国人民志愿军战士  唐靖妹
      我知道了应老实地为人民工作
  我是一个刚刚参加革命工作的小资产阶级出身的知识分子，只要工作稍不如意，心里就不痛快，或者遇到困难时，就想换换工作岗位。直到我读了“我把整个生命交给了党”这篇文章后，才认识这是错误的。我认识了自己应该老实地为人民工作。只有这样，才能得到真正的愉快，工作中的困难，也才能够克服。
    读者  苏  尚
