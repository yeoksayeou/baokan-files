To the Editor:

    Li Jinquan, a welding worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and a labor model, has continued to improve the quality of soft steel welding rods since he successfully made them last year. To date, he has improved them four times. According to test results, the quality of the improved soft steel welding rods surpasses that of imported products in terms of cold working, hot working, tensile strength, torsion, and bending. In terms of cost, by making the most of waste materials when preparing the welding flux, the price has gradually been reduced to one-seventh of the current market price of imported goods. Li Jinquan said, "This self-made, high-quality, low-priced welding rod is a small contribution I have made to the motherland under the leadership and help of the Party."

    劳动模范李金泉继续改进软钢焊条质量编辑同志：
    石景山钢铁厂电焊工人、劳动模范李金泉，自去年自制软钢焊条成功后，继续改进软钢焊条的质量。至目前止，先后改进了四次。根据试验结果，改进后的软钢焊条的质量，无论在冷作、热作、拉力、扭力、弯曲等方面，都超过了进口货。在成本方面，由于配制焊药时尽量利用废料，其价格竟逐渐减低到进口货现售市价的七分之一。李金泉说：“这种自制的质好价廉的焊条，是我在党的领导和帮助下，对祖国的一点小贡献。”
