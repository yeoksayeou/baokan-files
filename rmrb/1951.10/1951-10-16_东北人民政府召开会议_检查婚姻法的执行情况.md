Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: The Northeast People's Government convened a meeting on September 22nd to inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law and to discuss how to continue its implementation in the future. The meeting was presided over by Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government.

At the meeting, Song Guangchang, Deputy Minister of Justice, gave a brief report on the implementation of the Marriage Law in the Northeast. He pointed out that since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, it has been warmly supported by the broad masses of the people, especially women, in the Northeast. Many young men and women have willingly become partners. The conditions for their love are mainly good work, good study, and progressive thinking, and no longer based on the amount of property. These voluntary and independent newly married couples live happily, and their performance in politics and production is very active. However, due to the long history of the feudal marriage system, coupled with insufficient publicity of the Marriage Law, the remnants of feudal ideas about marriage still seriously hinder the growth of the new marriage system. There have even been many cases of women being killed or forced to commit suicide due to marriage problems. According to incomplete statistics, from May 1st of last year to the end of July this year, there were 514 casualties in the Northeast due to marriage problems, the vast majority of whom were women.

Representatives from the Northeast People's Government Supervision Committee, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Northeast Women's Federation, the Northeast Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region successively expressed their opinions. Finally, Vice Chairman Lin Feng made a concluding speech. Vice Chairman Lin Feng pointed out that in order to implement the Marriage Law, it is necessary to continue to carry out extensive publicity and education work among the people, publicize the positive role of the Marriage Law, commend and encourage new marital relationships, and at the same time criticize and struggle against phenomena that violate the Marriage Law. People's governments at all levels and people's organizations at all levels should conduct a check on the implementation of the Marriage Law in the near future. In this winter's training of district and village cadres, how to implement the Marriage Law should be included as one of the educational contents, and the Marriage Law should be publicized to the masses through winter schools. The marriage registration system should be improved, and education should be carried out through registration. The judicial department should check the implementation of the Marriage Law, and those who violate the Marriage Law should be dealt with appropriately according to the circumstances. Vice Chairman Lin also pointed out that while publicizing the Marriage Law, women should be educated to actively participate in production and construction, and strive to study to improve their cultural and political level, so as to improve the social status of women. The broad masses of young men and women should also be educated to adopt a serious and cautious attitude towards marriage issues, and resolutely oppose a frivolous attitude.

Finally, Vice Chairman Lin pointed out regarding the divorce issue of spouses of active-duty revolutionary soldiers: the provisions of Article 19 of the Marriage Law should be implemented cautiously and resolutely. Regarding the marriage issues of cadres, cadres should be educated to establish correct views on marriage.

    东北人民政府召开会议
    检查婚姻法的执行情况
    【新华社十五日讯】东北人民政府在九月二十二日召开会议，检查婚姻法执行情况和讨论今后如何继续贯彻问题。会议由东北人民政府副主席林枫主持。
    会上，司法部副部长宋广常简要报告了东北执行婚姻法的情况。他指出：自婚姻法公布后，在东北已获得广大人民特别是妇女的热烈拥护。许多男女青年都两相情愿地结成伴侣。他们恋爱的条件主要是工作好、学习好、思想进步，再不以财产多寡为条件了。这些自愿自主的新婚夫妇，生活美满，政治上、生产上表现都很积极。但是由于封建婚姻制度有着长期的历史，加以婚姻法的宣传还作得不够，关于婚姻问题的封建思想残余还严重地阻碍着新的婚姻制度的成长，甚至有不少妇女因婚姻问题被杀或被迫自杀。据不完全统计，东北自去年五月一日到今年七月末，因婚姻问题而伤亡者有五百十四人，其中绝大多数是妇女。
    东北人民政府人民监察委员会、民政部、东北妇联、青年团东北委员会和东北军区政治部代表先后发表了意见，最后由林枫副主席作总结发言。林枫副主席指出：为了贯彻婚姻法，必须继续向人民群众进行广泛的宣传教育工作，宣传婚姻法的积极作用，表扬与鼓励新的婚姻关系，同时对违反婚姻法的现象进行批判和斗争。各级人民政府与各级人民团体对于婚姻法执行情形应于最近进行一次检查。在今年冬季区村干部训练中，应把如何贯彻婚姻法作为教育内容之一，并应利用冬学向群众宣传婚姻法。婚姻登记制度应健全起来，通过登记进行教育。司法部门应检查婚姻法执行的情况，对违反婚姻法的分子应分别情况予以适当处理。林副主席并指出：在宣传婚姻法的同时，应教育妇女群众积极参加生产建设，努力学习提高文化和政治水平，以提高妇女社会地位，并应该教育广大青年男女，对婚姻问题要采取严肃的慎重的态度，坚决反对轻率态度。
    最后林副主席对现役革命军人配偶的离婚问题指出：应该慎重坚决地执行婚姻法第十九条之规定。对干部婚姻问题，应该教育干部建立正确的婚姻观点。
