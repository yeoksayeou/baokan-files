Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 12th: The German Democratic Republic People's Assembly's proposal to convene an all-German conference to hold all-German elections has been widely welcomed by the people of West Germany.

In the industrial heartland of West Germany—the Ruhr area and many cities and rural areas in North Rhine-Westphalia—mass meetings supporting the People's Assembly's proposal have been held. At rallies held in cities such as Hagen, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, Wanne-Eickel, and Cologne, thousands of people unanimously protested against the Bonn government's attempt to evade answering the People's Assembly's proposal, and stated that they would make every effort to realize this proposal. Representatives of people from all walks of life in West Germany, such as the famous doctor Radi from Dusseldorf, the pastor Oberhof from Bremen, the writer Ms. Christa Thomas, the Master of Theology Haumann, and the Communist Party member of the North Rhine-Westphalia state assembly, Ledwin, spoke at these meetings.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 14th: According to the German News Agency, representatives of the Central Committee of the People's Vote in West Germany and representatives of committees from various states, regions, and enterprises recently held a special meeting in Dusseldorf to discuss the new proposal made by the German Democratic Republic People's Assembly to the Bonn Federal Assembly on October 10th. A call was passed at the meeting, demanding that members of the Bonn Federal Assembly not betray the trust of the voters and immediately convene an all-German conference.
