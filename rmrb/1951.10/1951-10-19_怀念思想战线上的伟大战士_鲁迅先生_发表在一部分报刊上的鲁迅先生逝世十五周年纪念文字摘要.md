In memory of the great warrior on the ideological front – Mr. Lu Xun
——Excerpts of memorial articles on the 15th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death published in some newspapers and periodicals

On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, many magazines and newspapers across the country published memorial articles, expressing great respect for the life's work and struggle of this great Chinese writer, thinker, and warrior. They also provided more extensive elucidations than in the past on his many outstanding contributions in the fields of culture and art, as well as on his revolutionary thought and fighting spirit.

Feng Xuefeng's memoir "Recalling Lu Xun" (published in "New Observer" from Volume 3, Issue 1, and not yet completed) and the newly published "An Outline of Lu Xun's Life and the Development of His Thought" ("Literary Gazette" Volume 4, Issues 11 and 12 combined) provide a relatively detailed account of the development of Lu Xun's thought. Before 1927, Lu Xun's thought was based on Darwin's theory of evolution, which was a materialistic ideology. However, the theory of evolution was only the theoretical foundation of Lu Xun's materialism; the more important realistic foundation of his materialism was the revolutionary demands and struggles of Chinese society and the Chinese people. The value of Lu Xun's early thought lies precisely in its reflection of the revolutionary demands and fighting will of the Chinese people, reflecting the history of revolutionary struggle and the realistic problems of the revolution. He opposed imperialism, feudalism, and all reactionary forces. His struggle was fierce, resolute, and correct. His thought during this period was mainly petty-bourgeois revolutionary thought, which was essentially different from Marxism-Leninism. However, Marxists-Leninists still valued Mr. Lu Xun's early fighting career and the progressiveness and revolutionary nature of his thought, acknowledging his great contributions to the revolution and the enormous benefits of his thought to the people and humanity. Lu Xun's later thought had already become that of a Marxist-Leninist, a warrior and thinker standing on the position of the proletariat, a close comrade-in-arms of our Party, and a most heroic fighter under the leadership of our Party.

Lu Xun's literary and artistic thought is a very important part of the legacy of Chinese revolutionary literature and Marxist-Leninist literary theory. Chen Yong's "Several Important Aspects of Lu Xun's Literary and Artistic Thought" (published in "People's Literature" Volume 4, Issue 6) provides a brief discussion on this point. He pointed out that Lu Xun's literary and artistic thought was combative, constantly deepened, developed, and enriched in the struggle against various hostile literary and artistic thoughts. Lu Xun's "clear right and wrong, ardent love and hatred" was his principle in dealing with all issues, especially ideological issues. He deeply abhorred and ruthlessly attacked the feudal and so-called "nationalist literature" that served imperialism, as well as the reactionary literary and artistic thought of the bourgeoisie represented by Liang Shiqiu, which advocated "art for art's sake." He also waged a stern struggle against various erroneous petty-bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts.

From the perspective of ideological struggle within the revolution, Lu Xun's struggle against petty-bourgeois literary and artistic thought was of particular significance. Because China is a country with a large petty-bourgeois population, and most literary and artistic workers come from this class, its ideology also has a great influence in the literary and artistic field, even frequently invading the camp of proletarian literary and artistic thought. Therefore, opposing this ideology has become a regular and serious task of proletarian literary and artistic work. In his struggle against this literary and artistic thought, Lu Xun initially resolved many major fundamental issues in the Chinese literary and artistic struggle, such as the ideological transformation of literary and artistic workers, the relationship between literature and art and actual life and mass struggle, and the popularization of literature and art. Subsequently, these issues were clearly, thoroughly, and completely resolved in Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

In the early days of the Marxist literary movement, some revolutionary literary and artistic workers from petty-bourgeois backgrounds believed that it was extremely easy to become a proletarian writer and write proletarian works. They believed that it did not require any serious transformation, no transition in thought and feeling from one class to another, and no participation in actual revolutionary struggles. They thought that as long as one was "baptized by the spirit of the proletariat" overnight, everything would be ready, and they could become proletarian writers and create proletarian works. Lu Xun opposed this argument. He believed that to be a revolutionary writer, one must first be a true "revolutionary," and must "share life with the revolution, or deeply feel the pulse of the revolution" ("A Glimpse of Shanghai Literature and Art"). Lu Xun called those petty-bourgeois writers who suddenly transformed overnight "somersaulting petty-bourgeoisie." He believed that even if these people wrote about the revolution, they would most easily distort it. In 1930, when the proletarian literary ranks were just forming organizationally, that is, when the "Left League" was established, Lu Xun paid attention to educating young writers with proletarian thought, so that they would pay attention to maintaining the purity of the ranks in thought and first establish proletarian thought. He emphasized opposing the tendency of the petty-bourgeoisie to detach from reality, "not contacting actual social struggles, only writing articles and studying problems in glass windows," and "talking about socialism while sitting in the living room" ("Opinions on the League of Left-Wing Writers"); as well as opposing the tendency of writers to regard themselves as special. Lu Xun particularly emphasized that a writer should be familiar with life in many ways, familiar with all classes of society, and familiar with the enemy, ourselves, and our friends. He once criticized those writers and critics who did not study the enemy and knew nothing about the enemy, because without knowing the enemy, one cannot defeat the enemy.

Lu Xun also had profound insights on the issue of popularizing literature and art. He advocated that "there should be more writers who consider the masses," so that the masses can understand, love to read, and squeeze out some outdated works. He deeply understood the masses' appreciation habits and needs, and particularly emphasized the narrative quality of works. Regarding the use of old forms, he unified the use of old forms with the creation of new forms. He believed that "old forms are adopted, there must be deletions, and since there are deletions, there must be additions, and the result is the emergence of new forms, which is also a transformation" ("On the Adoption of Old Forms"). These have all been proven by today's practice.

Regarding Mr. Lu Xun's great contributions in editing and publishing work and his care and cultivation of young writers, Zang Kejia's "Mr. Lu Xun and Editing and Publishing Work" ("New Construction" Volume 5, Issue 1), and Wei Congwu's "Recalling Mr. Lu Xun" ("Literary New Land" Issue 8), and Yefu's "Disturbing Memories" (ibid.) provide some accounts. The energy and time Lu Xun devoted to editing and publishing work occupied a large proportion of his life. This is one of the components of his overall achievements in serving the people. On the one hand, he exposed those unscrupulous publishers who speculated for profit and those shameless people who both sought profit and fame, the "mercantile literary giants," and self-proclaimed "writers," and launched fierce attacks on literary and art books and periodicals containing reactionary toxins and crudely made, so that the thoughts of young people and the broad masses of readers were protected. On the other hand, he encouraged and supported good publishing houses or founded his own publishing houses to provide healthy and nutritious spiritual food for young people.

In addition, He Qifang's "Learning Mr. Lu Xun's Work Style" ("New Observer" Volume 3, Issue 6) and Lu Wanmei's "Remembering Mr. Lu Xun's 'Five Lectures in Beiping' Before and After", (Wang Yao's "Lu Xun and Beijing" (both seen in "Beijing Literature and Art" Volume 3, Issue 1), Chen Ruhui's "Mr. Lu Xun at Xiamen University", Wang Xiyan's "A Great Person" (both seen in "Literary Gazette" Volume 4, Issues 11 and 12), Feng Xuefeng's "Lu Xun with Children" ("Chinese Children" Issue 51), He Chuncai's "Bits and Pieces of Lu Xun's Life in Guangzhou", Xu Lun's "Lu Xun and Comrade Qu Qiubai", Liu Qian's "Lu Xun and His Teacher", Kawashima's "Mr. Lu Xun and Essays" and Feng Xuefeng's "Why Didn't Lu Xun Admit He Was a Genius?" (all seen in "Literary New Land" Issue 8), and other articles, all described in relatively detailed and affectionate ways Mr. Lu Xun's serious and meticulous, uncompromising work style, his examples of sharp struggles against representatives of various hostile forces, his love for young children, his love for comrades-in-arms, and his exemplary attitude towards people and things in adhering to principles.

Readers can see the face of this great warrior of the nation from these articles. (Comprehensive report by this newspaper)

    怀念思想战线上的伟大战士—鲁迅先生
    ——发表在一部分报刊上的鲁迅先生逝世十五周年纪念文字摘要
    在鲁迅先生逝世十五周年纪念之际，全国不少杂志和报纸都发表了纪念文字，对这位中国的伟大文学家、思想家和战士的一生战斗事业，表示了极大的敬意，对他的文化艺术方面的许多卓越贡献，以及对他的革命思想、战斗精神，作了比过去更多的阐明。
    冯雪峰所作的回忆录“回忆鲁迅”（“新观察”三卷一期起刊登，尚未刊完）和新发表的“鲁迅生平及他思想发展的梗概”（“文艺报”四卷十一、十二期合刊），比较周详地叙述了鲁迅思想的发展过程。在一九二七年以前，鲁迅的思想是以达尔文的进化论为基础的唯物论的思想。但进化论只是鲁迅的唯物论的理论基础，他的唯物论的更重要的现实的基础则是中国社会、中国人民的革命要求与斗争。鲁迅前期思想的价值，就正在于他反映了中国人民的革命要求与战斗意志，反映了革命斗争的历史与革命的现实问题。他反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对一切反动势力。他的战斗是猛烈的、坚决的、正确的。他这时期的思想，主要是小资产阶级的革命思想，与马克思列宁主义的思想有本质的不同。但马克思列宁主义者仍旧看重鲁迅先生前期那样的战斗事业及其思想的进步性和革命性，承认他的战斗对于革命的伟大功绩，和他的思想对于人民与人类的巨大利益。鲁迅后期的思想，已经成为一个马克思列宁主义者，是一个站在无产阶级立场上的战士和思想家，是我们党的一个亲密的战友，并且是在我们党的领导之下的一个最英勇的战士。
    鲁迅的文艺思想，是中国革命文学和马克思列宁主义的文学理论遗产中的一个十分重要的部分。关于这一点，在陈涌的“鲁迅文艺思想的几个重要方面”（刊“人民文学”四卷六期）一文中，作了一些扼要的论述。他指出，鲁迅的文艺思想是战斗的，是在和各种敌对的文艺思想的斗争中，不断深刻、发展和丰富起来的。鲁迅所说的“明确的是非，热烈的爱憎”，就是他对待一切问题，尤其对待思想问题的原则。他深恶痛绝地、无情地打击了封建的和为帝国主义服务的所谓“民族主义文学”，以及以梁实秋为代表的资产阶级“为艺术而艺术”的反动文艺思想，并且与各种错误的小资产阶级的文艺思想也进行了严正的斗争。
    从革命内部思想斗争的意义来看，鲁迅对小资产阶级的文艺思想进行斗争，是有着特殊意义的。因为中国是个小资产阶级人数众多的国家，文艺工作者又多是出身于这个阶级，它的思想在文艺领域内，影响也是很大的，甚至经常侵入无产阶级的文艺思想的阵营里。因此，反对这种思想便成为无产阶级文艺工作的一个经常的严重的任务。鲁迅在与这种文艺思想的斗争里，初步解决了中国文艺斗争中许多带根本性质的重大问题，如文艺工作者的思想改造问题，文艺与实际生活与群众斗争的关系问题，以及文艺的普及工作问题等。其后，这些问题都在毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，得到了明晰的、彻底的、完满的解决。
    在马克思主义文艺运动的初期，有些小资产阶级出身的革命文艺工作者认为，要成为一个无产阶级的作家和写出无产阶级的作品，是极其容易的事。不需要经过什么严重的改造，不需要经过思想、感情从一个阶级到另一个阶级的转变，不需要参加实际革命斗争，只要一朝一夕“受了无产阶级的精神洗礼”，便万事齐备，即能成为无产阶级的作家和创作出无产阶级的作品来了。鲁迅反对这种论调。他认为要想作一个革命作家，首先便要作一个真正的“革命人”，必须“和革命共同着生命，或深切地感受着革命的脉搏。”（“上海文艺之一瞥”）鲁迅称那些一夜突变过来的小资产阶级文学家为“翻筋斗的小资产阶级”。他认为这些人即是写革命，也最容易把革命写歪。在一九三○年无产阶级的文学队伍刚刚在组织上形成，即“左联”成立时，鲁迅便注意用无产阶级的思想教育年轻作家，使他们注意在思想上保持队伍的纯洁，首先建立无产阶级的思想。他着重反对了小资产阶级脱离实际“不和实际的社会斗争接触，单关在玻璃窗内做文章，研究问题”，“坐在客厅里谈社会主义”（“对于左翼作家联盟的意见”）的倾向；以及反对了作家自视特殊的倾向。鲁迅特别强调一个作家要多方面的熟悉生活，熟悉社会各阶级，熟悉敌、我、友。他曾经批评过那些不去研究敌人，对敌人无所知的作家和批评家，因为不知道敌人，是不能战胜敌人的。
    鲁迅在文艺大众化的问题上，也有深刻的见地。他主张“应该多有为大众设想的作家”，使大众能懂，爱看，挤掉一些陈腐的作品。他深刻了解群众的欣赏习惯和需要，特别强调作品的故事性。对于旧形式的利用上，他将旧形式的使用与新形式的创造统一起来。他认为“旧形式是采取，必有所删除，既有删除，必有所增益，这结果是新形式的出现，也就是变革。”（“论旧形式的采用”），这些都是被今天的实践所证明了的。
    关于鲁迅先生在编辑出版工作方面的伟大贡献和对于青年作家的爱护和培养，臧克家的“鲁迅先生与编辑出版工作”（“新建设”五卷一期），和韦丛芜的“回忆鲁迅先生”（“文艺新地”八期），野夫的“令人不安的回忆”（同上）的文章都作了一些记述。鲁迅在编辑出版方面付出的精力和时间，在他的一生中，占有很大的比重。这是他为人民服务的总的业绩中的组成部分之一。他一方面对专门投机牟利，乌七八糟的出版商人，以及一些既图利又图名的“商定文豪”，自封的“作家”的无耻之徒进行了揭露，并对含有反动毒素的、粗制滥造的文艺书刊，施行猛烈的攻击，使青年群众和广大读者的思想得到保卫；一方面鼓励与扶持好的出版社或自己创办出版社，把健康的、有滋养的精神食粮供应给青年。
    此外，何其芳的“学习鲁迅先生的工作作风”（“新观察”三卷六期）及陆万美的“追记鲁迅先生‘北平五讲’前后”、（王瑶的“鲁迅和北京”（以上见“北京文艺”三卷一期）、陈汝惠的“鲁迅先生在厦大”、王西彦的“一个伟大的人物”（以上见“文艺报”四卷十一、十二期合刊）、冯雪峰的“鲁迅跟少年儿童在一起”（“中国少年儿童”五十一期）、何春才的“鲁迅在广州的生活点滴”、徐仑的“鲁迅和瞿秋白同志”、柳倩的“鲁迅和他的先生”、川岛的“鲁迅先生和杂文”以及冯雪峰的“鲁迅为什么不承认他自己是天才？”（以上见“文艺新地”八期）等文，都比较详细地，亲切地叙述了鲁迅先生的认真严肃，丝毫不苟的工作作风，他对各种各色敌对势力的代表人物进行针锋相对的斗争的实例，他热爱青年儿童，热爱战友，以及他对人对事坚持原则等典范性的为人作事的态度。
    读者可以从这些文章中看到这个民族的伟大战士的面貌。（本报综合稿）
