By the Clear Zhang River
——A True Record of a Visit to the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Taihang Mountain
By our reporter Lin Wei

The banks of the Clear Zhang River in She County, Hebei Province, with their dense reeds, fruit trees, and even the women washing clothes and the children playing by the river, seem almost unchanged from the past. However, when we slow down and look carefully, we quickly discover many changes. The old sandy beaches have been transformed into large expanses of paddy fields, growing full ears of rice. In the green crops, large patches of cotton have been newly added, bearing plump cotton bolls. On the hillsides and roadsides, many small walnut trees, persimmon trees, and willow trees have been newly planted. In the villages, many houses destroyed by Japanese bandits have been repaired and turned into new homes. By the river and canals, many of the clothes washed by the women are no longer homespun cloth, but store-bought cloth. Even the homespun cloth is rarely variegated or patched all over. Generally speaking, they are new or relatively new clothes. A farmer from Wangbao Village pointed to the water mill not far to the south and told me: the flour ground at the water mill is no longer black, but yellow. The reason is that in the past, the people who brought grain to be ground would mix three to five dou of bran with one dou of corn, but now they only mix about one dou of bran with one dou of corn. In terms of weight, the bran only accounts for about a quarter. This kind of flour mixed with bran used to be eaten for breakfast and dinner, and even lunch, but now it is only eaten for breakfast. The other two meals are all millet or white flour and bean flour. (Note: Farmers in Shanxi eat grain flour in the morning, which is actually the same as millet mixed with bran.) For the same reason, in recent years, no one has set out “black dumplings” on the square after the autumn harvest (“black dumplings” are small bran balls made of persimmons mixed with bran flour. Every year after the autumn harvest, farmers would line up rows and rows of bran balls on their own fields, dry them, and eat them as grain).

In Chi'an and Yantou villages, we visited several farmers and village cadres. Chi'an was where the Taihang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the headquarters of the Taihang Military Region had long resided. I also lived here for a period. During the famine of 1943, Li Xuefeng, the secretary of the District Committee, Li Da, the commander of the Military Region, and other leading comrades ate "square bricks" (thick black bean cakes, cut into squares, looking very much like bricks), chewed pepper leaves, and led the office cadres and service personnel to grow radishes and tomatoes themselves, and to produce and survive the famine alongside the people who were eating bran and swallowing vegetables, leading the people to wage a resolute struggle against the Japanese invading army. Now, the wounds of war have gradually healed, and the people are enthusiastically developing production. All of the one hundred and thirty-five houses burned down by the Japanese army during the war have now been repaired, and more than thirty new ones have been built. My landlord, Zhang Laifu, used to live in a small, dilapidated house with his mother, without a courtyard wall or a gate. In recent years, because walnuts have been selling well and indigo has been planted, he has built seven new houses and a gatehouse, married a wife, and had children. The whole village used to have only one hundred and three head of livestock (referring to 1943, same below), but now it has increased to one hundred and fifty head. There were no mules in the past, but now there are eleven. There were only seventy sheep in the past, but now there are five hundred and fifty-six. The difficulty of fertilizer has also been resolved. In addition, the farmers have worked hard on the land, and now the income per mu of irrigated land has increased from one shi and two dou (market shi, same below) to two shi, and the dry land has increased from eight dou to one shi and four dou. Reaching and slightly exceeding the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. To expand the cultivated area, the villagers have automatically repaired the beaches in recent years, adding 250 mu of paddy fields. This year, in response to the call of the People's Government, the whole village planted 420 mu of Sz cotton, and 180 mu each of tobacco and indigo. The income from these 780 mu is estimated to be equivalent to the income from more than 3,000 mu of corn. In the patriotic pact, everyone agreed to sell all the harvested cotton to the state to ensure the raw materials for the textile industry.

Yantou Village is five li south of Chi'an. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, all but two of the 222 households in the village had their houses burned down by the Japanese invaders. The villagers lived in small caves dug in the wild. After land reform and mutual aid and cooperation, the yield per mu of irrigated land in the village has now exceeded two dou before the war, and the dry land has also exceeded one dou. In addition to the perennial sideline production and the income from walnuts and peppers, half of the houses burned down have now been repaired. In addition to the general nature of mutual aid and cooperation in the village, what is particularly exciting is the large mutual aid group led by labor model Liu Fengzhu. This group has 110 households, with a total of 138 people participating. It has been established for six or seven years. In the past, it mainly engaged in sideline production (dyeing cloth, spinning rope, running flour mills, raising pigs, weaving dustpans, running lumber mills...etc.) to survive the famine. Now it has been combined with agriculture and has developed into a locomotive for finding ways out for farmers' surplus labor, contracting and renting land to farmers without labor, adjusting labor and capital, creating new farming techniques, trying new economic crops, and promoting agricultural production. It leads farmers to implement technical improvements such as removing high spots and padding low spots on cultivated land, changing the terrain, and adjusting various types of soil. Five hundred mu of land in the village has been done this way, with an additional yield of sixty jin of grain per mu. It leads farmers to try Sz cotton, organizes visits, and disseminates cotton management techniques. This year, the group used two mu of cotton to test the effectiveness of fertilization and processing, applying a total of 150 loads of manure (equivalent to three or four times that of ordinary cotton fields), hoeing nine times, and timely and thoroughly controlling aphids, pruning and shaping the branches. The cotton bolls are now particularly large and plump. According to conservative estimates, one mu can yield more than 500 jin of seed cotton. Last winter, the group led the masses to experiment with planting trees in winter, planting a total of 200 poplar and fruit trees, of which 170 survived. Among the members of the group, there were only 25 cattle before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but now they have increased to 104. In addition, there are three new mules, forty pigs, and two hundred and eighty sheep. Forty or fifty households have begun to use flashlights.

Liu Bao'an, one of the young members of Liu Fengzhu's mutual aid group, frankly described the changes in his family's life. Before the war, his family only had one mu of hillside land, his father worked as a long-term laborer outside, and he picked firewood from an early age or herded cattle for others. At that time, there were four people in the family, eating two and a half jin of grain per day, an average of ten liang per person. Now, there are three people eating at home, eating three jin and twelve liang of grain per day, an average of one jin and four liang per person, an increase of one time. In the past, the clothes and quilts they wore and covered were all tattered, but now everyone has a new quilt. He sewed two himself, both made of store-bought cloth. He plans to use them for his free marriage soon. The family now has six cotton-padded clothes, all of which are new. He and his sister each have two sets, and each has one set made of store-bought cloth. In the future, he plans to make a new cotton-padded coat and two new unlined coats every year. He and his sister will no longer wear homespun cloth. The unlined coats will not wear out in the summer and can be worn as undershirts in the autumn and winter (they did not wear undershirts in the past). In the past three years, the family has bought seven new agricultural tools, and plans to buy a cow next year. The source of the money is: first, the family's surplus of more than ten shi of grain in three years (excluding all expenses); second, the 1,400 jin of wages in rice that he has earned in the mutual aid group in the past three years, in addition to food.

In addition, Wang Fengyi, Wang Huaiyi, and Zhang Yulian also described changes in their lives that were roughly the same. Wang Huaiyi's family has already bought two cows and built six houses.

With the rise in living standards, the farmers' demands for learning culture have also become urgent. According to Cui Linsheng, a teacher at the Yantou Village school, people who could not be dragged into the people's school three years ago are now coming automatically. In the past, students did not buy any stationery, but now they automatically buy pens, paper, and books. Fifty or sixty young people have also bought fountain pens. In the past, the elderly obstructed young people from attending people's schools, but now they no longer do so. In the past, students treated teachers like strangers, but now they call "teacher" very affectionately. They also give teachers melons, fruits, or other food during the New Year and holidays. More than a dozen of the most active young male and female students have all made their own study plans during the summer vacation and are working overtime during the hot nap time. According to recent statistics, most of the students in the village school who regularly attend school have already recognized four or five hundred characters. Fifteen people have reached more than 1,500 characters and have become people who can write letters and read newspapers.

Liu Bao'an, mentioned above, who used to herd cattle and pick firewood from an early age, has now become an "intellectual" in Yantou. He drafts work summaries in the large mutual aid group, writes reports to higher authorities, and also writes to the Hebei Daily. He also serves as the accountant for the mutual aid group. He has this level of culture mostly because of his tireless study in winter schools and people's schools. He told me that when he joined the mutual aid group at the age of fourteen, he could only do errands. Later, after being called upon and encouraged by the higher authorities, he made up his mind to learn culture. When he saw new characters on the blackboard or notice, he wrote them down and asked others. When he saw the accountant keeping accounts in the group, he learned the characters on the accounts. When he saw documents and letters from higher authorities, he learned the characters on the documents and letters. When he saw books and newspapers, he studied desperately. He even brought books to the ground and studied when he rested. When the accountant was not there, he learned to do the accountant's work. After four or five years, he was able to serve as an accountant. Since this spring, he has submitted more than twenty articles to the Hebei Daily, and seven have been published. He neatly copied the original manuscripts in his notebook, and as soon as they were published in the newspaper, he used a red pen to correct them himself according to the editor's revisions and studied them in comparison. When the visiting group arrived in Yantou, he was writing an article of more than a thousand words, reporting on Liu Fengzhu's mutual aid group's trial planting of two mu of high-yield cotton, refuting the general saying among farmers that "too much manure does not necessarily result in a higher yield." Judging by the degree of fluency of the text, he is at least equivalent to a student who has graduated from a senior elementary school.

When Liu Bao'an talked about the economic and cultural life in the village, he said with emotion: "In the past, there were also people who lived well, but there were only two or three families in a village. Now there are also people who do not live as well as before, but there are also only those two or three families. In the past, the literate people in the village were all the sons of landlords, but now even someone like me who used to herd cattle and pick firewood has to be literate. In a few years, those with my level of culture will no longer be a minority. All of this was given to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we will always follow the Communist Party!"

Liu Fengzhu said with emotion: "In the past, a farmer was satisfied if he could provide enough food and clothing for his children and wife. What else could he think about? Now it's different: everyone is asking when they can use tractors to farm like Soviet farmers, live in Western-style buildings, and watch movies. The Communist Party has opened up people's horizons, and they want even better things when they have good things, and they want even higher things when they are high."

When the visiting group arrived in She County, the county people's government introduced us to the changes in the county's economic and cultural life, explaining that the situation in Yantou and other villages was not special. Before the war, the average grain yield per mu in the county was 163 jin, last year it was 177 jin, and this year it is 185 jin. Very little cotton was planted before the war, with only 12 jin of lint cotton harvested per mu. This year, 50,000 mu of cotton have been planted, and the harvest of lint cotton per mu is expected to reach 45 jin. The food and clothing of the masses are generally equivalent to the level of Yantou and other villages. Forty-five thousand houses were burned down by the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and 24,120 have now been repaired. Before the war, there were more than 27,000 head of livestock, which was reduced to 14,000 during the war, and now it has increased to more than 29,000. There have also been increases in pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks. In recent years, the county has also newly built 9,800 mu of beach land (for growing rice), repaired 32,900 mu of terraced fields, and newly planted one million fruit trees. More than 1,200 lazy people and loafers have all started to work.

In terms of culture, the county has 321 classes in people's schools (including ten senior elementary school classes) in 209 villages, with 17,979 people regularly attending school (including nearly 5,000 women). There are more than 1,000 teachers in people's schools. In addition, there are fourteen libraries, eighty-four theatrical troupes, elementary schools in almost every village, and newspaper reading groups in almost every village in the county.

As the visiting group left the Clear Zhang River and proceeded to Handan, I thought repeatedly: who but the Communist Party could transform the backward countryside on such a large scale and to such a deep extent, and give it a future full of light? Who could lead so many working people to rise from under the rocks and live with such confidence and hope? Under the leadership of the Chinese working class party—the Communist Party, and through the struggle of the people themselves, everything has changed, and will continue to change and continue to advance in the future. I wish the people by the Clear Zhang River happiness, and I wish the people of all of Taihang and all of China happiness.

    清漳河边
    ——访问太行山老根据地记实
    本报记者  林  韦
    河北涉县境内的清漳河两岸，浓密的芦荻、果树，以至河边洗衣的妇女和玩耍的孩子，似乎都还和过去差不多。但是，当我们放慢脚步仔细观看时，很快就发现了许多的变化。旧日的沙滩，变成了大片大片的稻田，长了饱满的穗；青纱帐里，新增加了大块大块的棉花，结着肥实的花桃。山坡上，道路边，新种了许多小的核桃树、柿树、杨柳树。村庄里，许多被日本强盗烧毁的房子已经修好，变成一座座的新房。河边和水渠上，妇女们洗的衣服有许多已经不是土布衣，而是市布衣。就是土布衣，也很少再有杂色衣和千补万缀的破衣了。一般的说，那都是新衣或半新衣。王堡村农民指着南面不远的水磨告诉我：现在水磨上磨的面，已经不是黑色，而是黄色的了。原因是从前老百姓送来托磨的粮食，一斗玉茭要掺三斗到五斗的糠，现在一斗玉茭只掺一斗左右的糠了。按重量说，糠只占四分之一的样子。这种掺糠的面，过去是早晚甚至午饭都要吃的，现在只是清早吃一顿了。其余两顿，全吃小米或白面、豆面。（按：山西农民清早吃谷面，事实上也等于小米掺糠。）由于同一原因，这几年来的秋后，也没有人再在广场上摆“黑饺子”了（“黑饺子”是用柿子拌糠面捏成的小糠团。每年秋后，农民们在自家的场上成排成行地摆了糠团，晒干当粮食吃）。
    在赤岸和沿头两村，我们访问了若干农民和村干部。赤岸，这是中共太行区党委和太行军区司令部长期居住过的地方。我也在这里住过一个时期。一九四三年的灾荒期间，区党委书记李雪峰、军区司令员李达和其他领导同志，曾经在这儿和我们一道吃“方砖”（黑豆厚饼，切成方块，很像砖头），嚼花椒叶饼，领导着机关干部勤杂人员自种萝?、西红柿，和吃糠咽菜的人民一道生产度荒，领导人民对日本侵略军进行坚决的斗争。现在，战争的创伤已经逐渐医好，人民正在兴致勃勃地发展生产。战争中被日军烧毁的一百三十五间房屋，现已全部修复，并新盖了三十多间。我的房东张来富，从前和他母亲伙住着一个小破屋，没有院墙，没有大门。近年来因为核桃有了销路，又种了靛，现在已经盖了七间新房和门楼，娶了媳妇，生了孩子。全村过去（指一九四三年，下同）只有一百零三头牲口，现在增加到一百五十头。过去无骡子，现有十一头。过去只有七十只羊，现在增加到五百五十六只。肥料的困难，也随着解决了。再加上农民在土地上努力加工，现在水地每亩的收入从一石二斗（市石，下同）增加到二石，旱地从八斗增加到一石四斗。达到并略微超过抗日战争以前的水准。为扩大耕地面积，村民们近年来自动修滩，新增稻田达二百五十亩。今年响应人民政府号召，全村种斯字棉四百二十亩，种烟、靛各一百八十亩。这七百八十亩的收入，据估计相当于三千多亩玉茭的收入。在爱国公约上，大家约定要把所收棉花全部卖给国家，保证纺织工业的原料。
    沿头村在赤岸南五里。抗日期间，全村二百二十二户中除两户外，房屋全被日寇烧毁。村民都在野外挖小窑居住。经过土地改革和互助合作，现在全村水地每亩产量已超过战前二斗，旱地也超过一斗。加上连年副业生产和核桃、花椒的收入，现在被烧的房屋已修复半数。村内除一般性质的互助合作外，特别令人兴奋的是劳动模范刘凤竹领导的大互助组。这个组有一百一十户，共一百三十八人参加。成立已六、七年。以前是主要搞副业生产（染布、纺绳、开粉坊、喂猪、编簸箕、开木厂……等），用以度荒的。现在已和农业结合起来，发展成了为农民的剩余劳力找出路、包耕和租种无劳力农户土地、调剂劳力和资力、创用新的耕作技术、试种新的经济作物、推动农业生产前进的火车头。它领导农民在耕地上实行剔高垫低，改变地形，调剂各色土壤的技术改良。全村有五百亩地这样做了，每亩多收粮六十斤。它领导农民试种斯字棉，组织参观，传播管理棉花的技术。组内今年以二亩棉花试验加肥加工的实效，共上粪一百五十驮（等于普通棉田三、四倍），锄九遍，及时彻底治蚜、打杈整枝，现在花桃特别肥大。据保守的估计，一亩可收籽棉五百多斤。去冬该组领导群众试验冬季种树，杨柳果树共种二百株，活了一百七十株。全组组员中，抗日战争以前只有二十五头牛，现在增至一百零四头。并新增骡子三头，猪四十口，羊二百八十只。有四、五十户开始用手电筒。
    刘凤竹互助组的青年组员之一刘保安，坦诚地向我们叙述他家生活变化的情形。战前他家只有一亩坡地，父亲在外当长工，自己从小拾柴，或给人家放牛。那时候家里四口人，每天吃粮二斤半，每人平均十两。现在三口人在家吃饭，每天吃粮三斤十二两，每人平均一斤四两，增加一倍。过去穿的衣服和盖的被子全是破旧不堪的，现在每个人都有了一条新被。他自己缝了两条，都是市布的。准备最近自由结婚用。家里现有六身棉衣，也都是新的。他和妹妹每人两身，各有一身是市布的。以后准备每年做一身新棉衣，两身新单衣，他和妹妹都不再穿土布。单衣夏天穿不破，秋冬当衬衣穿（过去不穿衬衣）。近三年来，家里买了七件新农具，明年准备买牛。钱的来源，一是家里三年的十石余粮（除了一切花费）；一是他自己在互助组除吃饭外，三年来余下的一千四百斤工资米。
    另有王凤义、王怀义、张玉莲三人，也向我们叙述了程度大体相同的生活变化。王怀义家并已买牛二头，盖房六间。
    随着生活的上升，农民们学习文化的要求也迫切起来。据沿头村民校教员崔林生谈，三年以前还拉也拉不到民校里来的人，现在自动跑来了。从前学员们什么文具也不买，现在都自动买笔、买纸、买书。有五、六十个青年还买了自来水笔。从前老年人阻挠年轻人上民校，现在也不再阻挠了。从前学员对教师如路人，现在喊“老师”喊得非常亲热。过年过节，还给教师送瓜果或其他食物。有十多个最积极的青年男女学员，在暑假期间都自订学习计划，在炎热的午睡时间加班学习。据最近统计，该村民校大部经常到校的学员，都已识得四、五百字。有十五人识字达到一千五百以上，成了能够写信、读报的人。
    前面提到的从小放牛拾柴的刘保安，现在成了沿头的“知识分子”。他在大互助组里起草工作总结，向上级写报告，也向河北日报写稿，还担任互助组的会计。他有这样的文化水平，多半是因为在冬学和民校里不倦学习的结果。他告诉我：他在十四岁上参加互助的时候，还只会做跑腿的事。以后经过上级号召、鼓励，他下定决心要学文化。在黑板上、布告上看到生字，就记下来请教别人。在组里见会计记账，就学账上的字。见上级来了文件，信件，就学文件、信件上的字。见了书，见了报，都拚命学习。甚至上地也带上书本，歇下来就学。会计不在的时候，就学着办会计的事。这样过了四、五年，他就能担任会计了。今春以来，他向河北日报投稿二十多件，已发表七件。他在笔记本上整整齐齐抄着原稿，报上一发表，就依照编辑修改之处，自己用红笔改过来，对照学习。访问团到沿头的时候，他正写了一千多字的一篇稿子，报道刘凤竹互助组试种二亩丰产棉的情形，驳斥一般农民所传“上粪太多不见得多收”的说法。按该稿文字通达的程度说，他至少抵得上一个高小毕业的学生。
    刘保安在谈到村里经济、文化生活的情形时，发表感想说：“从前也有好过的人，可是一村只有两三家。现在也有不如从前好过的，可是也只是那两三家。从前村里识字的都是几个地主的儿子，现在像我这样放牛拾柴的都要识字了。再过几年，有我这样文化程度的就不会再是少数了。这都是共产党、毛主席给我们的，我们永远跟着共产党走！”
    刘凤竹发表感想说：“从前一个庄稼人，闹得孩子老婆有吃有穿算够了，还能想什么？现在可不一样了：谁都在打听什么时候能像苏联农民一样用拖拉机种地，住洋楼，看电影。共产党把人们的眼界打开了，好了还想更好，高了还想更高。”
    在访问团到达涉县城的时候，县人民政府向我们介绍了全县经济、文化生活的变化，说明沿头等村的情形并不特殊。战前全县每亩地平均产粮一百六十三斤，去年一百七十七斤，今年一百八十五斤。战前种棉极少，每亩只收皮棉十二斤。今年植棉达五万亩，每亩收皮棉可望达到四十五斤。群众吃的穿的，一般相当于沿头等村的水准。抗日战争期间被敌人烧毁房屋四万五千间，现已修好二万四千一百二十间。战前牲口二万七千多头，战争期间减至一万四千头，现增至二万九千多头。猪、羊、鸡、鸭也都有增加。全县近年来并新修滩地（种稻）九千八百多亩，修整梯田三万二千九百多亩，新栽果木树一百万株。懒汉二流子一千二百多人，都劳动起来了。
    文化方面，全县二百○九村，组织民校三百二十一班（内十个高小班），经常到校学习的有一万七千九百七十九人（内有妇女近五千人）。民校教师在一千人以上。另外，全县农村有十四个图书馆，八十四个剧团，小学校村村都有，读报组差不多村村都有。
    在访问团离开清漳河向邯郸行进的时候，我反覆地想：除了共产党，谁能在这样大的规模和这样深的程度上变革落后的农村，并给它以光芒万丈的前景？谁能领导这么众多的劳动人民从万丈岩层底下翻起来，生活得如此充满信心与希望？经过中国工人阶级政党——共产党的领导，经过人民自己的斗争，现在，一切都变了，将来还要不断地变，不断地前进。我为清漳河边的人民祝福，为全太行、全中国的人民祝福。
