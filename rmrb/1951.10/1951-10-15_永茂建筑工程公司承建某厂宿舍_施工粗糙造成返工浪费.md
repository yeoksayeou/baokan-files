    Yongmao Construction Company's Construction of a Factory Dormitory:
    Shoddy Construction Results in Rework and Waste
To the Editor:
    The Beijing Public-Operated Yongmao Construction Engineering Company, undertaking the construction of a worker dormitory project for a printing factory, has caused serious rework and waste due to shoddy construction. For example, when laying the first layer of the wall, no grouting was done at all. After the error was pointed out, grouting only began when laying the second layer of the wall, but it had already lost its effect. Most of the walls were built unevenly, requiring more than 50 meters of rework, resulting in a loss of more than 15 million yuan. The sewer equipment was not pre-embedded before the walls were built, but instead, holes were dug under the walls after the house was built. And the first digging was incorrect, so it had to be dug a second time. During construction, the ground level was set six inches too low, so more than 3,000 cubic meters of soil had to be excavated, costing 10,000 yuan per cubic meter, resulting in a total waste of more than 30 million yuan. In terms of materials, the loss due to improper storage, for broken bricks alone, is estimated at 150,000 to 200,000 pieces. Other errors occurred in areas such as installing electrical conduits and toilet sanitary equipment.
    The project started in mid-April and, according to the contract, had to be completed by July 26th. But it has not yet been handed over. Yongmao Construction Company has not formally stated the reasons for the delay to the client. The client has repeatedly raised concerns about the quality of the project, but the company has not provided a formal response. I believe Yongmao Construction Company should conduct a serious review of this irresponsible attitude.  Xiao Jun

    Editor's Note: According to a letter from Yongmao Construction Engineering Company, the company has sent Deputy Manager Liu Lihua to conduct a preliminary inspection of this issue, and will convene a special meeting after the project is completed to conduct a final inspection to summarize the experience and lessons learned. Yongmao Construction Engineering Company should conduct a serious and conscientious inspection, and handle the matter seriously in accordance with the contract.

### 永茂建筑工程公司承建某厂宿舍  施工粗糙造成返工浪费

    永茂建筑工程公司承建某厂宿舍
    施工粗糙造成返工浪费编辑同志：
    北京市公营永茂建筑工程公司，承建某印刷厂的工人宿舍工程，由于施工粗糙，造成严重的返工浪费。比如砌第一层墙时，根本就未灌浆，经指出错误后，砌第二层墙时才开始灌浆，但已失掉了作用。墙壁大部分修得不正，返工达五十多公尺，计损失一千五百多万元。下水道的设备未在垒墙前留洞，而是在房盖好后才在墙下挖洞，并且第一次挖了不对，又挖了第二次。在施工中因将地平面定低了六吋，因此必须多挑出三千余立方公尺土，每立方公尺以一万元计算，共浪费三千多万元。在材料方面来说，因保管不当而损失的，仅碎砖一项估计就有十五万块至二十万块。其他如装置电线管子、厕所卫生设备等方面，都发生了错误。
    该工程于四月中旬动工，依据合同规定，必须在七月二十六日全部完工。但至今尚未交工。永茂工程公司也未正式向委托者声述延迟原因。委托者曾多次对工程质量提出意见，该公司也未作正式答复。我认为永茂工程公司对这种不负责任的态度应作认真的检讨。  晓军
    编者按：据永茂建筑工程公司来信称：该公司已派副经理刘理华对此问题进行了初步检查，并将在工程结束后，召开专门会议，进行最后检查，以总结经验教训。永茂建筑工程公司应严肃认真地进行检查，并按合同规定，认真处理。
