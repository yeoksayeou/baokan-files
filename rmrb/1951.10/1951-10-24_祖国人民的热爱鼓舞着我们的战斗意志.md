    The Motherland's People's Love Inspires Our Fighting Will
    Dear fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters!

    On June 15th, we received a large number of letters of慰问 and慰问 items sent from all over the motherland. After receiving the慰问 items, the comrades carefully preserved them, for fear of damage. Comrade Mei Xiankui was determined to preserve it forever. He said, "Seeing it is like seeing the beloved people of the motherland! It will give me a more resolute fighting will and further strengthen my confidence in victory." A ten-year-old primary school student in Shanxi Province said kindly in his letter: "I am too young to fight alongside uncles, but I also have a patriotic heart. I couldn't bear to spend the money my mother gave me to buy candy, so I bought some books and sent them to you, please read them!" The child's words encouraged the hearts of every soldier. Everyone expressed their attitude: We will definitely repay the care and love of the people of the motherland with practical actions!

    On the Korean battlefield, our lives are very tense, but very pleasant. Now we have established a "teaching and learning" system, and individuals have also set up study plans. Hu Jifang, the deputy squad leader of the ninth squad, and Xue Bin, the learning group leader of the fifth squad, used four wooden sticks to form a square pool, and leveled the inside with fine sand for the comrades to practice writing; Comrade Zhao Liwa of the eighth squad used leaves as paper and carefully practiced writing. The soldiers are not only a heroic fighting force, but also great creators! In addition, many comrades are also patiently learning the Korean language, and they can fully express themselves in Korean for daily life.

    American imperialism is still cunningly playing the shameless trick of undermining the Kaesong talks. However, cunning can never overcome the wisdom of the Chinese and Korean people, and deception will eventually be shattered by truth. We are all waiting in battle, ready to give the enemy a heavy blow at any time!

      With the highest revolutionary salute,
          Cheng Mengfei, Second Platoon, Fifth Company, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

### 祖国人民的热爱鼓舞着我们的战斗意志

    祖国人民的热爱鼓舞着我们的战斗意志亲爱的父老兄弟姊妹们！
    六月十五日，我们接到了由祖国各地运来的大批慰问信和慰问物品。同志们接到慰问物品后，都把它小心翼翼地保存起来，唯恐损坏。梅先魁同志下决心永远地保存着它。他说：“看到了它，就像看到了亲爱的祖国人民！它会给我更坚决的战斗意志，进一步加强胜利的信心。”山西省一个年仅十岁的小学生，他的信里亲切地说：“我的年龄太小，不能同叔叔伯伯们并肩作战，但我同样有一颗爱国的心。妈妈给我买糖果的钱，我舍不得用，买了几本书寄给您，请叔叔伯伯们阅读吧！”孩子的话，鼓舞着每个战士的心。大家都表示了态度：决以实际行动来报答祖国人民的关怀和热爱！
    在朝鲜战场上，我们的生活虽然非常紧张，但非常愉快。现我们建立了“包教保学”制度，个人也订出了学习计划。九班副班长胡继芳和五班学习组长薛斌同志，用四根木棒堆成正方形的池子，里面铺平了细沙，让同志们在上面练习写字；八班赵立娃同志则以树叶作为纸张，细心地练习着写字。战士们不但是一支英勇的战斗部队，而且是伟大的创造者！此外，许多同志也在耐心地学习着朝鲜语言，对于日常的生活，都能用朝鲜话尽情地表达出来了。
    美帝国主义还在狡诈地玩弄着破坏开城谈判的无耻伎俩。但是，狡诈永远战胜不了中朝人民的智慧，欺骗终会被真理所粉碎。我们都在严阵以待，准备随时给敌人沉重的打击！
      致以崇高的革命敬礼
