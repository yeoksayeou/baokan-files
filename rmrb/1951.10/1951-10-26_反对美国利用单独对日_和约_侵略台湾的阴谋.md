    The San Francisco "Peace Conference" manipulated by the United States and the "peace treaty" it passed are not for peace at all in purpose or result, but precisely to undermine peace. In essence, it is a war treaty by which the United States seeks to occupy Japan long-term, revive Japanese militarism to continue and expand the war of aggression against Asia, and prepare for a new world war.
    The American-made "peace treaty" is completely illegal and unacceptable. It has been opposed and resisted by China and the Soviet Union, as well as India and Burma, the second largest country in Asia, and has been opposed and condemned by people all over the world. No rational person could imagine that a peace treaty with Japan could be signed without the participation of China, which fought Japan for the longest time, made the greatest sacrifices, and contributed the most, but by a group of Wall Street fat cats who made fortunes in the war, directing representatives of countries that did not even fight Japan at all during the war. Similarly, no honest person could ever imagine that the content of the peace treaty would not be to ensure the security of countries that had been invaded by Japan, stipulate the return to China of neighboring territories occupied by Japan, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and guarantee Japan's independence and demilitarization, but would instead allow an aggressor nation to use Japan as a base, rearm Japan, and incorporate it into the aggressive camp to launch new wars. The people of the world find it extremely difficult to tolerate the barbarity, unreasonableness, absurdity, and perversity displayed by U.S. imperialism in this so-called "conference" and "treaty."
    Japanese imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Asian people, and for half a century it played the role of executioner in slaughtering the Asian people. It has long, cruelly, and greedily invaded China, and Taiwan was the first place to suffer its poison. The "Tanaka Memorial," which Marshall called the "blueprint for Japanese policy," stated: "Stealing the late Emperor Meiji's legacy, the first stage is to conquer Taiwan..." In 1895, Japan sent troops to occupy Taiwan and enslave Taiwan for 50 years. The Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Taiwan was built on inhumane bloody massacres. In the first few years, tens of thousands of Taiwanese people were killed, and the Japanese bandits wiped out entire villages and families. As late as 1930, it used barbaric means such as airplanes spreading poison gas to deal with the Wushe Uprising of the Gaoshan people. Japanese imperialists drove farmers out of their own fields and annexed more than 70 percent of Taiwan's farmland. It also used administrative power to prohibit indigenous Taiwanese capital from organizing companies, thereby monopolizing 90 percent of Taiwan's business capital. Japanese imperialism plundered countless resources from Taiwan (including rice and sugar), thus plunging the people into semi-starvation. The Taiwanese people have never succumbed to the cruel rule of the Japanese occupiers and will never forget the blood debts owed by the Japanese invaders. From the day the Japanese invaders attacked Taiwan, the Taiwanese people rose up to resist and defended their homeland with precious blood. The early anti-Japanese war of the Taiwanese people lasted until 1902, and they fought bloody battles with the enemy in every town and on every piece of land. Even during the period when Japanese fascist colonial rule had become relatively consolidated, the Taiwanese people launched many uprisings under extremely difficult circumstances. When the uprisings failed, they either calmly went to their deaths in Japanese criminal courts, or, like the Wushe Gaoshan people, committed collective suicide, demonstrating the steadfast patriotism of the Taiwanese people.
    The Taiwanese people grew up in the prison of imperialism, in the flames of the anti-aggression struggle, and were raised on the blood of their ancestors and hatred for imperialism. Therefore, when the Cairo Declaration decided that Taiwan should be returned to China, it was greeted with heartfelt enthusiasm by the Taiwanese people. The decision of the Cairo Declaration must be implemented, the remnants of Japanese militarism must be completely eliminated, and the blood debts owed for fifty years must be repaid. This is the will of the Taiwanese people.
    U.S. imperialism barbarously violates the Cairo Declaration and other relevant international agreements, invades Taiwan, and attempts to occupy it as a base for aggression against China and Asia (just as the Japanese imperialists used Taiwan as a "southward advance" base). All this proves that the United States is the mortal enemy of the Taiwanese people today, just like Japanese imperialism in the past.
    The crime of the United States' invasion of Taiwan began since Japan surrendered. Since 1945, the United States, on the one hand, through the traitorous activities of its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, has seized military bases in Taiwan and controlled Taiwan's economic lifeline. At the same time, it has shamelessly provoked the Taiwanese people's feelings towards the motherland, inciting and directing its lackeys to carry out the so-called "separation" movement. For a long time, the United States has been carrying out its aggression in the Far East in Japan and Taiwan simultaneously: it illegally delays the peace treaty with Japan and rearmed Japan; at the same time, it absurdly uses the excuse that the peace treaty with Japan has not been signed and the status of Taiwan has not been determined to invade Taiwan. The United States' crime of invading Taiwan has been consistently directed by its officials in Japan, and it has used Japan's most heinous war criminals as its assistants, including Okamura Yasuji, Hasegawa Kiyoshi, Nemoto Hiroshi, and others. On June 27, 1950, when it launched the war of aggression against Korea, the United States openly and directly sent its armed forces to occupy Taiwan. Since then, the position of illegally armed Japan in the United States' crime of occupying Taiwan has become increasingly important. The base of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which blockades the Taiwan Strait, is in Japan. The munitions produced in Japan have become an important source of equipment and supplies for the remnants of the Chiang bandits in Taiwan. The United States has also recruited Japanese war criminals and former militarist soldiers to organize a joint U.S.-Japan command to direct and supervise the remnants of the Chiang bandits in Taiwan to continue to be hostile to the Chinese people. Under the open collusion of the United States, Japan, and Chiang, Taiwan is taking shape as a base for U.S. aggression against China, directed and planned by the United States and Japan, with the remnants of the Chiang bandits acting as mercenaries. The American-made peace treaty with Japan disregards the Cairo Declaration and other international agreements regarding the decision to return Taiwan to China, attempting to legitimize and prolong the United States' crime of occupying Taiwan, and further collude with Japanese bandits to assist the United States in occupying Taiwan and invading our mainland.
    As a result of the direct aggression of U.S. imperialism and the criminal rule of its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the Taiwanese people have been living an extremely painful life for the past six years since the war. The U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, in order to suppress the resistance of the Taiwanese people, inherited the Japanese fascist policy and carried out a terrorist massacre. In the ten days after the "February 28th" uprising in 1947, more than ten thousand Taiwanese people were killed. In the following years, the U.S.-Chiang rule in Taiwan became increasingly shaky, and their massacre of the Taiwanese people became increasingly cruel. Prisons and secret agents were all over the island. Due to the plunder of U.S. imperialism and the exorbitant taxes and levies of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, production in Taiwan has stagnated, and the people's living standards have declined. What is even more intolerable is that Japanese militarists, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Taiwanese people, are not only unpunished due to U.S. protection, but have also returned to (help the United States) oppress the Taiwanese people. The so-called Japanese "volunteer army" has been constantly going to Taiwan from Japan for the past two years, and recently its "recruitment" work has been carried out openly and shamelessly on a large scale in various parts of Japan.
    In short, the illegal unilateral peace treaty with Japan made by the United States, as far as Taiwan is concerned, is an attempt to prolong and deepen the U.S.'s crime of aggression against Taiwan in the years since the war. This is a new bloody conspiracy that completely violates the agreements between the Allies during and after the war, violates the will of the Taiwanese and all Chinese people, and serves the U.S. aggression plan.
    The Taiwanese people have consistently opposed imperialist aggression and eagerly hope to return to the embrace of the motherland to work for peaceful and democratic construction. Today, the Taiwanese people must inherit and carry forward the spirit of resisting Japanese and U.S. imperialist aggression for more than 50 years, and wage a resolute struggle against the U.S. aggressors and their lackey, the Chiang bandit gang. Today, our motherland has been liberated, has become strong, and the face of Asia and the world has also changed greatly. As long as the Taiwanese people unite as one, rely on their powerful motherland, unite with the people of all Asia, and fight together, they will surely defeat the U.S. conspiracy to occupy Taiwan for a long time and arm Japan to invade Asia.
    Taiwanese people, unite, and together with the people of the whole country, fight against the U.S. occupation of Taiwan, smash the U.S.'s illegal unilateral peace treaty with Japan, and defeat the U.S. conspiracy to invade Asia!

    反对美国利用单独对日“和约”侵略台湾的阴谋
    台湾民主自治同盟主席  谢雪红
    美国一手操纵的旧金山“和会”和它所通过的对日“和约”，其目的和结果都完全不是为了和平，而恰恰是破坏和平。在实质上它是美国为了长期占领日本，并复活日本军国主义以便继续和扩大侵略亚洲的战争，并准备新的世界战争的战争条约。
    美制“和约”是完全非法的，不能接受的。它受到了中、苏两国和亚洲第二大国——印度以及缅甸的反对和抵制，受到了全世界人民的反对和指责。任何一个具有理性的人都不可能设想，对日和约可以没有对日作战最久、牺牲最大、贡献最多的中国参加签订，而由一群在战争中发财的华尔街大腹贾指使一些甚至在战争中完全没有对日作战过的国家代表来订立。同样，任何一个正直的人也决不可能设想，对日和约的内容可以不是保障受过日本侵略的国家的安全，规定日本所侵占过的邻国领土——例如台湾、澎湖列岛的归还中国，以及日本的独立与非军国主义化之保证等等，而是由一个侵略国家来利用日本作基地、重新武装日本并将其编入侵略阵营去发动新战争。全世界人民对于美帝国主义在此次所谓“和会”及“和约”中所表现的横蛮无理，荒谬乖戾，绝难容忍。
    日本帝国主义是亚洲人民的死敌，它在半个世纪中扮演了屠杀亚洲人民的刽子手的角色。它长期地、惨酷地、贪婪地侵略中国，而台湾是首先遭受其荼毒的地方。被马歇尔称为“日本政策之蓝本”的“田中奏摺”称：“窃明治大帝之遗策，第一期征服台湾……”。一八九五年，日本出兵进占台湾，奴役台湾达五十年之久。日本帝国主义对台湾的殖民统治，建筑在惨无人道的血腥屠杀上，在最初几年中，台湾人民遭杀戮者数万人，日寇整村整族地消灭人民；而一直到一九三○年，它更以飞机散发毒气等野蛮手段，来对付雾社的高山族起义人民。日本帝国主义者把农民驱出自己的田园，兼并了台湾耕地百分之七十以上；它更用行政力量禁止台湾土著资本组织公司，从而垄断台湾企业资本达百分之九十。日本帝国主义从台湾劫掠不可计数的资源（其中包括米和砂糖），因而使人民陷于半饥馑之中。台湾人民在日本占领者的残酷统治下从未屈服，更永远不会忘记日本侵略者的血债。台湾人民从日本侵略者进攻台湾之日起，就奋起抵抗，以宝贵的鲜血来保卫自己的国土。台湾人民初期的抗日战争坚持到一九○二年，在每一个城镇、每一片土地上，都与敌人作过流血的斗争。就是在日本法西斯殖民统治业已相对巩固的时期，台湾人民还在极端困难的情况下，发起了多次的暴动，当暴动失败时，或则在日本刑庭上从容就义，或则如雾社高山族人民集体自杀，表现了台湾人民坚贞不屈的爱国主义精神。
    台湾人民是在帝国主义的监狱中，在反侵略斗争的烈火中生长的，是以先人的鲜血与对帝国主义的仇恨养大的。因此，当开罗宣言决定台湾归还中国的时候，它受到了台湾人民由衷的热烈欢迎。开罗宣言的决定必须实现，日本军国主义残余必须彻底消灭，五十年来所欠的血债必须偿还。这是台湾人民的意志。
    美帝国主义横暴地破坏开罗宣言以及其他有关的国际协议，侵略台湾，企图加以占领作为侵略中国和亚洲的基地（正如日本帝国主义者将台湾作为“南进”基地一样）。凡此，都证明了美国是今天的台湾人民的死敌，正如过去的日本帝国主义一样。
    美国侵略台湾的罪行，从日本投降以来就开始了。一九四五年以来，美国一面通过它的走狗蒋介石匪帮的卖国勾当，攫取台湾的军事基地，控制台湾的经济命脉，同时更百般无耻地挑拨台湾人民对祖国的感情，煽动与指使其走狗进行所谓“分离”运动。很久以来，美国就将其在远东的侵略在日本与台湾齐头并进：它非法拖延对日和约，重新武装日本；同时荒谬地以对日和约尚未订立，台湾地位尚未决定为藉口，侵略台湾。美国侵略台湾的罪行，一贯地由它在日本的官员所指挥，并利用日本罪大恶极的战争罪犯为其助手，包括冈村寗次、长谷川清、根本博………等。到一九五○年六月二十七日，美国更在发动侵朝战争之际，公然直接派遣其武装部队占领台湾。此后，被非法武装了的日本在美国侵占台湾罪行中的地位就益发重要了，封锁台湾海峡的美国第七舰队的基地在日本，日本所生产的军火成为台湾蒋匪残军装备补给的重要来源，美国更网罗日本战争罪犯、军国主义旧军人组织了美、日共同的指挥部，指挥和监督台湾蒋匪残军继续与中国人民为敌。在美、日、蒋公然勾结之下，台湾正在形成为美国侵略中国的一个基地，由美、日指挥策划，而由蒋匪残军充当雇佣兵。而美制对日“和约”竟置开罗宣言及其他国际协议关于台湾归还中国之决定于不顾，妄图使美国侵占台湾的罪行合法化与长期化，并更进一步勾引日寇来协助美国侵占台湾、侵略我国大陆。
    由于美帝国主义直接侵略及其走狗蒋介石匪帮罪恶统治的结果，台湾人民在战后六年来，一直过着极端痛苦的生活。美、蒋反动派为镇压台湾人民的反抗，承袭日本法西斯政策，进行了恐怖的屠杀，在一九四七年“二、二八”起义后，旬日间台湾人民被杀者逾万；其后数年，美、蒋在台湾的统治益趋动摇，其对台湾人民的屠杀亦益趋残酷，监狱、特务遍布全岛。由于美帝国主义的掠夺，美国走狗蒋介石匪帮的横征暴敛，台湾生产停顿，人民生活愈益降低。而尤为令人不能容忍者，双手满染台湾人民鲜血的日本军国主义分子，不仅由于美国庇护不受惩罚，且重新前来（帮助美国）压迫台湾人民；所谓日本“志愿军”两年来即不断由日赴台，而最近其“招募”工作，更在日本各地公然无耻地大规模进行中。
    总之，美制非法片面对日“和约”，对台湾说来，是企图将美国战后数年来对台湾的侵略罪行延长并且加深。这是完全违反战时及战后盟国间的协议、违反台湾和全中国人民的意志，而服务于美国侵略计划的新的血腥阴谋。
    台湾人民一贯反对帝国主义的侵略，热烈期望回到祖国怀抱中为和平民主建设而努力。今天，台湾人民要继承并发挥五十多年来反抗日、美帝国主义侵略的精神，与美国侵略者及其走狗——蒋匪帮进行坚决的斗争。今天，我们的祖国已经解放了，强大起来了，亚洲和世界的面貌也已经大大改变了。台湾人民只要团结一致，依靠自己的强大祖国，联合全亚洲人民，共同奋斗，一定能打败美国长期侵占台湾、武装日本侵略亚洲的阴谋。
    台湾人民团结起来，与全国人民一起，为反对美国侵占台湾，粉碎美国非法的片面对日“和约”，打败美国侵略亚洲的阴谋而斗争！
