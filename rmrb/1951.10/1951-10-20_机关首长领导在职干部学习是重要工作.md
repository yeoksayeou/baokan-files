    Leading Cadres of Government Agencies Should Lead On-the-Job Training – An Important Task
    Editor:
    The People's Daily's "Cultural Life Brief Comments" on October 4th, "Agency Leaders Should Pay Attention to On-the-Job Cadre Learning" pointed out that the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government attaches importance to cadre learning, and Minister Li Shucheng personally participates in the leadership and personally inspects the learning of department-level cadres, so the Ministry's learning has been very good. The article also pointed out: There are still some agency leaders who do not care or do not care much about agency learning, and push agency learning to others to manage. This phenomenon should be improved. I think this brief comment is of great significance. According to my current understanding, the phenomenon of agency leaders not paying attention to on-the-job cadre learning is quite common. Therefore, two problems have arisen: 1. The people inside the agency who guide theoretical learning have a low level of theoretical knowledge, and they cannot solve problems when guiding others to study theory; 2. Some cadres regard theoretical learning as a political benefit, and some don't even know how to read, but they are unwilling to learn culture and want to participate in theoretical learning. This seriously affects the on-the-job learning of cadres in agencies. I suggest that all agency leaders participate in leading the work of on-the-job cadre learning in the future. Only in this way can we do a good job in the on-the-job learning of cadres in agencies; only in this way can we improve the working ability of on-the-job cadres in agencies.

### 机关首长领导在职干部学习是重要工作

    机关首长领导在职干部学习是重要工作编辑同志：
    十月四日人民日报《文化生活简评》《机关首长应重视在职干部学习》一文指出：中央人民政府农业部重视干部学习，部长李书城亲自参加领导，并亲自检查司长一级的学习，因而该部的学习一直搞得很好。该文并指出：现在还有些机关的首长，不关心或者不甚关心机关学习，把机关学习推给别人来管，这种现象应加以改进。我觉得这个简评，意义非常重大。据我目前的了解，机关首长不重视在职干部学习的现象，确是相当普遍的。因此，就产生了两种毛病：一、机关内部指导理论学习的人理论水平较低，他们指导别人学习理论，解决不了问题；二、有些干部把理论学习认作政治待遇，有的甚至连字也不认识，却不愿学习文化，而要参加理论学习。这样，就严重地影响了机关在职干部学习。我建议各机关首长今后都参加领导在职干部学习的工作。只有如此，才能搞好机关在职干部的学习；也只有如此，才能提高机关在职干部的工作能力。
