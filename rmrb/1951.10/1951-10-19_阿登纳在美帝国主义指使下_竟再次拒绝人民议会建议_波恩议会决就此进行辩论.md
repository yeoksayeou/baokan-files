Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 17th (TASS dispatch): According to a Deutsche Press Agency (DPA) report from Bonn, Bonn Chancellor Adenauer issued a government statement on October 16th regarding the proposal made by the German Democratic Republic's People's Chamber on October 10th. In this statement, Adenauer did not answer the People's Chamber's questions to the Federal Council, namely: (1) Does the Federal Council agree that a pan-German conference with representatives from East and West Germany should be held in the near future to discuss issues of vital importance to the German people? (2) Does the Federal Council agree to discuss the following two issues at this pan-German conference: the holding of free, all-German elections to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and the acceleration of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany?

Adenauer once again opposed the convening of a pan-German conference. Although Bonn government officials had formally informed the Federal Council before the Federal Council meeting that Adenauer was scheduled to issue a statement to the Federal Council on October 17 regarding the People's Chamber proposal, Adenauer issued the statement on October 16, much to the surprise of the parliamentarians.

DPA news indicates that Adenauer and the U.S. High Commissioner for West Germany originally attempted to avoid a public debate in parliament to evade the issues raised by the People's Chamber, but this attempt was defeated. Due to proposals from the German Communist Party and the German Social Democratic Party parliamentarians, the parliament passed a resolution by a large majority to debate Adenauer's statement on October 17.

    阿登纳在美帝国主义指使下
    竟再次拒绝人民议会建议
    波恩议会决就此进行辩论
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社柏林十七日讯：据德意志通讯社波恩讯，波恩总理阿登纳于十月十六日就德意志民主共和国人民议会十月十日的建议发表政府声明。阿登纳在这个声明中并没有答复人民议会对联邦议会所提出的下述问题，即：（一）联邦议会同意应在最近的将来举行有德国东部与西部代表参加的全德会议以讨论对德国人民有切身重要性的问题吗？（二）联邦议会同意在这个全德会议上讨论下述两个问题，即举行全德自由选举以期建立统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的问题以及加速缔结对德和约的问题吗？
    阿登纳再次出而反对召开全德会议。虽然波恩政府的官员曾经在联邦议会没有开会之前正式告诉联邦议会说，阿登纳定于十月十七日在联邦议会就人民议会建议发表声明，可是阿登纳却在十月十六日就发表了这个声明，使议员们都感到大为诧异。
    德意志通讯社的消息指出，阿登纳和美国驻西德高级专员原来企图不在议会内作公开的辩论，以此来避开人民议会所提出的问题，可是这个企图被打败了。由于德国共产党和德国社会民主党议员的提议，议会以绝大多数通过一项决议，决定在十月十七日就阿登纳的声明进行辩论。
