Xinhua News Agency, London, 19th: Under the call of the Communist Party of Great Britain, the British people are taking active actions to defeat the mortal enemy of the British people, the Conservative Party, in the upcoming general election, and to demand that the Labour Party change its policies.

Workers in many factories across Britain have set up "Defeat the Conservative Party" election committees. According to a report by the Telecommunications Agency on the 16th, Labour Party and Communist Party workers in another nine factories in London (including the giant Havilland factory) have jointly formed election committees to combat the Conservative Party. The National Union of Mineworkers also issued a declaration on the 11th, calling on miners to defeat the Conservative Party in the general election. According to a report in the London *Daily Worker*, the district committees of various construction trade unions in Manchester have held a joint meeting, demanding that all union members strive for a Labour government that works to achieve peace among the major powers. Shop stewards of the Combined Machine Workers Union in Paisley, Scotland, passed a resolution to "Defeat the Conservative Party" at a quarterly meeting. Shop stewards of the Combined Machine Workers Union in Bristol, Gloucester, and Gistfield also passed the same resolution. The Bristol resolution declared: The "central issue is to maintain peace and conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact."

When Conservative Party leader Churchill delivered his first campaign speech in Liverpool on the evening of the 2nd, he was met head-on by the working masses of Liverpool. That evening, trade union members and Communist Party members in Liverpool held a lively open-air rally to oppose "war-monger number one" Churchill. After the meeting, a demonstration was held, with the masses holding aloft signs that read: "Don't let Churchill drag Britain into war!"

Standing at the forefront of the struggle, the Communist Party of Great Britain is making tireless efforts to call on British workers to vote for Communist Party candidates who defend the interests of the working class. British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt gave a speech on the 14th, stating that only Communist Party candidates are loyal to the ideals that have been greatly betrayed by the right-wing Labour Party. Pollitt pointed out that British workers not only need to defeat the Conservative Party, but also need to wage a similar struggle against Labour leaders who are trying to completely turn the workers' movement into a tool of capitalism.

    英国许多工厂成立选举组织
    响应英国共产党号召
    为击败保守党而斗争
    【新华社十九日讯】伦敦消息：英国人民在英国共产党的号召下，正采取积极的行动为在即将到来的大选中击败英国人民的死敌——保守党和要求工党改变政策而斗争。
    英国各地许多工厂的工人已纷纷组织“击败保守党”选举委员会。据电通社十六日报道，伦敦又有九个工厂（包括巨大的哈威兰工厂）的工党工人和共产党工人，已联合组成选举委员会以打击保守党。全国矿工联盟也在十一日发表宣言，号召矿工们在大选中击败保守党。另据伦敦《工人日报》报道，曼彻斯特各建筑工会的区委员会已举行联席会议，要求工会全体会员争取一个为谋取大国间的和平而努力的工党政府。苏格兰派斯利区混合机器工会的车间代表已在季度会议上通过“击败保守党”的决议。布利斯托尔、格罗斯忒、吉斯特菲尔德的混合机器工会的车间代表也通过了同样的决议。布利斯托尔的决议宣称：选举的“中心问题是维护和平缔结五大国和平公约”。
    当保守党领袖邱吉尔于二日晚在利物浦发表他第一次的竞选演说时，他遭到利物浦工人群众的迎头打击。当天晚上，利物浦的工会会员和共产党员举行了热烈的露天大会，反对“头号战争贩子”邱吉尔，会后并举行游行示威，群众高举标语牌，上面写着：“不要让邱吉尔把英国带进战争！”
    站在斗争最前列的英国共产党正在进行不倦的努力，号召英国工人投票选举保卫工人阶级利益的共产党候选人。英共总书记波立特十四日发表演说称：只有共产党候选人才忠于被右翼工党所大大背叛了的理想。波立特指出，英国工人不仅需要击败保守党，而且对于企图把工人运动完全变成资本主义的工具的工党领袖们，也需要进行一个同样的斗争。
