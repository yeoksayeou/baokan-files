Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau cracked a case in July this year involving counter-revolutionary activities by imperialist missionaries. The principal offenders, Fei Shengyuan, De Shangpu, An Ning, Pei Fangji, Peng Guangyuan, and Jia Haoran (all French), were arrested. After more than two months of interrogation, the Military Tribunal of the Shenyang Municipal Military Control Commission sentenced the above-mentioned offenders on the 8th of this month to imprisonment and deportation.

    The offenders Fei Shengyuan, etc., were bishops or priests of the Catholic Diocese of Shenyang and Yingkou. After the liberation of Shenyang, they actively developed the counter-revolutionary organization "Legion of Mary," and collected counter-revolutionary elements such as Li Enkai (secretary of war criminal Yu Bin), Zhang Baogui (Kuomintang army officer), Tong Wenyuan, etc., hiding guns, ammunition, poison, and telecommunications equipment, plotting sabotage activities. During the interrogation, they all confessed to having engaged in activities harmful to the Chinese people for a long time under the guise of religion. For example, Fei Shengyuan, the Catholic Bishop of Yingkou, came to China in 1923. Before the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, he helped the Japanese-sponsored spy, the Frenchman Bao Keshu, to collect "information on the garrison situation of the Beidaying Barracks in Shenyang." After the "September 18th" Incident, he again helped Bao Keshu to gather intelligence on the "distribution of anti-Japanese troops" and provided it to the Japanese occupation authorities. He also submitted a statement to the so-called "League of Nations Investigation Commission" in the name of the church, supporting the Japanese long-term occupation of Northeast China. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Fei Shengyuan turned to colluding with the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, participated in the special agent peripheral organization "Religious Fraternization Association" and the armed special agent organization "Religious Suppression of Rebellion and National Salvation Army" led by Yu Bin, and sheltered international agents such as Lei Zhenyuan engaged in espionage activities in the Northeast. On September 8, 1948, he issued a so-called "confidential notice" calling on all the priests in his diocese to be the so-called "cornerstones of rejecting communism." Another example is the French priest De Shangpu of the Catholic Diocese of Shenyang, who came to China in 1940 and was the main leader of the Shenyang "Legion of Mary" organization. He consistently instilled reactionary ideas of hatred towards the Chinese people and opposition to the People's Government into the believers, hindering the believers from participating in the movement to resist America and aid Korea. When Shenyang launched a vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries in May this year, De Shangpu funded the counter-revolutionary Zhang Baogui with US dollars and wrote a letter introducing him to Xiao Yongxin (who has been arrested), the head of the Tianjin Legion of Mary, for shelter. When the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested them, they found two pistols, seventy-six bullets, two small shells, two daggers, three bottles of arsenic, a radio parts and correspondence between them and the Japanese, American, and Chiang Kai-shek intelligence agencies, maps, and hundreds of reactionary books and periodicals.

    The Military Tribunal of the Shenyang Municipal Military Control Commission ruled on the case as follows: Fei Shengyuan, sentenced to three years in prison, suspended, and deported from China; De Shangpu, An Ning, Pei Fangji, Peng Guangyuan, and Jia Haoran, five offenders, were all deported from China. The sentences for the six offenders were executed on October 12th. The Military Tribunal also sentenced the counter-revolutionaries Li Enkai, Tong Wenyuan, and Zhang Baogui, who were related to the case, separately.
Xinhua News Agency. The Shanghai Municipal Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued an order on the 8th, announcing the ban on the international secret reactionary organization "Legion of Mary" under the guise of religion. The order of the Military Control Commission stated: Before the liberation of Shanghai, imperialist elements such as Li Peili and Mo Keqin had planned to collect reactionary elements as backbone members and actively expand the "Legion of Mary" reactionary organization, undermining the cause of people's liberation. After liberation, the reactionary activities of the "Legion of Mary" became more and more intensified, such as colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek armed forces, collecting intelligence, hiding radio stations and weapons, printing and distributing reactionary books and periodicals, spreading rumors, undermining the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and the independent innovation movement of Catholics, which have been repeatedly discovered. All of this proves that the "Legion of Mary" is by no means a purely religious group, but a reactionary tool for imperialist elements to collude with counter-revolutionary elements to invade, sabotage the motherland, and undermine the people's democratic cause. In order to protect the interests of the people, maintain social order, and protect legitimate freedom of belief, in addition to arresting and interrogating the ringleaders of the "Legion of Mary" and punishing them in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," it is hereby decided to ban the "Legion of Mary" reactionary organization from now on.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The Military Control Commissions of Nanjing, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang have recently successively issued orders to ban the international secret reactionary organization "Legion of Mary" in the three cities. The "Legion of Mary" in these three cities were all established after the liberation of the respective locations, and their purpose was to oppose the people's power and undermine the construction cause of the new China. Under the direct command of the imperialist element Li Peili, the Nanjing "Legion of Mary" organization has continuously spread rumors, posted reactionary slogans, and undermined the patriotic movement of the people of Nanjing. The American "Director Priest" of the "Legion of Mary", Du Hua (who has been deported by us), after the liberation of Nanjing, lured and sent more than a dozen young students from the former Hongguang Middle School to Manila, Macau, and other places to receive training from American agents, preparing to send them back to the mainland in the future to carry out special agent sabotage activities; another "Director Priest", Guo Zongyan, colluded with Kuomintang armed agents and served as the head of the bandit "Lubei Branch of the People's National Salvation Corps." He once sheltered Zhang Zhendong, an important special agent sent by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the commander of the bandit "First Column of the Youth National Salvation Army" to the mainland to carry out sabotage and assassination activities. The backbone elements of the Taiyuan "Legion of Mary" are mostly special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan gangs. For example, Fan Lanpeng, the president of the "Taiyuan Legion of Mary District Council," was the "political director" of the bandit "Shanxi Column of the North China Anti-Communist Self-Salvation Army." The Shijiazhuang "Legion of Mary" has also carried out various sabotage activities. In order to protect the interests of the people and safeguard true freedom of belief, the Military Control Commissions of Nanjing, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang have respectively ordered the banning of this counter-revolutionary organization, and stipulated that general "members" should declare their withdrawal from the "Legion of Mary" to the local Public Security Bureau, and "staff" above the branch level must register.
Xinhua News Agency Correction: In the draft "Liaison Officers of Both Sides Continue to Investigate the Incident of American Aircraft Strafing the Neutral Zone" issued on the 14th, "Pu Xieyang" should be "Pu Zhengyang." Correction: In the editorial "Strive to Complete the Patriotic Donation Plan!" of this newspaper on September 30th, in the first paragraph, "In addition, the people of Rehe Province have pledged 12,100 roe deer in kind," the "Rehe Province" is a mistake for "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region."

    沈阳市判决帝国主义传教士阴谋破坏案
    上海南京等市军管会宣布取缔“圣母军”
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】沈阳市人民政府公安局在今年七月间破获了一件帝国主义传教士进行反革命活动的案件，主犯费声远、德尚朴、安宁、裴舫济、彭光远、贾浩然六人（都是法国人）都被捕。经过两个多月的审讯后，沈阳市军事管制委员会军事法庭在本月八日判决了上列各犯以徒刑和驱逐出国境的处分。
    费声远等犯是天主教沈阳教区和营口教区的主教或神甫。他们在沈阳解放以后，积极地发展反革命组织“圣母军”，搜罗反革命分子李恩凯（战犯于斌秘书）、张宝贵（蒋匪军官）、佟文元等，隐藏枪枝、弹药、毒药和电信器材，阴谋进行破坏活动。在审讯中，他们都供认曾长期地以宗教为掩护进行危害中国人民的活动。例如：天主教营口教区主教费声远是一九二三年来到我国的。一九三一年“九一八”事变前，他曾帮助日寇豢养的间谍法国人包克书，搜集“沈阳北大营驻军情况”。“九一八”后，他又帮助包克书刺探“抗日部队分布情况”的情报，供给日本占领当局。他并以教会名义向当时的所谓“国际联盟调查团”递送声明书，拥护日寇长期侵占我国东北。抗日战争胜利后，费声远转而和美、蒋相勾结，参加了于斌所领导的特务外围组织“宗教联谊会”和武装特务组织“宗教戡乱救国军”，并掩护国际特务雷振远等在东北从事间谍活动。一九四八年九月八日，他发出所谓“机密通知”，号召他所辖教区的全体神甫做所谓“拒绝共产主义的柱石”。又如天主教沈阳教区法籍神甫德尚朴于一九四○年来到中国，是沈阳“圣母军”组织的主要头目，一贯向教徒灌输仇恨我国人民和反对人民政府的反动思想，阻碍教徒参加抗美援朝运动。今年五月沈阳市大张旗鼓镇压反革命时，德尚朴曾以美金资助反革命分子张宝贵，并写信介绍他到天津圣母军头子萧永新（已被捕）处躲避。市公安局在逮捕他们时，曾在他们的住处搜查出手枪两枝、子弹七十六发、小炮弹两枚、匕首两把、砒霜三瓶、电台零件一部和他们与日、美、蒋匪情报机关的来往信件、地图以及反动书刊数百份。
    沈阳市军事管制委员会军事法庭对此案的判决如下：费声远徒刑三年，缓期执行，驱逐出我国国境；德尚朴、安宁、裴舫济、彭光远、贾浩然五犯都驱逐出我国国境。对该六犯的判决并已于十月十二日执行。军事法庭对和此案有关的反革命分子李恩凯、佟文元、张宝贵也分别作了判处。 【新华社讯】中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会在八日发出命令，宣布取缔以宗教外衣为掩护的国际性秘密反动组织“圣母军”。军管会的命令说：上海解放前，黎培里、莫克勤等帝国主义分子即有计划地搜罗反动分子为骨干，积极扩大“圣母军”反动组织，破坏人民解放事业。解放后，“圣母军”的反动活动愈益加厉，诸如勾结蒋匪武装、搜集情报、隐藏电台武器、印发反动书刊、散播谣言、破坏抗美援朝运动以及天主教徒的自立革新运动，屡有发现。凡此均证实“圣母军”绝非单纯宗教团体，而完全是帝国主义分子勾结反革命分子进行侵略、破坏祖国、破坏人民民主事业的反动工具。为了保障人民利益，维护社会秩序，保护正当的信仰自由，除将“圣母军”首恶分子逮捕审讯，按照“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”予以惩治外，特决定自即日起取缔“圣母军”反动组织。
    【新华社十五日讯】南京、太原和石家庄三市的军事管制委员会最近相继下令取缔该三市的国际性秘密反动组织“圣母军”。这三个城市中的“圣母军”都是在各该地解放以后建立起来的，它们的目的是反对人民政权，破坏新中国的建设事业。南京市的“圣母军”组织在帝国主义分子黎培里的直接指挥下，曾经不断地散布谣言，张贴反动标语，破坏南京市人民的爱国运动。“圣母军”美籍“指导司铎”杜华（已被我驱逐出境）在南京解放后，曾诱骗与遣送前弘光中学青年学生十多人至马尼拉、澳门等地受美国特务训练，准备将来把他们派回大陆进行特务破坏活动；另一“指导司铎”郭宗言跟国民党武装特务相勾结，担任匪“民众救国团鲁北分团”团长，他曾掩护台湾蒋匪派来大陆的重要特务、匪“青年救国军第一纵队”司令张振东破坏暗害活动。太原市“圣母军”的骨干分子大都是蒋、阎匪帮的特务，例如“太原圣母军区会”会长樊兰朋就是匪“华北反共自救军山西纵队”的“政治主任”。石家庄市的“圣母军”也曾进行了各种破坏活动。南京、太原和石家庄三市的军事管制委员会为了保护人民利益，保障真正的信仰自由，因此分别下令取缔这一反革命组织，并规定一般“团员”应向当地公安局声明退出“圣母军”，支会以上的“职员”并须进行登记。新华社更正十四日所发“双方联络官继续调查美机扫射中立区事件”稿中，“朴燮阳”应为“朴正阳”。更正九月三十日本报社论“为完成爱国捐献计划而奋斗！”第一段内“此外尚有热河省人民认捐的实物黄羊一万二千一百只”，其中“热河省”系“内蒙古自治区”之误。
