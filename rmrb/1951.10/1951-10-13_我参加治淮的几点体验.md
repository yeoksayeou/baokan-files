    My Experiences Participating in the Huai River Project
    Henan Provincial Huai River Project Political Department Work Team, Xia Jiangbo
    Corrected My Erroneous View of Despising Labor
    I am a cadre who transferred from the military. In October of last year, I was transferred from the army to a local position and assigned to participate in the great Huai River project. Last winter, I participated in the larger old Wangpo depression flood storage project in Henan; this spring, I was assigned to Shimantan to participate in the construction of a mountain valley reservoir. These two experiences have been a most practical exercise for me.
    The phrase "Labor creates the world" is not new to me, but I had not truly resolved the issue in my mind, which was reflected in my sometimes even being unwilling to work. This time, the living textbook on the construction site gave me a lesson. During my five months and three days of work in Shimantan, I participated from the beginning of digging and heaving earth to the successful completion. Every day I had the opportunity to meet with more than 40,000 members of the labor army. For the sake of future happiness, they worked tirelessly day and night.
    Shimantan was originally a desolate mountain valley. But after the Huai River project started, a sea of people surged on the construction site of less than ten square kilometers. Crowds of people, like ants, moved everywhere on the hillsides and at the foot of the mountains. The workers carried new soil and crushed stones, shuttling back and forth at a brisk pace, while carts cycled one after another on the light rails laid by the workers themselves, transporting the soil to the dam. Dozens of scrapers, loaders, bulldozers, and flushing machines traveled back and forth around the dam to transport the soil. These machines serving the project, with the words "Made in America" still written on them, show that these tools were seized from the hands of the reactionaries, and today the workers master them as masters, as weapons to eliminate floods for the people. On the construction site, I also saw workers digging the water diversion tunnel, cautiously controlling the rock drill, and waging a tenacious battle against the hard red flint. Thanks to their active efforts and continuous overcoming of difficulties, they opened up the tunnel, which was expected to take a month, in seventeen days.
    On the construction site, Chairman Mao's call to "Be sure to harness the Huai River well" and the slogan "Building reservoirs well is resisting America and aiding Korea" inspired the work enthusiasm of every worker. The higher authorities called on each person to dig half a cubic meter of soil every day, but many workers exceeded one cubic meter with their diligence and hard work. The Shiqiao team of Wuyang County, within a transportation distance of 500 meters, averaged 1.5 cubic meters of soil dug and transported per person per day. Some workers continued to work even with their hands worn out, and ran barefoot on the pebble road to carry soil without shoes. They could dig mud in the frozen river in winter, and dig soil in the hot summer. In short, they could endure any hardship, do any work, and overcome any difficulty. In just four months, a great mountain valley reservoir capable of storing 47 million cubic meters of floodwater was built in a desolate mountain valley.
    The great reality educated me, made me further realize that despising labor is an erroneous view, and made me deeply appreciate the hardworking and brave spirit of the Chinese working people, which is enough to overcome all difficulties and complete any great construction task of new China. Cultivated the Spirit of Collectivism Among Farmers. Secondly, I deeply realized that with the progress of the project, the workers gained a lot of new knowledge and developed many new habits. Many workers in Wuyang County, after returning home upon completion of the project, could no longer tolerate the loose and backward living habits of their families. They used the living habits of collective labor that they had personally experienced when building the reservoir to educate their families. On the construction site, I often participated in their merit evaluation and scoring meetings. I saw that many workers understood the principle of more work, more gain. They seriously put forward their opinions without any hesitation, giving more where more was due, and less where less was due. This gave them a very profound collective education. With the progress of the project, cultural entertainment also formed a craze among the workers. On the construction site, I saw many workers composing and performing, singing new songs, and performing Yangko dances, which had become a movement. The literacy movement has become an indispensable part of the daily life of the workers. Li Tiancai, a worker in the Hekou team of Wuyang County, who did not know a single character in the past, recognized a total of 500 characters in more than three months and was able to write simple letters.
    Farmers See Machines Breaking Conservative Ideas
    In addition, there are various kinds of different machines on the construction site. Taking the scraper as an example, if it is turned on and calculated for eight hours a day, one machine can replace 800 workers digging soil. The facts educated the farmers and broke their conservative ideas. Many workers ran to the machine and gently stroked it, listening to the driver introduce the function of the machine, the story of the Soviet elder brother using machines to cultivate the land, and the prospect that new China will soon use machines to cultivate the land. The workers were very happy to hear this and kept learning technology from the workers. Many workers had never even seen a machine before, but under the enthusiastic education of the workers and their own hard work, they quickly learned technical work such as laying rails, holding air drills (rock drills), erecting wires, and installing electric lights. From this, I realized that the Huai River construction site is also a good classroom for educating the people. Everyone who participates in the Huai River project can learn a lot of new knowledge as long as they study diligently and humbly. Seeing the spirit of mutual learning between workers and peasants, I deeply realized the great power of the worker-peasant alliance and the beautiful prospects of the construction of new China.
    Farmers Along the Huai River Thank Chairman Mao
    The Shimantan Reservoir has been successfully completed, and the people along the Huai River have happily sung: The Huai River bay, the Huai River is long, the Huai River banks are rice and grain; the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the harmful wolf, dug up the Yellow River and hurt people; Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, your kindness is like parents; the land is divided, liberated, and the Huai River is well managed and happy.
    This is a song sung by the people to express their inner joy. In mid-August, when I and seven or eight comrades took a car to leave the reservoir and return to Kaifeng, as the car sped, looking back to the south, I saw that what was a desolate mountain valley four months ago has now been built into a brand-new reservoir. Everywhere along the road you can see the endless, plump, and soon-to-be-ripe crops, presenting a scene of harvest everywhere. The bright prospects of China's future water conservancy construction constantly appeared in my mind.

    我参加治淮的几点体验
    河南省治淮政治部工作队  夏江波
    纠正了我轻视劳动的错误观点
    我是一个部队干部。去年十月我由军队转业到地方，就被分配参加伟大的治淮工作。去冬我参加了河南较大的老王坡洼地蓄洪工程；今春又被分配到石漫滩，参加山谷水库修建工作。这两次工作，对我是一个最实际的锻炼。
    “劳动创造世界”这句话，对我说来已经不生疏，但在思想上并没有真正解决问题，这表现在我有时甚至不愿意劳动。这次工地上的活生生的教材给我上了一课。我在石漫滩五个月零三天的工作中，从开始挖土掀土直到胜利竣工，始终都在参加。我每天都有机会和四万多个劳动大军见面。为了未来的幸福，他们昼夜不停地辛勤地工作着。
    石漫滩原是一片荒凉的山谷。但治淮工程动工后，在方圆不到十平方公里的工地上，涌现一片人海。山坡上、山脚下像蚂蚁一样的人群到处游动。民工们抬着新土、碎石，以轻快的脚步穿梭似地来往飞跑，斗车一队接一队在民工自己铺设的轻便铁轨上循环行驶，把土运到坝上。数十辆铲运机、装土机、推土机、冲卸机，在坝的周围来往奔驶运土。这些为工程服务的机械，上面还写着美国制造的字样，表明这些工具是从反动派手里夺过来，今天工人们以主人翁的姿态掌握着它，作为替人民消除水灾的武器。在工地上，我又看到开挖输水洞的工人，谨慎地掌握着开山机，向坚硬的红英石作顽强的战斗。由于他们的积极努力，和不断克服困难，十七天便打通了预计一个月才能打通的隧洞。
    工地上，毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的号召和“修好水库就是抗美援朝”的口号，鼓舞着每个民工的工作热情。上级号召每人每天要挖半方土，但许多民工都以勤劳刻苦的精神超过了一方。舞阳县石桥中队在五百公尺的运输距离内，每人每天平均挖土运土达到一点五公方。有的民工手磨破了仍坚持工作，没有鞋穿就赤脚在石子路上抬土飞跑。他们能在冬季结冰的河里挖泥，又能在炎热的暑天挖土，总之，什么苦都能吃，什么活都能干，任何困难都能克服。在短短的四个月里，就在一片荒凉的山谷里，修建起一座可蓄四千七百万立方公尺洪水的伟大山谷水库。
    伟大的现实教育了我，使我进一步认识到轻视劳动是错误观点，使我深刻体会到我国劳动人民的勤劳勇敢精神，足以战胜一切困难，完成新中国的任何伟大建设任务。培养了农民集体主义的精神其次，我又深刻体会到：随着工程的进展，民工们增长了许多新的知识和养成了许多新习惯。舞阳县很多民工完工回到家里，对家庭散漫落后的生活习惯已看不惯。他们拿建设水库时亲身体验过的集体劳动的生活习惯来教育家庭。在工地上，我常参加他们的评功记分会，我见到许多民工都懂得了多劳多得的道理，他们没有任何顾虑地认真地提出自己的意见，该多就多，该少就少。这给他们以很深刻的集体主义教育。随着工程的进展，文化娱乐也在民工中形成了热潮。在工地上，我看到许多民工自编自演，自拉自唱，唱新歌，扭秧歌，已形成了运动。识字运动更成了民工每日生活中不可少的一件工作。舞阳县河口中队民工李天才，过去一字不识，三个多月一共认识到五百字，并能写简单的信。
     农民看到机器打破了保守观念
    另外，在工地上还有各种各样不同的机器，单拿铲运机来说，开动以后每天以八小时计算，一部机可顶八百个民工挖土。事实教育了农民，打破了他们的保守观念。不少民工跑到机器旁用手轻轻地抚摸着机器，听着司机向他们介绍机器的功用，和苏联老大哥用机器耕种土地的故事，以及新中国也很快就会用机器耕地的前景。民工们听了很高兴，不断向工人学习技术。原来许多民工连机器都没见过，但在工人的热心教育和自己的努力学习下，很快就学会了铺铁轨、扶气钻（开山机）、架电线、安装电灯等带技术性的工作。从此使我认识到治淮工地同时又是一座教育人民的好课堂。每个参加治淮的人们，只要虚心努力学习，就会学得许多新知识。我看到工人农民的互相学习精神，又使我深刻体会到工农联盟的伟大力量和新中国建设的美丽远景。
    沿淮农民感谢毛主席
    石漫滩水库已胜利完工，淮河沿岸的人民已高兴地唱起：淮河湾，淮河长，淮河两岸是稻粮；蒋匪帮，害人狼，扒开黄河把人伤；毛主席，共产党，你的恩情似爹娘；分了地，得解放，治好淮河乐洋洋。
    这是人民唱出内心喜悦的歌子。八月中旬，我同七八个同志乘车离开水库返回开封的时候，在汽车急驶中，回头南望，看到四个月以前还是一片荒凉山谷，现在已修起了一座崭新的水库。沿路到处都可看见一望无际的丰满的即将成熟的庄稼，到处呈现一片丰收的景象。我的脑子里不时呈现出中国今后水利建设上的光辉前景。
