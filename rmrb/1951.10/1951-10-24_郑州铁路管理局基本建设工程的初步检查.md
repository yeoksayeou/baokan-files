    Preliminary Inspection of Basic Construction Projects of Zhengzhou Railway Bureau
    Liu Jianzhang, Director of Zhengzhou Railway Bureau
    Our bureau's lines were repaired and opened to traffic in 1949, and basic construction began in 1950. Thanks to the state's huge investment and the efforts of all employees, the lines have been renewed, ensuring improved transportation efficiency and boosting employee morale. However, due to insufficient understanding of the political significance of basic construction and a lack of an overall concept, we have suffered from a purely task-oriented viewpoint and an eagerness for quick success, resulting in many errors and waste. The 1949 water tower case is a clear example. This year, after reading the People's Daily editorial "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design" and the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's "Notice on Strictly Inspecting Engineering Designs for Basic Construction," and after repeated instructions from the Ministry of Railways, we became more deeply aware of the seriousness of these errors and our responsibility for state property. Therefore, our bureau, on the one hand, arranged for relevant departments to study the documents, and on the other hand, organized inspection teams to go deep into the field to conduct publicity and education. We also absorbed design engineers, construction technicians, and administrative cadres from branch bureaus, sections, and teams to conduct relatively in-depth and systematic inspections, research, and self-criticism on various specific issues, and then proposed improvement measures.

    Problems Existing in Our Bureau's Basic Construction
    and the Root Causes
    (1) Planning: Since 1950, our basic construction projects have had plans, but they are generally not thorough or accurate, and some are extremely hasty and do not conform to economic principles.
    When formulating plans, the emphasis is on the needs of the department, without mutual cooperation, or excessively demanding standardization, hoping for a one-time solution, lacking realism. For example, the newly built coal platform at the Xinyang Locomotive Depot exceeded the actual needs of the locomotives in that depot by a factor of two. Some stations have built new freight warehouses, but without corresponding tracks. Some stations have plans to extend tracks, but without the necessary demolition and construction plans for culvert extensions, gatehouses, signals, water cranes, ash pits, etc. Some projects have been completed but have not yet been used. For example, the Wulipu flag station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway has had its tracks and houses completed long ago, but because it has not yet been opened, the turnouts have had to be dismantled to avoid danger. The main reasons for these phenomena are: (1) Our bureau lacks comprehensive and correct guidance on basic construction projects, and neglects the comprehensive nature of railway enterprises. Railway enterprises must develop in a balanced manner in all departments in order to fully utilize the effective functions of the equipment. Any single, outstanding development is a great waste in itself. (2) The Planning Department was not established until the first half of 1950, and there was no unified planning organization; the Planning Department was initially established in the second half of 1950, but its role was not significant. Therefore, the formulation of plans by various departments formed a phenomenon of each acting on its own. (3) Some engineering personnel have remnants of colonial thinking and blindly worship some equipment standards of imperialist countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. They have not deeply realized that in the past, the reactionary ruling class borrowed money and materials from imperialist countries to build railways, which was actually to promote their materials. Today, the new People's China has broken away from its colonial and semi-colonial status and must work hard to build a family, rely on its own efforts, and engage in construction according to the state's financial resources and actual needs, distinguishing between priorities.
    The decision-making process lacks a developmental perspective. Under the new management policies and business guiding ideology, the staff and workers of the People's Railways have fully demonstrated their enthusiasm and creativity, and labor productivity has continuously improved. However, we underestimate the potential capacity of employees and equipment. We lack foresight regarding the development and changes in the New Democratic economy. Some equipment was urgently needed at the beginning of the plan, but after completion, it was useless or of little use. Some units have departmentalism thinking, and when the tasks of their section have changed and the originally planned equipment is no longer needed, they still do not return the allocated funds to the superior or voluntarily propose a reduction in their request. For example, the locomotive depots in Anyang, Shangqiu, and Shanzhou were repaired in 1950 and many auxiliary equipment were added, but currently there are few tasks. Another example is the Jiang'an Bridge Factory, which has completed its historical task and should be prepared to merge with the Zhengzhou Factory under the principle of economic accounting. However, when renovating and demolishing tracks in 1950 and 1951, the factory failed to reduce the old factory buildings, but instead requested the continued construction of new factory buildings. These conservative ideas and departmentalism have caused waste of state property.
    Each unit requests basic construction investment not based on its own basic construction capacity (including design, materials, labor, compilation of technical documents, etc.), but based on its subjective desires to ask superiors for money. The more money requested, the better. As for whether the task can be completed or whether there is waste, little consideration is given. Therefore, when formulating annual plans, the Bureau competes with the Ministry of Railways for investment, and the branch bureaus and user departments compete with the Bureau for investment. When the task is not completed or difficulties arise, they blame each other. The user department accuses the construction department, "Why can't you complete the task? You are responsible." The construction department accuses the user department, "The plans and requirements you proposed are incorrect and there are too many changes, so the task cannot be completed. You are also responsible." In the end, there are only two options: one is to "change the national system and plan," and the other is to "act hastily." In August 1950, in order to rush to complete some projects, the Party, government, trade union, and youth league all started working together. After five months of work, the basic construction funds retained accounted for nearly one-third of the total investment. More than nine months have passed in 1951, and if our leadership still does not pay attention, we will inevitably repeat the mistakes of last year.
    (2) Design: Although most of the basic construction projects in 1950 had designs, there were many problems:
    Designers do not go to the site and lack investigation, research, and preparation; labor and material rates are not verified and determined, resulting in blind construction and waste. In 1950, this situation was even more serious due to the eagerness for quick success. The drawings for many warehouses, ticket offices, and water tower projects have been prepared, but the location has not yet been surveyed and determined. Therefore, during construction, it was discovered that the foundation soil was poor, and it was necessary to increase the foundation or add piles. The Zhengzhou Branch Bureau even temporarily held soil load tests. This upside-down work method not only delays progress but also wastes man-hours. Regarding the stress of materials, because the engineering specifications are incomplete and the strength test data is insufficient, and because the old experience and habits are continued, a relatively conservative safety factor is intentionally adopted in the design, and the budget is overestimated. The estimated price of the Hankou Branch Bureau's 1950 project was 20% higher than the contractor's bid. Generally, the selection of materials is not valued, such as using stone instead of brick where stone is produced, and using red tiles instead of blue tiles where blue tiles are produced, thus wasting transportation capacity and increasing the material loss rate. The main reason for these errors is that there is a relatively serious employee mentality among the technical personnel, so they lack a sense of responsibility. Some engineering personnel ask "Is there money?" before designing. If there is no money, they cannot design; when there is money, they cannot immediately design it, resulting in chaos. Because they do not do preparatory work in peacetime, they can only copy things from foreign books in sets. They do not study the stress and production of domestic materials, and the designs they make are neither practical nor waste state resources.
    Insufficient contact between designers and user departments, neglecting usage efficiency. Some engineers do not consider what difficulties may be encountered during use and how to maximize its efficiency when designing. The doors and windows of the Zhengzhou staff dormitory all open outwards, which are easily broken by strong winds. Some user departments failed to promptly propose usage conditions or their own plans, which also affected the thoroughness of the design. For example, the houses of power plants in Baoji, Xinyang, and other places still have a large gap because they do not know the size and shape of the machines; the size of the chimney is unknown, and it can only be designed and constructed after the boiler and machine arrive. These errors are mainly caused by the lack of an overall concept and the emphasis on mechanical division of labor among the relevant departments.
    (3) Construction issues. The main problems in construction are:
  Construction personnel lack a sense of responsibility, resulting in waste. Some problems in the design are exposed during the construction process. If the construction personnel take responsibility and actively put forward suggestions for improvement, errors and waste can be avoided or reduced, but many construction personnel have not done so. Some projects have improper locations, incorrect heights, or poor foundations, and the construction personnel have not studied them with a responsible attitude and proposed corrections, resulting in losses to the project. Some construction personnel excessively cater to the incorrect opinions of users, adding a window here and a wall there, resulting in chaos and waste.
    Some speculative contractors cut corners and reduce materials during construction, resulting in waste. In 1950, most of the basic construction civil engineering and construction projects were contracted to private merchants, and fewer were self-managed. We implemented mass supervision for projects contracted to private merchants, which achieved some results. However, there are still some unscrupulous contractors who delay, procrastinate, and construct carelessly, affecting the quality and completion time of the project. There are even individual management personnel and technical personnel who embezzle and accept bribes by contracting out projects. Although the engineering tasks were urgent last year, the main reason for these wastes is still that we do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of basic construction projects and lack a high degree of responsibility for the people's property.
    Arbitrary construction without approval. In 1950, the focus of the project was on the restoration of bridges and lines, and less funds were allocated to building and station equipment. However, because the stations along the line were severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs before liberation, the objective needs were urgent, and the planned budget was inaccurate. After most of the bridge and line projects were completed in the third quarter, some of the construction materials and funds were still remaining, so more station buildings, employee housing, and supporting projects omitted from the original design were built. Although some of these projects were approved by the Bureau and the branch bureaus, and some were also reported to the Ministry for record, they have not been formally approved. This is a violation of laws and disciplines, and a manifestation of departmentalism and guerrilla tactics.
    We feel deeply about the seriousness of the above situation. Although each department has its own responsibilities for these problems, the main reason is that our leadership has a serious idea of "large-scale supply system, not accounting for the completion of tasks," lacks comprehensive and thorough planning, and lacks a high degree of responsibility for state property.
      Future Direction of Efforts
    In order to do a good job in basic construction in the future, we must accept the above experiences and lessons, establish a clear guiding ideology and strict discipline under the general policy of national economic construction, strengthen the sense of responsibility of staff and workers as masters, so that they can earnestly do a good job in planning and design, and ensure the correct realization of the design during construction, so as to fully utilize the effectiveness of state resources.
    (1) When making plans, we must foresee the prospects of business development and take into account the cooperation between departments. To this end, all departments must eliminate the departmentalism thinking that disregards the overall situation, and the subjective-ism style of blindly asking for money without proceeding from reality or making up funds without urgent need. The plan must be based on the two conditions of necessity and possibility, taking into account both the long-term plan and the needs of reality.
    (2) In order to prevent the phenomenon of "building a car behind closed doors," designers must go to the site. After the annual engineering plan is approved, responsible cadres and some designers from various departments should be organized to form a group to conduct on-site surveys and research on various issues related to construction design.
    (3) For the calculation of labor and material rates and the stress of domestic materials, we must try to collect existing data for research. The main and commonly used domestic materials should be tested and determined as standards for the future.
    (4) Strengthen the unity and education of technical personnel, enlighten their class consciousness and the idea of being masters, improve their political and business level, and break the conservative thinking and employee mentality.
    (5) Continue to implement some of the good systems that were tried out in 1950, such as the mass supervision system and the roving inspection system, and mobilize employees to create new systems and methods in their work.
    (6) Abide by the government's laws and systems, and adhere to the principle that "construction cannot be carried out without engineering design."

    郑州铁路管理局基本建设工程的初步检查
    郑州铁路管理局局长  刘建章
    我局所属线路于一九四九年抢修通车，一九五○年开始基本建设。由于国家的巨额投资及全体员工的努力，线路面目一新，保证了运输效率的提高，并鼓舞了职工劳动热情。但由于我们对基本建设的政治意义认识不够，缺乏整体观念，存在着单纯任务观点与急于求成思想，因而发生的错误与浪费很多。一九四九年水塔案件就是一个显明例证。今年六月我们见到人民日报发表的“没有工程设计就不可能施工”的社论和政务院财政经济委员会“关于严格检查基本建设工程设计的通知”，又经铁道部多次指示以后，更深刻地警觉到这些错误的严重性，和我们对国家财产所应负的责任。因此，我局一方面布置有关部门学习文件，一方面组织检查组深入现场进行宣传教育；并吸取分局科、段设计工程师、施工技术人员及行政干部，就各项具体问题进行比较深刻地有系统地检查研究与检讨，然后提出改进办法。
    我局基本建设中所存在的问题
    与错误的根源
    （一）计划方面：自一九五○年起，我们的基本建设工程虽有计划，但一般的不周密、不确实，有的极其草率，不合乎经济原则。
    在订计划时强调本部门需要，不互相配合，或过分要求标准化，希图一劳永逸，缺乏现实性。如信阳机务段新修的煤台，超过了该段机车实际需要的一倍。有的车站新建了货物仓库，但无相应的股道。有的站有延长股道的计划，而没有涵洞加长及闸房、信号、水鹤、灰坑等必要的拆迁与兴建计划。有的工程已完，至今尚未使用。如京汉线五里堡旗站，股道与房屋早已完工，因尚未开站运用，只好将道岔拆除，以免危险。造成这些现象的主要原因是：（1）我局对基本建设工程缺乏通盘地正确地指导，忽略了铁路企业的综合性。铁路企业必须各部门平衡发展，才能充分发挥设备的应有效能。任何一点单独突出发展，本身就是一个极大浪费。（2）一九五○年上半年计划处未成立，没有统一的计划机构；一九五○年下半年计划处初成立作用不大，因此各部门制订计划形成各自为政现象。（3）部分工程人员存在着殖民地思想残余，盲目崇拜英、美、法、日等帝国主义国家的一些设备标准。他们没有深刻认识到过去反动统治阶级向帝国主义国家借款借料修筑铁路，实际上是替它们推销物资，今天人民新中国已经摆脱了殖民地半殖民地的地位，必须刻苦兴家，自力更生，根据国家财力与实际需要，分别轻重缓急，从事建设。
    决定问题时缺乏发展观点。在新的管理方针与业务指导思想下，人民铁路的职工群众充分发挥了积极性和创造性，劳动生产率不断提高。但我们对职工及设备的潜在能力却估计不足。对于新民主主义经济的发展变化缺乏预见性。有些设备在计划之初，迫切需要，但建成以后，反无用或无大用。有些单位存有本位主义思想，当本段任务已经变更，原计划设备已不需要时，仍不将已经分配的款额缴回上级或自动提出减少的意见。如安阳、商邱、陕州三机务段机车库于一九五○年修复并添了不少附属设备，而目前任务很少。又如江岸桥梁厂已经完成了它的历史任务，在经济核算原则下，应即准备与郑州厂合并。但该厂在一九五○年与一九五一年改拆股道时未能将旧厂房作部分的缩小，反而要求继续兴建新厂房。这些保守思想与本位主义，造成了国家财产的浪费。
    各单位不根据自己的基本建设能力（包括设计、材料、劳动力、技术文件的编制等）请求基本建设投资，而根据自己的主观愿望向上级要钱。钱要得越多越好，至于能否完成任务，有无浪费，就不大考虑。因此在订年度计划时，管理局向铁道部争投资，分局及各使用部门向管理局争投资，当任务完不成或发生困难时，就互相埋怨，使用部门责备施工部门“为什么完不成任务，责任由你负”，施工部门又责备使用部门“提的计划和要求不正确，变更多，因而完不成任务，责任你们也要负”。最后只有两条出路：一是“变更国家的制度和计划”；一是“草率从事”。一九五○年八月某些工程因争取赶工，有关党、行政、工会、青年团一齐下手，忙了五个月，结果保留下来的基本建设工程款几占全部投资的三分之一。一九五一年已经过去了九个多月，假如我们领导上仍不注意，必然重蹈去年的覆辙。
    （二）设计方面：一九五○年各项基本建设工程虽大部有设计，但存在的问题很多：
    设计者不到现场，缺乏调查研究和准备工作；工率料率未经核算查定，盲目施工，形成浪费。一九五○年工程因急于求成，此种情形更为严重。很多仓库、票房、水塔工程图样已经制妥，而地位尚未勘查确定。因此在施工时发现地基土质不良，不得不加大基础或加桩。郑州分局办公室甚至临时举办土壤载重试验。此种本末倒置的工作方法，既延误进度，又浪费工时。关于材料应力问题，因为工程规范不全，强度试验资料不够，加以延用旧的经验习惯，在设计时，有意采用了比较保守的安全率，多估预算。汉口分局一九五○年工程估价有较包商投价高百分之二十者。对用料选择一般也不重视，如出产石料的地方，不用石代砖；出产青瓦地方，却要采用红瓦，因此浪费运输力并增大材料耗损率。造成这些错误的主要原因是技术人员中存在着比较严重的雇佣观点，因而责任心不强。有的工程人员在设计之前，先问“有钱没有”，没有钱就不能设计；等有了钱又不能立即设计出来，因而形成手忙脚乱。因为他们平时不做准备工作，结果只有成套地搬用外国书上的东西。他们对国产材料应力及生产情况也不加研究，所做设计既不实用，又浪费国家资财。
    设计者与使用部门联系不够，忽略使用效率。有些工程师设计时不考虑使用时可能遇到什么困难，怎样才能发挥它的最大效率等等。郑州员工宿舍门窗都向外开，大风一吹极易折断，有些工程使用部门未能及时提出使用条件或本身计划，也影响设计不够周密。如宝鸡、信阳等地发电所房屋，因为不知道机器尺寸形态，直到现在还留着一个大缺口；烟囱尺寸不知道，只有等到锅炉机器到齐后才能设计施工。这些错误主要是由于有关部门缺乏整体观念，强调机械分工所造成。
    （三）施工问题。施工方面的主要问题是：
  施工人员责任心不强，以致造成浪费。设计中的问题，有些在施工过程中就暴露出来，如果施工人员负起责任，主动提出改进意见，是可以避免或减少错误与浪费的，但很多施工人员都没有这样做。某些工程地位不当，高度不对，或地基不良，施工人员都没有以负责的态度，加以研究，提出改正，致使工程受到损失。也有些施工人员过分迁就使用者的不正确的主张，东加一个窗，西加一堵墙，造成混乱与浪费。
    某些投机包商在施工中偷工减料，造成浪费。一九五○年基本建设土木建筑工程，包与私商者居多，自办较少。包与私商的工程，我们实行了群众性的监工，曾收到一些成绩。但仍有些不良包商，拖延扯皮，施工草率，影响工程质量及完工时间。甚至有个别管理人员与技术人员，借发包工程贪污受贿。虽然去年工程任务紧迫，但造成这些浪费的主要原因，还是我们对基本建设工程的重要性认识不够，对人民财产缺乏高度的责任心。
    未经批准任意施工。一九五○年工程重点在桥梁、线路的修复，工款支配在建筑和站场设备方面较少。但因沿线各站解放前遭受蒋介石匪帮的严重破坏，客观需要迫切，加上计划预算不准确，到第三季度桥梁线路工程大部完成后，工料款仍有部分剩余，所以就多做了些站房、员工住房及原设计上漏列的配合工程。这些工程有的虽经管理局与分局批准，有的也曾呈部备案，但均未得到正式批准。这是违法乱纪的行为，是本位主义、游击作风的表现。
    以上情况，我们深感严重。对这些问题，各部门虽各有责任，但主要是由于我们领导上存在着严重的“大供给制，完成任务不算账”的思想，缺乏全盘周密的计划，及对国家财产高度的责任心。
      今后努力方向
    为了做好今后基本建设工作，必须接受以上经验教训，在国家经济建设的总方针下，树立明确的指导思想与严格的纪律，加强工作人员主人翁的负责精神，使能认真做好计划设计工作，并于施工时保证设计的正确实现，以充分发挥国家资财的效能。
    （一）做计划时必须预见到业务发展前途，顾及部门间的配合。为此，各部门必须清除不顾整体的本位主义思想，与不从实际出发盲目要钱，或没有急需硬凑款额的主观主义作风。计划必须根据必要与可能两个条件，既要照顾百年大计，又要合乎现实需要。
    （二）为了防止“闭门造车”的现象，设计者必须到现场。在年度工程计划批准以后，应组织各部门负责干部及若干设计人员，成立小组，到现场实地勘察，调查研究有关施工设计的各种问题。
    （三）对于工料率的计算，国产材料的应力，要尽量搜集现有的资料加以研究。主要的常用的国产材料，并需予以试验及查定，作为今后的标准。
    （四）加强对技术人员的团结教育，启发其阶级觉悟与主人翁思想，提高其政治与业务水平，打破保守思想雇佣观念。
    （五）继续贯彻一九五○年度所试行的一些良好制度，如群众性的监工制度、巡回检查制度等，并发动职工在工作中创造新的制度与方法。
    （六）恪守政府的法令与制度，坚持“没有工程设计不能施工”的原则。
