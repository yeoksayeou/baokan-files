    Hoping All Contributors Will "Fight to Eliminate Typos in Newspapers"
    To the Editor:
    I completely agree with the criticism of the poor work style of some newspaper staff in the article "Fight to Eliminate Typos in Newspapers" in the "Cultural Life" column of the People's Daily on October 14th. Our newspapers are powerful weapons for conducting ideological education among the broad masses of people. Every political error caused by typos can have a negative impact on people's ideology and politics. Therefore, I believe that not only should newspaper editors and reporters pay attention to this issue, but also newspaper correspondents and all contributors should pay close attention to this issue. In the past, when writing articles, I often wrote very carelessly, which caused great difficulties for editors, typesetters, and proofreaders. In the future, in addition to ensuring that I correct this problem, I also hope that newspaper correspondents and all contributors will jointly "fight to eliminate typos in newspapers"!

### 希望一切投稿者都能“为消灭报纸上的错字而斗争”

    希望一切投稿者都能“为消灭报纸上的错字而斗争”编辑同志：
    我完全赞成十月十四日人民日报“文化生活”栏“为消灭报纸上的错字而斗争”一文对某些报纸工作人员的恶劣作风的批评。我们的报纸，是对广大人民群众进行思想教育的有力武器，每一个因错字而造成的政治性的错误，都可能对人民思想上政治上发生不良的影响。因此，我认为不仅报纸的编辑、记者应该重视这个问题，各报的通讯员和一切投稿者，也应该十分注意这个问题。我个人在过去写稿时，也常常写得很潦草，这就给编辑、排字工人、校对人员增加了很大困难。今后我除保证纠正这个毛病外，也希望各报的通讯员和一切投稿者，共同“为消灭报纸上的错字而斗争”！
