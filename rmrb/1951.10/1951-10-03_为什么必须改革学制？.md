The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has announced the decision on the reform of the school system. This is entirely suitable for the actual situation and needs of the People's Republic of China. It is based on the New Democratic education policy stipulated in the Common Program, draws on the experience of people's education in our country (mainly education in the old revolutionary base areas), criticizes the old school system left over from old China, and formulates a new school system necessary for the construction of new China.

The new school system will completely eliminate the malpractices of the old school system. In the new school system, the cadre schools and various training classes and spare-time schools for workers and peasants have gained their due status; primary schools implement a five-year consistent system, abolishing the two-level system of junior primary and senior primary schools with a six-year study period, which facilitates the majority of working people, especially the children of peasants, to receive complete primary education; various technical schools urgently needed for cultivating talents for national construction are included in the formal school education system, and necessary systems are established; various school education can be connected with each other in the entire education system, forming a broad road for people's education from primary education to higher education. This new school system will undoubtedly facilitate the advancement of the people's education cause in new China, facilitate the improvement of the cultural and scientific level of the people of our country, and facilitate the large-scale cultivation of talents needed for various construction undertakings in our country. Although this new school system still inevitably carries a transitional nature, it is in line with the current situation and needs of our country. This new school system will be gradually implemented throughout the country from 1952, in a planned and focused manner, according to specific circumstances.

Why must we reform the school system? Why must the old school system be eliminated, and the new school system be implemented? Why does the new school system still inevitably carry a transitional nature, but it is necessary for the Chinese people today?

The school system is a reflection of the development of social production and the state of scientific development. To what extent social production and scientific conditions have reached and can reach determines what kind of school system is needed. In the education systems of various eras and societies, there are different school systems. The school system of capitalist countries is a reflection of capitalist production, which adapts to the requirements of bourgeois monopoly economy; the school system of socialist countries is a reflection of socialist advanced production methods, which adapts to the ever-increasing socialist and communist construction requirements. The old Chinese school system, copied from the school systems of capitalist countries, reflected the reactionary ideas of the landlord, bureaucratic-comprador bourgeoisie of a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society, and was contrary to the actual needs of the Chinese people. The working people had no rights or status in the culture and education of old China. If we recall, in the two-level primary schools of the old system, how many children of the working people, especially the children of peasants, had the opportunity to receive complete primary education? Were they not always ridiculed as being "both poor and ignorant"? The old school system did not allow training classes and spare-time schools for workers and peasants to occupy a proper position, nor did it recognize the proper position of various technical schools in the education system and the necessity of establishing a certain system for them. That is to say, under the old school system, the working people who occupied an important position in social production were excluded, and social production activities and various practical needs were not fully reflected in school education, and education and actual life were often far apart. If we continue to maintain this old school system, it is equivalent to not wanting a cultural revolution.

We have always advocated reforming the old school system. During the domestic revolutionary war and the war of resistance against Japan, in various revolutionary base areas, we continuously established various new types of schools according to actual needs, breaking the old school system and gradually creating a new school system. After the Chinese people's revolution achieved nationwide victory and the People's Republic of China was founded, the two types of school systems, new and old, actually had to coexist temporarily. The original schools in the vast newly liberated areas temporarily maintained the old school system, which was beneficial to the step-by-step transformation of old education; at the same time, the people's governments at all levels have held a large number of worker-peasant cadre schools, various spare-time schools and training classes in the past two years, which is absolutely necessary. However, as the revolutionary and construction undertakings of the people of our country further develop, in order to make our school education universally and closely integrated with the actual needs of revolution and construction, the reform of the school system has become an urgent matter. We must train a large number of talents needed for the construction of new China in the shortest possible time, and train cadres of various social components; to meet the demands of the vast working people, first of all workers and peasants, so that they can universally improve their culture, master technology, and learn the ability to manage and build the country, we must implement the new school system. This is to establish the Chinese people's own school system based on the development of the New Democratic political economy, based on the state of social production division of labor in our country and the continuously improving requirements.

One of the most distinct features of the new school system is reflected in its reform of the primary school system. The old system of six-year primary school divided into two levels, so that 90 percent of primary school students nationwide could not receive complete primary education. The new system of primary school abolished the two levels and merged them into one level, shortening the time by one year, which guarantees that the children of all working people in cities and villages can enjoy equal opportunities for complete primary education.

The new school system has determined the status of various forms of cadre schools, spare-time schools and training classes. This ensures the education of workers and peasants and the re-education of old intellectuals and general staff; it ensures that these schools can supply a large number of cadres in the future and invest them in various construction undertakings of the country.

The new school system has determined the status of various technical schools in the entire school system, and has established and improved the systems of these schools, making various technical schools interconnected. This guarantees that tens of thousands of workers and peasants can enter junior technical schools from primary schools and spare-time schools; and it also guarantees that they can enter secondary technical schools from junior high schools, and connect with various vocational schools. This not only allows technical education to better combine with practice, but also allows technical education to maintain its continuity in the entire school education system.

These basic features of the new school system demonstrate that it is one of the important steps to develop people's education by revolutionary means.

Since our country is still in a revolutionary period, in a period when a large number of cadres need to be trained by accelerated methods, and because of the imbalance in economic and cultural development in various places, our school system inevitably has a transitional color, and the steps of this transitional school system reform must also have differences. Premature uniformity and immature reforms are harmful and should be opposed. But on the other hand, with the development of national construction undertakings, the progress of social production division of labor, and the improvement of the people's cultural level, after a considerable period, the school system of our country will certainly develop towards a more strict and orderly direction, which is also certain. Because we cannot imagine that without formal school education, we can cultivate talents that meet strict needs. Facts have proved that all ideas and practices that deny the importance of school education, school systems and examination systems, advocate abolishing school systems and examination systems, unilaterally emphasize life experience without paying attention to systematic knowledge and theoretical learning are wrong, and the results are all failures. We must also firmly oppose this erroneous tendency. In the process of implementing the new school system, we must launch such a two-front struggle to ensure the complete realization of the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the reform of the school system.

### 为什么必须改革学制？

    为什么必须改革学制？
    中央人民政府政务院关于改革学制的决定公布了。这是完全适合于中华人民共和国现实的情况和需要的。它根据了共同纲领所规定的新民主主义教育政策，吸取了我国人民教育（主要的是老革命根据地的教育）的经验，批判了旧中国所遗留下来的旧学制，制订了为新中国建设所必需的新学制。
    新学制将完全革除旧学制的弊害。在新学制中，工人、农民的干部学校和各种训练班、补习学校取得了应有的地位；小学实行五年修业的一贯制，取消初小和高小两级修业六年的分段制，便利于广大劳动人民尤其是农民的子女能够受到完全的初等教育；各种为培养国家建设人才所急需的技术学校被列入了正规的学校教育系统之内，并建立了必要的制度；各种学校教育在整个教育系统中都能够互相衔接，从初等教育到高等教育，形成了人民教育的一条康庄大道。这个新学制无疑地将便利于推进新中国的人民教育事业，便利于提高我国人民的文化和科学水平，便利于大量培养我国各项建设事业所需要的人才。这个新学制虽然还不能不带着过渡的性质，但它是切合我国目前的情况和需要的。这个新学制从一九五二年起，将在全国各地，按照具体情况，有计划、有重点地逐步推行。
    为什么我们必须改革学制？为什么旧学制非革除不可，新学制非实行不可？为什么新学制还不能不带着过渡的性质但它又是今天中国人民所必需的呢？
    学制是社会生产发展和科学发展状况的反映。社会生产状况和科学状况已经达到和能够达到什么样的程度，就需要有什么样的学制。在各个时代、各种社会的教育系统中，都有各自不同的学制。资本主义国家的学制是资本主义生产的反映，它适应于资产阶级垄断经济的要求；社会主义国家的学制则是社会主义先进生产方法的反映，它适应于日益高涨的社会主义和共产主义建设的要求。旧中国的学制，抄袭了资本主义国家的学制，反映了殖民地半殖民地半封建社会的地主官僚买办资产阶级的反动思想，与中国人民的实际需要相违背。劳动人民在旧中国的文化教育上是没有权利、没有地位的。我们回想一下，在旧制的两级小学中，有多少劳动人民的子女，特别是农民的子女能够受到完全的初等教育的机会呢？他们不是永远被讥笑为“既贫且愚”的吗？旧学制不允许为工人、农民举办的训练班和补习学校占有正当的地位，也不承认各种技术学校在教育系统中的正当地位和建立它的一定制度的必要。这就是说，在旧学制之下，居于社会生产中的重要地位的劳动人民反而是受排斥的，社会生产的活动和各种实际需要在学校教育中得不到充分的表现，教育和实际生活常常是距离得很远的。对于这种旧的学制，如果我们继续加以维持，就等于不要文化革命。
    我们从来是主张改革旧学制的。在国内革命战争时期和抗日战争时期中，我们在各个革命根据地，都按照实际的需要，不断地举办了各种新型的学校，打破了旧学制，逐渐创立了新的学制。在中国人民革命取得全国胜利、中华人民共和国成立以后，新旧两种学制实际上不能不暂时并存。广大新解放区原有的学校，暂时维持旧学制，对于有步骤地改造旧教育是有好处的；同时各级人民政府两年来大量举办了工农干部学校、各种补习学校和训练班，更是完全必要的。但是，当我国人民的革命和建设事业进一步发展的时候，为了使我们的学校教育普遍地与革命和建设的实际需要紧密结合起来，学制的改革就成为迫不及待的事情。我们要在最短的时间培养出新中国建设所需要的大批人才，培养出各种社会成份的干部；要满足广大劳动人民，首先是工人和农民的要求，使他们普遍地提高文化、掌握技术、学会管理与建设国家的本领，就必须实行新学制。这就是依据新民主主义政治经济的发展，依据我国社会生产分工的状况和不断提高的要求，确立中国人民自己的学校系统。
    新学制的最鲜明的特点之一，表现在它对小学校学制的改革。旧制的六年小学分为两级，使全国小学生有百分之九十得不到完全的初等教育。新制的小学取消了两级，合为一级，时间缩短一年，这就保证了城市和城村一切劳动人民的子女都能够享受完全初等教育的平等机会。
    新学制确定了各种形式的干部学校、补习学校和训练班的地位。这就保证了对工人、农民的教育和对旧知识分子及一般工作人员的再教育；保证了这些学校在今后能够大量供应各种干部，投入国家的各种建设事业中去。
    新学制确定了各种技术学校在整个学校系统中的地位，并且建立和健全这些学校的制度，使各种技术学校互相衔接。这就保证了成千成万的工人、农民能够从小学、业余补习学校走进初级技术学校；也保证了他们能够从初级中学走进中等技术学校，并且同各种专科学校衔接起来。这不但可以使技术教育更好地结合实际，而且可以使技术教育在整个学校教育系统中保持它的连续性。
    新学制的这些基本特点，表现了它是用革命办法来发展人民教育的重要步骤之一。
    由于我国还处在革命时期，处在需要用速成方法训练大批干部的时期，并且由于各地经济文化发展的不平衡，我们的学制不可避免地要带有过渡的色彩，而且这种过渡性的学制改革的步骤也不能不有参差的地方。过早的整齐划一和不成熟的改革是有害的，应当反对的。但是另一方面，随着国家建设事业的发展、社会生产分工的进步和人民文化水平的提高，我国的学制经过相当时期之后，又一定会向更加严格和整齐的方面发展，这也是可以肯定的。因为我们不能设想，没有正规的学校教育，能够培养出合乎严格需要的人才。事实证明，一切否认学校教育、学校系统和考试制度的重要性、主张取消学校制度和考试制度、片面强调生活经验而不重视系统的知识和理论学习的想法和作法，都是错误的，其结果都是失败的。我们对于这种错误倾向同样要坚决加以反对。在新学制实行的过程中，我们必须展开这样的两条战线的斗争，来保证中央人民政府政务院关于改革学制的决定的完全实现。
