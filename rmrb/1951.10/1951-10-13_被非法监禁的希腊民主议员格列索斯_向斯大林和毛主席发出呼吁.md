Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 9th TASS: It has been learned here that Manolis Glezos, a hero of the Greek resistance movement and member of parliament, currently imprisoned in Averoff Prison, announced a hunger strike on October 8th. He sent telegrams to Stalin and Mao Zedong, as well as to Truman, Attlee, Auriol, the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, all representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the parliaments of the various People's Democratic countries, the parliaments and parliamentarians of the US, UK, France, Italy and India, the UN Secretariat, the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the International Federation of Journalists, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the Soviet newspaper *Pravda*, newspapers in China and the People's Democratic countries, *l'Humanité*, *l'Unità*, *Workers' Daily*, as well as *The New York Times* and *The Times*.

The telegrams sent by Glezos read as follows:

In the September 9th elections, I was elected as a member of parliament for the Athens constituency as a candidate of the "Left-Wing Democratic Alliance." I received 28,702 votes, which is three times the number of votes required for election. On October 2nd, the Court of First Instance issued ruling No. 9364-51, declaring me a member of parliament.

I am a fighter in the national resistance, and I participated in the Greek people's tireless struggle against the Hitlerite aggressors. I was sentenced to death for this during the Hitlerite occupation of Greece. Now, I have been imprisoned for three years for my political views under a death sentence. In the September 9th elections, the people voted for peace and demanded the restoration and establishment of normalcy in the country. Therefore, the people urgently demand that the government's administrative and judicial authorities release me and other elected people's representatives, so that we can freely and faithfully fulfill our duties as people's representatives in parliament. The people elected us as members of parliament, and the government should, in accordance with the constitution, comply with the provision that "arrested members of parliament should be released four weeks before the parliament convenes," and that "all members of parliament recognized by the Court of First Instance should immediately perform their duties as members of parliament and exercise the rights conferred by the constitution."

Despite the above provisions, I have not been released. Moreover, there are indications that the government does not intend to try my case, nor does it intend to try the cases of other arrested or exiled people's representatives who have been elected, namely, the already elected members of parliament, Sarafis, Gavriilidis, Hatzimichalis, Imvriotis, Mostrakis, Ambatielos, Tsouchas, and Iliou.

I appeal to you and to the public opinion of free people: please use your influence and do everything possible to ensure that the Greek Constitution and democratic principles are once again respected within Greece.

Elected Member of Parliament for the Athens Constituency, Glezos, in Averoff Prison

    被非法监禁的希腊民主议员格列索斯
    向斯大林和毛主席发出呼吁
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社雅典九日讯：此间获悉，目前被监禁在阿维罗夫监狱中的希腊抵抗运动英雄、国会议员曼诺里斯·格列索斯在十月八日宣布绝食，并致电斯大林和毛泽东，同时致电杜鲁门，艾德礼，阿里奥尔，苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院，苏联最高苏维埃全体代表，中国人民政治协商会议，各人民民主国家的议会，美、英、法、意、印各国议会和议员，联合国秘书处，联合国大会政治委员会，联合国人权委员会，国际新闻记者协会，国际民主法律工作者协会，苏联《真理报》，中国和各人民民主国家的报纸，《人道报》，《团结报》，《工人日报》以及《纽约时报》和《泰晤士报》。
    格列索斯发出的电报如下：
    在九月九日的大选中，我以“左翼民主联盟”候选人资格在雅典选区当选为议员。我获得二万八千七百零二张选票，等于当选所需选票的三倍。十月二日，初审法院颁布第9364－51号裁决，宣布我为议员。
    我是民族抵抗战士，我曾经参加了希腊人民反对希特勒侵略者的不息斗争。我曾为此而在希特勒匪军占领希腊期间被判处死刑。现在，我自从因为政治见解而被判处死刑以来，已入狱三年了。在九月九日的大选中，人民投票拥护和平，要求恢复并确立国内的正常局势。因此，人民迫切要求政府行政当局和司法当局释放我和其他当选的人民代表们，好使我们能够在议会内自由而忠实地尽我们做人民代表的职责。人民选我们做议员，照理政府就应该遵照宪法规定：“被捕议员应在议会开会前四周即予释放”，“凡为初审法院认可的议员，应即执行议员职务并行使宪法所赋予的权利”。
    尽管有上面这种规定，我却没有被释放。而且，有种种迹象表明：政府既不打算审理我的案件，也不打算审理其他被捕或被流放而已当选的人民代表们，即业已当选为议员的萨拉非斯、加维里利底斯、哈齐米哈利斯、伊姆弗里奥蒂斯、莫斯特尔基斯、阿姆巴泰洛斯、曹哈斯和伊路的案件。
    我向你们和自由人民的舆论界呼吁：请运用你们的影响，并尽一切可能，使希腊宪法和民主原则在希腊境内重新受到尊重。
