Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. All employees of the Civil Aviation Administration of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government presented a "National Day" aircraft to Chairman Mao as a National Day gift. The aircraft has been refurbished and a grand naming ceremony was held at an airport in Shanghai on the morning of the 29th. During the solemn presentation ceremony, Wu Kejian, Secretary-General of the East China Military and Political Committee, accepted the "National Day" aircraft on behalf of Chairman Mao and cut the ribbon.

At the same time as presenting the aircraft, all employees of the Civil Aviation Administration wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting to Chairman Mao that in the past year, all employees of the Civil Aviation Administration had repaired and built brand new "National Day" and "China Youth" passenger planes and ten C-46 transport planes from the pile of broken aircraft abandoned by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The letter said: "These achievements can only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party. These achievements have greatly strengthened our confidence in building a new China's civil aviation industry!"

The "National Day" aircraft is a beautiful passenger plane that can safely fly for eight thousand hours. This aircraft was rushed to repair by the employees of the Shanghai Branch of the Civil Aviation Administration's Mechanical Repair Factory in just over a month, using the dilapidated cargo planes left by the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    民用航空局全体工人职员向毛主席献“国庆号”飞机
    【新华社上海三十日电】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会民航局全体员工给毛主席的国庆节献礼——“国庆号”飞机已经装修完成，并于二十九日上午在上海某机场举行了隆重的命名典礼。在庄严的献礼仪式中，华东军政委员会秘书长吴克坚代表毛主席接受“国庆号”飞机并剪彩。
    民航局全体员工于献机同时，并写信给毛主席，向毛主席报告一年来民航局全体员工从国民党反动派所抛弃下来的破烂飞机堆中，已修造好了崭新的“国庆号”、“中国青年号”两架客机和十架Ｃ——４６运输机的成绩。信中说：“这些成绩只有在共产党的领导下才能获得。这些成绩大大加强了我们建设新中国民航事业的信心！”
    “国庆号”飞机是一架优美的客机，可安全航行八千小时。这架飞机是民航局机械修理厂上海分厂的职工们，利用国民党反动派遗留下来的残破货机，化一个多月工夫赶修而成的。
