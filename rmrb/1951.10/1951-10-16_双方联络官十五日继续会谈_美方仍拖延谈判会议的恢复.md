Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 15th: On October 15th, liaison officers from both sides continued talks to discuss the resumption of meetings between the two delegations. The liaison officer of the United Nations Command delegation continued to refuse to enter into a discussion of the specific date and time for the resumption of the armistice negotiation meetings, delaying the resumption of the negotiation meetings. The liaison officer of our side sternly pointed out that the other side's delaying tactic was groundless. Our commander has continuously proposed the resumption of negotiations since September 19th, but due to various obstructions from the other side, the negotiations have not yet been resumed. The responsibility lies entirely with the other side. The liaison officer of our side once again suggested that both sides should immediately enter into a discussion of the specific date and time of the resumption based on the agreement already reached regarding the resumption of the delegation meetings. The meeting ended at 1:00 PM and is scheduled to continue at 10:00 AM on October 16th.

    双方联络官十五日继续会谈
    美方仍拖延谈判会议的恢复 【新华社开城十五日电】十月十五日双方联络官继续会谈洽商双方代表团复会事宜。联合国军代表团联络官仍然拒绝进入停战谈判会议的具体复会日期与时间的讨论，拖延谈判会议的恢复。我方联络官严词指出对方此种拖延办法是毫无理由的，我方司令官自九月十九日起即不断提出恢复谈判的主张，但由于对方的各种阻挠，谈判至今未能恢复，其责任完全属于对方。我方联络官再度建议双方应在关于代表团复会事宜已有协议的基础上立即进入具体复会日期与时间的讨论。会议在下午一时结束，订于十月十六日十时继续举行。
