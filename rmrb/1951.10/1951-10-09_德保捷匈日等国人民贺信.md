[Report from this newspaper] The All-China Esperanto Association recently received 49 letters to our government and people from factories, enterprises, groups and individuals in countries such as the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Japan, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland and Belgium, warmly congratulating our National Day. In these letters, they warmly hailed the great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace. They unanimously expressed great excitement about the tremendous achievements of our country in the two years since its founding, showed infinite respect and love for Chairman Mao, the great leader of our people, and expressed admiration and respect for the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting against American imperialist aggressors in Korea.

The letter from the Peace Committee of the Ruppin District of the German Democratic Republic stated: "Due to the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the world peace camp under the leadership of Marshal Stalin has become stronger and more powerful. It will surely be able to crush all aggressive attempts and ensure a better life for peace-loving humanity." The Ruse City Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front said in a congratulatory letter: "The Bulgarian people are watching with joy the heroic struggle of the Chinese people to crush imperialism and defend lasting peace." Václav Bašek, the secretary of the Pilsen District Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, pointed out in his letter: "The epoch-making victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the reactionaries and imperialist interventionists has indeed greatly changed the situation of the world peace and democracy camp and the camp of reactionary warmongers." J. Ernő and ten other staff members of the National Bank of Hungary in Budapest wrote in their letter: "Our paths are the same, and we are very happy to be able to work and fight together with the people of the glorious Comrade Mao Zedong in the powerful peace camp headed by the Soviet Union." The Executive Committee of the Prague District of the Czechoslovak National Front said in a letter: "Only together with the Soviet Union led by Comrade Stalin and China led by Comrade Mao Zedong can all people's democratic countries defend world peace, and they certainly will." They have infinite confidence in the strength of the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army and the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers. The letter from Mr. Brabec, the director of the famous Skoda factory in Czechoslovakia, said: "Your people's army is now monitoring the American and British warmongers side by side with the Soviet army that liberated us, defending the peaceful construction of our fraternal countries."

Kiyoshi Matsumoto, the chairman of the Kyoto Student Esperanto Association of Japan, said in his letter that the victory of the Chinese people has inspired the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian people. He wrote: "Today, October 1st, is not only a festival for you Chinese people, but also a festival for all of us Asian people." He then stated that the Japanese people firmly oppose the US signing a separate peace treaty with Japan and the conspiracy to rearm Japan and enslave the Japanese people. He said: "We peace-loving Japanese people will never stop the anti-fascist struggle!" "We Japanese youth will never fight against our Asian brothers!"

In addition, there are letters from A. Brookfield of London, England, the "Solidarity Society" of Esperanto-speaking workers in Finland, the Stockholm Esperanto Peace Committee in Sweden, and Esperantists and Esperanto groups such as L. Wallebroeck in Brussels, Belgium.
