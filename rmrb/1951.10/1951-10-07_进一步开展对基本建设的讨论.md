    Further Develop the Discussion on Basic Construction
    Cui Zhong
    Since the People's Daily systematically exposed some chaotic phenomena in basic construction and analyzed and criticized some erroneous ideas, it has had a significant impact on our work. The Ministry of Heavy Industry and its affiliated enterprise management departments and various factories and mines have all begun organized research and inspection of basic construction since July. From the existing materials, it can be seen that some ideological issues have been more clearly understood or initially resolved among leading cadres and technical personnel, thereby improving work. However, some new problems and other deviations have also been discovered, thus requiring further discussion on basic construction issues.
    The main reflections on the criticisms of the People's Daily can be summarized as follows: (1) Recognizing the shortcomings in past work, striving to improve work, and making progress, but feeling a lack of methods and requiring further assistance and resolution of some difficulties. (2) Generating a tendency to fear criticism and not dare to take responsibility. Several examples:
    To illustrate the problem, let me list the following facts: (1) A new factory, because it had a small portion of old foundations, some people advocated designing and constructing at the same time. After a long period of debate, consensus was reached in the July discussion, affirming the principle that construction can only begin after the design is completed. (2) A factory adding important machines, the machine base was designed by an engineer from another place, requiring 18-foot-long, 18-inch-thick steel-reinforced concrete piles. The factory leader asked another engineer to review this design, raised different opinions, and invited several experts to study in detail and discuss it with the original designer. Finally, they unanimously agreed to change to wooden piles. Although the repeated discussions took two months, a correct design was obtained. This project was originally scheduled to be completed in December this year and test-run next spring. The person in charge of the project still dared not start construction after the design and drawings were completed, and requested to revise the plan to extend the completion date by one year, that is, to test-run in December next year. The reasons given were the delay in the foundation design (actually two months) and the difficulty of winter construction (in fact, not all construction cannot be carried out, machine installation can still be done). (3) The foundation plan for another important machine in a factory was completed, and the factory submitted it to the bureau for approval. The bureau wanted to report it to the ministry for filing, and the design drawings were shelved in the bureau for two months without approval. Finally, the factory director decided to start construction. (4) Serious errors occurred in the design of a factory building and its internal equipment. The designer was a well-known engineer. After months of discussion on the problems in the design, the original designer always resisted admitting the errors, claiming "I can pay compensation, but I cannot admit the mistake!" What ideological problems have been solved?
    The basic principle that construction cannot begin without a correct design has been affirmed. The People's Daily editorial on June 16 ("Construction is impossible without engineering design") has been firmly remembered by many people and is often cited as a basis for discussion. Examples one and two above show that leading cadres have implemented this principle in their work.
    The concept of strengthening investigation and research and opposing subjectivism is also clearer. Example two above shows that leading cadres adopted a method of repeated research in deciding on an important design, thereby correcting deviations and avoiding construction difficulties and waste.
    The eagerness for quick results has been significantly corrected. Examples one and two above both show improvements in this regard, but at the same time, another deviation has emerged. Pay attention to new deviations
    An atmosphere of fear of criticism has grown in some people, which has led to a tendency to delay plans and be unwilling to take responsibility. It can be seen from examples two and three above that some engineering and technical personnel already have this tendency. Some people simply understand the principle of "steady progress" as "slower," and thus extend the plan excessively without basis. This is from the same origin as the idea of increasing the safety factor in design materials. Some even deny the plan, advocating "doing it and seeing," and it will be considered completed when it is done, so there will be no result of failing to complete the plan! Another engineering example of a factory, originally scheduled to be completed in September, then changed to October, then to the end of the year, and then requested to be changed to next year. In essence, it is best not to have a plan! The error of this emotion lies in accommodating difficulties, rather than taking a proactive attitude to overcome difficulties. In addition, individual people even want to retreat!
    This tendency is basically an irresponsible or not actively responsible attitude towards the people's cause. Therefore, we can understand that the hired-labor ideology criticized by the People's Daily has not been properly resolved among some people. On the contrary, it has had another form of development. Therefore, this ideology and the irresponsible attitude arising from non-hired-labor ideology should continue to be criticized. Other ideas that need to be discussed
    The "face" problem. Example (4) above illustrates the harmfulness of this problem. In the old society, some engineering personnel who once had higher status or reputation still attached great importance to "face." Even if things are obviously wrong, even errors within the scope of common sense, they resolutely refuse to admit and express correction, thinking that admitting mistakes and correcting mistakes is too shameful, and he "cannot afford to lose face," thinking that a firm denial of mistakes can maintain his "prestige." This attitude is obviously wrong, hindering one's own progress and harming the people's cause. Therefore, strengthening political study and carrying out criticism and self-criticism is very important among these people.
    Regarding the tendency to neglect politics. First, the concept of regarding basic construction as a serious political task still needs to be implemented. The basic content of this concept is to recognize that every measure of basic construction is directly related to national defense issues and national economic issues. Therefore, any basic construction must proceed from an overall perspective. However, there are still people who emphasize that we cannot yet have planned construction and should give play to the independent activity of departments (and even enterprises). They still advocate that the state only manages appropriations and does not need to control the plan. Second, the view of relying on the masses to do a good job in basic construction is not yet clear. Like the attitude of some leading cadres to blindly trust engineering and technical personnel, some comrades think that they are laymen and arbitrarily think that workers cannot participate in the planning, design, and construction problems of basic construction, so they blindly rely on the design and construction contracts of several engineers, thinking that things are guaranteed with a contract. They do not pay attention to the opinions of employees. For example, the issue of a factory using broken brick and lime soil to build foundations is not suitable for northern conditions, but the employees repeatedly opposed it and were not adopted. As a result of the construction, the project was not strong. Third, the policy thinking is not clear. This is an extremely serious and harmful phenomenon in the current work, mainly manifested in the implementation of the state's basic construction policies and decisions. One situation is not seriously studying the policy, so it is impossible to master and implement it. For example, the Interim Measures for Basic Construction Work Procedures promulgated by the Central Finance and Economics Committee this spring should be our most basic guiding principle for basic construction, but many comrades in charge of basic construction work have not seriously studied and understood this document, but kept it as an archive for reference! If some measures cannot meet the actual work situation, they can only be revised to meet the actual situation through serious study and implementation. The other is not seriously implementing the state's decisions. For example, the decision of the Central Finance and Economics Committee on handling unfinished basic construction projects and remaining funds in 1950 has not been seriously implemented in some units. Some were in a hurry to find ways to spend the money after knowing that this decision was about to be issued, buying things that should not be bought, and paying for things that should not be paid, to prevent the funds from "returning to the state." Fourth is a pure economic point of view. Some engineering personnel have a fairly serious tendency in this regard. They are unwilling to work in state agencies, but prefer to open their own offices. Individual people also take a speculative attitude, nominally accepting state leadership, but essentially doing their own business, contracting design for profit, and if they are not able to do so, they draw sketches and construct, which eventually leads to serious errors after construction. A certain example has not yet been resolved, and the project is still in abnormal use! They do not consider how to be responsible for the people's cause, but still use the methods of the old society to achieve their own certain attempts.
    Regarding the supply system ideology, it still exists. For example: Regarding the attitude towards the budget, not regarding the budget as a specific plan for work, but simply as a basis for asking the superior for money, so the budget is not made based on the technical design, and the budget is not properly grasped. As a result, changes in plans and changes in engineering projects occur constantly, making the budget lose its practical significance. Furthermore, the phenomenon of misappropriation of production funds and basic construction funds still exists. Some comrades think that doing so can do more things or do them faster, but in fact, it is not. The result of misappropriation causes confusion in financial management and stockpiling of materials, so that the efficiency of the two funds cannot be utilized in a planned way. Requirements for improving basic construction work
    The actual working situation shows that whether the guiding ideology is correct directly affects the completion of the basic construction task. Therefore, continuing to overcome the various ideological obstacles that still exist and preventing certain ideological deviations that may occur should be the basic link in improving basic construction. Some errors that have already occurred in basic construction and the various difficulties that continue to exist are certainly expressed in many different forms, such as inadequate planning and design, untimely supply of materials, chaotic financial management, uncoordinated cooperation of work departments, deviations in construction management, unsound labor organization, unclear division of labor and responsibilities, and unsound various systems. In the final analysis, our organization and leadership of basic construction still have shortcomings. Any basic construction task is related to the work of the enterprise (executing department) and its leadership departments at all levels. Therefore, whether the basic construction task can be completed cannot be simply understood as the responsibility of one aspect of the executing department. From this, it can be seen that the reason why there are certain errors in basic construction, from a comprehensive perspective, cannot only be the result of work deviations on one aspect of the executing department, but must also involve the work of certain leadership departments. The inspection report of the Ministry of Heavy Industry on basic construction shows that in order to further do a good job in basic construction, we should carry out all possible and necessary improvements from enterprises to leadership departments at all levels. Therefore, the current requirements of various enterprises for improving basic construction work are not limited to discussions on certain issues, but should gradually involve all work of basic construction. For this reason, it is necessary to select representative units for basic construction, conduct a more systematic and comprehensive investigation and research, and examine all our work from the reflection of various specific facts. For example, the implementation and effectiveness of important decisions guiding basic construction, the specific reasons for the various ideological deviations and study how to seek improvement from the organization and methods in addition to correcting them from understanding, according to the existing problems, distinguish which are the problems of the enterprise itself, which are the problems of its leading organs, and research specific plans for improving work that can be realized. In short, in order to more effectively improve basic construction work, we should immediately combine the actual situation of all work for in-depth and specific discussions. Therefore, it is hoped that the People's Daily will further develop the discussion and research on basic construction.

    进一步开展对基本建设的讨论
    崔中
    人民日报有系统地揭发了基本建设中若干混乱现象，并对某些错误思想进行了分析批判之后，已在我们的工作中，发生了重大的影响。重工业部及其所属企业管理部门和各厂矿，均自七月份开始了有组织地对基本建设的研究和检查。从已有的材料可以看出某些思想问题在领导干部和技术人员中已经有了比较明确的认识或得到初步的解决，并由此改进了工作，但同时又发现了若干新的问题与另一方面的偏差，因之需要对基本建设问题作进一步的讨论。
    对人民日报批评的主要反映，可以概括为以下两点（一）认识了以往工作中的缺点，努力改进工作，并已有进步，但深感办法少要求进一步的帮助和解决若干困难。（二）产生了害怕批评和不敢负责的倾向。几个例子
    为了说明问题，先列举以下几件事实：（一）某新建厂，因有一小部分旧基础，于是有人主张一面设计一面施工，曾经长时间争论，在七月份讨论中认识才趋一致，肯定了设计完成后才能施工的原则。（二）某厂增设重要机器，机座由外地工程师设计，需打十八尺长十八寸粗钢筋洋灰桩。该厂负责人请另一工程师审查此项设计，提出不同意见，又请数专家详细研究并去与原设计者讨论，最后一致同意改打木桩，曾因反复讨论费时两个月却获得了正确设计的结果。此项工程原定今年十二月完工，明春试车，主持工程的负责人在设计、图样均已完备后仍不敢开工，并要求修改计划，将完工期延长一年，即在明年十二月试车，理由为地基设计拖延（实为两个月）和冬季施工困难（实则并全部不能施工，机器安装仍可进行）。（三）某厂另一重要机器地基计划完成，厂呈局批准，局要报部备案，设计图样在局搁置了两个月未批，最后由厂长决定动工。（四）某厂厂房及其内部设备在设计上发生严重错误。设计者为一有名望之工程师。设计中之问题经过了数月的讨论，原设计者始终抵触不承认错误，声言“赔钱可以，认错不能”！解决了什么思想问题
    没有正确设计不能施工，这一基本原则是被肯定了。人民日报六月十六日社论（“没有工程设计就不可能施工”），已被许多人牢牢记在心中，每一讨论，均被熟习的提为依据。上述一二两例说明领导干部已在工作中贯彻这一原则。
    加强调查研究，反对主观主义这一概念，也较明确，上述第二例，看出领导干部在决定一个重要设计上采取了反覆研究的作法从而纠正了偏差，避免了施工上的困难与浪费。
    急欲速成的情绪，有了显著的纠正，上述一二两例均表现了这一方面的改进，但同时却产生了另一偏向。注意新的偏向
    在一部分人中滋长了害怕批评的情绪，并由此产生了拖延计划，不愿负责的倾向。从上述二三两例中可以看出，某些工程技术人员已有此种倾向。某些人把“稳步前进”的方针简单地理解为“慢一点”，于是无根据地过多地延长计划，这和在设计用料上加大保险系数的思想同一根源。甚或否定计划，主张“做着看”办成算数，就不致有完不成计划的结果了！某厂另一工程例子，原计划九月完成，后改十月，再改年终，又要求改到明年，实质上是顶好不定计划！这种情绪的错误在于迁就困难，而不是采取积极克服困难的态度。此外个别人甚至要打退堂鼓了！
    这种倾向基本上是对人民事业不负责或不积极负责的态度，因之我们可以理解，人民日报所批评的雇佣思想在某些人中还没有得到应有的解决，相反地又有了另一种形式的发展，因之对于这种思想以及非雇佣思想所产生的不负责态度应继续批判。需要讨论的另几种思想
    “面子”问题。上述（四）例，说明这一问题的为害性。在旧社会里某些曾有较高地位或名望的工程人员，还是十分重视“面子”的，事情明明错了，甚至属于常识范围的错误，也坚不承认和表示改正，以为认错改错太丢脸，而他是“丢不起脸的”，以为以坚决否认错误的态度就可以保持他的“威望”。这种态度显然是错误的，既妨碍自己的进步，又为害人民的事业，因之加强政治学习，开展批评和自我批评在这些人中甚为重要。
    关于忽视政治的倾向。第一，把基本建设视作严重的政治任务的概念尚须贯彻。这一概念的基本内容就是要认识基本建设的每一措施都直接涉及国防问题和国家经济问题，因之进行任何基本建设都必须从整体观点出发，但目前还有人强调我们还不可能有计划的建设，应当发挥部门的（以至企业的）独立活动性，他们依然主张国家只管拨款而不必控制计划。第二，依靠群众办好基本建设的观点还不明确，像某些领导干部对于工程技术人员盲目信任的态度，有的同志以为自己外行并且武断地以为工人不可能参与基本建设的计划、设计和施工问题，因而盲目地依赖几个工程师的设计施工合同，以为有了合同事情就有保证了，对于职工的意见则不重视。例如某厂采用碎砖三合土打地基问题，并不适合北方的条件，职工一再反对却未采纳，施工结果工程不坚固。第三是政策思想不明确，这一点是目前工作中极其严重而有害的现象，主要表现在对于国家关于基本建设方针和决定的执行上，一种情况是不认真研究方针，因之也就不能掌握方针和贯彻执行。例如中央财政经济委员会在今春发布的基本建设工作程序暂行办法，应是我们进行基本建设的最基本的指导方针，但我们许多负责基本建设工作的同志，并未认真研究和体会这一文件，而把它作为档案备查了！如果说某些办法尚不能符合实际工作情况，也只有认真研究和执行中才能得到合乎实际的修正。另一种则是不认真执行国家的决定，例如中央财政经济委员会关于处理一九五○年度基本建设未完工程及剩余资金的决定，在某些单位中就未认真执行，有的在知道要发布这一决定后，却是赶紧设法把钱用出去，不该买的东西买了，不该给钱的付了，以防资金“回笼”。第四是单纯的经济观点，有的工程人员，有相当严重的这种倾向，他们不愿在国家机关中工作，而宁愿自己开事务所，个别人还采取投机的态度，名义上接受国家领导，实质上办自己的事，包揽设计唯利是图，力所不及则草图施工，终至在施工后发生了严重的错误，某一实例迄今尚未解决，该项工程仍处非正常的使用中！他们不考虑如何对人民事业负责，仍然以在旧社会时的作法以达个人的某种企图。
    关于供给制思想，目前依然存在，例如：对于预算的态度，不把预算视作工作的具体方案，而单纯作为向上级要钱的依据，因之不根据技术设计作预算，不正确掌握预算，结果改变计划改变工程项目就不断发生，使预算失掉实际意义。再如生产资金和基本建设资金的流用现象仍然存在，有的同志以为这样做可以多办一些事，或办快一些，其实却不然，流用的结果造成财务管理上的混乱，和器材供应上的积压，使两种资金的效率都不能有计划地发挥。对改进基本建设工作的要求
    实际工作情况说明，指导思想是否正确，直接影响基本建设任务的完成，因之继续克服仍然存在的各种思想障碍和防止可能发生的某些思想偏差，应是改进基本建设的基本环节。基本建设中所已经发生的某些错误和继续存在的各种困难，固然以许多不同形式表现出来，如像计划设计不周，物资供应不及时，财务管理混乱，工作部门配合不协调，施工管理有偏差，劳动组织不健全，分工与职责不明，以及各种制度不健全等等，归根结底是我们对于基本建设的组织领导还有缺点。任何一项基本建设任务都关系到企业（执行部门）及其各级领导部门的工作，因之基本建设任务之能否完成，就不能仅仅理解为是执行部门一个方面的职责问题，由此可知基本建设之所以有某些错误，从全面讲也不可能仅仅是执行部门一方面发生工作偏差所致，而必然地要涉及到某些领导部门的工作。重工业部关于基本建设的检查报告，说明为了进一步做好基本建设工作，应当是从企业到各级领导部门进行各种可能的和必要的改进，因此目前各企业对于改进基本建设工作的要求，就不仅仅限于在某几个问题的讨论上，而应是逐步地涉及到基本建设的全部工作。为此有必要选择有代表性的进行基本建设的单位，做一番比较系统的全面的调查研究，从各种具体事实的反映，考察一下我们的全部工作。譬如，指导基本建设的重要决定的执行情况及其效果，各种思想偏差产生的具体原因并研究其除从认识上纠正之外，应如何从组织上办法上求得改进，根据目前存在的问题，分清那些是企业本身的问题，那些是其领导机关的问题，并由研究出可能实现的改进工作的具体方案。总之为了更有效地改进基本建设工作，应即结合全部工作的实际情况作深入的和具体的讨论，因之希望人民日报进一步开展对基本建设的讨论和研究。
