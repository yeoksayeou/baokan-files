    Self-Criticism Regarding Epidemic Prevention Propaganda Work

    To the Editors:

    On August 29th, the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page published Comrade Li Ming's criticism of our epidemic prevention propaganda work. At the time, it didn't attract our attention until the newspaper sent a letter. This is an irresponsible attitude towards work and the people. After investigating the situation of Doctor Sun not providing explanations or propaganda to the masses during the epidemic prevention vaccination work, and instead adopting a coercive and commanding attitude, we found that it was basically true. The occurrence of this incident demonstrates our careless and bureaucratic work style. We only made arrangements usually, but didn't conduct inspections, therefore we didn't understand what problems existed in the work. As for Doctor Sun, we will help him conduct a self-criticism and make a plan to improve future work.

### 获嘉县人民政府卫生科  关于防疫宣传工作的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    关于防疫宣传工作的检讨编辑同志：
    八月二十九日人民日报“读者来信专页”上登了黎明同志对我们的防疫宣传工作的批评。当时，没有引起我们的注意，直到报社来信以后，才派人前往调查。这是一种对工作、对人民不负责任的态度。关于孙医生在进行防疫注射工作时，不向群众进行解释、宣传，反而采取强迫命令的恶劣态度等情况，经我们调查，基本上都是事实。这件事情的发生，说明了我们的粗枝大叶和官僚主义的工作作风，平时只有布置，没有进行检查，因此不了解工作中有些什么问题。至于孙医生，我们将帮助他进行检讨，并作出改进今后工作的计划。
