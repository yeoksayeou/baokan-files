[Our Dispatch] The first volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," published under the auspices of the Publishing Commission of the Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was published by the Beijing People's Publishing House and will be distributed by Xinhua Bookstores throughout the country starting today.

The "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" collects the important works of Comrade Mao Tse-tung from the five historical periods experienced by the Communist Party of China since 1926, and are edited in the order of the year and month of the works. All articles in the Selected Works have been reviewed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, and the Publishing Commission of the Selected Works has made some title explanations and annotations.

The "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" is a collection of Comrade Mao Tse-tung's achievements in applying the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution, and its publication is an important event in the cause of Marxism-Leninism.

Volume One of the "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" contains the works of Comrade Mao Tse-tung during the First Domestic Revolutionary War and the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, with a total of sixteen articles, nine of which have not been included in the several "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" published in the past.

This Selected Works includes two articles by Comrade Mao Tse-tung during the First Domestic Revolutionary War (also known as the Great Revolution of 1924-1927, or the Northern Expedition):

"Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan."

In the article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out that the industrial proletariat is the leading force of the Chinese revolution, analyzed the enemies and friends of the Chinese revolution, and put forward the strategic idea that the Chinese proletariat must unite with the vast majority (mainly the peasants) against the minority, explaining the political contradictions of the national bourgeoisie and its intention to "establish a state ruled by the national bourgeoisie as a class" "is completely unfeasible" and "is merely a fantasy." This article by Comrade Mao Tse-tung has formed the fundamental idea of a new democratic revolution of the people led by the proletariat, which is a Marxist-Leninist idea that is completely contrary to Chen Duxiu's capitulationism towards the bourgeoisie.

In "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," Comrade Mao Tse-tung described and summarized the various experiences of the peasant revolution at that time and the various results it achieved in the revolution, enthusiastically praised the revolutionary creation of the masses, supported the political power created by the masses themselves, and pointed out that all imperialist and feudal forces would be buried in the grave by the peasant revolution, and all political parties would be tested and decided by the revolutionary peasants. This work is an open and complete split between Bolshevism represented by Comrade Mao Tse-tung and Menshevism represented by Chen Duxiu at the critical juncture of the Great Revolution, manifested by the prominent issue of the peasant revolution, and it was the latter's capitulationism that prevented the revolution from defeating the Kuomintang right-wing counter-revolution and led the Great Revolution to failure.

This Selected Works includes fourteen articles by Comrade Mao Tse-tung during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War (also known as the period of Kuomintang reaction and the Ten-Year Civil War, or the Land Revolution), namely: "Why is it that Red Political Power Can Exist in China?", "The Struggle in Jinggang Mountains," "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," "Pay Attention to Economic Work," "How to Differentiate the Classes in the Rural Areas," "Our Economic Policy," "Be Concerned with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism," "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "Statement on Chiang Kai-shek's Statement," "The Tasks of the Chinese Communist Party in the Period of Resistance to Japan," "For the Mobilization of All the Nation's Forces for Victory in the War of Resistance," "On Practice."

After the revolution of 1924-1927 was betrayed by the Kuomintang counter-revolutionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, who colluded with imperialism to carry out a bloody purge, the problem facing the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China was how to preserve the vital forces of the revolution, re-establish revolutionary bases, and prepare for a new great revolution and its victory. This was an extremely complex environment and an extremely serious period. A small number of capitulationists headed by Chen Duxiu during the Great Revolution became Trotskyites and degenerated into counter-revolutionaries. However, Comrade Mao Tse-tung combined the necessary retreat with bases and the possible new offensive with bases when the revolution failed, leading our Party to march towards the rural areas where the counter-revolutionary forces were weaker. In the historical document "Why is it that Red Political Power Can Exist in China?", Comrade Mao Tse-tung made a brilliant analysis of the political and economic characteristics of semi-colonial and semi-feudal China: "The various factions of new and old warlords supported by imperialism and the comprador landlord class have been waging continuous wars against each other since the first year of the Republic of China, which is one of the characteristics of semi-colonial China." And "the reason for this phenomenon is twofold: the local agricultural economy (not a unified capitalist economy) and the imperialist policy of dividing and exploiting spheres of influence." Based on this analysis, Comrade Mao Tse-tung concluded: "We only need to know that the split and war of the white regime in China is continuous, then the emergence, existence and increasing development of the red regime is undoubted." Based on this analysis, Comrade Mao Tse-tung determined that armed struggle should be the main form of revolutionary struggle and that the revolutionary strategy should be to encircle the cities from the countryside and then seize the cities, and that the expansion of the revolutionary area should adopt a wave-like advance policy, opposing rash advance policies.

"The Struggle in Jinggang Mountains" is an extremely important historical document on building the People's Liberation Army and building revolutionary base areas. In this work, Comrade Mao Tse-tung described the general political situation at that time and the development of the specific revolutionary armed struggle, vividly depicting how the revolutionary retreat after the failure of the 1924-1927 revolution turned into a new revolutionary offensive in the rural areas, solved various specific problems discovered in the revolutionary struggle at that time, and criticized the excessively left-leaning errors committed by some comrades in actual policies.

The document "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" (i.e., the first part of the "Resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Red Army") played a significant role in the history of building our Party and building the People's Army. In this document, Comrade Mao Tse-tung, based on the characteristics of China as an agricultural country dominated by small-scale production, criticized various non-proletarian biases reflected in the Party and proposed methods of correction, solving many basic problems in the construction of the Chinese Communist Party, and also solving many basic problems in the construction of the Chinese People's Army.

"A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" is Comrade Mao Tse-tung's further theoretical explanation of the establishment and development of revolutionary base areas and popular revolutionary regimes, taking the establishment of revolutionary base areas and revolutionary regimes as the starting point for a new great revolution. Comrade Mao Tse-tung analyzed a series of contradictions in China at that time to illustrate that the trend of "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" in the Chinese revolution was inevitable. "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" - this old Chinese saying is often used by Comrade Mao Tse-tung to explain and estimate the emerging forces and new things.

The question of whether the Red Army and the Red regime could exist and develop, answered by the two works "Why is it that Red Political Power Can Exist in China?" and "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," was a decisive theoretical question on the Chinese revolution after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, as Comrade Mao Tse-tung later recalled in his famous book "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War": "This is the most basic question. Without answering the question of whether the Chinese revolutionary base areas and the Chinese Red Army can exist and develop, we cannot move forward." This new question was posed to Marxists by a semi-colonial and semi-feudal great power, and this new question was solved by Comrade Mao Tse-tung based on China's independent experience. Two "left" opportunisms rejected Comrade Mao Tse-tung's Marxist-Leninist views, thus causing the revolution to suffer a lot.

In the article "How to Differentiate the Classes in the Rural Areas," Comrade Mao Tse-tung summarized the experience of the Chinese land revolution, resolved many disputes that arose in the analysis of rural class issues, and corrected erroneous tendencies in land reform work. This is one of the important historical documents on China's land reform.

"Our Economic Policy" put forward the policy of "carrying out all possible and necessary economic construction" in the revolutionary base areas, as well as the simultaneous development of state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and private enterprises. The basic road of economic development of the People's Republic of China has been initially outlined here by Comrade Mao Tse-tung.

The article "Be Concerned with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work" strongly put forward the fundamental viewpoint of all revolutionary workers serving the people, and made a scientific analysis and enthusiastic discussion of the ability of the people's strength to overwhelm everything.

"On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism" is the theoretical basis for our Party's proposal of the anti-Japanese national united front. This historically significant work by Comrade Mao Tse-tung is completely different from the class-analysis-free proposals and attitudes of some comrades in the Party at that time regarding the united front issue. Comrade Mao Tse-tung brilliantly analyzed the new changes in China's internal class relations and the relations between imperialist countries in the face of Japanese aggression, pointed out the possibility of a broad anti-Japanese national united front and the new situation created by the Long March of the Chinese Red Army, refuted the infantile disorder of closed-doorism and pessimism, and at the same time put forward the necessity of a strong proletarian-led revolutionary center force to avoid the mistakes of the Party's opportunist line in 1927, which did not strive to expand the main force of the revolution but only relied on the then ally, the Kuomintang. This work made many important provisions for the class composition and general policy of the People's Republic.

"Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" - this is a summary of the experience of the Ten-Year Civil War and the great debate on the erroneous line at that time, and at the same time a mental preparation for the strategic issues of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In this book, Comrade Mao Tse-tung analyzed the extremely complex war issues based on China's social, economic, and political conditions, explained the law of revolution and revolutionary war from small to large and from weak to strong, and refuted the "left" opportunism that denied the retreat necessary under certain conditions for preparing for an offensive (which Comrade Mao Tse-tung called "luring the enemy deep"), believing that such an error was a very stupid error. This book is essentially not only a Marxist scientific work on the strategic issues of war, but also a Marxist scientific work on the issues of political tactics and ideological methods.

"The Tasks of the Chinese Communist Party in the Period of Resistance to Japan" was written when the anti-Japanese national united front was initially transformed from possibility to reality. Comrade Mao Tse-tung raised the issue of proletarian leadership in the united front in this way: "Should the proletariat follow the bourgeoisie, or should the bourgeoisie follow the proletariat? This question of the responsibility of the Chinese revolution is the key to the success or failure of the revolution." After opposing the infantile disorder of closed-doorism, this question became the fundamental issue for Comrade Mao Tse-tung to fight against the new capitulationist thinking in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

Comrade Mao Tse-tung's philosophical work "On Practice" was written in July 1937. This work comprehensively, profoundly, and popularly explained the Marxist-Leninist theory of knowledge. In this work, Comrade Mao Tse-tung analyzed the philosophical nature of the disputes within the Party during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War and, based on the principles of materialism, exposed the dogmatic errors and empiricist errors in the ideological methods of the "left" and right-leaning elements. Comrade Mao Tse-tung's work not only laid the foundation for the Marxist-Leninist education of the Chinese Communist Party, but also enriched and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of knowledge with the Party's extremely rich combat experience over a long period of time.

    马克思列宁主义事业中的重要事件
    毛泽东选集第一卷出版
    选集中的各篇文章都经过毛泽东同志校阅
    全国各地新华书店自今天起开始发行
    【本报讯】由中共中央毛泽东选集出版委员会主持出版的“毛泽东选集”，其第一卷已由北京人民出版社出版，自今日起由全国各地新华书店发行。
    “毛泽东选集”收集了毛泽东同志从一九二六年以来在中国共产党所经历的五个历史时期的重要著作，一律按照著作年月的次序编辑。选集中的各篇文章，都经过毛泽东同志的校阅，并由选集出版委员会作了一些题解和注释。
     “毛泽东选集”是毛泽东同志应用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说解决中国革命问题的成果的汇集，它的出版是马克思列宁主义事业中的重要事件。
    “毛泽东选集”第一卷是毛泽东同志在第一次国内革命战争时期和第二次国内革命战争时期的著作，共计论文十六篇，其中九篇是过去出版的几种 “毛泽东选集”中没有编入过的。
    毛泽东同志在第一次国内革命战争时期（也即大家平常所称的一九二四年至一九二七年大革命时期，或北伐战争时期）的著作，本选集编进两篇：
    “中国社会各阶级的分析”与“湖南农民运动考察报告”。
    在“中国社会各阶级的分析”这篇文章里面，毛泽东同志指出了工业无产阶级是中国革命的领导力量，分析了中国革命的敌人和友人，提出了中国无产阶级必须联合最大多数（主要是农民）反对少数的战略思想，说明民族资产阶级的政治矛盾及其关于
    “实现民族资产阶级一阶级统治的国家”的企图“是完全行不通的”，“仅仅是一个幻想”。毛泽东同志这篇文章已形成了关于无产阶级领导的人民大众的新民主主义革命的根本思想，这是和陈独秀的对资产阶级的投降主义完全相反的马克思列宁主义的思想。
    在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中，毛泽东同志描写和总结了当时农民革命的各方面经验及其在革命中所达到的种种结果，热烈歌颂群众的革命创造，拥护群众自己所创造起来的政治权力，指出了一切帝国主义和封建势力都将被农民革命葬入坟墓，而一切政党都将在革命的农民面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。这篇著作是毛泽东同志所代表的布尔塞维主义和陈独秀所代表的孟塞维主义处在大革命的紧急关头、由农民革命这一个突出的问题表现出来的公开的与完全的分裂，而正是后者的投降主义使革命不能够击破国民党右派的反革命，把大革命引到失败的路上。
      毛泽东同志在第二次国内革命战争时期（也即大家平常所称的国民党反动与十年内战时期，或土地革命时期）的著作，本选集编入十四篇，即：“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”，“井岗山的斗争”，“关于纠正党内的错误思想”，“星星之火，可以燎原”，“必须注意经济工作”，“怎样分析农村阶级”，“我们的经济政策”，“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”，“论反对日本帝国主义的策略”，“中国革命战争的战略问题”，“关于蒋介石声明的声明”，“中国共产党在抗日时期的任务”，“为争取千百万群众进入抗日民族统一战线而斗争”，“实践论”。
    在一九二四年至一九二七年革命被以蒋介石、汪精卫为首的国民党反革命派背信弃义，勾结帝国主义加以血洗之后，摆在中国人民和中国共产党面前的问题，是要如何保存革命的有生力量，从新建立革命的阵地，准备新的大革命及其胜利。这是一个极复杂的环境与极严重的时期。以陈独秀为首的一小部分在大革命时期的投降主义者变成了取消派，并与托洛茨基派相结合，堕落为反革命。但是，毛泽东同志则把革命失败时所必需的有阵地的退却与可能的有阵地的新进攻结合起来，领导我们党向反革命力量较弱的农村进军。在“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”这一个历史的文件里面，毛泽东同志对于半殖民地半封建的中国政治经济的特点，作了英明的分析：“帝国主义和国内买办豪绅阶级支持着的各派新旧军阀，从民国元年以来，相互间进行着继续不断的战争，这是半殖民地中国的特征之一。”而“这种现象产生的原因有两种：即地方的农业经济（不是统一的资本主义经济）和帝国主义划分势力范围的分裂剥削政策。”根据这样的分析，毛泽东同志得到了结论：“我们只须知道中国白色政权的分裂和战争是继续不断的，则红色政权之发生、存在并且日益发展，便是无疑的了。”根据这样的分析，毛泽东同志确定了以武装斗争为革命斗争的主要形式和以乡村包围城市然后取得城市的革命方针，并确定了革命区域的扩大应该采取波浪式的推进政策，反对冒进政策。
  “井岗山的斗争”是关于建设人民解放军和建设革命根据地的一篇极重要的历史文件。毛泽东同志在这一个著作中，叙述了当时的一般政治形势和具体的革命武装斗争的发展，生动地描写了在一九二四至一九二七年革命失败后革命的退却如何在农村变成革命的新进攻，解决了当时革命斗争中所发现的各种具体的问题，批评了有些同志在实际政策上所犯的过左的错误。
   “关于纠正党内的错误思想”这一个文件（即“中国共产党红军第四军第九次代表大会决议案”的第一部分），在建设我们党和建设人民军队的历史上，曾起了重大的作用。毛泽东同志在这个文件里面，根据中国是小生产占优势的农业国家的特点，批评党内所反映的各种非无产阶级偏向，并提出纠正的方法，解决了中国共产党的建设的许多基本问题，同时也从而解决了中国人民军队的建设的许多基本问题。
    “星星之火，可以燎原”是毛泽东同志在理论上进一步地说明了关于建立和发展革命根据地和民众革命政权的问题，把建立革命根据地和革命政权作为新的大革命的出发点。毛泽东同志分析了当时中国一系列的矛盾，来说明中国革命的“星星之火，可以燎原”的趋势是不可避免的。“星星之火，可以燎原”——这句中国老话，时常被毛泽东同志用以说明和估量新生的力量，新生的事物。
    “中国红色政权为什么能够存在？”和“星星之火，可以燎原”这两篇著作所答复的关于红军和红色政权能否存在和发展的问题，是一九二七年大革命失败后在中国革命问题上具有决定意义的理论问题，正如毛泽东同志后来在“中国革命战争的战略问题”这部名著上所回忆过的：“这是一个最基本的问题，不答复中国革命根据地和中国红军能否存在和发展的问题，我们就不能前进一步。”这是半殖民地半封建的大国在马克思主义者面前提出的新问题，这个新问题是由毛泽东同志根据中国的独立的经验加以解决了。两次“左”倾机会主义拒绝毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的观点，因而使革命尝了不少苦头。
    在“怎样分析农村阶级”一文中，毛泽东同志总结了中国土地革命的经验，解决了在分析农村阶级问题上发生的许多争论，纠正了在土地改革工作中的错误的倾向。这是关于中国土地改革的重要历史文献之一。
    “我们的经济政策”提出了在革命根据地“进行一切可能的和必须的经济方面的建设”，以及国营事业、合作社事业和私人事业三方面同时进行的方针。中华人民共和国经济发展的基本道路，已被毛泽东同志在这里初步地刻划出来。
    “关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文，强烈地提出了一切革命工作人员为人民服务的根本观点，对于人民力量的能够压倒一切，作了科学的分析和热情的论述。
    “论反对日本帝国主义的策略”是我们党提出抗日民族统一战线的理论基础。毛泽东同志这篇有历史意义的著作，和当时党内有的同志关于统一战线问题的毫无阶级分析的提法和态度，完全区别出来。毛泽东同志杰出地分析了在日本的侵略面前中国内部的阶级关系与帝国主义国家间关系的新变化，指出了广泛的抗日民族统一战线的可能性和中国红军长征所造成的新局面，给关门主义的幼稚病和悲观主义以驳斥，同时提出了强大无产阶级领导的革命中心力量之必要，以避免一九二七年党内机会主义路线不努力扩大革命的主力军而只倚仗当时同盟者国民党的错误。这篇著作对于人民共和国的阶级构成及其大政方针，作出了很多重要的规定。
    “中国革命战争的战略问题”——这是一部关于十年内战经验以及对当时错误路线的大争论的总结，同时又是关于抗日战争的战略问题的思想准备。在这本著作中，毛泽东同志根据中国社会经济的政治的诸条件，分析了极端复杂的战争问题，说明了革命与革命战争从小到大、以弱胜强的规律，驳斥了那种否认在一定条件下为着准备进攻所必须的退却（当时毛泽东同志叫做“诱敌深入”）的“左”倾机会主义，认为那种错误乃是很大的愚蠢的错误。这本著作实质上不只是一本关于战争的战略问题的马克思主义的科学著作，而且是一本关于政治策略问题和思想方法问题的马克思主义的科学著作。
    “中国共产党在抗日时期的任务”是写在抗日民族统一战线由可能性初步变成现实性的时候。毛泽东同志这样提出关于统一战线中无产阶级领导权的问题：“使无产阶级跟随资产阶级呢，还是使资产阶级跟随无产阶级呢？这个中国革命领导责任的问题，乃是革命成败的关键。”在反对关门主义的幼稚病之后，这个问题在抗日战争中，就成为毛泽东同志和新的投降主义思想作斗争的根本问题。
    毛泽东同志的哲学著作“实践论”，写于一九三七年七月，这部著作全面地、深刻地而又通俗地解说了马克思列宁主义的认识论。在这篇著作里，毛泽东同志分析了第二次国内革命战争时期党内争论的哲学性质，根据唯物论的原理，揭露了“左”倾分子和右倾分子在思想方法上的教条主义错误和经验主义错误。毛泽东同志的这篇著作，不但奠定了中国共产党的马克思列宁主义教育的基础，而且以党在长时期中极其丰富的战斗经验，充实了和发展了马克思列宁主义的认识论。（附图片）
