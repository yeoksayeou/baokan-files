    Major Party Cadres of Guangdong Paper Mill Irresponsible
    Democratic Reform Progresses Extremely Slowly
    The democratic reform work at the Guangdong Paper Mill in Guangzhou has progressed slowly because Deputy Director and Party Branch Secretary Du Lun, and Supervisory Committee member Ye Wobo, have not paid enough attention and have been passively perfunctory, failing to properly mobilize the masses, so that a mass movement has failed to form.
    The main responsible persons of the Guangdong Paper Mill – Du Lun, Ye Wobo, and the Director Liu Baochen, etc. – have long been at odds, suspecting and shirking responsibility from each other when encountering problems. They each have varying degrees of bureaucratism. After the start of the democratic reform work, they continued to quibble over some old issues, so their thoughts and actions were not unified, and they did not take democratic reform as the central task that overrides everything. They even adopted a passively wait-and-see attitude toward the democratic reform work. In late May, although Du Lun had made a report to the staff on this issue, he did not formulate a concrete plan, let alone go deep to mobilize the masses. At the end of August, Huang Xichuan, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government's Industry Department, led a work team to the factory to assist in carrying out the democratic reform work, and according to the instructions of the CCP Guangzhou Municipal Committee, started from scratch, re-understanding the situation. Du Lun and Ye Wobo expressed dissatisfaction with this, believing that it completely negated the achievements of the past work. As a result, Du, Ye, and others became even more passive towards the democratic reform work, even resisting it. Du Lun was often late and left early for meetings, and rarely spoke. Both Ye and Du had the wrong idea of ​​"Let's see you (the work team) do it," and often satirized the work team, saying that the work team was "objectivist," and ridiculed the work team for "groping around, but still doing our stuff."
    However, the comrades of the work team continued to carry out their work and discovered the serious problems existing in the factory. For example, the factory leaders had subjectively regarded workers who generally did not speak much as middle-of-the-roaders based on one-sided reports, those who said one or two strange things as backward elements, and even those who expressed dissatisfaction or grumbled at administrative leaders and activists as suspicious elements. Although the workers had opinions on this, they dared not raise them. Based on the materials obtained, the CCP Guangzhou Municipal Committee has inspected the Party's leadership of the factory. The Guangdong Provincial People's Government's Industry Department has also transferred the factory director Liu Baochen, deputy director Du Lun, and supervisory committee member Ye Wobo from their positions. Now the factory is rectifying its ranks, concentrating all its efforts, letting go of mobilizing the masses, and vigorously launching the democratic reform movement.
    The lesson of the Guangdong Paper Mill shows that if the factory's Party organization or responsible Party cadres have insufficient understanding of democratic reform and relax their leadership over democratic reform, they will certainly not be able to earnestly implement the Party's policies and smoothly carry out the democratic reform movement. Every Communist Party member in industrial and mining enterprises must resolutely support and participate in the democratic reform movement.

### 广东造纸厂主要党员干部不负责任  民主改革工作进展极慢

    广东造纸厂主要党员干部不负责任
    民主改革工作进展极慢
    广州市广东造纸厂的民主改革工作，因副厂长、党的支部书记杜伦、监委叶卧波等重视不够，消极敷衍，没有好好发动群众，以致未能形成运动。
    广东造纸厂的几个主要负责人——杜伦、叶卧波与厂长刘宝琛等长期以来就闹不团结，遇事互相猜忌，互相推诿，他们各有程度不同的官僚主义。在民主改革工作开始以后，他们仍在一些旧问题上纠缠不清，因而思想、行动不统一，没有把民主改革作为压倒一切的中心任务，甚至对民主改革工作采取了消极观望的态度。五月底，杜伦虽曾向职工作过有关这一问题的报告，却没有订出具体计划，更没有深入地去发动群众。八月底，广东省人民政府工业厅副厅长黄锡川带领工作队到该厂协助进行民主改革工作，并根据中共广州市委会的指示，从头做起，重新了解情况。杜伦、叶卧波对此表示不满，认为这是完全否定了过去的工作成绩。于是，杜、叶等对民主改革工作的态度更加消极，以至抗拒。杜伦在开会时常迟到早退，很少发言。叶、杜二人都有“看你们（工作队）搞吧”的错误想法，并且常常讽刺工作队，说工作队“客观主义”，讥笑工作队“摸来摸去还不是我们那一套”。
    但是，工作队的同志仍然继续进行工作，并发现了该厂存在着的严重问题。如该厂领导人员曾主观地根据片面反映把一般不大说话的工人当作中间分子，说一两句怪话的当作落后分子，甚至把对行政领导同志、积极分子表示不满或发牢骚的一律认为是可疑分子。工人虽然对此有意见，但又不敢提出来。根据所得的材料，中共广州市委会对该厂党的领导已作了检查。广东省人民政府工业厅并将该厂厂长刘宝琛、副厂长杜伦、监委叶卧波调职。现该厂正整顿队伍，集中一切力量，放手发动群众，大力开展民主改革运动。
    广东造纸厂的教训说明：如果工厂的党的组织或负责的党员干部，对民主改革认识不足，放松对民主改革的领导，就一定不能认真地执行党的方针，顺利开展民主改革运动。在工矿企业中每一个共产党员必须坚决拥护并参加民主改革运动。
