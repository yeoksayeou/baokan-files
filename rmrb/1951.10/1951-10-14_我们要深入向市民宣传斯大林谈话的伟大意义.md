    We must deeply publicize the great significance of Stalin's talk to the citizens
    Editor:
    After the publication of Comrade Stalin's talk on the issue of atomic weapons, the students of Beijing Normal University unanimously expressed their support and spontaneously organized study sessions by class, dormitory, or reading group.
    During the study, the sophomores of the History Department suggested that, in order to further eliminate the remnants of pro-American sentiment among the citizens, we should deeply publicize this great gospel of peace to the citizens, so that they can further recognize the international situation and the strength of the peace camp. Students from other departments and grades also realized that they are members of the peace fighters, and that their work and study are closely related to the world peace cause. Therefore, they are determined to conscientiously revise the patriotic pact, implement the academic hour system, strengthen unity, study hard, and exercise, so as to become talented, virtuous, and physically strong people's teachers.

    我们要深入向市民宣传斯大林谈话的伟大意义编辑同志：
    斯大林同志关于原子武器问题的谈话发表以后，北京师范大学同学一致表示拥护，并且自动地按班级、寝室或读报小组进行了学习。
    在学习中，历史系二年级的同学提出，为了进一步肃清市民中的恐美思想的残余，要把这一伟大的和平福音，向市民们深入地宣传，使他们进一步认清国际形势与和平阵营力量的强大。其他各系级同学也认识到自己是和平战士的一员，自己的工作学习密切地关连着世界和平事业；因而决心认真地修订爱国公约，执行学时制，并加强团结，努力学习，锻炼身体，使自己成为才德兼备，体魄健壮的人民教师。
