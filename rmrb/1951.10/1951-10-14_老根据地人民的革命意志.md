    I am from Shazhouba, first district, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, which is where Chairman Mao once lived. My family background is that of a poor peasant. I am forty-three years old this year. I was sold as a child bride when I was young and was often beaten and mistreated. After the Red Army came to our village, I received revolutionary education and joined the Communist Youth League in 1930, working in the Dongfa Township Democratic Government. In 1935, when the Red Army went north to resist the Japanese, I was left behind to persist in local guerrilla warfare. Later, due to the harsh environment, I dispersed the female comrades in the guerrilla team to live with the people, helping them collect firewood for their livelihood. Later, the enemy captured me, demanding that I hand over the guerrilla team and weapons. At the time, I thought: "I would rather sacrifice myself than allow the revolution to suffer losses." The enemy hung me up and beat me three times, and imprisoned me for a month and a half, but I never yielded to the enemy.

    Not long after I came out of prison, I married Yang Ronggui. In 1945, the enemy forced Yang Ronggui to become the Ba長 [head of a Bao, a subdivision of the 保甲 system]. We took this opportunity to organize the peasants to resist conscription, grain levies, and taxes. At night, we would gather the poor peasants for meetings. When conscription officers came, the young people would go up into the mountains. When the enemy demanded grain and money, we would assign it to the wealthy households. That autumn, the reactionary government levied large amounts of grain and money, demanding two hundred and twenty shi [a unit of dry volume] of grain from our township. The masses could not afford it. I thought, when the Red Army went north, they left me here to persist in the work. No matter how cruel the Kuomintang is, the Red Army will definitely return, and I should persevere to the end. So, I encouraged Yang Ronggui to fight against the enemy and organized the masses to resist paying grain. Later, the Kuomintang sent three grain-collecting agents. They came in, beating and scolding, saying that we were resisting grain levies and violating "national law." I was furious. I grabbed a broom and started hitting them wildly, calling the villagers to help. The whole village came, and everyone tied the three bastards to a tree and beat them until they were half-dead. At that time, someone reminded us: "What do we do? If the reactionary government finds out, will the whole village survive?" After discussion, we decided to kill them outright and bury them far away to avoid future troubles. Later, a traitor from our village, Lai Ying, informed the reactionary government. Upon receiving this news, we quickly held an emergency meeting and decided to burn the corpses to destroy the evidence. At the time, everyone said: "A wise man doesn't fight when the odds are against him. Instead of waiting for them to come, let's leave first." So, the whole village went up into the mountains overnight. Before dawn, the reactionary government sent many soldiers to capture me, but they found no one, only capturing three old women and two girls. Unable to do anything, the enemy killed and ate all the chickens, ducks, and livestock in the village and burned my house to the ground. The enemy could not catch me, so they posted notices everywhere, offering eighty thousand Guan Jin [old currency] for my capture and sixty thousand Guan Jin for Yang Ronggui's capture. Because I hid myself well, the enemy still could not catch me. The reactionary government then threatened the peasants of the whole township to return by burning down all the houses in the township. However, because the two thousand-plus peasants were closely united and resolutely resisted, the reactionaries finally did not dare to do so. Two months later, the traitor Lai Ying informed again, and the reactionaries captured me. They used all kinds of torture on me: the first was to pour chili water down my throat; the second was to stick ten flower needles into my ten fingers, and two more needles into my breasts, which caused me to faint from the pain; the third was to use an awl to cut a groove in my arm, dip chicken feathers in kerosene, insert them into the flesh and set them on fire, the pain and stench caused me to faint again; the fourth was electrocution; the fifth was the "thunderbolt" torture. The enemy's torture did not make me yield in the slightest. I thought: "Our killing of the bloodsuckers is a just act. If I have to die, I will die alone, and I must not implicate everyone. Justice will surely prevail! The Red Army will return and avenge me!" Thinking of this, I became more determined and brave. The more cruel the enemy's torture, the less I feared. I said to the reactionary judge: "You gang of traitors, are you not Chinese? You collude secretly with the Japanese devils, openly kill countless revolutionary people, where is your conscience! Don't think I am a woman, I have noble national integrity, I have excellent qualities. You unreasonably want to kill Huang Xiuying, I tell you, more Huang Xiuyings are following behind! Kill if you want to kill!" I shed tears of indignation, and the people around me were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes. I began to feel comforted. I thought: My death is worthwhile, the broad masses sympathize with me. Finally, the judge sentenced me to death, but there was no basis at all. The people of Shazhouba were not convinced and appealed to the pseudo-Ganzhou Higher Court. I was imprisoned in Ruijin for five months and then transferred to the pseudo-Ganzhou Higher Court, where I was imprisoned for another three years, but they still could not get a confession from me. The enemy had no choice but to declare me innocent. The people of the whole township sold their pants and coats to raise some money to bail me out. When the masses saw me suffering, they were as if they had seen a loved one, and everyone cried together in a mixture of grief and joy. I said with emotion: "Don't cry, everyone, turn tears into strength! My being able to return today is the result of our victory in the struggle of not fearing sacrifice. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's words, we will definitely meet the Red Army! In the future, we should strengthen unity, consolidate the organization, and defend the democratic sacred land – Shazhouba!"

    Now the mainland of the whole country has been liberated. My suffering was not in vain, our great struggle has been victorious! I was a little mentally disturbed in the past because of the cruel persecution by the Chiang Kai-shek gang; but since liberation, hearing that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu have returned, I am extremely excited, and my illness has gradually improved. The glory of victory shines again on Shazhouba. Now, the house where Chairman Mao once lived has been renovated and is even more beautiful than before; the furniture that Chairman Mao used is arranged in the room as it was originally, for the people of the whole country to visit.

    老根据地人民的革命意志
    南方老根据地江西瑞金代表  黄秀英口述  王定国笔记
    我是毛主席曾经住过的地方——江西瑞金县一区沙洲坝人，成份是贫农，今年四十三岁。我从小就被卖给人家当童养媳，经常挨打受气。红军来到我们家乡以后，我受了革命教育，一九三○年参加了共产主义青年团，在东法乡民主政府工作。一九三五年红军北上抗日，我被留下来坚持地方游击战争。后因环境恶劣，我把游击队里的女同志分散安置在老百姓家里，帮助老百姓打柴过生活。后来敌人捉住我，要我交出游击队和枪枝。当时我想：“宁可自己牺牲，决不叫革命受损失”。敌人吊打了我三次，关了一个半月，我始终没有向敌人屈服。
    从狱里出来不久，我和杨荣桂结了婚。一九四五年，敌人逼迫杨荣桂当保长。我们就利用这个机会，组织农民抗丁、抗粮、抗税。到夜里就召集贫农开会。要丁的来了，青年人就上山去。敌人要粮要款，我们就派给富户出。当年秋天，反动政府大量派粮派款，在我乡派了二百二十石粮，群众拿不出来，我想，红军北上时，留下我在这里坚持工作，不管国民党多么凶残，红军一定要回来的，我应当坚持到底。于是我一面鼓励杨荣桂和敌人斗争，一面将群众组织起来抗粮不交。以后国民党派来了三个催粮人员，进门来又打又骂，说我们抗缴粮款，违犯“国法”。这时我恨极了，一面拿着扫把乱打一阵，一面呼唤村子里的人来帮打。全村群众都来了，大家把三个坏蛋捆在树上，一齐动手打，直打得半死不活。当时有人提醒说：“怎么办？叫反动政府知道了，我们全村还得活吗？”经过大家商讨，决定索性把他们打死，远远埋掉，免出后患。后来我村的叛徒赖英向反动政府告了密。我们得此消息，即赶快召开紧急会议，决定把坏蛋的尸体焚毁，灭迹。当时大家说：“好汉不吃眼前亏，不等他们来，我们先走。”于是全村群众连夜上了山。天还没亮，反动政府派了很多兵来捕捉我；但他们扑了个空，只搜去了三个老太太和两个女孩子。敌人没有办法，把全村的鸡鸭牲畜都给杀吃了，并把我家烧得片瓦不留。敌人抓不到我，便到处张贴布告，上写着捉到我赏给八十万关金，抓到杨荣桂赏给六十万关金。由于我藏的严密，敌人还是抓不到我。反动政府又拿烧掉全乡房子威胁全乡的农民回来，但是由于二千多农民紧密团结，坚决反抗，反动派终于未敢这样做。两个月后，又是叛徒赖英告了密，反动派把我捕去。他们对我用尽了一切毒刑：第一套是灌辣椒水；第二套是把十根花针扎在我的十指内，又用两个针扎到乳房里，把我痛晕过去；第三套是用锥子在我手膀上挑一道沟，把鸡毛蘸上洋油，插到肉里点火烧，我连痛带臭又昏倒了；第四套是过电；第五套是打地雷公。敌人的毒刑丝毫没有使我屈服。我想：“我们杀死吸血鬼是正义的行动。要死，我一个人死，决不能连累大家。正义一定会胜利的！红军回来必定会给我报仇！”想到这里，我就更坚决，更勇敢。敌人的毒刑越残酷，我越不怕。我对反动法官说：“你们这些狗党汉奸们，你们不是中国人？暗里和日本鬼子勾结，公开的杀害无数的革命人民，你们的良心何在！你不要看我是个女子，我有高贵的民族气节，我有优良的品质，你们无理的要害死我黄秀英，我告诉你们，更多的黄秀英跟在后面，要杀，你们杀吧！”我激愤地滴下了热泪，旁边的人感动得眼泪也夺目而出，我开始得到了安慰。我想：我死了是有价值的，广大群众是同情我的。最后法官判了我死刑，可是一点根据都没有。沙洲坝的人不服气，就上告到伪赣州高等法院。我在瑞金被关了五个月后，便被解到伪赣州高等法院，又被押了三年，还是没问出我的口供来。敌人无法，只好宣判我无罪。全乡群众卖裤子当袄凑了些钱，才把我保回来。群众看到我受苦受罪，如同见了亲人，大家悲喜交加，哭成一团。我感动地说：“大家不要哭，把眼泪变成力量吧！我今天能回来，是我们大家不怕牺牲斗争胜利的结果。我们要牢牢记住毛主席的话，我们一定能和红军见面的！今后我们更应加强团结，巩固组织，保卫民主圣地——沙洲坝！”
    现在全国大陆解放了。我的罪没有白受，我们的伟大斗争胜利了！我过去因为受到蒋匪帮的残酷迫害，神经有些失常；但是从解放以后，听到毛主席朱总司令都回来了，我兴奋极了，病也逐渐好了。胜利的光辉重新照耀在沙洲坝。现在，毛主席曾住过的房子又加以刷新，比过去更美丽；毛主席原来用的家具，又按原样摆设在房里，供全国人民观瞻了。
