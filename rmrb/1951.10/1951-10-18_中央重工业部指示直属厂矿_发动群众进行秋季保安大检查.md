The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Directs Directly Subordinate Factories and Mines to Mobilize the Masses for Autumn Security Inspection

The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has decided that all directly subordinate factories and mines will conduct an autumn security inspection from October to December this year to further improve the security work of factories and mines and prepare for the implementation of economic accounting. Since the emergency general inspection at the end of 1949, thanks to the efforts of all employees and the increased attention of leaders at all levels, safety work has shifted to prevention. Significant achievements have been made in ensuring the safety of employees and guaranteeing the completion of production tasks. During the flood season in 1950, 233 potentially serious accidents were avoided due to prior inspection and the implementation of necessary preventive measures. At the same time, widespread safety education was carried out, criticizing erroneous ideas such as "only valuing machines and not people," "working for money and ignoring safety," "fatalism," and "irresponsibility towards state property." The concept of safe production began to take root among factory and mine leaders and workers. Thirty units under the ministry, bureaus, and subordinate factories and mines have successively established safety organizations and formulated and implemented certain safety regulations and systems. As a result, personnel casualties and property losses in 1950 were significantly reduced compared to 1949. For example, one unit in North China had ten deaths and forty-seven serious injuries due to accidents during production in 1949, with property losses exceeding 300 million yuan. In 1950, there were no deaths, serious and minor injuries were reduced to thirty-six, and property losses decreased by 89.3% compared to 1949. However, there are still many problems in the safety work of factories and mines directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry. Some leading cadres still do not pay enough attention to the safety and health of workers and lack sufficient understanding of safe production. Some urgent problems that can be solved have not been solved in time. Leading cadres only focus on completing production tasks, are negligent in safety management, and lack adequate prevention, resulting in continuous accidents and a considerable number of casualties. After accidents occur, factories and mines often fail to seriously analyze the causes, investigate responsibilities, and impose strict penalties, instead shifting the blame onto the workers. Some units, fearing punishment or not receiving rewards, underreport accidents or even conceal them altogether. In addition, relevant safety and hygiene regulations and systems are not complete and systematic, and their implementation is not serious. According to extremely incomplete statistics, there were still as many as 1,298 accidents in factories and mines in 1950, resulting in 887 employee casualties (28 deaths) and property losses of more than 2.1 billion yuan. In the first half of this year, the number of casualties reached 1,244 (8 deaths), with the factories and mines under the Iron and Steel Bureau being the most serious, with a total of 923 casualties (6 deaths) in half a year.

Based on the above statistics and the current situation of production recovery and development, the safety and health issues of factories and mines urgently need to be resolved.

The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's instructions on the autumn security inspection specify in detail the key points, requirements, and organizational leadership of the inspection. The instructions emphasize that this inspection must adopt various methods to carry out publicity and education, strengthen ideological leadership, and make leading cadres and all employees realize the great political and economic significance of safety and health work. All workers and staff should be mobilized in various ways to conduct security inspections with a sense of ownership, and to solve the problems they can solve under leadership. Serious criticism and exposure must be carried out for the ideological problems existing in each unit.

During the inspection, it is also necessary to promptly correct the incorrect views of factory and mine leaders on the inspection and prevent possible deviations: for example, some people mistakenly believe that the inspection work is a task of the higher authorities, not an important work of the factory and mine itself, and they are being inspected, so they cannot actively carry out the inspection; some people oppose safety inspection and production, believing that arranging inspection work will disrupt the production plan and affect production, and do not understand that safety inspection is to further ensure that production can proceed smoothly; some people have concerns about mobilizing the masses to carry out inspections, and dare not expose the weaknesses of factory and mine security work, fearing that if the masses are mobilized, too many problems will be raised that cannot be solved for a while, or they are afraid of being punished; some people take a perfunctory attitude towards inspection, and think that "everything is fine after the rain" after the inspection is over, and are not good at transforming emergency work into regular work. If these erroneous ideas cannot be corrected in time, the security inspection will be difficult to truly play a role; at the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to preventing the phenomenon of being eager for quick success, demanding too much, and being divorced from reality.

The instructions point out that mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses is the key to doing a good job in the security inspection. Leading cadres at all levels must truly recognize that the security inspection is a mass movement, and they must broadly educate the masses through the forces of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League systems to establish a correct concept of safe production; adopt a method combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to thoroughly expose the problems that hinder the safety and health of employees and the machines and equipment, and mobilize all workers, staff, and technicians to closely integrate and conduct in-depth research, and personally solve the problems that can be solved. This is the key to doing a good job in the security inspection, and leaders at all levels must resolutely and thoroughly implement it.

### 中央重工业部指示直属厂矿  发动群众进行秋季保安大检查

    中央重工业部指示直属厂矿
    发动群众进行秋季保安大检查
    中央重工业部决定各直属厂矿自今年十月至十二月进行秋季保安大检查，以便进一步做好厂矿保安工作，为实行经济核算制作好准备。该部自一九四九年底紧急大检查后，由于全体职工的努力，由于各级领导开始重视，安全工作已转向以防范为主，在保障职工的安全与保证生产任务的完成方面已获得不少成绩。一九五○年的雨季防护工作中，由于事先检查并采取必要的防范措施，避免了可能发生的较严重的事故二百三十三件。同时普遍地进行了安全教育，批判了“只重视机器不重视人”“干活赚钱不管安全”和“听天由命”“对国家财产不负责”等错误认识。在厂矿领导干部和工人群众中，开始树立安全生产思想。部、局及所属厂矿已有三十个单位先后建立了安全机构，制定并实行了某些安全规程和制度。因之，一九五○年的人员伤亡及资财损失较一九四九年均有显著减少。如华北的一个单位，在一九四九年生产过程中因事故死亡者十人，重伤者四十七人，资财损失三亿余元；在一九五○年中则消灭了死亡，轻重伤减少为三十六人，资财损失较一九四九年降低百分之八十九点三。但是重工业部直属厂矿的安全工作中还存在着许多问题。若干领导干部对劳动者的安全与健康仍然重视不够，对安全生产仍然认识不足。有些急需解决并可能解决的问题未能及时解决。领导干部只顾完成生产任务，对安全管理麻痹大意，事先防范不周，以致事故仍不断发生，伤亡现象仍相当严重。事故发生后，各厂矿往往不能认真分析原因，追究责任，进行严格处理，而把责任推到工人身上。某些单位因为怕受处分，怕得不到奖励，发生事故后以大报小，或竟隐匿不报。另外有关安全卫生的规程制度尚不够完整、系统，并且未能认真贯彻。据极不完整统计，一九五○年各厂矿发生事故仍达一二九八次之多，计伤亡职工八八七人（死亡二八人），资财损失计二一亿余元。今年上半年伤亡人数即达一二四四人（死亡八人），其中以钢铁局所属厂矿最为严重，半年中共伤亡九二三人（死亡六人）。
    根据上述统计及当前生产的恢复和发展情况来看，厂矿安全卫生问题急待解决。
    重工业部关于秋季保安大检查的指示中，详尽地规定了检查的重点、要求及组织领导问题。指示中并着重指出，此次检查必须采取各种方式，进行宣传教育，加强思想领导，使领导干部及全体职工认识到安全卫生工作在政治上经济上的重大意义。应该利用各种方法动员全体工人、职员以主人翁的态度，进行保安大检查，有领导地解决自己所能动手解决的问题。对于各单位存在的思想问题，必须进行严肃的批判和揭露。
    在检查中，还须及时纠正厂矿领导干部对检查的不正确看法，及时防止可能发生的偏向：比如有些人误认为检查工作是上级的任务，而不是厂矿自身的重要工作，自己是被检查者，因而不能主动进行检查；有的人把保安检查和生产对立起来，认为布置检查工作就会打乱生产计划影响生产，不了解保安检查就是为了进一步保障生产能顺利进行；有的人对发动群众进行检查有顾虑，不敢揭露厂矿保安工作的弱点，唯恐发动了群众，提出过多问题一时解决不了，或者怕受处分；有些人对检查抱应付态度，检查一完即认为“雨过天晴”，“万事大吉”，不善于将突击工作转为经常工作，这些错误思想如果不能及时纠正，保安检查就很难真正发生作用；同时还须注意防止急于求成，要求过高，脱离实际的现象。
    指示指出发动群众，依靠群众是做好保安大检查的关键。各级领导干部必须切实认识保安大检查是群众性的运动，必须通过党、行政、工会、青年团各系统力量，广泛教育群众，树立安全生产的正确观念；采取自上而下与自下而上相结合的方法，彻底揭发有碍职工安全健康与机器设备上所存在的问题，发动全体工人职员与技术人员密切结合深入研究，亲自动手解决可能解决的问题。这是做好保安大检查的关键，各级领导必须坚决彻底执行。
