Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: Today, the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcasted a radio address by Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, to Japanese workers regarding the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident." The broadcast stated that the broad masses of Chinese working people feel extreme anger towards the unreasonable verdict in the "Matsukawa Incident." Now, as the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" is being held, the broad masses of Chinese people are closely watching and concerned about the progress of the second trial and are prepared to fully support the struggle of the innocent victims of the "Matsukawa Incident."

The broadcast pointed out that the "Matsukawa Incident" is precisely one of the frantic means of persecution employed by the Japanese Yoshida government against the Japanese working class and the Japanese Communist Party. This action by the Yoshida government was carried out under the direction of its American masters. The purpose of U.S. imperialism is to enslave the Japanese people and turn Japan into a U.S. colony and a tool for the U.S. to launch wars of aggression.

After exposing the separate peace treaty with Japan as a war treaty, the broadcast said: The recent rapid upsurge of the Japanese people's movement against the separate treaty is the best proof that the Japanese people are determined to oppose American enslavement. The Chinese people are concerned about this struggle of the Japanese people. The broadcast emphasized that the Chinese people firmly believe that no matter what despicable conspiracies U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionary rulers use, they cannot suppress the just struggle of the Japanese people, and conspiracies like the "Matsukawa Incident" will ultimately go bankrupt. The Japanese people will surely win the final victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism. In this struggle, the Japanese people will receive the full support of all the Chinese people and all the people of Asia.

Wu Yuzhang's Telegram to Suzuki Shin and Others
Xinhua News Agency: Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union, sent a telegram to Japanese patriotic workers Suzuki Shin and others, supporting their just struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and also sent telegrams to Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida and Suzuki Teijiro, Chief Judge of the Sendai High Court, protesting their persecution of Japanese patriotic workers. The three telegrams are as follows:

(1) Telegram to Suzuki Shin and Others:
To Suzuki Shin and the twenty patriotic worker brothers, c/o the Unified Committee of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union:

On behalf of 1.3 million educators in China, I extend my highest respect and cordial greetings to your indomitable spirit of upholding the just struggle!

I have lodged a strong protest to Prime Minister Yoshida and Judge Suzuki, demanding that they immediately release you. We, all the educational workers in China, will do our utmost to support your glorious and persistent struggle.

With brotherly greetings!

Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union
October 19, 1951

(2) Telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida:
To Mr. Yoshida, Prime Minister of the Japanese Government:

The "Matsukawa Incident" is a shameful conspiracy, instigated by you under the prompting of U.S. imperialism, to frame patriotic Japanese workers.

Having learned that this case will be held for a second trial in Sendai, I, on behalf of 1.3 million educators in China, demand that you immediately order the Sendai High Court to release those innocent patriotic people who have been arrested, otherwise your government will be responsible for all the consequences.

Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union
October 19, 1951

(3) Telegram to Suzuki Teijiro, Chief Judge of the Sendai High Court:
To Mr. Suzuki Teijiro, Chief Judge of the Sendai High Court, and Judges Sasaki and Takahashi:

Having learned that the "Matsukawa Incident" case, fabricated by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, will be held for a second trial in your court on October 23rd, I, on behalf of 1.3 million educators in China, demand that you declare the twenty patriotic people, including Suzuki Shin, innocent and release them. This is the common demand of all patriotic Japanese people and world peace-loving and democratic people.

If you disregard the wishes of the people and deliberately frame good people, it will cause great disasters for Japan. We, the Chinese educational workers, will definitely fight to the end to support and support their just struggle to defend their right to survival.

Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union

A Letter from the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth to Japanese Youth
Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth sent a letter to Japanese youth on the 26th, supporting their struggle against the separate peace treaty with Japan and against the persecution of innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The full text of the letter is as follows:

To the Japanese Youth Patriotic Front, Dear Japanese Youth Friends:

As you are fiercely launching a heroic struggle against the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan and striving for national independence, we would like to express the fraternal concern and heartfelt respect of all Chinese youth to you.

We deeply understand that due to the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Japanese fascist financial groups and warlords, for the past six years, Japan is facing an unprecedented national crisis and a sharp deterioration of the people's economic life. Japanese youth today are in a dire situation. We also know that your struggle to liberate yourselves from disaster is growing and developing. From the booklet "Japanese Youth's Struggle for Peace and Against Militarization," distributed by the Japanese Youth Patriotic Front at the Berlin Festival, we saw how Japanese youth are bravely carrying out the struggle to defend peace, strive for independence, and oppose re-militarization and colonization together with the Japanese people in various work posts and in various ways.

The Japanese reactionaries fabricated the so-called "Matsukawa Incident" and persecuted twenty outstanding sons and daughters of the Japanese people. This brutal verdict reflects the fear of the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries towards the power of the Japanese people. We have seen the letters from the defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident," such as Comrade Saito Chi, to the Chinese people and the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union. We have also received a letter from Honda Kazuo, the younger brother of another defendant, Honda Noboru. They vowed "to persevere in defending the truth for peace and independence, and to bravely advance for victory." The high patriotism, heroism, and firm will to defend peace in Asia and the world of the Japanese people and youth have inspired us. As the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" is held, we Chinese youth will use our struggle to support your struggle. We must expose the truth of this incident to the world and let peace-loving and democratic people all over the world condemn this reactionary measure. We firmly believe that with the support of the world's peace and democratic forces, you will definitely crush the enemy's conspiracy!

In order to attempt to occupy Japan for a long time, enslave the Japanese people, and make Japan a military base for aggression against Asia, U.S. imperialism illegally signed a unilateral peace treaty with Japan at the San Francisco Conference. This act of U.S. imperialism, which is hostile to the people of Asia and the world, has aroused the firm opposition of all the Chinese people and youth. All parts of the country have held condemnation meetings, parades, demonstrations, and mass rallies, and have responded to the further aggression of U.S. imperialism against Asia by continuing to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. At the same time, we also know from the newspapers that a strong mass movement against the illegal treaty has also been aroused throughout Japan. This shows that the youth of China and Japan have united and are advancing hand in hand in the common struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of peace in Asia and the world!

As you said in your letter: "Our struggle and your struggle are connected!" We express our infinite indignation at the U.S. imperialists' wanton persecution of the Japanese people and youth brothers. In order to defend peace in Asia and the world, we must join hands and fight our common enemy. On the Korean battlefield, the American aggressors have been severely hit by the combined forces of the Chinese and Korean peoples. We firmly believe that the unity and persistent struggle of the Japanese people and youth will surely win the final victory and make Japan an independent, democratic, and free country.

The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth
October 26th

    我国人民团体向日本人民坚决表示
    声援“松川事件”无辜被告的斗争
    反对奴役日本人民的美制单独和约李颉伯对日本工人的广播词
    【新华社二十八日讯】今日中央人民广播电台播发中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯为日本“松川事件”第二审对日本工人广播词。广播说：中国广大劳动人民对“松川事件”无理的判决感到极端的愤怒。现在，在“松川事件”举行第二审的时候，中国广大人民正在密切注视和关怀着第二审进行的情况，并准备以全力支援“松川事件”无辜被难者们的斗争。
    广播指出：“松川事件”正是日本吉田政府对日本工人阶级和日本共产党所施的疯狂的迫害手段之一。吉田政府的这一行动是在它的美国主人的指使之下进行的。美帝国主义的目的，就是要奴役日本人民，要把日本变作美国的殖民地和美国发动侵略战争的工具。
    广播在揭露单独对日和约是战争条约之后说：最近日本人民反对单独和约运动的迅速高涨，即是日本人民决心反对美国奴役的最好证明。中国人民正在关切地注视着日本人民的这一斗争。广播强调说：中国人民深信，美帝国主义及日本反动统治者不管用什么卑鄙的阴谋手段，都是压服不了日本人民的正义斗争的，“松川事件”之类的阴谋终归是要破产的。日本人民必能在反对美帝国主义的斗争中获得最后的胜利。日本人民在这一斗争中，将获得全中国人民和全亚洲人民充分的支持。吴玉章给铃木信等的电报
    【新华社讯】中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章致电日本爱国工人铃木信等，支援他们对美日反动派的正义斗争，并电日本首相吉田和日本仙台高等裁判所审判长铃木祯次郎抗议他们对日本爱国工人的迫害。三个电文如下：
    （一）致铃木信等电：日本国铁工会统一委员会转铃木信等二十位爱国工人弟兄们：
    我谨代表中国一百三十万教育工作者，对于你们这种不屈不挠坚持着正义斗争的精神，表示崇高的敬意与亲切的慰问！
    我已向吉田首相与铃木审判长提出严重抗议，要求他们立即释放你们。你们这种光荣的坚持斗争，我们中国全体教育工作者将尽最大的力量来支援你们。
    致兄弟般的敬礼！
    中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章
    一九五一年十月十九日
    （二）致日本首相吉田电日本政府首相吉田先生：
    “松川事件”，是你在美帝国主义的嗾使下有计划地制造的、陷害爱国日本工人的可耻阴谋。
    兹闻这一案件又将在仙台举行第二次审判，我特代表中国一百三十万教育工作者，要求你立即命令仙台高等裁判所释放那些无辜被捕的爱国志士，否则一切后果均由贵政府负责。
    中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章
    一九五一年十月十九日
    （三）致日本仙台高等裁判所审判长
    铃木祯次郎电日本仙台高等裁判所审判长铃木祯次郎先生、裁判官佐佐木、高桥先生：
    顷闻由美日反动派所制造的“松川事件”案件，又将于十月二十三日在贵所进行第二次审判。我代表中国一百三十万教育工作者要求你们对于铃木信等二十位爱国志士宣判无罪释放，这是全体爱国的日本人民与世界和平民主人民的共同要求。
    如果你们不顾人民的愿望，蓄意诬陷善良，必将为日本造成莫大的灾害。我们中国教育工作者一定为支持和声援他们这个保卫自己生存权利的正义斗争而坚决奋斗到底。
    中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章
    一九五一年十月十九日我民主青联给日本青年的信
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华全国民主青年联合会总会二十六日致函日本青年，支援他们反对单独对日和约、反对迫害“松川事件”无辜被告的斗争。该函全文如下：日本青年祖国阵线转亲爱的日本青年朋友们：
    当你们正在炽烈地展开反对美国单独对日和约，争取祖国独立的英勇斗争时，我们谨以此信表示全中国青年对你们兄弟般的关怀和衷心的敬意。
    我们深切地了解，由于美帝国主义及其走狗日本法西斯财阀与军阀六年来的反动统治，已使日本面临着空前的民族危机与人民经济生活的剧烈恶化，日本青年今天正处在水深火热的灾难中。我们也知道你们为了把自己从灾难中解放出来而进行的斗争，正在日益成长与发展中。我们从日本青年祖国阵线在柏林联欢节散发的以“日本青年争取和平、反对军国主义化的斗争”为题的小册子中，看到日本青年怎样英勇地在各种工作岗位上以各种不同方式与日本人民一起进行保卫和平、争取独立、反对重新军国主义化与殖民地化的斗争。
    日本反动派制造所谓“松川事件”，迫害了二十个日本人民的优秀子弟。这一残暴的判决正反映了美帝国主义和日本反动派对日本人民力量的恐惧心理。我们曾看到“松川事件”的被告斋藤千等同志们给中国人民和中国铁路工会全国委员会的来信，我们亦曾接到另一被告本田升同志的弟弟本田和男的来信，他们誓言“要为和平独立而坚持保卫真理，要为胜利而勇敢前进”。日本人民与青年的这种高度爱国主义的英雄气概和保卫亚洲与世界和平的坚定意志，鼓舞了我们，在对“松川事件”的被告举行第二审之际，我们中国青年要用自己的斗争来支援你们的斗争，我们一定要把这个事件的真相向全世界揭露，让全世界爱好和平民主的人士来斥责这一反动措置。我们深信在全世界和平民主力量的支持下，你们一定能粉碎敌人的阴谋！
    美帝国主义为了企图长期占领日本，奴役日本人民，并使日本成为侵略亚洲的军事基地，在旧金山会议上非法地签订了片面对日和约。美帝国主义这种与亚洲及世界人民为敌的行为，已经引起了全中国人民与青年的坚决反对，全国各地都举行了控诉会、游行示威、群众大会，并以继续加强抗美援朝运动来回答美帝国主义对亚洲的进一步侵略。同时我们从报纸上也知道在日本全国也已引起了反对非法和约的强大的群众运动。这说明了中日两国青年已经在反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫亚洲与世界和平的共同斗争中团结一致，携手并进！
    正如你们来信中所说：“我们的斗争，你们的斗争，是相通的！”对于美帝国主义恣意地迫害日本人民及青年兄弟们的行为，我们表示无限的愤慨，为了保卫亚洲及世界和平，我们必须携起手来，和我们的共同敌人作斗争。在朝鲜战场上美国侵略者已遭到中朝两国人民联合力量的痛击。我们深信，日本人民与青年的团结力量与坚持不懈的斗争，必将获得最后的胜利，使日本成为一个独立、民主、自由的国家。
