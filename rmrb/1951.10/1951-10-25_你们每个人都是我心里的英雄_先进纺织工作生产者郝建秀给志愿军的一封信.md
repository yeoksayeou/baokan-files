You are all heroes in my heart
—A letter from advanced textile worker Hao Jianxiu to the Volunteer Army

Dear Volunteer Army comrades:

I am happy when I think of you. I am even happier and jump for joy on the anniversary of your departure to fight abroad.

You are fighting in very difficult conditions in Korea. We have never forgotten the hardship you endured eating fried flour with snow in the winter; nor have we forgotten your contributions to repelling the American devils. I enjoy hearing stories about you the most, and reading the "Korean Dispatches" in the newspaper. I am happy from the bottom of my heart whenever I hear news of your victories. I often think: you are truly remarkable people! It is you who are protecting our motherland and allowing everyone to live a good life.

In the year since you went abroad, our motherland has undergone great changes! I am a female worker at Qingdao No. 6 State-Owned Cotton Mill in Qingdao. Take our factory as an example: the Labor Insurance Regulations have been implemented, the feudal overseers have been abolished, and a spare-time sanatorium and a nursery have been built. The Qingdao Federation of Trade Unions is also building a large club; and the Qingdao Municipal People's Government is building workers' dormitories... Without Chairman Mao's leadership and without you, how could we have all these things? Everyone in the motherland is thinking about you and talking about you. In the factory, whether it's listening to reports, watching plays, singing, or listening to the radio, everyone's emotions immediately become fervent as soon as you are mentioned. When families gather on the heated brick bed, they also talk about you. One day, my little brother, carrying a stick, sang "Valiantly and spiritedly, crossing the Yalu River..." I asked him, "What are you doing?" He said proudly, "I am a volunteer soldier!" Dear Volunteer Army comrades, even little brothers admire you so much. You think of the people of the motherland, and the people of the motherland think of you day and night.

When we encounter difficulties in our work, we encourage each other: "Learn from our Volunteer Army!" We treat the "factory as a battlefield" and the "spindle as a gun." In our spinning workshop, we proposed that "reducing bad yarn is like drawing the tendons of American imperialism." In our patriotic pact, we wrote "Resist America, Aid Korea, increase production patriotically, and donate airplanes and cannons." In production, everyone is extremely enthusiastic. My awareness has improved, I have used my brain, and I have come up with a way to reduce the amount of leather roller waste. I didn't think it was anything special, but the leaders sent people to summarize the experience and held a spinning meeting in Qingdao to promote it nationwide. The leaders calculated that if this experience were promoted nationwide and everyone reduced leather roller waste, the wealth added to the country in one year could buy eighty fighter jets.

This year, for National Day, the leaders asked me to come to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, which made me so happy that I couldn't sleep that night. I always wanted to see Chairman Mao and the Volunteer Army, and this time I saw them all. On the evening of September 30th, I met Chairman Mao, and I was so happy that I was grinning from ear to ear. I didn't even hear the people next to me talking to me. This is the most glorious thing in my life. Later, at a symposium, Tian Guiying told me, "Look! The heroes of the Volunteer Army: Guo Zhongtian! Zhou Wenjiang!" I walked over and shook hands with Guo Zhongtian and Zhou Wenjiang. I can't even describe how happy I was in my heart at that moment. I said, "I am truly honored to see you." They said, "You are so young, and you have created this working method, creating wealth for the country. You are a good young person of the Chairman Mao era." I thought to myself: Can this little thing compare to what you have done? If you hadn't protected the motherland, could I have come up with this working method? Isn't this your achievement? At the time, I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to find them later, so I quickly took out my notebook and asked them to sign it. This notebook is so precious because it has the names of Guo Zhongtian and Zhou Wenjiang. Dear Volunteer Army comrades, seeing Guo Zhongtian and Zhou Wenjiang is like seeing all of you. Each of you is the same, and you are all heroes in my heart.

I participated in the National Day celebration and saw the greatness of our motherland. Look! Our mighty troops, one team after another, one row after another, air force, army, navy, paratroopers, militia... The weapons are simply too numerous to count, tanks, artillery, rocket launchers, some of which I had never even seen before. Suddenly, planes came, faster than the speed of sound, jet planes! With such a strong army and so many new weapons, we are sure to defeat American imperialism.

There were so many people in the parade. When I saw Chairman Mao and the Volunteer Army watching the ceremony, I shouted and screamed. I jumped and shouted along with everyone, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Volunteer Army!"

Finally, I want to tell you some good news. In the past, my leather roller waste rate was 0.25%, but now 56 workers in our No. 6 Factory's spinning workshop have surpassed me. Li Xiufen created a new national record of 0.102%. This is a great happy event.

I am currently in Beijing and have been invited to attend the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a non-voting delegate. I assure you: when I return to the factory, I will humbly learn from my comrades, avoid complacency and arrogance, improve my working method, enrich my working method, and create more wealth for the motherland to purchase airplanes and cannons. The entire Chinese people support you, with the front and rear united as one. We will increase production and donate more; heroic Volunteer Army comrades, you will kill more enemies. Aren't you killing an average of 5,600 every day now? I think you will kill even more in the future, win more victories, and defeat American imperialism soon!

Extending to you my highest respects,

Hao Jianxiu

    你们每个人都是我心里的英雄
    ——先进纺织工作生产者郝建秀给志愿军的一封信亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    想起你们来，我就高兴，逢到了你们出国作战一周年的日子，我更高兴的直跳。
    你们在朝鲜作战是很困难的。我们从没有忘记你们在冬天就着雪吃炒面的艰苦；更没有忘记你们打退美国鬼子的功劳。我最乐意听别人讲你们的故事，看报上的“朝鲜通讯”。一听到你们胜利的消息，从心眼里高兴。我常想：你们真是了不起的人呀！是你们保卫了咱们祖国，叫大家过着美好的生活。
    你们出国一年来，咱们的祖国变化可大啦！我是青岛市国营青岛第六棉纺厂的一个女工，单拿咱们工厂来说吧：实行了劳动保险条例，取消了封建把头，还建立了业余休养所，盖了托儿所；青岛市总工会还在盖大俱乐部；青岛市人民政府又在盖工人宿舍……没有毛主席的领导，没有你们，那能有这些呢？祖国的每一个人在想着你们，念叨着你们。在工厂里，无论听报告啦，演话剧啦，唱歌啦，听广播啦，只要一提到你们，大家的情绪马上会热烈起来。一家人围在炕上啦起呱来，也说到你们。有一天我小弟弟扛着一根棍子，唱着“雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江……”的歌，我问他：“你这是干什么？”他很神气地说：“我是志愿军！”亲爱的志愿军同志们，小弟弟们都是这样的爱慕你们啊，你们想着祖国人民，祖国人民也日夜想着你们。
    在工作遇到困难的时候，大家互相鼓励：“学学咱们志愿军！”我们把“工厂当战场”，把“一枚锭子当一杆枪”，我们细纱间提出了“减少坏纱就是抽美帝国主义的筋”。爱国公约上，我们写上了“抗美援朝，爱国增产捐献飞机大炮”。在生产上，大伙那股热火劲大极啦。我的觉悟提高了，开动了脑筋，想出了办法，少出了皮辊花。我自己觉着没有什么，可是上级派人来总结经验，还在青岛开了细纱会议，向全国推广呢。上级计算了一下，若是在全国推广这个经验，都少出了皮辊花，一年给国家增加的财富，可以买八十架战斗机。
    今年国庆节，上级叫我到北京来参加国庆节典礼，把我高兴的当晚就没睡着觉。平常总想看看毛主席，看看志愿军，这回可全看着了。九月三十日晚上，我见到了毛主席，高兴的我直裂着嘴笑，旁人和我说话，我也没听见。这是我一辈子顶光荣的事。后来，在一个座谈会上，田桂英告诉我：“看！志愿军的英雄：郭忠田！周文江！”我走上去拉着郭忠田、周文江的手，心里那阵子高兴就不用说了。我说：“看到你们，我真光荣。”他们说：“你这么年轻，创造了这套工作法，为国家创造了财富，是毛主席时代的好青年。”我心里想：这点东西能和你们比吗？没有你们保卫了祖国，还能有我这套工作法？这还不是你们的功劳。当时，我怕呆会找不着他们了，赶紧拿出小本来，请他俩签名。这个小本可宝贵啦，因为有郭忠田、周文江的名字。亲爱的志愿军同志们，见到了郭忠田、周文江，就见到了你们，你们每个人都是一样，都是我心里的英雄。
    我参加了国庆节典礼，看到了咱们祖国的伟大。看吧！咱们雄壮的队伍，一队队，一排排，空军，陆军，海军，降落伞部队，民兵……。武器简直数不完有多少种，坦克呀，大炮呀，火箭炮呀，有些看都没看到过。忽然，飞机来了，比声音还快，是喷气式飞机呀！我们有这样强大的军队，有这样多的新武器，打败美帝国主义，是一定的。
    游行的队伍那么多，看见了毛主席，看见了观礼的志愿军，喊呀，叫呀，我跟着大伙跳呀，喊呀，喊“毛主席万岁”！喊“志愿军万岁”！
    末了，我还要告诉你们一桩好消息，过去，我的皮辊花率是百分之○·二五，现在咱们六厂细纱车间有五十六个工友已经超过了我，李秀芬创造了百分之○·一○二的全国新纪录。这是一件大喜事。
    我现在在北京被邀列席参加中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会。我向你们保证：我回到厂里，一定虚心地跟着同志们学习，不自满、不骄傲，提高我的工作法，充实我的工作法，为祖国创造更多的财富，购买飞机大炮。全中国人民支援你们，前线后方拧成一条心。我们多增加生产，多捐献；英雄的志愿军同志们，你们多杀敌人。现在不是每天平均杀他五千六百多个吗？我想你们将来会杀的更多，打更多的胜仗，早日打垮美帝国主义！
    向你们致崇高敬礼
                            郝建秀
