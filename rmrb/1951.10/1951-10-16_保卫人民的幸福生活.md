    Defend the People's Happy Life
    Cui Jingwu, People's Liberation Army National Day Observance Delegate, Combat Hero
    I am the Deputy Company Commander of the Second Company, Third Battalion, 804th Regiment. I have long looked forward to seeing our great leader Chairman Mao. It is a great honor to be able to participate in the National Day ceremony in the people's capital, Beijing, and to see our Chairman Mao!
    I am from Chifeng, Rehe. From the age of four, I worked as a laborer for the landlord. Because of the endless beatings and suffering, I fled to another village. My father was tortured to death by the Japanese devils, and my mother didn't even have a coffin when she died. Before she died, she cried and said to me, "Child, you must avenge your father!"
    In 1947, Chifeng was liberated. I heard that the Eighth Route Army was the people's army, so I joined the army. In December of that year, I gloriously joined the Party! From the Northeast to the South of the Yangtze River, I have received ten major merits and four minor merits.
    In May 1948, during the battle of Longhua in Rehe, Comrade Dong Cunrui, a martyr of our brother unit, sacrificed himself in Longhua. I was the squad leader of the Sixth Squad at the time. The enemy in Longhua was very stubborn, and the fortifications were very good. There were pillboxes all around, surrounded by several layers of caltrops, barbed wire, and inner and outer trenches. The enemy said, "Iron Longhua! The Liberation Army can't break in!" But we broke in! Our squad of fifteen or sixteen people had only five dilapidated guns. The other comrades only carried grenades. We used inferior weapons to eliminate the enemy with superior equipment.
    At that time, the task of our First Company was to attack the enemy's No. 8 pillbox. There were two small pillboxes on the left and right of the pillbox, with an open space of forty or fifty meters. The enemy's firepower densely blocked all three sides, and shells kept falling on our positions. Several blasting attempts resulted in casualties to several comrades, and the mission was not completed. So Company Commander Wang Zhenhai gave the task to me. I thought: Communists have no insurmountable difficulties. I braved the crossfire and rushed up. Just as I advanced not far from the pillbox, an enemy shell hit the explosive pack and knocked me down. After a while, the sound of the artillery woke me up again. I felt my body and found that I was not injured, only my hair and eyebrows were scorched. I pulled out two more grenades and rushed up. The enemy's machine gun swept at me fiercely. I silenced it with one grenade. Under the cover of fire, I quickly rushed to the side of the pillbox and occupied a small pillbox with a volley of grenades. At this time, the company commander brought the troops up, and I continued to attack the large pillbox. I threw two blasting bottles into the enemy's large pillbox, and most of the enemies were killed inside. The No. 8 pillbox was taken down. I followed the instructor and five or six comrades into the city of Longhua. I captured twelve enemies alone and seized a heavy machine gun and eight rifles. In this battle, I made two major contributions and received a hero's medal.
    After the battle of Longhua, we participated in the Jinxi Campaign and fought all the way to Guannei. I continuously made several major contributions and won several hero medals.
    In this way, under the cultivation of the Party and the leadership, I, an ordinary person, improved my understanding and became a combat hero.
    No matter how difficult the battle was, I always hoped day and night to see the development and strength of the new China. My wish has finally come true. I have seen the great achievements of the new China in the past two years! Now everyone is living a good life. Take my family as an example. Before I joined the revolution, I didn't have a single tile on the roof or a single piece of land. Now my family has thirty mu of land. In the future, everyone will have a better life. But U.S. imperialism does not want us to have a good life. It is invading Korea, invading our country, and destroying world peace. We know how we came out of hardship, we know how the new China grew, and we have the strength to defend our motherland and defend world peace.

    保卫人民的幸福生活
    人民解放军国庆节观礼代表战斗英雄  崔景武
    我是八○四部队三一支队二连的副连长。早就盼望见见咱们伟大的领袖毛主席，这次能够到人民的首都北京参加国庆典礼，能够看到咱们的毛主席，真是十分光荣！
    我是热河赤峰人，从四岁起就给地主扛活。由于挨不尽的打受不尽的气，我逃到了外乡。我的父亲是给日本鬼子拷打死的，母亲死的时候连个棺材都没有，临死时还哭着对我说：“孩子，你要给父亲报仇啊！”
    一九四七年，赤峰解放了，我听说八路军是人民的军队，就参加了军队。这一年十二月，我光荣地入了党！从东北到江南，我立过十个大功四个小功。
    一九四八年五月，打热河隆化，兄弟部队的董存瑞烈士就是在隆化牺牲的。我当时是六班长。隆化敌人是很顽强的，工事也很好，四面都是子母碉堡，围绕碉堡有几道鹿砦、铁丝网和内外壕，敌人说：“铁的隆化！解放军打不进去！”但是我们打进去了！我们班十五、六个人，只有五支破烂枪，其他的同志只背了手榴弹，我们就用劣等武器消灭了有优良装备的敌人。
    那时，我们第一连的任务是攻击敌人第八号碉堡，碉堡左右有两个小碉堡，有四、五十米的开阔地，敌人火力三面密集封锁，炮弹不住落在我们的阵地上。几次爆破，伤亡了好几个同志，也没有完成任务，于是连长王振海把任务交给了我。我想：共产党员没有克服不了的困难。便冒着交叉火力，冲上去。刚前进到碉堡不远的地方，敌人一炮正打中了炸药包，把我轰倒了，一会儿炮声又把我震醒了。我摸了摸身上没有受伤，只是把头发眉毛烧焦了，便又抽出两个手榴弹冲上去。敌人的机枪向我猛扫，我一个手榴弹就把它打哑了，在火力掩护下，我很快就冲到碉堡边，一顿手榴弹占领了一个小碉堡。这时，连长带部队上来了，我又接着向大碉堡进攻，两个爆破瓶，都投到敌人大碉堡里去，大部分敌人都炸死在里面。第八号碉堡拿下来了，我随着指导员和五、六个同志冲进隆化城里，我一个人又俘掳了十二名敌人，缴获了重机枪一挺，步枪八枝。在这次战斗中，我立了两大功，得到一个英雄奖章。
    在打了隆化以后，我们又参加了锦西战役，一直打到关内。我连续立了几个大功，荣获了几个英雄奖章。
    我就这样在党和上级的培养下，由一个普通的人，提高了认识，变成了战斗英雄。
    我无论在怎样艰苦的战斗里，日夜都想望能够看到新中国的发展和强大。我的愿望终于实现了，我看到了两年来新中国伟大的成就！现在每一个人都在过着好日子。就拿我家来说，我参加革命前房瓦没有一片，地没有一垧，现在我家里也有了三十亩地了。将来每个人都有更好的日子过了。但是美帝国主义却不要我们过好日子，正在侵略朝鲜，侵略我国，破坏世界和平，我们知道我们是怎样从艰苦里走过来的，我们知道新中国是怎样生长的，我们有力量保卫祖国，保卫世界和平。
