    Ehrenburg's Speech
    We have a proverb in our Soviet Eastern Republics: "A bad friend is like a shadow, only with you when the sun is shining." But the friendship between our two peoples has withstood the test of many years: we are together when the sun is shining, we are together when dark clouds fill the sky, in adversity, in victory we are together.
    The friendship between our two peoples has changed the course of history: this is the friendship of two powerful countries. Almost one-third of all mankind lives on our lands, and this is a guarantee of peace. These two giants are inviolable; the hands of those who covet the property of others, no matter how long they are, are too short to do such a thing.
    Our friendship does not threaten anyone. It only threatens war. This is the friendship of two peace-loving nations whose desire is to build cities, cultivate land, and raise children. That is why all peace defenders—in India and in France, in Britain and in Italy—welcome our friendship.
    Before I left for China, I went to a village one hundred kilometers from Moscow. The collective farmers surrounded me and repeatedly said: "Please tell the Chinese that we love them!" I find it difficult to convey the words of love through translation. However, I know that the feelings of the Soviet people will certainly be conveyed to your hearts. Yesterday I happened to go to a small city—Changping. An ancient, tall city wall separates it from the outside world. However, I saw countless portraits of Stalin and Mao Zedong there. The citizens surrounded me, and it turned out that they were all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. When I return to Moscow, I will certainly tell our people how they welcomed me and how much they love the Soviet people.
    Long live the friendship of the two great nations!
    Long live peace!

    爱伦堡讲话
    我们苏联的东方共和国有一句谚语：“不好的朋友像影子，只有天空出太阳的时候，他才同你在一起。”可是，我们两国人民之间的友谊却经得起许多年考验：天空出太阳的时候，我们同在一起，黑云密布天空的时候，我们同在一起，在患难中，在胜利中我们都在一起。
    我们两国人民的友谊改变了历史的行程：这是两个强大国家的友谊。全人类几乎有三分之一的人都生活在我们的土地上，这就是和平的保证。这两位巨人是不可触犯的；看到别人的财产就垂涎三尺的人们的手，不管它有多么长，要干这种勾当还是短的。
    我们的友谊是不威胁任何人的。它所威胁的只是战争。这是两个爱好和平的民族的友谊，他们的愿望是建设城市、耕耘土地和让孩子们长大起来。这就是为什么一切和平保卫者——在印度和在法国，在英国和在意大利，都欢迎我们的友谊的缘故。
    在我动身来中国以前，我曾经到过一个距离莫斯科一百公里的乡村。集体农场的农民们围住我，反复地说：“请告诉中国人说，我们热爱他们呢！”我很难通过翻译把爱的词句传达出来。但是，我知道，苏联人民的情感是一定能够转到你们的心里的。昨天我偶然到了一个小城市——昌平。一座古老的高大的城墙使它和外面隔开了。但是，我在那儿却看到了数不清的斯大林和毛泽东的画像。市民把我围起来，原来他们都是中苏友好协会的会员。我到莫斯科一定把他们怎样欢迎我和怎样热爱苏联人民的事实讲给我国人民听。
    两大民族的友谊万岁！
    和平万岁！
   （按尚有雅科夫列夫、郭忠田、胡楠卿、卢清华、刘德珍、钱正英等讲话全文于明日发表。）
