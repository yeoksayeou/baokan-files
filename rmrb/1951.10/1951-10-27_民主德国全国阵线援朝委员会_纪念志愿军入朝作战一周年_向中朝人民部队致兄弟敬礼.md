The National Front of Democratic Germany Aid Korea Committee issued a statement on the 25th, commemorating the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going to Korea to fight, extending fighting, brotherly greetings to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean fighters striving for liberation. The statement said: The German people are watching the self-sacrificing struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers with sincere admiration.
