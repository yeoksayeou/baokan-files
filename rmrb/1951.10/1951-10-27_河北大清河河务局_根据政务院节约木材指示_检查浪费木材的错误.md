    Hebei Daqing River Conservancy Bureau
    Inspects Errors in Wasting Timber Based on State Council Directive on Saving Timber
    Editor Comrade:
    After studying the "State Council Directive on Saving Timber" published in the People's Daily on August 17th, we conducted a preliminary inspection of our department's use and storage of timber, and found that there were indeed many instances of waste. For example, during this year's Daqing River spring repairs, we planned to drive a wooden pile every meter on the bottom trough of the newly built Fang Fenghongkou fixed project, totaling more than 600 piles. However, after driving more than 400 piles, the plan was changed to drive one every 5 decimeters. Later, we felt that the piles were too small and needed to add more than 30 large piles. This rendered a portion of the originally driven small piles useless, thus wasting not only timber but also manpower. When we purchased wooden piles in Lixian County, we also felled trees that could not be used for river work, felling a total of 198 trees, but only 129 were usable. We have 39 locations for storing timber in Xincheng, Gaoyang, Boye, and Lixian counties, of which only six are well preserved. The timber stored in the remaining 33 locations has rotted considerably due to rain and sun exposure. The four counties store a total of 2,560 wooden piles, of which 359 have rotted. There are many other similar instances of wasting timber. The reasons for the waste are that some cadres do not recognize or value the importance and scarcity of timber in our country's construction, and have the mindset of "rather have it than not" and "rather have more than less" when designing projects; they only seek quantity when purchasing timber, regardless of quality; and they do not use old materials when using materials, believing that storing them is convenient. Therefore, the following should be noted in the future: First, we must conscientiously study the directive on saving timber and strengthen education on cherishing national property, so that every cadre's understanding is raised a step. Second, when designing projects, we must be conscientious and precise in designing the specifications and quality of the timber required. Third, when purchasing timber, we should purchase according to the required specifications and quality. Fourth, when using timber, we should strictly adhere to the principle of making the most of the material, not using long materials for short purposes or large materials for small purposes; and we should give priority to using old materials. Fifth, we should clean up the existing timber, properly store what can be used for river work for future use, and properly dispose of what cannot be used.

### 河北大清河河务局  根据政务院节约木材指示  检查浪费木材的错误

    河北大清河河务局
    根据政务院节约木材指示
    检查浪费木材的错误编辑同志：
    我们学习了人民日报八月十七日刊登的“政务院关于节约木材的指示”后，即对本部门使用和保管木材方面作了初步检查，发现确有不少浪费现象存在。如今年大清河春修时，我们计划在新盖房分洪口固定工程的底槽上每隔一公尺打木桩一根，共要打六百余根；但当打桩四百余根后，计划就改变了，要每隔五公寸打一根。后来我们又觉得桩太小，要再加三十余根大桩。这样使原来打的一部分小木桩就失去了作用，因此不仅浪费了木料，也浪费了人力。我们在蠡县采办木桩时，把不能用于河工的树也伐了，共伐倒了一九八棵，能用的却只有一二九棵。我们在新城、高阳、博野、蠡县四县存放木材的地点有三十九处，其中只有六处保存较好，其余三十三处存放的木材均因雨淋日晒，腐朽不少。四县共计存放木桩二、五六○根，腐朽的即达三五九根。像这样浪费木材的现象还很多。造成浪费的原因，是有的干部没有认识或不重视木材在我国建设上的重要和缺乏的状况，在设计工程时，存在“宁有勿无”“宁多勿少”的想法；购买木料时只求数量，不顾质量；用料时不用旧料，认为存着方便。因此今后应该注意的是：一、要认真学习节约木材的指示，并加强爱护国家资财的教育，使每个干部的认识都提高一步。二、设计工程时，对需用木材的规格、质量，要认真负责，精确设计。三、购买木料时应根据需用规格质量采办。四、使用木料时应严格掌握材尽其用的原则，不使长材短用、大材小用；并且应该尽先利用旧料。五、对现存木料进行清理，能用于河工的妥善保管待用，不能用的即作妥善处理。
