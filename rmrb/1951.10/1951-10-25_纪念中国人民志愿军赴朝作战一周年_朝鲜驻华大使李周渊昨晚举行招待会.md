Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: Korean Ambassador to China, Li Zhouyuan, held a reception on the evening of the 24th to commemorate the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

Invited to the reception were: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; Peng Zhen, Vice-Chairman; Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department; representatives of the Army, Air Force, and Navy of the People's Liberation Army; Du Ping and other representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army attending the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as representatives of combat heroes, wounded soldiers, and families of the Volunteer Army, and people from all walks of life, including Ye Jizhuang, Teng Daiyuan, Zhu Xuefan, Li Dequan, Peng Zemin, and Zhang Hanfu, totaling over one hundred people.

Also invited were Czechoslovak Ambassador Weiskopf, Romanian Ambassador Rudenko, Mongolian Ambassador Jalkasekhan, Bulgarian Ambassador Petkov, Polish Chargé d'affaires Daoding, Vietnamese Delegation Chargé d'affaires Zhou Liang, Soviet Embassy Counselor Fedlin, German Democratic Republic Diplomatic Mission Counselor Grutner, Hungarian Embassy Counselor Fekete, and others.

Ambassador Li Zhouyuan first expressed his heartfelt gratitude and respect on behalf of the Korean people to the Chinese people and all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. Ambassador Li said: The great Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting alongside the Korean People's Army, has improved the war situation over the past year and dealt a heavy blow to the enemy. The great internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has not only inspired the people of Asia but also inspired the confidence in victory of peace-loving people all over the world. Ambassador Li concluded by saying: The era of imperialism dominating the world is over. The war of the Korean and Chinese people is just. Victory will surely belong to the Korean and Chinese people.

Chairman Guo Moruo then delivered a speech, saying: The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people is a common victory for all the people of Asia and a common victory for all peace-loving people in the world. All the people of Asia and the world are rejoicing and encouraged by our common great victory. All the people of Asia and the world have increased their confidence in winning the struggle for peace and against U.S. aggression.

Guo Moruo pointed out: U.S. imperialism has not learned the lesson it deserves from its failures. Although it has been forced to accept the Kaesong armistice talks, it is still waging a hopeless war of aggression, it is still occupying our Taiwan, and it is colluding with the remnants of Japanese fascists to prepare to expand its aggression in Asia. Therefore, the people of China and Korea must unite more closely and deal heavier blows to the enemy. We, the Chinese people, are determined to strengthen our movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in order to support the Chinese and Korean people's armies and strive for a victorious end to the Korean War.

The foreign envoys and chargés d'affaires present successively delivered congratulatory speeches. They unanimously expressed warm congratulations on the glorious victory won by the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in fighting to defend peace.

The reception proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. After the reception, the Cui Chengyi Dance Research Class performed song and dance programs, and a film was shown.

    纪念中国人民志愿军赴朝作战一周年
    朝鲜驻华大使李周渊昨晚举行招待会
    【新华社二十四日讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使李周渊为纪念中国人民志愿军赴朝作战一周年，在二十四日晚举行招待会。
    应邀到会的有：中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若、副主席彭真、秘书长刘宁一，中国人民革命军事委员会代总参谋长聂荣臻、总政治部副主任萧华，人民解放军陆、空、海军代表，中国人民志愿军参加中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议代表杜平等和志愿军战斗英雄、伤病员代表、志愿军家属代表，以及各界人士叶季壮、滕代远、朱学范、李德全、彭泽民、章汉夫等共一百余人。
    应邀到会的还有捷克斯洛伐克大使魏斯柯普夫、罗马尼亚大使鲁登科、蒙古大使贾尔卡赛汗、保加利亚大使彼得科夫、波兰大使馆代办道定、越南代表团代办周亮、苏联大使馆参赞费德林、德意志民主共和国外交使团参赞葛鲁特纳、匈牙利大使馆参赞费凯尔特等。
    李周渊大使首先代表朝鲜人民向中国人民和志愿军的全体指挥员战斗员致衷心的感谢和敬意。李大使说：伟大的中国人民志愿军赴朝和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，一年来已使战局好转并给了敌人以沉重的打击。中国人民志愿军伟大的国际主义精神不但鼓舞了亚洲人民，而且也鼓舞了全世界爱好和平人民的胜利信心。李大使最后说：帝国主义称霸世界的时代已经过去了，朝中人民的战争是正义的。胜利一定是属于朝中人民的。
    郭沫若主席接着致辞，他说：中朝两国人民的伟大胜利是全亚洲人民共同的胜利，是全世界爱好和平人民的共同胜利。全亚洲人民和全世界人民都为我们共同的伟大胜利而欢欣鼓舞。全亚洲全世界人民都在争取和平、反对美国侵略的斗争中增加了必胜的信心。
    郭沫若指出：美帝国主义并没有在失败中得到应有的教训。它虽然被迫接受了开城的停战谈判，但它依然在进行毫无希望的侵略战争，它依然占领着我们的台湾，并且与日本法西斯残余势力勾结起来，准备扩大亚洲的侵略。因此，我们中朝两国人民必须更加紧密地团结起来，给敌人更沉重的打击。我们中国人民决心要加强我们的抗美援朝运动来支援中朝人民军队，来争取朝鲜战争的胜利结束。
    到会的各国使节以及大使馆代办相继致祝辞。他们对于为保卫和平而战的英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军获得的光辉胜利，一致表示热烈的祝贺。
