    We Miao people have suffered oppression and exploitation for thousands of years. Especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to the Kuomintang's reactionary policy of eliminating ethnic minorities, our ethnic group was on the verge of extinction. With the victory of the Chinese revolution, that dangerous and terrible fate has passed. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have been liberated. Now we are throwing ourselves into the warm embrace of the motherland with unparalleled enthusiasm and beginning to create our own better lives. We Miao people are determined to follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to the ideal society. However, American imperialism is doing everything possible to undermine the great liberation cause of our various ethnic groups, hate our motherland, openly arm and occupy our territory of Taiwan, and burn the flames of aggressive war to our doorstep – Korea, and repeatedly violate our territorial waters and airspace. This barbaric behavior of the United States has aroused great hatred among the people of the whole country and our Miao people. Like our brotherly ethnic groups, we must resolutely fight to defend our motherland and world peace.

    American imperialism is not only an enemy of the Chinese people, but also an enemy of the people of the world. Since the end of World War II, it has consistently and actively prepared to launch new wars of aggression, and has recently become particularly frantic. Just at this time, Marshal Stalin, the leader of the people of the world, delivered a speech on atomic weapons on the 6th of this month. This speech has inspired the confidence of the people of the world in the struggle to defend peace, and also inspires our Miao people to further participate in the struggle to defend peace. In the past, our Miao people have done a lot of work in the struggle to defend peace. We, regardless of men and women, actively participated in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. For example, in the third district of Sanjiang County, Guangxi, the task of handing over public grain was overfulfilled by more than 700,000 catties last year. Pingmao Township in that district delivered all 260,000 catties of public grain to the warehouse within five days. In the donation movement, there were also many moving examples, such as Wang Fuzhi and his wife conducting a donation competition. In addition, our outstanding young men and women enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army, the Volunteer Army, and the local armed forces to defend the motherland with practical actions. For example, Comrade Liu Xingwen from Nayong County, Guizhou Province, is a young man of only nineteen years old. On the Korean front, he and another volunteer soldier repelled eleven charges by American soldiers, killing and wounding more than one hundred enemies, and gloriously won the honorary title of combat hero of the Volunteer Army. These are all concrete manifestations of the Miao people defending the motherland and world peace with practical actions.

    However, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' long-term distortion of propaganda, coupled with the rumors spread by bandits and secret agents, it is undeniable that some Miao people still have varying degrees of fear or concern about atomic bombs. Now, Comrade Stalin's speech has made us fully understand this issue and strengthened our confidence in the struggle. We must vigorously develop production and strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea on the existing basis. We will never allow American imperialists to undermine our fruits of victory. Stalin's speech is a guarantee of victory and good news for world peace. It enhances the strength of defending world peace. This is one aspect. On the other hand, Stalin's speech is undoubtedly a serious blow to the imperialists; because the atomic bomb is the last "trump card" of the United States, and they superstitiously believe that this "trump card" can bring them world hegemony. However, this arrogant conspiracy of imperialism was completely shattered by Stalin's speech.

    As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has atomic weapons in order to be fully prepared to deal with aggressors. This is a further action by the Soviet people to defend peace. The great significance and role of this action have educated peace-loving people and also educated us Miao people that we must use strength and practical actions to defend peace. We Miao people are willing to work with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to intensify the struggle and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the front lines of the war against U.S. aggression, in order to completely defeat the American aggressors, defend the cause of peace to the end, and respond to Stalin's great call.

    斯大林谈话鼓舞了苗族保卫和平的信心
    参加国庆观礼苗族代表  杨文贵
    我们苗族几千年来受尽了压迫与剥削，尤其在国民党反动统治的时代，由于国民党采取消灭少数民族的反动政策，我们民族的危机几乎到了亡族灭种的地步。随着中国革命的胜利，我们那种危险可怕的厄运已经过去了。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，我们翻了身，现在我们正以无比的热情投入祖国温暖的怀抱，开始创造自己美好的生活；我们苗族人民决心要跟着共产党和毛主席走到理想的社会去。但美国帝国主义却千方百计地破坏我们各族人民伟大的翻身事业，仇视我们的祖国，公开地武装侵占我国领土台湾，将侵略战争的火焰燃烧到我国的大门——朝鲜，并多次地侵犯我国的领海领空。美国的这种横蛮的行为，激起了全国人民和我们苗族人民极大的仇恨，我们和各兄弟民族一样，要为保卫祖国和世界和平而坚决地斗争。
    美国帝国主义不但与中国人民为敌，它还与世界人民为敌；在第二次世界大战结束以来，它就一贯地积极准备发动新的侵略战争，最近进行得特别疯狂。正当这个时候，世界人民领袖斯大林大元帅于本月六日发表了关于原子武器的谈话。这个谈话鼓舞了世界人民保卫和平斗争的信心，也鼓舞着我们苗族人民更进一步参加保卫和平斗争的决心。过去我们苗族人民在保卫和平斗争中，曾经作了许多工作，我们不分男女都积极地参加了抗美援朝运动。如广西三江县第三区，去年超额七十多万斤完成了缴纳公粮任务，该区的平卯乡在五天内将二十六万斤公粮全部入仓。在捐献运动中，也有许多动人的事例，如王福志夫妻俩进行了捐献竞赛。此外我们的优秀青年儿女，都踊跃地参加人民解放军、志愿军和地方武装，以实际行动保卫祖国。如贵州纳雍县的刘兴文同志，是只有十九岁的青年，在朝鲜前线，他和另一个志愿军战士两人打退了美国兽兵的十一次冲锋，杀伤了一百多个敌人，光荣地获得了志愿军战斗英雄的光荣称号。这些都是苗族人民以实际行动保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的具体表现。
    但是，由于国民党反动派过去长期地作了歪曲的宣传，加上土匪特务的造谣，有些苗族人民中不可否认地还有着各种不同程度的对原子弹的害怕心理或顾虑。现在，斯大林同志的谈话使我们完全认清了这个问题，并坚定了我们斗争的信心。我们要在原有的基础上，大力发展生产，加强抗美援朝工作。我们的胜利果实绝不容许美国帝国主义者来破坏；斯大林的谈话就是胜利的保障，是世界和平的福音，它增强了保卫世界和平的力量。这是一方面。另一方面，斯大林的谈话无疑地是对帝国主义者的一个严重打击；因为原子弹是美国最后的“王牌”，他们迷信着这张“王牌”可以给他们带来世界的霸权。然而，帝国主义的这个狂妄的阴谋，被斯大林的谈话彻底粉碎了。
    大家知道，苏联备有原子武器，是为了要有充分的准备以对付侵略者。这是苏联人民保卫和平的进一步的行动。这个行动的伟大意义和作用，教育了爱好和平的人民，也教育了我们苗族人民必须以实力和实际行动来保卫和平，我们苗族人民愿意与全国人民一起，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，加紧斗争，支援抗美战争前线的中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军，以彻底击溃美国侵略者，将和平事业保卫到底，来响应斯大林的伟大号召。
