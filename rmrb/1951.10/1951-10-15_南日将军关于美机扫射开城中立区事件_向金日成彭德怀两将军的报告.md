Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 14th: The report made by General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation, to Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai regarding the incident of United Nations Command military aircraft strafing the Kaesong Neutral Zone on October 12.

On October 12, at around 17:35, three United Nations Command military aircraft illegally intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone and strafed with machine guns the Wanshou Mountain area, approximately five kilometers northwest of Kaesong within the neutral zone, as well as the Kaesong-Panmunjom highway less than one kilometer from Panmunjom. Near Panmunjom, United Nations Command military aircraft killed a twelve-year-old boy, Jiang Yongdun. A bullet entered from his left rib and exited from his right rib. His two-year-old younger brother, Jiang Yongzhi, who was in his arms at the time, was also wounded in the left wrist by the bullet.

(A) Report on the joint on-site investigation conducted by our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, Colonel Chai Chengwen, and Colonel Li Pingyi, together with the other side's investigating officers, Colonel Darrow and Lieutenant Colonel Edwards, from 21:05 to 22:20 on October 12:

(1) At 19:00 on October 12, our liaison officer began to notify the other side via radio telephone, requesting a joint investigation. At 19:35, the other side called to inform us that they would depart from Munsan at 19:45 to come to Panmunjom. Our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, Colonel Chai Chengwen, and Colonel Li Pingyi, along with staff and journalists, waited at Panmunjom for more than 30 minutes. At 21:05, the other side's investigating officers, Colonel Darrow, Lieutenant Colonel Edwards, and staff, a total of 14 people, arrived at Panmunjom. Our liaison officers informed the other side of the two locations where United Nations Command military aircraft had strafed, and both sides immediately began an investigation at a location near Panmunjom.

(2) At the impact point near Panmunjom, both sides' investigating officers first examined the bullet marks and bullet heads. At that time, 32 impact points had already been discovered on the highway and beside the highway, and multiple bullet heads were dug out from the bullet marks. The other side also had to admit that the shooting direction indicated by all the bullet marks was from northwest to southeast, and claimed that the machine gun bullets were armor-piercing bullets. With our consent, the other side's investigating officers took one bullet head. Both sides then examined the dead body and the wounded child, and questioned the dead child's parents and two older brothers about the aircraft strafing. The dead child's second elder brother, Jiang Yongyun, 15 years old, was fishing by the stream beside the highway at the time. The dead child was holding his younger brother and watching. When the aircraft approached, Jiang Yongyun ran to hide under the bridge by the stream. The dead child was hit by a bullet and rolled from the highway to the stream. The two-year-old younger brother in his arms was also hit by a bullet, wounded, and crying loudly by the stream. The dead child's family pointed out that the jet aircraft that intruded into the neutral zone and killed Jiang Yongdun flew from the northwest to the southeast in two groups, two in front and one behind. The aircraft had downward-protruding parts on both wings. Wu Taixia, a military policeman patrolling on the highway at the time, pointed out that the aircraft that carried out the strafing was clearly an American jet aircraft. When both sides' investigating officers were leaving the scene, the dead child's father, the 60-year-old Jiang Daxing, overcome with grief and indignation, grabbed the other side's translator and said, "Your aircraft killed my son! You killed someone and just leave like that?"

(3) After both sides' investigating officers questioned witnesses, the other side's Colonel Darrow claimed that the investigation that day was a preliminary investigation and requested to come again at 9:00 the next morning for further investigation. Our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, pointed out that although all the human and material evidence had fully proved the other side's responsibility, we did not object to the other side's request to continue the joint investigation at 9:00 the next morning. Colonel Zhang Chunshan stated that, on the order of the Chief Representative, he was lodging a serious protest with the other side and reserving the right to make all demands.

(B) Report on the joint on-site investigation conducted by our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, Colonel Chai Chengwen, and Colonel Li Pingyi, together with the other side's investigating officers, Colonel Darrow and Lieutenant Colonel Edwards, from 9:00 to 12:55 on October 13:

(1) At 9:00 on October 13, both sides' investigating officers met at Panmunjom. Upon inquiry by our liaison officer, the other side admitted that the machine gun bullet heads examined on the highway near Panmunjom on the evening of the 12th were from half-inch caliber bullets. Both sides first went to the location near Panmunjom to continue the investigation. At this time, 14 more machine gun bullet marks had been discovered in the vicinity. A total of 46 impact points were found. Both sides' investigating officers personally dug out bullet heads from the bullet marks. The other side had to admit once again that the direction indicated by all the bullet marks was from northwest to southeast. Both sides also questioned the dead child's second elder brother and the old farmer, Park Jung-yang, who lived near the scene of the incident. Both of them pointed out that the aircraft that carried out the strafing were jet aircraft with straight, extended wings and downward-protruding objects on both wings. Our liaison officer pointed out that the caliber and nature of the bullet heads, as well as the aircraft form described by the eyewitnesses, fully proved that the aircraft that carried out the strafing were American jet aircraft. The other side could not deny it, but still refused to immediately acknowledge their inescapable responsibility, only claiming that they would report the investigation results to their superiors. During the on-site investigation, the dead child's father kept closely following the investigating officers, refusing to leave, fearing that the other side would easily slip away again, grabbing the other side's personnel and demanding that they immediately return his child's life. Only after repeated persuasion from our side did he leave.

(2) Both sides' investigating officers then went to Wanshou Mountain to investigate. At that time, I had already discovered more than 140 impact points on the hilltop. All the bullet marks indicated that the strafing came from a direction south-southwest. The bullet heads were still half-inch caliber, armor-piercing bullets. After the on-site investigation, the other side also admitted that there was sufficient material evidence. Both sides also questioned Wang Laoshun, a woman, and Wang Chengchao, a teenager, at the foot of the mountain. Both of them stated that there were three aircraft that carried out the strafing, two in front and one behind, all of them jet aircraft. Wang Laoshun also pointed out that the aircraft had protruding objects on both wings. The other side admitted that there was sufficient evidence to report to their superiors.

(3) After the on-site investigations at both locations, our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, pointed out that all the human and material evidence in the investigation had completely determined the other side's responsibility, and on the order of the Chief Representative, lodged a serious protest with the other side again, reserving the right to make all demands, and requested the other side to handle this serious incident quickly and responsibly. Colonel Zhang Chunshan notified the other side that the liaison officer meeting originally scheduled for that day to discuss the resumption of the two sides' delegation meetings would be postponed until the next day (October 14) so that both sides could report the investigation results of this incident to their superiors and handle this incident quickly and responsibly, so that this incident would not become an obstacle to the progress of the liaison officer meeting.

    南日将军关于美机扫射开城中立区事件
    向金日成彭德怀两将军的报告
    【新华社开城十四日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军关于十月十二日联合国军军用飞机扫射开城中立区事件向金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员所作的报告。
    十月十二日十七时三十五分左右联合国军军用飞机三架先后非法侵入开城中立区以机枪扫射中立区内开城西北约五公里处万寿山地方以及开城板门店公路上距离板门店不足一公里的地方。联合国军军用飞机在板门店附近杀害了十二岁的小孩姜永敦，枪弹自左肋射进，从右肋射出，当时抱在他怀中的两岁幼弟姜永植左腕也受弹伤。
    （甲）十月十二日二十一时零五分至二十二时二十分我方联络官张春山上校、柴成文上校、李平一上校偕同对方调查人员戴罗上校、爱德华中校共同进行实地调查的报告：
    （一）十月十二日十九时我方联络官以无线电话开始通知对方要求共同进行调查，十九时三十五分对方来电话通知将在十九时四十五分从汶山出发来板门店。我方联络官张春山上校、柴成文上校、李平一上校偕同工作人员与新闻记者在板门店等候三十余分钟。二十一时零五分，对方调查人员戴罗上校、爱德华中校及工作人员等共十四人到达板门店。我方联络官告知对方联合国军军用飞机扫射的两处地点后，双方遂即在板门店附近一处开始进行调查。
    （二）双方调查人员在板门店附近着弹处，首先检查弹痕与弹头。当时已在公路上及公路旁边发现着弹点三十二处并在弹痕中挖出弹头多枚。对方也不得不承认所有弹痕所表现的射击方向均属自西北向东南，并宣称机枪枪弹是穿甲弹。经我方同意后，对方调查人员取去弹头一枚。双方继即检查死者尸首与受伤的幼童，并向死者的父母和两个哥哥询问当时飞机扫射的情况。死者的二哥姜永运，十五岁，当时在公路旁的小溪边捉鱼，死者抱着小弟在旁边观看。飞机逼近时，姜永运跑到溪边桥下躲藏，死者中弹从公路旁滚到溪旁，手中抱着的两岁的幼弟也中弹受伤滚到溪旁大哭。死者的家属指出：当时侵入中立区并杀害了姜永敦的喷气式飞机，分两批从西北方向飞向东南，两架在前，一架在后，飞机的两翼上，都有向下突出部分。当时在公路上巡逻的军事警察吴泰夏指出：施行扫射的飞机显然是美国的喷气式飞机。当双方调查人员走离现场时，死者的父亲六十岁的老翁姜大兴，激于悲愤，抓住了对方的译员说：“你们的飞机打死了我的儿子，你们打死了人难道就这么走了。”
    （三）双方调查人员询问人证以后，对方戴罗上校声称：当日的调查是初步的调查，要求次日上午九时再来调查。我方联络官张春山上校指出：虽然所有的人证和物证都已经充分地证明了对方的责任，但是并不反对对方次日上午九时继续进行共同调查的要求。张春山上校声明：奉首席代表之命，向对方口头提出严重的抗议，并保留提出一切要求的权利。
    （乙）十月十三日九时至十二时五十五分，我方联络官张春山上校、柴成文上校、李平一上校，偕同对方调查人员戴罗上校、爱德华中校，共同进行实地调查的报告：
    （一）十月十三日九时双方调查人员在板门店会晤。经我方联络官的询问，对方承认十二日晚在板门店附近公路上所检查的机枪弹头属于半英寸口径的枪弹。双方首先到板门店附近处继续进行调查。此时在该处附近又已发现机枪弹痕十四处。共发现着弹点四十六处。双方调查人员并在弹痕中亲自掘出弹头。对方也不得不再度承认所有弹痕所显示的方向，都是自西北向东南。双方又向死者的二哥和出事地点附近的老农夫朴正阳询问。两人都指出施行扫射的飞机是喷气式飞机，双翼成直线张开，两翼上并有向下的突出物。我方联络官指出：弹头的口径和性质，以及目击飞机的人证所说明的飞机形式，都充分地证明了施行扫射的飞机是美国的喷气式飞机。对方也无从抵赖，但仍不肯立即承认对方所无可逃避的责任，仅称将以调查结果报告上级。在实地调查时，死者的父亲紧跟着调查人员不肯走开，深恐对方又轻易地溜走，抓住对方人员要求对方立即还他孩子的命来。经我方一再劝解后方始离去。
    （二）双方调查人员继赴万寿山调查。当时我已在山头上发现着弹点一百四十余处。所有的弹痕均表现扫射系来自西南偏南的方向，弹头仍是半英寸口径的穿甲弹。对方在实地调查后也承认已有充分的物证。双方又在山脚下询问妇女王老顺和少年王成朝。两人都说明施行扫射的飞机三架，两架在前，一架在后，都是喷气式飞机。王老顺并指出飞机的两翼上有突出物。对方承认已有充分的证据报告上级。
    （三）双方在两处实地调查以后，我方联络官张春山上校指出调查中一切人证和物证都已经完全确定了对方的责任，并奉首席代表之命再度向对方口头提出严重抗议，保留提出一切要求的权利，并要求对方对此次严重的事件作迅速负责的处理。张春山上校通知对方将原定在当日举行的讨论双方代表团复会事宜的联络官会议，延期至次日（十月十四日）举行，以便双方将此次事件的调查结果向上级报告，并对此次事件作迅速负责的处理，使此次事件不致成为联络官会议进行的障碍。
