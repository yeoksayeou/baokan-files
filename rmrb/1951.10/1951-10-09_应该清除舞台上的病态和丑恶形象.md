    The Sickly and Ugly Images on Stage Should Be Cleared Away

    To the Editor:
    I completely agree with the opinions raised by Comrade Ma Shaobo in his article "Clearing Away the Sickly and Ugly Images on the Opera Stage" published on page three of the People's Daily on September 27th.

    Although I am not an opera worker, I am very concerned about opera reform. I believe that the development and reform of opera today is far behind the needs of the situation. In some of the operas currently performed, some parts seriously hurt national self-esteem. Take the opera situation in Nangong County, Hebei Province, for example: the women who appear on the stage are often weak and sickly, and are by no means images of working women. Especially the protagonist of Pingju "Ma the Widow Opens a Shop," Ma the Widow, with her despicable, lewd, and obscene image, really makes people want to vomit for three days. I believe that clearing away the sickly and ugly images on the opera stage is a serious task for opera workers today. I suggest that opera workers pay attention to the opinions raised by Comrade Ma Shaobo in this article, study them carefully, and implement them in their work.

    应该清除舞台上的病态和丑恶形象编辑同志：
    我完全同意马少波同志在九月二十七日人民日报第三版所载“清除戏曲舞台上的病态和丑恶形象”一文中提出的意见。
    我虽然不是戏曲工作者，但我很关心戏曲改革工作。我认为今天戏曲的发展和改革，远远赶不上形势的需要。在现在所演出的戏曲中，有些部分严重地伤害了民族自尊心。以河北南宫县的戏曲情况来说吧：在舞台上出现的女性常是病弱的，决不是劳动妇女的形象。尤其像评剧“马寡妇开店”的主角马寡妇，那种卑鄙下贱、淫荡猥亵的形象，真叫人作三日呕。我认为清除戏曲舞台上的病态和丑恶的形象，是今天戏曲工作者的严重任务。我建议戏曲工作者重视马少波同志在这一篇文章中提出的意见，认真加以研究，并贯彻到工作中去。
