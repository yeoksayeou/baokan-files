    Firmly Defending the 313 Heights of Shetou Mountain
    People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Yu Pan Gong
    On May 27th of this year, at dawn, my platoon received an order from the company headquarters: We were to reach the 313 Heights of Shetou Mountain, a crucial point on the Jinlian Highway north of Huachuan City, before dawn, to undertake a blocking mission. All the comrades in the platoon felt that this was the opportunity to strive for merit and become a meritorious platoon, and were determined to overcome any difficulties and complete the task.
    Upon reaching the mountain, I quickly surveyed the terrain, deployed defensive firepower, and mobilized everyone to dig fortifications.
    At dawn on the 28th, the American devils began to bombard our position. Three enemy tanks drove to the foot of the mountain and bombarded our position with cannons and machine guns. Before the smoke from the shelling on our position had cleared, the American devils rushed towards our platoon like herding sheep. I told everyone: "Keep calm! Wait until the American devils get close, then open fire together and let the devils taste our power!" All the comrades in the platoon whispered in response: "Platoon leader, don't worry! We'll make sure the American devils come but can't go back!" At this time, the American devils had climbed to within about thirty meters of our fortifications. I shouted: "Fire!" Then grenades, machine guns, and carbines roared furiously all at once. Under such dense fire, the American devils fell in front of our position. The enemies behind had no time to return fire and scrambled and crawled down the mountain to escape.
    That night, I discussed it with the second squad leader and decided to send out three combat teams to raid the enemy; we attacked three times overnight, killing and wounding many enemies.
    The next morning, as soon as it was light, the American devils launched a fierce attack on our platoon with a battalion of troops, supported by five tanks and five airplanes. Enemy planes dropped gasoline barrels and incendiary bombs, and our position was ablaze everywhere. In the raging fire, we repelled a total of nine enemy attacks, one after another. We heroically defended the top of the mountain.
    By noon, the soldiers were short of dry rations, and ammunition was also running low. I immediately called on everyone to conserve ammunition, making sure that every bullet took an enemy life. Comrade Yao Xueming, the cook, created a method of throwing grenades to kill more enemies: first pull the pin, and only throw it after seeing yellow smoke and hearing a crackling sound, so that more enemies can be killed. That's how we attacked the enemy. We held on until dusk, having fought for thirty-two hours, killing more than 150 enemies in total, while we only paid a slight price.
    At this time, my platoon's position was surrounded by the enemy on all sides, and we only had five grenades and forty bullets left. At this time, I decided to fight a way out and break through. With the fire support of the assault team, we broke through a gap and safely broke out of the enemy encirclement. After three days of marching, we returned to the company. At the commendation meeting, we were approved by our superiors as a first-class meritorious platoon; I was a first-class meritorious individual. (Attached picture)

    坚守蛇头山三一三高地
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  于泮功
    今年五月二十七日拂晓，我排接到连部的命令：要我们在拂晓前到达华川城北、金连公路要口的蛇头山三一三高地，担任阻击战的任务。全排的同志都认为这是争取立功、争取功臣排的时机到了，不怕任何艰难困苦，一定要完成任务。
    到了山上，我很快观察了地形，布置了防卫火力，并动员大家挖工事。
    二十八日拂晓，美国鬼子开始向我们的阵地炮击。敌人的三辆坦克开到山下，以炮和机枪向我们阵地一齐猛轰，我们阵地上的炮烟未熄，美国鬼子便像赶羊似的向我们一排冲来。我告诉大家：“沉着气！等美国鬼子接近时，再一齐开火，好让鬼子尝尝我们的厉害！”全排同志都小声答应说：“排长放心吧！准叫美国鬼子来了回不去！”这时美国鬼子兵已爬近我们工事前三十公尺左右了，我大喊一声：“开火！”于是手榴弹、机枪、卡宾枪便一齐激烈地怒吼了。在这样密集的火力下，美国鬼子在我们阵地前倒下了，后面的敌人来不及还枪，就连滚带爬向山下逃命了。
    当天黑夜，我和二班长商量了一下，决定派出三个战斗小组偷袭敌人；一夜袭击了三次，杀伤了很多敌人。
    第二天一明，美国鬼子就用一个营的兵力，在五辆坦克、五架飞机的配合掩护下向我排猛扑。敌机投下了汽油筒、燃烧弹，我们的阵地到处燃起烈火。在烈火中，我们一次又一次打垮了敌人一共九次的进攻。我们英勇地守卫在山顶上。
    打到中午时，战士们缺乏干粮，弹药也不多了。我立即号召大家节省弹药，放一颗子弹一定要换取一个敌人的生命。炊事员姚学明同志创造了放手榴弹多杀伤敌人的方法：先拉出弦，等看见冒黄烟并听到吱啦声后，再扔出去，这样便可多杀伤敌人。我们就这样地打击敌人。我们坚持到黄昏，已经战斗了三十二小时，共打死了一百五十多个敌人，我们仅付出了轻微的代价。
    我排阵地这时已为敌人四面包围，我们仅剩下五枚手榴弹，四十发子弹了。这时我决定杀出一条道路，突击出去。在突击组的火力支援下，我们突破
    一个缺口，安全地冲出敌人包围圈。经过三天的行军，我们回到了连队。在评功会上，我们被上级批准为一等功臣排；我为一等功臣。（附图片）
