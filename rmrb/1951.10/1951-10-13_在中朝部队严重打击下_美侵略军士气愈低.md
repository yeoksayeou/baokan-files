　　[Xinhua News Agency, October 12th] TASS, Pyongyang, October 10th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the anti-war sentiment among U.S. and British aggressor troops is growing stronger after suffering heavy losses on the Korean front. A reporter from the Korean Central News Agency cited his conversations with recently captured American soldiers by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as an example. A sergeant from the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division admitted that the number of American soldiers deserting has recently increased compared to before. The sergeant said: The armistice negotiations originally raised great hopes among the soldiers; however, when the U.S. side took measures to obstruct the negotiations, they felt very frustrated. The sergeant said: In May, the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division received 6,000 men to replenish the killed soldiers. After this, the division suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Dali Mountain (transliteration). His regiment originally had 1,773 soldiers and 72 officers; now, there are only about 1,000 soldiers and 37 officers. According to the sergeant, the 2nd Battalion of the regiment lost three-quarters of its original strength. The sergeant said: They were all terrified when they saw their comrades die in large numbers. He continued: Before they were captured, there were rumors that another regiment would be transferred to replace their regiment by October 15th. They then tried to save their lives. Some people told them that if they were captured by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they would be killed. However, after they were captured, they were treated humanely.
　　The sergeant said: The policy of the U.S. ruling clique to make the American people cannon fodder and push them into the abyss of aggressive war made them feel indignant.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, October 11th] According to the Prague Telecommunications Agency on October 10th: American newspapers continue to reveal that senior American military authorities have different opinions on the Korean War. "U.S. News & World Report" said in its September 7th issue: "Some of our senior military strategists still believe that the United States made a mistake in using ground troops in Korea. They emphasize that our forces are dispersed in a place that offers few benefits. From a purely military point of view, they suggest withdrawal."

    在中朝部队严重打击下
    美侵略军士气愈低
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社平壤十日讯：据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：美、英侵略军在朝鲜前线遭受重大损失后，美、英侵略军士兵的厌战情绪，正愈来愈强烈。朝鲜中央通讯社记者援引他和最近被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军俘虏的美国士兵的谈话为例。美军第二师的一个中士承认：最近美国士兵逃跑的人数较前增加。这个中士说：停火谈判本来在士兵中间引起了很大的希望；但是，当美方采取阻挠谈判的手段后，他们感到很大的沮丧。这个中士说：在五月间，美国第二师得到六千人来补充被击毙的士兵的缺额。在此以后，这一师军队在大理山（译音）战役中受到了很大的损失。他所属的那个团，原来有士兵一千七百七十三人、军官七十二人；现在，只有士兵约一千人、军官三十七人。据这个中士说：该团二营损失了原有兵力的四分之三。这个中士说：当他们看到他们的同伴大批死亡时，他们一个个都心惊胆战。他接着说：在他们未被俘虏以前，有谣言说，到十月十五日，将有另一个团调来替换他们的团。他们于是力求保命。有人对他们说，如果他们被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军俘虏，他们是要被杀死的。但是，他们在被俘以后，却受到人道的待遇。
    这个中士说：美国统治集团使美国老百姓成为炮灰并把他们推入侵略战争深渊的政策，使他们感到愤慨。
    【新华社十一日讯】据电通社布拉格十日讯：美国报刊继续透露美国高级军事当局对于朝鲜战争存在各种分歧意见。“美国新闻与世界报道”在九月七日出版的一期上说：“我国有些高级军事战略家仍旧认为，美国把地面部队用在朝鲜是一个错误。他们强调说，我国的兵力被分散在一个很少有好处的地方。从纯军事的观点来看，他们建议撤出。”
