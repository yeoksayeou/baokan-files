Defending Heights 614
Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Guan Chonggui

I am a light machine gunner in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. During the Fourth Campaign on the Korean battlefield—the defensive battle north of the Han River—I received a Special Merit and became a combat hero.

On February 22nd of this year, our company was ordered to defend the frontline of Heights 614 north of the Han River. Because the mountain was so high and large, we dispersed our forces: the Third Platoon on the left flank, the First Platoon on the right flank, and our Second Platoon in the front. On the 23rd, the enemy launched a reconnaissance attack with a small force, which we repelled. After guarding for a day, the company commander and political instructor discussed and decided that we must also place forces on the forwardmost part of the position. The company commander and political instructor assigned the task of defending this prominent position to our Seventh Squad. The political instructor asked us when assigning the task:

"Comrades, can you hold the position?"

"We can!" we answered together.

"For what?" the political instructor asked again.

"For the Motherland!" our whole squad answered loudly.

After we accepted the task, we dug fortifications for more than two hours, and then it was dawn. From eight o'clock in the morning, the enemy began shelling, and after shelling for more than an hour, they launched an attack on us from both sides with two platoons of troops. When the enemy on the left flank came up, I suddenly fired three bursts of bullets, and the enemy immediately rolled and crawled back, leaving more than a dozen enemy corpses on the hillside.

The enemy's first attack failed, so they shelled the hilltop again. At this time, enemy planes also arrived. Eight P-51 fighter planes flew low, bombing and strafing in turns. In Korea, I had seen so many civilians being bombed to death, and so many houses burned down. As soon as I saw enemy planes, I hated them in my heart. I aimed my machine gun and said to ammunition handler Mark Xin: "I'm going to shoot it down!" "Can you do it?" Comrade Mark Xin asked.

"Yes, the superiors said that light machine guns can shoot down planes!" I said.

So, Comrade Mark Xin filled the magazine with bullets, and I leaned against the fortifications to aim. An enemy plane dived down. I fired a burst head-on, but missed. The first one missed, then the second one came. I changed another magazine, corrected my shooting posture, and aimed my machine gun at the second enemy plane, which was flying lower and lower. I pulled the trigger, "Da, da, da..." Seven bullets were fired in a row, and the enemy plane was hit. The fuselage was emitting black smoke, and it swerved and fell behind the mountain.

The enemy's artillery kept shelling the mountain, probably for another half an hour. Then, the enemy used a platoon of troops to charge the mountain from the front. The battle was fully underway on the frontline of Heights 614. At this time, only one soldier named Lu Jinjun was left in our left-wing rifle group. Although he was the only one left, he still held the position. In front of our Seventh Squad's position, about a company of enemy soldiers charged up. The American devils stared with their eyes wide open and their mouths open, climbing the mountain like clumsy oxen. Seeing that the enemy was less than thirty meters away from us, I cursed, "I'll send you back home!" Immediately, I fired several bursts of bullets in one breath. The heavy machine gun in the distance on the right flank of our squad's position was also firing loudly. We cooperated with each other and beat the enemy into a mess, watching as we killed twenty or thirty of them. The enemy's second attack also failed.

It was already two o'clock in the afternoon. The enemy's artillery fire was even denser and fiercer, shattering the rocks on the mountain, blackening the snow, and stripping the trees bare. My machine gun sight was also destroyed by the bombing. I quickly used a wooden stick to prop up the sight, and the machine gun could still fire. At this time, the enemy drove up two cars. When they were more than a hundred meters away from our position, I used my machine gun to stop the enemy's cars from advancing. The enemy jumped out of the cars to charge, and I killed another seven or eight enemies in a row, repelling the enemy's third charge.

That day, our company firmly held Heights 614 and completed the task assigned to us by our superiors, enabling our friendly neighboring units to successfully insert themselves behind enemy lines and wipe out two artillery battalions of the Li Chengwan bandit army's Eighth Division and the American invading army's Second Division. My light machine gun shot down an American bandit's plane, killed or wounded more than fifty enemies, and held the position, earning me a Special Merit and two Great Merits. Our whole squad also received commendations.

    坚守六一四高地
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  关崇贵
    我是中国人民志愿军的一个轻机枪手。在朝鲜战场上第四次战役——汉江北岸的阻击战中，我立了特等功，成了战斗英雄。
    今年二月二十二日，我们连队奉令在汉江北岸的六一四高地的前沿阻击敌人。因为山又高又大，我们就把兵力分散开：三排在左翼，一排在右翼，我们二排在正面。二十三日敌人以少数兵力作侦察进攻，叫我们打回去了。守了一天，晚上，连长和指导员研究了一下，认为在阵地前沿必须也放上兵力。连长和指导员把这个突出阵地最前沿的守备任务交给了我们七班。指导员向我们交任务时这样问：
    “同志们，能不能守住阵地？”
    “能守住！”我们一起回答。
    “为了什么？”指导员又问。
    “为了祖国！”我们全班大声地回答。
    我们接受了任务后，挖了两个多钟头的工事天就亮了。从早上八点钟，敌人就开始打炮，打了一个多钟头之后，就用两个排的兵力，从两侧向我们进攻。我等左翼的敌人上来时，突然打了三梭子弹，敌人立即连滚带爬地往回跑，山坡上还丢下了十几条敌人的尸首。
    敌人的第一次进攻失败了，就又向山头上打排炮。这时敌机也来了，八架P五十一式的飞机低飞着，轮番轰炸和扫射。我在朝鲜看到多少老百姓都被炸死了，许多房子都被烧光了，我一看见敌机就恨上心来。我把机枪一端，就向弹药手马克新说：“我把它打下来！”“行吗？”马克新同志说。
    “行，上级讲过，轻机枪可以打飞机！”我说。
    于是，马克新同志把梭子压满子弹，我就背靠着工事瞄准。一架敌机俯冲下来了，我迎头打上一梭子，可是没打中。第一架没打中，第二架又来了。我换了另一个梭子，改正了射击姿势，端起机枪向越飞越低的第二架敌机瞄准，一扣扳机，“达、达、达……”一连七发子弹射出去了，敌机被打中了，机身冒着黑烟，一溜歪斜地向山后落下去了。
    敌人的大炮一个劲儿地向山上排射，大概又过了半个钟头，敌人又用一个排的兵力从正前方往山上冲锋。六一四高地前沿全面展开了战斗。这时，我们左翼的步枪组，打得只剩下了一个名叫卢金俊的战士，虽然只剩了他一个人，还是坚守住了阵地。在我们七班阵地前，敌人约有一个连的兵力冲上来了，美国鬼子瞪着眼睛，张着嘴，像笨牛一样地往山上爬。一看敌人离我们不到三十米了，我骂了一声：“送你们回老家吧！”立刻，我一口气猛打了好几梭子弹；在我班阵地右翼远方的重机枪也打的呱呱叫，我们互相配合着，把敌人打得乱成一堆，眼看着打死了二三十个。敌人的第二次进攻又失败了。
    这时已经是下午两点钟了。敌人打来的炮火更密更猛，连山上的石头都打烂了，雪都打黑了，树都打光了，我的机枪标尺也被炸坏了。我赶忙用木棍垫上标尺，机枪还可以打。这时，敌人开来了两辆汽车，在离我们阵地一百多米时，我用机枪阻止了敌人的汽车前进，敌人从车上跳下来冲锋，我又一连打死了七、八个敌人，把敌人的第三次冲锋又打退了。
    这一天，我们连队坚强地守住了六一四高地，完成了上级交给我们的任务，使我们的友邻部队得以顺利地插入敌后，消灭了李承晚匪军第八师和美国侵略军第二师的两个炮兵大队。我这挺轻机枪，在这一天打落了美国强盗的一架飞机，杀伤了五十多个敌人，坚守住了阵地，立了一特功，两大功。我们全班也立了功。
