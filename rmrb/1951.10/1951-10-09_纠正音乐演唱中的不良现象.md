Correcting Unhealthy Phenomena in Musical Performance

According to readers' feedback from various places, there are still some intolerable phenomena in musical performances across the country. Some yellow songs are still being openly broadcast in some places, and some solemn songs have also been distorted and vulgarized. Reader Gui Xin of the "Luda People's Daily" reflected that when the Luda Tianguang Pingju Troupe performed "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" in mid-August, they interspersed many yellow songs and even filled the lyrics of "The Great Communist Party" into "Candy Selling Songs." Some Shanghai radio stations arbitrarily adapt liberation songs in their comedic programs, adding some low-level gimmicks. For example, when singing "People of the World, Unite Tightly," they mix in many jokes. In dance halls in Hankou and Chongqing, there are even terrible phenomena of using "The Internationale" for dancing accompaniment. These intolerable phenomena should attract the attention of cultural and educational departments in various places and be quickly corrected.

    纠正音乐演唱中的不良现象
    根据各地报纸读者的反映，目前各地音乐演唱中还存在着一些不可容忍的现象。若干黄色歌曲仍在某些地方公开播送，若干庄严的歌曲也被歪曲和庸俗化了。“旅大人民日报”读者桂馨反映：旅大天光评剧团在八月中演出“天河配”时，穿插了许多黄色歌曲，还把“伟大的共产党”的歌词填在“卖糖歌曲”里来唱。上海某些电台的滑稽节目中将解放歌曲任意改编，加上些低级噱头。如在唱“全世界人民团结紧”的时候，就夹杂了许多笑话。汉口、重庆的舞厅里，甚至有将“国际歌”伴舞的恶劣现象。这些不可容忍的现象应引起各地文教部门的注意，迅速予以纠正。
