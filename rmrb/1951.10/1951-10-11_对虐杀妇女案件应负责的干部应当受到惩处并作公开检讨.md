    To the Editor:
    Recently, the People's Daily has successively exposed several typical cases of women being killed or committing suicide due to marriage problems. These cases have been handled by the People's Court, and the main perpetrators have been sentenced to death or imprisonment, which is entirely correct and necessary. However, it is surprising that there is no mention of the cadres who should be held responsible in these cases. Clearly, the feudal thinking and bureaucratic style of disregard for human life and the interests of the masses on the part of many cadres should bear serious responsibility. If it were not for these cadres' discrimination or suppression of women and their connivance or protection of criminals, many women would not have died, and the handling of many cases would not have been delayed. The recent instruction issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government on the inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law clearly states: "If cadres condone or protect criminals, or interfere with the freedom of marriage for men and women, thereby contributing to the killing or suicide of women, they should be given appropriate punishment according to the severity of their responsibility." Therefore, we believe that the cadres involved in the following three homicide cases should be punished by the Party and the government (including criticism, warnings, demerits, etc.) and should make public self-criticism in the People's Daily.
    First, the case of Guo Yushan, Qi Songshi, Qi Shoude, and others in Yangjia Village, Cangshan County, Linyi Prefecture, Shandong, who abused and murdered the woman Pan (see the People's Daily, September 1st): Pan had submitted divorce requests to the district and village governments four times. The district Party committee and the district government were well aware of Pan's dangerous situation but failed to take a responsible attitude to protect her. The district Women's Federation also showed indifference to the abuse Pan suffered daily. As a result, Pan was forced to return home and eventually died tragically. The district Party committee secretary, the district head, and the director of the district Women's Federation should make a public self-criticism in the People's Daily.
    Second, the case of Liang Yongshi and his mother killing Liang Anshi in Shaopen Lizhuang Village, Fourth District, Suixian County, Henan (see the People's Daily, October 7th). In this case, Xuan Yuanzunyan, deputy district head of the Fourth District of Suixian County, Chen Beichang, staff member of the Judicial Section of the Suixian County People's Government, Guo Yongfu, head of the Judicial Section, Chen Liquan, former president of the Shangqiu Prefectural People's Court, and Zhang Ze, the succeeding county magistrate, and other relevant personnel, demonstrated an intolerable bureaucratic attitude in the process of handling Liang Anshi's case. In particular, the fact that the Judicial Section of Suixian County illegally detained An Chongshan, the grandfather of the plaintiff Anshi, her father An Chaozhong, and her uncle An Jinzhong, and the fact that the prefectural court repeatedly defied the orders of the Henan Provincial Court, are even more intolerable to the laws of the state. All these cadres should be given due punishment or criticism and should make a public self-criticism in the People's Daily.
    Third, the case of Meng Zhangshi being forced to commit suicide in Hengcheng Village, Xinjie Township, Feixi County, Northern Anhui. The district, township, and village cadres involved in this case not only failed to seek justice for the deceased Meng Zhangshi, but also helped the perpetrators conceal the facts. They should be given appropriate punishment and should make a public self-criticism in the People's Daily.
    We also suggest that local newspapers require the cadres responsible to make public self-criticism in the newspaper whenever cases of women being killed or committing suicide due to marriage problems occur in their localities.
    At the same time, we suggest that local Party committees and publishing organs compile these cases of abuse and murder of women, the handling process, and self-criticisms into small booklets, which should be distributed by people's governments at all levels to county, district, township, and village cadres as one of the documents for studying marriage policies during the inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law.
    Finally, we hope that when the editors of the People's Daily expose these cases of abuse and murder of women in the future, they should criticize those responsible cadres, and there should be some explanation or investigation as to whether those cadres have been properly dealt with, rather than adopting the objectivist attitude of "none of my business" as in the past.
    Readers: Xiao Zihua, Wang Jing
    Editor's Note: We completely agree with the opinions raised by comrades Xiao Zihua and Wang Jing. We lacked serious criticism of the cadres responsible when exposing cases of abuse and murder of women in various localities, and we did not promptly supervise the handling of these cases. This is wrong. We will correct these shortcomings in the future. At the same time, we demand that the cadres involved in the above three homicide cases make public self-criticisms immediately.

### 对虐杀妇女案件应负责的干部应当受到惩处并作公开检讨

专栏：读者来信

    对虐杀妇女案件应负责的干部应当受到惩处并作公开检讨编辑同志：
    最近人民日报先后揭露了几件因婚姻问题而造成妇女被杀与自杀的典型案件，这些案件已经过人民法院的处理，对于主要凶犯已经判处了死刑或徒刑，这是完全正确和必要的。但是令人惊奇的是，对于在这些案件中应该负责的干部并没有丝毫交代。在这些案件中，很明显的，许多干部的封建思想和漠视人命、漠视群众利益的官僚主义作风，应当负严重的责任。不是这些干部的歧视或压制妇女，纵容或包庇凶犯，许多妇女是不致死亡的，许多案件的处置也是不会拖延的。在中央人民政府政务院最近发布的关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示中明确指出： “干部中如有宽纵、袒护罪犯、或干涉男女婚姻自由因而促成妇女被杀或自杀者，应按责任轻重，予以应得的处分。”因此，我们认为下列三个人命案件所涉及的干部，应当受到党和政府的惩处（包括批评、警告、记过等），并在人民日报上作出公开的检讨。
    第一、山东临沂专区苍山县一区杨家庄郭玉山、齐宋氏、齐守德等虐杀妇女潘氏案（见九月一日人民日报）：潘氏曾四次向区、村政府提出离婚的请求，该区区委和区政府明知潘氏的危险处境，而不采取负责的态度来保护她；该区的民主妇女联合会对于潘氏平日所受的虐待，也漠不关心，因此潘氏被迫回家，终遭惨死。该区区委书记、区长、区妇联主任应在人民日报上作公开的检讨。
    第二、河南睢县第四区烧盆李庄村梁永诗母子杀害梁安氏案（见十月七日人民日报）。在这个案件中，睢县第四区副区长轩辕尊言，睢县人民政府司法科科员陈北昌、司法科科长郭永福、商邱专区人民法院前任院长陈丽泉和继任县长张泽以及其他有关人等，在处理梁安氏的案件过程中，表现出不能容忍的官僚主义态度；尤其是睢县司法科非法扣押原告安氏的祖父安崇山，父亲安朝忠，叔父安尽忠三人，专区法院一再违抗河南省法院的命令等事实，更为国家的法纪所不容。以上这些干部都应受到应有的惩处或批评，并应在人民日报上作公开的检讨。
    第三、皖北肥西县新街乡横城村孟张氏被逼自杀案，这个案件中涉及的区、乡、村三级干部，对于孟张氏惨死，不但不为死者伸冤，反而帮助凶犯隐瞒事实，应当受到适当的惩处并应在人民日报上公开检讨。
    我们并建议各地报纸，凡是当地出了妇女因婚姻问题被杀、自杀的案子，一定要应该负责的干部在报上公开检讨。
    同时，我们建议各地党委和出版机关把这些虐杀妇女的案件和处理的经过，和检讨等编印成小册子，由各级人民政府发给县、区、乡、村干部，在检查婚姻法执行情况时，作为学习婚姻政策的文件之一。
    最后，我们希望人民日报编辑同志今后在揭露这些虐杀妇女的案件时，对于那些负有责任的干部应当提出批评，对于那些干部是否受到适当处理应当有所交代或追究，而不要像过去一样地采取“事不关己，高高挂起”的客观主义态度。
    读者  萧子华  王  静
    编者按：我们完全同意萧子华、王静二同志对我们提出的意见。我们在揭露各地虐杀妇女案件时，对负有责任的干部缺乏严肃的批评，对于各该案件的处理也没有及时督促，这是不对的。今后当改正这些缺点。同时，我们要求上述三个人命案件所涉及的干部即作公开检讨。
