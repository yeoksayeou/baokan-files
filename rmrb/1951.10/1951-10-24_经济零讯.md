    Economic Snippets
    ▲ This year, the 13 state farms under the Bohai District Agricultural Reclamation Bureau have generally achieved a bumper harvest of rice. The highest yield reached 1,450 jin per mu, and the average yield per mu is expected to reach over 540 jin, an increase of 25% compared to last year.
    ▲ In the Xichang Special District of Xikang Province, many Yi ethnic villages that previously had no commercial institutions have successively established cooperatives and stores operated by the Yi people themselves. The sales of many local products from the Yi areas have increased, and the supply of daily necessities is becoming increasingly abundant. For example, the amount of edible salt sold to the Yi areas by the Fulin State-owned Salt Industry Company each month has increased by nearly two-fifths compared to the first half of the year, and the price of salt in Yi ethnic areas has decreased by more than 15%.

    ▲西康省西昌专区许多过去从来没有商业机构的彝族聚居乡村，已陆续创办了由彝胞自己经营的合作社和商店。彝区的许多土产已有了销路，日用品的供给也日益畅旺。如目前富林国营盐业公司每月销往彝区的食盐，已较上半年增加了将近五分之二，彝族聚居地区的盐价减低百分之十五以上。
