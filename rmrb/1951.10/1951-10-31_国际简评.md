International Brief Commentary

    Japanese People, Rise Up and Shatter the Chains of American Enslavement!

    On September 8th of this year, the American government coerced its forty-seven vassal states to sign the so-called "Treaty of Peace with Japan" in San Francisco, and at the same time signed the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" with the Japanese traitorous Yoshida government. These two treaties are war treaties by which the American imperialists are fostering the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces, and at the same time, they are two chains enslaving the Japanese people. In the separate treaty, the United States not only seized Japan's Ryukyu Islands, Ogasawara Islands, and other islands, but also stipulated that Japan grant the United States "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment," destroying Japan's sovereignty. In the "Security Treaty," the United States also seized the privilege of "stationing its land, sea, and air forces in and around Japan." Even so, these are only part of the clauses by which the United States thoroughly destroys Japan's sovereign independence and harshly enslaves the Japanese people. Today's publication of the secret clauses of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," namely the "Administrative Agreement," is yet another chain around the necks of the Japanese people. This "Administrative Agreement" is ostensibly a technical matter, but it fully exposes the vicious means by which the United States tramples on Japan's independent sovereignty.

    According to the "Administrative Agreement" that the U.S. government and the Yoshida traitorous group have already agreed upon, one can clearly see how vicious the U.S. government's intention to enslave Japan is, and one can also clearly see how hypocritical and shameless the so-called words of granting Japan "full sovereignty" in the U.S.-made Treaty of Peace with Japan are. According to the "General Rights" clause of the agreement, the United States has obtained a series of privileges from the Yoshida government, namely: extraterritoriality, the right of arrest, tariff exemptions, the right of measurement, and so on.

    Not only that, according to senior officials of the Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the secret clauses of the "Security Treaty" also allow U.S. warships and aircraft to freely use Japanese seaports and air force base facilities. For these bases on Japanese territory, Japan must not only "lease them for free" but also "share" the "construction and maintenance costs" of the bases with the United States. In addition, U.S. troops stationed in Japan can also be transferred outside their bases for exercises. This means that the entire territory of Japan will become a training ground for U.S. troops.

    In order to implement the "Security Treaty," the United States and Japan will form a "Joint Committee," which will be chaired by the U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo. This committee will actually be the supreme government of Japan, with the power to "make on-the-spot decisions" on all important issues.

    The American aggressors thought that in this way they could make the Japanese people their docile slaves, but the American aggressors' calculations are wrong. The Japanese people's movement against the separate treaty and the "Security Treaty" is continuing to develop. The Japanese House of Representatives' measures to approve these two war treaties have aroused angry protests from the Japanese people. The "Administrative Agreement" has also been resolutely opposed by the Japanese people. The Japanese people must smash these American chains of enslavement in order to win independence and peace. All peace-loving people in China, Asia, and the world support the just struggle of the Japanese people.

    The American Working Class Should Persist in Strike Struggles

    The strike struggles of dockworkers in New York and Boston in the United States are still ongoing, and the production of the Oak Ridge atomic factory in Tennessee and the Ford atomic factory in Washington State has also come to a standstill due to workers' strikes. In addition, the motor transport industry and electrical workers have also launched strikes. The striking workers have shown an extremely strong fighting will in the struggle.

    On the 26th of this month, U.S. President Truman issued a statement, shamelessly using the so-called "national interest" as an excuse to demand that the striking dockworkers "immediately return to work." However, the striking dockworkers flatly rejected Truman's shameless demand and stated that the strike would continue. There is no doubt that this resolute attitude of the striking workers is completely correct.

    People know that the "national interest" that Truman is talking about is actually the interests of the Wall Street bosses who are making a fortune from the war of aggression against Korea and the arms race, while the blows that American workers have inflicted on the American war plan in their strike struggles are precisely in line with the interests of the American people who demand peace. According to reactionary American news agencies, the New York dockworkers' "twelve-day strike has frozen 300 million dollars worth of materials, including war materials," and "will bring to a standstill all military supplies passing through the port of New York to Korea and other military outposts." This means that the New York dockworkers' strike struggle has directly threatened the U.S. aggressors' military supplies to the Korean front.

    This fact shows that the American working class and the American people have tremendous power in the struggle for peace. As long as they unite widely under the slogan of opposing war and carry out a resolute struggle, they will be able to shake the American plan to launch a new war of aggression. The impact of the New York and Boston dockworkers' strike struggle has powerfully proved this point.

    At the same time, people can also see from this that the American aggressors are increasingly isolated among the people at home and abroad, and their rear is built on a very unstable foundation. It is completely possible to defeat them.

    国际简评
    日本人民起来，打碎美国奴役日本的锁链！
    今年九月八日，美国政府胁迫它的四十七个仆从国家，在旧金山签订了所谓“对日和约”，同时并与日本吉田卖国政府签订了美日“安全条约”。这两个条约是美帝国主义者扶植日本侵略势力再起的战争条约，同时也是奴役日本人民的两条锁链。美国在单独和约中，不但霸占日本的琉球、小笠原等群岛，而且还规定日本给予美国“最惠国待遇”和“国民待遇”，破坏了日本的主权。在“安全条约”中，美国又攫夺了“在日本国内及周围驻扎其陆、海、空军”的特权。虽然如此，这些不过是美国彻底破坏日本主权独立、苛刻奴役日本人民的条款的一部分而已。今天本报所发表的美日“安全条约”中的秘密条款，即“行政协定”，就是美国套在日本人民颈上的又一条锁链。这个“行政协定”表面上是技术性的东西，但是，它充分暴露了美国蹂躏日本独立主权的狠毒手段。
    根据美政府与吉田卖国集团业已商妥的“行政协定”，人们可以清楚地看出美国政府对于奴役日本的用心是多么毒辣，也可以明显地看出美制对日和约中所谓赋予日本“充分主权”的词句是多么虚伪和无耻。按照该协定“一般权利”条款的规定，美国已从吉田政府手中取得了一系列的特权，这就是：治外法权、逮捕权、关税豁免权、测量权等等。
    不仅这样，根据吉田政府外务省高级官员所承认的，“安全条约”秘密条款还允许美军舰只和飞机可以随意使用日本的海港和空军基地设备。对于这些在日本领土上的基地，日本不但要“免费出租”，并且要和美国“分担”基地的“建设费和维持费”。此外，驻日美军还可以调离他们的基地以外去进行演习。这就是说整个日本的国土都将成为美军的练兵场。
    为了履行“安全条约”，美国和日本将组成一个“联合委员会”，委员会主席将由美国驻东京大使担任。这个委员会实际上将是日本的太上政府，在一切重要问题上均有“就地作出决定”的生杀予夺的大权。
    美国侵略者满以为这样就可以使日本人民成为它的驯服的奴隶，但是，美国侵略者的算盘打错了。日本人民反对单独和约及“安全条约”的运动正在继续发展着。日本国会众院批准这两项战争条约的措施，激起了日本人民愤怒的抗议。“行政协定”也遭到日本人民的坚决反对。日本人民为了争取独立与和平必须粉碎这些美国的奴役锁链。全中国、全亚洲、全世界的爱好和平的人民都支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    美国工人阶级应坚持罢工斗争
    美国纽约、波士顿码头工人的罢工斗争仍在坚持中，田纳西州奥克里治原子工厂与华盛顿州福德原子工厂的生产，也因工人的罢工而陷于停顿。此外，汽车运输业与电气工人也举行了罢工。罢工工人在斗争中表现了极为坚强的战斗意志。
    本月二十六日，美国总统杜鲁门发表声明，无耻地以所谓“国家利益”为藉口，要求罢工的码头工人“立即复工”。但是罢工的码头工人断然拒绝了杜鲁门的这一无耻要求，并表示罢工将继续下去。毫无疑问，罢工工人的这种坚决态度是完全正确的。
    人们知道，杜鲁门口中所说的“国家利益”，实际上是从侵朝战争与扩军备战中大发横财的华尔街老板的利益，而美国工人在罢工斗争中所加于美国战争计划的打击，却正符合于要求和平的美国人民的利益。据美国反动通讯社消息，纽约码头工人“为时十二天的罢工，已经冻结了包括作战物资在内的价值三亿元的物资”，并“将使通过纽约港口运往朝鲜及其他军事前哨的全部军事物资陷于停顿”。这就是说：纽约码头工人的罢工斗争，已直接威胁了美国侵略者对朝鲜前线的军事供应。
    这一事实说明了：美国工人阶级与美国人民在争取和平的斗争中，是有着巨大的力量的。他们只要在反对战争的口号下广泛地团结起来，并进行坚决的斗争，就足以动摇美国发动新的侵略战争的计划。纽约、波士顿码头工人在罢工斗争中所造成的影响，极其有力地证明了这一点。
    同时，人们也可以由此看出：美国侵略者在国内外的人民中间已日益孤立，它的后方是建立在极不稳固的基础上。它是完全可以被打败的。
