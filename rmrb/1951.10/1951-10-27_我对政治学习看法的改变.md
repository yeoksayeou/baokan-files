As Chairman Mao said in his opening address at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the current political study of intellectuals, and "ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of all kinds of intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reforms in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization." I never thought before that the ideological remolding of intellectuals was so important. What I am about to say about the changes in my views on political study is merely the initial state of an old intellectual groping towards the light in the darkness.

After liberation, students began political study, and I also audited several reports and read pamphlets like "The History of Social Development." This preliminary study was entirely academic. With curiosity and a detached attitude, I went to see what this theory, which was still new to me, was all about. I remember that I only focused on the wording, emphasizing that the pamphlet's statement of "from ape to man" was too rough, while completely ignoring the trend of social development and its irrefutable laws. In this stage, I only learned a few new terms and gained nothing else.

After that, I joined the school's trade union and came into contact with some comrades who were younger than me but whose political level was far higher than mine. I found that they could analyze problems and handle things. They had a set of skills. So I felt that Marxism-Leninism was indeed useful. At the same time, the astonishing progress in all aspects under the people's regime since liberation also made me realize that the revolutionary theory adhered to by the Communist Party must be a very strong driving force and should be studied. However, I still only scratched the surface and did not delve deeply.

After the launch of the campaign to Resist America and Aid Korea, our volunteers performed earth-shattering feats. They were so heroic, so selfless, so pure. Only people with the most sublime ideals could have such a performance. The students' enthusiastic propaganda and the youth's active enlistment deeply moved me. I realized that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the guides for all actions. The achievements of the motherland in the past two years have been brilliant, attracting worldwide attention. This is the result of the collective efforts of the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Many models have emerged in various regions and industries, and I myself am only participating in this grand event, a bystander watching others' wonderful performances, only cheering from the sidelines. This position made me dissatisfied with myself and moved me to transform myself. Premier Zhou pointed out at the beginning of his report to us: demanding study is demanding transformation. His words deeply touched my heart. I understand that our study is for the purpose of transformation. The amount of our study harvest should be measured by the depth of transformation. If we remain unchanged in our thinking, then study is equivalent to studying for nothing. I must use my brain and link learning with my personal thoughts in order to achieve the goal of transforming my thinking.

In the recent three weeks of study, I also realized one thing, that is, if you want to transform, you must work very hard, you must put in a lot of effort. It is not possible to achieve the effect of transformation by listening to a few reports, reading a few documents, and then putting them aside and not asking about them. Ideological remolding is a revolutionary task, and revolutionary undertakings do not succeed easily. We must regard ideological remolding as an overriding important matter, make it the first priority in our daily work, and work on it very intensively. Steady progress does not mean slow progress, and not being impatient does not mean procrastination!

I also have a preliminary understanding that transformation must rely on the masses, and must borrow the strength of the masses. Mutual criticism certainly cannot be done by one person, and self-criticism cannot be done well behind closed doors. I sincerely welcome comrades to analyze and criticize my opinions.

### 我对政治学习看法的改变

    我对政治学习看法的改变
    北京大学教务长  张景钺
    毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的开会词中提到目前知识分子的政治学习，并且说“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”我从前决未想到知识分子思想改造关系是这样大。下面我所说的对政治学习看法的改变，只不过是一个旧知识分子在黑暗中向着光明摸索时的初期状况。
    解放以后，学生开始政治学习，我也旁听过几次报告，看过社会发展史一类的小册子。这个初步的学习完全是学院式的，我以好奇的心情，旁观的态度，去看看这对我还是新奇的理论究竟说些什么。我记得我那时只在词句上着眼，强调小册子上从猿到人的说法太粗放了，而对于社会发展的趋势，它的不可动摇的规律，却毫不重视。在这个阶段中，我不过学到几个新名词，其他一无所获。
    此后我参加了学校工会工作，在工作中接触一些比我年轻而政治水准远比我高的同志。我发觉他们会分析问题，也会处理事情，他们有一套本领。所以我觉得马克思列宁主义果然有些用处。同时，解放以来，在人民政权下各方面的惊人进步，也使我意识到共产党所服膺的革命理论，必是一种很强的原动力，应当学习。不过我仍旧浅尝辄止，并未深入。
    在抗美援朝的运动发动以后，我们的志愿军做出惊天动地的事迹，他们是那样的英勇，那样的忘我，那样的圣洁，只有具有最崇高理想的人们，才可能有那种表现。学生宣传的热烈，青年从军的踊跃，都使我深深感动。我才认识马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想是一切行动的指南。这两年来祖国的成就，光辉灿烂，使得举世瞩目。这是全国人民在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下集体努力的结果。在各地各行业都涌现出许多模范，而我自己只是躬逢其盛，是一个旁观者，看看别人精彩的表演，只在一旁叫好，这个地位使我对自己不满足，动了我改造自己的念头。周总理为我们作报告时一开头就指出：要求学习就是要求改造。他这句话深深地打动了我的心，我明白我们的学习就是为了改造。我们学习收获的多少，要用改造的深浅去衡量。若是在思想上原封不动，学习就等于白学。我一定要开动脑筋，将学习与个人的思想联系起来以求达到改造思想的目的。
    在最近三星期的学习过程中，我还认识一点，那就是要想改造必得十分努力，必得大下工夫，不是听了几次报告，阅读了几篇文件，事后搁置不问就可以收到改造的效果的。思想改造是革命工作，革命的事业没有轻易成功的。我们要把思想改造的学习当作压倒一切的重要事，要使它在日常工作中占第一位，要很紧张的去作。稳步前进不是缓步前进，不急躁不等于拖延！
    我也初步地认识到改造要依靠群众，要借群众的力量。相互批评当然不能一个人做，自己批评一人关起门来也做不好。我诚恳地欢迎同志们对我的意见分析和批评。
