Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th: All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army advance troops into Tibet sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on National Day. The telegram reads as follows:

    Dear Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

    Today, we are celebrating the great National Day in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. Every commander and fighter is filled with immense joy and happiness. Over the past year, we have implemented the correct ethnic and religious policies you prescribed, closely uniting with the vast number of Tibetan monks, laypeople, and earning their warm support. In particular, under your great inspiration, the Tibetan local government signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," allowing us to peacefully and victoriously enter Lhasa.

    As the people of the whole country warmly celebrate National Day, we hereby assure you that we will resolutely implement the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," closely unite with the Tibetan people, and drive the aggressive forces of imperialism out of Tibet. At the same time, we will rely on our own efforts, participate in production, build transportation infrastructure, and consolidate our southwest national defense.

                                    All Commanders and Fighters of the People's Liberation Army Advance Troops into Tibet
