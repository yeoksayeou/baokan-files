Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The First National Conference on Ethnic Education, convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, which opened on September 20th, concluded on September 28th after nine days of enthusiastic discussion. The conference clearly pointed out that the content of ethnic minority education should be New Democracy, and should adopt forms suitable for the development and progress of all ethnic groups. It also determined that the current stage of national ethnic minority education work should adopt the principles of consolidation, development, rectification, and transformation, respectively, according to the actual conditions of various ethnic minority regions.

In the past two years, all ethnic groups in the country have made considerable progress in political and economic aspects, and have gradually developed conditions for the development of culture and education. However, due to the different specific conditions in various ethnic minority areas, the development of education work is very uneven. For example, in the Yanbian area of ​​Northeast China, which is inhabited by Koreans, 92% of school-age children are enrolled in schools, primary education is close to universal, and secondary education is also very developed. The number of primary and secondary schools in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Province have also increased significantly since liberation. However, in some ethnic minority areas, there are still very few schools, or no schools at all; some ethnic groups only have very simple written languages, or do not have their own written languages. The conference pointed out that in the future, ethnic minority education work must, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program on cultural and educational policies and ethnic policies, gradually overcome this imbalance by various means, so that the culture and education of all ethnic groups in the country can catch up with the most advanced ethnic groups.

The conference pointed out that the central content of current ethnic minority education should be patriotic education, to strengthen the national concept of the people of all ethnic groups and the ideological feelings of love for the people's leaders, to recognize that our motherland is a friendly and cooperative family jointly created by the people of all ethnic groups, that it is the source of the happy life of all ethnic groups, and that we should unite as one, love it, defend it, and actively build it.

The conference believes that the primary task of ethnic minority education work at present should be the training of ethnic minority cadres. In the future, the focus of development and rectification should be placed on primary schools, and attention should be paid to the development of literacy education and supplementary education for young people and adults. Ethnic minorities with commonly used written languages ​​must use their own ethnic languages ​​for teaching in primary and secondary schools. The People's Government should help ethnic groups that do not yet have a written language or whose written language is incomplete to create and enrich their written language. Ethnic minority schools at all levels may set up Chinese language classes based on the principles of voluntariness and need. At the meeting, Zhu Haide, a representative of the Korean ethnic group in Northeast China, and Ni Huade, a representative of the Kazakh ethnic group in Northwest China, used the experience of their own ethnic education work to illustrate the necessity of students in ethnic minority schools learning Chinese, which can not only reduce many difficulties for students of all ethnic groups in further education and employment, but also enable the culture of all ethnic groups to be exchanged and improved more quickly.

The conference suggested that ethnic education administrative institutions should be established or special personnel should be in charge of ethnic minority education affairs within the educational administrative departments of relevant people's governments at all levels to strengthen the leadership of ethnic minority education work.

In addition, the conference also discussed issues such as teacher training, curriculum materials, and the treatment of ethnic minority students in ethnic minority education. The results of these discussions will be recommended to the Ministry of Education and the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for adoption and implementation.

During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De and Li Jishen of the Central People's Government, Vice Premier Guo Moruo of the Government Administration Council, and Deputy Directors Liu Geping and Saifuding of the Nationalities Affairs Commission spoke at the meeting successively.

After the conference, the representatives participated in the National Day celebration ceremony in the capital and visited schools and factories in the capital.

    第一次全国民族教育会议闭幕
    确定目前少数民族教育应以爱国主义为中心内容，以培养少数民族干部为首要任务。
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府教育部召集的第一次全国民族教育会议，从九月二十日开幕，经过九天的热烈讨论，已在九月二十八日闭幕。会议明确指出了少数民族教育应以新民主主义为内容，采取适合于各民族发展和进步的形式；也确定了现阶段全国少数民族教育工作应根据各民族地区的实际情况，分别采取巩固、发展、整顿和改造的方针。
    近两年来，国内各民族在政治、经济方面都有不少的进步，也逐渐有了发展文化教育的条件。但由于各少数民族地区具体情况的不同，教育工作的发展很不平衡。例如东北延边地区的朝鲜族，百分之九十二的学龄儿童都已入学，小学教育已接近普及，中等教育也很发达。内蒙自治区和新疆省的小学和中学，在解放后也都已大量增加。但是也有些少数民族的地区，现在还只有很少的学校，或者没有学校；有些民族仅有很简单的文字，或者还没有自己的文字。会议指出：今后少数民族教育工作必须根据共同纲领关于文化教育政策和民族政策的规定，用各种办法，逐步克服这种不平衡的状态，使全国各民族的文化教育能向最先进的民族看齐。
    会议指出目前全国少数民族教育的中心内容，应该是爱国主义教育，以加强各民族人民的祖国观念和热爱人民领袖的思想感情，认识我们的祖国是各民族人民共同创建的友爱合作的大家庭，它是各族人民幸福生活的源泉，我们应该团结一致，热爱它，保卫它，积极地建设它。
    会议认为：少数民族教育工作目前应以培养少数民族干部为首要任务。今后发展和整顿的重点应放在小学，并注意发展青年和成人的识字教育和补习教育。凡有通用文字的少数民族，小学和中学必须用本民族语文教学。对尚无文字和文字不完备的民族，人民政府应帮助他们创立和充实文字。少数民族各级学校，得根据自愿原则和需要设汉文课。会上，东北朝鲜族代表朱海德、西北哈萨克代表倪华德等都以本民族教育工作的经验，说明了少数民族学校学生学习汉文的必要，这样不但可以减少各民族学生在升学就业上的许多困难，而且可以使各民族的文化更迅速地交流和提高。
    会议建议，有关的各级人民政府的教育行政部门内，应设立民族教育行政机构或设专人掌管少数民族教育事宜，以加强对少数民族教育工作的领导。
    此外，会议对少数民族教育的师资培养、课程教材以及少数民族学生待遇等问题都进行了讨论。这些讨论的结果，将建议中央人民政府教育部和政务院分别采择实施。
    会议中，中央人民政府副主席朱德、李济深，政务院副总理郭沫若，民族事务委员会副主任刘格平、赛福鼎等先后到会讲话。
    会议闭幕后，代表们曾参加了首都国庆节庆祝典礼，并参观了首都的学校、工厂。
