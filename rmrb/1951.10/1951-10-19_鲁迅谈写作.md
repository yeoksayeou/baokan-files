Title: Lu Xun on Writing

    Lu Xun did not believe that books like "Novel Writing Techniques" or "Novel Writing Processes" could really solve problems. "We have yet to hear of an author who learned from 'Novel Writing Techniques'." He also believed that "there are no secrets to creation that can be whispered from one person to another." He never wrote treatises like "Creative Methods" or "My Writing Experience," but many valuable opinions are scattered throughout his posthumous works, which we engaged in writing should regard as guiding principles.

    These valuable opinions can be roughly divided into the following two categories:

    On ideological consciousness and life experience;
    On writing methods, including character depiction, word refinement, sentence refinement, etc.

    Lu Xun repeatedly emphasized that writers from petty-bourgeois backgrounds cannot acquire proletarian ideological consciousness or change their petty-bourgeois nature without undergoing training in actual struggle. He called those petty-bourgeois writers who suddenly transformed overnight "somersaulting petty-bourgeoisie." Such writers "are most likely to distort the revolution." "If they are fighting proletarians, as long as what they write can become a work of art, then no matter what they depict or what materials they use, it will definitely contribute to the present and the future. Why? Because the author himself is a fighter." (Correspondence on Novel Themes)

    Lu Xun pointed out that the foundation of creation is life experience; and so-called life experience includes "what is encountered, seen, and heard" in addition to "what is done." "When an author writes a creation, although it is not necessary to have personally experienced the things in it, it is best to have experienced them. A questioner asks: Then, to write about murder, is it best to have killed someone yourself, and to write about prostitutes, must you also prostitute yourself? The answer is: No. What I mean by experience is what is encountered, seen, and heard, not necessarily what is done, but what is done can naturally be included in it." (Preface to Ye Zi's "Harvest") He clearly distinguished between "personally experiencing" and "experiencing"; he did not advocate reducing the meaning of life experience to personal actions, but he also refuted "understanding" without a basis in life. Writers do not have to personally be thieves to write about stealing, or personally commit adultery to write about adultery. Here, "understanding" certainly plays a role; however, "this is because the writer grew up in the old society, is familiar with the conditions of the old society, and is accustomed to the characters of the old society, so he can understand; he will be incapable of understanding the conditions and characters of the proletariat, with whom he has always had no relationship, or he will turn them into erroneous descriptions. Therefore, revolutionary writers must at least share life with the revolution or deeply feel the pulse of the revolution." (A Glimpse of Shanghai Literature and Art)

    Therefore, he advised the young petty-bourgeois writers of that time who aspired to revolutionary literature to "gradually overcome their own lives and consciousness, and see a new path;" - that is, to throw themselves into the fiery revolutionary struggle, transform their ideological consciousness, and resolutely serve the people. But he also warned them: When their thoughts are not yet mature and their life experience is not yet rich enough, do not swallow things whole or parrot them, "do not forcibly create a sudden revolutionary hero." Based on the objective conditions at the time, he explained that works exposing the darkness of the old society and depicting the characters of the petty-bourgeoisie still had significance "at that time," "but the selection of materials must be strict, and the excavation must be deep. Do not fill a piece with trivial and meaningless events to enjoy the richness of creation. If you write like this, at some point, I expect you will feel finished - although such themes and characters will still exist as remnants even decades later, those who depict and portray them at that time will be a different kind of author with a different kind of view."

    (Correspondence on Novel Themes) Here, the insightful words are: "At some point, I expect you will feel finished." And the reason why you "will feel finished" is not because "such themes and characters" no longer exist, but because the author's thinking stagnates. If thinking stagnates, there can be no new discoveries, and if there are no new discoveries, one will feel "finished." In other words, if a writer from a petty-bourgeois background cannot transform himself and learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, he cannot have a keen sense of new things and will "at some point, feel finished," even if the theme belongs to the petty-bourgeoisie with which he is familiar. Lu Xun's prediction has been proven completely correct by facts today.

    Now let's look at Lu Xun's opinions on writing methods, character depiction, and so on.

    In a short essay entitled "Shouldn't Be Written Like That," he said: "For every well-established great writer, his works, in their entirety, explain 'how one should write.' It's just that it is not easy for readers to see and therefore cannot be understood. Because on the learner's side, it is necessary to know 'shouldn't be written like that,' and only then will it be clear that 'should be written like this.' How do we know 'shouldn't be written like that'? Hryesayev's 'Gogol Research' Chapter 6 answers this question: 'One should understand how one should write from the completed works of great writers; then, the side of how one shouldn't write is probably best learned from the unfinalized manuscripts of the same work. Here, it is as if the artist is teaching us with objects. Just as he points to each line, directly telling us - "Look - this should be deleted. This should be shortened, this should be revised, because it is unnatural. Here, more rendering is needed to make the image more distinct."'" This is indeed a very beneficial learning method, but we in China lack such teaching materials..."

    In "Answering Questions from the Dipper Magazine," "How can creation be good," Lu Xun pointed out: "1. Pay attention to all kinds of things, look more, and don't write when you haven't seen anything. 2. Don't force yourself to write when you can't write. 3. The model is not a specific person, but put together from seeing many. 4. After finishing writing, look at it at least twice, and try to delete dispensable words, sentences, and paragraphs without regret. It is better to shrink the material that can be written into a novel into a sketch than to stretch sketch material into a novel. 5. Read foreign short stories, almost all Eastern European and Northern European works, and also read Japanese works. 6. Do not create adjectives that no one but yourself understands. 7. Do not believe in things like 'Novel Writing Techniques'..."

    In this Q&A, Lu Xun modestly said that although he had written twenty or so short stories, he had never had "preconceived notions," ... but it was difficult to refuse the high regard, so he could only write a little about the trivial things he had experienced. Therefore, item 5 of the Q&A, "Read foreign short stories..." and so on, means that he himself loved to read Eastern European and Northern European works and also read Japanese novels. But apart from this fifth item, which is personal experience, all other items can be said to be golden rules for writing. From the first to the fourth - these four commandments are almost the easiest for each of us to violate, but the degree of violation varies.

    Extending Lu Xun's opinions, the first item, "Look more, and don't write when you haven't seen anything," is asking us to be familiar with various aspects of life, to understand the whole picture first and then delve into a corner; if we have no knowledge of the whole picture, it is impossible to delve into a corner. This principle is often overlooked by people. People often only seek to grasp the specific materials of the corner they want to write about and think that other materials (or knowledge) are irrelevant to them. Doing so can produce a stable and flawless work, but it cannot guarantee that the work will also have profound ideological content. The third item, "model" and so on, is about the method of creating typical characters. Lu Xun also said elsewhere: "Writers have two methods of taking people as models. One is to use one person exclusively, and the words and deeds, not to mention the subtle quirks and the style of clothing, are not changed, which is relatively easy to describe... The second is to take various people and combine them into one... I have always used the latter method." (The "Guan" in "Leaving the Pass") "The True Story of Ah Q"'s "Ah Q" is a ready-made example. The fourth and sixth items are all about the principles of word refinement, sentence refinement, and chapter structure. In this regard, comparing the unfinalized and finalized drafts of the same work by a great writer is the most beneficial learning method.

    Lu Xun repeatedly said that he did not believe in books of the "Novel Writing Techniques" type. He said this not to deny that writing (novels) should have rules, but only to oppose those contrived and artificial, flaunting skills, and actually asking people to split hairs so-called "methods" and "processes" of vulgar books. His Q&A clearly tells us: To write well, one must carefully adhere to several rules. These rules look quite simple and ordinary, far less colorful than "processes" or "techniques," "as if something important is happening," but they are basic principles, and it is certain that one cannot do them without hard work. Here, Lu Xun once again warns us: There is no other shortcut to the path of writing besides honestly and diligently putting in some effort!

    鲁迅谈写作
      茅盾
    鲁迅不相信“小说作法”、“小说法程”一类的书籍真能解决问题。“从‘小说作法’学出来的作者，我们至今还没有听到过。”他又认为“创作是并没有什么秘诀，能够交头接耳，一句话就传授给别一个的。”他并没写过“创作方法”或“我的写作经验”之类的专论，然而有许多宝贵的意见，散见于他的遗著中，是从事写作者的我们应当奉为指南针的。
    这些宝贵的意见，大致可以分为下列二类：
    论思想意识与生活经验的；
    论写作方法的，包括人物描写、炼字、炼句等等。
    鲁迅曾屡次强调指出：小资产阶级出身的作家如果不在实际斗争生活中经过锻炼，就不可能获得无产阶级的思想意识，不可能改变他的小资产阶级的根性。他把那些一夜工夫突变过来的小资产阶级作家，叫做“翻筋斗的小资产阶级”。这样的作家“最容易将革命写歪”。“如果是战斗的无产者，只要所写的是可以成为艺术品的东西，那就无论他所描写的是什么事情，所使用的是什么材料，对于现代以及将来一定是有贡献的意义的。为什么呢？因为作者本身便是一个战斗者。”（关于小说题材的通信）
    鲁迅指出：创作的基础是生活经验；而所谓生活经验是在“所作”以外也包括了“所遇、所见、所闻”的。“作者写出创作来，对于其中的事情，虽然不必亲历过，最好是经历过。诘难者问：那么，写杀人最好是自己杀过人，写妓女还得去卖淫么？答曰：不然。我所谓经历，是所遇、所见、所闻，并不一定是所作，但所作自然也可以包含在里面。”（叶紫作“丰收”序）他把“亲历”和“经历”区别清楚；他不主张把生活经验的意义缩小到个人亲身的所作所为，但也驳斥了没有生活作基础的“体察”。作家不必亲自去做贼而后能写偷，不必亲自去私通而后能写通奸，在这里，诚然有“体察”在起作用；然而“这是因为作家生长在旧社会里，熟悉了旧社会的情形，看惯了旧社会的人物的缘故，所以他能够体察；对于和他向来没有关系的无产阶级的情形和人物，他就会无能，或者弄成错误的描写了。所以，革命文学家，至少是必须和革命共同着生命，或深切地感受着革命的脉搏的”。（上海文艺之一瞥）
    因此，他劝告当时的有志于革命文学的小资产阶级青年作家，“逐渐克服自己的生活和意识，看见新路；”——就是说，投身于火热的革命斗争，改造自己的思想意识，坚决为人民服务。但他又告诫他们：在思想尚未成熟、生活经验尚未足够丰富的时候，不要生吞活剥，“不必硬造一个突变式的革命英雄”。他就当时的客观条件，说明了暴露旧社会黑暗、描写小资产阶级的人物的作品在“当时”还有存在的意义，“不过选材要严，开掘要深，不可将一点琐屑的没有意思的事故，便填成一篇，以创作丰富自乐。这样写去，到一个时候，我料想必将觉得写完，——虽然这样的题材的人物，即使几十年后，还有作为残滓而存留，但那时来加以描写刻划的，将是别一种作者，别一样看法了。”
    （关于小说题材的通信）在这里，一针见血的话语是：“到一个时候，我料想必将觉得写完。”而所以“必将觉得写完”，并不是“这样的题材的人物”再也没有存留了，而是因为作者的思想停滞不进，思想停滞就不能有新发见，不能有新发见，便会觉得“写完”。换言之，一个小资产阶级出身的作家如果不能改造自己，学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，便不能对于新事物有锐敏的感觉，便会“到一个时候，必将觉得写完”，即使那题材是属于他所熟悉的小资产阶级的。鲁迅这个预见，到今天已由事实证明是完全正确的。
    现在再看鲁迅对于写作方法，人物描写等等的意见。
    他在题为“不应该那么写”的一篇短文内说：“凡是已有定评的大作家，他的作品，全部就说明着‘应该怎样写’。只是读者很不容易看出，也就不能领悟。因为在学习者一方面是必须知道了‘不应该那么写’，这才会明白原来‘应该这么写’的。这‘不应该那么写’如何知道呢？惠列赛耶夫的‘果戈理研究’第六章里答复着这问题：‘应该这么写，必须从大作家们的完成了的作品去领会；那么，不应该那么写这一面，恐怕最好是从那同一作品的未定稿本去学习了。在这里，简直好像艺术家在对我们用实物教授。恰如他指着每一行，直接对我们这样说——‘你看——哪，这是应该删去的。这要缩短，这要改作，因为不自然了。在这里，还得加些渲染，使形象更加显豁些’”，这确是极有益处的学习法，而我们中国却偏偏缺少这样的教材。……”
    在“答北斗杂志社问”，“创作要怎样才会好”，鲁迅指出：“一、留心各样的事情，多看看，不看到一点就写。二、写不出的时候不硬写。三、模特儿不用一个一定的人，看得多了，凑合起来的。四、写完后至少看两遍，竭力将可有可无的字、句、段删去，毫不可惜。宁可将可写小说的材料缩成速写，决不将速写材料拉成小说。五、看外国的短篇小说，几乎全是东欧及北欧作品，也看日本作品。六、不生造除自己外谁也不懂的形容词之类。七、不相信‘小说作法’之类的话……”
    鲁迅在此答问中，谦虚地说自己“虽然做过二十来篇短篇小说，但一向没有‘宿见’，……不过高情难却，所以只得将自己所经验的琐事写一点”。因而答问的第五条“看外国的短篇小说……”云云，是说他自己最爱看东欧北欧的作品，也看日本小说。但除了这第五条是个人经验，其他各条，可以说都是写作的金科玉律。从第一到第四，——这四条戒律，几乎是我们每一个人最容易犯的，不过犯的程度有深有浅而已。
    把鲁迅的意见引伸起来，第一条“多看看，不看到一点就写”，是要我们熟悉多方面的生活，先了解全面而后深入一角；如果对于全面毫无知识，也就不可能深入一角。这个道理往往被人们所忽视。人们往往只求掌握他所要写的一角的具体材料，而认为此外的材料（或知识）都与他无关。这样做，可以写成一篇平稳无疵的作品，但不能保证这作品一定也具有深刻的思想性。第三条“模特儿”云云，是说人物典型的创造的方法。鲁迅在别的地方又曾说：“作家的取人为模特儿，有两法。一是专用一个人，言谈举动，不必说了，连微细的癖性，衣服的式样，也不加改变，这比较的易于描写。……二是杂取种种人，合成一个。……我是一向取后一种法的”。（“出关”的“关”）“阿Q正传”的“阿Q”就是现成的例子。第四、六两条，都是关于炼字、炼句、篇章结构之类的原则。在这方面，比较研究大作家同一作品的未定稿与既定稿，就是最有益的学习方法。
    鲁迅屡次说，他不相信“小说作法”这一类的书籍。他说这样的话，并不是否认了写作（小说）应有法则，而只是反对那些穿凿造作、卖弄技巧，而实际是叫人钻牛角尖的所谓“作法”、“法程”一类的庸俗的书籍。他的答问，明明告诉我们：写作要好，必须谨守若干法则。这些法则，看去颇为简易、平凡，远不及“法程”或“作法”之类那样五花八门，“像煞有介事”，然而它们却是基本的原则，而且，如果不下苦功，也是一定做不到的。在这里，鲁迅又警告我们：写作之道，除了老老实实、勤勤恳恳下一番工夫，是并无其他捷径的！
