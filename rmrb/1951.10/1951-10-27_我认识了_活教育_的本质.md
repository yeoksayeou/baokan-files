    I Understand the Essence of "Living Education"
    To the Editor:
    After reading Mr. Chen Heqin's "Preliminary Review of 'Living Education'" and Mr. Liu Shi's "Written After Mr. Chen Heqin's 'Preliminary Review'" I was deeply educated.
    A year before liberation, I was studying in the Education Department of Beijing Normal University. At that time, I was very interested in Mr. Chen's "Living Education" curriculum theory and the methodology of "learning by doing, teaching by doing, and seeking progress by doing." In the past, I often thought that politics was dirty and society was dark. Only by working and living with energetic young people or innocent children in the education field all day long could I get some comfort. I fantasized that if I had the opportunity in the future, I would start a living school in a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters, where children could live and learn, get close to nature, and widely absorb knowledge; they would learn whatever they needed in life, even growing vegetables, raising pigs, and managing cooking. In the learning process, children would ask the teacher when they didn't understand, and then do it when they understood. Therefore, when I taught in the normal school department of Jiangxi Provincial Yichun Middle School after graduation, I vigorously promoted this so-called "new type" of "Living Education" theory to the students, hoping that they would be absorbed in "saving the country through education." Little did I know that my self-proclaimed noble act of talking about "saving the country through education" in the classroom was serving the reactionary rulers and acting as a propaganda tool to anesthetize the people.
    After liberation, through two years of political theory study and practical work, I gradually realized that my past attitude of not asking about politics and educating for the sake of education was actually serving the ruling class. Today, we must ideologically eliminate the residual poison of this reformist educational thought of "supra-political" and "supra-class" and conscientiously implement the New Democratic education policy and tasks in educational work.

### 我认识了“活教育”的本质

    我认识了“活教育”的本质编辑同志：
    读了陈鹤琴先生的“我对‘活教育’的初步检讨”及柳湜先生的“写在陈鹤琴先生的‘初步检讨’之后”等两篇文章，我受到了深刻的教育。
    解放前一年，我在北京师范大学教育系念书。当时，我自己对于陈先生的“活教育”的课程论和“做中学、做中教、做中求进步”的方法论非常感觉兴趣。过去我常想政治是污浊的，社会是黑暗的，只有在教育界中整天和朝气蓬勃的青年或天真烂漫的儿童在一起工作和生活，才能得到些安慰。我幻想将来有机会时选择一个山清水秀景色宜人的地方，自办一所生活学校，让儿童在那里一面生活，一面学习，多多接近大自然，广泛地吸收知识；生活中需要什么就学习什么，甚至于自己种菜、养猪、料理炊事。在学习过程中儿童不懂的地方就去问老师，问懂了又去做。因此，当我毕业后，在江西省立宜春中学师范部教书的时候，我就曾经对学生大事鼓吹这种所谓“新型”的“活教育”理论，希望他们醉心于“教育救国”。殊不知我这种自鸣清高，在教室里夸谈“教育救国”的作法，正是为反动统治者服务，作了他们麻醉人民的宣传工具。
    解放后，经过两年来的政治理论学习和实际工作的锻炼，我逐渐了解到我过去不问政治、为教育而教育的态度实际上就是为统治阶级服务。在今天，我们必须从思想上清除这种“超政治”“超阶级”的改良主义教育思想遗毒，认真地在教育工作中贯彻新民主主义教育的方针和任务。
