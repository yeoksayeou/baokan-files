Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: TASS, 18th Dispatch, Tokyo News: The protest movement against the imminent ratification of the separate peace treaty and the aggressive US-Japan military agreement is expanding in Japan. Trade unions are actively participating in this movement.

According to newspapers, the Tokyo Peace Committee held a meeting on September 29th to discuss preparations for convening a trade union conference dedicated to the struggle for peace. The meeting decided to demand that members of the National Assembly vote against the ratification of the separate peace treaty and the US-Japan military agreement.

Representatives of twelve industrial trade unions—who are also members of the wage increase struggle committee—passed a resolution at a meeting on September 26th to participate in the struggle against the separate peace treaty, against the rearmament of Japan, and against the so-called "Public Security" measures being formulated by the government.

"Autonomous Labor News" said that the Central Committee of the All Japan Federation of Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Unions held a plenary meeting on September 21st and 22nd. The meeting unanimously decided to oppose the ratification of the separate peace treaty and the rearmament of Japan, and to advocate the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.

"All Communication News" reported that the Tokyo branch of the All Japan Communication Workers' Union held a representative conference on October 4th and 5th. The conference resolved to step up the struggle for a comprehensive peace, against the rearmament of Japan, and against the US-Japan military agreement. The conference decided not to participate in the splittist "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions". The Hokkaido branch of the above-mentioned trade union also made a similar decision at its representative conference.

In addition, organizations such as the Osaka Transport Workers' Union and the branch of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace established by the Tokyo Automobile Transport Workers' Union have also resolved to oppose the ratification of the separate peace treaty and the "Security Treaty".

While most trade unions in Japan have risen up to oppose the ratification of the separate peace treaty and the US-Japan military agreement, right-wing socialists and their allies—union bureaucrats from the Japanese Trade Union Congress, such as Hoshika, Kikukawa, Matsuoka, and others—are betraying the interests of the working people and siding with the reactionaries to support the ratification of the separate peace treaty and the "Security Treaty".

The rising movement of the Japanese people to defend peace and national independence has caused unease to the Japanese government and the US occupation authorities. According to "Autonomous Labor News," the US authorities recently summoned representatives of trade union newspapers and forbade them to print any materials related to opposing the separate peace treaty and the so-called "Security Treaty" between the United States and Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: TASS, 20th Dispatch: At the meeting of the Japanese National Assembly discussing the separate peace treaty and the so-called US-Japan "Security Treaty," Communist Party and Labor-Farmer Party members, as well as the famous progressive leader and outstanding peace fighter Ikuo Oyama, delivered speeches. These speakers exposed the aggressive nature of the separate "peace treaty" and "Security Treaty" signed by the Yoshida government against the will of the Japanese people.

Communist Party member Masao Inokuchi said in a speech in the House of Representatives of the National Assembly: After six years of occupation, Japan faces the issue of restoring peaceful relations with other countries. However, the US imperialists are trying to use Japan as a base for war against the peace camp and the Asian countries that are liberating themselves from the shackles of US and British imperialism. In Japan, tens of thousands of fighters for peace, independence, and a comprehensive peace treaty have been thrown into prison under the charge of opposing the occupation authorities. In Japan, the primary task is to restore freedom of speech, release all political prisoners, and give the people the opportunity to freely discuss the treaty, so that the treaty can be concluded in accordance with the will of all Japanese people. Most peace-loving countries—the Soviet Union, China, and other Asian countries that fought against Japan—are not parties to the current treaty. This unfair and illegal treaty imposed on us violates the Potsdam Proclamation. It is a treaty of war, not a treaty of peace and independence. This treaty cannot guarantee friendship with the peoples of Asian countries. The US-Japan military alliance places Japan under American rule.

Masao Inokuchi further pointed out: Yoshida concealed his correspondence with Acheson. Masao Inokuchi said: Acheson stated in a letter to Yoshida that Japan's conclusion of the "Security Treaty" guarantees participation in the Korean War. In this way, Yoshida violated the Constitution, deceived the people, and participated in the Korean War. As a result, Japan will inevitably drag the Japanese people into war in the future.

The conclusion of the US-Japan military treaty stipulating the occupation of Japan by foreign troops completely reduces Japan to the status of the former Manchuria. All important affairs of Japan will be decided by the US-Japan Committee led by the Americans. This shameful treaty is unprecedented.

We demand that the Ryukyu Islands, Amami Islands, and Ogasawara Islands be returned to Japan after all military facilities there have been cleared.

Soviet representative Gromyko's speech at the San Francisco Conference shows that in this regard, the Soviet Union is our reliable friend. The military treaty and rearmament are destroying Japan's economy, further lowering the living standards of the Japanese people, and turning them into slaves. This is a ruthless and cruel treaty. The Japanese people compare all of this with the positions of the Soviet Union and China, which support the unrestricted development of Japan's peaceful industrial sectors, and know who their true friends are.

Yoshida is plunging the Japanese people into an abyss of disaster. It is clear that this policy will turn Japan into a US colony. The Japanese people firmly oppose these treaties that are leading Japan to destruction.

Masao Inokuchi said: "We demand that the Yoshida reactionary government, which is pursuing this policy, resign immediately."

### 日本工会组织积极参加全国性抗议运动  反对批准单独和约和“安全条约”  日共议员在国会痛斥奴役日本的美制和约

    日本工会组织积极参加全国性抗议运动
    反对批准单独和约和“安全条约”
    日共议员在国会痛斥奴役日本的美制和约
     【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社十八日讯：东京消息，反对不久将来批准单独和约和侵略性的美日军事协定的抗议运动，正在日本扩大。工会积极参加了这一运动。
    据报纸说，东京和平委员会在九月二十九日举行会议，讨论召开致力于争取和平的斗争的工会会议的筹备事宜。会议决定要求国会议员投票反对批准单独和约和美日军事协定。
    十二个产业工会的代表们——他们也是要求增加工资斗争委员会的委员——在九月二十六日开会时通过决议，参加反对单独和约、反对重新武装日本以及反对政府正在制订的所谓“公安保障”措施的斗争。
    “自治劳新闻”说，日本自治团体工会总联合会中央委员会在九月二十一和二十二两日举行全体会议。会议一致决定反对批准单独和约和重新武装日本，主张缔结全面和约。
    “全递新闻”报道，全日本递信工人工会东京分会曾在十月四、五两日举行代表大会。会上决议加紧进行要求全面媾和、反对重新武装日本和美日军事协定的斗争。大会决定不参加分裂分子的“国际自由工会联合会”。上述工会北海道分会的代表大会也作了类似的决定。
    此外，大阪运输工人工会、东京汽车运送货物工会成立的日本拥护和平委员会分会等组织，也都决议反对批准单独和约和“安全条约”。
    当日本的大多数工会都起来反对批准单独和约及美日军事协定的时候，右翼社会党人及其盟友——来自日本工会总同盟的工会官僚主义者们，如星加、菊川、松冈及其他人，背叛劳动人民的利益，出来和反动派一道支持批准单独和约及“安全条约”。
    日本人民保卫和平和民族独立的日益高涨的运动，引起了日本政府和美国占领当局的不安。据“自治劳新闻”报道，美国当局最近曾召集工会报纸的代表，禁止他们印发有关反对单独和约及美国和日本之间的所谓“安全条约”的任何材料。
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社二十日讯：在日本国会讨论单独和约和所谓美日“安全条约”的会议上，共产党和劳农党的议员们以及著名的进步领袖、杰出的和平战士大山郁夫都发表了演说。这些发言者揭露了吉田政府违反日本人民的意志所签订的单独“和约”和“安全条约”的侵略性质。
    共产党议员井之口政雄在国会众议院发言说：经过了六年的占领，日本面临着与其他国家恢复和平关系的问题。但是，美帝国主义者正试图利用日本作为基地，以便对和平阵营及正在从美英帝国主义者的束缚中自求解放的亚洲国家进行战争。在日本，成千成万为和平、独立和全面和约而斗争的战士，已经在反对占领当局的罪名下被投入监狱。在日本，首要的任务是恢复言论自由，释放所有的政治犯，给人民以自由讨论和约的机会，以便按照全体日本人民的意志缔结和约。大多数爱好和平的国家——苏联、中国和曾与日本作战的亚洲其他国家，都不是目前和约的缔约国。加在我们身上的这个不公平的非法的和约，违反了波茨坦公告。这是战争的条约，不是和平与独立的条约。这个条约不能保证与亚洲各国人民的友谊。日美军事联盟把日本置于美国人的统治之下。
    井之口政雄进一步指出：吉田隐瞒了他与艾奇逊的通信。井之口政雄说：艾奇逊在致吉田的信件中说明，日本缔结“安全条约”，就是保证参加朝鲜战争。这样吉田就违反宪法、欺骗人民，参加了朝鲜战争。结果，日本将来势必要把日本人民投入战争。
    规定外国军队占领日本的日美军事条约的缔结，把日本完全降到从前的满洲国的地位。日本的一切重要事务，都将由美国人领导的日美委员会来决定。这种耻辱的条约是史无前例的。
    我们要求把琉球、奄美和小笠原群岛在清除了当地的一切军事设备后交还日本。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在旧金山会议上的演说显示：在这方面，苏联是我们可靠的朋友。军事条约和重新武装破坏了日本的经济，使日本人民的生活水准更加降低，并把他们变成奴隶。这是一个无情的、残酷的条约。日本人民把这一切和赞成无限制发展日本和平工业部门的苏联和中国的立场作一对比，知道谁是他们的真正朋友。
    吉田把日本人民投入灾难的深渊。十分明显，这种政策将使日本变成美国的殖民地。日本人民坚决反对这些把日本引向灭亡的条约。
    井之口政雄说：“我们要求奉行这种政策的吉田反动政府立即辞职。”
