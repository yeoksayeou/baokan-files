To the Editor:

    The Suzhou Branch of the China National Grain Corporation recently built a warehouse. The warehouse project was designed and built by the East China Basic Construction Engineering Office and contracted by the Shanghai Qia Xing Construction Company. The Basic Construction Engineering Office also sent an engineering team to supervise the work. The project started on August 12th. However, due to the Qia Xing Construction Company's shoddy workmanship and the engineering team's negligent supervision, shortly after construction began, when the warehouse walls were about two meters high, the company discovered problems such as an unstable foundation, crooked piers, uneven walls, excessively wide mortar joints, and insufficient grouting. After the East China Regional Company of the China National Grain Corporation, the Suzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and other relevant departments inspected the site and confirmed these problems, it was decided that the engineering team would be responsible and would order the Qia Xing Construction Company to rework all the substandard work. However, during the rework process, Qia Xing Construction Company continued to adopt a perfunctory attitude. As a result, when the warehouse walls were completed and the beams were not yet in place, the gable wall of warehouse number four collapsed. I believe that while the Qia Xing Construction Company should bear the primary responsibility for the engineering losses in the warehouse construction project, the Basic Construction Engineering Office should bear the responsibility for inadequate supervision and inspection.

    Editor's Note: The East China Basic Construction Engineering Office blindly trusted the contractor and supervisors, causing repeated errors in the warehouse construction project. This fully demonstrates the Basic Construction Engineering Office's irresponsibility towards state assets. The Basic Construction Engineering Office should conduct a thorough review and handle this matter appropriately.

    中国粮食公司苏州支公司建仓工程一再发生错误编辑同志：
    中国粮食公司苏州支公司最近兴建了仓库一座。该仓库工程由华东基本建设工程处负责设计建筑，上海洽兴营造厂承包，基本建设工程处并派工程队负责监工。工程于八月十二日开始动工，由于洽兴营造厂偷工减料，工程队监工马虎，以致施工不久，仓墙砌到二公尺左右时，公司即发现墙基未打实，屋墩东歪西斜，墙壁凹凸不平，灰缝太宽和灌浆不足等毛病。这些毛病经中国粮食公司华东区公司、苏州专员公署等有关部门往工地检查属实后，即决定要工程队负责，责成洽兴营造厂将不合格的工程全部返工重做。但在返工重做过程中，洽兴营造厂依旧抱着敷衍塞责的态度。因此，当仓墙砌好，梁还没有架齐时，第四号仓的山墙就倒塌了。我认为在建仓工程问题上，洽兴营造厂虽应负工程损失的主要责任，但基本建设工程处应负监督检查不严的责任。

    编者按：华东基本建设工程处盲目信任包商和监工，造成了建仓工程的一再错误。这充分说明了该基本建设工程处对国家资财的不负责任。基本建设工程处应深刻地检查与处理这一件事。
