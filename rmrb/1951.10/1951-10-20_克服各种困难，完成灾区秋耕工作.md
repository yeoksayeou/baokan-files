In the disaster-stricken areas of Chahar Province, due to different work attitudes and methods of cadres, two different situations occurred in the autumn cultivation work. In several counties in southern Chahar, as of October 6, only 8% of the autumn land had been cultivated. Some people sighed and said, "We can't even take care of our mouths;" and the cadres followed suit, shaking their heads and saying, "We can't possibly take care of the autumn cultivation!" In the northern Chahar area, the disaster situation was the most severe this year (some counties and districts only had 20% of the normal harvest), but by the end of September, the area had completed 80% of the autumn cultivation. The leading cadres in these areas did not follow the masses and complain about difficulties, but rather led the masses to find solutions. At the beginning of the autumn cultivation, the leading organs and cadres in these areas grasped the correct principle of combining production for surviving the famine with autumn cultivation, explained to the masses the reason that "if we don't finish cultivating this year, we won't be able to plant next year," and led the masses to solve various problems of exchanging livestock and manpower. They also organized Party members, Youth League members, and model laborers to start autumn cultivation first, breaking the masses' fear that the land was too hard to cultivate. As a result, all kinds of difficulties were solved.

Completing the autumn cultivation (in some areas called winter cultivation) work in disaster-stricken areas is a major event in agricultural production in disaster areas at present, because if it is not finished this year, it will not be possible to plant next year. Of course, there are difficulties in autumn cultivation in disaster areas, such as: the masses are busy surviving the famine, and livestock lack fodder, etc.; however, as long as cadres can face these difficulties squarely, give full play to the revolutionary spirit that revolutionary cadres should have, rely closely on the masses, and lead the masses to overcome difficulties, the task of autumn cultivation can be completed. The experience of autumn cultivation in the northern Chahar area is the most powerful evidence.

    克服各种困难，完成灾区秋耕工作
    察哈尔省受灾地区的秋耕工作，由于干部的工作态度和工作方法不同，发生了两种不同的情况。察哈尔南部的若干县份，到十月六日为止，秋地只耕了百分之八。有些群众唉声叹气地说：“嘴还顾不得”；干部跟着摇摇头说：“那里还顾得秋耕！”察哈尔北部地区，今年灾情最重（有些县、区只有二成年景），但该区到九月底，已完成秋耕百分之八十。这些地区的领导干部，不是跟在群众后面叫困难，而是领导群众想办法。秋耕开始，这些地区的领导机关和干部，就掌握了生产度荒与秋耕结合的正确方针，向群众说明“今年耕不完，明年种不上”的道理，并领导群众解决了畜力与人工换工的各种问题，又组织党员、团员和劳动模范先动手秋耕，打破群众怕地硬耕不动的心理，结果，各种困难都解决了。
    完成受灾地区的秋耕（有些地区叫冬耕）工作，是灾区当前农业生产上的一件大事，因为今年耕不完，明年是种不上的。当然，灾区的秋耕工作有困难，例如：群众忙于度荒，牲畜缺乏草料等等；但是，只要干部能正视这些困难，发挥革命干部应有的革命精神，紧紧依靠群众，领导群众克服困难，是可以完成秋耕任务的。察北地区进行秋耕的经验，就是最有力的证据。
