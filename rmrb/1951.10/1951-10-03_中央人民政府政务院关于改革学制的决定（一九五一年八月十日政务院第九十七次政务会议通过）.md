The original school system in our country (i.e., the system of schools at all levels and types) has many shortcomings. The most important of these is that the cadre schools and various remedial schools and training classes for workers and peasants do not have an applicable position in the school system. The six-year schooling period for primary schools, divided into junior and senior levels, makes it difficult for the children of the broad working people to receive complete primary education. The lack of a definite system for technical schools fails to meet the requirements for cultivating talents for national construction. These shortcomings urgently need to be corrected. At present, complete unification of the national school system still faces some difficulties, but it is necessary and possible to determine the appropriate position of the original and newly established types of schools, reform various unreasonable durations and systems, and connect schools of different levels with each other. This will facilitate the improvement of the cultural level of the broad working people, the further education of worker-peasant cadres, and the promotion of national construction. The current school system in our country is now stipulated as follows:

	(I) Preschool Education

The organization implementing preschool education is the kindergarten. Kindergartens accept children from three to seven years old to ensure their physical and mental health before entering primary school.

Kindergartens should be established first in qualified cities and then gradually promoted.

	(II) Primary Education

Primary education includes primary education for children and primary education for youth and adults. Schools that provide primary education to children are primary schools, which should provide children with a comprehensive basic education. Schools that provide primary education to youth and adults who dropped out of school at an early age are worker-peasant rapid primary schools, spare-time primary schools, and literacy schools (winter schools, literacy classes).

	A. Primary Schools:

The length of schooling in primary schools is five years, implementing a consistent system, and abolishing the two-stage system of junior and senior levels. The standard age for enrollment is seven years old. After graduation, students may enter middle school or other secondary schools after passing an examination.

In order to enable primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to receive appropriate education, primary schools may set up various remedial classes or vocational training classes. Students who have received education in these remedial classes or training classes may enter appropriate grades in secondary schools after passing an examination.

	B. Primary Schools for Youth and Adults:

	1. Worker-Peasant Rapid Primary Schools: The length of schooling is two to three years, enrolling worker-peasant cadres and other out-of-school laborers, providing education equivalent to primary school level. After graduation, students may enter worker-peasant rapid middle schools or other secondary schools after passing an examination.

	2. Spare-Time Primary Schools: Enrolling worker-peasant laborers and other youth and adults, providing spare-time education equivalent to primary school level; the length of schooling is temporarily not specified, and graduation is based on completing the prescribed courses. After graduation, students may enter spare-time middle schools or other secondary schools after passing an examination.

	3. Literacy Schools (Winter Schools, Literacy Classes): With the purpose of eliminating illiteracy, the length of schooling is not fixed.

	(III) Secondary Education

Schools implementing secondary education are various secondary schools, namely middle schools, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, spare-time middle schools, and secondary vocational schools. Middle schools, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, and spare-time middle schools should provide students with comprehensive general cultural knowledge education; secondary vocational schools should implement various types of secondary vocational education according to the needs of national construction.

	A. Middle Schools:

The length of schooling in middle schools is six years, divided into junior and senior levels. The length of schooling for each level is three years, and both levels may be established independently. The teaching content adopts the spirit of a consistent system, while also taking into account the needs of segmentation.

Junior middle schools enroll primary school graduates or those with equivalent education, with the standard enrollment age being twelve years old; after graduation, students may enter senior middle school or other equivalent secondary vocational schools after passing an examination.

Senior middle schools enroll junior middle school graduates or those with equivalent education, with the standard enrollment age being fifteen years old; after graduation, students may enter various institutions of higher education after passing an examination.

They enroll worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers who have participated in revolutionary struggles and production work for a specified number of years and have an educational level equivalent to primary school graduation, providing education equivalent to middle school level. After graduation, they may enter various institutions of higher education after passing an examination.

	C. Spare-Time Middle Schools:

Both levels may be established separately, enrolling graduates from spare-time primary schools or spare-time junior middle schools, or those with equivalent education, providing spare-time education equivalent to junior middle school or senior middle school level. There are no uniform regulations for the age of enrollment.

	(IV) Higher Education
