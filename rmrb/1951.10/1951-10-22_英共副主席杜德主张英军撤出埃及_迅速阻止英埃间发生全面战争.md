    Xinhua News Agency, London, October 19th: TASS reports from London on the 19th: The British Communist Party's Deputy Chairman, Dutt, stated in a speech in Wanstead, near London, that the situation in Egypt is rapidly developing into an undeclared war, but the authorities are using an iron curtain of censorship to isolate the British people from this critical situation. If we want to prevent this situation from developing into a full-scale war between Britain and Egypt, we cannot waste another minute.

    Dutt said that for seventy years, successive British governments have guaranteed the withdrawal from Egypt sixty times. However, they have not fulfilled this promise.

    Dutt concluded: "The only way to seek a peaceful solution in the Middle East and to prevent the loss of more lives is to immediately withdraw our troops and negotiate on all issues on the basis of fully recognizing the sovereignty and equal rights of the countries in the Middle East."

    英共副主席杜德主张英军撤出埃及
    迅速阻止英埃间发生全面战争
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社伦敦十九日讯：英国共产党副主席杜德在伦敦附近的万斯特德发表演说称，埃及的形势正在迅速发展成为不宣而战的战争，可是对于这种危急的情况，当局却利用新闻检查的铁幕把它和英国人民隔绝了。假如我们要阻止这种形势发展成英国和埃及间的全面战争，就不能再放过一分钟的时间。
    杜德说，七十年来，历届英国政府曾经六十次保证过撤出埃及。但是，他们都没有履行这个诺言。
    杜德最后说：“要想在中东谋求得和平解决，要想阻止损失更多的生命，唯一的办法就是马上撤退我们的军队，并在完全承认中东国家的主权和平等权利的基础上，就一切问题进行谈判。”
