Editor's Note: Since this newspaper published "Some Tendencies in Xiao Yemu's Works" (by Chen Yong), "Wenyi Bao" ("Literary Gazette"), "China Youth" and newspapers and periodicals in various regions have launched criticisms of Xiao Yemu's novels. These novels were once accepted by some readers, and some individual works, such as "Between Us Husband and Wife," were relatively popular and were adapted into a film. After exposing and criticizing the petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies of these works, the author and some readers who were influenced by such works have been educated and realized their mistakes. Now we are publishing an examination by the author. We believe that the author's self-criticism and determination to correct mistakes, as well as the literary and art circles' stern criticism of such erroneous ideas, are beneficial to the normal and healthy development of literary and art work.

    For the past few months, the criticism of my works by comrades has been an extremely valuable education for me, and I must conscientiously correct my mistakes.

    First, I would like to talk about my experience in literary activities, and then examine the formation of my errors.

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I did mass work in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. At the same time, I started writing. Most of the works were based on real people and real events, with only slight selection and little processing. Most of them were short stories of about two or three thousand words, and they had no influence on readers.

    After coming to Beijing, I thought to myself that I always wrote poorly, so I decided to write larger-scale works.

    At first, I planned to write novels about the War of Resistance Against Japan and the land reform. I had a lot of materials at hand, and I thought I was familiar with life, but when I started writing, the themes, characters, and life all seemed very unfamiliar, and it was very difficult to write. In the end I couldn't write anything. But I was unwilling to give up; I always remembered that I wanted to write novels.

    While I was feeling confused, I happened to hear an argument that readers in the city didn't like to read novels about the old liberated areas. The reason was that they were too boring, uninteresting, and lacked "human touch." As for whose "taste" and whose "human touch" it was, it was very vague, and I didn't think about this issue. It was also said that life is everywhere, the best novels should write about daily life, and write from the side, which would seem profound. It was also said that in order to win over readers in the city, it was necessary to cater to their tastes first, in order to raise their level. As for what kind of readers in the city, workers? Petty citizens? The bourgeoisie? It was not made clear.

    These arguments are essentially the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie attempting to win over the masses and gain ideological leadership; it is the challenge of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literary and artistic thought to proletarian literary and artistic thought. But I thought it was reasonable. At the same time, I also thought that if I really wrote my novels exactly like the old novels, then there were already many such novels, and there was no need to write them again. And I thought I understood that writing novels was for the revolution; I understood that I wanted to achieve the purpose of educating readers through literary works, so I still had to write about people and things in the revolutionary ranks, but the angle of selection and the writing style were different.

    So, in the autumn of 1949, I wrote "Between Us Husband and Wife"; in the winter of the same year, I wrote "On the Haihe River."

    The original intention of writing "Between Us Husband and Wife" was to express a new character through some daily trivial matters. This character has a firm proletarian stand, clear love and hate, and is irreconcilable with old habits; this character's personality is stubborn and straightforward, but has shortcomings, that is, some impatience and narrowness. But these shortcomings are not essential. This character is Comrade Zhang in the novel. In order to set off this character, I pulled a Li Ke from an intellectual background as a foil.

    When writing this novel and after writing it, I also considered some issues, mainly the character Li Ke. Since he has been reformed, it is somewhat absurd and doesn't make sense. But I thought: what I wrote were some daily trivial matters, not his main side, and it didn't affect the overall picture. At the same time, I thought this novel was mainly about Comrade Zhang; I didn't say Li Ke was good, and in the end he stated that he needed to continue to reform. I thought that in this way, I could explain it.

    As for "On the Haihe River," the original intention was even simpler: at that time, I was working in a factory in Tianjin, and I saw that some young workers were somewhat distressed because they could not have autonomy in marriage. So I made up a story out of thin air to illustrate such a problem: in the new society, as long as you work hard to fight for it, you can achieve autonomy in marriage. But if I only wrote about love, I felt that it was not appropriate, so I interspersed some things about production, learning, the Youth League, and so on.

    But I always felt unsure, because none of my companions had done anything like this before, so after these two novels were published, I was always in a tentative mood.

    But the praise I received after these two novels were published was indeed beyond my expectations. These two novels not only had young intellectual readers, but also worker readers, and even among my companions and old cadres, whether they said it intentionally or unintentionally, many people said they were good.

    So I was very excited, and even a little intoxicated. From then on, my writing speed also changed greatly. In the past, it often took ten and a half months to write a prose of two thousand words; now, I could write six or seven thousand words overnight, and in a hurry, I started writing the novella "Tempering." The original intention of writing this novella was to write about how a young intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background gradually gets reformed in the struggle after participating in the revolution.

    In the meantime, I did receive the advice of Comrade Ding Ling. Comrade Ding Ling said to me: "Between Us Husband and Wife" is written very hypocritically, and it is not okay to continue writing like this. But at that time, I did not accept Comrade Ding Ling's advice. Gradually, I also kept hearing opinions from comrades around me that were dissatisfied with my works, and I myself did feel that something was wrong. In the autumn of 1950, I made two deletions and revisions to "Between Us Husband and Wife," for example: Comrade Zhang no longer scolded people, the urban scenery when Li Ke first entered Beijing and the "jazz music" were deleted, Comrade Zhang "stealing" Li Ke's money and the scene of the couple quarreling were changed, and all the phrases such as "integration of intellectuals and workers and peasants" were deleted. At the end, in Li Ke's "self-criticism," the words "learn from each other's strengths" and other words were deleted, and the adjectives "serious" and "dangerous" were added before Li Ke's confession of his mistakes, and Li Ke was changed to a new cadre who had only participated in the revolution for four or five years, and so on.

    But no matter how I deleted and revised, the result was only moving the surface, and the core remained the same.

    After "On the Haihe River" was published, I also made some revisions, which was to add back all the chapters that the editors had deleted when it was published. And these things that were re-added happened to be the bad examples that comrades often cited when criticizing this thing this time.

    All this shows that I have not yet recognized my mistake.

    Until comrades launched a criticism of my works, I had also tried to add and delete these criticized works, but I didn't really do it. The reason is: after thinking about it, unless all the words are deleted, can the traces of its errors not be seen! I re-read the works I wrote and the articles criticizing my works carefully, and analyzed, pondered, and thought about them. At this time, I really found that I was completely wrong! The comrades' criticisms are correct.

    The above works, no matter what my original writing intentions were, do have serious errors and shortcomings.

    First of all, it seriously distorts the truth of life.

    The objective effect of "Between Us Husband and Wife" is only to tell the reader such a question: our old cadres, whether they are from intellectual backgrounds or from worker-peasant backgrounds, are very ridiculous and terrible! The woman is written as an ignorant shrew; the man is written as a philistine-like character with no revolutionary cadre temperament. Their lives seem to be spent all day arguing, shopping, eating at small stalls... They are not seen working, nor are they seen learning, but they are only seen immersed in trivial matters all day long, unable to extricate themselves. How can such cadres serve the people? How can they master the Party's policies and manage the city? This not only has distance and discrepancies with real life; it is not only a distortion, but a fabrication. Objectively, it is a vicious satire of revolutionary cadres.

    "On the Haihe River" depicts love as the most important thing in life; it is regarded as the driving force for work and study, and everything can even be sacrificed for love. And this extremely wrong view is forcibly placed on a worker Youth League member, dressing him up as a "love supreme" person.

    "Tempering," this novella, not only reverses the true situation in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, wiping out the achievements of the mass struggle, but also distorts the ideological transformation of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. As a result, the protagonist in the book, Ma Jun, after experiencing "all kinds of hardships," still makes mistakes again and again, and has not been reformed in any way. This is obviously contrary to the truth of life; therefore, the original intention to describe the transformation of intellectuals is completely in vain.

    My attitude towards the characters is also wrong. One is towards workers, peasants, and cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds, such as Comrade Zhang in "Between Us Husband and Wife," Bai Laohei and Ding Dafu in "Tempering," etc. My attitude is frivolous, hypocritical, and even playful. When writing about their shortcomings, I am relishing it, adding branches and leaves, fabricating facts, and not hesitating to use satirical techniques to try my best to render them. Even when writing about their good qualities, I also hold a playful attitude: "Ha! Ha! Look how progressive he is!" "Hey! I am really not as good as them! Shame! Shame!" And so on, as if this is praising, but in essence it is satire. The other is, for example, Da Nan and Xiao Hua in "On the Haihe River," etc., their thoughts, feelings, and even their life interests, are completely written as a petty bourgeoisie. The attitude taken towards intellectuals in the revolutionary ranks is also wrong. First of all, it is affirmed that they are full of shortcomings, and then these shortcomings are seized upon to make a big joke. Finally, an abstract conclusion is made for them: "I am moved!" "I want to transform!" "My mistake is really serious!" But neither the essence of these shortcomings is excavated, nor the way to transform is pointed out. Only let them jump around, sigh and cry, as if they are acting in a play, making them embarrassed, and in the end they have not been transformed.

    Therefore, it is by no means accidental that my works have aroused the disgust of comrades and the public outrage of many upright readers.

    This is what the comrades pointed out: my mistake is first of all a matter of position; it is not the position of the proletariat, but the position of the petty bourgeoisie. When this most fundamental problem is mistaken, everything is wrong! Therefore, the truth of life is seriously distorted, the attitude towards the characters—the working people—is frivolous, no sincere feelings can be found, and even the characters are played with. The style of the work is hypocritical, and wherever I write with my heart, it is precisely where I vent low-level tastes to the extreme, so the writing skills are also clumsy. Therefore, this tendency is very dangerous.

    I then pursue the root cause of why I made mistakes.

    At first, I thought that the main reason why my works made mistakes was that they were written too hastily. If I asked people to read and revise a work a few times after it was written, and if it still didn't work, I simply wouldn't publish it, and that would avoid making mistakes. This idea is obviously not comprehensive either. But I didn't even do this. The fact is just the opposite, the shoddy work reached the extreme, for example, "Tempering": I wrote wherever I thought, talked nonsense, did not think, wrote a section and published a section, and after writing it, I didn't even revise it once. When writing about the scene that should describe the mass struggle, I felt that it was not easy to write, so I skimmed over it in a few strokes, intentionally skimping on work. Later, when I couldn't write anymore, I simply copied a section from Comrade Kang Zhuo's short story "Ming An Yue" without changing a word. The main reason for this is that I have extremely impure personal motives, and in order to achieve my goal of becoming famous, I have completely lost my sense of responsibility for the people's cause. This is one of the reasons for the formation of errors. But it is not entirely the case. For example, "Between Us Husband and Wife," the writing process was not hasty, it had been brewing for a year or two, conceived for several months, and it did take a lot of effort. But this work is the most typical one among my bad works.

    I also thought that this was because the themes taken by my works were not right. I shouldn't write about those trivial things that don't show any meaning; I shouldn't write about things I'm not familiar with (for example, writing about workers). The biggest mistake in my works is precisely that I wrote these things that shouldn't be written.

    But why did I have to write these? Comrade Ding Ling said in criticizing "Between Us Husband and Wife": "...Why do you have to write about such a couple? I think this is related to a couple that you are familiar with, who are the models for your novel characters. Then I want to ask you, do you really think that the model you used is a typical example of the integration of workers and peasants? That can't be. If you really feel interested in this model, it's only because you are too sympathetic and like the male protagonist Li Ke too much." (The underlining is added by the author)

    Comrade Ding Ling said: "…You have lived in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region for many years, and you have also done mass work and gone through various exercises. Why did you let a character like Li Ke be so complacent in your works as soon as you arrived in Beijing?..."

    Comrade Ding Ling's words are completely consistent with the situation when I wrote this work. In the year after I entered Beijing, my thoughts were indeed very confused, seriously detached from life and politics, obsessed with trivial matters of life, unable to extricate myself in time, and thought that these trivial matters of life were very meaningful, thinking that Comrade Zhang in "Between Us Husband and Wife" liked to quarrel, scold people, and even was narrow-minded and conservative… Thinking that these were the qualities of a "new" character, but not seeing the essential things about this character. At the same time, I didn't really love this character, but in order to cater to the tastes of some readers, I completely violated my inner voice, so the feelings were very hypocritical. The entire story of this novel was fabricated by me, but the characters did have models. But these two people have fundamental differences compared to what I described. I exaggerated and concentrated the shortcomings of these two people, and as a result, it became their essential things. But from the character of Li Ke, you can see the shadow of some aspects of me.

    And I insisted on writing it into a novel. The result is as Comrade Ding Ling said: "...The characters you describe are dressed up by you on the surface, but this kind of dressing up is only for the sake of making a fool of yourself. Therefore, it is not too much to say that you don't like this female cadre from a worker-peasant background. …Of course, you can criticize some of their shortcomings head-on, as long as you are serious and truly respect these people from the bottom of your heart. Or you have indeed seen this kind of uncultured worker-peasant element that you describe,… Then why do you want to write about her, why do you want to dress her up and give her the banner of a correct revolutionary cadre to make her look ridiculous?" My mistake lies here. It can also be seen here that my attitude is very dishonest, my feelings are hypocritical, and it is knowingly committed.

    Da Nan in "On the Haihe River," his view of love; Ma Jun in "Tempering," his view of peasants, his view of the peasant movement, as well as their thoughts and feelings, to be honest, also belong to me, the author.

    This erroneous tendency in my creation can be seen more or less in my early works. In 1943, Fuping County in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region encountered a serious famine. One day at noon, I passed through a forest and saw a naked child lying under a poplar tree. His limbs were as thin as firewood sticks, the same thickness from top to bottom, and his belly was bulging like a small pot. Next to him was a small basket, and the poplar leaves in the basket were scattered by the wind. He came to pick poplar leaves, and his family might be waiting for him to go back to use the poplar leaves to fill their hunger. However, because of fatigue and hunger, he fell asleep here. When I called him, he didn't wake up, his mouth was half open, and a piece of saliva flowed from the corner of his mouth, his belly rising and falling, and he was sleeping sweetly. Several long-legged ants were crawling on his eyelashes, lips… He didn't even notice. I also saw an old woman's chest was surprisingly shriveled due to hunger, as well as her longing for food… I wrote this in a novel called "The First Lesson," the theme of which was about how people fought against the famine. At the same time, Comrade Kang Zhuo, who worked with me, also wrote a novel on the same theme, called "Tomorrow of Disaster." Comparing these two novels, the latter is not as good as the former in terms of the description of the famine, but the latter is powerful in terms of how people conquer the famine, full of confidence and an optimistic fighting spirit, which can encourage people to move forward. Although the former also wrote about people fighting against the famine, it is abstract and powerless, making people feel that in the face of this famine, they can only wait to die. Later, I once thought about such a question: both are young authors, their cultural level and life experience are similar, they live in the same environment, and they write novels on the same theme, why are the results completely different? At that time, I couldn't solve this problem.

    When I relate this to the mistakes I have made now, the problem is easier to see. Therefore, I feel very uneasy. My mistake is by no means accidental, and it is not just a creative problem.

    I have often heard in the past: if the author himself is not a new person, he can never understand the new person; he will never be able to see the most essential things in life, and he will not even feel responsible for the people's disaster. On the surface, it is "sympathy" and "pity," but in essence, it is viewed as an onlooker, with an appreciative eye. The people's shortcomings have also become things that one enjoys talking about, and exaggerating them becomes the essential things. Then, even if you live in the worker-peasant masses for many years, it is still useless. My experience and my mistakes are an iron proof.

    In my past work, there have also been shortcomings and mistakes, and I have been deeply remorseful after being criticized. Although I have made some corrections and made some progress, it is not thorough. The reason is that I regard my shortcomings and mistakes as personal gains and losses, and regard being criticized as my "misfortune." While feeling pain, I try to "draw strength from personalistic philosophy and personal struggle." Instead of "drawing strength from the communist worldview and from the struggle of the masses." Therefore, I have not "deeply, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly" gone into the mass struggle, but "temporarily, conditionally, and half-heartedly" as if I am a guest. After a long time, things have changed, and I have taken a laissez-faire attitude towards my shortcomings and mistakes. Due to the above reasons, I have never achieved a real transformation on this most fundamental issue—the petty-bourgeois stand.

    Therefore, what is reflected in my works: the distortion of the essence of life, that hypocritical style, that low-level taste, that attitude of playing with characters, and the serious individualistic creative motives; regarding creation as a personal career, as a stepping stone to obtaining personal reputation and status. In order to achieve this goal, I do not hesitate to speculate and be opportunistic, produce shoddy products… That kind of inferior quality is all in my bones. After entering Beijing, when I encountered the challenge of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois reactionary literary and artistic thought to proletarian literary and artistic thought, I not only had no sense of vigilance, but thought it was right. This is because these things were originally in my bones, and it was the result of "internal response and external cooperation." Comrade Ding Ling said: "The petty-bourgeois intellectuals who are unchanged or changed very little are always unwilling to be lonely. They also make revolutions, but if they cannot find the masses in the vast ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers, they will have to return to the ranks of the petty bourgeoisie to find the masses. Or, when he feels difficult to be a soldier who is not very noticed in the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers, he can easily go back to the petty bourgeoisie to show off.…" This is the root cause of my errors.

    The reason why my works make mistakes, in the final analysis, is that my petty-bourgeois stand, viewpoints, thoughts, and feelings have not been effectively transformed. Due to the poison spread by my works, it is difficult to count. In the year or so after I came to Beijing, I carried the burden of a "writer," pretended to be educating young people, swayed around, wore the coat of the proletariat, and sold petty-bourgeois goods, without any self-awareness. Thinking about it now, I really feel ashamed.

    I have indeed reached the very edge of the cliff of error, and I cannot take another step. The problem facing me today is no longer whether to create in the future! I know that in the proletarian ranks, people like me who have extremely strong petty-bourgeois stands, thoughts, feelings, and viewpoints will never have a way out if they are not immediately and effectively transformed. I must make effective transformations, no matter how long the journey is; and no matter how much pain is required to transform myself, I am determined to start all over again, transform myself thoroughly, and obtain a real proletarian stand.

    To this end, I must conscientiously and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, draw a clear line between the proletariat and the non-proletariat, and establish the proletarian stand, viewpoints, and thoughts.

    To this end, I must re-invest myself in the fiery struggle of the masses for a long time, wholeheartedly, and unconditionally, learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn to master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, transform myself from practice, and cultivate my sincere proletarian feelings. Root out my hypocritical qualities. To this end, I must do my work seriously and conscientiously. I must first make myself a true member of the proletariat before I can talk about engaging in creation.

    Finally, I would like to talk about something other than self-criticism.

    I am grateful for the comrades' criticism of my works, because this is not only for the readers, but also for my transformation.

    During this period, I also received many letters sent directly to me by readers, who hoped that I would conscientiously correct my mistakes. Some readers made self-criticisms before me, saying that it was a mistake to like my works in the past. In front of these readers, I feel ashamed and feel the value of this enthusiasm. I will answer everyone with my efforts in the future.

    But at the same time, I also received another kind of letter, although only two or three, in which they hoped that I would persist in my mistakes in a "sympathetic" tone. One of them was sent from Nanjing, signed Jia Bei, but with no mailing address. He said that he had never read any of my works in the past. Since the newspapers and magazines had launched criticisms of my works, he read them carefully one by one. Only then did he discover that I was a writer with "conscience." He said that those criticisms were unfair and "hoped" that I would accept them "critically." No matter how others criticized me, they were still very "supportive." A magazine in a distant place is still praising my articles. In front of these readers, I feel the importance of my responsibility, and I also concretely realize the practical meaning of the three words "tendency." While I feel heartbroken, I also feel the need to be more vigilant.

    I should sincerely explain to those who still express "support" for my works: if you are out of sincere and well-meaning sympathy for my works, then I hope that my self-criticism article can help to correct your views. Your "sympathy" and "support" for me are wrong. What is worthy of your sympathy and support are works that truly serve the working people. If the "praise" and "support" for me are ulterior motives, then I think you will definitely be disappointed. I already clearly know which side the truth is on.

    The errors in my works are a big stain on the course of my literary activities. I will use my efforts to wash away this stain. I will participate in the battle to defend realism in people's literature and art and oppose petty-bourgeois tendencies by reviewing my own works and clearing up the errors of petty-bourgeois viewpoints in the literary and art front.

专栏：

    我一定要切实地改正错误
    萧也牧
    编者按：自本报发表“萧也牧创作的一些倾向”（陈涌作）后，“文艺报”、“中国青年”和各地报刊都展开了对萧也牧的小说的批评。这些小说曾经为一部分读者所接受，其中有个别作品如“我们夫妇之间”，曾经比较地流行，而且被改编为电影。经过揭露并批判了这些作品的小资产阶级思想倾向后，作者和曾经受过这种作品影响的部分读者已经得到了教育，认识了自己的错误。现在我们把作者的一篇检讨发表出来。我们认为作者的自我批评和决心改正错误的精神，以及文艺界对这种错误思想的严正批评，是有益于文艺工作的正常、健康的发展的。
    几个月来，同志们对我的作品所进行的批评，我认为这对我是一个极其宝贵的教育，我一定要切实地改正我的错误。
    我先谈一下我从事文学活动的经过，从而检查到错误的形成。
    抗日战争时期，我在晋察冀边区做群众工作，同时，开始写作。所写的作品，取材大半是真人真事，略加取舍，很少加工。大部是二三千字左右的短篇，在读者中并无影响。
    来北京以后，自思写来写去，总是写不好，于是下决心要写规模较大一点的作品。
    开头，我打算要写关于抗日战争和土地改革的小说，手头的材料确实不少，自以为生活也熟悉，但一动手，不论题材、人物、生活，都显得很生疏，写起来非常吃力，终久写不出来。但不写，又不甘心；总还是念念不忘地要写小说。
    我正感困惑时，恰好听到一种议论，据说城市里的读者不大喜欢读老解放区的小说。原因是读起来很枯燥，没趣味，没“人情味”。至于什么人的“趣味”，什么人的“人情”，则说得很模糊，我也没有想这个问题。又说：生活随处都有，最好的小说要写日常生活，要从侧面写，这才显得深刻。又说：为了争取城市里的读者，必先迎合他们的胃口，才能提高他们的水平。至于城市里的什么读者，工人？小市民？资产阶级？则没有说清楚。
    这些议论，实质上是资产阶级、小资产阶级企图争取群众、争取思想领导；是资产阶级、小资产阶级的文艺思想向无产阶级文艺思想的挑战。但我却反以为是有道理的。同时，我也想到，如果当真把自己的小说写成和旧的小说一模一样，那么，这样的小说，已经有了不少，不必再写了。并且自以为懂得写小说是为了革命；懂得要通过文艺作品达到教育读者的目的的，所以也还是要写革命队伍里的人和事，只是取材的角度不同，写法不同而已。
    于是，在一九四九年秋天，我写了“我们夫妇之间”；同年冬天，写了“海河边上”。
    写“我们夫妇之间”的原来企图是：通过一些日常生活琐事，来表现一个新的人物。这个人物有着坚定的无产阶级的立场，憎爱分明，和旧的生活习惯不可调和；这个人物的性格是倔强的、直爽的，然而是有缺点的，那就是有些急躁，有些狭隘。但这些缺点并非是本质的。这个人物就是小说中的张同志。为了烘托这个人物，拉了个知识分子出身的李克来作陪衬。
    在写这篇小说的时候以及写好之后，我也曾经考虑到一些问题，主要的是李克这个人物。他既然是经过改造的，然而确有些荒唐，说不过去。但我想：所写的都是些日常生活琐事，并非是他的主要的一面，并不影响大体。同时，我认为这篇小说主要是写张同志；我也并没有说李克好，最后他还表明自己需要继续改造。我想这样一来，就可以交代得过去了。
    至于“海河边上”这一篇，原来的意图那就更简单：当时，我在天津的工厂里工作，看到有些青年工人，因为婚姻不能自主，感到有些苦恼。于是我就凭空编了一个故事，说明这样一个问题：在新社会里，只要自己努力争取，就能达到婚姻自主。但如果纯粹写恋爱，觉得不像样，于是就穿插上一些生产、学习、青年团等等的事情。
    但总觉得没有十分把握，因为在我的同伴中，还没有像我这样干过的，所以这两篇小说发表以后，总还是怀着试探的心情。
    但这两篇小说发表以后，所得到的赞誉，确是出乎我的意外的。这两篇小说，不仅有青年知识分子的读者，而且还有工人读者，甚至在我的同伴中，以及老干部中，不管他们说的有意无意，总之是有不少人说好的。
    因而我很兴奋，甚至有些陶醉了。从此，我的写作的速度，也大异以前，过去，写一篇二千来字的散文，常常要写十天半月；而今，一夜之间，可写六七千字，于匆忙之间，写起中篇——“锻炼”来了。写这个中篇原来的企图是写一个小资产阶级出身的青年知识分子参加革命以后，怎样在斗争中逐渐得到改造的过程。
    其间，确实也得到了丁玲同志的忠告。丁玲同志对我说：“我们夫妇之间”写得很虚伪，这样写下去是不行的。但当时我并没有接受丁玲同志的忠告。渐渐，在旁的同志中也不断听到对我的作品不满的意见了，自己确也觉得有些不对头了。在一九五○年秋，“我们夫妇之间”这一篇，我曾经作了两次删改，例如：张同志不骂人了，李克一进北京城那段城市景色以及“爵士乐”等等删掉了，张同志“偷”李克的钱以及夫妇吵架的场面改掉了，凡“知识分子和工农结合”等字样删掉了。结尾处，李克的“自我批评”中删去了“取长补短”等字眼，在李克自认的错误之前，加上了“严重”“危险”等形容辞，并且把李克改成参加革命才四五年的一个新干部等等。
    但不管怎样删改，其结果，只动皮毛，筋骨依旧。
    “海河边上”这一篇，发表以后，我也曾作了一些修改，那是把发表时编者所删掉了的章节，全部又增补上去了。而这些重新增补上去的东西，正好是这次同志们批评这篇东西时，常举的坏例子。
    这一切，说明我还没有认识我的错误。
    直到同志们对我的作品展开批评之后，我还曾经试图把这些被批评的作品加以增删，但没有真的这样做。原因是：思索结果，除非要把所有的字句全部删去，才能不见到它的错误的痕迹！我把自己所写的作品以及批评我的作品的文章，重新细读一遍，并加以分析，推敲，思索，这时，我真正发现：我完全错了！同志们的批评是正确的。
    以上这些作品，不论我原来的写作企图如何，确是有着严重的错误和缺点。
    首先是严重地歪曲了生活的真实。
    “我们夫妇之间”这一篇，客观的效果仅仅是告诉了读者这样的一个问题：我们的老干部不论是知识分子出身的也好；工农出身的也好，都是非常的可笑和糟糕！把女的写成了一个愚昧无知的泼妇；把男的写成了一个毫无革命干部气味的市侩式的人物。他们之间的生活仿佛成天是在吵嘴、逛街、吃小摊……既不见他们工作，也不见他们学习，只见他们整日沉没于鸡毛蒜皮的琐事之间，不能自拔。像这样的干部怎样能为人民服务呢？怎么能掌握党的政策和管理城市呢？这和现实的生活不仅是有距离有出入；不仅是歪曲，而是伪造。客观上，对于革命干部是一个恶毒的讽刺。
    “海河边上”这一篇，把恋爱描写成为生活里边最主要的东西；看成是工作、学习的动力，为了恋爱甚至可以牺牲一切的。而把这种极端错误的观点硬安到一个工人青年团员的身上，把他打扮成一个“恋爱至上”者。
    “锻炼”这个中篇，它既颠倒了抗日战争初期的真实的情况，一笔抹杀了群众斗争的功迹，又曲解了小资产阶级知识分子的思想改造。结果，书中的主人公——马军，经过了“千难万苦”，结果仍然是一错再错，未得到任何改造。这显然是违反了生活的真实的；因而，原来企图描写知识分子改造的目的完全落了空。
    对待人物的态度我同样也是错误的。一种是对待工人农民以及工农出身的干部，例如“我们夫妇之间”中的张同志、“锻炼”中的白老黑、丁大富等等，我的态度是轻浮的、虚伪的，甚至是玩弄的态度，写到他们的缺点，则津津有味，增枝添叶，伪造事实，不惜采用讽刺的手法，竭力渲染。甚至写到他们的优良的品质时，也是抱着一种玩弄的态度：“哈！哈！你看他多么进步呵！”“嘿！我真不如他们！惭愧惭愧！”不一而足，仿佛这是在歌颂，但实质上却是在讽刺。另一种例如“海河边上”中的大男、小花等等，则把他们的思想、感情，直至他们的生活趣味，彻头彻尾写成了一个小资产阶级。对于革命队伍中的知识分子，所采取的态度也是错误的，首先肯定了他们混身都是缺点，其次就抓着这些缺点大开玩笑。最后抽象地替他们作了一个结论：“我感动了呵！”“我要改造呵！”“我的错误真严重呵！”但既没有挖掘这些缺点的本质，也没有指出改造的途径。只让他们跳来跳去，叹息流泪，好像是在做戏，弄得狼狈不堪，结果仍然未得改造。
    所以，我的作品引起了同志们的反感和许多正直的读者的公愤，决不是偶然的。
    这就是同志们所指出的：我的错误首先是立场问题；不是无产阶级的立场，而是小资产阶级的立场。这个最根本的问题弄错了，一切都错了！因而严重地歪曲了生活的真实，对待人物——劳动人民的态度是轻率的，找不出一点点真诚的感情，甚至是玩弄了人物。作品的风格是虚伪的，凡所用心写处，也正是发泄低级趣味到了顶点的地方，因而写作的技巧也是拙劣的。所以，这种倾向是很危险的。
    我随即追求我所以形成错误的根源。
    开头，我想我的作品所以犯了错误，主要的原因是写得太草率了，如果写好一篇作品以后，多请人看看，多改几遍，如果还是不行，干脆就不发表，那就可以避免犯错误。这种想法，显然也是不全面的。但连这一点我也没有做到。事实恰恰相反，作品的粗制滥造达于顶点，例如“锻炼”：想到那里写到那里，信口开河，不加思索，写一节发表一节，写好以后，连一遍也没有改。写到应该描写群众斗争的场面，觉得不好写，于是几笔带过，是有意偷工的。写到后来，怎么也写不下去了，于是干脆从康濯同志的短篇“明暗约”里一字未改地照抄一节。所以会这样，主要的原因是自己存在着极端不纯的个人动机，为了达到自己成名的目的，对人民的事业，完全失掉了责任感。这是形成错误的原因之一。但也不完全是这样，例如“我们夫妇之间”这一篇，写作过程倒并不草率的，已酝酿了一二年，构思达数月，确也下过一番功夫的。但这篇作品，在我的坏作品里边，却是最典型的一篇。
    我又想，这是因为我的作品所摄取的题材不对头。我不应该写那些看不出任何意义的鸡毛蒜皮的事；我不该写我不熟悉的事（例如写工人）。我的作品错误最大的，正好是写了这些不该写的。
    但我为什么偏偏要写这一些呢？丁玲同志在批评
    “我们夫妇之间”时说：“……你为什么偏要写这样一对夫妇呢？我想这是同你所熟悉的，作为你小说人物的模特儿的一对夫妇有关的。那我要问你，你对于所采用的模特儿真的觉得是工农结合的典型吗？那不会是的。如果说你真对这模特儿感觉兴趣的话，那也只不过因为你是太同情，太喜欢那男主人公李克罢了。”（点是作者加的）
    丁玲同志说：“………你在晋察冀边区住过不少年，也做过群众工作，经过各种锻炼，为什么一到北京就又让李克这样的人物在你的作品中洋洋得意呢。……”
    丁玲同志的话是完全符合我写这篇作品时的情况的。在我进北京以后的一年间，确实思想上很混乱，严重地脱离生活，脱离了政治，津津于生活琐事，不能及时自拔，并且以为这些生活琐事是很有意义的，把“我们夫妇之间”中的张同志的那些喜欢吵架，骂街，甚至狭隘，保守……以为是“新”人物的品质，而看不出这个人物身上本质的东西。同时，对这个人物，确实也没有真正的爱，而是为了迎合某些读者的趣味，完全违反了自己的内心说话，所以感情是十分虚伪的。这一篇小说，全部的故事是我伪造的，人物却真是有模特儿的。但这两个人比我所描写的，还是有基本上的差别，我是把这两个人的缺点加以夸大和集中，结果变成了他们本质的东西了。但从李克那个人物身上，倒是可以看出我某些方面的暗影。
    而我硬把它写成了一篇小说。结果正如丁玲同志说的：“……你所描写的人物，在表面上你是替她们打扮了一下的，但这种打扮不过为的是出乖卖丑。因此说你是不喜欢这个工农出身的女干部的，并不过分。……当然，你可以正面批评她们某些缺点，只要你是严肃的，真真从心里尊敬这些人。或者你的确看见过像你所描写的这种无修养的工农分子，……那么你为什么要写她呢，为什么又要把她装扮起来，给她插上正确的革命干部的旗子，出她的洋相呢？”我的错误也就在这里。这里也可以看出我的态度是很不老实的，感情是虚伪的，而且是明知故犯的。
    在“海河边上”中的大男，他对恋爱的看法；“锻炼”中的马军，他对农民的看法，对农民运动的看法，以及他们的思想和感情，平心想来，也是属于我这个作者的。
    我在创作上的这种错误的倾向，在我的早期的作品中，或多或少都可以看出来。在一九四三年，晋察冀边区阜平县一带遇到了严重的灾荒，有一天晌午，我从树林子里过，看见在一棵杨树底下，躺着一个赤身裸体的小孩，四肢瘦得像烧火棍，上下一般粗，肚子鼓鼓的像扣着一口小锅。他旁边倒着一只小筐子，筐里的杨树叶被风吹散了。他是来采杨树叶的，家里的人也许正等着他回去用杨叶充饥。然而他因为劳累和饥饿，在这里睡着了。叫他他也不醒，半张着嘴，从嘴角里流出一片涎水，肚子一起一伏，睡得正甜。有几个长脚蚂蚁，在他睫毛上、嘴唇上……爬来爬去，他觉也不觉得。我又看到一个老太太因为饥饿而干瘪得出奇的胸怀以及她那渴望食物的神情……我把这一些写了一篇小说，题目叫“第一课”，主题是写人们怎样和灾荒作斗争的。同时，和我在一起工作的康濯同志，也写了一篇同一主题的小说，题目叫“灾难的明天”。这两篇小说比较起来，论对于灾荒的描写后者还不如前者，但对于人们怎样征服灾荒这一点，后者是有力的，充满着信心以及乐观的战斗的精神，能鼓舞人们前进，但前者虽然也写了人们在和灾荒作斗争，然而是抽象的，无力的，看了使人觉得在这灾荒的面前，只有束手待毙了。后来，我曾经想到这样的一个问题：同是两个青年作者，文化水准、生活经历也仿佛，生活在同一个环境里边，写了同一主题的小说，为什么结果是完全不同的呢？这个问题，当时，我得不到解决。
    我把这事和现在所犯的错误联系起来看，问题也就比较容易看得明白了。因而感到很不安。我的错误决不是偶然的，决不仅仅是一个创作问题。
    过去常听说：作者自己不是一个新人物，决不能对新的人物有所理解；也永远不可能看出生活里边最本质的东西，甚至对人民的灾难，也丝毫没有责任的感觉，表面上看来，是“同情”，是“怜悯”，实质上是以旁观者的姿态，以欣赏的眼光来看待。人民的缺点也就成为自己津津乐道的东西，加以夸大就成为本质的东西了。那么，那怕在工农群众中生活很多年，仍然是没有用处的，我的经历以及我的错误，就是一个铁证。
    在我过去的工作中，也曾发生过缺点和错误，受了批评也是痛悔不已，虽然也作了一些改正，得到了一些进步，然而是不彻底的，原因是把自己的缺点和错误，看成是个人的得失，把受批评看成是自己的“不幸”。在感觉痛苦的同时，就企图“从个人主义哲学和个人奋斗中去吸取力量。”而不是
    “从共产主义的宇宙观中从群众的斗争中去吸取力量。”因而就没有“长期地、无条件地、全身心地”深入到群众斗争中去，而是“暂时地、有条件地、半身心地”仿佛是在作客。日久以后，事过境迁，对自己的缺点和错误又采取了放任的态度。由于以上的原因，致使自己在这个最根本的问题上——小资产阶级立场，始终没有得到切实的改造。
    因此，我的作品里边所反映出来的：对于生活本质的歪曲，那虚伪的风格，那低级趣味，那玩弄人物的态度，以及严重的个人主义的创作动机；把创作看成是个人的事业，看成是获取个人名誉地位的敲门砖。为了达到这个目的，不惜投机取巧、粗制滥造……那种低劣的品质，无一不是我骨头缝里的东西。进了北京以后，遇到资产阶级小资产阶级的反动的文艺思想向无产阶级文艺思想的挑战，自己不但毫无警惕之心，反以为是。这是因为自己的骨子里原来就有这些东西，是“里应外合”的结果。丁玲同志说：“原封不动的或动得非常少的小资产阶级的知识分子，他总是不甘寂寞的。他也革命，但如果他在广大的工农兵队伍里找不到群众时，他就又要回到小资产阶级的行伍里去找群众了。或者，他在工农兵队伍中做个不十分为人注意的战士感觉艰苦时，他也就容易驾轻就熟地回到小资产阶级中去出风头。……”这就是我形成错误的根本原因。
    我的作品所以犯错误，归根结底一句话：是我的小资产阶级立场、观点、思想未得切实改造的结果。由于我的作品所散布的毒害，是难于计数的。在我来北京后一年多时间里边，自己背上“作家”的包袱，装成教育青年的样子，晃来晃去，披着无产阶级的外衣，出卖小资产阶级的货色，而毫无自知之明，至今想来，真正地感觉到惭愧。
    我确实已经走到错误的悬崖的最边沿，不能再走一步了。今天放在我面前的问题，已经不是今后创作不创作的问题了！我知道无产阶级的队伍中，像我那种有着极浓重的小资产阶级立场、思想、感情、观点的人，如果不立刻加以切实的改造，是决不会有出路的。我必须加以切实的改造，不论路途是多么遥远；也不论为了要改造自己，而所需承担的巨大的痛苦，我是有决心一切从头来过，脱胎换骨地改造自己，取得真正的无产阶级的立场的。
    为此，我必须切实地系统地学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，划清无产阶级与非无产阶级的界限，确立无产阶级的立场、观点、思想。
    为此，我必须重新长期地、全身心地、无条件地，投身到烈火般的群众的斗争中去，向工农兵学习，学习掌握马列主义的思想武器，从实践中改造自己，培养自己真诚的无产阶级的感情。根除自己虚伪的品质。为此，我必须严肃地认真地做好工作。应当首先使自己成为一个真正的无产阶级中的一员，然后才能谈到从事创作。
    最后，我想谈一点检讨以外的事。
    我对同志们对我作品的批评是感激的，因为这不仅是为了读者，同时也为了我的改造。
    在这个时期内，我也曾接到了不少读者直接寄给我的信，他们希望我切实改正错误。有些读者先于我作了检讨，他们说：过去喜欢我的作品是一个错误。在这些读者的面前，我感到惭愧的同时，也感到了这种热情的可贵，我当以今后的努力来回答大家。
    但同时，我也接到了另一种信，虽然只两三封，他们以“同情”的口吻，希望我坚持错误。其中有一封是从南京寄来的，署名贾贝，但无通信处。他说：过去，我的作品他一篇也没有读过，自从报纸杂志上对我的作品展开批评以后，才逐篇细读。才发现了我是一个有“良心”的作家。他说：那些批评是不公平的，“希望”我“批判地”接受。不论人家批评得怎样，他们仍然是很“拥护”的。在远地的一本杂志上，则还在赞扬我的文章。在这些读者的面前，我感到我的责任的重大，从而也具体地体会到“倾向性”这三个字的实际意义。在我感到痛心的同时，也感到了有更加提高警惕的必要。
    我应当对于那些到现在还对我的作品表示“拥护”的人们诚恳地说明：假使你们是出于对我的作品的真诚的善意的同情，那么我希望我这篇自我批评的文章能对改正你们的观点有所帮助，你们对我的“同情”和“拥护”是错误的，值得你们同情和拥护的是真正为劳动人民服务的作品。假使对我的“赞扬”和“拥护”是别有用心，那么，我想你们是一定要失望的。我已经清楚地知道真理是在那一面。
    我的作品中的错误，是我文学活动的历程上的一个很大的污点，我当以我的努力来洗刷这个污点。我要通过对我自己作品的检讨，清算文艺战线中的小资产阶级观点的错误，以此来参加保卫人民文艺中的现实主义反对小资产阶级倾向的战斗。
