    I Reported the Special Agent An Tiejian
    The People's Government Has Handled it Responsibly
    To the Editor:
    On March 20th of this year, I reported An Tiejian, a special agent of the Jidong area, and requested the People's Daily to forward it to the relevant authorities for investigation and handling. I received a reply from the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government on March 30th, stating that it had been forwarded to the local public security organs for investigation. I have now received another letter from the Ministry of Public Security dated the 18th of this month, the gist of which is: "The materials you sent to the People's Daily regarding the report of special agent An Tiejian have been forwarded to our ministry. After investigation by the local authorities, the materials were found to be true. After several months of investigation and trial, the An criminal was sentenced to death on September 3rd."
    I was deeply moved after receiving the letter and deeply felt that the current government is truly a people's government, a good government that wholeheartedly serves the people. The People's Government has reasonably handled this issue, allowing me to redress six or seven years of grievance, giving the traitors and special agents who willingly sell out the motherland the punishment they deserve; more importantly, it has avenged the people.
    For this case, I originally wanted to go to the local People's Court in person to file a lawsuit, but because I could not put aside my work and knew that the government was completely trustworthy, I did not go. Now, the facts have proven that my idea was correct. The People's Government is truly a people's government in name and in fact, and it can handle affairs for the people. I have a duty to point this out to the readers, so please publish this letter, hoping that everyone will support the People's Government and assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

### 我投书检举了特务安体俭  人民政府已认真负责处理

    我投书检举了特务安体俭
    人民政府已认真负责处理编辑同志：
    我于今年三月二十日检举冀东特务安体俭，函请人民日报转有关机关调查处理。我已于三月三十日得到中央人民政府公安部的复信，说已转当地公安机关查办。现又接公安部本月十八日的来信，大意是：“你致人民日报社函检举特务安体俭的材料已转来我部，经当地调查材料属实，并经过数月调查审理，已于九月三日将安犯判处死刑。”
    我接到信后非常感动，亲切地体会到现在的政府真是人民的政府，真是全心全意为人民服务的好政府。人民政府合理地处理了这一问题，使我六、七年的冤抑得以平伸，给甘心出卖祖国的汉奸特务们以应得之罪；更重要的是给人民报了仇。
    为了这一案件，我本想亲到当地人民法院去控诉，因不能放下工作，又知道政府是完全可以信赖的，就没有去。现在事实证明了我的想法是对的。人民政府就是名符其实的人民政府，他是能给人民办事的。我有义务向读者们指出这一点来，故请将此信披露，希望大家拥护人民政府，并协助政府镇压反革命。
    读者  王郁芳
