    Coal Mine Leaders Must First Pay Attention to Safety Work

    Safety work is the primary issue in coal mine production. However, the phenomenon of neglecting safety work is still very serious in some coal mines. For example, the Xiangjiang Coal Mine in Hunan Province had a total of 107 accidents, large and small, from June to August, of which 17 were major accidents. For example, production team leader Liu Weichun sacrificed his life in these accidents. On September 3rd, a serious accident occurred at the No. 6 well, halting production for six days, resulting in a loss of more than 1,800 tons of coal, with an estimated loss of over 20 billion yuan. The failure of the mine's leaders to pay attention to safety work is an important reason for the frequent occurrence of accidents at the mine. The mine did not pay attention to checking and improving safety work during the democratic reform movement, so that accidents continued to occur even after the democratic reform.

    The first National Coal Mine Conference in November 1949 had already decided to "strengthen safety work"; and the primary link in strengthening "safety work" is to establish the idea of "safe production" among coal mine workers across the country. The leaders of the Xiangjiang Coal Mine first neglected safety work, so of course they could not do a good job in safety work. We hope that all coal mine workers in the country, especially the leading cadres, will truly establish the idea of "safe production," conscientiously implement the "Coal Mine Technical Safety Regulations (Trial)" promulgated by the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, which came into effect on October 1st this year in all mines, and strive for coal mine production free of accidents.

    煤矿领导干部首先要注意保安工作
    保安工作是煤矿生产中的首要问题。但忽视保安工作的现象在有些煤矿中仍很严重。例如湖南湘江煤矿自六月至八月，共发生大小事故一百零七次，其中有十七次是重大事故。如生产班长刘维春，在这些责任事故中牺牲了。九月三日，第六号井又发生了严重事故，停工六天，少出煤一千八百多吨，估计损失约达二百多亿元。该矿领导干部忽视安全工作，是该矿经常发生责任事故的重要原因。该矿在民主改革运动中，并未注意检查与改进保安工作，以致在民主改革以后，还不断发生责任事故。
    一九四九年十一月全国第一次煤矿会议，早已决定“加强保安工作”；而加强“保安工作”的首要环节，是在全国煤矿职工中树立“安全生产”的思想。湘江煤矿领导干部首先就忽视保安工作，当然就无法作好保安工作了。我们希望全国煤矿职工，首先是领导干部，真正树立“安全生产”的思想，认真执行中央燃料工业部公布、于今年十月一日在全国各矿普遍试行的煤矿技术保安试行规程，为没有责任事故的煤矿生产而奋斗。
