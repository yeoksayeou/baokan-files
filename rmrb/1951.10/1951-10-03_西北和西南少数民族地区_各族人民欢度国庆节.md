More than 300 lamas came from the Chanding Monastery in Shangxia Diebu, near the Sichuan border, more than 800 li away. Yang Danzhu, a monk official in charge of more than 100 monasteries in the region, presented the conference with a peace dove he painted himself to express his congratulations. In the week before National Day, the reporters, propagandists, workers, and students of Dihua City organized themselves to widely promote patriotic education among the people of all ethnic groups in the city. On National Day, more than 70,000 people of all ethnic groups wore their favorite costumes to participate in the celebration meeting, and a torchlight parade was held in the evening. In Kangding City, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, the people of all ethnic groups, in order to celebrate National Day and the entry of the People's Liberation Army's advance troops into Lhasa, resident groups universally studied "The Great Achievements of the Motherland in the Past Two Years" and relevant documents on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and supporting the peaceful entry of the Liberation Army into Tibet. They also carefully checked the implementation of patriotic covenants in each household. More than 8,000 people in the city wore new clothes to hold a celebration meeting. In Kunming, 250,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life participated in the National Day demonstration parade.
