The great Chinese people have launched the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea for a year. Today, at this meeting, on behalf of the Korean people, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people; extend my warm congratulations to the Chinese People's Volunteers who are bravely fighting our common enemy on the front line and have won great victories; pay my high tribute to the glorious martyrs of the Chinese People's Volunteers; extend my cordial condolences to the families of the martyrs and all the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the wounded and sick; and wish the wounded and sick a speedy recovery. At the same time, I would like to express my respect to the Chinese People's Volunteer transport workers, medical teams, and stretcher bearers who have overcome all difficulties and persisted in their work on the Korean front; and express my high respect to all the Chinese people who have provided material relief to Korean disaster victims and donated a large number of weapons to support the front line.

The great movement of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea directly inspired the Korean people's confidence in victory. US imperialism, in its attempt to easily occupy Korea and then invade China, launched a criminal war of aggression. The enemies carried out extremely cruel and inhumane massacres and destruction in Korea. Countless peaceful towns and villages were destroyed, and countless women, children, and the elderly and weak were slaughtered. However, the entire Korean people overcame all difficulties, united as one, and continued to fight the enemy. At this time last year, when the Korean war situation was at a very difficult stage, that is, when the enemy was threatening the Chinese border, the great Chinese People's Volunteers bravely rushed to the Korean front, dealt a severe blow to the enemy, reversed the war situation, and won great victories. The Chinese People's Volunteers not only fought side by side with the Korean People's Army on the front line, but also helped the Korean people in the rear, and thus were loved by the Korean people and were as close as family members. The Chinese People's Volunteers' combat in Korea has strengthened the Korean people's confidence in defeating the enemy a hundredfold. We must overcome all difficulties until we achieve final victory.

The participation of the People's Volunteers in the war and the nationwide movement of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea will never be forgotten by the Korean people. The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the war not only strengthened the Korean people's confidence in victory, but also showed the enemy that the strength of our peace and democracy camp could never be destroyed, and also inspired the oppressed people of the world to rise up and fight for liberation. The strength of our democratic camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is growing stronger day by day, while the strength of the imperialist camp is getting weaker and weaker, and their difficulties are increasing. Therefore, US imperialism was forced to accept the armistice negotiations. However, during the negotiations, they created various excuses to prevent the negotiations from proceeding smoothly. Today, I would like to express at this meeting that the Korean people must resolutely fight to the end until the final victory in order to repay the assistance of the Chinese people. The struggle of the Korean and Chinese people is just, and victory will surely belong to the people of our two countries. The great movement of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea will be immortalized in the common victory of the people of Korea and China. Today, I am here with you to express my gratitude to the peace-loving people all over the world for their support and solidarity. Finally, I would like to express my highest respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, the close friend of the Korean people and the great leader of the Chinese people.

    胜利一定属于朝中两国人民！
    ——李周渊大使在庆祝抗美援朝一周年纪念大会上的讲话
    伟大的中国人民展开抗美援朝运动已经一周年了。今天，在这个大会上，我代表朝鲜人民，向中国人民致以衷心的感谢；向在前线英勇打击我们共同敌人、获得伟大胜利的中国人民志愿军致以热烈的庆贺；向光荣牺牲的中国人民志愿军烈士致以崇高的悼念；向烈士们的家属和全体中国人民志愿军的家属和伤病员致以亲切的慰问；并祝贺伤病员早日恢复健康。同时，向在朝鲜前线克服一切困难、坚持工作的中国人民志愿运输员工、医疗队和担架队员表示敬意；向以物资救济朝鲜灾民和捐献大量武器支援前线的全体中国人民表示崇高的敬意。
    中国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动，直接鼓舞了朝鲜人民的胜利信心。美帝国主义妄想轻易霸占朝鲜，进而侵略中国，发动了罪恶的侵略战争。敌人们在朝鲜进行了极其残忍、惨无人道的屠杀和破坏，无数的和平城镇和乡村被破坏了，无数的妇女、儿童和老弱被屠杀了。但是全体朝鲜人民克服一切的困难，团结一致，继续打击敌人。在去年这个时期，朝鲜战局处在很艰难的时候，也就是敌人威胁中国边境的时候，伟大的中国人民志愿军英勇开赴朝鲜前线，给敌人以严重打击，扭转了战争局势，获得了伟大的胜利。中国人民志愿军不但在前线和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，而且在后方帮助朝鲜人民，因而得到朝鲜人民的热爱，彼此亲如家人。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜作战，百倍地加强了朝鲜人民战胜敌人的信心。我们一定要克服一切困难，直到取得最后胜利为止。
    人民志愿军的参战，中国全国人民的抗美援朝运动，是朝鲜人民永远不会忘记的。中国人民志愿军的参战，不但加强了朝鲜人民的胜利信心，同时也向敌人显示了我们和平民主阵营的力量是决不可被摧毁的，也鼓舞了世界上被压迫的人民起来为解放而斗争。我们以苏联为首的民主阵营的力量正日渐壮大，而帝国主义阵营的力量却越来越弱了，他们的困难是越来越多了。所以美帝国主义被迫接受了停战谈判。但是，在谈判期间，他们又制造各种藉口，使谈判不能顺利进行。今天，我在这个大会上表示，朝鲜人民一定要坚决斗争到底，直到最后胜利，以报答中国人民的援助。朝中人民的斗争是正义的，胜利一定属于我们两国人民。伟大的中国人民的抗美援朝运动，将在朝中两国人民的共同胜利中永垂不朽。今天，我和诸位在一起，对全世界爱好和平的人民所给予我们的支持和声援表示感谢。最后，我向朝鲜人民亲密的朋友、中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席表示最崇高的敬意。
