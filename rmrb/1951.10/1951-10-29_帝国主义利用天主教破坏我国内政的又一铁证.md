Another Ironclad Proof of Imperialism Using Catholicism to Sabotage Our Internal Affairs

    The written order from the imperialist element Wen Guibin to his accomplice Bu Xiangxian is yet another ironclad proof of imperialism using Catholicism to carry out aggression and oppose the People's Government. Wen Guibin issued many reactionary documents during his stay in Tianjin, and this is just one of them.

    This reactionary written order shows how terrified the imperialists are of the awakening of Chinese Catholics, because once the believers' awareness is raised, they will no longer be fooled by them, but will demand to unite and organize to jointly oppose their enemy—the imperialist elements hidden within the church. In order to save their doomed fate, the imperialist elements actually used the religious beliefs of the believers, abused divine power, and barbarically controlled them. They prohibited believers from accepting revolutionary knowledge, prohibited believers from applying to people's schools such as North China University, prohibited believers from participating in people's organizations such as the Youth League, Women's Federation, and Student Union, and the People's Army. They even attempted to prohibit believers from reading people's newspapers; if believers violated these prohibitions, they would "of course be given the statutory punishment of expulsion from the church." That is to say, they want to deprive believers of the sacred freedom to participate in people's organizations, participate in social activities, and read progressive books and newspapers. They neither allow female believers to participate in their own women's organizations, nor allow student believers to participate in their own student organizations. They attempt to use these methods to undermine the unity of the people, instill reactionary ideas, and use believers to engage in various destructive activities. Wen Guibin's reactionary written order fully proves that the imperialists are attempting to turn Chinese Catholicism into an organization that confronts the Chinese people and the People's Government, and to separate Chinese Catholics from the broad masses of the people. Isn't this an ironclad fact that imperialism uses religion to sabotage China's internal affairs?

    Under the smokescreen of "supra-politics," imperialist elements are carrying out the most despicable political conspiracies in the church. This conspiracy has been exposed by many patriotic believers, who have expressed their firm split with the imperialist elements. However, it should be pointed out that there are still a small number of believers who have not fully awakened and still have many confused and erroneous ideas. It should also be pointed out that there are still some imperialist elements hidden in Catholicism who are still inheriting Wen Guibin's mantle, trying every means to fool, threaten, and deceive believers. The Chinese people must not tolerate these activities, must not lower their vigilance, and must not relax the anti-imperialist struggle in religious circles because people like Libere and Wen Guibin have been expelled. It must be known that eliminating these aggressive influences of imperialism is an arduous and complex struggle. This struggle must be persisted in and expanded by patriotic believers across the country, with the support of the broad masses of the people, to thoroughly expose these despicable and dirty activities of the imperialist elements, and to call on all believers to earnestly break with the imperialist elements, actively participate in the patriotic, self-reliant, and innovative movement, and strive to completely sever the ties between Catholicism and imperialism.

### 帝国主义利用天主教破坏我国内政的又一铁证

    帝国主义利用天主教破坏我国内政的又一铁证
    帝国主义分子文贵宾给其同伙卜相贤的手令，是帝国主义利用天主教进行侵略、反对人民政府的又一铁证。文贵宾在留居天津的期间，曾发过许多的反动文件，这只是其中的一件而已。
    这个反动的手令说明，帝国主义是如何恐惧中国天主教徒的觉醒，因为教徒的觉悟一经提高，就不再受他们的愚弄，而要求团结起来，组织起来，共同反对自己的敌人——隐藏在教内的帝国主义分子。帝国主义分子为了挽救他们的灭亡命运，竟利用教徒的宗教信仰，滥用神权，野蛮地控制教徒。他们禁止教徒接受革命知识，禁止教徒投考华北大学等人民的学校，禁止教徒参加青年团、妇女会、学生会等等人民团体和人民军队，他们甚至企图禁止教徒阅读人民的报纸；如果教徒违反了这些禁令，他们就“当然要给予革除教籍的法定处罚”。这就是说，他们要剥夺教徒参加人民团体、参加社会活动以及阅读进步书报的神圣的自由权利。他们既不准妇女教徒参加妇女自己的团体，也不准学生教徒参加学生自己的组织，他们企图借这些方法，以破坏人民内部的团结，灌输反动的思想，并利用教徒从事各种破坏活动。文贵宾这一反动手令十足地证明了帝国主义者是企图把中国天主教变成和中国人民和人民政府相对抗的一种组织，使中国天主教徒和广大人民分离开来。帝国主义利用宗教来破坏中国内政，这难道不是铁的事实吗？
    在“超政治”的烟幕之下，帝国主义分子在教会中进行着最卑劣的政治阴谋。这种阴谋，已经被许多爱国教徒所揭发，他们已经表示和帝国主义分子坚决分裂，但是应该指出仍有一小部分教徒还没有完全觉悟过来，还存在着许多糊涂错误观念。也应该指出：目前尚有一些隐藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子依然继承着文贵宾的衣钵，千方百计地企图愚弄、威胁和欺骗教徒。对于这些活动，中国人民决不能容忍，决不能降低警惕，决不能因为黎培里和文贵宾之流已经被驱逐，因而使宗教界反帝国主义的斗争松懈下来。须知要肃清帝国主义这些侵略影响，是个艰巨、复杂的斗争。这个斗争必须由全国爱国教徒，在广大人民支持之下，坚持下去，扩大开来，把帝国主义分子这些卑鄙龌龊的勾当，彻底揭发出来，并号召一切教徒认真和帝国主义分子决裂，积极参加爱国的自立革新运动，为彻底割断天主教与帝国主义的联系而奋斗。
