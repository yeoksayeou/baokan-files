Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: New York dispatch: On the afternoon of October 7th, despite pouring rain, more than nine thousand citizens of New York City held peaceful rallies simultaneously in three locations in New York City.

These rallies were organized by the United Christian Peace Action Committee, and the participants included people with different religious beliefs and political views. At all three gatherings, a prayer drafted by the committee was read, calling for an end to the Korean War and appealing for peace. Many speakers at the meetings condemned the bipartisan war-mongers and urged the establishment of a strong people's peace alliance. They were warmly welcomed by the attendees. Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois, the renowned Black historian who is being persecuted in every way by the US government, spoke at the rally in front of the Rochambeau Apartments, denouncing the massive US military budget. He said: "No country can conquer the world by spending 60 billion dollars a year." He pointed out that the Soviet Union had never attacked the United States, while the United States had invaded the Soviet Union after the First World War; the United States is the only country in the world that has used atomic bombs to slaughter unarmed women and children. He reminded people that 800 million people are living freely under the leadership of the Communist Party, and no atomic bomb can change them. Professor Morrison, a nuclear physicist, said: "The decision not to use atomic weapons is not the decision of military generals, but the decision of ordinary people around the world." Vitanis, the secretary of the Armenian National Committee and a Presbyterian pastor, said: "The United States is now viewed with suspicion and fear by the rest of the world, and we cannot build peace on the basis of anti-communism." Other speakers at the meeting included Glasgow, the youth director of the American Peace Crusade; Beverley, the chairman of the American Women for Peace Association; Mau Hyde, the secretary of the Women's Peace Committee; and Sackley, the editor and publisher of the New York *Compass* newspaper.

TASS, New York, October 6th: Ten prominent Americans have sent a letter to UN Assistant Secretary-General Cohen, asking him to answer what efforts the United Nations is making to ensure the successful completion of the Korean negotiations. They asked whether the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, or other responsible UN bodies intend to take any steps to restore peace in Korea. They expressed anxiety over the stalemate that has formed in the negotiations. They asked: General Van Fleet said that the "UN forces" intend to "eliminate" the North Korean army on a large scale. Did the UN and the UN Secretariat preview this statement? Does this statement not violate the "moral and humanitarian purposes and the obligations of the United Nations"?

The signatories of this letter include Albers, the secretary of the Episcopal Church Social Action Alliance, Professor Morrison, Robertson, and Mau Hyde, the secretary of the Women's Peace Committee.

    美国纽约市三个地方同时举行和平集会
    斥责美国战争政策要求停止侵朝

    【新华社十日讯】纽约消息：纽约九千多市民七日下午不顾倾盆大雨，在纽约市三个地方同时举行和平集会。
    这些集会是由基督教各教派联合和平行动委员会主办的，参加的群众包括具有不同宗教信仰和不同政治见解的人们。三个会上，都宣读了委员会草拟的祈祷文，要求停止朝鲜战争，呼吁实现和平。会上许多演说者都斥责两党战争制造者，并敦促成立强大的人民和平联盟。他们受到到会群众热烈的欢迎。正受到美国政府百般迫害的著名黑人历史学家杜波依斯博士在罗支兰大厦前的集会上演说，斥责美国庞大的军事预算。他说：“任何国家都不能用每年花费六百亿元的办法来征服世界。”他指出：苏联从未攻击过美国，而美国却在第一次世界大战后侵略过苏联；美国是世界上用原子弹残杀手无寸铁的妇孺的唯一的一个国家。他提醒人们说：有八亿人民在共产党领导下过着自由的生活，任何原子弹都不能使他们改变。原子核物理学家摩里逊教授说：“不使用原子武器的决定不是军事将领们的决定，而是世界普通人民的决定。”亚美尼亚人全国委员会书记、长老会牧师维旦尼斯演说称：“美国现在受到了世界其余部分的怀疑和恐惧，我们不能在反共的基础上建立和平。”其他在会上演说的有：美国和平十字军青年部部长格拉斯哥、美国妇女争取和平协会主席白佛莱、妇女和平委员会秘书毛海黛、纽约《指南针日报》主编与发行人萨克莱等。
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社纽约六日讯：美国十位名流致函联合国秘书长助理柯亨，要他回答联合国在保证朝鲜谈判胜利完成方面作些什么努力的问题。他们问道，联合国大会、安全理事会或者联合国其他负责机关是否打算为恢复朝鲜和平采取什么步骤？他们对已经形成的谈判僵局表示焦虑。他们问道：范佛里特将军说，“联合国军”打算大批“消灭”北朝鲜军，联合国与联合国秘书处是否预问了这项声明？这个声明难道不违背“道义与人道的目的以及联合国的义务吗”？
    这封信的署名人中有圣公会社会活动联盟秘书奥尔伯斯、摩里逊教授、罗伯逊、妇女和平委员会秘书毛海黛等人。
