    The Burmese People Fight to Defend World Peace!
    By Déqīn Lún, Chairman of the Burmese World Peace Defense Congress

    Only six years have passed since the end of World War II. The Burmese people, who suffered more than three years of war, have not yet recovered from the wounds of war. However, the people of the world are once again facing a serious threat of war. To stop this threat of war, we must unite with the people of the world and work together.

    The American imperialists and their lackeys—vassal states seduced and bought with dollars—are plotting to provoke another major war. All the provocative acts of American imperialism do not represent the will of the American people. (This has already been expressed by the American people.) Can the people of the world stand idly by and ignore such war-mongering behavior? No, absolutely not, and they have already realized how to unite and defend themselves. American imperialism arbitrarily uses the United Nations as a tool to invade Korea and harm the Korean people. The peace-loving and war-hating Korean people have tried their best to resolve the Korean issue peacefully, but the peace talks have made no progress due to the American imperialists' sabotage of peace.

    Not only that, but the American imperialists also shamelessly occupy China's territory of Taiwan, constantly violate China's territorial waters and airspace, and even more frantically openly arm German Nazis and Japanese fascists, release war criminals, and, under the pretext of the Japanese Peace Treaty, brazenly carry out a separate peace.

    In any case, the people who suffered from the scourge of war in the past world war have realized the harm of war. If the people of the world want to avoid this war, they must unite and use the power of the people to oppose the aggressive war created by American imperialism. Then, war can be stopped.

    For the Burmese people, the memories of more than three years under the bloody rule of Japanese fascism, where men, women, old and young alike, suffered the horrors of being forced into labor, slapped in the face, exposed to the sun, fingernails pulled out, boiling water poured on them, buried alive... are still fresh.

    Therefore, the Burmese people, regardless of race, religion, political belief, gender, or age, have united for a common goal—the cause of world peace—workers, farmers, students, youth, women, writers, painters, and monks are all united to participate in the struggle for peace in all aspects. Similarly, people's representatives in the parliament and municipal councilors, whether in the parliament or in the municipal meetings, absolutely support the Stockholm Appeal to ban atomic bombs and the resolution of the First Session of the World Peace Council held in Berlin on the signing of a Five-Power Peace Pact; they are constantly striving to stop the aggressive war in Korea and to propose drafts to stop war cries.

    In this struggle against and to stop war, the cunning American imperialists, give the Burmese government "economic cooperation assistance" like poisoned food, raising lackeys who are loyal to American imperialism. After accepting such "assistance," the shortsighted government continues to carry out anti-people measures. This is what we must resolutely oppose and fight against.

    Under the guise of "economic aid," American imperialism expands and builds airports throughout Burma, intensifies the repair of major seaports, and uses newspapers, magazines, radio, movies, and other tools to unscrupulously promote war. American imperialism is also targeting the vanguard against imperialism—the People's Republic of China, which is rapidly advancing towards the goal of world peace under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the mentor of the Asian people—to carry out sabotage.

    The Burmese people are constantly shouldering the responsibility of defending world peace by opposing and打击 [attack] American imperialism, and believe that they have been, still are, and will certainly more resolutely stand on the side of the world peace camp and strive to the end! We firmly believe that the awakening of the people and the power of the people will surely stop all acts that undermine world peace, and the facts have already proved this.

    As Chairman of the Burmese World Peace Defense Congress, I swear that the Burmese people will join hands with the people in the world peace camp and move forward together!

    Defend world peace!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    缅甸人民为保卫世界和平而奋斗！
    缅甸保卫世界和平大会主席  德钦伦
    第二次世界大战结束，到今天仅仅六年时间，遭受了三年多战争灾祸的缅甸人民，直到今天战争创伤还未痊愈。但是，世界人民又重新遭受到严重的战争威胁，要想制止这一战争的威胁，只有我们和全世界人民团结在一起共同努力。
    美帝国主义者及其爪牙——为美元引诱收买的仆从国家——正在阴谋布置再一次挑起大战。美帝国主义所有的挑衅行为，并不是美国人民的意志。（这是美国人民已经表示过了的。）这种阴谋布置战争的行为，全世界人民难道能袖手旁观置之不理吗？不，绝对不，而且已经认识到如何团结保卫自己了。美帝国主义任意利用联合国作为侵略朝鲜，残害朝鲜人民的工具。爱好和平，厌恶战争的朝鲜人民，尽力地希望和平解决朝鲜问题，但由于美帝国主义破坏和平致使和谈毫无进展。
    不仅如此，美帝国主义者还无耻地侵占中国的领土台湾，不断侵犯中国的领海和领空，并且更进一步疯狂地公开武装德国纳粹分子和日本法西斯分子，释放战犯，利用对日和约的名义，蛮横地实行单独媾和。
    无论如何，过去在世界大战中，遭受到战争灾祸的人民已经了解到战争的危害，如果全世界人民想避免这个战争的话，必须团结起来，用人民的力量来反对美帝国主义所制造的侵略战争，那末，战争是能够制止的。
    对缅甸人民来说，在日本法西斯血腥统治下三年多的岁月里、不分男、女，老、小，遭受到拉民夫，打嘴巴、晒太阳、钳指甲、浇开水、活埋……等酷刑，记忆犹新。
    所以，缅甸人民不分种族、宗教、政治信仰、不分男女，为了一个共同目标——世界和平事业——工人、农民、学生、青年、妇女、作家、画家以及和尚们，都团结起来从各方面参加为和平而奋斗的事业。同样，国会议员中的人民代表们、市政委员们，不论在国会中或者在市政会议中，对斯德哥尔摩禁止原子弹的宣言以及世界和平理事会在柏林举行的第一届会议关于签订五大国和平公约的决议，绝对支持；对于停止侵略朝鲜战争，建议制止叫嚣战争的草案，时时刻刻都在努力。
    在这样反对和制止战争的奋斗中，狡猾的美帝国主义者，给予缅甸政府犹如有毒食物的“经济合作援助”，豢养为美帝国主义效忠的奴才。鼠目寸光的政府接受了这样“援助”以后，就继续进行反人民的措施。这是我们必须坚决反对和进行斗争的。
    美帝国主义借“经济援助”的美名，在全缅各地扩大和建筑飞机场，加紧修理主要海港并利用报纸、杂志、广播、电影等工具，肆无忌惮地宣传战争。美帝国主义还针对着反对帝国主义的先锋——在亚洲人民的导师毛泽东主席的领导下，向着世界和平目标突飞猛进的中华人民共和国——进行破坏。
    缅甸人民时时刻刻以反对和打击美帝国主义来担负起保卫世界和平的责任，并且相信：过去曾经，现在仍旧是，将来也一定更加坚决地站在保卫世界和平阵营这一方面而努力奋斗到底！我们坚信：人民的觉悟和人民的力量，一定可以制止一切破坏世界和平的行为，事实已经证明了这一点。
    我以缅甸保卫世界和平大会主席的身分宣誓：缅甸人民一定与世界和平阵营里的人民，共同携手前进！
    保卫世界和平！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
