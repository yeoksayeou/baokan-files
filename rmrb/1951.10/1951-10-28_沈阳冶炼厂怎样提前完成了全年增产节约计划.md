The Shenyang Smelting Plant completed 100.7% of its annual production increase and savings plan by the end of September, ahead of schedule, increasing production and saving the state wealth equivalent to 116,844 tons of grain. Why was the smelting plant able to complete its production increase and savings plan ahead of schedule? This is inseparable from the plant's serious efforts to formulate patriotic compacts for each workshop and team, which strongly promoted the plant's patriotic labor emulation campaign.

The patriotic compacts initially formulated by the smelting plant were handled by leading cadres and had little practical effect. When the production increase and savings campaign was launched in Shenyang, the plant's Party Committee organized workers to discuss how to discover and unleash potential production capacity and how to achieve production increase and savings. The workers signed collective contracts and launched challenge and competition campaigns at the workshop, team, and even individual levels. At this time, Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres discovered in their meetings that the key problem facing the leadership was the need for a political and organizational form to further guarantee the mass character of the collective contracts. At this point, everyone realized the importance of the patriotic compact and decided to organize the revision of the patriotic compact as an important link in organizing the production increase and savings campaign.

Although the leadership's understanding of the patriotic compact had changed, the workers still had various misconceptions about revising the patriotic compact. For example: "Why revise the compact after it's already been made?" "We can complete the task even without a compact." "Working eight hours is real, the rest (referring to revising the compact) is nonsense." The leadership analyzed and studied these ideological problems of the masses, selected propaganda materials, had reporters make reports, and had propagandists carry out propaganda in various forms to explain the great significance of the patriotic compact and its guarantee for production increase and savings. After repeated propaganda and education, the smelting plant began a production increase and savings campaign that combined labor emulation with the revision of the patriotic compact.

This time, when the cadres led the workers in revising the patriotic compact, they first overcame the past problem of taking over everything. When looking for the key to increasing production and saving, they guided the masses to extensively exchange opinions and held seminars and discussions to revise the patriotic compact consciously and voluntarily. The copper drum furnace in the smelting department, after in-depth research by the workers, found the technical shortcomings, explored the potential of the enterprise, and found a way to increase production and save money. For example, the task of the tuyere team was to ensure good furnace smelting and normal temperature. As a result of the workers' research, if they could do a good job in "three preventions" (preventing air leakage, preventing blackening of the tuyere, and preventing poor air supply), they could improve quality and reduce costs, and each person could increase production and save 64 tons of grain every half year. Therefore, the tuyere team made doing a good job in "three preventions" an important article of the team's patriotic compact. The leadership introduced and promoted the experience of the tuyere team in finding key problems and revising the compact in combination with production. In two weeks, more than 150 production teams throughout the plant generally revised their patriotic compacts. In this way, production increase and savings became a mass-based concrete plan and was fixed in the form of a patriotic compact. Similarly, the patriotic compact was also raised to a new level because it was combined with production, becoming a driving force for promoting the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses and ensuring the completion and surpassing of tasks.

The patriotic compact organized all the workers to carry out creative labor. For example, when copper furnace workers discussed revising the patriotic compact, Wu Kaiqian, an old technician from the tuyere team, suggested: the white, middle, and night shifts should be unified to avoid problems caused by each doing its own thing. He suggested that everyone should make a concrete plan to ensure the realization of the patriotic compact, write down what responsibilities they bear, and follow the plan. All the workers in the team accepted this suggestion, made plans, and did their best. For example, for workers with lower skills in the team, the team's requirements for them were sometimes too high in the past, making them feel unsure when working; this time, they made plans according to their abilities, and after everyone agreed, they followed the plans, and work efficiency was improved. Workers with higher skills reduced their odd jobs after making plans and focused on technical issues, which also improved work efficiency. Workers with higher skills in the front bed team made a personal plan to "do a good job in front bed insulation." They used needles to pick, replace new coke powder, and check the insulation situation when they came to work. The plan made by workers with lower skills was "not to lose a drop of copper matte," eliminating the phenomenon of losing 300 to 400 kilograms of copper matte every day in the past. The workers in the power department proposed in the compact to "save water, electricity, and oil, and strengthen power transmission." The time for cleaning the generator was shortened from 16 hours to 8 hours, extending the power transmission time. In this way, each department, each team, and each individual arranged the goals and specific methods of striving for production increase and savings in personal patriotic compacts and plans. Every worker in the plant knew their task of increasing production and saving, and knew where to increase production and where to save.

At the same time, the patriotic compact also promoted the unity of workers and technicians and further linked technical theory with production practice. For example, workers and technicians in the gold and silver electrolysis department were not united enough in the past. After the workers made a compact to "improve quality and complete the task of increasing production and saving," they held a meeting to study and found several technical problems that they could not solve themselves. Therefore, they reviewed the shortcomings of not seriously accepting technical leadership in the past and began to actively unite with technicians. Furnace burners and technicians gathered together to study the operation method of improving alloy quality, and the quality of the first furnace was improved by about 1%.

Under the promotion of the patriotic compact, the relationships in all aspects of the plant are now closer than before. In the past, some clerks in the plant never went to the site, but now financial clerks go down at least once a month to help the workers analyze cost reduction and also understand the situation on the site, improving their own business plans. In terms of technicians, they can now often go deep into the worker masses and provide technical guidance. Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leaders now each take two hours a week to talk to workers, understand the situation, and listen to the opinions of the masses, thereby improving leadership work.

In short, the patriotic compact enables everyone in the plant to use their brains to think of ways and add wealth to the country and reduce waste in a planned and purposeful manner. In this way, production potential is constantly being tapped, thus completing the annual production increase and savings plan ahead of schedule.

    沈阳冶炼厂怎样提前完成了全年增产节约计划
    中共沈阳市委宣传部宣传处
    沈阳冶炼厂于九月底提前完成了全年增产节约计划的百分之一百点七，给国家增产节约了等于十一万六千八百四十四吨粮食的财富。为什么冶炼厂能提前完成增产节约的计划呢？这是与该厂认真订好各车间、小组的爱国公约，因而有力地推动了全厂爱国主义劳动竞赛分不开的。
    冶炼厂最初订立的爱国公约，是由领导干部包办订立的，实际作用不大。当增产节约运动在沈阳开展起来的时候，该厂党委曾组织职工讨论如何发现与发挥生产上的潜在能力，如何实现增产节约。工人群众签订了集体合同，开展了车间、小组以至个人的挑战、竞赛。这时，党、政、工、团的干部会议上，发现了领导面临着的关键问题，是需要一种政治的与组织的形式，使集体合同进一步取得群众性的保证。这时大家意识到了爱国公约的重要意义，决定把组织修订爱国公约，作为组织增产节约运动的重要环节。
    领导上对爱国公约的认识虽然有了转变，但职工群众对修订爱国公约还有着种种错误的想法。比如：“公约订了，还修订干啥？”“不订公约也能完成任务。”“干八小时活是真的，别的（指修订公约）是瞎扯。”领导方面分析、研究了群众的这些思想问题，即选定宣传材料，由报告员作报告，由宣传员以各种形式进行宣传，说明爱国公约的伟大意义，说明修订爱国公约对增产节约的保证作用。经过反复的宣传教育，冶炼厂就开始了劳动竞赛与修订爱国公约相结合的增产节约运动。
    这一次，干部们在领导职工修订爱国公约时，首先克服了过去包办代替的毛病，在找增产节约关键时，引导群众广泛地交换意见，并举行座谈与讨论，自觉自愿修订爱国公约。熔炼部的铜鼓风炉，经过职工群众由浅入深的研究，从找出技术上的缺点，发掘企业潜力，摸到了增产节约的门径。例如风口小组的任务是保证炉内熔炼要好，温度正常。经职工研究的结果，如能作好“三防”工作（防止跑空气，防风口发黑，防送风不良），就能提高质量，降低成本，每人半年便能增产节约粮食六十四吨。于是风口小组就以做好“三防”作为小组爱国公约的重要条文。风口小组结合生产找出关键问题修订公约的经验，经领导方面介绍推广。在两个星期中，全厂一百五十多个生产小组，普遍修订了爱国公约。这样，增产节约便变成了群众性的具体计划，并以爱国公约的形式固定下来了。同样，爱国公约也因与生产结合而提高到了新的水平，成为了发扬群众爱国热情，保证完成与超过任务的推动力量。
    爱国公约把全体职工组织起来，进行了创造性的劳动。例如铜炉工人在讨论修订爱国公约时，风口组老技术工人吴凯谦提出：把白、中、夜三班要统一起来，免得各搞一套出毛病。他提议每个人都订出保证实现爱国公约的具体计划，负什么责任都写上，照着计划去作。全组职工接受了这一建议，都订了计划，做到了各尽所长。例如组内技术低的工友，过去组里对他们的要求有些过高，使他干活时感到没有把握；这次，他们按自己的能力订了计划，经大家同意后照着做，工作效率提高了。技术较高的工友，在订了计划之后，减少干零活，着重搞技术问题，也提高了工作效率。前床组内技术高的工友，他们订的个人计划“作好前床保温工作”，上班就用针子挑，换新焦粉，检查保温情况，技术较低的工人订的计划是“不丢一滴冰铜”，消灭了过去每天损失三百至四百公斤冰铜的现象。动力部职工在公约中提出“节省水、电、油，加强送电。”清扫发电机的时间从十六小时缩短到八小时，延长了送电时间。这样，每个部门、每个小组与个人，都把增产节约的奋斗目标与具体做法安排在个人爱国公约和计划里，全厂每个工人都知道自己增产节约的任务，知道应该从那里增产，从那里节约。
    同时，爱国公约也促进了工人与技术人员的团结，把技术理论与生产实际进一步联系起来了。如金银电解部工人与技术人员，过去不够团结。这次工友在公约上订了“提高质量，完成增产节约任务”以后，他们开会研究，发现了若干自己无法解决的技术问题，于是检讨了过去不认真接受技术领导的缺点，开始主动团结技术人员。烧炉工和技术员集合在一起，研究了提高合金质量的操作法，试验头一炉，便把质量提高了百分之一左右。
    在爱国公约的推动下，厂内各方面的关系都比以前密切了。过去该厂有些职员从来不下现场，现在财务职员每月最少下去一次，帮助工人群众进行降低成本的分析，自己也了解了现场情况，改善了本身的业务计划。在技术人员方面，现在已能做到经常深入工人群众，进行技术指导。党、政、工、团的领导干部，现在每周各抽出两小时同工人谈话，了解情况，听取群众意见，因而改进了领导工作。
    总之，爱国公约使全厂上下都在开动脑筋想办法，有计划有目的地为国家增添财富，减少浪费。这样，就使生产潜力不断被发掘出来，因而提前完成了全年的增产节约的计划。
