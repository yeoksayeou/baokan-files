The people of the whole country have been continuously sending letters, donations, and gifts for the past year to warmly greet and console the Chinese and Korean People's forces, demonstrating the boundless deep affection of hundreds of millions of people in our country for the Chinese and Korean People's armies, and their firm determination to resolutely support the Korean front.

According to statistics from the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, from January to early October this year, the committee has successively forwarded 1,159,716 letters and hundreds of telegrams of greetings from people across the country to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. While launching the campaign to donate airplanes and cannons to support the Korean front, the amount of donations, gifts, and comfort bags from people in various regions to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army has been increasing daily. According to statistics from the committee in September and October, the total amount of comfort donations remitted by people from various regions reached 158.77776 billion yuan, the number of comfort items donated by people from various regions to the Volunteers reached 1,932,268, and the number of comfort bags was 982,604. These figures demonstrate the determination and strength of the people of the whole country to support the Chinese and Korean People's armies.

Workers from various regions generally raised the slogan in their letters to the Volunteers: "Take the factory as the battlefield and the machines as weapons," resolutely guaranteeing that they will launch patriotic labor competitions to create a strong material force for the country to support the struggle against America. All the workers in the Zhao Guoyou lathe team of the Second Manufacturing Workshop of the Shenyang Third Machine Factory said in their letter to the Volunteers: "Comrades! You are fighting alongside the Korean People's Army on the front lines, and we guarantee to take the factory as the battlefield and the machines as weapons in the rear. We will supply whatever you need." Wei Ruhui, a female worker at the Beijing Clothing Factory, said in her letter: "All of our employees are actively producing day and night, resolutely guaranteeing that our comrades on the front lines will wear cotton clothes in time." The Liu Dezhen team of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant writes a letter to the Volunteers every month, reporting on the implementation of patriotic covenants and the creation of new production records. All the workers of the Changzhou Private Minfeng Yarn Factory said in their letter: "We must never be complacent with our existing achievements. As long as American imperialism does not abandon its plan of aggression, we will not relax our work to resist America and aid Korea."

Farmers from various regions generally proposed to support the struggle against America by working hard to produce, actively handing over public grain, and doing a good job in preferential treatment and cultivation for the families of soldiers. Han En and Wang Mingchen, agricultural labor models from Jilin Province, and 374 others, wrote letters thanking the Volunteers for protecting their stable and happy lives and reported in detail on the local situation of preferential treatment and cultivation. The letter said: "We often say, 'Don't forget the well-digger when drinking water.' We take care of your families like our own relatives." Mao Renqiu, a farmer from Xiangtan County, Hunan, the hometown of Chairman Mao, wrote a letter of greeting in the name of his entire family, saying: "This year, my family can increase production by at least fifty catties of rice per mu, and the crops of other farmers in the whole township are also growing very well. The people of the motherland have a strong force to support you." People of all ethnic minorities in Yunnan wrote letters to the Volunteers, saying: "We are your reserve team, your logistics department, and the assistance team for your families. Whatever you need, we will give you."

Industrial and commercial figures from various regions wrote letters to the Volunteers, guaranteeing that they would actively pay taxes, oppose speculation and profiteering, and oppose tax evasion to support the Volunteers. Educators guaranteed to stick to their posts and do their best for the people's education. Literary and art workers guaranteed to create literary and artistic works of various forms for the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Youth League members, students, and people standing on various work posts in the motherland wrote letters to the Volunteers, guaranteeing that they would intensify their studies, work hard, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Mothers and children also wrote letters thanking the Volunteers. A mother in Wuhu who had just given birth to a child said in her letter to the Volunteers: "Today, the peaceful and happy days of the mothers and children of New China are protected by you!" Gu Yiyong, an eight-year-old son of a worker at the Nanjing Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union, wrote a letter to the Volunteer commanders and fighters, saying: "Dear uncles, thank you for protecting me!"
