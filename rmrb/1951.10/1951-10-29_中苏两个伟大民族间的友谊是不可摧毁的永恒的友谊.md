The Friendship Between the Two Great Nations of China and the Soviet Union is an Indestructible and Eternal Friendship
    Suo Luoweiyefu, Head of the Soviet People's Observation Delegation
    Editor's Note: Suo Luoweiyefu, Head of the Soviet People's Observation Delegation and Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, who was invited to attend our National Day celebrations, returned to his country on the 20th of this month. Before returning to his country, he delivered a written speech at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station. The station broadcast his speech simultaneously with the Soviet Radio Station on the 26th. The translation of the speech is as follows:
    We will return to our motherland filled with rich and exciting impressions.
    First of all, I would like to talk about the soaring enthusiasm of all the people in your country. The entire Chinese people are inspired by deep patriotic enthusiasm, contributing all their strength, knowledge, and ability to build a new and happy life. At present, the Chinese people are like a giant, stretching out their strong arms, breaking free from foreign shackles, and standing firmly on the land of their motherland.
    We are convinced that the Chinese People's Government enjoys the greatest trust of all strata of the Chinese people. We are convinced that the Chinese people are loyal to their Communist Party and infinitely love their experienced and great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.
    We feel very honored to have come to China as the Soviet Observation Delegation during the joyful festival of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We feel very honored to have been able to shake hands with the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and to extend to him warm congratulations of friendship on behalf of all the Soviet people.
    The military parade and mass procession held in Tiananmen Square in Beijing on October 1st left us with unforgettable impressions. This was a review of the unity, strength, and youth of the great people. When tens of thousands of young pioneers appeared on the square behind the strong, modernized military cadets and well-trained troops of various arms, we, along with all the masses participating in the review, felt infinite joy for the happiness of hundreds of millions of Chinese children. Their childhood, their happiness, is reliably protected. They can develop and grow, they can study in peace. They know that their fathers and mothers, through heroic struggles, have won the freedom and independence of their motherland, and will never allow the feet of the enemy to step into the free land of their motherland again.
    We met with representatives of all strata of the Chinese people: farmers, workers, scholars, and artists. We met with young pioneers, young people, and old people, these old people who personally experienced all the horrors of life under the rule of foreign aggressors. We also talked with people of various professions. All these people, both adults and children, excitedly and enthusiastically told us about their studies, their work, and their future plans. They happily and proudly told us about the amazing achievements that the free Chinese people have made in the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    These achievements are indeed amazing. We personally witnessed this during our stay in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities and villages in China.
    We saw how the workers in the factories were struggling to over fulfill the production plan, and indeed over fulfilled the plan, dedicating more and more products to their people.
    We saw how the farmers, who have become the masters of their own land, are diligently cultivating the fields and obtaining a bumper harvest, while these lands used to belong to feudal landlords.
    We are convinced that science, literature, and art, which serve the people, have also made achievements and are providing the people with tremendous help in the construction of New Democratic China.
    Everywhere we saw the broad masses of working people very enthusiastic about culture, knowledge, and science. All these achievements made by the Chinese people in a short period of time undoubtedly prove the superiority of the New Democratic system, which has opened up the most far-reaching prospects for the rapid development and prosperity of the Chinese people.
    We feel deep joy that, no matter where we went, we felt the sincere and friendly love for our Soviet people and the great Stalin.
    The friendship between our two great nations is an indestructible and eternal friendship. The prosperity of our two great nations is linked together with this friendship. This friendship serves the cause of consolidating world peace.
    Before returning to our country, we express our sincere gratitude for the warm welcome and hospitality we received in your country.
    We warmly hope that the great Chinese people will achieve even greater achievements in the construction of New Democratic China.

    中苏两个伟大民族间的友谊是不可摧毁的永恒的友谊
    苏联人民观礼代表团团长  索洛维耶夫
    编者按：应邀参加我国国庆节的苏联人民观礼代表团团长、全苏工会中央理事会书记索洛维耶夫已经在本月二十日回国。他在回国以前曾应中央人民广播电台的邀请发表书面讲话。该台已于二十六日与苏联广播电台联播时同时播送了他的讲稿。讲词译文如下：
    我们将满载各种丰富的令人兴奋的观感返回自己的祖国。
    首先，我想讲一讲贵国全体人民蒸蒸日上的热情。全中国人民被深厚的爱国主义热情鼓舞着，为了建设新的幸福的生活贡献出自己的全部力量、全部知识和能力。目前中国人民好像一个巨人一样，伸开它的强有力的臂膀，挣脱了外国的羁绊，坚定地站立在自己祖国的土地上。
    我们确信：中国人民政府受到中国各阶层全体人民的最大的信任。我们确信：中国人民忠实于自己的共产党，并且无限地热爱自己的有经验的伟大领袖毛泽东同志。
    我们感到非常荣幸：因为在中华人民共和国成立二周年的欢乐的节日，我们作为苏联观礼代表团来到中国。我们感到非常荣幸：因为我们能够和中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志握手，并且代表全体苏联人民向他致以热烈的友谊的祝贺。
    十月一日在北京天安门广场举行的阅兵典礼和群众游行，给我们留下了不能忘记的印象。这是伟大人民的团结、力量和青春的检阅。在强有力的近代化军事学员和经过很好训练的各兵种部队后面，广场上出现了一万数千名少年儿童队员，这时候我们和所有参加检阅的群众一起，为千百万中国儿童的幸福感到无限的喜悦。他们的童年，他们的幸福，被可靠地保卫着。他们可以发育成长，他们可以安静地学习。他们知道：他们的父亲和母亲经过英勇的斗争获得了祖国的自由和独立，而决不允许敌人的脚再踏进他们祖国的自由的土地。
    我们会见了中国各阶层人民的代表：农民、工人、学者和艺术家。我们会见了少年儿童队员、青年人和老年人，这些老年人在外国侵略者统治时代亲身体验过一切恐怖的生活。我们还和各种职业的人们谈过话。所有的这些人们，无论大人和小孩，都兴奋热情地对我们讲述了他们的学习，他们的工作和他们将来的计划。他们愉快而骄傲地跟我们讲述了中华人民共和国成立两年以来，自由中国人民所获得的那些惊人的成就。
    这些成就的确是惊人的。我们在北京、上海和中国其他一些城市乡村停留的日子里，亲眼证实了这一点。
    我们看见：工厂中的工人们如何为超额完成生产计划而斗争，并且确实超额完成了计划，为自己的人民献出越来越多的生产品。
    我们看见：成了自己土地的主人的农民，怎样用心耕种着田地，获得了丰收，而这些土地过去是属于封建地主的。
    我们确信：为人民服务的科学、文学和艺术，同样获得了成就，并且在新民主主义中国的建设事业中给予人民以巨大的帮助。
    我们到处看见了广大劳动群众非常热心于文化、知识和科学的现象。中国人民在短期内获得的这一切成就，确切不移地证明新民主主义制度的优越性，这一制度为中国人民开辟了迅速发展和繁荣的最远大的前途。
    我们感到深深的喜悦，无论在什么地方，我们都感受到对我们苏联人民和伟大斯大林的真诚、友好的热爱。
    我们两个伟大民族间的友谊，是不可摧毁的永恒的友谊。我们两个伟大民族的繁荣和这种友谊联系在一起。这种友谊服务于巩固世界和平的事业。
    在我们回国以前，我们对于在贵国所受的热情的欢迎和款待表示真诚的谢意。
    我们热烈地希望伟大的中国人民，在新民主主义中国的建设事业中获得更大的成就。
