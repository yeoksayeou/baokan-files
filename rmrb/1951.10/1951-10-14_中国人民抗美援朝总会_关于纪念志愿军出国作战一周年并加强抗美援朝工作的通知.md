    Notice from the China Peace Committee
    Regarding Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Participation in the War and Strengthening the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea

    October 25th of this year marks the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight. In order to celebrate the great victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea over the past year, and in order to further strengthen the various tasks such as donating airplanes and cannons and promoting patriotic compacts, the local branches of this committee above the county and city level should contact the local people's representative conference consultative committees or the standing committees of the people's representative conferences, the democratic parties, the people's organizations, and representatives from all walks of life (including representatives of model patriotic compact groups, model patriotic production increase and thrift laborers, model anti-American and aid-Korea propagandists, and model families of volunteers and the People's Liberation Army) to convene a celebration meeting of hundreds or thousands of cadres and mass representatives on this day, and hold various lectures, symposiums, etc. The branches, sub-branches, and sub-sub-branches of this committee below the county and city level can decide whether to convene small representative gatherings according to the specific circumstances. Every grassroots unit that has established a patriotic compact should, on or around October 25th, use time outside of production, work, and study to hold gatherings to check the implementation of the patriotic compact (including production increase and donation plans) and future improvement methods. All newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and other propaganda and education institutions across the country should, on and around October 25th, carry out publicity on the victories and achievements of the anti-American and aid-Korea movement over the past year, on the current situation and the tasks of resisting America and aiding Korea. The content of the publicity should focus on opposing the United States' illegal unilateral peace treaty with Japan, its occupation of Japan, and its rearmament of Japan, opposing the United States' obstruction of the Korean negotiations, its continued aggression against Korea, and its occupation of our country's Taiwan, calling on the people of the whole country to continue to raise their hatred for American imperialism, eliminate all activities of American imperialism and its running dogs in China, calling on the people of the whole country to work hard to support the front, expand the movement to increase production and practice economy, complete the patriotic donation plan, popularize and deepen the patriotic compact movement, and strive for the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.

    Over the past year, all commanders and fighters of our Volunteer Army, in order to protect the security of the motherland and the free and happy lives of the people of the motherland, have fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, annihilated a large number of enemies, and achieved a great victory. Therefore, on the anniversary of the Volunteers going abroad to fight, the people of the whole country should express their respect and condolences to the Volunteers and their families and the families of martyrs. The provincial, municipal, and administrative region-level branches of this committee should represent the people of the whole country to comfort and express condolences to the wounded, sick, and disabled soldiers of the Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army in their respective provinces, cities, and regions.
