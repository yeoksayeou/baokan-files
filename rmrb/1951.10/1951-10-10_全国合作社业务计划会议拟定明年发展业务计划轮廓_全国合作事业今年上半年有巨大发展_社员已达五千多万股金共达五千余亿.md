Xinhua News Agency, 8th. To further integrate the cooperative movement with national economic construction and better meet the needs of the working people, the National Cooperatives Business Plan Conference, held recently in Beijing, outlined a plan for actively developing cooperative organizations and businesses in economic crop areas in the coming year. According to this plan, cooperatives will aim to meet more than 50% of the needs of their members for both consumer goods and means of production in 1952. Cooperatives in areas with a solid foundation are required to meet more than 60% of their members' needs. To achieve this plan, cooperatives in various regions will closely integrate with state-owned trade under a unified plan, expand the cooperative trade network, strengthen material exchanges between regions, develop handicraft production in a planned way, increase the variety of goods handled, accelerate capital turnover, reduce circulation costs, and strengthen economic accounting. The conference believes that the plan formulated at this meeting is only an outline, and therefore requires cooperatives at all levels to develop specific plans based on the outline formulated at this meeting and in conjunction with local actual conditions (the plans of grassroots cooperatives in various regions should be discussed and formulated at the members' representative meeting), report them level by level, and submit the plans of the general cooperatives of major administrative regions to the All-China Federation of Cooperatives before the end of the year, so that the plan formulated at this meeting is closer to reality and becomes an integral part of the entire national trade plan for 1952.

The conference discussed the operational issues of several major businesses based on the 1952 plan outline. Among them, the main issue was the fertilizer supply for next year. Since the amount of fertilizer supplied by cooperatives next year will be much larger than this year, the conference decided that the source of fertilizer should mainly be solved by the cooperatives themselves locally. The conference believes that the work of lending fertilizer and pre-purchasing has yielded great results this year, and this experience should be fully utilized next year to vigorously develop the business of selling on credit and pre-purchasing to ensure the completion of the purchase plan. The conference decided that fertilizer loans should be mainly targeted at the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary servicemen, and poor peasants. For wealthy peasants, the method of spot sales or ordering products should be adopted to expand the quantity of fertilizer operations.

The conference also discussed the current cotton purchase issue. The conference pointed out that the task of purchasing cotton by cooperatives this year is arduous. In order to complete this arduous task, the purchase of cotton by cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas must: 1. Be carried out under the leadership of the local CCP committees, people's governments, and cotton purchase committees, in cooperation with mass organizations and other relevant agencies; 2. Maintain control over prices and strictly abide by contract credit; 3. Do a good job in the supply of materials. The conference believes that among the materials currently needed by cotton farmers, handicrafts still account for a large proportion. Therefore, cooperatives at all levels cannot simply rely on the state to supply industrial products, but must plan to organize the exchange of handicrafts and make full use of local resources. This is the key to achieving material balance and price stability in cotton-producing areas after autumn. In order to cultivate grassroots cooperatives, the conference decided that the specific work of collecting cotton must be grasped by the grassroots cooperatives as much as possible, and the higher-level cooperatives should not directly purchase, but should provide specific help to the grassroots cooperatives.

The conference also discussed the division of labor in the operations of cooperatives at all levels, and formulated a draft plan for the operating methods of cooperatives at all levels.

Finally, representatives of cooperatives from various regions signed a large number of material exchange contracts and agreements at the meeting, which will be implemented this winter and next spring, with a total value of 24,343 billion yuan.

This conference began in Beijing on August 27 and ended on September 14.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The national cooperative movement has achieved great development in the first half of this year. According to statistics at the end of June, the number of members in various grassroots cooperatives (mainly rural supply and marketing cooperatives and urban consumer cooperatives) nationwide has reached 50.075 million, an increase of 20.48 million compared with the end of 1950. The share capital of grassroots cooperatives nationwide is more than 530 billion yuan, an increase of more than 160 billion yuan compared with the end of 1950. The business of cooperatives nationwide has also developed rapidly in the first half of the year. According to incomplete statistics, the total retail sales of cooperatives in the Northeast region in the first half of the year was more than 2 trillion yuan, equivalent to 62% of the total retail sales for the whole of last year; the purchase amount was more than 1.1 trillion yuan, equivalent to 69% of the total purchase amount for the whole of last year. The retail sales of cooperatives in the North China region in the first half of this year were 2.1 trillion yuan, equal to 70% of the total retail sales for the whole of last year; the purchase amount in the first half of the year reached 2 trillion yuan, exceeding the total purchase amount for the whole of last year by more than 3%. This year, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives accepted the state's fertilizer loan task and supplied fertilizers to farmers on a large scale in an organized and planned manner for the first time. Through the work of lending fertilizer and pre-purchasing, the total amount of cotton pre-purchased by cooperatives in the four major administrative regions of North China, East China, Northwest China, and Central South China this year reached more than 4.9 million dan. With the addition of cotton that may be purchased after autumn and collected on behalf of the state, the total amount of cotton collected by cooperatives this year may reach more than half of the commercial cotton.

Due to the implementation of the policy of serving the members, cooperatives in various regions have achieved the goal of serving without seeking profit in their business operations in the first half of the year; and implemented a democratic system in their organization, which has improved the understanding of cooperatives by the vast number of members, thus making them increasingly concerned about and cherish their own cooperatives. The supply and marketing cooperative of Datuan District, Nanhui County, pre-purchased 95% of the total output of cotton in the entire district this year. Before the new cotton was put on the market, all the member representatives unanimously decided to guarantee that all the cotton produced would be sold to the state. This shows that cooperatives have also played a significant role in strengthening the political education of patriotism among farmers.

    全国合作社业务计划会议拟定明年发展业务计划轮廓
    全国合作事业今年上半年有巨大发展
    社员已达五千多万股金共达五千余亿
    【新华社八日讯】为了使合作社事业进一步与国家经济建设相结合，并更多地满足劳动人民的需要，不久前在北京举行的全国合作社业务计划会议拟订了明年度以经济作物地区为重点积极发展合作社的组织与业务的计划轮廓。根据这个计划轮廓，一九五二年内合作社在生活资料和生产资料的供应上要做到满足社员需要的百分之五十以上；工作基础较好的地区的合作社要求做到满足社员需要的百分之六十以上。为了实现这一计划，各地合作社将在统
    一计划之下与国营贸易密切结合，扩大合作社贸易网，加强各地物资交流，有计划地发展手工业生产，增加经营商品的种类，加速资金周转，减少流转费用，加强经济核算。会议认为，这次会议制订的计划仅是一个轮廓，因此要求各级合作社根据这次会议所制订的计划轮廓，结合当地实际情况制订具体计划（各地基层合作社的计划应在社员代表会议上讨论和制定），逐级上报，各大行政区合作总社的计划在年底前送交全国合作总社，以便使这次会议制订的计划更接近于实际，并成为一九五二年整个国家贸易计划的一个组成部分。
    会议根据一九五二年计划轮廓讨论了几种主要业务的经营问题。其中主要是明年的肥料供应问题。由于明年合作社供应肥料的数量比今年大得多，会议决定，肥料的来源主要应由各地合作社自己就地设法解决。会议认为：今年贷肥和预购工作收获很大，明年应充分运用这一经验，大量开展赊销预购业务，以保证收购计划的完成。会议决定，贷肥应以革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和贫困农民为主要对象，对于富裕农民应采取现售或订购产品方式，以扩大肥料经营数量。
    会议还讨论了目前的棉花收购问题。会议指出，今年合作社收购棉花任务是繁重的。为了完成这个繁重的任务，各地合作社收购棉花必须：一、在各产棉区中共党委、人民政府、收棉委员会领导之下，与群众团体及其他有关机关配合进行；二、必须掌握价格，严守合同信用；三、要做好物资供应工作。会议认为，目前棉农需要的物资中，手工业品还占很大比重，因此各级合作社不能单纯依靠国家供给工业品，必须有计划地去组织手工业品交流，充分利用地方资源。这是产棉区秋后做到物资平衡、物价平稳的关键。为了培养基层合作社，会议决定收棉的具体工作必须尽可能由基层社掌握，上级社不要直接去收购，但应给基层社以具体帮助。
    会议也讨论了各级合作社经营上的分工问题，并拟定了一个各级合作社经营办法的草案。
    最后各地合作社代表在会上签订了大批将在今冬明春执行的物资交换合同和协议，其总值达两万四千三百四十三亿元。
    这次会议八月二十七日开始在北京举行，九月十四日结束。
    【新华社八日讯】全国合作事业今年上半年又有巨大的发展。据六月底统计，全国各种基层合作社
    （主要是农村供销合作社和城市消费合作社）社员数已达到五千零七十五万人，比一九五零年底增加两千零四十八万人。全国基层合作社股金为五千三百余亿元，比一九五零年底增加一千六百多亿元。上半年全国合作社业务也有迅速的发展。据不完全统计，东北区合作社上半年零售总额在二万亿元以上，相当于去年全年零售额的百分之六十二；收购额为一万一千多亿元，相当于去年全年收购额的百分之六十九。华北区合作社今年上半年零售额为二万一千亿元，等于去年全年零售额的百分之七十；上半年收购额达到二万亿元，已超过去年全年收购额百分之三以上。今年全国合作总社接受国家肥贷任务，第一次有组织有计划大规模地供应农民肥料。通过肥贷和预购工作，今年华北、华东、西北、中南四个大行政区合作社预购棉花总量达四百九十余万担，加上秋后可能收购的和代国家征收的棉花，今年合作社收棉总量可能达到商品棉的一半以上。
    由于贯彻了为社员服务的方针，上半年各地合作社在业务上做到了以服务为目的而不以营利为目的；在组织上实行了民主制度，这就提高了广大社员对合作社的认识，因而使他们日益关心和爱护自己的合作社。南汇县大团区供销合作社今年预购的棉花占全区产量的百分之九十五，新花上市前全体社员代表又一致决议保证把所产棉花全部卖给国家。这说明合作社在加强农民爱国主义的政治教育上也发挥了显著的作用。
