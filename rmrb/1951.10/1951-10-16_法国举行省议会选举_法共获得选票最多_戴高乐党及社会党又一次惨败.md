    Xinhua News Agency, Paris: On October 7th, France held provincial council elections. The voting results show that the French democratic forces, led by the Communist Party, have achieved another major victory, while the reactionary forces, especially the American darling, fascist leader De Gaulle's Rally of the French People, and the Socialist Party, which betrayed the working class, have suffered another heavy defeat.
    According to the final vote count announced by the French Ministry of the Interior, the Communist Party received a total of 1,524,443 votes, far exceeding all the reactionary parties. The Socialist Party received only 1,100,780 votes, and the fascist Rally of the French People received only 846,992 votes. This election shows that the strength of the Communist Party is growing stronger and stronger: in 1945, the Communist Party received 22.7 percent of all votes, in 1948 it increased to 23.5 percent, and now it has increased to 23.8 percent. As for the Socialist Party and the Rally of the French People, they are increasingly despised by the people: in 1945, the Socialist Party received 24.7 percent of all votes, in 1948 it dropped to 19.4 percent, and now it has dropped to 17.2 percent; the Rally of the French People even plummeted from 25.3 percent of the total votes in 1948 to the current 13.4 percent. In addition, in the entire election, as many as 40 percent of voters refused to vote in order to express their dissatisfaction with the ruling parties.
    Like the French general election on June 17th, this election also exposed the true face of the bourgeois "democratic" system. The size of the electoral districts in the French provincial council elections varies extremely widely. Some industrialized electoral districts with more than 100,000 voters and rural electoral districts with only a thousand voters equally elect one provincial councilor. This allows reactionary parties with few votes, such as the Independent Republican Peasant Union, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Socialist Party, to seize hundreds of seats in the July 7th election, while the Communist Party, which is supported by the broadest masses, only received thirty-six seats. In addition, this election adopted the anti-democratic "two-round majority representation system." According to this system, in the 700 electoral districts where no party candidate received a majority of the votes in the July 7th election, a second round of voting will be held on the 14th. At this time, the candidate can be elected as long as they obtain a relative majority. This system is conducive to collusion among the reactionary parties.
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a declaration on the evening of the 7th, pointing out that the results of the 7th voting were a major victory for the parties striving for peace and national independence, and announced that it was willing to form a broad united front with all candidates who are willing to defend peace, freedom, national independence, and the living rights of the working people when the second round of voting is held on the 14th, so as to block the path of the warmongers.

    法国举行省议会选举
    法共获得选票最多
    戴高乐党及社会党又一次惨败
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：巴黎消息：十月七日，法国举行省议会选举。投票结果表明：以共产党为首的法国民主力量获得了又一次的重大胜利，而反动力量，首先是美国宠儿、法西斯头子戴高乐的法兰西人民联盟和出卖工人阶级的社会党，却遭到了又一次惨重的失败。
    据法国内政部公布开票的最后结果，共产党共得一百五十二万四千四百四十三张选票，远超过各反动党派之上；社会党只得一百一十万零七百八十票，法西斯的法兰西人民联盟只得八十四万六千九百九十二票。这次选举表明共产党的力量是越来越壮大了：一九四五年共产党得到全部选票的百分之二十二点七，一九四八年增至百分之二十三点五，而现在又增至百分之二十三点八。至于社会党和法兰西人民联盟，却越来越被人民唾弃：一九四五年社会党得到全部选票的百分之二十四点七，一九四八年降至百分之十九点四，现在又降至百分之十七点二；法兰西人民联盟更从一九四八年得票占总票数百分之二十五点三猛降到现在的百分之十三点四。此外，在整个选举中，竟有百分之四十的选民为了不满各执政党而拒绝投票。
    和六月十七日法国大选一样，这次选举也暴露了资产阶级“民主”制度的真面目。法国省议会选举的选区大小极其悬殊，选民达十万人以上的一些工业发达的选区和选民只有千把人的农村选区都同样地选出一个省议员来。这就使得独立共和农民联盟、激进社会党、社会党等得票不多的反动党派在七日选举中夺到了好几百个议席，而受到最广大群众拥护的共产党却只得到三十六个议席。此外，这次选举采取的是反民主的“二次投票多数代表制”。按照这个制度，在七日选举中各党派候选人没有得到过半数选票的七百个选区，要在十四日举行第二次投票。这时，候选人只要获得相对多数，就可以当选。这个制度有利于各反动党派进行勾结。
    法国共产党中央委员会在七日晚发表宣言，指出七日投票的结果是争取和平与民族独立的政党的重大胜利，并宣布它愿意在十四日举行第二次投票时和一切愿保卫和平、自由、民族独立和劳动人民生活权利的候选人结成广泛的统一阵线，这样来堵住战争贩子的道路。
