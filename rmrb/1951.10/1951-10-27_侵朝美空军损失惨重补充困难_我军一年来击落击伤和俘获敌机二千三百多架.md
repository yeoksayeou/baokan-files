Xinhua News Agency, 26th Dispatch: The massive losses of American aggressor aircraft on the Korean battlefield have made it impossible for the American aggressors to replenish them in time. According to a United Press report from Washington on the 22nd, "The loss of American combat aircraft now exceeds its ability to replenish them. The reduction in flights in Europe and the reduction in bombing activities in Korea, along with the planned transfer of domestic air force jet aircraft… all clearly demonstrate this."

The U.S. Department of Defense has been covering up the heavy losses suffered by the U.S. Air Force on the Korean battlefield. However, some uncensored dispatches from the American authorities still reveal some true situations. A United Press dispatch on September 2nd said: "In a review of aerial activities, the Navy Department said that few aircraft from the Fourteenth Air Wing of the light aircraft carrier 'Glory' were not damaged by anti-aircraft fire." In fact, this is true not only for naval aircraft, but also for aircraft under the Air Force Department. On May 2nd of this year, the Associated Press revealed the heavy blows suffered by the Fifth Air Force, saying: "When you walk past a row of fighter planes, you can't find one that doesn't have patched bullet holes or anti-aircraft shrapnel marks." "Don't think that air combat is going out for a picnic, doing routine flights, no, it is a cruel thing, as cruel as death."

A jet pilot quoted by an Associated Press reporter completely exposed the American authorities' concealment of American aircraft losses. He said: "The American public must still think that we are just doing routine flights. This idea is indeed good, if their imagination is that the planes fly out like arrows, attack the enemy, and then return safely. But staying over a heavily guarded target for fifteen minutes is enough to make you see things, some comrades cannot come back to tell you what happened. Everything I heard on the radio and saw in the newspaper seems to suggest that we haven't lost any planes at all."

The Associated Press reporter continued: "In a major air battle in northern Korea not long ago, two B-29 bombers were shot down, and three others barely managed to stagger back to the Allied base to make crash landings. If you think that the Communist radar-controlled anti-aircraft guns fire day and night and hit nothing, then you are a fool. Their anti-aircraft guns do hit things." "Four jet planes went to North Korea to carry out an intense bombing mission, and encountered dense anti-aircraft fire on the way back. One pilot later said: 'The sky was filled with smoke, we had to fly through the fire, there was fire all around us, there was simply no way to get out. Suddenly our captain's plane slowly swayed left and right, and then plunged vertically. We called him on the radio, until his plane crashed to the ground, he did not answer us.'"

The long-term huge losses of the aggressor air force are what the U.S. Department of Defense dares not announce. A United Press dispatch from Washington on the 22nd admitted: "The figures of American Air Force aircraft destroyed and damaged in Korea have never been fully disclosed."

However, it is known that the American aggressor air force has had 2,310 aircraft shot down, damaged, and captured in the eleven and a half months since the Chinese People's Volunteers entered the war. That is an average loss of 6.6 aircraft per day. This huge loss is something that the American aggressors cannot make up for in time. A United Press dispatch from Washington on the 22nd revealed the difficult situation of American aircraft production, saying: According to the recent report by Wilson, Director of the Defense Mobilization Agency, "The United States has reached a monthly production of 450 aircraft of various types for the three armed forces. ... But in terms of the conventional aircraft load-bearing standard, American production is only slightly more than the peak in 1950. This fact, combined with Wilson's report, proves that many trainers and other light aircraft must also be counted in the 450 aircraft. The current situation shows that there is still a large gap between the time of appropriation and the time of manufacturing combat aircraft. For fighter planes, there is a gap of about twenty months, and for bombers, it is even longer. When the Air Force was established in September last year, funds were allocated to manufacture aircraft, and the first aircraft has not yet been delivered."

### 侵朝美空军损失惨重补充困难  我军一年来击落击伤和俘获敌机二千三百多架

    侵朝美空军损失惨重补充困难
    我军一年来击落击伤和俘获敌机二千三百多架
    【新华社二十六日讯】朝鲜战场上美国侵略军飞机的大量损失，已使美国侵略者来不及补充。据合众社华盛顿二十二日电称：“现在美国作战飞机的损失比它能够补充的要多。在欧洲飞行的减少，和在朝鲜轰炸活动的减少，与计划中的把国内航空部队的喷气机转移……，这一切都明显地证明了这一点。”
    美国国防部一直在掩盖着美国空军在朝鲜战场上的惨重损失。但是，一些经过美国当局检查的电讯仍然透露了一些真实的情况。合众社九月二日的电讯说：“海军部在综述空中活动时说：轻型航空母舰‘光荣号’上的第十四航空母舰空军大队的飞机很少不被高射炮击伤的。”其实不仅海军飞机，空军部所辖的飞机也是如此。今年五月二日美联社透露了第五航空队遭受重大打击的情况时说：“当你走过一排战斗机的时候，你找不到有一架上面没有补过的枪洞或高射炮眼的飞机。”“不要以为空军作战是出去郊游，作例行飞行，不是的，这是残酷的事情，像死一样残酷。”
    美联社记者引一个喷气机驾驶员的话，完全暴露了美国当局隐瞒美机的损失。他说：“美国的公众一定还以为我们只是作例行的飞行呢。这种想法确也不错，如果他们的想像中飞机是箭一样地飞出去，袭击敌人，接着就安然归来的话。不过在保护严密的目标上空呆上十五分钟，就够你瞧的了，有些同伴已经不能回来把经历的情形告诉你了。我从无线电里听到的和从报上看到的一切，好像我们就没有损失过飞机似的。”
    美联社记者接着说：“在不久前朝鲜北部的一场大空战中，两架B——29轰炸机被击落，另外三架好不容易摇摇摆摆飞回联军基地进行毁机着陆。如果你以为共产党雷达控制的高射炮日夜轰击，什么也打不着，那你就是傻瓜。他们的高射炮是打中了东西的。”“四架喷气机往北朝鲜去执行了一次紧张的轰炸任务，在返防的途中遇到密集的高射炮火。一个驾驶员后来说：‘满天被打得乌烟瘴气，我们得穿过炮火飞，四周围都是炮火，简直没有缝钻出去。突然我们队长的飞机慢慢地左摇右摆，然后垂直下坠。我们在无线电上喊他，一直喊到他的飞机坠毁在地上，他没有回答我们。’”
    侵略者空军长时期以来的巨大损失，是美国国防部不敢公布的。合众社华盛顿二十二日电承认：“美国空军在朝鲜遭到击毁和击伤的数字从来没有完全地透露过。”
    但是，人们知道，美国侵略空军在中国人民志愿军参战以来的十一个半月被击落击伤和被俘飞机二千三百一十架。也就是每天平均损失六·六架。这一巨大损失是美国侵略者来不及弥补的。合众社华盛顿二十二日电透露了美国目前飞机生产的困难情形，消息说：根据国防动员署署长威尔生在最近的报告中暗示“美国已达到每月生产各式飞机四百五十架供三军之用。……但用习惯的飞机载重的衡量标准来说美国的生产仅比一九五○年最高峰稍多一些而已。这个事实与威尔生的报告结合起来看，证明有许多教练机和其它轻型飞机一定也算在四百五十架内。现在的情况说明了在拨款时间与造出作战飞机的时间之间还有着很大的距离。对战斗机而言，约有二十个月的距离，轰炸机则更久。去年九月建立空军力量时曾拨款制造飞机，到现在第一架飞机还没有交货。”
