    Chairman Mao:

    On the occasion of the motherland's National Day, we, the students in the UK, express our highest enthusiasm and pay our utmost respect and congratulations to you and the people of the motherland. Under your correct leadership, the people of the motherland have thoroughly overthrown the reactionary regime of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and launched an unprecedented great construction undertaking. Currently, the three major movements are being vigorously implemented. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers are giving the invaders a merciless blow in order to defend human justice and world peace. In addition to expressing our heartfelt gratitude and support, we are determined to return to the country immediately after completing our studies to participate in the great cause of New Democracy, and dedicate ourselves under your banner to building the people's motherland and defending world peace. Finally, we respectfully wish you good health! And long live the People's Republic of China!
