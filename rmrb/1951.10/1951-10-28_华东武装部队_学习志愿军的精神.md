Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 24th: "Learning the patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, learning the Volunteer Army's spirit of bravely and stubbornly fighting the enemy and their combat experience" has become a resounding slogan and action in the Eastern China Armed Forces.

　　Whether performing any task, commanders and fighters always keep in mind to use the glorious actions of the Volunteer Army to inspire themselves. The Fujian bandit suppression troops encircled and suppressed bandits in the continuous mountains, often eating wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger, camping in the wilderness, and marching one hundred and several tens of *li* in one night. In this difficult situation, they encouraged each other: "We must learn the Volunteer Army's spirit of arduous combat and not come down the mountain until the bandits are wiped out!"

　　The soldiers' knapsacks and pockets are filled with communication collections recording the heroic battles of the Volunteer Army. Whenever there is a gap, they sit around and carefully study communications such as "Yang Gensi Heroic Platoon," "Guo Zhongtian Heroic Platoon," "Lone Daredevil Hero Lü Songshan," and "Who is the Most Lovable Person." The heroic deeds in these communications have been memorized by thousands of cadres and fighters. The heroic figures in the communications have become role models for commanders and fighters to admire and learn from wholeheartedly.

　　A certain coastal defense unit launched a movement to "Learn from Guo Zhongtian Heroic Platoon." Commanders and combatants have universally launched heated discussions. They unanimously expressed that they would learn Guo Zhongtian Platoon's high degree of patriotism and internationalism, actively study tactics and techniques, and adopt the heroic and resourceful fighting style of defeating the American invading army, which possessed superior equipment, with inferior equipment.

　　Commanders and fighters often write letters to comfort the Volunteer Army and send their favorite picture albums and notebooks to the Volunteer Army. In every letter, they enthusiastically express their determination to defend the motherland and defend peace.

    华东武装部队
    学习志愿军的精神
    【新华社南京二十四日电】“学习志愿军的爱国主义和国际主义精神，学习志愿军打击敌人的英勇顽强精神和作战经验”，已成为华东武装部队中响亮的口号和行动。
    无论在执行什么任务时，指战员们总念念不忘以志愿军的光辉行动来激励自己。福建剿匪部队在连绵的大山中围剿土匪，经常吃野菜充饥，在荒山中露营，一夜奔袭一百数十里。在这种艰苦的情况下，他们就互相鼓励：“我们要学习志愿军艰苦作战的精神，不剿灭土匪不下山！”
    战士们的挂包里、口袋里装着记述志愿军英勇作战的通讯集，一有空隙，就围坐起来精读“杨根思英雄排”、“郭忠田英雄排”、“独胆英雄吕松山”、“谁是最可爱的人”等通讯。这些通讯中的英雄事迹，已为千万个干部和战士们熟记。通讯中的英雄人物，已成为指战员们衷心仰慕和学习的榜样。
    某海防部队展开了“学习郭忠田英雄排”的运动。指挥员、战斗员们普遍展开了热烈的讨论。他们一致表示要学习郭忠田排的高度爱国主义和国际主义精神，积极地钻研战术技术，以劣势装备战胜了占有优势装备的美国侵略军的英勇机智的战斗作风。
    指战员们经常写信慰问志愿军，并把自己最心爱的画报、笔记本送给志愿军。他们在每封信里都热烈地表示自己保卫祖国和保卫和平的决心。
