    Implement a Document Inspection and Follow-up System

    Reader He Zhi writes: Recently, some government agencies and enterprises in Beijing have begun to implement a document inspection and follow-up system. The earnest implementation of this system will play a significant role in overcoming the bureaucratic and dilatory work style in these government agencies and enterprises.

    Our government agencies and enterprises serve the people. Cadres in government agencies and enterprises should handle their work with a responsible attitude and the most efficient methods. We must not allow the perfunctory, dilatory and outdated work style to continue to exist, so as not to affect the prestige of revolutionary organs and people's enterprises and directly harm the interests of the people. But in fact, there are still many cadres in government agencies and enterprises who still seriously harbor this bad work style. They have not dealt with matters that should be handled in their own positions; or they have delayed them all the time without dealing with them in a timely manner; they let documents travel back and forth between departments for a long time; they let cases lie sleeping in the drawers of their desks; they think that everything will be fine once a circular is issued and a document is filed. This bad phenomenon needs to be overcome by various methods. The document inspection and follow-up system is a good remedy for this paralysis, a sharp weapon to attack this bureaucratic work style, and also a link to strengthen the connection between revolutionary organs and people's enterprises and the masses of the people. It is hoped that government agencies and enterprises in various places will implement this system to thoroughly overcome the bureaucratic and dilatory work style in government agencies and enterprises.

### 实行公文检查和催办制度

    实行公文检查和催办制度
    读者何智来信反映：最近北京有些机关企业已经开始实行公文检查和催办制度。这种制度的认真执行，对于克服这些机关企业中的官僚主义的拖沓作风将起着重大的作用。
    我们的机关企业，是替人民办事的。机关企业的干部应该用切实负责的态度和最有效率的方法来办理自己的工作，绝不能让马马虎虎，拖拖沓沓的陈腐作风继续存在下去，以致影响革命机关和人民企业的威信和直接损害人民的利益。但事实上，却有不少机关企业的干部，仍然严重地存在着这样的坏作风，他们对于本身职务应办的事情，并没有去办；或者一直延搁下来，没有及时去办；他们让文件在各部门间传来传去，作长期旅行；他们让案件躺在办公棹的抽屉里睡觉；他们以为通令一发出，文稿一归档，就会万事大吉。这种恶劣现象，是需要用各种方法去克服的。公文检查和催办制度，是医治这种瘫痪病症的一种良方，是攻击这种官僚主义作风的尖锐武器，同时也是加强革命机关和人民企业与人民群众联系的一个纽带。希望各地机关企业，都要实行这种制度，来彻底克服机关企业中的官僚主义的拖沓作风。
