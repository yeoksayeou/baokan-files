Brief Commentary on Party Life

    机关 propaganda workers should be universally established
    机关 propaganda worker organizations are an important component of the Party's entire propaganda worker organization. The number of Communist Party members in government and Party organs at all levels accounts for a large proportion of all Party members, and these Party members are mostly the backbone of the Party. Making these Party members serve as Party propaganda workers is obviously of great importance to strengthening the Party's propaganda work. Therefore, Party committees at all levels should attach importance to establishing 机关 propaganda worker work.
    Local experiences have proven that wherever 机关 propaganda workers have been established, significant results have been achieved in strengthening local mass propaganda work. They have also played a significant role in close integration of the Party with the masses and enlivening the political life of 机关. Internal propaganda and education work within 机关, such as political classes, blackboards, and reading groups, has also been consistently maintained due to the active efforts of propaganda workers.
    However, not all Party members and cadres have clearly understood the significance and role of establishing 机关 propaganda workers. On the contrary, there are still many comrades who have incorrect understandings or concerns about this work. Therefore, to this day, many 机关 have not established propaganda worker organizations. Therefore, in these places, it is necessary to educate these comrades to understand the importance of establishing propaganda worker organizations, and to make them understand that carrying out propaganda work among the masses to strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses is the duty of every Party member, and 机关 Party members are no exception. The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People" has clearly stipulated that "propaganda workers should be set up in every Party branch." 机关 Party organizations should, of course, strictly implement this provision.
    Generally speaking, the tasks of 机关 propaganda workers should be two: one is to carry out propaganda to local residents, and the other is to carry out propaganda within 机关. Propaganda workers can be divided into those who are specifically responsible for internal propaganda within 机关, and those who are specifically responsible for propaganda to local residents. In some 机关 with a large number of non-Party masses and poor political education (such as some economic and trade departments), propaganda workers should first do a good job of internal political propaganda within 机关. Otherwise, it will be difficult to carry out external propaganda. When there are fewer internal propaganda tasks, propaganda workers should use more effort to work with residents.
    When 机关 propaganda workers carry out residential work, they should work through local Party organizations at all levels and under the unified leadership of the local Party committee. Generally speaking, the local Party committee (such as the district committee, etc.) should uniformly divide the work areas of each 机关 branch, and the list of propaganda workers of the 机关 branch should be handed over to the resident district committee, which will assign work tasks to them. When necessary, the district committee may invite the负责人 of the 机关 branch to jointly study the work of propaganda workers together with the public security police station. 机关 branches should also take the initiative to care for and help local Party organizations improve the work of propaganda workers, and should pay attention to helping cultivate activists in local propaganda work in order to strengthen local propaganda worker organizations.
    The propaganda of 机关 propaganda workers to residents should be done as far as possible with fixed targets and fixed areas. Some propaganda workers should be assigned to help local propaganda workers to lead regular propaganda and education organizations such as blackboards, civil schools, and reading groups, and some propaganda workers should be fixed to residential areas and resident groups. This division of labor is clear, which is convenient for understanding the situation, carrying out systematic propaganda, and facilitating contact with the masses and cultivating the enthusiasm of the masses.

    党的生活简评
    应该普遍建立机关宣传员
    机关宣传员组织，是党的整个宣传员组织的一个重要组成部分。政府和党的各级机关中的共产党员的数目，占了全党党员的很大比重，而且这些党员大都是党的骨干分子，使这些党员充当党的宣传员，这对于加强党的宣传员工作，显然有极大重要性。因此，各级党委都应重视建立机关宣传员的工作。
    各地经验证明：凡已建立了机关宣传员的地方，对于加强地方群众宣传工作，都收到了显著的效果。对密切党和群众的联系上，对活跃本机关的政治生活上，也都起了很大的作用。机关内部的政治课、黑板报、读报组等项宣传教育工作，也因宣传员的积极努力而经常坚持下来。
    但并不是所有党员和干部都已经对建立机关宣传员的意义和作用认识清楚了。相反的，现在还有许多同志对这一工作存在着不正确的认识或顾虑。所以一直到现在，还有很多机关没有建立宣传员的组织。因此，在这些地方，就必须教育这些同志明了建立宣传员组织的重要性，使他们明白向群众进行宣传工作，以加强党和群众的联系，这是每个党员的义务，机关党员也不能例外。中共中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”已经明确规定要“在党的每个支部设立宣传员”。机关党的组织，当然也应严格执行这一条规定。
    一般说，机关宣传员的任务应该是两个：一是向驻地居民进行宣传，一是在机关内部进行宣传。宣传员可进行分工，有的可专门负责机关内部的宣传，有的可专门负责驻地群众的宣传。在某些非党群众较多政治教育又差的机关（如有些经济、贸易部门），宣传员就应该首先把机关内部的政治宣传工作作好，不这样，就很难进行对外宣传。在内部宣传任务较少的情况下，宣传员就应该以更多的力量来向居民进行工作。
    机关宣传员进行居民工作时，应该通过各级地方党的组织，并在当地党委统一领导下进行工作。一般说，驻地党委（如区委等）应统一划分各机关支部的工作地区，机关支部的宣传员名单应交给驻地区委，并由他们分配工作任务。必要时，区委可邀请机关支部的负责人会同公安派出所等共同研究宣传员工作。机关支部也应主动关心与帮助地方党组织改进宣传员工作，应注意帮助培养当地宣传工作的积极分子，以便加强当地宣传员组织。
    机关宣传员对居民的宣传，要尽量作到固定对象固定地区。一部分宣传员应分工帮助地方宣传员去领导黑板报、民校、读报组等经常性的宣传教育组织，一部分宣传员应固定到居民区和居民小组。这样分工明确，既便于了解情况，进行有系统的宣传，又便于联系群众和培养群众的积极分子。
