Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 8th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on October 7th: On October 6th, Grotewohl, the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a speech at the celebration of the second National Day of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin. He pointed out that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic laid the foundation for the establishment of a new, independent, and free Germany. This historically significant day is the starting point for the German people to move towards national unity, prosperity, and lasting peace. In the two years since its establishment, the German Democratic Republic has united all the democratic and peace-loving forces of Germany around it, and it has become the most solid base for the German people to launch a national struggle for unity and peace.

Grotewohl then described the achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in various aspects such as economy, politics, and culture in the past two years. He said that in the German Democratic Republic, unemployment has become a thing of the past, the volume of trade in goods has increased, and the currency value has been consolidated. Since West Germany implemented currency reform in 1948, West Germany's currency has increased from 4.2 billion marks to 9.1 billion marks, while the currency of the German Democratic Republic remains at 3.2 billion marks. The purchasing power of the German Democratic Republic mark has been continuously improved due to the increase in labor productivity and the reduction of prices.

In his speech, Grotewohl emphasized the importance of expanding and consolidating trade relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and the People's Republic of China. He said that the enormous potential for development of trade with these countries can guarantee that all enterprises and every able-bodied German in a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany will have enough work to do.

The last part of Grotewohl's speech concerned the Bonn Parliament's response to the People's Chamber's proposal to convene an all-German conference to hold all-German elections. He vehemently condemned the Adenauer government's rejection of the People's Chamber's proposal and pointed out that the People's Chamber's proposal has put the Adenauer government in a very embarrassing situation. Grotewohl said that the Adenauer government's attempt to evade making a clear decision on the issues raised by the People's Chamber will not succeed, and the German people will never tolerate such a thing. The special session of the People's Chamber to be held on October 10th will present a clear answer to the German people and the Federal Parliament, which will help to break the conspiracies of disguise and delay.

Grotewohl finally emphasized that the All-German Conference must be convened before decisions are made on secret negotiations on the re-militarization of Germany, before German youth are sold out, and before a part of the German people are netted into a war pact. Only the unity of Germany, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and the withdrawal of all occupying forces can protect our people from shedding blood and tears again. What the people need, what Germany needs, and what is good for the whole world is a peace treaty with Germany. The government of the German Democratic Republic, keeping these tasks and goals in mind, enters the third year of its establishment with confidence and determination.

    德意志民主共和国国庆典礼上
    格罗提渥报告两年来国家巨大成就
    并痛斥阿登纳政府拒绝人民议会的合理建议
   【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社柏林七日讯：十月六日，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在柏林庆祝德意志民主共和国第二届国庆的典礼上发表演说。他指出：德意志民主共和国的成立，为建立新的、独立自由的德国奠定了基础，这个具有历史意义的日子，是德国人民走向国家的统一、繁荣和持久和平的起点。德意志民主共和国在它成立以来的两年中，已经把全德民主的和爱好和平的力量团结在它的周围，它已经变成德国人民展开争取统一与和平的民族斗争的最巩固的根据地。
    格罗提渥接着叙述了德意志民主共和国两年以来在经济、政治和文化等各方面所获得的成就。他说：在德意志民主共和国，失业已经一去不复返了，货物的贸易量增加了，币值巩固了，自从一九四八年西德实行币制改革后，西德的通货从四十二亿马克增加到了九十一亿马克，而德意志民主共和国的通货则仍然是三十二亿马克。德意志民主共和国马克的购买力，由于劳动生产率的增加和物价减低的结果已经不断地提高了。
    格罗提渥在演说中着重指出了扩大和巩固德国与苏联、各人民民主国家及中华人民共和国的贸易关系的重要性，他说：与上述这些国家进行贸易的可能的巨大的发展，可以保证在统一、民主与爱好和平的德国中的一切企业和每一个健壮的德国人都能有足够的工作做。
    格罗提渥演说的最后一部分谈到波恩议会对于人民议会所提出召开全德会议以举行全德选举的建议的答覆。他痛斥阿登纳政府拒绝人民议会建议的行为，并指出人民议会的建议已使阿登纳政府的处境十分狼狈。格罗提渥说：阿登纳政府企图逃避对人民议会提出的问题作出明确的决定，是不会成功的，德国人民决不能容忍这样的事情。定于十月十日举行的人民议会的特别会议将对德国人民和联邦议会提出明确的答覆，这个答覆将有助于打破伪装和拖延的阴谋。
    格罗提渥最后着重说：全德会议必须在关于德国重新军国主义化的秘密谈判作出决定以前，在德国青年被出卖以前，在德国的一部分人民被网罗在战争公约之内以前召开。只有德国的统一、缔结和约和撤退一切占领军，才能保卫我国人民不再流血和流泪。人民所需要的，德国所需要的，对于整个世界都有好处的就是对德和约。德意志民主共和国政府牢记着这些任务和目标，满怀信心和决心进入它成立的第三年。
