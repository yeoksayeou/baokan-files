    Relentlessly Fighting the Enemy
     Xu Guangping
    On the fifteenth anniversary of Lu Xun's death, as we look back at his life, what is the most prominent characteristic of his life? It is probably his relentless fight against the enemy! If we look at his life, we will immediately recall his sharp, needle-like, dagger-like, and incisive writing, attacking the enemy's vital points, as well as the spirit revealed in his words. Today, as we fight against the American imperialist bandits and their running dogs, I believe that Lu Xun's fighting spirit is still worth promoting, developing, and learning from.
    Chairman Mao said: "Lu Xun's bones are the hardest." Indeed, we need such hard bones to work tirelessly to defend our victory and build our new country!
    Around the May Fourth Movement, when feudal tradition became a major enemy of the Chinese nation's survival, Lu Xun stood on the front line of anti-feudalism, becoming a member of the brave national warriors. He advocated evolution, criticized restoration, shouted for resistance, opposed numbness, and wanted the Chinese people to reform their bad habits. "Otherwise, whether it is autocracy, republic, or whatever, although the signboard is changed, the goods remain the same, it will not work at all." This idea of changing the goods is the ideological remolding that many of us are carrying out now. Without this ideological remolding, we cannot guarantee that our nation can survive healthily.
    On the eve of the "March 18th" massacre, was an extremely acute era for the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism. Many running dogs of the British, American, and Japanese imperialists, who had lost their national consciousness, revealed their tails. At this time, Lu Xun shouted: "I feel that there are many citizens of the Republic of China who are enemies of the Republic of China." He saw from the "March 18th" tragedy: "This is not the end of an event, but the beginning of an event." He said: "Blood debts must be repaid with the same thing. The longer the delay, the greater the interest!" At this time, Lu Xun used his writing as a weapon and also united young people to introduce Soviet literary works to China in order to criticize reactionary things and educate the Chinese people. And at this time, the Chinese Communist Party had gradually grown. Lu Xun felt that he needed to find fresh troops. "He felt that everything had to be done anew." As a national warrior, he said: "Petitioning should be stopped, and continued fighting should be revolution." He could not be quiet. The realist Lu Xun, after arriving in Xiamen, soon became disappointed and moved to Guangzhou again.
    Witnessing the bloody massacre of 1927, witnessing the reactionary rulers betraying the alliance of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he "was stunned by the blood" and left Guangdong, and "due to the lessons of the facts, he believed that only the emerging proletariat had a future." Therefore, he bravely joined the League of Left-Wing Writers. From then on, his pulse beat with the pulse of every national liberation movement. He followed every important stage of the era, working hard for the needs of national survival, appearing on the front line of the ideological battle.
    He stripped off the masks of the warlord executioners, he attacked the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek gang raised by imperialism, and he experienced many difficult environments. These difficult environments, on the contrary, made him more solid, more stubborn, and more courageous. His breathing, his joys and sorrows, his every word and deed, were all permeated with the idea of striving for the liberation of mankind and the Chinese nation. His oath at the age of twenty-one: "I will recommend Xuanyuan with my blood!" was said most thoroughly, and he practiced his promise to the death. He is one of the good sons and daughters who represent our Chinese nation's patriotism! It can be explained from what he said before his death: "I am not only a writer, but also a Chinese." He indeed did become a warrior who fought and bled for the progress and freedom of China. Not only him, but in recent decades China has produced thousands upon thousands of such brave national warriors! From the War of Resistance Against Japan to the War of Liberation, to participating in the great struggle to defend the country and oppose American imperialist aggression, they all have the determination to resist oppression, pursue truth, and strive for the survival of the nation and country. This is the greatest ambition of the most courageous patriots. Only patriots under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have this invincible fighting spirit and strength. The "September 18th" invasion by Japanese imperialism made Lu Xun realize the nationwide people's wave-like unanimous demand for resistance against Japan, which made him spur himself on even more, work harder, and even sacrifice his sick body to shout for the long-term goal. He responded to the call of "the current revolutionary party in China's policy of the anti-Japanese united front proposed to the people of the whole country" and joined this front unconditionally. And this revolutionary party is the Chinese Communist Party. The task of this anti-Japanese united front has long been completed and victory has been achieved. Now, the People's Democratic United Front is even more consolidated, and all parties and groups are strengthening unity and striving to complete the great construction cause of the People's Republic of China.
    Today, the Chinese people are becoming increasingly strong, as Chairman Mao said: making the imperialists tremble. Therefore, the imperialists are jealous of the new China and have used various vile means: spreading rumors, framing, slandering... The aggressive group headed by American imperialism has occupied our Taiwan. The Japanese imperialist plot to invade the Chinese mainland by using Korea as a springboard has reappeared. The American imperialists are delaying negotiations, sabotaging Kaesong neutrality, assassinating, bombing, and violently denying, but their crimes have been clearly exposed to the righteous people of the world, just as Lu Xun said: "Lies can never cover up facts written in blood." Not long ago, the American and British imperialists again manufactured the San Francisco Treaty with Japan, attempting to support Japanese imperialism and rearm Japan in order to threaten our people who have been subjected to Japanese aggression for many years. The People's Republic of China, which has become strong and has gained the support of the people of the world, will not allow such illegal acts by American imperialists; the Chinese people are not afraid of any threats. They understand that preventing the revival of Japanese militarism and completely eliminating the aggression of the American and British groups depends on the further consolidation and strength of our People's Democratic United Front, and on our friendly mutual assistance with the Soviet Union. This is the policy of the Chinese Communist Party, and it is exactly what Lu Xun hoped to achieve during his lifetime. Chairman Mao personally went to Moscow and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which has laid the foundation for the unbreakable friendship between the two countries. If we commemorate Lu Xun's determination to resist imperialism and his spirit of supporting Sino-Soviet friendship, we will be even more satisfied with the great achievements made on all fronts by the new China only two years after its founding!
    Lu Xun, who worked tirelessly to protect national survival, has passed away for fifteen years. During these fifteen years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has defeated Japanese imperialism and the American Chiang Kai-shek gang, and the Chinese people have gone from darkness to light, to the brilliant five-star flag. The new China is growing rapidly, and the people are united as never before under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and are advancing together with the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union to consolidate the strong international peace and democracy front. The road of the new China has been paved and unfolded before us! The warriors who have strived for the liberation, independence, peace, and democracy of the new China for a hundred years, including Lu Xun, have led us through a journey. In the future, we will advance more bravely and confidently along this road. Our work is a true commemoration of them. (Attached image)

    不容情地对敌战斗
     许广平
    在鲁迅逝世了十五周年的今天，我们来回顾他的一生，什么是他的生活中的特点呢？恐怕是他的不容情的对敌人的战斗吧！我们若看看他的一生，立刻就会联想起他那辛辣的，有如针刺，有如匕首般犀利的、扑向敌人要害的文字以及那些透露在文字里的精神。今天我们要向美帝国主义匪帮及其走狗们作斗争，我以为鲁迅的这种战斗精神现在还是值得提倡、发扬和学习的。
    毛主席说过：“鲁迅的骨头是最硬的。”不错，我们的确需要这样的硬骨头，以便为保卫我们的胜利，建设我们的新国家而努力不懈地工作！
    在五四前后，当封建传统成为中国民族生存的大敌时，鲁迅就站在反封建的最前线，成为勇敢的民族战士之一员。他提倡进化，批判复古，呐喊反抗，反对麻木，要国人改革自己的坏根性。“否则，无论是专制，是共和，是什么什么，招牌虽换，货色照旧，全不行的。”这换货色的意思，就是现在我们许多人所进行的思想改造，不进行这个思想改造，就不能保证我们民族能够健旺地生存。
    “三、一八”前夜，是中国人民反对帝国主义斗争极其尖锐的时代，许多丧失民族意识的英、美、日帝国主义的走狗们都露出它的尾巴来了，鲁迅这时呼喊：“我觉得有许多民国国民而是民国的敌人。”他从“三·一八”惨案看出：“这不是一件事的结束，是一件事的开头。”他说：“血债必须用同物偿还。拖欠得愈久，就要付更大的利息！”鲁迅这时用自己的文字作武器，还联合青年们一起介绍苏联文学作品到中国来，以批判反动的东西，教育中国人民。而这时中国共产党已经逐渐成长起来了。鲁迅觉得要找生力军。“觉得什么都要从新做过。”作为民族的战士的他，这样说道：“请愿应该停止，继续战斗应该是革命。”他不能安静下去，现实主义者的鲁迅，到了厦门，不久失望了，就又转到广州。
    目睹一九二七年血淋淋的大屠杀，目睹反动统治者背弃国共合作的盟言，他“被血吓得目瞪口呆”而离开了广东，并且“由于事实的教训，以为唯有新兴的无产者才有将来”。因此，他勇敢地参加了左翼作家联盟。自此以后，他的脉搏随着每一次民族解放运动的脉搏的跳动而跳动。他跟着时代的每一个重要阶段，为着民族生存的需要而努力，出现在思想战线的最前线。
    他剥掉军阀刽子手们的假面具，他打击帝国主义所豢养的卖国求荣的蒋匪帮，他经历了许多艰苦环境。这些艰苦环境反而把他锻炼得更坚实，更倔强，更勇敢。他的呼吸，他的喜怒，他的每一言动，无不贯穿着为了人类，为了中华民族的解放而努力的思想。他二十一岁时的誓言：“我以我血荐轩辕！”说得最彻底，他至死不渝地实践了他的诺言。他是代表我们中华民族爱国主义的好子孙的一人！从他临死前所说的话可以说明：“我不但是一个作家，而且是一个中国人。”他的确做到了为中国的进步和自由而战斗、流血的一个战士。不仅是他，近数十年来中国曾经产生了千千万万这样勇敢的民族战士！他们从抗日战争到解放战争，到参加保家卫国、反对美帝国主义侵略的伟大斗争，他们都有反抗压迫、追求真理为争取国家民族的生存而奋斗的决心。这是最勇敢的爱国主义者的最伟大的志向。只有在马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想教导之下的爱国主义者，才有这不可战胜的斗志和力量。 “九、一八”日本帝国主义的侵略，使鲁迅认识到全国人民怒潮般一致要求抗日的思想，使他更加鞭策自己，更加努力奋斗，甚至不惜牺牲自己的病体，为了远大的目的而呼号。他响应了“中国目前的革命的政党向全国人民所提出的抗日统一战线的政策”的号召，无条件地加入了这个战线。而这革命的政党也即是中国共产党。这抗日统一战线的任务早已完成，获得了胜利。现在，人民民主统一战线更加巩固，各党派、各团体，加强团结，为完成中华人民共和国的伟大建设事业而奋斗。
    今天中国人民日益强大，正如毛主席所说：使得帝国主义发抖。因此，帝国主义者嫉恨新中国，施展了各种卑污手段：造谣，陷害，诬蔑……。以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，霸占了我们的台湾。日本帝国主义以朝鲜为跳板侵略中国大陆的鬼计，已再度出现。美帝国主义者拖延谈判，破坏开城中立，暗杀，轰炸，横暴抵赖，但是他们的罪行已经清楚地暴露在全世界正义人民面前，正如鲁迅所说的：“谎话，决掩不住血写的事实。”不久以前，美英帝国主义者又在旧金山制造对日和约，企图扶植日本帝国主义，重新武装日本，以威胁我曾经多年遭受日本侵略的人民。已经强大起来并且获得全世界人民支持的中华人民共和国是不容许美帝国主义者这种非法行为的；中国人民是不怕任何威胁的。他们懂得要防止日本军国主义的复活，彻底消灭美英集团的侵略，有赖于我人民民主统一战线的更加巩固与强大，有赖于我们与苏联友好互助。这是中国共产党所坚持的方针、政策，也正是鲁迅生前所希望做到的事。毛主席亲自到莫斯科，订立了中苏友好同盟互助条约，已经奠定了两国牢不可破的友谊。我们倘若纪念鲁迅的反抗帝国主义的决心，以及拥护中苏友好的精神，则我们会更加满意于新中国成立才二周年就在各个战线上所获得的伟大成就！
    为保障民族生存而努力不懈地工作的鲁迅，已经逝世了十五周年，在这十五年当中，中国人民解放军已经击溃了日本帝国主义与美蒋匪帮，中国人民已从黑暗走到光明，走到灿烂的五星旗帜之下。新的中国正在飞跃地成长，人民在伟大的毛主席与中国共产党的领导下，空前地团结一致，和以苏联为首的人民民主国家一道迈进，以巩固强大的国际和平民主阵线。新中国的路已经铺平、展开在我们前面了！百年来为争取解放、独立、和平、民主的新中国的战士们，连鲁迅在内，他们已经带领我们走过一段路程了，今后我们将更加勇敢、充满信心沿着这条道路前进。我们的工作就是对他们的真正的纪念。（附图片）
