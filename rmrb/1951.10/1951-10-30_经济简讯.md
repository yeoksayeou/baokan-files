    Economic Briefs
    ▲The National Railway Exhibition closed on October 25th. During the exhibition, the audience was extremely enthusiastic, reaching 300,000 people. Many workers and technicians carefully studied the various innovations and asked the staff to write down the principles, functions, and manufacturing methods of these innovations in detail. After visiting the exhibition, the peasants clearly understood the role of railways in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and in boosting the economy. They said, "The more the railways develop, the better our lives will be." Students visited with great enthusiasm to see the inventions of the working class. After hearing about the effectiveness of the rail-splitting machine, a university student asked the exhibition staff for the name of the worker who created the machine.
    ▲National paper industry production is developing steadily. According to the current situation, this year's paper production may exceed the original plan. Due to the strengthening of machine maintenance, improved labor organization, and improved technology in paper mills across the country, the quality of paper is gradually improving, and costs are also lower than in the past. The tensile strength, break rate, and whiteness of newsprint have been improved; insulating paper, which used to rely on imports, has now been successfully trial-produced by paper mills in Tianjin and Shanghai. The production costs of factories directly under the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government have decreased by an average of 2.34 percent in the first half of this year.
    ▲The afforestation task of Liaodong Province this year was originally more than 6,000 hectares (each hectare equals 15 mu), and more than 3,000 hectares have been completed in spring and the rainy season. At the provincial government's forestry policy expansion meeting in July, it was decided that in addition to continuing to complete the original task, another 30,000 hectares would be afforested. The focus of this afforestation is to create water source forests and protection forests in the Hunhe River, Taizi River basin, and coastal areas, and to gradually eliminate the province's barren mountains and sandy wasteland, transform the natural environment, and guarantee agricultural production.
    ▲The navigation industry of the Sichuan River has been further developed due to the implementation of the policy of low-interest and high-volume transportation to promote the exchange of goods. Compared with the same period last year, the volume of goods entering and leaving the Chongqing wharf from January to August this year increased by 85 percent for incoming goods and 82 percent for outgoing goods. At present, the freight rate of Sichuan River shipping has been reduced by one-third compared with January last year. After the freight rate was reduced, the increase in the output of local products was very significant. For example, after the freight rate for local products was reduced in February, the output of gallnuts from the Chongqing wharf in March increased by 83 percent compared with January.

    经济简讯
    ▲全国铁路展览会已于十月二十五日闭幕。展览期间观众极为踊跃，共达三十万人。许多工人、技术人员非常细心地研究各种创制品，要求大会工作人员把这些创制品的原理、功用及其制造方法详细地写出来。农民们看了展览会之后，清楚地了解到铁路对于城乡物资交流、繁荣经济所起的作用，他们说：“铁路越发展，我们的日子越好过。”学生们怀着极高的热情来参观工人阶级的创造发明。一位大学生在听完关于钢轨劈裂机的效能后，就向展览会工作人员打听创制这台机器的工人的姓名。
    ▲全国造纸工业生产正在稳步发展。根据目前情况来看，今年的纸张生产可超过原订计划。由于各地纸厂加强机器检修、改善劳动组织和改进了技术，纸张的品质正逐渐提高，成本也比过去降低。新闻纸的拉力、断头率和白度都有改进；过去依靠进口供应的绝缘纸，现在天津、上海的纸厂已试制成功。中央人民政府轻工业部直属各厂的生产成本今年上半年内平均降低百分之二点三四。
    ▲辽东省今年的造林任务原为六千多垧（每垧合十五市亩），春季和雨季已完成了三千多垧。七月该省人民政府林政扩大会议上，确定除继续完成原任务外，又布置造林三万垧。此次造林以营造浑河、太子河流域及滨海地区的水源林和防护林为重点，并将逐年逐步地消灭全省的山荒和沙荒，改造自然环境，保障农业生产。
    ▲川江航运业由于执行了低利多运促进物资交流的方针，已得到进一步的发展。重庆码头今年一至八月的进、出货物量和去年同期比较，进货增加了百分之八十五，出货增加了百分之八十二。目前，川江航运的运价已比去年一月降低了三分之一。运价降低后，土产输出量的增加十分显著。如二月份降低土产运价后，三月份重庆码头五倍子的输出量即比一月份增加了百分之八十三。
