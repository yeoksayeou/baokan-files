Firmly Implement the Marriage Law and Protect Women's Rights!
Suggestion: County and District People's Representative Conferences Discuss the Government Administration Council's Instructions on Implementing the Marriage Law
To the Editor:

    From the recent instructions issued by the Government Administration Council and news reports in the newspapers, it can be seen that since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, there are still many problems in the implementation and enforcement of the Marriage Law in various places.

    The formulation, promulgation, and implementation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China are the result of the long-term struggle of the Chinese working people and one of the victorious fruits of the people's revolution. In the countryside, we have destroyed the feudal rule of the landlords and liberated thousands upon thousands of oppressed peasants; we must also thoroughly eliminate the remnants of feudal ideology in order to completely liberate the vast number of young men and women, especially the vast number of women.

    If women are not liberated from feudal shackles, they cannot enjoy the rights of democratic life, which will affect the construction of our people's democratic political power and the development of large-scale national economic construction. Therefore, the implementation of the Marriage Law is not only a matter related to women, but also a matter for every person who loves the motherland.

    To ensure that the Marriage Law is correctly implemented, it is first necessary to correct some incorrect understandings among cadres and the people, so that everyone is good at mastering and implementing national laws. Therefore, I suggest that the county and district people's representative conferences should, in conjunction with the Government Administration Council's instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, conduct discussions on this issue. Because the current marriage disputes mainly exist in rural areas, and the representatives of county and district people's representative conferences mostly come from rural areas. In this way, discussing the spirit and content of the Marriage Law in the meeting can not only enable everyone to reach a consensus in their thinking, but also make resolutions that the representatives can take back to the countryside for implementation, assist the government in doing a good job in inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, and implement the Marriage Law.

    坚决贯彻执行婚姻法，保障妇女权利！
    建议县区各界人民代表会议讨论政务院指示贯彻婚姻法编辑同志：
    从最近政务院发布的指示和报纸上的新闻报道中可以看出，婚姻法公布以来，各地对于婚姻法的贯彻和执行还存在着不少问题。
    中华人民共和国婚姻法的制定和公布施行，是我国劳动人民长期奋斗的结果，是人民革命的胜利果实之一。我们在农村中摧毁了地主的封建统治，解放了千千万万受压迫的农民；我们还必须彻底消除封建思想的残余，才能完全解放广大青年男女，特别是广大妇女。
    妇女不从封建桎梏下解放出来，就不能享受民主生活的权利，就会影响我们人民民主政权建设和国家大规模经济建设的开展。因此，贯彻婚姻法不仅是与妇女有关的事，而且也是每一个热爱祖国的人的事。
    要使婚姻法正确贯彻下去，首先要纠正干部及人民群众中某些不正确的认识，使大家善于掌握和执行国家的法令。因此，我建议县、区各界人民代表会议，应结合政务院关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示，对此一问题展开讨论。因为目前婚姻纠纷主要存在于农村，而县、区人民代表会议的代表，多来自农村。这样，在会议中讨论了婚姻法的精神和内容，不但可以使大家在思想上得到一致的认识，而且也可做出决议，由代表带回农村贯彻执行，协助政府做好检查婚姻法执行情况的工作，并贯彻婚姻法。矛剑
