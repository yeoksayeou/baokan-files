    Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Production and Disaster Relief
    Although the disaster situation in the country this year is not serious, in some areas, the disaster situation is very serious. According to statistics from Yunnan, northern Sichuan, Guizhou and other places in May alone, there were 154 counties with more than 4.6 million people affected by disasters. In Chahar Province, the number of disaster victims exceeded three million. However, some Party members in the disaster areas turn a blind eye to the serious disaster situation and are indifferent to the urgent demands of the disaster-stricken masses, using the excuse that "disaster-stricken areas across the country are a line, and bumper harvests are a large area," neglecting and relaxing production and disaster relief work. For example, in Wanquan County, Chahar Province, production and disaster relief work was not regarded as the central task of the county until the beginning of October; the armed forces department of Datong County was still buried in training militiamen. In other areas, no attention was paid to this work at all, and even the specific disaster situation was unknown. As a result, some disaster-stricken people are uneasy, even pessimistic and disappointed, because of the difficulties in their lives and no one to help them, and some sell their livestock and farm tools in preparation for fleeing the famine. This extremely serious situation must not be allowed to continue to develop, and ways must be found to stop it immediately.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "We should pay deep attention to the problems of the masses' lives, from land and labor problems to firewood, rice, oil and salt problems." But some Party members in the disaster areas, even ignoring the disaster relief work that is "a matter of life and death," how serious this bureaucracy is!
    All Party organizations in disaster-stricken areas, especially those with serious disaster situations, must make production and disaster relief work their overriding central task. All matters unrelated to or not closely related to production and disaster relief should be suspended or postponed in order to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in production and disaster relief. To this end, it is necessary to educate Party members to deeply understand that production and disaster relief work is a major political task related to the lives of millions of people and the country's economic construction. If production and disaster relief work is not done well, it will not only cause huge difficulties for next year's production work, but also make it impossible for other work to proceed smoothly; not only will production in disaster areas not be restored, but economic construction in other areas will also be affected. Therefore, every Communist Party member in the disaster area must do their best to do a good job in production and disaster relief.

### 认真做好生产救灾工作

    认真做好生产救灾工作
    今年全国的灾情虽然并不严重，但是在若干地区，灾情是非常严重的。仅据云南、川北、贵州等地五月份的统计，即有一百五十四个县，四百六十万以上人口被灾。察哈尔全省灾民在三百万以上。但是灾区的某些党员，却对严重的灾情熟视无睹，对被灾群众的迫切要求漠不关心，而藉口“全国被灾地区是一条线，丰收是一大片”，忽视与放松了生产救灾工作。例如：察哈尔省万全县到十月初，还没有把生产救灾工作当作全县的中心任务；大同县的武装部还在埋头训练民兵。另有些地区，根本就没有注意到这一工作，连具体的灾情也不知道。这样，有些被灾群众因为生活困难，又无人给想办法，而表现惶惶不安，甚至悲观失望，有的则卖掉牲口农具，准备逃荒。这种极端严重的情况，决不能再任其继续发展，必须立即设法使之停止。
    毛主席教导说：“我们应该深刻地注意群众生活的问题，从土地、劳动问题，到柴米油盐问题。”可是灾区的部分党员，甚至对“人命关天”的救灾工作都置之不理，这是多么严重的官僚主义！
    被灾地区，特别是灾情严重地区的一切党组织，必须把生产救灾工作作为压倒一切的中心任务。一切和生产救灾无关的，或关系不大的事情，都应该停办或缓办，以便集中力量，作好生产救灾工作。为此必须教育党员深刻地认识：生产救灾工作是关系千百万人生命，关系国家经济建设的重大的政治任务。如果不作好生产救灾工作，不仅会给明年的生产工作造成巨大困难，就是其他工作也无法顺利进行；不仅灾区的生产不能恢复，就是其他地区的经济建设也会受到影响。因此，灾区的每一个共产党员都必须以全力来作好生产救灾工作。
