    Editor's Note: Sun Desheng, head of the Vietnamese People's Observation Delegation invited to participate in our National Day celebrations, Honorary Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, Chairman of the Vietnam National United Front, and President of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association, went to Northeast China for a visit on the 8th of this month. This is an article he wrote at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, which was broadcast on the 18th.

    Although we in Vietnam had some understanding of the situation in New China from many materials and through contact with many Chinese friends, we were still amazed when we stepped into the land of New China and saw the concrete achievements of the Chinese people. Although our stay was short, and we did not go to many places, only participating in the National Day celebrations in Beijing, passing through some places from Nanning to Beijing, and visiting the suburbs of Beijing, the things we saw with our own eyes made us excited and made us love New China even more.

    In Tiananmen Square, a solemn and grand National Day military parade was held. Those reviewed included the army, navy, and air force, with the latest weapons, jet planes, and huge parade contingents from all walks of life, carrying countless red flags, production charts, and huge portraits of leaders of people from all countries. Slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party," and "Peace Will Triumph" resounded through the clouds. All of this, coupled with the cheerful movements and expressions of the Chinese people, made us appreciate the greatness of the strength of the Chinese military and people. The Chinese people love their leader, place their hopes on the Communist Party, which is their vanguard, and have unlimited confidence in the future of their nation and the world. All the national representatives participating in the National Day ceremony jointly celebrated this happy day.

    Everywhere in China, one can see slogans of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and patriotic pacts, which are being effectively implemented; countless people have responded to these slogans, formed the Chinese People's Volunteers, donated airplanes and artillery, and implemented them in every Chinese person's daily work.

    More than 340 million people have signed the peace declaration, and more than 330 million people have voted against arming Japan. This number fully demonstrates the Chinese people's determination to defend peace.

    What excites us the most is that the new Chinese people, educated and nurtured in the struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, have already made amazing achievements. Workers are vigorously building bridges, roads, and houses; farmers are gathering to discuss land reform and increase production; in the enthusiastic farewell lines, soldiers march on the journey of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, full of fighting spirit; honest merchants are selling goods with marked prices and not evading taxes; Chinese friends serving foreign guests during the National Day are working very actively and consciously, demonstrating a high degree of internationalism; children are innocent, lively, strong, and intelligent. When we were in Nanning, we saw children going to the river to fish in their spare time, donating all the money they earned to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend their country. Today, almost all Chinese people are consciously working for the welfare of the country and for their personal progress.

    China's ancient cultural relics have been protected. Good works are valued and developed as they should be, combined with new ideological content. Newspapers, magazines, operas, dances, and movies are all playing a new educational role for the masses of the people.

    All of this is due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and because the Chinese people love their motherland and love peace; this powerfully guarantees the establishment of a forever prosperous New China, and at the same time guarantees that it will make a greater contribution to defending peace in Asia and peace in the world.

    Cheer for the splendid achievements of the Chinese people. The Vietnamese people will learn more from New China.

    为中国人民辉煌的成就而欢呼
    越南  孙德胜
    编者按：应邀参加我国国庆节的越南人民观礼代表团团长、越南总工会名誉主席、越南国民联合战线主席、越苏友好协会会长孙德胜，已于本月八日赴东北参观，这是他应中央人民广播电台之邀所写的文章，该台已于十八日广播。
    尽管我们在越南的时候，从很多材料当中，在和很多中国朋友接触当中，对于新中国的情况已经有了一些认识；然而，当我们踏进新中国的国土，看到中国人民的具体的成就的时候，仍然使我们感到了惊奇。虽然我们逗留的时间不长，到的地方不多，仅仅在北京参加了国庆节，走过了从南宁到北京的一些地方和访问了北京的郊区等，但是我们亲眼见到的事物，都使我们感到兴奋，使我们更爱新中国。
    在天安门，举行了庄严而隆重的国庆阅兵典礼。受检阅的有陆、空、海军，有最新式的武器，有喷气式飞机，有各界人民的巨大的游行队伍，带着无数面的红旗、生产图表和各国人民领袖的巨幅画像。“毛主席万岁”，“中国共产党万岁”，“和平胜利”等口号响彻云霄。这一切，加上中国人民的愉快的动作和表情，使我们体会到中国军民力量的伟大。中国人民热爱自己的领袖，把希望寄托在做为自己的先锋的政党——共产党的身上，对自己的民族和世界的前途抱着无限的信心。当天参加国庆典礼的所有各国人民观礼代表，都共同欢度了这个快乐的日子。
    在中国，到处都可以看到抗美援朝的口号和爱国公约，而且很有效地加以实现了；无数的人响应了这些口号，组成了中国人民志愿军，捐献了飞机和大炮，并且贯彻到每个中国人的日常工作中去。
    有三亿四千多万人在和平宣言上签了名、三亿三千多万人参加投票反对武装日本，这个数目字已经充分表明中国人民保卫和平的决心。
    最使我们兴奋的是：在毛主席、中国共产党的领导下，在斗争当中教育培养出来的新中国人民，已经有了惊人的成就。工人们起劲地修建桥梁、道路，建筑房屋；农民集会讨论土地改革问题和增加生产；在热烈的欢送行列里，战士们充满斗志地走上抗美援朝的征途；诚实的商人明码买卖，不漏税；在国庆节为各国外宾服务的中国朋友们，很积极自觉地工作，表现出高度的国际主义精神，小朋友们，天真、活泼、结实和聪明。我们在南宁的时候，看到小朋友们在空闲的时间到河边去钓鱼，把卖得的钱全部作为抗美援朝保家卫国的捐献。今天，几乎所有的中国人都自觉地为国家的福利和为个人的进步而工作着。
    中国的古代文化遗物都得到了保护。好作品都被重视，结合着新的思想内容得到应有的发展。报纸、杂志、歌剧、舞蹈、电影等都对人民群众起了新的教育作用。
    这一切，都是由于有了毛主席、中国共产党的英明领导，由于中国人民热爱自己的祖国、热爱和平；这就有力地保证了建立起永远欣欣向荣的新中国，同时也保证了：对于保卫亚洲和平和世界和平将有更大的贡献。
    为中国人民的辉煌的成就而欢呼。越南人民将更多地向新中国学习。
