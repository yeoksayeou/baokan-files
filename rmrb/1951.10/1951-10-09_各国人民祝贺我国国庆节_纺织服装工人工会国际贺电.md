Xinhua News Agency — The Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Unions International sent a letter to Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, congratulating our country on its second National Day. The original letter is as follows: Dear Comrades:
    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Unions International (Industry Department of the World Federation of Trade Unions) extends its heartfelt congratulations to all textile workers belonging to your union. They, together with the strong Chinese nation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, are building a new and happy life.
    The prosperity of the national economy, including the textile industry, and the construction of a new and happy life no longer oppressed by international imperialists and domestic exploiters, is an inspiration to the people of Asia who are fighting for freedom and independence.
    The Chinese people are giving fraternal support to the Korean people who are fighting against the bloody American imperialists. This is a clear proof of friendship and the greatest proletarian internationalism, and a major contribution to the cause of the struggle for peace.
    On behalf of the five million textile workers participating in the Trade Unions International, we warmly wish you more achievements in building a new life and promoting the prosperity of the culture, science and art of the People's New China.
    Long live the People's Republic of China and its leader Mao Zedong!
    Long live international solidarity and workers' solidarity!
    Long live the fortress of peace - the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great leader of the working class, Stalin!

        Boursky, Secretary-General of the Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Unions International

    值此中华人民共和国成立二周年纪念日，纺织服装工人工会国际（世界工联产业部）向属于你们工会的所有纺织工人致以衷心的贺意。他们和强大的全中国民族一起在共产党及其领袖毛泽东的领导下，建设着新的幸福的生活。
    国民经济，包括纺织工业的兴旺，与不再受国际帝国主义者和国内剥削者的压迫的新的幸福生活的建设，对于为自由与独立而战斗的亚洲人民是一种鼓舞。
