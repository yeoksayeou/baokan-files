Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, military spending has soared and deficits have become huge, causing the economic situation to deteriorate day by day.

Before launching the war of aggression against Korea, the Truman government requested 13.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of 1950 for its so-called "Cold War" as direct military expenditure for the 1951 fiscal year starting from July 1, 1950. After the "hot war" in Korea broke out, military spending was increased three times in less than a year, more than doubling the total military expenditure for the previous year to 48 billion U.S. dollars. This figure is more than double the military expenditure in the first year (1941-1942) when the United States joined World War II.

Now, due to the huge consumption of the Korean War and the stepped-up comprehensive war preparations, U.S. military spending continues to soar, creating a new record for military expenditure in history. The military budget directly used for the armed forces in the current fiscal year (July 1, 1951 to June 30, 1952), which was finally passed by the U.S. Congress this month, amounted to as high as 57 billion U.S. dollars, which is three times more than the military expenditure of more than 14 billion U.S. dollars in the fiscal year before the outbreak of the Korean War. In addition, more than 5.8 billion U.S. dollars were approved for military base construction and national defense activities, and more than 7.3 billion U.S. dollars for the so-called "common security plan" for armed vassal states. The above items add up to an astronomical figure of more than 70 billion U.S. dollars, exceeding the total military expenditure of 63 billion U.S. dollars in the second year of World War II. This huge military expenditure of more than 70 billion U.S. dollars does not include the direct consumption on the Korean battlefield, and the amount of this consumption is extremely large. According to Harvard, the logistics commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, announced in late September, the U.S. military in Korea spent 1.6 billion U.S. dollars on ammunition alone in half a year, and more than 3 billion U.S. dollars including transportation and storage costs. According to some "well-informed sources" in the United States, the Korean War requires 10 billion to 20 billion U.S. dollars in special expenditures every year. If we add this huge amount that is kept secret by the authorities and other so-called "support for national defense" expenses (including the research and manufacturing of atomic weapons, etc.), the total military expenditure will exceed 90 billion U.S. dollars, exceeding the military expenditure of 90 billion U.S. dollars in 1944-1945, the year with the largest expenditure during World War II.

The Truman government's desperately expanded military expenditure has obviously exceeded the extent that the U.S. economy can support, thus suffering more and more difficulties and bad consequences. Huge military spending has led to a sharp increase in the U.S. fiscal deficit. In order to make up for the deficit, the Truman government adopted the policy of draining the pond to catch the fish by increasing taxes and abusing currency. People's tax burden has increased sharply with the increase in military spending. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the Truman government has implemented three tax increases, making the average tax burden of the American people more than 50% higher than before the Korean War. At present, the federal tax amount plus the local tax amount in the United States has far exceeded 80 billion U.S. dollars, which is more than 70% higher than the peak during World War II. However, this policy of unlimited tax increases by the U.S. government has failed to solve the problem of its huge deficit. The income and expenditure gap in the first two months of this year (July and August) was more than 3.6 billion U.S. dollars; the total deficit of this year, even according to the materials published by the U.S. government, will still reach tens of billions of U.S. dollars after the third tax increase of 5.7 billion U.S. dollars has been implemented. On the other hand, this tax increase policy has aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the American people, whose burden was already very heavy. This dissatisfaction has formed such a pressure that the members of the Democratic and Republican parties, in the face of the upcoming general election next year, disregarded Truman's repeated appeals and cut nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars from the total of the above-mentioned military budgets originally proposed by Truman, and at the same time cut almost half of the third tax increase of 10 billion U.S. dollars originally proposed by Truman. The U.S. Information Service admitted that the reason given by the congressmen who opposed this unlimited tax increase was that they were afraid that it "would lead to the bankruptcy of the country."

As for the U.S. government's policy of abusing currency, it has caused serious inflation in the United States. The adverse impact of the development of U.S. inflation on finance since the beginning of the Korean War has been revealed in a report by Wilson, Director of the U.S. "Defense Mobilization Agency" on July 4. According to him, due to inflation, the U.S. government spent 7 billion U.S. dollars more in purchasing military supplies and supplying military needs in one year of the Korean War. Therefore, Wilson said worriedly in a speech on the 8th of this month that the United States is currently entering "a period of being under real inflationary pressure."

The economic disaster caused by the huge military expenditure exceeding the normal economic strength of the United States, as well as the increasingly strong dissatisfaction and opposition of the broad masses of the American people, are one of the fundamental and insurmountable weaknesses of U.S. imperialism in carrying out the war of aggression against Korea and stepping up preparations for new wars.

    【新华社二十九日讯】美国自发动侵略朝鲜的战争以来，军费激增，赤字巨大，使经济情况日益恶化。
    在发动侵略朝鲜的战争以前，杜鲁门政府于一九五○年上半年曾为它的所谓“冷战”要求了一百三十五亿美元，作为从一九五○年七月一日起的一九五一年度的直接军事经费。朝鲜的“热战”发生后，在不到一年的时间中接连增加了三次军费，使上年度军费总额陡增两倍半以上，共达四百八十亿美元。这个数目超过美国加入第二次世界大战时第一年度（一九四一年至一九四二年）的军费一倍以上。
    现在，由于朝鲜战争的巨大消耗和加紧全面备战，美国的军费的开支继续猛涨，创造了历史上军费支出的新纪录。美国国会在本月最后通过的本年度（一九五一年七月一日至一九五二年六月三十日）直接用于武装部队的军费预算，为数高达五百七十亿美元，和朝鲜战争爆发前一年度的军费一百四十余亿美元相较，增加了三倍。此外，还通过了五十八亿余美元的军事基地建筑与国防活动费，和武装仆从国家的七十三亿余美元的所谓“共同安全计划”。以上数项共达七百余亿美元的天文学数字，超过第二次大战中第二年度的全部军费。那一年度全部军费共为六百三十亿元。这笔七百余亿美元的巨额军费还不包括朝鲜战场的直接消耗，而这一笔消耗的数目则极为庞大。据美国第八军的后勤司令哈佛特在九月下旬宣布，在朝鲜美军，仅弹药一项，半年就化费了十六亿美元，如加上运费与保管费，共超过三十亿美元以上。据美国的某些“消息灵通人士”私下估计，朝鲜战争打下去，每年需要一百亿到二百亿美元的特别开支。如果加上这笔官方秘而不宣的巨大数目以及其他所谓“支持国防”的费用（包括原子武器的研究及制造等），则军费总额将突破九百亿美元，超出第二次世界大战期间开支最大的一九四四—一九四五年度的军事费用，那一年度共化了九百亿美元。
    杜鲁门政府拼命予以扩大的军费支出，显然已超过美国经济能支持的程度，从而遭受到愈来愈多的困难和恶果。巨大的军费开支已使美国的财政赤字激增。为了弥补赤字，杜鲁门政府采取了竭泽而渔的大量增税和滥发通货的政策。人民的税收负担已随着军事开支的加大而激增。从朝鲜战争爆发后，杜鲁门政府已实行三次增税，使美国人民每人平均捐税负担较朝鲜战争以前增加了百分之五十以上。目前美国联邦税额加上地方税额，已远超过八百亿美元，比第二次大战时期最高峰还多百分之七十以上。但是，美国政府这种无限制增税的政策，一方面并未能解决其巨大赤字的难题。本年度头两个月
    （七月和八月）的收支亏空了三十六亿多美元；本年度的全部赤字，即使据美官方发表的材料估计，在已实行了第三次增税五十七亿美元以后，仍将达数十亿美元之巨。另一方面这种增税政策已激起负担本来已经十分沉重的美国广大人民日益强烈的不满。这种不满已经形成这样一种压力，以至民主、共和两党的议员们在明年要举行大选的前景下，不顾杜鲁门的再三呼吁，而将杜鲁门原来所提出的上述数项军事预算总共削减了近六十亿美元，同时把杜鲁门原来所提出的第三次一百亿美元的增税额削去几乎一半。美国新闻处承认，反对这种无限度增税的议员们所持的理由是他们害怕这样“会促成国家的破产”。
    至于美国政府滥发通货的政策，已给美国造成了严重的通货膨胀。朝鲜战争开始以来美国通货膨胀之发展对于财政的恶性影响，已从美国“国防动员署”署长威尔生七月四日的一次报告中透露了出来。据他说：朝鲜战争一年间，由于通货膨胀，美国政府在购买军火与供应军需方面就多花了七十亿美元。因此，威尔生在本月八日一次演说中忧虑地说，美国目前正进入“受到真正的通货膨胀压力的时期”。
    超过美国正常经济力量的庞大军费所引起的经济上的灾难，以及广大美国人民日益强烈的不满和反对，这是美帝国主义在进行侵朝战争和加紧准备新战争中所遇到的根本的不可克服的弱点之一。
