    Good Plays Should Not Be Performed Vulgarity
    To the Editor:
    On September 23rd, I went to Tianqiao in Beijing and saw many new artistic programs being performed in the square. This is a good phenomenon. However, some of the programs were performed very poorly. For example, "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" was originally a good play showcasing the production enthusiasm of liberated peasants, but the Xingmin Troupe performed it very badly. In this play, we saw the brother taking many egregious actions towards his sister. This unserious approach destroyed the educational significance of the original play. This is very inappropriate.

### 不应把好戏演得下流了

    不应把好戏演得下流了编辑同志：
    九月二十三日，我到北京市天桥游玩，看见广场上演出了许多新的文艺节目，这是好现象。但是，有些节目演得很糟糕。像“兄妹开荒”，原是一出表现翻身农民生产热情的好戏，醒民剧团却把这出戏演得十分恶劣。我们在这出戏中，看到了哥哥对妹妹做出了许多恶劣的行动。这种不严肃的作风，把原剧的教育意义破坏了。这是很不应该的。
