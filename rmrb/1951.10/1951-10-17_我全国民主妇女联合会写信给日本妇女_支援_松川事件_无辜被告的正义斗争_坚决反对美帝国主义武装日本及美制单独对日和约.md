(Report from this newspaper) The All-China Democratic Women's Federation wrote to Japanese women on the 16th of this month, expressing that Chinese women are determined to fully support the just struggle of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's rearming of Japan and the separate peace treaty with Japan. The full text of the original letter is as follows:

Dear Japanese Sisters:

    Not long ago, we received a letter from Takeo Nikaido, an innocent defendant in the "Matsukawa Incident," addressed to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In our "People's Daily," letters from Saito Sen, Kobayashi Genzaburo, and others were also published. From these letters, we have seen the heroic spirit of the Japanese working class in the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries; we have learned that the broad masses of Japanese men and women are waging an unyielding struggle, and that a just movement for "one million signatures demanding the innocent release" is unfolding in Japan regarding the "Matsukawa Incident."

    Despite the U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Japanese government doing everything possible to block the friendship and exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese people, the eyes of Chinese women and the Chinese people are constantly watching your heroic struggle; we care about the fate of Japan and the lives of the Japanese people.

    Dear Sisters, you have already realized that it is the American imperialists and the reactionary Yoshida government who are trampling on the Japanese people and women like slaves, and plunging the lives of the Japanese people into misery. The "Matsukawa Incident" is just one of the shameless crimes of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in their brutal persecution of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people. You already know what your struggle goals and path are, and you are fighting together with the Japanese people, resolutely opposing the rearming of Japan and the separate peace treaty with Japan, and striving for Japan's democracy and independence.

    Chinese women and the Chinese people are extremely indignant at the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Yoshida government in persecuting the Japanese working class and the Japanese people; we are determined to fully support the just struggle of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's rearming of Japan and the separate peace treaty with Japan. Our entire country is continuing to tirelessly strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, which is not only to defend our own motherland and the independence of Korea, but also to support the struggle of the Japanese people and Japanese women against the American imperialists.

    Dear Sisters, we extend our warm and friendly hands to you. Let our two peoples and women unite closely to oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism and defend peace in Asia and the world!

                    All-China Democratic Women's Federation

    我全国民主妇女联合会写信给日本妇女
    支援“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争
    坚决反对美帝国主义武装日本及美制单独对日和约
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会于本月十六日写信给日本妇女，表示中国妇女决以全力支援“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争，并坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本与单独对日和约。原信全文如下：亲爱的日本姊妹们：
    不久前我们收到了“松川事件”无辜被告二阶堂武夫给中华全国民主妇女联合会和中华全国总工会女工部的信。在我国的“人民日报”上，也发表了斋藤千、小林源三郎等的来信。从这些信件中，我们看到了日本工人阶级在反对美日反动派的斗争中的英雄气概；我们知道了日本的广大男女人民正在不屈不挠地进行斗争，和日本国内对“松川事件”正在展开着“百万人签名要求无罪释放”的正义运动的情况。
    尽管美帝国主义和日本反动政府想尽办法来阻断中日两国人民间的友谊与往来，但是中国妇女和中国人民的眼睛是经常注视着你们的英勇斗争的；我们关怀着日本国家的命运，也关怀着日本人民的生活。
    亲爱的姊妹们，你们已经认识到：把日本人民与妇女当做奴隶一样来蹂躏，使日本人民的生活陷于悲惨境地的是美国帝国主义者和吉田反动政府。“松川事件”不过是美日反动派凶残地迫害日本工人阶级和日本人民的无耻罪行之一。你们已经知道：什么是你们的斗争的目标和奋斗的道路，你们正和日本人民在一起，坚决地为反对重新武装日本和单独对日和约，争取日本的民主与独立而斗争着。
    中国妇女和中国人民对于美帝国主义和吉田反动政府迫害日本工人阶级和日本人民的罪行，感到万分愤慨；我们决用全力来支援“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争。我们坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本和单独对日和约。我们全国正在继续不懈地加强抗美援朝运动，这不仅是为了保卫自己的祖国，保卫朝鲜的独立，同时也是支援日本人民和日本妇女反对美帝国主义者的斗争。
    亲爱的姊妹们，我们向你们伸出热情和友爱的手。让我们两国人民与妇女紧紧团结起来，反对美帝国主义的侵略，保卫亚洲与世界的和平！
                    中华全国民主妇女联合会
                    一九五一年十月十六日
