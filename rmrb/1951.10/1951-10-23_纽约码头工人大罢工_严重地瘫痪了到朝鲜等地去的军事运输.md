    New York Dockworkers' Strike
    Seriously Paralyzes Military Transport to North Korea and Other Places [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch] New York News: New York dockworkers belonging to the International Longshoremen's Association of the American Federation of Labor have been on strike spontaneously since the 15th to protest the unfair new contract recently signed by the union's leadership and the shipping companies. This strike has seriously paralyzed military and commercial transport from New York to Korea and other war bases. As of the evening of the 21st, the number of strikers had exceeded 6,000, and loading and unloading operations at hundreds of docks in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Manhattan had completely stopped. More than sixty ships were frozen as a result. According to Reuters, "Army ships carrying everything 'from soybeans to cannons' have been halted due to the strike."
    This strike began with the spontaneous action of 1,000 dockworkers at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, and from the outset, it was subjected to persecution and suppression from Ryan, the chairman of the International Longshoremen's Association, to the American military authorities. Ryan blatantly slandered the strike as "illegal" and demanded that the workers return to work by a deadline. The army, on the other hand, repeatedly threatened to send troops to replace the dockworkers. Terminal supervisors, at their wits' end, even directed the notorious gangster boss Tony Anastasio to lead 150 thugs to the docks to forcibly force the workers back to work with violence. However, all these shameless and barbaric tricks not only failed to weaken the striking workers' fighting spirit, but instead aroused even greater anger in them. After persisting in the struggle for five days, the striking workers held another meeting on the 20th and decided to expand the strike into a general strike of all dockworkers in the port of New York, closing all docks that were still open.
    Now, the scope of the strike has expanded from New York to Jersey City and Hoboken in New Jersey. American officials are extremely alarmed by this situation, and they are now planning to deploy troops to take over port operations.

### 纽约码头工人大罢工  严重地瘫痪了到朝鲜等地去的军事运输

    纽约码头工人大罢工
    严重地瘫痪了到朝鲜等地去的军事运输 【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：参加美国劳工联合会所属国际码头工人联合会的纽约码头工人，为抗议该工会领导机构最近和轮船公司签订的不公平的新合同，在十五日自动罢工。这个罢工已严重地瘫痪了从纽约到朝鲜以及其他战争基地去的军事运输与商业运输。到二十一日晚止，罢工人数已超过六千人，纽约布鲁克林，斯退顿岛与曼哈顿三区数百处码头的装卸工作已完全停顿，六十余艘船只因此而被冻结，据路透社称：“载运‘从大豆到大炮’的各种陆军船只均因罢工而停驶。”
    这次罢工是以布鲁克林陆军码头一千码头工人的自发行动开始的，它一开始就受到从国际码头工人联合会主席瑞安到美国军事当局的迫害和镇压。瑞安大肆诬蔑罢工为“非法”，并要求工人限期复工，陆军方面则一再威胁要派军队来代替码头工人工作。码头主管方面穷极无赖，竟指使著名流氓把头汤尼·安纳斯培西亚率领一百五十名打手到码头上去，以暴力强迫工人复工。但是所有这一切无耻与野蛮的伎俩，不仅不能削弱罢工工人的斗争意志，反而激起了他们更大的愤怒。罢工工人在坚持斗争五天以后，又在二十日举行了大会，决定把罢工扩大为纽约全港码头工人的总罢工，封闭一切仍然开放的码头。
    现在，罢工的范围已从纽约扩大至新泽西州的泽西城和豪波肯。美国官方对于这种情势极为惊慌，它们现在正在计划出动军队来接管港口工作。
