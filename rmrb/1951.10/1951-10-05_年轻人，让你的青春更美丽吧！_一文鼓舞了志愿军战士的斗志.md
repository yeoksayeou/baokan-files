    "Young People, Make Your Youth More Beautiful!" Encourages the Fighting Spirit of the Volunteer Soldiers
    Editor:
    The article "Young People, Make Your Youth More Beautiful!" published in the People's Daily on June 16th has given us great education and encouragement. We, these intellectuals who joined the revolutionary ranks during the War of Liberation, have strengthened our revolutionary fighting spirit under the cultivation and education of the Party and superiors. Especially since voluntarily joining the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, we have been constantly encouraged by this great struggle and angered by the disasters and suffering of the Korean people. However, because we have been in a war environment for many years, our youth has been consumed in these years, and some people always have some concerns. Regarding these matters, we have pondered silently in battles, after work, and when seeing some comrades injured, feeling that in war, we would rather sacrifice than be crippled. Some people are always afraid to think about the kind of terrible life they might encounter. This newsletter has indeed enlightened us, helped us dispel this base idea, and given us courage. So we painstakingly borrowed a copy of "How the Steel Was Tempered" and reread it. This book pointed out the glorious direction for us. Everyone wrote Paul's famous quote—"A person's life should be spent in this way, so that when he looks back on the past, he will not regret wasting his years, nor be ashamed of his past mediocrity—so that when he is dying, he can say: 'My whole life and energy have been dedicated to the most magnificent cause in the world!'"—on the front of their diaries as a lifelong oath to serve the revolution. This newsletter, like this quote, constantly encourages our fighting will and moves us forward towards new victories. We, the young people participating in the Korean War of Liberation, are willing to dedicate our youth to this great era of Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea, and dedicate our lives and energy to the most magnificent cause of defending world peace!

### “年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧！”一文鼓舞了志愿军战士的斗志

    “年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧！”一文鼓舞了志愿军战士的斗志编辑同志：
    人民日报六月十六日登载的“年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧！”一文给予我们很大的教育和鼓励。我们这些在祖国解放战争中参加革命队伍的知识分子，在党和上级的培养教育下，坚定了革命的斗志。尤其是自愿参加了抗美援朝志愿军以后，时刻被这伟大的斗争所鼓舞，被朝鲜人民所受的灾害和疾苦所激愤。但是，因为多年来处于战争环境中，青春都消磨在这些年月里，有些人总是有些顾虑。对这些事，我们曾在战斗中，工作后，和看到某些同志负伤的时候，闷着头考虑，觉得在战争中，宁可牺牲也别打残废了。有些人总是不敢去想可能遇到的这种可怕的生活。这篇通讯确实启示了我们，帮助我们打消了这种卑贱的想法，给我们增加了勇气。于是我们就煞费工夫，借到了一本“钢铁是怎样炼成的”重读了一遍。这本书给我们指出了光荣的方向。大家都把保尔那段名言——“一个人的生命应该这样度过，当他回首往事时，他不因虚度年华而悔恨，也不因过去的碌碌无为而羞耻——这样，他在临死的时候能够说：‘我整个生命与精力都已献给世界上最壮丽的事业！’”——记在日记本的前面，做为终身服务革命的誓词。这篇通讯正像这段名言一样，不断地鼓励着我们的战斗意志，向着新的胜利道路前进。我们参加朝鲜解放战争的青年们，愿把青春献给这抗美援朝的伟大年代，把自己的生命和精力献给保卫世界和平的最壮丽的事业！
