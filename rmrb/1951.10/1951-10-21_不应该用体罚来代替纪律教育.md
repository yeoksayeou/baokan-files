    Corporal Punishment Should Not Replace Disciplinary Education
    Seriously training young children in discipline in schools should be an extremely important part of the school's ideological education work. However, cultivating students' qualities of abiding by discipline, or possessing a high degree of cultivation in behavior, cannot be achieved by any crude or barbaric methods. Unfortunately, many elementary school teachers or educators completely fail to understand this point. The "educational" methods they adopt towards children who do not abide by discipline seem to only involve corporal punishment, such as whipping, confinement, ear twisting, and nose scraping. In some schools, if a student asks someone else for a melon to eat, the teacher convenes a struggle session, calling on everyone to beat him. Obviously, this method of managing children is completely contrary to the New Democratic education policy and the spirit of new education. However, according to what we have learned, such incidents continue to occur, which shows that feudal remnants still seriously exist among some of our educators. Therefore, the educational leadership departments in various regions should pay attention to this issue, conduct appropriate inspections, and find some typical cases to educate our comrades. Because this issue is related to the cultivation and growth of our new generation of children.

    不应该用体罚来代替纪律教育
    在学校里认真地对少年儿童进行纪律的训练，应当是学校思想教育工作中极其重要的一环。但，要使学生养成遵守纪律的品性，或具有在行为上的高度教养性，并不是用任何粗暴和野蛮的办法所能达到的。可惜有许多小学教师或教育工作者，完全不懂得这一点，他们对待不遵守纪律的儿童所采取的“教育”办法，仿佛只有体罚。如施行鞭打，禁闭，扭耳朵，刮鼻子；有的学校，因为一个学生向别人要香瓜吃，教师便召集学生开个斗争会，叫大家打他。很明显，这种管理儿童的方式，是与新民主主义教育政策和新教育的精神完全相违背的。但据我们所了解，这类事件仍不断在发生，这说明了，在我们部分教育工作者中间，还严重地存在着封建的残余思想。因此，各地区的教育领导部门，应重视这个问题，适当地进行检查，找出一些典型事例来教育我们的工作同志。因为这个问题关系着我们新一代儿童的教养与成长的问题。
