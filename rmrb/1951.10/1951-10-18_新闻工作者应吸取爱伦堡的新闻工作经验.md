Reader's Letter

    Journalists Should Learn from Ehrenburg's Journalistic Experience
    To the Editor:
    At the symposium with Chinese journalists, Ehrenburg enthusiastically and vividly introduced his writing experience (see the October 12th People's Daily). Ehrenburg's talk is a masterpiece of explaining great principles with "small things." As a journalist, I believe we must study it carefully.
    Ehrenburg said: Newspapers should be made more lively. He asked journalists to think carefully about the things they observe and to work creatively. Some of the articles in our newspapers are very dry and dull, failing to fully and vividly reflect the rich lives of the people. He said that journalists should always think of the readers, should use their brains to make each of their works truly move and educate the readers. He said that a bad journalist often sees not the readers, but the editor-in-chief. I think this is something that is very worthy of our ideological examination. Ehrenburg said that we should strive to use our own language to speak. He ridiculed those journalists who often use some polite—formulaic, vulgar, and rigid language to speak. He advised us to work hard to learn the language of the people to enrich our vocabulary.
    Ehrenburg said that we should strive to write short and clear articles. He said that expressing the greatest amount of emotion with the fewest number of words is the task of a good journalist and writer. Every people's journalist and writer should strive for this. I will remember Ehrenburg's valuable writing experience and apply it to my actual work.

专栏：读者来信

    新闻工作者应吸取爱伦堡的新闻工作经验编辑同志：
    爱伦堡在中国记者座谈会上，热情而生动地介绍了他的写作经验（见十月十二日人民日报）。爱伦堡这个谈话，是以“小事情”说明大道理的杰作，作为一个新闻工作者，我认为必须好好学习它。
    爱伦堡说：应该把报纸办得更生动些。他要求新闻工作者对所观察的事物用心构思和创造性地工作。我们的报纸有些文章就很枯燥，呆板，不能充分生动地反映人民的丰富生活。他说，新闻工作者应该时时刻刻想到读者，应该开动脑筋，使他的每一篇作品能真正地感动读者，教育读者。他说，一个不好的记者所看到的常常不是读者，而是主笔。我认为，这一点是很值得我们从思想上来检查的。爱伦堡说，要努力使用自己的语言来讲话。他嘲笑那些常常用某种彬彬有礼的——公式的，庸俗的，刻板的语言来讲话的新闻记者。他劝告我们，要努力学习人民的语言，来丰富自己的语汇。
    爱伦堡说，应该努力学习写简短明了的文章。他说，以最少的字数表达出最大数量的感情，这是一个好的新闻记者和作家的任务。任何一个人民的新闻工作者和作家都应向此努力。我要好好记住爱伦堡这些宝贵的写作经验，运用到我的实际工作中去。
