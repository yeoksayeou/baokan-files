    The Relationship Between the United Nations Declaration and the Current United Nations
    Question: In Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on August 15 of this year regarding the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference, he mentioned the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, as an example of U.S. and Britain violating international agreements. I wonder if this declaration is the declaration of the international organization "United Nations" currently manipulated by the United States, or what is the relationship between them? Please answer. Reader Wang Ren

    Answer: The United Nations mentioned in the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, and the international organization "United Nations" currently manipulated by the United States, although the names are the same (both in the original English and the Chinese translation), represent two different things in reality. When the United Nations Declaration was issued, there was no United Nations organization yet; the United Nations organization was not established in San Francisco until 1945. Although the United Nations Declaration and the United Nations organization represent different things, there is also a close historical relationship between the two.

    The United Nations Declaration was jointly drafted and issued in Washington on January 1, 1942, by twenty-six Allied countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, who were fighting against the Axis powers. The declaration stated that each country "is engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world," and specifically pointed out: "Each Government undertakes to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies." After the declaration was issued, other countries successively signed it, and by March 1945, the total number of signatory countries reached forty-seven, including Poland and Czechoslovakia. The name "United Nations" for the Allied countries fighting together against the fascist Axis powers was due to the initiative of then-U.S. President Roosevelt, and it was officially used for the first time in this declaration.

    As World War II was coming to an end, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom successively jointly issued the Moscow Conference Communiqué and the Crimea Declaration, "deciding to establish, as soon as possible and with our allies, a general international organization to maintain peace and security." And at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944, it was proposed to establish an international organization, and it was proposed to name it "United Nations." At the San Francisco Conference in 1945, it was formally decided to name the international organization "United Nations." During the discussion of adopting this name at the conference, there were two reasons: (1) It accurately depicts the nature of this international organization that must accomplish common goals; this organization includes people of all faiths and races from all continents, and it is only because of their united efforts that they defeated German and Japanese fascism, and only because of their unity that they provide the possibility of peaceful coexistence after the war. Also, in memory of the late U.S. President Roosevelt, it was decided to continue to use the name he gave and was first used in the United Nations Declaration. (2) The name "United Nations" once referred to the Allied countries fighting against the enemy countries, which has historical connotations and is already well known to the world. At the same time, Article 3 of the United Nations Charter also stipulates: "... or states that have previously signed the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942 ... shall be original members of the United Nations."

    From this, it can be seen that although the United Nations Declaration and the United Nations organization represent two different things, there is a historical development relationship between the two. The United Nations organization, now manipulated by the United States, although it still uses the name of the Allied countries that fought together against the fascist Axis powers, has completely violated the historical tradition and the basic spirit of the United Nations Declaration, and is increasingly reduced to a tool of U.S. aggression.

### 联合国宣言与目前联合国之关系

    联合国宣言与目前联合国之关系
    问：中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长在本年八月十五日发表的关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明中，在斥责美英违背国际协定的举例时，曾提到了一九四二年一月一日的联合国宣言，不知道这个宣言是不是就是现在美国所操纵的国际组织“联合国”的宣言，或者与它有什么关系，请予解答。读者王仁
    答：一九四二年一月一日的联合国宣言所称的联合国，与目前美国所操纵的国际组织“联合国”在名称上（英文原名及我国译名）虽然相同，但实际上所代表的却是两回事。在联合国宣言发表的时候，尚无联合国组织；直到一九四五年联合国组织始在旧金山成立。联合国宣言与联合国组织所代表的虽然不同，但两者之间也相互有密切的历史关系。
    联合国宣言是在一九四二年一月一日，由包括中国、苏联、美国、英国在内的二十六个对法西斯轴心国家作战的同盟国家在华盛顿共同起草发表的。宣言声明各国“对企图征服世界之野蛮与兽性之武力，从事共同奋斗”，并特别指出：“每一政府承允与本宣言签字国合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定与和约。”这一宣言发表后，陆续有其他国家签字，到一九四五年三月止，签字国共计达四十七国，包括波兰、捷克斯洛伐克在内。把共同对法西斯轴心国家作战的同盟国家称之为“联合国”，是由于当时美国总统罗斯福的创议，并在这个宣言上第一次正式采用。
    第二次世界大战行将结束时，苏联、美国、英国曾陆续共同发表莫斯科会议公报、克里米亚声明，“决定尽可能从速和我们的盟邦建立一个一般性的国际组织，以维持和平与安全。”并于一九四四年顿巴敦橡园会议上建议成立国际组织，并拟定名为“联合国”。在一九四五年旧金山会议上，正式决定以“联合国”命名该国际组织。在会议中讨论采用这个名称时，有下面两个理由：（一）确切描绘了这一必须完成共同目的的国际组织性质；这个组织包括各大洲各种信仰各种种族的人民，只是由于他们联合一致的努力，才战胜了德、日法西斯，只是由于他们的联合一致才提供了战后和平共处的可能。又为纪念美国故总统罗斯福，决定沿用他所赋与并曾经第一次用于联合国宣言中的名字。（二）“联合国”这个名称，曾指对敌国作战之同盟国家，具有历史之涵义，且早为世人所共知。同时联合国宪章第三条亦规定：“……或前曾签字于一九四二年一月一日联合国宣言之国家……均为联合国之创始会员国。”
    由此可见，联合国宣言及联合国组织，虽然是代表了两件不同的事情，但两者之间又有着历史的发展关系。现在在美国操纵下的联合国组织，虽然仍沿用着对法西斯轴心国家共同作战的同盟国家的名称，但它已完全违背了历史的传统与联合国宣言的基本精神，而日益沦为美国的侵略工具了。
