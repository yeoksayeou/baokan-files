Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th: According to TASS, on October 7th, Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a speech at the award ceremony for the National Prize, calling on every patriotic scientist, artist, and intellectual in West Germany to support the People's Chamber's proposal to convene an all-German conference.

Pieck pointed out that the awarding of the National Prize this year is taking place under the serious situation facing the German nation. He pointed out: Conspiracies to prepare for war, divide Germany, and remilitarize West Germany are being implemented. In this situation, the labor of West German scientists, researchers, technicians, and engineers is destined to serve the expansion of armaments and war preparations, and achievements in science and technology are destined to serve the cause of human extinction. He emphasized that scientific and technological research results and inventions, art, and literature can benefit mankind, but they can also be a disaster, depending on whether they serve peace or war. Pieck called on all scientists, artists, writers, and intellectuals in West Germany to recognize the great responsibility they bear due to their position in social life, to clearly and bravely voice their appeals to defend the vital interests of the people of the motherland and save the motherland, and to support the People's Chamber's proposal to convene an all-German conference.

Pieck continued: The People's Chamber's proposal has aroused such a strong response from the West German people that Adenauer had to announce to the Bonn parliament that Grotewohl's statement in the People's Chamber and the Federal Government's proposals were gradually approaching each other; however, Adenauer is unwilling to take steps to reach a mutual understanding. He put forward many conditions and spared no effort to use various shameless slanders against the German Democratic Republic to justify these conditions. This is a tactic adopted out of fear of opposition from the West German people. Pieck emphasized that holding an all-German conference and reaching an agreement is possible, and no one has the right to doubt such a possibility. He called on every German patriot to abandon all differences and reach an agreement and achieve a common program on this great goal for the sake of restoring German unity and accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty, because the national interests of the German people demand this.

    皮克号召西德爱国者支持人民议会的建议
    争取恢复德国统一加速缔结和约
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：十月七日，德意志民主共和国总统皮克在颁发国家奖金的盛会上发表演说，号召西德每一个爱国的科学、文艺工作者与知识分子支持人民议会关于召开全德会议的建议。
    皮克指出：今年国家奖金的颁发，是在德意志民族面临着严重的局势的情况下举行的。他指出：为了准备战争，分裂德国和使西德重新军国主义化的阴谋正在实施中，在这种情形下，西德科学家、研究工作者、技师及工程师的劳力就注定要为扩军与备战而服务，科学与技术方面的成就已注定要为灭绝人类的事业而服务了。他强调指出：科学及技术方面的研究成果和发明，艺术和文学，可能为人类造福，但是也可能是祸害，这要看它们为和平服务呢，还是为战争服务。皮克号召西德的全体科学家、艺术家和作家以及全体知识分子，认清由于他们在社会生活中的地位而负担的伟大责任，明确而勇敢地为保卫祖国人民的切身利益和拯救祖国而发出他们的呼声，支持人民议会关于召开全德会议的建议。
    皮克继称：人民议会的建议已经引起了西德人民如此强有力的响应，以至阿登纳不得不向波恩议会宣布：格罗提渥在人民议会中的声明与联邦政府的建议已渐渐接近；但是，阿登纳并不愿意采取步骤以便取得彼此的谅解，他提出了许多条件，并且不惜用各种对德意志民主共和国的无耻诽谤来为这些条件辩解，这是由于害怕西德人民的反对而采取的手腕。皮克强调：举行全德会议并达成协议是可能的，谁也没有权利怀疑这样的可能性，他号召每一个德国的爱国者，为了恢复德国的统一和加速缔结和约，放弃一切歧见，在这个伟大的目标上取得协议和获致一个共同的纲领，因为德国人民的民族利益要求这样做。
