Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd. More than three thousand teachers from twenty universities in Beijing and Tianjin, under the leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, launched a study movement in late September aimed at transforming teachers' ideology and reforming higher education. The participating institutions include Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, Yenching University, Beijing Agricultural University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Northern Jiaotong University, North China University of Technology, Peking Union Medical College, Peking University Medical College, Tianjin University, Nankai University, Tsin沽 University, China Institute of Mining and Technology, Hebei Normal College, Hebei Medical College, Hebei Fisheries College, Foreign Language School, Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the Central Conservatory of Music. The method of study involves listening to reports and reading documents, connecting with one's own thoughts and the situation of the school, and engaging in criticism and self-criticism. The study period is set for four months.

In the past two years, teachers in universities across the country, under the leadership of the educational administrative departments of the People's Government, have engaged in the study of Marxist-Leninist political theory and have gone through the three major movements of resisting America, aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Teachers' political thinking has made considerable progress, and the implementation of education in universities has also undergone some reforms. However, this progress and reform have not kept up with the needs of national construction, nor have they met the demands of students. Although most teachers have been able to accept the general line and policies of New Democracy in terms of the overall political program, they still retain, to varying degrees, remnants of the ideological consciousness of the European and American bourgeoisie in terms of educational thought, academic viewpoints, and work style. The failure to fundamentally transform this kind of thinking and work style, and the failure to implement Marxism-Leninism in higher education work, is the fundamental reason for the slow progress of higher education. Therefore, launching a study movement aimed at transforming ideology among university teachers, and through this study, thoroughly criticizing the above-mentioned erroneous thinking and work styles, and establishing a revolutionary stand, viewpoint, and method, is of great significance for the reform of higher education.

President Ma Yinchu of Peking University, based on his experience in leading the school's staff in a study movement to transform their ideology during the summer vacation this year, proposed extending this study to all teachers in the school. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government believes that this kind of study is necessary in universities across the country, and therefore decided to organize more than three thousand teachers from twenty universities in Beijing and Tianjin to simultaneously conduct the study of transforming ideology, and is preparing to use the experience of Beijing and Tianjin to further widely launch this study movement of transforming ideology in the higher education sector nationwide.

In order to uniformly lead this study movement of teachers in universities in Beijing and Tianjin, the "Beijing-Tianjin University Teachers Study Committee" was established under the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. A "Tianjin General Branch of the Beijing-Tianjin University Teachers Study Committee" was established in Tianjin. Study committee branches were also established in various universities. The chairman of the General Study Committee is Ma Xulun. The vice-chairmen are Qian Junrui and Zeng Zhaolun. The members are: Ma Yinchu, Lin Liru, Chen Yuan, Ye Qisun, Lu Zhiwei, Sun Xiaocun, Mao Yisheng, Yang Shixian, Liu Xiying, Zhang Guofan, Zeng Yi, Hu Chuankui, Li Zongen, Jiang Nanxiang, Liu Ren, Huang Songling, Liu Ziju, Hu Naiqiu, Zhang Zonglin, Zhang Bochuan, Hao Renchu and twenty-one other people. Huang Songling serves as the chairman of the Tianjin General Branch.

In order to enable teachers to have a correct understanding of this study, Premier Zhou Enlai first made a report to the teachers of various schools on September 29th on the issue of the transformation of intellectuals. In his report, Premier Zhou gave a detailed explanation of how intellectuals can acquire a revolutionary stand, viewpoint, and method. Premier Zhou called on teachers in various universities to earnestly engage in criticism and self-criticism, and strive to become revolutionary fighters on the cultural front. Now, the schools are unfolding discussions based on Premier Zhou's report, and many principals and teachers have begun to conduct public self-criticism of their own thoughts.

Regarding the method of criticism and self-criticism, the resolution of the first meeting of the Beijing-Tianjin University Teachers Study Committee pointed out: This study should prevent the dogmatic study method of not connecting with one's own thoughts and not connecting with reality, and on the other hand, it should also prevent piecemeal and trivial technical criticism. Principled political criticism should be implemented in order to improve oneself and help others. In order to unfold criticism and self-criticism and exchange learning experiences, the General Study Committee decided to publish a study newspaper in the near future as a tool to guide this study.

    北京天津两市高等学校教师
    开展学习运动改造思想
    周总理向教师报告知识分子改造问题
    号召努力学习做文化战线的革命战士
    【新华社二十二日讯】北京、天津的二十所高等学校教师三千余人，在中央人民政府教育部的领导下，在九月下旬展开了以改造教师思想、改革高等教育为目的的学习运动。参加这次学习的包括北京大学、清华大学、师范大学、燕京大学、北京农业大学、辅仁大学、北方交通大学、华北大学工学院、协和医学院、北京大学医学院、天津大学、南开大学、津沽大学、中国矿业学院、河北师范学院、河北医学院、河北水产专科学校、外国语学校、中央美术学院、中央音乐学院等二十院校。学习方式是通过听报告和阅读文件，联系本人思想和学校状况，展开批评与自我批评。学习时间定为四个月。
    近两年来，全国高等学校教师在人民政府教育行政部门的领导下，进行了马克思列宁主义的政治理论学习，又经过了抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，教师们的政治思想已有不少的进步，高等学校的教育实施也进行了若干改革。但是这种进步和改革还赶不上国家建设的需要，也落后于学生的要求。多数教师虽然在总的政治纲领上已能接受新民主主义的方针政策，但在教育思想、治学观点、工作作风等方面，还或多或少地保留着欧美资产阶级的思想意识的残余。这一类的思想作风未能得到根本的改造，马克思列宁主义未能在高等教育工作中贯彻，乃是目前高等教育进步缓慢的基本原因。因此，在高等学校教师中开展以改造思想为目的的学习运动，通过这种学习，对上述各种错误的思想作风进行彻底的批判，建立起革命的立场、观点、方法，对于高等教育的改革来说，是有重大意义的。
    北京大学马寅初校长根据他在今年暑假中领导全校职员进行改造思想学习的经验，提议把这种学习推广到全校的教师中去。中央人民政府教育部认为这种学习在全国高等学校中都是必要的，因此决定组织北京天津二十所高等学校的三千多教师，同时进行改造思想的学习，并且准备利用北京、天津的经验，进一步在全国高等教育界普遍展开这个改造思想的学习运动。
    为了统一领导北京天津两市高等学校教师的这一学习运动，在中央人民政府教育部下成立了“京津高等学校教师学习委员会”。并在天津成立了“京津高等学校教师学习委员会天津总分会”。各大学也成立了学习委员会分会。总学习委员会的主任委员为马叙伦。副主任委员为钱俊瑞、曾昭抡。委员：马寅初、林砺儒、陈垣、叶企孙、陆志韦、孙晓村、茅以升、杨石先、刘锡瑛、张国藩、曾毅、胡传揆、李宗恩、蒋南翔、刘仁、黄松龄、刘子久、胡耐秋、张宗麟、张勃川、郝人初等二十一人。天津总分会由黄松龄担任主任委员。
    为了使教师们对这次学习能有正确的认识，九月二十九日首先由周恩来总理向各校教师作了关于知识分子改造问题的报告。周总理在报告中就知识分子如何取得革命立场、观点、方法的问题，作了详尽的说明。周总理号召各高等学校教师认真展开批评和自我批评，努力使自己成为文化战线的革命战士。现在各校正根据周总理的报告展开讨论，许多校长和教师已开始对自己的思想进行了公开的自我批评。
    关于批评和自我批评的方法，北京天津高等学校教师学习委员会第一次会议的决议指出：这次学习要防止不联系自己思想、不联系实际的教条主义学习方法，另一方面也要防止零星琐碎的技术批评。应实行有原则性的政治批评，才能提高自己帮助别人。为了展开批评和自我批评，交流学习的经验，总学委决定在最近出版一种学习报，作为领导这次学习的工具。
