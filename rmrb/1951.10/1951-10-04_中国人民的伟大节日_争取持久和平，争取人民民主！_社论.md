The first of October is the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. All progressive humanity will celebrate with the great Chinese people the historic victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution over the combined forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism.

The victory of the Chinese people's liberation movement dealt an extremely heavy blow to the entire world imperialist system. This system lost its largest colony and dependency - China, a country with a quarter of the world's population. As a result, the balance of power between the two camps in the world has further shifted in favor of the anti-imperialist camp, which is headed by the Soviet Union and is fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism. For many years, China had been arbitrarily plundered by imperialist bandits, Chinese feudal landlords, and comprador bourgeoisie. American, British, French, Japanese, and German imperialists divided China as a whole into "spheres of influence"; they used a robber's iron rod to plunder China's wealth, but called it the "Open Door" policy; they divided the spoils according to the balance of power between them, but called it "equal opportunity."

The Chinese people have waged irreconcilable and heroic struggles against their oppressors. Under the impetus of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, which shook the old roots of imperialism in colonial and dependent countries, the Chinese people's liberation movement rose to a new and higher stage. The Communist Party of China was founded. It combined the Chinese people's revolutionary movement with the scientific theory of socialism.

Under the leadership of its long-tested leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, the glorious Communist Party of China guided the Chinese people through the bourgeois democratic revolution from 1925 to 1927, the ten-year civil war from 1927 to 1936, and the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945, and established people's power - worker-peasant power - in many parts of the country. The Soviet Union's historic victory in World War II, the defeat of Hitler's Germany and militarist Japan, and the establishment of people's democratic systems in some European countries were important international factors that helped the Chinese liberation movement achieve complete victory.

Mao Zedong wrote: "If there had been no Soviet Union, if there had been no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, if Japanese imperialism had not been defeated, if no new democratic countries had emerged... then the international reactionary forces piled on top of us would certainly have been many times greater than they are now. In such circumstances, could we have won? Obviously not."

After the end of World War II, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique immediately concluded a criminal agreement with the American imperialists in an attempt to crush the Chinese people's liberation movement. At the cost of betraying the motherland, the Kuomintang clique obtained from the US government thousands of aircraft, tens of thousands of artillery pieces and tanks, hundreds of thousands of machine guns, and other military equipment worth a total of six billion US dollars, and in the summer of 1946 launched a bloody war against the people who had already established a truly democratic regime in the liberated areas.

The Communist Party of China united the people and waged a great war of liberation. Tempered in battle, the Communist Party of China used Marxist-Leninist theory as a weapon and mastered the correct method for solving the Chinese anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary problems.

Under the banner of the Communist Party, the revolutionary leader - the proletariat - stood in close ranks; its close allies - the broad masses of peasants; and the patriotic elements of the bourgeoisie. Millions of glorious People's Liberation Army soldiers are defending the fruits of the revolution. The sympathy and assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the fraternal solidarity of the oppressed and exploited masses of the East and West, and all honest people around the world are on the side of the Chinese working people's just cause.

Although the Kuomintang army initially outnumbered the People's Liberation Army by as much as three to one and had an absolute advantage in military technology, it was finally decisively defeated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the entire Chinese mainland was liberated.

The founding of the People's Republic marked a new era in Chinese history. For the first time, the Chinese people took state power into their own hands, established a people's democratic dictatorship, and through the Communist Party and the People's Government, solemnly declared that they would build a new life and create a free and truly independent people's democratic country. The Communist Party of China has opened the road to socialism for the Chinese people.

The People's Republic of China inherited a pitiful legacy from the corrupt and traitorous Kuomintang regime. Industry had been almost completely destroyed, mines were flooded, railways were damaged and impassable, and agriculture was in decline. Millions of people were starving.

However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people, united in the People's Democratic United Front, found the strength to overcome the terrible economic devastation and carry out fundamental political and economic transformations. Opposition to American imperialist aggression, opposition to feudal reactionary forces, striving for national independence, and carrying out extensive democratic reforms - these ideas took root in the hearts of the masses and became a powerful material force. The people's regime drove out the imperialist saboteurs, confiscated the industrial, transportation, and banking assets of the big comprador bourgeoisie and nationalized them, abolished the feudal land ownership system, and then called on millions of ordinary people to engage in production and construction to create the necessary conditions for rapidly improving the welfare of the working people.

The great land reform has now been extended to varying degrees to all parts of this vast country, forever abolishing the feudal dependence of peasants that has existed for thousands of years, abolishing the landlord class, and giving the land to those who till it. More than 75 percent of peasant households have already received land from landlords. Agriculture is now advancing along the road to prosperity. The necessary conditions are now being created to transform a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country.

The work of industrialization is being carried out victoriously on the basis of the rapidly developing state-owned industry. In 1950, China's pig iron production increased to 11.4 times that of 1949; steel production increased to 7.8 times; and the production of various machines increased more than threefold! The number of employed urban residents is increasing rapidly. The labor productivity of workers is also increasing as they apply Soviet experience, use new technical equipment, and improve technical processes.

Previously, 90 percent of China's population could not read or write. Today, a real cultural revolution is underway. The people are thirsty for knowledge and learning. The Republic now has hundreds of thousands of elementary schools, middle schools, and universities, with tens of millions of children of workers and peasants enrolled.

The victories and achievements of the People's Republic of China clearly demonstrate how much can be achieved by a people liberated from the yoke of oppressors; they also demonstrate the strong vitality of the people's regime.

In all their revolutionary transformations, the Chinese people have relied on the selfless and friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and the strong support of the Chinese people's great friend, J.V. Stalin. The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, signed on February 14, 1950, and the subsequent economic agreements, have forever cemented the fraternal ties between the two great peoples. The Chinese working people warmly accept the Soviet Union's economic and cultural assistance and draw on Soviet technical experience, which has promoted the rapid recovery and further development of Chinese industry and agriculture. The Chinese people are fighting for peace and creative labor. More than 344 million Chinese citizens have expressed their support for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. However, the Chinese people's desire for peace is threatened by American imperialism. The US aggression against Korea nakedly exposes the Truman government's predatory plans against People's China. The United States has occupied China's Taiwan Island and turned it into a war base. The United States is trying its best to exert political and economic pressure on the People's Republic of China and prevent it from obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations. Under the dictatorial actions of the United States, the separate peace treaty with Japan, which is used to revive Japanese militarism and prepare for another war of aggression in Asia, has been rubber-stamped at the San Francisco conference. However, no provocation or hostile act by the American warmongers can reverse the wheels of history. The Chinese people have given the imperialist conspiracies the response they deserve. They are standing in the united camp of peace-loving people of all countries, defending the fruits of their revolution, and defending the cause of world peace.

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, peace-loving people extend their heartfelt congratulations to the great Chinese people, the People's Government, and the heroic Communist Party of China, and wish them further success in the struggle for peace and the cause of building a new life.

    中国人民的伟大节日
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”社论
    十月一日是中华人民共和国成立两周年纪念日。全体进步人类将和伟大的中国人民一道庆祝中国人民民主革命击败国民党反动派和美帝国主义的联合力量的历史性胜利。
    中国人民解放运动的胜利，使整个世界帝国主义体系受到极其沉重的打击。这个体系失去了最大的一个殖民地和附属国——中国，这个拥有全世界人口四分之一的国家。由此世界上两个阵营的力量对比进一步发生了有利于反帝国主义阵营的变化，这个以苏联为首的阵营正在为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争。多年以来，中国曾受到帝国主义强盗、中国封建地主和大买办资产阶级的任意掠夺。美、英、法、日、德帝国主义者曾把中国这个整体分割成“势力范围”；他们带着一根强盗用的铁棍来掠夺中国的财富，却把它叫做“门户开放”政策；他们按照他们之间的力量对比进行分赃的勾当，却把它说成是“机会均等”。
    中国人民曾对他们的压迫者进行不调和的英勇斗争。在震撼了帝国主义在殖民地国家和附属国家的老根的俄国伟大十月社会主义革命的激荡下，中国人民解放运动上升到一个新的更高的阶段。中国共产党成立了。它使中国人民的革命运动和科学的社会主义理论结合起来。
    光荣的中国共产党在它的久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，引导中国人民经过了一九二五年到一九二七年的资产阶级民主革命、一九二七年到一九三六年的十年内战和一九三七年到一九四五年的八年抗日战争，并在国内许多地区建立了人民政权——工农政权。苏联在第二次世界大战中的历史性的胜利，希特勒德国和军国主义日本的败北，以及人民民主制度在欧洲一些国家中的建立，是一个有助于中国解放运动获得完全胜利的重要国际因素。
    毛泽东写道：“假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现……，那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。”
    在第二次世界大战结束以后，反动的蒋介石集团立即与美帝国主义者订立了罪恶的协定，要想粉碎中国人民的解放运动。国民党集团以出卖祖国为代价，得到美国政府共值六十亿美元的数千架飞机、数万大炮和坦克，数十万挺机关枪及其他军事装备，并于一九四六年夏天向已经在解放区建立了真正民主政权的人民发动了血腥的战争。
    中国共产党团结人民，进行伟大的解放战争。在战斗中百炼成钢的中国共产党以马列主义理论为武器，掌握了正确解决中国反帝、反封建的革命问题的方法。
    在共产党的旗帜下，在紧密的队伍中站着革命的领导者——无产阶级；它的亲密的同盟者——广大的农民群众；以及资产阶级中的爱国阶层。数百万光荣的人民解放军在保卫着革命的果实。苏联和人民民主国家的同情与援助，东方与西方被压迫被剥削群众以及全世界一切正直人民的兄弟般的声援，都是在中国劳动人民的正义事业一边的。
    尽管国民党军队初起在人数上大到三倍，而在军事技术方面也占着绝对优势，但终于遭到了中国人民解放军的决定性的击败，整个中国大陆获得了解放。
    人民共和国的宣告成立，在中国历史上揭开了一个新纪元。中国人民第一次把国家政权掌握到自己的手里，建立了人民民主专政，并经由共产党和人民政府，庄严地宣告他们要建设新的生活，创造一个自由、真正独立的人民民主国家。中国共产党为中国人民开辟了走向社会主义的道路。
    中华人民共和国所继承的，是从腐朽透顶的国民党卖国贪污的旧政权所留下的一份可怜的遗产。工业差不多已被全部破坏，矿坑被灌满了水，铁路被破坏得不能通车，农业凋敝。千千万万的人民嗷嗷待哺。
    但是，中国人民在共产党领导之下团结在人民民主统一战线内，找到了力量来克服可怕的经济残破状态，实行根本的政治经济改造。反对美帝国主义侵略，反对封建反动势力，争取民族独立和进行广泛的民主改革——这种思想在群众的心中生了根，成为一种强大的物质力量。人民政权赶走了帝国主义破坏分子，没收大买办资产阶级的工业、运输业和银行归国家所有，并废除了封建土地所有制，接着又号召千千万万的普通人民从事生产建设，为迅速增进劳动人民的福利创造必要的条件。
    伟大的土地改革现在已在各种不同的程度上扩展到这个广大国家的各个地方，永远废除存在了几千年的农民的封建依赖制度，废除地主这一个阶级，把土地交给耕种土地的人。百分之七十五以上的农户已经得到了地主的土地。农业现在正沿着繁荣的大道向前迈进。现在正在创造必要的条件，把落后的农业国家变成一个工业——农业国家。
    工业化的工作正在迅速发展着的国营工业的基础上胜利地进行着。在一九五○年，中国的生铁产量增加到了一九四九年的十一点四倍；钢的产量增加到七点八倍；各种机器的产量增加到三倍以上！城市居民的就业人数正在迅速增加。工人的劳动生产率也在提高，他们应用苏联的经验，使用新的技术设备，并且使技术过程日趋完善。
    在以前，中国的人口有百分之九十不能读书写字。今天，一个真正的文化革命正在进行中。人民渴求着知识与学问。这个共和国现在已有数十万所小学、中学与高等学校，入学的有数千万工农子弟。
    中华人民共和国的胜利与成就显著地证明了从压迫者奴役下解放出来的人民能够取得多么大的成就；也证明了人民政权有着怎样强有力的生命力。
    中国人民在他们的一切革命的改造过程中，是有着苏联无私的友好援助，有着中国人民伟大的朋友——约·维·斯大林的强有力的支持作为依靠的。苏联和中华人民共和国在一九五○年二月十四日签订的友好同盟互助条约，以及后来签订的经济协定，把两国伟大人民兄弟般的联系永远固定下来了。中国劳动人民热情地接受苏联的经济与文化援助，吸取苏联的技术经验，这种援助与经验促进了中国工业与农业的迅速恢复和进一步发展。中国人民正在为和平与从事创造性的劳动而奋斗。中国已有三亿四千四百多万公民表示拥护五大国缔结和平公约。但是，中国人民的和平愿望受到了美帝国主义的威胁。美国侵略朝鲜的行动赤裸裸地暴露了杜鲁门政府对人民中国的掠夺计划。美国占领了中国的台湾岛，把它变成了战争基地。美国竭力在政治与经济上对中华人民共和国施加压力，阻挠它在联合国组织中取得它的合法的地位。在美国的专断下，用以复活日本军国主义和准备另一次亚洲侵略战争的单独对日“和约”，已在旧金山会议上盖上了橡皮图章。但是，美国战争贩子的任何挑衅和敌对行为，都不能扭转历史的车轮。中国人民给了帝国主义的阴谋以应有的反击。他们正站在各国爱好和平的人民的统一阵营中，保卫他们的革命果实，保卫世界和平事业。
    值此中华人民共和国成立二周年，爱好和平的人民向伟大的中国人民、向人民政府、向英雄的中国共产党，致以衷心的贺忱，并祝他们在争取和平的斗争与建设新生活的事业中获得进一步的成功。
