    The Creative Spirit of the Working Class Shattered My Pro-American Ideology
    To the Editor:
    I received great inspiration and education after visiting the Southwest China Industrial Exhibition on October 4th. I am a technician who used to worship the technology of countries like Britain and the United States, believing that anything foreign was good. I adopted a disdainful attitude towards domestic products. As soon as I saw a machine part made in China, I would shake my head and even feel wronged to even look at it. Therefore, when I went to visit the exhibition, I was just "looking for some fun." However, the rich content of the exhibition corrected my wrong thinking.
    The first thing that caught my attention was the spinning frame produced by Chongqing No. 201 Factory. When the explainer pointed out that the machine could produce twelve taels of fine yarn in eight hours, exceeding the output of American-made spinning frames, my pro-American ideology began to waver. Then, I saw our self-made 55-horsepower diesel engine. At this point, I was no longer disappointed with China's industry. When I saw the surface grinder produced by Chongqing No. 497 Factory, whose efficiency exceeded international standards by five times, my pro-American ideology was completely bankrupt. Now, I have realized that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the creative spirit of the working class, any difficulties can be overcome.

### 工人阶级的创造精神打破了我的崇美思想

    工人阶级的创造精神打破了我的崇美思想编辑同志：
    我于十月四日参观了西南区工业展览会后，得到了很大的启发和教育。我是一个技术人员，过去一直崇拜英美等国的技术，认为只要是外国货都是好的。对于国产品则采取鄙视的态度，只要一看到中国制造的机器零件，就摇头，甚至看一下都觉得有些委屈。因此，当我去参观的时候，不过是想“瞧瞧热闹”而已。但是，展览会的丰富内容纠正了我的错误思想。
    第一件引起我注意的是重庆二○一厂出品的细纱机，当说明员指出该机在八小时内能出产细纱十二两，已超过美制细纱机的产量后，我的崇美思想开始起了动摇。接着，我又看到了我们自制的五十五匹马力的柴油机，这时，我对中国的工业，已不表示失望了。等到我看到重庆四九七厂出品的平面磨床，其效率已超过国际标准五倍时，我的崇美思想就彻底破产了。现在，我已认识到，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，加上工人阶级的创造精神，任何困难都是可以克服的。
