    The Semi-Colonial Nature of Foreign Trade in the Past Has Been Fundamentally Changed
    Since the Founding of the Country, China's Foreign Trade Has Achieved Trade Surpluses Year After Year
    Since the founding of the country, China's foreign trade has fundamentally changed its semi-colonial nature over the past two years, powerfully guaranteeing the restoration and development of the domestic economy.

    Over the past two years, due to the implementation of controls on foreign trade and policies to protect trade, China's foreign trade has begun to experience trade surpluses, something unseen for seventy-three years. In 1950, the surplus accounted for 9.34% of the total import and export value. In 1951, China further adopted the policy of expanding trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries in its foreign trade. It successively signed trade agreements with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Democratic Germany, and North Korea. At the same time, it implemented a barter policy of "import first, export later" for trade with capitalist countries. China's economic dependence on imperialist countries has fundamentally changed since then. In terms of the countries from which China imported goods, in 1950, imports from the Soviet Union accounted for 19.84% of China's total imports, imports from People's Democratic Countries accounted for only 1.37% of the total imports, and imports from capitalist countries accounted for 78.79% of the total imports. As of now in 1951, the value of goods imported from the Soviet Union has increased to account for 44.7% of the total imports, the value of goods imported from People's Democratic Countries has increased to account for 25.3% of the total imports, and the value of goods imported from capitalist countries has decreased to account for only 29.9% of the total imports. In terms of export trade, in 1950, exports to the Soviet Union accounted for only 26.58% of the total exports, exports to People's Democratic Countries accounted for 3.87% of the total exports, and exports to capitalist countries accounted for 69.55% of the total exports. As of now in 1951, the value of goods exported to the Soviet Union has surged to account for 51.51% of the total exports, the value of goods exported to People's Democratic Countries has surged to account for 26.43% of the total exports, and the value of goods exported to capitalist countries has decreased to account for only 22% of the total exports. Due to the rapid expansion of trade with the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries, as of now, China's export trade volume in 1951 has increased by 126% compared to 1950.

    Thanks to the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and the rapid development of equal and mutually beneficial trade between the People's Democratic Countries and China, China has been able to import a large number of industrial equipment, industrial raw materials, and transportation equipment from the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries; these materials accounted for more than 97% of the total transaction value in the 1950 Sino-Soviet trade contract. The prices of both goods exported from China to the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries and goods imported from the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries are based on the prices in the 1950 trade agreement, shaking off the impact of rising prices in the world capitalist market due to war preparations.

    China mainly exports agricultural and sideline products to the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries. Compared with 1950, the variety and quantity of goods exported from China to the Soviet Union and other countries have greatly increased in 1951. Many native products that had never been exported to the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries in the past have also found sales channels in these countries this year, and the sales volume of some commodities has even reached the maximum amount that China can currently export.

    The great achievements of China's foreign trade in the past two years are a heavy blow to the imperialist countries' conspiracy of economic "blockade" and "embargo" against China. Take the United States as an example. This September, the prices of goods such as pig bristles and tung oil in the US market have risen by more than 50% compared to last November. The imperialists' economic "blockade" against China has clearly backfired. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 过去对外贸易的半殖民地性质根本改变了  开国以来我国对外贸易连年出超

    过去对外贸易的半殖民地性质根本改变了
    开国以来我国对外贸易连年出超
    我国对外贸易自开国两年来已经根本改变了过去的半殖民地性质，有力地保障了国内经济的恢复和发展。
    两年来，由于实行了对外贸易的管制和保护贸易的政策，我国对外贸易中开始出现了七十三年来所没有过的出超情况。一九五○年出超额占进出口总值百分之九点三四。一九五一年我国在对外贸易方面更进一步地采取了扩大对苏联和人民民主国家贸易的方针，先后和苏联、捷克、匈牙利、波兰、民主德国、朝鲜等国签订了贸易协定。同时，对于资本主义国家的贸易，实行了先进后出的易货政策。我国经济对于帝国主义国家的依赖性从此根本改变。在我国进口贸易的国别方面，一九五零年我国由苏联进口货物占我国总进口额百分之十九点八四，由人民民主国家进口货物仅占总进口额的百分之一点三七，由资本主义国家进口货物占总进口额的百分之七十八点七九。一九五一年截至目前止，我国由苏联进口货额增到占总进口额的百分之四十四点七，由人民民主国家进口的货物增加到占总额的百分之二十五点三，由资本主义国家进口的货物下降到只占总进口额的百分之二十九点九。出口贸易方面，一九五零年，我国向苏联出口的货物仅占总出口额的百分之二十六点五八，对人民民主国家出口的货物占总出口额的百分之三点八七，对资本主义国家出口的货物占总出口额的百分之六十九点五五。一九五一年截至目前止，我国对苏联出口货额激增到占总出口额的百分之五十一点五一，对人民民主国家出口货额激增到占总出口额的百分之二十六点四三，对资本主义国家出口货额下降到只占总出口额的百分之二十二。由于对苏联和人民民主国家贸易的迅速扩大，到目前为止，一九五一年我国出口贸易额已比一九五零年增加百分之一百二十六。
    由于苏联的友谊援助，人民民主国家和我国之间平等互惠的贸易迅速发展，我国得以从苏联和人民民主国家输入了大批工业设备、工业原料及交通器材等；这些物资在一九五○年中苏贸易合同中占了总交易额的百分之九十七以上。在我国向苏联及人民民主国家出口物资及由苏联及人民民主国家进口物资的价格上，都根据一九五○年贸易协定的价格为基础，摆脱了世界资本主义市场由于备战而造成的物价上涨的影响。
    我国向苏联和人民民主国家出口的主要是农业、副业产品。以一九五一年和一九五零年相比，我国对苏联等国出口货品种和数量都大为增加。许多过去从来没有向苏联和人民民主国家输出过的土产品，今年也在这些国家找到了销路，其中有些商品的销量且已达到我国目前可能出口的最高量。
    我国对外贸易两年来的巨大成就，是我国人民对于帝国主义国家对我经济“封锁”、“禁运”阴谋的沉重一击。拿美国来说，今年九月份美国市场猪鬃、桐油等货价格都比去年十一月份高涨百分之五十以上。帝国主义对我经济“封锁”显然已经自食恶果。      （新华社）
