    "I Have Dedicated My Whole Life to the Party"
    ——In Memory of Model Party Member Zhang Lin
    What can a blind person do? How can they live? Here is a Communist Party member – Zhang Lin, the Deputy Director of the Personnel Assistance Bureau of the China Changchun Railway Administration, who was selected as a national railway labor model representative this time, can answer this question with his vivid struggle.
    Zhang Lin's eyes were injured by armed bandits of the landlord class. In 1945, Zhang Lin was a political commissar in a detachment, fighting against the landlord's armed forces in the area south of the Songhua River in eastern Harbin. In one battle, a wicked bullet pierced his temple, and he lost his sight. This was a heavy blow. Zhang Lin once considered how he would work in the future. But when he heard the news that his old comrade-in-arms General Li Zhaolin had been murdered by special agents, the flames of revenge immediately ignited. From that day on, he got out of bed and practiced walking. He longed to work: "If I don't die, I will work!" During his convalescence in the hospital, this man with white bandages covering his eyes went out to work every day. Whenever his work was successful, he was very happy: "This blind man is not completely useless." In May 1946, he led a work team to carry out land reform work in the eastern Harbin area. At this time, he had not fully recovered his health, and the environment was quite difficult. Zhang Lin lived in a poor peasant's home, ate corn porridge, and slept on bean stalks. Soon he fell ill, but he continued to work. In twenty days, he interviewed more than ninety poor and hired peasants, and then asked his comrades to help him compile an article entitled "The Forms of Feudal Exploitation in the Northeast Countryside". This article promoted the land reform movement in several regions of the Northeast. When he overcame his illness again and the land reform work came to an end, he compiled a booklet: "Some Issues to Be Noted in Leading a Land Reform Work Team". Later, this article was printed and distributed by the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and became study material for cadres.
    In December 1946, Zhang Lin went to Moscow for recuperation. The Ostrovsky Museum happened to be near the hospital where he was staying. When Ostrovsky's wife learned that an excellent son of the Chinese Communist Party, who was blind, was living here, she made a special trip to visit him and told him the story of the strong-willed Ostrovsky. This was a heroic example, and Zhang Lin gained more revolutionary optimism, spirit and strength from him. After returning to China, his work performance was even more outstanding.
    For eighteen years, Zhang Lin has worked selflessly for the Party, and there are many model deeds that cannot be written out one by one. What is mentioned here are just some model examples of his work in the China Changchun Railway Administration after he became blind.
    Zhang Lin was the first to introduce the Soviet new shunting method to our country and promote it. The implementation of the new shunting method in the China Changchun Railway Administration alone can save the country more than one hundred billion yuan per year.
    Zhang Lin advocated the piece-rate wage system. The benefits it brought to the country can be exemplified by the production situation of the Harbin Vehicle Inspection Section: In the past, it took forty-four and a half hours for this vehicle inspection section to perform a Class A inspection on a car. After the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, it only takes twenty-four hours. It took five hours to inspect a Class B or C car, and after the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, it only takes a little more than two hours. If calculated based on 7,000 Class A inspections and 100,000 Class B and C inspections per year, 374,920 work hours can be saved.
    Zhang Lin also introduced and promoted the Kovalev work method. Now, this advanced work method is being promoted throughout the country. Other methods, such as the examination system, staffing methods, the flag loading method, the Mamitov dedicated line car delivery method, and the Nefidov new road maintenance method, were all promoted in the China Changchun Railway under Zhang Lin's leadership or organization and have been followed by various places.
    How much great work has a blind person done for the country! Why can he create such miracles?
    This is because he has a firm communist world outlook, and he can work and study diligently and tenaciously. These days, I often think of what he once said to me: "The Party has nurtured me for seventeen or eighteen years, and my wings have just begun to harden a little, and my eyes have become blind! This is painful for myself, but when I think that I can't do more work for the Party, I feel even more pain! I am determined to give my whole life to the Party and do as much work as I can for the Party." I clearly remember that when I went to see him that day, he was reading Aranayev's novel "Far From Moscow" in Russian under the lamp with a Soviet-made 75x blood test microscope. He could only see one Russian letter as big as a plate at a time. He had to read several letters to form a single word before he understood the meaning of the word. He told me that the article about the Kovalev work method in "The Steam Whistle" was read on the train using this microscope. Now, he reads in this way, and it takes two or three hours to read a page.
    Zhang Lin is such a person. This should be an example for everyone, every Communist Party member.

### “我把整个生命交给了党”——记模范党员张林

    “我把整个生命交给了党”
    ——记模范党员张林
    一个双目失明的人，能做什么事情？怎样生活？这里有一个共产党员——这次被选为全国铁路劳动模范代表的中长铁路管理局人事助理局长张林，可以用他自己生动的斗争事迹来回答这个问题。
    张林的眼睛是被地主的武装匪徒打坏的。一九四五年，张林是一个支队里的政治委员，在哈尔滨东部松花江南岸一带和地主武装作战。在一次战斗中，他被一颗罪恶的子弹打穿了太阳穴，两眼就此失明了。这个打击是很重的，张林曾经考虑到以后怎样工作的问题。但当他听到他的老战友李兆麟将军被特务杀害的消息后，复仇的火焰立刻燃烧起来。从这一天起，他下床炼习走路。他渴望着工作：“如果我不死，我就工作！”在医院休养期间，这个两眼上蒙着白色绷带的人，每天跑出去工作。每逢工作有成绩时，他就非常快乐：“我这个瞎子，还不是没有一点用处的。”一九四六年五月，他带领了一个工作团，在哈东地区做土地改革工作。这时，他并没有完全恢复健康，环境又相当艰苦，张林住在一个贫农家里，吃苞米楂子，睡在豆秸上。不久他病倒了，但还是继续工作。在二十天里他和九十多个贫农、雇农作了谈话，然后请同志们帮助他整理出《东北农村中的封建剥削形式》一文。这篇文章对东北若干地区的土地改革运动起了推动作用。等他再一次战胜疾病，土地改革工作告一段落时，他又整理出一本小册子：“领导土地改革工作团应注意的一些问题”。后来，这篇文章经中共中央东北局印发，成为干部学习材料。
    一九四六年十二月间，张林到莫斯科休养。奥斯特洛夫斯基博物馆恰好在他住的医院附近。奥斯特洛夫斯基夫人知道了有一个双目失明的中国共产党的优秀儿子住在这里，她特地来看望他。给他讲述具有坚强意志的奥斯特洛夫斯基的故事。这是一个英雄的榜样，张林从他获得了更多的革命的乐观主义的精神和力量。回国以后，他表现的工作成绩更卓越了。
    十八年来，张林忘我地为党工作，模范事迹很多，不可能一一写出来，这里所提到的，只是他从双目失明后在中长铁路管理局工作中的一些模范事例。
    张林第一个把苏联新调车法介绍到我国来，并加以推广。仅在中长铁路局管内实行新调车法的结果，每年可为国家节省一千余亿元。
    张林提倡计件工资制度，所给国家带来的利益，可以举哈尔滨检车段的生产情况为例：过去，这个检车段甲检一辆车，需四十四个半小时，实行计件工资制后仅需二十四小时。乙丙检一辆车需五小时，施行计件工资制后仅需二小时多些。如按全年甲检七千辆、乙丙检十万辆计算，就可以节省三十七万四千九百二十工时。
    张林又介绍和推广了郭瓦廖夫工作方法。现在，这一先进的工作方法，正在向全国推广。其他如考工制度、定员方法、对旗装车法、马密铎夫专用线取送车法、聂菲铎夫新养路方法等等，都是在张林的领导或组织之下在中长铁路推广起来的，并为各地所效法。
    一个双目失明的人，为国家做了多少巨大的工作啊！为什么他能创造这样的奇迹呢？
    这是因为他具有坚定的共产主义人生观，他能够刻苦、顽强地工作和学习。这几天我常常想起他曾对我说过的话：“党培养了我十七八年，翅膀刚刚长硬了一点儿，眼睛就瞎了！这对自己是痛苦的，但一想到我不能为党多做些工作，觉得痛苦更大！我决心把我整个生命交出来，能为党做多少工作就做多少。”我清楚地记得，那天我去看他的时候，他正在灯下用苏联制七十五倍的验血用显微镜读着俄文的阿然耶夫的小说《远离莫斯科》。他一下只能看见像盘子一般大的一个俄文字母，他看完好几个字母拼成一个单字才懂得这个字的意思。他告诉我，《汽笛报》上那篇关于郭瓦廖夫工作方法的文章，是坐在火车上，用这个显微镜看完的。现在，他用这种方法读书，两三个小时可以读一页。
    张林，就是这样的人。这应该是每个人、每个共产党员的榜样。
