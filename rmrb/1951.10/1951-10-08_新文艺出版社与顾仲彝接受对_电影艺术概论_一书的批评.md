Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    New Literature and Art Publishing House and Gu Zhongyi
    Accept Criticism of the Book "Introduction to Film Art"

    To the Editors:
    The article by Comrade Li Qing in the "Cultural Life" column of the People's Daily on August 30 criticizing the book "Introduction to Film Art" (written by Gu Zhongyi), published by Qunyi Publishing House, was completely agreed with by us, and we express our gratitude. Indeed, as Comrade Li Qing said, this book made errors of principle. We have conducted a review and now inform you of the results of our review.

    This book was a manuscript agreed upon in Hong Kong before liberation. When accepting this manuscript, we did not pay attention to checking the content of the manuscript, with the result that we published a book that worshipped the decadent film art of Britain and the United States. This year, during the preparation for the establishment of the New Literature and Art Publishing House by Qunyi, Haiyan, and Dafu Publishing Houses, the book was hastily reprinted under the name of "Qunyi" Publishing House because it had been out of stock for a long time. Before reprinting, we consulted the author as to whether revisions were needed. The author informed us in a letter that revisions were not needed for the time being, so we did not re-examine it and reprinted it again. Our publishing house is still in the preparatory stage of reorganization, and our organization is not yet sound. Although this is one of the reasons for this error, the fundamental problem is that we did not treat publications with a highly responsible spirit. We must immediately correct this irresponsible style. In order to implement the spirit of this publishing administration conference, we are now preparing to conduct a preliminary review of the content of all publications previously owned by the three publishing houses.

    Attached: Letter from Gu Zhongyi to New Literature and Art Publishing House

    New Literature and Art Publishing House:
    I have read Comrade Li Qing's criticism. The errors he pointed out are completely correct. I wrote this book in Hong Kong in 1948. At that time, I had seen very few Soviet films and did not understand them well enough, so the examples I cited were full of British and American films. Last year I wanted to revise it before reprinting, but I was delayed due to busy affairs. Now I am determined to rewrite it, and I expect to complete it within a year. Recently, I plan to write a summary of my study of "The Life of Wu Xun," which will mention the erroneous views of this book, so I do not intend to write a separate self-criticism.
                                    Gu Zhongyi

### 新文艺出版社与顾仲彝接受对“电影艺术概论”一书的批评

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    新文艺出版社与顾仲彝
    接受对“电影艺术概论”一书的批评编辑同志：
    八月三十日人民日报“文化生活”栏内登了李青同志批评群益出版社出版的“电影艺术概论”（顾仲彝著）一书的文章；我们完全同意这个批评，并表示感谢。的确如李青同志所说，这本书犯了原则性的错误。我们进行了检讨，现将检讨结果告诉你们。
    这本书是解放前在香港约定的稿子，在接受这部稿子时，没有注意检查该稿的内容，以致把这一部崇拜英美腐朽电影艺术的书也出版了。今年群益、海燕、大孚三家出版社在筹组新文艺出版社期间，因该书售缺已久，就匆促地用“群益”出版社的名义重印了一次。在重印前，我们曾征询作者是否需要修改，作者函告暂时不需要修改，因此我们就没有重新审查，又把它重印出来了。本社尚在筹备改组期间，一切组织尚不健全，这虽是造成这种错误的一个原因，但根本的问题是我们没有以高度负责的精神，严肃地对待出版物的结果。这种不负责任的作风，我们要立即加以纠正。我们为了贯彻本届出版行政会议的精神，现正准备将以前三家所有的出版物的内容作一次初步的审查。
                        上海新文艺出版社
    附：顾仲彝给新文艺出版社的信新文艺出版社：
    李青同志的批评，我已读过了。他所指出的错误，完全是正确的。这本书是我一九四八年在香港写的，当时苏联电影我看得很少，了解得也不够，所以举例引证，满脑子都是英美电影。去年我就想修改后再版，但因事务繁忙，延搁至今。现在我决心把它重写，预计一年内完成。最近我拟写一篇我学习“武训传”的小结，将提到这本书的错误观点，故不拟另写检讨了。
