    The literary, art, education, and science workers, as well as the broad masses of young students throughout the country, have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea. Teachers and students in schools across various regions have enthusiastically participated in the propaganda and education work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea. In Cha’har Province, over ten thousand educators, during the popularization campaign of Resisting America and Aiding Korea around "May Day" this year, led all the students to conduct patriotic propaganda to 1.9 million people (nearly half of the province's population) in urban and rural areas. In Shanghai, eight thousand primary school teachers participated in the Resisting America and Aiding Korea propaganda team during this year's summer vacation. Braving the heat, they went deep into various neighborhoods and small factories to carry out five days of propaganda and education activities, clarifying many people's incorrect views on the situation in Korea, and promoting the patriotic pledge movement, donation movement, and preferential treatment work among the masses. In the donation of airplanes and cannons movement, teachers and students in various regions combined their professional work and spare time to participate in various voluntary labor activities to increase production and donations. At the beginning of this year and in June and July, over 580,000 young people across the country signed up to take the entrance exams for military cadre schools, most of whom were young students. In the enthusiastic atmosphere of sending off their classmates who were embarking on the glorious post of national defense construction, the broad masses of young students put forward the slogan "Studying is fighting, the classroom is the battlefield," encouraging each other to "study hard, exercise, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time." After the vigorous patriotic movement, many old professors who had never participated in collective activities also enthusiastically participated in patriotic demonstrations. Even employees of church schools that had previously accepted American subsidies were drawn into the Resisting America and Aiding Korea movement. They not only severed ties with American imperialism ideologically and economically but also purged the imperialist elements and their lackeys lurking in the schools. The broad masses of teachers participated in political study, and patriotic education in schools at all levels has gradually been integrated into various courses.
    Many medical and health workers have made significant contributions to the sacred cause of Resisting America and Aiding Korea. They risked their lives on the front lines in Korea to rescue wounded soldiers. They drew their own blood in field hospitals to save wounded soldiers in critical condition. Batch after batch, they formed volunteer medical teams and rushed to the front lines in Korea. According to incomplete statistics from September of this year, over 30,000 health workers across the country have signed up to join the volunteer medical teams. Since July of this year, tens of thousands more health workers have responded to the call of the motherland and signed up to participate in national defense health construction work.
    The national literary and art army took up the weapons of propaganda and mobilization and plunged into the Resisting America and Aiding Korea movement. They used various art forms to expose the crimes of American imperialism, and they used various art forms to inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country to resist America and aid Korea. The excellent Korean dispatch "Who Are the Most Beloved People" instilled the lofty patriotism and internationalism of the volunteer soldiers into the cities and villages of the entire country. Millions of people were moved by reading it, further increasing their love for the volunteer soldiers, strengthening their hatred for the enemy, and intensifying their practical actions to resist America and aid Korea. Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) artists from Beijing, Tianjin, and other places formed service teams to visit and comfort the People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front lines, and they also went to various parts of the country to conduct patriotic performances for the broad masses of people. Chang Baokun, a famous artist from Tianjin, and Cheng Shutang, a famous Qin player, gloriously shed their last drop of blood in the work of comforting the Korean front lines. Elderly artists in Beijing in their seventies and eighties shaved off their beards to participate in charity performances to donate the "Lu Xun" airplane.
    Publishing and distribution workers delivered a large number of patriotic books and periodicals to all parts of the country and to the Korean front lines. Xinhua Bookstore has distributed 100 million copies of books and periodicals on Resisting America and Aiding Korea in the past year. The movement to collect books and periodicals for the volunteer army, initiated by Xinhua Bookstore, has achieved great success, receiving 5.5 million books and periodicals donated by people across the country by August. In order to deliver the books and periodicals to the front lines, employees of Xinhua Bookstore and other stores formed battlefield cultural service teams to work in Korea and helped the troops establish more than 3,700 battlefield libraries.
    Scientists and technicians in various regions have conducted multifaceted research to defend and build the motherland. Many scientists and technicians have begun to combine with workers to create industrial products that China has never been able to make on its own, striking a blow to the American imperialist "blockade" and "embargo" aggression plans. Many scientists and technicians have focused on rural areas, researching the prevention and control of disasters, improving varieties, and improving cultivation techniques, helping the patriotic production increase movement of the broad masses of farmers. The spirit of hard struggle of the People's Volunteer Army on the front lines, "a mouthful of fried noodles, a mouthful of snow," greatly moved the domestic scientists and technicians. In Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, and other places, scientists and technicians spontaneously researched and experimented to create dry rations that are convenient for military use, so that the People's Volunteer Army can eat better, be stronger, and annihilate more American aggressor troops.

    文化战线上的抗美援朝工作
    周和
    全国文艺、教育、科学工作者和广大青年学生，在抗美援朝运动中表现了高度的爱国热情。各地的学校师生，热烈参加了抗美援朝的宣传教育工作。察哈尔省一万多教育工作者，在今年“五一”前后的普及抗美援朝宣传运动中，率领全体学生向城乡一百九十万人（将近全省人口一半）进行了爱国宣传。上海市的小学教师，今年暑假中有八千人参加了抗美援朝宣传队。他们冒着炎热，深入各里弄和小型工厂进行了五天的宣传教育活动，澄清了许多群众对朝鲜形势的不正确看法，推动了群众中的爱国公约运动、捐献运动和优抚工作。在捐献飞机大炮运动中，各地学校师生结合业务、利用课余时间，参加了各种增产捐献的义务劳动。今年年初和六七月间，全国有五十八万多青年报名投考军事干部学校，其中绝大部分是青年学生。广大青年学生在欢送走上国防建设光荣岗位的同学的热烈气氛中，提出了“学习就是战斗、课堂就是战场”的口号，互相勉励要“学好功课，锻炼身体，随时响应祖国号召”。经过轰轰烈烈的爱国运动，许多从来不参加集体活动的老教授们也热烈参加了爱国示威游行。曾经接受美国津贴的教会学校员工也卷入了抗美援朝运动。他们不独在思想上、经济上割断了与美帝国主义的联系，而且清除了潜伏在学校里的帝国主义分子及其走狗。广大教师参加了政治学习，各级学校的爱国主义教育，已逐步贯串到各种课程中去。
    许多医药卫生工作者，在抗美援朝的神圣事业中有着重大的贡献。他们在朝鲜前线出生入死地抢救受伤的战士。他们在战地医院里抽下自己的鲜血急救伤员。他们成批成批地组成志愿医疗队奔赴朝鲜前线。据今年九月的不完全统计，全国报名参加志愿医疗队的卫生工作者已有三万多人。今年七月以来，又有成万的卫生工作者响应祖国号召，报名参加国防卫生建设工作。
    全国文艺大军，拿起了宣传鼓动的武器投入抗美援朝运动。他们以各种艺术形式揭露美帝国主义的罪恶，他们以各种艺术形式鼓舞全国人民抗美爱国的热情。优秀的朝鲜通讯“谁是最可爱的人”，把志愿军战士崇高的爱国主义与国际主义精神灌注到了全国的城市和农村。千万人读着它受了感动，更增长了对志愿军的热爱，增强了对敌人的仇恨，加紧了抗美援朝的实际行动。北京、天津等地的曲艺艺人，组成服务大队到朝鲜前线慰问了人民志愿军，又分赴全国各地向广大人民进行了爱国的宣传演出。天津名艺人常宝堃和名琴师程树棠，在朝鲜前线慰问工作中光荣地流尽了最后一滴血。北京市的七八十岁的老艺人，他们有的剃下了胡子，为捐献“鲁迅号”飞机参加义演。
    出版发行工作者把大量的爱国读物分送到了全国各地和朝鲜前线。新华书店一年来发行了抗美援朝书刊一万万册。由新华书店发起的为志愿军募集书刊运动已收到很大成绩，到八月份就收到了全国人民捐献的书刊五百五十万册。为了把书刊送到前方，新华书店等店的职工组成了战地文化服务队赴朝鲜工作，并帮助部队建立了三千七百多个战地图书馆。
    各地科学工作者为保卫祖国、建设祖国进行了多方面的研究工作。许多科学工作者已开始和工人结合，创制了中国从来不能自制的工业品，打击了美帝国主义“封锁”、“禁运”的侵略计划。许多科学工作者面向农村，研究防治灾害、改良品种和提高耕作技术，帮助了广大农民的爱国丰产运动。人民志愿军在前线“一口炒面一口雪”的那种艰苦奋斗精神，大大地感动了国内的科学工作者。北京、上海、济南等地，都有科学工作者自发地研究试验，创制便于军用的干粮，让人民志愿军吃得好些，身体壮些，更多地歼灭美国侵略军。
