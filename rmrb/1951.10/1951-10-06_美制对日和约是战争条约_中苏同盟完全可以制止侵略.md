    The US-Imposed Peace Treaty with Japan is a War Treaty
    The Sino-Soviet Alliance Can Completely Prevent Aggression
Editor:
    Our reading group studied Foreign Minister Zhou’s statement on September 18th regarding "the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan signed by the United States and its vassal states" and the People's Daily editorial "Crush the US Aggressive Plan to Enslave the Asian People," and then held a forum. During the forum, the students further realized that the US-imposed peace treaty with Japan is an aggressive treaty that revives Japanese militarism, antagonizes China and the Soviet Union, disrupts Asian peace, and prepares for a new war. We express our firm opposition to the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan, which was prepared, drafted, and signed without our country's participation.
    During the discussion, everyone deeply felt that the great Chinese people, who have already stood up, and the strong alliance with the powerful world peace fortress of the Soviet Union, which is formed for the purpose of preventing imperialist aggression, have the full power to smash the US aggressive plan to enslave the Asian people. Finally, the students all expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement, and their determination to oppose the US rearmament of Japan with practical actions.

### 美制对日和约是战争条约  中苏同盟完全可以制止侵略

    美制对日和约是战争条约
    中苏同盟完全可以制止侵略编辑同志：
    我们读报组学习了周外长九月十八日“关于美国及其仆从国家签订旧金山对日和约的声明”和人民日报“打碎美国奴役亚洲人民的侵略计划”的社论后，曾举行了一次座谈会。在座谈会上，同学们进一步认识到美制对日和约是一个复活日本军国主义、敌视中苏、破坏亚洲和平与准备新战争的侵略条约。对于这样一个没有我国参加准备拟制和签订的旧金山对日和约，我们表示坚决的反对。
    在座谈中，大家深深地体会到：已经站起来了的伟大的中国人民，和强大的世界和平堡垒苏联结成的以制止帝国主义侵略为目的的巩固同盟，完全有力量粉碎美国奴役亚洲人民的侵略计划。最后，同学们都表示要坚决拥护周外长的庄严声明，决心以实际行动来反对美国重新武装日本。
