    I want to dedicate everything to defending the motherland
    To the Editor:
    I am a member of the People's Liberation Army. I am extremely excited to see our army advancing rapidly towards modernization; but I am also a bit distressed because I am lagging behind the requirements of the troops. However, after reading "I gave my whole life to the Party," I gained new strength and new courage. I am determined to work boldly and learn humbly, and dedicate everything I have to defending our motherland.

    我要为捍卫祖国献出一切编辑同志：
    我是人民解放军的一分子；我看到我军向现代化方向突飞猛进的时候，兴奋极了；但也有点苦恼，因为自己落后于部队的要求了。可是读了“我把整个生命交给了党”之后，我增加了新的力量，新的勇气。我决心大胆地去工作，虚心地去学习，为捍卫我们的祖国而献出自己的一切。
