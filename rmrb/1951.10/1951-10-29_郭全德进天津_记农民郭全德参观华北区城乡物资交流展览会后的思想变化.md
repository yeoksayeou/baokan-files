    Guo Quande Enters Tianjin
    ——A Record of Farmer Guo Quande's Ideological Changes After Visiting the North China Regional Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition
    Guan Wen
    The train departed from Yuci. Guo Quande sat next to a small window, smoking and thinking: "Since childhood, I fled the famine from Pingyuan, Linxian, to Songjia Village, Changzhi, Shanxi. At thirteen, I herded sheep for the landlord. In 1945, I joined the revolution. In 1948, I joined the Chinese Communist Party. I achieved success in drought-resistant irrigation and became a water conservancy model worker. Last year, I attended the provincial labor model conference and learned that 'organization is stronger than working alone.' This year, the mutual aid group has grown from four households to eight. What should I do next year?" Just as he was worrying about what to do, the higher-ups told him to go to Tianjin to visit and learn from experience. He was really happy. Tianjin is a big place, and there must be all kinds of things. The night before leaving home, he went to find Liang Donggouzi, a 78-year-old man in the village: "Grandpa, what do you need? I'll bring you something back." Liang Donggouzi said: "Quande, don't bother bringing anything. I don't want to be cheated. I've seen farmers go to the city before. We old mountain folks look like yokels. They'll ask us four thousand for something that clearly sells for three thousand."
    Guo Quande had never been to the city, but he had heard stories of farmers being deceived. He thought, "Liang Donggouzi is wrong, right? Chairman Mao is leading us now. Would that kind of thing still happen?" Then he thought, "It's true that Chairman Mao is leading us well, but Tianjin has only been liberated for a little over two years. Can things have changed so quickly?"
    He passed countless train stations, and at every station, people welcomed and saw them off. When he got off the train in Tianjin, it was even more so: getting off the train and onto the bus, one person asked, "Comrades, are you tired?" Another snatched their luggage and carried it onto the bus. Guo Quande was still apprehensive, holding his bedding tightly, afraid of being stolen by thieves. The workers and citizens of Tianjin were so enthusiastic, but Guo Quande thought it was "city people putting on an act." After staying in Tianjin for two days, he realized he was wrong. When he entered the landlord's house, they prepared tea, water for washing his face, and everything was so thoughtful. He had lived for forty-five years and had never seen such white sheets on a bed. There were receptionists leading the way, and they received preferential treatment when buying things. "I never dreamed of such a good thing. What is Liang Donggouzi talking about?" "Comrade, give me some kenaf seeds."
    Walking into the exhibition, Guo Quande saw that everything in front of him was new and beautiful. "Chairman Mao is leading us. We have so much property!" When he arrived at the economic crops hall, he saw kenaf, and Guo Quande remembered a story. Last year, after returning home from the provincial labor model conference, he promoted the planting of kenaf to the farmers. The people said, "Show us the kenaf." Quande didn't bring any kenaf with him from the province, so he couldn't show it to them, and the people didn't believe his promotion. It was the same with the promotion of waterwheels in 1949. He had already discussed buying a waterwheel with four or five families, but overnight, things changed again. Someone even whispered behind his back: "Quande, let's see what you do!" After much persuasion, they managed to buy a waterwheel. As soon as the waterwheel irrigated the land, everyone's eyes lit up. They didn't expect this thing to be so important, and they all wanted to buy shares in the waterwheel.
    He didn't expect to encounter kenaf again in Tianjin. This time, he couldn't be careless again. The guide said that the method of planting kenaf was similar to that of planting *Lu* hemp. Guo Quande wrote down what the guide said in his heart, and fearing that he would forget, he asked the guide to write it down in his notebook. Before leaving, he said: "Comrade, can you give me a strand of kenaf and a few kenaf seeds?" The guide gave him dozens of seeds and a strand of hemp. Quande wrapped them all in paper and thought, "This time, the villagers should believe me." That day, when he was eating, he said to Zhang Heqi from Wuma Village: "I plan to go back to the village and mobilize the masses to plant 150 *mu* more next year than this year, and change all the *Lu* hemp to kenaf. One *mu* of kenaf yields more than two *mu* of *Lu* hemp, and it is convenient for the factories to use. Who wouldn't rush to do such a good thing!" A nail met a magnet.
    Walking to the heavy industry hall, Guo Quande was like a nail that had met a magnet, unable to move.
    In the heavy industry hall, there was a "charcoal engine water pump." Guo Quande asked: "What is this thing used for?" The guide said: "It is installed on a well to irrigate the land. It can irrigate two or three hundred *mu* a day, and it only needs to burn twenty *jin* of charcoal." When Quande heard this, he became excited. He squatted next to the machine and stared at it. The machine was not big, with so many "mechanisms" and "gadgets." It didn't need a cart to pull it, it could be moved by pushing it. With such a thing, he wouldn't have to worry about drought. He couldn't help but say: "The workers are capable. They really deserve to be called elder brothers. Don't even mention asking me to make this machine. Just looking at it makes my head spin."
    In the past, the higher Party organization often told Guo Quande: "The working class is the leading class of our country. The peasants must accept the leadership of the working class." The higher-ups didn't lie to the lower-ups, but Quande never understood: "How does the working class lead?" After seeing the exhibition, Guo Quande realized the working class's advanced nature, foresight, and selflessness. He was finally convinced. A single person turning the pulley could not compete with the waterwheel pulled by an ox. This "charcoal engine water pump" didn't cost much and could do the work of several waterwheels. If a machine was attached to the back of a tractor, it could do all the work in the field, including plowing, sowing, harvesting, and loading. The collective farms in the Soviet Union had electric lights, telephones, and even used electricity for cooking. We think we are doing well in the mountains with a cow, two rooms, and a few *mu* of land, but who knew that we are far behind! "The working class elder brothers are like locomotives. If our carriages can't be hitched to the locomotive, we can forget about having a better life."
    Guo Quande felt that the seven days he stayed in Tianjin passed in the blink of an eye. Two days before he left, a joint labor-peasant get-together was held. Several dock workers grabbed his hand, invited him to eat snacks, and told him, "We are one family, don't be polite." Guo Quande thought: "In the past, workers and peasants never saw each other, but now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have become one family." He had thousands of words in his heart, but he couldn't say a word. He stared at the worker comrades for a long time before finally saying: "We are closer than blood brothers!" His eyes immediately became wet. (Originally published in Tianjin Daily)

    郭全德进天津
    ——记农民郭全德参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会后的思想变化
    贯文
    火车从榆次开了，郭全德挨着个小窗户坐着，一面抽烟一面想：咱自小从平原林县逃荒到山西长治宋家庄，十三岁上给地主放羊，一九四五年参加革命，一九四八年参加了中国共产党；抗旱浇地有成绩，当了水利模范；去年参加了省劳动模范大会，学到了“组织起来比单干强”，今年的互助组，由四户增加到八户，明年该怎办呀？正愁着没办法，上级教来天津参观、学经验；心里真高兴。天津是大地方，各种物件一定有。离家的那天晚上，去找当村七十八岁的梁东狗子：“老大爷，你缺啥东西我给你捎点来。”梁东狗子说：“全德你甭捎，省得我上当，庄稼人进城我经着过，咱这土眉熊眼的老山汉，明明卖三千，他得给咱要四千。”
    郭全德没有进过城，可是庄稼人受骗的事他听人说过，他想：“梁东狗子说得不对吧！如今毛主席领导，还会有那种事？”又想：“毛主席领导得好是真的，可是天津才解放了两年多，能变得那么快吗！”
    路过的火车站数不清，站站有人欢迎欢送，下了天津车站，就更不用提了：下火车上汽车，这个问“同志们累不累”？那个夺过行李来往汽车上扛。郭全德还是提心吊胆，铺盖抱得紧紧的，小心被贼偷走。天津的工人、市民这样热情，郭全德却认为是“城里人变戏法”。在天津住了两天，他就觉着自己想错了。进了房东家，茶水、洗脸水，准备了个周到；已经活了四十五，还没有看到过床上那样白的单子，走动有招待员领着，买东西受优待，“作梦也梦不到这种美事，梁东狗子说的是个啥呀！”“同志，给我几颗洋麻籽。”
    走进展览会，郭全德看见眼前摆的样样都新鲜，样样都好看。“毛主席领导，咱这家当多么大呀！”到了经济作物馆，看见了洋麻，郭全德想起了一段故事。去年从省劳动模范大会开完会回到家，给农民群众宣传种洋麻，群众说：“拿出洋麻来我看看。”全德在省里没有要点洋麻带着，拿不出来，群众就不信他的宣传了。一九四九年推广水车也是这样，已经和四、五家商量好了伙买一架水车，睡了一宿觉就又变了“卦”，有人还背地里吹气：“全德，看你怎么办！”千说、百说的动员，算是买上了一架水车。水车一浇地，大伙红了眼，想不到这家伙顶那么大事，纷纷要入股买水车了。
    想不到来到天津又碰见了洋麻，这回可再不能马虎过去。讲解员说，种洋麻和种潞麻的方法差不多。郭全德把讲解员说的话记在了心里，怕忘了又请讲解员记在本子上。临走时说：“同志，把洋麻给我一缕、麻籽给几颗好不好？”讲解员送给了他几十颗麻籽和一缕麻，全德通通用纸包起来，心里想：“这回村里人该相信了。”那天吃饭的时候，他给五马村的张和气说：“我打算回村动员群众，明年比今年多种一百五十亩，把潞麻都改成洋麻，一亩洋麻比二亩潞麻收的还多，工厂里用着又方便，这样好事谁还不抢着干！”铁钉碰上了吸铁石
    走到重工业馆，郭全德好像铁钉碰上了吸铁石，动弹不得了。
    重工业馆里放着一架“木炭引擎抽水泵”，郭全德问：“这家伙干什么用？”讲解员说：按在井上浇地用，一天能浇二、三百亩，烧上二十斤木炭就够了。全德一听兴头上来了，蹲在机器旁边一个劲地瞅，机器不大，这么一个“机关”那么一个“机关”，不用大车拉，推着就能动，有这么个东西，天旱不发愁了。嘴里不由得说：“工人能耐大，真称得起老大哥，莫说叫咱做这机器，看看就眼花了。”
    从前上级党组织也常给郭全德讲：“工人阶级是我们国家的领导阶级，农民要接受工人阶级领导。”上级不给下级说谎话，可是全德总想不通：“工人阶级怎的个领导啊？”郭全德看了展览会，才体会到了工人阶级的先进、有远见、大公无私，他才心服了。单人拧辘辘把子顶不住牛拉的水车，这架“木炭引擎抽水泵”开销不大，能顶好几架水车干的活；拖拉机后面按上机器，能把地里的全套活儿干了，能耕、能耩、能收、能装；苏联的集体农场，有电灯、电话，作饭都用电，咱山沟里有上一条牛、两间房、几亩地就觉得日子过得不错了，谁知道还差得远呢！“工人老大哥就是火车头，咱这车皮挂不上火车头，日子甭想过得再好。”
    在天津住了七天，郭全德觉着一眨眼就过去了。临走的前两天开工农联欢大会，几个码头工人拉住了他的手，请他吃点心，告诉他“一家人别客气”。郭全德心里想：“过去工人农民谁都见不着谁，现在毛主席领导的变成了一家人。”心里有千万句话，嘴里说不出一句来，两眼瞅着工人同志，停了老半天才说：“咱比亲兄弟还亲！”紧跟着眼睛湿了。（原载天津日报）
