    Hebei Province's Slow Seed Cotton Processing Hinders Timely Supply for Industrial Needs

    Since the large-scale market launch of new cotton in September, cotton purchasing agencies in various parts of Hebei Province have vigorously carried out the work of purchasing and storing new cotton and have overfulfilled the purchase tasks for September. However, because most cotton purchasing agencies in the province cannot promptly gin the seed cotton into lint, pack it, and transport it, the supply of raw cotton to the textile industry is affected. At present, textile factories across the country have resumed full shifts, and some in Tianjin and other places have even changed from a two-shift to a three-shift system, and are actively organizing shock production increase tasks. Therefore, stepping up the transfer of raw cotton to support them has become an urgent task.
    Hebei Province's seed cotton processing is relatively slow. According to incomplete statistics as of mid-October, more than 82 million catties of seed cotton purchased in the province have not been processed. The vast majority of this is stockpiled by cooperatives. For example, Shijiazhuang Prefecture has stockpiled about 14 million catties, Handan Prefecture more than 20 million catties, Xingtai Prefecture and Nangong, Wei County and other counties about 10 million catties, and other cotton-producing areas also have stockpiles. In some areas, such as Linzhang, Linqing, and Chengan counties, some of the stockpiled seed cotton has shown signs of heating up and mold. According to an investigation and research by the province's Finance and Economics Committee, the reasons for the stockpiling phenomenon are fourfold: (1) Before the start of the new cotton purchase work, although the Central Finance and Economics Committee and the province's Finance and Economics Committee had already instructed that ginning work should be actively prepared to realize the requirements of "fast collection, fast ginning, and fast transportation," cotton purchasing agencies at all levels did not seriously implement this; (2) Some counties are unwilling to allow seed cotton to leave the county in order to solve the fertilizer problem, and some cooperatives have departmentalism viewpoints, attempting to keep the seed cotton and slowly organize members to process it, unwilling to transfer it to power-driven cotton gins in towns for processing, and at the same time not actively organizing non-member manual cotton gin processing; (3) The processing fees paid by cooperatives to power-driven and manual cotton gins are too low, so many power-driven gins would rather stop than process; manual cotton gins are unwilling to gin cotton because the busy farming season has not passed, and the processing fee is low; (4) Leading organs at all levels have not promptly conducted in-depth inspections of such phenomena and corrected them.
    The province's Finance and Economics Committee has issued instructions for this purpose, requiring all agencies with stockpiled seed cotton, especially cooperatives at all levels, to overcome all difficulties and actively organize ginning work. It requires finance committees at all levels to strengthen inspection and supervision. It has also decided to increase ginning processing fees (power-driven gins will increase the processing fee by four to eight catties of millet per hundred catties, and manual gins will increase it by four catties) in order to promote the normalization of this work.

    河北省籽棉加工迟缓
    不能及时供应工业需要
    自九月新棉大量上市后，河北省各地收棉机构曾大力开展购储新棉工作，并超额完成九月份收购任务。但因该省多数地区收棉机构不能及时将籽棉轧成皮棉，打包调运，以致影响对纺织工业原棉的供应。目前全国各地纺织工厂均已恢复全班，天津等地有的且已改每日二班制为三班制，并积极组织突击增产任务，因而各地加紧调运原棉予以支持，成为当前紧迫的任务。
    河北省在籽棉加工方面进行是比较缓慢的。截至十月中旬的不完全的统计，该省收购的籽棉，未加工者在八千二百万斤以上。其中绝大多数是合作社所积压的。如石家庄专区约积存一千四百多万斤，邯郸专区二千多万斤，邢台专区和南宫、威县等县约一千多万斤，其他各产棉区也均有积压。若干地区如：临漳、临清、成安等县积压之籽棉，部分已有发热、发霉现象。据该省财政经济委员会调查研究，认为产生积压现象的原因有四：（一）在新棉收购工作开始之前，中央财政经济委员会及该省财政经济委员会，虽早已指示应积极准备轧花工作，以实现“快收、快轧、快运”的要求，但各级收棉机构并未认真执行；（二）某些县为了解决本县肥料问题，不愿籽棉出境和有的合作社存在本位主义观点，企图把籽棉留下慢慢组织社员加工，不愿调给城镇动力轧花车加工，同时也不积极组织非社员人力轧花车加工。（三）合作社付给动力和人力轧花车的加工费太低，因此曾有不少动力车宁愿停车不予加工；人力轧车因农忙未过，再加加工费低也不愿轧花；（四）各级领导机关对此类现象没有及时深入检查并加以纠正。
    该省财政经济委员会为此曾发布指示，要求各积压籽棉机构，特别是各级合作社克服一切困难，积极组织轧花工作。要求各级财委加强检查督促。并决定提高轧花加工费（动力轧车每百斤加工费提高四至八斤小米，人力轧车提高四斤），以期推动这一工作走向正常。（林形如）
