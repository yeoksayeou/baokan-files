We walked across a large bridge near the front line in broad daylight. In the fields on both sides of the bridge, Korean farmers were working intently. The autumn land was golden, with corn and rice growing abundantly. Military vehicles and amphibious vehicles transported supplies back and forth across the bridge and in the river in an orderly manner, and infantry and artillery units passed over the bridge in a steady stream, heading towards the front. A roar of engines sounded, and a squadron of American planes arrived. They flew high above the bridge, almost making it impossible to see the shadows of these aerial thieves.

However, the situation was completely different just a few months ago. At that time, enemy planes flew so low that they skimmed over the low trees and even blew the roofs off the thatched cottages on the edges of the fields. Farmers could only take cover during the day and work at night. The bridge was constantly bombed and broken. But the stubborn people repaired the bridge time and time again.

We visited the heroic gunners of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit stationed near the bridge. In more than a month after the beginning of August, they shot down or damaged thirty enemy planes, striking a blow against the arrogance of the American and British aerial butchers. Since they arrived here, the bridge had not been damaged by enemy planes at all, except for being washed away twice by floods.

When they first arrived, the American planes had not yet realized that the bridge had been armed, and they still swooped down on the bridge recklessly. As a result, the American aerial thieves were punished; some were shot down, some were damaged, and after that, American planes dared not fly low over the bridge.

The American aerial thieves were not reconciled, and sometimes they sought opportunities in the evening or morning fog to attack the bridge. On the morning of August 25, four Mustang fighters dived straight down at the bridge as soon as they flew over it. But our gunners were already prepared, and the first shell hit an enemy plane. Instantly, the plane nosedived and crashed on the hillside opposite. The two bombs on the wings also detonated, and the plane was immediately blown to pieces. A hairy, bloodstained hand that had slaughtered countless Korean people and three feet wearing large leather boots were disgracefully left on the hillside.

After that, the timid American aerial thieves secretly came to harass us at night. On the night of September 30, two American night-flying planes came and dropped incendiary bombs and flares. One enemy plane dived down under the flares and strafed. At that time, the flares illuminated the plane brightly, and the anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns guarding the bridge suddenly roared, and a dense net of fire surrounded the enemy plane. Immediately, an enemy plane was hit, smoking and crashing straight down. Since then, the aerial robbers dared not be rampant at night either.

The increasingly powerful people's anti-aircraft artillery is dealing heavier and heavier blows to the brutal and cowardly aerial robbers. This has effectively ensured the transportation tasks at the front, while also continuously depleting the enemy's air force and demoralizing its soldiers. We spoke with two American air force prisoners of war. One was named Blanhold and the other was Vanderford; the former was the pilot and the latter was the gunner. They were on the same B-25 light bomber when it was shot down by our army and they were captured. They belonged to the 72nd Bombardment Squadron of the US Air Force. The squadron had a total of eighteen aircraft, and since the start of combat, six had been shot down by the anti-aircraft artillery of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies (not counting those that were damaged). After their plane was shot down, only eleven remained. Whenever they talked about our anti-aircraft fire, they couldn't help but be frightened. Blanhold confessed: Since the anti-aircraft artillery of the Chinese and Korean People's forces has been increasing day by day since this spring, the laughter in the US Air Force barracks has gradually disappeared. He said, "Comrades are always worried about whether they will be able to return before they set off every day." (Xinhua News Agency)

    从一座桥看美军“空中优势”
      王玉章   韩庆祥
    我们在大白天走过临近前线的一座大桥。在这桥的两边田野里，朝鲜农民正在专心一意地干活。秋季的土地上一片金黄色，苞米、稻子长得很丰满。军用汽车和水陆两用汽车在桥上和江中井然有序地来回运输物资，步兵部队和炮兵部队源源不断地通过这座大桥奔向前方。一阵马达声轰响，一队美国飞机来了。它们经过这座桥的上空时飞得很高，几乎使人不能看到这些飞贼们的影子。
    可是在几个月之前，情形就完全不是这个样子。当时的敌机飞得那样低，掠过低矮的树林，甚至把田垅边茅草屋的屋顶也掀掉了。农民们只能白天防空，夜间干活。大桥不断地被炸断了。但是，倔强的人们一次又一次地把桥修好。
    我们访问了守卫在这座大桥附近的某高射炮队的英雄射击手们，他们在八月初以后的一个多月中，击落击伤敌机三十架，打掉了横行霸道的美、英空中屠手的凶焰，他们来到这里后，大桥除了被大水冲坏两次外，没有受到过敌机的任何破坏。
    他们才来时，美国飞机还没有发觉这座大桥已经武装起来了，仍是肆无忌惮地向着大桥俯冲下来。于是美国飞贼得到惩罚了，有的被击落，有的被击伤，以后美国飞机就不敢在大桥的上空低飞了。
    美国飞贼们还不甘心，有时他们寻找傍晚或晨雾的时机向大桥袭击。八月二十五日早晨，四架野马式飞机一飞到桥的上空，就向大桥直冲下来。但是我们的炮手早已准备好了，第一发炮弹就命中一架敌机。顿时，那架飞机直栽下来掉在对面的山坡上，装在机翼上的两颗炸弹也撞响了，飞机立即被炸得粉碎。一只毛茸茸的曾经屠杀过无数朝鲜人民的血手和三只穿着大皮靴的脚可耻地残留在山坡上。
    此后，胆怯的美国飞贼们又偷偷地在黑夜里来骚扰。九月三十日晚上，两架美国夜行机飞来投下燃烧弹与照明弹，有一架敌机俯冲到照明弹下面扫射起来。当时照明弹照得飞机闪闪发亮，守卫在大桥附近的高射炮和高射机枪突然吼叫了，密密的火网包围了敌机。立刻一架敌机被击中冒着烟火直摔下来，从此，空中强盗们在夜间也不敢猖狂了。
    已经是相当强大的人民高射炮队对凶残而又懦怯的空中强盗的打击是越来越沉重了，这样就有力地保证了前线的运输任务，同时也不断地消耗了敌人空军的有生力量并使其士气低落。我们曾经和两个美国空军俘虏谈话。其中一个叫布兰回德，一个叫范德福；前者是驾驶员，后者是射击手，同在一架Ｂ二十五型轻轰炸机上被我军击落后被俘的。他们属于美空军第七十二轰炸机中队。该中队共有十八架飞机，作战以来被中朝人民军队的高射炮队击落了六架（伤的不算），当他们这架飞机又被击落后，只剩下十一架了。他们一谈起我们的对空射击炮火，总不免心惊肉跳。布兰回德供称：自从今春中朝人民部队的高射炮日益增多以后，美国空军宿舍里的欢笑声已逐渐消失了。他说：“同伴们在每天出发前都老是担心是否能够回来。”（新华社）
