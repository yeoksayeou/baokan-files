    Encourage Private Capital to Go to the Countryside
    The successful experience of the private China Farmland Water Conservancy Company in establishing the Yitai Dike mechanical drainage station in the suburbs of Wuhu City, southern Anhui, points out a broad prospect for private capital to invest in farmland water conservancy projects.
    There are three reasons for the success of the Yitai Dike mechanical drainage station: First, the People's Government provided spiritual encouragement and material support; second, the local farmers warmly welcomed and actively assisted; and third, the private China Farmland Water Conservancy Company displayed a high degree of initiative.
    Article 30 of the Common Program stipulates: "The People's Government should encourage the enthusiasm of private economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and assist their development." The People's Government resolutely implements the provisions of the Common Program, and in the past, present, and future, encourages and supports the development of private industry and commerce in directions that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. After the land reform, the productivity of farmers was liberated, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and they urgently demanded scientific and mechanical assistance. In China, with a farming population of over 400 million, mechanical farmland water conservancy projects have unlimited development prospects. The policy is clear, and the conditions are excellent. As long as private industrialists and merchants recognize this situation, give full play to their initiative, enthusiastically go to the countryside, and are good at management, their careers will surely achieve broad development.

    After seeing the Materials Exhibition, My Thinking Has Improved
        Zeng Guangfu, Agricultural Labor Model of Pingyuan Province
    I am a farmer representative from Pingyuan Province, and I am particularly happy to be here in Tianjin to visit the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition. After we arrived in Tianjin, we were warmly welcomed and hosted by the workers. I think this kind of fraternal unity between workers and peasants can only occur under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    I stayed in Tianjin for six or seven days, visited the exhibition, and listened to speeches by many leaders. I truly understood the importance of the worker-peasant alliance. In the past, I couldn't understand the principle of "taking the working class as the leader and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation." I always thought that the workers were in the city and we were in the countryside, and the workers couldn't work for us. Even without the leadership of the workers, we could still make a revolution. After visiting various factories this time, I understood this principle. I saw with my own eyes that a worker in a spinning mill manages twenty-four looms and can weave more than three thousand feet of cloth a day. A rural woman can weave at most ten feet of cloth a day. At the exhibition, I saw a tractor that plows more than one hundred acres of land per hour, while a wooden plow can only plow two or three acres of land per day. These machines are all made for us by our elder brothers, the workers. Without our elder brothers, the workers, we cannot improve production, consolidate national defense, and build our beautiful society.
    During the visit, I also saw that the grain eaten by our elder brothers, the workers, and the raw materials used for their work, are all produced by us farmers. If we do not supply industrial raw materials, the machines cannot produce, and the necessities of our lives cannot be manufactured. This means that workers and peasants must achieve great unity in order to rapidly develop industry and agriculture.
    What should we do in the future? I think we should produce according to the state's plan; we will produce whatever the state needs and what the factories need. Our village planted 20 mu of cotton the year before last, 210 mu last year, and 514 mu this year. We guarantee to plant 1,200 mu of cotton next year, reaching two-thirds of the cultivated area. This year I planted six mu of cotton. Before this visit, I planned to plant ten mu next year. After the visit, I realized the importance of cotton and guarantee to plant twelve mu next year. Except for three catties of low-quality cotton per person for clothing, all the rest will be sold to the state. I will also lead the masses to grow industrial raw materials such as tobacco leaves, kenaf, and flax seeds. Of course, I must not forget to produce enough grain to supply the cities.
    Now I truly recognize the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, and the greatness and loveliness of our worker brothers. I will resolutely defend our happy life. I guarantee to do a good job in production. If the motherland needs it, I will step forward and be a model for supporting the front.

    Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance, Develop Agricultural Production
        Ma Yiqian, Agricultural Labor Model of Chahar Province
    This time, I have gained a lot from visiting the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition; although I have never attended school for a day since I was a child, this visit is equivalent to living in a university.
    What have I learned here? The most important thing is that I understand the principle that we must rely on the leadership of the working class. In the past, although I often promoted the working class leading the peasants in the village, I always thought: "If it weren't for the peasants farming, no one would have food to eat, and the peasants should be in a leading position." In fact, this idea is wrong. Take the chaff cutter produced by the workers that I saw in the Agricultural Production Materials Hall: as long as a woman feeds grass into the machine, it can cut more than 500 catties in an hour; if we use the chaff knives currently used in rural areas, two young and strong lads can cut at most one hundred catties a day with great effort. Threshing machines, grass cutters, etc., can increase our production by a thousandfold or a hundredfold. This clearly tells me that if we peasants do not have the help of our worker brothers, we cannot farm well.
    I also understand that we must study science. In our rural areas, every household raises chickens and pigs; in the past, we didn't raise them properly, they didn't grow meat, and the chickens laid very few eggs. After this visit, I realized that to raise chickens and pigs well, we must pay attention to hygiene; I also understood the principle of improving breeding livestock; and I also knew that eggs and pig bristles are particularly useful and can be exported in exchange for machines.
    I also knew that we must grow more cash crops. The land in our village is originally suitable for growing oil crops. In the past, people were afraid that they would not be able to sell them, and no one was willing to grow more. Everyone had a small plan, as long as they had enough to eat and light their lamps for a year. After this visit, I realized that these things are not only essential raw materials for our industry, but also can be exported, and growing more of these things is of great benefit to the country.
    I have learned a lot from this exhibition. This time, the first thing I will do when I go back is to tell everyone in the village what I saw and heard at the meeting; at the same time, I will go wherever I go and promote the situation of this exhibition and the principles I understand, so that more people know about it.
    Second, we must vigorously promote new-style farm implements. Our village already has three seven-inch walking plows, but that is too few. This time, I will definitely promote it to everyone and buy a few more new-style walking plows, and if possible, the village will buy another chaff cutter.
    Third, we must supply a large amount of industrial raw materials and grain. Just like the slogans shouted at the worker-peasant get-together, "Consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and develop agricultural production."

    鼓励私人资本下乡
    私营中国农田水利公司兴办皖南芜湖市郊区易太圩机械排水站成功的经验，给私人资本投资于农田水利事业，指出了广大的发展前途。
    易太圩机械排水站成功的原因有三个：第一、人民政府给予了精神的鼓励和物质的支持；第二、当地农民的热烈欢迎与积极协助；第三、私营中国农田水利公司发挥了高度的积极性。
    共同纲领第三十条规定：“凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，人民政府应鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展。”人民政府坚决执行共同纲领的规定，过去、现在与将来，都是鼓励与支持私营工商业向有利于国计民生的方向发展的。土地改革后，农民的生产力获得解放，生产积极性空前提高，迫切要求科学与机械的援助。在四亿以上农业人口的中国，机械农田水利事业，实有无限发展的前途。政策是明确的，条件是优越的，只要私营工商业者认识这种形势，发挥高度的积极性，踊跃下乡，善于经营，那末，他们的事业一定可以获得广大的发展的。看了物资展览会，我的思想
    提高了
        平原省农业劳动模范曾广福
    我是平原省的农民代表，这次来天津参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会，心里特别高兴。我们到天津后，受到了工人的热烈欢迎和招待，我想这种工农的友爱团结，只有在共产党、毛主席的领导下，才会出现。
    我在天津市住了六、七天，参观了展览会，又听了许多首长的讲话，真正认识了工农联盟的重要。过去我对“以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础”的道理，总是想不通，认为工人在城市，我们在乡村，工人又不能替我们干活，没有工人领导，我们也一样革命。这次到各个工厂参观后，我才明白了这个道理。我亲眼看到纺纱厂一个工人管二十四部布机，每天能织布三千多尺，一个农村妇女，每天顶快能织十尺多布。在展览会上，我看到一个拖拉机，每小时犁一百多亩地，一张木犁，每天只能犁两、三亩地。这些机器都是工人老大哥给我们制造的，离开工人老大哥，我们就不能提高生产，巩固国防，建设我们美好的社会。
    参观中，我又看到，工人老大哥吃的粮食，作活用的原料，都是我们农民生产的。我们如果不供给工业原料，机器就不能生产，我们生活的必需品，也就不能制造了。这就是说，工人和农民，必须做到大团结，这才能使工农业很快发展。
    今后应该怎么办呢？我想，应该按照国家的计划来生产；国家需要什么，工厂需要什么，我们就生产什么。俺村前年种棉二十亩，去年种二百一十亩，今年种五百十四亩，明年保证种棉一千二百亩，达到耕地面积的三分之二。我今年种棉六亩，没有来参观前，我计划明年种十亩，参观后，我认识到棉花的重要，保证明年种十二亩，所收的棉花除每人留三斤次花穿用外，其余全部卖给国家。我还要带领群众种烟叶、洋麻、麻子等工业原料；当然，我也不能忘记生产足够粮食，来供给城市。
    现在我真正认识了祖国的伟大和可爱，工人兄弟的伟大和可爱。我要坚决保卫我们的幸福生活。我保证搞好生产。如果祖国需要，我就挺身而出，做个支援前线模范。巩固工农联盟，发展农业生产
    察哈尔省农业劳动模范马益谦
    我这次参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会，收获真是不小；虽说我从小没有念过一天书，这回参观，可等于住了一次大学堂。
    在这里我学习到了一些什么东西呢？顶重要的是我明白了必须依靠工人阶级领导这个道理。在过去，虽然我在村子里也常常宣传工人阶级领导农民，可是我总是这么想：“如果不是农民种地，谁都吃不上饭，应当是农民占领导地位。”其实这个想法是不对的。就拿我在农业生产资料馆里看到的工人老大哥生产出来的铡草机来说吧：只要有一个妇女往机器里送草，在一个钟头内就能铡五百多斤；要是拿现在农村里使用的铡草刀，两个年青力壮的小伙子，费上九牛二虎的力气，一天顶多不过铡百十来斤。打麦机、割草机等，都能千倍百倍提高我们的生产。这就明明白白地告诉了我，如果我们农民没有工人老大哥的帮助，地是种不好的。
    我还懂得了必须学习科学。我们在农村里，家家户户都养了鸡，养了猪；过去我们养的不得法，既长不出肉来，鸡下的蛋也很少。经过这次参观以后，我才知道要养好鸡，养好猪，也要讲卫生；也懂得了改良种畜的道理；更知道了鸡蛋、猪鬃的用处特别大，能够出口换回机器。
    我也知道了必须多种经济作物。我们村子里的地，本来适合种油料作物，过去人们怕销不出去，谁都不愿意多种，大家都有个小打算，只要够自己一年吃和点灯就算了。经过这回参观，我才知道这些东西，不仅是咱们工业上的必需原料，同时还能出口，多种这些东西对国家有很大的利益。
    从这个展览会上，我学到了不少东西，这次回去，第一、要把我在大会上所看到的和听到的，告诉给村里每一个人；同时我要做到走到那里宣传到那里，使更多的人知道这次展览会上的情形、懂得我所懂得的道理。
    第二、一定要大量地推广新式农具，我村已经有了三个七吋步犁，只是太少了。这次回去，一定向大家宣传，再买几架新式步犁，可能的话，全村再买一个铡草机。
    第三、我们要大量供给工业原料和粮食。就像这次在工农联欢会上喊的口号一样，“巩固工农联盟，发展农业生产”。
