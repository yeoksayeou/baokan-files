    Liu Shangwen Arrogantly Suppresses Mass Criticism
    Should Be Subject to Disciplinary Action by the State and the Party
    Editor's Note: After the "Party Life" column on page three of this newspaper published the article "Communist Party Member Liu Shangwen and Others Suppress Mass Criticism" on October 16th, many readers sent letters expressing their opinions. Excerpts are published below:
    I feel that Liu Shangwen's mistake is intolerable and completely violates the Party's principles of democracy and the style of criticism and self-criticism. I have not yet heard of the final disposition of Liu Shangwen's error by the Disciplinary Inspection Commission of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. I believe that Liu Shangwen should not only be subject to Party disciplinary action, but also to state legal sanctions. Otherwise, the masses' accusations and exposure of cadres' mistakes may become less and less.
    Reader Zhang Qiao
    The reason why Communist Party member Liu Shangwen so arrogantly suppresses criticism is because he only proceeds from personal interests. Therefore, he adopted a retaliatory attitude towards comrades who criticized him, while ignoring the counterattacks of reactionary landlords and rich peasants. This behavior of failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and losing one's position should be subject to Party disciplinary action.
    Reader Shi Ruxiang
    Listening to mass criticism and opinions is a good style of Communist Party members. However, Liu Shangwen adopted an arrogant and retaliatory attitude towards mass criticism, arbitrarily expelling the critic, Wang Chengrong, from the Party. After struggling against Wang Chengrong, he sent him to prison for three months. Treating his own comrades with the methods used to deal with the enemy—where is the comradely attitude in that? This is a reflection of exploiting class ideology invading the Party. Therefore, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should seriously deal with Liu Shangwen's problem. In addition, Rong Xiangde, the Secretary of the Meng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, should also be punished.

    刘尚文蛮横压制群众批评
    应受国家和党的纪律处分
    编者按：十月十六日本报三版“党的生活”栏，发表了“共产党员刘尚文等压制群众批评”一文后，不少读者来信提出自己的意见，现择要发表如下：
    我感到刘尚文的错误是不能容忍的，是完全违背了党的民主原则和批评与自我批评作风的。我还没有听到中共山西省委纪律检查委员会对刘尚文的错误作最后处理。我认为刘尚文不仅应受到党的纪律的制裁，而且应该受到国家法律的制裁。否则，群众对干部所犯错误的控告与揭发，可能越来越少。
    读者  张桥
    共产党员刘尚文，所以这样蛮横压制批评，是因为他只从个人利益出发，所以对批评他的同志，采取了打击的态度；而对反动地主和富农的反攻，却放任不管。这种敌我界线不分，丧失立场的行为，应受到党的纪律处分。
    读者  石汝祥
    听取群众的批评与意见，是共产党员的优良作风。但刘尚文对群众的批评，却采取了蛮横报复的态度，擅自开除批评者王承荣的党籍。斗争王承荣后，又把他送进监牢三个月之久。用对待敌人的办法，来对待自己同志。这那里是同志的态度？这是剥削阶级思想侵入到党内来的反映。因此中共山西省委应该严肃处理刘尚文的问题。另外中共盂县县委书记戎祥德也应受到处分。
