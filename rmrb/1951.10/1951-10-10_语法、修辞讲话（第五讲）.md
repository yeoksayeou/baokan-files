Grammar and Rhetoric Talks (Lecture 5)
Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi

Section Four: Ambiguity

Two interpretations, one correct and one incorrect. When we speak carelessly, we often make a sentence have two possible interpretations. Sometimes, it is obvious that only one of these two interpretations is correct. Although this may not affect the reader's understanding, it forces him to guess, causing unnecessary loss of time and energy.

(1) To translate Zhao Shuli's works into foreign languages, it is necessary to
　　　use appropriate language to translate; otherwise, the translated work will not
　　　be the author's original form. (Journal)
(2) A cream-colored and crimson tram sped past.
　　　(Composition)
(3) A child was standing on one side, looking very young.
　　　(Composition)
(4) Because it was winter, I didn't see any cultivation, only
　　　the autumn harvest. (Journal)
(5) There are forty-nine district representatives, and women representatives account for twenty-one of them.
　　　(Journal)
(6) The small house is divided into two rooms. The living room and kitchen are connected. The other room, with the door closed, is clearly a bedroom. (Draft)
(7) A meeting of student parents and mothers from various schools was held. (Journal)
(8) In these few days, our bodies and minds have gained a lot, and our weight has been increasing day by day (the highest reaching five kilograms), and our spirits are very happy. (Newspaper)

(1) "The translated work" can refer to the original work or the translation, but from the whole sentence, it naturally refers to the translation. It should say "the work that is translated out." (2) It makes people suspect that there are two trams because it is not clear that it is one tram painted in two colors. The word "and" should be changed to "with." (3) "A child was standing on one side" makes people suspect there are two children, but there is actually only one. Changing "on one side" to "next to" will not cause misunderstanding. (4) "Autumn harvest" seems to refer to the situation of the autumn harvest. However, in winter, you cannot see the autumn harvest; you see the "products of the autumn harvest." (5) The reader may regard district representatives and women representatives as two different identities of representatives. In fact, women representatives are also district representatives. The word "Among them" should be added at the beginning of the second clause, and the word "representatives" below can be omitted. (6) "The living room and kitchen are connected" can be interpreted as the living room and kitchen are adjacent, or it can be interpreted as the living room also serving as the kitchen. The previous statement "divided into two rooms" shows that the second interpretation is correct. It should say "One room is the living room and kitchen, and the other room..." (7) It can be interpreted as "student parents' meeting" and "mothers' meeting", but in reality, this must be two-in-one. It should be changed to "'Mothers' Meeting' (Student Parents' Meeting)." (8) It is very likely to mislead people into thinking that the maximum daily increase is five kilograms, which is certainly not the case. "Day by day" should be changed to "all have."

Two interpretations are possible. This error is more serious than the previous one because both interpretations make sense, and the reader has no way of knowing your true intention.

(9) The reason why we can have these gains is that, in addition to the efforts of the leadership and
　　　the conscious demands of the workers, inspection teams of four people were organized in each class to conduct inspections and supervision during reading time. (Book)
(10) The entire canal has now been surveyed for one hundred and forty-four li. (Newspaper)
(11) Regardless of the actual situation and the insufficient level of individual members... (Journal)
(12) Only a very few translations can truly translate the consistency of the original work's style and language. (Journal)

(9) It may be that each class organizes a four-person inspection team, or it may be that all classes jointly organize a four-person inspection team. (10) How long is the entire canal? If the total length is one hundred and forty-four li, then it should say "The entire canal is one hundred and forty-four li long and has now been surveyed." If one hundred and forty-four li is only part of the entire canal, then it should say "The entire canal has now been surveyed for one hundred and forty-four li." (11) The ambiguity is: (A) "Regardless of the actual situation" and "the individual members' level is still insufficient," (B) Regardless of "the actual situation and individual members' level" still being insufficient. (12) The ambiguity is: (A) The original work's "style" and "language" are consistent, (B) The translated work's "style and language" are consistent with the original work's "style and language."

Ambiguity of additional components.

(13) Under the current circumstances, mutual assistance is a good way to solve some of the difficulties of pregnant women. (Journal)
(14) Organized mass forces were used to coordinate and carry out unorganized mass work. (Journal)

(13) "Pregnant women's part" can be regarded as a unit, or "part of the difficulties" can be regarded as a unit. According to the tone of the whole sentence, the second interpretation is naturally correct, then a "的" should be added after "pregnant women." (14) The situation is the same. "的" should be added after both "mass" (the second clause is still inappropriate and should be changed to "carry out work among unorganized masses").

(15) Overcome the main shortcomings of bureaucracy and formalism in our work. (Journal)
(16) At present, in East China, Central South China, and Northwest China, except for Fujian, Guangdong, and parts of western Hunan, the bandits have been basically eliminated. (Journal)

(15) "Bureaucracy" and "formalism" seem to be adjuncts to "main shortcomings". In fact, the former and the latter are two-in-one. "Main shortcomings" is the head noun, and "bureaucracy" and "formalism" are its appositives. "的" cannot be used to connect the head noun and appositive (see Section 5 of Lecture 1). "的" should be changed to "etc." (16) also has two interpretations: (A) Part of the "Fujian, Guangdong, and western Hunan" areas (the relationship between adjunct and the modified noun), (B) "Fujian, Guangdong, and western Hunan" is equal to "parts of the area" (the relationship between appositive and head noun). If it is (A), then a "的" should be added before "parts". If it is (B), it is best to change "parts" to "etc." to avoid misunderstanding.

(17) The French government, following the will of the American aggressors, is frantically
　　　carrying out military expansion and war preparations, stepping up the attack on the Vietnamese people, and selling out
　　　the interests of the French people by signing the Schuman Plan treaty, agreeing that the
　　　crimes of the United States arming West Germany are already well known. (Newspaper)
The reader cannot figure out how long the adjunct to "crimes" is. Does it start from "following" or from "American"? It is probably from "following", then it is best to raise this long adjunct to an extrapositional component, and add a head component, saying "...agreed to the United States arming West Germany, these crimes are already well known." The adjunct in many sentences can be changed to this format.

(18) The Chinese people, the geniuses who created this art, have the right to be proud. (Journal)
     "Who created this art's" and "genius'" are two parallel adjuncts, but it is very likely to be mistaken for "who created this art's genius'" is an adjunct (then the object of "create" is not "art" but "genius"). It is best to separate these parallel adjuncts with commas.

For an example of ambiguity caused by improper arrangement of word order in an adjunct, see Section 5 of Lecture 4.

Two things mixed together.

(19) They sped away in two dark blue and silver-gray cars. (Draft)
(20) People who used to learn to write often liked to add a general introduction or summary to the beginning or end of their works. (Draft)
(21) Protection and reform of cultural relics, libraries and museums. (Newspaper, Title)

(19) It can be interpreted as two cars of the same color (dark blue and silver-gray), or it can be interpreted as one dark blue car and one silver-gray car. The author's intention is naturally the latter, so maybe he said this to write two fewer characters. But in this case, you can't just seek conciseness; to avoid confusion, it is best to say it separately. (Example 2 in this section is the opposite of this example, which can be compared.) (20) means "add a general introduction at the beginning and a summary at the end", but literally it should be interpreted as "add a general introduction or summary at the beginning, or add a general introduction or summary at the end". We will not have this misunderstanding because the four words "beginning", "end", "general introduction", and "summary" only have two ways of matching. "Beginning" will not have "summary", and "end" will not have "general introduction". If it is replaced with other words that can be matched with each other, this interpretation is very likely. For example, (21), there are three subjects and two predicates, which can have many ways of matching, and the real meaning is not as obvious as the previous example. According to our guess, the original meaning of this sentence should be "protection of cultural relics and reform of libraries and museums". The number of words in the two statements is the same, but there is a big difference between clear and unclear.

Leading the reader astray. The above are all examples of two possible interpretations in the words. There is also a situation where there is no ambiguity in the words, but the author's true meaning is different from the literal meaning. If you follow the literal meaning, you will go astray. For example:

(22) Soon the People's Republic of China was established, the Common Program was promulgated, and women were legally equal. (Journal)
Literally, it means "women are legally equal to each other", but in reality, the author means "women and men are legally equal".

(23) According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture: annual livestock disease losses are 250 million, insect diseases are 1 billion, and weeds are 3 billion U.S. dollars. Disease losses are the highest in the world, so there is no need to mention them. Scholars believe that these figures are still too low. (Journal)
"Believe that these figures are still too low" seems to mean that the losses are not big enough, and it is best to lose more. The real intention is "Scholars believe that the actual number is higher than this statistic."

(24) Creating the breach of the Zhengzhou Garden, directly submerged thirteen counties in Henan and Anhui provinces with more than 6.19 million people. (Teaching)
(25) It has been three years since my father passed away. In the dozen or so years that my father was alive, there was no deep love between our father and son. (Composition)

(24) Literally, all 6.19 million people were drowned. The author's true intention should be "directly submerged thirteen counties in Henan and Anhui provinces with a population of more than 6.19 million." (25) How could my father only be alive for a dozen or so years? I'm afraid it is "in the dozen or so years before my father's death" or "in the dozen or so years that I spent with my father".

(26) And stated that Britain and France should bear full responsibility for the situation that has already been created. (Journal)
(27) Caution is of course necessary, but there must also be a limit. Since the guests have come to my house, then I am responsible for them. I do not associate with suspicious people. (Newspaper)
Logically speaking, we can only be responsible for people, not for things. But sayings like "He is not responsible for his work" are now very popular, so (26) cannot be considered wrong. But "be responsible for someone" can never be said "be responsible to someone" because the meanings of these two sentences are different and cannot be confused. (27) is making this mistake. The "对" should be changed to "替," or "I am responsible if anything happens to them".

(28) Everyone knows that only the Soviet Union sending troops to Northeast China could make
　　　Japan surrender, but American imperialism says it was the power of the atomic bomb. (Journal)
(29) It is necessary to pass through the people's representative conferences at all levels so that the people know the importance of disaster relief and mobilize the masses for a wave of production for self-relief. And in the same district, representatives from severely affected villages, lightly affected villages, or non-affected villages all come to the meeting and can go back and play a role in promoting the work. (Book)
These two sentences have tonal issues. (28) is a hypothetical tone, but what it says is not hypothetical, but a fact. It should say "Because the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China, Japan surrendered." (29) is the opposite. What the last sentence says seems to be an accomplished fact, but it is actually just the method proposed by the author. It should be changed to "... should all send representatives to the meeting and let them go back to promote the work." (End of this section, the entire text is not finished)

    语法、修辞讲话（第五讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第四段    歧义
    两种解释一正一误。    我们说话不小心的时候，常常会使一句话有两种解释的可能。这两种解释，有时候显然是只有一个是对的。这虽然不至于影响读者的了解，可是要他猜测一番，已经使他的时间和精神受到不必要的损失。
    （一）要把赵树理的作品译成外国文字，一定要
        用适当的语言来翻译，否则所翻的作品就不
        是作者的面貌。（期）
    （二）一辆乳黄和深红色的电车飞驰过去。
        （作）
    （三）一边站着一个孩子，看来年纪还很小。
        （作）
    （四）因为是冬季，没有看到耕种的情形，只看
        到秋季的收获。（期）
    （五）区代表四十九人，妇女代表倒占了二十一
        人。（期）
    （六）小屋分成两间，客堂和厨房连在一起，另
        一间关上了门的房间显然是卧室。（稿）
    （七）召开了各校学生家长妈妈会。（期）
    （八）在这几天里，我们的身体和精神都有很
        大的收获，体重逐日增加（最高的达五公
        斤），精神非常愉快。（报）（一）“所翻的作品”可以指原作，也可以指译文，但从整句看，自然是指译文，该说“翻出来的作品”。（二）使人怀疑是两辆电车，因为没有说清楚是一辆电车漆了两种颜色。“和”字应改为“间”字。（三）“一边站着一个孩子”，让人疑心有两个孩子，其实只有一个。把“一边”改做“旁边”，就不会引起误解了。（四）“秋季的收获”，似乎是指秋季的收获情形。但是冬季里看不到秋季的收获情形，看到的是“秋季的收获物”。（五）读者可能把区代表和妇女代表看成两种身份不同的代表，其实妇女代表也是区代表，第二分句前头要加上“其中”二字，下面“代表”二字可省。（六）“客堂和厨房连在一起”可以解释是客堂和厨房相接，也可以解释是客堂兼做厨房。前面说“分成两间”，可见第二种解释是正确的，应该说“一间是客堂兼厨房，另一间……”。（七）可能解释成“学生家长会”和“妈妈会”，但实际上这一定是二而一的东西。应该改做“‘妈妈会’（学生家长会）”。（八）很可能使人误会是逐日增加的量最高有五公斤，这当然不是事实。应该把“逐日”改做“都有”。
    两种解释都可能。这种错误比前一种更严重，因为两种解释都讲得通，读者就无从知道你的真意所在。
    （九）所以能有这些收获，除去领导上的努力及
        工友们的自觉要求外，并在各个班以四个人
        组织了检查小组，在读报时间进行检查和督
        促。（书）
    （十）现全渠已勘测完毕一百四十四华里。（报）
    （十一）不管实际情况及个别成员水平的还不
        够……（期）
    （十二）其中只有极少数的译作能真正译出原作
        的风格和语言的一致性。（期）
    （九）可能是每班组织一个四人检查小组，也可能是各班共同组织一个四人检查小组。（十）全渠究竟有多长？如果全长一百四十四华里，那么该说 “全渠一百四十四华里，现已勘测完毕”；如果一百四十四华里只是全渠的一部分，那么该说“现全渠已勘测了一百四十四华里”。（十一）的歧义是：（甲）“不管实际情况”及“个别成员的水平还不够”，（乙）不管“实际情况及个别成员水平”的还不够。（十二）的歧义是：（甲）原作的“风格”和“语言”一致，（乙）译作的“风格和语言”和原作的“风格和语言”一致。
    附加成分的歧义。
    （十三）在现有情况下，互助是可以解决孕妇部
        分困难的好办法。（期）
    （十四）运用了有组织的群众力量，配合开展了
        无组织的群众工作。（期）
    （十三）可以把“孕妇部分”看做一个单位，也可以把“部分困难”看做一个单位，根据全句语气看，自然第二种解释是正确的，那么应该在“孕妇”之后加一个“的”字。（十四）的情形也一样，两个“群众”之后都要加“的”字（第二分句仍不妥，应改为“在无组织的群众中展开工作”）。
    （十五）克服我们工作中的官僚主义、形式主义
        的主要缺点。（期）
    （十六）现华东、中南、西北除福建、两广、湘
        西部分地区外，股匪业已基本肃清。（期）
    （十五）“官僚主义”“形式主义”似乎是“主要缺点”的附加语，事实上前者跟后者是二而一，“主要缺点”是本位语，“官僚主义”“形式主义”是它的同位语。本位语与同位语之间是不能用“的”字连接的（参看第一讲第五段），“的”字应改做“等”。（十六）也有两种解释：（甲）“福建、两广、湘西”的部分地区（附加语与被附加语的关系），（乙）“福建、两广、湘西”等于“部分地区”（同位语与本位语的关系）。如果是（甲），就该在“部分”之前加一个“的”字，如果是（乙），最好把“部分”改做“等”，免得发生误会。
    （十七）法国政府遵从美国侵略者的意旨，疯狂
        进行扩军备战，加紧进攻越南人民，并出卖
        法国人民利益签订舒曼计划条约，同意美国
        武装西德的罪行已是人所共知的了。（报）读者弄不清楚“罪行”的附加语到底有多长，是从“遵从”起，还是从“美国”起？恐怕是从“遵从”起，那么最好把这个长附加语提作外位成分，另外补出一个本位成分来，说“……同意美国武装西德，这些罪行已是人所共知的了”。很多句子里的附加语都可以改成这样的格式。
    （十八）创造了这种艺术的天才的中国人民，是
        有权骄傲的。（期）
     “创造了这种艺术的”跟“天才的”是两个并列的附加语，但是很可能让人误认“创造了这种艺术的天才的”是一个附加语（那么“创造”的宾语不是
    “艺术”而是“天才”了）。这类并列的附加语最好用顿号隔开。
    由于附加语里词的次序安排不当而引起歧义的例子，看第四讲第五段。
    两事混杂。
    （十九）就分乘两辆深蓝的和银灰的小汽车疾驶
        而去。（稿）
    （二十）从前学习写作的人往往喜欢在作品的开
        头或末尾加上一个总冒或总结。（稿）
    （二一）文物与图书馆、博物馆的保护与改革。
        （报，标题）
    （十九）可以解释为两辆颜色一样（深蓝间银灰）的汽车，也可以解释为一辆深蓝和一辆银灰的汽车。作者的意思自然是后者，所以这样说，也许是为了少写两个字。但是在这种情形之下，不能只求简炼；为了避免含混，最好分开来说。（本段例二刚好跟这个例子相反，可以比较。）（二十）的意思是“在开头加一个总冒，在末尾加一个总结”，可是照字面讲是应该讲做“在开头加上一个总冒或总结，或是在末尾加上一个总冒或总结”的。我们不会有这种误解，是因为“开头”“末尾”“总冒”
    “总结”四个词只有两种搭配的方式，“开头”不会有“总结”，“末尾”也不会有“总冒”。若是换成别的，可以互相搭配的词，这种解释就是很可能的了。如（二一），主语有三项，谓语有两项，能有很多种搭配的方式，而真正的意思是什么就不像上一例那样可以一望而知。照我们的猜测，这句话的原意该是“文物的保护与图书馆、博物馆的改革”。两种说法字数一样，但是清楚与否，却大有分别。
    把读者引入歧途。以上所举，都是字面上有两种可能的解释的例子。还有一种情形，字面上并无歧义，但是作者的真意跟字面上的意思不同。如果照字面讲，就要深入歧途。例如：
    （二二）不久中华人民共和国成立了，共同纲领
        颁布了，妇女在法律上是平等了。（期）从字面上看，是说“妇女彼此之间在法律上平等”，实际上作者是说“妇女和男子在法律上平等”。
    （二三）据美国农业部统计：每年牲畜病损失二
        五亿，虫病十亿，野草三十亿美元。病害损
        失甲于全球，不必多提。学者们认为这些数
        字还太低。（期） “认为这些数字还太低”，似乎是说损失还不够大，最好再多损失一些，真意却是“学者们认为实际数目比这个统计还高”。
    （二四）制造郑州花园决口，直接淹没豫皖两省
        十三个县六百十九万多人口。（教）
    （二五）父亲去世忽忽已经三年。父亲在世的十
        几年中，我们父子间并无深厚的爱。（作）
    （二四）照字面看，这六百十九万人都淹死了。作者的真意该是“直接淹没豫皖两省拥有六百十九万多人口的十三个县”。（二五）父亲在世怎么会只有十几年？恐怕是“父亲去世前的十几年中”，或是“我和父亲相处的十几年中”。
    （二六）并声明英法应对业已造成的情势负全部
        责任。（期）
    （二七）谨慎当然要谨慎，可是也得有个分寸。
        既然客人是到我家来，那末我就对他们负
        责。可疑的人我是不结交的。（报）按理说，我们只能对人负责，不能对事物负责。但是像“他对工作不负责”之类的说法现在已经很流行了，因此（二六）不能算错。但是“替某人负责”，决不能说“对某人负责”，因为这两句话的意思不一样，不能混同。（二七）正是犯了这个错误，应该把“对”字改做“替”字，或者说“他们有什么，有我负责”。
    （二八）谁都知道，唯有苏联出兵东北，才能使
        日本投降，而美帝国主义却说是原子弹的力
         量。（期）
    （二九）必须通过各界人民代表会议，使人民都
        知道救灾的重要，发动群众的生产自救热
        潮。而同一区重灾村与轻灾村或是非灾村都
        有代表来开会，都能回去起推动工作的作
        用。（书）这两句话的语气有毛病。（二八）是假定语气，但所说的并非假定，而是事实。应该说“因为苏联出兵东北，日本才投降的”。（二九）正相反，最后一句所说好像是既成事实，其实只是作者提出的办法。应改做“……都应该派代表来开会，让他们回去推动工作”。（本段完，全文未完）
