    解放军和志愿军战斗英雄代表团
    在首都曾向四十余万人民进行报告
    日内将分别返回战斗岗位及赴国内各地作报告
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表团在首都进行的报告活动已经结束。解放军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表团除一部分留北京续有工作外，将于日内启程返部，向部队传达他们参加国庆大典的观感。志愿军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表团中一部分代表，也将于日内返回朝鲜前线，向战友们传达在祖国所见到的人民力量空前强大与人民对他们欢迎和热爱的情形；一部分代表应各地抗美援朝总分会和人民解放军之请，将分赴国内各地向各地人民和部队作报告。
    自十月十二日至十七日，解放军与志愿军战斗英雄代表们在北京市抗美援朝分会和中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部的统一组织下，出席了一百二十二场盛大的报告会，四十余万人民听到了报告。自四月普及深入抗美援朝运动和五月中国人民赴朝慰问团向首都各界人民作报告后，这是又一次规模巨大的抗美援朝宣传教育活动。解放军和志愿军战斗英雄们报告后，北京各界人民纷纷以检查爱国公约、加紧增产、热烈捐献等实际行动来作为回答。
