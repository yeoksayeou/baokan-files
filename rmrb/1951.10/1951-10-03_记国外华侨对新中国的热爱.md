    The founding of the People's Republic of China brought new joy to the more than ten million overseas Chinese compatriots. The era when overseas Chinese were called "overseas orphans" has ended, and they have an independent and strong motherland. They deeply love such a motherland.

    On October 1, 1949, the day New China was born, in the suburbs of Saigon, Vietnam, in a detention center used by French imperialists to imprison patriotic overseas Chinese, a solemn and magnificent five-star red flag was proudly hung. The imprisoned compatriots held a celebration meeting under the red flag to celebrate the birth of New China, singing the magnificent new national anthem. In a concentration camp in Malaya, overseas Chinese compatriots, who were unreasonably detained by British imperialists, risked the danger of military police torture and beatings, also made a huge red flag on this day and raised it in the high sky of the concentration camp, with the words: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" When the compatriots saw this new flag, they felt as if they had seen the light of the motherland, feeling warmth and comfort.

    In the past two years, the motherland has progressed, consolidated, and developed rapidly; the unity and progress of overseas Chinese in various places has also risen and developed along with it. The motherland's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has further promoted fundamental changes in the thinking of overseas Chinese in various places. Since the beginning of this year, more than 90% of overseas Chinese in various places have generally hung the five-star national flag. Mao Zedong's works and other theoretical and literary books of New China have been warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese intellectuals and youth in Southeast Asia. Last year, on National Day, overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Foreign Minister Zhou to congratulate them on National Day and expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement protesting against U.S. imperialism's aggression against China's territory of Taiwan and the bombing of Northeast China.

    Many overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese organizations in Southeast Asia have written letters to express their condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Korean front, paying tribute to the soldiers on the Sino-Korean front. In February of this year, 36 overseas Chinese organizations in Sumatra wrote letters to the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers, respectively, to pay their respects. It said, "Due to the just actions and victorious results of our volunteer army and the Korean People's Army, we feel the glory of being Chinese today." Overseas Chinese in a certain place in Malaya said in a letter of condolence: "We are indignant at the British imperialists' barbaric and unreasonable persecution of our overseas Chinese compatriots, and we are always concerned about the newborn motherland. We are always concerned about the volunteer comrades who are defending the motherland and world peace." In March, 210 overseas Chinese who returned from Thailand donated 2,500 Thai baht on the ship to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's troops. Fang Junzhuang, editor-in-chief of the Penang Modern Daily, who was persecuted and returned from Malaya, donated all of his remaining pocket money to comfort the People's Volunteers on the day he entered the country.

    Many overseas Chinese in Burma and Thailand automatically launched a campaign last year to resolutely refuse to watch poisonous films (American movies) and not buy American goods. In Indonesia, overseas Chinese's refusal to watch poisonous films is even more common. Some overseas Chinese have also issued signed letters to express their determination. When the vicious propaganda film "The Steel Helmet," which insulted the Chinese and Korean people, was shipped to Jakarta for screening, it immediately aroused angry protests from overseas Chinese, resulting in the film being unable to be screened in many cities in Indonesia. In contrast, overseas Chinese love New China's films. Last November, when New China's first documentary film, "The Birth of New China," was first screened in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, it was watched by more than 36,000 people. Many overseas Chinese also came from Sukabumi, more than 130 miles away from Jakarta, to watch it. Every time Chairman Mao, the five-star national flag, and the heroic posture of the People's Liberation Army appeared on the screen, the overseas Chinese responded with thunderous applause and cheers. The film "Zhao Yiman" was also warmly welcomed by the local overseas Chinese when it was screened in the capital of Burma last December.

    Every victory of the motherland's people on the anti-US front and the construction front makes the vast number of overseas Chinese cheer and be encouraged, and at the same time further enhances the overseas Chinese's understanding of the motherland and strengthens the overseas Chinese's confidence. Overseas Chinese feel gratified and proud of the motherland's unprecedentedly improved international status. For example, when General Wu Xiuquan made a righteous accusation against the United States' aggression against Taiwan at the United Nations General Assembly last November, overseas Chinese in various places cheered and supported it unanimously. The principal of a Chinese school in the interior of Thailand said after reading the full text of General Wu Xiuquan's speech at the United Nations General Assembly: "This indictment described the crimes of U.S. imperialism's aggression against our China so thoroughly and vividly. After reading this indictment, I realized that today's China is truly strong! It is truly decent and glorious to be a people of New China!" Due to the influence of this report, overseas Chinese in the United States have generally publicly stated that they would rather be imprisoned in concentration camps than be driven by U.S. imperialism to go to Korea to serve as cannon fodder in its war of aggression.

    The rapid progress of domestic construction in various aspects has made overseas Chinese generally feel that the liberated motherland is closely related to the vital interests of overseas Chinese. The communication of remittances, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the eradication of bandits have ensured the tranquility of the lives of overseas Chinese dependents; returned overseas Chinese who have been persecuted have received relief and are well-placed; overseas Chinese students returning to China have unlimited prospects for enrollment and employment, and overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have unlimited prospects for returning to China to invest. Therefore, overseas Chinese in various places are circulating letters everywhere, sharing good news with each other, and exposing the conspiracies of the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and a few landlords and bullies who fled abroad to sabotage land reform and sabotage the motherland. The resolute struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's special agents' crimes of betraying the country and harming overseas Chinese has further deepened and expanded the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese in various places.

    记国外华侨对新中国的热爱
    新华社记者  方力
    中华人民共和国的成立，给一千多万居留海外的华侨同胞带来了新的喜悦。侨胞们被称为“海外孤儿”的时代已告结束，他们有了独立和强大的祖国。他们深深地热爱这样的祖国。
    一九四九年十月一日，新中国诞生的那一天，越南西贡的近郊，法帝国主义用来囚禁爱国华侨的一个拘留所里，一面庄严灿烂的五星红旗，骄傲地悬挂起来了。狱中的侨胞在红旗下举行了庆祝新中国诞生的大会，唱着雄壮的新国歌。在马来亚的某一个集中营里，被英帝国主义无理拘禁的侨胞，冒着军警毒刑殴打的危险，也在这一天制成一面巨大的红旗，升起在集中营中的高空，旗上面写着：“中华人民共和国万岁！”侨胞们看到这面新的旗帜，就如同看到了祖国的光芒，感到了温暖和慰籍。
    两年来祖国进步了，巩固了，飞跃地发展了；海外华侨的团结进步也水涨船高，跟着向前发展了。祖国人民的抗美援朝运动，更促成了国外各地侨胞思想上的根本变化。今年以来，各地百分之九十以上的侨胞，普遍地悬挂五星国旗了。毛主席著作和其他新中国的理论、文艺书籍，受到了东南亚各地各界侨胞知识青年的热烈欢迎。去年国庆，东南亚各地侨胞，纷纷写信给毛主席、周外长祝贺国庆，并表示坚决拥护周外长抗议美帝国主义侵略中国领土台湾及轰炸东北的严正声明。
    东南亚各地的许多侨胞和侨团，纷纷写信慰问在朝鲜前线的我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，向中朝前线将士致敬。今年二月，苏门答腊有三十六个侨团分别写信给中朝人民将士致敬。其中说：“由于我志愿军及朝鲜人民军的正义行动及所获得的胜利战果，已使我们感到今天做中国人的荣耀。”马来亚某地侨胞在慰问信中说：“我们愤恨英帝国主义对我侨胞的野蛮无理的迫害，时刻关心着新生的祖国。时刻关心着保卫祖国和世界和平的志愿军同志们。”三月间，从泰国回国的侨胞二百一十人，在船上即捐献了泰币二千五百铢，慰劳中朝人民部队。由马来亚被迫害归国的槟榔屿现代日报总编辑方君壮，在进入国门的当天，就把他剩余的零用钱也全部捐献慰劳人民志愿军。
    缅甸、泰国的许多侨胞，去年自动地发起坚决拒看毒片（美国电影）、不买美货。在印尼，华侨拒看毒片，更为普遍。有些侨胞为此还发签名书表示决心。当美国侮辱中朝人民的恶毒宣传片《血战全韩》运到雅加达准备放映时，立即引起侨胞们的愤怒抗议，结果使这部毒片在印尼的许多城市无法放映。与此相反，侨胞们却热爱新中国的影片。去年十一月，当新中国的第一部记录片《新中国的诞生》在印尼首都雅加达首次放映时，观众达三万六千多人。很多华侨还从远离雅城一百三十余英里的苏甲巫眉城赶来观看。当银幕上每次出现毛主席、五星国旗和人民解放军的雄姿时，侨胞们都报以如雷的掌声和欢呼声。名片《赵一曼》去年十二月在缅甸首都放映时，亦受到当地华侨热烈的欢迎。
    祖国人民在抗美战线和建设战线上的每一胜利，都使广大侨胞们欢呼鼓舞，同时亦更进一步提高了侨胞们对祖国的认识，更加强侨胞的信心。侨胞们对祖国在国际上的地位空前提高，感到快慰，感到骄傲。例如，去年十一月伍修权将军在联合国大会上提出对于美国侵略台湾的正义控诉时，各地侨胞一致欢呼拥护。泰国内地某一家华侨学校校长，读了伍修权将军在联合国大会上的发言全文后说：“这篇控诉词把美帝国主义侵略我们中国的罪行，说得真够痛快淋漓，看到这篇控诉，才知道今天的中国是真正强大起来了！做一个新中国人民真体面、真光荣！”由于这一报告的影响，我留美侨胞普遍地公开表示：宁愿被关入集中营，也不供美帝国主义驱使，赴朝鲜充当其侵略战争的炮灰。
    国内各方面建设的突飞猛进，使国外侨胞已普遍感到解放后的祖国与华侨的切身利益关系密切。沟通侨汇、土地改革、镇压反革命和肃清土匪，使侨眷生活安宁获得保证；被迫害归国难侨获得救济与各得其所；归国华侨学生升学及就业，华侨工商业的回国投资等，前途均无限广阔。所以国外各地侨胞，到处传阅来信，互相报喜，揭破流亡国外的蒋匪帮残余及少数地主恶霸破坏土地改革、破坏祖国的阴谋。对蒋匪帮特务卖国害侨罪行的坚决斗争，更使各地华侨的爱国团结日益深入与扩大。
