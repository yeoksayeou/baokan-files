Editor's Note: Beijing citizen Shan Zijing wrote to this newspaper on June 19th, requesting our assistance in resolving the issue of his wrongful arrest by the Beijing Public Security Bureau due to sharing the same name and hometown as a counter-revolutionary element. This matter has now been satisfactorily resolved. The details of the incident and its resolution are published below.

The Course of Shan Zijing's Wrongful Arrest

On March 27th of this year, Shan Zijing, a citizen residing at 27 Wai Si Nan Heng Street, Beijing, was arrested by the Wai Si Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. During interrogation, Shan Zijing steadfastly denied committing any crime and requested the interrogators to conduct further investigation. Subsequently, Shan Zijing was sent to his hometown, Huang County, Shandong Province, for processing. The Huang County Public Security Bureau's investigation proved that Shan Zijing had been wrongfully arrested and released him. Shan Zijing, having been detained for two months, experienced disruption to his small business and therefore requested the government to compensate him for his material, psychological, and reputational losses. He also wrote to this newspaper requesting assistance in resolving this issue. This newspaper immediately sent a letter to the relevant departments to inquire, which confirmed that citizen Shan Zijing's statement was consistent with the facts. After receiving Shan Zijing's letter forwarded by this newspaper, the Beijing Public Security Bureau immediately conducted a serious and conscientious handling of this matter. On September 1st, citizen Shan Zijing wrote to this newspaper for the second time, expressing his gratitude for the government's responsible spirit.

Citizen Shan Zijing's Letter

To the Editors:

I received your reply on July 4th. On July 26th, comrades Gao and Zhang from the Wai Si Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau came to my home to apologize. Two days later, my section (Section 9) notified me to go to the branch bureau. Director Xue personally received me and expressed his condolences. He said that initially, they felt that my materials did not match the case and had doubts, and had discussed it in a meeting, but it was wrong to delay. Finally, he also talked about the issue of losses (including reputation, materials, etc.). I was very moved by this, so I only asked the government to subsidize my material losses. Director Xue immediately agreed. On approximately August 23rd, Director Xue sent Section Chief Cheng to meet with me. In addition to apologizing, he also issued one million yuan to compensate for my material losses. That afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Ninth Police Station convened a mass meeting, explained the government's errors in this work, made an on-the-spot self-criticism, and apologized to me again. My previous understanding of the government was insufficient, and I thought it would be at most a formality, but the result exceeded my expectations. I am very satisfied, and the masses also praised it endlessly. I sincerely thank the government's care and your newspaper's help.

Sincerely,

Shan Zijing

The Beijing Public Security Bureau's Self-Criticism

To the Editors:

The incident of wrongfully arresting citizen Shan Zijing shows that a small number of our bureau's staff still have an impermissible, careless working style. In the work of investigating and arresting counter-revolutionary Shan Zijing (not citizen Shan Zijing), our bureau's Wai Si Branch, upon discovering that there was a person whose name, hometown, and address were indeed the same as the said criminal—namely, citizen Shan Zijing—did not carefully verify the facts of the crime and proceeded with the arrest; this was very wrong. During the interrogation, citizen Shan Zijing requested a re-investigation, but the interrogator only one-sidedly believed that "counter-revolutionaries are cunning" and did not consider it, and did not promptly report to the higher authorities, resulting in the erroneous transfer of Shan Zijing to Huang County, Shandong, after the wrongful arrest.

The incident of wrongfully arresting citizen Shan Zijing also shows that some responsible cadres in our bureau still lack timely and in-depth inspection and a spirit of actively taking responsibility for the people in their work. Otherwise, the incident of wrongfully arresting citizen Shan Zijing could have been avoided or quickly corrected afterward.

We have conducted a strict inspection and self-criticism of the incident of wrongfully arresting citizen Shan Zijing. This error is serious and should arouse the vigilance of all public security personnel in our bureau.

    京市公安局错捕市民单子敬的经过及对这个错误的检讨
    编者按：北京市市民单子敬于六月十九日，致函本报，要求本报帮助解决他因姓名籍贯与一反革命分子相同而被北京市公安局错捕的问题。这问题现已圆满解决。兹将事情经过及处理结果公布如后。
    错捕单子敬的经过
    今年三月二十七日，住北京市外四南横街二十七号市民单子敬为北京市公安局外四分局逮捕。单子敬在审讯中，坚不承认犯罪，并要求审讯员再加调查。之后，单子敬被解至其原籍山东省黄县处理。黄县公安局审讯结果，证明单子敬是被错捕，遂将单子敬释放。单子敬经过两个月的关押，影响了他所经营的小生意，因此要求政府补偿他在物质、精神及名誉上的损失。并致函本报，要求本报帮助他解决这个问题。本报当即致函有关部门查询，证明市民单子敬所述与事实相符。北京市公安局接到本报转去的单子敬的来信后，立即对此事件进行了严肃认真的处理。九月一日，市民单子敬第二次致函本报，对政府这种认真负责的精神表示感谢。
    市民单子敬的来信编辑同志：
    七月四日接到你们的回信。七月二十六日，北京市公安局外四分局派高、张二同志到我家道歉。隔了两天，本段（九段）通知我到分局去。薛分局长亲自接见了我，并慰问了我。他说当初觉得我的材料与案情不符，曾发生怀疑，并开会讨论过，只是不该拖延。最后还谈到了损失问题（包括名誉、物质等等）。我因此很受感动，所以只要求政府补助我物质上的损失。薛分局长立即允诺。大概是八月二十三日吧，薛分局长又派程科长接见了我。除了道歉外，还发给一百万元，弥补我的物质损失。当天下午三时，第九派出所召开了群众会，说明了政府在这一工作中的错误，当场作了检讨，又向我道了歉。我原先对政府的认识不够，以为最多不过走走形式，结果出乎我的意料之外。我很满意，群众也赞叹不已。我衷心感谢政府的照顾与贵社的帮助。
                                              单子敬
    北京市公安局的检讨编辑同志：
    错捕市民单子敬的事件，说明了我局少数工作人员在工作中还存有不能容许的粗枝大叶作风。我局外四分局在查缉反革命犯单子敬（不是市民单子敬）的工作中，当发现与该犯姓名、籍贯、住址确有相同之人——即市民单子敬之后，未再仔细查对犯罪事实，即行逮捕；这是很不对的。在审讯中，市民单子敬要求重新调查，但审讯员只片面地认为“反革命狡猾”，而不加考虑，且未及时向上级报告，致在错捕后又错误地将单子敬解往山东黄县。
    错捕市民单子敬事件还说明了本局某些负责干部在工作中还缺乏及时深入检查和对人民积极负责的精神。否则，错捕市民单子敬事件就可以避免或事后可以很快纠正。
    我们已对错捕市民单子敬事件作了严格的检查和检讨。这一错误是严重的，应引起我局全体公安工作人员的警惕。
                                      北京市公安局
