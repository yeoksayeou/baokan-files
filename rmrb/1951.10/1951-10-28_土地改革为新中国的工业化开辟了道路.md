    Land Reform Paves the Way for the Industrialization of New China
    Ma Dayou, Professor, Peking University

    Land reform is to "abolish the feudal exploitative land ownership of the landlord class and implement the land ownership of the peasants, thereby liberating rural productive forces, developing agricultural production, and paving the way for the industrialization of New China." I deeply realized the correctness of this great decision during my participation in the land reform work in southern Sichuan this time. In my work, I saw great production potential, which greatly strengthened my belief in the future of industrialization.

    The feudal land ownership system severely restricts rural productive forces, making it impossible to develop agricultural production, and national industrialization cannot be carried out. The situation of Qiu Yinzhang, a farmer in Jifeng Village, ×× County, gives us a powerful explanation. Qiu Yinzhang rented a piece of land from landlord Xiong Yangshi, with an annual output of twenty-eight shi of yellow grain (324 jin per shi). According to the tenancy agreement (written in the format officially set by the Kuomintang, with a total of twelve articles), Qiu had to pay ten shi of yellow grain in advance as a deposit in preparation for landlord punishment, and had to pay twenty-two and a half shi of rent annually, plus two dou of bean rent, two hundred bundles of rice straw, twelve obligatory labor days, and obligatory rice milling for the landlord and paying some taxes for the landlord. The last article stipulated that Qiu Yinzhang must not engage in other businesses, and would be punished for violations (New Year's gifts and other "rules" were not written in the tenancy agreement). Under such severe exploitation, farmers could only afford wheat paste and coarse grain paste in good years, and only flee famine and beg for food in famine years. Farmers can only bear this cruel exploitation with anger, otherwise the landlord would take back the land, and they would have no place to live (in rural southern Sichuan, houses come with the land). If the harvest was a little better that year, the landlord would immediately increase the rent and deposit. Not only would the farmers not benefit, but they would suffer. How could they have the interest to develop production? Under the feudal land ownership system, coupled with the oppression of the reactionary government in the past, many farmers became extremely poor (in southern Sichuan, such extremely poor people accounted for 20 percent of the population) and even their families were destroyed. Yin Huizhang of Jifeng Village is a typical example. Yin Huizhang's father was originally a middle peasant tenant. In 1919, he had 150 taels of silver as a deposit and rented 60 shi of land from the landlord Huang family. In less than six years, the deposit was fined to only five taels, and the Yin family was deprived of the tenancy and kicked out. He took the five taels of silver and rented two shi of dry land from another landlord, and life became even more difficult. Later, Yin Huizhang's father had to send one of his daughters out to be a child bride and raised his four brothers, then let them go out to work for the landlord. Yin Huizhang started watching cattle for the landlord at the age of sixteen, earning one dou of rice each year. After more than ten years of such poor life, because his brothers gradually grew up and there was more labor, he saved some money, hoping to rent more land to cultivate. This was when Japanese imperialism was frantically attacking our country. The Kuomintang retreated step by step in the front and arrested strong men in the rear. From December 1936 to September 1937, three of the four brothers were drafted in succession, and there has been no news of them to this day. Yin Huizhang was afraid of being drafted again, so he became a monk under the tutelage of Xiao, and the old man soon died. This family was finished. This is the destination of the working people under the reactionary feudal rule. In fact, it was lucky that Yin Huizhang saved his life, and many farmers said, "If we are not liberated again, we will all be punished to death by the landlords." The feudal land ownership system allows a few parasitic classes to enjoy obscene and shameless pleasures, and allows the absolute majority of farmers to work all year round without getting enough to eat, which greatly hinders the development of production and restricts the industrialization of the country.

    Land reform abolished the unreasonable feudal exploitation system, allowing farmers to enjoy the fruits of their labor for the first time. The land rent, which accounts for more than 70 percent of the harvest, is no longer paid to the landlords, and rural purchasing power will naturally increase greatly. On the other hand, because farmers no longer have to perform labor for the landlords, landlords who did not engage in production in the past will also be forced to participate in labor, and the rural labor force will also be greatly liberated. Taking the situation in southern Sichuan as an example, each farmer can be divided an average of two shi of land in the land reform. If a main laborer bears an average family of five (including himself), his family can be divided ten shi of land. A main laborer can cultivate an average of more than 20 shi of land, so at least half of the labor force can do other work. If we add up the labor force liberated by land reform across the country, the number is astonishing. This part of the agricultural population gradually transforms into the industrial population, and the power is imaginable. In fact, if we count the manpower saved by improving agricultural tools and farming methods, the strength of our industrial production reserve army will be even more abundant. This potential industrial production power is our country's most valuable capital and most reliable guarantee for industrialization.

    What is the quality of our industrial production reserve army? Are our farmers, as imperialist elements have propagandized and some intellectuals have blindly echoed, both poor, weak, and ignorant? If that were the case, more people would only be a burden, and would not be a driving force for industrialization, but a great obstacle. After living and working with the farmers, I deeply realized the absurdity of the malicious slander of imperialist elements, and also realized the greatness and wisdom of the farmers, and established absolute confidence in industrialization.

    After a long period of cruel feudal exploitation and oppression, the poverty of the peasants is self-evident. Taking southern Sichuan as an example, the general land rent is a "rigid rent" (the tenancy agreement states "no shortage of grains in case of drought or flood"), which is about 70% of the yield in a good year. Even in a good year, the remaining grain is not enough to eat, and in case of drought or flood, the total income is not enough to pay the rent. How can farmers not be poor? Many farmers live next to pig pens and cowsheds, and the poverty of their lives is unimaginable to urban people. Grandpa Jin Fuquan of Jifeng Village is already 72 years old this year, and he has almost nothing in his family. A quilt has rotted into strips that cannot be connected together. In summer, to save money, he only wears a pair of shorts. His skin has become accustomed to wind, rain, sun, and insect bites. His greatest luxury is to buy four liang of vegetable oil per month for lighting and eating. Under such extreme poverty, are farmers pessimistic, disappointed, and unwilling to work hard? On the contrary, the industriousness and bravery of the peasants cannot be deterred by any difficulties. The extent of land use is almost extreme. Terraces have been opened up on the mountains all the way to the top of the mountains, and grain has been planted on the ridges and edges of the fields, and even several inches of soil have been laid on the stones to plant sorghum and vegetables. In the family, everyone is engaged in labor, weaving cloth, spinning hemp, making straw sandals, even carrying salt and digging coal (opening earth kilns). Whatever can be done, no matter how difficult it is, someone will do it. Old people and children are not idle either. The peasants use this fearless spirit to fight against nature and overcome the difficulties of life. After the land reform, the two big mountains pressing on the farmers' heads have been overthrown, and no force can stop the farmers from giving full play to their strength and fighting for a better future.

    The wisdom of the peasants is infinite. Before my departure, I also understood the weakness of my ability and knew the principle of relying on the masses, but I always felt that at least my calculation skills were not bad, so I brought a slide rule and embarked on the journey with confidence, ready to show off my skills. When I arrived in southern Sichuan, all I saw were terraces, winding, curved, and strangely shaped. The formulas of rectangles, triangles, and even trapezoids and sectors that I had learned before were useless, and the power of the slide rule could not be used. On the contrary, according to their rich experience, farmers can not only estimate the area based on how much seed can be planted in a field, but also further estimate the yield based on soil color, wind direction, water source, and other conditions. The accuracy of the estimates can be as high as only 1% or 2%, which is something that no expert trained in school can do. During the distribution of land, more than 1,000 people in the village fairly and reasonably divided several thousand pieces of land of different sizes, fertility, and height in one day, without any disputes, and everyone was satisfied. In other work, such as fighting landlords, investigating the situation of landlord production materials, and even collecting confiscations and distributing fruits, the peasants showed unparalleled wisdom. The distribution of fruits can be completely handled according to the degree of poverty and needs. In the land reform, the wisdom of the peasants was given a full opportunity to play for the first time, and thus made amazing achievements.

    After the exercise of land reform, the level of awareness of the peasants has also been greatly improved. More than 70 activists have emerged in Jifeng Village, which has more than 200 households. They serve the masses selflessly, day and night, without delaying their own work, and without complaining. Middle peasant Shen Yukun had to work in the village all day and could not carry out production, so he got up in the middle of the night to work in the fields; poor peasant Zeng Guangcai often could not eat several meals in a row in order to attend meetings, help young people study, and lead children's group activities; poor peasant Lan Shifa, who was over 60 years old, actively participated in all activities like young people, and led the work of checking fields and evaluating production; Armed Minister Qiu Yinzhang (a poor peasant) worked in the village during the day to ensure the security of the village, and went out on patrol at night, and often traveled dozens of miles away day and night. He only missed one day to come to the village in the entire land reform process. The next day, he came to confess and said, "I made a mistake. Yesterday, I went to cut my own grain." - This is a manifestation of high awareness. The work of checking fields and evaluating production took two days in total. In the whole village, 25% of the black fields (paddy fields) and 147% of the black soil (dry land) that had been hidden during the Kuomintang era were found. One group found 52% of the black fields and 289% of the black soil. These gains were mainly the result of self-reporting and public discussion in the group (in the large-scale review, only 4/1000 of the black fields were found). Without the high awareness of the masses, this would be impossible. The spirit of unity and mutual concession was also fully demonstrated in the land distribution work. Not only did people in the village not have any disputes with each other, but more than 200 people from other villages with less land were warmly welcomed to participate in the land distribution and were given special care. This spirit of high class friendship gave me great inspiration. In the struggle against the landlords, the masses' awareness was also fully manifested. In the face-to-face struggle, the peasants demonstrated unparalleled power by fighting with reason and law, completely defeating the landlords, confessing their crimes and paying compensation; in the anti-dispersion movement, after mobilizing the masses, the dispersed property of the landlords recovered in one village was worth more than 100 shi of yellow grain; this great force completely bowed the feudal landlord class.

    The peasants also showed correct understanding when dealing with personal problems. Yin Huizhang, who became a monk to escape being drafted, returned to secular life and got married during the land reform period because he had no faith in religion. What he said to the poor peasant Xu Wenqing (widow) when he proposed marriage was something that many intellectuals could not say: "In the past, the feudal society forced me to become a monk. Now Chairman Mao is here, and I have been liberated, but 'ten fingers can't hold down a few fleas.' No matter how capable a person is, living alone is always hard. I know your temper is not good, but what does it matter? We can often hold criticism meetings. If I'm wrong, you criticize me, and I won't do that next time; if you're wrong, I can also criticize you." Xu Wenqing said: "I am willing to do any work. I just can't stand lazy people." Yin said: "I am the same." After they got married, their relationship was very good and their production was active. The future of this new-style family is infinitely bright. Through Yin Xu's marriage, the local peasants have generally established an understanding of new-style marriage and new-style weddings, and two more couples have successfully solved their marriage problems, which is a powerful promotion for the Marriage Law.

    Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the touching performances of the peasants are endless. I received the education of the "Land Reform University" this time, and my personal gains far exceeded what I learned in the past two years of study. Our contribution is meager. If there are any contributions, the main thing is to further link the Central People's Government with the people. The peasants deeply feel Chairman Mao's concern for them, which greatly increases their determination to "always follow the Communist Party" and sincerely shouts:

    "Don't forget the Communist Party when you turn over, thank Chairman Mao for your happiness." In the process of land reform, through the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and political education, the peasants' understanding of the motherland has also greatly improved, and thus strengthened their love for the motherland. Peasants are now not only vying to join the army, but also to join the Chinese People's Volunteers. When a young peasant is disappointed that he cannot "pass" the exam because his body is unqualified, it is difficult to persuade him. In the increased production and donation, the peasants have a deep understanding of the collective power. Middle peasant Shen Yukun said: "If each of us donates 1,000 yuan, the whole village will have more than one million yuan, and the national donation can buy a lot of planes and cannons to resist US aggression and aid Korea." Therefore, the movement was carried out very enthusiastically. The whole village has pledged a total of 6 million yuan, and more than 3 million yuan has been paid within three days. After the land reform, the peasants urgently demand culture. Many young people want to join the Communist Youth League and hope to join the Communist Party in the future. They wholeheartedly yearn for the bright and brilliant prospects of New China.

    This is our industrial production reserve army; numerous in number, industrious, brave, wise, conscious, and patriotic; Isn't liberating such a great productive force paving the way for the industrialization of New China?

    土地改革为新中国的工业化开辟了道路
    北京大学教授  马大猷
    土地改革是要“废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，实行农民的土地所有制，借以解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，为新中国的工业化开辟道路”。这个伟大决定的正确性是我在这次到川南参加土地改革工作中所深刻体会到的。在工作中我看见了伟大的生产潜力，大大地增强了对工业化前途的信念。
    封建土地所有制严重地束缚着农村生产力，使农业生产无法发展，国家的工业化也不可能进行。××县集峰村农民邱银章的情况给我们一个有力的说明。邱银章佃了地主熊杨氏一片田，每年产量二十八石黄谷（每石三百二十四斤）。根据佃约（是按国民党官定格式写的，共有十二条），邱要预先交十石黄谷作为押金，准备地主处罚，每年要交租二十二石半，另交豆租二斗，稻草二百捆，义务作工十二个，义务为地主碾米并且替地主交纳一些租税，最后一条规定邱银章不得作其他生意，违背时要加处罚（年节送礼和其他“规例”还没有写到佃约上）。在这样严重剥削下，农民在丰年中也只有麦糊，杂粮糊口，荒年就只有逃荒讨饭了。农民对这种残酷剥削，只有忿怒的忍受，否则地主一来夺佃，立刻就连住的地方都没有了（川南农村中，房屋是跟着田的）。那年收成好一些，地主立刻就来加租加押，农民不但得不到好处，反而要遭殃，他们又怎能有兴致发展生产呢？在封建土地所有制下，再加上过去反动政府的压迫，很多农民要变为赤贫（在川南像这样的赤贫要占人口的百分之二十）甚至于家破人亡。集峰村的尹惠章是一个典型例子。尹惠章的父亲原来是个佃中农，在一九一九年还有一百五十两银子，作为押金，向地主黄家佃了六十石田，不到六年押金被罚得只剩了五两，尹家就被夺了佃，赶了出来。又拿着五两银子向另一地主佃了二石土（旱地），生活就更困难了。后来尹惠章的父亲只好把自己一个女孩抱出去作童养媳，把四弟兄养大后，让他们出去给地主作工。尹惠章十六岁起替地主看牛，每年赚一斗米。这样的贫苦生活过了十几年，因为弟兄们逐渐长大，劳动力多，又集攒了一些钱，希望能再佃些田来种。这正是日本帝国主义疯狂进攻我国的时候，国民党在前方节节退让，在后方却大抓壮丁，一九三六年十二月到一九三七年九月间接连地把四个弟兄的三个都拉去，至今没有消息。尹惠章怕再被拉，就拜萧和尚作老师出了家，老人不久也死了，这一家就这样完了。这就是劳动人民在反动封建统治下的归宿。事实上像尹惠章这样保全了性命的还是侥幸呢，许多农民都说：“如果再不解放，我们都要被地主惩死。”封建土地所有制使少数寄生阶级荒淫无耻的享乐，使占人口绝对多数的农民终年劳动，不得一饱，大大地妨碍了生产的发展，限制了国家的工业化。
    土地改革废除了不合理的封建剥削制度，使农民初次享受自己劳动的果实。占收成百分之七十以上的地租不再向地主缴纳了，农村购买力自然要大大地增加。在另方面，因为农民不再为地主服劳役，过去不事生产的地主也要被强迫参加劳动，农村的劳动力也大大地解放了。用川南情况作例，土地改革中每个农民平均可分二石田，如果一个主要劳动力平均负担一个五口（包括本人）之家，他一家可分到十石田。一个主要劳动力平均可以耕二十石田以上，所以至少有一半劳动力可以作其他工作。如果把全国农民因土地改革而解放的劳动力合计起来，数量是很惊人的。这部分农业人口逐渐转变为工业人口，其力量之大，当可想见了。事实上，如果把改良农具，改良耕作方法等所节省的人力算上，我们的工业生产后备军的实力还要雄厚得多。这个工业生产的潜在力量是我国工业化最宝贵的资本和最可靠的保证。
    我们的工业生产后备军的质量如何呢？是不是像帝国主义分子所宣传的，有些知识分子也盲从呼喊的，我们的农民是既贫又弱又愚？如果真是那样的话，人多也只是一种负担，对工业化不但不是动力，反而是很大的阻碍。和农民共同生活，共同工作后，我深刻地认识了帝国主义分子恶意诽谤的无稽，也认识了农民的伟大和智慧，建立了对工业化的绝对信心。
    经过长期残酷的封建剥削和压迫，农民的贫是不待言的。以川南为例，一般的田租都是“铁板租”（佃约载明“天干水旱，颗粒不得短少”），大约是丰年产量的七成左右，即使在丰年剩的粮食也不够吃，遇到旱涝，全部收入还不够交租。像这样，农民怎能不贫呢？很多农民住在猪圈牛棚旁边，生活的贫苦是城市中人想像不到的。集峰村的金福全大爷，今年已经七十二岁，家中几乎是一无所有，一条被子已烂成一条一条的连不到一起，在夏天为节省起见只穿一条短裤，皮肤已受惯了风吹雨打日晒虫咬，他最大的奢侈就是每月买菜油四两作点灯和吃用。在这种极端贫困情况下，农民是不是就悲观失望、不努力工作了呢？恰恰相反，农民的勤劳勇敢是任何困难都吓不倒的。土地的使用程度几乎到了极点，山上一直到山顶都开垦了梯田，田坎、田边也都种上了粮食，甚至在石头上都铺了几寸厚的土，种上了高粱和菜蔬。家庭中，人人都从事劳动，织布绩麻打草鞋直到挑盐巴，挖煤炭（开土窑），凡是可以做的事不管怎么艰苦，都有人做，老人儿童也没有一个空闲的。农民就是用这种大无畏的精神向自然搏斗，克服生活的困难。土地改革后，农民头上压着的两座大山都已推倒，更没有任何力量可以拦阻农民的充分发挥力量，为美好的未来而奋斗了。
    农民的智慧是无穷的。我在出发前也了解自己能力的薄弱，晓得要依靠群众的道理，但总觉得自己至少计算的本领还不错，所以就带着一支计算尺，满怀信心的踏上征途，准备有所表现。一到川南，看到的都是梯田，弯弯曲曲，奇形怪状，以前所学的长方形、三角形甚至于梯形、扇形的公式都不中用，计算尺的威力也无从施展。相反地，农民根据他们丰富的经验，不但可以根据一块田中可以下多少种，估计出面积来，并且再进一步，又根据土色，风向，水源等条件估计出产量来，估计的准确程度可做到只相差百分之一或二，这是学校里训练出来的任何专家都做不到的事。在分田时，全村一千多人，在一天中就公平合理地把大小，肥瘦，高低不等的几千块田分完了，毫无争执，人人满意。在其他工作中，如斗争地主，调查地主生产资料情况，以至于征收没收，分配果实等，农民都表现了无比的智慧。分配果实能完全按照贫苦程度和需要情况办理。在土地改革中，农民的智慧第一次得到充分发挥的机会，因而做出惊人的成绩。
    经过土地改革的锻炼，农民的觉悟程度也大大地提高了。在二百多户的集峰村中涌现了七十多个积极分子，不分昼夜、耽搁自己的活路，任劳任怨，义务地为群众服务。中农沈玉昆因为须要整天在村中工作，无法进行生产，就半夜里起来到田中耕作；贫农曾光才常常为了开会，帮助青年学习，领导儿童团活动等连续好几顿饭不能吃；六十多岁的贫农兰什发和青年一样地积极参加了所有活动，并且领导了查田评产工作；武装部长邱银章（贫农）因为保证村中治安，白天在村中工作，晚上还出去巡逻，并且常常不分昼夜地到几十里外出差，他在全部土地改革过程中只有一天没有到村上来，第二天他就来检讨说：“我犯了错误，昨天我去割自己的谷子去了。”——这都是高度觉悟的表现。查田评产工作，一共用了两天，在全村中查出了国民党时代隐瞒的黑田（水地）百分之二十五，黑土（旱地）百分之一百四十七，有一个小组竟查出黑田百分之五十二，黑土百分之二百八十九，这些收获主要的是小组中自报公议的结果（大规模的复查中，只查出了黑田千分之四），没有群众的高度觉悟，这是不可能的。在分田工作中，也充分地表现了团结互让的精神，不但本村的人互相未发生争执，其他田少的村庄派来二百多人参加分田也受到热烈的欢迎，并且得到特别照顾，这种高度阶级友爱的精神给我很大的启发。在对地主斗争中，群众的觉悟也有充分的表现，在面对面斗争中，农民用斗理斗法的方式表现了无比的威力，把地主完全斗垮，认罪认赔；在反分散运动中，经发动群众，一个村中追回来的地主分散财产就要值一百多石黄谷；这样伟大的力量使封建地主阶级完全低头降服了。
    在处理个人问题时，农民也表现了正确的认识。因逃避壮丁而做了和尚的尹惠章在土地改革期中因对宗教毫无信仰而还了俗并且结了婚。他在向贫农徐温卿（寡妇）求婚时说的话是很多知识分子说不出来的：“过去封建社会逼得我出了家，现在毛主席来了，我得了解放，可是‘十个指拇儿摁不住几个跳蚤’，一个人有多大本领，单独生活总是苦的。我知道你的脾气不好，但是有什么关系呢，我们可以常开检讨会，我错了，你检讨我，我下次就不那样了；你错了，我也可以检讨你。”徐温卿说：“有什么活路，我愿意抢着做，我就看不惯懒惰的人。”尹说：“我也是那样。”他们结婚后，感情很好，生产积极，这个新式家庭的前途是无限光明的。通过尹徐的婚事，当地一般农民都已建立了对新式婚姻和新式婚礼的认识，继续又有两对爱人圆满地解决了他们的婚姻问题，给婚姻法作了有力宣传。
    在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，农民的动人表现是写不完的。我这次受了“土改大学”的教育，个人收获远超过以往两年学习的所得。我们的贡献是微薄的，如果还有些贡献的话，主要的就是使中央人民政府与人民之间有了进一步的联系，农民深深地感觉到毛主席对他们的关心，大大地增加了“永远跟着共产党走”的决心，衷心地喊出：
    “翻身不忘共产党，享福要谢毛主席。”在土地改革过程中，通过抗美援朝工作和政治教育，农民对祖国的认识也大为提高，因而更加强了对祖国的热爱。农民现在不但抢着要参军，并且要参加人民志愿军。当一个农民青年因身体不合格而“考”不上兵时，他的失望是很难劝解的。在增产捐献中，农民对集体力量有深刻的认识，中农沈玉昆说：“我们每个人捐一千元，全村就是一百多万，全国的捐献就可以买很多飞机大炮去抗美援朝了。”因此运动开展得非常热烈。全村共认捐了六百万元，三天之内便已经交足三百万元以上。土地改革后的农民迫切地要求文化，很多青年要求参加青年团，并且希望将来参加共产党，他们对新中国的光辉灿烂远景是一心向往的。
    这就是我们的工业生产后备军；人数众多，勤劳，勇敢，智睿，觉悟，热爱祖国；解放了这样一个伟大的生产力量还不是为新中国的工业化开辟了道路么？
