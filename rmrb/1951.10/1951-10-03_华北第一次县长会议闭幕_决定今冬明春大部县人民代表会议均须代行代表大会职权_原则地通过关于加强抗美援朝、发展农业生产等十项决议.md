Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The First North China County Head Conference concluded successfully on the 30th of last month. The conference earnestly discussed the current situation in the North China region and the main demands of people from all walks of life, and fully exchanged work experiences of local people's governments. Resolutions were made on strengthening the work of the County People's Representative Conference and preferential treatment work, as well as on the overall work tasks of the County People's Government for this winter and next year.

The conference discussed and adopted Minister Liu Lantao's report from the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government on "Further Strengthening the Work of the County People's Representative Conference" and Minister Xie Juezai's report from the Ministry of Internal Affairs on "Earnestly Strengthening Preferential Treatment Work," and these were made as two special resolutions of the conference. At the same time, in order to strengthen the unified leadership of government work and promote the comprehensive development of work in a planned way, the conference also principally approved resolutions on ten work items: strengthening Resistance Against America and Aiding Korea; further developing agricultural production; actively organizing production for disaster relief; strengthening urban work; continuing to suppress counter-revolutionaries; strengthening cultural, educational, and health work, and running winter schools well; completing land reform in Suiyuan Province and consolidating the achievements of land reform throughout the region; earnestly implementing the Marriage Law; improving and training cadres; and further strengthening the construction of democratic power. These resolutions are intended to be submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval as the work plan for all counties and banners in the North China region this winter and next year.

Regarding the central topic of this conference—further strengthening the People's Representative Conference of all circles in the county (banner)—after repeated discussions in group meetings and plenary sessions, all participants reached a consensus in their thinking that the People's Representative Conference of all circles is a fundamental system of our country. It was believed that only by holding the People's Representative Conference of all circles well can people from all circles be better united to carry out work together, and further consolidate and develop the people's democratic dictatorship. The conference conducted criticism and self-criticism of some incorrect ideas in the past. The conference believes that the County People's Representative Conference should be effectively formed into a regular and consolidated system in the future; therefore, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the broad masses, fully promote democracy, and earnestly carry out the election of representatives. Each meeting must have a central topic; it is necessary to earnestly collect and be responsible for handling the proposals of the people's representatives; the People's Representative Conference must be convened in accordance with the prescribed time; and the organization and meeting system of the Standing Committee must be earnestly established and improved. The conference decided that this winter and spring, except for a few counties and banners in Suiyuan, the People's Representative Conference of all counties in the North China region must, in a planned and led manner, exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress on behalf of the People's Congress, and elect the county head, deputy county head, and members of the County People's Government. This is an extremely important step in the current democratic construction in North China, and also a great leap forward in the work of the People's Representative Conference. Only in this way can the broad masses be more effectively mobilized to overcome difficulties and complete various work tasks.

Regarding preferential treatment work, the conference believed that the regulations on preferential treatment promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government should be implemented, and the political and social status of family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and family members of staff members should be improved. Various preferential treatment measures should be earnestly implemented, regular inspections should be conducted, and a regular system should be formed.

During the conference, in addition to listening to Premier Zhou's report on the current political situation and work tasks, Vice Premier Dong Biwu and Secretary-General Li Weihan of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and Secretary Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made reports to the conference on political power construction, united front work, and the development of agricultural production in North China. During the conference, symposiums were also held on issues such as the construction of political power in minority areas, women's participation in politics, and the implementation of the Marriage Law.

At the closing of the conference, Minister Liu Lantao of the North China Affairs Department first elaborated on the resolutions of the conference, selecting the key points. He emphasized that under the guidance of unifying thought and unifying action, when implementing the work of strengthening the People's Representative Conference, it is necessary to pay attention to combining it with the current central work and adapting it to local conditions. After the conference adopted various resolutions, it also passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Premier Zhou, and Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Finally, Deputy Minister Tao Xijin of the North China Affairs Department delivered the closing speech. He said that this conference was convened under the direct leadership of the Central People's Government and had been fully prepared; therefore, the conference achieved great success. Deputy Minister Tao called on all participating comrades to effectively organize forces to implement the resolutions after returning to their respective regions, and to widely conduct propaganda and education among people from all walks of life.

The conference lasted twelve days. During the conference, all attendees met with Chairman Mao and the central leaders, and participated in the National Day celebrations. Everyone felt extremely excited. They unanimously expressed that they would earnestly implement the resolutions of the conference, further carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the people of North China, and strive for greater glory.

    会议讨论和通过了中央人民政府华北事务部刘澜涛部长关于“进一步加强县人民代表会议工作”的报告和内务部谢觉哉部长关于“认真加强优抚工作”的报告，并作为会议的两项专门决议。同时，为了加强政府工作的统一领导和有计划地推动全面工作的开展，会议并原则地通过了关于加强抗美援朝；进一步发展农业生产；积极组织生产救灾；加强城镇工作；继续镇压反革命；加强文教卫生工作，办好冬学；完成绥远省土地改革和巩固全区土地改革的成果；认真贯彻婚姻法；提高和培养干部；进一步加强民主政权建设十项工作决议，拟经政务院批准后作为华北全区各县、旗人民政府今冬明年的工作计划。

    会议历时十二日。会议期间全体出席人员会见了毛主席和中央各首长，参加了国庆节观礼，大家感到无比的兴奋；他们一致表示：要很好地执行会议决议，进一步发扬华北人民的革命传统，争取更大的光荣。
