    Learning the Spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Loyalty to the People's Cause
    — Reflections on "An Ordinary Battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteers"

    To the Editor:
    I was deeply moved after reading the article "An Ordinary Battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteers" published in the People's Daily on September 21st. The image of the heroic volunteers is deeply engraved in my mind.
    The heroic company commander of the Volunteers, Tao Jinshan, was wounded, and the instructor advised him to go down, but he said, "When a Communist Party member is required to shed his own blood, he should happily, cheerfully, and bravely offer it for the happiness of mankind!" What a noble communist quality worthy of respect! This has made me more clear about how a Communist Party member should be loyal to the cause of communism, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. When the Party needs him, what attitude should he take to accept and complete the glorious tasks given by the Party.
    And the selfless sacrifice of Platoon Leader Liu Yueyong is a complete manifestation of revolutionary heroism. They were fearless in the face of the enemy and found ways to overcome difficulties. In a battle to annihilate the enemy, they could not drink water or eat for two days and one night. Even the wounded endured hunger, thirst, and physical pain. They did not bow their heads to difficulties. They cleverly and flexibly snatched water from the enemy, saved the wounded, eliminated the enemy, and completed the task. This tenacious fighting spirit to overcome difficulties is worth learning from.

### 学习志愿军忠于人民事业的精神——“人民志愿军‘普通一营’”读后感

    学习志愿军忠于人民事业的精神
    ——“人民志愿军‘普通一营’”读后感编辑同志：
    我读了九月二十一日人民日报发表的“人民志愿军‘普通一营’”一文后，非常激动。志愿军英雄们的形象，深深地刻在我的脑海里。
    志愿军的英雄连长陶金山负了伤，指导员劝他下去，他说：“一个共产党员，当需要你流自己的鲜血的时候，自己就要高兴、愉快、勇敢地拿出来，为人类求幸福！”这是多么值得崇敬的共产主义的高贵品质！这就使我更加明确了一个共产党员应该如何忠于共产主义的事业，忠于党，忠于人民。当党需要自己的时候，应以什么样的态度去接受与完成党所给予的光荣任务。
    又如排长刘月勇的忘我牺牲的精神，完全是一种革命的英雄主义，他们临敌毫不畏惧，遇到困难设法克服，他们在一次歼灭敌人的战斗中，曾两天一夜喝不上水，吃不上饭。连伤员都同样忍受着饥渴和肉体的痛苦。他们没有向困难低头。他们机警灵活地从敌人那里抢来水，救活了伤员，消灭了敌人，完成了任务。这种顽强的克服困难的战斗精神，是值得我们学习的。
