To Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders, fighters, political workers, logistics staff, and transportation staff of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    On the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure from the country to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference extends to you our deep and warm greetings and gratitude, and congratulates you on your victory!

    In the past year, in the just war against American aggression, fought together with the Korean People's Army, your heroic struggle and sacrifices have resulted in brilliant victories, not only directly safeguarding the security of China and Korea, thwarting the ferocity of the aggressors headed by US imperialism, but also greatly inspiring the courage and confidence of the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of the world in striving for lasting peace and opposing wars of aggression.

    You, who are fighting heroically to defend the motherland and defend peace in the East, are the glory of the motherland and the glory of all peace-loving people in the world.

    Although the victory of the Korean-Chinese people's anti-aggression war has severely battered the US aggressors and forced the United States to accept armistice negotiations, the American aggressors have continuously delayed, deceived, and provoked during the negotiations to hinder their progress. At the same time, they have illegally and unilaterally concluded a peace treaty with Japan, arming Japanese fascist bandits in an attempt to further implement their plans to invade China and other Asian countries. This shows that the imperialists, headed by the United States, will not stop their arrogant acts of aggression unless they are taught a sufficient lesson. Therefore, the realization of peace requires us to make greater efforts.

    In the past year, the people of the whole country have been enthusiastically supporting your war at the front through a large-scale movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. In the future, we should launch a patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy, continue to expand the movement to donate weapons, and more widely and deeply carry out patriotic education throughout the country, formulate patriotic pledges, and mobilize all forces to provide support for you. We hope you will continue your efforts and strive for the final realization of peace in Korea.

    Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the fight to resist US aggression and aid Korea!

    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

                The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
                                     October 24, 1951

    人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议
    致中国人民志愿军贺电中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员暨全体指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员、运输工作人员同志们：
    值此中国人民志愿军抗美援朝保家卫国出国作战的纪念日，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议谨向你们致以深切、热烈的慰问和感谢，并为你们的胜利而祝贺！
    一年来，你们在和朝鲜人民军共同反对美国侵略的正义战争中，英勇奋斗、流血牺牲所取得的辉煌的胜利，不仅直接地保卫了中朝两国的安全，挫败了以美帝国主义为首的侵略者的凶焰，而且大大鼓舞了中国人民、朝鲜人民和世界人民争取持久和平、反对侵略战争的勇气和信心。
    为保卫祖国、保卫东方和平而英勇战斗的你们，乃是祖国的光荣，也是世界上一切爱好和平的人民的光荣。
    朝中人民反侵略战争的胜利，虽然已经使美国侵略者遭受严重的打击，并迫使美国接受停战谈判，但在谈判中美国侵略者还是不断地拖延、欺骗、挑衅以阻碍谈判的进行，并且同时还非法地片面订立对日和约，武装日本法西斯强盗，以图实现其更进一步地侵略中国和亚洲各国的计划。这就说明：以美国为首的帝国主义者，不得到足够的教训，决不肯停止他们的狂妄的侵略行为。因此，和平的实现，还要我们作更大的努力。
    全国人民在一年来，以规模壮阔的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，热烈地支援你们在前方的战争。今后更当展开爱国增产节约运动，继续努力扩大捐献武器的运动和在全国范围内更加普遍、深入地展开爱国主义教育，订立爱国公约，动员一切力量，为你们的后援。望你们再接再厉，为着争取最后实现朝鲜的和平而奋斗。
    在抗美援朝战斗中牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
                中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议
                                     一九五一年十月二十四日
