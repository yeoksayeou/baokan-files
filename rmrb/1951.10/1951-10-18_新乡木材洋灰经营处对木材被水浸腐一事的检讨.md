Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

The criticism from readers Wang Xinzhai and Zhixin in the "Readers' Letters" section of the People's Daily on September 19th regarding the soaking of timber in water at our office is very correct. We sincerely accept it. All cadres in our office, especially the leading cadres, have conducted thorough self-criticism ideologically and have reported the results of the self-criticism to the superior company, requesting due punishment.

Upon examination, the reasons for the rotting of timber due to water immersion at our office are primarily due to our lack of emphasis on the storage and management of timber in our thinking. Because timber is bulky and large, the problem of a storage yard at our office has never been resolved. Furthermore, due to the large turnover of timber allocations, we developed a perfunctory attitude towards timber storage and management. In June of this year, a large quantity of pit props was transported to Xinxiang. Our office had no place to store them, so the Xinxiang Branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company assisted us in finding a low-lying area to use as a temporary yard. Although we considered that the timber might be flooded by water at the time, we also thought that it was good enough to have a place to store it, and it would be sold sooner or later. This shows that we still had the simplistic view of completing the task by simply "selling it," without realizing that storage and management are also important parts of completing the task. This erroneous thinking and behavior has caused losses to state property. Secondly, it was caused by a lack of thorough planning and foresight in our work, resulting in a purely "economic viewpoint." In July, it rained heavily for several consecutive days, and the timber was completely flooded. Although our office immediately tried to drain and salvage the timber, we thought that it was okay after the water was drained, and we did not take measures to transfer the timber to higher ground (we estimated that it would cost over 10,000 jin of millet to transfer it). As a result, the timber was flooded a second time. The lesson of being penny-wise and pound-foolish is worth remembering.

Our improvement measures are as follows: 1. Immediately transfer the timber soaked in water; 2. Thoroughly correct all the above-mentioned incorrect work viewpoints and attitudes; 3. Organize cadres to thoroughly study the State Council's "Instructions on Saving Timber," to further recognize the seriousness of this incident ideologically, so as to improve our work; 4. Begin to rectify timber storage and management, improve the storage and management personnel's understanding of the work, and enable them to give full play to their enthusiasm for protecting state property.

### 新乡木材洋灰经营处对木材被水浸腐一事的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    新乡木材洋灰经营处对木材被水浸腐一事的检讨编辑同志：
    九月十九日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表读者王信斋、志新二同志对我处木材泡在水里的批评，是非常正确的。我们诚恳地接受。我处全体干部、特别是领导干部除在思想上进行深刻的检查外，并将检查结果报告上级公司，请求给予应得处分。
    检查我处发生木材被水浸腐的原因，首先是由于我们在思想上对木材的储放和保管工作未加重视。因木材体积笨重庞大，我处货厂问题一直没能解决，又因木材调拨，流动性大，我们就发生了对木材储管工作马虎从事的思想。本年六月，坑木大量运来新乡，我处无处存放，即由中国煤业建筑器材公司新乡分公司协助，找到洼地一块，作为暂时厂地。当时虽也考虑到木材会被水淹，但又认为能有地方存放就算了，早晚得卖完。这说明我们还存在着单纯以“卖完”为完成任务的观点，没有认识到储管工作也是完成任务的重要部分。这种错误的思想和行为使国家财产遭到损失。其次是由于工作上缺乏周密计划和远见，而造成的单纯“经济观点”所致。七月份大雨连下数日，木材全部被水淹，我处虽立即设法排水抢救，但水排完即认为没事了，再未设法将木材转移高地（我们计算转移一下得一万余斤小米的费用），结果使木材遭到二次水泡。这种小手小脚，因小失大的教训是值得我们记取的。
    我们的改进办法如下：1、立即转移被水浸沤的木材；2、彻底纠正上述一切不正确的工作观点和态度；3、组织干部深入学习政务院“关于节约木材的指示”，从思想上进一步认识发生这个事件的严重性，从而改进工作；4、开始整顿木材储管工作，提高储管人员对工作的认识，使之发挥高度的爱护国家财产的积极性。
