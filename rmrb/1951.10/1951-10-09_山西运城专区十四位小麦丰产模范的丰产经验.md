Shanxi's Yuncheng Prefecture, in this year's patriotic bumper harvest movement, saw the emergence of fourteen wheat bumper harvest models. These fourteen bumper harvest models planted a total of 283.2 mu of wheat, producing 62,592 jin of wheat, averaging 220 jin per mu, 75% higher than the average wheat yield in the prefecture. The particularly high-yielding irrigated land averaged 503 jin of wheat per mu, three times higher than the local average wheat yield. The particularly high-yielding dry land averaged 346 jin per mu, almost twice the local average wheat yield. For example, Jin Kedian, a wheat bumper harvest model in Yuxiang, achieved a yield of 518 jin per mu on his dry land wheat; Fan Jun, a wheat bumper harvest model in Xia County, achieved a yield of 608 jin per mu on his irrigated wheat, setting a new record for wheat bumper harvests in the area. In order to summarize and promote wheat bumper harvest experiences, the Yuncheng Prefecture invited these fourteen wheat bumper harvest models to a forum on August 21st, summarizing the following key experiences:

	1. "Farming has a hundred clever tricks, but manure is a priceless treasure." This is the first experience summarized by the bumper harvest models. The high-yielding land of Jin Kedian in Yuxiang and Shao Shuanghe in Xie County all received 6 to 7 cartloads of base fertilizer per mu. They not only applied a large amount of fertilizer but, more importantly, paid attention to fertilization techniques, such as improving fertilizer effectiveness and maintaining fertilizer efficiency.

	2. "Thick soil and ample moisture are the cleverest of clever tricks." To achieve thick soil and water retention, it is necessary to cultivate and plow deeply. All the bumper harvest models attached great importance to the "three cultivations during the three 'fu' periods" method (i.e., plowing once during the "sanfu" period after wheat harvest, plowing again after a month or so, and then plowing again before autumn harvest and wheat planting). There are many benefits to diligent cultivation: (1) The turned-up raw soil can be transformed into mature soil after being exposed to the sun; (2) The soil can be mixed and kneaded thoroughly; (3) Rainwater can easily penetrate, preserving moisture and resisting drought; (4) Wheat stubble and weeds are turned into the ground, making it easy to rot and topdress. Because plowing has so many benefits, the wheat fields of these bumper harvest models were generally plowed four times, and Fan Jun's wheat fields were plowed five times.

	3. "What kind of seed, what kind of seedling; what kind of gourd, what kind of ladle." This experience illustrates the importance of seed selection, seed preservation, and seed soaking and mixing. In order to strengthen the disease resistance of wheat, Shao Shuanghe of Xie County specifically selected seeds from wheat fields that had developed jaundice disease but where the selected seeds showed no signs of the disease; Fan Jun of Xia County implemented ear selection; Zhang Ruyuan of Xinjiang carried out seed weeding and culling to maintain the purity of superior seeds. Some bumper harvest models mixed seeds with oil in the "fu" days and exposed them to the sun; when sowing, they mixed them with medicine again. In this way, the wheat seedlings were strong and there were fewer diseases. As Jin Kedian said: "Seeds cannot be sown carelessly; everything must be planned."

	4. "Listen to the words of the government." This is a consistent and important personal experience of the fourteen bumper harvest models. Responding to the government's call, they implemented organization, creating important conditions for improving farming techniques and increasing yields. Therefore, they said: "Where mutual aid is well done, more grain is harvested." Because the Shao Shuanghe mutual aid group was organized, plowing, harrowing, and cultivation were done twice as much as individual households, and more fertilizer could be accumulated. His highest yield per mu of irrigated land was 1.5 dan more than that of individual farmers, and dry land yielded 1 dan more. Xue Ligang of Ruicheng used to plant 27 mu of wheat but could never finish plowing it. This year, he joined the mutual aid group and plowed it all. In addition, the role of water conservancy construction in grain bumper harvests is also very significant. The yield of an ordinary mu of dry land is half the yield of a mu of irrigated land. Therefore, in areas with water conservancy conditions, opening more canals and digging more wells is also a good way to increase production.

At present, it is the wheat planting season. All localities should immediately check the preparation work for wheat planting, and promptly summarize bumper harvest experiences and promote bumper harvest experiences, to further advance wheat planting work and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

    山西运城专区十四位小麦丰产模范的丰产经验
    山西运城专区在今年的爱国主义丰产运动中，出现了十四位小麦丰产模范。这十四位丰产模范共种小麦二百八十三亩二分，共产麦六万二千五百九十二斤，每亩平均产麦二百二十斤，比该专区一般小麦平均产量高百分之七十五。特别丰产的水地，每亩平均产麦五百零三斤，比当地一般麦地产量提高三倍。特别丰产的旱地，每亩平均产三百四十六斤，比当地一般麦地产量提高将近两倍。如虞乡小麦丰产模范晋克典的旱地麦，每亩产量达五百一十八斤；夏县小麦丰产模范樊浚的水地麦，每亩产量达六百零八斤，创造了该区小麦丰产新纪录。为了总结并推广小麦丰产经验，运城专区曾于八月二十一日邀请这十四位小麦丰产模范座谈，总结了以下几点经验：
    一、“庄稼百样巧、粪是无价宝”。这是丰产模范们的第一个经验总结。虞乡晋克典、解县邵双合的丰产地，每亩施底肥均达六至七车。他们不仅施肥量多，更重要的是注意了施肥技术，如提高肥力，保持肥效等。
    二、“土厚墒饱，巧里寻巧”。要作到土厚保水，必须多耕、深耕。各位丰产模范都很重视三伏三耕（即在收麦后的三伏天耕一次，隔一月余又耕一次，秋收种麦前再耕一次）的办法。勤耕的好处很多：（一）可使翻起来的生土经过太阳曝晒，可变成熟土；（二）土壤可以搅匀搓细；（三）雨水容易渗透，可以保墒抗旱；（四）麦茬和杂草翻在地下，容易沤烂顶粪。由于翻犁有这样多的好处，所以这些丰产模范的麦地一般都犁了四次，樊浚的麦地犁了五次。
    三、“什么种子什么苗，什么葫芦什么瓢”。这条经验说明了选种、保种与浸种拌种的重要性。解县邵双合为了加强小麦抗病力，去年特在发生了黄疸病的麦地里选了没病的种籽；夏县樊浚实行了穗选；新绛张如源为了保持优种纯度，进行了种籽去杂淘劣。有些丰产模范在伏天用油拌种，让阳光蒸晒；下种时再用药拌；这样种下去，麦苗又旺，病又少。正如晋克典说：“种籽不能马虎下，什么都得有计划。”
    四、“听政府的话”。这是十四位丰产模范一致的重要的切身体验。他们响应政府的号召，实行了组织起来，创造了提高耕作技术，提高产量的重要条件。因此，他们说：“那里互助搞的好，那里粮食打的多。”邵双合互助组由于组织起来，犁、耙、耕作都比单干户多作两遍，也能多积肥料，他每亩水地的最高产量，比单干农民多收一石五斗，旱地多收一石。芮城薛立刚种二十七亩麦，过去老是翻不完，今年参加了互助组，全翻过了。此外，兴修水利对粮食丰产的作用也很大，普通一亩旱地和一亩水地的产量相比，要低一倍。因此，在有水利条件的地区，多开渠、多打井，也是增产的好办法。
    目前正是种麦时期，各地应立即检查种麦准备工作，并及时总结丰产经验，推广丰产经验，把种麦工作推进一步，为争取明年小麦丰产而努力。
