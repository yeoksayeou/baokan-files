    The reports published in today's issue about Xi'an holding training classes for activists promoting patriotic pacts and Nanchong City, northern Sichuan, popularizing Chen Yushan's family patriotic pact, both illustrate the important role of strengthening leadership for activists in carrying out the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. Like Xi'an and Nanchong, they have valued the leadership and education of activists, utilizing spare time and slack farming seasons to run short-term training classes or give regular reports, with the aim of clearly explaining the significance and purpose of current work to the activists and helping them solve specific difficulties in their work. In addition, some places hold small-scale symposiums and typical reporting conferences to exchange work experience, which is of great help to the activists. Conversely, some places have neglected the leadership and education of the masses' activists, and even do not understand how to carry out work through the masses' activists, thus it is very easy for coercion and paternalistic practices to occur. One of the important reasons for the emergence of coercion in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea in many places lies in this.
    In fact, whether or not we can value relying on activists to carry out work, giving activists necessary training and concrete help, is a sign of whether the leading organs can follow the mass line in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and has a decisive relationship to whether or not patriotic education in resisting America and aiding Korea can be deepened. Strengthening the leadership and education of activists has not only become an important step in continuing to develop and deepen the resistance against America and aid Korea, but also plays an important role in overcoming commandism and formalism in the current patriotic movement. As everyone knows, those who meet directly with the broad masses every day and maintain close contact, live with the masses and can promptly know the masses' wishes and requirements, convey the calls of the government, the Party, and people's organizations, and actively organize the people to realize these calls are these activists. It is unimaginable that the work of resisting America and aiding Korea could be strengthened without the efforts of a large number of highly conscious and capable activists who correctly understand the significance and purpose of our work. Strengthening the leadership and education of activists is also an urgent demand of the broad masses of activists, and the leading organs must promptly meet their reasonable demands.

### 加强对积极分子的领导和教育

    加强对积极分子的领导和教育
    今天本刊发表的西安举办推行爱国公约积极分子训练班和川北南充市推广陈玉山家庭爱国公约的报道，都说明在进行抗美援朝工作中，加强对积极分子的领导有着重要的作用。像西安和南充那样，他们重视了对于积极分子的领导和教育，利用业余的和农忙的空隙时间，开办短期的训练班或作定期的报告，目的是把当前工作的意义和目的向积极分子交代清楚，并帮助他们具体解决工作中的困难。此外，有些地方举行小型座谈会和典型报告大会，交流工作经验，对于积极分子也有很大的帮助。与此相反，有些地方忽视了对群众积极分子的领导和教育，甚至根本不懂得通过群众积极分子进行工作，因而就极容易发生强迫命令和包办代替的现象。许多地方的抗美援朝工作中产生强迫命令现象的重要原因之一即在此。
    实际上，能不能重视依靠积极分子进行工作，给积极分子以必要的训练和具体的帮助，是领导机关在抗美援朝工作中能不能走群众路线的一个标志，对于能不能深入抗美援朝的爱国主义教育则有着决定的关系。加强对于积极分子的领导和教育，不但已经成为当前继续发展和深入抗美援朝的重要步骤，而且对于克服目前爱国运动中的命令主义和形式主义有着重要的作用。大家知道，天天和广大群众直接见面并保持着密切联系的，和群众生活在一起并能够及时知道群众的愿望和要求的，传达政府、党和人民团体的号召和积极组织人民群众实现这些号召的，就是这些积极分子。不能想像，没有大批有高度觉悟的，能够正确地了解我们工作的意义和目的的广大积极分子的努力，抗美援朝工作就能够加强起来。加强对于积极分子的领导和教育，同时也是广大积极分子的迫切要求，领导机关必须及时满足他们合理的要求。
