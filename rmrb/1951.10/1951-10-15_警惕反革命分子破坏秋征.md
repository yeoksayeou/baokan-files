    Be Vigilant Against Counter-Revolutionary Elements Sabotaging the Autumn Grain Collection
    According to the Hubei Daily, counter-revolutionary elements have been discovered sabotaging the autumn grain collection in some areas of Hubei. Counter-revolutionary elements use many methods to sabotage the autumn grain collection, the most common being to spread rumors and slander, provoke the masses and the People's Government, and even burn the grain harvested by the masses and assassinate district and township cadres involved in the autumn grain collection.
    The reason why counter-revolutionary elements dare and are able to carry out illegal activities, from the perspective of cadres, is due to two reasons: one is the cadres' relaxation and麻痹, and the other is that they have committed commandism and become detached from the masses in their work. Some county and district cadres, seeing that the land reform has been completed, "breathed a sigh of relief" and did not pay attention to continuing the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements in mass movements such as the autumn grain collection; some district and township cadres adopted the wrong method of coercion and command in order to quickly complete the autumn plowing tasks, arousing dissatisfaction among the masses; this created a gap for counter-revolutionary elements to sabotage the autumn grain collection.
    Cadres in any region, especially those in regions where land reform has just been completed or has not yet been carried out, must pay close attention to guarding against sabotage activities by counter-revolutionary elements during the autumn grain collection. It should be recognized that the remaining counter-revolutionary elements are painstakingly trying to sabotage us, and a slight carelessness will cause losses to our work. We should sufficiently estimate the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, conduct in-depth patriotic education for the masses, and publicize to the masses that the People's Government is carrying out the autumn grain collection to serve the people, and that it is "taken from the people and used for the people," so that the masses consciously and voluntarily bear the obligations they should fulfill to the country. This is the basic principle for carrying out the autumn grain collection and also an effective method to prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements.

    警惕反革命分子破坏秋征
    据湖北日报载：湖北若干地区，已发现反革命分子破坏秋征工作。反革命分子破坏秋征的方法很多，最大量的是造谣诬蔑，挑拨群众与人民政府的关系，甚至焚烧群众收获的谷物，暗杀进行秋征工作的区、乡干部。
    反革命分子所以敢于与能够进行非法活动，从干部方面检查，有两个原因，一是干部松懈麻痹，一是在工作中犯了命令主义，脱离群众。有些县、区干部，看到土地改革业已完成，就“松了一口气”，不注意在类似秋征这样的群众运动中，继续与反革命分子作斗争；有些区、乡干部为了迅速完成秋耕任务，采取了错误的强迫命令的方法，引起群众不满；这就造成了反革命分子破坏秋征的空隙。
    任何地区的干部，特别是土地改革刚刚完成和还没有进行土地改革地区的干部，在进行秋征工作中，必须十分注意警惕反革命分子的破坏活动。应该认识，残余的反革命分子正在处心积虑地破坏我们，稍一不慎，就会造成工作的损失。我们应该足够地估计群众的爱国热情，向群众进行深入的爱国主义教育，向群众宣传人民政府进行秋征，是为了给人民办事，是“取之于民，用之于民”的道理，使群众自觉自愿地担负对国家应尽的义务。这是进行秋征工作的基本原则，也是防止反革命分子破坏的有效方法。
