    Guan Ting District Government, Feixi County, Northern Anhui
    Should Conduct a Self-Criticism for Failing to Address Illegal Logging Promptly

    After personnel from the Zipeng Mountain Forest Farm in Feixi County, Northern Anhui, learned that people in Jie Xin Village, Juxing Township, Guanting District, Feixi County, were engaged in illegal logging, they immediately sent a letter to the Guanting District Government on September 30, urging them to stop it quickly. On October 3, they sent Deng Yanzuo, the leader of the farm's promotion team, to Guanting District to handle the situation with the district government based on the specific circumstances. Deng Yanzuo discovered that in Jie Xin Village alone, more than 160 pine trees and other trees with a diameter at breast height of more than seven inches had been felled in just over ten days. Based on the national forest protection policy, Deng Yanzuo sent a letter to Juxing Township and the village on the afternoon of October 3, requesting that Zhai Renchun and Liu Huagui, the leaders of the logging, be sent to the Guanting District Government for handling. On the morning of the 4th, when Deng Yanzuo rushed to the Guanting District Government, he happened to encounter the district government holding a meeting of township cadres. After talking with District Chief Heng, Heng said, "According to my understanding, these two are not the main culprits. There is another person with the surname Jie who is spreading rumors and taking the lead. Zhai and Liu have already returned last night." When Deng asked him to deal with the person with the surname Jie, Heng said, "Our meeting is important. We will investigate slowly after the meeting is over." Seeing that the district government was unlikely to handle the matter, Deng then requested District Chief Heng to transfer a cadre to the Juxing Township government to hold a mass meeting to effectively stop the illegal logging and investigate the extent of the damage. However, District Chief Heng said impatiently, "The meeting will take two days to finish, we have no time now, it won't work! If you can't wait, we will be responsible for this matter." Because Deng Yanzuo did not receive assistance from the Guanting District Government, he was unable to clearly investigate the actual situation of the forest damage, nor was he able to immediately stop the masses from illegal logging.

    I believe that the Guanting District Government's emphasis on being busy with meetings and its delaying and perfunctory attitude towards the illegal logging incident shows that they do not pay enough attention to the "Instructions on Saving Timber" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government, and they should conduct a profound self-criticism. The Guanting District Government should actively assist the Zipeng Mountain Forest Farm in conducting an in-depth investigation, appropriately handle those who damage the forest, and stop the masses from continuing to illegally log.

    皖北肥西县官亭区政府
    对滥伐木材事件不积极处理，应作检讨编辑同志：
    皖北肥西县紫蓬山林场人员，知道肥西官亭区聚星乡解新庄一带群众有滥伐森林的行为后，即于九月三十日函知官亭区政府速加制止，并于十月三日派该场推广组长邓延祚去官亭区，与区政府根据具体情况处理。邓延祚发现仅解新庄一个村子，在十数天内伐倒的胸高直径七寸以上的松树等树木，就有一百六十棵以上。邓延祚根据国家护林政策，于十月三日午后即函请聚星乡及该村将带头伐林者翟仁春、刘华贵二人送到官亭区政府，请区政府处理。四日晨，邓延祚赶赴官亭区政府时，恰逢区政府召开乡干部会议，经与衡区长谈话，衡说：“据我了解，为头的不是这两人，另有一个姓解的在内造谣作主，翟、刘二人昨晚已经回去了。”邓请他将那个姓解的加以处理时，衡说：“我们会议重要，等会开完了我们再慢慢调查。”邓看区政府处理无望，乃转请衡区长抽调一个干部到聚星乡政府召开群众会议，以对滥伐林木的行为作有效的制止，并调查破坏情况，但衡区长不耐烦地说：“会议两天才能开完，我们现在无空，不行！你们等不及，这事由我们负责好了。”邓延祚因得不到官亭区政府的协助，未能将破坏林木的确实情况调查清楚，也未能即时制止群众滥伐林木。
    我认为，官亭区政府强调忙于开会，对滥伐林木的事件采取拖延应付的态度，这说明他们对中央人民政府政务院公布的“关于节约木材的指示”重视是不够的，应该作深刻检讨。官亭区政府应积极主动协助紫蓬山林场深入调查，对破坏林木者加以适当处理，并制止群众继续滥伐林木。
