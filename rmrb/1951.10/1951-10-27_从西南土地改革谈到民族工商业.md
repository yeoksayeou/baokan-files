    From Land Reform in Southwest China to National Industry and Commerce
    Zhang Naiqi
    One. This time I went to Southwest China to participate in land reform work, assigned to the Fourth District of Hechuan County, Sichuan East, for a period of sixty-five days. Now, I will talk about my experience regarding the relationship between land reform and national industrialists and merchants.
    More than 90 percent of the industrialists and merchants in the interior have ties to land. Before land reform, rent reduction and deposit refunds had been carried out in the Southwest region. Many industrialists and merchants had to take out some funds to refund rent and deposits, which greatly dampened their enthusiasm and affected their working capital. At the beginning of land reform, industrialists and merchants in townships were afraid that they would also be overthrown. They wondered: Landlords and industrialists and merchants are both exploiting classes, so why strike down the landlords while protecting national industry and commerce?
    In fact, although landlords and industrialists and merchants both engage in exploitation, the nature of their exploitation is different. The exploitation by the landlord class is barbaric, extra-economic, and hinders the development of social productive forces. Why? This is inseparable from its senility, stubbornness, and backwardness.
    "It is a thief to be old and not to die." Confucius's saying is not entirely correct for people, but it applies without exception to the historically senile and declining exploiting classes. When a class becomes a privileged class, able to gain without labor, enjoy themselves to the fullest, and unscrupulously exploit and oppress others, it will inevitably become very conservative, stubborn, selfish, and cruel. The landlord class is like this. As a landlord, one generally only knows how to collect rent and enjoy life; only knows how to increase exploitation of peasants in order to increase one's own enjoyment. They not only never pay attention to management improvements, the improvement of agricultural tools and soil, and the construction of water conservancy, but often never even ask about it. Because landlords generally only know how to harm others for their own benefit, single-mindedly scheming to take advantage of others, without any thought of forward development, their cruel nature is inevitable. Novels and dramas depict such people as very sinister and vicious, and that is the truth. Therefore, not only should land reform be carried out from the perspective of developing social productive forces, but also from a moral point of view, these people should be overthrown.
    Two.
    Land ownership in eastern Sichuan is very concentrated. In one village in the Fourth District of Hechuan County, 8 percent of the landlords owned 78.6 percent of the village's land. In rural areas near Chongqing, the landlord class owned more than 95 percent of the land. Landlords not only monopolized large amounts of land, but also monopolized large numbers of houses. In eastern Sichuan, a house for tenants to live in is often built on a piece of land. At first glance, it seems that the landlord is very considerate in arranging housing for the peasants, but in reality, it is a most cruel method of exploitation. By adopting this method, peasants can only settle down if they rent land, and lose their homes if they lose their tenancy. Therefore, it is difficult for peasants to resist landlords; at the same time, landlords can clearly see the economic situation of the peasants. If peasants cultivate carefully, use more fertilizer, and cultivate the land well, increasing the harvest, the landlord will increase the rent. If peasants engage in sideline production, raise fat pigs, or earn some extra income from odd jobs, the landlord will immediately increase the deposit. If the peasants do not comply, he will threaten to take back the tenancy; always trying to drain the peasants' lifeblood until they become "dry people." In Sichuan, poor peasants are generally called "dry people."
    There is a folk song in Sichuan that says: "Three knives over the heads of dry people, heavy rent, high interest, high deposit." Sichuan's rent is indeed heavier than in other provinces: the rent generally reaches 80 percent of the land's normal yield; some even reach 100 percent – this is called "full rent." The terms of tenancy are also very tyrannical: there is the so-called "iron plate rent," which stipulates in the lease: "Regardless of natural disasters, water or drought, no reduction in volume is allowed; if there is a shortfall, the deposit will be deducted." The methods of exploitation are even more pervasive: there is the so-called "bean rent," which means that rent is also collected for planting beans on the ridges of the fields; there is also "straw rent," which means that even rice straw must be handed over to the landlord. "Crows are all black under the sky," and the landlords of Southwest China are probably the blackest of the bunch.
    The rent is too high, and knowing that the peasants cannot pay it, a very high deposit must be collected when renting out the land, so that the peasants cannot possibly owe anything. Where do the peasants get this deposit? Then they often have to borrow high-interest loans to "quench their thirst with poison." Of course, high-interest loans are often borrowed from the landlord class. In the event of a disaster, the landlord has the protection of the "iron plate rent" clause and can suffer no loss; the peasants will then lose their deposit, which means bearing the entire loss of the natural disaster.
    There is no limit to increasing rent and deposits. During the seven or eight years before liberation, due to the further concentration of land ownership, the landlords could do whatever they wanted. It was very common to increase rent and deposits once a year; some even increased it twice a year. The reactionary regime increased taxes and the apportionments of local baojia, which were naturally passed on to the peasants by increasing rent and deposits; even the costs of weddings and funerals in the landlord's family had to be compensated by increasing rent and deposits. What was particularly cruel was that the reactionary regime issued several fake currencies, and the currency value was high when the peasants paid the deposit, and the currency value was low when settling or refunding the deposit, and the loss of currency devaluation was often passed on to the peasants.
    The economic system of exploitation must be maintained by political rule. The ruling organization of the landlord class in eastern Sichuan was very thorough, and the ruling methods were very vicious. In addition to colluding with reactionary party groups and contracting baojia, they also became one with bandits, secret agents, Taoist sects, and gangs. Dark rule enveloped the countryside: if the peasants resisted slightly, they were either openly detained or subjected to private torture, and even executed arbitrarily. The reactionary regime's atrocities such as conscription gave the landlord class an even crueler weapon to oppress the peasants. The disaster of wives and children being separated and families being destroyed became the common experience of the peasants!
    It is very clear: not only was the peasants' enthusiasm for production low, but as a result of not having enough to eat and wear, even the physical strength to engage in labor production was weakened. In the midst of displacement and fleeing, a large amount of labor was also consumed. Therefore, although there are many people who want to farm the land, agricultural productivity must still decline, and the land gradually becomes barren from fertile. Due to the decline in peasants' purchasing power and the reduction in agricultural production, and even more due to the dumping of imperialist goods, national industry and commerce could not develop. Facing the reactionary regime's brutal policy of destroying national capital, and tempted by the stable profits and high returns of land investment, national industrialists and merchants generally had two minds and lacked the enthusiasm for management. Therefore, funds flowed to the land one after another, and the population continued to be congested in agriculture, forming a vicious cycle of more concentrated land ownership, a more relative surplus of the agricultural population, and a greater inability of industry and commerce to develop. This was the miserable situation in eastern Sichuan before liberation, swirling in the mire of despair and degeneration. As Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in his "Report on the Land Reform Question":
    "This is the root of our nation's being invaded, oppressed, impoverished, and backward, and the basic obstacle to our country's democratization, industrialization, independence, unification, and prosperity." We have fully proved this in the land reform work.
    Peasants often said in conversations: "If the Communist Party doesn't come again, we really won't be able to survive!" They regard the Chinese Communist Party as their savior and Chairman Mao as their great savior, and it truly flows from the bottom of their hearts. Chinese peasants have a revolutionary tradition, and such an extremely dark situation is unlikely to continue. It is possible that a revolution led by the working class could be a Zhang Xianzhong-style riot. It was completely correct for Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party to lead the Chinese people on the former path, and it is very beneficial to the country and the people.
    Three.
    We already know that the reactionary ruling classes in history are always unwilling to accept their own demise; their final struggles before death are frantic. But we only came to understand the true situation within more deeply after participating in land reform. The landlord class, which serves as the basis of reactionary rule throughout the ages, has long been accustomed to gaining without labor, living in luxury, ordering people around, and acting tyrannically. It is indeed a difficult task for them to abandon their privileges, put down their imposing airs, bow their heads and confess their crimes to the peasant masses who were once considered their "domestic slaves," and transform themselves through labor. The Qing Dynasty's policy of "giving to friendly nations rather than domestic slaves" was created by this kind of thinking; and now, a small handful of Chiang Kai-shek bandits are still colluding with imperialism and fantasizing about making a comeback, which is also a product of this kind of thinking. The stubborn resistance of the landlord class, although different in form, is essentially the same.
    After the liberation of Southwest China, the landlord class initially united with Kuomintang remnants and bandits to openly launch armed rebellions and resist grain requisition. The number of armed bandits reached about one million at its peak in March and April 1950. Their political representatives were stationed in Chongqing and Chengdu in a grand manner, and openly issued written warnings similar to ultimatums to the local authorities, demanding that they adopt a "policy of compromise" towards them. Due to the correct leadership of the Southwest authorities, the heroism of the People's Liberation Army soldiers and the efforts of the broad masses of the people, after a full-scale suppression of bandits movement was launched in the Southwest region, the main bandit forces were destroyed in less than half a year. In August and September of the same year, the movement to clear out bandits, oppose local bullies, reduce rent, and refund deposits began, and bandits were basically eliminated throughout the region. The resistance of the landlord class then turned to a latent stage; rumors, assassinations, poisoning, sabotaging production and construction, manipulating peasant associations behind the scenes, and other methods were widely carried out. Until the period of land reform, such conspiracies were still discovered from time to time. Their stubborn resistance and sophistry in paying illegal compensation were even more varied and full of ugly态. Their final struggles were indeed frantic.
    As a reactionary ruling class and its members, the more cruel the exploitation and the greater the crimes, the more frantic the final struggle. The only possible response of the revolutionary people to them is an even more severe blow, until the enemy surrenders unconditionally and then ceases. The reason why land reform must be a fierce struggle is that the landlord class's long-term barbaric exploitation and oppression is one reason, and the frantic nature of the final struggle is another reason.
    Four.
    The current stage of the Chinese revolution must eliminate the feudal landlord class on the one hand, and protect industry and commerce on the other. As a class, the interests of national industrialists and merchants are contrary to those of the feudal landlord class. The reason why Chinese national industrialists and merchants can join the revolutionary ranks is because they are still in the youth of capitalism; they have not only not grown into a reactionary ruling class that hinders the development of productive forces, but have also suffered from the oppression and devastation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Under the conditions of the New Democracy, China's capitalist components can develop in a direction that is beneficial to the country and the people through regulation and leadership; this is different from the barbaric feudal exploitation that hinders the development of productive forces. Therefore, Chinese national industrialists and merchants have the conditions to develop patriotism and the resulting service to the people. Chinese national industrialists and merchants have such historical conditions that they can develop under the principle of "both public and private interests are taken into consideration, and both labor and capital benefit."
    It must be especially pointed out here that in order for the development of Chinese national industry and commerce to conform to the principle of "both public and private interests are taken into consideration, and both labor and capital benefit," the leadership of the working class is indispensable. It is very clear that before liberation, Chinese national industrialists and merchants had no future. That was because they lacked the leadership of the working class. The development of free competition among the bourgeoisie in capitalist countries gives us sufficient lessons. In those countries, capitalists have progressed from unlimited exploitation of labor, plundering the people of the colonies, unscrupulously hindering progress, and harming the interests of the country and the people, to creating wars and carrying out crazy massacres in order to expand the market! Their crimes have exceeded those of the landlord class, and it is no longer a theoretical deduction that they will be completely eliminated soon, but there is a series of historical facts proved by the Russian Revolution as the head. Chinese national industrialists and merchants are very fortunate to have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and they have embarked on the bright road of New Democracy.
    Five.
    To promote the spirit of patriotism, national industrialists and merchants must better serve the people, mainly the workers and peasants. At present, peasants account for more than 80 percent of the total population; the working population is second only to the peasants, and their proportion of the total population is growing rapidly. The purchasing power of the workers and peasants is constantly increasing. They are the foundation of the new country, and serving them is not only an inexhaustible cause, but also an extremely glorious and great task.
    In the sense of valuing labor and respecting working people, our national industrialists and merchants must both serve the workers and peasants and learn from them. We must learn their virtue of loyalty and honesty, learn their spirit of diligence, hard work, and hard production, and learn their distinct enemies and friends and the will to fight resolutely. For workers, we must also learn their valuable qualities of foresight, selflessness, upholding truth, upholding progress, and carrying through to the end. Only in this way can we industrialists and merchants get rid of the original ambivalence and weakness towards the revolutionary cause, and fight to the end for the construction of the new China. With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, this is entirely possible.
    It must be admitted that we people who grew up in the old society are inevitably stained with many ideological consciousness of the old society. These are the ideological consciousness of imperialism and feudalism. We can retain and utilize the enemy's houses, furniture, equipment, machines, airplanes, artillery, and even production technology; but the enemy's ideological consciousness must never be retained and utilized. However, once an ideology is contaminated, it is the most difficult thing to get rid of. In particular, the ideological consciousness of feudalism, the depth of its foundation is by no means less than the economic system of feudalism. This ideological consciousness of the enemy has caused us great harm in the past, causing us to make many mistakes, and it must be thoroughly eradicated in the future.
    The ideological consciousness that imperialism instilled in us is mainly liberalism. Once liberalism came to China, it took root in the scattered and divided ideology of feudalism, and turned into the comprador ideology of being separated from the motherland, and the selfish individualism and sectarianism of not caring about national affairs and not being responsible to the people. Liberalism also took root in the extra-economic exploitation consciousness of feudalism and became the predatory ideology of colonial-style primitive accumulation. The monopolistic ideology that developed from liberalism even took root in the guild consciousness of feudalism and became colonial-style monopoly capitalism. The combination of these ideological consciousnesses developed economically into bureaucratic capitalism. Bureaucratic capitalism has been defeated by us, but the ideological consciousness of bureaucratic capitalism has not yet been eradicated.
    The ideological consciousness that feudalism left us is mainly conservative ideas, the idea of ​​profiteering, and guild consciousness. These ideological consciousnesses sometimes appear in old and backward ways, and sometimes appear in the relatively new ways instilled in us by imperialism.
    The ideological consciousness of imperialism and feudalism is the ideological consciousness of the enemy; however, the ideological consciousness of feudalism is more fundamental. Because commerce grew out of the feudal era. It has a long history in China; therefore, the ideological consciousness of feudalism remains much more in the old industry and commerce than in modern industry and commerce. Conversely, the ideological consciousness of imperialism remains slightly more in modern industry and commerce than in old industry and commerce. This is the reason why national industry and commerce must undergo reorganization and industrial and commercial enterprises must undergo democratic reform, and it is also the reason why our national industrialists and merchants must carry out self-ideological transformation.
    Six.
    The leading comrades of Southwest National Industry and Commerce called on everyone to cut off the tail of feudalism in the land reform movement, which is completely correct. Most of the national industrialists and merchants in Southwest China did this; they bravely cut off the relationship with the land, and many also cut off contact with the landlord class. In the movement to resist the United States and aid Korea, industrialists and merchants across the country have also rejected the propaganda toxins of imperialism and enhanced the spirit of patriotism. These are all commendable. We now ask industrialists and merchants across the country to further cut off the tails of feudalism and imperialism ideologically. We must resolutely remove the remnants of the old enemy's ideas in order to learn well from the workers and peasants and achieve rapid progress.
    Undoubtedly, in the past two years, the vast majority of industrialists and merchants have made great progress in their thinking. However, since ideological transformation is a long-term task, this progress, generally speaking, is certainly not enough. Specifically, although many industrialists and merchants have greatly improved their enthusiasm for management, many industrialists and merchants are still clinging to conservative ideas or adopting a hesitant attitude. The idea of ​​profiteering has certainly been greatly reduced; however, there are still some people who are exploiting loopholes to speculate and profiteer, and there are also some people who combine conservative ideas and the idea of ​​profiteering, trying to hoard and speculate. The abuse of apprentices is also heard from time to time in small shops and small workshops. There are still people who have formed small cliques and small circles, hoping to carry out unreasonable exploitation and plundering of the people. These are all serious violations of the spirit of patriotism and serving the people.
    The lessons of the past two years are like this: Those industrialists and merchants who sincerely accept the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government, enhance patriotism, fully exert their enthusiasm for management, and loyally and honestly serve the people, generally have achieved business development and are respected by the people; those industrialists and merchants who disregard the interests of the country and the people, do not actively operate their businesses, but engage in speculation, hoarding, and even tax evasion, generally encounter business setbacks and are even sanctioned by the people. On one side is a bright road, and on the other side is darkness and destruction; what to take and what to give up is not only clear, but the gains and losses and success and failure are also very clear. Therefore, finally, I would like to propose again: Industrialists and merchants across the country must further cut off the tails of feudalism and imperialism ideologically!

    从西南土地改革谈到民族工商业
    章乃器
    一这次到西南去参加土地改革工作，分配在川东合川县第四区，工作期间是六十五天。现在，把我对于土地改革和民族工商业者的关系的体验谈一谈。
    内地的工商业者有百分之九十以上和土地有关系。西南地区在土地改革以前都曾经进行过减租、退押运动，许多工商业者要拿出一些资金来退租、退押，这就相当地打击了他们的情绪，也影响了他们的活动资金。在土地改革开始的时候，乡镇的工商业者就害怕自己也要被打倒。他们怀疑：地主和工商业者同是剥削阶级，为什么一面打倒地主，一面又要保护民族工商业？
    实际上，地主和工商业者虽然都有剥削，但是剥削的性质是不相同的。地主阶级的剥削，是野蛮的超经济的阻碍着社会生产力发展的。为什么？这与它的衰老、顽固和落后是分不开的。
    “老而不死是为贼”。孔老夫子这句话对于人来说并不全对，对于历史上衰老没落的剥削阶级来说，却是毫无例外地适用的。当一个阶级变成了特权阶级，可以不劳而获、尽情享乐，可以肆无忌惮地剥削、压迫别人，它必然会变成非常保守、顽固、自私，而且残酷。地主阶级就是这样。作为一个地主，一般地只知道收租、享乐；只知道加重对于农民的剥削，以提高自己的享乐。对于经营的改善，农具、土壤的改良和水利的兴修，他们不但从不注意，而且往往绝不过问。由于一般地主只知损人利己，一味处心积虑占别人的便宜，没有一点向前发展的思想，他们性情的残酷是必然的。小说、戏剧上描写这种人非常阴险毒辣，那是事实。因此，不但从发展社会生产力的观点来说应该实行土地改革，就是从道义的观点来说，这种人也是应该打倒的。二
    川东土地的占有非常集中。合川县四区有一个村，百分之八的地主，占有全村土地百分之七十八点六。在重庆附近的农村中，地主阶级占有土地有达百分之九十五以上的。地主不但垄断了大量的土地，而且垄断了大量的房屋。在川东，一片土地上往往盖上一所佃户居住的房屋。乍一看，好像地主是很周到地替农民安排住屋，实际上却是一种最残酷的剥削方法。采取这种方法，农民要佃到地才能安家，夺了佃就丧了家。因此，农民对地主很难反抗；同时，地主对农民的经济情况却可以看得一清二楚。农民精耕细作，多下肥料，把田种好了，收成增多了，地主便要加租。农民从事副业生产，养了肥猪，或者包零工多得了一些收入，地主马上就要增加押金。如果农民不依，他就以夺佃来威胁；总要吸尽农民的脂膏，使他变成“干人”为止。在四川，一般地就是把贫苦的农民叫做“干人”的。
    四川有一首民谣说：“干人头上三把刀，重租、厚利、押金高。”四川地租之重，确为各省所少有：地租一般地达到土地正产的百分之八十；有的竟到百分之一百——这叫做“满租”。租佃条件也十分横暴：有所谓“铁板租”，租约中规定：“不问天灾水旱，不准短少升合；如有短欠，扣除押金。”剥削的方式更是无孔不入：有所谓“豆租”，就是说农民在田埂上种豆也要收租；还有“谷草租”，是说连稻草也要交一部分给地主。“天下乌鸦一般黑”，西南地主可能是最黑的一群。
    租太重了，明知农民纳不起，于是便要在出租土地的时候先收很高的押金，使农民无论如何都欠不了。农民从那里来这笔押金呢？那就往往只好借高利贷“饮鸩止渴”了。当然高利贷往往还是向地主阶级借的。一遇灾荒，地主有“铁板租”条款的保障，可以不受丝毫损失；农民便要丧失了押金，也就是承担了全部的天灾损失。
    加租、加押是毫无限制的。在解放以前的七八年期间中，由于土地占有进一步集中，地主更可以为所欲为。一年加租、加押一次是很普遍的；有的一年竟要加到两次。反动政权增加赋税和地方保甲的摊派，固然是用加租、加押的方式转嫁给农民；甚至地主家中的婚丧消耗，也要取偿于加租、加押。尤其残酷的是反动政权发行了几次的伪币，农民交押金时币值高，结算或退押金时币值低，那种货币贬值的损失，也往往转嫁给农民。
    经济上的剥削制度必然要有政治上的统治来维持。川东地主阶级的统治组织是很周密，而统治手段是很毒辣的。他们除了勾结反动党团，包办保甲之外，和土匪、特务、道门、帮会也打成一片。黑暗的统治笼罩了农村：农民稍有反抗，不是公开拘押，便是私刑拷打，甚至任意处死。反动政权的拉丁、拉夫等暴政，给地主阶级以更残酷的压迫农民的武器。妻离子散、家破人亡的灾祸，便成为农民的普遍遭遇了！
    事情很明白：农民不但生产情绪低落，而且穿不暖、吃不饱的结果，连从事劳动生产的体力也减弱了。在流离、逃亡当中，又要消耗大批的劳动力。所以，尽管要求种田的人多，农业生产力必然还是衰退下去，土地也由肥沃逐渐变为贫瘠了。由于农民购买力的衰退和农业的减产，更由于帝国主义商品的倾销，民族工商业便不可能发展。民族工商业家面对着反动政权摧残民族资本的虐政，旁边又有土地投资本稳利高的诱惑，一般地是两条心的，是没有经营积极性的。因此，资金纷纷流到土地上去，人口继续壅滞在农业里面，形成了土地占有更加集中、农业人口更加相对的过剩，而工商业更加不能发展的互为因果的循环。这就是川东在解放以前旧社会盘旋在绝望和堕落的泥淖里的惨况。刘少奇副主席在“关于土地改革问题的报告”里所说：
    “这就是我们民族被侵略、被压迫、穷困及落后的根源，是我们国家民主化、工业化、独立、统一及富强的基本障碍。”我们在土地改革工作当中已经得到充分的证明了。
    农民在谈话当中常常说：“倘使共产党再不来，我们真都活不下去了！”他们把中国共产党当作救命恩人，把毛主席当作大救星，的确是从心坎里流露出来的。中国农民是有革命传统的，那种极端黑暗的情况是不大可能再继续下去的。不是有一个由工人阶级领导的革命就可能是一个张献忠式的暴动。毛主席和中国共产党领导中国人民走上前一条路是十分正确的，是对国家和人民十分有利的。三
    我们已经知道：历史上的反动统治阶级总是不甘心于自己的灭亡的；它们在垂死以前的最后挣扎是疯狂的。但那内中的真实情况，我们是在参加了土地改革以后才体会得更深刻。那作为历代反动统治基础的地主阶级，久已习于不劳而获、养尊处优、颐指气使、横行霸道，要他们一旦放弃自己的特权，放下威风凛凛的架子，向过去认为是自己的“家奴”的农民群众低头认罪，并在劳动中改造自己，的确是一件难事。满清王朝“宁赠友邦，勿与家奴”的政策，就是这种思想造成的；而现在，一小撮的蒋匪帮还在勾结帝国主义幻想卷土重来，也正是这种思想的产物。地主阶级的顽强反抗，方式尽管不同，本质上是毫无二致的。
    西南解放以后，地主阶级在初期联合国民党残兵和土匪，公开武装叛乱，反抗征粮。土匪武装人数，一九五○年三四月间最多时曾达一百万人左右。他们的政治代表人，堂皇地驻在重庆、成都，公然向地方当局提出类似最后通牒的书面警告，要求对他们采取“妥协政策”。由于西南当局领导的正确，解放军指战员的英勇和广大人民的努力，西南全区展开了全面的剿匪运动以后，不到半年时间，大股土匪溃灭了。同年八九月间开始清剿土匪、反对恶霸、减租、退押运动，全区土匪基本肃清。地主阶级的反抗乃转入潜伏阶段；造谣、暗杀、投毒、破坏生产建设、幕后操纵农民协会等方式，普遍展开，直到土地改革时期，这一类的阴谋还不时发现。他们对于缴纳违法赔偿的顽抗和狡赖，更是花样百出，丑态万端。他们的最后挣扎的确是疯狂的。
    作为一个反动统治阶级及其成员，往往是剥削愈残酷、罪恶愈重大，最后挣扎也愈疯狂。革命人民对于他们唯一可能的答复是更加严重的打击，直至敌人无条件投降而后已。土地改革之所以必须是一场激烈的斗争，地主阶级长期的野蛮的剥削和压迫是一种原因，最后挣扎的疯狂是又一种原因。四
    中国现阶段的革命一面要消灭封建地主阶级，一面要保护工商业。作为一个阶级来看，民族工商业者的利害，和封建地主阶级的利害是相反的。中国民族工商业者之所以能够参加革命队伍，是因为他们还处在资本主义的青年时期；不但没有长成为一个足以妨害生产力发展的反动统治阶级，而且曾饱受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和摧残。中国的资本主义成分，在新民主主义条件下，可以经过节制与领导，向有利于国家与人民的方向发展；这又不同于那野蛮的妨碍生产力发展的封建剥削。因此，中国民族工商业者就具有发展爱国主义和从而产生的为人民服务的条件。中国民族工商业者具有这样的历史条件，就能够在“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的原则之下获得发展。
    在这里必须特别指出的是：中国民族工商业的发展要能符合“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的原则，工人阶级的领导是必不可少的。很明显，在解放以前，中国民族工商业者是没有前途的。那就因为缺少了工人阶级的领导。资本主义国家资产阶级自由竞争的发展更给我们以足够的教训。在那些国度里，资本家们已经由无限度地剥削劳工、掠夺殖民地人民，肆无忌惮地阻碍进步，损害国家和人民的利益，进到了为着扩大市场不惜制造战争，大肆疯狂屠杀了！他们的罪恶已经超过了地主阶级，他们不久要被彻底消灭已经不是理论上的推断，而是有了以俄国革命为首的一连串的历史事实证明的了。中国民族工商业者有了毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导，他们走向了新民主主义的光明大道，这是非常幸运的。五
    民族工商业者要发扬爱国主义精神，就要更好地为人民服务，主要的是为工农大众服务。在目下，农民占总人口的百分之八十以上；工人人口仅次于农民，他们在总人口中的比重是在迅速增长着。工农大众的购买力都在不断地提高。他们是新国家的基础，为他们服务不但是一件做不完的事业，而且是极其光荣，极其伟大的任务。
    在重视劳动，尊敬劳动人民的意义之下，我们民族工商业者一面为工农大众服务，一面还要向他们学习。要学习他们的忠诚老实的美德，学习他们的勤劳刻苦、努力生产的精神，更要学习他们的敌我分明、坚决斗争的意志。对于工人，我们还要学习他们的高瞻远瞩、大公无私、坚持真理、坚持进步、贯彻到底的可贵的特质。必须如此，我们工商业者才能摆脱原有的对于革命事业的两面性和软弱性，为新中国的建设奋斗到底。有了毛主席和中国共产党的领导，这是完全可以做到的。
    必须承认：我们这些在旧社会里长大起来的人们，是不可避免地沾染了许多旧社会的思想意识的。这些便是帝国主义和封建主义的思想意识。敌人的房屋、家具、器械、飞机、大炮，以至生产技术，我们都可以保留下来加以利用；敌人的思想意识却决不能加以保留和利用。然而，思想意识一经沾染上了之后，倒是一件最不容易去掉的东西。尤其是封建主义的思想意识，那根基的深固是决不下于封建主义的经济制度的。这种敌人的思想意识，过去曾经给我们以很大的毒害，使得我们犯了很多的错误，今后是必须加以彻底肃清了。
    帝国主义灌输给我们的思想意识，主要的是自由主义。自由主义一到中国，便在封建主义的散漫分裂的思想里面生了根，变成了脱离祖国的买办思想，和对国事不关心、对人民不负责的自私自利的个人主义和宗派主义。自由主义又在封建主义的超经济剥削意识里面生了根，成为殖民地式的原始积累的掠夺思想。从自由主义发展出来的独占思想，更在封建主义的行会意识里面生了根，成为殖民地式的垄断资本主义。这种种思想意识的结合，就在经济上发展而为官僚资本主义。官僚资本主义已经被我们打倒了，然而官僚资本主义的思想意识还没有被肃清。
    封建主义所遗留给我们的思想意识，主要的是保守观念，暴利思想和行会意识。这种种的思想意识，有的是以旧的落后方式出现的，有的是以帝国主义所灌输给我们的比较新的方式出现的。
    帝国主义和封建主义的思想意识，都是敌人的思想意识；但，封建主义的思想意识是更基本的。由于商业是在封建时代生长出来的。在中国有了久远的历史；所以，封建主义的思想意识，残存在旧工商业当中的要比残存在近代工商业当中的多得多。反之，帝国主义的思想意识，则残存在近代工商业当中的要比残存在旧工商业当中的多一些。这是民族工商业必须经过改组和工商企业必须进行民主改革的理由，也就是我们民族工商业者必须进行自我思想改造的理由。六
    西南民族工商业的领导同志在土地改革运动中，号召大家割断封建的尾巴，这是完全正确的。西南的民族工商业者多数是这样做了；他们勇敢地割断了土地的关系，有许多也割断与地主阶级的联系。在抗美援朝运动中，全国工商业者也已经摒斥了帝国主义的宣传毒素，提高了爱国主义的精神。这些都是值得称赞的。我们现在要求全国工商业者更进一步从思想上割断封建主义和帝国主义的尾巴。我们必须毅然决然地去掉旧的敌人的思想残余，才能很好地向工农学习而取得迅速的进步。
    毫无疑义，两年来，绝大多数的工商业者在思想上已经有了很大的进步。然而，由于思想改造是一个长期的工作，这一个进步一般说来，当然还是不够的。具体地说，虽然许多工商业者都已经大大地提高了经营的积极性，但是，不少的工商业者还在固执保守观念或者采取彷徨观望的态度。暴利思想固然是大大地减少了；但是，仍然有些人在钻空子投机取利，也还有些人结合了保守观念和暴利思想，尝试囤积居奇。小店铺和小作坊里面，虐待学徒的事情也时有所闻。结成了小宗派小圈子，希图对人民进行不合理的巧取豪夺的，也还有人在。这些都是严重地违反爱国主义和为人民服务的精神的。
    两年来事实的教训是这样：那些衷心接受毛主席、中国共产党和人民政府的领导，提高爱国主义，充分发挥经营的积极性，忠诚老实地为人民服务的工商业者，一般地都获得了事业上的发展，并得到人民的尊重；那些不顾国家和人民的利益，不积极经营事业，而从事于投机倒把，囤积居奇以至逃避税收的工商业者，一般地都遭遇到事业的挫败，甚至受到人民的制裁。一面是光明的大道，一面是黑暗与灭亡；何取何舍，不但是非分明，得失成败也是很分明的。因此，最后我愿意再提出：全国工商业者必须进一步从思想意识上割断封建主义和帝国主义的尾巴！
    一九五○、一○、一○，于北京。
