    *Shanghai News Daily* Accepts Criticism
    Begins to Pay Attention to the Seriousness of Film and Theater Advertisements

    Editor:

    On September 11th, *People's Daily* reader Comrade Deng Su raised objections to three film and theater advertisements published in our newspaper's theater program advertisement section on August 31st. These three film and theater advertisements were: an image from "Blood Sea of ​​Revenge," the Cantonese opera advertisement's play title "Winning the Reputation of a Heartless Man in a Brothel," and the slapstick comedy "Little Taoist Arrives in Shanghai" advertisement's phrases "Thousands upon Thousands of Laughs, Overwhelming Gags," etc. We accept this positive suggestion.

    Due to our insufficient understanding and the lingering presence of some old consciousness, we published these advertisements without careful selection. In the future, we will not only promptly correct the inappropriate images and exaggerated wording in the advertisements, but also pay more attention to the seriousness and authenticity of the advertisements. We will do a good job in promoting theater programs and better serve the people. We extend our sincere thanks to Comrade Deng Su and *People's Daily*.

                                            Advertising Department, *Shanghai News Daily*

### 上海新闻日报接受批评  开始注意影剧广告的严肃性

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    上海新闻日报接受批评
    开始注意影剧广告的严肃性编辑同志：
    九月十一日人民日报读者邓速同志对本报八月三十一日戏目广告版内刊载的三则影剧广告提出意见。这三则影剧广告是：“血海仇”的图片，粤剧广告的剧名“赢得青楼薄幸名”，和滑稽剧“小道士到上海”广告内“笑料成千成万，噱头排山倒海”等词句。我们接受这个积极的建议。
    由于我们的认识不够，还多少存在一些旧的意识，以致不加选择地刊载了这些广告。今后，我们不仅要及时纠正广告中的不好的图片和夸大的辞句，更应该注意广告的严肃性、真实性。我们要做好戏目广告的宣传，更好地为人民服务。我们向邓速同志和人民日报谨致恳挚的感谢。
                                            上海新闻日报广告科
