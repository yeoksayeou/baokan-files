Xinhua News Agency, 5th: TASS, 3rd—While the expansion of armaments and American aggression bring huge profits to Japanese monopoly capitalists, the situation of the Japanese working masses is getting worse and worse. The American "Far Eastern Economic Review," in discussing the impact of the Korean War on the plight of the Japanese people, pointed out: Last year, the Japanese standard of living was only 74 percent of the level of 1934-1936. In a recent public opinion poll sponsored by the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," most of those surveyed said that life was much more difficult than in 1950 because prices had risen sharply. According to the Japanese "Economic Stabilization Board," textiles alone rose by 7.2 percent in the week from August 26 to September 1. According to figures from the Statistics Office of the Occupation Headquarters, food prices in August rose by 15.1 percent compared with July.

    Living conditions have also deteriorated, and the meager funds allocated for housing construction cannot meet the needs of residents. The "Japan Times" estimates that at the current rate of housing construction, it will take at least twenty years to prepare housing for all homeless people.

    "Canadian Star Weekly" wrote: Poverty and disappointment have become a common phenomenon in Japan. The number of suicides and crimes is increasing, and selling children is extremely popular.

    侵朝战争促使日本物价猛涨
    日本人民生活益贫穷
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社三日讯：当扩军运动和美国侵略给日本垄断资本家带来巨额利润的时候，日本劳动大众的情况却越来越坏。美国的“远东评论”报在谈到朝鲜战争对于日本人民境遇的影响时指出：去年日本生活水平只及一九三四年—一九三六年水平的百分之七十四。日本“每日新闻”最近所主办的民意测验中，大部分被测验的人都说，生活比一九五○年时要困难得多了，因为物价已急剧上涨。据日本“经济安定本部”公布，仅从八月二十六日至九月一日的一周中，纺织品即已上涨百分之七·二，据占领军总部统计处的数字，八月份的食物价格和七月份比较起来，已上涨百分之十五·一。
    居住条件也已变坏，拨供建造房屋的微不足道的款项不能满足居民的需要。“日本时报”估计，照现在建造房屋的速度来看，为所有无家可归的人准备住宅至少需要二十年。
    “加拿大明星周刊”写道：贫穷和失望已成为日本的普遍现象。自杀犯罪的人数正在增加，卖孩子的事极为流行。
