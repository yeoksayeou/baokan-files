    Stalin's Talk on Atomic Weapons Inspires the World's People in the Struggle for Peace

    To the Editor:

    On the morning of the 7th, the students in our dormitory were very happy to read the article published in the People's Daily about Stalin's talk on the atomic weapons issue. After we received the newspaper, because there were so many people, we elected a student to read it aloud. After he finished reading, everyone applauded and cheered enthusiastically, feeling indescribable excitement and joy!

    Before this, the remnants of "fear of America" thought in individual students had not been completely eliminated, mainly because they were deceived by the deceptive propaganda of the American atomic warmongers. Now America's atomic blackmail has completely gone bankrupt. These students' ideological concerns have also been eliminated.

    Stalin's talk, as the People's Daily editorial said, is a great gospel of world peace. Because the Soviet Union has mastered atomic weapons, it has greatly strengthened the power and confidence of the people of the world in defending peace. Stalin's talk also exposed the hypocritical lies of American imperialism's so-called "control of atomic weapons" and seriously undermined its aggressive conspiracy.

    After reading the newspaper, we all firmly stated that we would improve our health, study hard, and become people's teachers with both talent and virtue, and with healthy bodies, ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland, and strive to build the motherland and defend world peace!

### 斯大林关于原子武器的谈话鼓舞了世界争取和平的人民

    斯大林关于原子武器的谈话鼓舞了世界争取和平的人民编辑同志：
    七日上午，我们宿舍里的同学，十分高兴地读到了人民日报登载的斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话。我们接到报纸后，因为人多，就公推一个同学朗读。在他读完以后，大家都热烈地鼓掌欢呼，感到说不出的兴奋和愉快！
    在这以前，个别同学的“恐美”思想的残余还没有彻底肃清，主要的原因是受了美国原子黩武主义者的欺骗宣传。现在美国的原子讹诈已经完全破产了。这些同学的思想顾虑也就消除了。
    斯大林的谈话，正如人民日报的社论所说，是世界和平的伟大福音。因为苏联掌握了原子武器，就大大地加强了全世界人民保卫和平的力量和信心。斯大林的谈话同时也揭破了美帝国主义的所谓“管制原子武器”的伪善谎言，严重地打击了它的侵略阴谋。
    我们读报以后，都坚决表示要练好身体，学好功课，做一个才德兼备、体格健全的人民教师，随时准备响应祖国的号召，为建设祖国与保卫世界和平而奋斗！
