The instructor of the "Huangcaoling Hero Company" of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Li Zhaoqin

    Last winter, when the invading American forces were frantically pushing north, threatening our country's security, we resolutely joined the Volunteer Army. Shortly after going abroad, we engaged with the American and South Korean bandit troops in the area north of Hamhung on the east coast of Korea. Our company was ordered by our superiors to block the advancing enemy and defend the vital Huangcaoling position on the Hamhung-Changjin highway. On the night of October 27th, as our company had just entered the position and before fortifications could be dug, the enemy concentrated a large battalion of troops and began attacking us under the cover of artillery fire. At this time, we used our backpacks as fortifications, quickly deployed our forces, and decided to strike when the enemy was only forty or fifty meters away. Soon, a group of enemies climbed up like mad dogs. Our machine guns and hand grenades were fired at the enemy simultaneously.
    At this time, the fifth squad threw five hand grenades, driving the enemy down the hill howling and screaming, leaving behind five or six corpses. That night alone, the enemy launched six consecutive attacks, each suffering severe losses.
    After the enemy's nighttime attacks were frustrated, they concentrated intense artillery fire the next day to cover a company's worth of troops in a fierce attack on the second platoon's position, aided by eight aircraft strafing and bombing wildly. The front and rear of the position were ablaze, and the trees and dry grass burned like a sea of fire. The enemy stealthily climbed up the mountain in this smoke-filled environment. The soldiers squatted in the fortifications, calmly waiting for the enemy to come up. Machine gunner Zhu Pike carefully observed the enemy's movements and told his comrades: "Prepare the hand grenades, and when the enemy comes up and my machine gun fires, everyone attacks together." The comrades replied, "Okay, let's do that." As they spoke, the enemy approached step by step. With a burst of fierce machine gun fire and grenade explosions, five or six enemies were knocked down, and the rest scattered and retreated. At this time, Yu Renyi was wounded, but he resolutely refused to leave the front line. He said: "Being wounded is nothing, holding the hilltop is the important thing. As long as we are determined, no matter how many enemies there are or how intense the artillery fire is, we are confident that we can defeat them." Finally, he said to everyone: "Comrades, overcoming difficulties is equivalent to defeating the enemy."
    We had already held our ground for a day and two nights, repelling twelve enemy attacks. The troops were hungry, thirsty, and sleepy. Zhu Pike came up with a way to quench their thirst: eating toothpaste; digging out grass roots from the fortifications and chewing them. That is how everyone overcame the difficulty of thirst. Although there were such serious difficulties in the battle, our people's soldiers were able to endure them, overcome them, and defeat them.
    Each enemy attack resulted in a heavy defeat, with casualties all over the field, but their ambition did not die. The 26th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the South Korean army continued to attack us, with more than twenty aircraft taking turns strafing and bombing, and fierce artillery fire pounding, creating a cloud of smoke on the hilltop, and shattering the rocks. At the most intense moment of the battle, I said to everyone: "We must resolutely hold the position and fight the first battle abroad well!" Before I finished speaking, Communist Party member Wang Xinyi replied: "Fight the first battle abroad well and win glory for the motherland!" As soon as the artillery fire eased a little, Wang Zhenda convened a temporary small group meeting of Communist Party members to discuss how to repel the enemy's attack.
    No matter how the enemy bombarded and attacked, the comrades on the position were very calm. Everyone encouraged each other and competed with each other. Soldier Xu Huiyi said to the deputy company commander: "As long as our fifth squad is here, the position is here, and we cannot lose the position even if only one person remains." Hu Zhongfang, the deputy squad leader of the machine gun squad, hugged the machine gun under his body to prevent the weapon from being damaged. When the enemy came up, he picked it up and fired. As the artillery fire intensified, I said to everyone: "Comrades, today is the time for us to refine steel, and true gold is not afraid of fire." Communist Party member Wang Zhenda replied: "We are steel, not afraid of fire, we must resolutely hold the position and fight for the safety of the motherland." As soon as he finished speaking, the comrades said in unison: "We are steel, not afraid of fire, we must resolutely hold the position." But at this time, there were not many hand grenades left. The comrades said: Even if we run out of ammunition and food, we must find a way to overcome the difficulties. Everyone suggested using stones to fight. The third squad alone repelled the attack of more than forty enemies with hand grenades and stones.
    Just as the fighting was at its most intense, the regimental commander called, ordering our company to resolutely hold out until 4:30 in the afternoon. The regimental commander said: Our artillery fire and our main force are about to attack the enemy. I replied at the time: "Okay! We are confident that we can hold the position, please rest assured, commander. As long as there are people, the position is here."
    I told the troops what the regimental commander had said, and everyone replied:
    "It doesn't matter if we have to hold out for a few more days and nights."
    Each enemy attack was repelled by us. The fighting had been going on for too long, the bullets were running out, the machine guns were damaged, and there were not many hand grenades left. We put forward the slogan of "three no-attacks" at the time: First, don't attack unless the enemy is close. Second, don't attack if you can't see the enemy. Third, don't attack if you can't hit accurately. While telling everyone to save bullets, I organized sharpshooters to fire volley shots at the enemy.
    This battle lasted for two days and three nights. Although every comrade's eyes were red, and they were hungry and thirsty, the soldiers still widened their eyes, tightly grasped their hand grenades, and watched the enemy's movements, ready to eliminate the invading enemy at any time. Later, the entire company had only twenty-five hand grenades left, but the enemy's last attack was still repelled by us, and they ran back in a disarray. Finally, our powerful brother units began to attack the enemy, and we followed up with the main force, crushing the South Korean army's Third Division's attack on Huangcaoling.
    In these two days and three nights, we cooperated with the main force, defeating the enemy's attacks more than twenty times. Our company killed and wounded more than two hundred and fifty enemies, completing the glorious task assigned to our company by our superiors to hold the Huangcaoling position and block the enemy. After the battle, we were awarded the title of "Huangcaoling Hero Company" by our superiors, and the entire company collectively received a first-class merit. This battle was our first battle after going abroad, and it was also our first experience fighting against the American and South Korean bandit troops.
    Since then, our troops have continued to advance southward, one victory after another. Although we are armed with light weapons, we have driven the enemy from the Yalu River to beyond the 38th parallel. The reason for this is none other than that the war we are waging is a just war—a war to defend the motherland and a war for the Korean people.
    Looking back on our operations over the past year, we have also experienced many difficulties and setbacks, but we have overcome them all. The soldiers often talked about: "There are no insurmountable difficulties in front of the people's soldiers."
    Over the past year, our entire company has participated in twelve major and minor battles, capturing one hundred and thirteen American and South Korean bandit troops alive, killing and wounding four hundred and two enemies, and seizing two hundred various artillery pieces, one hundred and three various guns, one radio station, and one field telephone. Now our position is tightly confronting the enemy, and the enemy is firing artillery at us every day, trying to invade us. We are closely watching the enemy's offense, and if the enemy dares to attack our position, we will let them come up alive and die on the front lines of our position. This is my determination, the determination of all comrades in our company, and the determination of all volunteer soldiers on the front lines in Korea.
    On the eve of the first anniversary of our going abroad to fight, I, on behalf of all the comrades of the "Huangcaoling Hero Company," express our determination to the people of the motherland from the front lines: We vow to fight to the end to defend the security of the motherland and for the final victory of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes!

    出国作战第一功
    中国人民志愿军“黄草岭英雄连”指导员  李兆勤
    去年冬天，当侵朝美军正在疯狂北犯，威胁我国安全的时候，我们毅然地参加了志愿军。出国不久，我们就在朝鲜东海岸咸兴以北地区，与美李匪军接火。我们连奉上级命令，阻击北犯的敌人，坚守由咸兴到长津公路上的黄草岭险要阵地。十月二十七日的夜晚，我们连刚刚进入阵地，工事还没有挖，敌人就集中了一个大队的兵力，在炮火掩护下开始向我们进攻。这时，我们就用背包作工事，很快布置好了兵力，决定等敌人离我们四、五十公尺的时候才打。一会儿，一群敌人疯狗似的爬上来了。我们的机枪、手榴弹一齐打向敌人。
    这时五班打了五个手榴弹，就把敌人打得狼哭鬼叫地往下滚，丢下了五、六个尸首。就在那一个夜晚，敌人连续进攻了六次，每次都遭受了严重的损失。
    敌人在夜间的进攻受到挫折以后，在第二天集中了强烈的炮火，掩护一个连的兵力向我们连二排的阵地猛扑，并有八架飞机配合疯狂扫射和轰炸。阵地的前后都打着了火，树枝和枯草烧得像一片火海，敌人就在这烟雾弥漫中，偷偷地往山上爬。战士们蹲在工事里，沉着地等待敌人上来。机枪射手朱丕克仔细地观察敌人的活动，他告诉同志们说：“准备好手榴弹，等敌人上来，我的机枪一叫，大家一起打。”同志们回答：“好，咱们就这么干。”说着，敌人一步步地逼近啦，随着一阵激烈的机枪声、手榴弹声，敌人被打倒了五、六个，剩下的七零八落溃退下去了。这时，于仁义负伤啦，可是他坚决不下火线。他说：“挂彩不算什么，守住山头是要紧的。只要我们有决心，不管敌人有多少，炮火怎样猛，我们也有把握把它打下去。”最后他又向大家说：“同志们，克服困难，就等于战胜敌人。”
    我们已经固守了一天两夜，打退了敌人十二次的进攻。部队又饿又渴，又瞌睡，朱丕克想出解渴的办法：吃牙膏；从工事里挖出草根子放到嘴里嚼。大家就这样地过了口渴这一难关。虽然战斗中有这么严重的困难，但是我们人民的战士能够忍受它，克服它，战胜它。
    敌人每一次的进攻，都遭到惨重的失败，伤亡遍野，但它的野心还不死。李伪军三师二十六纵队还是不断向我们进攻，他们以二十多架飞机轮番扫射和轰炸，又以猛烈炮火轰击，打得山头上一片浓烟，石头都崩碎啦。打得最激烈的时候，我对大家说：“我们要坚决守住阵地，打好出国第一仗！”我的话还没有完，共产党员王新一回答说：“打好出国第一仗，为祖国争光！”炮火刚刚打得比较松一些，王振达就召集共产党员开了一个临时的小组会，研究怎样打退敌人的进攻。
    不管敌人怎样轰击和进攻，阵地上的同志都是很沉着的。大家互相鼓励，互相竞赛。战士许惠义对副连长说：“有我们五班在，就有阵地在，剩一个人也不能把阵地丢掉。”机枪班副班长胡忠方，为了不使武器受损失，便把机枪抱在身子下面。敌人上来啦，他端起来就打。炮火越打越急，我又对大家说：“同志们，今天就是我们炼钢炼铁的时候，真金是不怕火炼的。”共产党员王振达回答说：“我们是钢，不怕火炼，我们要坚决守住阵地，为祖国的安全而战。”他的话刚说完，同志们异口同声地说：“我们是钢，不怕火炼，坚决守住阵地。”可是这时，手榴弹也不多啦，同志们说：就是弹尽粮绝，也得想法克服困难。大家提议用石头打。就仅仅三班一个组，就用手榴弹和石头打退四十多个敌人的进攻。
    正打得最激烈，团首长来电话啦，命令我们连坚决要守到下午四点半。团首长说：我们的炮火，我们的主力就要向敌人进攻啦。我当时回答：“行！有把握守住阵地，请首长放心，有人在，就有阵地在。”
    我把团首长来的电话向部队一讲，大家回答说：
    “再守几天几夜，也没有关系。”
    敌人每次进攻，都叫我们打退。时间打得太长啦，子弹快完，机枪也打坏，手榴弹也不多啦。我们当时提出了“三不打”的口号：第一，敌人不靠近不打。第二，看不见敌人不打。第三，打不准不打。我一面告诉大家节省子弹，一面组织步枪特等射手，向敌人打排子枪。
    这次战斗，打了两天三夜，虽然每个同志的眼睛都发红了，又饥又饿，但战士们仍然瞪大了两个眼睛，紧紧握住手榴弹，注视着敌人的行动，随时准备消灭进犯的敌人。后来，全连仅仅剩下了二十五个手榴弹啦，可是敌人最后一次的进攻，仍旧被我们打退，连滚带爬跑了回去。最后，我们强大的兄弟部队开始向敌人进攻了，我们在主力的配合下，也随着打了下去，粉碎了李伪军第三师向黄草岭的进攻。
    在这两天三夜中，我们配合主力，打垮了敌人二十多次进攻，我们的连队杀伤了敌人二百五十余名，完成了上级交给我们连的固守黄草岭阵地阻击敌人的光荣任务。战后，我们荣获上级嘉奖为“黄草岭英雄连”的称号，全连集体立大功一次。这个战斗，就是我们出国后的第一仗，也是我们第一次和美李匪军作战的经过。
    从此，我们的部队，连续地向南进军，一个胜利接着一个胜利。虽然我们手中拿的是轻武器，但我们把敌人从鸭绿江边赶过了三八线。这个原因不是别的，就是因为我们所进行的战争是正义的战争——为保卫祖国而战，为朝鲜人民而战。
    回想我们一年来在作战当中，也经历了不少的困难和曲折，但是，我们都把它克服啦。战士们经常地在谈论着：“在人民战士面前，没有克服不了的困难。”
    一年来，我们全连共参加大小战斗十二次，活捉美李匪军一百一十三名，毙伤敌人四百零二名，缴获各种炮二百门、各种枪一百零三支、电台一部和报话机一部。现在我们的阵地紧紧和敌人对峙，每天敌人都在向我们打炮，企图向我们进犯。我们正严密地注视着敌人的冒犯，假如敌人胆敢向我们阵地进攻，我们就叫它活着上来，死在我们阵地的前沿。这是我的决心，我们连全体同志的决心，也是所有在朝鲜前线志愿军全体同志的决心。
    在我们出国作战一周年的前夕，我在前线阵地上，代表“黄草岭英雄连”全体同志，向祖国人民表示决心：我们誓为保卫祖国的安全，为抗美援朝保家卫国的最后胜利而战斗到底！
