    Promote "Teaching Covenants" to Run Rural Primary Schools Well
    The "Teaching Covenant" created by the Xiangyuan County Education Trade Union in Shanxi Province has been proven, through experimentation and promotion, to be a good way to run rural primary schools well. Their covenants are all formulated based on the specific circumstances of the time and place. For example, the Beihe Primary School and Yangzhuang Primary School of the Wangcun grassroots trade union used to collapse every year. After teachers, cadres, parents, and children held joint discussions, everyone realized that the reasons for the school's collapse were mainly due to teachers not working hard enough in teaching; cadres not caring about schools and teachers; and parents feeling that children were not learning anything and were unwilling to send their children to school. They then adopted a democratic approach and formulated a "Teaching Covenant," the content of which is: 1. Teachers, cadres, parents, and children should maintain close contact and discuss matters together; 2. Teachers guarantee to run the school well and teach students well, and implement democratic management for children; parents guarantee to send their children to school and provide stationery and books; cadres guarantee to care about the school and solve the school's difficulties; 3. A parents' representative meeting will be held once a month to study and review the school's leadership work; children will report their academic performance to their parents once a week; at the end of the semester, a student achievement exhibition will be held to invite parents to visit. Since the covenant was established, the number of children enrolled in Yangzhuang Primary School has increased from seventeen to thirty-four; at the same time, students have also settled down to study. This fact shows that after the implementation of the teaching covenant in various schools, the school and the masses have further established close ties and received help from the masses; the sense of responsibility of village cadres has also been greatly strengthened, enabling the school's difficulties to be properly and reasonably resolved; and the teachers' professional thinking has also been greatly strengthened. We believe that this is a way to improve rural primary school education with revolutionary spirit. As long as cadres, teachers, and parents can seriously discuss and then formulate a practical "Teaching Covenant," and jointly abide by it and implement it, it can make rural primary schools run well.

    推广“教学公约”，办好农村小学
    山西省襄垣县教育工会创造的“教学公约”经过试验推广，已证明是办好农村小学校的一个好办法。他们的公约，都是根据当时当地的具体情况订立的，如王村基层工会北河小学及杨庄小学，过去是年年垮台，经过教师、干部、家长、儿童共同座谈、讨论以后，大家认识到学校垮台的原因主要是由于教员不努力教学；干部不关心学校、教师；家长嫌儿童学不到东西，不愿送儿童入学。他们便采取了民主方式，订立了一个“教学公约”，其内容是：一、教师、干部、家长、儿童经常密切联系，有事共同商量；二、教员保证办好学校教好学生、对儿童实行民主管理，家长保证送子女入学、供应文具书籍，干部保证关心学校、解决学校困难；三、每月召开家长代表会议一次，研究和检查学校的领导工作；儿童每周向家长报告一次学习成绩；学期终了，举行学生成绩展览会，请家长参观。自这个公约订立以后，杨庄小学的入学儿童就由十七名增加到三十四名；同时学生也安心学习了。这一事实说明：各校推行了教学公约以后，学校和群众进一步取得了密切的联系，得到群众帮助；村干部责任心也大为加强，使学校的困难获得适当合理的解决；教员的专业思想也大大的加强了。我们认为，这是一种用革命精神来改进农村小学教育工作的办法，只要干部、教师、家长能够认真地讨论，然后订出切实可行的“教学公约”，共同遵守，共同执行，是能使农村小学办好的。
