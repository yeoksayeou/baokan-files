(Xinhua News Agency, 18th) The Central People's Government Northeast Flood Relief Delegation, having completed its mission in the Northeast, left Shenyang on September 27th and returned to Beijing. On the 12th of this month, the delegation presented a report on its work at the 106th Government Affairs Meeting of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council.

The report stated: The purpose of the delegation's visit to the Northeast was to express condolences to the disaster victims in the flood-stricken areas of the Northeast and to further understand the disaster relief situation in the Northeast. The delegation departed from Beijing on September 10th and arrived in Shenyang on the 11th. On the 12th, it began to express condolences in the disaster areas, visiting Kaiyuan County in Liaoxi Province, Changchun County in Jilin Province, the suburbs of Harbin in Songjiang Province, the suburbs of Shenyang, and Haicheng County in Liaodong Province. The delegation conveyed to the disaster victims in various places the deep concern of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, commended the meritorious troops and government workers who rescued disaster victims in various places, and sent a letter of thanks to Colonel Durasov, the Soviet director of the Shenyang Branch of the China Changchun Railway, for rescuing over two hundred disaster victims from the water in Kaiyuan. At the same time, the delegation took the opportunity to inspect the Erlongshan Reservoir on the Dongliao River and the Harbin River embankment.

The report stated: The floods in the Northeast this year were mainly due to excessive rainfall in the Liao River and Songhua River basins in mid-to-late August, and the concentrated rainfall led to flash floods and riverbank breaches. About 1.7 million people were affected in Liaoxi, Liaodong, Songjiang, Jilin, Heilongjiang provinces and the suburbs of Shenyang, and more than 950,000 hectares (each hectare equals 15 mu) of land were flooded, with the disaster being most severe in Kaiyuan, Dongfeng, Tieling, Xifeng and other places in the upper reaches of the Liao River and the suburbs of Shenyang. The lower reaches of the Liao River, below Shenyang, including Xinmin, Liaozhong, Tai'an, Panshan, Liaoyang, Haicheng and other places, suffered less damage because of prior preparation and the reinforcement of the dikes on both sides of the Liao River this spring. The Songhua River began to rise in late August. In early September, villages and settlements in low-lying areas along the Nen River and Songhua River were flooded. Some embankments of the Heihe and other tributaries of the Heilongjiang Province also breached in late August, flooding more than 50,000 hectares of land.

The report stated: After the floods occurred, Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman, immediately personally arranged rescue work, instructing the disaster-stricken areas in the upper reaches of the rivers to do their best to rescue the disaster victims, the downstream areas to step up dike protection, and to evacuate residents in low-lying areas. Local governments mobilized a total of 14,000 working cadres and 338,000 people to participate in the rescue, and the People's Air Force and local troops also actively participated in the rescue, thus greatly reducing the area affected by the floods and reducing the losses caused by the disaster. It is understood that more than 40,000 disaster victims were rescued from the water in Kaiyuan County and the suburbs of Shenyang alone, and a total of 130,000 people were rescued from the water in Liaoxi Province.

The troops stationed in various parts of the Northeast, the working cadres of governments at all levels, and the medical personnel in various places, fully demonstrated the spirit of loving the people and fraternal mutual assistance in this rescue work, which greatly moved the disaster victims in various places and greatly boosted the confidence of the disaster victims in overcoming the famine through production. When the floods occurred, thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed in Kaiyuan immediately organized three rescue teams. Regardless of the danger to their lives, and regardless of the cold and fatigue, they fought the flood like they were on the battlefield. Soldiers with boats steered their boats, and those without boats used rafts, rubber tire belts, or went into the water to rescue people. They rescued a total of five to six thousand disaster victims in one day. In the muddy areas after the water receded, where boats could not travel, some soldiers crawled on the mud to deliver food to the disaster victims. Some cadres and masses even disregarded their own safety and displayed a high degree of self-sacrifice and class fraternity to rescue disaster victims. When Meng Xianlin, the transportation commissioner of Houshijiapu Village in the 11th District of Kaiyuan County, went out in a boat to rescue people, his house was washed away by the flood, his wife and children were crushed to death in the house, and his mother's life was also in danger. When others persuaded him to go home and take a look, he said, "Hundreds of people are coming down the river, and there are only three people in my family. I still have to save everyone." He rescued sixteen people in a row. In a village in Haicheng County, more than 30 farmers, led and encouraged by Communist Party members, used their bodies as dikes, which ultimately prevented the embankment from collapsing, saving the entire village from flooding. Many disaster victims, after being rescued from the water, contracted eye diseases, dysentery, malaria, and even paratyphoid fever. Many medical personnel carried their medicine kits on their heads, waded through the mud, and went to the disaster areas to treat the disaster victims.

After the rescue work was completed, governments at all levels immediately set up temporary reception centers and aid stations near the disaster areas to prevent the disaster victims from suffering from cold and hunger. People in non-disaster areas launched a movement to increase production and provide disaster relief, enthusiastically helping their disaster-stricken compatriots. On September 10th, the Northeast People's Government convened a meeting of responsible cadres from provinces, cities, and severely affected counties to discuss flood relief. Provinces and cities also generally convened disaster relief meetings around September 20th to arrange for assisting disaster victims in building houses and restoring production. At present, more than one million disaster victims in the Northeast have been properly resettled, and the disaster victims are in good spirits. They all said: With Chairman Mao's leadership and their own two hands, they are not afraid of anything. At present, with the support of the People's Government, the disaster victims in various places are actively building houses, planning production, and rebuilding their homes.

The report believes that the Northeast governments at all levels have attached great importance to this flood and have made considerable achievements in flood prevention, rescue, and resettlement of disaster victims. The people of all provinces and cities in the Northeast are very enthusiastic about helping disaster victims. For example, after Liaoxi Province launched a campaign to raise 200,000 sets of cotton clothes for disaster victims, the number of pledges from various places has now reached 400,000 sets. This proves that the disaster victims in the Northeast are fully guaranteed to quickly overcome the famine and restore production. The key to future disaster relief work in the Northeast lies in how to further strengthen organizational leadership and make the work more meticulous and in-depth. The report suggests that the Northeast governments at all levels must continue to strengthen supervision, inspection, and guidance of disaster relief work, mobilize the masses through the people's representative conferences in the disaster areas, and formulate specific and effective measures for overcoming the famine through production. At the same time, attention must also be paid to water management and disaster prevention. A comprehensive management plan for the Liao River, Songhua River and other rivers should be formulated as soon as possible, and the water conservancy agencies at all levels should be appropriately strengthened or expanded. In future water management work, the agricultural, forestry, railway, and industrial and mining institutions in various parts of the Northeast must cooperate closely, mobilize the masses to dig more drainage ditches and gullies, pay attention to soil and water conservation and forest and mountain protection, and actively prevent the occurrence of floods.

    中央东北水灾慰问团向政务院报告工作
    东北政府和人民积极防汛抢救和安置灾民
    灾民战胜灾荒和恢复生产是完全有保证的 【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府东北水灾慰问团在东北完成任务后，已在九月二十七日离开沈阳返回北京。本月十二日，慰问团在中央人民政府政务院第一百零六次政务会议上作了关于该团的工作报告。
    报告称：慰问团这次到东北是为了慰问东北水灾区灾民，并进一步了解东北的救灾情况。慰问团九月十日从北京出发，十一日到达沈阳，十二日开始到灾区慰问，先后到达辽西省的开原县、吉林省的长春县、松江省的哈尔滨市郊区、沈阳市郊区，以及辽东省的海城县等地。慰问团向各地灾民传达了毛主席和中央人民政府对他们的深切关怀，嘉奖了各地抢救灾民的有功部队和政府工作人员，并致函在开原从水中救出二百多灾民的中长路沈阳分局苏籍局长杜拉索夫上校表示谢意。同时，该团并乘便视察了东辽河二龙山水库和哈尔滨江堤。
    报告称：今年东北发生的水灾，主要是因为八月中、下旬辽河流域和松花江流域的雨量太大，降雨时间又很集中，以致山洪暴发，河堤漫决。辽西、辽东、松江、吉林、黑龙江等省及沈阳市郊共有约一百七十万人受灾，有九十五万多垧（每垧合十五市亩）地被淹，其中尤以辽河上游的开原、东丰、铁岭、西丰等地及沈阳市郊区的灾情最重。辽河下游沈阳市以下，新民、辽中、台安、盘山、辽阳、海城等地，因为事先有了防备，今年春天又培修过辽河两岸的堤防，所以受灾较轻。松花江在八月下旬开始涨水，九月初，嫩江和松花江沿岸洼地的村屯都受到水灾；黑龙江省的黑河等河干支流在八月下旬也有部分堤岸决口，淹地五万多垧。
    报告称：水灾发生后，东北人民政府高岗主席、林枫副主席立即亲自布置抢救工作，指示河流上游被灾地区全力抢救灾民，下游地区加紧护堤，并疏散洼地居民。各地人民政府先后共动员了一万四千工作干部和三十三万八千群众参加抢救，人民空军及各地驻军也积极参加抢救，因此大大缩小了各地受水灾的面积，减少了灾害造成的损失。据了解：仅开原县和沈阳市郊从水中得救的灾民就有四万多人，辽西一省共从水中救出十三万人。
    东北各地驻军、各级人民政府工作干部，以及各地的医务人员，在这次抢救灾民工作中充分发挥了热爱人民和友爱互助的精神，使各地灾民非常感动，并大大鼓舞了灾民生产度荒的信心。当水灾发生后，驻在开原的人民解放军战士数千人，立即组织了三个抢救大队，他们不顾生命危险，不顾寒冷疲困，像在战场一样与洪水展开搏斗。有船的战士驾着船，无船的用木筏、胶皮车轮带或者只身下水救人，他们一天之内共救出灾民五、六千人。在水退后的泥泞地带，船只无法行驶，有些战士便在泥地上爬行，给灾民送粮食。有些干部和群众更是奋不顾身，发挥了高度的自我牺牲和阶级友爱的精神，抢救灾民。开原县十一区后施家堡村的交通委员孟宪林驾船出去救人时，他家的房子被洪水冲塌，老婆、孩子被压死在屋里，母亲生命也有危险，别人劝他回家看看，他说：“河里下来好几百人，我家只三口人，我还得救大家。”他连续抢救了十六个人。海城县某村的农民三十多人在共产党员的带头鼓动下以肉身当堤，终使堤岸没有塌陷，使全村群众免受水灾。许多灾民从水中被救出以后，又染上眼病、痢疾、疟疾，甚至副伤寒等病，许多医务人员就头顶着药箱，涉着泥泞，到灾区为灾民治病。
    抢救工作结束后，各级人民政府立即在各地灾区附近为灾民设立了临时招待所和救护站，使灾民不致受冻、受饿；非灾区的人民纷纷发起增产救灾运动，热烈救助灾胞。九月十日，东北人民政府曾召集各省、市及重灾县负责干部开水灾救济会议；各省、市也在九月二十日左右普遍召开了救灾会议，布置协助灾民修建房屋和恢复生产等工作。现在，东北一百多万灾民都得到了妥善的安置，灾民的情绪都很好。他们一致表示：有毛主席领导，自己又有两只手，什么都不怕。目前，各地灾民在人民政府支持下，正在积极地修盖房屋，筹划生产，重建家园。
    报告认为：东北各级人民政府对这次水灾很重视，在防汛、抢救和安置灾民工作上都有相当大的成绩。东北各省、市人民对救助灾民的工作很热心，如辽西省发起为灾民募集二十万套棉衣运动后，到现在，各地认捐的数字已有了四十万套。由此证明，东北灾民迅速战胜灾荒，恢复生产，是完全有保证的。东北今后救灾工作的关键，在于如何更进一步加强组织领导，使工作更加细致与深入。报告建议东北各级人民政府必须继续加强督促、检查和指导救灾工作，通过灾区人民代表会议，发动群众，订出具体有效的生产度荒办法。同时，还须重视治水和防灾的工作，应从速制订出辽河、松花江等河流的通盘治理计划，适当加强或扩充各级水利机构。在今后的治水工作中，东北各地的农林、铁道、厂矿等方面的机构必须密切配合，并发动群众多挖排水沟洫，注意水土保持和护林、护山工作，积极防止水灾发生。
