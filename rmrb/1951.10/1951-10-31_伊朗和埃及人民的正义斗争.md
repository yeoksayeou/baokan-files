    The just struggle of the Iranian and Egyptian people against Anglo-American imperialist colonial rule and for national independence and autonomy has vigorously developed. The national liberation movement in the Middle East has entered a new climax.
    Since March of this year, the Iranian people, in order to nationalize the oil industry, have launched a resolute struggle against the Anglo-American imperialist oppressors. Up to now, this struggle is still continuing and developing. Following Iran, the Egyptian government, under the continuous demands of the broad masses of the people, officially decided on the 8th of this month to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan of 1899, and this has been unanimously passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. Disregarding the government's martial law measures and the British army's frenzied suppression, the Egyptian people have held anti-British demonstrations in various places for days; Egyptian workers, staff, and transportation and customs personnel have taken action to resolutely resist the British occupiers. The people of Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and other countries have held mass demonstrations to express their enthusiastic support for the Egyptian people's momentous revolutionary actions. At the same time, the Iraqi people unanimously demanded the abolition of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, and the Iraqi government submitted a request to Britain on the 11th of this month to revise the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. All of these show that the struggle of the people of Middle Eastern countries against imperialist aggressors and for national independence and freedom is heading towards a general upsurge.
    Anglo-American imperialists have always regarded the Middle East as their rear for carrying out imperialist wars of plunder, and have always regarded the wealth of the Middle East countries and the blood and sweat of the Middle Eastern people as an important source for them to extract super-profits. Anglo-American imperialism, especially British imperialism, has carried out extremely cruel colonial rule in the Middle East countries for decades, causing the Middle East countries to be mired in poverty and suffering for a long time. In Iran, Britain forcibly occupied its rich oil fields and controlled its economic lifeline for as long as 50 years, and has been controlling Iran's internal affairs through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a blood-sucking machine. In Egypt, Britain has manipulated its politics, economy, and military, and enslaved this country and its people with a long culture for 70 years. Under British colonial rule, the Iranian and Egyptian people live a miserable and inhuman life, with disease, hunger, and unemployment spreading throughout the country, and the mortality rate reaching an alarming level. In Iran, there are currently more than one million unemployed. According to official Egyptian statistics, the death rate of the Egyptian people is 168 per 1,000 people, and the average life expectancy is only 27 years. Since the end of World War II, the aggressive claws of American aggressors have gradually extended into the Middle East, monopolizing the oil fields of Saudi Arabia, seizing the oil exploitation rights of Bahrain Island belonging to Iraq, and controlling 40% of the products of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. At the same time, Anglo-American imperialists have forcibly occupied military bases and built airports in Middle Eastern countries, attempting to turn the Middle East into a base and barracks for them to carry out anti-Soviet wars. The result of Anglo-American intensified war preparations in the Middle East has further deepened the disasters of the Middle Eastern people. This situation cannot but arouse great anger among the people of Iran, Egypt, and other countries in the Middle East. The people of the Middle East countries have deeply realized a truth from the humiliating and painful lives of the past few decades: if they cannot completely destroy the Anglo-American imperialist colonial rule in the Middle East and eliminate foreign aggressive forces, they cannot get rid of the miserable life of being enslaved and cannot get freedom and liberation. Therefore, the movement of the people of Iran, Egypt, and other countries in the Middle East against Anglo-American imperialism and for independence and autonomy has burned like a prairie fire, fiercely and rapidly.
    In order to maintain their aggressive interests in Iran and Egypt, Anglo-American imperialists have carried out barbaric interference in the just struggle of the Iranian and Egyptian people. After the Iranian Parliament passed the Oil Nationalization Act at the request of the Iranian people, the British government immediately increased its troops to Iran in an attempt to threaten the Iranian people into submission with armed intervention. Later, the British government attempted to interfere in Iran through the "International Court of Justice" and the United Nations Security Council. Just like its actions against Iran, after the Egyptian government announced the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan, the British government again attempted to suppress the just actions of the Egyptian people with military intervention. Britain is now constantly increasing its troops to Egypt and has occupied Egyptian cities and the bridges and customs of the Suez Canal. On the one hand, American imperialism actively supports these intervention actions of the British government, and on the other hand, it attempts to take the opportunity to expand American control over Iran and Egypt. The purpose of the U.S. government's active manipulation of negotiations between Britain and Iran is to obtain greater rights for U.S. monopoly capitalists to control Iranian oil. After the Egyptian government announced the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan, the U.S. government again attempted to replace British rule in Egypt and the entire Middle East with American rule. The suggestion of "establishing a Middle East Allied Command" put forward by the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey to the Egyptian government on October 13th extremely clearly exposed this ambition of American imperialism. The suggestion stated that if Egypt agreed to join the Middle East Allied Command and agreed to supply the command with strategic defense and other equipment on Egyptian territory, including military bases, air force bases, communication equipment, fortresses, etc., the British government could agree to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. At the same time, the British government, under the instruction of the United States, suggested to the Egyptian government to establish an international committee composed of the United States, Britain, and Egypt to "monitor the country's constitutional development." Obviously, the purpose of these two suggestions is to further make Egypt and Sudan colonies and occupied countries of the imperialist group headed by the United States. This sinister plan of American imperialism aroused the anger of the Egyptian people and the people of Middle Eastern countries. After the Egyptian government announced its refusal to participate in the "Middle East Allied Command," the U.S. government turned to openly oppose Egypt's cancellation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson even issued a statement on the 17th, shamelessly declaring that "the actions taken by the Egyptian government regarding the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the 1899 agreement on Sudan are inconsistent with the respect due to international obligations. The U.S. government believes that the actions of the Egyptian government are not effective." These shameless actions of the U.S. government on the Egyptian issue show that American imperialism is painstakingly attempting to realize its evil plan to enslave Egypt, Sudan, and the people of other countries in the Middle East.
    In order to cover up their aggressive faces and deceive the people of the world, Anglo-American imperialists are carrying out various arbitrary and absurd propaganda for their intervention actions. They are trying to make people believe that the Iranian people's recovery of their natural wealth from the aggressors and the Egyptian people's abolition of unequal treaties of foreign imperialist occupation of Egypt are "unilateral" actions that are "inconsistent with the respect due to international obligations"; they are trying to make people believe that they have "indubitable rights" to continue plundering Iranian oil—interfering in Iran's internal affairs, occupying Egyptian territory, and completely placing Egypt under their bloody rule. What are the "international obligations" spoken of by Anglo-American imperialists? Obviously, this is the "obligation" for the Iranian people and the Egyptian people to endure their enslavement and exploitation forever; similarly, the "rights" they speak of are the "rights" for them to wantonly slaughter Iran and Egypt forever. This is the logic in the dictionary of imperialist robbers. Anglo-American imperialists even want to slander the Iranian people's movement for independence and autonomy as "possibly endangering the maintenance of international peace and security." On the other hand, they describe their own military aggression against Egypt as being for "defending this important military and commercial artery," for "protecting the freedom that the free world can enjoy," for the "welfare and security of the Middle East," and for making the Middle East "free from aggression." Look at this ugly drama of a thief crying "stop thief!" Waging aggression is for "defending freedom" and "preventing aggression," while resisting aggression is "endangering international peace"... What is all this but the revival of Hitlerism! The US and British imperialists say it is to resist "Soviet aggression," but who is threatening the independence and survival of Iran and Egypt by forcibly occupying Iranian oil and using armed forces to occupy Egyptian territory, the Soviet Union, or the US and British imperialists? Isn't this clearer than sunlight? The Soviet Union not only has no intention of threatening or invading any other country, but has consistently sympathized with and supported the struggle of the people of oppressed countries against imperialism and for national independence. The Soviet Union's recent resolute condemnation in the Security Council of the actions of the British and American governments in using the Security Council to interfere in Iran's internal affairs is clear evidence that the Soviet Union respects and supports the desire of the people of oppressed countries to demand national independence. The people of Iran, Egypt, and other countries in the Middle East have realized from their own experiences that the Soviet Union is a reliable friend in their struggle for national liberation. Precisely because of this, they unanimously demand friendship with the Soviet Union while carrying out their struggle against Anglo-American imperialism. This shows that the slander of the Soviet Union by US and British imperialism has completely bankrupted in front of the people of the Middle Eastern countries.
    However, no matter how barbaric and shameless the intervention of US and British imperialism in Iran and Egypt is, they will never automatically give up their intervention actions. Therefore, in order to achieve their goals, the Iranian and Egyptian people must be prepared to wage a resolute and lasting struggle.
    The Iranian and Egyptian people are not isolated in their struggle. We, the Chinese people, have boundless sympathy for the just struggle of the Iranian and Egyptian people. The sympathy of the people of all Asia and the whole world is also on the side of the Iranian and Egyptian people.
    The current international situation is very favorable to the anti-imperialist struggle of the Iranian and Egyptian people. The strength of the camp of peace, democracy and socialism headed by the Soviet Union has become unprecedentedly strong. The struggle of the people of the whole world to defend world peace and strive for people's democracy is rising unprecedentedly, and the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are giving the American aggressors a serious blow in Korea. In short, the era in which imperialism ran rampant in the world has completely passed, and it is entirely possible for the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries to be liberated from imperialist oppression. Under this situation, as long as the Iranian and Egyptian people resolutely unite, unite with the people of other countries in the Middle East and the people of Asian countries, resolutely fight against the threats and conspiracies of the Anglo-American imperialist robbers, and prevent being deceived and betrayed midway, they will be able to achieve final victory.

### 伊朗和埃及人民的正义斗争

    伊朗和埃及人民的正义斗争
    伊朗和埃及人民反对英美帝国主义殖民统治、争取国家独立自主的斗争，已经蓬勃地发展起来。中东地区的民族解放运动已进入一个新的高潮。
    自今年三月以来，伊朗人民为了把石油工业收归国有，对英美帝国主义压迫者展开了坚决的斗争，直到目前为止，这一斗争还在继续坚持与发展中。继伊朗之后，埃及政府在广大人民的不断要求之下，已于本月八日正式决定废除一九三六年订立的英埃条约和一八九九年订立的英埃共管苏丹协定，并经参众两院先后一致通过。埃及人民不顾政府的戒严措施与英国军队的疯狂镇压，连日在各地举行了反英示威游行；埃及工人、职员以及交通和海关人员已采取行动，对英国占领者实行坚决的抵制。对于埃及人民这一轰轰烈烈的革命行动，伊朗、叙利亚、黎巴嫩等国人民均举行了群众示威，表示热情的声援。与此同时，伊拉克人民也一致要求废除一九三○年订立的英伊条约，伊拉克政府已于本月十一日向英国提出修改英伊条约的要求。这些都表明了中东各国人民反对帝国主义侵略者、争取国家独立自由的斗争，正在走向普遍的高涨。
    英美帝国主义者从来就把中东当作它们进行帝国主义掠夺战争的后方，从来就把中东各国的财富与中东人民的血汗当作它们榨取超额利润的重要来源的。英美帝国主义，尤其是英国帝国主义几十年来对中东各国实行了极其残酷的殖民统治，使中东各国长期陷入贫困和痛苦的深渊。在伊朗，英国强占了她的丰富油田、掌握了她的经济命脉已达五十年之久，并且通过英伊石油公司这个吸血机器，一直控制着伊朗的内政。在埃及，英国操纵着她的政治、经济和军事，奴役了这个文化悠久的国家和人民已经七十年了。伊朗人民和埃及人民在英国的殖民统治下，过着悲惨的非人生活，疾病、饥饿和失业遍及全国，死亡率达到惊人的程度。在伊朗，现有一百多万人失业。据埃及官方的统计，埃及人民的死亡率为每一千人中有一百六十八人，每人平均寿命仅二十七岁。第二次世界大战结束以来，美国侵略者的魔手也逐渐伸入中东，独占了沙特阿拉伯的油田，攫取了伊属巴林岛的石油开采权，并控制了英伊石油公司百分之四十的产品。同时，英美帝国主义并在中东各国强占军事基地，修筑飞机场，企图把中东变成它们进行反苏战争的基地和兵营。英美在中东加紧备战的结果，进一步加深了中东人民的灾难。这种情况，自然不能不激起伊朗人民、埃及人民和中东其他国家人民极大的愤怒。中东各国人民已经从过去几十年来屈辱和痛苦的生活中，深切地认识到一个真理：他们如果不能彻底摧毁英美帝国主义在中东的殖民统治，肃清外国的侵略势力，他们就不可能摆脱被奴役的悲惨生活，就不可能得到自由和解放。因此，伊朗、埃及以及中东地区其他国家的人民反对英美帝国主义、争取独立自主的运动，就如燎原之火，猛烈而迅速地燃烧起来了。
    英、美帝国主义者为了保持其在伊朗和埃及的侵略利益，对伊朗和埃及人民的正义斗争进行了野蛮的干涉。当伊朗国会在伊朗人民的要求下通过了石油国有化法案以后，英国政府立即向伊朗增兵，企图以武装干涉来威胁伊朗人民屈服。以后，英国政府又企图通过“国际法庭”和联合国安全理事会对伊朗实行干涉。和对伊朗的行动一样，在埃及政府宣布废除英埃条约和英埃共管苏丹的协定以后，英国政府又企图以武力干涉来镇压埃及人民的正义行动。英国现正不断向埃及增兵，并已占领了埃及的城市及苏彝士运河的桥梁和海关。美帝国主义一方面积极支持英国政府的这些干涉行动，另一方面又企图乘机扩张美国对伊朗和埃及的控制。美国政府之积极操纵英国和伊朗的谈判，其目的即在于为美国独占资本家取得控制伊朗石油的更大的权利。在埃及政府宣布废除英埃条约和英埃共管苏丹的协定以后，美国政府又企图以美国的统治来代替英国在埃及和整个中东地区的统治。美国于十月十三日和英、法、土一起向埃及政府提出的“设立中东联合司令部”的建议，极其清楚地暴露出美帝国主义的这一野心。该建议提出：如果埃及同意参加中东联合司令部，并同意将埃及领土上的战略防御及其他设备包括军事基地、空军基地、通讯设备、堡垒等供给该司令部使用，英国政府即可同意废除英埃条约。与此同时，英国政府并在美国指示下向埃及政府建议设立一由美、英、埃共同参加的国际委员会，以“监视该国的立宪发展”。很显然，这两个建议的目的，就是要使埃及和苏丹进一步成为以美国为首的帝国主义集团的殖民地和占领国。美帝国主义的这一阴险计划引起了埃及人民及中东各国人民的愤怒。在埃及政府宣布拒绝参加“中东联合司令部”以后，美国政府即转而公开反对埃及取消英埃条约及英埃共管苏丹的协定。美国务卿艾奇逊竟于十七日发表声明，无耻地宣称：“埃及政府对于一九三六年英埃条约和一八九九年关于苏丹的协定所采取的行动，与对国际义务应有的尊重是不相符合的。美国政府方面认为埃及政府的行动没有效力。”美国政府在埃及问题上的这些无耻行动，表明了美帝国主义正在处心积虑地企图实现其奴役埃及、苏丹以及中东其他各国人民的罪恶计划。
    英、美帝国主义者为了掩盖自己的侵略面貌，为了欺骗世界人民，正为他们的干涉行动进行各种武断的、荒谬的宣传。它们企图使人相信伊朗人民从侵略者手中收回自己的天然财富和埃及人民废除外国帝国主义占领埃及的不平等条约都是“片面”的行动，“与对国际义务的应有尊重是不相符合的”；它们企图使人相信它们有着“不可怀疑的权利”继续掠夺伊朗的石油——干涉伊朗的内政，侵占埃及的土地、把埃及完全置于它们血腥的统治之下。英美帝国主义者所说的“国际义务”是什么呢？显然的，这就是要伊朗人民和埃及人民永远忍受它们的奴役与剥削的“义务”；同样，它们所说的“权利”就是它们要永远为所欲为地任意宰割伊朗和埃及的“权利”。这就是帝国主义强盗字典中的逻辑。英美帝国主义者居然还要诬蔑伊朗人民争取独立自主的运动“可能有危及国际和平与安全的维持之势”，另一方面，他们又把他们自己对埃及的军事侵略行动形容为是为了“防卫这个重要的军事及商业动脉”，是为了“保护自由世界”“可以享受的自由”，是为了“中东的福利与安全”，是为了使中东“免遭侵略”。请看这种作贼喊贼的丑剧吧！肆行侵略，就是为了“保卫自由”和“防止侵略”，而抵抗侵略，就是“危及国际和平”……这一切不是希特勒主义的复活又是什么呢！美英帝国主义者说是为了抵抗“苏联的侵略”，但是强占伊朗的石油，用武装部队侵占埃及领土，因而威胁伊朗和埃及的独立与生存的，究竟是苏联呢，还是美英帝国主义者呢？这难道不比太阳光还要明白吗？苏联不但没有威胁和侵略任何别的国家的企图，而且一贯地同情和支持被压迫国家的人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争。苏联最近在安理会上坚决斥责英美两国政府利用安理会干涉伊朗内政的行为，就是苏联尊重和支持被压迫国家人民要求民族独立的愿望的明证。伊朗、埃及及中东其他各国人民已经从他们亲身的经验中，认识到苏联是他们在争取民族解放的斗争中的可靠的朋友。正是因为这样，他们才在进行反对英美帝国主义的斗争的同时，一致要求与苏联友好。这就说明，美英帝国主义对苏联的诬蔑已经在中东各国人民面前完全破产。
    但是，尽管美英帝国主义对伊朗和埃及的干涉是多么野蛮无耻，它们是绝不会自动放弃它们的这种干涉行动的。因此，伊朗人民和埃及人民为了实现自己的目标，就必须准备进行坚决的、持久的斗争。
    伊朗人民和埃及人民在斗争中不是孤立的。我们中国人民对伊朗和埃及人民的正义斗争寄予无限的同情。全亚洲和全世界人民的同情也是在伊朗和埃及人民这方面的。
    目前的国际形势对伊朗和埃及人民的反帝国主义斗争是非常有利的。以苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营的力量已空前强大起来。全世界人民保卫世界和平与争取人民民主的斗争正在空前地高涨，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军正在朝鲜给予美国侵略者以严重打击。总之，帝国主义在世界上横行霸道的时代已经完全过去了，殖民地半殖民地人民从帝国主义压迫下得到解放已经是完全可能的了。在这种形势下，伊朗和埃及人民只要坚决团结起来，并与中东其他各国人民和亚洲各国人民团结在一起，坚决地向英美帝国主义强盗的威胁和阴谋进行斗争，并防止中途被欺骗被出卖，就能够取得最后的胜利。
