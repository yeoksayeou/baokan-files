    Wuxi City Night Party School Conducted Communist Education
    The CPC [Communist Party of China] Sunan Wuxi Municipal Committee established a night party school to conduct education on Communism and the Communist Party for new party members and activists among the masses. The content of the education included: the history of the Chinese Communist Party, the nature of the Party, the Party's tasks at the current stage and its ultimate goal, the standards for party members, etc. From May 1950, the city's night party school has held four sessions. Eight hundred and five new party members, seven hundred and sixty-six members of the Communist Youth League, and six hundred and sixty-seven members of the masses, totaling 2,238 people, have received education, including 1,777 workers.
    Those who have received education from the night party school have a preliminary understanding of the history and nature of the Chinese Communist Party. Before studying, many comrades did not understand that the ultimate goal of the Communist Party is to realize Communism, and did not understand that the Party is the political party of the working class, mistakenly believing that the Communist Party is the party of the poor, the party of the peasants, or the party of the intellectuals. They were also unclear about why the Communist Party is glorious, correct, and great. After studying, worker students said: "Originally, the Communist Party is our own political party of the working class. From now on, I will cherish my own Party even more." Many people learned that the current task of the Chinese Communist Party is to implement New Democracy, and its ultimate goal is to achieve Communism, and they are willing to strive to achieve the Party's ultimate goal. Therefore, many people have requested to join the Party. After studying, everyone realized that studying the theory of party building is extremely important. The Lixin Factory study group generally believed in the discussion: "This study is like a compass, pointing out the direction for us. In the future, we must study the Party's program and propositions well."

    无锡市夜党校进行了共产主义教育
    中共苏南无锡市市委会举办夜党校，对新党员和群众中的积极分子进行了共产主义与共产党的教育。教育的内容为：中国共产党的历史，党的性质，党在现阶段的任务与最终目的，党员的标准等。从一九五○年五月起，该市夜党校已举办了四期。受过教育的新党员八百零五人，青年团员七百六十六人，群众六百六十七人，共计二千二百三十八人，其中工人有一千七百七十七人。
    受过夜党校教育的人，对中国共产党的历史和党的性质都有了初步的认识。在学习以前，有不少同志不懂得共产党的最终目的是实现共产主义，不懂得党是工人阶级的政党，错误地认为共产党是穷人的党、农民的党，或是知识分子的党。对共产党为什么是光荣的、正确的、伟大的，也闹不清楚。学习后，工人学员说：“原来共产党就是我们工人阶级自己的政党，今后我要更加爱护自己的党。”很多人知道了中国共产党在现阶段的任务是实行新民主主义，它的最终目的则是要实现共产主义，他们并愿为实现党的最终目的而奋斗。因此有很多人要求入党。大家在学习后都体会到对党的建设理论的学习极为重要。丽新厂学习小组在讨论中，普遍认为：“这次学习像指南针一样，给我们指出了方向，今后要好好学习党的纲领和主张。”
