    Salt Police in Huaibei Repeatedly Assault People; Relevant Departments Should Strictly Handle This
    To the Editor:
    Some soldiers and cadres of the Independent First Battalion of the Huaibei Salt Police frequently assault people. The Liberation Daily and the Salt Field Public Newspaper criticized this in April, and the Salt Field Battalion headquarters also made a public self-criticism, but incidents of assault continue to occur repeatedly. For example, in May of this year, Zhang Mao'an, a soldier recuperating in the Huaibei Salt Field Hospital, beat the caregiver squad leader Gao Quan with a small bamboo pole over trivial matters. In June, Platoon Leader Yao Bangzhi (a Party member) beat Wang Bufa, a correspondent for the hospital. On September 18, soldier Zhang Honggui (a Party member) used his fists and a wooden board to beat Li Dongsheng, a clerk at the hospital, and soldiers Zhang Xuejun and Chen Zhiyou, who lived with him, joined in the beating, swelling Li Dongsheng's right arm.
    These assaults occurred after newspaper criticism, demonstrating that the self-criticism made by the Salt Field Battalion headquarters was all "empty talk on paper." I suggest that the East China Salt Affairs Administration instruct relevant departments to conduct a thorough investigation into these assaults and handle them strictly.

    Editor's Note: The repeated assaults by some salt police in Huaibei are primarily the responsibility of the Salt Field Battalion headquarters and its superior organs. Please East China Salt Affairs Administration conscientiously investigate and promptly handle this matter.

### 淮北有些盐警屡次打人  有关部门应该严格处理

    淮北有些盐警屡次打人
    有关部门应该严格处理编辑同志：
    淮北盐警独立第一大队部分战士和干部时常打人。四月间解放日报及盐场大众报曾予以批评，盐场大队部也公开作了检讨，但打人事件仍屡出不穷。如今年五月间，在淮北盐场卫生院休养的战士张貌安，因生活小事，又用小竹杆打了照护班长高全；六月，排长姚邦志（党员），打了卫生院通讯员王步法；九月十八日，战士张洪贵（党员）用拳用木板打了卫生院事务员李东生，同住的战士张学俊、陈志友，也跟上去打，打肿了李东生的右膀。
    这些打人现象发生在报纸批评以后，足见盐场大队部所作的检讨都是“纸上空谈”。我建议华东区盐务管理局责成有关部门对此打人事件作深入检查并严格处理。淮北盐场  长  江
    编者按：淮北有些盐警屡次打人，主要应由盐场大队队部及其上级机关负责。请华东区盐务管理机关认真检查从速处理。
