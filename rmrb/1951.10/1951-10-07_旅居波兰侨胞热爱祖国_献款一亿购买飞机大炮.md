    Overseas Chinese in Poland Love the Motherland
    Donate 100 Million to Purchase Airplanes and Cannons

Editor:

The hundred-plus overseas Chinese residing in Poland, although having been away from the motherland for more than fifteen years, always cherish the motherland. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the leaping progress in all aspects have given the overseas Chinese great encouragement. This nationwide movement of donating airplanes and cannons, which is in full swing, has further aroused the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese. All overseas Chinese in Warsaw took the lead in responding to the call of the motherland and enthusiastically donated. Overseas Chinese in Łódź and Lublin also responded successively, donating a total of 17,430 Polish zlotys, equivalent to approximately 100 million RMB. Although the amount of money donated is small, it can express the overseas Chinese's little bit of heartfelt wishes for the motherland. This donation has now been remitted to the Head Office of the People's Bank of China.

    旅居波兰侨胞热爱祖国
    献款一亿购买飞机大炮编辑同志：
    旅居波兰的百余侨胞，虽然都已远离祖国十五年以上，却始终怀念着祖国。祖国人民革命的伟大胜利和各方面的飞跃进步给了侨胞很大的鼓舞。这次全国如火如荼的捐献飞机大炮运动更激起了侨胞们的爱国热情。华沙全体侨胞首先响应祖国号召踊跃捐献，罗兹、卢布林两地的侨胞亦相继响应，共计捐献一万七千四百三十波元，约合人民币一亿元。虽然捐的钱很少，但能表示侨胞对祖国的一点心意。此项捐款现已汇中国人民银行总行。
