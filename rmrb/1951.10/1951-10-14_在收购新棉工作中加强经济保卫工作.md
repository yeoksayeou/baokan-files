    Strengthening Economic Defense Work in New Cotton Procurement

    Various regions have successively discovered acts of sabotage in the work of procuring new cotton. These acts of sabotage powerfully illustrate the importance of strengthening economic defense work.

    These acts of sabotage are caused by two different reasons. One is due to planned sabotage by special agents. For example, the Huangkou Processing Factory of the Huasha Bu Company in the Wanbei District discovered nine phosphorus match heads and a brick (the match could be ignited by rubbing it with the brick) in the raw cotton it purchased. Fortunately, it was handled properly and no disaster occurred. The other is due to the carelessness of cadres and the masses. For example, when the grassroots cooperative of Duangan Village, Luancheng County, Hebei, purchased cotton, it used matches instead of small change to pay the cotton farmers. On September 18, a cotton farmer ignited the stored cotton while smoking; although emergency rescue prevented a major disaster, 230 catties of seed cotton were burned.

    All regions must be sufficiently vigilant against counter-revolutionary sabotage. Don't think that because the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has achieved great results, you can become complacent in your thinking, thinking that the world is at peace and you can "rest easy." This is extremely dangerous. It is true that since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the counter-revolutionary elements have suffered a fatal blow, but the remaining few counter-revolutionary elements are still waiting for opportunities to sabotage us; they may cause great harm to the people's cause. We must maintain vigilance at all times and continue to wage a resolute struggle against these remaining counter-revolutionary forces to protect the interests of the country and the people. Of course, carelessness must also be opposed.

### 在收购新棉工作中加强经济保卫工作

    在收购新棉工作中加强经济保卫工作
    各地在收购新棉工作中，陆续发现了一些破坏事件。这些破坏事件，有力地说明了加强经济保卫工作的重要性。
    这些破坏事件，是由两种不同的原因造成的。一种是由于特务分子有计划地破坏。例如：花纱布公司皖北区公司萧县黄口加工厂在收购的原棉中，发现磷头火柴九根及砖头一块（火柴与砖头摩擦即可发火），幸处置得宜，没有成灾。一种是由于干部、群众疏忽大意。例如：河北栾城县断干村基层合作社收棉时，以火柴代替零票，付给棉农。九月十八日，一棉农吸烟时引燃存棉；虽经急救未成巨灾，但已烧毁籽棉二百三十余斤。
    对于反革命的破坏行为，各地必须引起足够的警惕。不要以为镇压反革命运动已有了伟大成绩，就在思想上麻痹起来，认为天下已经太平，可以“安心”了。这是极端危险的。不错，在镇压反革命运动以来，反革命分子已经遭受了致命的打击，但残存的少数的反革命分子，仍在伺机破坏我们；它们可能给予人民事业极大的危害。必须随地保持警惕，继续和这些反革命残余势力作坚决的斗争，以保卫国家人民的利益。当然，疏忽大意，也是应当反对的。
