    I. Before entrusting the handling of dangerous goods (including flammable, explosive, toxic, irritant, and other items), the cargo owner must notify the handling company in writing of the name, quantity, nature, packaging, and other information of the goods.
    II. The cargo owner shall properly package the dangerous goods to be transported according to their nature, and mark the packaging of the goods with obvious signs such as "Dangerous Goods," "Poisonous Goods," and their names. If the packaging is damaged and may cause poisoning or other dangers, workers may refuse to handle it at any time.
    III. The handling company must have sufficient and effective protective equipment and first-aid equipment.
    IV. The daily working hours for workers handling toxic goods shall be six to eight hours; the continuous working time shall not exceed two hours, and there shall be appropriate rest time in between.
    V. The wages for handling dangerous goods shall be calculated at 115% to 150% of the wages for handling ordinary goods.
    VI. Before the handling work begins, the cargo owner and the handling company must explain in detail to the workers the dangers of the goods being handled and the protection methods, and be responsible for answering all matters that the workers raise regarding precautions during handling.
    VII. The handling company and the handling union shall, together with the cargo owners who frequently use manual labor to handle dangerous goods, formulate rules for handling dangerous goods, which shall include the following:
    	1. Responsibilities of the personnel dispatched by the cargo owner to guide the handling work.
    	2. Special precautions and requirements for workers when handling dangerous goods (such as no smoking, care for equipment, compliance with handling operating rules, etc.).
    	3. Specific regulations for taking emergency measures and emergency reporting system in case of accidents during work.
    The foregoing rules shall be submitted to the local labor administrative organ for review and record.
    VIII. When the handling company allocates workers, it shall give appropriate consideration to the workers' skills, experience, and physical strength.
    IX. The handling company shall establish a system for conducting safety education for workers to improve workers' knowledge of handling dangerous goods.
    X. If an accident occurs due to the cargo owner or the handling company violating these measures, appropriate penalties shall be imposed depending on the severity of the circumstances.
    XI. When a worker's health or life is endangered during the handling of dangerous goods, the worker shall enjoy the following benefits:
    	1. When a worker is poisoned or injured, the cargo owner shall bear all medical expenses, and wages shall be paid as usual.
    	2. If a worker becomes disabled due to the handling of dangerous goods, the cargo owner shall pay the worker three to nine months' wages as disability compensation, depending on the circumstances.
    	3. If a worker dies due to the handling of dangerous goods, in addition to the cargo owner paying the deceased's family funeral expenses equal to two months' wages, they must also pay the deceased's dependent direct relatives a one-time compensation equal to nine months of the deceased's wages.
    The above method of calculating wages: The daily wage is obtained by multiplying the daily prescribed working hours, the number of pieces handled per hour, and the piece rate. Each month is calculated as 25.5 working days.
    XII. Local labor bureaus shall, in accordance with these measures, work with the handling union, the handling company, and other relevant agencies to formulate specific measures suitable to local conditions and submit them to the local people's government for review and approval before implementation.
    Note: The term "cargo owner" in these measures refers to factories, enterprises, institutions, organizations, vendors, or their agents who have ownership of the goods being handled. (Xinhua News Agency)
