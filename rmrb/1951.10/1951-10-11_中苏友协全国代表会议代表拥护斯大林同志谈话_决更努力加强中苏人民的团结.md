Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: The delegates to the First National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held group discussions on the 10th to discuss Marshal Stalin's speech on the issue of atomic weapons. The delegates unanimously agreed in their speeches that Marshal Stalin's speech on atomic weapons was good news for peace-loving people all over the world. This speech greatly inspired and strengthened the will and confidence of the people of the world to defend world peace; at the same time, it was also a serious warning to the war-mongering elements of the United States. This speech once again proved to the people of the world that the great Soviet Union is an indestructible fortress of world peace. Liu Zhaoyun, a representative from Hubei Province, said: "Marshal Stalin's speech on the issue of atomic weapons gave a serious blow to the gangster behavior of US imperialism in threatening peace with atomic bombs." Ma Xuehai (Hui nationality), a representative from Gansu Province, said: US imperialism is like a mad dog. It won't listen if you tell it not to bite; it's only afraid when you pick up weapons to deal with it. Nusreti (Uyghur nationality), a representative from Xinjiang Province, said: Before and after the liberation of Xinjiang, the American spy Osman spread rumors that the Soviet Union opposed the use of atomic bombs because she did not have atomic bombs. This speech by Marshal Stalin powerfully refuted the shameless rumors of the American spies. The representatives from various regions also unanimously expressed in the discussions that they would work harder in the future to do a good job in the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union, in order to defend world peace.

    中苏友协全国代表会议代表拥护斯大林同志谈话
    决更努力加强中苏人民的团结
     【新华社十日讯】中苏友好协会第一次全国代表会议全体代表十日分组举行座谈，讨论斯大林大元帅关于原子武器问题的谈话。各地代表的发言，一致认为斯大林大元帅关于原子武器的谈话，是全世界爱好和平人民的福音。这个谈话，大大鼓舞和加强了全世界人民保卫世界和平的斗争意志和胜利信心；同时也是对美国的战争贩子的一个严重警告。这次谈话又一次在全世界人民面前证明伟大的苏联是世界和平的不可摧毁的堡垒。湖北省代表刘照云说：“斯大林大元帅关于原子武器问题的谈话，给了美帝国主义用原子弹威胁和平的流氓行为一个严重的打击。”甘肃省代表马学海（回族）说：美帝国主义像一条疯狗。你叫它不要咬人，它是不理会的；只有拿起对付它的武器来，它就害怕了。新疆省代表努斯热提（维吾尔族）说：新疆解放前后，美国间谍乌斯满造谣说，苏联反对用原子弹，是因为她没有原子弹。这次斯大林大元帅的谈话，有力地驳斥了美国间谍的无耻造谣。各地代表在座谈中并一致表示今后要更加努力，作好中苏友好协会的工作，加强中苏两国人民的友谊和团结，以保卫世界和平。
