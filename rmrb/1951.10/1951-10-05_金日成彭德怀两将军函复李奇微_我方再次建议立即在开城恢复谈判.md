Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th – General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, replied on October 3rd to Ridgway's reply letter of September 27th. The full text is as follows:

To General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces:

We have received your reply letter of September 27th.

In this letter, you have once again raised the demand for changing the location of the meeting, which you raised on September 6th and which we refuted in our letter of September 11th. We believe there is no reason for this. Kaesong as the meeting location was agreed upon by your side, and the neutralization of the Kaesong area was proposed by your side on July 13th and determined through consultation between the two sides. Since then, except for the accidental incident on August 4th, which was swiftly and effectively handled by our side to your satisfaction, your side has not raised any objections to the neutral status of the Kaesong neutral zone. The interruption of the armistice talks from August 22nd onwards was solely caused by your own destruction of the Kaesong neutral zone, making the meeting impossible. Therefore, after your side acknowledged the incident of the United Nations forces destroying the Kaesong neutral zone on September 10th and expressed willingness to take responsibility for handling it, our side immediately proposed resuming the meeting. The current issue is to immediately resume the Kaesong armistice talks and, at the meeting, stipulate strict agreements on the neutralization of the Kaesong area to ensure that such violations of the agreement do not occur again. We should absolutely not create extraneous issues and raise new questions about changing the meeting location.

Anyone can easily see that if your side can arbitrarily destroy the neutralization of the Kaesong area, which you yourselves proposed, then what guarantee is there that if the meeting location is changed according to your request, you will not carry out destruction again when you need to interrupt or break off the talks, and will the meeting environment not be even more dangerous? Therefore, your side's raising of this unreasonable demand, if not to create a threat, is only to create a new excuse to continue delaying the negotiations. Our sincere and responsible attitude towards the negotiations is well known to the world, but whether the negotiations can be immediately resumed and successfully achieve results is not unilaterally decided by our side. It is clear that as long as your side has the same sincere and responsible attitude towards the negotiations as our side and no longer creates extraneous issues along the way, the negotiations should not be difficult to achieve a reasonable result that the people of the participating countries urgently expect.

Therefore, we once again suggest to you: the delegations of both sides should immediately reconvene in Kaesong, and at the first meeting after the resumption, establish an appropriate mechanism to stipulate strict agreements on the neutralization of the Kaesong area and ensure its implementation, in order to facilitate the progress of the armistice negotiations.

After your side agrees, our liaison officer will discuss with your liaison officer the matters concerning the resumption of the meeting of the two sides' delegations in Kaesong.

Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers
October 3, 1951

The following is Ridgway's reply letter of September 27th:

"General Kim Il-sung
General Peng Dehuai:

Since your liaison officers have stated that they are not authorized to discuss or arrange satisfactory conditions for resuming armistice negotiations, I am making the following recommendations directly to you. I believe this recommendation will provide an arrangement satisfactory to both parties.

I suggest that the delegations of both sides meet as soon as possible in an area between the two sides' battle lines in the outskirts of Songhyon-ni, approximately equidistant from both sides. Of course, both sides will agree that the meeting location will be free of armed forces, and that both sides will refrain from taking any hostile actions or exercising authority against members of the other side's delegation while en route to or at that location.

I suggest that when the delegations' meeting resumes at that location, both delegations, after any necessary discussions to clarify the physical and security arrangements of the meeting location, should be prepared to immediately return to the discussion of item two of the agenda.

If you agree, I will make arrangements for the liaison officers of both sides to meet to discuss the immediate establishment of the necessary physical facilities.

General of the Army, United States Army
Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, Matthew B. Ridgway"

### 金日成彭德怀两将军函复李奇微  我方再次建议立即在开城恢复谈判

    金日成彭德怀两将军函复李奇微
    我方再次建议立即在开城恢复谈判
    美方横生枝节提出更换会址的无理要求，是为了造成继续拖延谈判的新的藉口。
    【新华社平壤四日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，于十月三日致函答复李奇微九月二十七日的复信，全文如下：联合国军李奇微总司令：
    你九月二十七日的复信收到了。
    你在这次来信中，又将你在九月六日提过而已为我们在九月十一日去信中批驳了的关于更换会议地址的要求重新提出，我们认为实无任何理由。开城之为会议地址是你方所同意了的，开城区中立化又是你方于七月十三日提议而经双方协商确定了的。从那时以来，除八月四日曾发生偶然事件并经我方迅速切实处理你方已认为满意以外，你方对于开城中立区的中立状况并未提出过任何指摘。从八月二十二日起停战会议的中断，仅仅是由于你方自己破坏开城中立区使会议无法进行而引起的，因此，在你方承认了九月十日联合国军破坏开城中立区的事件并表示愿意予以负责处理以后，我方就立即提议复会。目前的问题就是立即恢复开城停战谈判，并在会议上规定开城区中立化的严格的协议，以保证将来不再发生这类违反协议的事件，而绝不应该节外生枝，又来提出更换会议地址的新问题。
    任何人都容易看出：你方对于你方自己提议的开城区的中立化，尚且可以肆意破坏，则按照你方要求更换会议地址，又有何保证在你方需要中断谈判或破裂谈判时，你方不再进行破坏，会议环境不将是更加险恶呢？因此，你方提出这种无理要求，如果不是为了造成威胁，就只是为了造成继续拖延谈判的新的藉口。我们对于谈判的诚恳负责态度是世所周知的，但是谈判能否立即恢复并顺利获致结果，并不由我方片面决定。很明显，只要你方对于谈判具有和我方一样的诚恳负责态度，而不再在中途横生枝节，谈判本来应当不难获致为参战各国人民所迫切期望的合理的结果。
    因此，我们再一次向你建议：双方代表团应立即在开城复会，并在复会后的第一次会议上成立一个适当的机构去规定开城区中立化的严格的协议，并保证其执行，以利停战谈判的进行。
    在你方同意后，我方联络官即将与你方联络官洽商双方代表团在开城复会的事宜。朝鲜人民军最高司令官  金日成中国人民志愿军司令员
  彭德怀
                    一九五一年十月三日按李奇微九月二十七日的复信如下：“金日成将军  彭德怀将军：
    由于你方的联络官员曾声明他们未经授权来讨论或安排满意的条件以恢复停战谈判，我直接向你们提出下列建议。我相信这一建议将提供可使双方满意的安排。
    我建议双方代表团尽早于松贤里郊外双方战线之间与双方距离约略相等的地点会晤。当然，双方将同意会议地点将无武装部队，同时，双方对于另一方代表团团员在前往该一地点的途中或在该一地点时，避免采取任何敌对行动或行施权力。
    我建议代表团的会议在该地点恢复时，双方代表团在对澄清会议地点的物质和安全布置作任何可能是必需的讨论之后，应准备立即回到议程第二项的讨论中去。
    如果你们赞同，我将作部署使双方的联络官会晤，以讨论立即建立必要的物质设备。
    美国陆军上将
  联合国军总司令李奇微”
