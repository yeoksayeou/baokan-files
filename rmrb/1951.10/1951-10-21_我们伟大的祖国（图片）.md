Our Great Motherland
Beets, one of the raw materials for sugar production, are produced in Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China. In the past, due to the extremely unreasonable prices offered by the Kuomintang reactionary government for the raw materials and the unsoundness of agricultural experiment work, its yield and variety had been deteriorating. Now the situation is completely different. This year, the beets in Northeast China have had a bumper harvest. This is an old farmer from Songjiang Province holding the beets he personally cultivated.
