    Our Entire Army Joins the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as Members, Uniting with the Soviet People to Defend Peace
    To the Editor:
    The news that the entire Chinese People's Liberation Army, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, has joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as a group member makes me very happy, because from now on, I am a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    I deeply know that China's revolution could not have been victorious without the assistance of the Soviet Union; even with victory, it is impossible to build a socialist country without them. Now the Soviet Union is the strong fortress of world peace, and we resolutely lean to the side of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always stood at the forefront of defending peace. Now that our entire army has joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as a group member, we are even more united and closely linked with the powerful and invincible Soviet people to defend world peace. I resolutely respond to the call of the General Political Department of the Military Commission to vigorously promote Sino-Soviet friendship and introduce the Soviet Union, strengthen the troops' understanding of the Soviet Union and deep friendship, smash any provocative acts of American imperialism, and fight to the end to defend world peace.

    我们全军加入中苏友协为会员与苏联人民团结起来保卫和平编辑同志：
    中国人民解放军陆空海军全军加入中苏友好协会为团体会员的消息。使我感到非常的高兴。因为我从今以后是中苏友好协会的会员了。
    我深深地知道：中国的革命，没有苏联的援助是不可能胜利的；胜利了，要建设一个社会主义国家也是不可能的。现在苏联是世界和平的强大堡垒，我们坚决倒向以苏联为首的和平民主阵营一边。中国人民解放军一向是站在保卫和平的最前哨，现在我们全军已加入了中苏友好协会为团体会员，与强大无敌的苏联人民更加团结紧密一起保卫世界和平。我坚决响应军委总政治部的号召，要大力进行宣传中苏友好和介绍苏联的工作，加强部队对苏联的认识与深厚友谊，粉碎美帝国主义的任何挑衅行为，为保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。中国人民解放军空军某部理论教员训练班学员  龙世祉
