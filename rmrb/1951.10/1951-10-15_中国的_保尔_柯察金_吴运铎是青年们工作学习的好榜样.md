    China's "Pavel Korchagin" Wu Yunduo is a Good Example for Young People's Work and Study
    To the Editor:
    The article "How Steel Was Tempered," published in the People's Daily on October 5th, deeply moved and educated me.
    China's Pavel Korchagin, Comrade Wu Yunduo, is a meritorious worker in the ordnance industry of the People's Liberation Army. In ordnance production, he was seriously injured twice. Four fingers of his left hand were blown off by gunpowder, his wrist was blown off, his knee was damaged, and his right foot was blown off. He became disabled but still insisted on bravely fighting for the revolutionary cause. These heroic deeds moved me to tears! Why was Comrade Wu Yunduo so brave? I believe Comrade Wu would answer like this: "Because I am a Communist Party member!" He is not afraid of physical disability, not afraid of any difficulties, and he will always serve the Party and the people with infinite loyalty.
    Now, I clearly realize that I should hold my chest up and exert my tenacious fighting power in study and work. Whatever the people need me to do, I will do it wholeheartedly without considering personal interests. Such a life is beautiful and meaningful.
    In study and work, Comrade Wu Yunduo is my best example, and the best example for our millions of young people.
                                                Bai Feng

### 中国的“保尔·柯察金”吴运铎是青年们工作学习的好榜样

    中国的“保尔·柯察金”吴运铎是青年们工作学习的好榜样编辑同志：
    人民日报十月五日所刊载的“钢铁是这样炼成的”一文，深深地感动了我，并教育了我。
    中国的保尔·柯察金吴运铎同志，是人民解放军中的兵工功臣。在兵工生产中，他曾两次负了重伤。他的左手的四个指头被火药炸掉了，手腕炸掉了，膝盖炸坏了，右脚炸掉了；他变成了残废，但仍坚持地为革命事业英勇奋斗。这样的英雄事迹，使我感动得掉下泪来！为什么吴运铎同志会这样勇敢呢？我相信吴同志一定这样回答：“因为我是一个共产党员！”他不怕身体残废，不怕任何困难，他永远无限忠诚地为党、为人民服务。
    现在，我明确地认识到：应该把自己的胸膛挺起来，在学习和工作中发挥出自己顽强的战斗力量。凡是人民需要我去做的事，毫不考虑个人利益，全心全意地去干。这样的生命才是美丽的、有意义的。
    在学习和工作中，吴运铎同志正是我的最好的榜样，正是我们千万年青人最好的榜样。
                                                白峰
