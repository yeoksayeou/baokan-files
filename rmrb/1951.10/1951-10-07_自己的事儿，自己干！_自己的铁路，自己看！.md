    Our own affairs, we'll do them ourselves!
    Our own railway, we'll watch it ourselves!
    To the Editor:
    Dawangtun Village in Qi County, Pingyuan Province, is a model village for protecting the railway. The village's railway protection team was established in August 1949, after the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway line was opened to traffic. The village's railway protection team truly regards the railway as its own and protects it wholeheartedly. One night in November 1949, Xia Zhengfa, the leader of the railway protection team, and his team members caught a special agent who was sabotaging a railway bridge during a patrol. Based on the clues provided by the special agent, they arrested his accomplices. The Zhengzhou Railway Administration therefore presented the Dawangtun Railway Protection Team with a red banner that read "Model for Cherishing the People's Railway." Since then, all the people of the village have participated in railway protection work. When fourteen-year-old child, Wen Zhang, was working in the fields, he saw thick smoke suddenly rising from the railway. He thought: if the sleepers are burned, the train won't be able to run! He hurriedly found Xia Zhengfa's home and then his teacher. The three of them ran to the source of the smoke and saw a group of children playing with fire, so they dissuaded them. I asked the people of Dawangtun: "Why are you so concerned about the railway?" The villagers said: "In the past, the railway belonged to Chiang Kai-shek, who used it to transport troops and bullets to kill the people, and also to transport our grain away; at that time, we hated the sound of the train. Now the railway is our own; the soybean cake we used this year was transported by train from outside the pass; why shouldn't we protect the railway?" Now, a folk song is popular in the village: Our own affairs, we'll do them ourselves! Our own railway, we'll watch it ourselves!

    自己的事儿，自己干！
    自己的铁路，自己看！编辑同志：
    平原省淇县大王屯是一个保护铁路的模范村。该村护路队自一九四九年八月京汉线全部通车后就成立了。该村护路队真正把铁路看成自己的东西，尽心竭意地保护它。一九四九年十一月的一个晚上，护路队队长夏正法和队员们在巡逻时，捉住一个破坏铁路桥梁的特务，并根据这个特务供出的线索，逮捕了他的同党。郑州铁路管理局因此赠给大王屯护路队一面“爱护人民铁路的模范”的红色锦旗。此后，该村人民全体参加了护路工作。十四岁的儿童文章正在地里作活时，看见铁路上突然冒起浓烟，他想：烧坏枕木，火车就不能开了！他急急忙忙地找到夏正法家，又找到他的老师，三人跑到冒烟处，看见是一群小孩在玩火，就把小孩劝开了。我问大王屯的人：“你们为什么这样关心铁路呢？”村里的农民们说：“过去铁路是蒋介石的，他运兵运子弹杀害老百姓，还把咱们的粮食运走；那时听见火车响就恨得慌。现在铁路是自己的了；今年咱们用的豆饼，就是由火车从关外运来的；我们为什么不来护路？”现在，村里流行着一首歌谣：自己的事儿，自己干！自己的铁路，自己看！
