To the Editor:

    Zhou Longquan, a worker in the compounding room of the Shanghai Great China Rubber Factory, has successfully created a substitute for lampblack. Lampblack is the main raw material for making tire liners (materials used in the process of baking automobile tires). Zhou Longquan has been working in the factory for twenty years. Before liberation, his purpose in working was to earn wages to "support his family." He never thought about other aspects. After liberation, he deeply realized the glory of the working class in becoming masters of the country, and his view and attitude towards work completely changed. After Shanghai was bombed last February, he hated American imperialism deeply. He knew that industrial raw materials must be found domestically, and lampblack was precisely a foreign product. Therefore, he began to painstakingly research and create a substitute for lampblack. Under the active encouragement of the trade union leaders, after more than a year of continuous experimentation, he finally succeeded in August this year. This innovation greatly reduced the cost of raw materials. In the past, one batch of ingredients required 15.5 pounds of lampblack, almost enough to make one appropriately sized tire liner. Now, after using the lampblack substitute, each batch only needs 5 pounds of lampblack, saving 10.5 pounds. Calculating that the factory makes more than 100 batches per month, it can save more than 1,000 pounds of lampblack per month, worth about 400 million yuan. Moreover, tire liners made with the lampblack substitute are softer, more heat-resistant, and more durable, greatly shortening production time.

    上海大中华橡胶厂工人周龙泉创制墨灰代用品成功编辑同志：
    上海大中华橡胶厂配药间工人周龙泉，创造墨灰代用品成功。墨灰是制成衬胎（烘制汽车胎过程中所用物）的主要原料。周龙泉在该厂做工已有二十年了，他在解放前工作的目的是赚工钱“养家活口”，从没有想到其他方面。解放后，他深深体会到工人阶级翻身做主人的光荣，对工作的看法与态度完全不同了。在去年二月上海被轰炸后，他恨透了美帝国主义。他知道工业原料必须设法自给，而墨灰却正是外国货。于是，他就开始苦心钻研创制墨灰的代用品。在工会领导干部的积极鼓励下，经过了一年多的不断试验，于今年八月终于成功。这一创造，大大地减少了原料费用的支出。过去，一车配料需用墨灰十五磅半，做一车差不多刚好制一只尺寸适中的衬胎。现在用了墨灰代用品后，每车只需用墨灰五磅，可以节省十磅半。以该厂每月做一百多车计算，一个月可节省墨灰一千多磅，约值四亿元左右。而且，以墨灰代用品制成的衬胎，因品质柔软和耐热经用，使生产时间缩短很多。
