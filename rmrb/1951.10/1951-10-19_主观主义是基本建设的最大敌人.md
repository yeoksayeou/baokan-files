Subjectivism is the Greatest Enemy of Basic Construction
He Shui, Director of Datong Mining Bureau

    The working principle of Datong Mining Bureau in 1950 was "Recovery as the main task, production as the auxiliary task." In 1950, many problems occurred in the basic construction projects during the recovery work. When carrying out basic construction work, we did not grasp the procedures of basic construction. Without detailed investigation and research, and serious discussion and comparison, we only made plans based on subjective wishes and enthusiasm, and wanted to start construction as soon as we had plans. Such plans were often rough and lacked long-term considerations and unified technical leadership, so that changes were very large after construction started, and rework and reconstruction occurred frequently, causing undue losses to national wealth. The manifestations of this subjective work style are as follows:

    First, blindly carrying out recovery based on the old foundation. The Datong Mining Bureau carried out its work in 1950 under the principle of "Recovery as the main task, production as the auxiliary task." The mines under the Bureau suffered severe damage from the enemy before liberation. All the power generation equipment with more than 18,000 horsepower was destroyed, the machines were incomplete, thirteen pits were flooded, and 150,000 square meters of factory buildings were in ruins. As the saying goes, "A broken family is worth a fortune," we always believed that if we could restore it to its original state as soon as possible, we could produce a large amount and accumulate wealth for the country. Under the guidance of this idea, we often did not conduct careful investigation and research, and blindly used the old foundation to carry out recovery work. For example, the recovery of the hoist room of No. 9 well in the Third Mine used the old hoist seat and damaged hoist for design. The recovery work cost a total of 57,000 jin of millet. However, the engine room was not completed for a year before the old hoist seat cracked. After research, it was found that the hoist seat had been burned twice and exploded once. Although the appearance was still intact, the strength could not support it, so the engine room had to be rebuilt. At that time, it was originally thought that repairing it in the same way could save money, but it resulted in waste. Under the guidance of this idea of blindly using the old foundation, many buildings did not make long-term plans based on the actual situation, resulting in the same result as the hoist room.

    Second, rashly carrying out recovery work without considering subjective and objective conditions. This is particularly evident in the work of restoring the gunpowder factory. The restoration project plan for 1950 did not include the restoration of the gunpowder factory. In March and April, the responsible comrades of the Coal Mine Management Bureau, together with the responsible comrades of the Bureau, visited the old site of the gunpowder factory. Everyone felt that the coal mine consumed a lot of gunpowder, which accounted for a large proportion of the cost. If we restore the gunpowder factory, we can guarantee production on the one hand, and reduce costs on the other hand. In this way, the decision to restore the gunpowder factory was made rashly. We did not conduct detailed research on whether we have the conditions to restore it, to what extent it should be restored, and how much it should produce annually, and we blindly started construction. As a result, after the house was built, we still didn't know where the machines were, and where to transfer the technicians from. We had to start manual production first. Manual production was very inefficient and the security conditions were very poor, so we decided to add machinery and equipment again. The addition of equipment would have to be ordered from Northeast China in 1951, so the entire factory was in a state of half production and half shutdown for a year. The progress of this project was completely blind, and only based on the whim of a few responsible cadres, a subjective decision was made. This kind of subjective decision can only make things worse, not better.

    Third, the idea of ​​underestimating design. In order to complete the recovery plan as soon as possible, no detailed design was carried out for each project in 1950. Most of the projects only had rough plans before construction started. Designing and construction were carried out at the same time during the project. Due to the underestimation of design work, no responsible overall design organization was established. Civil engineering, mechanical and electrical, and coal mining designs were carried out separately and were not related to each other. Some administrative management cadres even believed that "design is too troublesome and delays construction time"; they thought that "the common people didn't draw drawings, but they still built houses"; they thought that "the valuation after the technicians' design is higher than the workers' valuation," so the wrong idea of ​​"it's better not to design" was produced. Under the guidance of this wrong idea, some projects started construction without design. For example: several administrative cadres saw that No. 6 well's east main roadway produced 500 tons of coal per day, and 120 cart pushers were used, and derailments and injuries occurred frequently, so they planned to improve the transportation equipment and install endless ropes to ensure safety, save manpower, and improve efficiency. When technical personnel were convened for research, the technical personnel advocated that a decision should be made after measurement and design. The administrative cadres were anxious to achieve results at that time and did not adopt the opinions of the technical personnel, and decided to start construction while designing. Because there was no measurement and design beforehand, after the endless rope was installed, it was felt that there were too many twists and turns in the roadway and the roadbed was not good and could not be used. After modification, it could only reach 50% of the planned efficiency. The technical personnel did not adhere to the correct principle of designing before construction for the construction of this project; the administrative cadres did not proceed from reality, did not realize the importance of technology in modern enterprises, and held a scientific attitude, only relied on narrow experience to handle affairs, and ignored the importance of design, resulting in rework and waste.

    The above fully shows that there is a serious subjective tendency in the guiding ideology of the Datong Mining Bureau. Whether it is blindly carrying out recovery according to the old foundation, blindly planning construction, or the empiricist practice of underestimating design, it is entirely caused by our eagerness to achieve success. We tried to quickly restore the mines of the Datong Mining Bureau in order to promote the development of the national economy and accumulate wealth for the country. This enthusiasm is good, but we did not consider our own subjective strength, but only carried out work based on subjective wishes and enthusiasm. As a result, although the recovery project in 1950 was completed according to the original plan, the principle of steady progress in key construction was not grasped, resulting in extreme confusion and serious waste in the work. This is the result of subjectivism and doing things solely based on wishes and enthusiasm. Therefore, if you want to do a good job in basic construction, you must comprehensively and deeply understand the situation, consider the production situation and development prospects based on objective conditions and subjective strength, determine the purpose of construction; then determine the plan, carry out the design, and carry out the work according to the construction plan, in order to overcome the blindness of basic construction, and overcome the confusion and waste in the project.

    Another deviation in the guiding ideology of basic construction of Datong Mining Bureau is the lack of a development perspective. Our construction work in 1950 was carried out on the old foundation of the enemy and puppets, with the aim of restoring to the production level of the enemy and puppets. We thought it would be good to be able to restore to the old level. Therefore, all production processes are designed, arranged, and equipped with machinery according to the old methods. This practice is actually a passive maintenance of the old production, a kind of conservative thinking, rather than an active reform of the old production methods. The first National Coal Mine Conference put forward a production reform plan, and pointed out that this plan is a revolution in the coal mine industry, requiring everyone to actively reform the existing production methods. But we did not realize this. On the contrary, we still stayed on the old production methods and could not accept new things. At the joint meeting of the directors of the North China Mining Bureaus, the higher authorities emphasized and criticized our conservative thinking that we could not accept new things. Although this criticism gave us a blow to the head and made us realize that it is necessary to reform production methods, a new concern threatened us. We were afraid that the reform would not be good and would affect the promotion of the entire production reform, and would affect production; we were afraid that the new methods would bring us insecurity, so we hesitated and were reluctant to give up the old methods. We did not implement the resolutions of the National Coal Mine Conference with a positive and serious attitude. This delayed the speed of progress in coal mining technology. At the Bureau's cadre meeting, this idea was strictly criticized, breaking the concerns, and pointing out that we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in order to liberate ourselves from the old production methods and enable the coal mining industry to take a step forward. In this way, in the third quarter of 1950, the production reform plan was implemented with a positive attitude.

    The above situation shows that we have conservative thinking not only in basic construction but also in production methods. The root of this idea is still subjectivism. It makes us stick to conventions, doubt new things, and on the one hand, we want to immediately restore production, but on the other hand, we think that "the existing is reasonable," lack foresight, and dare not boldly organize forces, improve institutions, and carry out reforms, so that the guiding ideology is limited to the desire to restore the old appearance, resulting in serious contradictions between subjective wishes and objective reality in the work, and the work is damaged and enthusiasm is hit. As Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Practice": "Vulgar pragmatists... they respect experience and despise theory, and therefore cannot see the whole of the objective process, lack a clear direction, have no grand prospects, and are complacent with a little success and a narrow view. If such people guide the revolution, they will lead the revolution to a dead end." This is a portrayal of our subjectivists. We must accept this lesson to improve our future work.

    主观主义是基本建设的最大敌人
    大同矿务局局长  何水
    大同矿务局一九五○年的工作方针是“恢复为主，生产为辅”。一九五○年恢复工作中的基本建设工程曾经发生了不少问题。我们在进行基本建设工作时，没有掌握基本建设的程序，不经过详细地调查研究，认真地讨论比较，仅凭主观愿望热情，就作计划，有了计划就想施工。这样的计划往往是粗枝大叶，缺乏长远打算，缺乏统一的技术领导，以至动工后变动很大，返工、重建的事情层出不穷，使国家财富遭到不应有的损失。这种主观主义作风的表现形式有以下各种：
    第一，按照旧基础盲目进行恢复。大同矿务局一九五○年是在“恢复为主，生产为辅”的方针下进行工作的，本局所属各矿在解放前遭到敌人的惨重破坏，原来一万八千多马力的发电设备尽遭破坏，机器残缺不全，十三个坑井被水淹没，十五万平方米的厂房尽成断壁颓垣。俗话说：“破家值万贯”，我们总认为如果尽速地把它在旧基础上恢复起来，就可以大量生产，为国家积累财富。在这种思想支配下，我们就常常不作仔细的调查研究，就盲目利用旧基础进行恢复工作。比如，第三矿九号井绞车房的恢复，就是利用了旧的绞车座和残破的绞车进行设计的，恢复工作一共用去了五万七千斤小米。但是机房盖好未满一年，旧绞车座即行破裂。经过研究，才发觉这个绞车座曾经过二次火烧，一次爆炸，外表虽尚完整，力量已不能支持，因此，必须重建机房。当时原以为照旧样修起来可以省钱，结果反而造成浪费。在这种盲目利用旧基础的思想支配下，不少建筑都没有根据实际情况，作长期打算，以致遭到了和绞车房同样的结果。
    第二，不考虑主客观条件，草率进行恢复工作。这一点特别表现在恢复火药厂的工作中。一九五○年的恢复工程计划里，并没有列入恢复火药厂的项目。三、四月的时候，煤矿管理总局负责同志协同本局负责同志参观火药厂旧基后，大家感到煤矿的火药消耗量很多，占成本的比例也大，如果我们把火药厂恢复起来，一方面可保证产量，另一方面还可降低成本。就这样草率地决定了恢复火药厂。对于目前我们是否有条件去恢复，要恢复到什么程度以及年产多少，都没有作详细的研究，就盲目地动了工。结果房子盖好以后，还不知道机器在那里，技术人员从那里调。只好先进行手工生产。进行手工生产效率很低，保安条件也很差，于是又重新决定增添机器设备。增添设备又需要到一九五一年才能向东北订货，这样，一年来整个工厂便处在半生产半停工的状态中。这个工程的进行完全是盲目的，只凭几个负责干部的灵机一动，就作了主观主义的决定。这种主观主义的决定问题，只能把事情办坏，不会把事情办好。
    第三，轻视设计的思想。为了急于完成恢复计划，一九五○年的每个工程在事前都没有进行详细的设计。大多数的工程是只有粗糙的计划，就开始动工，在工程进行中一面设计，一面施工。由于轻视设计工作，所以就没有建立负责全盘的设计机构。土木、机电、采煤等设计，都是各自进行，互不联系。部分行政管理干部甚至认为“设计太麻烦，耽误了修建时间”；认为“老百姓没有画图，还不是也盖成了房子”；认为“技术人员设计后的估价反比工人估价高”，于是产生了“不如不设计”的错误思想。在这种错误思想的支配下，有的工程不经过设计即行动工。如：几个行政干部看见六号井东一大巷日产煤五○○吨，用推车工一二○名，经常发生掉道撞伤事故，于是就打算改善运搬设备，安装无极绳，以便保证安全，节省人力，提高效率。当召集技术人员进行研究时，技术人员主张经过测量设计后再决定。行政干部当时急于求成，不采纳技术人员的意见，决定一面动工，一面设计。因为事先没有测量设计，所以安装了无极绳以后，才感到巷道曲折太多，路基不好，不能使用，经过修改，仅能达到原计划效率的百分之五十。技术人员对这一工程的兴建，没有坚持先设计后施工的正确原则；行政干部不从实际出发，没认识到技术在现代企业中的重要性，抱着违反科学的态度，只凭狭隘的经验办事，忽视了设计的重要，以致造成返工浪费。
    以上这些，充分说明大同矿务局的领导思想上存在着严重的主观主义倾向，无论是按照旧基础盲目进行恢复，无论是盲目计划施工，以及轻视设计的经验主义作法，完全是由于我们的急于求成所造成的。我们企图很快地把大同矿务局各矿恢复起来，以促进国民经济的发展，为国家积累财富，这种积极性是好的，但是我们却没有考虑自己的主观力量，而是只凭主观愿望，和工作热情来进行工作。这样作的结果，虽然一九五○年的恢复工程照原计划完成了，可是没有掌握住重点建设稳步前进的方针，以致在工作中造成了极度混乱和严重浪费的现象。这是主观主义，单凭愿望和热情办事所造成的结果。所以要想搞好基本建设，必须全面地深入地了解情况，根据客观条件和主观力量，考虑生产的情况和发展前途，确定建设的目的；然后确定计划，进行设计，根据施工计划，进行工作，才能克服基本建设的盲目性，才能克服工程进行中的混乱现象和浪费现象。
    大同矿务局基本建设的领导思想中的另一偏向是没有发展观点。我们一九五○年的建设工作是照敌伪时的旧基础进行的，目的是要恢复到敌伪时的生产水平。我们认为能够恢复到旧有程度就不错了。所以一切生产过程，均按旧的方法来设计布置，配备机械。这种作法实际上是消极的维持旧生产，是一种保守思想，而不是积极的变革旧的生产方法。第一次全国煤矿会议提出了生产改革方案，并指出这个方案是煤矿事业的一个革命，要求大家积极地改革现有生产方法。可是我们没有认识到这一点。相反地我们仍旧停留在旧的生产方法上，对新的事物不能接受。在华北各矿务局局长联席会上，上级曾着重批判了我们不能接受新事物的保守思想。这个批评虽然给了我们当头一棒，使我们猛省于改革生产方法是必要的，然而一个新的顾虑威胁着我们。我们怕改不好会影响整个生产改革的推行，会影响生产；怕新的方法带给我们不安全，以致犹疑不决，对旧的方法恋恋不舍，没有用积极认真的态度，去执行全国煤矿会议的决议。这样就延缓了采煤技术的进步速度。在本局干部会议上，严格地批判了这种思想，打破了顾虑，指出必须学习苏联先进经验，才能从旧的生产方法中解放出来，才能使煤矿工业跃进一步。这样在一九五○年第三季，才以积极态度贯彻了生产改革方案。
    上述情况，说明我们不但在基本建设上甚至在生产方法上都存在着保守思想。这个思想的根源，也还是主观主义。它使我们死守成规，怀疑新的事物，一方面愿意使生产立即得到恢复，一方面却认为“现有的就是合理的”，缺乏远见，不敢大胆地组织力量，健全机构，进行改革，使领导思想拘限在恢复旧观的愿望里，致使主观愿望和客观实际在工作中表现了严重的矛盾，工作受到损失，热情受到打击。毛主席在实践论中指出的：“庸俗的事务主义家……他们尊重经验而看轻理论，因而不能通观客观过程的全体，缺乏明确的方针，没有远大的前途，沾沾自喜于一得之功和一孔之见。这种人如果指导革命，就会引导革命走上碰壁的地步。”正是我们主观主义者的一个写照。我们必须接受这个教训，来改进我们今后的工作。
