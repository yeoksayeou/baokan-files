The British people's observation delegation member and Secretary of the Britain-China Friendship Association, Mr. Deri Bowen, delivered a farewell speech to the Chinese people before leaving China. The recording of the speech was broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 26th. The full text of the speech is as follows:

This is my first short visit to a country that I knew so well and often talked about in distant Britain. My main impression is: How foolish it is that our government wants to turn back the clock and does not want to maintain peace, trade, and friendship with this great people!

The boiling enthusiasm of the entire Chinese people must be seen to be believed. Today I visited a village near Beijing. We met an old lady, and I asked her some questions. She was taken aback, but when she started talking, she couldn't help but tell me about the wonderful life she and her family are now living.

I met a railway worker from Qiqihar at the Railway Exhibition. He explained to me how his living standards have improved sixfold compared to before, how he was beaten under the Kuomintang regime, and how he couldn't read or write. Now, in the new society, he is seen as an important person.

From the expressions and enthusiasm of the people I saw everywhere in factories and villages, and from all these common signs, it is clear that the people here realize that they have the freedom to build a new life and are confident that they have the ability to do so. There is a vitality in everything they do, which well illustrates what kind of leadership this country has. First of all, the great progress made here in the two years since the establishment of the People's Government can be seen from the youth and children.

Our people hope to live in peace, trade, and maintain friendly relations with the new China. They do not approve of the US trade blockade, nor do they approve of the imperialist war in Korea. As Secretary of the Britain-China Friendship Association, I know that every time peace and friendly relations with China are mentioned at meetings, it is greeted with cheers. Despite the best efforts of the reactionaries, the people still hate the Korean War and hope to let British soldiers return home. Our Britain-China Friendship Association is newly established. We now have nearly 600,000 members. Our membership will continue to grow, because the existing deep friendship with China is combined with activities that are beneficial to both the British and Chinese people. Our Britain-China Friendship Association has put forward a resolution in Britain demanding the withdrawal of all troops from Korea. As I am about to leave your country, I am deeply inspired by your heroism and your enthusiasm for peace and construction. I promise to tell the British people everything you are doing and help the many British people who are determined to build Sino-British friendship to carry out this work.

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and British people!

Long live your great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong!

    英国人民热望与新中国友好
    ——英中友好协会秘书德里邦向中国人民告别的演说
    英国人民观礼代表、英中友好协会秘书德里邦在离华前夕发表向中国人民告别的演说，演说录音在二十六日晚由中央人民广播电台广播，演说全文如下：
    这次是我第一次来到我远在英国就已知道得很清楚而且常常谈论的国家作短时间的访问。我所得到的主要印象是：我国政府想要使时钟倒转，不想与这个伟大人民保持和平、进行贸易和友好，是多么愚蠢啊！
    中国全体人民的沸腾的热情要在看到之后才会相信。今天我访问了北京近郊的一个村庄。我们遇见一位老太太，我向她提出了一些问题。她感到很突然，但当她开始谈起来的时候，她就情不自禁地告诉我她和她的一家人现在所过的美好生活。
    我在铁路展览会遇到的一位齐齐哈尔的铁路工人，他向我解释他的生活水平怎样比以前提高了六倍，他在国民党政权下怎样挨打，并且不会念书不会写字。现在他在新社会中已被看成重要的人物了。
    从我在工厂和村庄里到处看到的人们的神态和热烈的情绪，从这一切通常的标志看来，这里的人们意识到他们有建立新生活的自由，并且深信他们有能力这样做。他们进行的一切工作中都有一种朝气，这很好地说明了这个国家的领导是什么样子的领导。首先，从青年和儿童身上就可以看到人民政府成立以来的两年当中，这里有了多么伟大的进步。
    我国人民希望与新中国和平相处，进行贸易，并维持友好关系。他们不赞成美国的贸易封锁，也不赞成在朝鲜进行的帝国主义战争。我是英中友好协会秘书，我知道在每次集会上，每一提到与中国和平相处并保持友好关系，就得到欢呼。尽管反动派用尽心机，人民仍然痛恨朝鲜战争，希望让英国士兵回国。我们英中友好协会是新成立的。我们的会员现在将近六十万人。我们的会员还会不断增加，因为现存的对中国的深厚的友谊是结合着对英中两国人民都有利的活动的。我们英中友好协会已在英国提出要求一切军队从朝鲜撤退的决议。我在行将离开贵国之际，深受你们的英雄主义和你们对和平与建设的热情所鼓舞。我保证一定把你们正在做的一切告诉英国人民，并帮助决心建立英中友谊的许许多多英国人民进行这种工作。
    英中人民友谊万岁！
    你们的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
