Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: People in various places are purchasing the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and are preparing to study them diligently. The first batch of the first volume of Selected Works of Mao Zedong has a total distribution of 600,000 copies. In many places, the number of orders placed by readers has exceeded the quantity that local Xinhua bookstores can supply. According to statistics from Jinan, Xuzhou, and Qingdao, the number of orders placed by readers exceeds the actual supply of bookstores in the three cities by more than 150%. According to statistics from the Beijing branch of Xinhua Bookstore, within three days, 785 households came to pre-order, requiring more than 67,000 copies. In Yinchuan City, Ningxia, people of all ethnic groups pre-ordered 425 copies on the afternoon of the 13th. 10,000 copies sold in Guangzhou were completely sold out.

Many readers, after purchasing the first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, expressed their determination to study diligently. Zhao Zhankui, a nationally renowned industrial labor hero, said when he obtained the first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong: "Chinese workers must master Mao Zedong Thought well in order to lead the people of the whole country to build their own country, and move from a new democratic society to a socialist and communist society." Li Shihai, a model worker in Nanjing industry, said: "We workers were able to turn ourselves around because we had Mao Zedong Thought. The Selected Works of Mao Zedong will help me improve politically and culturally, and further promote me to produce more, invent more, and create more." Wang Yaodong, a farmer cadre studying at the Wanbei Party School, decided to set aside one hour of rest time every day to read from today. Liu Menggu, a 69-year-old member of the Tongmenghui in Hunan, rushed to Changsha from six miles away. After purchasing the first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, he said: "During the Qing Dynasty, I and Huang Xing made revolution together, but it was unsuccessful. Today, the revolution is victorious because we have Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, so we must study Chairman Mao's works well." Yue Jieheng, the academic dean of Northwest University, said: "We educators should first master Mao Zedong Thought ourselves in order to educate the next generation of youth in the motherland to become talents for national construction." Many soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, sailors, students, and cadres of fraternal ethnic groups wrote in the opinion books of Xinhua bookstores in various places: "I am as happy as seeing Chairman Mao when I bought this book." "When I study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, I feel that Chairman Mao is standing in front of me, pointing out the direction forward."

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: On the eve of the publication of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, more than 500 party members and government cadres of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province held a meeting. Zhang Bangying, the third secretary of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, gave a special report on "Striving to Study Mao Zedong Thought." He called on cadres of all ethnic groups in the province to study Mao Zedong's works diligently and widely and deeply disseminate Mao Zedong Thought. He stated at the meeting that the Selected Works of Mao Zedong will be published in the languages of the main ethnic minorities in Xinjiang Province. This news was warmly welcomed by cadres of all ethnic groups.

The Xinjiang General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore began selling the first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong on the 12th, and cadres of all ethnic groups eagerly went to purchase them. In addition to selling the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Xinhua Bookstore also sells the Uighur, Kazakh, and Mongolian versions of Chairman Mao's works: "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." Zhang Xiqin and Wang Enmao, members of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC, also published their essays on studying Mao Zedong's works, especially "On Practice," in the Xinjiang Daily.
