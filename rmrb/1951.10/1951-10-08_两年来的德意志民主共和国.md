    Two Years of the German Democratic Republic
    John Koenig, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic to China, with the Rank of Ambassador
    When the founding of the People's Republic of China, a powerful pillar of peace in Asia, was deeply shaking the world in 1949, less than a few days later, a new democratic republic was established in Europe. This news filled friends of peace around the world with new joy. This country, the German Democratic Republic, was born in the struggle for peace, for the national unity and independence of the German people. Therefore, the German people celebrate this year's October 7th with the words of the great statesman and peace fighter Marshal Stalin: "The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a turning point in European history" as a symbol. The German Democratic Republic has fully demonstrated the significance of this important statement by strengthening the struggle to defend peace and build a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.
    The policy of the government of the German Democratic Republic, from the first day of its establishment, has been based on the international obligations stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement; based on friendship with all peace-loving people; especially on friendship with the great socialist Soviet Union—because it liberated the German people from fascist oppression, and because of it, the German people have obtained the opportunity for democratic prosperity; and also based on the unwavering will to defend peace and strive for the democratic reunification of Germany. Within the territory of the German Democratic Republic, various reforms have been carried out thanks to the advance protection and exemplary assistance of the Soviet occupying forces, so that the democratic and peaceful development of the Republic has a solid foundation. The most reliable guarantee for such development in the spirit of friendship with all peoples is the working class, which plays a decisive role politically and economically within the German Democratic Republic under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.
    The policy of American imperialism and other imperialist allies is to turn the divided West Germany into an arms manufacturing plant, a source of cannon fodder, and a launching base for a new world war. The struggle of the National Front of Democratic Germany against division, and the struggle for democratic unity and the conclusion of a peace treaty, are also struggles to defend European peace and consolidate friendship among nations. In this struggle of all patriotic German people, the German Democratic Republic and its government are the most reliable supporters. Its political and economic achievements are a model for the whole of Germany. The second year of the Republic's establishment has shown new and significant progress in the economic, political, and cultural fields. In October 1950, 99.7 percent of the 98.5 percent of voters participating in the People's Election voted in favor of peace and elected candidates of the National Front of Democratic Germany.
    Economically, the German Democratic Republic is also showing a continued significant improvement. The recovery period, which was indispensable after the war damage, is coming to an end due to the completion of the Two-Year Plan. A new construction period has also begun. The increase in production and productivity, the decline in costs and prices, the improvement of people's lives, and the achievements in the first half of the Five-Year Plan all show the rapid rise of an economy of a country that is free from imperialist bondage and has the friendly support of the Soviet Union and the democratic countries in the peace camp. At the same time, it presents to the people of West Germany what kind of flourishing prosperity a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, liberated from imperialist oppression and the threat of war, would experience.
    These achievements all show that the government of the German Democratic Republic enjoys the full trust of the people, and that the struggle of the National Front has become a broad mass movement. Even in West Germany, people who are resisting the increasingly obvious remilitarization and engaging in resistance struggles are increasingly joining this movement.
    In 1951, under the slogan of "Saving Peace," 1,700 representatives from all walks of life and from all parts of West Germany, along with a French and a British member of the World Peace Council, convened a conference against German remilitarization and rearmament. In the declaration of this conference, an urgent appeal was made to the German people to fight against the active preparations of foreign imperialists who were forcing the German people to participate in a third world war.
    "A third world war must be prevented, and peace can be saved if the German people use their democratic rights to decide their own destiny, to decide war or peace, and to express their will to reject remilitarization through a popular vote. Only in this way can the peace and a bright future for our people be guaranteed." This is what the declaration of the Essen Conference called for.
    After this, the resistance movement in West Germany continued to expand unstoppably. The actions of farmers in the Mein region who refused to give up their land designated as military training grounds, the heroic resistance of German youth and fishermen who destroyed the island of Helgoland to oppose British Air Force bombing training, the struggle of Ruhr miners against increasing coal production for the purpose of manufacturing armaments, the strike movement of metalworkers, and the struggle against the remilitarization of the Adenauer government, a lackey of American imperialism, and the right-wing Social Democratic trade union chairmen, etc.—these are just a few examples of the growing will to struggle of the German people.
    Another example is the result of the popular vote against German remilitarization and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951. In the German Democratic Republic, more than 13 million people, or 99.5 percent of the voters, were against remilitarization and in favor of concluding a peace treaty. Within West Germany, despite the various prohibitions and terror measures of the imperialist "High Commissioners" and the Bonn puppet government, 80 to 90 percent of the people who still held a popular vote were against remilitarization and in favor of demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.
    At this time, the German struggle for peace entered another new stage. American imperialism is fully aware that the German people do not want war and that the vast majority are against remilitarization. Therefore, they use the Adenauer government as an accomplice to gather the heads of konzerns and banks, former Hitler officers, and the Schumacher group to deceive and intimidate the West German people, to force them to accept the intentions of the war profiteers; to create a fait accompli by accelerating the manufacture of German armaments, training troops, and supporting established fascist and military organizations, and to turn West Germany into an arms manufacturing base, a source of cannon fodder, and a launching base for a new American war. At the same time, it is promoting the revival of German imperialism and intends to place them in an important position in Europe. As a result, West Germany has become a primary source of danger. The threat of war has entered a new and dangerous stage.
    The White Paper published in August 1951 by the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany pointed out: "The threat caused by German imperialism concerns the people of the whole of Europe, whether they are French or German, Soviet, British, Belgian or Italian.
    The struggle of the German people against remilitarization and the war crisis, from its current effect: assuming that the German people—the vast majority of whom are peace-loving and as urgently need peace as other countries—do their best to defend peace, to prevent the realization of West German remilitarization, and to establish a peace-loving and democratically unified Germany, then the conspiracy of the war profiteers cannot succeed. The German people bear a great responsibility for peace. It is up to their actions to determine whether the war-mad imperialists will be able to implement their conspiracy, or whether peace can be saved."
    After this, the three Western imperialist powers continued to strengthen their war preparations policy, and at the Washington Conference decided to accelerate the militarization of West Germany and drag it into the system of the aggressive Atlantic Alliance. Regarding the nature of the Washington Conference, whose resolutions represent a serious threat to peace and millions of German people, Prime Minister Grotewohl stated in his statement on behalf of the government on September 15, 1951:
    "What happened to Japan in San Francisco will inevitably fall on Germany in Washington in a different form. The agreement to include West Germany in the American war conspiracy and openly restore German militarism has been signed in exclusion of Germany's eastern neighbors, especially the Soviet Union, and regardless of the clear will of the German people themselves."
    The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, after the government statement, filled with deep concern for the peace of the German people and the peace of the people of Europe, called on all the German people and the Bonn Federal Parliament:
    1. Decide to use free, equal, and secret elections throughout Germany
    to elect an all-German People's Chamber to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany;
    2. Demand the acceleration of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the immediate withdrawal of all occupying forces.
    The Adenauer government rejected this proposal. On the contrary, among the German people, this appeal from the representatives of the people of the German Democratic Republic has gained widespread support. The mobilizing effect of the unwavering efforts of the government of the German Democratic Republic for the unity of Germany and the defense of peace among the broad masses of the people in West Germany is enough to illustrate the importance of the German Democratic Republic in the struggle for peace in Europe. Even the greatest enemies must admit that the German Democratic Republic has become a very important factor in the political situation in Germany and in international affairs. The German Democratic Republic dedicates its strength to the cause of peace; to the cause of peaceful and friendly cooperation with the people of all countries; to the cause of national unity. Therefore, the anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic is also a festival of peace, and a day to celebrate friendship with the people of all countries.
    The two years of development of the German Democratic Republic also show the development of its friendship with all peace-loving people. In economic, political, and cultural achievements, the German Democratic Republic should first of all thank the creativity of the working people in the country, the decisive influence of the Marxist-Leninist party of the working class and the establishment of the anti-fascist democratic order, and should thank the friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Europe and the People's Republic of China.
    The fact that the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation, the World Peace Council, and the World Youth and Student Peace Festival were all held in Berlin this year can be regarded on the one hand as an expression of mutual trust between friendly people of various countries and the German Democratic Republic, and on the other hand as the expression of the historical position of the German Democratic Republic in the meaning of Stalin's words. The friendship between nations, especially the friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, gives the German Democratic Republic and the patriotic elements in West Germany infinite strength and confidence in completing their arduous tasks.
    During the Sino-German Friendship Month, the National Committee of the National Front called out:
    "Consolidating Sino-German friendship, in addition to Soviet-German friendship, is a powerful weapon in the struggle against American imperialism and its conspiracy to divide Germany, enslave the German people, and lead to another new world war. Sino-German friendship is a decisive contribution to strengthening the world peace camp."
    At the beginning of the third year of its founding, the German Democratic Republic has the firm wish that it must prove that it is worthy of the friendship and trust of its friends, especially that it cannot fail Stalin's words. It will do its best, and be filled with a consciousness of its great responsibility, and continue to strive to fulfill its historical task in the struggle for peace and German unity.

    两年来的德意志民主共和国
    德意志民主共和国驻华外交使团大使衔团长  约翰·柯尼希
    当一九四九年亚洲和平的强大支柱——中华人民共和国的成立正深深地震撼着世界的时候，不到几天，欧洲又成立了一个新的民主共和国。这个消息使得全世界和平的朋友们又充满了新的欢乐。这个国家，这个德意志民主共和国就在争取和平、争取德国人民的国家统一和独立的斗争中诞生了。因此德国人民以伟大的政治家与和平战士斯大林大元帅所说的“德意志民主共和国的成立是欧洲历史的转折点”这句话作为标志，来庆祝今年的十月七日。德意志民主共和国用加强捍卫和平与建立一个统一民主爱好和平的德国的斗争，把这个重要声明的意义充分地表现出来。
    德意志民主共和国政府的政策，从它成立的第一天起，就是建立在波茨坦协定规定的所应负的国际义务上；建立在与一切爱好和平人民的友好上；尤其是在与伟大的社会主义苏联的友好上——因为它把德国人民从法西斯的压迫下解放出来，由于它，德国人民才获得了民主繁荣的机会；并且还建立在捍卫和平与争取德国民主统一的坚决不挠的意志上。在德意志民主共和国的领土内，因为苏联占领军在事先的保护和模范的协助而能进行了各种改革，所以使得共和国的民主和平的发展有了巩固的基础。对于在与各国人民友好的精神中这样发展的最可靠的保证，就是在德国统一社会党领导下的、在德意志民主共和国境内政治上和经济上起决定作用的工人阶级。
    美帝国主义的政策以及其他各帝国主义盟国的政策，都是打算把西德分裂国家变成军火制造厂、炮灰供应所和新世界大战的进军基地。民主德国全国阵线反对分裂的斗争，以及要求民主统一和缔结和约的斗争，同时也就是捍卫欧洲和平与巩固各民族友好的斗争。在这个一切爱国的德国人民的斗争里，德意志民主共和国及其政府是最可靠的支持者。它在政治上和经济上的成就正是全德国的榜样。共和国成立的第二年中更呈现了在经济政治和文化各方面的新的显著的进步。一九五○年十月，参加人民选举的百分之九十八点五的选民中有百分之九十九点七投票赞成和平，选举了民主德国全国阵线的候选人。
    在经济上，德意志民主共和国也表现着继续显著的好转。经过战争破坏后不可缺少的恢复时期，已经由于两年计划的完成而即将结束。新建设时期也已开始了。生产品和生产力的增加，成本和物价的下降，人民生活的改善以及五年计划头半年中的成绩在在都显示着一个不受帝国主义束缚而有着苏联以及和平阵营中各民主国家的友好支持的国家的经济的迅速上升。同时呈现在西德人民面前的是：由帝国主义的压迫和战争威胁中解放出来的统一、民主、爱好和平的德国，当会经历到何等样的茂盛繁荣。
    这些成就都表示出德意志民主共和国的政府享有人民充分的信任，而全国阵线的斗争也已变成了广泛的群众运动。连在西德的为了抗拒日益明显的重新军国主义化和进行反抗斗争的人民，也日渐增多地投入到这个运动之中。
    一九五一年内在“挽救和平”的口号下，有来自各人民阶层和西德各处的一千七百个代表，另外有世界和平理事会的一位法国和一位英国理事的出席，召开了一个反对德国重新军国主义化和重整军备的大会。在这大会的宣言中向德国人民发出紧急号召，进行反对外国帝国主义者强迫德国人民参加第三次世界大战的积极准备的斗争。
    “第三次世界大战一定会被制止，和平也是能够挽救的，如果德国人民使用他们的民主权利来决定他们自己的命运，来决定战争或者和平，并且用民意投票来表示他们拒绝重新军国主义化的意志。唯有如此，才可以保障我们人民的和平与美好的将来。”在埃森大会的宣言中这样号召着。
    此后，在西德的反抗运动日益不可遏止地不断扩展起来。曼因区域农民拒绝让出他们被指定作为军事教练场的土地的行动，德国青年和渔民为了反对英空军训练投弹而摧毁黑葛兰岛的英勇反抗，鲁尔区矿工进行的反对为制造军火的目的而增加煤产量的斗争，五金工人的罢工运动以及反对美帝国主义奴才阿登纳政府和右翼社会民主党工会主席的重新军国主义化的斗争等等——这些仅仅是德国人民日益增长着的斗争意志的几个事例。
    还有另外一个事例，就是：反对德国重新军国主义化与要求一九五一年内对德缔结和约的民意投票的结果。在德意志民主共和国内超过一千三百万人，即选民中的百分之九十九点五是反对重新军国主义化与赞成缔结和约的。在西德境内，不顾帝国主义“高级专员”和波恩傀儡政府的各种禁令和恐怖措施，而仍然举行了民意投票的人民，其中百分之八十至九十是反对重新军国主义化与赞成要求一九五一年内对德缔结和约的。
    这个时候德国争取和平的斗争又进入了另一个新阶段。美帝国主义完全清楚：德国人民是不愿意战争的，并且绝大多数都是反对重新军国主义化的。因此他们利用阿登纳政府作帮凶，去搜罗康采恩和银行的头子们，过去希特勒的军官们以及舒马赫集团来欺骗、恐吓西德人民，来强迫他们接受战争贩子的意图；用加速推动制造德国军火、编训军队和支持已成立的法西斯以及军事组织来造成既成事实，而将西德变成制造军火的基地、炮灰供应所和一个新的美国战争的进军基地。同时又促使德国帝国主义的复活，并打算把他们安放在欧洲重要的位置上去。由此西德变成了一个首要的危险策源地。战争的威胁又进入了一个新的危险阶段。
    一九五一年八月民主德国全国阵线全国委员会发表的白皮书中指出了：“由于德国帝国主义而引起的威胁，是关系着整个欧洲的人民的，无论是法国人民或德国人民都一样，苏联人民，英国人民，比利时或意大利人民都没有例外。
    德国人民反对重新军国主义化和战争危机的斗争，从其到目前的效果上看来：假设德国人民——他们之中绝大多数是热爱和平，且也和别国人民一样迫切需要和平的——尽其全力来捍卫和平，来阻止西德重新军国主义化的实现，来建立一个爱好和平和民主的统一德国，那么战争贩子的阴谋是无法得逞的。在德国人民身上负担着对和平的重大责任。全靠他们的行动来决定：究竟是否战争狂的帝国主义者能够实施他们的阴谋；或者和平究竟能否挽救。”
    此后西方三帝国主义者继续加强了他们的备战政策，并且在华盛顿会议上决定加速西德军国主义化并把它拖入侵略性的大西洋联盟各国的体系中。关于华盛顿会议的性质，其决议是表现着对和平和千百万德国人民严重威胁的，总理格罗提渥于一九五一年九月十五日在其代表政府的声明中指示：
    “在旧金山对日本发生的事情，又必将换一种形式在华盛顿落在德国头上。把西德包括进美国战争阴谋和公然恢复德国军国主义的协议，已经在排斥德国东面邻国，尤其是苏联，并且在不顾德国人民自己的明确意志的情况下签订起来了。”
    德意志民主共和国的人民议会，在政府声明之后，因充满了对德国人民和平以及欧洲各国人民的和平的深切关怀而向全德人民和波恩联邦议会呼吁：
    1、决定在全德境内用自由平等秘密选举办法，
    选举全德国民议会，以成立统一民主和爱好和
    平的德国；
    2、要求加速缔结对德和约，并随即撤退各国占
    领军。
    阿登纳政府拒绝了这个建议。在德国人民之中却相反，这个德意志民主共和国人民代表们的呼吁获得了普遍的拥护。德意志民主共和国政府为了德国的统一和捍卫和平的百折不挠的努力在西德广大人民群众之中所发生的动员效果，足以说明德意志民主共和国在争取欧洲和平的斗争中所据有的重要性。即使最大的敌人也不得不承认：德意志民主共和国在德国的政治情势以及国际事务上变成了一个极重要的因素。德意志民主共和国把它的力量献给争取和平的事业；献给争取与各国人民和平友好合作的事业；献给争取国家统一的事业了。所以，德意志民主共和国的成立纪念日，同时也就是和平的节日，也就是庆祝与各国人民友好的日子。
    德意志民主共和国两年来的发展，也同时表现了它和一切爱好和平人民友好的发展。在经济、政治以及文化各方面的成就，德意志民主共和国首先应当感谢本国内劳动人民的创造，工人阶级的马克思——列宁政党的决定性的影响和反法西斯的民主秩序的建立，应当感谢苏联以及欧洲各人民民主国家和中华人民共和国的友谊和协助。
    国际民主妇联理事会，世界和平理事会以及世界青年与学生和平联欢节今年都在柏林举行，这个事实一方面可以认为是各国友好人民与德意志民主共和国之间互相信任的表示，同时也可以看作是：德意志民主共和国的历史地位如斯大林所说的话中意义的表现。各民族间的友谊，尤其是苏联和中华人民共和国的友谊使得德意志民主共和国以及西德的爱国分子，在完成他们艰巨的任务上获得了无穷的力量和信心。
    在德中友好月时，全国阵线全国委员会的号召中曾说：
    “巩固德中友好，是除了德苏友好之外，在反对美帝国主义及其分裂德国、奴役德国人民和导向另一次新的世界大战的阴谋斗争中的有力武器。德中友好对于加强世界和平阵营是一个决定性的贡献。”
    德意志民主共和国在它成立第三年开始的时候，怀着坚决的愿望：它必定能证实不辜负朋友们对它的友好和信赖，尤其是不能辜负斯大林的话。它将竭尽全力，并且充满着对它重大责任的自觉心，而继续为了完成其在争取和平与德国统一的斗争中所担负的历史任务而努力。
