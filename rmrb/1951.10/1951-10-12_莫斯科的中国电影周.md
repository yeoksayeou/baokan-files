    Chinese Film Week in Moscow
    Te Liegubofu
    Starting from October 1st, the major cinemas in the Soviet capital are holding the People's Republic of China Film Week.
    The entrances of Moscow's cinemas are decorated with bright advertising posters, displaying the titles of the films that will be shown to Muscovites during the film week. The national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are flying on top of the buildings. In the lobbies of many cinemas, photo exhibitions are being held, showcasing the labor achievements and cultural achievements of the Chinese people, who recently celebrated a significant day – the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the center of the photo exhibition in the lobby of the "Udarnik" cinema, there is a red banner with the words from the congratulatory message of the great Stalin to Comrade Mao Zedong:
    "May the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics – a strong guarantee of peace and security in the Far East – be forever consolidated."
    Stalin's words express the thoughts and feelings of the entire Soviet people, who are committed to comprehensively consolidating the unbreakable friendship with the Chinese people. The special interest shown by Soviet audiences in Chinese film works is extremely natural. This interest is not only evident in artistic films but also in documentaries that faithfully record many real events, showcasing the achievements of the Chinese people in various fields under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great leader Mao Zedong.
    In the four days since the opening of the People's Republic of China Film Week, audiences at all cinemas in Moscow screening Chinese films have been extremely enthusiastic.
    In the "Udarnik," "Art," and "Moscow" cinemas alone, more than 55,000 viewers have watched "The White Haired Girl." At the "Daily News" cinema, which only shows Chinese documentaries, the audience has exceeded 15,000 in four days.
    Before each film screening, the cinemas hold thematic reports: "The Achievements of the Chinese People in Peaceful Construction" and "The Permanent and Unbreakable Friendship between the Soviet and Chinese Peoples is a Guarantee of Peace and Security in the Far East."
    Members of the Chinese film workers delegation who came to the Soviet Union for the film week were warmly welcomed by the Muscovites who went to the cinemas.
    After watching the films, viewers write their opinions in the criticism book. In the past four days, dozens of viewer opinions have been left in the criticism book of the "Art" cinema.
    Students Maksimov, Miniayev, and Malkin wrote: "We watched the film 'The White Haired Girl' with special attention. The film's realistic artistry and dramatic subject matter moved us. It is impossible not to be moved by the fate of Xi'er, the daughter of a peasant who suffered all the horrors of landlord oppression. When Xi'er joins the ranks of the people's democratic fighters to achieve a free life with them and to eliminate the old landlord and feudal system, we and the entire audience are delighted. We really like the music in this film, especially the song sung by the peasants at the end, who are joyfully singing because tragic stories like Xi'er's will never happen again on Chinese soil. We thank the filmmakers of our friendly and great China for this realistic and good film."
    Soviet military officer Ivan Sigalov wrote: "We Soviet people are always happy for any achievement of progressive democratic art. That is why we are so pleased to see the new Chinese film 'The White Haired Girl.' This film leaves an unforgettable impression on the audience. I especially cannot forget the scenes of the Chinese People's Army fighting to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary regime. Before watching 'The White Haired Girl,' I had seen some documentaries about China in the cinema. From those films, I learned more about how the Chinese people are living today, how they are working and defending peace; and how great is the unity of the Chinese people united around the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. Film Week – this is an important tool for the Soviet people to fully understand the life of the Chinese people and further strengthen Soviet-Chinese friendship."
    Teachers Yushkin, accountant Remonov, and engineer Rokdev wrote in the criticism book:
    "Like all Soviet people, we have a strong and comprehensive interest in how the Chinese people are building their new life and new culture. Therefore, we hurried to watch the Chinese film 'The White Haired Girl' and some Chinese documentaries. It is very gratifying that young Chinese cinema has achieved such remarkable achievements in such a short period of time. This once again shows what great undertakings the Chinese people, who have shattered the shackles of enslavement and exploitation and are building a life beneficial to millions of laborers, are capable of accomplishing. We very much like the acting of the Chinese actors, especially Tian Hua and Zhang Shouwei, who played the main characters in the film. We congratulate the growing friendship between Soviet and Chinese film workers. Let our film workers and the film workers of the People's Republic of China create films that serve the cause of peace, democracy, and progress in great creative unity."
    Soviet people – workers, engineers, office workers, and students – write their opinions in this way. They see this film week as another clear proof of the ever-increasing friendship between the two great nations of the Soviet Union and China and the consolidation of Soviet-Chinese cultural ties.
    The interest in the Chinese Film Week is so great that cinemas are accepting requests from audiences, such as individual factories, institutions, and universities, to hold special screenings. Chinese films have "stepped out" of the walls of the cinema. They appear on the screens of clubs and cultural palaces. In addition to Moscow, Chinese Film Week is also being held simultaneously in twenty-nine other major cities in the Soviet Union.
    Chinese films, which are steadily achieving completely new creative victories, have become the wealth of a wide audience in the Soviet Union.

    莫斯科的中国电影周
    特列古波夫
    从十月一日起，苏联首都的各大电影院举行中华人民共和国电影周。
    莫斯科各电影院门前装饰着鲜明的广告画，上面写的是即将在电影周中向莫斯科人展览的各电影片名。在建筑物的顶上飘扬着中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的国旗。在许多电影院的观众休息室里，都举办了照片展览，这些展览表现了中国人民的劳动成就和文化成就，他们在最近曾庆祝具有重大意义的日子——中华人民共和国成立二周年。“突击队员”电影院观众休息室的照片展览的中间，有一块红色的横幅，上面写着伟大的斯大林给毛泽东同志的贺电中的话：
    “让中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的伟大友谊——远东和平及安全的坚强保障永远巩固。”
    斯大林的这句话，表达了致力于全面巩固与中国人民的牢不可破的友谊的苏联全体人民的思想和情感。苏联观众对中国电影作品所表现的那种特殊的兴趣是极其自然的。这种兴趣不仅表现在对于艺术片方面，并且也同样地表现在对于复写许多真实事件的纪录片方面，这些事件表现了中国人民在共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东的领导下在各个方面获得的成就。
    中华人民共和国电影周开幕四天以来，莫斯科所有放映中国影片的电影院的观众都极其踊跃。
    单是在“突击队员”、“艺术”和“莫斯科”三个电影院，就有五万五千人以上的观众看过了“白毛女”。单在放映中国纪录片的“白日新闻”一家电影院，四天来的观众就超过一万五千人以上。
    在每场电影放映以前，各电影院先举行专题报告：“中国人民和平建设的成就”和“苏、中两国人民永久的牢不可破的友谊是远东和平和安全的保障”。
    为这个电影周的举行而来到苏联的中国电影工作者代表团的团员们，受到到电影院去的莫斯科人们的热烈欢迎。
    观众看过电影之后，在批评簿上写出他们的意见。四天来，“艺术”电影院的批评簿上留下了好几十则观众的意见。
    学生马克西莫夫、米尼雅耶夫和马尔金写道： “我们以特别的注意看完了电影‘白毛女’，这个电影的真实的艺术性和戏剧的题材感动了人。看了受尽地主压迫的一切恐怖的农民儿女喜儿的命运，不感动是不可能的。当喜儿站进人民民主战士的行列里，为了同他们在一起达到自由的生活，为了消灭旧的地主、封建制度的时候，我们和全体观众都感到高兴。我们很喜欢这个片子里的音乐，特别是末尾的农民们唱的歌曲，这些农民欣喜愉快地唱歌，因为在中国的土地上再不会发生像电影里所演的喜儿一类的悲惨故事了。为了这部真实的好影片，我们感谢友爱的伟大的中国的电影工作者。”
    苏军军官伊凡·西加洛夫写道：“我们苏联人民永远是为进步的民主的艺术的任何一个成就而高兴的。这就是我们看到中国电影新片‘白毛女’之所以会如此愉快的原因。这个影片给观众留下一个不能遗忘的印象。我特别不能忘记中国人民军队为推翻国民党反动政权而进行的斗争的镜头。在我看‘白毛女’电影以前，我曾到电影院看过一些关于中国的纪录片。从那些影片里面，我更多地知道了中国人民今天是如何生活着的，如何劳动与保卫和平；知道了团结在共产党和毛泽东同志周围的中国人民的团结是如何的伟大。电影周——这是苏联人民全面地了解中国人民生活，和更进一步地加强苏中友好的重要工具。”
    教师尤什金、会计员惹蒙诺夫和工程师罗克杰夫在批评簿上写道：
    “我们和所有的苏联人民一样，对中国人民如何建设自己的新生活和新文化感到浓厚地和全面地兴趣。因此，我们赶忙观看了中国影片‘白毛女’和一些中国纪录片。年青的中国电影在这样短的时期达到了如此卓越的成就是很令人高兴的。这再一次地说明了，粉碎了奴役和剥削的锁链并建设着有利于千百万劳动者的生活的中国人民，能够作出怎样伟大的事业来。我们非常欢喜中国演员的演技，特别欢喜片中的主角田华和张守维。我们祝贺苏、中电影工作者的友谊日益加强。让我们的电影工作者和中华人民共和国的电影工作者在创作的大团结上，创制出为和平、民主和进步事业服务的影片来。”
    苏联人民——工人、工程师、职员和学生——都这样地写出他们的意见。他们把这个电影周看作为苏、中两大民族日益高涨的友谊和苏、中文化联系的巩固的又一明证。
    对于中国电影周的兴趣是如此广大，因之电影院接受观众的请求，如个别的工厂、机关和大学举行着特别放映。中国影片已经“跨出了”电影院的墙。它们出现在俱乐部和文化宫的银幕上。除莫斯科以外，苏联还有二十九个大城市同时举行中国电影周。
    稳步地达到完全新的创作的胜利的中国影片，已经成为广大的苏联观众的财富了。
