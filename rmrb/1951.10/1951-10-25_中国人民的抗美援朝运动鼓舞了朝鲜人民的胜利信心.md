The fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers have raised the sacred banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and have been participating in the just war against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people - the ferocious US aggressors - for a year now.

The entry into the war of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and their heroic fighting achievements have greatly inspired the Korean people's confidence in victory in the struggle against US aggression, strengthened and developed our fighting forces, and achieved brilliant victories. The joint operations of the heroic Korean and Chinese people's forces have inflicted heavy blows and shameful defeats on the US-British invading forces on all fronts. The victory achieved by the Korean and Chinese people in the Korean War against the US-British aggressors is not only a powerful guarantee for defending their own countries and preventing US imperialism from expanding its aggression in Asia, but also a great contribution to the cause of world peace and security.

The heroic Korean and Chinese people's forces, in order to accomplish this glorious and sacred mission, are displaying heroism and unwavering dedication unprecedented in human history.

After the US imperialists instigated the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to launch a war of aggression on June 25 last year, they planned to conquer the Korean people in one fell swoop with a quick battle and quick decision, destroy the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and turn Korea into a colony and a springboard for attacking the great Soviet Union and China. However, this delusion of the US imperialists was shattered by the heroic counterattack of our People's Army in the early stages of the war.

When the US aggressors faced a crisis of defeat, they mobilized their army, navy, air force and the armies of their vassal states in September of last year and invested them in the Korean battlefield, invading north of the 38th parallel. At that time, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement warning the US aggressors, saying: "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they sit idly by while the imperialists wantonly invade their neighbors." However, the US imperialists pushed their invading forces all the way to the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, invaded China's airspace, indiscriminately bombed Northeast China, killed Chinese people, destroyed Chinese people's property, and threatened China's security. This fact, like the behavior of the Japanese imperialists in the past, clearly proves that the US imperialists' aggressive aim is not merely to annex Korea, but to invade the entire Asia, and then dominate the world.

Because the survival of Korea and the safety of China are closely related, the Chinese democratic parties, headed by the Chinese Communist Party, issued a famous joint declaration, representing the unanimous demands and will of the 475 million people. The declaration pointed out: "Saving the neighbor is saving oneself, and to defend the motherland, we must support the Korean people. The people of the whole country are now widely and enthusiastically demanding to fight for the sacred task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country through voluntary action." At the same time, the slogan "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country" was put forward.

Indeed, the people of Korea and China have inseparable relations, whether historically or geographically. Since the Imjin War in which the Korean people opposed the Japanese aggressors more than 300 years ago, in the long-term common struggle against Japan and against the US-British imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the Korean and Chinese people have forged a strong combat friendship under the common goal and desire of striving for national freedom and happiness, and have become a good example of internationalist unity.

Precisely because of this, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, in order to defend the honor of the People's Republic of China and the freedom and rights of the people, all scrambled to ask to go to the Korean battlefield. Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao Zedong, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, armed with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and possessing steel-like conscious discipline and noble moral qualities in the revolutionary process, displayed a lofty spirit of dedication and bravery and an example of heroism on the Korean battlefield. They frustrated the enemy's offensive on the Korean battlefield and fundamentally reversed the war situation. In just two months after the Korean and Chinese people's forces launched a counteroffensive, they drove the enemy to the south bank of the Han River. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers braved the enemy's fierce firepower, the constant bombing of enemy planes and all other dangers, overcoming fatigue and difficulties, and bravely crossed mountains and ridges to continue their advance. In such a combat process, the Chinese People's Volunteers shed blood and sacrificed themselves, and their great and immortal achievements are simply too numerous to mention. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have achieved great victories in their joint operations over the past year. From the first day they entered the war in Korea a year ago, they have been loved and respected by all the Korean people. Their countless heroic deeds are even more admired by the Korean people. The glorious and great feats established by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, together with the feats of the Korean People's Army, will forever shine in the history of the Korean national liberation. The name of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the name of the Korean People's Army, will forever be remembered by our descendants. The fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers not only showed unparalleled heroism in combat, but also cared for the Korean people who had lost their parents, wives and children and were in a situation of hunger and cold everywhere due to the enemy's bombing and atrocities. They gave their own food and cotton clothes to the Korean people, and helped the people to chop firewood in the mountains and help the farmers to thresh grain. When the Korean people gave them things, they politely declined in every possible way. Although the language was not fluent, they were as affectionate as a family. Therefore, the Korean people praised the Chinese People's Volunteers as a truly just army and a truly close friend of the Korean people.

The combat unity and fraternal friendship between the Korean people and the Chinese people have been further strengthened. The Korean people's love and gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers is indescribable. They devote all their strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. They often write letters of thanks and consolation to the Chinese People's Volunteers. On August 1 this year, when celebrating the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Korean mothers wrote a letter to the Chinese People's Volunteers, which read: "We know that when you see this letter, you must be working with our sons and daughters to mercilessly eliminate the enemy and bravely advance in order to achieve the wishes of us old mothers." The Women's Alliance of Gude Township, Dingzhou County, North Pyongan Province, wrote in a letter of condolence to the Volunteers: "We must be fighters in the rear and strive not to fall behind our husbands and sons who are shedding blood and fighting on the front line."

The Chinese people, who sent their outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean battlefield, launched a vigorous movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in the vast territory of China. In order to assist the Korean people who had lost their homes due to the beastly bombing, destruction, looting and arson of the US aggressors, the Chinese people constantly sent large quantities of clothing, food and daily necessities, and sent many medical teams and repair teams to carry out medical treatment, transportation, road repair and other work. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the advanced Chinese working class widely launched a "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea" production competition in factories and mines, overfulfilling their production plans. The broad masses of Chinese peasants are victoriously carrying out land reform. They widely launched a struggle to increase agricultural production and pay public grain ahead of schedule, and scrambled to participate in the volunteer army or transportation teams and stretcher teams. Young students are actively engaged in the struggle against imperialist cultural aggression. Cultural workers use literary and artistic works and propaganda work to expose the atrocities of US imperialism. The industrial and commercial circles donated huge sums of money to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

Women replaced their husbands, brothers and sons in factories and rural areas, and achieved brilliant labor results. They wrote many sincere letters of condolence to the Korean women, and enthusiastically launched the work of rescuing Korean war orphans.

In August last year, the Chinese people sent a Chinese people's delegation headed by Comrades Guo Moruo and Li Lisan to Korea to express their condolences. In April of this year, they sent a Chinese people's delegation to Korea headed by Comrades Liao Chengzhi, Chen Yi and Tian Han to visit the front and rear of Korea to express their condolences to the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people. Their hard work has further inspired the Korean people's confidence in victory.

The 475 million Chinese people, closely united around the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, sent out the loud call of "Aid the Korean People" from every corner of the vast Chinese territory. This infinite and great strength is the most powerful guarantee that the Korean and Chinese people will eventually win the final victory in the war of resistance against the United States.

    中国人民的抗美援朝运动鼓舞了朝鲜人民的胜利信心
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长  朴正爱
    兄弟般的中国人民志愿军举起抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣旗帜，参加抗击朝中两国人民的共同敌人——凶恶的美国侵略军的正义战争已经一年了。
    中国人民的优秀儿女所组成的英雄的中国人民志愿军的入朝作战，和他们英勇的战斗业绩，大大鼓舞了朝鲜人民抗美斗争的胜利信心；加强和发展了我们的战斗力量，并取得了光辉的胜利。英雄的朝中人民部队的并肩作战，已使美英侵略军在各战线遭到沉重的打击与可耻的失败。朝中两国人民在反对美英侵略者的朝鲜战争中所获得的这种胜利，不但是保卫自己祖国与防止美帝国主义在亚洲扩大侵略的有力保障，而且对世界和平安全事业也是莫大的贡献。
    英雄的朝中人民部队，为了达成这一光荣而神圣的使命，发挥着人类史上罕有的英雄主义和刚毅的献身精神。
    美帝国主义者于去年六月二十五日指使李承晚匪帮发动了侵略战争后，就打算以速战速决的方法来一举征服朝鲜人民，破坏年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，变朝鲜为其殖民地及进攻伟大的苏联和中国的跳板。但是美帝国主义者的这个妄想，在战争初期就被我人民军的英勇的反攻所粉碎了。
    当美国侵略者面临失败危机时，它便于去年九月间动员了陆海空军及其仆从国家的军队，投入到朝鲜战场，侵犯到三八线以北。当时，中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来同志曾发表声明，警告美国侵略者说：“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。”但是美帝国主义者把它的侵略军一直推进到鸭绿江和图们江边，并侵犯了中国的领空，对东北进行滥炸，杀害了中国人民，破坏了中国人民的财产，威胁了中国的安全。这种事实和过去日本帝国主义者的行为一样，清楚地证明了美帝国主义者的侵略目的绝不仅仅在于吞并朝鲜，而是要侵略整个亚洲，进而称霸全世界。
    由于朝鲜的存亡和中国的安危有着密切的关联，所以，以中国共产党为首的中国各民主党派，代表四亿七千五百万人民的一致要求和意志，发表了有名的联合宣言。宣言中指出：“救邻即是自救，保卫祖国必须支援朝鲜人民。全国人民现已广泛地热烈地要求用志愿的行动为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。”同时，提出了“抗美援朝保家卫国”的口号。
    的确，朝中两国人民不论在历史上，或在地理上，都有着不可分离的关系。从距今三百多年前，朝鲜人民反对日本侵略者的壬辰战争以来，在长期的抗日共同斗争中和反对美英帝国主义者与蒋介石匪帮的斗争中，朝中两国人民在争取民族自由幸福的共同目的和愿望下，早已结下了坚强的战斗友谊，成为国际主义团结的好榜样。
    正因为如此，中国人民的优秀儿女在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，为了保卫中华人民共和国的荣誉和人民的自由权利，为了援助英勇斗争的朝鲜人民，都争先恐后地要求到朝鲜战场来。在光荣的中国共产党和伟大的毛泽东主席的领导下，以高度的爱国主义和国际主义思想武装起来，并在革命过程中具有了钢铁般的自觉纪律和高贵的道德品质的中国人民志愿军指战员们，在朝鲜战场上表现了崇高的献身和勇敢精神与英雄主义的榜样。他们在朝鲜战场上挫败了敌人的进攻，根本地扭转了战争的形势。在朝中人民部队举行反攻后仅仅两个月，就把敌人驱逐到汉江南岸去了。英雄的中国人民志愿军勇士们突破敌人的猛烈火力，冒着敌机不断的轰炸及其他一切危险，克服疲劳和困难，勇敢地翻山越岭继续前进。在这样的战斗过程中，中国人民志愿军英雄们流血牺牲，其伟大不朽的功绩，实在是不胜枚举的。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战一年来业已取得了伟大的胜利。从一年前他们入朝作战的头一天起，他们就受到了全朝鲜人民的热爱与尊敬。他们无数的英勇战斗事迹，更为朝鲜人民所惊叹与钦佩。英雄的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上所建立的光辉伟大的功勋，将和朝鲜人民军的功勋一起，永远光辉地留在朝鲜民族解放的历史上。英雄的中国人民志愿军的名字，也将和朝鲜人民军的名字一起，永远被我们的后代所铭记。兄弟般的中国人民志愿军不仅在战斗中表现了无比的英雄主义，而且到处爱护由于敌军的轰炸和暴行而失掉父母妻子处在饥寒交迫情况下的朝鲜人民。他们把自己吃的粮食和自己穿的棉衣送给朝鲜人民，并替人民到山上砍柴，帮助农民打场。当朝鲜人民送给他们东西时，他们却百般地婉言谢绝。言语虽然不通，但是彼此就像一家人一样地亲热。因此，朝鲜人民都赞扬中国人民志愿军真正是正义的军队，真正是朝鲜人民的亲密朋友。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民的战斗团结和兄弟般的友谊，进一步地加强了。朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军的热爱和感激是无法形容的。他们献出一切力量来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。他们经常给中国人民志愿军勇士们写感谢信和慰问信。今年八月一日在庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十四周年时，朝鲜的母亲们曾写信给中国人民志愿军，信中写道：“我们知道，当你们看到这封信时，你们一定是在和我们的子弟一起，为达成我们这些老母亲的愿望而无情地消灭敌人，勇敢地前进。”平安北道定州郡古德面妇女同盟给志愿军的慰问信中写道：“我们要做后方的斗士，争取不落于在前线流血斗争着的丈夫和儿女的后面。”
    把自己的优秀儿女送到朝鲜战场来的中国人民，在全中国广大的领土内轰轰烈烈地展开了抗美援朝运动。中国人民为了援助遭到美国侵略者野兽般的轰炸、破坏、掠夺、放火而丧失了家产的朝鲜人民，不断地送来了大批衣物、食粮和日用品，并派来了许多医疗队和修复队，进行医疗、运输、修路等工作。在中国共产党的领导下，先进的中国工人阶级，在工厂、矿山广泛地展开了“抗美援朝”生产竞赛运动，超额地完成着自己的生产计划。中国的广大农民胜利地进行着土地改革工作。他们广泛地展开了农产物的增产斗争和提前缴纳公粮的运动，并且争先恐后地要求参加志愿军或运输队、担架队。青年学生们积极地进行着反对帝国主义文化侵略的斗争。文化工作者以文艺作品和宣传工作等来揭露美帝国主义的暴行。工商业界为了抗美援朝而捐献了巨款。
    妇女们代替自己的丈夫兄弟和儿女在工厂、农村，取得了光辉的劳动成果。她们给朝鲜妇女写了许多真诚的慰问信，并热烈地展开了救护朝鲜战场难童的工作。
    去年八月间，中国人民曾派遣以郭沫若、李立三同志为首的中国人民代表团到朝鲜来进行慰问。今年四月间又派遣了以廖承志、陈沂、田汉同志为首的中国人民赴朝慰问团，来到朝鲜的前后方，慰问了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军以及朝鲜人民。他们的辛勤工作，更加鼓舞了朝鲜人民的胜利信心。
    紧紧地团结在伟大的毛泽东主席与中国共产党周围的四亿七千五百万中国人民，从广大中国领土的每一个角落里，发出了“援助朝鲜人民”的响亮呼声。这个无穷无尽的伟大力量，是朝中两国人民终将赢得抗美战争最后胜利的最有力的保障。（附图片）
