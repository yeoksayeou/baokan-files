    Remembering One Year of Combat Abroad on the Korean Front
    Zhu Huichun, Special Class Hero of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Looking back, it has been a year since we went abroad to fight. In this year, the deepest impression on me, and also the greatest education for me, is that I clearly realized and experienced how important it is to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.
    Last year, after crossing the Yalu River and arriving in Korea, everywhere I looked I saw corpses of Korean people murdered by the American bandits and killed by airplanes. It was impossible to find a single complete house in the cities and villages. Who could not feel resentment and sadness when seeing such a tragic situation? I hated it in my heart. I thought: American bandits, you are truly not human! One day you will know how powerful the Volunteer Army is.
    Soon, in a place called Jingbingting, we fought these murderous devils. That day, our unit was advancing towards Hengcheng on the highway, when suddenly a flare went up on the mountain to the left. Then, the enemy on the mountain fortress fired a heavy machine gun at our marching column. At that time, the company commander ordered the troops to move closer to the hillside. He simply looked at the terrain and thought: if we don't drive away the enemy on the mountain, it will directly threaten our unit's advance. Then, the company commander ordered our platoon to charge up from the rear of the mountain ridge. At this time, the platoon leader ordered our first squad to be the assault squad to capture this mountain. Our squad leader, Sun Yongfang, another soldier, Hong Mingwu, and I charged at the very front of the whole squad. Just as we approached the first mountain, the enemy ran away. When we charged to the second mountain, the enemy was scared away again. The three of us closely followed the enemy's rear end and chased after them to the third mountain. The enemy's heavy machine gun on the mountain was blocking our way forward. The three of us quickly avoided the enemy's blockade line and moved towards the mountain from a place with weaker fire. We got within twenty meters of the enemy, and they still hadn't noticed us. I raised my submachine gun and fired a burst, and one guy fell down. The other two ran down the mountain with their heads in their hands. At this time, the enemy on the highest peak noticed that we had occupied the mountain and concentrated their fierce artillery fire on us. After a burst of bombardment, our squad leader and Hong Mingwu were wounded. Of the three who charged up, only I was left. I thought at the time: no matter how you fight, I will charge up alone.
    The enemy had a squad defending the last mountain. I approached the enemy from a very concealed place, about fifteen meters away from them. My submachine gun fired another burst, and two American devils fell down immediately. The rest were running for their lives. I took advantage of this opportunity to charge up, and after chasing a few steps forward, two American devils came up from my left. I thought: if I don't strike first, I will suffer. I rushed forward and snatched the automatic rifle from one of the guys. That guy saw that things were not good and ran away in fright. Another devil saw that there was no one else around, only me, and rushed towards me, knocking me down. The snow on the ground was very slippery, and he and I rolled down the hillside for more than twenty meters. I mustered my strength and turned the enemy over. The enemy was big and strong, and I was tired enough from climbing several mountains. As I rolled with the enemy, I thought: no matter what, I must find a way to keep the enemy from running away. At this time, my face had been scratched by the enemy. I thought: today is a fight to the death, if I don't find a way to hold on to the enemy, I will be killed by the enemy. A thought flashed through my mind: tearing the enemy's mouth is a good way. I used my strength to insert my two hands into the enemy's mouth and tore his mouth to both sides. This guy couldn't stand being torn apart and let go to run. I didn't let go and kept tearing while shouting loudly to the troops below.
    In the end, this stubborn American soldier finally became our prisoner. After the battle, the comrades and superiors gave me a special commendation, and the superiors also gave me a title called "Invincible Hero." The Korean people also awarded me a medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—a Military Service Medal. To be honest, my contribution to the people of the motherland and the people of Korea is still not great. If it were not for the correct leadership of the Party, the wise command of the superiors, and the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland, how could I have made meritorious service, how could I have received glory? This glory should first be attributed to the great motherland and the people.
    Whenever the people of the motherland send us letters of condolence and comfort gifts, the hearts of every comrade in our Volunteer Army are stirred:
    "Look how concerned the people of the motherland are about us! If we don't fight well, how can we live up to the care and expectations of the people of the motherland?" Especially after this year's cotton-padded clothes were sent to the troops, every comrade was talking about it: "The people of the motherland have thought of everything for us: afraid that our clothes will be torn and we won't be able to mend them, they have prepared needles, thread, and cloth; afraid that we will get hurt in battle, they have prepared triangular bandages and first-aid kits; afraid that we will get lice on our bodies, they have even brought medicine to kill lice." The pockets are not empty, this clothes is new on all sides.
    The people of the motherland have donated airplanes, artillery, and tanks to us, which is a great encouragement to us. Take now, for example, the enemy's planes don't dare to be as crazy as they were before the Fourth Battle. In the past, the enemy's planes flew close to the hillsides and rooftops, strafing and bombing; now, they fly very high, and we suffer less. This is the result of the donation movement of the people of the motherland.
    Coming to Korea this year and seeing the suffering of the Korean people, it really makes my heart ache. The comrades talked together and said, "If we don't go abroad to fight, the people of the motherland will also suffer the same disasters as the Korean people." "We must not let the disasters of the Korean people fall on the people of the motherland." This is absolutely true. The Korean War clearly tells us that only by resisting America and aiding Korea can we have the security of our motherland.
    In the past year, our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have fought side by side and achieved great victories, beating the American imperialists bloody. We have already laid the foundation for our victory. Although the Korean War is a long and arduous struggle, we have the experience of fighting the American army for a year, the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland, and the help of the Korean people. We have the confidence and the certainty to eliminate the heinous American bandits who insist on aggression on the land of Korea.
    Elders of the motherland: I hope you can produce and build our great motherland with peace of mind, so that our motherland can grow faster. In the future, I am determined: to make greater achievements in safeguarding the security of the motherland, relieving the suffering of the Korean people, and safeguarding world peace.

### 在朝鲜前线回忆出国作战一周年

    为争取朝鲜反侵略战争的最后胜利而继续前进！
    在朝鲜前线回忆出国作战一周年
    中国人民志愿军某部特等功臣  朱惠春
    回想，出国作战已经一年啦。这一年来，给我印象最深的，也是对我教育最大的，就是我清楚地认识到和体验到了抗美援朝保家卫国是多么样的重要。
    去年，过了鸭绿江以后，一到朝鲜，到处都可以看到被美国强盗屠杀和被飞机炸死的朝鲜人民的尸首，城市和乡村根本就找不到一间完整的房子。谁看到这样悲惨的情形能不感到愤恨和难过呢？我心里恨极啦，我想：美国强盗，你们真不是人！有一天叫你们认识认识志愿军的厉害。
    不久，在净冰亭那个地方，我们和这些个杀人的魔鬼打起来啦。那一天，我们的部队正在公路上向横城前进，突然左边的山头打起了照明弹，接着山堡上的敌人就用一挺重机枪向我们行军的队伍打来。当时连长命令队伍先靠近山坡，他简单地看了
    一下地形，他想：假如不把山头的敌人赶走，就直接威胁我们部队的前进。随后连长命令我们一排从山梁后边往上冲。这时，排长叫我们一班当突击班，夺取这个山头。我和我们班长孙永芳，还有一个战士洪明武，三个人冲在全班最前头。刚刚接近第一个山头，敌人就跑啦。冲到第二个山头，敌人又吓跑了。我们三个人紧跟着敌人的后屁股往第三个山头追去。山头上敌人的一挺重机枪就咕咕咕地封锁着我们前进的道路。我们三个人迅速地躲开了敌人的封锁线，从火力稀薄的地方向山上摸。摸到离敌人只有二十多公尺了，敌人还没有发觉我们。我端起冲锋枪就是一梭子，一个家伙倒下啦，其余的两个抱头滚下山去。这时，最高峰的敌人发觉我们占领了山头，就集中了猛烈的炮火向我们打过来，一阵轰击，我们班长和洪明武负伤了。冲上来的三个人，只剩下我一个了。我当时想：不管你怎么样的打，我一个人也要往上冲。
    最后那个山头，敌人有一个班在固守着。我从很隐蔽的地方靠近了敌人，离敌人还有十五公尺那么远，我的冲锋枪又哒哒哒地叫了一梭子，当时就打倒了两个美国鬼子，剩下的都逃命啦。我趁着这个机会就冲上去，前追了几步，从我左面上来了两个美国鬼子，我心里想：不先下手就要吃亏。我一股劲扑上去，把一个家伙的自动步枪夺过来啦。那个家伙一看事不好，吓得转头就跑。另外一个鬼子，他看周围没有别人，只有我一个人，一个箭步就冲到我跟前，一下子就把我摔倒了。地上的雪滑得很，我和他滚下山坡有二十多公尺。我一鼓劲就把敌人翻过去啦。敌人个子大，力气也大，我爬了几个山头也够疲劳啦，我一边和敌人滚，我一边想着：不管怎么样，总想办法不叫敌人跑掉。这时我的脸已经被敌人抓破。我想：今天就是你死我活的斗争，不想办法搞住敌人，我就会被敌人搞死。我心里一打转：撕住敌人的嘴巴是个好办法。我一用劲，就把我的两只手插到敌人的嘴里，使劲把他的嘴巴往两边一撕。这个家伙被撕得受不住啦，松手想跑。我硬不撒手，一边使劲撕，一边使劲地喊下面的部队。
    最后，这个顽固的美国兵终于当了我们的俘虏。战后，同志们和上级给我评了一个特功，上级还送给我一个称号，叫“无敌英雄”，朝鲜人民还奖给我一枚朝鲜民主主义人民共和国勋章——军功章。说真的，我对祖国人民、对朝鲜人民的贡献还不大。要是没有党的正确领导、上级的英明指挥和祖国人民的热烈支援，我怎么能立功，我怎么能得到光荣呢？这个光荣，首先应该归功于伟大的祖国和人民。
    每当祖国人民给我们寄来慰问信和送来慰劳品的时候，我们志愿军每一个同志的心都在激动着：
    “你看，祖国的人民对我们多么关心哪！我们要不好好地打仗，怎么能对得起祖国人民的关怀和热望呢？”特别是今年的棉衣送到了部队以后，每一个同志都在念叨着：“祖国人民给我们想得太周到啦：怕我们衣服破了没法补，针、线、布都准备好啦；怕我们打仗挂了花，三角巾救急包都准备啦；怕我们身上生虱子，连杀虱子的药也装来啦。”兜兜不空，这衣服是三面新。
    祖国人民给我们捐献飞机、大炮和坦克，这对我们是一个很大的鼓舞。就拿现在来讲吧，敌人的飞机就不敢像第四次战役以前那样疯狂啦。以前的时候，敌人的飞机贴着山坡和房顶飞，扫射和轰炸；现在呢，它飞得可高啦，我们也少受气啦。这就是祖国人民搞捐献运动的结果。
    来到朝鲜这一年来，看到朝鲜人民的苦难，真使人心里发酸，同志们在一起谈起来就说：“不出国作战，祖国的人民也要遭受到像朝鲜人民一样的灾难。”“我们决不能让朝鲜人民的灾难，落到祖国人民的身上。”这话一点也不假，朝鲜战争清楚地告诉了我们，只有抗美援朝，才有祖国的安全。
    一年来，我们志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，获得了伟大的胜利，打得美帝国主义头破血流。我们已经奠定了我们胜利的基础。朝鲜战争，虽然是一场长期的艰苦的斗争，但是，我们有了一年来对美军作战的经验，有祖国人民的热烈支援和朝鲜人民的帮助，我们有信心，有把握，把坚持侵略的万恶的美国强盗消灭在朝鲜的土地上。
    祖国的父老们：希望你们安心地生产，建设我们伟大的祖国，让我们的祖国更快地成长起来。今后，我决心：为保卫祖国的安全，为解救朝鲜人民的苦难，为保卫世界的和平做出更大的成绩。
