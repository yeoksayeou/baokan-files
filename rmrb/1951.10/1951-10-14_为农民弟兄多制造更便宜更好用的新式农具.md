    Manufacture More Affordable and User-Friendly New Farm Tools for Our Farmer Brothers
    Li Zuoke, Engineer and Model Worker of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
    The grand North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition has opened. The significance of this conference is extremely important. It can not only promote material exchanges between urban and rural areas, between regions, and with foreign countries, dealing a powerful blow to the imperialist "economic blockade" against us, but it will also further promote the emotional exchange and love between our working class and our farmer brothers. The rich products from all over the country displayed at the conference will enable us to concretely and intimately recognize the greatness of the motherland; make us realize the diligence and wisdom of our working people; and make us feel how happy and glorious it is to live in such a great country!
    For nearly two years, in the course of my work in agricultural machinery, I have received tremendous education from our farmer brothers, both ideologically and technically. Let me give you an example! This spring, in order to meet the needs of farmers for deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, we designed two types of plows, a ten-inch walking plow and a nine-inch walking plow. At that time, I and a fellow worker took them to Handan Prefecture for testing, taking this opportunity to listen to the valuable opinions of our farmer brothers in order to improve them. On April 18th, we were introduced to Mutidi Village in Longwangmiao by the Agricultural Section of the Daming County Government. A village cadre saw us two uninvited guests and the two new types of walking plows that had never been seen before, and thought, "This thing is unlikely to be useful." He found us a piece of land to try it out, merely to complete a work task. On our way from Longwangmiao to Mutidi Village for the test, we saw a farmer from Mutidi Village plowing the land next to a highway. The village cadre asked the farmer to take off the old plow and replace it with the new plow to try it out. After plowing back and forth once, he said, "Hey, this thing is really good! Look, it plows deeper and wider than our plow, the livestock pulls it without getting tired, and it's light to hold." By this time, many people had gathered to watch the new plow plow the land. I casually said to the farmer plowing the land, "Try letting go of it." He let go, and the plow didn't fall or go crooked, but continued to plow very well, all the way from east to west. The onlookers clapped their hands in surprise. The farmer said to me, "Don't bother trying it anywhere else, just sell it to me. Even a child can hold this thing." The village cadre, hearing this, quietly said to me, "Okay, you've succeeded." I said, "Why?" He said, "He is one of the most conservative farmers in our village. If he welcomes your new plow, others will be no problem." Later, when we wanted to carry the plow to try it elsewhere, he said, "Don't carry it! I'll call for a cart." He insisted on finding us a cart and warmly invited us to his home for lunch. Such examples have given me endless courage in my work. No matter what the circumstances, as long as the farmers say "good" to the new farm tools, I forget all the hardship. That afternoon, the village cadre took us to plow a very hard threshing ground. We plowed it for him as well. They said, "Hey, if it were our old stuff, even ten plowshares would break." More and more people from the village came to watch. They also asked us to plow a cogongrass field. We went. At first, the plow was placed shallow, and it was pushed out of the ground by the cogongrass roots, making it impossible to plow. Later, it was placed more than one zha and two fingers deep, and then the plow went down, and we heard a crackling sound, turning up all the cogongrass, including the old roots. The owner of that piece of land was an old man, and he happily smiled and said, "If I had this plow earlier, this piece of land wouldn't have been left barren for three years. Our old stuff doesn't work, this land cannot be plowed." Another farmer picked up a bunch of green qingqingcai (prickly lettuce) from the ground and said to me, "You see, we have no way to get rid of this kind of grass. Its horizontal root is buried more than one zha deep. Our old plow can't plow that deep. Every time we plow, it's like shaving the head, the stalks on top are shaved off, and after a while, they grow out of the old roots below. Look, now your plow has even turned up these old roots, plowing so deep, how can we not harvest more grain?" This deepened my understanding of the plow even more. The people next to him said, "This thing really comes according to our wishes." The old man said, "Thanks to Chairman Mao, he is so thoughtful, he even thought of the plows for us to plow the fields!" Hearing these words, I deeply felt how glorious it is to work under the leadership of Chairman Mao!
    The farmers' reactions to the new farm tools are generally very good. For example, Liu Chou-chou of Dongshanghe, Lingchuan, Changzhi Prefecture, said, "New society, new atmosphere, new plows turn up new soil, a few more dan of grain will be harvested in the autumn, and there is a guarantee for resisting America and aiding Korea." The reactions from various places are that the new plows plow deep, have light traction, have a flat plow bottom, run steadily, can help prevent and control pests and reduce diseases, and produce more grain. For example, Xuan Lifu of Ningjiajie Village, Tai'an, divided two mu of land on a piece of land this year, one mu plowed with an old-style plow and one mu plowed with a new-style plow, planted millet. Each mu used one and a half jin of seeds and ten jin of soybean cake, weeding, etc., were all the same. After the seedlings grew, people who saw it said that the seedlings in the land plowed with the new-style plow grew well. Before the autumn harvest, he found that the millet had contracted white hair disease. However, millet with white hair disease accounted for 7% in the land plowed with the old-style plow, and only 1% in the land plowed with the new-style plow. Seedlings damaged by stem borers accounted for 3.3% in the land plowed with the old-style plow, and only 2.6% in the land plowed with the new-style plow. The yield per mu of the land plowed with the new-style plow was 172 jin, and the land plowed with the old-style plow only yielded 156 jin per mu. The land plowed with the new-style plow increased the yield by 16 jin per mu, which is 10.25%. In Zhangbei Heimahu Village, Chahar, buckwheat was planted this spring. The new-style plow can plow seven mu per day, while the old-style plow can only plow four mu. The new-style plow can produce 7.8% more buckwheat per mu. Mu Shenglixin in Mujiazhai, Wugong, Shaanxi, used new-style and old-style plows to plow land and grow cotton. The result was that the land plowed with the new-style plow yielded 17.5% more unginned cotton per mu. The corn planted by Jinghui Farm yielded 7.6% more per mu in the land plowed with the new-style plow. Because of this situation, farmers in various places who use new-style farm tools love new-style farm tools.
    In order to reduce the burden on our farmer brothers and enable them to widely obtain the new farm tools they like, all the staff and workers of our factory are using their brains, offering suggestions, and thinking of ways to "improve quality and reduce costs." Comrade Xu Zizheng came up with a method to recycle the waste grinding wheels for grinding plowshares, thereby saving the expense of purchasing small grinding wheels; Wang Mingshan improved the painting method of plow beams and plow handles, saving more than 35 million yuan per month; Zhou Dianqun used sawdust instead of barium carbonate as a carburizing agent for the teeth of weeding hoes, greatly saving the cost of hoe teeth. There are many such examples. The monthly output is also gradually increasing, thereby directly reducing the burden on farmers. Our inspectors will never allow any farm tools that do not meet the quality standards to leave the factory, thus ensuring that the farmers' farm tools are easy to use. Now the prices of all materials have risen compared to July last year, but our seven-inch walking plow has not only not increased in price, but the price per unit has also been reduced by 10,000 yuan. Now and in the future, we will continue to find all means to manufacture more affordable and user-friendly new farm tools to offer to our farmer brothers.

    为农民弟兄多制造更便宜更好用的新式农具
    华北农业机械总厂工程师劳动模范  李佐克
    盛大的华北区城乡物资交流展览会开幕了。这个大会的意义是十分重大的。它不仅可以推动各城乡间、各地区间和国内外的物资交流，对帝国主义对我们的“经济封锁”，是一个很有力的打击；而且将会更进一步地促进我们工人阶级和农民弟兄相互之间的感情交流和热爱。大会上所陈列的从各地来的丰富物产，将会使我们具体地亲切地认识到祖国的伟大；使我们认识到我们劳动人民的勤劳和智慧；使我们感觉到生活在这样伟大的国家里，是多么幸福，多么光荣！
    将近两年以来，在我从事农业机械工作的这段过程中，不论在思想上，或是技术上，都得到农民弟兄们给我的极大的教育。随便举一个例子吧！今年春天，为了满足农民深耕细作的需要，我们设计了十吋步犁和九吋步犁各一种，当时由我和一位工人同志带到邯郸专区去试验，借这个机会，听取农民弟兄们宝贵的意见，以便改进。四月十八日，我们由大名县政府农业科介绍到龙王庙的木堤村。一位村干部看见我们这两个不速之客和那两部从来没有见过的新式步犁，都觉得“这家伙不见得好用”，给我们找块地试一试，不过是完成一个工作任务而已。我们从龙王庙到木堤村去试验，在一条公路的旁边，看见木堤村的一个农民正在耕地。村干部让那个农民解下旧犁，换上新式犁试一试。他耕了一个来回，就说：“嘿，这家伙真得，你看耕的比咱这犁又深又宽，牲口拉着还不累，扶着还轻。”这时来看新式犁耕地的人，已经聚了很多。我顺便和那个耕地的农民说：“你撒开手试一试。”他撒了手，犁不倒也不歪，还是照样耕的很好，一直从东头耕到西头。看的人都惊喜地鼓起掌来了。那个农民对我说：“你甭到别处去试啦，你就卖给我吧，这玩意连小孩子都可以扶。”那位村干部听到这话，悄悄地对我说：“行啦，你成功啦。”我说：“为什么？”他说：“这是我们村里思想最保守的一个农民，他都欢迎你们这新式犁啦，旁人就甭说啦。”后来我们要扛着犁再到旁处去试，他又说：“你们甭扛啦！我来喊大车。”他坚持着给我们找了一辆大车，并且热烈地招待我们到他家里吃了午饭。这样的例子，使我在工作当中增加了无限的勇气。不论在任何情况下，只要农民对于新式农具说声好，我一切的苦都忘了。那天下午村干部又领我们去耕一块很硬的晒场，我们照样给他耕了起来。他们说：“嘿，这要是我们那旧家伙，有十个铧子也给崩啦。”村里看的人越来越多。他们又要求去耕一块茅根地。我们去了。最初犁放的浅，犁进地就被茅根顶出来了，没法耕。后来一下放到一楂零二指多深，于是犁下去了，直听得喀吧的响，把所有的茅草连老根都翻上来了。那块地的主人是个老头子，他高兴地笑着说：“我要是早有这犁，这块地不会让他荒了三年。咱那旧家伙不行，这地不能耕。”另外一个农民从地上捡起一串青青菜（刺菜）对我说：“你看，这种草我们是没有办法除净的，它的一根横根，扎在地下一楂多深，我们的旧犁犁不到，每次耕就好像剃头一样，上面的秆子剃掉了，过些时又从下面的老根上长出来了。你瞧，现在你们的犁连这老根都掀出来了，耕的又深，那里会不多打粮食？”这使我更加深了对于犁的认识。旁边的人又说：“这家伙真是可着咱的心眼儿来的。”那位老头说：“真亏毛主席，他老人家想的周到，连咱们耕地的犁都给想到啦。”我听了这话，深深地觉得在毛主席的领导下工作是何等光荣！
    农民们对于新式农具的反映一般都是很好的。譬如长治专区陵川东上河刘丑丑说：“新社会，新气象，新犁翻起新土壤，秋收多打几石粮，抗美援朝有保障。”各地的反映是新式犁耕的深，拉力轻，犁底平，走的稳，可以帮助防治害虫，减轻病害，多打粮食。譬如泰安宁家结村的玄立福，他今年在一块地上划出了二亩地，一亩用旧式犁耕，一亩用新式犁耕，种的是谷子。每亩都是下了一斤半种子，上了十斤豆饼，锄草等等都是一样，苗长出以后，看见的人都说新式犁耕的地里苗长的好，在秋收以前，他发现谷子得了白发病。不过得白发病的谷子在旧式犁耕的地里占百分之七，在新式犁耕的地里只占百分之一。在旧式犁耕的地里被钻心虫蛀坏的苗占百分之三点三，在新式犁耕的地里只有百分之二点六。新式犁耕的每亩产量是一百七十二斤，旧式犁耕的地每亩只打了一百五十六斤，新式犁耕地每亩增产十六斤，就是百分之十点二五。察哈尔张北黑麻湖村今年春天种莜麦，用新式犁每天可以耕七亩，用旧式犁只能耕四亩；用新式犁耕地每亩可以多打百分之七点八的莜麦。陕西武功穆家寨穆生力用新式犁和旧式犁耕地种棉花，结果是新式犁耕的地每亩多收皮花百分之十七点五。泾惠农场种的玉米，新式犁耕的地每亩多打百分之七点六。因为这种情形，所以各地使用新式农具的农民，都热爱新式农具。
    为了减轻农民弟兄的负担，使农民弟兄们能够广泛地获得他们所喜欢的新式农具，我们全厂职工都在为了“提高质量，减低成本”，开动脑筋，出主意，想办法。工人同志许子政想出了方法，使磨犁镜的废砂轮能够废物利用，因而节省了购买小砂轮的开支；王明善改良了犁辕犁把的油漆方法，每月可以节省三千五百多万元；周殿群用锯末代替炭酸钡，作为耘锄锄齿的渗炭剂，大大地节省了锄齿的成本。这样的事迹很多。每月的产量，也逐渐增高，因而直接地减轻了农民的负担。我们的检验员绝不让一件不够质量的农具出厂，因而保证农民的农具好用。现在一切的材料，和去年七月比较，都涨了价，而我们的七吋步犁不但没有涨价，而且每部价格还减少了一万元。现在和今后，我们还要想出一切办法，来制造更便宜更好用的新式农具，献给我们的农民弟兄们。
