To Commander Peng Dehuai and All Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Comrades:

    Today, as the people of the whole country warmly celebrate the first anniversary of your—the most outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland—going abroad to fight, we, the various democratic parties and democratic人士, extend our most sincere respects to you with boundless excitement and gratitude.

    In the past year, you have fought bravely shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, annihilating a large number of enemies, severely打击the American invading army and its accomplices, and made immortal contributions to the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. You are not only the most loyal defenders of the Chinese people, but also great warriors in safeguarding Asian and world peace. Your indomitable fighting spirit fully embodies the fine qualities of the Chinese working people.

    The US imperialists' evil conspiracy to invade Korea and then invade mainland China has obviously fallen into irreparable failure; but it has no intention of repenting. It is still taking advantage of the interval in the ceasefire negotiations to recklessly invade; it is still colluding with Japanese militarists, attempting to expand the war of aggression; it is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, infringing on our airspace, and threatening our security. We firmly believe that our heroic Volunteer Army will be able to carry forward the spirit of patriotism and internationalism and continue to fight bravely to kill the enemy. If the invaders do not accept peace, resolutely give them a greater blow! We, the people of the whole country in the rear, must further popularize and deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, step up production, saving, and the movement to donate weapons, do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and unite all forces to support you.

    Justice is on our side, on the side of the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world. We are growing stronger in the battle, and victory will surely belong to us!

    Long live the heroic and invincible Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Long live the unity of the Chinese and Korean people!
    Long live the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle in Asia and the world!
    Long live our great motherland, the great Chinese Communist Party, and the great leader Chairman Mao!

    各民主党派及无党派民主人士
    致中国人民志愿军的贺电中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员暨全体指挥员战斗员同志们：
    当全国人民热烈庆祝你们——祖国最优秀的儿女——出国作战一周年的今天，我们各民主党派及民主人士谨以无限兴奋和感激的心情，向你们致最崇高的敬礼。
    一年以来，你们和朝鲜人民军英勇地并肩作战，歼灭了大量的敌人，严重地打击了美国侵略军及其帮凶们，为中、朝人民与全世界人民立下了永远不可磨灭的大功劳。你们不但是中国人民最忠诚的保卫者，也是维护亚洲和平与世界和平的伟大战士。你们不屈不挠的作战精神，充分地发扬了中国劳动人民的优良品质。
    美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜，妄想进而侵略中国大陆的罪恶阴谋，显然已陷于无可挽救的失败；但它丝毫没有悔祸之心，它还在利用停战谈判的间隙，狂妄进犯；还在勾结日本军国主义分子，企图扩大侵略战争；还在霸占我国领土台湾，侵犯我国的领空，威胁我国的安全。我们坚决信赖我们英勇的志愿军必能发挥爱国主义和国际主义的精神，再接再厉地奋勇杀敌。侵略者如不接受和平，就坚决地给以更大的打击！我们后方的全国人民，一定更加普及而深入地加强抗美援朝运动，加紧生产、节约、捐献武器运动，做好优待烈属和军属的工作，团结一切力量支援你们。
    正义是在我们方面，是在中、朝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民方面。我们在战斗中更加壮大起来了，胜利一定属于我们！
    英勇无敌的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中朝人民团结万岁！
    全亚洲全世界的反帝国主义斗争胜利万岁！
    我们伟大的祖国、伟大的中国共产党、伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
