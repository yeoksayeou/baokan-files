    Cadres of Cooperatives in Xinmin and Kaiyuan Counties Bravely Rescue Materials During Flood
    To the Editor:
    During the floods in Xinmin and Kaiyuan counties, Northeast China, many outstanding cooperative cadres emerged. On August 15th, when the floodwaters in Xinmin County rose sharply, Guo, the director of the Ci’ergangzi Cooperative, and comrade Ma Baolin, in order to prevent the members' property from suffering losses, rescued all 4,350 jin of wheat stored in the cooperative to a high ground within more than an hour. When the water inside the house was four feet deep, Director Guo was still rescuing materials. Others told him to come out quickly, but he ignored them. Finally, someone pulled him out, and the house collapsed a dozen minutes later. When Wang Jiasheng, a comrade from the Zhangshitai Cooperative in the Third District of Xinmin, was rescuing materials in the cooperative, his family's yard was also flooded. His family asked him to go back to rescue things, but he said, "Every piece of the cooperative's property is more important than my own. I serve the people and must be worthy of the people." At this time, his house was washed down, and even the three fat pigs he raised were washed away. Due to their selfless and courageous rescue efforts, the cooperative's property was preserved. Similarly, when the west wall of the Shangyangbao Cooperative in Kaiyuan was breached by the flood, the cadres climbed onto the roof and held their ground. When a rescue boat came to ask them to board, they said, "If we don't protect the cooperative, we will be letting the members down. We cannot leave here now, we will rescue as much as we can."

    Although the situation was very difficult, the cooperative cadres persisted in their business. During the flood, the disaster victims in Changgouyan, Xinmin, had no food supply and had to eat rotten corn soaked in the fields. The cooperative organized three small wooden boats to purchase and transport sorghum rice, matting for building shelters, matches, salt, and other daily necessities from Xinmin County, solving the difficulties of the disaster victims. Because they wholeheartedly served the masses, the prestige of the cooperative was greatly enhanced.

    新民开原两县合作社干部洪水期间奋不顾身抢救物资编辑同志：
    东北新民、开原两县发生水灾期间，涌现出很多优秀的合作社干部。八月十五日新民县洪水猛涨时，茨?岗子合作社郭主任和马宝林两同志，为了不使社员财产遭受损失，在一个多钟头内就将社内存的小麦四千三百五十斤全部抢救到土岗上。到屋内的水有四尺深时，郭主任还在向外抢救物资。别人叫他赶快出来，他没理会，最后有人把他拉了出来，十几分钟后房子就倒塌了。新民三区章士台合作社王家相同志在抢救社内物资时，他家的院子也进了水，家里人叫他回去抢救东西，他说：“合作社的财产那一件都比自己的重要，我是为人民服务的，一定要对得起人民。”这时他家里的房子被冲倒，连养的三口肥猪都给冲走了。由于他们忘我地奋不顾身地抢救，合作社的财产得以保全。又如开原尚阳堡合作社西墙被冲开，干部们爬到房上坚守，救生船来叫他们上船，他们说：“不把合作社保全好，就对不起社员了，现在我们不能离开这里，能抢救多少是多少。”
    虽然情况十分困难，合作社干部还坚持自己的业务。在涨水中新民长沟沿的灾民因粮食接济不上，只得吃在地里被水泡臭的苞米。合作社就组织了三只小木船到新民县城内购运高粱米、搭棚用的席子、火柴、食盐等生活必需品，解决了灾民困难。由于他们全心全意为群众服务，使合作社的威信大大提高。
