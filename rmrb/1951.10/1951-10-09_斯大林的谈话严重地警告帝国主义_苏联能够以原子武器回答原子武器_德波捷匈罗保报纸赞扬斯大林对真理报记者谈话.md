Xinhua News Agency, 8th. According to TASS: Newspapers in Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria all prominently published Stalin's answers to questions from a *Pravda* reporter regarding the issue of atomic weapons on the 7th, and successively published articles commenting on it.

    The German Socialist Unity Party's central organ, *Neues Deutschland*, published an article titled "Stalin Points Out the Road," which said: "The leader of the great Soviet people has declared in simple and clear terms: the United States' monopoly on the atomic bomb no longer exists. For the warmongers, this means: it is best to wake up and agree to effectively ban atomic weapons; for people all over the world who long for peace, this means: the Soviet Union, which is with us, has become increasingly strong, and the possibility of defending life has increased as never before. The people of the world will understand this meaning and act accordingly. The young German Democratic Republic is standing tall and moving forward more firmly on the only correct path guided by Stalin."

    The Polish United Workers' Party's organ, *Trybuna Ludu*, published an editorial saying: "Stalin's speech once again illustrates to world public opinion what an invincible country the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace, is, and that the strength of the anti-imperialist camp far exceeds that of the war camp. At the same time, Stalin's interview with reporters also clearly shows the world the Soviet Union's attitude: the Soviet Union hopes for peace, but if the aggressors launch a war, the Soviet Union is fully prepared to deal with them. This attitude issues a warning to the imperialists and encourages progressive humanity around the world, prompting them to fight for peace."

    The Czechoslovak Communist Party's organ, *Rudé Právo*, published an editorial titled "The Invincible Cause of Peace," saying: "The great Stalin's interview with a *Pravda* reporter confirms that the cause of peace is invincible. Until now, the imperialists have built their hegemonic plans on the atomic monopolists. They harbor illusions about the atomic bomb, thinking that the atomic bomb can save future aggressors from Hitler's shameful fate. However, Stalin's speech shattered this illusion and is of immeasurable importance to the cause of peace."

    The Hungarian Working People's Party's organ, *Szabad Nép*, published an editorial saying: "Stalin's speech seriously warns the imperialists. If the American imperialists were not afraid of the strength of the Soviet Union, they would have realized their world war plan long ago. The imperialists must consider again and again: the Soviet people are able to deal with the imperialists' weapons with their own weapons. They should remember the lessons of the Second World War, which proved that the Soviet people can use their own weapons to inflict greater blows on the aggressors and knock down the weapons in the hands of the imperialist aggressors."

    The Romanian Workers' Party's organ, *Scînteia*, published an editorial titled "Stalin Shows the Will of the People of All Countries," saying: "The working people of the world are extremely gratified to hear Stalin's words and believe that they have great hope. They fully understand that Soviet science and mechanical engineering are the most advanced in the world, and there is nothing to hinder their development. The Soviet Union can at any time answer atomic weapons with atomic weapons." The editorial continued: "Stalin's speech has aroused widespread resonance around the world and has finally exposed the warmongers, making them increasingly isolated among the people. For the Romanian people, Stalin's words are a happy message, instilling in them confidence in a happy future and encouraging them to further strive for peace and socialism."

    Bulgaria's *Otechestven Front* published an editorial saying: "With iron logic and clarity, Stalin exposed the two-faced policy of the American and British imperialists who want to ensure their monopoly on the production of atomic weapons under the guise of atomic weapons control." *Trud*'s editorial said: "The world has repeatedly received evidence of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. The Soviet Union has proved in the past and now proves with its actions that its abundant material and human resources are used for socialist construction and have no intention of carrying out aggressive wars against any country."

    斯大林的谈话严重地警告帝国主义
    苏联能够以原子武器回答原子武器
    德波捷匈罗保报纸赞扬斯大林对真理报记者谈话
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社消息：德、波、捷、匈、罗、保六国报纸，都在七日以显著地位刊载了斯大林关于原子武器问题的答真理报记者问，并纷纷著文予以评论。
    德国统一社会党中央机关报“新德意志报”发表题为“斯大林指出了道路”的文章说：“伟大的苏联人民的领袖以简单明确的辞句宣布说：美国对于原子弹的垄断已不复存在了。对于战争贩子们，这就是说：最好是清醒过来，同意有效地禁止原子武器；对于全世界渴望和平的人们，这就是说：和我们在一起的苏联已日益强大，保卫生命的可能性已空前增大了。全世界人民将会了解这种意义而行动起来。年轻的德意志民主共和国正在挺起胸膛，更加坚定地在斯大林指引的唯一正确的道路上前进。”
    波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”发表社论说：“斯大林的谈话再次向世界舆论说明，世界和平的堡垒苏联是一个多么不可战胜的国家，反帝国主义阵营的力量大大地超过了战争阵营的力量。同时，斯大林的答记者问也向全世界明确地表明了苏联的态度：苏联是希望和平的，但是如果侵略者发动战争，苏联有充分的准备来对付他们。这种态度对帝国主义者提出了警告，并且鼓舞了全世界进步人类，推动他们为和平而斗争。”
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报“红色权利报”以“不可战胜的和平事业”为题发表社论说：“伟大的斯大林对真理报记者的谈话，证实了和平事业是不可战胜的。到现在为止，帝国主义者曾把他们的称霸计划建筑在原子垄断者上面。他们对原子弹抱着幻想，以为原子弹可以挽救未来的侵略者免于希特勒的可耻的结局。但是，斯大林的谈话打破了这种幻想，而对和平事业有着不可计量的重要性。”
    匈牙利劳动人民党机关报“自由人民报”发表社论说：“斯大林的谈话严重地警告了帝国主义者。美帝国主义者如果不是畏惧苏联的力量，老早就已实现他们的世界战争的计划了。帝国主义必须再三考虑：苏联人民是能够以自己的武器来对付帝国主义者的武器的。他们应该记取第二次世界大战的教训，那次大战曾证明苏联人民能够以自己的武器给侵略者以更大的打击，并且击落帝国主义侵略者手中的武器。”
    罗马尼亚工人党机关报“火花报”以“斯大林表明了世界各国人民的意志”为题发表社论说：“全世界劳动人民听了斯大林的话都极感欣慰，并且认为他们有了巨大的希望。他们充分了解：苏联的科学和机械工程都是世界上最先进的，而且没有任何东西阻碍它们的发展。苏联能够在任何时候以原子武器回答原子武器。”社论接着说：“斯大林的谈话在全世界引起了普遍的共鸣，并使战争贩子们最后暴露了原形，在人民中间越发陷于孤立。对于罗马尼亚人民来说，斯大林的话是一个喜信，为他们注入了对幸福的将来的信心，鼓舞着他们为争取和平和社会主义而进一步奋斗。”
    保加利亚“祖国阵线报”发表社论说：“斯大林以铁的逻辑和明确性，揭露了要在原子武器管制的伪装下确保自己垄断原子武器生产的美英帝国主义者的两面政策。”“劳动报”的社论说：“全世界曾屡次得到苏联和平政策的证据。苏联过去和现在都用它的行动证明：它的丰富的物力和人力都是用于社会主义建设，无意对任何国家进行侵略战争。”
