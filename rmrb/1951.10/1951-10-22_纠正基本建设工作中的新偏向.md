Correcting New Deviations in Basic Construction Work
Zhang Chengyuan, China Grain Company, Southern Jiangsu Branch

The People's Daily editorial "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design" not only pointed out the correct direction for the current basic construction work but also clarified the confused thinking of some cadres responsible for basic construction. From top to bottom, many people have a clear and affirmative understanding of this basic principle and have begun to implement it in practical work. The first and second examples introduced by Comrade Cui Zhong in his article "Further Develop the Discussion on Basic Construction" on October 7, and the main experiences of the Huai River project mentioned by Comrade Zeng Xisheng in "The Achievements and Main Experiences of the 1951 Huai River Project" on September 24, also show that the success of the first phase of the Huai River project is inseparable from "having engineering plans and technical designs before construction."

The various serious problems existing in basic construction that have been repeatedly exposed by the People's Daily and local newspapers have aroused the attention of the cadres responsible for this work. Many people (including many well-known experts) have conducted in-depth self-examinations in their thinking and work, launched enthusiastic discussions, and measured and tested their degree of responsibility to the people in the new society. The results of the self-examinations and discussions have improved basic construction work and have also advanced themselves. Some senior technical personnel frankly said that in the past, designs relied only on narrow personal experience, but today they know that they must rely on the working class; therefore, they personally go deep into the field to investigate and study, which is good. However, some technical personnel, after seeing the serious facts and strict criticisms in the newspaper, did not face the problem with the correct attitude but produced new deviations.

These new deviations have also been raised in the People's Daily. I think the most serious is the fear of criticism and the fear of responsibility. I once heard someone say: "Only criticism, no praise; only bad examples, no good models; more blows, less encouragement; it really makes people afraid to continue." Some people also said: "It's really difficult to do engineering now. You can only do well, not badly. I feel chilled by the repeated criticisms in the People's Daily." The specific manifestations of this kind of thinking are as follows:

First, pushing responsibility. Lower levels push to higher levels, higher levels push to lower levels, designers push to constructors, and constructors push to designers. For example, a simple warehouse is planned to be built in a certain place, but the design below does not conform to the principles and the standards are very high, even exceeding the permanent warehouse allocated with construction funds. The designer said to the superior: "Where do you think is good to reduce? Reduce the partitions, or change the brick walls to bamboo lath mud walls? You approve it, anyway, we will do it according to your approval. If the floor sinks or the house collapses in the future, then the person who approved the reduction will be responsible." Between design and construction, the designer believes that his design is perfect. If problems occur in the building in the future, it is the result of poor construction. An design engineer inspected a workshop and found that the wooden pillars were relatively bent, so he said:
    "Our design is based on completely straight wood without bending. Now that you are using such bent wooden pillars, if problems occur, it is the responsibility of the construction." This design engineer did not think that it is difficult for fir wood to be completely straight. It is wrong not to start from reality and not to carefully estimate this point in the design, but to say that the constructors' selection of materials is improper. However, some construction personnel mechanically execute the drawings and do not raise any opinions, thinking that as long as they follow the drawings, if the house collapses, the designer will be responsible. This method of you pushing me and me pushing you will eventually harm the people's cause.

The second is not daring to create and sticking to conventions. Some people are studying the design of connecting small wood materials to form a large-span roof truss, which may be possible in theory, but lacks experience. Therefore, the supervising engineer feels that it is "trying to be different" and lets them do it according to the old way. They believe that if a new method goes wrong, they will be criticized; but sticking to conventions is reliable, and there is a complete set of experience, so there will be no major problems. They believe that this is a steady and cautious approach, being cautious and responsible for the work; otherwise, it is adventurism and rash action. However, he did not think that this approach would stifle others' inventions and hinder active creation, which is another manifestation of conservative thinking.

The third is that they think careful design is to use large materials, increase the safety factor, calculate the wind force as large, and reduce the safe bearing capacity of the soil. As a result, the original five-inch purlin is now changed to six inches; wood piles are added where they are not needed, or more piles are added. They think this way: if the house collapses, they will be criticized and punished, using large materials is for sturdiness, anyway, the materials are used in the project, they believe that this is careful and safe design. In fact, this kind of thinking of "fear of instability and fear of collapse" not only wastes materials, but sometimes cannot achieve the purpose of safety. If the purlin is enlarged and the roof panel is thickened, the load on the roof truss will also increase. If some links are not enlarged, problems will occur. This is an extremely undesirable way of thinking; especially today, when building materials are quite scarce, it is a very serious mistake to use large materials casually. Careful design is neither adventurous nor conservative, but just right. All unscientific and uneconomical calculation methods must be opposed.

The fourth is to delay time and change plans. Some technical personnel extend the design time indefinitely and change the plan again and again. They think that this is careful consideration and thorough research. Today, they negate yesterday's calculation method, and tomorrow they overturn today's plan. As a result, they doubt all reliable old formulas and old methods, and they delay making a decision, so work cannot be started. They also say that careful design depends on the length of time. This is also an irresponsible and wrong idea to the people.

The formation of these erroneous ideas mostly stems from the fear of responsibility and the fear of criticism. Tracing the root cause, the main reason is that they have not established the idea of truly serving the people and have not stood firmly on the position that an engineer should have who serves the people. I think that technical personnel must strengthen their political study, dare to accept criticism, and dare to take responsibility. All negative and fearful thoughts must be thoroughly eradicated. Engineering design is a complex organizational and technical work. In order to do a good job in basic construction, in addition to inspecting basic construction projects, I believe that every responsible cadre and technical personnel should further conduct in-depth and specific inspections of their thinking and work attitudes, wage a struggle against the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, and strengthen their sense of responsibility to the people's cause, so as to make our basic construction work more effectively improved.

### 纠正基本建设工作中的新偏向

    纠正基本建设工作中的新偏向
    中国粮食公司  苏南区分公司  张诚沅
    人民日报“没有工程设计就不可能施工”的社论，不但给目前正在进行的基本建设工作指出了正确的方向，同时也澄清了若干负责基本建设的干部的混乱思想。从上到下，许多人都对这个基本原则有了明确的、肯定的认识，而且开始贯彻到实际工作中去。十月七日崔中同志“进一步开展对基本建设的讨论”一文中所介绍的第一与第二个例子，和九月二十四日曾希圣同志在“一九五一年治淮工程的成就及其主要经验”中所谈到的治淮工程的主要经验，也能看出第一期的治淮工程的成功，与“先有工程计划、技术设计，而后施工”是分不开的。
    人民日报与各地报纸一再揭发的基本建设中所存在的各种严重问题，已引起负责这项工作的干部们的重视。很多人（包括许多有名望的专家）从思想上到工作上，都进行了深刻地检查，展开了热烈地讨论，衡量与考验自己在新社会中，对人民负责的程度。检查与讨论的结果，使基本建设工作有了提高，也使自己有了进步。某些高级技术人员坦白地说，过去的设计，只凭个人狭隘的经验，而今天知道了必须依靠工人阶级；因而亲自深入现场，调查研究，这是好的。但是有一部分技术人员，看到报上那种严重的事实，严格的批评以后，却不用正确的态度来正视这个问题，而产生了新的偏差。
    这种新的偏差在人民日报上也已提出过。我觉得其中最严重的是怕批评、怕负责的思想。曾经听人说过：“只见批评，不见表扬，只有坏的例子，没有好的典型，打击多、鼓励少，叫人实在不敢搞下去。”也有人这样说：“现在的工程真难搞，只准做好，不准做坏，我见到人民日报一再的批评，感到寒心。”这种思想的具体表现有下列几方面：
    第一，是推。下级向上级推，上级向下级推，设计者推施工者，施工者推设计者。譬如，某处计划建筑简易仓库，下面设计的不合原则，标准很高，竟超过了分配建筑费额的永久性仓库。设计者对上级说：“你说那里好减？把櫊栅减小，还是把砖墙改成竹笆灰泥墙，你核下来好了，反正我们照办。将来如果地板下陷，房子倒了，那由核减的人负责。”在设计与施工之间，设计者认为自己的设计是完善的，如果建筑物将来发生问题，那是施工不善的结果。有位设计者检查工场，发现木柱较弯，就说：
    “我们设计时，是以完全平直无弯曲的木料为准的，现在你们用了这样弯的木柱，那么如发生问题，是施工的责任。”这位设计工程师就没有想到杉木要完全平直是很困难的。在设计时，不从实际出发，不周密地估计到这一点，反说施工者选料不妥，这是不对的。但也有负责施工者机械执行图样，有意见也不提出，认为只要照图样做，房子倒了，总要由设计者负责。这种你推我，我推你的办法，结果会使人民事业吃了亏。
    第二是不敢创造，墨守成法。有人研究用小木料连接设计跨度很大的屋架，这在理论上或者可能，但是缺乏经验。因此，主管工程师就觉得是“标新立异”，让照着过去的一套做。他们认为，新的办法出了毛病，就要受批评；而墨守成法是可靠的，有了成套的经验，出不了什么大毛病。他们认为这是稳扎稳打，对工作慎重负责，否则就是冒险主义，轻举妄动。然而，他就没有想到这种作法，打击了他人的发明，阻碍了积极创造就是保守思想的另一种表现。
    第三是认为周密设计就是要用大材料，把安全率加大，把风力算大，把土壤的安全承重缩小。这样作的结果，原来用五吋的桁条已足够的，现在要改用六吋的；可以不打木桩的，要加打木桩，或者多打几根。他们这样想：房子倒了要受批评，要受处分，用大料子是为坚固，反正材料是用在工程上面，他们认为这样才是设计周密、安全。其实，这种“惟恐不牢，只怕要倒”的思想，不但浪费材料，而且有时候反不能达到安全的目的。桁条用大了，屋面板用厚了，屋架的负担也加重了，假若有的环节没有加大，就会发生问题。这是一种极其要不得的思想；尤其在今天建筑材料相当缺乏，随便用大料，实在是极严重的错误。周密的设计是不冒险也不保守，恰到好处。一切不科学、不经济的计算方式必须反对。
    第四是拖延时间，变更计划。有些技术人员把设计时间无原则地延长再延长，将计划变了再变。他们认为这就是慎重考虑与周密研究。今天否定了昨天的计算方法，明天又推翻今天的计划，结果是对一切可靠的旧公式、旧方法都怀疑，迟迟不作决定，工作无法下手，还说设计周密决定于时间长久。这同样是对人民不负责的一种错误想法。
    这几种错误思想的形成，大半是从怕负责、怕批评出发的。追查根源，主要的是因为没有树立起真正为人民服务的思想，没有站稳人民工程师应有的立场。我觉得技术人员必须加强政治学习，勇于接受批评，勇于负责，一切消极与害怕的思想，必须要彻底铲除。工程设计是一件复杂的组织工作与技术工作，为了要搞好基本建设，我的意见，除了对基本建设工程进行检查外，每一个负责干部和技术人员，都应该更进一步地从思想上、工作态度上，进行深入、具体的检查与以上几种错误思想展开斗争，加强对人民事业的责任心，以便使我们的基本建设工作得到更有效地提高与改进。
