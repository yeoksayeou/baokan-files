    ▲ People's Governments at all levels in Jiangxi Province are earnestly supervising the implementation of contracts and agreements for the exchange of local products between Jiangxi Province and other regions. As of the end of August, most of the contracts and agreements that had expired throughout the province had been delivered according to the stipulated time limit in the contract; the total value of deliveries accounted for 82.8 percent of the total value of all expired transaction contracts.
    ▲ The production of handmade paper and pulp in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces has seen significant development this year. It is estimated that the output of handmade paper in Hunan this year will increase by 63 percent compared with last year, and the pulp output in Jiangxi will exceed the planned target by two and a half times. The paper and pulp produced in the two provinces, in addition to supplying the needs of the Central South region, also supplies part of the pulp needed by paper mills in East China.
    ▲ The cooperative societies in Southern Anhui District have developed greatly. There are currently 423 grassroots cooperative societies in the district, with more than 1,553,000 members. The number of members has reached 38 percent of the total population of the district, and in some areas with cash crops, the cooperative members account for about half of the local population.
    The development of cooperative societies in Southern Anhui District has vigorously promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. From January to August this year, the cooperative societies in Southern Anhui District marketed surplus agricultural products and local and special products for farmers with a total value of more than 140 billion yuan. Based on the 3.5 million agricultural population in the district, the cooperative societies sold an average of 40,000 yuan worth of products for each farmer, greatly increasing the purchasing power of the farmers. During the same period, the cooperative societies supplied farmers with various living and production materials worth more than 110 billion yuan on behalf of the state-owned trading companies.
    ▲ In order to improve the lives of people of all ethnic groups, the People's Government of Ningxia Province is organizing 30,000 camels to transport salt from the Jilantai and Chahan salt lakes. The total amount of this transportation is 1 million dan (1 dan = 50 kg), which is about two and a half times the amount of salt sold outside Ningxia Province last year. The terminal stations for the transportation are Dengkou and Zhongwei; from here, the salt can be transported to Suiyuan, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces by both water and land routes. After the completion of the transportation task of 1 million dan, the Hui, Han, and Mongolian people of the province will increase their wealth by more than 38 billion yuan.
