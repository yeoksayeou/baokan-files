The Chinese people are celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with hope and confidence.

Two years ago, the founding of the People's Republic of China ended the criminal rule of imperialism and Chinese reactionaries. The imperialists, primarily the US imperialists, who had always relied on sucking the blood of the Chinese people to enrich themselves, once妄 thought that the foundation of the People's Republic of China was unstable, and they were determined to destroy it by means of military aggression, economic blockade, and special agent sabotage. But historical facts have completely shattered the dreams of the imperialists. In the past two years, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories and achievements, whether in the struggle to resist foreign aggressors, in the struggle to eliminate the remaining forces of domestic counter-revolutionaries, or in the struggle to restore and build the people's economic and cultural and educational undertakings. The People's Republic of China has not only not been destroyed or weakened, but has become increasingly consolidated and stronger.

The People's Republic of China was founded in the struggle against the rule of imperialism and its running dogs, and most of its first two years were still spent in the struggle against imperialist aggression.

Unwilling to accept its failure in China, US imperialism, more than a year ago, in June of last year, crossed the Pacific Ocean of more than 8,000 kilometers and launched an armed invasion of our friendly neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, while sending naval and air forces to invade and occupy our territory of Taiwan.

The Chinese people have worked hard to achieve a peaceful solution to the Korean question. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, like the Soviet government and peace-loving governments and people all over the world, has repeatedly advocated that foreign troops should withdraw from Korea and allow the Korean people to decide their own internal affairs, and has repeatedly warned US imperialism. However, the US government, disregarding the repeated proposals and warnings of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, crossed the 38th parallel in October 1950, invaded and occupied Pyongyang on October 20, and frantically invaded the border of the People's Republic of China. Since August, the US invading air force has continuously invaded the airspace of Northeast China. The US government also manipulated and hijacked the UN General Assembly to pass a bloody proposal on October 7 to occupy the entire Korea. The Chinese people could not bear it any longer and decided to organize the Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army in Korea.

From October 25, 1950 to September 10, 1951, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army together wiped out more than 317,000 American and Li bandit troops, including more than 140,000 American, British, French, Turkish and other countries' troops. The invading army that suffered a heavy blow has been driven back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. The US government had to express its willingness to accept armistice negotiations in Korea in July this year.

The Chinese people have always advocated that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully. However, since US imperialism is untrustworthy, the Chinese people cannot but prepare to repel any new attacks by US imperialism while striving for the success of the armistice negotiations together with the Korean people. The democratic parties of China issued a joint declaration on September 3 this year, supporting the solemn stance taken by the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the negotiations, and declared that "as long as the US side does not change its attitude, all responsibility and consequences for the failure of the negotiations must be borne entirely by the US side," and called on all compatriots to "do our best, together with the Korean people, to strive for a victorious end to the Korean war against aggression through long-term struggle, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal."

While valiantly resisting the aggression of US imperialism, the Chinese people have not relaxed their domestic struggle.

In the past two years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has liberated all the territory of the country except Taiwan, which is still occupied by the United States. The peaceful liberation of Tibet in May this year is one of the most important victories achieved by the Chinese people in 1951.

Due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, China has achieved a unity that has never existed in history - the unity of the people of the whole country (including the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic elements) under the leadership of the working class, and the unity of all ethnic groups in China on the basis of equality, unity, and mutual assistance.

In the two years, the Chinese people have universally established the New Democratic state power led by the working class in their liberated areas, and at the same time carried out the enormous task of eliminating bandits, secret agents, and other counter-revolutionary elements remaining on Chinese soil.

Under the leadership of the people's government and the Chinese Communist Party, the broad masses of peasants in the new areas have carried out the struggle for land reform and destroyed the feudal land ownership system. In the past year alone, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of more than 150 million agricultural people, and about 90 million landless and land-poor peasants have been allocated more than 12 million hectares of land. At present, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of more than 310 million agricultural people in China. The land reform work in the remaining areas with a population of less than 90 million agricultural people can also be largely completed in the coming year. The development of land reform has greatly improved the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the peasant masses, and changed the economic, political, and cultural face of China.

Since the Chinese people have overthrown the rule of imperialism and feudalism, established a people's democratic government, consolidated and developed the people's democratic dictatorship and the people's democratic united front, it is possible to begin to restore and develop economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings.

The Central People's Government has made arduous efforts to improve the devastated economic and financial situation. These efforts include the unification and consolidation of finances, as well as the suppression of long-term inflation. According to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Central People's Government strives to complete all necessary preparations in a relatively short period of time in order to begin planned economic construction. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that one preparatory step is land reform. Another preparatory step is the adjustment of old industry and commerce - to reorganize the industry and commerce that originally obeyed imperialism into industry and commerce led by the new state economy. This work has now also achieved important results.

Due to the implementation of land reform and the people's government's assistance to farmers, China's agricultural production has recovered rapidly. This year's grain output will increase by 8% compared with last year, reaching 92.8% of the 1936 level; this year's cotton output is planned to increase by 36.9% compared with last year, exceeding the highest annual output in Chinese history (1936) by more than 10%. Because of this, China's grain this year is not only not like the past Kuomintang era in need of import, but also can be exported. China's cotton can also gradually become self-sufficient.

For the long-term purpose of eradicating floods, the Central People's Government has led the people of the whole country to carry out huge water conservancy construction work. Particularly important is the huge project to harness the Huai River initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong, which has completed the first phase of the project, making this year's Huai River basin the first bumper harvest in many years. From then on, 55 million people in the Huai River basin can begin to get rid of the serious disasters of the Huai River.

In terms of the restoration and development of industrial production, great progress has also been made in the past two years. The existing socialist state-owned industry of the People's Republic of China, its output has accounted for half of the total modern industrial production of the country (state-owned light industry accounts for about one-third of the total light industry, and state-owned heavy industry accounts for about four-fifths of the total heavy industry), which is the leading force of China's New Democratic social economy. China's light industry has generally recovered to the pre-war level, of which the cotton textile industry had already exceeded the pre-war level last year. The heavy industry, which was severely damaged in the war, is also recovering rapidly, and new enterprises are being established.

All of China's more than 22,600 kilometers of railways have now been fully restored to traffic, and new railways are being built in Sichuan, Gansu, and Guangxi provinces. China's approximately 100,000 kilometers of highways have also been fully opened to traffic.

Due to the rapid progress of land reform and the recovery of industrial and agricultural production and transportation, China's domestic trade has developed greatly.

China's foreign trade had already achieved a surplus last year, thereby changing the state of annual deficit since 1877 for 73 years. The unified management of foreign trade affairs by the state and the transformation of the Chinese customs into independence and autonomy have enabled China's foreign trade to begin to break away from the shackles of imperialism, and at the same time have planned to develop trade with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, making their proportion exceed that of trade with capitalist countries.

The state-owned banks and state-owned trade organs of the People's Republic of China have become powerful tools for the state to manage and regulate the market, thereby preventing speculation and serving the development of industrial and agricultural production. Semi-socialist cooperatives had developed to 46,000 by the end of last year, with 30 million members. Under the leadership and assistance of state-owned trade organs, cooperatives have played a significant role in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and in ensuring the daily life needs of the people.

Due to the rapid recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, unemployment in the old liberated areas has been close to eliminated, and people's lives have begun to gradually improve; or have the basic conditions for improvement.

One of the main reasons why the Chinese people have been able to achieve these achievements under the threat of aggression and trade blockade by US imperialism is due to the enormous selfless aid received from the Soviet Union.

    中华人民共和国的两年
    董必武
    中国人民正在满怀着希望和信心来庆祝中华人民共和国成立的两周年。
    两年以前，中华人民共和国的成立，结束了帝国主义和中国反动派的罪恶统治。那些一向依靠在中国人民身上吸血致富的帝国主义者，首先是美帝国主义者，曾经妄以为中华人民共和国的基础是不稳固的，他们决心用军事侵略、经济封锁和特务破坏的办法来加以摧毁。但是历史事实却完全粉碎了帝国主义者的梦想。在过去两年中，中国人民无论是在抵抗外国侵略者的斗争中，在消灭国内反革命残余势力的斗争中，在恢复和建设人民的经济事业和文化教育事业的斗争中，都取得了辉煌的胜利和成绩。中华人民共和国不但没有被摧毁、被削弱，而且已经日益巩固起来、日益壮大起来了。
    中华人民共和国是在反抗帝国主义及其走狗的统治的斗争中成立的，而它在成立以来的头两年的大部分时间，也仍然是在反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争中度过的。
    不甘心在中国失败的美帝国主义，在一年多以前，即在去年六月间，越过八千多公里的太平洋，发动了对我国友好邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的武装侵略，同时派遣海空军侵占了我国的领土台湾。
    中国人民曾努力争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。中华人民共和国中央人民政府和苏联政府及全世界爱好和平的政府和人民一样，历次主张外国军队应撤离朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自行决定朝鲜的内政，并曾不断向美帝国主义提出警告。但是美国政府不顾中华人民共和国中央人民政府和中国人民的历次建议和警告，竟在一九五○年十月越过三八线，十月二十日侵陷平壤，并向中华人民共和国的边境疯狂进犯。美国侵朝空军自八月起不断侵略中国东北的领空。美国政府又操纵和劫持联合国大会在十月七日通过了要占领整个朝鲜的血腥提案。中国人民忍无可忍，决心组织抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿军，前往朝鲜和朝鲜人民军并肩作战。
    自一九五○年十月二十五日到一九五一年九月十日为止，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，一共消灭了美李匪军三十一万七千余人，其中美军及英、法、土等国军队在十四万人以上。遭受痛击的侵略军已被逐回三八线附近。美国政府在今年七月不得不表示愿意接受朝鲜停战的谈判。
    中国人民从来主张朝鲜问题应当和平解决。但是既然美帝国主义是毫无信义的，中国人民就不能不在和朝鲜人民共同争取停战谈判成功的同时，准备着击退美帝国主义的任何新的进攻。中国各民主党派在今年九月三日发表的联合宣言中，支持朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团在谈判中所持的严正立场，宣布“只要美国方面不改变他们的态度，那么，谈判失败的一切责任和后果，必须全部由美国方面担负”，并且号召全国同胞“必须竭尽全力，和朝鲜人民一道，用长期的奋斗来争取朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利结束，不达目的，誓不休止”。
    中国人民在英勇地反抗美帝国主义的侵略的时候，并没有放松国内的斗争。
    在这两年中，中国人民解放军已经解放了除还在美国霸占下的台湾以外的全国领土。西藏在今年五月间的和平解放，是中国人民在一九五一年所获得的最重要胜利之一。
    由于人民解放战争的胜利，中国就出现了历史上从来没有过的统一——全国人民（包括工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子）在工人阶级领导之下的统一，中国境内各民族在平等、团结、互助的基础上的统一。
    中国人民在两年间在自己解放的地区上，普遍地建立了以工人阶级为领导的新民主主义国家政权，同时进行了肃清土匪、特务及残留在中国土地上的其他反革命分子的巨大工作。
    广大新区的农民群众在人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，进行了土地改革的斗争，摧毁封建土地所有制。仅在过去一年间，即有一亿五千多万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，约有九千万无地少地的农民分到了一千二百万公顷以上的土地。现在，全中国已有三亿一千万以上农业人口的地区完成了土地改革。其余的不足九千万农业人口地区的土地改革工作也可以在今后一年内大部完成。土地改革工作的发展，极大地提高了农民群众的政治觉悟和生产热情，改变了中国的经济、政治和文化的面貌。
    中国人民既然推翻了帝国主义和封建主义的统治，建设了人民民主政权，巩固与发展人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线，就有可能着手恢复和发展经济建设事业和文化教育事业。
    中央人民政府作了艰巨的努力以争取历经摧残的经济财政情况的好转。在这些努力中包括财政的统一和整理，以及长期的通货膨胀的制止。按照毛泽东同志的指示，中央人民政府力求在较短的时期内完成各项必要的准备，以便开始有计划的经济建设。毛泽东同志指出一项准备步骤就是土地改革。另一项准备步骤是旧有的工商业的调整——使原来服从于帝国主义的工商业改组为以新的国家经济为领导的工商业。这一项工作现在也已经有了重要的成就。
    由于土地改革的实施和人民政府对农民的援助，中国的农业生产迅速恢复起来了。今年粮食产量将比去年增加百分之八，即达到一九三六年的水平的百分之九十二点八；棉花产量今年计划比去年增加百分之三十六点九，即超过中国历史上最高年产量（一九三六年）的水平百分之十以上。因为这样，中国的粮食在今年已经不但不像过去国民党时代那样地需要输入，而且已经可以输出。中国的棉花也可以逐渐自给了。
    为了根绝水灾的长远目的，中央人民政府领导全国人民进行了巨大的水利建设工作。特别重要的是毛泽东同志所倡议的根治淮河的巨大工程，已完成了第一期工程，使今年的淮河流域得到了多年来的第一次丰收。从此淮河流域五千五百万人民可以开始摆脱淮水的严重灾害了。
    在工业生产的恢复和发展方面，两年来也有了很大的进展。中华人民共和国现有的社会主义性质的国营工业，其生产量已占全国近代工业生产总量的一半（国营轻工业约占轻工业总量三分之一，国营重工业约占重工业总量五分之四），这是中国新民主主义社会经济的领导力量。中国的轻工业一般已恢复到战前水平，其中棉纺织工业早在去年即已超过战前水平。在战争中遭到严重破坏的重工业，也正在迅速恢复起来，并正在建立新的企业。
    全中国二万二千六百多公里的铁路，现在已经全部恢复通车，并正在建筑四川、甘肃、广西三省境内的新铁路线。中国约十万余公里的公路亦已全部通车。
    由于土地改革的迅速进行，工农业生产和交通运输事业的恢复，中国的国内贸易已大为发展。
    中国的国外贸易还在去年即已达到出超，从而改变了自一八七七年起七十三年以来的年年入超的状态。国家对国外贸易事务的统一管理，和中国海关的转为独立自主，使中国的国外贸易开始摆脱了帝国主义的束缚，同时有计划地发展了对苏联及人民民主国家的贸易，使它们的比重超过了对资本主义国家的贸易。
    中华人民共和国的国营银行和国营贸易机关，已经成为国家管理和调节市场，从而杜绝投机活动，并为工农业生产的发展服务的有力工具。半社会主义性质的合作社，在去年年底即已发展到四万六千个，社员达到三千万人。合作社在国营贸易机关的领导和协助之下，在城乡物资交流及保障人民日常生活需要方面起了很大作用。
    由于工农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，失业现象在老解放区已经接近于消灭，人民生活已经开始逐步改善；或者有了改善的基本条件。
    中国人民能在美国帝国主义的侵略威胁和贸易封锁的情况下取得这些成绩的主要原因之一，是由于获得了苏联的巨大的无私的援助。一九五○年二月间中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，使中国人民有了进行反侵略斗争和国家建设的充分保证。苏联的贷款、贸易、技术和经验的巨大援助，促进了中国人民的各项建设工作。中国的经验又一次证明：经济上落后的国家，在摆脱了帝国主义和封建主义的奴役以后，依靠本国人民的团结努力和社会主义国家苏联的友谊援助，完全能够迅速地恢复自己的经济，并迅速地建设成为繁荣、富强的工业化的国家。
    中国人民的文化生活也和以前的黑暗状况完全不同了。在两年中，中国人民展开了一个大规模的学习新思想、新观点，批判旧思想、旧观点的自我教育和自我改造的运动。这对于提高人民的政治觉悟，发生了极大的作用。
    中华人民共和国成立后，越来越多的人在人民政府的帮助下得到了学习文化的机会。前年入冬学学习的农民共有一千万人，去年增加到二千五百万人，今年常年参加业余学校学习的农民已达到一千万人。去年工人业余学校的学生为七十万人，今年已增加到一百五十万人以上。去年全国小学生的总数是三千万人，今年已增加到三千七百万人，这个数字比抗日战争以前的数字增加了百分之五十五以上。
    新中国的新闻出版事业有了极大发展。全国报纸的发行量已达六百万份，约为一九四八年的三倍。去年一年，全国各地共出版各种图书二亿七千一百七十余万册，今年出版图书的册数，将达五亿册左右。
    人民的卫生保健状况也在改善中。去年全国种痘和注射伤寒、副伤寒、霍乱等预防针和接种卡介菌苗的共达八千一百三十余万人，今年截至九月间，种痘的已达一亿七千万人。中国已有三年未发现霍乱病例，伤寒和副伤寒的发病人数也大为减少。
    中华人民共和国两年来的伟大的胜利和成就，雄辩地证明了，在以毛泽东为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府领导之下团结起来了的中国人民，能够战胜一切国外国内的敌人，能够克服一切困难，建设通向社会主义的强大的繁荣的人民民主国家。中国人民正再接再厉地展开抗美援朝运动，支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，并建立强大的国防。中国人民坚定地站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营方面，为摧毁以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营的侵略战争计划而奋斗到底。没有任何力量能够阻止中国人民的前进。
