    Your Spirit Inspired Me to Overcome Difficulties in Study and Work

    Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    I am the son of a worker. After graduating from junior high school after liberation, I entered university. At first, I always felt that my studies were not good enough, and coupled with the lack of money to buy study tools and reference books, it caused me difficulties in learning and weakened my confidence in learning. After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, your bravery, resourcefulness, and courage greatly encouraged me. At our Harbin Institute of Technology, learning Russian is a relatively difficult subject. I was also timid at first, but after seeing your spirit of overcoming difficulties, I asked myself: "The volunteers are also working people and the children of working people. They can make contributions on the front lines. Why can't I learn well? What kind of worker's son am I?" So I made up my mind to learn Russian well. Under your encouragement, in less than a year, I have learned better than the average student. Whenever I have difficulties and problems that cannot be solved, whenever I remember you, I am determined to overcome any difficulties, and any problems are easily solved. I have read the two Korean dispatches, "Who Are the Most Lovable People" and "Young People, Let Your Youth Be More Beautiful," ten or eight times. The more I read, the closer I feel to you, and the more excited I become. I have drawn strength from your heroic deeds and applied it to work and study.

    This year, when the Songhua River flooded, we went to build dikes to save the crops. We got up at three o'clock in the morning to go to Jiangbei, and everyone worked enthusiastically. The sky was gloomy and it was drizzling. By twelve o'clock, the food hadn't arrived yet. Although we were hungry, we still worked. The villagers asked, "Aren't you afraid of getting wet? Aren't you hungry?" Our answer was, "What does this count for? Compared to the volunteers, we are too insignificant." Yes, when we were getting wet and hungry, on the one hand, we were watching the fruits of the farmers' labor—golden soybeans and blood-red sorghum—all ripe, and we couldn't let them be flooded by the river; on the other hand, we were always thinking of you. Your heroic deeds supported us, allowing us to forget being in the rain, forget hunger, and work happily. At seven o'clock in the afternoon, when we were on the boat home, wearing wet clothes from a whole day of rain, and the river wind blew over, everyone felt cold. But when a classmate told the story of the volunteers fighting in the snow in Korea last year, everyone's heart seemed to be burning with fire, and our faces were hot. On the one hand, we were ashamed, and on the other hand, the story did bring warmth, warming our hearts and bodies. Really, we seemed to feel no cold at all. We also sang happily: "Valiantly and spiritedly, we cross the Yalu River, ......" Dear Volunteer Army Comrades, not only have I and my classmates been influenced by you, but the people of the whole country and even the people and youth of the world have been encouraged by you.

    We should thank you! You not only protect our safety, but also give us such good education. You make me unafraid of difficulties, have confidence in work and study, give me courage, and make me love the motherland even more.

    I swear to you: I will study hard, master the advanced Soviet science and technology knowledge, and join the national youth in economic construction in the future, to build our great motherland more beautiful and more lovable.

### 你们的精神鼓舞了我克服了学习和工作中的困难

专栏：读者来信

    你们的精神鼓舞了我克服了学习和工作中的困难亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志们：
    我是一个工人的儿子，解放后刚初中毕业便进了大学。起初总感觉自己功课不行，再加上没有钱买学习用具和参考书，造成我学习上的困难，学习信心不强。在抗美援朝运动开始后，你们的英勇、机智和胆量，大大地鼓励了我。在我们哈尔滨工业大学，学习俄文是一门比较困难的功课。我起初也是胆怯的，但见到你们克服困难的精神后，便问自己：“志愿军也是劳动人民和劳动人民的子女，在前方能立功，我为什么学不好呢？还算个什么工人的儿子？”所以我下决心要学好俄文。在你们的鼓舞之下，不到一年功夫，我已比一般同学学得好了。每当我有困难和不能解决的问题时，一记起你们，什么困难也有决心克服，什么问题也容易解决了。“谁是最可爱的人”、“年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧”两篇朝鲜通讯，我读了十遍八遍，越读越觉得和你们接近，越读越觉得激奋。我从你们的英雄事迹中吸取了力量，用到工作和学习中去。
    今年松花江泛滥时，为了抢救庄稼，我们去修堤坝。早上三点钟便起床去江北，大家很热情地劳动。天是阴霾霾的，下着小雨，到十二点，饭还没送来。虽然饿了，我们还是干。老乡问：“你们不怕淋吗？不饿吗？”我们的回答是：“这又算得什么，比起志愿军来，我们太渺小了。”是的，在我们挨淋时和肚子饿时，一方面看着那农民的劳动果实——金黄色的大豆，血红色的高粱，都已成熟了，不能让它被江水淹掉；另一方面，也老是想着你们，你们的英雄事迹，给我们撑着腰，使我们忘掉了在雨地里，忘掉饥饿，并能愉快地劳动。下午七点，我们坐船回家的时候，穿着淋了一天的湿衣服，江风吹过来，大家都感到冷，但当一个同学讲起去年志愿军在朝鲜雪地里作战的故事时，我们每个人的内心好像燃着了火，脸热热的，一方面是惭愧，一方面确实是故事里带来了温暖，温暖了我们的内心和身体。真的，我们便好像感觉不到冷了似的。我们还愉快地高唱着：“雄赳赳气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江，………”亲爱的志愿军同志们，不但我和我的同学受了你们的影响，全国人民以至全世界人民和青年都受到了你们的鼓舞。
    我们应该感谢你们！你们不独保卫了我们的安全，还给了我们这样好的教育，你们使我不怕困难，工作、学习有信心，使我有了胆量，使我更加热爱祖国。
    我向你们宣誓：我一定要努力学习，掌握苏联的先进科学技术知识，将来去和全国青年一道，参加经济建设，把我们伟大的祖国，建设得更美丽更可爱。
        哈尔滨工业大学  王孟尝
