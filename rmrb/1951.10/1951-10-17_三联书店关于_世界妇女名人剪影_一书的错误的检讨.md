Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

We sincerely accept and thank Comrade Lin Hui for the criticism of our bookstore's book "Silhouettes of World Famous Women," published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on September 14th.

The fundamental error of this book is the loss of the proletarian class stand, placing bourgeois "famous women" and proletarian female warriors side by side for unprincipled introduction and praise. The book also has shortcomings in other parts. The author's "postscript" clearly demonstrates the author's bourgeois viewpoint.

Our bookstore published this book in May of last year (not May of this year). At that time, we printed it without considering such a book. It has been more than a year since publication, and we have never inspected the book, which fully demonstrates our unserious work attitude and irresponsibility to our readers.

We have now decided to stop distributing the book and welcome readers to offer more criticisms of other publications of our bookstore.

### 三联书店关于“世界妇女名人剪影”一书的错误的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    三联书店关于“世界妇女名人剪影”一书的错误的检讨编辑同志：
    九月十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表的林晖同志对我店“世界妇女名人剪影”一书的批评，我们愿诚恳接受，并致谢意。
    该书内容的根本错误，是失去了无产阶级的阶级立场，把资产阶级的“女名人”和无产阶级的女战士并列在一起而加以无原则地介绍和颂扬。在别的部分这本书也有着缺点。作者的“后记”很明显地表现作者的资产阶级观点。
    我店出版这本书是在去年五月（不是今年五月）。当时对这样一本书不加考虑就付印，出版已一年多，我们对该书也始终没有作检查，这都充分说明了我们工作态度的不严肃，和对读者的不负责任。
    我们现在决定将该书停止发行，并欢迎读者对我店其他出版物多多提出批评。
