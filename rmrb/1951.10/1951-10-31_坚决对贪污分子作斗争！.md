    Resolutely Fight Against Corrupt Elements!
    Shenyang City's State Organs
    Universally Launch Anti-Corruption Struggle

    Under the organization and leadership of the Shenyang City People's Supervisory Committee, an anti-corruption struggle has been universally launched in all state organs in Shenyang City.

    Since the liberation of Shenyang City, the vast majority of staff members have been honest and devoted to serving the people faithfully. However, a small number of staff members in some departments have serious corruption problems. Some of these are collective corruption cases. According to statistics from only four major corruption cases, such as the China Coal Industry Construction Company's Shenyang Branch and the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau's Shenyang No. 8 Factory, the country has lost more than 4 billion yuan (calculated in RMB, same below), which has severely damaged the country's economic construction. For example, Zhao Zaitang, director of the Tiexi Wood Factory of the China Coal Industry Construction Company's Shenyang Branch, and seven others colluded with unscrupulous merchants, engaged in private gain through fraudulent means, and collectively embezzled, causing a loss of more than 1.15 billion yuan in state property. Kang Sheng-san, chief of the Personnel Section of the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau's Shenyang Textile No. 8 Factory, and twenty-four others colluded with unscrupulous merchants, sold state materials in large quantities 53 times, causing a loss of as much as 1.24 billion yuan in state property.

    The reason why serious corruption cases occur is, on the one hand, that the corrupt elements themselves have the corrupt habits left over from the Kuomintang reactionaries. After they infiltrated the people's government, they seized the opportunity to repeat their old tricks of corruption (such as the above-mentioned Zhao Zaitang and others and Kang Sheng-san and others, who were all retained personnel); on the other hand, the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of these units also gave the corrupt elements an opportunity to take advantage of. For example, in some departments, dozens of people collectively embezzled for a year, but the leading cadres knew nothing about it. These units usually lack political education for cadres, especially for retained personnel. Some departments do not make any choices when appointing cadres and blindly trust them, allowing corrupt elements to occupy important positions and take the opportunity to embezzle. In addition, lax systems and failure to check work in a timely manner are also important reasons for the occurrence of corruption.

    In order to overcome the serious corruption phenomenon, Shenyang launched an anti-corruption struggle in July. The Shenyang City People's Supervisory Committee, in coordination with relevant departments, focused on investigating and handling several more serious corruption cases, and is preparing to hold a public trial. The chief corrupt elements will be sentenced to death by the court. The problems discovered in this anti-corruption movement, as well as past accumulated cases, will be dealt with separately. Effective plans will be proposed from the aspects of leadership style, management system, cadre education, and cadre policy, and submitted to the government committee and the Municipal People's Congress for discussion and approval for implementation, in order to completely overcome and prevent the serious phenomenon of corruption.

    Xie Huajie et al. of the Sixth Warehouse of Changsha County
    Collective Embezzlement Sentenced to Imprisonment Separately

    Xie Huajie, director of the Sixth Warehouse of Changsha County, Hunan Province, and sixteen others were collectively embezzling state property and have been sanctioned by law.

    The principal offender of embezzlement, Xie Huajie, once served as a special agent, adjutant, and acting company commander in the Kuomintang reactionary army. After the liberation of Changsha, Xie Huajie infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and served as the director of the Sixth Warehouse of Changsha County. Taking advantage of his position, he masterminded the collective theft and sale of public grain with the warehouse keepers of the second, sixth, and seventh sub-warehouses and the staff of the sixth warehouse. From the winter of 1949 to the spring of 1950, they embezzled a total of 19 times. The property collectively embezzled by him and the property he personally embezzled repeatedly totaled more than 24,500 catties of rice. He personally embezzled 14,880 catties of public grain.

    Accomplice Wang Shuqian came from a landlord background and participated in the puppet youth army. After liberation, he served as the warehouse keeper of the fifth sub-warehouse of the sixth warehouse. He embezzled firewood during the autumn collection in 1949, misappropriated public funds, and then stole and sold public grain and falsely reported transportation costs. In total, the collective embezzlement he participated in amounted to more than 2,630 catties of rice, and he personally embezzled 2,403 catties of rice.

    Accomplice Yu Chucai served as a clerk and deputy township head in the puppet township office. After liberation, when he served as the warehouse keeper of the second sub-warehouse of the sixth warehouse, he sold blank grain receipts with Xie Huajie and others, colluded with others to steal and sell public grain, and falsely reported transportation costs. In total, the collective embezzlement he participated in damaged state property totaling more than 6,600 catties of rice, and he personally embezzled 2,040 catties of rice.

    The situation of Xie Huajie and others damaging state property is very serious. The Changsha County People's Court severely punished corrupt elements and protected people's property. In addition to sentencing Xie Huajie, the principal offender who organized collective embezzlement, to life imprisonment, Wang Shuqian, Yu Chucai, and Zhang Zhusan were each sentenced to four years in prison, and Ma Wenxun, He Junqi, Huang Junqi, and Fan Defu were each sentenced to two years in prison. The other offenders were also sentenced separately according to the severity of the circumstances. The above judgments have been reviewed and approved by the Hunan Provincial People's Court. The embezzled property, in addition to deducting the part that has been returned, the remainder will be recovered, and if it cannot be cleared, labor service will be used in lieu.

    Employees of Dingxian County Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company
    Hate Corrupt Elements for Tarnishing the Honor of Employees
    Unanimously Demand Punishment of Corrupt and Theft Elements

    To the Editor: The employees of the Dingxian County Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company conducted an anti-corruption major inspection and found that staff members Cui Changcheng and Liu Kuan had embezzled state property several times. Cui Changcheng came from a student background and joined the Dingxian County Branch Company last year. From February to May this year, he embezzled 541,000 yuan of public funds in four separate incidents. Escort Liu Kuan usually lived a loose life and had backward thinking. In May, when he was guarding the warehouse, he stole a piece of printed cloth and sent it home. All employees felt extremely angry about Cui and Liu's embezzlement and theft, believing that this tarnished the honor of all employees. All employees requested that the administrative leaders give disciplinary sanctions to those who embezzled and stole, and suggested that in the future, attention should be paid to strengthening political education for employees, strictly enforcing systems and discipline, in order to completely eradicate embezzlement and theft.

    Wang Rong Embezzled Repeatedly and Refused to Reform After Repeated Education
    Has Been Subject to Dismissal and Investigation

    Wang Rong, administrator of the Dangtu County Committee of the Communist Party of China in southern Anhui, has been expelled from the Communist Youth League and removed from his post and investigated by the administrative authorities for corruption and degeneration. His qualification as an alternate party member has been revoked.

    Wang Rong is twenty-one years old this year, a member of the Communist Youth League, and an alternate member of the Communist Party of China. He arbitrarily misappropriated public funds in his work, initially three thousand, five thousand, then twenty thousand, thirty thousand, one hundred thousand, eighty thousand; when settling accounts every month, he forged accounts or sold public property to make up for the deficit. According to Wang Rong's confession, he had embezzled more than 1.07 million yuan from July last year to August this year. At the end of the village cadre training class in September last year, Wang Rong embezzled another 504 catties of rice. After the leadership discovered it, they stopped his work for a month and asked him to reflect. In order to test him, he was assigned to work on a construction project. When he sold the surplus tiles to the county cooperative, he embezzled some of the tile money again.

    Wang Rong's embezzlement was to satisfy his corrupt life. Moreover, when he interacted with merchants, he casually accepted hospitality, ate and drank lavishly, and privately borrowed public funds for others to do business.

    The Party and Youth League branches have repeatedly educated him, hoping that he can repent. However, Wang Rong has always been dishonest, passively confronting, and deceiving the organization, until he is beyond redemption, causing great damage to the political prestige of the Party and the League among the masses. In order to maintain discipline and purify the organization, the Party and the League decided to revoke his qualification as an alternate party member and expel him from the League, and the administrative authorities gave him the punishment of dismissal and investigation.

    Suggest the Government Severely Punish Corrupt Elements

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published the news about the corruption of some cadres in the Waterworks of the Harbin Public Utilities Company and the Shanxi Provincial Transportation Bureau on September 12. After reading it, I felt that all agencies and organizations should pay attention to this bad phenomenon.

    The illegal behavior of corrupt elements directly destroys the country's economic construction and harms the interests of the country and the people. The Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting hard, shedding blood, and sacrificing on the front lines to defend world peace, the safety of the people of the motherland, and the construction cause of the motherland. However, individual lawbreakers, for their own enjoyment, embezzle and violate the law, and engage in activities that endanger the people, and steal a large amount of national wealth. The shameless and despicable behavior of corrupt elements is truly intolerable!

    I suggest that the government give severe punishment to all corrupt elements.

    坚决对贪污分子作斗争！
    沈阳全市国家机关
    普遍展开反贪污斗争
    沈阳市人民监察委员会组织领导沈阳全市国家机关，普遍展开了反贪污的斗争。
    沈阳市解放以来，绝大多数的工作人员能廉洁奉公，忠实地为人民服务。但少数部门的部分工作人员，却有着严重的贪污现象。其中有些是集体贪污案件。仅据中国煤业建筑公司沈阳分公司、东北纺织管理局沈阳八厂等四个较大贪污案件的统计，即使国家损失四十余亿元（人民币计算，下同），严重地破坏了国家的经济建设。如中国煤业建筑公司沈阳分公司铁西木厂主任赵再堂等八人，勾结奸商，营私舞弊，集体贪污，先后使国家财产损失十一亿五千万余元。东北纺织管理局沈阳纺织八厂人事科科长康省三等二十五人，与奸商勾结，大批盗卖国家物资五十三次，先后使国家财产损失达十二亿四千万元之巨。
    严重贪污案件之所以发生的原因，一方面是贪污分子本身有着国民党反动派残留的贪污恶习，他们混入人民政府内部后，又伺机重施贪污故技（如上述之赵再堂等八人和康省三等二十五人，都是留用人员）；另一方面，这些单位的领导干部的官僚主义作风，也给贪污分子以可乘之机。如有的部门数十人集体贪污，为时一年之久，而领导干部竟一无所知。这些单位，平时对干部特别是对留用人员缺乏政治教育。有的部门更在任用干部时不加选择，盲目信任，使贪污分子占据重要工作岗位，乘机贪污。此外，制度不严，未能及时检查工作，也是贪污现象发生的重要原因。
    为了克服严重的贪污腐化现象，沈阳在七月份即展开反贪污斗争。沈阳市人民监察委员会与有关部门配合，着重检查与处理了几件较为严重的贪污案件，并准备举行公审，首要贪污分子将由法院判处极刑；对于此次反贪污运动中所发现的问题，以及过去的积案，准备分别进行处理，并从领导作风、管理制度、干部教育、干部政策等方面提出有效方案，提交政府委员会及市人民代表会议讨论批准执行，以期达到彻底克服和防止贪污腐化的严重现象。

    长沙县第六仓库谢华杰等
    集体贪污被分别判处徒刑
    湖南省长沙县第六仓库主任谢华杰等十七人集体贪污国家财产，已经受到法律制裁。
    贪污主犯谢华杰曾任国民党反动军队特务长、副官、代连长等职。长沙解放后，谢华杰混入革命阵营，充任长沙县第六仓库主任，利用职权，主谋与第二、六、七分仓库保管员及第六仓库工作人员集体盗卖公粮等，自一九四九年冬至一九五○年春，先后贪污共达十九次。由他主谋集体贪污的及他个人屡次贪污的财物共折合大米二万四千五百余斤。他个人实际贪得公粮谷一万四千八百八十斤。
    同谋犯王树谦，地主出身，曾参加伪青年军。解放后充任六仓库五分库保管员。一九四九年秋征时贪污木柴，挪用公款，以后又盗卖公粮，浮报运费，总计他所参加的集体贪污共大米二千六百三十余斤，本人实际贪得稻谷二千四百零三斤。
    同谋犯余楚材任过伪乡公所干事及伪副乡长。解放后，任六仓库二分库保管员时，与谢犯华杰等出卖空白粮据，伙同他人窃卖公粮，浮报运费，总计他所参加的集体贪污损害国家财物共计大米六千六百余斤，本人贪污得稻谷二千零四十斤。
    谢犯华杰等损害国家财产的情况十分严重。长沙县人民法院严厉惩罚贪污分子，保护人民财产，除判处组织集体贪污的主犯谢华杰以无期徒刑外，对王树谦、余楚材、张祝三三人各处徒刑四年，马文勋、何钧祺、黄俊奇、范得富四人各处有期徒刑二年。其他各犯也按情节轻重分别判处。上述判决并已经湖南省人民法院审查核准。贪污财物，除将已交还的一部分财物折抵外，余均追交，无法交清时，折服劳役。

    痛恨贪污分子污损职工荣誉
    一致要求处分贪污偷盗分子编辑同志：定县花纱布支公司职工进行了一次反贪污大检查，发现职员崔长城、刘宽曾数次贪污国家资财。崔长城是学生出身，去年参加定县支公司工作，从今年二月至五月份，先后四次贪污公款五十四万一千元。押运员刘宽平时生活散漫，思想落后，他在五月份看守仓库时，偷出一匹花布送回家去。全体职工对崔、刘二人的贪污、偷盗行为，感到极端愤怒，认为这是污损了全体职工的荣誉。全体职工要求行政领导方面予贪污、偷盗者以纪律处分，并建议今后注意加强对职工的政治教育，严格制度和纪律，以便彻底根绝贪污、偷盗行为。

    王荣多次贪污屡教不改
    已受撤职查办处分
    中共皖南当涂县委会管理员王荣，因贪污腐化，已被取消候补党员资格，开除出团，并被行政方面撤职查办。
    王荣今年二十一岁，青年团员，中共候补党员，平时在工作中随便盗用公款，起初三千、五千，继而两万、三万、十万、八万；每月结帐时，即伪造帐目或变卖公物弥补亏空。据王荣供认，从去年七月到今年八月已亏空公款一百零七万元以上。去年九月村干部训练班结束时，王荣又贪污了五百零四斤大米，经领导方面发觉后，停止他的工作一个月，让他作了反省。为了考验他，让他参加了一项建筑工程的工作，他在卖多余的瓦给县合作社时，又贪污了一部瓦款。
    王荣的贪污，是为了满足他的腐化生活。并且，他和商人来往时，随便接受招待，大吃大喝，还私借公款给人经商。
    党、团支部曾三番五次教育他，希望他能痛改前非。而王荣始终不老实，消极对抗，欺骗组织，直到不可救药，使党、团的政治威信在群众中受到很大的损失。党和团为了严肃纪律、纯洁组织，分别决定取消其党员的候补资格，开除其团籍，行政方面并予以撤职查办处分。    陈民生
    建议政府严惩贪污分子编辑同志：九月十二日人民日报发表了哈尔滨市公用事业公司自来水厂及山西省交通局某些干部贪污的消息。我读了之后，觉得各地机关团体，对于这种不良现象都应引起注意。
    贪污分子的违法行为，直接破坏着国家的经济建设，损害着国家与人民的利益。中国人民志愿军为了保卫世界和平，为了保卫祖国人民的安全和祖国的建设事业，在前线艰苦奋斗，流血牺牲，但是，个别不法分子，却为了个人的享受，贪污违法，进行着危害人民的勾当，大量窃取国家的财富。贪污分子的无耻的卑鄙行为，真是不能让人容忍！
    我建议政府应对一切贪污分子给以严厉的惩处。
