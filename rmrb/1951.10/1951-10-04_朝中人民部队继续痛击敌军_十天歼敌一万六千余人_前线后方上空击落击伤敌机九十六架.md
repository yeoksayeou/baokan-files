Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd Dispatch: Our front-line reporter reports: According to statistics from September 16th to 25th, for ten days, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers annihilated another 16,600 enemy troops in blocking and counter-attack battles, of which over 9,900 were American troops, and over 6,700 were Rhee's puppet army and French mercenary troops. Our army destroyed 41 enemy tanks and 48 vehicles, and shot down or damaged 96 enemy aircraft over the front and rear (equivalent to annihilating more than one enemy fighter squadron). On the central front, after the fierce attack launched by the US-Rhee forces on the 21st was frustrated by our severe blows, they still launched attacks daily with infantry under the cover of tanks, but what they encountered was still fierce firepower and bayonet fighting. The invading army often paid a heavy price in casualties under the powerful artillery bombardment and infantry counterattacks of our army, abandoning a large number of wounded soldiers and fleeing in disarray. In the area north of Rinje and Yangkou on the eastern front, the invading army also suffered defeat. On the 22nd, an American battalion continued its assault on the 1211 Highland north of Yangkou, which American reporters described as "Heartbreak Ridge," and was again killed and wounded by our army with more than 190 casualties. The enemy army has been fiercely attacking this highland from the beginning of September to the end of the month, with a large number of deaths and injuries every day. Now the enemy army is still wandering at the foot of the mountain, suffering from the strong firepower of our army. In the Baishi Mountain and Pian Mountain area southwest of this highland, a certain unit of our army also inflicted heavy casualties on the invading enemy. In the areas north and northwest of Tieyuan on the western front, and west of Lianchuan, the small groups of enemy troops that constantly attacked were all defeated and suffered heavy casualties.

    朝中人民部队继续痛击敌军
    十天歼敌一万六千余人
    前线后方上空击落击伤敌机九十六架
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】本社前线记者报道：据九月十六日到二十五日十天的统计：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军又在阻击战和反击战中歼灭敌军一万六千六百余人，其中美军占九千九百余人，李伪军和法国帮凶军占六千七百余人。我军共击毁敌战车四十一辆、汽车四十八辆，并在前线、后方的上空击落击伤敌机九十六架（这相当于歼灭敌军一个多战斗机大队）。在中部前线，美李军自二十一日发动的猛攻在我严重打击下受挫后，每日仍以在战车掩护下的步兵向我进犯，但它所遇到的仍然是猛烈火力的射击和白刃的搏杀。侵略军往往在我军强大炮火轰击与步兵反击下付出惨重伤亡，丢弃大量伤兵狼狈逃窜。在东线麟蹄、杨口以北地区，侵略军也同样遭受挫败。于二十二日，美军一个营继续进犯被美国记者形容为“伤心岭”的杨口以北一二一一高地的战斗中，又被我军杀伤一百九十余人。敌军对这个高地从九月上旬猛犯到下旬，每日有大批死伤。现敌军仍徘徊在山麓下，遭受到我军强烈火力的杀伤。在该高地西南的白石山与片山山地，我军某部也给予进犯的敌人以重大杀伤。在西线铁原以北及西北、涟川以西等地区，不断进犯的小股敌军均被击溃，伤亡惨重。
