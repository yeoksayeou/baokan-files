    Resolutely Eliminate the Pernicious Ideas in Opera that Violate the New Marriage Law and Insult Women
    At a time when the Marriage Law is being vigorously promoted throughout the country, some theatrical troupes are actually distorting the propaganda of the Marriage Law and wantonly insulting women in their performances. For example, the Xingxian Special District Cultural Troupe and the Wuzhai County Theatrical Troupe in Shanxi Province openly performed a play that completely contradicted the spirit of the Marriage Law, a play called "Liu Gaifeng." The content describes a woman who has been divorced three times, and later no one wants her. Her food and clothing become a problem, so she returns to her mother's house. Her brother says, "You demanded a divorce today, and you demanded a divorce tomorrow. Now there's no solution? My family has no food for you either!" Helpless, Liu Gaifeng returns to her first husband's home, and from then on dares not divorce again. After the play was performed, some audience members said, "If women want to get a divorce, tell them to watch last night's play and they won't dare to!"
    The Changsha Dazhong Theater performed a play called "Double Selling Wine." It said that two people drank wine and had no money, so the proprietress asked them to perform a play. So they sang a hodgepodge on the stage, full of filthy language such as insulting women. Similar examples exist in other places.
    These plays, which completely contradict the New Marriage Law and openly promote the barbaric and backward idea of ​​insulting women, are sometimes performed by state-owned theatrical troupes, and sometimes are performed continuously without timely criticism. This shows the local cultural and educational cadres' disregard for the Marriage Law and the serious existence of feudal remnants. It is hoped that the departments concerned will quickly conduct inspections and find out the root causes of these serious errors, in order to completely remove these evil things from the stage.

    坚决清除戏曲中违反新婚姻法与侮辱妇女的恶劣思想
    在全国大力宣传婚姻法的时候，竟还有一些剧团在演出中将婚姻法作歪曲宣传并肆意侮辱妇女的现象。例如山西兴县专区文工团与五寨县剧团竟公然演出一个与婚姻法精神完全抵触的戏，戏的名字叫“刘改凤”。内容写一个离过三次婚的妇女，后来没有人要了，吃穿成了问题，于是回娘家去，她哥哥说：“你今天闹离婚，明天也闹离婚，现在倒没办法了？我家也没饭给你吃！”刘改凤无奈，又回到第一个丈夫家中去，从此再不敢离婚了。该剧演出后，有些观众就说：“女人们要闹离婚，叫她们看一下昨晚的戏就不敢离了！”
    长沙大众戏院演了一出“双卖酒”。说两个人喝了酒没钱，老板娘要他们唱戏，于是他们在戏台上混唱一气，尽是辱骂妇女等等的下流话。类似的例子在其他若干地方也有。
    像这些与新婚姻法完全抵触，公开宣传侮辱妇女的野蛮落后思想的戏，有的竟由公营剧团演出，有的竟连续演出而未受到及时的批评，这说明了当地文教、文艺干部对婚姻法的漠视，和严重地存在着封建思想残余。希望各有关部门迅速进行检查，并找出这些严重错误的根源，以期彻底从舞台上清除这些恶劣的东西。
