    Oppose the US Organizing a Middle East Aggression Bloc
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] The people of Middle Eastern countries warmly support the struggle of the Egyptian people. The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus issued a statement on the 24th, expressing support for the Egyptian people's struggle for national independence and autonomy against imperialism. The statement said: "In their struggle for national independence, the people of Cyprus regard the people of the Middle East and Egypt as brothers fighting for the same ideals of peace, democracy, and independence." The statement considers Britain's actions in Egypt as acts of undermining Egypt's independence and sovereignty, and condemns British imperialism for using Cyprus as a base for British troops to transfer to Egypt.
    In order to support the Egyptian people, the people of Lebanon held a "Support Egypt Day" on October 23. The people of cities such as Beirut, Tripoli, and Saida held demonstrations despite police suppression. The demonstration teams chanted slogans against US and British imperialism.
    People in various parts of Syria continue to hold demonstrations protesting British atrocities in Egypt and supporting the Egyptian people's struggle. Demonstrators in many cities expressed their opposition to the proposal of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey to form a "Middle East Joint Command" aggression bloc. The demonstrators shouted "Down with the imperialist colonialists!" "Wish the Egyptian people victory in their struggle!"
