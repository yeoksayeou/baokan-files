I Saw the Great and Lovable People of the Old Liberated Areas
He Guanqing, Professor, Peking Union Medical College

This time, I was honored to participate in the Central People's Government's Northern Old Revolutionary Base Visit Group. Following Comrade Nie Zhen of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, a small delegation went to the Taiyue District of Shanxi to represent the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao to visit the meritorious people of the old liberated areas. This is a glorious task.

We departed from Beijing on August 10th and arrived at our destination on the 16th. In Qinyuan, Yangcheng, and other places, we conducted key visits and convened mass meetings and representative meetings of various counties.

The masses enthusiastically participated in the meetings. Over 400,000 people attended the mass meetings, and 3,358 representatives attended the representative meetings, representing 24 counties of the old liberated areas, including families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, combat heroes, labor models, local cadres, and the masses. The visit lasted 35 days, with a journey of approximately 2,200 kilometers.

The morale of the masses was very high, and they warmly welcomed us along the way, beating gongs and drums, raising flags and playing music, and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" They prepared tea and refreshments to treat us and filled our vehicles with fresh and sweet fruits for us to eat on the road. When we passed through the Second District of Yicheng, an amiable old man on the roadside threw a 30-jin large pumpkin into our vehicle, with the words "Dedicated to Chairman Mao, to see the good life after liberation, Feng Maoliang of Yangjiahe, Sixth District of Yicheng" written on it. This old man and the broad masses of the old liberated areas understood very well that their good life after liberation was inseparable from the Communist Party of China; Chairman Mao was their benefactor.

When we arrived at the county seats of Qinyuan and Yangcheng, thousands of people ran two or three li outside the city to greet us, and a large contingent of people remained in the city to welcome us. Inside and outside the city, a welcoming team of tens of thousands of people was formed, with slogans posted all over the houses, and everyone enthusiastically applauded us. The sound of gongs and drums, firecrackers, and the cheers of the masses shook the entire city. "Chairman Mao's visit group is here!" In an instant, it became a household name, a major news event, inspiring the masses of the entire city and county.

People from dozens of li around rushed to see Chairman Mao's visit group, wanting to send letters of condolence and present flags and gifts to Chairman Mao. A liberated farmer from Mawu Village, Jincheng, who came to Yangcheng to see our visit group, said happily: "Please tell Chairman Mao that I am doing very well now, I have food and drink, and my ox has been replaced by a horse."

The masses' enthusiasm for Chairman Mao made me realize that the Communist Party of China is truly a party that serves the people wholeheartedly, which is why it receives such enthusiastic support from the people. It made me more deeply realize a truth: whoever stands on the side of the people and seeks the interests of the people everywhere will be supported by the people and will surely succeed; whoever stands on the anti-people's side and violates the interests of the people will be hated by the people and will surely fail. All the manifestations of the people in the old liberated areas can prove that this understanding is correct.

Along the way, we also saw the remnants of the enemy's persecution of the people. The houses in Qinyuan Chengguan and nearby villages were almost completely destroyed by fire. We saw with our own eyes that Caojiazhuang was almost in ruins. This is where 226 compatriots were burned alive by the Japanese invaders in 1942. At the same time, we also saw the heroic people of Qinyuan. Since the enemy occupied Qinyuan Chengguan in October 1942, the surrounding 25 li became a no-man's land where the struggle between the enemy and us was most intense. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the masses were organized, systematically evacuated Chengguan, and actively carried out the struggle to seize and transport grain and surround the enemy. Taking advantage of the dark night, the masses went through the enemy's sentry lines in groups to seize and plant or harvest grain, to transport grain to the place where it was buried, and to destroy traffic on important transportation routes. They set up stone mines on the ground, water mines in the river, hanging mines in the trees, and magnetic mines in the houses, so that the enemy touched mines everywhere, felt that every tree and bush was an enemy soldier, and could not move an inch. At night, the militiamen fired guns everywhere, making the enemy uneasy and laughing and crying. "Passing the Sacred Buddha Ridge (note: the junction of Qin County and Qinyuan) is like entering the gate of hell; if you don't die, you are a living immortal" - this is how people at the time described the enemy's fear of the people of Qinyuan. After two and a half years of intense struggle, the enemy was eliminated, we won, and Qinyuan was liberated. In many other places, the same encirclement method was used to defeat the enemy and liberate cities and strongholds.

This made me deeply realize that the revolutionary achievements of the people in the old revolutionary base areas are immortal; the power of the people in the old revolutionary base areas is great. This made me deeply realize that the victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the people and the Communist Party in the old liberated areas. This made me more deeply understand that "without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." The old revolutionary base areas are the birthplace and the base for the advancement of the Chinese people's revolution.

We saw that the people in the Taiyue Old Liberated Area have a high degree of patriotism and political awareness. Judging only from the masses in Yangcheng and Jincheng, most of them can consciously and happily give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, ensuring that the land yield of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is not lower than the level of the masses. Every household has formulated patriotic covenants, and very appropriately combines patriotism with production competitions, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. For example, in order to increase production and donations, Chafang Village, Fushan, added topdressing fertilizer to more than 300 mu of cornfields this year; the Wang Fuquan mutual aid group in Fancun plans to pre-purchase 20 sheep this autumn, and each group member prepares to donate 10,000 yuan per month. The militiamen of Jiangli Village in Yangcheng expressed great anger at the U.S. imperialism's deliberate sabotage of the Korean peace talks and collectively demanded: "Please tell Chairman Mao, fight if you have to, our village is ready, we have people if we need them, we have money if we need it, and we have food if we need it." In short, the people of the old liberated areas unanimously and resolutely expressed that they would respond to Chairman Mao's call to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" with practical actions.

The people of the old liberated areas' passionate love for the motherland and Chairman Mao deeply moved, inspired, and educated us. We must learn from the great people of the old liberated areas! We want to pay the highest revolutionary salute to the great people of the old liberated areas!

Why do the people of the old liberated areas love Chairman Mao so passionately? Mainly because the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao correctly led the people of the old liberated areas to carry out revolutionary struggles, defeated the Japanese bandits, eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits, fought against the evil landlords, enabled the broad masses of working people to stand up, and live a happy life today.

The level of agricultural production in the Taiyue Old Liberated Area has now been improved. According to our understanding during the visit, except for individual areas where the war damage was too severe, the level of agricultural production in the Taiyue Old Liberated Area has reached and exceeded the level of production before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The amount exceeding the pre-war level is estimated to be around 10 percent. This estimate is not much different from the results of our survey in Daning Village, Yangcheng. Five middle-peasant households in Daning Village had the same area of cultivated land before and after the land reform, but the average output in the past two years has been 13 percent higher than the pre-war level. The results of other comrades' surveys in other villages are also the same.

We know that the Taiyue Old Liberated Area suffered very serious damage from the enemy during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. But under such circumstances, the people of the old liberated areas were able to restore production to or even exceed the pre-war level in a short period of time; undoubtedly, this is a definite and amazing achievement, which is the great power of the people of the old liberated areas.

How could the level of production in the Taiyue Old Liberated Area be improved so quickly? The most fundamental reason is that the land reform changed the relations of production. After the land reform, the peasants stood up and were allocated land. Naturally, the peasants put more labor and fertilizer on their own land. "Plowing more, hoeing more, and applying more manure" has become a common phenomenon for peasants to cultivate land in the Taiyue Old Liberated Area, not only for cultivating their own land, but also for cultivating land for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. It is said that two years ago, some farmers were still worried about the land they had been allocated, which affected their enthusiasm for production. Now, the farmers know that the landlords will never return, so their enthusiasm for production has been further improved, and land prices have also risen accordingly. Two years ago, one mu of land was worth about two dan of rice, but now it is worth seven dan of rice.

After the relations of production were changed, the organization of mutual aid groups in various villages and the systematic organization and leadership of peasant labor undoubtedly promoted the progress of production. In addition, women's participation in agricultural production labor, the gradual increase in animal power, and the widespread implementation of seed selection and pest control further promoted the development of agricultural production. The Taiyue Old Liberated Area has shown good results in relying on the masses to eliminate insect pests. In Yangcheng County alone, the county government mobilized more than 45,000 laborers (accounting for more than 80% of the county's labor force) in 50 days this year, using 650,000 workdays, and quickly eliminated the cotton insect pests.

Due to the improvement of the level of production, the lives of the people in the Taiyue Old Liberated Area have improved day by day. There are no beggars, no thieves, and no robbers. In the past, some farmers rarely ate salt, but now every household has salt to eat. In the past, poor and middle peasants had to eat chaff and wild vegetables to fill their hunger. As the saying goes: "If you don't eat chaff for three days, you have no idea what to do." Now the situation is different. Everyone has food to eat and no longer eats chaff. They also eat white flour during the New Year and holidays. In the past, ordinary people wore tattered clothes, but now ordinary people wear neat and tidy clothes; many people have three or four sets of clothes or more; during the New Year and holidays, everyone is happy and wears new clothes. In the past, thermos bottles and flashlights were things that urban people enjoyed, but now some farmers in the old liberated areas also carry thermos bottles to cultivate land during the day and flashlights to attend meetings and watch plays at night.

With the improvement of life, a high tide of people demanding cultural entertainment has emerged in the old liberated areas. The old liberated areas have their own drama troupes organized by the masses, which take turns to perform in various places, and the audience is crowded every time. But movies are still rare, so the masses are very interested in the movies we brought to the old liberated areas. No matter where they are shown, people from dozens of miles around come to watch, and the audience is very crowded, often reaching tens of thousands of people. In Yangcheng, more than 50,000 people watched the movie in one night; the front of the screen was full, so they ran behind the screen to watch on both sides! Movies are a new thing in the old liberated areas. The characters on the screen can move and speak. It is indeed mysterious and wonderful! An old man in Qinyuan asked us if the movie we were showing could be seen ten li away, so that the people in their village could see Chairman Mao's movie. An old woman in Yangcheng passed away peacefully the morning after watching the movie at night. The masses said that she was blessed to see Chairman Mao's movie and had not lived in vain for a lifetime!

The masses in the Taiyue Old Liberated Area universally demand to learn politics and culture, but the existing cultural facilities cannot meet the needs of the masses. The current situation in the old liberated areas is that there are very few schools and teachers, but there are very many students. It is generally estimated that about 50% of school-age children are out of school, especially in villages in the mountains, where the phenomenon of children being out of school is particularly significant. The situation in senior elementary schools is even more serious. Qinyuan has five senior elementary schools, which can only accommodate 300 new students each year, but more than 1,300 people have registered for the exam. Yuanqu County Senior Elementary School can only enroll 60 new students, but more than 600 people have registered for the exam. People's schools are very common, and almost every village has them, but it is still difficult to set up people's schools in remote areas. For example, Chuan Kou Village, Fushan, cannot set up a people's school because it cannot find a teacher. Among the more than 700 people in the whole village, only five or six can barely recognize some characters. The young women of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are even more eager to learn culture, and demand that the government establish a school for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers as soon as possible. It is obvious that the people in the old liberated areas have a high enthusiasm for progress and learning. Although schools are increasing year by year, they still cannot meet the learning needs of the masses.

After a long period of revolutionary struggle, the people of the old liberated areas deeply realize who is the enemy, who is the relative, and realize that without the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, there would be no good days to stand up today. Therefore, the people of the old liberated areas enthusiastically support the Communist Party, enthusiastically love Chairman Mao, and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism arming Japan.

This is the great and lovable people of the old liberated areas who moved and educated me.

    我看见了伟大可爱的老区人民
    北京中国协和医学院教授  何观清
    这次我很荣幸地参加了中央人民政府北方老根据地访问团，随着中共中央华北局聂真同志率领的一小分团，到山西太岳区，代表中央人民政府和毛主席去访问劳苦功高的老区人民。这是一个光荣的任务。
    八月十日由北京出发，十六日抵达了目的地。在沁源，阳城，及其他等地，我们进行了重点访问，召集了群众大会和各县代表会议。
    群众非常踊跃地参加会议；参加群众大会的，计达四十余万人，代表会议出席人数计有三千三百五十八名，代表二十四个县老区的烈军干属、革命残废军人、战斗英雄、劳动模范、地方干部和群众。访问历时三十五天；行程约二千二百余公里。
    群众的情绪很高涨，沿途热烈地欢迎我们；敲锣打鼓，扬旗奏乐，高呼毛主席万岁；盛备了茶点，来招待我们；向我们车上送满了鲜甜果子，要我们带着路上吃。当我们经过翼城二区的时候，路旁有一位笑容可掬的老汉，向我们车上投进一个三十斤重的大南瓜，瓜上写着：“献给毛主席，看看翻身后的好光景，翼城六区杨家河冯茂良。”这位老汉和广大的老区群众都很明白，他们翻身后的好光景是和中国共产党分不开的；毛主席就是恩人。
    我们抵达沁源和阳城县城的时候，先有数千群众跑到城外二三里地来迎接，还有大队群众留在城内，等候着欢迎我们。城外城内形成了数万人的欢迎队伍，家家户户满贴着标语，每个人都热烈地鼓着掌欢迎我们，锣鼓声，鞭炮声，群众的欢呼声，震动了全城。“毛主席的访问团来了！”瞬息之间，便成为家喻户晓的新闻大事，鼓舞了全城全县的群众。
    周围数十里的群众都赶来看毛主席的访问团，要向毛主席致慰问信和献旗献礼。赶到阳城来看我们访问团的，有位晋城马壁村的翻身农民，他很高兴地说道：“请你们告诉毛主席，我现在的光景很好，有吃有喝，我的牛已经换成马了。”
    群众爱戴毛主席的热情，使我认识到中国共产党真是全心全意为人民服务的党，所以才受到人民这样热烈的拥护；使我更深刻地认识到一个真理：凡是站在人民的立场上，处处为人民谋利益的，必受人民拥护，结果一定成功；凡是站在反人民的立场上，违背人民的利益，必被人民憎弃，结果一定失败。老区人民的一切表现，处处可以证明这一认识是对的。
    沿途我们也看见敌人残害人民的残迹，沁源城关及附近村庄，民房毁烧殆尽。我们亲眼看见曹家庄，几成荒墟。这就是一九四二年日寇活活烧死了二百二十六个同胞的地方，同时我们也亲眼看到沁源的英勇人民。自从一九四二年十月敌人占据沁源城关后，周围二十五里就成为敌我斗争最剧烈的无人区。在中国共产党领导之下，群众都组织起来了，有计划地撤离城关并积极进行抢种、抢运粮食和围困敌人的斗争。乘着黑夜，群众成群结队地通过敌人的哨防线，到无人区去抢种或抢收，到埋藏粮食的地点去抢运粮食，到交通要道去破坏交通。设石雷于地上，水雷于河道中，吊雷于树上，磁雷于屋中，使敌人到处触雷，感觉草木皆兵，寸步难行。夜间民兵到处放枪，使敌人坐眠不安，啼笑皆非。“过了圣佛岭（注：沁县与沁源的交界），如同进了鬼门关；如若死不了，除非活神仙。”——这是当时描写敌人畏惧沁源人民的话。这样经过了二年半的剧烈斗争，敌人被消灭了，我们胜利了，沁源解放了。其他还有不少地方，也是采取同样的围困办法战胜了敌人，解放了城市和据点的。
    这使我深刻地认识到老根据地人民的革命功绩是永垂不朽的；老根据地人民的力量是伟大的。这使我深刻地认识到中国革命的胜利与老区人民和共产党是分不开的。这使我更深刻地体会到“没有共产党，就没有新中国”。老根据地就是中国人民革命的发源地和前进的基地。
    我们看到太岳老区人民有高度的爱国热情和政治觉悟，仅从阳城、晋城的群众看，多能自觉愉快地优待烈军属，保证了烈军属的土地产量不低于群众的水平。家家户户都订立了爱国公约，很适当地将爱国主义结合到生产竞赛、镇压反革命和抗美援朝工作上面。例如：为了增产捐献，浮山茶坊村今年就把三百多亩的玉米地加了追肥；范村王富全互助组今秋预购二十只羊，每个组员准备每月捐献一万元。阳城匠礼村的民兵对于美帝国主义故意破坏朝鲜和平谈判，表示非常愤怒，集体要求：“请你们告诉毛主席，该打就打，我们村已准备好了，要人有人，要钱有钱，要粮有粮。”总之，老区的人民一致坚决地表示以实际行动来响应毛主席的号召“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。
    老区的人民这样热烈地热爱祖国和毛主席，深深地感动、鼓舞和教育了我们。我们要向伟大的老区人民看齐！我们要向伟大的老区人民致最崇高的革命敬礼！
    老区的人民为什么这样热烈地爱戴毛主席呢？主要是因为中国共产党和毛主席正确地领导了老区人民进行革命斗争，打垮了日本强盗，消灭了蒋阎匪帮，斗争了恶霸地主，使广大的劳动人民翻了身，过着今天幸福的好日子。
    太岳老区的农业生产水平现在已提高了。根据我们在访问中了解到的情况，除了个别战争破坏过甚的地区外，太岳老区的农业生产水平已经达到和超过抗战前的生产水平。超过战前水平的数量估计在百分之十左右。这个估计数与我们在阳城大宁村调查所得的结果，相差无几。大宁村有五户中农，耕地的面积在土地改革前后丝毫没有变动，但是近二年来的平均产量却比战前水平高出百分之十三了。另外的同志在其他村调查的结果也是这种情况。
    我们知道太岳老区在八年抗战中，遭受敌人的破坏是非常严重的；但在这样情况之下，老区的人民竟能于短短期间内将生产恢复到甚至超过抗战前的水平；无疑的，这是一个肯定的惊人的成绩，这就是老区人民伟大的力量。
    太岳老区的生产水平怎么会这样迅速地提高呢？最基本的原因是由于土地改革改变了生产关系，经过土地改革，农民翻了身，分得了土地，农民自然而然地在自己的土地上多加劳力，多上肥料。“多犁，多锄，多上粪”，在太岳老区已成为农民耕地的一个普遍现象，非但对耕种自己的田地是如此，而且对代耕烈军属的土地也是这样。据云二年前，有些农民对于分得的土地还有顾虑，以致影响到生产的情绪，现在农民知道地主永远不会回来了，生产的情绪因此更加提高了，地价也随着上升了，两年前，一亩地约值二石米，现在已值七石米了。
    生产关系改变以后，各村组织互助组，有系统地组织和领导农民劳动，无疑地推动了生产的进步；再加上妇女参加农业生产劳动，畜力逐年增加和普遍地实行选种与防治虫害，更促进了农业生产的发展。对于依靠群众来消除虫灾，太岳老区表现有很好的成绩。单是阳城一县，今年县政府在五十天之内就发动了四万五千余劳力（占全县劳力百分之八十以上），用了六十五万个工，很迅速地把棉花虫灾消灭了。
    由于生产水平的提高，太岳老区人民的生活已一天比一天好转了。没有乞丐，没有小偷、强盗。过去有一部分农民很少吃到盐，现在家家都有盐吃了。过去贫农和中农都要吃糟糠野菜充饥。俗语说：“三天不吃糠，肚里没主张。”现在情形却两样了，人人都有饭吃，不吃糟糠了，过年过节还吃上白面。过去老百姓穿得破烂不堪，现在老百姓都穿得整整齐齐；好些人都有三四套以上的衣服；过年过节开会，人人高高兴兴，穿着新衣裳。过去热水瓶和手电筒是城市人享受的东西，现在老区农民有的白天也带着热水瓶去种地，晚间也带着手电筒去开会、看戏。
    随着生活的改善，老区涌现了人民要求文化娱乐的高潮。老区有群众自己组织的戏剧团，轮流到各地去演戏，场场观众拥挤。但是电影还是稀罕的，所以群众对于我们带到老区去放映的电影，发生浓厚的兴趣。无论在什么地方放映，周围数十里的群众都赶来看，观众甚为拥挤，常达数万人之多。在阳城看电影的群众，一天晚上就到五万多人；银幕前面坐满了，跑到银幕后面去，两面看！电影在老区是件新鲜的东西，银幕上的人物，又会活动，又会说话，的确是神秘奥妙！沁源有位老汉问我们放映的电影是否可以照到十里以外，好让他们村里的群众能看到毛主席的电影。阳城有位老婆婆晚上看完电影，翌晨就安然地去世了，群众说她有福气，看见了毛主席的电影，没有白活了一辈子！
    太岳老区的群众普遍地要求学习政治、文化，但是现有的文化设施都不能满足群众的要求。在老区现在的情形是：学校和教员都特别少，而学生特别多。一般的估计，约有百分之五十的学龄儿童失学，尤其在山沟里的村庄，儿童失学的现象尤为显著。高小的情形更为严重，沁源有五座高小，每年只能收容三百名新生，但报名投考的却有一千三百余名，垣曲县高小只能收纳新生六十名，但报名投考的却有六百余名，民校是很普遍的，几乎每村都有，但在偏僻的地区，设立民校仍有困难。例如：浮山川口村因为找不到教员，想办民校也就办不成了。在全村七百余人口中，只有五六个勉强认识些字的人。烈军属青年妇女们要求学习文化更为迫切，要求政府早日成立烈军家属学校。很明显地，老区人民要求进步，要求学习的情绪是很高涨的，学校虽然逐年增加，但还不能满足群众学习的要求。
    经过长期间的革命斗争，老区人民深深地认识到谁是敌人，谁是亲人，认识到没有中国共产党和毛主席，就没有今天翻身的好日子，所以老区人民热烈地拥护共产党，热烈地爱戴毛主席，坚决地反对美帝国主义武装日本。
    这就是感动和教育了我的伟大可爱的老区人民。
