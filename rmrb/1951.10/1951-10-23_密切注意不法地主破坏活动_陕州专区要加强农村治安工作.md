    Pay Close Attention to Sabotage Activities by Unlawful Landlords
    The Shanzhou Special District Must Strengthen Rural Public Security Work

To the Editor:

    Recently, a number of unlawful landlords and reactionary elements in the Shanzhou Special District of Henan Province have been carrying out sabotage activities. They are sabotaging production and even using poison, attempting to kill revolutionary cadres and working people. For example, Li Shiru, an illegal landlord in Duguan, Lushi County, uprooted more than 100 hemp plants from the land allocated to farmer Zhang Zhenwen. Yuan Anshun, a bad element in the Fourth District of Wenxiang County, instructed his son to put anesthetic into the anus of farmer Ren Wancheng's ox in an attempt to obstruct production. Poison was found in melons in the Fourth District of Mianchi County. Zhang Hongjun, a landlord in Shahe District, the Third District of Lushi County, threatened farmers immediately after being released.

    The above situation once again illustrates that the enemy is not reconciled to its demise and will seize every opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. People in all areas should be vigilant. The Shanzhou Special District should further strengthen public security work in rural areas.

### 密切注意不法地主破坏活动  陕州专区要加强农村治安工作

    密切注意不法地主破坏活动
    陕州专区要加强农村治安工作编辑同志：
    近来，河南省陕州专区有不少不法地主和反动分子进行破坏活动。他们破坏生产，甚至施放毒品，企图杀害革命干部和劳动人民。如卢氏县杜关非法地主李士儒，将农民张振文分得的土地内的大麻拔掉一百多棵。阌乡县第四区坏分子员安顺，指使他的儿子将麻药放到农民任万成的耕牛的肛门里，企图阻挠生产。渑池县第四区发现敌人在瓜内放毒。卢氏县第三区沙河区地主张鸿钧刚被释放，即威胁农民。
    上述情况，再一次说明了敌人不甘心于自己的灭亡，还要利用一切机会进行破坏活动。各地人民应提高警惕。陕州专区应进一步加强农村中的治安工作。
