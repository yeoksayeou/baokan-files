    Visiting the "Kagarlovo" Village Agricultural Cooperative
    —"From the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea" - Part 2
    Xinhua News Agency Resident in Prague Reporter Wu Wentao
    Traveling southeast from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, for about two hours by car, you will reach a wealthy agricultural area of Bulgaria - the Maritsa River Plain. On May 27th of this year, I visited the "Kagarlovo" Village Agricultural Cooperative, which has been established for six years on this plain. Kagarlovo Village is located more than a hundred miles east of Plovdiv. Out of the 650 households in the village, 630 have joined this agricultural cooperative.
    Because the car broke down on the way, Comrade Mutafchiev from the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and I got out of the car in front of the cooperative's office when the sun was already setting behind the mountains. A clerk from the cooperative came out and led us to the office. In the center of the office was the director's desk, with eleven desks on each side, which were the seats for the twenty-two work team leaders. On the wall behind, hung the production plans and progress charts of each work team. Facing the door was the pledge of increased production made by all the cooperative members to Premier Chervenkov this year: "Strive to produce 160 kilograms of cotton and 12 tons of watermelon on each decare (approximately equivalent to a strong Chinese mu) of land..."
    The cooperative's chairman, Popov, who is fifty-six years old, walked in with a group of cooperative members, saying repeatedly, "Welcome! Welcome!" He was wearing a grass-green, half-sleeved shirt, as if he had just finished work. His face, tanned a reddish-brown, was framed by a pair of reading glasses. This blacksmith, who had only ten decares of land before liberation, was one of the initiators of the "Kagarlovo" Village Cooperative in the spring of 1945. The history of the cooperative's growth is tortuous. When the cooperative was first established in 1945, only 140 households joined, the vast majority of whom were poor peasants. Due to insufficient rainfall in 1946, the organization of the cooperative was not yet on track, and the post-war economic difficulties and inadequate equipment caused difficulties for the cooperative's agricultural production increase work. At this time, some individual members, influenced by the rich peasants, carried out "dissolution" activities. All the cooperative members struggled against the activities of a small number of splitters and expelled them. Later, with the help of the Party and the government, the cooperative strengthened its organization and received large loans from the government. Although there was a drought in 1947 and 1948, the benefits of machinery and collective farming were already apparent. The average harvest per decare of land in the cooperative was 30 percent higher than that of individual farmers. Slowly, middle peasants joined in large numbers, forming the scale it is today.
    Throughout Bulgaria, agricultural cooperatives are developing like the "Kagarlovo" Village Agricultural Cooperative. To this day, the number of farmers organized in cooperatives accounts for 54 percent of all Bulgarian farmers.
    The "Kagarlovo" Village Agricultural Cooperative has a total of 18,000 decares of land. These lands were originally small plots of two or three decares each, but now the boundaries have been broken down and divided into thirty large blocks for tractor cultivation. If there is land belonging to rich peasants or non-members in between, it will be exchanged for land of equal quality according to law. Of the cooperative's income, after deducting expenses and public accumulation funds, 75 percent is distributed according to the number of "labor days" of the members, and 25 percent is distributed according to the quantity and quality of the land contributed by the members. Distributing a portion of the income according to the land is to take care of some of the middle peasants, because they have more land. The "Kagarlovo" Village Agricultural Cooperative belongs to the third category in the classification of agricultural cooperatives in general Eastern European People's Democratic countries. But when Chairman Popov spoke about this, the cooperative members surrounding him chimed in and said, "Next year we will distribute all the fruits entirely according to labor days and abolish the method of distribution according to the amount of land contributed. Because everything is produced by labor, distributing according to land is a kind of unearned income!" This means that next year this cooperative will adopt the fourth category - the highest level of organization, which is equivalent to the collective farms of the Soviet Union. (Note: The first category of agricultural cooperatives is collective cultivation without breaking the boundaries of the land, similar to the Chinese mutual aid teams; the second category is breaking the boundaries of the members' land, collective cultivation, but the crops on each person's land at harvest belong to each person, and those who work more on less land are compensated by a work-point system.)
    The determination of labor days is a very important link. The standards for various tasks in the cooperative are set by the general meeting of all members according to the difficulty. Generally speaking, completing a certain quantity and quality of a certain task in a ten-hour workday is one full labor day. Particularly strenuous tasks, when a certain quantity and quality are completed within ten hours, are counted as 1.75 labor days. Some lighter tasks are set as 90% or 75% of a labor day. The number of labor days of the members is reviewed and registered by the squad leader of each work team. Chairman Popov especially emphasized the quality of work. If a work team has good work quality and a large harvest, it can get an extra bonus at the end of the year. He said: In this regard, not enough attention was paid to it in the past, but it has now been improved.
    In order to understand more clearly how the cooperative distributes income according to labor days while taking into account the amount of land contributed, I took the opportunity to ask Yelefu, a middle peasant who joined the cooperative in 1949, who was sitting close to me, to talk about his own situation. He found their team's ledger, and on the special page under his name, there was a column recording the land he contributed: a total of 27 decares, worth 450,600 leva (Bulgarian currency, 500 leva equals one US dollar), and another column recording the work completed by Yelefu and his wife in 1950: 373 "labor days". The cash distributed according to "labor days" totaled 130,550 leva. The part distributed according to the land was 42,570 leva. Among the physical objects he received in a year, there were 734 kilograms of wheat, 62 kilograms of barley, 356 kilograms of sunflower seeds, 904 kilograms of corn, etc. The cash part is the income from the sale of the cooperative's harvest to the government or the supply and marketing cooperative.
    According to the law, Eastern European countries implement a system of agricultural product procurement, that is: the government sets prices for various products, and procures a certain amount of agricultural products from farmers and cooperatives according to the number of mu planted and the quality of the land. Farmers or cooperatives have the obligation to sell the products that the government requires to be purchased to the government first, in order to ensure the food needs of the non-agricultural population. Some crops monopolized by the state, such as tobacco, need to be sold to the government in full, and the government supplies cheap shredded tobacco or cigarettes. In order to take care of the interests of the vast majority of farmers, the amount of procurement stipulated by the government varies according to the composition of the farmers: the rich peasants have the most, followed by the middle peasants, and then the cooperative farmers and poor peasants. For example: For rich peasants who own more than 120 decares of land, the government procures 70 kilograms of wheat per decare of first-class land; for poor peasants with 10 decares of land - 8 kilograms of wheat per decare of first-class land; for lower middle peasants with 20 decares of land - 35 kilograms of wheat per decare of first-class land; cooperatives use machines to cultivate and produce more, and only purchase 30 kilograms. The reason for such a difference is to facilitate cooperative members and the vast majority of individual farmers to sell their surplus grain and other products to the free market at higher prices and obtain rich income. In addition, cooperative members are tax-exempt for two years after joining the cooperative, and after two years, they only pay 7 percent on the cash income.
    By the time we talked about this, the lights were already on. The twenty-two captains all came to report on their work, so we agreed to come back early the next morning and first return to Haskovo town nearby to stay overnight.
    The next morning, Chairman Popov and a cadre sent by the Ministry of Agriculture to inspect and assist the accounting work of the cooperative led us to see the livestock and farming situation. The cooperative raises 119 horses, 340 cattle and buffaloes, 900 sheep, 2,000 chickens, and more than 100 pigs. The pigsty is managed by Gonyev, an 18-year-old war orphan, who has six years of pig-raising experience. Six years of cooperative life have made him and his 80-year-old grandmother not only have enough food and clothing, but also built a new-style brick house including four bedrooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom. His dedication to his duty, coupled with the help of veterinarians from nearby state farms, enabled him to ensure that none of the dozens of litters of piglets and hundreds of adult pigs he cared for last year died.
    We walked towards the sound of machines outside the village. After passing through an endless expanse of golden wheat fields, we came to a small stream. Next to the stream was a large well, and an electric pump drew water from the well, which was then irrigated to a 400-decare flat land through a water tower more than ten feet high, ready to plant tobacco. The electric pump is managed by only one person, and the amount of water pumped exceeds the amount absorbed by five waterwheels. We visited the tobacco seedling planting work team led by Stanbolov. What surprised me was that except for the 50-year-old Stanbolov, all the dozen or so members were women. They were wearing pink and light green "Bulgarian" style robes that reached their knees, and their heads were wrapped in brightly colored silk scarves. If it weren't for their bare feet stepping into the muddy water, you would almost imagine them to be a group of city women. A young woman of about twenty years old told me that she completed 160 "labor days" herself last year, and will do more this year. The reason is that her child does not need to keep her tied at home, but is taken care of by the female members in shifts. "This year," she said, "we will build a special nursery. Wouldn't that be even better then?" I asked her about her opinion on collective labor, and she said, "We work collectively, sing collectively, and nothing can separate me from the cooperative today!"
    I turned to Stanbolov, a middle peasant who joined the cooperative last year with forty decares of land, and asked him the motivation for joining the cooperative. He said, "To be honest, in the past, the two of us in my family farmed the land, and we didn't dare to rest for a minute from morning till night, and our annual income was not even as good as that of Gonyev, the 18-year-old pig farmer in the cooperative. Now, we can rest for two hours at noon, and our income has also increased. ... Think about it, just breaking the boundaries of the land and using tractors to cultivate the land, the seeds that our cooperative saved last year alone can build a large club!"
    At noon, we were invited to Popov's house for dinner. Sitting in the courtyard under a walnut tree, drinking his homemade wine. I talked with him about his experience in leading the cooperative, and I frankly asked him what was the main reason why he had been elected as chairman for six years? Popov put aside his own achievements and attributed the results first to the leadership and help of the Communist Party branch. He said, "The biggest enemy is to be dizzy in front of the achievements." He repeatedly praised Premier Chervenkov's recent summary of the mistakes of forcing farmers to join the cooperatives. He emphasized the importance of strict economic accounting. His organizational experience is first of all to enable the members to not only exert their strength most effectively during the busy farming season, but also have appropriate work during the slack season. When publicizing the benefits of using machines and science to farmers, we must make everyone think of the people's country and the increasingly prosperous new society. In addition, leading the cooperative should be fair, and have a healthy mind to fight back against the rumors of rich peasants and other reactionary elements. He said, "The more people join the cooperative, the more fierce the attacks and sabotage of the reactionary elements will be."
    At this time, Mrs. Popov came back from the field, and without even taking off her shoes, she went to bake bread, and directed the nephews and daughters-in-law who came to help to first mix the small white radishes and fresh shallots with clear oil and vinegar as snacks, and then take out their daily home-cooked dishes: a large plate of homemade sausages for each person, and a large plate of cube-shaped white cheese (somewhat like Chinese stewed tofu) fried with butter. Mrs. Popov apologized for not coming home earlier to prepare more dishes. I said, "I was born in the countryside of old China. Before liberation, my parents only had a few meals like this during the New Year!" Chairman Popov also interjected and said, "Ordinary Bulgarian farmers in the bourgeois era were the same. Such a beautiful life is given to us by the People's Government and the cooperative road!"
    At three o'clock in the afternoon, I said goodbye to these simple and enthusiastic people. Popov asked me to bring a message to the working farmers of China, wishing them success in their cooperative cause.

    访“卡加洛沃”村农业合作社
    ——“从黑海到波罗的海”之二
    新华社驻布拉格记者  吴文焘
    从保加利亚首都索非亚向东南行，约有两个钟头的汽车行程，就到了保加利亚的一个富庶的农业区——马里乍河平原。我在今年五月二十七日访问了在这个平原上的已成立了六年的“卡加洛沃”村农业合作社。卡加洛沃村在普罗夫迪夫城以东百余里的地方。全村六百五十户居民中，已有六百三十户参加了这个农业合作社。
    由于汽车在途中抛锚，我和保加利亚外交部的穆塔夫契也夫同志在合作社办公室门前下车时，太阳已经靠山了。合作社的一个文书出来把我们带到办公室去。办公室正中是主任的办公桌，两边各摆着十一张桌子，这是二十二个工作队队长的座位。后面的墙上，挂着各工作队的生产计划和进度表，迎门是全体社员今年向契尔文科夫总理提出的增产诺言：“争取在每一狄卡尔（约合一市亩强）的土地上产棉花一百六十公斤，产西瓜十二吨……。”
    五十六岁的合作社主席波波夫和一群社员走进来，连声说：“欢迎！欢迎！”他穿着一件草绿色的、半卷着袖子的衬衫，像是刚刚放下工作一样，晒得铁红的脸上，架着一付老花眼镜。这位解放前仅有十狄卡尔土地的铁匠，是一九四五年春“卡加洛沃”村合作社的发起人之一，这个合作社成长的历史是曲折的。一九四五年合作社刚成立时，最先入社的只有一百四十户，绝大多数是贫农。由于一九四六年雨水不足，合作社的组织又没有上轨道，加上战后经济困难、设备不周，合作社的农业增产工作遭遇了困难。这时，就有个别社员受了富农的影响，进行“散伙”活动。全体社员对一小撮分裂分子的活动进行了斗争，把他们开除出去了。后来，在党和政府的帮助下，合作社加强了组织，得到了政府的大宗贷款。一九四七年和一九四八年虽然天旱，但是机器和集体耕作的利益就已显露出来。合作社每狄卡尔土地上的收获量，平均比个体农民多百分之三十。慢慢地，中农就大量地入社了，形成了今天的规模。
    在保加利亚全国范围内，农业合作社也像“卡加洛沃”村农业合作社一样在发展着。到今天，组织在合作社里的农户，已占全保加利亚农户的百分之五十四了。
    “卡加洛沃”村农业合作社共有一万八千狄卡尔土地。这些土地本来都是三两狄卡尔一小块的，现在已经打破地界，并为三十大块，以便使用拖拉机耕种。如果中间夹有富农或非社员的土地，就依法用另外同等质量的土地交换。社里的收入，除了开支和公积金外，有百分之七十五按社员“劳动日”的多少，百分之二十五按社员加入地亩的数量和质量来分配。按地亩分配一部分收入，是为了照顾到部分的中农，因为他们的土地比较多。“卡加洛沃”村农业合作社，在一般东欧人民民主国家农业合作社的分类上，是属于第三类的。但当波波夫主席讲到这点时，围在四周的社员们纷纷插言说：“明年我们就完全按照劳动日分果实，取消照加入地亩多少而分配的办法了。因为一切都是劳动产生的，按地亩分就是一种不劳而获呢！”这就是说，明年这个合作社将采取第四类——最高级的组织形式，这类合作社相当于苏联的集体农场。（按：第一类农业合作社是共同耕种而不打破地界，类似中国的变工队；第二类是打破社员的地界，共同耕种，但收获时各人地亩的作物归各人所有，另以记工办法偿付地少多劳者。）
    劳动日的划订，是一个极为重要的环节。社里各种工作都按轻重由全体社员大会定出标准来。一般说，在一天十小时工作中，完成某项工作的一定数量和质量，就是一个全劳动日。特别吃力的工作，在十小时内完成一定数量和质量时，即为一点七五劳动日。有些较轻的工作，定作九成或七成五劳动日。社员劳动日的多少，由各工作队的小队长审查登记。波波夫主席特别强调工作的质量。一个工作队的工作质量好、收获多，年终就可得到额外的奖金。他说：在这方面，过去有一个时期注意不够，现在已经改进了。
    为了更加明了合作社如何按照劳动日同时照顾到加入地亩的多少来分配收入，我顺便请靠近我坐着的一个在一九四九年入社的中农叶列夫说说他自己的情形。他把他们一队的账本找出来，在他名下的专页上，有一栏记着他加入的地亩：共二十七狄卡尔，值四十五万零六百利瓦（保币名，每五百利瓦合一美金），另一栏记着一九五○年叶列夫和他的妻子完成的工作：三百七十三个“劳动日”。按“劳动日”所分得的现金，共十三万零五百五十利瓦。按照地亩所分得的部分为四万二千五百七十利瓦。在他一年内所分得的实物中，有七百三十四公斤小麦、六十二公斤大麦、三百五十六公斤向日葵子、九百零四公斤玉米等等。现金部分是社内收获物出售给政府或产销合作社的收入。
    按照法律，东欧各国都实行农产品征购制，即：政府对各种产品规定价格，按所种亩数及土地质量，向农户和合作社征购一定数量的农产品。农户或合作社有义务尽先把政府规定要征购的产品卖给政府，以保证非农业人口的食粮等需要。有些由国家专卖的作物，如烟草，需全部卖给政府，由政府供给廉价的丝烟或纸烟。为了照顾绝大多数农民的利益，政府规定的征购额因农户的成份不同而有区别：富农最多，中农次之，合作社农民和贫农又次之。例如：凡拥有一百二十狄卡尔土地以上的富农，政府对他们每狄卡尔一等地征购小麦七十公斤；十狄卡尔的贫农——每狄卡尔一等地征购八公斤；二十狄卡尔的下中农——每狄卡尔一等地征购三十五公斤；合作社用机器耕种产量多，也只征购三十公斤。所以有这样的差别，是为了便利合作社员及绝大多数个体农民，以较高的价格向自由市场出售他们剩余粮食和其他产品，而获得丰厚的收入。此外，合作社员在入社后两年内免税，两年以后，仅照现金收入部分交纳百分之七。
    谈到这里，已经上灯了。二十二个队长都来等着汇报工作，我们便约定第二天清早再来，先回到附近哈斯克佛镇住宿。
    第二天早晨，由波波夫主席和一个农业部派来视察并协助合作社的会计工作的干部，引导去看家畜和耕作情况。合作社养有一百十九匹马、三百四十头黄牛和水牛、九百头羊，二千只小鸡和百多头猪。管理猪栏的是十八岁的战时孤儿哥尼夫，他已经有了六年的养猪经验。六年的合作社生活，使他和八十岁的老祖母不但衣食丰足，还盖了一所包括四间卧室、一个厨房和洗澡间的新式砖房。他的忠于职守，加上附近国营农场兽医的帮助，使他去年照料的十几窝小猪和百多头大猪无一死亡。
    我们向村外响着机器声的方向走去。经过一望无际的金黄色的麦田，我们走到一条小溪边。溪旁有一孔大井，一具电动抽水机从大井里抽出水来，经过一个丈多高的水塔，向一块四百狄卡尔的平地灌溉，准备种烟草。电动抽水机只由一个人管理，抽水量超过五个水车的吸水量。我们参观了由斯坦包洛夫所领导的插烟苗的工作队。使我惊异的是：除了五十岁的斯坦包洛夫外，十几个队员都是妇女。她们穿着粉红的、淡绿的、长达膝盖的“布拉及”式袍，头上裹着颜色鲜艳的丝巾，不是赤着的、踏到泥水中去的脚，你几乎会想像她们是一群城市里的女子。一个年约二十的少妇告诉我：她去年自己完成了一百六十个“劳动日”，今年还会多些。原因是她的孩子无需把她缠在家里，而由女社员们轮班照顾。“今年”她说：“我们就盖好专门的托儿所了。那时不是更好了吗？”我问她对于集体劳动的意见，她说：“我们集体工作，集体歌唱，今天什么东西也不能使我和合作社分离！”
    我转向去年带着四十狄卡尔土地入社的中农斯坦包洛夫，问他入社的动机。他说：“老实说，过去我一家两口人种地，从早到晚不敢休息一分钟，一年的收入还赶不上合作社里养猪的十八岁的哥尼夫。现在，我们中午可以休息两小时，收入也增加了。……想想看，单只打破地界用拖拉机种地，我们合作社去年一年省下的种子，就可以盖一座大俱乐部呢！”
    中午，我们被邀到波波夫的家去吃饭。坐在院子里一棵胡桃树下，喝着他家自制的葡萄酒。我和他谈领导合作社的经验，我率直地问他六年来一直当选为主席的主要原因是什么？波波夫把自己的功劳放在一边，将成绩首先归诸共产党支部的领导和帮助。他说：“最大的敌人就是在成绩面前昏头昏脑。”他连连称赞契尔文科夫总理最近所总结的强迫农户入社的错误。他强调指出严格的经济核算的重要性。他的组织工作经验，首先就是使社员们不仅在农忙时能够最有效地发挥力量，而且在农闲时也有适当的工作。在向农民宣传使用机器和科学的好处时，要使大家想到人民的国家，想到日益美满的新社会。另外，领导合作社要公正，要有健康的头脑来回击富农和其他反动分子的造谣。他说：“人们入社的越多了，反动分子的攻击、破坏就更加厉害起来。”
    波波夫夫人这时从地里回来，连鞋也没顾得穿，就去烤面包，并指挥着来帮忙的侄媳们先把小白萝卜和鲜葱用清油和醋调起来下酒，另外把他们当天中午的家常菜拿出来：每人一大盘自制香肠，一大盘用牛油烧的块状的白乳酪（有些像中国的炖豆腐）。波波夫夫人对于没早些回家多准备些菜表示抱歉。我说：“我生在旧中国的农村里，在解放前，我的父母只在过年时才有几顿这样的饭食呢！”波波夫主席也插进来说：“资产阶级时代的一般保加利亚农民也是那样。这样美好的生活是人民政府、合作道路所给予我们的！”
    下午三点钟的时候，我和这群朴实、热情的人们告别了。波波夫要我带个信给中国的劳动农民们，祝他们在合作事业上获得成功。
