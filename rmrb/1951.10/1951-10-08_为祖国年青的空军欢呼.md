    Cheering for the Young Air Force of the Motherland
    To the Editor:
    On National Day, I saw many jet fighters being reviewed. They were so majestic and beautiful as they flew over Beijing. I jumped up, applauded, and cheered! My throat was hoarse.
    I remember during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was the planes of Japanese invaders that flew in the sky. Enemy planes bombed and strafed us, and there were often terrifying air raid sirens. At that time, I always thought: if we had our own people's country, and our own people's air force, the motherland's airspace would not be invaded by enemy planes. With such hope, I welcomed the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. At this time, other planes appeared in the sky. The American invaders gave planes to Chiang Kai-shek to slaughter the Chinese people.
    Now, we truly have our own people's country, and our own planes. If any bandit planes dare to run rampant again, they will be met with a head-on blow.
    The new China has only been established for two years, and we can already see so many new types of planes. Next year, and the year after, we will have more planes, and the American imperialists will tremble even more.
    I truly realize the glory and pride of being a Chinese person. I firmly guarantee to the motherland: I will study hard to be a good student of Chairman Mao, and be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time!

### 为祖国年青的空军欢呼

    为祖国年青的空军欢呼编辑同志：
    国庆节那天，我看到了很多受检阅的喷气式战斗机。它们飞过北京城的上空时，是那样雄壮和美丽。我跳起来，鼓掌，欢呼！喉咙都嘶哑了。
    我记得，抗日战争时期，在天空飞的是日本强盗的飞机，敌机向我们轰炸、扫射，常常响着恐怖的警报声。那时我总想：要是有了人民自己的国家，有了人民自己的空军，祖国的领空就不会被敌机侵袭了。怀着这样的希望，我迎接了抗日战争的胜利。这时候，天空出现了另外的飞机。美国强盗把飞机给了蒋介石，用来屠杀中国人民。
    现在，我们真正有了人民自己的国家，有了自己的飞机了。任何强盗飞机再来横行，就要受到迎头痛击。
    新中国建立才两年，我们已经能够看到这样多这样新式的飞机；明年、后年，我们的飞机会更多，美帝国主义者要更加发抖了。
    我真正体会到做一个中国人民的光荣和骄傲。我坚决向祖国保证：努力学习做一个毛主席的好学生，准备随时响应祖国的召唤！
