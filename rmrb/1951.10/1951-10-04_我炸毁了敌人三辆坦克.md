I destroyed three enemy tanks
People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Chen Desheng

    I am a soldier of the Volunteer Army, and I gloriously participated in the Changjin Lake battle last December. At that time, the enemy was beaten to pieces by us and fled in all directions. One night, on the highway in Xixingli, the enemy's tanks, cars, and artillery were jammed together, trying to escape eastward, but they were blocked by our brotherly units. At that time, my platoon was ordered to attack, and the squad leader led our entire squad to rush down like tigers descending from the mountains. When we rushed to within ten meters of the enemy, they fired at us with intensive firepower. My left face was injured. In order not to delay the squad leader from carrying out his mission, I told them to advance, and I bandaged the wound with a first-aid kit. At this time, I thought of the suffering of the Korean people and the suffering of the Chinese people when the Japanese devils occupied China. I felt very resentful towards the American imperialists for invading Korea. I then carried my rifle in my left hand and a grenade in my right hand, and rushed towards a tank. I threw the grenade forcefully towards the rear of the tank, hitting the tank's fuel tank. The tank immediately caught fire. Shrapnel from the grenade injured the right corner of my mouth. Blood was flowing down, but I didn't care. When I looked up, I saw an American devil crawling out of the tank. I was about to shoot him, but he fired a shot first, damaging the sight on my rifle, passing through the middle finger of my left hand, and cutting a line on my wrist. I endured the pain and returned a shot. The American devil screamed and died in the vehicle. Then I hit a second tank. When I was preparing to hit the third tank, I touched my body and realized that I had no more grenades. I ran to the north and picked up a grenade from a comrade who had already sacrificed. At this time, my left hand was injured, and my right hand was also frozen. I couldn't open the grenade cover, so I used a bayonet to pry it open, bit the fuse ring with my mouth, and with a strong pull, I threw the grenade. This grenade exploded again on the rear of the third tank, causing smoke, and the tank caught fire again. I walked to the front of the second damaged tank and saw another devil crawling out. I forgot that he was a foreigner and didn't understand Chinese, so I shouted, "Don't move! Don't move!" He was so frightened that he immediately retracted his head. I knew he would definitely come out, so I turned to the right. A devil shot at me with a carbine, but he didn't hit me. I returned a shot and knocked him down. By this time, it was almost dawn. Because I had no grenades, I couldn't blow up any more tanks, so I walked back to my own position. At this time, I had four injuries on my body and lost too much blood. I was carried off the front line, and then I didn't know anything.
    After the battle ended, the military headquarters commended me as a "Lone Hero." (Attached picture)

    我炸毁了敌人三辆坦克
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  陈德生
    我是一个志愿军的战士，我光荣地参加了去年十二月长津湖战斗。那时敌人被我们打得落花流水，四处逃窜。一个深夜，在西兴里的公路上，敌人的坦克、汽车、大炮挤做一团，想往东逃，但被我们兄弟部队阻住了。当时我排奉命出击，班长就带了我们全班像猛虎下山似地冲下去，冲到离敌人十几公尺的时候，敌人以密集的火力向我们打过来。我的左脸被打伤了，为了不耽误班长执行任务，我叫他们前进，自己用救急包包了伤口。这时我想起了朝鲜人民的苦难，想起了日本鬼子侵占中国时祖国人民所受的苦难，对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，感到非常痛恨，我便左手提着步枪，右手拿着手榴弹，向一辆坦克冲去。我用力把手榴弹向坦克后边抛去，正炸中坦克的油箱，坦克马上起火了；手榴弹爆片伤了我的右嘴角；血直往下流，我也不管。一抬头我看见坦克上边钻出来一个美国鬼子，我正要打他，而他却先放了一枪，打坏了我步枪上的标尺，穿过我左手的中指，又在手腕上划了一道。我忍住疼，还了一枪，美国鬼子哇的叫了一声，便死在车上了。接着我又打着了第二辆坦克，在我预备打第三辆的时候，一摸，手榴弹已经没有了，我便跑到北边，在已经牺牲了的同志身上拣到了一颗手榴弹。这时我左手受伤，右手也冻僵了，掀不开手榴弹盖，便用刺刀挑开盖子，用嘴咬住弦圈，猛一拉，才把这个手榴弹扔出去。这颗手榴弹又在第三辆坦克屁股上炸了，冒起烟，坦克又着火了。我走到第二辆被炸坏的坦克前面，看到上面又钻出一个鬼子来，我忘了他是外国人，不懂中国话，大喊：“别动！别动！”他吓的马上缩回了头。我知道他一定会出来，我便转到右边去。一个鬼子用卡宾枪打我，没打中我，我回了一枪把他打倒了。这时天已快亮了，我因为没有手榴弹不能再炸坦克，便走回自己的阵地去。这时我身上受了四处伤，流血过多，被抬下了火线，以后便什么也不知道了。
    战役结束以后，军部嘉奖我为“孤胆英雄”。（附图片）
