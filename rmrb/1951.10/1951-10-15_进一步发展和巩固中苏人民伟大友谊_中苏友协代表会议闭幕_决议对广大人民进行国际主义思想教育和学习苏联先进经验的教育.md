Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The First National Representative Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association concluded on the 13th. The conference opened on the 5th and lasted for nine days. Through repeated discussions in general assemblies, large groups, and small groups, it summarized the work of the past two years and stipulated the guidelines and tasks for further developing Sino-Soviet friendship work in the future.

The representatives from various regions attending the conference, including various nationalities and from all walks of life, totaled 244. All representatives unanimously agreed that in the past two years, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in conjunction with the central tasks of various regions, especially in conjunction with the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Country over the past year, has carried out work such as introducing the Soviet Union, learning from the Soviet Union, and Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges among the broad masses, and has carried out internationalist ideological education, thereby developing and consolidating the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and making the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association a powerful mass organization with more than 17 million members.

The representative conference resolved that in the future, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association must resolutely and rapidly shift from general calls to an in-depth, concrete, and rich stage; according to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the actual thinking and life of the masses, conduct internationalist ideological education and education on learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union for the broad masses. In order to accomplish the above basic tasks, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations at all levels should specifically understand the ideological situation of members and the broad masses, starting from the actual thinking of the masses, use the specific and vivid facts of the Soviet Union to educate our people, resolutely eliminate the remnants of anti-Soviet thought, refute the anti-Soviet slanders of domestic and foreign reactionaries, criticize narrow nationalist views on Sino-Soviet relations, and eliminate doubts and concerns among the masses about the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship. When carrying out work, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions must closely integrate with the central tasks of the country. The current central task is the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Country, as well as national defense and economic construction. It is necessary to resolutely overcome the two different deviations of working in isolation from the central tasks of the whole country and the central tasks of various regions, or abandoning one's own work.

The representative conference resolved that on the basis of propaganda and education work, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions should continue to develop membership, expand and consolidate the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and expand and consolidate the internationalist propaganda front and propaganda team. If anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary elements are indeed found among the members, they should be exposed and expelled from membership in order to maintain the purity of the organization.

Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, made a summary at the meeting. He theoretically clarified the basic understanding that should be had on Sino-Soviet friendship issues and the future work characteristics of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and made specific explanations on future propaganda work, development, and consolidation of organizational work. He emphasized that in the future, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the leadership work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations at all levels, strengthen political and ideological leadership work, and strengthen the political and ideological nature of the work.

At the closing ceremony of the conference, Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government and Director of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke. He pointed out that the achievements of this representative conference mark that Sino-Soviet friendship will be further consolidated and developed in the future. He encouraged the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to further strengthen the propaganda of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation on the basis of existing work, educate the people of the whole country to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union, and complete the construction tasks of our motherland. Shen Junru, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the closing speech. The conference also passed telegrams to Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao.

    进一步发展和巩固中苏人民伟大友谊
    中苏友协代表会议闭幕
    决议对广大人民进行国际主义思想教育和学习苏联先进经验的教育
    【新华社十四日讯】中苏友好协会第一次全国代表会议已在十三日闭幕。这次代表会议在五日开幕，历时九天，经过大会、大组和小组反复讨论，总结了过去两年来的工作，规定了关于今后进一步开展中苏友好工作的方针和任务。
    出席会议的各地代表，包括各民族、各界，共计二百四十四人。全体代表一致认为：两年来，中苏友好协会结合各地中心工作，特别是结合了一年来的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，已在广大人民群众中展开了介绍苏联、学习苏联和中苏文化交流等工作，进行了国际主义的思想教育，从而发展和巩固了中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，并使中苏友好协会发展为拥有一千七百多万会员的强大的群众团体。
    代表会议决议今后要坚决和迅速地把中苏友好协会的工作从一般号召转入深入具体有丰富内容的阶段；根据马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，结合群众的思想实际和生活实际，对广大人民进行国际主义的思想教育和学习苏联先进经验的教育。为完成上述基本任务，各级中苏友好协会应具体了解会员和广大群众的思想情况，从群众的思想实际出发，运用苏联的具体生动的事实，教育我国人民，坚决肃清反苏思想的残余，驳斥国内外反动派的反苏谰言，批评关于中苏关系的狭隘民族主义观点，消除群众中对苏联和中苏友好问题上的怀疑和顾虑。各地中苏友好协会进行工作时，必须密切结合国家的中心任务，当前的中心任务是抗美援朝保家卫国运动及国防和经济建设，坚决克服脱离全国中心任务和各地中心工作而孤立进行工作或放弃本身工作的两种不同偏向。
    代表会议决议各地中苏友好协会要在宣传教育工作的基础上，继续发展会员，扩大和巩固中苏友好协会的组织，扩大、巩固国际主义的宣传阵地和宣传队伍，如果在会员中发现确实有据的反苏反革命分子，应即予以揭露并开除其会籍，以保持组织的纯洁性。
    会议由中苏友好协会总会总干事钱俊瑞作总结，他从理论上阐明对中苏友好问题应有的基本认识和中苏友好协会今后的工作特点，并对今后的宣传工作、发展和巩固组织工作等作了具体说明。他强调指出，今后必须大力加强各级中苏友好协会的领导工作，加强政治思想领导工作，加强工作的政治性和思想性。
