Xinhua News Agency, 13th - According to TASS: Pravda and Literaturnaya Gazeta both published editorials on the 11th, commenting on the worldwide reaction to Stalin's remarks on the atomic weapons issue.

	Pravda published an editorial titled "The Noble Cause of the People of the World," saying: Progressive humanity around the world warmly supports Stalin's talk, unanimously believing that it once again proves the Soviet Union's consistent peace-loving policy. Inspired by the great ideas of actively defending peace, the people of all countries are undertaking the cause of safeguarding peace with increasing confidence, and are increasingly resolutely demanding a halt to the expansion of armaments and the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. They know that war instigators are stepping up their activities to undermine peace. The heads of the Anglo-American aggressive bloc are carrying out a frantic arms expansion movement, developing military bases and establishing mercenary forces to carry out military gambling. The increasingly serious war crisis forces peace-loving people all over the world to be more vigilant and to more resolutely expose the sinister conspiracies of Anglo-American imperialism. Now, the world peace movement is gradually strengthening, and the ranks of peace fighters are growing day by day. Approximately 500 million people worldwide have signed petitions demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, which vividly demonstrates their will to defend international peace and security. The editorial concluded by saying: The Soviet Union, as a strong bastion of international peace and security, is at the forefront of the struggle to defend peace. The Soviet people's unremitting struggle to safeguard and consolidate peace is an inspiring example for the ordinary people of all countries who are fully determined to defeat the conspiracies of war instigators and defend the cause of peace.

	Literaturnaya Gazeta published an editorial titled "A Great Call for Peace," saying: The people of the world welcome Stalin's talk with deep satisfaction. The Soviet Union's calm and firm voice is being heard precisely when Hitler's thugs are strutting on the streets of West German cities and Japanese samurai are filling the barracks. Atomic weapons must be banned—good people all over the world support this demand. Stalin's talk strengthened people's belief in their own strength and increased their determination to defend peace.

    苏联真理报和文学报评论指出
    全世界进步人类拥护斯大林谈话表明他们决心保卫国际和平安全
     【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社消息：真理报和文学报都在十一日发表社论，评论斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话在全世界的反响。
    真理报以“全世界人民的崇高事业”为题发表社论说：全世界进步人类热烈拥护斯大林的谈话，一致认为它再次证明了苏联的爱好和平的一贯政策。各国人民正在积极保卫和平的伟大思想的鼓舞下，怀着日益增强的信心，把维护和平的事业担当起来，并且日益坚决地要求停止扩张军备和缔结五大国和平公约。他们知道：战争挑拨者正在加紧破坏和平的活动。美英侵略集团的头目们正在进行疯狂的扩军运动，开拓军事基地和建立雇佣军以进行军事赌博。越来越严重的战争危机，使全世界的和平拥护者不得不提高警惕，更坚决地揭露美英帝国主义的罪恶阴谋。现在，世界保卫和平运动正在逐渐加强，和平战士的队伍一天天地壮大。全世界已有约五亿人民签名要求五大国缔结和平公约，这生动地表现了他们保卫国际和平和安全的意志。社论最后说：作为国际和平与安全的坚强堡垒的苏联，走在保卫和平斗争的最前列。苏联人民维护和巩固和平的不懈斗争，对于有充分决心击败战争挑拨者的阴谋和保卫和平事业的各国普通人民，是一个令人鼓舞的榜样。
    文学报发表题为“伟大的和平号召”的社论说：全世界人民怀着深深满意的心情来欢迎斯大林的谈话。苏联发出沉着和坚定的声音，正是希特勒暴徒在西德城市的街道上高视阔步、日本武士充斥了兵营的时候。原子武器必须禁止——全世界善良的人民都支持这个要求。斯大林的谈话加强了人民对自己力量的信念，增加了他们保卫和平的决心。
