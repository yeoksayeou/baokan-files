    Brotherly Meeting
    Collaboration by Ma Keming and Qin Zheng
    (1) On the morning of August 11th, the Shenxin Textile Factory in Hankou was filled with cheers as workers welcomed more than 300 peasant representatives. These peasant representatives were invited by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee from Henan and Hubei provinces to visit Wuhan. The workers have long established a close, inseparable friendship with these cotton farmers who work diligently in the fields to produce raw materials for the textile factory. Their meeting today is naturally particularly cordial.
    (2) As the worker attendants guided the peasant brothers into the carding room and introduced them to the model worker Zhou Guixiang, Zhou Guixiang and the steel wire carding machine she managed were immediately surrounded by the peasants.
    (3) Wu Jinxiang, a 66-year-old cotton farmer, rushed forward and excitedly said to Zhou Guixiang: "Without Chairman Mao's leadership, how could we have met today!"

    兄弟会晤
    马克明  秦征合作
    （一）八月十一日清早，汉口申新纱厂里欢声沸腾，工人们正在欢迎三百多位农民代表。这些农民代表是中南军政委员会财政经济委员会从河南、湖北两省邀请来武汉参观的。工人对这些长年在田野间辛勤地为纱厂生产原料的棉农，久已在心坎上建立了血肉相连的友谊，今天相逢，自然特别亲切的。
    （二）当工人招待员引导着农民弟兄们步入梳棉间并向他们介绍了劳动模范女工周桂香时，周桂香和她所管理的钢丝车立刻被农民们紧紧包围起来。
    （三）六十六岁的棉农吴金祥抢上去，向周桂香激动地说道：“没有毛主席的领导，我们那能有今天的会面！”
