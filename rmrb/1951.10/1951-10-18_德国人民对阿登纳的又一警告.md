	Another Warning to Adenauer from the German People
	The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a special meeting on the 10th of this month, passing a joint telegram from all parliamentary factions to the West German "Parliament," reiterating the proposal of September 15th and providing a clear response to the West German "Parliament's" statement.

	Establishing a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany is the urgent demand of all German people. The People's Chamber proposed to the West German "Parliament" on September 15th to convene an all-German conference and hold free all-German elections. Adenauer, fearing opposition from the German people, dared not directly reject the People's Chamber's proposal and resorted to despicable means of evasion and delay. Recently, the West German "Parliament," based on Adenauer's statement, proposed "fourteen conditions" for holding free all-German elections, attempting to use this to conceal its conspiracy to oppose the People's Chamber's proposal; and specifically put forward the requirement of so-called "international supervision" as a prerequisite for holding all-German elections. This means allowing the Western occupiers to interfere with and obstruct the all-German elections, indefinitely postponing the convening of an all-German conference, in order to realize its conspiracy to make West Germany join the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. However, in order to prevent the all-German conference from being delayed due to Adenauer's unreasonable obstruction, the People's Chamber stated that most of the "fourteen conditions" put forward by the West German "Parliament" were acceptable, and even the so-called "international control" issue could be discussed at the all-German conference. However, the People's Chamber requires the West German "Parliament" to give a clear answer as to whether it agrees to convene an all-German conference and hold free all-German elections.

	Undoubtedly, the People's Chamber's repeated efforts to convene an all-German conference are in line with the wishes and interests of all the German people. The People's Chamber's correct proposals and aboveboard actions have won the support of all peace-loving people in Germany and the world. It is impossible for the Adenauer "government" to attempt to evade and delay any longer. The increasingly expanding struggle of the German people for German unification, democracy, and peace is forcing the Adenauer "government" to face up to the important issues concerning the vital interests of the German people.

### 德国人民对阿登纳的又一警告

    德国人民对阿登纳的又一警告
    德意志民主共和国人民议会于本月十日举行了特别会议，通过了各议会党团致西德“议会”的联名电，重申九月十五日的建议，并对西德“议会”的声明作了明确的答复。
    建立一个统一、民主和爱好和平的德国，是全体德国人民迫切的要求。人民议会曾于九月十五日向西德“议会”提出关于召开全德会议与举行全德自由选举的建议。阿登纳害怕德国人民反对，不敢正面拒绝人民议会的建议，而采取了躲闪和拖延的卑劣手段。最近西德“议会”根据阿登纳的声明提出举行全德自由选举的“十四点条件”，企图以此来掩饰其反对人民议会建议的阴谋；并特别提出要求实行所谓“国际监督”，作为举行全德选举的先决条件。这就是说，要让西方占领者来干涉并阻挠全德选举，使召开全德会议无限期地延搁下去，以便实现其使西德参加北大西洋侵略集团的阴谋。但是，为了使全德会议不因阿登纳的无理阻挠而延搁下去，人民议会对西德“议会”提出的“十四点条件”，表示大多数可以接受，甚至所谓“国际管制”问题也可以在全德会议上讨论。但是，人民议会要求西德“议会”必须对是否同意召开全德会议与举行全德自由选举的问题作明确的答复。
    无疑地，人民议会对召开全德会议的一再努力，是符合全德国人民的愿望和利益的。人民议会的正确的建议与光明磊落的行为，已获得全德国和全世界爱好和平人民的拥护。阿登纳“政府”再企图躲闪与拖延是不可能的。日益扩展的德国人民争取德国统一、民主与和平的斗争，迫使着阿登纳“政府”必须正视有关德国人民切身利害的重要问题。
