    After overcoming the righteous opposition of Soviet representative Tarabukin, the United Nations Security Council, manipulated by British and American imperialism, passed a resolution on October 1 to interfere in Iran's internal affairs and discuss the Iranian oil issue. This illegal resolution completely violates the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries as stipulated in the United Nations Charter, and once again proves that the United Nations has increasingly degenerated into a shameful tool for British and American imperialism to carry out aggression.
    Since March of this year, the movement of the Iranian people demanding the nationalization of the oil industry has been surging higher and higher. Faced with the growing strength of the Iranian people, British and American imperialism has adopted a series of despicable means of threats and inducements, both hard and soft: when negotiations failed, they threatened with warships and paratroopers; when threats were ineffective, they "appealed" to the International Court of Justice, and finally even had the American Harriman come forward to interfere. But all these means of British and American imperialists obviously did not achieve their despicable aggressive goals. Now they are bringing out the tool of the United Nations to carry out interference, which only shows that their plunder plan has reached the end of its rope.
    The Iranian people's anti-imperialist movement has victoriously and effectively struck at the ruling position and war preparation conspiracy of British and American imperialism in the Middle East, and has inspired the movement of the people of the Middle East and Near East to fight for national independence. It can be believed that this movement will continue to expand, the strength of the Iranian people will continue to grow, and the conspiracy of British and American imperialism to use the United Nations to carry out further interference will continue to be defeated.

    黔驴技穷之后的可耻图谋
    十月一日，联合国安全理事会不顾苏联代表查拉布金的正义的反对，在美英帝国主义的操纵之下，通过了干涉伊朗内政、讨论伊朗石油问题的决议。这一非法的决议，完全违反了联合国宪章所规定的不干涉他国内政的原则，再一次证明了联合国已经日益沦为美英帝国主义进行侵略的可耻的工具。
    自今年三月以来，伊朗人民要求石油工业收归国有的运动愈来愈高涨。在日益壮大的伊朗人民力量面前，美英帝国主义曾采取了一系列的威胁利诱，软硬兼施的卑劣手段：谈判不成，即以军舰伞兵威胁；威胁无效，“上诉”国际法院，最后甚至由美国的哈里曼出面进行干涉。但是美英帝国主义者的这一切手段，显然都没有达到它们的卑鄙侵略目的。现在它们搬出联合国这个工具来实行干涉，只不过是表示它们的掠夺计划已经到了黔驴技穷的地步了。
    伊朗人民的反对帝国主义的运动，已经胜利地有效地打击了美英帝国主义在中东的统治地位与备战阴谋，并且鼓舞了中东与近东各国人民争取民族独立的运动。可以相信，这一运动必将继续扩展，伊朗人民的力量必将继续增长，美英帝国主义利用联合国实行进一步干涉的阴谋必将继续遭到失败。
