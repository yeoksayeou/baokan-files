Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Hamburg News: In West Germany's two largest northern ports, Hamburg and Bremen, eight thousand of the thirteen thousand dockworkers have been on strike since the 22nd, demanding wage increases. By the 23rd, the number of strikers had expanded to nearly eleven thousand, with seven thousand in Hamburg and nearly four thousand in Bremen. This is another large-scale strike movement in West Germany, following the first major post-war strike by 100,000 metalworkers in Hesse, West Germany, in September of this year.

The Hamburg and Bremen dockworkers' strike is in protest of the dock owners' refusal to meet the workers' demands and the right-wing union leadership's attempt to compromise with the owners. The workers are demanding a wage increase of 23 pfennigs per hour, raising the daily minimum wage to 14 marks and 7 pfennigs.

After the strike began, capitalists, right-wing union leaders, and the Bonn authorities united to carry out terror and repression against the workers and adopted various shameless means in an attempt to split the workers' unity, but all of these failed. The Bremen authorities dispatched six hundred police officers to attack striking dockworkers in front of the city hall, injuring many workers with clubs and arresting seven. Several dock companies also attempted to hire unemployed workers to break the strike, but the unemployed workers supported the striking dockworkers and refused to work for the dock companies, thus foiling this conspiracy. The West German union's right-wing leadership attempted to sell out the workers and sabotage the workers' strike, which only aroused the anger of the striking workers. The Hamburg strikers formed their own strike committee and declared it the only organization authorized to negotiate with the owners on their behalf. On the 23rd, five thousand striking workers in Hamburg held a meeting under the auspices of the strike committee, and all the workers expressed their determination to fight until their demands are met.

    西德大港口汉堡和不来梅
    万余码头工人罢工
    反动当局与右翼工会头子破坏失败
    【新华社二十六日讯】汉堡消息：西德北部两个最大的港口——汉堡和不来梅的一万三千名码头工人中，有八千名工人自二十二日起举行了要求增加工资的罢工。到二十三日，罢工人数已扩大到将近一万一千人，在汉堡有七千人，在不来梅有将近四千人。这是继今年九月西德黑森州十万五金工人举行战后第一次大罢工以来，西德又一次规模浩大的罢工运动。
    汉堡和不来梅码头工人的罢工是为了抗议码头资方拒绝工人的要求，抗议工会右翼领导机构企图对资方妥协。工人们要求每小时增加工资二十三芬尼，把每天最低工资提高为十四马克七芬尼。
    罢工开始以后，资本家、右翼工会领导机构和波恩当局就联合起来对工人施行恐怖镇压，和采取了种种无耻手段，企图分裂工人团结，但是这些都遭到了失败。不来梅当局出动了六百名警察在市政厅前袭击罢工的码头工人，他们用木棒殴伤工人多名，并且逮捕了七名工人。有几家码头公司还企图雇用失业工人来破坏罢工，但是失业工人支持罢工的码头工人，拒绝为码头公司工作，这项阴谋因而失败。西德工会右翼领导机构企图出卖工人，破坏工人的罢工，结果更引起了罢工工人的愤慨。汉堡罢工工人自己组成了罢工委员会，并宣布这是唯一有权代表他们与资方谈判的组织。二十三日，汉堡五千罢工工人在罢工委员会的主持下举行了大会，全体工人表示决心斗争到他们的要求得到满足为止。
