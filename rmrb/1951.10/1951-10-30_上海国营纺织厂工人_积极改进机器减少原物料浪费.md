Shanghai state-owned textile factory workers are actively finding ways to improve machines and reduce waste of raw materials. After workers at the Shanghai No. 17 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory successfully改造 (gaizao - transform) the small rollers on the carding machine, they can increase operating time by 240 hours per month and save more than 100 pounds of wool. Jin Wenfu and Fan Jinxiu, mechanics at the factory, devised a method of opening fifteen grooves in the leather board of the sliver rubbing machine to prevent uneven slivers and reduce waste. In order to save raw materials, Bao Zhiqi, a worker at the No. 1 Factory of the China Silk Textile Factory, only rocked in one inch when he opened the knots into the steel buckle (generally consuming eight to thirteen inches), thus saving approximately 490,000 yuan per year. The iron workshop of the Shanghai No. 12 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory utilizes a large amount of scrap iron to transform it into weaving machine parts.

    上海国营纺织厂工人
    积极改进机器减少原物料浪费
    上海棉纺织厂工人纷纷设法改进机器，减少原物料浪费。国营上海第十七棉纺织厂职工改造梳毛机上的小滚筒成功后，每月即可增加开车时间二百四十小时，节省羊毛一百多磅。该厂机工金文甫和范金秀两人，设法在搓毛条的皮板上开了十五条槽子，防止了毛条不匀的毛病，使浪费减少。中国蚕丝纺织厂第一厂工人包志其为了节省原料，在他把结子开进钢扣时，只摇进一英寸（一般须消耗八到十三英寸），这样，每年约可省四十九万余元。国营上海第十二棉纺织厂铁工部利用大量废铁，改制成织机零件。
