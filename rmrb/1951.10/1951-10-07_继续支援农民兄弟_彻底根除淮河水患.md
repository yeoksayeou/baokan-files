    Continue to Support Our Farmer Brothers
    Completely Eradicate the Huai River Flood
    In April of this year, we, a group of drivers and mechanics, were transferred from Tianshui, Northwest China, to the Shimantan area of the Huai River to participate in the Huai River harnessing project. Upon arriving in Shimantan, we saw tens of thousands of farmer brothers, working like shuttles, some carrying earth, others piling it up. If it weren't for the care and love of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for the people, and their determination to eradicate the Huai River flood, there wouldn't be such a great undertaking! Seeing the hardworking spirit of the farmer brothers, the work enthusiasm of us technicians was even higher. We worked day and night. We operated loaders, scrapers, and rollers, working more than twelve hours a day, sometimes even sixteen hours. During tense work periods, the dust that flew up obscured the sky, and we couldn't see people across from us, but we still worked hard. When the machinery broke down, we rushed to repair it at night, so as not to hinder the progress of the work. With the efforts of tens of thousands of laborers and the cooperation of our machinery, the engineering task was completed in a very short period of time.
    While working in Shimantan, Chairman Mao remembered us and sent a comfort delegation to visit us, and a film projection team showed us movies, which filled our hearts with gratitude.
    After the construction of the Shimantan Reservoir was completed, we went to the Banqiao Reservoir and continued to complete the dam construction project. Now the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project has been successfully completed. As we continue to carry out the next phase of the project, we will continue to work harder, continue to support our farmer brothers, eradicate the Huai River flood, so that the vast number of farmer brothers on both sides of the Huai River can live and work in peace and contentment from now on.

    继续支援农民兄弟
    彻底根除淮河水患
    我们这批驾驶工人和修理工人，在今年四月间，由西北天水调到淮河石漫滩，参加了治淮工作。一到石漫滩，就见到几万农民弟兄，像穿梭一样，抬土的抬土，堆土的堆土。要不是中国共产党和毛主席这样的关怀和爱护人民，决心根除淮河水患，那里会有这样的伟大事业！看到农民弟兄努力工作的情景，我们技术工人们的工作情绪就更高了。我们不分昼夜地干活。我们操纵着装土机、铲运机、滚压机，每天工作十二小时以上，有时甚至工作到十六小时。在工作紧张时，飞扬起来的灰土遮蔽了天日，对面看不见人，但我们仍然紧张工作。机械发生故障时，在夜间我们也赶着修理，使不妨碍工作的进展。在数万民工的努力和我们的机械的配合之下，在很短的时期以内，就完成了工程任务。
    在石漫滩工作的时候，毛主席怀念着我们，派了慰劳团来慰问我们，又有电影放映队给我们放映电影，使我们内心充满了感激。
    石漫滩水库修建完成后，我们又到了板桥水库，继续完成了筑坝工程。现在第一期治淮工程已经胜利完成；在继续进行下期工程时，我们仍将加倍努力，继续支援农民兄弟，根除淮河水患，使淮河两岸的广大农民弟兄，从此安居乐业。
