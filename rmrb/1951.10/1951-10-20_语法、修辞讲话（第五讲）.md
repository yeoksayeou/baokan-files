Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 5)
Sixth Section: Incomprehensible

Just incomprehensible. The following examples are either due to inappropriate word choices, playing with words, or incorrect expressions, resulting in obscure meanings. However, upon careful examination, the author's true intention can still be guessed.

(1) At the recent Ministry of Railways National Engineering Conference, Minister Teng guaranteed that by the end of this year, the existing lines, including the Yuehan, Zhegan, and Longhai lines' Hai (zhou) Bao (ji) section, Jinghan, etc., would be completed. (Periodical)
(2) They understood resistance from this kind of pain. (Newspaper)
(3) Comrades! You are the implementers of Chairman Mao's correct policies and the pioneers of the new Yellow River construction. (Manuscript)
(4) But it is a pity that her attitude towards revolutionary work is limited to enthusiasm. (Periodical)
(5) Although these two plans are both national construction projects in themselves, they are extremely different in nature. Therefore, it is predetermined that one of these two movements will succeed, and the other will fail. (Periodical)
(6) Elementary school physical education materials should be determined based on the actual situation of elementary schools. Otherwise, the materials will become aimless and even produce the opposite effect. (Periodical)

(1) Since they are "existing," they must have been "completed" long ago. "Completed" should be changed to "repaired." Also, placing "Jinghan" at the end risks being misunderstood as a section of the Longhai Railway, so it should be moved before "Yuehan." (2) "Understood resistance" is very ambiguous. Does it mean understood the importance of resistance or understood how to resist? It should be said, "Learned to resist." (3) "Pioneers" can only mean "people with advanced ideas." It should be said, "The vanguard of the new Yellow River construction." (4) It probably means "She relies only on enthusiasm for revolutionary work." (5) Using "in themselves" and "in nature" for contrast is very unclear. It would be better to say, "Although the two are national construction plans..." In addition, the previous phrase says "two plans," while the following phrase says "two movements." "Movement" is not the same as "plan," so "plan" should still be used. "Predetermined" is unnecessary, as there won't be "post-determined." The word "的" in the second clause is unnecessary. (6) The positive effects weren't mentioned, so what does "the opposite effect" refer to?

(7) Cotton is a very important issue that was not handled well before. Now, the conditions for doing a good job in this work are all in place. (Periodical)
(8) "Current Affairs Talk" was changed from one article to three independent short pieces to expand the scope of the talk. (Periodical)
(9) From 1949 to 1950, the main focus of industrial policy in Northeast China was to restore and strengthen the foundation for industrial development. In the two to three years, it can exceed the level of the puppet Manchuria. Currently, it has reached at least one-third or more than one-half of the level. (Periodical)

(7) "Cotton" cannot be "handled well," nor can "issues" be "handled well." The subject of this sentence cannot be "cotton," but only some work related to cotton, such as "promoting cotton planting," "increasing cotton production," or "improving cotton seeds," etc. It should be clarified, and "issue" should be changed to "work." (8) The nature of "one article" is not clear enough. It would be better to change it to "from a comprehensive article..." (9) Readers must read it a second time to know that "level" at the end of the sentence refers to "the level of puppet Manchuria." It should be changed to "Currently, it has reached one-third or even more than one-half of this level."

(10) Visiting the fire sawmill and forest light railway in Dailing was the return journey of my trip. (Periodical)
(11) They are poor. The endless exploitation and oppression of the past reactionary regime and feudal gangs, accumulated over a long period of time, prevented them from turning over. (Periodical)
(12) Rewards for engineers, technicians, and staff in enterprises are generally only given when the quarterly or monthly production plan is overfulfilled, and costs are reduced in terms of output. (Manuscript)
(13) Some countries use basketball as an important training program for air force soldiers. One of the reasons for adopting it is the effect that eye training can achieve. (Periodical)
(14) Artists used to be treated with contempt, but now they are warmly favored. Between this contempt and favor, they experience the warmth of humanity. (Periodical)
(15) Old ladies from sixty to ninety-nine years old were specially allowed to ride in cars to participate in the parade. (Periodical)
(16) The color characteristics of murals in this period are mostly stone blue, malachite green, ochre red, and black-and-white original color contrast, more than intermediate color immersion. (Document)

(10) How can "visiting" be a "return journey"? The author means to say "...was something I planned to do on the way back." (11) "The accumulation of long periods of years" is unclear here, and the sentence itself is incomprehensible. It should be changed to "...the feudal gangs' years of exploitation and oppression..." (12) "Reduced costs in terms of output" is incomprehensible, probably meaning "calculated based on output, reduced costs." "得" cannot correspond to the preceding "只是". “得” should be changed to "才." This sentence also has ambiguity: (A) They are rewarded only when they "overfulfilled the production plan" and "reduced costs." (B) They are rewarded if either of the two is true. If it is (A), it should be said, "Only when the quarterly...is completed, and calculated based on output, costs are reduced, will they be rewarded." If it is (B), "并且" should be changed to "或者." (13) The second clause should be changed to "One of the reasons is that using basketball to train eyesight has very good effects." (14) "Between contempt and favor" is somewhat incomprehensible. It would be better to delete it and change the following to "They then experience the warmth of humanity." If "就在……之间" is retained, the last five characters should be changed to "the cold and warmth of human relationships." I don't know if this is the author's original intention. (15) From the literal meaning, it seems that those under fifty-nine and over one hundred years old do not have the right to participate in the parade by car. The author probably means "over sixty years old." (16) The incomprehensibility of this sentence is probably due to incorrect punctuation. This change may be in line with the original meaning: Cancel the comma after "ochre red," add a comma after "black and white," and cancel the comma after "contrast" (also cancel the comma after "characteristic" and change "多为" to "为多用").

Fundamentally incomprehensible. The degree of incomprehensibility of the following sentences is even higher. Some, the reader can guess, but cannot decide if the guess is correct. Some, it's simply impossible to guess.

(17) China's hydropower resources are great. According to different estimates, power generation may reach one hundred million kilowatts. (Periodical)
(18) In the exchange of experience and mutual learning, the great example of Soviet women encourages the experience and lessons of the liberation of Chinese women. (Periodical)
(19) But without possessing the necessary rich experience in revolutionary practice to enrich their social struggle experience, that is, without a firm stand, it is impossible to absorb the depth and breadth of viewpoints and methods. (Newspaper)
(20) Lu Xun's suspicion of the 1911 Revolution and even the May Fourth Movement is one thing, and the historicity of Lu Xun's thought after the May Fourth Movement is another. (Newspaper)
(21) We must understand whether we are fighting hard against an unreasonable life or settling for an unreasonable and empty rule, only seeing the difficulties in front of us and not having the courage to fight against difficulties, not seeking to improve the lives of the broad masses of people, but clinging to the empty illusion of personal stability. (Newspaper)
(22) Therefore, in history teaching, we should treat it as a scientific experiment. A predetermined historical engineering design must also be verified for its authenticity in constant testing. (Newspaper)
(23) Forcibly planting fruitless results on Chinese history upside down and sketching historical figures with circular masks. (Newspaper)

(17) Is one hundred million kilowatts one estimate among the various "different estimates," or is it an average figure? (18) How can "experience" and "lessons" be "encouraged"? Moreover, "the lessons of the liberation of Chinese women" is also incomprehensible. (19) What kind of "rich experience" is used to "enrich social struggle experience"? The "depth and breadth" of "viewpoints and methods" is incomprehensible. "Absorbing depth and breadth" is even more incomprehensible. (20) How can "the 1911 Revolution and even the May Fourth Movement" be the object of suspicion? The "historicity of Lu Xun's thought" is even more unknown. (21) "Empty rule," "seeking to improve the lives of the people," and "clinging to illusions" are all inexplicable. Moreover, this sentence is not finished. It started with a "A or B" structure, but there is no echo below. It is an incomplete sentence. It should say "...understand that we should fight against...and should not..." (22) "Historical engineering design" is an absurd coinage. The whole sentence is also unknown. If the second comma is removed, the structure is slightly clearer, but still incomprehensible. (23) The "planting fruitless results on…upside down" and "circular masks" in (23), I'm afraid no one besides the author would understand.

Omission causes incomprehension. Writing should be concise, but there are limits to conciseness. Too much omission makes it impossible to understand. For example:

(24) It is best to use a group format. Individual production capital is weak, tools and technology are insufficient, and labor and capital cannot be combined. (Book)
(25) But it is necessary to prevent the problems of propaganda work being separated from organizational work and key areas being separated from general areas, which have already occurred in some areas. (Book)

(24) "Labor and capital" refers to "farmers with labor and farmers with capital." (25) "Key areas and general areas" refers to "key disaster areas and general disaster areas." These abbreviations may be quite popular in certain circles, but their meanings are very unclear and easily lead to misunderstandings. They should not appear in writing.

Incomprehensible translations. When translating foreign texts, one must accurately convey the meaning of the original work while trying to preserve the original style and spirit. Therefore, we cannot demand that translations be as fluent as general writing. But no matter what the article, it can't be considered as being overly demanding to expect that people can understand it. If a translation is so obscure that it is impossible to read, then faithfulness to the original cannot be used as an excuse. In fact, there are incomprehensible examples everywhere in today's translations. Let's just look at a few sentences:

(26) Poor ore can make it rich, and dense factories exist precisely for this purpose. (Periodical)
(27) Naturally, it is more difficult to obtain products from these places than from usually cultivatable land. However, this can always be supplied in the same way. (Periodical)
(28) It is not without reason to remove this mask disguised by American pastors in China. (Periodical)

(26) How can "poor" ore become "rich"? What are "dense factories"? It's really hard to understand. It turns out to be "Low-grade ore can be made excellent, and factories specifically for refining this ore already exist!" (27) Since it is "more difficult," how can it be "supplied in the same way"? It turns out to be "However, it can still be done!" (28) What did this mask originally look like? And what has it been "disguised" as by American pastors? It turns out to be "Tear off the mask of American missionaries in China!"

(29) The earth's crust contains a large number of precipitates of magnesium and beryllium, these future metals. (Periodical)
(30) In those biographies that are devoted to this writer, whether the biography itself is novelistic, Mark Twain's difficult and evidence-revealing life, for that "always optimistic Yankee" who got a glamorous career and a happy marriage, provided documentary and mocking information. Later, becoming a literary businessman, he went bankrupt. However, he pulled himself out of difficult circumstances and finally found a stable position in American bourgeois society. (Periodical)

(29) "Future metals" is baffling. It should be said, "metals of the future era," preferably translated as "increasingly important metals." Metals also do not have "precipitates"; it is a mistranslation of "mineral deposits." (30) This paragraph is simply incomprehensible. The correct translation should be: "In Mark Twain's biography and biographical stories, this writer's life, filled with suffering and change, only provides material for creating myths. The protagonist of this myth is a thoroughly optimistic Yankee who found a good career, married a good wife, ran a literary (publishing) business, went bankrupt, but gloriously passed this test and restored his brilliant position in American bourgeois society." Mistranslations involve the translator's foreign language cultivation, which is beyond the scope of this talk. We will not say more. But we must make a request on behalf of the vast number of readers to some translators: It doesn't matter if the translation is difficult to understand (it's naturally better if it's easy to understand), but be sure to make it understandable.

    语法、修辞讲话（第五讲）
      吕叔湘  朱德熙
    第六段  费解
    只是费解。  下面的例子或是因为选择的词汇不恰当，或是因为耍弄字眼，或是因为表达方式不正确，结果语意晦涩不明，但仔细追究，作者的真意还可以猜得出来。
    （一）最近举行的铁道部全国工务会议，滕部长保证在今年年底前，完成旧有各线，包括粤汉、浙赣、陇海的海（州）宝（鸡）段、京汉等。（期）
    （二）他们从这种痛苦里懂得了反抗。（报）
    （三）同志们！你们是毛主席正确政策的执行者，是新黄河建设的前进者。（稿）
    （四）但可惜她对待革命工作就只限于热情。（期）
    （五）这两个计划虽然在本身上同是国家的建设，但在本质上却有极大的不同，因此便先天注定了这两种运动的一必成功，一必失败。（期）
    （六）小学体育教材是要根据小学的实际情况来决定，否则教材就会变成无的放矢的材料，甚至产生相反的作用。（期）（一）既然是“旧有的”，当然早已“完成”。“完成”应改做“修复”。又“京汉”放在最后，颇有误解为陇海路一段的危险，应移在“粤汉”前。（二）“懂得了反抗”很含混，是懂得了反抗的重要，还是懂得了如何反抗？该说“学会了反抗”。（三）“前进者”只能是“思想前进的人”的意思，该说“建设新黄河的先锋队”。（四）恐怕是“她做革命工作只凭热情”的意思。（五）用“本身上”和“本质上”对比，很不清楚，不如说“二者虽然都是国家的建设计划……”。此外，前面说“两个计划”，后面又说“两种运动”，“运动”跟“计划”不是一个东西，应仍用“计划”。“先天”不必说，因为不会有“后天注定”。第二分句的“的”字不需要。（六）前面没有提到正面的作用，那么“相反的作用”指什么？
    （七）棉花是一个很重要的问题，以前没有作好。现在作好这一工作的条件都具备了。（期）
    （八）时事漫谈由一篇改为三个独立的短篇，以扩大漫谈的范围。（期）
    （九）从一九四九到一九五○年东北工业的方针主要是恢复与壮大工业发展的基础，二三年期间可以超过伪满的水平，目前起码已达到三分之一或二分之一以上的水平了。（期）（七）“棉花”不能“作好”，“问题”也不能“作好”。这句话的主语不能是“棉花”，只能是关于棉花的一些工作，例如“推广植棉”“增产棉花”“改良棉种”等等，应该点明，同时把“问题”改做“工作”。（八）“一篇”的性质不够明白，不如改为“由综合性的一篇……”。（九）读者必须看第二遍才能知道句末的“水平”就是指“伪满的水平”。应改为“目前已达到这个水平的三分之一甚至二分之一以上了”。
    （十）到带岭参观火锯厂和森林轻便铁路是我这次旅行的归途。（期）
    （十一）他们穷，过去反动政权与封建帮会无尽止的榨取与剥削，长时期年月的累积，使他们翻不过身来。（期）
    （十二）企业中之工程师、技师、职员等的奖励，一般只是在按季或按月生产计划超额完成时，在产量上减低了成本时，得予以奖励。（稿）
    （十三）有的国家把篮球运动作为训练空军战士的重要项目，目力训练所能得到的效果就是被采用的原因之一。（期）
    （十四）艺人们过去一贯遭白眼，如今却受到人们热切的青睐，就在这白眼与青睐之间，他们体味着人间的温暖。（期）
    （十五）从六十岁到九十九岁的老太太被特许坐着车子参加游行。（期）
    （十六）这时期壁画用色特征，多为石青、石绿、赭红、及黑白本色对照，多于间色浸染。（件）（十）“参观”怎么会是“归途”？作者的意思是说“……是我预定在归途中要做的事”。（十一）“长时期年月的累积”在这里意思不明，这句话本身也费解。应改为“……封建帮会长年累月的榨取与剥削……”。（十二）“在产量上减低了成本”费解，大概是“依产量核算、减低了成本”的意思。“得”跟前面的“只是”不能呼应，“得”应改为“才”。这句话还有歧义：（甲）“超额完成了生产计划”，同时“减低了成本”，才予以奖励，（乙）二者有一即予以奖励。如果是（甲），应说“只有当按季……完成，并且依产量核算，减低了成本的时候，才予以奖励”。如果是（乙），应把“并且”改为“或者”。（十三）第二分句应改做“原因之一是用篮球来训练目力有很好的效果”。（十四）“白眼与青睐之间”有些费解，不如删去，把下面改为“他们这才体会到人间的温暖”。如果保留“就在……之间”，末五字应改为“人情的冷暖”。不知道这是否作者的原意。（十五）从字面上看，好像五十九岁以下跟一百岁以上的都没有坐车参加游行的权利。作者的意思大概是“六十岁以上的”。（十六）这句话费解大约是因为标点有误。这样改过也许合于原意：“赭红”后的顿号取消，“黑白”后加逗号，“对照”后的逗号取消（“特征”后面的逗号也取消，“多为”改做“为多用”）。
    根本不可解。  底下的例句的费解程度更高。有些，读者可以猜测，但是无法决定猜得对不对；有些，简直不能猜测。
    （十七）中国的水力资源是伟大的，根据不同的估计，发电可能到一亿千瓦。（期）
    （十八）在交流经验与互相学习中，苏联妇女的伟大榜样鼓励着我们中国妇女解放的经验与教训，（期）
    （十九）但是在革命实践中没有具备必需的丰富经验，以充实自己的社会斗争经验，即没有坚定的立场，吸收不了观点方法的深度与广度。（报）
    （二十）鲁迅对辛亥以至“五四”的怀疑是一件事，而“五四”以后鲁迅思想的历史性又是一件事。（报）
    （二一）我们要明白我们向不合理的生活艰苦作战，还是安于不合理的空虚统治，只看到自己眼前困难重重，而没有勇气去向困难斗争，不向广大人民生活求改善，而贴服于个人安定的空虚幻想。（报）
    （二二）因此在历史教学之中，我们应该作为科学的实验去看待，预定好了的历史工程设计，还要在不断的试验中，检证它的真实性。（报）
    （二三）生硬地对中国历史倒栽以无花之果，对历史人物勾画以循环脸谱。（报）（十七）一亿千瓦是各种“不同的估计”中的一种估计，还是一个平均数字？（十八）“经验”与“教训”怎么能受“鼓励”？而且“中国妇女解放的教训”也费解。（十九）用以“充实社会斗争经验”的“丰富经验”是什么经验？“观点方法”的“深度与广度”不可解，“吸收深度与广度”更不可解。（二十）“辛亥以至五四”如何可以作怀疑的对象？“鲁迅思想的历史性”更不知是什么意思。（二一）“空虚统治”“向人民生活求改善”“贴服于幻想”都莫名其妙。而且这句话没有说完，一开头用了一个“甲还是乙”的结构，下面却没有呼应，是一个残缺的句子。应该说“……明白我们应该向……作战，不应该……”。（二二）“历史工程设计”造语荒诞，整句也不知是什么意思，如果把第二个逗号去掉，结构略微清楚一些，但仍不可解。（二三）的“倒裁以无花之果”“循环脸谱”，恐怕除了作者以外，不会有第二个人懂得。
    省略引起费解。  写文章要简炼，但简练也有限度，省略过多，让人看不懂也不行。例如：
    （二四）以小组形式为最好，单独个人生产资本微弱，工具技术不足，不能使劳资有无结合起来。（书）
    （二五）但必须防止某些地区已经发生的宣传工作与组织工作脱节，重点与一般脱节的毛病。（书）（二四）“劳资有无”是指“有劳动力的农民与有资本的农民”，（二五）“重点与一般”是指“重点灾区与一般灾区”。这些略语也许在某一圈子里已相当流行，但是意义很不显豁，容易引起误解，都不应该见于文字。
    费解的翻译。  翻译外国文字的时候，一方面要准确地传达原作的意思，一方面还要尽量保存原作的风格和精神。因此我们不能要求翻译像一般文字那样流利。但是不管什么文章，让人看懂总不能算是苛求。如果一篇翻译，晦涩得令人无法卒读，那就不能以忠实于原作来作为借口了。事实上，在今天的翻译作品中，费解的例子到处皆是，我们随便举几句来看：
    （二六）贫乏的矿石可以使它富庶起来，密集的工场恰为这目的而存在。（期）
    （二七）自然，想从这些地方获得产物，比通常可开垦的土地显得更难一些。然而这总可以一样地供应的。（期）
    （二八）拔下这副被美国教士在中国伪装的面具，不是没有理由的。（期）（二六）怎样使“贫乏”的矿石“富庶”起来呢？“密集的工场”又是什么呢？真是不好懂。原来是“劣质的矿砂可以叫它变优良，专为提炼这种矿砂的工厂已经有了”！（二七）既然“难一些”，怎么又“可以一样地供应”呢？原来是“然而还是可以办得到的”！（二八）这个面具原来是什么样子呢？又被美国教士“伪装”成什么样子呢？原来是“撕下在中国的美国传教师的假面具”！
    （二九）地壳中包含着大量镁和铍这些未来金属的沉淀物。（期）
    （三十）在那些向这位作家专注的传记里，无论其传记本身是否有小说作风，而马克吐温的艰苦而证据昭然的生活，对于那个得着一种光鲜职业，一种美满婚姻的“始终乐观的花旗人”，供给了考证上的和笑柄上的资料。以后，变成一个文学买卖人，他破产了。不过又好好地从困难的环境自拔出来，终于在美国的资产阶级社会里找着了一个稳定的地位。（期）（二九）“未来金属”是叫人莫名其妙的，应该说“未来时代的金属”，最好是译做“日见重要的金属”。金属也不会有“沉淀物”的，是“矿藏”的误译。（三十）这一段话简直不知所云，正确的翻译应该是：“在马克吐温的传记以及传记性的故事里，这位作家的充满了苦难和变动的生涯，只供给〔人们〕制造神话的资料。这个神话的主人公是一个彻底乐观的花旗人，他找着了个好职业，娶了个好太太，经营文学（出版）事业，破了产，可是光荣地通过这个考验，恢复了他在美国资产阶级社会里的光辉地位。”错译牵涉到译者外国文修养的问题，这已超出这个讲话讨论的范围，我们不再多说。可是我们不得不代表广大的读者向某一些翻译工作者提出一个要求：译得难懂点还不要紧（容易懂自然更好），千万要让人有法子懂。
                （本段完，全文未完）
