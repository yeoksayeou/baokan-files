Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: British High Commissioner to the Federation of Malaya, Henry Gurney, was killed by the Malayan National Liberation Army on the morning of October 6th in the jungle 56 and a half miles from Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federation of Malaya.

The British colonial authorities admitted that the ambush by the Malayan National Liberation Army was meticulously planned in advance. Gurney's car was subjected to automatic weapons fire from all sides. The Malayan National Liberation Army suffered no losses in this ambush.

Gurney was appointed High Commissioner to the Federation of Malaya in July 1948, shortly after the British colonialists launched a war against the people in Malaya. For three years, he was the main executor of Britain's bloody policy of suppressing the Malayan national liberation movement.

    马来亚民族解放军击毙英驻马来亚高级专员
   【新华社十日讯】英国驻马来亚联合邦高级专员亨利·格尔奈六日上午在离马来亚联合邦首府吉隆坡五十六哩半的丛林中，被马来亚民族解放军击毙。
    英国殖民当局承认马来亚民族解放军的这一次伏击，事前计划得很周密。格尔奈所乘的汽车曾受到自动武器的四面射击。马来亚民族解放军在这一次伏击中，没有受到任何损失。
    格尔奈是在一九四八年七月间、英国殖民者在马来亚发动反对人民的战争后不久被任为驻马来亚联合邦高级专员的。三年来他是英国镇压马来亚民族解放运动的血腥政策的主要执行人。
