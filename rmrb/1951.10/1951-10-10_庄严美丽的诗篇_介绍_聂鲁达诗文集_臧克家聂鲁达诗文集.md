Solemn and Beautiful Poems
——Introducing "Selected Poems and Prose of Neruda" by Zang Kejia
Neruda's Selected Poems and Prose, translated by Yuan Shuipai, published by People's Literature Publishing House

This is a book of struggle, and also a book of peace; this is a book of solemnity, and also a book of beauty. The publication of this collection at this time is extremely timely. Against the entire era backdrop of opposing aggression and striving for peace, the significance and value of this collection of poems and prose are vividly highlighted. What makes us even more delighted is that, coincidentally, its author, Pablo Neruda, the great peace fighter and friend of the Chinese people, has come to the new China that he has long been concerned about. At this moment, we are printing his own works in Chinese characters as a gift to him, so that he can hear an echo of his own great and loud voice.

Although what is included in this collection is not all of the author's works, it can be said to be the essence of all his works. This collection is enough for us to clearly recognize an outstanding poet and a courageous fighter.

The theme of his works is only one, just as the goal of the struggle of people all over the world is only one, and that is peace and democracy. The enemy once threw bombs at the occasions where he recited his poems to the masses, which is enough to prove what kind of poems his poems are and what the power of his poems is.

When we read this collection, we marvel at the author's simplicity and are attracted by his breadth, depth, and meticulousness. His voice seems to have two sides: when he is angered by the ugliness and darkness of reality, his fiery verses gush out from his chest of righteous indignation, making us feel their heat and burning ourselves; when his poet's heart comes into contact with the people of peace and yearns for tomorrow, his voice becomes so gentle, so kind, so sincere, and so touching! His poems are motivated by a great and solemn motive, nurtured by sincere feelings, and also possess high artistic skills. It is political, but it is not a slogan; it is lyrical and beautiful, but it is not empty or flashy. Behind the great and magnificent poems stands a great and magnificent person. His fighting passion and practice give life to his poems.

In his own works, he often writes "I" as "we." In his opinion, "I" and "we" are the same. We can use his hatred for the reactionary and aggressive groups to measure his love for peaceful and democratic countries and the people of other countries. His thoughts, feelings, and actions are linked with the peace-loving people all over the world. He said, "I am one of them" because he is "by no means a bystander, but a fighter." He stood with the Spanish fighters who resisted Franco; during the suffering of Stalingrad, he posted the poems dedicated to Stalingrad on the walls of Mexico; when the members of the Chilean Congress declared their allegiance to their government, this poet, accused of "treason," accused the reactionary leader Videla of treason in indignant language. This is tantamount to dropping a bomb among this group of ugly people. This speech is actually magnificent verses. All the essays in this collection, especially "Responsibility to Life" and "Speech at the Celebration of the 150th Anniversary of Pushkin's Birth," are simply prose poems, surging with the poet's enthusiasm and resounding with majestic rhythms. Aphorisms are as dazzling as pearls.

His poems unfold a picture of life before our eyes. We follow him to the square to mourn the dead, listening to him singing with sorrow and anger:
	"But on that day, when the motherland is resurrected,
	You will leap from the soil and recover your lost blood." ("The Dead in the Square," page 18 of the original book) We follow the footsteps of his escape, worrying and rejoicing as we move from one strange and kind door to another. Watching his majestic body, "lying in the arms of the troubled motherland." Although in the dark night, he does not feel lonely. Because:
	"I am the people, countless people.
	There is an undeniable power in my voice,
	It can transcend silence,
	And breed in the darkness." ("The Fugitive," page 77 of the original book)
It is this power that makes his satire and rebuke of the dark forces justified, sharp, and profound; at the same time, in contrast, it is clear that
	The innocence and sincerity of hope in "Ode to Stalingrad" and "Salute to China" are so profound.

Many of his poems are narrative, yet they are all lyrical. His rich emotions, profound experiences, majestic spirit, and vivid images make his poems broad but not cluttered, long but not superficial. Reading a comprehensive poem like "Lumberjack, Wake Up" feels like one go, complete and harmonious.

His verses are extremely simple. Although it is in a prose-like form, without strict rhyme, the rhythm is distinct and the words are concise. For a great image like Stalin, he only used twenty-nine lines of poetry to shape him:
	"In the three rooms of the ancient Kremlin,
	Lives a man named Joseph Stalin.
	The lights in his room go out very late..." ("Lumberjack, Wake Up," page 112 of the original book)
There have been many poems praising Chairman Mao, but our friend
	— Neruda's following lines have to be considered very excellent:
	"Mao Zedong appeared in China's
	Vast and boundless
	Land that has suffered countless disasters,
	We saw his shoulders
	Bathed in the sunlight of dawn. ………………
	His footsteps are moving north,
	Reaching Yan'an, his clothes are full of dust,
	He advances solemnly." ("Salute to China," pages 155-156 of the original book)
His metaphors are used so well, like tender green leaves growing on the branches of life, making people surprised:
	"The Americas stretch out like a buffalo hide."
	"The river prays like a monastery."
	"My soul expands, filled with silence and the fragrance of resin."
He says peace is like "balm". He says that Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionary government of Greece are "as filthy as carpets." His technique arises from the content full of real life, and serves the content, making the content beautiful and complete.

This collection has special significance for Chinese readers and writers. This is not only because its content gives us great encouragement, nor only because its author repeatedly pays tribute to our Chinese people; I feel that what is expressed in his poems and prose is how a poet participates in actual political struggles, goes deep into life, and unites with the people, which is very enlightening to our readers, writers, and poets. Why haven't we produced great poems? Why can't our works often combine political and artistic qualities well? The key to answering these questions can be found in this collection. Neruda went from a "pure poet" to a fighter's post. When he was just a "pure poet," his voice was low and the response was weak; later, he became a fighter, and his poems became loud—because it is the bugle call of battle, this voice comes from his heart and also from the hearts of thousands of people. Therefore, even if he sings in a corner, it can resound throughout the world.

He is first and foremost an excellent fighter, and then an excellent poet.

We should also thank the translator of this book. Although it has gone through one hand, the poem is still the same—simple, solemn, beautiful, and the atmosphere of the poem is extremely strong. This is of course because the translator himself is a poet of the people, and his emotions have long been exchanged with the author's. He just translated what we felt but could not write out for us. This is not just a technical achievement, but a communion and resonance of the soul.

We warmly welcome the publication of this book. Chinese readers will receive great encouragement and strength from the solemn and beautiful poems and prose of this peace fighter.

### 庄严美丽的诗篇——介绍“聂鲁达诗文集”臧克家聂鲁达诗文集

    庄严美丽的诗篇
    ——介绍“聂鲁达诗文集”臧克家
    聂鲁达诗文集  袁水拍译    人民文学出版社出版
    这是一本战斗的书，也是一本和平的书；这是一本庄严的书，也是一本美丽的书。这本集子在目前问世，是极为合时的。在反对侵略、争取和平的整个时代背景上，鲜明地映衬出这本诗文集的意义和价值；使我们更欣慰的是：刚巧，它的作者——巴勃罗·聂鲁达，伟大的和平战士，中国人民的朋友，来到了他所久已关怀的新中国，在这时候，我们把他自己的作品，用中国文字印出来，作为一份礼物送给他，使他亲耳听到自己伟大而宏亮的声音的一个回响。
    包括在这个集子里的虽不是作者的全部作品，但可以说是他全部作品中的精华部分了。这个集子已经足够使我们去清楚地认识一个杰出的诗人、勇猛的战士。
    他的这些作品的主题只有一个，就像全世界人民斗争的目标只有一个一样，这就是和平与民主。敌人曾经在他向群众朗诵自己诗篇的场合，扔过炸弹，这就足以证明了他的诗是怎样的一种诗，他的诗的力量又是如何了。
    我们读这本集子的时候，惊叹于作者的纯朴而又为他的广阔、深刻、细致所吸引。他的声音仿佛有两个：当他为现实的丑恶、黑暗一面所激怒时，他火焰似的诗句便从义愤的胸怀中喷吐出来，使我们感到它们的炽烈而自己也燃烧了起来；当他诗人的心接触到和平的人民，想望到明天的时候，他的声音变得那么温柔，那么亲切，那么真挚，那么动人！他的诗，为一个伟大庄严的动机所鼓动，为真挚的情感所孕育，同时也具有高度的艺术技巧。它是政治的，但它却不是口号；它是抒情的、美丽的，但它却不空泛、浮华。伟大瑰丽的诗篇背后站着一个伟大而瑰丽的人。他的战斗热情与实践，给他的诗以生命。
    他在自己的作品里，常把“我”写做“我们”。在他看来，“我”与“我们”是一样的。我们可以用他对于反动侵略集团的憎恨去测量他对于和平民主国家和其他国家人民的热爱。他的思想、情感和行动是同全世界的和平人民连结在一起的。他说过，“我是他们之中的一个”，因为他“决不是一个旁视者，而是一个战士”。他和西班牙反抗佛朗哥的战士们站在一起；他在斯大林格勒受难的期间，把献给斯大林格勒的诗贴在墨西哥的墙壁上；在智利的国会议员们宣称效忠于他们政府的时候，这个被控以“叛国罪”的诗人用充满愤慨的语言控诉了反动的首领——魏地拉的叛国罪状。这无异在这群丑类中投下一颗炸弹。这个发言实际上是壮丽的诗句。这集子里的所有的散文，特别是“对生命的责任”、“在普希金一百五十周年诞辰庆祝会上的发言”，简直就是散文诗，里边澎湃着诗人的热情，响动着雄壮的节奏。警句像珍珠似地耀眼。
    他的诗在我们眼前展开生活的画卷。我们随着他到广场上去凭吊死者，听他怨伤而又愤怒地唱着：
    “但是到了那一天，当祖国复活的时候，
    你将从土中跃起，收复你失去的血。”（“广场上的死者”，原书第十八页）我们随着他逃亡的脚迹，担心而又欣喜地从一家陌生而又亲切的门口走到另一家。望着他雄壮的体躯，“躺在忧患的祖国的怀里”。虽然在黑夜里，但他却没有孤独感。因为：
     “我是人民，不可计数的人民。
    我的声音里有着无可怀疑的力量，
    它能够超越沉默，
    在黑暗中孳生。”（“逃亡者”，原书第七七页）
    就是这种力量使得他对黑暗势力的讽刺、斥责成为理直气壮，辛辣深刻；同时，对比起来，显见出
    “致斯大林格勒的情歌”，“向中国致敬”这些诗篇里希望的天真与诚挚是多么深长的。
    他有许多诗篇是叙事的，然而它们又都是抒情的。他的丰盛的情感、深刻的体验，雄伟的气魄，生动的形象，使他的诗博而不杂，长而不泛。像“伐木者，醒来吧”这样一篇包罗万象的诗，读起来只觉得一气呵成，完整和谐。
    他的诗句是极为朴素的。虽然是散文化的形式，没有严格的韵律，但节奏是分明的，字句是精炼的。对于像斯大林这样一个伟大形象，他只用了二十九行诗去塑造他：
    “在古老的克里姆林宫的三个房间里，
    住着一个人，他名叫约瑟夫·斯大林。
    他房间里的灯光熄得很迟。……”（“伐木者，醒来吧”，原书第一一二页）
    歌颂毛主席的诗歌已经有过许多，但我们的朋友
    ——聂鲁达的以下的几行，不得不算是很优秀的：
    “毛泽东出现在中国的
    纵横辽阔的
    遭受无数次灾难的土地上，
    我们看见他的肩膀
    沐浴在黎明的阳光里。………………
    他的脚步向北方行进，
    直达延安，他的衣服满是尘土，
    他庄严地前进。”（“向中国致敬”，原书第一五五——一五六页）
    他的比喻使用得那么好，像长在生活枝干上的嫩绿的叶儿一样，叫人惊喜：
    “亚美利加洲，像一张野牛皮似地伸展。”
    “河流像僧院似的祈祷。”
    “我的灵魂扩大，充溢着寂静和树脂的芬芳。”
    他说和平是“香膏”似的。他说蒋介石和希腊的反动政府“龌龊得像地毯一般”。他的技巧产生于充满现实生活的内容，而又为内容服务，使得内容美丽、完整。
    这个集子对于中国的读者和作家具有特别的意义。这不仅在于它的内容给予我们以莫大的鼓舞，也不仅因为它的作者向我们中国的人民再三致意；我觉得，他的诗文中所表现出来的作为一个诗人如何参加实际政治斗争，深入生活，和人民结合，对我国的读者们、作家们、诗人们是很有启发意义的。我们为什么还没有产生出伟大的诗篇？为什么我们的作品往往不能把政治性和艺术性很好地结合？这些问题可以从这本集子中得到解答的钥匙。聂鲁达从一个“纯诗人”走上了战士的岗位。当他仅是一个“纯诗人”的时候，他的声音是低沉的，反响是微弱的；后来，他变成了一个战士，他的诗也就响亮了起来——因为它是战斗的号角，这声音发自他的心中，也发自千万人民的心中。所以，即使他在一个角落里歌唱，也能响彻整个世界。
    他首先是一个优秀的战士，然后才是一个优秀的诗人。
    我们还应该感谢本书的译者。虽然经过了一道手，而诗还是原样的——朴素、庄严、美丽，诗的气氛极浓。这当然由于译者本人就是一位人民的诗人，他的情感和作者的早就有了交流。他不过把我们感觉到而写不出的给我们译了出来。这不只是技术上的一种成就，而是心灵上的一种交感与共鸣。
    我们热烈地欢迎这本书的出版。中国的读者将从这位和平战士的庄严美丽的诗篇与散文中得到巨大的鼓舞与力量。
