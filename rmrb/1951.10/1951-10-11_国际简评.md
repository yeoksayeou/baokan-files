International Brief Reviews

    The Victory of the Vietnamese People
    The fact that the Commander-in-Chief of the French invading forces in Vietnam, Tassigny, went to the United States and Britain to beg for assistance once again exposes that the French colonialists, under the heavy blows of the increasingly strong people's armed forces of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, already feel they are at the end of their road and want to rely on American and British imperialism to escape the dying struggle they are currently in in Vietnam.
    According to a commentary by Vietnam News Agency: in the past six years of war, the French aggressors have lost 175,000 men and 1,500 billion francs. It has become more difficult for France to replenish its increasingly weakened army. It is precisely for this reason that French politicians and generals have been sent to the United States to beg for more weapons and money.
    However, unfortunately, the American imperialists are currently suffering increasingly heavy blows from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers; similarly, the British imperialists are also deeply mired in the war to suppress the Malayan people. It is completely illusory for France to rely on American and British imperialists to save itself.
    The failure of the French aggressors in Vietnam is already doomed. Because the war waged by the Vietnamese people is a just war, with the support of the entire Vietnamese people and peace-loving people all over the world, and will surely win the final victory. Even if American and British imperialism give the French aggressors some "aid," it will never change this situation.
    The Despicable Behavior of the Norwegian Government
    The Norwegian government's anti-Soviet behavior has been extremely ugly and shameful in the recent large-scale destruction of the graves of Soviet soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the liberation of Norway and the relocation of Soviet soldiers' remains. The Soviet government has sent a note to the Norwegian government to condemn this and firmly insisted that the Norwegian government should immediately stop this ugly behavior.
    People know that the Norwegian government is a small servant of American imperialism and is following the United States in expanding its army and preparing for war. The Norwegian government's hasty relocation of the graves of Soviet soldiers, the liberators of Norway, is obviously for an extremely despicable purpose, which is to erase the Norwegian people's respect and memory of the Soviet Red Army, so as to drive them to fight against their liberators. However, the Narvik (a city in northern Norway) municipal authorities unanimously passed a notice to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing that the Norwegian people are willing to maintain and take care of the Narvik Soviet military cemetery. This is the Norwegian people's protest against the Norwegian government's ungrateful behavior.
    The Norwegian government must immediately stop its ugly and shameful behavior, otherwise it will inevitably arouse greater anger and universal contempt from the people of the world and the people of Norway.

    国际简评
    越南人民的胜利
    侵越法军总司令塔西尼赴美、英乞求援助，又一次暴露了法国殖民者在日益壮大的越南、老挝和柬埔寨的人民武装沉重打击下，已经感到自己穷途末路，想依赖美英帝国主义，以脱离目前在越南所处的垂死挣扎的困境。
    据越南通讯评论指出：法国侵略者在过去六年的战争中，已损失十七万五千人，一万五千亿法郎。法国要想补充它的日益削弱的军队已更加困难。正因为如此，法国的政客和将军们才被派到美国乞求更多的武器和金钱。
    但是，不幸的是，美帝国主义者目前正在受着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的日益沉重的打击；同样，英帝国主义者在镇压马来亚人民的战争中，也已深深陷入泥沼。法国要想依靠美英帝国主义者以挽救它自己，那完全是幻想。
    法国侵略者在越南的失败，是已经注定了的。因为越南人民所进行的战争，是正义的战争，有着全越南人民和全世界和平人民的支持，必将赢得最后的胜利。即使美英帝国主义给予法国侵略者以某些“援助”，也决改变不了这一形势。
    挪威政府的卑劣行为
    挪威政府的反苏行为，在最近大规模地破坏为解放挪威而牺牲的苏联士兵的坟墓和搬移苏联士兵遗体的事情上，表现得极为丑恶与可耻。苏联政府为此已照会挪威政府加以斥责，并坚决主张挪威政府应立即停止这种丑恶行为。
    人们知道，挪威政府是美国帝国主义的一个小仆从，并且正在追随美国进行扩军备战。挪威政府对挪威的解放者——苏联士兵坟墓草率迁移的行为，显然是怀了一个极为卑劣的目的，那就是要磨灭挪威人民对于苏联红军的尊敬与记忆，以便驱使他们对自己的解放者作战。但是，那维尔克（挪威北部的一个城市）市政当局一致通过了给挪威外交部的通知，表示挪威人民愿意维持并照管那维尔克的苏军战士公墓。这就是挪威人民对挪威政府忘恩负义行为的抗议。
    挪威政府必须立即停止它的丑恶的可耻行为，否则就必然要引起世界人民与挪威人民的更大愤怒与普遍唾弃。
