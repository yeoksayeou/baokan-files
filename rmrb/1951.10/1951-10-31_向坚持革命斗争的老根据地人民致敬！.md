    Thanks to Chairman Mao
    Hua Dong Old Revolutionary Base Area Representative Lu Jinghua
    Editor's Note: Comrade Lu Jinghua is the wife of the famous Communist Party member Zhang Tailei. Comrade Zhang Tailei gloriously sacrificed his life in the Guangzhou Uprising of 1927.

    Being able to come to Beijing to participate in the grand celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is the greatest honor of my life and the greatest comfort after experiencing all the bitterness of the world for twenty-five years!

    Twenty-five years ago, my husband, Comrade Zhang Tailei, sacrificed his life in the Guangzhou Uprising (1927). Since then, I have lived a very painful life under the white terror and economic hardship, raising Comrade Tailei's mother and the three children he left behind. I overcame all kinds of difficulties and raised the three children. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the children all inherited their father's aspirations and joined the revolution one after another. But my most beloved son, Comrade Zhang Yiyang, was killed by the Kuomintang bandit army in the Southern Anhui Incident. Tailei's mother also died of illness shortly after Yiyang's sacrifice.

    For twenty-five years, the Kuomintang reactionaries murdered my dearest two generations of relatives. However, in addition to the pain of losing my husband and son, my strong will for revenge has not diminished. I always believed that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese revolution would be victorious, and I would see this victory one day. Now, I have finally seen the victory of the Chinese revolution, seen the liberation of China, seen the emancipation of thousands of oppressed people, and seen the unparalleled strength of our great motherland, especially Chairman Mao. I have received warm hospitality from the Central People's Government and local people's governments, and I have enjoyed supreme glory. All of this has made me more deeply aware that without Chairman Mao's correct leadership, there would be no victory of the revolution, no everything in China today, and no everything I have today. I am able to dedicate my dearest people to the revolution and become a force in promoting the victory of the Chinese revolution. This is their own glory and my greatest glory. And all this glory is given by Chairman Mao. I sincerely thank Chairman Mao for the glory given to the Chinese people and myself.

    Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party
    We Have Confidence in Rebuilding a Beautiful Homeland
    Eyuwan Old Revolutionary Base Area Representative Ye Zhijian

    After the Kuomintang betrayed the First Domestic Revolutionary War, it created countless no-man's lands in the old Red base areas. I am one of the people who suffered disasters in this area.

    I am from Laoye Wan, Xin County, Henan Province, and I am fifty-two years old this year. I never thought I would come to Beijing. This time, I was elected by the masses as a representative of the old revolutionary base area of Eyuwan to participate in the National Day observation ceremony and meet Chairman Mao. This is truly my greatest glory. Recalling the past suffering days makes me extremely grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Really, without the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, there would be no peasant liberation and land distribution, and there would be no glory today.

    Before the First Domestic Revolutionary War, my family was a poor peasant family. Four brothers had only nine dou of land. Although they all participated in labor, they still could not support a family of seven.

    When the old society was forcing me to a dead end, the Communist Party came to the mountains to organize the masses and prepare to "fight the local tyrants and divide the land." This was truly the savior of the poor. I joined the Communist Party and, under the leadership of the Party, secretly organized the masses to prepare for an uprising. The landlords and bailiffs found out and set up the incense altar of the Red Spear Society (landlord armed forces) in my house, forcing me to flee to Huang'an County, Hubei Province, for half a year without being able to return home. On May 25, 1929, the Communist Party led the peasants of Qiliping and Baishaguan to hold a major uprising, overthrowing the local tyrants and evil gentry. I became the chairman of the township Soviet. The hateful Chiang Kai-shek bandit army carried out countless large-scale "encirclements," "suppressions," "garrisonings," "pursuits," and "blockades" against the old revolutionary base area of Eyuwan, as well as the horrific "cutting mountains," "burning mountains," and "searching mountains," creating vast no-man's lands in the Xin County, Lishan, and Huang'an areas, burning Lao Ye Wan and many other Wan to the ground, killing countless people and livestock. From 1932 to 1937, for six years, these places were completely uninhabited.

    The enemy captured me from the mountains and sent me to the puppet Huang'an County government, where I suffered all kinds of cruel torture by the enemy. The enemy forced me to admit that I was a Communist Party member and asked me to confess the secret organizations of the Party. I resolutely refused to bow to the enemy and never betrayed the revolution, always saying that I was a refugee from Luoyang. The enemy was unable to investigate, so they put me in the Huang'an County prison for three years, and then let me live in a reflection院 (rehabilitation center) for a year before releasing me.

    After I got out of prison, because the landlords and evil gentry still ruled my hometown, I couldn't go back, so I had to sell my labor in the Huang'an area. Although I didn't die, the enemy ruined my family. My family originally had eight people, but later only my eldest sister-in-law and I were left.

    In 1937, after the War of Resistance Against Japan began, the Kuomintang's massacre of the people in the old Dabie Mountain base area did not stop. It was not until after the fall of Wuhan in 1938 that the Kuomintang fled westward in a panic, and the old revolutionary base area of Eyuwan breathed a sigh of relief. The Kuomintang ran away, and the Japanese invaders did not dare to go deep into the Dabie Mountains. The Communist Party called on us to come back and rebuild our homes. At this time, Lao Ye Wan was truly desolate. The streets were overgrown with weeds, and trees as thick as bowls grew in the 屋? (corners of houses), we were truly like pioneers, using wooden sticks to clear the land and plant rice seedlings, rebuilding our homes. The hardship and difficulty are hard to describe in words.

    In 1941, the Guangxi troops of the Kuomintang bandit army invaded the Dabie Mountains again and massacred the people, saying that I was "in collusion with bandits," and looted my house again. I had to hide in the mountains again, living in caves and eating raw food, secretly carrying out the struggle. It was not until 1947, when the Liu-Deng army entered the Dabie Mountains, that I returned to Lao Ye Wan, married a wife, and had children. After the land reform, I was allocated seven dou of land and a plow, and I borrowed a thatched house from others to live in.

    The Kuomintang reactionaries caused too much disaster to the old revolutionary base area of Eyuwan. My house was burned three times. The population of my Wan (village), which was 430 before the revolution, was reduced to more than 100 (including newly born children). Thirty-two families were completely killed, and there was not a single young person from their teens to their twenties. They could not eat oil and salt all year round, and there were many sick people. Whether adults or children, it was really impossible to find a healthy person. It was not until after liberation that the people's government carried out many relief efforts, guaranteeing that no one would die and no one would flee famine, that people's lives gradually recovered.

    In the years of long-term destruction by the Kuomintang bandits, the revolutionary will of the people of our Lao Ye Wan was exceptionally strong. We have confidence that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we will rebuild a beautiful homeland in the no-man's land created by the enemy.

    向坚持革命斗争的老根据地人民致敬！
    感谢毛主席
    华东老根据地代表  陆静华
    编者按：陆静华同志是著名共产党员张太雷同志的爱人。张太雷同志在一九二七年广州起义时光荣牺牲。
    我这次能到北京参加中华人民共和国成立二周年的国庆盛典，这是我一生中最大的光荣，也是我二十五年来尝尽人间辛酸之后的最大安慰！
    二十五年前，我的丈夫张太雷同志在广州（一九二七年）起义中牺牲了。从这之后，我就带着太雷同志的母亲和他所遗下的三个孩子，在白色恐怖和经济窘迫之下，过着极痛苦的生活。我克服了种种困难，带大了三个孩子。到抗战初期，孩子们都继承了他们父亲的遗志，先后参加了革命。但我最心爱的儿子张一阳同志，却又在皖南事变中被国民党匪军杀害了。太雷同志的母亲，在一阳牺牲后不久，也病故了。
    二十五年来，国民党反动派杀害了我最亲爱的两代亲人。但，我在痛失夫、子之余，坚强的复仇意志，并未消沉。我始终相信，在毛主席领导之下，中国革命将会胜利，我总有一天会看到这胜利。现在，我终于看见了中国革命的胜利，看见了中国的解放，看见了千千万万被压迫人民的翻身，看见了我们伟大祖国的无比强盛，特别是看到了毛主席。我受到了中央人民政府和地方人民政府的热烈招待，享受了无上的光荣。所有这一切，使我更深刻地认识到：没有毛主席的正确领导，就没有革命的胜利，就没有今天中国的一切，也没有我今天的一切。我能把我最亲爱的人献给革命，成为推动中国革命胜利的一分力量，这是他们本人的光荣，也是我的最大光荣。而所有这一切的光荣，又都是毛主席所给予的。我衷心地感谢毛主席所给予中国人民和我本人的光荣。
    在毛主席和共产党领导下
    我们有信心重建美好家园
    鄂豫皖老根据地代表  叶志建
    国民党叛变了第一次国内革命战争以后，在红色老根据地造成无数无人区，我是在这种地区受过灾难折磨的一个人。
    我是河南新县老叶塆人，今年五十二岁。我从来也没想到会来北京。这次被群众选为鄂豫皖老根据地的代表，参加国庆观礼，见到了毛主席，这真是我的最大光荣。回想过去的苦难日子，使我万分感激共产党和毛主席。真的，没有毛主席和共产党的领导，就没有农民翻身分田，就不会有今天的光荣。
    在第一次国内革命战争前，我家是贫农，兄弟四人，只有九斗田，虽然都参加了劳动，还是养不了全家七口人。
    旧社会正逼得我走头无路的时候，共产党来到深山组织群众，准备“打土豪，分田地”。这真是穷人的救命恩人。我参加了共产党，在党的领导下，秘密组织群众，准备暴动。地主和保长知道了，把红枪会（地主武装）的香坛安在我家，逼得我逃到湖北黄安县半年不能回家。一九二九年五月二十五日，共产党领导七里坪和白沙关的农民举行大暴动，打倒了地主恶霸，我当了乡苏维埃主席。可恨蒋介石匪军，对鄂豫皖老根据地进行了无数次大规模的“围剿”、“清剿”、“驻剿”、“追剿”、“堵剿”及惨绝人寰的“砍山”、“烧山”、“搜山”，造成新县、礼山、黄安一带广大的无人区，把老叶塆和其他许多塆子烧得片瓦无存，人畜烧死杀死得不知多少。由一九三二年至一九三七年的六年时间，这些地方完全没有人烟。
    敌人从山中将我捕获送到伪黄安县政府，我受尽敌人酷刑摧残。敌人硬逼我承认是共产党员，并要我供出党的秘密组织。我坚决不向敌人低头，决不叛变革命，始终说我是洛阳的难民。敌人无法考查，就把我放在黄安县监牢里押了三年，又让我在反省院住了一年才放我回来。
    我出了监牢后，因为地主恶霸仍然统治着我的家乡，不能回去，只好在黄安一带卖工生活。我自己虽然没死，敌人却把我家害得家破人亡了。我家原来有八口人，后来只剩下我和大嫂两人。
    一九三七年，抗日战争开始以后，国民党对大别山老根据地人民的屠杀并未停止。直到一九三八年武汉失守之后，国民党才仓惶西逃，鄂豫皖老根据地才松了一口气。国民党跑了，日寇不敢深入大别山。共产党号召我们回来重建家园。这时的老叶塆，真是一片凄凉。街上长满了野草，屋?中长起碗样粗的树来，我们真像开天辟地一样，用木棍开地插秧，把自己的家园重建起来。艰难困苦，难以用言语来形容。
    一九四一年国民党匪军的广西部队，又侵入了大别山屠杀人民，说我“通匪”，把我家又抢了个空。我只好又隐蔽在山中，穴居生食，秘密进行斗争。直到一九四七年，刘邓大军进入大别山，我才又回到老叶塆，娶了老婆，生了孩子，土地改革后我分到七斗田和一张犁，借别人一间草房居住。
    国民党反动派给鄂豫皖老根据地的灾难太大了。我家的房子被烧过三次。我塆的人口，由革命前的四百三十人减少到一百多（连刚生的小孩包括在内）。有三十二家被杀绝了，十几岁到二十几的青年一个也没有，长年吃不到油盐，生病的特别多，无论大人小孩，真是找不出一个健康人。一直到解放以后，人民政府进行了多次的救济，保证不死人，不逃荒，人民的生活才逐渐恢复。
    在长期受国民党匪帮摧残的岁月里，我们老叶塆人民的革命意志是异常坚强的。我们今后有信心在毛主席和共产党的领导下，在敌人造成的无人区，重新建起美好的家园来。
