    To Comrade Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and all commanders, combatants, political workers, logistics personnel, and transportation personnel:
    On the great anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the people of the whole country fighting together in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends to you its warm greetings and congratulates you on your victory!
    In the past year, the heroic struggle of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side has achieved a great victory in annihilating more than 387,000 American and satellite troops, shattering the US imperialist plan to invade the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and then invade the Chinese mainland. It has inspired the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of Asia and the world with confidence and determination to oppose aggression and defend peace. The people of the whole world are watching you with unparalleled enthusiasm, and the people of China are supporting your victorious operations with enthusiastic movements to resist US aggression and aid Korea and with an ever-increasing movement to increase production and practice economy.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China congratulates all of you comrades for making persistent efforts to strive for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and for the victorious conclusion of the Korean anti-aggression war!
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
