You are our dearest comrades and brothers
A Letter from Karaslavov, Vice-Chairman of the Bulgarian Peace Committee, to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

Dear Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

The sincere people of the world are watching you with love, excitement, and joy, watching your heroic battles alongside the brave Korean People's Army. Even in my distant, small homeland of Bulgaria, you are talked about as the closest and dearest comrades and brothers. This is because you are not ordinary volunteers, you are not shedding your young blood in Korea for greedy motives and adventurism. Not long ago, Bulgarian newspapers published a letter from a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier in Korea, in which he simply and concisely talked about the profound moral motives that inspired him to go to the Korean battlefield. Our people, especially the youth, read this letter with excitement. Because the precious feelings for the fighting Korean brothers and the hatred for those who attempt to enslave the Korean people are the feelings of all Bulgarian patriots.

To Bulgaria, as to all other countries and all honest people, you are volunteer soldiers defending the cause of peace. Every patriot, wherever he is, understands that you are not only fighting for the happiness and prosperity of the hardworking Korean people. Because the enemy of the Korean people - the American and British imperialists - not only want to suffocate the Korean people with their bloody and predatory claws, but they also want to suffocate all other free and independent nations. Using the means already familiar to you, they are also trying to enslave the Bulgarian people. And the Bulgarian people, since being liberated by the great Soviet Red Army, and with the selfless material and spiritual assistance of the powerful Soviet Union, are building a new and happy life in their own country at an extremely rapid pace, following the wise instructions of the genius Stalin.

Dear Chinese People's Volunteer Army, this is why the Bulgarian people lovingly and joyfully regard you as the truly heroic defenders of world peace, as warriors and ardent patriots protecting mankind from the cannibalistic conspiracies of the American and British imperialists.

In the name of the Bulgarian people, in the name of Dimitrov's people, I extend warm fraternal greetings to you, the heroic warriors of peace and freedom, and wish you success and victory.

I extend warm and heartfelt thanks to you, the respectable sons and daughters of the noble Chinese people and the brave soldiers of the great Mao Zedong!

Vice-Chairman of the Bulgarian Peace Committee
Writer Georgi Karaslavov

### 你们是我们最亲爱的同志和兄弟  保加利亚和平委员会副主席卡拉斯拉渥夫给中国人民志愿军的一封信

    你们是我们最亲爱的同志和兄弟
    保加利亚和平委员会副主席卡拉斯拉渥夫给中国人民志愿军的一封信亲爱的中国人民志愿军！
    全世界真诚的人士带着热爱、兴奋和喜悦的目光看着你们，注视着你们和勇敢的朝鲜人民军并肩进行的英勇战斗。就是在遥远的、小小的我的祖国保加利亚，你们也是被当作最亲近、最亲爱的同志和弟兄谈论着。这是因为你们不是一般的志愿兵，你们并不是为了贪婪的动机和冒险主义而到朝鲜去流自己年轻的血。不久以前，保加利亚的报纸曾刊登了一位在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军战士的信，信中他简单而扼要地谈到了激励他到朝鲜战场上去的深刻的道义动机。我国人民，特别是青年，都以激动的心情读了这封信。因为对战斗着的朝鲜兄弟的珍贵感情，对企图奴役朝鲜人民的憎恨，是全体保加利亚爱国者的感情。
    对于保加利亚，像对于所有其他国家全体诚实的人们一样，你们是保卫和平事业的志愿军。每一个爱国者，不论他在那里，都了解你们不仅是为勤劳的朝鲜人民的幸福和繁荣而战。因为朝鲜人民的敌人——美英帝国主义者，不仅要用它的血腥的掠夺的脚爪窒息朝鲜人民，它还要窒息所有其余自由而独立的民族。借助着已为你们所熟谂的手段，他们也在企图奴役保加利亚人民。而保加利亚人民自被伟大的苏联红军解放，并在强大的苏联的无私的物质和精神帮助下，遵循着天才的斯大林的英明指示，正在以极快的速度在自己的祖国内建筑着新的幸福的生活。
    亲爱的中国人民志愿军，这就是为什么保加利亚人民热爱而欣喜地把你们看作是全世界和平的真正英勇的保卫者，看作是保护人类免遭美英帝国主义者吃人阴谋毒害的战士和热烈爱国者的缘故。
    我以保加利亚人民的名义，以季米特洛夫的人民的名义，向你们，和平与自由的英勇战士，致以热烈的兄弟敬礼，并祝你们成功和胜利。
    谨向你们，高贵的中国人民的可尊敬的儿女们和伟大的毛泽东的勇敢战士们，致以热烈、衷心的感谢！
    保加利亚和平委员会副主席
    作家乔治·卡拉斯拉渥夫（这封信的标题是编者加的）（附图片）
