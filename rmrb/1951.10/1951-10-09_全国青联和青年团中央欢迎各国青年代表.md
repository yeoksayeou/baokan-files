Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The All-China Youth Federation and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly held a welcoming meeting this afternoon to welcome the youth representatives of the people's observation delegations from various countries who participated in the National Day celebration ceremonies in our country. The foreign guests present included youth representatives from eleven countries, including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation and Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Qian Sanqiang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, Wu Han, Secretary-General, Chen Jiakang, Deputy Secretary-General, Li Chang and Rong Gaotang, Standing Committee Members of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Zhang Dazhong, Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Youth Federation, and Yang Bozhen, Secretary of the Beijing Committee of the Communist Youth League, attended the welcoming meeting. More than 800 young people from factories, rural areas, schools, government organs, and the armed forces participated in the welcoming meeting.

    The welcoming meeting was presided over by Yang Bozhen. Liao Chengzhi delivered a welcoming speech, first extending a warm welcome to the guests, and then recounted the great achievements of Chinese youth under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government in the patriotic production movement and the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Liao Chengzhi emphasized that the Chinese people and youth resolutely oppose the United States arming Japan, oppose the United States continuing to occupy Japan, and oppose the illegal Japanese peace treaty. We must stand together with the people of Asia and the people of the world to fight for smashing the US imperialist aggression plan and defending Asian and world peace.

    Soviet representative Zoteylavov said: The Soviet people and Soviet youth are joyfully watching the great achievements of the Chinese people and youth in building a new China. The victory of the Chinese people has made China a peace bastion in Asia. The unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and youth is a guarantee for smashing imperialist aggression.

    Polish representative Dadruez said: Polish youth love peaceful life and hate war instigators. We are very concerned about the struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea. Polish youth have suffered the pain of Hitler's fascism, and now seeing that US imperialism is stepping up its support for Japan and West Germany, it has strengthened its determination to defend peace.

    Vietnamese representative Huang Jun said: The struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the unity of youth all over the world shown in the World Youth and Students Peace Festival, the great power of the Chinese people seen during the National Day of the People's Republic of China, and Stalin's recent answer to reporters on the issue of atomic weapons have greatly encouraged the confidence of the Vietnamese people in their struggle. The Vietnamese people must redouble their efforts to drive French imperialism out of Vietnam.

    Free German Youth representative Bartel said: Seven days after celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I am very happy to meet with Chinese youth today, the second anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. German youth are bravely fighting against US imperialism, because we know that we are with the great Soviet and Chinese youth.

    Youth representatives from Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Burma, and Indonesia delivered speeches successively. They unanimously expressed their intention to strengthen the unity of youth and jointly strive to defend world peace.

    The meeting ended in the music of "March of the World Democratic Youth". After the meeting, the Youth Art Theater Children's Team performed entertainment programs.
