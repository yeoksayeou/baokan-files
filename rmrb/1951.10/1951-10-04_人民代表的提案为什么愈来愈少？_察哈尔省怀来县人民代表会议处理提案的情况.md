    Why are People's Representatives Submitting Fewer and Fewer Proposals?
    ——An Investigation into the Handling of Proposals by the People's Representative Conference of Huailai County, Chahar Province
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    The Huailai County People's Government in Chahar Province has achieved results in handling the proposals of the people's representatives. The county-level leading organs have spent a lot of effort in dealing with proposals. However, the number of proposals coming from the masses has been decreasing with each session. What are the reasons for this serious situation? After our investigation, we found that the main reason for the decrease in proposals is that the county's leading organs have not adopted a cautious and responsible attitude towards handling the proposals of the people's representatives.
    The third People's Representative Conference of Huailai County received more proposals than any previous conference. More than two months before the conference was held, the county's leading organs specifically issued a notice soliciting proposals, distributed proposal forms, and determined that cadres at all levels who were deeply involved in the "election" in various villages should widely collect suggestions and requests from the masses regarding the work of the People's Government. Before the opening of the conference, the county's leading cadres also organized a "Proposal Review Group" (later changed to the "Proposal Review Committee" after the conference opened) to be responsible for organizing the proposals sent from various places. A total of 381 proposals were received this time, which were organized and summarized by the "Proposal Review Group" into 97 items, classified as follows:
    Cadre style: 21 items
    Construction issues: 1 item
    Marriage issues: 1 item
    Property rights issues: 2 items
    Ethnic issues: 1 item
    Suppression of counter-revolutionary activities: 2 items
    Military, government, and civilian relations: 6 items
    Work on preferential treatment: 2 items
    Opinions on supply and marketing cooperatives: 7 items
    Culture, education, and health: 18 items
    Industrial and commercial burden and industrial and commercial management: 13 items
    Village financial expenditure: 2 items
    Agricultural tax burden: 3 items
    Agricultural production: 18 items
    Total: 97 items
    The table above shows that many proposals are major issues that the masses urgently need to resolve. Proposals such as water conservancy issues in agricultural production and unreasonable burdens of industrial and commercial taxes are very important. Regarding water conservancy issues, the masses in Beihaoying in the Sixth District raised a proposal regarding a water conservancy dispute with Jiangying Village in Zhuolu County. The clear water canal in Jiangying Village is close to Beihaoying, and the water in the clear water canal is never used up every year, but is wasted. The masses in Beihaoying proposed that if a 370-step-long canal were built to divert the water from the clear water canal, it could increase the irrigated area in Beihaoying Village by 700 to 800 mu. If watered once a year, each mu could increase grain production by 3 dou. Regarding industrial and commercial tax issues, representatives of the industrial and commercial sector proposed that more than 10 million yuan in taxes were collected from industrial and commercial households in the three towns of Huailai, Shacheng, and Xinbao'an during the summer industrial and commercial tax collection last year. In this regard, representatives of the industrial and commercial sector requested the People's Government to refund or make appropriate arrangements. These proposals should obviously be handled seriously.
    However, all proposals were not submitted to the People's Representative Conference for discussion. These proposals were only reviewed by the "Proposal Review Group" to put forward preliminary opinions on how to handle them, and then the Proposal Review Committee (that is, the "Proposal Review Group" before the conference) discussed them at the conference without being reviewed by the presidium. They were then compiled into a special booklet by the conference secretariat and distributed to various departments and villages. Only before the closing of the conference did a person in charge of the Proposal Review Committee give a simple answer to the representatives on all the proposals.
    After the closing of the Third People's Representative Conference, the departments of the County People's Government did not handle the proposals with a serious and responsible attitude. For nearly a year now, they have not conducted any inspections on the handling of the proposals, nor have they reported the handling of the proposals to the representatives. According to this investigation, among the 97 proposals, 52 have been handled, 29 have been answered, and 16 have not been handled. Regarding the 16 proposals that have not been handled, the relevant departments have not continued to find ways to deal with them. For example, regarding the proposal submitted by the representatives of the industrial and commercial sector on the overcollection of more than 10 million yuan in industrial and commercial taxes, the County People's Government wrote to the Commissioner's Office at that time, and the Tax Bureau of the Commissioner's Office replied that all the taxes had been transferred to the Provincial People's Government and could not be refunded. The County People's Government then relayed the reply from the Tax Bureau of the Commissioner's Office to the representatives of the industrial and commercial sector. For example, regarding the water conservancy dispute between Beihaoying and Jiangying Village, the Water Conservancy Bureau of the County People's Government sent people to Jiangying Village in Zhuolu County to handle it. However, they did not understand that the key to not resolving this water conservancy dispute was the historical contradictions between Beihaoying and Jiangying Village. Therefore, although they went to Jiangying Village twice to handle this issue, they did not resolve the issue. Another example is that the masses in Jiuzhuanghu Village proposed that Feng Zhien of the former CPC Chanan Prefectural Committee borrowed 441 jin of millet from the village, and it has been four years now, and it has not been returned. The masses in the village wanted the County People's Government to find a way to solve this problem. The County People's Government asked the Commissioner's Office for instructions, but because the Commissioner's Office did not reply, it was delayed.
    This kind of handling result of the proposals of the People's Representative Conference has already aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. The masses believe that "there is no point in making suggestions if they cannot be resolved!" For example, the masses in Beihaoying are extremely dissatisfied with the result of the County People's Government's handling of the water conservancy dispute between the village and Jiangying Village. Xu Shouyin, a farmer in the village, said, "Whatever the higher authorities say to do is right. It is useless to make suggestions about things that cannot be done. The dispute over the canal between us and Jiangying Village has been mentioned at the People's Representative Conference for a year, and it still cannot be resolved." Xu Shouyun's wife said, "The county representatives are also useless. Isn't it still impossible to resolve the suggestions made!" Yu Shenggui, a people's representative of Sangyuan Village and a member of the County Standing Committee, said, "The masses are disappointed (unwilling to make suggestions again) because the county does not resolve the suggestions we make." Zhang Chungong, a people's representative of Xinbao'an Town, also expressed great dissatisfaction when mentioning the issue of proposals. He said, "The masses make suggestions to ask the government to find ways to solve problems. Suggestions are made, but no one knows what the result is. Who will be willing to make suggestions in the future!"
    Since the Third People's Representative Conference, the county has paid even less attention to the proposals of the people's representatives. According to County Magistrate Guo, "We haven't thought about the issue of proposals since the Third Representative Conference." Therefore, the number of proposals has decreased with each session.
    The notices for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth People's Representative Conferences did not mention collecting proposals, and there was no one in charge of collecting proposals at the conference, nor was a "Proposal Review Committee" organized. The representatives temporarily put together a few proposals and handed them to the county magistrate, who simply answered them before the closing of the conference. Until now, the figures and drafts of the proposals of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Conferences cannot be found. All that is known is that there were more than 100 proposals for the Fourth People's Representative Conference of All Circles; the number of proposals for the Fifth People's Representative Conference of All Circles is unknown; and there were only five or six proposals for the Sixth People's Representative Conference of All Circles. As for the results of the handling of the proposals, it is naturally even less to be mentioned.
    So where did these proposals come from? According to the investigation, the proposals for the Fourth People's Representative Conference were temporarily put together by the representatives. For the proposals of the Fifth People's Representative Conference, we interviewed many conference staff, and they all replied, "I don't remember." The proposals for the Sixth People's Representative Conference were put together from five or six small pieces of paper and handed to the county magistrate on the night before the closing of the conference. Gu Wanyin, a people's representative of Qianjin Street in Xinbao'an, said, "The county holds representative conferences to arrange work. No one collects the proposals we bring, and there is no time to discuss them." Wang Shuzhen (female), a people's representative of Xinzhuangzi Village, brought a proposal from the masses in the village requesting the construction of a canal when she participated in the Sixth County People's Representative Conference. Because no one was in charge of the proposals, she did not know who to hand the proposal to, so she took it back.
    The problem is already very obvious. The reason why the number of proposals received by the People's Representative Conference of Huailai County is decreasing is entirely due to the lack of a serious and responsible approach to handling proposals.

    人民代表的提案为什么愈来愈少？
    ——察哈尔省怀来县人民代表会议处理提案的情况
    本报记者  朱  波
    察哈尔省怀来县人民政府处理人民代表的提案是有成绩的，县级领导机关曾为处理提案花费了不少的力量；但是来自群众中的提案，却一次比一次的减少了，这一严重情况的原因何在呢？经过我们的调查，发现提案减少的主要原因，是该县领导机关对处理人民代表的提案，没有采取慎重、负责的态度。
    怀来县第三次人民代表会议收到的提案，比历次人民代表会议的都多。在这次人民代表会议召开前的两个多月，县的领导机关就专门发出了搜集提案的通知，散发了提案纸，确定由当时深入各村进行普“选”的各级干部，广泛地搜集群众对人民政府各种工作的建议和要求。县的领导干部并在大会开幕前组织了“提案审查小组”（大会开幕后，改为“提案审查委员会”），负责整理各地送来的提案。这次共收到三百八十一件提案，经过“提案审查小组”整理归纳成九十七件，分类如下表：
    干部作风二十一件
    修建问题一件
    婚姻问题一件
    产权问题二件
    民族问题一件
    镇压反革命活动二件
    军、政、民关系六件
    优抚工作二件
    对供销社的意见七件
    文教卫生十八件
    工商业负担和工商管理十三件
    村财政开支二件
    农业税负担三件
    农业生产十八件
    共计九十七件
    上表显示，有很多提案都是群众迫切要求解决的重大问题。如农业生产方面的水利问题，工商税收负担不合理的问题等提案，都是十分重要的。在水利问题方面，六区北浩营群众提出了和涿鹿县姜营村的水利纠纷的提案。姜营村的清水渠紧靠北浩营，清水渠的水年年都用不完，却被白白地放走了。北浩营群众提出，如果修一道三百七十步长的水渠，把清水渠的水引过来，就可以使北浩营村增加七百至八百亩的水地，每年如果浇一次水，一亩地就可增产三斗粮食。在工商业税收问题方面，工商业界代表提出：去年征收夏季工商业税时，多征怀来、沙城、新保安等三镇工商户一千多万元税款。对此，工商业界代表要求人民政府退还或者作适当的处理。这些提案显然是应该认真加以处理的。
    但是所有提案都没有交人民代表会议讨论。这些提案仅仅经过“提案审查小组”整理后，提出处理的初步意见，然后就在大会上由提案审查委员会（即会前的“提案审查小组”）讨论，也没有经过主席团审查，就交给大会秘书处编印成专册，分发给各部门及各村。只是在大会闭幕前，才由提案审查委员会的一位负责人就所有提案向代表们作了简单的解答。
    第三次人民代表会议闭幕以后，县人民政府各部门也不是以认真负责的态度处理提案，到现在将近一年的时间，对提案处理的情形，没有进行过检查，提案处理的情况也没有向代表们报告。据此次调查，在九十七件提案中，已处理的五十二件，经过解答的二十九件，未处理的十六件。对没有处理的十六件提案，有关部门到现在也没有继续想办法处理。如对于工商业界代表所提的多征一千余万元工商税款的提案，当时县人民政府曾写信给专署，专署税务局答复是：全部税款已过账转交省人民政府，没有办法退还。县人民政府就以专署税务局的答复转告了工商界代表。又如对于北浩营和姜营村的水利纠纷问题，县人民政府水利局曾派人去涿鹿县姜营村处理过；但是，他们不了解这一水利纠纷问题不能解决的关键是因为北浩营和姜营村之间历史上有矛盾，因此，虽然曾两次去姜营村处理这一问题，都没有使问题获得解决。还有旧庄户村群众提出的前中共察南地委会冯志恩在该村借的四百四十一斤小米，现在已经四年的时间，还没有归还，该村群众要县人民政府想办法解决这一问题，县人民政府请示专署，因为专署没有答复，就拖下来了。
    对人民代表会议提案的这种处理结果，已经引起了群众的不满。群众认为“提了意见不能解决，还提什么意见！”如北浩营的群众对县人民政府处理该村和姜营村水利纠纷的结果极为不满。该村农民许守印说：“上级叫怎么办，怎么办就对了，办不了的事情提意见也不管事，我们和姜营村的水渠纠纷，提到人民代表会上已经一年了，还是不能解决。”许守云的妻子说：“县代表也不顶事，提出意见还不是不能解决！”桑园村的人民代表、县常务委员会的委员于生贵说：“我们提的意见县里不给解决，群众心里就凉了（不愿再提意见了）。”新保安镇的人民代表张纯功，提起提案问题时，也表示非常不满。他说：“群众提意见是要求政府想办法解决问题，意见是提了，结果怎样，谁也不知道。以后谁还愿意提意见！”
    从第三次人民代表会议以后，该县对人民代表的提案更加不注意了。据该县郭县长说：三次代表会后，我们就没有想过提案的事情。因此，提案就一次比一次的减少了。
    第四、五、六次人民代表会议，在开会的通知上也没有提到搜集提案，大会上也没有专人负责搜集提案，也就没有组织“提案审查委员会”。代表们都是临时凑几条交给县长，由县长在大会闭幕前简单地解答一下。直到现在，第四、五、六次大会提案的数字、提案底稿都找不到。知道的只是：第四次各界人民代表会议的提案共一百余件；第五次各界人民代表会议的提案数目不详；第六次各界人民代表会议的提案只有五、六件。至于对提案处理的结果当然就更谈不到了。
    那么这些提案究竟从那里来的呢？据调查，第四次人民代表会议的提案是代表们临时凑的，第五次人民代表会议的提案，我们访问了很多大会工作人员，都回答：“记不清了”，第六次人民代表会议的提案，是在大会闭幕前一天的夜里，有五、六个小纸条凑起来交给县长的。新保安前进街人民代表顾万银说：“县里开代表会就是布置工作，我们带去提案也没有人搜集，也没有时间讨论。”辛庄子村人民代表王淑珍（女），参加六次县人民代表会议时，带着该村群众要求修水渠的提案，因为没有人管理提案，她不知道把提案交给谁，就又带回去了。
    问题已经很明显了，怀来县人民代表会议所收到的提案所以愈来愈少，完全是因为没有认真负责地处理提案所造成的。
