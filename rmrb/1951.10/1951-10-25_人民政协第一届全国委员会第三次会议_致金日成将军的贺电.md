    The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
    Message of Greetings to General Kim Il-sung

To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army:

    As we commemorate the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting shoulder to shoulder against American aggression, the Third Session of the First National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference of China extends our lofty, warm, and militant greetings to you and the entire Korean People's Army, and to all the fighting Korean people!

    The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, closely united, resisting the common enemy, have already achieved great victories. This victory has defended the freedom and independence of the People's Korea and safeguarded the security of the People's China. The people of China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth. In this common struggle, the long-standing brotherly friendship and unity between the two peoples have been greatly developed and consolidated.

    American imperialism has suffered severe defeats in its war of aggression against Korea and is in a dilemma. The Chinese people will further strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteers in their just war of self-defense against American aggression alongside the Korean People's Army on the Korean front, and support the proposals of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation regarding armistice negotiations, to strive for a victorious end to the Korean anti-aggression war.

    We firmly believe that the people of China and Korea, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely be able to crush the aggression of American imperialism and realize the aspirations of the Chinese, Korean, and Asian people to defend peace.

    Long live the militant fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

             The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
                                          October 24, 1951
