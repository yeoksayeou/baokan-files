Brief Comments on Cultural Life

Newspapers Should Not Abuse Dialects, Local Slang, and Obsolete Foreign Words

In its editorial on June 6th, "Correctly Use the Motherland's Language, and Strive for the Purity and Health of Language," this newspaper criticized the phenomenon of indiscriminately abusing dialects, local slang, and foreign words. However, some newspapers still abuse dialects, local slang, and even obsolete foreign words. For example, the article "The Driving Force for Promoting Work - Patriotic Ideological Education" on the third page of the Heilongjiang Daily on September 5th used the following five or six slang phrases in the first section, which was only over four hundred words long: "Twenty-two laborers, planting one hundred and thirty *qing* of land, *bang bang ying*," "They don't know how to *fen gong tiao shan*," "When *bang chan er bian di*," "Old people who usually don't attend meetings." "*Bang bang ying*" can be replaced with "not considering it a big deal," the four characters "*fen gong tiao shan*" can be simply replaced with "*fen gong*" ("division of labor"), "*bang chan er bian di de shi hou*" is not as good as "when it's almost time to hoe the land for the second time," "*shang hui*" is a saying among the masses, but it is an incorrect and unhealthy language, and it is easy to be confused with "*shang hui*" meaning going to a temple fair. A title on the third page of the same newspaper on September 4th used even more difficult-to-understand abbreviations, especially obsolete foreign words: "Qitie Three-Way Valve Group." Does "Qitie" refer to the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, or the Qiqihar Railway Factory, or is it a general term for both? At first glance, it is easy to mistake "Qitie San" for a personal name. And "three-way valve" is a language created by Japanese imperialism (it refers to a type of iron pipe joint). These unhealthy languages should never appear in newspapers.

Dialects and local slang are not absolutely unusable, but must be adopted critically, and those reasonable, logical, and habitually used by most people must be selected for use. Only by treating the language issue seriously can newspapers stand at the forefront of the struggle "for the purity and health of the language" and guide the masses forward. Therefore, the language used in newspapers should be strictly selected, pure, and healthy. Otherwise, it will contribute to the confusion of language.

    文化生活简评
    报纸不应滥用方言土语和陈腐的外来语
    六月六日本报在“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争”的社论中，曾批评了不加选择地滥用方言、土语和外来语的现象。但还有些报纸至今依然滥用方言土语甚至陈腐的外来语。例如九月五日黑龙江日报第三版“推动工作的动力——爱国思想教育”一文，在第一节内仅仅四百余字，即用了这样五、六句土语：“二十二个劳力，种一百三十垧地，帮帮硬”，“他们不会分工调扇”，“帮铲二遍地的时候”，“平常不大上会的老年人”等等。“帮帮硬”是可以代之以“满不算一回事”的，“分工调扇”四字仅用“分工”即可，“帮铲二遍地的时候”，就不如用“快要铲二遍地的时候”，“上会”虽是群众的说法，但它是一种不正确不健康的语言，而且容易和上庙会的“上会”相混同。该报九月四日第三版的一个标题，更运用了很难解的简称特别是陈腐的外来语：“齐铁三通阀小组”。“齐铁”究竟是指齐齐哈尔铁路局，还是指齐齐哈尔铁路工厂，还是两者通用呢？乍一看，很容易误认“齐铁三”是个人名。而“三通阀”则是日本帝国主义制造的语言（它是表明一种铁管接头的东西）。这些不健康的语言，决不应该在报纸上出现。
    方言土语并不是绝对不可用，而是必须批判地采用，必须选择那些合理的、合乎逻辑的，而又为大多数人所惯用的语言来用。报纸只有严肃地对待语言问题，才能在“为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争”中站在斗争的前列，并引导群众前进。因此，报纸所用的语言，应该是经过严格选择的、纯洁健康的语言。否则，它将会助长语言的混乱。
