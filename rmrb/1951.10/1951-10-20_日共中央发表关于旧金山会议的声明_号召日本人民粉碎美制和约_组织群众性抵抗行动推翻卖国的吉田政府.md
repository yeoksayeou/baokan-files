Xinhua News Agency, 19th: (Delayed Tokyo dispatch) The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the San Francisco Conference on August 25th. The statement is as follows:

Japan is now about to sign a document of enslavement in San Francisco, a document that will keep the Japanese nation in perpetual servitude and turn them into cannon fodder, to be used in new wars. It is precisely at this moment that the Japanese nation is suffering the greatest humiliation and is in an unprecedented national crisis in our history. Foreign troops, determined to remain in our country and expand military bases throughout our country, have now become the masters of our homeland and are trying to control all of Japan's national industries, revive Japanese militarism, and drive the sons of Japan back to the battlefield, thereby bringing slavery and death to the entire Japanese nation.

The preparation, drafting, and conclusion of this illegal separate treaty are in complete contempt of all international agreements regarding the settlement of the Japanese question. The attempt to conclude this illegal separate treaty is clearly intended to deliberately incite hostility and strife internationally, undermine the surging and growing forces of peace throughout the world, and thereby deepen the war crisis. The majority of the world's people firmly oppose this war treaty, led by the Soviet people.

Signing such a treaty means Japan is declaring war on the Soviet Union and China, meaning we will be used as mercenaries, as destroyers of world peace, and will openly attempt to launch aggression against the people of Asian countries. Even after this treaty is signed, it will be invalid. We, the Japanese people, cannot recognize this treaty as a peace treaty and will continue to fight against it until we finally crush it.

All the Japanese people oppose this treaty, while a small handful of reactionaries, a group of traitors—including Yoshida and his henchmen—who are trying to exploit the stationing of occupation forces and war to oppress the people and make a fortune, are expressing "gratitude" for this treaty. Only a small group of war-mongers who actually drafted this treaty actively support it.

Obviously, this conspiracy planned by a small group of war instigators and traitors is doomed to failure in the face of the fighting, peace-loving people of the world. If we fight, are not afraid of persecution and slanderous accusations, and unite well, we can smash this attempt to conclude a separate treaty and rearm, defend peace, and seek national liberation and democracy. We cannot stand idly by, we cannot passively accept the fate of enslavement and war that is about to befall us. Now is the time for all the Japanese people to unite with fervent patriotism, organize mass resistance actions—rallies, protests, demonstrations—to overthrow the Yoshida government and defeat the San Francisco conspiracy.

We appeal to the Japanese people, especially workers, farmers, and patriotic masses, to unite and fight with us for peace and democracy.

We take this opportunity to reaffirm that our party will faithfully fight for the interests of the Japanese people, for world peace, and for the great cause of national liberation.

Oppose the San Francisco Conference, oppose the separate treaty and re-militarization!

Oppose military alliances and the Pacific Pact!

Demand the immediate convening of a peace treaty conference with the Soviet Union, People's China, and all relevant countries participating!

Demand the immediate withdrawal of occupation forces after the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty in accordance with the Potsdam Proclamation!

Overthrow the traitorous Yoshida government!

Demand the conclusion of a peace pact between the five great powers!

    日共中央发表关于旧金山会议的声明
    号召日本人民粉碎美制和约
    组织群众性抵抗行动推翻卖国的吉田政府
    【新华社十九日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央委员会在八月二十五日发表了关于旧金山会议的声明。声明如下：
    日本现在即将在旧金山签署一个奴役的文件，这个文件将使日本民族永远处于奴役状态中，并把他们变为炮灰，在新战争中供人利用。正是在这个时候，日本民族正在遭受最大的耻辱，并处于我国历史上空前严重的民族危机中。决心留驻我国并在我国各地扩大军事基地的外国军队，现在成了我们祖国的主人，并且正在试图控制日本所有的民族工业，复活日本的军国主义，并驱使日本的子弟重上战场，从而为整个日本民族带来奴役和死亡。
    这个非法单独和约的准备、草拟和缔结，都是完全蔑视有关解决日本问题的一切国际协定的。缔结这个非法单独和约的企图，用意显然是故意在国际间煽起敌对和争端，破坏全世界汹涌澎湃日益增长的和平力量，从而加深战争危机。世界大多数的人民都坚决反对这个战争条约，在先头领导的是苏联人民。
    在这样一个条约上签字，意味着日本向苏联和中国宣战，意味着我们将被利用充当雇佣军，充当世界和平的破坏者，并将公开企图向亚洲各国人民发动侵略。即使在这个条约签订之后，它还是无效的。我们日本人民不能承认这个条约是和约，并将为反对它而继续斗争，直到最后把它粉碎为止。
    全体日本人民都反对这个条约，而试图利用占领军的留驻和战争来压迫人民和发财的一小撮反动派、一群卖国贼——包括吉田和他的帮凶在内——却正在对这个条约表示“感激”。只有一小群实际草拟这个条约的战争贩子才积极支持这个条约。
    显然，一小撮战争挑拨者和卖国贼所策划的这个阴谋，在战斗的爱好和平的世界各国人民面前是注定要遭受失败的。如果我们进行斗争，不怕迫害和诽谤的控告，并好好团结起来，我们就能够粉碎这个缔结单独和约和重整军备的企图，保卫和平，并求得民族解放和民主。我们不能袖手旁观，不能对将要降临到我们身上的奴役和战争的命运不加抵抗。现在是日本全体人民以热烈的爱国主义精神团结起来，组织群众性的抵抗行动——集会、抗议、示威——以推翻吉田政府并击败旧金山阴谋的时候了。
    我们向日本人民，特别是工人、农民和爱国群众呼吁，要求他们团结起来，和我们一道为争取和平、民主而斗争。
    我们趁这个机会重新保证：我党将忠实地为日本人民的利益、为世界和平和民族解放的伟大事业而斗争。
    反对旧金山会议，反对单独和约和重新军国主义化！
    反对军事联盟和太平洋联盟！
    要求立即召开有苏联、人民中国和一切有关国家参加的对日和约会议！
    要求在根据波茨坦公告缔结全面和约后立即撤退占领军！
    推翻卖国的吉田政府！
    要求缔结五大国和平公约！
