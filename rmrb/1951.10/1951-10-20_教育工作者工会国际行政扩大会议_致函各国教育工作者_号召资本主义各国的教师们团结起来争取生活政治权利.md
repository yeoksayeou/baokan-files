The International Educational Workers' Union, an industry department of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held an expanded meeting of its Administrative Committee in Erfurt, German Democratic Republic, from August 20th to August 28th. The meeting discussed issues such as the combination of educational groups and the working class to jointly struggle for the improvement of schools and the defense of peace. The meeting stipulated the program of activities for the International Union in the next six months and the specific tasks of each member country, and unanimously adopted an open letter to national and international educational workers' organizations. The letter begins by stating: "The Erfurt meeting of the Administrative Committee of the International Educational Workers' Union firmly believes that educational workers around the world, regardless of their political or religious affiliation, have common interests and common tasks. In order to obtain their interests and complete their tasks, we call on them to unite all their strength." The letter then points out: "The material and social conditions of teachers in capitalist countries are very difficult: meager wages, social insurance not funded by the government, no paid leave, no freedom of speech and expression, and no freedom to organize truly democratic educational groups. This is the situation of educational workers in some capitalist countries. This situation cannot continue. Improving the material and social conditions of teachers and ensuring that they have reasonable living and working conditions is the task of educational workers around the world. The demands of teachers in certain countries should be supported by teachers and educational organizations around the world; their demands are: improved wages, equal pay for equal work for men and women, at least forty-eight days of paid leave per year, government-funded social insurance, and freedom of speech and expression." The letter concludes by calling on all educational organizations to actively support the demands of educational workers and educational organizations to improve the material and social conditions of teachers and the people's education, and stating: "The task of educational workers around the world is to: "Convene national meetings, unite all teachers, and implement methods of struggle to oppose the current deteriorating situation of schools and teachers, and oppose the threat of new wars." "Teachers around the world should unite their strength to form a united front in order to strive for the progress of schools and the improvement of the situation of educational workers."

    教育工作者工会国际行政扩大会议
    致函各国教育工作者
    号召资本主义各国的教师们团结起来争取生活政治权利
    【本报讯】世界工联产业部之一的教育工作者工会国际，于八月二十日至八月二十八日在德意志民主共和国欧福特举行行政委员会扩大会议，讨论了关于教育团体与工人阶级结合为改进学校和保卫和平而进行共同斗争等问题。会议规定了今后半年中工会国际的活动纲领和各会员国的具体任务，并一致通过了给各全国性及国际性的教育工作者团体的一封公开信。该信首称：“教育工作者工会国际行政委员会欧福特会议坚信全世界教育工作者不论他们的政治宗教派别如何，都有其共同的利益与共同的任务，为获得他们的利益并完成他们的任务，我们号召他们应团结起他们一切的力量。”该信继指出：“资本主义各国教师们的物质社会条件是非常困难的：菲薄的工资，并非政府出钱的社会保险，没有工资照付的休假，没有言论和发表意见的自由，没有组织真正民主教育团体的自由，这些就是某些资本主义国家教育工作者所处的情况。这种情况不能再延续下去，改善教师们的物质社会条件，保证他们有合理的生活条件与工作条件，这是全世界教育工作者的任务。某些国家教师们的要求当为全世界的教师及教育团体所支持；他们的要求是：改善工资，男女同工同酬，每年至少有四十八天工资照付的假日，政府出钱的社会保险，言论与发表意见的自由。”该信最后号召一切教育工作团体积极支持教育工作者们和教育团体为改善教师物质社会情况以及人民教育的要求，并称：全世界教育工作者的任务是：“召开全国性的会议，团结所有的教师，实行以斗争的方法来反对目前日益恶化的学校及教师们的处境，反对新战争的威胁。”“全世界教师们集合他们的力量来成立一个统一战线，以便争取学校的进步，与教育工作者情况的改善。”
