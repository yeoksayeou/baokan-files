    Nurse and Wounded Soldier
    Yang Jian
    Female nurse Yang Yumin of a certain field hospital of the Volunteer Army recently received a red booklet brought from the front lines. It was given to her by Volunteer Army soldier Wang Fanghu. On the first page of the booklet were written a few uneven lines: "Respected Comrade Yang Yumin: This is the prize I received for my special-class merit on the front lines. I am willing to give it to you to thank you for your selfless and loving spirit in saving me. I hope you will record more of your exemplary deeds in this booklet."
    Wang Fanghu was a seriously wounded soldier who had been recuperating in this field hospital. He was wounded during the Battle of Changjin Lake in December of last year and collapsed on the battlefield. It was a snowy dusk. Nurse Yang Yumin, with her hands red from the cold and her lips turning purple, dragged a sled across the battlefield, searching for soldiers wounded in the battle. The troops had already moved forward to pursue the enemy, and the battlefield was littered with large quantities of weapons and supplies abandoned by the American invading army. She found Wang Fanghu next to a pine tree, his body covered with a thin layer of snow. She squatted down and gently wiped the snow from his head, then brushed the snow from his body. Suddenly, she jumped up in surprise. She discovered that the soldier was still breathing, and felt his pulse beating faintly. She thought: He's probably frozen. She hurriedly helped him sit up, pressed him close to her body, and wrapped her own coat around him. After he woke up in the warmth, she put him on the sled and dragged him back to the hospital through the heavy wind and snow. Wang Fanghu had lost too much blood and needed an immediate transfusion; Yang Yumin's blood type happened to be the same as his, so she unhesitatingly donated several hundred cc of blood.
    One day, Yang Yumin was in the room feeding the wounded soldiers. Suddenly, enemy planes strafed nearby, and a bullet hit the corner of the thatched house, setting the grass on fire. She quickly ran over there and stomped out the fire with her feet. While tidying things up, she told everyone, "The thatched house is dangerous. Let's go to the ditch below. Those who can move, walk themselves; those who can't move, I'll carry them." As soon as she finished speaking, another burst of gunfire came down, and the thatched house caught fire. Of the four wounded soldiers in the room, two who could move had already gone out. She hurriedly carried a seriously wounded soldier on her back and ran outside, returning immediately after reaching the ditch. By this time, the thatched house was engulfed in flames. She ran to the door, but was pushed back by the flames several times. Her eyes stared at the fire, as if she saw the fire burning Wang Fanghu's clothes, still in the room, burning his flesh. She gritted her teeth and suddenly rushed into the thatched house, and in a moment, she staggered out of the flames carrying Wang Fanghu on her back. Just as she reached the ditch, she fainted. Half of her hair was burned off, a large piece of her cotton coat was burned, and her cotton pants were still smoking. Wang Fanghu lay beside her, his cotton coat also smoking. He endured the pain of his wounds and slowly crawled to Yang Yumin's side, using his hands to put out the sparks on her body, calling out "Yang Yumin! Yang Yumin!" Tears of gratitude welled up in his eyes. Yang Yumin opened her eyes and saw Wang Fanghu crawling beside her. She forgot about her own burns and smiled with relief.
    On the Korean battlefield, there are countless outstanding medical workers who serve the Volunteer Army's wounded and sick day and night in the spirit of Bethune and Lanting. These new types of doctors and nurses love the soldiers who are gloriously wounded in defending the motherland and world peace, and the soldiers also love these white-clad warriors who save lives and heal the wounded. Nurse Yang Yumin is one of them. Many wounded and sick soldiers, after returning to their units from the field hospital where Yang Yumin belonged, often remember Yang Yumin's achievements. They encourage each other, saying: "We must repay them with victories in battle." (Xinhua News Agency)

    护士与伤员
    杨坚
    志愿军某战地医院的女护士杨玉敏最近收到从前线捎来的一本红色的小册子。这是志愿军战士王方虎送给她的。小本子的第一页上写着几行不太整齐的字：“敬爱的杨玉敏同志：这是我在前线立了特等功的奖品，我愿意把它送给你，感谢你舍身救我的友爱精神，希望你在这本子上记下你更多的模范事迹。”
    王方虎是在这个战地医院休养过的重伤员。在去年十二月长津湖战役中，他负了伤，昏倒在战场上。这是一个风雪交加的黄昏，护士杨玉敏冻得两手通红，嘴唇发紫，拖着一架爬犁在战场上奔走，寻找在战斗中受伤的战士。部队已往前追击敌人，战场上堆着美国侵略军丢下的大批武器和物资。她在一颗松树旁边发现了身上已盖了一层薄雪的王方虎。她蹲下身来，轻轻地用手抹去他头上的雪，然后又拂去了他身上的雪。她忽然惊喜得跳了起来。她发现这个战士还会呼吸，摸了摸他的脉搏还在轻微地跳动。她想：大概冻坏了，急忙把他上身扶起，紧贴在自己的身上，并把自己的大衣裹在他身上，等到他在温暖中苏醒过来，把他装在爬犁上冒着大风雪拖回医院。王方虎流血过多，需要立即输血；杨玉敏的血型正巧与他相同，她就毫不犹豫地献出了几百西西血液。
    一天，杨玉敏在屋子里喂饭给伤员吃。突然敌机在附近扫射，一颗子弹正好打在草房角上，把草烧着了。她赶快跑到那里用脚踩灭了火，一面整理东西一面告诉大家说：“草屋危险，我们到下边沟里去，能动的自己走，不能动的由我来背。”她才说罢，又是一梭子枪弹打下来，草房烧起来了。房里四个伤员中两个能动的已经走出去，她急忙背起一个重伤员向外跑，跑到沟里马上又返回来。这时草房已大火熊熊，她跑到门口几次都被火焰推了出来。她眼睛瞪着火，仿佛看见火烧着了还在屋里的王方虎的衣服，烧到了他的肉体。她咬了咬牙猛然冲进草房，一会儿背着王方虎跌跌跄跄地从火焰里钻出来，刚跑到山沟里，她便昏倒了。她的头发烧掉了半截，棉袄烧了一大块，棉裤上还冒着烟。王方虎躺在她身旁，棉袄上也冒着烟。他忍着创痛慢慢地爬到杨玉敏身边，用手扑灭她身上的火星，喊着“杨玉敏！杨玉敏！”感激的泪珠不禁夺眶而出。杨玉敏睁开眼睛看见王方虎在她身边爬着，她忘记了自己的火伤而放心地笑了。
    在朝鲜战场有着无数优秀的医务工作者，他们日日夜夜以白求恩和李蓝丁的精神为志愿军伤病员们服务。这些新型的医师与护士们热爱为保卫祖国和世界和平而光荣负伤的战士，战士们也热爱这些为他们救死入生的白衣战士。护士杨玉敏就是其中的一个。许多伤病员从杨玉敏所属那个战地医院归队后，经常怀念着杨玉敏的功迹，他们相互勉励说：“我们要用战斗的胜利来报答她们”。（新华社）
