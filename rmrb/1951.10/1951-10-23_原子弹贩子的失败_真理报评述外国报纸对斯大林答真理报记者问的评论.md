Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: Pravda published an article entitled "The Failure of the Atomic Bomb Peddlers," commenting on foreign newspapers' comments on Stalin's answers to questions from a reporter of Pravda, saying: All foreign newspapers' attention is focused on Comrade Stalin's answers to a reporter of Pravda regarding atomic weapons. Good men and women and democratic newspapers who uphold the policy of international cooperation unanimously praised the speech of the great leader of the Soviet people, considering it another confirmation of the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy and another effective blow to the plans of the imperialist warmongers who are using atomic bombs to intimidate the world.

The reaction of democratic newspapers in various countries makes it completely clear to us the attitude of the masses of people in various countries towards Stalin's foreign policy. The democratic public in various countries believes that the Soviet Union's possession of atomic weapons is a guarantee for consolidating peace.

"The fact that the Soviet Union possesses atomic weapons has foiled Truman's criminal attempts and strengthened the confidence of hundreds of millions of people, making them believe that the atomic weapons in the hands of imperialists will be shot down." (Polish "Freedom Fighter")

"Comrade Stalin's speech is new evidence of the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy, proving that the Soviet Union has no intention of attacking the United States or any other country." (French "L'Humanité")

"Stalin's speech will undoubtedly overwhelm the arrogance of the warmongers." (Swedish "New Times")

"Comrade Stalin's speech once again strongly emphasizes that peace can be maintained." (Organ of the Dutch Communist Party, "De Waarheid". The issue of the newspaper carrying the full text of Stalin's speech was snapped up in all cities in the Netherlands.)

"The Soviet Union's possession of the atomic bomb further strengthens the peace forces of the world. American imperialists want to permanently monopolize the secret of the atomic bomb, and for this reason, they are constantly intimidating and blackmailing the people of other countries. Marshal Stalin has made it very clear to the American warmongers: their calculations are wrong." (Vietnam News Agency)

"It has long been clear in the psychology and consciousness of the general public what Stalin said.... However, the facts clarified by Stalin have special significance. Because, in the struggle against America's war hysteria, in addition to the voices of hundreds of millions of people around the world who know the truth, he has also issued a responsible and warning voice from the leader of a great country, and the war preparations of the Atlantic Group are clearly aimed at this country." (Italian "Il Paese")

"Nothing can contribute more to consolidating peace than this very timely speech by Stalin." (Organ of the Czechoslovak Youth League, "Mladá Fronta")

Newspapers and the public in Korea and China enthusiastically praised Stalin's speech and emphasized in their comments that Stalin's speech had foiled the imperialists' atomic blackmail.

The Chinese newspaper "China Youth Daily" said: American warmongers are always using the atomic monster to intimidate peace-loving people. Isn't it obvious that the Soviet Union's possession of atomic weapons provides a reliable guarantee for world peace?

The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" said: "The Korean people have drawn the only conclusion from Marshal Stalin's speech: the American imperialists are not the monopolists of atomic weapons. They can no longer use this weapon to scare the people of various countries, and they can no longer threaten to completely destroy the people of various countries. The fact that the Soviet Union, while mastering the secret of atomic weapons, also demands the prohibition of this weapon and the use of stored atomic bombs for peaceful purposes in line with the interests of the people, particularly demonstrates the Soviet Union's noble policy."

The fact that the Soviet Union possesses atomic weapons increases the chances of success for peace fighters and increases their confidence that atomic weapons can destroy the aggressive plans of atomic peddlers. By breaking the American monopoly on atomic weapons, American atomic blackmail has been fundamentally destroyed. This is the main conclusion that can be drawn from the countless comments caused by Comrade Stalin's speech around the world. This conclusion is also confirmed by the impression that this speech created in the imperialist camp.

American newspapers were forced to admit that the Soviet Union's atomic bomb test "unfortunately reminded people that we can no longer monopolize atomic weapons." One of the most clamorous mouthpieces of monopoly capitalists - atomic peddlers, the American "Newsweek," in an article entitled "The Comparison of Atomic Power," mourned "the days when the United States monopolized atomic weapons and the Soviet Union had only a very few atomic bombs."

"Newsweek" said: "The Soviet Union's second atomic bomb explosion and Stalin's speech mean that we can no longer ignore the possibility that atomic bombs will be abolished as strategic weapons.... We have long realized that when the Soviet Union gains the power to conduct atomic warfare, this weapon may lose some of its effectiveness. The Soviet Union's first atomic explosion in 1949 foreshadowed this change in the comparison of atomic power. We have probably already or are about to reach this change."

Comrade Stalin's remarks left the American ruling clique at a loss, exposing their true colors without their realizing it. They have relied on the monopoly of atomic weapons, intimidating the entire world, and hoarding atomic bombs for so long in their policies that they become flustered whenever it is proven that this monopoly no longer exists. Contrary to common sense, they continue to cling to the policy of atomic blackmail.

This is the reason why several American congressmen demanded an increase in appropriations for the manufacture of atomic bombs. The newspapers of the monopoly capitalists have resumed this threatening propaganda. Washington has placed the stale remarks made by Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Dean on September 21 in the Senate Appropriations Committee at the center of the propaganda being conducted in response to Stalin's speech. Dean boasted that the United States has various types of atomic bombs, especially "tactical" atomic weapons.

All these threats, exaggerations, and atomic blackmail, even to some people who share Dean's views, do not sound very convincing. For example, the New York Herald Tribune pointed out in an editorial: "No matter how beautifully one speaks on the issue of military atomics, it is of no avail. The history since the bombing of Hiroshima has proven that the series of reactions caused politically by atomic bomb explosions are just as serious as those caused in the field of physics, and are far more uneconomical."

According to reports from foreign journalists, Comrade Stalin's speech has caused unrest and panic in Washington. American officials initially shielded themselves with a "wall of silence," surprising the journalists from the Marshallized Western European countries who were waiting for them to issue a signal. This may well explain why many bourgeois newspapers in Western Europe were initially able to publish Comrade Stalin's speech in a more or less correct manner. For example, in France, reactionary newspapers such as "France Soir" and "Paris Presse" also published parts of Comrade Stalin's speech stating that the Soviet Union not only opposes the use of atomic weapons, but also advocates the prohibition of atomic weapons and the cessation of atomic weapons production, as well as stating that the Soviet Union has never had any intention of attacking the United States or any other country.

The attitude of Western European newspapers in presenting the issue of the atomic bomb reflects the contradictions between the United States and its partners and satellite states. British, French, and Italian newspapers, as well as newspapers in many other countries, were happy to conclude that Comrade Stalin's speech would surely help to resume negotiations on the issue of atomic weapons. Even newspapers that are very close to the United States, such as the French "Le Figaro," expressed this view, believing that due to Stalin's speech, the resumption of four-power negotiations for the prohibition of atomic weapons can be expected, and that "the atomic debate will affect American public opinion, causing American public opinion to pressure American leaders to agree to hold diplomatic negotiations between the great powers..."

The Italian "Il Popolo" wrote: "Stalin's speech to a reporter of Pravda has made the resumption of negotiations on international control of atomic energy, it can be said, more hopeful than it was a week ago."

The Rome correspondent of "Il Messaggero" pointed out: Stalin's speech to a reporter of Pravda "aims to ease international tensions."

British Conservative and Labour newspapers apparently attempted to despise the significance of Comrade Stalin's speech, copying American arguments to counter it. However, some British newspapers also reflected the opinions of broad sectors of society, who believe that the atomic arms expansion movement is simply insane. Some articles declared that efforts must be made to prohibit atomic weapons. For example, the well-known atomic physicist Bohr wrote in the "Reynold News": "This news from Moscow means that we have to work even harder to achieve international control of atomic weapons. Negotiations with the Soviet Union should be reopened by us with greater compromise. The Russians have always firmly demanded a ban on atomic bombs."

Even "The Times of London," after pointing out that atomic warfare would make the British Isles, one of the world's most vulnerable targets, face a terrible future, also expressed support for the resumption of negotiations on the prohibition of atomic weapons, and also gave some fair comments on the Soviet control plan.

Even conservative newspapers have made such remarks, expressing that negotiations should be held between the great powers to ease international tensions. Such remarks are a direct result of the firm and unwavering demand of the masses of people for the prohibition of atomic weapons.

However, this sentiment is not liked by people in Washington, who do not want to improve the international situation.

The newspapers of American monopoly capitalists are troubled by the increasing popularity of "neutralism" in Western European countries. "The New York Times" expressed serious anxiety because in the "free world" (as reactionaries often call the countries of the aggressive Atlantic Group), there is much discussion about easing tensions.

The "New York Post," commenting on the mood in Washington's allies participating in the Atlantic Group, said: "The existence of 'neutralism' in Britain and Western European countries, Middle Eastern countries, India, and non-communist Asian countries is a major psychological event in the current stage of America's struggle for a 'strong position'."

The newspaper believes that the abolition of America's monopoly on atomic weapons has made the people of Western Europe and Asia understand that the development of atomic weapons "will not allow the United States to do whatever it wants."

The newspaper then expressed a conjecture that is not lacking in common sense, which is that the attempt of American monopoly capitalists to guarantee that atomic weapons will only be used against the military, and to reassure public opinion with such promises, will also fail to achieve their goals.

The newspaper said: "The point is that you can certainly use 'tactical' (that is, atomic cannons) atomic weapons against the armies of our enemy countries, without using larger atomic bombs to bomb the cities of our allies. That is a helpless guarantee, but Europeans will ask: will the Americans spare the cities of those allies that have once fallen into the hands of the enemy from being bombed?"

The atrocities of the American military in Korea can serve as an answer to this question.

The reaffirmation of the fact that the Soviet Union possesses atomic weapons is seen by the broad masses of people in Western Europe as an opportunity to promote the resolution of the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons, thereby strengthening the possibility of peace. It is obvious that this is precisely the reason why American newspapers have remained silent or distorted the part of Comrade Stalin's speech that addressed international control. In order to confuse public opinion, they are spreading a slanderous rumor, insisting that the Soviet Union is unwilling to establish international control over the production of atomic weapons because it opposes the American plan.

American and British newspapers and radio stations, as well as Marshallized newspapers in Western European countries, are repeatedly spreading this slander. They are recklessly and shamelessly disregarding the facts, although simply looking up the reports of the United Nations General Assembly is enough to convince people that the representatives of the Soviet Union in the United Nations have consistently worked to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international control over the production of atomic bombs.

At the same time, American newspapers have revealed the anxiety of the American ruling clique over the fact that the position adopted by the Soviet Union on the issue of control has a great deal of appeal. The "New York Times" acknowledged this in an article on October 7.

The newspaper said: "The straightforward argument of abolishing the atomic bomb has a powerful psychological appeal."

Stalin has exposed the deceptive nature of America's so-called international control plan, which does not start from prohibiting atomic weapons, but from legalizing this weapon; it does not stipulate the cessation of atomic weapons production, but stipulates the continuation of this weapon's production. At the same time, Stalin said: The Soviet Union advocates establishing international control so that the decision to prohibit atomic weapons and stop the production of atomic weapons is strictly and honestly implemented.

The conspiracy of the atomic peddlers has been completely exposed. Their mouthpiece, "Newsweek" magazine, does not hide its annoyance at the fact that the movement in favor of concluding an international agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons will eventually become stronger and stronger.

The magazine wrote: "We must estimate that this movement may have an increasing attraction for some free peoples... We may be under their increasing pressure to promise not to use atomic bombs as strategic weapons unless the Russians use them first."

Because the Soviet Union already possesses atomic weapons, the magazine believes that the United States "should think twice before dropping atomic bombs on Russian cities."

Summarizing the remarks of American and British bourgeois commentators, we can conclude that the propaganda offensive organized by Washington in response to Stalin's speech has failed shamefully. A commentary broadcast on London on October 7 pointed out that the camp of another war instigators insisted that atomic bombs were only used to bomb military targets, this assurance is difficult to reassure the ordinary people of Western Europe, because, as London Broadcasting pointed out, they are obviously carefully studying every word in Stalin's speech in order to discover a glimmer of hope for establishing effective international control over atomic energy.

The commentator continued: The attitude of ordinary people in Western Europe towards the arms expansion movement is quite fatalistic.

However, the desire of those frantic enemies of peace, the instigators and organizers of another war, to disperse the vigilance of the people of various countries and to paralyze the will of the people to resist and oppose atomic plans is clearly revealed in the conclusions of these remarks.

These are futile hopes! The masses of the people have fought and will continue to fight against the use and production of atomic weapons. This has been confirmed by many facts. Comrade Stalin's speech proves that the wishes of those ordinary people who carefully study every word of this speech are justified, just as the London commentator also pointed out.

World public opinion and the ordinary people of all countries advocate the prohibition of the use and production of atomic weapons, and advocate the establishment of effective control over such prohibitions, rather than that false American-style control. The various comments on Stalin's speech on the clamor of foreign newspapers regarding the Soviet Union's atomic bomb test have confirmed this. The atomic peddlers have also suffered a serious defeat this time.

    原子弹贩子的失败
    ——真理报评述外国报纸对斯大林答真理报记者问的评论
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：真理报以“原子弹贩子的失败”为题著文评述外国报纸对斯大林答真理报记者问的评论说：一切外国报纸的注意力都集中在斯大林同志关于原子武器答真理报记者问一事。维护国际合作政策的善良的男女和民主报纸，一致赞扬伟大苏联人民领袖的谈话，认为这是苏联爱好和平政策的又一个确证，是对于正在用原子弹恫吓全世界的帝国主义者战争贩子们的计划的另一个有效的打击。
    各国民主报纸的反应，使我们完全明了各国人民群众对斯大林外交政策的态度。各国民主公众认为苏联拥有原子武器是巩固和平的一个保障。
    “苏联拥有原子武器这一事实，使杜鲁门的犯罪企图归于失败，并加强亿万人民的信心，使他们相信帝国主义者手中的原子武器将被击落。”（波兰“自由战士报”）
    “斯大林同志的谈话是苏联爱好和平的政策的新证据，证明苏联没有进攻美国或其他任何国家的意图。”（法国“人道报”）
    “斯大林的谈话，无疑地将要把战争贩子的傲慢自大压倒。”（瑞典“新时代报”）
    “斯大林同志的谈话再度十分有力地强调和平可以保持。”（荷共机关报“真理报”。该报登载斯大林谈话全文的一期，在荷兰各城市中被争购一空。）
    “苏联拥有原子弹进一步加强了全世界的和平力量。美国帝国主义者想永远垄断关于原子弹的秘密，为了这个缘故，他们时时刻刻都在恫吓和讹诈其它国家的人民。斯大林大元帅已经向美国战争贩子们说得很清楚：他们的算盘打错了。”（越南通讯社）
    “在一般人民的心理和意识上，久已清楚斯大林所说的一切……。然而斯大林所阐明的事实，却具有特殊的意义。因为，在反对美国的战争歇斯底里的斗争中，除了全世界通晓事理的亿万人民的声音以外，他又发出了一个伟大国家的领袖的负责和警告的声音，而大西洋集团的战争准备分明就是针对着这一个国家的。”（意大利“国家报”）
    “再没有什么比斯大林这个非常合时的谈话更能有助于巩固和平了。”（捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟机关报“青年阵线”报）
    朝鲜和中国的报纸及公众，极端热烈地赞美斯大林的谈话，并在它们的评论中着重指出：斯大林的谈话已经使帝国主义者的原子讹诈归于失败。
    中国报纸“中国青年报”说：美国战争贩子们老是用原子妖怪来恫吓爱好和平的人民。苏联有了原子武器，给与世界和平以可靠的保障，这难道还不明显吗？
    朝鲜报纸“劳动新闻”说：“朝鲜人民已经从斯大林大元帅的谈话中得到了唯一的结论，就是：美国帝国主义者不是原子武器的垄断者。他们不再能够用这种武器来吓诈各国人民了，不再能够威胁着要把各国人民完全消灭了。苏联虽然掌握原子武器的秘密，但同时要求禁止这种武器，把存储的原子弹用于符合人民利益的和平目的，这一事实特别表现出苏联的崇高政策。”
    苏联拥有原子武器这件事实，增加了和平战士们的获得成功的机会，并增加了他们对于原子武器能够摧毁原子贩子的侵略计划的信心。由于打破了美国对原子武器的垄断，美国原子讹诈已被根本摧毁了。这便是从斯大林同志的谈话在全世界引起的无数评论中可以得到的主要的结论。这种结论也被这篇谈话在帝国主义者阵营中造成的印象所证实了。
    美国报纸被迫承认：苏联的原子弹试验，“使人不幸想起了我们不再能够垄断原子武器了”。垄断资本家——原子贩子们的最叫嚣不休的喉舌之一，美国“新闻周刊”在题为“原子势力的对比”一文中，悼念着“美国垄断原子武器而苏联只有极少数原子弹的日子”。
    “新闻周刊”说：“苏联的第二次原子弹爆炸和斯大林的谈话，意味着我们不再能够漠视这种可能性，即：原子弹将被作为战略武器而予以取消。……我们久已体会到当苏联获得进行原子战争的力量时，这种武器可能失去了它的一些效力。一九四九年苏联的第一次原子爆炸，就预告了在原子势力的对比上所发生的这种变化。目前我们大概已经或者快要达到这种变化了。”
    斯大林同志的言论把美国统治集团弄得手足无措，使他们不知不觉地露出马脚来了。在他们的政策上，他们倚赖原子武器的垄断、恫吓整个世界，并储蓄原子弹已经有这么长久的时间，以致于每当证明这种垄断不再存在的时候，就使得他们慌乱起来。和常识相反，他们继续死抱住原子讹诈的政策。
    这就是美国几个国会议员之所以要求增加制造原子弹的拨款的缘故。垄断资本家的报纸又恢复了这种恫吓的宣传。华盛顿方面已经把原子能委员会主席狄安九月二十一日在参院拨款委员会中发表的陈腐的言论，放在为答复斯大林言论而进行的宣传的中心。狄安自夸美国拥有各种类型的原子弹，特别是“战术的”原子武器。
    所有这些恫吓、夸大和原子讹诈，甚至对于和狄安抱有同样见解的一些人，听来也不太能使人信服。例如，纽约先驱论坛报在社论中指出：“在军事原子问题方面不论说得怎样漂亮，也是无济于事的。轰炸广岛以来的历史已经证明，原子弹爆炸在政治上引起的一连串的反应，和在物理学领域内所引起的反应相较，是同样的严重，而且要不合算得多。”
    据外国记者们的报道，斯大林同志的谈话已在华盛顿引起骚动和惶惑。美国官方人士起初用一道“缄默的围墙”把自己掩蔽起来，使马歇尔化的西欧各国正盼望他们发出信号的那些记者们感到惊奇。这一点也许正好说明西欧许多资产阶级报纸起初为什么能够多多少少正确地登载斯大林同志谈话的内容。例如在法国，“法兰西晚报”和“巴黎新闻”这类反动报纸，也曾登载了斯大林同志的谈话中说苏联不仅反对使用原子武器、而且还主张禁止原子武器、停止原子武器生产的一段，以及说苏联并没有在什么时候进攻美国或其他任何国家的想法的一段。
    西欧报纸陈述原子弹问题时的态度，反映出美国和它的伙伴及卫星国之间的矛盾。英、法、意三国报纸，以及许多其他国家的报纸，都很高兴地下一结论，以为斯大林同志的谈话必将有助于恢复关于原子武器一事的谈判。就连跟美国方面非常接近的法国“费加罗报”这样的报纸，也表示了这种意见，认为由于斯大林的谈话，四国为禁止原子武器而恢复谈判一事可以预期了，认为“原子的争论会影响美国舆论，使美国舆论压迫美国领袖同意举行大国的外交谈判……”
    意大利“人民公报”写道：“斯大林对真理报记者发表的谈话，已使关于国际管制原子能的谈判的恢复，可以说比一周前有了更大的希望。”
     “邮报”的罗马记者指出：斯大林对真理报记者的谈话，“旨在缓和国际紧张空气”。
    英国保守党和工党的报纸，显然企图藐视斯大林同志谈话的意义，抄袭美国方面的论据来加以对抗。然而，某些英国报纸也反映出广大社会人士的意见，那些人士认为扩张原子军备运动简直是发疯。有些文章声明必须为禁止原子武器而努力。例如很著名的原子物理学家柏贺浦在“雷诺新闻”上写道：“从莫斯科传来的这个消息意味着：我们不得不更加努力为实现国际管制原子武器而斗争。与苏联谈判，应该由我们以更大的妥协精神来重新开始。俄国人一向坚决要求禁止原子弹。”
    就连“伦敦泰晤士报”在指出原子战争将使世界上最脆弱的目标之一即英伦三岛面向可怕的前途以后，也表示赞成恢复关于禁止原子武器的谈判，并且也给苏联的管制计划以一些公正的评语。
    就连保守党报纸也发表这一类言论，表示大国间应举行谈判以便缓和国际紧张局势，这一类言论是由于人民大众始终坚决要求实行禁止原子武器而产生的直接结果。
    然而，这种情绪不是华盛顿人士所喜欢的，华盛顿人士不要改善国际形势。
    美国垄断资本家的报纸，因“中立主义”的情绪在西欧各国中日益得势而感到烦恼。“纽约时报”表示严重的焦虑，因为在“自由世界”（反动分子往往这样称呼侵略性的大西洋集团的国家）中，大家议论纷纷要缓和紧张空气。
    “纽约邮报”评述参加大西洋集团的华盛顿的各盟国内的情绪说：“在英国和西欧各国、中东各国、印度以及非共产主义的亚洲各国中、‘中立主义’情绪的存在，乃是美国为‘坚强阵地’而斗争的现阶段中一桩心理学上的重大事件。”
    该报认为：美国对原子武器的垄断权的取消，使西欧和亚洲各国人民明白了：原子武器的发展“并不会使美国为所欲为”。
    该报紧接着表示一种并不是缺乏常识的推测，就是：美国垄断资本家们企图保证仅对军队使用原子武器，企图用这样的诺言来宽慰舆论界，那也是达不到目的的。
    该报说：“要点在于你固然可以使用‘战术的’（那就是原子大炮）原子武器对付我们敌国的军队，而不使用较大的原子弹去轰炸我们友邦的城市。那是一种无可奈何的保证，不过欧洲人要问了：美国人将使一度沦陷到敌人手中去的那些友邦的城市免遭轰炸吗？”
    美军在朝鲜的暴行就可以作为对这个问题的回答。
    苏联拥有原子武器这一事实的再度证实，西欧广大的人士认为这是一个机会，可以促成禁止原子武器问题的解决，从而就加强和平的可能性；显而易见，正是因为这个缘故，美国报纸才对斯大林同志的谈话说到国际管制的那一部分保持缄默或者加以歪曲。为了迷惑舆论起见，它们正在散布一种诽谤性的谰言，硬说苏联不愿对原子武器的生产建立国际管制，因为它反对美国的计划。
    美国和英国的报纸与电台以及西欧国家马歇尔化的报纸都在反复散布这种诽谤。它们这蛮干，厚颜无耻地漠视事实，虽然，只要把联合国大会的报道翻出来看一看，就足够令人确信：苏联在联合国的代表们曾经一贯地为禁止原子武器以及对原子弹生产建立国际管制而努力。
    同时，美国的报纸却透露出美国统治集团对于这
    一事实的忧虑，就是：苏联在管制问题上所采取的立场具有极大的吸引人心的力量，“纽约时报”在十月七日的一篇文章中就曾这样承认。
    该报说：“废除原子弹这种直截了当的说法具有着一种强大的心理上的吸引力。”
    斯大林已经揭露了美国的所谓国际管制计划的欺骗本质，这个计划并不是从禁止原子武器出发，而是从使这种武器合法化出发的；并不是规定停止原子武器的生产，而是规定继续这种武器的生产。同时，斯大林并说：苏联主张建立国际管制，使禁止原子武器和停止生产原子武器的决定得到严格和诚实的执行。
    原子贩子的阴谋已被完全暴露了。他们的喉舌“新闻周刊”杂志并不隐瞒它对这个事实的恼怒，就是：赞成缔结关于禁止原子武器的国际协定的运动终于会越来越强大起来。
    该杂志写道：“我们必须估计到，这个运动可能对某些自由人民发生越来越大的吸引力……我们可能会处于他们日益增强的压力之下，答应不把原子弹用作战略武器，除非俄国人首先使用它。”
    因为苏联已经拥有原子武器，该杂志认为：美国
    “在对俄国的城市投掷原子弹之前应该三思而行”。
    把美、英资产阶级评论员的言论总结起来，我们可以认为：华盛顿方面为回答斯大林的谈话而组织的宣传攻势已经可耻地失败了。十月七日伦敦广播的评论指出：另一次战争煽动者的阵营硬说原子弹仅仅用来轰炸军事目标，这种保证很难再使西欧的普通人民安心，因为，伦敦广播指出，他们显然在仔细研究斯大林的谈话中的每一个字眼，以便从那里发现对原子能建立有效国际管制的一线希望。
    该评论员继称：西欧普通人民对于扩充军备运动的态度是颇为宿命论的。
    然而，那些手忙脚乱的和平的敌人，另一次战争的煽动者和组织者，想涣散各国人民的警觉、想麻痹人民抵制和反对原子计划的意志的那种愿望，在这些言论的结论中是彰明昭著的。
    这都是徒然的希望！人民大众已经并将继续为反对使用和生产原子武器而斗争。这已经由许多事实得到证实了。斯大林同志的谈话证明那些仔细研究这篇谈话每一个字眼的普通人民的愿望是正当的，正如伦敦的评论员也指出了这一点一样。
    世界舆论和各国普通人民都主张禁止使用和生产原子武器，主张对这种禁令建立有效的管制，而不是那虚伪的美国式的管制。对于斯大林就外国报纸关于苏联试验原子弹一事的叫嚣而发表的谈话的种种评论已经证实了这一点。原子贩子们在这一次也遭到了严重的失败。
