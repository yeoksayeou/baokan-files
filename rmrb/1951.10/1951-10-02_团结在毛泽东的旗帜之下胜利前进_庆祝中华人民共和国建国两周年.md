    Advancing Victoriously Under the Banner of Mao Zedong
    —Celebrating the Second Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
    Xu Deheng
    October 1, 1951, is the great and glorious anniversary of the second anniversary of the birth of the People's Republic of China.

    The brilliant victories and rapid progress achieved by the Chinese people in the past two years have surpassed those of previous years in Chinese history. Why have the Chinese people been able to create such great miraculous victories in such a short period of two years? Since the failure of the Opium War, our predecessors have constantly sought truth from the West to save the nation's crisis, but they all failed. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that due to the Russian October Revolution, the Chinese people found the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Since then, Marxism-Leninism has been combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution, giving rise to Mao Zedong Thought, which guides the Chinese revolution. Since the Chinese working class party—the Chinese Communist Party—led the Chinese revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has shown its incomparably brilliant light in every stage of the Chinese revolution. It not only guides the working class to advance towards victory, but also inspires every Chinese person who desires freedom and liberation. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people, after a long and arduous struggle, overthrew the dark rule of feudalism for more than two thousand years, drove away the imperialism that oppressed the Chinese nation for more than a hundred years, and overthrew the twenty-two-year Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bureaucratic fascist reactionary regime. Two years ago today, the People's Republic of China began to appear in the world with an independent and autonomous posture. The people have established their own regime, and the people have become the masters of the country and their own destiny. Therefore, although it has only been a short two years, the people's new China has shone brightly in all aspects.

    First of all, it must be pointed out that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the entire world situation has undergone fundamental changes. The new China, representing 475 million people, resolutely stands on the side of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, which greatly strengthens the force for defending world peace and deals a heavy blow to the aggression plans and war conspiracies carried out by the imperialist bloc headed by the United States throughout the world. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance on February 14, 1950, not only further consolidated the brotherly friendship between China and the Soviet Union, but also issued a serious warning to imperialist countries: if any imperialist dares to launch a war of aggression and undermine peace in the Far East and the world, China and the Soviet Union will definitely guarantee to make joint efforts to take necessary measures to completely defeat the imperialist aggressors. Facts over the past year have proved that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has played a huge role in preventing wars of aggression and maintaining world peace. Taking the Korean War as an example, the true intention of US imperialism to invade Korea is naturally to attempt to use this as a starting point to further invade China, invade Asia, and dominate the world. However, because of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, even if US imperialism wants to expand its war of aggression, it does not dare to do whatever it wants and dare not rashly launch an adventure of war against our country in the face of the powerful and invincible strength of China and the Soviet Union.

    Starting in late October 1950, the Chinese People's Volunteers bravely participated in the Korean people's war against the US in order to protect the security of the motherland and assist our neighbor, Korea, which is as close as lips and teeth; the broad masses of people throughout China also enthusiastically threw themselves into the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Over the past year, the Korean War has fully proved that US imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, with the just assistance of the people of the world, especially the people of China and the Soviet Union, have shattered the frantic attacks of US imperialism, causing the US aggressor army to be mired in a quagmire of defeat from which it cannot extricate itself. In order to save its failure, which it can never save, US imperialism is playing tricks with the so-called armistice negotiations, attempting to use this to buy a respite in order to continue its aggression; at the same time, it is convening an illegal San Francisco Peace Conference with Japan and signing an illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, plotting to use Japan's manpower and material resources as capital for its expansion of its war of aggression.

    The Chinese people love peace. After the World Peace Council's declaration on the requirement that the five major powers conclude a peace pact was issued, from April to July 1951, in just four months, 344,053,057 people signed the declaration, accounting for more than 72% of the total population of the country; the number of people who voted against the United States arming Japan totaled 339,900,392, accounting for 71.5% of the total population of the country. These figures demonstrate the Chinese people's iron will to oppose aggression and defend world peace, just as Premier Zhou of our State Council said, "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been afraid and will never be afraid to resist wars of aggression." Therefore, after the General Association for Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea called for the development of a donation campaign for aircraft and artillery on June 1 this year, in just three months, the weapons pledged by people in various regions have reached 2,482 aircraft, 129 artillery pieces, as well as anti-aircraft guns, tanks, etc. The people's enthusiastic display of patriotism is unprecedented in Chinese history. Not only that, but people in various regions have also combined the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea with the development of patriotic production competitions and thrift movements. Taking only the state-owned enterprises in the Northeast as an example, the original plan was to increase production this year by a value equivalent to 5 million tons of grain, but the current plan has exceeded the value of 10 million tons of grain. Ten million tons of grain is not a small figure, and it can be used to equip 32 new-style yarn factories with 50,000 spindles each, or it can be used to build power stations with 800,000 kilowatts of electricity, or it can be used to purchase more than 213,000 sets of new-style horse-drawn agricultural machinery. If used for national defense construction, it can purchase more than 4,500 jet fighters. From this, it can be seen that the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea not only aided the Korean people in their arduous struggle and struck a blow at the fierce flames of US imperialist aggression, but also promoted our country's economic construction and national defense construction.

    The movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea over the past year has also been a profound political education for the people of the whole country. It has eliminated the pro-US, worship-US, and fear-US thinking of some people, and the vast majority of people have further recognized the brutal and cowardly face of US imperialism, and have established a thought of hatred, contempt, and disdain for it. Patriotic education has penetrated into any remote areas and remote villages. Everyone knows that US imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. After the representatives of our Volunteer Army returned to China from Korea, they made communication reports to more than 900 counties and cities across the country. Wherever they went, they aroused the enthusiastic love of the broad masses of people. Thirty million people directly heard their reports, and these thirty million people communicated the reports to the masses they contacted. This is such a broad and vivid political education. In addition, after the representatives of our people's delegation to Korea returned to China, they also went to various places to make communication reports. Their footprints traveled all over the provinces and cities, and countless people directly and indirectly heard their reports.

    Secondly, Chairman Mao taught us: "We must resolutely eliminate all bandits, secret agents, local bullies, and other counter-revolutionaries who endanger the people." Chairman Mao also pointed out: "All these counter-revolutionary activities are instigated behind the scenes by imperialism, especially US imperialism. These bandits, secret agents, and spies are all running dogs of imperialism." Facts over the past two years have proved that Chairman Mao's instruction is 100% correct.

    After the Chinese people destroyed the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary dynasty supported by US imperialism, US imperialism was unwilling to accept its failure, so it instructed secret agents, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries to oppose the Chinese people, determined to be enemies of the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people are well aware of all the sabotage conspiracies of US imperialism. Under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese people have conducted extensive denunciations and strict suppression of US-Chiang secret agents, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries, and have basically eliminated bandits, local bullies, secret agents, traitors, and reactionary secret societies. The People's Government has also severely dealt with the secret agents and spies of US imperialism, and executed US secret agents and spies Li An Dong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi. This incident told the imperialists that the Chinese people who have stood up cannot be humiliated. The dark era in which imperialism used extraterritoriality to run rampant and do evil in China is gone forever. The Chinese people have full confidence and strength to defeat all the sabotage and provocative acts of imperialism.

    In the past two years, all bandits, secret agents, spies, traitors, local bullies, and reactionary secret societies have been subjected to the suppression and punishment they deserve, which has greatly consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, guaranteed the victorious fruits of the people's revolution, and guaranteed the smooth progress of production and construction. The people have also generally realized that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is inseparable from resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, is inseparable from land reform to defeat the feudal landlord class, and is inseparable from the construction and consolidation of the people's democratic regime. Therefore, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has also promoted the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and democratic nation-building. In terms of regime construction, taking only the county and city level as an example, as of now, 2,239 county, city, and banner people's governments have been established across the country. Two thousand one hundred and fifteen counties or administrative units equivalent to counties across the country have held people's representative conferences or people's congresses of all walks of life. Through the people's representative conferences and people's congresses, the people's political awareness has been continuously improved, the people's democratic united front has been gradually expanded, and the people's democratic regime has been further consolidated.

    In addition, it must be pointed out that because the regime is in the hands of the people, this regime is not only unusually consolidated, but also truly serves the people and proceeds from the interests of the people and the country in everything. Such a regime will of course produce many unprecedented miracles, such as land reform. As of now, land reform has been completed in areas with a rural population of more than 310 million across the country; land reform will soon be completed in areas with a population of about 100 million. In just two years, there has been a major reversal in Chinese history. The feudal landlord class has been defeated, the bandits have been basically eliminated, the farmers' political awareness has been universally improved, and they have truly become the masters of the country, engaged in production and labor on their own land, thus greatly improving their enthusiasm for production. This not only leads the entire social economy towards rebirth and prosperity, and improves the lives of farmers, but also lays a good foundation for our country's industrialization. For example, in the first year of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government led the people of the whole country to basically overcome the serious natural disasters caused by the long-term corrupt rule of imperialism, feudalism, and the Kuomintang reactionary group. This year, the Central People's Government mobilized 3 million people to thoroughly harness the Huai River and successfully completed the first phase of the project plan. The second phase of the project plan is about to begin. The Huai River basin, which has been plagued by natural disasters for many years, has now become the people's granary. This situation can only occur in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party, our country, which has lacked agricultural products for many years, has had surplus grain to help India after only two years. Foreign trade, which has always had huge deficits, has seen a surplus for the first time in 73 years since liberation. The despicable tricks of imperialism attempting to increase our difficulties through blockade and bombing have failed shamefully.

    The peaceful liberation of Tibet is also a major event of the past year. Since then, the Tibetan brothers who have long suffered from the shackles and oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government have returned to the embrace of the motherland and lived a free and happy life. The peaceful liberation of Tibet is another great victory for Mao Zedong's ethnic policy.

    As we celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the country today, in addition to cheering for the brilliant victories of the People's Republic of China in the past two years, in order to further consolidate and expand this victory, we must also work hard to complete the following tasks:

    First, step up the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and defeat the aggression of US imperialism. Although the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime supported by US imperialism has been destroyed by the Chinese people, and US imperialism has suffered a shameful defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, it has not repented. It is still frantically attacking the Korean people and still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, resolutely opposing the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. Therefore, the people of our entire country must continue to step up the sacred struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, must continue to develop the patriotic production increase and donation movement, and must work hard to do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. We must do everything in our power to support the Korean people's war against the US, strive to consolidate our motherland's national defense, and completely cut off the spearhead of US imperialist aggression pointing at our country. We must work hard to prepare for the liberation of Taiwan. We must further unite with the Korean people, the Japanese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people in the world to defeat our common enemy—US imperialism—and completely defeat all the aggressive plans of US imperialism!

    Second, we must strengthen our learning, learn from the Chinese Communist Party, and learn from the great leader Chairman Mao. We know that the reason why the Chinese people's liberation war won such a great victory and the new China has achieved such brilliant achievements is inseparable from the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and is inseparable from Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, in order to consolidate and develop the victory of the people's revolution, in order to improve ourselves, we must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improve our ideological level and work level, and must work hard to learn the Chinese Communist Party's work style of being arduous and indomitable, sacrificing and striving, being modest and prudent, and serving the people wholeheartedly. Our cultural, educational, and scientific workers must unite more closely, strive to implement patriotic education, develop a national, scientific, and popular culture, master progressive theories and technologies, closely integrate with reality, and serve the people and national construction. Our intellectuals must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, go to the workers and peasants, learn from the workers and peasants, and serve the workers and peasants.

    Third, our Jiusan Society must, under the guidance and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and friendly parties, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, further unite the broad masses of cultural, educational, and scientific workers, further consolidate and develop our organization, work hard to do a good job in the united front, and expand and strengthen the strength of the united front. Although we have done some work in the united front in the past, our work is obviously not enough and needs to take a further step on the existing basis. All our members should recognize that our task is glorious and arduous at the same time, and must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong, and strive to thoroughly realize the Common Program and build a new democratic China!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the people's leader Chairman Mao!

    团结在毛泽东的旗帜之下胜利前进
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国建国两周年
    许德珩
    一九五一年十月一日，是中华人民共和国诞生两周年伟大光辉的纪念日。
    两年以来，中国人民所获得的辉煌的胜利和飞跃的进步。超过了中国历史上已往的若干年月。中国人民为什么在短短的两年间能够创造如此伟大的胜利奇迹呢？自从鸦片战争失败以后，我们的先辈为了挽救民族的危机，不断地向西方寻找真理，可是他们都失败了。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中指出：由于俄国十月革命，中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个普遍真理。从此，马克思列宁主义和中国革命的实践相结合起来，产生了指导中国革命的毛泽东思想。自从中国工人阶级的政党——中国共产党领导中国革命，毛泽东思想在中国革命的每一阶段都显出了灿烂无比的光辉。它不但指导工人阶级不断地向着胜利前进，而且鼓舞着每一个要求自由解放的中国人民。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀之下，中国人民经过了长期的艰苦斗争，把两千多年封建的黑暗统治打倒了，把百余年压迫中华民族的帝国主义赶跑了，把二十二年的国民党蒋介石官僚法西斯反动政权推翻了，两年前的今天，中华人民共和国开始以独立、自主的姿态出现于世界。人民建立了自己的政权，人民也就成为国家和个人命运的主人。因之，虽然只是短短的两年，人民的新中国在各方面都显得光芒万丈。
    首先必须指出：中华人民共和国成立以后，整个的世界局势起了根本的变化。代表四亿七千五百万人民的新中国坚决地站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营方面，这就大大地增强了保卫世界和平的力量，而对于美国为首的帝国主义集团在全世界所进行的侵略计划和战争阴谋，则是一个极沉重的打击。一九五○年二月十四日中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订不但进一步地巩固了中苏两大国兄弟般的友谊，而且向帝国主义国家发出严重的警告：任何帝国主义如敢于发动侵略战争，破坏远东和世界和平，中苏两国一定保证共同尽力采取必要的措施，彻底打败帝国主义侵略者。一年多来的事实证明：中苏友好同盟互助条约在制止侵略战争、维护世界和平方面，发挥了极大的效用。试以朝鲜战争为例，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的真正意图，自然是妄想以此为起点进一步来侵略中国，侵略亚洲，独霸世界。但因为有了中苏友好同盟互助条约，美帝国主义纵欲扩大侵略战争，在中苏两国强大无敌的力量之前，也就不敢为所欲为，不敢贸然对我国发动战争的冒险。
    一九五○年十月下旬起，中国人民志愿军为了保卫祖国的安全，和援助与我们唇齿相依的邻邦朝鲜，英勇地参加了朝鲜人民的抗美战争；全中国广大的人民也轰轰烈烈地投入了抗美援朝运动。年余以来，朝鲜的战争完全证明了美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在全世界人民特别是中苏两国人民的正义援助之下，已经粉碎了美帝国主义疯狂的进攻，使美国侵略军陷在失败的泥沼中不能自拔。美帝国主义为了挽救它永远不能挽救的失败，竟一面玩弄所谓停战谈判的花样，企图以此来换取一个喘息的时间，以便继续侵略；一面召开非法的旧金山对日和会，签订非法的单独对日和约，阴谋利用日本的人力物力，来为它扩大侵略战争的赌本。
    中国人民是爱好和平的。世界和平理事会关于要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言发表后，从一九五一年四月到七月短短的四个月时间，在宣言上签名的即有三亿四千四百零五万三千零五十七人，占全国总人口百分之七十二强；投票反对美国武装日本的人数，共有三亿三千九百九十万零三千零九十二人，占全国总人口百分之七十一点五。这些数字说明了中国人民反对侵略，保卫世界和平的钢铁意志，正如我政务院周总理所说“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争”。因之，抗美援朝总会本年六月一日号召开展捐献飞机大炮运动之后，仅仅三个月的时间，各地人民认捐的武器已达飞机二千四百八十二架，大炮一百二十九门，以及高射炮、坦克等。人民如此热烈地发挥爱国主席的精神是中国历史上空前所未有的。不但如此，各地人民还结合抗美援朝运动，开展了爱国主义的生产竞赛和节约运动。仅就东北的国营企业来说，原定今年增产价值等于五百万吨的粮食，但现在的计划已超过一千万吨粮食的价值。一千万吨粮食不是一个很小的数字，可以用来装备拥有五万枚纱锭的新式纱厂三十二所，或可建立拥有八十万千瓦电力的发电站，或可购买新式马拉机械农具二十一万三千余套。如用之于国防建设，可购买喷气式战斗机四千五百余架。由此可见，抗美援朝运动不但援助了艰苦战斗的朝鲜人民，打击了美帝国主义侵略的凶焰，同时推动了我国的经济建设和国防建设。
    一年来的抗美援朝运动对全国人民也是一种深刻的政治教育。它肃清了一部分人的亲美、崇美、恐美思想，绝大多数的人进一步认识了美帝国主义的凶暴而卑怯的面目，对它建立了仇视、鄙视和蔑视的思想。爱国主义教育深入到任何偏远的地区和偏僻的乡村。任何人都知道美帝国主义是中国人民和世界人民的死敌。我志愿军代表由朝鲜返国后，向全国九百多个县市进行了传达报告，他们每到一处，都引起了广大群众的热烈爱戴，直接听到他们报告的达三千万人，这三千万人又传达给他们所联系的群众。这是多么广泛而生动的政治教育。此外，我国人民赴朝慰问团代表回国后，也到各处进行传达报告，他们的足迹遍历各省市，直接间接听到他们的报告的人无算。
    其次，毛主席教导我们：“必须坚决地肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子。”毛主席又指出：“所有这些反革命活动，都有帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在背后策动。这些土匪、特务和间谍，都是帝国主义的走狗。”两年来的事实证明，毛主席这个指示是百分之百正确的。
    中国人民把美帝国主义所扶植的蒋介石反动王朝摧毁之后，美帝国主义不甘心它的失败，乃指使特务、间谍和其他反革命分子来反对中国人民，决心与中国人民为敌。但中国人民是洞悉美帝国主义的一切破坏阴谋的。中国人民在中央人民政府的正确领导之下，对美、蒋特务、间谍和一切反革命分子进行了广泛的检举和严厉的镇压，基本地肃清了土匪、恶霸、特务、汉奸和反动会道门。人民政府并严厉地处置了美帝国主义的特务、间谍，枪毙了美国特务间谍李安东和山口隆一。这件事告诉了帝国主义者：站起来了的中国人民是不可侮的。帝国主义利用治外法权在中国横行霸道、为非作歹的黑暗的时代是一去不复返了。中国人民有充分的信心和力量打败帝国主义的一切破坏和挑衅行为。
    两年以来，一切土匪、特务、间谍、汉奸、恶霸、反动会道门，遭受到应得的镇压和惩治，这就大大地巩固了人民民主专政，保障了人民革命的胜利果实，保障了生产建设的顺利进行。人民并普遍地认识到：镇压反革命是和抗美援朝分不开的，是和土地改革打垮封建地主阶级分不开的，是和人民民主政权的建设和巩固分不开的。因之，镇压反革命同时也推进了抗美援朝和土地改革及民主建政的工作。在政权建设方面，仅就县市一级来说，截至目前为止，全国已成立了二千二百三十九个县、市、旗人民政府。全国已有二千一百一十五个县或相当于县的行政单位开过各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会。经过人民代表会议和人民代表大会，人民的政治觉悟不断提高，人民民主统一战线逐渐扩大，人民民主政权也进一步巩固起来。
    此外，必须指出：因为政权掌握在人民手里，这个政权不但异常巩固，而且确实替人民办事，一切从人民和国家的利益出发。这样的政权当然会产生许多空前未有的奇迹，例如土地改革，截至现在为止，全国已有三亿一千万以上农业人口的地区完成了土地改革；还有一亿左右人口的地区即将完成土地改革。在短短的两年，中国历史来了一个大翻身。封建地主阶级打垮了，土匪基本地消灭了，农民的政治觉悟普遍地提高了，他们已真正成为国家的主人，在自己的土地上从事生产劳动，因而大大地提高了他们生产的积极性。这样，不但使整个社会经济走向新生和繁荣，使农民生活获得改善，而且为我国工业化奠定了良好的基础。又例如：在中华人民共和国成立的头一年，中央人民政府就领导全国人民基本地战胜了帝国主义、封建主义和国民党反动集团长期的腐烂统治所造成的严重灾荒。今年，中央人民政府又动员了三百万人去根治淮河，胜利地完成了第一期的工程计划。第二期工程计划即将开始。年年灾荒的淮河流域，现在已成为人民的谷仓。这种情形只有在共产党领导下的新中国才会出现。由于中央人民政府和共产党的英明领导，多年以来农产物不够的我国，只经过两年时间，便有了余粮接济印度。一向巨额入超的对外贸易，解放以后，出现了七十三年以来未有的出超。帝国主义企图用封锁和轰炸来增加我们的困难的卑劣伎俩是可耻地失败了。
    西藏的和平解放也是一年以来的一件大事。从此，长期遭受帝国主义和国民党反动政府的羁绊与压迫的西藏兄弟民族回到祖国的怀抱，过着自由幸福的生活。西藏和平解放，是毛泽东民族政策又一次伟大的胜利。
    当我们庆祝建国两周年的今天，我们除了为中华人民共和国两年来的辉煌的胜利而欢呼之外，为了进一步巩固和扩大这个胜利，我们还必须努力完成下述任务：
    第一、加紧抗美援朝工作，打垮美帝国主义的侵略。美帝国主义扶持的蒋介石反动政权虽然被中国人民摧毁了，美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争中虽然受到可耻的失败；但它并没有悔祸之心，它还在疯狂地进攻朝鲜人民，还在霸占我国领土台湾，坚决地与中朝人民和世界人民为敌。因此，我们全国的人民就必须继续加紧抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争，必须继续开展爱国增产捐献运动，必须努力做好优待烈属军属的工作。我们必须尽我们所有的力量支援朝鲜人民抗美的战争，努力巩固我们祖国的国防，把指向我国的美帝国主义的侵略矛头彻底斩断。我们必须努力做好解放台湾的准备工作。我们必须进一步地和朝鲜人民，日本人民，亚洲人民及全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，打倒我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义，彻底打败美帝国主义的一切侵略计划！
    第二，我们要加强学习，向中国共产党学习，向伟大的领袖毛主席学习。我们知道，中国人民解放战争之所以赢得如此伟大的胜利以及新中国之所以获得如此辉煌的成就，是和毛主席和共产党的正确领导分不开的，是和马克思列宁主义与毛泽东思想分不开的。因此，为了巩固和发展人民革命的胜利，为了提高我们自己，我们必须努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，提高我们的思想水平和工作水平，必须努力学习中国共产党坚苦卓绝，牺牲奋斗，谦虚谨慎，全心全意为人民服务的工作作风。我们文教科学工作者要更加紧密地团结起来，努力实施爱国主义的教育，发展民族的，科学的，大众的文化，掌握进步的理论和技术，密切结合实际，为人民和国家建设服务。我们知识分子必须遵照毛主席的指示，到工农群众中去，向工农学习，为工农服务。
    第三，我们九三学社必须在中国共产党和各友党的指导和协助之下，在毛主席的英明领导之下，进一步团结广大的文教科学工作者，进一步巩固和发展我们的组织，努力做好统一战线工作，扩大和加强统一战线的力量。我们过去在统一战线中虽然做了些微工作；但我们的工作显然还做得不够，还需要在现有的基础上迈进一步。我们全体社员应认清我们的任务是光荣的，同时是艰巨的，必须更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，在毛泽东的胜利旗帜之下，为彻底实现共同纲领，建设新民主主义的新中国而奋斗！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    人民领袖毛主席万岁！
