Me, Two Years Before and After
Wen Zhilin, a Woman from the Sixth District of Beijing

Two years ago, I was a housewife in the old society, like a mouse, always burrowing in a hole, only dealing with pots and pans. No major event could move me. I felt life was hard, constantly calculating the rice in the barrel and the oil in the bottle. I hated my father when I thought about it, how he neglected his wife and children because of his opium addiction. When the craving came, he would either beat the children or scold his wife.

From the time I got married, I never felt happy, always feeling stifled. Back then, I wouldn't dare mention divorce! Not to mention others, even my own father would have buried me alive. I cried so much every day that my eyes were like red beads. When would such days end? In a moment of desperation, I stopped eating for three days. My father-in-law found out and sent me back to my parents' home. Not long after returning, I received a letter informing me that my husband had died of dysentery from opium use. My father, upon hearing this, told me to quickly go back, saying, "Even though your husband is dead, you must go back quickly, otherwise gossip will spread, and it won't be good for the reputation of our old Wen family." In the end, my father also instructed me to be filial to my in-laws and to observe chastity in the Zhu family. I agreed to all of this.

When my husband was alive, I was a "poor woman"; after my husband died, I became a "poor widow," and life was even harder. I was so poor that I couldn't make ends meet. The Kuomintang's Baojia chief even came to collect "city defense fees" and "conscription fees." Having no other choice, I went to wash clothes for others. Afraid that the neighbors would gossip, saying that a widow running around must not be "keeping" herself, I lied and said, "I went to my sister's house to borrow money." I struggled through life, day by day, afraid to think about the future.

Just when I was at a dead end, Beijing was liberated, and many women went to work in factories. I heard people in the neighborhood say, "The People's Liberation Army treats men and women the same!" Driven to desperation by life, I went to work, widow or not. When I first arrived at the factory, I wasn't used to it. The comrades in the factory often told us about how women were oppressed in the old society and often helped me learn. Gradually, I realized that my suffering was caused by the old society and that the Communist Party was for the benefit of the people.

Last October 1st, I participated in the National Day celebration. It was the first time I had seen such a lively scene. People were shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" For many years, I had never dared to speak loudly in front of people. This time, I shouted until my voice was hoarse. As I approached Tiananmen Square, my heart beat faster and faster. When I saw Chairman Mao, it was like a window had been opened in my heart, and all the years of pent-up anger were released. My tears flowed uncontrollably. I thought to myself: I am a widow, and people consider me a harbinger of bad luck, afraid that I will "jinx" any happy occasion. Today, I was able to participate in this National Day celebration and see Chairman Mao. I truly felt liberated.

Since returning from the National Day celebration, my enthusiasm for work has been greater than before. After finishing my own work, I help others. Seeing how active I was, everyone made me an administrator. I happily went home and told my father-in-law, "In the new society, I have become a useful person." When the factory didn't have work, I organized the military dependents to engage in production, finding them work such as washing clothes, making shoe soles, and patching rubber. While taking on the work, I also mobilized military dependents who were unwilling to work to participate in production. The military dependents in the production team all loved me and called me Sister-in-law Zhu. At the end of the year, when the district was selecting role models, I was selected.

I felt that solving the production problems of military dependents alone was not enough. I also helped them solve marriage problems. Therefore, I also became a member of the preparatory committee of the Sixth District Democratic Women's Federation.

I am not afraid of being tired when I do things, but I always feel that "women" are not good at anything and cannot come up with any brilliant ideas. The comrades in the district know my shortcomings and often help me and help me solve problems. In this way, I learned how to identify and solve problems. Once, the Civil Affairs Bureau held a meeting to discuss production issues. The attendees were all cadres. When I offered my opinion, everyone listened carefully. I felt that women were truly equal to men.

Chairman Mao: How can I thank you! You saved me from the pit of death, you turned me from a useless person into a useful one.

The new society has given me liberation. I will always love our new society and love our motherland!

    两年前后的我
    北京市第六区妇女  温芝琳
    两年前，我是个旧社会的家庭妇女，像耗子似的，成天钻在洞里，只是和锅碗瓢盆打交道。什么大事也惊动不了我。我觉得日子不好过，天天算计桶里的米和瓶里的油。想起来就恨我爹，怎么把我给了这么个“主”。他吸白面吸得连老婆孩子都不管了；上来瘾不是打孩子，就是骂老婆。
    从结了婚，我心里就没有痛快过，老是窝窝囊囊的。那时候我那敢提离婚呀！不用说别人，就是我父亲也得把我活埋了。我成天哭得眼睛像红珠珠似的。这样的日子什么时候是个头？一狠心我绝了三天食。公公知道了，就把我送回娘家去。回到娘家不久，我接到来信，知道丈夫得烟痢死了。我父亲一听，就叫我快点回去，他说：“丈夫死了，可得快点回去，要出了闲话也不是玩的，对咱们老温家的门风可不好。”最后父亲还嘱咐我，要好好孝顺公婆，要在朱家守节。这些我都答应了。
    丈夫活着时我是“穷娘们”；丈夫死了，我又成了“穷寡妇”，日子可难对付，穷得上头接不上下头，国民党的保甲长还来要“城防费”、“征兵费”；没有办法，就去给旁人洗衣裳。怕街坊邻居出闲话，说寡妇乱串门，准是“守”不住了，我就撒谎说：“我到姐姐家借钱去了。”我一顿一顿地对付着过日子，不敢往前想。
    正当我走头无路的时候，北京解放了，好多妇女都去工厂做工。听街坊上的人说：“解放军对待男女，都是一样！”我被生活逼得无路可走，不管寡妇不寡妇的，也去做了工。刚到工厂的时候，我有些过不惯。工厂里的同志常给我们讲旧社会里的妇女怎样受压迫；也常帮助我学习。渐渐地，我知道了我的苦是旧社会给我的，也知道了共产党是为了老百姓的。
    去年十月一日，我参加了国庆节纪念会。我第一次见到这么热闹的场面，人们都在喊毛主席万岁。多少年来，我在人面前没敢大声说过话，这一次我也把嗓子喊哑了。在快走到天安门前的时候，我的心跳得一下比一下紧，一看见毛主席，我心里就像开了窗子似的，多少年的闷气都泄出来了，我的眼泪止不住地往下流。心想：我这个寡妇，人家都认为我是不祥之物，有喜事都怕我“冲”了，今天我也能参加这个国庆节，又看见了毛主席，我真觉得我翻身了。
    从参加国庆节回来，我工作的劲头比过去更大了，我自己做完了，就去帮着别人做。大家看我很积极，就让我当管理员，我高兴地回家对公公说：“在新社会里我变成一个有用的人了。”工厂没有活时，我就组织军属生产，想法给军属找活：洗衣服，纳鞋底，胶皮子。我一边揽活，一边动员不愿作活的军属参加生产。生产小组的军属都很爱我，称我朱大嫂。年底区上评选模范的时候，把我评上了。
    我觉得光解决军属的生产问题是不够的。我还帮助他们解决婚姻问题，因此我又当上了第六区民主妇女联合会筹备委员会的筹备委员。
    让我干事我不怕累，但我总是觉得“娘们家”不行，出不了什么高明的主意。区里的同志知道我这个缺点，就常常帮助我，有问题帮助我解决。这样我学会了怎样发现问题和解决问题，有一次民政局召开会议，讨论生产问题。出席的人都是些干部。在我提意见的时候，大家都很注意听，我觉得妇女真的和男子平等了。
    毛主席：我怎样感激你！是你把我从死人坑里救出来了，是你把我从一个废物变成了有用的人。
    新社会使我得到了翻身，我要永远爱我们的新社会，爱我们的祖国！
