The Supreme People's Court Central-South Branch has concluded the case of Liang Yongshi and his mother murdering Liang Anshi in Suixian County, Henan Province, two years ago after exhuming and examining the bones and conducting a clear trial. The murderers, Liang Wangshi and Liang Yongshi, have been executed by firing squad.

Liang Wangshi, 48 years old, a middle peasant from Shaopen Lizhuang Village, 12 li south of Suixian County, Henan Province, was known for her fierce nature, earning nicknames such as "Mother Night-Demon," "Living閻王 (Yánwáng, King of Hell)," "Mother Tiger," and "Red-Faced Lion." Her eldest son, Liang Yongshi, was a former Kuomintang secret agent who had robbed the masses. The mother and son were extremely domineering in the village.

In October 1944, Liang Yongshi married the granddaughter of An Chongshan from Xiangzhang Village (the victim, Liang Anshi). Their relationship was poor after the marriage, and Liang Anshi was often abused by her mother-in-law and husband. Ten months after the marriage, Liang Anshi gave birth to a son named Dengyun. Liang Wangshi disliked Liang Anshi for giving birth too early, insisted that the child was born out of wedlock, and often cursed and pinched the child. In July 1947 (lunar calendar), Liang Anshi, unable to bear the abuse, attempted suicide by jumping into a well in Lizhuang Village, but was rescued. After this, Liang Wangshi and her son abused Liang Anshi and her son even more. Soon after, on August 13th, Dengyun was thrown by Liang Yongshi and was half-dead, dying the next day. After receiving the news, Liang Anshi's family sent people to take her away and reported Liang Yongshi to the then puppet government, filing a lawsuit. Liang Anshi, fearing beatings and scolding from Liang Yongshi and his mother, stayed in her parents' home for nine months.

In May 1948, Liang Anshi moved to her aunt's house in Luolou Village. Liang Yongshi asked someone to intercede and brought Liang Anshi back. After this, Liang Yongshi's attitude changed slightly, but Liang Anshi was still often abused by Liang Wangshi's instigation. On July 9, 1949, Liang Anshi gave birth to a daughter, who died of umbilical sepsis five days later. Liang Wangshi said that Liang Anshi had intentionally harmed her young daughter and plotted to kill Liang Anshi. Soon after, on the third day of the intercalary seventh lunar month, Liang Anshi stepped on a duckling and killed it, prompting Liang Wangshi to incite Liang Yongshi to scold Liang Anshi severely. That night, as autumn rain fell, Liang Yongshi's father and second brother were not at home, and Liang Wangshi and her son murdered Liang Anshi. Liang Wangshi held down Liang Anshi's legs, and Liang Yongshi strangled Liang Anshi's neck with a rope. After strangling her, fearing that Liang Anshi was not dead, he stabbed an iron needle for threading wool into Liang Anshi's vagina. After Liang Anshi died, Liang Wangshi and her son hung the corpse on the kitchen stove, pretending that Liang Anshi had hanged herself, to cover up their crime. When Liang Anshi's family arrived, they saw that Anshi's one hand was hanging down and the other was holding her chest, her lower body was bleeding, and her left face was blue, which was not the appearance of someone who had hanged herself, so they reported it to the Fourth District People's Government. At this time, Liang Yongshi colluded with the village cadres and arranged in the farmers' association that when the masses saw outsiders, they should say that Liang Anshi had hanged herself or say that they did not know.

Xuan Yuanzunyan, the deputy district chief of the Fourth District, arrived at Shaopen Lizhuang Village the day after receiving the report to examine the corpse. However, Xuan Yuanzunyan adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the case and only based on the rope marks on the deceased's neck and the conversations of some people to judge that Liang Anshi had committed suicide by hanging. The next day, Liang Anshi's family asked for a re-examination and to check the lower part of the deceased's body, but Xuan Yuanzunyan refused.

Liang Anshi's grandfather, An Chongshan, refused to accept this and sued the Suixian County People's Government. Chen Beichang, a clerk from the Judicial Section of the Suixian County People's Government, was sent to examine the corpse. Chen returned to the county government halfway after hearing that "the corpse had rotted." Guo Yongfu, the head of the Judicial Section, also believed that Liang Anshi had committed suicide by hanging based on Xuan Yuanzunyan's report and released Liang Yongshi after detaining him for thirty-eight days. An Chongshan was dissatisfied and filed a complaint with the Henan Daily and the Henan Provincial People's Court. Afterwards, the Suixian County People's Government detained Liang Wangshi and Liang Yongshi again. In January 1950, clues to the case were obtained from Liang Yongshi's sister-in-law's testimony. On January 21 of the same year, Liang Wangshi and her son confessed to the truth of murdering Liang Anshi. Afterwards, Liang Wangshi and her son confessed their mistakes to the masses in the village.

In February 1950, the Shangqiu Prefecture transferred the case to the Prefecture People's Court for trial. Liang Wangshi and her son, believing that they had left the county and could take advantage of the situation, overturned their original confessions. The Shangqiu Prefecture People's Court did not pay enough attention to the case and even mistakenly believed that Liang Yongshi was an "honest farmer" and An Chongshan was a "litigation trickster," favoring Liang Wangshi and her son. The case was delayed for half a year without a final resolution. In July of the same year, the Henan Provincial People's Court, based on the confessions of the criminals, the testimony of Liang Yongshi's sister-in-law, the investigation by the Suixian Democratic Women's Federation and the Public Security Bureau, and the judgment of the Suixian County Magistrate, instructed the Shangqiu Prefecture People's Court to sentence Liang Yongshi to death and Liang Wangshi to fifteen years in prison. However, the Shangqiu Prefecture People's Court did not promptly handle the case in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities. The Henan Provincial Democratic Women's Federation repeatedly urged the Provincial People's Court and convened a joint discussion of the case by women's federation cadres and judicial cadres at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels in October of the same year. This meeting did not produce results due to differing opinions among the judicial cadres of the prefecture and county.

In January 1951, the Henan Provincial People's Court retrieved the case and still sentenced Liang Yongshi to death and Liang Wangshi to fifteen years in prison. Liang Wangshi refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, falsely claiming: "Liang Anshi accidentally stepped on and killed a duckling. We just scolded her a few times. Liang Anshi was petty and angry, and hanged herself. Liang Yongxing, Liang Kongchen, and Liang Yongbin from our village can testify to taking down the body. The marks on her buttocks were from bumping against the stove while taking down the body, and the blood in her pants was from breaking her 'qi dan' (hidden disease) when taking down the body." She also said that her confessions in the county were coerced.

On December 1, 1950, the Central-South Democratic Women's Federation sent people to discuss the case with the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court. The Central-South Branch sent a letter to the Henan Provincial People's Court on December 24 of the same month to investigate the case, and received the case file and Liang Yongshi's appeal on February 23, 1951. After accepting the case, the Central-South Branch, due to the unclear examination and judgment in the original case file, handed over the relevant materials to the forensic doctor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Court for research on June 24, believing that it was necessary to examine the bones to determine the cause of Liang Anshi's death. The Henan Provincial People's Court also agreed to the examination of the bones. On August 31, the Central-South Branch sent three judges to Shaopen Lizhuang Village with relevant personnel to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and understand the truth. On September 9th and 10th, the coffin was publicly opened to steam the bones for examination. It was found that the second and fourth spinal bones below Anshi's head had faint blood marks, the fontanelle bones had dark marks, and the four spaces below the square bone were all blue-purple, indicating that she had been strangled to death and had suffered serious injuries to her vagina.

After the case was clarified, a public trial meeting of more than 20,000 people was held in Suixian County on September 14 for a four-level public trial. At the meeting, cadres from Shaopen Lizhuang Village and those who took down the body testified to Liang Anshi's murder, and women's federation cadres and Liang Anshi's mother made accusations. The masses were extremely enthusiastic and tense. The murderers, Liang Wangshi and Liang Yongshi, were executed by firing squad on the spot.

After the verdict, the masses were very pleased. They said, "The People's Government is truly working for the people." "The People's Government is truly just." Through the trial of this case, the masses also realized that Liang Anshi's death was due to the unreasonable feudal marriage system and that only by thoroughly implementing the Marriage Law can women truly achieve liberation.

    最高人民法院中南分院判决谋杀梁安氏案
    虐杀妇女凶犯经公审枪决
    二年前河南省睢县梁永诗母子谋杀梁安氏一案，已经最高人民法院中南分院蒸骨验尸审判明白，并将杀人凶犯梁王氏、梁永诗两犯执行枪决。
    梁王氏现年四十八岁，中农，住河南省睢县城南十二里烧盆李庄村；凶狠成性，人称“母夜叉”、“活阎王”、“母老虎”、“红脸狮子”等。长子梁永诗，曾任国民党密探，抢劫过群众。母子二人在村中极其霸道。
    一九四四年十月，梁永诗与香张村安崇山的孙女
    （即被害的梁安氏）结婚。婚后双方感情不好，梁安氏常受婆婆和丈夫的虐待。婚后十个月，梁安氏生一子名登云。梁王氏嫌梁安氏生子过早，硬说此子为非婚生子，时常咒骂并拧打孩子。一九四七年旧历七月，梁安氏因不堪虐待，曾在李庄村跳井自杀，幸被人救出未死。此后，梁王氏母子对梁安氏母子更加虐待。不久，八月十三日，登云被梁永诗摔得半死，次日死去。梁安氏娘家得讯后派人接走梁安氏，并在当时的伪政府告发梁永诗，打了一场官司。梁安氏因怕梁永诗母子打骂，这次在娘家住了九个月。
    一九四八年五月，梁安氏移居罗楼村姑母家。梁永诗托人说情，将梁安氏接回。此后，梁永诗态度稍有转变，但仍常受梁王氏的挑拨虐打梁安氏。一九四九年七月九日梁安氏生一女，五天后孩子得脐风病死去。梁王氏说梁安氏有意暗害幼女，便存杀害梁安氏之意。不久，旧历闰七月初三日，梁安氏因踩死一只小鸭，梁王氏挑唆梁永诗大骂梁安氏一顿。当晚，正下秋雨，梁永诗的父亲和二弟都不在家，梁王氏母子二人便下手谋害梁安氏。梁王氏压住梁安氏双腿，梁永诗用绳猛勒梁安氏颈部；勒后又怕梁安氏不死，将一根打绒线的铁针扎入梁安氏阴户。梁安氏死后，梁王氏母子二人将尸首吊在厨房锅台上，假做梁安氏上吊而死，掩盖自己的罪行。梁安氏娘家的来人看出安氏一手下垂，一手抱胸，下部流血，左脸发青，并非吊死形状，遂报告第四区人民政府。此时，梁永诗拉拢本村干部，在农会布置，要群众见到外人时就说梁安氏系上吊而死，或说不知道。
    第四区副区长轩辕尊言于接到报告后的次日到烧盆李庄村验尸。但轩辕尊言对此案采取了不负责任的态度，只依据死者颈部有绳痕和某些人的谈话，便判断梁安氏系自缢身死。次日，梁安氏娘家人要求复验，查看死者下部，被轩辕尊言拒绝。
    梁安氏的祖父安崇山不服，告到睢县人民政府。睢县人民政府司法科科员陈北昌被派前往验尸。陈行至中途，听人说“尸首已腐烂”，便返回县府。司法科科长郭永福根据轩辕尊言的报告，也认为梁安氏系自缢身死，将梁永诗扣押三十八天后释放。安崇山不满，又向河南日报、河南省人民法院提出控诉，之后，睢县人民政府又将梁王氏、梁永诗扣押。至一九五○年一月，由梁永诗弟媳口中讯出此案线索；同年一月二十一日，梁王氏母子供出谋杀梁安氏实情。之后，梁王氏母子曾在本村向群众坦白认错。
    一九五○年二月，商邱专署将此案调至专区人民法院审理。梁王氏母子以为离开本县，有机可乘，便推翻了原供。商邱专区人民法院对此案不够重视，甚至错误地认为梁永诗为“老实农民”，安崇山是“官司油子”，偏袒梁王氏母子。此案拖延半年之久未做最后处理。同年七月，河南省人民法院根据犯人口供，梁永诗弟媳的证明，睢县民主妇女联合会、公安局的调查，及睢县县长的判断，指示商邱专区人民法院判梁永诗以死刑，判梁王氏以十五年徒刑。但商邱专区人民法院并未遵照上级意见及时处理。河南省民主妇女联合会曾几次敦促省人民法院，并于同年十月召开省、专区、县三级妇联干部、司法干部共同讨论此案。这次会议，因专区、县的司法干部有不同意见，没有得到结果。
    一九五一年一月，河南省人民法院调来此案，仍判梁永诗死刑，梁王氏十五年徒刑。梁王氏不服，上诉最高人民法院中南分院，诡称：“梁安氏不小心将小鸭踩死，我们只少骂几句，梁安氏心小生气，上吊寻死，有我村梁永兴、梁孔臣、梁永斌卸吊为证。屁股上的伤痕是卸吊时在锅边碰的，裤里的血是卸吊时顶破她的气丹（暗疾）啦。”并说在县里的口供是被逼出来的。
    一九五○年十二月一日，中南民主妇女联合会派人与最高人民法院中南分院商谈此案。中南分院于同月二十四日函河南省人民法院查办此案，至一九五一年二月二十三日收到此案案卷及梁永诗上诉状。中南分院受理此案后，因原案卷验断不明确，于六月二十四日将有关材料交由武汉市人民法院法医研究，认为需要蒸骨检验才能判明梁安氏死因。河南省人民法院也同意蒸骨检验。八月三十一日，中南分院派审判员三人会同有关部门人员至烧盆李庄实地调查，了解了真实情况。九月九、十两日当众开棺蒸骨验尸，验出安氏头部下第二四脊骨有浅淡色血痕，囟门骨暗色痕荫，方骨下四空均现青紫色，显系被勒未死、阴户受重伤而死。
    案情审明后，九月十四日在睢县召开了二万多人的公审大会进行四级公审。会上有烧盆李庄村干部、卸吊人等对梁安氏被杀作证，妇联干部及梁安氏母亲进行了控诉。群众情绪极为热烈紧张。凶犯梁王氏、梁永诗当场被执行枪决。
    此案判决后，群众莫不称快。他们说：“人民政府真是替人民办事。”“人民政府真是青天。”通过此一案件的审判，群众也认识到梁安氏之死，是死在不合理的封建婚姻制度之下，只有彻底实行婚姻法，妇女才能真正得到翻身解放。
