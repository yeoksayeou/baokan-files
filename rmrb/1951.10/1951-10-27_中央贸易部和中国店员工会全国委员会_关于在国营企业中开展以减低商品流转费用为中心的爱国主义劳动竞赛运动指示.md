Reducing commodity circulation costs is a necessary measure for state-owned trade enterprises to lower commodity costs, fulfill the tasks assigned by the state, expand capital accumulation, and strengthen business management. It is also an important method for implementing social savings and accumulating national wealth. Since the establishment of quota management for commodity circulation costs in state-owned trade enterprises last year, preliminary achievements have been made in saving expenses due to the efforts of trade administrative departments at all levels and all employees of state-owned trade enterprises. However, there are still many unreasonable situations that must be further improved. These unreasonable situations are mainly manifested in: First, losses caused by unreasonable planning, such as opposite or circuitous transportation of goods due to improper planning or allocation, resulting in increased freight, loading and unloading handling fees, transportation losses, and insurance costs. Second, unnecessary accumulation of goods and stagnation of funds due to lack of foresight in planning and operation, which increases storage fees, insurance fees, and interest expenses, and hinders the rational use of state funds. Third, excessive losses and liability losses caused by poor business management. Fourth, improper expenditure of business expenses and management fees, and some phenomena of extravagance and waste. In order to overcome these unreasonable phenomena, reduce commodity circulation costs, and strengthen the business management of state-owned trade, so that state-owned trade enterprises gradually embark on the track of economic accounting, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the National Trade Union of Shop Employees decided to launch a patriotic labor emulation campaign centered on reducing commodity circulation costs in national state-owned trade enterprises.

I. The general requirement of the patriotic labor emulation campaign centered on reducing commodity circulation costs is: leaders of state-owned trade enterprises at all levels and all employees should improve work methods, create typical experiences, and establish model banners in the emulation campaign, so as to improve state-owned trade work from the existing business management foundation, so as to reduce the existing level of commodity circulation expenses. Strive to save 400 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of this year compared with the established commodity circulation cost plan, and save 1.5 trillion yuan in 1952.

II. Trade departments of major administrative regions, commercial departments and bureaus of the five provinces and two cities in North China, and trade unions of shop employees should, in accordance with the spirit of this instruction, under the general requirement of reducing commodity circulation costs, formulate patriotic labor emulation campaign methods centered on reducing commodity circulation costs according to the different conditions of each region, each company, and each unit, issue joint instructions, and propose the main contents and requirements suitable for the region. Each professional general company shall issue instructions for reducing commodity circulation costs in accordance with this instruction, stipulating the overall goal to be achieved by the company in the whole quarter and the whole year, and the direction and goal of struggle for each regional company and each directly affiliated company. At present, state-owned trade wholesale organizations should take reducing commodity circulation costs as the central content of labor emulation, and retail organizations should take expanding sales volume as the center, and under this central requirement, reduce various expenses.

III. State-owned trade enterprise departments shall establish a patriotic labor emulation committee or other similar institutions, composed of enterprise leaders, trade union leaders, department in charge of commodity circulation costs, representatives of model workers, and representatives of technical workers with prestige among the masses. This committee is the leading institution responsible for formulating, implementing, and periodically checking and summarizing the plan for reducing commodity circulation costs of the enterprise unit (excluding affiliates) (State-owned retail enterprises may try to establish organizations similar to factory management committees). To carry out patriotic labor emulation, trade unions and administrations should carry out appropriate division of labor. The municipal commercial bureau, the provincial commercial department, and the trade department of the major administrative region should hold regular joint meetings with the trade union of shop employees in order to achieve uniform steps and discuss and decide issues that need to be resolved through consultation between the two parties.

IV. Before the launch of the emulation campaign, trade administrative departments at all levels and trade unions of shop employees should urge the leaders of their affiliated enterprises and trade union organizations to jointly conduct an inspection of commodity circulation costs, find out the waste phenomena in commodity circulation expenses in the past, and the reasons for these phenomena. After discussion and approval by the labor emulation committee, convene a staff meeting for summary, initially propose the enterprise's direction and goals of struggle, overcome ideological obstacles, conduct discussions and deliberations among all employees, and initially lay the foundation for carrying out the movement.

The labor emulation committee shall, before each quarter, on the basis of the existing cost plan and management methods, propose a specific plan for reducing commodity circulation costs as the basis for the struggle of all employees. This plan shall be summarized by the planning department and reported level by level to the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and trade administrative departments at all levels.

Trade enterprises at all levels must find out the regular figures (quotas) of various expenses from business activities through advanced experiences and actual results of expense expenditures in the emulation campaign as the basic basis for compiling the plan, in order to gradually lay the foundation for the cost quota work.

In the emulation campaign, it is necessary to establish the idea of firmly relying on the broad masses of employees, strengthen trade union work, extensively and deeply mobilize mass wisdom, carry out rationalization proposals, and frequently use business spare time to convene various specialized meetings to reduce costs, invite grassroots staff to participate, and absorb the opinions of employees on improving business management and reducing costs.

V. In order to guarantee the completion of the patriotic labor emulation campaign, collective contracts shall be signed between the trade union and the administration of each enterprise unit, and liaison contracts may be signed between various work departments. At the end of each quarter, the competition committee of each enterprise unit shall conduct inspection and summary, report to the trade administrative departments of each district, province, and city and the superior company, and summarize and report level by level to the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government. According to the results of the inspection and summary, convene a democratic appraisal and election model conference for all employees, and give spiritual and material rewards to the model workers in the movement. Each enterprise unit shall contribute 5% of the total employee salary as a reward fund (for those on the supply system, calculate based on all living expenses), which shall be controlled by the competition committee of each enterprise unit for timely rewards. The reward methods shall be formulated by the trade administrative departments and shop employee trade unions of major administrative regions and the five provinces and two cities in North China (the competition committee of each professional general company shall formulate it themselves) with reference to the trial implementation methods of the patriotic emulation reward for employees of the Northeast trade system. Trade administrative departments at all levels must widely introduce and promote the specific situation of savings and waste and the experience in the movement.

VI. Carrying out patriotic labor emulation campaigns must be combined with various policies, business operations, and employee welfare. Therefore, in the movement, we should prevent and correct the erroneous viewpoints and localism tendencies of detaching from policies and detaching from overall business management and only planning from the perspective of expenses, and we must pay attention to the labor protection of employees.

Trade administrative departments at all levels, state-owned trade enterprises, and local trade unions of shop employees should earnestly study and closely cooperate after receiving this instruction. Trade unions of shop employees at all levels should carry out work under the direct leadership of the local Federation of Trade Unions, and should promptly request instructions and reports to them regarding relevant plans and summaries.

    关于在国营企业中开展以减低商品流转费用为中心的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动指示
    减低商品流转费用，是国营贸易企业降低商品成本，完成国家所给予的任务，壮大资金积累，加强经营管理的一种必要措施，也是实行社会节约，积累国家财富的重要方法。国营贸易企业的商品流转费用定额管理工作，自去年开始建立以来，由于各级贸易行政部门及国营贸易企业全体职工的努力，在节省费用开支上，已获初步成绩，但还存在着许多不合理的情况，必须进一步的加以改进。这些不合理的情况主要表现在：第一，由于不按计划调拨或计划不当而造成的商品相向运输或迂回运输所引起的在运费、装卸搬运费，运输中的损耗与保险费加大的损失。第二，由于在计划上经营上缺乏预见性，商品供应不及时而造成不必要的商品积压和资金停滞，增大了保管费、保险费及利息的支出，并妨碍了国家资金的合理使用。第三，由于经营管理不善所造成的超额损耗与责任损失。第四，业务费及管理费上的开支不当与某些铺张浪费现象。为了克服这些不合理现象，减低商品流转费用，加强国营贸易的经营管理工作，使国营贸易企业逐渐走上经济核算制的轨道，中央人民政府贸易部与中国店员工会全国委员会决定在全国国营贸易企业中，开展以减低商品流转费用为中心的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。
    一、以减低商品流转费用为中心的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动的总要求是：各级国营贸易企业领导人及全体职工应在竞赛运动中改进工作方法，创造典型经验，树立模范旗帜，把国营贸易工作从现有的经营管理的基础上提高一步，以达到减低现有的商品流转费用开支水平。在全国范围内，为实现本年第四季度较既定的商品流转费用计划节省四千亿元，和一九五二年度节省一万五千亿元而奋斗。
    二、各大行政区贸易部、华北五省二市商业厅、局及店员工会应根据本指示的精神，在减低商品流转费用的总要求下，依照各地区、各公司、各单位的不同情况，分别制订以减低商品流转费用为中心的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动办法，发布联合指示，提出适合于本地区的主要内容和要求。各专业总公司应根据本指示发布减低商品流转费用的指示，规定本公司全季全年争取实现的总的目标，及各区公司各直属公司的奋斗方向与奋斗目标。在目前，国营贸易批发机构应以减低商品流转费为劳动竞赛的中心内容，零售机构应以扩大卖钱额为中心，并在这一中心要求下，减低各项费用开支。
    三、国营贸易企业部门，应成立爱国主义劳动竞赛委员会或其他类似机构，由企业领导人、工会负责人、商品流通费用专管部门、模范工作者代表，与在群众中有威信的技术职工代表组成之。这个委员会是制定本企业单位（不包括所属）减低商品流通费用计划，领导执行和定期检查总结的领导机构
    （国营零售企业可试办成立类似工厂管理委员会的组织）。开展爱国主义劳动竞赛，工会与行政应进行适当的分工，市商业局、省商业厅及大行政区贸易部应与店员工会举行定期的联席会议。以求齐一步调，并讨论决定须由双方会商解决的问题。
    四、在竞赛运动开展之前，各级贸易行政部门及店员工会，应督促所属企业负责人及工会组织共同作好一次商品流转费用的检查工作，找出以往在商品流转费用开支上的浪费现象，及造成这些现象的原因，经过劳动竞赛委员会讨论通过后，召开职工大会，进行总结，初步提出本企业的奋斗方向与奋斗目标，克服思想障碍，在全体职工中进行讨论酝酿，初步奠定开展运动的基础。
    劳动竞赛委员会，应于每季度前，在现有的费用计划及经营方法的基础上，提出减低商品流转费用的具体计划，作为全体职工奋斗的依据，此项计划应通过计划部门汇总逐级上报中央人民政府贸易部及各级贸易行政部门。
    各级贸易企业须通过竞赛运动中的先进经验和费用开支实绩，从业务活动中找出各项费用开支的规律数字（定额）作为编制计划的基本依据，以期逐步奠定费用定额工作的基础。
    在竞赛运动中必须树立坚决依靠职工群众的思想，加强工会工作，广泛深入地发动群众智慧，开展合理化建议，并经常利用业务空隙时间，随时召开减低费用的各种专门会议，邀请基层工作人员参加，吸取职工群众对改善经营管理、减低费用的意见。
    五、为了保证爱国主义劳动竞赛运动的完成，各企业单位的工会与行政之间，应订立集体合同，各工作部门之间，可订立联系合同。各企业单位应于每季终了时，由竞赛委员会进行检查及总结，报告各区省市贸易行政部门及上级公司，并逐级总结上报中央人民政府贸易部，根据检查总结的结果，召开全体职工的民主评奖选举模范大会，对运动中的模范工作者给予精神上、物质上的奖励。各企业单位应按月提出职工薪金总额的百分之五作为奖励基金（供给制者按全部生活费计算），由各企业单位竞赛委员会自行掌握，以便及时奖励。其奖励办法由各大行政区、华北五省二市贸易行政部门及店员工会（各专业总公司由本身竞赛委员会）参照东北贸易系统职工爱国主义竞赛奖励试行办法自行拟定之。各级贸易行政部门，须将节约与浪费的具体情况和运动中的经验，广泛地介绍和推广。
    六、开展爱国主义劳动竞赛运动必须与各种政策、业务经营及职工福利相结合。因此在运动中，应防止与纠正脱离政策、脱离全盘的经营管理工作只从费用上打算的错误观点和本位主义倾向，并须注意职工的劳动保护。
    各级贸易行政部门，国营贸易企业及各地店员工会应于接到本指示后，切实研究，密切配合。各级店员工会在地方总工会的直接领导下开展工作，有关计划、总结应及时向其请示报告。
