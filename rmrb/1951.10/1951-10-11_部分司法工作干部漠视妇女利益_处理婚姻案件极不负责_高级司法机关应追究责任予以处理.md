In the implementation of the Marriage Law, many judicial organs in various regions have adopted a serious and responsible attitude, handling cases promptly and conducting a serious struggle against violations of the Marriage Law. For example, after receiving a report that Meng Zhang of Hengcheng Village in Feixi County, Northern Anhui, had been forced to commit suicide, the People's Court of Feixi County immediately dispatched someone to investigate and handle the matter, relying on the masses to ascertain the facts of the case and punish the murderers (the light sentence given to the murderers was a shortcoming), reflecting the fine style of work that the people's judicial organs should have. However, there are still many judicial organs in various regions that have shown an intolerable bureaucratic style in handling marriage cases, and even committed illegal acts.

First, there are delays in resolving marriage cases. This is a fairly common phenomenon. For example, three cases of murdering women in the Shangqiu Special District of Henan Province have evidence and confessions, but have been delayed for two years without being processed. The case of Ren Ruilin, a civil affairs clerk in Yutian County, Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province, raping and killing Feng Xiuying has been delayed for more than a year, and the appeal to the second instance has been delayed for a long time without resolution. The divorce case of Ren Rutao in Wuyang County, Henan Province, was dragged on from 1948 to the end of May this year. This procrastination has led to serious consequences. For example, Zhang Yunge (female) in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, opposed her parents' arranged marriage and filed a lawsuit with the county people's court requesting the dissolution of the marriage contract. The court delayed the case for two months without a verdict. On the day before her wedding, Zhang Yunge went to the court to urge the case again, but still to no avail. Feeling she had no way out, she jumped into a well behind the court and committed suicide. A similar bad practice to procrastination is shirking responsibility. For example, a woman in Shetou District, Jintan County, Southern Jiangsu, went to the county people's court to request a divorce, but the court pushed the divorce petition to the district, and the district turned it over to the township, and neither of them processed it. Some women in Jiangyin area, Southern Jiangsu, are very dissatisfied with the procrastination of the judicial organs. They said: It is not easy to get a divorce now. It takes two months to go to the district and half a year to the court to resolve it.

Second, forced mediation of marital disputes. The People's Court of Shimen County, Hunan Province, actually said to a woman who asked for a divorce: "If you do not reconcile with your husband within a year, you will be sentenced to one year in prison." Huang Xiangfa's third wife in Nanning City, Guangxi Province, filed for divorce with the city people's court because she could not bear the abuse, but was "persuaded" to go back by the court, and as a result, the woman is still living a life of pain. The People's Court of a certain county in Guangxi Province handled a divorce case, and after three mediations failed, it still did not allow the divorce. In the end, the woman poisoned the man to death.

Third, the phenomenon of leniency in sentencing is also very serious. Wang Guozhen of Pillow Village, Seventh District, Linfen County, Shanxi Province, beat his daughter-in-law (who was pregnant) to death and angered his son to death, killing a total of three people, but was only sentenced to seven months in prison. Tulaifu in Aksu County, Xinjiang Province, killed his wife, Xia Ze's Khan, and was only sentenced to one year in prison. Peng Jinying, a woman in Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, filed for divorce because she could not bear her husband's abuse. Her husband, Zou Donghai, Women's Federation Chairman Jiang Tongsheng, and the masses Wu Jihong, etc., held a meeting to struggle against her and forced her to parade through the streets, forcing Peng Jinying to commit suicide by jumping into the water. Fortunately, she was rescued, and Zou Donghai took her back and hung her for four hours. The People's Court of Yujiang County only sentenced Zou Donghai and Wu Jihong to one month of labor each, and Jiang Tongsheng to seven days of confinement. In the case of Liu Yuqing, a production committee member of Rungou Village, Handan County, Hebei Province, who burned his wife to death with a hot iron, the county people's court sentenced the murderer to eight years in prison, and the second instance only changed the sentence to twelve years. More serious than the above situation is that some judicial organs condone criminals and do not punish them according to law at all. Jiyang County, Shandong Province, transferred Da Kuanzi, a criminal who poisoned his wife to death, to Linyi County, but Linyi County not only did not deal with it seriously, but released Da Kuanzi and sent him home. The People's Court of Yongshou County, Shaanxi Province, dealt with the case of Zhang Xiulan being raped by district cadres extremely carelessly, and did not punish the criminals who insulted women according to law. As a result, Xiulan jumped into a well and died after returning home.

Fourth, illegal judgment. The People's Court of Huanglong County, Shaanxi Province, believed that Ren Ruyi's behavior of fleeing back to her parents' home because she could not bear the pain of feudal marriage was "deserting her husband," and approved the divorce only after sentencing Ren Ruyi to two months of labor. The People's Court of Yangzhou City once mistakenly sentenced Huang Guiyin, a child bride, and Lu Chengyuan's behavior of walking out of a feudal family and marrying freely as "adultery and abduction." After being criticized by the newspaper, the court has reprocessed it. The Judicial Section of Changzhou City handled the divorce case between Zhuang Huanzhong and his pregnant wife, violating the provisions of the Marriage Law, holding five hearings, and "persuading and mobilizing" the woman, so that the woman reluctantly agreed to the divorce judgment.

In addition, the judicial organs in some places have also illegally formulated extremely unreasonable divorce conditions, deliberately making things difficult for women. For example, in some places, the divorce judgment stipulates that the woman pay the man a "remarriage fee," which is a complete violation of the Marriage Law. The "poor man" viewpoint of some judicial personnel in handling marriage cases also hinders the correct implementation of the Marriage Law. The above-mentioned erroneous thoughts and behaviors of some judicial cadres have aroused the close attention of the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice, and are being corrected by various methods.

### 部分司法工作干部漠视妇女利益  处理婚姻案件极不负责  高级司法机关应追究责任予以处理

    部分司法工作干部漠视妇女利益
    处理婚姻案件极不负责
    高级司法机关应追究责任予以处理
    在贯彻执行婚姻法中，各地有不少司法机关采取了认真负责的态度，及时处理案件，向违反婚姻法的现象进行了严肃的斗争。如皖北肥西县人民法院接到横城村孟张氏被逼自杀的报告之后，立即指派专人前往调查处理，依靠群众弄清案情，惩处了凶手（对凶手判刑仍轻是其缺点），体现了人民司法机关应有的优良作风。但是，各地仍有不少的司法机关，在处理婚姻案件中，表现了不能容忍的官僚主义作风，甚至发生违法行为。
    第一是对婚姻案件拖延不决。这是相当普遍的现象。如河南省商邱专区的三件杀害妇女案件，都有证据、口供，但竟拖延二年没有处理。河北省唐山专区玉田县民政科员任瑞林强奸并害死冯秀英一案，已经拖了一年多，上诉到二审，拖了很久还没有解决。河南省舞阳县对任如涛离婚案，从一九四八年直拖到今年五月底。这种拖拉作风招致了严重的后果。如陕西省醴泉县张云阁（女），反对父母包办婚姻，到县人民法院起诉要求解除婚约。法院将此案拖延了二个月没有判决。张云阁在结婚前一天，又到法院催案，还是没有结果，她觉得没有出路，便在法院后门跳井自杀。与拖拉作风近似的恶劣作风是推诿不管。如苏南金坛县社头区一个妇女到县人民法院请求离婚，法院将离婚呈文推到区，区又转到乡，结果都未处理。苏南江阴一带有些妇女对司法机关的拖延作风十分不满，她们说：现在离婚很不容易，到区里需要两个月，到法院需要半年才解决。
    第二是强制调解婚姻纠纷。湖南石门县人民法院竟对一个要求离婚的妇女说：“一年内不和丈夫和好，就要处一年徒刑。”广西省南宁市黄祥发的第三个老婆因不堪虐待，向市人民法院提出离婚，被法院“劝”回，结果女方至今仍过着痛苦的生活。广西某县人民法院处理一件离婚案件，三次调解无效，仍不许离婚，最后，女方将男方毒死。
    第三，重罪轻判的现象也很严重。山西省临汾县七区枕头村王国振打死了儿媳妇（怀着小孩），气死了儿子，共害了三条人命，却只被判了七个月的徒刑。新疆省阿克苏县土拉甫杀死了妻子夏则的汗，也只判了一年徒刑。江西余江县妇女彭金英因不堪丈夫虐待，提出离婚。她丈夫邹冬海、妇女会主席姜同生及群众吴继洪等开会斗争她，并强制她游街，逼得彭金英投水自杀，幸被人救活，邹冬海又把她带回去吊了四个钟头。余江县人民法院却只判邹冬海、吴继洪二人各一个月劳役，姜同生七天禁闭。河北省邯郸县润沟村生产委员柳玉清用烙铁烫死妻子一案，县人民法院判凶手徒刑八年，二审也只改判十二年。比上述情况更为严重的，是有些司法机关宽纵罪犯，根本不依法制裁。山东省济阳县将毒死妻子的罪犯大宽子转解临邑县后，临邑县不但不作严正处理，反将大宽子释放回家。陕西省永寿县人民法院处理区干部轮奸张秀兰一案极为草率，对侮辱妇女的罪犯不依法惩处，结果秀兰回家后跳井而死。
    第四，违法裁判。陕西省黄龙县人民法院认为任如意不堪封建婚姻痛苦躲回娘家的行为是“背夫逃跑”，在科处任如意劳役两月后始批准离婚。扬州市人民法院曾将童养媳黄桂寅与吕成元走出封建家庭、自由结婚的行为错误地判为“奸拐”，后经报纸批评，该院已作重新处理。常州市司法科处理庄焕忠与怀孕妻子离婚一案，违反婚姻法的规定，开庭五次，“说服动员”女方，使女方勉强同意判决离婚。
    此外，有此地方的司法机关还违法制定极不合理的离婚条件，对女方有意为难，例如有的地方，在离婚判决书中规定女方付与男方“续娶费”，这是完全违反婚姻法的行为。某些司法人员在处理婚姻案件中的“穷男子”观点等等，也妨碍了婚姻法的正确贯彻执行。上述部分司法工作干部的错误思想和行为，已引起最高人民法院与司法部的密切注意，正采用各种方法纠正中。
