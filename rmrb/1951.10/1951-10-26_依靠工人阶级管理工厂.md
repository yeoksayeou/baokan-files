Relying on the Working Class to Manage Factories
Sun Yi, Director of Dalian No. 18 Machinery Factory

Three years ago, the Party transferred me to work at the Dalian No. 18 Machinery Factory. I embraced the aspiration of running a good people's enterprise and happily took on the job. When I first arrived at the factory, I saw that it only had two and a half factory buildings and a little over a hundred employees. I thought: The factory is so small, the number of people is only "a company," it should be easy to manage, right?

When I came into contact with reality, I realized that managing a factory was not as simple as I had imagined. It was truly too difficult for someone like me, a complete layman, to manage a factory. I couldn't name the machines, didn't know the production process, and even asking questions to the workers would lead to jokes. After working for two or three months, I felt that although I was nominally the factory director, in reality, I was more like a visitor to the factory. I was very distressed and even thought about quitting. But when I thought about "a Communist Party member cannot bow down in the face of any difficulty" and the higher-ups often taught us to delve in and learn what we are not familiar with, I immediately cheered up again. After repeated ideological struggles, I made up my mind to honestly be a primary school student, rely on the working class, and run the people's factory well. In this way, I gradually figured out some "tricks," my work slowly improved, and I gained confidence.

In 1949, the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee called on everyone to intensify learning from the Soviet Union, invited Soviet experts to give us reports, and allowed us to participate in amateur technical schools taught by Soviet comrades. Sometimes, Soviet comrades also guided us in on-site operations. While learning from the worker masses in my own factory, I also learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In this way, I gradually learned the knowledge of factory management. At the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter of 1949, after repeated research, we conducted a bold attempt: abolishing the egalitarian time-based wage system and implementing a reasonable seven-grade piece-rate wage system. This improvement could not but urge us to improve other aspects of our work at the same time. Therefore, we also launched a new record-breaking movement to give play to the creativity and initiative of employees and increase production volume. But as production volume increased, a series of new problems also arose. First of all, employees expressed dissatisfaction with the frequent stoppages due to the untimely supply of materials. The workers also reflected that there were not enough tools, the machine efficiency was low, and no one was responsible for the work. The problems raised by the masses forced us to use our brains more and find solutions. Where do the solutions come from? Only by relying on the leadership of the Party, the organizational strength of the administration, trade union, and the Youth League, and the strength of the entire worker masses can we find solutions. So, in April 1950, we convened the first employee representative meeting. Before the meeting, we went deep into the worker masses to solicit their opinions. We were not afraid of the masses raising opinions to the leadership; we specifically invited comrades who had more opinions but were not elected as representatives to participate in the meeting. At the employee representative meeting, everyone actively expressed their opinions, fiercely debated, and repeatedly researched. Finally, everyone's opinions were consistent, believing that to solve the problems in production at that time, it was necessary to establish three responsibility systems: production, technology, and inspection. Clear provisions were made for the supply of materials, the use of machines and tools, and the responsibilities of relevant production personnel. Since then, the chaotic phenomenon of no one being responsible in production has been overcome, and I feel that the work is much easier than before. At this time, I deeply realized the importance of relying on the masses and deeply believed that the strength of the masses is infinite.

But new problems continue to emerge. After the new record-breaking movement and the establishment of a dedicated responsibility system, the worker masses broke through the old production quotas, so the problem of low production quotas was raised again. If it is not resolved in time, it will hinder the improvement of production. At this time, some comrades impatiently said: "How come there are so many problems! Is there really no end to it?" Yes! There is no end to the problems. We must move forward by constantly overcoming difficulties. We criticized these comrades' fear of difficulty, we reached a consensus, and then we began to solve this new problem. The quota problem is very complicated. We decided to consult Soviet comrades on the one hand, and collect and study the past materials of our factory on the other hand, make a preliminary plan, and mobilize all employees to discuss it. After top-down and bottom-up research, we set various quotas such as time, machine efficiency, tool and material consumption.

In the third quarter of 1950, our factory also implemented an independent accounting system and established a settlement relationship directly with the bank. We have made achievements in business management. In the past year, we have not taken out loans, and there has been no difficulty in insufficient funds for turnover. I felt very satisfied. However, there are still problems! At the Northeast Industrial Department's capital management meeting in August this year, I discovered that my factory's capital was stored in the bank without playing its role in reproduction. Therefore, I realized that increasing production, reducing costs, and accelerating capital turnover are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. In this way, I quickly accepted the turnover period of the three processes of reserve, production, and circulation stipulated by the higher authorities. This provides a lot of convenience for the current increase production and practice economy movement.

Over the past few years, in my studies, I have deeply felt that managing a factory is indeed not easy, and if you don't study honestly, you can't run the factory well. In the future, we will encounter more difficulties, but as long as we can learn humbly, we can firmly believe that we will definitely be able to run the people's factory well.

    依靠工人阶级管理工厂
    大连机械十八厂厂长  孙毅
    三年前，党调我到大连机械十八厂工作。我抱着办好人民企业的志愿，愉快地走上了工作岗位。我一走进工厂，看见工厂仅有两所半厂房和一百多个职工。就想：工厂这样小，人数才有“一个连”，还不容易管好吗？
    当我和实际一接触的时候，才知道：管理工厂决不是像自己所想的那样简单。像由我这样一个完全是门外汉的人来管理工厂，那真是太困难了。我叫不出机器的名字，不知道生产过程，连向工人提问题也都要闹出笑话来。工作了两三个月，我感到自己名义上虽然是个厂长，但在实际上好像还是一个到工厂里来参观的客人。我非常苦闷，甚至想不干这一行。但是当自己想到“共产党员不能在任何困难面前低头”和上级常常教导我们要钻进去，学会我们不熟习的东西的时候，我又马上振奋起来。经过了反复的思想斗争后，就下定了决心，老老实实地当一个小学生，依靠工人阶级，办好人民工厂。这样，我才逐渐地摸出了一些“门道”，工作才慢慢地有了起色，自己也增加了信心。
    一九四九年中共旅大市委员会号召大家加紧地向苏联学习，请苏联专家给我们做报告，让我们参加由苏联同志授课的业余技术学校。有时苏联同志还指导我们进行现场操作。我在向自己工厂的工人群众学习的同时，又学习苏联的先进经验，这样我就渐渐地学到了管理工厂的知识。在一九四九年的第三季末和第四季初，经过多次研究，我们进行了一次大胆的尝试：废除了平均主义的计时工资制，实行了合理的七级计件工资制。这一改进，不能不督促我们同时改进其他方面的工作。因此，我们又开展了创造新纪录运动，发挥职工的创造性和积极性，提高生产量。但随着生产量的增加，一连串的新问题也发生了。首先，职工们对于因供应材料不及时，而不断地发生停工待料的现象表示不满。工人们还反映：工具不够用，机器效率低，工作无人负责。群众提出的问题逼着我们多动脑筋，想办法。办法从那里来呢？只有依靠党的领导，行政、工会、青年团的组织力量，和全体工人群众的力量，才能找出办法来。所以我们在一九五○年四月召开了第一次职工代表会。会前，我们深入到工人群众中去，征求他们的意见。我们不害怕群众对领导提意见，我们特意邀请了意见较多的而未当选代表的同志来参加会议。在职工代表会上大家踊跃地发表意见，激烈地争论，反复地研究，最后大家意见一致了，认为要解决当时生产中的问题，必须建立生产、技术和检查三种责任制度。对于材料的供应，机器和工具的使用，以及有关生产人员的职责，都作了明确的规定。从此就克服了生产中无人负责的混乱现象，我感到工作比以前好做多了。这时，我才深刻地认识到依靠群众的重要，深深地相信群众的力量是无穷的。
    但是新的问题还不断地出现。经过了创造新纪录运动和建立专责制以后，工人群众突破了旧的生产定额，因之生产定额低的问题又被提出来了。如不及时解决，就会妨碍生产的提高。这时有的同志不耐烦地说：“问题怎么这么多！真个不得完吗？”是的！问题是没有完的。我们必须在不断地克服困难中前进。我们批判了这些同志害怕困难的思想，我们认识一致了，便着手来解决这个新问题。定额问题是很复杂的。我们决定一方面向苏联同志请教，一方面搜集和研究本厂过去的材料，做出初步方案，发动全体职工讨论。经过了自上而下和自下而上的研究，才订出时间、机器效能、工具和材料消耗等各项定额。
    在一九五○年的第三季度，我们工厂又实行了独立会计制度，直接和银行建立了结算关系。在经营管理上有了成绩，一年来我们没有贷过款，也没有资金不够周转的困难。我自己感到很满意。可是，仍旧有问题！在今年八月东北工业部召开资金管理会议时，我发现我厂资金存在银行里而没有发挥它再生产的作用。因此我才认识到增加生产、减低成本和加速资金周转是互相依赖和互相推进的。这样，我就很快地接受了上级规定的储备、生产和流通三过程的周转期。这对于目前正在开展的增产节约运动，给予了不少的便利。
    几年来，我在学习中，深深地感到管理工厂确实是不容易的，如果不老老实实地学习，是办不好工厂的。今后我们还会遇到更多的困难，但是，只要我们能虚心学习，就可以坚信：我们一定能办好人民的工厂。
