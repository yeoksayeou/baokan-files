    The People's Republic of China is a Mirror for Indonesia's Contribution to the Cause of World Peace
    Tabrani, Chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association
    The Indonesian nation is a renowned peace-loving nation. During the "Dutch Indies" era, it was even called "the most docile nation in the world." Therefore, when the Indonesian nation declared its Declaration of Independence, signed by Sukarno and Hatta, to the world on August 17, 1945, this declaration became the foundation for peace-loving rather than egoistic or war-mongering principles. The Indonesian people believe that there can be no peace for Indonesia while it is still under foreign rule. During the more than three hundred years of the Dutch era and the subsequent three years of Japanese rule, the Indonesian people never lived happily, let alone peacefully. Of course, during this period, the Indonesian people were like a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.
    Materially, the Indonesian people languished and starved in their own rich homeland; spiritually, the Indonesian people were suppressed, oppressed, and enslaved. All of this became the source of endless uprisings year after year, century after century. The Declaration of Independence on August 17, 1945, was not the beginning of the burning of the spark of the Indonesian national revolution, but rather the unified will of the Indonesian nation to jointly shatter the shackles of colonialism, thereby establishing a nation that is independent and autonomous both internally and externally.
    The birth of the Republic of Indonesia was not due to the Indonesian nation's hatred of other nations (such as the Dutch nation). On the contrary, what we hate is not the Dutch nation, but the Dutch imperialism and its aggression that attempted to re-rule Indonesia after the Second World War. Based on "equal footing," the Indonesian nation is prepared to faithfully live a peaceful and friendly life with other nations. In other words: as long as Indonesia's independence is not hindered, the Indonesian nation is peace-loving. Therefore, until the Dutch aggression (due to the assistance of Western imperialists such as the United States, Britain, France, and Belgium) has not been completely driven out of the Indonesian archipelago from Sabang to Merauke, there can be no peace in Indonesia.
    As everyone knows: the Netherlands is still occupying and ruling a part of Indonesian territory, which is the famous "West Irian." This fact forces the Indonesian nation to fight to the end against imperialism and Dutch aggression. Thus, it naturally hinders Indonesia's construction efforts, thereby making it impossible for the Indonesian people to obtain the fruits of their struggle—sufficient food, clothing, housing, and education—in the six years since independence.
    Currently, there seems to be peace in Indonesia, because the so-called Round Table Conference Agreement has been reached between the Netherlands and Indonesia. But in reality, unrest continues until the Netherlands and its companions have been completely driven out of West Irian. Therefore, for the sake of peace in Indonesia, for the sake of peace in the Pacific, for the sake of peace in all of Asia and the whole world, the sooner West Irian returns to the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, the more beneficial it will be to peace.
    The Indonesian nation has always been a peace-loving nation, as can be evidenced from its famous "Pancasila" state foundation. "Panca" means five, and "sila" means principles. The Republic of Indonesia, a unified nation, is based on the philosophy of five foundations or five principles, which are:
    (1) Divinity: Freedom of religious belief.
    (2) Social Justice: Striving for a just and appropriate life for the masses of the people, just like a socialist society.
    (3) Democracy: The people have democratic rights in politics, economy, and society. The people are the rightful rulers, and the government of the Republic of Indonesia is a government of and for the people.
    (4) The unity of the Indonesian nation is not based on narrow fascist or imperialist nationalism, but on broad, peace-loving nationalism.
    (5) Humanitarianism.
    Obviously, the Indonesian nation is inherently a peace-loving nation. Therefore, it has always been prepared to support any cause of peace that opposes aggression, opposes imperialism, and opposes capitalism. Due to the fact that Indonesia's situation is not exactly the same as that of the People's Republic of China, Indonesia's movement against American aggression and for the defense of world peace cannot be the same as that of the People's Republic of China. However, even so, it is clear that the Indonesian nation is a nation that loves peace and opposes aggression from any side. Therefore, fundamentally, the People's Republic of China and Indonesia have the same path and the same goal: which is to love peace and oppose aggression.
    While writing about Indonesia's contribution to the cause of world peace, I was honored to hear a detailed report from Mr. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression. This report was made at a meeting on October 3, 1951. Mr. Guo Moruo systematically and systematically explained the history, working methods, and achievements of the committee. I was delighted and encouraged by these many excellent gains. It is not an exaggeration to say that the People's Republic of China has been and is providing many examples and models on how a country or a nation should carry out its cause of peace against aggression. What I particularly value is the spiritual and material assistance given by the Chinese people to the Korean people in their struggle against American aggression. Only a great country and nation under the leadership of a great leader can do what the People's Republic of China has done for Korea.
    Obviously, the effect of this assistance has been fully demonstrated. According to the United States' estimate, it would be able to completely control Korea in a matter of days, or at the latest, weeks. But what is the reality now? The United States' aggression began on June 25, 1950, and now it is October 1951. Thus, for more than a year, the United States, carrying the flag of the United Nations and assisted by other countries, has still not achieved its goal. On the contrary, it has not only been driven out of the North Korean region and returned to the 38th parallel, but the current situation shows no sign of progress, and it is even retreating steadily.
    This is inevitable. Due to the Chinese people's voluntary assistance to Korea, resisting the American aggression against Korea has not only caused the United States losses in life and material, but also losses in its reputation, prestige, and authority in the world. This is the heavy blow that the People's Republic of China's voluntary assistance to Korea has given to the United States! Therefore, the United States' position has naturally declined, while the position of the People's Republic of China has risen even higher. But the rise of the People's Republic of China's position is not entirely for its own benefit, but for the benefit of all of Asia and the world that love peace and oppose aggression. Therefore, the People's Republic of China is a model for the nations of Asia in defending world peace and opposing aggression.
    Since Indonesia belongs to the nations of Asia, I pray that the relationship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia will always be friendly and become increasingly consolidated.

### 中华人民共和国是印尼在对于世界和平事业的贡献中的一面镜子

    中华人民共和国是印尼在对于世界和平事业的贡献中的一面镜子
    印尼中国友好协会主席  塔勃兰尼
    印尼民族是著名的爱好和平的民族。在“荷印”时代，她甚至被称为“世界上最驯服之民族”。因此，当一九四五年八月十七日印尼民族向全世界宣布了由苏加诺和哈达签署的独立宣言时，这个宣言就成为爱好和平而不是利己主义或嗜战的基础。印尼人民相信：当印尼还在外国统治之下，印尼就不可能有和平。三百多年的荷兰时代以及后来三年多的日本统治时期，印尼人民便从来没有愉快地生活过，更谈不上和平的生活。当然，这个时期的印尼人民正如一座随时可能爆发的火山。
    在物质上，印尼人民在自己的富饶的祖国土地上憔悴饥饿；在精神上，印尼人民被抑制、被压迫和被奴役。这一切，成为一年又一年、一世纪又一世纪、永远无穷无尽的暴动根源。一九四五年八月十七日的独立宣言不是印尼民族革命火花的开始燃烧，而是印尼民族的意志一致、共同粉碎了殖民地的枷锁从而建立了对内对外独立自主的民族。
    印尼共和国的诞生于世，并非由于印尼民族憎恶其他民族（如荷兰民族）。相反地，我们所憎恶的不是荷兰民族，而是在第二次世界大战后企图重新统治印尼的荷兰帝国主义及其侵略。根据“平等的地位”，印尼民族准备忠实地与其他民族共过和平友好的生活。换句话说：只要印尼的独立不受到妨害，印尼民族是爱好和平的。因此，当荷兰的侵略（由于美国、英国、法国、比利时等西方帝国主义的援助）还没有完全被赶出从沙横到默拉格的印尼群岛前，在印尼便不可能有和平。
    正如大家所知道的：荷兰还在占领和统治着印尼的一部分领土，这就是著名的“西伊利安”。这种事实迫使印尼民族为反对帝国主义和荷兰的侵略而斗争到底。这样，它就自然要阻碍了印尼的建设事业，从而使印尼人民在独立后的六年来不可能获得斗争的果实——足够的粮食、衣服、房屋和教育等。
    目前在印尼像是有了和平，这是因为荷兰和印尼之间已经获得了所谓圆桌会议协定。但在实际上骚动依然继续，一直到荷兰及其同伴们已被全部赶出了西伊利安为止。因此，为了印尼的和平，为了太平洋的和平，为了全亚洲和全世界的和平，西伊利安愈早回到印尼共和国的领土上来是愈对和平有利的。
    印尼民族从来就是爱好和平的民族，这可从她那著名的“五基”的建国基础上获得证明。五是五项，基是基础。印尼共和国这一个统一国家是根据五项基础或五项原则的哲学，这就是：
    （一）天道：宗教信仰自由。
    （二）社会公道：争取人民群众的公正的和适当的生活，正如社会主义社会。
    （三）民权：人民在政治上经济上和社会上有民主权利。人民是有权利的统治者，而印尼共和国政府是人民的和服务于人民的政府。
    （四）印尼民族的统一，并非基于狭隘的法西斯的或帝国主义的民族主义，而是广泛的爱好和平的民族主义。
    （五）人道。
    显然，印尼民族本是爱好和平的民族。因此，她一直准备着支持任何反对侵略、反对帝国主义和反对资本主义的和平事业。由于印尼的情况和中华人民共和国不完全相同，因此印尼的反对美国侵略保卫世界和平运动便不可能如中华人民共和国一样。但是，虽然如此，很显然地印尼民族是爱好和平并反对任何方面的侵略的民族。因此，基本上中华人民共和国和印尼有着同一的道路和同一的目的：这就是爱好和平和反对侵略。
    由于写关于印尼对世界和平事业的贡献，我感到荣幸地听到了中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若先生的详细报告。这个报告是在一九五一年十月三日的一个会议上作的。郭沫若先生有条理地和有系统地说明了该委员会的历史、工作方法及其成就。对于这许多优良的收获，我感到欢欣鼓舞。如果我说：中华人民共和国在对于一个国家或一个民族应该如何进行其反对侵略的和平事业上已经而且正在提供许多例证和榜样，这不是过分的。真正使我特别重视的是中国人民对于朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略的斗争中所给予的精神上和物质上的援助，唯有在伟大的领袖领导下的伟大的国家和民族，才能够有如中华人民共和国对于朝鲜所作的一样。
    显然，这种援助的效果已经充分地表现了出来。根据美国的估计，在数天或是最迟在数周内，它就可以完全控制朝鲜。但目前的事实是怎样呢？美国的侵略是在一九五○年六月二十五日开始的，而现在已是一九五一年的十月，这样，在一年多的时间中，擎着联合国旗帜的及由其他国家协助下的美国依然没有达到它的目的。相反，它不但已被赶出了北朝鲜地区和回到了三八线，而且目前的情况并无进展的象征，甚至正在节节败退。
    这是必然的。由于中国人民的志愿援助朝鲜，击退了美国对朝鲜的侵略，不但造成美国在生命上及物质上的损失，而且也造成它在世界上的名誉、声望和威信的损失。这就是中华人民共和国志愿援助朝鲜所给予美国的沉重的打击！因此，美国的地位自然下降，而中华人民共和国的地位则愈加上升。但是中华人民共和国的地位的上升，并不是完全为了她自己的利益，而是为了爱好和平及反对侵略的全亚洲和全世界的利益。因此，中华人民共和国是亚洲各民族保卫世界和平及反对侵略的榜样。
    由于印尼是属于亚洲的民族，因此我祈祷着中华人民共和国与印尼共和国之间的关系能够始终友好，并且日益巩固。一九五一年十月三日    北京
