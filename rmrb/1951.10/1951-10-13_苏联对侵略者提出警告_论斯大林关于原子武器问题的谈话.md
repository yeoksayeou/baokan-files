    The Soviet Union Issues a Warning to Aggressors
    --On Stalin's Conversation Regarding the Atomic Weapons Issue
    Lou Bangyan, Professor, Peking University

    The Soviet Union recently tested a type of atomic bomb, and in the future, it will conduct tests on various atomic bombs of different diameters according to the plan to defend the country against attacks by the Anglo-American aggressive bloc. In his conversation regarding the atomic weapons issue, Stalin answered the clamor raised by the bourgeois press due to the Soviet atomic bomb test so directly and straightforwardly.

    Stalin's conversation, published in *Pravda*, is a stern warning issued by the Soviet Union to the Anglo-American aggressive bloc. It has been widely supported by peace-loving people all over the world. At a time when U.S. imperialism is frantically invading Asia, actively arming Germany and Japan, and preparing for war with a massive military budget sixty times greater than that of the pre-war year of 1939, Stalin's conversation, like a bolt from the blue, is like a deadly "atomic bomb" dropped on unscrupulous warmongers.

    Panic? The various figures in the United States are indeed clamoring due to the atomic bomb test in the Soviet Union, which is clearly a case of "a guilty conscience is always uneasy." Because the Soviet Union has never wanted to, and will never, attack the United States or any other country, the reason for the panic is precisely the complete bankruptcy of the war merchants' consistent policy of intimidation and blackmail.

    Distress? It is again those figures in the United States who have always妄妄想to monopolize the production of atomic bombs that are indeed frowning due to the atomic bomb test in the Soviet Union, feeling that they can no longer intimidate people from now on. The theory of monopoly has no basis at all, because science cannot be blocked, and atomic energy cannot be kept secret. The reason for the distress is precisely the shattering of the illusion of ambitious people.

    From the beginning, the atomic bomb was used by the U.S. ruling class as capital for conspiring to monopolize the fruits of victory in the war. In 1945, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, inhumanely killing many Japanese peaceful residents in order to steal the fruits of victory in the war against Japan. The sacrifice of the peaceful residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was absolutely unnecessary, it was an extremely cruel act, a shameless gangster tactic, and an unforgivable sin. But the United States actually did this, and has always believed that it could monopolize the production of atomic bombs, firmly disbelieving that the Soviet Union had the conditions and possibility to manufacture atomic weapons before 1952. Thus, Truman threatened the world with the use of atomic bombs more than once. Truman also mentioned atomic bombs to scare us in the issue of the Korean War. We were not intimidated, but instead, it caused widespread confusion and panic within the imperialist bloc. As early as 1946, Stalin had already affirmed that the atomic bomb could only be used to intimidate a group of people suffering from neurasthenia, "but it cannot determine the fate of the war. Because to solve the fate of the war, the atomic bomb is completely insufficient."

    To block science and keep atomic energy secret was originally a fool's dream. In October 1946, Stalin frankly admitted to an American journalist that the Soviet Union did not yet possess its own atomic bomb or any weapons similar to atomic bombs at that time. However, in less than a year, the Soviet Union discovered the secret of atomic weapons in 1947. At the 30th anniversary celebration of the October Revolution in Moscow that year, Molotov said that the expansionists in the United States, "since they have lost confidence in their internal strength, they have placed their faith in the secret of the atomic bomb, although this secret has long ceased to be a secret." The arrogant American figures did not think this was possible at all, and thus said that this was the Soviet Union bluffing. It was not until September 23, 1949, that Truman and his ilk seemed to wake up from a dream, exclaiming in surprise and panic: "The fact of the atomic bomb explosion has already occurred in the Soviet Union!" The next day, TASS was ordered to declare that, in addition to pointing out the fact that the Soviet Union had already discovered the secret of atomic weapons in 1947, it calmly and solemnly stated: "As is well known, large-scale construction work is underway in the Soviet Union, which is the construction of hydroelectric power stations, mines, canals, and highways. This construction work requires the extensive use of the most modern technical means for explosions. Since these explosions have occurred and are occurring quite frequently in various regions of the country, this may attract attention from outside the Soviet Union." Atomic bombs can be used for mass murder, and they can also be used for further conquering nature. American monopoly capitalists are keenly interested in the former, because like manufacturing other munitions, manufacturing atomic weapons can bring them huge profits. For example, General Electric earned a net profit of more than $36.8 million in the first quarter of 1950 due to receiving a large number of government orders in the manufacture of atomic weapons. The socialist country of the Soviet Union, in addition to mastering atomic weapons for its use to prepare fully to deal with possible attacks by aggressors, also uses and promotes atomic energy for peaceful purposes, such as irrigating deserts, leveling mountains, reclaiming forests, developing industry... or even to a certain extent, as a bourgeois journalist said, "the Soviets intend to skip the era of steam and electricity and immediately surpass the West." The Soviet Union does not want war, nor does it want aggression, but based on the sinister international situation over the years, it cannot but have full preparations to deal with aggressors. The Soviet Union had to possess atomic weapons under the circumstances that its proposal to ban atomic weapons was repeatedly rejected. This is completely necessary and will definitely be effective; just as only after we supported the Korean people's resistance to U.S. imperialist aggression with the armed strength of the Chinese People's Volunteers, did the frenzied aggressors dare not rashly attempt to further invade our country.

    So, has the Soviet Union's opinion on the international control of atomic weapons changed? It should be affirmed that there has been no change at all. In this conversation on the atomic weapons issue, Stalin directly stated: "The Soviet Union advocates banning atomic weapons and stopping the production of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union advocates establishing international control so that the decision to ban atomic weapons, stop the production of atomic weapons, and completely use the atomic bombs that have been made for civilian purposes can be fully, strictly, and honestly implemented. The Soviet Union is advocating precisely this kind of international control." The manufacture and testing of atomic bombs are not contradictory to adhering to the position of unconditionally banning atomic weapons. "Only when those who advocate atomic bombs see that they are no longer monopolists will they agree to ban atomic weapons." Stalin said this, and the vast number of peace-loving people around the world believe that this is completely correct.

    Without a doubt, no one except war merchants would oppose banning atomic weapons and establishing international control of atomic energy. Even the Anglo-American aggressive bloc has put forward a so-called "international control" plan under the guise of double-dealing conspiracies. It is clear and natural that on the issue of international control, the positions of the two camps of war and peace are still divided.

    The U.S. plan based on the "Baruch Plan" can be said to be well known. Just as at the end of World War II, the United States unnecessarily dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in an attempt to monopolize the fruits of victory in the war, it also attempted to use the name of the so-called "control" plan to retain the possibility of using atomic energy for combat and to use this as the main means to seize world hegemony. The U.S. policy is nothing else, in a word, it is a policy of preparing for a new war. Expressed in the issue of international control of atomic energy, the United States hypocritically put forward a "international control" plan, the purpose of which is to arbitrarily dispose of, including exploring, mining, and using all atomic raw materials, through a so-called "international control" organization that the United States can actually manipulate the majority, but at the same time, the United States itself does not intend to put its atomic energy industry within the scope of international control. What does this mean? Anyone who is not an idiot will know that the United States is attempting to use international organizations to "control" the acquisition of atomic raw materials, the result of which is to make countries that have not yet mastered the production of atomic bombs never get atomic raw materials, as for the United States, it can continue and massively produce atomic bombs. What an arrogant wishful thinking of wanting to dominate the world!

    On the other hand, the Soviet Union's policy has been consistently firm. Whether it has not yet possessed atomic weapons or after it has possessed atomic weapons, the Soviet Union has always advocated: immediately and unconditionally banning atomic weapons, stopping the production of atomic weapons, establishing strict international control, and specializing atomic energy for peaceful purposes, in order to improve the welfare of all mankind and promote scientific culture. Two years ago, Vyshinsky firmly and solemnly expressed the Soviet Union's position at the United Nations General Assembly: "The prohibition of atomic weapons is an indivisible part of the peace program followed and maintained by the Soviet Union, an indivisible part of such a peace program that the Soviet government, regardless of which side dominates in the true comparison of forces, regardless of whether the Soviet Union knows the secret of atomic weapons or possesses atomic weapons, has maintained in the past and is still maintaining now." Precisely because the prohibition of atomic weapons is to maintain peace, the Soviet Union cannot but expose the double-dealing conspiracy of the arrogant U.S. ruling group, refuting their fraudulent trick of regarding the development and utilization of atomic energy as not a domestic issue of individual countries. For the socialist country of the Soviet Union, the tense international situation can force it to prepare a sufficient number of atomic bombs to deal with the ambitions of aggressors, and in addition, it must also massively use atomic energy to engage in peaceful construction in order to improve people's lives. That is to say, the Soviet Union cannot allow ambitious people to use the name of "control" to obstruct any sovereign country's plan to use atomic energy to benefit mankind. International control is necessary, but it must be strict, truly for disarmament, defending peace, maintaining security, and promoting cooperation among the people of all countries.

    From the above divergences, it can be seen that the two completely different propositions and positions reflected in the issue of international control of atomic energy also reflect two completely opposed diplomatic policies. What the Soviet Union advocates is strict, genuine international control over atomic weapons, which is a necessary measure to maintain world peace. If this international control cannot be realized, peace still needs the people of the world to strive for with greater strength. Although the United States also talks about "control," Stalin pointed out that "this is not control, but a mockery of control, a deception of the peace aspirations of the people of all countries." Because it "does not start from banning atomic weapons, but wants to make this weapon legal and legitimate." Then, it is obvious that such "control" is purely for the purpose of realizing the dream of dominating the world, for war, not for peace. Since the vast number of peace-loving people all over the world demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and the cessation of atomic weapons production, they must know which side to stand on, support which diplomatic policy, and support which position on the issue of international control. Today there are only two camps in the world, and the specific manifestations on the issue of international control of atomic weapons are also the same. We, the people of the world who are unwilling to be enslaved by imperialism, have only one position, one policy, and one path, that is: the position of opposing imperialism, supporting the Soviet Union's peace policy, and the path of struggling for peace. Precisely for this reason, on the issue of international control of atomic weapons, we firmly support Stalin's clearly proposed proposition, namely: international control that "enables the decision to ban atomic weapons, stop the production of atomic weapons, and completely use the atomic bombs that have been made for civilian purposes to be fully, strictly, and honestly implemented."

    As early as September 17, 1946, when the Soviet Union had not yet mastered the secret of the atomic bomb, Stalin had said to a British journalist that in order to remedy the threat formed by monopolizing the secret of the atomic bomb, there were at least two ways: (1) the exclusive possession of the atomic bomb could never continue for a long time; (2) the use of atomic bombs must be banned in the future. Five years later, Stalin published another conversation on the atomic weapons issue, which is another serious warning to aggressors. Those who have been advocating atomic bombs should be able to see that at present, it is no longer a question of monopoly, but a question of accepting or not accepting what the Soviet Union advocates, that is, what the peace-loving people all over the world support, the establishment of strict international control, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the cessation of atomic weapons production.

    苏联对侵略者提出警告
    ——论斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话
    北京大学教授  楼邦彦
    苏联在不久之前试验了一种类型的原子弹，将来还要按照保卫国家以防御美英侵略集团进攻的计划，进行各种不同直径的原子弹的试验。斯大林于在关于原子武器问题的谈话中，就那样直接而干脆地回答了资产阶级报纸由于苏联原子弹的试验而引起的吵嚷。
    真理报所刊载的斯大林的谈话，是苏联对美英侵略集团提出的严正的警告。它已普遍受到了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈拥护。当着美帝国主义正在疯狂地侵略亚洲、积极地武装德国、日本，并以六十倍于战前一九三九年的庞大军事预算进行备战的时候，斯大林的谈话对肆无忌惮的黩武主义分子，犹如晴天霹雳，落下了一颗致命的“原子弹”。
    惊慌吗？美国形形色色的人物确实是由于原子弹在苏联的试验而叫嚣起来，这很清楚地是“贼胆心虚”。因为苏联从未想要，将来也绝不会进攻美国或其他任何国家，惊慌的来由恰恰是战争贩子一贯的恫吓和讹诈政策的彻底破产。
    苦恼吗？又是这班一直妄想原子弹生产为一个国家垄断的美国的人物，确实是由于原子弹在苏联的试验而愁眉苦脸起来，感到从此再不能吓唬人了。垄断之说，原来就没有任何的根据，因为科学是封锁不了的，原子能也同样不可能秘藏，苦恼的来由恰恰是野心家的幻想的破灭。
    从一开始，原子弹就被美国统治阶级用作阴谋独吞战争胜利果实的本钱。美国于一九四五年对广岛和长崎投掷两颗原子弹，惨无人道地杀伤了很多日本和平居民，以此来窃夺对日作战的胜利果实。广岛和长崎和平居民的牺牲是绝对没有必要的，那是一个极端残酷的行为、无耻的流氓作法、不可饶赦的罪孽。但是美国竟然这样做了，而且一直认为它可以垄断原子弹生产，坚决不信苏联在一九五二年以前有条件和可能制造原子武器，于是杜鲁门就不止一次以使用原子弹来威胁世界。杜鲁门在朝鲜战争的问题上亦曾提到原子弹来吓唬我们，我们倒并没有被吓倒，反而是在帝国主义集团内造成了普遍的混乱与惊慌。早在一九四六年，斯大林即已肯定地说过，原子弹只可以用来威吓一班神经衰弱的人，“可是它不能决定战争的命运。因为要解决战争命运，原子弹是完全不够的。”
    要封锁科学、要秘藏原子能，原是痴人的梦想。一九四六年十月，斯大林曾对美国记者坦率地承认当时苏联尚未拥有自己的原子弹或任何类似原子弹的武器，但是不到一年，苏联即在一九四七年就已寻找出了原子武器的秘密。在那年的莫斯科十月革命三十周年纪念会上，莫洛托夫曾经这样说过，美国的扩张分子“既然对他们内部自己的力量失去了信心，他们就把他们的信仰寄托于原子弹的秘密上，虽然这种秘密早已不成其为秘密了”。狂妄的美国的人物不以为这有丝毫可能，于是说什么这是苏联在虚张声势。一直到一九四九年九月二十三日，杜鲁门之流才好像从迷梦中醒来，惊讶而又恐慌地叫出：“原子弹爆炸的事实业已在苏联发生了！”次日，塔斯社奉令声明，除指出苏联在一九四七年就已寻找出原子武器秘密这一事实外，又冷静而严肃地声称：“如所周知，大规模的建设工作正在苏联进行中，这就是兴建水电站、矿山、运河与公路，这种建设工作使得必须大大使用最新式的技术手段进行爆炸。既然这些爆炸曾经和正在颇为频繁地在国内各个地区发生，因此这就有可能会引起苏联国外注意。”原子弹可以为大量杀人而使用，也可以为更进一步征服自然而使用。美国垄断资本家对于前者发生浓厚的兴趣，因为像制造别种军火一样，制造原子武器可以为他们带来巨额利润。例如奇异电气公司由于在制造原子武器方面接到政府大批定货，在一九五○年第一季赚得纯利润超过三千六百八十万美元。社会主义国家的苏联，则除开掌握原子武器供其使用，以作充分准备来对付侵略者的可能进攻外，又利用并促进原子能于和平的用途，如灌溉沙漠、铲平山岳、开垦森林、发展工业……或竟至在一定程度上，像有一位资产阶级新闻记者所说的，“苏联人打算跨过蒸汽和电力时代，而立即超过西方”。苏联不要战争，也不想侵略，但是基于多年来的险恶的国际局势，它不能不有充分的准备来对付侵略者。苏联是在主张禁止原子武器一再被拒绝的情况下，而不得不备有原子武器的。这样做是完全必要的，而且一定会有效果的；犹如只有在我们以中国人民志愿军的武装实力来支援朝鲜人民对美帝国主义侵略的抵抗后，疯狂的侵略者才不敢轻举妄动作进一步侵略我国的尝试。
    那么，苏联对于国际管制原子武器的意见是不是有了改变呢？应该肯定地回答：丝毫没有改变。就在这一次关于原子武器问题的谈话中，斯大林就直截了当地说：“苏联主张禁止原子武器和停止原子武器的生产。苏联主张建立国际管制，使禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、并把已经制成的原子弹完全用于民用方面的决定得到充分严格和诚实的执行。苏联所主张的正是这种国际管制。”原子弹的制造和试验，与信守无条件禁止原子武器的立场是丝毫没有矛盾的。“只有鼓吹原子弹的人看到他们已不再是垄断者的时候，他们才可能同意禁止原子武器。”斯大林这样说，全世界爱好和平的广大人民都认为这话是完全正确的。
    毫无疑问，除开战争贩子以外，没有人会反对禁止原子武器和建立原子能国际管制。就是美英侵略集团也在两面派阴谋的作法下，提出了所谓“国际管制”的计划。很显然而且也很自然，在国际管制问题这一点上，战争与和平两个阵营的立场至今还是分歧的。
    以“巴鲁区计划”为基础的美国的打算，可以说是尽人皆知的。如像在第二次大战末期，美国对广岛和长崎不必要地投掷原子弹，企图独吞战争胜利果实，它又企图借所谓“管制”计划之名，保留利用原子能作战的可能性，并以此为主要手段来攫取世界霸权。美国的政策不是别的，一句话就是准备新战争的政策。表现在原子能国际管制问题上，美国虚伪地提出了“国际管制”的计划，其目的在通过美国实际上能操纵大多数的所谓“国际管制”机构，来任意处置，包括探测、开采和利用所有的原子原料，但同时美国本身却不打算把它的原子能工业放在国际管制范围以内。这意味着什么呢？只要不是白痴都会知道：美国是企图利用国际机构来“管制”原子原料的取得，其结果就是使尚未掌握原子弹生产的国家，永远得不到原子原料，至于美国则还可继续并大量进行原子弹生产。这是何等狂妄的想要独霸世界的如意算盘！
    另一方面，苏联的政策是一贯坚定的。不论在尚未握有原子武器时、或在已握有原子武器后，苏联始终这样主张：立刻和无条件地禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、建立严格的国际管制、使原子能专用于和平的目的，以谋全人类福利的提高和科学文化的促进。两年以前，维辛斯基曾在联合国大会上坚决而严正地表示了苏联的立场：“禁止原子武器是苏联所遵循和维护的和平方案的不可分的部分，是苏联政府不管那一方面在力量的真正对比上占优势，不管苏联是否知道原子武器的秘密或拥有原子武器，而在过去维护过、现在仍在维护的这样一个和平方案的不可分的部分。”正因为禁止原子武器是为了维护和平，苏联就不能不揭露狂妄的美国统治集团的两面派的阴谋，驳斥他们那种把原子能的开发和利用看作不是个别国家的国内问题的欺诈勾当。对于社会主义国家苏联，紧张的国际局势可以迫使它准备足够数量的原子弹来对付侵略者的野心，此外它还要大规模地利用原子能来从事和平的建设，以提高人民的生活。这就是说，苏联不能允许野心家借“管制”之名，来阻挠任何主权国家利用原子能以造福人类的计划。国际管制是必要的，但它必须是严格的、真正为裁减军备、保卫和平、维护安全、增进各国人民间合作的管制。
    从以上的分歧中可以看出，反映在原子能国际管制问题上的两种截然不同的主张和立场，于是也就反映了两种完全对立的外交政策。苏联所主张的是严格的、真正的对于原子武器方面的国际管制，它是维持世界和平的必要措施，如果这种国际管制不能得到实现，和平还需要全世界人民用更大的力量来争取。美国尽管也谈“管制”，斯大林指出“这不是管制，而是对管制的嘲笑，是对各国人民的和平愿望的欺骗。”因为它“不是从禁止原子武器出发，而是要使这种武器成为法定的、合法的。”那末，很明显，这样的“管制”是纯粹为了要实现统治世界的梦想，是为了战争，而不是为了和平。既然全世界爱好和平的广大人民都要求禁止原子武器和停止原子武器生产，他们就一定知道站在那一方面，拥护那一种外交政策，支持国际管制问题上的那一个立场。今天世界上就只有两个阵营，在原子武器的国际管制问题上的具体表现也是如此。我们不甘受帝国主义奴役的全世界人民只有一个立场、一种政策和一条道路，那就是：反对帝国主义的立场、拥护苏联的和平政策和为和平而奋斗的道路。正因这样，我们在原子武器的国际管制问题上，坚决拥护斯大林所明白提出的主张，即：“使禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、并把已经制成的原子弹完全用于民用方面的决定得到充分严格和诚实的执行”的国际管制。
    早在一九四六年九月十七日苏联尚未掌握原子弹秘密时，斯大林即已对一位英国新闻记者说过，为要补救垄断原子弹秘密所形成的威胁，至少有两种办法：（一）独占地掌握原子弹是绝不能够长此继续下去的；（二）使用原子弹将来一定要加以禁止的。在五年后的今天，斯大林又发表了关于原子武器问题的谈话，这是又一次对侵略者所提出的严重警告。一向鼓吹原子弹的人应该能看到，目前已不再是什么垄断的问题了，而是接受还是不接受苏联所主张的，也就是全世界爱好和平人民所拥护的，建立严格的国际管制、禁止原子武器、停止原子武器生产的问题了。
