　　Factory Branch Should Promote Hao Jianxiu's Working Method
　　　　　　Bi Keri
    It is the responsibility of every factory Party branch and propagandist to promote Hao Jianxiu's working method. The Party branch of the Class A team in the weaving department of the state-owned Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory took the promotion of Hao Jianxiu's working method as its central task in August and September. Because the propaganda work was done well, it achieved great results.
    When the weaving department's Class A branch began to promote Hao Jianxiu's working method, it encountered some ideological obstacles. For example, workers in the bobbin, warping, and weft yarn workshops said, "Hao Jianxiu's working method is for the fine spinning workshop, we don't have white flowers here, why should we learn from her!" The heddle workers said, "The bobbin and weaving shops can learn, they use electricity, we thread by hand, it's just asking for trouble to learn that method." After discovering these ideological situations, the Party branch first pointed out to the workers that the spirit of Hao Jianxiu's working method is to rationally allocate and use labor to achieve the purpose of increasing production and saving. After such publicity, the incorrect ideas among the workers were overcome. Then, the branch decided to raise the promotion of Hao Jianxiu's working method to the height of patriotism, and combined it with the current political tasks of the Party and the people of the whole country, and organized propagandists to carry out political propaganda. According to the branch's regulations, propagandists Dong Xiuzhen and Ding Xiuying told the workers, "Our country is still in difficulty, and the American devils are still invading Korea and occupying Taiwan. The people of the whole country are carrying out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and donate airplanes and cannons. We are learning Hao Jianxiu's working method, increasing production and saving, which is the best way to resist US aggression and aid Korea." "The money our factory earns now is used for three purposes: the first part is used to build national defense, protect our motherland, and let us live a good life. Another part is used for national economic construction and workers' welfare, everyone has already seen the newly built workers' dormitories, ventilation equipment, hospitals, nurseries; and now they are building a large bathhouse, all of which is this money. The third part is given to us as wages. Our increased production is to strengthen national construction, and it is for our own good life." The weft yarn room workers all agreed. In the process of learning Hao Jianxiu's working method, when it was proposed to change the weft yarn box to a small cart, pushed by the shuttle changer (saving labor), some workers felt "tired", and propagandist Ding Xiuying said, "The soldiers in the front are fighting day and night, risking their lives, isn't it for the safety of the country and us? If we can't stand this little 'tiredness', how can we be worthy of the soldiers!" Guo Wanyu and Wang Xiumei, propagandists of the preparation department, used the group discussion meeting to carry out political propaganda for the promotion of Hao Jianxiu's working method. At that time, someone said, "We learn Hao Jianxiu's working method, improve the quality of warp yarn, and the workers in the weaving shop get more wages, the benefits are all for the weaving shop." Guo Wanyu and Wang Xiumei explained to him, "It is a small matter for the weaving shop to get a little more wages, but producing one less defective cloth adds tens of thousands of yuan to the country, and adds one more point of strength to resist US aggression and aid Korea, which can protect our country and benefit us all." The workers suddenly realized. The workers in the finishing room proposed: "Finding a small problem is like catching a small thief, finding a big problem is like catching a special agent." The workers in the weaving shop put forward the slogan of "Produce less defective cloth and donate more." Resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and making donations has formed a upsurge in the entire Class A weaving department, and the workers have realized that their own interests are consistent with the interests of the country, which guarantees the successful promotion of Hao Jianxiu's working method.
    On the basis of political propaganda, the Party's propagandists also paid attention to technical propaganda, because after the workers' political understanding of Hao Jianxiu's working method was improved, they were eager to improve technically. However, the weaving department did not have a complete set of methods, so the branch decided that Party members and propagandists should take the lead in studying technology and improving technology with everyone. Guo Wanyu, a propagandist of the preparation department, discovered in her work that Wang Guiying's knotting method was good; Hou Xiumei's method of inserting yarn and sweeping the car was good; Mou Shuxian paid attention to saving and wasting less; Liu Yunxiang did a good job in cleaning; she concentrated these good methods and publicized them. At the same time, the propagandists also criticized some conservative and backward working methods in the propaganda.
    In this way, Hao Jianxiu's working method was promoted in the Class A weaving department, and the work quickly showed results: defective cloth dropped from 9% to below 3%, and the weft yarn room workers increased from a maximum of 28 machines to 30 machines, and achieved the pulling of weft yarn tails, eliminated yarn bobbins, and saved two people's labor for pulling yarn bobbins, saving two pounds of yarn bobbin waste silk every day. The weaving shop workers have all learned the new working method of patrol route, and half of the car watching workers have already used the new working method. The finishing department has begun to rationally use labor and save thread for sewing cloth heads, etc.
    The factory's Party branch must attach importance to the promotion of advanced experience, and every Communist Party member in the factory should become an advanced producer.

    工厂支部应当宣传郝建秀工作方法
          毕可瑞
    推广郝建秀的工作方法，是每个工厂党的支部和宣传员的责任。国营青岛第八棉纺织厂织部甲班的党支部，八、九月份曾以推广郝建秀工作法为中心工作。因为宣传工作做得好，收到了很大效果。
    织部甲班支部在开始宣传推广郝建秀工作法时，就遇到了一些思想阻碍。例如，织筒、整经与纬纱等车间的工友说：“郝建秀工作法是细纱间的事，咱这里没有白花，学他干什么！”穿扣工友说：“织筒与织布场可以学，他们用电力，咱用手穿来穿去，学那个法子是自找麻烦。”党的支部发现这些思想情况后，首先向工人指出了郝建秀工作法的精神是合理地分配与使用劳动力，以达到增产节约的目的。经过这样的宣传，克服了工人中的不正确想法。接着，支部又决定把推广郝建秀工作法提高到爱国主义高度，与党和全国人民当前的政治任务结合起来，组织宣传员进行政治宣传。根据支部的规定，宣传员董秀珍、丁秀英就向工友这样宣传说：“咱们的国家还困难，美国鬼子还在侵略朝鲜，霸占台湾，全国人民正在进行抗美援朝捐献飞机大炮运动，咱们学习郝建秀工作法，增产节约，就是最好的抗美援朝。”“咱们的工厂现在赚的钱有三样用处：头一份是拿去建设国防，保护咱们的祖国，让咱们过好日子。再一份是用在国家的经济建设和工人福利事业上，大家都已经看到了新建的工人宿舍、通风设备、医院、托儿所；现在又在修建大澡塘子，都是这份钱。第三份作工资发给咱们了。咱们增加生产就是为了增强国家建设，就是为了咱们自己过好日子。”纬纱室工人听了都说对。在学习郝建秀工作法过程中，当提出将纬纱盒子改为小车，由换梭工自己推（节省人力）时，有的工人又觉得“累人”，宣传员丁秀英就说：“前方志愿军不分黑白天，拚死拚活，不就是为了国家的和咱的安全吗？咱这点‘累’都受不了，怎么对得起志愿军！”准备部宣传员郭万玉、王秀美运用小组检讨会来进行推广郝建秀工作法的政治宣传，当时有人说：“我们学习郝建秀工作法，提高了经纱质量，布场工人就多拿了工资，好处都是布场的。”郭万玉、王秀美就给他解释道：“布场多拿一点工资是小事，少出一匹坏布就给国家增加好几万元钱，给抗美援朝多增加一分力量，就可以保卫住咱们的国家，与咱们都有好处。”工人们恍然大悟。整理间工人提出：“检查出一个小毛病，就像捉了一个小偷，检查出一个大毛病，就像捉了一个特务。”布场工人提出“少出次布多捐献”的口号。抗美援朝增产捐献，在整个织部甲班已形成一个热潮，工人们都认识到本身的利益，与国家的利益是一致的，这就保证了郝建秀工作法的胜利推广。
    在政治宣传的基础上，党的宣传员又注意了技术上的宣传，因为工人们对郝建秀工作法的政治认识提高后，急于要求技术上的提高。但织部又无一套完整办法，支部便根据这种情况，又决定党员、宣传员带头和大家研究技术、提高技术。准备部宣传员郭万玉在工作中发现：王桂英打结的方法好；侯秀美插纱和扫车的办法好；牟淑仙注意节约，浪费少；刘云香清洁工作做得好；她就把这些好方法集中起来，进行宣传。同时，宣传员在宣传中又批判了一些保守落后的工作法。
    这样，郝建秀的工作法就在织部甲班推广开了，并且很快见到了工作的效果：次布由百分之九降到百分之三以下，纬纱室工人由最多换二十八台增到三十台，并作到了扯纬纱尾巴，消灭了纱把，节省了两个扯纱把的人工，每天可节约两磅纱把回丝。布场工人都学会了巡回路线的新工作法，并有一半看车的工人已经使用新的工作法。整理部已开始合理地使用劳动力，并节约了缝布头的线等。
    工厂党的支部必须重视推广先进经验，工厂的每一个共产党员都应当成为先进的生产者。
