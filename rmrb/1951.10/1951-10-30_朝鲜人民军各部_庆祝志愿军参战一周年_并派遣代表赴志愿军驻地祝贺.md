Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th. Korean People's Army units are warmly celebrating the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war. Leaders of various units reported at meetings on the great victories and many heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting alongside the Korean People's Army over the past year, and called on all commanders and fighters to learn from the Chinese People's Volunteers' high level of internationalism and their heroic, tenacious, and fearless fighting style. Many units of the Korean People's Army also held discussion meetings around the anniversary, at which commanders and fighters spoke about their thoughts on the first anniversary of the Volunteers' participation in the war.

Zhang Wenshun, a platoon leader of the People's Army who had persisted in fighting behind enemy lines last year, recalled: "During the New Year offensive, the Volunteer Army comrades fought to the 38th parallel. When we met, we embraced each other like relatives. When they saw that some of our comrades were not yet wearing cotton-padded clothes, they took off their own coats and put them on us, and many comrades were moved to tears. Then we fought together with the Volunteer Army, and our victories became greater day by day. We are completely confident in striving for a victorious end to the war!" Around the anniversary, Korean People's Army units also sent representatives and cultural troupes to the Volunteers' stationed areas to congratulate them.

    在去年曾坚持敌后斗争的人民军排长张文顺回忆说：“新年攻势时，志愿军同志打到了三八线。我们一见面就像亲人似地拥抱起来。他们看到我们有些同志还未穿棉衣，就把自己的大衣脱下来给我们披上，许多同志都被感动得流了泪。接着我们就和志愿军一起作战了，我们的胜利也一天比一天更大了，我们完全有信心争取战争的胜利结束！”朝鲜人民军各部队并在纪念日前后派遣代表和文工团分赴志愿军驻地去祝贺。
