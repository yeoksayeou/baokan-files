    Welcoming the First Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Participation in the War
    Zhejiang People Exceed Donation Plan
    North China People Have Paid More Than 340 Billion Yuan in Donations
    [This newspaper dispatch] The people of Zhejiang Province, with practical actions to welcome the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war, enthusiastically paid patriotic donations. As of October 22nd, they have paid 186.47 billion yuan, exceeding the province's donation plan of 112 airplanes, 8 artillery pieces, and 10 anti-aircraft guns (totaling 183.2 billion yuan). The Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch of Zhejiang Province called on all parts of the province to further promote the patriotic covenant movement in areas and units that have completed the donation plan, so that the patriotic covenant truly becomes the driving force for promoting increased production and thrift and other tasks; all areas, units, and individuals that have not yet completed the donation plan must strive to complete the plan quickly and learn from advanced areas, units, and individuals. The branch also suggested to patriotic compatriots across the country to complete the payment task ahead of schedule nationwide, to commemorate the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war with practical actions.
    [This newspaper dispatch] The patriotic donation movement of the people in North China has achieved great results. According to statistics, as of October 15th, donations for 344 airplanes (Hebei Province added 5 airplanes) and 5 artillery pieces have been pledged, and 348.01702 billion yuan has been paid, reaching 66.8% of the total pledged amount. Beijing has pledged 69 airplanes and paid 66.6796 billion yuan, accounting for 64.42% of the pledged amount. Tianjin has pledged 100 airplanes and paid 101.3 billion yuan, accounting for 67.5% of the pledged amount. Hebei Province has pledged 85 airplanes and paid 111.68102 billion yuan, accounting for 87.32% of its pledged amount. Shanxi Province has pledged 32 airplanes and 2 artillery pieces and paid 30.61364 billion yuan, accounting for 61.47% of its pledged amount. Chahar Province has pledged 16 airplanes and 3 artillery pieces and paid 11.72415 billion yuan, completing 43.91% of its pledged amount (Chahar Province needs to reduce the amount of payment due to disaster). Suiyuan Province has pledged 12 airplanes and paid 13.64661 billion yuan, completing 75.81% of the pledged amount. Pingyuan Province has pledged 30 airplanes, and because the autumn harvest is late, it has paid 12.372 billion yuan, accounting for 27.49% of the pledged amount.
    From the overall situation of the donation movement in North China, it has entered a climax of payment since the celebration of National Day. People from all walks of life in various places have made payments in a guided and planned manner. Hebei Province is striving to complete the entire plan by the end of November. Tianjin plans to complete 75% of the pledged task by October 25th "to commemorate the anniversary of Anti-American and Aid-Korea." Zhangjiakou City in Chahar Province is continuing to carry out publicity and mobilization in order to basically complete the donation task by the end of October. A total of 81 units in the city, including the Mining and Electrical Machinery Factory, the Water Company, the Post Office, and private fur, sewing, and blacksmith shops, completed their half-year donation plans before National Day. In Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, 45 of the 53 industries in the entire business community held a collective parade to pay patriotic donations on October 15th, and have gloriously completed the donation task ahead of schedule. The ore group of the Steel Plant in the city increased its production donation plan by 8.1 million yuan, and the entire group's payment has now reached 9.047 million yuan.
    From the above situation, most areas in North China can basically complete the payment task by the end of November. In conjunction with the donation movement, various places have begun to universally check and revise patriotic covenants, and require everyone to participate in the patriotic covenant movement, so that the patriotic covenant truly becomes the program of action for people from all walks of life.
