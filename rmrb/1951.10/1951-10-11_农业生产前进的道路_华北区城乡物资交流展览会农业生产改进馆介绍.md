The Road to Agricultural Production Advancement
    ——An Introduction to the Agricultural Production Improvement Hall of the North China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition
    Lin Wei

    The Agricultural Production Improvement Hall of the North China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition uses the advanced experiences in agricultural production from various parts of North China to point out the path to agricultural production advancement.

    At the entrance of the hall, many large charts illustrate the current state and benefits of "organizing" in various provinces of North China. Statistics from ten model villages in Shanxi Province that were organized in 1950 (where the number of people organized accounted for more than 95%) show that the average yield per mu has exceeded 56% of that before the Anti-Japanese War. Due to the expansion of cultivated land, the total agricultural output of the ten villages has exceeded 85% of that before the Anti-Japanese War. The number of livestock increased from 537 to 1,054, and 1,110 new houses were built. Charts and typical examples tell people that the reasons why organizing can increase production are: First, organizing can improve labor efficiency, with three workers doing the work of four, or two workers doing the work of three. This frees up a lot of labor for intensive cultivation and increased fertilization. Before joining the mutual aid group, Liu Jubao, a labor model in Lucheng County, Shanxi, applied 46 loads of manure per mu; after joining, he applied 96 loads per mu. Guo Yu'en in Pingshun County used nine workdays to manage one mu of land before joining the mutual aid group, but now it has increased to eighteen and a half workdays. Second, organizing can implement a scientific division of labor and concentrate the use of resources, making things possible that individual farmers could not do. Pei Xingchen in Ximatou Village, Daming County, Hebei Province, organized an 89-person well-drilling mutual aid society, raising 20,000 jin of millet to drill twelve wells and twelve cone wells. Jia Lanhu in Xingtang County organized a afforestation cooperative, afforesting 3,600 mu (planting 450,000 trees), eliminating the village's sandy wasteland. Farmers in Naobao Village, Liangcheng County, Suiyuan Province, organized under the leadership of Gao Haiqing, opening more than 70 li of canals, irrigating more than 40,000 mu of land, increasing yield per mu by 50%, and planting more than 90,000 trees. Third, after organizing, the research on production technology and the timely dissemination and promotion of new experiences and new technologies are strengthened. Many mutual aid and cooperative organizations led by labor models now have their own technology research groups, research offices, and small agricultural experiment farms. The small farm of Zhang Zhiquan's mutual aid group in Yushe County, Shanxi, has trialed sixteen kinds of superior grain varieties, twelve kinds of superior coarse grain varieties, and also experimented with various methods of adjusting and improving soil and fertilizer, and trialed new farm tools such as weeding hoes and chaff cutters. In the research office of Zhang Xishun's mutual aid group in Daming County, Hebei, groups are meticulously divided for pest control, seeds, fertilizers, and animal husbandry. The hens raised by the animal husbandry group can lay eggs in four months. In addition to trialing various superior varieties and researching seed selection and soaking techniques, the seed group is now also trialing the use of peanut rhizobium to coat seeds. From last year to this year, the fertilizer group has trialed chemical raw materials such as ammonium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and ferrous sulfate. Their small farm is currently experimenting with the different results of the same crops under different management and different fertilization methods.

    Looking at the statistics from various provinces and even the entire North China, "organizing" has become a mass movement. At present, the number of people "organized" in Suiyuan Province accounts for 10% of the total number of farmers, Shanxi Province accounts for 55%, Hebei Province accounts for 49%, Pingyuan Province accounts for 40%, and Chahar Province accounts for 33%. This year, Hebei Province has one million mutual aid groups, more than 8,500 technical research groups, promoted superior varieties on 14 million mu, has 3,000 new-style walking plows, 74,000 sprayers, and used 8 million jin of pesticides.

    The numbers on the pictures and tables tell the audience that after the combination of labor and military force during the Anti-Japanese War in the North China region (some people farmed, some people fought; or they farmed together and fought together), after the combination of production and logistics during the Liberation War (some people did logistics work, and some people farmed all the land at home, with unified work points), and after the large-scale agricultural production movement after 1949, mutual aid organizations have developed greatly. Currently, there are the following types of "organization": The first type is seasonal, temporary, small-scale mutual aid. Mutual aid during busy farming seasons (exchanging labor and livestock, etc.), disbanding during slack seasons; working together on big jobs, and dispersing for small jobs or sideline production, with no fixed system. The second type is long-term, fixed-type mutual aid groups. They have a production plan for the entire group; they have a work point recording and settlement system; they can be combined with sideline production and supply and marketing activities; they can allocate and use labor more rationally; they pay attention to the research and improvement of farming techniques. This type of mutual aid group accounts for an average of 14% of the total number of mutual aid groups in the five provinces of North China. In Shanxi Province, it accounts for 32%. It should still be vigorously developed at present. The third type is economically cooperative mutual aid groups. In addition to having the various advantages of the second type of mutual aid group, they also jointly purchase large livestock and new farm tools, jointly open canals, drill wells, reclaim wasteland, plant trees, and run small farms, pooling public funds or charity granaries for use as public property, for reinvestment in production or for preventing famine and preparing for disasters. The fourth type is the highest level of mutual aid and cooperation currently, namely agricultural production cooperatives. Each farmer puts land, labor, livestock, and farm tools into the cooperative, making them into shares, implementing unified management, and distributing harvests according to shares. This is collective management on the basis of private ownership. It makes the use of labor and animal power more reasonable, planting and cultivation more planned, overcomes many difficulties such as you first, I later, more land, less land, more or less labor and animal power, and even more or less labor used on the land, and rapidly increases the number of plowing and fertilizing. An agricultural production cooperative led by Geng Changsuo in Wugong Village, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, was automatically organized by farmers in 1944 to survive the famine. In the beginning, land and labor were divided half and half for grain, and sideline production such as spinning rope was distributed with 70% based on labor and 30% based on capital. After the famine passed, everyone felt that this method was very good, so it has been preserved ever since. Although the proportion of grain and dividends divided by land and labor has been slightly modified continuously, the fundamental nature and method have never changed. At present, the cooperative has used public accumulation funds to buy a number of mules and carts, and built a number of houses as public property. The products of the farmers in the cooperative are sold by the cooperative; the means of production and livelihood materials needed by the farmers are supplied by the cooperative. When grain and funds are needed, they can be borrowed from the cooperative. When there is a surplus, it can also be deposited in the cooperative. This is not only cooperation in production, but also cooperation in supply and marketing, and cooperation in credit.

    Land reform, coupled with "organizing," has improved farmers' labor efficiency, improved production techniques, and improved various production conditions. Agricultural productivity in North China is developing rapidly. A chart showing the highest record of output per unit area shows that the highest yield of one mu of wheat has reached 900 jin (Wang Xihe in Pingyuan Province); one mu of corn has reached 980 jin (Li Shunda in Shanxi); one mu of millet has reached 980 jin (Guo Yunxiang in Hebei); one mu of rice has reached 1,100 jin (Zou Yubin in Tianjin); one mu of sweet potatoes has reached 10,000 jin (Ma Guorong in Hebei); one mu of potatoes has reached 8,000 jin (Dang Xingxian in Suiyuan). The average yield of one mu of rice in the Xiaozhan rice-producing area of Tianjin was 350 jin before liberation, and has now increased to 650 jin. In Xigou Village, Pingshun, Shanxi, which has thick soil and thin land, under the leadership of Li Shunda, the yield per mu has increased by 63% compared with before the war, and the Li Shunda group has increased by 108%. The "White Stem Hen Beak" millet they trialed yielded three shi per mu. Coupled with sideline income, the whole village has now changed from "bran and vegetables for half a year" to "every household has surplus grain."

    The exit of the Agricultural Production Improvement Hall is the collectivization section. In addition to exhibiting agricultural machinery used by state-owned farms, it also exhibits the situation of collectivized and mechanized agricultural production in socialist Soviet Union and its highest record (unit: one mu): wheat 1,350 jin; millet 2,680 jin; corn 2,812 jin; rice 1,975 jin; cotton 1,800 jin. These numbers, like dazzling giant stars, hang high in the forefront of the road ahead, attracting the eyes of millions of viewers.

    农业生产前进的道路
    ——华北区城乡物资交流展览会农业生产改进馆介绍
    林韦
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会的农业生产改进馆，用华北各地农业生产上的先进经验，指出了农业生产前进的道路。
    在馆的入口处，许多大幅的图表，说明目前华北各省“组织起来”的状况与好处。山西省一九五○年十个组织起来的模范村（组织起来的人数占百分之九十五以上）统计，每一亩地的平均产量已超过抗日战争前百分之五十六。由于耕地面积扩大，十个村农业总产量已超过抗日战争前百分之八十五。牲口由五百三十七头增至一千零五十四头，新盖房屋一千一百一十间。图表和典型事迹告诉人们，组织起来能够增加生产的原因是：第一、组织起来能提高劳动效率，三工顶四工，或二工顶三工。这样就省出许多劳动力，用于精耕细作，增加肥料。山西潞城县劳动模范刘聚宝在未参加互助组前，每亩地上粪四十六担，参加互助组后，每亩上粪九十六担。平顺县郭玉恩在参加互助组前，经营一亩地用九个工，现在增至十八个半工。第二、组织起来能实行科学的分工，实行资力的集中使用，这就使单个农民所不能做的事变成可能。河北省大名县西马头村裴兴臣组织了八十九人的打井互助社，集资二万斤小米，打井十二眼，锥井十二眼。行唐县贾兰虎组织造林合作社，造林三千六百亩（植树四十五万株），消灭了全村的沙荒。绥远凉城县脑包村农民，在高海清领导下组织起来，开渠七十多里，浇地四万多亩，一亩增产百分之五十，又植树九万多株。第三、组织起来以后，加强了生产技术的研究与新经验新技术的及时传播、推广。很多劳动模范领导的互助合作组织，现在都有了自己的技术研究组、研究室、小型农业试验场。山西榆社县张志全互助组的小农场，试种了十六种优种谷，十二种优种杂粮，也试验各种调剂与改良土壤、改良肥料的办法，试用耘锄与铡刀机等新式农具。河北大名县张希顺互助组的研究室中，精细地分了治虫、种籽、肥料、畜牧等组。畜牧组养的母鸡，四个月即能下蛋。种籽组除试验各种优种，研究选种、浸种等技术外，现又试用花生根瘤菌拌种。去年到今年，该组肥料组试用了硫酸錏、硫酸钙、硫酸铁等化学原料。他们的小农场，现在正在试验同样作物不同管理、不同施肥的不同结果。
    从各省以至全华北的统计看，“组织起来”已经成了群众性的运动。目前绥远省“组织起来”的人数，占农民总数的百分之十，山西省占到百分之五十五，河北省占百分之四十九，平原省占百分之四十，察哈尔省占百分之三十三。河北省今年有互助组一百万组，技术研究组八千五百多组，推广优良品种一千四百万亩，新式步犁三千部，喷雾器七万四千架，用农药八百万斤。
    图画和表格上的数字告诉观众：华北地区经过抗日战争时期的劳力武力结合（一部分人种田，一部分人作战；或合伙耕作，合伙作战），经过解放战争时期的生产与战勤结合（一部分人做战勤工作，一部分人在家耕种所有土地，统一记工），又经过一九四九年以后的农业大生产运动，互助组织有极大的发展。目前“组织起来”的形式已有下列几种：第一种是季节性的临时小型互助。农忙时互助（人畜变工等），农闲时散伙；做大活时伙干，做小活或副业生产时分散干，没有什么固定的制度。第二种是长期的定型的互助组。有全组的生产计划；有记工、清工制度；能与副业生产及供销活动相结合，能比较合理地分配使用劳动力；注意耕作技术的研究改进。这种互助组，华北五省平均已占到总互助组数的百分之十四。山西省已占到百分之三十二。目前仍应大力发展。第三种是经济上合作的互助组。除具有第二种互助组的各种优点外，还合伙购买大牲口、新农具，合伙开渠、打井、开荒、造林、办小农场，凑积公积金或义仓，做为公有财产，供再生产投资或防荒备灾之用。第四种是目前最高级的一种互助合作形式，即农业生产合作社。各农户把土地、劳动力、牲口、农具都入到社里，作成股份，实行统一经营，按股分配收获物。这是私有制基础上的集体经营。它使劳动力畜力的使用更加合理，播种耕作更有计划，克服了你先我后，地多地少，劳畜力多少以至土地用工多少等许多困难，使耕锄遍数与施肥数量迅速增加。河北饶阳县五公村耿长锁领导的一个农业生产合作社，是一九四四年农民为度荒而自动组织起来的。开始是土地和劳动力对半分粮，副业生产如纺绳等，按劳七资三分红。灾年过后，大家觉得这办法很好，就一直保存下来了。土地和劳动力分粮分红的比例虽不断有微小的修改，但根本的性质做法始终未变。现该社已用公积金买得若干骡子、大车，盖了若干房屋，作为公有财产。社内农民的生产品，由社推销；农民所需的生产资料与生活资料，由社供应。需用粮款，可向社内借用。有余时也可存入社内。这不仅是生产的合作，也是供销的合作，信用的合作。
    土地改革加上“组织起来”，提高了农民的劳动效率，改进了生产技术，改善了各种生产条件，华北农业的生产力在迅速地发展着。有一张单位面积产量最高纪录的图表说明：一亩小麦的最高产量已经达到九百斤（平原省王希河）；一亩玉米达到九百八十斤（山西李顺达）；一亩谷子达到九百八十斤（河北郭云祥）；一亩水稻达到一千一百斤（天津邹玉彬）；一亩甘薯达到一万斤（河北马国荣）；一亩马铃薯达到八千斤（绥远党行先）。天津小站产稻区一亩水稻的平均产量，解放前为三百五十斤，现增至六百五十斤。石厚土薄的山西平顺西沟村，在李顺达领导下，每亩产量较战前提高百分之六十三，李顺达组提高百分之一百零八。他们试种的“白杆母鸡嘴”谷，一亩收到三石。加上副业收入，全村现已从“糠菜半年粮”变成了“家家有余粮”。
    农业生产改进馆的出口处，是集体化部。这里除展出国营农场所用农业机器外，还展出社会主义苏联的集体化机械化的农业生产情形及其最高纪录（单位：一亩）：小麦一千三百五十斤；谷子二千六百八十斤；玉米二千八百一十二斤；水稻一千九百七十五斤；棉花一千八百斤。这些数字，像光芒四射的巨星一样，高悬在前进道路的正前方，吸引着千万观众的眼睛。
