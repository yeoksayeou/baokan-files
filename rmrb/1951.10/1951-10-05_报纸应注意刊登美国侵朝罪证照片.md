    Newspapers Should Pay Attention to Publishing Photographic Evidence of American Aggression Against Korea

    Publishing photographs of the crimes of American imperialism's aggression against Korea and sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations in newspapers is an effective method of exposing the aggressive face of American imperialism and educating the masses to understand the American aggressors in essence.

    Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea last year, many newspapers above the provincial and municipal level across the country have published many photographs of American crimes of aggression against Korea, in conjunction with various forms of articles. In particular, since late August of this year, 35 newspapers have published photographic evidence of the American aggressors killing our platoon leader Yao Qingxiang and bombing the Kaesong neutral zone. Among them, ten newspapers compiled these photos into pictorials. For example, the "China Youth Daily" on September 11, under the general title of "Oppose the United States' Sabotage of Korean Armistice Negotiations," organized a pictorial and added such a powerful explanation: "With human and material evidence complete, the United States cannot escape responsibility for sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations!" This approach is worth promoting.

    However, some newspapers have not paid attention to this. They still do not know that photographs are ironclad witnesses and ironclad facts, and their educational effect is significant. Therefore, it is obviously wrong for these newspapers to neglect the use of this propaganda method. In the future, attention should be paid to using this effective propaganda method to strengthen the effect of propaganda.

    报纸应注意刊登美国侵朝罪证照片
    在报纸上刊登美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的罪行照片，是揭露美帝国主义的侵略面目，教育人民群众从本质上认识美国侵略者的有效方法之一。
    全国省、市以上的许多报纸，从去年美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以来，就曾配合各种形式的文章，刊登了很多美国侵朝罪行的照片。尤其是从今年八月下旬以来，更有三十五家报纸刊载了美国侵略者杀害我姚庆祥排长，轰炸开城中立区的罪证照片。其中并有十家报纸把这些照片组成画刊。如九月十一日的“中国青年报”，在“反对美国破坏朝鲜停战谈判”的总标题下，组织了画刊，并加上了这样有力的说明：“人证物证全在，美国难逃破坏朝鲜停战谈判的责任！”这种作法是值得推广的。
    但还有些报纸对此未加注意。他们还不知道：照片是铁的见证，铁的事实，教育作用是很大的。因此，这些报纸忽视运用这种宣传方式，显然是不对的。今后应注意利用这一有效的宣传方式，以加强宣传的效果。
