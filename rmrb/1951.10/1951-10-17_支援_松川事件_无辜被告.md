    Support the Innocent Defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident"

    The reactionary Japanese government will hold the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" at the Sendai High Court in Sendai City on the 23rd of this month. To support the innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident," the Japanese people have launched a million-signature campaign demanding their acquittal. The Chinese people fully sympathize with and support this just struggle of the Japanese people and the innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident."

    For two years, the twenty innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident," with the support of the Japanese people and peace-loving people of all countries, have waged a heroic and unyielding struggle against the US-Japanese reactionaries. Neither cruel torture, forced confessions, nor illegal long-term public trials can shake their firm confidence in victory. The illegal judgments imposed on them by the reactionary Japanese government, including the death penalty, can never intimidate or subdue them. From the letters repeatedly sent to this newspaper, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the National Committee of the China Railway Workers' Union by Saito Sen, Suzuki Shin, Nikaido Takeo, Kikuchi Takeshi, and others, we can fully see the heroic spirit of the Japanese working class, who are unyielding and awe-inspiring. Their heroic struggle and heroic actions have won the respect and admiration of honest people around the world.

    The atrocities of the US-Japanese reactionaries in persecuting the innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" are inseparable from the crimes of US imperialism in rearming Japan and enslaving the Japanese people through a separate treaty. After the signing of the US-Japan separate treaty, the atrocities of the US-Japanese reactionaries in persecuting the Japanese Communist Party and Japanese democratic and progressive forces became even more intensified: illegally arresting leaders of the Japanese Communist Party, suppressing Japanese strike movements, and the movement of the Japanese people against the separate treaty and for democratic independence. However, these atrocities of the US-Japanese reactionaries not only cannot weaken the strength of the Japanese people, but have instead made the broad masses of the Japanese people more aware of the fate of their country and have aroused a broader struggle against the separate treaty. The heroic examples of Saito Sen and others, the innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident," inspire the determination of the Japanese people to fight. With the support of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, the Japanese people's struggle for independence and autonomy will surely achieve final victory!

    支援“松川事件”无辜被告
    日本反动政府将于本月二十三日在仙台市仙台高等裁判所举行“松川事件”的第二审；为了支援“松川事件”的无辜被告，日本人民已展开了百万人签名要求无罪开释运动。中国人民完全同情并支持日本人民和“松川事件”无辜被告的这一正义斗争。
    两年来，“松川事件”的二十名无辜被告，在日本人民和各国爱好和平人民的支援下，对美日反动派进行了英勇不屈的斗争。无论残酷的拷问、逼供与非法的长期公审，都不能动摇他们的坚强的胜利信心；日本反动政府强加于他们身上的包括死刑在内的非法判决，决不能吓倒和屈服他们。我们从斋藤千、铃木信、二阶堂武夫、菊地武等屡次寄给本报和中华全国民主妇女联合会及中国铁路工会全国委员会的来信里，可以充分看出日本工人阶级威武不屈的英雄气概。他们的英勇斗争和英雄行为，已赢得了世界正直人士的崇敬与钦佩。
    美日反动派迫害“松川事件”无辜被告的暴行，是与美国帝国主义重新武装日本、借单独和约奴役日本人民的罪行是分不开的。在美国对日单独和约签订后，美日反动派对日本共产党和日本民主进步力量的迫害暴行更为变本加厉：非法逮捕日本共产党领袖，镇压日本罢工运动和日本人民反对单独和约、争取民主独立的运动。然而，美日反动派的这些暴行，不仅不能减弱日本人民的力量，反而使广大的日本人民更加认清了他们国家的命运，激起了更为广泛的反对单独和约的斗争。 “松川事件”的无辜被告斋藤千等的英雄榜样，激励着日本人民斗争的决心；在中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支援下，日本人民争取独立自主的斗争一定能取得最后的胜利！
