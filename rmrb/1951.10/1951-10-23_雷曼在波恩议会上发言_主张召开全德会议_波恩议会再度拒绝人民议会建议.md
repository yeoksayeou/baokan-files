Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 21st: According to TASS, the West German Bonn Federal Assembly held a meeting on October 17 to debate the renewed proposal from the German Democratic Republic's People's Chamber on October 10 regarding the convening of an all-German conference.

The meeting was held at the suggestion of the German Communist Party and Social Democratic Party members, with the agreement of the vast majority of parliamentarians, after Adenauer issued a statement on the 16th rejecting the People's Chamber's proposal again without discussion in the Federal Assembly. At the meeting, even some right-wing parliamentarians expressed that the People's Chamber's proposal should be accepted in some form.

German Communist Party Chairman Lehmann spoke in parliament, advocating acceptance of the People's Chamber's proposal to convene an all-German conference, and the selection of parliamentarians from each parliamentary group in the Federal Assembly to form a committee to serve as a delegation to discuss with representatives of the People's Chamber the issue of holding all-German free elections in order to unify Germany, and to seek a swift conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

In his speech, Lehmann emphasized that in order to maintain peace in Europe and the survival of the German nation, the German question must be resolved peacefully. He pointed out that the People's Chamber's proposal for an all-German conference had no attached conditions. However, Adenauer put forward fourteen proposals in an attempt to block the road to German reunification. This attempt was shattered by the attitude adopted by the People's Chamber, which has clearly stated that it finds most of the fourteen proposals for all-German elections acceptable, and is prepared to discuss other issues with representatives of the Federal Assembly.

Regarding the statement issued by the Adenauer government on September 27, which described the all-German elections as a matter for the occupying powers, Lehmann pointed out that neither the High Commissioners of the three Western powers nor the United Nations are the authorities that should decide whether all-German elections should be held or what kind of election law should be adopted. These issues are entirely matters for the German people, and all-German elections can only be held after an agreement has been reached between representatives of East and West Germany at an all-German conference. Lehmann also pointed out that Adenauer did not mention the People's Chamber's proposal to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany because he dared not tell the German people his anti-popular stance on this issue.

Communist parliamentarian Fischer, in his speech, suggested that the Federal Assembly instruct the Federal Government to cease secret negotiations with the High Commissioners of the Western powers stationed in Germany.

Parliamentarian Tichi favored East and West Germany freely reaching an agreement on the rules for all-German elections. Non-party parliamentarian Tadden also spoke in favor of convening an all-German conference.

Nevertheless, the Bonn parliament rejected the two proposals of the Communist Party, once again rejecting the People's Chamber's proposal to hold an all-German conference and the request to stop the Bonn government from conducting negotiations with the High Commissioners of the Western powers stationed in Germany regarding West Germany's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and passed Adenauer's statement.

### 雷曼在波恩议会上发言  主张召开全德会议  波恩议会再度拒绝人民议会建议

    雷曼在波恩议会上发言
    主张召开全德会议
    波恩议会再度拒绝人民议会建议
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德波恩联邦议会在十月十七日举行会议，就德意志民主共和国人民议会十月十日所提出的关于召开全德会议的再建议进行了辩论。
    这个会议是在阿登纳在十六日未经联邦议会讨论就发表了再次拒绝人民议会建议的声明之后，在德国共产党和社会民主党议员的提议之下，得到绝大多数的议员的同意而举行的。会上，甚至若干右翼议员也表示应以某种形式接受人民议会的建议。
    德国共产党主席雷曼在议会发言，主张接受人民议会所提出的关于召开全德会议的建议，并从联邦议会中选择各议会党团的议员组成委员会充任代表团，与人民议会的代表讨论举行全德自由选举以便统一德国的问题，和设法迅速缔结对德和约的问题。
    雷曼在发言中着重指出：为了保持欧洲的和平，为了保持德意志民族的生存，必须和平解决德国问题。他指出：人民议会关于举行全德会议的建议并无任何附带条件。但是，阿登纳提出了十四点建议，企图阻塞恢复德国统一的道路，可是，由于人民议会所采取的态度，这种企图被打破了，人民议会已明白地声明，它对于举行全德大选的十四点建议，认为大部分可以接受，同时并准备与联邦议会的代表讨论其他问题。
    对于阿登纳政府在九月二十七日所发表的声明中把全德选举说成是占领国的事一点，雷曼指出：不论是西方三国的高级专员还是联合国，都不是应该决定是否应举行全德选举或应采取何种选举法的问题的当局。这些问题完全是德国人民的事情，只有东德和西德的代表在全德会议上取得了协议之后，全德选举才能举行。雷曼同时指出，阿登纳未提到人民议会关于加速缔结对德和约的建议，是因为他不敢把他在这个问题上的反人民的立场告诉德国人民。
    共产党议员费施在发言中，建议联邦议会训令联邦政府停止与西方国家驻德高级专员进行秘密谈判。
    议员梯希赞成德国东部与西部就全德选举的规则自由地取得协议。无党无派议员塔登也发言赞成召开全德会议。
    但是，尽管如此，波恩议会还是否决了共产党的两个提案，再度拒绝了人民议会关于举行全德会议的建议和要求制止波恩政府与西方国家驻德高级专员进行关于使西德加入北大西洋公约的谈判的建议，而通过了阿登纳的声明。
