    Established Close and Inseparable Feelings with Miao Compatriots
    Oral Account by Yang Youcai, People's Liberation Army National Day Observance Delegate and Artillery Combat Hero
    Notes by Xing Hua
    In March 1949, our company was dispatched to Majiayi Village, Dengchuan County, Yunnan Province, to be stationed. This village is located at the foot of the mountains in the northwest corner of Dali Mountain. There were more than 100 households in the village, only six of which were Han Chinese, and the rest were Miao people. Upon entering Majiayi, it felt very desolate, and we couldn't see a single person. When we went to each house, we only saw some old men and old women. Not a single young person or child was to be seen.

    We knew that this must be because Kuomintang special agents had spread rumors here. The Miao people had never seen the People's Liberation Army and did not understand our army, so they had hidden themselves. We knew there was no need to rush this. Everyone believed that as long as there was one elderly person or child in the village, and they lived with the People's Liberation Army for a few days, they would automatically call back the people who had fled. Now there were still dozens of elderly people in the village, so it was even less of a problem.

    I (note: Yang Youcai was the company commander of the artillery company at the time) and the political instructor invited several elderly people and discussed with them, asking them to designate housing for us. The Miao people have this custom: outsiders cannot live in the main house. They designated some of the worse side rooms and houses that had been used to feed cattle and sheep for us to live in. We respected their customs and all lived in the designated houses. Every comrade in the company knew that this was in compliance with the ethnic policy, and no one complained.

    Getting the people who had fled to return was our main task at the time. The conclusion reached by me and the political instructor was to do our best to help those at home with their labor and to carry out propaganda work during the labor. This decision was conveyed to the entire company, and all the comrades immediately took action.

    The Sixth Squad was stationed at the home of an elderly woman, Grandma Yang, who was in her sixties. She would try to avoid us when she saw us, and the soldiers always wanted to talk to her, but she didn't say much. However, when the soldiers saw that Grandma Yang had no water, they would fetch water for her, and they would sweep the yard and the streets clean. Grandma Yang saw that these young men in military uniforms were so kind and always smiling. At first, she was a little surprised, but slowly she understood. One day, the soldiers asked where her family had gone, and she boldly said that she only had one son who had been conscripted into the Kuomintang bandit army two years ago. She had fourteen mu of land, but since her son had been taken away, she had only cultivated three mu, and eleven mu were lying barren. She was just an old woman, barely surviving, hungry one day and full the next, all alone.

    When the Sixth Squad heard this, they all felt sorry for Grandma Yang. At that time, the soldiers said, "Grandma, you don't have a son, but we are like your sons. We will cultivate the land for you."

    Grandma Yang was shocked. Since her son had been taken away, no one had said a comforting word to her. Now she saw a dozen or so Han Chinese men in military uniforms standing in front of her, saying that they were her sons and would cultivate the land for her. She couldn't believe it, and she shook her head.

    The next day, the Sixth Squad asked Grandma Yang to take them to the fields, and in a few days, they had cleared the eleven mu of land and planted crops.

    Grandma Yang was extremely happy. She knew that the People's Liberation Army led by Chairman Mao was the people's army and also the army of the Miao people. Never before had there been an army to protect the Miao people. The old woman was so happy that she started talking more, and she told the soldiers, "Comrades, you see that everyone in our village has run away? When those security regiments (local armed forces of the Kuomintang bandit army) were about to flee, they told us, 'When the Liberation Army comes, you Miao people will all be killed. The old will be buried alive, the young will be killed, and the women...' The villagers believed their rumors and fled to the mountains. I was also afraid that you would really bury me alive. Now I understand, I will go find people and tell them to all come back."

    Grandma Yang ran from house to house, finding the elderly people who had stayed in the village and telling them to tell everyone to come back. In fact, the people in the east and west villages had seen the People's Liberation Army in the past few days, and they were the same as what Grandma Yang had seen. One by one, they went to the mountains to call their relatives.

    The people who had hidden in the mountains all returned. They knew which families the People's Liberation Army had fetched water for and which families they had cultivated land for. Everyone knew about the matter of cultivating land for Grandma Yang. They had originally thought that with the arrival of the army, a new disaster had come to the Miao families, but they had not expected that happiness had arrived. After this false alarm, everyone felt boundless joy in their hearts.

    The Miao people love to sing and dance. When there are festivals or great happy events, they sing and dance together. If people from two villages have danced together, the relationship between the two villages will be particularly close. Our company decided to hold a joint army-civilian celebration, and the company's propaganda team prepared some dances and flower drum performances.

    When the joint army-civilian celebration was held, we invited a respected person from the village to be the chairman. This was originally a very ordinary thing, but in the eyes of the Miao compatriots, it was an earth-shattering and extraordinary event. After the meeting, the whole village surrounded the soldiers, happily talking about their feelings about the celebration and recalling their past painful lives.

    The Kuomintang reactionaries discriminated against ethnic minorities, driving the Miao compatriots to the mountains and not allowing them to come down. Sometimes they would go into the city to buy some cloth and salt, but their goods and money would often be robbed by bandits, and they might even be beaten to death. Some of them had not eaten salt for a long time, and some had never been to the city at all. They said, "You look up to us 'Miao people,' you call 'Miao people' to be the chairman. In the past, when we were with the Han people, the Miao people never had a say in anything. With the arrival of Chairman Mao's army, the Miao people finally have relatives!"

    From then on, the feelings between us and the Miao compatriots became even deeper.

    The matter of the Miao people being the chairman quickly spread to the surrounding villages and to the Upper Five Villages in the mountains. The Upper Five Villages sent representatives to our company, asking to have a celebration with us, wanting to see Chairman Mao's army that treated the Miao people like their own.

    The comrades of our company's propaganda team went and performed some dances and flower drum programs for them. The people of the Upper Five Villages were extremely happy. They were not only happy because the performances were good, but what excited them the most was that the "Big Army" (the people of Yunnan still call the People's Liberation Army that way) came as soon as they were invited. The "Big Army" really looked up to the "Miao people." The whole village was busy. They slaughtered sheep and cooked meals, insisting on keeping the comrades of the propaganda team for dinner. The comrades of the propaganda team declined the invitation and returned without eating. The people of the Upper Five Villages were very unhappy. According to their custom, if you invite someone to dinner and they don't eat, it is the most embarrassing thing. From then on, the village chief of the Upper Five Villages would blush whenever he saw us, and the people of the Upper Five Villages also said that the "Big Army" had made them lose face and were very unhappy. It was not until later that the matter spread to Majiayi that we learned that we had offended the Upper Five Villages. What to do? We decided to perform another play and publicize the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." The comrades of the propaganda team went again, and after the performance, they explained to them that this discipline was personally established by Chairman Mao, and no one could violate it, so we didn't eat your meal last time; eating it would be violating the discipline. This misunderstanding was resolved, and our spirit of strictly observing discipline moved them even more. But they always felt that they had to give something to repay the People's Liberation Army to be satisfied. After a few days, the Upper Five Villages sent ten sheep, saying, "This is not what you took, this is what we sent, Chairman Mao did not say that you can't give gifts." This was a difficult problem for me and the political instructor. We discussed it over and over again, scratching our heads, and asked the battalion headquarters for instructions. The battalion headquarters asked the higher authorities for instructions, all the way up to the political department of the army. The political department's instruction was: we must respect the customs of the fraternal nationalities, accept the gift; they live very hard, we should not make them suffer economic losses, investigate the market price of the sheep, and send the money back in the form of a gift. This was a good solution, and we did as we were told. We accepted the gift, and they could not refuse to accept the gift. Later, after they calculated, they always felt that something was wrong, but they couldn't think of a better solution. After a long time, they made another silk banner with the words "People's Savior" written on it and sent it to us, which we gladly accepted. The people of the Upper Five Villages were extremely happy, feeling that this was finally fulfilling their wish.

    The Miao compatriots love the People's Liberation Army. They know that the People's Liberation Army is so good because of Chairman Mao's good leadership. They love Chairman Mao and the People's Government. As soon as the task of the public grain in 1950 was issued, the Miao compatriots in the villages near our station automatically proposed: "We 'Miao families' love the motherland and want to pay all the public grain in one day." The people in the villages were very busy, rushing to send grain to the district. An old woman put a bag of grain on the road and sat on the ground crying. The soldier Ma Yingchun saw her and asked her why she was crying. She said, "Our whole village is willing to pay all the public grain in one day and be patriotic models. I can't make it to send it today, and I feel uncomfortable." I sent a soldier to help her send the grain, and she felt relieved.

    和苗族同胞建立了亲密无间的感情
    人民解放军国庆节观礼代表炮兵战斗英雄  杨有才口述
    星华笔记
    一九四九年三月，我们连被派遣到云南省邓川县马家邑村驻防。这个村庄在大理山西北角的山脚下。全村有一百多户人家，只有六家是汉族人，其余都是苗族人，一进马家邑，就感觉十分荒凉，看不见一个人，到各家去找，才看见一些老大爹和老大妈。年轻人和小孩子一个也不见。
    我们知道，这一定是国民党特务在这里散布下谣言，苗胞还没有见过人民解放军，对我军不了解，躲藏起来了。我们知道这不能着急，大家相信只要村里还有一个老年人或小孩子，他们和人民解放军在一块住几天，就会自动把逃出的人叫回来。现在这个村庄还有几十个老年人，这就更不成问题了。
    我（按：杨有才当时是该炮兵连连长）和指导员请来了几个老年人，和他们商量，请他们给我们指定住房。苗族同胞有这样的风俗，外人不能住正房。他们给我们指定的都是一些较坏的偏房和喂过牛羊的房子。我们尊重他们的风俗习惯，都在指定的房子住下了。全连每个同志都知道这是遵守民族政策，没有一句怨言。
    让逃出去的人回来，是我们当时的主要工作。我和指导员研究的结论是，尽我们的力量帮助在家的人劳动，在劳动中作宣传工作。这个决定传达到全连，全连同志就立刻行动起来了。
    六班住在一个六十多岁的杨大妈家。她看见我们就躲躲闪闪的，战士们老想找她谈话，她总不多说话。可是，战士们看见杨大妈没了水，就给她挑水，又把院里、街上扫得一干二净。杨大妈看见这些穿军装的年轻人，都是那么和善，总是笑嘻嘻的。最初她还有些奇怪，慢慢地她明白了。这一天，战士们问她家的人上那去了，她便大胆地说出自己只有一个儿子，两年前被国民党匪军抓去当兵，她有十四亩地，从儿子被抓走后，她只种了三亩，十一亩都荒着。就她这么一个老太婆饿一顿饱一顿孤苦伶仃地熬着。
    六班同志一听，个个都为杨大妈难过。当时战士们就说：“大妈，你没有儿子，我们就和你的儿子一样，我们给你种地。”
    杨大妈吃了一惊。自从她的儿子被抓走后，就没有一个人给她说过一句贴心话。现在她看见眼前站着十几个穿军装的汉族人，说是她的儿子，要给她种地，她不能相信，她摇摇头。
    第二天，六班让杨大妈带着他们下地，几天工夫就把十一亩地开垦完，种上了庄稼。
    杨大妈喜欢极了，她知道了毛主席领导的解放军是人民的军队，也是苗族人民的军队。多少年来，那有过军队保护苗族人的。老太婆心里一高兴，话也多了，她找着战士们说：“同志，你看我们村里人不都跑了吗？那些保安团（国民党匪军的地方武装）临逃跑的时候对我们说：‘解放军来了，你们这些苗子，都得叫杀光。老的活埋，小的杀死，女的……。’村里人听信了他们的谣言，都逃上山去了，我也害怕你们真要活埋我。现在我明白了，我去找人叫他们都回来。”
    杨大妈从东家跑到西家，找着留在村里的老年人，叫他们去叫人们都回来。其实东家西家这几天看见的人民解放军，和杨大妈看见的一样，他们都一个跟一个地到山上叫自己的亲人去了。
    躲到山上的人都回来了。他们知道人民解放军给谁家挑过水，给谁家种过地。给杨大妈种地这件事情人人都知道。他们原想，来了军队，苗家又来了新的大灾难，却没有想到是来了幸福。这一场虚惊过去以后，人们的心里都无限喜悦。
    苗族人民最喜欢唱歌跳舞，一到过节或有大喜事，他们就在一块又唱又跳。两个村庄的人如果在一块跳过舞，这两个村庄的交情就特别亲密。我们连就决定开个军民联欢会，让连里的宣传组准备了几个舞蹈和花鼓等小节目。
    开军民联欢会时，我们请村里有威望的人当主席。这本来是件很平常的事，但是在苗族同胞看起来，可是件翻天覆地的不平常的大事。开完会，全村的人都围着战士们，欢笑地谈论着他们对联欢会的感想，回忆起过去痛苦的生活。
    国民党反动派歧视少数民族，把苗族同胞赶到大山上，不准他们下山。有时他们进城买点布，买点盐，东西和钱时常被匪徒们一齐抢光，说不定还要把人打死。他们有些人已经很久没有吃过盐，有些人根本没有进过城。他们说：“你们看得起‘苗家人’，你们叫‘苗家人’当主席；过去和汉人在一块，干什么也没有苗家的份。毛主席的大军来了，苗家才有了亲人！”
    从这以后，我们和苗族同胞间的感情又深厚了一层。
    苗家人当主席的事，很快传到周围的村庄，传到山上的上五村。上五村派代表到我们连里来，要求和我们联欢，要想看看对待苗家像自己人一样的毛主席的军队。
    我们连的宣传组的同志去了，给他们表演了些舞蹈和花鼓等节目。上五村的人民高兴极了。他们不只因为表演的好看高兴，使他们最兴奋的是“大军”（云南人民到现在还这样称呼人民解放军）一请就来，“大军”真是看得起“苗家”。全村人都忙起来。杀羊，做饭，一定要留宣传组同志吃饭。宣传组的同志们谢绝了招待，没有吃饭就回来了。上五村的人很不高兴。照他们的风俗，请人家吃饭，人家不吃是最丢脸的事。从这以后上五村的村长一见我们就脸红，上五村的人也说“大军”让他们丢了脸，很不乐意。这件事直到以后传到马家邑，我们才知道得罪了上五村。怎么办呢？我们决定再去演一次戏，宣传一下“三大纪律八项注意”宣传组的同志又去了，演完戏，就给他们讲：这个纪律是毛主席亲手订的，谁也不能违犯，所以上回没吃你们的饭；吃了就是犯纪律。这个误会解除了，我们这种严守纪律的精神，更使他们感动。但是他们总觉得要拿点东西报答人民解放军才满意。过了几天，上五村便送来了十只羊，说：“这不是你们拿的，是我们送的，毛主席没有说不准送礼。”这可给我和指导员出了难题。我们两个再三商量，总是抓头皮，请示营部，营部又向上级请示，一直请示到军政治部，政治部的指示是：要尊重兄弟民族的风俗习惯，礼物收下；他们生活很苦，不应使他们经济上受损失，调查羊的市价，用送礼方式把钱送去。这是好办法，我们照办了。我们收了礼，他们也不能不收礼。以后他们一盘算，总觉得不对头，可是再想不出好办法。过了很久，他们又做了一面写着“人民救星”的锦旗送给我们，我们愉快地收下了。上五村的人民高兴极了，觉得这才算是了却了心愿。
    苗族同胞热爱人民解放军，他们知道人民解放军这样好，是毛主席领导的好。他们热爱毛主席，热爱人民政府。一九五○年的公粮任务一下来，我们驻地附近村庄的苗族同胞，便自动提出：“我们‘苗家’热爱祖国，要一天缴齐公粮。”村子里的人们都非常忙碌，争先往区上送粮食。有一个老大妈，把一口袋粮食放到路上，坐在地下哭起来。战士马迎春看见了，问她为什么哭，她说：“我们全村都愿意一天缴齐公粮，当爱国模范。我赶不上今天送到，心里难受。”我便派了一个战士帮她把粮食送去，她才放了心。
