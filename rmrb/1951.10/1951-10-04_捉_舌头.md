    Capturing a "Tongue"
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Fu DeGui
    I am a squad leader in a reconnaissance unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. On July 28th, our company received the mission of capturing a "tongue" (grabbing a prisoner to ascertain the enemy situation). On the night of the 29th, our unit braved the heavy rain and advanced to the vicinity of Tieyuan, ambushing alongside a highway. At that time, I was assigned to the machine gun team to provide cover.

    The next day, as soon as it dawned, the enemy indeed came. Above were planes, and below were cars and tanks. The enemy didn't go far before jumping out of the cars and opening fire on us. We hid in our fortifications and ignored them. Then, an enemy platoon charged towards us. After a short while, I peeked out and saw six devils had already climbed up, only five or six steps away from us. I thought they had come at the perfect time and immediately gave them a burst. Four of the little devils went to see the King of Hell on the spot. The other two were so anxious that they covered their heads and crawled back. My machine gun fired two "point bursts," and those two also stopped moving.

    The enemy was still not reconciled and used machine guns and artillery to cover more than forty people who came up. When they were about thirty meters away from us, my machine gun opened fire again, causing the enemy to howl like ghosts and wail like wolves as they fled in panic. This time, not many of them went back alive.

    At this time, an enemy heavy machine gun was firing quite intensely and aggressively. I took the opportunity to take a closer look and saw that it was not far from me, so I fired two bursts at it fiercely, and as a result, it became mute.

    But later I thought, "Damn, I've been fighting the enemy for most of the day, and I've killed quite a few, but I haven't captured a single living one." So I advanced towards the highway. As soon as I moved, I immediately heard someone muttering next to me. I looked and saw three enemies had already scurried into a trench. I rushed up and shouted, "You little bastards, you've come at the right time!" One of the little devils and I fired at the same time, but because he was already frightened, his shot missed and only put a hole in my clothes. My machine gun fired a point burst and knocked him down. The remaining two guys, one holding a duckbill grenade and the other holding a carbine, were about to fire. At this time, my bullets were already used up. In my anxiety, I came up with a clever idea and smashed the butt of my gun hard on the head of the little devil holding the grenade. As a result, this guy sat down on the ground, the grenade in his hand went off, and blew up his own ass. I turned around and swung, and I don't know where a burst of energy came from, but I smashed a walnut-sized hole in the other little devil's shoulder. Just then, there was an air-raid shelter next to him, and he desperately drilled into it, but the gun was exposed outside. I snatched it away and locked him in the air-raid shelter. Looking back, the guy without an ass was about to shoot me, so I used the gun I had just seized to end this little devil's life. Then I shouted loudly, "Platoon leader, platoon leader! Come quickly! The 'tongue' has been captured!" The platoon leader ran over laughing, "Hello! Hello!" he shouted several times before the devil hiding in the cave crawled out. In this way, we successfully completed the task of capturing the "tongue".

    捉“舌头”
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  傅德贵
    我是中国人民志愿军某侦察部队的一个班长。七月二十八日，我们连接受了捉“舌头”（抓俘虏以查明敌情）的任务。二十九日黑夜，我们部队冒着大雨进到铁原附近，埋伏在一条公路跟前。当时我被分配到机枪组负责打掩护。
    第二天天一亮，敌人果然来了。上面是飞机，下面是汽车和坦克。敌人走了没多远便跳下汽车来向我们开了家伙。我们躲在工事里没有理他。接着，敌人一个排就向我们这边冲来。不多一会，我伸头一看，六个鬼子已经爬了上来，离我们只有五、六步了，我想来得正好，立刻就给他们“哗啦”一梭子。当场四个小子就见了阎王。另外两个急得抱头往回爬，我的机枪“点放”了两下子，这两个也不动弹了。
    敌人还不甘心，又用机枪与大炮掩护着四十多个人上来。到离我们大约有三十几公尺的时候，我的机枪又开了火，打的敌人鬼哭神嚎狼狈逃窜。这一下活着回去的也没有几个。
    这时，敌人有一挺重机枪打的挺紧，声势很凶。我乘便仔细一瞧，看见它离我不远，就向它狠狠地干了两梭子，结果它就变成哑叭了。
    可是后来我一想糟了，和敌人打了这大半天，打死的倒不少，就是没抓到一个活的。于是我就向公路前进，刚运动了一下，马上听到旁边有人在嘀咕，一看三个敌人已经窜到了交通壕。我一个箭步上去，大喊一声：“兔崽子，你们来得正好！”其中一个小子和我同时开了枪，但是他因为已被吓慌了，枪没打准，只把我衣服穿了一个窟窿。我的机枪点放了一下，就把他打倒了。剩下的两个家伙，一个拿着鸭嘴手榴弹；一个端着卡宾枪要打。这时我的子弹已经打完了，我情急生智，用枪托狠命向拿手榴弹的那个小子头上一砸，结果这家伙就坐倒在地下，手里的手榴弹开了花，把他自己的屁股也炸烂了。我又回头一抡，不知那里来的一股劲，把另一个小子的肩膀捣了个核桃大的窟窿。正好旁边有个防空洞，他没命地往里钻，可是枪露在外边。我一手夺过来，就把他禁闭在防空洞里了。回头一看没屁股的家伙，正要拿枪打我，我就用刚夺来的枪结束了这小子的性命。接着我就大声喊道：“排长，排长！快来啊！‘舌头’捉到了！”排长笑着跑来，“哈啰！哈啰！”连喊了几声，钻在洞里的鬼子才爬了出来。这样，我们就胜利地完成了捉“舌头”的任务。
