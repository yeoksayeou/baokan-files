Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 11th: The first sub-group of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, which went deep into various parts of the Northwest to deliver reports, has successfully completed its mission.

The sub-group, consisting of over 100 members and performing artists, led by Head Li Furen and Deputy Heads Zhou Jingwen, Xu Baokui, Zeng Zhenwu, and Zakelov (Uyghur), arrived in Xi'an in late June and divided into five teams to conduct reporting in various parts of the Northwest. Over the past three months, they have visited 220 counties, cities, and banners in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, delivering over 200 reports to the broad masses of 17 ethnic groups in the Northwest, with an audience of over 2 million people. Among them, 300,000 cadres, propagandists, and activists are preparing to further disseminate the information to the masses. The sub-group's performing arts team also performed 261 times in various places, with an audience of 860,000 people.

The delegation's reports have once again provided widespread patriotic and internationalist education to the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest. The delegation was warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups wherever they went, who expressed their determination to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions. Jin Zhanhui, the Imam of the Dingyuan Camp Mosque in Ningxia, said, "In the past, I thought the United States was a 'civilized' country, but now I know it is a beast that slaughters the Korean people and endangers world peace." More than 200 workers from the Bayandai Coal Mine in Xinjiang requested to go to the front lines in Korea to kill the enemy. Zhang Tianxi's mother from Donghe Township, Danfeng County, Shaanxi, said with tears in her eyes: "Even a three-year-old child is grateful for the kindness of the Volunteers. Without the Volunteers, how could we live in peace and happiness?"

Over the past three months, the delegation's propaganda work has powerfully promoted the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement in various parts of the Northwest. While discussing the delegation's reports, people in various places universally reviewed, revised, and supplemented patriotic covenants. Preliminary statistics from Xi'an City and various counties in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, show that roughly 60 percent of the people have signed patriotic covenants. In many places, after listening to the reports, the people immediately launched enthusiastic donations. The people of Baoji, Nanzheng, and Ankang Special Districts in Shaanxi Province donated over 156 million yuan on the spot. Mu Hanmaiti's wife, a herdsman from Tekes, Xinjiang, said: "After listening to the delegation's report this time, I realized the principle that only with a country can there be a home. In the past, my family thought donating two foals was too much, but now we think it's too little." Various places also universally and conscientiously reviewed preferential treatment work, criticized the task-oriented and purely relief-oriented views of some cadres in the past preferential treatment work, and many people incorporated doing a good job in preferential treatment work into their patriotic covenants.

Head Li Furen, Deputy Heads Zhou Jingwen, Xu Baokui, and other representatives have successively returned to Beijing by car.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 13th: The reporting work carried out by the Southwest Sub-Group of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea in the vast Southwest region over the past few months has basically come to an end. Currently, only some members are continuing their work in the 15 counties of the Pu'er Special District on the Yunnan border.

With the cooperation of some members of the General Delegation's Directly Subordinate Sub-Group, the Seventh Sub-Group, and the Quyi Brigade, the delegation went to various provinces and regions in the Southwest to report after conducting a report in Chongqing at the end of June. Over the past three months, the delegation has traveled through 358 counties and cities in seven provinces and regions in the Southwest, traversing the Kangzang Plateau, the Yunnan border, the old revolutionary base areas on the borders of Sichuan and Shaanxi, and the mountainous areas of Guizhou, delivering more than 1,120 reports to people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, with a direct audience of over 4 million people. In addition, there were about 500,000 people who listened to the delegation's broadcasts. The Quyi Team, Acrobatic Troupe, Music Working Group, and Art Working Group, which cooperated with the delegation, performed nearly 500 times in various places, with an audience of over 2.5 million people.

Wherever the delegation went, the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life warmly welcomed them. When they worked in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang, many Tibetans brought tents, butter, and zanba from dozens of miles away to listen to their reports. The delegation also received a large number of banners, letters of appreciation, and other gifts from the people of various ethnic groups in various places for the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The work of the sub-group over the past few months has once again universally provided patriotic education to the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas and to the minority ethnic groups in the Southwest, and has greatly promoted the movement to donate airplanes and cannons, the patriotic covenant movement, and the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers in various parts of the Southwest. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region, the lamas of Tagong Temple, who rarely worked, were also inspired to go up the mountains to dig medicinal herbs and donate the proceeds to purchase airplanes and cannons. After the delegation delivered a report in Sinan County, Guizhou Province, the number of villages in the county that established patriotic covenants greatly increased, from one-fifth to two-thirds.

In addition to conducting reports in various parts of the Southwest, the sub-group also visited the troops entering Tibet and the People's Liberation Army guarding the Yunnan border.

    中国人民赴朝慰问团两个分团
    在西北西南广大地区作了传达报告
    【新华社西安十一日电】深入西北各地进行传达报告的中国人民赴朝慰问团第一分团已胜利完成任务。
    该分团团员及文工队员一百多人，由李敷仁团长，周鲸文、许宝骙、曾震五和扎克洛夫（维吾尔族）副团长率领，六月下旬到西安后，分成五队，深入西北各地进行传达报告；三个多月来，先后到达陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆五省的二百二十个县、市、旗，向西北十七个民族的广大群众作了二百多次报告，听众在二百万人以上，其中准备再向群众进行传达的干部、宣传员、和积极分子有三十万人。该分团文工队并在各地演出二百六十一场，观众达八十六万人。
    慰问团的传达报告，使西北各族人民再一次普遍受到了爱国主义和国际主义教育。慰问团所到之处，深受各族人民的热烈欢迎，他们纷纷表示要用实际行动，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。宁夏定远营清真寺教长金占辉说：“过去我以为美国是个‘文明’国家，现在我才知道它是残杀朝鲜人民、危害世界和平的野兽。”新疆巴颜岱煤矿二百多工人要求到朝鲜前线去杀敌。陕西丹凤县东河乡张天喜妈热泪盈眶地说：“三岁娃娃都感谢志愿军的恩情，没有志愿军，咱怎能过着太平安乐的日子。”
    三个多月以来，慰问团的宣传工作，有力的推进了西北各地的抗美援朝爱国运动。各地人民都曾在讨论慰问团报告的同时，普遍检查、修订和补订了爱国公约。西安市和陕西省关中各县初步统计，大体上已有百分之六十的人民订了爱国公约。很多地方的人民群众在听完报告后，当场就展开了热烈的捐献，陕西宝鸡、南郑、安康三个专区的人民群众当场献金一亿五千六百余万元。新疆特克斯牧民穆汗买提的女人说：“这次听了慰问团的报告，我认识了有国才能有家的道理，以前我家捐两只马驹嫌多，现在却嫌少了。”各地并普遍认真地检查了优抚工作，批判了某些干部过去在优抚工作中存在的任务观点和单纯的救济观点，很多人都把做好优抚工作订入爱国公约。
    现该分团李敷仁团长，周鲸文、许宝骙副团长及其他代表已先后乘车返京。
    【新华社重庆十三日电】中国人民赴朝慰问团西南分团数月来在西南广大地区进行的传达工作已基本结束，现仅部分团员尚在云南省边防的普洱专区十五县继续工作。
    该团在总团直属分团、第七分团部分团员及曲艺大队队员配合下，于六月底在重庆进行传达报告后，即分赴西南各省、区报告。三个多月来，该团历经西南区七个省、区三百五十八个县、市，走遍康藏高原、云南边疆、川陕边老根据地和贵州山区，向各族各界人民作报告达一千一百二十多次，直接听众在四百万人以上，尚有收听该团广播的约五十多万人。配合慰问团工作的曲艺队、杂技团、音乐工作团、文艺工作团在各地演出近五百次，观众达二百五十万人以上。
    该团所到之处，各族各界人民无不热忱欢迎。当他们在西康藏族自治区工作时，许多藏民带着帐篷、酥油、?粑从几十里外赶来听他们的报告。该团并收到了各地各族人民献给中国人民志愿军的大批锦旗、慰问信及其他礼品。
    该分团数月来的工作，使西南区广大城乡人民和少数民族人民又一次普遍受到爱国主义教育，并大大推进了西南各地的捐献飞机大炮运动、爱国公约运动和优待烈属军属的工作。藏族自治区，塔公寺的很少劳动的喇嘛们也被激励起来上山挖药材，以所得之款捐献购买飞机大炮。慰问团在贵州省思南县作了报告后，该县订立爱国公约村庄的数字大为增加，由原来的五分之一增加到三分之二。
    该分团除在西南各地进行传达报告外，并慰问了入藏部队和守卫在云南边疆的人民解放军。
