    Study the Marriage Law Well, Don't Let Bad Elements Exploit Loopholes
    ——After Reading the Article on Teng Guifen of Jinhua County Being Forced to Commit Suicide

To the Editor:

    The judgment of the Jinhua County People's Court of Zhejiang Province regarding the bad element in Pukou Village who took the opportunity to force someone to death is indeed, as the People's Daily editor said, "too lenient."

    The bad element Yu Zhangquan attempted to interfere with the free love of Yu Xianbang and Teng Guifen, incited the masses, attacked activists in the land reform (having already forced Teng Guifen to death), and diverted the masses' struggle target in the land reform. This behavior is a planned counter-revolutionary act. Such bad elements should be resolutely suppressed, or at least forced to undergo long-term labor reform; otherwise, righteousness cannot prevail, and the interests of the people will be harmed.

    One reason why the bad element Yu Zhangquan was able to force Teng Guifen to death is that Teng Guifen herself was weak and did not fight resolutely. Another reason is that the cadres and masses of Pukou Village did not understand the Marriage Law well enough, which gave Yu Zhangquan an opportunity to carry out destructive activities. This also reminds us that we must study the Marriage Law well, publicize the Marriage Law to the masses, raise vigilance, and strictly prevent bad elements from exploiting loopholes.

### 好好学习婚姻法，不让坏分子钻空子——读金华县滕桂芬被迫自杀一文后

    好好学习婚姻法，不让坏分子钻空子
    ——读金华县滕桂芬被迫自杀一文后编辑同志：
    浙江金华县人民法院对浦口村坏分子乘机逼死人命的判决，确如人民日报编者所说，“是过轻的”。
    坏分子俞章全企图通过干涉俞宪邦、滕桂芬的自由恋爱，鼓动群众，打击土地改革中的积极分子（已逼死滕桂芬），转移群众在土地改革中的斗争目标，这种行为，是一种有计划的反革命行为。对这样的坏分子，应该予以坚决镇压，至少应强制他进行长期劳动改造，否则正气不能抬头，人民利益就会受到损失。
    坏分子俞章全之所以能逼死滕桂芬，一方面是因为滕桂芬本身软弱，没有坚决斗争下去；另一方面，是因为浦口村干部及群众对婚姻法了解不够，给了俞章全进行破坏活动以可乘之机。由此也提醒了我们：一定要好好学习婚姻法，向群众宣传婚姻法，提高警惕，严防坏分子钻空子。
