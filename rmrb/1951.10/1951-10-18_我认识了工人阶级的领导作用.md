I Understand the Leadership of the Working Class
Xiao Kaiyan, Agricultural Labor Model of Chahar Province

After visiting the North China Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin, I have taken a step forward in my understanding of cities and the working class.

First, I realized that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the relationship between city dwellers and villagers has changed dramatically. I remember in 1947, when the Kuomintang ruled Zhangjiakou City, I was driven by the landlord from my home (Shabuye Village, Shangyi County) with a cart to Zhangjiakou City to sell grain. As soon as I entered the inn, the landlord, afraid that I would not feed the livestock well, said to me, "Feed the livestock well in the inn, and don't go out on the street, or you might get run over by a car!" I didn't dare to step out of the inn. After staying for two days, I drove the empty cart out. Passing a small shop, I bought a dry tobacco pipe. Before I could leave the shop, I saw that the tobacco pipe was broken. I wanted to exchange it, but the merchant not only refused to exchange it but also scolded me severely. From then on, I felt that city people were all bad people, and farmers couldn't go to the city. This time when I came to Tianjin for a visit, I was still a little worried, afraid that city people would look down on villagers. Who knew that as soon as I got off the train, workers, students, and citizens welcomed and entertained us like brothers. I was so moved that I couldn't even speak. I thought that in the new China led by Chairman Mao, city people and villagers had become one family.

Secondly, I truly realized that without the leadership of the working class, the Chinese revolution could not have been victorious. At home, higher-level cadres often educated me this way, and I also educated the peasants this way, but I was always unconvinced, always thinking: Without farmers growing crops, everyone would starve.

This time, when I visited the Agricultural Production Materials Hall, I saw that the various machines created by the worker comrades were truly remarkable. Take the new-style farm tools as an example: the "single-animal seeder" created by the worker comrades completes ditching, sowing, and covering the soil in one go, and can sow 40 to 60 mu of land in one day. If a tractor is used, the efficiency will be even greater. We drove an old ox team and worked hard, at most planting about ten mu a day. This is really incomparable to planting with new-style farm tools. The many creations of the worker comrades broadened my horizons, and I have more confidence in the future of agricultural production. I realize that in our motherland, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the working class, we farmers will definitely overcome difficulties, defeat the aggression of American imperialism, and better build our new country.

When I go back, I will definitely work hard to publicize and ensure the following four things are done well: (1) Lead the masses of the whole village to plant more cash crops to ensure the supply of raw materials for urban industries. Next year, I will first plant 20 mu of flax on my own 30 mu of land, and lead the villagers to use half of their land to grow cash crops. (2) I will lead the masses to build water conservancy projects and develop production. First, I plan to dig 30 wells in our village and prepare to buy or borrow ten waterwheels. (3) Tell everyone in the village to value bristles, casings, wool, and flax straw, and suggest that the village government organize a local product sales committee, combined with the village cooperative, to continuously transport local products to the city, do a good job of urban-rural mutual assistance, and develop production. (4) Work hard to learn and promote the production experience of Labor Model Li Shunda, promote the use of new-style farm tools created by the worker comrades, and improve our agricultural production.

    我认识了工人阶级的领导作用
    察哈尔省农业劳动模范  萧凯彦
    这次我到天津参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会后，使我对城市和工人阶级的认识提高了一步。
    首先，我认识到在共产党毛主席领导下，城里人和乡下人的关系大变了。我想起一九四七年国民党统治张家口市的时候，我由家里（尚义县沙卜窑村）给地主赶着大车到张家口市糶粮食，一进客店大门，地主怕我喂不好牲口，就对我说：“好好在店里喂牲口，不要出街去，小心让汽车给压死！”我连一步也不敢出店门，住了两天就赶着空车出来。路过一家小商店，我买了一个旱烟锅。我还没有出店门，一看那旱烟锅是坏的，我想换一换，不料那商人不但不给换，还大骂了我一顿。从那以后，我觉得城里人都是坏人，种地人不能进城。这次来天津参观，我思想里还有点发愁，恐怕城里人瞧不起乡下人。谁知一下火车，工人、学生、市民就像哥儿兄弟一样地欢迎招待我们。感动得我连话都说不出来，我想着毛主席领导的新中国，城里人和乡村人已经成了一家人。
    其次我又真正认识到，没有工人阶级的领导，中国革命就不能胜利。在家，上级干部常这样教育我，我也这样教育农民，可是心里老不服，总想着：没有农民种庄稼，谁都得饿肚子。
    这回参观农业生产资料馆时，我看到工人老大哥创造的各种机器实在了不起，就拿新式农具来说：工人老大哥创造的“单畜播种机”，开沟、下种、复土一回做完，一天就能种四十到六十亩地。要再用上拖拉机，那就效率更大了。我们赶上一套老牛犋，拼上命干，一天顶多种上十来亩，这和用新式农具种地实在不能相比。工人老大哥的许多创造使我长了见识，我对农业生产的前途更有了信心，我认识到我们祖国在共产党、毛主席领导下，我们农民在工人阶级的帮助下，一定能克服困难，一定能打败美帝国主义的侵略，更好的建设我们的新国家。
    我回去一定要努力宣传，保证做好以下四件事：（一）带动全村群众多种经济作物，保证供给城市工业原料。明年我先把自己的三十亩地种二十亩胡麻，并带动全村的乡亲们，拿出一半地来种经济作物。（二）我要领导群众兴办水利，发展生产。首先计划在我们村打三十眼井，并准备买或贷买十辆水车。（三）告诉给全村人，把猪鬃、肠衣、羊毛、胡麻秸看重起来，并建议村政府组织土产推销委员会，和村合作社结合起来，把土产不断运到城市来，做好城乡互助，发展生产。（四）努力学习，推广李顺达劳动模范的生产经验，推广使用工人老大哥创造出来的新式农具，提高我们的农业生产。
