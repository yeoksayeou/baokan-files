    The Deeds of the Chinese Sons and Daughters of Cui Jianguo's Platoon Will Forever Be Remembered in the Hearts of the People of the Motherland

To the Editor:
    After reading the article "People of Honor" published on the front page of the People's Daily on October 17th, my infinite respect for the Volunteer Army has increased even more. This article vividly describes the heroic spirit, noble qualities, and lofty sense of honor of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    The glorious Volunteer Army commanders and fighters Cui Jianguo, Wang Laicheng, Tao Quan, Shen Xueli...they will forever be remembered in the hearts of the people of the motherland. Whenever the people of the motherland think of them, they will feel proud, because their honor is also the honor of our motherland and our people.

    "Honor" is the noblest title, but "honor is not a cheap thing." How true is this maxim of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! The honor of "Cui Jianguo's Platoon of Chinese Sons and Daughters" was obtained through arduous struggle.

    After reading the newsletter "People of Honor," it has added strength to my work and study. I believe the people of the motherland will feel the same as I do. We would like to extend our cordial greetings and heartfelt respect to the "lovable people" and "people of honor" who are victoriously fighting the American invaders on the front lines, and hope that they will bring more honor to the motherland.

    中华儿女崔建国排的事迹将永远记在祖国人民心里编辑同志：
    我看了人民日报十月十七日第一版发表的“荣誉的人”一文后，更增加了我对志愿军的无限崇敬。这篇文章生动地描写出中国人民志愿军的英雄气概、高贵品质和他们的崇高的荣誉心。
    光荣的志愿军指战员崔建国、王来成、陶泉、申学礼……他们将永远记忆在祖国人民的心里。当每一个祖国的人民想起他们的时候，都会感到骄傲，因为他们的荣誉也就是我们祖国和人民的荣誉。
    “荣誉”是最高贵的称呼，但“荣誉不是廉价的东西”，中国人民志愿军的这一句格言，是多么千真万确呀！“中华儿女崔建国排”的荣誉，就是从艰苦斗争中取得的。
    读了“荣誉的人”这篇通讯以后，使我的工作与学习都增添了力量。我相信祖国的人民都会和我一样。我们要向在前线胜利地打击美国侵略者的“可爱的人”和“荣誉的人”们致以亲切的慰问和衷心的敬意，并希望他们给祖国带来更多的荣誉。
