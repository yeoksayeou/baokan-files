    Don't Let Imperialism Divide Our Workers and Peasants Again!
    Yang Jiaxiang, Cotton Textile Factory No. 5

    On October 10th, farmer representatives from various parts of North China came to visit the state-owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory. When the workers of the No. 5 Factory heard this news, they were extremely excited; slogans like "You grow cotton, I spin yarn, we workers and peasants are one family" were immediately posted all over the factory. Workers in groups like Cao Jiangfeng and Zhou Zhenqun's were competing to welcome their peasant brothers with practical actions of improving production and quality.

    During the visit, a farmer representative from Renqiu County, after listening to my explanation of the quality of Da Wu Fu cloth, said happily: "From now on, we can all wear good white cloth! Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, nothing is too difficult for us." Another female farmer representative from Tianjin County said: "In the past, we grew rice ourselves, but couldn't afford to eat rice; we grew cotton, but still didn't have clothes to wear. Today is completely different! No one will exploit us anymore, and we must grow more grain and more cotton in the future." Hearing their words, I immediately felt both sad and happy. Sad about the suffering of the Chinese people under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang in the past, and happy about our great future in the construction of the new China.

    Thinking back to why we didn't have such days in the past? It was because those enemies at home and abroad were constantly trying to divide our workers and peasants. They didn't want us to unite, fearing that if we united, they would not be able to rule. Today, our workers, peasants, and other laboring people have all turned over! Especially through this North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition, our worker-peasant alliance has become closer and more consolidated.

    不让帝国主义再挑拨我们工农分家！
    棉纺五厂  杨家祥
    十月十日，华北各地农民代表来到国营天津第五棉纺织厂参观。当五厂职工听到了这个消息时，都兴奋异常；“你种棉，我纺纱，咱们工农是一家”等标语马上贴遍了全厂。像曹江峰和周振群小组的工友们，都在比赛着要以提高产量质量的实际行动来迎接自己的农民弟兄们。
    在参观时，一位任邱县的农民代表听完了我的关于大五福布成色的解释后，他高兴地说：“今后咱们可尽穿好白布了！在共产党和毛主席的领导下，没有难得住我们的事。”另一位天津县的女农民代表说：“以前我们自己种了稻子，但吃不起大米；种了棉花，但仍没有衣裳穿。今天可完全不同啦！再也没有人来剥削我们了，我们以后一定要多打粮食，多种棉花。”我听了他（她）们的话，立时觉得又心酸又高兴，心酸的是过去中国人民在帝国主义和国民党统治下所受的苦难，高兴的是今后我们在新中国建设里的伟大前途。
    回想过去为什么没有这种日子呢？就是因为那些国内外的敌人时刻地在挑拨我们工农分家。他们不让我们团结，深怕我们团结起来，他们就无法统治了。今天，我们工人、农民和其他爱好劳动的人们都翻了身啦！尤其通过了这次华北区城乡物资交流展览会，使我们的工农联盟更加密切，更加巩固了。
