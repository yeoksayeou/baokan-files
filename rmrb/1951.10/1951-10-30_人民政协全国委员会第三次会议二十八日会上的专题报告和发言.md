**Strengthening Judicial Work to Consolidate the People's Democratic Dictatorship**

Chairman, Comrades, and Delegates:

Over the past year, our country has achieved glorious victories and great accomplishments on the battlefield of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, as well as in national defense, politics, economy, and culture. These achievements are worth celebrating and are a source of pride for us. The primary reason for these great accomplishments is the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, which has mobilized and continues to mobilize the boundless energy of the Chinese people. We have defeated the enemy and overcome difficulties, making our country more consolidated and stronger.

The work of the people's courts was reported on at the second session of the National Committee last year, and resolutions were passed by the conference. All levels of people's courts have seriously implemented these resolutions.

In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, since the joint directive issued by the State Council and the Supreme People's Court in July last year to suppress counter-revolutionary activities, various places have corrected the tendency of being too lenient. Especially after the nationwide campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries was launched, all levels of people's courts, in cooperation with public security and procuratorial organs, have tried and punished a large number of counter-revolutionary criminals, implementing the policy of combining suppression with leniency, and seriousness with caution. Under the correct leadership of the central authorities, relying on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, we have eliminated a large number of counter-revolutionaries, further consolidating our state.

Regarding judicial work in land reform, in areas where land reform is being carried out or prepared, people's courts have been established. These courts have closely combined with the struggles against bandits, landlords, rent reduction, deposit refunds, land distribution, and re-examinations, punishing the resistance of the landlord class and other counter-revolutionary activities, supporting the revolutionary actions of the masses, and ensuring that the movement develops in an orderly manner. Local people's courts have assisted in the establishment of people's courts and the allocation and training of personnel, actively supporting and guiding the work of people's courts. Experience has shown that people's courts are powerful weapons for suppressing reactionaries, safeguarding farmers' rights, raising political awareness among farmers, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

Regarding the clearance of backlog cases, after the second session of the National Committee last year, we made arrangements at the first national judicial conference in July and issued a directive from the State Council and the Supreme People's Court in November on the speedy clearance of backlog cases by judicial organs. Under the leadership of various levels of government and with the assistance of relevant departments, not only have a large number of counter-revolutionary cases been promptly cleared, but a large number of ordinary criminal and civil cases have also been handled. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year, all levels of people's courts handled 820,285 first-instance criminal and civil cases, realizing the significant role of people's courts in suppressing reactionaries and protecting the people. At present, there are still backlog cases in various places. Therefore, we must strive to implement the provisional regulations on the organization of people's courts, establish a basic three-tier, two-instance system, establish district people's courts in central and directly-administered municipalities, strengthen the leadership of people's governments at all levels over people's courts, and continue to implement the mass line in handling cases. We must make multi-faceted efforts to solve the problem of backlog cases.

Judicial cadres have undergone work and study over the past year, especially after studying the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, their political and professional levels have improved, and the internal affairs of the organs have become more pure. However, the current level of cadres still does not meet the needs of the work, and we must continue to strive to improve.

Currently, another major issue in judicial work is how to implement the Marriage Law. Since its promulgation, the Marriage Law has played a significant role in dismantling the feudal marriage system and establishing a new marriage system. According to incomplete statistics from the Central South Region for the first half of this year, there have been over 23,600 couples who have freely married. However, the implementation of the Marriage Law is still a serious struggle against feudalism. In many places, remnants of feudal ideology are fiercely resisting, and our propaganda of the Marriage Law is insufficient, and our support for the masses' struggle against feudal marriage is inadequate, resulting in a large number of incidents where women are killed or forced to commit suicide. This is an urgent problem that must be seriously addressed. The State Council has recently issued a directive on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law to protect women's rights. The Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, People's Supervisory Commission, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of the Interior, Legal Committee, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, along with other relevant organs and organizations, have made arrangements based on this directive and jointly organized a central inspection team to inspect various places. Currently, local judicial organs are cooperating with relevant organs to vigorously propagate and implement the Marriage Law through trials and other activities, using the power of judicial work to safeguard women's rights and freedoms, and to punish and educate those who infringe upon women's interests. We must do a good job in this regard.

Now, the provisional regulations on the organization of people's courts, the provisional regulations on the organization of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the organizational regulations for local people's procuratorates have all been promulgated and implemented. To implement these three regulations and advance the construction of the people's judiciary, based on our work experience over the past year, we must correctly solve the following issues.

First, the issue of understanding the people's judiciary: The army, police, and courts are important weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship. The basic task of judicial organs is to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Judicial organs, on the one hand, protect the legal rights of the people, and on the other hand, exercise dictatorship over the reactionary classes and reactionaries. However, in many cadres, this understanding is not clear, and they treat the state's judicial work (which is the most political work) as a purely technical matter, not using it as a weapon to protect democracy and exercise dictatorship. Therefore, judicial work has not played its due role. We must overcome this shortcoming.

Second, the relationship between judiciary and politics: Our laws are the concentrated expression of the people's will and the concretization and codification of state policies. It is wrong to discuss laws without politics. After laws are formed, they also have their independent functions, and denying this is also wrong. However, many cadres do not have a clear understanding of the correct relationship between laws and politics, wrongly opposing laws and politics, or placing laws above politics, or hindering the independent function of laws, thereby causing judicial work to be detached from politics in practice; either making judicial work detached from the current political center tasks and mass movements, or neglecting the importance of judicial work to the people's democratic dictatorship. Our judicial work must actively serve politics, must be combined with the current political center tasks and mass movements. In various center tasks and movements, local leading organs should organize judicial work, pay attention to using this weapon, and make the center work better. Judicial organs themselves should actively and proactively cooperate with center tasks and movements, fully playing the role of the people's judiciary.

Third, the mass line in judicial work: Judicial work is work that relies on the people, is convenient for the people, and serves the people. Judicial workers should wholeheartedly serve the people; therefore, the mass line is a fundamental issue in judicial work. The three regulations recently promulgated by the Central People's Government have implemented this fundamental principle of the mass line. For example, the basic three-tier, two-instance system, people's assessors, on-site investigations, on-site trials, circuit trials, the public conduct of cases and public trials, the establishment of branches, and through the trial of criminal and civil cases and other activities, conducting legal and disciplinary propaganda and education for the litigants and the general public, as well as through people's congresses, public discussions of cases, and public denunciations of cases, all can be used to specifically explain this issue.

Fourth, the issue of dual leadership and cooperation: Judicial organs are part of the people's political power and are fundamentally different from the so-called "judicial independence" of the bourgeoisie. Although the people's judicial work is different from general administrative work and has its own characteristics, the trial of specific cases should be conducted independently. However, regarding the specific implementation of policies and guidelines, and the leadership and supervision of judicial work, we must recognize the consistency of the centralization and unity of the central authorities with the local adaptation of local conditions. At the current stage, we should not emphasize vertical leadership, causing judicial organs to have a distant relationship with local governments, hindering the strengthening of judicial work. At the same time, our judicial work has a weak foundation and little experience, and there are few cadres. The experience of the past year has proven that judicial work at the current stage not only needs to strengthen unified local leadership but also needs the cooperation of all judicial organs and other relevant organs. Under the current circumstances, we should not overly emphasize the fine division of labor among departments and should not have the "achievement mentality" and "jurisdictional theory" of departmentalism. These tendencies all hinder cooperation. Only by implementing dual leadership and cooperation can we be more beneficial to the construction of judicial work and better strengthen the people's revolutionary legal system.

Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening speech that the current central task of our country is to continue to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production, and practice economy. The people's courts must revolve around this central task, cooperate with public security, procuratorial, and other relevant organs, exert judicial power, continue to deeply suppress counter-revolutionaries, punish lawless landlords, safeguard production and construction, oppose corruption and waste, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and ensure the victory of the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

**Speech by Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Democratic Promotion Association**

**Uniting Cultural and Educational Workers to Study Mao Zedong Thought**

Chairman, Comrades, and Delegates:

During these few days of the conference, I have listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech, the reports by Premier Zhou and other leaders on politics, finance, and culture, and the report by Vice Chairman Chen Chutong of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the Chinese People's Association for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. I am very excited and hereby, on behalf of the China Democratic Promotion Association, solemnly express our heartfelt support for the opening speech and these reports.

Comrades, due to the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese People's Republic was created, making foreign imperialists who bullied the Chinese people disappear forever from China. Due to the genius politician, military strategist, thinker, and educator Chairman Mao Zedong, who combined Marxism-Leninism with Chinese revolutionary practice, leading the Chinese people, after the founding of the People's Republic of China two years ago, established various levels of people's democratic governments nationwide, enabling the people to obtain all their due rights, making the people highly politically aware, making the people truly free, improving the people's lives, enabling the people to enjoy culture and education, making the people no longer suffer from foreign imperialist bullying, making the people the masters of their own country. Comrades, this is the great victory of the people's democratic revolution led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. On behalf of the China Democratic Promotion Association, I express my highest respect and sincere thanks to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.

Since the second session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, our People's Republic of China, as Chairman Mao said, "has achieved brilliant successes and great progress on all fronts." Especially the close unity among all nationalities and the peaceful liberation of Tibet have realized an unprecedented unity in China, proving the invincibility of applying Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades, the old face of China has quickly disappeared, and the new People's China is growing and consolidating; the growth and consolidation of People's China further inspires the oppressed peoples of Asia and the world to look up to us. This is the glory of the Chinese people.

Two years ago, the Chinese People's Liberation Army led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese people defeated the Kuomintang reactionary rulers who were openly supported by American imperialism, making the U.S. State Department helplessly admit an irretrievable defeat in the white paper. However, it still dared to take risks and became the ringleader, launching an unjust war of invading our territory Taiwan and attacking our neighboring country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It thought that the newly born People's China had many difficulties and, catching us off guard, could march straight into our mainland from Korea. Thanks to the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, who raised the political awareness and patriotism and internationalism of the people, the Chinese people launched the movement of volunteering to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend the homeland. Our volunteer army, representing the great will of the people, together with the Korean People's Army, immediately drove the U.S. imperialist aggressors back to the 38th parallel, shattering the arrogant plans of U.S. imperialism, inspiring the Chinese, Korean, Asian, and even the world's peace-loving peoples to defend peace and oppose aggression, increasing the strength of the world peace and democratic camp, and thus raising China's international status to an unprecedented height like the rising sun. "Strong China!" "Strong China!" has been repeatedly expressed by the people of the world. Comrades, our volunteer army is an invincible force and a model for every patriot; on behalf of the China Democratic Promotion Association, I express my highest and warmest respect to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Comrades, victory is definitely ours; the era of imperialist hegemony over the world has been permanently declared over. However, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: to continue this necessary and just struggle, we need to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increase production, practice economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to achieve the final victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; this is the central task of the Chinese people today, and I firmly guarantee that the China Democratic Promotion Association will strive to fulfill this important task.

Premier Zhou Enlai called on us to widely and systematically study Mao Zedong Thought, and we fully support this. Mao Zedong Thought is what the Chinese revolution needs and is truly correct, and should become the guiding ideology of the Chinese people. Promoting the study of Mao Zedong Thought among the people nationwide, arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, is the task of the democratic parties. The main object of unity for the China Democratic Promotion Association is cultural and educational workers. We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, correctly use the methods of criticism and self-criticism to conduct self-education and self-reform, to raise the political awareness of members, and thus unite and influence the masses we are connected with, making them study, progress, and advance with us. I repeat, we sincerely support and are determined to struggle to implement Premier Zhou's call to strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought.

Finally, let me shout:

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Peng Xian, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Commission**

**Promoting the Broad Masses to Increase Production and Practice Economy to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea**

Chairman, Comrades, and Delegates:

We fully agree with and sincerely support Chairman Mao's instructions, Premier Zhou's political report, and the reports by other leaders. We will implement them in our work in the Central-South Region.

Over the past year, the Central-South Region, like other regions, has achieved remarkable results in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and other aspects of work, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao. Regarding the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the entire Central-South Region has penetrated into every city and village, with over 99 million people signing peace pledges, over 98 million people voting against the U.S. imperialists arming Japan, and over 941.5 billion yuan in donations for airplanes and cannons. Comforting the volunteer army, in addition to comfort items, the comfort money totaled over 30 billion yuan by the end of May. Due to the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the political awareness of the people has been further raised, promoting the patriotic production movement, strengthening the unity of the people. Regarding land reform, the Central-South Region has completed land reform in areas with over 68 million agricultural populations, confiscating and levying over 69 million mu of land, distributing it to nearly 40 million landless and land-poor peasants. There are still over 55 million agricultural populations in areas where land reform is expected to be basically completed next year. In areas where land reform has been completed, re-examinations are being carried out. The countryside after land reform has a completely new look, the people's political power is more consolidated, social order is more stable, and production enthusiasm is higher. Regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, since the masses were mobilized and the campaign was launched, a total of about one-sixth of the counter-revolutionaries in the entire region have been executed, about one-fourth have been imprisoned, and most of them have been organized into labor teams to undergo labor reform. Additionally, a batch has been placed under control, and it is estimated that about 80% of the counter-revolutionary leaders have suffered varying degrees of blows. Through the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, not only has the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries been suppressed, but the broad masses have also been educated. Only in this way can the enemy and us be distinguished, and the people's democratic dictatorship be realized. Regarding the suppression of bandits, over the past two years, over 1.06 million bandits have been eliminated in the Central-South Region. Especially in Guangxi and western Hunan, bandits that had never been eliminated in history have been basically eliminated. In remote areas, there are still a few scattered bandits, which will be completely eradicated with the completion of land reform. Regarding financial and economic work, we have followed Chairman Mao's instructions, striving to improve the situation, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the joint efforts of the people of the Central-South Region, we have indeed achieved improvement. First, agricultural production, except for Jiangxi, has been a bumper harvest this year, and the yield has increased compared to last year. Industry has also developed to a considerable extent on the basis of recovery. Next, organizing the exchange of materials and developing cooperatives have made both urban and rural areas prosperous, with a significant increase in the number of industrial and commercial households, and the purchasing power of farmers has generally increased by 25% to 30%. Other aspects such as democratic governance and cultural and educational work, although most of the Central-South Region is a new area and the progress lags behind the old areas, have also achieved some results and laid a preliminary foundation.

We will not be complacent with these initial achievements. We will follow the instructions of Chairman Mao and other leaders at this conference and strive to continue to advance.

First, we firmly support the resolution on the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. We will concentrate our efforts to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the just war in Korea. We will resolutely liberate Taiwan. Here, I want to warn the traitors remaining in Taiwan: you should turn to the motherland, recognize the great victories achieved by the motherland under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, recognize that the great People's Republic of China is the strongest country in the world, and you should strive to redeem your sins and unite with the people of Taiwan to resolutely oppose the arrogant aggression of U.S. imperialism and the betrayal of the motherland by the Kuomintang bandits, and prepare to return to the embrace of the motherland. If you do not do so, you will be punished by the people.

We will complete the land reform in the entire Central-South Region within next year and will seriously carry out re-examinations in areas where land reform has been completed. We will not allow the remnants of feudal forces to ferment. We will seriously investigate and arrest escaped and hidden counter-revolutionaries, doing a thorough job of eliminating evil, and will also do a good job of the arduous task of labor reform for a large number of criminals. We will follow Chairman Mao's instructions and will not relax our vigilance against the remnants of counter-revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao instructed us to increase production and practice economy to continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which is the central task of the Chinese people today. We will follow this instruction and, in combination with the reports by Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen, propose to the upcoming meeting of the Central-South Military and Political Commission to discuss this as an important current task and strive to promote it to form a mass movement. We guarantee and believe that we will achieve great results.

Chairman Mao repeatedly instructed us to unite all possible forces, which is very important. We are all excited and inspired by the great victories of the past year. We should deeply realize that only under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, implementing the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and giving full play to the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship, can we unite the people of the entire country. Only the people of the entire country can fully give play to their boundless energy. Only on this basis can we achieve such great and glorious victories. We unanimously respond to Premier Zhou's call to arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with Chinese revolutionary practice. We will promote the broad masses of the people to systematically and seriously study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong to strengthen the great unity of the Chinese people. We will unite under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and strive for the defense of the motherland, the construction of the motherland, and the defense of world peace.

**Speech by Chen Jiageng, Member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference**

**Loyal Overseas Chinese Will Never Bow to Imperialism**

Chairman, Comrades, and Delegates:

I am honored to attend the third session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and have listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's political report, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and various reports on conference affairs, finance, and culture. I am very excited! On behalf of the overseas Chinese, I express my sincere support for Chairman Mao's call!

Seeing that the Chinese people have stood up, the U.S. imperialists are afraid of our strength and hate our strength, so they occupy our Taiwan, attack our neighboring country Korea, and bomb our Northeast, seriously threatening our national security, which has aroused the indignation of the people nationwide and prompted them to enthusiastically resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend the homeland.

Everyone knows that the U.S. imperialists' attack on Korea is following the old path of the former Japanese imperialists, with the main purpose of attacking our country. Therefore, the significance of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is no less than that of the previous war of resistance against Japan.

The U.S. imperialists also violate the Potsdam Declaration and other international agreements, monopolize Japan, arm Japan, and actively prepare for the third world war, which is indeed the public enemy of all mankind. Looking at history, those who go against reason and violate faith will inevitably fail. The shameful end of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists and the Kuomintang bandits is the most obvious example. The U.S. imperialists will not be an exception. Chairman Mao is right, the final victory will definitely be ours!

Overseas Chinese have always hoped for the independence, freedom, democracy, and prosperity of their motherland. Now this hope has completely become a reality. It is precisely because of this that overseas Chinese are no longer so-called "orphans overseas" but have a great mother, which is the great People's Republic of China! Overseas Chinese who have returned to their motherland due to persecution have received the care and attention of the people's government, which is unprecedented. Only the government of the People's Republic of China led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party can do this!

Over a thousand overseas Chinese abroad, during the war of resistance against Japan, enthusiastically supported the motherland's resistance. This is known to all. Now, many places where overseas Chinese reside are directly or indirectly under the oppression of U.S. imperialism. Because of their hostility towards our country, they also hate our patriotic overseas Chinese; at the same time, the Kuomintang bandits' special agents and running dogs collude with imperialism, and the reactionary governments use every means to harm patriotic overseas Chinese, making the situation of overseas Chinese very difficult. However, I can tell you that the patriotic spirit of the broad overseas Chinese will never bow to imperialism; the hearts of patriotic overseas Chinese and the hearts of compatriots at home are forever united.

**Speech by Fan Yong, Squad Leader of the Railway Construction Team for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea**

**Volunteer Railway Workers for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea Guarantee the Supply of Frontline Materials**

Chairman, Comrades, and Delegates:

I speak on behalf of the volunteer railway workers for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

We Chinese railway workers are honored to participate in the volunteer army for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which is the glory of Chinese railway workers and the glory of the Chinese people.

The transportation lines in Korea are the most tense part of the Korean battlefield. The American bandits, unable to defeat us with real guns and bullets on the front line, are plotting against our transportation lines. Relying on their numerous airplanes, they relentlessly bomb our transportation lines. In July this year, Korea experienced a severe flood that had not occurred in decades, washing away all the railway bridges. The American bandits took this opportunity to even more frantically bomb our railway lines, with hundreds of planes bombing day and night in shifts, leaving our railways severely damaged. They thought that by cutting off our transportation lines, our frontline troops would have to fight on empty stomachs with empty guns, and they thought they could subdue us and the Korean people. They boasted about their bombing achievements and publicly announced that they had seen in their dreams that "our railways are not passable." However, in reality, their calculations were completely wrong. As Chairman Mao said, "Their thoughts are arrogant, futile, and impossible to achieve their goals." Our frontline troops are becoming stronger and stronger, more and more well-equipped, and are annihilating tens of thousands of American bandits.

It is true that the enemy's bombing has caused us a lot of difficulties, and there will be more difficulties in the future. However, we volunteer railway workers and the railway troops have never bowed our heads in the face of any difficulties. When difficulties are in front of us, we think of Chairman Mao's instructions, and we gain strength; hearing about the achievements of national construction and the victories on the Korean front, we feel excited; seeing the Korean people's love for us like family and the Korean railway workers' brave and tenacious fighting spirit, we gain confidence. We and the Korean railway workers are united like brothers, fighting and learning together. In difficulties, we have learned to deal with the enemy's "timed bombs," "mother bombs," "flare bombs," and other special skills; we have also learned to repair lines, bridges, and wires under the enemy's bombing and strafing and coastal artillery fire. Our work efficiency has increased by several times to more than ten times, that is, the repair speed has increased by several times to more than ten times. For example, in the past, repairing a section of the railway that was blown up, filling the pit, and laying tracks often took a day, but now it can be repaired in one and a half hours. We have also learned to drive trains under the enemy's bombing and strafing, and there are "daredevils" who "dare to run through flare bombs" and "dare to run through coastal artillery fire" among our workers; we have also learned to cooperate closely with our anti-aircraft units to fight resolutely against the enemy's bombing. Because we have persisted in the struggle and learning, our railways have exceeded the enemy's expectations and are not "not passable" or "less passable," but are often passable and more passable. The supply of materials is not "not passable," but is more passable. For example, in October, although the railways suffered severe bombing, the transportation volume in half a month was almost equal to the transportation volume of a month in the past.

These facts prove what? They prove that in the era of Mao Zedong, there is no difficulty that workers and the people cannot overcome. Following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, no force can block our path forward. At the same time, they prove another truth, that is, in dealing with imperialist bandits, one must be resolute and not hesitant. If you are hesitant, they will become more ferocious; if you resolutely beat them, they will run away with their tails between their legs.

This time, we returned to the country to participate in the National Day celebrations and saw that after the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the political awareness of the people nationwide has been further raised, the unity has been further strengthened, the construction of the motherland has made great progress, and everywhere is full of prosperity. This time, we attended the third session of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech and the reports by Premier Zhou, Vice Chairman Chen, Vice Chairman Peng, Vice Premier Chen, and Vice Premier Guo. All the things we saw and heard made us excited, feeling that our strength behind us is boundless, and we are full of energy. At the same time, we also feel that our work still has many shortcomings. After returning to Korea, we must convey the prosperity of the motherland and the instructions of Chairman Mao and other leaders to all volunteer railway workers for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the railway troops. We will definitely unite more closely with the Korean railway workers and our fighting troops, continue the struggle, respond to Chairman Mao's call to continue to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increase production, and practice economy, and continue to strengthen the struggle against enemy bombing. In terms of production, we must achieve the shortening of railway repair time, the increase of train pulling tonnage, the extension of locomotive running distance, and the improvement of train travel speed. In terms of economy, we must achieve the saving of repair materials and maintenance materials, the saving of locomotive fuel and lubricants, and the saving of the use of train cars. We will use these methods to further improve the transportation efficiency of the railways to meet the expectations of Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland. We will guarantee the supply of frontline materials, enabling the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to annihilate more American invaders and strive for the victory of the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

Long live our beloved motherland, the People's Republic of China!
Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources of the Central People's Government**

**The Achievements of Water Conservancy Are the Victories of Mao Zedong Thought**

Chairman, Comrades, and Delegates:

In this conference, I have listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech and the reports by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen, Vice Premier Guo, and Vice Chairman Peng on various aspects of the national situation. I fully support these reports. From these reports, we can see the great and profound changes that the victory of the people's revolutionary war and the establishment of the people's democratic system have brought to our country and the world. In just two years, through the deepening of the three major movements of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we have truly become an independent and strong country, an important pillar for maintaining peace in Asia and the world, especially on the frontline of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we have already dealt a severe blow to the aggressive group led by U.S. imperialism. All these victories are reflected in the domestic economic life as the rapid development of various production undertakings. In the future, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, take increasing production, practicing economy, and supporting the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as the center of all work, to achieve greater victories. Now, I would like to talk about some of my thoughts on the development of water conservancy in our country over the past two years, to verify the reports of Chairman Mao and other leaders.

Water conservancy includes two aspects: preventing water disasters and developing water resources. The current work, based on the overall plan of national construction, first focuses on solving the problems of flood control and irrigation to match agricultural production recovery and development.

In the past, the seriousness of water disasters in our country is well known. To give a few prominent examples, in 1931, the Huaihe and Yangtze Rivers flooded over 150 million mu of land, and in 1949, the entire country flooded over 100 million mu of land. However, in the past two years, the flood control situation of rivers nationwide has fundamentally changed. What was previously unsafe is now guaranteed to a certain extent, and what was previously lowly guaranteed is now relatively high. Because water conservancy is the urgent need of the broad masses, in 1950, the national expenditure on water conservancy was 18 times the maximum annual expenditure of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and in 1951, it was 42 times. Over the past two years, the total number of civilians mobilized for water conservancy projects nationwide has reached 1,037,000, and 320,000 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have assisted in the work, totaling over 500 million workdays. The total number of large and small structures built is 11,283, and the total volume of earthwork is 959,000,000 cubic meters. If built into a levee one meter high and one meter wide, it can encircle the equator 24 times. The efficiency of earthwork has also significantly improved, from 1.5 cubic meters per person per day in the past to an average of over 4 cubic meters in Henan Province this year. Through such a massive project, the main rivers nationwide, totaling 42,000 kilometers of levees, have all undergone heightening, thickening, and reinforcement of embankments and protection of riverbanks. Some rivers have even begun to implement fundamental projects.

To give a few major examples, before liberation, the Yellow River would have a 75% chance of breaching if the flow at Shanzhou exceeded 10,000 cubic meters per second. After liberation, in 1949, it was guaranteed that the flow at Shanzhou would not cause a breach at 16,500 cubic meters per second, and in 1950, it was guaranteed that the flow at Shanzhou would not cause a breach at 17,000 cubic meters per second. This year, in the Henan Plain between the Linhuang Dike and the Beijin Dike, a flood detention project was built, which can guarantee that the flow at Shanzhou will not cause a breach at 23,000 cubic meters per second. Before the implementation of fundamental projects, the safety of the people in the Yellow River basin has been initially guaranteed.

In 1931, the Yangtze River flooded 89 million mu of land, and in 1949, it flooded over 20 million mu of land. The most dangerous section is the Jingjiang Dike in Hubei Province (the levee on the north bank of the Yangtze River from Shashi to Jingzhou), where the Yangtze River, due to the narrow river channel, cannot accommodate a large flood, threatening the safety of 3 million people and 80 million mu of land. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the riverbed was silted up for a long time, making the situation more dangerous. The fundamental project is not something that can be started in the short term, so to prevent the occurrence of extraordinary floods and cause huge disasters, this year, temporary flood diversion projects have been started in the southern bank of Taipingkou and the eastern bank of the Hupo River, and the northern bank of the Ouzi River and the northern bank of the Ouzi River, which are estimated to reduce the flood flow of the Yangtze River by 13,000 cubic meters per second, basically eliminating the threat to the Jingjiang Dike.

The Styr River and the Shui River in Su North and Shandong are rivers that have been plagued by disasters for many years. Since 1949, projects with fundamental significance have been started. The New Styr River project has been mostly completed. The Su North Styr River basin, Huaiyin District, which had almost no harvest in the past few years, produced about 800 million jin of grain last year, and this year, although the Styr River had a large flood, no disaster occurred, and the production of Huaiyin District increased to about 20 billion jin, which can be seen clearly.

The levee projects of the Zhujiang and Hanjiang Rivers have been greatly strengthened. The Zhujiang River encountered very large floods in 1950 and 1951, but the main levees did not collapse. The Hanjiang River had a particularly large flood this year, and below Hanchuan, it exceeded the guaranteed water level but did not cause a breach, and its fundamental project is currently under preparation.

The Liaohai River in Northeast and Inner Mongolia, the Daqing River, Ziya River, and Yongding River in Hebei, in addition to generally strengthening the levees, must also implement fundamental projects to solve the problem of water disasters. The Liaohai River has completed the repair of the Erlongshan Reservoir project that was not completed during the Japanese invasion, with a storage capacity of 1.05 billion cubic meters, which, in addition to irrigation benefits, has made 3.13 million mu of land free from water disasters this year. The construction of the Guanting Reservoir project on the Yongding River will officially start in the second half of this year. After completion, it can eliminate the water disasters of the Yongding River, guarantee the safety of the Beijing-Tianjin Railway and Tianjin, and have great irrigation and power generation benefits. The Daqing River has started the construction of the Duliushui River project, and the reservoir project is also under investigation and preparation.

Through the above-mentioned massive projects, taking 1949 as a turning point, the flood control capacity of major rivers has been gradually improving, and thus, the area of the country affected by water disasters has been gradually decreasing: in 1949, the water disaster was over 100 million mu, in 1950, the water disaster was about 60 million mu, and in 1951, the water disaster was 21 million mu. This number shows the great achievements of the Chinese people in overcoming natural disasters and guaranteeing agricultural production.

On the other hand, there is irrigation work. In this aspect, the work is divided into three parts. The first is large-scale irrigation projects, invested or loaned by the government; the second is small-scale irrigation projects, led by the government and organized by the masses; the third is, based on the new situation after land reform, implementing democratic management, advocating economic water use, and increasing the irrigation area of existing projects. The achievements of these three aspects are quite significant. In terms of government-led irrigation projects, over the past two years, the irrigation area has been restored and increased by about 8 million mu. In terms of mass-led small-scale irrigation projects, in 1950, the irrigation area was restored and increased by about 13 million mu, and in 1951, there is no specific statistical figure yet. Regarding the implementation of democratic management and economic water use, last year, Shaanxi Province alone increased the irrigation area by 250,000 mu, and the Chaoyang irrigation district in Northeast increased the irrigation area by 90,000 mu. This year, with the implementation of land reform nationwide, this aspect will definitely have a greater development prospect. The national irrigation projects are focused on the Northwest Region. Over the past two years, the Northwest Region has restored and increased the irrigation area by about 4 million mu, and Xinjiang Province has restored and increased the irrigation area by about 1.5 million mu. The ongoing Yellow River irrigation project for Jingwei is not only irrigating 3.6 million mu of land but also increasing the dry-season flow of the Wei River, making the navigation from Xinxiang to Tianjin smooth, which is a pioneering project to utilize the water resources of the lower reaches of the Yellow River for beneficial projects.

A more significant project in 1951 is the project to control the Huai River, which was determined and instructed by Chairman Mao. This is the first large-scale project for comprehensive river basin development in our country, a project to change the natural landscape of the entire Huai River basin, with the main goal of making the 55 million people and 210,000 square kilometers of land in the Huai River basin free from water disasters forever, and at the same time, increasing the irrigation area of 40 million mu of farmland, improving 1,000 kilometers of waterway transportation, and having a considerable amount of hydropower generation benefits. Now, the first phase of the project has been completed, including 2,100 kilometers of levee projects, 860 kilometers of dredging projects, one reservoir project, 12 lake and lowland flood detention projects, and 92 aqueduct projects, with a total of 200 million cubic meters of earthwork and a large amount of stonework and concrete work. The completion of the first phase of the project has basically guaranteed that the Huai River basin will not suffer from serious water disasters, and the subsequent projects will be to eliminate water disasters and carry out beneficial projects.

The Huai River project is not only a large-scale project but also points out some new directions for the development of water conservancy in our country: the first is the direction of comprehensive planning, in the past, due to the influence of feudal separatism, water control was always done in a piecemeal manner, the control of the Huai River, however, has connected the upper, middle, and lower reaches, first calculated the total account of how much water the Huai River basin has and how much water is used, and then formulated the plan, so it can not only achieve the goal of eliminating water disasters but also consider the needs of beneficial projects.

The second is the direction of water storage, in the past, the methods of water control were not external to preventing water, dividing water, and draining water, in short, treating water as a harmful thing, quickly sending it to the sea, but when it was time for farmland irrigation or waterway transportation, there was no water to use. The Huai River project adopts the policy of water storage as the mainstay, to store the floodwater of July, August, and September this year and supply it for use in April, May, and June next year. So, the water can be adjusted for surplus and deficit, the floodwater will not cause harm during the flood season, and there will be water to use during the dry season. The water storage methods used in the Huai River include two types: one is lake and lowland flood detention projects, which is to control or semi-control the lakes and lowlands along the river, only allowing large floods to enter the lake, because the lake is usually empty, the flood detention capacity can be greatly increased; on the other hand, the fields in the lake, which were originally flooded nine out of ten years, can now guarantee one harvest of wheat. Another type is to build reservoirs in the mountains, which is to choose valleys with large mouths and small outlets in the upper and middle reaches of the river, build dams to intercept the river, and store the entire river water, and then release the water to the lower reaches in a planned manner when it is needed. This year, the newly built reservoirs in Henan are all earth dams, which are very suitable for our current conditions. Drought and flood disasters are common phenomena in our country, and this method should be promoted nationwide.

The third is water and soil conservation work. Many rivers in our country are plagued by disasters because the river water contains too much silt, the soil in the upper reaches is eroded, becoming more barren day by day, and the riverbed in the lower reaches is raised by silt, becoming a river on the ground. Once the levee is breached, not only is the disaster huge, but it is also difficult to restore the old channel. The Yellow River and Yongding River are famous examples. This year, water and soil conservation work has been carried out in the Huai River, planting trees, grass, and building terraces and small reservoirs in the upper reaches of the mountains, intercepting and retaining water, which has been well received by the masses. This is a long-term mass work that does not require much funding but requires planned, organized, and led large-scale development, which will accumulate and produce great benefits.

    人民政协全国委员会第三次会议二十八日会上的专题报告和发言
    编者按：在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议十月二十八日会上作专题报告和发言的有沈钧儒、马叙伦、程潜、陈嘉庚、范永、傅作义、高崇民、张治中、陈绍宽、瓦渣木基、彭泽民、许德珩、陈其尤等十三人，他们的报告和发言如下：
    中央人民政府最高人民法院院长沈钧儒发言
    加强人民司法建设巩固人民民主专政主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    一年来我们国家在抗美援朝的战线上，在国防、政治、经济、文化各项建设上，都获得了辉煌的胜利和伟大的成就，这是值得我们兴奋，值得我们骄傲的！这些巨大成就的获得，主要是由于毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导，发挥了并发挥着中国人民无穷无尽的力量。战胜了敌人，战胜了困难，我们的国家是更加巩固，更加强大了。
    人民法院的工作，在去年全国委员会第二次会议中我曾作了报告，并经大会作了决议。各级人民法院已认真地执行了这个决议。
    在镇压反革命方面，自去年七月政务院与最高人民法院联合发布关于镇压反革命活动的指示后，各地普遍纠正了“宽大无边”。特别在全国大张旗鼓开展镇压反革命运动以后，各级人民法院配合公安、检察等机关，审判了大批反革命罪犯，贯彻镇压与宽大、严肃与谨慎相结合的政策；在中央的正确领导下，依靠广大人民的革命积极性，肃清了大量的反革命分子，进一步巩固了我们的国家。
    关于土地改革中的人民司法工作，在进行与准备土地改革的地区，建立了人民法庭。人民法庭密切结合了清匪、反霸、减租、退押、分田、复查等斗争，惩治了地主阶级的反抗及其他反革命活动，支持了群众的革命行动，使运动得到了有领导有秩序的发展。各地人民法院协助了人民法庭的建立及其干部的调配和训练，并积极支持与指导了人民法庭的工作。经验证明，人民法庭是镇压反动、保障农民权利、提高农民政治觉悟、巩固人民民主专政的有力武器。
    关于清理积案工作，去年全国委员会第二次会议后，我们即在七月间全国第一届司法会议上作了布置，十一月间政务院与最高人民法院又作了关于人民司法机关迅速清理积案的指示，各级人民法院在各级政府的领导与有关部门的协助下，不仅及时清理了大量反革命案件，而且也抓紧处理了大量的普通刑事、民事案件。根据不完全的统计，今年上半年各级人民法院处理了第一审刑事、民事案件八十二万零二百八十五件，实现了人民法院镇压反动、保护人民的重大作用。就目前情况来说，各地案件仍有积压。因之，我们必须努力贯彻执行人民法院暂行组织条例，实行基本上的三级二审制，中央和大行政区直辖市建立区人民法院，各级人民政府加强对人民法院的领导，人民法院在处理案件中继续贯彻群众路线的工作方法；我们必须这样多方面努力，以解决积案的问题。
    司法干部一年来经过了工作上的锻炼与学习，特别是在经过镇压反革命学习以后，政策、业务水平均有提高，机关内部更加纯洁。但现有的干部水平还赶不上工作的需要，还必须继续努力提高。
    目前人民司法工作中另一个主要问题是如何贯彻婚姻法。婚姻法自公布以来，在摧毁封建婚姻制度，建立新的婚姻制度上已发生了巨大的作用。仅据中南区今年上半年不完全的统计，自由结婚的男女即有两万三千六百多对。但是婚姻法的贯彻还是一场严重的反封建斗争。许多地方封建残余思想还在拚命顽抗，同时我们对于婚姻法的宣传不够，对群众反封建婚姻斗争的支持也不够，因而妇女的被杀与被迫自杀事件大量发生。这是当前必须认真解决的迫切问题。政务院为了正确贯彻婚姻法，保护妇女权利，在最近发布了关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示。最高人民法院、最高人民检察署、人民监察委员会、司法部、内务部、法制委员会、全国民主妇女联合会等各有关机关团体，根据政务院这一指示，也都布置了工作，并共同组织了中央检查组分赴各地推动检查。目前各地人民司法机关已在配合有关机关通过审判及其他活动大力宣传贯彻婚姻法，运用人民司法工作的力量，保障妇女的人权与自由，并给予侵害妇女利益的罪犯以必要的惩罚与教育。我们必须把这一个工作做好。
    现在人民法院暂行组织条例、最高人民检察署暂行组织条例与各级地方人民检察署组织通则都已公布施行了。为了贯彻这三个条例，把人民司法建设向前推进一步，根据我们一年来的工作经验，必须首先对下面几个问题给以正确解决。
    第一，对于人民司法工作的认识问题：军队、警察、法庭是人民民主专政的重要武器，人民司法机关的基本任务是巩固人民民主专政。人民司法机关一方面保护人民合法权利，一方面对反动阶级和反动派实行专政。但是在不少干部中，这一思想还不明确，把国家的审判工作（这是政治性最强的工作），当作了一种单纯技术性的工作，不把它当作一个保护民主，实行专政的武器来运用。因之，司法工作未能发挥其应有的作用。这一缺点我们必须克服。
    第二，司法与政治的关系问题：我们的法律是人民意志的集中表现，是国家政策的具体化、条文化。离开政治来谈法律是不对的。法律形成之后，也就有它的独立作用，否认这种作用，也是不对的。但有不少干部对于法律与政治的正确关系认识不清，错误地把法律与政治对立起来，或者把法律摆在政治之上，或者妨碍法律的独立作用，从而在事实上引起司法与政治脱节；不是使司法工作脱离当前的政治中心任务与群众运动，就是忽视司法工作对于人民民主专政的重要意义。我们人民司法工作必须积极地为政治服务，必须与当前的政治中心任务与群众运动相结合。在各种中心任务与运动中，各地领导机关应把司法工作组织进去，注意运用这一武器，使中心工作做得更好。司法机关本身尤应积极主动配合中心任务与运动，充分发挥人民司法的作用。
    第三，司法工作的群众路线问题：人民司法工作，是依靠人民、便利人民、为人民服务的工作，人民司法工作者应该全心全意为人民服务；因而群众路线是人民司法工作的一个基本问题。中央人民政府最近公布的三个条例是贯彻了群众路线这一基本原则的。如基本上的三级二审制、人民陪审、就地调查、就地审判、巡回审判、案件的公开进行与公审、分院的设置和通过审判刑事、民事案件及其他活动，对诉讼人及一般群众进行法纪宣传教育，以及通过人民代表会议、通过群众讨论案件、通过群众检举案件等，均可为这一问题的具体说明。
    第四，双重领导与通力合作的问题：人民司法机关是人民政权的组成部分，与资产阶级的所谓“司法独立”根本不同。固然，人民的审判工作，与一般行政工作不同，有其本身的特点。对于具体案件的审判，应当独立进行。但关于政策方针的具体实施，审判工作的领导检查，我们必须认识中央的集中统一与地方的因地制宜的一致性。在目前阶段，我们不应强调垂直领导，致使司法机关与地方政府的关系不密切，妨碍司法工作的加强。同时，我们的司法工作基础薄弱，经验不多，干部又少。一年来经验证明，司法工作在当前阶段不仅加强当地统一领导有其必要，而且各司法机关及其他有关机关的通力合作亦十分需要。在目前情况下，我们尚不宜于过分强调部门间的精细分工，不应有本位主义的“成绩思想”与“唯职权论”。这些偏向对于通力合作都有妨碍。惟有实行双重领导与通力合作，才能更有利于人民司法工作的建设，才能更好地加强人民革命的法制。
    毛主席在开会词中指出，我们国家当前的中心任务是继续加强抗美援朝，增加生产，厉行节约。人民法院必须围绕这一中心任务，配合公安、检察等有关机关，发挥审判威力，继续深入镇压反革命，惩治不法地主，保卫生产建设，反对贪污浪费，进一步巩固人民民主专政，保证抗美援朝的胜利。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦发言
    团结文化教育工作者学习毛泽东思想主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我在几天会议中，听了毛主席的开会词，中央人民政府周总理和各位首长关于政治、财经、文教的工作报告和中国人民政协全国委员会陈叔通副主席的常务委员会工作报告、中国人民抗美援朝总会彭真副主席的关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告，使我感到非常兴奋，我谨代表中国民主促进会对开会词和这几项报告郑重地表示衷心的拥护。
    同志们：由于伟大的毛泽东思想创造了中华人民共和国，使欺负中国人民的外国帝国主义永远地绝迹于中国了。由于天才的政治家、军事家、思想家、教育家毛泽东主席运用了他的马列主义和中国革命实际结合的正确思想，领导了中国人民，在中华人民共和国成立后两年来，在全国范围内建立了各级人民民主政权；使人民获得了应有的一切权利；使人民有了高度的政治觉悟；使人民有了真正的自由；使人民改善了生活；使人民享受了文化和教育；使人民永远不再受外国帝国主义的欺负；使人民做了自己国家的主人。同志们：这是毛主席和中国共产党领导的人民民主革命伟大胜利的果实，我谨代表中国民主促进会向毛主席和中国共产党致以崇高的敬意和真诚的感谢。
    从中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议以来，我们中华人民共和国正如毛主席所说“在各个战线上都有了辉煌的成就和巨大的进步。”尤其是各民族的亲密团结和西藏的和平解放，实现了中国空前未有的统一；证明了运用毛泽东思想的无往不利。同志们：旧面貌的中国已经迅速地消失，新的人民中国已经确定地成长着和巩固着；人民中国的成长和巩固，更鼓舞着亚洲和全世界被压迫的人民争向我们中国看齐。这是中国人民的光荣。
    两年以前，毛主席领导的中国人民解放军和中国人民打垮了美帝国主义公然支持的国民党反动统治者蒋介石匪帮。使美国国务院无可奈何地在白皮书上承认了不可挽回的失败，但是，它还不惜冒险，甘为戎首；发动了公然侵占我国领土台湾、侵略我唇齿相依的邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的不义战争。它以为新生的人民中国困难很多，乘我不备，可以由朝鲜而长驱直入我国的大陆。感谢我们伟大人民领袖毛主席的英明领导，提高了人民政治觉悟和爱国主义、国际主义的精神，中国人民发动了志愿抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，我们的志愿抗美援朝部队代表着人民的伟大意志，与朝鲜人民军一道，立即驱逐美帝国主义侵略军到三八线附近，打破了美帝国主义的狂妄企图，鼓舞了中国、朝鲜、亚洲乃至全世界爱好和平的人民保卫和平、反对侵略的信心，增加了世界和平民主阵营的力量，从而使中国的国际地位已经如旭日东升空前地提高。“强大的中国！”“强大的中国！”已经不断地在世界人民口里流露出来了。同志们：我们人民志愿军是不可战胜的力量，是我们每个爱国人民的模范；我代表中国民主促进会向英勇的中国人民志愿军致以崇高热烈的敬意。
    同志们：胜利是一定属于我们的了；帝国主义称霸世界的时代永远宣告结束了。但是，我们必须依照毛主席的指示：为了继续坚持这个必要的正义的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军取得抗美援朝的最后胜利；这是中国人民今天的中心任务，我坚决保证：中国民主促进会一定要为贯彻这一重要的任务而努力奋斗。
    周恩来总理号召我们广泛地、有系统地学习毛泽东思想，我们完全拥护。毛泽东思想是中国革命所需要的，是真正正确的，应该成为中国人民的领导思想。推动全国人民学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想武装自己，这是民主党派的任务。中国民主促进会团结的对象主要是文化教育工作者，我们一定要努力学习毛泽东思想，正确使用批评与自我批评的方法，来进行自我教育和自我改造，以提高会员的政治觉悟，从而团结和影响我们所联系的群众，使他们和我们一起学习，提高，进步。重复说一句，我们衷诚地拥护并决心为贯彻执行周总理的加强学习毛泽东思想的号召而奋斗。
    最后让我高呼：
    中国人民志愿军胜利万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    中南军政委员会副主席程潜发言
    决推动广大人民群众增产节约抗美援朝主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们完全同意并衷心拥护毛主席的指示、周总理的政治报告和各首长的报告，我们保证在中南地区的工作中贯彻执行。
    一年来，中南地区也和其他各地区一样，由于中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导，在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命和其他各方面工作上，都获得了显著的成绩。关于抗美援朝运动，中南全区已经深入到每个城市和乡村，和平签名的人数达九千九百余万人，反对美帝国主义武装日本的投票人数达九千八百余万人，认购飞机大炮的捐献代金达九千四百一十五亿多元，慰劳志愿军，除慰劳品外，慰劳金统计到五月底止为三百多亿元。由于抗美援朝，更广泛地提高了人民的政治觉悟，推动了爱国增产运动，加强了人民的团结。关于土地改革，中南全区已经在六千八百余万农业人口的地区，完成了土地改革，共没收、征收了六千九百余万亩田地，分配给将近四千万无地少地的农民。还有五千五百余万农业人口地区，预计在明年内可以基本完成土地改革。已经完成土地改革的地区，正在进行复查。土地改革后的农村，面貌焕然一新，人民政权更加巩固，社会秩序更加安定，生产情绪更加提高。关于镇压反革命，自从放手发动群众，大张旗鼓以来，总计全区反革命分子被处决的约六分之一，被关押的约四分之一，其中大部分编组了劳动队，从事劳动改造，另外还管制了一批，估计已有百分之八十的反革命骨干，遭受了轻重不同的打击。通过镇压反革命运动，不仅扑灭了反革命分子的气焰，尤其教育了广大群众。只有这样，才能划清敌我界限，才能实现人民民主专政。关于剿匪，二年来，中南全区被剿灭的土匪前后达一百零六万余人。特别是广西和湖南西部，在历史上从未肃清的土匪也基本肃清了。僻远地区还有极少数的散匪，必将随土地改革的完成而完全根绝。关于财政经济工作，我们遵照毛主席的指示，大力地争取好转，在中央人民政府领导和中南全区人民一致努力之下，也确已取得了好转。首先是农业生产，今年除了江西平收外，其他各省都是丰收，并且产量都比去年增加。工业也在恢复的基础上获得了相当的发展。其次是组织物资交流，发展合作社，使城乡都出现了繁荣景象，工商业户均有显著增加，尤其农民购买力一般都提高了百分之二十五到三十。其他如民主建政以及文教工作，虽然中南区大部分地区均属新区，进度赶不上老区，但也都获得了一些成绩，打下了初步基础。
    我们决不以这些初步成就而自满，我们当恪遵这次会议毛主席和各位首长的指示，努力继续迈进。
    首先，我们坚决拥护关于抗美援朝工作的决议，我们当集中力量，支援中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的正义战争。我们要决心解放台湾。这里，我要警告残留在台湾的帮凶们：你们应该转向祖国，认识到祖国在中国共产党和毛主席正确领导之下所获得的伟大胜利，认识到伟大的中华人民共和国已经是世界最强大的国家，你们就应该争取立功赎罪，应该与台湾人民团结在一起，坚决反对美帝国主义狂妄侵略，反对蒋介石匪帮出卖祖国，而准备回到祖国的怀抱中来。假如你们不这样做，你们将会受到人民的惩罚。
    我们一定在明年内完成中南全区的土地改革，并且在土地改革完成的地区，认真进行复查。决不让封建势力的残余发酵。我们一定认真侦缉逃亡和隐蔽的反革命分子，做到除恶务尽，也要切实做好劳动改造大批罪犯的艰巨工作。我们遵守毛主席的指示，决不放松对于反革命残余的警惕。
    毛主席指示增加生产厉行节约，继续支援中国人民志愿军，是中国人民今天的中心任务。我们当遵照这个指示，并结合周总理和陈副总理的报告，提请中南军政委员会即将召集的会议，当作当前重要任务加以研讨，一定要大力推动，形成群众性的运动，我们保证并相信将获得伟大成效。
    毛主席再三再四指示我们要团结一切可能团结的力量，这是十分重要的。我们一致为一年来的伟大的胜利而欢欣鼓舞，我们更应该深切地体认到只有在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导之下，贯彻执行人民政协共同纲领，发挥人民民主专政的优越性，才可能团结全国人民，全国人民才可能充分发挥其无穷尽的力量，只有在这样的基础之上，才可能获得这样伟大而光辉的胜利。我们一致响应周总理的号召，用马克思列宁主义与中国革命的实践相结合的毛泽东思想武装起来，我们要推动广大人民群众，有系统地认真地学习毛泽东选集来加强全中国人民的大团结，我们一致团结在中国共产党和毛主席旗帜之下，为保卫祖国、建设祖国、保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    人民政协全国委员会委员陈嘉庚发言
    爱国华侨永远不会向帝国主义低头主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我此次出席人民政协全国委员会第三次会议，听到了毛主席的开会词，周总理的政治报告，抗美援朝总会彭真副主席的报告，以及会务，财经，文教各种报告，感到非常兴奋！我谨代表华侨，表示竭诚拥护毛主席的号召！
    美帝国主义看到我们中国人民站立起来了，害怕我们强大，仇视我们强大，因而侵占我们的台湾，进攻我们邻邦朝鲜，轰炸我们的东北，严重地威胁我们国家的安全，因此激起我们全国人民的义愤，踊跃地抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    大家都知道，美帝国主义这次进攻朝鲜是走着以前日本帝国主义的旧路，主要目的在于进攻我国，所以我们抗美援朝意义的重大，不亚于当年的抗日战争。
    美帝国主义还破坏波茨坦公告等国际协约，独占日本，武装日本，积极准备世界第三次大战，实在是全世界人类的公敌。试看历史，凡背道蔑理，违反信义，结果必然失败。德日意法西斯以及蒋匪帮可耻的结局，就是最明显的例证。美帝国主义也决不能例外。毛主席说得很对，最后胜利必然属于我们！
    华侨一向期望祖国独立、自由、民主、强盛。现在这个希望完全成为事实了。就是因为如此，华侨已经不是所谓“海外孤儿”，而已经有了一个伟大的慈母，这就是伟大的中华人民共和国！被迫害归国的侨胞，受到了祖国人民政府的关心照顾，这是以前所没有的。只有毛主席和中国共产党领导的中华人民共和国的政府，才能够如此！
    国外一千多万的华侨，在抗日战争的时候，曾热烈地支持祖国的抗战。这是大家都知道的。现在，华侨所居留的地方，很多处在美帝国主义直接或间接的奴役之下。美帝国主义因为敌视我国，也就敌视我们爱国华侨；同时加上了蒋匪帮的特务走狗勾结帝国主义，反动政权千方百计地陷害爱国华侨，致使华侨处境非常困难。但是我可以告诉各位：广大的华侨的爱国心，是永远不会向帝国主义低头的；爱国侨胞的心，和国内同胞的心，是永远结合在一起的。
    抗美援朝铁道大队指导员范永发言
    志愿援朝铁路员工决保证前线物资供应主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我代表志愿援朝铁路运输人员说几句话。
    我们中国铁路员工，能够参加志愿援朝的战斗行列，这是中国铁路员工的光荣，也是中国人民的光荣。
    朝鲜的交通运输线，是朝鲜战场上最紧张战线的一部分。美国强盗在前线真刀真枪打不过我们，它就在我们的运输线上打主意。仗着他们的飞机多，拚命地轰炸我们的交通运输线。今年七月间，朝鲜又遇上了几十年来没有过的大洪水，把所有的铁路便桥都冲垮了，美国强盗就趁这个机会，更加疯狂地轰炸我们的铁路线，成千成百的飞机，白天黑夜不停地轮番轰炸，把我们的铁路炸得遍体鳞伤。他们设想：截断了我们的交通运输线，东西运不上去，我们前线的军队就得饿着肚子抱着空枪和他们打仗，这样，他们就以为可能压服我们和朝鲜人民。他们大吹大擂地夸耀他们轰炸的成绩，公开宣布他们从梦里看到的“我们铁路不通了”。但是事实上，他们的算盘完全打错了。正如毛主席所说的：“他们的想法是狂妄的，是徒然的，是不可能达到目的的”。我们的前线部队居然是愈来愈加兵精粮足，愈战愈强，愈来愈多地成千成万地消灭美国强盗。
    不错，敌人的轰炸是曾经给我们增加了很多的困难，今后还会增加。但是我们援朝铁路员工和铁道部队从来没有在任何困难情况下低过头。当着困难摆在我们面前的时候，我们想起了毛主席的指示，我们就生长了力量；听到了祖国建设的成就和朝鲜前线的胜利，就感到了兴奋；看到了朝鲜人民对我们像一家人一样的热爱，和朝鲜铁路员工英勇顽强的斗争精神就增加了信心。我们和朝鲜铁路员工团结得像亲兄弟一般，一起战斗，一起学习。我们在困难中学会了对付敌人的“定时炸弹”、“子母炸弹”、“照明弹”……等特殊本领；也学会了在敌机轰炸扫射及海岸炮轰击下抢修线路、桥梁和架电线的本领。工作效率提高了几倍到十几倍，就是说，把修复的速度提高了几倍以至十几倍。比如，过去我们修复一处被炸断的铁路，填坑铺轨，往往需要一天，现在一点半钟就可以修好，我们还学会了在敌机轰炸和扫射之下开火车的本领，在我们员工当中出现了“闯照明弹”“钻海岸炮”的能手；我们也学会了和我们的防空部队紧密地配合对敌人的轰炸作坚决的斗争。因为我们坚持了斗争，坚持了学习，我们的铁路出乎敌人意料之外，不是“不通”或者“少通”，恰恰是常通和多通了。物资的供应不是运不上去，恰恰是运上去的更多了。比如，十月份铁路虽然遭受了严重的轰炸，但是我们在半个月里的运输量几乎等于过去一个月的运输量。
    这些事实说明了什么呢？说明了在毛泽东时代的工人和人民面前，没有什么不可以克服的困难。照着毛主席指示的方向前进，没有任何力量能够挡住我们前进的道路。同时证明了另外一条真理，就是对付帝国主义强盗们，只能坚决，不能含糊，如果你要含糊，它就越来越凶；你要是坚决地揍它，它就会夹着尾巴滚蛋。
    这次我们回国参加国庆节观礼，看到了祖国在进行抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动后，全国人民的觉悟更加提高，团结更加巩固，祖国的建设有了极大的进步，到处出现了兴旺的气象。这次我们列席政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议，听到了毛主席的开会词和周总理、陈叔通副主席、彭真副主席、陈副总理、郭副总理的报告。所有这些看到和听到的，都使我们感到兴奋，感到我们后边的力量，是无穷无尽的，我们浑身都长了劲。同时也感到我们的工作还有很多缺点。这次回到朝鲜后，一定要把祖国的兴旺气象，毛主席和各位首长的指示传达到全体志愿援朝铁路员工和铁道部队中去。我们一定和朝鲜铁路员工以及我们的战斗部队更加亲密地团结在一起，坚持战斗，响应毛主席的继续加强抗美援朝、增加生产厉行节约的号召，继续加强反对敌机轰炸的斗争。在增产方面，要做到继续缩短铁路修复的时间，增加列车的牵引吨数，延长机车的运行里程，提高列车的旅行速度。在节约方面，要做到节省抢修材料与检修材料，节省机车燃料和油脂，节省车皮的使用。我们将用这些办法，更加发挥铁路的运输效率，来回答毛主席和祖国人民的热望。保证前线的物资供应，使朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军能够更多地消灭美国侵略者，争取抗美援朝战争的胜利结束。
    我们可爱的祖国中华人民共和国万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    中央人民政府水利部部长傅作义发言
    水利事业的成就是毛主席思想的胜利主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在这次会议中，听了毛主席的开会词和周总理、陈副总理、郭副总理、彭真副主席关于国家情况各方面的报告，对这些报告，我完全拥护。在这些报告中可以看出：人民革命战争的胜利，人民民主制度的建立，在我国，在世界，引起何等伟大深刻的变化。短短两年的时间，经过土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝三大运动的深入展开，我们已经真正成为独立富强的国家，成为维护亚洲和世界和平的重要支柱，尤其是在抗美援朝的前线上，已经给了美帝国主义为首的侵略集团以严重的打击。这一切胜利在国内经济生活上的表现，则是各种生产事业的飞速的发展。今后我们一定根据毛主席的指示，把增加生产，厉行节约，支援中国人民志愿军，当作一切工作的中心，以取得更大的胜利。现在我愿意就两年来我国水利事业的发展谈一点感想，对毛主席和其他领导同志的报告，来做个印证。
    水利事业包括防止水害，发展水利两方面的目标。目前的工作，根据国家建设的总的方针，首先是配合农业生产的恢复和发展，着重解决防洪和灌溉两个问题。
    过去我国水灾情况的严重，大家是熟习的。举几个突出的例子来说，一九三一年淮河长江两河，淹地就在一亿五千万亩以上，一九四九年全国淹地亦在一亿亩以上。可是两年以来，全国河道的防御情况，已经发生根本的变化了。过去对安全无保证的，现在有了适当的保证，过去保证很低的，现在有了较高的保证。
    因为水利事业是广大群众的迫切需要，一九五零年全国用在水利事业方面的经费，相当国民党反动统治时期水利经费最多一年的十八倍，一九五一年相当四十二倍。两年来全国动员参加水利工程的民工，先后共达一千零三十七万人，还有人民解放军三十二万人协助工作，共做工五亿余工日。所做大小建筑物总共一万一千二百八十三座。所做土工总量，总共九亿五千九百万立方公尺，若筑成高宽各一公尺的长堤，可以围绕地球赤道二十四周。土工效率也有显著提高，过去每人每天做一公方半土，今年黄河平原省平均效率达到四公方以上。通过这样巨大的工程，全国主要河道四万二千公里的堤防，都进行了加高培厚和整险护岸的工程，部分河流并且开始进行治本工程。
    举几个主要的例子来说，黄河在解放以前，只要陕州流量在一万秒立方公尺以上，决口的机会就占百分之七十五，解放以后，一九四九年已经保证陕州流量一万六千五百秒立方公尺不生溃决，一九五零年可以保证一万七千秒立方公尺不生溃决，今年在平原省临黄堤和北金堤之间，做了一项滞洪工程，可以保证陕州流量二万三千秒立方公尺时，不致决口改道。在治本的工程实施以前，黄河流域人民的安全，已经得到初步保障。
    长江一九三一年淹地八千九百多万亩，一九四九年淹地也在两千万亩以上。其最危险的一段，是湖北省的荆江大堤（即从沙市到城陵矶长江北岸的堤防），长江在这一段，因为河槽狭窄不能容泄较大的洪水，威胁着三百万人口、八百万亩土地的安全。国民党反动统治期间长期失治，河底淤高，形势更加危急，而治本的工程不是短期所可着手，为了预防万一发生异常洪水，造成巨大灾害，今年已经开始在南岸太平口虎渡河以东，藕池口以北地区，修筑临时分洪工程，估计可以减少长江的洪水流量一万三千秒立方公尺，基本解除荆江大堤所受的威胁。
    苏北和山东的沂河、沭河，都是连年成灾的河流，从一九四九年就已开始进行带有治本性质的工程。新沂河工程，现已大部完成。苏北沂河流域的淮阴专区，过去几年几乎没有收成，去年产粮约八亿斤，今年沂河的洪水很大，未生灾害，淮阴专区的产量增加到二十亿斤左右，可以看出明显的效益。
    珠江和汉水的堤防工程，都已大为加强。珠江一九五零年和一九五一年都遭遇很大的洪水，主要堤围未生溃决。汉水今年洪水特大，汉川以下，超过保证水位，亦未决口成灾，其治本工程正在进行准备工作。
    东北和内蒙的辽河，河北的大清河、子牙河、永定河，除一般加强堤防以外，都必须进行治本工程才能解决水灾的问题，辽河已经修理完成日寇侵略时期没有完成的二龙山水库工程，蓄水十亿五千万立方公尺，除去灌溉利益以外，今年已使三百一十三万亩土地免受水灾，其支流太子河的水库明年就要动工。永定河官厅水库工程今年下半年正式开工，完成以后可以免除永定河的水患，保障京津路和天津的安全，并有很大的灌溉和发电的效益。大清河除去已经开始进行独流入海减河工程以外，水库工程也在查勘准备之中。
    通过以上这些巨大的工程，拿一九四九年当做一个转折点，各主要河流防御洪水的能力都在逐步提高，因之，全国遭受水灾的面积是在逐步缩小：一九四九年的水灾是一亿亩以上，一九五零年的水灾是六千万亩左右，一九五一年的水灾是二千一百万亩，这个数目可以说明全国人民克服自然灾害，保障农业生产伟大成就的第一方面。
    另一方面，是灌溉工作，在这一方面的工作，是分以下三个方面进行的。其一是大型灌溉工程，由政府投资或贷款举办；其二是小型灌溉工程，由政府领导群众举办；其三是根据土地改革以后的新的情况，实行民主管理，讲求经济用水，以增加现有工程的灌溉面积。这三方面的成绩都是相当巨大的。在政府举办的灌溉工程方面，两年以来恢复并增加灌溉面积约八百万亩，在群众举办的小型灌溉工程方面，一九五零年恢复并增加灌溉面积约一千三百万亩，一九五一年还没有具体的统计数字。关于实行民主管理和经济用水，去年陕西一省，就增加灌溉面积二十五万亩，东北查哈阳一个灌溉区，就增加灌溉面积九万亩。今年全国实行土地改革，这一方面必然有更大发展的前途。全国灌溉工程是以西北为重点，两年来西北一区恢复并增加灌溉面积约四百万亩，新疆一省恢复并增加灌溉面积约一百五十万亩，正在进行的引黄灌溉济卫工程，除去灌溉土地三十六万亩外，并可增加卫河的枯水流量，使新乡到天津航运畅通，这是利用黄河下游水源举办兴利工程的创举。
    一九五一年所举办的一个更为巨大的工程，就是毛主席所确定所指示的根治淮河的工程。这是我国所举办的第一个多目标的流域开发的工程，这是一个改变整个淮河流域自然面貌的工程，它的主要的目标是使淮河流域五千五百万人民，二十一万平方公里的土地，永绝水患，同时还可增加四千万亩的农田灌溉，改善一千公里的航道交通，并有相当数量水力发电的利益。现在它的第一期工程已经完成了，这第一期工程就包括二千一百公里的堤防工程，八百六十公里的疏浚工程，一处水库工程，十二处湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，九十二座的涵闸工程，共做两亿立方公尺的土工，和数量很大的石工和混凝土工。第一期工程的完成，就已经基本上保证了淮河流域，不再发生严重水患，此后的工程则是要根绝水患，并进行兴利的工程。
    治淮工程不但是一个规模巨大的工程，同时给我国水利事业的发展，指出一些新的方向：第一个是通盘规划的方向，过去治水因为受封建割据的影响，总是枝枝节节的治理，淮河的治理，则是把上中下游打通了，先把淮河流域有多少水，用多少水，算了一篇总帐，然后才规定计划，所以不但可达到根绝水患的目的，同时兼顾了兴利的需要。
    第二个是蓄水的方向，过去治水的方法，不外是防水、分水、泄水，总之是把水当做有害的东西，赶快送到海里，等农田灌溉或航道交通用水的时候，却又无水可用，治淮工程是采取了以蓄水为主的方针，要把今年七八九月的洪水储蓄起来，供给明年四五六月使用。所以对水就可调剂盈虚，汛期洪水既不为害，干旱季节也有水可用。在淮河上所用的蓄水的方法，一种是湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，就是把沿河的湖泊洼地，做上控制或半控制工程，只等较大洪水才放水入湖，因为湖内常空，蓄洪的容量可以大大提高；另一面，湖里的田地，原来十年九淹，现在也可保证一季麦收。另一种是在山地修筑水库，就是在河流的上中游，选择肚子大出口小的山谷，修筑拦河坝，把河水整个拦蓄起来，等下游用水的时候，再有计划地把水放了下来。今年在河南新修的水库，因为是土坝，很适合我们目前的条件，旱涝失调是我国普遍的现象，这办法应该在全国普遍推广。
    第三个是水土保持工作。我国许多河流成灾的原因是河水的泥沙过多，上游土壤被冲刷，一天比一天贫瘠，下游河道被泥沙淤高，变成了地上河，一旦破堤决口，不但灾害巨大，而且不易恢复旧道，黄河和永定河是著名的例证。今年在淮河试办水土保持工作，在上游山区种树、种草、修筑梯田及小型谷坊塘坝，截水留淤，极受群众的欢迎。这是群众性的长期工作，不需要很多经费，而需要有计划有组织有领导地大规模地发展，累积起来就会发生很大效益。
    在治淮工程中另一个具有重大影响的工程，就是控制淮河中游洪水的润河集分水闸工程，它包括拦河坝、固定河槽、拦河闸和进湖闸，共有四十五公尺的闸门七孔，二十一公尺的闸门五孔，十五公尺的闸门三孔，都是用油压力开关，共需物料二十五万公吨，像这样巨大的工程，在过去反动统治时代，都认为离开帝国主义国家的物料，是不可能完成的。可是我们完全依靠自己技术和工业生产，在三个月内，就全部完成了它。这一个工程的胜利完成，对我们全体干部群众，是一个伟大的爱国主义的教育，使我们完全摆脱了对帝国主义国家的依赖思想，建立起独立创造坚定不移的信心。
    从中华人民共和国成立到现在不过两年的时间，为什么我们能够获得这样巨大的成就呢，这正如毛主席所说，是因为“我们的人民民主专政的制度，较之资本主义国家的政治制度具有极大的优越性。”——是因为土地改革，打垮了封建统治阶级的把持操纵，通盘规划的治水思想，才有彻底实现的政治基础和社会基础，是因为土地改革，启发出翻身农民兴修水利增加生产的巨大的积极性，才有可能组织起几百万人的劳动大军，以从事这样巨大的工程，是因为镇压反革命、抗美援朝、爱国增产运动，推动起广泛的竞赛的热潮，土工效率才获得空前的提高，是因为工农联盟伟大的思想的领导，才解决了工程所需要的物资生产上的许多困难，是因为广大的技术人员，进行着自我教育和自我改造，理论与实践结合，技术与群众结合，技术才能获得进步。这一切都是毛主席思想的伟大胜利，而贯彻毛主席的领导思想，则是依靠了毛主席所教导的中国共产党和广大干部的努力。是他们不计名位、不问甘苦、不避艰险，在田里、地里、泥里、水里，和群众一起工作、一起斗争，在肉中做筋，在铁里做钢，做了多少默默无闻的工作，才有这样赫赫显著的成绩。人民感激他们，人民更感激毛主席。在毛泽东思想的光辉里，我们看见了新中国无限光明无限美好的远景，也看见水利事业的光明美好的远景。在毛主席的领导下，全国人民一定能够逐步掌握全国各大江河可能掌握的几千亿立方公尺洪水，让它驯顺地为人民服务。让它永不为害，让它安详地、及时地流进广大农民的棉田、稻田、谷田、麦田，以滋养培育丰盈的农作物；让它成为几十条巨大的运河，以发展城乡物资的交流；让它变成千百万基罗瓦特的电力，走进农场、走进工厂，做为生产的动力，并且发出光明，在城市农村每一家的玻璃窗下，照耀着人们的欢乐的生活。这不是幻想，这是在苏联所已经实现了，而现在正由毛主席领导着我们实现的现实。让我们在毛主席的旗帜下，前进，前进！
    东北人民政府副主席高崇民发言
    努力生产厉行节约进一步加强国防建设主席、副主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意主席的指示和中央各首长的报告，这些报告总结了一年来中国人民在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，努力奋斗的辉煌成就，同时确定了今后全国人民的努力方向和具体任务，东北人民将和全国人民一道，为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    东北人民和全国人民一样，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，一年来在巩固国防、发展经济及其他工作中，做了一些工作。东北是处在抗美援朝的后方，东北人民的抗美援朝保家卫国运动是积极的、热烈的，一年来贡献了巨大的人力物力支援前线。捐献飞机大炮已完成四千余亿的认捐数字，现已交款一千三百余亿。通过抗美援朝运动，广泛深入地进行了爱国主义和国际主义的教育，人民的觉悟提高了，推动了一切工作的前进。伟大的抗美援朝运动，已成为推动各项工作的动力，社会生活的各方面出现了新的气象。
    东北在抗美援朝爱国运动的基础上，紧紧地依靠着工人阶级和全体劳动人民，在工厂矿山和广大农村，热烈地开展了爱国增产和丰产运动。国营和公营厂矿从今年下半年起，在完成原订计划基础上，开展了增产节约五百万吨粮食运动，工人职员与技术人员以空前的劳动积极性，发挥了工业的潜在力量，创造了伟大的成绩。初步统计，各方面的增产节约可以达到一千万吨。东北国、公营工业生产如以一九四九年为基数，今年将上升到二百八十七点七，如与一九五零年相比，今年将达到一百三十一。农业生产如亦以一九四九年为基数，今年将上升到一百九十点一，如与一九五零年相比，今年将达到一百零八点二。这是在农村实行土地改革之后，由于政府大力提倡和扶持合作互助，实行了各种奖励政策，改良和提高农业技术（在提高农业技术方面我们注意了农具和耕地方法的改革，注意了公营农场的示范作用，农场耕地现占百分之一）和在城市中特别在工矿企业中实行了民主改革，改进了生产的经营管理，改善了工人生活，发动了工人的积极性的结果。随着工农业生产的发展，国家商业和合作社也有很大发展，国营贸易采购总值今年计划为一九四九年的百分之三百八十八，为一九五零年的百分之一百六十点五；推销总值今年计划为一九四九年的百分之三百一十五点五，为一九五零年的百分之一百五十四点五。基层合作社数今年计划为一九四九年的百分之三百一十七，今年合作社社员将达到东北城乡人口总数的百分之四十六点四。私营工商业也得到了发展。
    随着工农业生产的恢复和发展，人民生活日渐提高，中农已成为农村中的多数。如果从农民购买力提高的趋势来看，是生产资料需要的比重逐年增加，这说明农民积极要求扩大再生产。因此，满足农民对于生产资料和生活资料的需要，提高农业生产，从而充分供应工业原料，发展工业生产，这是从经济上达到城乡互助、巩固工农联盟的基本问题。
    东北人民的文化要求亦日益增长，目前东北共有小学生五百一十七万余人，中学生十七万四千余人，大学生二万六千余人，受补习教育的职工三十三万八千人，经常参加学习的农民约有二百二十七万人。出版事业也有巨大的发展。大量培养和训练干部的工作正在进行。
    工农业生产的发展，文化教育事业的发展，改变了人民的生活面貌，人民逐渐走向富裕的、有文化的生活了。
    一年来东北人民民主建设也有进步，各级人民代表会议已成为经常制度，经过人民代表会议，加强了各民族的、各民主阶级的团结，密切了政府和人民群众的联系，推动了各级人民政府的工作，提高了人民的积极性。大张旗鼓镇压反革命，保卫了人民的利益，保障了经济建设和国防建设，巩固了抗美援朝的后方。人民民主专政进一步加强和巩固了。
    但是，我们的工作还有很多不够的地方，甚至还有许多缺点和错误需要改正，已经作了的还需要提高一步。因此，东北人民决不能满足已有的成就。今后我们一定要本着毛主席和中央各首长的指示，同全国人民一道，加倍努力。为了争取抗美援朝的最后胜利，东北人民的任务，就是要努力加强国防建设，继续深入普及抗美援朝爱国主义运动，加强人民的爱国主义和国际主义的教育，大力支援前线。要更进一步地在已有的基础上加紧生产，厉行节约，使抗美援朝有雄厚的物质基础，保障经济建设特别是工业建设的进一步发展。要发展人民文化教育事业，大量培养训练干部。要继续提高人民代表会议，彻底肃清一切反革命分子，巩固人民民主专政。我们深信，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，今后东北人民一定会和全国各地区一样获得更大的成就。
    西北军政委员会副主席张治中发言
    在毛主席领导下努力建设祖国的西北区主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    从去年六月第二次会议到现在，这一年多的时间，我们的国家又获得无比辉煌的成就。这主要是开展了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革三大运动，全国人民动员起来了，美帝国主义对于朝鲜和我国的侵略，遭到了严重的打击，全国已有三亿多农业人口地区完成了土地改革，土匪、特务分子的捣乱被严厉镇压，使我国内部更加巩固，我们已经有力量发展工业生产和进行根治淮河这样的巨大的建设工作，这是中国人民的伟大的胜利。我们国家的力量不断增长着，现在全世界谁也不能不承认我们是头等强国了，东方的和世界的和平更加有保障了，我们的人民都为祖国的伟大成就而欢呼，为祖国的光辉灿烂的前途而欢呼，这是极其自然的。
    我在这里要特别加以说明的，是随着全国工作的发展，我国西北地区的面貌也大大改变了。我们祖国的伟大而广阔的西北地区于一九四九年底获得全部解放。一九五零年我们进行了极为繁重的工作，包括完成接管，安定地方，剿除股匪，建立各级人民政府，统一财政经济工作，调整工商业，恢复生产，促进民族团结等等。所有这些工作，都是给以后开展各项社会改革和建设工作准备了条件。我们是稳步地度过了这最困难的一年。今年以来，我们是大大前进了，这主要的是因为我们用最大的力量去发展了群众运动。目前，抗美援朝运动，已经由普及逐渐走向深入，今年“五、一”节前后，全西北有一千七百万人民参加爱国大示威与签名拥护缔结和平公约，投票反对武装日本，随即开展了推行爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮和优抚军属烈属的热潮，开展了爱国主义生产运动。去冬今春，在七百多万农业人口地区完成土地改革，一千万农业人口地区进行减租，经过土地改革，农民成了土地的主人，也就成了国家的主人。最近几月来，我们又在工厂、矿山、企业内部进行民主改革，清除了残余封建势力，工人们说：“过去是晴了半边天，现在全晴了。”经过这个运动，大大提高了工人群众作为国家领导阶级的政治自觉性。我们大张旗鼓地严厉镇压继续进行破坏活动的土匪、特务、反革命分子，保卫人民利益，巩固了各地革命秩序。在进行这些工作中，加强了各族、各界人民的大团结，特别是正确地执行了民族政策，各族人民间由于有了真正的平等，团结友爱的精神确实增长起来。今天的西北，已经是一个空前团结和空前进步的西北了。
    我们为什么能够达到这样团结和这样进步呢？我们为什么能够这样迅速地获得这样伟大的成就呢？两年来的事实，使我们深深体验到，最根本的原因，就是由于我们的国家是我国工人阶级的政党中国共产党领导的，是中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席领导的，是以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家。人民政府的工作，都是以最大多数人民的利益作为
    一切行动、设施的基础。而我们国家的根本制度，就是人民代表会议和人民代表大会的制度，经过这种制度，去贯彻人民政府的政策、法令和集中人民的意见。人民政府的工作干部在进行各种工作时，都是为了人民群众，而又依靠人民群众，不怕麻烦地将政策、办法向群众讲清楚，倾听群众的意见，启发群众的积极性，领导群众起来去做，把事情办好，并通过各种具体工作，把群众的思想觉悟提高
    一步，随即巩固一步。虽然有些工作也有缺点，有些干部的思想作风也有毛病，但这只是部分的现象，是发展中的缺点，一经发现，即认真开展批评与自我批评，加以改正，就全体看，各地人民政府的工作，都是不断提高、不断进步的。应当认清：广大人民群众政治觉悟性的增长，爱国主义思想的高涨，就是我们国家力量不断增长的泉源，是推动我们社会向前发展的伟大的动力。而中国共产党和毛主席的领导，则是指引我们新中国不断地由胜利走向胜利的伟大的舵师。
    目前我们在西北地区的工作任务，就是继续用最大力量发展群众运动，动员西北各族、各界人民与全国人民一起，加强抗美援朝、巩固国防的斗争，坚决打败美帝国主义的侵略；继续肃清残余反革命势力，进行防奸细防特务教育，建立人民的治安保卫组织；在一千四百万农业人口地区，按照已定计划完成土地改革，和在一部分今年尚不能进行土地改革地区开展减租运动；在城市和矿区，继续开展工厂、矿山、企业内部的民主改革运动；厉行精简节约，继续开展爱国主义生产运动，做好经济工作，以及继续加强各族、各界人民的大团结。做好这些工作，就给今后西北地区的建设，打下了牢固的根基。
    在这以后，我们就要进入全面建设的时期了。我们相信在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们一定能够胜利地完成上述任务。我们西北地区各项建设事业的进展，也将不是很慢而是相当地快的。我们一定能够把我们伟大祖国的西北部，建设成为一个经济繁荣文化昌盛的地区，与全国人民一起，为建设新民主主义的新中国并争取社会主义的前途而奋斗。
    福建省人民政府副主席陈绍宽发言
    决遵照毛主席指示进一步加强抗美援朝主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    绍宽奉召列席中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议和参加这次国庆观礼，觉得非常光荣。在大会上听到毛主席的开会词，周总理的政治报告及各位首长的报告，我感觉无比的兴奋。这些正确的指示、伟大的政策、伟大的计划和伟大的成就，我热烈和诚恳地拥护。
    中华人民共和国建立才两周年，我们全国就有这样突飞猛晋的伟大成就，实在是举国人民所欢喜的。我深深感到这样伟大的成就，惟有毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的英明正确领导才会得到。全国人民的大团结做得这样好，新民主主义社会刚开始就有这样大成就，将来进到社会主义社会而共产主义社会，其成就更是无止境的。中国前途实在是光芒万丈，我们应该感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党。
    我是刚从福建来的，我现在报告一些福建的情况。福建全省的解放还不到两年，省人民政府成立才二十六个月，以前在反动派统治的时候是灾难深重，人民生活悲惨，加以土匪为患，特务作恶，社会不得安宁。解放之后，革命秩序普遍建立起来，人民痛苦解除，民主建政也已普遍做到了，有的地方已经是人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权。
    反动派遗留下来的残破社会事业，已经先后修建起来，公路桥梁重新修造，交通便利，运输力量增强。土匪惯匪为患数十年，经驻省的人民解放军连同地方武装民兵等努力剿除，现已全部肃清了。解放以来福建同全国各地一样，货币不膨胀，物价甚稳定，尤以对外贸易出超，这是多年未曾有的事情。因为以前都是入超，自从土产城乡内外交流以来起，经济更是日见繁荣。新民主主义教育普遍推行，业余学校及补习班等等也大量扩展。南方向多疫病，年来政府注重公共卫生及预防注射，普种牛痘，今年已经做到没有疫症了。人民与政府团结一致，社会安宁，人心安定，人民安居乐业，面貌为之一新。
    自三大运动推行之后，各方面工作更见进展。福建因解放较迟，当时一部分地区又有特殊情况，因此土地改革工作开始稍见慢些，但土地改革开始之后，甚见顺利，现大部分已经完成，再过四五个星期就可以全部完成。农村生产力既经解放，农民生产情绪高涨，因此本年虽遭春间的水患，秋间的旱灾，农民都能够按照政府指示号召和领导，努力救灾增产，结果早稻和晚稻都告丰收。
    解放之初，土匪特务势颇猖獗，甚至杀害干部，焚烧仓库，破坏交通，杀害人民和摧毁人民利益，经海陆分剿，才把土匪肃清。镇压反革命实施之后，土匪特务反革命分子的气焰即抑下去，人民的正气伸上来，人心大快，社会更见安宁。福建与台湾仅一水之隔，不过一百几十海里，处在海防最前线，美帝国主义强盗和反动派残余力量不独妄图封锁海口，并且常常暗派海匪偷行登陆等等，因此驻省的人民解放军特须随时严防备战，而解放军十分努力和勇敢，纪律优良，军民团结一致，获得人民之支援。农民政治觉悟提高了，民兵防守工作也甚为得力。
    抗美援朝运动自去年推行以来，福建同全国各地一样获到很大效果。福建本来是帝国主义者及教会势力很大并且是很普遍的地方，我们对于揭穿美帝国主义是一只纸老虎的宣传工作，做得特多，很快地就把一般群众恐美、亲美、崇美的心理，变为鄙视、仇视和蔑视态度。嗣后以人民志愿军在朝鲜作战不断的胜利，更使人民胜利信心大大增强。对于中央号召参加青年干部军校，都热烈和踊跃地响应。工人、农民、妇女、青年以及其他各界和宗教界等，都大大地发扬爱国主义与国际主义精神。对于签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约、投票反对美帝国主义武装日本的各种运动，也都热烈参加。缴税交粮既快速又足额，或集体交税，或用锣鼓列队送粮。至于订立爱国公约，增加生产、捐献飞机大炮坦克之运动，更是风行到全省各角落。福建人口有一千二百万，工商业还没有大发达，原来认捐飞机四十架，（现在已经超额至五十几架），还有大炮坦克也是随后自动增加的。对于优抚烈属军属工作，也是不断地加强推行。总之抗美援朝运动已经做到相当普遍深入和经常化，要使人人都懂得现在帝国主义者侵略还没有消灭，朝鲜停战谈判敌方也还没有诚意，我们惟有尽量增产节约，踊跃捐献，支援人民志愿军和加强国防力量，争取抗美胜利，保卫祖国安全，保卫世界和平。
    今天因为时间关系，只能简单报告。绍宽这回来到北京列席会议，学习到不少，今后回去福建，本着大会精神，传达给福建人民，使对中央更加拥护，我更当竭尽能力帮同张鼎丞主席遵照毛主席的指示，更进一步加强抗美援朝运动和推行国家政策法令，全心全意为人民服务。我乘此机会敬祝大会胜利成功，各位身体健康。
    毛主席身体健康！
    彝族代表瓦渣木基发言
    彝族人民感谢毛主席给予光明和幸福主席、诸位委员、诸位同志：
    首先，我代表西昌专区的各族人民，对于毛主席的开会词，周总理的政治报告，和全国委员会陈叔通副主席、中国人民抗美援朝总会彭真副主席的工作报告，以及大会关于抗美援朝工作的决议，表示完全同意和坚决拥护。
    西昌专区有十多个民族，其中彝族的人口最多，大约有一百几十万人。去年十二月，西昌专区在上级人民政府的领导和中央民族访问团刘格平团长的帮助下，已成立民族民主联合政府。今年四月，昭觉县已成立民族区域自治政府。到目前，西昌专区各级行政单位已成立民族民主联合政府的，有四个县、四个区、十八个乡；已成立民族区域自治政府的，有一个县、四个区、七个乡。各族人民都有自己的代表参加了各界人民代表会议，做了政府委员。各级人民政府并尽量吸收少数民族干部，据不完全统计，到目前为止，区以上的干部共有一百三十余人，内副专员二人，县长副县长十三人，此外还有许多干部担任区长和乡长。一年多来培养出来的彝、藏、黎苏、苗、亚拉等族干部共有五百三十八名。自从民族民主的政权建立之后，各族人民都认为有了自己的政府，积极性大大提高，因而推进了各项工作。
    表现在剿匪方面，解放以来，计参加搜捕土匪的各族支头领头的共有五十一个，捕获排级以上的土匪特务在三百三十多名，会理有一个彝民就捕获四十二名。国民党土匪特务曾想利用少数民族地区进行反革命活动，他们是彻底失败了。同时有许多的大匪首都是我们兄弟民族捕杀的。
    过去由于反动统治者挑拨离间，各族之间很不团结，常常打冤家。有的彝民说：“我们这个地方在全国是有名的，过去那一天不死人？”解放以来，一切都变了，首先是专区民族民主政权之建立，各民族间变极端恶劣关系而为团结的关系了。民族间和民族内部遗留下来的纠纷大部分已经解决。仅专署，昭觉县，普格设治局三个单位，总计一年来的已调解的纠纷至少有一千七百多件。现在专区和县，都订立了团结公约。彝族中的打冤家基本上已经停止。以前大小凉山许多人不仅没有到过汉人地区，就连几里路以外的地方也不敢去。现在没有了冤家，各地已经通行无阻了。
    各族人民的经济生活和文化生活也有了改变。过去我们是光着脚板走路的，草鞋也成了宝贵的东西，穷困使我们一年当中仅能吃到两、三次盐巴。现在昭觉已成立了贸易支公司，并建立了一个集场，有的地方设立了推销站，贸易小组在各地流动，大大方便了物品交换。许多彝民并成群结队的驮运土产到西昌去换取日用品。因为土产有了销路，一般人都比以前宽裕了；日用品，特别是盐巴和布匹，也不像过去那样感到缺乏了。过去大部分人没有布裤子穿，现在十有八九的人都穿上新裤子了。文化教育方面，专区设立了一所民族干部学校，两所民族小学。中央访问团为彝族制订了一套新文字方案，现在有一千多人在学习，准备作教师。有的人学习两个月就可以写作，因而造成了彝族人民学习文化的热烈风气，现在五十多岁的彝族老人也在努力学习新文字。中央访问团和人民解放军、人民政府，还为各族人民医病，彝族中有二千多人害麻疹和其他病，这在过去是无法挽救的，这次因为得到救治，都没有死。
    各族人民深深体会到人民政权给予自己的好处。为了保护自己的政权，他们都热烈地起来参加地方武装，昭觉已开始建立了一支彝族公安武装——基干第三团。抗美援朝爱国运动也在日益开展。举一个昭觉城区的例子，八且、阿硕、瓦渣三个支头的头人，曾自动邀集六十余人，举行抗美援朝会议，捐献了一百零八两银子、七只羊子、一匹马和若干人民币，并写慰问信和订立爱国公约。八且枯梯他有三个儿子，他说要出一个保卫祖国，去朝鲜痛打美帝国主义。
    一年多来，西昌专区的工作有了许多重要的成就。为了进一步改善各族人民的生活，今后还有很多事情要做，例如：还有若干地区的民族民主政权必须迅速建立；交通问题急需解决，现在从昭觉到西昌要走三、四天，从西昌到雅安要走十二天，来往很不方便。医药卫生事业也要大力发展。各族人民对今后的建设都有着坚强的信心，他们深信，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在毛主席的领导下，一切建设事业一定会逐步地发展起来。
    解放前，国民党反动派曾三次调派大军向彝族聚居的大小凉山进攻，并且用美国飞机虐杀彝族人民，当时西昌地区各族人民都受到国民党反动派各种各样的奴役和迫害。现在，这些人民已经做了自己国家的主人，被欺侮与被损害的日子永远过去了。这种伟大的变化，在我们少数民族感到，真是不得了的开天辟地的大事情。我们西昌各少数民族全体人民万分地感谢中国共产党、中央人民政府和各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席给予我们光明和幸福。
    中国农工民主党中央监察委员会主席彭泽民发言
    坚决为完成抗美援朝增产节约而奋斗主席、各位同志：
    这几天我听到毛主席的指示，周总理的政治报告，彭真副主席的关于抗美援朝的报告，以及陈副总理的财政经济工作报告和郭副总理的文化教育工作报告，我感到无限的兴奋！首先我对于这些报告表示十二万分的同意。
    这一年来，我们国家，无论在外交战线上，财政经济战线上，文化教育战线上，以及国防建设生产建设，都已获得了伟大的胜利和光辉的成就。特别是在全国展开抗美援朝，土地改革，镇压反革命三个大规模运动以来，我们在国内已经更进一步地实现了前所未有的全国统一，加强了全国的团结，巩固了人民民主专政和涌起了爱国增产的高潮；我们在国外，严重地打击了最后的，凶顽的侵略者——美帝国主义，大大地提高了我国国际的威信，大大地鼓舞了殖民地国家民族解放运动，以及世界人民解放运动的胜利信心。这就是仅仅在一年的时间中，我们所获的胜利，这些胜利是中国人民的力量的具体表现。毛主席说：“这种力量，是任何敌人所不能战胜的”，是的，敌人已经开始在我们的力量前面发抖了。
    我们之所以能发挥这样伟大的力量，我们之所以能获得这样伟大的胜利，完全是由于毛主席和中国共产党的英明的，正确的领导，有了这样的领导，才保证了中国人民由胜利走向胜利。
    我们充分认识到，由于美帝国主义用种种无耻方法阻扰在朝鲜的停战谈判，由于美帝国主义不顾我国的抗议和苏联的建议，而悍然单独对日媾和，这些都说明了美帝国主义进攻我国的野心，还是一点也没有改变。
    毛主席指示我们：“为了继续坚持这个必要的正义的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务，因此也就是我们这次会议的中心任务。”我认为毛主席这一指示是中国人民走向胜利的唯一大道，我代表中国农工民主党对于这一英明正确的指示，表示坚决的拥护。
    我们这次会议，接受了毛主席的指示，同意彭真副主席的关于抗美援朝的报告，已经全体一致地作成了“关于抗美援朝工作的决议”，这是符合全国人民的要求的。中国农工民主党完全接受这个决议，而且要把这个决议作为今后的中心任务，继续为抗美援朝增产节约而奋斗。
    毛主席说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”中国农工民主党愿为实现毛主席这一伟大指示而继续努力。我们要求把思想改造运动和抗美援朝、国家建设的运动结合起来，把思想改造运动和爱国增产节约运动结合起来，我们要求从这些实际的行动中来进行我们的思想改造，我相信不久的将来，全国即将涌起毛泽东思想学习的高潮，这个高潮是我们走向胜利的无穷无尽的力量。
    我高呼：
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中朝人民的战斗团结万岁！
    中苏两国友好团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    九三学社主席许德珩发言
    号召社员努力学习毛泽东思想武装自己主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    首先，我代表九三学社全体同人向中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议表示热烈的祝贺！
    这次会议在中国人民志愿军为抗美援朝、保家卫国，英勇地出国作战一周年的时候召开，是有其伟大的历史意义的。我们完全拥护毛主席在开会词中所指示的中心任务：继续加强抗美援朝工作、增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，为争取抗美援朝战争的最后胜利、建设新中国保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平而奋斗！
    在这次会议中，我们聆听了周总理的政治报告、抗美援朝总会彭真副主席关于抗美援朝、保家卫国运动的报告、政协全国委员会陈叔通副主席关于全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告、陈云副总理关于财经工作的报告，郭沫若副总理关于文化教育工作的报告，我们热诚的拥护，并深深地感觉到我们的力量是强大无敌的，是不可被战胜的。这是因为我们有比资本主义国家具有千百倍优越性的人民民主专政制度，而这个制度是在中国工人阶级领导之下的，是在中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛主席领导之下的，是在具有科学真理的毛泽东思想领导之下的。因此，当我们举行第一届全国委员会第三次会议的今天，回顾新中国成立两年来的辉煌成就，我们不能不向中国工人阶级的弟兄们致敬，向伟大的中国共产党和毛主席致敬！
    这次会议的代表，包括了：中国人民志愿军，人民解放军，工业、农业劳动模范，老根据地的代表，教育、文艺工作者，工商业家，各种专家学者，宗教界人士，少数民族，华侨，妇女，青年，省市协商会议及其他方面的代表人物、政府各部门的首长，这充分地表现了中国人民进一步的、坚强无比的团结力量。有了这样坚强无比的团结力量，在毛主席和中国共产党正确领导之下，一定能够胜利地打垮敌人，建设我们的国家。
    从去年六月全国委员会第二次会议到现在、短短的一年多的时间，我们的政府在各方面都有了超越中国历史上几十年几百年以至于多少年的成就，它完成了三亿以上农业人口地区的土地改革，根治了历年灾荒的淮河；肃清了为害人民的土匪、改变了七十三年来半殖民地性的贸易入超成为出超；和平地解放了西藏，基本地稳定了多年来动荡不宁的物价，这些都是奇迹。这些奇迹，只有在中国共产党领导下的新中国才能出现，只有在毛主席领导下的新中国才能出现！
    这次会议，我们来自各方面的代表聆听了毛主席周总理及政府首长的报告，都表示衷心的拥护，忠诚的热爱；他们这种拥护与热爱，表现在大会发言上、表现在小组讨论上、表现在各种会议上，他们的提案达一百余件之多，充分地表现了知无不言言无不尽的爱国精神，充分地具备了人民民主气氛；我相信把这种气氛带回到每一个地区去，一定更能够加强国家建设的和团结的力量。
    在这次会议召开的十二天以前，毛主席的辉煌巨著“毛泽东选集”出版，这是中国人民乃至全世界人民的一件大事。中国人民革命在毛泽东思想领导之下，获得了空前伟大的胜利，这个胜利，改变了中国的历史，改变了亚洲和世界的面貌。因之，我们除了为“毛泽东选集”的出版而热烈欢呼之外，更要响应周总理的号召，号召九三学社社员和全国文教科学工作者，认真地学习毛主席的思想，用毛泽东思想来武装我们自己，改造我们自己，这是第一。第二，我们九三学社的同人更要在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，努力做好统一战线工作，巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，巩固并加强人民民主专政，保障我们革命胜利的果实，保证我们建设事业的成功！第三（我们还要重复地说一遍）要遵照毛主席的指示继续加强抗美援朝工作，增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军为我们的中心任务，贯彻爱国主义和国际主义的思想教育，订好爱国公约，并动员我们一切的力量，彻底打败美帝国主义侵略者，解放台湾，建设新中国，保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平。
    中国人民政治协商会议成功万岁！
    中国人民反帝斗争胜利万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    中国致公党主席陈其尤发言
    衷心拥护和实行本次会议的一切决议主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我代表中国致公党对毛主席的开会词、周总理的政治报告以及陈叔通副主席、彭真副主席、陈云副总理和郭沫若副总理的报告，表示完全同意和热烈拥护。这些报告，使我们对于中国人民如何获得今天的胜利，如何争取更大的胜利，有了深刻的认识。
    从全国委员会第二次全体会议开会以来，仅仅十六个月的时间，中国人民已获得了自己历史上空前未有的胜利。首先是抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动的胜利；其次是西藏和平解放，整个中国大陆实现了从来未有的人民统一；同时财政经济和文化教育工作各方面都获得了伟大的成绩。所有这一切胜利，都是在以毛主席为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导之下，在全国人民革命大团结基础之上获得的。
    在我们所得到的这些胜利中，最足令中国人民引以为荣的是伟大的抗美援朝运动的辉煌成就。因为这个伟大的斗争，粉碎了美帝国主义的侵略计划，保护了亚洲的和平，不仅使中国人民在国际上的地位空前提高，同时鼓舞了全亚洲以至全世界的人民，使他们加强了反抗侵略，争取解放的信心。这是中国人民对世界和平的最伟大的贡献。我们除了感谢毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导之外，并对在朝鲜与朝鲜人民军并肩作战打击侵略者的中国人民志愿军致以最崇高的敬礼！
    中国人民，从一九四九年十月一日成立了自己的人民政府以来，仅以两年的时间，就得到了空前伟大的胜利，这一事实，充分证明了人民民主专政的优越性。然而，我们这种胜利，还是在以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营用尽一切方法和行动来干涉破坏和侵略我国的环境之下获得的。不难设想，假使没有帝国主义的侵略，我们的成就是一定更为伟大的。这一事实，使中国人民认识了以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营，是中国人民的真正死敌。全国人民只有加紧支援抗美援朝的运动，让我们的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军给予美帝国主义者以更沉重的打击，才能保障自己的国土安全和远东和平。不达到美帝国主义者知难而退同意和平解决朝鲜问题，我们是不停止也不能停止抗美援朝运动的。
    中国致公党的党员，多数寄居帝国主义国家，特别是美帝国主义的统治范围以内。他们都是受尽帝国主义的压迫与残害的。他们希望自身的解放和世界的和平，比之国内同胞，同样迫切，因之，对祖国的热爱，也同样热烈，对于伟大的抗美援朝运动，无疑地将以最大的力量予以支援。我代表本党在国内国外的党员向大会表示，无保留地响应祖国的一切号召，并衷心地拥护和实行本次会议的一切决议，特别对增产节约捐献武器的工作，将尽最大的努力去完成。同时，我们要响应周总理的号召，以极诚笃的精神来学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，巩固组织发展组织，在中国共产党领导下，加强与各兄弟党派的团结合作，扩大及巩固人民民主统一战线，争取人民事业的更伟大的胜利。
    祝大会胜利成功！
    祝毛主席，各位委员各位同志们健康！
