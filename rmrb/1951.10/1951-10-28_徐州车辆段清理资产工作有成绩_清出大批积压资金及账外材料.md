    Xuzhou Vehicle Depot Achieves Success in Clearing Assets
    Recovering Large Amounts of Backlogged Funds and Off-the-Books Materials
    Since the Xuzhou Vehicle Depot of the Jinan Railway Administration began clearing its assets in mid-August, it has achieved great results. During this inventory and quota-setting campaign, the surplus funds cleared out accounted for 79.8% of the total value of the stored materials. The asset clearing process revealed serious stagnation in materials. For example, the quota for 35mm round iron was only 50 kg, but the actual inventory was found to be 5,068 kg, enough for eight years of use. Another example is 88mm wire nails, where the quota was 2 kg, but the stock was enough for 20 years of use. The cleared-out iron and wood screws were sufficient for 24 years of use. In addition, the asset clearing process uncovered off-the-books materials worth over 200 million yuan.
    In order to improve the asset clearing work, the Xuzhou Vehicle Depot organized all its staff in July to study the asset clearing work. During the study, special attention was paid to correcting the "more materials are better than fewer, preparedness averts peril" supply system mentality that existed among some leading cadres. The leading cadres were encouraged to conduct self-criticism first, which inspired all the workers in the depot to recognize the shortcomings in their past work, laying a good foundation for the asset clearing in August. Because the leading cadres of the Xuzhou Vehicle Depot attached great importance to the asset clearing work, the work proceeded quickly and thoroughly. For example, the accessories repair shop, passenger and freight car repair shops, and the electrical shop all arranged all their tools and materials in advance, waiting for the asset clearing personnel to take inventory. In addition, the heads of each shop and office personally took action to assist in asset clearing, and inspected the "small warehouses" in each workshop, urging their subordinate units to carry out thorough clearing and registration without omission.

    徐州车辆段清理资产工作有成绩
    清出大批积压资金及账外材料
    济南铁路管理局徐州车辆段自八月中旬开始清理资产后，已收到很大的成果。在这次清点与定量运动中，清理出来的多余资金，占存料总值的百分之七十九点八。在清理资产中，发现了材料上严重的呆滞现象。例如：三十五公厘的元铁，定量只需五十公斤，而查出的实存量为五千零六十八公斤，足够八年之用。又如八十八公厘的洋钉，定量为二公斤，库存数足够二十年之用。清理出的铁木螺丝，足够二十四年之用。此外，在这次清理资产中，查出了价值二亿余元的账外材料。
    徐州车辆段为了把清理资产工作搞的更好，曾在七月份组织全段职工，展开关于清理资产工作的学习。在学习中，特别注意纠正某些领导干部中存在的“材料可多不可少，有备无患”的供给制思想，启发领导干部首先作了检讨，这样，就启发了全段工人认识过去工作中的缺点，为八月份清理资产打下了良好基础。由于徐州车辆段领导干部对清理资产工作很重视，所以此项工作进行较快，也比较彻底。例如配件修制场，客、货车修车场，车电场等，都事先把所有的工具材料排列起来，等待清理资产人员清点。此外，各场、室主任都亲自下手，协助清理资产，并检查各车间的“小仓库”，督促所属单位作到无遗漏的清理与登记。
