    Our Volunteer Army Shoots Down an American Plane
    Seizes Important Military Maps
    [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 26th] A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army shot down an enemy F-51 fighter plane over Yichuan at 5:00 AM on September 12th. The plane was burned upon impact, and the aircraft's serial number is unknown. The pilot fell to his death; the name "Meng Tanno" was written on his underwear. In addition to our army's "Safety Pass" (i.e., surrender pass), the pilot carried a silk map of 1:1,000,000 scale for aviation use. The front of the map is a detailed military map of North China centered on Beijing and Tianjin, our capital, and the back is a detailed map of the Bohai Bay centered on Lushun and Dalian. Both maps are marked with military secret symbols such as navigation points and directions. The map is currently being held at the headquarters of the Volunteer Army.
