New River Embankment and Old River Embankment
Wanbei Liu'an Special District Water Conservancy Headquarters Political Department
Two Projects Reflect Two Different Societies

In Datian Township, south of Zhengyangguan in Shouxian County, Wanbei, about five miles along the eastern bank of the Yi River, a tributary of the Huai River, you can see a brand-new section of embankment, which is called the New River Embankment by the local people; next to this section of the New River Embankment is a section of the original old embankment, which the local people call the Old River Embankment. The existence and construction history of these two sections of embankment vividly show the completely different features of the new and old societies.

Let us first look at the projects of the new and old river embankments: The New River Embankment is 400 meters long, 5 meters high from the water surface, 3 meters wide at the top, and has a slope of 1:5, with a total earthwork volume of more than 30,000 cubic meters. More than three months have passed since the completion of the project, and after several attacks by storms and heavy rains during the flood season and the scorching sun between summer and autumn, the embankment is still covered with green grass and there is not a single crack. When this embankment was built, the Liu'an Special District Water Conservancy Headquarters originally estimated that it would take 20 days to complete, but after the hard work of 1,600 laborers from Datian and Xiaoyan Townships after work started on June 10, 1951, it was completed in 15 days by June 25. Among them, construction could not be carried out for seven days due to heavy rain, so the actual working time was only eight days.

What about the Old River Embankment project? Its embankment section is only more than 300 meters long, the embankment is less than 3 meters high from the water surface, the embankment is less than 2 meters wide, the slope is only 1:3, and the earthwork is less than 20,000 cubic meters. The engineering standards cannot be compared with the New River Embankment. After this section of the embankment was built, it cracked and collapsed in less than a few months. It has been repaired several times since liberation to become the embankment section it is today. When this Old River Embankment was built in 1944, it employed 1,800 to more than 2,000 laborers, and the time spent was from April 2 to June 14, a total of more than 70 days, which was nearly four times longer than the time spent building the New River Embankment.

During the Kuomintang rule, farmers suffered greatly when building the Old River Embankment

When mentioning the construction process of the Old River Embankment, the farmers in Datian Township and nearby Xiaoyan Township will painfully tell you about the unspeakable disasters they suffered at that time. The laborers who built the Old River Embankment were forced to work by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits with guns. The people not only contributed labor and money, but also had to pay additional start-up fees, travel expenses, and hospitality fees. Although these expenses had already been paid before the embankment was built, they were still arbitrarily apportioned to the masses during the embankment construction. Each household had to pay at least 10 or 20 catties, or even hundreds of catties of grain at a time. For example, Liu Hongshu, a tenant farmer in Diannan Village, had already sent eight laborers, and once he was apportioned more than 500 catties of rice, which made him bankrupt. However, landlords and bullies such as Di Baiqian, Lao Zixing, and Chang Jinggan did not have to pay a penny. The money paid by the people was not used to build the embankment, but was embezzled by the officials of the pseudo-embankment construction committee for their own benefit. For example, Liu Mianzhi, the director of the pseudo-embankment construction committee, embezzled the ocean dollars issued by the reactionary government for embankment construction during this embankment construction, plus the blood and sweat money extorted from the masses, and bought three Mauser pistols and one light machine gun. He also bought a three-story, six-room building in Bengbu. Once, he spent thirty-six bags of ocean dollars meant for embankment construction on prostitutes in Zhengyangguan, while the laborers who built the embankment never received a single bag of ocean dollars.

Not to mention the masses contributing labor and money, they also had to endure the beatings and extortion of the supervisors. Every laborer who participated in the construction of the Old River Embankment was beaten. Farmer Liu Yingren recalled the scene at that time and said: "The members of the pseudo-embankment construction committee and the supervisors stood on the embankment like they were lined up, one every few feet. They held thick bamboo sticks in their hands and beat the laborers who were carrying soil. They wanted us to run with the soil, and if anyone ran slowly or spilled the soil, the sticks would hit them. Sometimes these thugs got angry and beat people indiscriminately." Zhu Fuchang, a poor farmer in Diannan Village, Datian Township, told us sadly: "When the Old River Embankment was being built, my father, Zhu Honghai, was already over sixty years old. Meng Jizhou, the supervisor on the embankment, said that he was not working hard enough and ordered two people to hold him down on the ground and beat him severely with shoulder poles, causing him to be covered in injuries. When I saw this, I ran over in a panic and begged Meng Jizhou for mercy, but instead, I was also beaten severely." Yu Si, a poor farmer in Datian Township, had his head broken by supervisor Zhan Mazi with a few sticks, and in less than a few days, Yu Si died of tetanus.

The Old River Embankment was built, but the farmland of nearby farmers was also ruined. Some people were left ruined and destitute as a result. The soil used to build the embankment was dug from the fields of poor, hired, and middle peasants. Not only were the planted seeds dug up, but the land was also ruined. The fields of landlords and bullies, even if they were near the embankment, were not allowed to be dug, and the laborers had to run far to their own fields to dig. It was originally stipulated that those whose fields were dug up would be compensated with grain, but no one whose fields were dug up saw a single grain of grain. Lu Yingchun, a poor peasant, had only a few acres of land, and after sowing, a large portion was dug up, and he was not compensated with a single grain of grain, leaving him with nothing to eat, so he had to work as a hired laborer. He was so angry and anxious that he fell ill and died in the summer of the following year. Liu Shize, a poor peasant, and his wife had less than one acre of land, and all of it was dug up without compensation. The couple had no other way to make a living and had to rely on begging. In less than two years, the man starved to death, and the woman was fortunate enough to receive government relief after liberation, otherwise she would have starved to death long ago.

The farmers in Datian Township described the scene when the Old River Embankment was being built: "At that time, on this embankment, you could only hear the scolding of the supervisors, the sound of sticks hitting people, and the moans and cries of the laborers." How could the embankment be built well under the dark and hopeless reactionary rule? The laborers who built the embankment could not resist openly, but they passively sabotaged in secret. That is why a small section of the embankment took so long to build and collapsed in less than a few months.

Under the leadership of the People's Government, farmers were overjoyed and encouraged to build the New River Embankment

All 1,600 laborers who built the New River Embankment voluntarily signed up and enthusiastically participated. After education and mobilization by the People's Government, they all realized that the fundamental solution to the Huai River problem was for their own vital interests, to increase production, and to strengthen national defense construction. Before the embankment construction, the difficulties in family life caused by the winter famine were alleviated by government relief and mass care, and wages were paid according to how much each person built. The wages they received not only solved their personal living problems, but also had a surplus to subsidize their families, so the laborers were able to work on the embankment happily without any worries. During the work process, leading cadres and laborers worked together like brothers, and after work, they taught the laborers to read, write, and sing, and read the newspaper to the laborers, gave them political lessons, and helped them progress. When the laborers got sick, medical teams came to treat them, and cultural troupes often came to perform plays and dances to express their condolences. All of this made the laborers fully feel that the working people were different from the past, so how could they not be overjoyed and actively work? The entire embankment project was carried out in an atmosphere full of unity, friendship, tension, and joy. The laborers always got up before dawn and worked under the stars and moon. The leading cadres did not need to urge them to work, on the contrary, they were always worried that the laborers were too tired, and every day when it got dark, they urged the laborers to go back to rest earlier. Under such circumstances, it is easy to understand why the New River Embankment could be built so quickly and well.

Now, the repaired Old River Embankment and the New River Embankment are not very different, but the people of Datian Township have not forgotten the various disasters they suffered when building the Old River Embankment.

    新河卡和老河卡
    皖北六安专区治淮指挥部政治处
    两个工程体现了两个不同社会
    在皖北寿县正阳关以南的大店乡，沿着淮河支流的渒河东岸的河堤走去，约五里路远，就可见到那儿有一节崭新的堤段，这就是当地群众所称呼的新河卡；紧接着这段新河卡的，是原来的一段旧堤，当地群众把它叫做老河卡。老河卡是在国民党反动政府统治时代的一九四四年修筑的，新河卡是解放后在共产党与人民政府的领导下修筑的。这两段河堤的存在与修建历史，鲜明地显示了新、旧两个社会绝然不同的面貌。
    让我们先看看新老两个河卡的工程吧：新河卡长四百公尺，距水面高五公尺，顶阔三公尺，坡度是一比五，全段土方计三万多公方。工程结束后到现在三个多月了，经过了汛期数次暴风大雨的袭击和夏秋间烈日的曝晒，堤上仍然是绿草平铺，没有一道裂痕。修这段堤时，六安专区治淮指挥部原预计需要二十日才能完成，但在一九五一年六月十日动工后，在大店、萧严两乡一千六百名民工的奋力赶修下，到六月二十五日共十五天内就完成了。而其中还有七天因大雨不能动工，实际只工作了八天。
    老河卡的工程又是怎样的呢？它的堤段长仅三百多公尺，堤高距水面不到三公尺，堤阔不到二公尺，坡度只是一比三，土方不到二万公方。至于工程标准更不能与新河卡相比。这段堤修好以后，不到几个月的工夫，就裂缝倾塌了，解放后经过几度培修，才成了今天的这一个堤段。而这段老河卡在一九四四年修建时，曾用民工一千八百人到二千余人，所花时间，是从四月二日到六月十四日，共历时七十余天，比修新河卡的时间超过了将近四倍。
    国民党统治时修筑老河卡，农民苦难重重
    提起老河卡的修建过程，大店乡及其附近的萧严乡的农民们，都会沉痛地告诉你关于他们当时所受到的诉说不完的灾难。修治老河卡的民工，都是蒋匪帮用枪杆逼迫去上工的。老百姓不但出力，出钱，还要另加什么开办费、出差费、招待费等等。这些费用在修堤前虽早已出过，但修堤时还要向群众任意摊派。并且一次摊派每户至少都要出十斤、二十斤，甚至到几百斤的粮食。如店南村佃中农刘宏树家已出了八个民工，有一次还摊上了五百多斤大米，弄得他倾家破产。但地主恶霸狄白谦、劳子兴、常敬干等却可以一文不出。老百姓所出的钱，并不是用在修堤上面，都被伪修堤委员会的官员们贪污自肥了。如伪修堤委员会主任刘绵之在这次修堤中，贪污了反动政府发下的修堤洋面，加上向群众勒索来的血汗钱，就买了三支驳壳枪，一挺轻机枪，又在蚌埠买了一所三层六间的大楼房。他有一次在正阳关嫖妓女，一下子就花了三十六袋修堤的洋面，而修堤的民工们却从来没有发到过一袋洋面。
    群众出力出钱不用说，还要遭受监工的毒打和敲诈。凡是参加过修老河卡的民工，没有一个不挨过打。农民刘应仁追述当时的情景说：“伪修堤委员会的委员们和监工们一上堤，就像排队似的，不到几丈远就站一个。他们手里拿着粗大的竹棍，动手就打挑土的民工。他们要我们挑着土飞跑，那个人要是跑慢了，或者撒了土，棍子就上了身。有时这些恶棍们发火了，就不分青红皂白地乱打起来。”大店乡佃南村农民朱富昌很伤心地告诉我们说：“修老河卡时我的父亲朱宏海已六十多岁了，堤上的监工孟寄周说他不下劲，叫两个人拿扁担把他按在地上毒打，打得他老人家遍体是伤。我看见了慌忙跑去，向孟寄周求情，谁知反把我也毒打了一顿。”大店乡贫农余四，被监工詹麻子几棍就把头打破了，不上几天，余四就害破伤风死掉了。
    老河卡的堤修好了，但附近农民的田地也被糟踏光了。有的人因此家破人亡。因为修堤所用的土，都是从贫、雇、中农的田里挖的，不但把种下的谷种挖掉了，而且地也挖坏了。地主恶霸们的田地，即使在堤的近旁，也不叫挖，要叫民工们远跑到自己的地里去挖。原来规定被挖掉田地的有粮食赔偿，但被挖掉田地的人，谁也没有见到一粒粮食。贫农鲁迎春，只有几亩地，下种以后，却被挖掉一大半，没有赔偿一粒粮食，害得他没有了吃的，只好去给人帮工。他一气一急，得病不起，第二年夏季便死了。贫农刘士泽夫妻二人的地还不到一亩，也全部被挖掉，没有赔偿。夫妻二人别无生路，只好靠乞讨过活，不到两年，男的饿死了，女的幸亏解放后得到政府救济，不然也早饿死了。
    大店乡的农民描写修老河卡时的情景说：“当时这段堤上呀，你只能听到监工们的叫骂的声音，棍子打人的拍拍的声音，和民工们的呻吟嚎叫。”在暗无天日的反动统治下面，堤怎么会修得好呢？修堤的民工们表面上不能怎样反抗，背地里却消极怠工。所以一小段堤修了那样长的时间，不到几个月就倒塌了。
    人民政府领导修筑新河卡，农民欢欣鼓舞
    修新河卡的一千六百名民工都是自动报名踊跃参加的。因为经过人民政府的教育动员，他们都认识了根治淮河是为了自己的切身的利益，是为了增加生产，增强国防建设的力量。修堤前因冬荒所造成的家庭生活的困难，又得到了政府的救济与群众的照顾，而且，在修堤时是看谁修得多发给工资就多。他们所得的工资粮不但解决了个人生活问题，还有剩余来补助家庭，所以民工们能毫无顾虑地愉快地上堤工作。在工作过程中，领导干部和民工们打成一片，像兄弟般地在一起工作，下了工还教民工们读书、认字、唱歌，又读报给民工们听，给民工们上政治课，帮助他们进步。民工们有了病，就有医疗队来替他们治疗，还有文工团常来演戏跳舞，表示慰劳。这一切，都使民工们充分感到劳动人民和过去不同了，他们怎能不欢欣鼓舞和积极劳动呢？整个堤段工程，都是在充满了团结友爱，紧张愉快的气氛中进行的。民工们总是天未亮就起了床，披星戴月地工作着。领导干部用不着去催他们上工，相反的，他们时时耽心着民工们是不是太累了，每天天黑还要催促民工们早些回去休息。在这样的情况下，新河卡为什么能修得又快又好，是很容易理解的了。
    现在，修复后的老河卡和新河卡已经没有太大差别，但大店乡的人们，还没有忘记修筑老河卡时的种种灾难。
