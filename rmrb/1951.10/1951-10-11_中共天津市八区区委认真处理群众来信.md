Party Life

    The District Committee of the CPC Tianjin Eighth District, seriously handles letters from the masses, strengthening the connection between the Party and the masses. From October of last year to June of this year, the Tianjin Eighth District Committee received a total of 712 letters and oral reports from the masses. At that time, the vigorous campaign to Resist America and Aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were underway, and most of the letters were accusations and reports of counter-revolutionary elements, totaling 590, accounting for 83% of the total letters, which shows that the people's government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has been grasped by the masses. There were also many criticisms and suggestions in the letters regarding the work style and methods of government staff, with a total of 61 criticisms and suggestions for government organizations and factories. In addition, there were 23 requests for mediation of disputes, 12 requests for relief and employment, and 26 others such as requests to allow their children to participate in national defense construction.

    The Eighth District Committee and relevant units have generally been very serious in handling letters from the masses. They have established a system of dedicated registration and follow-up. Some responsible cadres personally read and approved the letters. Generally, letters are investigated and studied before being processed. If the issues raised in the letters involve other departments, they are jointly investigated and studied with the relevant departments, solved together, and the masses are given timely replies. Therefore, problems are resolved in a timely and appropriate manner, which has a good impact on the masses. The District Committee has made special decisions on major issues raised in the letters. As a result, most of the 712 letters have been properly handled.

    The Tianjin Eighth District Committee proposed that letters from the masses must be handled seriously, because this is one of the important methods for the Party and the government to strengthen ties with the masses. We should learn from Chairman Mao's spirit of valuing letters from the masses, hold regular meetings to study this work, and have responsible comrades personally take charge of handling letters. For letters handed over to lower levels for handling, supervision and inspection should be carried out. If the problems raised in some letters cannot be resolved temporarily, the masses must be given a good explanation.

    中共天津市八区区委认真处理群众来信
    中共天津市第八区区委会，认真处理群众来信，密切了党和群众的联系。自去年十月至今年六月，天津市第八区区委共收到群众来信及口头报告七百一十二件。当时轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝与镇压反革命运动正在开展，来信也以控诉、检举反革命分子的为最多，共有五百九十件，占来信总数的百分之八十三，这说明人民政府镇压反革命的政策已为群众所掌握。来信中批评政府工作人员作风及工作方法的也很多，连同对机关、工厂的批评建议共有六十一件，此外，要求调解纠纷的二十三件，请求救济和谋职业的十二件，其他如要求准许自己的子弟参加国防建设等等的共二十六件。
    第八区区委及有关各单位，对群众来信的处理一般是非常认真的。他们建立了专人登记及催办等制度。有些负责干部并亲自批阅来信。一般来信均经过调查研究，然后才着手处理。来信中所提问题有涉及其他部门的，即与有关部门共同进行调查研究，共同解决，并及时给群众以答复。因此解决问题比较及时、妥善，对群众的影响也很好。对于来信中提出的重大问题，区委会均作专门决定。结果七百一十二件来信，大多数已得到适当的处理。
    天津市八区区委提出，必须认真处理群众来信，因为这是党和政府加强与群众联系的重要方法之一。应该学习毛主席重视群众来信的精神，定期召开会议研究这一工作，并由负责同志亲自掌握处理来信的工作。对于交给下级办理的来信，应督促检查。有些来信中所提出的问题，如果暂时不能解决，亦须向群众很好地进行解释。
