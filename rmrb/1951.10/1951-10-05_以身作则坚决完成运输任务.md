    Setting an Example to Resolutely Complete Transportation Tasks
    Model Transportation Worker of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Song Shanmu
    I joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army last year to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. I was originally the head of the transportation section of the Harbin Sugar Factory. While working at the sugar factory, I received the first-class award for factory construction work five times. In 1949, when the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League summarized its annual work, I was rated as a model League member.

    When the flames of U.S. imperialist aggression war burned to the Yalu River, although I was suffering from spinal tuberculosis at the time, in order to defend the motherland and defend Asian peace, I participated in the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea with my illness, doing transportation work for the front lines.

    After arriving at a transportation unit of the Volunteer Army, the higher-ups appointed me as a squad leader. I felt that my responsibility was even greater. Every time we drove out, I took care of everyone from behind. When some comrades drove their vehicles into ditches or experienced breakdowns, I would help them pull them out and repair them before continuing. Once, we were transporting cannons to the front line. The cannons were long and heavy, the vehicles were short and light, the road was narrow, and there were many mountain bends, and falling off the mountain would be fatal. I thought that Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members are not afraid of any difficulties or dangers, and as long as they are brave and calm, they can complete their tasks. I volunteered to lead the way in front. Finally, through everyone's joint efforts, we successfully completed this task.

    In March of this year, we went to Sasu-ri, and on the way, we encountered American planes strafing our vehicles. I got into the car and drove away. Enemy planes frantically strafed in the sky, chasing me for more than an hour. At dawn, I hid the car in a very safe place, and the car was not damaged.

    In transportation work, I can often set an example. Once, when we went to a certain place to transport supplies, I led the team in front, and I transported more than two train cars of supplies in one day. When other people's cars broke down, I towed their cars, and I also towed cars for people outside my team. Sometimes, when other people's cars broke down, I moved the things from their cars to my car, and then towed their cars to a safe place. Every time we went out, I made sure everyone was full and well-rested, but I wouldn't eat or sleep if I didn't have food or a place to stay.

    This time, coming to the capital of the motherland, seeing Chairman Mao, and participating in the National Day celebrations, made me more deeply appreciate the greatness of the leader and the greatness of the motherland. After I return to Korea, I will work a hundred times harder to promote everyone to better complete transportation tasks, strive for an early victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, liberate the Korean people, and protect the safety of the motherland.

    以身作则坚决完成运输任务
    人民志愿军运输模范  宋善牧
    我是去年参加抗美援朝志愿军的。我原来是哈尔滨糖厂运输股的负责人。在糖厂工作时曾得过五次建厂工作的一等奖。一九四九年，青年团哈尔滨市团委总结全年工作时，曾把我评为模范团员。
    美帝国主义的侵略战争火焰燃烧到鸭绿江边的时候，我当时虽然害了脊髓结核病，但为了保卫祖国和保卫亚洲和平，我带病参加了抗美援朝工作，做前线的运输工作。
    到志愿军的某运输部队后，上级任命我当小队长。我感到自己的责任更加重大了。每次出车都在后面照顾大家。有的同志把车开到沟里或发生故障时，我就在后面帮助他拉出来修理好再走。有一次往前线送炮，炮又长又重，车又短又轻，公路很窄，山弯又多，掉下山去就会摔死。我想，共产党员和青年团员是不怕任何困难和危险的，只要勇敢沉着，就能完成任务。我自报奋勇要在前面领路。最后经过我们大家伙一齐努力，我们到底圆满地完成了这个任务。
    今年三月去泗水里，在路上遇到美国飞机向我们的汽车扫射。我上车开着就跑，敌机在上空疯狂扫射，追了我有一点多钟。天放亮了，我把汽车掩护在一个很安全的地方，汽车未被损坏。
    在运输工作中，我能够经常做到以身作则，一次我们到某地运物资时，我在前面带队，我自己一天运送的物资就超过了两个火车皮的。别人的车发生故障时，我就给他拖车，并且还给自己队外的人拖车。有时别人的车坏了，我就把他车上的东西搬到自己车上来，然后再把他的车给拖到安全的地方去。每次出车的时候，我先让大家吃饱、睡好，至于自己没有饭、没有地方就不吃、不睡。
    这回，来到祖国的首都，见到毛主席，参加国庆节观礼，使我更深刻地体会到领袖的伟大，祖国的伟大。我回到朝鲜后，我更要百倍地努力，推动大家更好地完成运输任务，争取抗美援朝早日胜利，解放朝鲜人民，保卫祖国的安全。（附图片）
