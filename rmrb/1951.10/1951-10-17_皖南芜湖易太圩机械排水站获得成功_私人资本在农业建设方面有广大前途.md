    Successful Mechanical Drainage Station at Yitai Embankment in Wuhu, Southern Anhui
    Private Capital Has Broad Prospects in Agricultural Construction

    The successful establishment of the Yitai Embankment drainage station in the suburbs of Wuhu City, Southern Anhui, by the private China Farmland Water Conservancy Company points out a path for the development of private industry. Yitai Embankment is one of many embankments of varying sizes in the suburbs of Wuhu City, Southern Anhui, covering a total area of approximately 31,000 mu. In the past, it frequently suffered from "internal waterlogging," resulting in significant annual reductions in production. This year, with the strong support of governments at all levels, the private China Farmland Water Conservancy Company successfully completed the mechanical drainage project for Yitai Embankment. In July, Southern Anhui experienced severe flooding, and the Yitai Embankment mechanical drainage project played a certain role in this flood, saving more than 30,000 mu of farmland in the embankment from the disaster of internal waterlogging, and it has been warmly welcomed by the masses. For this reason, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has specially approved a five-year exemption from industrial and commercial tax for the drainage station to encourage private investment in farmland water conservancy.

    The main equipment of the Yitai Embankment mechanical drainage station includes: eight 150-horsepower Universal brand diesel engines, and twenty-four 14-inch diameter screw-type pumps, with a drainage capacity of 120,000 gallons per minute, equivalent to 7.5 cubic meters per second, which were purchased by China Farmland Water Conservancy Company as the company's investment. The machinery is priced as follows: 110 million yuan per diesel engine, and 20 million yuan per pump, totaling about 1.4 billion yuan. The civil engineering work is the responsibility of the government, which provided a loan of 900 million yuan. The total basic investment is approximately 2.4 billion yuan (including installation costs, estimated figures), with an average investment of about 80 jin of millet per mu. The operating fee collection method is as follows: Each mu pays the drainage station a water fee of 25 jin of rice per year (700 yuan per jin, including 1% interest, depreciation, and project management fees). If the year is blessed with favorable weather and does not require drainage, then 10 jin of rice is paid per mu. In this way, the company can recover its entire investment (including principal and interest) within six to ten years, and subsequent income will be profit. Fuel is borne by the masses themselves, and is shared according to actual consumption, estimated at about 20 jin of rice per mu. The total burden on the masses is approximately 45 jin of rice per mu per year. If drainage is successful and production is guaranteed, normal yield can reach 400 jin of rice per mu (some rice paddies can reach 500 to 600 jin), while in 1949, due to the major flood, the general yield was only about 200 jin. Therefore, the masses are fully willing to pay the 40 to 50 jin water fee.

    The success of the Yitai Embankment drainage project is inseparable from the following factors:

    (1) The correct leadership of the Central People's Government and relevant departments of governments at all levels, and the strong support of local Party and government leading organs: From the beginning, Mr. Jiang Guangtang, General Manager of China Farmland Water Conservancy Company, obtained the leadership of the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and received correct instructions on the work policy and development direction. The company also obtained instructions from the East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Southern Anhui Financial and Economic Committee, and determined the principle of public-private joint venture for the drainage station project. During the construction process, there were dangers of quicksand and levee breaches. The local Party and government leading organs mobilized the masses to rescue in a timely manner, and provided encouragement in spirit and material, so that the project could be successfully completed.

    (2) Careful investigation and correct design: Before the start of the project, the Southern Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau conducted a survey and measurement, drew detailed topographic maps, and investigated the water conditions of previous years and various relevant data as the basis for the design, and then determined the machinery to be used; this met the objective needs. In order to cooperate with the role of the machinery, very important facilities were also made in terms of civil engineering, which powerfully guaranteed the success of mechanical drainage. The mechanical engineering started at the end of April, and after more than two months, with the assistance of the Southern Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau and other agencies and the efforts of all the employees of the company, the project was completed before the major flood in July this year, and it timely exerted the effectiveness of drainage.

    (3) Close contact with the masses: At the same time as the engineering survey, the Southern Anhui Agricultural Engineering Team sent cadres to the local area to conduct publicity to the masses, and assisted the local masses in forming the "Yitai Embankment Water Conservancy Committee"; through this organization, the relationship between the government, the company, and the masses became closer, so that the project was carried out from beginning to end with the automatic and enthusiastic support of the masses. Because the masses consciously realized that this project was related to the interests of all the embankment residents, they quickly dredged the large and small drainage ditches of the entire embankment, and dispatched a force of 200 people at once to rescue a section of the embankment, ensuring the success of the project.

    The successful construction of the Yitai Embankment drainage project has guaranteed the harvest of farmland for the masses, increased the strength of national agricultural production, and also opened up a path for the future development of private capital in farmland water conservancy construction.

    皖南芜湖易太圩机械排水站获得成功
    私人资本在农业建设方面有广大前途
    私营中国农田水利公司兴办皖南芜湖市郊区易太圩排水站成功，给私营工业指出一条发展道路。易太圩是皖南芜湖市郊区许多大小圩田中的一个圩田，全部面积约三万一千亩，过去经常受到“内涝”的损害，每年减产情况相当严重。今年私营中国农田水利公司在各级人民政府大力支持之下，胜利地完成了易太圩机械排水工程。今年七月皖南发生了严重的水灾，易太圩机械排水工程已在这次水灾中起了一定的作用，使该圩三万余亩农田免除了内涝之灾，受到群众热烈欢迎。为此，政务院财政经济委员会特准予免征该排水站工商税五年，以鼓励私人投资于农田水利事业。
    易太圩机械排水站的主要设备是：一五○马力通用牌柴油机八台，十四吋口径螺浆式抽水机二十四台，排水量每分钟十二万加仑，合七·五个秒立方公尺，由中国农田水利公司负责购制，作为该公司的投资。机械作价：柴油机每台一亿一千万元，抽水机每台二千万元，共十四亿元左右；土木工程由政府负责，用贷款九亿元办理。全部基本投资约为二十四亿元左右（包括安装设备费，估计数字），平均每亩投资约为八十斤小米。经营收费办法如下：每亩每年由群众向排水站交水费二十五斤稻谷
    （每斤合七百元，包括一分的利息、折旧，及工程管理费），如逢风调雨顺的年成，不需排水，则每亩交稻谷十斤；这样公司在六年至十年内可以收回全部投资（连本带利），以后所得便是盈利了。燃料由群众自己负担，按实际消耗量分摊，每亩估计约摊二十斤稻谷。群众负担，每年每亩共约四十五斤稻谷，如果排水成功，生产量得到保证，正常产量每亩可达四百斤稻谷（部分稻田可达到五百斤到六百斤），而一九四九年由于大水灾，一般产量仅二百斤左右。因此群众对付出四十到五十斤的水费，是完全愿意的。
    易太圩排水工程的成功，是和下面几个因素分不开的：
    （一）中央人民政府和各级人民政府有关部门的正确领导与当地党、政领导机关的大力支持：中国农田水利公司总经理蒋光堂先生一开始就取得中央人民政府农业部农田水利局的领导，在工作方针和发展方向上得到了正确的指示。该公司又取得华东农林部及皖南财政经济委员会的指示，在排水站工程上，确定了公私合营的原则。在施工过程中，曾发生流沙及溃堤的危险，当地党、政领导机关发动群众及时抢救，并在精神和物质上予以鼓励，使工程得以顺利完工。
    （二）周密地调查，正确地设计：工程开始前，即由皖南水利局进行查勘测量，画出详细地形图，并调查历年水情，及各种有关资料，作为设计的依据，然后确定所用的机器；这样便符合了客观的需要。为了配合机器的作用，在土木工程方面也作了很重要的设施，有力地保证了机器排水的成功。机械工程自四月底开始，经两个多月的时间，在皖南水利局等机关的协助及该公司全体职工的努力下，把工程赶在今年七月大水前完工，及时地发挥了排水的功效。
    （三）和群众密切联系：与工程测量的同时，皖南农业工程队即派干部到当地向群众进行宣传，并协助当地群众组成“易太圩水利委员会”；通过这个组织，政府、公司和群众的关系更为密切，使工程从开始到结束，都在群众自动地和热烈地支援下进行。由于群众自觉到这个工程有关全部圩民的利益，便很快地疏浚了全圩大小排水沟渠，在抢救一段圩堤时，一下出动了二百人的力量，保证了工程的成功。
    易太圩排水工程的建设成功，为群众保障了农田的收获，为国家的农业生产增加了力量，也为今后私人资本在农田水利建设方面的发展开辟了一条道路。（朱效章）
