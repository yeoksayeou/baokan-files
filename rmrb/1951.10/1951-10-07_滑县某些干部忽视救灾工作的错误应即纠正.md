Party Life Commentary

    The mistake of certain cadres in Hua County neglecting disaster relief work should be corrected immediately.
    According to the Pingyuan Daily, the flood disaster in Hua County, Pingyuan Province this year is relatively serious. The disaster-stricken area of the county totals more than 503,000 mu, and the affected population is more than 158,000. However, some party member cadres in the county are indifferent to this serious situation. They believe: "Only a line of land is flooded, and the places that are not flooded have a bumper harvest, it doesn’t matter whether or not we lead production and disaster relief!" "The south land is flooded, but there are good crops in the north land!" Under the control of this wrong idea, they did not seriously organize the masses to carry out disaster relief, resulting in serious development of the disaster situation, epidemic diseases in some villages, and deaths have reached 102. According to the registration of four districts, more than 700 people have fled.
    These comrades shout "serving the people" every day, but when they encounter a serious situation like 150,000 people affected by the disaster, they cannot put themselves in the shoes of the masses, and cannot regard the suffering of the masses as their own suffering, but lightly refer to it as "a line," as if it is nothing great. Chairman Mao taught us that all party organizations and party members must care about the people's lives at all times and everywhere, and sacrifice and struggle for the interests of the people. The erroneous behavior of certain party member cadres in Hua County in disregarding the interests of the people and not caring about the people's lives completely violated Chairman Mao's instructions. This is an intolerable mistake. The Hua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should seriously struggle against this error.

### 滑县某些干部忽视救灾工作的错误应即纠正

    滑县某些干部忽视救灾工作的错误应即纠正
    据平原日报载：今年平原滑县水灾比较严重，全县受灾面积共有五十万三千多亩，被灾人口有十五万八千多人。而该县某些党员干部，对此严重情况，竟漠不关心。认为：“淹的是一条线，没淹的地方是丰收，生产救灾领导不领导没啥！”“南地里淹了，还有北地里好庄稼！”在这种错误思想支配下，他们没有认真组织群众救灾，以致造成灾情严重发展，部分村庄疫病流行，死亡已达一百零二人，出外逃荒的据四个区登记已达七百多人。
    这些同志天天嘴上嚷的是“为人民服务”，可是，当着他们碰到像十五万人受灾的严重情况时，却不能设身处地地为群众着想，不能把群众的苦难当做自己的苦难，反而轻描淡写地称之为“一条线”，似乎没有什么了不起。毛主席教导我们：一切党的组织与党员，必须随时随地关心人民生活，为人民利益牺牲奋斗。滑县某些党员干部这种漠视人民利益，不关心人民生活的错误行为，完全背弃了毛主席的指示，这是一个不能容忍的错误。中共滑县县委应当认真同这种错误进行严肃的斗争。
