Former Chinese Students in Egypt, Ma Jian, etc., Send Letter to Egyptian Patriots
    Supporting the Egyptian People's Struggle Against Imperialism and for Independence
    Students of Peking University and North China University Send Letters to the Egyptian People Expressing Solidarity

[Our Newspaper] The following six former Chinese students in Egypt—Ma Jian, professor at Peking University; Liu Linrui, associate professor at Peking University; Wang Shiqing, lecturer at Peking University; Zhang Bingduo, part-time lecturer at Peking University; and Pang Shiqian and Yang Youyi, Imams of Beijing Mosque—wrote a letter on the 22nd of this month to Egyptian patriots from all walks of life, expressing their support for their just struggle against imperialism and for independence and autonomy. The original letter is as follows:

To the "Egyptian Gazette," Cairo:
    Respected Egyptian Patriots from All Walks of Life:

We once studied in your country, and we have always been concerned about your just struggle against imperialism and for independence and autonomy over the years. When our country was under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, we could not freely express our concern for you, which led to a long period of separation between us. Today, our country has stood up under the leadership of our great people's leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. We have seen in our country's newspapers your nationwide, vigorous struggle against British imperialism, as well as news of the British imperialists' slaughter, suppression, and continuous reinforcement of troops to your country. We, and all the people of our country, including those who believe in Islam, sincerely admire your heroic struggle and are filled with indignation at the shamelessness and ferocity of British imperialism!

Respected Egyptian People! Just as our "People's Daily" said in its commentary in support of you: "British imperialism is already a plucked and dying beast, and it cannot withstand struggle." We hope that you will resolutely and without illusions completely expel British imperialism from your territory. The Muslims of China, the entire people of China, and all peace-loving and justice-loving people in the world stand on your side. We will support you with the invincible power of the people until you achieve victory. As you know, the Chinese People's Volunteers are helping the Korean people fight another, more ferocious imperialism—American imperialism. We firmly believe that the people of our two countries will achieve final victory in the struggle against the imperialist robbers.

Ma Jian, Professor, Peking University; Liu Linrui, Associate Professor, Peking University; Wang Shiqing, Lecturer, Peking University; Zhang Bingduo, Part-time Lecturer, Peking University; Pang Shiqian, Imam, Beijing Mosque; Yang Youyi, Imam, Beijing Mosque (signatures)

[Our Newspaper] All the students of the Arabic Department of the Department of Oriental Languages of Peking University and all the students of Class A of the first year of the Department of Metallurgical Engineering of North China University wrote letters to the Egyptian people on the 20th and 21st of this month, respectively, expressing their sympathy and support for their just struggle for national independence and state sovereignty and against British imperialism.

The letter from the students of the Arabic Department of the Department of Oriental Languages of Peking University to the Egyptian people, written in Arabic, first condemned the British imperialist aggression of armed invasion of Egyptian territorial sovereignty, and expressed serious protest against the British imperialist suppression of the Egyptian people's bloody atrocities. The letter stated: "Respected Egyptian People, your struggle for independence and autonomy is completely justified, and all the just people of the world completely sympathize with and support you. The Chinese people understand your plight more deeply and fully support you. Facts have proven that only when you have fully gained independence and autonomy; only when you have driven imperialism out of your country's land, can the oppressed nations gain complete freedom." The letter concluded:

"With the close unity of the Egyptian people and with the support of the peace-loving people of the world, your struggle against imperialism will surely achieve final victory."

The letter signed by 36 students of Class A of the first year of the Department of Metallurgical Engineering of North China University to the Egyptian people stated: "When the news came that your just actions for independence, democracy, and freedom were being brutally suppressed by British imperialism, all the students in our class felt infinite indignation. We strongly protest against this despicable and barbaric means of British imperialism and wholeheartedly support your just struggle."

    我国前在埃及留学人士马坚等致函埃及爱国人士
    支援埃及人民反帝和争取独立的斗争
    北京大学和华北大学学生致函埃及人民表示声援
    【本报讯】我国前在埃及留学人士：北京大学教授马坚，北京大学副教授刘麟瑞，北京大学讲师王世清，北京大学兼任讲师张秉铎，北京清真寺阿訇庞士谦、杨有漪等六人，于本月二十二日写信给埃及各界爱国人士，声援他们反对帝国主义、要求独立自主的正义斗争。原信如下：开罗“埃及人报”转敬爱的埃及各界爱国人士：
    我们曾经在你们的国度里学习过，我们对你们多少年来反对帝国主义、要求独立自主的正义斗争，无时无刻不在关心着。当我们的国家在蒋介石匪帮统治时期，我们不能自由地表示我们对你们的关切，以致我们和你们之间有了长期的隔绝。今天，我们的国家在我们伟大的人民领袖毛泽东主席领导之下站立起来了，我们在我国的报纸上看到了你们举国一致的反对英帝国主义的轰轰烈烈的斗争以及英帝国主义对你们屠杀、镇压和不断向你们的国家增兵的消息，我们，以及包括信仰伊斯兰教的我国全体人民对你们这一英勇斗争无不衷心敬仰，对英帝国主义的无赖和凶狠无不愤慨填膺！
    敬爱的埃及人民！诚如我国的“人民日报”在声援你们的评论中所说：“英帝国主义已经是落了毛的垂死的野兽，它是经不起斗争的。”愿你们坚决地、不存幻想地把英帝国主义从你们的国土上全部驱逐出去。我们中国的伊斯兰教徒，我们中国的全体人民，以及全世界爱好和平和正义的人民，都是站在你们这一边的。我们将以不可战胜的人民的力量支持你们，直到你们胜利为止。我们中国人民志愿军，如你们所知，正在帮助朝鲜人民打击另一个更凶恶的帝国主义——美帝国主义。我们坚决相信我们两国人民将在反对帝国主义强盗的斗争中获致最后的胜利。
    中国北京大学教授马坚，北京大学副教授刘麟瑞，北京大学讲师王世清，北京大学兼任讲师张秉铎，北京清真寺阿訇庞士谦、杨有漪（签名）
    一九五一年十月二十二日
    【本报讯】北京大学东方语文学系阿拉伯语科全体同学与华北大学工学院冶金工程系一年级甲班全体同学，于本月二十日与二十一日分别写信给埃及人民，对他们为争取民族独立与国家主权、反对英帝国主义的正义斗争，表示同情与支持。
    北京大学东语系阿拉伯语科同学以阿拉伯文写给埃及人民的信中首先斥责英帝国主义武装侵犯埃及领土主权的侵略行为，并对英帝国主义镇压埃及人民的血腥暴行表示严重的抗议。该信称：“敬爱的埃及人民，你们要求独立自主的斗争是完全合理的，全世界的正义人民完全同情与支持你们。中国人民是更深切了解你们的遭遇并全力支持你们的。事实证明：只有在自己完全获得独立自主的时候；只有把帝国主义从自己国家的土地上驱逐出去的时候，被压迫的民族才能获得完全的自由。”该信最后称：
    “在埃及人民的紧密团结下，在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，你们反对帝国主义的斗争，一定能够获得最后胜利。”
    华北大学工学院冶金系一年级甲班三十六位同学签名给埃及人民的信上说：“当你们为争取独立、民主与自由而斗争的正义行动受到英帝国主义极端蛮横镇压的消息传来时，我们全班同学感到无限的愤慨。我们对英帝国主义这种卑鄙的横蛮手段，提出严重的抗议，并且衷心地支持你们的正义斗争。”
