    Support the Struggle of the Innocent Defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident"
    To the Editor:
    After reading the letter to the People's Daily from Suzuki Shin, Kikuchi Takeshi, and other innocent defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident," my heart was ignited with flames of anger towards the American and Japanese reactionaries. Kikuchi Takeshi said in his letter: "Truth will surely prevail," "We are determined to wage a resolute struggle against the hateful enemy. To crush the enemy's conspiracy, to fight to the end for freedom, peace and independence…!" Their spirit of heroic and unyielding struggle against the enemy is worthy of study by every one of our youth.
    We, the youth of New China, must display the revolutionary spirit of mutual assistance and fraternal love, and support the just struggle of the innocent defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident." Let us bring out our greatest strength to defeat the conspiracy of imperialism!

    支援日本“松川事件”无辜被告的斗争编辑同志：
    我读了日本“松川事件”的无辜被告铃木信、菊地武等给人民日报的信后，心中燃起了对美日反动派的愤怒的火焰。菊地武在信里说：“真理必定胜利”，“我们决心和可恶的敌人进行坚决斗争。为粉碎敌人的阴谋，为争取自由、和平与独立……而斗争到底！”他们这种对敌人进行英勇不屈的斗争精神，是值得我们每一个青年学习的。
    我们新中国的青年要发挥革命的互助友爱精神，支援日本“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争。让我们拿出我们最大的力量来击败帝国主义的阴谋！
