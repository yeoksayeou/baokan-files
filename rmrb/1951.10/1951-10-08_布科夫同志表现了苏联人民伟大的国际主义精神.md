    At the opening of the Second Annual Meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I, on behalf of the people of the Huai River area and the workers in the Huai River project, extend warm congratulations to the congress and would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the Soviet experts participating in our country's construction.
    Chairman Mao issued the call last year to "Be sure to harness the Huai River well," and the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Harnessing the Huai River." With the support of the people of the whole country, the people of the Huai River area launched a huge mass campaign to harness the Huai River, completed the first year's project plan, and are actively preparing to meet the glorious task of the second year. Looking back on the achievements and experiences of the past year, we will never forget the help of Soviet expert Comrade Bukov.
    In old China, the Kuomintang reactionary government also invited American and German experts to help formulate the Huai River project plan. All these plans had only one basic content: to send the water of the Huai River to the sea. Chairman Mao instructed us: to turn the water disasters of the Huai River into water conservancy. Comrade Bukov helped us to implement this policy in the technical planning. He told us: "Water, in the Soviet Union, is considered the wealth of the people." He cherished China's water in the same way. Under his encouragement and help, we determined the large-scale reservoir project plan in the mountainous area of the upper reaches of the Huai River and the large-scale lake storage project plan in the middle reaches of the Huai River, requiring the interception and control of 16 billion cubic meters of floodwater as the basis for disaster removal and benefit creation in the Huai River, which was something that the reactionary rulers of the past dared not and could not propose.
    When planning the lake storage project in the middle reaches of the Huai River, according to the old technical ideas, we once believed that we could only build temporary grass dams to seek semi-control of the floods, so the maximum flow below Zhengyangguan would reach 8,500 cubic meters per second, but the riverbed below Zhengyangguan could only hold 6,500 cubic meters per second. Comrade Bukov helped us conduct scientific and precise analysis and proved that if we use the favorable terrain of Runheji to build a large diversion gate and properly operate the storage and discharge according to the specific laws of flood development, the maximum flow below Zhengyangguan can be kept below 6,500 cubic meters per second.
    According to the old technical tradition under American influence, the construction of a diversion gate with the scale of Runheji requires at least 12,000 foundation piles and 10,000 cubic meters of sheet piles. Under our conditions at that time, material supply and construction time were difficult. Comrade Bukov introduced the Soviet Union's advanced theory and experience in foundation engineering. With the joint efforts of the design staff and the laboring masses, they overcame various specific difficulties in design and construction, so that the entire construction of the diversion gate did not require a single foundation pile or a piece of sheet pile.
    In old China, in addition to the use of ancient plug-in gates, there was only one type of lifting gate using simple machinery. The width of each gate was generally no more than ten meters, and they were all manufactured in the United Kingdom and Germany and installed by foreign engineers. The total width of the Runheji diversion gate is 479 meters, and it is not suitable to use a lifting type. According to the needs of the project and China's existing mechanical manufacturing capabilities, Comrade Bukov suggested using a hydraulic opening and closing gate type, with the width of each gate reaching 45 meters, and helped complete the basic design. Under the leadership of the East China Industrial Department and the Shanghai Metalworkers' Union, the mechanical engineers and workers in Shanghai successfully completed the entire design, manufacture and installation work.
    Comrade Bukov demonstrated the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people with his practical actions. The working principle he pursued was: to hand over the technical knowledge he had learned to the Chinese people without reservation, so that the Chinese people could complete their own construction with their own materials and their own strength, and truly learn to master these advanced technologies in practical work. With this selfless help, the Chinese people built the first large water gate in history with their own hands, and Chinese engineers took on all the technical work in the construction of the water gate themselves after studying with him for two months. His working attitude is: to serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly. During his work in the Huai River area, he suffered from overwork, and his eye disease recurred. The doctor warned that there was a risk of blindness if he did not receive timely treatment and recuperation, but he ignored everything and insisted on working despite his illness. He said that he must complete this task because Chairman Mao said: "Be sure to harness the Huai River well!"
    In our joint work with Soviet experts, we used the names of Stalin and Mao Zedong as a basic common language. We realized that learning from Soviet experts is not only about learning the various specific experiences they introduced to us, but also about learning their positions, viewpoints, and methods in solving scientific and technological problems, and regarding them as concrete examples of Stalin-style red experts educated in Marxism-Leninism, and learning from them. We also realized that whether we can accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and whether we can cooperate closely with Soviet experts, the basic key is whether we ourselves have a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and whether we ourselves can transform ourselves in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. Many technical workers learn from Soviet experience with a high degree of political awareness, a serious scientific attitude, and combine Soviet experience with China's construction practice, thereby significantly improving their work and making great progress individually. However, there are still a few technical workers who retain the old ideological influence of bourgeois education to varying degrees and cannot or can only accept and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to a limited extent, thereby causing losses to some of their work and failing to improve their personal level in a timely manner.
    The countless brilliant achievements of the Huai River project and the construction of New China in the past two years have concretely proved that learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is not a personal issue, but a matter of the development direction of the people's construction cause and the direction of scientific and technological progress. At this conference, we suggest that scientific and technological workers across the country launch a broader and deeper movement to learn from the Soviet Union, and intensify our studies to defend and build our great motherland, and intensify our studies to defend world peace.
    Long live Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!
    Long live our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong!
    Long live Comrade Stalin, the teacher of the world revolution!

    布科夫同志表现了苏联人民伟大的国际主义精神
    钱正英
    在中苏友好协会总会第二届年会及中苏友好协会全国代表会议开幕的时候，我代表淮河人民和治淮工程中的工作人员，向大会表示热烈的庆贺，并且愿意利用这一机会向参加我国建设工作的苏联专家表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    毛主席在去年发出了“一定要把淮河修好”的号召，中央政务院颁布了“关于治理淮河的决定”。淮河人民在全国人民的支援下，展开了巨大的群众性的治淮运动，完成了第一年的工程计划，并且正在积极准备，迎接第二年的光荣任务。回顾一年来的成绩与经验，苏联专家布科夫同志的帮助是我们永志不忘的。
    在旧中国，国民党反动政府也曾请过美国专家德国专家帮助制订淮河工程计划，所有这些计划只有一个基本内容：将淮河的水送到大海。毛主席指示我们：要将淮河的水患变为水利，布科夫同志帮助我们在技术规划上切实执行这一方针，他告诉我们：“水，在苏联，被认为人民的财富。”他同样的珍惜着中国的水，在他的鼓励与帮助下，我们确定了淮河上游山区的大规模的水库工程计划，淮河中游的大规模的湖泊蓄洪工程计划，要求拦蓄和控制一六○亿立方公尺的洪水量，作为淮河除灾兴利的基础，这是过去反动统治者所不敢也不能提出的。
    在规划淮河中游的湖泊蓄洪工程时，我们根据旧的技术思想，曾经认为：只能建筑临时性的草坝求得对洪水的半控制，因此，正阳关以下的最大流量便要达到八五○○秒立方公尺，但是正阳关以下河床却只能盛泄六五○○秒立方公尺。布科夫同志帮助我们进行科学精密的分析，并且证明：如果利用润河集这一有利地形，修筑一个大分水闸，并且根据洪水发展的具体规律恰当地操纵蓄泄，可以使正阳关以下的最大流量不超过六五○○秒立方公尺。
    按照美国影响下的旧技术传统，以润河集分水闸这样规模的建筑，至少需要一二·○○○根基桩，一○·○○○方公尺板桩，在我们当时条件下，材料供给和施工时间都有困难。布科夫同志介绍了苏联对基础工程的先进理论与经验，在设计工作人员与劳动群众的共同努力下，克服了设计与施工中的各种具体困难，使分水闸整个建筑不用一根基桩、
    一块板桩。
    在旧中国，水闸除了使用古老的插板式闸门外，只有一种利用简单机械的升降式闸门，每孔闸门的宽度一般不能超过十公尺，而且都在英国和德国制造，由外国工程师主持安装，润河集分水闸闸门总宽达四七九公尺，使用升降式是不合适的。布科夫同志根据工程的需要和中国现有的机械制造能力，建议采用液压启闭的闸门型式，每孔闸门的宽度达到四五公尺，并且帮助完成了基本设计。在华东工业部与上海五金工会的领导下，上海的机械工程师和工人胜利完成了全部设计制造和按装的工作。
    布科夫同志以他的实际行动表现了苏联人民的伟大的国际主义精神。他所奉行的工作原则是：将他所学到的技术知识无保留地交给中国人民，使中国人民能用自己的材料、自己的力量来完成自己的建设，并且在实际工作中真正学会掌握这些先进的技术，在这种大公无私的帮助下，中国人民用自己的双手修起了历史上第一个大水闸，中国工程师们在跟他学习两个月后，自己担负起水闸建筑中的全部技术工作。他的工作态度是：全心全意为中国人民服务。在淮河工作期间，他曾因疲劳过度，眼病复发，医生警告如果不及时治疗休养有失明的危险，但是他不顾一切，带病坚持工作，他说，他必须完成这个任务，因为毛主席讲了：“一定要把淮河修好！”
    在与苏联专家共同工作中，我们以斯大林毛泽东的名字作为基本的共同语言，我们体会到，向苏联专家学习，不仅要学习他们所介绍给我们的各种具体经验，更要学习他们在解决科学技术问题中的立场、观点、方法，将他们看作在马克思列宁主义教养下的斯大林式的红色专家的具体榜样，向他们学习。我们更体会到，能不能接受苏联的先进经验，能不能和苏联专家密切合作，其基本关键是我们本身是否具有高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，我们本身能否按照毛泽东思想来改造自己。许多技术工作者以高度的政治觉悟、严肃的科学态度、认真地学习苏联经验，并且使苏联经验与中国的建设实践结合，因而使工作得到显著的提高，个人得到很大的进步。但是还有少数技术工作者在不同程度上保留着资产阶级教育的旧的思想影响，不能够或者只能有限度地接受和学习苏联的先进经验，因而使部分工作受到损失，个人水平不能及时提高。
    治淮工程和新中国建设两年来的无数辉煌成就具体地证明了，学习苏联的先进经验，这不是什么个人问题，而是人民建设事业的发展方向、科学技术的进步方向问题。在这个大会上，我们建议全国科学技术工作者开展一个更广泛更深刻的学习苏联的运动，为保卫和建设我们的伟大祖国而加紧学习，为保卫世界和平而加紧学习。
    中苏友好合作万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    世界革命的导师斯大林同志万岁！
