Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

To the Editor:

From August 8th to November 19th last year, our factory's No. 4 coal baking tank workshop experienced three consecutive serious accidents involving workers being burned to death or injured. When the first accident occurred, the workers in the workshop suggested improving the safety equipment, but the management did not adopt the suggestion, and the trade union did not supervise it, leading to the second and third accidents. After the People's Daily criticized this matter on April 18th, the trade union first, based on the workers' opinions, urged the factory to build an insurance wall at the flame-spraying point of the No. 4 coal baking tank. In addition, asbestos clothing and lighting, among other safety equipment, were added. The coal baking tank has been operating safely for more than four months since it was fired up on April 30th without any accidents. In order to make the factory pay attention to safety issues, the trade union mobilized employees to conduct a general safety inspection. After the inspection, the employees made 601 suggestions. On May 25th, the Labor Protection Department of the trade union, together with the factory director and relevant units, conducted a detailed investigation in the workshops and workplaces. Based on everyone's suggestions, a plan for improving safety equipment was drawn up. Most of the suggestions made by the workers have now been adopted. 114 items were implemented in June, 79 in July, and 95 in August. In addition, the trade union has set up safety competition boards at the entrances and exits for workers going to and from work, using colors to indicate the situation of work-related injuries and accidents, so as to improve employees' attention to safety and hygiene at all times. This method has also produced good results.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    唐山启新洋灰厂接受批评改进安全设备编辑同志：
    自去年八月八日起至十一月十九日止，本厂四号烤煤罐一个车间，曾连续发生三次烧死、烧伤工人的严重事故。当第一次事故发生时，该车间工人曾建议改进安全设备，资方没有采纳，工会也没督促，以致接连发生了二、三次事故。四月十八日人民日报读者批评了这件事情后，工会首先根据工人的意见，督促厂方，在四号烤煤罐喷火处砌上了一道保险墙，另外还添了石棉衣和照明等安全设备。该烤煤罐从四月三十日开窑，到现在已安全运转四个多月未出过事故。为了使厂方重视安全问题，工会发动职工普遍进行了安全检查。经过检查后，职工们提了六百零一件意见。五月二十五日，工会劳保部会同厂长及有关单位，深入车间及工作场所，进行详细调查，根据大家所提意见，订出了改进安全设备计划。现在工人们所提出的意见，大部分已被采纳了。六月份实行了一百一十四件，七月份实行了七十九件，八月份实行了九十五件，除此以外，工会在上下班出入的地方，设立了安全竞赛牌，用颜色来表示工伤及事故的情况，以随时提高职工对安全卫生的注意。这种方法，也产生了良好的效果。
