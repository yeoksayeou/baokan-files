    Resolutely Support the Anti-Imperialist Struggle of the Iranian and Egyptian People!
    To the Editor:
  Following Iran's decision to implement the nationalization of its oil, the Egyptian government has also announced the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the Anglo-Egyptian "Condominium" Agreement on Sudan; the people of Iraq have also voiced slogans demanding the abolition of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The upsurge of the Middle Eastern people's struggle movement fills me with boundless excitement. We Chinese people should support their struggle and cheer for their victory!
    We Chinese people have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against imperialist aggression and resolutely support the struggle of the Asian and world people for national independence. We must use even greater victories in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to strike at imperialism and support the struggle of oppressed nations and peoples!

    坚决支持伊朗和埃及人民的反帝斗争！编辑同志：
  继伊朗决定实行石油国有化以后，埃及政府也宣布废除英埃条约和英埃“共管”苏丹协定；伊拉克的人民也发出了要求废除英伊条约的口号。中东人民斗争运动的高涨，使我感到无限的兴奋，我们中国人民应该支持他们的斗争，并为他们的胜利而欢呼！
    我们中国人民始终站在反对帝国主义侵略斗争的最前线，并坚决支持亚洲与世界人民争取民族独立的斗争。我们要用抗美援朝更大的胜利来打击帝国主义，支援被压迫民族和人民的斗争！
