The people of Duoying Township, Ya'an County, Xikang Province—the hometown of Tian Wenfu, a combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers—wrote a letter to Tian Wenfu while preparing to commemorate the first anniversary of the Volunteers' participation in the war abroad, reporting on the anti-U.S. and aid-Korea movement in their hometown. The letter stated:

"Comrade Wenfu, it has been almost a year since you joined the Volunteers to go abroad and fight the American bandits. In this year, all the people in our township have been actively engaged in production, and the township's grain harvest has increased by 10% compared to previous years. We know that such good times are ensured by your brave fight against the enemy in the front.

"The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is developing vigorously in our township. Among the 1,050 households in the township, 1,025 have signed patriotic pacts. Most of them have been carefully discussed and repeatedly revised in family meetings. The patriotic pact of Youth League member Zhao Xueyu's family has been revised seven times. Most families have included plans to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons in their patriotic pacts. As a result, everyone is more motivated to produce, and the donation movement is ahead of other townships. Before the autumn harvest, the people of the township intensified various sideline productions such as cutting firewood and bamboo, and overfulfilled the planned donation targets ahead of schedule. Everyone said: The money should be paid in full as soon as possible so that the front can have more airplanes and cannons earlier.

"Our township's work of giving preferential treatment to military families is also done very well. For more than 70 military households in the township, we implement a contract system of substitute farming by each village according to their lack of labor. The crops cultivated this year are growing well. We are currently threshing the rice, and your family's rice has been threshed by more than a dozen people in one morning. Now the autumn grain requisition has begun, and everyone says that you have become a combat hero in the front, and we must strive to be model grain deliverers. Li Zhengyang's family planted less rice and more corn this year, but his family would rather eat more corn and save rice to hand over public grain. He said: 'We must not take care of ourselves first and the country later.' This is truly what we all feel in our hearts."

The people of Duoying Township emphasized in the letter that they would continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, complete the land reform, and never slacken their efforts. The letter also repeatedly urged their heroic son, Tian Wenfu, to work hard to kill the enemy and strive for even greater achievements. (Xinhua News Agency)

    志愿军战斗英雄田文富故乡人民
    写信给田文富勉励功上加功
    中国人民志愿军战斗英雄田文富故乡——西康省雅安县多营乡人民在筹备纪念志愿军出国作战一周年时，写信给田文富，报告家乡抗美援朝运动情况。信中说：
    “文富同志，你参加志愿军出国打美国强盗快一年了。这一年，我们全乡人民都积极生产，全乡的粮食比往年多收了一成。我们知道这样的好光景，是你们在前方勇敢杀敌给我们保住的。
    “我们乡的抗美援朝运动开展得很热烈。全乡一千零五十户人家中，已有一千零二十五户订立了爱国公约。其中大多数是经过家庭会议认真讨论和一再修正的。青年团员赵学玉家的爱国公约修改过七次。绝大部分人家，都把增加生产捐献飞机大炮的计划列在爱国公约中，因此大家生产都长了劲；捐献运动，也走在别乡前头。在秋收以前，全乡人民就加紧进行砍柴、砍竹子等各种副业生产，提前超额完成了预定的捐献计划。大家说：要早一点把款子交齐，使前方早一点有更多的飞机大炮。
    “我乡的优抚工作也做得很好，全乡七十多户军属，我们按照他们劳动力缺少的情况，由各村实行包干代耕。今年代耕的庄稼都长得好。这两天正打谷子，你家的谷子，已由十几个人帮忙，一个早上就打完了。现在秋征已经开始，大家都说，你在前方当了战斗英雄，我们也要争个缴粮模范。李正杨家里今年种的谷子少玉米多，但他家宁肯多吃玉米，省下大米交公粮。他说：‘不能先顾自己，后顾国家。’这真是我们大家的心里话。”
    多营乡人民最后在信上着重表示：他们要继续加强抗美援朝工作，完成土地改革，绝不松劲下来。信上并一再嘱咐他们的英雄子弟田文富努力杀敌，争取功上加功。（新华社）
