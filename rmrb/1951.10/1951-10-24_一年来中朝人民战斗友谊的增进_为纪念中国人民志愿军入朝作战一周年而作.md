The Korean people, from the very first day of their righteous war of liberation to resist the armed aggression of US imperialism, have received the warm sympathy and support of the 475 million people of our great neighbor, the People’s Republic of China, and when the Korean war situation was at its most dangerous, they received the armed assistance of the Chinese people. It has been a full year since the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army came to Korea on October 25th of last year to fight alongside the Korean People's Army to eliminate our common enemy.

Over the past year, the Korean and Chinese people, whether on the front lines or in the rear, have stood shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, fighting together with strong brotherly friendship and unity, and have achieved great victories. Fighting side by side, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have dealt a heavy blow to the US and British armed aggressors who advanced to the borders of Korea and China a year ago, driving the enemy back to the 38th parallel and crushing the enemy's many crazy offensives. The US imperialist plan to quickly conquer Korea through a swift war has been completely bankrupted, and it has been forced to accept armistice talks.

Simultaneously with the victory on the front lines, our people in the rear have also achieved great accomplishments in our common struggle. Under the banner of the Republic, the Korean people are united as one around our wise leader, General Kim Il-sung, devoting all their strength to supporting the front lines and consolidating the rear, restoring industries destroyed by enemy bombing and shelling, carrying out agricultural production as usual, and victoriously completing wartime national production plans.

At the same time, the entire Chinese people, united under the righteous banner of the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement, have achieved brilliant successes in actively supporting the Volunteer Army, strengthening national defense and economic construction, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and developing a new culture, demonstrating to the world the great strength of the people of New China. The great achievements made by the peoples of Korea and China in supporting the front lines and consolidating the rear are the result of the close, brotherly unity of the two peoples. And these achievements have further consolidated the friendship and unity of the two peoples. In the righteous struggle to resist the common enemy of the peoples of Korea and China and the people of the world – the US armed aggressors – the peoples of Korea and China have displayed a noble spirit of patriotism and consolidated their friendship with the people of fraternal countries. Today, our Korean and Chinese peoples, holding high the great banner of patriotism and noble internationalism, are bravely advancing toward the common final victory. A year of experience has clearly proven that no matter how vicious an enemy may be, they cannot stop the joint struggle of our two peoples from achieving victory. The friendship and unity of our two peoples is unbreakable.

The whole world knows that in September of last year, after suffering heavy blows from the young Korean People's Army, the US invading forces had been retreating into a small area on the east bank of the Nakdong River. In order to save their ultimate defeat and further expand the war of aggression against Korea, the US imperialists gathered all their forces along the Pacific coast, and hundreds of planes and hundreds of warships, into the Korean battlefield. The US invading forces made a large-scale landing at Incheon, which caused a sudden change in the balance of power. In order to re-prepare forces to counterattack the enemy, the Korean People's Army had to carry out a temporary strategic retreat.

This change in the war situation made the US imperialist aggressive intentions even more apparent. The US attempted to take advantage of its temporary military advantage to annex Korea in one fell swoop and attack New China. In October of last year, the American bandits brazenly crossed the 38th parallel, trampled on the democratic construction of North Korea, massacred large numbers of North Korean people, and committed all kinds of unspeakable beastly atrocities. Then they crossed the Cheongcheon River and gradually approached the border between Korea and China – the Yalu River. At the same time, US planes constantly intruded into the airspace of Northeast China to carry out crazy bombing and strafing. Moreover, from the first day of launching the war of aggression against Korea, US imperialism mobilized its fleet to occupy China's Taiwan Province.

This situation clearly shows that the purpose of the American military adventure is by no means only to destroy Korea, but also to attempt to attack China. Therefore, the Chinese people certainly cannot ignore the US war of aggression against Korea. Moreover, the peoples of Korea and China have long forged a deep militant friendship with blood in the long common revolutionary struggle in the past.

The most urgent task facing the Chinese people at that time was to rise up to fight against the aggression of the American bandits, support the Korean people, and defend the security of their motherland. In order to realize the urgent demands of the Chinese people, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people stepped forward and formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, crossed the Yalu River, and fought alongside the Korean People's Army.

The volunteer entry of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army into the Korean War not only brought about a fundamental change in the Korean war situation, but also infinitely inspired the Korean people's fighting will and confidence in victory. The Korean People's Army immediately went on the counteroffensive with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, heavily hitting the US imperialist invading flames, and surged south with overwhelming momentum. The deep mountains and narrow valleys of North Korea became the graves of American bandits and their lackeys. The heroic operations of the Korean and Chinese People's forces caused heavy losses to the enemy.

Since the Korean and Chinese People's forces began fighting side by side a year ago, they have achieved great victories in the five campaigns and the recent months of blocking battles. We not only drove the enemy south of the 38th parallel and restored the entire northern half of the region from the enemy's clutches, but also took control of the initiative in the war. Over the past year, the Korean and Chinese People's forces have adhered to the correct strategic policy of eliminating the enemy's effective strength, and achieved brilliant results in killing, wounding, and capturing more than 380,000 enemy troops. The losses of the US invading forces have far exceeded the casualties of the US military in the first year of World War II.

The reason why the Korean and Chinese People's forces were able to achieve such great victories on the front lines is primarily due to the close unity and continuous increase in the militant friendship between the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. There are countless moving deeds of brotherly love shown by the Korean and Chinese People's forces in close coordinated operations. This friendship has further consolidated the unbreakable militant friendship and unity of the two peoples. At the same time, the righteous common struggle of the peoples of Korea and China to resist US aggression, defend their motherland, and safeguard peace in the East and the world is also a powerful guarantee for the Korean and Chinese People's forces to achieve one brilliant victory after another on the front lines.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting in the bloody battles on the Korean battlefield, is the embodiment of the noble spirit of internationalism. The Korean people have boundless love, respect, and gratitude for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

The Korean people have personally witnessed and experienced the boundless love of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, taught by the great Chairman Mao Zedong, for the Korean people and the boundless hatred for the enemy. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army selflessly rescued Korean men, women, old, and young from the bloody claws of American beasts. And their humility, kindness, and non-violation of the Korean people have further increased the Korean people's gratitude and respect for the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people who are carrying out the booming Resist America, Aid Korea movement under the banner of Mao Zedong.

In the past year, the Korean and Chinese peoples have done much historically significant work to further strengthen and consolidate the friendship and unity between the two peoples. The Chinese people have not only sent their outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean battlefield to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army, but have also repeatedly sent condolence delegations composed of representatives from all walks of life to the Korean front lines and rear areas to express their condolences to the Korean military and civilians. They have also sent a large number of transport teams, stretcher teams, and medical teams to the front and rear of Korea to carry out selfless struggles. In the past year, the Chinese people have donated more than 110 billion yuan in relief funds, more than 1.1 million pieces of condolence gifts, more than 800,000 condolence bags, and other various aid materials to the Korean people. All this has greatly inspired the Korean military and civilians' confidence in winning the war to resist America. The friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples has become even more consolidated. This friendship and unity is the great force that guarantees our common victory. Many Korean patriotic volunteers who participated in the Chinese revolutionary struggle realized their revolutionary beliefs with their own lives – the victory of the Chinese people's revolution is the victory of the Korean people. Last year, Mr. Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation who came to Korea to participate in the 5th anniversary celebration of Korea's liberation on "August 15th," conveyed the Chinese people's revolutionary belief to the Korean people – the victory of the Korean people is the victory of the Chinese people. The volunteer entry of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army into the Korean War further proves the close relationship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, who are as close as lips and teeth, and their unbreakable deep friendship.

Today, the heroism displayed by the militant friendship and solidarity of the Korean and Chinese peoples has set an example of internationalism for the people of the world. One year of experience has proven that no violence can destroy the friendship and unity of the Korean and Chinese peoples, nor can it prevent the common victory of the Korean and Chinese peoples from coming.

    一年来中朝人民战斗友谊的增进
    ——为纪念中国人民志愿军入朝作战一周年而作
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相  洪命熹
    朝鲜人民从奋起反抗美帝国主义武装侵略进行正义解放战争的头一天起，就得到了伟大的邻邦——中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民的热烈同情与支持，而当朝鲜战局处于最危险情况的时候，又得到了中国人民的武装援助。英雄的中国人民志愿军，从去年十月二十五日来到朝鲜，为消灭共同敌人而与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，到现在已经整整一年了。
    一年来，朝鲜人民与中国人民，无论在前线或后方，都是肩并肩，手携手，以坚强的兄弟般的友谊与团结，共同进行斗争，并已获得了伟大的胜利。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军并肩作战，已给予了一年前冒进到朝中两国边境的美英武装侵略者以沉重的打击，把敌人打到了三八线，粉碎了敌人多次的疯狂的攻势。美帝国主义妄图以速决战灭亡朝鲜的侵略计划，业已宣告完全破产，因而它被迫接受了举行停战谈判。
    与前线的胜利同时，我们后方人民也在共同斗争中取得了巨大的成就。朝鲜人民在共和国的旗帜下，钢铁般地团结在我们英明的领袖金日成将军的周围，献出一切力量来进行支援前线和巩固后方的斗争，恢复因敌人的野蛮轰炸与炮击而被破坏的产业，照常进行农业生产，胜利地完成了战时国家生产计划。
    同时，在伟大的抗美援朝运动的正义旗帜下一致奋起的全中国人民，在积极支援志愿军、加强国防与经济建设、巩固人民民主专政以及发展新文化等各方面，都获得了极其辉煌的成就，向全世界显示了新中国人民的伟大力量。朝中两国人民在支援前线与巩固后方的工作中所取得的巨大成就，是两国人民兄弟般地紧密团结的结果。而这种成就，更加巩固了两国人民的友谊团结。朝中两国人民在为反抗两国人民及全世界人民的共同仇敌——美国武装侵略者而进行的正义斗争中，发挥了崇高的爱国主义精神，巩固了与兄弟国家人民之间的友谊。今天我们朝中两国人民，高举起伟大的爱国主义和崇高的国际主义旗帜，正向共同的最后胜利勇敢地前进。一年的经验清楚地证明：任何穷凶极恶的敌人，也不能挡住我们两国人民的共同斗争走向胜利。我们两国人民的友谊团结，是牢不可破的。
    全世界都知道：当去年九月间美国侵略军在遭到年青的朝鲜人民军的沉重打击之后，曾一直败退到洛东江东岸的狭小地区。美帝国主义者为了挽救其最后失败的命运，并进一步扩大侵朝战争，调集了它在太平洋沿岸的全部兵力，和数百架飞机、数百艘军舰，投入朝鲜战场。美国侵略军在仁川大举登陆，从而使双方力量对比起了突然的变化。朝鲜人民军为了重新准备力量反击敌人，不得不实行了暂时的战略退却。
    战局的这种变化，使美帝国主义的侵略意图更加明显地暴露了出来。美国妄图挟其一时的军事优势，一举吞并朝鲜，进攻新中国。去年十月，美国强盗悍然越过三八线，蹂躏了北朝鲜人民的民主建设，大量屠杀了北朝鲜人民，制造了惨绝人寰的种种野兽暴行。接着便越过清川江，步步逼近朝中两国的边境——鸭绿江。与此同时，美国飞机不断地侵入中国东北的领空进行疯狂的轰炸扫射。而且美帝国主义从发动侵朝战争的头一天起，就动员其舰队霸占了中国的台湾省。
    这种情势明显地说明：美国军事冒险的目的，绝非仅仅在于灭亡朝鲜，而且妄图进攻中国。因此，中国人民对于美国的侵朝战争，当然不能置之不理。何况朝中两国人民在过去长久的共同革命斗争中，早已用鲜血结成了深厚的战斗友谊。
    当时摆在中国人民面前的最紧急任务，就是奋起为反抗美国强盗的侵略、支援朝鲜人民、保卫自己祖国的安全而斗争。为了实现中国人民的迫切要求，中国人民的优秀儿女乃挺身而出，组成了中国人民志愿军，跨过鸭绿江与朝鲜人民军并肩作战。
    中国人民志愿军的志愿入朝作战，不仅使朝鲜战局起了根本的变化，而且无限地鼓舞了朝鲜人民的斗争意志与胜利信心。朝鲜人民军立即与中国人民志愿军一起转入了反攻，沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略凶焰，并以排山倒海之势汹涌南进。北朝鲜的深山狭谷，成了美国强盗及其走狗的坟墓。朝中人民部队的英勇作战使敌人遭到了惨重的损失。
    朝中人民部队自一年前开始并肩作战以来，在五次战役及最近几个月的阻击战中，业已取得了伟大的胜利。我们不仅把敌人打到三八线以南去，从敌人的魔掌中光复了整个北半部地区，而且掌握了战争的主动权。一年来，朝中人民部队坚持了消灭敌人有生力量的正确战略方针，取得了毙伤俘敌三十八万余名的辉煌战果，美国侵略军有生力量的损失，已远远超过了美军在第二次世界大战第一年中的伤亡数字。
    朝中人民部队在前线所以能够取得这样伟大的胜利，首先是由于朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军之间的紧密团结与战斗友谊的不断增进。朝中人民部队在紧密协同作战中所表现的兄弟般的友爱精神，有着不可胜数的可歌可泣的事迹。这种友爱更加巩固了两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊和团结。同时，朝中两国人民为反抗美国侵略、保卫自己祖国、维护东方与世界和平而进行的正义的共同斗争也是朝中人民部队在前线取得一个接一个辉煌胜利的有力保障。
    在朝鲜战场上流血斗争的英雄的中国人民志愿军，是崇高的国际主义精神的化身。朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军有着无限的热爱、尊敬与感激。
    朝鲜人民亲眼看到和亲身体会了受到伟大的毛泽东主席教导的中国人民志愿军对朝鲜人民的无限热爱与对敌人的无限憎恨。中国人民志愿军奋不顾身地从美国野兽的血爪中，拯救了朝鲜的男女老幼。而他们对朝鲜人民的那种谦逊亲切和秋毫无犯，使得朝鲜人民更加提高了对于伟大的毛泽东主席和在毛泽东旗帜下进行轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动的中国人民的感激和崇敬。
    在过去的一年中，朝中两国人民为进一步加强与巩固两国人民之间的友谊团结，已做了许多有历史意义的工作。中国人民不仅派遣了自己的优秀儿女到朝鲜战场来和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，而且还屡次派遣了由各界人民代表组成的慰问团，到朝鲜前线与后方慰问朝鲜军民。更派遣了大批运输队、担架队、医疗队，到朝鲜的前后方来进行忘我的斗争。中国人民在过去的一年中赠送给朝鲜人民的救济金达一千数百亿元，慰问品一百数十万件，慰问袋八十余万个，及其他各种援助物资。这一切都大大地鼓舞了我们朝鲜军民抗美战争的胜利信心。使朝中两国人民之间的友谊团结更加巩固起来了。这种友谊团结乃是保证我们共同胜利的绝大力量。曾经参加过中国革命斗争的朝鲜爱国志士，有不少人以自己的生命实现了革命的信念——中国人民革命的胜利，就是朝鲜人民的胜利。去年“八、一五”来朝鲜参加朝鲜解放五周年庆祝典礼的中国人民代表团团长郭沫若先生，曾向朝鲜人民传达了中国人民的革命信念——朝鲜人民的胜利，就是中国人民的胜利。中国人民志愿军的志愿入朝作战，更进一步证明了朝中两国人民唇齿相依的亲密关系与牢不可破的深厚友谊。
    今天，朝中两国人民的战斗友谊与团结一致所发挥的英雄主义精神，给世界人民做出了国际主义的榜样。一年来的经验证明：任何暴力也不能摧毁朝中两国人民的友谊、团结，更不能阻挡朝中两国人民共同胜利的到来。
