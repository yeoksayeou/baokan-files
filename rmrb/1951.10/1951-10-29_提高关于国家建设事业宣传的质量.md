The People's Republic of China has only been established for a little over two years, but the People's Government has already accomplished many significant tasks and achieved great success in various construction endeavors. Many of the construction projects undertaken in these two years are unprecedented in China's history and were completely unimaginable in old China. These great achievements have not only improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people but also concretely demonstrate the superiority of the New Democratic system. The people have reason to foresee, based on these facts, how our country's face will be changed and how brilliant our country's prospects will be when even greater construction projects are launched in the future.

However, the quality and quantity of newspaper publicity regarding national construction projects in various regions still have shortcomings. Newspaper publicity has not fully and essentially demonstrated the achievements of these construction projects. Overcoming these shortcomings and improving the quality of publicity regarding national construction projects is now a matter of urgency.

It is worth noting that many newspapers have not given sufficient attention to important national construction projects and have not provided full and complete reports. Take the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as an example. This is an important railway that had been talked about for forty-four years from the late Qing Dynasty to the Kuomintang rule but was never built. Construction began as soon as Sichuan was liberated. This one event vividly illustrates the essential difference between new China and old China. However, many newspapers did not give this major event the attention it deserved. The Xinhua News Agency's July 4th news release about the Chongqing-Yongchuan section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway opening to traffic on July 1st this year was not published by the Northeast Daily, Xi'an Masses Daily, or Changjiang Daily, all newspapers at the Great Administrative Area level. The Northeast Daily and Xi'an Masses Daily also did not publish the news that the Chongqing-Yongchuan section began operations on September 1st. In terms of epidemic prevention and health, 170 million people across the country have been vaccinated against smallpox this year, no cases of cholera have been found for three years, and the plague, which has plagued Fujian for more than a decade, has not occurred this year. These are unprecedented achievements in Chinese history. A few newspapers, such as the Shanghai Liberation Daily, carried out publicity on this aspect, but newspapers in various regions generally publicized these achievements very little. There are many similar examples, showing that newspapers in various regions lack due attention to national construction work.

Some newspapers have not even provided timely and sufficient publicity for important local construction projects. Northeast China began a huge plan this year to build the West Manchurian Protective Forest Belt. Although this plan is far from comparable to the Soviet Union's Stalin Plan for transforming nature, no other country in the world is carrying out such a great project, and no country other than one ruled by the people can carry out such a plan. The first part of this project was completed in May this year. Regarding this project, the Northeast Daily only published two news items on March 28th and June 17th of this year, that is, at the beginning and completion of the first part of the project. It was not until August 20th that it published Zhang Qingtai's report, which detailed the full picture of the plan and its great significance, and combined it with articles introducing the Soviet Union's protective forest plan to form a powerful publicity campaign. In fact, such publicity is equally important at the beginning of the project. The Guoqianqi Irrigation Area in Jilin Province is one of the four major irrigation areas in Northeast China and is an area cultivated by machines. This project released water on June 20th this year, and the Northeast Daily reported it on July 10th, while the Jilin Daily only reprinted the Northeast Daily's news on July 14th. The opening of the Liuzhou-Nanning section of the Xiang-Gui Railway is the greatest achievement in railway construction in Central and Southern China. The Liuzhou-Laibin section was a restoration of the old road, while the Laibin-Nanning section was newly built. The Changjiang Daily only published a 500-word news item about the success of this important construction project on March 16th. When the Chongqing-Yongchuan section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway began operations, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily carried out a powerful publicity campaign. It is conceivable that the people of Chengdu and Western Sichuan are also closely concerned about this matter, but the Western Sichuan Daily only published the news broadcast by the Xinhua News Agency and did not have any material showing local characteristics.

The above examples are sufficient to illustrate that our newspapers do not pay enough attention to the publicity of important national construction projects, and these publicity efforts do not occupy enough space in the newspapers. Therefore, although the government has done many good things for the people and national construction has made great progress in a short period of two years, the people cannot fully learn about these from the newspapers. After the Soviet press announced the great construction plans of the Kubyshev and Stalingrad Hydropower Stations, the Turkmen Canal, etc., they quickly launched publicity on the significance of these great constructions from all aspects. Although the construction projects currently underway in our country are far from comparable to the Soviet Union's communist construction in terms of scale, nature, and planning, it is equally important to be able to carry out such construction under the current conditions in China. We should learn from the spirit of the Soviet press in attaching importance to the publicity of national construction projects.

In the past two years, there have also been some important shortcomings in the quality of newspaper publicity regarding national construction projects. The most important of these is that more publicity has been given to the huge economic benefits that can be obtained after the completion of these constructions, while not enough publicity has been given to the political significance. There has been a lack of attention to strengthening the people's patriotic education and education on the socialist future through these vivid facts. This is a noteworthy and common phenomenon. Some newspapers even emphasized the secondary significance of these undertakings and weakened the main significance in their reports. For example, the Western Sichuan Daily carried out some publicity on the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, but a large part of it reported on unemployed workers participating in the construction. The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway did play a great role in relieving unemployed workers, but compared with the overall political and economic significance, this was ultimately secondary. In the past six months, newspapers have begun to pay attention to this issue and have made some preliminary improvements, but it is still far from sufficient.

Secondly, in the publicity of these important constructions, not enough publicity has been given to the leading role of the Party. Generally, only abstract concepts such as "under the leadership of the Party" and "under the influence of the exemplary role of Party members" are mentioned in news reports, and there are very few concrete and vivid explanations. The Liberation Daily has conducted planned reports on the harnessing of the Huai River and has achieved great results, but it has not done much publicity on how the Party has played its leading role in the various levels of organizations of the Huai River harnessing project and how the Party's grassroots organizations have united and educated the masses to jointly complete the tasks. In the Huai River harnessing publicity, the Northern Anhui Daily has reported extensively on the glorious deeds of model laborers for a year (which is naturally necessary), but it has given very little publicity to the leading role of Party organizations and outstanding Party members. The praise of model laborers' behavior has mostly emphasized their individual roles in isolation and ignored the collective strength of the masses and the Party's long-term education of the laborers. The Northern Anhui Daily has already pointed this out in its book review column. In addition, many projects are built with the participation of the People's Liberation Army, or with the People's Liberation Army as the main force. The Xinjiang Daily and Chongqing Xinhua Daily have focused on publicizing this aspect. However, some newspapers have not paid attention to the role of the People's Liberation Army. Several important projects in Hebei Province, such as the Jinmen Canal and the Chaobai River project, have been participated in by the People's Liberation Army. The Hebei Daily only simply mentioned the words "military workers" in its reports. If you are not careful, readers may not even know that the People's Liberation Army participated. Due to this negligence, the Hebei Daily has not been able to use these concrete and vivid facts to publicize the noble qualities of the people's army and educate the people to love the People's Liberation Army.

It is also not easy to see the people's enthusiastic response to these major construction projects from the newspapers. Apart from adding abstract praises such as "the masses praised endlessly" and "enthusiastically support" in the news reports, very few readers' letters of this kind are selected and published in some newspapers. Since the government has done so many good things for the people, the people's gratitude goes without saying. The lack of reflection on this aspect in the newspapers should be said to be a negligence on the part of the editorial department.

The failure to adequately publicize important national construction projects cannot be attributed to the local nature of the newspapers. Although some construction projects are not directly related to certain regions, these facts should be widely publicized throughout the country. The importance of central work and current affairs publicity cannot be a reason for not publicizing national construction projects, because building our new country is one of our main tasks and the ultimate goal of all central work, and important construction projects are the most important current affairs. Newspapers should change their attitude of not caring enough about important national construction projects, improve the quality and quantity of this publicity, so that the people of the whole country can fully see the continuous development of our great motherland from the newspapers. Such publicity will undoubtedly increase the people's patriotic enthusiasm and work enthusiasm a hundredfold, and will educate the people to see the New Democratic today and the socialist tomorrow of our country from various living facts, and move forward more bravely, resolutely, and confidently.

### 提高关于国家建设事业宣传的质量

    提高关于国家建设事业宣传的质量
    中华人民共和国成立虽然还只有两年多，人民政府却已经办了许多大事，在各种建设事业上取得了很大的成绩。这两年中已经进行了的一些建设，有许多是我国历史上空前的，是在旧中国完全不可以想像的。这些伟大的成绩不仅已使亿万人民因此改善了他们的生活，而且也具体地说明了新民主主义制度的优越性。人民有理由根据这些事实预见出在未来的更伟大的建设工作展开以后，将怎样改变我们国家的面貌，显示出我们国家的灿烂远景。
    然而各地报纸关于国家建设事业的宣传无论是质量和数量都还有缺点。报纸的宣传还没有充分地和本质地表现出这些建设事业的成就。克服这种缺点，提高关于国家建设事业宣传的质量，已经是刻不容缓的了。
    值得我们注意的是有不少报纸对于具有重要意义的国家建设事业没有予以足够的重视，没有进行充分的完整的报道。以成渝铁路为例，这是一条从清末到国民党统治时代闹了四十四年都没有修成的重要铁路，在四川刚一解放的时候便开工兴筑了。仅这一件事就生动地说明了新中国和旧中国的本质上的不同。但是许多报纸对于这样一件大事没有予以应有的重视。新华社七月四日播出的成渝铁路重庆永川段今年七月一日通车的新闻，在大行政区一级的报纸中，东北日报、西安群众日报、长江日报都没有发表。九月一日重庆永川段开始营业的新闻，东北日报和西安群众日报也没有发表。又如在防疫卫生事业上，今年全国已有一亿七千万人口种了牛痘，霍乱病例已有三年未发现，十余年来为患福建从未中断的鼠疫今年没有发生。这是中国历史上前所未见的成绩，少数报纸如上海解放日报作了关于这一方面的宣传，但各地报纸一般对于这一方面的成绩宣传得都很少。类似的例子很多，可见各地报纸对于国家的建设工作缺乏应有的注意。
    有些报纸甚至对当地的重要建设事业都没有及时地进行充分的宣传。东北从今年开始了建设西满防护林带的巨大计划，这个计划与苏联的斯大林改造自然计划相较虽然相去尚远，但全世界却没有别的国家进行这样伟大的工程，而且除了人民当权的国家之外，任何国家也不可能进行这样的计划。这个工程的第一部分已于今年五月完成。关于这个工程，东北日报仅在今年三月二十八日和六月十七日，即在第一部分工程开始时和完成时发表了两则新闻，到了八月二十日才发表了张庆泰的报道，详细地说明了这个计划的全貌和它的伟大的意义，配合介绍苏联防护林计划的文章，组成了有力的宣传。事实上，这样的宣传在工程开始的时候也是同样重要的。吉林省郭前旗灌溉区是东北四大灌溉区之一，而且是用机器耕种的地区，这一工程今年六月二十日放水，东北日报七月十日加以报道，而吉林日报却只在七月十四日才转载东北日报的消息。湘桂铁路柳州到南宁段通车，是中南铁路建设上的最大成就，其中柳州到来宾段为旧道修复，来宾到南宁则是新修的，这个重要的建设事业的成功，长江日报只在三月十六日发表了一条五百字的新闻。成渝铁路重庆永川段开始营业时，重庆新华日报作了有力的宣传。可以想见，成都和川西人民对这件事也是密切关怀的，但川西日报却只发表了新华社所播的新闻，没有一点表现地方色彩的材料。
    以上的例证足以说明，我们的报纸对于重要国家建设事业的宣传是不够重视的，这些宣传在报纸上没有占据足够的地位。因此，虽然在短短的两年中，政府已为人民做了许多好事，国家建设有了很大的进步，但人民还不能从报纸上充分知道这些。苏联报刊在苏联政府宣布了建设古比雪夫、斯大林格勒水电站，土库曼运河等伟大建设计划之后，迅速地从各方面展开了关于这些伟大建设的意义的宣传。我国现在进行的建设事业虽然在规模、性质和计划性上都还远不能与苏联的共产主义建设相比拟，但在中国现时的条件下就能进行这样的建设，其意义是同样重要的。我们应该学习苏联报刊重视宣传国家建设事业的精神。
    这两年中报纸关于国家建设事业的宣传，在质上也有一些重要的缺点。其中最主要的是对于这些建设完成后经济上可以获得的巨大收益宣传得较多，而政治意义宣传得不够，没有注意通过这些活生生的事实加强人民群众的爱国主义教育和社会主义前途的教育。这是值得注意的较普遍的现象。有的报纸在报道上甚至强调了这些事业的次要意义削弱了主要意义。例如关于修筑成渝铁路，川西日报进行了一些宣传，但其中较大的一部分是报道失业工人参加筑路的。成渝铁路的修筑在救济失业工人上确起了很大的作用，但比起整个的政治意义和经济意义来说，这究竟是次要的了。近半年来，报纸对于这个问题开始重视，有了一些初步的改进，但仍很不充分。
    其次，在这些重要建设的宣传中，对于党的领导作用宣传得不够。一般地只是在新闻报道中抽象地提到一些“在党的领导之下”，“在党员模范作用影响之下”等概念，而很少具体生动的说明。解放日报关于治淮进行了有计划的报道，有很大的成绩，但对于党在治淮工程的各级组织中曾怎样发挥了他们的领导作用，党的基层组织如何团结教育群众共同完成任务，却没有进行多少宣传。皖北日报在治淮宣传中，一年来大量地报道了民工模范的光辉行为（这自然是必要的），而对党组织和优秀党员的领导作用却宣传得很少。对于民工模范行为的表扬，又多半孤立地强调了他们个人的作用而忽视了群众的集体力量和党对民工们的长期教育。对这一点，皖北日报在书报评论栏中已经指出。此外，有许多工程是有人民解放军参加修建，或以人民解放军为主力修建的。对于这一方面，新疆日报和重庆新华日报等曾着重宣传。但有一些报纸对人民解放军的作用没有加以重视。河北省的几个重要工程如金门渠、潮白河工程等都有人民解放军参加，河北日报在报道中却只简单地提到“军工”等字样，稍不留意甚至会使读者还不知道有人民解放军参加。由于这种疏忽，河北日报就没有能够用这些具体生动的事实宣传人民军队的高尚品质和教育人民热爱解放军。
    从报纸上也不容易看出人民对这些重大的建设事业的热烈反应。有些报纸上除了在新闻报道中加上了“群众称道不绝”，“热烈拥护”一类的抽象赞语之外，很少看到选刊这一类的读者来信。政府既然为人民办了这样多的好事，人民的感念是不待言的。报纸缺少这方面的反映，应该说是编辑部的一个疏忽。
    对于重要的国家建设事业没有作足够的宣传不能归因于报纸的地方性，有些建设事业虽然与某些地区没有直接的关系，但这些事实原是应该向全国广泛宣传的。中心工作和时事宣传的重要性不能成为不宣传国家建设事业的理由，因为建设我们的新国家便是我们的主要工作之一和一切中心工作的最终目的，而重要建设事业也就是最重要的时事。报纸应该改变对于重要的国家建设事业不够关心的态度，提高这种宣传的质和量，使全国人民能从报纸上全面地看到我们伟大祖国的不断的发展。这样的宣传无疑地会百倍地增强人民爱国主义的热情和工作的积极性，会教育人民从各种活生生的事实中看出我国新民主主义的今天和社会主义的明天，而更勇敢坚决、信心充沛地向前迈进。
