Workers Display High Enthusiasm and Creativity in Patriotic Production Competition
Some Factories in Tianjin Can Now Manufacture Various Important Machines Themselves
    Tianjin workers and technicians, in the patriotic labor competition, have displayed high patriotic zeal, improved technology, and demonstrated creative talents, achieving significant results. Workers at the Tianjin Automobile Parts Factory successfully trial-produced a four-cylinder engine, pioneering the path for China's self-manufacture of internal combustion engines. Workers at the Trolleybus Company Repair Factory successfully trial-produced a trolleybus, and the factory has become China's first trolleybus manufacturer. Workers at the Textile Machinery Factory successfully self-manufactured roving frame flyers, creating extremely important conditions for the development of China's textile industry. Workers at the Tianjin Machine Factory successfully self-manufactured mobile high-speed diesel engines and air compressors, creating important conditions for China's self-manufacture of industrial and mining equipment. Xiaozhan Farm successfully modified engines to use calcium carbide instead of diesel, saving considerable fuel costs for rural areas. Tianjin Paper Mill Branch successfully self-manufactured insulating paper, and China's electrical industry can now self-manufacture insulating paper. In addition, the private Zhongtian Electrical Machinery Factory successfully self-manufactured a 500-line automatic switching machine, and the Zhonghua Oils and Fats Factory successfully self-manufactured hard butter, both of which are valuable achievements.
    The achievements created by Tianjin workers are all the result of displaying high patriotic enthusiasm, utilizing existing equipment, and overcoming various difficulties. Trolleybuses manufactured by workers at the Trolleybus Company Repair Factory were previously impossible to manufacture domestically, but under the encouragement of patriotic enthusiasm, the factory's workers finally overcame many difficulties and successfully manufactured them themselves.
    The four-cylinder engine manufactured by the Tianjin Automobile Parts Factory was also previously impossible to produce domestically. When the factory director announced the manufacture of the four-cylinder engine to all employees, most employees patted their chests and said, "The imperialists look down on us; we will let them see the strength of our working class." Although there were five failures during the trial production process, with the encouragement of the Party, administration, and trade union, they finally succeeded. Before the Tianjin Machine Factory trial-produced the 100-horsepower diesel engine and air compressor, they first had to make a half-ton crankshaft. However, the forging department only had a half-ton steam hammer, and some workers said, "How can a half-ton steam hammer forge a half-ton crankshaft?" The creative power of the Chinese working class is unlimited. As a result, the half-ton crankshaft was finally forged with the half-ton steam hammer. The close combination of technicians' theories and workers' practical experience is one of the important reasons for the success of these creations.
    When the Tianjin Machine Factory was trial-producing fuel injectors and fuel pumps, the ten-millimeter reamed hole on the fuel pump sleeve was always not smooth. Engineer Hong Baoshun and fitter Liu Fengqi, lathe operator Zhang Zhaoqi, and others repeatedly studied the problem. Workers suggested using soapy water instead of lubricant, and the engineer theoretically considered it feasible. After the change, the workers tested it again, and the result was that the hole's smoothness reached the standard specifications.
    Currently, Tianjin's workers have launched a mass technical learning upsurge to strive for further improvement of production technology. (Wu Fang)

    工人在爱国生产竞赛中发挥高度积极性创造性
    天津有些工厂已能自制多种重要机器
    天津市工人及技术人员在爱国主义劳动竞赛中，发挥了高度爱国热忱，改进技术，发挥创造才能，有重大成绩。天津汽车制配厂职工试制四缸引擎成功，开创了我国自造内燃机的道路。电车公司修理厂职工试制无轨电车成功，该厂已成为我国第一个无轨电车制造厂。纺织机械厂工人自制粗纱机锭翼成功，为我国纺织工业的发展，创造了极重要的条件。天津机器厂职工自制移动式高速柴油机与空气压缩机成功，为我国自制工矿设备创造了重要的条件。小站农场改装电石代替柴油的发动机成功，为农村动力燃料节省了很大的费用。天津造纸分厂自制绝缘纸成功，我国电器工业用的绝缘纸，从此可以自制了。此外，私营中天电机厂自制五百门自动变换机成功，中华油脂厂自制硬黄油成功，都是很有价值的成就。
    天津市职工创造的这些成绩，都是发挥高度的爱国热情，利用现有的设备，克服了种种困难获得的。电车公司修理厂职工所制造的无轨电车，过去国内根本不能制造，但该厂职工在爱国热情鼓舞下，终于克服许多困难，自制成功。
    天津汽车制配厂制造的四缸引擎，过去国内也是不能生产的。该厂厂长向全体职工宣布制造四缸引擎时，大多数职工拍着胸脯说：“帝国主义看不起我们，我们要让它们看看我们工人阶级的力量。”在试制过程中，虽然失败了五次，但在党、行政、工会的鼓励下，最后终于成功。天津机器厂试制一百马力柴油机及空气压缩机前，必须先制成半吨重的拐轴。但是，锻工部只有一个半吨重的汽锤，有的工人就说：“半吨重的汽锤打半吨重的拐轴，这怎么能行呢？”中国工人阶级的创造力量是无限的，结果，半吨重的拐轴，终于用半吨重的汽锤打出来了。技术人员的理论与工人的实际经验密切结合，是这些创造能够成功的重要原因之一。
    天津机器厂试制油嘴油泵时，油泵套上的十毫米铰眼总不光滑；工程师洪宝顺和钳工刘凤岐、车工张兆起等七人反覆研究，工人提出以肥皂水代替滑剂，工程师从理论上认为可行；改换之后，再由工人试验，结果使铰眼光度达到规格标准。
    目前天津市的职工展开了群众性的技术学习热潮，为进一步改进生产技术而斗争。  （吴方）
