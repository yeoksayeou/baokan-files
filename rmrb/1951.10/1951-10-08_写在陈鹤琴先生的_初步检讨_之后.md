Written After Mr. Chen Heqin's "Preliminary Self-Criticism"
    Liu Shi

    We welcome Mr. Chen Heqin's "preliminary self-criticism" of "Living Education."

    Mr. Chen has shown a sincere and serious attitude towards this criticism and his own self-criticism, which is what correct criticism and self-criticism require. This spirit should be developed into a new trend in the education field.

    Currently, the ideological criticism of "Living Education" is only just beginning. Because Comrade Zhang Lingguang and others' critical articles can only be regarded as an introduction to the criticism of "Living Education," and the problems touched upon are only a few basic viewpoints of "Living Education." "Living Education" is not only a theory, but also has actions. If the criticism is not combined with the entire practice of "Living Education," then the criticism will fall into one-sidedness, and it will not be possible to make a correct theoretical criticism of "Living Education." This work still needs us to continue to do.

    Similarly, Mr. Chen's "preliminary self-criticism" mainly focuses on the scope of the questions raised by the critics, and naturally has not comprehensively and specifically combined with Mr. Chen's decades of educational work practice. Other members of the "Living Education Society" have not yet had time to express their opinions. Therefore, this also shows that self-criticism needs to continue to deepen.

    In order to make both criticism and self-criticism develop correctly, I would like to put forward the following points for reference.

    I believe that both criticism and self-criticism should not be limited to the rhetoric of "Living Education," and the focus should be on its practice, and not only limited to the practice after the banner of "Living Education" was raised, or a certain stage of practice; it should include Mr. Chen Heqin's entire educational activities. Mr. Chen's educational activities have three central parts. One is the Nanjing Gulou Kindergarten, which was the first in China to experiment with Dewey's theory; the second is the eight elementary schools and one girls' middle school in the Shanghai Public Concession that were run for "Chinese" under the direct leadership of imperialism; and the third is the activities after the banner of "Living Education" was raised. These three parts of activities are interconnected and inseparable, and their educational thoughts are concentratedly expressed in the theoretical system of "Living Education." We must study the educational practice of these three parts in order to make a due systematic criticism of "Living Education." Only by seriously examining these aspects can Mr. Chen and the "Living Education Society" comprehensively examine their work and make correct conclusions about their work and thoughts.

    I think the best way to conduct criticism and self-criticism correctly in the future is to learn the method created by "The Investigation of Wu Xun's History." That is, to conduct specific investigation and research work in an organized and planned manner with a strict scientific attitude. The Gulou Kindergarten is still led by Mr. Chen; although those few Municipal Council schools have belonged to the municipal government under the leadership of the People's Government since liberation, most of the original teaching staff are still teaching. The investigation work is not difficult to carry out; the investigation and research work during the "Living Education" period—from Jiangxi to Shanghai—is easier to carry out. As for how to do it in a planned way, that is another question. We hope that Mr. Chen and other members of the "Living Education Society" will automatically use the spirit of self-examination to do this inspection work, and can obtain the leadership of the education departments of the East China and Central South administrative regions, the cultural and education bureaus of Shanghai and Nanjing, and the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education to do this together. I think this will be of great benefit to Mr. Chen, the "Living Education Society," and other people engaged in people's education work.

    写在陈鹤琴先生的“初步检讨”之后
    柳湜
    我们欢迎陈鹤琴先生对“活教育”的“初步检讨”。
    陈先生对这次批评和对自己的检讨，都表现了诚恳和严肃的态度，这是正确的批评与自我批评所需要的，这种精神应该在教育界发展成为一种新的风气。
    目前对“活教育”的思想批评，还仅在开始。因为张凌光同志等的批评文章，只能算是对“活教育”批评的引子，所触到的问题还只是“活教育”的几个基本观点。“活教育”不仅是一种理论，而是有行动的。如果批评不结合“活教育”的全部实践，那末批评就会陷于片面性，并且也不能对“活教育”作出正确的理论的批判的。这工作还要我们继续来做。
    同样，陈先生的“初步检讨”，主要的也仅仅针对批评者所提出问题的范围，自然还没有全面地具体地结合陈先生数十年的教育工作实践的。“活教育社”其他的人，也还未来得及发表意见。因此，这也表现了在自我批评方面还需要继续深入下去。
    为了使批评与自我批评两方面都正确地向前发展，我提出以下几点意见以供参考。
    我以为无论批评与自我批评都不应限于“活教育”的言论，重点应在它的实践，而且不仅限于“活教育”旗帜打出以后，或某一阶段的实践；应是包括陈鹤琴先生的整个教育活动。陈先生的教育活动有三个中心部分。一是中国首先实验杜威学说的南京鼓楼幼稚园；二是上海公共租界在帝国主义直接领导下为“华人”而办的八个小学，一个女中；三是“活教育”旗帜打出以后的活动。这三部分活动是互相联系不可分离的，其教育思想集中表现在“活教育”的理论体系上。必须研究这三部分的教育实践，我们才能对“活教育”作出应有的系统批判。陈先生和“活教育社”也只有这样认真地检讨这几方面，才能算全面地检讨了自己的工作，才能对自己的工作和思想作出正确的结论。
    今后正确地进行批评与自我批评的方法，我以为最好不过的是学习“武训历史调查记”所创造的方法。即抱着严格的科学态度，有组织有计划地进行具体的调查研究工作。鼓楼幼稚园，至今还是由陈先生所领导的；那几个工部局学校，虽然解放后已经是属于人民政府领导下的市立学校了，但原有的教职员尚大多仍在任教，调查工作都不是很难进行的；“活教育”时期——从江西到上海——的调查研究工作就更容易进行。至于如何有计划地来做，那是另一问题。我们希望陈先生及“活教育社”其他的人自动地用自我检讨的精神来作这项检查工作，并可取得华东、中南两大行政区教育部，上海、南京两市文教局，江西省文教厅的领导，协同来做这件事。我想，这是对陈先生、“活教育社”以及其他从事人民教育工作的人们都是有很大益处的。
