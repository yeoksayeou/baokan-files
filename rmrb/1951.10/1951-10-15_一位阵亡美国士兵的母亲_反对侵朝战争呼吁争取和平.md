    Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: According to TASS, New York, October 12th: The American Progressive Party's organ, "National Guardian" weekly, published a letter from a resident of Dawson Springs, Tennessee, named Tipton, calling on the American people to unite and strive for peace.
    Tipton wrote in the letter that her only son, who had participated in World War II, had been killed in Korea. She said angrily: "How many American mothers have encountered this terrible tragedy. Heartless beasts have caused this terrible tragedy to every peace-loving person in our country. Those beasts tell us that our children died for democracy. But how can a country that is threatening other countries with atomic bombs and all kinds of other killing weapons have peace? ... We, the Tipton family, and thousands upon thousands of other families, are in the same grief. I contemplate: What a terrible sin it is for our sons to receive weapons and be forced to go seven thousand miles away to slaughter the parents and children of other countries and burn down their houses."
    Tipton called on the American people to work together for peace. She cried out: "If the American people do not work together for peace, we will never get peace, and MacArthur's son will send your son to his death in the future, just as his father has sent my son to his death. No matter what race we belong to or what beliefs we hold, we must unite together. ... The people need peace. But those who make fortunes from war are war traffickers ... Because we are only doing our part as guests and not on the field, terrible misfortune has befallen us. Now, let us all work together."

    一位阵亡美国士兵的母亲
    反对侵朝战争呼吁争取和平
     【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约十二日讯：美国进步党机关刊物“国民前卫”周刊登载田纳西州道孙德城一个名叫提普吞的居民的来信，号召美国老百姓团结起来争取和平。
    提普吞在信中写道：她的参加过第二次世界大战的独子，已在朝鲜阵亡了。她愤激地说：“美国有多少母亲遭遇到这种可怕的悲剧啊。没有心肝的畜生使我国每一个爱好和平的人都遭遇到这种可怕的悲剧，那些畜生对我们说：我们的孩子是为民主而死。但是，一个正用原子弹以及所有各种其他杀人武器威胁其他国家的国家，怎么能有和平呢？……我们，提普吞一家，以及千千万万的其他家庭，都处于同样的悲哀之中。我沉思默想：我们的儿子们接到武器，被迫到七千哩外的地方去屠杀他国人民的父母和儿女，并且烧掉他们的家屋，这对他们说来是一种多么可怕的罪恶啊。”
    提普吞号召美国人民共同争取和平，她大声疾呼地说：“如果美国的老百姓不共同努力争取和平，我们就永远得不到和平，而麦克阿瑟的儿子将来也会把你们的儿子送到死路上去，正像他的老子已把我的儿子送到死路上去一样。不管我们是属于什么种族，抱着什么信仰，我们必须团结在一起。……人民需要和平。但是，靠战争发财的那些人是战争贩子……由于我们只是做着客而不是上场的人，才让可怕的不幸降临到我们的身上。现在，让我们大家共同努力罢。”
