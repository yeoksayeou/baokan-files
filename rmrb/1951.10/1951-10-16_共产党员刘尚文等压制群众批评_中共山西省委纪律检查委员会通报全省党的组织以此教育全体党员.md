    Communist Party Members Liu Shangwen and Others Suppress Mass Criticism
    The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC Notifies Party Organizations Throughout the Province to Educate All Party Members
    In some areas of Shanxi Province, the undesirable phenomenon of some cadres suppressing criticism and adopting a retaliatory attitude towards critics still exists seriously. Recently, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC notified Party organizations throughout the province about the erroneous behaviors of Liu Shangwen, the Organization Minister of the CPC Yu County Committee, and Li Weiyuan, the Deputy Director of the Changzhi County Public Security Bureau and a Communist Party member, who suppressed democracy and retaliated against critics, in order to educate all Party members.

    The notification stated that Wang Chengrong, a Communist Party member of Xiliang Village in the Seventh District of Yu County, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to file a complaint because he disagreed with the disciplinary action of being placed on probation within the Party given to him by the local Party committee. At the same time, he exposed the illegal and undisciplined behavior, corruption, and dereliction of duty of certain Party members, the factionalism within the branch, and the one-sided views of certain county and district cadres in handling this issue, which resulted in a blurred line between the enemy and ourselves, allowing reactionary landlords and rich peasants, as well as returning enemy and puppet personnel, to take the opportunity to counterattack the peasants. After investigation by the Provincial Committee and the Prefectural Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, most of the facts revealed by Wang Chengrong were found to be true. However, Liu Shangwen, the Organization Minister of the Yu County Committee, believed that "Wang Chengrong's complaint was insisting on his own mistakes." Therefore, he first completely denied the facts Wang Chengrong had accused at the Xiliang Village branch meeting, saying, "None of it is true, it's all slander." He then used the excuse that "Wang Chengrong did not admit his mistakes but instead slandered others" to pass a resolution at the branch meeting to expel Wang Chengrong from the Party (Liu Shangwen also approved it on behalf of the County Committee). At the same time, he suggested that the government should impose legal sanctions on Wang Chengrong. Subsequently, Liu Shangwen convened a mass meeting to encourage the masses to "struggle" against Wang Chengrong. After the "struggle," village cadres sent Wang Chengrong to the district government and detained him, using torture to force him to confess "who told you to appeal." He was also deprived of food for two days. Later, Wang Chengrong was escorted to the county government. The County Judicial Section continued to use coercive methods to pursue Wang Chengrong's so-called "slanderous" motives and his mastermind. During Wang Chengrong's detention in the county government, the county government even imprisoned him in the same cell with counter-revolutionary criminals and handcuffed him when he went out. The county government and the county committee turned a blind eye to the counterattack of reactionary landlords and rich peasants against the peasants in Xiliang Village. At this time, the peasant Wang Lianshou complained to the Shanxi Daily about the counterattack of reactionary landlords and rich peasants against the peasants in Xiliang Village, and reported the above-mentioned incidents to the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Provincial Committee. However, Wang Lianshou was also detained upon his return. After the Yu County Committee and Liu Shangwen saw the criticism in the Shanxi Daily, they continued to suppress mass criticism and continued to condone the landlord's counterattack in Xiliang Village. It was not until the Provincial Committee and the Prefectural Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission pointed out that this was a manifestation of blurring the line between the enemy and ourselves that the Yu County Committee advocated releasing Wang Lianshou and mobilizing the masses to fight against reactionary landlords and rich peasants. At the same time, they expressed their intention to release Wang Chengrong. A month later, when the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Provincial Committee sent people to Yu County for a second inspection, Wang Chengrong was still being detained. The County Party Secretary Rong Xiangde even said, "This is the demand of the masses." (?) As a result, Wang Chengrong was detained for as long as three months.

    The incident of Liu Shangwen, the Organization Minister of the Yu County Committee (not just Liu Shangwen alone, County Party Secretary Rong Xiangde and others should also be included - editor), suppressing criticism has left an extremely bad impression on the masses. The masses said: "Wang Chengrong was detained because he appealed." And some people wrongly advised Wang Chengrong: "You can't do this again, the province can't always be watching you, the province can't do without the county and district at any time."

    The notification then narrated the erroneous behavior of Li Weiyuan, the Deputy Director of the Changzhi County Public Security Bureau and a Communist Party member, in suppressing criticism. Fan Yin'an, a Party member cadre of the bureau, saw that the bureau had violated the national financial system and falsely reported allowances and other illegal behaviors, and immediately reported and exposed them to the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Changzhi Prefectural Committee. After an on-site inspection by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee, it was proved that the accusation was a fact, and it was decided to deal with it.

    After receiving the notice from the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Changzhi Prefectural Committee ordering him to conduct an inspection, Li Weiyuan, the Deputy Director of the Changzhi County Public Security Bureau, said: "This grain was eaten by the team members, it wasn't embezzled by me personally!" and refused to inspect. After repeated urging by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee, Li Weiyuan, on the one hand, tried to reduce his mistakes by reporting fewer allowances than he actually received, changing ten months of empty quotas to three months; on the other hand, he actively collected Fan Yin'an's shortcomings and erroneous facts, exaggerating them out of thin air, to achieve the purpose of retaliation. At the same time, he also asked the Changzhi Prefectural Administrative Office of Public Security to transfer Fan Yin'an's work, and threatened his superiors, saying: "If Fan Yin'an's problem is not dealt with, he and the section chiefs will collectively resign." The Changzhi Prefectural Administrative Office of Public Security stopped Fan Yin'an's work without analysis and transferred Fan Yin'an back to the Public Security Office for reflection. Later, because Li Weiyuan was transferred to the Provincial Administrative Cadre School to study, this issue was delayed for more than four months without a solution. It was not until it was discovered by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee that a final decision was made.

    The notification pointed out: Wang Chengrong and Fan Yin'an's complaints were in line with the interests of the Party and were completely legitimate and proper behaviors. However, Liu Shangwen, Li Weiyuan, and others treated such serious issues with a bureaucratic and liberal attitude and adopted barbaric retaliatory measures against the complainants. This is a complete violation of the Party's democratic principles and self-criticism style and is a matter of principle. In addition to giving Li Weiyuan a public warning within the Party, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee also suggested that the Changzhi Prefectural Administrative Office seriously deal with the issue of the Changzhi County Public Security Bureau eating empty quotas. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shanxi Provincial Committee has ordered Liu Shangwen and the Yu County Committee to conduct strict self-criticism for their mistakes and intends to give them appropriate punishment.

    共产党员刘尚文等压制群众批评
    中共山西省委纪律检查委员会通报全省党的组织以此教育全体党员
    山西省某些地区某些干部压制批评，对批评者采取打击、报复态度的不良现象仍严重地存在着。最近中共山西省委纪律检查委员会，将中共盂县县委组织部长刘尚文、长治县公安局副局长、共产党员李维垣，压制民主、对批评者施行报复的错误行为，通报全省党的组织，以教育全体党员。
    通报说，盂县七区西梁村共产党员王承荣，因不服当地党委给他的留党察看的处分，给毛主席写信，提出控诉。同时他揭发了某些党员违法乱纪、贪污失职、支部闹宗派与某些县区干部在处理这一问题时的片面观点，以及因此造成敌我界线不分，反动的地主和富农以及敌伪还乡人员乃趁机向农民反攻的事情。王承荣所揭发的事实，经省委、地委纪律检查委员会的检查，大部属实。但盂县县委组织部长刘尚文却认为：“王承荣的控诉是坚持自己的错误。”因而首先在西梁村支部大会上，完全否定了王承荣所控告的事实，他说：“没有一条是真的，完全是诬告。”又以“王承荣不承认错误，反而诬告别人”等为藉口，在支部大会上通过开除王承荣党籍的决议（刘尚文并代表县委会批准）。同时建议政府应给王承荣以法律制裁。接着，刘尚文召开群众大会，鼓动群众“斗争”王承荣。“斗争”后，村干部把王承荣送到区政府扣押起来，用刑要王承荣供出“是谁叫你上告的”。并且两天不给他饭吃。以后，又把王承荣押送到县政府。县司法科仍以逼供方式，追逼王承荣的所谓“诬告”目的及其主谋人。王承荣在县政府被扣押期间，县政府竟将其与反革命罪犯监禁在一室，外出带上手铐。县政府、县委会对于西梁村反动的地主和富农向农民的反攻，却熟视无睹。这时，农民王连寿到山西日报控诉了西梁村反动的地主和富农向农民反攻的事情，并到省委纪律检查委员会，告发了上述事件。可是，王连寿返回后，也被扣押起来。盂县县委以及刘尚文见到山西日报的批评文字后，对群众批评仍继续压制，对西梁村地主反攻的事情继续放任不管。直到省委、地委纪律检查委员会指出这是一种敌我不分的表现以后，盂县县委会才主张把王连寿释放出来，并发动群众向反动的地主和富农进行斗争，同时表示要把王承荣释放出来。过了一个月，省委纪律检查委员会二次派人到盂县检查时，王承荣仍被扣押着。县委书记戎详德还说：“这是群众的要求。”（？）致使王承荣前后被扣押了三个月之久。
    盂县县委组织部长刘尚文（不止刘尚文一人，县委书记戎详德等均应包括在内——编者）压制批评的事件，已在群众中留下极其恶劣的印象。群众说：“王承荣是因为上告被扣的。”并有人错误地劝告王承荣说：“你可再不敢这样啦，省上不能常守着你，省上办事多会儿也离不了县、区。”
    通报继叙述了长治县公安局副局长、共产党员李维垣压制批评的错误行为。该局党员干部樊银安，因见该局有违反国家财政制度、报领空额等违法行为，即向中共长治地委纪律检查委员会控告揭发。长治地委纪律检查委员会经过实地检查，证明所控告的是事实，即决定予以处理。
    长治县公安局副局长李维垣接到中共长治地委纪律检查委员会令他进行检查的通知后，却说：“这粮是队员们吃啦，又不是我个人贪污了！”拒绝检查。经长治地委纪律检查委员会再三督促，李维垣一面以多报少，把十个月的空额改为三个月，企图减轻自己的错误；另一方面积极地搜集樊银安的缺点与错误事实，捕风捉影加以夸大，以达到报复的目的。同时又要求长治专署公安处调动樊银安的工作，并对上级威胁说：“如不处理樊银安的问题，他就和股长们集体辞职不干。”长治专署公安处对此不加分析，就停止了樊银安的工作，并调樊银安回公安处进行反省。后因李维垣调省行政干部学校学习，致使这一问题拖延了四个多月之久未作解决。后经长治地委纪律检查委员会发现，才作了最后处理。
    通报指出：王承荣、樊银安的控告，是符合党的利益的，完全是合法的正当的行为。但刘尚文、李维垣等，却以官僚主义、自由主义的态度对待这样严肃的问题，并对控告人采取了蛮横的打击报复手段，这是完全违反了党的民主原则和自我批评作风的，是一个原则性的错误。李维垣的错误，长治地委除在党内给予当众警告的处分外，并建议长治专署对长治县公安局吃空额粮问题，作认真处理。刘尚文和盂县县委会的错误，山西省委纪律检查委员会，已令他们进行严格的检讨，并拟给予适当的处分。
