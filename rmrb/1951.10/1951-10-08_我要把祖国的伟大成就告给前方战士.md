    I Want to Tell the Frontline Soldiers About the Great Achievements of the Motherland
    To the Editor:
    I returned to the country this time due to some business, and it happened to coincide with the floods in the Northeast. This flood was very large and washed away the railway lines. I was very worried that the traffic interruption would delay matters. Passengers estimated that it would take at least a month to repair the damaged railway. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the railway employees worked day and night to actively repair it, finally dispelling everyone's concerns. The train was running again after only ten days or so.
    Along the way, I saw that the train I was riding in was not only exceptionally clean, but also had complete facilities. What is especially praiseworthy are those train attendants. In their busy schedules, they took the time to perform allegro pieces in each carriage. The content mostly revolved around the current central tasks, such as "Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries" and "Resisting America, Aiding Korea." I personally witnessed and heard about the remarkable achievements of the motherland in economic construction, cultural construction, public security work, and support for the military and preferential treatment for their families. These achievements are constantly increasing every day. I deeply feel that these achievements have a great inspiring effect on the war against aggression and on our vast number of frontline soldiers. I will definitely report the enthusiastic situation of the motherland's construction and people's production to our soldiers.

    我要把祖国的伟大成就告给前方战士编辑同志：
    此次我因事返国，适逢东北发生水灾。这次水灾很大，把铁路线都冲坏了。我很担忧会因交通中断而耽误了事情。旅客都估计被冲坏的铁路，至少要一个月才能修好。但是，在共产党的领导下，铁路员工日夜不休地积极抢修，终于解除了大家的顾虑。火车在十几天之后就通车了。
    我一路上看到所乘的列车，不仅车内清洁异常，而且设备也很完善。尤其值得表扬的是那些列车员。他们在百忙中，抽出一些时间，在每个车间演唱快板，内容大多是配合当前的中心工作，如“镇压反革命”、“抗美援朝”等。我在各地亲眼见到、亲耳听到祖国在经济建设上、文化建设上、治安工作上、拥军优抚工作上的显著成绩，这些成绩每天在不断上升着。我深深地感到：这些成绩对于反侵略战争，对于我们前方广大战士的鼓舞作用是极大的。我一定将祖国建设和人民生产的热烈情况报告给我们的战士。
