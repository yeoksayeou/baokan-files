Dear Chairman Mao:

We are disabled veterans of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were wounded on the Korean battlefield and returned to China. On the battlefield, we encountered love and hate. After returning to China, we received the heartfelt condolences and love of the people of the motherland. Now we are happily studying in the school for honored disabled soldiers. In the old society, we were a group of oppressed people; today we are the masters of the country. Now, all classes have successively formulated patriotic pacts, and individuals have made study plans, actively learning under the leadership and assistance of teachers. Comrade Zhang Gaoyuan, whose right hand is disabled, practices writing with his left hand, and all kinds of assignments are ahead of his comrades. Comrade Teng Shifu is already forty-five years old, and the leadership approved him to take a rest in the sanatorium. He said, "I will learn as long as I live," and asked to stay in school to study. Now he can write more than four hundred characters! Other comrades have also made progress in the same way. Dear Chairman Mao! Without you, we would not have today!

Our bodies are disabled, but our minds are still healthy. We must bring out the spirit of killing enemies on the Korean battlefield in the past to learn culture, use the classroom as the battlefield, and use the pen as a weapon, quickly learn culture, practice skills, and prepare to serve the construction of the motherland. At the same time, we also practice thrift and carry out patriotic donation campaigns. In addition to saving one or two liang of rice per person per day, we also donate one-tenth to one-third of our subsidies to the motherland to purchase weapons, build national defense, support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, strive for the early victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and liberate Taiwan as soon as possible. All disabled veterans of a certain school for honored veterans

    我们一定要以战场杀敌的精神来学习文化亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是在朝鲜战场上负伤回国的人民志愿军残废军人。在战场上，我们接触的是爱和恨，回国后，受到了祖国人民衷心地慰问和热爱，现在在荣誉军人学校里愉快地学习。在旧社会，我们是一群被压迫者；今天我们作了国家的主人。现在各班都纷纷订立了爱国公约，个人都订了学习计划，在教员的领导和帮助下，积极地学习着。右手残废了的张高远同志，用左手练习写字，各种作业都走在同志们的前头。滕世福同志已经四十五岁了，上级批准他到教养院休养。他说：“我活到老就学到老”，要求留校学习。现在他已会写四百多字了！其他同志都同样地获得了进步。亲爱的毛主席！没有您，我们就没有今天呀！
    我们的身体都残废了，但是脑子依然健康。我们一定要拿出过去在朝鲜战场上杀敌的精神来学习文化，用课堂做战场，以笔杆当刀枪，赶快学好文化，练好本领，准备为祖国的建设事业服务。同时，我们又厉行节约，开展爱国捐献运动。每人每日除节约一两米外，还以津贴的十分之一到三分之一捐献给祖国，购买武器，建设祖国国防，支援人民志愿军，争取抗美援朝的早日胜利，早日解放台湾。荣誉军人某校全体志愿军残废军人
