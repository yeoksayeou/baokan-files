    On the occasion of celebrating the second National Day of the People’s Republic of China, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression calls on all Chinese and Asian people to pay close attention to the situation created by the United States' decision at the San Francisco Conference to rearm Japan and continue to occupy Japan.
    The so-called "Peace Treaty with Japan" forced upon the representatives of forty-seven other countries by the United States government in San Francisco on September 8, 1951, is in reality only a treaty of war.
    The Chinese people absolutely do not recognize the validity of this so-called "Peace Treaty with Japan." We fully support the position of the joint declaration of the Chinese democratic parties on September 2 and the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou of the Central People's Government on September 18 on this issue.
    We hope that all compatriots will forever remember this fact: the United States government never seriously assisted China during Japan's fourteen years of aggression against China, and after Japan's surrender, it did everything possible to foster the revival of Japanese aggressive forces. At the so-called "Peace Conference with Japan" convened in September 1951, China, which resisted Japanese aggression for the longest time, contributed the most, and sacrificed the most, was excluded. Moreover, the conference was manipulated to deprive China of its territories of Taiwan Island, the Penghu Islands, the Nansha Islands, and the Xisha Islands, to allow Japan to rearm, and to allow the United States to occupy Japan for a long time. For the sake of all the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan, for our own sake, and for the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must vow to oppose this illegal "Peace Treaty with Japan," vow to oppose the American imperialism that is hostile to and invades our country, and fight to the end for resisting America, aiding Korea, liberating Taiwan and other territories, consolidating the national defense of our great motherland, and preventing the danger of a new war in the Far East!
    We want to tell all Japanese patriots and peace-loving people: American imperialism is using the so-called "Peace Treaty with Japan" to push the Japanese nation further into the abyss of disaster. American imperialism is preparing to put Japan in a situation where it is surrounded by enemies on all sides, forcing the Japanese people to become slaves of American imperialism, shedding their own blood to exchange gold coins for American warmongers. The Chinese people are determined to unite with the Japanese people to the end to jointly oppose the American occupation of Japan and the rearmament of Japan. This unity is the most important guarantee for defending Japan's independence and freedom and for defending peace in the Far East.
    We want to tell the people of all oppressed nations in Asia: American imperialism is now the greatest enemy of the Asian people. The so-called "Peace Treaty with Japan" of the United States, which rearms Japan and continues to occupy Japan, is a declaration of war by imperialism against the Asian people. However, the Asian people, who account for more than half of mankind, can defeat all imperialist aggression and aggression plans as long as they unite. The Asian people have repeatedly demonstrated their firm will and great strength in the cause of striving for independence and peace. Now is the time for the people of Asian countries to take action in the face of the challenge of American imperialism.
    Let us raise the banner of unity even higher! Oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan! Oppose the United States' continued occupation of Japan! Long live the victory of the Asian people's struggle for independence and peace!

    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    为反对美国重新武装日本并继续占领日本宣言
    当庆祝中华人民共和国第二届国庆节的时候，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会要求全中国和全亚洲人民着重注意美国在旧金山会议上决定重新武装日本并继续占领日本所造成的形势。
    一九五一年九月八日美国政府强迫其他四十七国代表在旧金山签订的所谓“对日和约”，实际上只是一个战争的条约。
    中国人民绝对不承认这个所谓“对日和约”的效力。我们完全支持九月二日中国各民主党派的联合宣言和九月十八日中央人民政府周外长声明对于这个问题的立场。
    我们希望全国同胞永远记住这个事实：美国政府在日本侵略中国的十四年间从没有认真援助过中国，在日本投降以后百般扶植日本侵略势力复活，而在一九五一年九月召集的所谓“对日和会”上把反抗日本侵略时间最久贡献最多牺牲最大的中国排斥在外，并且操纵这个会议通过剥夺中国的领土台湾岛、澎湖列岛、南威岛、西沙群岛，允许日本重新武装，允许美国长期占领日本。为着在抗日战争中牺牲的一切军民先烈，为着我们自己，为着我们的子子孙孙，我们要誓死反对这个非法的“对日和约”，要誓死反对敌视和侵略我国的美帝国主义，为抗美援朝、解放台湾等领土、巩固伟大祖国的国防、制止远东新战争的危险而奋斗到底！
    我们要告诉日本的一切爱国者和爱和平的民众：美帝国主义正在经过所谓“对日和约”把日本民族进一步推入灾难的深渊。美帝国主义准备使日本陷于四面树敌的绝境，迫使日本人成为美帝国主义的奴隶，流自己的血来为美国战争贩子们换取金元。中国人民决心和日本人民团结到底，共同反对美国占领日本和重新武装日本。这个团结是保卫日本独立自由和保卫远东和平的最重要的保证。
    我们要告诉亚洲的一切被压迫民族的民众：美帝国主义现在是亚洲人民的最大的仇敌。美国的重新武装日本和继续占领日本的所谓“对日和约”，就是帝国主义对亚洲人民的宣战书。但是占人类半数以上的亚洲人民，只要团结一致，就能够打败帝国主义的一切侵略和侵略计划。亚洲人民已经再三表现出自己在争取独立和平的事业中的坚定意志和伟大力量。现在是亚洲各国人民在美帝国主义的挑战面前采取行动的时候了。
    让我们把团结的旗帜更高地举起来吧！反对美国重新武装日本！反对美国继续占领日本！亚洲人民争取独立和平的斗争胜利万岁！
        中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会  一九五一年十月一日
