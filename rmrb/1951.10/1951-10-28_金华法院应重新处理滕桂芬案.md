    The Jinhua Court Should Re-examine the Teng Guifen Case
    To the Editor:
    After reading the article "Bad Element Yu Zhangquan Took Advantage of the Situation to Force Woman Teng Guifen to Death" published on the third page of the People's Daily on October 9th, I am extremely disgusted with Yu Zhangquan and the related criminals. The egregious behavior of Yu Zhangquan, who consciously undermined the Marriage Law and abused public office for personal gain, cannot be tolerated. Today is a new society where the people are the masters, and we will never allow such bad people to continue to do evil. Therefore, I agree with the People's Daily editor's opinion: the Jinhua County People's Court should re-examine the excessively lenient sentences given to certain criminals involved in this case.

### 金华法院应重新处理滕桂芬案

专栏：读者来信

    金华法院应重新处理滕桂芬案编辑同志：
    看了十月九日人民日报第三版所载坏分子俞章全乘机逼死妇女滕桂芬一文后，我对俞章全及有关罪犯非常痛恨。像俞章全有意识地破坏婚姻法、假公报私的恶劣行为，是不能容许的。今天是人民做主的新社会，我们绝不允许这种坏人继续为非作歹。因此，我同意人民日报编者的意见：金华县人民法院对此案有关的某些罪犯的过轻判决，应重新加以处理。    王德仁
