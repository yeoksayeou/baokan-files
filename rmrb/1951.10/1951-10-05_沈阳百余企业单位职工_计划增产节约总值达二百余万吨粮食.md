Shenyang Over One Hundred Enterprises' Employees Plan to Increase Production and Practice Economy with a Total Value of Over Two Million Tons of Grain

    In Shenyang, over one hundred and thirty state-owned and municipal enterprise employees launched a competition in the increase production and practice economy campaign before National Day. The total value of the aforementioned units' production increase and economy plan has been increased to a value equivalent to over two million tons of grain. After the start of the competition, the factory employees came up with various methods of increasing production and practicing economy, further exploiting the potential industrial capacity. For example, the steelmaking plant of a certain machinery factory originally set the plan for the second half of the year to increase production to the value of 9,200 tons of grain. After the start of the competition, after all the employees actively came up with ideas, they improved the open hearth operation rate in the key to production and changed the plan to the value of 25,000 tons of grain. The fifth workshop of Machinery Factory No. 1 originally planned for the value of 180 tons of grain, and after the competition deepened, the plan was also changed to 830 tons. A certain kiln company under the Light Industry Bureau originally set the plan for the value of 800 tons of grain, but after further finding specific methods of increasing production, it was changed to increase production with the wealth of 1,000 tons of grain. When a certain rubber factory formulated the plan, it had no idea in mind. Later, it launched a rationalization proposal campaign among employees, and discovered huge potential capacity. On average, each worker can create a wealth of 100 tons of grain for the country by the end of the year.
    After each factory specifically determined the increase production and economy plan, it immediately launched a competition to complete the plan, and many factories created huge achievements in a very short time. Many workshops and groups, in order to welcome the arrival of National Day, strived to complete the September production tasks ahead of schedule in order to realize the increase production and economy plan. The forging workshop of the riveting and forging workshop of a certain machinery factory and the Chen Guojun group of the casting workshop of a certain factory have all completed the monthly production tasks ahead of schedule, the qualified rate of product quality has reached 100%, and they have saved a lot of wealth for the country. The employees of the mould making class of the sixth workshop of Machinery Factory No. 2 overcame the problems of three important products within a month, and also saved the country the wealth of 300 tons of grain. In addition, the Liu Shanming group of the first workshop of Machinery Factory No. 1, in order to welcome National Day, created a new record of increasing the production of rolled wire rods by 8 tons and 46 kilograms, which is unprecedented in the entire factory.

    沈阳百余企业单位职工
    计划增产节约总值达二百余万吨粮食
    沈阳市一百三十余国营和市营企业单位职工在国庆节前，在增产节约运动中展开竞赛。上述单位增产节约计划的总值已提高到等于二百余万吨粮食的价值。各工厂职工在竞赛开始后，想出各种增产节约的办法，进一步发挥工业潜在能力。如机器某厂炼钢场原订下半年增产计划为九千二百吨粮食的价值，竞赛开始后，经过全体职工积极想办法，提高了生产关键中的平炉作业率，而将计划改为二万五千吨粮食的价值。机器一厂的第五车间原计划为一百八十吨粮食的价值，竞赛深入后亦将计划改为八百三十吨。轻工业管理局所属的某窑业公司，原订计划为八百吨粮食的价值，但进一步找出了具体的增产办法后，即改为增产一千吨粮食的财富。橡胶某厂于制订计划时，心中无数，后来发动职工开展合理化建议运动，即发现了巨大的潜在能力，平均每个工人到年底为止，能多为国家创造一百吨粮食的财富。
    各工厂于具体确定了增产节约计划之后，立即发动了完成计划的竞赛，许多工厂在很短时间内创造了巨大的成绩。许多的车间和小组并为迎接国庆节的到来，纷纷争取提前完成九月份生产任务以便实现增产节约计划。机器某厂铆锻车间锻工场和某工厂铸工车间陈国俊小组等，都提前完成了全月生产任务，产品质量合格率达到百分之百，并为国家节约大量的财富。机器二厂第六车间取造班职工，一月内克服了三项重要产品的毛病，也多替国家节约了三百吨粮食的财富。此外，机器一厂的第一车间刘善明小组，为迎接国庆节，创造了提高压延盘条产量八吨四十六公斤的全厂空前新纪录。      （新华社）
