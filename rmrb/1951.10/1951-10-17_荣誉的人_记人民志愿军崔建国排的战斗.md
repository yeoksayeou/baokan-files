    Men of Honor – Remembering the Battle of the Cui Jianguo Platoon of the People's Volunteer Army
    Hu Liu

      I
    What is bravery? Cui Jianguo, a young combat hero of the People's Volunteer Army, answers: "Bravery is the concrete manifestation of patriotism and internationalism, the high sense of responsibility of revolutionary soldiers loyal to their duties, and the love of peace and a happy life." On May 18th, in the battle to annihilate the 38th Regiment of the 2nd US Division at Garisan and Daeshui-dong, Cui Jianguo and all the soldiers of his platoon fully demonstrated these noble sentiments.

    Before the battle began, the Cui Jianguo platoon received the "spearhead" mission. The spearhead mission is very glorious, but also very arduous. There is a saying in the People's Volunteer Army: "Honor is not a cheap thing," and that is exactly what it means. One day, the Party Secretary of the battalion went to talk to Cui Jianguo, and he said: "Comrade Cui Jianguo, you are a Communist Party member, and you are leading a platoon of men. Your responsibility is not just for yourself, but for every soldier in your platoon; that is to say, a commander should know how to cherish soldiers and eliminate the enemy!" Cui Jianguo firmly remembered the words of the battalion Party Secretary. These words became his strength in battle.

    In war, there is something most precious, and that is "time." Brave and proactive people always stand at the forefront of time. Cui Jianguo is this kind of person. He led the soldiers in training and studied tactics under extremely difficult conditions. They seized every minute, every second of time. Their training ground was the battlefield; they trained while fighting, dispersing for training during the day under enemy bombing, and concentrating for training at night. They demonstrated the diligent and courageous character of the Chinese people. They were not only a hundred times braver in war, but also a first-class army with excellent skills and tactics. Due to excessive day and night work, Cui Jianguo once coughed up blood. Squad Leader Wang Laicheng advised him to rest, but Cui Jianguo said: "Comrade Wang Laicheng, are you trying to cause me pain? Do you understand?"

    "Platoon leader, you care too much about us, but you don't care about yourself..."

    "I care about you? What are you doing? Isn't it because you are risking your lives to care about others?"

    "Platoon leader, you should take a rest!" Wang Laicheng tried to persuade him.

     "Should? There is only one should today: that is to eliminate the enemy!"

    One night, to check the degree of technical proficiency, the Cui Jianguo platoon conducted live ammunition exercises. Bunkers were built on the ground with a lamp placed inside; it was stipulated that the machine gun should fire from 100 meters away, the "light machine gunners" should fire while moving, and grenades should be thrown from 50 meters away.

    The exercise began. The first was machine gunner Wei Ming, who, according to the designated position, extinguished the lamp in the bunker with just one bullet, receiving cheers from all his comrades. The second was machine gunner Tao Quan. He only shot through the paper of the bunker's firing port and blushed, asking to try a second time. Cui Jianguo stopped him and said: "We must save bullets. If you hit the firing port, you can basically hit the enemy; isn't a person a bigger target than a lamp!" Everyone laughed. Tao Quan brushed the dirt off his body and pouted, saying: "I practice with Wei Ming all day long, but..." The soldier blushed. The sense of honor made him feel ashamed. Our soldiers, inspired by a high degree of revolutionary heroism, are always stubborn people.

    Next, Squad Leader Wang Laicheng demonstrated the "light machine gun," firing while moving within 100 meters, with all the bullets accurately hitting the bunker's firing port. The soldiers cheered, and twelve "light machine gunners" surrounded Wang Laicheng, one saying: "Squad leader, teach me!" Another saying: "Teach me first!" Seeing this situation, Cui Jianguo secretly praised these soldiers in his heart: "With such good soldiers, what is there to fear!"

    After this exercise, Tao Quan, the machine gunner who failed to extinguish the lamp, worked even harder to practice his skills. Cui Jianguo was moved and said: "Comrade Tao Quan, I know you will work hard." Tao Quan replied with a smile: "Platoon leader, watch our second live ammunition firing in battle!"

    Cui Jianguo was usually very affectionate to the soldiers, but during training and combat, his requirements for each soldier in terms of tactics and techniques were very strict. He understood that strictly demanding them was precisely to cherish their lives and guarantee victory in battle.

II
    On May 16th, the troops were to break through the defense lines of the US 36th and 37th Regiments at night and insert themselves into Garisan!

    After walking fifteen li, flames were discovered at the foot of the mountain ahead. Cui Jianguo thought: The most important thing now is to capture prisoners to understand the situation. So he led the Sixth Squad to walk in the front.

    The moon rose. Flames flickered in the east and west, and red signals streaked through the air as the fraternal units on the left and right wings began their fierce attacks.

    The troops climbed over the mountain, and there was a river in front. When the Sixth Squad passed the bridgehead, they were discovered by the enemy. In an instant, a web of fire was woven over the bridgehead. As a soldier was about to rush past, Cui Jianguo grabbed his shoulder.

     "Who are you?"

    "Tao Quan!"

    "Crouch in that pit, draw the enemy's fire with cold shots, then go over... All squads follow me!"

    They walked in the water, forcefully but silently wading across the river. At this time, the enemy poured steel from all directions toward the bridgehead, and dozens of flares hung in the air. Cui Jianguo looked at it and secretly found it amusing.

    When passing through the pine forest, a minefield was discovered. Mines were buried underground and hung on trees, everywhere were mines. Cui Jianguo stepped on something and heard a strange sound. He felt a chill and immediately thought of the effectiveness of the mine. He stepped on it without letting go, bent down, unscrewed the screw, removed the spring, and rendered the mine ineffective. The whole platoon carried out mine clearing work.

    The main force followed the path of the spearhead platoon and quickly occupied Height 752, which was Garisan.

    During the day, another enemy defense line was encountered on the way forward. The battalion commander ordered: Take down the four bunkers in front and insert ourselves! Cui Jianguo led the Sixth Squad to sneak up to sixty meters from the bunkers when the enemy's fire blocked them; the platoon suffered casualties while crossing the open ground. The battalion commander ordered them to stay put and await orders to attack. The soldiers endured hunger and thirst in the newly dug fortifications.

    The enemy's superior firepower blocked the road to Daeshui-dong.

III
    Cui Jianguo observed the surrounding terrain with binoculars and found that there was about a company of enemies in front of him. After careful consideration, he ordered Tao Quan to crawl back and report the situation to the battalion commander.

    Tao Quan brought back the battalion commander's instructions and reported good news, saying that the company commander had returned from the hospital.

    "The company commander is back?!" Cui Jianguo asked almost strangely, because the company commander had been ill for twenty days, how could he be back at this time? The soldiers listened excitedly.

    "The company commander is back!" Tao Quan said with a smile, "He is sitting in the battalion headquarters, he was criticized..."

    "Criticized?" "Yes, because his body has not fully recovered, the battalion commander and political instructor criticized him together, but the company commander always said: Give me a task, leaders, I can't leave my troops..."

    The soldiers all grinned, missing the company commander.

    Cui Jianguo met the company commander at the battalion headquarters, and the two shook hands tightly. They had not seen each other for twenty days.

    "How are the comrades?"

    "They are all well, they all miss you, company commander."

    "Comrade Cui Jianguo, order your Second Platoon to take down the four bunkers. Our main force must pass through here. Our destination is not here, but Daeshui-dong." The company commander leaned close to Cui Jianguo and said: "The battalion commander won't let me go up, and ordered you to act as my deputy; I believe in you, Comrade Cui Jianguo."

    "Company commander, how many people should we use to take down these four bunkers?"

    "Your whole platoon."

    "In my opinion, at most one squad."

    "One squad?... Okay, tell me about your plan." The company commander's eyes immediately brightened, and he listened to Cui Jianguo's report with a smile. In the end, he was satisfied with the plan and instructed Cui Jianguo: "But be careful, if there is a second time, it will be troublesome."

IV
    Cui Jianguo happily crawled back to the Sixth Squad's position, immediately carried out mobilization and division of labor, dividing the entire squad into four assault teams, each team attacking one bunker. He ordered Wang Laicheng to attack the first, Mou Jinchun to attack the third, Ping Qishan to attack the fourth, and himself and Tao Quan to attack the second.

    At dusk, the 60mm mortars began to bombard, and each team dispersed and moved forward. The soldiers crawled along the ditches, their whole bodies immersed in the water, with only their heads and muzzles exposed. What a difficult one hundred and fifty meters! They bypassed the barbed wire and were only fifty meters away from the bunkers. A soldier at the front stepped on a mine and sacrificed his life. The heroes stood up, hung the "light machine guns" around their necks, and fired at the bunkers together. Another soldier fell.

    Cui Jianguo blew the bugle. The bugle sound vibrated in the soldiers' eardrums. This sound was a call of honor, a call from the people of the motherland. The heroes rushed into the bunkers. The platoon attacked from the front, and the enemies in the trenches fled. Eighteen American corpses lay in the four bunkers, and the ground was covered with blood. Tao Quan crawled out of the bunker and said to Cui Jianguo:

    "Platoon leader, did you see my second live ammunition firing?" He pointed to the bunker and said: "Eight, none of them survived."

    "Comrade Tao Quan, I saw it. You shot into the bunker with your first burst of fire, and then you threw in a grenade, right?"

    "Yes! Platoon leader, you are absolutely right."

    The four bunkers were smoking. This was the result of five minutes of fighting.

V
    It was getting dark, and there was not a minute to spare. The iron stream of our army rushed straight to Daeshui-dong from the gap, where the 38th Regiment of the US Army was located.

    Late at night, approaching Daeshui-dong, the Cui Jianguo platoon received the task of occupying three hilltops. How many enemies were on these three hilltops? What was the situation in Daeshui-dong Village? No one knew. Cui Jianguo groped towards the edge of the village, his body crawling on the ground, crawling... His hand touched someone's hair, and he was so surprised that he almost shouted out. It turned out to be the corpse of a Korean woman, stark naked, with several black holes in her belly, and the blood had dried up. Cui Jianguo's nose stung and a few tears fell. He remembered his two elder sisters who were killed by the Japanese devils. By the dim moonlight, Cui Jianguo also saw corpses hanging on trees. He continued to crawl forward, crawling into a small thatched cottage. There was a Korean woman there, who cried out in alarm and ran into the cellar. Cui Jianguo explained in Korean that he was from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. When she saw clearly, she threw herself on Cui Jianguo, weeping and pointing to her relatives who had been killed by the American devils. At this time, an old man came out of the cellar. This was the woman's father-in-law, and he grabbed Cui Jianguo's hand and said, "Long live Mao Zedong!" He gestured to Cui Jianguo that the enemy's regimental headquarters was located in Daeshui-dong. Just as they were talking, an American devil suddenly came. Cui Jianguo waved his hand and told them to hide. He flashed to the wall and grabbed the guy, dragging him all the way back and handing this "tongue" over to the battalion headquarters.

    Based on the situation, the battalion commander ordered the Cui Jianguo platoon to immediately occupy the three hilltops. After the assault began, Cui Jianguo outflanked from the rear. An enemy machine gunner was firing. He thought: "Go back to America!" He smashed the guy's head, seized the machine gun, and swept the enemy's position. The soldiers took the opportunity to throw grenades into the enemy ranks. The first hilltop was occupied, and then the Sixth Squad occupied the second hilltop. The enemies on the third hilltop fled without a fight. In just ten minutes, the three hilltops were occupied, opening up the assault route. At this time, the company commander came to the Second Platoon's position. He had come on orders. Because the battalion commander had no choice but to agree to this stubborn person. He was constantly thinking about the Ninth Company, the Second Platoon, and Cui Jianguo at the battalion headquarters. Now he was here, standing among his beloved soldiers again. He said excitedly:

    "Comrades! The battalion commander asked me to tell you that the Second Platoon will be commended! You, Comrade Cui Jianguo, will be commended! You, Comrade Wang Laicheng, will be commended!... Comrades, because of you, the Ninth Company has received honor, you are the creators of honor!"

VI
    The battalion headquarters' messenger ran to convey the order: the Second Platoon continues to advance, break into Daeshui-dong, and disrupt the enemy's headquarters. Cui Jianguo said to the company commander: "Company commander, go back to the battalion headquarters, I'm here." The company commander said: "Are you saying I'm afraid of death?!" Everyone was silent in the darkness, and Cui Jianguo seemed to see the company commander's face turning angry.

    The troops of the First Battalion came over, and the soldiers greeted each other. The First Battalion's Chief of Staff hugged Cui Jianguo and said: "Comrade Cui Jianguo, well done! I heard the news of your meritorious service. Please give my regards to your heroes! I use the most precious honor of a soldier to call you, you are the most honorable people!"

    After the company commander and Cui Jianguo discussed it properly, they started to move forward again. They advanced along the highway, with the enemies on both sides of the highway. The troops advanced in a grand manner, and the cowardly enemies could not have imagined that there would be such fearless troops.

    Bypassing the side and rear of Daeshui-dong, they encountered the enemy's artillery position. The American artillerymen were blindly bombarding. Okay, let's see our firepower! Countless red swords of fire annihilated all the enemies on the position. The artillery became mute, and a fierce assault battle was unfolding around Daeshui-dong. The company commander looked at his watch and said: "Cui Jianguo, now, we are going to perform the final act for the 38th Regiment of the US Army, let's go, let's take a look at the terrain ahead."

    "Let me and the Sixth Squad Leader go."

    "I don't like this attitude of yours, let's go!"

VII
    The company commander and Cui Jianguo crawled towards the front of Daeshui-dong. The company commander had a strange temper, he was always particularly excited when carrying out difficult tasks. Now he was crawling, and he felt that he had a lot to say. He gently called Cui Jianguo:

    "Comrade Cui Jianguo!"

    "Yes!"

    "What are you thinking about?"

    "I think we fought very happily today. The victory in Daeshui-dong will definitely be spread quickly, to the motherland, all over the world; maybe even our names will be mentioned!"

    "You are right, we are brave people, and we are also happy people. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is not a simple noun, but glory. People all over the world place their hopes on us. The motherland, our parents, wives, children, are all watching us, so we always feel this happiness... I left you for twenty days, it was like falling out of happiness!"

    They crawled forward for a while, and just as they were about to go downhill, the enemies launched a counterattack in a dark mass. To be precise, this was not a counterattack, but the enemies were trying to escape, because this was their escape route. Cui Jianguo hurriedly pushed the company commander back, and he and the signalman held off the enemies.

    The enemies bombarded this position with all kinds of artillery fire, the earth columns rose into the sky in the fields, and flames rose everywhere. The company commander was hit by an incendiary bomb. Wang Laicheng and the soldiers went up to rescue him, only to see the company commander covered in flames and his waist broken by the explosion. They put out the flames with soil and carried the company commander's body down.

    Cui Jianguo shouted: "Avenge the company commander!"

    The soldiers roared: "Avenge the company commander!"

    Wei Ming shouted while shooting: "Come on, you guys!" The enemies were swept down by him. Wang Laicheng was seriously injured in his right shoulder and leg, but he continued to shoot with his left hand, crawling with his other leg. The entire platoon concentrated its firepower on the enemies, engaging in close combat, and fully exploiting the power of light weapons. The enemies fell one after another. All the bullets were used up, and the enemies launched a counterattack again.

    Cui Jianguo waved his bayonet, and he issued a call that shook the earth:

     "For the motherland, for Chairman Mao!"

    The heroes shouted and rushed into the enemy ranks. For a time, shouts of killing rose everywhere. In the dark night, a heroic and fierce bayonet fight unfolded on the enemy's position. Wei Ming ran out of bullets, and an enemy rushed up and was killed by him with a stone. Two more enemies stabbed at him with bayonets, but he whirled his shovel and smashed the heads of the two enemies. Ammunition handler Wang Yincheng was pressed under an enemy, but he bit off the enemy's ear, and that guy ran away holding his bloody head. Squad leader Shen Xueli, although wounded in several places, still fought bravely with the enemy.

    What about Cui Jianguo? He was seeing red, stabbing six enemies to death in a row, bending the bayonet. His shoulder and legs were also injured.

    This earth-shattering melee terrified the enemies. The surviving enemies fled back to Daeshui-dong in panic. Cui Jianguo and his heroes were divided into two arrowheads, directly into the enemy regimental headquarters, rushing into the car park and engaging in another bayonet fight. Cui Jianguo rolled on the spot, and there were enemy guns and ammunition everywhere. He gathered a pile of carbines and hid behind a car. At this time, thirty enemies rushed from the front. Cui Jianguo fired with both hands, heating up the two guns, then switching to the other two. He shot down more than twenty enemies, and the remaining eight enemies shouted and knelt in front of Cui Jianguo, raising both hands high. One of them was a major.

  Our army's main force rushed in from all around, and annihilation battles unfolded everywhere.

VIII
    The 38th Regiment of the US Army was annihilated. The streets, houses, and suburbs of Daeshui-dong were filled with enemy corpses, and cars, weapons, and materials were everywhere. The soldiers were cleaning up the battlefield, and batches of prisoners were being escorted past. Young men Tao Quan and Wei Ming walked proudly, whistling, and saluted the platoon leader from afar. Cui Jianguo smiled, and Tao Quan and Wei Ming also smiled. They did not speak, they were full of happiness.

    Cui Jianguo tightened his collar and tidied his clothes and hat, then strode briskly to see the regimental commander. The regimental commander was a handsome young soldier, with the aura of a hero and a strong physique. Cui Jianguo saluted the regimental commander and gave a report. The regimental commander shook his hand and said:

    "Comrade Cui Jianguo, I thank you on behalf of the division leaders, thank you and your soldiers, you have gloriously completed your mission. Now, I want to formally announce the orders from above: you are now the company commander of the Ninth Company. But don't rush, what is more important is: to commend you and your comrades, and to honorably call the Second Platoon you lead the 'Chinese Sons and Daughters Cui Jianguo Platoon'." Then the regimental commander announced the list of commendations. Those who received special merit were: Cui Jianguo, Wang Laicheng, Tao Quan, and Shen Xueli. Those who received first-class merit were: Wei Ming and Hu Hailu. It was also announced that the Ninth Company and the Second Platoon each received a major merit, and the Sixth Squad received a special merit.

    Applause rang out all around, and Cui Jianguo's eyes were filled with tears. He remembered the words of the company commander, so his young body, as strong as a steel bar, stood straight. He said in a low but very clear voice: "Regimental commander, this is the greatest happiness."

    Yes, this is happiness, this is the incomparable joy felt by brave and simple people. On the beautiful Dongali Mountain in Korea, the Korean people erected a large monument for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which read:

    "Here, we want to tell our Korean people's descendants for generations to come, to always remember that your happy life today was created by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting with their internationalist spirit, risking blood and heads!"

    This is not only the voice of the Korean people, but also the voice of the people of the motherland, and the voice of the people of the world. Is there anything happier than being loved by the people? No! Because this is the greatest glory and the greatest joy of mankind. Who are the people who get this happiness? They are the glorious soldiers loved by people all over the world, the most beloved people in the eyes of the people of the motherland.

    荣誉的人——记人民志愿军崔建国排的战斗
    胡流
      一
    勇敢是什么？人民志愿军的青年战斗英雄崔建国回答说：“勇敢就是爱国主义与国际主义的精神、革命军人忠于职责的高度责任感和热爱和平与幸福生活的具体表现。”五月十八日，在加里山、大水洞痛歼美军第二师第三十八团的战斗中，崔建国和他全排的战士们，充分地表现了这种高贵的感情。
    战斗开始前，崔建国排接受了“尖刀”任务。尖刀任务是十分光荣的，但也是非常艰巨的。人民志愿军有一句格言：“荣誉不是廉价的东西”，正是这个意思。有一天，营党委书记去找崔建国谈话，他说：“崔建国同志，你是一个共产党员，你带领的是一排人，你的责任不只是在于你一个人，而且在于你全排的每一个战士；就是说，一个指挥员应该懂得怎样爱护战士，消灭敌人！”崔建国牢牢地记住了营党委书记的话。这些话变成了他的战斗的力量。
    在战争中有一种最珍贵的东西，这便是“时间”。勇敢积极的人，总是站在时间的最前头。崔建国就是这种人。他在异常困难的条件下领导着战士练兵，研究战术。他们抓紧了每一分钟、每一秒钟的时间。他们的操场就是阵地，他们一面战斗，一面练兵；白天在敌机轰炸下分散练，黑夜集中练。他们表现出了中国人民勤劳勇敢的性格。他们不仅在战争中勇气百倍，而且是技术和战术优良的第一流军队。由于日夜操劳过度，崔建国曾经吐血。六班长王来成劝他休息，崔建国却说： “王来成同志，你这是叫我痛苦，你明白吗？”
    “排长，你太爱护我们，而你却不顾惜自己……。”
    “我爱你们？你们正在做什么呢？不正是因为你们正拚着命爱别人吗？”
    “排长，你应该休息休息啦！”王来成想说服他。
     “应该？今天只有一个应该：就是消灭敌人！”
    有一天黑夜，为了检查技术熟练的程度，崔建国排进行实弹演习。地上修起了地堡，里边放一盏灯；规定机枪在一百公尺外射击，“小转盘”边走边射击，手榴弹则在五十公尺外投掷。
    演习开始了。第一个是机枪手魏明，他按照指定位置，只一发子弹便打熄了地堡里的灯，受到全体战友的喝采。第二个是机枪手陶泉。他只射穿了地堡枪眼的纸，红着脸要求试第二次。崔建国制止他说：“要节省子弹，你打进枪眼基本上就可以打住敌人；人不是比灯的目标还大吗！”大家笑了。陶泉拂掉身上的土噘着嘴说：“我同魏明一天到晚在一块练，可是……。”这个战士红了脸。战士的荣誉感使他感到羞耻。我们的战士在高度的革命英雄主义精神鼓舞下，永远是倔强的人。
    接着是六班长王来成演习“小转盘”，他在一百公尺以内，边走边射击，子弹都准确地射进地堡枪眼里去。战士们欢呼着，十二个“小转盘手”把王来成围起来，这个说：“六班长教我！”那个说：“先教我！”崔建国看到这种情形，心里暗自夸奖着这些战士：“有这样好的战士还怕什么！”
    这次演习后，那个没把灯打熄的机枪手陶泉，更加努力练习技术。崔建国见了感动地说：“陶泉同志，我知道你会努力的。”陶泉笑着回答：“排长，你在战斗中看我们第二次实弹射击吧！”
    崔建国平日对战士非常亲热，可是在练兵和作战时，对每一个战士在战术和技术上的要求，却非常严格。他懂得，严格地要求他们，正是爱惜他们的生命和保证战斗的胜利。二
    五月十六日，部队就要在夜里突破美军第三十六、三十七团的防线，插到加里山去！
    走了十五里路，正面山根发现火光，崔建国想：现在最要紧的是捉俘虏了解情况。他便带了六班走在前头。
    月亮升上来了。东边和西边闪耀着火光，空中曳着红色的信号，左右翼的兄弟部队开始了猛烈的攻击。
    部队爬过大山，前边有一条河流。当六班通过桥头时，被敌人发觉了，霎时间，桥头上交织成一片火网，有一个战士正要冲过去，崔建国抓住了他的肩膀。
     “你是谁？”
    “陶泉！”
    “蹲到那个坑里，打冷枪吸引敌人火力，然后过去……，各班跟我来！”
    他们走在水里，两条腿用力地但是不出声音地淌过了河。这时，敌人从四面八方向桥头倾泻着钢铁，空中挂着几十个照明弹。崔建国看着那里暗自觉得好笑。
    通过松林的时候，发现了地雷阵地，地下埋着，树上挂着，到处是地雷。崔建国踏着一件东西，听到一种异样的声响，他打了一个冷战，马上想到地雷的效能，便踏住不放，弯下腰把螺丝拧下来，去掉弹簧，使地雷失去了爆炸的效力。全排进行了扫除地雷的工作。
    主力部队沿着尖刀排的道路过来，迅速攻占了七五二高地，这便是加里山。
    白天，在前进途中又遇到敌人的一道防线。营长命令：打掉当前四个地堡，插进去！崔建国带六班摸到离地堡六十公尺时，敌人火力封锁住他们；一排通过开阔地时，有了伤亡。营长命令原地不动，待命攻击。战士们在新挖好的工事里忍受着饥渴。
    敌人的优势火力，阻住了去大水洞的道路。三
    崔建国用望远镜观察了周围地形，发现当前敌人约一连兵力，他经过深思熟虑后命令陶泉爬回去把情况报告给营长。
    陶泉带回营长的指示，并报告了一个好消息，说连长从医院里回来了。
    “连长回来啦！？”崔建国几乎是奇怪地问，因为连长已经病了二十天，怎么他在这时候回来了呢？战士们都兴奋地听着。
    “连长回来啦！”陶泉笑着说：“他坐在营指挥所里，他受到批评……。”
    “受到批评？” “嗯，因为他的身体并没完全复原，营长和教导员一齐批评他，可是连长老是说：首长给我任务吧，我离不开我的部队呀……。”
    战士们都裂开嘴唇笑了，他们想念着连长。
    崔建国在营指挥所见到了连长，两个人紧紧地握手。他们已经二十天不见了。
    “同志们都好？”
    “都好，他们都想念你，连长。”
    “崔建国同志，命令你们二排把四个地堡拿下来，我们的主力要从这里通过去，我们的目的地不是这里，而是大水洞。”连长靠近崔建国说：“营长不让我上去，命令你代理我的职务；我相信你，崔建国同志。”
    “连长，这四个地堡用多少人打呢？” “你们一个排。” “我的意见最多是一个班。”
    “一个班？……好吧，把你的计划谈谈吧。”连长的眼睛立刻明亮起来，微笑地倾听着崔建国的报告。最后他满意这个计划，并嘱咐崔建国说：“但是要小心，如果再来第二次就麻烦啦。”四
    崔建国愉快地爬回六班阵地，马上进行动员和分工，把全班分成四个突击小组，每个突击组打一个地堡，他命令王来成打第一个，牟金纯打第三个，平其山打第四个，自己和陶泉打第二个。
    黄昏时候，六○炮开始轰击，各组散开往前运动。战士们顺着水沟爬，全身浸在水里，只有头和枪口露在外边。多么艰难的一百五十公尺呀！他们绕过铁丝网，离地堡只有五十公尺了，走在最前边的一个战士，踏响地雷牺牲了。英雄们站起来，把“小转盘”挂在脖子上，一齐向地堡开火。又一个战士倒了下去。
    崔建国吹起小马号。号声在战士的耳鼓里震荡，这声音是荣誉的号召，是祖国人民的号召。英雄们冲进了地堡。一排从正面攻击上来，战壕里的敌人逃跑了。四个地堡里躺着十八个美国人的尸体，地上流着血水。陶泉从地堡里爬出来向崔建国说：
    “排长，你看见我的第二次实弹射击了吗？”他指着地堡说：“八个，一个也没活着。”
    “陶泉同志，我看见啦，你第一梭子就射进地堡，后来你又投进手榴弹，对不对？” “对！排长，你说的完全对。”
    四个地堡在冒烟。这是五分钟的战绩。五
    天黑了，一分钟也不能停留。我军的铁流从缺口直奔大水洞，那里是美军第三十八团的所在地。
    深夜，接近了大水洞，崔建国排接受了攻占三个山头的任务。这三个山头有多少敌人呢？大水洞村里是什么情况呢？不知道。崔建国向村边摸去，他的身子在土地上爬着，爬着……他的手摸到一个人的头发，他惊讶得几乎喊出声音来，原来是一个朝鲜女人的尸体，全身一丝不挂，肚皮上有几个黑窟窿，血已经干枯了。崔建国鼻子一酸就掉下了几滴泪珠，他想起被日本鬼子杀死的两个姐姐。借着朦胧的月光，崔建国又看见树上挂着的尸体。他继续爬过去，爬进了一间小草房。那里有一个朝鲜女人，她惊叫了一声便向地洞里跑。崔建国用朝鲜话说明他是中国人民志愿军。当她看清楚的时候，便扑在崔建国的身上，流着泪手指着被美国鬼子杀死的亲人。这时从地洞里出来一个老人，这是那个女人的公公，他抓着崔建国的手说：“毛泽东万岁！”他用手势告诉崔建国说，大水洞住着敌人的团指挥部。正在说话间，忽然来了一个美国鬼子。崔建国挥手叫她们躲开，他闪在墙根，伸手一把抓住那家伙，一路上拖着回来，把这个“舌头”交到营指挥所去了。
    营长根据情况，命令崔建国排马上占领三个山头。冲锋开始后，崔建国从后边迂回过去，敌人的一个机枪手正在射击，他心里想：“回你的美国去吧！”就把那家伙的脑袋瓜敲碎了，夺过机枪便对着敌人的阵地扫射起来，战士们趁机把手榴弹投进敌群。第一个山头被占领了，接着六班又攻占了第二个山头，第三个山头的敌人不战而逃。只十分的时间就占领三个山头，打开了突击道路。就在这时候，连长来到二排阵地上，他是得到命令来的。因为对这样倔强的人，营长只好答应了他。他在营指挥所时刻想着九连，想着二排，想着崔建国。现在他来了，他又站在他的心爱的战士们中间。他兴奋地说：
    “同志们！营长让我来告诉你们，给你们二排立功！给你，崔建国同志，立功！给你，王来成同志，立功！……同志们，因为你们，九连得到了荣誉，你们是荣誉的创造人！”
    六
    营部通讯员跑来传达命令：二排继续前进，打进大水洞，打乱敌人的指挥部。崔建国向连长说：“连长，你回营指挥所去吧，这里有我。”连长说：“你是说我怕死？！”黑暗中大家都沉默着，崔建国好像在看见连长那张脸正在发怒。
    一营的部队过来了，战士们互相问候着健康，一营参谋长抱着崔建国说： “崔建国同志，打得很好！我听到你们立功的消息了。请替我问候你的英雄们！我用军人最宝贵的荣誉称呼你们，你们是最荣誉的人！”
    连长和崔建国商议妥当，便又开始前进了。他们沿着公路前进，公路的两边是敌人。部队大模大样地前进，胆怯的敌人是不可能料到会有这样的无畏的部队的。
    绕过大水洞侧后，遇到敌人的炮兵阵地。那些美军炮手们正在盲目地轰击。好吧，看看我们的火力吧！无数条红色的火剑，把敌人全部消灭在阵地上。炮变成了哑叭，大水洞的周围正展开激烈的冲杀战。连长看看表说： “崔建国，现在，就要向美军第三十八团表演最后一出戏，走吧，到前边看看地形。” “我和六班长去吧。”
    “我不喜欢你这种态度，走！”七
    连长和崔建国向大水洞的前沿爬去。连长有一种怪脾气，每当执行艰苦的任务时，他总是特别兴奋。现在他正爬着，他觉得有许多话想说出来，他轻轻地唤着崔建国：
    “崔建国同志！”
    “有！”
    “你在想什么？” “我觉得今天打得很痛快，大水洞的胜利一定会马上传出去，传到祖国，传遍全世界；说不定还有我们的名字哩！” “你说得很对，我们是勇敢的人，也是幸福的人。中国人民志愿军不是一个简单的名词，而是光荣。全世界人民把希望寄托在我们身上。祖国，我们的父母妻子儿女，都在看着我们，所以我们时刻感觉到这种幸福。……我离开你们二十天，就好像从幸福里掉出来！”
    他们向前爬了一段路，正要下坡的时候，黑压压的敌人反扑上来。正确些说这不是反扑，而是敌人要逃跑，因为这里是他们的后路。崔建国慌忙把连长推回去，他和通讯员顶住敌人。
    敌人用各种炮火向这片阵地轰击，田野上土柱冲天，火焰四起。连长被一颗燃烧弹击中，王来成和战士们上去抢救，只见连长浑身是火，腰被炸断了。他们用土扑灭火焰，把连长的尸体背下去。
    崔建国高喊一声：“为连长报仇！”
    战士们怒吼着：“为连长报仇！”
    魏明一面射击一面喊：“上来吧，小子们！”敌人被他扫倒一片。王来成右肩和腿部负重伤，他用左手继续射击，用另一只腿爬着。全排人集中火力向敌人射击，短兵相接，充分发挥了轻火器的威力，敌人一片一片地倒下去。子弹全部打光了，敌人又反扑上来。
    崔建国挥动着刺刀，他发出了震动大地的号召：
     “为祖国，为毛主席！”
    英雄们呼喊着纷纷冲入敌群，一时杀声四起，在漆黑的夜里，在敌人阵地上展开了英勇而激烈的白刃战。魏明子弹打光了，一个敌人冲上来，被他用石头打死；又有两个敌人用刺刀刺来，他飞舞着铁锹，劈碎了那两个敌人的脑袋瓜。弹药手王银成被一个敌人压在底下，他咬掉了敌人的耳朵，那家伙抱着血淋淋的脑袋逃跑了。班长申学礼虽然负伤四处，还勇猛地和敌人拚杀。
    崔建国呢？他杀红了眼睛，一连刺死六个敌人，把刺刀使弯了，他的肩上和腿上也负了伤。
    这一场惊天动地的肉搏战，杀得敌人胆战心惊，活着的敌人慌乱地逃回大水洞。崔建国和他的英雄们分成两个箭头，直插敌团指挥部，冲到汽车群里又进行了白刃战。崔建国就地打着滚，遍地是敌人丢弃的枪支和弹药，他收拾了一堆卡宾枪，隐蔽在一辆汽车后边。这时从正面冲来三十个敌人，崔建国用双手开枪，打热了这两支，再换那两支。敌人被他打倒二十多个，剩下的八个敌人喊叫着跪在崔建国面前，高高地举着两只手，当中有一个是少校。
  我军主力部队从四周冲进来，各处展开了歼灭战。八
    美军第三十八团被歼灭了。大水洞的街上、房子里、郊外，处处是敌人的尸体，遍地是汽车、武器与物资。战士们正在打扫战场，一批一批的俘虏被押着走过去。青年小伙子陶泉和魏明洋洋得意地走着，嘴里吹着口哨，老远就向排长立正敬礼。崔建国笑了，陶泉和魏明也笑了，他们没有说话，他们充满了快乐。
    崔建国紧了紧风纪扣，整理了一下衣帽，便迈着轻快的步子去见团长。团长是一个英俊的青年军人，一副英雄的气概，结实的身材。崔建国向团长敬礼后作了报告。团长握着他的手说：
    “崔建国同志，我代表师首长谢谢你，谢谢你的战士们，你们光荣地完成了任务。现在，我要向你正式宣布上级的命令：你从现在起，已经是九连的连长了。但是你不要忙，更重要的是：给你和你的战友们立功，荣誉地称呼你所领导的二排为‘中华儿女崔建国排’”。接着团长宣布了立功名单，立特等功的是：崔建国、王来成、陶泉、申学礼，立一等功的是：魏明、胡海陆，并宣布九连和二排各立大功一次，六班立特功一次。
    四周响起了掌声，崔建国眼眶里充满了热泪。他想起连长说的话，于是他那年轻的、茁壮得像钢条似的身子笔直地站着。他低声地但是十分清楚地说： “团长，这是最大的幸福。”
    是的，这是幸福，这是勇敢朴实的人所感受到的无比的快乐。在朝鲜美丽的东阿里山上，朝鲜人民给中国人民志愿军立下一块大字纪念碑，上边写道：
    “在这里，要告诉我们朝鲜人民后辈世世代代的子孙们，要永远记着，你们今天的幸福生活，是过去中国人民抗美援朝志愿军，用他们的国际主义精神，拚着鲜血和头颅给你们创造的！”
    这不仅是朝鲜人民的声音，而且是祖国人民的声音，也是全世界人民的声音。还有比这种受到人民的热爱更感到幸福的吗？没有！因为这是人类最大的光荣，最大的快乐。得到这种幸福的人是谁呢？就是被全世界人民所热爱的光荣战士，就是祖国人民心目中的最可爱的人。
