　　I often think that, for more than twenty years, the warriors of Chinese revolutionary literature and culture, under the extreme cruelty and despicable white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries, have remained steadfast, fought heroically, taken the correct path, and established a revolutionary style of writing. This is due to the correct leadership of the wise leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese Communist Party. However, the role of Mr. Lu Xun and Comrade Qiu Bai fighting side by side to shatter the enemy's fog-like literary ideology is also very significant. In particular, the debates on the "third kind of person" and "nationalist literature" were like parting the clouds to see the blue sky for the Chinese literary world at that time. Articles such as Qiu Bai's "Freedom of Literature and the Unfreedom of Writers" even convinced the enemy. All of this is as Mr. Lu Xun wrote in a letter on the night of May 22, 1935, when he learned that Qiu Bai had fallen into the clutches of the Kuomintang: "The matter is extremely certain. I received confirmation last month, but what can be done? This loss to culture is truly unparalleled." This was indeed an irreparable loss to the Chinese people.

　　Let me explain a few things here: "It" is Qiu Bai, a symbol used in letters to friends throughout his life. This name can occasionally be found in "Lu Xun's Letters." It comes from the simplification of "Vita" or "Shi Vita." The latter two names can occasionally be seen on the New Youth Quarterly (changed from a monthly publication) that he edited, starting in 1923. "Shi Vita" and "Shi Tier" are both transliterations of STR (as printed on the spine of "Stories Over the Sea"). STR is an abbreviation of the word STRACHOV, which is the English spelling of Qiu Bai's Russian surname CTPAXOB. "Lu Xun's Letters" occasionally also contains the words "It's Sister-in-law," which refers to Comrade Yang Zhihua, Qiu Bai's wife.

　　For sixteen or seventeen years after Qiu Bai's death, the Chinese revolutionary people, especially the Chinese literary world, have always held a deep feeling of mourning for him. However, apart from the brief records in newspapers at the time, the circumstances of his execution and the aftermath have not been mentioned again until now. Qiu Bai was my greatest teacher and most beneficial friend in my life, and a close confidant through thick and thin. After his death, for more than ten years, whenever I recalled him, his voice, smile, and appearance vividly appeared before me, and my hatred for the enemy who killed him deepened to the bone.

　　For more than ten years, I have often fantasized about how to have the opportunity to pay my respects at Qiu Bai's tomb and the place of his execution, and to conduct interviews about the situation at that time.

　　In July of this year, the Central People's Government organized a Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Group and ordered me to participate. I finally had the opportunity to go to Changting to pay my respects at the place of Qiu Bai's execution.

　　At 9:20 AM on August 24th, we arrived in Changting, the location of the Fujian Soviet Government during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War after 1927.

　　The car drove directly to the County People's Government in West Street. Because we had not contacted the county government in advance, the county chief had gone to the countryside on official business in the morning. We were received by Secretary Zhu Qichang. After we explained our intentions, Secretary Zhu immediately sent someone to invite Zhang Renfu and Liu Yutang.

　　Zhang Renfu is a professional coffin carrier, one of the people who personally dressed Qiu Bai's body and carried his coffin at the time. He is now 58 years old and lives in West Street, Changting. The whereabouts of the other three coffin carriers are currently unknown. Liu Yutang is a poor peasant and dung collector, now 47 years old, who lives in Huangtianbei Village, about five miles from the city. These are the only two eyewitnesses to Qiu Bai's execution that can be found now.

　　To the west of Changting Middle School, there is a small park, then named Lenin Park, which the enemy renamed Zhongshan Park after they occupied it. This is where Qiu Bai had his pre-execution meal.

　　From here, about half a mile west of the city, on the north side of the highway, there is a small mountain called Luohan Ridge. At the foot and on the hillside of the ridge, there are numerous desolate tombs, creating a gloomy atmosphere. In front of the ridge, there is a small lawn that extends directly to the highway. Originally, it was the abandoned site of a nursing home for deaf, blind, and helpless elderly people at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Although it is now a lawn, the foundations of the buildings can still be identified. The center of the lawn is the site of Qiu Bai's execution.

　　From here, less than a mile west, on the north side of the highway, there are rolling hills called Panlong Hill, which is the location of Qiu Bai's tomb. His remains were exhumed by the Changting County Government in July of this year, placed in a porcelain urn, and stored in the county government. Only the tomb remains, with yellow soil and broken bricks piled next to it, the soil color fresh, as if it had been dug up just yesterday. We verbally asked Secretary Zhu to convey the suggestion to the Changting County Government to fill in the tomb, build a cenotaph, and erect a stone tablet as a memorial.

　　According to Zhang Renfu, Comrade Qiu Bai was captured by Zhong Shaokui of the Kuomintang on February 23, 1935, in Shuikou, about ninety miles east of Changting. After being captured, he was taken to Changting and imprisoned in the headquarters of Song Xilian, commander of the pseudo-36th Division of the Fujian Provincial Seventh Middle School in West Street. At that time, the residents did not know who the person being held was.

　　On the morning of June 18 of the same year, the prisoner was escorted to Zhongshan Park for a pre-execution meal. Although there were no soldiers stationed in the park, the gate was heavily guarded because the prisoner was having a pre-execution meal, and residents were not allowed to enter. Therefore, the situation in the park at that time was completely unknown. There was singing heard from across the wall, but it was difficult to discern what song was being sung. It is said that it was the Internationale.

　　At about ten o'clock that morning, the executioners escorted the prisoner to the execution ground, unbound. The prisoner was wearing a short shirt, shorts, and shoes and socks, and his demeanor was calm. When he reached the front of Luohan Ridge, in the middle of the lawn at the foot of the mountain, facing Luohan Ridge, he sat down with his legs crossed. The executioner, a bodyguard of Song Xilian, shot him in the back with a box gun, killing him with one bullet. Afterwards, residents saw a notice and learned that the person who was killed was Comrade Qu Qiubai.

　　After the execution, the body was left exposed until about 4:00 PM, when someone sent a coffin. Zhang Renfu said that he personally helped with the burial and carried the coffin to Panlong Hill for burial.

　　Liu Yutang, the dung collector, said that on that morning, he entered the city to collect dung as usual. When he passed through West Street, he encountered Qiu Bai's execution. His description of the details he witnessed was consistent with Zhang Renfu's.

　　We left Changting at 4:30 PM. In the setting sun, the car slowly drove past Qiu Bai's execution site, heading straight for Ruijin.

　　Luohan Ridge slowly receded behind us... Qiu Bai's face appeared in my mind, and Qiu Bai's voice echoed in my ears...

　　Qiu Bai, it must have been around 1921-1922, when we were in Moscow. Your lung disease was already very serious. The doctor said that one of your lungs was already rotten and that you would only be able to last for three or four years at most. But you always refused to rest. When lecturing, you were sometimes so tired that your face turned pale, and you couldn't even catch your breath, but you still lectured "tirelessly." Later, when you really couldn't continue, you went to recuperate in the suburbs of Moscow. I went to see you almost every Sunday. Every time, you were so excited that you forgot your illness and everything else, and talked eloquently. You said that the Soviet Union was truly a dazzling treasure trove of revolution, and you wanted to risk your weak life to transport more of the revolutionary treasures back to China.

　　At that time, you lay in bed, and since there was no table lamp at the head of the bed, you pulled the pendant lamp to the head of the bed, tied it to the bed frame, and bent over the pillow to write articles. You wanted to tell the fighting Chinese people and the workers of the world about the Soviet Union, which was still a "world mystery" at the time, and about the "humanization of communism" (note). You wanted to expose the imperialists' rumors about the Soviet Union in front of the workers and peasants, so that everyone could distinguish the path clearly and not believe the lies of those bloodsuckers!

　　Qiu Bai, it must have been around 1923, when you returned to China and lived with a member of your clan in the Dongcheng district of Beijing. I went to see you, and once I gave you my first translated manuscript, Chekhov's "The Boor," to read. After you finished reading it, you published it in the New Youth Quarterly that you were editing. That gave me so much encouragement. You taught me to study more and introduce more. You said that the soil of Chinese literature was too barren, and you taught me to be a farmer who carried fertilizer to fertilize the fields.

　　I remember that there was a small harmonium in the room where you lived. You were translating the Internationale. After carefully considering a sentence, you repeatedly played and sang it on the harmonium, trying to make the lyrics appropriately fit the music. You said that there were already three translations of the Internationale, but none of them were good and could be sung. You wanted to translate it in a way that could be sung, so that millions of people could sing it in Chinese.

　　Qiu Bai, in studying Russian, I often discussed the difficulties I encountered, especially those words and phrases where the original meaning was understood but difficult to express well in Chinese. Once, I casually mentioned a very ordinary example in Chekhov's play when two characters were arguing: "Видапи,мы," which I translated directly as "We have seen." You changed it to "We have experienced." These small details, almost thirty years later, I still remember clearly. Adding one word makes it so vivid! Qiu Bai, you could translate extremely dry and abstruse philosophical papers so delicately, euphemistically, and movingly! Through your genius pen, Marxist-Leninist literary theory took root and blossomed in the hearts of Chinese literary readers.

　　Around 1924, when you were in Shanghai, after I sent you my first translated manuscript, Chekhov's "Three Sisters," for you to read, you revised some parts and introduced it to the Literary Research Association for inclusion in its series of publications. You wrote in a letter at the time that you were completely sustaining your life with medicine, engaging in revolutionary work under extremely difficult conditions. I often wrote to you for advice, and you answered every question in detail, some even describing them in lengthy detail.

　　After the failure of the Great Revolution, I fled to Moscow, and you arrived there soon after. Meeting an old friend in a new place, I really didn't know where to start! One evening, we were walking along the Moscow River near the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. You talked about the situation in Wuhan after I left... Comrade Wang Yifei was killed, Comrade Luo Jue was killed... Finally, you talked about China's urgent need for the introduction of Soviet literary works and literary theories, and you taught me to focus my efforts on this work. You said that the introduction of Soviet literary works and literary theories should be completed as a solemn revolutionary political task.

　　It must have been 1929 when I went from Leningrad to Moscow. Before leaving, I went to see you at your place, Lyuks. You were always as enthusiastic and selfless as ever, planning for the Chinese people. You talked about the problem of popularizing literature and art, almost making me miss my train.

　　Was it 1929? Or 1930? The last time you came to Leningrad, we had a pleasant conversation at my home for half a day, not expecting that those meetings would be our last!

　　After you returned to China, until I returned to China in 1933, I often received books and periodicals from you and Mr. Lu Xun that you tried every means to send to me in Leningrad under the Kuomintang reactionary regime's severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Among them were the semi-public or non-public publications that you ran, such as "Literary Guide," "Crossroads," "Literary Monthly," "Outpost," etc. I recognized in those publications your fiery, fighting literary theoretical criticism articles written under the white terror, using different pen names such as Song Yang, Yi Jia, and Fan Yi Jia.

　　At that time, I also constantly sent some Soviet books and newspapers, entrusting Mr. Lu Xun to forward them to you. Sometimes, to prevent the secret agents from confiscating them, I sent two copies of each, or even three copies, in batches, or forwarded them through Western Europe. I exhausted every effort to escape the Kuomintang's confiscation and send the Soviet books and periodicals to you. I remember that when you received Gladkov's novel "Cement," you immediately translated it, and even wrote to tell me: "This book has been translated and handed over to the Commercial Press for publication. When it is published, I will write a preface to be printed in front of the book. This preface only has five big characters: 'Not a Utopia!'" Who knew that that translation, the result of your infinite hard work, was burned by the Japanese imperialist bandits during the Shanghai Battle. Now, only the remaining draft of the first chapter of your manuscript remains. Qiu Bai, your translation was burned by the bandits, but your red heart for the Chinese revolution cannot be burned by the flames of any bandit! Qiu Bai, the "New Land" in your ideal, for this "New Land" you finally generously sacrificed yourself, and this "New Land" has appeared in China under the leadership of the wise Chairman Mao!

　　In the autumn of 1931, I used my summer vacation in Leningrad to finish translating the appendix of "The Iron Flood," but I did not have the time to translate the most important long preface of the book. Mr. Lu Xun was eager to publish the book, so he asked you to translate the preface "under the rock-like pressure." Mr. Lu Xun wrote in a letter to Leningrad at the time: "The long preface of 'The Iron Flood' has been translated by someone else here, someone you know." But he never thought it was you. That was truly the fortune of the author, the fortune of the translator, and the fortune of the broad Chinese readers! That translation, until now, is probably an unprecedented translation. Mr. Lu Xun said in the postscript of the book: "It doesn't matter if there are no woodcut illustrations, but the lack of a good preface is really regrettable. Fortunately, Shi Tier specifically translated Neratov's one for this translation, nearly 20,000 words, which is indeed an extremely important text. If readers carefully study this and the 'How I Wrote the Iron Flood?' attached to the end of the volume several times, it will be of great help not only to the understanding of this book, but also to the understanding of creation and critical theory." Then he said: "Under the current situation, it is not easy to publish a good book. Although this book is a translated novel, it is the result of the combined efforts of three people -- translating, supplementing, and proofreading, and none of them intends to use this to entertain themselves or take the opportunity to deceive readers..."

　　Qiu Bai, in such a dark era, you used a fiery passion to encourage the introduction of Soviet literature. When "The Rout" was published, you wrote to Lu Xun under the pen name J.K., saying:

　　"The publication of your 'The Rout' is of course a very memorable event in Chinese literary life. Translating masterpieces of world proletarian revolutionary literature and systematically introducing them to Chinese readers (especially Soviet masterpieces, because they can dedicate the heroes of the Great October Revolution, the Civil War, and the Five-Year Plan to readers through concrete images and artistic illumination) is one of the important tasks of Chinese proletarian writers. Although almost all the efforts to do this now are only your and Comrade N's efforts; but who can say: this is a private matter?! Who?! The publication of 'The Rout' and 'The Iron Flood' etc. should be regarded as the responsibility of all Chinese revolutionary writers. Every warrior on the revolutionary literary front, every revolutionary reader, should celebrate this victory; although this is only a small victory."

　　Qiu Bai, in the afternoon of February 7, 1934, I arrived in Shanghai and went to Mr. Lu Xun's house, which was not open to the public at the time. After dinner, Mr. Lu Xun led me to a room. Although the room was not very large, it was extremely clean. There was a window in the back, and a long table by the window, covered with a snow-white tablecloth. On the table were sharpened pencils, brushes, inkstones, envelopes, blotting pads, etc. There was a rocking chair in front of the table. A single bed was placed against the back wall. After Mr. Lu Xun stood still, he said calmly and softly: "This is the room where Qiu Bai lived when he was in hiding. All the arrangements are as they were. You will live here..." After saying this, we went to Mr. Lu Xun's study and bedroom on the second floor. A desk was by the window. I sat on the rattan lounge chair on the right side of the desk, and Mr. Lu Xun sat on the swivel chair in front of the desk. Guangping sat on the left side of the desk. Mr. Lu Xun continued calmly and softly, recalling as he spoke: "...That is the room where Qiu Bai lived when he was in hiding. He was constantly searched and chased by hunting dogs. He fled everywhere like a groundhog. Sometimes he moved three or four times a day. Sometimes, when he was chased to the point of desperation, he jumped onto a jeep, circled around a few times, and then got off halfway and walked. When it was most dangerous, he fled here and lived in the room where you are living... He waited for a long time, but he didn't wait for you. He couldn't wait any longer and went over there." He habitually blurted out the words "over there," and then, realizing that he was speaking at home, he added: "He went to the Soviet area." After a pause, he continued: "You came, and he left..." I only felt heavy, and I couldn't speak. With a heavy heart, I stared at Mr. Lu Xun's thoughtful face, thinking in my heart: "Sir, you are using your own life, in the most dangerous situation, to protect a Bolshevik!..."

　　What violence in the universe can damage such revolutionary friendship!

　　Qiu Bai was gone, and Mr. Lu Xun missed him deeply, holding a feeling of regret. In a letter on January 19, 1935, he said: "His sister-in-law is safe, but her brother is traveling to and fro, I wonder how his body is."

　　After Qiu Bai was killed, Mr. Lu Xun, in his grief, used "Zhu Xia Huai Shuang Society" to compile and print "Stories Over the Sea" as a memorial. In a letter on January 5, 1936, he said: "We are printing a collection of his translations, about 300,000 words in the first volume, which is being proofread and will be completed in early summer."

　　In a letter on May 17, 1936, he said: "His collection has been typeset... Almost all of them have been published before, but in any case, with this, his translations can be considered to have an ending."

　　In a letter on August 27, 1936, he said: "The upper volume of his collection is being bound and will soon be completed. It is quite good. If he were alive, he would be happy to see it, but now he has returned to the soil. Alas."

　　But, Qiu Bai, the "New Land" that you strived for has been realized under the leadership of Chairman Mao. On your "New Land," the miraculous flowers of the Chinese people's victory that are envied by hundreds of millions of people around the world are blooming everywhere. These miraculous flowers are irrigated with your own blood and the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs.

　　Qiu Bai, this is as you wanted to write in large characters twenty years ago: "Not a Utopia!"

    纪念鲁迅先生逝世十五周年
    罗汉岭前吊秋白并忆鲁迅先生
    曹靖华
    我常想，二十多年来，中国革命文艺及革命文化的战士们，在国民党反动派的极端残暴卑鄙的白色恐怖下，始终坚贞不屈，英勇战斗，走上正确道路，树起革命文风，是由于中国人民的英明领袖毛主席及中国共产党的正确领导；而鲁迅先生与秋白同志并肩奋战，粉碎了敌人的迷雾似的文艺思想的作用，也是很大的。尤其是对第三种人及对“民族主义文学”的论战，对中国当时文坛，确是如拨云雾而见青天。像秋白的“文艺的自由和文学家的不自由”等几篇文章，连敌人也不能不折服。这些都诚如鲁迅先生得悉秋白落入国民党魔爪中时，在一九三五年五月二十二日夜来函所云：“它事极确，上月弟曾得确信，然何能为。这在文化上的损失，真是无可比喻。”这确是中国人民不能弥补的大损失。
    这里顺便说明几句：“它”是秋白，是生平与友人通信用的符号，“鲁迅书简”中偶尔可以遇到这样的名字。这是由“维它”或“史维它”简化而来。后两名从一九二三年起，在他主编的新青年季刊（由月刊改的）上，偶尔可以见到。而“史维它”及“史铁儿”，均由STR（如“海上述林”书脊上所印者）之音译而来。STR则为STRACHOV一字的缩写，也就是秋白俄文姓CTPAXOB之英文拼音。“鲁迅书简”中偶尔还可遇到 “它嫂”两字，这就是称秋白爱人杨之华同志的。
    秋白被害后，十六七年来，中国革命人民，尤其是中国文艺界，始终怀着悼念他的沉痛的心情。但对他就义时的情景及就义后的种种，除当时报纸略作记述外，至今再未见提及。秋白是我生平受教最大的严师益友，也是冰雪中过从甚密的相知。他被害后，十余年来，再一忆及，他的声音笑貌，就活现目前，而对杀他的敌人，则更恨入骨髓了。
    十余年来，时时幻想着怎能有机会去凭吊一下秋白墓及就义地，并对当时的情况作一番访问呢。
    今年七月，中央人民政府组织了南方老根据地访问团，令我参加。我才有机会赴长汀凭吊秋白就义地。
    八月二十四日晨九时二十分抵长汀，这是一九二七年后，第二次国内革命战争时，福建苏维埃政府所在地。
    车直驶西街县人民政府。因事先未与县府联系，县长早晨即因公下乡，由朱其昌秘书招待。我们述明来意后，朱秘书立即派人邀了张仁福、刘玉堂两位来。
    张仁福是职业抬棺人，是当时亲殓秋白，替秋白抬棺人之一，现年五十八岁，住长汀西街。其他三个抬棺人现已无下落。刘玉堂是贫农，拾粪人，现年四十七岁，住距城约五里之黄田背村。这是现在能找到的秋白就义时仅有的两个目击人。
    长汀中学西，有一小公园，当时名列宁公园，敌人占领后，改名为中山公园。这是秋白就义前用刑餐的地方。
    由此往西，距城约半里许，公路北有小山一座，名罗汉岭，岭脚及山腰处，荒冢累累，气象阴森。岭前有一小草坪，直抵公路。原为清末收容聋盲无依老人之养济院废址，现虽成草坪，但尚有屋基可辨。草坪正中即秋白就义地。
    由此往西，不及一里处，公路以北，丘陵起伏，名盘龙岗，为秋白墓穴所在地。遗骸今年七月已由长汀县府起出，装入瓷坛内，存县府。墓仅剩一穴，黄土乱砖，堆积穴旁，土色新鲜，宛如昨日所掘者。当时曾口头请朱秘书转达，建议长汀县府，将遗穴填起，修一衣冠冢，并立碑石，留作纪念。
    据张仁福说：秋白同志是一九三五年二月二十三日，在长汀东约九十里之水口被国民党钟绍葵所俘。被俘后，押至长汀，囚西街福建省立第七中学伪三十六师宋希濂司令部内。当时居民均不知被押者为何人。
    同年六月十八日上午，将囚人押至中山公园吃刑餐，园内虽未住兵，但因囚人用刑餐，门禁森严，居民不能入内，故当时园中情况，一概不知。隔墙听有歌声，至所唱何歌，也难辨别。据云所唱者为国际歌。
    当日上午约十点钟，刑兵将囚人押往刑场，未绑。囚人着小衫，短裤，鞋袜，意态从容。行至罗汉岭前，靠山脚处草坪正中间，面对罗汉岭，盘足而坐。刑兵即宋希濂卫士，用盒子枪由背后射击，一弹毙命。事后，居民见布告，始知被害人为瞿秋白同志。
    被难后露尸至午后四时左右，始有人送棺木一具，张仁福说，他亲自代为装殓，并抬至盘龙岗埋葬。
    拾粪人刘玉堂说，他当日上午，同平常一样，入城拾粪，由西街经过时，正遇秋白就义。所述目击详情，与张仁福无出入。
    午后四时半离开长汀。夕阳里，汽车徐徐的驶过了秋白的就义地，直向瑞金驶去了。
    罗汉岭慢慢的留在身后……秋白的面影，浮现到我的心头，秋白的音浪，激荡着我的耳膜……
    秋白，那大约是一九二一——二二年吧，我们在莫斯科，你的肺病已经很严重了，医生说你的一叶肺已经烂了，说你顶多不过支持三几年。但你总不肯休息。讲课时，有时累得面色苍白，连气都接不上来了，但你还是‘诲人不倦’地讲下去。后来真支持不下去了，就在莫斯科近郊疗养，我几乎每星期日都去看你，你每次都是兴奋得忘了病，忘了一切，口若悬河地谈论着。你说苏联真是一座琳琅满目的革命的宝山，你要拚着你的病弱的生命，把革命的宝贝更多地运回中国来。
    你那时躺到床上，床头没有台灯，你就把吊灯拉到床头，拴到床架上，俯到枕上写文章。你要把当时还是“世界之谜”的苏联实况，把“共产主义的人间化（注）”告诉给斗争中的中国人民，告诉给世界劳动者。你要在工农大众面前，把帝国主义者对苏联的谣言揭穿，叫大家辨清道路，不要信那些吸血虫的鬼话！
    秋白，那大约在一九二三年吧，你回国住在北京东城你的一个本家那里。我去看你，有一次我把我的第一篇译稿——柴霍甫的“蠢货”交给你看，你看毕就在你主编的新青年季刊上发表了。那给了我多大的鼓舞呵。你教我多学习，多介绍。你说中国文艺土壤太贫瘠了，教我作一个搬运肥料的肥田的农夫。
    我记得，你住的房间里有一张小风琴。你正在译国际歌，斟酌好了一句，就在风琴上反复地自弹自唱，要使歌词恰当的合乎乐谱。你说国际歌已经有了三种译文，但是没有一种译得好，而且能够唱的。你要把它译得能唱，让千万人能用中文唱出来。
    秋白，在学习俄文中，我常把所遇到的困难，特别是原意懂而中文不易表达得好的那些词句，同你商量。有一次，我随便提到柴霍甫的剧本中两个人物吵嘴时那样最普通的例：“Видапи，мы”，我照直译为“我们见过的”，你改为“我们见识过的”。这些小节，将近三十年了，我还记得清清楚楚。加一个字，显得多么生动！秋白，你能把极枯燥艰深的哲学论文，译述得那么细腻，委婉，动人！马列主义的文艺理论文章，透过你的天才的笔，在中国广大的文艺读者的心中生根，开花了。
    大约是一九二四年吧，你在上海，我把我译的第一部译稿——柴霍甫的“三姊妹”，寄给你看了之后，改了一些地方，就介绍给文学研究会列入丛书出版了。你当时写信说你完全用药养着命，在极端艰险条件下，从事革命工作。我时常写信向你请教，每个问题你都详细地解答，有些简直是长篇大论地详述。
    大革命失败后，我逃到莫斯科，不久你也到了那里。旧地逢故人，真不知话从那里说起！一天傍晚，我们在大教堂附近的莫斯科河畔散步，你谈到我走后武汉各方面的情况……王一飞同志被害了，罗觉同志被害了……最后你谈到中国极需要苏联的文艺作品与文艺理论的介绍，你教我专力在这方面工作。你说应当把介绍苏联文艺作品与文艺理论，当作庄严的革命的政治任务来完成。
    那是一九二九年吧，我由列宁格勒到莫斯科，临走前到你住的地方——柳克斯去看你。你总是像从来那样的昂奋，那样忘我地为中国人民打算。你谈起文艺大众化问题，谈得几乎使我误了火车。
    那是一九二九年呢？一九三○年呢？你最后一次到了列宁格勒，在我家里畅叙半日，不意那些相会，竟成了我们最后一次的会见！
    你回国后，一直到一九三三年我回国以前，我经常收到你同鲁迅先生在国民党反动政权对苏绝交的情况下，想尽方法给我往列宁格勒寄书刊。其中有你们办的半公开，或不公开的刊物，如“文学导报”，“十字街头”，“文学月报”，“前哨”等等。我在那些刊物上辨出了你在白色恐怖下，用宋阳，易嘉，范易嘉等等不同的笔名，写出了火热的，战斗的文艺理论批评的文章。
    我那时也不断寄些苏联的书报，托鲁迅先生转给你，有时为防特务没收，每种寄双份，甚至寄三份，分批寄，或经西欧转寄。用尽心思要逃过国民党的没收，把苏联的书刊寄到你手里。记得你收到格拉特柯夫的长篇“新地”时，立即译了出来，并且还写信告诉我说：“这书已译好，交商务印行，出版时，我要写一篇序文印在书前，这序文只有五个大字，就是：‘并非乌托邦！’”谁知你无限心血凝成的那部译稿，沪战时，竟被日本帝国主义强盗烧毁了。现在仅剩你遗稿中的第一章的残稿。秋白，你的译稿被强盗烧毁了，但是，你替中国革命打算的一颗赤心，任何强盗的烈火都烧不毁的！秋白，你理想中的“新地”，为了这“新地”你终于慷慨以身殉之，这“新地”，在英明的毛主席的领导下，在中国出现了！
    一九三一年秋天的时候，我在列宁格勒利用暑假，译完了“铁流”的附录部分，没有功夫再将该书最主要的一篇长序译出来。鲁迅先生又急着将书出版，于是就请你在那“岩石似的重压下”，将那篇序文译了出来。鲁迅先生当时往列宁格勒去信说：“铁流长序在此已另请人译，那人你是认识的。”但却没想到是你。那真是作者之幸，译者之幸，中国广大读者之幸呵！那译文，直到现在为止，恐怕是空前的译笔了。鲁迅先生在该书编校后记中说：“没有木刻的插图还不要紧，而缺少一篇好的序文，却实在觉得有些缺憾。幸而，史铁儿竟特地为了这译本而将涅拉陀夫的那一篇翻译出来了，将近二万言，确是一篇极重要的文字。读者倘将这和附在卷末的‘我怎样写铁流的？’都仔细地研读几回，则不但对本书的理解，就是对于创作，批评理论的理解，也有很大帮助的。”接着又说：“在现状之下，很不容易出一本较好的书，这书虽然是一种翻译小说，但却是尽三人的微力而成，——译的译，补的补，校的校，而又没有一个是存着借此来自己消闲，或乘机哄骗读者的意思的………”
    秋白，在那样阴暗的时代，你都是用烈火一般的热情，来鼓舞对苏联文学的介绍。当“毁灭”出版的时候，你用J·K·的笔名，给鲁迅写信说：
    “你的‘毁灭’的出版，当然是中国文艺生活里面的极可纪念的事迹。翻译世界无产阶级革命文学的名著，并且有系统地介绍给中国读者，（尤其是苏联的名著，因为它们能够于伟大的十月，国内战争，五年计划的英雄，经过具体的形象，经过艺术的照耀，而供献给读者。）这是中国普罗文学者的重要任务之一。虽然，现在做这件事的，差不多完全只是你和N同志的努力；可是，谁能够说：这是私人的事情？！谁？！‘毁灭’和‘铁流’等等的出版，应当认为一切中国革命文学家的责任，每一个革命的文学战线上的战士，每一个革命的读者，应当庆祝这一个胜利；虽然这还只是小小的胜利。”
    秋白，一九三四年二月七日的午后，我到了上海，到了当时不公开的鲁迅先生的家里。晚饭后，鲁迅先生把我引到一个房间里。那房间虽不很大，但却极整洁。后面有一个窗子，靠窗有一张条棹，棹上铺着雪白的棹布。棹上放着削好了的铅笔，毛笔，墨盒，信封，拍纸簿等。棹前放着一张靠椅。靠后墙放着一张单人床。鲁迅先生站定之后，从容而低沉地说：“这是秋白逃难住的房间，一切布置照旧，你就住在这里吧……”说毕我们就又到了二楼鲁迅先生的书房而兼作卧室里。靠窗是一张书棹。我坐在棹右边的藤躺椅上，鲁迅先生坐在棹前的转椅上，棹左边坐的是广平。鲁迅先生一面回想着，一面从容而低沉地继续说：“……那是秋白逃难住的房间。他不断受猎犬搜索，追逐。他像地老鼠似地到处逃。有时一天迁三四个地方。有时被追逐到不得已时，跳上野鸡汽车，兜几个圈子，到半路再下来走。到最危险的时候，就逃到这里，住到你住的那个房间里……他等了好久，没有等着你，不能再等了，到那边去了。”他习惯成自然地随口说出了“那边”两个字之后，想到是在家里说的，于是接着又补充了一句：“到苏区去了。”停顿了一下，接着说：“你来了，他去了……”我只感到沉重，口里说不出话来。我怀着沉重的心情，凝视着鲁迅先生的沉思的面孔，心里想着：“先生，你用自己的生命，在最危险的情况下，来庇护一个布尔塞维克！……”
    这样的革命的友情，宇宙间什么暴力能够折损呢！
    秋白走了，鲁迅先生念念不忘地怀着惜别的心情。他在一九三五年一月十九日的信中说：“它嫂平安，唯它兄仆仆道涂，不知身体如何耳。”
    秋白被害后，鲁迅先生在悲痛之余，用“诸夏怀霜社”来编印“海上述林”作纪念。在一九三六年一月五日的信中说：“我们正为它兄印一译述文字的集子，第一本约三十万字，正校对，夏初可成。”
    一九三六年五月十七日信中说：“它兄集已排完……几乎都是发表过的，然无论如何，这么一来，他的译文，总算有一结束了。”
    一九三六年八月二十七日函中说：“它兄集上卷已在装订，不久可成，颇好，倘其生存，见之当亦高兴，而今竟已归土，哀哉。”
    但是，秋白，你所努力的“新地”，在毛主席领导下实现了。你的“新地”上开遍了使全世界亿万人羡慕的中国人民胜利的奇花。这奇花是用你自己的和无数革命先烈的鲜血灌溉出来的。
    秋白，这诚如二十年前你所要大书特书的：“并非乌托邦！”
