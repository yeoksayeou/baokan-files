Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: According to a TASS dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th: Tokyo Radio reported that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida delivered a policy address during the preliminary debate at the Japanese Diet Lower House meeting on the 12th.

Yoshida mainly talked about the separate peace treaty with Japan signed in San Francisco and the U.S.-Japan military agreement. He demanded that the Diet approve the separate treaty "without reservation." Yoshida attempted to portray the aggressive U.S.-Japan military agreement as some kind of "defensive" measure.

Yoshida said: The government will later submit supplementary budget proposals and other bills to the Diet. It is well known that the purpose of these bills is to further fascisize and militarize Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Yoshida cabinet approved the supplementary budget案 for this year on October 5th, and the proposal will be submitted to the Japanese Diet, which is currently in session, for approval. This supplementary budget案 was prepared in accordance with the United States' plan to rearm Japan after the separate peace treaty. Of the total expenditure of more than 136.2 billion yen (360 yen equals one U.S. dollar), military expenses account for a large proportion. For example, the cost of maintaining and strengthening the so-called "Police Reserve Force" amounts to 15 billion yen. Adding the 16 billion yen originally allocated to the "Police Reserve Force" in this year's Japanese general accounting budget案, the team's funding for this year will increase to 31 billion yen. The supplementary budget案 also stipulates 170 million yen for "Maritime Safety Agency" expenses and 1 billion yen to be used as operating expenses for the "Special Examination Bureau," a special agency that expands the persecution of democratic elements.

At the same time, the Yoshida Cabinet also stipulated hundreds of billions of yen in new appropriations in the supplementary budget案 under the names of "post-peace restoration expenses" and "financial investment." Most of these funds will be used to maintain U.S. troops stationed in Japan and rearm Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, October 12th: Tokyo dispatch: In order to step up the suppression of the people's peace movement, the Japanese Yoshida reactionary government continues to take various illegal means to persecute the Japanese Communist Party and democratic newspapers.

On October 9th, the Japanese Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, under the pretext of searching for "illegal publications," conducted searches nationwide with the assistance of a large number of police. More than 300 places were searched. The police illegally arrested 22 people and confiscated many progressive newspapers. According to a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th, since the "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper was suspended last June, approximately 2,000 kinds of progressive newspapers have been investigated and closed down.

On October 8th, Japanese police also searched four organizations of the Japanese Communist Party in Nagano Prefecture.

    在日本国会众院会议上
    吉田无耻要求批准单独和约
    日警继续大规模搜查民主报刊
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社十三日讯：据东京电台说，日本首相吉田十二日在日本国会众院会议举行初步辩论时发表了施政演说。
    吉田主要谈到在旧金山签订的单独对日和约和美日军事协定。他要求国会“无保留地”批准单独和约。吉田试图把侵略性的美日军事协定说成是某种“防御”措施。
    吉田说：政府以后将向国会提出追加预算案和其他一些法案。大家知道，这些法案的目的在于使日本进一步法西斯化和军国主义化。
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：日本吉田内阁已在十月五日批准本年度追加预算案，该案将提交正在举行会议的日本国会批准。这一追加预算案是按照单独媾和后美国重新武装日本的计划编制的。在总额达一千三百六十二亿多日元（三百六十日元合一美元）的支出中，军事性的费用占很大部分。例如，用于维持和加强所谓“警察后备队”的费用达一百五十亿日元。加上“警察后备队”在本年度日本一般会计预算案中原已获得的一百六十亿日元的拨款，该队本年度的经费将增为三百十亿日元。追加预算案还规定一亿七千万日元为“海上保安厅”费用，十亿日元用来作为扩大迫害民主分子的特务机关——“特别审查局”的活动经费。
    同时，吉田内阁并以“恢复和平善后处理费”、“财政投资”等名义，在追加预算案中规定数百亿日元的新的拨款。这些款项大部分将用来维持驻日美军和重新武装日本。
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：日本吉田反动政府为了加紧镇压人民的和平运动，继续采取各种非法手段迫害日本共产党和民主报刊。
    十月九日，日本最高检察厅以搜查“非法刊物”为口实，在大批警察的协助之下，在全国范围进行搜查。被搜查的场所在三百处以上。警察并非法逮捕了二十二人和没收许多进步报刊。据共同社东京九日电承认，自去年六月“赤旗报”被停刊以来，陆续被检举和封闭的进步报刊约达二千种。
    十月八日，日本警察并在长野县搜查了日本共产党的四个机关。
