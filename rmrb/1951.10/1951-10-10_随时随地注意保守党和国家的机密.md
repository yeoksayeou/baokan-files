    A Brief Review of Party Life
    Preserving the secrets of the Party and the state is the responsibility of every Party member and revolutionary worker. However, many Party members still adopt an intolerable liberal attitude towards this. Huang Keou of the Shanghai Municipal Committee once exposed a comrade wearing the badge of the Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate who was reading internal Party documents on a public bus. At the time, Comrade Huang immediately dissuaded him, but that comrade replied, "Can't I read it?" and continued to read. This situation reflects the emotions of pride, arrogance, and complacency towards the enemy that are growing in some comrades. This serious manifestation of liberalism has, to varying degrees, endangered the interests of the Party and the state, allowing the enemy to exploit loopholes. Therefore, Huang Keou's exposure of this erroneous behavior is completely correct. Chairman Mao once earnestly warned us: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They are bound to fight us to the death, and we must never underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise the question and understand the question in this way now, we shall commit the gravest mistakes." Every Party member and revolutionary cadre should remember this instruction, never forget it for a moment, and always maintain vigilance against the enemy.

    随时随地注意保守党和国家的机密
    保守党和国家的机密，是每一个党员和革命工作者的责任。但是有不少的党员对此仍采取不可容忍的自由主义的态度。上海市委会黄克欧曾揭发一位身佩上海市人民检察署徽章的同志，在公共汽车上翻阅党的内部文件。当时黄同志即加劝阻，那位同志却回答：“难道不能看吗？”竟继续看下去。这种情况反映了在某些同志中滋长着的骄傲自大、轻敌麻痹的情绪。这种严重的自由主义现象，曾经在不同程度上危害了党和国家的利益，使敌人钻了空子。因此，黄克欧揭发这种错误行为是完全正确的。毛主席曾谆谆告诫我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人，如果我们现在不去这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”每一个党员和革命干部都应当熟记这一指示，一时一刻也不要忘记，永远保持对敌人的警惕性。
