[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th] On October 16th at 10:00 AM, liaison officers from both sides continued their talks to discuss the resumption of meetings between the two delegations. At the beginning of the liaison officers' meeting on October 10th, the liaison officer from the other side requested the Korean-Chinese delegation to guarantee no attacks on the passage from Munsan to Panmunjom, and a circular area with a radius of 3,000 yards centered on the Munsan United Nations Command delegation's residence. At the same time, the liaison officer from the other side claimed that the United Nations Command delegation was willing to guarantee no attacks on the passage from Kaesong to Munsan, and a circular area with a radius of 3,000 yards centered on Kaesong. However, the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement still exists, and the neutral status of the passage between Kaesong and Panmunjom, as well as the circular area with a radius of five miles around Kaesong, does not require separate guarantees. Therefore, on October 12th, our liaison officer proposed that before an agreement is reached on expanding the neutral zone to include Kaesong, Panmunjom, and Munsan, neither side should engage in any hostile acts in the Munsan-Panmunjom passage and the Munsan area, so that the United Nations Command delegation could come to Panmunjom to resume meetings. However, the liaison officer from the other side firmly disagreed, claiming that this proposal did not conform to the principle of equality between the two sides. In order to eliminate all excuses for the other side to delay the resumption of meetings between the two delegations, our liaison officer formally proposed to the other side during the discussion before the adjournment at 11:26 AM on October 16th: The Korean-Chinese delegation agrees that for the circular area with a radius of five miles centered on the Munsan United Nations Command delegation's residence, and the area of 1.5 miles on both sides of the Munsan-Panmunjom passage, all armed forces of both sides will not engage in any hostile acts. Our liaison officer also pointed out that the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement cannot be changed by the liaison officers before the two delegations resume meetings. However, the liaison officer from the other side still insisted on the proposal put forward by the other side on October 10th at the meeting that started at 2:00 PM, attempting to tamper with the existing Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement, so that the October 16th meeting still failed to enter the discussion of the specific date and time for the resumption of meetings between the two delegations, obstructing the rapid resumption of meetings between the two delegations. The October 16th meeting ended at 3:50 PM. The liaison officers from both sides agreed to continue talks at 10:00 AM on October 17th.

    双方联络官继续会谈复会事宜
    美方图窜改现行开城中立区协议
    继续阻挠双方代表团的迅速复会 【新华社开城十六日电】十月十六日上午十时，双方联络官继续会谈，协商双方代表团复会事宜。在十月十日双方联络官会议开始时，对方联络官即要求朝中代表团方面保证不攻击汶山至板门店的通道，及以汶山联合国军代表团驻地为中心三千码为半径的圆形区域。同时，对方联络官声称：联合国军代表团方面愿意保证不攻击开城至汶山的通道，及以开城为中心三千码为半径的圆形区域。但开城中立区协议依然存在，开城、板门店间的通道以及开城周围以五英里为半径的圆形区域的中立地位，无须另行保证。因此，我方联络官在十月十二日提议在扩大中立区，使之包括开城、板门店、汶山尚未达成协议之前，对于汶山、板门店通道及汶山区域，双方不进行任何敌对行为，以便联合国军代表团前来板门店复会。但对方联络官却又以此项方案不合双方平等的原则为词坚不同意。为解除对方拖延双方代表团复会的一切藉口，我方联络官在十月十六日上午十一时二十六分休会前的讨论中，向对方正式提出：朝中代表团方面，同意对于以汶山联合国军代表团驻地为中心五英里为半径的圆形区域，以及汶山、板门店通道两侧各一英里半的地区，双方一切武装力量，不进行任何敌对行为。我方联络官并指出：开城中立区协议不能在双方代表团复会前，由联络官予以更改。但对方联络官却在下午二时开始的会上，仍然坚持对方在十月十日所提出的方案，企图窜改现行开城中立区的协议，以致十月十六日的会议仍未能进入双方代表团具体复会的日期与时间的讨论，阻挠了双方代表团的迅速复会。十六日的会议在下午三时五十分结束。双方联络官约定在十月十七日上午十时继续会谈。
