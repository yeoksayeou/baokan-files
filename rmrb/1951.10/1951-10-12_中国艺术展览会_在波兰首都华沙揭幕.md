Xinhua News Agency, 11th. Warsaw dispatch: Following the "New China Exposition," the "Chinese Art Exhibition" opened in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, on the 1st. Those attending the opening ceremony included Polish Deputy Speakers of Parliament Barsikowski and Kozhikowski, members of the Polish Parliament, Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski, Minister of Culture and Art Dibowski, other heads of the Polish government, representatives of the Polish United Workers' Party and other democratic parties, representatives of mass organizations, representatives of the cultural and artistic circles, and diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, totaling more than 300 people. General Peng Mingzhi, the Chinese ambassador to Poland, also attended the opening ceremony. Polish Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski delivered the opening speech, saying that the exhibition is a microcosm of ancient and modern China. Many outstanding modern artworks reflect the great Chinese people's struggle for peace, democracy, and a happy future. From here, one can understand how modern Chinese artists are carrying out the literary and artistic tasks instructed by Mao Zedong. He emphasized that today's China has become a major force in the Far East, and despite the shameless lies of the American imperialists, no problem related to the Far East, no matter how small, can be solved without China's participation. Chinese Ambassador to Poland Peng Mingzhi said in his speech that this exhibition is the fourth exhibition introducing New China held in Warsaw in the past five months, and the second New China exhibition held in the past half month. This shows that the friendship and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Polish people are constantly developing. After the opening ceremony, the participants visited the exhibits, and they unanimously praised the brilliant achievements of Chinese art.

Note: The "Chinese Art Exhibition" displays more than 1,000 exhibits, including painted pottery from the Yangshao culture to artworks from the late Qing Dynasty, as well as modern Chinese paintings, art photography, New Year pictures, woodcuts, etc. Before being exhibited in Warsaw, these exhibits were successively exhibited in Moscow, Leningrad, Berlin, and other cities.
