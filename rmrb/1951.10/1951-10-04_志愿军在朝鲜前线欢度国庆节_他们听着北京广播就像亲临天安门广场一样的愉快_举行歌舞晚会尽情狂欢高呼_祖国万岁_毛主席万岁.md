Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd: Our correspondent reports: The Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front celebrated the National Day of the motherland. On October 1st, before dawn, the front lines were already bustling. A soldier from the suburbs of Beijing joyfully said as soon as he woke up, "My mother should be wearing new clothes and going to Tiananmen Square to see Chairman Mao!" In many shelters, soldiers hung pictures of Chairman Mao on the walls. Soldiers of the "Daofeng Battalion" and "Foguoshan Company" of a certain unit stuck the pennants given by the Korean people in hidden places on the positions. Soldiers who had made contributions to defending peace wore their "military medals," usually wrapped in silk, on their chests. In the battlefield clubs, special National Day issues of the quick reports were posted. Soldier Ding Rongzheng wrote on the quick report: "The motherland, the motherland, is so strong. With you, we are not afraid of any enemies." On the eve of the festival, the artillerymen polished their cannons. At dawn on the festival, they fired many shells at the enemy positions, killing and wounding many enemies. They excitedly said, "Let this be our salute to celebrate National Day!" After 9:00 a.m., commanders and soldiers of some units gathered around radios to listen to the live broadcast of the National Day celebration ceremony held in Tiananmen Square in the capital. They felt as happy as if they were at Tiananmen Square. When they heard the broadcaster report that the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers were walking onto the reviewing stand, they felt extremely honored and proud. In the trenches, soldiers held small-scale discussion meetings in groups of three or five. They put a map of the motherland on the table and talked about the glorious achievements of the motherland in various fields over the past two years. Many soldiers took out letters from home and told their comrades about the bumper harvests and improved family lives in their hometowns after the implementation of land reform. Two days before National Day, soldier Li Haiting received a letter from his mother from Sichuan. His mother told him in the letter how the People's Government cared about the lives of the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers and helped his family with the autumn harvest. On this day, enemy planes bombed and strafed the positions above with particular frenzy. The soldiers said angrily, "It is even more glorious to kill the enemy and make meritorious deeds on National Day." They not only bravely repelled the enemy's ground attacks, but also severely punished the aerial bandits. In the area west of Lianchuan, two "Mustang" American planes swooped down and strafed a certain mountain held by our army. As it was about to turn and ascend, various firearms on the position fired together, hitting one of them and setting it on fire. The soldiers happily said, "Let's offer this small victory as a gift to celebrate National Day!" On the positions where the Chinese and Korean People's forces were fighting side by side to block the enemy, there was also a festive joy. Soldiers of the Korean People's Army collected various wildflowers and presented them to the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. They wished "China and Mao Zedong a long and boundless life." People near the war zone braved the artillery fire to bring chestnuts, apples and other慰问品 (condolences/gifts) to the Chinese People's Volunteers. The people of one village specially presented a red flag to a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed on a certain mountain. They wrote on the red flag: "Great China is the sun of the East." In the evening, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers held song and dance parties in the hidden parts of the positions. They twisted the秧歌 (yangge) dance and sang songs to their hearts' content, shouting "Long Live the Motherland!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

    志愿军在朝鲜前线欢度国庆节
    他们听着北京广播就像亲临天安门广场一样的愉快
    举行歌舞晚会尽情狂欢高呼“祖国万岁”“毛主席万岁”
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】本社记者报道：我国志愿军在朝鲜前线阵地上欢度祖国的国庆节。十月一日，天还没亮，前线阵地上就沸腾起来了。一位家住在北京市郊的战士一起床就欢乐地说：“这时候我的妈妈该穿上新衣裳到天安门前去看毛主席了！”许多掩蔽部里，战士们在壁上挂起了毛主席的像片。某部“道峰营”和“佛国山连”的战士们把朝鲜人民赠送的锦旗插在阵地的隐蔽处。曾为保卫和平立下功勋的战士们都把平日用绸子包着的“军功章”佩戴在胸前。在战地俱乐部里，张贴着庆祝国庆节专号的快报。战士丁荣征在快报上面写着：“祖国祖国真强大，我们有了你，什么敌人也不怕。”炮兵们在节日前夕将炮身擦亮，等到节日的黎明时分，他们就向敌人阵地连发许多炮弹，杀伤了很多敌人。他们兴奋地说：“这就算是我们庆祝国庆节的礼炮吧！”上午九点多钟，有些单位的指挥员和战士们便围坐在收音机旁收听在首都天安门广场举行国庆庆祝典礼的实况。他们的心情像亲临天安门广场一样的愉快。当他们听到广播员报告志愿军的英雄走上观礼台时，他们感到无比的光荣与骄傲。在战壕里，战士们三五成群地举行着小型座谈会。他们在桌上放着一张祖国的地图，漫谈着祖国两年来各方面的光辉成就。许多战士从口袋里掏出家信，向自己的战友讲述他们故乡实行土地改革以后庄稼丰收和家庭生活改善的状况。战士李海亭在国庆节的前两天收到了他母亲远从四川寄来的家信。他母亲在信上告诉他人民政府关心志愿军家属生活、帮助他家收秋的情形。这一天敌机特别疯狂地在阵地的上空轰炸扫射。战士们愤怒地说：“今天是国庆节，杀敌立功更光荣。”他们不仅英勇地击退了敌人地面的进攻，并且严厉地惩罚了空中强盗。在涟川以西地区上空，两架“野马式”美国飞机向我军扼守的某山头俯冲扫射。当它正想转身上升时，阵地上的各种火器一齐发射，将其中的一架击中起火。战士们高兴地说：“这个小小的胜利作为庆祝国庆节的献礼吧！”在中朝人民部队并肩阻击敌军的阵地上，也洋溢着节日的欢欣。朝鲜人民军的战士采集了各种野花献给志愿军的战士。他们祝福“中国和毛泽东万寿无疆”。战区附近的朝鲜人民冒着炮火给志愿军送来栗子、苹果等慰问品。有一个村子的人民特意将一面红旗献给扼守在某山头的志愿军某部。他们在红旗上面写着：“伟大的中国是东方的太阳”。傍晚，志愿军的战士们在阵地上的隐蔽部里举行了歌舞晚会。他们尽情地扭着秧歌，唱着歌曲，欢呼着“祖国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
