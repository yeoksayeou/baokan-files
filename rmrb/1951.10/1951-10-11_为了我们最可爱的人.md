    For Our Most Beloved People
    Model Medical Worker of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army  Tian Maoxiang
    The medical and health workers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, like the combat heroes on the front lines, possess a high degree of political consciousness and revolutionary humanitarianism. They serve the wounded and sick wholeheartedly, and when necessary, they will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to preserve the lives of their wounded and sick comrades.
    During the Fourth Battle, Song Guanqun, a doctor at a forward field hospital, under the dangerous conditions of strafing and bombing by four enemy planes, and nurse Chen Shuzhi rushed into the burning ward four times in a row, rescuing eight seriously wounded soldiers. As he prepared to rescue the ninth and tenth, both he and Chen Shuzhi were wounded, and enemy fire broke his right arm. But at that moment, what he thought about was not himself, but the safety of the wounded and sick. The nineteen-year-old nurse Zhao Yuhua, who was posthumously recognized as a model Communist Party member, is the best example of revolutionary humanitarianism. Life on the Korean front was extremely difficult. Food and vegetables in the hospital were given to the wounded and sick first. Due to enemy aircraft harassment, they had to work day and night. Zhao Yuhua, because she was too busy, had gone four days and nights without sleep, and had not eaten a hot meal on time. To save the life of a soldier who had lost too much blood, she did not hesitate to give him 200 cc of blood. The leadership told her to rest, but she said, "With work so busy, I can't rest." The very next morning, while caring for the wounded and sick, two enemy planes took her young life. One Zhao Yuhua fell, but more Zhao Yuhuas stood up. Soon after, in the same reception company, there emerged nurse Hu Wenxing, who also insisted on not sleeping for several days and nights, giving 150 cc of blood to the wounded and sick, rushing into the ward twice under enemy strafing to rescue the wounded and sick, and finally collapsing due to physical exhaustion; Wang Lianhui, an eighteen-year-old Youth League member who rescued more than thirty wounded soldiers from a vehicle under strafing by two enemy planes; Guo Fengqi, a nineteen-year-old Youth League member who climbed on top of wounded soldiers to protect them during enemy bombing; and Han Fengsheng, who took the lead in leading all medical personnel, rescuing more than forty boxes of medicine under strafing by six enemy planes, and insisted on working the same day after fainting. All of these are outstanding figures in the logistics units of the Volunteer Army. It is precisely because of their high degree of hatred for the enemy and their boundless love for the motherland, the people, and the gloriously wounded soldiers that the above miracles were created.
    I started working during the Second Battle. At that time, I and four nurses and one doctor went to the front to transfer 120 wounded soldiers. The task was very arduous, and everyone worked as if they were ten people. During the day, I was a cook and a caregiver. At night, I had to stand guard and provide care. When surgery was performed, I also assisted the doctor. In five days and nights, I did not get a good rest, and finally managed to send the wounded soldiers to the rear transfer station safely and soundly. During the Third Battle, I was the first to rush into a burning ward filled with thick smoke and flames under the strafing of two enemy planes, rescuing the first seriously wounded soldier and continuing to lead all the nurses to rush into the three burning wards, rescuing fifteen seriously wounded soldiers. During the Fourth Battle, the reception company I was in only had fifteen medical personnel. There were many wounded soldiers and the work was overwhelming. At that time, I thought, "Even though there are many wounded soldiers and few staff members, I must use all my strength to complete the task with my comrades, and I cannot be careless in the slightest." So I redistributed the strength of all the doctors and nurses in the company and a small number of civilian workers. In addition to being responsible for medical leadership work, I also had to organize civilian worker stretcher bearers and administrative matters. Therefore, for half a month, I did not eat a meal on time or get a good night's sleep. When I thought of the suffering of the wounded soldiers, I worked continuously without knowing fatigue, and finally completed the arduous task together with my comrades. During the Fifth Battle, the company I was in was receiving seriously wounded soldiers. One day, Yang Guanghai, a seriously wounded soldier with a serious leg injury and excessive blood loss, was in a very dangerous condition. In order to save my class brother, I gave him 100 cc of blood without hesitation and continued to work without rest. Whenever I encountered difficulties, needed to endure hardship, and exert the greatest effort, I thought of the Party and Chairman Mao, and I thought of the painful life of being beaten and insulted by landlords when I was a cowherd, and the happy days of the liberation of the people throughout the country. Then I had strength. This strength gave me the greatest courage to fight the enemy, allowing me to disregard my own life to rescue my class brothers, allowing me to work tirelessly, and allowing us to advance victoriously forever.

    为了我们最可爱的人
    人民志愿军模范医务工作者  田茂祥
    中国人民志愿军的医务、卫生工作者，像前线的战斗英雄们一样，具有高度政治觉悟和革命人道主义精神，他们全心全意为伤病员服务，在必要的时候，他们会毫不迟疑地牺牲自己，保存伤病员同志们的生命。
    在第四次战役的时候，我前沿某兵站医院的医生宋冠群，曾经在四架飞机扫射、轰炸的危险情况下，和护士陈书智连续四次冲进浓烟烈火的病房，抢救出八名重伤员，当他准备去抢救第九个、第十个的时候，他和陈书智二人都负了伤，敌机打断了他的右臂。但这时他所想的，不是他自己，而是伤病员的安全。死后被追认为模范共产党员的十九岁女护士赵玉花，是体现着革命人道主义精神的最好典型。朝鲜前线的生活异常艰苦，在医院里有粮食、菜蔬，要首先让给伤病员吃；由于敌机的骚扰，就要不分昼夜的工作。赵玉花因为工作过忙，曾四昼夜没有睡眠，没有按时吃过一顿热饭。为了挽救一个失血过多的战士的生命，她毫不迟疑地给他输血二百西西。领导上让她休息，但她说：“工作这样忙，我是休息不下去的。”就在第二天早晨，为了护理伤病员，两架敌机夺去了她年轻的生命。一个赵玉花倒下了，却有更多的赵玉花站了起来。不久后，在同一个收容连里，就又产生了同样坚持数昼夜不睡眠，为伤病员输血一百五十西西，在敌机扫射下两次冲进病房，抢救伤病员，最后以体力不支以致昏倒的女护士胡文兴；在两架敌机扫射下从汽车上抢救出三十余名伤员的十八岁青年团员王连会；在敌机轰炸时爬在伤员身上掩护伤员的十九岁青年团员郭凤岐；以身作则带领全体医护人员，在六架敌机扫射下，抢出四十多箱药品，昏倒后当天仍坚持工作的韩凤声等。所有这些，都是志愿军后勤部队出色的优秀人物。正因为他们对敌人高度仇恨，对祖国、对人民、对光荣负伤的战士们的无比热爱，才产生了如上的奇迹。
    我是在第二次战役开始工作的。当时我和四个护士、一个医生到前方转运一百二十名伤员，任务非常艰苦，大家都一以当十的工作。白天我做炊事员、护理员，晚上我还要放哨护理，作手术时，我也做医生的助手。五昼夜中，我没有很好的休息，终于使伤员平安无恙地送到后面转运站。第三次战役的时候，我曾经在两架敌机扫射下第一个冲进了冒着浓烟烈火的病房，抢出了第一个重伤员并继续带动全体护士冲进着火的三个病房，抢救出十五名重伤员。第四次战役时，我在的那个收容连只有十五个医务人员，伤员多，工作忙不过来。当时我这样想：“尽管是伤员多工作人员少，我一定要拿全部力量来和同志们一起完成任务，不能丝毫马虎。”于是我就重新分配了全连医生护士力量和少数民工，我除负责医疗领导工作外，还要组织民工担架以及行政上的事情，所以半月没有按时吃过一顿饭和很好的睡一夜觉，一想起伤员们的痛苦，就不知疲劳的连续工作，终于与同志们共同完成了艰巨的任务。第五次战役，我在的那个连队是收容重伤员，有一天一个腿部重伤流血过多的伤员杨光海，伤势非常危险，为了挽救我的阶级兄弟，我毫无迟疑给他输血一百西西，没有休息，继续工作着。每当我遇到困难，需要我忍受艰苦，付出最大力量的时候，我就想起了党和毛主席，想起了我放牛时受地主的打骂侮辱的痛苦生活和今日全国人民的翻身幸福的日子，我就有了力量。这种力量给我最大的勇气去与敌人搏斗，使我丝毫不顾及自己的生命去抢救自己的阶级弟兄，使我能不知疲倦地工作，使我们永远胜利前进。（附图片）
