Stalin's Writings on Linguistics and Its Significance for the Development of Social Sciences
Soviet Doctor of Philosophy Youjin

    Lenin pointed out that no social formation exists in isolation. Within each formation, there are remnants of the old, dying forms and embryos of new, future forms. The class struggle within each social system involves representatives of dying classes who are still struggling and fighting against the victorious system, as well as representatives of the new, growing economic system and newly emerging classes.

    Because each historical era has various different and opposing classes engaged in struggle with each other, the ideas, viewpoints, and institutions produced in each era are far more numerous than the ruling class needs for its own interests. In the realm of ideology, two types of thought—the dying thoughts protecting the old foundation and the new thoughts protecting the newborn foundation—unleash a cruel, class-based struggle. Remnants of feudalism existed for a long time within the bourgeois economic system. Along with the ideas of the ruling bourgeoisie, the ideas of the working class—Marxism—also arose, consolidated, and developed.

    With the change of the economic base, the entire enormous superstructure erected on that base must also be eliminated and changed. This means that the political systems and laws that uphold, protect, and serve the dying base will perish, and their theories, ideas, philosophical viewpoints, and artistic viewpoints will be replaced. However, everything advanced and new that arises within the old society will not die but will gain new and stronger power.

    Therefore, the role of literature and art in social life can also be understood. Literature and art themselves express society's most complete artistic and aesthetic viewpoints, and because they reflect the interests of various social classes, they have class character. They are included in the superstructure because literature and art, like social science, cannot but actively participate in the struggle of various social classes. The literature and art of each era reflect all the deep contradictions of the economic system, and they themselves develop through struggle and contradiction. To exclude literature and art from the superstructure is to deny their class character in class society, to deny their active struggle to strengthen or eliminate a particular base. But this has nothing to do with Marxism. In 1929, during a period of fierce class struggle in our country, Stalin opposed the use of concepts and terms related to inner-Party life (such as "leftists," "rightists," etc. – translator's note) in artistic literature. He wrote: "The most correct thing is to apply concepts belonging to the class category in the field of literature and art, and even to use concepts such as 'Soviet,' 'anti-Soviet,' 'revolutionary,' 'counter-revolutionary,' and so on." (《Letter to Bill-Belotserkovsky》, see *People's Daily*, June 4, 1950, fifth edition). Obviously, Soviet revolutionary literature actively helped to establish and consolidate the socialist foundation, while anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary literature struggled to preserve capitalist relations in our country.

    However, it would be a great mistake to attribute art and literature to the superstructure and therefore believe that the precious and great things created in past historical eras will die, because the superstructure produced by the economic base perishes and is replaced along with the base.

    Pushkin's creation was undoubtedly produced by the aristocratic era of Russian social development. But Pushkin's genius was higher than his own era, higher than the greedy interests of the ruling class. He saw such ugly aspects of the serf system and autocracy that he could not but stand up against this despicable thing. He saw the difficulties and poverty of peasant life and its suffering. He sympathized with the French Revolution and with the progressive anti-serfdom ideas in Russian society, but the conditions of Russia's development at that time did not enable Pushkin to reach the idea of fundamentally changing the social system. Pushkin then began to sing the praises of the ideals of human life that were more sublime than those around him. He embodied these ideals in perfect artistic form, so that his creation became a great achievement of the Russian people in the history of Russian culture. Pushkin's creation went through the era of feudalism and capitalism. His angry attacks on injustice, oppression, and barbarism were like ringing alarm bells, calling on people to fight against the inhuman injustice and oppression of landlords and capitalists. Therefore, it is natural that Pushkin's creation gained its true prosperity in the socialist era.

    Does all this mean that Pushkin's artistic creation is not class-based or is supra-class? Absolutely not. Belinsky analyzed this seeming contradiction very well. Regarding Pushkin, he wrote: "There will come a day when he will become a model Russian poet, and not only aesthetic feelings, but also moral feelings will be formed and developed according to his creation." (*Complete Works of Belinsky*, Russian edition, 1948, Volume 3, page 640). But at the same time, Belinsky saw with genius the historical limitations of Pushkin's creative content. Belinsky wrote about the poem *Eugene Onegin*: "Pushkin described a stage in the formation and development of Russian society with the characters of Onegin, Lensky, and Tatyana, and how truly, accurately, completely, and artistically he described it... The personality so fully and brilliantly reflected by the poet in this poem is everywhere so beautiful, so humanistic... You can see everywhere here a person whose soul and flesh belong entirely to the basic principles that constitute the essence of the class he describes; in short, you can see everywhere here a Russian landlord... He attacks everything that contradicts humanism in this class; but the principles of the class are for him—eternal truth..." (*Selected Works of Belinsky's Philosophy*, Russian edition, 1941, page 265)

    Pushkin's creation has a very deep connection with the creation of the people, with the aesthetic and artistic images created by the Russian people over many centuries. Pushkin geniusly reflected the creativity of the people. Therefore, he also transcended the greedy interests of the landlords, so the Tsar and his servants hated Pushkin and persecuted and killed him. But under these conditions, to separate Pushkin's creation from the social environment and historical conditions in which he lived and created would be anti-historicism.

    There have been many examples in history of artists breaking away from their class ties and turning to the ideological and political positions of another class, fighting to overthrow the class to which they formerly belonged.

    Therefore, it is natural for the ruling class to abandon his creation, not put it in the arsenal of its superstructure, and oppose it. There have often been such phenomena in history. Lenin wrote about Tolstoy: "By origin and education, Tolstoy belonged to the high-ranking landlords of Russia—but he broke away from all the habits and viewpoints of this class, and in his later works, he passionately criticized all the state, church, social, and economic systems that were based on enslaving the masses, on the poverty of the masses, and on the bankruptcy of peasants and small farmers in general..." (*Complete Works of Lenin*, Russian edition, fourth edition, Volume 16, page 301). In practical life, there is also the phenomenon that if an artist is a realist and a great artist, then he has to violate his own class sympathies and political beliefs and rise up against his own class. Engels wrote about Balzac: "His great work is a deep and continuous elegy for the incurable corruption and decline of high society, because he sympathizes with the class that has been declared dead... I think one of the greatest victories of realism, one of the most valuable qualities of old Balzac, is that he had to violate his own class sympathies and political prejudices..." (*Complete Works of Marx and Engels*, Russian edition, Volume 28, pages 28-29)

    The same is true for other social viewpoints and theories. Philosophy, political economy, and history all reflect the interests of various social classes. But with the death of the old foundation and the old superstructure, everything that was progressive in the old society is preserved. For example, everyone knows that the rational kernel of classical bourgeois political economy, Hegelian philosophy, and French utopian socialism became the source of Marxism's emergence.

    Some comrades, excluding literature, art, and even philosophy from the superstructure, on the pretext that this seems to lead to the negation of all the valuable things in the old heritage, make a mistake because they treat the problem with a pedantic attitude and cannot understand the characteristics of the development of the ideological superstructure well. Engels explained long ago that the ideological superstructure is not completely created anew by the new economy and the new base, because neither literature, art, nor philosophy can occur on bare ground. They are produced on the basis of the ideological materials and concepts that have already been achieved within the scope of the old society. The new economic base that replaces the old base only stipulates the new direction of ideological development that is suitable for the interests and needs of this base.

    Engels said: "The economy—does not recreate anything here, but it stipulates the style of change and further development of existing ideological materials, but even this is mostly carried out indirectly, because the reflections of politics, law, and morality give philosophy a direct and extremely important influence." (*Collected Letters of Marx and Engels*, Russian edition, 1932, page 3845)

    Obviously, this can also be used to explain literature and art. It is also very obvious that the new and advanced class that rises up to replace the reactionary old class continues and develops the most valuable things in the old heritage. The proletariat is the most advanced and revolutionary class, and it is the natural heir to all the excellent achievements created by the world's culture to date.

    In his work *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics*, Comrade Stalin brilliantly explained the regularity of the demise of the old foundation and the old superstructure and the establishment of the new foundation and the new superstructure corresponding to it. The special persuasiveness of Comrade Stalin's principles lies in the fact that he demonstrated these laws with the experience of the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin says: "In the last thirty years, the old capitalist foundation has been eliminated in Russia, and a new socialistic foundation has been built. At the same time, the superstructure on the capitalist foundation has also been eliminated, and a new superstructure suitable for the socialistic foundation has been built. That is to say, the old political and legal systems have been replaced by new socialist systems." (Stalin: *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics*, Liberation Press edition, page 2)

    Lenin said that the replacement of the old foundation and the old superstructure is realized in the process of social revolution. Stalin developed and concretized Lenin's thought. Lenin wrote: "The high evaluation of revolutionary periods in human development comes from the entire sum of Marx's historical viewpoint... It is precisely in these periods that the direct role of various classes in the stipulation of social life forms is most powerfully manifested, that the foundation of the political 'superstructure' is established, and the superstructure is then maintained for a long time on the basis of the newly born relations of production." (Lenin: *On Marx, Engels, and Marxism*, Russian edition, 1940, page 194)

    With the completion of the socialist foundation, a new socialist economic base and the corresponding socialist superstructure were established in the Soviet Union. The social ownership of the means of production—the ownership of the whole people and cooperative ownership—represented by two friendly classes, the working class and the collective farmers, constitutes the foundation of the socialist economic base of the Soviet Union. The Soviet socialist state led by the Communist Party, as the Marxist-Leninism, socialist morality, Soviet art, literature, and other viewpoints and systems of Soviet society that occupy the dominant position in the Soviet Union, constitutes the socialist superstructure.

    The socialist superstructure is fundamentally different from all past superstructures. It no longer serves the interests of the exploiters but serves the interests of the laborers and the interests of the whole society.

    The Soviet socialist superstructure is a great revolutionary creative force. It gives the Soviet economic base a great influence, and through it, it has a great influence on the development of productive forces. At no time in history have the state and advanced ideas had such power as the Soviet state and the Communist Party have in the Soviet Union. The Communist Party is the guiding and leading force in the entire system of the socialist state. It is also the great organizing and mobilizing force of the entire Soviet people. The policy of the Communist Party is the foundation of the life of Soviet society. In the socialist era, due to the elimination of exploiting classes and antagonistic contradictions, and due to the planned nature of the economy, the interrelationship between the superstructure and the base has undergone new changes, thereby particularly expanding the power of the superstructure's counter-influence on the base, and through the base, the counter-influence on the productive forces. The great power of the socialist superstructure gives the speed of socialist construction a decisive influence; the role of the superstructure will be further increased in the continuous victorious construction of communist society.

    The socialist state led by Lenin and Stalin's party is the main tool for building communism. It is realizing the functions of economic organization and cultural education on an increasingly large scale.

    Comrade Stalin's principles on the base and the superstructure armed our party and our cadres with new and powerful ideological weapons, helping them to grasp the laws of social development more deeply and to guarantee the laws of communist victory. This theory also armed the Communist Parties of various capitalist countries, pointing out to them how they should guide their struggle in order to eliminate and smash the bourgeois superstructure, first of all, to eliminate the bourgeois state—the main obstacle on the road to the victory of the working class and the establishment of the working class's regime.

    Comrade Stalin's work *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics* raised many new questions about the regularity that has occurred and developed in socialist society. Comrade Stalin gave a classic explanation of the various laws of dialectics in his work *Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism*. These laws have universal properties, and they are applicable to all phenomena in the outside world—nature, society, and thinking. The laws of dialectics are expressed differently according to the form of material movement. They are always expressed as concrete laws. In the history of class society, the transition from quantitative change to qualitative change, from old quality to new quality, is always realized through sudden change, through social revolution. The great October Socialist Revolution was the greatest sudden change and the greatest revolution in our history.

    After the victory of the socialist revolution, our country went through the transition period from capitalism to socialism, built a socialist society, and now we are in the stage of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism.

    Throughout the entire period of socialist construction, Comrade Stalin theoretically summarized the experience of socialist construction step by step, discovered and formulated the laws of the transition period, that is, the laws of the socialist era. In his great activities of leading socialist construction and summarizing the experience of the Party and the people, Comrade Stalin created a comprehensive and perfect theory of socialist construction and a complete theory of the socialist state, and studied the question of building communism in the Soviet Union and the path of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. Marxist science has been fully developed in Comrade Stalin's works. The stipulation of how the laws of dialectics are expressed under the conditions of socialist society is a new and great discovery in Marxist theory. Socialism is a new form of social life development, so the laws of dialectics are also expressed in new ways, which are different from societies where antagonistic classes exist. Comrade Stalin wrote: "Generally speaking, to tell those comrades who are obsessed with the theory of sudden change, the law of transition from old quality to new quality through sudden change not only does not apply to the history of language development, but also does not often apply to other social phenomena belonging to the base or the superstructure. Sudden change is necessary for a society divided into two antagonistic classes, but sudden change is not necessary for a society without antagonistic classes." (Stalin: *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics*, Liberation Press edition, page 30) Comrade Stalin demonstrated this principle with a typical example from the history of the transformation of the Soviet peasant economy. He said: "We realized the transition of our agriculture from the system of bourgeois individual farmers to the socialist collective farm system in eight to ten years. This was a revolution that eliminated the old bourgeois economic system in the countryside and established a new socialist system, but the realization of this reform was not achieved through sudden change, that is, not through overthrowing the existing regime and establishing a new regime, but through the gradual transition from the old bourgeois system in the countryside to the new system. This was successful because it was a revolution from above, and this change was initiated by the existing regime and was supported by the basic masses of peasants." (Ibid., page 30)

    From this principle of Stalin, we can draw a conclusion that under the conditions of socialist society, development is also realized according to the laws of dialectics, that is, socialism will also produce new qualitative phenomena of social life in its further development. The transition from one qualitative state to another will be revolutionary in nature in terms of its magnitude. The transition to communism will be a great leap in the development of our society's productive forces. The transition from the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to the communist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" will be a great qualitative change in Soviet social life. Communism, in its further development, will bring the development of science and technology to an unprecedented peak, and will bring the development of productive forces to a new and higher level. These great changes in the development of socialist society and communist society will have the same significance as revolutionary leaps in terms of their speed and magnitude, but these changes do not carry and will not carry the nature of social revolution. This progress will be unrelated to the change of social systems and will be realized on the basis of the communist social system without sudden change. These reforms will be consciously and gradually prepared by the state and the Communist Party from above, and they will be consciously and actively realized by the entire people.

    This new dialectical regularity in the development of socialist society discovered by Comrade Stalin is a very great contribution to the theory of scientific communism and to Marxist theory. It is a further development of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. Our glorious Bolshevik Party has been enriched by the new understanding of the laws of socialist development, which will further improve the ideological and scientific level of our cadres and accelerate our advance towards communism.

    Comrade Stalin's solution to the question of the transition from one quality to another in the development of socialist society is an example of creative Marxism, and for scholars engaged in social science, it is an example of how to creatively study new phenomena in our lives, and how to creatively, rather than dogmatically, apply the greatest revolutionary force in science, that is, Marxist-Leninist dialectics.

    ★ ★ ★ ★

    I have only talked about some of the questions raised and solved by Comrade Stalin in his work *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics*. This work also contains many other questions that have great significance for the development of social sciences. The way the question of the relationship between language and thinking is raised and solved belongs to this category. The principle put forward by Comrade Stalin is: "No matter what kind of thought is produced in the human mind, it can only be produced and exist on the basis of language materials, on the basis of the terms and sentences of language. A naked thought without any language materials and without any language 'natural matter' does not exist." (Stalin: *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics*, Liberation Press edition, page 44) This principle on the role of language in the occurrence and development of thinking, that is, in human understanding of the outside world, elucidates the materialist nature of the scientific, that is, Marxist epistemology from a new aspect, and defeats modern idealism, which not only separates thinking from the outside world but also separates thinking from language. That is to say, according to the idealists, thinking is a mysterious "temperament" given to people from above. This extremely important topic is the object of specialized scientific research and should be the subject of a special report.

    In his works, Comrade Stalin developed the Marxist principle of treating various social phenomena with a historical attitude with new force. Comrade Stalin once again demonstrated the harm of dogmatism and pedantry in solving major problems of socialist revolution and socialist construction. For example, Marx and Engels, in the 1840s, when capitalism had not yet become monopoly capitalism and was developing more or less smoothly upwards, concluded that socialist revolution could not be victorious in a single country, and it could only be victorious due to the simultaneous victory in all countries or most civilized countries. In the early 20th century, capitalism had clearly transformed into monopoly capitalism, and it had developed downwards from rising capitalism. The law of uneven development stipulated the different periods of maturity of proletarian revolutions in various countries. At this time, Lenin reached the brilliant conclusion that it is now impossible for the revolution to be victorious simultaneously in all countries, and it is now possible for the revolution to be victorious first in a single country or in several countries. Comrade Stalin pointed out that these two conclusions are suitable for two different eras, and each conclusion is correct for its own era. However, those who memorize books and pedants do not go to the root of the problem, but formally cite these two different formulas. They think that only one of the two is correct, and one is incorrect. However, Comrade Stalin said that both conclusions are correct, but not without conditions. Each conclusion is correct for its own era.

    The same is true for another extremely important question—the question of the state under communism. Engels said in *Anti-Dühring* that the state must wither away after the victory of socialism. Comrade Stalin said that on this basis, those who memorize books and pedants began to demand that our party try to make the Soviet state wither away as soon as possible after the victory of the socialist revolution in the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin brilliantly explained that Engels' formula is not simply outdated, but it refers to the victory of socialism in all countries or in most countries. However, because socialism was victorious first in one country, the Marxists in Russia concluded from the study of today's world situation that in the capitalist encirclement, where the socialist revolution has won in only one country, the victorious socialist country should not only not weaken but should consolidate and fully strengthen its own state, state organs, reconnaissance organs, and army, if this country does not want to be defeated by the capitalist encirclement.

    Comrade Stalin, with these examples of solving fundamental problems of the socialist revolution, once again demonstrated his example of solving various new problems with true dialectics and truly developing Marxist dialectics.

    Our great Marxist-Leninist theory has been enriched by new and brilliant creations. Comrade Stalin's work *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics* confirms his words that Marxism, as a science, cannot stay in one place, and Marxism should be constantly developed and enriched according to new scientific materials and the experience of the workers' movement and the revolutionary experience of the masses.

      ★ ★ ★

    Comrade Stalin's work *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics* is an outstanding event in the ideological life of the Soviet people and the communist movement around the world. This work brilliantly shows the great creativity of Marxism. Marxism is constantly developed and enriched by new experiences and new knowledge.

    Comrade Stalin taught us: "Marxism is the science of the laws of the development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, and the science of the construction of communist society."

    This classic definition of Marxism puts forward new tasks for our scientific workers and workers on the ideological front, obliging them to study new theoretical problems based on the practice of communist construction in the Soviet Union and the summary of the experience of the international communist movement. Comrade Stalin taught us that any science can only develop under the conditions of free criticism and the struggle of different opinions.

    Comrade Stalin's work has opened up broad prospects for the development of Marxist-Leninist science, inspired the Soviet intellectuals and the entire Soviet people to carry out new creative and bold attempts, and inspired them to establish new merits for the victory of communism. This work of Comrade Stalin armed the Communist Parties of the people's democratic countries with the knowledge of the laws of socialist construction, and it armed the Communist Parties of capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries with the understanding of the laws of revolution and the understanding of the laws of class struggle that will finally overthrow the capitalist oppression of the world.

    斯大林关于语言学问题的著作对于社会科学发展的意义
    苏联哲学博士  尤金

    列宁指出过，任何一种社会形态，都不是单纯地存在着的，每一种形态中总有着旧的垂死形态之残余和新的未来形态之胚胎。在每一社会制度的阶级斗争中，都有垂死的但是还在极力挣扎并同胜利了的制度作斗争的阶级之代表参加，在这一斗争中也有新的生长着的经济制度之代表、新产生的阶级之代表参加。
    由于每一历史时代有着彼此进行斗争的各种不同的和对立的阶级，所以每一历史时代所产生的思想、观点和制度远比统治阶级利益所需要的为多。在思想体系方面，两种思想——垂死的保护着旧基础的思想和新的保护着新生基础的思想——展开残酷的阶级性的斗争。在资产阶级经济制度的内部长久地存在着封建制度的残余。与统治的资产阶级的思想并存，工人阶级的思想——马克思主义也产生、巩固和发展起来了。
    随着经济基础的更替，在这个基础上所树立起来的全部庞大的上层建筑也要被消灭和被改变。这意味着那些坚持、保护和服务于垂死基础的政治制度、法律就要死亡，其理论、思想、哲学观点和艺术观点就要被更替。但是，在旧社会内部产生的一切先进的新的事物却不会死亡，而要获得新的更强盛的力量。
    因此，文学和艺术在社会生活中的作用，也是可以理解的。文学和艺术本身表现社会的最充分艺术的与美学的观点，因而为它们反映着各个不同的社会阶级的利益，所以它们是有阶级性的；因而它们也包括在上层建筑之内，因为文学和艺术正如社会科学一样，不能不积极参加各个不同的社会阶级的斗争。每一时代的文学和艺术都反映出该经济制度的全部深刻的矛盾，并且它们本身就是经过斗争、经过矛盾而发展起来的。把文学和艺术排斥在上层建筑之外，这就是说否认它们在阶级社会中的阶级性，这就是说否认它们为增强或者消灭某一基础而积极斗争。但是这却与马克思主义毫不相干。斯大林在一九二九年，即在我国正进行残酷的阶级斗争的时期，曾经反对艺术文学中使用与党内生活有关的概念、术语（如“左派”、“右派”等——译者注），他写道：“最正确的就是要在文艺领域里应用属于阶级一类的概念，甚至于运用‘苏维埃的’、‘反苏维埃的’、‘革命的’、‘反革命的’等等概念。”（《给比尔——别洛采尔科夫斯基的信》，见一九五○年六月四日《人民日报》，第五版）。显然的，苏维埃的革命的文学曾经积极地帮助社会主义基础建立和巩固起来，而反苏维埃的反革命的文学是为在我国保存资本主义关系而进行斗争的。
    但是，将艺术和文学归属于上层建筑，因而认为过去各个历史时代所创造出来的宝贵的和伟大的东西都会死亡，这是很大的错误，因为由经济基础所产生的上层建筑是随着基础一起而灭亡、更替的。
    普式庚的创作，无疑地，是由俄国社会发展的贵族时代所产生的。但是普式庚的天才却高出于自己的时代，高出于统治阶级的贪婪利益，他看到了农奴制度和专制政体的如此丑恶的方面，因而不能不站起来反对这可鄙的东西。他看到了农民生活的艰难和贫困及其痛苦。他同情法国革命，同情俄国社会中进步的反农奴制度的思想，但是当时俄国发展的条件，没有使普式庚达到根本改变社会制度的思想。普式庚于是开始歌颂比他周围更崇高的人类生活的理想。他用完善的艺术形式体现了这些理想，以致他的创作在俄国文化史上成为俄国人民的一个极伟大的成就。普式庚的创作经历了封建主义与资本主义的时代。他对非正义、压迫和野蛮的愤怒的攻击，像是敲响了警钟，号召人们去同地主的与资本主义的对人的非正义的压迫进行斗争。因此，普式庚的创作在社会主义时代获得了自己真正的繁荣，这是很自然的。
    所有这一切是否意味着，普式庚的艺术创作就不是阶级性的或者是超阶级的呢？绝不是的。柏林斯基就曾很好地分析过这种假象的矛盾。关于普式庚，他曾写道：“将有一天，他会成为俄国典范的诗人，不仅美学的感情，而且道德的感情都将依着他的创作而形成和发展起来。”（《柏林斯基全集》，俄文一九四八年版，第三卷，第六四○页）。但柏林斯基同时并天才地看见了普式庚创作内容的历史限制性。柏林斯基关于《欧根·奥涅金》这篇长诗写道：“普式庚以奥涅金、连斯基和妲姬雅娜的人物描写了俄国社会形成和发展中的一个阶段，并且他多么真实，多么确切，多么完全而艺术地描写了它啊……诗人如此充分地和光辉地在这篇长诗中反映出来的个性，处处都是这样优美的，这样人道主义的……你可以在这里处处看到这样一种人，他的灵魂血肉全属于构成他所描写的那一阶级的实质的基本原则；简单地说，就是你可以在这里处处看到俄国地主……他就在这个阶级里攻击着与人道主义相矛盾的一切；但是阶级的原则对于他——乃是永恒的真理……。”（《柏林斯基哲学选集》，俄文一九四一年版，第二六五页）
    普式庚的创作是与人民的创作，是与俄国人民许多世纪间所创造出来的美学的艺术形象有着极深刻的联系。普式庚天才地反映了人民的创造。因此，他也就超越了地主的贪婪利益，因此沙皇及其臣仆们都仇恨普式庚，并迫害和杀死他。但是在这种种条件下，想把普式庚的创作从他所生活与创作的那个社会环境和历史条件割离开来，那就是反历史主义的。
    历史上有过许多例子，其艺术家摆脱了与本阶级的联系，而转到另一阶级的思想、政治立场上，为了推翻他从前所属那一阶级而进行斗争。
    所以，统治阶级抛弃他的创作，不把它放在自己上层建筑的武库里面，并且反对它，这是很自然的。在历史上常常有过这类的现象。列宁关于托尔斯泰，这样写道：“按出身和教养来说，托尔斯泰是属于俄国高等的地主贵族的，——但他摆脱了这一阶层的一切习惯和观点，并在其晚年的著作里，以热情的批评打击了当时一切以奴役群众，以群众的贫困和以农民和一般小农的破产为依据的国家、教会、社会和经济制度……。”（《列宁全集》，俄文第四版，第一六卷，第三○一页）在实际生活当中，也有着这样的现象，即艺术家如果他是现实主义者和伟大的艺术家，那么他就不得不违反自己的阶级同情心和政治信仰，而起来反对自己的阶级。恩格斯关于巴尔扎克写道：“他的伟大的作品，乃是为高等社会不可救药的腐化堕落而作的深长不绝的挽歌，因为他是同情那一被宣告死亡的阶级的……我认为现实主义的最伟大胜利之一，老巴尔扎克最宝贵的特质之一，就是他不得不去违反自己的阶级同情心和政治偏见……。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》，俄文版，第二八卷，第二八——二九页）
    至于其它社会观点和理论，也都是一样。哲学、政治经济学和历史学都反映社会各阶级的利益。但是随着旧基础和旧上层建筑的死亡，一切在旧社会中是进步的东西却保存下来。例如，大家知道，资产阶级古典政治经济学、黑格尔哲学和法国乌托邦社会主义的合理内核，成了马克思主义发生的来源。
    有些同志，把文学、艺术，甚至哲学都排斥在上层建筑以外，借口这似乎要走到对旧遗产中的一切宝贵的东西的否定，他们的错误，就在于他们以书呆子的态度来对待问题，不能很好地了解意识形态的上层建筑发展之特质。恩格斯早就解释过，意识形态的上层建筑不是由新的经济、新的基础完全从新创造出来的，因为不论是文学、艺术或是哲学等等，都不能够在光秃的地面上发生的。它们是在旧社会范围内所已达成的思想材料和观念的基础上产生出来的。起而代替旧基础之新的经济基础，只是规定适合于这一基础的利益与需要之意识形态的新的发展方向。
    恩格斯说：“经济——在这里没有重新创作出什么，但是它规定现存思想材料改变与进一步发展的样式，可是甚至就是这一点，它绝大部分也是间接地实行的，因为政治、法律、道德的反映，给予哲学以直接的极重要的影响。”（《马克思恩格斯书信集》，俄文一九三二年版，第三八四五页）
    显然，这也完全可以用来说明文学和艺术。起来代替反动旧阶级的新的先进阶级仍然继续着和发展着旧遗产中最宝贵的东西，这也是很显然的。无产阶级乃是最先进最革命的阶级，它是迄今世界文化所创造出来的一切优良成就的当然继承者。
    斯大林同志在《马克思主义与语言学问题》著作中，天才地阐明了旧基础和旧上层建筑灭亡、及新基础和与之相适应的新上层建筑创立的规律性。斯大林同志这些原理的特殊说服性就在于他以苏联的经验论证了这些规律。斯大林同志说：“在最近三十年中，在俄国消灭了旧的资本主义基础，建设了新的社会主义基础。同时，也就消灭了资本主义基础上的上层建筑，并建设了适合于社会主义基础的新的上层建筑。这就是说，旧的政治、法律等制度已经被新的社会主义制度所代替了。”（斯大林：《马克思主义与语言学问题》，解放社版，第二页）
    列宁说旧基础和旧上层建筑的更替是在社会革命过程中实现的，斯大林发展列宁的这一思想并使之具体化了。列宁写道：“对于人类发展中革命时期的高度估价，是从马克思历史观点全部总和而来的……正是在这些时期才最有力地表现出各阶级在社会生活形式之规定中的直接作用，才建立起政治‘上层建筑’的基础，上层建筑然后在新生的生产关系之基础上长久地保持起来。”（列宁：《论马克思恩格斯及马克思主义》，俄文一九四○年版，第一九四页）
    随着社会主义基础的建成，在苏联建立了新的社会主义经济基础及与之相适应的社会主义上层建筑。由两个彼此友好的阶级——工人阶级和集体农民所代表着的生产资料之全社会所有制——全民的和合作社的所有制，构成苏联社会主义经济基础的基础。而共产党所领导的苏维埃社会主义国家，作为在苏联占统治地位的世界观的马克思列宁主义、社会主义的道德、苏维埃的艺术、文学、以及苏维埃社会的其它观点与制度等等，则构成社会主义的上层建筑。
    社会主义的上层建筑是与一切过去的上层建筑原则上不同的。它已不是替剥削者的利益服务，而是替劳动者的利益、全社会的利益服务的。
    苏维埃社会主义的上层建筑，乃是一种极伟大的革命的创造力量。它给予苏维埃经济基础以巨大的影响，并通过它对生产力的发展有巨大的影响。在历史上任何时候，国家和先进思想从没有像苏维埃国家和共产党在苏联所有的这样的力量。共产党是社会主义国家整个体系中的指导的和领导的力量。它也是全体苏联人民的伟大的组织的与动员的力量。共产党的政策是苏维埃社会的生命基础。在社会主义时代，由于剥削阶级和对抗性矛盾的消灭，以及由于经济的计划性，上层建筑和基础的相互关系有了新的改变，从而特别地扩大了上层建筑对于基础的反影响的力量，并通过基础对于生产力的反影响的力量。社会主义上层建筑的极伟大的力量，给予社会主义建设速度以决定性的影响；上层建筑的作用，在共产主义社会建设不断胜利的过程中将要更加增大起来。
    列宁、斯大林党所领导的社会主义国家，乃是建成共产主义的主要工具。它正在规模日益宏大地实现经济组织的和文化教育的职能。
    斯大林同志的关于基础与上层建筑的原理，用新的强大的思想武器武装了我们的党和我们的干部，帮助他们更深刻地去掌握社会发展的规律，保证共产主义胜利的规律。这一学说也武装了各资本主义国家的共产党，向它们指明：它们为了消灭和粉碎资产阶级的上层建筑，首先是消灭资产阶级的国家——争取工人阶级胜利、建立工人阶级政权的道路上的主要障碍，就应当如何指导自己的斗争。
    斯大林同志的著作《马克思主义与语言学问题》，从新提出了许多关于社会主义社会中业已发生和发展的规律性的问题。斯大林同志在《辩证唯物论与历史唯物论》著作中，给辩证法的各个规律作了经典式的说明。这些规律带有普遍的性质，它们对于外界的一切现象——自然、社会和思惟，都是适用的。辩证法的规律依着物质运动的形式而各个不同地表现出来。它们总是表现为具体的规律。在阶级社会历史中，量变之进到质变，旧质之进到新质，总是经过突变，经过社会革命来实现的。伟大的十月社会主义革命就是我国历史上的这种最伟大的突变、最伟大的革命。
    社会主义革命胜利以后，我国经过了由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，建成了社会主义社会，现在我们正处在由社会主义到共产主义的逐渐过渡时期。
    斯大林同志在整个社会主义建设时期，一步一步地从理论上总结了社会主义建设的经验，发现和制定了过渡时期的规律，即社会主义时代的规律。斯大林同志在其领导社会主义建设和总结党与人民的经验的巨大活动中，创立了全面的完善的社会主义建设理论和完备的社会主义国家理论，研究了关于在苏联可以建成共产主义以及关于由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的道路的问题。马克思主义的科学在斯大林同志的著作中得到了全面的发展。辩证法的规律在社会主义社会条件下如何表现的规定，乃是马克思主义理论中的一个新的和极伟大的发现。社会主义是社会生活发展的一个新的形态，因之辩证法的规律也就用新的方式表现出来，而不同于有敌对阶级存在的社会。斯大林同志写道：“一般说来，要告诉那些醉心于突变论的同志们，从旧质过渡到新质经过突变的法则，不仅不适用于语言发展的历史，而且也不常常适用于属于基础之类的或上层建筑之类的其他社会现象。对于分成两个敌对阶级的社会来说，突变是必须的，但是对于没有敌对阶级的社会，突变就不是必须的了。”（斯大林：《马克思主义与语言学问题》，解放社版，第三○页）斯大林同志用苏联农民经济改造史中的典型例子来论证了这一原理，他说：“我们曾在八年到十年的时间中实现了我国农业从资产阶级个体农民的制度过渡到社会主义的、集体农庄的制度，这是一次消灭在乡村中旧的资产阶级经济制度和建立新的社会主义制度的革命，可是这个改革的实现，不是经过突变，就是说，不是经过推翻现存的政权和建立新的政权来实现的，而是经过从乡村中旧的资产阶级制度到新的制度的逐渐过渡来实现的。这件事所以能够成功，是因为这是从上而下的革命，这次变革是由现存政权主动进行，并获得农民基本群众的拥护而实现的。”（同书，第三○页）
    从斯大林这一原理中可以得出一个结论，即在社会主义社会的条件下，发展也是按照辩证法规律来实现的，即社会主义在进一步的发展中也将产生社会生活的新质的现象。由一个质态过渡到另一个质态，就其规模的巨大来说，将带有革命改造的性质。向共产主义的过渡，将是我们社会生产力发展中的一个极大的飞跃。由社会主义的“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的原则过渡到共产主义的“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则，将是苏维埃社会生活中的一个巨大的质变。共产主义在其进一步的发展中，将使科学、技术的发展达到空前未有的高峰，将使生产力的发展达到一个新的更高度的水平。社会主义社会与共产主义社会发展中的这些巨大变革，按其速度和按其规模来说，将与革命的飞跃式的改革具有同等的意义，但是这些变革，并不带有而且将来也不会带有社会革命的性质，这种进步将与社会制度的更替无关，而将在共产主义社会制度的基础上不经过突变来实现的。这些改革将自觉地和逐渐地由国家、共产党自上面准备起来，它们并将由全体人民自觉地与积极地实现起来。
    斯大林同志所发现的社会主义社会发展中的这个新的辩证法的规律性，乃是对于科学共产主义理论、对于马克思主义理论的一个非常伟大的贡献，这是马克思列宁主义哲学的进一步发展。我们光荣的布尔什维克党因对于社会主义发展的规律有了新的理解而丰富起来，这将更加提高我们干部的思想、科学的水平，和加速我们向共产主义的前进。
    斯大林同志对于社会主义社会发展中由一个质过渡到另一个质的问题之解决，乃是创造性的马克思主义的一个范例，而对于从事社会科学的学者来说，则是应如何创造地研究我们生活中的新现象，应如何创造性地而不是教条主义地在科学中应用最伟大的革命力量即马克思列宁主义辩证法的榜样。

    我在这里只是讲了讲斯大林同志在《马克思主义与语言学问题》著作中所提出的和解决了的若干问题。这部著作还包含有许多其它对于社会科学的发展有重大意义的问题。关于语言与思惟关系问题的提法和解决，就属于这类问题。斯大林同志所提出的原理是：“不论人的头脑中会产生什么样的思想，它只有在语言材料的基础上，在语言的术语和词句的基础上才能产生和存在。完全没有语言的材料和完全没有语言的‘自然物质’的赤裸裸的思想，是不存在的。”（斯大林：《马克思主义与语言学问题》，解放社版，第四四页）这个关于语言在思惟的发生与发展中即人对于外界认识中的作用的原理，从新的方面阐明了科学的即马克思主义的认识论之唯物论的性质，而击败了现代唯心论，现代唯心论不仅使思惟脱离外界，而且使思惟脱离语言，也就是说，照唯心论者的意见，思惟乃是一种从上面赋予人的神秘的“气质”。这个极为重要的论题，是专门科学研究的对象，应作专题报告。
    斯大林同志在其著作中用新的力量发展了马克思主义关于以历史的态度来对待各种社会现象的原理。斯大林同志再度表明了教条主义和书呆子对于解决社会主义革命和社会主义建设重大问题的危害。例如，马克思和恩格斯在十九世纪四十年代，即当资本主义尚未成为垄断资本主义和多少平稳地向上发展的时候，曾得出结论说，社会主义革命不可能在单独某一国内取得胜利，它只有由于一切国家或大多数文明国家中的同时胜利而才能取得胜利。到二十世纪初期，资本主义已经明显地转变成为垄断资本主义，它已由上升的资本主义向下发展，而不平衡发展的法则则规定了各国无产阶级革命成熟时期的不同，这时列宁得出天才的结论说：现在革命在一切国家内的同时胜利是不可能的了，而现在革命首先在单独一个国家或者在若干国家内取得胜利则成为可能的了。斯大林同志指出：这两种结论适合于两种不同的时代，其中每一个结论对于自己的时代都是对的。而死啃书本的人和书呆子却不去根究问题的本质，而是形式地引证这两种不同的公式，他们认为二者当中只有一个是对的，一个是不对的。但是，斯大林同志说，这两个结论都是对的，可是不是没有条件的，每一结论对于自己的时代都是正确的。
    对于另一个极重要的问题——共产主义条件下的国家问题，也是一样的道理。恩格斯在《反杜林论》一书中说过，在社会主义胜利以后，国家一定要衰亡。斯大林同志说道，死啃书本的人和书呆子根据这种理由，当社会主义革命在苏联胜利以后，便开始要求我们的党设法使苏维埃国家尽快地衰亡。斯大林同志天才地说明：恩格斯的公式并不是简单地过时了，而它是就社会主义在一切国家或在大多数国家内的胜利说的。但是，由于社会主义首先在一国内胜利，所以俄国的马克思主义者便从对于今天世界形势的研究出发，得出结论说：在资本主义包围之下、社会主义革命仅在一国内获得胜利，这时候胜利了的社会主义国家不仅不应当削弱，反而应当巩固和全力加强自己的国家、国家机关、侦察机关和军队，如果这个国家不愿意被资本主义包围所击溃的话。
    斯大林同志用这些解决社会主义革命根本问题的例子，再一次地表明了他以真正的辩证法解决各种新问题及真正发展马克思主义辩证法的典范。
    我们伟大的马克思列宁主义理论因新的天才的创造而丰富了起来。斯大林同志的《马克思主义与语言学问题》这部著作证实了他的一句话，他说过：马克思主义作为科学不能够停留在一个地方，马克思主义应当根据科学的新材料和工人运动的经验、人民群众的革命经验而不断发展和丰富起来。

    斯大林同志的著作《马克思主义与语言学问题》，是苏联人民和全世界共产主义运动思想生活中的一个突出事件。这一著作光辉地显示了马克思主义之伟大创造力。马克思主义不断地由新的经验、新的知识发展和丰富起来。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“马克思主义乃是关于自然与社会发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学。”
    这个对马克思主义的经典式的定义，向我们的科学工作的干部、向思想战线上的工作者提出了新的任务，责成他们要根据苏联共产主义建设实践和国际共产主义运动经验的总结，来研究新的理论问题。斯大林同志教导我们说，任何科学只有在自由批评和不同意见的斗争的条件下才能发展起来。
    斯大林同志的这部著作给马克思列宁主义科学的发展开辟了广阔的前途，鼓舞了苏联的知识分子、全体苏联人民去实行新的创造性的大胆尝试，鼓舞了他们去为共产主义胜利而树立新的功绩。斯大林同志的这一著作，以社会主义建设规律的知识武装了各人民民主国家的共产党，它并以对于革命规律的理解，以对于最后推翻全世界资本主义压迫的阶级斗争规律的理解，武装了资本主义国家、殖民地及附属国家的共产党。（秋江、列兵译）
