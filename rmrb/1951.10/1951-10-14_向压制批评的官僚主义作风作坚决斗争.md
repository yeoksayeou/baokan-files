    Resolutely Struggle Against the Bureaucratic Work Style of Suppressing Criticism

    To develop criticism and self-criticism in newspapers is a "serious step to raise the awareness and enthusiasm of the people and attract the people to enthusiastically participate in the cause of national construction." (Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China "Regarding the Development of Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications"). However, some party members and cadres, even some leading cadres and party organizations, still do not have a clear understanding of this, and therefore do not "adopt a revolutionary attitude of welcoming and protecting" critics, but instead adopt a rude attitude of attacking and suppressing them. The incident of Chang Ganchen and other party members and cadres in the First District of Mianyang County, Hubei Province, suppressing criticism and attacking critics is a typical example.

    The "Reader's Letters" column of the Hubei Daily on June 11 published a letter criticizing a district committee of the First District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Mianyang County for not paying attention to the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. However, party members and cadres Chang Ganchen, Qi Guobiao, and others believed that the writer—Hu Keqing, a party member and cadre of the Mianyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China—was deliberately picking "faults," and scolded Hu Keqing as a "spy," "sabotaging the work of the First District," and wanted to send Hu to the Public Security Bureau for legal action, and even hit Hu Keqing twice. Qi Guobiao picked up a bench to hit Hu Keqing, saying that if he killed Hu, he was "willing to go to jail," but was stopped. Xu Zirong, the propaganda minister of the county party committee, and Xia Fuqing, the secretary of the First District Committee, turned a blind eye to this serious incident of suppressing criticism, and only lightly criticized Chang Ganchen and others, and instead asked Hu Keqing to examine his attitude towards writing the manuscript. This is a completely unprincipled approach.

    Hubei Daily carried out a series of ideological struggles against this bureaucratic tendency of suppressing criticism. After receiving Hu Keqing's appeal, the newspaper forwarded it to the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Hubei Provincial Committee immediately instructed the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Mianyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China to deal with this matter quickly. However, the Mianyang County Committee adopted a bureaucratic attitude, delaying the issue for a month, and instead made an erroneous decision to suppress the critic through organizational means: suggesting that the Hongshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China punish Hu Keqing (Hu had been transferred to Hongshan County at this time). In order to uphold the principles of criticism and self-criticism of the Party, Hubei Daily refused to publish the above-mentioned erroneous decision and launched a discussion on this issue among readers in the newspaper. From July 29 to August 26, a total of 46 readers participated in this discussion. In their letters, in addition to expressing their support for the critics, they criticized Chang Ganchen and others for suppressing criticism, believing that they were afraid of exposing shortcomings in their work, as if "microorganisms cannot see the sunlight." In addition to hoping that the Mianyang County Committee would help Chang Ganchen and others to seriously examine themselves in a short commentary, the newspaper also sent people to the site for investigation.

    Thanks to the persistent struggle of the Hubei Daily, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Mianyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China made a new decision, giving Chang Ganchen and Qi Guobiao party disciplinary actions (public warning to Chang Ganchen, public admonishment to Qi Guobiao), and District Committee Secretary Xia Fuqing made a profound self-criticism. Chang Ganchen and others also made a public self-criticism in the newspaper, believing that the main reason for this mistake was "a lack of correct understanding of developing criticism and self-criticism in newspapers," and expressed that they would "strengthen their studies" and "correct these mistakes" in the future. (See Hubei Daily, September 13)

    Similar incidents of rudely suppressing criticism like those of Chang Ganchen and others have also occurred among some party members and cadres in other regions. For example, Cao Guozhi, director of the Jianchang County Tax Bureau in Rehe, suppressed critical manuscripts and prevented them from being sent to the newspaper; Liu Xiangchen, manager of the Jilin City Native Products Company, and Xu Guanlie, secretary of the branch, suppressed critics on the grounds that the manuscript was not "approved"; Hao Yushan, director of the Construction Department of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government, refused criticism and attacked reporters. These incidents of suppressing criticism show that the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Developing Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" has been issued for nearly a year and a half; however, many party members and cadres, and even some leading cadres and party organizations, still have varying degrees of resistance to mass criticism. This cannot but continue to attract the serious attention of party organizations in various regions.

    In order to continue to implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others have strongly supported the criticism of the newspapers. The Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on October 9 to party organizations and discipline inspection commissions at all levels to carry out studies against the suppression of criticism, and to examine violations of party discipline in the suppression of criticism. The directly affiliated party committee of the directly affiliated organs of the Central South Military and Political Committee also issued a notice to organize this study at the same time. Undoubtedly, these spirits and measures of upholding the principles of the Party and mobilizing the masses to launch a resolute struggle against the bureaucratic suppression of criticism are completely correct.

    However, some party organizations and newspapers do not have a sufficient understanding of the necessity of conscientiously implementing the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and therefore, in carrying out mass criticism, they often act rashly, abandon principles, and end without finishing. For example, the Xi'an Mass Daily on August 14 used a large space on the front page to expose and criticize Hao Yushan, director of the Construction Department of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government and a party member, for suppressing criticism, which was necessary. But nearly two months have passed, and the suppressor of criticism has not expressed his attitude in the newspaper. The party organization of the Ningxia Provincial Government has also not expressed its opinion on the handling of this issue. For example, the "Reader's Letters" column of the newspaper on August 19 also published four "Opinions on Hao Yushan's Suppression of Criticism," and the "Editor's Note" stated: "Such opinions will be published successively in the future." But there has been no follow-up since then. Therefore, it is hoped that the newspaper and the party group of the Ningxia Provincial Government will adhere to the principles of criticism and self-criticism and clarify this matter. Only in this way can errors be completely eliminated and the purity of the Party be maintained.

### 向压制批评的官僚主义作风作坚决斗争

    向压制批评的官僚主义作风作坚决斗争
    在报纸上开展批评与自我批评，是“提高人民群众的觉悟性和积极性，吸引人民群众踊跃参加国家建设事业的严重步骤。”（中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”）。但有些党员干部，甚至某些领导干部和党的组织，对此仍认识不清，因而对批评者不是“采取欢迎与保护的革命态度”，而是采取了打击与压制的蛮横态度。湖北沔阳县第一区党员干部昌干臣等压制批评、打击批评者的事件，就是一个典型的例子。
    湖北日报六月十一日“读者来信”栏，曾刊登了批评中共沔阳县第一区委员会某区委不重视抗美援朝工作的信件。但该区党员干部昌干臣、祁国标等竟认为写稿人——中共沔阳县委员会党员干部胡克庆是故意找“岔子”，便辱骂胡克庆是“特务”，是“破坏一区工作”，要将胡送公安局法办，并动手打了胡克庆两下。祁国标则提起板凳要打胡克庆，并说打死胡，他“情愿去坐牢”，后被人阻止。对于这种压制批评的严重事件，该县的县委宣传部长徐子溶、一区区委书记夏甫庆却漠然视之，只对昌干臣等轻描淡写地批评了一下，反转过来，却让胡克庆检讨写稿态度。这是完全丧失原则的作法。
    湖北日报与这种压制批评的官僚主义倾向进行了一系列的思想斗争。该报在收到胡克庆的申诉书后，即转交中共湖北省委员会纪律检查委员会。湖北省委纪律检查委员会即指示中共沔阳县委员会纪律检查委员会迅速处理这一事件。但沔阳县委会竟采取了官僚主义的态度，将这一问题拖延了一个月之后，反而作出用组织手段压制批评者的错误决定：建议中共湖北洪山县委员会处分胡克庆（胡此时已调洪山县工作）。湖北日报为坚持党的批评和自我批评的原则，除拒绝发表上述错误决定外，并在报纸上发动读者展开了对这一问题的讨论。从七月二十九日至八月二十六日止，共有四十六位读者参加了这一讨论。他们在来信中除表示支持批评者外，并批判了昌干臣等压制批评的错误，认为他们是怕揭发工作中的缺点，好像“微生物见不得阳光”一样。该报除在短论中，希望沔阳县委员会帮助昌干臣等认真进行检讨以外，又派人到现场进行了调查。
    由于湖北日报的坚持斗争，中共沔阳县委员会纪律检查委员会才作出新的决定，分别给予昌干臣、祁国标以党的纪律处分（昌干臣当众警告、祁国标当众劝告），区委书记夏甫庆作深刻检讨。昌干臣等并在报纸上作了公开检讨，认为造成这一错误的主要原因，是“对于在报纸上开展批评和自我批评缺乏正确的认识”，并表示今后要“加强学习”“改正这些错误”。（见九月十三日湖北日报）
    类似昌干臣等这样蛮横地压制批评的事件，在其他地区的某些党员干部中也曾经发生过。例如热河建昌县税务局长曹国治把批评稿压起来，不让寄给报社；吉林市土产公司经理刘向臣、支部书记许观烈，藉口写稿没经过“批准”，来压制批评者；宁夏省人民政府建设厅长郝玉山拒绝批评，打击记者。这些压制批评的事件说明，中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，虽然已发布了将近一年半之久；但仍有不少党员干部甚至一些领导干部和党的组织，对于群众批评，存在着程度不同的抵抗思想。这就不能不继续引起各地党组织的严重注意。
    为了继续贯彻中共中央决定，中共中央中南局、中共湖北省委员会等曾有力地支持了报纸的批评。中共中央中南局更于十月九日指示各级党的组织和纪律检查委员会开展反对压制批评的学习，并检查压制批评的违反党纪行为。中共中南军政委员会直属机关直属党委亦同时发出通知组织此项学习。无疑的，这些坚持党的原则和发动群众向压制批评的官僚主义者展开坚决斗争的精神和措施，是完全正确的。
    但是，有些党的组织和报纸对于认真贯彻中共中央决定的必要性还认识不足，因而在开展群众性的批评中，常常发生草率从事、放弃原则和有头无尾的现象。例如，八月十四日的西安群众日报曾以第一版很大的篇幅揭发和批评了宁夏省人民政府建设厅厅长、党员郝玉山压制批评的事件，这是必要的。但至今已将近两月，压制批评者一直没有在报纸上表示态度。宁夏省政府党组织也没有表示对这一问题处理的意见。又如，该报八月十九日的“读者来信”栏，也曾发表了四篇“对郝玉山压制批评的意见”，“编者按”中并表明：“今后将陆续发表此种意见”。但此后也一直没有再见下文。因此，希望该报和宁夏省政府党组坚持批评和自我批评的原则，把这一事情交代清楚。只有这样才能彻底消除错误，保持党的纯洁。
