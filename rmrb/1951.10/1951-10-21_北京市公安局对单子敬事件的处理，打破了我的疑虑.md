    The Handling of the Shan Zijing Incident by the Beijing Public Security Bureau Dispelled My Doubts
    To the Editor:
    After reading the article "The Beijing Public Security Bureau's Account of the Wrongful Arrest of Citizen Shan Zijing and a Review of This Error" published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the October 5th People's Daily, I deeply felt that the people's public security organs are truly loyal and responsible to the people. In the past, I had the following idea: the measures for vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries are completely correct, but among the large number of counter-revolutionaries arrested, are there any individual "good people"? The Shan Zijing incident dispelled my doubts. I have also received a profound education from this matter. The people's public security personnel fight against counter-revolutionaries day and night to protect the lives and property of the people across the country, to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and to guarantee the economic construction of new China, eliminating harm for the people. It is difficult to completely avoid a small number of cadres being careless for a moment and making mistakes like the arrest of Shan Zijing. However, our government does not conceal or evade such accidental mistakes, but rather handles them seriously and conscientiously. This is the clearest possible contrast to the Kuomintang bandit gang's murderous policy of "better to kill a thousand innocent people than to let one guilty person go free." I now truly realize that the People's Government will never let a counter-revolutionary element escape, but it will also never wrong a good person.

### 北京市公安局对单子敬事件的处理，打破了我的疑虑

    北京市公安局对单子敬事件的处理，打破了我的疑虑编辑同志：
    看了十月五日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载的“北京市公安局错捕市民单子敬的经过及对这个错误的检讨”一文，我深深地体会到人民的公安机关真是对人民忠实负责的。过去我曾有过这样的想法：大张旗鼓镇压反革命的措施是完全正确的，但所捕的大批反革命分子当中，是不是会有个别“好人”呢？单子敬事件打破了我的疑虑。我并从这件事情中受到了深刻的教育。人民的公安人员为了保卫全国人民的生命财产，为了巩固人民民主专政，为了保障新中国的经济建设，日日夜夜地与反革命分子作斗争，为人民除害。极个别的干部一时粗心，犯了类似逮捕单子敬这样的错误，是难于完全避免的。可是，我们的政府对待这种偶然发生的错误，既不掩饰，更不逃避，而是严肃认真地作了处理。这和国民党匪帮“宁可错杀一千，不可放过一个”的杀人政策，真是最显明不过的对比。我现在真正体会到：人民政府是绝不让一个反革命分子漏网，但也绝不冤枉一个好人的。
