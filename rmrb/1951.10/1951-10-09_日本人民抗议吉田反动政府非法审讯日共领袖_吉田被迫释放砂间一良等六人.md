Xinhua News Agency, dated 5th: According to a TASS dispatch dated 2nd: As previously reported, on September 4th, the Japanese government ordered the arrest of many leaders of the Japanese Communist Party. Among the arrested communist leaders were Eiichi Iwata and Kanichi Kawakami, members of the Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party. On September 28th, the Tokyo District Court opened a trial against them on charges of anti-American activities. Kanichi Kawakami's "crime" was publishing his speech in the Diet on January 27th in the magazine "New World." Iwata Eiichi's "crime" was distributing an article entitled "The Anniversary of Japan's Surrender" among the staff of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in August. The defendants and defense lawyers lodged a firm protest against these accusations. Kawakami Kanichi said: This is nothing more than an act of political persecution. Iwata Eiichi pointed out: The arrest of Japanese communists at the beginning of September coincided with the San Francisco Conference, which was to facilitate the conclusion of the American-made "peace treaty" that the Japanese people did not want.

The Ministry of Justice has banned the Tokyo Committee of the Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Together with the Masses." At the same time, the police searched the editorial office of the "World Peace" newspaper and made arrests.

Not long ago, the leadership of the Japan Peace Protection Committee protested to Ohashi, the president of the Ministry of Justice, against the arrest of Yoshiroku Hosokawa and Kanichi Kawakami, members of the Standing Committee of the association, and against the suppression of supporters of the peace movement.

In addition: The Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Society has also issued a declaration protesting the Yoshida reactionary government's illegal order to arrest leaders of the Japanese Communist Party.

Editor's Note: Under the protest of the Japanese people, the Yoshida government was forced to release six other Japanese Communist Party leaders arrested on September 4th on September 26th, namely: Kazuyoshi Sunama, Kentaro Yamabe, Yoshiroku Hosokawa, Yuichi Horie, Kazuo Fukumoto, and Susumu Kamimura. However, the Yoshida government still illegally subjected them to "purge."

    日本人民抗议吉田反动政府非法审讯日共领袖
    吉田被迫释放砂间一良等六人
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社二日讯：前已报道，九月四日日本政府下令逮捕许多日本共产党领袖。被捕的共产党领袖中有日共临时中央指导部委员岩田英一和川上贯一。九月二十八日东京地方法院以反美活动罪开庭审讯他们。川上贯一的“罪名”是在“新世界”杂志上发表了他在一月二十七日在国会中所作的讲演。岩田英一的“罪名”是什么他在八月间曾在东京都政府的工作人员中散发“日本投降的周年纪念”一文。被告和辩护人对这种控告提出坚决抗议。川上贯一说：这不过是一种政治迫害行为。岩田英一指出：九月初逮捕日本共产党人的行动正与旧金山会议同时发生，这是为了使日本人民所不愿意的美制“和约”易于缔结。
    法务府已查禁日本共产党东京委员会机关报“和群众一起”。同时，警察曾抄查“世界和平”报的编辑部并进行逮捕。
    不久以前，日本拥护和平委员会领导机关曾向法务府总裁大桥抗议逮捕该会常任委员会委员细川嘉六和川上贯一，并抗议对和平运动拥护者的镇压行动。
    又讯：日本劳农救援会也曾发表宣言，抗议吉田反动政府非法下令逮捕日本共产党领袖。
    按：在日本人民的抗议下，吉田政府于九月二十六日被迫释放了九月四日逮捕的其他日共领袖六人，即：砂间一良、山边健太郎、细川嘉六、堀江邑一、福本和夫、上村进。但是，吉田政府仍非法地对他们加以“整肃”。
