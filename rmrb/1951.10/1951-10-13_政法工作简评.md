Brief Comments on Political and Legal Work
    Oppose Arranged Marriages

    According to investigations, the feudal system of arranged or disguised arranged marriages still exists to a considerable extent in some rural areas.

    In the land reform movement, the broad masses of Chinese peasants overthrew the landlord class, demonstrating their resolute courage in opposing the feudal land system. However, on the other hand, some peasants' feudal ideas on women's issues and marriage issues are so deeply rooted that they are not easily eradicated. Many parents still treat their children's marriage issues with old feudal concepts. Many peasant women still cannot make their own decisions about their marriages and can only be manipulated and bought and sold under feudal patriarchal rule. Some parents think that asking the man for more money will benefit their daughters, but they do not know that doing so is precisely ruining their daughters' happiness. Some rural women still hold the dependent idea of "marry a man for food and clothing" and do not realize that if they want to break feudal ideas, they can only improve their status in the family and society and create a happy and beautiful life by actively participating in labor.

    The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China clearly stipulates the abolition of arranged and forced feudal marriage systems, and stipulates that "no one is allowed to solicit property by taking advantage of marriage." However, traditional old feudal ideas stubbornly hinder the implementation of the Marriage Law.

    The existence of the feudal system of arranged marriages is extremely detrimental to peasants. This system makes it impossible for them to "afford to marry a wife" as in the old society, or it causes them to spend a lot of money, incur debts, or even go bankrupt because of "marrying a wife." More seriously, this feudal marriage relationship completely violates the principle of free will as stipulated in the Marriage Law, and even if they are forced to marry, it will not lead to family harmony and will hinder the development of production. In the past, many incidents of beating and abusing women and killing women often stemmed from the system of arranged marriages.

    Replacing the feudal marriage system with the New Democratic marriage system is a fierce struggle. This struggle has only just begun. The fact that arranged marriages or disguised arranged marriages still exist in some rural areas tells us that the publicity and education work on the Marriage Law in the past was far from enough. We must do a good job in publicizing the Marriage Law among the broad masses of people, expose the harm of feudal marriages, and promote the benefits of the new marriage system to raise the awareness of men and women. At the same time, for betrothal gifts and money with a commercial nature, if they are delivered after the implementation of the Marriage Law (especially in the old liberated areas), they should in principle be confiscated to punish lawbreakers and educate the broad masses. Only in this way can the feudal system of arranged marriages be eliminated.

    政法工作简评
    反对买卖婚姻
    据调查，目前在若干农村中还相当严重地存在着封建的买卖婚姻制度，或变相的买卖婚姻。
    中国广大地区的农民，在土地改革运动中推翻了地主阶级，表现了他们反对封建土地制度的坚决勇敢，但是，在另一方面，在对待妇女问题与婚姻问题上，一部分农民的封建思想却是那样地根深蒂固，不易一下肃清。许多做父母的，仍以封建的旧观念来对待自己儿女的婚姻问题。许多农民的女儿，对于自己的婚姻大事至今仍不能自主，只能在封建的家长统治下任人支配，任人买来卖去。有些做父母的，以为多向男方索取财物会对女儿有利，岂不知这样做，正是葬送自己女儿的幸福。一部分农村妇女至今也还抱着“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的依赖思想，没有认识到如要打破封建思想，只有积极参加劳动，才能改善自己在家庭中与社会上的地位，才能创造幸福美好的生活。
    在中华人民共和国婚姻法中，明确规定了废除包办、强迫的封建婚姻制度，并且规定“禁止任何人借婚姻关系问题索取财物”。但是，传统的旧的封建思想，却顽固地阻碍着婚姻法的贯彻执行。
    封建的买卖婚姻制度的存在，对于农民是极端不利的。这种制度使他们仍像在旧社会一样“娶不起老婆”，或是因“娶老婆”而大量破费、负债乃至破产。而更严重的是，这种封建婚姻关系，完全违背了婚姻法所规定的自主自愿的原则，即使勉强结婚，也不能使家庭和睦，也将妨碍生产的发展。过去不少打骂妇女、虐杀妇女的事件，其根源往往是发生于买卖婚姻制度。
    用新民主主义的婚姻制度来代替封建的婚姻制度是一场激烈的斗争。这个斗争现在还刚刚开始。若干农村中买卖婚姻制度或变相的买卖婚姻仍然存在的这一事实告诉我们，过去关于婚姻法的宣传教育工作是做得太不够了。我们必须很好地在广大人民群众中进行婚姻法的宣传，揭露封建婚姻的害处，宣传新婚姻制度的好处，以提高男女群众的觉悟。同时，对于买卖性质的聘礼、聘金，如果是在婚姻法实施之后交付的（特别是老区），原则上应予以没收，以制裁违法分子，教育广大群众。只有这样，才能消灭封建的买卖婚姻制度。
