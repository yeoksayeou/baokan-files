    Letter from a Reader:
    The criticisms made by comrades Zhou Yuting and three other students from the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School against our bureau are generally correct and worthy of our deep self-reflection. When the Beijing Municipal Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School was established, there were indeed significant objective difficulties. The issue of school buildings caused the school's opening to be delayed by three months. The main cadres of the school (such as the principal and the director of studies) were also resolved with the help of the Central Ministry of Education.
    We have heard the reasoning that "Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary Schools cultivate new-type intellectual cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds to become the backbone of New China's construction," and we have also told the students this, but ideologically, we did not truly regard running the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School as "a major event, a new political task." Therefore, after the issues of school buildings and main cadres were initially resolved, we did not make further efforts to help resolve some of the school's problems, and even adopted a bureaucratic attitude of procrastination. Now, we will provide a self-critical response to the opinions they raised, as follows:
    (1) School Building Issue: We originally planned to use the old site of the National People's College as the school building, but later the Government Administration Council allocated the site to the Russian Language Institute and approved a special fund to build a new school building for the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School. The Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School would temporarily use the old site of the Weiying Hutong Finance School while waiting for the new school building to be constructed. Because the temporary school building was small, the students' health was indeed affected. Over the past year, the school has tried to rent and buy houses, but the rent for renting houses was very high; buying houses required asking the residents to move, which was a great difficulty. After encountering difficulties, our bureau failed to actively help rent better temporary school buildings, and has been waiting for the allocation of funds to build a new school building, which is something we should criticize ourselves for. In September of this year, the Government Administration Council allocated 2 billion yuan, and the Municipal People's Government subsidized 1.6 billion yuan. Construction has now begun outside Fuchengmen, and it is estimated that it will be completed by the end of November this year, and the school building issue will be resolved.
    (2) Cadre Issue: After the Ministry of Education helped us solve the main cadre issue, we developed a dependent mentality and did not pay attention to leading and helping the school in its teaching work. The most significant issue was that after a problem of disunity arose between the school's principal and the director of studies, we did not investigate and resolve it for a long time, which led to a phenomenon of mutual buck-passing in their work. After the original director of studies was transferred during the summer vacation this year, we did not promptly replace him, which was our main mistake. We did not earnestly implement the spirit of "ensuring the selection of the best cadres and teachers," which resulted in some teachers being unqualified, and even after replacing them, we did not promptly fill the vacancies. We have now decided to transfer a history teacher from the current teachers of the municipal middle school to fill the vacancy, and it will be completed in the coming days. As for the statement that "workers and peasants have low cultural levels, so just find someone who can teach literacy!" we did not say that, and Principal Wang has also corrected the above statement. Secondly, the illiterate administrator of the school was indeed due to the principal's improper hiring, but we cannot shirk our responsibility for failing to check, and we have now replaced him with a suitable person.
    (3) Student Welfare Issues: In March and April of this year, Comrade Liu from our bureau who was in charge of cadre welfare took leave for childbirth, and the comrade who was temporarily taking over the work was unfamiliar with the situation and system, which did result in a backlog of issues. We have already made a self-criticism to the school regarding this matter (Comrade Liu's work has improved after returning).
    (4) Increasing Classes: Because the new school building will not be completed until November, the current school building cannot accommodate the newly enrolled students. We are now planning to find a way to rent houses. If we cannot rent them, we will have to wait until the new school building is completed before opening new classes. As for the uneven progress between the newly recruited classes and the preparatory classes, we plan to solve it with methods such as make-up classes during the winter vacation.
    In addition to striving to correct the above errors, we will pay special attention to deeply implementing the policy of education serving workers and peasants and further improving the Workers and Peasants Cadre School.

### 北京市文教局的检讨

专栏：读者来信

    北京市文教局的检讨编辑同志：
    工农速成中学周玉亭等四位同学对我局的批评意见，总的说来是正确的，是值得我们深刻检讨的。北京市工农速成中学开办的时候，的确存在很大的客观困难。因为校舍问题，曾经使该校的开学延期三月之久。该校主要干部（如校长、教导主任），也是在中央教育部帮助之下才获得解决的。
    “工农速成中学培养工农出身的新型知识分子干部，成为新中国建设的骨干”的道理，我们是听过了，而且也向同学们讲了，但思想上并没有真正把办工农速成中学当成“是一件大事，是一种新的政治任务”。因此，在校舍和主要干部问题得到初步的解决之后，就对该校的若干问题，没有进一步尽力帮助解决，甚至采取了官僚主义的拖延态度。现在就他们所提的意见，作检讨答复如下：
    （一）校舍问题：我们原定利用民国学院旧址作该校校舍，后因政务院将该处拨归俄文专科学校，允许另拨专款为工农速成中学新建校舍。工农速成中学则暂用未英胡同财经学校旧址，等候修建新校舍。因为临时校舍狭小，学生卫生健康方面确受了影响。一年来，该校曾经租房和买房，但租房房租很高；买房又须请住户搬家，这是很大的困难。遭到困难后，我局未能积极帮助租借更好的临时校舍，而一直等候拨款盖新校舍，这是应该检讨的。今年九月间政务院已拨款二十亿元，市人民政府又补助十六亿元，现并已着手在阜成门外动工修建，估计今年十一月底可以完工，该校校舍问题，即可得到解决。
    （二）干部问题：在教育部帮助我们解决主要干部之后，我们曾产生了依赖思想，在教学工作上，也没有注意对该校实行领导和帮助。最显著的是该校校长和教导主任发生了不团结问题之后，我们很久没有加以调查解决，以致一度形成双方在工作上互相推诿的现象。在今年暑假中原教导主任调职之后，我们又未及时配备，这是我们的主要错误。我们没有认真贯彻“保证抽调最好的干部和教师”的精神，以致个别教师不称职，甚至调换之后，也没有及时配备。现在尚缺的一位历史教员，我们已决定从市立中学现任教师中抽调，日内即可配备齐全。至于“工农分子文化低，去个教字的就行啦！”的话，我们并未说过，王校长也更正了以上的话。其次，该校不识字的管理员，固然由于校长聘请不当，但是我们疏于检查，也不能辞责，现已另请了一位适当的人接替。
    （三）学生福利问题：今年三、四月间，我局管干部福利的刘同志因生产请假，兼代工作的同志因对情况制度不熟悉，确有积压问题的现象。关于此事我们已向该校作过检讨（刘同志回来后，工作已改进）。
    （四）增班问题：因新校舍十一月才能完工，新招学生目前校舍无法容纳，现拟设法租借房屋，如不能租借，就只好等候新校舍落成后再开班。至于新收班和预备班进度不齐的问题，拟以寒假补课等办法解决。
    对于上述错误，我们除了努力改正外，今后更要特别注意深入贯彻教育为工农服务的政策方针，更进一步地办好工农干部学校。
