Telegram of Congratulations from the Tibetan Local Government to the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

To all members of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

    The notice inviting the Tibetan Local Government to send representatives to the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held in the capital, Beijing, has been forwarded by Representative Zhang Jingwu. We should have participated in jointly discussing national affairs, but due to the long journey, we were unable to arrive on time. We will send representatives to the next meeting. We hereby send our apologies and wish the conference success.

    The Kashag of the Tibetan Local Government
    October 19, 1951

    西藏地方政府致人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议贺电中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会各位委员：
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在北京首都召开的第三次会议，承邀请西藏地方政府派代表的通知，已由张经武代表转到。本应参加共同协商国事，实因旅途遥远不能按时赶到，容下次会议当再遵派代表出席。谨电致歉，并祝会议成功。
