    What Should We Learn From Lu Xun?
    Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death
        Hu Sheng
    Comrade Mao Zedong has already made a correct assessment of Mr. Lu Xun's position in the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Lu Xun is the main general of the Chinese cultural revolution. He is not only a great writer, but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary." Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "Lu Xun, the communist," is "a great man of the Chinese cultural revolution." (Both quotations are from "On New Democracy")
    The cultural and ideological front occupies an important position in the revolution. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the Kuomintang reactionaries used two kinds of reactionary encirclements and suppressions to deal with the revolution led by the Communist Party: military encirclement and suppression and cultural encirclement and suppression. The revolutionary people responded with two kinds of revolutionary deepening: the deepening of the rural revolution and the deepening of the cultural revolution. The result of these two revolutionary deepenings was the awakening of the people of the whole country, the complete and utter defeat of the reactionary forces militarily and culturally, and the great victory of the New Democratic Revolution. During the twenty years of Kuomintang rule, reactionary cultural encirclement and suppression never ceased for a single day. In the first ten years, Lu Xun was the main general who broke through this encirclement and suppression and persisted in the deepening of the cultural revolution. In the last ten years, although Lu Xun was no longer with us, Lu Xun's banner was still the great banner of the Chinese people's cultural revolution.
    Now our situation is completely different from that of Lu Xun's time. But we must continue to uphold the deepening of the cultural revolution on the basis of the victory of the great Chinese people's revolution. The struggle on the ideological front is no less important now than it was in the past; on the contrary, it is even more important. The New Democratic Revolution has been victorious, but our revolution has not ended. We must carry out tremendous transformation work in all sectors of social life; we must unremittingly suppress the enemies who have been overthrown; we must fight to the end against the imperialists who hate us; we must promote the patriotic spirit of the people of the whole country, defend our country, and practice thrift and economy, and build our country with the same spirit of hard work as in the revolutionary war. Our country must eventually move towards the bright future of socialism and communism. These are all serious tasks of struggle facing the people. What do we rely on to accomplish this task? Fundamentally speaking, we rely on the enhancement of the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people, the ideological unity of the broad masses of the people, and the solid unity based on ideological unity. For this reason, we must carry out in-depth cultural and ideological work, and in-depth struggle on the ideological front. All literary and art workers, scientific workers, and cultural and educational workers should conscientiously learn from Lu Xun, and work as resolutely, bravely, and faithfully as Lu Xun for the great cause of the progress and development of our country.
    What should we learn from Lu Xun?
    We should learn from Lu Xun's strong political nature.
    Why is it said that Lu Xun is not only a great writer, but also a great revolutionary? Because Lu Xun has always explicitly affirmed that his literary work serves a political purpose, which is related to transforming China's old politics, old economy, old ideology, and establishing new politics, new economy, and new ideology. Lu Xun is a great patriot among the Chinese people. As early as before the Revolution of 1911, he had already embarked on his literary career with the aim of transforming his motherland. The failure of the revolution led by the bourgeoisie caused him pain. After continuous pursuit and exploration, he finally found Marxism-Leninism and recognized the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. He saw the future of the world in the socialist construction cause of the Soviet Union, and he saw the future of China in the revolutionary cause of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. In the last ten years of Lu Xun's life of struggle, he publicly declared that his cause was closely integrated with the proletarian revolutionary cause.
    Lu Xun, before he became a communist, already extremely hated the empty talk of "art for art's sake." Lu Xun could not tolerate the situation where writers were comfortably hiding in their own small world while the broad masses of the people were suffering and struggling. Marxist-Leninist thought, communist thought, enabled Lu Xun to thoroughly solve the question of what purpose literature and art serve and whom they serve. Lu Xun called on revolutionary writers to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He himself truly did as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "be a 'cow' for the proletariat and the masses of the people, and work until his last breath."
    When Comrade Mao Zedong explained the direction of literary and art workers, he said: A fundamental question in literature and art is the question of for the masses and how to be for the masses. Lu Xun never regarded his own work as an isolated matter divorced from the masses of the people. He always evaluated his work according to the interests of the people, so his work showed a high degree of political nature. Lu Xun did not regard literary and art work as the expression of the individual talent of the petty bourgeoisie, but as a serious political undertaking. This point should be learned not only by literary and art workers, but also by all comrades engaged in cultural and ideological work.
    We should also learn from Lu Xun's realistic approach.
    Lu Xun's strong political nature is inseparable from his realistic approach. Many of Lu Xun's writings are used to criticize the hypocrisy, pretentiousness, self-deception, and inconsistency between words and deeds in the old society; this is the style of the feudal ruling class, the style of compradors in semi-colonial society, the style of shameless bureaucrats, and the style of hypocritical "celebrities." Lu Xun extremely hated this style. He did a great deal of struggle to educate the people not to be contaminated by this style. Lu Xun himself was extremely serious and down-to-earth in his work. Anything he thought should be done, he would definitely do seriously, and he would definitely do it well. He would never put up an empty shelf, but in reality have nothing.
    Petty-bourgeois revolutionaries often lack this realistic style. Lu Xun, the communist, once made strict and correct criticisms of petty-bourgeois revolutionaries in this regard. Lu Xun could not tolerate the style of empty talk without doing practical work.
    The realistic approach is the style of Marxism-Leninism, the style of Comrade Mao Zedong. This style is very valuable. In the current cultural and artistic work, there are still phenomena of only pursuing superficial excitement, not doing practical work, and not investigating the actual effect of the work, so we should all learn well from Lu Xun.
    We should also learn from Lu Xun's fighting spirit, and carry out ideological struggle as correctly and bravely as Lu Xun.
    It is precisely because Lu Xun has a firm political stance and a realistic style that he has been able to do extremely important work on the ideological front, and his achievements have immortal value for the Chinese people and the Chinese revolutionary cause.
    Lu Xun is a staunch fighter on the ideological front. "Lu Xun's bones are the hardest." In the Kuomintang-ruled areas, he waged sharp, close-quarters struggles against imperialism, compradorism, fascist rulers, and all their big and small running dogs. No matter what high-sounding names they put forward, Lu Xun always ruthlessly exposed them, so that the people could clearly see their ugly and vicious true faces. When Lu Xun did this, it was clear that he did not have any guarantee of his own safety.
    The ideological struggles Lu Xun carried out all started from a firm stance and were principled. When he attacked the enemies in front of him, he did indeed not give an inch, and he never relaxed even if the other party had become a "stray dog." He also criticized friends. In Lu Xun, there was a clear distinction between criticism of friends and attacks on enemies. For those characters who had once mixed in the revolution and then "crawled" out of the revolution, Lu Xun's whipping was merciless; but for the friends on the revolutionary front that he had once criticized, he still called for cooperation under political principles to carry out the struggle against the enemy together. However, if it is said that since they are friends, even if there are mistakes or shortcomings, they should tolerate each other, Lu Xun absolutely does not recognize this statement.
    Comrade Stalin once criticized the bad style of "solving problems in a family-style and household-style way." Stalin said: "If we, the representatives of the proletarian revolution, turn a blind eye to our shortcomings, solve problems in a family-style way, cover up our own mistakes with each other, and drive the virus into the organism of our party, then who will correct these mistakes, these shortcomings?" Comrade Stalin was talking here about the issue of criticism within the Communist Party. In the revolutionary cultural workers and literary and art workers, it is absolutely not allowed to handle problems in a family-style way and cover up mistakes. Lu Xun's spirit of daring to criticize and self-criticize is our model. Through criticism and self-criticism, we can achieve ideological unity in principle, and thus achieve solid unity.
    Lu Xun's fighting spirit is very much needed in our current cultural and artistic work. Never peacefully coexist with reactionary ideas, never tolerate erroneous ideas without principle, whether these erroneous ideas are in oneself or in others. This spirit is essential for us at all times.
    We must also learn from Lu Xun's spirit of constantly transforming himself through learning and struggle, and pursuing truth.
    Lu Xun progressed from a thorough democrat in the old democratic revolution to a communist in the new democratic revolution. In the process of his ideological development, it was not smooth and steady, always moving forward. In the middle of this, he must have gone through strict self-criticism and fierce ideological struggle. Lu Xun was as intolerant of his own shortcomings as he was of the shortcomings of his friends. Intellectuals are often prone to self-deception and complacency, but Lu Xun is a person who dares to expose the old elements in his own thoughts; he is a person who dares to conquer his own old thoughts with new thoughts. In this regard, Lu Xun can be a model for all intellectuals in the process of self-transformation.
    Before Lu Xun became a communist, some elements of his thoughts were incompatible with Marxism. Lu Xun, while working and struggling, earnestly studied the Marxist books he could obtain at that time. Once he discovered that the truth was here, he abandoned his old thoughts without hesitation and firmly stood on the new position.
    In the past two years, literary and art workers, scientific workers, and cultural and educational workers across the country have generally carried out the study of Marxism-Leninism. There has been great progress in cultural and ideological work. Since the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" was launched, the work of ideological criticism has also become active. These are all good phenomena, but there are still great shortcomings in our work on the ideological front. The appearance of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" has already shown that some Communist Party comrades engaged in cultural work are still unable to keenly distinguish between bourgeois reactionary ideas and proletarian ideas, and are still unable to handle all ideological work with the necessary serious political attitude. Our school education has not yet been thoroughly transformed in accordance with the needs of the new democratic country. In various cultural and artistic works, the necessary and correct ideological criticism has not been fully unfolded. In many places, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies are still expressed, and even destructive reactionary ideas appear. Our scientific research work—including social sciences and natural sciences—is still relatively weak and cannot adapt to the needs of the national life and social life that are developing and progressing every day. For the social history of China, it is particularly necessary to use the principles and methods of Marxism to conduct in-depth research and criticize various erroneous opinions. We have done too little work in this area.
    Therefore, we must greatly improve and strengthen cultural and ideological work in various departments. The literary and art workers, scientific workers, educational workers, and all other ideological workers of New China must more earnestly carry out learning and self-transformation, and strive to improve their Marxist ideological level. This is precisely the basic key to improving and strengthening cultural and ideological work.
    Taking Lu Xun, the great pioneer of the revolutionary culture of the Chinese people, as a model, the intellectuals and cultural workers of New China should more bravely and diligently strive to transform and improve themselves. We must make our work better and more effectively serve the people, serve the country, and serve the great cause of the Chinese revolution.

    我们要向鲁迅学习什么？
    纪念鲁迅先生逝世十五周年
        胡绳
    对于鲁迅先生在中国革命中的地位，毛泽东同志已经做了正确的估价。毛泽东同志说：“鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家与伟大的革命家。”毛泽东同志又说：“共产主义者的鲁迅”，是“中国文化革命的伟人。”（均见《新民主主义论》）
    文化思想战线在革命中是占有重要地位的。如同毛泽东同志所说，国民党反动派曾用两种反动围剿对付共产党所领导的革命：军事的围剿和文化的围剿。革命的人民用两种革命深入来答复它：农村革命深入和文化革命深入。这两种革命深入的结果是全国人民的觉悟，是反动势力在军事上和在文化上的彻底惨败，是新民主主义革命的伟大胜利。国民党统治的二十年中，没有一天停止过反动的文化围剿。在前十年中，鲁迅是冲破这种围剿而坚持了文化革命深入的主将，后十年中，虽然鲁迅已经不在了，但是鲁迅的旗帜仍旧是中国人民的文化革命的伟大旗帜。
    现在我们的处境已和鲁迅的当年完全不同。但我们必须在中国人民大革命胜利的基础上继续坚持文化革命的深入。思想战线上的斗争，在现在并不比过去较不重要一些，相反的，却是更加重要了。新民主主义革命是胜利了，但我们的革命并没有终结。我们要在社会生活的各个部门中进行巨大的改造工作；我们要毫不松懈地镇压已被打倒的敌人；我们要和仇视我们的帝国主义者斗争到底；我们要发扬全国人民的爱国精神，卫护我们的国家，并且厉行节约，用像进行革命战争一样的艰苦精神来建设我们的国家。我们的国家最后还一定要走向社会主义和共产主义的光辉前途。这些都是摆在人民面前的严重的斗争任务。我们靠什么来完成这种任务呢？根本地说来，我们所依靠的是广大人民的政治觉悟提高，是广大人民在思想上的一致和在思想一致的基础上的巩固的团结。为此，我们就必须深入地进行文化思想工作，深入地进行思想战线上的斗争。一切文艺工作者，科学工作者，文化教育工作者都应该认真地向鲁迅学习，要和鲁迅同样坚决地，勇敢地，忠实地为我们的国家的进步和发展的伟大事业而工作。
    我们应该向鲁迅学习些什么呢？
    我们应该学习鲁迅的坚强的政治性。
    为什么说鲁迅不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的革命家呢？因为鲁迅从来就是明明白白地肯定，他的文学工作是服务于一种政治目的的，这种政治目的是和改造中国的旧政治、旧经济、旧思想、建立新政治、新经济、新思想相联系的。鲁迅是中国人民中的伟大的爱国者。早在辛亥革命以前，他已抱着改造自己的祖国的目的而开始他的文艺事业。资产阶级领导的革命失败了，这使他感到苦痛，经过不断的追求和探索，他终于找到了马克思列宁主义，认识了无产阶级的革命事业。他从苏联的社会主义建设事业中看到了世界的前途，他从以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的革命事业中看到了中国的前途。在鲁迅一生奋斗的最后十年间，他公开宣布他的事业是和无产阶级革命事业紧相结合的。
    鲁迅，在他成为共产主义者以前，已经极端憎恶“为文艺而文艺”的空谈。在广大人民遭遇苦难和进行斗争的时候，文学家躲在自己的小天地里怡然自得的情况，是鲁迅所不能忍受的。马克思列宁主义思想，共产主义思想使鲁迅彻底解决了文艺是为什么目的和为什么人服务的问题。鲁迅号召革命的作家要为工农大众服务。他自己真正做到了像毛泽东同志所说的，“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”。
    毛泽东同志在说明文艺工作者的方向时说：文艺上的一个根本问题就是为群众和如何为群众的问题。鲁迅从来不把他自己的工作看做是脱离人民大众的孤立的事情，他总是根据人民的利益来估量自己的工作，因此他的工作中表现着高度的政治性。鲁迅不把文艺工作看做小资产阶级的个人才能的表现，而看做是严肃的政治事业。——这点，不仅文艺工作者应该学习，一切做文化思想工作的同志都应该学习。
    我们也应该学习鲁迅的实事求是的作风。
    鲁迅的坚强的政治性是和他的实事求是的作风分不开来的。鲁迅的著作中有很多的篇幅，用来批评旧社会中的虚伪矫饰、自欺欺人、言行不一的作风；这是封建统治阶级的作风，是半殖民地社会中买办的作风，是恬不知耻的官僚的作风，是伪君子的“名流”的作风。鲁迅极端痛恨这种作风。他做了很大的斗争来教育人民不要沾染这种作风。鲁迅自己在工作中是极端认真踏实的，凡他认为应该做的事，他就一定要认真做到，并且一定要做好，绝不摆出一个空架子来，而实际上一无所有。
    小资产阶级的革命者往往缺少这种实事求是的作风。共产主义者的鲁迅曾经从这个方面对于小资产阶级革命者提出了严格的、正确的批评。不切切实地工作而徒尚空谈的作风是鲁迅所不能容忍的。
    实事求是的作风是马克思列宁主义的作风，是毛泽东同志的作风。这种作风是很可贵的。现在的文化文艺工作中也还有只图表面热闹，不做切切实实的工作，不追究工作的实际效果的现象，所以我们都应该很好地向鲁迅学习。
    我们也应该学习鲁迅的战斗精神，要像鲁迅同样地正确而勇敢地进行思想斗争。
    就因为鲁迅具有坚定的政治立场和实事求是的作风，所以他才能够在思想战线上做了极其重要的工作，他的成就对于中国人民和中国革命事业是有不朽的价值的。
    鲁迅是一个在思想战线上的顽强的战士。“鲁迅的骨头是最硬的。”他在国民党统治区域内，向帝国主义、买办、法西斯统治者和他们的一切大小走狗进行短兵相接的尖锐斗争。不论他们提出什么冠冕堂皇的名目，鲁迅总是毫不容情地加以揭穿，使人民清清楚楚地看到他们的丑恶的凶残的本来面目。当鲁迅这样做的时候，很显然的，他是并没有一点可以保障自己的安全的凭借的。
    鲁迅所进行的思想斗争都是出发于坚定的立场，是有原则的。他在攻击当面的敌人的时候，的确做到了寸步不让，即使对方已经成了“落水狗”，也决不松劲。他也批评朋友，对朋友的批评和对敌人的攻击，在鲁迅有显然的区别。对于那些曾经混在革命内又从革命“爬”出去的角色，鲁迅的鞭挞是不容情的；而对于他所曾经批评过的革命战线上的朋友，他还是在政治原则下号召合作，共同进行对敌的斗争。但是如果说，既然是朋友，即使有错误或缺点，也应该互相包涵，这种说法，是鲁迅绝对不承认的。
    斯大林同志曾经批评那种“用家庭式的和家务式的方法来解决问题”的恶劣作风。斯大林说：“如果我们无产阶级革命的代表者，闭眼不看我们的缺点，用家庭式的方法来解决问题，互相遮盖自己的错误，把病毒赶到我们党的机体内部去，——那末究竟谁来改正这些错误，这些缺点呢？”斯大林同志在这里说的是共产党内的批评的问题。在革命的文化工作者，文艺工作者中也绝对不容许用家庭式的方法来处理问题，掩盖错误。鲁迅的勇于批评和自我批评的精神是我们的模范。通过批评和自我批评，我们才能取得思想原则上的一致，从而才能取得巩固的团结。
    在我们现在的文化文艺工作中十分需要鲁迅式的战斗精神。决不和反动的思想和平共居，决不无原则地宽容错误的思想，不论这种错误思想是在自己的身上还是在别人的身上。这种精神是我们在任何时候必须具备的。
    我们还必须学习鲁迅不断地通过学习和斗争来改造自己，追求真理的精神。
    鲁迅从旧民主主义革命中的彻底的民主主义者，进步发展到新民主主义革命中的共产主义者，在他的思想发展过程中，并不是平平稳稳，一直向前的。这中间，也必然地是曾经经过严格的自我批评和激烈的思想斗争的。鲁迅对他自己的缺点，也像对于朋友的缺点一样，是毫不宽容的。知识分子常常易于自欺和自满，而鲁迅却是敢于把自己的思想中的旧的成分揭发出来的人；是敢于用新的思想来征服自己的旧的思想的人。就这方面说，鲁迅可以做一切在自我改造的过程中的知识分子的模范。
    鲁迅在成为共产主义者以前，他的思想曾有一些成分是和马克思主义不相容的。鲁迅一面进行工作和斗争，一面认真地研读当时他所能得到的马克思主义的书籍。当他一旦发觉真理是在这里的时候，他就毫不姑息地抛弃旧的思想，坚定地站在新的立场上来。
    近两年来，全国的文艺工作者、科学工作者、文化教育工作者，都普遍地进行了马克思列宁主义的学习。文化思想工作有很大的进步。自武训传的讨论展开后，思想批评的工作也活跃起来了。这些都是好的现象，但是，我们在思想战线上的工作还有很大的缺点。“武训传”的电影的出现，就已说明，做文化工作的有些共产党员同志也还不能敏锐地区别资产阶级反动思想和无产阶级思想，还不能用应有的严肃的政治态度来处理一切思想性的工作。我们的学校教育现在还没有按照新民主主义国家的需要进行彻底的改造。在各种文化文艺工作中还没有充分展开必要的和正确的思想批评，许多地方还表现着资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想倾向，甚至还出现带有破坏性的反动思想。我们的科学研究工作——包括社会科学和自然科学，也还比较薄弱，不能和每天在发展进步着的国家生活和社会生活的要求相适应。对于中国的社会历史，特别需要用马克思主义的原理和方法来进行深入的研究，并批评各种错误的意见，这方面的工作我们做的还太少。
    因此，我们一定要大大地改进和加强各个部门的文化思想工作。新中国的文艺工作者，科学工作者，教育工作者和其他一切思想工作者，更认真地来进行学习和自我改造，力求提高自己的马克思主义的思想水平，这正是改进和加强文化思想工作的基本关键。
    以中国人民的革命文化的伟大的先驱者——鲁迅为楷模，新中国的知识分子和文化工作者应该更勇敢地、更奋勉地为改造和提高自己而努力。我们一定要使自己的工作更好地、更有效地服务于人民，服务于国家，服务于伟大的中国革命事业。
