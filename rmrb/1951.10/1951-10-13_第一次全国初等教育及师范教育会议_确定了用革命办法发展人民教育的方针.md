Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The First National Conference on Elementary Education and Teacher Education, convened by the Central People's Government in September, discussed the current situation of elementary and teacher education and decided on the future development direction.
    The meeting pointed out: The current situation of elementary education in the country is as follows: With the gradual completion of land reform and the gradual recovery of industry and agriculture, the working people of industry and agriculture throughout the country urgently demand that their children be sent to school. Elementary education in various places, especially in the old liberated areas, has developed rapidly. The number of children enrolled in school is more than 37 million, exceeding the highest pre-war level by 55 percent. However, this development still cannot meet the needs of the broad masses of the people. People's representatives' conferences in various provinces and cities have successively proposed motions to increase the number of elementary schools and complete elementary schools. The four-year and two-year segmented system of elementary schools hinders the children of the broad working people from enjoying complete elementary education. The curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching methods of many elementary schools are still very chaotic and of poor quality. At the same time, the funding for elementary education is still difficult, the treatment of rural elementary school teachers is too low, and elementary school education in some areas is still very unstable. The situation of teacher education is that the number of students graduating from teacher training schools at all levels is far less than the needs of various places for primary and secondary school teachers; the direction and tasks of teacher education are not clear, and the settings are mostly unreasonable. At the same time, because the treatment of primary and secondary school teachers is generally relatively low, teacher training schools at all levels have encountered many difficulties in enrollment.
    During the sixteen days of the meeting, the focus was on discussing the direction and tasks of elementary and teacher education in New China, effectively solving the local education funds of cities and counties, appropriately improving the treatment of elementary school teachers, training a large number of primary and secondary education teachers in a short period of time, and strengthening the on-the-job learning of primary and secondary school teachers. The meeting recognized that to consolidate and develop elementary and teacher education in New China, it is necessary to handle affairs with a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods, and oppose the traditional and conservative old methods that do not conform to the actual situation of the country; it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of Marxism-Leninism in education work, resolutely eliminate comprador and feudal ideas in education work, and at the same time, start to criticize various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois erroneous ideas.
    The meeting believed that education in New China must resolutely serve the political and economic undertakings of the people. The content (first and foremost the curriculum) and methods of the old education must be resolutely reformed. Schools must truly be open to workers, peasants, and soldiers. Expenditure should be as economical as possible, and extravagance and waste should be opposed. Educators in New China must resolutely face the masses, rely on the masses, and constantly engage in self-criticism to improve their work. The meeting also believed that to run people's education well, there must also be a system that is completely suitable for the current national situation and needs. The "Decision on Reforming the School System" passed by the Government Administration Council in August of this year is an important revolutionary step in China's education work, which will ensure that the children of the broad working people receive complete elementary education and make worker-peasant spare-time education and various technical education occupy an important position in national education construction.
    The meeting believed that the planned and step-by-step popularization of children's elementary education is already a realistic task for educators in New China, and it is also a great and historically significant project. At present, the number of school-age children enrolled in school nationwide (excluding over-age and under-age children) is only 46 percent of all school-age children. Before 1957, elementary education in New China should strive to enroll 80 percent of school-age children nationwide. Within six years, the four regions of Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South should strive to enroll 85 to 90 percent of school-age children, and the Northwest and Southwest should strive to enroll 65 to 70 percent of school-age children. At the same time as starting to implement the popularization of children's elementary education, the original six-year segmented elementary schools should be changed to five-year continuous elementary schools within five years.
    The meeting discussed the issue of raising the treatment of elementary school teachers. The meeting believed that being a people's teacher is a glorious profession, and their treatment should be continuously improved with the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives. The changes in the situation in some areas of Northeast and North China in recent years have shown a beginning, and the situation of Soviet teachers is also a bright prospect for Chinese people's teachers. The average monthly salary of rural elementary school teachers in various places should not be less than 200 catties of rice or wheat; the people of the whole country should respect the people's teachers, and governments at all levels should take various measures to improve the political treatment and social status of teachers. All elementary school teachers must also work hard to study, continuously improve their political and ideological level and work ability, closely contact the masses, serve the people wholeheartedly, and cultivate a professional spirit that is consolidated and dedicated to the people's education cause. The bad ideas and bad work styles of some teachers who are divorced from the masses and even look down on the masses must be thoroughly changed. In order to effectively solve the local education funds of cities and counties, the meeting suggested that the provincial and municipal governments should clearly stipulate the expenditure items and expenditure ratios of local surtax grain; implement the method of county-level overall planning, special commissioner office and provincial adjustment and subsidy for local education funds, and at the same time mobilize the masses to contribute money and labor to run schools, and in cities rely on industrial and mining enterprises to run schools.
    The meeting estimated the needs of educational development in various places. Between 1952 and 1957, the country will be short of at least 1 million elementary school teachers, 200,000 worker-peasant education teachers, 130,000 secondary school teachers, and tens of thousands of kindergarten teachers. Solving the problem of teachers is the key to all educational work in the future. Education leading departments at all levels should firmly grasp this central link and go all out, otherwise the national education work will suffer major losses. The meeting believed that the methods of training teachers for secondary and elementary education are, on the one hand, adjusting, rectifying, and developing teacher training schools at all levels; on the other hand, in order to adapt to the large and urgent needs, the work of training teachers in the next three to five years should focus on various short-term training. One way to train teachers in a short period of time is to absorb and mobilize unemployed intellectuals and housewives in urban and rural areas as much as possible for training, and the other is to select excellent teachers from existing schools at all levels for training and promote them level by level. The curriculum of various short-term teacher training classes should be suitable for the target audience, be practical, and pay attention to being concise and precise. Generally, emphasis should be placed on the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and professional education. Students in various short-term teacher training classes should generally enjoy public funding. Teachers on the job who are transferred for training should be treated according to their original salary.
    The meeting believed that the national education work has made significant achievements in political and ideological education in the past two years. However, the bureaucratic work style and weak ideological and political nature in the work of education administrative departments at all levels, and the ideological confusion among some school teachers in certain areas, must be resolutely overcome. The meeting suggested that education administrative departments at all levels should conduct universal inspections to strengthen political and ideological leadership. Local on-the-job primary and secondary school teachers should have regular political study. Correctly carrying out the ideological struggle on the education front is also an important task of education work in New China.
    The meeting discussed and passed the draft of eight documents, including the "Provisional Regulations for Elementary Schools," "Provisional Regulations for Kindergartens," "Provisional Regulations for Teacher Training Schools," "Regulations on Higher Normal Schools," "Decision on Effectively Solving the Local Education Funds of Counties and Cities," "Instructions on Appropriately Improving the Treatment of Elementary School Teachers," "Decision on Training a Large Number of Primary and Secondary Education Teachers in a Short Period of Time," and "Instructions on Strengthening the On-the-Job Learning of Primary and Secondary School Teachers." The meeting also exchanged views on documents such as the Elementary School Teacher Service Regulations, Kindergarten Staff Service Regulations, Measures for Rewarding Excellent Elementary School Teachers, Curriculum Standards for Elementary School Subjects, Kindergarten Teaching Outline, Principles for Adjusting and Setting Up Higher Normal Schools, Teacher Training School Setting Plan, Curriculum Outline for Education, and the implementation steps of the new school system. These documents will be reviewed and promulgated by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government for implementation or submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation for implementation.
    The meeting especially commended the rural elementary school teachers in various places who used revolutionary methods, contacted the masses, overcame various difficulties, and ran schools well, and the elementary school teachers who painstakingly studied, invented, created, and improved their work. Shi Ruifen, the principal of Qingshuitang Elementary School in Liyang, Southern Jiangsu District, Song Bing, the principal of Hejiatang Elementary School in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and Zhang Junde of Xi'an Normal Affiliated Elementary School, who created the three-sphere instrument, were all commended and warmly welcomed by the meeting.

    第一次全国初等教育及师范教育会议
    确定了用革命办法发展人民教育的方针
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府在九月间召集的第一次全国初等教育及师范教育会议，讨论了初等教育和师范教育的现状，并决定了今后的发展方针。
    会议指出：目前全国初等教育的情况是：随着土地改革的逐步完成，工农业的逐步恢复，全国工、农劳动人民迫切要求送子女入学，各地尤其是老解放区的初等教育有了飞跃的发展，入学儿童有三千七百余万，已超过战前最高水平的百分之五十五。但这种发展还不能满足广大人民的需要。各省市人民代表会议纷纷提出增办小学和完全小学的提案。小学四年和二年的分段制妨害了广大劳动人民子女享受完全的初等教育。许多小学的课程、教材、教法还很混乱，质量也很差。同时目前初等教育的经费还困难，农村小学待遇过低，某些地区的小学教育还很不稳定。师范教育的情况是：各级师范学校毕业的学生数远不及各地对中、小学师资的需要；师范教育的方针任务不明确，设置也多不合理。同时因中、小学教师待遇一般比较低，因此各级师范学校招生发生了很多困难。
    会议在十六天中，着重讨论了新中国初等教育及师范教育的方针任务，切实解决市、县地方教育经费，适当改善小学教师待遇，大量短期培养初等及中等教育师资，加强中、小学教师在职学习等问题。会议认定：要巩固和发展新中国的初等教育和师范教育，必须以革命精神用革命办法办事，反对与国家实际不相符合的传统的和保守的旧办法；必须在教育工作中加强马克思列宁主义的领导，坚决肃清教育工作中的买办思想和封建思想，同时要着手批判各种资产阶级、小资产阶级的错误思想。
    会议认为新中国的教育必须坚决为人民的政治、经济事业服务。旧教育的内容（首先是课程）和方法必须坚决改革。学校要真正作到为工农兵开门。经费开支要力求节省，反对铺张浪费。新中国的教育工作者必须坚决面向群众、依靠群众，不断进行自我批评，以改进工作。会议并认为要办好人民教育，还必须有完全适合于当前国家情况与需要的制度。政务院今年八月通过的“关于改革学制的决定”，是中国教育工作中的一个重要的革命步骤，它将保证广大劳动人民的子女受到完全的初等教育，并使工农补习教育和各种技术教育在国家教育建设中占重要的地位。
    会议认为有计划、有步骤地普及儿童初等教育已是新中国教育工作者的现实任务，也是具有伟大历史意义的艰巨工程。目前全国入学的学龄儿童（超龄和不及学龄的儿童除外）仅及全部学龄儿童的百分之四十六。新中国初等教育应在一九五七年以前争取全国学龄儿童百分之八十入学。六年之内，东北、华北、华东、中南四个地区应争取百分之八十五到九十的学龄儿童入学，西北和西南应争取百分之六十五至七十的学龄儿童入学。与开始实行普及儿童初等教育同时，原有六年分段制的小学应当在五年内一律改为五年一贯制的小学。
    会议讨论了提高小学教师待遇问题。会议认为：作人民教师是一种光荣的职业，其待遇应随国家经济的发展、人民生活的改善得到不断的提高。东北和华北若干地区年来情况的改变已显示了一个开端，苏联教师的情况也是中国人民教师的光明的远景。各地乡村小学教师每月平均工资应当不少于二百斤米或麦；全国人民应尊敬人民教师，各级人民政府应采取各种办法提高教师的政治待遇和社会地位。全体小学教师也必须努力学习，不断提高自己的政治思想水平和工作能力，密切联系群众，全心全意为人民群众服务，培养巩固地为人民教育事业服务的专业精神。部分教师的脱离群众甚至瞧不起群众的坏思想坏作风，必须彻底加以改变。为切实解决市县地方教育经费，会议建议各省、市政府应明确规定地方附加粮的开支科目与开支比例；对地方教育经费实行由县统筹，专署和省调剂补助的办法，同时发动群众出钱出力办学，在城市则依靠工矿机关办学。
    会议估计了各地教育事业发展的需要，在一九五二年至一九五七年间，全国至少缺少小学教师一百万人，工农教育教师二十万人，中等学校教师十三万人，幼儿教育教师数万人。解决师资问题是今后全部教育工作的关键，各级教育领导部门应该牢牢抓紧这一中心环节，全力进行，否则全国教育工作就会遭受重大损失。会议认为：培养中等和初等教育师资的方法，一方面是调整、整顿和发展各级师范学校；另一方面为了适应大量和急迫的需要，今后三、五年内培养师资的工作应以多种多样的短期训练为重点。短期培养师资的办法，一个是尽一切可能吸收和动员城乡失业知识分子和家庭知识妇女加以训练，另一个是从现有各级学校教师中，选择其优秀者加以训练，逐级提升。各种短期师资训练班的课程应适合对象，切合实际，注意少而精。一般都应着重马列主义和毛泽东思想的教育和业务教育。各种短期师资训练班的学生一般应享受公费制的待遇。在职教师经调训者应按原来工薪待遇。
    会议认为两年来全国教育工作在政治思想教育方面已经有了显著的成绩。但各级教育行政部门工作中的事务主义作风及思想性政治性贫弱，和某些地区的部分学校教师中思想混乱的情况，则必须坚决地加以克服。会议建议各级教育行政部门应普遍进行检查以加强政治思想领导。各地在职中、小学教师应有经常的政治学习。正确地开展教育战线上的思想斗争，也是新中国教育工作的重要任务。
    会议讨论通过了“小学暂行规程”、“幼儿园暂行规程”、“师范学校暂行规程”、“关于高等师范学校的规定”、“关于切实解决县、市地方教育经费的决定”、“关于适当改善小学教师待遇的指示”、“关于大量短期培养初等及中等教育师资的决定”、“加强中、小学教师在职学习的指示”等八个文件的草案。会议并就小学教师服务规程、幼儿园工作人员服务规程、奖励优良小学教师办法、小学各科课程标准、幼儿园教学纲要、高等师范学校调整设置原则、师范学校设置计划、教育学课程纲要等文件和新学制实施步骤问题交换了意见。这些文件均将由中央人民政府教育部加以审订公布施行或提请政务院核准颁布实施。
    会议特别表扬了各地用革命办法，联系群众，克服各种困难，办好学校的农村小学教师，和苦心钻研，发明创造，改进业务的小学教师。到会的苏南区溧阳清水塘小学校长史瑞芬、浙江省杭州贺家塘小学校长宋冰，和创造三球仪的西安师范附小张俊德等，都受到会议的表扬和热烈的欢迎。
