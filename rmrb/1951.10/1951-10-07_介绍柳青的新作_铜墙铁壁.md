Introducing Liu Qing's New Work "Bronze Walls and Iron Bastions"
    Xue Yuan
    "Bronze Walls and Iron Bastions" by Liu Qing, published by People's Literature Publishing House.

    "Bronze Walls and Iron Bastions" by Liu Qing, author of "Record of Planting Grain," has recently been completed. The subject matter of this novel is as follows: During the People's Liberation War, after the Jiang-Hu bandit gang occupied Yan'an, the people of northern Shaanxi, under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao, persisted in the struggle against the Kuomintang bandit army, and finally completely annihilated Hu Zongnan's main force, the Thirty-sixth Reorganized Division, reversing the war situation on the Northwest battlefield. This is a great theme of historical significance. In this campaign, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai of the People's Liberation Army ordered: "...The annihilation of the Thirty-sixth Division is the beginning of the Northwest battlefield's transition from strategic defense to strategic counter-offensive, and the beginning of the recovery of Yan'an and the liberation of the Great Northwest..." This novel attempts to show how the Party, government, army, and people united as one in this campaign, contributed the greatest strength, and achieved victory in the war.

    The novel depicts the great contribution of the people to the war. The author clearly tells us: The victory of the Liberation War depended on the unity of the people throughout the country. There was heroic fighting at the front, and great support at the rear. The glory of victory belongs to all the people. The author uses the work of the Shajiadian grain station as the center of the story. This was a temporary grain station set up to supply grain to the People's Liberation Army's troops attacking Yulin. The Shajiadian village cadres in charge of the work of this grain station persisted in the work of the grain station when the situation was very critical. Because they understood that "grain is victory, grain is the lives of the soldiers," they did not give up the grain rush even when the enemy was about to enter Shajiadian. The masses of the people also deeply understood the impact of the victory or defeat of the war on themselves, and they had to put out all their strength, so the laborers braved the enemy's bombing and strafing, and constantly carried grain to the front with their shoulders and backs. The scene described in the book is very moving, let us look at the author's description of the enthusiastic situation of the masses transferring the wounded soldiers across the Yellow River:

    "Because most of the young and strong men in Natta went out to work as laborers, the main road to the ferry and the villages on both sides, men and women from their teens to their forties, were mobilized when they heard the cadres call. People sent them village by village, even women with bound feet lifted stretchers, and strong men carried them one by one on their backs. The masses put forward the slogan: Don't let a wounded soldier stay on the west bank of the river!..."

    Wherever our troops went, the masses greeted them with unparalleled enthusiasm, and the women rushed to boil water and send apples to the troops. The author reflects the strength of the Chinese people through these many facts, which is an important aspect of this novel's correct reflection of reality.

    The novel also depicts the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the image of Communist Party cadres. The image of Commissioner Ge in the novel is relatively successfully handled. Here we see a very experienced and strategically minded middle-level cadre. He understands the nature of the war very well, has considerable theoretical knowledge and rich combat experience, and he believes in the strength of the masses. He said: "All revolutionary work, including the grain station, is done by Party members leading the masses, and cannot be done by Party members and cadres alone."

    The author also describes the leadership of district cadres, and puts forward a leadership idea -- the struggle against subjectivism and narrow empiricism. Jin Shuwang, the secretary of the district party committee, is a relatively politically visionary person, but because he has only been transferred to work for a short time, he is not very familiar with the situation of the cadres, and he does not dare to make a judgment on a certain cadre immediately. Cao Anben, the head of the district, is of good quality, but he is also somewhat subjective and accustomed to using empirical methods to look at problems. Therefore, the two had different views on the issue of establishing the Shajiadian grain station. Jin Shuwang's opinion was to hand over the grain station to the Shajiadian village cadres, and free up the district cadres to lead the war preparation work in various townships, so that the work could be fully developed. Cao, the head of the district, advocated putting the district cadres in the grain station, and he did not believe in the strength of the village cadres. In this debate, Jin Shuwang's opinion was basically correct. However, after deciding to hand over the grain station to the village cadres, Cao, the head of the district, did not believe in the resolute, brave, loyal and reliable young Party member Shi Defu. He said that Shi Defu was "a callow youth, and his words were unreliable." Instead, he believed in Shi Yonggong (also a Party member), who was not active in his work, timid, and only good at using pens, inkstones and abacuses. Facts proved that Cao's view was wrong. The author faced up to the problems existing in the leadership's thinking, carefully analyzed the complex relationship between the leading cadres, and truthfully described the process of change from disagreement to unity in the cadres' thinking.

    The entire story content of this novel, and the theme it wants to express, are of course not only these. After reading this novel, what we understand is definitely not just the story of this grain station, and the great war scene that is set off behind it. If we can deeply appreciate it, we can get a higher idea from this novel: the entire content of this novel is to embody the great victory of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. The brilliance of Chairman Mao's thought shines on this victory. With Chairman Mao, the people have courage and strength. When the war was very critical, our cadres and the masses thought like this:

    "Chairman Mao will not abandon us! There are difficulties, but Chairman Mao is leading us, and we must win!" The people believe in Chairman Mao, and the people are willing to unite around Chairman Mao and contribute everything they have. This irresistible great force armed with Mao Zedong Thought is an indestructible "bronze wall and iron bastion."

    The author portrayed the image of Chairman Mao in this novel, although the space used is very small, but this has already given us great excitement. The success of the author in depicting the image of Chairman Mao is that he combined the image of Chairman Mao with the will of the people. The image of the great leader is clustered out of the masses. The author introduced Chairman Mao's appearance in the sound of the masses' surprised and mixed voices:

    "Chairman Mao is coming. The masses on the river beach opened a large alley, but Chairman Mao did not walk fast. He did not ride his iron-gray horse, and all the livestock followed a little further behind. He walked between Comrades Zhou Enlai and Ren Bishi, with his unique kind smile, and with his sage's piercing eyes, he looked excitedly at the simple faces of the endless peasant masses on both sides; their strength reliably supported the victory of the Liberation Army."

    The author specially described Chairman Mao's concern for the masses, and also described how the masses admired and loved their leader. This description is genuine. But if we demand a higher standard, this description of Chairman Mao is still not enough to satisfy us, because in this passage, the author can only do a description of Chairman Mao's posture and appearance, and cannot describe more of the part that can embody Chairman Mao's thought. How to powerfully and deeply depict the image of the people's leader may not be possible in a novel, but this does reflect an urgent desire of the broad masses of readers, and we hope that this urgent desire of the broad masses of readers can be satisfied.

    Shaping the image of the leader is a glorious and great task for our writers. This task cannot be accomplished simply by relying on descriptive techniques. If we cannot truly understand Mao Zedong Thought and the practice of the Chinese revolution, we will never be able to do this work. Therefore, we hope that our authors will study Chairman Mao's thought, study the practice of the Chinese revolution led by Chairman Mao, and study the historical development of the Party. This is the most basic condition for shaping the image of Chairman Mao.

    介绍柳青的新作“铜墙铁壁”
    雪原
    “铜墙铁壁”柳青著人民文学出版社出版
    “种谷记”的作者柳青同志，最近完成了他的另一部长篇小说“铜墙铁壁”。这部小说的取材是这样的：人民解放战争期间，蒋胡匪帮侵占延安以后，陕北人民，在毛主席的直接领导下，和国民党匪军坚持斗争，终于全部歼灭胡宗南的主力整编第三十六师，转变了西北战场战争局势。这是一个具有历史意义的伟大题材。在这次战役中，人民解放军彭德怀副总司令命令说：“……消灭三十六师是西北战场由战略防御转为战略反攻的开始是收复延安、解放大西北的开始……”这部小说就是企图表现在这个战役中，党、政、军、民怎样团结一致，贡献了最大的力量，取得了战争的胜利。
    小说中描写了人民群众对于战争的伟大贡献。作者清楚地告诉了我们：解放战争的胜利是依靠全国人民的团结一致，有前方英勇的战斗，还要有后方伟大的支援。胜利的光荣，是属于人民全体的。作者以沙家店粮站的工作作为故事的中心。这是为供给人民解放军进攻榆林部队粮食而设立的一个临时粮站。掌握这个粮站工作的沙家店村干部，在情况十分危急的时候坚持了粮站工作。因为他们懂得，
    “粮食就是胜利，粮食就是战士们的性命”，因此当敌人快要进入沙家店时，他们还不放弃粮食抢运工作。人民群众也深深懂得战争的胜利或失败对于他们自身的影响，他们必须拿出一切力量来，所以民工们不顾敌人飞机的轰炸扫射，不断用肩和背把粮食运到前方。书中所描写的情景是很动人的，让我们再看作者所写的群众转移伤兵过黄河的热烈情况吧：
    “那塔因为年轻力壮的男子汉大部分出去当民工了，通渡口的大路上和两旁的村子，从十几岁到四十岁的男女一听见干部号召，都动员起来了。人家一村一村送，连小脚婆姨都抬起担架，有气力的男子汉竟然一人一个地背。群众提出口号：不让有一个伤兵留在河西过不去！……”
    凡是我们部队走到的地方，群众都以无比的热情慰问招待，妇女赶忙给部队烧水，送苹果。作者通过这许多事实反映了中国人民的力量，这是这部小说正确地反映了现实中的重要的一面。
    小说中也描写了中国共产党的领导同共产党员干部的形象。小说中的葛专员的形象是处理得比较成功的，这里我们看见了一个很老练，富有策略思想的中级干部。他非常理解战争的性质，有相当的理论修养和丰富的斗争经验，他相信群众的力量，他说：“一切革命工作，包括粮站在内，都是党员领导群众做，而不能只靠党员和干部做。”
    作者也描写了区干部的领导，提出了一个领导思想——反对主观主义和狭隘经验主义的斗争。区委书记金树旺是一个比较有政治远见的人物，但是因为他调来工作的时间很短，干部情况还不太熟悉，对于某一干部不敢马上下判断。区长曹安本品质上还好，但也有些主观，惯用经验主义的方法看问题。因此两个人在建立沙家店粮站的问题上，有了不同的见解。金树旺的意见是把粮站交给沙家店村干部去搞，腾出区干部来领导各乡的备战工作，这样可以使工作全面展开。而曹区长则主张把区干部放在粮站上，他不相信村干部的力量。在这个争论中，金树旺的意见基本上是正确的。可是在决定把粮站交给村干部以后，曹区长又不相信坚决、勇敢、忠实、可靠的青年党员石得富。他说石得富“嘴上没毛，说话不牢”。反而相信一个工作不积极，胆小怕事，只是笔砚算盘还能动一下的石永公（也是党员）。事实证明了曹区长的看法又是错误的。作者正视了领导思想上所存在的问题，细致地分析了领导干部间的复杂的关系，真实地描写了干部思想由分歧而走向统一的变化过程。
    这部小说的全部故事内容，和它所要表达的主题思想，当然不仅是这些。当我们读了这部小说之后，所领会到的，也决不只是这个粮站的故事，以及其背后所衬托的伟大的战争场景。如果我们能够深刻地体味一下，是可以从这部小说里，获得一个更高的思想：这部小说全部的内容就是体现毛主席战略思想的伟大胜利。毛主席的思想的光辉照耀着这个胜利。有了毛主席，人民就有勇气和力量。当战争十分危急的时候，我们的干部和群众这样想：
    “毛主席不会丢开我们！困难是有的，可是毛主席领导着我们，一定要胜利！”人民相信毛主席，人民愿意团结在毛主席周围，贡献自己的一切。这个由毛主席思想武装起来的不可遏止的伟大力量，就是一道不可摧毁的“铜墙铁壁”。
    作者在这部小说中描绘了毛主席的形象，虽然用的篇幅很小，但是这已经给了我们很大的兴奋。作者描写毛主席形象的成功之处，就是他把毛主席形象和人民的意志结合在一起了。伟大的领袖形象，是从群众中簇拥出来的。作者在群众惊喜交加的声浪中，介绍了毛主席的出场：
    “毛主席过来了。河滩上群众让开一条大巷，可是毛主席并不快走。他不骑他的铁青马，所有的牲口都跟在稍远点的后边，他在周恩来和任弼时同志中间走着，带着他特有的慈祥的笑容，用他那圣哲的炯炯目光，兴奋地望着两边一片无边的农民群众的淳朴的脸庞；是他们的力量可靠地支持了解放军的胜利。”
    作者特别描写了毛主席对群众的关心，还描写了群众如何敬仰和爱戴自己的领袖，这种描写是真切的。但如果按更高的标准来要求的话，这样对毛主席的描写是还不能令我们感到满足的，因为在这段描写中，作者主要还只能做到描写毛主席的姿态容貌，而不能更多地描写足以体现毛主席思想的部分。如何有力地深刻地描写人民领袖的形象，也许不是一部小说所能办到的，但这里的确反映了广大读者的一个迫切愿望，我们希望广大读者的这个迫切愿望能够得到满足。
    塑造领袖形象，是我们创作家的一个光荣而伟大的任务。这个任务决不是单纯依靠描写技巧所能完成的。如果不能做到真正领会毛泽东思想同中国革命的实际，是决不能胜任这个工作的。因此，希望我们的作者要研究毛主席思想，研究由毛主席所领导的中国革命的实践，研究党的历史发展。这是塑造毛主席形象的最基本条件。
