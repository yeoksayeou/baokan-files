Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 29th: The Mongolian newspaper "Truth" published the following statement by Lhamsuren, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic, regarding the unilateral peace treaty with Japan:

The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic has authorized me to make the following statement regarding the so-called "peace treaty" concluded between the U.S. government and its vassal states with Japan:

(1) The so-called "peace treaty" signed in San Francisco on September 8 this year is not a common treaty, but merely a separate peace treaty with Japan manufactured by the U.S. government.

At the San Francisco conference, the "majority" of countries, under U.S. pressure, obeyed the United States, and through special U.S. arrangements, shamelessly rejected the just proposals regarding the peace treaty with Japan put forward by the Soviet Union and supported by representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia; and, without discussion, obsequiously signed and sealed the U.S.-British-made peace treaty with Japan. However, the majority of countries that signed this illegal document did not actually participate in the war against Japan, nor are they Asian countries.

The Soviet Union, which played a decisive role in defeating imperialist Japan, resolutely rejected this illegal peace treaty with Japan unilaterally manufactured by the U.S. and British ruling groups, considering it a criminal act directly preparing for war.

The main country in Asia, first and foremost the People's Republic of China, did not participate in the San Francisco conference. The people of the People's Republic of China suffered the greatest losses from Japanese aggression and played a huge role in eliminating Japanese imperialism. The troops of the Mongolian People's Republic directly participated in the war against Japan and did their best to contribute to the cause of defeating Japanese imperialism. However, it was illegally refused to participate in the preparation and signing of the peace treaty with Japan.

Therefore, the "peace treaty" with Japan, authorized by the United States and not signed by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other Asian countries that made direct contributions to the victory over imperialist Japan, cannot and does not conform to the interests of Asian countries. Therefore, it cannot be accepted by the people of these countries.

The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic expresses the unanimous will of all the Mongolian people, considering the "peace treaty" with Japan manufactured by the U.S. government to be illegal and without legal effect. Therefore, it resolutely protests this "peace treaty" with Japan.

(2) The separate peace treaty with Japan seriously violates international agreements regarding the peace settlement with Japan.

As everyone knows, the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, and the decisions adopted by the Far Eastern Commission based on this proclamation, stipulated that Japanese militarism must be purged and Japan must be democratized. However, the U.S.-British separate "peace treaty" with Japan does not contain any guarantees to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism. On the contrary, the U.S.-Japan bilateral "Security Treaty," signed on the same day as this document, stipulates the extension of the U.S. military occupation of Japan and opens the way for the revival of Japanese militarism.

The U.S. government has perfidiously violated its obligations, infringing on the undeniable rights of the People's Republic of China to Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and other islands, which have always been Chinese territory. The drafters of the separate peace treaty with Japan even illegally separated the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, Iwo Jima, Nishinoshima, and other islands from Japan, actually giving them to the United States. The division of these islands is not stipulated in any international agreement. The main task of the U.S.-British separate treaty is to strengthen the dependence of the Japanese economy on the United States, disregarding the necessity of not restricting Japan's peaceful industries. At the same time, it provides unlimited opportunities for the restoration and development of Japanese war industries.

Therefore, the peace treaty with Japan signed in San Francisco has nothing to do with the Far Eastern peace settlement stipulated by the international agreements, but only helps the U.S. imperialists in their ongoing scheme to launch and expand war, and undermines peace and security in the Far East and the world. The clear and concrete amendments and supplements to the U.S.-made draft peace treaty with Japan proposed by the Soviet delegation at the San Francisco conference have received the heartfelt support of the people of all Asian countries, including our Mongolian people.

The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic also declares that only by accepting the Soviet Union's just proposals regarding the peace treaty with Japan, which aim to ensure peace and security in the Far East and the world, can it serve as the basis for a true peace settlement with Japan in accordance with the spirit of international agreements, and conform to the will and expectations of the people of those countries that have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression.

(3) The illegal separate peace treaty with Japan aims to revive Japanese militarism and drag Japan into new adventures against the peace-loving people of Asian countries, especially against the people of the Soviet Union, China, and Korea. However, history has proven that the aggression of Japanese militarists against any country in Asia will always directly threaten all other countries in Asia, including Mongolia.

The most dangerous long-time enemy of the Mongolian people, the Japanese imperialists, began to implement their insatiable plans for Mongolia soon after occupying Korea in 1909. In 1919, they established in Chita the so-called "Great Mongolian Government" headed by Neise Gegu, a living Buddha who sold himself to Japanese imperialism. The task of this government was to unite all the tribes of Mongolia and place them under Japanese protection.

In order to make Mongolia a springboard for anti-Soviet war, Japanese militarists transferred to Mongolia in the following year the White Guard bandits led by the bloody Baron Ungern, whom they had hired. After Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931, the danger of its aggression against Mongolia became particularly serious and direct. From then until 1945, our country was constantly under the threat of Japanese aggression. During this period, they repeatedly launched armed attacks on our country, infringing on the freedom and independence of our Mongolian people, causing huge losses to the Mongolian People's Republic in manpower and materials.

Now, U.S. imperialists are formulating their evil plans against the peace-loving people of all countries. They are reviving Japanese militarism and openly using Japanese reserves of materials and manpower to carry out their armed adventures in Korea and China. The Mongolian people cannot stand idly by while preparing to repeat Japan's aggression against Asian countries, including our own.

The Mongolian people are deeply concerned about a true peace settlement with Japan and the prevention of the revival of Japanese imperialism, and they resolutely protest the treaty of preparing for war and aggression concluded in San Francisco.

Together with the Soviet Union, Asian countries, and all peace-loving people in the world, the Mongolian people are fully determined to prevent the danger of expanding war in the Far East arising from the separate peace treaty with Japan, and to spare no effort to smash the conspiracy of the drafters of this illegal document - the U.S. and British instigators of new wars.

### 蒙古人民共和国外长拉姆苏伦发表声明  抗议美制非法的单独对日和约  蒙古人民决心保卫和平以粉碎美英扩大侵略远东阴谋

    蒙古人民共和国外长拉姆苏伦发表声明
    抗议美制非法的单独对日和约
    蒙古人民决心保卫和平以粉碎美英扩大侵略远东阴谋
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社乌兰巴托二十七日电：蒙古《真理报》发表蒙古人民共和国外交部长拉姆苏伦关于片面对日和约的声明如下：
    关于美国政府和它的附佣国家与日本签订单独“和约”一事，蒙古人民共和国政府授权本人发表声明如下：
    （一）本年九月八日在旧金山签订的所谓对日“和约”，不是共同的和约，而只是由美国政府制造的单独的对日和约。
    在旧金山会议上，“多数”国家在美国压力之下，顺从美国，并经美国特别的布置，无耻地拒绝了苏联所提出而受到波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表支持的关于对日和约的公正建议；而且是未经讨论即卑躬屈节地在美英制造的对日和约上签字盖章。然而，在这个非法的文件上签字的大多数国家都没有实际参加对日作战，它们也不是亚洲的国家。
    对击溃帝国主义日本起决定作用的苏联，坚决拒绝了这个由美英统治集团片面制造的非法的对日和约，认为这是直接准备战争的罪恶行为。
    亚洲的主要国家，首先是中华人民共和国没有参加旧金山会议。中华人民共和国的人民遭受日本侵略的损失最大，而且对消灭日本帝国主义起了巨大的作用。蒙古人民共和国的军队，曾直接参加对日本作战，对击败日本帝国主义的事业也尽力作了它的贡献。但是竟被非法地拒绝于对日和约的准备和签订之外。
    因此，由美国授意没有苏联、中华人民共和国和对战胜帝国主义日本有直接贡献的其他亚洲国家签字的对日“和约”，不能而且也的确不符合亚洲各国的利益。因此，也不能为这些国家的人民所接受。
    蒙古人民共和国政府表达全体蒙古人民的一致意志，认为美国政府所制造的对日“和约”是非法的，没有法律效力的。因此坚决抗议这个对日“和约”。
    （二）单独对日“和约”严重地破坏了关于对日媾和的国际协定。
    大家知道，一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦公告以及远东委员会以这项公告为原则而通过的决定，都规定必须肃清日本的军国主义并使日本民主化。但是，在美英单独对日“和约”中，却没有防止日本军国主义复活的任何保证。相反的，在与这个文件同一天签订的美日双边《安全条约》上，却规定延长美军的对日占领，并且为日本军国主义的复活开辟了方便的道路。
    美国政府背信弃义地违背它所担负的义务，侵犯中华人民共和国对于台湾、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛和其他岛屿的无可争辩的权利，这些岛屿历来就是中国的领土。单独对日“和约”的起草人甚至竟非法地把琉球、小笠原、硫磺、西之岛及其他群岛割离日本，而实际上给予了美国。这些岛屿的分割，是任何国际协定都没有规定的。美英单独和约的主要任务，是要加强日本经济对美国的依赖，无视不得限制日本和平工业必要性。同时，却又为日本战争工业的恢复和发展提供了无限的机会。
    因此，旧金山签订的对日和约与各国际协定所规定的远东媾和毫不相干，而只是帮助美帝国主义者正在进行的发动和扩大战争的勾当，并破坏远东和全世界的和平与安全。苏联代表团在旧金山会议上对美制对日和约草案所提出的明确而具体的修正案和补充，得到了所有亚洲各国人民的衷心支持，包括我们蒙古人民在内。
    蒙古人民共和国政府并声明：只有接受苏联关于对日和约的旨在确保远东和全世界和平与安全的正义建议，才能作为按照国际协定的精神真正对日媾和的基础，并符合那些曾遭受日本帝国主义侵略之害的各国人民的意志和期望。
    （三）非法的单独对日和约，是要复活日本的军国主义，并将日本卷入反对亚洲爱好和平的各国人民，首先是反对苏联、中国与朝鲜各国人民的新的冒险中。然而，历史已经证明，日本军国主义分子对于亚洲任何国家的侵略，总要直接威胁到亚洲一切其他国家，包括蒙古在内。
    蒙古人民最危险的宿敌日本帝国主义者，在一九○九年占领了朝鲜以后不久，就开始实行其对蒙古的贪得无餍的计划。一九一九年他们在赤塔成立以卖身投靠日本帝国主义的奈塞活佛为首的所谓“大蒙古政府”。这个政府的任务就是把蒙古的一切部落统一起来，使它们处于日本的庇护之下。
    为了要使蒙古成为反苏战争的跳板，日本军国主义分子就于次年把他们雇佣的血腥的文格恩男爵所统率的白卫军匪徒调到蒙古来。日本于一九三一年占领满洲以后，它侵略蒙古的危险就特别严重而直接了。从此以后，一直到一九四五年，我国无时不处于遭受日本侵略的危险中。在这个期间以内，他们屡次对我国实行武装进攻，侵犯我们蒙古人民的自由与独立，使蒙古人民共和国在人力与物资上受到巨大损失。
    现在，美帝国主义者正在拟制他们反对爱好和平各国人民的罪恶计划。他们正在复活日本军国主义，并且公开使用日本的后备物资和人力来进行他们对朝鲜和中国的武装冒险。蒙古人民不能看到准备重演日本对包括我国在内的亚洲各国的侵略而漠不关心。
    蒙古人民深切地关怀真正的对日媾和以及防止日本帝国主义的复活，他们坚决抗议在旧金山缔结的准备战争与侵略的条约。
    蒙古人民与苏联、亚洲各国和全世界所有爱好和平的人民一起，有充分决心防止因单独对日和约而产生的在远东扩大战争的危险，并且要不遗余力粉碎这个非法文件的制订者——美英新战争挑拨者——的阴谋。
