Seriously treating the telegrams of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin is an important issue in newspaper editing work. Neglecting the importance of this issue is a political error. Most newspapers across the country pay relatively close attention to this issue, but a few newspapers do not pay enough attention to it, and therefore, errors often occur.

For example, some newspapers demonstrated this situation when handling the congratulatory messages from Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Marshal Stalin, on the anniversary of the "September 3rd" victory in the Anti-Japanese War.

Without a doubt, these two telegrams demonstrated the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and the unparalleled strength of the forces defending peace in the Far East. Especially at a time when American imperialism is frantically rearming Japan and attempting to expand its war adventures in Asia, these two telegrams, which have great political significance, have a tremendous inspirational effect on the people of our country and the peace-loving people of the world.

Most newspapers across the country (35 above the province and city level), because they clearly recognized the political significance of these two telegrams, published both telegrams in prominent positions on the "September 3rd" anniversary. This serious and solemn attitude towards the telegrams of the heads of state of China and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly correct.

However, there were still 20 newspapers that were not serious and responsible enough when handling these two congratulatory telegrams. For example, five newspapers (Liaoxi Daily, Songjiang Daily, Rehe Masses Daily, Chuandong Newspaper - bi-daily, Shaanxi Daily - bi-daily) published both telegrams, but delayed the publication until September 4th or 5th. Another thirteen newspapers (Shanghai Liberation Daily, Xi'an Masses Daily, Jilin Daily, Heilongjiang Daily, Chuanbei Daily, Chuanxi Daily, New Qian Daily, Guangxi Daily, New Hunan Daily, Inner Mongolia Daily, Pingyuan Daily, Suiyuan Daily, Shanxi Daily) only published Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to Marshal Stalin on "September 3rd," while Stalin's reply telegram to Chairman Mao was delayed until September 4th or 5th. These newspapers' practice of publishing separately or delaying publication inevitably affected the integrity and effectiveness of the telegram's publicity. In addition, there were two newspapers that handled it even more inappropriately. For example, the Ningxia Daily published Stalin's reply telegram to Chairman Mao after the "News Express," and then did not publish it in the main newspaper; the Qinghai Daily (tri-daily) published both telegrams entirely in the "Daily News," and did not publish them in the main newspaper either. The approach taken by these two newspapers towards the telegrams of the heads of state not only weakened their educational effect on the broad masses of the people, but was also an extremely unserious manifestation politically.

The reason why these newspapers did not publish these two extremely important telegrams simultaneously and in a timely manner, or even did not publish them at all or only published one, according to this newspaper's investigation of eighteen newspaper offices (missing Songjiang Daily, Chuanxi Daily) and the public self-criticism of individual newspaper offices, in addition to the fact that some newspaper offices were unable to publish Stalin's reply telegram at the same time because the newspapers had already been printed and plated, or had no radio station to copy, seven newspaper offices did not recognize the importance of these two telegrams, resulting in undue political negligence or errors.

For example, the staff of Qinghai Daily and Ningxia Daily believed that since the telegrams had already been published in their edited and printed "Daily News" or "News Express," there was no need to publish them in the main newspaper again. This understanding is obviously wrong. The reason for this error, as they themselves have reviewed, is because "they did not recognize the great political significance of these two telegrams, nor did they recognize that this was a manifestation of the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union." After receiving Chairman Mao's congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin on the morning of September 2nd, the Liaoxi Daily was originally able to typeset it (the newspaper page was only assembled at 12 noon), but it was also because the staff member who edited the telegram "did not realize that this was a news item with great political significance and strong timeliness, and left it for publication the next day according to the usual habits." Obviously, this view of treating the telegrams of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin as ordinary telegrams is a manifestation of a lack of national consciousness.

Shanghai Liberation Daily and Inner Mongolia Daily suppressed Stalin's reply telegram without authorization because the duty personnel did not ask the editor-in-chief's office for instructions. This phenomenon of acting arbitrarily without organization or discipline also existed seriously among the telegraphic affairs staff of the Shanxi Daily and the Hunan Branch of the Xinhua News Agency. According to the responsible persons of the New Hunan Daily and the Shanxi Daily editor-in-chief's office, these telegraphic affairs personnel delayed for a considerable period of time before sending the Xinhua News Agency's communique and telegram about the broadcast of Stalin's reply telegram to the editorial department. This was an unforgivable oversight.

The most fundamental reason for all these political oversights or errors is that these editors and telegraphic affairs personnel do not recognize or do not fully recognize the importance of the telegrams of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin. Therefore, it is impossible for them to clearly recognize that seriously treating the telegrams of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin is an important issue in newspaper work.

This incorrect understanding is also manifested in the fact that some newspapers did not place the two telegrams in a prominent position. For example, although the Guangxi Daily published the two telegrams on the first page, they were placed in the middle of the page; the New Qian Daily placed Chairman Mao's telegram to Marshal Stalin at the bottom of the first page; and the Shaanxi Daily and the Ningxia Daily carelessly published the two telegrams and Chairman Mao's telegram to Stalin on the third or fourth page, which shows that there is still a tendency towards non-politicization in the editorial departments of these newspapers. They did not eliminate the difficulties that could be eliminated, and tried their best to publish the two telegrams simultaneously and in a prominent position. The editorial departments of newspapers that have made such mistakes should conduct a profound ideological examination and use this to educate all staff to clearly establish a national concept and seriously treat the telegrams of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin.

### 严肃地对待毛主席和斯大林大元帅的函电

    严肃地对待毛主席和斯大林大元帅的函电
    严肃地对待毛主席和斯大林大元师的函电，是报纸编辑工作中一个重要问题。忽视这一个问题的重要性，则是政治性的错误。全国大多数的报纸，对这一问题是比较注意的，但也有少数报纸对此不够注意，因而经常发生错误。
    例如，有些报纸在“九三”抗日战争胜利纪念日处理中央人民政府毛泽东主席和苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅的贺电时，就表现出这种情形。
    毫无疑问，这两件电文显示了中、苏两国牢不可破的友谊，显示了保卫远东和平力量的无比强大。特别是正值美帝国主义疯狂重新武装日本，企图在亚洲扩大战争冒险之际，这两件具有重大政治意义的电文，对于我国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民更有巨大的鼓舞作用。
    全国多数报纸（省市以上三十五家），因为明确认识了这两件电文的政治意义，所以，在“九三”纪念日，都以显著地位把这两件电文一起刊出。这种认真、严肃对待中、苏两国元首电文的态度，无疑是正确的。
    但还有二十家报纸，在处理这两件贺电时，不够严肃负责。例如有五家报纸（辽西日报、松江日报、热河群众日报、川东报——两日刊、陕西日报——两日刊）虽将这两件电文同时发表，但在时间上则延迟到九月四日或五日。另有十三家报纸（上海解放日报、西安群众日报、吉林日报、黑龙江日报、川北日报、川西日报、新黔日报、广西日报、新湖南报、内蒙古日报、平原日报、绥远日报、山西日报），在“九三”仅发表了毛主席给斯大林大元帅的贺电，而对斯大林给毛主席的复电则迟至九月四日或五日才发表。这些报纸采取分登或延迟刊登的办法，必然会影响对电文宣传的完整性和宣传的效力。此外，还有两家报纸比这处理得更为不当。如宁夏日报把斯大林给毛主席的复电，刊登在《新闻快报》后，就没有再在正报上刊登了；青海日报（三日刊）则将这两件电文完全刊登在《每日新闻》上，亦没有再在正报上刊登。该两报对待国家元首函电所采取的这种办法，不仅减弱了它对广大人民群众的教育作用，而且是政治上极其不严肃的表现。
    这些报纸所以没有将这两件极为重要的电文同时、及时地刊登，甚至根本不刊登或只登一件，根据本报对十八家报社（缺松江日报、川西日报）的调查与个别报社的公开检讨来看，除部分报社是因为报纸已经付印、打版，或无电台收抄，致不能同时刊出斯大林给毛主席的复电外，有七家报纸则是由于有关人员没有认识到这两件电文的重要性，以致造成不应有的政治疏忽或错误。
    例如，青海日报和宁夏日报的工作人员就是因为电文已在他们编印的《每日新闻》或《新闻快报》上发表，便认为没有在正报上再发表的必要了。这种认识显然是错误的。造成这个错误的原因，正如他们自己所检讨的，是由于“没有认识到这两件电文的重大政治意义、没有认识到这是中苏两国伟大友谊的表现”。辽西日报在九月二日上午收到毛主席给斯大林大元帅的贺电后，本来来得及发排的（中午十二时，报版才拼好），也是因为编辑电稿的人员“没认识到这是具有重大政治意义和时间性强的电讯稿，即按平日习惯留待第二日发稿”。很显然，这种把毛主席和斯大林大元帅的电文视同一般电文的观点，是缺乏国家观念的表现。
    由于值班人员没请示总编室，而擅自压下斯大林复电的，有上海解放日报和内蒙古日报。这种自作主张的无组织无纪律现象，在山西日报和新华社湖南分社的电务工作人员中同样严重地存在着。据新湖南报和山西日报总编室负责人说，这些电务人员收到新华社关于播发斯大林复电的公报及电文后，延迟了相当长的时间才送到编辑部。这是不应该有的疏忽。
    所有这些政治疏忽或错误，其最基本的原因，是由于这些编辑人员和电务人员不认识或不完全认识毛主席和斯大林大元帅函电的重要性。因而也就不可能明确认识：严肃地对待毛主席和斯大林大元帅的函电是报纸工作中一个重要的问题。
    这种不正确的认识，还表现在有些报纸未将该两电放在显著的地位。例如，广西日报虽将两电刊登在第一版上，却放在版面的中间；新黔日报把毛主席给斯大林大元帅的电文放在一版的下面；又如陕西日报将这两件电文，宁夏日报将毛主席给斯大林的电文，竟轻率地刊登在第三版或第四版上，这就说明，在这些报纸编辑部里，还存在着非政治化的倾向。它们没有排除可能排除的困难，想尽办法把这两件电文同时刊出，并放在显著地位。犯有这样错误的报纸编辑部，应该从思想上作深刻的检查，并以此教育全体工作人员明确确立国家观念，严肃地对待毛主席和斯大林大元帅的函电。
