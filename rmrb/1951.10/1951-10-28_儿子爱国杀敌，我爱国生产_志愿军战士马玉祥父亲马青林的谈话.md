Editor's Note: The Korean War dispatch "Who Are the Most Lovable People" once described the heroic deeds of Volunteer soldier Ma Yuxiang. Recently, Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, went to Qinggang County to express his condolences to Ma Qinglin, Ma Yuxiang's father. The following is a speech by Ma Qinglin.

I was plastering the granary at home, covered in mud, when the district chief came to my house and said, "Chairman Yu of the Provincial People's Government has come to visit you." This was something I never dreamed of. At the time, I thought: my son Ma Yuxiang, who joined the army, and I used to be people who suffered. Thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we were able to turn over and live a good life. Chairman Yu is one of the leaders who led us to turn over! I was so happy, I quickly put down the mud trowel, wiped the mud off my body, and went to see Chairman Yu.

Seeing him was like seeing a relative. He came all the way to our Qinggang County and, without even taking a good rest, he was busy visiting our military families. How could this not move people? Chairman Yu talked to me a lot, asking how my life was, how the substitute farming was going, how my family was, and whether the crops were good this year. I told him: The district and the folks take good care of us. Our family of ten has been allocated nine and a half *qing* of land, two rooms, and a horse. The folks are substitute farming five *qing* of land for us, and we are planting four and a half *qing* ourselves. This year is a good year. Since Ma Yuxiang joined the army, our family's life has not been difficult at all.

Ma Yuxiang sent me a letter some time ago. He voluntarily requested to go from the artillery company to the infantry company. In his letter, he said, "The closer I am to the enemy, the more enjoyable I feel fighting, and the more I feel it is relieving my hatred." It's the same as what was published in the newspaper. I replied to him, "You are right. If we don't defeat the American devils, we won't be able to live a good life! Don't forget how much you suffered from the Japanese devils when you were a child! The American devils are just like the Japanese devils."

Chairman Yu also gave me some consolation money and told me to buy things.

Chairman Yu is really concerned about us military families. I will definitely maintain the honor of a military family member. I know the principle that without a country, there is no home. I responded to the three major appeals of the China Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and donated 600 *jin* of grain and four chicks to express my patriotism. I will also step up production to support the struggle to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. My son loves the country and kills the enemy, I love the country and produce: this is my family's determination to answer the people of the whole country and to answer Chairman Yu's concern for us.

    儿子爱国杀敌，我爱国生产
    ——志愿军战士马玉祥父亲马青林的谈话
    编者按：朝鲜通讯“谁是最可爱的人”一文里，曾叙述过一段关于志愿军战士马玉祥的英勇事迹。最近黑龙江省人民政府于毅夫主席曾亲赴青冈县慰问马玉祥的父亲马青林。下面是马青林的一篇谈话。
    我正在家里墁仓子，混身净泥，区长到我家告诉说：“省人民政府于主席来慰问你来了。”这是我作梦也想不到的事情。当时我想：我和参军的儿子马玉祥从前都是受苦的人，得亏共产党和人民政府领导才翻了身，过着好日子。于主席就是领导我们翻身的一个领袖呀！我喜欢的了不得，赶紧放下泥板子，擦擦身上的泥点子，去见于主席。
    见了面好像看到亲人一样。他大老远到我们青冈县来，也没好好歇歇，就忙着访问我们军属。这怎不使人感动呢？于主席和我谈了好多话，问我生活怎样，代耕地怎样，家里的人们怎样，今年的庄稼好不好。我告诉他：区上和老乡们对我们照顾的可好啦。全家十口人，分了九垧半地，二间房，一匹马，老乡给代耕五垧地，自己种四垧半，今年是好年头。自从马玉祥参军以后，家里生活一点也没困难着。
    马玉祥上些日子给我来了信，他从炮兵连自动要求到步兵连去了，他在信里说：“离敌人越近，越觉着打得过瘾，越觉着打得解恨。”和报上登的一样。我给他回信说：“你说得对，要不打垮美国鬼子，咱们的日子算过不好啊！不要忘了，你小时候受日本鬼子的欺侮多苦呀！美国鬼子跟日本鬼子一个样。”
    于主席还送给我一些慰问金，叫我买东西。
    于主席对我们军属真关心。我一定保持军属的光荣。我知道没有国就没有家的道理，我响应了抗美援朝总会的三大号召，捐献了六百斤粮食和四只小鸡，表表爱国心情。我还要加劲生产，支援抗美援朝斗争。儿子爱国杀敌，我爱国生产：这就是我家回答全国人民、回答于主席关心我们的决心。    （董毓懋记录）
