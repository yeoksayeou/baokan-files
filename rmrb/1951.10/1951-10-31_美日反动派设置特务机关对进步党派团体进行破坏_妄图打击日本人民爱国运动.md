Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 30th: Tokyo dispatch: To further undermine the Japanese people’s movement against the separate peace treaty and the “U.S.-Japan Security Treaty,” and to crack down on members of the Diet who oppose the ratification of this traitorous treaty, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have specifically established a special agency. This special agency is led by the "Blood Alliance," organized by Jiro Hoshijima, Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Masumi Ezaki, a member of the Diet, and Ryutaro Nemoto, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, all appointed by Shigeru Yoshida, the leader of the ruling faction of the Liberal Party. Yoshida personally ordered former leaders of the Japanese secret police to be responsible for directing its actual work. The operating expenses are jointly paid by Ridgway Headquarters and the Liberal Party leadership. On the one hand, this agency is directing sabotage activities against the Japanese Communist Party and progressive organizations, and on the other hand, it is using bribery, enticement, intimidation, and division tactics against all opposition parties and Diet members who opposed the ratification of the separate peace treaty and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" in the 12th Extraordinary Diet session. It is said that a large spy network of hundreds of people has been established within the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party. Right-wing elements of the Socialist Party, such as Suzo Miwa, Matsuoka [?], Masu Sone, Ryozo Kato, and Tei Hatano, have been bought over and utilized by this special agency. Yoshida is attempting to use them to create divisions within the Socialist Party to force the party's Diet members to approve Yoshida's traitorous treaty.

    美日反动派设置特务机关对进步党派团体进行破坏
    妄图打击日本人民爱国运动
    【新华社上海三十日电】东京消息：美、日反动派为了进一步破坏日本人民反对单独和约及“美日安全条约”的运动，并打击反对批准该卖国条约的国会议员，已专门设立了一个特务机关。该特务机关系由自由党当权派吉田茂指派自由党总务会长星岛二郎、国会议员江崎真澄及农林相根本龙太郎等组织的“血盟团”负责领导；并由吉田亲自下令调用前日本秘密警察领导人员负责指挥其实际工作。工作经费则由李奇微总部和自由党领导机关共同支付。该机关一方面正在指挥对日本共产党和进步团体的破坏活动，同时对所有反对党派及在日本第十二届临时国会中反对批准单独和约及“美日安全条约”的议员，施以收买、拉拢、恫吓及分化等手段。据称，目前已在民主党及社会党内建立了一个由数百人组成的庞大间谍网，社会党右翼分子三轮寿壮、松冈?吉、曾祢益、加藤镣造、波多野鼎等，已被这一特务机关收买利用。吉田妄图借他们在社会党内制造分裂活动，来迫使该党国会议员赞成批准吉田的卖国条约。
