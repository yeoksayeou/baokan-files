    Xu Ziyi, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai China Industrial Bank,
    Dismissed and Prosecuted for Embezzling 100 Million Yuan
    To the Editor:
    On January 26, 1951, our committee received a letter, transferred from the Premier's Office of the Government Administration Council, containing an anonymous accusation of collective embezzlement by senior staff members of the jointly owned public-private Shanghai China Industrial Bank. After investigation by the People's Supervisory Committee of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, together with the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China, it was found that Xu Ziyi, the bank's deputy manager, had colluded with private merchants to engage in private gain and malpractice using bank funds, embezzling 100 million yuan in Renminbi. Xu Ziyi has now been dismissed from his post and handed over to the court for punishment according to the law. As for other personnel, there was no evidence of joint malpractice.
        People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
    Editor's Note: The person who reported the embezzlement case of senior staff members of the Shanghai China Industrial Bank wrote an anonymous letter. The People's Supervisory Committee was unable to reply to the original informant and has sent a summary of the investigation results to this newspaper for publication.
