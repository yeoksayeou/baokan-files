Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 22nd: "Pravda" reporter Dekachenko reports from Pyongyang: The huge losses, the approaching winter, and the hopeless future are making the U.S. troops invading Korea increasingly frustrated, panicked, and confused.

U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Clark, captured on the eastern front, talked a lot about the American "way of life" during interrogation; but when the topic turned to the future of the Korean War, Clark hesitated for a moment before saying: "Yes, many American soldiers have lost hope of surviving Korea and want to find a way to end this bloody war as soon as possible."

Dekachenko said: American soldiers are becoming more and more dissatisfied with the aggressive war launched by American imperialists in Korea. The U.S. military command is therefore extremely panicked and has taken strict measures. According to the testimony of prisoners of war: the U.S. Department of the Army has been extensively "rotating" personnel in various U.S. regiments and divisions in the past three months, and "suspicious" and "low-spirited" soldiers have been transferred from Korea to Japan to do occupation work, and new troops have been sent to replace them. Many pastors and "instructors" have been added to the U.S. military to boost the morale of the soldiers. Previously, there was only one pastor per regiment, but now there is one per battalion.

Dekachenko pointed out: The U.S. government is trying to keep American public opinion from knowing the obvious fact that the morale of American and other "United Nations" soldiers has greatly declined.

    伤亡惨重，生还无望
    侵朝美军士气低沉
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：“真理报”记者德卡诚科自平壤报道：巨大的损失、临近的冬天和无望的前途，使得侵朝美军官兵日益沮丧、惊慌和混乱。
    在东线被俘的美军中校克拉克在受审问时大谈其美国“生活方式”；但是在话题转到了朝鲜战争的前途时，克拉克踌躇了一会才说：“是的，许多美国兵已失去了从朝鲜生还的希望，并想尽快找到结束这个血腥战争的方法。”
    德卡诚科说：美国士兵对美帝国主义者在朝鲜所发动的侵略战争一天比一天感到不满。美军司令部因此极为恐慌，并采取了严厉的措施。根据战俘的证明：美国陆军部在过去三个月内已在大量地“更换”美国各团和各师的人员，“可疑的”和“士气低落的”士兵已从朝鲜调到日本去做占领工作，新的军队已被派来代替他们。美军中已增加了许多牧师和“教官”来提高士兵们的士气。以前每团只有一个牧师，现在一营就有一个。
    德卡诚科指出：美国政府正企图使美国舆论不知道这一个明显的事实，即美国和其他“联合国”士兵的士气已大为低落。
