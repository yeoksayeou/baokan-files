    The Central China Bureau of the CCP Instructs Wuhan Municipal Committee to Seriously Handle the Incident of Song Ying et al. Suppressing Criticism
    Yangtze River Daily Publishes Editorial, Wuhan Municipal Committee Makes Self-Criticism Report
    On September 11th, this newspaper's "Party Life" column criticized the erroneous behavior of Song Ying, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau and a Communist Party member, et al., for suppressing mass criticism and seriously violating Party discipline. The Central China Bureau of the CCP paid great attention to this and instructed the Wuhan Municipal Committee and the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government on September 14th to seriously handle this incident. The Wuhan Municipal Committee held a meeting of all Municipal Committee members on September 16th for self-criticism. On September 27th, the Wuhan Yangtze River Daily published the instructions of the Central China Bureau of the CCP to the Wuhan Municipal Committee, the self-criticism report of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, and an editorial on this incident, occupying most of the front page. In addition, the Yangtze River Daily also made a public self-criticism for improperly handling this incident and reprinted in full this newspaper's article criticizing the errors of Song Ying et al.
    The Yangtze River Daily pointed out in its editorial that the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central China Bureau of the CCP had twice instructed the Wuhan Municipal Committee in the past year to seriously address the incident of Song Ying et al. suppressing mass criticism, but the Wuhan Municipal Committee had not earnestly implemented the aforementioned instructions. The editorial criticized this erroneous attitude of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, advocated disciplinary action against Song Ying et al., and proposed using this incident as vivid teaching material to educate all Party members, especially leading cadres, combining it with the study of relevant documents from the Central Committee of the CCP and the Central China Bureau of the CCP, to discuss the nature, root causes, and harmfulness of this error, and to propose methods for correction and prevention. The editorial suggested that the Wuhan Municipal Committee should call on all Party members and non-Party cadres to boldly expose and criticize such phenomena of suppressing criticism and all other behaviors that violate Party discipline. The upcoming Fourth Party Congress of the Wuhan Municipal Committee should include strict Party discipline as one of its agenda items. At the same time, the Party Discipline Inspection Committee should take the serious handling of this incident as a starting point and deal with all other incidents of violating Party discipline with a serious attitude to change this phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline.
    The Wuhan Municipal Committee fully agreed with this newspaper's comments on this issue and firmly supported the Central China Bureau's instructions on this issue. It pointed out that it was wrong in the past not to conduct public criticism of comrades who violated discipline and persisted in their errors, and not to give them the necessary punishment. The Municipal Committee decided: (1) Song Ying, Zhou Jifang, the Party Group of the Municipal Government, and the General Branch of the Health Bureau must make strict written self-criticisms based on the spirit of the aforementioned documents and the Municipal Committee's self-criticism report, and submit them to the Municipal Committee for review. (2) To uphold Party discipline, disciplinary action should be taken against Song Ying and Zhou Jifang. (3) The relevant documents on handling this issue should be published in the Party newspaper to call on Party members throughout the city to study them, launch discussions in all agencies throughout the city, and eliminate the bad style of suppressing criticism undemocratically.

    中共中央中南局指示武汉市委
    认真处理宋瑛等压制批评事件
    长江日报为此发表社论，武汉市委作出检讨报告
    九月十一日，本报“党的生活”栏批评了武汉市卫生局副局长、共产党员宋瑛等压制群众批评、严重违犯党的纪律的错误行为，中共中央中南局对此甚为注意，当于九月十四日指示武汉市委和武汉市人民政府党组，认真处理这一事件。武汉市委已于九月十六日召开全体市委委员会议作了检讨。九月二十七日，武汉长江日报以第一版的绝大部分篇幅，登载了中共中央中南局给武汉市委的指示、武汉市委的检讨报告以及关于此一事件的社论。此外，长江日报因处理此一事件不当，亦作公开检讨；并全部转载了本报批评宋瑛等错误的文章。
    长江日报在社论中指出：一年来，中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会曾两次指示武汉市委，应严肃对待宋瑛等压制群众批评的事件，但武汉市委并未认真执行上述指示。社论批评了武汉市委的这种错误态度，主张予宋瑛等以纪律处分。并提出应以这一事件作为教育全体党员的生动教材，在全体党员中，首先在领导干部中，结合着对中共中央和中共中央中南局有关文件的学习，对这一问题展开讨论，分析这种错误的性质、根源及其危害性，提出纠正和防止的办法。社论建议武汉市委要号召所有的党员及非党员干部对于此类压制批评的现象以及一切其他违犯党的纪律的行为，大胆地揭发和批判。在武汉市委即将召开的第四次党的代表会议中，应将严肃党的纪律作为议题之一。同时党的纪律检查委员会，应以认真处理此一事件为起点，用严肃的态度来处理其他一切违犯党纪的事件，以转变这种无组织无纪律的现象。
    武汉市委完全同意本报对于这一问题的评论，坚决拥护中南局有关这一问题的指示；并指出：过去对于违犯纪律、坚持错误的同志，未展开公开的批评，未给以必要的处分，是不对的。市委决定：（一）宋瑛、周季方、市府党组及卫生局总支须根据上述文件的精神及此次市委的检讨报告，作出严格的书面检讨，交市委审查。（二）为严肃党纪，给宋瑛和周季方以纪律处分。（三）在党报上公布有关处理这一问题的文件，号召全市党员学习，在全市各机关展开讨论，肃清不民主的压制批评的恶劣作风。
