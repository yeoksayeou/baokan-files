Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th - Our special correspondent reports: Ridgway was forced for the second time before the people of the world to admit the incident of American aircraft strafing the Kaesong Neutral Zone. Because the two attacks on the Neutral Zone by American aircraft on the afternoon of the 12th were carried out in broad daylight. The number of aircraft and the type of aircraft were clearly seen, and it could no longer be denied by "radar reconnaissance reports." Therefore, Ridgway had no choice but to admit: These air raid incidents were "undoubtedly caused by United Nations Command aircraft violating explicit instructions – orders for all troops and pilots to avoid attacking or flying over the Kaesong area." Ridgway's letter admitting the U.S. aircraft strafed the Neutral Zone was delivered to our side at Panmunjom at 8:00 AM on the 15th. However, three hours and fifteen minutes later (i.e., at 11:15 AM), a U.S. B-26 light bomber flew low from northwest to southeast over Kaesong. "Undoubtedly," the American pilots once again violated the "order" reaffirmed by their commander-in-chief prohibiting flights over the Kaesong area. Moreover, this incident, admitted by Ridgway, of the United Nations Command violating the Kaesong area neutralization agreement occurred precisely when the United Nations Command liaison officers were delaying reaching an agreement on resuming the armistice talks, which cannot but raise serious doubts about whether the United Nations Command side still has the sincerity to resume the armistice negotiations. The liaison officer meetings, held since October 10th, were to prepare basic conditions for the resumption of the meetings of the two delegations, and these conditions had already reached a general agreement at the meetings. However, until the fifth meeting on the 15th, the other side's liaison officer still refused to reach an agreement on the consensus that had been reached, and therefore refused to enter into a discussion on the specific date and time for the resumption of the armistice negotiation meeting, causing the negotiation to fail to resume until now. Facts have proven that a strict agreement and a responsible attitude of abiding by the agreement are important guarantees for ensuring the smooth progress of the negotiations. And such an important issue should be resolved at the first meeting after the resumption of the meetings of the two delegations. On October 12, American aircraft strafed the vicinity of Panmunjom, killing one and injuring one of the Jiang family's children, arousing the resentment of the relatives of the dead and injured, and also arousing widespread sympathy from world public opinion for the victims. Due to this righteous indignation of the people, Ridgway had to issue a statement, pretending to be very "compassionate," he said: "The conduct of military operations often inevitably causes casualties to innocent non-combatants." He then stated that he felt "double regret" for such incidents occurring in the Neutral Zone. Yes, the two children of the Jiang family were innocent non-combatants, so what crime did Squad Leader Yao Qingxiang and others, who were loyal to protecting the duties of the Neutral Zone and killed by the Rhee Syngman troops commanded by the American Commander-in-Chief, commit? In fact, how many thousands of peaceful residents of Korea – the elderly, women, and children – have been massacred by American aircraft and artillery, and what crimes have they committed? People also remember that in July and August, Ridgway's representatives regarded this brutal American air force as a strength and wanted to obtain "ground compensation" during the armistice. Now Ridgway is pretending to be "compassionate." However, this false compassion can never extinguish the anger in the heart of Jiang Daxing, the old father of the Korean children, nor can it remove the deep hatred in the hearts of the Korean people for the American aggressors. If the U.S. side really has a little "compassionate" heart left, then they should immediately stop their delaying tactics, immediately resume the armistice negotiations, so that the bloody conflict in Korea can be brought to a reasonable end quickly.

Ridgway's Letter
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th - Ridgway's letter of the 14th is as follows: To Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung of the Korean People's Army: Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
The United Nations Command Air Force Commander has reported to me the results of his investigation into the two air raid incidents in Kaesong on the afternoon of October 12, 1951, at approximately 17:30. These were undoubtedly caused by United Nations Command aircraft violating explicit instructions - orders for all troops and pilots to avoid attacking or flying over the Kaesong area. Therefore, the United Nations Command accepts responsibility for these two incidents violating the existing agreement on the neutralization of the Kaesong area, and I will take swift and appropriate disciplinary measures.
		Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, General of the Army Matthew B. Ridgway
					October 14, 1951

    美方无法抵赖犯罪责任
    李奇微再次被迫承认美机扫射中立区
    但在承认之后竟又有美轰炸机从开城上空低飞而过
    人们不能不怀疑美方究竟是否还有恢复停战谈判的诚意
    【新华社开城十六日电】本社特派记者报道：李奇微在全世界人民的面前，第二次被迫承认了美国飞机扫射开城中立区的事件。因为在十二日下午所发生的美机向中立区的两次攻击，是在光天化日之下进行的。飞机的架数、机型都被看得清清楚楚，再不能用“雷达侦察报告”来抵赖。因此李奇微只得承认：这些空袭事件，“无可置疑地是联合国军的飞机违反了明确指令——一切部队与飞行员避免攻击或飞越开城区的命令而造成的。”李奇微承认美机扫射中立区责任给金彭两将军的信是在十五日上午八时在板门店送交我方的。但是在隔了三小时又十五分钟（即十一时十五分）以后，竟又有一架美国的B——二六轻轰炸机由西北向东南，从开城上空低飞而过。“无可置疑地”，美国的飞行员又一次违反了他们的总司令重申的禁止飞越开城区的“命令”。而且这次为李奇微所承认了的联合国军违反开城区中立化协议的事件，正发生于联合国军联络官拖延达成关于恢复停战会议的协议之时，不能不令人严重怀疑联合国军方面究竟是否尚有恢复停战谈判的诚意。从十月十日起举行的联络官会议，原是为了双方代表团的复会准备基本条件，这些条件在会上业已大致取得了一致的意见。但是，直到十五日的第五次会议，由于对方联络官仍然拒绝就已经取得的一致意见达成协议，因而不肯进入停战谈判会议的具体复会日期与时间的讨论，致使谈判至今未能恢复。事实证明：一个严格的协议以及遵守协议的负责态度，是保证谈判顺利进行的重要保证。而这样重要的问题，是应当放到双方代表团复会后的第一次会议上去解决的。十月十二日美机扫射板门店附近，使得姜家两个儿童一死一伤，激起了死伤者家属的愤恨，也引起了世界舆论对受害者的广泛同情。由于这种人民的义愤，李奇微不得不发表了一个声明，装出十分“慈悲”的样子，他说：“军事行动的进行常不得不造成无辜的非战斗人员的伤亡。”他接着表示，在中立区发生这样的事件是感到“双倍惋惜”的，是的，姜家两个儿童是无辜的非战斗人员，那么忠实于保护中立区职守的、被美国总司令指挥的李承晚部队杀害的姚庆祥排长等，又有什么罪辜呢？其实，朝鲜的和平居民——老年人、妇女、儿童被美国飞机炮火屠杀了何止万千，他们又有何罪辜？人们还记得，在七、八月间，李奇微的代表曾把美国这种残暴的空军当成力量，要在停战时取得“地面补偿”，现在李奇微却装起“慈悲”来了。但是，这种假慈悲决不能熄灭朝鲜儿童的老父亲姜大兴心中的怒火，也决不能除去朝鲜人民心中对美国侵略者的深刻的仇恨。如果美方果真还有一点“慈悲”的心肠，那么他们就应当立即停止他们的拖延战术，立即恢复停战谈判，以便使朝鲜的流血冲突迅速得到合理的结束。
    李奇微的来信 【新华社开城十六日电】李奇微十四日来信如下：朝鲜人民军金日成最高司令官：中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员：
    联合国军空军司令官已向我报告了他对一九五一年十月十二日下午约十七时三十分在开城区内的两次空袭事件的调查结果，这无可置疑地是联合国军的飞机违反了明确指令——一切部队与飞行员避免攻击或飞越开城区的命令而造成的。因此联合国军接受对于这两次违反现尚存在的关于开城区中立化协议的事件的责任，我并将采取迅速而适当的纪律措施。
        联合国军总司令美国陆军上将李奇微
                    一九五一年十月十四日
