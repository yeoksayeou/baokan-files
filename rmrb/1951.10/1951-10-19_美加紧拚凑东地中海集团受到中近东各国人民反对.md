Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: After the United States coerced North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries to pass a resolution at the Ottawa conference allowing Greece and Turkey to join the North Atlantic Treaty, it is stepping up its efforts to cobble together an Eastern Mediterranean aggression bloc as the southern flank of the North Atlantic war alliance. However, due to the opposition of the peoples of the Middle East and Near East, this American conspiracy is encountering increasing difficulties.

　　On October 7th, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, flew to Paris. On the 8th and 9th, he conferred with British Chief of the General Staff, Shilling, French Chief of the General Staff, Lecher, and Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Aggression Forces, Eisenhower, on the issue of establishing a Middle East aggression bloc. Subsequently, Bradley, Shilling, and Lecher went to Greece and Turkey. On the 11th, they held talks with the Greek government in Athens, and on the 13th and 14th, they held talks with the Turkish government in Ankara. According to a public statement issued by the Turkish government afterward, the content of the talks was to enable Greece and Turkey to "complete the formalities as soon as possible" in order to "join the North Atlantic Treaty" and establish a so-called "Middle East Command." While these talks were underway, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins visited Yugoslavia. According to the British "Daily Mirror," Collins discussed Yugoslavia joining the Eastern Mediterranean part of the North Atlantic Treaty with the Tito government. Simultaneously, the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey formally sent notes to the governments of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq on the 13th, "suggesting" that they participate in the Middle East group. Furthermore, the permanent organization of the North Atlantic Aggression Group in London—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Assistant Ministerial Meeting—issued a protocol on the 15th, based on the resolution of the Ottawa conference, "inviting" Greece and Turkey to join the North Atlantic Treaty. This protocol will soon be sent to the twelve signatory governments to complete the ratification process.

　　Organizing the Eastern Mediterranean aggression bloc is a long-planned conspiracy by the United States. The American plan is to use the three fascist countries of Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia as the backbone, and to form an Eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern group as a branch of the constantly expanding North Atlantic Group. The so-called "Middle East Joint Command" plan is a part of this plan. The United States intends to use its loyal lackey, the reactionary Turkish government, as the center, to form a group including Israel and various Arab countries. The aim is, first and foremost, to further turn the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries into military springboards for attacking the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries, and to make these countries bear the task of providing cannon fodder for the United States. According to a report by the Dentsu News Agency, Eisenhower urged Bradley, Shilling, and Lecher in Paris to gather 700,000 mercenaries from Greece and Turkey during their visit to Athens and Ankara.

　　In addition to preparing for an anti-Soviet war, the United States also wants to take this opportunity to seize Britain's dominant position in the region. This directly intensifies the contradictions between the United States and Britain in the Eastern Mediterranean. In July of this year, when Britain was forced to announce its agreement to the accession of Greece and Turkey to the North Atlantic Treaty under American pressure, it still tried to preserve its sphere of influence and insisted on establishing a Middle East Command led by a British general, attempting to maintain a British-controlled Middle East group within the North Atlantic Treaty. However, the United States has consistently insisted that Turkey should occupy an "important position" in the "Middle East Joint Command," so that it can control the group through Turkey. Therefore, the United States and Britain have had many fierce arguments over the command of the Middle East Command headquarters. Even at the Ankara conference, according to a statement issued by the Turkish government, "no decision has been reached."

　　The biggest difficulty encountered by the U.S. plan to organize the Eastern Mediterranean group is the rising anti-imperialist movement of the peoples of the Middle East and Near East. The Iranian government's decision to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the Egyptian government's declaration to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the agreement on the Anglo-Egyptian condominium of Sudan, and the Iraqi government's demand to revise the treaty on the British occupation of air force bases: these actions are shaking the foundations of British imperialism's rule in the Middle East and Near East. At the same time, due to the vigorous development of the movement of people from various countries against imperialist aggression, the conspiracy of American imperialists to intervene in the Middle East and Near East has also been severely hit. After the Egyptian government announced the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey sent a note to Egypt on October 13, proposing that Egypt join the Middle East group. This request was rejected by the Egyptian government on the 15th. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on the 15th, senior U.S. officials could not help but admit that this had caused them "great disappointment."

    美加紧拚凑东地中海集团受到中近东各国人民反对 【新华社十八日讯】美国胁迫北大西洋公约各国在渥太华会议上通过允许希腊和土耳其参加北大西洋公约的决议以后，正加紧拚凑东地中海侵略集团，作为北大西洋战争联盟的南翼。但是，由于中近东人民的反对，美国的这个阴谋，正碰到越来越大的困难。
    本月七日，美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷飞抵巴黎，八、九两日和英国参谋总长史陵、法国参谋总长勒歇尔以及北大西洋侵略军总司令艾森豪威尔就成立中东侵略集团的问题进行会商。接着，布莱德雷、史陵与勒歇尔即同去希腊及土耳其，十一日在雅典与希腊政府会谈，十三、十四日在安卡拉与土耳其政府会谈。据土耳其政府在事后发表的公报透露，会谈内容是使希土两国“从速完成手续”以“加入北大西洋公约”与成立所谓“中东司令部”。正当这些会谈进行之际，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯访问了南斯拉夫，据英国“每日写真报”透露：柯林斯曾与铁托政府讨论南斯拉夫加入北大西洋公约之东地中海部分。同时，美、英、法、土耳其四国政府在十三日正式照会埃及、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、伊拉克各国政府，“建议”它们参加中东集团。此外，在伦敦的北大西洋侵略集团常设机构——北大西洋公约外长助理会议已根据渥太华会议的决议，于十五日发表“邀请”希土两国参加北大西洋公约的议定书，这个议定书即将分送十二个缔约国政府完成批准手续。
    组织东地中海侵略集团是美国蓄意已久的阴谋。美国的计划是要以土耳其、希腊、南斯拉夫三个法西斯国家为骨干，把东地中海各国及中近东各国组成一个集团成为不断扩张着的北大西洋集团的一个分支。所谓“中东联合司令部”的计划就是这个计划中的一部分，美国打算把它的忠实走狗土耳其反动政府作为中心，组成包括以色列与各阿拉伯国家在内的集团。其目的首先就是为了进一步把各东地中海和中近东国家变成进攻苏联及东欧人民民主国家的军事跳板，并使这些国家负担为美国提供炮灰的任务。据电通社报道，艾森豪威尔曾在巴黎督促布莱德雷、史陵与勒歇尔在这次访问雅典和安卡拉时，要搜罗希土两国雇佣兵七十万人。
    除了准备反苏战争之外，美国还想借此夺取英国在这一地区的统治地位。这就直接引起美英两国在东地中海地区矛盾的加剧。今年七月，英国在美国压力下不得不宣布同意希、土两国加入北大西洋公约时，仍然力图保全它的势力范围，而坚持必须成立由英国将领领导的中东司令部，企图以此在北大西洋公约内部保持一个由英国所控制的中东集团。但是，美国却一直坚持土耳其应在“中东联合司令部”占据“重要地位”，这样使自己能通过土耳其来控制这个集团。因此，美英两国在中东集团司令部的指挥权问题上曾经发生过多次激烈的争吵。直到这次安卡拉会议，据土耳其政府的公报称，也还“没有得到任何决定”。
    美国组织东地中海集团计划所遭到的最大的困难是中近东各国人民的反帝国主义运动日益高涨。伊朗政府决定把英伊石油公司收归国有，埃及政府宣布废除英埃条约和关于英埃共管苏丹协定，伊拉克政府要求修改英国占用空军基地的条约：这些行动正动摇着英帝国主义在中东和近东的统治地位。同时，由于各国人民反对帝国主义侵略的运动蓬勃展开，美帝国主义者插足中近东的阴谋也受到有力地打击。在埃及政府宣布废除英埃条约之后，美、英、法、土耳其四国于十月十三日照会埃及，提出要埃及加入中东集团，这个要求已在十五日为埃及政府所拒绝。据合众社华盛顿十五日电透露：美国高级官员不能不承认此事已使他们“大为失望”。
