Also attending the ceremony were members of foreign diplomatic missions and representatives of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany.

President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic took his seat in the place of honor, and the audience burst into a storm of prolonged applause. Prime Minister Grotewohl, Deputy Prime Ministers, Foreign Minister Dautinguer, foreign delegations participating in the ceremony, and the West German delegation took their seats on the rostrum amidst warm applause.

Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic delivered a long speech.

After Grotewohl's speech, the participants in the ceremony passed a telegram of tribute to Stalin, the great leader of the peaceful and democratic camp, in a very enthusiastic atmosphere.

Next, Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet government delegation and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech, which was warmly welcomed by the audience.

The heads of delegations from West Germany, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Mongolia also delivered speeches, congratulating the German Democratic Republic on its second anniversary.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th. TASS dispatch from Berlin, June 6th: The National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued a declaration to the German people for the second anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, calling on all German people to struggle for the restoration of independence and unity.

The declaration pointed out: The German people are commemorating the second anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic in an atmosphere where peace is suffering serious danger. All patriotic Germans in East and West Germany support with hope the efforts made by the government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to maintain peace and restore German unity. In the two years since the founding of the German Democratic Republic, it has become a powerful force in European political life.

The Republic calls on the men and women compatriots of West Germany to take united patriotic action, because if world peace is not guaranteed by a democratically unified Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, then Washington's military agreement is bound to bring unprecedented large-scale disasters to our motherland. The declaration said: On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, we can point out with respect and gratitude to the heroic German patriotic people and peace fighters: The vast majority of our people oppose participating in a third world war and believe that participating in this war is suicidal and criminal. Increasingly wide sections of the German people are gradually convinced that the Soviet Union is the best friend of the German people. Thanks to the extensive assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and thanks to the new consciousness that has developed in the hearts of the working people in urban and rural areas and the close relationship between the government and the people, the German Democratic Republic has achieved great success in peaceful construction. This achievement also brings hope of success to the people in the western part of our motherland. This is the reason why the People's Chamber's clear proposal to hold an all-German conference has aroused such widespread resonance in cities and villages. This proposal has greatly opened the door to unity and peace.

The declaration concluded: On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany solemnly declares: Despite the negative attitude taken by the Bonn splitters, patriots throughout Germany will redouble their efforts and continue to struggle for the convening of an all-German conference. The German people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy will eventually sweep away all obstacles and build a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林六日讯：民主德国全国阵线全国委员会为德意志民主共和国建国两周年纪念，向德国人民发表宣言，号召全德人民为恢复独立、统一而斗争。
    宣言指出：德国人民正在和平遭受严重危险的气氛中纪念德意志民主共和国成立两周年。东西德一切爱国的德国人都满怀希望地支持德意志民主共和国政府和人民议会为维护和平与恢复德国统一而作的努力。德意志民主共和国建国两年来，已经变成欧洲政治生活中的强大力量。
    共和国号召西德的男女同胞们采取联合一致的爱国行动，因为如果不以民主统一的德国和缔结对德和约来保证世界和平，那末华盛顿的军事协议就势必给我们祖国带来空前大规模的灾难。宣言说：值此德意志民主共和国建国两周年之际，我们可以满怀着对英勇的德国爱国人民与和平战士尊敬与感谢的心情指出：我国人民绝大多数都反对参加第三次世界大战，并且认为参加这个战争是自杀和犯罪。越来越广泛的各阶层德国人民逐渐深信苏联是德国人民的至友。由于苏联与人民民主国家的广泛援助，由于已经在城乡劳动人民心中发展起来的新的觉悟和政府与人民间的密切联系，德意志民主共和国在和平建设方面已经获得巨大的成就。这种成就也给我们祖国西部的人民带来了成功的希望。人民议会关于举行全德会议的明确的建议所以在城市和乡村中引起了这样广泛的共鸣，其原因就在这里。这个建议已经大大地打开了走向统一与和平的大门。
    宣言最后说：当此德意志民主共和国成立二周年纪念之际，民主德国全国阵线全国委员会郑重宣布：尽管波恩分裂分子采取消极的态度，全德国的爱国者都将加倍努力，继续为召开全德会议而奋斗。德国人民争取独立、和平与民主的这个斗争，终将扫除一切障碍而建成统一、民主与爱好和平的德国。
