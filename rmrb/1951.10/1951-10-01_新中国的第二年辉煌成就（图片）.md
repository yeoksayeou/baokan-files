The people across the country have been widely educated in patriotism, enthusiastically launching a movement to donate airplanes and cannons. To date, donations have approached four trillion yuan, including 2,452 airplanes. These are scenes of the Mao Zedong Hao crew drawing up a donation plan (left), farmers in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, enthusiastically donating grain to purchase airplanes and cannons after a bumper harvest (center), and the Beijing business community collectively paying for airplane and cannon donations (right).

Land Reform
In the past year, land reform has been completed in areas with over 150 million agricultural population. Together with the previous areas, a total of more than 310 million agricultural population have completed land reform, accounting for two-thirds of the total population of the country, greatly enhancing the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the peasants. This is a scene of farmers in Linping District, Hang County, Zhejiang, carrying out land reform.

Democratic Governance
People's Representative Conferences have been convened in all 28 provinces of the country, except for Fujian. Of the 154 cities in the country under the jurisdiction of governments above the special commissioner level, 147 cities have convened People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses. Of the 2,068 counties in the country, 2,032 counties have convened People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses. Of the 117 administrative units in the country equivalent to counties, 104 have convened People's Representative Conferences. This is a great achievement, ensuring the progress of various constructions and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries
A vigorous movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has been carried out across the country, thereby educating the broad masses of the people, strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidating the rear of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and ensuring the progress of national construction. This is the expanded joint conference of people from all walks of life in Beijing, discussing the handling of counter-revolutionary criminals.

Industrial Production
In the first half of 1951, the total value of various major products of the national state-owned heavy industry sector reached 103% of the planned target, which was 72.2% of the total value of the entire year of 1950, and more than 44% higher than the same period last year. Coal production increased by more than 28% compared with last year, and nearly 8.97% in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year; the production of the iron and steel industry increased fourfold last year compared with the year before, and continues to increase this year; electricity generation increased by more than 14.46% last year compared with the year before, and increased by another 17.77% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. This is a scene of Zhang Zifu, a labor model from the Fushun Coal Mine, working. He is now the vice chairman of the Fushun Open-pit Mine Trade Union (left), and a corner of the exterior of a steel plant (right).

Transportation
To date, more than 22,600 kilometers of railways across the country have been opened to traffic. The mileage of highways has increased fivefold compared with the early days of the national liberation. This is a scene of the reopening of the No. 8 bridge on the Longhai Railway after repairs.

Bumper Harvest of Cotton and Grain
Although the rainfall this year was not as good as last year, the agricultural harvest was still better than last year. Grain increased by more than 8% compared with last year; cotton production may reach a historical record.

Disasters are also lighter than last year. The affected area this year is 40 million mu, a decrease of 30 million mu compared with last year, and a decrease of 80 million mu compared with the year before last. This is a scene of women's mutual aid teams picking cotton in the fields during the bumper harvest of cotton in Jingyang, Guanzhong, Shaanxi, a major cotton-producing area in China (left), and a scene of farmers in Ludian Town, Yichuan County, Henan, harvesting a bumper crop of grain (right).

After the peasants were emancipated through land reform, they generally demanded to learn culture. At present, more than 25 million peasants across the country have entered winter schools, and more than 10 million peasants have entered regular people's schools. This is a scene of peasants in Zhaicheng Village, Ding County, Hebei, reading newspapers while participating in winter school.

Culture and Education
The number of educated workers across the country has increased significantly, with more than 1.7 million workers participating in spare-time schools. This is a scene of workers in Lushun-Dalian studying in a cultural supplementary school.

Harnessing the Huai River
The first-year project of harnessing the Huai River, carried out according to Chairman Mao's instructions, has been successfully completed before the flood season, ensuring the bumper harvest of the summer and autumn seasons in the Huai River basin this year, showing the infinitely beautiful prospects of the Huai River basin after the entire project is completed. These are the model figures in the Runheji diversion sluice construction project of the Huai River: special-class meritorious worker Xie Hongyou (left), first-class meritorious worker Li Xiuying (center), and first-class meritorious railway worker Wang Changhui.

Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, annihilated a total of more than 302,000 enemies from October 25 last year to September 5 this year, including more than 140,000 U.S. troops and troops from Britain, France, Turkey, and other countries, and shot down or damaged 1,578 U.S. aircraft. This is a scene of captured enemy prisoners being escorted to the rear.

The vigorous struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has achieved great victories, driving the enemy who invaded near the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel and forcing the enemy to accept armistice negotiations. This is a scene of commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers solemnly swearing an oath to resolutely eliminate the American aggressors in Korea.

    新中国的第二年辉煌成就
    全国各地人民普遍受到了爱国主义教育，热烈展开捐献飞机大炮运动。到目前为止，捐献已接近四万亿元，内飞机二千四百五十二架。这是毛泽东号包乘组正在制订捐献计划（左）、浙江萧山农民丰收后热烈捐献粮食购买飞机大炮（中）和北京市工商界集体缴纳飞机大炮捐款的情形（右）。
    土地改革
    一年来已有一亿五千万以上农业人口地区完成了土地改革，连以前共有三亿一千多万农业人口地区完成了土地改革，占全国总人口的三分之二，大大地提高了农民的政治觉悟和生产热情。这是浙江杭县临平区农民进行土地改革时的情形。
    民主建政
    全国二十八省，除福建外，均已召开各界人民代表会议。全国辖于专署以上政府的城市共有一百五十四个，已召开各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会的共一百四十七市。全国有二千零六十八县，已召开人民代表会议或人民代表大会的共有二千零三十二县。全国相当于县的行政单位共计一百一十七个，已召开人民代表会议的一百零四个。这是很大的成绩，保障了各种建设的进行和巩固了人民民主专政。
    镇压反革命全国各地大张旗鼓地进行了镇压反革命的运动，从而教育了广大的人民群众，加强了人民民主专政，巩固了抗美援朝战争的后方，保障了国家建设的进行。这是北京市各界扩大联席会议，讨论处理反革命罪犯问题。
    工业生产
    一九五一年上半年全国国营重工业部门的各种主要产品的产量总值，达预定计划的百分之一百零三，为一九五○年全年总值的百分之七十二点二，与去年同期相较则超过百分之四十四。煤的生产量比去年增加百分之二十八以上，今年上半年比去年同期增加近百分之八点九七；钢铁工业的生产去年比前年增加了四倍，今年继续有增加；电力发电量去年比前年增加百分之十四点四六以上，今年第一季又比去年同期增加百分之十七点七七。这是抚顺煤矿劳动模范张子富工作时的情形，现在他是抚顺露天矿场总工会副主任（左）和某炼钢厂外景的一角（右）。
    交通事业
    全国铁路至目前为止，已有二万二千六百多公里通车。公路比全国初解放时增加五倍。这是陇海路八号桥修复后通车的情形。
    棉粮丰收
    今年雨水状况不如去年，但农业收成仍比去年好。粮食比去年增加百分之八以上；棉花产量可创历史纪录。
    灾荒也比去年轻，今年受灾面积四千万亩，比去年减少了三千万亩，比前年减少了八千万亩。这是我国主要产棉区陕西关中泾阳棉花丰收，妇女互助组在田间拾棉的情形（左）和河南省伊川县吕店镇农民丰收谷子的情形（右）。
    农民经过土地改革翻身以后，普遍要求学习文化。目前全国入冬学的农民达二千五百万人以上，入常年民校的农民达一千万人以上。这是河北定县翟城村农民参加冬学学习时的读报情形。
    文化教育
    全国工人受教育的人数已有了显著的增加，参加业余学校的工人达一百七十万人以上。这是旅大工人正在文化补习学校学习的情形。
    根治淮河
    根据毛主席指示进行的根治淮河第一年工程，已在汛期以前胜利完成，保证了淮河流域今年夏秋二季的丰收，显示出淮河全部工程计划完成后，淮河流域的无限美好的远景。这是淮河润河集分水闸建筑工程中的模范人物：特等功臣民工谢洪友（历）一等工臣民工李秀英（中）一等功臣铁路工人王长惠。（左）
    中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，从去年十月二十五日到今年九月五日，共歼灭敌人三十万二千余人，其中美军及英、法、土等军占十四万人以上，并击落击伤美机一千五百七十八架。这是将被俘的敌军俘虏押送到后方去的情形。
    抗美援朝
    轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝斗争，已取得了伟大的胜利，把侵至鸭绿江附近的敌人赶回到三八线附近，并迫使敌人接受了停战谈判。这是人民志愿军某部指战员正在庄严地宣誓，坚决把美国侵略者消灭在朝鲜。
