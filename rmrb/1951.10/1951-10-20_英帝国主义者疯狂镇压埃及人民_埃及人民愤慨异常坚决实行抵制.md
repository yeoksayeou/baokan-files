Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: After Egypt abolished the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan, the British government announced that it would continue to maintain the "rights" given to it by the above-mentioned treaties and agreements, and frantically used force to suppress the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist movement. The British Foreign Office openly announced on the evening of the 16th that Britain would send reinforcements to the Suez Canal area. United Press International reported that on the same day, in several cities in Egypt, all British troops were dispatched to suppress the people's demonstrations. "At least eleven" Egyptians were shot dead by British troops, and "more than one hundred people were injured." The brutality of the British army "has spread from Ismailia in the Suez Canal area to Port Said and Alexandria." Erskine, the commander-in-chief of the British army in Egypt, also broadcast orders on the military radio station ordering his troops to carry out "violent" suppression.

The intimidation and atrocities of British imperialism aroused even greater indignation among the Egyptian people. On the 17th, the day after the British army shot and killed demonstrating Egyptian people, people in Cairo, Alexandria, and other places held anti-imperialist demonstrations.

Egyptian police, ordered to disperse the marching crowds in Ismailia Square and other places, shouted "Down with British imperialism!" along with their compatriots.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Egyptian workers, staff, and transportation and customs departments have taken actions to boycott the British occupiers. According to TASS, Cairo, 18th dispatch: The Port Said reporter for the Egyptian Al-Ahram newspaper reported that the Port Said railway station administration did not allow 83 British officers and soldiers disembarking from the oil tankers Lancashire and Cameronia to travel by train from Port Said to Fayid. The station administration told the British officers that the Egyptian parliament had abolished the 1936 treaty and that they had decided not to serve the British.

The newspaper's Suez reporter reported that the cargo ship Suez Star, carrying 3,300 tons of military supplies, arrived in the Gulf of Suez. Pilots, dockworkers, and signalmen refused to serve the ship, and it failed to enter the port.

Al-Ahram also reported that Egyptian workers and staff in British military camps have stopped their work. The newspaper wrote that in Tel el Kebir, over 4,000 workers held a meeting and passed a resolution to boycott the British occupiers.

According to Al Misri newspaper: The Egyptian Minister of Communications issued a decision on the 16th, pointing out that in accordance with the decrees passed by the parliament, all departments of the Ministry of Communications must immediately take measures to stop all privileges granted to the Egyptian British army by the various agencies of the Ministry of Communications, and stop serving them.

The newspaper then pointed out: The National Telegraph Bureau Employees Union passed a resolution stating that from October 17th, telegraph bureau staff will not serve the British army.

The Director-General of Egyptian Customs ordered all customs offices to deprive the British army of all privileges enjoyed under the now-abolished Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.

    埃及人民愤慨异常坚决实行抵制
    【新华社十九日讯】在埃及废除英埃条约和英埃共管苏丹的协定之后，英国政府宣布它将继续保持上述条约和协定所给它的“权利”，并疯狂地用武力镇压埃及人民的反帝运动。英国外交部十六日晚公然宣布，英国将派遣增援部队赴苏彝士运河区。合众社消息说：同日，在埃及的若干城市中，所有的英国军队均出动镇压示威游行的人民。“至少有十一个”埃及人被英军击毙，“有一百多人受伤”。英军的暴行“已由苏彝士运河区的伊士美利亚蔓延到塞得港和亚历山大港。”英国驻埃及军总司令欧斯金并在军中电台广播命令他的军队实行“猛烈”镇压。
    英帝国主义的恫吓和暴行激起了埃及人民更大的愤慨。在英国军队枪杀游行的埃及人民的第二天——十七日，开罗、亚历山大以及其他地方的人民都举行了反帝示威游行。
    奉令驱散伊士美利亚广场和其他地方的游行队伍的埃及警察，和他们的同胞一起高呼“打倒英帝国主义！”
    【新华社十九日讯】埃及工人、职员、以及交通和海关部门采取行动，抵制英国占领者。据塔斯社开罗十八日讯：埃及金字塔报驻塞得港记者报道，塞得港火车站行政当局不许从兰开夏号和卡默隆尼亚号油船上岸的八十三名英国官兵从塞得港乘火车到法依德去。车站行政当局告英国军官说，埃及议会已废除一九三六年的条约，并且他们已决定不为英国人服务。
    该报驻苏彝士记者报道，苏彝士之星号货船装载三千三百吨军用物资到达苏彝士湾，领港、码头工人以及信号人员拒绝为该船服务，该船未能驶进港内。
    金字塔报并报道，英国军营中的埃及工人和职员已停止他们的工作。该报写道，在特勒、厄尔、凯比尔，四千多名工人举行集会，通过抵制英国占领者的决定。
    据埃及人报说：埃及交通大臣十六日发表一项决定指出，遵照议会所通过的法令，交通部的各部门必须立即采取措施，停止交通部各机构给予埃及英军的一切特权，并停止替他们服务。
    该报接着指出：国家电报局雇员工会通过决定说，电报局工作人员自十月十七日起将不为英军服务。
    埃及海关总署署长命令各海关剥夺英军根据现已废止的英埃条约所享有的一切特权。
