    Workers in Jilin and Meihekou Railway Sub-bureaus Propose Production Increase and Economy Plans
    To the Editor:
    The Tian Zhonglin team, a railway labor model from the Yingcheng First Track Maintenance Section of the Jilin Sub-bureau of the Jilin Railway Administration, enthusiastically responded to the patriotic call for increased production and economy by Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Central Railway Ministry. All workers in the team unanimously realized that only by increasing production and saving expenses can we further consolidate national defense, develop production, and strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea. On the basis of doing a good job in the track maintenance contract system, economic accounting system, and ensuring the acceleration of vehicle turnaround, the team put forward three patriotic production increase plans and proposed a friendship competition to all track maintenance sections in Northeast China.
    In order to respond to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, all the workers of the Mei-Shen Line Dispatch Station (dispatch station between Meihekou and Shenyang) of the Meihekou Sub-bureau of the Jilin Railway Administration studied ways to overcome the difficulty of insufficient vehicles in early October and put forward a guarantee plan. They not only guarantee the completion of transportation tasks, but also have established five specific plans to increase production and save 3.1 billion yuan for the country.

    吉林、梅河口铁路分局工人纷纷提出增产节约计划编辑同志：
    吉林铁路管理局吉林分局营城第一养路工区铁路劳动模范田忠林小组，热烈响应东北人民政府高岗主席、中央铁道部滕代远部长的爱国增产节约的号召。全组工人一致认识到只有增加生产、节省经费，才能进一步巩固国防，发展生产，加强抗美援朝的力量。全组在作好养路包工制、经济核算制和保证加速车辆周转的基础上，提出三项爱国增产计划，并向全东北铁路各工区提出友谊竞赛。
    吉林铁路管理局梅河口分局调度所梅沈台（梅河口沈阳间调度台）全体工人为了响应增产节约的号召，于十月上旬研究克服车辆不够的困难的办法，提出了保证计划。他们不仅保证完成运输任务，并且已订立了五项具体计划，要为国家增产节约三十一亿元。
