"If Native Products Move, All Industries Flourish"
    ——An Introduction to the Mountain Dried and Fresh Goods Pavilion at the North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition

    North China is extremely rich in mountain dried and fresh goods. The Mountain Dried and Fresh Goods Pavilion at the North China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition displays only a portion of the products with greater economic exchange value. The mountain dried goods section includes: peppercorns, sunflower seeds, walnuts, almonds, black dates, red dates, black and white melon seeds, mushrooms, etc.; the fresh fruit section includes: pears, apples, chestnuts, grapes, persimmons, etc.; the vegetable section includes: garlic, cabbage, chili peppers, etc. Among them are walnuts, chestnuts, and Chinese hawthorns, which account for the world's largest production; and red dates, black dates, peppercorns, almonds, pears, garlic, and cabbage, which account for the country's largest production. China's walnut kernels are first in the world in both production and quality; China is the hometown of chestnuts, and the Chinese people began planting chestnuts three thousand years ago. Cabbage is also one of the specialties of North China, and a large quantity is shipped to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia every year. Others, such as the Yali pears of Boz鎮 in Hebei, the garlic of Baxian and Yongnian in Hebei, and the red dates of Cangxian in Hebei, are not only famous throughout the country, but also enjoy a reputation in the international market. From this perspective, we can also see how rich our motherland is in products.

    Delivering a Head-On Blow to the US Imperialist "Blockade" Conspiracy

    Since last year, US imperialism has stepped up its so-called "economic blockade" against us, attempting to use this shameless means to suffocate our foreign trade and undermine our economic construction. However, the conspiracy of US imperialism was quickly shattered by us. Between the year before last and last year, some native products in North China did experience a period of sluggish sales due to reduced exports and other reasons. Soon, thanks to the establishment of trade relations between our country and the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, especially the restoration of national transportation and the improvement of people's lives, native products in North China found new and broader markets at home and abroad. For example, walnut kernels produced in North China were always exported to capitalist countries in the past. The year before last, due to the US imperialist "blockade," they once experienced sluggish sales. At the beginning of last year, due to the opening of domestic sales markets in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places, and the opening of trade with the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, sales rapidly expanded, and the export volume has exceeded the level of 1936. Now, the walnut kernels produced in our country are no longer sluggish in sales, but are in short supply. Sunflower seeds are also the same. When sales were sluggish the year before last, one catty only sold for 400 yuan, which was barely enough to cover production costs. Now, domestic and foreign sales channels have been opened, and we can sell as much as we can produce. North China plans to increase production fivefold this year, and it is estimated that it still cannot fully meet the needs. The peppercorns produced in North China are also in short supply. There are two reasons for this: first, after liberation, especially after the land reform, people's living standards have improved, and more people are eating meat, so peppercorns are selling well; second, transportation is smooth, and they can be sold throughout the country. When peppercorns were sluggish in sales last spring, one catty only sold for 3,600 yuan, but now it has risen to 20,000 yuan. The enthusiasm for production among farmers planting peppercorns in Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan has been unprecedentedly heightened. Last year, the output of peppercorns was about 55% of that before the Anti-Japanese War, and this year it is planned to restore and exceed the level before the Anti-Japanese War. All the exhibits in the Mountain Dried and Fresh Goods Pavilion, except for bitter almonds which are still temporarily sluggish in sales (but not seriously), have no more sluggish goods (in individual areas, due to inconvenient transportation or other special reasons, there are some products with sluggish sales, which is unavoidable). Entering the Mountain Dried and Fresh Goods Pavilion, one can see large slogans of "Promoting Increased Production" everywhere, fully demonstrating the great achievements of carrying out native product exchange work in the past two years, and strengthening the audience's confidence in thoroughly crushing the blockade of US imperialism.

    "If Native Products Move, All Industries Flourish"

    Promoting the sales of native products has a very important effect on promoting national economic prosperity and developing industrial and agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of native products in the entire North China region, excluding economic crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and peanuts, is equivalent to about 7 billion catties of unprocessed grain, exceeding the total amount of public grain in North China last year. These native products have basically been sold out. The sale of native products has increased a considerable income for farmers, and the purchasing power of farmers has greatly increased. According to a survey of four key villages in Yutian County, Hebei Province, from last winter to now, farmers have used the income from selling native products and surplus grain and cotton to add a total of 220 head of livestock and more than 1,900 pieces of agricultural implements; farmers in Qilizhai, Tianzhuang, and Hanlinzhuang villages in Huairen County, Chahar Province, sold six kinds of native products in the first half of this year, earning more than 81 million yuan, all of which was used to buy cloth, agricultural implements, and livestock.

    As the purchasing power of farmers has increased, the industrial and commercial sectors have also prospered. The business volume of Beijing in the first quarter of this year increased by more than 80% compared with the same period last year; the supply of cloth by state-owned companies in Shijiazhuang this year increased by 74% compared with last year, and the supply of daily necessities increased by 46%; in the cities and towns under the jurisdiction of the four special districts in Hebei Province, the number of industrial and commercial households increased by 750. "If native products move, all industries flourish." The entire North China market has seen a rare prosperous scene in the off-season.

    Striving for Greater Victory

    Generally speaking, the problem of sluggish sales of mountain dried and fresh goods and other native products in North China has been basically resolved. The question now is: how to further guide the production of native products through sales promotion. At present, the specifications of many native products in North China are still very chaotic, and processing, transportation, and sales are not scientific enough, which affects the quality and increases transportation costs and costs. In the future, it is necessary to encourage farmers to vigorously increase the production of fast-selling native products under the principle of "not competing with cotton and grain for land"; pay attention to the promotion of fine varieties; unify specifications; and improve packaging. Achieve simultaneous progress in both quantity and quality.

    This year, some areas in North China have suffered from droughts and insect pests, and agricultural production has been reduced. Farmers in these areas are more eager to sell their native products to prepare for famine relief, and the task of promoting native products is even more arduous. We must redouble our efforts to expand the exchange of native products, promote the prosperity of urban and rural economy, and further consolidate the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance.

    “土产一动，百业俱兴”
    ——华北区城乡物资交流展览大会山干鲜货馆介绍
    华北山干鲜货出产至为富饶。华北城乡物资交流展览会山干鲜货馆展览的，只是部分较具经济交流价值的产品。山干货部分包括：花椒、葵花子、核桃仁、杏仁、乌枣、红枣、黑白瓜子、蘑菇等；鲜果部分包括：梨、苹果、栗子、葡萄、柿子等；菜蔬部分包括：大蒜、白菜、辣椒等。其中有占世界产量第一位的核桃仁、栗子、红果；有占全国产量第一位的红枣、乌枣、花椒、杏仁、梨、大蒜和白菜。我国核桃仁的产量、质量都是世界第一；我国是栗子的故乡，三千年前，我国人民就开始种栗子了。白菜也是华北的特产之一，每年运销香港、南洋，数量很大。其他如河北泊镇的鸭梨，河北霸县、永年的大蒜，河北沧县的红枣，不仅全国闻名，在国际市场上也著有声誉。从这一角度，也可看出我们祖国的物产多么富饶。给美帝国主义的“封锁”阴谋
    迎头一棒
    从去年起，美帝国主义加紧对我实行所谓“经济封锁”，企图用这种无耻手段，窒息我国的对外贸易，破坏我国的经济建设。但是，美帝国主义的阴谋，很快就被我们粉碎了。在前年去年之间，华北部分土产因为出口减少，加上其他原因，确曾一度滞销。不久，由于我国和苏联及新民主主义国家建立了贸易关系，特别是全国交通恢复，人民生活提高，华北的土产就在国内和国外找到了新的更加广阔的市场。例如：华北出产的核桃仁，过去一向输往资本主义国家，前年由于美帝国主义“封锁”，曾经一度滞销；去年年初，由于开辟了广州、上海等内销市场，并开辟了对苏联及新民主主义国家的贸易，销路迅速扩展，出口数量已经超过一九三六年的水平。现在我国所产核桃仁，已经不是滞销，而是供不应求了。葵花子也是一样，前年滞销时，一斤只卖四百元，几乎不够生产成本。现在，国内外销路都已打开，能够生产多少，可以卖出多少。华北区今年计划增产五倍，估计还不能完全满足需要。华北出产的花椒，现在也是供不应求。这里有两个原因：第一、解放以后，特别是土地改革以后，人民生活提高，吃肉的人增多，花椒因而畅销；第二、交通畅达，能销至全国。去年春季花椒滞销时，一斤只卖三千六百元，现在已经上提到两万元。河北、山西、平原种植花椒的农民，生产情绪空前提高。去年花椒产量约等于抗日战争前的百分之五十五，今年计划恢复并超过抗日战争前的水平。整个山干鲜货馆的展览品，除苦杏仁仍暂时滞销（但也不严重）外，再没有滞销的东西了（个别地区因交通不便或其他特殊原因，有部分产品滞销，或所难免）。进入山干鲜货馆，到处可以看到“提倡增产”的大字标语，充分显示了两年来开展土产交流工作的伟大成就，加强了观众彻底粉碎美帝国主义封锁的信心。“土产一动，百业俱兴”
    推销土产，对于繁荣国家经济，发展工农业生产，实有极重大的作用。据不完全统计：华北全区土产，除棉花、烤烟、花生等经济农作物外，总值约合七十亿斤原粮，超过去年全年华北全部的公粮数字。这些土产基本上已经销清。土产出售，给农民增加了一笔很可观的收入，农民的购买力大为提高。根据河北省玉田县四个基点村调查，从去年冬季到现在，农民用销出土产及余粮余棉的收入，共增添了二百二十头牲口，一千九百多件农具；察哈尔省怀仁县七里寨、田庄、韩林庄三个村农民，今年上半年推销了六种土产，收入八千一百余万元，全部买了布匹、农具和牲口。
    农民购买力提高了，工商界随之繁荣了。北京市今年第一季度营业较去年同季增加百分之八十多；石家庄国营公司今年布匹供给量较去年增加百分之七十四，日用百货增加百分之四十六；河北省四个专区所辖市镇，工商业增加了七百五十户。“土产一动，百业俱兴”，整个华北市场，出现了淡季不淡的罕有的繁荣气象。争取更大的胜利
    总的说来，华北山干鲜货等土产滞销的问题，基本上已经解决了。今后的问题是：如何进一步通过推销，来指导土产的生产。目前华北许多土产，规格仍很紊乱，加工运销不够科学，以致影响了质量，增加了运费和成本。今后必须鼓励农民，在“不与棉粮争地”的原则下，大力增产畅销土产；注意推广优良品种；统一规格；改善包装。做到产量、质量同时并进。
    今年华北部分地区遭受旱灾、虫灾，农产歉收，这些地区的农民更迫切需要把土产推销出去，以备度荒，推销土产的任务就更加繁重了。必须加倍努力，扩大土产交流，繁荣城乡经济，进一步巩固工农联盟的基础。
