Brief Comment on Political and Legal Work

Judicial Cadres Must Seriously Handle Marriage Cases

The serious errors of some judicial cadres in delaying decisions, forcing conciliation, and leniently sentencing serious crimes in handling marriage cases have become a major obstacle to the implementation of the Marriage Law.

Some people believe that the delay in handling marriage cases is merely a matter of work style. This is clearly incorrect. In fact, the reason why some judicial cadres delay the handling of marriage cases is that they disregard the interests of women and are not concerned about the suffering of women. Therefore, they do not consider the serious consequences that may be caused by delaying the handling of marriage cases. In some places, judicial personnel have delayed marriage cases to an intolerable degree; in some places, a case is delayed for several years without being processed; in others, it takes two months from the receipt of the case to the start of processing. The delay in deciding marriage cases has made those who interfere with freedom of marriage even more unscrupulous, and women oppressed by the feudal marriage system have become pessimistic and disappointed because they feel that no one supports them, and some have even committed suicide as a result. This has spread the influence of distinguishing right from wrong among the masses and suppressed the enthusiasm of the masses to oppose the feudal marriage system.

Among judicial cadres, forced conciliation of marriage disputes is not yet a widespread phenomenon, but it deserves close attention. It is right to take a cautious attitude and conduct necessary conciliation for marriage cases, especially divorce cases; however, forced conciliation is completely wrong. This principle is easy to understand; however, some judicial cadres have made mistakes in this regard. Some judicial cadres have even absurdly suggested to women seeking divorce that "they reconcile with their husbands within one year, otherwise they will be sentenced to one year in prison." This is a violation of the Marriage Law. Some judicial cadres have already caused tragic consequences of poisoning deaths due to forced conciliation. This error must be corrected immediately, and it must never be allowed to happen again.

The phenomenon of lenient sentencing for serious crimes is serious. For example, Wang Guozhen of Pillow Village, Linfen County, Shanxi Province, who killed his daughter-in-law and two other people, was only sentenced to seven months in prison. In Linyi County, Shandong Province, a criminal who poisoned his wife was released home. There are many reasons for lenient sentencing, many of which are due to a one-sided understanding of the Marriage Law by judicial cadres. Some people feel that marriage disputes are internal affairs of the people, which are different from counter-revolutionary cases, which is correct; however, we must not therefore take a lenient attitude towards the criminals involved. Article 26 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Whoever causes the death or injury of the interfered person due to interference with freedom of marriage shall bear criminal responsibility." However, many judicial cadres have not earnestly acted in accordance with the Marriage Law. As a result, many criminals who killed or injured women or forced women to commit suicide have not been severely punished. This actually protects the remnants of the feudal marriage system, which cannot educate the masses and prevent crimes through the punishment of criminals, and cannot effectively implement the Marriage Law. Therefore, we suggest that the relevant judicial leading organs should re-examine all wrongly handled marriage cases. Judicial cadres who have neglected their duties must be strictly criticized and asked to make serious self-criticism, and the situation should be made public among the masses or cadres as appropriate. Those whose circumstances are serious must be given appropriate punishment in order to uphold the discipline of the People's Government.

    政法工作简评
    司法工作干部必须严肃地处理婚姻案件
    一部分司法工作干部在处理婚姻案件中的拖延不决、强制调解、重罪轻判的严重错误行为，已成为贯彻婚姻法的极大障碍。
    对于婚姻案件的拖延不决，有人曾认为这只是工作作风问题。这显然是不够正确的。实际上，一部分司法工作干部之所以拖延处理婚姻案件，乃是因为他们漠视妇女利益，不关心妇女疾苦，因而他们也就不去考虑拖延处理婚姻案件可能引起的严重后果。某些地方的司法人员拖延婚姻案件达到了令人不能容忍的程度；有的地方，一件案子拖延几年不作处理；有的从收案到开始处理就拖两个月。对婚姻案件的拖延不决曾使得干涉婚姻自由的人更加肆无忌惮，受封建婚姻制度压迫的妇女则因感到无人支持而悲观失望，甚至因此自杀。这就在群众中散布了是非不分的影响，压抑了群众反对封建婚姻制度的积极性。
    在司法工作干部中，强制调解婚姻纠纷虽然还不是大量普遍的现象，但值得密切注意。对于婚姻案件特别是离婚案件，采取慎重的态度，进行必要的调解是对的；但是，强制调解则是完全错误的。这个道理是很容易了解的；但是有些司法工作干部却恰恰在这方面犯了错误。甚至有的司法工作干部对要求离婚的妇女，荒谬地提出“在一年内和丈夫和好，否则判一年徒刑”。这是违反婚姻法的行为。有的司法工作干部已经因为强制调解造成了毒死人命惨案的恶果。这种错误必须立即纠正，决不能再让它发生。
    重罪轻判的现象是严重的。如山西省临汾县枕头村王国振害死儿媳等三条人命，只被判七个月的徒刑。山东省临邑县竟将毒死妻子的罪犯释放回家。重罪轻判的原因有不少是由于司法工作干部对婚姻法的片面了解。有些人觉得婚姻纠纷是人民内部的事，不同于反革命案件，这是对的；但是决不能因此而对有关的罪犯采取轻恕的态度。中华人民共和国婚姻法第二十六条规定了：“凡因干涉婚姻自由而引起被干涉者的死亡或伤害者，干涉者一律应并负刑事的责任。”但是，不少司法工作干部并没有认真按照婚姻法办事，结果杀死杀伤妇女或逼迫妇女自杀的许多罪犯没有受到严厉的制裁。这就在实际上保护了封建婚姻制度的残余，这就不能通过对犯罪分子的惩处，来教育群众，并防止犯罪，也就不能有效地贯彻执行婚姻法。因此，我们建议有关的司法领导机关，对所有处理错误的婚姻案件，均应做重新处理。对于失职的司法工作干部则必须进行严格的批评，请他们认真检讨，并斟酌情形在群众中或干部中公布。对于情节重大的，必须予以适当处分，以严肃人民政府的法纪。
