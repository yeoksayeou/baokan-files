Relying on the Masses to Overcome Disasters
    —An Introduction to the Overcoming Disasters Pavilion at the North China Region Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition
    Huang Chenming
    The Overcoming Disasters Pavilion at the North China Region Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition showcases the achievements of the people of North China in their struggle against disasters over the past few years. It summarizes the experiences of the people of North China in overcoming disasters, powerfully inspiring the idea of "relying on the masses, man can conquer nature."
    The pavilion prominently and systematically exhibits the glorious achievements of the people of North China in harnessing the Yellow River. The Yellow River in Pingyuan Province has always been known as the "tofu waist." During the more than twenty years of Kuomintang rule, the Yellow River breached its banks one hundred and six times, with 70 percent of these occurring in Pingyuan Province. However, since 1946, thanks to the heroic struggle of the people of North China, mainly in Pingyuan Province, the Yellow River has not breached its banks even once in six years.
    The struggle of the people in the North China liberated areas to prevent flooding from the Yellow River was integrated with the struggle against the Kuomintang bandit gang. From the large oil paintings here, people can see the crimes of the US-Chiang bandit gang, who, in order to coordinate their military operations, violated the agreement in March 1947 by blocking the Huayuankou breach and diverting the water back to its old course, causing suffering to one million people in the original riverbed. They can also see how the people at that time angrily raised the banner of "defeating Chiang and the Yellow River" and engaged in a heroic struggle. Charts illustrate that the US-Chiang bandit gang constantly carried out armed sabotage against the Yellow River control projects in the liberated areas, attempting to flood the liberated areas. For example, in July 1948, the Yellow River floodwaters in the Gaocun area of Dongming County surged, and the situation was critical. However, the US-Chiang bandit gang sent planes to indiscriminately bomb the construction site, averaging more than ten times each night, in order to disrupt the rescue work. It was in this treacherous environment that the people of Pingyuan Province held a gun in one hand and tools in the other, protecting the Yellow River from breaching its banks. In three years, a total of 15.45 million cubic meters of earthwork was completed, mobilizing 10.12 million laborers, of whom more than 800 cadres and masses gloriously sacrificed their lives.
    In 1949, the Yellow River experienced a flood unseen in decades, but after the arduous struggle of the cadres, laborers, and the broad masses of Pingyuan Province, it was finally overcome. In 1950, the People's Government implemented a policy of combining dike repair with disaster relief, helping 310,000 disaster victims overcome the spring famine. This year, Changyuan County in Pingyuan Province built an overflow weir to ensure that the dikes would not collapse in the event of an exceptional flood. At the same time, the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project to benefit the Wei River was also launched, which will be completed in two years. Once this project is completed, it will not only irrigate 360,000 mu of land, but also allow 200-ton steamers to travel along the Wei River between Tianjin and Xinxiang. Through these facts, it can be said that the transformation of the Yellow River from a millennium-old scourge to a beneficial river has had a good start. The pavilion also displays a model of a distant view of the Yellow River, illustrating that the people's Yellow River has unlimited bright prospects.
    In the past six years, the people of Pingyuan Province have used a total of 47.91 million cubic meters of earth in managing the Yellow River and repairing dikes. The dikes in the Dong'e area are 3.8 times larger than they were under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang; those in the Changyuan area are 7.3 times larger. The highest investment in "Yellow River management" by the Kuomintang reactionary government in one year (1943) was only equivalent to 52.5 million jin of millet, while the People's Government's investment in Yellow River management this year is 500 million jin of millet, with 320 million jin of millet from Pingyuan Province alone.
    In the Yellow River management project, the broad masses of farmers demonstrated a high degree of political awareness and creativity. In 1951 alone, 700,000 laborers in Pingyuan Province completed 22.25 million cubic meters of earthwork on 963 kilometers of dikes. They continuously improved tools and working methods, and created the technique of using "high rammers for flat surfaces and offset rammers for edges" in ramming. They organized themselves and implemented a reasonable wage policy of calculating work by "cubic meters" and distributing bonuses by "points," implementing the principle of "to each according to his work, more work more pay." They enthusiastically launched patriotic work competitions, formulated patriotic pledges, and produced a large number of model male and female laborers and model earthwork teams. This year, the average work efficiency per worker was 3.7 cubic meters, more than three times higher than during the Kuomintang rule. Labor model Song Bing pushed 54 cubic meters of earth in one day. Charts illustrate that 54 cubic meters of earth, if loaded with 20-ton train cars, would require five cars.
    In the struggle against floods, other areas of North China have also made great achievements. In Hebei Province, the area affected by floods in 1949 accounted for 18 percent of the total area, which decreased to 8 percent in 1950, and further decreased to 2 percent in 1951. Where do these achievements come from? Charts point out that 2.45 million laborers were used for river management in 1949, 11.25 million laborers in 1950, and 14 million laborers in 1951. This is the reason for the achievements.
    The fact that the People's Air Force bombed the ice dam in Houtao, Suiyuan this spring, saving the people along the river from disaster, is also exhibited. In addition, models and charts of the Yongding River Guanting Reservoir project, the Sanggan River siltation irrigation project, the Nanyang Lake flood control project, the Hai River silt removal project, and the independent sea-flowing project are also displayed, illustrating that North China's water conservancy construction is developing.
    The second part of the Overcoming Disasters Pavilion is the Overcoming Drought Room. North China faced a great threat of drought this year, but the people of North China mobilized and launched a large-scale drought-resistant planting campaign, finally overcoming the disaster. North China planted ×× mu of cotton this year, of which 70 to 80 percent was completed by carrying water for planting and seizing the opportunity to plant with residual moisture. These experiences of drought-resistant planting are represented by models combined with pictures. The deeds of Comrade Ma Yiqian, the National Agricultural Labor Model, who led the masses of Fengzhuang Village, Huairen County, Chahar Province, to achieve victory in drought resistance, are exhibited through a series of comic strips. People can see how they responded to Li Shunda's patriotic and high-yield competition, formulated patriotic pledges, launched a challenge to drought-resistant seedling protection, and how they organized the male and female labor force in the village to help each other dig wells, carry water to water seedlings, hoe seedlings, protect seedlings, open ditches and build frames, transforming dry land into paddy fields and alkaline land into irrigated land. Millions of North China farmers, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, achieved this year's victory in drought resistance through such tense efforts. Statistics show that 38,955 new wells were dug in North China this year, 66,603 new waterwheels were added (as of August), and more than 30 large canals and more than 4,000 medium and small canals were opened. The comprehensive results of the above-mentioned water conservancy construction expanded the irrigated area by 2,871,145 mu, increasing the output value by 158.55 million jin of millet.
    In addition, the pavilion also exhibits models of the Hutuo River irrigation area project in Shanxi, the Jieshiu artesian well project in Shanxi, the Guangli irrigation area project in Pingyuan, the Huangyangzha project in Suiyuan, and the electric water lifting irrigation project in the Bohai area. Yang Hongdong, the Suiyuan water conservancy labor model who participated in the construction of the Huangyangzha project, said after visiting: "We in Houtao (referring to the Houtao of the Yellow River) are particularly afraid of water. If the water is too high, we dare not release it, and if the water is too low, we cannot irrigate. In the past, under the reactionary rule, the people spent a lot of money to repair Huangyangzha, but it could not be repaired well in any year. With the leadership of Chairman Mao, it was repaired in three months this year."
    This year's insect pests also posed a serious threat to agricultural production in North China. In the insect pest room, charts illustrate that the area where locusts occurred this year was 5,719,000 mu, and the area where cotton aphids occurred was 26,770,000 mu. In the locust control struggle in North China, 2.7 million people and 11.118 million workdays were mobilized, and in the aphid control struggle, 4.32 million people and 67.84 million workdays were mobilized (Note: In the insect control campaign in North China, some areas were counted by workdays, and some areas were counted by people, so they are counted separately), and finally the pests were eliminated and did not become a major disaster. Looking back in history, no dynasty can find such a large-scale, led, and organized insect control struggle.
    The insect pest room also exhibits the rich experience of the people of North China in the struggle against insect pests. To deal with aphids, it is necessary to organize, use medicines such as cotton oil soap and tobacco lime water, and implement "early treatment, continuous treatment, universal treatment, and clean treatment." To deal with locusts, it is necessary to implement "fight small, fight early, fight them out"; and to take measures such as digging blockade ditches, digging head-on ditches, encircling and attacking, burning, trapping, using poisoned bait, and spraying pesticides according to different conditions. The deeds of the People's Air Force carrying out China's first aerial spraying of powder to kill locusts in Huanghua, Hebei, this summer with the assistance of Soviet experts are also exhibited through photos. In addition, specimens and control methods of pests such as red spiders, mole crickets, armyworms, borers, and twenty-eight-spotted ladybugs are also exhibited. Farmer representatives are very concerned about these methods. Qian Rugui, an agricultural labor model from Pingyuan Province, said:
    "We have aphids, grasshoppers (locusts), flower ladies (twenty-eight-spotted ladybugs), and red spiders in our area. After seeing this, I know what kind of medicine to use for each insect." A large slogan reminds people: "Prevention is more important than cure," and many specimens of weeds and pests are displayed to tell people to remove weeds, dig up insect eggs, and carry out autumn plowing.
    The disease room exhibits the pathogens, damage, and prevention methods of major diseases such as wheat bunt, wheat jaundice, and millet white hair disease. It briefly introduces excellent disease-resistant varieties such as Dingxian No. 72 and Pingyuan Youzimai, as well as seed disinfection agents such as Ceresan and copper sulfate. It also tells people in detail the importance and methods of soaking seeds, mixing seeds, and selecting seeds in order to implement the principle of prevention is better than cure. The struggle to prevent diseases in North China is also mass-based. In 1951, the sowing area of wheat, sorghum, millet, and other crops that had been soaked and mixed with seeds in Chahar Province accounted for 81 percent of the total sowing area.
    The last room of the Overcoming Disasters Pavilion is the Afforestation and Disaster Prevention Room. It points out that forests can absorb 50 percent of rainfall, greatly reduce the flow rate of rainwater, conserve water sources, prevent floods, prevent landslides, eliminate sandy wastelands, and regulate the climate. Therefore, afforestation is a fundamental way to prevent floods, droughts, and wind disasters. The model of "Opening Heshan Mountain, floating rice-grain rivers" gives people a deep impression. Heshan Mountain is in Shanxi and is the source of the Qingzhang River. Before the war, the mountains were full of forests, and the water flowed into rivers. The river fields on both sides used river water for irrigation, and there was a bumper harvest every year. People called it "Rice-Grain River." However, after the destruction of the Japanese invaders and the blind reclamation of the masses, Heshan Mountain became a bald mountain. Whenever there was heavy rain, mountain floods broke out, and the river overflowed. Later, all the farmland was submerged, most of the houses were destroyed, and the riverbed was ten times wider than before. Rice-Grain River became a desolate beach. This fact powerfully illustrates why closing mountains for afforestation is a basic policy for developing mountain production. The room also exhibits pictures of the primitive forest in Inner Mongolia—one of China's "tree seas"—and introduces that Inner Mongolia mobilized the masses, established fire prevention organizations, and strengthened fire prevention equipment, thus achieving an 80 percent reduction in forest fires in 1951 compared to 1950.

    依靠群众，战胜灾害
    ——华北区城乡物资交流展览会战胜灾害馆介绍
    黄陈明
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会战胜灾害馆，展出几年来华北人民对灾害斗争的成绩，总结了华北人民战胜灾害的经验，有力地启发了人们“依靠群众，人定胜天”的思想。
    馆里突出地系统地展出华北人民治黄河的辉煌成就。平原省的黄河，一向有“豆腐腰”之称。在国民党统治的二十多年中，黄河决口一百零六次，其中发生在平原省者占百分之七十。但是，从一九四六年起，由于华北主要是平原省人民的英勇斗争，使得黄河六年来没有溃决一次。
    华北解放区人民防黄的斗争，是和反国民党匪帮的斗争结合在一起的。人们可以从这里的几幅大油画中，看到美蒋匪帮为了配合他们的军事行动，在一九四七年三月违约堵塞花园口，放水归故，使原河床的一百万人民遭受灾难的罪行；也可以看到当时人民怎样愤怒地举着“战胜蒋黄”的旗帜，进行英勇斗争的情形。图表说明：美蒋匪帮曾经对解放区的治黄工程，不断地进行武装破坏，企图水淹解放区。例如，一九四八年七月，东明县高村一带黄河洪水暴涨，情况危急，但美蒋匪帮竟派飞机滥炸工地，平均每夜十余次，以破坏抢险工作。就是在这种险恶的环境中，平原省人民一手拿枪，一手拿工具，保护黄河没有决口。前后三年，共完成了一千五百四十五万土方的工程，动员了一千零一十二万民工，其中干部和群众八百余人光荣牺牲。
    一九四九年，黄河发生了数十年罕有的洪水，但经过平原省干部、民工和广大群众艰苦奋斗，终于战胜了它。一九五○年，人民政府实行修堤和救灾相结合的政策，帮助三十一万灾民度过了春荒。今年平原长垣县又建筑了一条溢洪堰，以确保异常洪水发生时大堤不致溃决；同时，并举办了引黄灌溉济卫工程，此项工程，两年可全部完成。此项工程完成后，不但可以灌溉土地三十六万亩，而且二百吨汽船可经过卫河往来于天津、新乡之间。通过这些事实，可以说，黄河从千年害河变为利河的工程，已有了良好的开端。馆里还陈列着一个黄河远景的模型，说明人民的黄河是有无限光明前途的。
    六年来，平原省人民治黄、修堤，共用土四千七百九十一万公方。东阿一带大堤，比国民党反动统治时增大了三点八倍；长垣一带增大了七点三倍。国民党反动政府“治黄”投资最高的一年（一九四三年），也只折合小米五千二百五十万斤，而人民政府今年治黄投资为五亿斤小米，仅平原一省，就有三亿二千万斤小米。
    在治黄工程中，广大农民表现了高度的政治觉悟和创造力。仅在一九五一年，平原省就有七十万民工，在九百六十三公里的堤线上，完成了二千二百二十五万方土的工程。他们不断改进工具和工作方法，并创造了“高硪打坦、偏硪打边”的打硪技术。他们组织起来，实行了按“方”计工，按“分”分红的合理的工资政策，贯彻按劳取酬，多劳多得的原则。他们热火朝天地开展了爱国主义工作竞赛，订立了爱国公约，涌现出大批的模范男女民工和模范土工队。今年每工平均工作效率为三点七方，比国民党统治时期提高了三倍多。劳动模范宋炳一天推土五十四公方。图表说明：五十四公方的土，如果用二十吨的火车厢来装载，需要五节车厢。
    在和水灾作斗争中，华北其他地区也有很大成绩。河北省一九四九年水灾面积占全面积百分之十八，一九五零年减少到百分之八，一九五一年更减少到百分之二。成绩从何而来？图表指出：为了治河，一九四九年用人工二百四十五万个，一九五零年用人工一千一百二十五万个，一九五一年用人工一千四百万个。这就是取得成绩的原因。
    今春人民空军炸开绥远后套冰坝，挽救了沿河人民，没有遭受灾害，这一具体事实也展出了。此外，还展出了永定河官厅水库工程、桑乾河淤灌工程、南阳湖防洪工程、海河放淤工程、独流入海工程等模型和图表，说明了华北的水利建设事业在发展中。
    战胜灾害馆的第二部分，是战胜旱灾室。华北今年旱灾威胁很大，但华北人民动员起来，展开了大规模的抗旱点种运动，终于战胜了灾害。华北今年植棉××万亩，其中百分之七、八十是担水点种和借墒抢种完成的。这些抗旱播种的经验，都用模型结合图画表示出来。全国农业劳动模范马益谦同志，领导察哈尔省怀仁县冯庄村群众，取得抗旱胜利的事迹，是通过一系列的连环图画展出的。人们可以看到他们怎样响应李顺达爱国丰产竞赛，订立爱国公约。进行抗旱保苗的挑战，怎样把村里的男女劳动力组织起来，互助挖井，担水浇苗，锄苗，保苗，开渠打框，变旱田为水田，变碱地为水地。千百万华北农民就是在党和人民政府领导下，大同小异地通过这样紧张的努力而取得今年抗旱胜利的。统计今年华北打新井三万八千九百五十五眼，新添水车（截到八月止）六万六千六百零三辆，开大渠道三十余处，中小渠道四千余条。上述兴修水利的综合成果，扩大灌溉面积二、八七一、一四五亩，增产值一亿五千八百五十五万斤小米。
    此外，该馆还展出了山西滹沱河灌溉区工程，山西介休自流井工程，平原广利灌溉区工程、绥远黄杨闸工程、渤海区电力扬水灌溉工程等模型。曾参加修建黄杨闸工程的绥远水利劳动模范杨宏栋参观后说：“我们后套（指黄河后套）特别怕水。水大了不敢放，水小了又浇不上。过去在反动统治下，人民为修黄杨闸花钱不少，可是哪一年也修不好。有了毛主席的领导，今年三个月的功夫就修好了。”
    今年的虫害对华北农业生产的威胁也是很严重的。在虫灾室里，图表说明：今年发生蝗虫的面积五百七十一万九千亩，发生棉蚜的面积二千六百七十七万亩。华北在灭蝗斗争中，动员了二百七十万人又一百一十一万八千个工，在治蚜斗争中，动员了四百三十二万人又六千七百八十四万个工（按：华北灭虫运动中，有些地区按工统计，有些地方按人统计，故分别统计），终于消灭了害虫，未成大害。翻开历史，任何朝代也找不到这样大规模的有领导有组织的灭虫斗争。
    虫害室并展出了华北人民对虫害斗争的丰富经验。对付蚜虫，要组织起来，用棉油皂、烟叶石灰水等药剂，实行“早治，连续治、普遍治和治干净”。对付蝗虫，要实行“打小、打早、打了”；要根据不同条件，采取挖封锁沟、挖迎头沟、围打、火烧、诱杀、用毒饵、喷药粉等办法。今夏人民空军在苏联专家协助下，在河北黄骅进行中国第
    一次飞机喷粉灭蝗的事迹，也通过照片展出了。此外，并展出了红蜘蛛、蝼蛄、行军虫、钻心虫、二十八星瓢虫等害虫标本和防治办法。农民代表十分关心这些办法。平原省农业劳动模范钱如贵说：
    “蚜虫、蚂蚱（蝗虫）、花大姐（二十八星瓢虫）、红蜘蛛，俺们那里都有。这回一看，啥虫用啥法治，可闹清了。”大幅的标语提醒人们：“防重于治”，并陈列了不少杂草和害虫的标本，告诉人们要除杂草，挖虫卵，实行秋耕。
    病害室里展出小麦黑穗病、小麦黄疸病、谷子白发病等主要病害的病原、为害情形及预防方法，扼要地介绍了定县七十二号、平原蚰子麦等耐疸的优良品种和赛力散、王铜等种子消毒药剂。并详细地告诉人们，浸种、拌种、选种的重要性和方法，以贯彻防胜于治的方针。华北防止病害的斗争也是带有群众性的，察哈尔省一九五一年经过浸种、拌种的麦类、高粱、谷子等作物播种面积，占总播种面积的百分之八十一。
    战胜灾害馆的最后一室是造林防灾室。这里指出森林能吸收降雨量百分之五十，并可大大降低雨水流速，还可以涵养水源、预防洪水、防止山崩、消灭沙荒、调节气候；因此造林是防止水旱风灾的根本办法。“开了和顺山，漂了米粮川”的一付模型，给人很深刻的印象。和顺山在山西，是清漳河的发源地。战前林木满山，水流成川，两岸河田利用河水灌溉，年年丰收。人们称它作“米粮川”。但是经过日寇破坏，加以群众盲目开荒，和顺山变成秃山。每逢大雨，山洪暴发，河水泛滥。后来农田全被淹没，房屋大部被冲毁，河身比以前宽了十倍。米粮川变成一片荒凉的沙滩。这一事实有力地说明了为什么封山育林是发展山区生产的一条基本政策。该室里还展出内蒙原始大森林——中国“树海”之一——的图片，并介绍了内蒙发动群众，设立防火组织，加强防火设备，因而获得了一九五一年森林火灾比一九五零年减少了百分之八十的成绩。（附图片）
