Hebei Provincial State-Owned Local Industries have recently completed the verification of funds and implemented independent management, laying a good foundation for the future implementation of economic accounting. A large amount of capital has been saved through the verification of funds. According to statistics from sixteen factories and mines, the planned production volume for 1951 increased by 29% compared to the previous year, but the capital occupied decreased by 23%. According to statistics from another thirteen factories and mines, the capital turnover rate has been shortened from an average of once every 188 days in the past to once every 110.9 days. Accumulated assets worth 1.6 billion (currency not specified), cleared during the capital verification process, have been invested in new industrial production.

In the autumn of 1949, dozens of factories and mines in Hebei Province's local industry were merged under the unified leadership of the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry from the former Jinnan, Jizhong, and Jidong administrative regions. At that time, the scale of each factory and mine was small, the capital was weak, the financial system was inconsistent, and the price of goods was unstable, so the policy of decentralized production, unified management, and gradual rectification was determined. In 1950, each factory and mine conducted a general inventory of property, organized factory and mine inspections, and established systems for factory and mine security, machine repair, and wage adjustments, creating preliminary conditions for economic accounting. However, in this process of unified management, most factories and mines only managed production and didn't care about profits and losses. Enterprise leaders had serious supply system ideology. Each factory and mine received raw materials and funds from higher authorities when they were lacking, making it difficult to accurately calculate profits and losses, which seriously affected the implementation of the economic accounting system. Therefore, in the second quarter of this year, the Provincial Department of Industry decided to implement independent management with factories and mines as units and verified the required amount of funds for each factory and mine.

After this verification of funds, the Provincial Department of Industry and its affiliated factories and mines gradually became more aware of the use of funds. The Department of Industry grasped the actual required amount of fixed assets and working capital for each factory and mine and determined a dedicated fund system. Each factory and mine also clearly understood where funds were wasted and accumulated. After the verification of funds and the determination of independent management, the enthusiasm of each factory and mine for production and operation has improved compared to the past. Iron factories such as Linqing and Baoding were unable to make production plans due to repairing odd jobs. After the capital was verified, these factories clarified the policy of "facing the countryside" according to market needs, appropriately increased the manufacturing of simple mechanical equipment, and made practical and feasible plans, thus enabling regular production.

The verification of funds for various factories and mines in Hebei Province's local industry this time largely mobilized workshops, teams, and workers to discuss and formulate quota plans, thus enabling the rational use of funds. Administrative leaders of the Baoding Power Plant believed that "only by storing more coal can we avoid work stoppages and power outages." However, after discussion by workshop workers, based on the city's coal purchase and transportation conditions, they unanimously proposed: "Storing less coal has many advantages, not only burning new coal and saving coal, but also having confidence when burning, and reducing the risk of natural fires during storage." These opinions were adopted by the factory leaders, allowing the coal funds to be turned over nine times a year, reducing capital occupation by 40% compared to the past. Many workshops and production teams in various factories and mines have established a capital quota system, closely linking production links and strictly implementing the material requisition and distribution system, which has greatly reduced the capital occupied during the production process. At the same time, it also corrected the erroneous thinking of factory and mine leaders in using funds with a "generous estimate." (Zeng Run)

### 河北地方工业清理资产告一段落  呆滞资金投入再生产

    河北地方工业清理资产告一段落
    呆滞资金投入再生产
    河北省营地方工业，最近普遍地核定了资金，实行了独立经营，为今后实行经济核算制打下了良好的基础。经过核定资金，节省了大量资金。据十六个厂矿统计，一九五一年较上年度计划生产量增加百分之二十九，但占用资金却减少了百分之二十三。另据十三个厂矿的统计，资金周转率已由过去平均一百八十八天周转一次，缩短到一百一十点九天周转一次。在核定资金中清理出的积压资产，合款达十六亿，已投入了新的工业生产。
    该省地方工业数十个厂矿，在一九四九年秋，由冀南、冀中、冀东等行政区合并于河北省工业厅统一领导。当时各厂矿规模较小、资金薄弱、财务制度不一，且又处在物价不稳定的情况下，就确定了分散生产、统一经营、逐渐整顿的方针。在一九五零年，各厂矿普遍地清理了财产，组织了厂矿检查，建立了厂矿保安、机器检修、工资调整等制度，为经济核算制创造了初步的条件。但在这种统一经营过程中，各厂矿多是只管生产，不管赔赚，企业领导干部，有严重的供给制思想。各厂矿缺了原料、资金，就向上级领取，很难正确地计算盈亏，严重地影响了经济核算制的实行。为此，省工业厅于本年第二季度，决定以厂矿为单位独立经营，并核定了各厂矿的资金需要数目。
    经过此次核定资金后，该省工业厅和所属厂矿，在使用资金上逐渐作到了心中有数。工业厅掌握了各厂矿实际需用固定资金和流动资金的数目，并确定了专款专用制度。各厂矿也确实了解到有那些地方浪费和积压了资金。经过核定资金，确定独立经营后，各厂矿生产与经营的积极性都较过去提高了。临清保定等铁工厂因为修理零活，不能做生产计划。资金核定后，这些工厂根据市场需要，明确了“面向农村”的方针，适当地增加简单机械器具的制造，作出了切实可行的计划，因而得以经常生产。
    河北省地方工业各厂矿此次核定资金，大部充分发动了车间、小组和工人群众，讨论和制订定额计划，因而使资金得到合理的使用。保定发电厂行政领导干部认为“只有多存煤才不会停工停电”。但经车间工人讨论，根据本市购煤与运输条件，一致提出：“少存煤好处多，不但烧新煤，节省煤，烧火时有把握，保管时还减少自然火灾的危险。”这些意见被该厂领导干部采纳了，使煤的资金全年可以周转九次，较过去占用资金减少百分之四十。各厂矿不少车间、生产小组由于建立了资金定额制度，把生产环节紧密地衔接起来，并严格执行材料领发制度，使生产过程中占用的资金也大量减少。同时，也纠正了厂矿领导干部中使用资金“宽打窄用”的错误思想。（曾润）
