In the past two years, New Year pictures have been warmly welcomed by people across the country and have played a significant role in educating the masses. However, there are still some shortcomings in the work of New Year pictures. The themes and content of some works are monotonous and poor, the images of the characters are not beautiful enough, and the output of the works is not as large as that of the old New Year pictures. The distribution has not yet penetrated into the rural areas; therefore, the new New Year pictures cannot fully meet the needs of the broad masses of the people, and the transformation of the old New Year pictures has not yet been carried out in a planned manner. In order to strengthen the work of New Year pictures, the cultural and educational and publishing administrative organs of the people's governments at all levels and the local art groups must pay attention to the following points when arranging the work of New Year pictures:

(1) Strengthen the leadership and planning of New Year picture creation. In addition to mobilizing and organizing new and old art workers to formulate creation outlines and review their drafts, the local cultural and educational authorities should formulate creation subject plans based on the local political, economic, and cultural development and the actual needs of the people, provide authors with relevant written and pictorial materials, and assist them in collecting various heroic and exemplary deeds in people's lives for creation. In areas with a large number of art workers, creation discussion meetings and first draft viewing meetings should be held. In addition, New Year picture exhibitions can be held in rural areas, factories, and troops during the Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities. Prevent the phenomenon of being divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, only caring about creation, and not caring about the effect in the work of New Year pictures.

(2) Give full play to the excellent traditions of folk New Year pictures. In terms of content, all that is related to the people's hopes and pursuits for a happy life (such as peace, longevity, many children, food and clothing), their appreciation and love for beautiful scenery and objects (such as landscapes, scenery, figures, flowers and fruits), and excellent historical stories, folk tales, and story paintings of folk operas that are familiar to the people can be appropriately retained. In terms of form, such as four-screen panels, lunar calendars, monthly calendars, central hall screens, and continuous story paintings, etc., which have always been loved by the people, should be well used and improved.

(3) Unite New Year picture artists. Transforming old New Year pictures is an important project in reforming the old cultural undertakings. Uniting folk New Year picture artists and organizing them to conduct political study and professional study is an important prerequisite for transforming old New Year pictures. In areas with a large number of New Year picture artists, the cultural and educational authorities should hold short-term study classes for New Year picture artists. In addition, it is necessary to organize new art workers to cooperate with New Year picture artists, attach importance to the original skills of New Year picture artists, provide them with new themes and materials, and provide them with practical and patient assistance in creation.

(4) Overcome the chaotic phenomenon in the publication of New Year pictures. Among the New Year pictures published last year, many old New Year pictures with wrong and harmful content are still being reprinted and distributed, which has a bad impact on the broad masses of the people. In areas with a large number of New Year picture publishing enterprises (such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Weixian County of Shandong Province, etc.), the cultural and educational authorities and publishing administrative organs should conduct a thorough investigation of the publication of New Year pictures, convene a meeting of New Year picture publishers, explain the relationship between the publication of New Year pictures and the interests of the broad masses of the people, adjust their publishing plans, and help them review the old drafts and organize new drafts. For New Year pictures with wrong content, publishers should be advised to make revisions; for New Year pictures with reactionary and harmful content, publication should be prohibited.

(5) Improve the distribution methods of New Year pictures. New Year pictures can only reach the broad masses of the people through good distribution. According to past experience, except for a few areas that can use the distribution methods of folk New Year pictures or create new distribution methods, they are generally only sold in bookstores in cities and towns, and have not been able to penetrate into the vast rural areas. In the future, we should pay attention to adopting various methods to achieve the goal that every household can buy New Year pictures.

    关于加强年画工作的指示
    两年以来，新年画在全国人民中已受到热烈的欢迎，在教育群众上起了很大作用。但在年画工作中仍存在着若干缺点，有些作品的题材内容单调贫乏，人物形象不够美丽，作品的产量尚不及旧年画多，发行尚未深入农村；因此新年画还不能完全满足广大人民的需要，而旧年画的改造又尚未有计划地进行。为加强年画工作，各级人民政府文教、出版行政机关及各地美术团体在布置年画工作时，务须注意以下各点：
    （一）加强年画创作的领导与计划性。各地文教主管部门，除动员和组织新旧美术工作者制定创作提纲和审查他们的画稿外，应根据本地区的政治经济文化发展情况和人民的实际需要，制订创作题材计划，向作者提供有关的文字和图片资料，并协助其搜集人民生活中各种英雄模范事迹，以进行创作。在美术工作者较多的地区，应召集创作讨论会与作品初稿观摩会。此外，并可利用春节文化娱乐活动期间，在农村、工厂、部队中举办年画展览。防止年画工作中脱离群众、脱离实际、只顾创作、不问效果的现象。
    （二）充分利用与发挥民间年画的优良传统。在内容方面，凡有关人民对于幸福生活的希望与追求（如平安、长寿、多儿女、丰衣足食之类），对于美好风物的欣赏与爱好（如山水、风景、人物、花果之类），以及为人民所熟悉的优秀历史故事、民间传说、民间戏曲的故事画等等，都可以适当地加以保留。在形式方面，诸如四扇屏、农历图、月份牌、中堂屏幅及连续故事画等等，一向为人民所喜爱，应该很好地运用与改进。
    （三）团结年画艺人。改造旧年画是改革旧有文化事业中一个重要的项目。团结民间年画艺人并组织他们进行政治学习和业务学习，又是改造旧年画的重要前提。在年画艺人较多的地区，文教主管机关应举办年画艺人短期学习班。此外，必须组织新的美术工作者与年画艺人合作，重视年画艺人的原有技术，供给他们新的题材和资料，并在创作上对他们作切实和耐心的帮助。
    （四）克服年画出版工作中的混乱现象。去年出版的年画中，不少内容错误和有害的旧年画尚在继续翻印发行，对广大群众产生不良影响。在年画出版事业较多的地区（如上海、天津、山东潍县等处），文教主管部门及出版行政机关应切实调查年画出版情况，召开年画出版工作者的会议，说明年画出版工作对于广大人民的利害关系，调整他们的出版计划，帮助他们审订旧的画稿和组织新的画稿。对于内容错误的年画，应劝告出版商进行修改；对于内容反动和有害的年画，应禁止出版。
    （五）改进年画的发行方法。年画只有经过良好的发行才能到达广大人民手中，根据过去情况，除了少数地区能运用民间年画的发行方式或创造新的发行方式外，一般尚只在城镇的书店门市发售，未能深入广大农村。今后应注意采用各种方法，以达到家家户户都能买到新年画的目的。中央人民政府文化部部长    沈雁冰出版总署署长    胡愈之一九五一年十月二十日
