The Yixing People's Court Seriously Handles Marriage Cases
Criticizes Irresponsible District and Township Cadres
Irresponsible Cadres Should Submit a Self-Criticism Report for Public Announcement

In the Dingshan District, Maocun Township, and Zhoushu Township of Yixing County, Southern Jiangsu Province, some district and township cadres have feudalistic ideas and were slow to provide a satisfactory response to the divorce request submitted by Pei Chuanzhen, a woman from Maocun Township, leading to Pei Chuanzhen being forced to commit suicide.

Pei Chuanzhen, 19 years old, of middle-peasant background, was from the Northeast Tang Administrative Village, Maocun Township, Chengdong District, Yixing. In 1948, she was engaged to Lu Xiaolong, the son of a wealthy peasant in Zhoushu Township, through a parental arrangement. Her parents received six dan of rice and two silver dollars as betrothal gifts. At that time, Pei Chuanzhen was young and did not clearly express her attitude. After the liberation of Yixing, under the education of the Party and the People's Government, Pei Chuanzhen's political awareness gradually increased, and she enthusiastically participated in various social activities and conducted various publicity and encouragement work among the masses. In a theatrical performance, she met Gu, who was from the same administrative village, and gradually developed feelings for each other. They both went to apply for the Military and Political University twice, but Pei Chuanzhen was not admitted. After Gu entered the Military and Political University, he was active in his studies and work and was elected as the organization committee member of the Youth League branch of the school. Therefore, their love became even stronger, and they frequently exchanged letters, sharing their study and work situations. Pei Chuanzhen became increasingly dissatisfied with the arranged marriage her parents had set up. In February of this year, a letter Gu wrote to Pei Chuanzhen was discovered by her parents and older brother. Her parents and brothers took the initiative to propose to the man's family that the wedding should take place within half a month. Under the coercion of her parents, Pei Chuanzhen held a wedding ceremony with Lu Xiaolong on March 22nd. However, Pei Chuanzhen resolutely refused to live with Lu Xiaolong.

Six days after the wedding, Pei Chuanzhen went to the Dingshan District government to request a divorce. The responsible cadre of the district government was not there, and the clerk of the district only asked two or three questions and said, "You want a divorce only six or seven days after the wedding? Go back and think about it. Come back if you really want a divorce..." After saying this, he left. Because she did not receive a satisfactory answer, Pei Chuanzhen refused to leave the district government. Coincidentally, the township head of Zhoushu Township came to the district for business and asked Pei Chuanzhen to return to the township government to resolve the issue. After arriving at the township government, instructor Yu of Maocun Township said to her, "What's wrong with your marriage, only six or seven days after the wedding? Things will slowly get better." It was not until late at night that the village head sent her home. The next day, a cadre from the district women's federation went to the township government. Pei Chuanzhen again stated her reasons for divorce, but the cadre of the women's federation not only did not provide a reasonable solution but said, "Six or seven days after the wedding is not enough for a divorce; it's just a disagreement with the man..." That day, the township government notified her parents' family by telephone to take Pei Chuanzhen back and persuade her. A day later, Fan Qing'e, the deputy township head of Maocun Township (the sister-in-law of Lu Xiaolong's sister), along with Jiang Lai'di, a woman from the township, and a comrade from the land reform work team, went to Pei Chuanzhen's home and used the same reasons to persuade her not to divorce. Pei Chuanzhen did not accept their persuasion and pointed out to Fan Qing'e the reasons why she wanted a divorce. Fan Qing'e could not answer and criticized her, saying, "If you didn't want to marry Lu Xiaolong, you should have said so earlier. Now he has spent so much money, and you still want a divorce!" Pei Chuanzhen's older brother then said, "Township Head Fan, if she leaves, I don't want this sister either!" Seeing that Township Head Fan was angry, Chuanzhen's mother said, "Township Head Fan, she must go. The date has been set; we'll send her off on the fifth day of the fourth month! Whether she lives or dies is up to her. If she dies, just wrap her in a reed mat." On April 3rd, instructor Yu of Maocun Township called Pei Chuanzhen to talk again, still persuading her not to divorce. Pei Chuanzhen was forced to the point where she had no choice but to pretend to agree. When she returned home, she deliberately looked happy. Her mother and older brother thought she had really agreed, so they quickly helped her pack the things she should take home. That night, Pei Chuanzhen secretly wrote a note that said, "I have no face to see anyone...!" She falsely claimed she was going to a meeting in the village and committed suicide by drowning herself in the river.

After the incident occurred, the district and township cadres did not report it. A week later, the Yixing County People's Court learned of the above situation and immediately urged the district government by telephone to make a detailed investigation report (at that time, the court was busy suppressing counter-revolutionaries and did not have time to send people down), but the district government still ignored it. Later, the county People's Court sent people to the countryside to investigate, proving that the above situation was completely true. The People's Court has now criticized and educated the relevant irresponsible district and township cadres involved in the case. Instructor Yu has also made a written self-criticism and gave a typical report at the county civil affairs assistant meeting.

Editor's Note: The district and township cadres of Dingshan District, Yixing County, bear considerable responsibility for the suicide of Pei Chuanzhen. The district and township cadres did not care about the suffering of women and did not provide a satisfactory answer to women's requests for divorce, causing the serious consequence of suicide. All cadres at all levels who do not seriously handle marriage issues should learn a lesson from this. We believe that it is not enough for the Yixing County People's Government to only give the relevant cadres a disciplinary warning and only have Instructor Yu give a typical report at the cadre meeting. The relevant cadres must make a profound self-criticism, and it must be publicized among the masses and cadres to educate the masses and educate the cadres.

    宜兴人民法院认真处理婚姻案件
    批评区乡失职干部 
    失职干部应作出检讨报告在群众中公布
    苏南宜兴县丁山区茆圻乡、周墅乡一部分区、乡干部存在着封建思想，对茆圻乡妇女裴川珍提出的离婚要求，迟迟不作圆满答复，以致造成裴川珍被迫自杀案件。
    裴川珍，宜兴城东区茆圻乡东北塘行政村人，中农成份，现年十九岁。一九四八年，由父母包办与周墅乡一富农的儿子陆小龙订婚。父母得了稻谷六担、银元两枚的聘礼。当时，裴川珍年龄尚幼，没有明确表示态度。宜兴解放后，在党和人民政府的教育下，裴川珍的政治觉悟逐渐提高，经常热心参加各种社会活动，并向群众进行各种宣传鼓励工作。在演剧中，和同一行政村的顾某相识，彼此之间，渐渐发生感情。他们曾两度同去投考军政大学，但裴川珍没有被录取。顾某进入军政大学后，学习、工作都很积极，被选为该校青年团支部组织委员。因此，彼此间的爱情更加浓厚，经常通信，交换学习和工作情况。裴川珍对父母的包办婚姻，也日益不满。今年二月，顾某给裴川珍写的一封信，被她的父母和哥哥发现。父兄们便主动向男方提出要在半月内结婚。裴川珍在父母的逼迫下，于三月二十二日与陆小龙举行了结婚仪式。但裴川珍坚决拒绝与陆小龙同居。
    结婚后第六天，裴川珍便到丁山区区政府要求离婚。区政府负责干部不在，该区文书仅问了两三句话，便说：“刚刚结婚六七天，就要离婚？先回去考虑考虑，真的要离婚再来吧……”说罢，便走了。裴川珍因为没有得到圆满的答复，不肯离开区政府。恰巧周墅乡乡长有事到区里来，要裴川珍回到乡政府解决问题。到乡政府后，茆圻乡俞指导员向她说：“结婚才六七天，有什么心火不合，慢慢地就会好起来。”直到深夜，村长才把她送回家去。次日，该区妇女联合会干事到乡政府去。裴川珍又向她申述离婚的理由，但妇女联合会干事不但不给合理解决，反说：“结婚才六七天，不够离婚条件，只是与男人心火不合……”当天，乡政府便以电话通知她娘家，将裴川珍领回去进行劝说。隔了一天，茆圻乡副乡长范青娥（陆小龙姐姐的妯娌）同该乡妇女蒋来娣和土地改革工作队的一位同志，又到裴川珍家，以同样的理由劝她不要离婚。裴川珍没有接受她们的劝告，并向范青娥指出自己所以要离婚的理由。范青娥无以对答，便批评她说：“你不愿意同陆小龙结婚，应该早点提出来，现在人家已经花了这么多钱，还要离婚！”裴川珍的哥哥接着说：“范乡长，她下去，我也不要这个妹子了！”川珍的母亲见范乡长耍了脾气，便说：“范乡长，她一定要去的，日子已经看好了，四月初五就送她走！去了，死也好，活也好，随她的便。死了，用芦席包包。”四月三日，茆圻乡俞指导员，又把裴川珍叫去谈话，仍然劝她不要离婚。裴川珍被逼得没有办法，便假装应允。回到家里，脸上故意装出高兴的样子。她娘和哥哥以为她真的答应了，便赶紧替她整理回家应带的东西。当天晚上，裴川珍暗地里写了一张条子，上面写着：“我没脸见人了……！”假说到村里开会，投河自杀。
    事件发生后，该区区、乡干部竟不报告。一星期后，宜兴县人民法院获悉了上述情况，即以电话催促该区区政府作详细调查报告（当时，法院忙于镇压反革命工作，未及派人下去），但区政府仍置之不理。后来，该县人民法院即派人下乡调查，证明上述情况完全属实。现人民法院已予该案有关的区、乡失职干部以批评教育。俞指导员并作出书面检讨，在该县民政助理会议上，作了典型报告。
    编者按：宜兴县丁山区妇女裴川珍之所以自杀，该区区乡干部是负有相当责任的。该区区乡干部不关心妇女疾苦，对妇女离婚要求不做圆满答复，引起了自杀事件的严重后果。一切不严肃认真处理婚姻问题的各级干部应由此得到教训。我们认为：宜兴县人民政府仅给有关干部以批评处分、仅让俞指导员在干部会上做典型报告是不够的，必须使有关干部做出深刻检讨，并在群众中、干部中公布，以教育群众、教育干部。
