    Protest Against the Thai Government's Destruction of Overseas Chinese Education
    On September 26th, the reactionary Thai government of Luang Phibunsongkhram shut down the Yuek Keng People's School, established by overseas Chinese in Bangkok, forcing more than 400 overseas Chinese students to drop out of school. The "reason" given by the reactionary Luang Phibunsongkhram government was that some of the school's forms were not translated into Thai, and that extracurricular teaching was being used to "spread political ideas." It is also preparing to persecute other overseas Chinese schools using the same "reasons." This is another crime committed by the reactionary Luang Phibunsongkhram government in persecuting overseas Chinese in Thailand by fascist means. This arbitrary and unreasonable measure by the reactionary Luang Phibunsongkhram government has aroused the anger of the Chinese people and the broad masses of overseas Chinese.
    The reactionary Luang Phibunsongkhram government has consistently followed the US imperialist policy of preparing for war against the people, using all despicable tricks to persecute overseas Chinese and wantonly destroy overseas Chinese education. In May 1948 and May 1950, the reactionary Luang Phibunsongkhram government illegally closed nearly 400 overseas Chinese schools twice, forcing more than 210,000 overseas Chinese students and nearly 4,000 teachers to drop out of school and lose their jobs. The Ministry of Education of the Luang Phibunsongkhram government also ordered the "uniformity of Chinese and Thai language proficiency" and the "unification of Chinese textbooks" in order to systematically destroy overseas Chinese education; and held teacher "re-examinations" to further control overseas Chinese teachers. All these facts show that the reactionary Luang Phibunsongkhram government is increasingly intensifying its atrocities of persecuting overseas Chinese and destroying overseas Chinese education. This is intolerable to the Chinese people. We strongly protest against the unreasonable behavior of the Thai government, and support the Yuek Keng People's School, demanding that the Thai government revoke the unreasonable closure order; and demand that the Thai government stop all measures and conspiracies to persecute overseas Chinese and destroy overseas Chinese education.

    抗议泰政府摧残华侨教育
    九月二十六日，泰国銮披汶反动政府查封了华侨在曼谷设立的越坑平民学校，使四百多华侨学生被迫失学。銮披汶反动政府所持的“理由”，是说该校部分表格未译成泰文，利用课余时间授课与“传播政治思想”，它并准备以同样“理由”迫害其他华侨学校。这是銮披汶反动政府用法西斯手段迫害在泰国华侨的又一罪行。銮披汶反动政府这种蛮横无理的措施，已引起中国人民和广大华侨的愤怒。
    銮披汶反动政府一贯追随美国帝国主义执行准备战争反对人民的政策，使用一切卑劣的伎俩迫害华侨，对华侨教育事业横加摧残。一九四八年五月和一九五○年五月，銮披汶反动政府两次非法查封华侨学校近四百所，使二十一万多华侨学生和近四千教师被迫失学失业。銮披汶政府教育部又下令“划一中、泰文程度”和“统一中文课本”，以便有计划地摧残华侨教育；并举行师资“复考”，进一步管制华侨教师。以上这些事实，表明了銮披汶反动政府正日益加紧其迫害华侨、摧残华侨教育的暴行。这是中国人民所不能容忍的。我们严重地抗议泰国政府的无理行为，并支援越坑平民学校，要求泰国政府撤销无理查封的命令；并要求泰国政府停止一切迫害华侨、摧残华侨教育事业的措施和阴谋。
