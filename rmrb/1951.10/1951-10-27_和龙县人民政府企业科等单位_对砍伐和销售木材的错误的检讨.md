Column: Response to Readers' Criticism and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor's Note: After the publication of Comrade Li Guiling's article "Jilin Provincial People's Court and Other Agencies Arbitrarily Felling and Selling Timber" on the second page of this newspaper on August 29th, most of the criticized agencies and units have conducted self-criticism. These self-criticisms are now published below. We hope that other criticized agencies and units will promptly conduct investigations and publish the results in the newspaper.

    I. The Enterprise Section of the Helong County People's Government's Self-Criticism

    Last winter, when we were transporting old timber on behalf of the Provincial People's Government, we violated state regulations and arbitrarily felled hard miscellaneous trees such as oak and elm to use as cart posts. This was because we did not educate our cadres adequately on the state's forest protection policies and laws. We should conduct a deep self-criticism and strengthen policy education for our cadres in the future to correct our mistakes.

    II. The Enterprise Section of the Yanbian Prefectural Commissioner's Office's Self-Criticism

    We did indeed sell timber, selling 6,828 cubic meters to public institutions and 157 cubic meters to private merchants. In particular, selling to private merchants without the approval of higher authorities, fostered speculation and profiteering by private merchants, which was extremely wrong. We have now submitted the remaining old timber to the Provincial People's Government Planning Committee for disposal. In addition, we would like to state that we only hauled out the old timber and did not fell a single new tree; some of the cart posts were sold to us by the Antu County Government Forestry Section, we did not fell them.

    III. The Self-Criticism of the Enterprise Section and Agriculture Section of the Jiaohe County People's Government, the Public Security Bureau, the Court, and the Huangsongdianzi District Government

    We sincerely accept Comrade Li Guiling's criticism. Our units lacked an overall perspective. Although cleaning up the forest farm and hauling out the old timber was approved by the Provincial People's Government, our thinking was primarily focused on solving the financial expenditures of our own units. We now realize that this was wrong and should be corrected. Finally, we have the following statement: The timber we transported was old timber approved by the provincial forestry authorities, and we did not arbitrarily fell new trees.

### 和龙县人民政府企业科等单位  对砍伐和销售木材的错误的检讨

    和龙县人民政府企业科等单位
    对砍伐和销售木材的错误的检讨
    编者按：八月二十九日本报二版刊登了李贵龄同志批评“吉林省人民法院等机关擅自采伐销售木材”一文后，大部分被批评的机关单位已进行检讨。现将这些检讨发表于后。我们希望其他被批评机关单位迅速进行检查，并将检查结果在报纸上公布。
    一、和龙县人民政府企业科的检讨
    我们去年冬季代省人民政府搬运陈材时，竟违反国家规定，擅自砍伐柞榆等硬杂木作车立柱。这是我们平日对国家护林政策法令教育干部不够所致，我们应作深刻检讨，今后要加强对干部的政策教育，纠正错误。
    二、延边专署企业科的检讨
    我们确曾销售木材，计卖给公营机关六千八百二十八立方公尺，卖给私商一百五十七立方公尺；特别是没有经过上级批准卖给私商，助长了私商投机倒把的行为，这是极端错误的。现我们已将存余的陈材呈报省人民政府计划委员会处理。此外，我们声明一点：就是我们只是拉出了陈材，没有采伐一棵新树；部分车立柱是安图县政府林政科卖给我们的，我们没有砍伐。
    三、蛟河县人民政府企业科、农业科、公安局、法院及黄松甸子区政府的检讨
    我们诚恳地接受李贵龄同志的批评。我们这几个单位缺乏整体观念，清理林场，拉出陈材，虽经省人民政府批准，但我们思想上主要是从解决本单位的财政开支出发的。现在我们认识到这是错误的，应当改正。最后我们有以下声明：我们所搬运的木材，是经省林政机关批准的陈材，并未擅自砍伐新木。
