    Preliminary Experiences in the Tianjin Railway Bureau's Capital Verification Work
    Guo Hongtao, Director of the Tianjin Railway Bureau

    Due to the complexity and vastness of railway enterprises, the Tianjin Railway Bureau's asset inventory and capital verification work was carried out in two steps. The first step was to inventory current assets and verify working capital; the second step was to inventory fixed assets and verify fixed capital. In carrying out the first step, the Bureau preliminarily inspected the use of funds in four units: a certain railway factory, Fengtai Locomotive Depot, Cangxian Engineering Section, and Tianjin Rolling Stock Inspection Section. The preliminary experiences are described below:

        Sharp Contrast

    According to our inspection, as of the end of June, the working capital of a certain railway factory was 2.4 times the fixed amount; the working capital of Fengtai Locomotive Depot was 2.94 times the fixed amount; the working capital of Cangxian Engineering Section was 2.2 times the fixed amount; and the working capital of Tianjin Rolling Stock Inspection Section was 2.34 times the fixed amount.

    Judging from the above figures, the working capital of these four units was overstocked by 1.2 to 1.94 times; in other words, the working capital of each factory/section was sufficient for two to three similar factories/sections. Among them, material waste was the most significant. For example, the materials at Fengtai Locomotive Depot were sufficient for five similar depots. This waste of state assets is very alarming. Why did this situation arise? The main reasons are as follows:

    First, cadres have long held onto the supply system mentality, focusing only on tasks and efficiency, and lacking a cost perspective. In order to complete tasks and improve efficiency, they believed that the more materials, the better. Therefore, they requested materials regardless of whether they were needed, resulting in a disconnect between material plans and actual material usage, leading to serious overstocking and waste of current assets.

    Second, each factory/section had a large inventory of commonly used materials. Some materials were not useful to the original unit, or were not temporarily useful, but were urgently needed by other units. However, the business departments or material departments lacked capital management thinking and did not allocate them in a timely manner.

    Third, because each factory/section did not tightly control working capital, the quantitative work for current assets, especially materials, was not checked and determined in a timely manner, so they did not know which materials were needed by the factory/section and which materials should be returned to the Bureau for processing.

    Fourth, the Bureau failed to promptly dispose of unusable railway materials stored by each factory/section, or hand them over to the state for allocation, or reprocess and transform them, or auction them off, resulting in a serious overstocking of unused materials.

    Mobilize the Masses to Do a Good Job in Asset Inventory and Capital Verification

    Inventorying current assets and verifying working capital is a mass work that must mobilize and organize cadres at all levels and absorb on-site workers familiar with materials in order to do it well. Only through joint research can current assets be easily clarified and valuation can be done correctly. Based on this principle, there are significant shortcomings in the Bureau's inventory work. First of all, the rationale was not explained to the cadres and workers participating in the inventory, and the methods were not clearly explained. The Bureau and Branch Bureau-level Capital Verification Committees only had organizational forms, did not assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for daily work, and regarded this complex and heavy work as easy, so the leadership was not strong. The Bureau is currently drawing cadres and assigning dedicated personnel to strengthen this work.

    The types of materials are very complex. A certain railway factory alone has as many as 10,000 types of materials, and there are more than 7,000 types of commonly used materials. The names of each material are not uniform, the specifications are inconsistent, the quality standards are different, and the condition of the materials varies. Each material must be counted, identified, registered, and valued; this is an extremely heavy task. Although the Tianjin Railway Bureau's current asset inventory work has basically been completed, there are still significant discrepancies. Among the returned materials handed over to the Bureau by each factory/section, unusable materials are not necessarily unusable, and waste materials are not necessarily waste. It is still necessary to send specialized personnel to continue to identify and process them. The tools used by the railway are extremely complex, and the specifications and quality are also different. It is difficult to identify their lifespan and value. Even tools of the same material and specifications, due to the different levels of work, also affect the length of the tool's lifespan. Therefore, for the inventory of tools and the identification of their lifespan, it is necessary to absorb experienced veteran workers familiar with the tools and estimate their lifespan based on the specific usage of each tool. This estimate relies only on the experience of the workers, so it is impossible to be completely accurate. Other current assets are cleaned and registered based on the actual quantity and current condition.

    The valuation of current assets is carried out according to the degree of newness. Materials that are 80% new or more are calculated at the full price of the material standard unit price, materials that are 30% to 80% new are calculated at half the price of the material standard unit price, and materials that are less than 30% new are calculated as waste products. The valuation of materials not in the material catalog is calculated by referring to similar material unit prices.

    In the process of this current asset inventory work, some shortcomings in material management were also discovered. For example, many self-purchased tools and furniture by sections were not entered into the books; the return material system was not strict; the return of materials from workshops or small group warehouses was often not registered; tools were issued on-site without records, while the material warehouse had already processed the reimbursement, etc., resulting in off-book items. The total value of off-book items in Fengtai Locomotive Depot was more than 66 million yuan, while that of a certain factory was more than 190 million yuan. Secondly, the material accounts did not match, and each unit had surpluses and deficits. Among them, in addition to a very small part of reasonable surpluses and deficits due to scale differences or natural consumption of materials, most were due to improper storage, insufficient inspection, some mixing of the same type of materials with different specifications and dimensions, unclear classification; some on-site material issues were not registered in a timely manner or even missed registration; and some waste piles were not completely cleaned up. Approximately one ton of screws, worth more than 62 million yuan, were also found in the iron filings pile of a certain factory. Therefore, while cleaning up current assets, it is necessary to strengthen on-site material management.

    After the current assets of each factory/section are inventoried, the current assets must be further determined, so that the surplus current assets can be returned to the Bureau, and the problem of the factory/section's overstocked funds can be solved. Therefore, doing a good job in the quantitative work of current assets is a very important issue. The Bureau's quantitative determination of current assets is divided into materials, tools, coal, other low-value consumables, spare parts, and deferred expenses (including furniture, work clothes, protective equipment, office supplies, etc.), work-in-progress, finished products, and cash in factory sections. Cangxian Engineering Section and Fengtai Locomotive Depot did a better job in this work. Their experience is: to do a good job in the quantitative determination of materials, first of all, it is necessary to do a good job in the quantitative determination of material consumption; secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in the standard reserve days for materials. To formulate tool quotas, first of all, it is necessary to proceed from the specific needs and check out the tool quotas based on the principle of organizing and completing tasks. Secondly, it is necessary to check and determine its consumption and lifespan based on the complexity of using the tool and the quality of the tool. Regarding the quantitative determination of coal. There are two uses for coal on the railway: one is for transportation, which is the main use; the other is for power, forging, casting, and office use; therefore, the quantitative determination methods for coal are also divided into two categories. Taking Fengtai Locomotive Depot as an example: the coal for transportation is determined based on the sum of the actual coal load of the locomotive tender over a certain period of time. As for the continued supply of coal, it is the responsibility of the fuel factory and is not included in the depot's working capital. Coal for power, forging, casting, and office use is determined based on the coal consumption quota for power, forging, and casting, and the actual needs for office coal. Quantitative determination of other low-value consumables, spare parts, and deferred expenses. The quantitative determination method for this item of working capital is the same as that for tools, except for office supplies, and is determined based on the actual required quantity. The quantitative determination of work-in-progress is checked and determined based on the number of days required to complete each type of work-in-progress as stipulated in the production financial plan. The quantitative determination of finished products is checked and determined based on the number of days of finished product storage as stipulated in the production financial plan. The quantitative determination of cash in factory sections is determined according to the standards stipulated by the Bureau.

    After checking and determining the quantity of current assets, the total amount of working capital can be calculated according to its specified standard unit price, so that the required working capital can be verified.

    Timely Processing of Returned Materials is a Good Way to Eradicate Waste

    After the materials of each factory/section are inventoried and registered, except for the quantitative materials required by the factory/section that are retained, the remaining materials (including commonly used materials and unused materials) should be listed separately and returned to the Bureau's Capital Verification Branch and the Branch Bureau's Capital Verification Sub-committee for processing. The processing of these returned materials is the most important and difficult work; the problem of overstocking current assets and working capital in each factory/section is solved by handling the return material procedures, but for the Bureau and the state, if the return materials are not processed in a timely manner, this problem is still not solved. Therefore, while cleaning up assets and verifying capital, it is necessary to seize the processing of return material issues. How to deal with the return material problem? The "Provisional Measures for Capital Verification of State-owned Enterprises" promulgated by the Central Finance and Economics Commission once pointed out: "1. Adjustments should be made locally or within a certain area or across the country within the system to which the enterprise belongs. 2. Each ministry of the major administrative region and each ministry of the central government should make adjustments between departments or regions." According to this instruction, regarding the processing of return materials, we put forward the following guiding opinions:

    First, although the commonly used materials cleaned up by each unit are not temporarily useful to themselves, they may be urgently needed by other units, so they should be allocated to the material-using units by the material department in coordination with other business departments. For example, a certain railway factory has as many as 28 passenger car generators, worth 336 million yuan, which have been stagnant and useless for a long time; a large number of freight car parts, worth approximately 235 million yuan, these parts, a certain railway factory has stopped repairing freight cars, so they are uselessly overstocked. These two materials may be very useful to other vehicle factories and other inspection sections. For example, the four sets of turnouts and some usable steel rails cleaned up by the Cangxian Engineering Section have become unused materials in the section, but are urgently needed in other new construction sites. These commonly used materials have become unused materials for a long time for the original unit, but they are urgently needed materials for other units, so they should be allocated to the material-needing units.

    Second, commonly used materials that are cleaned up by each unit and are temporarily unused should be returned to the material factory as soon as possible after handling the return material procedures. If the material factory cannot accommodate them, several factories/sections can be designated to keep them in custody, but they must be clearly distinguished from the materials of the factories/sections. For example, a certain railway factory has leather belt oil in stock, which is estimated to be usable for ten years; and 4,000 kilograms of tool steel in stock, which is estimated to be usable for two years. These materials belong to this category. The value of the materials that a certain railway factory needs to return is 12.249 billion yuan, of which the value of commonly used materials is reported by the factory to be approximately 6.4 billion yuan. The value of the materials that Fengtai Locomotive Depot needs to return is more than 2.3 billion yuan, and its commonly used materials account for more than 1.9 billion yuan. The value of the materials that Cangxian Engineering Section needs to return is more than 1.9 billion yuan, of which commonly used materials account for more than 1.8 billion yuan. These materials are the most useful on the entire railway, but in the original unit, they have become unused materials and are overstocked. If the numbers cleaned up on the entire railway are added together, it will be alarming.

    Third, incomplete commonly used materials that are cleaned up, although they are also waste materials, can still be turned into useful materials after being repaired by the reprocessing plant. For example, the incomplete turnout parts cleaned up by the Cangxian Engineering Section can be turned into good and useful turnout parts after being repaired by the Beijing Engineering Machinery Repair and Assembly Factory; short steel rails of more than five meters can be used on side lines after electric welding. For example, four Hawes water pumps in a certain railway factory can be turned into useful water pumps after being repaired by a certain bridge factory. This item alone is worth approximately 600 million yuan in a certain railway factory.

    Fourth, good materials that are cleaned up as unused or non-standard and cannot be used can still be turned into useful materials after being transformed or reprocessed. For example, 43 pieces of non-standard large copper square tiles, weighing about one and a half tons, in a certain railway factory can be sent to the foundry for remelting; non-standard springs can be remade into new springs or other tools; if the cast iron machine cannot be repaired at all, it can be crushed and used as raw materials for cast iron; waste axles can be remade into pins for locomotive connecting rods, or thinner connecting rods, etc.

    In order to carry out the above-mentioned repair, assembly, and transformation work, the work of the railway reprocessing plant must be strengthened. The Beijing Engineering Machinery Repair and Assembly Factory is responsible for completing all materials such as turnout steel rails that need to be repaired, assembled, and reprocessed in terms of engineering. The Changxindian Electrical Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Factory is responsible for completing the materials that need to be repaired or reprocessed in terms of telecommunications. The reprocessing plant of a certain railway factory and the Tianjin Steel Parts Factory are responsible for this item of materials in terms of locomotives.

    In addition, materials cleaned up that are not needed by the railway, or materials that are temporarily not needed by the railway, but are urgently needed by other railway bureaus, should be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for processing. Materials not needed by the railway, such as automobile parts, spinning machinery, and agricultural implements, should be transferred to the Central Finance and Economics Commission by the ministry. Fundamentally useless waste materials should be auctioned off uniformly by the Bureau.

    In order to do a good job in the return material work, experienced technical personnel from the locomotive, engineering, telecommunications, and material departments should absorb workers from each site who are familiar with the materials to form return material processing teams to work in each unit. The team must first do a good job in the identification of materials. There are discrepancies between the on-site identification of materials and the actual situation, even significant discrepancies. For example, the commonly used materials reported by a certain railway factory accounted for only 50% of the returned materials. After investigation, they accounted for 75% of the returned materials. Secondly, after doing a good job in the identification of materials, the processing team should process them on the spot according to the above seven principles.

    After the implementation of the economic accounting system, in order not to overstock funds, factories and sections will reduce or even eliminate the phenomenon of overstocking unused materials. However, in the process of production, unused materials will continue to be generated. Therefore, each unit should have a dedicated person responsible for regularly collecting unused materials for sorting and stacking neatly, or sending them to the reprocessing plant in a timely manner, or reporting them to the Bureau for auction in a timely manner, so as to completely eradicate the phenomenon of continuing to stack unused materials.

    天津铁路局核定资金工作的初步经验
    天津铁路管理局局长  郭洪涛
    由于铁路企业的复杂庞大，天津铁路管理局的清理资产核定资金工作，是分成两步来进行的。第一步清理流动资产，核定流动资金；第二步清理固定资产，核定固定资金。管理局在进行第一步工作中，初步检查了某铁路工厂、丰台机务段、沧县工务段及天津检车段等四个单位的运用资金情况。兹将初步经验分述于后：
        鲜明的对比
    据我们检查所得，截至六月底止，某铁路工厂的流动资金为定量的二点四倍；丰台机务段的流动资金为定量的二点九四倍；沧县工务段的流动资金为定量的二点二倍；天津检车段的流动资金为定量的二点三四倍。
    从以上数字来看，这四个单位的流动资金，都积压了一点二至一点九四倍；换句话说，每一个厂、段的流动资金，都足够两个到三个同样的厂、段之用。其中材料一项浪费最大，如丰台机务段的材料，竟够五个同样段之用。这种对国家资产的浪费，是非常惊人的。为什么会产生这种情况呢？主要的有以下几个原因：
    第一、由于干部长期存在着供给制思想，只有任务观点，效能观点，缺少成本观点。他们为了完成任务，提高效能，就认为材料愈多愈好。因此，他们不问需要与否，只管开单领料；这就形成材料计划和实际用料情况脱节，造成流动资产严重的积压与浪费现象。
    第二、各厂、段都存有大量的常用材料，有些材料对于原存单位没有用处，或者暂时没有用处，对别的单位，却是急需的材料；但各业务处或材料处，缺乏资金管理思想，没有及时调配。
    第三、由于各厂、段对于流动资金掌握不紧，因而对于流动资产，特别是材料的定量工作，没有及时查定，这样就不知道何项材料是该厂、段所需，何项材料应退管理局处理。
    第四、各厂、段保存的铁路无法利用的材料，管理局未能及时处理，或上缴国家调配，或再制改造，或拍卖，以致造成不用的材料严重的积压现象。
    发动群众做好清理资产核定资金工作
    清理流动资产、核定流动资金，是一个群众性的工作，必须动员与组织各级干部，并吸收熟悉材料的现场职工参加，才能做得好。只有大家共同研究，才容易把流动资产弄清楚，估价也才容易做得正确。根据这一原则来检查管理局的清理工作，是有很大缺点的。首先对于干部及参加清理的职工，既没有讲明道理，又没有把办法交代清楚。管理局和分局两级核定资金委员会，只有组织形式，没有调派专人负责日常工作，并且把这一复杂繁重的工作，看得轻而易举，因此领导是不强的。管理局正在抽调干部，指派专人，加强这一工作。
    材料的种类是很复杂的，仅某铁路工厂的材料种类即达一万种之多，常用料亦有七千多种；每一种材料名称既不统一，规格又不一致，质量标准既不同，材料的新旧程度又各异。对每一种材料，都须加以清点、鉴别、登记、估价；这是一件极其繁重的工作。天津铁路局流动资产的清理工作，虽然基本上已做完了，但是出入仍然很大。各厂、段交给管理局的退料当中，不用料不一定不用，废料不一定废，还需要派出专门的人，继续进行鉴别与处理。铁路所用的工具极其复杂，规格质量也都不相同，要鉴别其寿命和价值，是一件很困难的事。就是材质、规格一样的工具，由于工作繁简程度不同，也影响到工具寿命的长短。因此对于工具的清理及寿命的鉴定，都须吸收熟悉工具的老工友参加，根据每种工具的具体使用情况，估定其寿命。这种估计，只是依靠工友的经验，故不可能做到完全正确。其他流动资产，都是根据实有数及现在的新旧成色进行清理登记的。
    流动资产的估价，是按照鉴别新、旧的程度进行的。八成新以上按材料标准单价全价计算，三成至八成新按材料标准单价半价计算，三成以下按废品计算。材料目录上没有的材料估价，比照类似的材料单价计算。
    在此次清理流动资产工作过程中，还发现了材料管理工作上的一些缺点。例如，段自置工具和家具很多没有登帐；退料制度不严格；车间或小组小仓库的退料往往不登记；现场领用工具无记载而料库已按报销办理，等等；因而产生了帐外品。丰台机务段帐外品总值有六千六百多万元，某工厂则达一亿九千多万元。其次是料帐不符，各单位都有盈与亏的现象。其中除极少部分因磅差或材料自然消耗等合理的盈亏外，绝大部分由于保管不当，检查不周，有的将规格尺寸不同的同类材料参杂一起，分类不清；有的现场领用材料未及时登帐甚至漏登；也有的废料堆清理不彻底。某工厂铁末堆里还发现约一吨螺丝，价值六千二百多万元。因此与清理流动资产同时，必须加强现场的材料管理工作。
    各厂、段的流动资产清理之后，必须进一步把流动资产确定，这样才能把多余的流动资产退给管理局，才能解决了厂、段积压资金的问题。因此做好流动资产的定量工作，是一个很重要的问题。管理局流动资产的定量，共分材料、工具、燃煤、其他低值易耗品、备品和递延支出（包括家具、作业服装、防护用品、事务用品等）、在制品、成品、厂段的现金等数种。这项工作，以沧县工务段和丰台机务段做得比较好，他们的经验是：要做好材料的定量工作，首先要做好材料的消耗定量；其次就要做好材料标准储备日数。要制定工具定量，首先要根据组织起来、完成任务的原则，从具体需要情况出发，查出工具定量。其次要根据使用工具的繁简和工具质量的好坏，查定它的消耗量和寿命。关于燃煤定量问题。铁路上的燃煤用途有二：一为运转用煤，为主要用途；一为动力、锻、铸和办公用煤；因此燃煤的定量方法也分为两类。以丰台机务段为例：运转用煤系根据机车煤水车一定时期的实际载煤量的总和确定的。至于燃煤的继续供应，则由燃料厂负责，不计入段的流动资金之内。动力、锻、铸和办公用煤，系根据动力、锻、铸的燃煤消费定额和办公用煤实际需要量而定。其他低值易耗品、备品和递延支出的定量问题。此项流动资金定量方法，除事务用品外，与工具相同，是根据实际需要数量核定。在制品的定量是根据生产财务计划规定的每种在制品完成日数查定。成品的定量是根据生产财务计划规定的成品存储日数查定。厂段的现金定量是根据管理局规定的标准确定。
    查定了流动资产的定量，按其规定的标准单价，即可算出流动资金的总数，这样即可核定其所需的流动资金了。
    及时处理退料，是根绝浪费的好办法
    各厂段的材料清理登记之后，除本厂段所需的定量材料仍保留外，其剩余材料（包括常用料及不用料在内）应分别开具清单，一律退交管理局核定资金分会及分局核定资金支会处理。这种退料的处理，是一个最重要和最困难的工作；各厂、段办理了退料手续，他们积压流动资产和流动资金的问题，固然是解决了，但对于管理局和国家来说，如果不及时处理退料，这个问题仍然没有得到解决。因此在清理资产核定资金的同时，必须抓紧处理退料问题。如何处理退料问题？中央财政经济委员会颁布的“国营企业资金核定暂行办法”曾经指出：“一、按企业所属系统内，就地或在一定区域或全国内进行调剂。二、大行政区各部，中央各部，就部门间或区域间进行调剂。”根据这个指示，关于退料的处理，我们提出下列几个原则性的意见：
    第一、各单位所清理出的常用料，自己虽然暂时没有用处，其他单位可能是急需的，就应当由材料处协同其他业务处，调拨给用料单位，例如某铁路工厂，就存有客车发电机二十八台之多，价值三亿三千六百万元，长期呆滞无用；大批货车配件，约值二亿三千五百万元，这些配件，某铁路工厂已停止修理货车，所以毫无用处地积压起来了。这两项材料，对于其他车辆工厂及其他检车段，可能是很有用处的。再如沧县工务段清理出的四付道岔及一些可用的钢轨，在该段已成为不用料，但在其他新建工程的地方，却是急需的材料。这些常用的材料，对于原有的单位来讲，已经长期地变成不用料了，对于其他的单位，却是很急需的材料，就应该调拨给需用料的单位。
    第二、各单位清理出而暂时不用的常用料，办理了退料手续以后，尽先退材料厂，如果材料厂容纳不了时，可指定若干厂段代为保管，但必须和厂段的材料分清楚。如某铁路工厂所存皮带油，估计可用十年；所存工具钢四千公斤，估计可用两年，这些材料，就是属于这一类的。某铁路工厂需要退的材料价值一百二十二亿四千九百万元，其中常用料的价值，据该厂自报约值六十四亿元。丰台机务段需要退的材料价值二十三亿多，其常用料就占十九亿多，沧县工务段需要退的材料价值十九亿元多，其中常用料就占十八亿元多。这些材料在全路上是最有用处的，在原有单位，却变成了不用料积压起来了。如果把全路清理出的数字加在一起，将是惊人的。
    第三、清理出的残缺不全的常用料，虽然也是废料，但经过再制厂修理后，仍然可以变成有用的材料。如沧县工务段清查出残缺不全的道岔配件，送到北京工务机械修配厂修理后，就可以变成好的有用的道岔配件；五公尺以上的短钢轨，经过电焊，就可以用在侧线上。再如某铁路工厂华氏水泵四架，送到某桥梁工厂修配后，就可以变成有用的水泵。某铁路工厂仅这一项材料，约值六亿元之多。
    第四、清查出的不用料或不合规格不能使用的好料，经过改造或再制，仍可以变成有用的材料。如某铁路工厂不合规格的大铜方瓦四十三块约重一吨半，就可以送到铸工所重新回炉；如不合规格的弹簧，可改制新的弹簧或其他工具；如根本不能修的生铁机器，可以轧毁，作为生铁原料；如废车轴，可以改制机车连接杆的销子，或较细的连接杆等等。
    为了进行上述修配和改制工作，必须加强铁路再制所的工作。工务方面所有需要修配和再制的道岔钢轨等材料，责成北京工务机械修配厂去完成。电务方面需要修配或再制的材料，责成长辛店电气机械修造厂去完成。机务方面的此项材料，责成某铁路工厂的再制所和天津钢铁配件厂去完成。
    此外，清查出的非本路所需要的材料，或本路暂时不需要，而其他路局急需的材料，呈请铁道部处理。非铁路所需的材料，如汽车配件、纺纱机械，以及农具等材料，一律呈部转请中央财政经济委员会处理。根本无用的废料，应由管理局统一拍卖。
    为了把退料工作作好，应由机务、工务、电务、材料等处有经验的技术人员，吸收各现场熟悉材料的职工参加，分别组成退料处理小组，赴各单位进行工作。小组首先要做好材料的鉴别工作。现场对于材料的鉴别，与实际情况有出入，甚至有很大的出入。如某铁路工厂所报的常用料，仅占退料的百分之五十，经考察结果，竟占退料的百分之七十五。其次做好材料的鉴别工作以后，处理小组应当就近根据上述七项原则，分别就地处理。
    实行了经济核算制以后，厂段为了不积压资金，将会减少甚至消灭不用料积压现象。可是在生产的过程中，不用料会继续产生，因此各单位，应有专人负责，经常收集不用料加以整理，堆放整齐，或及时送再制所，或及时报管理局拍卖，彻底根绝继续堆积不用料的现象。
