Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: TASS, Paris, 5th: "L'Humanité" published an article entitled: "Two hundred Japanese officers, including several generals, have been sent to Korea to command the Li Chengwan army."
    The article said: According to American journalists, the United States Department of the Army has drafted a plan to transfer Japanese troops to Korea to replace American troops in 1951-1952. The "L'Humanité" article said: "Acheson and the people in the Department of the Army know that mobilizing Japanese troops to fight in Korea and transferring Japanese troops to the Asian continent would take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, they forced Yoshida to quickly dispatch a large number of Japanese generals and officers to Korea so that these generals and officers could become familiar with the war situation and assist the Li Chengwan army. The guarantees put forward by Yoshida show that the Japanese government has sent the first batch of people to Korea. This batch consists of 200 people, including former Navy Admiral Kobayashi Seizaburo, Navy Vice Admiral Kondo Eijiro, Army Lieutenant General Sakurai Tokutaro, former Kempeitai Colonel Suzuki, Army Colonel Sawai Ishiro, and others. These Japanese have been appointed as 'experts' and 'advisers' to the Li Chengwan Army Headquarters, wearing American uniforms and receiving a monthly salary of 150 US dollars from Ridgway's headquarters. A group of agents from the 'Hidaka Agency' (a spy agency headed by Army Captain Hidaka Shiro) and Ishikawa Shunichi, a former official of the Shanghai 'Special High School Section', have also been sent to South Korea to purge the Li Chengwan army and deal with those who sympathize with the People's Republic."

    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：“人道报”刊载了一篇文章，题目是：“包括数名将级军官在内的日本军官二百名，已被派往朝鲜指挥李承晚军。”
    这篇文章说：据美国记者们说，美国陆军部已经拟订了一项计划，计划在一九五一至一九五二年期间把日本军队调到朝鲜去代替美军作战。 “人道报”的这篇文章说：“艾奇逊和陆军部的人物们知道动员日军到朝鲜去作战以及调遣日军到亚洲大陆上去，都需要相当长的时间，因此就强令吉田火速调派大批日本将领和军官到朝鲜去，以便使这批将领和军官们熟悉战争的情况，并协助李承晚军。吉田所提出来的保证表明：日本政府已把第一批人派到朝鲜去了，这一批共有二百人，里面包括前海军大将小林省三郎、海军中将近藤英次郎、陆军中将樱井德太郎、前宪兵大佐铃木、陆军大佐泽井石郎及其他等人。这些日本人都被任命为李承晚军司令部的‘专家’和‘顾问’，身穿美国制服，每月由李奇微总部支给薪饷一百五十美元。‘日高机关’（以陆军大尉日高四郎为首的间谍机关）的一批特务以及曾任上海‘特高科’官员的石川春一，也已经被派到南朝鲜去清洗李承晚军并对付那些同情人民共和国的人们。”
