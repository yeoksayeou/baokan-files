Speech by Li Yunhan, Representative of Combat Heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

The Volunteer Army is Getting Stronger and Has Enough Power to Defeat the Enemy

Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

Premier Zhou’s and Vice Chairman Peng’s reports from the Resist-America, Aid-Korea General Association explained the current situation and pointed out the future tasks. We express our complete support. After returning to our combat posts, we will resolutely follow and implement them.

For a year, we have been fighting alongside the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield, striking at the American aggressors. We have pushed the enemy from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. Through countless battles, large and small, we have eliminated more than 380,000 enemy troops. Although our equipment is not as good as the enemy's, and we have many difficulties in various aspects, we have ultimately defeated the enemy, and the number of enemy troops we eliminate increases each time. This shows that our strength is growing stronger, while the enemy is growing weaker. Now, the comrades at the front are very confident and have high morale. Everyone feels that after fighting for a year, we have figured out the enemy's weaknesses, and we are more confident in defeating them.

In the past year, a vigorous Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement has also been launched in our country. The patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country has been raised to an unprecedented level, and immense efforts have been made to support our operations in Korea. In industry and agriculture, patriotic production competitions have been implemented. Our families have been well taken care of, and the people in various regions have warmly慰劳 the Volunteer Army. In particular, the movement to donate aircraft and cannons has raised donations for more than two thousand aircraft in just over four months. This is a very large number. When the comrades at the front heard this news, they were very happy, and everyone's determination to strike at American imperialism grew even stronger, and their confidence in victory was even higher. In the future, as our equipment further improves, we will certainly be able to eliminate more enemies. At that time, American imperialism will suffer even more painful defeats than it does now.

Although American imperialism has been badly battered on the Korean battlefield this year, suffering heavy losses, it is still unwilling to give up and stop its war of aggression. This is evident in the Korean armistice negotiations. On the one hand, it was forced to agree to negotiations, and on the other hand, it used various conspiracies to undermine and delay the negotiations, dragging them on for several months without any results. We have seen through the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, and we are prepared to wage a protracted war against it. If it still does not learn its lesson and is unwilling to resolve the Korean issue through peaceful means, we will resolutely give it an even greater blow until we achieve complete victory. We not only have the firm determination to defeat the enemy, but also have sufficient power to defeat the enemy.

This time, we returned to our motherland to participate in the National Day celebrations, saw our great leader Chairman Mao, saw the powerful strength of our motherland, saw the patriotic fervor of the people of our country, and were warmly welcomed by the people of our motherland. Now we are attending the National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference and hearing the important reports of the leaders, which makes us feel even more the loveliness of our motherland and the importance of our responsibilities. We want to express our determination to the leaders, committee members, and people of the country: After we return to the front, we will certainly fight well, eliminate more enemies, perform meritorious service for the people, and bring glory to our motherland. We will certainly use the victory of the anti-aggression war to defend our beloved motherland and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

Speech by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

The RCCK Wholeheartedly Supports Increasing Production and Practicing Economy to Strengthen Resist-America, Aid-Korea

Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow representatives:

At the beginning of my speech, I would like to solemnly state that I am willing to represent the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in completely and wholeheartedly supporting the instructions given by Chairman Mao in his opening speech at this meeting yesterday. Secondly, we fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's political report yesterday and agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the National Committee today.

After listening to the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea General Association on the Resist-America, Aid-Korea, Defend-Home-and-Country Movement, I was filled with immense excitement. In the past year, the Chinese people, together with the Korean people, and with the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, have not only directly dealt a severe blow to American imperialism on the Korean battlefield, exposing it as a paper tiger in the eyes of the world and proving that it can be completely defeated; but also, with the universal and in-depth development of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement, people of all nationalities, parties, classes, and circles in the country have become more closely united, and the patriotic ideology of the people across the country has been raised to an unprecedented level. Everyone has poured their patriotic enthusiasm into their specific work, enabling our great motherland to achieve unprecedented and brilliant achievements in various aspects of construction, especially national defense construction, in the past year.

First of all, we must pay tribute to the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! In particular, we pay tribute to the combat heroes present today! They displayed an unparalleled fighting spirit of heroism, fighting bravely, enduring hardship, and together with the Korean People's Army, drove the American invading army from the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, not only ensuring the security of the motherland and protecting the construction of the motherland, but also inspiring the will and confidence of the people all over the world, especially the people of Asia, to defend peace and oppose aggression, and winning unparalleled glory for the motherland. This is something that our people across the country should be proud of.

We must also pay tribute to the industrial and agricultural labor models who took the lead in launching the patriotic production competition! Their victories on the domestic production front have strengthened the victories on the Korean battlefield.

We must also pay tribute to the peace-loving people all over the world! Especially to the great Soviet people! Their righteous sympathy and support have strengthened our will and strength to fight. Our victory in Resist-America, Aid-Korea is also a victory for the people all over the world in defending peace and opposing aggression!

We, the Chinese people, are fighting against the American army because the American government sent troops to occupy our Taiwan, invade Korea, and encroach upon our northeastern border. We are determined to have peace, but we have the power to repel the invaders. Therefore, as long as American imperialism does not know how to retreat and does not accept peace, we will not stop fighting for a day! Therefore, we Chinese people must push the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement further forward, and the primary task is to expand and strengthen our movement to increase production and practice economy, give full play to our endless power, prepare for a long-term struggle with American imperialism, realize a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and we must liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan from the hands of American aggressors!

In the past year, thanks to the active participation of workers and peasants in the patriotic production competition and the concerted efforts of the people across the country to launch a warm donation movement, our national defense strength has been unprecedentedly strengthened and consolidated, showing the great and invincible power of the Chinese people. But has our power been fully utilized? No! We still have extremely strong, great, and immeasurable power that has not been brought into play. We must call on the people of the country to rise up together to resolutely implement increasing production and opposing waste, give full play to all our strength, everyone should make their own production and thrift plan, implement it in the patriotic pact, and transform patriotic enthusiasm into a great material force through increasing production and thrift. This force can not only defeat any aggression by imperialists and accelerate the arrival of the final victory in Resist-America, Aid-Korea, enabling us to make a greater contribution to the cause of safeguarding world peace; but it will also lay a solid foundation for the basic construction of our great motherland, create new prosperity and accelerate our country's gradual entry into industrialization.

The victories in various aspects in the past year have made us more aware of the absolute superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship system, and more aware of the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. Our victory is the victory of the people's democratic dictatorship, that is, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought! We, all the comrades of the RCCK, must work together with the people of the country to systematically and systematically study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", set off a new upsurge of studying Mao Zedong Thought in the whole party, transform our thinking, strengthen our work, and better unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and advance victoriously!

I have heard Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's resolution on the work of Resist-America, Aid-Korea on behalf of the Standing Committee, and I am willing to represent the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in expressing my complete agreement and firm support. I will call on all RCCK comrades to practice it personally, promote the masses they are connected with, and call on the broad masses of people to take Resist-America, Aid-Korea, increasing production and practicing economy as our current most important political task, and resolutely strive to fully realize this resolution!

Long live the victory of the Chinese people's Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement!

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

Long live the Asian people and the world people's movement against aggression and for the defense of peace!

Long live the leader of the people of the world, Marshal Stalin!

Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Speech by Zhang Bojun, Secretary-General of the China Democratic League

Call on League Members to Participate in the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy to Resist-America, Aid-Korea

Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

At today's second plenary session, we heard Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea General Association and Chairman Guo Moruo respectively report on the work of Resist-America, Aid-Korea and the resolution on carrying out the work of Resist-America, Aid-Korea. I represent the China Democratic League in expressing our thorough support and calling on all league members to complete this task with active and practical actions.

"The Chinese People's Volunteer Army represents the great will of the Chinese people," and with overwhelming force, crossed the Yalu River on October 25, 1950, defeating the invading army of American imperialism that was approaching the Yalu River, driving the enemy back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, and causing the American imperialism and its vassal states to suffer heavy losses, frustrating the ambitions of American imperialism to annex Korea, invade China, rule Asia, and conquer the world; at the same time, the peace-loving and anti-aggression people of the world, Asia, and China have gained infinite encouragement, strengthened unity, and increased their confidence and strength to defeat all imperialism and defend world peace.

Comrades: It is not accidental that we Chinese people have such a glorious and victorious situation! Today is October 24, and tomorrow is the glorious and great anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Resist-America, Aid-Korea for a full year; we want to pay our heartfelt respect and condolences to the meritorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, we want to pay our high respect to the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and we want to pay our high respect to the peace-loving people of the world and the great Marshal Stalin.

Comrades: The American imperialists are not willing to fail before the arrival of their doomsday; at the same time, we Chinese people will never abandon the responsibility of opposing American imperialism's invasion of Taiwan before liberating Taiwan. Chairman Mao pointed out a truth in yesterday's opening speech, that is: "The great struggle of Resist-America, Aid-Korea is still continuing, and must continue until the American government is willing to resolve it peacefully. … In order to continue to adhere to this necessary and just struggle, we need to continue to strengthen the work of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, need to increase production, practice economy, to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This is the central task of the Chinese people today." This wise and correct instruction of Chairman Mao is unconditionally supported and gladly accepted by the people of the whole country, including all nationalities, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and all patriotic and democratic people; and will guarantee the completion of this central task with practical actions. The concrete proof is that in the past two years, under the leadership and unity of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the country have participated in the three major movements of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and have reaped great achievements and progress.

Comrades: Premier Zhou pointed out in his political report that "the people's democratic united front has formed a conscious and organized team of hundreds of millions of people. … It enables people from all walks of life in the country to voluntarily unite in the movement of patriotic conventions, unite in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea war that combines internationalism and patriotism, so that the People's Volunteer Army fighting victoriously on the Korean front has obtained strong assistance in manpower, material resources, and technology." This wise instruction is very important and is the most powerful organizational form to mobilize the people of the country. In the long-term struggle to support Resist-America, Aid-Korea and liberate Taiwan, we should certainly do our best to give play to the strength of the united front, even in the period of production and construction, development of industry and agriculture, and cultural and educational work, the policy of the united front plays an equally important and indispensable role.

Comrades: Under the current new and victorious situation, there is a most urgent and important issue facing the people of the whole country, especially our democratic parties, people's organizations, and the broad patriotic and democratic people, that is, how should we rely on the working class party, the Chinese Communist Party, to successfully carry out the central task assigned to us by Chairman Mao. Separately speaking, first: How should we more closely and further unite under the banner of Chairman Mao to mobilize the people of the whole country more universally and deeply? Second: How should we do a good job of saving production in the extensive mobilization movement? We all know that under the call of saving production, the people of the Northeast have planned to increase grain production by more than 10 million tons this year. This is a huge wealth and a major achievement! If the people of the whole country can follow the advanced experience of the people of the Northeast, and organize themselves in the form of patriotic conventions, every party and government organ, every armed force, every school, and every production unit will inspect work and compile savings production plans in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions; then, the national wealth that we may and must create and obtain will reach an immeasurable and amazing number, which is the real material foundation and real strength to overthrow American imperialism.

At the same time, we must strengthen the work on the ideological front. The Chinese people, who have long been under the rule of feudalism and imperialism, have a huge task on the ideological front. We should launch a serious ideological criticism movement to carry out the necessary elimination, criticism, and educational transformation of those pro-American, pro-American, afraid-of-American ideas, the remaining ideas of feudalism, and the old democratic ideas; after this ideological transformation work, the unity of the people of the whole country will be more consolidated, the strength of Resist-America, Aid-Korea will be stronger; and the completion of the construction of the new democracy and the realization of the construction of socialism will have a smoother foundation. Therefore, first: In order to respond to Premier Zhou's call, we hope that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will do its best to assist the democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic and democratic people in earnestly organizing and promoting the movement to study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, especially as the basic task of the democratic parties to develop and consolidate organizations in 1952. Second: We hope that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will jointly establish a "Mao Zedong Academy" with the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee to select and recruit cadres of democratic parties, people's organizations, patriotic and democratic people, as well as young people from foreign countries who are interested in learning, to carry out the education of Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrades: The Chinese people, after such ideological and action training, united under the victorious and glorious banner of Mao Zedong, are glorious, powerful, and have unlimited prospects, and will certainly be able to defeat American imperialism, defend world peace, and complete the central task assigned to us by Chairman Mao.

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Speech by Huang Yanpei, Convenor of the China Democratic National Construction Association

Support the Call to Increase Production and Practice Economy to Strengthen Resist-America, Aid-Korea Work

Chairman, comrades:

The schedule of the Third Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference happens to include the anniversary of Resist-America, Aid-Korea. Chairman Mao instructed us in his opening speech: "We need to continue to strengthen the work of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, need to increase production, practice economy, to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This is the central task of the Chinese people today." This is very necessary and appropriate. We unanimously support it.

China's Resist-America, Aid-Korea is to stop American imperialism's aggression. Only by resistance can we strive for peace. This is clearly stated in the joint declaration of the democratic parties. After a year of efforts, American imperialism has shown extreme embarrassment after losing troops, generals, and replacing commanders. However, we cannot stay at the initial victory. As the ancients said: "He who walks a hundred li is half way at ninety." We still have to continue to work hard.

In the past year, the people of the whole country have recognized the great significance and lofty mission of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and have shown various active and consistent actions in the rear work. First of all, under the fervent patriotic movement, production has been greatly increased. Of course, this is in line with the economic construction policy of New China. Whether from the perspective of economic construction or from the perspective of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, both require increasing production on the one hand, and also require saving use on the other hand.

Let's take a few daily consumer goods as examples! The output of cotton cloth in 1951 can exceed the highest amount before the war. Analytically, in the first half of this year, yarn production increased by 30% compared with last year, and cloth production increased by 24.5%. The planned output of paper in 1951 increased to 155% compared with the highest amount before the war. In fact, the production of national public paper mills from January to July has exceeded 5.37%. The output of flue-cured tobacco leaves this year increased to 130.5% compared with the highest amount before the war, and more than four times compared with last year. Production has greatly increased, but let's take cigarettes as an example! Assuming that one-fifth of the country's population smokes one more cigarette per person per day, then even with this much cigarette production this year, it is still short by one-third. This is just one example.

Increasing production is necessary, and saving is also necessary. Of course, there are many other reasons for increasing production and practicing economy.

Increasing production and practicing economy must be combined together, and must also be combined with all parties and all aspects. Launching a strong mass movement, on the one hand, eliminates waste, and on the other hand, must try to give full play to the potential capacity in agriculture and industrial and mining enterprises, and improve labor organization and production methods for workers and peasants. For example, the Li Shunda mutual aid group in agriculture, the Ma Hengchang production team in industry, Jiang Wanshou, Zhang Shuyun, Hao Jianxiu, etc. in light industry are endless. These are all vanguards of New China's construction who deserve great praise. We must continue to work hard.

Under the great call of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, the national industrial and commercial circles have improved their business enthusiasm, relied on workers, improved enterprises, and have shown enthusiastic performance in increasing production, donating money, and actively paying taxes. The patriotic wave of the industrial and commercial circles has greatly risen.

All workers, peasants, miners, and general workers, stand up! All entrepreneurs, stand up! All the people of the country, stand up! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must do our best to exert the untapped or not fully exerted land, materials, and human resources; at the same time, under the two conditions of not harming health and not hindering work, we must do our best to save the use of materials and human resources. We must accept Chairman Mao's instructions on practicing strict economy and add them to the patriotic conventions. Everyone should strive to consolidate the existing victories in Resist-America, Aid-Korea, further complete this sacred mission, and strive for the successful construction of an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong New China and the realization of lasting world peace.

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army of Resist-America, Aid-Korea!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Speech by Ma Yinchu, Representative of Non-Party Democrats

Strive to Complete the Task of Resist-America, Aid-Korea Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao

Chairman, Vice Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

On behalf of the non-party democrats, I express my warm support for the report of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on the Resist-America, Aid-Korea, Defend-Home-and-Country movement. We must exert all our strength to complete this task. I also represent the non-party democrats in extending the most sublime respect to the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army who are fighting heroically in Korea.

In September 1949, Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The Chinese people have stood up from now on." But in the short span of two years, the People's Republic of China has become such a powerful and unified democratic country that it can beat the American imperialists to a pulp. So today, the Chinese people have not only stood up, but have also stood on the head of American imperialism. Resist-America, Aid-Korea, Defend-Home-and-Country is a strategy jointly decided by the democratic parties in the country. But since Resist-America, Aid-Korea, what we have done is not only defending our homes and country, but also defending the security of the Far East, defending world peace, and defending human culture. Under the call of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, Defend-Home-and-Country, under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are unprecedentedly united. No matter men, women, old or young, no matter which class, almost all have participated in this patriotic movement, have been educated in patriotism, have raised their political awareness and revolutionary confidence, and have displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and internationalist spirit.

The climax of patriotism is manifested in the formulation and implementation of patriotic conventions. Patriotic conventions are weapons created in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. They concretize the patriotic enthusiasm of the people and promote various practical tasks. The best example is the great strength of the peasants shown in the Huai River project this time. The competition movement of one climax after another shown in the earthwork project is the result of the combination of patriotic enthusiasm and practical work.

The climax of patriotism has also promoted the nationwide movement to donate aircraft and cannons. This movement has been popularized to all regions and all classes of the country.

Culturally, this patriotic education has also smoothly and thoroughly eliminated the American imperialists' cultural aggression activities against our country for many years, so the ideas of pro-American, worshiping-American, and fearing-American will also be gradually eliminated cleanly. The remaining forces of American imperialism in China can be said to be completely eradicated. The days of humiliating the Chinese people are gone forever.

The above are all the gains from the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. American imperialism vainly attempts to give us a blow, but it does not know that it is itself that is really being hit.

American imperialism vainly attempts to strangle us with "blockade" and "embargo." This dream has also completely failed. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have completely changed the face of China at an incredible speed, and are still changing it:

(1) We have changed from a colony to a truly independent country;

(2) From disunity to peaceful unity;

(3) From disaster and poverty to prosperity;

(4) From land concentrated in the hands of a few people to land distributed among the masses of peasants;

(5) From chaotic finances to financial revenue and expenditure approaching balance;

(6) From a psychology of worshiping imperialism to a psychology of hating and despising imperialism;

(7) From cultural backwardness to gradual progress;

(8) From the people having no rights to people's democracy;

(9) Students with very strong individualistic thoughts, under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, have changed into students who disregard all sacrifices, dare to brave all difficulties, obey the government's allocation, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

(10) The Chiang Kai-shek army, which fled at the first battle, has become the heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army.

We have had such great victories in the military, economic, cultural, and political fields in these short two years. American imperialism knows that China has undergone earth-shaking changes, but American imperialism still closes its eyes and refuses to take a look. How can it not fail? Its ignorance is just like the medieval missionaries who resolutely did not believe the truth that "the earth revolves around the sun." How can it not fail?

But comrades, we must know that the great struggle task of Resist-America, Aid-Korea has not yet been completed. To achieve the final victory, we must continue to carry out a long-term struggle. Regardless of the opposition of China, the Soviet Union, and the people of the world, American imperialism brazenly signed the illegal "peace treaty with Japan" and is now actively arming Japan, vainly attempting to launch a large-scale invasion of our country and other Asian countries. Therefore, American imperialism's conspiracy to expand the war still threatens our country and the people of other countries in Asia. Therefore, the people of the whole of China must resolutely fight to the end to smash American imperialism's aggression plan. We must be determined to defeat American imperialism, be determined to permanently defend the security of our motherland, prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression, and liberate Taiwan from the aggressors. We will never give up until we achieve our goal.

Chairman Mao has led us correctly for more than 20 years. We must follow him closely. Let us shout:

Long live Resist-America, Aid-Korea!

Long live the Volunteer Army fighting heroically in Korea!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao, long live, long long live!

Speech by Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Workers Across the Country Support the Call to Increase Production and Practice Economy to Resist-America, Aid-Korea

Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow representatives:

I represent the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in expressing our complete agreement and complete support for the report of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea General Association on the Resist-America, Defend-Home-and-Country Movement.

The Chinese working class and the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, overthrew the imperialist rule over China for more than a century and the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang after thirty years of long struggle, and established the People's Republic of China. The facts of the past two years have fully proved what Chairman Mao said at the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

"Our nation will no longer be an insulted nation, we have stood up." But American imperialism has always held a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and is even more unwilling to have its privileges of enslaving the Chinese people eradicated. After failing to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launch a civil war against the Chinese people with a large number of weapons such as aircraft, cannons, tanks, warships, a large number of US dollars, and a large number of advisors and secret agents, it openly sent troops to invade Korea, occupied our Taiwan, and attempted to repeat the road of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China.

The Chinese working class and all the people, in order to defend their hard-won victories and the security of their motherland, organized the People's Volunteer Army to go to the Korean front in a situation where they could no longer bear it, and supported the just war of the Korean people. In the past year, thanks to the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, they have achieved great victories, severely hit the American aggressors, and forced them to conduct armistice negotiations. However, the American aggressors are still unwilling to accept their own defeat, and are still doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, and illegally conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, desperately rearming Japan, and persisting in and expanding its crazy aggressive conspiracy. This has further increased the hatred of the people across the country for American imperialism and the determination to resist America and aid Korea.

The Chinese working class has promoted the great spirit of patriotism in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea patriotic movement. The heroic railway workers, car drivers, telecommunications personnel, and medical workers have rushed to sign up to join the volunteer service team, and went to the Korean front, becoming an important part of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and fighting heroically, movingly, and stubbornly with the American invading army together with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The workers and staff in factories and mines in the rear have launched patriotic labor competitions everywhere, and have worked day and night, treating "the factory as the battlefield and the tools as weapons." The workers in the Northeast have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Gao Gang's call to increase grain production by five million tons, and now the amount of planned increase in production and savings has exceeded ten million tons. On the basis of this increase in production and savings, the movement to donate aircraft and cannons has been enthusiastically launched everywhere. The workers and friends of the Liulihe Cement Plant in Beijing alone have decided to donate two aircraft within half a year, donating an average of 3 million yuan per person. As of the end of September, the workers in Shanghai alone had paid 50 billion yuan. Young workers in various places have enthusiastically participated in various military cadre schools under the call of the People's Government, and the number of applicants has exceeded the original quota by several times. We know that all of this is the responsibility of every Chinese people, and it is the effort that every compatriot who is willing to build a truly independent, prosperous, happy, and great motherland should make.

In the future, we must work together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao, unite well, actively increase production and practice economy, and strive to build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force! Strive to support the People's Volunteer Army, strive for the victorious conclusion of Resist-America, Aid-Korea! Strive to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Speech by Han En, Representative of Agricultural Labor Models

Guarantee the Implementation of Patriotic Conventions, Strive to Increase Production to Support the Volunteer Army

After listening to Comrade Peng Zhen's report on Resist-America, Aid-Korea, I was very excited. Our motherland is already an invincible and powerful country. Our Volunteer Army is disciplined, brave in combat, and makes the American devils tremble with fear. People all over the world praise us one by one. We are unspeakably happy in our hearts. We farmers completely agree with Comrade Peng Zhen's report. We know that defending our home requires defending our country. To preserve the good life we have now and to build a better life in the future, we must help Korea defeat the American aggression, so that it cannot learn from the Japanese devils and enter China from Korea, and we must completely defeat its ambition to occupy Korea. I am from the Northeast, very close to Korea. We know very well the brutal behavior of the American devils in Korea. American planes often come to the Northeast to strafe and bomb. The American robbers are more ferocious and cruel than the Japanese devils.

Speaking of the Japanese devils, that is a hatred that can never be forgotten. As far as the sixteen agricultural labor models who participated in this meeting are concerned, everyone has been harmed by the Japanese devils. For example, the family of Lu Hongbin's sister, because there was a hunting gun, six of the seven members of the family were killed by the Japanese, and only one escaped. His father also died in a Japanese prison. And the number of fellow villagers who died tragically at the hands of the Japanese devils is even impossible to calculate. The common people hate the Japanese devils to the bone. But now the American devils are going to take the old road of Japan again. He is also arming Japan to join him. We can't let him come again. We Chinese people have stood up and have the power to defend our great motherland.

When our farmers heard that the American devils were going to rearm Japan, their eyes turned red with anger. They enthusiastically responded to the call to donate aircraft and cannons, and successively formulated plans to increase production and donate. Taking a few of us as an example: The Li Shunda mutual aid group donated more than 510,000. The Qu Yaoli group donated 60 jin of cotton, and he also donated 1,400 jin of wheat himself. The Zhang Xishun group donated 5,450 jin of millet. The Deng Guozhang group donated more than 1 million yuan, and also donated more than 2,000 jin of grain. The Lu Hongbin group donated more than 1.8 million yuan, and our group also donated 9.7 million yuan. These things we donated were all taken out of increased production and did not touch the old capital.

Today, after listening to Comrade Peng Zhen's report, we have more confidence in defeating the American devils. We will definitely strengthen the work of Resist-America, Aid-Korea after we go back. The forty-four labor models who came to Beijing this time have formulated a patriotic convention, which includes the following:

1.

    人民政协全国委员会第三次会议二十四日会上各界代表发言全文
    编者按：十月二十四日中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上发言的，有李云汉、李济深、章伯钧、黄炎培、马寅初、刘宁一、韩恩、吴耀宗等八人，他们的发言全文如下：
    人民志愿军战斗英雄代表李云汉发言
    志愿军越战越强有足够力量战胜敌人主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    周总理和抗美援朝总会彭副主席的报告，给我们说明了当前的形势，指出了今后的任务，我们表示完全拥护。我们回到自己的战斗岗位以后，一定坚决遵照执行。
    我们在朝鲜战场上，协同朝鲜人民军，打击美国侵略者，作战已经一年了，把敌人从鸭绿江边打到了三八线一带，经过大小无数次的战斗，共计消灭了敌人三十八万多人。虽然我们的装备不如敌人，我们各方面的条件有很多困难，但是终究还是打败了敌人，而且消灭的敌人一次比一次加多。这就看出我们的力量越打越强，而敌人是越打越弱了。现在前线的同志们信心很强。士气很高，大家都觉得：打了这一年了，已经摸着敌人的底了，战胜敌人是更有把握了。
    这一年以来，我们国内也展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动。全国人民爱国的热情空前地提高了，用了极大的力量来支援我们在朝鲜作战。工业农业方面实行了爱国生产竞赛。对我们的家属照顾得很好，各地的人民热烈地慰劳志愿军。特别是捐献飞机大炮的运动，四个多月就捐献了两千多架飞机，这个数目是很大的。前线的同志们听到这些消息以后，都非常高兴，大家打击美帝国主义的决心更大了，胜利的信心也更高了。将来我们装备更加改善，我们一定能够消灭更多的敌人，那时候美帝国主义就会遭受比现在更惨痛的失败。
    美帝国主义这一年来虽然在朝鲜战场上被我们打得头破血流，遭受了惨重的损失，可是它还不肯死心，还不肯停止它的侵略战争，这一点从朝鲜的停战谈判看得很明显，它一方面被迫同意谈判，另一方面又用各种阴谋手段来破坏谈判，拖延谈判，使谈判拖了几个月，到现在还是没有一点结果。美帝国主义的侵略野心我们是看透了，我们也准备和它进行长期作战。如果它仍然不接受教训，不肯用和平方法解决朝鲜问题，我们就坚决给它更重大的打击，直到取得完全胜利。我们不但有战胜敌人的坚强的决心，而且有战胜敌人的足够的力量。
    这次我们回到祖国来，参加了国庆节的观礼，看到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席，看到了我们祖国的强大力量，看到了祖国人民的爱国热潮，也受到祖国人民热烈的欢迎。现在我们又列席了这次政治协商会议的全国委员会，听到各位首长的重要报告，使我们更加感到祖国的可爱和我们责任的重大。我们要向各位首长、各位委员和全国人民表示决心：我们回到前线以后，一定要打好仗，多消灭敌人，为人民立功，为祖国增光。我们一定要以反侵略战争的胜利来保卫我们可爱的祖国，保卫亚洲与全世界的和平。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深发言
    民革竭诚拥护增产节约加强抗美援朝主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    我在发言的开始，首先要郑重表示，我愿意代表中国国民党革命委员会对昨天毛主席在本会议上的开会词所指示的，完全竭诚拥护。其次，我们完全同意昨天周恩来总理的政治报告，同意今天陈叔通副主席关于全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    我听了抗美援朝总会彭真副主席关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告，感到无比的兴奋。一年来，中国人民和朝鲜人民一道，在全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和支援下，不仅在朝鲜战场上，直接给了美帝国主义以严重的打击，在全世界人民的面前戳穿了它是一只纸老虎，证明它是完全可以打败的；而且随着抗美援朝运动普遍和深入地展开，全国各民族、各党派、各阶层人民、各界人士更加亲密团结起来，全国人民的爱国主义思想更空前的提高，大家都把爱国的热情贯注在自己的具体工作中，使我们伟大祖国各方面的建设，特别是国防建设，在一年来获得了空前辉煌的成就。
    我们首先要向中国人民最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军致敬！特别向今天在座的战斗英雄们致敬！他们发挥英勇善战刻苦耐劳无比的战斗精神，和朝鲜人民军一道，把美国侵略军从鸭绿江边打回到三八线附近，不但保障了祖国的安全，保护了祖国的建设，而且鼓舞了全世界人民，特别是亚洲人民，保卫和平反对侵略的斗争意志和胜利信心，为祖国争取了无上的光荣，这是值得我们全国人民骄傲的。
    我们还要向带头发动爱国主义生产竞赛的工业农业劳动模范们致敬！他们在国内生产战线上的胜利，加强了朝鲜战场上的胜利。
    我们还要向全世界爱好和平的人民致敬！特别向伟大的苏联人民致敬！他们正义的同情和声援，加强了我们斗争的意志和力量，我们抗美援朝的胜利，也就是全世界人民保卫和平反对侵略的胜利！
    我们中国人民和美国军队作战，是因为美国政府派兵占领了我们的台湾、侵略朝鲜和侵犯到了我国的东北边疆。我们是坚决地要和平，但我们有力量把侵略者打退。所以美帝国主义一天不知难而退，不接受和平，我们就一天不停止斗争！因此，我们中国人民就必须把抗美援朝运动更向前推进一步，而首要的任务就是扩大和加强我们的增产节约运动，发挥我们无穷无尽的力量，准备和美帝国主义作长期的斗争，实现朝鲜问题的和平解决，并且我们一定要从美国侵略者的手中，解放我们神圣的国土台湾！
    一年来，由于工人农民积极地进行爱国主义的生产竞赛和全国人民一致地努力展开了热烈的捐献运动，我们的国防力量已空前地加强和巩固，显出了中国人民伟大的不可战胜的力量。但是我们的力量是不是完全充分发挥出来了呢？没有！我们还有极雄厚、伟大、不可衡量的力量没有发挥出来。我们必须号召全国人民一致奋起坚决地实行增产、反对浪费，把所有的力量都充分地发挥出来，大家都订出自己的增产节约计划，贯彻在爱国公约之中，把爱国的热情通过增产节约，全部变为伟大的物质力量，这种力量不仅可以战胜帝国主义者的任何侵略，加速抗美援朝最后胜利的来临，使我们在保卫世界和平的事业中，作出更伟大的贡献；而且将为我们伟大祖国的基本建设奠定坚强的基础，创造新的繁荣并加速我们国家逐渐走入工业化。
    从一年来各方面的胜利，使我们更加认识了人民民主专政制度的绝对优越，更加认识了毛泽东思想的伟大，我们的胜利就是人民民主专政的胜利，也就是毛泽东思想的胜利！我们民革全体同志一定和全国人民一道，有组织、有系统地来学习“毛泽东选集”，在全党掀起一个学习毛泽东思想新的高潮，来改造我们的思想，加强我们的工作，更好的团结在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，胜利前进！
    我听了郭沫若副主席代表常务委员会提出的关于抗美援朝工作的决议案，愿意代表中国国民党革命委员会表示完全同意和坚决拥护，我将号召民革全体同志身体力行，推动自己所联系的群众和号召广大人民，把抗美援朝增产节约当作我们当前最主要的政治任务，坚决努力，为完全实现这个决议而奋斗！
    中国人民抗美援朝运动胜利万岁！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    全亚洲人民和全世界人民反对侵略保卫和平运动胜利万岁！
    全世界人民领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国民主同盟秘书长章伯钧发言
    号召盟员参加增产节约抗美援朝运动主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们在今天第二次大会上听到了抗美援朝总会彭真副主席和郭沫若主席分别报告抗美援朝的工作和关于进行抗美援朝工作的决议，我代表中国民主同盟表示彻底的拥护并号召全体盟员以积极的实际行动来完成这个任务。
    “中国人民志愿军代表着中国人民的伟大意志”，以排山倒海的力量，于一九五○年十月二十五日跨过鸭绿江，击溃了当时迫近鸭绿江边的美帝国主义的侵略军，把敌人赶到三八线附近，使美帝国主义及其仆从国家遭受了惨重的损失，挫败了美帝国主义并吞朝鲜、侵略中国、统治亚洲和征服世界的野心；而同时全世界，全亚洲，和全中国爱好和平反对侵略的人民则获得了无限的鼓舞，加强了团结，以至增长了战胜一切帝国主义、保卫世界和平的信心和力量。
    同志们：我们中国人民有了这样光辉胜利的形势，并不是一件偶然的事情呀！今天是十月二十四日，明天就是中国人民志愿军抗美援朝整整一周年的光荣而伟大的纪念日了；我们要向劳苦功高的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致亲切的敬意和慰问，我们要向伟大的领导者毛主席和中国共产党致崇高的敬意，我们要向全世界爱好和平的人民和伟大的斯大林大元帅致崇高的敬意。
    同志们：美帝国主义者，在他死亡的末日未到来以前，是不甘心失败的；同时，我们中国人民在没有解放台湾以前，决不会放弃反对美帝国主义侵略台湾的责任。毛主席在昨天开会词中，曾指出了一条真理，那就是：“抗美援朝的伟大斗争现在还在继续进行，并且必须继续进行到美国政府愿意和平解决的时候为止。……为了继续坚持这个必要的正义的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务”。毛主席这一英明正确的指示，全中国人民，包括各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体，以及一切爱国民主人士都是无条件的拥护的，和欣然接受的；并将以实际的行动来保证完成这个中心任务的。这两年来，全国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导和团结之下，参加了土地改革、镇压反革命和抗美援朝三大运动，而收获了巨大的成效与进步，就是具体的证明。
    同志们：周总理在政治报告中，指出了“人民民主统一战线，组成了数亿人民自觉的有组织的队伍。……使国内各界人民从各个战线上，自愿团结在爱国公约的运动中，团结在国际主义和爱国主义相结合的抗美援朝战争中，使我们在朝鲜前线进行胜利作战的人民志愿军获得了人力物力和技术上有力的援助。”这一贤明的指示是非常重要的，是动员全国人民最有力的组织形式。我们在支援抗美援朝和解放台湾的长期奋斗中，固然应尽力发挥统一战线的力量，即使在生产建设，发展工农业和文化教育工作的时期，统一战线的政策，是同样起重大作用的，不可缺少的。
    同志们：在当前新的胜利形势下，摆在全中国人民面前，特别在我们各民主党派、人民团体和广大的爱国民主人士面前，有一个最急切的重要的问题，就是我们应如何依靠着工人阶级政党中国共产党来胜利地执行毛主席所交给我们的中心任务，分开来说，第一：我们应如何更密切的进一步地团结在毛主席的光辉的旗帜之下，把全中国人民更普遍更深入地动员起来？第二：我们应如何在广泛动员运动中做好节约生产的工作？我们都知道，今年东北人民在节约生产号召之下，已计划增产一千万吨以上的粮食。这是一笔巨大的财富，一件重大的成绩呀！若是我们全国人民都能依照东北人民的先进的经验，一致地用爱国公约的形式组织起来，每一个党政机关、每一个武装部队、每一个学校、每一个生产单位都按照毛主席的指示，检查工作，编订节约生产计划；那末，我们可能而且必能创造和获得的国家财富，将达到无以估量的惊人的数目，这正是打倒美帝国主义的真实的物质基础，真实的力量。
    同时，我们必须加强思想战线的工作。曾经长期在封建主义和帝国主义统治之下的中国人民，现在在思想战线上，有巨大的任务。我们应当发动一个认真的思想批判的运动，把那些崇美，亲美，恐美的思想，封建残余的思想，以及旧民主主义思想都要予以必要的清除，批判和教育改造；经过这种思想改造工作以后，全国人民的团结将更加巩固、抗美援朝的力量将更加壮大；由新民主主义建设的完成，达到社会主义建设的实现，将更有顺利的基础。因此，第一：我们为了响应周总理的号召，希望人民政协全国委员会要以全力协助各民主党派、各人民团体和爱国民主人士认真地组织和推动努力学习毛泽东选集的运动，特别作为一九五二年各民主党派发展组织与巩固组织的基本任务。第二：我们希望人民政协全国委员会会同中共中央统战部筹设“毛泽东学院”选收各民主党派，人民团体的干部和爱国民主人士以及外国有志来学的青年，进行马列主义毛泽东思想的教育工作。
    同志们：中国人民经过这样思想和行动的锻炼，团结在胜利的光辉的毛泽东旗帜之下，是光荣的，有力量的，有无限前途的，一定能够打倒美帝国主义，保卫世界和平，完成毛主席所交给我们的中心任务。
    中国人民志愿军朝鲜人民军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    民主建国会召集人黄炎培发言
    拥护增产节约号召加强抗美援朝工作主席：同志们：
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议日程中间，恰好包含着抗美援朝一周年的纪念日，毛主席在开会词里指示我们：“需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务”，这是很必要的，也很切当的。我们一致拥护。
    中国的抗美援朝，为的是制止美帝国主义侵略。只有抵抗，才能争取和平，这是在各民主党派联合宣言中间，说得清清楚楚的。经过了一年来的努力，美帝国主义在损兵，折将，易帅之后，已经表现出极度狼狈了，可是，我们不能停留在初步的胜利之上，古人说的：“行百里者半九十”，我们还得好好地继续努力。
    在过去一年中间，全国人民认识了抗美援朝伟大的意义，崇高的使命，在后方工作上，表现出种种积极地一致的行动，首先是在热烈的爱国运动之下，大大地增加了生产，当然，这是和新中国的经济建设政策相配合的。无论从经济建设观点出发，从抗美援朝观点出发，都在一方面要求增加生产，一方面还在要求节约使用。
    且把几种日常消费品来做个例子吧！纱布、在今年——一九五一年产量可以超过战前最高额。分析起来，今年上半年，纱、已经比较去年增产了百分之三十，布、增产了百分之二十四点五。纸、一九五一年计划产量比较战前最高额提高到百分之一百五十五，实际上全国公营造纸厂一月至七月，生产已超过了百分之五点三七。烤烟叶、今年产量比较战前最高额增加到百分之一百三十点五，比去年增加到四倍以上。生产是大大地增加了，但是，就拿纸烟来说吧！假定全国人口五分之一每人每天多吸一枝纸烟，那么照今年这样多的纸烟生产量，还缺少三分之一。这只是一个例子。
    增产是必要的，节约也是必要的。当然在这些以外，还有不少增产节约的理由哩。
    增产和节约，是要双方配合起来努力的，还要和各方各面配合起来努力的。展开了群众性的强烈运动，一方面消除了浪费，一方面还得尽力发挥农业和工矿企业中间的潜在能力，改进工农劳动组织和生产方法，例如农业李顺达互助组，工业马恒昌生产小组，轻工业姜万寿、张淑云、郝建秀等等说是说不尽的，这些都是值得大大赞扬的新中国建设的先锋队。我们要继续努力。
    全国工商界，在伟大的抗美援朝号召之下，提高了经营积极性，依靠工人，改善企业，在增产捐献和踊跃纳税上边，都有了热烈的表现，工商界爱国主义的浪潮，已经大大地高涨了。
    全国工农矿和一般工作同志们起来！全国企业家起来！全国人民起来！我们要在毛主席领导下，竭尽可能，来发挥没有发挥的，或没有尽量发挥的地力物力和人力；同时在不损害健康和不妨碍工作两条件之下，竭尽可能，来节约物力和人力的使用。我们要接受毛主席厉行节约的指示，补充在爱国公约上边。大家为了巩固抗美援朝既得的胜利，进一步完成这神圣使命，来争取独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国的建设成功和全世界持久和平的实现而奋斗。
    中国抗美援朝人民志愿军万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    无党派民主人士代表马寅初发言
    在毛主席领导下努力完成抗美援朝任务主席、副主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我代表无党派民主人士，对于彭真副主席关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告表示热烈的拥护。我们一定要发挥一切力量来完成这个任务。我也代表无党派民主人士对在朝鲜英勇作战的志愿军和朝鲜人民军致以最崇高的敬意。
    一九四九年九月毛主席在中国人民政协第一届全体会议上的开幕词中说“中国人从此站立起来了。”但在短短的二年当中，中华人民共和国竟变成了一个这样强大的统一的民主国家，能把美帝国主义打得落花流水。所以在今天中国人民不但已经站起来了，且已经站在美帝国主义的头上了。抗美援朝保家卫国是国内各民主党派所共同决定的策略。但自抗美援朝以来，我们所做的不仅仅是保家卫国，我们也保卫了远东的安全，保卫了世界的和平，保卫了人类的文化，在抗美援朝保家卫国的号召之下，在毛主席的英明的正确的领导之下，全国的人民空前地团结起来了，无论男女老小，无论那个阶级几乎全体都参加了这次爱国运动，受到了爱国主义的教育，提高了政治觉悟和革命信心，发挥了高度的爱国热诚和国际主义的精神。
    爱国主义的高潮表现在爱国公约的订立与执行，爱国公约是抗美援朝运动中所创造出来的武器，它使人民的爱国热情具体化，推动了各种实际工作。最好的例子就是这次治淮的工程中所表现的农民伟大的力量。土方工程中所表现的一个高潮接着一个高潮的竞赛运动就是爱国热情与实际工作相结合的结果。
    爱国主义的高潮也推动了全国规模的捐献飞机大炮的运动，这一运动，已普及全国各地区，各阶层。
    在文化上，这个爱国主义教育也顺利地彻底地肃清了美帝国主义对我国多年的文化侵略的活动，因此亲美崇美恐美的思想也就会逐步地被消灭得干干净净。美帝国主义在中国的残余势力可说是连根拔掉了。要侮辱中国人民的日子已一去不复返了。
    以上种种都是抗美援朝运动中所得到的收获，美帝国主义妄想予我以打击，殊不知真正受到打击的还是它自己。
    美帝国主义妄想以“封锁”“禁运”来厄死我们，这个梦想也完全失败了，我们在毛主席的领导之下，已经把中国的面貌以令人难以相信的速度完全改变了，而且仍在改变着：
    （一）我们由殖民地变为真正的独立国；
    （二）由不统一变为和平统一；
    （三）由灾荒贫困变为欣欣向荣；
    （四）由土地集中于少数人手中变为土地分散于农民群众；
    （五）由紊乱的财政变为财政收支接近平衡；
    （六）由崇拜帝国主义的心理变为仇恨鄙视帝国主义的心理；
    （七）由文化落后变为日趋进步；
    （八）由人民无权变为人民民主；
    （九）由个人思想很浓厚的学生，在教育部领导之下，一变而为不顾一切牺牲，甘冒一切困难，服从政府分配，全心全意为人民服务的学生。
    （十）由一战就逃的蒋介石军队变为英勇善战天下无敌的解放军。
    我们在这短短的二年中，在军事上，经济上，文化上，政治上有这样伟大的胜利，美帝国主义所知道的中国已经起了翻天覆地的变化，而美帝国主义仍闭着眼睛不肯看一看，岂有不失败之理？它的愚昧真如中世纪的传教师，坚决不信“地球绕太阳转动”真理一样，那有不失败之理？
    但是同志们，我们要晓得抗美援朝的伟大斗争任务，还没有完成，要取得最后的胜利必须继续进行长期的奋斗。美帝国主义不顾中国、苏联以及世界人民的反对，悍然签订了非法的“对日和约”，现在积极武装日本，妄想大举侵略我国和亚洲其他国家。因此美帝国主义扩大战争的阴谋，仍然威胁着我国和亚洲其他各国人民。因此全中国的人民必须为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划而坚决奋斗到底。我们一定要下决心击败美帝国主义，要下决心永久保卫祖国的安全，防止日本侵略的再起，从侵略者手中解放台湾，不达到目的，决不罢休。
    毛主席领导我们二十多年，都是正确的，我们要紧紧密密地跟着他走，让我们高呼：
    抗美援朝万岁！
    在朝鲜英勇作战的志愿军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁万岁万万岁！
    中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一发言
    全国工人拥护增产节约抗美援朝号召主席、诸位委员、诸位代表同志们：
    我代表中华全国总工会表示完全同意、完全拥护抗美援朝总会彭真副主席关于抗美援朝、保家卫国运动的报告。
    中国工人阶级和中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，经过三十年的长期奋斗，方才推翻帝国主义百余年来对中国的统治和国民党反动政权，建立了中华人民共和国。两年来的事实，完全证明了毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议开幕时的说话：
    “我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站立起来了。”但美帝国主义对于中国人民的革命斗争，一贯地抱着敌视态度，对于帝国主义奴役中国人民的特权的被铲除更不甘心。在以大量飞机、大炮、坦克、军舰等武器，大批的美元，大群的顾问、特务帮助蒋介石匪帮发动进攻中国人民的内战失败之后，又公然出兵进攻朝鲜，侵占我国台湾，企图重走日本帝国主义侵略中国的道路。
    中国工人阶级与全体人民，为了保卫既得的胜利果实与祖国的安全，在忍无可忍的情况之下，组织人民志愿军奔赴朝鲜前线，支援朝鲜人民的正义战争。一年以来由于中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军的英勇作战，已经获得了伟大的胜利，给美国侵略者以严重的打击，迫使它不得不进行停战谈判。但是美国侵略者还不甘心它自己的失败，还在百般阻挠和破坏朝鲜的停战谈判，并非法缔结单独对日和约，拚命地重新武装日本，坚持和扩大其疯狂的侵略阴谋。这就更增加了我们全国人民对美帝国主义的仇恨和抗美援朝的决心。
    中国工人阶级在抗美援朝爱国运动中发扬了伟大的爱国主义精神，英勇的铁路工人、汽车司机、电讯人员、医务工作者，争先恐后地报名参加志愿服务队，开到了朝鲜前线，成了中国人民志愿军的一个重要组成部分，与中国人民志愿军一起和美国侵略军作着英勇的可歌可泣的顽强斗争。在后方厂矿中的工人职员群众，到处都展开了爱国主义的劳动竞赛，都把“工厂当作战场，工具当作武器”日以继夜劳动着。东北的工人兄弟们，热烈地响应了高岗主席增产五百万吨粮食的号召，现在计划增产节约的数目已超过了一千万吨。在这种增产节约的基础上，各处都热烈地展开了捐献飞机、大炮的运动，光北京琉璃河水泥厂一个工厂的工友就决定在半年之内捐献两架飞机，平均每人捐献达三百万元。截至九月底止光上海工人缴纳五百亿元。各地青年工人，在人民政府的号召下踊跃参加各种军事干部学校，报名的人数都超过原定名额几倍。我们知道，所有这一切都是每个中国人民应尽的责任，都是每个愿意建设真正独立、富强、幸福的伟大祖国的同胞所应尽的努力。
    我们今后更要与全国人民一道，在中国共产党和伟大的毛主席领导下，好好地团结一致，积极增产节约，为建设一个强大的国防力量和强大的经济力量而奋斗！为支援人民志愿军、为争取抗美援朝的胜利结束而奋斗！为保卫远东和世界和平而奋斗！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    农业劳动模范代表韩恩发言
    保证实现爱国公约努力增产支援志愿军
    听了彭真同志抗美援朝的报告，非常兴奋，我们的祖国已经是一个不可战胜的强大国家了。我们的志愿军纪律严明，作战英勇，打得美国鬼子胆战心寒，全世界人民个个称赞，我们心眼里有说不出的高兴。对彭真同志的报告，我们农民完全同意。我们知道保家必须卫国，要保住现在的好日子，建设将来更好的生活，就必须援助朝鲜打败美国的侵略，使它不能再学日本鬼子那样从朝鲜打进中国来，而且连它占领朝鲜的野心也要彻底打垮。我是东北人，离朝鲜很近，美国鬼子在朝鲜的残暴行为，我们知道的很清楚，美国飞机还经常到东北扫射轰炸，美国强盗比日本鬼子还凶恶、还残忍。
    一提起日本鬼子，那真是永远不能忘记的仇恨，就我们参加这次会议的十六个农业劳动模范说，个个都受过日本鬼子的害。如吕鸿宾的姐姐家，因为有一只打猎枪，全家七口中六口人被日本杀死，只一人逃了出来。他的父亲也死在日本监狱。而老乡们惨死在日本鬼子手里的更无法计算。老百姓对日本鬼子真是咬牙切齿恨透了。可是现在美国鬼子又要走日本的老路，他还武装日本跟他一块来，我们可再不能让他来了，我们中国人民已经站起来了，完全有力量保卫我们伟大的祖国。
    我们农民听说美国鬼子要重新武装日本，眼都气红了，热烈响应捐献飞机大炮的号召，纷纷订立了增产捐献计划，加紧生产，就拿我们中的几个人来说：李顺达互助组捐了五十一万多。曲耀离小组捐了六十斤皮棉，他自己还捐了一千四百斤麦子，张希顺小组捐小米五千四百五十斤，邓国章小组捐了
    一百多万元，还捐了两千多斤粮食，吕鸿宾小组捐了一百八十多万元，我们小组也捐了九百七十万元。我们所捐的这些东西都是从增产中拿出来的，并没有动着老本。
    今天听了彭真同志的报告，对打败美国鬼子更有信心，回去后一定加强抗美援朝工作。我们这次来北京的四十四个劳动模范已订了个爱国公约，里面有这样几条：
    一、继续深入开展农村抗美援朝运动，把爱国和生产密切结合起来，努力增产，厉行节约，支援中国人民志愿军，并协助政府作好拥军、代耕工作。
    二、自己做到并带动互助组及其他农民制订明年的具体生产计划，积极参加爱国主义丰产竞赛运动，保证进一步提高生产，供给国家更多的粮食、棉花和其他工业原料，在畜牧区要多增殖牲畜。
    三、巩固和提高自己的互助组织，宣传它的好处，介绍各地互助组的经验，引导与帮助更多的农民组织起来。
    四、接受并推广科学技术和各地农民先进的丰产经验，提高生产技术，建立与健全村内和互助组内的技术研究委员会或小组，并尽先使用新式农具及药械。
    五、积极参加和发动农民兴修水利植树造林，防治病虫害及进行其他各项建设工作，战胜各种自然灾害。
    六、作到深耕、多耙、勤锄、选用良种、增施肥料、改良土壤，尽力把坡田修成梯田，增加单位面积的产量。
    我们保证爱国公约全部实现，组织起来发展生产，抓紧农闲，进行练兵，保证国家要粮有粮，要钱有钱，要人有人，坚决支援志愿军，把美国侵略军消灭在朝鲜。保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的好日子，保卫世界和平。
    敬爱的毛主席万岁！
    伟大的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    宗教界民主人士代表吴耀宗发言
    宗教信徒衷心拥护增产节约抗美援朝主席、各位委员，各位先生：
    我愿意代表全国的宗教信徒，对毛主席的开会词，对周总理的政治报告，对抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告和决议，表示衷心的拥护，并向英勇的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致最热烈、最崇高的敬礼。全中国的人民，以及全世界爱好和平的人民，都为他们在朝鲜所已经获得的辉煌的战果而欢欣。
    我今天站在这里，心中感到无限的兴奋与骄傲。在过去几千年历史中，中国人民，从来没有像今天那样的团结，从来没有像今天那样热爱他们的祖国，从来没有像今天那样，抱着充分的信心，准备着足够的力量，去打击任何敢来侵犯他们的敌人。
    美帝国主义错误地估计了中朝人民的力量，疯狂地发动了对朝鲜和我国领土台湾的侵略，但是今天，在朝鲜的战场上，它遭受了沉重的打击；它的灭绝人性的残暴行为，也引起了全世界爱好和平的人民无比的愤怒。在过去一年多当中，普遍深入的抗美援朝运动，使中国人民清楚地认识了美帝国主义丑恶狰狞的面目，清楚地认识了他们自己强大无比的力量。美帝国主义的侵略政策一天没有改变，中国人民抗美援朝的运动和建设国防的努力就一天不会停止。这个反对帝国主义的怒潮，不但在中国掀起了，也正在全世界增涨着。整个东南亚的革命运动，最近在中东和非洲几个国家的反帝运动，以及在帝国主义国家里的和平运动，都充分地证明了帝国主义已经临近了它的末日。中国人民抗美援朝的运动将有力地促进帝国主义最后的灭亡。
    我们绝大多数的宗教信徒是爱国的。在中国几个主要的宗教中，基督教和天主教都曾经受了帝国主义深刻的影响。直到今天，以美国为首的帝国主义还企图直接间接地利用基督教和天主教去进行它的破坏新中国的阴谋。但是全中国被解放以后，基督教和天主教也获得解放了。去年七月，基督教人士所发起的自治自养自传的革新运动得到全国基督徒热烈的响应。到目前为止，在革新宣言上签名的，已超过三十万人，占全国基督徒三分之一。这个革新运动是中国基督徒反帝爱国的有力表现，也是全世界基督教开始挣脱帝国主义枷锁的号角。随着基督教革新运动的发展，天主教的信徒也纷纷发起了三自革新运动。现在基督教和天主教在全国各地热烈地展开对帝国主义分子和教会败类的控诉。帝国主义披着宗教外衣来进行侵略的时代是过去了。从今以后，在政府正确领导之下，基督教和天主教都将走上光明的前途。
    在解放后的两年当中，全国宗教信徒的政治认识是大大地提高了。他们热烈地参加了抗美援朝运动和其他许多反帝爱国的群众运动。他们积极地推动了武器的捐献和优抚的工作；在佛教徒当中，还展开了一个劳动生产的运动。宗教信徒是酷爱和平的，而美帝国主义却是世界和平最凶狠的敌人。全国爱国爱教的宗教信徒目前最迫切的任务，就是响应政府“抗美援朝增产节约”的号召，去打击这个敌人，消灭这个敌人。必须这样，才能保障亚洲与世界和平；必须这样，才能建设繁荣富强的新中国；也只有这样，一切的宗教，才能在新中国的环境里健全地发展起来。
