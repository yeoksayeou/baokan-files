    Shijingshan Power Plant Workers Increase Production and Practice Economy to Support the Volunteer Army
    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:
    Your patriotism and internationalism have greatly inspired us in the rear.
    We would like to represent all the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant and give you a brief report on the achievements we have made on the production front over the past year.
    Since the anti-US aggression and aid-Korea campaign was launched in our factory, the face of production has been completely renewed. We have created a new record of 185 days of safe operation, the longest in the history of the power plant. Accidents have also been reduced unprecedentedly, from 38 in 1950 to 2 this year.
    The signing of the Patriotic Pact has enabled all the workers in the factory to engage in the patriotic labor production competition, which has not only improved production efficiency, but also greatly enhanced the class consciousness of the workers. In June of this year, the workers formulated a plan to increase production and donation for the second half of the year, deciding to increase the wealth of 1.5 million jin of millet for the country. By the end of September, 90% of this plan had been completed. In addition, everyone consciously and voluntarily donated their wages, bonuses and private savings, etc. It is estimated that 130,000 jin of millet will be donated in the second half of this year, and all of it has been completed by the end of September.
    As we celebrate the first anniversary of your departure, all of our employees are determined to earnestly implement the Patriotic Pact, to welcome high loads, and to overfulfill the task of increasing production and donation to support you.
    Shijingshan Power Plant Director, Labor Model Liu Yingyuan
    Union Vice Chairman, Labor Model Liu Dezhen

    Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    You have been away from your beloved motherland and hometown for a whole year. Every day we are eager to hear good news from the Korean front. After the news of smashing Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive" reached our ears, everyone was so excited that they almost shed tears. You are truly the most beloved people in the world! Let us extend to you the highest revolutionary salute!
    Over the past year, encouraged and driven by you, our group has also signed a patriotic pact and launched a patriotic production competition. In the vigorous donation campaign, we increased production and saved 40,000 jin of millet for the country from June to September, and donated a bonus of 5 million yuan. During the overhaul of a certain machine, with the help of Soviet experts, we solved technical difficulties, learned how to dismantle and repair generator rotors, and gradually mastered modern and complex technologies. Now, we have completed the annual maintenance task ahead of schedule.
    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades! We guarantee to commemorate the first anniversary of your departure to fight with greater victories in increasing production and practicing economy. We hope that in the near future, we can all send out greater and more glorious good news from different places. Please know how enthusiastically we are cheering for your great victory!
    Shijingshan Power Plant Liu Dezhen Group

### 石景山发电厂职工增产节约支援志愿军

专栏：读者来信

    石景山发电厂职工增产节约支援志愿军亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    一年来，你们的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，大大地鼓舞了我们后方的人们。
    我们愿代表石景山发电厂全体职工，把我们一年来在生产战线上所获得的成绩，向你们作一简单的报告。
    我厂自从掀起了抗美援朝运动以后，生产面貌即焕然一新。我们创造了发电厂有史以来的一百八十五天安全运转的新纪录。事故也空前减少，从一九五○年的三十八件减到今年的两件。
    爱国公约的订立，使全厂职工投入了爱国主义劳动生产竞赛，不但提高了生产效率，职工的阶级觉悟也空前提高了。今年六月，工友们订出了下半年的增产捐献计划，决定为国家增产一百五十万斤小米的财富。这一计划，至九月底，已完成了百分之九十。此外，大家还自觉自愿地捐献了自己的工资、奖金和私人积蓄等。今年下半年预计捐献十三万斤小米，至九月底业已全部完成。
    当此庆祝你们出国一周年的时候，我们全体职工决以认真执行爱国公约，迎接高负荷、超额完成增产捐献任务，来支援你们。
    石景山发电厂厂长、劳动模范  刘英源
    工会副主席、劳动模范    刘德珍亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志们：
    你们离开可爱的祖国和家乡，整整一年了。每天我们都在渴望着从朝鲜前线传来的捷报。粉碎范佛里特“秋季攻势”的消息传到我们的耳里后，大家都兴奋得快要流下泪来。你们真是世界上最可爱的人！让我们向你们致以最崇高的革命敬礼！
    一年来，在你们的鼓舞和带动下，我组也订立了爱国公约，开展着爱国主义生产竞赛。在轰轰烈烈的捐献运动中，我们从六月至九月给国家增产节约小米四万斤，捐献奖金五百万元。大修某号机时，在苏联专家的帮助下，我们解决了技术上的困难，学会了拆修发电机转子，逐渐掌握了近代化复杂的技术。现在，又提前完成了全年的检修任务。
    亲爱的志愿军同志们！我们保证用更大的增产节约的胜利来纪念你们出国作战一周年。希望在不久的将来，我们都能从不同的地方传出更伟大更光荣的捷报。请你们知道我们是在多么热烈地欢呼你们伟大的胜利吧！
    石景山发电厂刘德珍小组
