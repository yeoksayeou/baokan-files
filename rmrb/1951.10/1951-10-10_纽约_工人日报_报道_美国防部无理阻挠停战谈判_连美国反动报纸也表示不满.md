Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th: The New York "Worker's Daily" reported on October 3rd that even reactionary American newspapers are expressing anxiety about the unreasonable obstruction of the Korean armistice by senior generals in the U.S. Defense Department, and dissatisfaction with the U.S. government's concealment of the heavy losses suffered by the U.S. military in its adventurist invasion.

    The "New York Post" pointed out on October 2nd: "Since the beginning of the negotiations, there seems to be ample reason to believe" that the Koreans want to achieve a peaceful resolution. The paper said, "However, the negotiations have repeatedly stalled due to procedural and formal issues."

    The "New York Post" spoke of Washington's actions to obstruct the ceasefire negotiations: "At first, there was a great uproar because some reporters could not enter Kaesong; as soon as the Communists made concessions, most reporters immediately lined up to obey Washington."

    The "New York Post" said: Now, "the ambiguous issue of changing the venue for the resumption of negotiations has delayed the negotiations."

    The "New York Post" acknowledged that the Koreans hoped to achieve a ceasefire. It said, "If they do, then neither procedure nor formality should be a very important issue for us."

    Baldwin, the military commentator for the "New York Times," said on the same day that the communiqué of the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command not only failed to report the situation to the American people, but also "became a lottery bag for enemy casualty figures. The verbs and adjectives of so-called 'battles'... are often linked to statements, but with little factual proof." But on the other hand, the censorship system "has been very strict and often unreasonable."

    纽约“工人日报”报道
    美国防部无理阻挠停战谈判
    连美国反动报纸也表示不满
     【新华社布拉格九日电】纽约“工人日报”于十月三日报道，甚至美国的反动报纸对于美国国防部高级将领无理阻挠朝鲜休战也表示焦急，并对美国官方隐瞒美军在冒险进犯中所遭受的惨重损失表示不满。
    “纽约邮报”于十月二日指出：“自从谈判一开始，似乎就有充分的理由可以相信”朝鲜人希望获致和平解决，该报说：“但是，谈判屡次因程序和手续问题停顿下来。”
    “纽约邮报”谈到华盛顿阻挠休战谈判的行动说：“起初由于一些记者不能进入开城而大吵大闹；共产党一让步，大多数记者马上列队听命于华盛顿。”
    “纽约邮报”说：现在，“在恢复谈判时更换会址的暧昧问题已延宕了谈判”。
    “纽约邮报”承认朝鲜人希望获致休战。它说：“如果他们的确如此，那么不论程序或手续对我方说来都不应是任何很重要的问题。”
    “纽约时报”军事评论员鲍尔温于同日说，联合国军总司令的公报不但没有向美国人民报告情况，反而“成为敌人伤亡数字的摸彩袋了，所谓‘战斗’的动词与形容词……常常与声明连在一起，却很少事实作证明”。但另一方面，检查制度“却一直很严厉，并且时常不讲道理”。
