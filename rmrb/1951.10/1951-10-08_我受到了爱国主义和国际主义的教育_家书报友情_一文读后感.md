    I Received an Education in Patriotism and Internationalism - Reflections on "Family Letters Report Friendship"
    To the Editor:
    The article "Family Letters Report Friendship," published on page four of the September 27th People's Daily, is a vivid and touching foreign correspondence. I was deeply educated in internationalism and patriotism through it. Many of the things written in this correspondence are ordinary, everyday matters; however, it is these everyday things that depict the achievements our great motherland has obtained under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, achievements that have profoundly influenced fraternal countries.
    From the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea, in the four or five fraternal countries along the more than three thousand li route, everywhere is filled with love for Chairman Mao! As a youth of the Mao Zedong era, as a staff member of a Party newspaper, I feel very proud and honored.
    The love of workers and farmers in the Eastern European fraternal countries for the New China and the Volunteer Army is not accidental. This is because we have common goals and work for a common cause. This is the source of our close friendship. This friendship is the most precious and sublime in the world, which cannot be blocked by national borders or ethnicities, nor can it be affected by language or customs. I deeply realized this from the correspondence "Family Letters Report Friendship."
    This correspondence tells us: We should love our great motherland even more and contribute everything we have to it!

    我受到了爱国主义和国际主义的教育
    “家书报友情”一文读后感编辑同志：
    九月二十七日人民日报四版发表的“家书报友情”，是一篇内容生动感人的国外通讯。我从中深深地受到了国际主义和爱国主义的教育。这篇通讯内所写的有许多是普通的、日常的事情；然而正是这些日常的事情，刻划出了我们伟大的祖国在共产党和毛主席的领导下所获得的成就，这些成就，给予兄弟国家以深刻影响。
    从黑海到波罗的海，三千多里路程内的四、五个兄弟国家中，到处漾溢着对毛主席的热爱，这该是多么使人感动的事情！作为一个毛泽东时代的青年，作为一个党报的工作人员，我感到非常的骄傲与光荣。
    东欧兄弟国家中的工人农民们对于新中国与志愿军的热爱不是偶然的。这是因为我们有着共同的目标，为着共同的事业。这是我们亲密无间的友谊的根源。这种友谊是世界上最宝贵、最崇高的友谊，是国界、民族所不能阻隔，语言、风俗所不能影响的。从“家书报友情”这篇通讯中，我深深地体会到了这一点。
    这篇通讯告诉我们：我们应该更加热爱我们伟大的祖国，并为它贡献出我们的一切！
