Resolutely Implement the Marriage Law and Protect Women's Rights!
Cadres in Pukou Village, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, Interfere with the Freedom of Marriage of the Masses
Bad Element Yu Zhangquan Took the Opportunity to Force a Woman to Death
The Jinhua People's Court Imposed Too Light a Sentence on the Relevant Criminals and Should Re-examine the Case

The People's Court of Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, sentenced Yu Zhangquan and others in February of this year for interfering with the freedom of marriage and forcing Teng Guifen to death. The main offender, Yu Zhangquan, and others were punished according to the law.

Teng Guifen, a woman from Pukou Village, Jinhua County, has been in love with Yu Xianbang, the deputy secretary of the Youth League branch in the village, since last winter. The two had an excellent relationship and were preparing to inform their parents and get married. However, the village militia believed that Teng and Yu were suspected of "adultery" and had ambushed them several times to "catch them in the act," but failed.

On the evening of January 6th this year, Teng Guifen and Yu Xianbang went to Teng's house to talk after attending a work meeting of the Young Pioneers. The militia learned of this and, assuming that Yu Xianbang was at Teng Guifen's house, initiated by Lu Jiabao, the militia squad leader, gathered eight people including Yu Zhangquan, the acting deputy captain of the militia, and Yu Zhangqi, and ambushed them around Teng's house. At about 10 p.m., Yu Xianbang came out of Teng's house and was captured by Yu Zhangquan and taken to the militia headquarters. Yu Yaoming, the director of the Farmers' Association, immediately interrogated him and forced him to confess. Yu Xianbang admitted that he "went to Teng Guifen's house to discuss marriage" and was forced to write a "confession." Yu Yaoming then sent someone to call Teng Guifen and ordered her to confess. Guifen refused to confess. Afterwards, Shi Shiweng and Sun Youxue, cadres stationed in the village, and a cadre surnamed Chen who came to work in the village from another village, took Teng and Yu to the township office for a discussion. Chen comforted Yu Xianbang; Shi Shiweng and Sun Youxue believed that Guifen was "dishonest."

That night, Shi Shiweng called the Xiaoshun District Office to ask for their opinion on the incident. The next morning, Shi Shiweng told the village cadres: "We can no longer ask them (referring to Teng and Yu) to confess." Therefore, the village cadres and general militia and Youth League members were no longer preparing to have Teng and Yu confess. However, Yu Zhangquan, a Youth League member in the village, insisted on struggling against Teng and Yu. Yu Zhangquan said to Yu Jiabang, a member of the Farmers' Association: "If your Farmers' Association doesn't fight, the Youth League will; if the Youth League doesn't fight, I will fight personally!" He threatened them by saying, "Otherwise, the militia and the Youth League will be disbanded." There were political reasons why Yu Zhangquan wantonly carried out destructive activities. Yu Zhangquan's two elder brothers were officers in the Kuomintang reactionary army, and his father was a local pettifogger. Yu Zhangquan's family was very dissatisfied with the land reform that was taking place at the time, and Yu Zhangquan called the activists in the land reform movement "tigers." Teng and Yu were very active in the land reform. Yu Zhangquan attempted to use this to divert the masses' struggle goals in the land reform and incited Yu Xianheng, the acting captain of the militia, to jointly convene a Youth League and militia meeting and send people to find Yu and Teng to "confess." At about 9 o'clock, two militiamen called Yu Xianbang to a meeting. Not long after, Yu Haimei and Yu Genzhi, two female Youth League members, instigated by Yu Zhangquan, came to call Guifen to a meeting (i.e., to confess). Guifen refused to go, and the two forcibly dragged her away. When they reached the Sanyi intersection to the right of Guifen's house, Guifen broke free from their hands and said: "I'm not going, call Yu Xianbang!" After the two left, Teng Guifen crossed a small hill and went to the Guandi Temple, which was half a kilometer away from the village, and hanged herself on the wooden fence to the right of the Buddha's seat.

Seeing that they had not brought Teng Guifen, Yu Zhangquan took several militiamen to call her himself. But he could not find Teng Guifen. Therefore, Yu Zhangquan did not let Yu Xianbang confess alone, but only read the Youth League charter and set militia discipline. He insisted that Yu Xianbang and Teng Guifen's love was "in conflict with the League Charter's requirement that members be pure and violated discipline."

Guifen's mother learned that Guifen had not gone to the meeting, fearing an accident, searched everywhere at relatives' homes, and finally found Guifen's body in the Guandi Temple. Medical rescue was ineffective.

After the incident, the Jinhua County People's Court organized relevant agencies and groups to conduct three on-site investigations to fully clarify the facts. Based on the actual situation, the Jinhua County People's Court sentenced the main criminals involved in the case on February 12, 1951, as follows: The main offender, Yu Zhangquan, incited the masses, convened a meeting, forced people to confess, and forced a person to death, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and compensation for damages for five years, five dan of rice per year. (Teng Guifen was the main labor force in the Teng family. After Guifen's death, her family would face great difficulties, so the Jinhua County People's Court discretionarily ordered the main perpetrator of the case to compensate for damages. The same applies below.) Lu Jiabao falsely accused others of adultery and illegally arrested village cadres, was sentenced to three months of unrestricted freedom of labor and one-time compensation of five dan of rice. Yu Yaoming, Yu Zhangqi, and Yu Xianheng falsely accused others of adultery, forced others to confess, and publicly insulted them, each sentenced to two months of unrestricted freedom of labor. Yu Zhangquan falsely accused others of adultery, participated in the illegal arrest of village cadres, and was given criticism and education. In addition, Shi Shiweng and Sun Youxue had a vague understanding of the Marriage Law, causing undue losses to their work, and should conduct a public self-criticism at a mass meeting in Pukou Village.

Editor's note: The case of cadres and militiamen in Pukou Village, Jinhua County, interfering with the freedom of marriage and being exploited by the bad element Yu Zhangquan, who forced Teng Guifen to death, deserves attention in various places. The conspiracy of the bad element Yu Zhangquan in this case was vicious. The illegal actions of village cadres and militiamen interfering with the freedom of marriage gave Yu Zhangquan an opportunity to carry out destructive activities and caused serious consequences. We believe that the Jinhua County People's Court's sentences for certain criminals involved in this case are too lenient and should be re-examined.

### 坚决贯彻婚姻法，保障妇女权利！  浙江金华县浦口村干部干涉群众婚姻自由  坏分子俞章全乘机逼死妇女  金华人民法院对有关案犯判处太轻应重新处理

    坚决贯彻婚姻法，保障妇女权利！
    浙江金华县浦口村干部干涉群众婚姻自由
    坏分子俞章全乘机逼死妇女
    金华人民法院对有关案犯判处太轻应重新处理
    浙江省金华县人民法院于今年二月间判决俞章全等干涉婚姻自由、逼死滕桂芬一案。首犯俞章全等分别受到法律制裁。
    滕桂芬，女，金华县浦口村人。自去冬开始，即与本村青年团支部副书记俞宪邦恋爱；双方感情极好，已准备向父母说明后结婚。但该村民兵认为滕、俞二人有“通奸嫌疑”，曾数次埋伏“捉奸”未遂。
    今年一月六日晚，滕桂芬、俞宪邦二人于参加少年儿童队工作会议之后，至滕家谈天。民兵得知后，猜定俞宪邦在滕桂芬家，遂由民兵班长卢家宝发起，集合民兵代理副队长俞章权、俞章齐等八人，埋伏在滕家周围。约十时左右，俞宪邦由滕家走出，被俞章权捕获，押至民兵队部。当即由农会主任俞耀明进行讯问，并强令坦白。俞宪邦除承认“是去滕桂芬家约婚”以外，并被迫具下“坦白书”。俞耀明又派人将滕桂芬叫来，责令坦白。桂芬拒绝坦白。之后，住该村区干部施世文、孙友雪及外村来该村工作的干部陈某将滕、俞二人带至乡公所谈话。陈安慰了俞宪邦；施世文、孙友雪则认为桂芬
    “不老实”。
    当晚，施世文打电话请示孝顺区区公所对此事件的意见。第二天早晨，施世文告诉村干部：“不能再要他们（指滕、俞二人）坦白了。”因此该村干部及一般民兵、青年团员便不再准备要滕、俞二人坦白。但该村青年团员俞章全坚持斗争滕、俞二人。俞章全向农会委员俞家邦说：“你们农会不斗争，青年团里要斗；青年团里不斗；我个人也要斗！”并以“否则民兵、青年团都解散”相威胁。俞章全之所以肆意进行破坏活动，是有政治原因的。俞章全的两个哥哥在国民党反动军队中当军官，父亲是土讼师。俞章全的家庭对当时正在进行的土地改革很不满意，俞章全把土地改革运动中的积极分子称为“老虎”。滕、俞二人在土地改革中很积极。俞章全企图借此转移群众在土地改革中的斗争目标，煽惑民兵代理队长俞宪亨共同召集了青年团、民兵大会，并派人去找俞、滕二人前来“坦白”。约九点钟，两个民兵把俞宪邦叫去开会。不一会，女青年团员俞海妹、俞根芝二人受了俞章全的唆使，来叫桂芬开会（即去坦白）。桂芬不肯去，两人硬拉着她走。走到桂芬家的右边三义路口处，桂芬挣脱她们的手说：“我是不去了，你们叫俞宪邦来吧！”二人走后，滕桂芬越过小山坡，到离村一里路的关帝庙，在佛座右边木栅上吊死了。
    俞章全看她们没有把滕桂芬叫来，带了几个民兵自己去叫。但已找不到滕桂芬。因此，俞章全没有让俞宪邦单独坦白，只宣读了青年团团章，并订了民兵纪律。硬说俞宪邦、滕桂芬二人恋爱是“与团章上规定的团员要纯洁是冲突的，是违反纪律的”。
    桂芬母亲得知桂芬没去开会，怕出意外，到亲戚家遍找不见，后来在关帝庙发现了桂芬的尸体，经医生急救无效。
    事件发生后，金华县人民法院即组织有关机关团体进行了三次实地调查，将事实完全弄清。金华县人民法院根据实际情况，于一九五一年二月十二日对此案有关主要案犯判决如下：首犯俞章全鼓动群众，召开大会，迫人坦白，逼死人命，判处徒刑二年，赔偿损害五年，每年稻谷五担。（滕桂芬为滕家主要劳动力，桂芬死后，其家庭将遭遇很大困难，故金华县人民法院酌责本案首要分子赔偿损害。下同。）卢家宝诬害他人通奸，非法逮捕村干部，处不拘束自由劳役三个月，一次赔偿损害稻谷五担。俞耀明、俞章齐、俞宪亨诬蔑他人通奸，强迫他人坦白并进行公开侮辱，各处不拘束自由劳役二个月。俞章权诬蔑他人通奸，参加非法逮捕村干部，给以批评教育。此外，施世文、孙友雪对婚姻法认识模糊，使工作遭受到不应有的损失，应在浦口村群众大会上进行公开检讨。
    编者按：金华县浦口村干部、民兵等干涉婚姻自由，被坏分子俞章全钻了空子，逼死滕桂芬一案值得各地注意。坏分子俞章全在此案件中的阴谋是恶毒的。村干部、民兵干涉婚姻自由的非法行为，给了俞章全以进行破坏活动的机会，并且造成了严重恶果。我们认为：金华县人民法院对此案有关的某些罪犯的判决是过轻的，应重新加以处理。
