To the Editor:

    In Yongchun County, Fujian Province, incidents of women committing suicide due to involuntary marriages continue to occur. In the third district of the county, three women were forced to commit suicide because of poor relationships with their husbands and abuse by their parents-in-law. Chen Gang of Taodong Township in the fourth district of the county was betrothed by her parents. Later, she learned that the man was a loafer. She did not want to marry him, but her parents refused. She was also forced to commit suicide by jumping into a well. The reason why the feudal marriage system and illegal phenomena of abusing women still exist seriously in Yongchun County shows that the county's publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law are far from adequate. I suggest that the local authorities immediately take effective measures to vigorously publicize the Marriage Law and seriously handle incidents of harming women, and not allow these incidents to continue to occur.

    建议福建永春县人民政府认真处理虐杀妇女的事件编辑同志：
    福建省永春县妇女因婚姻不自由而自杀的事件不断发生。该县第三区就有三个妇女因夫妻感情不好，又受公婆虐待而被迫自杀。该县第四区桃东乡陈纲，因父母给她包办订婚，后知男方是个二流子，她不愿意结婚，父母不许，也被逼得跳井自杀了。封建婚姻制度和虐害妇女的违法现象在永春县之所以仍然严重地存在，说明了该县对婚姻法的宣传、执行是十分不够的。我建议当地有关机关应立即采取有效办法，大力宣传婚姻法，严肃处理残害妇女的事件，不要再让这些事件继续发生。
