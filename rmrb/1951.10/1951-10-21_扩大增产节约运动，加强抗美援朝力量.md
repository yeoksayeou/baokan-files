Expand the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, Strengthen the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea

    Using increased production and practicing economy to strengthen our country's economic construction and national defense, and to strengthen the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, is an important political task for the people of the whole country at present. The working class in Northeast China is setting a good example for the people of the whole country in this regard. The Northeast industrial increase production and practice economy plan has reached 10.04 million tons of grain. This glorious achievement is a major contribution of the Northeast working class to the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    The Northeast working class has been able to achieve such great results because they have actively exerted their creativity, made full use of the potential capacity of industry, increased output, improved quality, reduced costs, saved funds, and increased labor productivity. The No. 5 Electric Factory used to produce 300 motors per month, but by the end of the year it will be able to produce 1,100 more. The Fushun Chemical Plant used to have a maximum ash content of 29% in the coke produced by horizontal furnaces, and no one wanted to buy the product; now, due to improved quality, the number of orders from the outside world has exceeded one and a half times the current production capacity. The Shenyang Smelter can save 1,518 tons of grain just by reducing costs. The workers of the open hearth furnace team of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Factory have continuously improved their operating methods. The first increase production plan was for 34 tons of grain, and the third plan reached 3,205 tons of grain, an increase of 93 times over the original plan. Each worker in the open hearth furnace team will increase production and save an average of 128 tons of grain this year, which is equivalent to the annual production of 64 farmers.

    There is no doubt that the workers and people of the whole country should learn from the example of the Northeast working class in the increase production and practice economy campaign. It should be pointed out that the potential strength of our industry has not been fully utilized in many parts of the country, and many intolerable wasteful phenomena caused by poor management still exist seriously in many places. For example, the sodium sulfide produced by the Datong Chemical Plant in Chahar Province is of poor quality, and four-fifths of it cannot be sold. The Qinghai Wool Textile Factory has surplus working capital on the books that can be used to build 8.8 factories of the same scale as the factory. More seriously, the candy and biscuit factory under the Tianjin Industrial Bureau had as much as 60,000 jin of moldy biscuits when making military orders in July. If these wasteful phenomena are not stopped, they will cause serious difficulties to our country, weaken our country's construction strength, and bring disasters to the young industry.

    It should be pointed out that the current waste is serious and is manifested in all aspects. There are some people in our ranks who do not care about wasting tens of billions or hundreds of billions of yuan. For example, from May to September this year, incomplete statistics from northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hubei showed that 3.17 million jin of grain were damaged by insects, mold, theft, and spoilage due to poor storage. In Tianjin, due to the unreasonable distribution of warehouse use, seven professional companies have wasted 75 billion yuan in wharf rent and unloading costs.

    There are some people who show extraordinary generosity with the people's money. These people show waste in everything from commemorative albums to congratulatory banners, treating guests, watching operas, taking photos, visiting parks, and eating apples, regardless of what kind of meeting they hold. At first glance, these seem to be insignificant "small things", but if you calculate carefully, you will know that this is a huge waste. If there are more than 100,000 people in the country holding meetings every day, then the waste will not only be several million or tens of millions, but will be hundreds of millions, tens of billions, or even hundreds of billions. If this is the case every day, how much will be wasted in a month or a year?! Furthermore, many people usually waste water and electricity casually. If the waste from all over the country is added together, the result will be an astonishing number. In the final analysis, these wasteful phenomena all show an irresponsible attitude towards the people's property.

    The people have made arduous efforts to create huge wealth for the country, but waste is ruthlessly destroying and devouring our labor achievements. In order to strengthen the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and to strengthen the country's economic construction, learning from the great creation of the Northeast working class and launching a resolute struggle against waste has become an important part of the current patriotic movement.

### 扩大增产节约运动，加强抗美援朝力量

    扩大增产节约运动，加强抗美援朝力量
    用增产节约，来增强我们国家经济建设和国防建设的力量，来增强抗美援朝的力量，这是全国人民目前的一项重要政治任务。东北工人阶级在这方面正为全国人民树立了一个良好的榜样。东北工业增产节约计划已达一千零四十万吨粮食。这一光辉事迹，是东北工人阶级在伟大的抗美援朝运动中的重大贡献。
    东北工人阶级，所以能够取得这样伟大的成绩，这是由于他们积极发挥了创造性，充分利用了工业的潜在能力，是由于他们增加了产量，提高了质量，降低了成本，节约了资金，提高了劳动生产率。电工五厂过去每月能产三百台电机，现在到年底能再多产一千一百台电机。抚顺化工厂过去水平炉出的焦炭含灰量最高达百分之二十九，产品无人问津；现在由于改进了质量，外界订货数字已超过现在生产能力一倍半。沈阳冶炼厂仅降低成本一项，即可节约一千五百一十八吨粮食。沈阳第二机器厂平炉班工人不断改进操作方法，第一次订的增产计划是三十四吨粮食，第三次订的计划达到三千二百零五吨粮食，比原计划增加了九十三倍。平炉班每个工人今年平均增产节约一百二十八吨粮食，即等于六十四个农民的全年生产量。
    毫无疑问，全国工人和全国人民都应当学习东北工人阶级在增产节约运动中的榜样。应该指出：我们工业的潜在力量在全国许多地方还没有得到应有的发挥，由于管理不善所产生的许多令人难以容忍的浪费现象，还在很多地方严重地存在着。如察哈尔省大同化学厂生产的硫化碱，产品质量低劣，五分之四无法卖出。青海省的毛纺织厂，仅从账面上发现的该厂富余的流动资金，即可同时用于相当该厂规模的八点八个工厂。更严重的是像天津工业局所属的糖果饼干工厂，在七月份做军需订货时，霉坏饼干达六万斤之多。这些浪费现象如不停止，就会给我们的国家增加严重的困难，削弱我们国家建设的力量，并将给年青的工业带来奇灾大祸。
    应该指出：目前的浪费是严重的，是表现在各个方面的。我们的队伍里有一种人，他们对于浪费几十亿元或者几百亿元，表示毫不在乎。如今年五月至九月，川北、川东、贵州、湖北四地不完全的统计，因保管不善而被虫咬、霉变、盗卖损耗粮食达三百十七万斤。天津因为仓库使用分配不合理，七个专业公司因栈租、卸运的浪费已达七百五十亿元。
    有一种人，用人民群众的钱表现了出奇的慷慨。这些人不论开什么会议，从纪念册到贺幛、请客、看戏、照相、游园、吃苹果，无一不表现了浪费。这骤然看来，像是不足挂齿的“小事情”，但如果仔细计算一下，就会知道这是一笔巨大的浪费。全国每天假若有十余万人在开会，那么所浪费的就会不只是几百万几千万，而会是几万万，几十万万，甚至上百万万。如果每天都是这样，一个月一年会浪费多少呢？！再如，有很多人平时对用水用电是随便浪费的，如果把全国各地的这种浪费加在一起，就会得出一个惊人的数字。归根到底，这些浪费现象都表现了对人民财产不负责任的态度。
    人民经过了艰苦的努力，才为国家创造出巨大财富，但浪费却在无情地破坏和吞噬我们的劳动成果。为了加强抗美援朝的力量，为了加强国家经济建设的力量，学习东北工人阶级的伟大创造，和浪费现象展开坚决的斗争，已经成为目前爱国运动的一项重要的内容了。（附图片）
