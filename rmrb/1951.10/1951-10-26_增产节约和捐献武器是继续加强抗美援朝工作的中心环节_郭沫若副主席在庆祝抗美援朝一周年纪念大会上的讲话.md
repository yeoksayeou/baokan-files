    Today is the first anniversary of the patriotic movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Country. I now represent the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in expressing warm congratulations at this meeting. I pay tribute to the heroic Korean People's Army and General Kim Il-sung! I pay tribute to General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and all commanders, combatants, political workers, logistics personnel, and transportation personnel! I pay tribute to all comrades wounded in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea! I extend sincere condolences to the families of revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary martyrs throughout the country!
    The just war of the Chinese and Korean people against American aggression has achieved great victory. From October 25th of last year to October 10th of this year, we have inflicted casualties of over 387,000 on the enemy, of which over 176,000 are American troops. In the first year of the Pacific War, the total number of American casualties was 58,000. Today's 176,000 is more than three times that number. In addition, we have shot down, damaged, and captured 2,310 enemy aircraft and seized countless enemy weapons.
    We have long driven the invading enemy troops from the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, shattered the enemy's arrogant plot to annex Korea and then invade our country, safeguarded the sacred defense of our motherland, promoted the peaceful construction of our motherland, and thus strengthened the firm belief of the people of Asia and the world in opposing aggression and defending peace.
    The victory of the Chinese and Korean people is a common victory for all peace-loving people in Asia and the world. All peace-loving people in Asia and the world are rejoicing and encouraged by this common great victory. Our great victory proves that the power of the people is inviolable and that imperialist aggression can be defeated.
    The American imperialist "paper tiger," which appears strong but is weak, has been completely exposed by the Chinese and Korean people in the Korean War.
    However, American imperialism has still not learned its lesson today. Although it has been forced to accept the Korean armistice negotiations, it is using various means to delay, obstruct, and even sabotage the negotiations. It still occupies our Taiwan, continues its blockade of our country and other hostile actions, and blatantly colludes with the remnants of Japanese imperialism. On September 8th, it concluded a unilateral "peace treaty" with Japan, deliberately hostile to China and the Soviet Union and hostile to the people of Asia. At the same time, it also concluded the so-called "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," which turns Japanese reactionary forces into accomplices of American aggression. These actions, combined with its frantic increase in military spending, show that it is actively preparing to expand its aggression.
    We Chinese people love peace. Our movement to Resist America and Aid Korea is mainly aimed at striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, safeguarding the security of our motherland, and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. In order to achieve this sacred goal, we must concentrate our strength and continue to strengthen our struggle against aggression until the aggressors accept the lessons they should accept.
    Today, as we celebrate the first anniversary of the victory in Resisting America and Aiding Korea, the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is being held. Chairman Mao gave clear instructions in his opening speech: we "need to continue to strengthen the work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and need to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This is the central task of the Chinese people today." Yesterday, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the China Peace Committee gave a "Report on the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Country" at the meeting, which has been unanimously approved. The Third Session of the National Committee has also unanimously adopted seven resolutions, which I should convey to today's meeting. They are:
    (1) To continue to mobilize our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the Korean front;
    (2) To continue to develop and deepen patriotic education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea;
    (3) To thoroughly eliminate all special agents and spies of American imperialism and all acts of aggression in China;
    (4) To launch a large-scale patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy, and strengthen the strength of Resisting America and Aiding Korea and national construction;
    (5) To complete and continue to expand the movement to donate weapons;
    (6) To strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and the families of martyrs;
    (7) To popularize and deepen the patriotic pact movement.
    Increasing production and practicing economy and donating weapons should be the central links to continue strengthening the work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea.
    The state-owned enterprises and local industries in Northeast China are promoting the movement to increase production and practice economy on a large scale. From May of this year to the end of the year, due to increased production and savings, the value of state wealth can be increased by ten million tons of grain, which can be used to purchase more than four thousand jet fighters.
    The Chuanbei Administrative Office is a relatively remote and poor area with a population of 15.5 million. It has pledged to donate 29 airplanes, 2 cannons, and 2 anti-aircraft guns. It has already paid 53.9 billion yuan during the National Day holiday. Not only has it completed the task ahead of schedule, but it has also overfulfilled it, exceeding it by 7 billion yuan.
    Comrades, let us learn from Northeast China! Let us learn from Chuanbei! In order to strengthen the strength of Resisting America and Aiding Korea and national construction, let us launch a large-scale patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy, complete the task of the movement to donate weapons, and continue to expand it.
    Comrades, the seven resolutions of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of Chairman Mao represent the great will of the Chinese people. On the first anniversary of the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, we must resolutely, unitedly, and unreservedly support these seven resolutions and ensure that these seven resolutions are fully, thoroughly, and quickly implemented.
    Long live the united struggle of the Chinese and Korean people!
    Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed in the Korean War!
    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    增产节约和捐献武器是继续加强抗美援朝工作的中心环节
    ——郭沫若副主席在庆祝抗美援朝一周年纪念大会上的讲话
    今天是抗美援朝保家卫国爱国运动的一周年，我现在代表中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会在大会上表示热诚的庆祝。向英勇的朝鲜人民军和金日成将军致敬！向中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军及全体指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员、运输工作人员致敬！向为抗美援朝而负伤的全体同志致敬！向全国革命军人家属与革命烈士家属致诚恳的慰问！
    中朝人民共同反对美国侵略的正义战争是获得了伟大的胜利的。从去年十月二十五日到今年十月十日，我们已经使敌人伤亡了三十八万七千多人，其中美国军队的伤亡人数在十七万六千人以上。在太平洋战争的第一年，美军的伤亡总数是五万八千人，今天的十七万六千多人是足足达到三倍以上了。此外更击落、击伤、俘获了敌军飞机二千三百一十架，缴获了敌人的各种武器无算。
    我们已经早把敌人的侵略军队从鸭绿江边赶回到三八线附近，粉碎了敌人吞并朝鲜并进而侵略我国的狂妄阴谋，保障了祖国的神圣国防，促进了祖国的和平建设，因而加强了亚洲人民和全世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平的必胜信念。
    中朝人民的胜利是全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民的共同胜利。全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民都在为这共同的伟大胜利欢欣鼓舞。我们的伟大胜利证明了人民的力量是不可侵侮的，帝国主义的侵略是可以战胜的。
    美帝国主义这只外强中干的“纸老虎”，在侵朝战争中，是被我们中朝人民完全戳穿了。
    但是，美帝国主义在今天依然没有接受到失败的教训。它虽然被迫接受了朝鲜的停战谈判，但它使用种种手段拖延、阻挠、甚至破坏谈判的进行。它依然占领着我们的台湾，继续着对我国的封锁和其它种种敌对行动，而且明目张胆地和日本帝国主义的残余分子相勾结，在九月八日已经缔结了存心与中苏两国为敌、与亚洲人民为敌的片面对日“和约”，同时更缔结了使日本反动势力变为美国侵略的帮凶的所谓“美日安全条约”。这些行动和它的疯狂地增加军费相结合，表明它正在积极从事扩大侵略的准备。
    我们中国人民是爱好和平的。我们的抗美援朝运动，主要的目的也就在争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，保卫祖国的安全，保卫亚洲与世界和平。为了达到这个神圣的目的，我们必须集中我们的力量，继续加强我们的反抗侵略的斗争，直到侵略者接受它应该接受的教训为止。
    今天我们庆祝抗美援朝胜利的一周年，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议适逢其会，正在开会。毛主席在开会词中有了明确的指示：我们“需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务”。昨天抗美援朝总会副主席彭真同志在会议上作了“关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告”，已经获得了一致的同意。全国委员会第三次会议更一致通过了七项决议，我应该向今天的大会上传达。就是：
    （一）继续动员我们的人力、物力和财力，支援朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军；
    （二）继续发展和深入抗美援朝的爱国主义教育；
    （三）彻底肃清美帝国主义在中国的一切特务间谍分子和一切侵略活动；
    （四）大规模地开展爱国增产节约运动，加强抗美援朝和国家建设的力量；
    （五）完成和继续扩大捐献武器运动；
    （六）加强优待军人家属、烈士家属的工作；
    （七）普及和深入爱国公约运动。
    增产节约和捐献武器，应该是继续加强抗美援朝工作的中心环节。
    东北的国营企业和地方工业推行增产节约运动的规模很大。从本年五月起至年底，由于增产与节约，可以增加国家财富一千万吨粮食的价值，可以购买四千多架喷气式战斗机。
    川北行署区是比较偏僻贫苦的地方，人口一千五百五十万，认捐飞机二十九架、大炮二门、高射炮二门。在国庆节日已经缴纳五百三十九亿元。不仅提前完成了任务，而且超额完成了，超过七十亿元。
    同志们，我们向东北看齐吧！我们向川北看齐吧！为了加强抗美援朝和国家建设的力量，大规模地把爱国增产节约运动开展起来，把捐献武器运动的任务完成，而且继续扩大。
    同志们，在毛主席领导下的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的七项决议，代表了中国人民的伟大意志。在庆祝抗美援朝运动一周年的今天，我们一定要坚决地、一致地、毫无保留地拥护这七项决议，使这七项决议得到全面的、彻底的、迅速的实现。
    中朝人民团结斗争万岁！
    在朝鲜战争中牺牲了的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
