    Soviet Statement Exposes the Ugly Face of U.S. Imperialism
    To the Editor:
    We wholeheartedly support the Soviet government's solemn statement regarding the Korean situation and Soviet-U.S. relations. The Soviet government's statement has once again powerfully exposed the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to distort the facts and deceive the good people of the world in order to cover up their aggressive acts.
    Everyone knows that the United States launched the Korean War of aggression; the United States also violated the agreement and sabotaged the Korean armistice negotiations; U.S. aircraft strafed and bombed the Kaesong Neutral Zone on numerous occasions; and U.S. personnel also shot and killed our military police in the Neutral Zone. Can these ironclad facts not prove that it is U.S. imperialism that is creating the current tense situation in Korea? We want to warn the U.S. imperialists: no lies can deceive peace-loving people, and no threats can intimidate the Chinese people who have already stood up. The great Chinese people love peace, but they also have enough strength to defeat any aggressor's conspiracy. The strong and invincible friendship alliance between China and the Soviet Union is the guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world.

    苏联的声明揭露了美帝国主义的丑相编辑同志：
    我们全力拥护苏联政府关于朝鲜局势与苏美关系的严正声明。苏联政府的声明又一次有力地揭穿了美帝国主义者企图歪曲事实欺骗全世界善良的人们，以掩盖它的侵略行为的阴谋。
    人们都知道：发动朝鲜侵略战争的是美国；不遵守协议破坏朝鲜停战谈判的也是美国；历次扫射轰炸开城中立区的是美国飞机；枪杀中立区我方军事警察的又是美方人员。这些铁的事实，难道还不能够证明造成目前朝鲜紧张局势的正是美帝国主义吗？我们要警告美帝国主义者：任何谎言欺骗不了爱好和平的人民，任何威胁吓不倒已经站起来了的中国人民。伟大的中国人民热爱和平，但也有足够的力量来打败任何侵略者的阴谋。中苏两国强大无敌的友好同盟，就是远东与世界和平的保证。
