To the Editor of the People's Daily: Reactions to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions

    Regarding the illegal employment of technicians He Yifeng, Wang Molin, Yan Kezhi, etc. from Anshan Engineering and Civil Engineering Companies by the Tianjin Private Longshun Construction Factory, as published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 8th, our bureau now reports the handling of this matter as follows:
    After the Central Labor Department forwarded this issue and introduced representatives from Anshan Engineering and Civil Engineering Companies to contact us, we immediately contacted the Public Security Bureau's local police station and the trade union. We learned that there were no household registration or trade union transfer certificates for He Yifeng, etc. Therefore, we notified the manager of Longshun Construction Factory to discuss the matter at the police station. Manager Gu of the factory avoided meeting and only sent another person to accompany He Yifeng to the police station. We immediately explained the policy and mobilized He Yifeng to return to his original workplace. He resolutely refused. The person who accompanied him stated that he was recuperating in the Longshun factory and was not clear about the situation. Therefore, this conversation was fruitless. The next day, He sent a written statement, raising many objections to Anshan Engineering Company. Subsequently, He Yifeng sent another letter saying that he wanted to leave Longshun Factory and go far away to find another job, and guaranteed that similar incidents of leaving the factory without permission would never happen again. Based on the above situation, we transferred this case to the court for handling. During the court's investigation, it was proven that Longshun Factory had registered the names of the above-mentioned technicians in the "Staff Registration Form" of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau on June 8th. Anshan Engineering and Civil Engineering Companies also found witnesses who could prove that Longshun Factory had remitted money to Wang Molin and Yan Kezhi. At this point, the capitalist of Longshun Factory realized his mistake, published an apology in the newspaper, compensated the two representatives from the Northeast companies for their living expenses in Tianjin several times, totaling four million yuan, took responsibility for mobilizing He Yifeng and the other eight people to return to their original positions, and guaranteed that they would no longer illegally recruit on-the-job personnel. Because Longshun Factory requested the court to withdraw the original case, it was withdrawn on September 14th after all parties agreed.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    处理天津市私营隆顺营造厂
    违法乱拉在职技术人员事件编辑同志：
    八月八日人民日报“读者来信专页”栏内登载了天津市私营隆顺营造厂违法雇用鞍山工程、土建两公司技术员何一峰、王墨林、阎克志等的事情。现在，我局将关于此问题的处理经过报告于后：
    经中央劳动部转来此项问题，又介绍鞍山工程、土建两公司代表与我们联系后，我们当即与公安局派出所及工会联系，得悉并无何一峰等户口及工会转移证明，于是通知隆顺营造厂经理到派出所一谈。该厂谷经理避不见面，仅派另外一人陪同何一峰来派出所。我们当即讲明政策，动员何一峰回厂。何坚决不回去。陪同来的人则表示自己在隆顺厂内养病，情况不清楚。因此，这次谈话毫无结果。第二天，何送来书面材料，对鞍山工程公司提出很多意见；随后，何一峰又寄来一信说，自己要离开隆顺厂，远去他方，另找工作，并保证今后决不发生类似跳厂事件。我们根据以上情况，将此案移送法院处理。在法院调查过程中，证明隆顺厂曾于六月八日在天津市人民政府建设局的“工作人员登记表”里，登记了上述技术员的名字；鞍山工程、土建两公司也找到隆顺厂给王墨林、阎克志汇款的证明人。至此，隆顺厂资方始认识错误，登报悔过，赔偿东北两公司代表数次来天津之生活开支四百万元，负责动员何一峰等八人回原岗位，保证不再乱拉在职人员。由于隆顺厂要求将原案由法院撤回，经各方同意后，已于九月十四日撤回原案。
