    Our Hearts Leap with Excitement Along with Yours
    ——A Letter from Writer Lao She to Volunteer Army Commanders and Fighters
    Dear People's Volunteer Army Comrades:
    Dear comrades, please accept my sincere greetings and high respect!
    I am a literary worker. Although I would very much like to take this opportunity to talk about how the domestic compatriots, regardless of men, women, old or young, are thinking day and night about resisting America and aiding Korea, and therefore are constantly remembering your merits and hard work in Korea; although I also know that you are willing to hear about everything happening at home, just as we eagerly await to hear all your news about you; but please forgive me, I cannot write a comprehensive letter in such a short time. For the sake of being intimate and truthful, let me just talk about the situation in the literary and art circles.
    It is you, dear comrades, who have given a great inspiration to literary and art workers throughout the country. Indeed, using literature and art to promote resistance against America and aid Korea, and to praise the heroic and invincible Volunteer Army, has become a widespread movement, a new literary and artistic trend.
    I live in Beijing, so let me take Beijing as an example: Not to mention those who can draw comic strips, and the oil painting and watercolor artists, who enthusiastically use images to publicize your deeds of loving the motherland and defending peace, even those elderly painters have organized charity sales of calligraphy and paintings to resist America and aid Korea. Qi Baishi, an old man of ninety-one years old, Mr. Wang Aishi, eighty-one years old, Mr. Chen Banding, seventy-seven years old, and other old artists in their sixties and seventies, are all rushing to produce works day and night, taking them to charity sales, and donating all the proceeds to planes and artillery.
    Friends in the quyi (folk art) circles have been proud to perform the deeds of the Volunteer Army heroes since the start of the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Some performers have participated in the work of comforting the People's Volunteer Army in Korea, and after returning home, they went to various parts of the country to publicize. Even the blind artists in Beijing are not willing to lag behind. Not only have they learned the songs of resisting America and aiding Korea, but they have also organized working teams to go to the people to publicize; their lives are quite hard, but they have also donated some money. You, dear comrades, have made those with and without eyes see the concrete facts of patriotism, and stimulated everyone's patriotic heart.
    Beijing opera and local opera artists are also vying to organize charity performances and donations. Mr. Shang Heyu, an eighty-year-old man, went on stage despite his illness, and Mr. Ma Decheng, seventy-three years old, shaved off his beloved beard for the charity performance. Mr. Hao Shouchun, sixty-four years old, also shaved his beard for the charity performance and performs his famous plays once a month. You, dear comrades, have restored the youth of the elderly artists.
    I participated in the review work of the Beijing municipal workers and students' literary and art competition. The paintings, songs, dances, performances, and creations of the workers and students are all centered on resisting America and aiding Korea. You, dear comrades, are in the hearts of every literary and art worker in Beijing. Art is meant to move people, but you have moved the literary and art workers first. Your heroic actions of patriotism and internationalism are the source of our creation. By describing your merits and hard work, our literary and artistic works will be more substantial and more glorious.
    Dear comrades, the ears of our literary and art workers are listening to your voices, our eyes are watching your actions, and our hearts are leaping with excitement along with yours. Your bravery and greatness have created a new history. We hope that our creations, with your heroic actions as content, can gradually have greater momentum and more fervent emotions, so as to properly portray the heroes and make their deeds immortal!
    Dear comrades, I wish you health and victory! And pay my respects! Lao She
    October, 1951, Beijing

### 我们的心随着你们的心兴奋地激跳——作家老舍给志愿军指挥员战斗员的一封信

    我们的心随着你们的心兴奋地激跳
    ——作家老舍给志愿军指挥员战斗员的一封信亲爱的人民志愿军同志们：
    亲爱的同志们，首先请接受我的真诚的慰问与崇高的敬礼！
    我是个文艺工作者。虽然我很愿意，乘这个机会，说说国内的同胞，不分男女老幼，是怎样的昼夜不忘抗美援朝，因此也就时刻不忘你们在朝鲜的功劳与辛苦；虽然我也知道，你们愿意听到国内的一切情形，正像我们那么切盼听到你们的一切消息；可是，请原谅我吧，我没法子在短短的时间内写成一封包罗万象的信。为了亲切真实，我只说些文艺界的情形吧。
    是你们，亲爱的同志们，给了全国文艺工作者一个伟大的灵感。真的，以文艺宣传抗美援朝，歌颂志愿军的英勇无敌，已经成为普遍的运动，一个新的文艺思潮。
    我住在北京，就以北京来说吧：不要说那些位会画连环图画的，和油画、水彩的艺术家们，热心的用图象宣传你们的热爱祖国保卫和平的事迹，就是那些位年老的画家们也组织了抗美援朝书画义卖。九十一岁的齐白石老人，八十一岁的汪蔼士先生，七十七岁的陈半丁先生，和其他的六七十岁的老艺术家们，都昼夜地赶制作品，拿去义卖，以全部收入捐献飞机大炮。
    曲艺界的朋友们，自抗美援朝以来，就以表演志愿军英雄们的事迹为荣。一部分艺人曾参加了慰问在朝鲜的人民志愿军的工作，归国后，又到全国各地去作宣传。连北京的盲艺人也不甘落后，他们不单学会了抗美援朝的歌曲，并且组织了工作队去到民间作宣传；他们的生活都相当的苦，可是也还捐献出一些钱来。你们，亲爱的同志们，使有眼与没眼的一样的看到了爱国主义的具体事实，激发了大家的爱国心。
    京剧与地方戏的艺人们也争先恐后地组织义演献捐。八十岁的尚和玉老先生抱病登台，七十三岁的马德成老先生因义演而剃去心爱的胡须。六十四岁的郝寿臣先生为了义演也剃去胡子，每月一次表演他的拿手好戏。你们，亲爱的同志们，使年迈的艺人恢复了青春。
    我参加过北京市工人学生的文艺竞赛的评阅工作。工人们学生们所画的，唱的，舞的，表演的，创作的，一致的以抗美援朝为中心。你们，亲爱的同志们，是在北京的每一个文艺工作者的心中。文艺是要感动人的，你们却先感动了文艺工作者。你们的爱国主义与国际主义的英雄行动是我们创作的泉源，通过描写你们的功劳与辛苦，我们的文艺作品会更充实，更多光彩。
    亲爱的同志们，我们文艺工作者的耳是听着你们的声音，眼是看着你们的行动，我们的心也随着你们的心兴奋的激跳。你们的英勇，伟大，创造了新的历史。我们希望：我们的创作，既以你们的英雄行动为内容，也逐渐的能有更大的气魄，更热烈的感情，好恰当地把英雄们描画出来，使英雄们的事迹永垂不朽！
    亲爱的同志们，敬祝你们健康与胜利！并致敬礼！  老舍
    一九五一、十北京
