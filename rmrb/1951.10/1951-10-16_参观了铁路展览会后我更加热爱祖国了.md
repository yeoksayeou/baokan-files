    After Visiting the Railway Exhibition, I Love My Motherland Even More
    To the Editor:
    I recently visited the National Railway Exhibition at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. Through this exhibition, I not only witnessed the leap-forward development of our motherland's railway industry, but also recalled past events, which deepened my hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries. On December 8, 1945, I walked from Shandong to Beijing. At that time, the Kuomintang was beginning to "take over" in various places, and the atmosphere was filled with chaos. The railway was impassable. On the road, in addition to being intimidated and interrogated by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, we were also looted near the Yellow River cliffs, and all our meager travel expenses and clothes were taken away. Under such a terrifying situation, we walked for a full sixteen days to reach Beijing. However, today is completely different. The people can not only take direct trains, but also they are not delayed, and can arrive at the station on time every time, not to mention the safety along the way. These achievements and happiness are what our people have obtained through countless bloody struggles under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, we must cherish every victory and consolidate every victory. In order to achieve this goal, we should step up the resistance against America and aid Korea, and do everything in our power to defend our sacred motherland.

### 参观了铁路展览会后我更加热爱祖国了

    参观了铁路展览会后我更加热爱祖国了编辑同志：
    最近我去北京劳动人民文化宫参观了一次全国铁路展览会。通过这个展览会，一方面使我看到了祖国铁路事业的飞跃发展；另一方面使我回忆起往事，更加深了对国民党反动派的愤恨。一九四五年十二月八日，我由山东徒步到北京，当时正是国民党在各地开始“接收”，到处乌烟瘴气，铁路不能通行。我们在路上除了受尽蒋匪军的恫吓和盘查外，并在黄河崖附近遭到他们的掠夺，将我们仅有的少数旅费、衣服全部抢去。在这种无时无地不恐怖的情况下，我们整整走了十六天才到达北京。但是，今天已完全不同了，人民非但可以坐着直达的火车，而且不误班，每次都能准时到站，更别提什么沿路的安全问题了。这些成就和幸福是我们人民在共产党领导下经过无数次的流血斗争才得到的。因此，我们必须珍惜每一个胜利的果实，巩固每一个胜利的果实。为了达到这个目的，我们应该加紧抗美援朝，尽一切的力量保卫自己神圣的祖国。
