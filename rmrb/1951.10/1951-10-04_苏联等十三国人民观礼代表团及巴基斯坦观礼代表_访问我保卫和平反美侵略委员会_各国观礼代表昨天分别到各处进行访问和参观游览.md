Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The delegations from thirteen countries, including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, Vietnam, India, Burma, and Indonesia, and Ibrahim Jelisse, the representative from Pakistan, who were invited to participate in our National Day celebrations, visited the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression on the morning of the 3rd. The guests were received by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Secretary-General Liu Guanyi, and heads of various departments. Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Deng Yingchao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Sha Kefu, Secretary of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, were present as well.

Chairman Guo Moruo gave a report on the Chinese people's movement to defend peace, saying: The Chinese people love peace. The Chinese people deeply know that to defend peace, we must oppose aggressors and wars of aggression. The Chinese people also deeply know that to defend world peace, we must unite with the people of the world. Guo Moruo reported in detail on the Chinese people's movement to defend peace and the widely launched movement to resist America and aid Korea. He pointed out: In the past year of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, people have clearly seen that American imperialism is not at all terrible. After a year of struggle, American imperialism was forced to accept peace talks, but its policy of aggression has not changed. To defend peace, we must make even greater efforts. Guo Moruo concluded by saying: Unity is strength. The entire Chinese people have united to defend the motherland and world peace. The Chinese people are willing to unite with the people of Asia to defend Asian peace, and are willing to unite with the people of the world to defend world peace. May all of us peace-loving warriors unite to defend lasting world peace. Guo Moruo's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause, and at the end of his speech, everyone stood up and applauded warmly.

Obalin, a member of the Soviet People's Observation Delegation, a member of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee, and a member of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech in which he congratulated the Chinese people on the great and decisive victory they had won in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and wished the Chinese people greater victories in the lofty cause of defending world peace. Obalin said: The struggle to defend peace has become a cause intimately connected to the flesh and blood of hundreds of millions of working people in various countries and continents. The people of the world are using various methods and in various corners to carry out the struggle for peace. The great Chinese people are closely integrating their struggle for peace with the struggle against American imperialism. The great victory of our socialist motherland in the cause of building communism and its tireless struggle for world peace are inspiring millions of people with confidence in the inevitable victory of the cause of peace. The unbreakable friendship between the powerful Soviet Union and the 500 million Chinese people led by the great leader Mao Zedong is inspiring this belief. The fact that the great standard-bearer of peace, Stalin, is leading these peace fighters is inspiring all nationalities with confidence in the inevitable victory of the cause of peace.

Sendral, head of the Indian Goodwill Mission to China and member of the All-India Peace Council, said: Every Indian knows that the Soviet Union advocates peace, and every Indian also knows that China advocates peace. Today, I assure you that India also advocates peace. Sendral then paid tribute to the great advocates of peace, Stalin and Mao Zedong. All those present applauded warmly.

Sendral continued: "In the past few days, we have seen the great victories and achievements of your country in Beijing, and we have been deeply moved. In addition to its achievements on the battlefield, China is also an example for many countries in terms of construction and revitalization. I assure our brothers and sisters in Vietnam, Burma and Germany that the people of India stand with them. We need a free and united Vietnam, a free and united Burma and a free and united Germany. We Indians want to see a free and united Korea. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Stalin and Mao Zedong, we will achieve the unity of all the peoples of the world."

Sendral continued: "We did not participate in the San Francisco Conference. I assure you that we will never participate in such a conspiracy. In the peace movement, we are working to promote the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. We are promoting and will continue to promote this movement until these goals are achieved. Like you, I hope to see all the weapons in the world crushed to pieces."

Sendral concluded: "I know that as long as imperialism exists in the world, the people of the Soviet Union and China will continue to fight for peace. As long as imperialism exists, India will fight alongside the Soviet Union and China for peace."

When Zheng Shengyan, a member of the Korean People's Observation Delegation and a standing member of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, stood up to speak, he was greeted with prolonged applause. First, on behalf of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace and all the Korean people, he paid warm tribute to the great Chinese people and their leader Chairman Mao, who organized the Volunteer Army to assist the Korean people in resisting American aggressors. Zheng Shengyan said: The Korean people have never invaded other countries, but when they are invaded, they must take up arms to resolutely resist. The Korean people have not been intimidated in the slightest by the brutal crimes of American imperialism in Korea, and they are fighting more resolutely and vigorously. The Korean people are fully confident of winning final victory and achieving lasting world peace.

Anna Seghers, a member of the People's Observation Delegation from the German Democratic Republic and a representative of the German Peace Committee, said in her speech that she thanked the Chinese peace fighters for setting a great example of fighting for peace for them. She said: "Just as China is firmly fighting for peace in the East, Germany is also firmly fighting for peace in the West. We assure the Soviet Union, China and all peace fighters: the German people will fight for peace until the imperialist warmongers are eliminated and lasting world peace is achieved."

Deqin Gudumai, head of the Burmese People's Observation Delegation, said in his speech: Burma is launching a signature campaign for the Peace Declaration to ban atomic weapons and the declaration to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. This shows that the Burmese people are also actively participating in defending world peace. We are very happy to cooperate with the peace-loving Chinese people and the people of the world to defend peace. I wish the world peace movement victory.

Tabrani, head of the Indonesian People's Observation Delegation, said: I congratulate the Chinese people on their great achievements in the struggle for peace. These great achievements will promote the world peace movement. The Indonesian people love peace and oppose all aggression. We oppose Western imperialism, especially Dutch imperialism. He concluded by shouting: Long live the world peace movement! Long live the People's Republic of China under the leadership of Chairman Mao!

Chairman Guo Moruo finally stood up and gave a speech, thanking the representatives of various countries for their enthusiastic speeches. He said: This gathering has become a small-scale peace conference. Although our languages are different, our common language is "peace." The resolution of the Warsaw World Peace Congress stated: We must never wait for peace, we must strive for peace. We firmly believe that peace will surely defeat wars of aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The representatives of various countries who were invited to participate in our National Day celebrations visited and toured various places this afternoon. Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg and Chilean poet Pablo Neruda visited He Xiangning today and toured her studio. The Soviet People's Observation Delegation toured the city and Beihai Park. The Bulgarian and Czechoslovak People's Observation Delegations toured Beihai Park. István Rusznyák, a member of the Hungarian People's Observation Delegation and President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, visited the Chinese Academy of Sciences and gave a report on the organization and work of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Some representatives of the Korean People's Observation Delegation visited the wounded and sick of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the morning and toured the Summer Palace in the afternoon.
