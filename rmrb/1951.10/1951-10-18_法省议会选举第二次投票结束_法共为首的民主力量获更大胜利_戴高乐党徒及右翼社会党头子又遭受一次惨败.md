　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 17th: The second round of the French provincial council elections was held on October 14th. The results show that the French democratic forces, led by the Communist Party, not only consolidated the victory they achieved in the first round of voting on October 7th, but also expanded this victory; while the French reactionary forces suffered yet another defeat.

　　In the 702 electoral districts in mainland France that required a second round of voting, the Communist Party received far more votes than all other reactionary parties: it received 1,062,000 votes, accounting for 27.54 percent of the total votes, compared to 23.8 percent in the first round; the Socialist Party, in second place, received only 698,000 votes, accounting for 18.1 percent of the total votes; and the fascist leader De Gaulle's Rally of the French People (RPF) received only 612,000 votes, accounting for 15.8 percent of the total votes.

　　Since the October 7th election showed that the French Communist Party had the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, the French reactionaries, from the bosses of the right-wing Socialist Party to De Gaulle's followers, frantically colluded to attack the Communist Party out of fear. The RPF publicly announced that it would "support any candidate who has a chance of defeating its enemy, the Communist Party." Thus, the notorious so-called "Third" and "Fourth" forces parties such as the right-wing Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, the Independent Republican Peasant Union, and the "Left-Wing Union" not only formed groups among themselves, but also blatantly joined forces with the RPF to support common candidates, thereby concentrating votes and creating a majority. However, despite all this, the Communist Party still won 42 seats, bringing the total to 78 seats combined with the seats won on the 7th, 41 more seats than in the 1948 provincial council elections. At the same time, because the French people deeply abhor fascism, many reactionary parties, especially local organizations of the Socialist Party, disregarded the orders of their upper-level leadership and resolutely refused to form an alliance with the De Gaulle elements, but accepted the minimum program put forward by the Communist Party after the first round of voting to defend peace, democracy, national independence, and the living rights of the working people, becoming allies of the Communist Party and winning 18 seats for themselves. *Pravda's* Paris correspondent Zhukov pointed out that this fact powerfully demonstrates that the broad masses of the French people have taken a step towards the road of a united national front.

　　The French Communist Party's organ, *L'Humanité*, commented on the election results on the 15th, saying: "First, it exposed the collusion between the Socialist Party leaders and De Gaulle, and also exposed the true faces of those who rely on the Socialist Party and the De Gaulle party. Second, it once again proved the hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy, which is only a democracy for the rich. In the election, the French Communist Party received the most votes, but won the fewest seats. Third, it proves that the unity of the French people around the French Communist Party is growing day by day."

    法省议会选举第二次投票结束
    法共为首的民主力量获更大胜利
    戴高乐党徒及右翼社会党头子又遭受一次惨败
    【新华社十七日讯】巴黎消息：法国省议会选举在十月十四日举行第二次投票。投票结果，以共产党为首的法国民主力量不但巩固了它在十月七日第一次投票时所获得的胜利，而且扩大了这个胜利；而法国反动力量却遭受了又一次的失败。
    在法国本土需要举行第二次投票的七百零二个选区中，共产党所获得的选票远较其他一切反动党派为多：它获得了一百零六万二千票，占总票数百分之二十七点五四，而第一次投票时则为百分之二十三点八；居第二位的社会党只得到六十九万八千票，占总票数百分之十八点一；而法西斯头子戴高乐的法兰西人民联盟仅得六十一万二千票，占总票数百分之十五点八。
    自从十月七日的选举表明法国共产党拥有广大人民的热烈拥护以后，法国各反动派，从右翼社会党的头子到戴高乐的党羽，在恐惧之余，都疯狂地勾结起来，向共产党进攻。法兰西人民联盟曾公然宣布“支持任何有希望打败其敌手共产党的候选人”。这样，右翼社会党、人民共和党、独立共和农民联盟、“左翼联盟”这些臭名远扬的所谓“第三”“第四”种力量各政党，就不但自相结成集团，而且明目张胆地和法兰西人民联盟合流，支持共同的候选人，这样来集中选票，制造多数。但是，尽管有这一切，共产党仍然获得了四十二个议席，和七日所得议席合计，共得七十八席，比一九四八年省议会选举时多得四十一席。同时，由于法国人民对法西斯主义是这样深恶痛绝，以致有许多反动党派，特别是社会党的地方组织不顾其上层领导机构的命令，毅然拒绝和戴高乐分子联盟，而接受了共产党在第一次投票后所提出来的保卫和平、民主、民族独立和劳动人民生活权利的最低纲领，成为共产党的同盟者而使自己获得了十八个议席。《真理报》驻巴黎记者朱可夫指出：这个事实极其有力地表明了法国广大群众已在走向统一的全国阵线的道路上跨进了一步。
    法国共产党机关报《人道报》十五日评论这次选举结果说：“第一，它揭露了社会党领袖们与戴高乐的勾结，也揭露了那些依靠社会党与戴高乐党的人们的真面目。第二，它再度证明了资产阶级民主的虚伪，这只是富人的民主。在选举中，法国共产党获得的票数最多，而获得的议席却最少。第三，它证明了团结在法国共产党周围的法国人民的团结日益增长。”
