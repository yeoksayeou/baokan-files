    The term "deprivation of public rights" is inappropriate.
    "Deprivation of political rights" should be used instead.

    Editor:
    Some courts still use the phrase "deprivation of public rights" when sentencing criminals. I think it should be changed to "deprivation of political rights." "Deprivation of public rights" comes from the old Six Codes and was a criminal punishment used by the reactionary Kuomintang government in the past. The term "citizen" simply does not exist now, so naturally there is no such criminal punishment as "deprivation of public rights." In the past, many reports and judgments from courts across the country published in government gazettes and communications still used the term "deprivation of public rights." This usage is inappropriate. I suggest that people's courts at all levels in all regions should pay attention to this in the future and immediately correct this usage.

                            Liu Jun
                            People's Court of Pingyuan County, Shandong Province

    Editor's Note: Comrade Liu Jun's suggestion is correct. The vast majority of people's court judgments have already changed to "deprivation of political rights." If judicial organs in various regions are still using "deprivation of public rights," they should correct it.

### “褫夺公权”的说法不妥当  应改用“剥夺政治权利”

    “褫夺公权”的说法不妥当
    应改用“剥夺政治权利”编辑同志：
    现在有些法院判处罪犯，还有用“褫夺公权”字样的，我认为应把它改为“剥夺政治权利”。“褫夺公权”系出自旧六法全书，是过去国民党反动政府所用的刑名。“公民”一说在现在根本没有，那自然就不会有“褫夺公权”的刑名。过去政报、通讯所载全国各地法院的报告、判决等文内，还有不少“褫夺公权”的字样，这种用法是不合适的。我建议各地各级人民法院今后应加以注意，立即纠正这种用法。
                            山东省平原县人民法院    刘钧
    编者按：刘钧同志的建议是正确的。各地人民法院的判决书中，绝大多数已改用“剥夺政治权利”。各地司法机关如仍有沿用“褫夺公权”的，应该改正。
