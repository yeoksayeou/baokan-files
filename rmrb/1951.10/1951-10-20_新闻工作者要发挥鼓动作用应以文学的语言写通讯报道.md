Journalists Should Use Literary Language to Write Feature Reports to Play a Mobilizing Role

To the Editor:

Ilya Ehrenburg's talk at the symposium of Chinese journalists was of great help to my writing methods and the use of language.

Ilya Ehrenburg said: "I think using literary language in newspapers can improve the newspapers without lowering them." This is absolutely true. Take Chairman Mao's classic work "On Coalition Government" as an example. There is a passage like this: "... The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have not been intimidated, conquered, or wiped out. They crawled out of the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the bodies of their comrades, and continued to fight..." Just these few words shook my whole heart and inspired me with infinite fighting power. The reason why Chairman Mao's articles can have a great mobilizing effect is not only because he summarized the experience of the Chinese revolutionary struggle from the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism, but also because he used the rich and vivid language of the motherland to mobilize every revolutionary with literary language. Therefore, in the struggle to strengthen the ideological character and popularization of newspapers, journalists should learn to use literary language to write feature reports, so as to give better play to the propaganda and mobilization role of newspapers.

### 新闻工作者要发挥鼓动作用应以文学的语言写通讯报道

    新闻工作者要发挥鼓动作用应以文学的语言写通讯报道编辑同志：
    伊里亚·爱伦堡在中国记者座谈会上的谈话，对我的写作方法和语言的运用，有很大帮助。
    伊里亚·爱伦堡说：“我觉得在报纸上采用文学的语言可以提高报纸，并不会把它降低。”这是千真万确的。就以毛主席的经典著作“论联合政府”为例，其中曾有这样一段话：“……中国共产党与中国人民并没有被吓倒、被征服、被杀绝，他们从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。……”仅仅这么几句话，就震动了我整个的心，鼓舞了我无限的战斗力量。毛主席的这些文章所以能有很大鼓动作用，不仅是因为他以马列主义的立场、观点和方法，总结了中国革命斗争的经验，丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义，而且是因为他运用了丰富、生动的祖国语言，以文学的语言鼓动着每一个革命者。所以，在为加强报纸的思想性和通俗化的斗争中，新闻工作者应学习以文学的语言，写作通讯报道，以更多地发挥报纸的宣传鼓动作用。
