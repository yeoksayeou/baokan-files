    India, China, and World Peace
    Sundar Lal, Member of the All-India Peace Council
    Friends have asked me about my views on China's movement to resist America and aid Korea, and on the peace movement in China and India to defend world peace. I would like to take this opportunity to express my views, which I believe are also the views of the majority of the Indian people.
    India has always stood for peace internationally. Today, India wholeheartedly upholds peace. We were originally within the scope of British territory and capitalist imperialism, and every Indian considered foreign rule in India as a long-term humiliation they suffered. Our country has a large population, but it was not armed. Under the wise leadership of Gandhi, we only gained freedom from British imperialism four years ago. Comrade Guo Moruo was right to say that day: "Gandhi was a martyr for peace." Gandhi was indeed a great advocate of peace. We hate any act of aggression by one country against another. We believe that every freedom-loving human being has a responsibility to do everything in their power to resist such aggression. Gandhi taught us a method of resisting aggression without violence, and we followed his remarkable method to achieve success; at the same time, he made it clear that in places where non-violent resistance techniques are not popular, or cannot be applied for some reason, even using armed forces to resist aggression becomes the sacred responsibility of the attacked country. He taught us that surrender to aggression is not only cowardly, but also a sin. Therefore, we, the Indian people, fully support our Chinese brothers in their struggle against aggression at home and abroad, and congratulate the Chinese people on their victory.
    In recent years, the Indian people have closely watched the policies and activities of the U.S. government in the Far East. We are saddened to see that the governments of some modern civilized countries have become so lamentably insane in their pursuit of military and economic control over other nations. We fully sympathize with the misfortune and suffering of the Korean people. The entire Indian people hope to see a unified Korea free from all foreign control, and maintain friendly relations with all its neighbors, especially the great People's Republic of China.
    Regarding the world peace movement, we deeply appreciate the position taken by China on this issue. We see how great Chairman Mao Zedong's nation-building cause is; and we are amazed to note the rapid development of various national construction activities under his leadership in the past two years. Such a genius for construction cannot but be a lover of peace among nations. When we return to our country, we must tell the Indian people what we know: Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest pillar of world peace today. We know that China did not join the Korean War until its borders were seriously threatened, in order to defend its territory from invasion. It is well known that our government warned the United States and the United Nations not to cross the 38th parallel at that time.
    Due to the inspiration we received from Gandhi, India has always advocated the elimination of war between countries. We attach great importance to the Soviet Union's proposal for simultaneous and gradual disarmament by all countries in the world, and the demand for an immediate ban on all atomic weapons. What we are worried about is that other major powers disagree with these proposals. India longs for the day when all countries, with mutual consent, abolish armaments and all weapons are destroyed or converted into plows; when mankind on Earth is unified, and all people feel and act like members of a common family. This is the hope of the Indian peace movement. In this movement, we are also making efforts to collect signatures for peace declarations, promote the signing of a five-power peace pact, and so on. We firmly believe that the true harmony and friendship between India and China will grow day by day, and it will become a solid and lasting contributor to peace.

    印度、中国和世界的和平
    全印和平理事会理事  森德拉尔
    朋友们曾经问过我对中国抗美援朝运动和中印两国保卫世界和平运动的看法。我趁这机会把我的看法表示出来，我相信这也就是大多数印度人民的看法。
    印度在国际上是一向站在和平方面的。今天的印度全心全意地维护着和平。我们本来是在英国领土和资本帝国主义的范围以内，每一个印度人认为印度的外族统治是他们所身受的长期侮辱。我国人口众多，可是没有武装起来。在甘地的英明领导之下，我们四年以前才从英帝国主义手里获得了自由。郭沫若同志那一天说得对：“甘地是和平烈士。”甘地正是一个最伟大的和平倡导者。凡是一个国家用任何方式侵略别的国家的行为，都是我们所憎恨的。我们相信，每一个爱好自由的人类，都有责任尽其所能来抵抗这样的侵略。甘地教导过我们一种不用暴力的抵抗侵略的方法，我们便遵循他那卓越的方法而获得成功；同时，他又明白表示过：在不用暴力的抵抗技术没有普及，或是为了某种理由不能应用的地方，即使用武装力量来抵抗侵略也变成了被攻击的国家的神圣责任。他教导过我们，对侵略的屈服，不但是怯弱，而且是罪恶。因此，我们印度人民完全支持中国兄弟们在国内国外反对侵略的斗争，并祝贺中国人民的胜利。
    最近几年来，印度人民密切注视着美国政府在远东的政策和活动。我们痛心地看到一些现代文明国家的政府为了追求对其他民族的军事和经济的控制，竟疯狂到这么可叹的程度。我们充分地同情着朝鲜人民的不幸和苦难。全印度人民希望见到统一的朝鲜脱离了一切外国的控制，而和它的一切邻国，尤其是和伟大的中华人民共和国保持友好的关系。
    关于世界和平运动，我们深深地赏识着中国在这问题上所采取的立场。我们看到伟大的中国领袖毛泽东主席的建国事业多么伟大；我们又不胜惊奇地注意到在他的领导之下，两年来国家的各项建设活动有着突飞猛进的发展。这样的建设天才，不能不说是各国间的和平的热爱者。我们回到本国去，一定要各就所知，告诉印度人民：毛泽东主席正是今天世界和平的一个最伟大的支柱。我们知道，中国直到国界受到了严重的威胁，方才加入了朝鲜战争，以求保卫国土不受侵犯。我国政府当时曾经警告美国和联合国勿越过三八线，这是众所共知的。
    由于我们从甘地所获得的启示，印度永远主张消灭国家与国家之间的战争。我们极端重视苏联所提出的世界各国同时逐步裁减军备的建议，以及立即禁止一切原子武器的要求。我们所忧虑的就是其它大国对这些建议不同意。印度渴望着这样的一天到来：那时候，所有的国家都在相互同意下废除了军备，所有武器都被毁弃或改为耕犁；那时候，地球上的人类实现了统一，所有的人在感觉和行动上，都像一个公共家庭里的成员一样。这就是印度和平运动的希望。在这个运动中，我们也正在尽力进行搜集和平宣言的签名，宣传签订五大国和平公约以及其他等。我们深信印中两国的真正和协和友谊将与日俱增，它将成为坚牢和持久和平的贡献者。
