    Experiences in Establishing Propaganda Workers in Various Organs
    Li Weiguang
    Propaganda workers in organs have been established successively in many places across the country. For example, in East China, according to incomplete statistics in August, there were already 2,481 propaganda workers in organs. In Liaodong Province, Northeast China, according to August statistics, there were already more than 3,300 propaganda workers in organs, accounting for 8 percent of the total number of propaganda workers in the province, second only to rural propaganda workers in number, and generally better in quality. In March of this year, there were already 175 propaganda workers directly under the Chahar South District Committee organs. The established propaganda workers in various places have generally played an important role in strengthening the Party's mass propaganda work.

    The role and achievements of the work of propaganda workers in organs are mainly reflected in the following points:

    1. Strengthened propaganda work among residents in the vicinity, and promoted the completion of local central tasks. During the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements, propaganda workers in organs in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City conducted propaganda among more than 100,000 residents. Propaganda workers in organs of the Northern Jiangsu District Party Committee often undertook the propaganda tasks of 45 security districts. Four propaganda workers in organs of the Jiaxing District Committee of Zhejiang Province conducted 31 propaganda sessions for residents in one month, reaching more than 2,500 people; under the education of the propaganda workers, the residents of the area successively exposed 17 counter-revolutionaries near the organs, greatly strengthening the security and defense work near the organs.

    2. Strengthened the Party's and the People's Government's connection with the masses. Because propaganda workers in organs of the Shandong Provincial People's Government conducted patriotic education among more than 3,000 resident households and helped the masses solve some difficult problems, they won unanimous praise from the masses. Many people said, "The cadres of the People's Government do not put on bureaucratic airs." "The Kuomintang reactionaries told the people not to talk about state affairs, but the People's Government wants the people to manage state affairs." When propaganda workers in organs of the Jiaxing District Committee of Zhejiang Province did not go to work among the residents for a few days, the residents asked the director of the residents' committee to invite them; the masses felt that the propaganda workers in the organs were closely related to them, and they felt uneasy if they did not discuss things with the propaganda workers or listen to their explanations.

    3. Enlivened the political and cultural life of the organs themselves and the masses in the vicinity. In their work, propaganda workers in organs helped the vicinity cultivate activists in mass propaganda work and established or enriched various mass propaganda and education organizations. For example, propaganda workers in organs of the Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee helped the residents' committee establish organizations such as cultural rooms, literacy classes, singing teams, and drama groups, which immediately enlivened the residents' political and cultural life, and thus laid the foundation for regular propaganda to the masses.

    The following preliminary experiences have been gained in East China, Northeast China, and other places regarding how to establish propaganda workers in organs:

    1. It is necessary to educate Party members and cadres in the organs to attach importance to the establishment of propaganda workers in the organs and break down ideological obstacles. At the beginning of the establishment of propaganda workers in organs, some comrades often had some incorrect understandings. For example: regarding propaganda work to the masses as only local work, and the organ branch need not do it; emphasizing that they are busy with work and do not have time for propaganda; and thinking that the organ only needs to focus on learning and there is no need to establish propaganda workers. In addition, some Party members and cadres, after entering the city, are not willing to approach the masses in their thinking and are not familiar enough with the various habits of urban residents, which also creates some resistance to the establishment of propaganda workers in organs. The organ Party committee should overcome all these obstacles through education when establishing propaganda workers, so that every cadre recognizes the significance and role of establishing propaganda workers in organs, and that propaganda workers in organs clearly understand their work tasks. After the establishment of propaganda workers, the organ Party committee should pay attention to their leadership and establish a regular system for inspecting and supervising the work of propaganda workers. The Party committees of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee organs and the Shandong Provincial-level organs have included this work in the patriotic covenants and work plans, which has greatly promoted the work of propaganda workers.

    2. The organ Party committee and the Party committee of the vicinity (municipal Party committee or district Party committee) should actively contact each other in leading the work of propaganda workers, and the Party committee of the vicinity should uniformly lead the work of organ propaganda workers among the residents. Because the propaganda workers in organs in Hangzhou City are led by the local Party organization and pay attention to giving play to the role of the residents' committee, the work has been carried out very smoothly. Conversely, because the propaganda workers in organs of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee did not go through local organizations and went directly to the residents to visit, it caused unnecessary suspicion among the masses, and the work did not achieve the desired results. Attention should also be paid to the use of propaganda workers in organs so as not to affect their daily work and study, and to prevent the phenomenon of being tight at first and then slackening and not being able to persist in propaganda regularly. In order to correct this, the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee stipulated that the main task of propaganda workers in organs is to carry out current affairs and political propaganda and propaganda on central tasks to local residents, and the local Party committee should not arrange all the specific tasks of each period to the propaganda workers in organs in the same way. This regulation is necessary to overcome the tendency to overuse propaganda workers in organs.

    3. The propaganda area and propaganda objects of propaganda workers in organs among the residents in the vicinity should be as fixed as possible. After uniformly dividing the work area, the propaganda workers in organs of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee fixed a propaganda team to a residential area, and a propaganda worker to a residents' group. Propaganda workers in organs of Shandong Province have all made divisions of labor, respectively leading and controlling mass propaganda and education organizations and tools such as local people's schools and blackboards in the vicinity. There are great benefits to doing work in this way, mainly because it allows propaganda workers in organs to establish regular contact with their propaganda objects, and to implement a responsibility system for propaganda work. For example, a propaganda worker reads the newspaper to a military family every day, and after a few days, through the introduction and contact of this military family, he formed a newspaper reading group with 12 people participating.

    4. To sum up, the methods of propaganda carried out by propaganda workers in organs among the residents in the vicinity are as follows: (1) Propaganda and visits from household to household. (2) Small-scale symposiums. (3) Propaganda through organizations such as blackboards, newspaper reading groups, and people's schools. (4) Cultivating and helping local propaganda workers and activists, and promoting them to carry out propaganda. (5) Conducting disguised propaganda and cartoon picture propaganda. (6) During major political movements or commemorative festivals, it can help the Party organs in the vicinity convene mass meetings and carry out propaganda in the meetings. The above-mentioned propaganda methods can be adopted by propaganda workers in organs, but in general, oral and small-scale propaganda should be the main focus, and special attention should be paid to carrying out work through and with the help of regular mass propaganda and education organizations.

    各地建立机关宣传员的经验
    李维光
    机关宣传员在全国许多地方已经陆续建立起来。例如华东地区的机关宣传员据八月份的不完全统计，已有二千四百八十一名。东北辽东省的机关宣传员据八月份统计已有三千三百余人，占该省宣传员总数的百分之八，其数目仅次于农村宣传员，而质量一般都较好。察南地委直属机关的宣传员在今年三月间已有一百七十五人。各地已建立起的机关宣传员，对于加强党的群众宣传工作，一般都起了重要的作用。
    机关宣传员工作的作用和成绩，主要表现在以下几点：
    一、加强了驻地居民中的宣传工作，推动了当地中心工作的完成。浙江省及杭州市的机关宣传员在抗美援朝与镇压反革命运动中，曾对十万以上居民进行了宣传。苏北区党委机关的宣传员经常担负着四十五个治安区的宣传任务。浙江嘉兴地委机关有四个宣传员在一个月中就对居民进行了三十一次宣传，受宣传的群众达二千五百余人；该地居民在宣传员的教育下，把机关附近的十七个反革命分子都先后检举出来，大大加强了机关附近的治安保卫工作。
    二、密切了党和人民政府对群众的联系。山东省人民政府机关的宣传员由于对驻地三千多户居民进行了爱国主义教育，并帮助群众解决一些疑难问题，因而获得了群众一致的好评。许多群众说：“人民政府的干部不摆官僚架子。”“国民党反动派是叫老百姓莫谈国事，人民政府却要人民管理国家大事。”浙江嘉兴地委机关的宣传员，有几天不到居民中去工作，居民就要求居民委员会主任去邀请；群众感到机关宣传员和他们密切相联，有事不和宣传员商量，不听宣传员解释，就有些不放心。
    三、活跃了本机关和驻地群众的政治、文化生活。机关宣传员在进行工作中，帮助驻地培养了群众宣传工作的积极分子，建立或充实了各种群众性的宣传教育组织。如浙江省委宣传部机关的宣传员帮助居民委员会成立了文化室、识字班、歌咏队、话剧组等组织，使居民的政治文化生活立刻就活跃起来，从此也就打下了对群众经常宣传的基础。
    机关宣传员应该怎样建立，在华东、东北等地已经取得了以下的初步经验：
    一、必须教育机关党员、干部重视机关宣传员的建立，打破思想上的障碍。建立机关宣传员之初，有些同志往往存在一些不正确的认识。例如：把对群众进行宣传工作，只看成是地方工作，机关支部不必去作；强调工作忙，没有时间去宣传；以及认为机关只须抓紧学习，无建立宣传员的必要等。另外，还有些党员、干部进到城市后，在思想上不大愿和群众接近，对城市居民的各种习惯不够熟悉，这也为建立机关宣传员造成一些阻力。这一切障碍，机关党委应该在建立宣传员时，首先经过教育予以克服，使每一干部认识到建立机关宣传员的意义和作用，使机关宣传员都明确认识自己的工作任务。宣传员建立以后，机关党委应注意对他们的领导，建立检查督促宣传员工作的经常制度。杭州市委机关和山东省省级机关的党委，都把这一工作列在爱国公约和工作计划以内，这对于推动宣传员工作有很大作用。
    二、机关党委和驻地的党委（市委或区委）应在领导宣传员的工作中互相主动联系，并由驻地党委统一领导机关宣传员对居民进行工作。杭州市的机关宣传员由于有地方党组织的领导，并注意发挥居民委员会的作用，就使工作进行得很顺利。相反的，嘉兴市委机关的宣传员由于不通过地方组织，自己直接到居民中去访问，结果引起了群众不必要的怀疑，工作没有收到应有的成效。对机关宣传员的使用，还应注意不要影响其日常的工作和学习，防止先紧后松不能经常坚持宣传的现象。辽东省委为纠正这一点，曾规定：机关宣传员的主要任务是向当地居民进行时事政治宣传和中心任务的宣传，地方党委不应把每一时期所有的具体任务，都照样布置给机关宣传员。这种规定，对克服过重地使用机关宣传员的偏向，是必要的。
    三、机关宣传员的宣传地区和宣传对象，应该尽量做到固定化。杭州市委机关宣传员在统一划分工作地区后，一个宣传员小组固定到一个居民区宣传，一个宣传员固定到居民小组宣传。山东省省级机关宣传员都做了分工，分别领导和掌握驻地的民校，黑板报等群众宣传教育组织和工具。这样去进行工作有极大的好处，主要的是可以使机关宣传员和自己的宣传对象建立经常的联系，并可以实行宣传工作的负责制。如有一个宣传员每天向一军属读报，几天后经过这家军属的介绍联络，就组成了一个有十二人参加的读报组。
    四、机关宣传员在驻地居民中进行宣传的方式，归结起来有以下几种：（一）逐户宣传和访问。（二）小型座谈会。（三）通过黑板报、读报组、民校等组织进行宣传。（四）培养和帮助地方宣传员、积极分子，推动他们去宣传。（五）进行化装宣传和漫画图片宣传。（六）在大的政治运动或纪念节日可帮助驻地党的机关召开群众大会，并在大会中作宣传。上述的几种宣传方式，机关宣传员都可采用，但一般应以口头的、小型的宣传为主，并应特别注意通过和帮助群众经常的宣传教育组织去进行工作。
