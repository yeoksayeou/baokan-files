	Judicial Section of Zhuxi County Lightly Sentences Criminals Violating the Marriage Law
	Yunyang People's Court Branch Proposes Revised Judgment
	The Yunyang Branch of the Hubei Provincial People's Court disagrees with the excessively lenient sentence passed down by the Judicial Section of the Zhuxi County People's Government on Wang Changxue for interfering with marital freedom and beating the woman Ming Xiuying, and has proposed a revised judgment.
	In February 1950, Ming Xiuying of the Ninth Village, Second District of Zhuxi County, Hubei Province, married Li Jialong of the same village (Ninth Village). The relationship between the two was poor after the marriage. In December of the same year (lunar calendar), Ming Xiuying filed for divorce with the County Judicial Section. At that time, the Judicial Section was busy suppressing counter-revolutionaries, so it referred the case back to the District People's Government for mediation; the District People's Government then referred it to the Village People's Government for mediation. At this time, Wang Changxue, the group leader and militia platoon leader of Xiuying's residence, attempted to have Ming Xiuying marry his clansman Wang Yuchuan, and told Xiuying: "If you agree to my request, I guarantee you can get a divorce." Xiuying did not agree. Wang Changxue then arranged with village head Wang Yuxin to jointly threaten Xiuying, saying: "If you don't agree, you won't be allowed to divorce. We won't say good things, and the village won't write good letters. It won't work in the district, and it won't work in the county. The higher-ups will only act based on what we say." Xiuying still did not agree. Wang Changxue held a grudge. In March of this year, the District People's Government wrote a letter of introduction for Xiuying to the County Judicial Section to handle the divorce, along with a document from the village (generally saying that the relationship between the two was not too bad and they should not divorce). The County Judicial Section unilaterally believed the village's material, believing that the relationship between the two had not reached the point of rupture, and ruled that the divorce was not allowed, advising both parties to return home and concentrate on production. After Xiuying returned home, Li Jialong taunted her with words like "You can't escape my grasp in the end" and "Divorce is nonsense," and arguments ensued. Li Jialong, thinking he had "won the lawsuit," reported to group leader Wang Changxue, falsely claiming: "Ming Xiuying is causing trouble at home and beating her father, requesting sanctions." Wang Changxue, to vent his old hatred, under the pretext of "maintaining local security," ordered the militia to tie up Xiuying; village head Wang Yuxin also helped gather more than 30 women from nearby to hold a struggle session. Wang Changxue ordered Xiuying to kneel on the ground, hitting her with a wooden stick and asking: "Do you still want a divorce?" He only stopped when Xiuying was forced to agree "I don't want to divorce anymore." Wang Changxue was not satisfied and falsely accused Xiuying of "wanting to poison Li Jialong's entire family," forcing Xiuying to confess. Xiuying firmly denied it. Wang Changxue then said to the women present: "Should such a person be struggled against?" Usually the women were afraid of him, and when asked, they had to say "Yes." This went on for three or four hours. In the middle, village head Wang Yuxin also participated in tying up and beating Ming Xiuying. After the struggle, Wang Changxue forged a written record of Ming Xiuying admitting to poisoning Li Jialong's entire family, and stipulated that Ming Xiuying was not allowed to leave the gate for three years. Xiuying suffered serious injuries from this beating, and only reported it to the District People's Government on the seventh day. The District People's Government investigated and found the situation to be true, and forwarded the case to the county. After the County Judicial Section examined the wounds and sent personnel to investigate the scene of the incident, it was proven that the situation was true, and the masses reflected that Wang Changxue had always had a very bad work style, often beating and scolding people, and demanding that the government punish him. The Judicial Section made the following judgment: The relationship between Li Jialong and Ming Xiuying had indeed broken down and reached the point where they could not live together, and the judgment was changed to divorce Li Jialong and Ming Xiuying; Wang Changxue interfered with marital freedom, abused his power, and beat Ming Xiuying out of spite, and should be held criminally responsible, sentencing Wang Changxue to a suspended sentence of six months; the parties involved in the case, such as Wang Yuxin, were given criticism and education respectively.
	The Yunyang Branch of the Hubei Provincial People's Court expressed its disagreement with the judgment of the Zhuxi County Judicial Section, believing that Wang Changxue was a militia platoon leader and should be a model of law-abiding and should assist the government in implementing policies and regulations among the masses. Wang Changxue not only did not do this, but interfered with marital freedom, abused his power, struggled against and beat Ming Xiuying who was seeking marital freedom, and then forged confessions and prohibited Ming Xiuying from moving freely, which is a serious violation of the law. The Zhuxi County Judicial Section only sentenced Wang Changxue to a suspended sentence of six months (the judgment did not have a principal sentence, and only sentencing a suspended sentence of six months is inappropriate), and only gave Wang Yuxin criticism and education, which is too lenient. In addition, Wang Yuxin helped Wang Changxue gather women and participated in struggling against and beating Ming Xiuying, and should be a defendant. The Zhuxi County Judicial Section's judgment that Wang Yuxin was a "related person" is inappropriate. The opinion of the Yunyang Branch of the Hubei Provincial People's Court on the judgment of this case is: Wang Changxue should be sentenced to three years of imprisonment; Wang Yuxin helped Wang Changxue threaten and beat Ming Xiuying, and jointly convened a meeting with Wang Changxue to struggle against Ming Xiuying, and should also be given appropriate punishment. The Yunyang Branch of the Hubei Provincial People's Court has instructed the Zhuxi County Judicial Section to implement it in accordance with the above opinions.

    竹溪县司法科轻判违犯婚姻法的案犯
    郧阳人民法院分院提出改判意见
    湖北省人民法院郧阳分院不同意竹溪县人民政府司法科对王昌学干涉婚姻自由、殴打妇女明秀英的过轻判决，提出改判意见。
    湖北省竹溪县二区九村明秀英于一九五○年二月与本村（九村）李家隆结婚。婚后双方感情恶劣。明秀英于同年旧历十二月到县司法科提出离婚。当时司法科忙于镇压反革命工作，遂将此案介绍回区人民政府请其调解；区人民政府又让村人民政府调解。此时，秀英住地组长兼村民兵班长王昌学，企图让明秀英嫁给他的本族王宇川，便对秀英说：“如果你答应了我的要求，我包管你能离婚。”秀英不答应。王昌学便约好闾长王宇新，共同威胁秀英说：“你不答应，就不准你离婚。我们不说好话，村里写信也不写好话，到区里也离不了，到县里也不行。上面要根据我们的话才能办事。”秀英仍不答应。王昌学怀恨在心。今年三月间，区人民政府给秀英写了介绍信到县司法科办理离婚手续，并附有村上的材料一份（大意是说双方感情并不太坏，不能离婚）。县司法科片面地相信了村里的材料，认为双方感情并未达到破裂程度，即判决不准离婚，劝双方回家安心生产。秀英回家之后，李家隆即以“终究逃不出我的手掌”、“离婚是胡闹”等语相讥讽，并发生争吵。李家隆自以为“赢了官司”，又向组长王昌学报告，谎称：“明秀英在家横吵横闹，殴打父亲，请求制裁。”王昌学为解旧恨，乃以“维持地方治安”为名，命民兵将秀英捆起；闾长王宇新也帮助召集附近妇女三十多人，开起斗争会来。王昌学命令秀英跪在地上，用木棒打一下问一句：“你还离婚吗？”直到秀英被迫答应“不愿离了”才住手。王昌学还不满足，又诬陷秀英“想用毒药毒死李家隆全家”，迫使秀英承认。秀英坚不承认。王昌学便向到会的妇女说：“这样的人该斗不该斗？”平时妇女都害怕他，见问，只好说“该斗”。这样一直斗争了三四个钟头。中间，闾长王宇新也参加捆打明秀英。斗争之后，王昌学又伪造明秀英承认毒害李家隆全家的口供笔录，并规定明秀英三年不许出大门。秀英遭此毒打，身受重伤，直到第七天才到区人民政府报告。区人民政府调查情况属实，遂将此案转送到县，经县司法科验明伤痕，又派员前往肇事地点调查，证明情况属实，且群众反映王昌学一贯作风很坏，时常打人骂人，要求政府予以惩办。司法科就作了如下判决：李家隆与明秀英的感情确已破裂，达到不堪同居的程度，改判李家隆与明秀英离婚；王昌学干涉婚姻自由，滥用职权，挟愤棒打明秀英，应负刑事责任，判处王昌学缓刑六个月；对本案关系人王宇新等分别进行批评教育。
    湖北省人民法院郧阳分院对于竹溪县司法科的判决表示不能同意，认为王昌学是民兵班长，应为守法模范，并应协助政府将政策法令贯彻到群众中去。王昌学不但没有这样做，竟干涉婚姻自由，滥用职权，斗争殴打要求婚姻自由的明秀英，事后又伪造口供，禁止明秀英行动自由，这是严重的违法行为。竹溪县司法科只对王昌学判缓刑六个月（该判决没有主刑，仅判缓刑六个月是不适当的），对王宇新只给以批评教育，是过轻的。此外，王宇新帮同王昌学召集妇女，并参与斗争殴打明秀英，应为被告，竹溪县司法科的判决中认为王宇新是“关系人”，是不妥当的。湖北省人民法院郧阳分院对此案的判决意见是：王昌学处有期徒刑三年；王宇新曾帮同王昌学威胁和殴打明秀英，并与王昌学共同召集妇女开会斗争明秀英，也应给以适当处分。湖北省人民法院郧阳分院已指示竹溪县司法科按照上述意见执行。
