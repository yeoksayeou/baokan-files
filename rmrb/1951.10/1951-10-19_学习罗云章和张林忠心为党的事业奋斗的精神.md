    Learning from Luo Yunzhang and Zhang Lin's Spirit of Loyalty to the Party's Cause
    Editor:
    I was deeply moved after reading about the exemplary deeds of the Communist Party members Luo Yunzhang and Zhang Lin. In the heroic struggle against the enemy, one lost a leg and the other lost his eyesight, but they did not become complacent because of this, nor did they become depressed because of their disabilities. This precisely demonstrates the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. But what about me? Sometimes when I get sick, I feel annoyed and want to transfer to a less strenuous job to take care of my health. What a selfish idea! Now I am determined to overcome this erroneous thinking and learn from Comrades Luo Yunzhang and Zhang Lin's spirit of loyalty to the Party's cause.

    学习罗云章和张林忠心为党的事业奋斗的精神编辑同志：
    我读了共产党员罗云章、张林的模范事迹后，深受感动。他们两人在英勇的对敌斗争中，一个没有了腿，一个双目失明，但他们并没有因此居功自傲，也没有因残废而意志消沉，这正表现了一个共产党员的高贵的品质。可是我呢？有时得点病就感到烦闷，想调换一个比较轻松的工作，以照顾自己的身体。这是多么自私自利的想法。现在我决心克服这种错误思想，学习罗云章、张林二同志忠心为党的事业奋斗的精神。
