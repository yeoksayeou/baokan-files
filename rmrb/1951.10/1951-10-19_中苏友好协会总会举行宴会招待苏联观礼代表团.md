Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters held a banquet at 6:00 PM on the 18th to host the Soviet People's Observation Delegation. A symposium was also held before the banquet. The head of the Soviet People's Observation Delegation, Solovyov, and all members of the delegation were invited to attend. Shen Junru and Li Jishen, vice presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, directors Shao Lizi, Cai Tingkai, Peng Zemin, and Tan Tiwu, Secretary-General Qian Junrui, Deputy Secretaries-General Yan Baohang, Lai Yali, and Zhao Zhongchi, and heads of various departments of the association attended the reception. Liu Ningyi, Liu Guanyi, Deng Yingchao, and other heads of people's organizations were invited to accompany them. There were more than forty guests in total.

The symposium began with Li Jishen, vice president of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, introducing the association's work achievements over the past two years and its future direction. Vice President Li pointed out that thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party of China and governments at all levels, and the assistance of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has grown enormously. It is expected to reach 50 million members next year. Vice President Li said: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association recently held its first National Congress and passed a resolution recommending to the people of the whole country that every February be designated as "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month."

Secretary-General Qian Junrui, on behalf of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and all its members, expressed his gratitude to the Soviet People's Observation Delegation and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, thanking the Soviet People's Observation Delegation for bringing the profound friendship of the Soviet people and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries for the valuable gifts they gave to the association to celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters—five propaganda vehicles equipped with projectors, generators, radios, and loudspeakers. Secretary-General Qian said that this will certainly have a great impact on the association's future work and on the development of the great friendship between the two peoples.

Yakovlev, a member of the Soviet People's Observation Delegation and Vice Chairman of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, then spoke. He said: The unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will inevitably be consolidated and developed day by day. Because this friendship is built on the basis of equality and mutual respect, the Chinese and Soviet people have common enemies and common friends, and the two peoples love and help each other. He said that after returning home, they would first convey the friendship of the Chinese people and the spirit of bravery and diligence of the Chinese people to the Soviet people. Finally, he asked the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters to strive to introduce Chinese culture and art to the Soviet people in the future.

The banquet ended at 8:00 PM.
