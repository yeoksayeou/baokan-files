The first phase of the project to harness the Huai River was completed at the end of June this year. The entire plan for harnessing the Huai River is a massive undertaking to change the natural landscape of the entire Huai River basin. The completed first phase has initially relieved the threat of severe floods in the Huai River basin, ensuring a full harvest in the Huai River basin this year. Many more massive projects are continuing and being prepared.

The water disasters in the Huai River basin have been an unresolved problem for thousands of years in Chinese history. Why has the new China, in just one year since its founding, initially solved this problem and begun to control and utilize the water flow, turning the millennia-old water disasters into permanent water conservancy? The most important and fundamental reason is that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, overthrew the rule of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism, and established a people's democratic system. This is a fundamental change in the internal class relations and external relations of our country. This is an earth-shattering change that permeates all aspects. This change has cleared and is clearing all obstacles blocking the path of production development in our country, thus creating a rapid increase in the entire social productive forces. The great achievements of the Huai River harnessing project are a concrete and prominent example reflecting this change. Without the people's democratic system, the rapid and significant achievements in harnessing the Huai River would be incomprehensible.

The superiority of the people's democratic system is concretely reflected in the Huai River harnessing work, vividly manifested in the following three issues: First, harnessing the Huai River is for the people; Second, harnessing the Huai River relies on the people; Third, the Huai River harnessing work is led by the people's government under the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party). These three points are the fundamental keys determining the nature, scale, and magnitude of achievements of a project. They are also the fundamental differences between our Huai River harnessing project and the water conservancy work of the past feudal era, semi-colonial and semi-feudal era, and reactionary capitalist countries. To summarize the experiences of the year and further improve the work, we should first grasp these three basic keys.

Harnessing the Huai River is for the People

For whom is the Huai River harnessed? This is a fundamental question that is encountered first when determining investment direction, considering project plans, and calculating economic benefits. This question most easily reveals the nature of a country's regime, class relations, and its stance on water conservancy work. In the past feudal era and semi-colonial and semi-feudal era, the direction of water conservancy work was to serve the interests of a small handful of feudal rulers and imperialists. In capitalist countries, it is to serve the interests of a few monopoly capitalists. Our country is a people's regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, our water conservancy work is to serve the current and long-term interests of all the people, especially workers and peasants.

A comparison of the past and present policies for harnessing the Huai River will clearly show this difference. From 1194 to 1949, when the country was basically liberated, the history of harnessing the Huai River can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage was from 1194 to 1855, when the Yellow River and the Huai River merged. During the six hundred years of the Ming and Qing dynasties, the policy of harnessing the Huai River always followed a policy of maintaining the "grain transport" of the Grand Canal as the primary focus. The basic policy of the feudal rulers at that time was to suppress the development of industry and commerce and to try to bind the peasants to the land, because they had to keep the productive forces stagnating in the stage of natural economy in order to maintain their feudal dynasty's rule. Then, why did they attach so much importance to maintaining waterway traffic? The reason is simple: it was for the so-called "grain transport" at that time. The grain transport was not for the convenience of the people, but for the special needs of the feudal rulers. Both the Ming and Qing dynasties had their capitals in Beijing, and the food supply in the north was not enough to maintain the needs of their huge military and government institutions. Therefore, every year, they had to collect millions of stones of food from Jiangnan and transport them to Beijing. Therefore, they regarded the smooth flow of grain transport as the lifeline of the rulers, completely disregarding the serious flood disasters suffered by the masses along the Huai River. The masses along the Huai River had a folk song that said: "Speaking of Fengyang, talking about Fengyang, Fengyang was a good place, since the Emperor Zhu came out, there were nine years of famine out of ten years." This specifically proves the people's bitter hatred for the emperors' work of harnessing the Huai River. The second stage was from 1855, after the Yellow River flowed northward to the sea in Shandong, to 1938, before Chiang Kai-shek breached the dike. During this period, the Yellow River began to separate from the Huai River, which was originally the best opportunity to harness the Huai River. However, the situation at that time was precisely when the imperialist aggression began to turn Chinese society into a semi-colony. From the feudal rulers of the late Qing Dynasty to the reactionary government of the Kuomintang, they only considered how to suppress the people's revolutionary movement to meet the demands of the imperialists and maintain their crumbling regime, completely ignoring the interests of the people. Therefore, the situation of the Huai River did not improve. In 1931, the Huai River suffered a huge flood, inundating more than 70 million mu of land. The Kuomintang reactionaries used the pretext of harnessing the Huai River to obtain a huge traitorous loan from American imperialists, but only used a very small part of it to harness the Huai River, and used most of it to suppress the revolution and expand the bureaucratic capital of the four major families. Their touted harnessing of the Huai River was basically a scam. As for its specific engineering plan, due to the feudal separatism of the ruling class, from a global perspective, it was biased towards the interests of the landlords of northern Jiangsu, completely ignoring the interests of Henan and northern Anhui. In the projects in northern Jiangsu, the problem of flood control was not solved, but two or three ship locks were built in isolation on the Grand Canal, which was only for the benefit of commercial capital. The third stage was from 1938, after the Yellow River and Huai River merged, to before the national liberation. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek used his sinful blood-stained hands to dig up the Yellow River dikes, causing the Yellow River to flood into the Huai River again, causing nine years of great disaster in the Huai River basin, further exposing the brutal nature of the rulers. In this stage, the Kuomintang did not care about the flood disaster of the Huai River at all, allowing it to flood every year. Only the anti-Japanese democratic regimes that grew up behind enemy lines in central China at that time carried out some dike projects, while the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang constantly destroyed these dikes. Under the brutal and selfish reactionary rule, the people's hopes could not be realized. This is a more obvious proof.

Today, our goal of harnessing the Huai River is very clear. First, it is for the urgent demands of the 55 million farmers in the Huai River basin, and it also fully meets the needs of the entire national construction. In terms of China's population, the agricultural population accounts for the largest proportion. Therefore, we have consistently placed water conservancy work directly related to the interests of farmers in a very important position. One of the important differences between our New Democratic economy and the economy of capitalist countries is that the prosperity of capitalist industry is built on the basis of the exploitation, oppression, poverty, and bankruptcy of farmers, while the road to the development of the New Democratic economy is to first focus on the restoration and development of agricultural production, expand the domestic market, and stimulate the general development of industry. Because of the development of industry, it in turn improves agricultural production. Because the relationship between our workers and peasants is on the road of mutual assistance in the economic and political aspects, and in the communist era in the future, the difference between the city and the countryside will be fundamentally eliminated. Therefore, at the beginning of the founding of the country, we began to plan to fundamentally manage all major rivers in the country to meet the needs of agricultural production. After the flood in the Huai River in 1950, although our domestic economy was still in difficulty, the wise Central People's Government decided to immediately start the Huai River's fundamental treatment project, and required that in the first year, the huge flood disaster be basically eliminated. This is not only the long-cherished hope of the people in the Huai River basin, but also meets the needs of the entire national economic development.

Harnessing the Huai River Relies on the People

Who does the Huai River harnessing rely on? This is another fundamental difference between us and the reactionary ruling class in water conservancy work. In the past, the water management work of the reactionary ruling class, because it was for the benefit of a few ruling classes, so their projects relied on feudal landlords, relied on corrupt bureaucratic institutions, relied on the technology and production of imperialist countries. Our Huai River harnessing project, because it is for the benefit of the people, so our project relies on the vast masses of people, relies on administrative and technical cadres with a high degree of the idea of serving the people, relies on our own technology and production capacity, and learns from the advanced experience of socialist countries.

This fundamental difference makes our Huai River harnessing project and the water conservancy work of the reactionary rule period show principled differences in engineering plans, engineering implementation, engineering funding and work efficiency. Because the project of the reactionary rule era relied on feudal landlords, corrupt bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and imperialism, their engineering plans were full of unrealistic and erroneous survey data and engineering designs. Due to the selfish characteristics of the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, some projects also seriously existed with the idea of ​​"using the neighbor as a gully," causing endless disputes between places. Their engineering implementation can only take the form of corvée labor or hired labor. Wherever there is a project, there is a large amount of corruption and exploitation. All projects, large and small, have the fact of "cutting corners." There is no talk of safety and economy. Workers are engaged in labor under the circumstances of being exploited, enslaved, and whipped, and naturally they will not actively improve working methods and improve work efficiency. Because all highly technical projects rely on the technology and production of imperialist countries, and the attitude of imperialist countries towards colonies is fundamentally to restrict the development of colonial industries to maintain their own exploitation position. Therefore, it is impossible for it to truly help the colonies, and even if it helps to organize some projects, it is only to facilitate the plunder of the raw materials of the colonial countries, a large amount of exploitation of the surplus value of the colonial countries' laboring people, and to find sales markets for the production of imperialist steel, cement, and wood. Therefore, the larger the project, the more it increases China's semi-colonial dependence on imperialist countries.

In contrast to this situation, because our Huai River harnessing project relies on the conscious efforts of the 55 million people along the Huai River and the people of the whole country, our engineering plan comprehensively integrates the will and requirements of all the people in the Huai River basin. With the help of the masses, we have corrected the errors in various survey data, so that our engineering design can be practical. The implementation of our project does not take the form of corvée or hired labor. Through extensive political mobilization and mass movements, and through democratic organizational forms, we have made 2.2 million migrant workers truly the masters of the project, and therefore the work efficiency has been greatly improved. In the case where the broad masses of people regard the Huai River harnessing as their own business, relying on the creativity and inventions of the masses, we solved the problem of taking soil in the ice and snow, solved the problem of taking sand and gravel and soil in the water, and enabled many old-fashioned tools to exert their highest effectiveness. At the same time, we also learned the technology of using modern tools. We did 200 million cubic meters of earthwork in nine months, and completed the huge Runheji water diversion gate project in one hundred days. The Shi Mantan Reservoir project took less than half a year. This is unimaginable under any reactionary regime. Because we rely on our own technology and production for highly technical reservoir and dam projects, the completion of each of our projects, in turn, has improved our own level in production technology, and thus constantly increased our confidence in our work.

The Working Class's Leadership of the Huai River Harnessing Project

The above is said to be the two main characteristics of the Huai River harnessing project. The reason why we can realize these two main characteristics in the entire project is due to the leading role of the working class in ideology, politics, organization, and technology. Our country is a people's democratic country, and the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party) is deeply implemented in all our undertakings. As for its specific manifestations in the Huai River harnessing project, it is mainly manifested in the following aspects.

First, it is reflected in the ideological leadership of the Central and local People's Governments over the entire Huai River harnessing plan. In the past, the reason why the Huai River harnessing project could not solve the problem of the Huai River, apart from other reasons, there was a common reason, that is, the management of this river was completely carried out from a local point of view, and was fragmented, which only caused contradictions and conflicts between the upper, middle and lower reaches, and could not solve any problems. This situation is a concrete reflection of China's feudal land system in water conservancy. Our current Huai River harnessing project is exactly the opposite. From planning to construction, the overall point of view is implemented everywhere. In the planning of the project, the policy of overall planning, storage and discharge are given first priority. In the design and construction of the project, it is emphasized that the upper, middle and lower reaches should be taken into account. The principle of local subordination to the overall situation and small interests subordination to large interests is implemented throughout. And all this is precisely the great thinking that the working class possesses alone. It is precisely this working class's overall point of view and global thinking that has enabled us to thoroughly eliminate the poison of localism in the Huai River harnessing project. All kinds of conflicting interests between places have been satisfactorily resolved under a unified plan, thus making the Huai River harnessing project plan the most economical and reasonable plan.

Second, it is reflected in the role of advanced production technology on the project. It was mentioned earlier that overall planning, storage and discharge are the outstanding features of the Huai River harnessing project, but this policy of overall planning, storage and discharge must be based on advanced production technology to be produced. Only under the condition that the Chinese working class has mastered modern manufacturing industry and construction technology, can we imagine relying on our own strength to build so many reservoir projects and such a huge control project as Runheji water diversion gate, so as to intercept water flow, utilize water flow, and turn water harm into water conservancy. If the Chinese working class does not have such advanced production technology now, we will have to remain stagnant in the passive defense stage, and it is impossible to achieve the ideal of "using water to benefit" now.

Third, it is reflected in the organization and education of the broad masses of peasants. The Huai River harnessing project mainly relies on the strength of the vast number of peasants, but the advanced organization of the working class must be learned so that the strength of the peasants can be fully utilized. The high degree of organization shown in this Huai River harnessing project and the huge transportation work, and the competition movement in the earthwork project that is one climax after another, are not the inherent style of small producers, but the high expression of collectivism. Under the slogan of "Farmers all over the world are one family", migrant workers from all over the country are full of mutual assistance and love. In order to solve the contradiction between Huai River harnessing and agricultural production, most areas generally carried out mutual assistance organizations in the front and rear (Huai River harnessing is the front, and agricultural production is the rear). In order to build reservoirs, a part of the masses must be relocated. The habit of peasants is originally "attachment to the land", but under the call of "one household moves, thousands of households prosper. One household moves, thousands of households are settled", the peasants in the reservoir area happily moved to the new area, and received a warm welcome and care from the local masses. All this shows that the broad masses of peasants have accepted the advanced ideas and organizational education of the working class.

Fourth, it is reflected in the direct support of the working class for the Huai River harnessing project. In the Runheji water diversion gate project, in order to produce the machinery and steel needed for the installation project, workers in more than 100 factories in Shanghai worked day and night and persisted for several months. In order to ensure that the accuracy and durability of various mechanical equipment fully meet the engineering requirements, in the design and manufacture, they did not hesitate to study and modify repeatedly, and sent their best representatives to the construction site to assist in the installation and testing work. This shows the great concern and concrete help of the working class to the peasant brothers in the country of worker-peasant alliance. This is absolutely impossible in the China of the reactionary rule era and in capitalist countries.

Strive for Greater Achievements

The project we did this year is only the first phase of the Huai River harnessing plan. Although the achievements this year are great, in the process of implementation, we have also taken wrong and winding roads on individual issues. The reason why we can achieve such results is because under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we have initially grasped the above three characteristics. The reason why we still have individual errors is that we have not fully and thoroughly realized these three characteristics. Now the second phase of the Huai River harnessing project is about to begin, and the project in 1952 is a more huge and more difficult task than the project in 1951. Comrades, we must improve our thinking and technical level, we must strengthen our organizational leadership, do not be arrogant and complacent, and continue to move forward on the basis of victory!

    人民民主制度是治淮力量的源泉
    治淮委员会主任  曾山
    治理淮河的第一期工程，已经在今年六月底全部完成了。治理淮河的全部的计划，是一个改变整个淮河流域自然面貌的巨大的计划。已经完成的第一期工程，已经初步地解除了淮河流域严重水灾的威胁，保证了今年淮河流域全年的丰收，现在还有许多更为巨大的工程，正在继续进行和准备进行。
    淮河流域的水患，本来是我国历史上几千年未曾解决的问题，为什么新中国建立伊始，在短短的一年的时间内，就初步地解决了这个问题，并且开始控制水流，利用水流，要把千年的水害变成永远的水利呢？其最重要最根本的原因，是中国人民在共产党和毛主席领导下，推翻了帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义的统治，建立了人民民主的制度。这是我国社会内部阶级关系和对外关系上一个根本的变化，这是普及到一切方面的一个翻天覆地的变化，这一个变化，扫清了并且正在扫清着阻塞在我国生产发展的道路上的一切的障碍，因而造成整个社会生产力的飞速的提高，治淮工程的伟大的成就，正是反映了这个变化的一个具体的突出的例子。假如没有人民民主制度，那么，治淮的迅速的巨大的成就，就成为不可理解的事情。
    人民民主制度的优越性，在治淮工作上的具体的反映，鲜明地表现在以下的三个问题上：第一、治淮是为了人民；第二、治淮是依靠人民；第三、治淮工作是由工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的人民政府来领导的。这三点是决定一个工程的性质、规模及其成就大小的根本关键，也是我们的治淮工程和过去封建时代、半殖民地半封建时代、以及反动的资本主义国家的水利工作的基本区别。为了总结一年的经验，并进一步提高工作，我们应当首先掌握这三个基本关键。
    治淮是为了人民
    治淮是为了谁？这是决定投资方向、考虑工程计划、计算经济效益的时候，所首先遇到的一个基本问题，在这个问题上最容易看出一个国家的政权性质、阶级关系，和它对水利工作所采取的立场。在过去的封建时代和半殖民地半封建时代，水利工作的方向，是为一小撮封建统治者和帝国主义的利益而服务，在资本主义国家，是为少数的垄断资本家的利益而服务，我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为主体的人民大众的政权，因此，我们的水利工作，则是为全体人民，首先是工人和农民的目前的和长远的利益而服务。
    试就过去和现在的治淮的方针，做一个比较，就可以明显看出这一个区别。从一一九四年到一九四九年全国基本解放，治淮的历史大体上可分为三个阶段，第一个阶段是从一一九四年到一八五五年黄河与淮河合流的时期，六百余年间明清两个封建王朝，治淮的方针始终遵循着一个政策，就是以维持运河的“漕运”为主的政策。当时的封建统治者在经济上的基本方针，是抑制工商业的发展，竭力把农民束缚在土地上，因为必须让生产力停滞在自然经济的阶段，才能维持他们的封建王朝的统治，那么，他们为什么又如此重视航道交通的维持呢？原因很简单，就是为了那时候的所谓“漕运”。漕运并不是为了人民的便利，而是为了封建统治者特殊的需要。明清两个王朝，都是建都北京，北方的食粮，不足以维持其庞大的军政机构的需要，因此每年必须从江南搜括几百万石的食粮，运到北京。所以他们把漕运畅通看做了统治者生存的命脉，完全不顾沿淮群众因此受到的严重的洪水泛滥的灾害。沿淮的群众有一首歌谣说：“说凤阳，道凤阳，凤阳本是好地方，自从出了朱皇帝，十年倒有九年荒。”这具体证明了人民对于帝王的治淮工作的刺骨的怨恨。第二个阶段是从一八五五年黄河北流到山东入海以后，到一九三八年蒋介石掘堤以前。在这一时期黄河开始脱离淮河，本来是治理淮河的一个最好的机会，可是当时的情况正是帝国主义的侵略，使中国社会开始沦落为半殖民地的时候，从清末的封建统治者到国民党反动政府，只考虑怎样镇压人民的革命运动，以满足帝国主义的要求，并维持其摇摇欲坠的政权，根本不考虑人民的利益，所以淮河的情况，并没有得到改善。一九三一年淮河发生巨大水灾，淹地七千万亩以上，国民党反动派曾藉口治淮向美帝国主义者进行一笔巨大的卖国的借款，却只用其中极小的一部分来进行治淮，而把大部分使用在镇压革命和扩大四大家族的官僚资本上。其所标榜的治淮，基本上是一个骗局。至于其具体的工程计划，由于统治阶级的封建割据性，从全局来看，是偏袒了苏北的地主阶级的利益，完全忽略了河南和皖北的利益。在苏北的工程中，也没有解决防洪的问题，却孤立地在运河上修筑了两三个船闸，这只是为了商业资本的利益。第三个阶段，是一九三八年黄淮合流以后，到全国解放以前。一九三八年蒋介石用罪恶的血手，挖掘黄河堤防，使黄河再度泛滥入淮，造成淮河流域九年的大患，更充分暴露统治者残暴的本质。在这个阶段，国民党对于淮河水患根本不管，每年任其泛滥，只有当时在华中敌后成长起来的抗日民主政权，才作了一些堤防工程，而敌伪和国民党反而对这些堤防不断加以破坏。在残暴自私的反动统治之下，人民的希望是不可能实现的。这是一个更明显的证明。
    今天我们治淮的目标是非常明确的，首先是为了淮河流域五千五百万广大农民迫切的要求，同时也完全符合整个国家建设的需要。就我国的人口来说，农业人口占着最大的比重，所以我们一贯地把直接关系农民利益的水利工作，放在十分重要的地位上。我们新民主主义的经济和资本主义国家的经济之间的重要区别之一，就是资本主义的工业的繁荣，是在农民被剥削、被压榨、贫困、破产的基础上建立起来的，而新民主主义经济发展的道路，则是首先着重农业生产的恢复和发展，扩大国内市场，以刺激工业的普遍发展，由于工业的发展，又反转来提高了农业的生产。因为我们的工农之间的关系，在经济上和在政治上，是走着互助的道路，将来到共产主义时代，则要根本消灭城市和农村的区别。所以我们在建国伊始，就着手筹划对全国各大河流都进行根本的治理，以满足农业生产的需要。一九五○年淮河发生水灾以后，虽然我们国内经济还有困难，英明的中央人民政府就决定立刻开始淮河的根治工程，并且要求在第一年度就基本免除巨大的洪水灾害。这不但是淮河流域人民朝思暮想的希望，同时也正符合国家整个经济发展的需要。
    治淮是依靠人民
    治淮是依靠谁？这也是我们和过去的反动统治阶级在水利工作上另一个根本的区别。过去反动统治阶级的治水的工作，因为是为了少数统治阶级的利益，所以他们的工程是依靠封建地主，是依靠腐朽的官僚机构，是依靠帝国主义国家的技术和生产。我们的治淮工程，因为是为了人民的利益，所以我们的工程是依靠广大的群众力量，是依靠有高度的为人民服务思想的行政和技术干部，是依靠自己的技术和生产能力，并学习社会主义国家的先进经验。
    这一个基本区别，使我们的治淮工程，和反动统治时期的水利工作在工程计划、工程实施、工程经费和工作效率上都表现着原则性的不同。因为反动统治时代的工程是依靠封建地主、腐朽的官僚资产阶级和帝国主义，所以他们的工程计划充满着脱离实际的错误的调查资料和工程设计。由于地主阶级和官僚资产阶级的自私的特征，有些工程并且是严重存在着“以邻为壑”的思想，造成地方与地方间无尽的纠纷。他们的工程实施，只能采取徭役劳动或者雇佣劳动的方式，只要有工程的地方，就存在着大量的贪污和剥削，大小工程都有“偷工减料”的事实，谈不到安全与经济。工人们是在被剥削、被奴役、被鞭打的情况下从事劳动，自然更不会积极地改进工作方法，提高工作效率。因为一切技术性较高的工程，都是依靠帝国主义国家的技术和生产，而帝国主义国家对殖民地的态度，根本是限制殖民地工业的发展，来维持它自己的剥削地位，因此它对殖民地不可能进行真正帮助，即便帮助举办一些工程，也是为了更便利于掠夺殖民地国家的原料，大量剥削殖民地国家劳动人民的剩余价值，以及为帝国主义的钢铁、水泥、木材的生产寻找销场，所以工程愈大，就愈增加我国对帝国主义国家的半殖民地性质的依存关系。
    和这样情况恰好相反，因为我们的治淮工程是依靠沿淮五千五百万人民和全国人民自觉的努力，所以我们的工程计划全面地综合了淮河流域全体人民的意志和要求。通过群众的帮助，我们校正了各种查勘资料的错误，使我们的工程设计，能够切合实际。我们的工程的实施，不是采取徭役或雇佣劳动的方法。我们通过广大的政治动员和群众运动，通过民主的组织形式，使二百二十万民工真正成为工程的主人，因之工作效率就大为提高。在广大群众把治淮当自己的事情的情况下，依靠群众的创造发明，我们解决了在冰天雪地取土的问题，解决了砂礓石和水中取土的问题，使许多旧式工具发挥了最高的效能，同时也学习了使用现代化工具的技术。我们在九个月内做了二亿立方公尺的土工，在一百天内完成了巨大的润河集分水闸工程。石漫滩水库工程只用了不到半年的时间。这在任何反动政权下都是不可想像的事情。由于我们对技术性很高的水库闸坝工程，都是依靠自己的技术和生产，因而我们每一个工程的完成，反过来又提高了自己在生产技术上的水平，因而不断增加了工作的信心。
    工人阶级对治淮工程的领导
    以上所说是治淮工程的两个主要的特征，我们所以能够在全部工程中实现这两个主要的特征，则是由于有了工人阶级在思想上、政治上、组织上和技术上的领导作用。我们的国家是人民民主主义的国家，我们的一切事业都深入地贯彻着工人阶级的领导（经过共产党）。至于其在治淮工程中的具体表现，则主要地表现在以下的几个方面。
    第一，是表现在中央和地方人民政府对整个治淮计划的思想领导上。过去治淮工程的所以不能解决淮河的问题，除去其他原因以外，有一个普遍的原因，就是对这条河流的治理，完全从局部的观点出发，支离割裂地进行治理，徒然造成上中下游的矛盾冲突，而不能解决任何的问题。这种情况是我国封建土地制度在水利事业上的具体反映。我们现在的治淮工程，则恰恰与此相反。从规划到施工，处处贯彻着整体的观点。在工程的规划上，首先提出通盘规划，蓄泄兼筹的方针。在工程的设计施工上，处处强调上中下游统筹兼顾。贯穿着局部服从整体，小利服从大利的原则。而这一切却正是工人阶级所独具的伟大思想。正是这种工人阶级的整体观点和全局思想，使我们在治淮工程中彻底清除了地方主义的毒害。地方与地方间种种利害矛盾，在统一规划下得到圆满的解决，因而使治淮工程计划成为一个最经济最合理的计划。
    第二，是表现在先进的生产技术对工程的作用上。前面说过通盘规划蓄泄兼筹是治淮工程的突出的特点，可是这通盘规划、蓄泄兼筹的方针，却是必须在先进的生产技术的基础上才能产生出来的。只有在中国工人阶级掌握了现代化的制造工业和建筑技术的条件下，我们才可能设想依靠自己力量修筑这样多的水库工程和润河集分水闸这样巨大的控制工程，以拦蓄水流，利用水流，变水害为水利。假如中国工人阶级现在没有这样的先进的生产技术，我们就不能不仍然停滞在被动的防御的阶段，不可能在现在达到“用水兴利”的理想。
    第三，是表现在对广大农民群众的组织和教育上。治淮工程主要是依靠广大的农民的力量，但是必须学习工人阶级的先进的组织性，农民的力量才充分发挥。在这次治淮工程中和庞大的运输工作上所表现的高度的组织性，土方工程上所表现的一个高潮接着一个高潮的竞赛运动，都不是小生产者固有的作风，而是集体主义精神的高度表现。在“天下农民是一家”的口号下，各地民工充满着互助友爱。为了解决治淮与农业生产的矛盾，多数地区普遍进行了前后方（治淮是前方，农业生产是后方）的互助组织。为了建筑水库必须迁移一部分群众，农民的习惯本来是“安土重迁”的，可是在“一户搬家，千户发家。一户搬家，千户安插。”的号召下，水库区域的农民都愉快地迁移到新的地区，并且受到了当地群众热烈的欢迎和照顾。这一切都表示广大的农民是接受了工人阶级的先进的思想和组织教育的。
    第四，是表现在工人阶级对治淮工程的直接支援上。在润河集分水闸工程中，为了生产装置工程所需要的机械和钢材，上海一百余家工厂的工人，昼夜工作，坚持几个月的时间。为了使各种机械设备的精密度和耐久性，完全符合工程要求的标准，在设计制造上，他们不惜三番五次的研究修改，并且派遣自己最优秀的代表，亲到工地，协助进行装置和试验工作。这表示在工农联盟的国家里，工人阶级对农民弟兄伟大的关切和具体的帮助。这在反动统治时代的中国和资本主义国家内是绝对做不到的事情。
    为争取更大成绩而奋斗
    我们今年所做的工程，只是治淮计划的第一期工程。今年的成绩虽然很大，可是在进行的过程中，在个别问题上，我们也走过错误的弯曲的道路。我们所以能够获得这样的成绩，是因为我们在中央人民政府和毛主席领导下在苏联的先进经验帮助下，初步掌握了以上的三个特点，我们之所以还犯有个别的错误，则是我们还没有完全地彻底地实现了这三个特点。现在治淮的第二期工程就要开始了，一九五二年的工程是比一九五一年更巨大更艰难的任务。同志们，我们要提高我们思想和技术水平，我们要加强我们的组织领导，不要骄傲自满，在胜利的基础上，继续前进！
