Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 5)

Fifth Section: Playing with Words

Playing with words is a very common and serious problem. People are unwilling to express a sentence directly and simply, but always like to pile up many new words and decorate it into a seven-treasure pavilion, making people feel dazzled and bewildered. The author's true intention is obscured. If this trend continues, on the one hand, the simplicity and purity of our language will be greatly damaged; on the other hand, these new words will inevitably lose their original accuracy and precision due to their too frequent and excessive use, and may become meaningless.

New things should be expressed with fresh words, and there is no reason to oppose the use of "new terms." But it should be used in appropriate places, not abused or misused.

Examples of abuse. Abuse is using words unnecessarily. Some words in the following example sentences can be deleted:

(1) In the past few days, the entrance of the library has shown unprecedented crowding. (Writing)
(2) Under the extremely difficult printing conditions in the liberated areas... (Periodical)
(3) The team committee's leadership over the work team is not thorough and comprehensive enough. (Periodical)
(4) But the problem is that they have gone crazy, so it is difficult to predict with common sense. (Periodical)
(5) Speaking of my marriage problem, the route I have gone through is complicated. (Letter)
(6) When she learned that the trade union had decided to send her to study, she was greatly moved in her heart. (Periodical)
(7) The result is white spots on the eyes, bulging eyeballs, and ulcers may occur when the symptoms are serious. (Book)
(8) Through these lectures, the technical level of workers has been further improved. (Newspaper)
(9) In the minds of students, the attitude towards Chinese language has developed from neglect and indifference to actively demanding improvement in teaching and improvement of teaching effectiveness. (Newspaper)
(10) Because farmers have been oppressed by the feudal system for a long time, they must also have many concerns in their minds, fearing retaliation from landlords and dare not stand up. (Periodical)
(11) In the great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our country, women were the first to show great enthusiasm. (Periodical)
(12) So, on what basis did Shanghai's industry develop and gradually move towards improvement? (Periodical)
(13) He and Yucheng embarked on the road to study at the military academy with an increasingly enhanced determination to defend the glorious motherland. (Newspaper)
(14) We must continue the war to resist America until we stop the American imperialist aggression, in exchange for more favorable conditions and time for our people from all walks of life to create more and greater freedom and happiness. (Periodical)
(15) However, transformation has different timeliness for each person, because each person has his own environment, and this environment, under the direct influence of objective conditions, affects the order and speed of transformation. (Writing)

(1) "Show" is unnecessary; saying "the entrance of the library is unprecedentedly crowded" is simple and clear. (2) "Conditions" is unnecessary and should be deleted. (3) "Grasp" is unnecessary, and the original sentence is incomprehensible. It is better to say "not thorough enough, not comprehensive enough." (4) "The problem is" is unnecessary, and it should be changed to "Since they have gone crazy." (5) "Problem" and "route" are unnecessary. Just say "Speaking of my marriage, the process is very complicated." (6) "In the heart" and "received" are unnecessary. Change to "very moved." (7) Just say "will ulcerate." (8) Since it has improved, it is naturally a step further, and "further" should be deleted. (The "了" in "通过了" should also be deleted.) (9) "In the minds of" is unnecessary. "Development" is inappropriate. It should be changed to "Students... have changed from... to...", and "的地步" should be deleted. (10) "In thought" is unnecessary and should be deleted. (11) It is not known to whom "first" is compared. Here it refers to women, so it should be compared to men, but in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, men, women, old and young are equally active, and there is no distinction between first and last. "First" is redundant. (12) Too cumbersome. Why not say "… and gradually get better"? (13) Why not say "entered the military cadre school"? (14) "In exchange for...time" is unnecessary, and the meaning is not clear. It should be deleted, and the whole sentence can be changed to "...until the American imperialists stop the aggression, and we can let go and create a happier life." (15) After talking for a long time, it is just one sentence: "Each person's environment is different, so the speed of transformation is also different."

(16) We are born in this great new democratic era, have such a great and lovable motherland, and have the great Communist Party of China and the great people's leader Chairman Mao leading us. We have the responsibility and possibility to complete our great mission. (Speech)
(17) Great "People's Garden" editors. (Letter)

As far as (16) is concerned, the era is indeed great, the motherland is indeed great, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are indeed great, and our mission is indeed great - but, is it not afraid to damage the inherent power of this adjective by using it one after another like this? (17) "Great" even reached the editors of the People's Garden. We think that the editors of "People's Garden" must say "I dare not, I dare not."

Examples of misuse. Misuse is using words inappropriately. The following example sentences can be changed to ordinary words:

(18) But without long-term plans is his consistent ideological consciousness. (Periodical)
(19) His awareness of the new society is not clear. (Writing)
(20) I have no feelings for my wife at all. (Letter)
(21) Now the fishermen have elected their own administrative team leader (fisherman Wang Changfu) to be responsible for mastering the management of the fishermen's lives and production. (Periodical)
(22) The process of these seventeen evil landlords being beaten to death took place continuously for five days. (Periodical)
(23) Librarians should not only play a management role, but also play an organizational and leadership role, frequently contact readers, understand readers' needs, establish a reader network, and hold regular reader contact meetings. (Periodical)

(18) Change to "But he never makes long-term plans." (19) Change to "He is not clear about his understanding of the new society." (20) Change to "I have no feelings for my wife at all." (21) Change "mastering" to "managing," and remove the following "of management." (22) "Process" does not "happen," let alone "continuously happen." Why not say "These seventeen evil landlords were beaten to death in five days"? (Also, if there is a numeral in front, you cannot add "们" at the end). (23) Like all other language formats, "play a...role" is not omnipotent. There are only a limited number of verbs that can be inserted into "play a...role," such as "play a leading role" and "play a leadership role." We never say "teachers play a teaching role," "secretaries play a copying role," "librarians play a management role," etc. This sentence should be changed to "Librarians should not only manage books, but also frequently contact readers...contact meetings and play an organizational and leadership role among them."

(24) In the provinces that have undergone key pilot projects for land reform and the areas that have recently completed land reform, due to the adherence to the policy of mobilizing both male and female peasants together in the land reform, and on the basis of male and female peasants jointly obtaining a share of land, women's awareness has been unprecedentedly improved. (Periodical)
(25) Although there are these advantages, there are also shortcomings on the basis of these advantages. (Book)
(26) Good health is inseparable from a good appetite. (Writing)
(27) There is a reason why Jilin paddy fields can recover so quickly in terms of area and output. In addition to the government's continuous investment of huge funds to support rewards and planned leadership, it is inseparable from the following reasons. (Manuscript)

The "basis" in (24) and (25) are both used inappropriately. (24) "Due to...policy" and "male and female peasants jointly obtaining a share of land" are two reasons for "the unprecedented improvement in women's awareness," but the phrase "on the basis of..." cannot be used to indicate a reason, so it is confusing to read. In addition, the meaning of "male and female peasants jointly obtaining a share of land" is also ambiguous. It should be changed to "Due to...policy, and when distributing land, male and female peasants have equal rights, so women's awareness has been unprecedentedly improved." (25) Why not just say "but there are also some shortcomings"? (26) One of the uses of "inseparable" is to express the causal relationship between two things. But sometimes it is impossible to distinguish which is the cause and which is the effect. For example, in this sentence, is good health the reason for a good appetite? Or is a good appetite the reason for good health? Or are they mutually causal? In this case, it is best not to use "inseparable" to avoid causing misunderstanding. (27) Since "reason" is used, there is no need to use "inseparable" again. It should be changed to "There are also the following reasons."

(28) After these two mobilizations, their class consciousness and production enthusiasm have been improved. (Periodical)
(29) Recently, Japanese workers have shown a rapid increase in awareness. (Periodical)
(30) According to the typical reports from Shandong and other regions, it is pointed out that the labor force has significantly decreased compared to before the Anti-Japanese War. (Periodical)

Unnecessarily turning verbs into nouns is not only verbose but also useless. (28) Change to "...have all improved." (29) Change to "...the awareness of workers has rapidly improved." (30) Change to "...significantly reduced compared to before the Anti-Japanese War."

(31) Grade B housing has always been insufficient...and the phenomenon of marriage among Grade B personnel is developing universally. (Periodical)

Instead of saying "more and more people are getting married," we must use words such as "phenomenon," "universal," and "development" to make a very ordinary sentence very abstract and profound. What is the point of this? This kind of deliberately profound "phenomenon" is indeed "developing universally." It is everyone's responsibility to correct this tendency.

Incomprehensible examples. Playing with words to a certain extent will make people unable to understand. Some can be barely guessed, for example:

(32) Under this circumstance, a large difference in level occurred in the school. (Writing)
(33) The author's character lacks the minimum sense of responsibility and honor and disgrace towards justice. (Newspaper)
(34) He is indeed different from before. I should not look at people with a historical perspective. (Writing)

(32) The author means "...the phenomenon of great differences in academic performance among students occurred." (33) "Sense of honor and disgrace" is incomprehensible. It is probably saying "...lacks the minimum sense of responsibility and justice." (34) It means "should not look at people with a static perspective."

The following examples are difficult to guess the author's meaning:

(35) When eating dumplings, four international friends showed a very sincere and simple attitude. (Periodical)
(36) The production competition movement combined with the reward system is an important cyclical factor for improving production quality and becomes a mutual lever. (Manuscript)
(37) Our county is a land reform area this winter and next spring. In order not to hinder and try to reconcile the development of mutually conflicting combined movements to carry out work, the County Water Conservancy Committee has made a concrete plan on the steps of water conservancy construction. (Manuscript)

(35) "Simple attitude" is incomprehensible. Using "sincere" and "simple" in eating dumplings is especially incomprehensible. (36) What is a "cyclical factor"? What is a "mutual lever"? (37) The second clause piles up a lot of new words that are not related to each other, which is really incomprehensible.

There are many incomprehensible examples. We will talk about them in section six.

    语法、修辞讲话（第五讲）
    吕叔湘  朱德熙
    第五段  耍字眼
    耍字眼是很普遍而且很严重的毛病。一句话不肯直捷了当地说出来，总欢喜堆砌许多新词语，装点成一座七宝楼台，让人看了，只觉得眼花撩乱，扑朔迷离，作者的真意反而隐晦不显。这种风气继续下去，一方面我们的语言的朴素和纯洁将受到很大的损害；另一方面，这些新词语，由于用得太频繁，太滥，也必然会失去原有的准确性与精密性，很可能变得毫无内容。
    新鲜事物应该用新鲜词语来表达，没有理由反对用“新名词”。但是应该用在适当的地方，不要滥用，不要乱用。
    滥用的例子。  滥用是不必用而用。下面的例句里有些词语是可以删去的：
    （一）这几天来，图书馆门口呈现着空前的拥挤。（作）
    （二）在解放区制版条件极困难的情形下……。（期）
    （三）队委会对工作队的领导，深入掌握全面不够。（期）
    （四）但，问题在于他们已经疯狂了，那就难以常理推测了。（期）
    （五）讲起我的婚姻问题，所经过的路线是复杂的。（信）
    （六）当她知道工会决定要她去学习之后，她内心里受到了极大的感动。（期）
    （七）结果是眼睛上有白翳，眼球凸出，病症严重的时候，会有溃烂的情况发生。（书）
    （八）通过了这些讲座，进一步提高了工人的技术水平。（报）
    （九）在同学的思想中，对于语文已经从轻视、漠不关心而发展到积极要求改进教学和提高教学效果的地步了。（报）
    （十）农民因长期在封建制度压榨之下，在思想上也必然顾虑重重，深怕地主报复而不敢出头。（期）
    （十一）在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动中，妇女首先表现得很积极。（期）
    （十二）那末，上海工业是在怎样的基础上发展起来而逐渐向着好转之途迈进的呢？（期）
    （十三）他和玉成带着愈益增强了的保卫光荣祖国的决心，踏上了进军干学校学习的路途。（报）
    （十四）还要继续进行抗美战争，直到制止美帝侵略，以换取我各界人民获得更有利的条件和时间，来创造更多更大的自由幸福。（期）
    （十五）然而改造对于每一个人有不同的时间性，因为每一个人有他一个环境，这一环境由于客观条件的直接影响下，影响改造的先后及快慢。（作）（一）“呈现”不必要；说“图书馆门口空前拥挤”，又简单，又清楚。（二）“条件”不必要，应删。（三）“掌握”不必要，而且原句也费解，不如说“不够深入，不够全面”。（四）“问题在于”不必要，改做“他们既然疯狂了”。（五）“问题”和“路线”都不必要，只要说“讲起我的婚姻，经过是很复杂的”就是了。（六）“内心”“受到”都不必要，改做“非常感动”。（七）只要说“会溃烂”。（八）既然提高了，自然是进了一步，“进一步”应删。（“通过了”的“了”字也应删。）（九）“在思想中”不必要。“发展”不妥。应改为“同学对于……已经从……转变为……”，“的地步”删去。（十）“在思想上”不必要，应删。（十一）“首先”不知道是跟谁比较，这里说的是妇女，那么该是跟男子比较，但是在抗美援朝运动中，男女老幼都一样积极，分不出先后。“首先”是多余的。（十二）太累赘，何不说“……而逐渐好转的呢”？（十三）何不说“进了军事干部学校”？（十四）“以换取……时间”不必要，而且意思也不清楚，应删去，全句可以改做“……直到美帝停止侵略，我们能放手创造更幸福的生活”。（十五）说了半天，只是一句话：“各人的环境不同，所以改造的快慢也不同”。
    （十六）我们生在这个伟大的新民主主义的时代，有这样的伟大的可爱的祖国，有伟大的中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛主席领导我们，我们是有责任并且有可能完成我们的伟大的任务的。（演说）
    （十七）伟大的“人民园地”编辑同志。（信）
    以（十六）而论，时代确实是伟大的，祖国也确实是伟大的，共产党和毛主席也确实是伟大的，我们的任务也确实是伟大的——但是，这样接二连三地用，不怕损害这个形容词的固有的力量吗？（十七）索性“伟大”到了人民园地的编辑同志的头上了。我们想，“人民园地”的编辑同志一定说“不敢当，不敢当。”
    乱用的例子。  乱用是用得不恰当。下面的例句都可以改用寻常话来说：
    （十八）但没有长期打算，是他的一贯思想意识。（期）
    （十九）他对新社会的意识并不明了。（作）
    （二十）我对我妻子一点感情不存在。（信）
    （二一）现在渔民们自己选出了行政组长（渔民王长府），负责掌握渔民的生活与生产的管理。（期）
    （二二）这十七个恶霸地主们被打死的过程，是在五天里连续不断发生的。（期）
    （二三）图书管理员不应只是起管理作用，还应该起组织领导作用，经常联系读者，了解读者要求，建立读者网，定期召集读者联系会。（期）（十八）改做“但他向来不做长期打算”。（十九）改做“他对新社会认识不清楚”。（二十）改做“我跟我的妻子一点感情也没有”。（二一）把“掌握”改成“管理”，下面的“的管理”取消。（二二）“过程”不会“发生”，更不能“连续不断发生”。为什么不说“这十七个恶霸地主是在五天里被打死的”？（又，前面有数词，后面就不能再加“们”）。（二三）跟所有别的语言格式一样，“起……作用”也不是万能的，能够插在“起……作用”里的动词只是有限的几个，譬如“起带头作用”“起领导作用”，我们从来不说“教员起教书作用”“书记起抄写作用”“图书管理员起管理作用”等等。这一句话应改做“图书管理员不应只管理图书，还应该经常联系读者……联系会，在他们中间起组织与领导的作用”。
    （二四）在本省经过土改重点试验及新近完成土改的地区，由于在土改中坚持了男女农民一齐发动的方针，及在男女农民共同分得一份土地的基础上，妇女觉悟空前提高。（期）
    （二五）虽然有着这些优点，但是在这优点的基础上也有不够的地方。（书）
    （二六）身体健康是和胃口好分不开的。（作）
    （二七）吉林水田，面积与产量上，所以能恢复这样快，并不是没有原因的，这里除政府连年投下巨大资金扶助奖励与有计划的领导外，是与下边的几个原因分不开的。（稿）（二四）（二五）的“基础”都用得不恰当。（二四）“由于……方针”跟“男女农民共同分得一份土地”是“妇女觉悟空前提高”的两个原因，但是“在……基础上”这个短语不能用来表示原因，因此读起来就让人觉得莫名其妙了。此外，“男女农民共同分得一份土地”的意思也很含混，应改做“由于……方针，而且在分配土地的时候，男女农民有同等的权利，所以妇女觉悟空前提高”。（二五）何不直捷了当地说“但是也有一些缺点”？（二六）“分不开”的用处之一是表示两件事情的因果关系。但是有时候分不出哪一个是因，哪一个是果，例如本句，身体健康是胃口好的原因？还是胃口好是身体健康的原因？还是互为因果？在这种场合，最好不要用“分不开”，避免引起误会。（二七）既然用了“原因”，就不必再用“分不开”，应改做“还有下面几个原因”。
    （二八）经过这两次动员，他们的阶级觉悟和生产热情都得到提高。（期）
    （二九）最近日本工人更表现了觉悟的迅速提高。（期）
    （三十）又根据山东等区的典型报告，指出劳动力较抗战前有显著的减少。（期）不必要地把动词转成名词用，除了啰嗦之外，毫无好处。（二八）改做“……都提高了”。（二九）改做“……工人的觉悟迅速提高了”。（三十）改做“……较抗战前显著减少”。
    （三一）乙级住宅一向不够分配……而乙级人员的结婚现象却正在普遍地发展着。（期）
    不说“结婚的越来越多”，一定要用“现象”“普遍”“发展”等等词汇，把一句很普通的话，弄得非常抽象，非常高深，这是何苦来呢？这类故作高深的“现象”的确在“普遍地发展着”，纠正这种偏向是大家的责任。
    费解的例子。   耍字眼耍到某种程度，就会让人看不懂。有些还可以勉强猜得出来，例如：
    （三二）在这种情况之下，在学校里就产生了程度相差很大的距离。（作）
    （三三）作者笔下的这种人物，缺乏最低限度的责任心与对正义的荣辱感。（报）
    （三四）他的确和以前两样了，我不应该用历史的眼光去看人。（作）（三二）作者的意思是说“……就产生了同学之间成绩相差很大的现象”。（三三）“荣辱感”不可解，恐怕是说“……缺乏最低限度的责任心与正义感”。（三四）是说“不应该以一成不变的眼光去看人”。
    下面这些例子就到了难于猜测作者的意思：
    （三五）吃饺子时候，四个国际朋友显出非常诚恳朴素的态度。（期）
    （三六）生产竞赛运动结合奖励制度，对生产质量的提高是重要的循环因素，成为相互间的杠杆。（稿）
    （三七）我县在今冬明春是土改地区，为了不妨碍和尽量调和相互冲突结合运动的发展情况下去进行工作，在兴修水利步骤上县修委会已作出了具体计划。（稿）（三五）“朴素的态度”费解，把“诚恳”“朴素”用在吃饺子上尤其费解。（三六）什么叫“循环因素”？什么叫“相互间的杠杆”？（三七）第二个分句堆砌了一大串新词语，彼此不相关联，真是叫人莫名其妙。
    费解的例子极多，我们留在第六段里再谈。
                                        （本段完，全文未完）
