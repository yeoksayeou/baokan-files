Over the past year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has united the broad masses of youth and played a significant role in the national Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement.

Over the past year, tens of thousands of Youth League members and young people have joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting bravely on the Korean front, displaying a high degree of revolutionary heroism, and setting a brilliant example for the younger generation of the motherland. For example, Youth League member Teng Kai, well-known to the youth of the country, sacrificed himself to blow up a bridge; Ma Jiashun firmly defended Wenheng Mountain, and finally pulled the pin on a grenade and died with the enemy; Cao Baoheng, a bugler of a certain unit, was seriously wounded by a shell in the Battle of Yunshan, but he still insisted on performing his duties, lying on the ground and blowing the bugle to maintain contact, blowing it again and again until his last sacrifice, still tightly holding the bugle. Nineteen-year-old League member Zeng Nansheng, in the battle in the Hongchuan area, fought with another soldier against dozens of times their number of enemies, cleverly and bravely delaying the enemy and depleting their forces, completing the defense mission, and winning the title of "Youth Hero." League member Cao Zhigao defended his position alone for five days and five nights, repelling three enemy assaults, and finally found his own team; his comrades asked him how he had spent the past few days, and he said, "I only remembered that I am a Youth League member and must resolutely complete the task." Similarly, among the young drivers, railway workers, cultural instructors, nurses, and members of cultural troupes on the Korean front, countless exemplary figures have emerged. Many League members have performed meritorious service and have been awarded military medals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These outstanding performances of Youth League members and young soldiers are inseparable from the education of the Communist Party. Many outstanding Youth League members, before sacrificing themselves, resolutely asked their superiors to approve them as Communist Party members.

In factories, League members and young people actively participated in patriotic labor competitions, striving to strengthen the economic power for Resist-America, Aid-Korea. A large number of League members have become labor heroes and models for creating new records. The youth advanced production team in Lushun City, led by Liu Lifu, had, by August of this year, overfulfilled its tasks by 533% in the past twenty months, and guaranteed that 100% of its products were of superior quality. Hao Jianxiu, a seventeen-year-old female worker and League member at Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 6, created a set of scientific fine yarn working methods. The Hao Jianxiu working method has been studied in yarn mills across the country, and more League members and young workers are creating even better records. On the railways, the No. 1008 locomotive, with a youth-contracted team headed by League member Qiao Yuyan, continued to develop the "500-day kilometer movement" initiated by them in their section, creating a national driving record of 1,113.4 kilometers in a single day and night. League members and young workers bravely protected factories, preventing the sabotage plots of counter-revolutionary elements. In the Northeast, emerged factory-protecting heroes, League member Zhu Wenxiu and young technician Wang Tonglun. They fought against special agents at the risk of their lives. League members and young workers also participated in volunteer work teams to Korea and applied to military cadre schools. Among railway workers alone, 3,440 League members and 2,671 young people participated in volunteer aid-Korea transportation teams in the past year.

Young peasants put forward the slogan "Grow one more grain of rice, add one more point of strength to Resist-America, Aid-Korea" in the patriotic production movement. In Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, hundreds of "small farms" were run mainly by League members, actively researching and improving production techniques. In sixty-six counties in Hebei, Pingyuan, and other regions, more than 24,000 League members led more than 38,000 peasants to participate in mutual aid teams. League members played an important role in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda work in rural areas. For example, in Heilongjiang Province alone, 28,000 League members participated in propaganda work. Inspired by the enthusiasm for defending the motherland and defending their homes, young peasants actively signed up to join the Volunteer Army, and the number greatly exceeded the original quota. In the great water conservancy project areas, young people in rural areas actively participated in the construction of water conservancy projects. Forty percent of the League members in the Huai River area participated in river work, and female League members Gan Caihua and Jin Xiulan were selected as special models for the Huai River project.

Over the past year, students, under the education of patriotism, have studied hard, preparing to serve the motherland, and actively carried out the movement to eliminate the influence of American cultural aggression, participated in Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda work and other rear work. They enthusiastically responded to the call of the motherland. In the two rounds of enrollment by the military cadre schools of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Youth League members took the lead in participating. League members accounted for nearly one-half of the students admitted to military cadre schools, injecting new blood into the national defense forces of the motherland.

Youth League members in other various work posts also made various exemplary deeds. For example, Shi Ruifen, a female teacher and Youth League member in Southern Jiangsu, relied on the masses and ran schools with revolutionary spirit and methods, demonstrating the noble qualities of a people's teacher. In the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, in the movement to inspect and revise patriotic pacts, donate planes and cannons, and oppose the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan, Youth League organizations in various places actively united the broad masses of youth and completed the tasks put forward by the Communist Party and the People's Government. Over the past year, the Youth League, in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, has proved with its concrete actions that it is a loyal and powerful assistant to the Communist Party and the People's Government.

    全国青年团员和青年一年来在抗美援朝运动中的贡献
    一年来，中国新民主主义青年团在中国共产党的领导下团结广大青年，在全国人民的抗美援朝运动中，起了重大的作用。
    一年以来成千成万的青年团员和青年们参加了中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜前线英勇战斗，发挥了高度的革命英雄主义的精神，为祖国这代青年树立了光辉的榜样。如为全国青年所熟知的青年团员滕凯舍身炸大桥；马家顺坚守文衡山，最后拉开手榴弹与敌人同归于尽，某部司号员曹保恒，在云山战斗中被炮弹击中重伤，仍坚持执行职务，卧在地上吹号联络，一次又一次地吹，直到最后牺牲，还紧握号角不放。十九岁的团员曾南生，在洪川地区的战斗中，和另一战士与数十倍的敌人战斗，机智勇敢地迟滞敌人，消耗敌人兵力，完成守备任务，获得了“青年英雄”的称号。团员曹志高，一人坚守阵地五天五夜，打退敌人三次冲锋，最后找到自己队伍；战友问他几天怎么过的，他说：“我只记着我是青年团员，要坚决完成任务。”同样地，在朝鲜前线的青年司机、铁路工人、文化教员、护理员、文工团员……中，也涌现了无数的模范人物。许多团员立了功，并荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国颁发的军功勋章。青年团员和青年战士们这些卓越的表现，是和共产党的教育分不开的，许多优秀的青年团员在牺牲前，坚决要上级批准他们为共产党员。
    在工厂中的团员和青年积极参加爱国劳动竞赛，努力加强抗美援朝的经济力量。大批团员成为劳动英雄和创造新纪录的模范。旅大市以刘立富为首的青年先进生产小组，到今年八月为止，二十个月来，超额完成任务百分之五百三十三，并保证产品质量百分之百的优等。青岛国棉六厂十七岁的女工、团员郝建秀，创造了一套科学的细纱工作法。全国纱厂已在学习郝建秀工作法，更多的团员和青年工人创造着更优秀的纪录。在铁道上，一○○八号机车以团员乔玉岩为首的青年包车组，继续发展他们在本段上发起的“五百日车公里运动”，创造了一昼夜行走一千一百一十三·四公里的全国行车纪录。团员和青年工人们英勇护厂，防止反革命分子的阴谋破坏。在东北出现了护厂功臣、团员祝文秀和青年技工王同伦。他们不顾生命危险，和特务搏斗。团员和青年工人还参加了志愿赴朝工作队和报名投考军事干部学校。单在铁路工人中，一年来即有三千四百四十名团员和二千六百七十一名青年参加了志愿援朝运输队。
    青年农民在爱国生产运动中提出了“多打一粒粮食，多增加一分抗美援朝的力量”的口号。平原省安阳专区以团员为主，办了数百个“小农场”，积极研究改进生产技术。河北、平原等地区六十六个县中，二万四千余团员带动了三万八千农民参加了互助组。在农村的抗美援朝宣传工作中，团员起着重要作用，如黑龙江一省即有二万八千名团员参加宣传工作。在保卫祖国保卫家乡的热情鼓舞下，青年农民纷纷报名参加志愿军，数字大大超过原订名额。在伟大的水利工程地区，农村青年又纷纷参加修建水利工作，沿淮地区百分之四十的团员参加河工，女团员甘彩华、金秀兰被选为治淮特等模范。
    学生们一年来，在爱国主义的教育下，努力学习，准备为祖国服务，并积极进行了肃清美国文化侵略影响的运动，参加了抗美援朝的宣传工作及其他后方工作。他们踊跃响应祖国号召。人民革命军事委员会各军事干部学校两次招生，青年团员都带头参加，在军事干部学校录取的学生中，团员几占二分之一，他们为祖国的国防力量注入了新的血液。
    在其他各个工作岗位上的青年团员，也作出各种模范事迹，如苏南女教师青年团员史瑞芬，依靠群众，以革命精神及方法办学，表现了人民教师的高贵品质。在抗美援朝运动中，在检查与修订爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和反对美国单独对日媾和的运动中，各地青年团组织都积极团结广大青年，完成了共产党和人民政府所提出的任务。一年来，青年团在抗美援朝运动中，以自己的具体行动，证明它是共产党和人民政府的忠实和有力的助手。
