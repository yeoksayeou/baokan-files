    Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Tehran, 8th. Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh has decided to lead the Iranian delegation to attend the United Nations Security Council's discussion on the Iranian oil issue. According to a TASS dispatch from Tehran: Prime Minister Mossadegh reported to the Iranian Lower House on the 4th regarding his trip to New York, saying: "When we joined the United Nations Organization and signed the United Nations Charter, we held great hope and trust. Now it can be tested whether the United Nations is the foundation of international peace, cooperation, and justice, or a trap set for small countries. We will see whether the principles enshrined in Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter are immutable international laws, or just a pile of waste paper. Article 2, Paragraph 7 stipulates that the Security Council has no right to intervene in matters that fall within the national sovereignty of each country."

    摩萨台决出席安理会讨论伊朗石油问题
    【新华社八日讯】伊朗首相摩萨台决定率领伊朗代表团出席联合国安全理事会关于伊朗石油问题的讨论。据塔斯社德黑兰消息：摩萨台首相四日向伊朗下院报告他这次纽约之行时说：“我们参加联合国组织，而且在联合国宪章上签字的时候，是抱着很大的希望和信赖的。现在可以考验，联合国究竟是国际和平、合作和正义的基础，还是为小国所设的陷阱。我们将会看到，联合国宪章第二条第七款所载的原则究竟是不变的国际法律，还是仅仅是一堆废纸，第二条第七款规定安全理事会无权干涉属于各国国家主权的事情。”
