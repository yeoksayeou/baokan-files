Comrade Chairman Peng Zhen, Members, Comrades:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's political report. Now, on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I will report on the situation of the national movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country over the past year and the work for the future.

(I)

The Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, calculated from October 25th of last year when the Chinese People's Volunteers went abroad to fight, has been going on for a year. This struggle is another great struggle against imperialist aggression waged by the Chinese people after winning the victory in the Liberation War and driving the American aggressive forces out of mainland China.

Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at our meeting: "We do not want to invade any country, we only oppose the imperialists' aggression against our country. Everyone understands that if the American army had not occupied our Taiwan, invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and attacked our northeastern border, the Chinese people would not have fought the American army. But since the American aggressors have attacked us, we have no choice but to raise the banner of anti-aggression. This is completely necessary and completely just, and the people of the whole country have understood this necessity and justice."

Over the past year, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, fighting bravely on the Korean front, have achieved great victories. From October 25th of last year to October 10th of this year, our People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have killed, wounded, and captured more than 387,000 enemy troops, including more than 176,000 American troops; shot down, damaged, and captured 2,310 enemy aircraft, and seized countless other enemy weapons. The American aggressors and their accomplices and puppet troops have been forced to return to the starting point of their aggression, near the 38th parallel, because they have suffered heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean people's forces.

The victory in the anti-aggression war in Korea proves that American imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, fragile, and essentially just a "paper tiger," and its aggression can be defeated.

First, our victory has caused American imperialism to suffer unusual and ever-increasing losses in Korea. The total number of American troops annihilated has now exceeded 170,000, that is to say, in less than a year, the total number of American troops annihilated has been equivalent to three times the total number of American casualties in the first year of the Pacific War. The number of enemy troops lost each month was 21,258 in the three months from October 25th of last year; an average of 31,290 in the fourth to seventh months; an average of 40,693 in the eighth to eleventh months; and in the half month from September 25th to October 10th, the enemy's losses reached 30,703, which is 2.9 times the average of the first three months. The ratio of enemy to our casualties has risen to about two to one in recent months.

Second, our victory was achieved under the conditions of a great disparity in military equipment between the enemy and us. Even under such circumstances, our People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army drove the invading army led by MacArthur from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel; our defenses have repeatedly frustrated the much-touted "killing offensives," "summer offensives," and "autumn offensives" of MacArthur, Ridgway, Van Fleet, etc., and have caused them to pay heavy casualties. By comparison, the relative combat effectiveness of the enemy and us is very clear.

Third, the difficulties we face in the war can be overcome, while the difficulties the enemy faces in the war cannot be overcome. The people of China and Korea are fighting against the aggressors on their own soil and in front of their own country, and are not only receiving full support from their own people, but also receiving support from peace-loving people all over the world. The enemy is invading us from tens of thousands of miles across the ocean, and therefore they do not receive the support of the masses and are at odds with peace-loving people all over the world. The enemy's forces are limited, and because they are acting without justification, the morale of the army is not high and is declining day by day. These are difficulties they can never overcome. The only thing the imperialist war-mongers rely on is that they have more steel. But it is not dead iron that determines the outcome of war and the fate of history, but the living people who use iron. Since the American aggressors are engaged in a reactionary and unjust war of aggression, while the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are engaged in a progressive and just war of anti-aggression, then defeat cannot but belong to the American aggressors. Chairman Mao pointed out on June 28, 1950: "The United States' interference in the internal affairs of Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc. is completely unreasonable. The sympathy of the entire Chinese people and the sympathy of the vast majority of people in the world will be on the side of the invaded, and certainly not on the side of American imperialism." On February 16th of this year, Marshal Stalin issued a statement saying: "If Britain and the United States finally reject the peaceful proposals of the Chinese People's Government, then the Korean War can only end in the defeat of the interventionists." Marshal Stalin pointed out that the reason why the American and British interventionists are bound to fail is because their soldiers believe that their "war against Korea and China is an unjust war. ... This war is extremely unpopular among American and British soldiers. Indeed, it is difficult to make soldiers believe that China, which neither threatens Britain nor threatens the United States, and whose island of Taiwan has been forcibly occupied by the United States, is the aggressor, while on the other hand, the United States, which has forcibly occupied Taiwan and pushed its troops to the Chinese border, is on the defensive. It is also difficult to make soldiers believe that the United States has the right to defend its security on Korean territory and on the Chinese border, while China and Korea do not have the right to defend their security on their own territory and within their own borders. Therefore, this war is unpopular among American and British soldiers. It is very clear that if soldiers believe that the war they are being forced to fight is extremely unjust, and if soldiers therefore only perform their duties formally on the front line, without believing in the justice of their mission and without enthusiasm, then even the most experienced generals and officers will fail." The facts have fully proven the correctness of this brilliant judgment by Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin.

(II)

Over the past year, the national people's patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in the rear, in coordination with the Volunteers' operations on the front line, has also achieved great results.

The masses of people across the country have participated in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, including the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, including all nationalities and people of various religious beliefs. Seventy to eighty percent of the country's population has participated in patriotic actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and has received patriotic education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Around May 1st, International Labor Day, this year, more than 229.9 million people across the country participated in demonstrations to resist U.S. aggression, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace. From April to July this year, the number of people who voted against the United States arming Japan was more than 339.9 million, and the number of people who signed their names demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace pact was more than 344 million. These figures show that the scale of this anti-imperialist patriotic movement is unprecedented in our country's history.

The people have shown unlimited enthusiasm in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Over the past year, the broad masses of the people have volunteered to join the People's Volunteers, and touching stories of mothers sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers vying to enlist have emerged everywhere. Thousands of peasants and transport workers have volunteered to go to Korea to undertake various logistical tasks on the battlefield. Medical workers from all over the country have volunteered to organize more than 50 medical teams to serve the Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Korean front. The people of the whole country have universally and enthusiastically launched a movement to comfort the Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and millions of letters of comfort, gifts of comfort, and bags of comfort have been sent to the front line. The Chinese People's Delegation to Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers' Returning Delegation and the returning combat heroes have universally conducted comfort visits and delivered reports on the front line and in various parts of the rear, which has played a significant role in boosting the morale of the front line and the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in the rear. People everywhere have helped revolutionary soldiers and families of revolutionary martyrs to solve their difficulties with great enthusiasm. In order to support the front line, the people of the whole country have launched a movement to increase production and donate funds; as of October 18th, in just four and a half months, donations equivalent to 2,618 fighter planes have been made, i.e., 392.7 billion yuan, and the actual cash paid has exceeded half of the pledged donations. In order to defend our great motherland and build a strong and modern national defense force, 580,000 young students and young workers across the country have volunteered to join various military cadre schools. Many workers and peasants have said: "Now we are all prepared, as long as the order is given, we have people, we have money, we have everything we need." This statement can represent the will and mood of the people of all strata across the country, and this is precisely the guarantee that we can achieve final victory.

The Chinese people have quickly swept away the influence of various aggressive activities of the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, in China in the past, eliminated the residual economic aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, and adopted a firm policy of suppression against all imperialist agents and spies. This vigorous movement to eliminate the residual forces of imperialism has not only been launched among workers, peasants, youth, women, and the business community, but also among patriotic believers of Christianity and Catholicism.

In the practice of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, people from all walks of life in China have realized that the American imperialists are the most dangerous enemies of the Chinese people, that all peace-loving and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world are the best friends of the Chinese people, and that the great Sino-Soviet friendship alliance is the most powerful guarantee for defending peace and democracy in the East and the world. The "leaning to one side" foreign policy advocated by Chairman Mao has now become the unanimous program of action of the people of the whole country. Patriotism and internationalism, which are closely combined and inseparable, have now become the political common sense of the people of the whole country.

Our various reform and construction tasks have also progressed rapidly in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, as Chairman Mao said in his opening speech and Premier Zhou in his political report. The unity of the people of all strata has been further consolidated.

In the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the patriotic people created the method of drawing up patriotic pacts. This method has been rapidly and universally promoted in various parts of the country. In the three major administrative regions of North China, Northeast China, and East China, 50 percent of the population has drawn up patriotic pacts, and the number of people who have drawn up pacts in cities is even greater. As a result of correctly drawing up and implementing patriotic pacts, the political awareness of the people has been rapidly improved, the relationship between the people and the people's government has become even closer, the unity among the people of all strata has been further strengthened, and national defense construction, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, industrial and agricultural production, political and cultural learning, and other tasks have been further advanced. In many rural areas, because patriotic pacts have been drawn up, peasants' mutual assistance in production, political and cultural learning, and preferential treatment work have become more planned and organized. In many factories and enterprises, because patriotic pacts have been drawn up, the steps of the Communist Party branch, administrative leaders, trade unions, Youth League branches, and all workers have been unified, and production efficiency has been improved. Many industrialists and businessmen in various places, because they have drawn up and implemented patriotic pacts, have not only improved their operations, but also ensured that they pay their taxes in full every month, eliminating tax arrears. Residents of many cities have said: "Since the patriotic pact was drawn up, the atmosphere has been renewed, production has increased, life has improved, learning has progressed, unity has been strengthened, and even bad habits have been changed." It can be seen that the patriotic pact movement can not only play its great role in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but will continue to play its great role in the long period of construction work in the future.

The above-mentioned great achievements were obtained under the encouragement of the Volunteers' victorious operations, and these achievements have powerfully supported the Volunteers' heroic operations. The close leadership and hard work of the Communist Party of China and the various democratic parties at all levels, the various people's organizations, and the patriotic activists of all circles are the decisive conditions for the rapid development and achievement of the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

(III)

We Chinese people love peace. From the time when American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people and government have consistently advocated resolving the Korean issue by peaceful means. After the Korean armistice negotiations began, we have continued to make unremitting efforts to strive for the realization of the Korean armistice. This position of the Chinese people is completely consistent with the peace aspirations of the people of the world. As long as the American government can accept the lessons of its disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield in the past and is willing to end the war of aggression against Korea, then the Korean armistice can be quickly realized. However, because the American government continues to create various obstacles to undermine and obstruct the progress of the armistice negotiations, the negotiations have not yet yielded results. We fully support the position adopted by the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean negotiations, and demand that the American aggressors immediately abandon the policy of delaying negotiations and that this negotiation quickly obtain a fair and reasonable result.

Since the American imperialists are still delaying negotiations, continuing their desperate offensive, still occupying our Taiwan, continuing to violate our airspace, continuing to impose a blockade and sabotage on our country, and are arming Japan, threatening China, the Far East, and world peace, our struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country must continue to be intensified. Our main tasks are:

First, further mobilize our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to continuously supply the front line to support the just war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

Second, continue to develop and deepen patriotic education, so that everyone in every part of the country receives education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and further promote their patriotic feelings to a higher degree, and become conscious masters of the People's Republic of China. To this end, we should continue to strengthen the patriotic content in school education; consolidate and expand various organizations that conduct current affairs propaganda and patriotic education among the masses; promote propaganda work in public places; and improve the editing and distribution of current affairs books and periodicals to meet the needs of the broad masses.

Third, thoroughly eliminate imperialist agents and spies lurking in every corner of China. Continue to develop the movement of self-government, self-propagation, and self-support in religious circles. All patriotic believers of Christianity and Catholicism must thoroughly eliminate the imperialist elements in the church, thoroughly sever all ties between the Chinese church and imperialism, and maintain the dignity of the great Chinese people.

Fourth, launch a patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy. Launch patriotic competitions to increase industrial and agricultural production, improve enterprise management, and improve the efficiency of various tasks; launch a movement to practice economy in factories, enterprises, and government agencies, and oppose corruption and waste; and cherish public property and the fruits of the struggle for land reform.

Fifth, strive to complete and continue to expand the movement to donate weapons. Ensure that the planned donation is completed within this year.

Sixth, continue to strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and families of martyrs. Party and government organs and people's organizations at all levels must always grasp the leadership of this work and constantly check it to ensure the implementation of the preferential treatment plan. We propose that around the Spring Festival next year, all parts of the country conduct another general inspection of the work of preferential treatment, and formulate a specific plan for the work of preferential treatment next year with the jurisdiction of the primary government as the unit.

Seventh, further popularize and deepen the patriotic pact movement. Those who have not drawn up a patriotic pact should draw it up according to the basic units of production, work, and study; those who have drawn it up should check the implementation status on a monthly or weekly basis, and summarize and revise it every quarter or every half year. The patriotic pact is a basic form for people of all strata to carry out common patriotic activities and patriotic education, improve organization, and improve work efficiency. It must be promoted for a long time, continuously improved, and the activists in this movement must be trained. We suggest that in January next year, all parts of the country conduct a general inspection of the drawing up and implementation of patriotic pacts, and revise the content of the pacts according to the new situation.

In order to continue to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in a planned way, we request that all parts of the country include the work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea as one of the central topics for discussion at the recent people's representative conferences at all levels.

Comrades! For the sake of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, the heroic operations carried out by our great Chinese People's Volunteers on the front line, and the vigorous movements carried out by the people of all strata in various places across the country, not only have an extremely great role in guaranteeing the safety and happiness of the people of China and Korea, but also have made a huge contribution to defending peace in the East and the world. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country must unite more closely and resolutely fight to the end for the victorious solution of the Korean issue and the liberation of Taiwan! Let us shout:

Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the battle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea!

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!

Long live the Korean People's Army!

Long live the militant unity of the Chinese and Korean peoples!

Long live the friendship alliance between China and the Soviet Union!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

    关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告
    ——一九五一年十月二十四日在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的报告彭真主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    周总理的政治报告，我完全同意。现在我代表中国人民抗美援朝总会，报告一年来全国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动的情况和今后的工作。
         （一）
    中国人民的抗美援朝斗争，从去年十月二十五日中国人民志愿军出国作战的那一天算起，已经进行一年了。这个斗争，是中国人民在取得解放战争的胜利、把美国侵略势力赶出中国大陆后所进行的又一次伟大的反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    毛主席在我们会议的开会词中说：“我们不要去侵犯任何国家，我们只是反对帝国主义者对于我国的侵略。大家都明白，如果不是美国军队占领我国的台湾、侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和打到了我国的东北边疆，中国人民是不会和美国军队作战的。但是既然美国侵略者已经向我们进攻了，我们就不能不举起反侵略的旗帜，这是完全必要的和完全正义的，全国人民都已明白这种必要性和正义性。”
    一年以来，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，在朝鲜前线的英勇作战中取得了伟大的胜利。自去年十月二十五日起到今年十月十日，我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军已经击毙、杀伤和俘虏了敌军三十八万七千余名，其中美军十七万六千余名；击落、击伤、缴获敌军飞机二千三百一十架，缴获敌人其他各种武器无算。美国侵略者及其帮凶和傀儡的军队因为遭受了中朝人民部队沉重打击，已经被迫回到他们发动侵略的出发点，即三八线附近一带。
    在朝鲜的反侵略战争的胜利，证明了美帝国主义是外强中干的，是脆弱的，本质上不过是一只“纸老虎”，它的侵略是可以击败的。
    第一、我们的胜利使美帝国主义在朝鲜蒙受了异乎寻常的并且愈来愈大的损失。现在美军被歼总数已经超过十七万，就是说，在过去不到一年的期间，美军被歼总数已经相当于太平洋战争第一年美军伤亡总数的三倍。敌军每月损失的人数，在去年十月二十五日起的三个月内是二万一千二百五十八人；第四至第七个月平均三万一千二百九十人；第八至第十一个月平均四万零六百九十三人；而在九月二十五日到十月十日为止的半个月内，敌人的损失已达三万零七百零三人，就是达到了最初三个月平均数的二点九倍。敌我伤亡的比例，在最近几个月中，已经上升到二比一左右。
    第二、我们的胜利是在敌我双方军事装备悬殊的条件下得来的。就在这样的情况下，我们的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军把麦克阿瑟所统率的侵略军从鸭绿江赶回三八线；我们的防御先后使麦克阿瑟、李奇微、范佛里特等大吹大擂的“杀伤攻势”、“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”，一次又一次地破产，并且使他们付出惨重的伤亡。这样一比较，敌我双方战斗力的高下究竟如何，就是很明白的了。
    第三、我们在战争中的困难是可以克服的，而敌人在战争中的困难却是不能克服的。朝中两国人民是在自己的国土上和国门前向侵略者作战，不但得到本国人民充分的支援，而且还得到全世界爱好和平的人民的支援。敌人是从数万里之外远涉重洋，向我们进行侵略的，因此，他们得不到群众的支持，并且和全世界爱好和平的人民为敌。敌人的兵力有限，又因师出无名，军队的士气不高，而且在逐日消沉。这些都是他们永远无法克服的困难。帝国主义战争贩子们所凭借的仅仅是他们拥有较多的钢铁。但是决定战争胜负和历史命运的并不是死的铁，而是使用铁的活的人。既然美国侵略者所从事的侵略战争是反动的，非正义的，而中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军方面所从事的反侵略战争，乃是进步的，正义的，那么，失败就不能不属于美国侵略者方面。毛主席一九五○年六月二十八日就指出：“美国对朝鲜、菲律宾、越南等国内政的干涉，是完全没有道理的，全中国人民的同情和全世界广大人民的同情都将在被侵略者方面，而决不会在美帝国主义方面。”今年二月十六日斯大林大元帅发表谈话说：“如果英国和美国终于拒绝了中国人民政府的和平建议，那么朝鲜战争便只能以干涉者的失败而告终。”斯大林大元帅指出，美英干涉者之所以必然失败，是由于他们的士兵们认为他们“对朝鲜和中国的战争是非正义的战争。……这个战争在美国的和英国的士兵中是极端不得人心的。的确，要使士兵们相信：既不威胁英国、又不威胁美国、而其台湾岛竟被美国强占了的中国是侵略者，而另一方面，强占了台湾、并将军队推向中国边境的美国倒是处于防御方面，这是很困难的。要使士兵们相信：美国有权利在朝鲜领土上和中国边境上保卫美国的安全，而中国和朝鲜却没有权利在它们自己的领土上和它们自己的国境上保卫它们的安全，这也是很困难的。因此，这个战争在美英士兵中是不得人心的。这是很清楚的，如果士兵们认为强迫他们进行的战争是极端非正义的，如果士兵们因此而在前线上只是形式上执行职务，既不相信他们的使命合乎正义，也没有热情，那么就是最有经验的将领和军官也要失败的。”事实完全证明了毛主席和斯大林大元帅这种英明的论断。
    （二）
    一年来我们全国人民在后方的抗美援朝爱国运动，和志愿军在前线的作战相配合，也已经取得了伟大的成绩。
    全国的群众参加了抗美援朝的斗争，这些群众包括工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，包括各民族和各种宗教信仰者。全国已经有百分之七十至八十的人口，参加了抗美援朝的爱国行动，受到了抗美援朝的爱国教育。今年五月一日国际劳动节前后，全国有二亿二千九百九十余万人参加了抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平的示威游行。今年四月到七月，投票反对美国武装日本的人数有三亿三千九百九十万人以上，签名要求缔结五大国和平公约的人数，有三亿四千四百余万人。这些数字说明了这次反帝国主义的爱国运动规模的巨大在我国历史上是空前的。
    人民群众在抗美援朝的斗争中表现了无限的积极性。一年来，广大人民群众纷纷志愿报名参加人民志愿军，到处出现了母亲送儿子、妻子送丈夫、兄弟争入伍等可歌可泣的事迹。有成千成万的农民和运输工人，志愿赴朝担任战地的各种勤务工作。全国各地医务工作者志愿组织了五十多个医疗队到朝鲜前线，为志愿军和朝鲜人民军服务。全国人民普遍热烈地展开了慰问志愿军和朝鲜人民军的运动，已经有几百万件的慰问信、慰问品、慰问袋送到了前线。中国人民赴朝慰问团和中国人民志愿军归国代表团和归国的战斗英雄们，在前线和后方各地普遍进行了慰问和传达报告，对于提高前方的士气和后方人民的爱国热情起了重大的作用。各地人民以高度的热情帮助革命军人和革命烈士家属解决困难。全国人民为了支援前线，开展了增产捐献运动；截至十月十八日为止，仅仅四个半月的时间，就捐献了相当于二千六百十八架战斗机的金钱，即三万九千二百七十亿元，实缴的现款已超过了认捐的半数。为了保卫我们伟大的祖国，建设强大的现代化的国防军，全国已有五十八万的青年学生和青年工人，志愿报名参加各种军事干部学校。很多的工人和农民都说：“现在我们一切都准备好了，只要命令一下，要人有人，要钱有钱，要什么有什么。”这种话是可以代表全国各阶层人民的意志和心情的，这正是我们能够取得最后胜利的保证。
    中国人民迅速地扫除了帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者过去在中国各种侵略活动的影响，清除了美帝国主义在中国残余的经济侵略势力，并且对于一切帝国主义的特务、间谍分子，采取了坚决的镇压政策。这种清除帝国主义残余势力的轰轰烈烈的运动，不仅在工人、农民、青年、妇女和工商界中展开了，并且在基督教和天主教的爱国教徒中也展开了。
    中国各阶层人民在抗美援朝斗争的实践中，认识了美帝国主义者是中国人民最危险的敌人，认识了以苏联为首的所有和平民主国家和全世界所有爱好和平的人们，乃是中国人民最好的朋友，而伟大的中苏两国的友好同盟，则是保卫东方和世界和平民主的最有力保证。毛主席所号召的“一边倒”的外交政策，现在已经成了全国人民一致的行动纲领。爱国主义与国际主义，两者是密切结合而不可分的，现在已经成了全国人民的政治常识了。
    我们的各项改革工作和建设工作，正如毛主席在开会词和周总理在政治报告中所说，在抗美援朝运动中也都迅速进展了。各阶层人民的团结更加巩固了。
    在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，爱国的人民群众创造了订立爱国公约的办法。这种办法已经迅速地在全国各地普遍推行。在华北、东北和华东三大行政区，已有百分之五十的人口订立了爱国公约，城市中订约的人数更多。正确地订立和执行爱国公约的结果，人民群众的政治觉悟迅速地提高了，人民群众和人民政府的关系更加亲密无间了，各阶层人民互相间的团结更进一步增强了，国防建设、土地改革、镇压反革命、工农业生产、政治文化学习以及其他各项工作都进一步向前推进了。许多农村因为订立了爱国公约，农民的生产互助、政治文化学习和优抚工作都更加有计划有组织了。许多工厂企业因为订立了爱国公约，统一了共产党的支部、行政首长、工会、青年团支部以及各个工人的步调，生产效率提高了。许多地方的工商业家，因为订立和执行了爱国公约，不仅改善了经营，并且保证了每月缴清本月的税收，消灭了欠税现象。许多城市的居民说：“订了爱国公约气象一新，生产增加，生活好转，学习进步，团结加强，连坏习惯都改掉了。”由此可见，爱国公约运动不但能够在抗美援朝斗争中发挥它的伟大作用，而且在今后建设工作的长时期内仍将继续发挥它的伟大作用。
    上面这些伟大的成就，是在志愿军作战胜利的鼓舞下获得的，这些成就又有力地支援了志愿军的英勇作战。中国共产党和各民主党派的各级组织、各级人民团体以及各界爱国积极分子的抓紧领导和努力工作，是抗美援朝爱国运动迅速开展并获得成绩的决定的条件。（三）
    我们中国人民是爱好和平的。从美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争的时候起，中国人民和政府就一贯主张用和平方式解决朝鲜问题。朝鲜停战谈判开始后，我们又一直坚持不懈地努力争取朝鲜停战的实现。中国人民的这种立场，是和全世界人民的和平愿望完全一致的。只要美国政府能够接受过去它在朝鲜战场上遭受惨败的教训，愿意终止对朝鲜的侵略战争，那么，朝鲜的停战是可以迅速实现的。可是因为美国政府不断地制造各种障碍来破坏和阻挠停战谈判的进行，谈判至今还没有结果。我们完全拥护朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的代表团在朝鲜谈判中所采取的立场，要求美国侵略者立即放弃拖延谈判的政策，并使这个谈判迅速得到公平合理的结果。
    美帝国主义者既然还在拖延谈判，继续着他们绝望的进攻，还在侵占我国的台湾，继续侵犯我国的领空，继续对我国实行封锁和破坏，并且正在武装日本、威胁中国、远东和世界的和平，我们的抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争就必须继续加紧进行。我们的主要工作是：
    第一、进一步动员我们的人力、物力和财力，源源不绝地供给前线，以支持抗美援朝的正义战争。
    第二、继续发展和深入爱国主义的教育，使全国每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝的教育，并且更高度地发扬自己的爱国心，成为自觉的中华人民共和国的主人。为此目的，应当继续加强学校教育中爱国主义的内容；巩固和扩大在群众中进行时事宣传和爱国教育的各种组织；推广公共场所的宣传工作；改进时事书刊的编辑和发行工作，以适应广大群众的需要。
    第三、彻底地肃清暗藏在中国各个角落的帝国主义的特务间谍分子。继续发展宗教界的自治自传自养的运动。基督教、天主教的一切爱国教徒们，必须彻底肃清教会中的帝国主义分子，彻底割断中国教会与帝国主义之间的一切联系，保持伟大的中国人民的尊严。
    第四、开展爱国增产节约运动。开展增加工农业生产、改善企业经营、提高各种工作效率的爱国竞赛；开展工厂、企业、机关的节约运动，反对贪污、浪费；爱护公共财产和土地改革的斗争果实。
    第五、努力完成和继续扩大捐献武器运动。保证在今年内完成已订的捐献计划。
    第六、继续加强优待军人家属、烈士家属的工作。各级党政机关和人民团体对于这一工作，必须经常抓紧领导，并不断加以检查，切实保证优抚计划的执行。我们提议在明年春节前后全国各地对优抚工作再进行一次普遍的检查，并以基层政权的辖区为单位，订出明年优抚工作的具体计划。
    第七、进一步普及和深入爱国公约运动。凡未订立爱国公约的，要按照生产、工作、学习的基层单位来订立；已订立的要按月或按周检查执行状况，并于每季或每半年加以总结和修订。爱国公约是各阶层人民进行共同的爱国活动和爱国教育、提高组织性和工作效率的一种基本形式，必须长期推行，不断改进，并对这一运动中的积极分子加以训练。我们建议明年一月全国各地对爱国公约的订立和执行情形，普遍加以检查，并按照新的情况，把公约的内容加以修订。
    为了有计划地继续加强抗美援朝运动，我们要求全国各地都在最近召开的一次各界人民代表会议上，把抗美援朝工作列为中心议题之一加以讨论。
    同志们！为了抗美援朝保家卫国，我们伟大的中国人民志愿军在前线所进行的英勇的作战，全国各阶层人民在各地所进行的轰轰烈烈的运动，不但对于保障中朝两国人民的安全和幸福，具有极其伟大的作用，而且对于保卫东方和世界的和平也作了巨大的贡献。我们全国人民，在毛主席领导下，要更紧密地团结在一起，为胜利地解决朝鲜问题和解放台湾而坚决奋斗到底！让我们高呼：
    在抗美援朝战斗中牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    朝鲜人民军万岁！
    中朝人民的战斗团结万岁！
    中苏两国的友好同盟万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
