	I am a nurse in the People's Volunteer Army. Our medical rescue work in Korea is carried out under relatively harsh conditions. During the Second Battle, our group of five was responsible for receiving more than 120 wounded soldiers. At that time, houses were very scarce, and the wards were very scattered, each four or five li apart. We had to get up at three o'clock every morning to cook, and before dawn, we had to carry all the wounded and medical equipment to the mountains or air-raid shelters; then carry them back at night. Every day, we changed dressings, washed bandages, took temperatures, collected urine and feces, served meals, and delivered vegetables. We were busy until after eleven o'clock at night before we could rest. During work, I got sick and had a high fever. The leadership told me to rest, but when I saw the soldiers coming down from the front line, not making a sound even with serious injuries, I thought, what is my illness? So I persisted for more than ten days. Later, my illness became severe, and I was diagnosed with lobar pneumonia. I fainted several times, but with the careful care and medical treatment of my comrades, I soon recovered my health.

	In June of this year, we were responsible for transporting the wounded. There was a lack of supplies on the train, and even the wounded had problems eating and going to the toilet. I thought: Communists must never bow their heads to difficulties. We held a group meeting, and the comrades voluntarily donated some money to buy some vegetable basins and rice bowls. We also found some broken iron boxes and canned food boxes and made dozens of urinals and bedpans. In this way, the wounded did not lack daily necessities.

	We also conducted education on caring for the wounded and mutual aid within the group. Everyone made a pact to ensure that they would take good care of the wounded and would not leave them under any dangerous circumstances. On the evening of June 18th, at eleven o'clock, as the train was about to enter the station, it was suddenly attacked by two American planes. Machine gun bullets hit the train skin, causing sparks to fly. Comrades with minor injuries who could move got off the train to take cover, but the seriously wounded were lying down and unable to move. When I saw these comrades, I forgot about myself. Regardless of the enemy plane's bombing and strafing, I carried the seriously wounded one by one to a small ditch on the right side of the train to take cover. I carried fifteen in one breath. When I came back to carry the last three, they pushed me and said, "Comrade Jiang, you should take cover quickly, it's too dangerous. We are all disabled people, it doesn't matter if we sacrifice ourselves, you still have to take care of those wounded comrades!" At this moment, a rocket hit near us, and shrapnel, stones, and dirt fell around us. It was dangerous, but could I abandon these heroes? Absolutely not. Finally, I rescued them all.

	The enemy planes strafed blindly for several more tens of minutes before flying away. When we returned to the carriage, which had been hit by many holes by the enemy planes, the seriously wounded comrades all said that I had saved their lives. I said, "This is my responsibility." Because of this, the leadership awarded me a major merit. (Attached picture)

    在任何危险情况下我都不离开伤员们
    人民志愿军抢救伤员的功臣  姜淑华
    我是人民志愿军的一个女护士。我们在朝鲜做医疗救护工作，环境是比较艰苦的。在第二次战役的时候，我们组里五个人，担负了接收一百二十多个伤员的任务。当时房子非常缺少，病房很分散，每处相隔四五里远。我们每天早上三点多钟就要起床做饭，天亮前要把所有伤员和医疗器材都背到山上或防空洞里去；天黑再背回来。每天换药、洗敷料、试体温、接大小便、打饭、送菜，一直要忙到晚上十一点以后才能休息。在工作中我生了病，发高烧。上级叫我休息，但我看到前线下来的战士，负了重伤一声也不哼，我这点病算啥！所以我坚持了十多天。后来病重了，检查出来是大叶肺炎，曾昏过去几次，但在同志们的细心看护医疗之下，不久我又恢复了健康。
    今年六月，我们担任转运伤员的工作，车上缺少用具，连伤员吃饭、大小便都有问题。我想：共产党员无论怎样都不能向困难低头的。我们开了个小组会，同志们自动捐了一些钱，买了一些菜盆、饭碗。我们又找了一些破铁箱和罐头盒，做出了几十个大小便器。这样，伤员们的日常用具就不缺啦。
    我们又在组内进行了爱护伤员和团结互助的教育。大家订了公约，保证招扶好伤员，在任何危险的情况下都不离开伤员。六月十八日晚上十一点，火车快进车站的时候，突然遭到两架美国飞机的袭击。机枪弹打得车皮火星乱蹦。轻伤能走动的同志都下车隐蔽了，可是重伤员躺着不能动。我一看到这些同志，就忘记了自己。我不管敌机的轰炸扫射，一个一个地把重伤员背到车右边的小山沟里去隐蔽。我一口气背了十五个，等我又回来背最后的三个时，他们推着我说：“姜同志，你快隐蔽罢，多危险。我们都是些已经残废的人了，牺牲了不要紧，你还得去照顾那些伤员同志呀！”这时一颗火箭炮弹在我们的附近开了花，弹片、石子和泥土都落在我们身边。危险是危险的，但我能丢掉这些英雄不管吗？决不能。终于我把他们都抢救出来了。
    敌机又盲目地扫射了几十分钟才飞走了。当我们回到那被敌机打了许多窟窿的车厢时，重伤同志们都说我救了他们的命。我说：“这是我的责任。”就因为这件事，上级给我记了一大功。（附图片）
