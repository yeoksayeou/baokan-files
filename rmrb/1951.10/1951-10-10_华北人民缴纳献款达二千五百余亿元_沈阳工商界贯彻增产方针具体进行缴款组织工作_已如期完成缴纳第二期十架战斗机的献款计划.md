Xinhua News Agency, 9th: As of the end of September, the number of airplanes pledged for donation in the entire North China region had increased from 246 in August to 339, with Beijing and Tianjin adding 76, and Hebei Province continuing to pledge 17; donation payments reached over 255.6 billion yuan, accounting for more than 49.8 percent of the total pledged amount. The actual payments from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Suiyuan provinces have exceeded more than half of their respective six-month donation plans. By September 19th, Cangxian Prefecture in Hebei Province had paid 8.87827 billion yuan, exceeding the six-month donation plan for five fighter planes.

In the donations, factory and mine workers in various regions displayed a high degree of patriotism, striving to increase production to complete donation plans and create more wealth for the country. All employees of the Liulihe Cement Plant had originally pledged to donate one fighter plane. In the labor competition celebrating National Day, they proposed donating another fighter plane from increased production. The 26 new records created by the plant's employees in August alone reduced production costs by more than 10.6 percent, creating a super-profit of over 530 million yuan for the country. At the same time, they also guaranteed to complete the annual production plan one month ahead of schedule. The industrial and commercial circles in Baotou City, Suiyuan Province, launched a donation payment competition and have now paid 1.665 billion yuan, exceeding the donation plan for the "Baotou Industry and Commerce No. 1" fighter plane. The industrial and commercial circles in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, collectively paid weapon donations, and as of September 24th, the payments had exceeded two-thirds of the total pledged for half a year.

Farmers in various regions actively paid donations from the increased grain harvested in the autumn. As of September 21st, farmers in Shanxi Province had paid 9.48872 billion yuan. The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team completed the half-year production increase donation plan one month ahead of schedule. Because of the conscientious implementation of the production increase donation plan, the total value of increased production for the entire team reached 1 million yuan. In addition to paying off the half-year donation, the team members increased their income by 500,000 yuan.

[Xinhua News Agency News] The industrial and commercial circles in Shenyang City have completed the second phase donation payment plan as scheduled.

Since September 7th, when the industrial and commercial circles in Shenyang City responded to the payment competition initiated by the industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan City and launched a competition with the industrial and commercial circles in Northeast China, as of September 30th, they had paid the second phase donations for ten fighter planes, totaling 30.21 billion yuan together with the first phase donation for ten fighter planes already paid, completing two-thirds of the original six-month donation plan. Among the 87 industries in the city's industrial and commercial sector, civil engineering, earth and stone construction, paper making, soft drinks, and building materials have all completed the half-year donation plan; machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, electric saw timber industry, electrical equipment commerce, and ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industries have all exceeded or completed the second phase payment plan as scheduled. The Taiyang Tobacco Factory has completed 78 percent of the plan to donate a fighter plane independently.

The ability of Shenyang's industrial and commercial circles to make payments on schedule is due to the implementation of the policy of combining production increase with donation and the concrete organization of payment work. In the donation campaign, various industries in Shenyang's industrial and commercial sector mostly started by improving business management, improving quality, saving expenses, and accelerating capital turnover to formulate donation plans. After improving business management, the asbestos processing industry not only reduced costs, but also increased output by 20 percent compared to the past, with income in July doubling that of June. Because of the increased income in various industries, they have become more active in the patriotic donation campaign, thus ensuring the smooth completion of the donation plan. In terms of payment organization, the city's industrial and commercial circles established a Production Increase Donation Committee to uniformly lead the formulation of donation plans and payment work in various industries. The committee determined the specific goals of phased payments based on the specific circumstances of each industry. Each industry also had dedicated personnel responsible for checking, urging payment work, and launching competitions. Thus, the payment work was not left to its own devices, and the payment plan could be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule.

    华北人民缴纳献款达二千五百余亿元
    沈阳工商界贯彻增产方针具体进行缴款组织工作
    已如期完成缴纳第二期十架战斗机的献款计划
    【新华社九日讯】截至九月底，华北全区认捐飞机已由八月份的二百四十六架增加到三百三十九架，其中北京、天津两市增加七十六架，河北省继续认捐十七架；缴纳献款已达二千五百五十六亿余元，占认捐总额的百分之四十九点八强。北京、天津两市和河北、绥远两省实缴款数已超过各该地半年认捐计划的半数以上。河北省沧县专区到九月十九日已缴款八十八亿七千八百二十七万元，超额完成五架战斗机的半年捐献计划。
    在捐献中，各地厂矿职工发挥了高度爱国热情，努力增加生产，完成捐献计划，并为国家创造了更多财富。琉璃河水泥厂全体职工原已认捐战斗机一架，在庆祝国庆的劳动竞赛中，提出从增产中再捐献战斗机一架。该厂职工仅八月份创造的二十六件新纪录，即使生产成本降低百分之十点六强，为国家创造超额利润五亿三千多万元。同时，他们还保证把全年生产计划提前一个月完成。绥远省包头市工商界展开了缴纳捐款竞赛，现已缴纳十六亿六千五百余万元，超额完成了“包头工商第一号”战斗机的捐献计划。河北省石家庄市工商界，集体缴纳武器献款，截至九月二十四日缴款已超过半年认捐总额的三分之二。
    各地农民从秋收增产的粮食中，踊跃缴纳献款。山西省农民截至九月二十一日已缴款九十四亿八千八百七十二万元。李顺达互助组提前一个月超额完成了半年增产捐献计划。因为认真执行增产捐献计划，全组增产总值达一百万元，组员们除缴清半年捐款额外，还增加收入五十万元。
     【新华社讯】沈阳市工商界已如期完成了第二期缴纳献款的计划。
    沈阳工商界自九月七日响应武汉市工商界的缴款竞赛并与东北各地工商界开展竞赛后，截至九月三十日止，已缴齐了第二期十架战斗机的献款，连同第一期已经缴纳的十架战斗机的献款，共三百零二亿一千余万元，完成了原定半年捐献计划的三分之 二。该市工商界八十七个行业中，土木建筑、土石建筑、造纸、清凉饮料、建筑材料等行业已全部完成半年捐献计划；机器制造业、化学工业、电锯制材工业、电工器材商业、钢铁有色金属冶炼工业等三十二个行业也都超额或如数完成第二期缴款计划。太阳烟厂已完成了独捐一架战斗机的计划的百分之七十八。
    沈阳市工商界能够作到如期缴款，是由于贯彻了增产与捐献相结合的方针，并进行了缴款的具体组织工作。在捐献运动中，沈阳市工商界各行业多从改善经营管理、提高质量、节省开支，加速资金周转等方面着手，制订捐献计划。石绵加工业改善经营管理后，不仅降低了成本，产量亦较前增加百分之二十，七月份的收入即较六月份增加两倍。各行业因为收入增加，对爱国捐献运动都更加积极，因而保证了捐献计划的顺利完成。在缴款的组织工作上，该市工商界成立了增产捐献委员会，统一领导各行业订立捐献计划和缴款工作。该会根据各业者的具体情况，确定了分期缴款的具体目标。各行业也都有专人负责检查，督促缴款工作和发动竞赛。因而使缴款工作不致形成自流，缴款计划得以按期或提前完成。
