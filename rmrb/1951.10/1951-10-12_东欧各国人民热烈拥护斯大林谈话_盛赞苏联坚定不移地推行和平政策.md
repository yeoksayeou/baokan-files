Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: According to TASS, the people and public opinion in the German Democratic Republic and various Eastern European People's Democratic countries continue to comment on and support Stalin's talk on the issue of atomic weapons. Workers in Czechoslovakia, farmers in Bulgaria, scientists in Romania, and cultural and art workers in Hungary have published articles and statements in newspapers for days, unanimously supporting Stalin's talk. The people in both urban and rural areas of Poland have held mass rallies to discuss Stalin's replies to the Pravda reporter's questions. At the meetings, they undertook new production obligations, guaranteeing to contribute to the cause of peace by increasing labor productivity. In Albania, working people have gathered around loudspeakers in factories and farms these days, listening quietly to radio broadcasts of the full text of Stalin's talk and commentaries by prominent Albanian figures.

The official newspapers of the various Communist and Workers' Parties and other newspapers continue to publish editorials commenting on Stalin's talk. They unanimously pointed out that Stalin's talk seriously struck at the US imperialists' fantasy of monopolizing atomic weapons and promoted the efforts of the people of all countries to strive for peace and socialism. "Neues Deutschland," the central organ of the German Socialist Unity Party, said: "Stalin's statement shot down the weapon used by the American warmongers for threats and blackmail and exposed their arrogant dream of winning through an atomic blitzkrieg." An editorial in Poland's "Życie Warszawy" said: "Stalin's talk inspired the Polish people, gave them new strength, and further strengthened their struggle to realize the plan for building a socialist country - the Six-Year Plan." Czechoslovakia's "Lidová demokracie" pointed out: "Stalin's talk ended atomic diplomacy, settled the issue of atomic monopoly, and inflicted a devastating blow to all the imperialists' war plans based on atomic bombs." "Szabad Nép," the official newspaper of the Hungarian Working People's Party, said: "The fact that the Soviet Union also possesses atomic weapons has incalculable value in the people's struggle to ban atomic weapons. While strengthening its own strength, the Soviet Union is pursuing an unwavering policy of peace." Bulgaria's "Otechestven Front" continues to publish editorials discussing the Soviet Union's consistent policy of banning atomic weapons at previous international conferences.

    东欧各国人民热烈拥护斯大林谈话
    盛赞苏联坚定不移地推行和平政策
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社消息：德意志民主共和国和东欧各人民民主国家的人民和舆论继续评论和拥护斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话。捷克斯洛伐克的工人、保加利亚的农民、罗马尼亚的科学家和匈牙利的文化艺术工作者，连日在报纸上发表文章和声明，一致拥护斯大林的谈话。波兰的城乡人民纷纷举行群众大会，讨论斯大林的答真理报记者问。他们在会上承担了新的生产义务，保证以提高劳动生产率作为他们对和平事业的贡献。阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民这些天来都群集在工厂和农场的扩音器周围，静听电台转播斯大林的谈话全文和阿国著名人士的评论。
    各国共产党、工人党的机关报和其他报纸继续发表社论，评论斯大林的谈话。它们一致指出：斯大林的谈话严重地打击了美帝国主义垄断原子武器的幻想，并推动各国人民为和平与社会主义而努力奋斗。德国统一社会党中央机关报“新德意志报”说：“斯大林的声明击落了美国战争贩子手中用以进行威胁和讹诈的武器，而且揭发了他们想靠原子弹闪击获胜的狂妄的梦想。”波兰“华沙生活报”的社论说：“斯大林的谈话鼓舞了波兰人民，使他们获得了新的力量，进一步为实现建设社会主义国家的计划——六年计划而斗争。”捷克斯洛伐克的“人民报”指出：“斯大林的谈话结束了原子外交，清算了原子垄断，使帝国主义者一切以原子弹为基础的战争计划遭到毁灭性的打击。”匈牙利劳动人民党机关报“自由人民报”说：“苏联也拥有原子武器了，这个事实在人民争取禁止原子武器的斗争中，有着不可估量的价值。苏联一方面增强自身的力量，但另一方面在推行着坚定不移的和平政策。”保加利亚的“祖国阵线报”继续发表社论，论述苏联在历次国际会议上奉行始终不渝的禁止原子武器的政策。
