Since the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, in accordance with the cultural and educational policies stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has led educational workers throughout the country to reform the old educational system, educational content, and teaching methods in a planned and step-by-step manner, and has actively created new educational undertakings that meet the needs of national construction and the demands of the broad masses of the people. Over the past two years, the people's education in New China has achieved remarkable development and improvement, on a grand scale and full of vigor, making certain preparations for welcoming the cultural upsurge of our motherland.

One of the main tasks of reforming the old educational system is to reform the school system. The old school system we have used for the past two years has many serious shortcomings, the most important of which are: cadre schools for workers and peasants, as well as various literacy schools and training courses, do not have their proper place in the school system; the six-year study period for primary schools, divided into junior primary and senior primary levels, hinders the children of the broad working people, especially the children of peasants, from receiving complete elementary education; and various technical schools urgently needed to train national construction talents do not have a definite status and system. In order to smoothly promote the people's education cause in New China and to practice the tasks stipulated in the Common Program of raising the cultural level of the people and training talents for national construction, this old school system must be reformed. The Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government State Council convened its fourth plenary session in late May this year, discussed in detail the draft reform of the school system proposed by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and drafted the "Decision on the Reform of the School System," which was then reviewed and approved by the 97th State Council Meeting of the Central People's Government. Now, just as the people of the whole country are jubilantly celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic of China, it is promulgated and implemented by the State Council. This is a major event in the cause of people's education in China, and it is worth celebrating.

The new school system promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government today is completely suitable for the situation and needs of the early days of the People's Republic of China. It is formulated based on the policy of New Democracy education, the current needs of the country in all aspects, and the experience of China's educational work over a long period of time, especially the experience of educational work in the old liberated areas. It clearly and fully guarantees the opportunity for education for the people of the whole country, especially the working class, peasants and laboring people, and worker-peasant cadres, so that the children of urban and rural people can equally receive complete basic education, so that young people and adults can learn specialized scientific and technological knowledge and receive remedial education, so that young intellectuals and old intellectuals can receive revolutionary political education, and so that all working cadres have the opportunity to receive re-education. The implementation of this school system will promote the rapid improvement of the cultural level of our people, so that the national education cause can closely cooperate with the needs of various national construction undertakings, thereby promoting the upsurge of our culture and accelerating our country's transformation from an agricultural country to an industrial country. Therefore, the State Council's promulgation of this decision today is a great encouragement to the people of the whole country, especially to the working people and educational workers of the whole country. I hope that educational workers across the country will conscientiously proceed from the current actual situation of the country, use revolutionary spirit and methods, and work hard to implement this new school system in order to complete the above-mentioned glorious tasks.

The new school system must be promoted in a planned, step-by-step, prepared, and focused manner, according to the specific circumstances of political, economic, and cultural development in various regions, especially the characteristics of minority areas. The focus of our reform of the school system this time is worker-peasant cadre education, technical education, and primary school education. Our preparatory work should focus on the training of teachers at all levels of schools and the compilation and printing of teaching materials for various types of schools at all levels. Our implementation steps should proceed from cities to the countryside, from plains to mountains, and from central areas to remote areas. The implementation of the five-year primary school system should begin in 1952, starting with the first grade of primary school, and then reforming year by year according to the procedures of each grade, and must be fully completed within five years at the latest. In addition to the leadership of the education departments of governments at all levels, relevant departments and enterprise agencies should be responsible for the consolidation and development of secondary specialized education, specialized colleges, and junior colleges. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government will, in conjunction with the educational administrative departments of the major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, formulate specific and feasible plans in accordance with local conditions and based on the above-mentioned principles. First, conduct extensive publicity throughout the country so that people across the country understand the great significance and basic spirit of this reform of the school system, and then gradually implement it, striving to basically complete the huge task of school system reform nationwide from 1952 to 1957.

I hope that educational workers across the country will firmly stand under the banner of Mao Zedong, unite as one, bravely advance, overcome all difficulties, and strive to victoriously complete this arduous project of great historical significance!

    关于政务院公布改革学制的决定的谈话
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立以来，中央人民政府教育部即根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领所规定的文化教育政策，领导全国教育工作者在全国范围内有计划有步骤地进行改革旧的教育制度、教育内容和教学法，并积极地创办符合于国家建设需要和广大人民要求的新教育事业。两年来新中国的人民教育获得了显著的发展和提高，规模宏大，朝气蓬勃，为迎接我们祖国的文化高潮作了一定的准备。
    改革旧的教育制度的主要任务之一，就是改革学制。我们两年来沿用的旧学制，有许多严重的缺点，其中最主要的是：工人、农民的干部学校以及各种补习学校和训练班，在学校系统中没有应有的地位；小学修业年限定为六年并分为初级小学和高级小学两级的办法，妨碍广大劳动人民的子女，首先是农民的子女，受到完全的初等教育；为培养国家建设人才所迫切需要的各种技术学校，又没有一定的地位和制度。为了顺利推进新中国的人民教育事业和实践共同纲领所规定的提高人民文化水平和培养国家建设人才的任务，这种旧学制必须加以改革。中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会于今年五月下旬召开了第四次全体委员会议，对中央人民政府教育部所草拟的改革学制方案详加研讨，拟定了“关于改革学制的决定”的草案，复经中央人民政府政务院第九十七次政务会议核定。现在正当全国人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝我中华人民共和国成立两周年之时，由政务院公布施行。这是中国人民教育事业上一件重大的事情，是值得庆幸的。
    中央人民政府政务院今天所公布的新学制是完全适合于中华人民共和国初期的情况和需要的。它是根据新民主主义的教育的方针政策，当前国家各方面的需要以及长时期内我中国教育工作的经验，特别是老解放区教育工作的经验而制定的。它明确地和充分地保障了全国人民，尤其是工农劳动人民和工农干部受教育的机会，使城乡人民群众的子女能够平等地受到完全的基础教育，使青年和成年人能够学习专门的科学技术知识和受到补习教育，使青年知识分子和旧知识分子能够受到革命的政治教育，使一切工作干部有机会得到再教育。这个学制的实行，将促进我国人民的文化水平迅速提高，使国家教育事业与国家各项建设事业的需要密切配合，从而将促进我国文化的高涨，并加速我们国家从农业国到工业国的转变。因此政务院今天公布这个决定，对于全国人民，首先对于全国劳动人民和全国教育工作者，是一个极大的鼓舞。我希望全国教育工作者切实地从当前国家的实际情况出发，用革命的精神和办法，努力实行这个新学制，以完成上述的光荣任务。
    新学制必须根据各地区政治、经济、文化发展的具体情况，特别是少数民族地区的特点，有计划、有步骤、有准备、有重点地来推行。我们这次改革学制的重点是工农干部教育、技术教育和小学教育。我们的准备工作应该集中于各级学校师资的培养和各级各类学校教材的编印工作。我们的实施步骤，应该从城市向乡村，从平原向山地，从中心地区向边远地区。对于小学五年制的实施，应在一九五二年开始，从小学一年级改起，以后按照各年级程序，逐年改革，最迟须在五年内全部完成。对于中等专业教育、专门学院和专科学校的整顿与发展，除各级人民政府教育部门应加以领导外，各有关部门和企业机关应以大力负责进行。中央人民政府教育部将协同各大行政区、各省、市教育行政部门按照各地情况，根据上述原则，制定具体可行的计划。首先在全国范围内进行广大的宣传，使全国人民都了解这次改革学制的重大意义和基本精神，然后逐步实施，争取从一九五二年到一九五七年在全国基本上完成学制改革的巨大工作。
    我希望全国教育工作者坚决地站在毛泽东的旗帜下，团结一致，奋勇前进，克服一切困难，为胜利地完成这一具有重大历史意义的艰巨工程而奋斗！
