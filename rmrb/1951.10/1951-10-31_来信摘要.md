Summary of Letters to the Editor

    Implementing the Marriage Law Requires Correcting Early Marriage
    The phenomenon of early marriage is still very common in Jiaxiang County, Pingyuan Province. People generally say, "If a daughter reaches seventeen or eighteen and isn't married, she'll end up as a concubine or marrying into a poor family" (meaning if a daughter gets too old, she won't find a good match). The boy from my eldest sister's family married a nineteen-year-old girl last year at the age of fifteen; the boy from my second sister's family is only twelve years old this year and is already engaged to a fifteen-year-old girl. Although some divorce cases have been handled in Jiaxiang County, focusing solely on properly handling divorce cases while neglecting the correction of early marriage is a major loophole in the implementation of the Marriage Law. I hope governments at all levels pay attention to this serious problem.
    In addition, I see that girls over fifteen years old in Tushan Bridge Village, Jiaxiang County, still have bound feet. Education should be carried out to prevent young women from suffering this pain again.

    To Stop Early Marriage and Abuse of Women
    The Key Lies in Cadres Studying and Publicizing the Marriage Law
    I believe that the key to stopping early marriage and the abuse of women lies in cadres studying and publicizing the Marriage Law. As far as I know: in Sangyuan Zhao Village, District 11, Qihe County, Shandong Province, seventeen children under the age of fifteen or sixteen have been married since last summer. Zhang Xiufu, the women's director of Hegou Li Village in District 11 of Qihe, has a son who is only thirteen years old this year and was married last year. The reason this phenomenon occurs is, on the one hand, due to the long-term influence of the past feudal marriage system, and on the other hand, because cadres at all levels and women's workers have not studied the Marriage Law well and are not actively publicizing it to the masses.
    Therefore, people's governments at all levels and women's workers must continue to lead all cadres in studying the Marriage Law and vigorously publicize it to the masses in order to eliminate the above phenomenon.

    I Should Not Have Been Passive About Wang Shuhua's Marriage
    There is a woman named Wang Shuhua in Yaojiafang Village, Xuanhua County, Chahar Province, who is twenty-four years old this year. Last summer, she divorced her husband and later fell in love with a young man named Liu Xijiu. Last autumn, they applied to the village government for marriage, but the village cadres did not approve it. The reason was that she had just divorced and was already in love, and they were afraid of negative reactions from the masses. When I came to work in the village, they thought I was a cadre from the province and would definitely help them, so they told me about this. The next day I asked the village cadres about this, and the cadres said the same thing as before, disagreeing with their marriage. I also made investigations among some of the masses, and these masses also disagreed with their marriage. The masses described the "suffering" of her original husband and asked me to persuade Wang Shuhua to remarry her original husband. The next night, I persuaded Wang Shuhua for a long time, but to no avail. I asked her, "What were your conditions when you divorced?" She said, "For more than ten years, we ignored each other and lived in a very awkward situation." Finally, I said, "Go to the county to resolve it, we won't take care of it."
    This May, Wang Shuhua and Liu Xijiu formally married. When they got married, the county made a detailed investigation and believed that their love was correct. I now realize that I made a mistake in the past regarding Wang Shuhua's marriage and violated the spirit of the Marriage Law. I will faithfully publicize and implement the Marriage Law in the future.

    We Will Definitely Build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Well!
    Last autumn, the people along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in the Southern Sichuan District organized a strong road-building team of more than 30,000 laborers to actively participate in the construction of the historically significant and great construction project - the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. In the process of construction, we overcame all difficulties and accepted advanced experience in filling and compacting the earth, thereby greatly improving the quality and efficiency of the project. Since the start of construction, the entire Southern Sichuan District has completed more than 10 million standard work units of earth and stone, with an average work efficiency of over 140%. Now the train has already run from Chongqing to Pimu Town, only eight or nine kilometers away from Neijiang City. This is a great happy event that the people of Southwest China have been looking forward to for more than 40 years. How can we not be happy?
    Now, we eat rice and dry rice, and wear new clothes made of fine cloth. Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, we must first thank Chairman Mao's wise leadership, and we will always follow Chairman Mao!
    We assure Chairman Mao: We will work hard and definitely build the people's railway even better.

    Anguo Yang Basheng Mutual Aid Group Actively Sells Cotton
    Strive to Exceed the Presale Cotton Quantity
    The Yang Basheng Mutual Aid Group in Anguo County, Hebei Province, planted 105 mu of cotton this year. Under the leadership of the government and with the strong support of the cooperative, they overcame insect pests and achieved a bumper harvest, with each mu of garden land yielding about 350 jin of cotton. The group has now sold 3,800 jin of standard large-seed cotton that has been picked, cleaned, and dried to the cooperative. In order to fulfill the contract signed with the cooperative this spring to presell 8,500 jin of seed cotton, the group members are discussing picking, cleaning, drying, and storing all of the more than 14,000 jin of cotton flowers that have been picked and sprayed for the cooperative, striving to exceed the quantity stipulated in the presale contract. They are all very confident. Wang Manxin's wife, a member of the group, said, "If the government and the cooperative hadn't provided us with fertilizer and insecticides in the spring and summer, we wouldn't have been able to pick this much cotton. We haven't delivered enough of the presale seed cotton contracted by our group, so we need to work harder to pick and deliver it quickly." Driven by the Yang Basheng Mutual Aid Group, the Yang Mandou, Yang Longzi, and Huang Erdan Mutual Aid Groups in the county are also actively delivering presale cotton to the cooperative.

    State-Owned Trading Companies in Various Regions
    Should Combine Procurement with Material Supply Work
    This year, after cotton farmers pick new cotton, they need to exchange it for grain. However, state-owned trading companies in the cotton-producing areas of Hekou and Xin'an in Hunan have a mentality of being reluctant to sell and afraid to sell, and they dare not boldly supply grain, resulting in a phenomenon in some areas where the market price of grain exceeds the listed price, causing dissatisfaction among cotton farmers and increasing their concerns about not being able to buy grain after selling cotton, thus showing indifference to selling cotton.
    In addition, in grain-producing areas and other special product areas, some state-owned trade departments underestimated the purchasing power of farmers in advance and did not prepare enough materials, so that when the huge purchasing power of farmers entered the market, the personnel of these trade companies were in a state of confusion. For example, the trading company of the Huitong Special District originally estimated that it would need to add 5,000 bolts of Guangqing cloth, but after the 5,000 bolts of cloth were transported, they were all allocated by the county trading companies at once, and it was still not enough.
    Therefore, I suggest that state-owned trading companies in various regions should systematically and timely allocate and prepare sufficient grain to meet the needs of cotton-producing areas. At the same time, they should also prepare sufficient materials to meet the needs of general areas. Trading companies should also organize and drive private handicraftsmen to eliminate concerns, produce in large quantities, and organize private merchants to actively participate in exchange work.

    来信摘要
    贯彻婚姻法要纠正早婚现象
    平原省嘉祥县早婚现象仍很普遍。一般还说：“女儿长到十七八，不嫁填房嫁穷家”（意思是说女儿大了就嫁不到好人家了）。我大姐家的男孩子，去年十五岁就与一个十九岁的姑娘结婚了；二姐家的男孩子今年才十二岁就与一个十五岁的姑娘订了婚。虽然嘉祥县有些离婚的案件已经处理，但是单从正确处理离婚案件上去贯彻婚姻法，而忽略了纠正早婚现象，也是贯彻执行婚姻法中的一大漏洞。我希望各级政府注意这一严重问题。
    此外，我看到嘉祥县土山桥村十五岁以上的姑娘还都缠着小脚，也应该注意进行教育，免得青年妇女再受此痛苦。

    制止早婚及虐害妇女现象
    关键在于干部学习与宣传婚姻法
    我觉得干部学习与宣传婚姻法，是制止早婚和制止虐害妇女的关键。据我所知：如山东省齐河县十一区桑园赵庄一村，从去年夏季到现在就有十七个不到十五、六岁的孩子结了婚。齐河十一区河沟李庄妇女主任张秀甫的儿子，今年才十三岁，去年就结了婚。这种现象之所以发生，一方面固然是由于过去封建婚姻制度的长期影响，而另一方面，则是因为各级干部及妇女工作者没很好地学习婚姻法，不积极向群众宣传婚姻法。
    因此，各级人民政府和妇女工作者，必须继续不断地领导全体干部学习婚姻法，并向群众大力宣传，以杜绝上述现象的发生。    李春华
    我不该消极对待王淑花的婚事
    察哈尔省宣化县姚家房村有一个妇女叫王淑花，今年二十四岁。去年夏天她与丈夫离了婚，后来又与青年刘锡九恋爱。去年秋天他们曾向村政府要求结婚，可是村干部没有批准。理由是她刚离婚就恋爱，怕群众反映不好。我到该村工作时，他俩认为我是省里的干部，一定会帮助她们，就向我谈了这件事。第二天我向村干部问起这事，干部们如前所说一样，不同意他们结婚。我又向一些群众作了调查，这些群众也不同意他们的婚事。群众并把她原来丈夫的“苦处”说了一顿，要求我劝说王淑花，要她和原丈夫复婚。第二天晚上，我就劝说了王淑花半天，没有收效。我问她：“你离婚时有啥条件？”她说：“十几年来，谁也不理谁，过着实在蹩扭。”最后我说：“你到县去解决吧，我们不管这事。”
    今年五月，王淑花和刘锡九正式结婚了。结婚时，县里曾详细调查过，认为他们的恋爱很正确。我现在认识到，自己过去在王淑花的婚姻问题上，是犯了错误，是违背了婚姻法的精神了。我以后一定要忠实地宣传执行婚姻法。

    我们一定把成渝铁路修好！
    去年秋天，川南区成渝铁路沿线的人民，组织了一支三万多民工的强大的筑路队，积极地参加修筑具有历史意义的伟大的建设工程——成渝铁路。在建筑的过程中，我们克服了一切困难，接受了先进的填土打夯经验，因而大大地提高了工程的质量和工效。整个川南区自开工到现在，土石方共完成了一千多万个标准工，平均工效在百分之一百四十以上。现在火车已经从重庆通车到椑木镇，距内江市只有八九公里了。这是西南人民盼望了四十多年的大喜事，我们怎能不高兴呢？
    现在，我们吃的是大米干饭，穿的是细布新衣服。想想从前，比比现在，我们首先要感谢毛主席的英明领导，我们永远跟着毛主席走！
    我们向毛主席保证：努力工作，一定把人民的铁路修得更好。

    安国杨八生互助组积极售棉
    争取超额完成预售棉花数量
    河北省安国县杨八生互助组，今年种了一百零五亩棉花，他们在政府领导与合作社大力扶助下，战胜虫灾，取得了丰收，每亩园地约可摘棉三百五十多斤。现该组已卖给合作社拣晒干净的标准大籽棉三千八百斤。为了完成今春与合作社订的预售八千五百斤籽棉合同，组员们正商议着把摘下的一万四千多斤中喷花拣净晒干，全部售储给合作社，争取超额完成预售时合同上所订的数量。他们的信心都很高，组员王满心的媳妇说：“春夏要不是政府和合作社贷给肥料和杀虫药，也摘不了这些棉花。咱们组里订的预售籽棉合同，还没交够，要加劲快拣交上。”在杨八生互助组的带动下，该县杨满斗、杨聋子、黄二旦等互助组，也都积极向合作社送交预售的棉花。

    各地国营贸易公司
    应结合收购做好物资供应工作
    今年棉农摘下新花后，需要换粮食。但是湖南合口、新安一带产棉区的国营贸易公司，存在着惜售、怕售的心理，不敢放手大胆供应粮食，以致个别地区产生粮食市价超过牌价的现象，造成棉农不满，增加了他们怕卖了棉花买不到粮食的顾虑，因而对售棉表示冷淡。
    此外，在产粮区和其他特产品地区，有些国营贸易部门事前对农民购买力估计不足，物资准备不够，以致农民的巨大购买力投入市场时，使这些贸易公司人员手忙脚乱起来。如会同专区贸易公司原估计需要加光青布五千匹，但五千匹布运到后，一次便被各县贸易公司全部拨光，而且还嫌不够。
    因此，我建议各地国营贸易公司，应当有计划地及时调拨和准备充足的粮食供应产棉区的需要。同时，还要准备足够的物资，供应一般地区的需要。贸易公司并要组织和带动私营手工业者，消除顾虑，大量生产，组织私商踊跃参加交流工作。
