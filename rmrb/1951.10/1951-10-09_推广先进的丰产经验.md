    Promoting Advanced Experiences in Achieving High Yields

    Using the masses' experiences to educate the masses is our Party's most fundamental leadership method. The Agricultural Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government recently issued a notice to all special districts, counties, and cities in the province, entitled "Attention to Conducting Agricultural High-Yield Surveys," requiring a widespread high-yield survey to be conducted throughout the province, in order to summarize the masses' high-yield experiences using scientific methods. These high-yield experiences and examples will be used as teaching materials for this year's winter school and next year's agricultural technology training classes. This approach of the Agricultural Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government should be promoted. In the patriotic high-yield movement of the past year, many high-yield experts have emerged in various places, creating many new high-yield records. For example, Qu Yaoli, a cotton planting expert from Jie County, Shanxi, created a new record of harvesting 830 jin of seed cotton per mu. This is more than eight times the current average yield of cotton fields per mu in our country. New records like these indicate infinitely broad prospects for increasing the yield per unit area of farmland. Promoting these new experiences will have a tremendous impact on China's agricultural production.

    It should be pointed out that no advanced experience can be universally accepted by the masses all at once. Advanced experience is produced after overcoming various conservative ideas and backward methods. Therefore, when promoting advanced experience, we must continue to struggle against conservative ideas and backward methods. Summarizing the masses' own experiences, and educating the masses with visible facts and benefits, is one of the most effective ways to promote advanced experience. It is hoped that all localities will give sufficient attention to this method of the Shanxi Agricultural Department.

### 推广先进的丰产经验

    推广先进的丰产经验
    用群众的经验教育群众，是我党最基本的领导方法。山西省人民政府农业厅日前向该省各专区、县、市发出“注意进行农业丰产调查”的通知，要求在全省范围内，广泛地进行一次丰产调查，以科学方法总结群众的丰产经验。用这些丰产经验与丰产实例，作为今年冬学和明年农业技术训练班的教材；山西省人民政府农业厅这种作法，是应该推广的。在一年来的爱国主义丰产运动中，各地都出现了不少丰产能手，创造了不少丰产新纪录。例如，山西解县植棉能手曲耀离创造的棉田单位面积产量每亩收获籽棉八百三十斤的新纪录。相当我国当前每亩棉田平均产量的八倍多。类似这样的新纪录，给提高农田单位面积产量，指出无限远大的前途。推广这些新的经验，将对我国的农业生产发生极大的影响。
    应该指出，任何先进经验，都不是一下子能为群众所普遍接受的。先进经验是战胜各种保守思想和落后办法以后产生出来的，因此，在推行先进经验时，必须继续与保守思想和落后办法作斗争。总结群众自己的经验，用看得见的事实与利益教育群众，是推广先进经验的最有效的办法之一，希望各地对于山西农业厅这种办法，加以足够的重视。
