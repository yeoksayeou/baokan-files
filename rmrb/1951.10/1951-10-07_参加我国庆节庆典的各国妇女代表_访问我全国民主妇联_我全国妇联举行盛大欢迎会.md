Deng Yingchao said: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation now connects over 76 million organized women. Deng Yingchao finally pointed out: Chinese women deeply cherish peace. If all brothers and sisters in Asia and around the world unite and resolutely defend the cause of peace to the end, peace will triumph over war.

Trofiminka, the female representative of the Soviet People's Delegation, said in her speech: The Soviet people and women love the Chinese people. We share weal and woe with the Chinese people and rejoice in the victory of the Chinese people. The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable. Soviet women will always stand together with women in people's democratic countries and democratic women in capitalist countries to defend peace and oppose warmongers!

Mrs. Hanna Sen, a female member of the Indian People's Delegation and President of the All-India Women's Conference, said in her speech: The experience of Chinese women's liberation struggle inspires Indian women. The common goal of Chinese and Indian women is to join hands and fight for peace. The close unity of Chinese and Indian women, expanding into the great unity of all Asian women and even the people of the world, is the best guarantee for defending peace.

Nguyen Thuc Vien, a female member of the Vietnamese People's Delegation and Vice-Chairperson of the Vietnamese Women's Union, said: Seeing Chinese women living a happy life today further increases the confidence of the Vietnamese people and women in driving the French imperialists out of Vietnamese territory.
