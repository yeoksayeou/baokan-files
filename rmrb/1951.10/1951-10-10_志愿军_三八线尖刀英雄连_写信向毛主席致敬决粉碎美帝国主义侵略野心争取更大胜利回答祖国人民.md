Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The "Three-Eight Line Sharp Knife Hero Company" of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to congratulate the National Day. The letter from the company stated:

　　Over the past year, we have learned the skills to defeat the American aggressors. We have discovered their weaknesses: fear of close combat, fear of night combat, fear of encirclement, fear of fierce charges, and fear of death. In the New Year offensive to break through the 38th parallel, we cooperated with fraternal units to break through the enemy's layers of defensive fortifications within twelve hours. Then, with lightning speed, we fought ten battles and continuously broke through the enemy's deep defense line of one hundred and fifty li, thrusting the sharp knife straight into the enemy's heart, the Gapyeong and Jiningri area on the north bank of the Han River, thereby coordinating with the main force to annihilate the main force of the puppet 2nd Division and puppet 5th Division in one fell swoop. In this battle, under the wise command of the higher authorities, our company annihilated two enemy companies and defeated the stubborn enemy, thus winning the glorious title of "Three-Eight Line Sharp Knife Hero Company" awarded by the higher authorities.

　　In the nearly one year of combat since entering Korea, our entire company has annihilated more than 750 enemies, captured 25 artillery pieces of various types, 501 various guns, 9 vehicles, and many other military supplies. Our combat effectiveness has been greatly improved. Thirty-four members of the company have been credited with meritorious service or higher, including six who have received military medals from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We clearly know that these victories are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party, the wise command of the higher authorities, and the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland. We hereby pay our respects to our beloved Chairman Mao and express our gratitude to the people of the motherland. At the same time, we will never be arrogant. We will strive for greater victories to live up to the expectations of the people of the motherland.

　　We know that there will be many difficulties in the war against American imperialist aggression, but we are not afraid at all. We resolutely express our determination to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland: in order to shatter the U.S. imperialists' ambition to occupy Korea, invade China, and dominate the world, and to strive for the complete realization of peace, we will fight the American aggressors to the end until the final victory is won.

    志愿军“三八线尖刀英雄连”
    写信向毛主席致敬
    决粉碎美帝国主义侵略野心争取更大胜利回答祖国人民
    【新华社七日讯】中国人民志愿军某部“三八线尖刀英雄连”写信给毛主席，祝贺国庆。该连的信上说：
    一年来，我们学会了打败美国侵略军的本领。我们摸到了他们怕近战、怕夜战、怕包围、怕猛冲、怕死的弱点。在突破三八线的新年攻势中，我们在十二小时内配合兄弟部队突破了敌人层层防御工事，接着以迅雷不及掩耳的动作，打了十仗，连续突破敌一百五十华里的纵深防御，把尖刀直插到敌人的心脏汉江北岸的加平、济宁里一带，从而配合主力，一举歼灭伪二师、伪五师主力。这次战斗中，在上级英明指挥下，我们连歼敌两个连，并打垮顽抗之敌，因而获得了上级奖给的“三八线尖刀英雄连”的光荣称号。
    入朝以来近一年的战斗中，我们全连共歼灭敌人七百五十多人，缴获各种炮二十五门，各种枪五百零一枝，汽车九辆，和其他许多军用品。我们的战斗力大大提高了，全连出现立了大功以上的功臣三十四名，其中有六个人获得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军功章。我们清楚知道，这些胜利与党的正确领导，上级的英明指挥，和祖国人民的热烈支援是分不开的，我们谨此向我们敬爱的毛主席致敬，向祖国人民致谢。同时，我们决不骄傲，我们要争取更大的胜利来回答祖国人民对我们的希望。
    我们知道，反对美帝国主义的侵略战争中，还会有许多困难，但我们毫不惧怕。我们坚决向毛主席和祖国人民表示决心：为粉碎美帝国主义占领朝鲜、进攻中国、霸占世界的野心，为争取和平的彻底实现，我们要和美国侵略军打到底，直到取得最后的胜利。
