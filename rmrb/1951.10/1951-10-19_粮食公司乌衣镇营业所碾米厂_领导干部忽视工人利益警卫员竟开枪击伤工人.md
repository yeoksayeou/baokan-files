    Grain Company's Wuyi Town Branch Rice Mill:
    Leading Cadres Neglect Workers' Interests, Guard Opens Fire and Wounds Worker
To the Editor:
    The China Grain Company's Chuxian Branch in Wuyi Town has neglected the interests of workers, causing a serious rift between the factory management and workers at the rice mill under its jurisdiction, even leading to an incident where a guard shot and wounded a worker.
    On the morning of July 29th, Hou Zhengji, an employee of the branch, went to the workers' dormitory and asked the workers to go to the warehouse to sew up sacks. Due to the poor attitude of both sides, a dispute arose. Worker Huang Kaiyuan went to the district government to report and request a resolution to the matter. Li Hengshu, a guard at the rice mill, went after Huang Kaiyuan with a gun, and Sun Guizhi, the guard squad leader, even encouraged him. Someone reported this to Zhang Jiazhen, the warehouse director, who said, "Don't interfere. The guard has his responsibilities when he carries a gun." Later, Factory Director Guo of the mill assured the district government that Huang Kaiyuan's safety would be guaranteed, after which Huang returned to the warehouse. Li Hengshu seized the opportunity to rush over with a gun and fired three shots, wounding Huang Kaiyuan. Chen Shikui, a soldier in the guard squad who came to stop him, was also wounded in the left arm.
    After the incident, the Wuyi District Government immediately arrested the assailant, Li Hengshu, and sent him to the Chuxian People's Court for legal proceedings. Local Party and government organs and relevant departments have reviewed the matter, and those responsible have been dealt with accordingly.
    We believe that the above situation is due to the fact that the head of the branch has consistently neglected the interests of the workers. For example, Guo Bingyuan, the director of the rice mill, and Zhang Jiazhen, the warehouse director, have consistently disrespected the workers and treated them with a purely employer-employee perspective. This spring, they arbitrarily dismissed more than 30 workers. Workers generally work 13 hours a day. The workers raised many criticisms of the factory leadership's mistakes and shortcomings, but the factory leaders not only did not adopt them, but also discriminated against and suppressed the workers, even to the point where a guard shot and wounded a worker. In order to thoroughly improve the work of the branch and its subordinate factories, we believe that we should start by improving leadership, strengthening worker solidarity, and enhancing political education.

    粮食公司乌衣镇营业所碾米厂
    领导干部忽视工人利益警卫员竟开枪击伤工人编辑同志：
    中国粮食公司滁县支公司乌衣镇营业所，忽视工人的利益，造成了该所碾米厂厂方与工人间的严重隔膜，甚至发生了警卫员枪伤工人的事件。
    七月二十九日早晨，该营业所职员侯正吉到工人宿舍，叫工人去库场缝补麻袋；因双方态度不好，争执起来。工人黄开元去区政府报告，请求处理这件事。碾米工厂警卫员李恒树持枪去追黄开元，警卫班班长孙桂之反鼓励他。当时有人向仓库主任张家珍报告这件事，张家珍竟说：“你们不要管，警卫员拿枪有他的责任。”之后，该厂郭厂长在区政府表示保证工人黄开元的安全后，黄回到库场。李恒树乘机持枪赶来，连发三枪，打伤黄开元。警卫班战士陈士开赶来阻挡，也伤了左臂。
    事件发生后，乌衣区政府即将凶手李恒树逮捕，送滁县人民法院法办。当地党政机关及有关部门对此事已进行检讨，有关肇事人员也都处理了。
    我们认为，上述情况是由于该营业所负责人一贯忽视工人利益所致。如碾米厂厂长郭炳元和仓库主任张家珍等人，一贯不尊重工人，用单纯的雇佣观点来使用工人，于今年春天曾随意解雇工人三十余人。工人一般工作时间每日达到十三小时。工人对工厂领导上的错误和缺点提出很多批评，该厂负责人不但不采纳，反而歧视和打击工人，竟至发生警卫员开枪打伤工人的事件。为彻底改进该营业所及其所属工厂的工作，我们认为应首先从改进领导，加强职工团结和政治教育着手。
