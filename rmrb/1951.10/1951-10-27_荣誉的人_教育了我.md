    "A Man of Honor" Educated Me
    To the Editor:
    After reading the article "A Man of Honor" published in the People's Daily on October 17th, I feel even more strongly that the heroes of the Volunteer Army are indeed the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and a model for the people of the motherland to learn from!
    The heroic deeds of Cui Jianguo's platoon deeply moved me and made me feel very ashamed. In my work, I am arrogant and complacent, look down on those who are not as good as me, and sometimes even envy others. How can this kind of individualistic ideology and work style be compared with the great spirit of the Volunteer Army heroes?
    "A Man of Honor" educated me and made me truly understand what honor is and what a hero is. I must learn from the example of the heroes, improve myself in all aspects, and dedicate myself to the cause of the Party.

    To the Editor:
    I finished reading the article "A Man of Honor" published in your newspaper with infinite admiration and excitement. The glorious combat deeds of Volunteer Army combat hero Comrade Cui Jianguo and all the soldiers in his platoon deeply moved me. Their love for the motherland, their sense of responsibility to the people of the world, and their hatred for the imperialist bandits inspired them to fight heroically and tenaciously, and to create such brilliant achievements. They are truly brave men, men of honor, and the most beloved people in the world!
    I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and "A Man of Honor" has educated me. I am determined to learn from the spirit of infinite loyalty of Cui Jianguo's platoon heroes to the motherland and the cause of the Party, as well as their noble revolutionary qualities. I will also learn from their spirit of seizing time, study hard, and become a cadre of New China with both ability and moral integrity and a strong physique in the future.

    “荣誉的人”教育了我编辑同志：
    读了十月十七日人民日报登载的“荣誉的人”一文后，我更加感到志愿军英雄们的确是中华民族的优秀儿女，是祖国人民学习的榜样！
    崔建国排的英雄事迹深深地感动了我，并使我自己感到十分惭愧。我在工作中骄傲自满，瞧不起不如自己的人，有时甚至还妒忌别人。这种个人主义的思想作风，怎能与志愿军英雄们的伟大精神相比拟呢？
    “荣誉的人”教育了我，使我真正地知道了荣誉是什么，英雄是什么，我一定要学习英雄们的榜样，在各方面提高自己，献身于党的事业。
    淄博总工会    刘宗岐编辑同志：
    我以无限崇敬和激动的心情，读完了贵报发表的“荣誉的人”一文。志愿军战斗英雄崔建国同志和他全排战士们光辉的战斗事迹，深深地感动了我。他们对祖国的热爱，对世界人民的责任感，与对帝国主义强盗的痛恨，鼓舞他们去英勇顽强地战斗，并创造这样辉煌的战绩。他们是真正勇敢的人、荣誉的人和世界上最可爱的人！
    我是一个青年团员，“荣誉的人”教育了我。我决心学习崔建国排英雄们对祖国及党的事业无限忠诚的精神与他们崇高的革命品质，并要学习他们争取时间的精神，努力学习，在将来做一个才德兼备与体魄强健的新中国的干部。
