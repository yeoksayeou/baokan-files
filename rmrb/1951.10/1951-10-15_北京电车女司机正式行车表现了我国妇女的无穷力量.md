    Beijing Women Tram Drivers Formally Driving Shows the Infinite Power of Chinese Women
    To the Editor:
    I was deeply moved and excited when I saw the news on the front page of the People's Daily on October 4th that "The First Group of Women Tram Drivers in Beijing Formally Began Driving!" I thought of the large number of women labor models that have emerged in various parts of the country since the founding of New China two years ago, and the great contributions of women across the country in various jobs; from this I deeply realized that the great and infinite power of Chinese women can only be fully发挥 in the brilliant Mao Zedong era.
    In the era of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, women had no freedom. They were cruelly oppressed and treated as playthings and slaves. Looking back on the past and comparing it with the present, how can we not sincerely thank Chairman Mao! He gave us such a free and happy life and opened up infinitely beautiful prospects for us.
                                            Zhang Yanhua

    北京电车女司机正式行车表现了我国妇女的无穷力量编辑同志：
    十月四日人民日报第一版登载了“北京市第一批电车女司机正式行车”的消息。我看到以后，心里有说不出的感动和兴奋！我联想到新中国建国两年以来各地出现的大批的妇女劳动模范，联想到全国广大妇女在各种工作上的巨大贡献；由此我深深地体会到：中国妇女伟大的无穷的力量，只有在光辉灿烂的毛泽东时代，才有充分发挥出来的可能。
    国民党反动派统治时代，妇女没有自由，她们被残酷地压迫，被当作玩物和奴隶。抚今追昔，我们怎能不衷心地感谢毛主席！他给了我们这样自由幸福的生活，为我们开辟了无限美好的前途。
