The Party Gave Me the Strength to Persist in Struggle!
Industrial Labor Model Liu Weizhen (oral account), Notes by Song Cheng

Last September, Beijing held the National Labor Model Representative Conference. At that time, our steel company had not yet undergone democratic reform, especially in our steelmaking department, where counter-revolutionaries and feudal foremen colluded to rule over the vast majority of workers and control the trade union. Every rationalization proposal I made was met with their obstruction and attacks. My production achievements were also attributed to others by these bad elements, and when it came to selecting model workers, they manipulated the election and sent one of their own to Beijing to attend the meeting. This year, these bad elements were struggled against in the democratic reform, and the workers became masters of their own house. I was elected by the employees of the five major factories and mines as a model to come to Beijing for the National Day celebrations. I think, if it weren't for the Party's cultivation, education, and leadership, I wouldn't have had the courage or the strength to persist in the struggle against the bad elements for two years; at the same time, without this year's democratic reform, righteousness would not have been able to overcome evil, and truth would not have been able to prevail.

In 1947, when I was working at a steel factory in Qingdao, an underground Party member told me every night why there were rich and poor in the world, why the poor worked and the rich enjoyed the fruits of their labor; he told me what the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army were; he told me to work hard to build the motherland after liberation. I remembered these words. In May 1949, as soon as our factory was liberated, I responded to the call of the military representative and actively tried to open the furnace for steelmaking (before liberation, the steelmaking department could not produce steel). But the feudal foreman Ge Shutong and others desperately attacked me. On June 18th, the military representative agreed to let me try smelting two furnaces of steel. When the steel was already smelted and the molten steel flowed into the steel ladle, Ge Shutong actually broke the steel ladle, causing the molten steel to spill completely on the ground. The workers were heartbroken. I was so upset that I couldn't even eat. I was determined to smelt again. This time it was successful, and two furnaces of steel produced thirty-six good steel ingots. Seeing these steel ingots, I was so happy I didn't know what to do. I knew that our country lacked steel. Seeing the restoration of railways and other industries, and the construction of national defense, steel was needed everywhere. I was thinking about the country day and night, trying to find ways to increase production. The number of steelmaking furnaces increased day by day. Every time steel was produced, I had to personally weigh it and carefully calculate how to increase production further. I constantly tried to improve tools, make rationalization proposals, and improve the work system. But almost every time, I was attacked and sabotaged by the bad elements. They scolded me for "kissing up, wanting to work the workers to death," said I was "boasting," and sarcastically said, "You'll work yourself to death, who will appreciate it? The factory isn't yours." When I raised steelmaking to eight furnaces a day, they sabotaged again, insisting that the temperature was not high enough, pouring the molten steel on the ground, and then holding a meeting to criticize me for arbitrarily increasing production. There's simply no end to these things. I was often so angry that I didn't know what to do, but I knew that if I was discouraged and stopped working, that would be exactly what they wanted. I often remembered what the comrade in Qingdao told me, and I also saw with my own eyes that the Communist Party was truly the working class's own party. Although the foremen in the factory attacked me, the military representative and the comrades of the Party committee supported and encouraged me, and educated me to unite the masses and do a good job in production. I wasn't discouraged at all. But I had to be more cautious. Every time I made a rationalization proposal, I put my heart and soul into it, thinking it over and over again, consulting the workers in our group, and doing careful experiments. Otherwise, even a slight mistake would be maliciously attacked by them in front of the masses. I was afraid they would sabotage production. Every day before going to bed, I would always go to the factory to check, and on rainy days, I would go to the factory several times a night. The more I did this, the more the foremen hated me. Once, I made a rationalization proposal to use a crane to knock the smelted steel ingots off the pans, which was faster and more labor-saving, and didn't damage the crane. I experimented with doing this, and it was successful. I was happy, but the worker traitor Chen Zesheng shouted loudly beside me, not allowing me to use the crane to knock them off, saying that this would damage the crane. At this time, I was so angry that I couldn't breathe, and with the usual hard work, my stomach blood vessels ruptured, and I vomited blood, fainting to the ground. The workers took me to the hospital, and my wife and children surrounded me and cried, complaining that I shouldn't have worked so hard, and that I might die. I felt very calm in my heart. I thought, how many Communist Party members shed blood and sacrificed themselves for the revolution, and I am only enjoying the blessings of revolutionary victory. Now, if I suffer a little injustice for the construction of the motherland, even if I die, it's nothing. After I got better, I paid more attention to production and protecting the factory. When the Labor Model Representative Conference was held last year, the feudal foremen manipulated it and wrote my rationalization proposals and the achievements of other workers on Feng Xuantai, who was related to them, allowing him to go to Beijing to attend the meeting and meet Chairman Mao. Feng Xuantai even angered me before he left, saying, "I'm going to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao, but you can't go." I wasn't angry about this. I just felt that I hadn't done enough for the country. The martyrs gave their lives for the revolution, so I shouldn't slack off. Some workers felt wronged because their achievements were taken by Feng, so I persuaded them, "We shouldn't be greedy for merit. If we are greedy for merit, we are not proletarian, and we are not truly for the motherland. Now that evil is suppressing righteousness, this is inevitable. The Party and the higher-ups will know about us." After Feng Xuantai went to Beijing, I quickly improved three more tools. In October, I honorably joined the Communist Party. So far, I have made fifteen rationalization proposals. Just counting the nine items such as improving the Bessemer converter furnace, I have increased the country's wealth by more than 2.6 billion yuan. Our production has increased by 146 times compared to the early days of liberation.

This spring, our factory suppressed counter-revolutionary elements. In May, we launched the democratic reform movement. The Party organization asked us to mobilize the masses to collect materials. So I and Peng Huafei, an activist from another group, tried to mobilize the masses. We looked for honest workers who had been oppressed by the foremen, and mobilized everyone to pour out their grievances and network. Gradually, we united a large number of activists. After the general public accused Ge Shutong of his crimes, they also became active. We also won over the coerced elements and isolated the foremen. After initially reorganizing the team, we conducted a real democratic election and elected our own employee representative meeting. I got the most votes and was elected as the vice-chairman of the representative meeting. At this time, things that had been concealed by the foremen in the past were clarified, and righteousness prevailed. All the workers in our factory are thinking about how to increase production and reduce costs. In the past, we were able to increase production even when the foremen attacked and sabotaged us. Now that we are all elated, I believe we will produce more and better steel for the country!

    党给了我坚持斗争的力量！
    工业劳动模范  刘维振口述  宋  琤笔记
    去年九月间，北京在开全国劳动模范代表会议。那时候我们钢铁公司还没有进行民主改革，特别是在我们炼钢部里，反革命分子和封建把头勾结起来统治着绝大多数的工人，并且掌握了工会。我每提出一个合理化建议，都要受到他们的阻碍和打击。我在生产上的成绩也被这些坏蛋们写在别人头上，在评选模范时，他们操纵着选举了一个他们自己的人到北京来开了会。今年，这些坏蛋们在民主改革中被斗争了，工人们当了家作了主，我被五大厂矿的职工选为模范来北京观礼。我想，要不是党对我的培养教育和领导，我就没有勇气也没有力量和坏蛋们坚持斗争两年；同时，要没有今年的民主改革，正气还是压不倒邪气，真理也不能抬头。
    一九四七年我在青岛某钢铁厂作工时，一位地下党员天天夜晚对我讲天下为什么有穷有富，为什么穷人做工富人享福；对我讲什么是共产党和解放军；要我解放后努力建设祖国。我记住了这些话。一九四九年五月，我们厂一解放，我就响应军代表的号召，积极想法开炉炼钢（解放前炼钢部不能出钢）。但是封建把头葛树桐等拼命地打击我。六月十八号，军代表同意我试炼两炉钢。当钢已经炼好，钢水流进钢包时，葛树桐竟然把钢包弄破，使钢水完全打翻在地下。工友们都心痛得没法。我难过得饭也吃不下去。我决心再炼。这一次成功了，两炉钢出了三十六条很好的钢锭子。看见这些钢锭子，我高兴得不知怎么是好。我知道咱们的国家缺少钢铁，眼看着恢复铁路和其他工业，建设国防，到处需要钢铁，我白天黑夜都在替祖国打算，想办法提高生产。炼钢的炉数一天天增加了，每次钢出炉我都要亲自过磅，仔细计算着再增加生产。我不断地设法改良工具，提合理化建议，改进工作制度。但是几乎没有一次不被坏蛋们打击破坏的。他们骂我“拍马屁，想把工人都累死”，说我“吹牛”，讽刺我说：“累死你，谁知你的情，工厂又不是你的。”当我把炼钢提高到每日八炉时，他们又进行破坏，硬说温度不够，把钢水倒在地下，然后开会斗争我，说我随便增加生产。这些事简直是说不完的。我也常常被气得没办法，可是我知道，我要是被他们整得泄气不干了，那才正如他们的意。我常想起青岛那位同志告诉我的话，我也亲眼看到共产党真正是工人阶级自己的党。厂里的把头们虽然打击我，可是军代表和党委会的同志都支持我鼓励我，教育我好好团结群众搞好生产。我一点也不泄气。但是我得更谨慎小心。每提一个合理化建议，我都是用尽心血，翻三覆四地想了又想，请教我们组里的工友，仔细做试验，不然，稍有一点差错，还要被他们在群众中恶意攻击。我怕他们破坏生产。每天临睡前总得上工厂查看一遍，下雨天一夜我总要上厂查看几次。越是这样，把头们越恨我。有一次我提了一个合理化建议，用吊车把炼好的钢锭从盘子上碰撞下来，这样又快又省力，也不损害吊车。我试验着这样做，结果搞成功了，我正在高兴，工贼陈泽生却在旁边大叫大喊，不准我用吊车碰，说这样要把吊车弄坏。这时气得我气都不能出来，加上平时的劳累，以致胃血管破裂，大口吐起血来，晕倒在地上。工友们把我送到医院去，老婆孩子都围着我哭，埋怨我不该那样拼命，落得死活不保。我心里倒很平静。我想，多少共产党员为革命流血牺牲受委屈，我才享到革命胜利的福。现在为建设祖国我受点屈就是死了也不算啥。病好了我就更加注意生产和保护工厂。去年开劳动模范代表会议时，封建把头操纵着，把我的合理化建议和别的工友的功绩都写在和他们有关系的冯宣泰的身上，让他到北京开会见毛主席。冯宣泰临走时还气我说：“我要去北京见毛主席了，你可是不能去了。”我并不为此生气，我只是觉得，我为国家干的还太少，先烈们为革命连性命都不要了，我不好好干对不起他们。有几个工友因为自己的功绩被冯占去而觉得抱委屈，我就劝他们说：“我们不贪功，贪功劳就不是无产阶级，就不是真心为祖国。现在邪气压着正气，这样是难免的，党和上级会知道咱们的。”我在冯宣泰进京后，很快地又改进了三样工具。就在十月里我光荣地参加了共产党，到现在为止，我已提了十五件合理化建议，仅就改进贝氏炉炉膛等九件算，已经为国家增加了二十六亿多元的财富。我们的生产比初解放时已提高
    一百四十六倍。
    今年春天，我们厂里镇压了反革命分子。五月又展开了民主改革运动。党组织要我们发动群众搜集材料。我就和另一组的积极分子彭华飞设法发动群众。我们找那些受把头欺压的老实工友，发动大家诉苦，串连，慢慢地就团结了大批积极分子，一般群众在控诉了葛树桐的罪恶后也积极起来了。我们又争取了胁从分子，孤立了把头。初步整顿了队伍后，我们进行了真正的民主选举，选出了自己的职工代表会。我得到了最多的票数，当选为代表会的副主席。这时候过去被把头们蒙蔽的事情都搞清楚了，正气抬了头。我们全厂的工友都在想法再来提高生产，降低成本。过去有把头打击破坏，我们还能够提高生产，现在都扬眉吐气了，我相信一定会给国家生产更多的更好的钢铁！
