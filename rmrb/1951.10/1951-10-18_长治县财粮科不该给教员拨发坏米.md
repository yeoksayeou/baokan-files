    Changzhi County Finance and Food Department Should Not Allocate Bad Rice to Teachers
    Editor:
    In September, we received an investigation report from the Changzhi County Education Union regarding the allocation of rotten rice to teachers in the third and sixth districts by the Changzhi County Finance and Food Department. The details are as follows: On August 10th, the Changzhi County Finance and Food Department allocated rice for the July and August salaries of teachers in one go, of which more than 32,000 jin received by the third and sixth districts was all bad rice. The teachers of the two districts elected Shen Weicheng as a representative to negotiate with the County Finance and Food Department, but Deputy Section Chief Liu of the department said: "The province stipulates that teachers receive local grain, and this kind of rice is the local grain, it cannot be exchanged; if you don't come to collect it now, it will rot completely in two months and it will still be yours. If you don't collect it by December, it will be frozen." Because the teachers had not received rice for two months and were having financial difficulties, they had to take the bad rice back. However, because the millet was too moldy, it was neither edible nor easy to sell, which caused the teachers great distress. For example, students at Donghe Third Complete Primary School were unwilling to eat with the teachers; when Yang Zhihong, the principal of Kansi Village Central School, carried the rice to the cooperative to pay his debts, he was also rejected. He carried it to other villages to sell it several times, but he couldn't sell it. Because the teachers had to carry the bad rice around to sell, it affected their teaching work. Regarding this issue, the county education union has repeatedly raised opinions with the Finance and Food Department and the Culture and Education Department, but no reasonable solution has been obtained.
    In addition, recently, the phenomenon of allocating bad rice to teachers has also occurred continuously in more than ten counties including Anyi, Xiaxian, Guoxian, and Xinxian.

    Editor's Note: The practice of the Changzhi County Finance and Food Department allocating rotten rice to primary school teachers is wrong; it should quickly find ways to remedy the situation to ensure the lives of the people's teachers; and it should make a deep self-criticism in the newspaper.

### 长治县财粮科不该给教员拨发坏米

    长治县财粮科不该给教员拨发坏米编辑同志：
    我们在九月间接到长治县教育工会关于长治县财粮科给三、六两区教员拨发烂米的调查报告。事情的经过如下：八月十日，长治县财粮科一次拨发了七、八月份教员工资米，其中三、六两区所领的三万二千余斤米，全是坏米。两区教师推选申维成代表全区教师，与县财粮科交涉，但该科刘副科长说：“省里规定教员领地方粮，地方粮就是这种米，不能调换；如果现在不来领取，再搁两个月米烂透了也是你们的。要是在十二月不领，就要冻结。”教师们因为两个月没有领米，生活困难，只得将坏米领回。可是小米因霉烂得太厉害，既不能吃，也不好卖，教师们为此非常苦恼。如东和第三完全小学学生就不愿和教师一起搭伙；看寺村中心学校校长杨志宏同志背上米去合作社还账时，也被拒绝了。他背到别的村去卖了几次，也没卖掉。教师们因为要背上坏米东糶西卖，影响了教学工作。关于这个问题，该县教育工会曾再三向财粮科、文教科提出意见，但终未得到合理解决。
    此外，最近在安邑、夏县、崞县、忻县等十余县，亦不断发生给教员拨发坏米的现象。
                中国教育工会山西省委员会
    编者按：长治县财粮科给小学教员拨发烂米的作法是错误的；应该迅速设法补救，以保证人民教师的生活；并应在报上作深刻检讨。
