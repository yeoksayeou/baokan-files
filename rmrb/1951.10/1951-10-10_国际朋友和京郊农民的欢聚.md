A Joyful Gathering of International Friends and Farmers from the Outskirts of Beijing
By our reporter Zǐ Gāng
    Forty-two international friends who participated in our National Day celebrations visited five villages in the outskirts of Beijing on October 8th, fully demonstrating "People of the world are of one heart."

    The five villages they visited were: Liulangzhuang, Huangtugang Village, Xiaohongmen Village, Luquan Village, and Baiyanzhuang. These can be said to be five ordinary villages in the outskirts of Beijing after the land reform. However, they allowed representatives from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries to see the infinitely bright future of Chinese farmers and to love the Chinese farmers as if they were their own brothers. Representatives from India and Burma, on the other hand, said with envy to the Chinese farmers: You are our banner. Our farmers are much more miserable than you. Thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership in China, the people of Asia have hope. The young village chief of Liulangzhuang said to the Indian representative: We hope the Indian people can live a good life like us.

    Gustā Fučíková, the wife of Julius Fučík, author of "Report from the Gallows," said: If representatives from capitalist countries were to see your countryside, they would certainly criticize and say: It's too poor. But we have a different view. This is because China was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country in the past, and it has been exploited and oppressed by feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and imperialism for too long. It is not surprising at all. However, today the Chinese farmers are already free, and I can see the joy in their hearts. Our farmers in the Carpathian Mountains were also very poor before the Soviet army liberated them.

    M. A. Marinina, chairman of the "October 12th" collective farm in Kostroma Oblast, Soviet Union, is truly a shining banner for farmers worldwide. She worked as a pasture owner for seventeen years and is now the chairman of a collective farm, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, has been awarded four Orders of Lenin, and has received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and the Stalin Prize. In Baiyanzhuang, she reported on the modern equipment of Soviet collective farms, where farmers ride cars into the city, the level of cultural life has improved, and the distinction between urban and rural areas is gradually disappearing.

    "How happy I am to have the opportunity to see the diligent and brave people of China, and I congratulate you on greater achievements in production. Soon your life will be as happy as ours!"

    The Soviet representative asked the children of Baiyanzhuang: What message do you want to bring to the Soviet children?

    A fourteen-year-old child said: May they study hard! When the Polish representative also asked him for a few words to pass on to the Polish children, he said: Don't be superstitious, don't be feudal.

    The child's unintentional words greatly impressed the head of the Polish delegation. "Our farmers are not as easy to deal with as your farmers. If you tell them not to believe in Buddha, they will turn the temples into schools. Our farmers are very stubborn in their religious beliefs."

    Some children in the countryside said they could recognize twenty characters a day, some said they wanted to drive tractors when they grew up, and others said vaguely that they wanted to serve the people, which amused the guests. The number of school-age children in each village has generally more than doubled since liberation. Take Luquan Village Primary School as an example! Previously, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for only 8%, but now they account for 48%.

    When Fučíková heard that half of the students in the Luquan Village school were women, she put down her notebook and applauded first. She was also so happy when she heard that the poor and lower-middle peasants had become the masters of the land.

    Each village invited the guests to eat dumplings, some with side dishes. Wu Lianming, a member of the Communist Youth League in Luquan Village, used to work as a temporary laborer before liberation, but after liberation, he added a house and had land. Last year, he used a bridal sedan to bring back a freely married wife during the twelfth lunar month. On this day, he bought ten pounds of beef for the dumpling filling, and the family of six was busy all night, and at noon they treated the guests to dumplings.

    Lunch was eaten under a gourd trellis. Large round gourds of light green hung down leisurely. The guests looked at them and then, playing with the water ladle on the water tank, smiled understandingly. Fat cabbages were planted in front of the house. When the forum was held, the guests enjoyed boiled peanuts, corn, and sweet potatoes. Finally, each delegation took back a large pile of agricultural products, along with a large gourd with inscriptions. The guests said: "We must take these gifts back to let our people know your hard work. We must continue to fight against imperialism and not allow them to interfere with and hinder our good life."

    Wu Lianming can stand up and testify. His new house is bright and clean, which has won the praise of the guests. More than fifty new houses have been added in their village in the past year.

    The Korean representative went to Baiyanzhuang for a while, and returned to the city in advance due to urgent matters. Before leaving, he solemnly entrusted the village chief: Take good care of the families of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the village. Representatives from Eastern Europe said to the family members of two soldiers who went to resist the US and aid Korea: You have not only defended yourselves, but also defended us. World peace is indivisible, so please accept our respect and gratitude.

    Ten representatives from Bulgaria, Poland, and Germany held a conference with more than a thousand farmers in Xiaohongmen Village. The Polish representative gave a short report. When he went back to step into the car, he shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" in Chinese. The general representatives also learned to use "Thank you" and "Good." Badges of youth and women's organizations from various countries were hung on the clothes of male and female farmers in the five villages. In some villages, the hosts and guests sang "The East is Red" together.

    Many of the representatives are reporters or rural workers. They inquired in detail about the operation of the cooperative, the types of crops in the countryside, the planting plan, and the breeding of livestock... Some female representatives wanted to see the facilities of the nursery. The farmers who have been emancipated and have added mules and carts have a glimmer in their eyes, and they point this and that to the guests with a smile, meaning: "Dear friends, we will become richer year by year. Chairman Mao has only led us in land reform for more than a year!" Indeed, every old peasant woman will summarize to the guests that the reason why they no longer go hungry and have built up their families after the harvest is: Chairman Mao has come, and the Communist Party has come.

    A village chief reported: People are no longer bullied, and the enthusiasm for patriotism has also come. When our village talked about donating airplanes and artillery, everyone decided to contribute 20 million, and it was collected in less than three days.

    Cao Yongsheng, an old farmer from Liulangzhuang, was also on the cover of the People's Pictorial because he is a model worker. The cover picture of his smiling face holding wheat ears is framed and he introduced to the guests: "This is me!"

    Rachelanu, the head of the Romanian delegation, is the vice chairman of the Romanian Democratic Women's Federation. She is very talkative. She hugged a rural girl and touched her cheeks. Looking from behind, one was wrapped in a colorful silk scarf and the other was a white towel. They smiled at each other, as if saying: We are far apart geographically, but the purpose of the struggle is the same. You know me, and I know you.

    Happiness is growing like a calf. The representatives from various countries saw the green land and blue sky of Beijing in autumn, and also saw the infinitely beautiful future of Chinese farmers.

    国际朋友和京郊农民的欢聚
    本报记者    子冈
    四十二位参加我国国庆节的国际朋友在十月八日分头访问京郊五个村庄，充分表现了“全世界人民心一条”。
    他们去的五个村庄是：六郎庄、黄土岗村、小红门村、鹿圈村、和柏彦庄，可以说是土地改革以后京郊的普通五村，但是它们使得苏联及人民民主国家的代表们看出了中国农民无限美好的前景，把中国农民们当作亲兄弟们似地喜爱；而印、缅代表呢，又欣羡地对中国农民说：你们是我们的旗帜，我们的农民比你们苦得多，由于有了毛主席在中国的领导，亚洲人民有了希望。六郎庄的年轻村长对印度代表说：希望印度人民和我们一样过好日子。
    “绞索套着脖子时的报告”的作者伏契克的夫人古丝妲·伏契克娃说：假如是资本主义国家代表来看你们的农村，他们一定会挑眼地说：太穷苦了，但是我们有另外一种看法，这是由于中国过去是半封建半殖民地的国家，受封建主义，官僚资本主义、帝国主义的剥削压迫太久了，一点也不足为奇的。可是，今天中国的农民们已经自由了，我看得出他们心里的喜悦，我们喀尔巴阡山上的农民在苏军解放前也是十分困苦的。
    苏联科斯托洛玛州“十月十二”集体农庄主席玛里宁娜，真是全世界农民光辉的旗帜。她作过十七年牧场主人，现在又是农庄主席，俄罗斯联邦共和国最高苏维埃代表，身上挂了四个列宁勋章，得过社会主义劳动英雄称号和斯大林奖金。她在柏彦庄报告了苏联集体农庄的现代化设备，农民坐了汽车进城，文化生活水平提高，城市和乡村的区别已在逐渐消灭。
     “我多么高兴，有机会看到中国勤劳勇敢的人民，祝贺你们在生产上更大的成就，不久你们的生活就会像我们一样幸福的！”
    苏联代表问柏彦庄的小朋友：你要带什么话给苏联小朋友呢？
    一个十四岁的孩子说：愿他们好好学习！当波兰代表也向他要几句话，想捎给波兰小朋友时，他却说：不要迷信，不要封建。
    这孩子无意中说的话，却使得波兰代表团团长十分折服。“我们的农民不像你们的农民那么好办，说不信佛，就把庙宇来办学校，我们的农民对宗教信仰固执得很呢。”
    农村孩子们有的说一天能认二十个字，有的说大了要开拖拉机，又有的笼统地说要为人民服务，把客人们逗笑了。普遍的每村学龄儿童在解放以后加了一倍以上，例如鹿圈村小学吧！以前贫雇农子女只占百分之八，而如今占了百分之四十八。
    伏契克娃听到鹿圈村民校学生妇女占一半时，她放下笔记本首先鼓掌，听到贫雇农们作了土地的主人时也是如此欢欣。
    每个村庄请客人们吃饺子，有的外加小菜。鹿圈村的青年团员吴连明解放以前给人打短工，解放以后添盖了住屋，有了土地。去年腊月用花轿抬来了自由结婚的媳妇。这一天买了十斤牛肉作馅包饺子，一家六口忙了一宵，中午招待客人吃饺子。
    午饭是在葫芦棚下吃的，一个个淡翠色的大圆葫芦垂挂得悠然有致，客人看看它，一壁把玩水缸上的水瓢，才领悟地笑了笑。房子前面种的肥肥的大白菜。当开座谈会的时候，客人享用了煮花生，玉米和甜薯。末了每个代表团抱回一大堆农产品，外带一个镌了字的大葫芦。客人们说：“我们一定要把这些礼物带回去，让我们的人民知道你们的勤劳。我们要继续与帝国主义作斗争，不许他们来干涉和妨碍我们的好日子。”
    吴连明可以站出来作证明的，他的新房窗明几净，得到客人的赞扬。他们村上一年来添盖了五十多间新屋子。
    朝鲜代表到柏彦庄去了一下，有事先回城，他临走郑重地嘱托村长：要好好照顾村中志愿军的家属。东欧代表对一家有两个儿子去抗美援朝的军属说：你们不只保卫了自己，也保卫了我们，世界和平是不可分的，所以请接受我们的敬意和感谢。
    保加利亚、波兰、德国的十个代表在小红门村和
    一千多农民群众开了大会，波兰代表作了一个短短的报告，他回去跨进汽车的时候，还用中国话喊了“毛主席万岁！”一般的代表也学会了应用“谢谢”和“好”。各国的青年及妇女团体的徽章在五个村子里挂上男女农民的衣襟。在有的村子里宾主一同唱“东方红”。
    代表中不少是记者或农村工作者。他们详细询问合作社的经营、农村的作物种类和耕种计划、牲口的繁殖………有的女代表想看看托儿所的设备。已经添了骡子和大车的翻身农民眼睛里闪着光辉，笑着对客人指这指那，意思说：“亲爱的朋友，我们会一年年富足起来的，毛主席领导我们土地改革才一年多呀！”真是的，每一位老农妇都会向客人归结不再挨饿、打了粮食兴了家的原因是：毛主席过来了，共产党过来了。
    一位村长报告说：人不受欺，爱国主义的劲头也来了。咱村子一说捐献飞机大炮，大伙儿决定出两千万，不到三天就凑齐了。
    六郎庄的老农民曹永盛还上过人民画报的封面呢，因为他是劳动模范，那张手拿麦穗的笑脸的封面画被装在镜框里，他介绍给客人说：“这就是我呀！”
    罗马尼亚代表团团长拉契亚努是罗国民主妇联副主席，十分健谈，她和一个农村少女相抱，贴了贴脸颊，从后面望去，一个包的是彩色绸巾，一个是白毛巾，她们相对笑着，好像说：我们在地域上离得很远，而斗争的目的是一个，你知道我，我也知道你啊。
    幸福就像小犊儿似地在生长。各国代表们望见了地绿天蓝的北京的秋天，也望见了中国农民无限美好的远景。
