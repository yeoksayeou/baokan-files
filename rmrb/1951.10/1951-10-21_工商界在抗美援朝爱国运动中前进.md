In the past year, under the enlightenment of patriotic ideological education for resisting America and aiding Korea, industrialists and businessmen across the country, together with people from all walks of life, have enthusiastically participated in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and Defend-the-Homeland movement with various practical actions.

On November 30, 1950, more than 40,000 industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin took the lead in holding a righteous anti-American patriotic parade. Following the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin, more than one million industrialists and businessmen in large, medium, and small cities across the country also held grand demonstrations and parades. The mobilization and enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial circles in various places during the Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and Defend-the-Homeland parades and demonstrations were unprecedented.

In order to further deepen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea patriotic movement and defend the motherland with practical work, industrialists and businessmen in various places widely signed patriotic covenants. According to statistics at the end of May, in Shanghai alone, more than 60,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in more than 200 industries, and in Beijing, more than 20,000 households in more than 130 industries, consciously signed patriotic covenants. Due to the signing of patriotic covenants, industrialists and businessmen in various places have achieved great success in fulfilling tax payment tasks, assisting the government in stabilizing prices, and improving operations. For example, when paying business income tax for 1950, industrialists and businessmen in Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan, and other places organized collective tax payment parades of thousands or even tens of thousands of people. In Yingkou City, Northeast China, the industrial and commercial circles completed the collective payment of industrial and commercial income tax for the first quarter of this year in four hours. In Zhuqiao Town, Nanhui, Southern Jiangsu, there was a moving scene of industrialists and businessmen lining up, beating gongs and drums, and running more than ten miles to the county seat to pay taxes. With the correct leadership of the People's Government and the conscious assistance of the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai, Wuhan, Wuxi, Shenyang, and other places, prices did not fluctuate during the Spring Festival this year, breaking the decades-old Chinese custom of "not buying goods in the twelfth lunar month even with money." In terms of completing processing and ordering tasks and improving operations, many industrialists and businessmen have corrected the bad habits of cutting corners and established a new style of industrialists and businessmen. In many places, industrialists and businessmen launched heated criticisms and self-criticisms while ensuring the implementation of patriotic covenants. Some also supervised each other. For example, Zhang Qingjun, manager of Heyizhai in Beijing, voluntarily produced false accounts when paying taxes; in order to prevent omissions in issuing delivery notes, the grain industry in Chaoyangmen Vegetable Market voluntarily organized a three-person interlocking group to supervise each other and be responsible to customers. These all show that the industrialists and businessmen in our country have made leaping progress after undergoing patriotic education for resisting America and aiding Korea.

In the movement to donate airplanes and cannons, industrial and commercial circles in various places have achieved great results. Up to now, the number of aircraft pledged by the industrial and commercial circles in the ten major cities across the country accounts for approximately 66.2 percent of the total number pledged by people from all walks of life in those cities. On the eve of National Day, industrial and commercial circles in various places launched a movement to pay ahead of schedule and complete donation tasks ahead of schedule. For example, the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Promotion Committee of the industrial and commercial circles in Wuxi City, Southern Jiangsu District, held a donation radio rally at the Southern Jiangsu People's Broadcasting Station on September 19. Within two hours of the radio rally, more than 100 industries in the city called or wrote to the radio station, unanimously expressing their response to the call to complete the donation plan ahead of schedule. The rally received 24.594412 billion yuan in donations from various industries on the spot. The industrial and commercial circles in Suzhou City, which was holding a symposium, heard the radio broadcast of the rally and made a long-distance call to the industrial and commercial circles in Wuxi City to challenge them to a competition. The challenge condition was not only to complete the original plan to donate 15 billion yuan ahead of schedule, but also to increase the donation by 4.6 billion yuan. Industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Zhengzhou, and other places have successively held collective payment rallies. The payment competition proposed by the Wuhan industrial and commercial circles is being enthusiastically responded to by industrial and commercial circles in various places.

Currently, industrial and commercial circles in various places are continuing to actively pay to welcome the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to fight abroad. Following the "Welcome National Day, Increase Production, Donate, and Collective Delivery Parade" held on September 28, the Beijing industrial and commercial circles convened a representative meeting of various industries and vendors on October 17, deciding to support the volunteer heroes who are bravely fighting the American aggressors on the Korean front with practical actions such as thoroughly checking the implementation of patriotic covenants and completing more than 75 percent of the payment task for the half-year donation plan before October 25. The Xi'an industrial and commercial circles decided to complete the plan to donate ten fighter planes for half a year before October 25 and to increase the donation of a "Volunteer Heroes" fighter plane to welcome the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to fight abroad.

    工商界在抗美援朝爱国运动中前进
     潘林
    一年以来，全国各地工商业者在抗美援朝的爱国主义思想教育的启发下，和全国各阶层人民在一起，以各种实际行动热烈地参加了抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    一九五○年十一月三十日，天津市四万余工商业人士首先举行了正义的反美爱国大游行。继天津工商界之后，全国各地大中小城镇共百余万工商业者也先后举行了盛大的示威游行。各地工商界在举行抗美援朝保家卫国的游行示威运动时，其动员之广、情绪之热烈是前所未有的。
    各地工商业者为了进一步深入开展抗美援朝爱国运动，以实际工作来保卫祖国，广泛订立了爱国公约。据五月底的材料统计，仅上海就有二百多个行业的六万多工商企业单位、北京有一百三十多个行业的二万多户自觉地签订了爱国公约。由于爱国公约的订立，各地工商业者在执行纳税任务、协助政府稳定物价、改善经营等方面，获得了很大的成绩。例如在缴纳一九五○年的营业所得税时，重庆、上海、北京、南京、武汉等地的工商界人士，都组织了数千人以至数万人的集体纳税大游行。东北营口市工商界在四小时内，全市一百零六个行业全部完成了今年第一季度工商所得税集体缴纳任务。苏南南汇祝桥镇工商界出现了排成队伍敲锣打鼓跑十多里路到县城纳税的动人场面。上海、武汉、无锡、沈阳等地工商界在人民政府正确领导以及工商界的自觉协助下，使今年春节物价没有波动，打破了中国几十年来的“有钱不买腊月货”的惯例。在完成加工订货任务、改善经营方面，有不少工商业者改正了以往偷工减料的恶习气，建立起工商业者的新作风。许多地方的工商业者在保证执行爱国公约时，热烈展开了批评和自我批评。有的并相互监督。如北京市合义斋经理张清浚在缴纳税款时，自动拿出假账；朝阳门菜市粮食业为防止漏开发货票，他们自动组织三人的连环小组，互相监督，对顾客负责。这些都说明了我国工商业者在经过抗美援朝爱国主义教育后，已经有了飞跃的进步。
    在捐献飞机大炮运动中，各地工商界有很大成绩。到目前止，全国十大城市工商界认捐的飞机数约占各该城市各界人民认捐总数百分之六十六点二。在国庆节前夕，各地工商界纷纷发动了提前交款、提前完成捐献任务的运动。如苏南区无锡市工商界抗美援朝推进委员会，于九月十九日在苏南人民广播电台举行捐献广播大会，该市工商界在举行广播大会的二小时内，即有一百多个行业打电话或写信到广播电台，一致表示响应号召提早完成捐献计划，大会当场收到各行业缴纳的献款二百四十五亿九千四百十二万元。正在开座谈会的苏州市工商界，听到大会广播，特地打长途电话向无锡市工商界应战竞赛。应战挑战条件是不仅提前完成原计划捐献一百五十亿元，并增加捐献四十六亿元。上海、天津、沈阳、郑州等地工商界都相继举行了集体缴款大会。由武汉工商界提出的缴款竞赛，各地工商界正在热烈响应。
    目前各地工商界正继续以积极缴款来迎接中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年纪念。北京市工商界继九月二十八日举行了“迎接国庆增产捐献集体纳库大游行”之后，又在十月十七日召开了各行业、各摊商代表大会，决定以深入检查爱国公约的执行情况、在十月二十五日前完成半年捐献计划百分之七十五以上的缴款任务等实际行动，支援正在朝鲜前线英勇打击美国侵略军的志愿军英雄们。西安市工商界决定在十月二十五日前完成半年捐献十架战斗机的计划，并增献“志愿军英雄号”战斗机一架，来迎接中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年。
