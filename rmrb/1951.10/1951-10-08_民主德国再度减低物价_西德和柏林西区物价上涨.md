Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th: On the eve of the second anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the government of the German Democratic Republic announced a further reduction in prices starting October 8, and the abolition of the rationing system for certain foods and consumer goods. The rationing system for all textiles made of artificial fibers, jams, artificial honey, etc., will be abolished, and these goods will still be sold at the original rationed prices. In state-owned stores, the prices of textiles made of cotton or rayon, for which the rationing system has not been abolished, will be reduced by an average of 20 to 30 percent. In state-owned wholesale trade, in stores selling goods without rationing, in cooperatives, and in small private stores, the prices of various textiles will be reduced by 15 to 30 percent.

    The Deputy Minister of Commerce and Supply of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Bend, gave a speech at a press conference on the 5th regarding this new decision, stating that everyone knows the measures taken by the German Democratic Republic since its founding two years ago to improve the people's living standards, namely: consecutive reductions in the prices of manufactured goods and food; the abolition of rationing for most textiles and bread and biscuits; reduction of taxes; increase of pensions; increase of wages for workers and staff; abolition of debts for small and middle peasants, and loans to them; assistance to immigrants; vigorous improvement of the material living conditions of intellectuals and assistance to young people. All of this has made the lives of our people more fulfilling.

    In contrast to the continuous reduction of prices in the German Democratic Republic, prices in West Germany and West Berlin under the occupation of American, British, and French imperialism are constantly rising. The Bonn government has decided to increase sugar prices from October 1. The prices of many textiles in West Germany have increased by 5 percent since October 1. The West Berlin Municipal Government Statistics Bureau admits that prices in West Berlin rose again in the second half of September.

    民主德国再度减低物价
    西德和柏林西区物价上涨
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：在德意志民主共和国成立两周年的前夕，德意志民主共和国政府宣布在十月八日起再度减低物价，并取消若干食物和消费品的配给制度。一切用人造纤维制成的纺织品、果酱、人造蜜等的配给制度都予以取消，这些货物仍按原来的配给价格出售。在国营商店中，没有取消配给制度的用棉纤维或人造丝制成的纺织品的价格，将平均减少百分之二十到三十。在国营批发贸易中，在出售没有配给制度的商品的商店中，在合作社以及私营小商店中，各种纺织品的价格将减少百分之十五到三十。
    德意志民主共和国商务与供应部副部长本德五日在记者招待会上就这项新决定发表谈话称，每个人都知道德意志民主共和国成立两年以来所采取的提高人民生活水准的措施，这就是：接连减低制成品和食物的价格，取消大多数纺织品和面包饼干的配给制度；减低捐税；增加养老金；增加工人和职员的工资；废除小农和中农的债务，并且贷款给他们；协助移民；大力改善知识分子的物质生活条件以及援助青年。这一切都使我们人民的生活更加美满。
    和德意志民主共和国物价不断减低的情况相反，美英法帝国主义占领下的西德和柏林西区的物价却在不断上涨，波恩政府已决定自十月一日起提高食糖价格。西德许多纺织品的价格自十月一日起已上涨百分之五。柏林西区市政府统计局承认，柏林西区的物价在九月份下半月又上涨了。
