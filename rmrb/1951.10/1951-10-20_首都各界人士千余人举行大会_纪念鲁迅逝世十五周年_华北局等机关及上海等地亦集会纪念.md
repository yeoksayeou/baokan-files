Xinhua News Agency Report: People from all walks of life in the capital and Shanghai solemnly commemorated the 15th anniversary of the death of China's great writer and ideological warrior, Lu Xun, on the 19th.

The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and other relevant agencies and organizations jointly hosted the "Commemorative Meeting for the 15th Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death." Those present included Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Mao Dun, Chen Boda, Li Lisan, Chen Yi, Ma Xulun, Hu Qiaomu, Zhou Yang, Xiao Hua, Feng Xuefeng, Ding Ling, Feng Wenbin, Xu Guangping, Zhou Jianren, Cai Chang, Li Siguang, Liang Xi, Hu Yuzhi, Liu Yazi, Lao She, Hu Feng, Ai Qing, Zhao Shuli, and other people from all walks of life in the capital, as well as international friends in Beijing, totaling 1,200 people.

Guo Moruo served as chairman of the commemorative meeting and delivered the opening speech. He said: Lu Xun is our national hero. Commemorating him involves both appreciating his contributions and learning from him. We must learn from Lu Xun's fighting spirit to oppose imperialism and eliminate the remnants of comprador and feudal ideology within us. We must also learn from his love for the people, the revolution, and the motherland, dedicating ourselves to the construction of our motherland and making it a world peace stronghold as powerful as the Soviet Union.

General Chen Yi pointed out in his speech: Lu Xun's fighting spirit can serve as a valuable lesson for any aspect of our work, including military work. General Chen Yi particularly emphasized the guiding significance of Lu Xun's process of studying Marxism-Leninism and his tireless ideological progress for the ideological transformation of intellectuals.

Chen Boda pointed out in his speech that Lu Xun became a great warrior and thinker because he combined the characteristics of fighting spirit and a serious work ethic. He then used Lu Xun's serious work as a comparison, criticizing the sloppy and shoddy style of today's cultural and publishing circles, pointing out that this is dangerous and hinders our progress. He called on the cultural circles to commemorate Lu Xun by improving the quality of their work.

Shen Junru said: Lu Xun best fulfilled Chairman Mao's instruction that literature and art should serve politics. Today's artists should learn from him in this regard.

Writer Mao Dun said: Lu Xun's attack on the enemy was relentless and repeated until the enemy surrendered or was eliminated. Commemorating him means learning from this spirit.

Combat hero Liu Zilin said in his speech: The People's Liberation Army must be a cultured army. We must continue to study culture and learn from Lu Xun to defend the motherland and its culture.

Labor model Han En said: Lu Xun used his pen to fight the enemy. We farmers must also use plows and hoes to improve production, ensure a bumper harvest, and defeat the enemy.

The literary and art circles in the capital held a commemorative literary and art evening on the 19th. Writers such as Lao She recited Lu Xun's works at the evening.

On the evening of the 18th, various agencies in North China held a meeting to commemorate the 15th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. Participants included 800 cadres from the North China Bureau, the preparatory committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Political Department of the North China Military Region, the North China Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the North China People's Revolutionary University, and various mass organizations in North China. After Comrade A Ying of the preparatory committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles introduced Mr. Lu Xun's life and deeds, Zhang Panshi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report. The report pointed out that, thanks to the correct implementation of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, the people's literature and art in North China have developed freely, and a large number of new literary and art workers have been trained and nurtured, as well as a group of worker-peasant-soldier literary and art workers. They have grown up in combination with the broad masses of working people and have been loved by them, becoming a huge force in the people's ideological education. However, our work achievements are still lagging behind compared with the development of the times, the war front, and industrial and agricultural labor, as well as the development of other construction undertakings and various aspects of work, and they are far from meeting the needs of the masses. Therefore, in commemorating Lu Xun, we should learn from his "tenacious" fighting spirit, his spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, and his serious work style. He called on everyone to correctly handle the relationship between politics and art, correctly treat national heritage and actively pursue new things, cultivate new writers, and get rid of the burden of "seniority." He also called for opposing the indiscriminate publication of books and periodicals, publishing more popular readings, improving the ideological level of works, and requiring everyone not to only learn from Lu Xun in form and in words, but to examine their work and solve concrete problems in their work with the spirit of Lu Xun. He said that under the light of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, we must do this and we will certainly do it well.

On the morning of the 19th, people from all walks of life in Shanghai went to the Hongqiao International Cemetery to pay their respects to Lu Xun's tomb and lay flowers. Shu Tong, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee, Feng Ding, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Xia Yan, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Ba Jin, Vice Chairman, Li Yu, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, and others also went to Lu Xun's tomb to lay flowers. At around 9:00 a.m., more than 1,500 representatives from all walks of life in East China and Shanghai solemnly held a commemorative meeting for the 70th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's birth and the 15th anniversary of his death at the Great Light Theater. Shu Tong delivered a report at the meeting. He said: In the fifteen years since Mr. Lu Xun's death, the Chinese cultural revolution has achieved great victory under the banner of Mao Zedong. In the two years since liberation, revolutionary literary and art work in East China and Shanghai has made great development and progress. However, the achievements of our literary and art work are still far from meeting the requirements of the objective situation. He pointed out that there is a serious tendency to detach from reality and the masses in the literary and art work of East China and Shanghai, which must be overcome. Literary and art workers must dedicate their souls to the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve them wholeheartedly. He called on literary and art workers in East China and Shanghai to learn from Mr. Lu Xun's serious spirit of criticism, to launch criticism and self-criticism in literary and art work, to overcome the vulgar habits of liberalism, and to make those seemingly correct but actually shoddy literary and art works lose any market.

Cultural circles in Chongqing, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shenyang, Nanjing, and other places held gatherings on the 19th to commemorate Mr. Lu Xun's 70th birthday and the 15th anniversary of his death. At the commemorative meeting held in Chongqing, Liao Jingdan, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report. He called on those present to learn from Lu Xun's uncompromising fighting spirit against the enemy and his serious and conscientious practical work spirit. He pointed out that there are certain vulgar and liberal tendencies in the literary and art circles in the Southwest that are divorced from politics. He called on the literary and art circles to be vigilant, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, master the weapons of political ideology, write excellent works that truly reflect the reality of the Southwest and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all reactionary and erroneous ideological tendencies.

At the commemorative meeting in Wuhan, Xiong Fu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Li Erzhong, Chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Pan Zinian, Minister of Education of the Central South Military and Political Committee, Xu Maoyong, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture, and worker-writer Zeng Xianbang unanimously called on those present to learn from Lu Xun's spirit of serving the people and fighting heroically against the enemy.

At the commemorative meeting held in Xi'an, Ke Zhongping, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and Chairman of the Northwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles, delivered a report entitled "Learning from Mr. Lu Xun's Fighting Spirit," calling on the literary and art circles to learn from Lu Xun's fighting spirit and overcome liberalist thinking.

At the commemorative meeting in Shenyang, Li Zhuoran, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, called on everyone to learn from Lu Xun's style of profoundly reflecting social reality and seriously dealing with ideological problems, to adhere to criticism and self-criticism in practical work and daily life, and to wholeheartedly go deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and into the fiery struggle.

At the commemorative meeting held in Nanjing, Lai Shaoqi, Chairman of the Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Fang Guangtao, Vice Chairman, gave a detailed introduction to Lu Xun's great contribution to the struggle of Chinese cultural thought.

    【本报讯】据新华社讯：首都及上海等地各界人士十九日隆重地纪念中国的伟大文学家和思想战士鲁迅的逝世十五周年。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会和其他有关机关、团体联合主持“鲁迅先生逝世十五周年纪念大会”，到会的有首都各界人士周恩来、郭沫若、沈钧儒、茅盾、陈伯达、李立三、陈毅、马叙伦、胡乔木、周扬、萧华、冯雪峰、丁玲、冯文彬、许广平、周建人、蔡畅、李四光、梁希、胡愈之、柳亚子、老舍、胡风、艾青、赵树理等及在北京的国际友人共一千二百人。
    纪念大会由郭沫若担任主席并致开会词。他说：鲁迅是我们的民族英雄，纪念他一方面要感谢他的贡献，一方面要学习他。我们要学习鲁迅的战斗精神去反对帝国主义，并肃清我们内部的买办思想、封建思想的残余；也要学习他对人民、对革命、对祖国的热爱，献身于祖国的建设，使我们的祖国成为象苏联一样强大的世界和平堡垒。
    陈毅将军讲话中指出：鲁迅的战斗精神，不论对我们任何一个角度的工作都可以作为宝贵的教训。军事工作方面也如此。陈毅将军特别强调了鲁迅的学习马克思列宁主义的自强不息的思想进步过程对知识分子思想改造的指导意义。
    陈伯达讲话指出，鲁迅所以成为伟大的战士和思想家，是因为在他的身上有战斗精神和认真工作的精神两者相结合的特点。他又以鲁迅的认真工作作对照，批评了今天文化出版界粗制滥造的潦草的作风，指出这是带有危险性和阻碍我们进步的。他号召文化界以提高工作质量来纪念鲁迅。
    沈钧儒讲话说：鲁迅是最好地完成了毛主席的文艺服从政治这一指示的。今天的文艺家要在这一点上学习他。
    作家茅盾讲话说：鲁迅的打击敌人，是毫不容情地和一次再一次地打，直到敌人投降或者消灭。纪念他要学习他的这种精神。
    战斗英雄刘子林在讲演中说：人民解放军必须是有文化的军队，我们必须继续学习文化，学习鲁迅，保卫祖国，保卫祖国的文化。
    劳动模范韩恩说：鲁迅用笔打敌人，我们农民也要用犁用锄头来搞好生产，保证丰收，战胜敌人。

    十九日清晨，上海市各界人民纷纷前往虹桥万国公墓祭扫鲁迅墓，并献花致敬。中共中央华东局宣传部部长、华东军政委员会文化教育委员会主任委员舒同、中共中央华东局宣传部副部长冯定、上海市人民政府副市长潘汉年、上海市文学艺术界联合会主席夏衍、副主席巴金、中共上海市委员会秘书长黎玉等都到鲁迅墓地献花致敬。上午九时许，华东和上海各界代表一千五百多人在大光明戏院隆重举行鲁迅先生诞生七十周年、逝世十五周年纪念大会。舒同在大会上作了报告。他说：鲁迅先生逝世十五年来，中国文化革命在毛泽东的旗帜下，已得到伟大的胜利。解放两年来，华东和上海的革命文艺工作有了很大的发展和进步。但是，我们文艺工作的成就与客观形势的要求还相差很远。他指出：在华东与上海文艺工作中存在脱离实际、脱离群众的严重倾向，必须加以克服，文艺工作者必须把自己的灵魂献给工农兵，全心全意为他们服务。他号召华东和上海的文艺工作者学习鲁迅先生的严肃的批评精神，展开文艺工作中的批评与自我批评，克服自由主义的庸俗习气，使那些似是而非、粗制滥造的文艺作品失去任何市场。
    重庆、武汉、西安、沈阳、南京等地文化界十九日都集会纪念鲁迅先生七十诞辰与逝世十五周年。在重庆举行的纪念会上，中共中央西南局宣传部副部长廖井丹作了报告。他号召到会者学习鲁迅对敌人毫不妥协的战斗精神和严肃认真的实际工作精神。他指出西南文艺界存在着某些脱离政治的庸俗化倾向和自由主义倾向。他号召文艺界警惕起来，认真学习马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想，掌握政治思想武器，写出真正反映西南现实的为工农兵服务的优秀作品，并和一切反动的和错误的思想倾向作不调和的斗争。
