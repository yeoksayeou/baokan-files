    When Recruiting Staff, Government Agencies Should
    Require Candidates to Have a "Clear History" and Should Not Stipulate the Condition of "Unblemished History"
To the Editor:
    Some government agencies often use "unblemished history" as one of the application requirements when recruiting staff. The original intention is to cautiously employ staff to maintain the purity of revolutionary organs. In the past, some government agencies did not conduct serious and prudent reviews when recruiting staff, allowing a small number of counter-revolutionaries to infiltrate the organs. This must arouse our high vigilance. However, we should strictly distinguish these counter-revolutionaries from those who have participated in reactionary party, league, or secret society organizations but have indeed severed relations with these reactionary party, league, or secret societies before and after liberation. The former must be dealt with according to law, while the latter must be reformed and educated. If "unblemished history" is used as an application condition and restrictions are imposed, the result will be that many talents needed for national construction and capable of being reformed and educated will not easily obtain the opportunity to serve national construction. This restriction on recruiting staff should be changed.
    Currently, there is a large demand for various construction talents throughout the country. When recruiting staff, we must conduct serious and prudent reviews. We must require applicants to truthfully explain their history to the People's Government without concealment. Honesty and integrity are essential political qualities for staff of the People's Government. Falsifying history and concealing deception are bad habits of the old society. Anyone who wishes to serve the people must eliminate these bad habits. State organs must adopt a policy of unity and education towards all those who truthfully explain their history to the People's Government and request reform, and use them according to their talents. Therefore, I believe that it is wrong for some government agencies to refuse to employ those who have already truthfully explained their history to the People's Government and requested reform; and it is also inappropriate to require those who have participated in reactionary party, league, or secret society organizations and have indeed severed relations with the reactionary organizations before and after liberation to all have an "unblemished history." I suggest that all government agencies change the requirement of "unblemished history" to "clear history" when recruiting staff.

### 机关招考工作人员时应该要求投考者“历史清楚”不应规定“历史清白”的条件

    机关招考工作人员时
    应该要求投考者“历史清楚”  不应规定“历史清白”的条件编辑同志：
    某些机关在招收工作人员时，常常把“历史清白”作为报考条件之一；其原意是为了谨慎地任用工作人员，以保持革命机关的纯洁性。过去某些机关对于招收工作人员没有严肃谨慎地审查，而使少数反革命分子混入机关，这必须引起我们的高度警惕。但是，我们应该把这种反革命分子，和那些曾参加反动党团会门组织、但在解放前后确已与这些反动党团会门断绝关系的人，严格加以区别。对于前者须依法处理，对于后者则须改造教育。如果以“历史清白”作为投考条件而加以限制，其结果将使许多为国家建设所需的而又可以改造教育的各种人才，不易获得为国家建设服务的机会。这种招考工作人员的限制，是应该改变的。
    现在，全国各地大量需要各种建设人才。在吸收工作人员时，我们必须严肃谨慎地进行审查工作，必须要求报考者把自己的历史毫不隐瞒地向人民政府交代清楚。忠诚老实是人民政府的工作人员所必备的政治品质。伪造历史、隐瞒欺骗则是旧社会的恶劣习气。凡愿为人民服务的人，必须肃清这种恶习。国家机关对于所有忠诚老实地向人民政府交代清楚历史要求改造的人必须采取团结教育的方针，量才使用。因此，我认为某些机关对于既已向人民政府交代清楚历史要求改造的人，反而拒绝录用是错误的；而要求曾参加反动党团会门、在解放前后确已与反动组织断绝关系的人，尽皆“历史清白”，也是不妥的。我建议各机关招考工作人员时把“历史清白”的规定改为“历史清楚”。
