Resist America, Aid Korea Work Brief Review

    Lama Temples Become Centers for Propagating the Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign in Ethnic Minority Areas

    In the Northwest and Southwest regions where ethnic minorities reside, many Lama temples have now become centers for the local Resist America, Aid Korea movement. For example, Gungtangcang Jiayang (Living Buddha), the steward of Labrang Monastery in Xiahe County, Gansu Province, led a group of people in July and August this year to conduct Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in the Tibetan nomadic areas in southern Xiahe and Songpan, Sichuan. At that time, sixty-six chieftains from fifteen tribes, representing all the monks of the monasteries, wrote to Chairman Mao expressing their determination to support the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. Rikuzong Monastery in Kangding County, Xikang Province, has organized all its more than 300 lamas to study current affairs, and 60 lamas have participated in production, having already collected more than 6,000 jin of rhubarb, 5 jin of anemarrhena, and 6 jin of cordyceps (a precious medicinal material), and reclaimed more than 40 mu of wasteland. They also donated 3 million yuan from their production income to purchase airplanes and cannons.

    Facts have proven that in areas where ethnic minorities reside, using temples to carry out patriotic propaganda and education is very effective. Making temples activity centers for promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is an experience that can be promoted in all ethnic minority areas.

    喇嘛寺院成为少数民族地区宣传抗美援朝的中心
    在西北、西南的少数民族集居地区，有许多喇嘛寺院现已成为当地宣传抗美援朝运动的中心。如甘肃夏河县拉卜楞寺院管家贡唐仓嘉白样（活佛），今年七、八月间曾率领一批人员深入夏河南部和四川松潘一带藏族游牧地区进行抗美援朝宣传。当时就有十五个部落的土官六十六人，代表各寺院全体僧众，上书毛主席表示拥护抗美援朝的决心。西康省康定县的日库寺，全寺三百多名喇嘛都已组织起来学习时事，并有六十名喇嘛参加了生产，现已采掘大黄六千多斤、知母五斤和虫草（一种名贵药材）六斤，并开荒四十多亩。他们并从生产收入中捐献了三百万元购买飞机大炮。
    事实证明，在少数民族集居的地区，利用寺院进行爱国主义的宣传教育，收效很大。使寺院成为推行抗美援朝运动的活动中心，这一经验，各少数民族集居的地区，都可以推广。
