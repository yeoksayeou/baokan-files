    No Stealing of State Property Allowed!
    The vast majority of our cadres are good cadres who are honest, dedicated, diligent, and serve the people. This is beyond doubt. However, dereliction of duty and corruption that violate national policies and laws still exist in some agencies, and this is something we must be very vigilant about. The cases of Zhang Qingzhong, Director of the Industry and Commerce Department of Suiyuan Province, supporting the private sale of state gold by subordinates, and Liu Shaojie, Deputy County Head of Sa County, embezzling funds, are two clear examples.
    Dereliction of duty and corruption are ugly behaviors unique to the exploiting classes. The ruling institutions of the exploiting classes are vast machines for corruption and blood-sucking. The phenomena of dereliction of duty and corruption that still exist today are "cursed relics" of the old society. These ugly phenomena must and can be completely eliminated from the organs of the revolutionary regime. In the past, the People's Government has severely dealt with many discovered dereliction of duty and corruption cases. This time, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government has also severely dealt with the aforementioned two cases, sentencing those guilty of dereliction of duty and corruption to death or imprisonment. In order to uphold the dignity of national laws and the interests of the people, and in order to educate cadres, doing so is very necessary and very correct.
    At the same time, the People's Government's procuratorial organs must also more closely connect with the masses and rely on the power of the broad masses to expose lawbreakers and corrupt elements hiding in various dark corners to the light of day. In 1926, Stalin said in "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy": "We must systematically combat theft, the so-called 'happy' theft in our state organs, cooperatives, and trade unions. … Relying on the State Security Department alone will not be able to eliminate them all. Other, more effective and serious methods are needed here. This method is to create an atmosphere of general moral resistance and hatred among the surrounding masses around these thieves. This method is to launch a movement among workers and peasants to create a spiritual atmosphere that excludes the possibility of theft, so that thieves who steal the property of the people, whether 'happy' or 'unhappy,' cannot live and exist. Eliminating theft is one of the means of protecting our accumulation and avoiding waste—that is the task."
    We are carrying out the great struggle to win the final victory in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and we are undertaking the great task of achieving national industrialization as soon as possible. Every bit of state property that is encroached upon by thieves weakens the strength of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and national construction by one bit. All revolutionary workers must maintain and carry forward the tradition of hard struggle, participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy, and at the same time actively participate in the serious struggle against corruption, protect every bit of state and people's property, and not allow anyone to steal it!

    不许盗窃国家财产！
    我们的干部绝大多数是廉洁奉公勤劳为民的好干部，这是丝毫勿庸置疑的。可是，违犯国家政策法令的渎职分子和贪污分子在某些机关中仍然存在，也是我们不能不十分警惕的。绥远省工商厅厅长张庆中等支持所属私售国家黄金案和萨县副县长刘绍杰贪污案，就是两个显明的例子。
    渎职贪污，都是剥削阶级特有的丑恶行为；剥削阶级的统治机构就是庞大的贪污吸血机器。目前依然存在的贪污渎职现象，乃是旧社会的“该诅咒的遗物”。在革命政权机关里，必须而且必能彻底地消灭这些丑恶的现象。过去，人民政府对于不少已发现的渎职贪污分子已作了严肃的处理；这次绥远省人民政府对前述两个案件也已严肃地作了处理，对贪污渎职者分别处以死刑或徒刑。为了维护国家法纪的尊严和人民的利益，为了教育干部，这样做是十分必要、十分正确的。
    同时，人民政府的检察机关还必要更紧密地联系群众，依靠广大群众的力量，才能把藏在各个阴暗角落里的违法贪污分子暴露在光天化日之下。斯大林一九二六年在“论苏联经济形势与党底政策”中说：“我们必须与盗窃行为，与我们国家机关、合作社、职工会中的所谓‘快乐的’盗窃行为进行有系统的斗争。……依靠国家保安部是不能把他们全部除尽的。这里需要另外的、更有效更严肃的办法。这种办法，就是在这些盗贼周围造成一般道德抵制及周围群众憎恨的气氛。这种办法，就是在工人和农民中间掀起一个运动，造成一种精神的气氛，这种气氛排斥偷盗的可能性，使偷窃人民财物的盗贼，不论‘快乐的’或‘不快乐的’，都不能生活与存在。消灭盗窃，乃是防护我们的积累，避免耗费的手段之一，——任务就是如此。”
    我们正进行着争取抗美援朝最后胜利的伟大斗争，正担负着争取国家早日实现工业化的巨大任务。国家财产多被盗窃者侵蚀一分，就削弱了抗美援朝和国家建设的一分力量。一切革命工作人员，必须保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的传统，参加增产节约运动，同时还应积极参加反贪污的严肃斗争，保卫国家人民的每一分财产，不许任何人进行盗窃！
