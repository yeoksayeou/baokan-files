    I Eliminated My Fear of Atomic Weapons After Reading Stalin's Talk
    To the Editor:
    The talk on atomic weapons by Stalin, the great leader of the world's people, has inspired our confidence in the struggle to defend peace.
    Previously, I had many incorrect views about atomic weapons. Although I had signed the declaration demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, I was still somewhat afraid in my heart. When studying the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, I was initially unclear about the role of the American atomic bombs dropped on Japan, mistakenly believing that atomic bombs played a major role in促使Japan's surrender.
    Now, Stalin's talk has further eliminated my fear of atomic weapons and made me understand more clearly the essence of imperialism's attempts to monopolize atomic bombs and its so-called "control" proposals. In the future, we must follow Stalin's instructions, strengthen national defense construction, and defeat imperialist aggression. I will certainly respond to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and the resolutions of the Fifteenth Student Congress, study hard, do a good job, and be ready at any time to fight to defend and build our motherland.

### 我读了斯大林的谈话以后消除了害怕原子武器的心理

    我读了斯大林的谈话以后消除了害怕原子武器的心理编辑同志：
    世界人民的伟大领袖斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话，鼓舞了我们为保卫和平而斗争的信心。
    在以前，我对于原子武器有着很多不正确的看法。虽然我已在要求禁止原子武器的宣言上签了名，但心里还是有些害怕的。在学习对日和约问题时，对于美国在日本投原子弹的作用起初也很不清楚，误认为原子弹对促使日本投降的作用很大。
    现在，斯大林的谈话使我更进一步地消除了对原子武器的害怕心理，也更了解了帝国主义对原子弹的垄断企图与它的所谓“管制”主张的本质。今后我们一定要遵循斯大林的指示，加强国防建设，打败帝国主义的侵略。我一定响应抗美援朝总会的号召及十五届学生代表大会的决议，学好功课，搞好工作，并随时准备为保卫祖国建设祖国而奋斗。
