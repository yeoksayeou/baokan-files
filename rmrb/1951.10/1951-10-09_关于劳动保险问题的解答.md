Central People's Government Ministry of Labor, Labor Insurance Bureau

Since the promulgation of the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China," the labor insurance system has begun to be established nationwide, thanks to the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers and staff, and the active support and promotion of Party, government, and trade union organizations in various regions. However, labor insurance is a new undertaking, and various regions have encountered some difficult problems in carrying out this work. We have now collected the more universal and difficult-to-solve problems among these and provide unified answers for publication, so that various regions have a basis for carrying out the work.

(1) In enterprises implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations, the original
	medical treatment is higher than the standard
	stipulated in the Labor Insurance Regulations - workers and staff
	and their families all receive free medical
	treatment. How should this be handled after the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations?

Article 13 of the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" regarding the medical treatment of workers and staff and their dependent direct relatives is based on current economic conditions. If the original medical treatment of each enterprise is higher than the standard stipulated in the Labor Insurance Regulations, and the enterprise administration or the employer is still willing to maintain the original regulations, the portion exceeding the Labor Insurance Regulations can be regarded as welfare benefits, and workers and their families can continue to enjoy them.

(2) What should be done if a worker or staff member's continuous
	medical treatment period after stopping work due to illness
	exceeds six months and they still need to continue medical treatment?

If a worker or staff member in an enterprise implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations stops working due to illness and the continuous medical treatment period exceeds six months, they should be treated as disabled and retiring, and a sickness relief fund of 20% to 30% of their wages will be paid from the labor insurance fund, based on the length of their working years in the enterprise. However, if the worker's illness has not yet recovered and they still need to continue medical treatment, it can be handled in the following three ways:

(1) If the worker's condition has gradually improved, and the doctor certifies that the medical stage can be concluded soon if medical treatment is continued, the enterprise administration or the employer should try to continue to provide medical treatment.

(2) If the worker's condition requires long-term recuperation and they have a home to return to, the enterprise administration or the employer can consult with the trade union organization to persuade them to return home for recuperation. The enterprise administration or the employer should pay for the return trip home; in addition, the labor insurance fund will pay one year's sickness relief fund in advance (calculated and paid at 20% to 30% of the worker's wages) according to item B of Article 13 of the Labor Insurance Regulations. When the one-year period expires and continued recuperation is required, the sickness relief fund they should receive thereafter will be paid monthly or every three months.

(3) If the worker's condition still requires long-term recuperation and they have no home to return to, the enterprise administration or the employer can try to arrange for them to be settled.

(3) Why is it stipulated that sick leave wages are paid according
	to the length of service in the enterprise, at 50% to
	100% of the employee's wages?

The issue of sick leave wages should be viewed from two aspects: On the one hand, wages are remuneration for labor. During the period when workers and staff members stop working due to illness, since they have not engaged in labor, there is no labor remuneration. Sick leave wages are actually labor insurance benefits paid in the name of wages, and the standard of payment is to ensure the minimum living needs of workers and staff members; on the other hand, it is to take care of the development of enterprise production. Taking the length of service in the enterprise as the standard for calculating benefits, its role is to reduce the mobility of workers and staff, so that workers and staff can be fixed in the enterprise for a long time to accumulate experience and improve production technology and proficiency. Therefore, it is stipulated that sick leave wages are paid according to the length of service in the enterprise, at 50% to 100% of the employee's wages.

More than 30 years of experience in the implementation of social insurance in the Soviet Union has proved that this provision has played a certain role in the development of production. Therefore, the standards of various benefits in Soviet social insurance are constantly improving, and the conditions are constantly relaxed. However, the payment standard for sickness benefits is always maintained according to the length of service in the enterprise. The sick leave allowance in social insurance in other new democratic countries is not paid according to the full wage. For example, in Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and other countries, the sick leave allowance during the sick leave period is paid according to the length of service in the enterprise, at 50% to 100% of the employee's wages, which is the same as the sick leave wage stipulated in China's labor regulations. Judging from the actual situation in China, it also proves that this provision is necessary. For example, some factories stipulate that wages are paid as usual for sick leave within three days, resulting in a surge in absenteeism; some factories stipulate that wages are not paid for sick leave within three days, resulting in most workers and staff taking sick leave for more than three days. Judging from the examples listed above, the stipulation that sick leave wages are paid according to the length of service in the enterprise, at 50% to 100% of the employee's wages, not only ensures the minimum living needs of workers and staff, but also takes care of the development of enterprise production, which is reasonable and necessary.

(4) Why should labor insurance collective contracts be signed
	according to the three principles stipulated in Article 5 of the
	Draft Implementing Regulations for the Labor Insurance Regulations?

Article 5 of the Draft Implementing Regulations for the Labor Insurance Regulations regarding the conclusion of labor insurance collective contracts is to take care of the special difficulties encountered by workers and staff in enterprises that do not implement the Labor Insurance Regulations when they encounter birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability. The content of the contract must be based on the three principles listed in that article. The reasons are as follows:

First, the items of labor insurance benefits should be determined according to the economic conditions of the enterprise and the needs of workers and staff. Because too few benefit items cannot meet the needs of workers and staff, and too many benefit items may put too much burden on the enterprise and affect production. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account both the needs of workers and staff and the economic conditions of the enterprise, so that workers and staff can receive appropriate benefits, and the enterprise will not exceed its ability to bear the burden.

Second, the various labor insurance benefits must not exceed the standards stipulated in the Labor Insurance Regulations. Because before the Labor Insurance Regulations were promulgated and implemented, the draft was published to solicit the opinions of the people of the whole country. The provisions of the various benefit standards in the regulations are basically in line with the current economic conditions and the requirements of all workers and staff. Some of the enterprises that conclude labor insurance collective contracts are factories and mines with less than 100 people, and the scale is relatively small. Generally speaking, the economic conditions are worse than those of larger factories and mines, and the benefit standards stipulated in the labor insurance collective contract cannot exceed the various benefit standards stipulated in the Labor Insurance Regulations.

If the economic conditions of individual enterprises are particularly good, and the enterprise administration or the employer voluntarily gives workers and staff better benefits, the part exceeding the Labor Insurance Regulations can be regarded as welfare benefits and stipulated in the collective contract.

Third, the various labor insurance expenses are directly paid by the enterprise administration or the employer. Because the conclusion of a collective contract is different from the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, if the labor insurance fund is drawn and handled by the trade union organization, once the labor insurance fund is not enough to cover the expenses, there is no way to adjust it, so it must be directly paid by the enterprise administration or the employer. However, if a collective contract is concluded by an industry, and the units under the industry are willing to draw labor insurance funds according to the total wages on a monthly basis, and the industry unifies the adjustment, the amount of labor insurance funds to be collected and the adjustment method can be specified in the collective contract according to the specific circumstances of each industry.

In addition, if the original labor insurance collective contract or the original method of each enterprise is higher than the benefits stipulated in the Labor Insurance Regulations, the original collective contract or the original method can be maintained with the consent of both the trade union organization and the enterprise administration or the employer, and there is no need to re-sign it. If the original collective contract expires, the original standard can still be maintained, and the validity period can be extended or re-signed. When re-signing, the benefits stipulated in the original contract must all maintain the original standard. It is not allowed to retain a certain standard that is higher than the Labor Insurance Regulations on the one hand, and to raise a certain standard that is lower than the Labor Insurance Regulations on the other hand.

(5) What principles is the "Draft Classification List
	of Medical Drugs Applicable to Enterprises Implementing Labor Insurance Regulations" based on?

Article 13 of the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" stipulates that the medical treatment for workers and staff who are sick or injured for non-work-related reasons is that the cost of ordinary medicines is borne by the enterprise administration or the employer, and the cost of expensive medicines is borne by the workers and staff themselves. The main reason for this stipulation is that the country's financial and economic situation has not yet fundamentally improved, and the enterprises' ability to bear the burden is limited. If it is stipulated that all medicine costs must be borne by the enterprise, it will inevitably put too much burden on the enterprise, which will affect the development of production and be detrimental to the construction of the entire country. However, the wages of general workers and staff members are still very low, and they may not be able to afford the expensive medicine costs. Therefore, on the other hand, we try our best to take care of the actual difficulties of workers and staff. Therefore, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government announced the "Draft Classification List of Medical Drugs Applicable to Enterprises Implementing Labor Insurance Regulations" on June 15 this year, and notified the enterprises implementing Labor Insurance Regulations to refer to it for trial implementation. The formulation of the draft classification list of medicines is first based on the actual needs of workers and staff for illness and injury, and takes into account the current economic conditions and the supply of medicines. Therefore, the medicines are appropriately divided into three categories: ordinary medicines, controlled medicines, and expensive medicines. Most of the commonly used medicines have been included in the list of ordinary medicines and controlled medicines. If controlled medicines are decided to be used by the attending physician, the expenses are also borne by the enterprise administration and the employer. Only a few medicines that are very expensive and can be replaced by other cheaper medicines, or are not specifically effective in treatment, and need to be taken in large quantities for a long time are included in the list of expensive medicines. Moreover, some medicines in the list of expensive medicines that are necessary for the treatment of certain illnesses and injuries are also included in the list of controlled medicines at the same time. In this way, the medicines included in the list of ordinary medicines and controlled medicines can basically solve the medical needs of workers and staff for illness and injury. For example, although "penicillin" has a wide range of uses and is very expensive, it can be replaced by "anti-inflammatory tablets" in the treatment of many kinds of diseases, so it is listed as an expensive medicine. However, it is listed as a controlled medicine when used for certain diseases that must be treated with "penicillin", such as acute pneumonia, scarlet fever, erysipelas, septicemia, and acute peritonitis. "Streptomycin" is not a specific drug for treating lung diseases, requires a large amount, and is expensive, so it is listed as an expensive drug. "Zaofa Da'an," "Hu Po Huang An Li," and "Sulfanilamide Caine" are all imported from abroad, are expensive, and can be replaced by "Sulfanilamide Thiazole Tablets," which are cheaper and have similar effects, so they are listed as expensive medicines.

In addition, the announcement of the "Draft Classification List of Medical Drugs Applicable to Enterprises Implementing Labor Insurance Regulations" is for the enterprises implementing Labor Insurance Regulations to refer to it for trial implementation. If the enterprise administration or the employer voluntarily changes expensive medicines to controlled medicines based on the specific conditions of the local area and the enterprise, or includes other medicines that are not included in the draft classification list of medical drugs, they can also consult with the trade union grassroots organization and decide after reporting to the local labor administrative organ for record.

    关于劳动保险问题的解答
    中央人民政府劳动部劳动保险局
    中华人民共和国劳动保险条例公布以来，由于广大工人职员群众、工商业家热烈拥护，各地党、政府和工会组织积极支持与推动，目前在全国范围内劳动保险制度已开始建立。但劳动保险是一件新的工作，各地在进行这一工作中，或多或少都曾遇到一些疑难问题。现在我们把这些问题中带有普遍性的、比较难以解决的搜集起来，作出统一的解答加以公布，以便各地在进行工作时有所依据。
    （一）实行劳动保险条例的企业，其原有
        医疗待遇比劳动保险条例规定的标
        准高——职工及其家属均免费医
        疗，实行劳动保险条例以后，应如
        何处理？
    中华人民共和国劳动保险条例第十三条中关于工人职员及其供养直系亲属疾病的医疗待遇系根据目前经济条件而定。如各企业原有医疗待遇较劳动保险条例规定的标准高，企业行政方面或资方仍愿继续维持原有规定时，其超出劳动保险条例所规定的部分，可作为福利待遇，职工及其家属仍可继续享受。
    （二）职工患病停止工作连续医疗期间超
        过六个月以后仍需继续医疗，应如
        何处理？
    实行劳动保险条例企业内的职工，患病停止工作连续医疗期间超过六个月以后，应按残废退职待遇处理，由劳动保险基金项下，根据其本企业工龄的长短，发给本人工资百分之二十至三十的疾病救济费。但职工疾病尚未痊愈，仍需继续医疗时，可按下列三种情况处理：
    （1）职工病况已逐渐好转，经医生证明，如继续医疗，其医疗阶段不久即可终结者，企业行政方面或资方，应设法继续给与医疗。
    （2）职工病况须长期休养，有家可归者，可由企业行政方面或资方与工会组织协商，劝其返家休养，回家时得由企业行政方面或资方发给返家路费；另由劳动保险基金项下，按劳动保险条例第十三条乙项规定，一次先发给一年的疾病救济费（按本人工资百分之二十至三十计算支付）。一年期满，尚须休养时，其以后应领的疾病救济费，每月或每三月发给一次。
    （3）职工病况仍须长期休养无家可归者，可由企业行政方面或资方与工会组织设法予以安置。
    （三）为什么病假工资规定照本企业工龄
        长短发给本人工资百分之五十至一
            百？
    关于病假工资的问题，应从两方面来看：一方面工资是劳动的报酬，职工患病停止工作期间，既未从事劳动，自无劳动报酬。病假工资，实际上是以工资名义支付的劳动保险待遇，其支付的标准，是保障职工最低的生活需要；另一方面，是照顾企业生产的发展。以本企业工龄作为计算待遇的标准，其作用是减少职工的流动性，使职工长期固定在企业内工作累积经验，提高生产技术与熟练程度。所以规定病假工资照本企业工龄长短发给本人工资百分之五十至一百。
    苏联实行社会保险三十余年的经验，证明此项规定对发展生产起了一定作用。所以苏联社会保险中各项待遇标准，不断提高，条件不断放宽，唯对疾病补助费，始终维持以本企业工龄长短，作为支付标准。其他新民主主义国家社会保险中的病假期间补助费，都不是按全部工资发给，如罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚等国，均按本企业工龄长短，发给本人工资百分之五十至一百的病假期间补助费，与我国劳动条例规定的病假工资相同。照中国实际情况看来，也证明此项规定是必要的。例如：有些工厂规定请病假三天以内，工资照发，结果缺勤率激增；有些工厂规定病假三天以内不发工资，结果职工请病假大多数都超过三天。从上面所列举各例证看来，病假工资规定照本企业工龄长短发给本人工资百分之五十至一百，既保障职工最低生活需要，又照顾了企业生产的发展，是合理的也是必要的。
    （四）为什么劳动保险集体合同要按劳动
        保险条例实施细则草案第五条规定
        的三个原则订立？
    劳动保险条例实施细则草案第五条关于订立劳动保险集体合同的规定，是为了照顾不实行劳动保险条例企业的职工发生生、老、病、死、伤、残时的特殊困难。合同的内容，必须根据该条所列三个原则。其理由如下：
    第一，劳动保险待遇的项目应根据该企业经济情况与工人职员的需要决定之。因为，待遇项目过少，不能适应职工的需要，待遇项目过多，又可能使企业负担过重，影响生产。所以必须根据职工的需要与企业的经济条件，双方兼顾，使职工能够得到适当的待遇，而企业不至超过其可以负担的能力。
    第二，各项劳动保险待遇均不得超过劳动保险条例所规定的标准。因为劳动保险条例公布实行前，曾将草案公布，征求全国人民的意见。该条例各项待遇标准的规定，基本上是合于目前经济条件及全体职工要求的。订立劳动保险集体合同的企业，有些是百人以下的厂、矿，规模较小。一般说来，经济条件较大厂、矿差，劳动保险集体合同内规定的待遇标准，自不能超过劳动保险条例规定的各项待遇标准。
    如个别企业经济情况特殊良好，企业行政方面或资方自愿给予职工较优待遇，其超过劳动保险条例规定部分，可以作为福利待遇，规定于集体合同中。
    第三，各项劳动保险费用均由企业行政方面或资方直接支付。因为订立集体合同与实行劳动保险条例有所不同，如果抽劳动保险金交由工会组织办理，一旦劳动保险金不敷支出，是无从调剂的，所以必须由企业行政方面或资方直接支付。但以一个行业订立集体合同，行业中所属各单位愿意按月照工资总额抽出劳动保险金，由行业统一调剂时，可根据各该行业的具体情况，将劳动保险金的征集数额与调剂方法在集体合同中予以规定。
    此外，各企业原订劳动保险集体合同或原有办法较劳动保险条例所规定待遇高时，经工会组织及企业行政方面或资方双方同意，仍可维持原订集体合同或原有办法，不必重订。如原订集体合同期满，仍可维持原订标准，延长有效期间或重新订立。在重行订立时，其原订合同所规定待遇必须全部维持原订的标准。不得一方面保留高于劳动保险条例的某项标准，而另一方面又提高低于劳动保险条例的某项标准。
    （五）“适用于实行劳动保险条例企业的
        医疗药品分类名单草案”是根据什
        么原则制定的？
    中华人民共和国劳动保险条例第十三条中规定工人职员疾病或非因工负伤的医疗待遇是普通药费由企业行政方面或资方负担，贵重药费由职工本人自理，其所以如此规定，主要是因为目前国家财政经济状况还未基本好转，企业的负担能力有限，如规定全部药费均须由企业负担，势必使企业负担过重，而影响到生产的发展，对于整个国家的建设是不利的。但目前一般工人职员的工资还很低，可能无力负担贵重药费，因此在另一方面是尽可能的照顾职工的实际困难。所以中央人民政府劳动部在今年六月十五日公布了“适用于实行劳动保险条例企业的医疗药品分类名单草案”，通知实行劳动保险条例各企业参照试行。该项药品分类名单草案的拟订，首先是根据职工病伤的实际需要，并照顾到目前的经济条件与药品供应状况，因此将药品适当的分为普通药品、管制药品及贵重药品三类，极大多数的常用药品都已列入普通药品及管制药品的名单中，管制药品如经主治医师决定使用时，其费用亦由企业行政方面与资方负担。只有少数价格很高而可用其他比较便宜的药品代替的或在治疗上并非特效的及需要长期大量服用的药品列入贵重药品名单中。并且在贵重药品名单中的某些药品为治疗某些病伤所必需使用的，亦同时列入管制药品中。这样，列入普通药品及管制药品名单中的药品，已可以基本上解决职工病伤医疗上的需要。如“盘尼西林”用途虽广，价格很高，而在医疗不少种类的疾病时，可以用“消炎片”代替，所以列为贵重药品，但用于某些必须使用“盘尼西林”治疗的病症，如急性肺炎、猩红热、丹毒、败血症、急性腹膜炎等，即列为管制药品。“链霉素”治疗肺病并非特效药，需用量很多而价格高，因此列为贵重药品。“早发大安”“琥珀磺?力”“磺胺?嗪”三种消炎片均由国外输入，价格高而又有价格较便宜而功效相仿的“磺胺噻唑片”可以代替，所以将其列为贵重药品。
    此外“适用于实行劳动保险条例企业的医疗药品分类名单草案”的公布，是给实行劳动保险条例企业单位参照试行，如企业行政方面或资方根据当地及本企业具体情况自愿将贵重药品改列为管制药品，或将其他未列入该医疗药品分类名单草案的药品列入时，亦可与工会基层组织协商决定后，报请当地劳动行政机关备案。
