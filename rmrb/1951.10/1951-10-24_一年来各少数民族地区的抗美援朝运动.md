    Over the past year, the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement has spread extensively throughout the remote ethnic minority regions in the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, and Inner Mongolia. This not only demonstrates the widespread and in-depth nature of the Chinese people's Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement but also highlights the further consolidation of the unity among all ethnic groups in China.

    Among the various ethnic groups, many young men and women have joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, bravely fighting against the American aggressors on the Korean front. Liu Xingwen, a nineteen-year-old Miao volunteer soldier, continuously repelled eleven enemy assaults and killed or wounded over a hundred enemies in the blocking battle of Paktal Peak in May of this year. He became a renowned combat hero.

    People of all ethnic groups care for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army as if they were their own children. By June of this year, ethnic minorities in Longli County, Guizhou Province, had written over 24,600 letters of慰问(comfort) to the soldiers of the Chinese and Korean people. Representatives of 1.5 million people from the Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, and Kazakh ethnic groups in Gansu Province jointly wrote a letter to pay their respects to the people's soldiers on the Korean front, saying in the letter, "We are determined to strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries with practical actions to support your heroic struggle and give the American aggressors a relentless blow." People of all ethnic groups have offered their own specialties—cattle, sheep, horses, deer antlers, musk, felt, etc.—to慰劳(express sympathy and solicitude) the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.

    People of all ethnic groups enthusiastically launched patriotic donation campaigns. The Tibetans in Gansu and Xikang regions, and the Miao and Yao people in the mountains of Yunnan and Guizhou, are all working hard to increase production and make donations. The people of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region in Gansu Province completed their plan to donate an airplane ahead of schedule on August 1st; the people of the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang Province have already overfulfilled their plan to donate an anti-aircraft gun. Many vivid examples have emerged in the donation campaign: In 迪化(Dihua)City, an elderly man named Han Baowang, 75 years old, from an ethnic minority, started picking up waste paper in the streets every day from July 1st to donate weapons. By mid-September, he had collected 650 kilograms of waste paper and donated all the money he earned. He is still continuing this work. Hui women from the Qingzhen West Daotang in Lintan County, Gansu Province, donated many silver dollars, gold rings, silver ingots, and silver bracelets that they had treasured for many years, saying: These are our beloved items that we have kept for many years, and we want to use these beloved things to express a bit of our patriotism.

    People of all ethnic groups have generally established patriotic covenants. The Miao people of Sapushan in Wuding County, Yunnan Province, conducted a full democratic discussion when establishing their patriotic covenant. They said: In the past, imperialists provoked our relationship with the Han people, but now we must strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups and defeat American imperialism. They wrote in the patriotic covenant: "Do a good job in ethnic unity and crush the enemy's divisive conspiracies." In addition, they also stipulated doing a good job in agricultural production and stepping up current affairs study in the patriotic covenant.

    This year, the Kazakh herdsmen of Sulei County in Xinjiang specially traveled from the deep mountains a hundred miles away to the county seat to pay taxes because they had established a patriotic covenant, which resulted in the early completion of the state's tax revenue task.

    People of all ethnic groups have also made good achievements in the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. For example, the people of all ethnic groups in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, helped the families of soldiers with more than 4,490 workdays of plowing and collected more than 13,500 kilograms of grain and more than 30 cattle and horses to help those families of martyrs and soldiers who were experiencing difficulties.

    The active participation of people of all ethnic groups in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement demonstrates their love for the motherland and their love for their happy lives today. A Hui-Han mutual aid team in Baozi Township, Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Province, wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "None of the seventeen households in our team had ever eaten a full meal in the past. This year, not only can every household eat their fill and dress warmly, but the whole team has also bought six livestock and built five new two-story houses and sixteen one-story houses. None of our children had ever gone to school before, but this year ten boys and four girls have enrolled in school. We cannot allow the American aggressors to destroy such a good life, so we must step up production and work hard to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." This is the common voice of the people of all ethnic groups in China and the source of the strength of the Chinese people's Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 一年来各少数民族地区的抗美援朝运动

    一年来各少数民族地区的抗美援朝运动
    在西北、西南、中南和内蒙各少数民族聚居的边远地区，一年来已普遍地展开了抗美援朝运动。这不但表明了中国人民抗美援朝运动的普遍深入，而且显示了中国各兄弟民族的团结已更加巩固。
    在各个兄弟民族中，都有许多青年男女参加了中国人民志愿军，他们在朝鲜前线英勇地打击着美国侵略者。十九岁的苗族志愿军战士刘兴文，在今年五月坚守朴达峰的阻击战中，和另一个志愿军战士一连打退了敌人十一次冲锋，杀伤敌人一百多名。他成为著名的战斗英雄。
    各兄弟民族人民像关心自己的子弟一样关心着中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。贵州省龙里县的少数民族人民，到今年六月为止，已给中朝人民战士写了二万四千六百多封慰问信。甘肃省的回、藏、蒙、维吾尔、哈萨克等各民族一百五十万人民的代表，曾联合写信向朝鲜前线的人民战士致敬，他们在信上说：“我们坚决以加强各民族团结，坚决镇压反革命的实际行动，来支援你们的英勇斗争，给美国侵略者以无情的打击。”各民族人民都拿出了他们自己的特产——牛、羊、马、鹿茸、麝香、毛毡等等慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。
    各少数民族人民热烈地展开了爱国捐献运动。在甘肃、西康地区的藏民，在云南、贵州崇山峻岭间的苗民和瑶民，他们都努力地增加生产，进行捐献。甘肃省天祝藏族自治区人民在八月一日提前完成了捐献飞机一架的计划；西康省藏族自治区人民，已经超额完成了捐献高射炮一门的计划。在捐献运动中涌现了不少生动的事例：迪化市的少数民族人民中，有一个名叫韩宝旺的七十五岁的老人，为了捐献武器，从七月一日开始每天上街捡拾字纸，到九月中旬止，他已拾了六百五十斤字纸，将卖得的钱全部捐献，现在他仍在继续这个工作。甘肃临潭县清真西道堂的回族妇女，捐献出许多珍藏多年的银洋、金戒指、银锞、银手镯等，她们说：这些是我们保存了许多年的心爱物品，我们要拿这些心爱的东西来表示自己的一点爱国心。
    各少数民族人民已普遍地订立了爱国公约。云南武定县洒普山苗民在订立爱国公约时进行了充分的民主讨论。他们说：以前帝国主义挑拨我们和汉人的关系，现在我们要加强各民族团结，打垮美帝国主义。他们在爱国公约上写着：“做好民族团结工作，粉碎敌人挑拨阴谋。”此外，他们在爱国公约上还规定了做好农业生产、加紧时事学习等。
    新疆绥来县哈族牧民今年由于订立了爱国公约，特地从一百里外的深山中赶到县城去缴纳税款，结果使国家的税收任务提前完成。
    各少数民族人民在优待烈士家属和革命军人家属的工作上，也已经做出了良好的成绩，例如云南腾冲县各族人民曾替军人家属助耕四千四百九十多工，并凑集了粮食一万三千五百斤和牛马三十多匹，救济那些生活困难的烈士家属和军人家属。
    各少数民族人民积极地参加抗美援朝运动，这表明了他们热爱祖国，热爱今天幸福的生活。甘肃省临夏专区堡子乡的一个回汉农民互助组在写给毛主席的信上说：“我们全组十七户，从前没有一家人吃过一天饱饭。今年，不但每户都能吃得饱，穿得暖，而且全组还买进六头牲畜，新修了五间楼房和十六间平房。从前我们的娃娃没有一个上过学，今年就有十个男孩和四个女孩入校读书了。这样美好的生活我们不能让美国侵略者来破坏，因此我们一定要加紧增产，努力支援中国人民志愿军。”这是中国各民族人民共同的心声，也是中国人民抗美援朝的力量的泉源。（新华社）
