    It has been three years since the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace convened in Wrocław, Poland, and initiated an international movement to avert a new war. A powerful, organized front of peace fighters has emerged, uniting hundreds of millions of working people, scientists, and cultural figures under its banner in a short period of time. This front is a force capable of thwarting the evil conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers.

    The Stockholm Appeal signature campaign, which concluded at the end of last year, pointed out that atomic weapons are weapons of terror and mass murder, should be banned, and advocated condemning the first government to use atomic bombs as a war criminal. More than 500 million people around the world signed this appeal. In February 1951, the World Peace Council launched a new and larger movement demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and in a few months, nearly 450 million people wrote their names on the World Peace Council's declaration.

    The rapid expansion of the ranks of peace fighters and the all-round support of all advanced and progressive humanity for the various measures of the World Peace Council vividly demonstrate the unparalleled vitality and irresistible power of the movement of the broad masses of people in all countries to safeguard peace and avert a new war. Comrade Stalin said, "The peoples of all countries do not want to repeat the catastrophe of war. They are unswervingly fighting to strengthen world peace and security."

    Demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact is the focus of the struggle for peace at this stage. All adult residents of the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries have unanimously expressed their support for the peace pact. More than 13 million citizens of the German Democratic Republic have expressed their opposition to the rearmament of Germany and voted in favor of a peaceful solution to the German question. The movement "Oppose the rearmament of Japan and demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty" has mobilized the broad masses of the Japanese people and the people of other Asian countries.

    On August 28, the plenary session of the Soviet Peace Committee decided to collect signatures in the Soviet Union for the World Peace Council's declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. The Soviet people—the heroic builders of communism in the Soviet Union—and the Soviet government are deeply concerned about maintaining and consolidating peace. They are marching at the forefront of the world movement for peace, and they consistently and firmly safeguard the cause of peace and friendship among nations, opposing all encroachments by imperialist robbers. There is no doubt that all the Soviet people will unanimously sign the declaration, thus once again demonstrating their determination to safeguard the cause of peace and international security to the end under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party; all the Soviet people will repeatedly express their infinite love and respect for Comrade Stalin, the great standard-bearer of peace.

    The people of capitalist countries, regardless of all the terror tactics and despicable propaganda of the imperialist elements, are increasingly resolutely launching the struggle for a peace pact. The people of these countries see that the conclusion of a peace pact would make it possible to establish peaceful cooperation between countries, to end the arms race launched by imperialist aggressor countries, to reduce the heavy burden of war taxes, and to raise the living standards of the working people.

    The people of the colonies and dependent countries are a powerful force in the struggle for peace. They closely combine the struggle for a peace pact with the struggle for national independence, and they demand an end to the heinous imperialist wars of plunder against the freedom-loving people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya.

    The peace front unites more than 800 million men and women in the countries of the democratic and socialist camp. It includes many trade unions, youth organizations, women's organizations, cooperative organizations, cultural organizations, entertainment organizations, and other public organizations, with millions of members worldwide. The working class led by the communist parties of various countries is the unifying force of this peace movement and the fighting vanguard of this peace movement.

    All honest people in the world, all who hate war and cherish the achievements of human culture, are uniting to fight against a handful of warmongers, against multimillionaire tycoons. These millionaires are only enthusiastic about war, because war materials fatten them, and they extract huge profits from the blood of the people.

    Social celebrities and prominent representatives of the scientific and literary circles of various countries are actively participating in the peace movement. The names of these selfless peace fighters are known throughout the world—the names of the Stalin International Peace Prize laureates: Curie, Johnson, Soong Ching Ling, Park Chung Ae, and others. Every country, every day, is producing more and more true people's heroes who are fighting for peace.

    The people of all countries do not want war and hate war. They are increasingly aware of the abyss of terror they face, aware that imperialism and its lackeys—the anti-people governments of the United States, Britain, France, and other capitalist countries—want to push them into this abyss. The bloody war launched by the US imperialists in Korea has now been going on for nearly fifteen months. The American aggressors and butchers have been defeated, and in order to vent their anger, they are taking it out on the peaceful residents of Korea. They are using jet planes and time bombs, using chemical and bacteriological weapons, and deliberately exterminating Korean women, children, and the elderly. These modern cannibals in US and British army uniforms—their barbarity and cruelty simply exceed all crimes in history.

    While continuing the war in Korea, threatening the People's Republic of China, and preparing new acts of aggression, the warmongers are intensifying their despicable propaganda to slander the countries of peace, democracy, and socialism and the movement of peace fighters. The reactionary bourgeois newspapers and radio stations hired by the warmongers are daily inciting war hysteria in capitalist countries, repeatedly instilling the poisonous "idea" that war is inevitable, urging their people to launch predatory conquests against peace-loving people, and distorting the facts in various ways, attempting to viciously "prove" that the bloody acts of aggression by US imperialism are correct, in order to trap the people of all countries in a web of lies and allow the warmongers to do whatever they want. The right-wing social democrats and Titoites, the lackeys of imperialism, are the most hateful accomplices in the imperialist conspiracies against peace and humanity, and they are trying to slander the peace camp, using despicable lies, saying that US imperialism is "progressive," that imperialism is right to prepare another war "because of the needs of national defense," and so on.

    It is clear that the more vigilant the people of all countries are, the more courageous and resolute the actions of peace advocates are, thus exposing the evil conspiracies and lies of the aggressors, and giving due response to every attack of the enemies of peace, the less likely it is that the warmongers will realize their evil plans.

    The forces of peace are strong. The reserves of the army of peace fighters are infinite. It is up to the peace advocates to intensify their activities to constantly bring new strata of the people to actively participate in the struggle against war. Peace movement activists, signature collectors, and agitators constantly carry out propaganda work among the people, which will make everyone understand the great significance of peace, will help even the most backward and wavering people understand the nature of the peace movement, this movement welcomes all who desire to participate; it will help them understand the importance of every signature on the peace pact declaration.

    The international peace movement is further expanding its mass base, uniting its ranks, and absorbing broader strata of the people into the struggle for peace. It will surely accomplish its historical mission: to stop the aggressors and thwart the imperialists' plan to launch another world war.

    当代的不可抵抗的运动
    （《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第一○八期社论）
    自从世界文化工作者拥护和平大会在波兰弗劳兹拉夫召开，发起组织国际运动来避免新战争以来，已经有三年了。一个强大的、有组织的、和平战士的阵线出现了，它在短短的时间内，就把亿万劳动人民、科学和文化界人士团结在它的旗帜下面。这个阵线是一个能够挫败帝国主义战争制造者的罪恶阴谋的力量。
    斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名运动，是去年年底结束的。宣言指出原子武器是制造恐怖和大规模杀人的武器，应禁止使用，主张谴责首先使用原子弹的政府为战争罪犯。全世界五亿多人在这宣言上签了名。一九五一年二月，世界和平理事会发起了要求五大国缔结和平公约的、规模更大的新的运动，在几个月之内，将近四亿五千万人在世界和平理事会的宣言上写下了他们的名字。
    和平战士的队伍这样地迅速扩大起来，全体先进的、进步的人类这样地在各方面支持世界和平理事会的种种措施——这鲜明地证明了世界各国广大人民群众维护和平和避免新战争的运动，有充沛无比的生气和不可抵抗的威力。斯大林同志说，“世界各国人民都不愿意重复一次战争的浩劫。他们正在坚持不渝地为加强世界和平与安全而奋斗。”
    要求五大国缔结和平公约，是现阶段争取和平的斗争的重心。中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的全体成年居民，已经一致表示拥护和平公约。德意志民主共和国有一千三百万以上的公民，已经表示反对重新武装德国，投票赞成和平解决德国问题。“反对重新武装日本、要求缔结全面和约”的运动，已经动员了日本人民和亚洲其他各国人民的广大群众。
    八月二十八日，苏联和平委员会全体会议决定在苏维埃联邦为世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言征集签名。苏联人民——英雄的在苏联的共产主义建设者，和苏联政府是深切地关心保持和巩固和平的。他们行进在世界争取和平的运动的最前列，他们一贯地、坚定地维护和平和各国人民友好的事业，反对帝国主义强盗的一切侵犯。毫无疑问，全体苏联人民将万众一心地在宣言上签名，这样来又一次表明他们有决心要在列宁—斯大林党的领导下把和平和国际安全的事业维护到底；全体苏联人民将一次又一次地表示他们对伟大的和平旗手斯大林同志的无限敬爱。
    资本主义国家的人民，不顾帝国主义分子的一切恐怖手段和卑鄙的造谣活动，正在日益坚决地展开争取和平公约的斗争。这些国家人民看到，缔结和平公约就有可能建立各国之间的和平合作，有可能结束帝国主义侵略国家所发动的扩军运动，有可能减轻战争捐税的重担，提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    殖民地和附属国人民是争取和平的斗争中的强大力量。他们把争取和平公约的斗争与争取民族独立的斗争密切结合在一起，他们要求结束对朝鲜、越南和马来亚的热爱自由的人民的罪恶的帝国主义掠夺战争。
    和平阵线团结了民主和社会主义阵营国家的八亿以上的男女。它包括许多工会、青年团体、妇女团体、合作团体、文化团体、文娱团体以及其他公共团体，在全世界拥有千百万的会员。各国共产党领导的工人阶级是这个和平运动的团结力量，也是这个和平运动的战斗的先锋。
    世界上一切正直的人们，一切憎恶战争、珍惜人类文化的成就的人们正团结起来为反对一小撮的战争制造者、反对家财亿万的富翁而斗争。这些富翁只热心于战争，因为战争物资把他们养肥了，他们从人民的血液中吸取了巨大的利润。
    各国的社会名流以及科学和文艺界的卓越代表，都在积极地参加和平运动。全世界都知道这些忘我的和平战士的名字——“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获得者的名字：居里、约翰逊、宋庆龄、朴正爱以及其他一些人士。每个国家，每天都在涌现出更多的争取和平的真正人民英雄。
    各国人民不要战争，并且恨战争。他们日益认识到他们所面临的恐怖深渊，认识到帝国主义及其走狗——美国、英国、法国以及其他资本主义国家的反人民政府——想把他们推入这个深渊。美英帝国主义者在朝鲜所发动的血腥战争现在已经进行了近十五个月了。美国侵略者和屠夫遭到了失败，为了发泄他们的愤怒，他们正在找朝鲜的和平居民出气。他们使用喷气式飞机和定时炸弹，使用化学和细菌武器，蓄意消灭朝鲜的妇女、儿童和老年人。这些穿着美国和英国军队制服的现代吃人生番——他们的野蛮与残暴的程度简直超过了有史以来的一切罪行。
    战争贩子们一方面在朝鲜继续进行战争，威胁中华人民共和国并准备新的侵略行动，一方面加紧卑鄙的造谣活动，来诽谤和平、民主和社会主义国家，诽谤和平战士的运动。战争贩子所雇佣的反动资产阶级报纸和广播电台，每天都在资本主义国家颠倒黑白地煽动战争歇斯底里，反复地灌输有毒的战争不可避免的“思想”，要他们的人民对爱好和平的人民进行掠夺性的征伐，用各种各样的方法歪曲事实，企图恶毒地“证明”美帝国主义的血腥侵略行为是对的，以便使各国人民陷入谎言的罗网，使战争贩子们得以为所欲为。帝国主义走狗右翼社会党人和铁托分子，是帝国主义阴谋反对和平和人类的最可恶的帮凶，他们企图中伤和平阵营，拿一些卑鄙的谎话，说什么美帝国主义是“进步的”，“因为国防的需要”等等，来证明帝国主义准备另一次战争是正确的。
    很清楚，各国人民的警惕性愈高，和平拥护者的行动愈勇敢、愈坚决，这样来揭露侵略者的罪恶阴谋和谎言，对和平的敌人的每一个进攻给予应有的回击，那末，战争贩子实现他们的罪恶计划的可能性也就愈少。
    和平的力量是强大的。和平战士大军的后备力量是无穷的。不断地使新的人民阶层积极参加反对战争的斗争端赖和平拥护者的加紧活动。和平运动的积极分子、签名征集员和鼓动员不断在人民中间开展宣传工作，将会使每一个人懂得和平的伟大意义，将会帮助甚至最落后的和意志不定的人民懂得和平运动的性质，这个运动欢迎一切渴望参加的人们；将会帮助他们懂得在和平公约宣言上的每一个签名的重要意义。
    国际和平运动正在进一步扩大它的群众基础，团结它的队伍，把更广大的人民阶层吸收到争取和平的斗争中来。它一定将完成它的历史任务：制止侵略者，挫败帝国主义者发动另一次世界战争的计划。
