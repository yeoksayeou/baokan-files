To the Editor:

An Tu County's Sixth District is one of the important forest regions of Jilin Province. The Deputy District Chief of this district, Jiang Bingzhang, not only fails to educate the masses to protect the forest trees, but also abuses his power to condone the masses' destruction of forest trees. In February of this year, the district government, in order to solve the fuel problem, did not apply for approval from the higher authorities, but signed a contract with the masses to cut two hundred zhang of firewood (firewood for burning). At first, the district government told the masses that they should cut as much rotten wood, diseased wood, and crooked wood that is not suitable for timber as possible. However, when the masses later requested to cut new trees for firewood, Jiang Bingzhang actually agreed, saying, "You can cut some new ones." From beginning to end, the district government never went to the logging forest to check, so the forest was severely damaged. In the forest, an area of ​​one and a half qing was completely cut down, the stumps reached three chi three cun, and the treetops were not utilized. Of the two hundred zhang of firewood cut, one hundred and sixty-seven zhang were new timber, including many valuable timber such as ash, pine, and yellow bark. In February, You Xiyuan, a winnowing basket shop in An Tu Street, requested to peel the bark of living trees. Jiang Bingzhang knew that peeling the bark of living trees was an illegal act of destroying forests, but he still approved it. You Xiyuan and others went up the mountain and peeled the bark of one thousand eight hundred and forty-four living trees. Comrade Wu Changji of the County Forestry Section discovered this situation and immediately stopped it, and took the bark peelers to the district government for Jiang Bingzhang to deal with. Who knew that Jiang Bingzhang had a tough attitude, and said, "I approved the peeling of the bark, I will be responsible if heads roll." He told the bark peelers to take the bark back, and said, we will develop this sideline production in the future. According to the government's clear provisions, it is strictly forbidden to peel the bark of living trees and cut new timber for firewood. I suggest that the relevant authorities give appropriate treatment to Jiang Bingzhang's behavior of knowing the law and violating it. The district government's act of signing a contract with the masses to cut firewood without approval should also be examined.

    安图第六区姜秉章副区长知法犯法破坏林木应予处分编辑同志：
    安图县第六区是吉林省重要林区之一。该区副区长姜秉章不但不教育群众保护林木，反利用职权，放任群众破坏林木。今年二月间，该区区政府为解决燃料问题，不呈请上级批准，即与群众订立合同，打柈子（烧火用的劈柴）二百丈。该区区政府起初对群众说，应尽可能打腐朽木、病虫木及不成材的弯曲木。但后来群众请求放新树打柈子时，姜秉章竟答应说：“可以打点新的。”从开始到终了，区政府从来没有到采伐林木的林场上去检查过，因此，林场遭到严重破坏。林场中有一垧半面积全被伐光，伐根达到三尺三寸，梢头木也没有利用。所打二百丈柈子中，有一百六十七丈是新木材，其中不少是水曲柳、松木、黄波罗等珍贵木材。二月间，安图街簸箕铺尤喜元请求扒活树皮，姜秉章明知扒活树皮是毁林的犯法行为，但仍然批准。尤喜元等上山扒掉一千八百四十四棵活树的树皮。县政府林政科吴昌吉同志发现了这种情况，立即加以制止，并将扒树皮的人带到区政府，让姜秉章处理。谁知姜秉章态度强硬，竟说：“扒树皮是我批准的，掉脑袋由我负责。”他把树皮叫扒树皮的人带回去，还说，我们今后还要发展这种副业生产呢。按政府早有明文规定，严禁扒活树皮及采伐新材当柴烧。我建议有关机关，对姜秉章这种知法犯法的行为，予以适当处理。该区区政府不经批准，擅自与群众订合同打柈子，也应检讨。
