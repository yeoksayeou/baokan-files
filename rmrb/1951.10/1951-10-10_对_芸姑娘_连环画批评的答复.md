Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    To the Editors:
    The criticism by Comrade Shi Cunlong, published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on September 18th, regarding the comic book "Girl Yun" published by our store, is completely correct. We now provide the following response regarding our store's handling of the "Girl Yun" comic book:

    1. In mid-June of last year, upon discovering that the "Girl Yun" comic book distorted the land reform policy, our store immediately notified all fellow businesses to cease sales. Of the initial print run of 3,000 copies, 1,831 had already been distributed, and there have been no further printings since.

    2. Our store's research office has two staff members dedicated to reviewing new books. Since September, we have been inspecting previously published books and processing them according to their content and the severity of the errors. We have decided to: cease distribution of books with fundamental errors in content; notify publishers to revise books with partial errors before re-issuing them; notify publishers to revise stories with educational value but with some inappropriate wording or illustrations upon reprinting; allow stories that are bland and have very crude text and illustrations to be sold until stock is exhausted, notifying publishers not to reprint; and continue to distribute books with excellent content.

    This time, thanks to Comrade Shi Cunlong's enthusiastic criticism, our inspection work has been greatly advanced. Due to the insufficient political level of our staff, we anticipate that there will still be shortcomings in our future work, and we hope that readers will offer many suggestions.

### 对“芸姑娘”连环画批评的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对“芸姑娘”连环画批评的答复编辑同志：
    九月十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏内刊登的施存龙同志对我店发行的连环图画“芸姑娘”的批评，是完全正确的。现把我店对“芸姑娘”连环画的处理情形答复如下：
    一、我店于去年六月中旬发现“芸姑娘”连环画内容歪曲了土地改革政策，即通知各同业不要出售。该书初版三千本已发行了一千八百三十一本，以后没有再版。
    二、我店研究室有二位工作同志专门审阅新书。自九月份起，即对过去发行的图书加以检查，并按内容和错误的程度分别加以处理。已决定：内容有原则性错误的停止发行；内容有部分错误的，通知出版社修正后再发行；故事有教育意义，但文字或画面有部分不妥的地方，通知出版社于重版时修正之；故事平淡、文字图画均极粗糙者，售完为止，通知出版社不必重版；内容优良者继续发行。
    这次由于施存龙同志的热心批评，使我们的检查工作大大地推进了一步。我们限于工作同志政治水平不够，估计今后工作仍然会有缺点，希望读者多多提出意见。
