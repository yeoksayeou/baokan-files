Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, received a letter from the famous American progressive writer Howard Fast, expressing his regret that he could not come to China to participate in the National Day celebration due to the restrictions of the reactionary rulers of the United States. Chairman Guo Moruo has replied to Fast after receiving the letter.

Fast's letter is as follows: Dear Guo Moruo,

I received your telegram, and I read it with pride and regret. Pride that you gave me such an invitation; regret that I cannot attend this ceremony, which has such great significance for the place I earnestly hope to see.

However, you know that I am a kind of prisoner under house arrest, restricted within the borders of the continental United States. I cannot cross the borders of my country; the State Department has taken away my passport. All hope of traveling anywhere until happier days arrive has vanished.

But please believe that where my body cannot go, my heart goes. In this great struggle for peace and the future of mankind, in your efforts to rebuild your country and turn it into a beautiful and happy place that people dream of, my heart is with you. Even if I cannot come, I can extend my warmest congratulations to you to celebrate this anniversary. Even if I cannot come, I can extend my hand to so many peace-loving, benevolent Chinese people who respect humanity, and you must understand that I am not alone in this. This is a feeling deeply felt by millions of good and brave Americans, who are peace-loving, and they will work for peace and fight for peace.

Howard Fast, New York, September 4, 1951.

Guo Moruo's reply is as follows: Dear friend Mr. Fast,

I received the copy of your letter given to me by your friend. However, I did not receive the original letter sent directly to me. This proves that your consideration was very thoughtful. Your freedom of communication is obviously restricted. We are very sorry that you and Robertson cannot come to China. But our hands are always tightly clasped, and no obstruction can separate us. We believe that one day we will welcome you to China. We are working together for this beautiful future. Greetings.

Guo Moruo, September 25, 1951

    因受美反动派限制不能应邀前来我国
    法斯特致函郭沫若热烈祝贺我国庆节
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若收到美国著名进步作家法斯特的来信，对于因美国反动统治者的限制而不能前来我国参加国庆节庆祝典礼，表示遗憾。郭沫若主席接到来信后已函覆法斯特。
    法斯特来信如下：亲爱的郭沫若：
    我收到了你的电报，我以骄傲与遗憾的心情读了它。骄傲的是你竟然给了我这样的邀请；遗憾的是我不能参加这个典礼，而这个典礼对于我所恳切期望见到的地方有着这么重大的意义。
    不过，你知道，我是一种受软禁的犯人，被限制在美国大陆国界内。我不能跨出我国家的边界，国务院已拿走了我的护照。在比较幸福的日子到来以前，我不论到何处去旅行的一切希望都成为泡影。
    但是请相信，我身体不能去的地方，我的心去了。在这个为和平与人类未来的伟大斗争中，在你们为重建你们国家并使它变为一个人们理想着的美丽和幸福地方的努力中，我的心是和你们在一起的。纵然我不能前来，我可以向你们致最热烈的祝贺，来庆祝这个周年纪念日。纵然我不能前来，我能够这样向这么许多爱好和平、尊敬人类的善良的中国人民的手伸出我的手，你也一定了解，在这点上我不是孤独的。这是千百万善良勇敢的美国人民所深深体会到的一部分，这些善良勇敢的人民是爱好和平的，他们将为和平而工作，为和平而斗争。
            法斯特一九五一年九月四日于纽约。
    郭沫若复信如下：亲爱的朋友法斯特先生：
    你给我的信的副本，由你的朋友转来的，我收到了。可是你的信的正本直接寄给我，我却没有收到。这就证明你的考虑是十分周到的。你的通信自由都很明显地受到了限制。你同罗伯逊都不能到中国来，我们非常遗憾。可是我们的手是永远紧握着的，任何阻挠都不能够隔断我们。我们相信总有一天会在中国欢迎着你。我们正为着这个美好的将来共同努力。敬礼
            郭沫若一九五一年九月二十五日
