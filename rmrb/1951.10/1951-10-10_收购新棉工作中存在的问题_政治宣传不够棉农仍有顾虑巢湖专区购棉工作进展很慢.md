    Problems Existing in the Acquisition of New Cotton
    Political Propaganda Insufficient, Cotton Farmers Still Have Concerns, Cotton Purchase Work in Chaohu Prefecture Progressing Very Slowly
    In the cotton purchase work in Chaohu Prefecture, northern Anhui, there are some problems, which make the acquisition work progress very slowly. The most important of these problems is: the masses have some ideological concerns about the cotton purchase work; some leading organs and cadres have not eliminated the ideological concerns of the masses. On the contrary, they have adopted a commandist approach to the masses, which has further aggravated the ideological concerns of the masses.
    The Chaohu Prefectural Cotton Purchase Committee was established in mid-August. The counties of the prefecture also successively formed cotton purchase committees and convened meetings of cadres at all levels and various representative meetings (such as cotton farmer representative meetings, cooperative member representative meetings, party and League member representative meetings, and propagandist representative meetings) to arrange cotton purchase work. After the new cotton was put on the market in early September, the counties began to purchase it. However, because the work was not deeply rooted in the masses and political propaganda and education were not widely carried out, the masses still had many doubts and concerns about selling cotton. For example, they were unwilling to sell early and waited to sell at a higher price; they were afraid of being called rich peasants and changing their status if they sold too much cotton; they were afraid of rising prices and thought it was better to store cotton than money; they were afraid of not being able to buy necessities after selling cotton, and so on. A small number of illegal merchants speculated by raising prices to snap up cotton and carry out sabotage propaganda, which further fueled the farmers' reluctance to sell. Some leading organs did not address the ideological concerns of the masses, carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization, and strengthen market management to crack down on the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants. Instead, they adopted administrative orders and mandatory quotas in their work. For example, when Lujiang assigned cotton purchase tasks to villages, the village cadres assigned the tasks to each household. They also said that this was "new patriotism," and failure to complete the task was unpatriotic. Some masses who did not grow cotton had to buy cotton on the market to complete the task. Militiamen in Liangyuan District, Feidong, forcibly pulled cotton farmers to the cooperative to sell cotton. The cotton farmers who sold cotton said: "I won't sell it, I'll take the cotton home!"
    In response to the above-mentioned problems, the Chaohu Prefectural Cotton Purchase Committee issued "Instructions on the Current Cotton Purchase Work," proposing that to complete the cotton purchase task, it is necessary to mobilize the intermediate elements and a small number of backward elements who make up the majority of the masses to join the movement. This requires hard propaganda and mobilization work to implement the policies; at the same time, market management should be strengthened, prices should be appropriately controlled, and the illegal activities of private merchants should be banned.

    收购新棉工作中存在的问题
    政治宣传不够棉农仍有顾虑巢湖专区购棉工作进展很慢
    皖北巢湖专区购棉工作中，存在着一些问题，以致收购工作进度很慢。这些问题中最重要的是：群众对于购棉工作，存有若干思想顾虑；某些领导机关及干部没有解除群众的思想顾虑，相反的，对群众实行命令主义的作法，结果更加重了群众的思想顾虑。
    巢湖专区购棉委员会，在八月中旬就成立了。该专区各县也先后组成购棉委员会，并召开各级干部会议及各种代表会议（如棉农代表会、合作社员代表会、党团员代表会、宣传员代表会）布置购棉工作。九月初旬新棉上市后，各县即开始收购。但由于工作没有深入群众，政治宣传教育没有广泛展开，因此，群众对售棉尚有不少的怀疑和顾虑。如不愿早售，等卖高价；售棉多了，怕人家说是富农，改变成份，怕物价上涨，存钱不如存棉；怕卖了棉花，买不到必需品等等。少数不法商人投机抬价抢购并进行破坏宣传，更助长了农民的惜售心理。某些领导机关没有针对群众的思想顾虑，进行深入地宣传动员，并加强市场管理，打击奸商的不法活动，却在工作中采取了行政命令、强迫摊派的办法。如庐江布置购棉任务到村时，村干部即将任务摊派给各户。还说这是“新爱国主义”，不完成任务，就是不爱国。有些没种棉花的群众，只得到市场现买棉花，完成任务。肥东梁园区民兵强拉棉农到合作社卖棉，卖棉花的棉农说：“不卖了，把棉花挑回家去！”
    巢湖专区购棉委员会针对以上存在问题，特发出“关于目前购棉工作的指示”，提出：要完成购棉任务，必须把占群众多数的中间分子和少数落后分子，一齐发动起来，投入运动。这就须要进行艰苦的宣传动员工作，把政策贯彻下去；同时应加强市场管理，适当掌握价格，取缔私商的非法活动。
