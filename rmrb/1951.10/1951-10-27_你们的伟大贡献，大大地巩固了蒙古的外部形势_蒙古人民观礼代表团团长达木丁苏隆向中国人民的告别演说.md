Your Great Contributions Have Greatly Consolidated Mongolia's External Situation
-- Farewell Speech to the Chinese People by Damdinsuren, Head of the Mongolian People's Delegation

Before leaving Beijing to return to his country, Damdinsuren, the head of the Mongolian People's Delegation, was invited by the Central People's Broadcasting Station to deliver a farewell speech to the Chinese people. The recording of the speech was broadcast on the 26th, and the text of the speech is as follows:

China is great. The spirit of the Chinese people is like the magnificent flow of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. China has a large population and a long history. The scale of the construction undertakings currently being carried out by the Chinese people is unprecedented in Chinese history.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have shattered the evil conspiracy of American imperialism, which vainly attempts to dominate the world and encroach upon Asia, and established the People's Republic of China. The new China has achieved admirable results in its construction over the past two years, such as curbing inflation, stabilizing prices, implementing land reform, and building water conservancy projects. Various construction undertakings are currently continuing to develop vigorously.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Mao Zedong, the people of all strata in China, headed by the working class, are united everywhere. The presence of such a strong, just, and democratic country in Asia is a major contribution to the cause of the people of Asia and the world. Heroic Chinese working people! The great achievements you have created have strengthened the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. Chinese people – our brothers! Your great contributions have greatly consolidated Mongolia's external situation. Marshal Choibalsan, the leader of the Mongolian people, once said: The historic victory of the Chinese revolution has further consolidated the external situation of the independent and autonomous Mongolian People's Republic and opened a new era in the relationship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples. I came to China on behalf of the Mongolian people and felt the brotherly care of the Chinese people for the Mongolian people and the excitement they felt about the development of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Mongolian people, who are building their new lives with the help of the Soviet people and the great Lenin and Stalin, earnestly hope that the Chinese people will achieve even greater success in the process of building their own country. We are united in our goals and policies in the struggle for peace and for the great unity of the people of all countries. Finally, on behalf of the Mongolian people, I extend my sincere congratulations to the Chinese people.

    你们的伟大贡献，大大地巩固了蒙古的外部形势
    ——蒙古人民观礼代表团团长达木丁苏隆向中国人民的告别演说
    蒙古人民观礼代表团团长达木丁苏隆在离北京返国前，应中央人民广播电台之邀向中国人民发表告别演说，演说的录音已在二十六日广播，演词如下：
    中国是伟大的。中国人民的气魄，如同黄河、长江的雄壮的奔流。中国有众多的人口和悠久的历史。中国人民目前正在进行的建设事业的规模，在中国历史上是空前的。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，粉碎了妄想独霸世界、侵吞亚洲的美帝国主义的罪恶阴谋，创立了中华人民共和国。新中国两年来的建设有了令人敬佩的成绩，如制止了通货膨胀，稳定了物价，实行了土地改革和修建了水利事业等。各项建设事业目前正在蓬勃地继续发展中。
    在中国共产党和伟大的毛泽东的领导下，以工人阶级为首的中国各阶层人民，到处表现着团结一致。亚洲有了这样强大、正义、民主的国家，对亚洲和全世界人民的事业是一个最大的贡献。英雄的中国劳动人民！你们所创造的丰功伟业，已经加强了以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营。中国人民——我们的弟兄！你们的伟大贡献，已大大地巩固了蒙古的外部形势。蒙古人民的领袖乔巴山元帅曾经说：中国革命的历史性的胜利，更巩固了独立自主的蒙古人民共和国的外部形势，给蒙古人民和中国人民的关系开辟了新的纪元。我代表蒙古人民来到中国，体会到了中国人民对蒙古人民的兄弟般的关怀，和对蒙古人民共和国的发展所感到的兴奋。在苏联人民和伟大的列宁、斯大林的帮助下建设起自己的新生活的蒙古人民，热烈地希望中国人民在建设自己国家的过程中，获得更大的成绩。我们在为和平、为各国人民的大团结而奋斗的目的和方针上是一致的。最后，我代表蒙古人民，向中国人民致以诚挚的祝贺。
