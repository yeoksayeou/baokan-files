Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a TASS dispatch from London: Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, on the 4th called on the British people to stop the Korean War, just as they "stopped the war against the Soviet Union in 1920."

Pollitt spoke at a lively election rally in London. He pointed out that the Americans are in a frantic state of despair at their inability to defeat the Korean people. Pollitt called on the British people to demand the withdrawal of all British and British Commonwealth troops from Korea and to demand an immediate meeting of the Security Council to insist on a ceasefire agreement based on the 38th parallel and the conclusion of a peace treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th: The New York "Worker's Daily" published an editorial on October 1st entitled "Every Conceivable Obstacle to Peace!" condemning the US conspiracy to sabotage the Kaesong negotiations.

The editorial said: "Ridgway's reasons for opposing Kaesong are obviously very hollow. He says it is difficult to prevent violations of Kaesong's neutrality. If there is any truth to this, then his proposed new location—a location with only a few houses outside the current neutral zone, in the middle of the two front lines—will be even more difficult to prevent."

The editorial said: "Subsequently, General Van Fleet announced a new offensive and said that the only reason we did not intend to fight to the Yalu River in the September offensive was that the North Korean army still had a 'sanctuary' in Manchuria."

"This is tantamount to saying: we have the ability to conquer the entire Korea, and we can achieve this goal with only an agreement to expand the war to Manchuria."

The newspaper pointed out: "This boastful attitude, this eagerness to expand the war, is equivalent to a second MacArthur. Have we forgotten the lives sacrificed and the danger of an Asian war created by MacArthur's policies?"

"This Pentagon strategy is designed to coordinate the second stage of war preparations, marked by the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. Washington is determined to rearm the Japanese warlords and prepare to rearm the Nazis and Italians, even ignoring the protests of its 'allies'."

"The Pentagon believes that in order to implement these malicious plans, regardless of the opposition of these countries and the people of all countries, it is necessary to continue and intensify the state of war in Korea."

In conclusion, the newspaper called on the American people to demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea and to prevent the Senate from ratifying the peace treaty with Japan.

    波立特号召英国人民制止侵朝战争
    纽约工人日报抨击美国破坏谈判
    【新华社六日讯】据电通社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记波立特在四日号召英国人民制止朝鲜战争，像他们“在一九二○年制止对苏联的战争”一样。
    波立特在伦敦一个热烈的竞选集会上讲话。他指出，美国人对于他们没有能力打垮朝鲜人民正感到发狂的绝望。波立特号召英国人民要求把英国和不列颠联邦的所有军队撤出朝鲜，并要求立即召开安全理事会会议，坚持成立以三八线为基础的停火协定和缔结和平公约。
    【新华社布拉格六日电】纽约“工人日报”在十月一日发表题为“千方百计阻挠和平！”的社论，抨击美国破坏开城谈判的阴谋。
    社论说：“李奇微反对开城的理由，显然是很空洞的。他说很难防止侵犯开城中立的事件，如果这话有一点道理，那他所建议的新地点——在目前中立区以外，处于双方战线中间的一个只有几所房屋的地点——将更加难以防止。”
    社论说：“此后，范佛里特将军宣布了一个新攻势，并且说，在九月攻势中，我们没有打算打到鸭绿江的唯一原因是北朝鲜军队在满洲仍有‘庇护地’。”
    “这等于说：我们有能力征服整个朝鲜，我们要达到这个目的，只需有一个同意把战争扩大到满洲去的协议就行了。”
    该报指出：“这种大吹牛皮的态度，这样巴不得扩大战争的态度，等于是第二个麦克阿瑟。难道我们已经忘记了麦克阿瑟政策所牺牲的生命和它所造成的亚洲大战的危险？”
    “五角大楼的这种策略是用来配合以签订对日和约为标志的战争准备的第二阶段的。华盛顿一心要重新武装日本军阀和准备重新武装纳粹与意大利，甚至对于它的‘盟国’的抗议也置之不理。”
    “五角大楼认为，要不顾这些国家以及一切国家的人民的反对而实行这些恶毒的计划，就必须继续并增强朝鲜的战争状态。”
    该报在结语中号召美国人民要求在朝鲜立刻停火，并阻止参院批准对日和约。
