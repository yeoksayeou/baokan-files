Technicians on the Construction Front
——Introducing Industrial Model Workers Sun Yunluan and Others Who Came to Beijing to Participate in the National Day Observance

Among the industrial model workers who came to the capital to participate in the National Day celebrations this year, many are technicians who have made important contributions to the industrial construction of New China. They have boundless love for the motherland and are determined to closely integrate their technical theories with the practical experience of workers. This love and determination enables all New China's technicians to continuously promote their skills and wisdom. Here are four of them: Sun Yunluan, Ma Caijiao, Jin Kui, and Chen Shizhen.

Sun Yunluan, Chief Engineer of the Da Xin Machine Factory under the East China Industrial Department, is the experimenter of "nodular cast iron" in our country. "Nodular cast iron" is an ideal that metallurgists around the world have been trying to achieve for years. Since last year, a few countries such as the Soviet Union have used expensive metals as reactants to produce cast iron similar to steel. However, Sun Yunluan successfully trial-produced "nodular cast iron" using inexpensive magnesium-copper alloy agents. The strength of this "nodular cast iron" exceeds that of high-grade cast iron and ordinary cast steel, and it retains the original cast iron's machinability and damping properties. Its usefulness far exceeds that of malleable iron and cast iron, and it can replace cast steel in the manufacture of train wheels, tools, and various machine parts, etc. Moreover, the casting method is simple and the cost is low. For example, the high-pressure valves cast by the factory using "nodular cast iron" are far superior in quality to imported products. In the past, imported high-pressure valves were required to withstand 1,500 pounds of pressure, but the factory's products exceeded 2,250 pounds, and the cost was about one-half lower than purchasing imported products.

Ma Caijiao, an engineer at Chongqing 101 Steel Plant, successfully trial-produced alkaline pig iron, which is a major technological advancement in increasing steelmaking raw materials. In the past, the raw materials used by the plant to make steel mainly relied on local iron ore or recycled scrap steel, which was very costly. Engineer Ma studied the use of dolomite and limestone to formulate alkaline slag to remove sulfur and silicon, and made other creative reforms. Finally, alkaline pig iron was successfully trial-produced. As a result, the plant's annual steel production exceeded the highest record during the Chiang Kai-shek period by 16 percent, and the cost was also reduced by one-quarter compared to the past.

Chen Shizhen, an engineer at Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory, successfully extracted soft hemp oil using locally produced rapeseed oil and Northeast China-produced diesel oil. The extracted soft hemp oil is no different in quality or effect from the No. 10 red car oil soft hemp, which was previously produced in the United States and was difficult to purchase. This solved the serious difficulties in the use of soft hemp oil in flax mills. The status of American-made No. 10 red car oil in China's flax industry for more than 100 years has since been replaced by domestically produced oil.

Jin Kui, an engineer at Tianjin Automobile Assembly Plant, helped workers successfully test the high-speed cutting method, so that those who had been skeptical about the high-speed cutting method, saying only "Our machines are not good!" and "The hard alloy composition of the tools is not right!" people, have a clearer understanding that only by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can we more quickly improve production efficiency.

The combination of technicians' intelligence and workers' practical experience becomes even richer. Jin Kui, an engineer at Tianjin Automobile Assembly Plant, is an example. Jin Kui doesn't have the "airs" of an engineer and can mingle with workers. He presides over the factory's workers' technical study class, teaching workers technical theory on the one hand, and humbly absorbing practical experience from workers on the other. This year, when the factory promoted the high-speed cutting method, Jin Kui first helped worker Xing Deyu to successfully test it; then he established a research group to promote the high-speed cutting method in the factory. The factory's trial production of a four-cylinder engine was also successful under Jin Kui's technical guidance. In order to complete this arduous task, he worked closely with workers and technicians to imitate and create various necessary tools, samples, etc. The successful trial production of the four-cylinder engine provided the factory with possible conditions for later manufacturing of China's first domestic automobile. Chen Shizhen of Zhejiang Flax Mill encountered many difficulties in the process of researching and manufacturing soft hemp oil, so he often went to the workshops of various departments to understand the situation on the spot, discuss with workers, and absorb production experience. He patiently studied the soft hemp process with workers next to the soft hemp machine. Ma Caijiao, an engineer at Chongqing 101 Steel Plant, also worked closely with the masses of workers under difficult conditions and carefully studied to successfully trial-produce alkaline pig iron. Sun Yunluan, Chief Engineer of Huadong Daxin Machine Factory, said with emotion after he successfully trial-produced the "nodular cast iron" of magnesium-copper alloy agent: "The difference between us and capitalist countries is the unity of technicians and workers. Without the assistance of the workers, my experiment would not have been successful!"

These New China technicians deeply realize the loveliness of the motherland in the Mao Zedong era, and they feel that their technology now has ample opportunities for development. When Chen Shizhen, an engineer at Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory, was studying the problem of soft hemp oil, the factory director fully supported him, and said: "To succeed in the experiment, spending money is inevitable; failure is also possible, but failure is the mother of success." Because of this encouragement, he became more active in his research work, as he himself said: "Without the leadership of the Party, the enthusiastic introduction of production experience by all workers, and the specific help of the factory director and engineers, this kind of research would not be successful."

    建设战线上的技术人员们
    ——介绍来京参加国庆观礼的工业劳动模范孙云鸾等
    今年来首都参加国庆观礼的工业劳动模范中，有不少对新中国工业建设事业有重要贡献的技术人员。他们对祖国无限热爱和决心使自己的技术理论与工人实际经验紧密结合。这种热爱和决心使一切新中国技术人员不断发扬光大他们的技术和智慧。这儿介绍其中的四位，他们是孙云鸾、马彩佼、金奎和陈世桢。
    华东工业部大鑫机器厂总工程师孙云鸾是我国“球墨铸铁”的试炼者。“球墨铸铁”是世界上冶金工作者历年来企图实现的理想。从去年开始，苏联等少数国家用贵重的金属作为反应剂，生产类似钢的铸铁。孙云鸾却用廉价的镁铜合金剂试制“球墨铸铁”成功。这种“球墨铸铁”的强度超过了高级铸铁和普通铸钢，并保持了原有铸铁的切削性和减震性，用度远超过马铁和铸铁，能代替铸钢制造火车轮子、工具和各种机件等，而冶铸方法简易，成本又低。如该厂用“球墨铸铁”浇制的高压凡尔，品质远在舶来品之上。过去舶来品高压凡尔规定耐压一千五百磅，该厂出品超过了二千二百五十磅，成本也比购买舶来品低二分之一左右。
    重庆一○一钢铁厂工程师马彩佼试炼碱性生铁成功，这是增加炼钢原料的一大技术进步。该厂过去炼钢的原料主要是靠乡间土铁或废钢回炉，成本很高。马工程师研究出用白云石和石灰石配制出去硫去矽的碱性渣，并作其他创造性的改革，终于试炼碱性生铁成功，该厂去年度钢的生产量因而超过了蒋匪时期最高纪录百分之十六，成本也比过去降低四分之一。
    浙江麻纺织厂工程师陈世桢用本地产的菜油和东北产的柴油，提炼软麻油成功，提炼出的软麻油和过去美国产而又不易购得的十号红车油软麻，无论在质量上或效用上全不差上下。这就解决了麻纺厂在软麻用油上的严重困难；美国产的十号红车油在中国麻纺业中一百多年的地位，从此也被国产油取而代之。
    天津汽车制配厂工程师金奎，帮助工人们试验高速切削法成功，使曾对高速切削法抱着怀疑，只说
    “咱们的机器不行！”“刀具的硬质合金成份不对！”的人们，更明确认识到，只有学习苏联先进经验，才能使我们更迅速地提高生产效率。
    技术人员的智能和工人的实际经验结合就更加丰富起来。天津汽车制配厂工程师金奎就是一例。金奎没有工程师的“架子”，能和工人打成一片。他主持全厂工人技术学习班，一面向工人讲授技术理论，同时虚心向工人吸取实际经验。今年该厂推行高速切削法时，金奎首先帮助工人邢德禹试验成功；随后又成立研究组，使高速切削法在该厂得到推广。该厂工人试制四缸引擎，也是在金奎的技术指导下成功的。他为了完成这一艰巨任务，曾和工人、技术员密切合作，仿制和创制各种必需的工具、样板等。试制四缸引擎的成功，给该厂后来制成我国第一辆国产汽车提供了可能的条件。浙江麻纺厂的陈世桢在研究制造软麻油过程中，曾遇到很多困难，于是他便经常到车间各部门实地了解情况，同工人讨论，吸收生产经验。他曾在软麻机旁和工人耐心研究软麻过程。重庆一○一钢铁厂工程师马彩佼也是在困难条件下，和工人群众密切合作，精心研究，试炼碱性生铁才得到成功。华东大鑫机器厂总工程师孙云鸾，当他试制镁铜合金剂的
    “球墨铸铁”成功后，曾感动地说：“我们和资本主义国家不同的地方，就是技术员与工人的团结。要不是工人弟兄的协助，我的试验也不会成功的！”
    这些新中国的技术人员们，他们深深地体会到毛泽东时代祖国的可爱，他们感到他们的技术现在有了充分发展的机会。当浙江麻纺织厂工程师陈世桢研究软麻油问题时，该厂厂长全力支持他，并说：“要试验成功，花钱是免不了的；失败也有可能，但失败是成功之母。”由于这种鼓励，他对研究工作更加积极，正如他自己所说：“没有党的领导，全体工人热心介绍生产经验，厂长和工程师们具体帮助，这种研究是不会成功的。”（新华社）
