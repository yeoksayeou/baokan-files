    Strike Down the American Air Bandits!
    People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Jia Chenghong
    I am the political instructor of a anti-aircraft artillery battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The mission of our anti-aircraft artillery battalion is to strike down American air bandits, protect bridges, and ensure the smooth flow of transport supply lines.
    After arriving in Korea, our first battle began on the march: we found our positions, and immediately an enemy plane flew in from the due south, circling low over our heads. At this moment, Communist Party member Comrade Yan Liumao shouted loudly, "Comrades, don't let it get away, our chance to perform meritorious service for the people has arrived, fire!" As soon as he finished shouting, three shells were fired from the position of the First Company. Two shells hit the enemy plane in the fuselage, the enemy plane caught fire, and immediately fell down. Then the comrades of the First Company shot down another enemy B-29 heavy bomber.
    After this battle, the comrades' confidence was further increased.
    In Shibianli, we accepted the glorious task of protecting the bridge. On June 5th, four enemy planes pounced on us, and the comrades of the First Company shot down an enemy B-25 medium bomber with two shells, and then shot down two enemy fighter planes. Later, the enemy sent seven light bombers to bomb and strafe us, and we shot down another one, severely hitting the American air bandits. Our battalion shot down a total of twelve enemy planes and damaged thirteen.
    All the officers and soldiers of our battalion are ready at any time to meet the American air bandits. Defend our great motherland!

    打击美国空中强盗！
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  贾成红
    我是中国人民志愿军某高射炮营的营指导员，我们高射炮营的任务是打击美国空中强盗，保护桥梁，保证运输供应线畅通。
    到朝鲜后，我们第一次的战斗是在行军的路上开始的：我们找好了阵地，马上就有一架敌机从正南方飞来，在我们头上低飞盘旋。这时，共产党员颜六毛同志大声叫起来：“同志们，不要让它跑掉，我们为人民立功的机会到了，打呀！”他刚喊完，从一连的阵地上就发出了三颗炮弹，两发炮弹打中了敌机的腰部，敌机着了火，马上就跌了下来。接着一连的同志又打下来敌人的一架B二十九重轰炸机。
    经过这一次战斗，同志们的信心更加提高了。
    在市边里，我们接受了保卫桥梁的光荣任务。六月五日，四架敌机向我们扑来，一连的同志用两发炮弹，就击落了一架敌人的B二十五中型轰炸机，接着又击落了敌人的两架战斗机。后来，敌人又派来七架轻型轰炸机向我们轰炸、扫射，又被我们击落了一架，严重地打击了美国空中强盗。我们这个营，一共击落敌机十二架，击伤十三架。
    我们全营指战员随时准备着迎击美国空中强盗。保卫我们伟大的祖国！
