Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 20th—All workers of the private Minfeng Yarn Factory in Changzhou, Southern Jiangsu Province, wrote a letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, reporting on their achievements in increasing production during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, as a gift to congratulate the Volunteer Army on the great victory achieved in the first anniversary of fighting abroad. The letter said:

    "Dear Volunteer Army Comrades: You have been fighting abroad for almost a year. Over the past year, encouraged by your great victories, we have also achieved many successes on the production front: During the patriotic labor competition in April and May this year, we increased the output per spindle per 24 hours from 0.88 pounds to 1.1 pounds, while reducing the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn from 433 catties to 415 catties. In terms of increased production and donations, we saved raw cotton and materials worth 220 million yuan in August and September, overfulfilling the plan for saving and donating. We have also signed a contract with the capitalists to increase the production of yarn and cloth worth more than 700 million yuan within six months, and use 30 percent of the proceeds to purchase airplanes and artillery to support you!

    "We were able to achieve these results entirely because we were inspired by your great patriotism. All the workers in our factory regard your selfless patriotic actions as the best example for us to learn from. When we launched the increased production and donation labor competition in early August, some parts were rusty because we had just stopped work for the summer, and the yarn spun was uneven, like big bellies and small braids. We were all very anxious. However, we were not discouraged. The workers said: 'The Volunteer Army is fighting back against the American devils in the freezing cold, hungry, and braving artillery fire. Can't we overcome these difficulties?' Therefore, everyone came up with many solutions, such as forming mutual aid groups and establishing technical research associations in each workshop to prevent the machines from malfunctioning. Sha Fengmei, a female worker in the roving frame workshop, got blisters all over her hands while wiping the rust off the spindle shells. The group leader advised her to rest before wiping again. She said: 'The Volunteer Army doesn't leave the front line even when they are injured. These blisters of mine are nothing!' Encouraged by this patriotic enthusiasm, we overcame all difficulties and overfulfilled the savings and donation plan.

    "Dear Volunteer Army Comrades, every victory of yours brings us the greatest joy. Our newspaper reading group always reads the war news and dispatches from Korea first. Once, after the Wang Peiwen newspaper reading group read the story of a soldier who killed sixteen American devils with sixteen bullets, the workers said: If we had sent the airplanes and artillery to the Volunteer Army earlier, more American devils would have died. When we work in the workshop, we always encourage each other: 'Work hard! Increase production of airplanes and artillery to kill more American devils.' All the workers in our factory firmly believe that with such an excellent and brave People's Volunteer Army as yours, victory will surely belong to us.

    "Each of us has experienced that without you, we would not be able to live this peaceful life. Our respect and love for you cannot be described in words. Let us give you an example: When Jiang Lingdi, a female worker in the weaving machine workshop, was weaving cloth, she would rather get machine oil all over herself than let a single oil stain get on the cloth. She said: 'This cloth is woven to support the Volunteer Army, and we can't be negligent at all. The clothes are my own, and they will be clean after washing.'

    "Finally, we would also like to tell you a piece of good news: We wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on National Day to say hello to him. Today, he has replied to us, encouraging us to consolidate our existing achievements, continue to improve technology and product quality, and strive to produce more finished products. We will firmly remember Chairman Mao's words, and at the same time assure you: We will never be complacent because of our existing achievements. As long as American imperialism does not give up its aggressive ambitions, we will not relax our Resist America, Aid Korea work for a single day. After the six-month increased production and donation plan is completed, we will find other ways to continue to support you!"

    常州私营民丰纱厂工人写信给志愿军
    报告抗美援朝运动中增加生产的成绩
    祝贺志愿军出国作战一年的伟大胜利
    【新华社无锡二十日电】苏南区常州市私营民丰纱厂全体工人写信给志愿军，报告他们在抗美援朝运动中增加生产的成绩，作为祝贺志愿军出国作战一周年所获得的伟大胜利的献礼。信中说：
    “亲爱的志愿军同志们：你们出国作战将近一年了。一年来，在你们伟大胜利的鼓舞下，我们在生产战线上也获得了很多成绩：在今年四、五两月的爱国主义劳动竞赛中，我们将每枚纱锭每二十四小时的产量从○·八八磅增加到一·一磅，而每件纱的用棉量却从四百三十三斤降低到四百十五斤。在增产捐献方面，我们在八、九两月共计节约了价值二亿二千万元的原棉和物料，超额完成了节约捐献的计划。我们并且已与资方订立了合同，计划在半年内增产价值七亿余元的纱布，以其中的百分之三十的款项购买飞机大炮来支援你们！
    “我们能够得到这些成绩，完全是因为你们的伟大的爱国主义精神所感召。我们全厂工人都以你们忘我的爱国行动，作为自己学习的最好榜样。八月初，我们开展增产捐献劳动竞赛的时候，因为刚经过夏季停工，有些机件生了锈，纺出来的纱都像大肚皮和小辫子，一点也不匀，我们都急得双脚直跳。但是，我们并不气馁，工友们说：‘志愿军在冰天雪地中饿着肚子，冒着炮火，也把美国鬼子打退了，我们这点困难就不能克服吗？’因此，大家想出了很多办法，如成立了互助组，每个车间里建立了技术研究会，不让机器出一点毛病。粗纱间女工沙凤美在擦锭壳上的锈时，满手出了泡。小组长劝她歇歇再擦。她说：‘志愿军在阵地上受了伤还不下火线，我这点泡算不了什么！’在这种爱国热情的鼓舞下，我们克服了一切困难，超额完成了节约捐献计划。
    “亲爱的志愿军同志，你们的每一个胜利都使我们感到最大的快乐。我们的读报组每次读报时，总是先读朝鲜的战讯和通讯。有一回，王培文读报小组在读了你们有一个战士用十六发子弹打死十六个美国鬼子的故事后，工友们都说：如果我们把飞机大炮早些送给志愿军，美国鬼子死得还要多。我们在车间做工时，总是互相鼓励着：‘用心做呀！多增产飞机大炮多打死美国鬼子。’我们全厂工友深深地相信：有了像你们这样优秀而勇敢的人民志愿军，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    “我们每一个人都体验到，没有你们，我们是不可能过这种和平的生活的，我们对你们的敬爱是不能用言语形容的。我们举一个例子：布机间女工蒋苓弟在织布时，她宁愿自己身上沾满了机油，也不让一点油渍沾在布上。她说：‘这布是为了支援志愿军而织的，一点也不能疏忽。衣服是我自己的，洗一下就干净了。’
    “最后，我们还要告诉你们一件喜事：我们在国庆节写了一封信给毛主席，向他问好。今天他有回信来了，鼓励我们要巩固已有成绩，继续提高技术和产品质量，为生产更多的成品而努力。我们一定牢牢记住毛主席的话，同时向你们提出保证：我们决不因现有的成绩而自满，美帝国主义一天不放弃侵略野心，我们就一天也不放松抗美援朝工作，等六个月增产捐献计划完成后，我们还要想出其他办法来继续支援你们！”
