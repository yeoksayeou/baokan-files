    In the Future, the Regulation of Not Accepting Married Women Will Be Abolished
    The Unified Enrollment Committee of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau's Secondary Hygiene Technology School Has Made a Self-Criticism

Comrade Editor:

    After reading Comrade Huang Difei's article "The Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau's Secondary Hygiene Technology School Should Not Stipulate That Married Women Not Be Accepted During Unified Enrollment" in the People's Daily on July 25th, after our self-examination, we believe that our regulation of not accepting married women is indeed a manifestation of feudal ideas that discriminate against women.

    Our stipulation of not accepting "married women" in the enrollment brochure was only based on the one-sided, local perspective that pregnancy after marriage would affect academic studies, and we did not pay attention to the fact that women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life. The Personnel Department of the Central People's Government issued a notice at the end of May on abolishing the regulation of "not accepting pregnant women" when recruiting staff and trainees, but we did not pay attention to or study and implement this instruction. In retrospect, this was due to insufficient study of higher-level documents and the Common Program.

    Based on the opinions put forward by Comrade Huang Difei, we have decided to abolish the regulation of not accepting "married women" in future enrollment, and to conscientiously study the Common Program and eliminate feudal ideas that discriminate against women.

### 今后决废除不收已婚妇女规定  北京市公共卫生局中级卫生技术  学校统一招生委员会已作检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    今后决废除不收已婚妇女规定
    北京市公共卫生局中级卫生技术
    学校统一招生委员会已作检讨编辑同志：
    读人民日报七月二十五日黄涤非同志所写“北京市公共卫生局中级卫生技术学校统一招生时不应规定不收已婚妇女”一文后，经我们检讨，认为我们规定不收已婚妇女确是一种歧视妇女的封建思想的表现。
    我们在招生简章中规定不收“已婚女子”，只是从婚后妊娠影响学业，片面本位观点出发，而没有注意到妇女在政治、经济、文化教育、社会生活各方面均有与男子平等的权利。中央人民政府人事部在五月底已发出关于废除招考工作人员及学员时“不收孕妇”规定的通知，但对这一指示，我们并未加以重视及研究执行，检讨起来，是学习上级文件与共同纲领不够所致。
    根据黄涤非同志所提出的意见，我们已决定今后招生时决废除不收“已婚妇女”的规定，并认真学习共同纲领，肃清歧视妇女的封建思想。
