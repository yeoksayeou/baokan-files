    New People, New Deeds in New China
    Jiamusi City Wheel Saw Lumber Mill Comes Up With a Good Way to Save Timber
    Editor:
    In May and June of this year, Jiamusi City opened seven wheel saw lumber mills, using bark originally intended for fuel to saw into lath strips (used for ceilings) and box boards, saving a lot of timber. According to current statistics, the lumber mills can saw out 300 bundles of lath strips and about 10 meters of box boards every day, which can not only supply the needs of construction in the city, but also supply the needs of construction in other areas. Since the Northeast Daily published the State Council of the Central People's Government's instructions on saving timber on August 18, our city's Forestry Section, in the spirit of saving timber, has continued to vigorously promote this; as a result, the military dependents' firewood factory (firewood refers to wood for burning) run by the city's Civil Affairs Section has also decided to convert to a wheel saw lumber mill, using the boards formerly used for splitting firewood to saw into lath strips and box boards. This not only saves timber, but also increases profits for the factory, which is a triple win. This method can be used as a reference for other places.

    佳木斯市轮锯制材厂想出节约木材好办法编辑同志：
    佳木斯市于本年五六月间，开设了七家轮锯制材厂，利用作燃料的板皮，锯成灰条子（做天花板用的木条）及箱子板，节省了很多木材。据现在统计，每天制材厂能锯出灰条子三百捆，箱子板十公尺左右，不但可以供给本市建筑的需要，且可以供给外埠建筑之用。自八月十八日东北日报登载中央人民政府政务院关于节约木材的指示后，我市林业科本着节约木材之精神，继续大力宣传；结果，本市民政科所开办的军属柈子厂（柈子即烧火用的劈柴），也决定改办轮锯制材厂，利用过去劈柈子的板材，锯成灰条子及箱子板。这样既可节约木材，又可为工厂增高利润，真是一举数得。这种办法可供各地参考。
