    No Longer Doing "Dumb Bargains"
    Certain rural cooperative work cadres in Xinxiang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, have changed their past practice of doing "dumb bargains" and have become active elements in promoting patriotism. When they go to the countryside to sell and deliver goods, they not only conduct business but also discuss current events and news with the masses and explain the principles of the worker-peasant alliance, which is very popular among the peasants. The peasants say, "We bought cheap goods and learned about national affairs." Because the peasants welcome it, the sales volume of the cooperatives has increased significantly. In order to promote current affairs in their work, cooperative cadres have begun to pay attention to learning. Some cadres who previously believed that "working in a cooperative means you don't have to care about politics" have also subscribed to "Current Affairs Handbooks" and read the newspaper every day, the political atmosphere has become more intense, and work enthusiasm has increased; some cadres who were previously unwilling to work in cooperatives and thought that going to the countryside to sell goods was "shameful" now also feel that their work is glorious and very meaningful.
    Combining various businesses and regularly conducting patriotic propaganda and education among the masses is beneficial for educating the masses, educating oneself, and developing one's own business. Certain cooperative department cadres in Xinxiang Prefecture simultaneously conduct current affairs propaganda work when they go to the countryside. This approach is correct and worth promoting.

### 不再做“哑吧买卖”了

    不再做“哑吧买卖”了
    平原省新乡专区某些农村合作社的工作干部，改变了过去做“哑吧买卖”的方式，变成了宣传爱国主义的积极分子。他们下乡卖货送货时，一方面作生意，一方面向群众谈时事新闻，讲解工农联盟的道理，很受农民欢迎。农民说：“买了便宜货，又知道了国家大事。”因为农民欢迎，所以合作社的售货量显著增加了。合作社干部为了要在工作中宣传时事，开始注意学习。某些过去认为“到合作社工作可以不问政治”的干部，也订了“时事手册”，并且每天读报，政治空气浓厚起来，工作情绪提高了；某些过去不愿到合作社工作，认为下乡卖货“丢人”的干部，现在也觉得自己的工作很光荣，很有意思了。
    结合各种业务，经常地向群众进行爱国主义的宣传教育，对于教育群众，教育自己，开展自己的业务，都是有益的。新乡专区某些合作社部门干部在下乡时，同时作时事宣传工作。这种做法是正确的，值得推广。
