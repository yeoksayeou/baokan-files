Huge Changes in the Lives of Northeast Coal Miners in the Past Two Years
Wang Mingheng

Yang Chunhua, a Northeast miner, in his own poem, vividly described the contrast between the old and new lives of Northeast coal miners. The poem goes like this:

Under the puppet Manchurian regime, workers suffered,
Eaten alive by Japanese devils and foremen,
Waists wrapped in burlap sacks,
Broken shoes exposing toes,
Sleeping in sheds at night,
Eating acorn flour buns,
No hope when disaster struck or sickness came,
Thrown to the Western Hills after death,
× ×
The Communist Party brought us liberation,
Truly seeing the sun after the rain,
Acorn flour replaced with big steamed buns,
Living in bright white buildings,
Wearing a new set of clothes,
Carrying a golden pen in our pockets,
Eager to study, full of enthusiasm,
Picking up the pickaxe with vigor.

During the puppet Manchurian rule, the mines were full of electric fences and barbed wire, with "correctional institutions" and "guidance centers." Every mine had its "ten thousand people pit," a grim reality. Mine workers were transformed into forced laborers, toiling under the double whip of enemy and puppet capitalists and foremen in a state of despair. After the people's government took over the mines, the situation of the coal miners changed fundamentally. They used their active labor to restore and develop coal mine production.

Creative Labor Changes the Face of the Mines

Due to the miners' active labor and development of production, the ugly face of the mines in the past has been transformed. Looking at the output of Northeast coal mines, if 1948 is 100, then 1949 is 201, 1950 is 244, and the first half of 1951 is 102.6% of the same period in 1950. Looking at the ash content of coal, if 1949 is 100, then 1950 is 89.62, and the first half of 1951 is 89.3. Looking at efficiency, if 1949 is 100, then 1950 is 130, and the first half of 1951 also saw an appropriate increase. The above figures show that the production of Northeast miners is increasing year by year.

I remember in the autumn of 1946 and for a period afterward, when the motherland was in difficulty, trains burned soybean cakes and wood, and coal was precious.苗子文 Miao Ziwen, a miner from Jixi, stood in icy water, soaked to the bone for three days and nights to repair the Zhongnuan No. 6 pit. 隋永茂 Sui Yongmao, an outstanding advanced producer from Hegang, repeatedly fell into the fire to rescue the pithead. Most unforgettable was the gas explosion in Didao Mine last year, where five people, including Hui Pengfei, chairman of the trade union, and Wang Xian, assistant engineer, sacrificed themselves to rescue their fellow workers in the pithead and working face. The day before Hui Pengfei's sacrifice, he was still lingering in front of the attendance board of the No. 4 pit, studying how to help treat two sick workers. In this kind of self-sacrificing labor attitude, the love of the Northeast miners for the motherland and their own class is strongly expressed.

Labor can only shine with creativity when it is understood to be for one's own happiness and the needs of the motherland. I remember around the spring of 1950, when the Northeast Industrial New Record Movement was on the rise, new records in coal mining and tunneling were constantly emerging, and hundreds of tools and various labor organizations were being improved, the news of old miner Li Leting's success in operating a mechanized large working face began to spread throughout the mines. 曲福明 Qu Fuming, a miner from Benxi, created twelve consecutive new records of overfulfilling national tasks. Especially under the suggestion of old mechanical worker Liu Xianting, all the dilapidated coal washing plants in Fuxin were miraculously repaired one by one, unleashing the huge potential of the Northeast coal mining industry.

The active labor of the new masters has transformed the face of the old coal mountains.

Due to the active labor of Northeast coal miners and the development of production, the direct income (wages) of workers has also been continuously increasing. Taking the average wage in 1948 as 100, then 1949 was 126.4, 1950 was 151.8, and 1951 was 169.8. Indirect income (including all welfare facilities, cultural and educational funds, etc.) is also gradually increasing.

Responsibility Accidents Can Be Eliminated

Moving from unsafe to safe is one of the most important changes in the lives of Northeast coal miners in the past two years. According to the injury and death statistics of the mines under the Northeast Coal Mining Administration, 1950 decreased by 28.73% compared to 1949; the first half of 1951 decreased by 45.34% compared to the same period in 1950, and individual mining areas (such as Tonghua) have had no deaths throughout the year. Injury accidents have also been greatly reduced. People's views on the mines are no longer so terrible and disgusting. Old Lady Yin of Fuguo Mine said: "Ever since my man died in the pit, my heart followed my child into the pit every time he went down. Sometimes when he came home late, I was always worried that something had happened, and I rushed to the pithead to see. Now I can rest assured. Sometimes my child doesn't come back for half the night, and I no longer think that there has been an accident. I'm sure he's either studying or in a meeting." How has people's attitude towards mine life changed from pessimistic to positive due to the victory of safe production! The improvement of safe production was achieved under the extraordinary concern and leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and through the great efforts of all employees. In a sense, safe production is an important indicator of coal mine production improvement at this stage. Because to achieve safe production, it is necessary to change the backward and dangerous production methods of the past. The implementation of scientific new-style coal mining methods and the reduction of accidents, in turn, cannot but increase productivity and reduce costs. In addition, in order to achieve safe production, it is also necessary to improve the technology of the vast number of miners, establish strict labor discipline, and especially break the deep-rooted pessimistic and fatalistic views, and replace them with scientific safe production views. Even for a long period after liberation, workers still widely spread words like, "Four stones夹块肉, the one who mines big coal is buried but not dead." The Northeast Coal Miners' Union has done relatively detailed and in-depth work in this regard, which now boils down to one point: extensively launch the Shi Yuhai movement. That is to say, organize and educate the vast number of miners to actively learn from Shi Yuhai's safe production experience; strictly abide by security regulations and various systems; improve project quality; and strengthen political and cultural learning. The fact that miner Shi Yuhai has not had an accident in a coal mining face with difficult conditions (15-30 cubic meters of gas gushing out per ton of coal, and a very bad roof) for four years has proved to all miners that the dangerous factors of underground operations are only the possibility of accidents, not the inevitability of causing accidents, and that science and human power can completely prevent accidents from happening. The promotion of the Shi Yuhai movement has greatly helped to establish scientific safe production views, improve production technology, and significantly reduce accident injuries and deaths. In the Northeast coal mines, 1,980 production groups with more than 45,000 people are involved in this movement, and the scale of the movement is quite magnificent.

Happy Life

When people walk into the Northeast mines, they can see rows of newly built or renovated workers' dormitories, with red tiles and white ash walls shining in the distance. The miners' shanty life is just something left in painful memories. According to statistics from the Northeast Coal Mining Administration, the repair and construction of houses in the past two years has reached more than 272,000 square meters. The state's investment in this area to improve the lives of miners is quite large! Regarding housing construction and welfare facilities, here we must present another incomplete but extremely important statistic: Northeast coal mines now have 58 hospitals, clinics, sanatoriums, rest homes, veterans' homes, and nursing homes; 249 children's schools, spare-time schools, and pithead schools; 247 canteens and bathhouses; and 98 cinemas, theaters, and clubs. This cannot be considered a small number. It is from here that we can see more comprehensively the rich life content of the miners. The new and beautiful life itself makes the workers deeply understand the great significance of "People's Mines," constantly inspiring their love for the motherland, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao, and their desire for the advancement of work and production. Recently, 58 Northeast mine cadres and model workers signed a letter to the Northeast Coal Miners' Union, which read: "...The environment here is very good, with lush trees, flowers, fishponds, and fresh air. The院长院长 told us that during the puppet Manchurian era, this was the Japanese devils' army sanatorium, heavily guarded, and Chinese people were not allowed to rest here, let alone look outside. But today it has become our coal miners' sanatorium, and we can come here to rest quietly. We deeply realize that without the great leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the sacrifices and struggles of countless revolutionary comrades, we coal miners would never be able to enjoy this honor and happiness. ...Since coming to the sanatorium, our weight has increased, some by twelve pounds, and our spirits are very full. Everyone unanimously expressed that after returning, we will work harder, increase production, donate airplanes and cannons, deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, protect our motherland, and resolutely defeat the aggression of American imperialism!" Many miners always shed tears in private when they first entered the spare-time sanatorium, never thinking that such a happy life had come to the Northeast miners.

Now, the mines are full of songs, laughter, but the loudest of them is the sound of reading. Look: in the pit, there are study groups for coal mining, transportation, etc., with words written on the front of the car and the person pushing the car behind reading aloud. At the pithead, there are pithead schools, studying in three shifts day and night; in the workers' large houses, there are炕头 groups, with the little teachers tirelessly teaching words. In the family dormitories, there are also family groups. 李海 Li Hai, a miner from Jixi, is an old illiterate in his forties. From learning to read last winter, he can now read newspapers, write letters, and write reports; the administration knew that he had become cultured, so they promoted him from coal miner to gunpowder depot manager. His family group is famous. His wife, 谷文琴 Gu Wenqin, also learned more than 500 characters in a year, and his little girl has become a model little teacher. His family taught four groups, educating 42 illiterates. Learning (in addition to literacy education, there is also political, technical, and other education) has imperceptibly become a wave of joy in the mines. After work every time, you can always see dozens or hundreds of young miners, wearing new clothes and carrying calico schoolbags, rushing to school, as if they are compensating for the joy of going to school that they once lost as children. Life is changing like this. According to statistics in July 1950, the number of illiterates in the mines began to drop from more than 80% to 71%. According to statistics in March this year, it has further dropped to 61.5%. At present, 20,000 illiterate miners have obtained the qualifications for primary school graduation and are moving towards higher political and technical learning.

    两年来东北煤矿工人生活的巨大变化
    王名衡
    东北矿工杨春华在他自己写的诗中，朴素地但又形象地描述了东北煤矿工人新旧生活的对比。这首诗是这样说的：
    伪满工人受苦头，吃人的鬼子和把头，
    腰里围着麻袋头，破鞋露着脚趾头，
    夜间睡觉棚里头，吃些橡面窝窝头，
    生灾长病没盼头，死后扔到西山头，
    ×    ×
    共产党来出了头，真是晴天见日头，
    橡面换成大馒头，住在雪白楼里头，
    置了一套新行头，怀里带着金笔头，
    努力学习有兴头，拿起镐来有劲头。
    在伪满统治时期，矿山满布电网铁丝网，那里设立矫正院和辅导院，那个矿山都有名符其实的“万人坑”。矿山工人变成了囚犯劳动者，在敌伪资本家和把头的双重皮鞭下，进行着绝望的劳动。人民政权接管矿山后，煤矿工人的情况发生了根本的变化。他们用自己积极的劳动，恢复并发展了煤矿的生产。
    创造性的劳动改变了矿山面貌
    由于煤矿工人积极地劳动，发展了生产，因而变换了矿山过去丑陋的面貌。东北煤矿生产，从产量上看，一九四八年为一百，则一九四九年为二百零一，一九五○年为二百四十四，而一九五一年上半年度又为一九五○年同期百分之一○二点六。从煤的灰分上看，一九四九年为一百，一九五○年为八十九点六二，一九五一年上半年度为八十九点三。从效率上看，一九四九年为一百，一九五○年为
    一百三十，一九五一年上半年度也有适当的提高。上述数字说明了东北矿工的生产是逐年提高的。
    记得一九四六年秋季及以后一个时期，当祖国处在困难的时候，火车烧着豆饼和木材，煤是宝贵的。鸡西矿工苗子文为了修复中暖六坑，三天三晚全身透湿地站在冰冷的水掌子里劳动着。鹤岗出色的先进生产者隋永茂，为了救护坑口，一再跌扑在火里。最令人不能忘记的是去年滴道矿瓦斯爆发，为了抢救坑口和掌子里的工友，工会主席翬鹏飞、助理工程师王显等五人牺牲了。而翬鹏飞牺牲前一天，还徘徊在四坑出勤板前，研究如何帮助诊治两个生病的工友。在这样一种自我牺牲的劳动态度里，强烈地表现着东北矿工对于祖国对于自己阶级的热爱。
    劳动，只有被理解到是为着自己的幸福和祖国的需要的时候，才能发着创造性的光辉。记得一九五○年春季前后，当东北工业新纪录运动走向高涨，采煤、掘进的新纪录不断涌现，千百件工具和各种劳动组织得着改进的时候，各矿山开始风传着老矿工李乐亭经营机械化大掌子成功的喜讯；本溪矿工曲福明连创十二次超额完成国家任务的新纪录。特别是在老机械工人刘献廷建议下，阜新所有破烂的选煤厂奇迹似地一一修复起来了，为东北煤矿工业发挥了巨大潜力。
    新主人翁的积极劳动改造了旧煤山的面貌。
    由于东北煤矿工人积极地劳动发展了生产，工人的直接所得（工资）亦不断上升。以一九四八年平均工资为一百，一九四九年则为一百二十六点四，一九五○年为一百五十一点八，一九五一年为一百六十九点八。而间接所得（包括所有福利设施，文化教育经费等）也正在逐步提高着。
    责任事故是可以消灭的
    从不安全走向安全，这是东北煤矿工人生活两年来最重要的变化之一。据东北煤矿管理局所属矿区的伤亡统计，一九五○年比一九四九年减少百分之二十八点七三；一九五一年上半年度比一九五○年同期又减少百分之四十五点三四，个别矿区（如通化）已全年无死亡事故。伤亡事故也大大减少。人们对矿山的看法再也不是那么可怕和厌恶的了。富国矿尹老大娘说：“自我男人死在坑内以后，早先我孩子每次下坑，我的心也跟着他下坑。有时他晚回家来，我总是提心吊胆的，以为出了什么事故，急急忙忙跑到坑口去探望。现在我可放心了。有时孩子半宿不回来，我再也不会想到是出了事故。我准知道他不是在学习，就是在开会哩。”由于安全生产的胜利，人们对于矿山生活的情绪是如何由悲观的走向积极的啊！安全生产的改善是在党和人民政府异常关切和领导之下，经过全体职工的巨大努力才取得的。在某种意义上说，安全生产是现阶段煤矿生产提高的一个重要指标。因为要达到生产安全，就必须改变过去落后而又危险的生产方法。而科学的新式采煤方法的实施和事故的减少，反过来又不能不提高生产率，降低成本。此外，为了要达到安全生产，还必须改善广大矿工的技术，树立严格的劳动纪律，特别是破除根深蒂固的悲观的宿命观点，代之以科学的安全生产观点。即使在解放后一个较长时期内，工人还普遍地传着，“四块石头夹块肉，刨大煤的是埋了没死的人”一类的话。东北煤矿工会在这方面作了比较细致和深入的工作，现在则归结到一点：广泛展开施玉海运动。这就是说，组织和教育广大的矿工积极学习施玉海安全生产经验；严格遵守保安规程和各种制度；提高工程质量；加强政治文化学习。矿工施玉海在条件困难的采煤掌子内（每吨煤冒出瓦斯一五——三○立方公尺，顶板很坏）四年未出事故这一事实，向所有矿工证明了，地下作业的危险因素只不过是发生事故的可能性，绝不是造成事故的必然性，而科学和人的力量则是完全可以阻止事故的发生的。施玉海运动的推行，大大有助于科学的安全生产观点的树立，生产技术的提高，事故伤亡的显著降低。东北各煤矿卷入这一运动的有一千九百八十个生产小组，达四万五千余人，运动的规模是颇为壮阔的。幸福的生活
    人们一走进东北的矿山，便可以看到一列列的新盖或重修的工人宿舍，红瓦白灰墙远远地发着闪光。矿工的草棚生活只是留在痛苦的记忆中的事了。据东北煤矿管理局的统计，近两年来房舍的修补建设已达二十七万二千余平方公尺。国家为着改善矿工的生活，在这方面的投资数额是相当巨大的！关于房屋修建福利设施，这里必须提出另一个不完全的但极关重要的统计：东北煤矿现有医院、医务所、疗养院、休养所、残废院、养老院五十八处；子弟学校、业余学校、坑口学校二百四十九处；食堂、澡堂二百四十七处；电影院、剧院、俱乐部九十八处。这不能算是一个小的数字。正是从这里，我们可以比较全面地看到矿工丰富的生活内容。新的美好的生活本身使工人深深理解到“人民矿山”的重大意义，经常鼓舞起他们对于祖国对于共产党毛主席的热爱，渴望着工作和生产的向前发展。最近曾有五十八个东北矿工干部和劳动模范署名，写给东北煤矿工会一封信，上面写道：“……这里环境很好，树木繁茂，还有花草和鱼池，空气新鲜。院长告诉我们，伪满时代这里是日本鬼子的陆军休养院，戒备森严，中国人别说来休养，就是到外面看看也是犯法的。而今天却做了我们煤矿工人的疗养院，我们能到这里来安静地休养。我们深深体会到，这种荣誉和幸福，若没有共产党和毛主席的伟大领导和无数革命同志的牺牲奋斗，我们煤矿工人是永远享受不到的。……自来休养后，体重都增加了，有的增加了十二斤，精神都很饱满。大家一致表示，回去后要更努力工作，增加生产，捐献飞机大炮，深入抗美援朝运动，保护我们的祖国，坚决打败美帝国主义的侵略！”多少矿工初次进入业余休养所时，总是感动得私自掉泪，从未想到过的幸福生活，已经临到东北矿工的身上了。
    现在，矿山到处欢腾着歌唱声，笑乐声，但其中最响亮的却是读书声。试看：在坑内，有坑内采煤、运搬等学习小组，前面车皮上划着字，后面推车人在朗读着。在坑口，有坑口学校，每昼夜分三班学习；在工人大房子内，有炕头小组，小先生不疲倦地教字。在家属宿舍内，还有家庭小组。鸡西矿工李海，是一个四十多岁的老文盲。从前年冬识字起，到能看报、写信、写报告；行政方面知道他有了文化，由采煤工人提升他为火药库管理员。他的家庭小组是有名的。他的爱人谷文琴在一年之中也识了五百多字，他的小女孩已成为模范小先生。他的一家教了四个小组，教育着四十二个文盲。学习（除识字教育外还有政治、技术等等教育）在矿山已无形中成为一种欢乐的浪潮。每次下班后，总可看见成十成百的青年矿工们，穿着新衣服，夹着花布书包奔向学校，他们好像重行补偿着那曾经失去的儿童上学的愉快似的。生活就是这样变化着。据一九五○年七月统计，矿山文盲由百分之八十以上开始降至百分之七十一。今年三月统计，更降至百分之六十一点五。目前已有两万矿工文盲取得了初小毕业的资格，面向更高的政治、技术学习前进。
