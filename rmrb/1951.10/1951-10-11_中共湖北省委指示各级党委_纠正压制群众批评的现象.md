    After the *Changjiang Daily* published reports about Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau Deputy Director Song Ying and others suppressing criticism, along with relevant documents, the CCP Hubei Provincial Committee issued instructions on September 30th to all levels of Party organizations and all Party members in the province to conscientiously study the documents related to this issue, and to examine and correct the phenomena of suppressing democracy and violating discipline within some Party organizations and among some Party members. The instructions first pointed out: Party organizations at all levels in Hubei Province and all Party members should conscientiously study the report in the *People's Daily*’s "Party Life" column on September 11th, reprinted in the *Changjiang Daily* on September 27th, regarding Song Ying and others suppressing mass criticism, as well as the *People's Daily*’s "Brief Commentary on Party Life," the Central South Bureau’s instructions to the Wuhan Municipal Committee on handling this matter, the Wuhan Municipal Committee’s handling measures for Song Ying and others’ serious suppression of mass criticism, and the Municipal Committee’s self-criticism report, and the *Changjiang Daily*’s editorial on this issue. The instructions stated: Erroneous behaviors similar to Song Ying and Zhou Jifang’s suppression of mass criticism have also occurred continuously in various parts of Hubei Province. For example, the Party organization in Wulijie District, Wuchang, ignored criticisms in the newspapers, and failed to handle, explain, or respond to them for a long time. Chang Ganchen and others in Mianyang even held hostile attitudes towards those who made criticisms, and cursed and attacked them. Although these errors differ in degree from Song Ying and others' suppression of criticism, they all violate the Party's democratic principles and the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, and they have an impact on the Party's work, the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the Party's prestige among the masses. The instructions concluded: Throughout the province, it is essential to wage a struggle against this bad style of suppressing democracy and criticism, so as to promote the enthusiasm of the broad masses to supervise our work and cadres. The discipline inspection committees of the local prefectural committees and municipal committees should conscientiously guide the branches to study the relevant documents, examine and expose errors in this regard within the Party organizations and among some Party members in their respective regions, such as a lack of democratic style, a lack of the spirit of self-criticism, etc. Those with serious errors should be dealt with appropriately immediately, so as to thoroughly correct this kind of bad style.

    中共湖北省委指示各级党委  纠正压制群众批评的现象
    武汉市卫生局副局长宋瑛等压制批评的报道及有关文件在长江日报发表后，中共湖北省委于九月三十日指示该省各级党的组织及全体党员认真学习有关这一问题的文件，检查与纠正某些党组织内、某些党员中压制民主违犯纪律的现象。指示中首先指出：湖北省各级党组织和全体党员，应当认真学习九月二十七日长江日报转载的九月十一日人民日报《党的生活》栏关于宋瑛等压制群众批评的报告和人民日报《党的生活简评》、中南局关于处理此事给武汉市委的指示、武汉市委关于宋瑛等严重压制群众批评的处理办法及市委的检讨报告、长江日报有关这一问题的社论。指示写道：类似宋瑛、周季方等压制群众批评的错误行为，在湖北省各地也不断发生。例如武昌五里界区的党组织就对报纸上的批评置之不理，长期不作处理，也不作解释和答复。沔阳昌干臣等竟对批评者抱仇视态度，谩骂和打击批评者。这些错误虽然与宋瑛等压制批评有程度上的不同，但都是违背党的民主原则和中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定的精神的，对党的工作、党与群众的关系以及党在群众中的威信都是有影响的。指示最后指出：在全省范围内，向这种压制民主、压制批评的恶劣作风进行斗争，以发扬广大群众的积极性来监督我们的工作和干部，是十分必要的。各地委、市委纪律检查委员会，要认真地领导各支部学习有关文件，检查和揭发本地区党的组织和某些党员中在这方面的错误，例如缺乏民主作风，缺乏自我批评精神等等。对错误严重的，立即予以适当处理，务使这类恶劣作风得到彻底的纠正。
