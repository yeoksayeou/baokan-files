    To Promote Standard Operating Procedures, We Must First Dispel the Masses' Ideological Concerns

    Dispelling the ideological concerns of the worker masses and breaking down their conservative experience are prerequisites for implementing new standard operating procedures. The experience of the Zhonghua Match Factory in Tianjin fully illustrates this point. Since the factory began promoting standard operating procedures in July, waste products have been greatly reduced, product quantity has increased, and quality has improved. The efficiency of splint arranging has increased by 11.6%; the waste splint rate has decreased by 76%; and the safety of the machinery has been guaranteed.

    The main experience of this factory in promoting standard operating procedures is to do a good job of ideological education. When the groups first began discussing standard operating procedures, the ideological situation of the worker masses was quite chaotic. Some workers were willing to implement standard operating procedures; others were unwilling. They believed that changing the operating procedures would affect output, and some even said, "I've been doing this for thirty years, and now I have to learn?" In response to the different ideological situations of the masses, the factory's trade union conducted explanatory education in the groups, explaining the benefits of implementing standard operating procedures for national economic construction and for improving workers' skills; pointing out that increasing production is a concrete manifestation of patriotism. At the same time, the trade union organized comparison demonstrations of the old and standard operating procedures, using vivid facts to allow workers to personally experience the significant differences in the quantity and quality of products produced when doing the same type of work with different methods. After the workers' ideological concerns were dispelled, their enthusiasm for learning immediately increased.

    This fact shows that for any work to be carried out, it is necessary to conduct thorough ideological education among the masses beforehand, so that the masses act consciously and willingly, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve results; because breaking down the traditional conservative experience of the masses requires great effort.

### 推广标准操作法必须首先解除群众思想顾虑

    推广标准操作法
    必须首先解除群众思想顾虑
    解除工人群众的思想顾虑，打破工人群众的保守经验，是推行新的标准操作法的前提。天津市中华火柴厂的事实，充分地说明了这个经验。该厂自七月份推广标准操作法以来，废品大为减少，产品数量增加，质量提高。排梗提高效率百分之十一点六；废梗率降低百分之七十六；而且保证了机器的安全。
    该厂推行标准操作法的主要经验，是做好思想教育工作。当各小组开始讨论标准操作法时，工人群众的思想情况是相当混乱的。有些工人愿意实行标准操作法；有些工人则不愿意实行。他们认为改变操作法会影响产量，有的人甚至说：“我干了三十多年，还要学习？”该厂工会针对群众不同的思想情况，在小组里进行解释教育：说明实行标准操作法对国家经济建设的好处，对提高工人技术的好处；指出增加生产就是爱国主义的具体表现。同时，工会组织了旧操作法与标准操作法的对比表演，以生动的事实，让工人亲自体会到作同一种工作，由于作法不同，所生产的产品数量和质量就有很大的差别。工人们的思想顾虑解除后，学习的积极性马上提高了。
    这个事实说明：进行任何工作，事前必须对群众进行充分的思想教育，让群众自觉自愿地行动起来，否则就很难获得成绩；因为打破群众传统的保守经验，是需要经过很大努力的。
