Why is it necessary for Zhengzhou Railway Administration to make up for this lesson of democratic reform?

The workers of Zhengzhou Railway Administration have a glorious tradition of the "February 7th" revolutionary struggle. During the period of Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek bandits' rule, they also carried out many heroic struggles; when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled, many workers participated in the struggle to protect the factory. In the early days of liberation, the enthusiasm of the employees was very high, and they completed the arduous tasks of emergency repairs and military transportation, successfully supporting the liberation of the Central South and Southwest regions by the army; then they completed the massive construction tasks, and production efficiency gradually increased. However, due to the long-term rule of the reactionaries, the feudal reactionary forces were very strong. For example, in a certain factory, there were as many as twenty-seven kinds of reactionary feudal organizations. Before liberation, they oppressed the workers for a long time. After liberation, although some of the chief culprits had fled or been arrested, because we had not yet had time to resolutely and thoroughly implement democratic reforms and had not fully mobilized the masses, these bad elements continued to carry out sabotage activities and attack activists. Some even mixed into the organizations of the Party and the Youth League; some stole the leadership positions of grassroots trade unions, some fraudulently claimed credit and became model workers, and some were promoted to cadres; some still occupied their original leadership positions and continued to rule and oppress the workers. Therefore, the workers said: "The top is liberated, but the bottom is not." The enthusiasm of the workers, which was once high after liberation, cooled down again. When the US imperialist invading army landed in Inchon, the bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, and the thinking of employees in some units became chaotic. After patriotic education against US aggression and aid to Korea, the morale of the employees gradually stabilized, and their political awareness also improved, but the serious internal political problems were still not resolved. This situation was fully exposed during the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, a batch of counter-revolutionary elements was eliminated, and although some feudal reactionary elements were also involved, it was not possible to fundamentally eliminate them; therefore, the employees not only demanded the elimination of counter-revolutionary elements, but also urgently demanded the elimination of feudal reactionary elements who directly oppressed them. According to this situation, in order to thoroughly transform the old bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into people's enterprises worthy of the name, it is necessary to resolutely rely on the masses and thoroughly implement democratic reform.

A New Atmosphere in Democratic Reform

Since the Central South Urban Work Conference and the Ministry of Railways Political Work Conference this year, the guiding principles of the democratic reform movement have become clearer. We immediately made up our minds to concentrate all our efforts on carrying out this movement. In addition to assigning special personnel in charge of business in administrative units at all levels, all Party, administrative, trade union, and Youth League cadres formed work teams and went to various places to train Party members, League members, and activists who had emerged in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, so that they could become the backbone of the movement and organize them to publicize policies among the masses. Because this movement is in line with the demands of the broad masses, it can be quickly launched.

In the past two months or so, the masses have risen up and overthrown the feudal reactionary forces, and are now carrying out democratic unity to solve the internal problems of the working class. After the struggle against feudal remnants, a new atmosphere has emerged in the Zhengzhou Railway Administration. First of all, it boosted the morale of the workers, raised the consciousness of the working class, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and strengthened the internal unity of the working class. The workers said: "When the counter-revolutionaries were suppressed, half the sky cleared up, but this time it's all clear." Some said: "The emancipation was not thorough in the past, but this time it's truly turned over." Therefore, the workers set off firecrackers and danced the yangko to celebrate their liberation. Xiang Ming, a worker at the Hankou Railway Sub-bureau, lost too much blood due to a work injury, and more than twenty people immediately asked to give him a blood transfusion.

Secondly, it inspired the workers' enthusiasm for production, and the workers were engaged in production with the attitude of masters, so the production efficiency was greatly improved. People felt that the Zhengzhou Railway Administration was very different before and after the democratic reform: in the past, the foreman urged the workers, but now the workers urged the foreman; in the past, they disliked the "watch being slow," but now they disliked the "watch being fast"; in the past, the locomotive waited for the people, but now the people waited for the locomotive; in the past, they complained that there were few people and a lot of work, but now they complained that there were many people and little work. The workers of the Jiang'an Railway Machinery Factory automatically demanded to increase the task, and "loafing on the job" has become a historical term.

Due to the increase in the enthusiasm of employees for production, production efficiency has also been greatly improved. In the past, it took 1,769 man-days to overhaul a locomotive at the Jiang'an Railway Machinery Factory. In the democratic reform, it was reduced to 1,207 man-days in June and 972 man-days in July, and the quality has reached 80%; it can be delivered after one test run (the Ministry stipulates that it can be delivered after two test runs). In the past, it took more than 30 days to inspect a locomotive at the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot, but now it takes an average of 7 to 9 days, and some only take four and a half days. The turnaround time of locomotives at the Chang'an Locomotive Depot has been shortened from 0.7 days to 0.63 days; in the past, six locomotives were used a day, but now only four are used.

During the democratic reform movement, a large number of activists emerged, and a large number of worker cadres were promoted from them. As of early September, the bureau had promoted 2,759 cadres above the level of foreman. According to statistics from the three regions of Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Xinxiang, activists accounted for 37.1% of the total number of people. In the past, some leading cadres believed that workers had low cultural levels and could not do things; in this movement, they learned that the workers had talent and experience, and that as long as they were trained and exercised for a certain period of time, they could become cadres.

In this movement, the prestige of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League among the masses has also been unprecedentedly improved. Employees and their families warmly thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The workers can raise any opinions they have. When leading cadres go to the site, the workers surround them in a large circle, asking this and that. The relationship between the Party and the masses is also closer.

Improve the Class Consciousness of the Broad Masses of Workers

Facts have proved that it is very correct to fully mobilize the workers to carry out democratic reform, and it is an essential stage for reforming old enterprises and relying on workers to develop production. Correctly carrying out democratic reforms will not only not affect production, but also greatly improve production efficiency due to the elimination of feudal reactionary forces and the liberation of productive forces. In the past, some people mistakenly believed that feudal reactionary forces could also be educated and reformed in a peaceful "gentle breeze and drizzle" manner. They doubted whether the implementation of democratic reforms "would disrupt the enterprise" and "whether it would affect production." Facts have proved that these views are incorrect. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and carry out resolute struggles to thoroughly defeat the feudal reactionary forces. Although the democratic reform movement requires the use of some work hours, if the work is arranged properly and special personnel are in charge of the business, the production tasks can be completed due to the increase in the workers' awareness. For example, the Jiang'an Railway Machinery Factory only completed 85.7% of the locomotive task in May. During the democratic reform movement, it completed 112.5% in both June and July; the passenger car task completed 150% in May, while it completed 304% in June, and the quality was also improved. The workers were engaged in democratic reform during the day, spending a little work time, and they automatically made up for it at night. The trade union cadres could not persuade them to leave when they went to the workshop. Democratic reform is not only a reform of personnel and systems, but also a transformation of the thinking of employees. Therefore, after defeating the feudal reactionary elements, we should guide the workers to understand the reasons for past oppression from a class perspective, and organize the workers to discuss: Why did the feudal reactionary elements dare to run rampant in the past, who supported them; why were the workers oppressed, unable to eat enough, and unable to keep warm in the past; why can the workers take revenge and turn over to be masters today; so that the workers can recognize the loveliness of today's New China by hating the past, and recognize that we must consolidate our country in order to create an infinitely beautiful future and no longer be bullied and oppressed by imperialism and its running dogs; we must love our motherland, our political party, our government, and trade union organizations; we must reform the production management system, launch production competitions, improve production efficiency, and implement an economic accounting system in order to enhance the country's economic and defense strength.

Don't be arrogant or slack, deeply launch the democratic reform movement!

Generally speaking, in this stage of the democratic reform movement, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has basically defeated the enemy, established the prestige and integrity of the workers, the masses' awareness has been improved, and a new atmosphere has emerged, and considerable achievements have been made. However, it is still necessary to implement democratic unity and continue to deeply launch this movement. Recently, some units have developed a sense of pride and complacency after the first stage of democratic reform, namely the democratic struggle stage. Some believe that the democratic reform has ended, and individual leading cadres are afraid that the masses will raise opinions, and some masses are also thinking: "Is there a second democratic reform?" They do not yet understand that democratic reform is a complete mass movement. This movement not only wants to defeat the feudal reactionary forces, but also wants to establish new thinking styles, establish new systems and new personnel relationships, in order to achieve internal unity of the working class and create convenient conditions for developing production. Democratic unity is to further solve the internal problems of the working class on the basis of the victory of the democratic struggle. It is a serious ideological struggle within the working class, which will solve the problems of old systems, old styles, and gang cliques. The central issue in doing a good job in democratic unity is "releasing democracy and centralizing leadership." The first step must be to mobilize the masses, eliminate concerns, and enable the masses to "say whatever they have to say," and then guide the masses to check production work. The second step must be to summarize the opinions of the masses and then hand them over to the masses for discussion. The third step is to solve the problems that the masses have raised that can be solved immediately, such as ideological styles, by means of criticism and self-criticism. For problems such as production systems, they can be left to the next step to solve, in order to further improve production.

    坚决实行民主改革，办好人民铁路！
    ——郑州铁路管理局实行民主改革的初步经验
    郑州铁路管理局局长  刘建章
    为什么郑州铁路管理局必须补上民主改革这一课？
    郑州铁路管理局工人是有“二七”革命斗争的光荣传统的。在日伪蒋匪统治时期，他们也曾进行过多次英勇的斗争；蒋匪溃逃时，很多工人参加了护厂斗争。解放初期，职工群众生产情绪很高，完成了艰巨的抢修与军运任务，胜利地支援大军解放中南、西南地区；接着又完成了浩大的工程修建任务，生产效率日渐提高。但由于反动派长期统治，封建反动势力是很大的。如某工厂反动封建组织就有二十七种之多。解放以前，他们长期地压迫工人。解放以后，一部分首恶分子虽已逃匿或被逮捕，但因为我们还没有来得及坚决彻底地实行民主改革，没有把群众充分发动起来，因此这些坏分子仍然继续进行破坏活动，打击积极分子。有的甚至混入党和青年团的组织；有的窃取了基层工会的领导地位，有的窃功当了劳动模范，有的被提拔为干部；有的仍占着原来的领导地位，继续统治和欺压工人群众。所以，工人群众说：“上面解放，下面没解放。”解放后工人群众一度高涨的热情又冷了下去。当美帝国主义侵略军在仁川登陆时，坏分子乘机造谣，某些单位的职工思想发生混乱。经过抗美援朝爱国主义教育以后，员工情绪逐渐稳定，政治觉悟也有提高，但内部严重的政治问题仍未解决。在大张旗鼓镇压反革命的时候，这种情况才完全暴露出来。经过镇压反革命，清除了一批反革命分子，虽也涉及一些封建反动分子，但并未能从根本上肃清；因之职工群众不仅要求清除反革命分子，而且迫切要求肃清直接欺压他们的封建反动分子。根据这种情况，要彻底改造旧的官僚资本主义企业成为名符其实的人民企业，就必须坚决依靠群众，彻底实行民主改革。
    在民主改革中呈现一片新气象
    自今年中南城市工作会议及铁道部政治工作会议以后，民主改革运动的方针更为明确。我们当即下定决心，集中全力开展这一运动。除各级行政单位指定专人负责掌握业务外，全部党、行政、工会、青年团的干部组成工作队，分赴各地训练党员、团员及在镇压反革命运动中涌现出来的积极分子，使他们成为运动中的骨干，组织他们在群众中宣传政策。因为这一运动合乎广大群众的要求，所以能迅速展开。
    两个多月来，群众起来了，打倒了封建反动势力，现正进行民主团结，解决工人阶级内部问题。经过了反封建残余的斗争，郑州铁路局出现了一片新气象。首先，鼓舞了工人情绪，提高了工人阶级觉悟，分清了敌我，加强了工人阶级内部的团结。工人说：“镇压反革命时，晴了半个天，这次全晴了。”有的说：“过去翻身不彻底，这回才算真正翻了身。”因此工人放鞭炮，扭秧歌，庆贺自己翻身。汉口铁路分局工友向明还因工伤流血过多，立刻就有二十多人要求给他输血。
    其次，启发了工人的生产热情，工人们都以主人翁的姿态从事生产，因而生产效率大大提高。人们都感到，郑州铁路局在民主改革前后大不相同了：过去工长催工人，现在工人催工长；过去嫌“表慢”，现在嫌“表快”；过去机车等人，现在人等机车；过去嫌人少活多，现在嫌人多活少。江岸铁路机厂工人自动要求增加任务，“磨洋工”已成为历史名词了。
    由于职工生产积极性的提高，生产效率也大大提高了。江岸铁路机厂过去中修一台机车需要一千七百六十九个工，在民主改革中，六月份减到一千二百零七个工，七月份又减到九百七十二个工，质量已达百分之八十；只要试运转一次就能交工（部定试运转两次交工）。郑州机务段过去甲检一台机车需要三十天以上，现在平均七天到九天就行了，有的只要四天半。长安机务段机车周转时间从○·七天缩短到○·六三天；过去一天用六台机车，现在用四台就行。
    在民主改革运动中，又涌现了大批积极分子，从中提拔了大批工人干部。截至九月上旬，全局提拔了工长以上干部二千七百五十九人。郑州、洛阳、新乡三个地区统计，积极分子占总人数百分之三十七点一。过去某些领导干部认为工人文化低，干不了事；在这次运动中了解到工人群众是有才能和经验的，只要经过一定时期的培养与锻炼，他们是可以成为干部的。
    在此次运动中，党、行政、工会和青年团在群众中的威信也空前提高了。职工及其家属热情地感谢毛主席、感谢共产党。工人有啥意见都能提出来了。领导干部下现场，工人一围一大圈，问这问那。党与群众的关系也更密切了。
    提高广大工人群众的阶级觉悟
    事实证明，充分发动工人群众进行民主改革是十分正确的，是改革旧企业、依靠工人发展生产的必经阶段。正确进行民主改革，不仅不会影响生产，而且由于扫除了封建反动势力，解放了生产力，使得生产效率大大提高。过去有人错误地认为，对封建反动势力也可用和平的“微风细雨”的方式进行教育改造，他们怀疑实行民主改革“是否会打乱企业”，“是否会影响生产”，事实证明这些看法是不正确的。必须充分发动群众，进行坚决斗争，才能彻底打垮封建反动势力。在民主改革运动中，虽然需要占用一些工时，但如果工作安排适当，有专人掌握业务，那末由于工人觉悟的提高，生产任务是可以完成的。如江岸铁路机厂五月份机车任务只完成百分之八十五点七，在民主改革运动中，六、七月份均完成百分之一百十二点五；五月份客车任务完成百分之一百五十，而六月份则完成百分之三百零四，并且质量也提高了。工人们在白天搞民主改革，化了一点工时，晚上都自动补上，工会干部到车间去劝都劝不走。民主改革不仅是人事的改革，制度的改革，而且是职工群众思想上的改造。因此在斗倒封建反动分子以后，应引导工人群众从阶级上来认识过去受压迫的原因，组织工人群众讨论：封建反动分子过去为什么敢横行霸道，是谁给他们撑腰的；过去工人为什么受压迫、吃不饱、穿不暖；今天工人为什么能报仇雪恨，翻身作主；使工人群众由仇恨过去而认识到今天新中国的可爱，认清必须巩固我们的国家，才能创造无限美好的将来，不再受帝国主义及其走狗欺侮压迫；必须热爱自己的祖国、自己的政党、自己的政府与工会组织；必须改革生产管理制度，展开生产竞赛，提高生产效率，实行经济核算制，为增强国家的经济力量与国防力量而奋斗。
    不骄不懈，深入展开民主改革运动！
    总的讲来，郑州铁路局在这一段民主改革运动中，基本上打倒了敌人，树立了工人群众的声威与正气，群众觉悟提高了，出现了一片新气象，有了不小的成绩。但是，还必须要实行民主团结，继续深入展开这一运动。最近某些单位在进行民主改革的第一阶段即民主斗争阶段以后，产生了骄傲自满情绪。有的认为民主改革已经结束了，个别领导干部怕群众提意见，有些群众也在想：“是否搞第二次民主改革？”他们还不了解民主改革是个完整的群众运动，这个运动不仅要打倒封建反动势力，并且还要树立新的思想作风，建立新的制度和新的人事关系，以便达到工人阶级内部团结，为发展生产创造便利条件。民主团结就是在民主斗争的胜利基础上进一步解决工人阶级内部的问题，是工人阶级内部严重的思想斗争，它将解决旧制度、旧作风、以及帮派小集团等问题。搞好民主团结的中心问题在于“放手民主，集中领导”。第一步必须动员群众，消除顾虑，使群众能“有什么，说什么”，然后引导群众检查生产工作。第二步必须把群众意见归纳起来，再交给群众讨论。第三步对于群众所提出的可以立即解决的问题，如思想作风等问题，采用批评与自我批评的方式来解决。对于生产制度等问题，则可以留到下一步来解决，以便进一步搞好生产。
