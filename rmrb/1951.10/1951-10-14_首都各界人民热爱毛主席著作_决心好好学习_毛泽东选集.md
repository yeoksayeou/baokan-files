    People from All Walks of Life in the Capital Love Chairman Mao's Writings and are Determined to Study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Well
   [Our Newspaper] People from all walks of life in the capital were extremely excited to learn about the publication of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. Thousands upon thousands of people want to buy a copy and study it carefully. After the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch published a notice in the newspaper on October 4th regarding collective registration for ordering the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, readers inquired about purchasing it on the same day, and the phone rang non-stop from morning to night. On October 12th, when the Wangfujing Street branch of Xinhua Bookstore began selling, readers formed a long queue of hundreds of people. Readers consciously observed order and there was no chaos. In one morning, all the Selected Works of Mao Zedong allocated to each branch that day were sold out. At around nine o'clock on the morning of the 12th, even before business hours, many readers crowded in front of the First Branch of the China Book Distribution Company, and everyone automatically lined up, excitedly waiting for the start of sales. In the lines of people buying books in front of various bookstores, there were staff from government offices, workers, soldiers, professors, students, and ordinary citizens, including international friends and white-haired elderly people. Some readers rushed over in a hurry, sweating profusely. Many students made a special trip from the western suburbs to the city to buy this book. Some people heard that the Selected Works of Mao Zedong would be released on the 12th and rushed to the bookstore early in the morning without eating breakfast. Some young people jumped up with joy after buying the book.
    At six o'clock on the morning of the 13th, readers who wanted to buy books were already waiting outside the Xinhua Bookstore again. The long line outside the Xinhua Bookstore on Wangfujing Street stretched three rows deep, and there were hundreds of people waiting at each branch on Xidan North Street, Qianmen Street, and Di'anmen Street. People buying books came from all walks of life. The owner of a clothing store in Qianmen, who was already very old, had been waiting outside the bookstore since six o'clock in the morning. He said, "I must buy a copy of Chairman Mao's book." The relatively quiet Liulichang also seemed lively because several bookstores on this street were selling the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. A vendor in front of the Xinhua Bookstore on Wangfujing Street said, "I have been doing business all my life, and I have never seen people buying books like this."
    The people of Beijing love Chairman Mao's great works so much. Zhao Jiaju from the Armored Forces said, "Today I came to the city to see a doctor at the Army Hospital. However, as soon as I saw the news of the publication of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong in the newspaper, I felt as if my illness was immediately much lighter, and I immediately ran to the bookstore to queue up, using my only remaining 15,000 yuan to buy a copy. Although I have read Chairman Mao's works before, they were very fragmented and unsystematic. This time, when I return to the army, I will definitely organize everyone to study hard, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and transform ourselves."
    Huang Hailian, an old worker who has worked at the Qixin Cement Company for twenty-three years, said happily after buying the Selected Works of Mao Zedong: "I am a man in my fifties, and my old brain has also become enlightened in the new society. I know that today's victory is given to us by Chairman Mao. After liberation, I read several of Chairman Mao's works, understood many principles, and recognized and criticized past mistakes. How did I understand the phrase 'Serve the people wholeheartedly' before? Everyone was unwilling to do more work, and I was happy to rest. Now it's different. Although I am old, I still have to work hard and study hard. On National Day, I saw Chairman Mao and heard the shout 'Long live worker comrades!' from the reviewing stand. I was so happy! Now that the Selected Works of Mao Zedong has been published, I will study it carefully, and if I don't understand anything, I must ask comrades with high theoretical knowledge and be Chairman Mao's little pupil. With Chairman Mao, we will always be glorious and always happy!"
    Comrade Qiao Guiqin from the Military Commission Surveying and Mapping Bureau joined the revolution in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region at the age of seventeen, and Chairman Mao's works greatly influenced her. While waiting to buy the Selected Works of Mao Zedong in the bookstore, she said: "When I encounter difficulties in my work, when I am not at ease in my work, I will think of Chairman Mao's words 'Serve the people wholeheartedly', and I will have the courage and strength to overcome everything, and continue to move forward optimistically. After a long period of education in the revolutionary ranks, I have become more firm in my ideology and stance! After I buy the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, I will study Mao Zedong Thought tirelessly, always be loyal to the revolutionary cause, and always be a good cadre of Chairman Mao!"

    首都各界人民热爱毛主席著作  决心好好学习“毛泽东选集”
   【本报讯】首都各界人民知道了毛泽东选集出版的消息，极为兴奋。成千成万的人都想买到一本，好好学习。新华书店北京分店十月四日在报上登出集体登记订购毛泽东选集的启事后，读者当天就纷纷询问有关购买的问题，电话从早到晚不停地响着。十月十二日，新华书店王府井大街门市部开始发售时，读者排成了几百人的长长的队伍。读者都自动遵守秩序，没有发生一点乱的现象。一上午的功夫，各门市部当天所分到的毛泽东选集就都卖完了。十二日早晨九点钟左右，还没有到营业时间，中国图书发行公司第一门市部的门口也就拥挤着很多读者，大家自动排好了队，兴奋地等待着开始发售。在各书店门口的买书的行列里，有机关工作人员、工人、战士、教授、学生和一般市民，其中还有国际友人，有白发苍苍的老人。有的读者很急地赶来，跑得满头是汗。有许多学生特意从西郊赶到城内来买这本书。有些人听说十二日开始发行毛泽东选集，大清早没吃饭就赶紧跑到书店门口等着。有的青年在买到书以后，高兴得蹦了起来。
    十三日早晨六点钟，购书的读者就又等在新华书店门外。王府井大街新华书店长长地排列了三行，西单北大街、前门大街、地安门大街各门市部都有数百人等着。买书的人，各阶层的都有。前门某服装店的一个掌柜的，已经很苍老了，从早晨六点多钟就等在书店门外，他说：“毛主席的书，我一定得买一部。”比较清静的琉璃厂，因为这条街上有几家书店代售毛泽东选集，也显得热闹了。王府井大街新华书店门口有一个摊贩说：“我作一辈子买卖，还没见过买书有这样的。”
    北京各界人民是如此地热爱毛主席的伟大著作。装甲兵赵家驹说：“今天我进城，是要上陆军医院看病的。可是，一看到报纸上登着毛泽东选集出版的消息，我就觉得似乎病立时轻了许多，马上跑到书店排队，拿我仅剩的一万五千元买了一本。以前我虽然读过毛主席的著作，但是非常零碎的，没有系统。这一次，我回到部队，一定要组织大家好好学习，以毛泽东的思想来武装自己，改造自己。”
    在启新洋灰公司工作二十三年的老工人黄海连，买到毛泽东选集后高兴地说：“我是一个五十多岁的人了，在新社会里老脑筋也开朗了，我知道今天的胜利果实是毛主席给我们的。解放后，我看了毛主席的几篇著作，明白了很多道理，认识和批判了过去的错误。早先我那懂得‘为人民服务’这句话？大家都不愿多干活，我也乐得休息休息。现在可不同了，我虽然上了年纪，但我还要好好劳动，努力学习。在国庆节那天，我看到了毛主席，也听见检阅台上喊‘工人同志们万岁！’我心里不用提多乐啦！这回，毛泽东选集出版了，我要好好地读它，不懂的地方一定要向理论高的同志问，做毛主席的小学生。有了毛主席，我们就永远光荣，永远幸福！”
    军委测绘局乔桂琴同志是十七岁那年在晋冀鲁豫边区参加革命的，毛主席著作大大地影响了她。她在书店等着买毛泽东选集时说：“当我在工作中遇到困难时，工作不安心时，我就会想起毛主席说的‘全心全意为人民服务’，也就有勇气和力量战胜了一切，又继续乐观地前进了。在革命队伍中经过长期的教育，我在思想上立场上更坚定了！我买了毛泽东选集以后，一定要永不倦怠地学习毛泽东思想，永远忠实于革命事业，永远做毛主席的好干部！”（若水、延华）
