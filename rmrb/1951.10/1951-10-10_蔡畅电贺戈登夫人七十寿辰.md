    On the occasion of your seventieth birthday, I, along with the women, mothers, and children of all of China, extend to you our warmest congratulations and highest respect.

    You are a great warrior in defense of world peace. We are honored and proud to have you—the leader who was awarded the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples"; your unwavering dedication to the truth is our noble example.

    We oppose and have protested against the persecution inflicted on you and the honest people of France by a handful of reactionary elements in France under the instigation of American imperialism. We are always concerned about your freedom and safety, and we are determined to continue, along with hundreds of millions of women around the world, under your leadership, to fight to the end against the conspiracy of American imperialism to intensify the instigation of a new world war and to defend world peace.

    We sincerely wish you good health and longevity.
