Van Fleet's Defeat in the First Round of the "Autumn Offensive"
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xia Gongran

From the command organs of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies to the frontline troops, everyone is delighted by the recent glorious victory on the Western Front. They say with full confidence: In just seven days, we annihilated more than 10,000 invading enemy troops there; if the enemy continues to launch such offensives, it will move towards its final defeat even faster.

The invading army's large-scale offensive on the Western Front this time was fully prepared in advance. The military adventure involved as many as five divisions, including the U.S. invading army's 1st Cavalry Division, 3rd Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, the British Commonwealth Division of the accomplice army, the 1st Division of the Li puppet army, the Turkish Brigade, the Greek Battalion, and troops from Puerto Rico and Belgium. This almost mobilized half of the seven divisions of the U.S. invading army in Korea and most of the accomplice troops of various countries except the Li puppet army, so Van Fleet dared to boast "the Allied Forces autumn offensive has begun" when launching the adventurous offensive. But after only a few days of fighting, the invading army under his command was battered by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies. Therefore, while American reporters exclaimed that "the Allied Forces encountered stubborn resistance from the Communists and could not move an inch," Van Fleet had to issue a deceptive statement that "the Allied Forces have ended the first phase of the autumn offensive," attempting to cover up the heavy defeat suffered in the frantic offensive.

Commanders and fighters of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies know that the U.S. aggressors are full of tricks. Therefore, since the Korean armistice negotiations began on July 10, they have always been on high alert, ready to defeat any possible sudden attack by the enemy. In the three months that the U.S. side deliberately sabotaged and delayed the armistice negotiations, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies defeated the enemy's so-called "summer limited objective offensive" on the Eastern and Central Fronts, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. According to statistics, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies annihilated more than 91,000 enemy troops and shot down or damaged 787 enemy aircraft in the two months from July 10 to September 30. However, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies are not satisfied with the glorious victory they have already achieved, and are still on guard against possible renewed adventurous offensives by the enemy with a high degree of vigilance and even stronger combat power.

On September 29, the invading army began a large-scale offensive in the Western Front area. The Chinese and Korean People's Armies bravely fought back against the invading army on a 40-kilometer stretch from Gowang Mountain in Gaolangpo-ri in the west, through Dahu-dong and Cheondeok Mountain, to north of Cheorwon in the east. Their battle slogan was: "Use the victory of annihilating the enemy as a gift for the National Day of the People's Republic of China!" In the battle, the infantry units used intensive mortar shells, various gunshots, and hand grenades to attack the enemy, and engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. The artillery units powerfully cooperated with the infantry in combat, using fierce artillery fire to bombard the enemy's tank formations, infantry units, and artillery units. They created brilliant achievements at Yeogeol Mountain and Cheondeok Mountain west of Cheorwon and Maryang Mountain northeast of Gaolangpo-ri. In the battle of Maryang Mountain, a brigade of the British accomplice army Commonwealth Division suffered heavy casualties. When the reporter interviewed in this battle line area, he saw the scene of the invading army's disastrous defeat. On the hills covered with autumn leaves and in the dark blue ravines, groups of bodies of invading army officers and soldiers were lying down, some with their limbs facing the sky, some with their heads resting on rocks, and some curled up next to trees. A volunteer soldier holding an automatic rifle he had just seized in battle excitedly pointed to a prisoner with a mournful face and said: "Look, he is a soldier of the so-called famous U.S. Ace Army, the 1st Cavalry Division." According to this prisoner, this was the biggest loss the division had suffered since invading Korea. They had not previously thought that the Chinese and Korean People's Armies had such powerful military strength. Taking the 2nd Company of the 5th Regiment of the division as an example, the company originally had more than 170 people, but after only a few days of fighting, only more than 70 people remained. A volunteer soldier said with a smile: This is the first "contribution" of Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive"! At present, the soldiers of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies are excitedly summarizing their combat experience, preparing to continue to welcome new and greater victories!

    范佛里特“秋季攻势”第一回合的败绩
    新华社记者  夏公然
    从中朝人民军队指挥机关到前线部队，每个人都为最近在西线的辉煌胜利而欢欣鼓舞。他们满怀信心地说：仅仅七天时间，我们就在那里歼灭了万余个疯狂进犯的侵略军；如果敌人继续发动这样的进攻，那末它会更快一点走向最后失败。
    侵略军这次在西线大举进犯是事先作了充分准备的。投入军事冒险的兵力有五师之多，包括美国侵略军骑兵第一师、步兵第三师、第二十五师、帮凶军英联邦师、李伪军第一师、土耳其旅、希腊营和波多黎各、比利时等部队。这几乎动用了在朝美国侵略军七个师的一半兵力及除李伪军以外的各国帮凶军的大部兵力，所以范佛里特在发动冒险进攻时胆敢吹嘘“联军秋季攻势开始”了。但仅仅几天战斗，他所指挥下的进犯军就被中朝人民军队打得焦头烂额。于是范佛里特在美国记者惊呼“联军遇到共军顽强抵抗，寸步不前”之际，不得不发表了一个“联军结束秋季攻势第一个阶段”的欺骗声明，企图以此掩盖其在疯狂进犯中所遭受的惨重败绩。
    中朝人民军队的指挥员和战斗员深知美国侵略者是诡计多端的。因此自七月十日朝鲜停战谈判开始以后，他们始终严阵以待，随时准备着击败敌人可能的突然进攻。在美方蓄意破坏和拖延停战谈判的三个月中，中朝人民军队在东线和中线打败了敌人的所谓“夏季目标有限的攻势”，使敌人遭受了惨重的损失。据统计：中朝人民军队自七月十日到九月三十日的两个多月中，共计歼灭敌军九万一千多人，击落击伤敌机七百八十七架。但中朝人民军队并不为已得到的辉煌胜利所满足，仍以高度的警惕性和更加强大的战斗力量，防范敌人可能再度发动的冒险进攻。
    九月二十九日，侵略军开始向西线地区大举进犯。中朝人民军队在西起高浪浦里的高旺山经大虎洞、天德山、东到铁原以北计四十公里长的地段上，奋勇迎击进犯军。他们的战斗口号是：“用消灭敌人的胜利作为对中华人民共和国国庆节的献礼！”在战斗中，步兵部队以密集的迫击炮弹、各种枪弹和手榴弹猛击敌人，并和敌人展开激烈的肉搏战。炮兵部队有力地配合步兵作战，用炽烈的炮火猛轰敌军的战车队、步兵部队和炮兵部队。他们在铁原以西的夜月山、天德山和高浪浦里东北的马良山，创造了光辉的战绩。在马良山战斗中，英国帮凶军联邦师的一个旅，死伤惨重。记者在这一带战线采访时，看到了侵略军惨败的景象。在秋叶蒙盖着的山岭上和暗蓝色的沟壑里，成群地倒卧着侵略军官兵的尸体，他们有的四肢朝天，有的头卧在岩石上，有的蜷曲地倒在树旁。一位擎着才从战斗中缴来的自动步枪的志愿军战士兴奋地指着一个哭丧着脸的俘虏说：“你看，他就是所谓鼎鼎大名的美国王牌军骑一师的兵。”据这个俘虏供称：这次是该师侵朝以来遭受损失最大的一仗，在以前他们没有想到中朝人民军队有这样强大的军事力量。以该师第五团第二连为例，该连原有一百七十余人，而经过短短几天的战斗后，目前只剩下了七十多人。一个志愿军战士微笑着说：这就是范佛里特“秋季攻势”的第一个“功劳”吧！目前，中朝人民部队将士们正在兴奋地总结战斗经验，准备继续迎接新的更大的胜利！
