    Brief Commentary on Economic Life

    Eliminate Anarchy in Capital Construction
    Hengshui Distillery, a subsidiary of the Hebei Provincial Branch of the North China Liquor Industry Monopoly General Company, arbitrarily altered the original engineering plan without the approval of higher-level leading authorities during capital construction this year, causing significant difficulties. In order to build more offices and dormitories, the distillery changed the planned three warehouses to two, and replaced a planned new distillery building with a repaired old distiller's yeast production workshop, using the funds to build thirteen offices and fifty-seven dormitories. As a result, the state will have to increase investment in the future to build a distiller's yeast production workshop, and the distillery's 1952 distiller's yeast production plan will be seriously affected.
    In terms of scale, this matter itself is not very large, but its nature is very serious. Because Hengshui Distillery has disrupted the state's economic plan in this matter. In essence, this is an anarchic act of acting independently. In our economic construction, what should be built first, what should be built later, which products should be produced more, and which products should be produced less, are all within the state's overall plan. If one unit does not comply with the plan and acts without authorization, there will be a disconnect. Everyone should oppose this anarchic phenomenon.

    经济生活简评
    清除基本建设中的无政府现象
    华北酒业专卖总公司所属河北省分公司衡水酒厂，在今年进行基本建设时，不经上级领导机关批准，擅自变更原有的工程计划，造成了很大的困难。该厂为了多建筑一些办公室和宿舍，就把计划中的三幢仓库改为二幢，把计划中应该新建的一座造酒厂房，改用修补过的旧曲房顶替，而用这些资金，建筑了十三间办公室、五十七间宿舍。这样一来，不但国家在将来必须增加投资以建筑曲房，并使该厂一九五二年的产曲计划受到严重影响。
    就规模来说，这件事情的本身并不很大，但其性质是很严重的。因为衡水酒厂在这件事情上破坏了国家的经济计划。从本质上说，这是一种各自为政的无政府的行为。在我们的经济建设中，先建设什么，后建设什么，那些产品应该多生产，那些产品应该少生产，都在国家的统筹计划之中。有一个单位不遵守计划而擅自行动，就将产生脱节现象。大家应反对这种无政府的现象。
