Correcting the "Eating from the Big Pot" Mentality of Some Rural Party Members
		Yao Zhe

Agricultural socialist thought has already been criticized; however, this kind of thinking has resurfaced in some newly liberated areas, hindering the development of agricultural production. For example, Liu Quanmu, a Communist Party member from Zhouzhuang Township, Fifth District, Xiangcheng, Henan, mistakenly told his wife: "Now the Soviet Union has embarked on 'socialism'! Everyone works together, everyone rests together, and even changes clothes together. Young women all wear colorful striped cloth, and old people all wear dark blue serge. There's no distinction between rich and poor; everyone has food and clothing. Don't look at how enthusiastically people are working in our village; soon everything will be public and enter 'socialism'! It's enough for us to have food and clothing!" In addition, many Party members believe that mutual aid teams are "socialism." Qin Gelin's mutual aid team collectively discussed "taking the socialist path" during the summer. Their plan was: First, after this autumn harvest, they would jointly build three tile-roofed houses as cattle sheds so that they could pool all the team's livestock together next spring; second, they would persuade their family members to stack wheat straw together next year. They planned to achieve "eating from the big pot" and "merging into a big circle" within three years. This kind of thinking quickly spread among the masses, adversely affecting production. According to investigations, within twenty-seven mutual aid teams, some people were waiting for "socialism" and longing for "socialism"; others were afraid of "socialism." Individual farmers were even more unwilling to join mutual aid teams, believing that joining a mutual aid team meant embarking on the "socialist" road. As a result, mutual aid teams could not be consolidated and developed and collapsed one after another. Middle peasant Han Songlin said: "Anyway, we'll eventually become 'socialist,' so having food and clothing is enough; let's just merge." Some people began to eat, drink, and waste resources, unwilling to engage in good production.

This agricultural socialist thought is completely wrong. It attempts to implement so-called "eating from the big pot" and "merging into a big circle" based on an isolated and individual small-scale production economy, using absolutely egalitarian methods. As a result, it inevitably destroys social productive forces. In Zhouzhuang Township, some people did not engage in good production because they were waiting for "socialism" and longing for "socialism," or because they were afraid of "socialism." Therefore, rural Party organizations must struggle against this erroneous thought. First, they should conduct communist education among Party members, criticize and correct this agricultural socialist thought, and make everyone correctly understand that in communist society, only the means of production such as land, factories, and mines are publicly owned; things to eat, wear, and use in daily life still belong to individuals. Then, they should mobilize every Party member to conduct patriotic production education among the poor and hired peasants who have been allocated land and property during the land reform, encouraging them to work hard, improve production methods, and rely on mutual aid organizations to further improve their economic situation. They must not wait for "socialism." Patriotic production education should also be conducted for middle peasants and others to dispel their production concerns, and the necessary rewards for increasing production should continue to be implemented.

    纠正某些农村党员的“吃大锅饭”思想
    姚哲
    农业社会主义思想，已经被批判过了；但是有些新解放地区又滋长了这种思想，阻碍着农业生产的发展。例如河南襄城五区周庄乡共产党员刘全木就错误地对他老婆说：“现在苏联已走上‘社会’（即社会主义，下同）啦！干活齐干活，休息都休息，换衣服也是一齐换，年轻妇女一色花条子布，老年人全是黑青青的斜文呢，不分穷富有吃有穿，你别看咱庄那些人干得红，快要归公入‘社会’啦！咱们有吃有穿就中啦！”另外有许多党员认为互助组就是“社会主义”。秦格林领导的互助组，在夏天大家就在一齐商量着“走社会主义”的道路。他们的计划是：第一条，今年秋后合伙盖三间瓦屋作牛屋，明春可把全组牲口向一块拼兑；第二条，分别打通家里人的思想，明年麦秸垛在一起。他们计划在三年内作到“吃大锅饭”、“合大圈子”。这种思想很快在群众中散播开，使生产受了不利影响。据调查，在二十七个互助组内，有一部分人等“社会主义”、盼“社会主义”；有一部分人怕“社会主义”。单干户更不愿意参加互助组了，认为入了互助组就得走“社会主义”的路。这样，互助组就得不到巩固与发展，纷纷垮台。中农韩松林说：“反正早晚得‘社会’，有吃有穿算啦，合圈就合圈。”有的开始吃喝浪费，不愿好好生产。
    这种农业社会主义思想是完全错误的。它企图在孤立的单个小生产的经济基础上，用绝对平均主义的办法实行所谓“吃大锅饭”“合大圈子”。其结果，必然破坏了社会生产力。周庄乡就有人因为等“社会主义”盼“社会主义”；或怕“社会主义”而不好好生产。因此，农村党组织必须与这种错误思想进行斗争，首先应当在党员中进行共产主义教育，批判和纠正这种农业社会主义思想，使大家正确地认识：在共产主义社会中，只有土地、工厂、矿山等等生产资料是公有的；吃的穿的和生活中所需用的东西，还是归各人所有。然后发动每个党员，对在土地改革中分得土地财产的贫农与雇农，进行爱国生产教育，鼓励他们努力生产，改进生产方法，依靠互助组织，以进一步改善自己的经济状况，决不能等待“社会主义”。对中农及其他人也要进行爱国丰产的教育，打破其生产顾虑，并继续实行对于提高生产的必要奖励。
