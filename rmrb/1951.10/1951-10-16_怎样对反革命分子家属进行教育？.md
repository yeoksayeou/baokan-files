How to Educate the Families of Counter-Revolutionaries?
       Wei Guang
    Educating the families of counter-revolutionaries is an indispensable part of the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities. Currently, places that have already conducted education for the families of counter-revolutionaries, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Gui Sui, Guangdong, and eastern Sichuan, have achieved good results. The worries of the families of counter-revolutionaries have been greatly reduced, and their understanding of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has also increased. Therefore, some family members of counter-revolutionaries have expressed that their relatives "deserved their punishment and would not complain even if they died"; some have further exposed the crimes of counter-revolutionaries and expressed their willingness to assist the government in reporting counter-revolutionaries; some have reported the guns and bullets hidden in their homes; some have used letters to report special agents still engaged in counter-revolutionary activities; some have proposed that they will work hard in production in the future and have formulated patriotic covenants to abide by government decrees and help other family members of counter-revolutionaries make progress. All this shows that educating the families of counter-revolutionaries has great significance for consolidating social order and isolating a small number of counter-revolutionaries, and it is a task that all regions need to carry out well.

    Holding Symposiums is the Main Method

    The best way to conduct a universal education for the families of counter-revolutionaries is for the public security departments to hold symposiums for them. How can we make this kind of meeting a success? The experience of various places is:

    1.  First of all, explain the policies at the meeting to dispel the concerns of the families of counter-revolutionaries. Their main concerns are "fear of being implicated" and "fear of confiscation of property." Therefore, first, it should be made clear that the People's Government only punishes the counter-revolutionaries themselves and will never implicate family members who have not actively participated in counter-revolutionary activities; second, the second item in the Government Administration Council's "Regulations on the Confiscation of Property of Counter-Revolutionary Criminals" should be explained, clarifying the government's leniency and differentiated treatment towards the families of counter-revolutionaries who have not actively participated in counter-revolutionary activities; third, it should be made clear that as long as they can stand on the side of the people in the future and work hard in production, the government and the people will never discriminate against them, nor will they interfere in some of their life issues. Clarifying the above issues can dispel their concerns, thereby reducing their antagonism and unease towards the People's Government, which is conducive to further education.

    2.  Educate those among the families of counter-revolutionaries who have a better understanding or have shown more initiative in advance, so that they can enlighten other family members at the meeting. Because among the children of counter-revolutionaries, some are still members of the New Democratic Youth League; some wives of counter-revolutionaries were forcibly occupied; and some family members have been abused and oppressed by counter-revolutionaries in the past. These people are more likely to sympathize with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, educating these people before the meeting and having them expose the crimes of counter-revolutionaries and express their support for the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries at the meeting is a very practical education for other family members. This is how Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, guided other family members of counter-revolutionaries to speak at the meeting. After the family members of counter-revolutionaries have spoken more generally at the meeting, government personnel should analyze and solve their ideological situation and the problems they have raised, and focus on pointing out their future and the attitudes they should adopt in the future.

    3.  Making good preparations for the investigation of the families of counter-revolutionaries and the meeting is the key to holding a successful symposium. The ideological situation, attitude, performance, and the problems that may be raised at the meeting by the families of counter-revolutionaries should be investigated and studied before the meeting, so that education can be carried out at the meeting in light of their ideological situation. When carrying out this work, some urban public security departments, in conjunction with the Women's Federation, organized visiting groups, and some places used local security groups to visit the families of counter-revolutionaries. This visit is both to understand the situation and to provide specific education to them. In addition, some places have also absorbed a small number of activists from the masses to participate in the symposium. The mass activists who participate in the symposium must also be educated so that they can guide the family members of counter-revolutionaries to speak at the meeting and regularly educate the family members of counter-revolutionaries after the meeting.

    Grasp the Education of Young Students Among the Families of Counter-Revolutionaries

    Among the families of counter-revolutionaries, there are some young students who mostly express support for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; but some express distress and unease; and a few are even resentful and attempt to retaliate against the people. Therefore, repeated political education must be carried out to make them distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. The authorities of middle and higher schools and the organizations of the Youth League and student unions should pay special attention to this work. Schools should point out to them through symposiums, individual talks, or political reports that although they are the children of counter-revolutionaries, the government still holds an attitude of love and education towards them, and they should recognize their future, study hard, and pursue progress. It should also be explained that only those who are stubbornly unrepentant and attempt to carry out counter-revolutionary retaliation will be spurned by the people and will be subject to the discipline and stricter punishment of the government and the people.

    After these students return home on vacation or for other reasons, the local people's governments and the organizations of the Communist Party and the Youth League should take the initiative to explain to them the local situation of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and carry out some specific explanations and education work. At present, it is wrong for some district and village cadres to adopt a discriminatory and indifferent attitude towards them, which is not beneficial to the country and the people.

    Organize the Masses to Conduct Regular Education for the Families of Counter-Revolutionaries

    It is not enough to educate the families of counter-revolutionaries only by holding a symposium. The public security departments in various places must be responsible for organizing the strength of the masses to carry out regular education in various ways: 1. The public security committees should regularly check and understand the ideological situation of the families of counter-revolutionaries, and organize activists among the people to properly divide the work to conduct individual talks with them. Those who are law-abiding and actively pursuing progress should be encouraged, and individual bad ones should be supervised and criticized. 2. Pay attention to absorbing them to participate in mass political and cultural activities, such as night schools, reading groups, and residents' meetings. They should not be discriminated against and excluded from mass cultural and educational activities, but should be urged to participate in various activities so that they can be regularly educated. 3. Conduct education for the families of counter-revolutionaries through the inspection and revision of patriotic covenants. The clause on supporting the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the patriotic covenant should be particularly emphasized among them and should be formulated specifically. For example, "Do not sympathize with counter-revolutionaries, do not oppose the people," "Assist the government in reporting, secretly reporting, or collecting materials on the activities of counter-revolutionaries," "Abide by the law and do not associate with bad people," are all relatively specific and educational contents. 4. Educating the more active members of the families of counter-revolutionaries to educate the general families of counter-revolutionaries is also a method that should be used; but the public security police stations or public security committees should provide them with serious help and education.

    怎样对反革命分子家属进行教育？
       魏光
    对反革命分子家属进行教育，是镇压反革命运动中一项不可缺少的工作。目前凡已对反革命分子家属进行了教育的地方，如北京、天津、张家口、归绥、广东、川东等地，都收到了很好的效果。使反革命分子家属的顾虑大大减少，对镇压反革命的认识也提高了。因此，有的反革命分子家属表示自己的亲属是“罪有应得，死了也不屈”；有的进一步揭发了反革命分子的罪行，并表示愿意协助政府检举反革命分子；有的报出了自己家里匿藏着的枪枝与子弹；有的用书信检举了还在做反革命活动的特务分子；有的提出今后要好好劳动生产，并订出了遵守政府法令，帮助其他反革命分子家属进步的爱国公约。这一切，都说明了对反革命分子家属进行教育，对巩固社会秩序，孤立少数反革命分子，都有其重大意义，是各地都需要很好进行的一项工作。
    召开座谈会是主要方式
    对反革命分子家属进行一次普遍教育的最好方式，是由公安部门召开反革命分子家属座谈会。怎样才能把这种会开好呢？各地的经验是：
    一、在会上首先向反革命分子家属讲明政策，以打破其顾虑。他们主要的顾虑是“怕受牵连”，“怕没收财产”。因此，第一应讲明人民政府只惩办反革命分子本人，决不牵连其未积极参加反革命活动的家属；第二应解释政务院关于“没收反革命罪犯财产的规定”中的第二项，说明政府对未积极参与反革命活动的反革命分子家属的宽大与分别对待的政策；第三，讲明今后只要能站在人民的立场上，好好劳动生产，政府和人民决不歧视他们，对他们生活中的一些问题也不会加以干涉。讲清上述问题，即可打破他们的顾虑，从而减除他们与人民政府对立以及不安的情绪，便于进一步进行教育。
    二、事先教育反革命分子家属中认识较好或表现较积极的，在会上对其他家属进行启发教育。因为在反革命分子的子女中，有个别的还是新民主主义青年团团员；有些反革命分子的妻子，是被强迫霸占的；还有些家属，过去曾受了反革命分子的虐待和欺压，这些人，比较易于同情镇压反革命。因此，会前对这些人进行教育，由他们在会上揭发反革命分子的罪行，表示拥护政府镇压反革命，这对其他家属是一个很实际的教育。广东韶关市就是这样引导其他反革命分子家属在会上发言的。在会上，反革命分子家属较普遍地发言之后，政府人员应针对他们的思想情况和他们提出来的问题，加以分析与解决，并着重指出他们的前途及今后所应采取的态度。
    三、会前作好对反革命分子家属的调查与会议的准备工作，是开好座谈会的关键。反革命分子家属的思想情况、态度、表现以及在会上可能提出来的问题等，都应于会前进行调查研究，以便能在会上针对其思想情况进行教育。进行这一工作时，有的城市公安部门协同家庭妇女联合会组织了访问小组，有的地方运用当地的治安小组对反革命分子家属进行了访问。这种访问，一方面是了解情况，一方面是向他们进行具体教育。此外，还有的地方在召开座谈会时，吸收了群众中的少数积极分子参加。对于参加座谈会的群众积极分子，也须进行教育，使他们在会上能引导反革命分子家属发言，在会后能经常教育反革命分子家属。
    对反革命分子家属中的青年学生应抓紧进行教育
    在反革命分子家属中，有一部分青年学生，他们对镇压反革命，多半表示拥护；但也有的表示苦闷和不安；少数的更怀恨在心，企图向人民进行报复。因此，必须对他们进行反复的政治教育，使其分清敌我。各地的中等以上学校当局及青年团、学生会的组织，更应特别注意这项工作。各学校应该通过座谈会、个别谈话或政治报告等方式，向他们指出，他们虽是反革命分子的子女，但政府对他们仍是抱着爱护与教育的态度，他们应该认清前途，努力学习，追求进步。并说明只有个别执迷不悟，企图进行反革命报复者，才会被人民唾弃，才会遭到政府和人民的管教与更严厉的惩处。
    这些学生于假期或因事回家后，当地人民政府和共产党、青年团的组织，应主动向他们说明当地镇压反革命的情况，并进行一些具体的解释与教育工作。目前，有的区、村干部对他们采取歧视、不问的态度是不对的，这对国家和人民是不利的。
    组织群众对反革命分子家属
    进行经常教育
    对反革命分子家属的教育，只凭召开一次座谈会是不够的，还必须由各地公安部门负责组织群众力量，用各种方式来进行经常的教育：一、治安保卫委员会应定期检查与了解反革命分子家属的思想情况，并组织人民群众中的积极分子适当分工对他们进行个别谈话，对其中安分守己、积极追求进步者应予以鼓励，对个别坏的应予以监督和批评。二、注意吸收他们参加群众性的政治的和文化的活动，如夜校、读报组、居民会等。不应在群众性的文化教育活动中歧视和排斥他们，而应督促他们参加各种活动，以便使他们经常受到教育。三、通过爱国公约的检查与修订，来对反革命分子家属进行教育。爱国公约中对拥护政府镇压反革命这一条，应在他们中特别强调，并要订得具体。如：“不同情反革命，不向人民闹对立”，“协助政府检举、密告或搜集反革命分子活动的材料”，“奉公守法、不与坏人来往”等，都是比较具体而又有教育意义的内容。四、教育反革命分子家属中较积极的分子，去向一般反革命家属进行教育，也是应该运用的方式；但公安派出所或治安保卫委员会应对他们认真帮助和教育。
