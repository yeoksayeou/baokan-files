    The Chinese Medical Association Sends Respects to Volunteer Army Medical Workers
    On the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war, the Chinese Medical Association sent a telegram to express its respect to all medical personnel of the Volunteer Army. The telegram stated: Over the past year, the Chinese People's Volunteers have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, which has been admired by the whole world. You, who are wholeheartedly serving the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army, have also gained the respect of people at home and abroad. In the most arduous combat environment and under the most difficult material conditions, you have completed the task of rescuing and treating the wounded and sick. For example, comrades Tian Maoxiang and Song Guanqun disregarded everything to rescue the wounded under enemy strafing and bombing. These glorious deeds have been endlessly spread in people's books, newspapers and by word of mouth. Today—on the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war, we would like to represent all members of the Chinese Medical Association across the country to extend our high respect and cordial greetings to our comrades working at the front, and to learn from you in a practical way.
    In the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, many of our members also participated in volunteer surgical teams, medical and epidemic prevention service teams, and health work teams to go to the front. Some became models and made meritorious contributions; those who remained in the rear are also engaged in various medical and health research and treatment work with great enthusiasm, and are always ready to go to the front. Under the call of the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea, we actively participated in the donation movement. In the actual movement, we have more deeply realized the greatness of the comrades working at the front, and we have also further understood the powerful and infinite strength hidden in our people. We believe that the cause of resisting America and aiding Korea—defending world peace—will surely be victorious.
    Facts have already taught us that only by strengthening our own strength can peace be guaranteed; we must participate in national defense and health construction with more strength to ensure the health of our people's army. This is our mission and task. Comrades, you have set a good example in this regard, and we must follow in your footsteps.

    中华医学总会电志愿军医务工作者致敬
    中华医学会总会在志愿军出国作战一周年纪念日，特致电向志愿军全体医务工作人员致敬。电文说：一年来，中国人民志愿军所表现的高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，已为全世界所景仰。专心一意为志愿军伤病员服务的你们，也同样得到了国内外人民的尊敬。你们在最艰苦的战斗环境中，最艰难的物质条件下，完成了对伤病员抢救医疗的任务。如田茂祥、宋冠群等同志，在敌机扫射轰炸下，不顾一切去抢救伤员。这些光辉灿烂的事迹，已在人民的书报和口头上传颂不绝。在今天——中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年纪念的日子，我们要代表全国的中华医学会会员，向你们在前方工作的同志致以崇高的敬礼和亲切的慰问，并要切实地向你们学习。
    在抗美援朝运动中，我们也曾有很多会员，参加了志愿手术队、医防服务队、卫生工作队等奔赴前方，有些人成了模范，立了功；留在后方的人们，也正在以高度的热情，从事各种医药卫生的研究和治疗工作，并时刻准备到前方去。在抗美援朝总会的号召下，我们积极参加了捐献运动。在实际运动中，我们更体会了前方工作同志的伟大，并且更了解到我们人民中间蕴藏着的强大无穷的力量，我们相信抗美援朝——保卫世界和平的事业必然胜利。
    事实已经教育我们，只有加强自己的力量，才能使和平有保障；我们必须以更多的力量参加国防卫生建设，保障我们人民军队的健康，这就是我们的使命和任务。同志们，在这方面你们已做了很好的示范，我们要跟着你们的足迹前进。
