    The Achievements of Harnessing the Huai River Demonstrate the Superiority of the People's Democratic System
    Editor:
    After reading the newsletter about harnessing the Huai River published on the second page of the People's Daily on September 22nd, I was extremely excited. I have a few thoughts and a suggestion.
    First, I believe that the principle of "combining storage and drainage" for harnessing the Huai River, which starts from the overall situation of the Huai River and considers the comprehensive and long-term interests of the people, is a concrete application of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Such a great project would have been unimaginable in the era of reactionary class rule.
    Second, the Party's strong leadership is the fundamental factor determining the victory of harnessing the Huai River. The organization of millions of laborers, the heavy transportation work, and the complex technical work were all unprecedented in Chinese history, but under the leadership of the Party, they were all resolved very well.
    Third, in the process of harnessing the Huai River, the worker-peasant alliance demonstrated unparalleled power. More than 10,000 workers in Shanghai rushed to manufacture the sluice gate machinery for the Runheji Diversion Sluice in two months; skilled workers in riveting and mixing cement taught the peasants technical skills in a very short time, expanding the ranks of technical workers and enabling the project to be completed on schedule. Millions of peasants completed nearly 200 million cubic meters of earthwork (including all the earthwork for repairing and dredging ditches) in eight months, equivalent to excavating three Suez Canals (the Suez Canal took ten years to build under the direction of the so-called "industrially advanced" Britain and France).
    The People's Republic of China has created such outstanding achievements in water conservancy only two years after its founding, which undeniably demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's democratic system.
    I heard from classmates at my school who returned from participating in the Huai River harnessing project that there were many moving stories in the project. For example, during the construction of the Runheji Diversion Sluice, there was a heavy rain one night, and the river water rose sharply. At 1:00 AM, Chief Commander Qian Zhengying took a signalman, went around the upper reaches of the Huai River, braved the dangerous, turbulent river, to inspect the construction site, which was extremely touching. Another example is that Soviet expert Comrade Bukov personally went to the site, conducted in-depth exploration, carefully planned, and patiently fought against conservative technical viewpoints, which made people sincerely convinced. These facts have made me deeply aware of the superiority of the people's democratic system and the greatness of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    I suggest that relevant departments shoot a film about harnessing the Huai River with the theme of illustrating the superiority of our excellent people's democratic system. This film will play a huge role in educating the people.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Xu Dezhi's suggestion to shoot a film about harnessing the Huai River with the theme of illustrating the superiority of the people's democratic system is a very good one. The Central Film Bureau attaches great importance to shooting a film about harnessing the Huai River; it is currently shooting a documentary and plans to shoot a feature film.

### 治淮的成就显示了人民民主制度的优越性

    治淮的成就显示了人民民主制度的优越性编辑同志：
    读了九月二十二日人民日报第二版刊载的治淮通讯后，我兴奋极了。我有几点体会和一个建议。
    首先，我认为从淮河整个情况出发，为人民的全面利益、长远利益着想的“蓄泄兼筹”的治淮方针，是马列主义、毛泽东思想的具体运用；这种伟大工程，在反动阶级统治时代是不可能想像的。
    其次，党的坚强领导，是决定治淮胜利的基本因素。数百万民工的组织工作，繁重的运输工作，复杂的技术工作，在中国历史上都是空前的，但在党的领导下，全都解决得很好。
    第三，在治淮中，工农联盟显示了无比的威力。上海一万多工人在两个月内赶制出了润河集分水闸的闸门机械；打铆钉、拌洋灰的技术工人，在很短的时间内，把技术教给农民兄弟，扩大了技术工作的队伍，使工程能按期完成。数百万农民，在八个月的时间内，完成了将近两亿立方公尺的土方（包括修理、疏浚沟洫等工程的全部土方），相当于开挖三条苏彝士运河的全部土工（苏彝士运河在号称“工业先进”的英国和法国主持下，竟挖了十年）。
    中华人民共和国刚刚成立两年，就在水利方面创造了这样突出的成绩，无可置辩地说明了人民民主制度的无比优越性。
    我听本校参加治淮归来的同学说，在治淮工程中，还有许多动人的故事。例如：在润河集分水闸工程进行期间，某夜大雨，河水陡涨。夜半一点钟，总指挥钱正英同志带了一个通讯员，绕到淮河上游，冒着生命的危险，渡过波涛汹涌的河道，去视察工地，令人感动异常。又如苏联专家布科夫同志亲临现场，深入探测，精细规划，耐心地与保守的技术观点作斗争，使人心悦诚服。这些事实，使我深刻地认识到人民民主制度的优越性和中苏友谊的伟大。
    我建议有关方面，拍摄一部以我国优越的人民民主制度为主题的治淮影片，这部影片，对于教育人民，将要发生巨大的作用。

    编者按：徐德治同志建议拍摄一部以说明人民民主制度的优越性为主题的治淮影片，这个意见是很好的。中央电影局对于拍摄治淮电影，非常重视；现正拍摄纪录片，并计划拍摄艺术片。
