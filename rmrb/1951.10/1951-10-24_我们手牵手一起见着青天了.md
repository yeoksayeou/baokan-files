Chairman Mao:

You are like the bright moon in the dark night, illuminating the mountains, illuminating the plains, illuminating everything.

You are like the sun in winter, melting the frost and snow, warming the plants, warming the hungry and ragged poor people, warming everything!

Chairman Mao, we are the Lisu and Yi people living in Jianchuan. Most of us moved here from other places. Before liberation, we guarded the mountains and watched the posts for the local ethnic minority landlords, living in deep mountains and wild forests. For many years, we suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. We were underfed and poorly clothed, and our pain and hatred were like thousands of mountains and rivers. However, thanks to your and the Communist Party's leadership, and the struggle of the People's Liberation Army, we, who had not seen the blue sky for a long time, held hands and saw the blue sky together. The heavy stone slabs that weighed on our heads also fell, and we can freely speak, freely sing, freely dance, and work hard in production. We are happy, and our days are getting better and better. Chairman Mao, you are the savior of our fraternal ethnic groups. We thank you, and we will let our children and grandchildren thank you too!

We have finally turned ourselves over, but our cultural level is not high, and we understand the policies little, which makes it inconvenient to do things. Therefore, seventy-eight of us took the opportunity to visit the "Horse and Mule Fair" to hold a unity forum. Comrades from the county government came to talk about various policies. We listened to the reports on ethnic unity, stepping up production, and resisting America and aiding Korea. We felt that the propositions in these reports were very much in line with our hearts, and our courage to do things also increased a bit. We guarantee that after we go back, we will unite even more closely, work even harder in production, and use practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, and defeat the American aggressors, who are like jackals, wolves, and tigers.

Respectfully wishing you health and longevity!
Yunnan Province Jianchuan County Lisu and Yi Ethnic Unity Forum

    我们手牵手一起见着青天了毛主席：
    您好比黑夜的明月，照亮了山头，照亮了平地，照亮了一切。
    您好比冬天的太阳，融化了霜雪，照暖了草木，照暖了肚饿衣褴的穷苦人民，照暖了一切！
    毛主席，我们是住在剑川的傈僳族和彝族，大部分是从别的地方搬来的，解放前我们给当地的民家族护山看哨，住在深山野箐里，多少年来受尽了国民党反动统治的压迫剥削，吃不饱、穿不暖，痛苦和仇恨像千山万水。但是，靠你和共产党的领导，人民解放军的奋斗，我们久不见过青天的人们，手牵着手一起见着青天了，重重地压在我们头上的石板也倒掉了，我们自由地说，自由地唱，自由地跳，努力地生产。我们快乐，我们的日子一天比一天的好。毛主席，你是我们各兄弟民族的救星，我们感谢你，让我们的子子孙孙也要感谢你！
    我们到底翻身了，但是文化不大高，政策懂得少，做起事来不方便，因此，我们七十八个人趁着来参观“骡马会”的机会，召开团结座谈会。县政府的同志们来讲各种政策，我们听了关于民族团结，加紧生产和抗美援朝的报告，觉得这些报告中的主张十分合我们的心意，做事的胆子也大了一点。我们保证回去了后，更加紧地团结，更努力地生产，用实际行动抗美援朝，打败豺狼虎豹一样的美国侵略者。
    敬祝你健康万岁！
