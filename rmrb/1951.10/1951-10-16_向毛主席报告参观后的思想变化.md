Reporting to Chairman Mao on Ideological Changes After the Visit

Recognizing the Great Leading Role of the Working Class, Willing to Work Hard to Produce and Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance

Dear Chairman Mao:

With great excitement, we report to you on the situation of the 307 representatives from Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, who visited the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin.

We arrived in Tianjin on October 4th and visited for seven days. From the time we left our homes to Tianjin, we were warmly welcomed and received by the worker brothers and the urban people everywhere. We traveled in special trains and stayed in very comfortable places in Tianjin. The worker brothers warmly and patiently taught us common sense about urban life. They guided us on the streets, making it very convenient for those of us who did not understand urban life and eliminating our concerns about coming to the city. Our farmer representatives were respected everywhere, and we enjoyed discounted prices when buying things. Mr. Mei Lanfang also performed specifically for us. We received unprecedented warm welcomes, receptions, and respect. We felt infinitely honored. Our remaining old ideas about cities were swept away. In the past, when we farmers went to the city, we were despised, antagonized, and oppressed by the reactionary ruling class. They made fun of us, which made us dislike cities. If there was any way to avoid it, we did not want to enter the city. Our urban and rural people were separated because of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. But after this visit, we deeply realized that under your leadership and in our new democratic social system, urban and rural people are closely united, urban and rural areas are helping each other, and the phenomenon of separation no longer exists. We deeply felt that the status of the working people has been greatly improved, and the working people truly have infinite glory. But we have only obtained this glory and happiness under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party. Without your correct leadership and the correct leadership of the Communist Party, it would be absolutely impossible.

Dear Chairman Mao, we also want to tell you that after visiting the exhibition and Tianjin, our horizons have been broadened. We have seen with our own eyes the rich resources of our motherland and the various valuable goods produced, as well as the great cities of our motherland, which have made us feel even more the greatness and loveliness of our motherland. We all live in scattered and backward rural areas, have never been to big cities, have never seen trams, and have never seen so many products from all over our motherland, nor have we personally seen the advanced industrial construction of our motherland. This time, in Tianjin and in the exhibition hall, we saw most of the various things mentioned above. We also took trams and elevators. All of this opened up a new path in our thinking, allowing us to see the prospects of the future new society. In the past, we often heard about the beauty and happiness of socialist and communist societies, but we did not understand it deeply. After this visit, we fully believe that in the future our vast rural areas can completely develop in the direction of modernization and industrialization, and we can completely realize our ideal society. In the past, we thought it was a big deal to have a cow. Now that we have seen the machines created by the worker brothers and the greatness of modern cities, we feel that our efforts are still too small and that we must improve production. As long as our urban and rural people, especially our worker and peasant brothers, unite and work hard, strengthen production, consolidate national defense, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, a more beautiful and ideal society can be achieved quickly.

Respected Chairman Mao, how can we not be happy when we see such a great and lovely motherland and see the prospects for our rural areas? How can we not protect her? How can we not actively strive for production, boost our spirits, and accelerate her construction? Dear Chairman Mao, we vow to fight for the protection of everything in the motherland and do our best to build it.

In the past, we also heard about the greatness of the working class, that only the working class can lead us to turn over and lead us to build a new society and move towards a socialist society. After this visit, we have a greater understanding of the greatness of the working class. Some of our representatives said: "There is nothing in the world that the working class can create more than new things. We can only use machines under the leadership of the working class, move towards modernization and industrialization, and move towards a happy society." All of our representatives agree with this sentence. Why? Take the machines we saw, for example: The worker brothers in Tianjin manufactured the first domestically produced new-style car this year; the workers in Taiyuan made tractors; the workers in Tianjin invented an engine test stand that can save 60,000 catties of grain a year; they invented a paper machine that can produce two sheets of paper at a time, increasing production by 70 percent; they manufactured machines for agricultural use, which are many times faster than our manual labor. From the train we took when we came: a journey of nearly 2,000 li took just over two days. If we walked, it would take more than a month. Furthermore, the great city construction of Tianjin would be impossible for us farmers without the worker brothers. They have not only increased production and supported agriculture, giving play to the spirit of independence and self-reliance of the Chinese people, but also dealt a great blow to the imperialist blockade. Therefore, we must produce well, provide the worker brothers with grain and raw materials, and let the worker brothers manufacture more machines for us to use to improve agricultural production. Otherwise, we cannot move forward without the leadership of the worker brothers, and we cannot improve our agricultural production.

Dear Chairman Mao, after visiting the Heavy Industry and Agricultural Production Materials Technology Improvement Hall, we further realized the importance of the cooperative and mutual assistance path that you have instructed us to take. In the past, we only thought that organizing could save labor and produce more grain, but we did not realize that organizing could use machines. Now we deeply realize that "without mutual assistance, tractors and new agricultural implements cannot be used." The capital of each household is small, so they cannot afford machines, and the land is scattered, so it cannot be used either. Therefore, when we go back, we must mobilize everyone to organize mutual assistance and cooperation, consolidate and develop mutual aid teams, gradually move towards collectivization, use machine production, improve productivity, increase production income, enrich the motherland, and improve our lives.

In addition, after our visit, we learned that there are many things in our rural areas that are most needed by the city and can be exported in large quantities to exchange for machines. However, we knew little about these things in the past and did not pay attention to them, so they were all lost and damaged, such as pig bristles, chicken feathers, sheep intestines, etc. This greatly reduced the wealth of the country and our income. In the future, we must increase production, actively organize ourselves, transport them to the city, expand urban and rural material exchange, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. In addition, we have learned a lot of experience in organizing mutual assistance, overcoming disasters, improving technology, and striving for bumper harvests, which will not be reported one by one here.

Dear Chairman Mao, although we only visited for a few days, we learned a lot of things and solved many problems in our thinking and production. We are very happy and feel infinitely honored. In order to protect our lovely motherland, enhance the strength of the motherland to resist the United States and aid Korea, improve our lives, and repay the people of Tianjin for their meticulous reception, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and expand urban and rural material exchange, we must do the following:

1. Under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party, resolutely lead the masses and do our best to protect the great motherland. Whatever the motherland needs, we will give it. We will listen to the call of the motherland at any time and resolutely resist the United States and aid Korea to the end.

2. Resolutely implement the three major calls of the General Association for Resisting the United States and Aiding Korea, conscientiously promote patriotic conventions, complete increased production and donations, and ensure that the production and lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are the same as ours.

3. Facing the city and facing industry, carry out a patriotic production competition movement, increase the production of cotton and grain, and supply the city and industry with grain and raw materials. And challenge Qu Yaoli, a nationally famous cotton planting expert, to carry out a patriotic cotton sales competition, sell all the good cotton to the state in a timely manner, so as to closely connect urban and rural relations, expand material exchange, and develop industrial and agricultural production.

4. Develop, consolidate, and improve mutual aid teams, develop towards economically cooperative mutual aid teams, and learn from the Li Shunda mutual aid team.

5. Resolutely publicize the spirit of the conference in depth to every household, and encourage everyone to turn what they have learned at the conference into practical actions.

Dear Chairman Mao, we guarantee to achieve the above points.

Finally, we shout: Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Communist Party of China! May dear Chairman Mao be in good health! Long live Chairman Mao!

    山西运城专区参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会农民代表
    向毛主席报告参观后的思想变化
    认识了工人阶级的伟大领导作用，愿努力生产巩固工农联盟亲爱的毛主席：
    我们以十分兴奋的心情，向您报告我们山西省运城专区三百零七个代表，这次到天津市参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会的情形。
    我们于十月四日到达天津市，在天津共参观了七天。从家里起身到天津，我们到处受到工人老大哥和城市人民的热烈欢迎与招待。我们在路上坐的是专车，到天津住的是很舒适的地方，工人兄弟亲热耐心地告诉给我们城市生活的常识。上街时，他们给我们作向导，使我们不懂城市生活常识的人，感到非常的方便，没有一点异乡的感觉，解除了我们来城市的顾虑。我们农民代表到处受到尊敬，购买东西均享受折价优待。梅兰芳先生为我们也专门出演，我们受到从所未有的热烈欢迎、招待和尊敬。我们感到无上的光荣。我们思想上残存的对城市的旧认识，由此一扫而光。过去我们农民到城市，是受反动统治阶级的卑视、敌视与压迫的。他们捉弄我们，所以造成我们对城市的厌恶，只要有一点办法，我们是不愿进城的。我们城乡人民因为国民党的反动统治，被隔离开了。但是经过这次参观，我们深刻认识到，在您的领导下，在我们新民主主义社会制度中，城乡人民亲密团结起来了，城乡互助起来了，隔离现象已不存在。我们深深感到，劳动人民的地位是大大提高了，劳动人民真有无上的光荣。但是我们这种光荣与幸福，是在您和共产党领导下才得到的。如果没有您和共产党的正确领导，是万万不可能的。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们还要告诉您，我们参观了展览会，参观了天津市，我们的眼界扩大了。我们亲眼看到祖国丰富的资源和出产的各种宝贵的物品，以及我们祖国的伟大城市，更使我们感到祖国的伟大与可爱。我们都住在分散的落后的农村，没进过大城市，没见过电车，更没看到过我们祖国各地这么多的出产，没亲自看过祖国先进的工业建设。这次，在天津市，在展览馆中，以上所说的各种东西，我们大部分见到了。我们还坐了电车、电梯，这一切，都给我们思想上开辟了一条新的道路，使我们看到了未来新社会的远景。过去，常听说社会主义、共产主义社会的美丽与幸福，但我们还领会得不深刻，这次参观后，我们完全相信，将来我们的广大农村是完全可以向着近代化、工业化的方向发展的，是完全可以实现我们理想的社会的。过去我们认为有了一条牛就觉着了不起了，现在我们看了工人老大哥创造的机器，见到了近代化城市的伟大，感到我们的努力还太小，还要好好提高生产才行。只要我们城乡人民，特别是我们工农弟兄团结努力，加强生产，巩固国防，巩固人民民主专政，更美好的理想的社会，很快就可以达到。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们看到这样伟大可爱的祖国，看到我们农村的远景，我们怎能不高兴呢？我们怎能不保护她呢？我们怎能不积极努力生产，提起心劲，加速建设她呢？亲爱的毛主席，我们誓为保卫祖国的一切而奋斗，尽全力建设。
    我们过去也听说过工人阶级的伟大，只有工人阶级才能领导我们翻身，才能领导我们建设新的社会，走向社会主义社会。经过这次参观，我们更认识到工人阶级力量的伟大。我们有的代表说：“世界上再没有比工人阶级能创造新的东西了，我们只有在工人阶级领导下，才能使用上机器，走向近代化、工业化，走向幸福的社会。”这句话，我们全体代表都同意。为什么呢？就拿我们看到的机器来说：天津市工人老大哥今年制造出国产第一部新式汽车；太原市工人造出拖拉机；天津市工人发明引擎试验台，一年可省六万斤粮食；发明了一次能出两张纸的造纸机，增产百分之七十；制造了农业上使用的机器，比我们人力手工快好多倍。从我们来时坐火车来说：近两千里路程，两天多时间就到了，如果步行，就得一个来月。再如天津市的伟大城市建设，如果没有工人兄弟，我们农民是办不到的。他们不仅增加了生产，支援了农业，发挥了我们中国人民独立自主的精神，而且给帝国主义的封锁一个很大的打击。所以我们要好好生产，供给工人老大哥粮食和原料，让工人老大哥多多制造机器，供给我们使用，提高农业生产。否则，我们离开工人老大哥的领导是不能前进的，是不能提高与改进我们的农业生产的。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们参观了重工业和农业生产资料技术改进馆后，更进一步认识到您所指教我们走合作互助道路的重要性。以前我们对组织起来只认为能省工，多打粮食，没认识到组织起来能用机器。现在我们深刻认识到：“不互助起来，拖拉机和新式农具就用不成。”一家一户的资本小，就用不起机器，土地分散，也不能用。所以，我们回去要发动大家，都组织互助合作，巩固与发展互助组，逐步走向集体化，使用机器生产，提高生产力，增加生产收入，富裕祖国，改善我们的生活。
    另外，我们参观以后，知道我们农村有许多东西是城市最需要的，是可以大量出口换机器的。但是，我们过去知道得少，对这些东西都不重视，因而都丢损了，如猪鬃、鸡毛、羊肠等等。这样就大大减少国家的财富和我们的收入。今后我们要增加生产，主动组织起来，输送入城市，扩大城乡物资交流，巩固工农联盟。此外，在组织互助，战胜灾害，改进技术，争取丰产上，都学习了很多经验，这里不一一报告了。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们这次虽然只参观了数天，但我们学习了许多东西，解决了我们思想上、生产上许多问题，我们非常的高兴，我们感到无上的光荣。我们为了保护可爱的祖国，增强祖国抗美援朝的力量，改善我们的生活，并报答天津市人民对我们无微不至的招待，巩固工农联盟，扩大城乡物资交流，我们要作到如下几点：
    一、在您和共产党的领导下，坚决带领群众，尽全力保护伟大的祖国。祖国需要什么，我们给什么，随时听从祖国的召唤，坚决抗美援朝到底。
    二、坚决贯彻抗美援朝总会三大号召，认真推行爱国公约，完成增产捐献，保证烈军属生产、生活和我们一样。
    三、面向城市，面向工业，开展爱国主义的丰产竞赛运动，增产棉花粮食，供给城市和工业以粮食和原料。并向全国著名的植棉能手曲耀离应战，开展爱国售棉竞赛，把好棉全部及时卖给国家，以密切城乡关系，扩大物资交流，发展工农业生产。
    四、发展巩固与提高互助组，向经济上合作的互助组发展，向李顺达互助组学习。
    五、坚决把大会的精神，深入宣传到家喻户晓，推动大家把在大会上学习到的东西，变为实际行动。
    亲爱的毛主席，以上各点，我们保证实现。
    最后我们高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党万岁！亲爱的毛主席身体健康！毛主席万万岁！
