Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

    We sincerely accept the criticisms made by Xu Zhuoran and Cui Jinghua in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 27th regarding our work. The main reason for the various errors in the tunnel kiln and dormitory projects is indeed due to problems in the thinking of the leading cadres of the company and the factory. At the beginning when problems were discovered in the tunnel kiln project, the administrative leaders of the company and the factory both believed that these projects were carried out under insufficient technical and cadre conditions, coupled with other objective difficulties, making it difficult to achieve perfection. This erroneous view still existed during the first inspection. Later, following the spirit of the instructions from the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry, we continuously inspected the problems existing in the basic construction work over the past six months. The leading cadres of the company and the factory thoroughly and seriously examined themselves ideologically, recognizing that the main reasons for the errors were: the company's leading cadres adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the kiln factory's basic construction work, failing to grasp the three-level division of labor system; emphasizing the immediate completion of tasks, emphasizing cost-saving measures, and accommodating immediate difficulties, without considering long-term interests. Therefore, in basic construction work, they did not organize forces to inspect at any time; and they did not give appropriate education and timely criticism to the few cadres who lacked a sense of responsibility for the people's cause.

    Through this inspection, the leading cadres and all employees of the company and the factory have realized that basic construction is a major national economic construction task and also a major political task. Therefore, they have taken a step forward in thinking and practice; and have established the direction of future efforts:

    (1) The company and the factory will clearly divide the work, establish a project responsibility system, and improve the specialized management organization.

    (2) Construction will only begin after the planning and design work is completed; and the principle of steady progress will be strictly followed in carrying out the work.

    (3) The instructions on the planned separation of basic construction funds and operating funds will be implemented, and the financial work of production and basic construction will be truly separated.

    (4) The supervision system will be improved, and inspections will be carried out strictly at all times. Problems will be promptly resolved or corrected when discovered.

### 山西省建筑公司及窑业总厂对轮窑等工程错误的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    山西省建筑公司及窑业总厂对轮窑等工程错误的检讨编辑同志：
    八月二十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载徐卓然、崔景华对我们提出的批评，我们诚恳接受。造成轮窑及宿舍工程上各种错误的主要原因，确是由于公司和厂的领导干部在思想上存在着问题。在轮窑工程发现问题之初，公司和厂的行政领导干部，都认为这些工程是在技术条件和干部条件都不够的情况下进行的，再加上其他客观困难，自难作到尽善尽美。这种错误观点，在第一次检查时仍然存在着。后来遵照山西省工业厅指示的精神，连续检查了半年来基本建设工作中存在的问题。公司和厂的领导干部，从思想上彻底认真地作了检查，认识了造成错误的主要原因是：公司领导干部对窑厂基本建设工作采取了不负责任的态度，没有掌握三级分工制度；强调即时完成任务，强调省钱办事，迁就眼前困难，不从长远利益上打算。因此，在基本建设工作中没有组织力量随时检查；对少数对人民事业缺乏责任心的干部，没有给予适当的教育与及时的批评。
    经过这次检查，公司和厂的领导干部以及全体职工都认识了基本建设是国家重大的经济建设工作，也是重大的政治任务，因而在思想上与做法上都提高一步；并确立了今后努力的方向是：
    （一）公司与厂明确分工，建立工程专责制度，健全专管机构。
    （二）做好计划与设计工作后再开工；并绝对遵照稳步前进的方针进行工作。
    （三）执行基本建设基金与经营资金会计划分的指示，把生产与基本建设财务工作确实分清。
    （四）健全监工制度，并随时严格检查，发现问题速予解决或纠正。
    山西省建筑公司兼经理  王正平  窑业总厂厂长  焦红
