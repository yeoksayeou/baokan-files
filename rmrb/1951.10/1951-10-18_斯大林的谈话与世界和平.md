    Stalin's talk with a Pravda reporter on the issue of atomic weapons is undoubtedly a head-on blow to the American atomic warmongers. Peace-loving people all over the world warmly welcome and support this righteous message of peace from humanity's teacher, and warmly celebrate the discovery of the secrets of atomic energy by outstanding Soviet scientists under the leadership of the great Stalin. The fact that the Soviet Union has mastered atomic energy, and the decision to conduct atomic bomb tests of various diameters, have completely bankrupted the American atomic bandit's policy of atomic monopoly. Therefore, the cause of world peace has been further guaranteed.
    The theoretical foundation of atomic energy is the law of mass-energy equivalence, which is one of the corollaries of the special theory of relativity. Relativity is the crystallization of the development of mechanics, optics, and electrodynamics. Since the publication of the special theory of relativity in 1906, physics has progressed from the study of atoms to the study of the atomic nucleus; natural radioactivity has developed into artificial radioactivity. Many outstanding physicists and chemists—including the peace fighters Joliot-Curie and his wife—have made epoch-making contributions. The utilization of atomic energy shows that mankind's mastery of energy in nature has deepened from mechanical energy, chemical energy, and electrical energy to the energy inside the atom. It is a brilliant achievement of scientists after forty years of struggle with nature.
    The discovery and application of atomic energy has presented a new historical lesson to scientists in capitalist countries, namely: scientists must resolutely adhere to the purpose of serving the people, otherwise, if they sell their knowledge and technology as commodities, they will certainly be exploited by imperialist ambitionists, and make themselves accomplices in imperialist plunder of the people of other countries and destruction of world peace. Scientists who are currently participating in the manufacture of atomic bombs or other deadly weapons in the United States have fallen into such a tragic fate. Especially physicists and chemists from continental Europe who suffered cruel persecution under the Nazis before and during World War II, they fled to the United States with the illusion of pursuing freedom and democracy, and participated in the work of experimenting with atomic energy and manufacturing atomic bombs. But unfortunately, their scientific work was used by Wall Street bosses as a tool for international blackmail. When the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China and Japanese imperialism was on the verge of collapse, the United States used two atomic bombs to slaughter many peaceful residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in order to steal the fruits of the Chinese people's protracted war of resistance and the Soviet army's victory over the Kwantung Army that led to Japan's surrender. After the victorious end of World War II, the United States has attempted to threaten the people of the world with atomic bombs more than once. Peace-loving scientists all over the world should remember this painful lesson.
    Stalin's talk on the issue of atomic weapons seriously struck a blow to the American warmongers' policy of using atomic weapons to carry out blackmail and intimidation. Are atomic bombs scary? Stalin had already said in 1946 that atomic bombs can only be used to intimidate people with weak nerves. When the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea last year and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, defeating the American invading army in the first battle, the warmonger Truman attempted to scare the Chinese and Korean people with atomic bombs, but it was not us who were scared, but the imperialist bloc itself.
    The Soviet Union has always advocated using atomic energy to improve the happiness of human life, resolutely opposed the use of atomic weapons, and strongly advocated banning the use of atomic weapons and stopping the production of atomic weapons. These just proposals have been rejected by the American and British imperialist blocs. This shows the intention of the American warmongers to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries with atomic bombs at all costs. Because of this situation, the Soviet Union had to manufacture atomic weapons to defend peace and the security of socialist countries. Therefore, the Soviet Union's mastery and production of atomic weapons is another major contribution to world peace.
    Peace cannot wait, it must be fought for. The Soviet Union's experimentation with and production of atomic weapons is another major step forward in the practical action of striving for world peace. This fact proves that: the Soviet Union's science and technology have reached a high level of development and have unlimited brilliant prospects; and only in socialist countries can all scientific achievements serve the happiness of mankind and the cause of peace. The Soviet scientific warriors have completed the glorious task of mastering the secrets of the atomic bomb, which has greatly encouraged peace-loving scientists all over the world, and enhanced their understanding and confidence in defending world peace.
    The Soviet Union's manufacture of atomic weapons is only one link in the Soviet people's struggle to defend world peace—an important link, of course. At the same time, under the leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet people are also carrying out various great construction plans, and the successful completion of these plans will directly strengthen the strength of socialist countries, which is equally important for defending the cause of world peace. The Soviet Union is now experimenting with and manufacturing atomic weapons, which is only a part of the plan to utilize atomic energy, and its main application is in opening mountains and building roads, turning deserts into fertile fields, and transforming nature for the benefit of the people's lives, so as to enable socialist society to quickly enter a better communist society. Undoubtedly, atomic energy will play a huge role in this stage of social development.
    Stalin's talk on the issue of atomic weapons greatly inspired the confidence of the people of the world in the struggle to defend peace, especially making the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the front lines of the War to Resist America and Aid Korea feel infinitely excited, which is in stark contrast to the disillusionment and sadness of the American warmongers' aggressive delusions. At the same time, it enlightened Chinese scientists with a great truth, that is: scientific work must first serve to strengthen national defense construction and develop the country's industrial and agricultural productivity, so as to ensure the security of the motherland and the construction of a new democratic society. The great achievements of Soviet scientists are our glorious example. Chinese scientists, follow the path indicated by Stalin and strive forward!
    The collapse of imperialism is not far off, let the peace-loving people of the world unite and intensify the struggle to accelerate the arrival of our final victory!

    斯大林的谈话与世界和平
    中国物理学会理事长清华大学物理系教授  周培源
    斯大林关于原子武器问题答真理报记者的谈话，毫无疑问是对美国原子黩武主义者的当头一棒。全世界爱好和平的人们，热烈欢迎和拥护人类导师这一义正词严的和平福音，并热烈地庆贺优秀的苏联科学家在伟大的斯大林领导下，发现了原子能的秘密。苏联已经掌握了原子能的事实，和将要进行各种不同直径原子弹试验的决定，已使美国原子强盗的原子垄断政策彻底破产。因此，世界和平事业就进一步地得到了保证。
    原子能的理论基础是质量与能量等值的定律，这是狭义相对论推论之一。相对论是力学、光学和电动力学发展的结晶品。自一九○六年狭义相对论发表之后，物理学自原子的研究进入原子核的研究；自然放射发展到人工放射学。许多位优秀的物理学和化学工作者——其中有和平战士约里奥—居里夫妇——做了划时代的贡献。原子能的被利用，说明了人类对于自然界能量的掌握已自机械能、化学能和电能深入到原子内部的能。它是科学工作者经过四十年与自然界斗争的辉煌成果。
    原子能的发现和应用，对于资本主义各国的科学工作者提出了一个新的历史教训，那就是：科学工作者必须坚决抱定为人民服务的宗旨，否则如以自己的知识和技术当作商品出售，就一定会被帝国主义野心家所利用，使自己成为帝国主义掠夺其他国家人民、破坏世界和平的帮凶。正在美国参加原子弹或其他杀人凶器制造工作的科学工作者们，就陷入了这样的悲惨命运。尤其是在第二次世界大战以前以及大战期中，受过纳粹惨酷迫害的欧洲大陆上的物理学家和化学家，他们抱了追求自由和民主的幻想而逃到美国，参加了试验原子能和制造原子弹的工作。但是他们的科学工作不幸被华尔街的老板利用来作为实行国际敲诈的工具。在苏联出兵东北，日本帝国主义行将崩溃的时候，美国用两个原子弹屠杀了日本广岛和长崎的许多和平居民，以窃夺中国人民持久抗战和苏联军队击溃关东军所获致的日本投降的胜利果实。在第二次世界大战胜利结束以后，美国不止一次企图以原子弹威胁世界人民。全世界爱好和平的科学工作者应当记着这个惨痛的教训。
    斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话，严重地打击了美国黩武主义者利用原子武器实行讹诈和恫吓的政策。原子弹可怕吗？斯大林在一九四六年就已经说过，原子弹只能用来威吓神经脆弱的人。当去年中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战第一仗打败了美国侵略军之后，战争贩子杜鲁门即曾企图以原子弹来吓唬中朝人民，但被吓倒的不是我们，而是帝国主义自己的集团。
    苏联向来主张以原子能用来增进人类生活的幸福，坚决反对使用原子武器，而且极力主张禁止使用原子武器、停止原子武器的生产。这种正义的主张，都被美英帝国主义集团所拒绝。这表示了美国黩武主义者不惜用原子弹来进攻苏联和人民民主国家的意图。由于这种情况，苏联不得不制造原子武器，来保卫和平与社会主义国家的安全。因此，苏联之掌握与生产原子武器对于世界和平是又一重大贡献。
    和平不能等待，必须争取。苏联实验与生产原子武器，是在争取世界和平的实际行动中，又向前迈进了一大步。这一事实证明了：苏联的科学技术已有了高度的发展和无限辉煌的前途；并且只有在社会主义国家中，一切科学成果才能为人类的幸福与和平事业而服务。苏联的科学战士们完成了掌握原子弹秘密的光荣任务，使世界爱好和平的科学工作者们获得了极大的鼓舞，并提高了他们对保卫世界和平的认识与信心。
    苏联关于原子武器的制造，只不过是苏联人民保卫世界和平斗争的一环——当然是重要的一环。同时，苏联人民在伟大的斯大林的领导下，还进行着各项伟大的建设计划，这些计划的顺利完成，也就直接增强了社会主义国家的力量，对于保卫世界和平事业有着同样重要的作用。苏联现在试验和制造原子武器，只是利用原子能计划中的一部分，其主要的应用是在开山修路、变沙漠为良田、改造大自然为人民谋生活上的幸福，以便使社会主义社会迅速进入更好的共产主义社会。无疑的，原子能将在这一段社会发展过程中起极大的作用。
    斯大林关于原子武器问题的谈话，极大的鼓舞了世界人民保卫和平斗争的信心，尤其将使抗美战争前线的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的战士们，感到无限的兴奋，这与美国黩武主义者侵略妄想的幻灭和悲哀，恰成一个鲜明的对比。同时对于中国的科学工作者更启示了一个伟大的真理，那就是：科学工作首先必须为加强国防建设与发展国家工农业的生产力而服务，以保证祖国的安全与新民主主义社会的建设。苏联科学工作者的伟大成就，就是我们光辉的榜样。中国的科学工作者遵循着斯大林指示的道路努力前进吧！
    帝国主义的溃亡已经为期不远了，全世界爱好和平的人们团结起来，加紧斗争，以加速我们最后胜利的到来！
