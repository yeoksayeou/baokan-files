　　Last October, our regiment crossed the Yalu River, tasked with blocking the enemy in the Unsan-Tongdong-ri line. The battle started on the 27th, and the enemy charged a dozen or twenty times a day, but we pushed them all back. On the third night, two vanguard platoons of the 3rd Company were surrounded by the enemy. At that time, I was a bugler in the battalion. I was the only one familiar with the route to the vanguard platoons, as I had accompanied the battalion commander to survey the terrain. I volunteered to take on the mission of contacting the 3rd Company. As soon as it got dark, I set off with a squad, crossed two hilltops, and discovered two enemy sentries monitoring the road on the hillside ahead. I immediately ordered the second group to sneak into the encirclement from the ditch beside the road, while I led the first group into the encirclement from the sentry line. I made contact with the 3rd Company commander and safely led the 3rd Company out of the encirclement. After this battle, I was assigned to the 1st Company as the deputy of the 3rd Platoon. I was very happy because I could directly fight the American devils on the battlefield!

　　In February of this year, our division surrounded the enemy in Heugok-ri, north of Hoengseong. I led the 8th Squad to occupy a small hill beside the highway. Suddenly, I noticed two American devils peeking out of a small house beside the road. At this time, I ordered the machine gun to provide cover and block the back door. At the same time, I led the third group to rush over and block the front door. I looked into the house and it was full of devils. I pointed my gun at them, and they all raised their hands and surrendered. I checked, and there were twenty-six in total. On the way back with the prisoners, I captured another seven American devils. In this battle, our entire division captured two or three thousand American devils.

　　Since our army took the initiative to withdraw from Seoul, we have been fighting a blocking battle on the south bank of the Han River. At this time, I had been promoted to platoon leader of the 1st Platoon of the 1st Company. On the third day, the battle of Cheongpyeongcheon broke out. I led the 1st Squad to guard the mountain beside the highway from Seoul to Chuncheon. The enemy set up ten large cannons on the highway, firing from dawn to dusk, from the top of the mountain to the foot. More than a dozen airplanes took turns strafing and bombing, but we concealed ourselves in the fortifications without firing a single shot, waiting for their infantry to come up. After the enemy shelled for a while, the infantry did indeed come up. We calmly waited until they reached the middle of the mountain, and I shouted, “Fire!” Our grenades, machine guns, and automatic rifles all fired at once, immediately driving the enemy back. The enemy suffered at our hands, and the shells and bombs came again. We fought the enemy until 3:00 p.m. Seeing that they couldn't break through, the enemy went to attack the 7th and 8th Squads. I immediately ordered the comrades of the 1st Squad to concentrate on the positions of the 7th and 8th Squads. The enemy charged up in three directions. When the enemy was forty or fifty meters away from our position, I shouted: "In order to defend the motherland, in order to defend Chairman Mao, we must resolutely beat back the enemy!" Everyone shouted, "Fight!" Then a burst of grenades exploded in the enemy's nest. We beat back the enemy's most fierce counterattack and completed the blocking mission.

　　Because I had resolutely completed the tasks given to me by the higher authorities in several battles, everyone awarded me a First-Class Merit.

    胜利地完成了战斗任务
    人民志愿军战斗英雄  刘文华
    去年十月我们团跨过了鸭绿江，任务是在云山——通洞里一线阻击敌人。二十七日战斗打响了，敌人一天冲锋一二十次，都被我们打了回去。在第三天晚上，三连的两个前卫排被敌人包围了。这时我在营里当号目。到前卫排去的一条路只有我熟悉，因为我曾陪营长去看过地形，我就自告奋勇接受了联络三连的任务。天刚黑，我带着一个班出发了，摸过两个山头，发现前面有敌人的两个哨兵在山坡上监视这条路；我马上叫二组从路旁的水沟里摸进包围圈里，我带着一组也从哨兵线进入包围圈。我和三连长取得了联系，就稳稳当当地把三连带出了包围圈。这次战斗后，我被派到第一连当三排副，我很高兴，因为我能在战场上直接打美国鬼子了！
    今年二月，我们师在横城北面鹤谷里包围了敌人。我带领八班占领了公路旁的一个小山，忽然发现路旁小屋里有两个美国鬼子探头探脑。这时我一面命令用机枪掩护并封住后门，一面带着三组冲过去封住前门，我往屋里一看，黑鸦鸦地全是鬼子，我用枪一比划，他们都举起手来当了俘虏。我一查，一共二十六个。在押着俘虏回去的路上，我又俘掳了七个美国鬼子。在这次战斗中，我们全师一共俘掳了两三千个美国鬼子。
    我军自从主动撤出汉城后，就在汉江南岸打阻击战。这时我已升任一连一排排长。第三天清平川的战斗打响了，我带着一班守在由汉城去春川的公路旁的山上，敌人在公路上摆了十门大炮，从天亮打到天黑，从山顶打到山脚，还有十几架飞机轮流扫射、投弹，我们却隐蔽在工事里不放一枪，只等他们的步兵上来。敌人打了一阵后，步兵果然上来了。我们沉着气，等他们走到山腰，我喊了一声
    “打！”我们的手榴弹、机枪、自动步枪一齐开火，
    一下子就把敌人打退了。敌人吃了我们的亏，炮弹、炸弹又来了。我们和敌人一直打到下午三点钟，敌人看打不动我们，又去打七、八班，我马上命令
    一班同志集中到七、八班的阵地上，敌人分三路冲上来了，等敌人离我们阵地四、五十公尺时，我喊道：“为了保卫祖国，为了保卫毛主席，我们要坚决把敌人打下去！”大家都喊：“打呀！”接着一阵手榴弹在敌人窝里开了花。我们把敌人最凶的一次反击也打下去了，完成了阻击的任务。
    由于在几次战斗中，我都坚决完成了上级给我的任务，大家给我评了一等功。
