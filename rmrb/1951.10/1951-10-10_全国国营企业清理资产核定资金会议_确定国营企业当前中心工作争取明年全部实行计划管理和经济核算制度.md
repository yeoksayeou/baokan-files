    全国国营企业清理资产核定资金会议
    确定国营企业当前中心工作
    争取明年全部实行计划管理和经济核算制度
     【新华社九日讯】第一次全国国营企业清理资产核定资金会议，于八月十七日至三十日在北京举行。这次会议讨论了清理资产核定资金的方针、任务、条例和办法，并组织了表报、估价、会计三个小组，修正了表报草案，订出了若干价格标准，拟出了清理资产核定资金使用的暂编统一会计科目。
    这次全国国营企业清理资产核定资金的目的是促进国营企业建立与提高计划管理，并逐步实行经济核算制。会议明确规定全国国营企业从本年九月至十二月应以编制明年计划和进行清理资产核定资金为中心工作。这样，全国国营企业即有可能在明年实行计划管理和经济核算制度。会议规定地方公营企业亦应清理资产和核定资金。至于是否在今年和国营企业同时进行，可由各大行政区根据当地具体条件自行决定。
    会议规定国营企业在核定资金以后，各企业单位必须实行独立会计制，并和银行建立结算（划拨清算）制度，以便能使国家银行透过信贷、结算和货币管理，对企业进行资金监督，促进企业积极发掘后备力量，加速资金周转。
    会议对于清理资产核定资金工作中的估价标准、企业原材料和产品的储存等问题，都作了规定。
