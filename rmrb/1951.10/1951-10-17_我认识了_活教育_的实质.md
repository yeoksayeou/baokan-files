Reader's Letter

    I Recognized the Essence of "Living Education"
    To the Editor:
    Chen Heqin's article "My Preliminary Review of 'Living Education'," published on page three of the People's Daily on October 8th, is a good inspiration for education workers with reformist ideas. I also learned from this article.
    When I was studying in schools in the old society, I felt indignant at the darkness and corruption of the old society, but I couldn't figure out the direction and couldn't find the goal of struggle. When I discovered the magazine "Living Education," I was tempted by its theories. I was fascinated by the so-called "living" education of "learning by doing, teaching by doing, and seeking progress by doing" and "turning barren mountains into paradises." I thought that only in this way could one be considered "detached" or "noble"; and only in this way could one truly achieve the fundamental path of "saving the country and the people." Therefore, I became a loyal reader of "Living Education."
    Due to limitations in my political level, I lacked the ability to analyze and judge. For the two years after liberation, I still believed that the theory of "Living Education" advocated by Mr. Chen Heqin was progressive and did not violate our new democratic educational thought. After reading Mr. Chen Heqin's preliminary review of "Living Education," I realized that I had been poisoned by the "reformist" thought that was nominally "super-class" and "super-political" but actually served the reactionaries. In the future, I must study hard and learn to use the scientific ideological method of Marxism-Leninism to correctly identify all problems.

### 我认识了“活教育”的实质

    我认识了“活教育”的实质编辑同志：
    十月八日人民日报三版发表的陈鹤琴先生的“我对‘活教育’的初步检讨”一文，对于有改良主义思想的教育工作者是一个很好的启发。我也从这篇文章中受到了教育。
    我在旧社会的学校中求学的时候，对旧社会的黑暗腐败，感到愤懑，但是我摸不清方向，找不到斗争的目标；当我发现了“活教育”这本杂志时，我为它的理论所诱惑，我醉心于“做中学，做中教，做中求进步”以及“变荒山为乐园”的所谓“活”的教育。我认为只有这样，才能称得起“超然”或
    “清高”；也只有这样，才是“救国救民”的根本道路。因此，我成了“活教育”的忠实读者。
    由于政治水平的限制，我缺乏分析判断的能力；解放两年来，我还一直认为陈鹤琴先生所创导的“活教育”的理论是进步的，与我们新民主主义的教育思想并不违背；读过陈鹤琴先生对“活教育”的初步检讨后，我才知道我中了名为“超阶级”“超政治”而实际是为反动派服务的“改良主义”的思想毒害。今后我一定要很好地学习，学习用马列主义的科学的思想方法，正确地来识别一切问题。
