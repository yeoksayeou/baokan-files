The attendees on the United Nations Command delegation were Vice Admiral Joy, Chief Delegate, and Major Generals Craigie, Hoge, Bolte, and Lee Hyung-geun. At the delegation meeting in the morning, our Chief Delegate General Nam Il suggested that, in order to ensure that both sides strictly abide by the agreement on safety arrangements in the meeting area that has been approved by both sides, and to prevent the armistice negotiations from being hindered by incidents of violation of the agreement, a joint liaison office of liaison officers from both sides should be established to be responsible for determining the details of the safety arrangements, inspecting the implementation of the agreement by both sides, investigating incidents of violation of the agreement, and handling common administrative matters of both sides. The United Nations Command delegation agreed to our suggestion. The meeting then moved on to a discussion of how to proceed with the second agenda item. In order to accelerate the armistice negotiations, both sides agreed that the subcommittee should continue discussions to determine the military demarcation line in order to establish a demilitarized zone. The meeting of the two delegations ended at 11:53 AM. At 2:00 PM on the 25th, the subcommittee began to continue discussions on determining the military demarcation line in order to establish a demilitarized zone.
