Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 23rd: The Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea on October 25, 1950, and, together with the Korean People's Army, have been engaging in heroic and resourceful combat against the American aggressor army and its accomplice forces. Over the past year, the Korean-Chinese People's Army has conducted five large-scale victorious campaigns: The First Campaign, which began on October 25 and ended on November 5, 1950, crushed MacArthur's so-called "end the Korean War before Thanksgiving" offensive in the Wenjing and Yunshan areas, driving the invading army, which had approached the border of Northeast China, south of the Cheongcheon River. The Second Campaign, which began on November 25 and ended on December 10, thoroughly smashed MacArthur's so-called "final end to the Korean War" total offensive. In this campaign, the invading army completely collapsed and fled southward in panic. Our army liberated the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pyongyang, in one fell swoop. The invading army on the eastern front, which had occupied Chongjin, Hamhung, and other places, also fled by sea after suffering heavy blows, resulting in "the biggest defeat in the history of the US Army." On New Year's Eve of the same year, the Korean-Chinese People's Army launched a powerful New Year Offensive, breaking through the enemy's strong defenses along the 38th parallel, liberating Seoul again, and pushing all the way to the south bank of the Han River. The Fourth Campaign, which began on January 25 and ended on March 14, 1951, saw our army conduct 49 days of heroic blocking actions on both banks of the Han River, and launch a powerful counterattack in the Hengseong area in the eastern section of the Han River, eliminating a large number of enemy troops. For about a month thereafter, the enemy temporarily pushed the battle line northward by several miles at the cost of a large number of casualties, re-occupying Seoul, which had been voluntarily evacuated by our army, and attempting to advance into the waist of Korea - the Wonsan-Anju line. Thereupon our army launched the Fifth Campaign, and within 30 days from April 22 to May 21, continuously carried out several annihilating counterattacks, with countless "dagger" units penetrating into the heart of the enemy, dividing and encircling them, eliminating a large number of enemy troops, and driving the enemy back 50 to 70 kilometers. On May 22, our army voluntarily transferred to favorable areas north of the 38th parallel to continue annihilating the enemy.

These five large-scale victorious campaigns have inflicted huge losses on the invading army's manpower, forcing US imperialism to accept the proposal for Korean armistice negotiations in July. However, US imperialism continues to undermine and delay the Korean armistice negotiations, while the invading army continues to launch frantic offensives. The Korean-Chinese People's Army stands ready and has crushed Van Fleet's so-called "Summer Offensive," inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. At present, the Korean-Chinese People's Army is continuing to crush Van Fleet's so-called "Autumn Offensive," striving for new and greater victories.

Over the past year, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have achieved major victories, eliminating a large number of enemy troops, recovering vast territories in northern Korea, and laying a solid foundation for final victory. The following is a summary of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' achievements in the past year (from October 25, 1950, to October 10, 1951):

(1) Eliminated more than 387,000 enemy troops, including 176,655 American aggressor troops killed, wounded, or captured, 198,324 Rhee Syngman puppet troops, 9,487 British and Australian troops, and 2,682 accomplice troops from France, Canada, Turkey, the Philippines, and other countries (the number of accomplice troops from the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries eliminated is not included in the statistics).

(2) Captured 10 enemy aircraft, 50 armored vehicles, 189 tanks, 5,378 various vehicles, 3,489 various guns (including 423 howitzers, 338 recoilless rifles, 7 field guns, 43 mountain guns, 56 chemical mortars, and 2,622 other various caliber guns such as mortars and automatic cannons), 60,197 various guns (including 4,282 light and heavy machine guns, 186 anti-aircraft machine guns, and 55,729 automatic rifles, carbines, submachine guns, rifles, etc.), more than 100,740 shells of various types, more than 5,009,180 bullets of various types, 11,966 hand grenades, and countless other military supplies.

(3) Shot down or damaged 2,300 enemy fighter planes, bombers, reconnaissance planes, etc., including 1,654 shot down and 646 damaged. If the 10 enemy aircraft captured in item (2) are added, the total is 2,310.

(4) Destroyed 756 enemy tanks, 1,906 various vehicles, 31 armored vehicles, 69 various guns, and 4 cranes.

The fighting over the past year shows that the losses in manpower and combat equipment of the American and British group invading army and the Rhee Syngman traitorous army are very large. It also shows that the Korean-Chinese People's Forces have achieved such significant victories in the past without aircraft, tanks, and only a small number of technical arms cooperating in combat. With the gradual construction and strengthening of technical arms, even greater victories will be achieved in the future.

    朝中人民军队并肩作战一年
    歼敌三十八万七千余名
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】中国人民志愿军于一九五零年十月二十五日进入朝鲜，与朝鲜人民军在一起，对美国侵略军及其帮凶军进行英勇机智的作战。一年以来，朝中人民军队进行了五次大规模的胜利战役：第一次战役自一九五零年十月二十五日开始到十一月五日结束，在温井、云山地区粉碎了麦克阿瑟所谓“感恩节前结束朝鲜战争”的攻势，把迫近中国东北边境的侵略军赶到了清川江以南。第二次战役自十一月二十五日开始到十二月十日结束，彻底打垮了麦克阿瑟再度叫嚣的所谓“最后结束朝鲜战争”的总攻势。是役侵略军全线崩溃，亡命南逃。我军一举收复了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都平壤。东部战线侵占清津、咸兴等地的侵略军也在遭到惨重的打击后，从海上逃走，造成了“美国陆军史上最大的败绩”。同年除夕，朝中人民军队发动了强大的新年攻势，突破三十八度线上的敌军强固防线，再度解放汉城，一直打到汉江南岸。第四次战役自一九五一年一月二十五日开始到三月十四日结束，我军在汉江两岸进行了四十九天英勇的阻击战，并在汉江东段横城地区举行了强大反击，消灭了大量敌军。此后约一个月时间内，敌军以大量有生力量被歼的代价，暂时将战线向北推移了若干里，再度侵占了为我军主动撤出的汉城，并妄图进窜朝鲜的蜂腰部——元山、安州一线，于是我军发起第五次战役，在四月二十二日至五月二十一日的三十天内，连续举行数次歼灭性的反击，以无数“尖刀”部队插入敌军心脏，分割围歼，消灭了大量敌军，逐退敌军五十到七十公里。五月二十二日，我军主动转移至三十八度线以北有利地区，继续歼敌。
    这五次大规模的胜利战役，使侵略军的有生力量遭到了巨大损失，因而美帝国主义不得不于七月间被迫接受朝鲜停战谈判的建议。但是美帝国主义不断破坏和拖延朝鲜停战谈判，同时，侵略军不断地疯狂进攻。朝中人民军队严阵以待，粉碎了范佛里特的所谓“夏季攻势”，使敌军遭受了惨重的损失。目前朝中人民军队在继续粉碎着范佛里特的所谓“秋季攻势”，争取新的更大胜利。
    一年来，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军取得了重大的胜利，消灭了大量敌军，收复了朝鲜北部的广大土地，并奠定了最后胜利的巩固基础。下面是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一年综合战绩（自一九五零年十月二十五日到一九五一年十月十日）：
    （一）消灭敌军三十八万七千余人，其中包括击毙、击伤、俘掳美国侵略军十七万六千六百五十五名，李伪军十九万八千三百二十四名，英国和澳大利亚军九千四百八十七名，法国、加拿大、土耳其、菲律宾等国帮凶军二千六百八十二名（荷兰、比利时等帮凶军被歼的数字未统计在内）。
    （二）缴获敌军飞机十架，装甲汽车五十辆，战车一百八十九辆，各种汽车五千三百七十八辆，各种炮三千四百八十九门（其中包括榴弹炮四百二十三门，无座力炮三百三十八门，野炮七门，山炮四十三门，化学迫击炮五十六门及迫击炮、自动炮等其他各种口径炮二千六百二十二门），各种枪六万零一百九十七枝（其中包括轻重机枪四千二百八十二挺，高射机枪一百八十六挺及自动步枪、卡宾枪、冲锋枪、步枪等五万五千七百二十九枝），各种炮弹十万零七千四百七十余发，各种子弹五百万零九千一百八十余发，手榴弹一万一千九百六十六枚及其他各种军用物资无数。
    （三）击落击伤敌军战斗机、轰炸机、侦察机等二千三百架，其中击落一千六百五十四架，击伤六百四十六架。若加上（二）项缴获的敌军飞机十架在内，共为二千三百一十架。
    （四）击毁敌军战车七百五十六辆，各种汽车一千九百零六辆，装甲汽车三十一辆，各种炮六十九门，起重车四辆。
    这一年来的战斗说明：美英集团侵略军和李承晚卖国军的有生力量和战斗器材的损失是很大的，同时也说明朝中人民部队既能在过去没有飞机战车、只有少数技术兵种配合作战的条件下，取得了如此重大的胜利，而在逐渐建设和加强技术兵种的条件下，今后必会取得更大的胜利。
