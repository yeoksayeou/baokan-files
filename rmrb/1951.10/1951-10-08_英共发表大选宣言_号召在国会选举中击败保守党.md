Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th dispatch from TASS: The British Communist Party's election manifesto has been published. The manifesto calls for the defeat of the Conservative Party in the upcoming parliamentary elections, to fight for a free, strong, and independent Britain, and advocates for peace and international cooperation, and an end to the Korean War.

The manifesto puts forward the Communist Party's policies: immediate negotiations to seek peace, no war preparations; British independence, no American control; social progress, no "wage restraints" and cuts in social services.

The manifesto reveals that both the Conservative and Labour Party leaders are advocating for the expansion of armaments, and points out that it is a small handful of wealthy Americans and Britons that are preventing agreements between major powers. The manifesto emphasizes that the plans of the aggressors can be stopped by the actions of the people. We demand that all people who want peace support the policies we put forward - concluding a five-power peace pact, ending the Korean War, accepting China's participation in the Security Council, strengthening the United Nations as a tool for peace, not rearming Germany and Japan, not engaging with Franco's Spain, banning atomic bombs and generally reducing armaments, stopping the Malayan War, allowing all colonial people to gain independence, and establishing new friendly relations with them.

The manifesto puts forward the Communist Party's policies on economic and social issues, the purpose of which is to raise the living standards of workers.

The manifesto calls for the abolition of American control over Britain's economy, politics, and military, the abolition of the American occupation of Britain, the abolition of the Atlantic War Pact, and the abolition of all restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries.

The manifesto emphasizes the evil consequences of the arms race for Britain, pointing out that if the Conservative Party wins, it will further intensify war preparations, engage in new military adventures, surrender more completely to American big business, worsen the situation of the working people, and attack their trade union rights. The manifesto calls on all people who want peace, independence, and social progress to unite and defeat the Conservative Party. The manifesto also points out that to defeat the Conservative Party, a positive and combative policy is needed, and the Labour Party's manifesto does not put forward such a policy. The Labour Party leaders' policies have helped the Conservative Party, and only by changing this policy through the struggle of the labor movement and the people can Britain be saved. The manifesto concludes by saying: Now, more than ever, there is a need for Communist Party members who are accountable to the people and who will lead the people to act for their demands to return to Parliament.

    英共发表大选宣言
    号召在国会选举中击败保守党
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英国共产党的大选宣言已经发表。宣言号召在即将举行的国会选举中击败保守党，为争取自由、强盛、独立的英国而斗争，并主张和平及国际合作，和结束朝鲜战争。
    宣言提出共产党的政策是：立即进行谈判谋求和平，不要进行战争准备；英国独立，不要美国的控制；社会进步，不要“工资约制”和削减社会服务。
    宣言揭露保守党和工党的领导人都鼓吹扩张军备，并指出，妨碍大国之间成立协议的就是美英的一小撮富翁。宣言强调说，侵略者计划是可以由人民的行动来制止的，我们要求全体要和平的人支持我们所提出的政策——缔结五大国和平公约，终止朝鲜战争，接受中国参加安全理事会，加强作为和平工具的联合国，不重新武装德国和日本，不与佛朗哥西班牙发生联系，禁止原子弹并普遍裁减军备，停止马来亚战争，让全体殖民地人民得到独立，并和他们建立新的友好关系。
    宣言提出共产党在经济和社会问题上的政策，这个政策的目的，在于提高工人的生活水平。
    宣言要求取消美国对英国经济、政治和军事方面的控制，取消美国对英国的占领，废除大西洋战争公约，同时取消与苏联、中国和人民民主国家贸易的一切限制。
    宣言强调军备运动对英国所造成的恶果，指出保守党如果胜利，就会更加加紧战争准备，从事新的军事冒险，更彻底地向美国大企业投降，恶化劳动人民的境况，并攻击他们的工会权利。宣言号召全体要和平、独立及社会进步的人联合起来，打败保守党。宣言同时指出：要打败保守党，需要有积极的战斗的政策，而工党的宣言并没有提出这样的政策，工党领导人的政策是帮助了保守党，唯有劳工运动和人民进行斗争，改变这种政策，才能挽救英国。宣言最后说：现在比任何时候更需要有对人民负责的、会领导人民为他们的要求而行动起来的共产党的议员返回国会。
