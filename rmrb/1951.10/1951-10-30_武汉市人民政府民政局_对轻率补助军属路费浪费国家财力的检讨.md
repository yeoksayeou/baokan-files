    Wuhan Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau
    Self-Criticism for Frivolously Subsidizing Military Dependents' Travel Expenses and Wasting State Funds

    The People's Daily published an article on August 17th written by reader Comrade Wei Min entitled "We Must Be Responsible for Military Dependents; 'Recklessly Issuing Introduction Letters' is Wrong." The article criticized our bureau's frivolous subsidization of military dependent Zhang Xuehong's travel expenses to Beijing. Our bureau has conducted an investigation.

    According to the self-criticism report of the person responsible for the matter: "When military dependent Zhang Xuehong, residing at Xiangdong Street, Xiangdong District, Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, came to our bureau to apply for travel expense subsidies, I only relied on her verbal explanation of the situation and failed to thoroughly examine whether she was going to Beijing to visit relatives or to find work in order to handle the matter appropriately. At the same time, due to my low level of professional competence, I not only failed to correct the irresponsible mistake of the Xiangdong Street People's Government of Xiangdong District, Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, in recklessly issuing introduction letters, but also subsidized military dependent Zhang Xuehong's travel expenses, resulting in her making a fruitless round trip and wasting state funds. These actions demonstrated my irresponsible attitude. In addition to making a profound self-criticism, I guarantee that in future work I will be responsible and strengthen my professional studies, and will never make similar mistakes again."

    This incident shows that bureaucratic work styles still exist in the leadership of our bureau. In the future, in addition to strengthening the professional training of cadres, we will also inspect our work at any time, so that similar mistakes will not be repeated.

    武汉市人民政府民政局
    对轻率补助军属路费浪费国家财力的检讨
    八月十七日人民日报登载读者魏民同志所写“对军属要认真负责任，‘乱开介绍信’是不对的”一文，对我局轻率补助过路军属张学鸿路费赴北京一事提出批评，我局已进行了检查。
    据该事承办人检讨报告称：“寄居江西省萍乡县湘东区湘东街的军属张学鸿，来我局申请补助路费时，我只凭她口头说明情形，未能详细审查她究竟是赴北京探亲还是找工作而予以适当处理。同时由于我的业务水平低，不但没有纠正江西省萍乡县湘东区湘东街人民政府不负责任乱开介绍信的错误，反而补助了军属张学鸿的路费，以致她徒劳往返，并且浪费了国家财力。这些都表现了我的不负责任的态度。除作深刻检讨外，保证今后在工作中一定认真负责，并加强业务学习，绝不再发生类似错误。”
    此次事件，说明了我局领导上仍存在着官僚主义作风。今后除加强干部业务学习外，并随时检查工作，使不再犯类似错误。
