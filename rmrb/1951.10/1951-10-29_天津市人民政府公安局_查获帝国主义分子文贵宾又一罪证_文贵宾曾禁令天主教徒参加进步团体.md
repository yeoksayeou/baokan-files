    Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau
    Uncovers Another Evidence of Imperialist Element Wen Guibin's Crimes
    Wen Guibin Forbade Catholics from Participating in Progressive Organizations

The towering crimes of Wen Guibin, an imperialist element within the Catholic Church who was expelled from the country by order of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau on May 28th of this year, in executing the reactionary orders of the Roman Curia and undermining the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, have been further substantiated by a recent letter from Wen Guibin to Bu Xiangxian, discovered by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau.

On July 13, 1949, the Vatican Curia issued an order on how Catholics should resist the Communist Party, stipulating that Catholics were prohibited from joining the Communist Party and various organizations and schools led by it; Catholics were prohibited from reading progressive books and newspapers, and punishment measures were prescribed for progressive Catholics.

This document was first broadcast by Vatican Radio and its contents were briefly reported in news programs by other reactionary radio stations. At the same time, it was published in the Vatican's semi-official Italian publication "Osservatore Romano" and the Vatican's official Latin publication "Acta Apostolicae Sedis." The Vatican Curia also sent this document to its envoys or representatives abroad, who notified the archbishops of their respective countries.

After receiving this document, Antonio Riberi, the "Papal Nuncio" in China, published it in the mimeographed publication "Lettre de Famille" of the Catholic Central Bureau in Shanghai, presided over by Father Legrand. After receiving this order, Wen Guibin (Jeande Vienne), the Catholic Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese, convened a meeting of more than ten Chinese and foreign priests, including Bu Xiangxian (Bonningue Alf), the "President" of the Tianjin Institute of the Society of Jesus and Vice President of Tianjin Jingu University, as well as Zheng Huamin (L·Steenstra, already expelled), Man Jishi (Hendrik MalieHermens, already arrested), Gan Molin (E·Kammerer), Ming Xingli (J·Mons Terleet, already expelled), Ling Anlan (L·Brellinger), and Zhang Ziliang, to discuss how to specifically implement this reactionary order and formulate a resolution plan. Wen Guibin signed and promulgated the resolution plan of this meeting on August 15th.

After receiving this resolution plan signed by Wen Guibin, Bu Xiangxian circulated it in sealed form among the members of the Society of Jesus, and on Sunday of that week, he explained it to all Catholics in the Jingu University Church, emphasizing that parents should prohibit their children from joining the New Democratic Youth League. After that, he continued to preach to Catholics in Jingu University, Sheng Gong Girls' High School, and "Legion of Mary" and other schools and reactionary organizations. This plan was also studied and discussed at a regular secret meeting composed of representatives from four schools: Jingu University, Fahan Middle School, Sheng Gong Girls' High School, and Xikai Middle School (representatives: Bu Xiangxian, Wang Jiwu, Wang Zhen, and Yang Yushu), presided over by Bu Xiangxian, to discuss specific implementation methods and report on the implementation situation. Prior to this, Bu Xiangxian had extracted this order from the "Lettre de Famille" publication and placed it in the priests' lounge for easy viewing.

After the crimes of imperialist elements such as Wen Guibin in continuously undermining the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and undermining the Catholic Reform Movement were exposed and denounced by patriotic Catholics, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, in accordance with the demands of the broad masses of Catholics, summoned Wen Guibin and expelled him from the country in accordance with the law. However, during the summons, Wen Guibin concealed and did not confess to the criminal facts of executing the reactionary orders of the Roman Curia and giving instructions to Bu Xiangxian. The Tianjin Public Security Bureau later obtained clues from the confessions of the criminals, imperialist elements Bu Xiangxian and Bao Yihua, and tracked down the original text of the letter. The original text is translated as follows:

Wen Guibin's letter to Bu Xiangxian

(Translation) How to abide by the Roman Curia's order of July 13, 1949

1.  How about cadres? Since there are several levels of cadres, a single regulation cannot be set. The positions of some cadres are not of great importance and are harmless, so the determination of guilt should depend on his position. Anyone who accepts the doctrines of Communism and teaches others, especially those who propagate doctrines, must of course be given the statutory punishment of excommunication. Only the bishop can pardon this punishment. (Canon 2314)

2.  Schools that are prohibited from attending: North China University, Revolutionary University, Public Security School, Military and Political University, Workers' School. Due to the nature of these schools, Catholics who attend them are at risk of apostasy, and Catholic students who enter the above schools cannot be given absolution. However, if there is an important reason for studying in the above schools, the permission of the bishop must be obtained.

3.  Organizations that are prohibited from joining: Youth League, Democratic Youth League, Southbound Work Team. Due to the nature of the above organizations, Catholics who become members cannot be given absolution and sacraments.

4.  Women's Federation: Catholics who voluntarily and willingly enter this association cannot be given absolution and sacraments.

5.  Catholics who voluntarily and willingly join the Communist army cannot be given absolution and sacraments, because that is really helping them.

6.  Trade unions and student unions cannot be completely prohibited from participating in the current situation.

7.  Newspapers: Although they are poisonous, reading cannot be completely prohibited, because professors, senior students, and businessmen need to read certain parts of newspapers. Therefore, everyone should read what they need to know according to their conscience, and everyone should be careful not to read theoretical things.

8.  Books that explain Communist doctrines are prohibited. However, if the principals and professors of schools need to read those books, they can read part or even all of them in order to protect students from the poison of false doctrines in advance. Priests who hold positions in schools may be allowed to read those books under certain special circumstances.

9.  Watch the changes in time, and the above regulations must be added or changed at any time.

    天津市人民政府公安局
    查获帝国主义分子文贵宾又一罪证
    文贵宾曾禁令天主教徒参加进步团体
    已于今年五月二十八日被天津市人民政府公安局明令驱逐出境的天主教内帝国主义分子文贵宾，在居留中国期间，执行罗马教廷反动命令，破坏中国人民革命事业的滔天罪行，从最近天津市公安局发现的文贵宾给卜相贤的一份手令中，更得到了充分的证明。
    一九四九年七月十三日，梵蒂冈教廷公布了一件天主教徒应如何对抗共产党的命令，规定禁止天主教徒加入共产党及其领导的各种组织、各种学校；禁止天主教徒阅读进步的书报，并订出了对进步的教徒们的惩罚办法等。
    此一文件首先经梵蒂冈电台广播，并由其他各个反动的广播电台在新闻节目中扼要报道其内容，同时在罗马出版的梵蒂冈半官方意大利文刊物“Obs-    ervatore    Romano”及梵蒂冈机关报拉丁文刊物“Acta 
   Apostolicae    Sedis”上公布。梵蒂冈教廷并向其驻外公使或代表寄发此一文件，并经该公使或代表通告各所在国家的大主教。
    在中国的“教廷公使”黎培里（Antonio    Riberi）收到此文件后，即在其上海办事处，罗岗（Legrand）神甫主持的公教教务协进会出版的油印刊物“家庭通信”（Lettre    de    Famille）上公布。天津教区的天主教主教文贵宾（Jeande    Vienne）接到这一命令后，即召集天主教耶稣会天津院的“院长”兼津沽大学副校长卜相贤（Bonningue 
   Alf）及郑化民（L·Steenstra，已驱逐出境），满济世（Hendrik 
   MalieHermens），已逮捕）、甘墨林（E·Kammerer）、明兴礼（J·Mons    Terleet，已驱逐出境），凌安澜（L·Brellinger）、张子良等中外籍神甫十余人集会讨论如何具体执行此项反动命令，并作出议决方案。文贵宾于八月十五日将此次会议的议决方案签名颁布。
    卜相贤接到这一文贵宾签名的议决方案后，即在耶稣会会员间依次密封传阅，并于当周的星期日在津沽大学教堂讲道时，对全体教徒逐条解释，着重指出：家长要禁止子女加入新民主主义青年团。此后，又不断在津沽大学、圣功女子中学及“圣母军”等学校及反动组织中对教徒宣讲。此一方案并曾在津沽大学、法汉中学、圣功女子中学、西开中学四校（四校代表：卜相贤、王际五、王珍、杨玉书）所组成的定期秘密会议上，由卜相贤主持，研究并讨论具体执行的办法及汇报执行的情况。在此以前，卜相贤曾从“家庭通信”刊物上将此项命令摘出，放在神甫休息室内以便于传观。
    文贵宾等帝国主义分子不断破坏中国人民革命事业、破坏天主教革新运动的罪行被爱国天主教徒揭露并进行控诉之后，天津市公安局根据广大天主教徒的要求，传讯文贵宾，并依法将其驱逐出境。但在传讯期间，文贵宾对于执行罗马教廷反动命令，并给卜相贤手令的犯罪事实，隐匿不供。天津市公安局后在案犯帝国主义分子卜相贤、鲍翊华口供中得到了线索，追查出该手令的原文。现将原文译出如下：文贵宾给卜相贤的手令原文
    （译文）如何遵守罗马教廷一九四九年
    七月十三日的命令
    一、对干部如何？既然干部有若干等，不能定出一个同一规定。有些干部的职任是无重大关系而且没有害的，所以断定罪过应看他的职位。凡是接受共产主义道理的，及教授他人的，尤其是宣传道理的，当然要给予革除教籍的法定处罚。只有主教一人可以赦免这种处罚。（法典二三一四条）
    二、禁止参加的学校：华北大学、革命大学、公安学校、军政大学、职工学校。由于这些学校的性质，教徒参加有背教的危险，凡天主教徒学生入了以上学校，就不能给他们听神功。但如有重要原因必须在以上学校读书时，须经主教许可。
    三、禁止参加的社团：青年团、民主青年同盟、南下工作团。由于以上各社团的性质，凡是教徒做了团员都不能给听神功及赦罪。
    四、妇女会：天主教徒自动地甘心情愿进入这会者，不能给他听神功及赦罪。
    五、天主教徒自动甘心愿意参加共产党的军队者，不能给他赦罪办神功，因为那是真正帮助他们的。
    六、工会及学生联合会，在目前形势下，不能完全禁止参加。
    七、报纸：虽然是毒害的，不能完全禁止阅读，因为教授们、高级学生们、商人们需要看报纸的某一部分。因此，每个人应当按着良心看自己须要知道的，每个人都要小心，不要看理论方面的东西。
    八、解释共产主义道理的书是被禁止的。然而学校的校长、教授们，如果有读那些书的必要时，可以看一部分甚至可以全看，以便预先保护学生不受假道理的毒害。在学校中有职任的神甫们，在某种特殊环境下，可以许可看那些书。
    九、看时机的变化，以上的规定得随时增添或改动。
