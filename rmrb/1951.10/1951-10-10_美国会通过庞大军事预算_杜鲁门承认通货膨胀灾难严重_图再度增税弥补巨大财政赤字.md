Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Washington dispatch, The US Congress Joint Conference passed the US 1951-1952 fiscal year military budget on October 2, totaling 57.2 billion US dollars. This is the largest military budget in US history during peacetime, an increase of about one-fifth over the already greatly increased military budget of the previous year, and about 40 times greater than the pre-war 1939 military expenditure.

If this amount is added to the 7.5 billion US dollars of appropriations for the so-called "Common Security Program" already passed by Congress to supply military materials to various vassal states; plus the approximately 5 billion US dollars in Korean War expenses that the Truman government will separately propose; plus the 5.9 billion US dollars appropriation passed by Congress in mid-September specifically for expanding or building military bases at home and abroad, as well as funds for the so-called strategic materials storage program, atomic energy appropriations, etc., the total amount of US expenses directly used for war preparation this year is nearly 80 billion US dollars.

When Truman presented the budget outline in January of this year, he already admitted that the huge military budget would cause the US government's revenue and expenditure deficit to reach as high as 16.5 billion US dollars this year. To make up for this deficit, Truman has asked Congress to approve the government's third tax increase since the outbreak of the Korean War, totaling at least 10 billion US dollars.

However, Truman's plan has encountered great difficulties. With next year being an election year, members of Congress have had to be cautious about agreeing to such a huge tax increase. Truman's $10 billion tax increase plan was reduced to $7.2 billion when it was voted on in the House of Representatives, and then reduced again to $5.45 billion when it was voted on in the Senate on the 28th of last month.

In this way, the Truman government, while implementing its massive military expansion plan, will inevitably face a huge fiscal deficit and the severe disaster of inflation. Truman's lie of "living within our means" to balance the budget has long been bankrupt. In fact, the annual rate of deficit in July, August, and September this year exceeded 10 billion US dollars. Senate Republican leader Taft warned as early as late June that the huge military expenditure of 90 billion US dollars would exceed the amount that the US economy could support by 20 billion US dollars. He said he could not see "where this money will come from". At the same time, even the report of his Council of Economic Advisers that Truman submitted to Congress on July 23 had to admit that the massive military expenditure would likely expand the inflationary pressure already caused by the military expansion plan to a "serious" degree.

### 美国会通过庞大军事预算  杜鲁门承认通货膨胀灾难严重  图再度增税弥补巨大财政赤字

    美国会通过庞大军事预算
    杜鲁门承认通货膨胀灾难严重
    图再度增税弥补巨大财政赤字
    【新华社八日讯】华盛顿消息，美国国会两院联席会议在十月二日通过了美国一九五一—一九五二财政年度的军事预算，共五百七十二亿美元。这是美国历史上和平时期最大的军事预算，比上年度已经大为增加的军事预算又增加了约五分之一，比战前一九三九年度军事费用约大四十倍。
    这个数目如果加上国会前此已经通过的，供应各附庸国家军事物资的所谓“共同安全计划”拨款七十五亿美元；加上杜鲁门政府将另外提出的可能有五十亿美元的朝鲜战争费用；再加上九月中旬国会通过专门用于在国内外扩充或建筑军事基地的五十九亿美元的拨款，以及此外的所谓战略物资储存计划经费、原子能拨款等等，美国本年度直接用于备战的费用总数几近八百亿美元。
    杜鲁门在今年一月提出预算概数时已经承认，巨大的军事预算将使美国政府本年度收支赤字高达一百六十五亿美元。为弥补这一赤字，杜鲁门已要求国会批准政府作朝鲜战争爆发以来的第三次增税，总数至少一百亿美元。
    但是，杜鲁门的这种打算却遭到了极大的困难，在明年就是大选年的前景下，议员们不得不对同意增加如此巨额的税收表示顾忌。杜鲁门的一百亿美元的增税计划前在众议院表决时，已被削减至七十二亿美元，到上月二十八日在参议院表决时，又再度被削减至五十四亿五千万美元。
    这样，杜鲁门政府在实施其庞大的扩军计划之时，必将面临庞大的财政赤字和严重的通货膨胀的灾难。杜鲁门所谓“量出为入”以平衡预算的谎话早经破产。实际上，今年七、八、九三个月的亏空年率就超过一百亿美元。参议院共和党领袖塔夫脱早在六月下旬就警告说，九百亿美元的巨额军费将超过美国经济所能支持的数目二百亿美元。他说他看不到“这笔钱将从那里来”。同时，连杜鲁门在七月二十三日送交国会的他的经济顾问委员会的报告，也不得不承认：庞大的军费，很可能使扩军计划已经引起的通货膨胀的压力扩大到“严重的”程度。
