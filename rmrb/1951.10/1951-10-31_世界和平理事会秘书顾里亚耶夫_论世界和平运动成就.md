Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 30th: World Peace Council Secretary Guryayev, in anticipation of the World Peace Council's Vienna meeting, published an article in Labor News on the 28th, discussing the great achievements of the world peace movement, stating: Since the World Peace Council's Berlin meeting passed the declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, a signature campaign has been launched in 65 countries worldwide over the past eight months. Currently, the number of signatures worldwide has reached over 560 million, an increase of 60 million compared to the number of signatures collected for the Stockholm Appeal in the past. The signature campaign has also made significant progress in countries where the movement to defend peace has been brutally suppressed. This proves that the people of all countries warmly support this historically significant declaration, and all activities carried out by the enemies of peace are futile.

Guryayev pointed out that the political level of the peace pact declaration signature campaign has also surpassed that of last year's Stockholm Appeal signature campaign. National peace committees have been established in Thailand, Nepal, South Africa, and several Latin American countries. The peace movement in Italy has spread to all levels of people across the country. Peace committees have been established in 360 cities in the United Kingdom, and these committees have close ties with peace committees in factories and residential areas. The peace movement in India is developing into a nationwide movement. In the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries, the signature campaign has sparked new political and labor upsurges among the working people, and strengthened their determination to fight for the defense of international peace and friendship.

Guryayev then said that the World Peace Council has expressed its support for convening various international conferences to attract a wider range of people to participate in the peace movement and to resolve major international issues related to the struggle to defend peace. Currently, preparations are underway for the International Economic Conference, which will discuss issues such as improving people's living conditions and expanding international economic relations. The International Medical Conference, prepared based on the proposal of Italian and French doctors, will discuss how to eliminate the adverse effects of war preparations on health services. Regional peace conferences in the Americas, Scandinavia, the Near East, and North Africa are being planned.

Guryayev said that the people of many countries are deeply feeling the enormous burden imposed on them by the arms race. The World Peace Council's Vienna meeting will extensively discuss this issue. The meeting will also review the demands of people of all countries for a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict and the conclusion of comprehensive peace treaties with Germany and Japan. The leading bodies of the peace movement also face the enormous task of strengthening and developing international cultural relations. Guryayev finally emphasized that the second session of the World Peace Council will undoubtedly be of great significance for ensuring the success of the movement to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, and for the victory of the just cause of international freedom and security.

    论世界和平运动成就
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：世界和平理事会秘书顾里亚耶夫，为迎接世界和平理事会维也纳会议，特于二十八日在劳动报上发表文章，论述世界保卫和平运动的巨大成就说：自从世界和平理事会柏林会议通过要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言以后，八个月来全世界已有六十五个国家展开了签名运动。现在全世界的签名人数已达五亿六千万以上，比过去为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集的签名人数增加了六千万人。在保卫和平的行动遭到残暴镇压的国家中，签名运动也进展得很有成绩。这就证明了各国人民热烈拥护这个具有历史意义的宣言，和平的敌人所进行的一切活动是徒劳无效的。
    顾里亚耶夫指出：和平公约宣言签名运动的政治水平，也超过了去年斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动的水平。泰国、尼泊尔、南非和拉丁美洲若干国家内已成立了全国和平委员会。意大利的和平运动已遍及全国各阶层人民。英国三百六十个城市中都成立了和平委员会，这些委员会和各工厂、居民区的和平委员会都有密切的联系。印度的和平运动正在发展成为全国规模的运动。在苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家，签名运动已在劳动人民中激起了新的政治和劳动热潮，并加强了他们为保卫国际和平和友好而斗争的决心。
    顾里亚耶夫接着说：世界和平理事会已表示赞成召开各种国际会议，以吸引更广大的人民群众参加和平运动，和解决与保卫和平斗争有关的各项主要的国际问题。现在，国际经济会议的准备工作正在进行着，这个会议讨论的问题有：改善人民生活条件和扩大国际经济关系等。根据意大利和法国的医师们的倡议而筹备的国际医药会议，将讨论如何消除战争准备在卫生事业方面所造成的恶果。美洲、斯堪的纳维亚、近东和北非的区域性的和平会议正在筹备中。
    顾里亚耶夫说：许多国家的人民正深深感到扩张军备运动所加在他们身上的巨大负担。世界和平理事会维也纳会议将广泛讨论这个问题。会议并将审议各国人民所提出的和平解决朝鲜冲突、缔结全面的对德对日和约的要求。和平运动的领导机构也面临着加强和发展国际文化关系的巨大任务。顾里亚耶夫最后强调说：世界和平理事会第二届会议对于确保争取五大国缔结和平公约运动的成功，和国际自由和安全的正义事业的胜利，无疑地是具有重大的意义的。
