The history of the Chinese people is filled with deeds of struggle for a free life. The Chinese people fought for a hundred years to defend their motherland and oppose imperialist aggression, and struggled for a thousand years to reclaim land from landlord exploitation, but failed to achieve victory. Only after the emergence of the working class and the Communist Party in China were the Chinese people's centuries-old desires realized, victory was achieved, the shackles of imperialism were broken, and the fetters of feudalism were shattered. The great victory of the Chinese people has strengthened the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is committed to peace and freedom. The Chinese people have undertaken the primary task in the cause of peace in Asia, and the Mongolian people are extremely excited about the Chinese people's glorious completion of this great task. The Chinese people established their own republic and changed the political landscape of Asia. This has shown all the people of other countries in Asia a good example of fighting against imperialist robbers and fighting for freedom and independence. The representatives of various countries who came here to participate in the celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China not only came to celebrate, but also to study and learn from the experience of the Chinese people's struggle. There are many things to learn from the Chinese people. The Chinese people have inflicted serious and most powerful blows on the vicious American imperialists who fantasize about enslaving the world, both on their own soil and in Korea. The losses suffered by the American imperialists in Korea now are greater than the losses suffered in the Pacific during World War II. We, the Mongolian people, together with the Chinese, Korean and other good people, will resolutely oppose the American imperialists' unilateral signing of the peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, and continuing the war of aggression in Korea.

Under the influence of the great socialist October Revolution and the care of the mentors of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, and with the assistance of our loyal friend, the Soviet people, the Mongolian people have freed themselves from feudalism and imperialist oppression, gained independence, and established a free and happy life for thirty years. We stand with the great Soviet Union and the Chinese people on the side of the world's democratic peace camp, and we are working tirelessly to consolidate world peace, to stop the bloody war waged by American imperialism in Korea, to stop the new wars of aggression being prepared by American imperialism, to sign a five-power peace pact, and to oppose the rearmament of Japanese militarism, mobilizing all our forces. I would like to tell our good friends, the Chinese people, this.

    蒙古人民和中国人民永远站在一起

    策·达木丁苏隆
    中国人民的历史是充满了为自由生活而斗争的事迹的。中国人民为着保卫祖国、反对帝国主义者的侵略战斗了百年，为着从地主剥削下夺回土地斗争了千年，但都未能获得胜利。只在中国出现了工人阶级和共产党以后，才实现了中国人民百年千年来的愿望，达到了胜利的境地，冲破了帝国主义的枷锁，摧毁了封建主义的桎梏。中国人民的伟大胜利，加强了以苏联为首的和平自由的社会主义阵营。中国人民在亚洲的和平事业中，负担起主要的任务，对于中国人民光荣地完成这个伟大任务，蒙古人民极感兴奋。中国人民建立了自己的共和国，改变了亚洲的政治面貌。这对于亚洲其他国家的全体人民，显示了反对帝国主义强盗，为自由独立斗争的好榜样。中华人民共和国成立的两周年纪念日，来此参加庆典的各国代表们，不仅是为庆祝而来，而且是为了研究和学习中国人民斗争的经验。向中国人民学习的东西是很多的，中国人民在自己的国土上以及在朝鲜，对幻想着奴役全世界的美国凶恶的帝国主义者们，给予了严重而最有力的打击。而美帝国主义者们，现在在朝鲜所受到的损失，较第二次大战时在太平洋所受到的损失还大。对于美帝国主义片面的签订对日和约及重新武装日本，在朝鲜继续着侵略战争，我们蒙古人民和中国、朝鲜以及其他善良的人民一道共同反对到底。
    蒙古人民在伟大的社会主义十月革命的影响和劳动人民的导师列宁、斯大林的关怀下在忠诚的友人——苏联人民的援助下，脱离了封建主义和帝国主义的压迫，获得了独立，建立起自由幸福生活已有三十年了。我们与伟大的苏联和中国人民一同站在世界民主和平的阵营方面，为着巩固世界和平，为着制止美帝国主义在朝鲜进行的血腥战争，为着制止美帝国主义准备进行的新的侵略战争；为着签订五大国和平公约，为着反对重新武装日本军国主义而动员着所有的力量而奋斗不懈。谨以此告诉我们的良友——中国人民。
