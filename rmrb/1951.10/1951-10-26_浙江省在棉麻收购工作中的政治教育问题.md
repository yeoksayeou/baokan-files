    Political Education Issues in Cotton and Hemp Procurement Work in Zhejiang Province
    Li Bin

    In order to smoothly carry out cotton and hemp procurement work, under the leadership of party organizations at all levels and the cotton and hemp procurement committees, Zhejiang Province has successively convened cotton and hemp farmer representative meetings, cooperative member representative meetings, and other various meetings to conduct patriotic education among the masses. In areas where political education has been conducted sufficiently, farmers have begun to enthusiastically sell cotton and hemp to the state. For example, in some areas of Haining, mass patriotic cotton and hemp sales challenge competitions have been launched between groups and villages. Changhe Town in Yuyao County invited workers from the Ningbo spinning factory to introduce the factory's production situation and the workers' love for the farmers, which strengthened the worker-peasant relationship and promoted the patriotic cotton sales movement. The farmers said, "The yarn spun by the factory is fine, even, and fast, much better than our homespun cloth. The plows, hoes, and knives we use are all made by workers. Workers and peasants are connected by flesh and blood; neither can do without the other." This promoted the cotton and hemp procurement work.

    However, in many areas, the phenomenon of farmers hoarding cotton and hemp is still very serious, and many farmers still have serious ideas of "holding out for higher prices and being reluctant to sell," disregarding the interests of the state. For example, in Nanyang Township, Ninth Village, Xiaoshan County, where mass mobilization was relatively good, the amount of cotton sold by farmers only accounted for about 69 percent of the harvest. This reflects that there are still problems with the propaganda and education work for farmers.

    Some cadres lack sufficient understanding of the long-term nature of educating farmers, and therefore simplify the work of conducting patriotic propaganda and education for farmers. For example, some cadres hold one or two farmer meetings, simply saying "The state needs cotton, we should sell cotton to the state, whoever sells cotton to the state is patriotic and glorious," and think that the ideological problems of the farmers have been solved. However, because many farmers lack sufficient understanding of the great political significance of selling cotton and hemp to the state, ensuring the supply of raw materials for the country's industry, stabilizing prices, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidating national defense, which also protects the fundamental interests of farmers, their response is: "If the state offers more money, we will naturally sell to the state. There's no need for you to talk so much and waste time."

    On the other hand, the propaganda work in some areas is currently one-sided. Some cadres only conduct comparative education, that is, they only organize farmers to recall the various exploitations and sufferings experienced by cotton and hemp farmers during the Kuomintang rule, and recognize the benefits of the People's Government's support for farmers' production and reasonable procurement policies after the land reform. This is certainly necessary, but they have not paid attention to guiding farmers to understand the relationship between the individual and the state, the relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests, so as to further improve their political consciousness. Therefore, some farmers believe that selling cotton to the state is simply to "repay gratitude." Even some middle peasants say, "Selling cotton is the business of poor peasants; poor peasants should 'repay gratitude' to the state, and middle peasants can ignore it." There is also a tendency to simply calculate economic accounts. For example, some cadres simply promote listening to price increases and not price drops, and ensuring capital and value preservation, which in turn promotes the capitalist thinking of farmers. Some farmers react by saying, "Cotton prices will definitely rise in the future, so don't rush to sell cotton." A district cadre in Cixi County promoted four benefits of selling cotton: "Not bitten by insects; not bitten by rats; not burned by fire; not stolen by wives." This is obviously propaganda without any political content. As a result, the farmers' thinking was not straightened out, and women were dissatisfied.

    In some places, the principle of the worker-peasant alliance is not clearly explained, and even the significance of patriotic cotton and hemp sales for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is misinterpreted. For example, some cadres only say: "Selling cotton to the state is to prevent factories from stopping work and workers from becoming unemployed." In fact, even if the factory stops work, it is not only a problem of workers becoming unemployed and being detrimental to workers, but also detrimental to the country and to all the people, and therefore also detrimental to farmers. Such propaganda makes farmers mistakenly understand that selling cotton to the state is simply to relieve the workers.

    The above problems have been discovered by several leading organs. The proper resolution of these problems will further advance the cotton and hemp procurement work in the entire province of Zhejiang.

    浙江省在棉麻收购工作中的政治教育问题
    李斌
    浙江省各地为顺利进行棉麻收购工作，在各级党组织与棉麻收购委员会的领导下，先后召开了棉农麻农代表会、合作社员代表会以及其他各种会议，向群众进行爱国主义教育。凡政治教育进行得充分的地方，农民已开始踊跃地把棉麻卖给国家。如海宁部分地区即已展开了组与组、村与村的群众性的爱国售棉售麻挑战竞赛。余姚县长河镇曾聘请宁波纺纱工厂工人介绍工厂生产情况及工人对农民的热爱，密切了工农关系，推动了爱国售棉运动。农民说：“工厂纺的线细、匀、快，比我们织土布不知要好多少倍，我们用的犁、锄、刀都是工人制造的，工人农民血肉相连，谁也离不了谁。”这样就推动了棉麻收购工作。
    但是，许多地区的农民存棉留麻现象还很严重，不少农民还存在着严重的不顾国家利益的“看高惜售”等思想。如发动群众较好的萧山县南阳乡第九村，农民出售棉花的数量也仅占收获量的百分之六十九左右。这反映了对农民的宣传教育工作还有问题。
    部分干部对教育农民的长期性认识不足，因之把对农民进行爱国主义宣传教育的工作简单化了。如有的干部召开一、二个农民大会，只是说说“国家需要棉花，我们应该把棉花卖给国家，谁把棉花卖给国家谁就爱国，谁就光荣”，就以为解决了农民的思想问题。但由于不少农民对于把棉麻卖给国家，对保证国家工业原料的供应、稳定物价、巩固工农联盟和巩固国防因而也是保护农民的根本利益的重大政治意义认识不足，所以他们的回答说：“国家出钱多了自然卖给国家，还用你来说三道四的，耽误工夫。”
    另一方面，目前有些地区的宣传工作还存在着片面性。有的干部只是进行对比教育，即只是组织农民回忆国民党统治时期棉农麻农所受的各种剥削痛苦，认识土地改革后人民政府扶助农民生产及合理收购政策的好处等。这当然是很必要的；但没有注意引导农民认识个人和国家的关系，眼前利益和长远利益的关系，以进一步提高他们的政治觉悟。因而有些农民认为把棉花卖给国家，单纯是为了“报恩”。甚至部分中农还说“卖棉是贫农的事，贫农应该向国家‘报恩’，中农可以不管”。还有一种单纯算经济账的偏向。如有的干部单纯地宣传听涨不听落、保本保值等，结果反而助长了农民的资本主义思想。有的农民就反应：“将来棉花一定还会涨，不要着急卖棉。”慈溪县有一个区干部宣传售棉有四好：“不被虫咬；不被老鼠咬；不会被火烧；不会被老婆偷掉。”这显然是毫无政治内容的宣传。结果农民思想没通，并造成妇女不满。
    有些地方对工农联盟的道理还讲得不清楚，甚至曲解了爱国售棉售麻对巩固工农联盟的意义。如有的干部只是说：“棉花卖给国家是为了使工厂不停工，工人不失业。”事实上，即使工厂停工也不仅仅是工人失业对工人不利的问题，而且对国家对全体人民都不利，因此对农民也不利。这样的宣传，使农民错误地了解卖棉花给国家是单纯为了救济工人。
    上述问题已为若干领导机关所发现。这些问题的适当解决，将使浙江全省的棉麻收购工作向前推进一步。
