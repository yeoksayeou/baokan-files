    The People's Republic of China is two years old. On this festive occasion, we celebrate with indescribable joy. I remember when Beijing was first liberated, people only felt that the People's Liberation Army was good, disciplined, and kind. But it was still quite unfamiliar, and we were not sure if this was the government we should support. Now, open your eyes and look at the amazing progress and great achievements in military affairs, politics, education, transportation, trade, municipal administration, and water conservancy in the past two years. In terms of foreign affairs, we defeated the Japanese imperialist invasion and resisted the American imperialist aggression. The Chinese people have not only stood up but also stood firm. Our international status has been raised to an unprecedented level. We feel honored and proud to be born in this new China! Comparing the present to the series of corrupt, incompetent, greedy, and traitorous so-called governments of the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, there is a world of difference! We support the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

    庆祝中华人民共和国成立两周年

    中华人民共和国成立两周年了。欣逢这个节日，我们欢呼庆祝，有说不出道不尽的愉快心情。记得北京刚一解放，人们只觉得解放军真好，纪律严明，待人和气。但是究竟陌生得很，还不敢断定这就是我们所应当拥护的政府。现在呢，打开眼睛看看这两年来军事、政治、教育、交通、贸易、市政、水利方方面面都有惊人的进步，伟大的成就。对国外说，打败了日本帝国主义侵略之后，又抵抗了美帝国主义的侵略。中国人民不但站立起来而且站得很稳。国际地位因此空前提高。生长在这个新中国，我们感觉光荣，感觉骄傲！将现在比过去的那连串腐败无能贪污卖国的满清、北洋、蒋匪等等所谓政府，真有天壤之别！我们拥护中华人民共和国，拥护中央人民政府，拥护中国人民解放军，拥护中国共产党，拥护毛主席，拥护朱总司令！
