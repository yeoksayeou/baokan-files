    Educating the Families of Counter-Revolutionaries
    Mao Zhifan
    After Beijing carried out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in a big way, the ideological situation of some of the families of counter-revolutionaries was quite chaotic: some did not understand the seriousness of their relatives' counter-revolutionary crimes, and therefore cried "injustice"; some were afraid of being implicated because they had close relations with counter-revolutionaries, and felt panic; some thought that the people despised the families of counter-revolutionaries, and were pessimistic and disappointed; and even a few families of counter-revolutionaries, deeply influenced by reactionary ideas, even妄想to carry out retaliatory activities against the people. In light of these circumstances, the Beijing Public Security Bureau notified all public security sub-bureaus to convene meetings of the families of counter-revolutionaries to patiently educate them.

    At the meetings held by the various sub-bureaus, public security personnel explained in detail to the families of counter-revolutionaries the rationale behind the People's Government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries, exposed the crimes of the counter-revolutionaries, and explained that when the government dealt with counter-revolutionary criminals, it had repeatedly consulted with the people and carefully handled them according to the crimes of the counter-revolutionaries, which was completely in line with reality. At the same time, the public security personnel repeatedly explained to the families of counter-revolutionaries that, according to the policies of the People's Government, family members who had not participated in counter-revolutionary activities would never be implicated, and that family members of counter-revolutionaries who sincerely approached the people would never be discriminated against, and the facts had already proved this: when the government confiscated the property of counter-revolutionary criminals, it tried its best to take care of the lives of their families. The government and the broad masses of the people welcome the families of counter-revolutionaries to sever their ideological ties with counter-revolutionaries, eliminate residual reactionary ideas, and approach the people. Public security personnel also emphasized at the meeting that if anyone is still obsessed and does not abandon the counter-revolutionary stance, or even attempts to carry out retaliatory sabotage activities, they will be severely punished.

    After the education, many family members changed their fearful attitude when they first arrived at the meeting, listening to the report and nodding in agreement. Some were moved to tears, and some could not help but shout the slogans that they had been unwilling to hear in the past: "Support the People's Government's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries." The wife of special agent Guo Huijun said, "After listening to the report of the sub-bureau chief, I realized that Guo Huijun had killed nine people. I used to cry 'injustice'! Now I know he deserves to be shot." Wang Changrong, the son of bandit Wang Zhiheng, used to want to "avenge" and "settle accounts" for his father, but now he cursed angrily: "This thing deserves to be shot! Look! How many families has he harmed!" The wife of Jiu Gong Dao leader Wang Zhongxin said, "After listening to the sub-bureau chief's words that one person is responsible for one's actions, my mind has been enlightened, and I no longer blindly worry about whether I will be implicated." The daughter of traitor Sui Yumin said, "In theory, I feel that my father should be killed. Emotionally, I still felt uncomfortable at the time. I only felt that he was good to his family, but I didn't realize that he was so cruel to the people. This is a mistake I made because I didn't stand on the people's side." Chi Wuliang, the daughter of traitor Chi Zongmo, said: "I now understand that to love the country, you cannot love a reactionary father; to love a reactionary father, you cannot love the country. I want to be a daughter of the new China, to stand on the people's side, not a traitor's daughter." Some family members resolutely stated at the meeting that they would respond to the government's education of themselves with practical actions. The daughter of Yiguan Dao leader Liu Xiangting said: "I must do a good job in production and abide by the patriotic pact to respond to the government's love and education for me." The wife of traitor Zhang Renli said: "I will educate my children well so that they can become good sons of the people. I will sort out Zhang Renli's property and everything and explain it clearly to the government."

    教育反革命分子家属
    毛之范
    北京市大张旗鼓镇压反革命以后，一部分反革命分子家属的思想情况曾是相当混乱的：有的不了解自己亲属的反革命罪行的严重性，因而叫“屈”叫“冤”；有的因自己曾与反革命分子发生过密切关系，怕被牵连，感到恐慌；有的以为人民鄙弃了反革命分子的家属，而悲观失望；更有个别反革命分子家属，因受反动思想的影响较深，竟妄想向人民进行报复活动。北京市公安局根据这些情况，通知各公安分局分别召开了反革命分子家属会，对他们进行了耐心的教育。
    在各分局所召开的会上，公安人员向反革命分子家属详细地讲解了人民政府必须坚决镇压反革命的道理，揭发了反革命分子的罪行，说明政府在处理反革命罪犯时，曾再三和人民群众商量，按照反革命分子的罪行，分别慎重处理，完全切合实际。同时还向反革命分子家属反复说明，根据人民政府的政策，凡是没有参与过反革命活动的家属决不会受到牵连，而真心诚意靠拢人民的反革命分子家属，则决不会受到歧视，而且事实也已证明了这一点：政府在没收反革命罪犯的财产时，尽量照顾了他们家属的生活。政府和广大人民群众是欢迎反革命分子家属割断与反革命分子在思想上的联系，清除残余的反动思想，靠拢人民的。公安人员在会上也着重指出：如有人还执迷不悟，不放弃反革命立场，甚至妄图进行报复破坏活动，那便会受到严厉惩处。
    经过教育以后，许多家属改变了刚到会时的那种惶恐态度，倾听着报告，并连连点头称是。有的被感动得流了泪，有的情不自禁地喊出了过去他们所不愿听的“拥护人民政府坚决镇压反革命分子”的口号。特务郭惠君的妻子说：“听了分局长的报告，才知道郭惠君曾杀害了九条人命，以前我还喊
    ‘冤’呢！现在知道他真该毙。”土匪王志恒的儿子王长荣以前还想给他父亲“复仇”“算账”，现在却愤愤地骂着：“这东西，真该毙！你瞧！他害过多少人家啦！”九宫道头子王中心的妻子说：“听了分局长说一人做事一人当的话，可使我心眼亮开了，不再瞎捉摸会不会牵连自己了。”汉奸隋育民的女儿说：“处决我父亲，从理论上讲，我觉得他该杀，在感情上当时仍感到难受。我只觉得他对家里人还好，而没有想到他对人民是那样的残忍，这是我不站在人民立场上看问题所产生的错误。”汉奸池宗墨的女儿池无量说：“我现在了解了要爱国就不能爱反动的爸爸，爱反动的爸爸就不能爱国。我要作新中国的女儿，要站在人民立场，不作汉奸的女儿。”有的家属在会上坚决表示要以实际行动来回答政府对自己的教育。一贯道头子刘翔亭的女儿说：“我一定要搞好生产，遵守爱国公约，来回答政府对我的爱护和教育。”汉奸张仁蠡的妻子说：“我要好好教养孩子，使他成为人民的好儿子。我要清理张仁蠡的财产和一切，向政府交代清楚。”
