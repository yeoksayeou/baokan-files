	Comrades Showing Films in the Countryside Should Do More Explanatory Work for the Audience

Editor Comrade:

	On September 8th, the Central Film Projection Team showed two films in Liujiayuan Village, Fifth District, Zhangli County, Shandong Province: "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze" and "Rural Happiness." Both films were well-received by the masses, especially "Rural Happiness," which was even more educational for the masses and rural cadres. However, during the screening, the projectionists did not explain to the masses, which led to many viewers not understanding certain plots, and even misunderstanding them. For example, when "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze" was shown, two militiamen behind me mistook the People's Liberation Army for Japanese devils, and some even mistook the tattered prisoners for the People's Liberation Army. This negated the educational significance for the audience. Therefore, I hope that comrades in the projection team will do more explanatory work for the masses when showing films.

### 下乡放映电影的同志要多对观众作解释工作

    下乡放映电影的同志要多对观众作解释工作编辑同志：
    九月八日，中央电影放映队在山东章历县第五区刘家园村演了两部片子，一部是“百万雄师下江南”，一部是“农家乐”。这两部片子都很适合群众的口味，尤其是“农家乐”，对群众和乡村干部的教育意义更大。但在放映时，放映人员没给群众解释，以致不少观众对某些情节没有看懂甚而发生误解。如演“百万雄师下江南”时，在我背后就有两个民兵把人民解放军错看成日本鬼子，也有把破烂不堪的俘虏错看成人民解放军的。这就失去了对观众的教育意义。因此，我希望放映队同志在放映电影时要向群众多做解释工作。
