Viewing Northeast China's Construction from the Materials Exchange Exhibition
	Lin Li

In September, a grand Northeast China Materials Exchange Exhibition was held in Shenyang. Thousands of industrial products were arranged in a tall and beautiful building; the rich agricultural and special products of Northeast China were displayed in the spacious halls of the Forbidden City. From here, people saw the great creations of the working class in Northeast China, and also the labor achievements of more than 30 million farmers. Here, people saw that Northeast China's industrial and agricultural production was advancing rapidly, and people's material and cultural life was improving step by step. This speed of progress and improvement broke the old historical conventions and changed the face of history.

Preparing for National Industrialization

Northeast China is the base for our country's industrialization. Industrial production once accounted for 56 percent of Northeast China's national economy. Taking 1943, the year with the highest industrial production in Northeast China, as the base, during the two years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule (1946 to 1948), the total value of all industrial production decreased to 20 percent. After liberation, the recovery of industrial production in Northeast China was quite rapid. Last year, the total value of industrial production reached 73.1 percent of 1943, and this year it will reach at least 84.9 percent of 1943; the output of some industrial products and some factories and mines has exceeded any previous period. For example, the production volume of Dalian Glass Factory last year exceeded the highest record of the enemy and puppet era by 2.9 times; the output of small steel products in Anshan exceeded the output of 1943 by more than two times; the output of Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 4 exceeded the output of 1943 by more than three times. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in the steel industry is faster than that of general industries; the production of the machinery industry is more than the production of consumer goods. In 1950, the output of steel ingots exceeded the output of 1949 by 3.53 times, and the output of pig iron increased by 3.15 times in the same period. During the enemy and puppet period, the production of consumer goods accounted for 41 percent of the total value of industrial production, and the production of means of production accounted for 59 percent. At present, the production of means of production by state-owned industries in Northeast China accounts for 85.1 percent, and the production of consumer goods accounts for 14.9 percent. The rapid development of the steel and machinery industries provides conditions for industrialization.

From the exhibition of industrial products, another characteristic of the development of industry in Northeast China can also be seen, that is, the improvement of production technology and product quality. During the period of enemy and puppet rule and Kuomintang reactionary rule, Northeast China's industry could only produce raw materials, or only process parts. At that time, technology was in the hands of imperialism. After liberation, the imperialists once estimated that the construction of industry in Northeast China could not be separated from them. But facts have proved that after getting rid of imperialist rule, industry in Northeast China has developed better and faster. The Dalian Glass Factory is an example. The factory has not only increased its production volume year by year, but also trained a large number of new technical personnel in production, ensuring the quality of glass. The factory's products are divided into three grades. In the early days of liberation in 1947, first-class products accounted for only 8.6 percent, and third-class products accounted for 52.2 percent; this year, after putting forward the slogan of eliminating third-class products and increasing special-grade products, special-grade products accounted for 1.97 percent in the first half of the year, first-class products accounted for 88.03 percent, second-class products accounted for 10 percent, and there were no third-class products at all.

Many machines that had to be imported from capitalist countries in the past can now be manufactured in Northeast China. In the Ministry of Steel and Machinery Industry, thousands of lathes and machine parts, such as huge hydro-generators, turbine generators used in windlasses, rock drills used for mining and chiseling rocks, air compressors used for controlling power, seamless chains for towing 50 tons of weight, as well as tungsten steel, stainless steel, hexagonal or octagonal hollow steel, and various types of machine tools with different performance, we are now not only able to manufacture, but also able to manufacture very well.

Agriculture is Developing Rapidly

The precise figures of various agricultural products displayed at the Northeast China Materials Exchange Exhibition show that the continuous growth of industrial production has strongly promoted the rapid development of agriculture.

Northeast China's agricultural production in 1950 had recovered to 99.48 percent of the past highest record, and this year it plans to exceed the past highest record with a figure of 107.6 percent. Because Northeast China has a vast area and fertile land, and the entire region has implemented land reform, the party and government leading organs at all levels have vigorously led and organized agricultural mutual assistance, and developed agricultural production in a planned manner. Therefore, the development of agriculture in Northeast China, especially the production of industrial raw materials and special crops, is very rapid. The output of cotton last year increased by two and a half times compared with the previous year, and this year it will increase by one and a half times compared with last year; the output of soybeans this year will exceed the past highest output by 11.9 percent; the output of wheat is equivalent to 201 percent of 1943; This shows that agricultural production in Northeast China is advancing on the road of serving industrial production, and provides favorable conditions for the development of industrial production.

After the completion of land reform in Northeast China, iron plows have been widely used. In the spring and summer rainy season last year, more than 59,300 pieces of new-style agricultural implements were promoted throughout the region; in the first half of this year, more than 25,000 new-style plows, shovels, rakes, and other agricultural implements were supplied to farmers. The number of production units using a complete set of Soviet-style animal-drawn agricultural implements has increased from 39 mutual aid teams last year to 104 mutual aid teams this year. New-style agricultural implements have greatly improved agricultural productivity and saved labor. The He Fengshan team in Hejia Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province, which used new-style agricultural implements, had an average yield of 4,200 catties per hectare last year, which was 800 catties more per hectare than when using old-style agricultural implements. When using new-style agricultural implements to plant soybeans, the average yield per hectare was 4,986 catties, while when using old-style agricultural implements, the yield was only 3,425 catties, a difference of one-third. Therefore, the vast number of farmers are rushing to buy new-style agricultural implements. The reform of production tools has prompted farmers to gradually overcome their conservative thinking. After He Fengshan discovered that the scattered land of the team affected production, he consulted with the entire team and agreed to connect the team's land into two large pieces in the south and north of the village for cultivation. This method of cultivation has strongly promoted the agricultural production of the team.

The exhibition also showcased the situation of mechanized farms built with state investment after liberation, using modern agricultural implements such as tractors and combine harvesters. From 1948 to the present, Northeast China has successively built more than 40 state-owned farms, with a cultivated land area of 150,000 to 160,000 hectares, a modern mechanical traction force of more than 30,000 horsepower, and more than 2,000 various agricultural implements; state-owned farms in Northeast China have accounted for 1 percent of Northeast China's agricultural economy. Although the proportion of mechanized farms is still small, it is a new and developing force, and therefore the most promising. It is creating conditions and experience for the collectivization of agriculture throughout the country.

Social Purchasing Power Gradually Increases

With the rapid recovery and development of industry and agriculture, people's living standards are gradually improving, and social purchasing power is rising accordingly. The charts at the exhibition show that the purchasing power of the people in Northeast China has increased by 2.5 times in the past two years. Goods that were considered surplus in the past are now insufficient; the usual commercial "off-season" has turned into a "peak season"; and the number of eggs and live pigs, which have always been exported and imported in large quantities, has now decreased. In recent years, the actual supply quantity of state-owned trading organizations has exceeded the pre-determined plan.

The increase in people's purchasing power has opened up a broad market for industrial production. In many places, the exhibition compared the production capacity of Northeast China with the actual needs of the people. For example, if the amount of cloth needed by the people in Northeast China is taken as 100, the textile industry in Northeast China can currently only supply 57 percent. The cotton needed by the textile industry, the rural areas can only supply 41 percent. The former encourages workers to produce more and better cloth; the latter requires farmers to continue to expand cotton fields to meet the needs of the textile industry. The workers and farmers of Northeast China are advancing hand in hand under the guidance of the great thought of the worker-peasant alliance.

Cultural Upsurge

After visiting the cultural construction section of the exhibition, people can find that the cultural life of the people in Northeast China is leaping forward with the development of production. Now, there is an average of one newspaper or magazine for every 34 people in Northeast China. The publishing organs of the people in Northeast China published more than 950,000 copies of books throughout 1946, which has increased sixteenfold five years later. The number of college students has increased fourfold compared with the period of enemy and puppet rule, and the number of middle and primary school students has doubled. There are more than 2.2 million farmers in rural areas who regularly participate in spare-time schools, and more than 500,000 workers and staff in public factories and mines who regularly participate in political, cultural and technical studies. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated in the Lushun-Dalian area. In the coal mines, which used to be the most culturally backward, the great task of eliminating illiteracy will also be completed in the next three years. Grassroots cadres in factories, mines, and rural areas have mostly improved their political, cultural, technical level, and working ability through spare-time schools.

Another aspect of the cultural upsurge is the unprecedentedly active cultural and recreational life. There are more than 1,000 clubs or cultural palaces distributed in factories, mines, forests, and cities. The development of amateur cultural work groups, professional theater troupes, and other literary and artistic and broadcasting undertakings is also very considerable.

    从物资交流展览大会看东北建设
       林里
    九月里，沈阳市举行了规模宏大的东北区物资交流展览会。千万件工业产品，布置在一幢高大漂亮的楼房里；丰饶的东北农产、特产，陈列在宽阔的故宫殿堂里。从这里，人们看到了东北工人阶级的伟大创造，也看到了三千多万农民的劳动成果。在这里，人们看到东北的工农业生产在飞速前进，人民的物质生活与文化生活在步步提高。这种前进与提高的速度，打破了历史的陈规，改变了历史的面貌。
  为全国工业化做准备
    东北是我国工业化的基地。工业生产曾占东北国民经济的百分之五十六。以东北工业生产最高的一年——一九四三年为基数，在国民党反动派统治的二年期间（一九四六年至一九四八年），全部工业生产量总值降为百分之二十。解放后，东北工业生产的恢复相当迅速，去年工业生产总值已达一九四三年的百分之七三点一，今年至少可达一九四三年的百分之八十四点九；若干工业产品和若干厂矿的产量，已超过以往任何时期。如大连玻璃厂，去年生产量超过敌伪时代产量最高纪录的二点九倍；鞍山小型钢材产量超过一九四三年产量两倍多；沈阳橡胶四厂的产量超过一九四三年三倍有余。这里值得注意的是：钢铁工业的上升速度比一般工业快；机械工业的生产，比消费资料的生产多。一九五○年的钢锭产量，超过一九四九年的产量三点五三倍，同一时期的生铁产量，提高三点一五倍。敌伪时期消费资料生产占工业生产总值的百分之四十一，生产手段的生产占百分之五十九。目前，东北国营工业的生产手段的生产占百分之八十五点一，消费资料的生产占百分之十四点九。钢铁工业和机械工业的飞速发展，为工业化提供了条件。
    从工业产品的展览上，也可看到东北工业发展的另一特点，这就是生产技术与产品质量的提高。在敌伪和国民党反动派统治时期，东北工业只能生产原料，或只做加工配件，那时候，技术是掌握在帝国主义手里。解放后，帝国主义者曾经估计，东北工业的建设是不能离开他们的。但是事实证明，摆脱了帝国主义的统治以后，东北工业发展得更好、更快了。大连玻璃厂就是一个例子。该厂不仅生产量逐年增加，而且从生产中锻炼出大批新型的技术人员，保证了玻璃质量。该厂产品分三级，一九四七年解放初期，一级品只有百分之八点六，三级品占百分之五十二点二；今年提出消灭三级品、增出特等品的口号后，上半年的特等品占百分之一点九七，一级品占百分之八八点○三，二级品占百分之一○，三级品根本没有了。
    过去必须依赖资本主义国家输入的许多机器，现在东北能够制造了。在钢铁和机械工业部里，千百种车床和机件，如庞大的水轮发电机、卷扬机上用的透平发电机、开矿凿石用的凿岩机、控制动力用的空气压缩机、牵引五十吨重量的无接缝练子、以及钨钢、不锈钢、六角或八角中空钢，和各种不同性能的工作母机等，现在我们不仅能够制造，而且能制造得很好。
  农业在飞速发展
    东北区物资交流展览会上展示出各种农产品的精确数字，显示出工业生产的不断增长，有力地推动了农业的飞速发展。
    东北的农业生产，一九五○年已恢复到过去最高纪录的百分之九十九点四八，今年计划以百分之一○七点六的数字，超过以往的最高纪录。由于东北地广土肥，全区已实行了土地改革，各级党政领导机关，大力领导组织农业互助，有计划地发展农业生产，因而东北区的农业、特别是工业原料及特种作物的生产，发展是很快的。棉花的产量去年比前年增加两倍半，今年又将比去年增加一倍半；大豆今年产量将超过过去最高产量的百分之十一点九；小麦产量相当于一九四三年的百分之二百零一；这说明：东北的农业生产，是在为工业生产服务的道路上前进的，并给发展工业生产提供了有利的条件。
    东北区完成土地改革后，已广泛采用铁犁了。去年春夏雨季，全区推广新式农具五万九千三百余件；今年上半年又供给农民新式犁、铲趟机和其他农具二万五千多台。使用全套苏联马拉农具的生产单位，已由去年的三十九个互助组，发展成今年的一百零四个互助组。新式农具大大提高了农业生产力，节省了劳动力。吉林省榆树县何家村使用新式农具的何凤山小组，去年每垧土地平均产量四千二百斤，比使用旧式农具时，每垧多产八百斤。用新式农具种大豆，每垧平均产量四千九百八十六斤，用旧式农具耕作时，只产三千四百二十五斤，两者相差达三分之一。因此，广大农民都争先恐后地购买新式农具。生产工具的改革，促使农民逐渐克服了保守思想。何凤山发现该组因土地分散影响生产后，即商得全组同意，把全组土地联成村南、村北两大片，在大块土地上耕种。这种耕作方法，有力地推动了该组的农业生产。
    展览会上，还展示了解放后由国家投资建设的，使用拖拉机、康拜因机等近代化农具生产的机械化农场的情况。从一九四八年迄今，东北先后建成四十余处国营农场，拥有耕地达十五、六万垧，近代化机械牵引力三万余匹马力，各种农具两千余台；东北的国营农场，已占东北农业经济的百分之一。机械化农场的比重虽然还小，但它是新生的、发展的力量，因此是最有前途的。它给全国农业集体化，创造着条件和经验。
  社会购买力逐步提高
    随着工农业的迅速恢复与发展，人民的生活水平日渐提高，社会购买力随之上升。展览会的图表说明：两年以来，东北人民的购买力已上涨二点五倍。过去认为多余的物资，今天已感不足；历来的商业“淡季”已转为“旺季”；向来出口和入关数量很大的鸡蛋和活猪，现在外销的数量已减少了。几年来国家贸易机关的实际供应数量，都超过事前预定的计划。
    人民购买力的提高，为工业生产开辟了广阔的市场。展览会在许多地方将东北的生产能力和人民的实际需要做了对比。如将东北人民需布量作为一百，目前东北纺织业只能供应百分之五十七。纺织业所需要的棉花，农村只能供给百分之四十一。前者激励工人生产更多更好的布匹；后者要求农民继续扩大棉田，供应纺织工业需要。东北的工人与农民，正在工农联盟的伟大思想指导下携手前进。
  文化高潮
    参观了展览会的文化建设部分之后，人们可以发现东北人民的文化生活，正在随着生产的发展飞跃前进。现在东北平均每三十四人有一份报纸或刊物。东北人民的出版机关，一九四六年全年出书九十五万余册，五年后提高了十六倍。大学生与敌伪统治时期相比，增加了四倍，中、小学生增多了一倍。农村中有二百二十余万农民，常年参加业余学校，公营厂矿有五十多万职工，常年参加政治、文化与技术学习。旅大地区基本上消灭了文盲。过去文化最落后的煤矿中，也要在今后的三年中完成扫除文盲的伟大任务。工厂、矿山和农村的基层干部，大都靠业余学校提高了他们的政治、文化、技术水平与工作能力。
    文化高潮的另一方面，是空前活跃的文化娱乐生活。分布在工厂、矿山、森林和城市的俱乐部或文化宫有一千多处，业余文化工作团、职业剧团及其他文学艺术与广播事业的发展，也是很可观的。
