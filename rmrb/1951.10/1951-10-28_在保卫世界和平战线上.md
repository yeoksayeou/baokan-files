    On the Front Lines of Defending World Peace
    Japanese People Oppose Remilitarization
    Not long ago, an art exhibition by the famous Japanese progressive female painter Toshiko Akamatsu was held in Yokosuka. The subject of the exhibition was the tragic scene of Hiroshima being bombed by the atomic bomb in 1945. The Japanese people clearly remember how much disaster the war of aggression brought them. In order to avoid a more tragic recurrence of this disaster, the Japanese people have actively launched a struggle to defend peace and oppose remilitarization. At the aforementioned exhibition, more than 3,000 people signed the World Peace Council's declaration. More than 5.5 million people in various parts of Japan have signed the Peace Pact Declaration. Nearly as many people have signed petitions against Japanese remilitarization. Recently, a "Month for Opposing the Ratification of the Separate Peace Treaty" campaign has been launched in various parts of Japan. From trade union organizations, workers, intellectuals to Christian pastors, they have all demanded that the Diet refuse to ratify the separate peace treaty and the "U.S.-Japan Security" Treaty, oppose the U.S. occupation of Japan, and demand the resignation of the traitorous Yoshida government. Only through resolute struggle can the Japanese people save themselves from the war disaster brought by the United States.

    American Peoples to Hold the American Peace Congress
    The fighters of the peace movement in the Americas are preparing to hold the American Peace Congress at the end of November or the beginning of December. The preparatory committee for the congress has been established. The committee includes a Chilean female poet, an American professor of theology, the President of the National Assembly of Guatemala, an Argentinian director, the former Vice President of the Republic of Peru, a Brazilian architect, a Uruguayan writer, a fighter for Cuban independence, a Costa Rican professor, a member of the National Assembly of Ecuador… People of different faiths have launched various efforts for the common cause of defending peace. The preparatory committee has received dozens of letters from well-known figures in various American countries, all of whom agree to convene this conference.

    The aggressive policy of the United States has increasingly threatened the people of the world, including the people of the Americas, with war. The U.S.-driven movement to expand armaments by governments in the Americas has caused huge sacrifices for the people of various countries, which makes the people of the Americas increasingly aware of the importance of defending peace. In Uruguay, with a population of more than two million, more than 200,000 people have signed the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers.

    New Developments in the Peace Movement in the Five Nordic Countries
    Prominent social figures from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland have initiated the convening of a Congress of Peace Supporters from the Nordic countries from November 30th to December 2nd. This is a new development in the peace movement in the Nordic countries since the World Peace Council's Berlin meeting in February this year called for the organization of regional peace conferences.

    The peace fighters in the Nordic countries have long been working to defend peace. In the recent signature campaign for the Peace Pact Declaration, more than 521,300 people have signed in Finland, 250,000 in Sweden, and 125,900 in Denmark. The Norwegian Peace Congress recently issued a statement calling on the Norwegian people to "express their desire for peace through signatures." The convening of this Congress of Peace Supporters from the Nordic countries will surely strengthen the peace movement in the Nordic countries and will help maintain the security of the Nordic countries and promote their economic and cultural development.

    在保卫世界和平战线上
    日本人民反对重新军国主义化
    不久以前，横须贺举行了一次日本著名进步女画家赤松年子的画展。画展的题材是描写一九四五年广岛被原子弹轰炸的惨状。日本人民清楚地记得，侵略战争曾给他们带来多少灾祸。为了避免这一灾祸更悲惨地重演，日本人民积极开展了保卫和平、反对重新军国主义化的斗争。就在上述的展览会上，有三千多人在世界和平理事会的宣言上签了名。日本各地参加和平公约宣言签名的已有五百五十万人以上。还有将近同样多的人在反对日本重新军国主义化的请愿书上签了名。最近日本各地又展开了“反对批准单独和约和平月”的运动。从工会组织、劳动者、知识分子到基督教牧师，都纷纷要求国会拒绝批准单独和约和“美日安全”条约，反对美国占领日本，并要求吉田卖国政府辞职。日本人民只有进行坚决的斗争，才能把自己从美国的战争灾难里挽救出来。美洲各国人民将举行美洲
    和平大会
    美洲各国和平运动的战士准备在十一月底或十二月初举行美洲和平大会。大会的筹备委员会已经成立。委员中有智利的女诗人，美国的神学教授，危地马拉的国民议会主席，阿根廷的导演，前秘鲁共和国的副总统，巴西的建筑师，乌拉圭的作家，古巴独立斗争的战士，哥斯达黎加的教授，厄瓜多尔的国民议会议员………各种信仰不同的人们，都为保卫和平这一共同的事业展开了多方面的努力。筹备委员会已收到了数十封美洲各国知名人士的来信，他们都赞成召开这一会议。
    美国的侵略政策使全世界人民包括美洲人民日益受着战争的威胁，美国驱使美洲各国政府扩张军备的运动使各国人民蒙受了巨大的牺牲，这就使美洲各国人民日益感到保卫和平的重要。在两百多万人口的乌拉圭，已有二十多万人在世界和平理事会关于五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名。北欧五国和平运动的新发展
    瑞典、挪威、丹麦、冰岛和芬兰的著名社会人士已发起在十一月三十日到十二月二日举行北欧各国和平拥护者大会。这是世界和平理事会今年二月柏林会议号召组织区域性的和平会议以来，北欧各国和平运动的新发展。
    北欧各国的和平战士们很早以来就为保卫和平而努力。最近的和平公约宣言签名运动，芬兰已有五十二万一千三百多人签名，瑞典有二十五万人，丹麦十二万五千九百人。挪威保卫和平大会最近又发出文告，号召挪威人民“以签名来表示他们对和平的愿望。”这次北欧各国的和平拥护者大会的召开，必将使北欧各国的和平运动更加壮大，并将有助于维护北欧各国的安全，和促进她们的经济文化的发展。
