    Suggestions for Xinhua Bookstore to Improve Distribution Work
  (1) Comrade Editor:
    The distribution work of periodicals by the Xinhua Bookstore General Store has some shortcomings. Taking the periodicals we subscribe to as an example, we often experience missing issues and duplicate issues. "New Observer," "Current Affairs Handbook," etc., have all been missing issues. The "New Observer" recently sent as a replacement clearly had "Volume 2, Issue 12" on the label, but inside was "Volume 2, Issue 10" (which we have returned). Furthermore, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" issues 102 to 104, 20 copies each, have already arrived, but were then sent again in duplicate (a total of 60 copies, which we have also returned). Duplicate mailings are a waste of manpower and materials, while missing issues affect our learning. We suggest that the store inspect its periodical distribution work in order to thoroughly improve this work.

  (2) Comrade Editor:
    Based on our experience subscribing to books and periodicals, we believe that the Xinhua Bookstore's distribution work has some shortcomings. For example, on July 15th, our department ordered "Sino-Soviet Friendship," "Introduction to the Soviet Union," "New Observer," "Current Affairs Handbook," etc., from the Siping Xinhua Bookstore in Liaoxi Province. It has now been a month and a half, and we have not received a single issue. We have inquired with comrades at the Siping Xinhua Bookstore several times, and they always reply, "We will ask the General Store," but the General Store has not responded. Also, "Current Affairs Handbook" issue 18 was published on July 5th, but we did not receive it until July 29th when we went directly to the Xinhua Bookstore. In addition, the "World Knowledge" we ordered used to have eight extra copies sent each issue. We believe that the store should quickly correct the above shortcomings.
                    Political Department of a certain PLA unit    Yang De Tian
  (3) Comrade Editor:
    I am someone who does propaganda work and urgently needs to know domestic and international events in a timely manner. Therefore, I subscribed to "World Knowledge" last autumn. For the first few months, I received it on time, but after January of this year, things changed: it was often delayed. We have raised our concerns several times, but have not received a positive response. Finally, we submitted a written opinion to the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore General Store in the name of the organization. The subscription department wrote back on August 4th, saying in essence that they were also very sorry about this, but "unable to do as one wishes, there are indeed some objective limitations," because the post office has many problems, either backlogs or losses. For example, a batch of "Current Affairs Handbooks" they sent out on June 5th did not reach a reader in Qian'an County, Hebei Province, until July 3rd. They believe that there is no way to fix this, "We have known for a long time that this matter is serious, but we cannot drastically seek improvement."
    I think the store must have objective difficulties, but these difficulties should be overcome.
                Propaganda Department of the CCP Shenyang Heping District Committee    Wang Xing Ren

    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many letters from readers expressing opinions on the distribution work of the Xinhua Bookstore. We are now publishing three of these letters here. The distribution of books and periodicals is an important political task, and we hope that everyone will work hard to do this well.

### 建议新华书店改进发行工作

    建议新华书店改进发行工作
  （一）编辑同志：
    新华书店总店的期刊发行工作，是有一些缺点的。以我处所订的期刊杂志来说，就经常发生断寄和重寄的事情。我们订的“新观察”、“时事手册”等都曾断寄过。最近补寄来的“新观察”，明明贴头上写着二卷十二期，但里面包的却是二卷十期（我们已经退回）。再如“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”第一○二期至一○四期各二十份，已经寄到了，但却又重复寄来（一共六十份，我们也已退回）。重寄是人力物力的浪费，而断寄影响我们的学习，我们建议该店检查一下期刊发行工作，以便彻底改进这一工作。
                中共热河省委宣传部    李正冠（二）编辑同志：
    从我们定阅书刊的情况看来，我们认为新华书店发行工作有些缺点。例如七月十五日我部曾在辽西省四平新华书店订购“中苏友好”、“苏联介绍”、“新观察”、“时事手册”等，直到现在已一个半月，还未收到一期；我们几次询问四平新华书店同志，他们总是回答“待我们问问总店”；而总店也无答覆。又如“时事手册”第十八期在七月五日就出版了，但我们一直到七月二十九日直接去新华书店才拿到。另外，我部订的“世界知识”，过去每期都多寄来八份。以上缺点，我们认为该店应该赶快改正。
                    解放军某部政治部    杨德田（三）编辑同志：
    我是一个做宣传工作的人，迫切要求及时知道国内外的大事，因此，在去年秋天，我就订阅了“世界知识”。起初几个月都能按时收到，但到今年一月以后就不同了：常常延误时日。我们曾提过几次意见，都未得到正面答复。最后我们用机关名义向北京新华书店总店提了书面意见，该店订阅科在八月四日写了一个回信，大意说：他们对这一点也很遗憾，但是“力不从心，事实是有一些客观的限制”，因为邮局方面有很多问题，不是积压，就是遗失。例如他们在六月五日寄出一批“时事手册”，到达河北迁安县一个读者手中时已是七月三日了。他们认为这件事没办法，“这件事我们很早就知道是严重的，可是总不能大刀阔斧地求得改善”。
    我想，该店一定有客观困难，但这些困难，应该设法克服。
                沈阳市和平区委宣传部    王兴仁
    编者按：最近我们连续接到许多读者来信，对新华书店的发行工作提出意见。现在选登三封来信在这里。书刊发行工作是一个重要的政治任务，希望大家努力，把这件事情作好。
