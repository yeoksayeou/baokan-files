Xinhua News Agency, 29th Tokyo dispatch: Under the manipulation of the American occupiers and their Japanese lackeys, the Yoshida group, the Japanese Diet's House of Representatives passed the Separate Peace Treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty" on the 26th. These two war treaties have been submitted to the Japanese House of Councillors for deliberation, and the House of Councillors will make a decision in November.

In the House of Representatives, members of the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and some members of the Socialist Party voted against the passage of the two treaties. JCP member Hyakuro Hayashi and Labor-Farmer Party member Hisao Kuroda, among others, delivered speeches before the vote in the House of Representatives, denouncing the two treaties. Hayashi said: The separate peace treaty and the "Security Treaty" "cannot bring the peace and independence desired by the people"; Japan's economy "will be squeezed by these two treaties." He called on the Japanese people to continue to oppose these two treaties and make them "waste paper."

As previously reported, in order to get the Japanese Diet to pass the two treaties, the US and Japanese reactionaries used various despicable means to coerce and buy off members of the Diet from various reactionary parties. But even so, some members of the reactionary parties are deeply worried about the consequences of passing these treaties. For example, Koji Ogawa, a member of the National Democratic Party, stated on the 20th in the House of Representatives "Special Committee on Treaties" that he was "afraid that the continued stationing of US troops in Japan would plunge Japan into war."

The measures taken by upper-level members of the Japanese Socialist Party to betray the interests of the Japanese nation and support the separate peace treaty have caused a split within the party. On October 5, the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party passed a resolution by a narrow margin "approving the (separate) peace treaty and opposing the Security Treaty." However, when this resolution was submitted to the Socialist Party's 8th Extraordinary Congress, which began on October 23, serious differences of opinion arose at the Congress. On the 24th, the Congress was declared a failure. The left wing, which opposed both treaties, and the right wing, which approved the separate peace treaty and opposed the "Security Treaty," parted ways, held separate meetings, and attacked each other as illegal. During the vote on the two treaties in the House of Representatives, members of the two factions of the Socialist Party also took different attitudes. Prior to this, most local organizations of the Socialist Party had decided to oppose the two treaties. The Socialist Party's official newspaper, "Social News," admitted that the party's organizations in 28 prefectures had decided to oppose the Diet's ratification of the two treaties.

Outside the Diet, the mass movement of the Japanese people against the separate peace treaty and the "Security Treaty" continues to unfold widely in all strata of society. On the 25th, when the House of Representatives "Treaty Committee" first decided to approve the two treaties, 7,000 students from 20 universities and vocational schools in Tokyo held a demonstration in front of the Diet building to protest the approval of the two treaties. Students at Tohoku University in Sendai held a strike to protest the approval of the two treaties. Clearly, the reactionary members of the Japanese House of Representatives cannot represent the will of the Japanese people by passing the separate peace treaty and the "Security Treaty."

### 美日反动派操纵日本众院  通过两项卖国条约

    美日反动派操纵日本众院
    通过两项卖国条约
    【新华社二十九日讯】东京消息：美国占领者及其日本走狗吉田集团的操纵下，日本国会众院已于二十六日通过单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”。这两项战争条约已送交日本参院审议，参院将在十一月作出决定。
    在众院中投票反对通过两项条约的有日本共产党和劳农党的议员以及社会党的一部分议员。日共议员林百郎和劳农党议员黑田寿男等在众院表决之前，均曾发表演说，痛斥两项条约。林百郎说：单独和约和“安全条约”“不能带来人民所渴望的和平和独立”；日本的经济“将受到这两项条约的压榨”。他号召日本人民继续反对这两项条约，并使之“成为废纸”。
    如前已报道的，美、日反动派为了使日本国会通过两项条约，曾使用各种卑鄙的手段，对各反动政党的国会议员进行威逼和收买。但即使如此，某些反动政党的议员，也对通过这些条约的后果深为忧虑。例如，国民民主党议员小川半次二十日在众院
    “条约特别委员会”上表示，他“恐怕美军留驻日本，会把日本投入战争”。
    日本社会党上层分子出卖日本民族利益、支持单独和约的措施，已引起该党内部的分裂。十月五日，社会党中央执行委员会以少数之差通过了“赞成（单独）和约，反对安全条约”的决议。但是，当这一决议送交十月二十三日开始举行的社会党第八届临时大会批准时，大会发生了严重的意见分歧。二十四日，大会宣告流产。反对两项条约的左派和赞成单独和约、反对“安全条约”的右派，分道扬镳，各自召开会议，并互相攻击对方为非法。在众院对两项条约进行表决时，社会党两派的议员也采取了不同的态度。在此以前，社会党的大多数地方组织都决定反对两项条约。社会党机关报“社会新闻”承认：该党的二十八个县的组织，已决定反对国会批准两项条约。
    在国会之外，日本人民反对单独和约和“安全条约”的群众运动，继续在各阶层中广泛地展开。二十五日，当众院“条约委员会”首先决定要批准两项条约时，东京二十个大学和专科等学校的学生共七千人，在国会大厦的前面举行了示威，抗议批准两项条约。仙台的东北大学学生为了抗议批准两项条约，举行了罢课。显然地，日本众院的反动议员们通过单独和约和“安全条约”，决不能代表日本人民的意志。
