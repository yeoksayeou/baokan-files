    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC Instructs Party Committees at All Levels to Strengthen Political Education on Cotton Purchasing Work

    Editor's Note: Strengthening political education for cotton farmers and promoting their patriotic enthusiasm so that they consciously sell their cotton to the state is a primary responsibility of Party organizations in cotton purchasing work. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC's timely instruction to its subordinate Party committees at all levels to strengthen political work among cotton farmers is entirely necessary. We publish excerpts here for reference by other regions.

    Hebei Province is a major cotton-producing area in the country. Whether the province can complete the cotton purchasing task according to the state's planned target has a significant impact on the normal production of yarn factories nationwide, the supply of clothing for the military and civilians, and the stability of commodity prices. Therefore, actively completing the state's cotton purchasing task is a major political task for Hebei Province at present. To this end, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC issued instructions on October 12 to strengthen cotton purchasing propaganda work, requiring all localities to conscientiously accept past experiences and lessons, and, in the spirit of being truly responsible to the country and the people, do a good job in propaganda work to ensure the completion of the cotton purchasing task.

    Regarding the content of the propaganda, the Provincial Committee pointed out: It is necessary to conduct in-depth patriotic education in conjunction with the cotton farmers' own interests, educating them to view current interests from the perspective of broader, long-term benefits. It is necessary to enhance the idea of worker-peasant mutual assistance and break down the conservative and erroneous ideas held by some cotton farmers, such as refusing to sell cotton without cash, holding out for higher prices, fearing to reveal wealth, and fearing to borrow money. To this end, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the following to Party members, cadres, and the broad masses of farmers: (1) Cotton farmers' prosperity through cotton cultivation is the result of vigorous support, rewards, and assistance from the Communist Party and the People's Government. Without the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, without reasonable cotton-grain price ratios, without the policy of equal burden on grain and cotton fields, without state loans and fertilizers, and without timely leadership for cotton farmers to overcome disasters, there would be no bumper cotton harvest, and cotton farmers would not prosper. Therefore, providing the state with sufficient cotton in a timely manner to supply raw materials for the textile industry is a duty that cotton farmers owe to the country. Actively selling cotton to the state is a practical action of loving the motherland. (2) The worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural mutual assistance are the basic policies of our country. Farmers should provide workers with sufficient industrial raw materials to develop industrial production; workers should provide farmers with essential industrial goods to ensure the needs of the people's lives. Only with the development of industry can the production and living standards of farmers continue to improve. Therefore, it is necessary to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class. (3) American imperialism is invading Korea, forcibly occupying Taiwan, and implementing an economic blockade against our country, attempting to suffocate us economically. In order to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, the people of Hebei Province, with their long revolutionary tradition, must coordinate with the heroic fighting of the volunteers, launch a warm patriotic movement of selling and storing cotton, and sell and store cotton to the state as quickly as possible to support the country's industrial production and more forcefully strike at the aggression of American imperialism. (4) Promptly selling cotton to the state is beneficial to the cotton farmers themselves because the state has entrusted local cooperatives to purchase cotton in a unified manner, with reasonable prices, simplified procedures, and time savings, preventing cotton farmers from being exploited by speculative private merchants.

    In addition to educating Party members, cadres, and the masses of farmers, it is also necessary to educate cotton peddlers and private merchants to strictly abide by government laws and regulations, emphasizing that they should subordinate small profits to large profits and individual interests to the interests of the state. Absolutely no private rush purchases, price gouging, or market disruption will be allowed.

    Regarding propaganda methods: (1) The Party branches in cotton-producing areas should first conduct mobilization at meetings of all Party members, clear up the thinking of Party members, enhance their political understanding, summarize past experiences in selling and storing cotton, specifically study the current cotton storage situation in the entire village and the ideological situation of cotton farmers, formulate a work plan to mobilize the masses to sell cotton, and educate Party members to take the lead. Then, under leadership, convene meetings of League members, propagandists, cooperative members, and women's representatives to conduct full mobilization and discussion, break down concerns, and help them make cotton sales plans. The Party branches and propagandists in cotton-producing areas should treat this work as an important part of their work in the coming period. Propaganda instructors' stations should universally instruct on cotton purchasing work. When report givers at all levels report to cotton-producing areas, they should take mobilizing the masses to sell cotton as one of the important contents. (2) Launch a cotton sales movement in various cotton-producing villages by inspecting and revising patriotic pacts. List selling and storing cotton as one of the main items of the pact; promote the cotton purchasing movement effectively through the inspection and revision of the patriotic pact. (3) Convene various types of mass discussion meetings to explain the reasons, dispel concerns, and encourage everyone to recall and launch competitions. In particular, hold good parents' discussion meetings and family women's discussion meetings to mobilize them to engage in competitions of patriotism, hardship, and meritorious service with the volunteers, promoting the development of cotton sales work.

    The Provincial Committee finally pointed out: In propaganda and mobilization, attention should be paid to preventing coercion and commandism, and preventing the setting of overly high slogans (such as not keeping a single pound of cotton). It should be selling to the state what is left over after self-use. Attention should also be paid to close integration with local economic departments, conducting propaganda based on the actual possible conditions of material supply, and not blindly "promising" too much, resulting in failure to realize them and causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

### 中共河北省委指示各级党委  加强购棉工作的政治教育

    中共河北省委指示各级党委
    加强购棉工作的政治教育
    编者按：加强对棉农的政治教育，发扬棉农的爱国热忱，自觉地把棉花售给国家，这是在购棉工作中党的组织应负的主要的责任。中共河北省省委及时地指示所属各级党委加强对棉农的政治工作，这是完全必要的。特摘要发表，供各地参考。
    河北省是全国主要的产棉区，该省能否按照国家的预定计划完成购棉任务，对全国纱厂正常的生产，军民衣着的供应和物价的稳定有着重大的关系。因此，积极完成国家的购棉任务，乃是河北省当前重大的政治任务。中共河北省委为此于十月十二日发出加强购棉宣传工作的指示，要求各地认真接受已往的经验教训，本着对国家对人民切实负责的精神，作好宣传工作，以保证购棉任务的完成。
    在宣传内容上省委指出：要结合棉农的切身利益进行深入的爱国主义教育，教育农民从远大利益上来看目前的利益，要提高工农互助的思想，打破部分棉农不用钱不卖棉，看涨惜售，怕露富，怕借贷等保守思想和错误思想。为此必须向党员干部和广大农民反复说明：（一）棉农种棉发家，是共产党与人民政府大力扶植和奖励、帮助的结果。没有党和人民政府的领导，没有合理的棉粮比价，没有粮田、棉田同等负担的政策，没有国家的贷款贷肥和及时领导棉农战胜灾害，就没有棉产的丰收，棉农就不会发家。因此，充分及时地供给国家用棉，供应纺织工业原料，是棉农对国家应尽的职责。积极把棉花卖给国家，就是热爱祖国的实际行动。（二）工农联盟，城乡互助，是我们国家的基本政策。农民应当供给工人以充分的工业原料，以发展工业生产；工人则应当供给农民以工业必需品，以保证人民生活的需要。工业发展了，农民的生产和生活水平，才能继续提高。因此，必须进一步巩固以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟。（三）美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，强占台湾，并对我国实行经济封锁，想从经济上窒死我们。为了抗美援朝保家卫国，有长期革命传统的河北省人民，一定要配合志愿军的英勇作战，展开热烈的售棉储棉的爱国运动，把棉花赶快卖给和存给国家，以支持国家的工业生产，更有力地打击美帝国主义的侵略。（四）迅速出卖棉花给国家，对棉农本身是有利的，因为国家已委托各地合作社统一收购，价格合理，手续简便，节省时间，棉农不致受投机私商剥削。
    除教育党员干部和农民群众外，同时要教育棉贩私商严格遵守政府法令，强调要他们小利服从大利，个人服从国家。绝不允许私自抢购，哄抬市价，扰乱市场。
    在宣传方法上：（一）产棉区党的支部，首先应在全体党员会议上进行动员，打通党员思想，提高党员的政治认识，总结过去售储棉花的经验，具体研究目前全村的存棉情况与棉农的思想情况，订出发动群众卖棉的工作计划，并教育党员首先以身作则。然后，有领导地分头召开团员、宣传员、合作社员及妇女代表会议，进行充分地动员和讨论，打破顾虑，帮助他们作出卖棉计划。产棉区党的支部与宣传员，要把这一工作，作为今后一定时期的重要工作内容。宣传员传授站应将购棉工作普遍进行传授。各级报告员向产棉区进行报告时，都应把动员群众卖棉作为重要内容之一。（二）发动各产棉村从检查与修订爱国公约中，开展售棉运动。把售储棉花列为公约的主要项目之一；通过爱国公约的检查与修订，有效地推动购棉运动。（三）召开各种不同性质的群众座谈会议，说明道理，解除顾虑，启发大家回忆，发动竞赛。尤应开好家长座谈会与家庭妇女座谈会，发动他们和志愿军比爱国、比艰苦、比功劳的竞赛运动，推动售棉工作的开展。
    省委最后指出：在宣传动员中，应注意防止强迫命令，防止提出过高的口号（如不留一斤棉等）。应是除掉自用的以外卖给国家。并应注意和当地经济部门密切结合，根据物资供应实际可能的条件进行宣传，不要盲目地“许愿”太多，结果实现不了，引起群众不满。
