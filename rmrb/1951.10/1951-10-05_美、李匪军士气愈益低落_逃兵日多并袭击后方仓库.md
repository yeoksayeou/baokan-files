Xinhua News Agency, 4th - According to a dispatch from the Telepress Agency in Manila on the 2nd: American officers arriving in Manila have revealed that the US military command in Korea is increasingly concerned about the growing number of American soldiers who oppose continuing the war of aggression against Korea. One officer said that the new commander of the US Tenth Corps, Byers, recently had to report the increasingly undisciplined state of his troops to Ridgway.

According to Byers' report, the stalemate in the Kaesong negotiations has greatly disappointed those American and Syngman Rhee's soldiers who had hoped for an early end to the war through the Kaesong talks. Some soldiers are refusing to obey the orders of their superiors. Not only individual soldiers but entire units are abandoning their front-line positions spontaneously. All of this demonstrates their active anti-war sentiment.

Byers reported that deserters from the US and Syngman Rhee's forces are evading the US military police and fleeing to ports in South Korea, hoping to find a way to leave Korea, thus disrupting the rear area activities of the US and Syngman Rhee's forces. Byers cited specific examples that occurred in Busan, Masan, Daegu, and other cities, where deserters attacked military grain depots and armories. Deserters and warehouse guards have had numerous clashes, sometimes even exchanging gunfire.

Entire units of South Korean soldiers who have deserted are hiding in the deep mountains, attacking convoys heading to the front lines. Byers said that this is hindering the regular supply of troops.

Relations between the US military and the South Korean army have deteriorated to the point where armed conflicts frequently occur.

Byers admitted that the morale of the US military and Syngman Rhee's forces makes him concerned about the outcome of the offensive that the US military is preparing on the Korean front.

    美、李匪军士气愈益低落
    逃兵日多并袭击后方仓库
    【新华社四日讯】据电通社马尼拉二日讯：来马尼拉的美国军官们透露：侵朝美军司令部对于美军中愈来愈多的士兵反对继续进行侵朝战争的情形，愈益感到不安。其中一个军官说：新任美军第十兵团司令官拜尔斯近来不得不把他的军队愈来愈没有纪律的情况，报告李奇微。
    据拜尔斯报告，开城谈判走上僵局的事实，使那些把早日结束战争的希望寄于开城谈判的美国士兵和李承晚军士兵，大为失望。某些士兵拒绝服从长官的命令。不仅个别的士兵而且整队的士兵自动放弃前线阵地。这一切都表现了他们积极反战的情绪。
    拜尔斯报告说：美军和李承晚军的逃兵，避开美军宪兵，逃到南朝鲜各港口，希望找到离开朝鲜的办法，这样，就扰乱了美、李军的后方活动。拜尔斯列举了在釜山、马山、大邱和其他城市发生的具体实例：逃兵曾在那些地方袭击军粮库和军火库。逃兵和仓库卫兵曾发生多次冲突，双方有时竟互相开枪射击。
    整队开小差的南朝鲜军士兵躲藏在深山里，他们袭击开往前线的汽车队。拜尔斯说：这使军队的经常供应受到妨碍。
    美军与南朝鲜军之间的关系，已经恶化到时常发生武装冲突的地步。
    拜尔斯承认，美军和李承晚军的这种士气，使他担忧美军在朝鲜前线正在准备的进攻的结果。
