Dear Chairman Mao:
    The day of victory for the Chinese people—the October 1st National Day—has arrived, and all members of our group are welcoming this great festival with unparalleled joy. First of all, we offer the four new records we have created in the last seven days, increasing production efficiency by four to five times, as a National Day gift to you.
    In the production process of nearly nine months this year, our group has completed the nine-month production task one month, two days, and five hours ahead of schedule. The quality of all products reached 99.78 percent. We created a total of nineteen new records in nine months and put forward seventeen rationalization proposals, all of which were adopted by the administration. While completing these production tasks, all members of our group responded to the various calls of the motherland with unparalleled enthusiasm. Since the China People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression issued the three major calls on June 1st, our group has revised the patriotic pact, merging the past competition conditions, patriotic pact, and factory protection pact into a unified patriotic competition pact, and stipulating a long-term donation plan of donating 50 percent of the excess bonus and one day of work per month. In August, in response to the call for increasing production and practicing economy by Comrade Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, the group first formulated a plan to increase production and save 30 tons of grain in the five months of the second half of the year, and later increased it to 44 tons of grain. We are completing this plan month by month. The wealth increased and saved in August was equivalent to the value of more than 9 tons of grain, exceeding the plan for that month.
    In the past nine months, the production skills of each of our group members have been significantly improved. All skilled workers in the group have learned the "high-speed cutting method." In July and August, due to the application of the Kovalev work method and the rational adjustment of labor organization, the operating time of each machine was increased by 2.14 minutes.
    Because everyone is enthusiastic about learning technology and improving skills, from September onwards, Ma Hengchang of our group has been promoted to deputy director of the lathe workshop, group leader Xu Jingrong has been promoted to team leader, and another ten apprentices have been promoted to assistant craftsmen. In the past nine months, we have strengthened political study (including current affairs study), which has improved our ideological awareness and strengthened mutual unity. The technicians in our group often hold meetings with us to study production, combining technical theory with practical experience. For example, when workers come up with ways to improve tools, technicians come to help draw drawings, which strongly guarantees the success of improving production technology. The relationship between teachers and apprentices in our group has become more normal, truly realizing the slogan of "teachers teaching attentively and apprentices learning enthusiastically," thereby improving the apprentices' ability to produce independently. Since learning the "high-speed cutting method," we have broken the conservative thinking that existed in the past, and not only realized that the "high-speed cutting method" can be applied to Soviet-style lathes, but also to old Japanese-style lathes. With the continuous improvement of ideological awareness, our entire group not only knows that we must work hard to produce, defeat the aggression of American imperialism, and build a new democratic society, but also knows that we must build a beautiful socialist society in the future.
    Dear Chairman Mao! When we celebrate National Day, we cannot help but think that our lives have been improving day by day in the past few years. For example, our group leader Xu Jingrong ate bean cakes during the puppet Manchukuo period and had to borrow clothes when he got married; today, he can not only eat two-thirds of fine grains every month, but also has four sets of new clothes. Every time we think of these things, we gain unparalleled strength and are full of confidence in the economic construction of the motherland. We are determined to avoid complacency and impetuosity, and under your correct leadership, continue to work hard to carry out the economic construction of the motherland, so that our motherland will become increasingly prosperous and strong, and transition to a happy socialist society in the future!
    Wishing you good health!
                              Respectfully, all members of the Ma Hengchang Group
                                  September 23rd

    马恒昌小组写信给毛主席祝贺国庆
    提前完成生产任务并创造新纪录作为献礼
    决心不骄不躁继续努力进行祖国经济建设敬爱的毛主席：
    中国人民胜利的日子——十月一日国庆节来到了，我们小组全体组员正以无比愉快的心情来迎接着这个伟大的节日。我们首先以最近七天中创造出提高生产效率四倍到五倍的四种新纪录作为国庆节向您的献礼。
    我们小组在今年近九个月的生产过程中，已提前一个月零两天五小时完成了九个月的生产任务。全部产品质量达百分之九十九点七八。九个月中总共创造了十九种新纪录，并提出十七项合理化建议，全被行政方面采纳。在完成这些生产任务同时，我们全体组员更以无比的热情响应祖国的各种号召。自六月一日中国人民抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，我们小组又从新修订了爱国公约，把过去订的竞赛条件、爱国公约、护厂公约合并，统一订成爱国竞赛公约，并订出捐献超额奖金百分之五十和每月献工一天的长期捐献计划。在八月份中，为响应东北人民政府高岗主席的增产节约号召，全组首先订出下半年五个月增产节约三十吨粮食、后来又增订为四十四吨粮食的计划。这个计划我们正逐月完成着，其中八月份增产和节省的财富等于粮食九吨多的价值，超过了当月的计划。
    过去九个月中，我们每个组员的生产技术都得到显著提高。全组技工都学会了“高速切削法”。七、八两月由于运用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，合理调整了劳动组织，每台机器的开动时间又得以增加了两点十四分钟。
    由于大家热心学习技术、提高技术，从九月份起，我组马恒昌已被提升为车工场副主任，组长徐景荣被提升为班长，另有十名徒工被提升为帮工匠。九个月来，我们加强政治学习（包括时事学习），因之提高了我们的思想觉悟，加强了互相间的团结。我们小组的技术员经常和我们在一起开会研究生产，使技术理论与实际经验相结合。如工人想出改进工具的办法，技术员就来帮助画图，这有力地保证了改进生产技术的成功。我组的师徒关系已更为正常，真正实现了“老师用心教，徒弟热心学”的口号，因而提高了徒工独立生产的能力。自学习“高速切削法”后，我们已打破了过去存在的保守思想，不仅认识到“高速切削法”能适用于苏联式车床，即旧的日本式的车床也能应用。在思想觉悟不断提高的情形下，我们全组不仅已经知道要努力生产，打败美帝国主义的侵略，建设新民主主义社会，而且还知道了要在将来建设社会主义的社会。
    亲爱的毛主席！当我们庆祝国庆的时候，我们不能不想到几年来我们的生活已日益改善。例如我们组长徐景荣，伪满时吃豆饼，娶媳妇时要借衣服穿；今天他不仅每月能吃三分之二的细粮，而且还有四套新衣服。我们每一想到这些，便增加了无比的力量，对祖国的经济建设充满了信心。我们决心不骄不躁，在您正确的领导下，继续努力进行祖国的经济建设，使我们的祖国日益富强，并在将来过渡到美满的社会主义社会！
    祝您健康！
                              马恒昌小组全体组员敬上
                                  九月二十三日
