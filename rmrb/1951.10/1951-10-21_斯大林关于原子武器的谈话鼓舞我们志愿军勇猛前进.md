To the Editor:

We are representatives of combat heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home. We were very happy when we read Comrade Stalin's "Answers to the 'Pravda' Correspondent on the Question of Atomic Weapons" in the newspaper.

Last year, as soon as we crossed the Yalu River, the American atomic warmongers clamored arrogantly: "The Korean battlefield is the best place to use atomic weapons," attempting to achieve their aggressive goals through intimidation. But this clamor did not intimidate our Volunteer Army to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country. We drove the invading American army back to the 38th parallel and achieved brilliant victories in several campaigns.

Indeed, "Atomic bombs can only scare those with weak nerves!" We think: In the past year, the bombs dropped by American imperialism on the Korean battlefield have already exceeded the power of dozens of atomic bombs. These bombs have brought enormous disasters to the Korean people, but they have not been able to save American imperialism from its doomed fate.

Comrade Stalin's remarks on the issue of atomic weapons teach us that only by firmly grasping weapons can we make the enemy lay down their weapons. The Soviet Union's testing of atomic weapons is precisely to prohibit the use of atomic weapons, just as our resistance against America and aid to Korea is to defend our homes and country.

Stalin's speech has inspired us. We must advance more bravely and complete the tasks assigned to us by the people of the motherland. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to us, the defenders of peace!

### 斯大林关于原子武器的谈话鼓舞我们志愿军勇猛前进

    斯大林关于原子武器的谈话鼓舞我们志愿军勇猛前进编辑同志：
    我们是志愿军战斗英雄归国代表。我们看了报纸上登载的斯大林同志“关于原子武器问题答真理报记者问”，心里非常高兴。
    去年，我们刚一跨过鸭绿江，美国的原子黩武主义者，曾经狂妄地叫嚣：“朝鲜战场是使用原子武器最好的场所”，企图以恫吓的手段来达到侵略的目的。但这种叫嚣，一点也没有吓倒我们抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿军，我们把侵朝美军一直赶回了“三八”线，取得了数次战役的辉煌胜利。
    真的，“原子弹只能吓唬那些神经脆弱的人！”我们想：一年以来，美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上投下的炸弹，早已超过了数十枚原子弹的威力。这些炸弹，给朝鲜人民带来了巨大的灾难，但并没有能挽救美帝国主义失败的命运。
    斯大林同志关于原子武器问题的谈话教导我们：只有紧握武器，才能使敌人放下武器。苏联试验原子武器，正是为了禁止原子武器的使用，和我们抗美援朝正是为了保家卫国一样。
    斯大林的谈话鼓舞了我们，我们一定要更加勇猛前进，完成祖国人民所交给我们的任务。我们坚信，胜利一定属于我们和平保卫者！
