Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th: According to a Dentsu Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th: A campaign to provide blood transfusions for U.S. troops in Korea is currently being organized in Japan. This is the result of a suggestion made to the Japanese government by Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, after he inspected the Korean front and learned of the heavy casualties among U.S. troops.

Bradley requested that blood donors be selected first from Japanese city residents, especially civil servants, members of the "National Police Reserve," middle school students, and university students. Each blood donor will be assigned to a blood donation station, which is directly established by Ridgway's headquarters.

    侵朝美军伤亡惨重
    美国竟强迫日本人民输血
    【新华社十七日讯】电通社香港十五日讯：东京消息：在日本，目前正在组织为朝鲜美军输血的运动。这是由于美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷在视察朝鲜前线、知道美军的重大伤亡之后向日本政府提出建议的结果。
    布莱德雷要求先由日本城市居民中挑选出输血者，特别是公务员、“国家警察后备队”队员、中小学生及大学生。每个输血者将被指定到一个输血站输血，该站是由李奇微总部直接设立的。
