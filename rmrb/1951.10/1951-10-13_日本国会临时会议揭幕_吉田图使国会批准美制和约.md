    Xinhua News Agency, October 12th, TASS dispatch from October 10th: According to Japanese sources, the 12th Japanese Diet's temporary session opened in Tokyo on the 10th. The Yoshida government intends to use this session to have the Diet approve the separate "peace treaty" and the US-Japan military agreement—the so-called US-Japan "Security Treaty." At the same time, the Yoshida government also intends to submit to the Diet, against the will of the people, a number of reactionary bills, including two bills concerning Japanese war criminals and a bill concerning the prohibition of general strikes, as well as a so-called administrative reform bill and a supplementary budget bill.

    The bill concerning war criminals stipulates the early release (i.e., so-called "parole") of war criminals or the reduction of their sentences, in particular, the early release of major war criminals who are "excessively old" and "unsuitable" for imprisonment. For example, the *Yomiuri Shimbun* said that all major war criminals, especially former Minister of War Sadao Araki and former Prime Minister and President of the Privy Council Kiichirō Hiranuma, belong to this category.

    The bill concerning the prohibition of general strikes is a further measure in the Yoshida government's policy of widespread suppression of the Japanese workers' movement. The bill stipulates that general strikes are prohibited in all the most important industrial sectors, such as transportation, mining, and electricity.

    The so-called administrative reform bill stipulates the dismissal of more than 123,000 civil servants under the pretext of "reform" and "cutting expenses." This "reform" is planned to purge civil servants with democratic sentiments from administrative organs.

    The supplementary budget案 is to further rearm Japan in accordance with the aggressive US-Japan "Security Treaty." The supplementary budget案 stipulates that railway transportation fees and postal rates will be increased from November this year.

    日本国会临时会议揭幕
    吉田图使国会批准美制和约
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社十日讯：据日本消息，日本第十二届国会临时会议已于十日在东京开幕。吉田政府打算在这届会议上使国会批准单独“和约”和美日军事协定——所谓美日《安全条约》。同时，吉田政府还打算在会上违反人民的意志而提请国会考虑许多反动法案，其中有两个关于日本战犯的法案和关于禁止总罢工的法案，以及所谓行政改革的法案和追加预算的法案。
    关于战犯的法案规定把战犯先期释放（按即所谓“假释”）或把他们的刑期缩短，特别是要先期释放“过分衰老”“不宜”禁锢狱中的主要战犯。譬如，《读卖新闻》说，一切主要战犯，首先是前陆相荒木贞夫和前首相、枢密院议长平沼骐一郎，就属于这一类。
    关于禁止总罢工的法案，是吉田政府在广泛镇压日本工人运动的政策方面的进一步措施。该法案规定禁止在运输、采矿、电力等一切最重要的工业部门中进行总罢工。
    关于所谓行政改革的法案，规定在“改革”及“削减开支”的借口下解雇十二万三千名以上的公务员。计划这种“改革”是为了把有民主情绪的公务员清洗出行政机关。
    追加预算案是为了按照侵略性的美日《安全条约》，进一步重新武装日本。追加预算案规定自今年十一月起增加铁路运输费和邮费。
