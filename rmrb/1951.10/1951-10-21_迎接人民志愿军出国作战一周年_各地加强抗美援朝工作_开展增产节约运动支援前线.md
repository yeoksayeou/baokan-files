To greet the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war, various regions are strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign and launching a production increase and thrift campaign to support the front lines.

[Report from this newspaper] The people of various regions are actively greeting the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war in Korea, preparing to celebrate the great victory of the Resist America, Aid Korea war over the past year, and further strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, expand the production increase and thrift movement, and use greater strength to support the Korean front.

After the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea issued its notice on October 13, the general and branch associations to Resist America and Aid Korea in various regions formulated specific measures to celebrate this anniversary based on local conditions. The Inner Mongolia General Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association called on all grassroots units that have established patriotic pacts to use time outside of production, work, and study to check the implementation of the patriotic pacts (including donation plans) and future improvement measures, launch production for disaster relief and thrift campaigns, and strive to pay two-thirds of the weapon donation before the 25th. The Chahar Province Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association called on all municipal and special district branches to summarize the Resist America, Aid Korea work over the past year and formulate plans to further strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work in the future. When checking the implementation of patriotic pacts, appropriate revisions and supplements should be made based on the specific situation of production increases, thrift, and production for disaster relief. The Liaoxi Province Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association called on all memorial meetings and symposiums in various places to commend model figures in all aspects of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, mobilize all the people to continue to strengthen the struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea, and strive for the final victory of Resist America and Aid Korea; and called on to universally check and revise patriotic pacts, promote the production increase and thrift movement, and pay donations as soon as possible. The Subei and Wanbei Branches of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association decided to mobilize people from all walks of life to collectively write letters to the Volunteer Army and their families and the families of martyrs; called for checking patriotic pacts, correcting deviations in the donation movement; combining winter sideline production to formulate production increase and donation plans, expand the production increase and thrift movement, and strive to support the Korean front.

The people of various regions have taken practical actions to greet the anniversary of the Volunteer Army's participation in the war. As of October 10, the people of all walks of life in Shenyang had paid more than 42.957785 billion yuan in donations, completing 75.3 percent of the plan; and striving to pay all donations by the end of this month. Employees in Shenyang City have completed more than 104 percent of their donation plan. The industrial and commercial circles in Xi'an City decided to complete the plan to donate ten aircraft before October 25. The trade union of employees in four industries and shops and the trade unions of the shipping and machinery industries in Nanning City, Guangxi, have overfulfilled the donation plan. The people of Chanan Special District, Chahar Province, the hometown of revolutionary martyr Dong Cunrui, actively developed sideline production under the severe drought and insect plagues, and have now overfulfilled the payment plan for the "Dong Cunrui" fighter jet as a gift to greet the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war. Zhang Fugui's mutual aid group in Liangdi Village, Luanping County, Rehe, reclaimed eight acres of wasteland to donate aircraft and artillery; now, the beans and buckwheat planted on these eight acres of land have all been donated. The mutual aid group of Wu Houli, a labor model in Yangjingdi Village, Pingshun, Shanxi, has also overfulfilled the donation plan for processing, fertilizing, and increasing production; they originally planned to donate 250,000 yuan, but now they have paid 500,000 yuan, and there is still a surplus of increased production income. They recently made a plan to buy new agricultural tools, expand production, and donate for a long time.
