Beijing has only been liberated for two years, but our lives have undergone tremendous changes. Thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership, our school's teacher, Comrade Zheng Yun, was elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal Government, and teacher Tao Shufan was honored as a standing committee member of the National Education Trade Union. Primary school teachers, who had no status in old China, have now turned over a new leaf. Thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership, our school's teacher Gao Zhuguo, who served for more than thirty years, received preferential treatment from the government and retired with a pension. From now on, the danger of hunger, cold, and unemployment for teachers no longer exists in New China. We will never forget all of this!

In the first half of this year, we put forward the slogan of "Being wholeheartedly responsible for the children, improving teaching methods, and striving to reduce and eliminate failing grades." After close cooperation between the administration, the Party, the Youth League, and the Trade Union, and through the efforts of all comrades, among more than 300 students in the third and fourth grades, only five or six students failed in Chinese and Arithmetic. Among the 138 sixth-grade graduates, 122 were admitted to public middle schools according to their first choice.

Since Chairman Mao put forward the call for "Health First," we have also done several things in this area: (1) Strengthened sports equipment and activities; (2) Paid attention to hygiene education and the cultivation of hygiene habits; (3) Tried our best to ensure that the diet meets the needs of children; (4) Streamlined homework so that both learning and physical well-being are improved. In previous years, each class often had five or six students on sick leave, but now it is rare to see many students on sick leave in each class. Only a few students took sick leave last semester.

We must play our due role in the movement to love the motherland and resist America and aid Korea: We must continue to implement the principle of health first and strive to achieve more and greater success in the struggle to eliminate failing grades.

    小学教师政治地位提高，努力改进教学方法，保护学生健康
    北京解放虽只两年，我们的生活却有了极大的改变。由于毛主席的领导，我校教师郑芸同志当选了北京市政府委员，教师陶淑范同志荣膺全国教育工会常务委员，在旧中国没地位的小学教师现在翻身了。由于毛主席的领导，我校服务三十余年的教师高注国，得到了政府的优待，退休养老。从此，教师们饥寒失业的危险在新中国不存在了。这一切，我们是永远忘不掉的！
    今年上半年，我们提出了“全心全意对孩子们负责，改进教学方法，争取减少与消灭不及格现象”的口号。经过行政、党、青年团、工会紧密配合，全体同志努力的结果，在三、四年级三百多个学生中，国语、算术不及格的，只有五、六人了，六年级毕业生一三八人中有一二二人按第一志愿考上了公立中学。
    自从毛主席提出“健康第一”号召以后，我们在这一方面也作了几件工作：（一）加强了体育设备与活动；（二）注意了卫生教育与卫生习惯的培养；
    （三）尽力做到饮食合于儿童需要；（四）精简作业，使学习与身体都好起来。往年每班学生经常都有五、六人请病假，现在每班经常请假的不多见了，上学期请过病假的只不过几个人。
    我们要在爱祖国与抗美援朝运动中，发挥我们应有的作用：我们要在继续贯彻健康第一，争取消灭不及格现象斗争中，做出更多更大的成绩。
