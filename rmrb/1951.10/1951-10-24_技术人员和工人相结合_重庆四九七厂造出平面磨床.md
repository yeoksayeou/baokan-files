Technicians and Workers Combine Efforts
Chongqing No. 497 Factory Manufactures Surface Grinder

To the Editor:

    Chongqing No. 497 Factory successfully trial-manufactured a surface grinder on July 27th of this year. The surface grinder is an indispensable machine tool for manufacturing precision workpieces. In the past, China could not manufacture grinders, and all those used were purchased from abroad. The successful manufacture of the surface grinder is mainly the result of the combination of technicians and workers. During the trial production process, they worked hard to overcome the difficulties of insufficient machine precision and a lack of tools, and successfully solved problems such as the sand casting of large castings. According to test results, the precision of the manufactured surface grinder even exceeds international allowable tolerance standards in some aspects.

    技术人员和工人相结合
    重庆四九七厂造出平面磨床编辑同志：
    重庆四九七厂试造平面磨床，已于今年七月二十七日试验成功。平面磨床是制造精密工件不可缺少的工作母机。过去，我国不能制造磨床，所用都自外国买来。平面磨床所以能够制造成功，主要是由于技术人员与工人结合的结果。在试制过程上，他们努力克服了机器精度不够和工具不足的困难，并圆满解决了大型铸件的翻砂问题等。根据试验成绩，制成之平面磨床的精度，在某些方面甚至超过了国际允许公差的标准。
