Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Telecommunications News Agency reports: American military commentator Werner, in an article in the New York Star on the 15th, commented on the failure of the American "Cold War," stating: "The Cold War has gone too far, and American policy has encountered obstacles because the Cold War has divided and disintegrated Europe." Werner wrote: America's Cold War has split Europe itself. The situation between France and West Germany is becoming increasingly tense, and the English Channel has become a sharp political dividing line, separating Britain from the European continent and from France. Werner continued: "The result of the American Cold War is frightening Britain away from the Western alliance. It is our Cold War that is exhausting France's political energy; it is also our Cold War that is encouraging German neo-fascism, thereby deepening the tension between France and Germany." The article pointed out the contradictions in British foreign policy, saying: Britain cannot simultaneously ally with the United States, implement an active imperial policy, and establish a tightly organized Western European bloc. The article also stated: The five-nation Western alliance of the Brussels Treaty has become an empty scheme, a complete failure. In addition to the inherent contradictions in the Western European alliance plan, the decline of the United States and France's prolonged domestic crisis have rendered America's European policy a fiction.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Various reports: The United States, Britain, and France disagree on several issues concerning West Germany. According to a Telecommunications News Agency dispatch from Berlin, the American military government in Germany was forced on the 19th to announce that the implementation of the West German separatist constitution, formulated under Clay's instructions, had been decided to be "postponed." The statement admitted that the first reason for the postponement was the difficulties that had arisen between Washington, London, and Paris in reaching an agreement on dividing Germany, because France stubbornly resisted the American plan to establish a West German arsenal on the French border. The second reason was that the Western countries disagreed on the scope of power to be granted to the West German separatist government. Since Clay, in July of this year, urged the prime ministers of the West German states with an imploring letter to formulate a "constitution" for dividing Germany, attempting to establish West Germany as a unified anti-Soviet military base, conflicts have continuously arisen between the United States, Britain, and France. In order to maintain the necessary industrial base for this anti-Soviet military base, the United States had requested Britain and France to stop dismantling West German factories; these factories were originally designated as German reparations to Britain and France and were to be dismantled and sent to Britain and France. This matter had caused several public objections between Clay and Conant. Recently, Britain and France have also jointly opposed this American proposal. According to Agence France-Presse, on the 9th of this month, the British and French ambassadors to the United States sent notes to the US government, expressing the opposition of Britain and France to any delay or reduction in the factory dismantling plan. On the 14th, a spokesman for the American military government in West Germany announced that the issue of factory dismantling and delaying German reparations would be submitted to the Marshall Plan Executive Board and the Paris Marshall Plan Conference for handling, in order to coerce Britain and France. The British Foreign Office confirmed on the 24th that Marshall had sent a letter to Bevin, asking Britain to stop dismantling factories in the British-occupied zone of Germany.

　　美英法在西德发生矛盾
    美国“冷战”失败
    【新华社陕北廿八日电】电通社讯：美国军事评论家威尔纳十五日在纽约明星报著文评论美国“冷战”的失败时指出：“冷战走了火，美国政策发生了障碍，因为冷战分裂和瓦解了欧洲。”威尔纳写道：美国的冷战分裂了欧洲本身，法国与西德间的形势正日益紧张，而英伦海峡又成了一道尖锐的政治分界线，把英国从欧洲大陆和从法国隔开。威尔纳接着指出：“美国冷战的结果，正在把英国从西方联盟中吓跑。把法国政治精力耗尽的，是我们的冷战；鼓励德国新法西斯主义，从而加深了法德之间紧张局面的，也是我们的冷战。”该文指出英国外交政策的矛盾时说：英国不能同时既与美国联盟，又实行积极的帝国政策，而且还建立一个组织紧密的西欧集团。该文又称：布鲁塞尔条约的五国西方联盟已成一个空洞的方案，这是一个完全的失败。除了西欧联盟计划原有的矛盾外，美国的走下坡路和法国长期的国内危机，已使美国的对欧政策成为虚构。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】各方报导：美英法三国在有关西德的几个问题上意见分歧。据电通社柏林电称，德境美国军政府十九日被迫宣布，奉克莱指示而制订的西德分裂主义宪法之实行已决定“延期”。声明承认延期的第一个原因是华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎之间在对于获得分割德国的协议上发生了困难，因为法国顽强地反抗美国在法国边境建立西德兵工厂的计划。第二个原因则是西方国家政府，在关于要给予西德分裂政府的权力范围这一问题上，意见不一。自本年七月克莱以哀的美敦书催促西德各州总理制订分裂德国的“宪法”，试图将西部德国建立成为一个统一的反苏军事基地以来，美英法之间即不断发生矛盾。为了使这个反苏军事基地保持必需的工业基础，美国曾要求英法停止拆卸西德的工厂；这些工厂原是规定作为德国对英法的赔偿，而拆卸送到英法本国去的。此事曾引起克莱与柯宁间几次公开的反对。最近英国也和法国共同反对美国这一主张。据法新社讯，本月九日英法两国驻美大使照会美政府，表明英法两国反对任何延缓或减少拆卸工厂的计划。十四日，西德美国军政府发言人又宣布将拆厂及延缓德国赔偿问题提交马歇尔计划执行局及巴黎马歇尔计划会议处理，用以要挟英法两国。英国外交部二十四日证实，马歇尔已致函贝文，要英国停止拆卸德境英占区工厂。
