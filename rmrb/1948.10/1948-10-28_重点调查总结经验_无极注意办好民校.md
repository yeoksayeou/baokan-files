[JiZhong Electric] The Propaganda Department of the Wuji County Party Committee and the Education Section of the County Government, in order to run this year's people's schools (one of the main forms of social education) well, conducted a key investigation and summarized several experiences: (1) To do a good job in people's school work, the leadership must pay attention to it, and provide timely help, supervision, and inspection. For example, the people's school in Xiaochen Village, due to the frequent guidance and praise from the County Party Committee Propaganda Department and the responsible inspection by the Education Committee, has persisted since 1945, enabling more than 300 people to study regularly. (2) Running people's schools requires patience. Coercive orders or simply writing slogans and having a lively radio propaganda campaign will not work. It is necessary to conduct patient education based on the actual needs of the masses and enlighten their desire to learn. For example, in some villages in the Fourth District, old ladies who weave cloth, spin, and sell thread were spending Jinnan currency as border region currency. We seized on this point to strengthen education, so that they could experience the pain of illiteracy from reality. Song Xiaojun of the Dongchiyang Education Committee seized on this point and first developed a reading group of five or six people into twelve or thirteen people. On this basis, the militia, drama troupe, and Communist Youth League were all organized into study groups. (3) Past experience has proven that it is not easy to persist if one does not combine with production and simply calls the masses together for classes. For example, the persistence of the people's school in Zhao Houying Village is mainly combined with their own production. Now it has become a production mutual aid group, making good use of the idle people's time. The leadership first cultivates backbones to read newspapers. In this way, without holding meetings, the number of people listening to the newspaper slowly increases. Li Changhu's farmers' association group in Hucun had eighty people listening to the newspaper, and later divided into three groups. The Li Luoliang study group helps each other in doing business and still persists. (4) Use people's school textbooks as a basis, and teach whatever each person wants to learn, instead of rigidly imposing a set curriculum of your own. For example, the Maqiao Village production study group, according to the opinions of the masses, learns abacus and how to identify fake banknotes. (5) Several issues that need to be resolved: First, during the land reform, some village cadres who were enthusiastic about education were removed from their posts or wrongly classified, and their morale was low. For example, Wang Yinfeng, the director of the Education Committee in Xiaochen Village, opened a pharmacy and went into hiding because his wrongly determined status had not been corrected. Second, the county and district leaders have not yet utilized the various natural gatherings of the masses in rural villages and towns. Third, the expenditure of people's school funds and teaching materials are both very important issues, which the leadership must resolve to ensure a certain level of expenditure and prevent waste.

　　重点调查总结经验
  　无极注意办好民校
    【冀中电】无极县委宣传部和县府教育科，为了把今年民校（社会教育主要形式之一）办好，特做了重点调查，总结出几点经验：（一）民校工作要想搞好，领导上必须重视，及时帮助督促检查，如小陈村的民校，由于县委宣传部经常指导表扬，教委负责检查，自从三十四年一直坚持下来，使三百余人能常学习。（二）办民校必须耐心，强迫命令或光写写标语，广播宣传热闹一阵，不会搞好。要根据群众实际需要，进行耐心教育，启发他的学习要求。如四区有的村织布纺卖线的老太太们，把冀南票当边区票花了，我们就抓住这一点加强教育，使他从实际中体验到不识字的痛苦。东池阳教委宋小俊抓住了这点，先由五六人的读报组，发展成十二三人，在这个基础上把民兵、剧团、青年团都组织为学习小组。（三）过去经验证明，不和生产结合，硬把群众叫到一块上课，不容易坚持下去。如赵后营村民校的坚持，主要是和本人生产结合着，现在又变成生产互助小组，利用好歇闲人的地方，领导上事先培养骨干，进行读报，这样不用开会，听报的人就慢慢多起来。户村李长货的农会小组，听报的到了八十人，后来分成三组。李洛良学习小组，互助做买卖，到现在还坚持着。（四）用民校课本为基础，结合各人愿学什么就教什么，不要自己硬搬一套。如马桥村生产学习小组，根据群众意见，学珠算、认真假票。（五）需要解决的几个问题：一、土改中，有的热心教育的村干部被撤了职，或错订了成份，情绪不高。如小陈村教委王荫丰，因错订成份没纠正，自己开了个药铺隐避起来。二、县区领导上还没把乡村城镇中各种群众的自然场合利用起来。三、民校经费的开支和教材，都是很重要的问题，领导上必须解决，保证一定限度的开支，不能浪费。
