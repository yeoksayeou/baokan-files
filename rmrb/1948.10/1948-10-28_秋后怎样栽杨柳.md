How to Plant Willows and Poplars After Autumn

　　In humid areas, whether using layering or cuttings to plant willows and poplars after autumn, the method is the same as in spring. However, when layering, the branch tips should be exposed as little as possible, and the thicker ends should be buried deep at the bottom of the pit. When using cuttings, it is best to use short cuttings, with the top end level with the ground. This way, even in extremely cold regions, the slips will not freeze to death. Sometimes the tender shoots may dry out a little at the tip, which is not a problem.

　　Now, I will introduce a bow-shaped layering method suitable for drier areas. This was created by the masses in Daying, Fanshi County, Jin Northeast. The area is cold, dry, and has extreme wind and sand. Using this bow-shaped layering method to create poplar and willow windbreaks saves seedlings and results in more and better survival. Some areas in western Hebei also use this method, locally called "pressing small bows," which is ideal for afforestation after autumn. However, the poplar referred to here is the small-leaved poplar, not the large-leaved poplar or the small green poplar, as the latter two cannot be layered.

　　Method: Dig a pit one and a half feet long, seven inches wide, and one and a half to two feet deep (deeper in dry land, shallower in wet land). Bundle two to three two- or three-year-old poplar and willow branches, about four feet long, with the thick ends aligned. Hold one end and bend them into an arch shape, with both ends facing down. Insert them together into the bottom of the pit, with the middle facing upwards, just half an inch lower than the ground. Then, fill the soil and tamp it firmly, so that the back of the arch is just covered by half an inch. In the early spring of the following year, shoots will emerge from the soil.

　　Advantages: (1) The slips pressed using this method have roots at both ends, and buds in the middle, growing into small trees that are thick and strong. (2) The survival rate is very high. Even in dry areas, as long as you master the principle of deep burial, tight tamping, and no exposure, you can achieve a survival rate of over 95%. (3) The slips are completely buried in the soil, preventing a section from drying out. All the essence is used for rooting and sprouting, so the shoots emerge early and with vigor. The newly afforested areas are not susceptible to damage from people and animals. (4) Each slip can grow two or three small trees, which saves seedlings and is very safe. (5) They are not afraid of wind and sand blowing and shaking, and they easily take root, so they are most suitable for creating windbreaks and sand fixation forests in windy and sandy areas. Moreover, after the small trees emerge, they grow more densely, with deep and firm roots, and the wind and sand fixation effect is most significant.

### 秋后怎样栽杨柳

　　秋后怎样栽杨柳
    湿润地方在秋后栽杨柳，无论压条或插杆，方法都跟春天一样，但压条时枝梢要尽可能少露，粗头要深埋在坑底下，插杆最好插短杆，上头和地皮一般高便可以。这样即使在气候极冷的地区，也不会把条子冻死，有时嫩梢可能干一点尖，那是毫不妨事的。
    现在介绍一个适用于较干燥地方的弓形压条法，这是晋东北繁峙县大营一带群众的创造，当地寒冷、干燥、风沙极大，用这个弓形压条法造杨柳树防风林，又省树秧，活的又多又好。冀西有些地方也采用此法，当地叫做“压小弓”，用于秋后造林，最为理想。但这里所说的杨是小叶杨，不是大叶杨和小青杨，后二者不能压条。
    方法：挖长一尺半，宽七寸，深一尺半到二尺（干地深些，湿地浅些）的坑，将两三年生、长四尺左右的杨柳条，两到三根合成一束，粗头对齐，一手拿着一头，弯成弓形，两头朝下，一起插到坑底，当中朝上，恰巧比地面低半寸。然后填土踩实，把弓背刚盖过半寸的样子。第二年早春，便从土中抽出芽条来。
    优点：（１）用这方法压的条，两头扎根，当中出芽条，长成小树，又粗又壮。（２）成活率很高，即使在干燥地方，只要掌握深埋，紧砸，不露的原则，便能活到九成五以上。（３）条子全埋土中，不致干掉一截，全部精液都用于扎根发芽，所以发芽早，劲头足。刚造林时受不到人畜损害。（４）每根条子能长出两三棵小树，既省树秧，又很安全。（５）不怕风沙吹打摇动，容易扎根，所以最宜用于风沙地带造防风防沙林，而且小树出来以后，长得较稠，根深蒂固，防风固沙效果最足。
