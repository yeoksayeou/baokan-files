[Jinzhong Electric] The masses in the new district support the democratic government's autumn grain collection methods and are rushing to grind public grain day and night to support the front. After the Third District of Taiyuan County held a village cadre meeting on September 30 to arrange the autumn grain collection work, the village cadres returned to their villages to convey the message. The masses unanimously supported the government's method of reasonable allocation and tax collection based on acreage with exemptions. The masses in Dongliu Village said, "The democratic government's policy is really detailed, and it can't let some people benefit and others suffer." When the masses in Xiliu Village held a meeting and heard that their village was allocated 120 *xiaoshi* of public grain, they all said, "It's no problem, we can complete it. Even what was wasted by the *gouzi* army (阎匪 army, Yan Xishan Bandit Army) personnel in the villages is more than this." In Xiaohuanggou Village, Eighth District of Shouyang, last year the Yan bandits demanded 700 *shi* of grain from the village, while this year's public grain burden to the democratic government is only 35 *shi*, only one-twentieth of what the enemy forcibly collected. In Zhang Hanhe and Guo Xu's family in the Fourth District, the old man has three people and farms 18 *mu* of land, producing 21 *shi* and 2 *dou* of grain. Everyone discussed and decided that he should contribute 2 *shi* of public grain. He said, "We are fighting Taiyuan, but we are being assigned so little, it's really not a heavy burden." He immediately threshed the millet in preparation for grinding rice. Zhao Rongsiwei, the village chief of Zhao's Village in the Ninth District, and Nie Yaoni, the director of the Women's Federation, returned to the village to mobilize for the autumn grain collection, saying: "This year's autumn grain collection is to finally eliminate Yan Xishan, this is life-saving grain." A plan was made to mobilize the entire village. They started on October 2nd and by the 4th, all the grain had been harvested. Starting from the 5th, they ground rice day and night to ensure that it would be completed by the 8th.

　　太原新区群众赶碾公粮支前
    【晋中电】新区群众拥护民主政府秋征办法，星夜赶碾公粮支援前线。太原县三区九月三十日召开村干部会议，布置秋征工作后，各村干部回村传达，群众对政府合理分配，有免征点的按亩计征办法，同声拥护。东柳村群众说：“民主政府的政策实在详细哩，总不能叫有的便宜有的吃亏。”西柳村群众开会，听了分配本村一百二十小石公粮，都说：“不成问题，可以完成，连勾子军（阎匪军）乡村人员糟踏了的也比这多”。寿阳八区小黄沟村，去年阎匪向该村要粮七百石，而今年给民主政府的公粮负担只三十五石，仅占敌人强征数的二十分之一。四区张韩河、郭旭老汉家里三口人种地十八亩，产粮二十一石二斗，大家评议他出公粮两石，他说：“咱们要打太原却派的这样少，这可真不重呀”。他马上打下谷子准备碾米。九区赵家庄村长荣四维，妇联主任聂耀妮，回村动员秋征说：“今年秋征是最后消灭阎锡山，这是保命粮。”定出计划全村动员，在十月二日动手到四日已将谷全数割完，从五日起星夜碾米，保证八号全数完成。
