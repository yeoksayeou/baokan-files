　　[Jinzhong Telegram] Pingyao County has completed planting over 320,000 mu of wheat fields, accounting for over 39.2% of the total land, an increase of over 29,200 mu compared to the period of Yan's bandit rule last year. The main reasons and experiences for achieving such results are fourfold: (1) Addressing the concerns of various classes regarding land changes and burden issues, widely publicizing the policy of "whoever plants it, harvests it," and incentive production policies such as halving the tax on reclaimed cultivated wasteland next year and exempting tax for one year on reclaimed raw wasteland, stabilized the masses' emotions and shifted them towards active production. The county has eliminated 75% of wasteland, excluding flooded wheat fields that cannot be cultivated. After understanding the government's burden policies and wasteland reclamation incentives, rich peasant Feng Shangnian of Daohubi reclaimed all 20 mu of long-abandoned land and planted winter wheat. Most wheat fields have been fertilized. In Chengnanbao, Fifth District, among 653 mu of wheat fields, the maximum yield per mu is 15 dan, the minimum is 5 dan, with an average of 8 dan per mu. Fertilized land accounts for 85% of the total wheat land. (2) Production committees have been generally established in villages, and most villages have become organs for leading production and resolving land issues and production difficulties after the abolition of the "Binghe" system. In addition to helping landless, land-poor, seed-poor, and livestock-poor families of military personnel, martyrs, and poor farmers solve their difficulties, they also coordinated livestock power for support-the-front carts and civilian laborers, ensuring the wheat was planted. (3) County and district leaders grasped the work tightly, ensuring that both production and support for the front were not neglected. They proposed "planting early and planting fast" early on, so that by the time the civilian laborers were dispatched in large numbers at the beginning of October, over 80% of the wheat fields had already been planted. In addition, they mobilized the masses to voluntarily form mutual aid teams. (4) Mobilizing and launching women, children, and other semi-laborers to participate in production. In the first, second, third, sixth, and eighth districts, over 20,000 women and children participated in tasks such as cutting artemisia, pulling seed drills, reclaiming wasteland, and planting wheat, and many active laborers emerged. Yu Sannv of Dapocun, Second District, is 63 years old this year. She cut artemisia herself and exchanged animal labor to plant 8 mu of wheat land, and also weeded 7 mu of autumn fields. Liangjiabao women's team leader led more than 50 women to reclaim 24 mu of wasteland. Over 2,700 women in 17 villages including Dujiazhuang participated in grinding flour, completing over 4,000 jin of tasks in seven days, saving livestock power for planting wheat.

　　宣传政策解决困难
  　平遥胜利完成种麦
  　消灭荒地百分之七十五
    【晋中电】平遥全县三十二万余亩麦田，业已全部下种，占全部土地的百分之三十九点二强，比去年阎匪统治时期增加麦田二万九千二百余亩。获得如此成绩的主要原因与经验有四：（一）针对各阶层存在的顾虑土地变动和负担问题，广泛宣传谁种谁收，及消灭熟荒明年减征一半，消灭生荒明年免征一年等奖励生产政策，稳定了群众情绪，转向积极生产。全县除无法耕种之水淹地麦地以外，已消灭荒地百分之七十五。道虎壁富农冯尚年，了解政府负担政策和奖励灭荒办法后，将荒芜已久的二十亩地全部消灭，并播种了宿麦。麦田大都上了肥。五区城南堡六五三亩麦田中，每亩最多十五担，最少五担，平均每亩八担。上粪地占总麦地中的百分之八十五。（二）各村普遍建立了生产委员会，大部分村庄并成为领导生产、解决废除“兵合”后调解土地问题和生产困难的机关。他们除帮助无地缺地缺少种籽人畜力的贫苦军工烈属贫苦农民解决困难外，并给前方支差大车民工调剂了畜力，把麦子种上。（三）县区领导上抓的紧，使生产支前两不误。及早提出要“种的早种的快”，因此至十月初民工大批出征时，全部麦田已下种百分之八十以上。此外又发动了群众自愿组合互助变工。（四）动员发动妇女儿童等半劳动力参加生产，一、二、三、六、八五个区，即有两万余妇女儿童参加割蒿、拉耧、灭荒种麦等劳作，并涌现了不少的积极劳动者。二区大坡村余三女今年已六十三岁，自己割了蒿草又变畜工种了八亩麦地，还锄了七亩秋田。梁家堡妇女队长领导五十余妇女开荒二十四亩。杜家庄等十七个村二千七百余妇女，参加了拉磨磨面，七天内完成四千余斤的任务，节省出畜力来种麦。
