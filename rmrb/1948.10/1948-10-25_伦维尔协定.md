　　Renville Agreement
    Question: In the "International Common Knowledge" section of the People's Daily on October 1st, the introduction of the reactionary Hatta government, and in Vyshinsky's speech regarding the Indonesian issue on October 4th, both mentioned the "Renville Agreement." I don't understand what this is about, and several people I asked didn't know either. Please explain.

    Answer: The "Renville Agreement" is a "truce agreement" signed between the Netherlands and Indonesia on January 17th of this year. It was established under the manipulation, oppression of US imperialism and the humiliating surrender of the Indonesian bourgeois right-wing elements. Because this agreement was signed by the Indonesian and Dutch representatives on the American ship "Renville," it is called the "Renville Agreement." The content of this agreement includes "ceasefire on the spot" and "acknowledging the demarcation line of August 29th of last year as the basis for setting up demilitarized zones." The main principles for resolving "political disputes" include: (1) The Kingdom of the Netherlands continues to exercise sovereignty over the territory of the East Indies and establish a "provisional joint government." (2) The "United States of Indonesia" is a "sovereign and independent" country. (3) The Republic of Indonesia is considered a "state" within the "United States of Indonesia." ... This humiliating agreement was unconditionally accepted by the newly established reactionary government at the time—the Hatta government. This agreement and the traitorous Hatta government were immediately met with fierce opposition from Indonesian progressive parties and the people, because the Hatta government, from the day it was established, had the mission of betraying the country and was merely a tool for US-Dutch imperialism to further invade Indonesia.

　　伦维尔协定
    问：人民日报十月一日国际常识中介绍反动的哈达政府，和十月四日所载维辛斯基的演说中关于印尼问题一段，都提到“伦维尔协定”，我不懂是怎么回事，问了几个人都不知道，请解答。

    答：“伦维尔协定”是荷兰与印尼在今年一月十七日所签订的一个“停战协定”，是在美帝国主义的操纵压迫和印尼资产阶级右翼分子的屈辱投降下成立的；因为这个协定是印尼与荷兰代表在美舰“伦维尔”号上签订的，所以叫“伦维尔协定”。这协定的内容，包括“就地停战”，“承认去年八月二十九日之分界线为设置非军事化地区之基础”。其中解决“政治纠纷”的主要原则，有：（一）荷兰王国继续在东印度领土上行使主权，成立“临时联合政府”。（二）“印尼合众国”为“主权独立”国家。（三）印尼共和国算是“印尼合众国”里边的一个“邦”。………这个屈辱的协定，为当时新成立的反动政府——哈达政府无条件接受了。这个协定和卖国贼哈达的政府，立即遭到印尼进步党派和人民的激烈反对，因为哈达政府从成立之日起就是以卖国为使命的，只是美荷帝国主义进一步侵略印尼的工具。
