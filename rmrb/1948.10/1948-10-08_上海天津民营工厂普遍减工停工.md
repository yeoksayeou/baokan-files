Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao news on September 16th and 17th: Private factories in various industries in Shanghai and Tianjin have universally reduced work and stopped work due to the Kuomintang government's "price controls," lack of raw materials, and insufficient costs. Shanghai's woolen textile factories are currently in the autumn and winter season when woolen products should be selling well, and production should be increased. However, due to the inability to purchase wool, the operating rate is less than 50%. The goods produced by rubber product factories are limited in price to only half of the cost, and they cannot purchase raw rubber, so production is only 50% of normal. Knitting factories, dyeing and weaving factories, and most cotton yarn manufacturing factories all feel that cotton yarn is difficult to purchase, and some have only three to five days of raw materials left. Yong'an Textile Company's No. 1 factory stopped work in early September due to the exhaustion of raw materials. According to the Shanghai Electric Power Company's statistics on the total amount of electricity sold in Shanghai, in August, when "price controls" were implemented, the amount of electricity used by industry decreased sharply by 2 million kilowatt-hours compared with July, and there was a continuing downward trend in the first half of September. In Tianjin, the selling price of industrial finished products is far lower than the cost, and the price of imported raw materials has risen by 50% compared with before the "price controls." Most small and medium-sized factories have reduced work. The private cotton textile industry is in a state of being unable to stop work and unable to start work. Even a certain large woolen mill has reduced work by three-fifths due to a lack of raw materials, and night work has completely stopped. Another large factory is preparing to lay off 1,500 people.

　　上海天津民营工厂
    普遍减工停工
    【新华社陕北六日电】据九月十六、七日天津大公报消息：上海及天津各业民营工厂由于国民党政府的“限价”，缺乏原料与不敷成本，已普遍减工、停工。上海毛绒纺织厂在目前正值毛织品起销的秋冬季节，生产理应增进，但因无法买进羊毛，开工不足五成。橡胶制品工厂所产货物，限价仅达成本之半，又不能购入生橡胶，生产亦仅及平时的五成。针织厂、染织厂及大部分棉纱制造厂均感棉纱购买困难，原料有仅存三、五天者。永安纺织公司第一厂因原料用尽，已于九月初停工。据上海电力公司统计沪市售电总量，在实行“限价”的八月份，由于工业用电量减少，也较七月份剧减二百万度，九月份上半月尚有续跌趋势。天津工业成品售价远低于成本，进口原料价格已较“限价”前上涨百分之五十。中小工厂多已减工。民营棉纺织业则在停工不得、开工不能的状态中。甚至某大毛织厂亦因原料缺乏，已减工五分之三，夜工已完全停止。另一大工厂则准备裁员一千五百人。
