　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th: During the Jinan Campaign, the staff of a certain field hospital in East China demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm. Before the battle, the hospital made comprehensive work arrangements, emphasizing obedience to orders and commands. They aimed to improve efficiency and bring tenacity and persistence to their work. In medical work, two stations were set up: receiving and transferring, and medical treatment. The receiving and transferring station emphasized detailed examination of the wounded and their classification for transfer; the medical station had an operating room to rescue the seriously wounded and strengthen post-operative care. In administrative work, strict implementation of the system was emphasized, and a wounded soldiers' food management committee was established to improve the food for the wounded. After a mobilization meeting, the entire hospital launched a competition and worked intensely. Eighteen staff members of the hospital were ill, but all but one participated in the work while ill. In addition to washing bloody clothes every day, the laundry team automatically helped in the dressing room and wards in the evening. Zhang Dewu, the nursing squad leader of the surgical team, worked the night shift and still took care of the wounded during the day. One day he fell ill, but after only two or three hours of sleep, he got up and continued working. The group in the surgical team responsible for head injuries never left the ward and cared for the patients patiently day and night. One day, it rained and the weather suddenly turned cold, and the staff of this team took out their own quilts to cover the wounded.

　　解放济南战役中某野战医院工作人员表现了高度工作热情
    【新华社华东前线十七日电】在解放济南战役中，华东某野战医院工作人员表现了高度的工作热情。战役前该院作全面工作布置时，强调服从命令，听从指挥。提高效率，发挥工作中的顽强性与持久性。在医疗工作上，分设收转、医疗两个站。收转站强调详细检查伤员、分类辨别转运；医疗站间设手术室，以抢救重伤并加强手术后的护理。在行政工作上，强调严格执行制度，并建立伤员伙食管理委员会，以改善伤员火食。经过动员大会之后，全院即展开竞赛，紧张进行工作。该院工作人员中有十八个病号，除一人外其余均带病参加工作。洗衣班除每天完成洗血衣外，晚间自动帮助敷料室及病房工作。手术队护理班长张德戊晚上值夜班，白天仍照顾伤员。有一天他病了，只睡了两三个钟点便起来继续工作。手术队负责头部伤的小组，时刻都不离病房，日夜耐心护理。某日适值天雨，气候骤寒，该队工作人员纷纷拿出自己的被子给伤员盖。
