　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, London, 11th: The second annual meeting of the British-Soviet Friendship Association concluded in London on October 10th. A total of 349 delegates attended, representing 62 local branches of the association, 5 trade unions, 21 trade union committees, more than 80 local trade union organizations, and several cooperatives. The meeting discussed the National Executive Committee's report on the association's work last year and future work plans. The meeting unanimously passed a proposal put forward by Professor Levy, which expressed deep concern about the impact of the deteriorating British-Soviet relations on universal peace and the recovery of the British economy. It demanded that the government agree to the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately reduce armaments by one-third, ban atomic bombs, and establish international control and supervision for this purpose. The proposal also called on the government to resume direct negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question and to pursue a policy aimed at German unification.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: The British people continue to expand the movement to defend peace. According to a Reuter's dispatch from London: Several British towns held rallies on the 10th to strive for peace. A larger peace conference will be held in Trafalgar Square in London in mid-November. This conference will be the culmination of the British people's movement to oppose the Western imperialists' anti-peace provocations in Paris and to strive for the acceptance of the Soviet Union's disarmament and ban on atomic bombs proposals. In Aberdeen, a conscription meeting jointly held by Labor and Conservative members of Parliament had to be adjourned due to opposition from the audience. The audience shouted slogans of peace and British-Soviet friendship and distributed leaflets from the balcony opposing "fighting for America." In Leeds, a local armed forces exhibition held by the government to promote the conscription movement was deserted due to the British Communist Party leading an anti-war rally outside the exhibition hall. Many veterans expressed to Reuter's reporters that they firmly opposed policies leading to war. African veteran Krome said, "I have never fought against working people for the rich of Wall Street." Burmese veteran Glass said, "The newspapers are promoting that we should go to war, I don't support it."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Reuter's: The British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, commented on Churchill's war-mongering at the Conservative Party conference on the 9th, saying that the British people, like the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, will not be surprised by the war-mongering of the warmonger Churchill. If the warmongers dare to organize a new armed anti-Eastern European movement, "they will suffer the same blows as they did twenty-six years ago." The Liberal Party's News Chronicle reported that Conservatives were very worried about Churchill's speech. The newspaper quoted a Conservative as saying, "This speech has damaged the Conservative Party." Churchill's clamor that war may occur due to the Berlin crisis even caused dissatisfaction within the Labor cabinet. According to an Associated Press report, Health Minister Bevan called Churchill a "rash speaker," and Army Minister Shinwell called Churchill a "dangerous element threatening peace."

　　英人民保卫和平运动继续扩展
  　要求政府接受苏裁军建议
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社伦敦十一日讯：英苏友谊协会第二届年会已于十月十日在伦敦闭幕。与会之代表共三四九名，代表该协会之六十二个地方分会、五个职工会、二十一个职工委员会、八十多个职工会地方组织及若干合作社。会议讨论了全国执委会关于该协会去年工作的报告及将来的工作计划。会议一致通过了烈维教授提出的提案，该提案对于英苏关系恶化给予普遍和平及英国经济恢复的影响深为关怀，要求政府同意苏联立即缩减军备三分之一、禁止原子弹并为此建立国际管制监督的建议。该提案又要求政府恢复与苏联直接谈判德国问题并奉行以德国统一为目的之政策。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】英国人民继续扩展保卫和平的运动。据电通社伦敦电称：英国若干城镇曾于十日举行争取和平的集会。更大的和平大会将于十一月中旬在伦敦的特拉法加广场举行。这一会议将成为英国人民反对西方帝国主义在巴黎的反和平挑衅、争取接受苏联裁军与禁止原子弹建议的运动的顶点。在艾伯丁，工党与保守党议员共同举行的征兵大会，由于听众的反对，不得不宣告散会。听众高呼和平英苏友好的口号并从阳台上散发反对“为美国作战”的传单。在里子，政府为宣传征兵运动而举行的地方武装展览会，由于英共在展览会门外领导举行反战大会，参观者甚为冷落。不少退伍军人均向电通社记者表示：他们坚决反对导向战争的政策。非洲退伍军人克罗米说：“我不曾为了华尔街富豪而与劳动人民作战”。缅甸退伍军人格拉斯说：“报纸正在宣传叫我们去参加战争，我不支持它。”
    【新华社陕北十七日电】电通社讯：英共机关报工人日报于十二日评论邱吉尔九日在保守党大会上的战争叫嚣称：英国人民与苏联及东欧各国人民一样，对战争贩子邱吉尔的战争叫嚣，将不感惊奇。如果战争贩子竟敢组织一次新的武装反东欧运动的话，“他们将遭到与二十十六年前同样的打击”。自由党的新闻纪事报报导：保守党人很担心邱吉尔的演说。该报引一保守党人的话说：“这演说使保守党蒙受了损害”。邱吉尔谓战争可能因柏林危机而发生喧嚣，甚至也引起工党内阁中的不满，据美联社消息，卫生部长比万称邱吉尔为“莽撞的演说者”，陆军部长辛威尔谓邱吉尔为“威胁和平的危险分子”。
