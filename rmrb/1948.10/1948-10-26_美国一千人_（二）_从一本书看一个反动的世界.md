"One Thousand Americans" (II)
    --A Reactionary World Seen from a Book
    By Saqiyiwa, Translated by Guan Mengjue
    III. They Once Armed Hitler's Germany

    The title of Chapter XI of Serdy's original book is "Big Industry in War." It reveals how the policies of the monopoly groups favored German imperialism. Serdy cites documents and materials from the parliamentary committee to reveal the business and financial ties, such as cartel agreements, between major American wealthy companies—Aluminum Company of America, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and Mobil Oil—and German trusts.

    Buried in the Senate's investigation reports are countless materials showing the defective aircraft engines of Curtiss-Wright Corporation, the defective wires of Anaconda Company, and the defective bullets of American Cartridge Company, and exposing many bribery and corruption acts of the war industry tycoons.

    "It is no exaggeration to say that this situation is more filthy, more criminal, and more rebellious than the following two large and small secret agreements in the past: according to the small secret agreement, for every fuze used by the British Vickers grenade factory (meaning for every grenade made—translator), the German Krupp armaments factory would share one shilling; according to the large secret agreement, certain supplies were first shipped from the United States to Denmark, and then transshipped to Germany with the acquiescence of the British Admiralty" (page 143).

    The entire American war industry was controlled by a few monopoly groups similar to these. Most of the hundreds of billions of dollars of war budget was allocated to eighty-three companies.

    William Allen White, the editor of the "Market Gazette," whom Serdy called "one of the most loyal editors in America," visited Washington in May 1943 and described in his newspaper how he trembled when he discovered that powerful large companies were "serving both sides of the battle line." White was deeply indignant at the illegal activities of the monopoly groups using the war to seek personal gain, and he wrote:

    "These international combinations of industrial capital are like ferocious cave dwellers, possessing enormous power but no social conscience. They are like an ancient Silurian reptile, wandering in our present, somewhat Christian civilized world—when we thought the imagined dragons had died out, they appear like modern dragons."

    Serdy further strongly criticized White's comment, saying that although White was the most courageous editor and publisher in America, he did not name these cave dwellers and Silurian reptiles.

    Serdy named them—the chairmen, general managers, shareholders, etc. of those companies, as well as their representatives in Congress, in the press, and in reactionary fascist organizations.

    He designated the DuPont family as the top, believing that the DuPont family is the most powerful capitalist dynasty in America today. They (referring to the DuPont family—translator) are the new generation of arms dealers.

    During World War I, DuPont Company was affiliated with the International Explosives Cartel, which at that time included a total of five or six companies. In World War II, the DuPont Group was the American member of the alliance of the three major chemical companies that divided the world. In addition, Imperial Chemical Industries was the British member, and Farben was the German member. As we know, it was Farben that cultivated Hitler and encouraged German imperialism to conquer the world.

    The documents cited by Serdy reveal that DuPont Company was one of many American companies that generously funded German imperialism. It was with their assistance that Germany recovered after its defeat in World War I. The activities of the DuPont Group were closely linked to the then Secretary of Commerce, later U.S. President Hoover. Coincidentally, the DuPont Group funded Hoover's campaign. The DuPont Group and other American arms manufacturers took active measures to sabotage disarmament after World War I.

    The reason why American monopoly groups helped German imperialism make a comeback was because they believed it was the most convenient weapon against democratic forces worldwide, first and foremost against the Soviet Union.

    The documents exposing the role of Hoover and DuPont Company in arming Hitler's Germany are of particular interest because these documents help us understand the activities of the American industrialists and politicians who dominate American policy towards Germany today.

    On February 1, 1933, Felix DuPont signed a contract with a Hitler agent, who at that time went by the alias of Gila, but in reality, he was the international spy Brenner. With Brenner's help, DuPont Company smuggled weapons and military supplies to Hitler through the Netherlands because this could not be done legally at the time. The "business letters" regarding this matter discussed the techniques of smuggling, that is, transporting guns and cannons into Germany along the inland rivers of the Netherlands, regardless of the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. Lamont DuPont notified Harry McGowan of Imperial Chemical Industries of this matter (he later became a nobleman).

    The entire story of the DuPont Cartel's collusion with the Nazis is found in the records of the U.S. Congressional Military Committee in 1944. The record states that DuPont Company and Farben had concluded a gentleman's agreement, the content of which stipulated that each party would give the other priority in new manufacturing methods and new products. Documents prove that when the war began, the American member of the alliance of the three major chemical companies (referring to DuPont Company—translator) promised its Nazi member (referring to Farben—translator) that regardless of who won the war, they would restore the past contracts and gentleman's agreements. It may be determined that after the war, Farben had already established an agreement with DuPont Company and Imperial Chemical Industries, for example, to restore the past cartel agreement on the issue of dividing the South American market. Mobil Oil, Morgan Company, and many other companies also formed similar secret pacts and agreements.

    The DuPont Group also helped to arm Japanese imperialists. They had concluded a cartel agreement with the Japanese Mitsui Company. In 1932, Mitsui Company paid the DuPont Group US$900,000 to purchase an explosive compound.

    The heads of DuPont Company and their countless agents and partners are listed in the list of figures who support American reactionary and fascist organizations. The DuPont family is among the financial tycoons who dominate the National Association of Manufacturers.

    IV. The General Staff of American Reactionaries

    The National Association of Manufacturers can be said to be the general staff of major American wealthy companies. According to Serdy, if it is not the only most powerful economic and political force in America, it is one of the most powerful economic and political forces. On the surface, it represents its 16,000 members; in reality, it is controlled by 207 companies, and these 207 companies are controlled by the aforementioned twelve wealthy companies.

    The general staff of this financial oligarchy determines all of America's domestic policies. The representatives of the twelve major companies hold informal talks and decide on a program of action, then send their resolutions to the leading organs of the National Association of Manufacturers, and then transfer them from there to organizations and companies across the country.

    The National Association of Manufacturers spends three to five million dollars on propaganda every year, using newspapers, radio, movies, schools, churches, and farmers' organizations. This propaganda penetrates public, economic, and political life, leaving no gaps. Its basic purpose is to conceal the selfish, anti-people purposes and plans of the financial oligarchs. It casually uses any Americanism, the American way of life, and American democracy slogans. In recent years, it has emphasized shouting about America's "free enterprise" system to oppose socialism, and oppose the Soviet social and economic system.

    The National Association of Manufacturers is the general staff of American reactionaries. Its upper-level leaders are a few large, viciously reactionary industrial and financial tycoons, including members of the Pew family and Sloan, the general manager of General Motors.

    Serdy particularly emphasizes the activities of the National Association of Manufacturers, the entire purpose of which is to oppose social progress, labor organizations, and anything that threatens the complete rule of the financial oligarchs.

    In recent years, the efforts of the National Association of Manufacturers have focused on abolishing the progressive labor laws enacted during the Roosevelt era. According to Serdy, the Roosevelt era was one of the few short periods in American history when the enactment of laws consciously followed the "general welfare" clause in the Constitution.

    As an eloquent example of the activities of the National Association of Manufacturers, Serdy cites the famous Taft-Hartley Act, saying that the bill was drafted by the National Association of Manufacturers and forced through Congress by its parliamentary lobbyists.

    The National Association of Manufacturers and its combined companies have spent large sums of money on elections. There is indeed a group of "representatives of the people" in Congress who are actually mercenaries of the financial oligarchy groups. In addition, the National Association of Manufacturers also keeps a large group of highly paid parliamentary lobbyists in Washington, who use bribery and oppression to help promote or block the passage of bills. They have a large amount of funds on hand and are in fact an invisible government in Washington, acting in accordance with the instructions of the financial oligarchs. Lobbying is a special contribution of the United States to the parliamentary democratic system. It is widely relied upon by major monopoly companies to carry out their secret dictatorship over the legislature.

    In fact, all American newspapers obey the general staff of American reactionaries. According to Serdy's estimate, at least 90 percent of American newspapers are responding to the "party line" of the twelve wealthy companies. This includes no less than 50 million newspapers and 100 million magazines.

    The National Association of Manufacturers funds and supports many American fascist and semi-fascist groups. In Serdy's book, a special chapter is devoted to discussing American fascism. At present, there are still differing opinions among progressive people in the United States as to whether fascism represents a real threat to the United States. Serdy believes that reactionary forces and fascism pose a real threat to the United States because they have the power of the financial oligarchs behind them. But this issue, as well as the role of newspapers as a means of power for monopoly groups, deserves further discussion.

　　“美国一千人”（二）
    ——从一本书看一个反动的世界
    萨基伊瓦著  关梦觉译
    三、它们曾武装了希特勒德国
    赛尔底斯原书第十一章标题为“战争中的大产业”。它揭露了独占集团的政策曾如何偏向于德国帝国主义。赛尔底斯引证议会委员会的文献和材料，去揭露美国各大富豪公司——铝业公司、伯利亨钢铁公司、克利斯勒公司、福特汽车公司、美孚石油公司——与德国托拉斯之间的业务及财政联结如卡特尔协定。
    在参院的调查报告中，埋藏着无数的材料去表明库蒂斯莱特公司之有瑕疵的飞机引擎、安那康达公司之有瑕疵的电线、美国卡特莱基公司之有瑕疵的子弹，并暴露了战争工业大亨们许多贿赂和腐败的行为。
    “可以毫不夸张地说，这种情形较之过去下列两种大小密约还更污秽、更犯罪、更叛逆：根据小密约，英国维克斯手榴弹工厂每用去一个信管（意指每造一个手榴弹——译者），德国克虏伯兵工厂即分肥一个先令；根据大密约，某些供应品曾先由美国航运到丹麦，再在英国海军部的默许之下转运到德国”（第一四三页）。
    美国全部战争工业都掌握在与此类似的少数独占集团之手。千百亿美元的战争预算的大部分，曾被分配与八十三个公司。
    赛尔底斯所称“美国少数最忠实的编辑之一”的“市场公报”的编辑威廉·亚伦·怀特，于一九四三年五月访问华盛顿之后，曾在他的报纸上描写道，当他发现有势力的各大公司“为双方战线服务”时，他是如何的颤抖。怀特对于各独占集团利用战争以谋其个人发财的不法行为，深为愤慨，他写道：
    “这些产业资本的国际联合，恰似凶恶的穴居动物，拥有巨大的权力而无社会头脑。他们有如一个古代志留纪的爬虫，徘徊于我们这个现时的多少是基督教的文明世界——当想象龙已死灭的时候，它们却象现代的巨龙。”
    赛尔底斯进一步对于怀特的这一评论严加指摘，他说怀特虽然是美国最勇敢的编辑与出版家，但他竟没有举出来这些穴居野人和志留纪爬虫的名字。
    赛尔底斯则举出来他们的名字——那些公司的董事长、总经理、股东等，以及他们在议会、在新闻界、在反动的法西斯组织中的代表。
    他指定杜邦家族占首席地位，他认为杜邦家族是今日美国资本主义王朝中最有势力的一个。他们（指杜邦家族——译者）是军火商人新的一代。
    在第一次世界大战时，杜邦公司曾隶属于国际炸药卡特尔，当时该卡特尔一共包括五个或六个公司。在第二次世界大战中，杜邦集团曾是瓜分世界的三大化学公司联盟的美国会员。此外，帝国化学公司是英国的会员，法尔本公司是德国的会员。如我们所知道的，正是法尔本公司，曾培养了希特勒并鼓舞德帝国主义征服世界。
    赛尔底斯所引证的文件，揭发了杜邦公司曾是慷慨资助德帝国主义的许多美国公司中的一个。正是在他们的援助之下，德国于第一次世界大战溃败以后，才恢复起来。杜邦集团的活动会与当时的商务部长、即后来美国大总统胡佛、有密切联系。很巧合地，杜邦集团曾资助了胡佛的竞选。杜邦集团及其他美国军火制造者，对于第一次大战以后的解除军备，曾探取积极的手段以从事怠工。
    美国各独占集团之所以帮助德帝国主义使之卷土重来，乃是因为它们认为它是反对全世界民主势力、首先是反对苏联的最方便的武器。
    揭露胡佛及杜邦公司在武装希特勒德国中所起作用的文件，其所以具有特别的兴趣，乃是因为这些文件曾帮助我们去了解今天支配美国对德政策的美国实业家和政治家集团的活动。
    一九三三年二月一日，菲利克斯·杜邦曾和一个希特勒代理人签订了一个合同，当时这位代理人化名为吉拉，实际上，他是国际间谍勃伦纳。在勃伦纳的帮助之下，杜邦公司曾通过荷兰，偷运武器和军用品以供给希特勒，因为当时这还不能合法进行。关于此事的“营业信”中曾讨论过偷运的技术，即不顾凡尔赛条约的限制，把枪炮顺荷兰的内河运入德国。拉懋特·杜邦曾把此事通知英帝国化学公司的哈利·麦克高宛（后来他成为贵族）。
    杜邦卡特尔与纳粹私通的全部情节俱见于一九四四年美国议会军事委员会的记录中。该纪录叙述杜邦公司和法尔本公司曾缔结一个绅士协定，其内容规定彼此在新制造方法和新产品上，予对方以优先选择之权。文件证明当战争开始时，三大化学公司联盟的美国会员（指杜邦公司——译者）曾承诺其纳粹会员（指法尔本公司——译者）于战后不管何方获胜，它们将恢复过去的契约和绅士协定。兹不妨确定，战后法尔本公司业已和杜邦公司及英帝国化学公司成立了一个协定，例如，就瓜分南美市场问题，恢复了过去的卡特尔协定。美孚石油公司、摩根公司、以及许多其他公司，也成立了类似的密约与协定。
    杜邦集团也曾帮助去武装日本帝国主义者。它们曾和日本三井公司缔结过一个卡特尔协定。一九三二年，三井公司曾为了收买一个炸药化合式而支给杜邦集团九十万美元。
    杜邦公司的首脑们及其无数的代理人和伙伴们，都列名于那些支持美国反动、法西斯组织的人物一览表中。杜邦家族则侧身于那些支配全国制造家协会的金融大亨之林。
    四、美国反动派的参谋本部
    全国制造家协会可以说是美国各大富豪公司的参谋本部。依照赛尔底斯的说法，假如它不是美国唯一最有权势的经济、政治力量，也是最有权势的经济、政治力量之一。表面上，它代表其一万六千个会员；实际上，它是被二○七家公司所操纵着，而这二○七家公司则由前述的十二家富豪公司所操纵着的。
    这一金融寡头的参谋本部决定美国全部的内政政策。十二家大公司的代表们每进行非正式的会谈并决定一个行动纲领，于是把他们的决议送交全国制造家协会的领导机关，然后即从那里转达遍布全国的组织和公司。
    全国制造家协会每年要化费三百万到五百万美元于宣传方面，它利用报纸、无线电、电影、学校、教会、以及农民组织。这种宣传渗入公共的、经济的、和政治的生活，无孔不入。它的基本目的就是要掩饰金融寡头们的自私的、反人民的目的和计划。它随便应用什么美国主义、美国的生活方式、以及美国的民主等项叫嚣。近年来它更着重去叫嚣美国的“自由企业”制度，以对抗社会主义，对抗苏维埃的社会和经济制度。
    全国制造家协会是美国反动派的参谋本部。它的上层领袖是少数大的、凶恶反动的产业和金融大亨，包括皮氏家族的分子和通用汽车公司总经理斯隆。
    赛尔底斯特别加重提出全国制造家协会的活动，其全部目的乃在于反对社会进步、劳工组织，并反对足以威胁金融寡头的完整统治的任何事物。
    近年来，全国制造家协会的努力集中于废除罗斯福时代所制定的进步的劳工法律，据赛尔底斯说，罗斯福时代曾是美国历史上少有的短时期之一，当时制定法律曾是有意识地遵照宪法中“一般福利”条款的。
    作为全国制造家协会活动的一个雄辩的例证，赛尔底斯引证了著名的塔虎特——哈特莱法案，他说该法案是由全国制造家协会所起草的，并由其议员运动者强迫议会通过的。
    全国制造家协会及其互相结合的公司，曾花费了大批金钱于选举上面。议会中正经有一批“人民的代表”，实际上是金融寡头集团的佣工。此外，全国制造家协会还在华盛顿豢养了一大群待遇优厚的议员运动者，他们用贿赂和压迫，帮助去推动或阻止法案的通过。他们手头有大批的资金，事实上是华盛顿的一个看不见的政府，遵照金融寡头的指令办事。运动议员，是美国对于议会民主制度的一个特殊的贡献。它被各大独占公司所广泛的倚重着，以执行其对于立法机关的秘密独裁。
    实际上，美国全部报纸对于美国反动派参谋本部，无不唯命是从。据赛尔底斯估计，至少有百分之九十的美国报纸都在响应着十二家富豪公司的“党的路线”。这包括不太少于五千万份报纸和一万万份杂志。
    全国制造家协会资助并支持许多美国的法西斯和半法西斯团体。在赛尔底斯的书中，曾专辟一章去讨论美国的法西斯主义。在目前，法西斯主义对于美国是否代表一个真正的威胁，在美国的进步人士中间，还有意见分岐。赛尔底斯则相信反动势力和法西斯主义对于美国构成一个真正的威胁，因为它们有金融寡头的力量为之后盾。但这个问题，以及报纸作为独占集团的权力手段所起的作用，都值得另行讨论。
