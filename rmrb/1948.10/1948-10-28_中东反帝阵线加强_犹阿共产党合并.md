　　Strengthening of the Anti-Imperialist Front in the Middle East
  　Merger of Jewish and Arab Communist Parties
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th – Electone Agency Cairo reported that the Jewish Communist Party and the Arab Communist Party have merged to form the "Communist Party of Israel," with its headquarters in Haifa. The merger of the Jewish and Arab Communist Parties has strengthened the forces of the anti-imperialist front in the Middle East. This is a powerful blow to the conspiracy of American and British imperialism to incite the Jewish and Arab nationalities to continue fighting. According to news from Paris, the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, under the instigation of the United States and Britain, suddenly passed a motion on the 20th to postpone indefinitely the debate on the Palestine issue. The Soviet Union and the new democratic countries all voted against it. According to Electone Agency, the passage of this motion clearly proves that the United States and Britain are unwilling to stop the new war in Palestine. They clearly believe that this is necessary to disrupt the anti-imperialist front in the Middle East, which has been strengthened by the merger of the Jewish and Arab Communist Parties.

　　中东反帝阵线加强
  　犹阿共产党合并
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】电通社开罗讯，犹太共产党与阿拉伯共产党已合并为“以色列共产党”，总部设于海法。犹阿两共产党的合并，已使中东反帝国主义阵线的力量加强。这对于美英帝国主义煽动犹阿两民族继续作战的阴谋，是一个有力的打击。据巴黎消息，联大政治安全委员会在美英策动下已于二十日忽然通过无限期展缓巴勒斯坦问题辩论的议案。苏联及新民主国家均投反对票。据电通社揭露，这一议案的通过，明显地证明美英不愿停止巴勒斯坦的新战争。它们显然认为这是搅乱由于犹阿两共合并而业已加强的中东反帝阵线所必需的。
