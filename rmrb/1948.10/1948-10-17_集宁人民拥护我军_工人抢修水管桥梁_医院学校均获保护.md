Xinhua News Agency, Sui-Meng Front, 15th. The people of Fengzhen and Jining in eastern Suiyuan, long occupied by Fu Zuoyi, expressed warm support for the People's Liberation Army entering the city. Workers, disregarding the heavy rain at the end of the war and the subsequent enemy bombing, enthusiastically assisted in the restoration work. More than 500 workers of the Ping-Sui Railway rushed to repair water pipes and bridges immediately after the battle ended, helping the People's Liberation Army transport their spoils. 193 automobile workers signed up to request to participate in the work. Employees of other public factories sent representatives to report to the People's Liberation Army the locations where Fu's bandits had buried machinery. The county hospital and the Catholic Church hospital, due to the deliberate protection of the People's Liberation Army, suffered no damage except for slight damage to the glass windows of the county hospital due to the shock. Doctors and nurses in both hospitals actively participated in the rescue work. The private middle school established by the Catholic Church resumed classes after the People's Liberation Army entered the city. The school's principal, Pang Xiuren, expressed his gratitude to the People's Liberation Army for their protection. More than 200 teachers and students from the Provincial Jining Middle School thanked the People's Liberation Army for saving them. They said: When the fighting was intense, Fu Zuoyi's bandit army even attempted to force them to serve as cannon fodder, surrounding the school and threatening the students to line up. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army immediately attacked the city at this time.

　　集宁人民拥护我军
  　工人抢修水管桥梁·医院学校均获保护
    【新华社绥蒙前线十五日电】傅作义长期侵占的绥东丰镇集宁的人民，对入城的解放军表示热烈拥护。工人们不顾战争结束时的大雨和随之而来的敌机轰炸，踊跃地协助恢复工作。平绥铁路工人五百余在战斗刚结束就抢修水管、桥梁，帮助解放军运送胜利品。汽车工人报名要求参加工作的达一百九十三人。其他公营工厂的职工派代表找解放军报告傅匪埋藏机器的地点。县立医院和天主堂医院，由于解放军的加意保护，除县立医院玻璃窗略有震坏外，均未受任何损失。两医院的医生和护士积极地参加了救护工作。天主堂所设的私立中学，在解放军入城后即恢复上课。该校校长庞秀仁特向解放军的保护表示感谢。省立集宁中学师生二百余人都感谢解放军救了他们。他们说：当打得正紧时，傅作义匪军竟企图强迫他们去当炮灰，包围学校威胁学生站队，幸好此时解放军即攻入城内。
