North Yue Telegram: In early September, the local Party committees successively convened expanded cadre meetings, where all participating cadres underwent ideological self-criticism, examining the phenomena of a lack of organization and discipline. There was a unanimous feeling that this tendency had caused significant damage to revolutionary work, and a determination to correct it in future work. The self-criticism correctly utilized criticism and self-criticism, paying particular attention to starting from the study of facts and avoiding broad accusations. For those who were ideologically unclear or temporarily unwilling to admit their mistakes, individual conversations were used to help them reflect, and time was given for continued consideration. They were encouraged to think it over and then talk again, prompting their awakening. This made it easier for people to be convinced. Most of the participating cadres exposed their shortcomings and mistakes in work and personal matters. The examination of the manifestations of lack of organization, discipline, and anarchism was particularly thorough. The Lingshou and Huolu County Party Committees both examined their erroneous behavior of creating new policies and arbitrarily determining policies. The Lingshou County Party Committee had independently decided that "for wealthy middle peasants with particularly large amounts of floating wealth, it can be moved if they agree." When implementing the policy of correcting deviations, the First District Committee wrote to the County Party Committee saying, "Correcting the infringement on middle peasants is a compromising method." The County Party Committee did not correct this erroneous understanding but adopted a tacit attitude. When the Huolu County Party Committee saw the Central Bureau's instructions on the issue of class designation and the two documents from 1933, fearing that too few landlords and rich peasants would be designated and the demands of the poor and landless peasants would not be met, they made another decision, reducing the line separating rich peasants from wealthy middle peasants from 25% of the total income from exploitation (as stipulated by the Central Committee, it should be 25% - editor) to 10%. They also separately stipulated that exploitation accounting for 50% of the total income would be the line distinguishing landlords and rich peasants. On the issue of industrial and commercial policy, the County Party Committee of that county decided: "In old areas, those landlords and rich peasants who transferred assets to industry and commerce after the May 4th Directive should have them taken out; in border areas, those landlords and rich peasants who transferred assets to industry and commerce after the Zhengtai Campaign should have them taken out; in new areas, those landlords and rich peasants who transferred assets to industry and commerce after the liberation of Shijiazhuang should have them taken out." They also stipulated methods such as "Landlords and rich peasants in towns and cities who rent out houses and shops should have them taken over by the public"... these are the roots of future policy deviations. The Jianping County Party Committee examined that they reported more work directly to the Central Bureau and less to the local Party committee, and even failed to convey the contents of the June District Party Committee meeting. There were also many instances of making decisions without asking for instructions from higher authorities and "reporting after the fact." For example, when Comrade Yan Zhichao of Fuping went to the Fifth District, he independently distributed 1,000 jin of disaster relief grain. The Fourth District of Mancheng also had actions of privately increasing public grain to solve the difficulties of military dependents. Counties such as Pingshan, Huolu, and Lingshou all had phenomena of privately disbursing public grain and spending money at will without approval. The manifestation of Comrade Wang Meishan, the Armed Forces Minister of Huolu County, pursuing independence and refusing to accept the tasks of the Party was even more serious. The course of events was as follows: During the Jinzhong Campaign, the ammunition transport was very urgent. At that time, the Weishui Bridge was washed away by the water, and there was no time to go through the formalities of mobilizing service. The North China Ordnance Depot specially sent an instructor to consult with the County Party Committee and County Magistrate of that county to mobilize carts. Because they had not brought the mobilization formalities, they gave many reasons and requested accommodation, and guaranteed to make it up later. After consideration by the County Party Committee, they thought it was possible. After talking with Wang, Wang repeatedly emphasized that it was not in accordance with the procedures and refused to implement it. The County Party Committee believed that this task must be completed, so they made a decision and sent it, but Wang's reply was, "The County Party Committee can disregard the system, and I can also not implement the resolution." The County Party Committee then sent the County Magistrate to talk to him face to face, explaining that the County Party Committee and the government were fully responsible for this matter, but there was still no result. This comrade usually pursued independence in cadre transfers and other aspects. (The local Party committee decided to give him the punishment of removing him from his job.) After the exposure and self-criticism, everyone unanimously felt that these phenomena had caused great losses to the revolutionary work, and they were determined to work hard to correct them in the future.

　　北岳检查无政府无纪律
  　干部进行思想鉴定
    【北岳电】上月初旬各地委先后召开的扩干会上，都举行了到会干部的思想鉴定，检查无政府无纪律的现象，一致感到这种倾向已给予革命工作很大损失，决心在今后工作中努力改正。检查中正确的运用了批评与自我批评，格外注意从研究事实谈起，少扣大帽子，对思想弄不通或一时不肯承认错误的，采用个别谈话，帮助反省，并给予继续思考的时间，俟其想想再谈，促其觉悟，这样使人易于心服。到会干部大都对工作和个人的缺点错误进行了揭发，尤其对无组织无纪律无政府的表现，检查更为透彻。灵寿、获鹿县委，都检讨出自己有标新立异目定政策的错误行为。灵寿县委曾自行决定“富裕中农浮财特别多的，如经本人同意，可以动”。执行纠偏政策时，一区委给县委来信说：“纠正侵犯中农是调和办法。”县委对这种错误认识并未指正，却抱默认态度。获鹿县委见到中央局对划成份问题的指示和一九三三年两个文件时，惟恐划少了地、富，贫雇农要求满足不了，遂另作决定，把区别富农与富裕中农的界限，由剥削分量占总收入百分之十五（按中央规定，应该是百分之二十五——编者）降低到百分之十，又另行规定剥削分量占总收入百分之五十做为区别地、富的界限。工商业政策上，该县县委决定：“老区在五四指示以后地富把资产转入工商业者往出拿；边沿区，正太战役后地富把资产转入工商业者往出拿；新区，在石门解放后地富把资产转入工商业者往出拿。”还规定了“市镇地、富出租之房铺归公接管”………等办法，这都是以后执行政策偏向的根源。建屏县委检讨出工作向中央局直接报告的多，向地委报告的少，甚至连六月区党委会议的内容都未进行传达。其他不请示上级擅自作主张“先斩后奏”的现象也很多。如阜平阎致朝同志到五区下乡时，曾擅自发放救灾粮一千斤。满城四区也有私自增派公粮解决军干属困难的行动。平山、获鹿、灵寿等县都有不经批准私支公粮和随便开支的现象。获鹿县武装部长王美山同志闹独立性，拒绝接受党的任务的表现更为严重。事情经过是：晋中战役时弹药运输很急，其时微水大桥被水冲断，来不及另为动员勤务手续，华北兵站特派一教导员向该县县委、县长面商动员大车，因未带动员手续，讲了很多理由，要求通融办理，并保证以后补上。经县委会考虑后，认为可以。与王谈后，王一再强调不合手续，拒不执行，县委认为此一任务非完成不可，即作出决定送去，但王的回答是“县委可以不坚持制度，我也可以不执行决议。”县委又派县长前去面谈，说明此事完全由县委会与政府负责，但是仍无结果。该同志平时在干部调动等方面闹独立性也很厉害（地委决定给予撤销工作的处分），经过揭发检讨后，大家一致感到这些现象给予革命工作的损失很大，决心在今后工作中努力改正。
