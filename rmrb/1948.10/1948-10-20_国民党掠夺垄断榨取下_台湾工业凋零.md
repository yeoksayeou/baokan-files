Xinhua News Agency, North China, 19th: Under the Kuomintang's plunder, monopoly, and exploitation over the past three years, Taiwan's industry has fallen into a tragic state of widespread shutdowns, reduced production, and near death. During the Japanese occupation, the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant could generate 300,000 kilowatts, but now it can only generate 125,000 kilowatts. The output of camphor factories and aluminum smelting factories has been reduced to one-third to one-fifth of their former levels. Taiwan Sugar's output was 1.41 million tons in 1938 during the Japanese occupation, but last year's output was only 30,000 tons. Most sugar factories only operated for four months last year. According to the pro-Kuomintang "Zheng Lun Monthly" (New No. 8, published on August 1st) in Peiping and the Taiwan communications in the "Xin Lu Weekly" (Vol. 1, No. 18, published on September 11th), "only one or two out of ten factories in Taiwan can still emit smoke." A small number of factories monopolized by Kuomintang bureaucratic capital use various methods to cruelly exploit farmers. The Taiwan Provincial Wine Factory, under the pretext of purchasing raw materials, buys rice from farmers at low prices for outward transport to make profits, while using spoiled and rotten warehouse rice mixed with rice bran to make wine. The result is "poor quality and small quantity." The Taiwan Sugar Company forces the implementation of the "sugar sharing method" to exploit farmers. The so-called "sugar sharing method" refers to the fact that after sugarcane farmers hand over sugarcane to the sugar factory to be made into sugar, they divide the output equally with the factory. Because sugarcane farmers cannot afford the transportation costs and taxes, and cannot export, they are forced to sell their share of the product to the company at low prices. The state-run tea company implements a unified purchase and sale system, purchasing tea from tea farmers at low prices and then transporting and selling it to other places at high prices, profiting from the difference. For tea merchants exporting tea, it is stipulated that they must pay the company a so-called "exchange settlement deposit" equivalent to 70% of the value of the goods, forcing tea merchants to prepare almost double the capital, causing tea farmers and tea merchants to complain endlessly. Kuomintang bureaucrats and Taiwanese traitors from the Japanese occupation period take advantage of the closure of factories to stage the ugly drama of "smokeless factories." They jointly organize companies, using the names of these closed factories to obtain cheap allocations, and then sell them at black market prices to make profits. There are currently more than 30 such "smokeless factories" in Taiwan.

### 国民党掠夺垄断榨取下　台湾工业凋零

　　国民党掠夺垄断榨取下
  　台湾工业凋零
    【新华社华北十九日电】台湾工业三年来在国民党的掠夺、垄断、榨取下，已陷于大量停闭、减产、奄奄一息的悲惨境地。日本统治时代日月潭电厂可发电三十万千瓦，现在只能发十二万五千千瓦。樟脑工厂、炼铝工厂，目前产量已减至三分之一到五分之一。台糖产量一九三八年日本统治时代是一百四十一万吨，去年产量仅三万吨。大多数糖厂，去年只开工四个月。据亲国民党的北平正论月刊（新八号，八月一日出版）及新路周刊（一卷十八期，九月十一日出版）台湾通讯披露：台湾的工厂“能够冒烟的已十不一二”。少数为国民党官僚资本垄断的工厂，则用种种方法残酷榨取农民。台湾省营酒厂借口征购原料，以低价向农民收购大米外运图利，而以败坏腐臭的仓米掺杂米糠造酒。其结果是“质劣量少”。台湾糖业公司强迫实行“分糖法”剥削农民。所谓“分糖法”，是指蔗农将甘蔗交与糖厂制成糖后，依照产额与厂方对半平分。蔗农因无力负担运费及税款，无法外销，就被迫将所分的产品以贱价售与公司。官营茶叶公司，则实行统制运销，以贱价向茶农收购茶叶，然后以高价运销外埠，从中渔利。对茶商运茶出口，规定须向该公司缴纳相当于货值百分之七十的所谓“押汇金”，使茶商须备几乎双重资本，茶农茶商莫不叫苦连天。国民党官僚与日本统治时代的台奸，则趁工厂相率倒闭之际，乘机串演“无烟工厂”的丑剧。他们合股组织公司，假借这些停闭工厂的名目，获取廉价配给，然后以黑市价格售出，从中获利。这些“无烟工厂”，目前在台湾已有三十余家。
