[Jinnan Telegram] In order to clarify the future management direction of state-owned enterprises, enforce economic discipline, and reorganize various systems to carry out the construction of New Democratic enterprises, the Jinnan District Trading Company convened a joint conference of general and branch store managers and supervisory committees in late September. An assessment and review of the past year's work was conducted: (1) Achievements: 1. Achieved a stable and slightly rising price level with small fluctuations, initially overcoming the market's blindness. 2. In terms of purchasing, marketing, and adjusting materials, it was done entirely in accordance with the principle of stimulating production and opposing speculation, and most of the military and civilian needs and tasks assigned by higher authorities were completed; moreover, the masses profited 700,000 catties of rice from the absorption of native cloth and towels (excluding oil, salt, and cotton), and the masses transporting goods profited 40 million catties of rice from transportation. 3. In completing the above tasks, national capital was accumulated, and the economic strength of New Democracy was increased. (2) Remaining shortcomings: In management, there remain old commercial profit-seeking views and a purely task-oriented view. In supporting mass production, there exists a one-sided relief or condescending viewpoint. For example, when the Detai Freight Station transported grain to Guangping, Handan, and other places this spring, it emphasized the interests of poor peasants, hiring ox carts instead of mule carts, resulting in particularly high transport costs for small carts, wasting a lot of manpower and national financial resources. In enterprise management, there is a serious phenomenon of extravagance and waste, and an attitude of "it doesn't matter if you spend a little more money" when buying and selling because it is considered a public matter. The management and education of cadres is very poor; the political level of general cadres is not high, and individual cadres exhibit corruption and a lack of organization and discipline. Regarding future directions, specific provisions were made: (1) It is clear that grain, cotton, native cloth, and oil and salt, etc., which are necessary for the masses, should be the main focus, and purchasing and marketing should be carried out in a timely manner according to the needs of the masses. The focus of absorbing native cloth should be on disaster areas, and it should be earnestly combined with production and disaster relief work. At the same time, we should find sales channels for native cloth, strive to improve the quality of native cloth, and resolutely implement the principle of high prices for good cloth, low prices for inferior cloth, and no acceptance of damaged cloth. (2) In supporting production and stabilizing prices, it should be recognized that trade work is an indispensable force for developing production and prospering the economy. We must support production through trade operations, and supply the masses and cooperatives with sufficient agricultural tools, hand-operated machines, etc. We must support things with prospects, sales channels, and benefits to the national livelihood, and grasp the key points. Stabilizing prices is an important task in our trade operations. Unstable prices directly affect the interests of producers and consumers. Therefore, an intelligence system must be established to grasp changes, and appropriate consideration should be given to regional and commodity differences and the profits from transportation and adjustment. However, speculative behavior that hoards goods and manipulates prices must be resolutely opposed and cracked down on. (3) Reorganize the audit and accounting system, establish an economic intelligence system, and strengthen investigation and research. We must accumulate funds, manage scientifically, and calculate accurately in order to achieve the enterprise-based operation of the state-owned economy. (4) Enforce economic discipline, obey centralized unity, and overcome the lack of organization, discipline, anarchism, and bureaucratic phenomena existing in the trade system. Promote the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres, distinguish between merits and demerits, and strictly enforce rewards and punishments.

　　严明经济纪律重整制度通过贸易经营扶助生产
  　冀南贸易公司总结一年工作
    【冀南电】冀南区贸易公司为明确国营企业今后经营方针，与严明经济纪律，重整各种制度，以进行新民主主义的企业建设，特于九月下旬召开总、分店经理监委联席会议。对过去一年的工作作了估价及检讨：（一）成绩方面：一、做到物价平稳上升，波动小，初步地克服了市场的盲目性。二、在吞吐调剂物资上，完全按照刺激生产，反对投机的方针去做，大部完成了军需民用和上级分配给的任务；并从吸收土布、毛巾中，群众获利七十多万斤米（油、盐、棉花不在内），从运输中群众运输得利米四千来万斤。三、在完成以上任务中，积累了国家资未，增加了新民主主义的经济力量。（二）尚存的缺点：经营上残存旧商业的营利观点和单纯的任务观点。扶植群众生产上存有片面的救济观点或恩赐观点。如德太货栈今春向广平、邯郸等地调运粮食时，强调贫农利益，雇牛车不雇骡子车，小车运费特高，浪费了不少人力及国家资财。企业管理上，严重存在着铺张浪费、财大气粗的现象，买卖中觉得是公家的事，多花个钱不在乎。对干部管理教育很差，一般干部政治水平不高，个别的还有腐化现象与无组织无纪律现象。关于今后方针，具体规定：（一）明确以粮食、棉花、土布、油盐等群众必需品为主，根据群众需要，适时进行吞吐。吸收土布应把重点放到灾区，认真结合生产救灾工作。一面还应给土布找出销路，土布质量争取提高，坚决执行好布价高、次布价低、坏布不收的原则。（二）在扶植生产稳定物价上，应认识贸易工作是发展生产繁荣经济不可缺少的力量。要通过贸易经营扶植生产，供给群众和合作社以充分的农具、手工机器等，要扶助有前途有销路，有益国民生计的，掌握重点。稳定物价，是我们经营贸易工作的重要任务。物价不稳，直接影响着生产者与消费者的利益。因之，必须建立情报制度，掌握变化，适当照顾地区性与商品性的差额和运输调剂的利润。但应坚决反对和打击囤积居奇，操纵抬高物价的投机行为。（三）重整审会计制度，建立经济情报制度，加强调查研究。要积累资金，科学管理，精确计算，以便达到国营经济经营的企业化。（四）严明经济纪律，服从集中统一，克服贸易系统中存在的无组织、无纪律、无政府状态及工作中的官僚主义现象。发扬干部的积极性创造性，分清功过，严明奖罚。
