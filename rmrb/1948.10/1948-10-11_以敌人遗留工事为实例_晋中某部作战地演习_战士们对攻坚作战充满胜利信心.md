　　Using Enemy Remnant Fortifications as Examples
  　A Military Exercise by a Unit in Jinzhong
    Soldiers Full of Confidence in Assault Operations

    [Dispatch from the Jinzhong Front] During the battlefield training movement, a unit of the People's Liberation Army used the so-called solid fortifications abandoned by the Yan bandit troops in various parts of Jinzhong as examples to conduct assault exercises involving the coordinated actions of artillery, engineering, and infantry, with great success. The village where the unit was stationed originally had a group of fortifications and bunkers constructed by the Yan bandit troops, surrounded by outer trenches, barbed wire, and caltrops. The bunker walls were 1.2 meters thick, built with bricks inside and out, with cement and stones poured in between. This was the so-called "cement bunker," which the Yan bandits imagined would prolong their dying fate with so-called "solid defenses." The unit used this as the target for assault exercises. When the battle began, our artillery started a fierce bombardment, sending dust flying on the enemy bunker, and one firing port was destroyed. Under the cover of various heavy weapons, demolition teams carried out continuous demolitions, scattering caltrops and barbed wire in all directions. The outer trench, the outer edge, and the inner edge were blasted down, forming a road approaching the bunker. When the demolition team destroyed the bunker with explosives, a cloud of smoke rose up on the spot, and the assault team leaped out of the trenches, rushed straight to the destroyed caltrops and outer trench, quickly charged to the front of the bunker, and victoriously ended the battle. After inspection, the bunker had a huge hole two and a half meters long and one and a half meters wide blasted in it. The soldiers said, "This is an exercise. If it were a real battle, the enemies inside would have already taken a plane!" After the exercise, the soldiers were full of confidence in assault operations.

　　以敌人遗留工事为实例
  　晋中某部作战地演习
    战士们对攻坚作战充满胜利信心
    【晋中前线电】解放军某部在战地练兵运动中，以阎匪遗弃在晋中各地的所谓坚固工事为实例，进行炮、工、步各种兵种协同动作的攻坚演习，收效甚大。该部驻村原有阎匪构筑之一个集团工事、碉堡，周围设有外壕、铁丝网和鹿寨，碉墙厚一米二，内外用砖砌成，当中灌进洋灰和石块；外壕深五米，宽七米，这就是所谓“洋灰碉”，也就是阎匪幻想以此来延续其垂死命运的所谓“坚固设防”。该部即以此为对象，进行攻坚演习。当战斗发起时，我炮兵开始猛烈射击，敌碉上溅起一片灰尘，一个枪眼被摧毁。在各种重火器的掩护下，爆破手进行连续爆破，鹿寨、铁丝网被炸的四处飞散，外壕、外沿和内沿被炸倒，成了一条接近碉堡的道路。当爆破手带着炸药炸毁碉堡时，一片烟尘就地腾起，突击组从战壕里跃起，直扑炸毁了的鹿寨、外壕，迅速冲到碉堡跟前，胜利地结束了战斗。经过检查，这个碉堡被炸了一个长二米五，宽一米五的巨大窟窿。战士们说：“这是演习，如果是真正打仗，里边的敌人早坐了飞机啦”。经过演习，战士们对于攻坚作战充满了胜利信心。
