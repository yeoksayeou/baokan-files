Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: After the former Kuomintang 60th Army Commander Zeng Zesheng and others revolted in Changchun, they sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and others, as well as a circular telegram to all sectors of the country. The texts of the telegrams are as follows:

(I) Telegram to Chairman Mao and others: Respectfully to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander Lin, and Political Commissar Luo:

　　Chiang Kai-shek has usurped the national power through trickery, colluding with American imperialism to harm the people and endanger the country. The corruption of the Chiang Party government is unprecedented. The corruption of officialdom is unseen before. The suffering endured by the people is also greater than ever before. All those with a sense of righteousness are heartbroken. In order to strive for national survival and the people's happiness, the entire army's officers and soldiers have unanimously decided to revolt, join the People's Liberation Army, support the CCP's propositions, implement land reform, obey the leadership of the CCP, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and completely overthrow the rule of the American Chiang in China, in order to relieve the people from their misery. In addition to notifying the whole country, the entire army will remain in their original defenses, awaiting further instructions. We pray for immediate instructions on our tasks, so that we may comply.

Respectfully, Zeng Zesheng, Commander of the Sixtieth Army, Bai Zhaoxue, Commander of the 182nd Division, Long Yao, Commander of the Provisional 21st Division, and all officers and soldiers.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　October 17th

(II) Telegram to All Sectors of the Country: To all national organizations, newspaper offices, and fellow compatriots from all walks of life:

　　Chiang Kai-shek has stolen national power through fraud, suppressed public opinion, and deceived the world in the name of constitutionalism. In foreign affairs, he does not hesitate to sell out the nation and its people, currying favor with American imperialism. In domestic affairs, he does not care about destroying the foundation of the country, creating an anti-people war. After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, we have suffered greatly, and all hope for peace, hoping to create a democratic government and build a new China of freedom and equality. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek is greedy, cruel, and perverse, acting against the tide of history. Since the restoration, he has intensified his actions. To this day, the people in the Chiang-controlled areas are displaced, living in deep water and scorching fire. The corrupt and degenerate behavior of the Chiang government and its subordinate officials is increasingly disregarding the life and death of the nation and its people. Since we left the pass, we have personally witnessed the corruption and chaos of the receiving and ruling personnel, and the displacement of our Northeastern compatriots, and we are deeply saddened. Especially today's Changchun, where the dead and wounded are piled up, and the starved corpses line the roads. Tracing the source of the disaster, it is actually caused by the Chiang family clique's ruining the country and harming the people, and spreading poison. We have reached the point where we can no longer tolerate it. In order to strive for national survival and the people's livelihood, we specially raise the banner of righteousness, gather under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, participate in the People's Front, support land reform, and join hands with the anti-Chiang revolutionary soldiers and civilians across the country to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, thoroughly eliminate the American Chiang's rule in China, and establish an independent, democratic, peaceful, and prosperous new China. We will act swiftly and consistently with this determination. We respectfully ask for your understanding and leadership.

Respectfully, Zeng Zesheng, Commander of the Sixtieth Army in Changchun, Bai Zhaoxue, Commander of the 182nd Division, Long Yao, Commander of the Provisional 21st Division, and all officers and soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Today, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu sent a reply telegram to General Zeng Zesheng, commander of the 60th Army, who revolted in Changchun. The telegram stated: To Commander Zeng, Commander Bai, Commander Long, and all officers and soldiers of the entire army:

　　We have received your telegram of October 17th. We are deeply gratified that your army has revolted in Changchun and joined the People's Liberation Army, enabling Changchun to be liberated in an orderly manner. The actions of your army commander and others should be emulated by all Kuomintang army officers and soldiers in the Northeast and throughout the country who are willing to awaken. It is hoped that your army commander and others, under the direct leadership of Commander Lin and Political Commissar Luo, will unite the entire army, strive for progress, improve the relationship between officers and soldiers, and between the army and the people, and fight alongside the People's Liberation Army of the whole country to drive out the American aggressors, overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries, and build a new China.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Mao Zedong, Zhu De, October 27th

    （一）致毛主席等电：毛主席、朱总司令、林司令员、罗政委钧鉴：
    蒋介石以权术窃据国柄，勾结美帝国主义，戕害人民，危害国家。蒋党政府之腐败，自古未闻。官厅之贪污，前所未见。人民所受之苦痛，亦莫过于今日。凡有血性、莫不痛心。全军官兵，为争取国家生存及人民幸福，一致决心起义，参加人民解放军，拥护中共主张，实行土地改革，服从中共领导，打倒蒋介石，彻底推翻美蒋在中国的统治，以解国人倒悬。除通电全国外，全军各就原防，敬候明命。祈即指示任务，俾便遵行为祷。

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十月十七日
    （二）致全国各界电：全国各团体、各报馆、转各界同胞钧鉴：
    蒋介石以权诈盗窃国柄，钳制民意，假行宪之名愚弄天下。对外不惜出卖国家民族，献媚于美帝国主义。对内不恤摧残国本，制造反人民战争。吾人经八年来之艰苦抗战，创痛巨深，莫不希望和平，方冀产生民主政府，建设自由平等之新中国。讵料蒋介石贪残险狠，倒行逆施。光复以还，变本加厉。时至今日，蒋区人民流离颠沛，水深火热。而蒋政府及其所属官吏之贪污腐化行为，愈益置国家民族之生死于不顾。吾人自出关以来，举凡接收统治人员之贪污狼藉，东北同胞之流离失所，身经目击，为之疾首痛心。尤以今日之长春，死伤枕藉，饿殍载道。推源祸首，实由蒋家集团祸国殃民，流毒所致。吾人至此，实已忍无可忍。为争取国家生存及人民生活，特高举义旗，齐集于毛泽东主席领导之下，参加人民阵线，拥护土地改革，与全国反蒋革命军民携手同心，打倒蒋介石，彻底肃清美蒋在中国的统治，建立独立、民主、和平、富强之新中国。剑及履及，终始此心，敬维鉴领。
    长春第六十军军长曾泽生，第一八二师师长白肇学，暂二十一师师长陇耀及全军官兵同叩。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十月十七日
