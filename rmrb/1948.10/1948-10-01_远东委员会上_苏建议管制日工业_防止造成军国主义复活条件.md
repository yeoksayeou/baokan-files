Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. TASS, Washington: The Far Eastern Commission is discussing the level of Japanese industrial development. The Soviet representative, current Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, made a statement at the meeting on the 23rd regarding the Soviet Union's position, stating that: Industry can serve the purpose of meeting a country's needs during peacetime, and it can also serve the purpose of preparing for war. Only after clarifying this issue can we explain our attitude towards various proposals regarding the future level of industrial production in Japan. At the same time, it should be remembered that Japan should meet the legitimate demands for compensation raised by countries that have been invaded by Japan. "We must now be responsible for ensuring that Japanese militarism does not revive and that Japan does not become a source of war threats again. In order to ensure the completion of this task, the development of Japanese industry must be subordinated to meeting the needs of the Japanese people." "Therefore, the task facing the Allied forces is not to restrict the development of Japan's peaceful industries, but to prohibit the development of war industries and prevent the creation of conditions for the revival of Japanese militarism and Japanese aggression." To this end, Pan put forward an effective proposal, saying: "The Soviet government believes that this problem can be solved by establishing appropriate control in Japan for a certain period to prevent the restoration or creation of Japanese war industries. The peace treaty with Japan must stipulate that control for several years will be exercised by those countries that are most concerned about Japan's re-aggression; and the time to prepare and conclude the peace treaty with Japan has long been ripe." Pan Youxin, on behalf of the Soviet government, requested that the meeting adopt this plan.

    苏建议管制日工业
    防止造成军国主义复活条件
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：远东委员会正在讨论日本工业发展的水平问题，苏联代表现任驻美大使潘友新二十三日在会议上就苏联主张发表声明，略称：工业可以满足国家和平时期需要的功用，也可以产生准备战争的功用，只有弄清楚这个问题以后，才能说明对于有关日本将来工业生产水平的各种建议所持的态度。同时，应记住日本应满足受过日本侵略的国家所提的合法的赔偿要求。“我们现在必须负责使日本军国主义不复活，使日本不再度成为战争威胁的所在地。为了保证完成这一任务，就必须使日本工业发展从属于满足日本人民的需要。”“因此，盟军所面对的任务，不是限制日本和平工业的发展，而是禁止战争工业的发展；防止造成日本军国主义与日本侵略复活的条件。”至此，潘氏提出有效方案称：“苏联政府认为：只要在日本建立若干时期的适当管制，以便防止日本战争工业的恢复或创立，便能解决这一问题。对日和约中必须规定由那些对于日本再度侵略最感利害攸关的国家施行数年的管制；而准备并缔结对日和约的时机是早就成熟了的”。潘友新代表苏联政府，要求会议采纳这一方案。
