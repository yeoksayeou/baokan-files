Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th—Recently, the phenomenon of material shortages and rising prices in major cities under Kuomintang rule has become more serious, with panic buying erupting.

    Shanghai and Nanjing: Recently, both cities have experienced panic buying. In Shanghai, "ordinary citizens are buying materials everywhere all day long" (Chiang Ching-kuo, speaking in Shanghai on the 6th). The Nanjing Municipal Government has also had to order limited purchases based on ID cards. At the same time, rice, which is generally used as a benchmark for price fluctuations, is both scarce and expensive. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on September 24th: on the 22nd, Shanghai rice prices soared, and on the 23rd, there was still no good quality rice available on the market. Although managers (secret agents) and Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, personally supervised the market, it was ineffective. Also, flour and other commodities were barely traded.

    Beijing and Tianjin: "The economic situation is currently in a pathetic state. Flour, meat, and other foods are practically unavailable for sale. Price controls are almost universally ignored, and black market trading in gold bars, silver coins, and US dollars continues to occur" (Associated Press, 5th). According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on September 24th: "The grain market in Tianjin is increasingly chaotic, with rice, flour, cornmeal, etc., difficult to purchase"; "A sense of terror – famine – is increasing the threat to ordinary people. Some people are carrying flour sacks, running to several grain stores from morning to night, worrying about not being able to buy cornmeal." In addition to the grain shortage, the meat shortage is also severe. In Beiping, meat is only sold on the black market, with prices more than three and a half times higher than the level of August 19th (Associated Press, 5th). In Tianjin, "since the morning of September 15th, all pork shops have had no meat for sale" (Dagongbao, September 16th). On the 23rd, "only three pigs were slaughtered in the entire city, two of which were forcibly purchased by a powerful organization, leaving only one pig to be distributed among the city's 1.8 million people" (Xinxingbao, September 24th).

    Under these circumstances, the Kuomintang reactionaries are intensifying their terror tactics. Chiang Kai-shek went from Beiping to Tianjin on the 4th, "turning his attention to the economic situation in North China" (Associated Press, 5th). Chiang Ching-kuo repeatedly made speeches in Shanghai, resorting to all kinds of deception and intimidation. At the same time, the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce has decided to "investigate" materials in various places, preparing to implement suppression. Shanghai has implemented a city-wide general registration and general inspection of materials and raw materials, forcing merchants to sell according to "price limits."

### 蒋区各大城市物资日益匮乏　沪宁发生抢购风潮

　　蒋区各大城市物资日益匮乏
    沪宁发生抢购风潮
    【新华社陕北九日电】近来国民党统治区各大城市物资匮乏与物价上涨的现象更形严重，并且发生抢购风潮。
    沪宁方面：近日两地都发生抢购物品的风潮。上海“一般市民终日到处购买物资”（蒋经国六日在沪演讲），南京市政府也不得不下令凭身份证限量购买。同时作为一般物价涨落准绳的米粮亦货缺价高。据九月二十四日天津益世报讯：二十二日上海米价直入云霄，二十三日市场上仍无好货应市。虽有经管人员（特务）与米业公会理事长万墨林亲自到场监视，亦未生效。又面粉等几无成交。
    平津方面：“经济情势现处于可怜状态中，面粉、肉类及其他食物实际已不见出售，物价管制几被普遍无视，金条、银币与美钞的黑市交易仍然发生”（美联社五日电）。另据九月二十四日天津益世报讯：“津市粮食市场日益混乱，米、面、玉米面等不易购买”；“一种恐怖的感觉——粮荒，却加重了对升斗小民的威胁。有人提着面口袋，从早到晚，跑了好几处粮店，在为买不着棒子面而发愁。”除了粮荒外，肉荒也很严重。北平肉类仅在黑市上有卖，价格超出八月十九日水平三倍半以上（美联社五日电）。天津“由九月十五日晨起，各猪肉馆均无肉出售”（九月十六日大公报）。二十三日“全市仅宰猪三只，其中两只为某有力机关强行购去，全市一百八十万人口仅有一猪可供分配”（九月二十四日新星报）。
    在这种情况下，国民党反动当局仍加紧其恐怖手段。蒋贼介石四日自北平至天津，“将其注意力转向华北经济情势”（美联社五日电）。蒋经国在上海一再发表谈话，极尽欺哄吓诈的能事。同时伪工商部已决定“调查”各地物资，准备实行镇压。上海已实行全市物资原料总登记及总检查，强迫商民按照“限价”出售。
