Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: The Soviet decision to withdraw troops has aroused warm gratitude from the entire Korean people towards the Soviet Union, while simultaneously intensifying their justified demands for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea. The Supreme People's Assembly of Korea convened on September 20th to discuss and unanimously agreed that this was a historically significant action by the Soviet Union respecting the sovereignty of the Korean people. It passed a letter of thanks to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and pointed out the necessity for the entire Korean people to struggle for the withdrawal of US troops from Korea. Mass rallies have been held throughout North Korea, unanimously expressing gratitude to the Soviet Union and indignation towards the United States. Choi Kyung-deok (transliteration), chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Federation of Trade Unions, wrote in "Labor News" (transliteration): "The Soviet Union has granted the request of the Korean people. The Soviet Union has once again demonstrated its just policy of respecting the equality of all countries. We will always remember its friendly assistance. The future of Korea and its independence are tied to friendship with the Soviet Union." All newspapers pointed out that the news of the Soviet military's decision to withdraw from North Korea has triggered mass movements in South Korea demanding the withdrawal of US troops. On September 24th, the newspapers reprinted the statement of the Central Committee of the South Korean People's Democratic Front, demanding the simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet troops. Under pressure from public opinion, even leaders of South Korea's right-wing groups and some members of the puppet National Assembly had to make statements expressing support for the Soviet government's decision and demanding the withdrawal of US troops. For example, Kim Gu, leader of the right-wing Independence Party, declared on September 21st: "The Soviet Union has decided to withdraw its troops from Korea. This means that the Soviet Union knows what our nation expects and demands. But American policy is always lagging behind." However, the American puppet Syngman Rhee and his followers declared that they insisted on the continued presence of US troops in South Korea. Democratic public opinion condemned Syngman Rhee's position as openly betraying the national interests of the Korean people. Currently, the movement demanding the withdrawal of US troops is growing in both North and South Korea.

　　全鲜感激苏联撤军决定
    对美军不愿撤离南鲜一致表示愤慨
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社平壤讯：苏联撤军决定，引起了朝鲜全体人民对苏联的热烈感戴，同时加紧了他们对美军撤离南朝鲜的正当要求。朝鲜最高人民议会于九月二十日开会讨论，一致认为这是苏联尊重朝鲜人民主权的有历史意义的行动，通过致苏联最高苏维埃主席团的谢函，并指明朝鲜全体人民为争取美军撤离朝鲜而斗争的必要。北朝鲜各地均举行群众集会，一致表示对苏联的感谢和对美国的愤慨。北朝鲜工会联合会中央委员会主席崔景德（译音）在“劳动新闻”（译音）上写道：“苏联已答应了朝鲜人民的请求。苏联已再度表明了其尊重各国平等的公正政策。我们将永远记住它友好的协助。朝鲜的前途及其独立，系于与苏联的友谊”。各报均指出苏军决定从北朝鲜撤退的消息，在南朝鲜引起了要求美军撤退的群众运动。九月二十四日各报转载了南朝鲜人民民主阵线中央委员会的声明，要求美占领军和苏军同时撤离。在舆论的压力下，甚至南朝鲜右翼集团的领袖及伪国会某些议员也不得不发表谈话，表示赞同苏联政府的决定并要求美军撤退。例如：右翼的独立党领袖金九于九月二十一日宣称：“苏联已决定自朝鲜撤军。这就是说：苏联知道我们民族所期望与所要求的是什么。而美国的政策总是落在后面。”但美国傀儡李承晚及其徒众却宣称：他们坚持要美军继续留在南朝鲜。民主舆论斥责李承晚的立场为公开出卖朝鲜人民的民族利益。现南北朝鲜各地要求美军撤退的运动正在增长中。
