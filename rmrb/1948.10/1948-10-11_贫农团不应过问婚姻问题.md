　　Poor Peasants' Associations Should Not Interfere in Marriage Issues
    Editor:
    I have some questions about marriage issues that I'm unclear about, please answer:
    In some villages now, all marriage issues must be approved by the Poor Peasants' Association. Sometimes, both the man and woman agree and are ready to register with the district government, but when they go to the Poor Peasants' Association for an introduction letter, it often gets delayed because the representatives are not all present, and they reply that they need to discuss it. This often drags on for a long time. I ask, since both the man and woman agree, there are matchmakers, and they are of suitable age, according to the principle of freedom of marriage, if they don't have an introduction letter from the Poor Peasants' Association, will the district government still register them? Also, some villages have rules that landlords are not allowed to marry landlords, rich peasants are not allowed to marry rich peasants, and poor peasants are not allowed to marry landlords or rich peasants. When will the lifelong matters of these landlord and rich peasant families' children be resolved?

    Answer: Regarding marriage issues, there are clear provisions in the Marriage Law, namely that on the principle of equality, voluntariness, and freedom for both men and women, no group or individual may force or interfere. They can go to the township government for an introduction letter, then go to the county government to register and obtain a marriage certificate.
    The Poor Peasants' Association is a grassroots organization during the land reform period, playing a leading and backbone role in the land reform, but it cannot take over everything and replace the government. Marriage procedures fall within the scope of administration, and the Poor Peasants' Association should not interfere. In the future, marriage should be handled by the village government writing an introduction letter to the township government for registration and obtaining a marriage certificate. If the village government does not provide an introduction letter, one can directly apply to the district or county government for registration and a marriage certificate.
    In addition, marriage should be based on the spirit of equality, voluntariness, and freedom, regardless of class background. As long as it does not violate the principles of the Marriage Law, anyone can marry. Restricting landlords from marrying landlords and poor peasants from marrying landlords or rich peasants is wrong and should be corrected.

　　贫农团不应过问婚姻问题编辑同志：
    关于婚姻问题，我有几个不明白的地方，请答复：
    现在有的村庄，凡是婚姻问题，都要经过贫农团批准，但有时男女双方都同意了，准备到区政府登记，可是一到贫农团开介绍信，常因代表不全，答复商量商量，讨论讨论，这样一来，时间常常拖延的很长。我问既然男女双方同意又有介绍人，年岁又相当，本着婚姻自主的原则，如果没有贫农团的介绍信，区政府是否给登记？另外还有村子规定地主不准与地主结婚，富农不准与富农结婚，贫农不准和地富结婚，这些地富家的子女的终身大事，什么时候解决呢？

    答　关于婚姻问题，在婚姻法上曾有明文规定，即男女双方在平等自愿自主的原则下，任何团体或个人均不得强迫或干涉，可经过村政府介绍到　政府进行登记领取结婚证书。
    贫农团是在土改期中的一雇贫种组织，在土改中起领导骨干作用，但不能包办一切，代替政府。结婚手续属于行政范围，贫农团不应干涉。今后结婚应由村政府写介绍信到　政府登记，领取结婚证。如村政府不给写介绍信，亦可直接向区政府或县政府申请登记领结婚证。
    另外男女结婚应本平等自愿自主的精神，不论什么阶级成份，在不违反婚姻法的原则下，均可结婚。限制地富不能与地富结婚，贫农不能与地富结婚是错误的，应予以纠正。
