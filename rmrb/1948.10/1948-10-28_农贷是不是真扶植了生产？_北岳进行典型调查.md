Did Agricultural Loans Truly Support Production?
　　Typical Investigation in Northern Yue
　　[Northern Yue News] In order to understand the role of this year's agricultural loans in agricultural production and to ensure that future agricultural loans truly support mass production, the Northern Yue Administrative Office recently organized three work groups to conduct typical investigations in ten villages in the fourth and fifth special districts. The investigations revealed that while some achievements had been made in providing loans to support production in the past, there were still many chaotic phenomena: (1) Instead of conducting in-depth investigations to understand the situation and distribute loans based on specific needs, loans were distributed to various villages through the administrative system in a rushed manner. This led to instances of village cadres secretly controlling the loans. In Langyagou, Laiyuan, cadres filled in their own names and the names of female family members when filling out the names of loan recipients, with one family occupying two shares. Some cadres colluded with each other, only granting loans to a single family. Liu Yulong, the deputy of Fawangou Village, did not have production difficulties, but he, his son, and his brother all received grain loans. (2) Egalitarianism and a patronizing attitude prevailed. For example, Shacheng Village in Quyang received more than 3,000 catties of grain loans and 551,000 yuan in funds, which were mostly distributed equally by group. Chand Village received more than 4,300 catties of grain loans and more than 400,000 yuan in funds, which were distributed so dispersedly and equally that they did not provide much help to anyone. Many spinning wheels and looms could not be started due to insufficient capital. Luo Xiaodang from Langyagou, Laiyuan, used the grain and money he borrowed to buy fried cakes and meat at the market. (3) Insufficient publicity and unclear procedures led to speculative behavior, and even confusion about the amount of grain and money borrowed. Liu Guogui, deputy director of the Armed Forces Committee of Dataie Village in the fourth district of Laiyuan, and three others did not need loans, but they borrowed three dou of grain and 100,000 yuan in loans, which they transferred to Liu Guowei and another person, saying, "If the superiors ask for it in the future, you can return it. If they don't, we'll divide it equally among our families." In Fawangou and other seven villages in the third district, the masses were afraid that they would not be able to repay the loans, so they dared not borrow. The district said, "If you can't repay, it can be extended for two to three years." In some agricultural loans in Laiyuan, Fuping, and other counties, the work group introduced the recipients, and some did not even have receipts, resulting in unclear amounts. The reasons for these problems are: (1) There were no dedicated personnel in charge. Cadres treated loans as an incidental task and did not conduct thorough inspections after distributing them. (2) Cadres at all levels did not conduct in-depth publicity work among the masses to ensure that loans were truly used for production.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Editor's Note: It is necessary and good for the Northern Yue Administrative Office to conduct such inspections. The problems identified are also real. However, in order to correct these problems, in addition to the two reasons pointed out in the report that should lead to the conclusion of assigning dedicated personnel to conduct in-depth publicity, it is also necessary to study the organization of the entire rural loan and promotion of production, namely, the organization of cooperatives. Bank loans should also be channeled through cooperatives, mainly to cooperative members, so as to promote production through cooperatives and gradually guide farmers after land reform onto the path of collectivization. We would like to discuss whether this is appropriate with the Northern Yue Administrative Office.

### 农贷是不是真扶植了生产？　北岳进行典型调查

　　农贷是不是真扶植了生产？
  　北岳进行典型调查
    【北岳讯】北岳行署为了了解今年农贷对农业生产所起的作用，使今后农贷真能扶植群众生产，近组织三个工作组，在四、五专区进行了十个村的典型调查，发现过去在发放贷款扶助生产上，确已获得不少成绩，但也还存在着不少混乱现象：（一）事先没深入调查了解情况，根据具体需要进行发放；而是按行政系统把农贷分到各村，突击发放。因此发生了不少村干暗中把持贷款现象。涞源狼牙口干部填写贷户的名字时，填上了自己，又填上家里女人名字，一家占两份，也有干部互相包庇，只贷给一门一姓。发旺沟村副刘玉隆生产并不困难，他和他儿子他哥哥却都贷了粮。（二）平均主义，恩赐观点。如曲阳砂城村贷粮三千多斤，款五十五万一千元，大部是以组为单位平均分配了。产德村贷粮四千三百多斤，款四十多万，贷的又分散又平均，结果对谁家也没多大帮助，许多纺花车和织布机因本钱不够，不能开动。涞源狼牙口罗小党贷了粮款在集上换了煎饼肉吃了。（三）宣传不深入，手续不清楚，因此发生投机取巧的现象，甚至连贷的粮款数目都弄不清。涞源四区大台峨村武委会副主任刘国贵等四人，谁都不需要贷，但他们贷粮三斗，贷款十万元，转给刘国未二人，并说：“以后上级要时你们就还，如不要，咱们几家平分。”三区发旺沟等七村，群众怕到时归还不了，不敢贷；区里说：“还不了可延长二年至三年。”涞源、阜平等县有些发放农贷时，由工作组介绍领取，有的连条子也没有，结果弄的数目也查不清了。发生这些问题的原因：（一）没有专人负责，干部把贷款当成附带工作，贷下去后又不很好检查。（二）各级干部对群众没作深入的宣传工作，使贷款真正用于生产。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：北岳行署进行这样的检查是必要的，很好的，某所检查出来的弊病也是真实的。但为了纠正这些毛病，除开如报导所指出的两项原因应得出的结论指定专人负责进行深入宣传外，还需要研究农村整个贷款和推进生产的组织，即合作社的组织，银行的贷款也同样应经过合作社，主要的是贷给合作社成员，以便经过合作社，把生产推动起来，逐渐把土改后的农民引导上集体化的道路上来。是否有当，愿与北岳行署商榷。
