　　The Benefits of Autumn Plowing
  　Xi Fengzhou
    Autumn plowing is an important part of the land cultivation process, as it is a preparation for spring plowing. However, many areas do not pay enough attention to it, and some even think that autumn-plowed land is not as important as spring-plowed land, which is a mistake.

    In the past, the experience of many areas in Taihang showed that land without autumn plowing often suffered significant production losses because the soil was too dry to catch seedlings well. Especially this year, with the severe insect plague, autumn plowing is even more necessary. As for the benefits of autumn plowing, many people know, such as: "Plowing the land in autumn, equivalent to three plows in spring," "One kick in autumn surpasses digging in spring," "An eighty-year-old man never forgets autumn-plowed land," etc., all illustrating the importance of autumn plowing for crop growth.

    First, after the land is autumn-plowed, the soil can be improved, loosened, and refined, making it easier to sow seeds. It also makes it easier for the seedlings to emerge from the soil, and the roots of the young plants can penetrate deep into the soil and absorb more water and nutrients. After the land is turned over, the soil undergoes a kind of "weathering action," the gaps in the ground will increase, and the area will also increase. With more air in the soil, the soil quality will become fertile. Some people say: Autumn-plowed land is like applying manure once, and that's the reason.

    Second, autumn-plowed land has a strong ability to retain moisture. It easily absorbs rain and snow, increasing drought resistance. Especially in North China, where spring droughts occur nine out of ten years, autumn plowing is even more necessary to facilitate spring planting.

    Third, autumn plowing is indeed the most effective way to prevent and control pests. When the weather is cold, insects hide in the soil to overwinter. If the land is plowed now, the nests of pests can be destroyed, and insect eggs, larvae, and pupae can be turned out of the soil. After being exposed to wind and freezing, they will die. In this way, next year's insect plague can be reduced. Areas that have experienced insect plagues should pay special attention to autumn plowing.

    Fourth, autumn plowing can also eliminate weeds and help crops grow well. In recent years, due to rough cultivation and weeding, there have been particularly many weeds in the fields. If the soil is turned over by autumn plowing, the weed seeds on the surface will be turned into the deep soil, which will reduce the growth of weeds in the future. In addition, it will also reduce many of the perennial weeds underground.

    It is best not to level the autumn-plowed land, because leveling it will reduce the effectiveness of freezing pests, absorbing rain and snow, and weathering the soil. However, in some areas, because there is no such custom, the land is leveled after autumn plowing. It is said that they are afraid that the lack of rain in the spring will make the clods hard and inconvenient for planting. This is not good. It is best to harrow the land around the time of the Awakening of Insects, so that the large clods can be crushed.

    The main difficulty in autumn plowing this year is the issue of labor and animal power. Therefore, how to achieve scientific use of labor and animal power, as well as proper planning and arrangement of this work, is an important task for leadership. In particular, how to enable poor farmers and families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs who lack labor and animal power to carry out autumn plowing needs attention. It is also necessary to grasp the time. If it is too late, the land will freeze and cannot be plowed. Local leaders must seize the season, strengthen organization, and strive to achieve as much universal autumn plowing as possible.

　　秋耕的好处
  　席凤洲
    秋耕在土地耕种过程上是一个重要环节，因秋耕即春耕的准备。但有很多地区并没有十分重视，还有认为秋垡地不如春耕地要紧，这思想是错误的。
    过去太行不少地区的经验，凡是没有秋耕的土地，常因垧土过干，不能很好捉苗，给生产很大的损失。特别是今年虫灾严重，秋耕就更加必要。至于秋耕的好处，不少人都知道，如：“秋天垡地犁破皮，顶住春天犁三犁”“秋天踢一脚，超过春天掘一＠”“八十老翁不忘秋耕地”……等，都说明秋耕对于庄稼生长的重要。
    首先土地经过秋耕以后，能够使土壤变好、变松、变细，下种方便，而且也容易出土，小苗的根能够很好深入土中，吸收水分和土中的养料就比较多。土地经过翻了以后，土壤起一种“风化作用”，地里的空隙就会增多，面积也会加大，土中空气多了，土质就会变肥。有人说：秋耕过的土地，如同上次粪，就是这个道理。
    第二、秋耕过的土地，保存水分的力量强。容易吸收雨雪，增加防旱作用。物别是在华北地区，十有九年闹春旱，为了便利春耕下种，更需要进行秋耕。
    第三、秋耕对于防除虫害，确是一个最有效的办法，天冷虫藏伏土内过冬，如果现在把地耕一下，就可破坏害虫的巢窝，从土中翻出虫卵、幼虫和虫蛹，经过风吹冰冻，就会死去。这样，就可减少明年的虫灾。有过虫灾的地区应特别注意秋耕。
    第四、秋耕还能消灭杂草，帮助庄稼长好。这几年因为耕锄粗糙，地里长草特别多。如果秋耕翻翻土，地表的草籽就翻到深土中，便会减少将来杂草的生长。另外，对于地下的宿根草，也会减去很多。
    秋耕的土地，最好不要耢平，因为耢平以后，对于冻死虫害、吸收雨雪、风化土壤的效力就小了。但在部分地区因为没有这样习惯，秋耕后就耢平了。据说是怕春天缺雨，土块硬不便下种。这样不好，最好在惊蛰前后，把土地耙一下，大土块就可耙碎。
    今年秋耕最主要的困难，是劳畜力问题，因此，如何做到科学的使用劳畜力，以及适当的计划、安排这一工作，是领导上的重要任务。特别对于缺乏劳畜力的贫苦农民和军干烈属，怎样使他们能够秋耕，是需要注意的。再应掌握时间，如果太晚，地一冻就不能耕了。各地领导上必须抓紧季节加强组织，做到尽可能的普遍秋耕。
