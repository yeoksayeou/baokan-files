Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, New York - General Secretary of the Communist Party USA, Dennis, at a rally in Madison Square on September 23rd, called on the American people to organize mass demonstrations on October 15th - the day of the so-called trial of twelve communist leaders - demanding the dismissal of the charges against them. Dennis called on the millions of men and women blacklisted by the "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee" secret service to participate in this movement for the sake of peace and democracy. At the same time, 481 black celebrities, led by black Progressive Party leader and singer Paul Robeson, jointly sent a petition to the US Department of Justice, requesting the cancellation of the charges against the twelve communist leaders, pointing out that: this behavior encourages the remnants of fascism in the world, and prosecuting communists is an attack on the freedom of all American citizens.

　　但尼斯号召示威
    反对审讯美共领袖
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社纽约讯；美共总书记但尼斯九月二十三日在麦迪逊广场的集会上号召美国人民于十月十五日——所谓审讯十二位共产党领袖的日子，组织群众示威，要求撤消对他们的控告。但尼斯号召被国会“非美活动调查委员会”特务机关列入黑名单的百万男女，为了和平民主的利益，参加这一运动。同时，以进步党黑人领袖歌王罗伯逊等为首的四百八十一位黑人名流，联名向美司法部致送申请书一件，要求取消对十二位共产党领袖的控告，指出：这种行为鼓励了世界的法西斯余孽，控告共产党人即是对美国一切公民自由的进攻。
