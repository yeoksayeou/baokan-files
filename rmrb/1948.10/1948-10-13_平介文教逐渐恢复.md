[Jinzhong Telegram] The cultural and educational work in Pingyao and Jiexiu has gradually recovered in the past two months under the support of the democratic government. In order to develop education, the two counties held four training classes in August and September. More than 800 teachers and intellectuals from the new district participated. Through policy and current affairs study and discussion, some concerns were dispelled, and they understood our party's policy of uniting intellectuals. In addition to appointing most of them as city and township teachers, the government tried its best to find ways to resettle the rest and introduce them to work. In early September, Pingzhong, Jiezhong, five complete elementary schools in Pingyao City, eight senior elementary schools in the two counties, and most rural elementary schools in Ping, Lu, and Jie opened. More than 1,200 students attended school in Pingyao City.

　　平介文教逐渐恢复
    【晋中电】平遥、介休的文化教育工作，两月来在民主政府扶持下，已逐渐恢复。该两县为发展教育，曾在八九月间分别召开轮训班四次。新区教员和知识分子参加者八百余人。在政策、时事学习讨论中，解除了某些顾虑，了解了我党团结知识分子的政策。政府除委派绝大部分担任市乡教员外，其余则竭力设法安置，介绍工作。九月初，平中、介中、平遥市五座完小、两县八座高小及平、陆、介大部乡村小学均已开学，平遥市到校学生一千二百余名。
