　　In order to implement the spirit of the District Party Committee's August meeting, all counties have launched large-scale training classes for village-level cadres and party members as an effective method to resolve ideological issues of cadres and party members in implementing the Party's policies. From around August 20th to around September 25th, approximately 35,000 people were trained throughout the district. The results were generally good, with most cadres and party members who returned after training shifting from passive to active. For example, among the 831 trainees in Qinyang, 27.6% showed positive performance and could become backbones, 38.5% could generally complete tasks, 24% remained inactive, and 3.85% still harbored resistance. A group of new district-level cadres also emerged during the training. For example, the four units of Lin County, Heshun, Xiyang, and the Third Prefectural Committee Party School promoted 232 people. In addition, after the training, various counties conducted experiments in several villages to conclude land reform. All of this prepared favorable conditions for concluding land reform and carrying out democratic party rectification after the autumn harvest.
    From the results of training in various places, what experiences are worth drawing on?
    First, the combination of sincere and appropriate self-criticism by leaders and encouraging comrades below to launch self-criticism movements is the only way to break down all doubts and denials about the party rectification policy.
    In the first half of the year, in terms of party rectification methods in experimental villages, rural branch party members were generally subjected to undifferentiated suspension of activities and removal from office, handed over to mass meetings with complex compositions or party rectification committees and mass representative meetings without party member participation for rectification. In order to support the masses, party members were not even allowed to defend themselves, and the decision on whether or not to punish party members, or the severity of the punishment, was decided by the masses. All of this aroused dissatisfaction among party members and produced many confused ideas in their minds, such as "being a party member is not as good as being a member of the masses," "working is not as good as not working," "being active is not as good as not being active," and "ten good things cannot outweigh one bad thing," etc. In the early stages of the training class, such expressions of dissatisfaction will inevitably be encountered. At this time, leaders must patiently listen to their appeals and, at an appropriate time, make sincere and appropriate self-criticism, admitting that due to the serious impure atmosphere within the party revealed at that time, the clear analysis of the branch situation was lost during the party rectification in the first half of the year, the foundation of the party was underestimated, and the poor peasant associations were trusted more than the branch, so the party members were put aside and allowed the masses to rectify them freely, resulting in damage to the party's prestige among the masses. This tailism error committed in the party rectification method must not be repeated in the future. Experience has proven that this sincere and appropriate self-criticism by leaders will greatly move party members and play a significant role in promoting party unity. Only on this basis can party members be further induced to turn to discussing the relationship between the party and the masses, and whether the party does not need rectification anymore. Better party members will then stand on the party's position, gradually launch ideological struggles against all those who deny party rectification, and, in conjunction with self-criticism, cite the facts of rural party members' separation from the masses to prove the necessity of party rectification. Some training classes did a very good job in this regard. For example, in the She County training class, in refuting the argument that "party rectification is superfluous," a village cadre reflected: "During the movement, the superiors only approved our village to struggle against eight households of feudal landlords, but in order to get more things, the branch privately added six more households, all of whom were middle peasants. In order to deceive the superiors, they deliberately said that he had exploitation. Such deception of the Party and harming the people will be terrible if it is not rectified.” A village cadre reflected: "Party members collectively stole fruits and secretly made a condition that 'no one is allowed to reveal it, and violators will be stabbed with white knives'. There are many such facts. The development of this self-criticism and the appropriate exposure of impure phenomena within the party can criticize the views of those who deny party rectification, and make each party member consciously aware of the necessity of party rectification.
    After resolving the issue that the party must be rectified, how to rectify it became the issue that every party member is most concerned about. The experience of solving this issue is to guide party members to combine with practice to understand that the reason for the impurity within the party is mainly that there has been too little criticism and self-criticism within the party in the past. To solve the existing impurity, we must rely on criticism and self-criticism within the party. This is the basic method of party rectification. The participation of mass representatives is to assist us, not to replace us in rectifying ourselves, nor can it replace us. It is wrong to hand over party members to the masses for free rectification like struggling against landlords.
    Experience from training classes in various places has proven that generally greater results are achieved when the above steps are followed. Conversely, it is not easy to do well if leaders suppress party members' freedom to accuse while not engaging in self-criticism, or only engage in abstract and perfunctory self-criticism and then ask those below to engage in self-criticism. At the same time, leaders who do not carefully inspire those below to engage in self-criticism and take on all mistakes through wholesale self-criticism will not only not solve the problem but will deepen the confusion.
    Second, we must proceed from the perspective of developing production, guiding party members and cadres to consciously understand the importance of concluding land reform work and correctly implementing the policy of concluding land reform.
    When the training class turns to studying the policy of concluding land reform, it generally starts with comparing the production of the masses this year with last year. The people participating in the study will cite many facts to illustrate that the production of the masses urgently needs leadership. Then, the District Party Committee's decision on concluding land reform, ensuring land rights, issuing land certificates, and working together to boost production is conveyed, and everyone unanimously agrees with this policy. However, opinions are very divided on how to deal with the landlords, rich peasants, and some middle peasants who have been swept out the door in the past. During the discussion, some advocated that there was no need to worry about them, and they would find it too tiring to even give them back their land. Others said: "Giving land back to landlords and rich peasants will inevitably affect others, and it will cause more trouble, so it is better not to move them." Some believed that the remaining fruit tree land, public land, temple land, and school land should be dealt with as much as possible, and the superiors should find a way to make up for any shortages. Some retorted, saying that if it is not resolved seriously, the unsafe phenomenon of stealing and robbing and reaching out for things will never be eliminated. Some said that if it is resolved well, where will the land come from? Some said that it should be calculated according to the average land standard per person in the whole village, and those who exceed it should take it out. Resistance to resettlement compensation and the idea of absolute equality were very strong in the disputes. These two ideas must be opposed in the training class; however, the effective method to overcome this tendency must be to educate party members and cadres to understand the District Party Committee's regulations on separate compensation and sources of land. On the other hand, village cadres must be allowed to formulate resettlement compensation plans according to the specific conditions of each village and submit them to the county district for review and approval in order to finally ensure the correct implementation of the land reform conclusion policy.
    Experience has proven that all those who have followed the above steps have achieved great results. Conversely, if the education on why to conclude land reform is not emphasized and a purely task-oriented viewpoint is adopted, it will inevitably cause social chaos. On the policy of concluding land reform, if only resettlement compensation is unilaterally emphasized, the idea of absolute equality will inevitably arise; if absolute equality is unilaterally opposed, it is also easy to neglect resettlement compensation. The effective method to prevent these two biases is not something that can be solved by general empty talk in the training class. The decisive link is the detailed formulation and careful review of the village's plans when specifically implementing the conclusion of land reform.
    Third, adjusting relationships in the village must be one of the important contents of the training.
    The tendency of extreme democratization among the masses is still very serious at present. Some even openly resist business trips, grain payment, meetings, and even disturb social order. No one dares to stop them. Many people believe that democracy means they can ignore the law, leaving village cadres helpless. Secondly, the complex factional struggles and disunity in the village make it impossible to implement any resolutions. Thirdly, the relationship between various organizations in the village, such as the branch, the People's Congress, the village government, and the Farmers' Association, is unclear. These are all problems that urgently need to be solved in rural areas at present. However, most training sessions in various places have ignored this, and therefore, in the practice of concluding land reform, some places have had to stop the land reform conclusion work due to disputes over village issues and turn to solve them first. This can be regarded as a lesson.
    Fourth, the general leadership experience of the training class.
    There are many experiences from training classes in various places, but there are several points that can be universally applied: (1) It is best to mobilize trainees in groups, mobilizing six or seven from each village at a time. This not only facilitates understanding the situation of the whole village, but also makes it easy to directly adjust the relationship between each other. It is also easier to form a strong group leadership after returning to the village, which is more effective than sending one or two from each village at a time. (2) Training classes with a large number of people must have a group of cadres who have understood the ideology as the backbone in order to achieve greater results. It is not good for some counties to put county, district, and village cadres together. (3) The learning method generally adopts the approach of first raising questions and letting everyone discuss and deliberate. On the basis of deliberation, the Party's decision is gradually conveyed in combination with their thoughts, which is easier for the trainees to digest. Conversely, it is very ineffective to give large lectures and copy the transmission. (4) In terms of the arrangement of learning content, it is generally smoother for the thinking and emotions of cadres to learn the party rectification policy first and then the land reform policy. (5) In addition, it is very important to take care of life with enthusiasm and pay careful attention to trivial issues.

### 太行各地　训练村干党员经验

　　太行各地
  　训练村干党员经验
    太行区党委办公室
    为贯彻区党委八月会议精神，各县都大规模的开办了村级干部党员训练班，作为解决干部党员思想贯彻党的政策的有效方法。从八月二十日前后开始，到九月二十五日左右结束，全区训练约计三万五千余人；结果一般都好，受训回去后的干部党员，大部已由消极转向了积极。如沁阳受训学员八百三十一人中，回后表现积极能当骨干者占百分之二十七点六，一般能完成任务者占百分之三十八点五，不动者占百分之二十四，仍怀抵抗情绪者占百分之三点八五。训练中又生长了一批新的区级干部，如林县、和顺、昔阳、三地委党校四个单位，即提拔了二百三十二人。此外在训练后各县都试作了若干村子的结束土改实验。凡此一切，都给秋后结束土改，民主整党等工作准备了顺利的条件。
    从各地训练结果看，有那些经验值得吸取呢？
    第一、领导上恳切适当的自我批评与启发下边同志开展自我批评运动相结合，才能打破一切对整党方针的怀疑与否定。
    上半年实验村在整党方式上，普遍对农村支部党员采用了无分别的一律停止活动，解除职务、交给成份复杂的群众大会或没有党员参加的整党委员会和群众代表会去整；为给群众撑腰，甚至不许党员申辩，党员的处分与否或处分轻重，也都由群众决定。凡此一切，都引起了党员的不满，并在思想上产生了许多糊涂观念，如“当党员不如当群众”，“工作不如不工作”，“积极不如不积极”，“十种好顶不着一种坏”等。训练班初期，一定会碰到这种不满情绪的发泄，领导者这时必须要耐心的倾听他们的申诉，一定时机再作恳切适当的自我批评，承认上半年整党由于在当时揭发党内严重不纯的空气中，失掉了对支部情况的清醒分析，过低估计了党的基础，信任贫农团超过了信任支部，所以将党员放在一边让群众自由去整，结果损害了党在群众中的威信，这个在整党方法上所犯的尾巴主义错误，今后不可再犯。领导上这种恳切适当的自我批评，经验证明它会给党员以极大的感动，对促进党内团结作用很大，也只有在这个基础上才能进一步诱导党员转向讨论党与群众关系，和党是不是就不需要整了的问题。较好的党员这时便会站在党的立场上，逐渐向一切否认整党者展开思想斗争，并结合自我批评，举出农村党员脱离群众的事实，证明整党之必需。有些训练班在这点上搞得很好。如涉县训练班中在驳斥“整党是多余的”论战中，有一村干反省说：“运动中，上级只批准我村斗封建八户，可是为了想多分东西，支部又私自加了六户，都是中农，为了欺骗上级，故意说他有剥削，这种欺党害民的事情，再不整就不得了啦。”某村干反省说：“党员集体偷了果实，暗自订了‘谁也不许露，违者白刀进红刀出’的条件”。象这样的事实很多。这种自我批评的开展，党内不纯现象的适当揭发，才能使否定整党者的观点受到批判，又可使每个党员自觉到整党之必要。
    党必须整的问题解决了，如何整便成了每个党员所最关心的问题，解决此一问题的经验是引导党员结合实际讨论，认识党内存在不纯的原因，主要是过去党内太缺少批评与自我批评，要解决已存的不纯，必须靠党内的批评与自我批评，这是整党的基本方法。吸收群众代表参加，是为了协助我们，不是代替我们自己整，也代替不了。象斗地主一样的将党员交给群众自由去整，那是错误的。
    各地训练班经验证明，凡照上述步骤作了的，收效一般较大；反之，领导上压制党员控诉自由，同时又不作自我批评，或只作抽象的装样的自我批评，即要下边作自我批评，是不易办好的。同时领导上无分寸囫囵吞枣的不启发下边作自我批评，一切错误都由领导者包揽的自我批评，不但不解决问题，反会加深混乱。
    第二、必须从发展生产观点出发，引导党员干部自觉结束土改工作的重要，正确执行结束土改政策。
    训练班转向学习结束土改政策时，一般都从群众今年与去年的生产比较着手，参加学习的人便会举出许多事实，说明群众生产急待领导。接着传达区党委关于结束土改、保证地权、发土地证、齐心闹生产的决定，大家对此方针一致同意；但对过去已被扫地出门的地主富农及一部份中农该怎样办呢？则意见很分歧。讨论时有的主张不必管他，给地他还嫌累呢；有的说：再给地主富农地，必然动别人的，麻烦更多，不如不动；有的认为遗留的果实地、公地、庙地、学田地有多少算多少，缺下上级想办法。有的反驳说，不认真解决，偷人抢人、伸手拿咱的不安现象永无法消除。有的说解决好，地从哪里来？有的说，按全村每人平均土地标准算出，高过了都往出拿。争论中抵抗安补的思想很厉害，绝对平均思想也存在。这两种思想，训练班中必须加以反对；但克服此种倾向的有效方法，必须一面教育党员干部，了解区党委关于分别补偿与土地来源的规定；另一方面还必须让村干依照各村具体情况拟定安补计划，交县区审核批准，才能最后保证结束土改政策的正确实现。
    经验证明，凡照上述步骤作了的，无不收效很大；反之，不重视为什么结束土改的教育，单纯任务观点，必然会引起社会的混乱。在结束土改的政策上，若只片面强调安补，必然要产生绝对平的思想；如片面的反对绝对平，也很容易产生忽视安补。这两种偏向的有效防止方法，不是在训练班中的泛泛空论可以解决的，决定的环节是在具体执行结束土改时，村子里计划的细密制定与慎重审核。
    第三、训练中必须将调整村子里的关系作为重要内容之一。
    群众中的极端民主化偏向，当前还很严重，有些则公然抵抗出差、纳粮、开会，甚至搅扰社会秩序，无人敢于制止，不少人认为民主就可不守法，使村干束手无策。其次，村子里复杂的宗派斗争闹不团结，使一切决议无从实施。再次，村子里支部、人代会、村政权、农会等各种组织间的关系搞不清，这些都是农村中当前急需解决的问题。然各地训练中大都将它忽略了，因而在结束土改的实践中，有些地方就不得不因村内问题的纠纷，而将土改结束工作停止下来，转而先去解决它，这可算是一个教训。
    第四、训练班的一般领导经验。
    各地训练班经验都不少，但有几点是可以通用的：（一）调动学员最好是集团式的调，一村一次调六七个，这样既便于了解全村情况，又易于直接调整彼此间的关系，回村后也易于形成一个有力的集团领导，比一村一次来一两个要有效。（二）开办人数众多的训练班，必须有一批思想上通了的干部作骨干，收效才大。有些县将县区村干部都放在一齐搞是不好的。（三）学习方法一般采用先提出问题大家酝酿，在酝酿的基础上，结合其思想渐次传达党的决定，学员易于消化。反之，上大课照套传达生效很小。（四）学习内容排列上，一般先学整党政策，再学土改政策，较顺乎干部思想情绪。（五）此外在生活上要热情照顾，枝节问题上的精心注意，都很重要。
