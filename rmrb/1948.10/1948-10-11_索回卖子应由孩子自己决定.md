　　Claiming Back a Sold Child Should Be Decided by the Child Themselves
    To the Editor:
    Wang Shigen from Wang Fuquan Village, Second District, Taixi County, fled with his entire family to Shanxi due to famine in the thirty-second year [of the Republic, i.e. 1943]. He sold his son to Cui Gengwang in Shangben Village, southwest of Qin County, Shanxi. In the spring of the thirty-fifth year [of the Republic, i.e. 1946], Wang Shigen went there once, intending to reclaim his son, but at that time the area was still a guerrilla zone, and his son did not acknowledge the father-son relationship, so he did not take him back. Now Wang Shigen still wants to reclaim his son. If his son still does not acknowledge the father-son relationship, can the local government find a solution?
    Wang Xiaoting, First Special District Office of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region
    Answer: The buying and selling of sons by both Wang Shigen and Cui Gengwang is illegal. However, Wang Shigen sold his son to escape the famine and survive, and Cui Gengwang bought the son to raise him and support his household. In the old society, during famine years, neither party was considered to have committed a crime. Now that Wang Shigen wants to reclaim his child, the government cannot force Cui Gengwang to return the child. It should be decided by the child themselves. The government can mediate a solution. If the child returns to his original parent, Wang Shigen should appropriately compensate Cui Gengwang for the child's upbringing expenses.

　　索回卖子应由孩子自己决定编辑同志：
    泰西县二区王傅泉村，王世庚于三十二年因灾荒所迫全家逃至山西，并将其子卖于山西沁县城西南上本村崔更旺，三十五年春，王世庚曾前往一次，意欲将子要回，但当时该地仍属游击区，其子并不承认父子关系，因此也未要回。现在王世庚还是想去要子、其子如仍不承认父子关系该地政府能否设法解决？
    冀鲁豫一专署王晓亭
    答　王世庚和崔更旺双方买卖儿子，都是不合法的，但王世庚为了逃荒求生出卖儿子，崔更旺为了买得儿子抚养成人，支撑门户，这种情况在旧社会，于灾荒年间，两方都不算犯罪行为。现在王世庚愿要回孩子，但政府不能强制崔更旺将孩子送回，应由孩子自己决定，政府可调处解决，如孩子归回原主，亦应由王世庚适当赔偿崔更旺对孩子的抚养费。
