　　Organizing Workshops According to Production Characteristics
  　Bazhou Cooperative Can Solve Difficulties for the Masses
    [Taihang News] The Bazhou Village Cooperative in the first district of Xiyang was established in March 1946. The characteristic of Bazhou Village is the lack of land. Before the war, there were fifty or sixty handicraft workers among the village's 303 households. Based on this characteristic, in addition to using some funds to supply the masses with daily necessities, the cooperative used most of its funds to organize handicrafts, organizing two workshops (hemp shop, carpentry factory) with six workers. In terms of operation, they earned wages on a daily basis. The cooperative cadres' treatment was a 30/70 profit split. This year, they earned more than 360,000 yuan. The workers earned a net 34 shi of millet, and both parties benefited. In 1947, the capital was further expanded, and the carpentry factory increased to more than ten people. By July, felt tent and shoe shops were also organized. Operating in this way until the end of the year, after expenses, the industry earned a total of more than 4 million yuan. In addition, the cooperative did not have large debts. Even if there were debts, they were repaid on time according to the situation. Cooperative Director Guang Chenggui first paid attention to the fact that cadres did not owe debts, and the masses also rarely owed debts, so the cooperative developed smoothly. This year, the carpentry factory has had twelve or thirteen people every day. The operating method is to pay wages according to the finished products, not fixed, and the workers agree very much. The hemp shop often has four workers, who are paid according to the number of catties spun. The finished products from each workshop must be sold outside, so the transportation of the masses is also combined. In the first half of the year alone, the masses earned more than 600,000 yuan from transportation. Last year, in order to solve the difficulties of the masses' illnesses, the cooperative also established a pharmacy in the village, with one doctor seeing patients and dispensing medicine. At the same time, there are also dedicated people responsible for purchasing daily necessities such as oil, salt, and cotton in the cooperative. The masses save labor, spend less money, and also benefit greatly. In terms of assisting textiles, the cooperative hired mechanics to make tools and open training classes. Now the village has developed to 30 machines and fifty weavers. The cooperative purchases raw materials and promotes finished products, leading the continued development of textiles. From January to now, after calculation, the entire cooperative has earned more than 4 million yuan, excluding expenses.
    Now the masses are very satisfied with the cooperative. Guang Xixiang's father said: "The cooperative is for our benefit. If we have difficulties, the cooperative can help us." (Zhao Mangxiao, Wang Guike, Zheng Buyun)

　　按生产特点组织作坊
  　巴州合作社能给群众解决困难
    【太行讯】昔阳一区巴州村合作社是四六年三月份建立的。巴州村的特点是土地缺乏，全村三百零三户，在战前就有五六十个手工业工人。根据这特点，合作社除用一部资金供给群众购买日用品外，大部用到组织手工业方面，组织了两个作坊（麻铺、木工厂）有六个工人，经营上是按日工赚工资。社内干部的待遇是三七分红，这一年共赚大洋三十六万余元。工人净赚小米三十四石，双方都得到利益。一九四七年资本更扩大木工厂增到十余人，到七月又组织了毡房、鞋铺，这样经营到年底，除消耗，工业上共赚四百余万元。另外合作社没有大的赊欠，即便赊帐也是根据情形按期归还。社长光成贵首先注意干部不欠帐，群众也很少欠，因此合作社得到顺利发展。今年的木工厂，每日有十二、三人，经营方式是按所出的成品给工资，不是固定的，工人很同意。麻铺经常有四个工人，按纺的斤数给工资。各个作坊出的成品要到外面推销，这样群众的运输也结合搞起来了，仅前半年群众运输即赚洋六十余万元。去年合作社为了解决群众疾病困难，又在本村建立了一座药铺，有医生一人看病抓药。同时社内的日用品如油盐棉花等，也有专人负责购买，群众省下工也多掏不了钱，也有很大利益。在扶助纺织上，合作社请机师打工具开训练班等，现在全村已发展到三十架机，五十来个织妇，合作社购买原料推销成品，领导纺织继续发展。从正月到现在计算了一下，除消耗全社共赚洋四百余万元。
    现在群众对合作社很满意，光喜享父亲说：“合作社就是给咱们谋利益的，咱有了困难，社内能给咱走动一下”。（赵忙小、王贵科、正步云）
