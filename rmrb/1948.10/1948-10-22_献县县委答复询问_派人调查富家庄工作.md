　　Xian County Party Committee Replies to Inquiry:
　　Sending Personnel to Investigate Work in Fujiazhuang
Editor:
    Regarding the article "Problems with Work in Fujiazhuang, Xian County" published in the People's Daily No. 93, our county immediately dispatched personnel to investigate, and concluded that Liu Qingrui's reflections were factual. The main reasons were:
    (1) The district cadres Zhou Jiafa and Li Shangmin, who were in charge of land reform at the time, harbored excessively left-leaning egalitarian ideas, one-sidedly emphasizing satisfying the demands of poor and landless peasants. However, in reality, the poor and landless peasants did not demand this; rather, it was the cadres' subjective imposition, not following the mass line. It was initially stipulated that anyone with an average of more than 3.8 mu of land per person should contribute land (the village had an average of 4.4 mu per person, including alkaline land; excluding alkaline land, it was 3.8 mu, a point on which Liu Qingrui's reflection was incorrect). According to this standard, more than 80 households were initially designated to contribute land. Later, because the district disagreed, the standard was changed to 5 mu, reducing the number of households to 33. Moreover, each household had to contribute good land, including several mu of wheat seedlings. Those who disagreed were detained. For example, Liu Zhenrong, who had planted 7 mu of wheat, was forced to give up 4 mu. Liu Qingrui himself received 2 mu of wheat seedlings.
    (2) It is also true that all the old cadres were treated as stones and moved away together. Only the branch secretary, Gong Shuliang, remained, and he did not dare to speak. The chairman of the poor peasant association, Gong Fuquan and Shao Fulin, were not year-round laborers and were somewhat unfamiliar with farming. These issues have been corrected, and the new and old cadres have begun to unite.
    (3) Cadres distributed excessive amounts of fruit. They used the excuse that the fruit had not been clearly divided, so Shao Fulin did not return the extra 600,000 yuan. However, the price difference between 600,000 yuan at that time and 600,000 yuan at wheat harvest was significant. The masses were very dissatisfied. The distribution was based on three grades and nine levels, but in practice, it was three grades, with the first grade picking first, followed by the second and third grades. The masses were also dissatisfied.
    (4) The wasteland was not distributed at the time and was subsequently flooded. Now, Liu Qingrui has sown wheat on that land.
    Regarding the problems in Fujiazhuang, the county party committee has instructed the district to send personnel to cooperate in resolving them clearly during the conclusion of land reform.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xian County Party Committee, 17th
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　
    Editor's Note: Based on the opinions of the masses, the Xian County Party Committee conducted a thorough and comprehensive review of the work in Fujiazhuang, supplemented new information, identified the causes of the problems, and immediately sent a reply after correcting and addressing them. This attitude of humbly listening to the opinions of the masses and the practice of earnestly conducting reviews and making corrections are helpful for improving work. It is worthy of learning by all localities.

### 献县县委答复询问　派人调查富家庄工作

　　献县县委答复询问
  　派人调查富家庄工作编辑同志：
    关于人民日报第九十三号发表的“献县富家庄工作有毛病”一文。我县即派人前去调查，认为刘庆瑞所反映的是实情。主要原因：
    （一）当时该区领导土改的区干部周加法栗尚敏同志，是存在了过左的大平分思想，片面强调满足贫雇农要求；但实际上贫雇农要求也不是这样，而是干部主观包办，不走群众路线。先规定：每人平均土地超过三亩八的，须向外出地（该村连碱地在内，平均每人四亩四，除去碱地是三亩八，这点刘庆瑞反映的不对），按此标准当时确定了须出地者八十多户；后来因区里不同意。又以超过五亩为标准，改为三十三户。并且每户必须出好地，其中还得出几亩麦苗。谁不同意者即予扣押。如刘振荣种了七亩麦子，硬叫拿出四亩来；刘庆瑞他本身即拿到二亩麦苗。
    （二）当时把旧干部都当成了石头一齐搬，也是事实。只剩下支书巩书良，也不敢说话。贫农团主席巩福全邵福林都不是常年劳动的人，种地上有些外行，并不是怎样的不好，这些都已作了纠正，新老干部已开始团结。
    （三）干部多分果实。他们以果实还没有分清为借口，所以邵福林多分的六十万元老不退。可是这时六十万与麦熟时六十万物价即差多了。群众非常不满意。分时是按三等九级，实际是三等，一级先挑二级三级后挑，群众也不满意。
    （四）荒地问题，当时没有分下去，即被水淹了，现在该地已由刘庆瑞耩上了麦子。
    富家庄之问题，县委已指示该区派人前去，配合结束土改中解决清了。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　献县县委　十七日
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　
    编者按：献县县委根据群众意见，对富家庄的工作进行了深入的全面检查，补充了新的情况，找出发生毛病的原因，并于纠正处理后，立即来函答复。象这种虚心听取群众意见的态度，认真进行检查纠正的作风，对改进工作是有帮助的。值得各地学习。
