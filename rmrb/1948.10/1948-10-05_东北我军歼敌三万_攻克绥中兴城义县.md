Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 3rd: Following the great victory of liberating Jinan and annihilating 100,000 enemies, the People's Liberation Army has achieved another tremendous victory on the Northeast battlefield. On September 28th, 29th, and October 1st, the Northeast People's Liberation Army successively captured the important strongholds of Suizhong, Xingcheng, and Yixian on the Guandong section of the Beining Railway, completely annihilating the defending enemy troops, including the Temporary 20th Division, the 2nd Regiment of the Temporary 60th Division, the directly subordinate regiment of the 54th Army, and the cavalry detachment. This has placed the enemy's command centers in western Liaoning, Jinzhou and Jinxi, completely under siege. This offensive was launched simultaneously on the night of September 12th along a 380-kilometer front from Yixian to Tangshan on the Beining Railway. By the 21st, the PLA in the section from Luanxian to Qinhuangdao inside the pass had successively recovered Changli County and several important stations and strongholds such as Liushouying, Beidaihe, Shimen, and Houfengtai, annihilating over 3,000 enemies. Another PLA unit launched an attack in the section from Yixian to Linyu outside the pass. On September 12th, it advanced between Yixian and Jinzhou, cutting off the enemy's retreat from Yixian. On the same day, it also surrounded the enemies in Xingcheng and Suizhong. On the 24th, it occupied the positions between Xingcheng and Jinxi, annihilating about one regiment of the enemy's Temporary 57th Division. On the 25th, it annihilated nearly 4,000 men of the 93rd Army 15 li north of Jinzhou. Including the annihilation of the enemies in the three cities of Yixian, etc., the enemy annihilated since the launch of the offensive has reached approximately 30,000. Currently, the 300-plus li section of the Beining Railway from Yixian to the forward section east of Shanhaiguan, with the exception of the two isolated points of Jinzhou and Jinxi, is entirely under the control of the People's Liberation Army.
