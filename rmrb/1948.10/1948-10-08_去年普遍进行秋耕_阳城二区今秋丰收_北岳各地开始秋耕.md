　　【Taiyue Electric】This year, Yangcheng Second District has a bumper millet harvest. The district has more than 30,000 mu of millet fields, which have now been completely harvested. A total of more than 49,900 shi of millet has been threshed, with an average yield of 1.64 dou per mu for both good and bad land. According to the historical harvest situation in the Second District, this year is close to a 90% harvest, and generally higher than last year. The best example is Liu's family in Yongshan Village, who harvested 1.6 old shi of millet from one mu of land, equivalent to 4.48 shi in the market. He and his son said, "Neither of us has ever grown such good millet." The millet grown by Village Chief Liu Xueqi of Shangtun Village is very lush, and the masses say "it can be used to worship ancestors!" (meaning great joy). The good harvest in this district this year is due to the even distribution of rainfall, as well as the extensive autumn cultivation carried out throughout the district last year. Furthermore, all 25 administrative villages in the district generally carried out correction campaigns, which stabilized the morale of the masses. Therefore, despite some sloppy cultivation during the spring plowing, the morale of the masses improved when weeding. In addition, the war support tasks were lighter, and generally more work was done than last year. The millet was weeded twice in general, except in a few places, and three times in 15,000 mu (about half).
　　【Northern Yue Electric】Autumn harvests have been largely completed in various parts of Northern Yue, and autumn cultivation and wheat sowing have now begun. As reported on the 20th of last month, the crops in the mountainous areas of Hunyuan have already been harvested. Except for the seventh and ninth districts below the mountains, where spring reclamation was rushed and a large part of the crops were not yet fully mature and the work started late, most of the millet in other districts has been harvested, and more than half of the millet has been harvested, and sorghum is just beginning to be harvested. With the earnest help of the staff of the organizations and the masses, the crops of military, industrial, and families of martyrs and families of militiamen going on expeditions have been largely harvested. According to reports from Guangling, Lingqiu and other counties before the 20th of last month, the oats and millet in the mountainous areas have been harvested, and they are now digging yams and harvesting beans; the villages in the plain areas are also rushing to harvest millet and sorghum. In addition, some areas of Guangling, Lingqiu, and Hunyuan have begun autumn cultivation. 40% of the summer fields in the third district of Guangling have been cultivated, and about 30% of the summer fields in the first, second, third, and sixth districts of Lingqiu have also been cultivated, and most of the pea fields have been cultivated twice. According to a message from the Fifth Special District on the 21st of last month, about one-third of the millet fields in the counties of the district have been harvested, and 40% to 50% of the corn and sorghum have been harvested. Except for Hunyuan, a total of more than 200,000 mu of cotton fields were planted in the entire district this year, and the output is estimated to be no less than 60 jin per mu. The first and third districts of Mancheng have also begun autumn cultivation. The autumn harvest in the plains of Zhengding and Xingtang in the Fourth Special District has been largely completed. Many places have achieved harvesting one piece and cultivating another. The crops are good this year, with a good harvest of beans, and each mu of wheat stubble land produces 5 or 6 large dou of grain. Sweet potatoes, buckwheat, and vegetables are all showing signs of a bumper harvest. The yields of corn and millet in dry land are also better than last year.

　　去年普遍进行秋耕  阳城二区今秋丰收
    北岳各地开始秋耕
    【太岳电】阳城二区今年谷子丰收。全区共有谷地三万余亩，现已全部收割完毕。共打谷子四万九千九百余石，好坏地平均每亩收谷一石六斗四升。按二区历年收获情形，今年接近十成年景，一般都比去年收的高。最好的如永善村刘某家，有一亩谷子打了老石一石六斗，合市石四石四斗八升。他和他儿子说：“咱们爷手里也没长过这样好的谷。”上屯村村长刘学奇的谷长的很旺，群众都说“可以祭祖啦！”（大喜的意思）该区今年收成好的原因，除雨水调匀以外，就是去年全区普遍进行秋耕。再就是全区二十五个行政村都普遍进行过纠偏，稳定了群众情绪。所以尽管春耕时有些地区耕作马虎，但锄苗时群众情绪即转高。加上战勤任务轻，一般较去年加了工，谷子除个别地方外，普遍锄了二遍，里面有一万五千亩（约占半数）锄了三遍。
    【北岳电】北岳各地秋收大部完成，现已开始秋耕种麦。上月二十日报导，浑源山地庄稼已经割完，川下除七、九两区今春抢荒，较大部分庄稼还未完全成熟动手较迟外，其他区的黍糜大部割完，谷子已割了一半以上，高粱正开始收割。军、工、烈属及出征民兵家属的庄稼，在机关人员和群众认真帮助下大部已经收完。据广灵、灵邱等县上月二十日前报告，山地的莜麦谷子均已收完，现正刨山药、割豆类；川下区村亦正突击谷子、高粱的收割。此外广灵、灵邱、浑源部分地区，已开始进入秋耕，广灵三区的夏田已耕了百分之四十，灵邱一、二、三、六区的夏田也耕了百分之卅左右，豌豆地则大部已耕过了两遍。五专上月廿一日消息，该区各县的谷田已收割者达三分之一左右，玉茭高粱收完的占百分之四十至五十。除浑源外，全区今年共种棉田二十万余亩，产量估计每亩不少于六十斤。满城一、三等区也开始着手秋耕工作。四专正（定）、行（唐）平原的秋收已大部完成，不少地方做到了收一块耕一块，年景是豆类收成好，麦茬地每亩产粮五、六大斗，红薯荞麦及蔬菜都呈显丰收景象，旱地的玉茭、谷子收成也都比去年好。
