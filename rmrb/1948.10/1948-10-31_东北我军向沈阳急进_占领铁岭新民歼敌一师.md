Xinhua News Agency, Liaoxi Front, 29th: Our troops occupied Tieling yesterday, completely annihilating the defending enemy division. Our Liaoxi forces occupied Xinmin this morning. Our forces are advancing rapidly towards Shenyang from all directions, and the city will soon be occupied by us.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Dahu Mountain Front, Liaoxi, Urgent Telegram, 28th, 10:00 AM: The Northeast Field Army swiftly, decisively, and completely annihilated the enemy's main force, the Liao Yaoxiang Corps, achieving a victory of decisive significance for the liberation of all of Northeast China. After our Jinzhou victory and the liberation of Changchun, the Northeast Chiang bandits were like fish in a cauldron, panicking and at a loss. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit frantically flew to Shenyang several times to personally command the Liao Yaoxiang Corps, which was continuing to advance towards Jinzhou, to move south from Zhangwu and Xinlitun, attempting to escape. On the 24th, it advanced to the Heishan and Dahu Mountain area, where it was stubbornly resisted by our troops and made no progress. The enemy was panicked and confused, using its rear guard as its vanguard, attempting to escape back to Xinmin and Shenyang, but was intercepted head-on by our troops on the line of Lijia Wopeng and Banlamen (southwest of Xinmin), cutting off its retreat. At this point, the enemy was trapped in our heavy encirclement. Our troops then began a massive encirclement and annihilation battle at 7:00 PM on the 25th in the area of more than eighty li square east of Dahu Mountain, west of the Raoyang River, north of Tai'an, and south of Wudian. The enemy fled in all directions, unable to escape our net. Several armies were mixed together, and they were captured and annihilated one by one by our army. The battle lasted only two days and nights, and by 5:00 AM this morning (the 28th), the battle was completely resolved. The enemy's New 30th Division and 50th Division of the New 1st Army, the New 22nd Division, 169th Division, and the 2nd Regiment of the Provisional 62nd Division of the New 6th Army, the 14th Division, Provisional 54th Division, and Provisional 59th Division of the New 3rd Army, the 87th Division and 91st Division of the 71st Army, the 105th Division of the 49th Army, the 346th Regiment of the 79th Division, the 3rd Brigade of the Reorganized 207th Division of the 6th Army, and the 195th Division, a total of twelve full divisions, two full regiments, four army headquarters, one corps headquarters, and a heavy artillery regiment, were completely wiped out. The number of prisoners is countless. As of the time of sending the telegram, the captured officers identified include: Wen Xiaoshan, Deputy Commander of the New 1st Army and Commander of the New 30th Division, Luo Ying, Commander of the New 22nd Division of the New 6th Army, Zhang Yuxian, Commander of the 109th Division, Xu Ying, Commander of the 14th Division of the New 3rd Army, Song Benwei, Commander of the 55th Division, Huang Yan, Commander of the 87th Division of the 71st Army, Deputy Commander, and many others. The results of the battle are still being investigated. (Attached picture)
