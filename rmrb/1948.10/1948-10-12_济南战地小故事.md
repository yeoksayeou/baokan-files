Jinan Battlefield Anecdotes

	On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival—the second day of launching the Jinan Campaign—the rapidly advancing People's Liberation Army (PLA) annihilated the 57th Regiment of the enemy's 83rd Division in Huaimutun, forty miles from Jinan. Under the clear moonlight, the PLA was searching for prisoners when a black car sped towards them on the road. The soldiers shouted, "Who's there? Stop!"
	The car stopped immediately, and a man jumped out shouting, "Don't misunderstand, I'm 106."
	Of course, the PLA knew whose code name this was. A squad leader immediately followed up with, "Are you the deputy regimental commander? Ah, we've been waiting for you!"
	"Yes, I am the deputy regimental commander; I just arrived for duty."
	In an instant, the platoon leader shouted "Hands up!" and searched him for weapons. A nearby soldier said, "Alright, report for duty right here; you won't be delayed."
	This "newly appointed" deputy regimental commander thus became a prisoner of the PLA. His name was Mao Longzhang, from Lianhua County, Jiangxi Province.
	On the night of September 23rd, after the PLA broke through the outer city of Jinan, the 2nd Battalion of a certain regiment, expanding rapidly into the depths, quickly reached outside the Puli Gate of the inner city. The enemy sent out three tanks in an attempt to outflank and counterattack. When the leading tank climbed to within three or four steps of him, Liu Peixun, the squad leader of the 6th Company, 4th Squad, deftly placed a package of explosives on the tank's head, but it didn't destroy it. The tank turned to escape. Another soldier quickly placed another package of explosives on the treads, and with a bang, the tank obediently lay still. The two following tanks had just turned to escape to the city gate, but the gate was blocked by fleeing Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who had panicked and collapsed. These two abandoned tanks, with no way to return, had no choice but to obediently stop outside the Puli Gate and become prisoners of the PLA.

　　济南战地小故事
    中秋节——发动解放济南战役的第二天——的晚上，神速发展攻势的解放军，在距离济南四十里的槐木屯歼灭了敌八十三师五十七团。明朗的月色下，解放军正在搜索俘虏，公路上迎面驰来了一辆黑色汽车。战士们吆喝一声：“那里的？站住！”
    车子立即停下来，钻出一个人来高喊：“不要误会，我是一零六。”
    解放军当然知道这是谁的代号，一位班长马上接着就问：“你是副团长吗？啊，候驾好久了！”
    “是呀，我就是副团长，刚来到差的。”
    刹那间排长猛喊一声“举手”，搜出了他的武器，旁边的一位战士说：“好吧，就地到差，收到不误。”
    这位“上任”的副团长就这样做了解放军的俘虏。他叫毛龙章，江西莲花县人。
    九月二十三日夜，解放军突破济南外城后，向纵深扩展的某团二营，迅速打到内城普利门外。敌人出动了三辆坦克，企图迂回反击。当带头的一辆坦克爬到了隔他只有三四步远时，六连四班长刘培训，就敏捷地把手里一包炸药放在坦克的头上，但没有把它炸坏。坦克掉头想逃。另一个战士迅速地又把一包炸药放在轮带上，轰的一声，坦克就老老实实地躺下不动了。尾随的两辆刚掉头逃到城门口，但城门却被吓慌溃退的蒋军堵塞住了。这两辆被摈弃的坦克，欲归无路，只好乖乖地停在普利门外，做了解放军的俘虏。
