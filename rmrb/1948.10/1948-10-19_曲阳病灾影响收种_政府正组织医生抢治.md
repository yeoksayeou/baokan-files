[North Yue News] Just as the autumn harvest and wheat planting season are in full swing, a serious disease outbreak has occurred in Quyang. In the villages of Nan Shuiyu and Shachen in the Fifth District, fourteen children have died from illness in the past twenty days. In Chikan Village, eight people have died in just over ten days. In Wu Hui Village, out of 146 households, 42 have sick individuals, with two families completely incapacitated and unable to work. The diseases are mostly plague and dysentery. Upon learning of this, the county government immediately instructed all areas to strengthen defenses, urging cadres to properly organize production in disease-stricken villages, expand pharmacies, and ensure that the masses can access medicine without difficulty. Simultaneously, they swiftly organized local doctors to provide treatment. The Fourth District has already organized doctors to go to the countryside, and the county pharmacy has dispatched doctors daily for emergency assistance. On September 24th, the Fifth District Party Committee and District Office convened an emergency meeting with ten traditional Chinese medicine doctors and pharmacy cadres to study the plague situation and discuss treatment methods. To quickly cure the disease and facilitate autumn plowing and wheat planting, a medical association was established, and it was decided that doctors would go to the countryside for public service to treat the sick. The village should provide work points; a few days in the countryside would equal a few work points. Currently, ten doctors have been divided into five groups (two doctors per group) and dispatched to disease-stricken villages for emergency treatment. (Zhao Lingjun, Zhang Jinhai, Zhao Deben)

    【北岳讯】正值秋收、种麦农忙之际，曲阳发生严重病灾。五区南水峪、砂城两村二十天内因病已死小孩十四名。赤岸村十几天就死了八人。五会村一百四十六户，就有四十二户有病人，其中有两户全家完全病倒不能生产。疾病大都是瘟症、痢疾。县政府闻悉后，除立刻指示各地严加防御，干部要好好组织病灾村的生产，扩大药社，使群众吃药不遭难外，同时迅速组织本地医生前往治疗。四区已组织医生下乡，县药社特派医生每日出发急救。五区区委、区公所于九月二十四日召集中医十名及药社干部开紧急会议，研究了瘟疾情形，讨论出治疗办法。为了迅速把病治好，以利秋耕种麦，特成立医联会，并决定医生为公下乡治病，本村应给计工，下几天乡顶几个工。现十名医生已分五组（每组二人）分别下乡前往病灾村庄急治。　　　　　　　　（赵岭峻、张进海、赵德本）
