Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 8th. The Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China has recently promulgated the "Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction Program," the original text of which is as follows:

	(1) In order to meet the current needs of farmers in newly liberated areas, improve farmers' lives, develop agricultural production, and strive for a swift victory in the People's Liberation War, this Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction Program is specially formulated.
	(2) Rent Reduction:
		A. All land rented by landlords, old-style rich peasants, and all public land, school land, ancestral halls, temples, and churches, regardless of the form of tenancy, shall uniformly implement "25% rent reduction," that is, reduce the original rent by 25%. Local governments may formulate implementation measures based on this principle and local specific circumstances.
		B. For urban workers, impoverished self-employed individuals, and impoverished families of revolutionary soldiers and widowed and orphaned individuals, etc., who rent out a small amount of land due to lack of labor (not exceeding the average amount of land occupied by local middle peasants), the government and farmers' associations may negotiate to reduce or not reduce the rent as appropriate.
		C. All by-products of rented land that originally belonged entirely to the farmers shall remain as they were. If the landlord and tenant originally shared the profits, the reduction shall be made by "25%" according to the original ratio. If they originally belonged entirely to the landlord, they shall be distributed proportionally with the grain.
		D. Rent shall be paid uniformly after the harvest of the product. Pre-collection of rent is prohibited, and no additional exploitation of labor or property is allowed.
		E. All arrears of rent from previous years shall be waived.
		F. All rent deposits shall be abolished. All rent deposits that have been collected shall be returned to the farmers. When returning, they shall be converted according to the price of the goods at the time of payment.
		G. The rental relationship between farmers (referring to poor and middle peasants, including wealthy middle peasants) shall be based on the principle of solidarity and mutual assistance, and shall be negotiated by both parties and handled through the farmers' association.
		H. After rent reduction, the right to tenancy should be effectively guaranteed. Those with perpetual tenancy rights in contracts or customs shall continue to be valid. Those without perpetual tenancy rights should be encouraged to establish long-term (e.g., more than five years) contracts between landlords and tenants, so that tenants can develop production with peace of mind. During the effective period of the contract, the landlord shall not take back the land for self-cultivation, subletting, mortgage, or sale. After the expiration of the contract, the original tenant shall have the priority to lease, mortgage, or buy when the landlord recruits tenants, mortgages, or sells. If landlords and old-style rich peasants need to take back the land for self-cultivation or hire people to cultivate it for livelihood, they should also take care of the original tenants' lives, extend the tenancy period, or only return part of the tenancy.
		I. After rent reduction, the government and the farmers' association may, according to the principle of voluntariness, appropriately adjust tenancy rights to increase the amount of land cultivated by poor farmers with too little cultivated land in order to maintain their livelihood.
		J. After rent reduction, the old contract should be withdrawn and a new contract should be established by both parties. The landlord shall reduce the rent according to the contract, and the tenant shall pay the rent according to the contract. If there is a poor harvest due to irresistible disasters (war, flood, wind, drought, insect pests, etc.), it should be reduced or exempted as appropriate.
	(3) Debt Clearing and Interest Reduction:
		A. All old debts borrowed by farmers from landlords and old-style rich peasants in the past shall be cleared by calculating the monthly interest at half the rate. For long-term debts, they shall be cleared according to the following principles: stop interest and repay the principal when the interest is doubled (i.e., when the borrowed principal is 100 yuan and the interest paid has reached 100 yuan); stop paying both principal and interest when the interest is twice the principal (i.e., when the borrowed principal is 100 yuan and the interest paid has reached 200 yuan). After the old debt is cleared, the land mortgaged for the debt shall be returned to the farmers immediately. However, sales relationships established before the establishment of the democratic government shall remain unchanged.
		B. Debts between farmers (referring to poor and middle peasants, including wealthy middle peasants) shall be handled by the farmers themselves.
		C. For sales loans with agricultural products priced in advance (i.e., lending on green crops, which is essentially usury), the pre-determined price shall be invalid, and it shall be calculated according to the market price at the time of delivery, and another half-interest shall be added.
		D. All commodity transactions and commercial and industrial accounts shall be handled by the people themselves and shall not be included in the liquidation.
		E. In the future, interest rates on loans shall be freely agreed upon by both parties, and the government shall not limit the interest rate so that farmers can freely borrow money for emergency needs.
	(4) Handling of Distributed Land and Floating Property:
		A. Land already distributed to landlords and old-style rich peasants shall not be reversed, and violators shall be punished. However, it should be guaranteed that landlords and old-style rich peasants receive the same amount of land as farmers, and if it is insufficient, efforts should be made to make up for it.
		B. If, after farmers have been allocated land, the farmers and the original landlords or old-style rich peasants voluntarily change to a tenancy relationship, they may change it after registering with the government.
		C. Floating property already distributed to landlords or old-style rich peasants shall not be reversed, and violators shall be punished.
		D. If the land and property of farmers (including wealthy middle peasants) have been wrongly distributed, the households that have received them should be persuaded to return them voluntarily. If it is impossible to repay, other ways should be found to compensate.
		E. All industry and commerce confiscated from landlords, old-style rich peasants, and industrialists and merchants should be returned or compensated for by other means.
	(5) Handling of Several Special Land Issues:
		A. If landlords and old-style rich peasants take advantage of farmers' emergencies to buy and mortgage farmers' land at low prices, the farmers may request the government to investigate and recover it at the original price.
		B. If local bullies and evil gentry forcibly occupy farmers' land, and the farmers report it, and the farmers' association proves it, and the government's investigation confirms it, the farmers may recover it without compensation.
		C. If a person is indeed a counter-revolutionary criminal and is sentenced according to law by a government organ above the Commissioner's Office, the land of the person should be confiscated and distributed to landless and land-poor farmers. Family members who have not participated in criminal activities should retain the part they should receive.
		D. The land of landlords or old-style rich peasants who have fled may be managed by their relatives and friends on their behalf. If no one takes over the management, the government shall manage it on their behalf. After the original tenants reduce their rent according to law, they shall pay the rent to the government. After deducting the burden that should be paid, the government shall manage the remaining part on their behalf. After the landlord returns, both the land and the remaining part shall be returned to them together.
		E. Ancestral land, community land, public land, and school land shall be managed by a management committee organized by members of the clan, community, village, or region. Its income, in addition to paying the burden according to law, shall be used for public welfare after public discussion.
		F. The land belonging to religious groups shall remain unchanged. If no one is managing it, it can be handled according to the method of handling the land of fleeing landlords.
	(6) The Farmers' Association is the legal organ for handling rent reduction and interest reduction matters. All issues of land rent, usurious interest rates, and land adjustments in rural areas shall be handled by the government in conjunction with the Farmers' Association. The final decision-making power belongs to the government.
	(7) This program applies to rural areas and does not apply to cities.

　　适应新解放区农民目前需要
    中原局颁布减租减息纲领
    【新华社中原八日电】中共中原中央局顷颁布“减租减息纲领”，原文如下：
    （一）为适应新解放区农民目前的需要，改善农民生活，发展农业生产，争取人民解放战争迅速胜利，特制定减租减息纲领。
    （二）减租：
    甲、所有地主、旧式富农及一切公田、学田、祠堂、庙宇、教会所租之土地，不论任何租佃形式，一律实行“二五减租”，即按原租额减去二成半。各地政府得根据此原则及当地具体情形规定实行办法。
    乙、城市工人，贫苦的自由职业者，及贫苦的革命军人家属与鳏寡孤独等，因缺乏劳动力而出租之少量土地（不超过当地中农占有土地的平均数），可由政府及农会协议酌情少减或不减。
    丙、租地之一切副产物，原全归农民者，一律照旧。原业佃分益者，按原成“二五”减。原全归业主者，随粮按成分配。
    丁、地租一律于产物收获后交纳，禁止预收地租，尤不得索取其他一切劳力或财物的额外剥削。
    戊、陈年欠租一概免交。
    己、所有押租押金，一律取消。凡已收之押租押金，应一律退还农民。退还时，应按交纳时之物价折算。
    庚、农民与农民间（指贫农中农间，包括富裕中农在内）之租佃关系，本团结互助原则，由双方协议，经过农会处理之。
    辛、减租后应确实保障佃权。契约上、习惯上有永佃权者，继续有效。无永佃权者，应奖励业佃双方订立长期（例如五年以上）的契约，使佃农得安心发展生产。在契约有效期间，地主不得收回土地自耕、转租、出典或出卖。契约期满后，地主招人承租及出典、出卖时，原佃有承租、承典、承买之优先权。如地主及旧式富农为生活计，须收回土地自耕或雇人耕种者，亦应照顾原佃生活，延长佃期或只退佃一部。
    壬、减租后，政府与农会可根据自愿原则，适当地调剂佃权，使耕地太少之贫苦农民，增加一部分佃耕地，借以维生。
    癸、减租后应抽旧约，双方另立新约，地主按约减租，佃户按约交租。如因不可抗拒之灾害（战争、水灾、风灾、旱灾、虫灾等）而至歉收者，应酌情减免。
    （三）清债减息：
    甲、过去农民向地主、旧式富农所借旧债，一律按月利分半计算清债。其多年债款，应照下列原则清理之：利倍本（即借本百元已还息达一百元者）停息还本；利二倍于本（即借本百元已还利息达二百元者）本息停付。旧债清偿后，其抵押债务之土地应即交还农民。但在民主政府成立前，已成立买卖关系者不动。
    乙、农民与农民间（指贫农、中农间，包括富裕中农在内）债务，由农民自行处理之。
    丙、凡以农产物先行定价之买卖贷款（即放青苗、实质是高利贷），其先定之价无效，应照交货时市价扣算，另行分半补息。
    丁、凡货物买卖及工商业往来帐项，由人民自行处理，一概不在清理之列。
    戊、今后借贷利息，由双方自由约定，政府不限定利率，使农民能自由借贷济急。
    （四）已分配土地浮财之处理：
    甲、地主、旧式富农已被分配之土地，一律不得倒算，违者应受处罚。但应保证地主、旧式富农分得与农民同等之土地，不足者设法补足之。
    乙、农民已分得土地后，如农民与原业地主或旧式富农双方确系自愿改为租佃关系者，经双方向政府登记后得改变之。
    丙、地主或旧式富农已被分配之浮财，一律不得倒算，违犯应受处罚。
    丁、凡农民（包括富裕中农在内）土地、财物被错分者，应劝分得户自动退还。无法偿还时，另外设法弥补之。
    戊、凡没收地主、旧式富农及工商业者之工商业，应设法退还或另行设法弥补之。
    （五）若干特殊土地问题之处理：
    甲、凡地主及旧式富农，利用农民危急之际，贱价强买典当农民之土地，得由农民请求政府查明后，按原价收回。
    乙、凡豪绅恶霸恃强霸占农民之土地，经农民告发，农会证明，政府调查属实者，得由农民无代价收回。
    丙、凡确系反革命罪犯，由专员公署以上政府机关依法判处，其本人之土地应依法没收者，得没收分配给无地少地农民所有。其家属未参加罪恶活动者，应保留各人应得之部分。
    丁、凡逃亡地主或旧式富农之土地，得由其亲朋代管。无人承管者，由政府代管。原佃户依法减租后，向政府交租。政府扣除其应交负担外，代管其所余部分。俟地主归来后，连其土地一并发还之。
    戊、族地、社地、公地、学田，应由本族、本社、本村、本地区人员组织管理委员会管理之，其收入除依法缴负担外，应经公议充作公益事业之用。
    己、宗教团体所属土地，均不变动。如无人经营时，可按逃亡地主土地处理办法处理之。
    （六）农民协会为办理减租减息事宜的合法机关。农村中一切地租、高利贷债息及调整土地等问题，均由政府会同农民协会处理之。最后决定权属于政府。
    （七）本纲领适用于农村，不适用于城市。
