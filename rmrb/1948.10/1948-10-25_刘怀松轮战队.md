　　Protecting Your Passage
　　The Chiang bandits, trapped in the isolated stronghold of Jiaozuo, were constantly panicked by the obstructed Jiaozuo-Xinxiang Highway, but were unable to resolve it. Although they sent armed escorts when dispatching troops, they couldn't escape the clutches of the Liu Huaisong Combat Team.

　　On the night of August 27th, the 38th Division of the Chiang bandits in Jiaozuo sent a crack platoon to escort forty-seven nurses from the 44th Sanitation Brigade of the 102nd Ordnance Depot to Xinxiang. Knowing that it was difficult to move on this road, they were apprehensive about encountering the Liu Huaisong Combat Team. Sure enough, they ran into the Liu Huaisong Combat Team just as they reached Zhangfangpu. The Chiang bandits panicked and asked, "Which unit? What are you doing?" Liu Huaisong cleverly replied, "We are the Qian Dongcun Self-Defense Force, protecting your passage." Hearing that it was the Self-Defense Force, they turned fear into joy and said gratefully, "Right! Right! You came just in time!" They handed over the escort task to the Liu Huaisong Combat Team and hurriedly returned to Jiaozuo. The Liu Huaisong Combat Team escorted the forty-seven nurses to the democratic government, allowing them to see the light of day again.

　　Flying Mines and Cold Shots Together
　　The grain ears turned yellow, and the saying "Don't let the Chiang bandits grab a single grain" was firmly remembered in the hearts of every member of the Liu Huaisong Combat Team. They tirelessly went deep into the Jiaozuo-Xinxiang Highway, using the method of "plucking the heart of the tiger" to carry out flying mine explosions near the Chiang bandit strongholds. On the night of September 10th, Liu Huaisong, based on the terrain and the activity patterns of the Chiang bandits, set up a minefield and told the team members: "Listen for the sound of the mines, then use cold shots to shoot the enemy." At dawn the next day, a small group of Chiang bandits, as Liu Huaisong expected, stepped into the minefield. With a bang, the mine exploded, and four Chiang bandits were wounded. Immediately afterwards, cold shots rang out from all directions, and the Chiang bandits panicked. Just as they were trying to seize favorable terrain, the second mine exploded, scaring the bandits into a dilemma. The Chiang bandits in the Wangzhen stronghold were frightened and began firing randomly with mortars and machine guns. However, Liu Huaisong and his comrades, after blowing up seven Chiang bandits, had already moved away. They used this method to prevent the Chiang bandits from resting peacefully in their blockhouses.

　　Catch Another One
　　Once, Liu Huaisong, with four team members, rushed straight to Xiaozhang Village, half a li away from the enemy stronghold, to capture Chiang bandits who were harassing the area. As soon as they arrived, they discovered four Chiang bandits attempting to enter the village to loot the people's belongings. They fired several shots, wounding two, and immediately returned. However, everyone felt unsatisfied and unanimously demanded to catch another one. Without even eating, they rushed to the Jiaozuo-Xinxiang Highway, captured a messenger from a Jiaozuo township, seized a horse, and returned in triumph.

　　Fighting and Production Side by Side
　　The Liu Huaisong Combat Team always considers the interests of the masses. Wherever they operate, they help the masses with production. During the short twenty days of the autumn harvest protection struggle, they seized every spare moment amid the hectic fighting to help the masses weed fifty-two mu of land, connecting with the broad masses. Wherever they go, the masses unite with them, becoming a powerful armed force in the struggle against the enemy on the Jiaozuo-Xinxiang Highway.

　　刘怀松轮战队

  　掩护你们过路
    困守在焦作孤立据点内的蒋匪，经常因焦修公路不能畅通，恐慌得很，但又无法解决。在出动时，虽派武装掩护，但也逃不脱刘怀松轮战队的手。
    八月二十七日的夜晚，焦作蒋匪三十八师派了一个精悍排，掩护一○二兵站医院四十四卫生大队四十七名看护兵到新乡去。他们知道这条路上不好行动，提心吊胆的怕碰上刘怀松轮战队。果然，刚走到张方铺就和刘怀松轮战队碰了头，蒋匪们着慌得问：“哪一部分？干什么？”刘怀松机智的回答：“俺是前董村自卫团，掩护你们过路。”他们一听说是自卫团，就转惧为喜，感激的说：“对！对！你们来的真巧！”便把掩护任务交给了刘怀松轮战队，匆忙的返回焦作去了。刘怀松轮战队就这样的把四十七名看护兵护送到民主政府，使之重见天日了。
    飞雷冷枪一齐来
    谷穗黄了，“不让蒋匪抢走一颗粮”这句话，牢记在刘怀松轮战队每个人的心里头。他们昼夜不停的深入焦修公路上，以猛虎掏心的办法，在蒋匪据点附近进行飞行爆炸。九月十日夜晚，刘怀松根据地形与蒋匪活动规律，摆布下地雷阵，并告队员们说：“听着雷响，就用冷枪射击敌人。”第二天拂晓，一小股蒋匪果然不出刘怀松的所料，踏进了地雷阵，轰的一声，地雷爆炸，四个蒋匪挂了彩，紧接着四处冷枪响了起来，蒋匪们慌成一团，正想强占有利地形，哪晓得第二颗地雷又响了，吓得匪徒们进退两难。待王镇据点的蒋匪们害了怕，迫击炮机枪乱打起来。可是刘怀松和他的伙伴们炸倒了七个蒋匪后，早已转移走了。他们就用这种办法，经常使蒋匪们不能安然在炮楼里休息。
    再捉一个
    一次，刘怀松带着四个队员，一气突到距敌据点半里的小张村捕捉零散出扰的蒋匪，一到就发现四个蒋匪企图进村抢老百姓的东西，他们乓乓几枪，击伤了两个，便立即返回来了；可是大家感到美中不足，一致要求再捉一个，便连饭都不吃，又跑到焦修公路上，捉住了焦作乡镇的一个传令兵，缴获了一匹马，凯旋而归。
    一面战斗一面生产
    刘怀松轮战队处处为群众打算，他们活动到哪里，便在哪里帮助群众生产。在保秋斗争短短的二十天中，他们在匆忙的战斗中，抓住空隙时间帮助群众锄地五十二亩，联系了广大的群众。他们走到哪里，哪里的群众就和他们团结得一圪＠，成为焦修公路对敌斗争的一支有力的武装。
