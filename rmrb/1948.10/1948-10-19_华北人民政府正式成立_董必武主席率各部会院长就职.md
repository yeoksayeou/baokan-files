　　North China People's Government Officially Established
　　Dong Biwu, Chairman, Leads Department and Commission Heads in Taking Office
　　[Special Dispatch from this newspaper] The North China People's Government was officially established on the 26th of last month. Based on the resolution of the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference, the North China People's Government Committee, after five days of discussion from the 20th to the 24th, carefully elected the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the North China People's Government, appointed responsible cadres such as the heads of government departments, commissions, courts, and administrative offices; handled the resolutions and proposals transferred from the People's Representative Conference; and reviewed various draft regulations and procedures submitted for review by the joint office of the two border region governments (the original Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government). Finally, the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and heads of departments, commissions, courts, and administrative offices officially took office amidst the government cadres' celebration of our army's liberation of Jinan.

　　A total of twenty-two government committee members attended the meeting, exceeding the legal quorum. (Committee members Xu Xiangqian, Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu, Zhang Su, and Xue Xun were unable to attend due to official duties.) Comrade Dong Biwu, a 63-year-old veteran revolutionary and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, was elected Chairman of the government with the most votes; Comrade Bo Yibo, member of the CPC Central Committee and Political Commissar of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, was elected First Vice-Chairman; Mr. Lan Gongwu, a non-partisan, nationally renowned veteran educator, was elected Second Vice-Chairman; and Yang Xiufeng, former Chairman of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, was elected Third Vice-Chairman. Others included the famous legal expert and old professor Chen Jinkun, who was appointed President of the North China People's Court; university professors Huang Songling and Yu Li (Dong Luan'an) as Vice-Presidents of the North China Supervisory Court; water conservancy expert Xu Zheng as Deputy Director of the North China Water Conservancy Commission; industrial experts Liu Ding and Xu Daben as Deputy Ministers of the Public Enterprises Department; worker Comrade Zhao Guoqiang as Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau; and the heads of other departments, commissions, and courts, all of whom are capable cadres from various revolutionary classes who have long fought for national liberation, democracy, and freedom.

　　Government Committee Decides
　　All Systems and Regulations Must Move Towards Standardization
　　The meeting deeply discussed the government's organizational regulations. Based on the relatively stable environment in North China, it was believed that all systems and regulations of the North China People's Government should move from a guerrilla state to standardization. The meeting unanimously criticized the guerrilla habits brought about and developed in the past guerrilla environment, many of which were once correct and necessary (and some were also wrong), but which are no longer appropriate in today's situation of moving towards regular construction and must be corrected. Things must be done with systems and regulations to enhance administrative efficiency. Managing the administrative affairs of 45 million people while still adopting a rough-and-ready approach of not having rules for everything, only relying on conscience and memory to approve notes and make temporary decisions, is not only impossible but will definitely lead to failure. The North China People's Government organizational regulations, unanimously passed by the meeting, detailed the procedures for handling affairs, clearly defined the division of duties, responsibilities, and authorities, and meticulously planned the procedures. These are all necessary measures to strengthen North China's regular construction.

　　In order to increase the production of the people of North China and respond to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch on the existing basis," the conference repeatedly discussed the "New Agricultural Tax Regulations" and the newly drafted "Industrial and Commercial Income Tax Regulations" draft, which were principally approved by the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference and submitted to the government for revision and then promulgation. The new agricultural tax regulations stipulate: abolish the progressive agricultural tax before land reform, implement a tax system based on the proportion of normal annual yield, and do not increase taxes for those who increase production through deep plowing and careful cultivation and diligence; at the same time, do not levy sideline taxes to encourage the development of sideline production. This new regulation will greatly encourage the production enthusiasm of farmers after land reform. The Industrial and Commercial Income Tax Regulations stipulate: the highest progressive tax rate for industrial and commercial taxes should not exceed 25% of net profit. This specifically embodies our party's consistent policy of protecting industry and commerce.

　　The meeting also carefully studied the 163 proposals submitted by the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference to the North China People's Government Committee for handling, and decided to submit them to the relevant departments for research according to the three categories of "implementation," "discretionary handling," and "reference" in the Provisional People's Representative Conference's resolutions, and then submit them to the Chairman for approval and handling. The twenty-one draft regulations submitted by the joint office of the two border region governments for review were repeatedly reviewed and revised by the government committee in six review committees, and then passed by the government committee, and resolutions were made one by one. These proposals include various proposals on politics, military affairs, economy, culture, and education, which will more powerfully promote the construction of the North China Liberated Area and more powerfully support the victory of the national liberation war.

　　On the 26th, Chairman Dong Biwu, at the North China Government Inauguration Cadre Conference, more clearly indicated the tasks of the government in the future. He said: Now the People's Liberation War has been led to the KMT-controlled areas, and the land reform in North China has been basically completed. The central task of the North China People's Government in the future is to vigorously develop production, and, as Chairman Mao said, increase production by an inch. Chairman Dong then emphasized: The North China People's Government is a regular government, and it should have a set of regular systems and methods. Some people say this is a formality, but a regular government should pay attention to certain formalities. Not paying attention to formalities and only talking about conscience and memory will ruin things. We don't want the cumbersome official procedures of the past, but one thing is necessary: that is, everything must be reported. We must overcome the past state of disorganization and indiscipline where we didn't ask for instructions before doing things and didn't report after doing things. We are elected by the people, and we must be responsible to the people. The people require us to have systems and discipline in handling affairs. Without systems and discipline, we will definitely not be able to do things well. Vice-Chairman Lan Gongwu said excitedly: I feel very honored to take office in the celebration of the great victory of the liberation of Jinan. We are the People's Government, and we have the support of the people's strength. In the future, we will better organize the people's representative conferences in counties (cities) and villages, lead the people to fully support the front line, and quickly and thoroughly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek. Vice-Chairman Yang Xiufeng reviewed the bureaucracy and guerrilla style that existed in the original Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and have not yet been completely eliminated. He called on everyone, after the establishment of the North China People's Government, to thoroughly examine the past shortcomings based on the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference's resolution on reviewing the work of the two border region governments. If we didn't do well in the past, we will make up for it well in the future. Next, Commander Nie Rongzhen of the North China Military Region, President Chen Jinkun of the People's Court, Minister of Justice Xie Juezai, and Director Xing Zhaotang of the North China Water Conservancy Commission all delivered speeches in succession. The meeting ended in joy at 9 p.m.

　　华北人民政府正式成立
  　董必武主席率各部会院长就职
    【本报特讯】华北人民政府已于上月二十六日正式成立。根据华北临时人民代表大会的决议，华北人民政府委员会经过二十日至二十四日五天的讨论，慎重地选出华北人民政府正副主席，任命了政府各部会院行厅长等负责干部；处理了人代会移交之决议与大会提案；审议了联合办公的两边区政府（原晋察冀边区行政委员会与晋冀鲁豫边区政府）提请审议之各项条例规程草案。最后正副主席及各部会院行厅长等人员在政府干部庆祝我军解放济南的狂欢中正式就职。
    会议共到政府委员二十二人，超过法定人数。（徐向前、范文澜、成仿吾、张苏、薛迅五委员因公未克出席）六十三岁的老革命家，中共中央政治局委员董必武同志以最多数票当选为政府主席；中共中央委员，人民解放军华北军区政治委员薄一波同志当选第一副主席；无党无派的全国知名的老教育家蓝公武先生当选第二副主席；前晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰当选第三副主席。其他如有名的法律专家老教授陈瑾昆被任命为华北人民法院院长；大学教授黄松龄、于力（董鲁安）为华北监察院副院长；水利专家徐正为华北水利委员会副主任；工业专家刘鼎、徐达本为公营企业部副部长；工人赵国强同志为劳动局副局长；其余各部院的负责人，也都是长期为民族解放民主自由而斗争的各方面的各革命阶层的有能力的干部。
    政府委员会讨论决定
    一切制度章程都要走向正规
    会议深入地讨论了政府组织规程。根据华北已处于相对安定环境的条件下，认为华北人民政府，一切制度和章程，都应从游击状态走向正规化。会上一致批评了过去游击环境中所带来所养成的那种游击习气，许多过去曾经是正确的必须的事情（也有些过去也是错误的），但在今天走向正规建设的情况下，就不适当了；就必须改正。办事一定要有制度，有章程，以增强行政效率，管理四千五百万人口的行政事宜，而仍采取毛手毛脚的遇事没有规矩，只凭良心记忆力批条子临时作主张的办法，不但不可能，而且一定要坏事的。会议一致通过的华北人民政府组织规程，详尽地规定了华北人民政府办事的规程，职务责任权限划分的十分清楚，办事的手续也擘划的有条有理。这些都是为了加强华北正规建设的必要措施。
    为了提高华北人民的生产，响应毛主席“把生产在现有的基础上提高一寸”的号召，大会反复讨论了华北临时人民代表会议所原则通过的，交付政府修改然后公布的“新农业税则”与新起草的“工商业所得税条例”草案。在新农业税则中规定：废除土地改革以前的农业累进税，实行按常年应产量比例征收的税制，由于深耕细作，勤劳而增多产量者不增税；同时不征副业税，以鼓励发展副业生产，这一新的规定，将给土改后的农民生产热情以莫大的鼓励。在工商业所得税条例中规定：工商业税累进征收最高税率以不超过纯利百分之二十五为宜。这是具体体现了我党一贯保护工商业的政策。
    会议也仔细地研究了华北临时人代会决议交付华北人民政府委员会处理的一六三件提案，决议交各主管部门按临时人代会决议的“执行”“斟酌办理”“参考”等三类分别研究，呈经主席核准处理。对联合办公的两边区政府提请审议的二十一种条例草案，政府委员会分组了六个审查委员会进行反复审查修改，再经政府委员会通过，并一一作出决议。这些提案包括政治、军事、经济、文化教育各种提案在内，将更有力地推进华北解放区的建设，更有力地支援全国解放战争的胜利。
    二十六日，董必武主席在华北政府就职干部大会上，更明确地指示出了今后政府工作的任务。他说：现在人民解放战争已引向蒋管区，华北土地改革已基本完成，今后华北人民政府的中心任务，是要大力发展生产，照着毛主席所说的，把生产提高一寸。董主席接着强调指出：华北人民政府是一个正规的政府，它应当有一套正规的制度与办法，有人说这是形式，正规的政府就要讲一定的形式，不讲形式，光讲良心和记忆，会把事情办坏的。我们不要过去那样繁琐的公文手续，但有一点是必要的：就是凡事必须报告，必须克服过去遇事事前不请示，事后不报告的无组织无纪律状态。我们是人民选举出来的，我们要向人民负责，人民要求我们办事要有制度有纪律，无制度无纪律一定办不好事情。蓝公武副主席很兴奋地说：在庆祝济南解放的伟大胜利中就职，我感到很光荣。我们是人民政府，我们有人民力量的支持，今后我们更好地把县（市）村人民代表会组织起来，领导人民全力支援前线，迅速彻底消灭将介石。杨秀峰副主席检讨了原晋冀鲁豫边区政府过去存在着，现在还未完全扫除的官僚主义，游击作风。号召在华北人民政府成立后，大家要根据华北临时人代会对两边区政府工作审查的决议，把过去缺点深入检查一番，过去没作好，今后好好来补救。接着，华北军区聂荣臻司令员，人民法院陈瑾昆院长、司法部长谢觉哉、华北水利委员会主任邢肇棠，都相继发表演说，会议至夜深九时。始尽欢而散。
