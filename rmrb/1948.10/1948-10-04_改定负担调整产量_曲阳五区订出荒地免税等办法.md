　　Revised Burden Adjustment Production
    Quyang Fifth District Formulates Measures Such as Tax Exemption for Wasteland
    [Beiyue News] To make this year's autumn collection fair and reasonable, and to roughly balance production between villages and households, the Fifth District of Quyang convened an enlarged meeting of the entire district on August 18th. A total of 322 people, including farmer representatives, village-level cadres, and primary school teachers, studied specific measures for the district to revise burdens and adjust production. The 51 administrative villages in the district were divided into eight groups, and each group used the draft accounts brought by the villages, including the population, land, and production of the Republic of China years 35 and 36 (1946 and 1947), and after the land reform to conduct two days of discussion. Certain confusions in the past unified progressive tax were exposed, such as corruption, concealment of land, and production. Beizhuang Village concealed 100% in the 35th year and 50% in the 36th year, but the village still collected public grain according to the original score, resulting in the embezzlement of more than 3,000 jin. After the land reform, Lijiazhuang concealed 801 mu of land, and therefore also concealed 840 shi and 7 dou of production. The inspection also revealed that production was very unfair. The North and South Shuiyu villages in the district are only about one li apart, and the geology of the two villages is similar, but the production differs greatly. The paddy fields in North Shuiyu have a yield of 3 shi, 2 dou, 6 sheng, and 7 he per mu, while the paddy fields in South Shuiyu have a yield of only 1 shi, 7 dou, and 2 he per mu, almost half the amount. The interplanted land in Hujiazui and Gouli Village has a yield of 2 shi and 5 dou per mu (paddy field) in Gouli Village, while Hujiazui only has 2 shi and 5 he per mu (paddy field). After this inspection, the cadres who participated in the meeting realized that revising the burden and adjusting production after the land reform is a complex and important task.
    In terms of the methods to be carried out, the conference decided that each village should establish an adjustment committee, select a certain number of personnel, and agree on a unified time to check the draft accounts and production in the fields, and change to a unified production, emphasizing starting from reality. In carrying out this work, the production of general villages and households should remain unchanged, and individual production that is too high or too low can be appropriately changed after discussion by the masses based on the specific situation. The conference finally discussed some specific issues and made decisions. (1) This year, public grain may not be paid for land that has been forced to be deserted due to lack of labor. (2) For military dependents who lack labor, if the substitute cultivation has been fixed to households and the land is deserted, the substitute cultivation households shall be responsible for paying public grain and compensating the military dependents for the losses caused by the deserted land; for the land deserted by military dependents who have not fixed substitute cultivation, the cadres assigned to cultivate substitute shall be responsible for paying public grain and compensating the military dependents for the losses. (The above two methods are not appropriate. The reasons for poor substitute cultivation should be carefully investigated. If it is indeed the substitute cultivation households or the cadres assigned to cultivate substitute who have failed to fulfill their responsibilities, they can be asked to make appropriate compensation and ensure good substitute cultivation in the future. - Editor) (3) New wasteland and newly formed beaches will not bear burdens for three years, and dry land that has been turned into paddy fields will not increase production for three years. (4) For military fields and mobile fields left over from the land reform that are temporarily distributed to farmers for cultivation, whoever cultivates them shall pay public grain. For those that no one had cultivated before, and active farmers rushed to plant after the rain, this year's public grain will be exempted. (5) When the large trees in the fields affect the production of neighboring land, if the landowner of the neighboring land requests a reduction in production, the landowner with the trees should first be persuaded to remove the trees. If they do not agree, the trees should not be forcibly removed, and the production of the neighboring land should be appropriately reduced and added to the tree owner (It is generally not advisable to remove trees. If they greatly affect the production of neighboring land, the tree owner may bear a portion, which should be resolved through consultation between both parties. - Editor). (6) When the quality of the land is the same, because the strength of the labor force of the two families is different, and the crops grow differently, the production of both parties should still be the same, but the weaker labor force should be taken care of in the collection (It is right to take appropriate care of the old, weak, disabled, and sick who lack labor, but lazy people and idlers must never be taken care of. - Editor).

　　改定负担调整产量
    曲阳五区订出荒地免税等办法
    【北岳讯】为使今年秋季征收公平合理，在产量上村与村户与户大体平衡一致。曲阳五区，于八月十八日召开了全区扩大会议，计有农民代表、村级干部、小学教员共三百二十二人，研究该区如何改定负担调整产量的具体办法。全区五十一个行政村共分了八个小组，以组为单位，根据各村带来的民国三十五、三十六年度及土改后的人口、土地、产量等草帐，进行了两天的讨论。检查出过去统累税的某些混乱，如贪污、隐瞒土地、产量等。北庄村三十五年度隐瞒了一百分，三十六年度隐瞒了五十分，但该村仍按原分数征收公粮，结果从中贪污三千余斤。李家庄土改后匿报土地八百零一亩，因此也匿报产量八百四十石零七斗。检查中发现产量亦很不公平，该区南、北水峪，相距不过一里地，两个村的地质相差不多，但产量上就差得很多，北水峪的水地每亩产量三石二斗六升七合，南水峪水地每亩产量只有一石七斗零二合，几乎相差一半。胡家嘴与沟里村的插花地产量，沟里村每亩（水地）二石五斗五升，胡家嘴每亩（水地）才合二石零五合，经过这次的检查，参加会的干部均认识了土改后改定负担，调整产是一个复杂而重要的工作。
    在进行的办法上，大会决定：各村成立调整委员会，抽出一定的人员，约定统一时间到地里查草帐、对产量，改为统一产量，强调从实际出发。在进行此一工作中，一般村户不动，个别的太高或太低的产量，可根据具体情况，经群众讨论后，做适当的更动。大会最后讨论了一些具体的问题并做了决定。（一）对没有劳动力被迫荒了的土地，今年可不缴纳公粮。（二）没有劳力的军属，已将代耕固定到户而荒了土地，由代耕户负责缴纳公粮，并赔偿军属因荒地所受的损失；没有因定代耕的军属所荒的土地，由派代耕的干部负责缴纳公粮并赔偿军属的损失。（以上两个办法均不妥当，应切实考察代耕不好原因，如确系代耕户或派代耕的干部未负起责任，可要他们酌量补偿，并保证以后好好代耕。——编者）（三）新的荒地及新成滩的地，三年之内不出负担，旱地变水地的三年不增产量。（四）土改留下的军田，机动田，暂时分给农民种的，谁种谁纳公粮，以前根本无人种的，雨后积极农民抢种上了，免征今年的公粮。（五）地里的大树，邻地产量受影响时，如邻地地主要求降低产量时，可先说服有树的地主把树刨掉，如不同意时则不强制刨，应将邻地产量适当的降低，给树主加上（一般不宜把树刨掉，如十分影响邻地产量时，可酌量由树主负担一部分，由双方协商解决。——编者）。（六）地的质量相同，因为两家劳动力的强弱不同，庄稼长的好坏不一样时，双方的产量仍要订成一样，但在征收中对劳力弱者应加以照顾（适当照顾缺乏劳力之老弱残废，是应该的，但决不能照顾懒汉二流子。——编者）。
