　　Xingtang Masses Understand Policies
  　Great Enthusiasm for Production and Prosperity
    [North Yue News] In order to stabilize the production mood of the masses, Xingtang used various methods to vigorously publicize the Party's policies, breaking the ideological concerns of some masses who feared being liquidated, and overcoming the phenomenon of eating and drinking extravagantly and not engaging in production. During the district's expanded cadre meeting, the masses in most villages did not understand the policies, and were very uneasy about production. The masses in Yanshangtou Shangbeijia and other areas said: Last year, the cadres held a large meeting and carried out an average distribution of land. We don’t know what will happen this year. As a result, some ate and drank extravagantly, and some sold their livestock. Based on this situation, the Xingtang County Party Committee, during the conference, mobilized cadres to write letters to their families and close comrades, informing them of the spirit of the meeting, which played a significant role. After Yang Lonao of the County Armed Forces Department returned home, his uncle stopped him and asked, "Will there be any more liquidation?" Yang immediately explained the policy of ending land reform and developing production. His uncle said, "That's good, I'll do what I'm supposed to do." After the district conference ended and the cadres returned to the county, they were still afraid that the masses would continue to eat extravagantly. On the one hand, they quickly convened village cadre meetings to convey the policy; on the other hand, they used blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, small group meetings, and market publicity to explain the policy of ending land reform, developing production, confirming land ownership, and issuing land certificates. This greatly stabilized the mood of the masses. Before the publicity, a butcher shop in Nanjie slaughtered eight large pigs, and sold them for 1,600 yuan per jin, which was not enough to meet demand. After the publicity, the price of meat dropped to 1,000 yuan, but they could not sell it. It is said that this butcher shop earned 400,000 yuan less. An old man in Nanquhe Town first cut eighteen jins of meat at the market; after hearing the publicity, he went to the butcher shop and said he didn't need it and wouldn't buy it. After the publicity in Koutou Town, jujubes rose from 1,200 to 2,200, while jujube wine fell from 2,000 to 1,500. Necessities rose in price, while non-essentials fell. Feng, a middle peasant in Jiamu Village, Fourth District, did not understand the policy at first and sold his donkey cheaply; after hearing the publicity, he scraped together money and bought a mule. After understanding the policy, the masses in Duyanggang Village are very confident in exceeding the number of wheat plantings in previous years. They are now urgently requesting the issuance of land certificates.

　　行唐群众懂清政策
  　生产发家劲大
    【北岳讯】行唐为安定群众生产情绪，运用各种方式大力宣传党的政策，打破了部分群众怕清算的思想顾虑，克服了大吃大喝，不事生产的现象。在分区召开扩干会期间，大部村庄群众闹不清政策，生产很不安心。燕头上碑贾木一带群众说：去年干部开大会，闹了个平均土地，今年可不知闹什么哩。于是有的大吃大喝，有的卖掉牲口。行唐县委根据这种情况，在大会期间即发动干部给家中和知己的同志写信，告知他们会议的精神，这样起了不小作用。县武装部杨洛闹回家以后，他叔拉住问他：“还清算不清算。”杨即将结束土改、发展生产的政策讲了一遍。他叔说：“这行咧，该干什么我还干什么去”。分区大会结束干部回县后，还怕群众再滥吃，一面迅速召开村干会传达，一面利用黑板报，屋顶广播，开片会，集市宣传，解释结束土改，发展生产，确定地权，发土地证的政策。这样大大安定了群众情绪。南街一家肉铺，在宣传以前杀了八口大猪，一千六百元一斤还不够卖；宣传后，肉价降到一千元还卖不出去。据说这家肉铺少挣了四十万元。南曲河镇上有一个老汉，一到集上先割了十八斤肉；听到宣传后，找到肉铺说要不起，不买了。口头镇上宣传后，枣子由一千二涨到两千二，枣酒却由二千下降到一千五。必需品上涨，非必需品下降了。四区贾木村中农冯某起初不了解政策，把毛驴贱卖掉；听到宣传，又东凑西凑的买了头骡子。独羊岗村群众了解政策后，很有信心超过往年种麦数。现正迫切要求发土地证。
