　　Beware the New Conspiracy of the Traitors
    Following Chen Lifu's return from the United States, Zhang Qun, another secret envoy of the Kuomintang reactionaries, also returned to Nanjing from Japan. The Kuomintang reactionaries, sick to the core and seeking divine help everywhere, are obviously placing their last hope on the Republican Party in the United States. Among the American reactionaries Chen Lifu visited one by one, Chiang Kai-shek specifically wrote a personal letter to Republican presidential candidate Dewey. Similarly, Zhang Qun, during his visit to Japan, also took Chiang Kai-shek's letter to meet with the Republican warlord MacArthur. Although Chiang Kai-shek is praying that a Republican American government will send troops to directly attack the Chinese people, and even dreaming of a US-Soviet war, he also knows that this request is difficult to achieve. Therefore, he first hopes to realize a preliminary plan, the so-called "Anti-Communist Alliance of China, Japan, and Korea," in order to lead to the next step. Under this plan, one of Zhang Qun's main tasks in visiting Japan was to discuss with MacArthur and his Japanese running dogs the mobilization of a group of Japanese troops to participate in China's civil war. The development of this conspiracy deserves the serious attention of the Chinese people.
    This plan of the Chinese reactionaries seems new, but it is not. The Chinese people have long tasted the so-called "Sino-Japanese Joint Anti-Communism" of the Japanese imperialists. The seventeenth anniversary of the "September 18th Incident" has just passed. Every Chinese person, including every Chinese person with a little national conscience in the Kuomintang army and Kuomintang government organs, should remember this page in Chinese history – the painful history of the Japanese imperialist invasion of China caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries' traitorous policy. For seventeen years, the Kuomintang reactionaries have never abandoned their intention of "using barbarians to control the Chinese" towards Japanese imperialism. From the "September 18th Incident" to the outbreak of the "July 7th" War of Resistance, the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy was indeed like this; even when they were forced to conduct war against Japan, they did not forget to use the War of Resistance to realize their conspiracy to eliminate dissidents. And before long, they further implemented a passive observation, "curve-saving the nation," and colluded with Japanese imperialism to attack the Chinese people's army. After Japan surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Kuomintang reactionaries, first spoke extensively about his "benevolent" "forgiveness" towards the newly defeated Japanese imperialists; then, he retained Japanese troops and Japanese war criminals to participate in the anti-people civil war, and hired Japanese war criminals to participate in "resource development"; thirdly, he listened attentively to and supported the American opposition's policy of supporting the revival of Japanese aggression forces, and even actively promoted the reconstruction of Japan's aggressive industry. The Kuomintang government's traitorous diplomacy of "using barbarians to control the Chinese" has reached its peak with Zhang Qun's conspiracy activities in Japan this time, taking the initiative to ask the Japanese aggressors to "jointly fight communism" with the Kuomintang!
    But the Kuomintang's plan has a fatal flaw. The Kuomintang's seeking help from Dewey came after the failure of the American reactionaries' intimidation about a third world war, and after the American reactionaries had already aided the Kuomintang with 6.6 billion US dollars and had already proven to be a failure. The Kuomintang's seeking help from MacArthur and his Japanese running dogs came after Japanese imperialism had already fought China for eight years and had already proven to be a failure, and after the Kuomintang had already retained a part of Japanese prisoners to conduct the civil war, and had already proven to be a failure. The strength of the Chinese people has become so strong, and the inevitable demise of the Kuomintang rule has become so obvious, that the so-called anti-communist alliance of China, Japan, and Korea, and the expansion of American aid to the Kuomintang, both seem to lack serious realistic significance. Precisely because of this, Chen Lifu and Zhang Qun's despicable missions did not receive the expected "enthusiastic response." Chiang Kai-shek comforted himself and his subordinates, saying that this was because the Democratic Party had "prejudice" against him, and the Republican Party had not yet taken the stage. Nanjing rumors say that Chiang Kai-shek is planning to go to the United States himself this winter to "help" Dewey's campaign and to persuade Dewey and MacArthur to give more "active" assistance. But are Dewey, MacArthur, and the remnants of Japanese imperialism really willing to expand their adventures in an obviously hopeless struggle? The deterioration of the Kuomintang reactionaries' military, political, and economic situation is now not counted by the year, but by the month. It can be completely asserted that the timing chosen by Chiang Kai-shek will be darker than the timing of Chen Lifu and Zhang Qun. No matter what shameless conspiracies Chiang Kai-shek carries out, and no matter what kind of decisions the reactionaries of the United States and Japan make, they cannot save the demise of the Kuomintang rule.

### 注意卖国贼的新阴谋

　　注意卖国贼的新阴谋
    随着陈立夫从美国回来之后，国民党反动派的另一个密使张群也从日本回到南京了。因为病入膏肓而到处求神拜佛的国民党反动派，显然是把最后的愿心许在美国共和党的身上。在陈立夫逐一拜见的美国反动分子中间，蒋介石特意给共和党总统候选人杜威写了亲笔信。同样，访问日本的张群，也拿了蒋介石的信去拜见了共和党的军阀麦克阿瑟。蒋介石虽然祷告着共和党的美国政府能够出兵直接进攻中国人民，甚至梦想着美苏战争，但是他也知道这个要求难于实现，因此首先希望实现一个初步的计划，即所谓“中日韩反共同盟”，以便由此引出下一步的文章。在这个计划之下，张群访问日本的主要任务之一，就是与麦克阿瑟及其日本走狗商量动员一批日本军队参加中国的内战。这个阴谋的发展，值得中国人民的严重注意。
    中国反动派的这种计划，好象是新的，其实并不是新的。中国人民老早就尝过了日本帝国主义者所谓“中日共同防共”的滋味。“九一八”的十七周年刚刚过去，每个中国人，包括国民党军队及国民党政府机关中的每个稍有民族良心的中国人，都应该记得中国历史上这一页由国民党反动派的卖国政策所招致的日本帝国主义侵略中国的惨痛历史。十七年来，国民党反动派对于日本帝国主义，始终没有放弃过“以夷制华”的打算。从“九一八”事变到“七七”抗战爆发，国民党反动派的政策固然是如此；就是在被迫进行对日作战的时候，它也没有忘记利用抗战来实现其消灭异己的阴谋，而且为时不久，它便进一步实行消极观战，曲线救国，协同日本帝国主义进攻中国人民的军队。日本投降了，国民党反动派头子蒋介石始则对刚刚战败的日本帝国主义大讲其“仁爱”的“恕道”；再则留用日军和日本战犯参加反人民的内战，聘请日本战犯参加“开发资源”；三则对于美国反对派扶助日本侵略势力复兴的政策俯首贴耳，加以赞助，甚至积极促进日本侵略性工业的重建。国民党政府这种“以夷制华”的卖国外交，到了张群这次在日本进行阴谋活动，主动地要求日本侵略者来与国民党“共同防共”，可说是登峰造极了！
    但是国民党的计划有一个致命伤。国民党求救于杜威，是在美国反动派关于世界第三次大战的恫吓已经证明失败以后，是在美国反动派已经用六十六亿美元援助了国民党并已经证明失败以后。国民党求救于麦克阿瑟及其日本走狗，是在日本帝国主义已经向中国作战了八年并已经证明失败以后，是在国民党已经留用了一部分日本俘虏进行内战，并已经证明失败以后。中国人民的力量已经如此强大，国民党统治的必然灭亡已经如此明显，以至所谓中日韩反共同盟也好，美国对于国民党的扩大援助也好，都显得缺少郑重的现实的意义。正因如此，陈立夫和张群的卑鄙使命，并没有得到预期的“热烈响应”。蒋介石安慰他自己和他的部下说：这是因为民主党对他有了“成见”，而共和党究竟还没有登台的原故。南京传说，蒋介石正计划在今年冬天自己到美国去“帮助”杜威的竞选，自己去劝说杜威和麦克阿瑟给以更“积极”的援助。但是杜威、麦克阿瑟以及日本帝国主义分子的残余，他们果然愿意在显然无望的斗争中扩大他们的冒险吗？国民党反动派的军事、政治、经济形势的恶化，现在不是以年计，而是以月计。完全可以断定：蒋介石所选择的时机将要比陈立夫、张群的时机更黑暗。无论蒋介石进行怎样无耻的阴谋，也无论美国和日本的反动派作出这一种或那一种决定，他们都不能挽救国民党统治的灭亡。
