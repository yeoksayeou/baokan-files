　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Electric News Agency, London reports: An Electric News Agency reporter who just returned from Malaya reports: After three years of relatively peaceful life, the people of Malaya are now all saying: "This is just like the era of Japanese occupation again." Today's Malaya is filled with arrogant police, cruel Gurkha soldiers (note: referring to Indian Gurkhas hired by the British), and嚣张 arrogant British soldiers. The worst are those thugs - British rubber plantation owners. Today's police are the same police that the British handed over to the Japanese in 1942. After the Japanese surrender, they were handed back to their old masters, bringing with them the particularly cruel interrogation techniques they had learned from the Japanese. They raid homes, extorting small vendors, rickshaw pullers, and truck drivers on any pretext. Some police officers protect illegal activities such as brothels and casinos. Police stations even cooperate with criminal groups, and detectives talk loudly in cafes about how they torture "communists." The people hate the police as much as they hate poison. The government is recruiting an army composed of hooligans and launching a campaign of terror against the people.

　　马来亚又像日军占领时代
  　英国军警残忍嚣张
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】电通社伦敦讯：刚由马来亚归来的电通社记者报导：马来亚人民在过了三年比较平静的生活后，现在人人都在说：“这又象日军占领时代了。”今日的马来亚充满着傲慢的警察，残忍的廓尔喀兵士（按系英国雇佣之印度廓尔喀族人），嚣张的英国兵士。最坏的是那些暴汉——英国橡园主。今日的警察即是一九四二年时英人移交给日军的警察，日本投降后，带着从日本人那里学来的特别残忍的刑讯技术，他们又被日军移交给他们的旧主人了。他们突袭住宅，借故敲榨小贩、人力车夫及卡车司机等人。若干警官对妓院与赌场等非法活动，予以保护。警察局甚至与犯罪团体合作，侦探们在咖啡馆高谈他们如何刑讯“共产党人”。人民痛恨警察有如痛恨毒物。政府招募一批流氓所组成的军队，正在对人民发动恐怖攻势。
