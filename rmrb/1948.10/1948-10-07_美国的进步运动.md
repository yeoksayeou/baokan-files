　　The Progressive Movement in the United States
    Ｐ·奥泽洛夫

    In a Broadway movie theater, a newsreel with a few shots depicting events that were supposed to be hopeful was playing. The audience saw American-made rifles firing; guerrillas armed with Thompson submachine guns firing back; and anxious Greek soldiers struggling up rocky hills. Corpses were being moved, and a group of captured, wounded guerrillas were being led to prison camps.

    The loudspeaker blared in a flat, urgent tone: "Among these injured people, there is an eighteen-year-old girl. What made her leave her family and take up arms?"

    An extreme close-up of this brave girl flashed on the screen. The audience's reaction was something the American manufacturers of Greek tragedy had hardly anticipated—a burst of applause erupted throughout the theater.

    The loudspeaker continued: "To ensure the safety of the cities, the Greek security authorities are isolating all suspicious elements." This was followed by a shot showing a group of young people and workers with resolute expressions and full beards—hostages in the hands of the Greek secret police, trained and supervised by American instructors. These hostages were being led away, their faces expressing anger. More enthusiastic applause erupted from even more of the audience. But the applause suddenly died down: a column of Greek troops wearing steel helmets and equipped with "Garand" rifles appeared on the screen.

    Idaho Senator Taylor, the independent candidate for U.S. Vice President, recently concluded a trip during which he gave speeches across the country condemning the Marshall Plan and the current U.S. government. In Boise, the capital of Idaho, his lecture was only announced the day before it was held. Nevertheless, the audience crowded into the El Korah Shrine Auditorium—the largest hall in the city. At the end of his speech, Taylor asked those who supported his continued pursuit of his current policies to stand up. Almost the entire audience rose from their seats. Even more meaningful than this silent vote of confidence was the audience's actions after the meeting. Taylor said: For a full hour, people approached him and shook his hand, wishing him success.

    I have written the above anecdotes because they reflect the current development in the United States. The Hearst newspapers are making hysterical roars for more billions of dollars in military spending and the planned universal conscription. "The New York Journal-American" demands a "strong man" to lead the United States, and Hearst is pushing MacArthur for president.

    The North American Newspaper Alliance is in a lawsuit with Doubleday & Company, vying for the glory of being the first to publish Goebbels' diaries. Another publishing company, "Ziff-Davis," recently announced that it had obtained and intended to publish the biography of the hanged Nazi war criminal Rosenberg.

    In early March, hundreds of Ku Klux Klan members in hoods, masks, and white robes staged a parade in the predominantly Black town of Lyons, Georgia. They first listened to a speech by a certain Dr. Green boosting the morale of the mob, then set fire to a giant cross and declared: If any Black person is allowed to participate in the upcoming local elections, "blood will flow backward in the thoroughfares of the American South." This threat worked.

    What is the people's reaction to the activities of the reactionary forces and the war psychosis being incited by the militarist bloc?

    "Wallace's Farmer"—the trusted magazine founded by the grandfather of current presidential candidate Wallace—recently asked its readers: What worries them most? Sixty-four percent replied: the deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations.

    At a recent meeting of the Security Council discussing the Palestine issue, when U.S. representative Austin called for "forceful measures," a tall woman in mourning dress stood up from the gallery and shouted: "What measures? I won't let you steal my last son."

    The men and women of America, whom American newspapers are trying to drive mad with fantasies of threats and dangers, are beginning to pay attention to Wallace's speeches. A broad progressive movement has arisen around Wallace's campaign in the November presidential election. This is a movement by honest American people who need peace, work, and freedom from the fear of war. They are shocked and deeply disgusted by the policies being pursued by the insidious alliance of Wall Street and the militarist bloc.

    Wallace's party has become a political force that has a serious impact on the lives of Americans and the policies of the Democratic and Republican parties. It has its platform, which has been elucidated by Wallace in his speeches. It has active followers and has its mass base in the "Progressive Citizens of America" and the progressive parties in New Jersey, New York, Illinois, California, and Pennsylvania.

    In the past year, the "Progressive Citizens of America" has grown from a relatively small group of intellectuals and trade union activists into a mass organization with 100,000 members in twenty-six states. In five other states, its organizations are being established. "Progressive Citizens of America Youth" has chapters in more than one hundred universities and colleges. The Arts, Sciences, and Professions Council unites thousands of progressive intellectuals.

    C. B. Baldwin, the vice-chairman of the national committee of the "Progressive Citizens of America," explained at the organization's second convention that the organization's growth was because it championed the interests of the people. He said: The "Progressive Citizens of America" stands at the forefront of the struggle for civil liberties and against racial discrimination. It fights to maintain control over prices and rents. It demands measures to fight inflation and the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, and its national committee has convened a conference to defend academic freedom.

    I attended the second convention of the "Progressive Citizens of America" held in Chicago in the second half of January.

    When convention chairman Kenny announced that Wallace would address the convention, a burst of cheers erupted. Wallace walked through the flag-draped door near the podium into the hall, and hundreds of delegates and guests stood up. Wallace smiled, walked to the podium, greeted the people on the stage, and then went to the microphone.

    The cheers rose even higher, and the delegates sitting in the center of the hall left their seats. Banners were held high above the crowd, reading: "We Need Wallace," "Wallace to the White House," "Support Wallace, Down with War." The delegates walked in the aisles of the hall to pay their respects to Wallace, men and women from all walks of life. I recognized a famous professor from Harvard University, a Black social worker from St. Louis, a film producer from Hollywood, a publisher from Pennsylvania... Groups joined the parade that filled the aisles. The cheers and applause lasted a full ten minutes.

    Wallace's speech mainly concerned domestic issues. He said: "Today's inflation began in 1940, when big business, through its political agents, demanded excessive profits and demanded major concessions from the government in taxes and tighter control over the vital sectors of the national economy, as the price for participating in the defense of America... Today's profits are so huge that even after greatly increasing wages and lowering prices, companies' profits, whether before or after taxes, remain far higher than before the war." Wallace went on to say that the main task was to abolish the Taft-Hartley Act. He said: During his travels across the country, he saw American workers in a state of constant tension twenty-four hours a day. At home, they cannot keep up with the rising cost of living; in the factories, they cannot keep up with the speed-up system that drains their entire energy. Wallace told the audience that "the government's war policy, represented by the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, called the European Recovery Program, requires a tightly regulated economy controlled by big business for its own benefit. "This war policy will inevitably lead to higher and higher prices and profits." The struggle against the war plan is a struggle to raise the living standards of the American people. Wallace pointed out that many things must be done to overcome the consequences of current policies. He called on people to organize and take action, to fight for peace and prosperity. The convention unanimously nominated Wallace as the presidential candidate and stipulated that in the states where "Progressive Citizens of America" organizations exist, they should vigorously conduct registration of presidential candidates.

    The Chicago convention closed in typical American style. Black singer Robeson stood movingly in front of the microphone, singing Wallace in a majestic voice. I can't remember the lyrics, but I remember the words that the whole hall sang along with him: "Wallace and we are of one heart and one mind." Amid the loud singing, a little girl walked in the aisle carrying a long white flag. Ten-dollar, five-dollar, and one-dollar bills, coins, and checks were thrown onto the long flag, raising several thousand dollars in more than ten minutes, which was no small donation for the "Progressive Citizens of America." Last year, the "Progressive Citizens of America" raised a total of $400,000, about one-tenth of the National Association of Manufacturers' propaganda expenses.

    Chicago is one of the largest industrial areas in the United States and the center of the American grain trade. It was Chicago's wheat trading that, in early February, caused the first major shock that shook the entire United States, foreshadowing the approach of a new economic crisis.

    Gangsters are still active in Chicago, although they don't show their faces much. It is clear that the root of Chicago's crime should be found in the miserable living conditions of the majority of the working people, especially Black people. Last fall, Chicago's progressive forces openly challenged the alliance of the Democratic and Republican parties. For many years, the election of the twenty-one judges of Cook County (including Chicago and its vicinity) has been based on a so-called "joint slate" system. Under this system, the local heads of the Democratic and Republican parties secretly agree on the quotas allocated to each party, and then jointly nominate a single candidate for each of the twenty-one judgeships. Some progressive leaders decided to challenge this tradition and put forward their own candidates in the election. Prominent trade union leaders and Black social leaders informally supported this plan. Illinois' (Chicago is in this state - translator) election procedures are arranged in such a way as to make it difficult for independent candidates to break in. Registration for independent candidates involves many complicated procedures. Initially, a petition signed by at least 103,000 citizens must be submitted. But the progressive group had to face additional obstacles. It was stipulated that the signature collection must be completed within four weeks. Two weeks later, this deadline was reduced by another week. Despite all these conspiracies, the signatures of 130,000 citizens were finally completed within the stipulated period. Then, the campaign led by the local "Progressive Citizens of America" was launched. Although the old politicians who were at the beck and call of the two parties implemented various conspiracies, the progressive side still obtained 18 percent of the total vote. This was a big victory in Chicago. Professor H. Carey, who ranked first in the progressive vote, received 313,000 votes; Dixon, a Black lawyer who Roosevelt had appointed to lead the Fair Employment Practices Committee, received 207,000 votes. People in Chicago later believed that Professor Carey had in fact won the election, but the votes were fraudulently miscounted, that is, the votes were secretly changed.

    In January 1948, Chicago progressives formed the Illinois Progressive Party and announced their support for Wallace in the upcoming presidential election.

    Even more revealing was the process of the special congressional election held in New York. New York State has forty-seven of the nation's 531 presidential electoral votes, so it plays an important role in the presidential campaign. For this reason, when a special congressional election was held in the Bronx (a borough of New York City with a population of about 1.2 million - translator), the borough's Democratic Party leadership decided to use it as a "pre-test of the presidential campaign."

    The Democratic Party bosses had no doubt that their candidate, K. Popper, would win in the district. The Democratic Party organization in the Bronx was personally led by Flynn himself, one of the most powerful members of the Democratic National Committee and former chairman of the committee. It is well known that at the 1944 Democratic National Convention, Flynn exerted great pressure on Roosevelt, forcing him to choose Truman as his running mate instead of Wallace. Flynn had announced that he had dispatched six hundred election organizers to the 24th congressional district to guarantee the Democratic Party's election. A day or two before the election, Flynn mobilized another 250 campaign workers for the same purpose. In fact, he was so confident of his victory that he had prepared a victory statement in advance, ready to be widely disseminated as soon as the election was over. But the outcome was not like this. Popper was opposed by progressive candidate Isaacson, a former state legislator who pursued a clear Wallace platform: immediate repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, cancellation of the Truman Doctrine, rejection of the Universal Military Training Act, rejection of the Marshall Plan submitted to Congress, full support for the United Nations - striving for progress at home and peace in the world. Isaacson received 22,697 votes, Popper (the Democratic candidate) received 12,578 votes, and Niglis (the Republican candidate) received 1,482 votes. The results of the election made a deep impression both in New York and abroad. For three consecutive days, newspapers published editorials on this topic. The vote clearly supported not only Isaacson, but also opposed Truman-Marshall's domestic and foreign policies, which was the crucial point.

    California is one of the centers of the progressive movement in the United States. The state's independent Progressive Party, in cooperation with the "Progressive Citizens of America," completed the registration of Wallace's candidacy with 464,000 signatures, although only 276,000 signatures were required to qualify. The third-party movement in California is supported by thousands of workers and trade union activists.

    Wallace presidential campaign committees have been established in forty-four of the nation's forty-eight states. In New Jersey, it was recently announced that the registration of independent candidates has been completed. This is led by the "Committee to Elect Wallace and Taylor as President and Vice President, and Eblee as Senator" (Eblee was formerly a banker and later the administrator of the United Auto Workers' strike fund). In 1944, Eblee formed the New Jersey Independent Citizens League, which played a significant role in securing non-party votes for Roosevelt.

    The newspapers of the monopoly capitalists have manufactured many rumors to create confusion among progressives, to insult Wallace and Taylor, and to slander the forces organizing resistance against the reactionary forces. The newspapers have tried to portray Wallace as a "red" and to claim that he harbors communist ideas, which Wallace has repeatedly stated that he does not believe in. It is well known that Wallace supports the existing capitalist system. But he stands up for a peaceful foreign policy and opposes the unlimited power of the monopoly capitalists. He represents the interests of 2.7 million small business owners, of whom, according to statistics, four-fifths have been squeezed out after competing with monopoly groups for five years or less. They are destroyed, giving way to new candidates for bankruptcy.

    The reactionaries have taken every step to prevent trade unions from supporting progressive candidates in the election campaign. The leadership of the Production Federation, which has swung sharply to the right, has instructed all its members not to support Wallace under any circumstances. Yet it is precisely in the trade unions that Wallace receives very strong support. American progressives, who dare to challenge the monopoly groups' privilege of determining presidential candidates from among themselves, will inevitably face a very arduous struggle. In the United States, election campaigns are enormously expensive. It is said that Dewey spent $80 million in 1944 in an attempt to defeat Roosevelt. Wallace's campaign fund is gathered from small donations.

    The old tycoons who support the current reactionary alliance of the two parties will undoubtedly do everything in their power to try to install one of their own in the White House. But regardless of the outcome of the election, the progressive movement that has developed forward in the election campaign will inevitably leave a profound impact on American political life.

　　美国的进步运动
    Ｐ·奥泽洛夫
    在百老汇一所电影院里放映的新闻片，插有几个镜头描写着希望进行着的事件。观众看到美制步枪在开火；配备着汤姆枪的游击队员在还击；提心吊胆的希腊士兵，在困顿不堪地沿着多石的山坡向上爬行。尸首正在迁移，一群被俘的游击队伤员被引到囚营。
    扩音机里平板而急促地叫道：“在这些受伤的人里，有一位十八岁的姑娘，什么使得她离开了家庭拿起了武器呢？”
    这位英勇的姑娘的放大镜头，闪现在银幕上。观众的反应，是希腊悲剧的美国制造人所殆未料想到的——全场爆发了一片喝采。
    扩音器里继续叫道：“希腊治安当局，为了使得城市安全，正在隔离一切可疑分子。”紧接着这句话便出现了一个镜头，映出一群年青人和态度昂然不屈满面胡髭的工人——他们是美国教官所训练、监督的希腊秘密警察手中的人质。这些人质被拉走了，他们的脸上表现着愤怒。全场从更多观众中爆发了更热烈的鼓掌。但鼓掌声突然寂灭：银幕上出现了一队戴着钢盔配备着“加拉德”式枪的希腊军队。
    美国副总统独立竞选人爱达荷州参议员泰勒，最近结束了一次旅行；他在旅行期间在各地发表演说谴责马歇尔计划和当前的美国政府。在爱达荷州的首府波伊西，他的讲演会仅在举行前的一天才宣布。然而听众拥挤了及利斯特大厅——全城最大的大厅。泰勒在结束演讲时要求赞成他们认为他应继续其目前政策的人起立。几乎全体听众都从座位上站了起来。比这无言的信任投票更有意义的，是听众在会后的行动。泰勒说：整整经过一点钟，人们走向他和他握手，祝他成功。
    我写了上面的插话，因为它们反应出美国当前的发展。赫斯特系各报为着更多亿元的军备费和筹划中的普遍军训，正在作歇斯的里的咆哮。“纽约日报和美国人”要求一个“强有力的人”领导美国，赫斯特正在推麦克阿瑟当总统。
    北美报业联盟正与达伯雷出版公司打官司，互争首先出版戈培尔日记的光荣。另一个出版公司“西夫——戴维斯”，最近宣布已得到并打算出版被绞死的纳粹战犯罗森堡的传记。
    三月初，数百围头巾、戴假面、身穿白袍的Ｋ三党党徒，在乔治亚州黑人众多的莱兹维尔城演出一次游行。他们先听了一个什么格林博士给暴徒打气的演讲，然后就举火焚烧一个巨大的十字架，并宣布：假如容许任何一个黑人参加行将到临的地方选举，“鲜血便会逆流在美国南部的通衢大道上”。这个威胁生了效。
    对于反动势力的活动和正被军国主义集团煽起的战争精神病，人民究竟作什么反应呢？
    “华莱士农民”——这是当前总统候选人华莱士的祖父所创办的盛孚众望的杂志，不久前曾询问它的读者：什么最使他们焦虑？百分之六十四的答复是：美苏关系的恶化。
    在安理会最近讨论巴勒斯坦问题的一次集会上，当美国代表奥斯汀要求采取“强力措施”时，一位穿着丧服的高身材的妇女从大厅的旁听席上站起来叫道：“什么措施？我不让你抢去我最后的一个儿子。”
    美国报纸所力图借幻想的威胁与危险的恐吓使其失去理智的男女人民，正开始注视华莱士的演讲。围绕着华莱士在十一月总统选举中的竞选，已兴起了一个广泛的进步运动。这是一个需要和平、工作与免于战争恐惧的自由的诚实的美国人民所进行的运动。华尔街和军国主义集团的阴险联盟所正执行的政策，使他们吃惊并深虑厌恶。
    华莱士的党已经成为对于美国人的生活及民主、共和两党的政策发生严重影响的政治力量。它有其经华莱士在历次讲演中所阐明的政纲。它有积极的追随者，并在“美国进步公民”和新泽西、纽约、伊利诺斯、加利福尼亚、宾夕法尼亚各州的进步党派中有其群众基础。
    在过去一年间，“美国进步公民”已由一个知识分子及工会积极分子的比较狭小的集团发展成为一个在二十六州中拥有十万会员的群众组织。在另外五个州中，它的组织正在建立。“美国青年进步公民”在一百所以上的大学和学院中有着支部。艺术、科学、职业界委员会团结着数千思想进步的知识分子。
    “美国进步公民”全国委员会的副主席Ｃ·Ｂ·鲍尔温，当在该组织的第二届大会上演讲时，曾解释组织的发展是因为它拥护人民的利益。他说：“美国进步公民”站在争取公民自由反对种族歧视的斗争的前列。它为保持对物价及租金的控制而斗争。它要求与通货膨胀作斗争的措施及塔夫脱——哈特莱法案的废止，而且它的全国委员会曾召集过一个保卫学术自由的会议。
    我曾参加正月下半月在芝加哥举行的“美国进步公民”第二届大会。
    当大会主席肯尼宣布华莱士将向大会演说时，轰起了一片欢呼声。华莱士穿过靠近讲台的、缀着旗帜的门走向大厅，数百代表和来宾纷纷起立。华莱士微笑着步上讲台，问候了台上的人们，然后走到扩音器前面。
    欢呼的声浪更高了，坐在大厅中央的代表们离开了座位。标语高悬在人群的头上，上面写着：“我们需要华莱士”，“华莱士到白宫去”，“拥护华莱士，打倒战争”。代表们穿行在大厅内的通道上向华莱士致敬，都是来自各界的男女，我认出一位哈佛大学的名教授，一位圣路易的黑人社会工作者，一位好莱坞的制片商，一位宾夕法尼亚的出版商……。人们一群接着一群地加入挤满通道的游行行列。欢呼声拍掌声整整经历了十分钟。
    华莱士的演讲主要是谈国内问题。他说：“今天的通货膨胀是开端于一九四○年，当时大企业通过其政治代理人要求过份的利润，并要求政府在税收上的重大让步及由它们对国家经济要害作更紧密的控制，他们以这些作为参与保卫美国的代价……。今天的利润是如此庞大，以至于大大地增加工资并减低物价后仍可使公司的利润无论在缴税前或缴税后都保持远较战前为高的水平。”华莱士继称：主要的任务是废除塔夫脱——哈特莱法案。他说：在他旅行全国时，他看到美国工人在全天二十四小时中无时不处于紧张状态。在家里，他们赶不上不断上升的生活费用；在工厂，他们赶不上吸尽其全部精神力的加速制度。华莱士告诉听众说：“杜鲁门主义及名为欧洲复兴计划的马歇尔计划所代表的政府战争政策，要求一个由大企业按其本身利益来控制的、严密调节的经济。他说：“这个战争政策必将不可免地导向愈来愈高的物价和利润。”反对战争计划的斗争，是一个提高美国人民生活水准的斗争。华莱士指出：为着战胜当前政策的后果，必须作许多事情。他号召人们组织起来从事行动，为和平繁荣而战斗。大会一致通过华莱士为总统候选人，并规定在有“美国进步公民”组织的各州，奋力进行总统候选人的登记。
    芝加哥的大会在典型的美国风格中闭幕。黑人歌王罗伯逊动人地站在扩音器前，以雄壮的歌喉歌唱华莱士。我不能记忆歌词，但记得全厅随他合唱的词句：“华莱士和我们心心相印。”在歌声嘹亮中，小姑娘拉着白色的长旗在通道上前行。十元、五元和一元的钱票、硬币和支票，都纷纷投向长旗，在十多分钟里募集了几千块钱，这对于“美国进步公民”是笔不小的捐款。去年“美国进步公民”所募得的款项共为四十万元，约相当于全国制造商协会的宣传经费的十分之一。
    芝加哥是美国最大工业地区之一，并是美国谷物贸易的中心。就是芝加哥的小麦交易，在二月初造成了预告新经济危机业已接近的第一次使全美为之摇撼的大震动。
    双枪党党徒仍然活跃在芝加哥，虽然他们不大抛头露面。显然无疑的是：芝加哥犯罪案件的根源，应从大多数劳动人民尤其黑人的悲惨生活条件中去寻找。去年秋天，芝加哥的进步力量向民主、共和两党的联盟公开挑战。许多年来，科克郡（包括芝加哥及其附近）二十一位法官的选举，都是根据一个所谓“联合名单”的制度。在这制度下，当地的民主、共和两党的头子们私下议定分配给各党的名额，然后向二十一个法官职位中的每一个职位共同指定唯一的一个候选人。一些进步领袖决定向这个传统挑战，并在选举中提出他们自己的候选人。卓越的工会领袖、黑人的社会领袖非正式地支持着这计划。伊利诺斯州（按芝加哥即在此州——译者）的选举程序是经过如此的安排，以使独立候选人难于插入。独立候选人的登记，牵涉许多复杂的手续。开始必须提出至少有十万三千公民签署的请求书。但进步集团不得不面对额外的阻碍。规定了必须在四星期内完成签名。两周后，这期限又减少了一周。尽管有这一切阴谋，在限定的期间内终于完成了十三万公民的签名。接着便展开了当地“美国进步公民”所领导的竞选运动。虽然两党的供人驱使的老政客们实行各种阴谋，但进步方面所获的票数仍达到总票数的百分之十八。这在芝加哥是很大的胜利。在进步票中占第一位的Ｈ·卡莱教授，共得三十一万三千票；罗斯福曾任命领导过合理就业委员会的黑人律师狄克逊，得到二十万七千票。芝加哥的人们后来都认为：卡莱教授本已在事实上赢得了选举，但选票被狡诈地数错数目，也就是说选票在暗中改了样子。
    一九四八年一月，芝加哥进步人士组成了伊利诺斯进步党，并宣布在行将到来的总统选举中拥护华莱士。
    更富启示性的，是纽约举行国会特别选举的经过。纽约州在全国五百三十一张总统选票中占有四十七张，因此在总统竞选运动中占重要地位。由于这个原因，当在布朗克斯区（这是纽约市的一个区，人口约一百二十万——译者）举行国会特别选举时，该区的民主党领导机关便决定把它作为“总统竞选的预试”。
    民主党的头子们毫无怀疑地认为：他们的候选人Ｋ·鲍泼尔必将在该区获胜。布朗克斯区的民主党组织是由傅林本人亲自领导的，傅林是民主党全国委员会中最有势力的人员之一，并曾任该委员会的主席。大家都知道：在一九四四年的民主党全国大会上，傅林曾对罗斯福施用很大的压力，逼迫他选择杜鲁门为副手而不选华莱士。傅林曾宣布派遣了六百名组织选举的组长往第二十四国会选区保证民主党的选举。选举前的一两天内，傅林又为着同样的目的动员了二百五十名进行竞选的人员。事实上，他如此坚信自己的胜利，以致他事先便备妥了胜利宣言，准备一经选举竣事便立即广泛传播。但是事情的结果并非如此。鲍泼尔遭到进步候选人前州议员伊萨克逊的对抗；伊萨克逊奉行着明确的华莱士纲领：立即废止塔夫脱——哈特莱法案，取消杜鲁门主义，否决普遍军训法案，否决提交给国会的那种马歇尔计划，全力支持联合国——在国内争取进步，在全世界争取和平。伊萨克逊得到二万二千六百九十七票，鲍泼尔（民主党候选人）得到一万二千五百七十八票，尼格利斯（共和党候选人）得到一千四百八十二票。选举的结果无论在纽约或在外地都造成了极深的印象。连续三日内，各报纷纷以此为题发表社论。这次的投票显然不仅拥护了伊萨克逊，而且反对了杜鲁门——马歇尔的国内外政策，而后者正是重要之点。
    加利福尼亚州是美国进步运动的中心之一。该州的独立进步党在“美国进步公民”合作下，以四十六万四千份签名完成了华莱士候选资格的登记，虽然只要有二十七万六千份签名便已可符合条件。加利福尼亚的第三党运动受到成千成万的工人和工会积极分子的支持。
    在全国四十八州中，已有四十四个州建立起华莱士竞选总统委员会。在新泽西州，最近宣布已完成了独立候选人的登记。这是由“选举华莱士、泰勒为总统、副总统、依布利为参议员委员会”领导的（依布利以前是个银行家，后来是联合汽车工人罢工基金的管理人）。在一九四四年，依布利组成了新泽西独立公民联盟，这个组织为罗斯福争取非党选票时，曾起了不少的作用。
    垄断资本家的报纸制造了许多谣言企图在进步分子中制造混乱，侮蔑华莱士和泰勒，并中伤反对反动势力组织抵抗的力量。报纸力图把华莱士写成一个“赤党”，并强称他怀抱着共产主义的思想，而这种思想正是华莱士历次宣称不是他所信仰的。大家都知道：华莱士拥护现存的资本主义制度。但他挺身而起争取和平的外交政策，反对垄断资本家的无限权力。他代表着二百七十万小企业家的利益；根据统计数字，这些小企业家在与垄断集团作了五年或不足五年的竞争以后，已有五分之四被挤垮。他们毁灭了，让位给新的破产命运的候选人。
    反动派已采取一切步骤阻止职工会在竞选运动中拥护进步候选人。已剧烈向右的生产联领导机关，已训令其一切会员在任何条件下，不准支持华莱士。然而恰恰在职工会里，华莱士受到十分有力的支持。敢于向垄断集团从自己人里确定总统候选人特权挑战的美国进步人士，将不可免地面对十分艰苦的斗争。在美国，竞选运动耗款浩繁。据说：杜威在一九四四年企图击败罗斯福时，曾花费了八千万美元。华莱士的竞选基金是由微小的捐款聚集起来的。
    支持当前两党反动联盟的老财们，无疑将尽其力之所及，力求把一个自己人安插到白宫里去。但不论选举结果如何，在竞选中向前开展的进步运动必将给美国的政治生活留下深远的影响。（陈致生译自一九四八年四月十四日苏联新时代杂志）
