Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 17th: To coordinate with the Libei Campaign, a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army launched an offensive into the enemy's heartland west of the Luo River and east of the Jing River, capturing multiple strongholds. (1) On the 9th, Luqiao Town, about ten miles north of Sanyuan, was captured, and a portion of the enemy's local armed forces were captured. (2) On the 12th, Fangli Town between Chunhua and Yaoxian was captured. (3) On the 15th, Jincheng on the Dali-Pucheng highway was captured, annihilating the enemy's 90th Division mountain artillery platoon and an entire platoon of the 3rd Engineer Regiment; and routing a battalion of the enemy's manpower transport regiment stationed there, capturing 47 officers and soldiers of the battalion. In addition, more than 2,000 enemy troops coming to reinforce from Pingxin Town, west of the Luo River, including the Engineer Battalion, Special Service Battalion, and Supply Battalion of the reorganized 17th Division, as well as remnants of its 34th Regiment, were routed. (4) On the 16th, Meiyuan Town between Pucheng and Fuping was captured, and most of the enemy's security police force was annihilated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th: Draft conscription, grain requisition, exorbitant taxes, and miscellaneous levies have created an atmosphere of darkness and terror in the shrinking Kuomintang-controlled areas of Shaanxi. To replenish the troop numbers depleted by repeated defeats on the Northwest battlefield, the bandit chieftain Hu Zongnan of Shaanxi recently increased the original conscription quota of 69,000 for this year by an additional 20,000. Regarding local forces, since the establishment of the enemy's 18th and 19th "Pacification Zones" (administering the Xianyang and Weinan areas) in June, it was decided to "expand and reorganize security forces in stages." In addition to the existing security regiments, it is planned to expand by five more security brigades (14 security regiments), and three security battalions will be established in each of the 34 counties of the Guanzhong area, estimated to be no less than 40,000 to 50,000 people. The conscription methods are extremely brutal, with quotas assigned based on land and Baojia regardless of whether there are eligible men. Quotas are assigned in the morning and must be fulfilled by the afternoon. Draft conscription personnel knock on doors and windows in the middle of the night and scale walls. Young men hide everywhere, creating a terrifying atmosphere in the countryside. If soldiers cannot be captured, extortion is used. The price of conscripts has soared. The price of a long-term conscript (handed over to the enemy's regular army) has risen from 12 shi of wheat (old dou, each dou being 25 jin by the old scale, same below) to 18 shi. Recently, in the Fuping area, it has even risen to more than 20 or even 30 shi. In cotton-producing areas, 800 jin of cotton are required per person. The monthly hiring price for a short-term conscript (to the enemy's local forces) has generally increased from 8 dou of wheat to 1.5 shi, and in some areas even to 5 shi.

Regarding grain levies: This year's grain levy has increased sharply from 2.8 million shi last year to more than 5.2 million shi (including actual collection, requisition, provincial and county public grain, and "pacification" public grain). In the Guanzhong counties, the burden of land tax alone this year accounts for 14% to 25% of the yield per mu. However, the Kuomintang government's extortion and exploitation do not stop there, as they must also continue to collect the 1,960,810 market shi owed from last year. They also need to "purchase" 400,000 large bales of military grain (approximately 200 market jin per bale) and "procure" 200,000 large bales of military grain. Coupled with the enemy personnel's embezzlement and the local Baojia's petty exactions, as well as consumption during transportation, the actual burden per mu for farmers is at least twice as much as last year. The urging of levies is as urgent as a burning fire. According to reports in the Xi'an newspapers, the Kuomintang grain levy supervisors of the 34 counties in Guanzhong had already been dispatched to various counties in early July, and the "supervision and propaganda teams" had "set off to various villages and Baojia, checking households one by one and ordering them to pay up on the same day." In addition, there are many random apportionments of grain and money based on land and Baojia, such as "self-defense special donations," rich household donations, telephone fees, bedding fees, tool fees, Bao Public Office wheat, Township Public Office wheat… The slips given by the township public office to the Bao chiefs still list a large pile of items, while the slips given by the Bao chiefs to the Jia chiefs simply state: "Deadline: send ××× yuan by × day." Under this barbaric plunder by the Jiang-Hu bandit gang, the vast majority or even all of the land income of ordinary farmers has been robbed, leading to annual indebtedness and unbearable suffering. They all look forward to the People's Liberation Army liberating them soon.

    【新华社陕中前线十七日电】西北解放军一部配合荔北战役，向洛水以西、泾水以东敌之腹心地区出击，攻克据点多处。（一）九日攻克三原北约十里之鲁桥镇，俘敌地方武装一部。（二）十二日攻克淳化至耀县间之方里镇。（三）十五日攻克大荔至蒲城公路上之晋城，歼敌九十师山炮排及工兵第三团一个排全部；并击溃驻该地之敌人力输送团一个营，俘该营官兵四十七人。另将洛河以西凭信镇来援之敌整十七师工兵营、特务营、辎重营及其三十四团残部共二千余人击溃。（四）十六日攻克蒲城至富平间之美原镇，将守敌保警队大部歼灭。
    【新华社西北十八日电】抓丁、征粮、苛捐、杂税，在日益缩小的陕西国民党统治区内造成了一片黑暗和恐怖现象。陕西匪酋胡宗南为补充其在西北战场因一再惨败而奇缺的兵额，最近又将其原规定今年六万九千名征兵额，加征两万名。其地方团队方面，自六月敌十八、十九两“绥靖区”（辖咸阳、渭南地区）成立后，又决定“分期扩编保安团队”，除原有保安团外，拟再扩编五个保安旅（十四个保安团），并在大关中三十四县各成立三个保安大队，估计不下四、五万人。其征集办法至为蛮横，不管有丁无丁，一律按地亩按保甲摊派。上午来派，下午即要交清，抓丁人员半夜三更打门叫窗，上房跳墙，青壮年到处躲藏，造成农村恐怖现象。抓不到兵就勒索，壮丁价格猛涨，长期壮丁（交给敌正规军）每名由麦子十二石（老斗，每斗老秤二十五斤，下同）涨到十八石，最近富平一带竟有涨至二十多石甚至三十石的。产棉区每名需棉花八百斤。短期壮丁（到敌地方团队）每名每月雇价由八斗麦子，普遍涨至一石五，个别地区甚至有涨到五石的。
    赋粮方面：今年赋粮由去年的二百八十万石，遽增到五百二十余万石（包括征实、征借、省县公粮、“绥靖”公粮）。关中各县，今年单田赋一项负担即占去每亩收获量的百分之十四到百分之二十五。但国民党政府的勒索榨取的还远不止此数，因为还要续征去年的一百九十六万八千零十市石。还要“收购”军粮四十万大包（每大包约二百市斤），“采购”军粮二十万大包，加上敌方人员的贪污中饱、地方保甲的零星摊派、拨运途中的消费，农民每亩的实际负担，较去年至少增加一倍以上。催征急如星火，据西安报载：关中三十四县国民党粮赋督征人员，已于七月初分赴各县，“督征宣传队”又“分途出发各乡各保，挨户查串，勒令当日交清”。另外随时按地亩按保甲的粮款摊派，又极繁多，有什么“自卫特捐”、富户捐、电话费、被褥费、工具费、保公所麦、乡公所麦………。乡公所给保长的条子还开上一大堆名目，保长给甲长的条子就干脆写：“限×日送×××元”。在蒋胡匪帮这种野蛮掠夺之下，一般农民土地收入的绝大部分甚至全部均被抢去，年年揭借，生活痛苦不堪。他们都盼望人民解放军快些去解放他们。
