Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th: A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army held a training class for deputy regimental commanders and battalion commanders to improve the tactical skills of commanders. In the study, the class used model commander Regiment Commander Ren Shihong as a model to examine everyone's command, fighting will, and tactical thinking.

Regiment Commander Ren Shihong's command characteristics: First, he carefully understood the situation and repeatedly reconnoitered the terrain and enemy situation before each battle. For example, during an attack on a city, he climbed to more than 30 meters from the city wall to personally view the terrain and jumped into the enemy's outer trench alone to measure its width and depth. In another battle, he observed changes in the enemy's situation in the mountains in the heavy rain. After discovering that the enemy was retreating, he pursued the enemy fiercely. Second, based on accurate enemy and terrain information, he carefully studied the method of fighting with lower-level and same-level cadres, persuaded them of incorrect opinions, and then made correct and decisive decisions. Third, once a decision was made, it was not easily changed, and unified command was emphasized to oppose a state of anarchy. Fourth, when assigning tasks to subordinates, he was simple and clear and was good at using enlightenment methods to teach subordinates how to overcome difficulties and complete tasks. He checked the tasks at any time after they were assigned. For example, during a battle, he went to the front alone to check the close-quarters operations of the First Battalion. After discovering the irresponsible shortcomings of the battalion cadres, he immediately convened a meeting of cadres at and below the battalion level to educate them and make a second, more specific arrangement. Fifth, he had the idea of actively eliminating the enemy. In a battle where he was ordered to cover the retreat, he commanded the troops to launch a surprise attack on the enemy, killing or wounding more than half of an enemy battalion before safely retreating. In another battle, the regiment was a reserve force. When other units were fighting, he carefully observed the enemy's situation and terrain, discovered the enemy's weaknesses, and suggested to his superiors that he be allowed to fight. He attacked the enemy's weak artillery positions, seized three enemy mountain guns, and struck the enemy's headquarters. Sixth, he had an overall concept and tenacious fighting will in combat. For example, in the Wazijie battle in Yichuan, when the enemy charged the a branch unit, the entire regiment fired at the enemy from the side, effectively cooperating with the brother units to defeat the enemy's more than 20 counter-charges.

During the discussion, the trainees of the training class, while studying in detail the command advantages of Regiment Commander Ren Shihong, compared them with the command shortcomings of a certain regimental commander, Yang Yizhong, who had been dismissed. They believed that Yang's fighting will was not strong, that he did not understand the terrain and enemy situation, and that he did not proceed from reality, but issued orders subjectively, resulting in five companies rushing into a narrow area at one time, causing unnecessary casualties. This comparative study of good and bad models was very educational for everyone.

At the end of the training class, the leaders of the unit called on new and old cadres to use their minds more often in the war, summarize practical experience, humbly study, learn new experiences and new theories, and skillfully apply command techniques and tactics.

　　西北某部办训练班学习战术指挥
  　以任世鸿团长为典型
　　检查指挥方法战斗意志战术思想
    【新华社西北十五日电】西北人民解放军某部为提高指挥员的战术素养，曾举办副团长、营长训练班。该班在学习中以模范指挥员任世鸿团长为典型，检查了各人的指挥、战斗意志、战术思想。任世鸿团长的指挥特点：一，每次战斗均认真了解情况，反复侦察地形和敌情。如某次攻城时，他爬至距城墙卅余米处亲看地形，独自跳入敌外壕测量宽深。另一次战斗中，他冒大雨在山头观察敌情变化，发现敌撤退后，就向敌猛追。二，根据确实的敌情地形，与下级和同级干部细心研究打的方法，对不正确的意见进行说服，然后正确果断地下达决心。三，决心一下不轻易改变，并强调统一指挥，反对无政府状态。四，给下级分配任务时简单明了，并善于用启发方法教导下级如何克服困难完成任务。任务布置后随时检查。如在某次战斗时，他独自摸到最前面去检查一营的近迫作业，发现该营干部不负责任的缺点，立即召集营以下各级干部会议，进行教育，并作第二次更具体的布置。五，具有积极消灭敌人的思想。在某次战斗中受命掩护撤退时，他指挥部队向敌人展开突然攻击，将敌一营杀伤过半，方才安然撤退。在另一次战斗中，该团为预备队，当别的部队进行战斗时，他仔细观察敌情地形，发现敌人弱点，向上级建议请战，向敌薄弱的炮兵阵地攻击，夺取了敌人三门山炮，打到敌人师部。六，在作战中有整体观念和顽强的战斗意志。如宜川瓦子街战斗中，当敌向某支队冲锋时，该团全团火力侧射敌人，有效地配合了兄弟部队打垮敌人二十多次的反冲锋。
    该训练班学员在讨论中，与详细研究任世鸿团长的指挥优点同时，将已被撤职的某团团长杨一中在指挥上的缺点拿来比较，认为杨的战斗意志不强，不了解地形敌情，不从实际出发，单从主观下达命令，以致有一次在一狭窄地带涌进五个连，造成不应有的伤亡。这种好坏典型的对比研究，对大家教育很大。
    训练班结束时，该部首长号召新老干部在战争中时时多用思想，总结实战经验，虚心研究，学习新经验新理论，巧妙地运用指挥技术与战术。
