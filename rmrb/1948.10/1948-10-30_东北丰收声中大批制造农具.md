Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st. Amidst the cheers of a bountiful harvest in Northeast China following land reform, local farm tool factories are supplying the countryside with farm tools on a large scale. Since August 20th, the farm tool factory in the Hejiang Province has been rushing to manufacture autumn harvest tools, and has now produced more than 90 carts, more than 100 corn threshers, and more than 20 rice threshers. Each thresher can thresh 2.5 shi of corn per person per day, saving more than 80% of labor compared to manual hand-rubbing. Before the autumn harvest, the Tongchang Iron Factory in Gushan County, Andong, made 50 carts and 2,500 sickles, which were sold to farmers in disaster areas at low prices, with payment agreed upon without interest after the autumn harvest. The factory now plans to continue manufacturing 300 carts and several new-style plows for use in the spring plowing next year. The vehicle manufacturing industry in Qiqihar has reached 78 companies. From January to August this year, they produced more than 2,200 vehicles, which were supplied to Nenjiang Province and also sold to Zhengjiatun (Liaoyuan) and Sipingjie in Liaobei Province.

　　东北丰收声中大批制造农具
    【新华社东北二十一日电】东北今年在土地改革后的丰收声中，各地农具制造厂以大批农具供应农村。合江省农具工厂自八月二十日开始赶制秋收农具，刻已制成大车九十余辆、苞米脱粒机百余架、打稻机二十余架。脱粒机每人每天可打苞米两石五斗，较人工手搓省工百分之八十以上。安东孤山县同昌铁工厂秋收前做成大车五十辆，镰刀二千五百把，低价售给灾区农民，约定秋收后无利付款。该厂现拟续制三百辆大车及新式犁杖多具，以供明年春耕使用。齐齐哈尔车辆制造业已达七十八家，今年一月到八月，产车二千二百余辆，除供应嫩江省外，且销至辽北省之郑家屯（辽源）、四平街一带。
