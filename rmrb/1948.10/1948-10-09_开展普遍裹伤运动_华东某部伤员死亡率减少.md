Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: A certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army launched a universal bandaging campaign among its officers and soldiers, which reduced the casualty rate in a certain battle by one-third. In the past, higher authorities instructed them to universally learn bandaging, but this did not attract their attention. After carrying out military democracy assessments of casualties and finding that the high mortality rate was due to the lack of timely bandaging, they decided that the entire unit should learn bandaging techniques. After four or five days of study and experimentation, 98% of all soldiers learned head bandaging, 90% learned torso bandaging, and 93% learned limb bandaging. Before this campaign, hygiene soldier training classes and health worker training were conducted, and then they assisted doctors in teaching each soldier. In-depth mobilization was also carried out to overcome erroneous ideas such as "this is the business of hygiene departments and health workers." During the learning process, emphasis was placed on practical exercises, and some first-aid common sense was explained, followed by repeated practice and research, as well as field battlefield first-aid exercises. Before this XX battle, the slogan was put forward: "Bandage on the spot where injured, bandage anytime when injured, self-bandage when self-injured, mutual bandage when comrades are injured." Everyone truly realized these slogans, thus creating a remarkable achievement in reducing sacrifices by launching a mass bandaging campaign.

　　开展普遍裹伤运动
    华东某部伤员死亡率减少
    【新华社华东七日电】华东解放军某部开展指战员普遍裹伤运动，曾使他们在某次战斗中的伤员死亡率减少三分之一。过去上级指示普遍学习包扎，但未引起他们重视；自开展军事民主评伤亡时，找出死亡率大，是因为未及时包扎所致后，他们乃决定部队全体要学会包伤技术。经过四五天的学习与实验，全体战士学会头部包扎者百分之九十八，学会躯干包扎者百分之九十，学会四肢包扎者百分之九十三。在此项运动之前开办了卫生战士训练班及卫生员训练之后再由他们协助医生去教会每个战士，并进行了深入动员，克服了“这是卫生机关与卫生员的事”等错误思想。学习时着重实际练习，讲述一些救护常识，即进行反复练习研究，并到野外进行战场救护演习。这次××战斗前又提出口号“当地受伤当地包，随时受伤随时包，自己受伤自己包，同志受伤互相包”。大家都真正地实现了这些口号，因而创造了开展群众性裹伤运动减少牺牲的显著成绩。
