[From the Pingjin-Baoding Front] A front-line reporter's account of the annihilation of bandit Wang Fenggang's main force of more than 2,000 men states: On October 2nd, Wang Fenggang's main force, the first security brigade of Hebei and the Qinghe detachment, totaling more than 3,000 men, who were trusted henchmen of the bandit Fu Zuoyi, sneaked into the area of Banjiowo, Da and Xiao Liuminzhuang, Gaoqiao, and Xiaoying in northern Xiong County, attempting to loot grain and conscript men. Our People's Liberation Army unit surrounded them with a sudden move. Before dawn on October 3rd, they first annihilated more than 100 men of the Qinghe detachment. At 9:00 AM, our army launched a full-scale attack on the First Security Brigade. A certain unit, with lightning speed, launched a fierce attack in several directions on the third regiment of the brigade, which was entrenched in Xiao Liuminzhuang. The soldiers of a certain unit first rushed to seize the enemy's forward position, and the enemy was annihilated before they could even fire their guns. This unit then continued to rush into the enemy's depths. Another unit also charged in from the southwest corner. Most of bandit Wang's third regiment was annihilated, the enemy regimental commander Hua Guanqun was wounded, and the deputy regimental commander Wang Enyuan was captured. At the same time, another unit of our army launched a fierce attack on the first and second regiments, which were entrenched in Da Liuminzhuang. When our army stormed into the village with lightning speed, the enemy was immediately thrown into chaos, unable to resist. The bandit brigade commander Xie Daqian fled in panic with his remaining soldiers to the north. However, they were intercepted by a certain unit of our army. At this time, the enemy had been cut into four parts by our army. The embarrassed enemy fled in all directions, corpses littered the ground, and they were utterly defeated. The remnants fled south of Mao Gong Temple, where most of them were annihilated by our army. By 1:00 PM, the battle was completely victorious. Apart from several hundred enemies who escaped, we killed and captured a total of more than 2,600 enemies. Wang Fenggang's sinister enemy of the people in the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area, the capital he started with, was largely annihilated.

[Pingjin-Baoding Front, 15th dispatch] The following are supplementary battle results of the People's Liberation Army's annihilation of most of the First Security Brigade of bandit Wang Fenggang and a part of its Qinghe Detachment in Banjiowo, southeast of Xincheng, on the 3rd of this month: 2,087 enemies were captured, and 520 enemies were killed or wounded, for a total of 2,607 enemies killed, wounded, or captured. 1,320 rifles and carbines, 48 light machine guns, 9 heavy machine guns, 3 mortars, 13 60mm mortars, 100,888 rounds of ammunition, 161 shells of various types, 2 radio stations, 23 war horses and pack mules, and 18 bicycles were seized.
