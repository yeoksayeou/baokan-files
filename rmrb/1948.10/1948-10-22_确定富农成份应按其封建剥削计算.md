　　Determining a Rich Peasant's Class Status Should Be Based on Their Feudal Exploitation
　　Question: I have some questions regarding the calculation of exploitation volume, please answer:
　　(1) Should a rich peasant's industrial and commercial exploitation be calculated together with their feudal exploitation such as employing laborers and high-interest loans, and rent, or should they be calculated separately? In practice, some calculate them together and some separately, each with its own reason. One opinion is that the 25% exploitation volume refers to all exploitation (both capitalist and feudal), so they should be calculated together. Another opinion is that if feudal exploitation and capitalist industrial and commercial exploitation are calculated together, it will raise the class status, and past infringements on industry and commerce were caused by calculating them together and raising the class status. Which statement is correct? Please answer.
　　(2) For pure landlords and pure creditors, their net income is their gross income. Then, for a rich peasant who also has some land for rent or lends money, can we say the same?
　　(3) Doctors, elementary school teachers, and revolutionary soldiers are all considered as main laborers. Then, when calculating the exploitation volume of their families, what should be included in their total income? How should the exploitation volume be calculated?

　　Answer: (1) The main characteristic of a rich peasant is that on the one hand, they are independent laborers; on the other hand, they often rely on income from exploiting laborers or other feudal exploitation through semi-feudal methods as their main or important source of livelihood. Some rich peasants also engage in industry and commerce and have capitalist exploitation income. Therefore, when determining a rich peasant's class status, the main thing is to see whether the total of their various feudal and semi-feudal exploitation income exceeds 25%. The capitalist exploitation part generated by their concurrent industrial and commercial operations should not be calculated together with the feudal exploitation part, because under the New Democratic economic system, only feudal and semi-feudal exploitation is eliminated. Industrial and commercial production is beneficial to the national economy, and the capitalist exploitation generated by operating industrial and commercial production is allowed to exist. However, if a farmer's feudal exploitation part already accounts for 25% of their total income, and they also have other capitalist exploitation, they should be classified as a rich peasant.
　　(2) For pure landlords and creditors, their gross income is their net income, because in addition to feudal land ownership and feudal creditor's rights from high-interest loans, they do not participate in labor or invest in costs for the entire production process. If a rich peasant also has some land for rent or lends money, they are the same as pure landlords and creditors in terms of renting land and collecting rent and lending money and collecting interest. However, because rich peasants do not simply rent land and lend money, they also participate in main labor or employ laborers to cultivate the land, and they have to spend costs such as draught animals, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers for the production process, so their gross income cannot be equal to their net income.
　　(3) Doctors, elementary school teachers, and revolutionary soldiers are all considered main laborers, and their income should be included in their family's total income. The income of doctors and teachers themselves does not include exploitation income (because they themselves are considered laborers), so when calculating the exploitation volume of their families, only the actual exploitation volume of their families should be calculated. As for revolutionary soldiers, they actually have no income themselves. If their families employ laborers to cultivate the land due to lack of labor, it is not considered exploitation. When calculating the exploitation volume of their families, the surplus value produced by the laborers who replace their labor should not be included in the exploitation volume. In addition, if there is other feudal exploitation, it should be calculated as usual.

### 确定富农成份应按其封建剥削计算

　　确定富农成份应按其封建剥削计算
    问：在计算剥削量的问题上，我有几个疑问请答复：
    （一）富农的工商业剥削与对雇工及其他高利贷地租等封建剥削，是合并计算，还是分别计算？工作中有的合并有的分别，各执一理。一说百分之二十五的剥削量是指一切剥削（资本主义的和封建的）在内，故合并计算。另一说认为如把封建剥削和资本主义的工商业剥削合并计算，即提高成份，过去侵犯工商业就是因为合并计算而提高成份所致。那个说法对？请答复。
    （二）地租、债息对纯地主纯债主来说其纯收入就是总收入，那么对富农兼有部分土地出租或放债，是否也可这样说？
    （三）医生、小学教员、革命战士都算作为主要劳动，那么在计算其家中剥削量时，其总收入应包括什么？剥削量如何计算？

    答：（一）富农的主要特征，是其一方面为独立劳动者；一方面经常依靠以半封建方法剥削雇工或其他封建剥削的收入作为其主要或重要生活来源。有的富农并兼营工商业，还有资本主义的剥削收入，所以在确定富农成份的时候，主要是看其各种封建半封建剥削收入的总和是否超过百分之二十五。其兼营工商业所产生的资本主义剥削部分，不应与封建剥削部分合并计算，因为在新民主主义经济制度之下，只消灭封建半封建剥削，工商业生产有益于国民经济，经营工商业生产所产生的资本主义剥削是允许其存在的。但假如某农民的封建剥削部分已占其总收入百分之二十五，如尚有其他资本主义剥削，则应划成富农成份。
    （二）纯粹地主、债主，其总收入即其纯收入，因为他们除了封建土地所有权，及高利贷的封建债权而外，对于全部生产过程不参加劳动，不投入成本。富农如兼有部分土地出租，或放债，在出租土地收取地租及放债收利息这一点上，和纯粹地主债主相同。但因为富农不单纯出租土地、放债，他自己还参加主要劳动或雇工耕种，对生产过程得花费耕畜、农具、籽种、肥料等成本，所以其总收入不能等于纯收入。
    （三）医生、小学教员、革命战士都算主要劳动，他们的收入应算入其家庭总收入之内。医生、教员本人的收入不包含剥削收入，（因他本人即算劳动者）所以计算其家庭的剥削量时，只按其家庭实际的剥削量计算。至于革命战士，其本人实际上没有什么收入，其家庭因缺乏劳力而雇工耕种，则不算剥削。在计算其家庭的剥削量时，对代替其劳动的雇工所生产的剩余价值，不应计入剥削量内。此外，如有其他封建剥削，则照样计算。
