Xinhua News Agency, North China, 7th. According to an urgent telegram from the Yellow River Committee of Hebei, Shandong and Henan: The water level of the Yellow River has risen sharply, and the Gao Cun in the Dongming section of the First Repair and Defense Office on the south bank, as well as the Zhu Kou and Liu Zhuang embankments in the Nanhua section (newly established county, parts of Dongming and Heze), are again in critical condition. On the night of September 30th, the Gao Cun embankment was flooded, and by 6:00 PM on October 1st, the water had risen one meter, and the main current had shifted southward, directly impacting the 15th dam. The 13th dam of the Zhu Kou and Liu Zhuang embankments sank into the water on September 28th under the impact of the flood. By October 3rd, the 16th, 17th, and 18th dams were all losing stakes. Our repair and defense personnel are working hard to transport materials for emergency repairs. The Yellow River Committee has telegraphed all sections along the river to immediately go to the dikes for flood prevention.
