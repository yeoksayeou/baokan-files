　　Beating Your Wife Is Also Illegal
  　A Letter from the Head of Pingshan First District Explains the Truth About the Assault

To the Editor:

    The article "Don't Arrest and Beat People Lightly" in People's Daily No. 124 contains discrepancies with the actual situation. I would like to provide the following explanation:

    Lu Haichang is not a demobilized veteran. He left the army without proper procedures and resided in Pingshan East Street. He married Cui Guoguo two years ago. This spring, Lu also committed adultery with Xiao Nini, which led to him frequently beating and scolding Guoguo. This was the seventh time he had beaten his wife. The matter escalated to the district office. The district committee, led by Lao Kang, tried to dissuade him, but it was ineffective. After returning home, Lu locked himself in and acted violently, stepping on Guoguo's stomach, causing her to bleed. Two or three women from the neighborhood reported this to the district office. Finally, they broke open the window and managed to pull him away. At this point, Guoguo's left arm was already dislocated, and she lay on the ground unable to move. District cadres then called Lu to the district office for a talk (not an arrest). I asked Lu, "Why did you beat your wife?" Lu replied, "Why can't I beat my wife? After fighting for several years in the War of Resistance, can't I even beat my wife? Is that illegal?" I said, "You can't beat her. It's wrong to beat her!" Lu said, "If you say it's wrong, then come and shoot me! I don't think you dare!" As he spoke, Lu slammed the table and stretched his head forward, daring me to kill him. I rebuked him for being a rogue. He then tried to leave, so I ordered people to tie him up and bind him in the courtyard (without hanging him). That night, I talked to him. He again slammed the table. I then slapped him twice and hit him twice with a stick. Only then did he admit to having an affair with Xiao Nini and that he deliberately wanted to beat his original wife, Cui Guoguo, until she divorced him. (The district office has a record of this.) That night, Lu was detained. Lu claimed, "I submit verbally but not in my heart. I'll talk when I get out." He also told the guard, "I originally planned to divorce my wife, but now I won't. I'll torment her until I can beat her to death in the Western Hills." The next day, I reported this to the county government and admitted that it was wrong for me to hit him. The county instructed me to immediately send Lu to the county judicial section. The judicial section has now sentenced Lu to one year in prison. The people of East Street (especially the women) expressed satisfaction with the government's handling of the matter, saying, "This is true protection for women."

    I believe that Lu Haichang's brutal beating of his wife is illegal and constitutes a crime in progress, and he should be punished. Of course, it was wrong of me to hit him at the time. The next day, I made a self-criticism when I reported to the county government. However, Comrade Guo Enqing's one-sided reflection and its publication in the newspaper have had a negative impact. The cadres of the First District feel that it does not fully align with the facts and are dissatisfied. Some people in Pingshan East Street also reflected, "Shouldn't the district cadres intervene when someone beats his wife so brutally?" They feel that the opinion in the newspaper is unfair. Therefore, I request that this be published as a correction.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Pingshan First District Head　Feng Laishu　October 23

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　

Editor's Note: Head Feng's explanation and self-criticism are very necessary. First of all, it should be affirmed that it is wrong for cadres of our democratic government to resort to violence (Comrade Feng has also made a self-criticism on this point). In addition, when we handled Comrade Guo Enqing's reflection, the manuscript itself did not explain the egregious behavior of Lu beating his wife. We also lacked serious and careful repeated study during the handling process and only emphasized the point that the district cadres should not beat people (which is of course correct). However, we did not make any accusations or criticisms of Lu's behavior of beating his wife, which made the masses feel that the opinion was unfair. In addition to our own self-criticism, we hope that Comrade Guo Enqing will also pay attention to ensuring that reflections on problems are comprehensive and factual.

### 毒打老婆也是犯法　平山一区区长来信说明打人真象

　　毒打老婆也是犯法
  　平山一区区长来信说明打人真象编辑同志：
    人民日报第一二四号报载批评与建议“不要轻易捕人打人”一文，与实际情况有出入，特作说明如下：
    卢海昌并不是荣退军人，是从部队没手续下来的，寄居平山东街，娶妻崔果果已二年，今春卢又与肖妮妮通奸，因之对果果经常打骂，这次已是第七次打老婆。事情直闹到区公所，经区委老康劝说也无效，卢回家后即闭门逞凶，将脚踩在果果肚子上，踩得流血流沫，街坊两三个妇女到区报告，最后将窗子闹开，才算拉住。这时果果左臂已经脱了骨，躺在地上不能动，区干部便将卢叫到区里谈话（并非逮捕），我问卢：“你为么打老婆？”卢答：“我的老婆为么不能打？抗战几年，还不能打老婆？这还犯法？”我说：“不能打，你打就是错误！”卢说：“你说错误，你就来枪杀刀砍！我看你也不敢！”说着卢并大拍桌子，将头伸过来叫杀他，我斥责他不要耍无赖，他便要走，这才叫人将他捆起来，缚在院里（并没吊）。当夜我找他谈，他又大拍桌子，我便打了他两巴掌两棍子，他才承认和肖妮妮通奸，对原妻崔果果存心要打得她离婚。（区有存卷）当夜便押下卢。卢称：“我口服心不服，出去再说。”并对看守员说：“早先打算和老婆离婚，现在不离了，等把她闹到西山打死就完了。”第二天，我向县作了报告，并承认我打人不对，县指示马上将卢送县司法科，现在司法科已判卢一年徒刑。东街群众（特别是妇女）对政府处理办法表示满意说：“这才真保障妇女了。”
    我认为：卢海昌这样痛打他老婆，是不合法的，是现行犯，应受处罚，当然我当时打了他，是不对的，第二天，我向县政府报告就作了检讨。但郭恩庆同志这样片面的反映，在报纸上发表出以后影响是不大好的，一区干部们感到与事实不全符合，不满意，平山东街有些群众也反映：“那样痛打老婆区干部就不能管管。”觉得报纸上那个意见是不公平的。故特请登报补正。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　平山一区区长　封来恕　十月二十三日
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：封区长这个说明与检讨是很必要的。首先应该肯定我们民主政府的干部动手打人是不对的（这点封同志也作了检讨）。另外，在我们处理郭恩庆同志反映那个意见时，因稿件本身对卢打老婆的恶劣行为没有说明，我们处理时也缺乏认真仔细的反复研究，只强调了区干不该打人这一点（当然这是对的），但对卢打老婆行为则未加任何指责和批评，因此使群众感到意见不公平。这点除我们自己检讨外，希郭恩庆同志也要注意，反映问题要力求全面和实际。
