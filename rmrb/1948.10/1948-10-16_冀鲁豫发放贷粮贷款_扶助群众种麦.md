　　Ji-Lu-Yu Issues Grain Loans to Help the Masses Plant Wheat
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Dispatch] To solve the difficulties faced by the masses in obtaining wheat seeds and livestock, the Ji-Lu-Yu branch of the North China Bank has recently allocated 3,050,000 jin of wheat and 300 million Ji banknotes to various sub-districts, which have begun distribution. The majority of the aforementioned wheat, in addition to addressing the wheat seed shortage, is intended for purchasing livestock.
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Dispatch] In Juan City, due to years of war and the escape of landlords, 500 hectares of land have become barren. However, some of the masses are afraid of a change in the political climate, while others fear heavy burdens, and thus dare not plant. Recently, through the government's vigorous propaganda emphasizing the victorious situation and the policy of "whoever plants, harvests" and bearing burdens according to the harvest yield, farmers have begun to actively divide the land for planting. Currently, 400 hectares of barren land have been planted with wheat.

  　扶助群众种麦
    【冀鲁豫电】华北银行冀鲁豫区行，为了解决群众麦种及牲口困难，特于最近拨到各分署麦子三百零五万斤，冀钞三亿元，各分区已开始发放。上述麦子除解决麦种困难外，大部用于购买牲口。
    【冀鲁豫电】鄄城因连年战争及地主逃亡，荒地达五百顷，但群众有的怕变天，有的怕负担重，都不敢种。最近经政府大力宣传胜利形势和谁种谁收，按年成负担等政策，农民开始积极分着种，现已将四百顷荒地种了麦。
