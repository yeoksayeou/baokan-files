Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 19th. In order to improve farming methods and greatly increase grain production, the Construction Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government is specifically promoting the planting of "Mun Gu" (winter foxtail millet) and the construction of dams, weirs, and terraced fields. Last autumn, Zhidan County experimented with planting more than 400 mu of "Mun Gu," proving that this type of farming has five benefits: drought resistance, pest resistance, higher yield, maturity 20 days earlier, and thicker and stronger millet straw, increasing straw yield. Ma Hanquan, a farmer from Zhangcha Village, Five Townships, Anse County, planted 50 mu, yielding a total of 15 shi of coarse grain, with an average yield per mu being one to two dou more than spring foxtail millet. The method for planting "Mun Gu" is: in July or August of the lunar calendar, or after the autumn harvest, plow the land (preferably choose a sunny location), without breaking up the clods; before the ground freezes at the beginning of winter, scatter the millet seeds, preferably the "Da Ri Yue Huang" foxtail millet, sow them thickly, rake them flat, and have sheep trample them over. The millet seedlings will sprout in the depressions trampled by the sheep hooves in the coming spring, sheltered from the wind and less likely to be killed by frost. This type of farming can adjust labor for cultivation after autumn, thus increasing the planting area, which is of great significance for launching a large-scale production campaign next year.

Repairing dams and weirs and building terraced fields can retain water and reduce drought losses. Dam and weir land contains more moisture; the drier the weather and the more abundant the sunshine, the more bountiful the harvest. As long as deep plowing, careful cultivation, and diligent weeding are carried out, each dui (eight dui make one xiang) can yield one to one and a half shi of sorghum per year, and the harvest from one xiang of dam and weir land is at least equivalent to the yield of five xiang of flat ridge land. If all the mountain gullies in the Suide sub-region were to have dams and weirs built, it is estimated that cultivated land could be increased by a quarter. Terraced fields are made by turning flat ridge land into step-like flat strips of land, which are not afraid of drought or flood, retain fertile soil, and are drought-resistant and high-yielding when crops are planted; the harvest from one xiang of terraced fields can be equivalent to two xiang of good slope land. The Border Region Government has formally decided to establish a water and soil conservation working group in the northeastern part of Suide County to mobilize the masses to build dams and repair terraced fields. The Construction Department also plans to invest in dam construction there.

  　陕甘宁边府建设厅提倡种闷谷修坝堰
    【新华社西北十九日电】为改良农作法，大量增产粮食，陕甘宁边区政府建设厅特提倡种闷谷（冬谷子）和修坝堰、梯田。去年秋天，志丹县曾试种闷谷四百余亩，证明此种作务有五个好处：耐旱，虫不吃，产量多，早熟二十余天，谷草长得粗壮，增加收草量。安塞县五乡张岔村农民马汉全种了五十亩，共打粗粮十五石，平均每亩产量比春谷子多收一斗至二斗。种闷谷的方法是：在旧历七八月或秋收以后，将地翻过（选向阳地较好），不打土块；到立冬地冻前，撒上谷种，最好是大日月黄谷子，下得稠些，用耙耙平，放羊踏过，来春谷苗出在羊蹄子踏过的凹处，风吹不着，不易冻死。此种农作可在秋后调剂劳力耕种，因此可以增加种地面积，对明年开展大生产运动有极大意义。
    修坝堰和梯田，可以保持水地，减少旱灾损失。坝堰地含水分多，天气越旱，阳光越充足，就越能丰收。只要深耕细作勤锄，每堆（八堆合一垧）每年可收高粱一石至一石五斗，一垧坝堰地收获至少合五垧平梁地产量。绥德分区若全部山沟都打了坝堰，估计约可增加耕地四分之一。梯田是把平梁正地修成阶梯形的平条地，不怕旱涝，保持肥土，种上庄稼，耐旱而丰收，一垧梯田收获可抵两垧好坡地。边区政府已正式决定在绥德县东北部成立水地保持工作组，发动群众打坝修梯田。建设厅并计划在该处投资打坝。
