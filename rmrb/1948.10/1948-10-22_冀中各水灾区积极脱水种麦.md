(Jizhong Electric) Jizhong disaster areas are tensely engaged in sowing wheat. According to incomplete statistics from over 350 waterlogged villages in Anping, Raoyang, and Xianxian along the Hutuo River; Anguo, Gaoyang, and Renqiu along the Zhurong River; Qingyuan in the lower reaches of the Tang River; Anxin within Baiyang Lake; and Wenxin in Wen'an Depression, more than 145,800 mu of waterlogged land has been drained. Most of it has already been sown with wheat. In order to sow a large amount of wheat, the Second District of Anping mobilized more than 1,000 people from September 12th to 21st to improve the 12-li long Shunhe ditch, repair 303 zhang of new embankments, and block 29 breaches. They also dug diversion canals to drain more than 8,000 mu of accumulated water in the low-lying areas. Now, except for villages such as Zhongzhangying, which cannot be sown because the water has just receded, other villages have largely completed sowing, with approximately 12,000 mu of wheat planted, more than 800 mu more than last year. Raoyang also mobilized the masses to block the three breaches along the Hutuo River at Dongcaoqi and other places, and built a five-li long wheat protection embankment south of Lvhan Village, draining more than 5,000 mu of waterlogged land, and is now vigorously rushing to sow wheat. In Xianxian, 48 waterlogged villages in three districts have had all waterlogged land drained in 17 villages, and part of the land drained in 23 villages, with more than 100,000 mu of waterlogged land drained, accounting for more than 63 percent of the total land area. More than 84,000 mu have been sown. In the 13th District of the county, more than 73 percent of the drained land has been sown. In order to actively expand the wheat sowing area, the district proposed that all places that can be tilled should be tilled. In Shuangcun Lishuhangli, fieldsides, river slopes, and other places, more than 180 mu were tilled. In Wenxin, villages near Wen'an Depression are flooded every year when sowing wheat. This year, the county mobilized the masses to raise and thicken the first line of flood control embankments, protecting 140,000 mu of land from flooding, allowing for 25,000 mu to be sown with wheat. In the Fifth District of the county, seven villages including Xugezhuang built more than 2,000 gong of flood control embankments, protecting 5,000 mu of wheat fields. Villages in the First District of Anxin near Baiyang Lake also built a five-li long flood control embankment, protecting 1,300 mu of land from flooding, and are now sowing wheat. In addition, the masses in waterlogged villages in Anguo, Suning, Rongxian, and Dacheng counties are also actively sowing wheat. Party and government organs in various places are vigorously helping the disaster-stricken masses solve their difficulties. In addition to organizing the masses to block breaches, dig drainage ditches, and build dikes, various places are promoting cooperative loans to provide a large amount of wheat seeds to help the masses solve the problem of seed shortage. Renqiu loaned out more than 16,000 jin of wheat seeds, and the Second District of Anping loaned out more than 4,900 jin. For villages lacking manpower and animal power, the masses are mobilized to borrow livestock from areas without wheat sowing, or to pull plows by hand, and to organize mutual aid in labor. In Hou Liuxingzhuang, with more than 100 households in Anping, 17 mutual aid groups were organized to solve the difficulty of lacking manpower and animal power. Zhongzhangying organized 21 groups, mobilizing men, women, old and young to go to the fields, quickly completing sowing.

　　冀中各水灾区积极脱水种麦
    【冀中电】冀中各水灾区正紧张进行种麦。据滹沱河沿岸的安平、饶阳、献县，潴龙河沿岸的安国、高阳、任邱，唐河下游的清苑及白洋淀内的安新，文安洼内的文新等县三百五十余水灾村庄极不完全统计，已脱出水涝地十四万五千八百余亩。其中大部已种上了麦子。安平二区为大量种麦，从九月十二到二十一日，发动一千余人，将十二里地的顺河沟打好，修好三百零三丈新埝，堵决口二十九处。并挖引水河排泄洼地积水八千余亩。现除中张营等村因水刚脱落不能种麦外，其他村已大体完成，种麦约一万二千余亩，比去年多种八百余亩。侥阳亦动员群众将滹沱河沿岸东草蕲等三处决口堵好，并在吕汉村南修一道五里长的护麦埝，脱出水涝地五千余亩，正大力突击种麦。献县三个区四十八个水灾村，已有十七个村水涝地全部脱出，二十三个村脱出一部，脱出水涝地十万余亩，占总地数的百分之六十三以上。已种上了八万四千余亩。该县十三区百分之七十三以上的水脱地已完成播种。该区为积极扩大种麦面积，提出凡能耩的地方都耩上。按双村梨树行里、场边、河坡等处，耩了一百八十余亩。文新靠近文安洼附近村庄，每年种麦都被水淹，今年该县发动群众将第一道防水埝增高培厚，使十四万亩地免除水灾，可种麦二万五千亩。该县五区许各庄等七村，修筑了二千余弓防水埝后，护住了五千亩麦地。安新靠近白洋淀的一区各村，亦修筑了一道五里长的防水埝，使一千三百亩地免除水患，现正进行种麦。此外如安国、肃宁、容县、大城等县水灾村群众，也正积极种麦。各地党政机关，都以大力帮助灾区群众解决困难，除组织群众堵口、挖泄水沟、筑堤以外，各地推进社贷出大批麦种，帮助群众解决耔种困难。任邱贷出麦种一万六千余斤，安平二区贷出四千九百余斤。对人畜力缺乏的村庄，则发动群众到无种麦的地区借牲口，或人拉耠子，组织劳动互助。安平一百多户的后刘兴庄，为解决人畜力缺少的困难，组织了十七个互助组，中张营组织了二十一组，发动男女老幼下地，很快的完成播种。
