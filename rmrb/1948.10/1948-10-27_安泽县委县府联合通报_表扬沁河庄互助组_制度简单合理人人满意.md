[Taiyue News] The joint office of the Anze County Party Committee and County Government recently issued a circular commending the Qinhe Village Mutual Aid Group in the Fourth District. Qinhe Village has a total of sixteen households, most of whom are refugees who fled from Shandong during famine years. When mutual aid organizations were advocated in the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), they voluntarily formed labor exchange groups, and have continued to do so ever since. Nineteen men with full or partial labor capacity, thirteen women with full or partial labor capacity, and eight children regularly participate in labor exchange, along with eleven cattle. After several years of hard work, they have transformed the barren and impoverished Qinhe Village into a prosperous one. Last year, under the influence of "leftist" errors, production enthusiasm was temporarily affected, but after correcting the errors this year, the momentum of production quickly recovered. This autumn, they plowed all 159 mu of wheat land in the group twice, some even three times, applied an average of 40 dan of fertilizer per mu of wheat land, ground soybean cakes into fine powder, mixed it with the wheat seeds before sowing, and harvested all 77 mu of millet in a timely manner. They are now preparing to move corn, dig peanuts, and turn over the autumn land. Why has their mutual aid group been able to consolidate for a long time? The reasons are: (1) Group leader Gao Junwu does not use administrative orders or coercive methods to lead everyone, but rather relies on his own demonstration, promotion, and influence. This spring, when planting indigo, everyone was initially unwilling to plant it, so he planted it first. When everyone saw that he had planted it, they followed suit. As a result, the entire group planted 14 mu of indigo, yielding 1,050 jin, which, calculated at 4,000 yuan per jin, could be exchanged for more than 4.2 million yuan. Everyone received practical benefits, and everyone was willing to participate in mutual aid. (2) They have regular democratic habits. They discuss matters together, but do not spend special time holding meetings. They discuss matters during meal times and in the gaps between working in the fields. Everyone feels happy with life, the leadership method is good, and the interest in labor is also improved. (3) For every task they do, or every agricultural stage (such as weeding, summer harvest, wheat planting, autumn harvest), they first accurately calculate how much labor is required based on the size of the task, and act according to the plan. People often say: "Silver and gold are everywhere, but it's a waste of effort without a plan." They have grasped this planning aspect, so every task is done faster than in other villages. (4) They settle accounts in stages according to the agricultural season. They say: settling accounts piecemeal is too troublesome. As long as the accounts are recorded well, and the accounts are settled after a stage of work is completed, it is easier to record, easier to settle, and reduces missed workdays. Men and women exchange labor based on the job. Men exchange labor for heavy work, while women and children do manual labor, calculating points based on the work. This improves the production enthusiasm of women and children, and allows men to save time for intensive cultivation. Even if men are conscripted for service, the land will not be abandoned. (5) Group leader Gao Junwu is an experienced old farmer with rich agricultural knowledge. A few days ago, while working in the field, he discovered that the sorghum and millet were turning green again. He called on everyone to quickly harvest the millet. Some people did not believe it, saying, "A poor wheat harvest doesn't make much of a scene, a poor millet harvest doesn't produce much rice, and you can't harvest it if it's not green." Junwu then led everyone to the field to check, and indeed the sorghum leaves and millet were turning from yellow to green, and the ears were also turning greenish-yellow, with green liquid squeezing out of each grain. Everyone believed him and organized the harvest.

　　安泽县委县府联合通报
  　表扬沁河庄互助组
  　制度简单合理人人满意
    【太岳讯】安泽县委与县府联合办公室顷通报表扬四区沁河庄互助组。沁河庄共有十六户人家，大都是灾荒年从山东逃荒来的难民。在民国三十三年号召组织互助时，他们就自愿结合组织变工，从那时一直到现在。经常参加变工的男全半劳力十九个，女全半劳力十三个，儿童八个，耕牛十一头。经过几年努力，把荒芜穷困的沁河庄，变成了一个富足的庄子。在去年左倾错误影响下，生产情绪曾一时的受到影响，但在今年提出纠偏后，生产劲头很快就又恢复起来。今秋他们将全组的一百五十九亩麦地全部犁过二遍，有的还犁了三遍，每亩麦地平均上粪四十担，并把豆饼用滚碾细，和麦子搅在一起下了种，并把全组的七十七亩谷子及时割完，现正准备搬玉茭、刨花生、垡秋地。他们的互助组为什么能长期巩固呢？原因是：（一）组长高俊武领导大家不是用什么行政命令和强迫办法，而是凭他带头实验，推动和影响大家，今春种蓝时，开始大家都不愿种，他便先去栽种，大家看到他种上了，也都跟着去种，结果全组种蓝十四亩，打蓝一千零五十斤，每斤按四千元计，可变洋四百二十多万元。大家得到了实际利益，谁也情愿参加互助。（二）他们有经常的民主习惯，有事情大家商量，但又不费专门的时间召开会议，商量事情都是抽吃饭的时间和在地里劳动的空隙。大家觉得生活愉快，领导方法好，劳动兴趣也就随之提高。（三）他们每做一件活，或每一个农事阶段（如锄苗、夏收、种麦、秋收），都是先根据活的大小，精确地计算需用多少工，按计划办事。人常说：“白银黄金遍地生，没有计划枉费心”，他们就掌握了这个计划性，所以每一件活都比其他村干的快。（四）根据农时季节分段算帐，他们说：零星算帐太麻烦，只要把帐记好，把一段活做完后再算帐，这样也好记，也好结算，又少误工。男女变工是按活计工，男人变工干重活，妇女儿童干手头活，按活计算分数。提高了妇女儿童生产积极性，使男人节省出时间来精耕细作。男人支差参战走了，地也荒不了。（五）组长高俊武是一个富有农业经验的老农民，前几天他在地劳动，发现高梁和谷子又犯青了。就号召大家赶快割谷。有些人不相信，并说：“麦歉不少出面，谷歉不多出米，不断青不能割。”俊武便领着大家去地检查，确实高粱叶谷子都由黄变青，穗也变成青黄色了，颗颗也是一挤一股青水。大家相信了，便组织收割。
