Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: London - As the British Labour government put forward its so-called "Rearmament and Delayed Recovery Plan" and obtained the "unconditional support" of the Conservative Party, the British people launched protests and demonstrations against the "war policy." According to Diantong News Agency, "Since the conscription movement began, each conscription meeting has been concluded with a demonstration for peace." This was the case when war-mongers such as Alexander, the British Minister of Defense, Montgomery, the Chief of the General Staff, Churchill, the leader of the Conservative Party, and Eden delivered speeches at conscription rallies in various parts of London from October 4th to 6th. When Alexander was speaking, banners reading "We want peace, not war!" and "No fighting for dollars!" were unfurled in the crowd. Demonstrators shouted peace slogans and distributed leaflets at Montgomery's speech. Churchill and Eden's speeches were interrupted by the protests of the masses, and pamphlets reading "No fighting for dollars" rained down on the audience. On the 3rd, British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt fiercely condemned the warmongers in Sheffield and warned, "If these madmen want to push us into war, we will organize the largest strike our country has ever seen." The British Communist Party's organ, the Daily Worker, also published an article exposing the harm of "rearmament" to the British people. The newspaper pointed out, "Every extra penny spent on armaments comes from the blood and sweat of the working people. It deprives them of food, deprives them of housing, deprives industry of urgently needed manpower, hits exports, and accumulates future unemployment by reducing productive expenditures (referring to fixed capital such as machinery, equipment, and factories)."

　　英国人民反对备战
    掀起抗议和示威运动
    【新华社陕北十一日电】伦敦讯：当英国工党政府提出所谓“重整军备延缓复原计划”并取得保守党的“无条件支持”之时，英国人民掀起了反对“战争政策”的抗议和示威运动。据电通社称，“自从征兵运动开始以来，各次征兵会议都是以争取和平的示威宣告结束的。”十月四日至六日，英政府国防部长亚历山大、参谋总长蒙哥马利、保守党党魁邱吉尔、艾登等战争贩子在伦敦各地征兵大会上发表演说时的情形就是如此。当亚历山大演说之时，群众队伍中展开了“我们要和平不要战争！”“不为美元作战！”的旗帜。示威群众在蒙哥马利的演说会上高呼和平口号并散发传单。邱吉尔和艾登的演说为群众的抗议呼喊所阻断，那时，“不为美元作战”的小册子象骤雨般落到听众身上。英共总书记波立特于三日在设菲尔德痛斥战贩，并发出警告称，“如果这些疯人们要将我们推入战争的话，我们就将组织我国从未见过的最大的罢工。”英共机关报工人日报亦著论揭露“重整军备”对于英国人民的危害。该报指出，“额外花在军备上的每一辨士（英国辅币），都是劳动人民的血汗。这是夺去他们口里的食物，夺去他们的房屋，使工业得不到急需的人力，打击出口并因减低生产性的费用（按指机器、装备、厂房等不变资本的支）出而积蓄着将来的失业军。”
