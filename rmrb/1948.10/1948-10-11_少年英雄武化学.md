　　Young Hero Wu Huaxue
　　Comrade Wu Huaxue is a machine gunner in the Qibin County Workers' Team. He is sixteen years old this year, but he has been tempered and become very strong in the struggle in the heart of southwestern Shandong. One day, the enemy's Fifth Army came in three routes to attack Liuqiao. A squad of nine members of the Workers' Team ambushed in the woods. That day, there was fog, and a company of enemies on one route was already a hundred steps away from them. A burst of gunfire killed seven enemies, and the enemies on both sides came up again. Young Comrade Huaxue covered the retreat for half an hour, and the enemy did not dare to advance. During the most tense period in the county, more than eighty Chiang bandits went to Lilou to seize grain. More than twenty members of the Workers' Team besieged the village and奪 back the grain. As soon as the Workers' Team left the village, the enemy from Lumiao pursued them again. Comrade Huaxue suffered a minor waist injury, but he didn't tell anyone. He secretly tightened his waist and continued to block the enemy at the rear of the team. After the enemy fled, Comrade Huaxue retreated. The enemy concentrated seven brigades of regular troops and local bandit troops to repeatedly "encircle" and "suppress" in southwestern Shandong. They went to every village, and the situation was very tense. There were no hospitals, Captain Cai and Director Hou advised little Huaxue to go to Hebei for recuperation, but little Huaxue firmly refused. Comrade Huaxue still carried his gun and endured the pain, bravely fighting the enemy as usual. On September 2, at the county's model militia meeting, Comrade Huaxue was selected as a first-class hero. The county committee called on the entire county to learn from his spirit of being wounded for the people and not leaving the front line, and his heroic and tenacious spirit in fighting the enemy.
