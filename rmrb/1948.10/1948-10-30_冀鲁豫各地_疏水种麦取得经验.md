Hebei-Shandong-Henan Areas
　　Gained Experience in Draining Water and Planting Wheat
[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Electric] Since the heavy rains in late last month, the flood situation in our region has been severe, especially in the 3rd and 7th districts of Henan. To expand the wheat planting area, all disaster-stricken areas have been rushing to drain water. As of the 10th of this month, according to fragmented reports and statistics from various places, more than 143,000 mu of land have been drained. The following issues have been experienced in the process of draining water in various places: (1) Unified leadership, with cadres taking the lead. Allowing each to drain water independently will inevitably create regional conflicts and delay the time. If necessary, a temporary water management committee can be established. For areas involving two villages, the district leads; for two districts, the county; for two counties, the special commissioner's office... This way, actions are consistent, and water can be discharged quickly. The success of water drainage in Henan and Hebei this time is largely due to this. (2) Pay attention to several ideological issues: Some are busy with war duties and are indifferent to water drainage, failing to seize opportunities and gaps; some district cadres and masses are pessimistic due to the severity of the flood, believing that there is no way out for the water, and do not actively seek solutions, but only wait; some cadres and masses are selfish in the process of water drainage, only willing to discharge water downwards, but unwilling to allow water from above to pass through; some have backward feudal superstitious ideas, such as digging ditches will break "feng shui" or disturb "dead children." The existence of these ideas will hinder the progress of water drainage work to some extent. If they are not patiently persuaded, the work will suffer losses. (3) Solve contradictions realistically, especially historical contradictions. Some are desperately fighting lawsuits for digging breaches and blocking embankments, or old government rulings stipulating that a certain village is not allowed to dig breaches or a certain village is not allowed to block, etc., must be resolved realistically based on the way out of the water. On the one hand, patiently persuade the masses, and on the other hand, earnestly take care of the interests of the masses. If crops are damaged or land is dug, compensation should be made according to the administrative office's instructions based on output. If the temporary drainage or loss is not severe, it can be handled according to the actual situation. (4) In terms of engineering issues, experienced personnel in water drainage, emergency rescue, embankment construction, and levee restoration should be involved as much as possible to prevent waste of manpower, materials, and time. For example, when digging drainage ditches, first find the waterway to determine the route, then measure the dimensions, and determine the width of the canal according to the amount of water. Cadres should check more during digging. For dead depressions that cannot be discharged, long-term transformation can be carried out, with ditches dug around to store water; if the amount of water is not large, ditches can be dug on the side of the ground or road to store water, etc. (5) To permanently eliminate water disasters, we should pay attention to surveying and understanding the river's water flow, siltation, shallow areas, water blockage, area of ​​waterlogged depressions, water depth, outlet, water source, etc., from this water drainage, as a basis for future water management.

　　冀鲁豫各地
  　疏水种麦取得经验
    【冀鲁豫电】自上月底各地下大雨以后，我区水灾严重，尤以河南之三、七分区最重。为扩大种麦面积，各被灾区均突击疏水，至本月十日止，仅据各地片段报导统计，疏水达十四万三千余亩。从各地疏水中体验到如下几个问题：（一）统一领导，干部亲自动手。各顾各的自流疏水，必造成地区的矛盾，迟延时间，必要时可建立临时治水委员会。有关两村的地区，区领导，两区由县，两县由专署……，这样行动一致，水可迅速排出。这次河南河北各地疏水成绩很大，这是一主要原因。（二）注意几个思想问题：有的忙于战勤对疏水麻痹，不能运用机会与空隙；有的因水灾严重，区干群众悲观，以为水无出路，不去主动积极想法，只在等待；还有的干部群众在疏水中存在着本位自私，只愿放水下去，不愿上边水在此通过；有的有落后封建迷信思想，如挖沟要破“风水”或“死小孩”等。这些思想的存在，多少都会障碍疏水工作的进行，如不去耐心说服，工作就要受损失。（三）实事求是的解决矛盾，尤其是历史上的矛盾。有的为扒口堵埝拼命打官司，或过去旧政府定的判决，某村不准扒口某村不准堵等，必须根据水的出路实事求是的解决。一方面向群众耐心说服，另方面要切实照顾群众利益。如毁庄稼，挖土地应按行署指示按产量赔偿。如临时排水或损失不重，可根据实际情况处理。（四）工程问题，应尽量让疏水抢险打埝复堤有经验的人参加，防止浪费民力物力与时间。如挖排水沟，首先找出水路确定路线，再丈量尺度，根据水量去规定渠宽。在挖时干部要多检查，不能放出的死洼，可做长期改造，于四周挖沟存水；如水量不大，可就地边或路上挖沟存水等。（五）为永绝水害，应从这次疏水中注意勘验，了解河道的流水、淤浅、阻水情况、积水洼的面积、水深、出路、水源等，以作今后治水的依据。
