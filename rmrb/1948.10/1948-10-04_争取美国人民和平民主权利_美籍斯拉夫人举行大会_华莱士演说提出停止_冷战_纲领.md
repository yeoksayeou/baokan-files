Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. TASS dispatch: The American Slav Congress, under the slogan of "Striving for the Peaceful and Democratic Rights of the American People," held its Fourth Congress in Chicago from the 24th to the 28th. Prior to the meeting, American reactionaries had slandered the congress as a "sabotage" group, intimidating the congress representatives, and even arresting the congress secretary, Pillinsky, in an attempt to obstruct the congress. However, the number of participating delegates still reached 800. When Pillinsky, after being released on bail, ascended the podium with Congress Chairman Kerzski and Vice Chairman Balakowitz, the entire audience responded with enthusiastic cheers. Kerzski delivered an important speech at the opening session, sternly criticizing the American warmongers and the reactionary Democratic and Republican parties. He analyzed the composition of the Truman government, stating, "Among the 125 senior civil servants appointed by Truman, 49 are bankers and industrial tycoons, 31 are army and navy generals, and 17 are professional politicians." He pointed out that the purpose of a series of anti-democratic measures by the American government is to divert people's attention from the real criminals and real enemies of American democracy—reactionary monopoly capital. The congress unanimously passed a resolution supporting Wallace and Taylor as the Progressive Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates, urging the maintenance of peace and the protection of American civil rights, and also passed a declaration to the Slavic nations, calling for strengthening the unity of the Slavs. The congress elected 75 formal members of the National Committee and 25 alternate members. Kerzski and Pillinsky were re-elected as chairman and secretary, respectively.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. TASS dispatch: American Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace delivered a speech at the "American Slav Congress," proposing his ten-point program for ending the "tense Cold War," strongly advocating that the United States should immediately cease military and financial aid to the corrupt dictatorships in China (Kuomintang), Greece, and Latin America, and cease aid to the Dutch and French colonial empires in Indonesia and Vietnam. Other points in the program included: advocating the convening of a high-level meeting to resolve the German and Japanese peace treaties; all occupying forces on foreign territories should withdraw within a time limit determined by international conferences convened in the occupied countries; peacetime conscription in the United States should be stopped and huge military expenditures should be reduced before negotiations yield results; the United States should reaffirm the constitutional rights and basic principles of democracy; the United States must truly support the plan for the establishment of a unified and democratic Germany based on the basic principles of the Potsdam Agreement; the United States must, together with other United Nations member states, guarantee that German armed forces will never be revived; the United States should support a reasonable German reparations plan; ban atomic weapons; financial assistance to foreign countries should only be used for construction and improvement of the living standards of the people of these countries; and the United Nations should formulate a world reconstruction plan. Wallace asserted that the American regime has been usurped and controlled by a small group of people, who were even friends of fascism before the war. Wallace continued, "Forrestal, Harriman, Lovett, Draper, Dulles, etc., these representatives of large industrial and banking monopoly capitalists, occupy important positions in the government and act perversely." Wallace finally condemned the U.S. government for illegally arresting Pillinsky, secretary of the "American Slav Congress." The speech ended with fifteen minutes of cheers from the audience.
