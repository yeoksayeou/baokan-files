　　Cooperatives Solve the People's Difficulties
  　Smooth Autumn Cultivation in Yanzhuang
    [Taihang News] The Yanzhuang Village Cooperative in the Fifth District of Xiyang helped the masses solve difficulties in paying public funds and buying cloth, ensuring smooth autumn cultivation. After the autumn harvest in the village, the masses were busy with autumn plowing, but the tasks of public funds and buying cotton and cloth for winter clothing arrived simultaneously, and everyone was somewhat worried. If they sold things to pay the fees and make winter clothes, it would affect the autumn cultivation. To solve this problem, the village cooperative consulted with village cadres and the masses and came up with two solutions: (1) The cooperative set appropriate prices to purchase the hemp skins stored by the masses, sell them, and exchange them for cotton cloth and money to supply the needs of the masses. (2) For households without hemp skins, a "buy labor, sell labor" system was implemented. The cooperative and the masses agreed on a labor price, and anyone willing to sell their labor would be hired by the cooperative, with wages paid in advance. Then, during the winter, they would be organized for transportation and other production tasks. After the implementation of these two methods, the difficulty of the masses not having money to pay public funds and make cotton clothes was solved, and autumn cultivation was not delayed. The masses all said that the cooperative was doing a very good job.

　　合作社解决了群众困难
  　阎庄秋耕顺利进行
    【太行讯】昔阳五区阎庄村合作社帮助群众解决交公款与买布等困难，使秋耕顺利进行。该村秋收完成后，群众正忙于秋耕，但公款任务与买棉买布做冬衣问题都同时到来，又要准备参战，大家有些发愁。去变买了东西来交款、做冬衣，就要影响秋耕。村合作社为解决这个困难，便和村干部群众商量出两种办法：（一）合作社规定适当价格将群众所存之麻皮收买来，卖出去，换回棉花布匹和钱来，供给群众需用。（二）没麻皮的户，实行买工卖工。由社里和群众商定工价，群众谁愿卖工，即由社照数买下，先支给群众工钱，到冬季组织运输等生产时出工，这两种办法实行后，群众没钱交公款做棉衣的困难解决了，秋耕也没耽误，群众都说合作社办的很好。
