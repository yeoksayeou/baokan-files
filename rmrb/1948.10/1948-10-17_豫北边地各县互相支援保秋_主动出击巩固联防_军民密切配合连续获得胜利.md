　　[Taihang Telegraph] After universal rectification and the establishment of joint defense organizations in the Yubei border region, the autumn harvest protection struggle in September continued to achieve many victories. According to incomplete statistics from the beginning of the month to the 24th, Wuzhi, Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Anyang, Tangyin, Qi County, Xinxiang, and other places successively supported each other in combat with joint defense, shattering twenty enemy grain-grabbing incursions ranging from dozens to seven or eight hundred men, persisting in the autumn harvest protection front, and defending the masses in their rush to harvest, store, and plant. In this series of victorious joint defense operations, there are the following three characteristics: (1) Not only is there mutual support within a single joint defense, but joint defenses are further implementing mutual large-scale support, the key being to exchange intelligence closely and develop initiative. In repelling two large-scale enemy incursions, Anyang used the method of several joint defenses working together, causing the invading enemy to be attacked from all sides. (2) Joint defense is not only defensive, but also develops the purpose of consolidating joint defense through active attacks. The Jiaozuo puppet security brigade and three puppet township governments moved to the south bank of the Dan River to station themselves, attempting to seize grain on a large scale. The joint defense militia in the nearby Shizhuang District of Xinxiang also took the initiative to go south of the Dan River on the night of the 21st. On a certain day, when our militia attacked the enemy at Maying Bridge, the militia from various places fired their guns together, frightening the enemy in the area into fleeing back to their bandit dens overnight. (3) Local armed forces resolutely support the joint defense armed forces, which is an important part of adhering to and consolidating the joint defense struggle. The Ningguo Joint Defense, jointly organized by Jiaozuo District 1 and Wuzhi District 4, was able to shatter the enemy's three-day grain grabbing plan involving more than 800 men in the shortest possible time on the 21st because of the strong support of our South China Detachment. When the Nanzhouliu and Guxian Joint Defense in Tangyin District 6 struck against an incursion of more than 600 Kuomintang diehards, the county battalion soldiers inserted themselves behind the enemy to ambush them, killing, wounding, and capturing twenty-five enemy soldiers, shattering the Kuomintang bandits' conspiracy to destroy our joint defense armed forces.

　　[Taihang News] Since the end of August, the troops of the Fourth Military Sub-district have taken the initiative to go deep behind enemy lines to protect the masses' autumn harvest and strike at the enemy and puppet forces seizing grain, achieving successive victories in more than a month. On August 26, a part of our Daoqing Detachment raided the enemy's 12th Security Company of Xiuwu Xiaowang Village, which was covering the road construction. After more than ten minutes of fighting, the enemy was completely defeated by us. Due to the influence of our army's correct policy towards prisoners, when our army rushed up and shouted, "Lay down your arms and you will not be killed," the enemy squad leader, Hou Laiyuan, was the first to raise his hands and say, "Don't fight, don't fight, I'll give you the guns!" Other soldiers immediately handed over their guns. One of our platoons captured a machine gun, four rifles, and five enemy soldiers without firing a single shot. In this battle, we captured sixteen enemy soldiers, including the squad leader, and killed one enemy soldier. Our army suffered no casualties. On September 31, a part of our Pinghan Detachment made a long-distance raid on the pseudo-Xunfeng Township Government of Xiuwu. Before dawn, they ambushed outside Xunfeng Village, and when the enemy opened the village gate wide after dawn, our army rushed into the village without firing a shot and completely resolved the pseudo-township government, annihilating an enemy company. We captured fifty-one enemy soldiers alive and killed and wounded more than twenty enemy soldiers. The enemy bandits in the triangle area of Xiu (Wu), Huo (Jia), and Wu (Zhi) were not only extremely panicked at night after our attack, but also dared not move around casually during the day, which boosted the confidence of the masses in protecting the autumn harvest. Then, a part of our ×× Detachment ambushed a small group of reactionary armed forces from the Xin'an Township Government of Jiaozuo En Village, which was plundering grain in our border area on September 10. On the morning of that day, more than 30 people from the Xin'an pseudo-township government invaded Zhangjiantun, Jiaozuo. When the enemy entered our ambush circle, we pounced on them, and the enemy scattered and fled. The battle was resolved in more than ten minutes, killing four enemy soldiers and capturing seven enemy soldiers. We suffered no casualties. On the night of September 17, a part of our ×× Detachment attacked the enemy stronghold in En Village, Nanwuli, Jiaozuo. When the enemy discovered our army, they fled in panic and were annihilated by us. We captured eighteen enemy soldiers. On the evening of the same day, a part of our Pinghan Detachment attacked the Jiaying Township Government of Wuzhi Erpuying. As soon as the battle started, the enemy collapsed and fled. Our army captured six enemy soldiers while pursuing them. Under the continuous attacks of our army, the 318th Regiment of the 40th Division of the Kuomintang regular army stationed in Jiaozuo, combined with the Yang Yijiu unit of the pseudo-prefecture security team, totaling more than 800 people, launched an attack on Ningkuo to seize grain. When the enemy arrived at the entrance of Ningkuo Village, four people were injured by our landmines. At that time, our ×× militia rotation team stationed in the village safely transferred outwards while counterattacking, wounding eight more enemy soldiers. At this time, our ×× Detachment rushed to the scene after hearing the news and killed and wounded seven more enemy soldiers. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy fled in panic. This time, due to the close cooperation between our regular army and the militia and the planned evacuation of the population by the masses, the enemy did not seize a single grain of food. On the same day, more than 100 puppet soldiers from the Pseudo Xin'an Township Government seized grain in the Sanhetun area of Jiaozuo and were also repelled by our Qinhe Detachment. These victories completely foiled the enemy's conspiracy to seize grain during this period. The main reasons why our army was able to achieve the above victories are: 1. Our troops had sufficient ideological and action preparations for protecting the autumn harvest. When the masses entered the autumn harvest, they adopted the method of preemptive strikes, going deep behind enemy lines and attacking their isolated strongholds, causing the enemy's deployment to be chaotic. 2. During the tense autumn harvest, our troops took the initiative to attack completely, so that the enemy in the scattered strongholds had little power to fight back. 3. Our militia armed joint defense can obtain the close support of the regular army, so that the enemy who goes out to seize grain is attacked from both sides, leaving no time to seize grain. Now the Fourth Division is still in the midst of the tense autumn harvest. Our troops are helping the masses transport grain and store it on one hand, and actively attacking the enemy on the other, preparing to achieve greater victories in the second step.

　　豫北边地各县互相支援保秋
  　主动出击巩固联防
  　军民密切配合连续获得胜利
    【太行电】豫北边地经过普遍整顿与建立联防组织后，九月份的保秋斗争续获不少胜利。据上旬至二十四日不完全统计，武陟、焦作、修武、安阳、汤阴、淇县、新乡等地先后以联防相互支援作战，粉碎敌数十人至七八百人的抢粮进犯二十次，坚持了保秋阵地，保卫了群众抢收抢藏抢种。在这一段连获胜利的联防作战中，有以下三个特点：（一）不仅是一个联防内相互支援，而且进一步实行联防与联防相互大支援，关键是互通情报，密切连系，发扬自动性。安阳在击退敌两次大股进犯中，即是运用了数个联防联合作战的方法，使进犯敌四面受袭击。（二）联防不仅是防御，并发扬以主动出击达到巩固联防的目的。获嘉伪保安大队与三个伪乡公所出动至丹河南岸驻札，企图大肆抢粮，邻近该地的新乡师庄区我联防民兵，亦于二十一日夜主动的至丹河以南，某日我民兵袭击马营桥敌时，各地民兵一齐打枪，吓得该地区之敌连夜窜回匪巢。（三）地方武装坚决予联防武装撑腰，这是坚持与巩固联防斗争的重要一环。焦作一区与武陟四区统一组织起来的宁郭联防，在二十一日所以能于最短时间粉碎敌八百余人的三天抢粮计划，即是由于我华南支队的有力支援。汤阴六区南州流与古贤联防在打击蒋顽六百余人的进犯中，该县营兵即插入敌后伏击敌人，毙伤俘敌二十五名，粉碎了蒋匪企图摧垮我联防武装的阴谋。
    【太行讯】四分区部队为了保卫群众秋收，打击抢粮敌伪，自八月底起，主动深入敌后，月余来迭获胜利。八月二十六日，我道清支队一部奇袭修武小王村敌掩护修公路之保安十二中队，经十余分钟战斗，该部敌为我全部击溃。由于我军正确俘虏政策影响，当我军冲上去大喊“缴枪不杀”时，敌分队长侯来元就首先举起双手说：“不打了，不打了，交给你们枪！”其他士兵也立即交了枪。我某排未打一枪，即缴获机枪一挺，步枪四支，俘敌五名，此役共生俘敌分队长以下十六名，毙敌一名。我军无一伤亡。九月三十一日，我平汉支队一部远距离奔袭伪修武郇封乡公所。于拂晓前埋伏于郇封村外，俟敌天明后大开寨门时，我军一枪未打，冲入村内，当将该伪乡公所全部解决，歼敌一个中队。活捉敌五十一名，毙伤敌二十余名。修（武）获（嘉）武（陟）三角地带之敌匪，在我此次打击下，不仅晚上惊慌异常，即在白天也不敢随便出动，使该地群众对保卫秋收，提高信心。接着我××支队一部，又于九月十日伏击向我边地抢粮之焦作恩村辛安乡公所之小股反动武装，当日晨辛安伪乡公所三十余人向我焦作张建屯进犯，待敌进入我伏击圈时，即向敌猛扑，敌不支四散逃命，十余分钟内解决战斗，毙敌四名，俘敌七名。我无一伤亡。九月十七日夜，我××支队一部袭击焦作南五里之恩村敌据点，敌发觉我军后，即仓惶逃窜，被我歼灭一部，俘敌十八名。同日晚，我平汉支队一部，袭击武陟二铺营之贾应乡公所，战斗刚一发起，敌即溃逃，我军在追击时，俘敌六名。在我军接连打击下，驻焦作蒋匪正规军四十师三百一十八团结合伪专署保安队杨义久部八百余人，向我宁廓一带出击抢粮，当敌到达宁廓村口时，被我地雷炸伤四人，当时驻在该村之我××民兵轮战队一面安全向外转移，一面还击，又打伤敌八名。此时我××支队闻讯赶来，又毙伤敌七名，敌见势不妙，即仓惶溃逃。此次由于我正规军与民兵密切配合及群众已有计划的空舍清野，使敌一粒粮食未抢到。同日伪辛安乡公所伪军百余人到我焦作三和屯一带抢粮，亦为我沁河支队击退。这些胜利，使敌人在这个时期的抢粮阴谋完全落了空。而我军能获得以上胜利，主要是由于：一、我部队对保卫秋收已有充分的思想与行动的准备，在群众进入秋收时，即采取先发制敌方法，深入敌后，打其孤立据点，使敌布署混乱。二、在秋收紧张时，我部队又完全采取主动出击，使分散据点之敌很少有还手之力。三、我民兵武装联防能取得正规军之密切支援，使出外抢粮之敌腹背受击，无抢粮余暇。现在四分队仍在紧张秋收，我各部队正在一面帮助群众拉粮与藏粮，一面积极向敌出击，准备取得第二步的更大胜利。
