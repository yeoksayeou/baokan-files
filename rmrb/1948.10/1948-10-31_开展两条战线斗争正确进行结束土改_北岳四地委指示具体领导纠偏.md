　　Launch Two-Front Struggle, Correctly Conclude Land Reform
　　Fourth District Committee of Northern Yue Issues Instructions for Specific Leadership to Rectify Deviations
　　[Northern Yue News] The Fourth District Committee of Northern Yue recently issued instructions to all counties, calling for the correct launch of a two-front struggle to overcome "leftist" and rightist erroneous ideas and practices in concluding land reform and rectifying deviations, in order to achieve the goal of uniting all strata to jointly develop production. The instructions stated: According to reports from Qu, Ling, Fu, Jing and other counties in the recent period, both before and after the communication of the land reform conclusion work to the villages, especially after it reached the villages, some cadres (mostly new cadres) resisted deviation rectification; other cadres (mostly veteran cadres) used rightism to oppose "leftism." The opposition and development of "leftist" and rightist emotions and practices caused many serious disputes between the Party and the masses, and between new and veteran cadres. The "leftist" manifestations are mainly: (1) Some county and district cadres were not affirmative enough or unwilling to be affirmative when communicating the issue of deviation rectification (such as the Third District of Zhengding), and even deliberately distorted the instructions of higher authorities to resist deviation rectification (such as Ping Shan not using 25% of total income as the dividing line between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants when allocating sealed fruit, but still using 15%, which is not only wrong in policy, but also a serious phenomenon of organizational anarchism); (2) Some village cadres one-sidedly emphasized the difficulties of compensation and resettlement, or deliberately delayed the implementation of deviation rectification work under the pretext that the masses could not afford to lose work, and even did not communicate it to the masses (such as Hanjia Yu in the Sixth District of Quyang); (3) Some counties and districts adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards this resistance to deviation rectification by village cadres. Either they thought that there were no deviations to rectify in their area (such as the Fifth District of Zhengding, which said that only six families in the entire district had their class status wrongly determined, but after inspection, in Sanlitu Village alone, six households were actually wrongly determined, where originally only one was believed to be wrong); or they did not actively and proactively help solve the actual difficulties in deviation rectification in some villages, allowing them to be delayed. The ideological root of this "leftist" error is that some district and village cadres still one-sidedly emphasize the interests of poor peasants and farm laborers, and do not deeply recognize the importance of uniting middle peasants and uniting the majority. The result of this "leftist" bias is that a few bad cadres and revenge-seekers seized the opportunity to stir up the dissatisfaction of cadres who were wrongly "moved" and middle peasant households who were wrongly struggled against, and launched a counterattack against the poor peasant leagues and new cadres. For example, in Hanjia Yu, Quyang, a revenge-seeker said to the village cadres who delayed the communication: "You don't hold meetings, but do you think we don't know? The pork we ate must be returned!"

　　The main manifestations of rightism are: (1) A few district cadres one-sidedly emphasized the errors and shortcomings in past work when communicating policies, negating the great achievements of land reform and Party rectification; (2) Some village cadres distorted the original spirit when accepting the policies of higher authorities: for example, after the village chief of Chenjia Zhuang Village in the Fourth District of Quyang returned to the village after attending a meeting in the district, he immediately summoned all the households that had been liquidated to a meeting and promoted everywhere, without any standpoint, that things should be returned to landlords and rich peasants; (3) Some villages did not mobilize and educate the masses to do it themselves when returning things, but adopted a paternalistic and compulsory approach: for example, Wangjia Village in the Ninth District of Jingxing returned more than 20 livestock without going through the masses, which dampened the enthusiasm of the masses; (4) Some Party member cadres who had been struggled against and middle peasant households whose property had been violated went to threaten new cadres in groups to change their class status, return things, satirize, scold, and even beat them. This phenomenon occurred in seven villages including Nanbei Yawo and Xiaokoutou in the Fifth District of Quyang, more than ten villages including Liangtong, Shangshao, and Lujiawa in the Fourth District of Lingshou, and Pingyang in Fuping and Huang'an Village in Xingtang. Some new cadres were worried, afraid, and dared not work anymore, some fled (such as Liu Guijie in Jia Zhuang, Lingshou), and some took back all the distributed fruits from the hands of poor peasants and farm laborers and returned them to the original owners one by one. For example, in Nanyawo Village in the Fifth District of Quyang, they implemented "return whatever grain you ate, return money for the pork you ate, and compensate for what is missing." Individual households who had been struggled against took the opportunity to seize things back from the peasants, such as seizing donkeys in Hujia Zhuang in the Fourth District of Lingshou, and seizing houses in Zhai Li; (5) Some district cadres noticed the above-mentioned serious events but let them go without timely resolution. The root of this rightist error is that some veteran cadres were dissatisfied because they had been raised in class status and their property had been violated, and they had been severely punished in the "moving stones" campaign. Therefore, they stood on a personal standpoint and attempted to seize the deviations and shortcomings in the work to launch a counterattack. As a result, they were extremely interested in deviation rectification. A few district cadres (and even individual county cadres), due to their work history, had personal emotional ties with some veteran village cadres and had more or less unprincipled sympathy for the cadres who were "moved." Therefore, they were particularly interested in the current rectification of "leftist" deviations, and took a laissez-faire attitude when encountering disputes between veteran cadres and new cadres. The result of this rightist bias is that the enthusiasm of poor peasants and farm laborers is low, many good new cadres are beaten down and cannot hold their heads up, and the relationship between new and veteran cadres is further deteriorated.

　　All localities must be highly vigilant against these "leftist" and rightist tendencies and immediately overcome and prevent them. Otherwise, it will not only affect the current land reform completion work, but even cause difficulties for the future comprehensive Party rectification, government building, and production support. Therefore, all localities must seriously deal with illegal acts such as beating people and seizing things within and outside the Party in accordance with discipline and laws. And announce to the masses: Cadres and masses who have been wrongly struggled against and liquidated must wait for district and county cadres to come to the village to resolve the matter, and no more acts of scolding, beating, and forcibly seizing things are allowed. All localities should universally launch a two-front struggle against "leftist" and rightist tendencies in deviation rectification work among county, district, and village cadres, in order to solve problems from the perspective of leadership ideology and from the positive side. To this end, the following specific tasks should be carried out:

　　(1) Seize the current opportunity of the rotational training of village cadres, in addition to conducting in-depth policy education in connection with the actual situation and experience of each region, focus on resolving the "leftist" and rightist erroneous views on the issue of deviation rectification in the training, appropriately carry out ideological struggle, and criticize all erroneous ideological practices that deviate from the policy. District cadres should also participate in this training as much as possible. In particular, individual district cadres who made uncertain or one-sided communications at the village cadres' meeting this time must conduct in-depth self-criticism in the training class to correct the village cadres' policy thinking.

　　(2) Leadership organs at all levels must strengthen their leadership over deviation rectification work, conduct in-depth inspections, and pay attention to possible "leftist" and rightist tendencies at all times; overcome driftism. We must focus on understanding the situation, discovering problems, and specifically helping general cadres solve the difficulties in deviation rectification work.

　　(3) Educate the poor peasant leagues and new cadres to carry out deviation rectification in a timely, proactive, and conscious manner, and oppose deliberately delaying rectification. Although in many villages, most of the fruits have been distributed and there are indeed difficulties in compensation; however, according to the experience of Wujia Yao and Xiaoqie villages in Jingxing, as long as the leadership first explains the responsibility for the past wrong class status determination, the significance of the current compensation, and after ideological brewing inside and outside the Party, and then the poor peasant leagues and new cadres proactively change the class status of the wrongly struggled households, say good things, and take out the existing things and part of the things that can be returned in a negotiating attitude, it is generally possible to satisfy both the poor peasants and farm laborers and the wrongly struggled households. This will prevent bad cadres and a few revenge-seekers from taking advantage of the opportunity. As for a few villages where middle peasants have been seriously violated and a few households must be compensated but cannot be compensated, they should be reported to the higher authorities level by level for resolution by the higher authorities. But no perfunctory or indifferent treatment is allowed. For new cadres who have seriously embezzled and enriched themselves, they should be mobilized to voluntarily return the things. Individual new cadres in Xiapingyang, Fuping, embezzled very seriously. After being discovered by the masses, they did not return the things thoroughly, almost brewing a hanging and beating incident, which should arouse the vigilance of all localities. However, in returning things and compensation, the masses must be mobilized to do it themselves, and paternalism must be opposed. Some places ordered the masses to return all the fruits (such as Nanyawo in Quyang), which seriously dampened the enthusiasm of poor peasants and farm laborers. This kind of behavior of losing the standpoint must be criticized and corrected.

　　Deviation rectification must be serious, but it does not mean that all the things that the violated households have taken out or distributed must be returned in order to be called "serious." This approach will not only fail to strengthen unity, but will create more serious opposition among the peasants. Serious deviation rectification is to carry out appropriate compensation separately for specific situations and specific objects; this requires more persuasion and explanation work to open up the minds of both parties, so that they can negotiate well and achieve a general satisfaction on both sides.

　　Editor's Note: The work of concluding land reform and continuing Party rectification has officially begun in the entire region. In order to carry out this work correctly, the Fourth District Committee of Northern Yue emphasized launching a two-front struggle to overcome "leftist" and rightist errors, which is correct. Judging from the materials of various districts in the past year, the errors cited in the instructions of the Fourth District Committee of Northern Yue are not individual phenomena, but have occurred and continue to develop universally in various localities. These errors not only directly affect the completion of the land reform conclusion and Party rectification work, but will also cause disunity among peasants, between the Party and the masses, and even within cadres, causing endless harm. It is hoped that all localities will deeply summarize and accept this experience and lesson, formulate specific measures according to different situations, thoroughly eliminate various incorrect tendencies of using rightism to correct "leftism" or resisting rectification with "leftism" to oppose rightism, so that they will not repeat the same mistakes.

　　开展两条战线斗争正确进行结束土改
  　北岳四地委指示具体领导纠偏
    【北岳讯】北岳四地委顷向各县发出指示，号召正确开展两条战线斗争，克服结束土改与纠偏中的“左”右倾错误思想与做法，以达团结各阶层共同发展生产的目的。指示略称：据曲、灵、阜、井等各县近一时期的汇报中反映：在土改结束工作传达到村的前后，特别是传达到村之后，一部分干部（新干居多）抵抗纠偏；另一部分干部（老干居多）则以右反“左”。“左”与右两种情绪与两种作法的对立与发展，在党群之间、新老干部之间造成许多严重的纠纷。“左”的表现主要是：（一）有些县区干部在传达纠偏问题时就不够肯定不愿肯定（如正定三区），甚至故意歪曲上级指示，抵抗纠偏（如平山不按照剥削分量占其总收入百分之廿五为富农与富裕中农的分界线，在分配封存的果实时，仍按百分之十五为富农与富裕中农的分界线，这不仅在政策上是错误的，而且在组织上也是严重的无组织无政府现象）；（二）部分村干部片面强调补偿安置的困难，或借口群众误不起工，对纠偏工作故意拖延不执行，甚至不向群众传达（如曲阳六区韩家峪）；（三）有些县区对村干部这种抵抗纠偏的行为，采取了放任的态度。或者以为自己的地区无偏可纠（如正定五区说，全区划错了成份的只有六家，但经检查后，仅三里屯一村，过去认为是错了一户的，实际就错了六户）；或则对某些村在纠偏中实际存在的困难问题，不去积极主动的帮助解决，任其拖延。这种“左”倾错误的思想根源，是一部分区村干部仍然片面强调贫雇农利益，没有深刻认识到团结中农、团结多数的重要性。这种“左”倾偏向的结果，是使少数坏干部与报复分子抓住空子，把错“搬”了的干部与错斗了的中农户之不满情绪鼓动起来，向贫农团与新干部反攻。如曲阳韩家峪报复分子向拖延不作传达的村干部说：“你们不开会，莫非我们就不知道吗？吃了的猪肉一定要退！”
    右的主要表现是：（一）少数区干部在传达政策时，片面强调过去工作中的错误与缺点，否定土改整党的伟大成绩；（二）一部分村干部在接受上级政策时歪曲了原来的精神：如曲阳四区陈家庄村长到区开会回村后，马上召集所有被清算户开会，毫无立场的到处宣传给地富退东西；（三）有些村在退东西时，没有发动与教育群众自己来做，而采取了包办代替与强迫命令：如井陉九区王家村未通过群众，即退了二十来个牲口，给群众泼了冷水；（四）有些村被斗过的党员干部与被侵犯的中农户成群结队去威胁新干部改成份，退东西，讽刺谩骂，甚至殴打。曲阳五区南北雅握、小口头等七个村庄，灵寿四区良同、上邵、卢家洼等十余村，阜平的平阳、行唐的黄安村，均发生此种现象。新干部有的发愁，害怕，不敢再做工作，有的逃跑（如灵寿贾庄的刘贵姐），有的从贫雇农手里收回所有已分配的果实，一一退还原主。如曲阳五区南雅握村实行“吃了什么粮，还退什么粮，吃了猪肉退钱，短了的东西赔偿。”个别被斗户即乘机从农民手里夺回东西，如灵寿四区胡家庄的夺驴，宅里的夺房子等；（五）的有区干部发觉上述严重事件，听之任之，不去及时解决。这种右倾错误的根源是：一部分老干部由于自己曾被提高成份，侵犯财产，在“搬石头”中受到较重的处分，心怀不满，于是站在个人立场上，企图抓住工作中的偏向缺点，进行反攻，因而只对纠偏发生极大兴趣，有少数区干部（甚至个别县干部）由于工作历史的原因，和某些老村干存在着私人感情联系，对被“搬”的干部或多或少抱着无原则的同情心，因而对目前纠正左倾一事也特别发生兴趣，遇到老干部报复新干部的纠纷时，也就采取了放纵的态度。这种右倾偏向的结果是：贫雇农情绪低落，许多好的新干部被打击得抬不起头，以致新老干部关系更加恶化。
    对于这种“左”的与右的倾向，各地都必须提起高度警惕，立即加以克服与防止。否则不但要影响目前的土改结束工作，甚至会给将来的全面整党、建政与生产支前造成困难。因此，对上述的打人、夺东西等非法行为，各地必须在党内党外按纪律与法令认真处理。并向群众宣布：凡斗争清算错了的干部与群众，此后必须等候区县干部到村解决，再不允许有谩骂、殴打及强夺东西等行为。各地要在县区村干部当中普遍开展纠偏工作上的反“左”右倾的两条战线斗争，以便从领导思想上，从积极方面解决问题。为此应进行以下几项具体工作：
    （一）抓紧目下村干部正在轮训的时机，除联系各自地区的实际情况与经验，深入进行政策教育外，同时要在训练中着重解决在纠偏问题上的“左”与右的错误观点，要适当开展思想斗争，批判一切离开政策的错误思想作法。区干部也应尽量参加这一训练。特别是这次在村干部会议上作了不肯定或片面传达的个别区干部，尤须在训练班中进行深入的自我检讨，以端正村干部的政策思想。
    （二）各级领导机关必须加强对纠偏工作的领导，深入检查，时刻注意可能发生的“左”右倾向；克服自流主义。必须有重点的了解情况，发现问题，具体帮助一般干部解决纠偏工作中的困难。
    （三）教育贫农团与新干部及时主动的自觉的进行纠偏，反对故意拖延不纠。虽然有不少村庄果实已大部分配，补偿中确有困难；但根据井陉吴家窑、小切等村经验，只要领导上首先说明过去划错成份的责任，现在补偿的意义、经过党内外的思想酝酿，再由贫农团、新干部主动的给错斗户改成份，说好话，以协商态度把现有的东西和可能退的一部分东西拿出来，进行补偿，一般是能够做到让贫雇农与错斗户双方满意的。这样就使坏干部与少数报复分子无机可乘。至于少数村庄侵犯中农很严重，少数户必须补偿而又确实无法补偿者，则应逐级上报，由上级设法解决。但决不允许敷衍马虎，置之不理。对于新干部中贪污自肥比较严重的，要动员他们主动退出东西。阜平下平阳个别新干部贪污很严重，被群众发觉后，退东西又不彻底，几乎酝酿成吊打事件，应引起各地警惕。但在退东西与补偿中，必须动员群众自己来做，反对包办。有的地方命令群众把果实全部退出来（如曲阳南雅握），严重打击了贫雇农情绪，对这种丧失立场的行为，必须批评纠正。
    纠偏必须认真，但并不是说必须把被侵犯户已拿出或分用的东西全部退出才叫做“认真”，这种做法不仅不能加强团结，反而会在农民之间造成更严重的对立。认真纠偏，是要针对具体情况，具体对象，分别进行适当补偿；这就需要多做说服解释工作，打通双方思想，使之很好协商，做到双方大体上满意。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：结束土改与继续整党的工作，在全区已经正式开始。为使这一工作正确进行，北岳四地委强调开展两条战线的斗争，克服“左”右倾错误，是正确的。从一年来各区材料看，北岳四地委指示中所举的错误并非个别现象，而是各地都已普遍发生且继续在发展中。这些错误不仅直接影响结束土改与整党工作的完成，并将造成农民相互间、党与群众间以至干部内部的不团结，贻害无穷。希望各地都深刻总结与接受这一经验教训，根据不同情况订出具体办法，彻底肃清以右纠“左”或抵抗纠偏以“左”反右的各种不正确倾向，使不再蹈覆辙。
