Relying on Worker Activists to Inspire Employee Enthusiasm
　　Andong Paper Mill Completes Huge Reconstruction Project

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th】The famous Andong Paper Mill, after fourteen months of arduous effort, was fully restored to production in early August this year. During the reconstruction, many departments completed their tasks ahead of schedule, saving more than 10,000 man-days compared to the original plan. The total value of materials saved by utilizing waste products reached 600 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below). The factory suffered damage from both the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang bandit troops. Of the 26,000+ square meters of building and equipment, only three 100-meter-high steel and concrete medicine towers remained. The original seven-story wooden digester building was reduced to a single two-story wall, and only the foundations of the wood chipping room remained. Ninety-nine percent of the factory's buildings needed to be rebuilt, while only one percent could be used after repairs. Twenty-five percent of the machinery had to be completely rebuilt, and sixty-four percent required partial repairs. Such serious difficulties initially made many technicians and workers lack confidence in restoring production, but under the firm direction and correct plans of the factory's leadership, relying on the activists among the workers, gradually mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees, this arduous project was finally completed. Over the past fourteen months, the factory's employees have successively completed important buildings such as the wooden digester building, wood chipping room, washing room, wooden digester room, selection room, bleaching room, medicine preparation room, wood grinding room, and paper forming room; and repaired 545 various machines, including ten paper machines with a paper forming width of 718 inches, eleven cooking pots capable of producing 23.5 tons of pulp, and twelve boilers capable of burning 480,000 pounds of pressure.
　　
　　When rebuilding the seven-story wooden digester building, the largest building in the factory, a large amount of bricks, stones, wood, cement, etc., was needed, and it had to be completed within a month before the freezing season. The workers not only used all their strength to work, but also mobilized their families to participate in the collection and transportation, which solved the difficulty of insufficient materials, and completed the project six days ahead of schedule, saving nearly 3,000 man-days. Seventeen workers braved the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius to transport two burnout-type boilers weighing more than 10,000 pounds each, completing the task on schedule and saving more than 170 man-days. All 40+ workers in the iron workshop repaired, cast, and installed 95 machines in all eleven workshops in the factory, utilizing nearly 2,000 pieces of waste products, saving more than 440 million yuan. The waste products utilized by the pipe workshop were equal to one-third of the total number of pipes needed. There were more than 20 important technical creations and improvements in the production process after the resumption of work. For example, after the workers researched and modified the burnout-type boiler, it can save 10,000 catties of coal per day. Caustic soda, the main chemical for papermaking, was replaced with lime after workers' research, saving nearly 2 billion yuan in ten months. The wooden digester room originally required 37 hours to steam a pot of material, but now it has been reduced to 13 hours. The selection room now selects 1,000 catties more material per pot than in the past. The working efficiency of the mixing room in grinding a pool of material has increased fivefold compared to the past.

　　In mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, the factory's leadership carried out the following tasks: First, promoting democracy, handing over each specific task directly to each group, discussing and formulating plans by the workers, reviewing them once a week, giving play to the enthusiasm of each person, and cadres and technicians taking charge of several groups to understand the situation, check the implementation of tasks, and report regularly. The second was to carry out a meritorious service campaign to stimulate the workers' labor enthusiasm, establish a correct labor attitude, and cultivate activists. At the same time, training classes, night schools, etc. were held to carry out political and current affairs education. The third was to establish a reasonable wage system, and carefully conduct a bottom-up wage evaluation movement based on technical level, which greatly improved the workers' enthusiasm for studying technology. Fourth, establish hospitals, bathhouses, implement interest-free grain loans, relief grain, etc., to solve workers' living difficulties.

　　To celebrate the complete completion of the reconstruction project and reward a large number of meritorious workers in the reconstruction, the factory held a grand celebration meeting on September 24. Those who received awards accounted for more than 80% of the factory's workers, and 86 units achieved collective merits. The meritorious workers included ironworkers, carpenters, bricklayers, scaffolders, pipefitters, sawyers, carriers, etc. Fifty-five people in the administrative departments, such as accounting, warehouse, and engineering, also achieved merits.

　　依靠工人积极分子激发职工劳动热情
  　安东造纸厂完成巨大复工工程
    【新华社东北十九日电】著名的安东造纸厂，经过十四个月的艰巨努力，已于今年八月初完全复工。修建中，许多部门均提前完成任务，较预定计划节省了一万多个人工。利用废品所节约物资的总值达六十万万元（东北币，下同）。该厂先后遭受日伪及国民党匪军的破坏，在二万六千余平方公尺的建筑设备上只剩三个百公尺高的钢骨水泥制药塔。原来七层高的木釜大楼只剩下两层高的一面墙，削木室只剩了地基。全厂需重建的建筑物达百分之九十九，而只需加以修理便可使用的仅占百分之一。机器有百分之廿五必须全部新建，有百分之六十四亦需要局部修理。这样严重的困难，曾使很多技师和工人在开始时没有复工的信心，但在该厂领导机关坚定的方针与正确的计划之下，依靠工人中的积极分子，逐步发动全体职工的积极性与创造性，终于完成了这一艰巨的工程。十四个月来，该厂员工先后完成了木釜大楼、削木室、洗涤室、木釜室、精选室、涤漂室、制药室、碎木室、抄取室等重要建筑；修复了各种机器五百四十五台，其中包括抄纸度达七百十八英寸的抄纸机十台，能出二十三吨半纸料子的蒸煮锅十一台，能烧四十八万磅气压的锅炉十二台。
    当重建全厂最大建筑的七层木釜大楼时，需用大量砖石、木材、洋灰等，而且须于一个月内冰冻之前完成，工人们不但用自己的全力来工作，而且发动他们的家属参加搜集与运输，才解决了材料不足的困难，并提前六日完工，省工近三千人。有十七个工人曾冒零下二十度严寒，搬运两台万余斤重的烧心式锅炉，按期完成任务，节省了人工一百七十余个。铁工室全体四十多工人，修复、铸造与装置了全厂十一个工作室的九十五台机器，利用了废品近二千件，节约四亿四千余万元。管子室利用的废品等于全部需用管子数的三分之一，技术上的创造、改进在复工后的生产过程中，较重要的有二十余种之多，如烧心式锅炉经工人研究改置后，每天可节省煤炭一万斤。造纸主要药品的火碱，经工人研究出以石灰代替，十个月中节省近二十亿元。木釜室蒸一锅料子原需三十七小时，现减至十三小时，精选室选一锅料子现在比过去增加了一千斤。调成室磨一池料子，工作效率比过去提高了五倍。
    在发动工人的积极性与创造性方面，该厂领导机关进行了以下的工作：第一是发扬民主，将每一具体任务直接交给各小组，由工人讨论并订出计划，每周检讨一次，发挥了每个人的积极性，干部与技师分头掌握几个小组，了解情况，检查任务的执行，并定期汇报。第二则是开展立功运动，激发工人的劳动热情，树立正确的劳动态度，培养了积极分子。同时并举办训练班、夜校等，进行政治与时事等教育工作。第三是确立合理的工资制度，根据技术等级，慎重进行了自下而上的评资运动，大大提高了工人钻研技术的情绪。第四，建立医院、澡堂，实行无利贷粮，救济粮等，解决工人生活困难。
    为庆祝全部完成复工工程及奖励复工中大批立功者，该厂于九月二十四日隆重举行庆功大会，受奖者占全厂工人百分之八十以上，立集体功者达八十六个单位，立功者包括铁工、木工、瓦工、架工、管子工、锯工、抬工等。事务部门之会计、仓库、工务等单位亦有五十五名立功。
