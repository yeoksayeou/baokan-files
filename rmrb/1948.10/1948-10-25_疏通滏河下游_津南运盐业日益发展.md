　　【Jizhong Telegram】Under the support of the democratic government, the salt transport industry in southern Tianjin is developing rapidly. More than 60 villages east of Wuzhuangzi along the Fuhe River in this county suffered from floods every year. This spring, the democratic government allocated more than 390,000 catties of grain to provide work relief, widening the lower reaches of the Fuhe River from Wangjiazhuang to Qikou Haihe for 61 miles, making the river unblocked. In June, the North China Salt Industry Company branch lent funds to support the salt transport industry in the Fuhe River area. For example, Zhou Qingzhuang originally had 17 pairs of large groove boats that were often not used for transportation. After the branch provided loans and support, they added three pairs of large grooves and five small boats to transport salt from salt flats such as Weiwa Dongsigang, Li Erwan, and Ximapeng Kouzi to Jiedi and Kaikou, a total of 130 miles. The freight for one catty of salt was 40 yuan. A pair of large groove boats could load an average of 20,000 catties of salt, earning 800,000 yuan. They transported at least three trips per month, and 20 pairs of large groove boats transported six trips, earning a total of 56 million yuan, which could buy 400,000 catties of corn. Dou Shiqin and other eleven small boats in Douzhuangzi, each loading 5,000 catties of salt, borrowed 500,000 yuan from the salt company branch and earned 8.6 million yuan after three trips. Villages have been adding boats. For example, Liu Sanzhuang and Wagu added four pairs of large grooves, and Xia Sanbao added a large boat and a pair of large groove boats. Jiedi has more than 30 boats for salt transport, including both old and newly added boats. Qikou also has 14 boats entering the Fuhe River to load and transport salt. Boatman Lü Junyi said, "Without the government dredging the river, we would never have these boats, and sea boats would not be able to enter." The flood-stricken villages along the Fuhe River have also added many small boats, which has solved part of the livelihood problems of the disaster victims. After the democratic government repaired and dredged the lower reaches of the Fuhe River, it not only developed salt transport, but also reduced floods along the river, and 50 hectares of barren alkaline land along the river turned into fertile fields.

　　疏通滏河下游
  　津南运盐业日益发展
    【冀中电】津南运盐业在民主政府扶植下日益发展。该县滏河沿河吴庄子以东六十余村，年年遭受水灾。今春民主政府拨粮三十九万余斤，以工代赈，把王吉庄到岐口海河六十一里的滏河下游挖宽，使河内疏通。六月间华北盐业公司分店又在滏河一带贷款扶植运盐业。如周清庄原有十七对大槽船，经常不运输，经分店贷款扶植后，又添了三对大槽和五只小船，从苇洼东四港、李二湾、西马棚口子等盐摊上运盐到捷地、开口，共一百三十里，一斤盐运费四十元，一对大槽船平均装盐二万斤，就赚八十万元；每月至少运三趟，二十对大槽船运六趟，共赚五千六百万元，能买四十万斤玉米。窦庄子窦士勤等十一只小船，每只装五千斤盐，在盐业公司分店贷了五十万元后，运了三趟，赚八百六十万元。各村纷纷添购船只，如刘三庄、瓦古＠便新增了四对大槽子，下三堡新增一只大船和一对大槽船。捷地连旧有及新增船只共三十多只运盐，岐口也有十四只船进滏河装盐运。船民吕俊义说：“政府不挖河，一辈子没有这些船，海船也进不来。”沿滏河的水灾村，添小船也不少，灾民的生活解决了一部分。民主政府修挖滏河下游以后，不但发展了盐业运输，沿河的水灾也减少了，沿河五十顷荒碱地变成了良田。
