　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 3rd: In the Jinan Campaign, to closely link with military command and give play to the unified and centralized leadership role of wartime political work, a certain column of the East China People's Liberation Army specially established a frontline political work command post. Its mission was to understand and study the frontline situation, exchange experiences, correct deviations, publish newspapers, transmit victory news from fraternal units, and promptly guide the activities of frontline political work. The political work command post was located near the military command post, and issued instructions at any time according to military intentions and changing circumstances. The political work command post relied on company inspection teams and frontline reporters to carry out its work.
