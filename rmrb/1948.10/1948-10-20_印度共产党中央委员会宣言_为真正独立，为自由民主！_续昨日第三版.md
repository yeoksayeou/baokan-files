　　Declaration of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India
  　For True Independence, For Freedom and Democracy!
  　Continued from yesterday's third edition
  　The Future of the Situation in India
    The policies adopted by the "National Government" in cooperation with Anglo-American imperialism have not resolved the crisis, but have instead intensified it. The purchasing power of the people is rapidly declining, and inflation and rising prices cannot be contained. The working class faces a continuous decline in real wages and massive layoffs. Agricultural panic surrounds the entire country. Famine has become chronic, and the pauperization of the peasant masses is becoming increasingly severe. Goods are accumulated in the hands of monopoly capitalists and merchants, and land is concentrated in the hands of landlords. Due to inflation, high prices, black markets, and layoffs, middle-class laborers are being massively pauperized.
    Due to the current price levels and the profit motives of capitalists, the market is rapidly reaching a saturation point, where the illusion of too few goods is about to shatter, and the crisis is about to truly expose itself as a crisis of overproduction, because the pauperized working people cannot even afford the existing goods.
    The Indian bourgeoisie and its representatives, the National Congress Party leaders who control the so-called National Government, are desperately trying to maintain their profits by shifting the burden of the crisis onto the shoulders of the working people. They are attempting to maintain existing land relations and feudal exploitation, attacking wage standards, forcing longer working hours, demanding higher prices for goods or the abolition of controls, opposing the nationalization of large enterprises for the sake of obtaining unregulated profits, carrying out massive layoffs, using "rationalization" to intensify work, attacking trade unions, peasant organizations, and democratic freedoms, and ruthlessly suppressing workers and peasants.
    In order to save their profits from the rapidly growing crisis and the collapse of the Indian market, they are seeking scraps of export trade from the colonial markets dominated by Anglo-American imperialism, engaging in capital transactions with them to jointly exploit India, courting relations with the British Empire's affiliated countries, preparing to cooperate with imperialism in battles for expansion, and ensuring the suppression of labor and democratic struggles in India, thus selling the country to the imperialists.
    But this policy itself is further impoverishing the people, further lowering the purchasing power of the masses, and can only further aggravate the crisis and accelerate the demise of all reactionaries.
    This is why, even though the reactionaries have launched an offensive of national discrimination, governments at all levels and national leaders have implemented sabotage and ruthless suppression, the masses still harbor great illusions about the national leaders, and the post-war mass upsurge continues unabated. The wave of worker strikes reached unprecedented heights last year, the struggles in peasant areas are advancing steadily, government employees and middle-class employees are seething with discontent, and student masses have stepped forward into heroic struggles.
    Regardless of the betrayal by the national leadership and the right-wing leaders in the people's movements in various princely states, regardless of their betrayal of the freedom of the people of various princely states for the sake of the bourgeoisie's profit-seeking, and their despicable compromise with the princes, the people of various princely states have been bravely fighting to end feudal autocratic rule.
    In Hyderabad (the largest princely state in India - translator), the people have already begun to resist the armed forces of the local king with captured weapons, distributing the land of landlords to those who till it, guaranteeing increased wages for farm laborers, and making the Nizam's rule virtually non-existent in thousands of villages.
    The awakening and rise of the people are progressing rapidly. They are increasingly demanding the establishment of true democracy, people's democracy, and a state that embodies people's democracy.
    The alliance of the working class and laboring peasants, as well as other parts of the petty bourgeoisie, is capable of fighting alone to win such democracy and to resolve the crisis in the people's way. Confiscation of foreign capital, nationalization of all important and basic industries, drastic improvement of the living standards of workers, and uncompensated abolition of all forms of landlordism, land to the tillers—these are the basic goals of the people's democratic revolution.
    The basic condition for such a democratic solution to the crisis is the establishment of a people's republic, based on the hegemony of the working class and the direct rule of the laboring people.
    All reformist illusions about the "National Government" and the National Congress Party leadership must be dispelled, and a new democratic front must be established with the working class as its leader, to fight for a democratic republic and to solve the crisis in the people's way.
    The Democratic Front
    The democratic front must be built through the struggle of the common people against exploitation and oppression. It must be based on the alliance of workers, laboring peasants, and other exploited members of the petty bourgeoisie. It should be built into a mass organization, moving towards a disciplined and solidly united mass political organization of the entire laboring people. The unity of left-wing forces must be achieved through the common struggle for the success of the democratic front. In order to achieve left-wing unity, it is necessary not only to expose the bourgeois leaders in power but also to expose the bourgeois leaders of various left-wing parties, revealing their true colors to the masses.
    For example, the policies of the leadership of the Socialist Party deceive the masses with socialist platitudes and anti-communist and anti-Soviet slanders. The leadership of that party and other similar leaderships among left-wing parties nominally advocate moving to the left but in reality play the role of a bourgeois parliamentary opposition, diverting the political consciousness of the militant masses onto an anti-communist and destructive path. They undermine the unity of the laboring people, thus rescuing the positions of the reactionary forces.
    Democratic Program
    The program of the democratic front should include the following sections:
    (1) Complete severance of relations with the British Empire, full and genuine independence.
    (2) Establishment of a democratic government representing workers, peasants, and other parts of the petty bourgeoisie, opposing cooperation with imperialism, and uniting with democratic countries to fight for peace and freedom for all nations.
    (3) Formulation of a constitution based on universal suffrage for adults and proportional representation, guaranteeing full freedom and democracy for the common people, and guaranteeing basic economic rights.
    (4) All nations have the right to self-determination, including the right to secede. The Indian Federation should be a voluntary association, and the provinces should be autonomous and divided by language.
    (5) The constitution should stipulate fair and democratic rights for ethnic minorities, protect the equality of ethnic minorities, and protect their languages and cultures. All compulsory obligations, privileges, and differential treatment based on hereditary class, race, and ethnicity must be abolished by law, and violators should be punished by law.
    (6) Abolition of princely and feudal rule and establishment of full democracy in the princely states of India. Regarding the question of which country the princely states should join, the policies of the governments of India and Pakistan should be exposed. They portray a princely state's participation in the Indian Federation or Pakistan as a great victory. It should be explained to the common people that the urgent and primary task within each princely state is to abolish princely and feudal rule and establish a people's democratic state. Before this, merger only subjects the people of the princely states to the princely autocracy and the bourgeois rulers of the Indian Federation. Only after the people of the princely states are completely free can they have genuine freedom to decide their relationship with the rest of India. At that stage, this question will be decided by the wishes of the people.
    (7) All tribes and other backward nationalities should have freedom from economic, cultural, and political oppression. Full democratic rights should be extended to them, and the state should provide them with timely and adequate assistance for their development so that they can quickly catch up with the advanced nations. All nationalities in closely connected, primarily tribal areas should have local autonomy. They can establish autonomous regions within the provinces, enjoying full power over general administration within the region, especially over political and cultural affairs directly related to the region. Nationalities in such areas or provinces in appropriate regions may also form one or more separate provinces. The people in these regions or provinces should have the right to secede from the country through a democratic referendum.
    (8) The Indian Federation and Pakistan should cooperate to form military and political alliances for economic assistance and national defense, and adopt a democratic foreign policy to cooperate with democratic countries against the Anglo-American bloc.
    (9) Abolish all forms of landlordism without compensation and distribute the land to the tillers. The abolition of landlordism must confiscate the "khas" land of non-cultivating landowners and ensure that small and large tenants actually obtain land. Rural debts must be cancelled and usury abolished; rural workers should have wages sufficient to live on.
    (10) The state should confiscate the interests of foreign capital in banks, industrial and transportation companies, plantations, and mines, and nationalize these enterprises.
    (11) Nationalize large industries, large banks, and insurance companies, guaranteeing workers' management rights, minimum wages, and an eight-hour working day, etc.
    (12) Formulate economic plans to develop Indian resources and drive out the big capitalists from strategic economic strongholds. Regulate the profits of industries in private hands.
    (13) Abolish all oppressive laws.
    (14) Eliminate the state apparatus of bureaucratic administration and establish a democratic administrative apparatus, with officials elected by the people and guided by people's committees.
    (15) Universally arm the people and establish a democratic army.
    (16) The people should have the right to free education and compulsory primary education.
    (17) Women should have equal democratic rights.
    Among the workers, peasants, and other oppressed sections of the Indian people, the response to and understanding of the democratic movement's main slogans has never been as deep and widespread as it is today: abolish landlordism, land to the tillers; abolish princely autocracy; nationalize key industries, wages that can sustain life; democratic freedoms, etc.
    The economic crisis is activating very large forces. The workers are fighting with the highest courage and indomitable perseverance, and the situation is moving towards a general offensive by the working class. On the agricultural front, the peasants are also entering a preliminary high tide, defeating the suppressors, and repeatedly moving towards the offensive.
    It is the task of the Party to lead all the struggles of the working class, to unite and guide them as part of the struggle for the democratic front program, and to fight for the realization of the basic demands of the working class.
    The Communist Party, by leading and guiding these struggles towards this goal, by standing out as the most courageous enemy of imperialism, and as the most courageous enemy of the reactionary bourgeois national leadership and its lackeys, can accelerate the process of the people's awakening and can firmly establish the hegemony of the proletariat, which is the only guarantee of the success of the people's democratic struggle.
    In the current period of world crisis, the task of advancing the democratic movement is the responsibility of the working class and its party—the Communist Party. Therefore, the laboring people and their true friends should strengthen and expand the Communist Party, a conscious party member, a party trained in Marxism-Leninism and deeply rooted in the laboring people—this is our motto.

　　印度共产党中央委员会宣言
  　为真正独立，为自由民主！
  　续昨日第三版
  　印度局势的前途
    “国民政府”所采取的和英美帝国主义合作的政策，并未解决，反而加强了危机。人民的购买力正在迅速低落，通货膨胀和物价增高无法抑止。工人阶级，面对着实际工资的不断下降以及大量裁员。农业恐慌包围了整个国家。灾荒变成了痼疾，农民大众的赤贫化，日益剧烈。商品积聚在独占资本家和商人们的手里，土地集中在地主们的手里。由于通货膨胀，物价高涨，黑市和裁员，中产阶级劳动者正在大量地赤贫化。
    由于现有的物价水准和资本家的利润动机，市场正在迅速达到一个饱和点，即货物太少的幻影即将破碎，而危机即将真正暴露为一个生产过剩的危机，因为赤贫化了的劳动人民，甚至连现有的货物都买不起。
    印度资产阶级及其代表，即控制着所谓国民政府的国民大会党领导者们，正在把危机的重担转移到劳动人民的肩上，这样来拼命设法维持他们的利润。他们正在企图维持现有的土地关系和封建剥削，攻击工资标准，强迫延长工作时间，要求货物的较高价格或取消统制，为了获得没有管制的利润而反对大企业国有化，大量裁员，用“合理化”来加重工作，进攻职工会、农民团体及民主自由，无情地压迫工农。
    为了从迅速生长的危机和印度市场的崩溃中挽救自己的利润，他们正在从英美帝国主义所霸占的殖民地市场中找取出口贸易的残屑，正在和他们作资本交易可共同剥削印度，正在拉拢英帝国主义各属国的关系，正在准备和帝国主义为了扩张的战斗合作，正在保证在印度压制劳工和民主的斗争，这样来把国家卖给帝国主义者们。
    可是这个政策本身，使赤贫化更进一步，使群众的购买力更为低落，只能进一步的加重危机，加速一切反动派末日的到来。
    这就是纵然反动派发动了民族歧视的攻势，各级政府和民族领袖们实施了破坏和无情镇压，群众依然对民族领袖们抱有很大的幻想，而战后群众高潮依然前进而未见减退的缘故。工人罢工的浪潮去年达到了空前未有的高度，农民区域的战斗着着前进，政府公务员和中产阶级雇员是沸腾着不满的一群，学生群众已向前走入英勇的斗争。
    不管民族领导机构和各土邦人民运动中的右翼领袖们的出卖，不管他们为了资产阶级的获取利润而出卖掉各土邦人民的自由，卑劣地和王公们取得妥协，各土邦人民为了结束封建专制统治，一直在英勇地作战。
    在海德拉巴特邦（印度最大的土邦——译者）人民已经用俘获得来的武装，开始抵抗土王的武装力量，把地主的土地分给耕地的人们，保证雇农增加工资，并且使尼萨姆的统治在几千个村庄里实际上不存在。
    人民的苏醒和奋起正在迅速进步中。他们正在愈来愈要求建立真正的民主，人民的民主以及一个体现人民民主的国家。
    工人阶级和劳动农民以及小资产阶级的其他部分联盟起来，是能够单独作战，争取这样的民主，并争取以人民的办法来解决危机的。没收外国资本，将一切重要和基本工业实行国有化，激烈地改善工人的生活程度，无补偿地取消一切形式的地主制度，耕者有其田——这些就是人民的民主革命的基本目标。
    这样民主地解决危机的办法，其基本条件是建立一个人民共和国，以工人阶级的盟主权以及劳动人民的直接统治为基础。
    必须清除关于“国民政府”和国民大会党领导机构的一切改良主义的幻想，必须以工人阶级为盟主，建立一个新的民主阵线，为了争取民主共和国和用人民的办法来解决危机而战斗。
    民主阵线
    民主阵线必须通过平民反对剥削和压迫的斗争而建立起来。它必须以工人、劳动农民和其他被剥削的中产阶级的同盟为基础。它应建立成为一个群众性的团体，朝着整个劳动人民的有纪律和坚固地团结的群众政治组织的方向走。必须通过为了民主阵线的成功的共同斗争，而获得左翼各力量的团结。为了达到左翼团结，不仅必须暴露当权的资产阶级领导者，也必须暴露各左翼政党的资产阶级领导者，把他们的真面目揭露给群众。
    例如，社会党的领导机构的政策，用社会主义的滥调和反共反苏的谰言来欺骗群众。该党领导机构和左翼党派中与此相似的其他领导机构，在名义上主张向左，但在实际上起着资产阶级议会反对党的作用，把具有战斗性的群众的政治意识，移转到反共和破坏性的路上去。他们破坏劳动人民的团结，这样来援救反动力量的阵地。
    民主纲领
    民主阵线的纲领，应包括如下各节：
    （一）完全和英帝国断绝关系，充分和真正独立。
    （二）成立一个代表工人、农民和小资产阶级其他部分的民主政府，反对和帝国主义合作，而联合争取各国和平与自由的各民主国家。
    （三）以成人普选和比例代表制为基础，制定一个宪法，保证平民有充分的自由和民主，保证基本的经济权利。
    （四）各民族有自决权，包括退盟之权。印度联邦应为自愿参加的，各省应为自治的和以语言划分的。
    （五）宪法应规定少数民族有公平和民主的权利，保护少数民族的平等权及语言和文化，以世袭阶级，种族和民族为基础的一切强迫性义务、特权和差别待遇，须由法律予为废止，违反者应受法律惩罚。
    （六）在印度各土邦内取消王公和封建统治，建立充分的民主制度，关于土邦应加入何国的问题，应暴露印度和巴基斯坦两国政府的政策，它们把某一土邦参加印度联邦或巴基斯坦国煊染成为伟大胜利，应该向平民解释，各土邦内部的迫切而首要的任务，是废除王公和封建统治，和建立人民的民主国家。在这之前，合并仅仅使各土邦人民奴役于王公专制政权以及印度联邦的资产阶级统治者们之下。只有在各土邦人民完全自由之后，他们才能有真正的自由来决定自己和印度其他地方的关系问题，在那个阶段，这问题将由人民的愿望来决定。
    （七）各部落及其他落后民族应有免于经济、文化和政治压迫的自由。应把充分的民主权利扩展到它们里边，国家应对它们的发展有及时而充分的协助，以使它们迅速赶上各先进民族。一切紧紧连接的、主要是部落的地区的民族，应该有地方自治权。他们可以在各省内成立自治区，关于区内一般行政，特别是关于直接和该区有关的政治和文化事务，享有充分的权力。在适当地区的这种区域内的民族，也可以组成一个或多个各别的省。这种区或省内的人民，应有权用民主的公决退出国家。
    （八）为了经济援助，为了国防而成立军事和政治同盟，为了和各民主国家合作以反对英美集团而采取民主的外交政策，印度联邦和巴基斯坦国之间应该合作。
    （九）无补偿地废止一切形式的地主制度，把土地分给耕种者。废除地主制度，必须要没收不耕地的土地所有者们的“哈斯”地，并使大小佃农确实获得土地。必须取消农村债务，废除高利贷；农村工人应有足以生活的工资。
    （十）国家没收外国资本在银行、工业和运输公司、庄园和矿山等企业中的利益，并使这些企业变成国有。
    （十一）大工业、大银行和保险公司国有化，保证工人的管理权，最低工资，八小时工作制等。
    （十二）制定经济计划，以发展印度资源，把大资产者从战略性的经济据点中驱除出去。管制私人手中的工业的利润。
    （十三）废止一切压迫性的法令。
    （十四）消灭官僚行政的国家机构，建立民主的行政机构，官员由民选，由人民的委员会加以指导。
    （十五）普遍武装人民，建立一支民主的军队。
    （十六）人民应有免费教育和强迫性的初等教育之权。
    （十七）妇女应有平等的民主的权利。
    工人、农民和印度人民其他被压迫部分中，对于民主运动主要口号的反响和了解，从没有象今天那末深广：废除地主制度，耕者有其田；废除王公专制制度；重要工业国有化，工资要能维持生活；民主的自由权等等。
    经济危机正在使非常巨大的许多力量活动起来。工人们正在以最高的勇气和大无畏的毅力再接再厉地战斗，而局面正在走向工人阶级的总攻势。在农业战线上，农民们也正在进入初步的高潮，击败着镇压者，反复走向进攻。
    领导工人阶级的一切斗争，团结并指引他们作为争取民主阵线纲领的斗争的一部分，为实现工人阶级的基本要求而奋斗，这是党的任务。
    共产党领导并指引这些斗争走向这个目标，站出来担任帝国主义最勇敢的敌手，担任反动的资产阶级全国领导机构及其走狗的最勇敢的敌手，就能够加速人民苏醒的过程，就能够坚固地建立无产阶级的盟主权，那盟主权是人民民主战斗成功的唯一保证。
    在世界危机的目前时期，把民主运动向前推动的任务，是工人阶级和它的党——共产党的责任。因此，劳动人民及其真正的朋友们，理应加强和扩大共产党，具有自觉性的党员，有马列主义党的训练和深深生根在劳动人民中间的群众性的党——这是我们的座右铭。（黄培译）
