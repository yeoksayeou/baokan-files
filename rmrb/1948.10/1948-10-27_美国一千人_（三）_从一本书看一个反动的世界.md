"One Thousand Americans" (III)
    -- Seeing a Reactionary World Through a Book
    By Saqi Yiwa, translated by Guan Mengjue
    V. American Fascism

　　Behind the reactionary propaganda of the "American way of life," the progressive forces in America have very clearly discerned the outlines of Fascism. Seldes said: "If Fascism comes to America, it will take the form of 'Americanism.'"
    He tried to open the eyes of those Americans who were blinded by this propaganda about the "American way of life," who were麻醉 [presumably a typo meaning 'numbed'] by this talk that American democracy is immutable and eternal; he also wanted to make those Americans see that Fascism represents a real threat to America because it has the backing of big consortia and financial oligarchs. He did not forget the lessons of the past few decades.
    "When reactionary forces resort to bayonets, the result is Fascism.
    This is what happened in Germany, Italy, Spain, and other countries." ("One Thousand Americans" are doing what the industrial magnates of Germany and Italy did before they put the Fascists on the stage.
    "In Italy, Germany, and America, for half a century or more, the leaders of commerce, industry, and banking have united all subsidized organizations to maintain the status quo, protect their wealth and power, and promote reactionary policies." (Page 195)
    The number of military reactionary organizations in the United States, whether quasi-fascist or openly fascist, is numerous and varied. Some organizations have disappeared, while others have risen to replace them, often changing their names; but those who support and subsidize them remain the same. Those people are the representatives of wealthy families and their general staff, the National Association of Manufacturers.
    The same people who used to fund the fascist "Liberty League" are now funding the latest darling of the large monopoly groups, the "American Action Committee" (now known as the "American Action Association"). These large monopoly groups are also colluding with the "American Legion" – the main candidate for the Italian-style Blackshirts – and, upon closer inspection, can be found to be in cahoots with most other fascist and semi-fascist organizations.
    Only with the support of Wall Street can it be explained that even during the war, when all the strength of the people was mobilized to fight Fascism, fascist organizations continued to exist and spread their propaganda in America. Even then, the McCormick and Hearst newspapers insisted on promoting fascism and racism.
    At that time, some of the "One Thousand Americans" concealed and denied their collusion with the Fascists. Now, however, after the war, supporting Fascism is considered a fashionable thing within the circle of the Sixty Families. In April 1945, the famous American Fascists, the DuPont family, the Pew family, the Ketterer family, the Weir family, and jurors Prentiss, Hart, and others, were nominated in the House of Representatives. Strangely and remarkably, only the Pew family felt the need to deny it. However, as is well known, this oil family has indeed funded some of the most openly fascist organizations, such as the "Crusaders" and the "Republican Sentinels."
    Leading figures of the National Association of Manufacturers often attend meetings and banquets of the "American Legion" and are members of this most infamous fascist organization. A prominent figure in the financial oligarchy's "inner circle," Dulles, is a leader of reactionary pastors. The National Association of Manufacturers attaches great importance to enlisting the help of churches in carrying out its fascist propaganda and has repeatedly subsidized reactionary church organizations. It has a special and very active propaganda department called the "Committee on Cooperation with Churches," whose chairman is none other than Crane, the deputy manager of DuPont Denimon Company. Therefore, it is not surprising that some pastors are engaged in fascist propaganda, spreading racial hatred and anti-Semitic theories, and scolding labor organizations. Father Coughlin, Dr. Van Velt, pastor and juror of the Los Angeles Combined Church, and Dr. Buchman, the founder of the "Moral Re-Armament" fallacy – who publicly declared that he thanked God for giving us Hitler – are all well-known and active Fascists. Buchman's specialty is to promote one of the "freedoms" advocated by the National Association of Manufacturers – "free enterprise," which in reality means the freedom to break strikes and eliminate trade unions. Buchman is generously subsidized by Ford, Hearst, Firestone, Eastman, and other millionaires, who are irreconcilable enemies of the working class.
    The terror racial organizations in the southern states, "Ku Klux Klan", "American Legion", "St. Hilbert's Regiment", "Nationalist Veterans of World War II", "Crusaders", "American Action Committee", "Republican Sentinels", "Silver Shirts", "Columbus Knights" – all these fascist and near-fascist organizations are maintained by the financial oligarchs. Their common purpose is to destroy communism, they all use fascist methods to combat the labor movement, and they are all spreading "Americanism". They are the loyal watchdogs of the financial oligarchs and their privileges.
    However, these organizations, whether united or individual, have ultimately failed to gain the following of any masses in America. However, Seldes tells us that recently, reactionary forces in America have attempted to establish something similar to a mass organization. This is the "Tool Owners Association". It clearly intends to attract a large part of the population. Its declared purpose is to enlist "the majority of the fifty million Americans who, by holding stocks and bonds, practicing life insurance, owning bank deposits, engaging in small businesses, engaging in agriculture, or professional activities, have a stake in the means of production." However, its fascist nature is so obvious that all the trade unions in New York have excluded it.
    During the war, many fascist organizations and their leaders were exposed and nominated in investigation reports and court trials, in the writings of Carlson, Hook, and others. The main danger of these enemies of democracy lies in the fact that they are maintained and funded by the financial oligarchs.
    The book "One Thousand Americans" describes:
    "Respectable Fascism belongs to the most powerful reactionary interest group, which will one day...decide to invest their billions in the bayonets of the Blackshirts or Brownshirts rather than accept the decision of the ballot box. Respectable Fascism – which is respectable because it has celebrities, power, and money – is maintained by almost everyone, especially newspapers and radio. Something akin to a silent conspiracy does exist.
    If the day comes when the same figures and the same organizations, who are now openly and legally expanding reactionary forces in America, once invest their billions in a villain whom they approve of, such as Smith, or a senator whom they approve of; if the huge Hearst-Howard, McCormick, Patterson-Gannett axis combines behind a fascist leader, then a coalition of money, newspapers, public opinion, fraud, and bayonets will be formed, and then we will be able to see Fascism in America replacing general reaction." (Page 196) (Translator's note: Hearst, Howard, McCormick, Patterson, and Gannett are all American newspaper monopoly groups.)
    Seldes only reveals the names of individuals and organizations. The National Association of Manufacturers is the same as the heads of the twelve wealthy companies and the Sixty Families. The DuPont Group, the Pew Group, Morgan's partners, Rockefeller, and Mellon, through their senators and ministers, through the two major Republican and Democratic parties, are controlling American domestic and foreign policies. The most outspoken representatives of American imperialism – Forrestal, Dulles, Vandenberg, Hoover, etc. – are nothing more than the leaders, appointees, or agents of the National Association of Manufacturers. It is the same general staff that has drawn up the Marshall Plan for Europe, textbooks for American schoolchildren, and films for the nations of the world, until these nations cannot protect their civilization and the minds of their young generation from the corrupting influence of "Americanism," from the spiritual poison and psychological corruption from overseas, from the world's center of reaction.
    Seldes believes that Fascism will appear in America when bankers invest in bayonets. However, the entire content of his book shows that the process of American fascization is in full swing, especially through various propaganda means – newspapers, radio, movies, schools. The growth of the worldwide democratic anti-imperialist movement and the solid progress of mankind towards socialism have aroused the deepest jealousy in the National Association of Manufacturers. The more difficult it is for the financial oligarchs to maintain their power by the old, hypocritical, and deceptively democratic methods, the more the masses want to "know" the inside story, and thus the more they can see through the fraudulent peep show and strive to protect their basic legitimate rights, and thus the more the imperialists abandon the annoying masks of democratic etiquette and resort to open repression, even formally abolishing the democratic rights of the people.
    Do not forget that Farben and other German monopoly groups used DuPont, Pew, Morgan, Rockefeller, and Hoover's money to hire the Hitler gang in the past. This gang burned down the German Reichstag, crushed the German Communist Party, trade unions, and democratic groups, abolished the last traces of bourgeois democracy and parliamentary politics, established a bloodthirsty fascist regime, and launched the most destructive war.
    American monopoly capitalists have rich experience. They know how to do it.
    Seldes devotes a great deal of space to narrating how American monopoly capitalists subsidized reactionary organizations, attacked trade unions and the labor movement, and trampled and undermined the democratic freedoms of the people, including freedom of the press, which Seldes considers to be the most important. Until recently, they did it so secretly or semi-secretly that, in any case, they did not make their activities widely known to the world.
    Seldes's book was published at the end of 1947, and it discusses events and facts of the past decade, including the post-war period, up to the second half of 1947. During this short period, the financial oligarchs have become incomparably more obvious in their attack on the rights of all peoples. Facts prove that the process of American fascization is in full swing. Wall Street tycoons are resorting to more naked methods to suppress democracy. Such unlimited persecution of progressive people and progressive organizations, such blatant attacks on workers' rights, freedom of thought, and human dignity, are unprecedented in American history. It has never experienced such rampant militarism and narrow social patriotism, such propaganda of racial hatred, violence, and coercion, and such mad clamor for war.

　　“美国一千人”（三）
    ——从一本书看一个反动的世界
    萨基伊瓦著  关梦觉译
    五、美国的法西斯主义
    在反动派强烈宣传“美国生活方式”的背后，美国的进步势力业已很清楚地分辨出来法西斯主义的轮廓。赛尔底斯说：“如果法西斯主义出现于美国，它将采取‘美国主义’的形式。”
    他试图去开那些美国人的眼光，即他们竟为这种关于“美国生活方式”的宣传所蒙蔽，他们竟为这种谈论所麻醉，即美国的民主是一成不变的、万世不易的；他并且想要使那些美国人看到法西斯主义对于美国代表着一个真正的威胁，因为它有大财阀、金融寡头为之背景。他并没有忘记过去几十年来的教训。
    “当反动势力借助于刺刀的时候，结果就是法西斯主义。
    这就是在德国、意大利、西班牙、以及其他国家所曾发生的事情。”（第一九五页）“美国一千人”正在进行过去德、意两国产业大亨们于其把法西斯蒂捧上台前所曾做过的事情。
    “在意大利、在德国、以及在美国，半世纪或更多些以来，商业、工业和银行业的领袖们，曾把一切受津贴的组织都联合起来，以致力于维持现状、保护他们的财富和权力、推行反动政策。”（第一九五页）
    美国的军事反动组织，无论是接近法西斯的或公然法西斯的，其数目甚多且多种多样。有的组织消逝了，而其他的组织则起而代之，它们常常变换名称；但支持并津贴它们的那些人，却总是不变。那些人就是富豪家族的代表们及其参谋本部，即全国制造家协会。
    过去曾资助法西斯“自由同盟”的同一人物，现在又资助大独占集团最新的宠儿“美国行动委员会”了（现在又称为“美国行动会社”）。这些大独占集团又与“美国军团”——它是意大利式黑衫队的主要候补者——互相结纳，而如果更仔细地检查起来，则可以发现它们与大多数其他的法西斯和半法西斯组织无不狼狈为奸。
    只有得到华尔街的支持，才能解释这事实，即甚至在战时，当人民的一切力量都被动员起来和法西斯主义作战的时候，而法西斯组织还是继续存在并在美国散布其宣传。甚至在那时，麦考米克与赫斯特系的报纸还坚持宣传法西斯主义和种族主义。
    彼时某些“美国一千人”曾隐蔽并否认他们和法西斯的勾结。然而现在，战争结束以后，支持法西斯主义，在六十家族的圈内，竟被认为是顶上的风雅。一九四五年四月，著名的美国法西斯蒂杜邦家族、皮氏家族、季特勒家族、威尔家族、以及陪审官普伦蒂斯、哈特、及其他人等，曾被在众议院提名。很奇异并且很出色的、只有皮氏家族才认为有否认的必要。可是，如所周知，这个石油家族曾千真万确地资助过某些最公开的法西斯组织，如同“十字军”与“共和哨兵团”等等。
    全国制造家协会的领导人物常出席“美国军国”的会议和宴会，并且是这个声名最狼藉的法西斯组织的会员。金融寡头“内圈”的显要分子杜勒斯，乃是反动牧师们的领导人物。全国制造家协会在进行其法西斯宣传上，很重视争取教会协助，并屡次津贴反动的教会组织。它有一个特殊的并很活跃的宣传部门，名为“与教会合作委员会”，它的主席不是别人，而是杜邦·狄尼蒙公司的副经理克兰。因此，有若干牧师竟从事于法西斯宣传、散布种族仇恨和反犹太的理论、并詈骂劳工组织，也就不足为奇了。考林神甫，洛杉矶组合教会的牧师兼陪审官范费尔特博士，以及“精神重整军备”谬论的创立者布齐曼博士——他曾公开宣称感谢上帝给我们以希特勒——这些人，都是著名活跃的法西斯蒂。布齐曼的专业就是鼓吹全国制造家协会所拥护的“自由”之一——“自由企业”，这实际上是意味着破坏罢工和消灭工会的自由。布齐曼被福特、赫斯特、费尔斯东、伊斯特曼、以及其他的百万富翁们很慷慨地津贴着，他们都是工人阶级不共戴天的敌人。
    南部各州的恐怖的种族组织“三Ｋ党”、“美国军团”、“圣·希伯坦团”、“第二次世界大战国家主义退伍军人团”、“十字军”、“美国行动委员会”、“共和哨兵团”、“银衫团”、“哥伦布武士团”——所有这些法西斯的和近法西斯的组织，都由金融寡头们维持着。它们的共同目的就是毁灭共产主义，他们都用法西斯手段去打击劳工运动，他们都在散布“美国主义”。他们是金融寡头及其特权的忠实警犬。
    可是这些组织无论是联合起来也好，单个的也好，终不能得到美国任何群众的追随。不过，赛尔底斯却告诉我们，最近美国反动劳力竟企图建立某种类似群众组织的东西。这就是“工具所有者协会”。它显然打算去网罗一大部分人口。它所宣布的目的就是罗致“五千万美国人的大部分，据说这些美国人，由于掌握股票债票，实行人寿保险，拥有银行存款，经营小营业、从事于农业或职业活动，对于生产工具有利害关系”。然而其法西斯性质竟如此明显，乃至在纽约各职工会都把它排出会外。
    在战时，许多法西斯组织及其领袖，曾被揭发并提名于调查报告及法庭审判中，于卡尔逊、胡克及其他人的著作中。这些民主敌人的主要危险乃在于他们系被金融寡头们所维护并资助着的。
    “美国一千人”这本书描写道：
    “有体面的法西斯主义是属于最有势力的反动利得集团的，这个集团将来……会有一天决定去把他们的亿万资金投于黑衫队或褐衫队的刺刀上面而不接受选举票箱的决定。有体面的法西斯主义——它之所以有体面，是因为它有名人、权力和金钱——几乎被每一个人、尤其是报纸和无线电所维护着。类乎一个沉默阴谋的某种东西，确实存在着。
    假如有那么一天到来，即相同的人物和相同的组织，现在公开合法地在美国扩大反动势力者，一旦投其亿万资金于一个被他们所嘉许的奸雄身上，如同史密斯，或被他所认可的某一个参议员；假如巨大的赫斯特——霍华德、麦考米克、柏德荪——加纳特轴心在某一个法西斯领袖的背后结合起来，这样，就形成了一个金钱、报纸、舆论、欺诈和刺刀的联盟，于是乎我们就能够看到，在美国，法西斯主义代替了一般的反动。”（第一九六页）（译者按：赫斯特、霍华德、麦考米克、柏德荪、加纳特，都是美国的报业独占集团。）
    赛尔底斯仅揭露了个人和组织的名字。全国制造家协会是和十二家富豪公司的首脑以及六十家族同一的东西。杜邦集团、皮氏集团、摩根的伙友、洛克菲勒和梅隆，通过他们的议员和部长们，通过共和与民主两大政党，在支配着美国的内外政策。美国帝国主义最直言的代表——福莱斯特尔、杜勒斯、范登堡、胡佛等等——无非是全国制造家协会的领袖、被任命者或代理人而已。同是这个参谋本部，为欧洲编制了马歇尔计划，为美国的学童们编制了教科书，为世界各民族编制了影片，驯至这些民族不能保护其文明和青年一代的心灵，使之免于“美国主义”宣传的败坏影响，使之免于来自海外、来自世界反动中心的精神的毒害和心理的腐化。
    赛尔底斯相信，当银行家投资于刺刀的时候，法西斯主义就要在美国出现。然而他书中的全部内容却表明了美国的法西斯化过程，正在全力进行中，特别是通过各种宣传手段——报纸、无线电、电影、学校。全世界民主的反帝国主义运动的增长，人类向社会主义的踏实前进，对于全国制造家协会无不引起最深刻的嫉恨。金融寡头们用旧日伪造的、假善的民主方法去维持其权力越是困难，群众们就越发想要“知道”底细，因而他们就越能看穿了欺诈的西洋景并努力于去保护他们的基本合法权利，于是乎帝国主义者也就越发抛弃了民主礼仪的讨厌的假面具，并诉之于公开的镇压，甚至正式废除人民的民主权利。
    不要忘记，法尔本公司及其他德国独占集团，过去曾用杜邦、皮氏、摩根、洛克菲勒和胡佛的金钱，去雇佣过希特勒匪帮。这个匪帮，曾烧毁了德国国会、粉碎了德国共产党、职工会、及民主团体，废除了资产阶级民主和议会政治的最后痕迹，建立了嗜血的法西斯统治，并掀起了最破坏的战争。
    美国独占资本家有丰富经验。他们晓得怎样办。
    赛尔底斯用很长的篇幅去叙述美国独占资本家们如何去津贴反动组织、去打击职工会与劳工运动、去蹂躏并破坏人民的民主自由，包括新闻自由在内，赛尔底斯认为新闻自由是最重要的。直到最近，他们竟做得这样秘密或半秘密，乃至无论如何，没有使他们的活动大白于世。
    赛尔底斯的书系一九四七年年底出版，它讨论过去十年来的事变与事实，包括战后时期，一直到一九四七年下半年为止。在这个短期间内，金融寡头们在其进攻各族人民的权利方面，已经变成无比的更明显了。事实证明美国的法西斯化过程正在全力进行中。华尔街的大亨们正在借助于更赤裸裸的方法去镇压民主。象这样无限制的迫害进步人士和进步组织，象这样公然攻击工人的权利、思想自由和人类的尊严，在美国史无前例。它从未曾经历过这样猖狂的军国主义和狭隘的社会爱国主义，这样宣传种族仇恨、暴力和威迫，这样疯狂的叫嚣战争。
