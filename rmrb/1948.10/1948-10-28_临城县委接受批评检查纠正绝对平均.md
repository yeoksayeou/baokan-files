[Taihang Telegraph] The Lincheng County Committee, having accepted the criticism from the prefectural committee (see this newspaper, 16th), convened an emergency meeting to examine the errors in the previous conclusion of the land reform. It formulated a policy and specific steps to correct these errors. After receiving the criticism from the prefectural committee, the county conducted in-depth investigations into the issues concerning the conclusion of land reform in forty-two villages. The villages with the most serious errors accounted for one-quarter of the total. For example, in Beiwencun, the proportion of readjustments reached 39% this time, involving forty households being drawn from and twenty-nine households being supplemented, creating new chaos in the countryside. Out of the eleven households that had land added, half should not have had land added. Widows and widowers did not want land due to a lack of labor, but the district cadres said, "This is the only chance, if you don't want it, won't you sell it?" One old man already had a grain yield of three and a half *shi*, but he was forced to have it increased to five *shi*. As a result, the old man was constantly worried that he couldn't cultivate the land. The targets of attack were Party members, cadres, and new middle peasants. The village head of Shandongcun, who had only taken office last year, had his fruits returned because he was a cadre. One immigrant household, which had received slightly more land when taking care of refugees, had a significant portion of their land taken back this time. This household now cries at the mere mention of it. Shandicun even determined five sources and methods of replenishment that clearly violated policy principles: "(1) Cadres and the masses who exceeded the average must return the excess. (2) Among one hundred households, no more than thirty households should have land taken back. (3) Households that were previously struggled against should not be included in this round of readjustments. (4) Old middle peasants should not be targeted for taking land back, as their property is earned through their own labor, which would be embarrassing; the new middle peasants are those who we gave land to, so they are easier to talk to. (5) All households that received fruits are new middle peasants." (The indiscriminate drawing from all those who have benefited from the land reform will inevitably strike and has already struck the newly liberated poor peasants, hired peasants and new middle peasants. The ideological root of this behavior is the negation of the correctness of last year's land reform and is a manifestation of right-leaning opportunism. This phenomenon has already occurred in many places and must be corrected. - Editor) After concrete inspection, the county party committee realized that it had not properly conveyed the resolution of the August county party committee joint meeting, only convening a branch secretary joint meeting, with one day spent conveying and one day spent discussing, while the entire spirit of the August meeting was not understood by the broad district and village cadres. This rash and imprudent attitude, coupled with the county committee's own absolute egalitarianism ideology not being eliminated, led to the error of policy principles in this conclusion of the land reform. In order to quickly correct this, several concrete steps were studied: (1) Correctly publicize the Party's policies in concluding land reform in order to correct deviations in the implementation of policies. (2) Establish temporary people's representative conferences in villages to carry out corrections. (3) The principle for correcting deviations in concluding land reform is: generally do not move much; if the land added was very inappropriate and too much land was taken back, appropriately return part of it; if the scope of movement is wide, but the amount is not large, it is also better not to move it. In correcting the deviations arising from the conclusion of land reform, it is necessary to pay close attention to conforming to the masses' thoughts and demands. For example, some insisted on getting their own things back, while others said let it go, going back and forth without end. Patient policy publicity and explanation work should be carried out in order to achieve the goal of unity and production. (4) Publicize that this is the conclusion of land reform, determining land ownership, and the final decision, and that there will be no further changes in the future, in order to stabilize the emotions of all classes and increase the enthusiasm for production. (5) Assess and measure land, clarify land ownership, issue land certificates, and mobilize to shift to large-scale production.

　　临城县委接受批评检查纠正绝对平均
    【太行电】临城县委接受地委批评（见十六日本报），召开紧急会议，检查前结束土改工作中的错误，订出改正错误的方针与具体步骤，该县接到地委批评后，深入检查了四十二个村结束土改中的问题，错误最严重的占全部村庄的四分之一。如北温村只这次抽动面即占百分之三十九，抽了四十户，补了二十九户，造成农村新的混乱。从填地的十一户中看，有二分之一是不该填地的。孤寡因无劳力不要土地，区干部说：“就这一次了，你不要不会卖了？”有一老汉，产粮已三石五斗，非给填到五石不可，结果老汉成天发愁地种不了；而打击的对象是党员干部与新中农。该村村长是去年才当上，因是干部，也退了果实。有一移民户，在当时照顾外来逃荒户时稍多分了一点，这次退的十分重，这户现在一提起来就哭哭啼啼。山底村并确定了五条显然是违犯政策原则的补绽来源与办法：“（一）干部群众超过平均数的一律退。（二）一百户中，退者不超过三十户。（三）过去被斗户不在这次抽动之列。（四）不计划抽老中农，因其财产是自己劳动的，不好意思；新中农是我们给的，好说话。（五）凡分得果实的户都是新中农。”（笼统地不加区别地抽动一切在土改中得到果实的人，一定会打击到而且已经打击到新翻身的贫雇农和新中农，这种行为的思想根源，是否定去年土改的正确性、是一种右倾机会主义的表现，此种现象已在许多地方发生了，必须纠正。——编者）经过具体检查后，县委已初步认识到自己没有将八月县委联席会议的决议传达好，只召开了个分书联席会，传达了一天，讨论了一天，而八月会议的整个精神，未为广大区村干部所了解。这种轻率的不慎重的态度，加上县委自己的绝对平均主义思想未肃清，致使这次结束土改中犯了政策原则的错误。为了迅速纠正，特研究出几个具体步骤：（一）正确宣传结束土改中党的政策，以纠正执行政策中之偏向。（二）成立村里的临时人代会，进行纠正。（三）纠正结束土改中偏向的原则是：一般的不大动；如填的十分不妥和抽的过多，要适当退还部；动的面宽，但量不大的，也以不再动为妥。在纠正结束土改中产生的偏向时，要十分注意适合群众，思想与要求。如有的非要回自己的东西不可，也有的说算了吧，反来复去的没头了。应进行耐心的政策宣传与解释工作，以达到团结生产之目的。（四）宣传这次是结束土改，确定地权最后定案，今后再不更动，以稳定各阶层情绪，提高生产积极性。（五）评丈土地，澄清后发土地证，动员转向大生产。
