Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Reports from various sources state that the general strike of workers in all industries across France, led by the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and joined by the "Workers' Force" union and the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), took place as scheduled on the 24th. The strike duration varied from two to twenty-four hours, with over seven million participants. In Paris, public transportation and international telegraph and telephone services were disrupted due to the strike of public transportation workers and telecommunications workers, and airplanes could not take off. French Prime Minister Queuille's scheduled nationwide broadcast speech on the night of the 24th was also forced to be postponed due to the strike of employees at the international broadcasting station. This massive, orderly strike "virtually paralyzed all governmental and commercial activities" (Associated Press), causing "dangerous tremors" (Associated Press) for the cabinet, which had only been formed two weeks prior. After the French General Confederation of Labor, the "Workers' Force" union, and the Christian Workers' League issued a joint public statement on the 20th demanding a 33 and 1/3 percent wage increase, the Queuille government only announced a 15 percent wage increase at the start of the strike, but at the same time announced a 20 percent increase in long-distance train tickets and a 60 percent increase in long-term tickets. In addition, subway fares will also be doubled. Bus fares will increase by 50 percent. Coal prices are scheduled to increase by 25 percent, and gas by 20 percent. Due to these increases in transportation and fuel costs, the prices of other food and industrial products will also rise. Therefore, the state-owned coal mine, electrical industry, and other major unions announced on the 25th that if workers' demands are not met, a general strike will continue. "It is generally believed that this is the biggest crisis the French government has ever encountered" (Associated Press, Paris, 25th).

　　法七百万人总罢工
    使政府遭遇历来的最大危机
    【新华社陕北三十日电】各方报导：由法国总工会领导并有“工人力量”工会与基督教工人联盟参加的全法各业工人总罢工于二十四日如期举行。罢工时间自二小时至二十四小时不等，参加人数达七百万以上。在巴黎，由于公共运输工人及电信工人的罢工，公共交通及国际电报电话均中断，飞机不能起飞。法总理葛义原定于二十四日夜对全国的广播演讲，也因国际广播电台职工罢工而被迫延期。这一规模巨大的有秩序的罢工，“实际上使一切政府的与商业的活动都陷于瘫痪”（合众社），使刚成立两周的内阁“发生了危险的动摇”（美联社）。自法国总工会、“工人力量”工会及基督教工人联盟于二十日发表联合公报要求增资百分之三十三又三分之一后，葛义政府仅于罢工开始时才宣布允许增资百分之十五，但同时却又宣布将远程火车票加价百分之二十，长期车票加价百分之六十。此外，地下铁道票价也将加倍。公共汽车票价增百分之五十。预定煤价将增加百分之二十五，煤汽百分之二十。由于这次运费与燃料涨价，其他食品与工业品的价格均将上涨。因此，国营煤矿、电气工业等工会及其他各主要工会，于二十五日宣布，如工人要求不能得到满足，将继续举行总罢工。“一般认为这是法国政府历来所遭遇的最大危机”（合众社巴黎二十五日电）。
