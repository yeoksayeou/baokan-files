　　Jianping Launches Crash Program to Plow Land and Sow Wheat
    [North Yue News] On September 25th, most areas of Jianping experienced thorough rainfall. County and district leaders are organizing manpower and livestock to launch a crash program to plow land and sow wheat. Garden plots along the Hutuo River have all been plowed once. In the First District, all the paddy fields have been plowed once, and two-thirds of the dry land has been plowed. In villages such as Zhongguyue and Nanxingyuan, some wheat paddy fields have been plowed twice or are being plowed for the second time. To solve the difficulties of lacking labor and draft animals for plowing, the County Promotion Cooperative decided to lend 54 head of livestock to the masses for plowing and buying land (selling a "xiang" of land), which has had a great effect. Some farmers have voluntarily combined their livestock to plow land for households lacking labor, charging a price of 2,000 to 2,500 yuan per mu, or three and a half sheng of corn. In Hongzidian, First District, 100 households participated in the mutual aid labor program, with 76 men, 65 women, 38 draft animals, and 35 children, forming a total of 23 mutual aid labor teams. Taking the household as a unit, with all able-bodied laborers included, a total of 840 workdays were contributed to autumn harvest and autumn plowing. In the Second District, four villages including Tangjiahui organized 14 mutual aid labor teams, with a total of 50 people. In the Sixth District, labor mobilization emphasized mobilization through the Party branch. Yang Jinni, director of the Women's Federation of Wangjia'an, led 52 women to go to the fields for production. (Feng Jingye)
