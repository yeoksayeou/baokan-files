　　Selling Enemy and Puppet Trademarks Should Be Prohibited

Comrade Editor:
    During my recent travels to Xingtai, Handan, Changzhi, and other places, I saw many colored foreign cloths with enemy and puppet trademarks in cloth shops and stalls. Such as the "Golden Three Clocks" brand from the Tianjin Hua Min Factory, the "Deer and Crane Celebrating Spring" brand from Jinan, and the "Golden Rooster" brand from the Baoding Baoyang Factory, etc. After careful investigation, I found that the cloth was entirely produced in the Liberated Areas. The puppet trademarks were mostly bought from various places by dyeing shops such as De Shun Quan, Min Yi Quan, and Gong Quan in Xingtai City. They dyed the cloth into colors, affixed the puppet trademarks, and then called them their own products. When asked why they sell puppet trademarks, the cloth merchants said, "Sales here depend on the brand, not the quality. No matter what the cloth is, as long as it has a brand, it will sell better even if it's more expensive." The dyeing shop owners said, "Just by sticking on a brand, we can increase sales and raise the dyeing price."

    I believe that this kind of selling puppet trademarks and disrupting the market is purely speculation, only considering personal immediate interests, which is very detrimental to the development of our industry and commerce and the prosperity of the market, and gives opportunities for smuggling enemy goods. To overcome the above-mentioned bad phenomena, I suggest that the local industrial and commercial departments immediately inspect and prohibit it. We should encourage various dyeing shops to create their own new brands, and the government should protect the exclusive right to use trademarks. And we should educate the masses to respect our own created local goods and products from the Liberated Areas.

　　贩卖敌伪商标应禁止编辑同志：
    我这次旅行到邢台、邯郸、长治等地，见到布铺及布摊上有许多种敌伪商标的色洋布。如天津华民厂金三钟牌，济南鹿鹤同春牌，保定保阳厂金雄鸡牌等等。我仔细调查了一番，布料完全是解放区的产品。伪商标多是由邢台市德顺泉、民意泉、公泉等染坊铺从各地搜买来，他们染成色布，贴上伪商标，就称为本号出品。问为什么贩卖伪商标？布商们说：“此地销货认牌不认货，不管什么布有一个牌号，就贵点也好卖。”染坊铺掌柜说：“随便贴上个牌子买卖就多，染价可提高。”
    我认为象这种贩卖伪商标，混乱市场的现象，纯系投机倒把，单从个人眼下利益着想，与发展我们的工商业、繁荣市场有很大损害，给敌货走私钻空的机会。为克服以上不良现象，我建议当地工商部门即刻检查禁止。应提倡各染坊自己创造新牌号，政府要保护商标的专用权。并教育群众尊重自己创造的土货和解放区的产品。　　　　　　　金衡
