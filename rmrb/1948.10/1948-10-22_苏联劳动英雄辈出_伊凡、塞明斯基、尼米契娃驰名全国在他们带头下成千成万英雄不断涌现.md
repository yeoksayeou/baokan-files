　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS reports: In the socialist emulation campaigns throughout the Soviet Union, many labor heroes continue to emerge, creating brilliant achievements on the labor front day by day. Ivan Rakhmanin, a famous bricklayer working in Kyiv, has laid a total of 4.5 million bricks in the two years and eight months of the post-war Five-Year Plan, completing fifteen years of work and breaking architectural records. When he joined the reconstruction work in Kyiv in the autumn of 1945, the original quota for bricklaying per shift was 1,500 bricks. Within the first month, he increased it to 6,000. Later, through continuous improvement of work methods and increased labor productivity, by the beginning of 1946, he achieved the astonishing record of laying 129,000 bricks in one shift. Comparable to Ivan Rakhmanin is Seminsky, a machinist at the Kyiv "Red Excavator Factory," who has completed fourteen years of production. His technical improvements have saved hundreds of thousands of rubles in costs. In this year alone, he has made 23 technical improvements. Recently, a new movement to increase the speed of spindles has begun in the Soviet textile industry, initiated by Nimicheva, a female worker at a textile factory near Moscow. She manages 1,440 spindles alone, exceeding the standard by 350; by mid-July, she had already completed this year's production plan. With the permission of the factory management, she further increased the speed of her spindles by 10 percent. The Soviet Ministry of Textile Industry considers her initiative to be the beginning of a new movement to increase labor productivity and specially summoned her to Moscow to report her working methods and experience to the Minister of Textile Industry. A new movement to increase spindle speed is now being widely launched throughout the Soviet Union. Ivan Rakhmanin, Seminsky, and Nimicheva are all nationally renowned for their brilliant labor achievements. Under their leadership, tens of thousands of heroes are constantly emerging among the Soviet working people. More than 2,500 Stakhanovites in Kuibyshev and more than 400 miners in Moscow, Donets, and Stalino have completed the Five-Year Plan. More than 10,000 Stakhanovites in Kyiv have completed four to six years of production, and more than 20,000 workers in Kuibyshev have completed this year's plan.

　　苏联劳动英雄辈出
  　伊凡、塞明斯基、尼米契娃驰名全国在他们带头下成千成万英雄不断涌现
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社讯：苏联各地社会主义竞赛中，继续不断地涌现出许多劳动英雄，在劳动战线上日新月异地创造出辉煌成绩。在基辅工作的著名的砌砖工人伊凡·拉赫马宁，在战后五年计划的两年另八个月中，共砌砖四百五十万块，已经完成了十五年的工作，打破了建筑史上的纪录。当他一九四五年秋参加基辅的重建工作时，每一班工作时间砌砖的原定额是一千五百块，在头一个月内，他就增加到六千块，后来经过不断的改良工作方法和提高劳动生产率，到一九四六年初，他就达到了在一班工作时间中砌砖十二万九千块的惊人纪录。可以和伊凡·拉赫马宁媲美的是基辅“红色挖掘机工厂”的机工塞明斯基，他已经完成了十四年的生产，他在技术上的改进，节省了几十万卢布成本，仅在今年，他就作了廿三种技术改进。最近，苏联纺织工业中又开始了一个增加纺锭旋转速度的新运动，发起者是莫斯科附近一个纺织厂的女工尼米契娃，她一个人管理一千四百四十个纺锭，超出标准三百五十个；在七月中旬就已经完成了今年的生产计划。经过工厂经理部的准许，她又把她的纺锭旋转速度增加了百分之十。苏联纺织工业部认为她的创举是提高劳动生产率之新运动的开始，特别召她到莫斯科向纺织工业部长报告她的工作方法和经验。现在全苏各地正在广泛地展开着增加纺锭旋转速度的新运动。伊凡·拉赫马宁、塞明斯基和尼米契娃，都由于他们辉煌的劳动功绩驰名全国。在他们的带头之下，苏联劳动人民中正不断地出现成千成万的英雄。古比雪夫的二千五百多斯塔哈诺夫运动者及莫斯科、顿尼兹和斯大林诺的四百多矿工已经完成了五年计划，基辅的一万多斯塔哈诺夫运动者完成了四年到六年的生产，古比雪夫的两万多工人已完成今年的计划。
