Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Progressive Party in the United States has made significant progress on the eve of the election. To date, it has completed registration in forty-five of the forty-eight states nationwide, obtaining the qualifications to participate in the election. It is generally believed that this is a great achievement for the Progressive Party. The various reactionary laws enacted by the US ruling class to restrict the new party movement in various states cannot prevent the Progressive Party from gaining popular support. California stipulated that 276,000 citizens' signatures were required to apply for a new party registration, but the Progressive Party completed 500,000 signatures. Illinois stipulated that 103,000 people must sign the application within four weeks, but the Progressive Party completed 300,000 signatures in two weeks. Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace and vice-presidential candidate Taylor are intensifying their campaign trips to various places as the election draws nearer. In mid-October, Wallace went to the South again to campaign and insisted on speaking only at racially integrated gatherings, regardless of the South's reactionary segregation system. Although the Southern reactionaries used all kinds of illegal means to obstruct, and even used agents to kidnap the Progressive Party's staff in Augusta, Georgia, Wallace's speeches in Georgia and Tennessee still won warm support from the vast audience. When Wallace spoke in Pittsburgh on the 19th, reactionaries hit his speech with eggs, but this vulgar behavior only made his speech more deeply rooted in people's hearts. Wallace delivers radio speeches almost every night. According to Progressive Party campaign director Baldwin, these speeches have received enthusiastic support.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: TASS Moscow, 23rd: All newspapers here published a long feature describing the American political situation on the eve of the election. The author first stated that Dewey's strength was mainly due to the unanimous support of the largest bankers and monopoly capitalists. In addition, he also has the backing of publishing monopoly capitalists in New York and other American cities, with the exception of the southern states, because the Democratic Party's power is dominant in those areas. It is generally believed that the Republican Party will mainly gain the support of the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie. In addition, Dewey is also trying to establish closer ties with reactionary groups among ethnic minorities in major cities, such as pro-fascist Polish and Italian groups. In this entire campaign, Truman has enjoyed insignificant sponsorship from large industrialists, but he has the support of bureaucrats and most of the leaders of the AFL and CIO unions. Wallace relies on the masses of voters, especially the working class. In the labor movement, he has the support of the leaders of twelve unions. In addition, he has great prestige among blacks, Jews and other ethnic minorities, as well as progressive intellectuals. The author of the article pointed out that no matter what the outcome of this election, it will make the Progressive Party a permanent organization. The achievement of this goal means that an important new force has emerged in American political life.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: As the US election nears, the campaign movements of the Democratic and Republican parties, which both represent the interests of monopoly capitalists, have reached their climax. Democratic presidential candidate Truman and Republican presidential candidate Dewey deliver dozens of speeches every day to try to deceive voters for their votes. After completing their campaign trip in the Midwest in mid-October, they rushed to conduct the final stage of their campaign trips. Their campaign speeches are just constantly repeating clichés. Truman's strategy is still to shamelessly pose as a supporter of "liberalism" and portray himself as the "representative of the masses." But the foreign policy he puts forward is no different from Dewey's; on domestic issues, he attacks the Republican-dominated 80th Congress for obstructing price control measures, but he forgets that price controls were abolished during his own and the Democratic-dominated 79th Congress. In his recent speeches, Dewey began to talk about domestic issues that he had not touched on during his first campaign trip. In his speech in Pittsburgh on the 11th, he praised the Taft-Hartley Act as having "proven to be a benefit to workers," and then casually mentioned some promises such as "building water conservancy and protecting soil" without any guarantees. Dewey and Truman both expressed fear in their speeches about the coming economic panic. In order to deceive voters, Dewey self-deceptively fantasizes that the United States can continue to prosper and make "the theory of prosperity and panic cycle prove to be forever wrong." But Truman predicts that the Republican government will lead to another economic panic like in 1929. Truman's judgment is correct, although no one believes his claim that the Democratic Party can prevent economic panic.

### 美国大选前夕　进步党在四十五州完成登记　民主共和两党竞选丑态百出

　　美国大选前夕
  　进步党在四十五州完成登记
  　民主共和两党竞选丑态百出
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方报导：美国进步党在大选前夕已获得长足进展，迄今已在全国四十八州中之四十五州完成登记，取得参加大选的资格。一般认为这是进步党的一项伟大成就。美国统治阶级为了限制新党运动在各州所订的种种反动法律，并不能阻止进步党获得人民的支持。加利福尼亚州规定须有二十七万六千公民签名申请，方能允许新党登记，进步党却完成了五十万人的签名；伊利诺斯州规定须十万三千人在四周内签名申请，进步党却在两周内即完成了三十万人的签名。进步党总统候选人华莱士与副总统候选人泰勒，在此大选日益逼近之际，正加紧赴各地作旅行竞选。本月中旬，华莱士曾再度赴南方竞选，并不顾南方反动的隔离制度坚持只在黑人与白人混合的集会上演说。虽然南方反动派用尽种种非法手段阻挠，甚至以特务绑架进步党在乔治亚州奥古斯大的工作人员，但华莱士在乔治亚州与田纳西州的演说，仍然获得广大听众的热烈拥护。十九日华莱士在匹兹堡演说时为反动分子以鸡蛋击中其演讲稿，但这种下流行为徒然使他的演说更深入人心。华莱士几乎每晚都发表广播演说，据进步党竞选主任鲍尔温向塔斯社记者称：这些演说都得到热烈的拥护。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：此间各报均刊载一长篇特写，描写大选前夕的美国政治形势。作者首称，杜威的力量主要是由于得到最大的银行家及独占资本家的一致支持。此外，他还得到纽约与美国其他城市出版业独占资本家作后盾，仅南部诸州例外，因为民主党的势力在那些地区占优势。一般相信，共和党将主要地得到城乡小资产阶级的支持。此外，杜威又企图与各大城市少数民族中的反动集团，如亲法西斯的波兰人、意大利人团体建立更亲密的接触。在这次整个的竞选运动中，杜鲁门享有的大工业家的赞助殊无足轻重，但他获有官僚及劳联、产联所属各工会大部分领导方面的拥护。华莱士则依靠选民群众，特别是工人群众。在工运中，他有十二个工会的领袖的拥护。此外，他在黑人、犹太人及其他少数民族以及进步知识分子中很有威望。该文作者指出，不管这次选举的结果如何，都将使进步党成为一个永久的组织。这一目的的达成，意味着美国政治生活中出现了重要的新力量。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】美国大选期近，同样代表垄断资本家利益的民主与共和两党的竞选运动已达高潮。民主党总统候选人杜鲁门与共和党总统候选人杜威每天都发表成打的演说，借以骗取选民的选票。他们于本月中旬在中西部竞选旅行结束后，又急急忙忙进行其最后阶段的旅行竞选。他们的竞选演说只是不断重复着的陈辞滥调。杜鲁门的策略依然是无耻地冒充“自由主义”的支持者，自封为“大众的代表”。但是他所提出外交政策却与杜威毫无不同；在内政问题上，他攻击共和党占优势的八十届国会阻挠物价管制之类的措施，却忘了物价管制就正是在他自己与民主党占优势的七十九届国会任内废除的。杜威在最近的演说中开始谈到了他第一次竞选旅行时未曾涉及的内政问题。他十一日在匹兹堡演说时，赞扬塔夫脱——哈特莱法案“已证明为对工人的一种恩惠”，此外则只随便提了一些诸如“兴修水利保护土壤”之类毫无保证的诺言。杜威与杜鲁门都在演说中对行将到来的经济恐慌表示恐惧。为了欺骗选民，杜威自欺欺人地幻想：美国能继续繁荣而使“繁荣与恐慌循环之说证明为永远错误”。但是杜鲁门却预告共和党政府将象一九二九年那样导向又一次的经济恐慌。杜鲁门的这个判断是确实的，虽然他说民主党可以防止经济恐慌的话没有人相信。
