　　【Taiyue Telegram】Yicheng County has established a short-term normal school to train teachers. In August, the county government organized a training session for current primary school teachers and conducted a test. Among the 555 examinees, 182 failed in Chinese language, including 4 who submitted blank papers and 1 who wrote only two sentences. 250 people wrote incorrect characters. 414 failed in arithmetic, including 137 with zero scores. Generally, they did not know the order of operations (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction) and could not solve decimal arithmetic problems, nor could they solve problems with parentheses or percentages. 282 failed in general knowledge. Some answered that "Tito" was a "group of countries," some answered that the reason for rain was "to grow crops," and some answered that the four major tasks of the North China Liberated Area were "rational burden" etc. From this, it can be seen that if the political and cultural level of primary school teachers is not improved, it will be difficult to shoulder the important responsibility of national education. In order to improve the current teachers and train new teachers, the leadership established a short-term normal school in September. On the one hand, it recruits new students to train new teachers (the study period is one year), and on the other hand, it trains current teachers in rotation to improve their cultural and political level (each term is three months). It adopts the method of concentrated selection and key education, and sends people to receive training in whatever courses they are deficient in. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the daily learning of in-service teachers, adhere to a two-hour learning system every day, the content of learning is uniformly arranged by the government, and regular tests are conducted.

　　翼城成立短期师范
    【太岳电】翼城县成立短期师范，培养师资。八月间，该县县府曾集训现任小学教员，进行了一次测验，应试的五百五十五人中，国语不及格者一百八十二人，其中送白卷者四人，写两句者一人。写错白字的二百五十人。算术不及格者四百一十四人，内有零分的一百三十七人，一般都不会先乘除后加减和整小数四则，括弧解不了，百分法算不了。常识不及格的二百八十二人，有把“铁托”答成是“集团国”的，有把下雨原因答成“为长庄稼”，有把华北解放区的当前四大任务答成“合理负担”等。由此看来，小学教员的政治文化等程度如不设法提高，难以负起国民教育重大责任。领导上写了提高现任教员及培养新教员，特于九月成立了短期师范学校，一面招收新生培养新的师资（学习期限为一年），另一面轮训现任教员，提高其文化、政治水平（每期三个月）。采取集中抽调重点教育的方法，什么课程差就调什么人来受训。此外还要加强在职教员的日常学习，每天坚持两小时的学习制度，由政府统一布置学习内容，并定期测验。
