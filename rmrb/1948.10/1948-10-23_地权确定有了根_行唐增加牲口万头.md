　　Land Ownership Determined, Roots Established
  　Xingtang Increases Livestock by Ten Thousand Head
    [North Yue News] After the end of land reform and the announcement of the policy of determining land ownership, the production enthusiasm of the masses in Xingtang has greatly increased. Zheng Laoshuang, the head of the poor peasant group in Yantou Village, Fourth District, said, "Now that land ownership is determined and we have roots, we must work hard!" This year he will plant six mu of wheat, applying nine large carts of fertilizer per mu; he has already accumulated four circles of fertilizer. Under his influence, the village will plant one-third more wheat than last year, with an average of eight large carts of fertilizer applied per mu. The women in the village have also dug five cellars early (each with fifteen spinning wheels), participating in agricultural production during the day and spinning yarn at night, and are preparing to vigorously develop sideline occupations this winter. In Dong＠＠ Village, Seventh District, 352 mu of wheat were planted last year; this year, 700 mu will be planted, with an average of nine large carts of fertilizer applied per mu. Xiao Luobao, a middle peasant in Qihou Village, Third District, did not accept land during the distribution, but this time he also requested to plant a few more mu. The landlords and rich peasants in various places have also started their labor lives under the supervision of the masses. Due to the increased enthusiasm of the masses, livestock have also greatly increased in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. According to statistics in March, the county had only 7,253 donkeys, 1,602 mules, 2,309 cattle, and 118 horses, totaling 11,282 head; while according to a survey in September, the number has increased to 14,325 donkeys, 2,716 mules, 4,266 cattle, and 177 horses, totaling 21,484 head, an increase of nearly one-fold.

　　地权确定有了根
  　行唐增加牲口万头
    【北岳讯】土改结束确定地权政策公布后，行唐各地群众生产情绪大为提高。四区燕头村贫农团长郑老双说：“地权确定有了根，这得好好干哩！”今年他要种麦六亩，每亩要施肥九大车；现已积肥四圈。在他影响下，全村今年种麦超过去年三分之一，每亩平均施肥八大车。该村妇女们也早早挖好了五个窨子（每个有十五辆纺车），白天参加农业生产，晚上纺纱，并准备今冬大力开展副业。七区东＠＠村，去年种麦三五二亩；今年要种七百亩，每亩平均施肥九大车。三区祁后村中农萧洛保，平分时不接受土地，这次也要求多种几亩。各地土改后的地富也在群众的督促下开始了劳动生活。由于群众情绪增高，在秋收种麦中各地牲畜也大量增加。三月份统计，全县仅有驴七千二百五十三头，骡一千六百零二头，牛二千三百零九，马一百一十八，共计一万一千二百八十二头；而九月份调查，已增到驴一万四千三百二十五头，骡二千七百一十六匹，牛四千二百六十六头，马一百七十七匹，共计二万一千四百八十四头，增加将近一倍。
