The North China People's Government Issues Instructions to Do a Good Job in Winter Loan Work

[This newspaper's dispatch] The North China People's Government recently issued instructions on winter production loans. The full text is as follows: This winter's production loans are being carried out in a situation where land reform has been largely completed throughout the region, and production, party rectification, and government building are underway. The following instructions are given on the main issues in the loan work: 1. The purpose and object of the loan: The loan is for the purpose of developing production and achieving the goal of "increasing agricultural production by an inch on the existing basis." Therefore, loans can only be used to solve the difficulties and needs of the working people in production (such as production tools, funds, etc.). At the same time, loans must be borrowed and repaid, and must be repaid on time. Loans are not for relief, so we must thoroughly oppose and correct the past loan work's point of view of granting and relieving from the perspective of living difficulties and from the perspective of class origin, as well as the one-sided point of view of the poor and hired peasants. That is, regardless of whether they are engaged in production, as long as they are poor and have good class origin, they can get loans (this bias was more serious in last winter's loans). We must also correct the fact that after the loans are issued, they are not actively collected, and as a result, some loans become disaster relief funds, which is harmful to the development of production.

The object of the loan is all working people who are actively engaged in production. All people in the countryside, regardless of their class origin, have the same right to obtain loans as long as they are engaged in production, such as poor peasants, middle peasants, handicraft workers, and landlords and old-style rich peasants who have switched to labor in areas where land reform is thorough. As for the amount of the loan, and the order in which it is obtained, and the level of interest, in addition to generally considering the difficulties and needs of the producers, we must also take into account the type of production and whether it is in line with the production undertakings promoted by the government, such as this winter we advocate well digging, repairing waterwheels, breeding livestock, etc. Those engaged in this type of production can get loans first.

2. Interest policy: In the past, bank loan interest rates were very low, generally 1% to 2% per month (calculated in currency). From the perspective of the overall long-term interests, too low interest rates are not conducive to the development of production. During the war, prices rose, and if bank loan funds are calculated in kind, they will lose money year by year, which weakens the power to support production. If a large amount of issuance is used to make up for it, it will inevitably lead to price increases, which is also not conducive to the development of production. At the same time, too low bank loan interest rates affect the inability of rural private lending to develop, resulting in financial stagnation.

Our current agricultural loan interest rate policy is the principle of "developing production, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both public and private." That is, on the one hand, the loan enables the masses to benefit from production, and on the other hand, the state bank loan funds must be able to maintain their value when calculated in kind, and must be profitable in the future, so that the state capital can gradually accumulate and grow, and have the power to help the masses carry out expanded reproduction. In order to ensure that the loan maintains its value, we can adopt methods such as lending in kind and repaying in kind, lending in terms of the value of goods (converting several major materials, such as rice, wheat, cotton, etc.), and increasing interest rates on loans and repayments.

The interest rate for this winter's production loan is set as follows: 0.5% to 1% per month for lending in kind and converting the value of goods, and 5% to 10% per month for loans. Recent experience in various places has proved that lending in terms of the value of goods is supported by the majority of the masses, who believe that it is "not a loss to either party." However, when it is first implemented, the masses do not understand lending in kind, and some people have the idea of "taking advantage of the public," and the phenomenon of not daring to lend in kind and convert the value of goods occurs. As long as we strengthen propaganda and education to the masses, this problem can be solved.

3. Actively collect old loans. The government has decided not to increase agricultural loan funds this winter. All overdue loans must be recovered and distributed in winter production. Therefore, governments at all levels must first recognize the importance of collecting old loans. In the past, due to the lack of a clear production perspective in our loan policy, and the long-standing concept of granting and relief in the minds of cadres, most loans could not be recovered on time. According to bank statistics, the number of overdue loans not recovered accounts for 50% of all agricultural loan funds. The main link in collecting old loans this winter is to first solve some of the wrong ideas existing in the leading organs and cadres of local governments. Some district and county governments believe that "collecting old loans is the work of the bank," and they do not pay attention to it, and do not arrange it in the entire production work. There is a common misconception among cadres that "they are willing to issue loans but not willing to collect loans." They believe that "issuing loans is to seek benefits for the masses, and collecting loans is not in line with the mass viewpoint." Some people say: "It is not good for the bank to ask the masses for money," and even say to the masses: "You can repay if you can, and you don't have to repay if you can't." Some people follow the tail of backward masses and ask the leadership to "be lenient and delay." We must understand that loan work is an important part of production work. This is not only the work of the bank, but also the common task of cadres engaged in production. In leading the winter production work, we must seize the collection of old loans, and we must recover all overdue loans, which has a direct significance for carrying out the large-scale production movement next year. Secondly, some of the masses have the idea that "lending grain and loans is relief and they are unwilling to repay." We must publicize and explain the loan policy to them and change this wrong understanding.

The above-mentioned loan issues must be universally educated among cadres so that everyone can grasp the loan policy. This is the main key to doing a good job in this winter's loan work.

4. Rectify and pilot rural credit cooperation work. In addition to state bank loans, we must also actively develop mass lending to solve the problem of production funds for the masses. We must recognize that mass funds are much larger than bank loans. Establishing credit departments (cooperatives) is the main way to organize mass mutual lending. In the past, there were some credit departments in Taihang and Taiyue, but most of them were part of the business of cooperatives. With the collapse of some cooperatives, credit business also stopped. This winter, we must rectify the cooperatives in production, restore the credit business, and make it truly a credit institution of the masses themselves. In the bank's issuance of loans in kind, it is easy to combine with the organization of credit departments. In areas where there are no credit departments, we must also select key areas and pilot them in a planned way. The basic experience of organizing credit departments (cooperatives) is to correctly implement the policy of "developing production and mass voluntarism," that is, how to enable both borrowers and lenders, those who provide labor and those who provide capital, to benefit on the basis of developing production. In the past, some credit cooperatives collapsed because the masses requested to withdraw deposits and withdraw shares. The main reason was that prices rose, and the interest rate on loans was too low, and the interest or dividends obtained from deposits were lost when calculated in kind, that is, the policy was not implemented.

5. This year's winter production is to prepare for next year's large-scale production movement. What is the production plan for each locality next year? What is the loan plan? We must prepare this winter. We must conduct necessary investigations on the local agriculture, sideline industry, and handicraft industry, so that we can conduct planned production loans and support production next year.

### 华北人民政府发布指示　做好冬季贷款工作

　　华北人民政府发布指示
  　做好冬季贷款工作
    【本报讯】华北人民政府顷发布关于冬季生产贷款的指示，全文如下：今冬的生产贷款，是在全区土改大部完成，进行生产、整党、建政的情况下来进行的。对货款工作中的主要问题，作如下指示：一、贷款的目的和对象：贷款是为了发展生产，达到“把农业生产在现有基础上提高一寸”的目的。因此只能把贷款用于解决劳动人民生产中的困难与需要（如生产工具、资金等），同时贷款必须有借有还，并要按期归还。贷款不是为了救济，因此必须彻底反对与纠正过去贷款工作中从生活困难出发，从成份出发的恩赐救济观点和片面贫雇观点。那就是不论是否从事生产，只要生活贫苦和成份好都能得到贷款（去冬贷款中这一偏向较严重）。也要纠正贷款发放后，不积极催收，结果有些贷款变成赈款，这对发展生产是有害的。
    贷款的对象是一切积极生产的劳动人民。乡村中一切人民，不论其阶级成份如何，只要进行生产，都有获得贷款的同等权利，如贫农，中农，手工业工人和土改彻底地区的转入劳动的地主旧式富农等，至于贷款数量多少，和得到的先后，利息之高低，除一般根据生产者的困难与需要外，还要照顾生产的种类，与政府提倡的生产事业符合与否而有所区别，如冬季我们提倡打井，修水车，繁殖牲口等，凡从事这种生产者，则可优先得到贷款。
    二、利息政策：过去银行贷款利息甚低，一般是月利一分至二分（按货币计算），从整个的长远利益来看，利息太低，对发展生产不利。战争时期物价上涨，银行贷款资金若按实物计算，逐年亏损，这就削弱了扶助生产的力量，若用大量发行来弥补，势必引起物价上涨，这对发展生产也是不利的；同时银行贷款利息太低，影响农村私人借贷不能开展，造成金融死滞现象。
    现在我们农贷的利息政策是“发展生产，公私兼顾，公私两利”的方针。即贷款一方面使群众生产得利，同时国家银行贷款资金，按实物计算必须能保本，而且将来必须有利，这样国家资本才能逐渐积累壮大，才有力量扶助群众进行扩大再生产。为了作到贷款保本，可以采用贷实物还实物，贷款折实物（折几种主要物资，如米，麦，棉花等），贷款还款提高利息等办法。
    今冬生产贷款利息这样规定：贷实和折实月利五厘至一分，贷款月利五分至十分。最近各地经验证明，贷款折实是多数群众拥护的，认为是“两不吃亏”。但开始实行时，群众对贷实不了解，加上少数人有“占公家便宜”的思想，而发生不敢贷实折实的现象，只要加强对群众的宣传教育，这一问题即可解决。
    三、积极催收旧贷款，今冬农贷资金政府决定不再增加，必须将过去到期贷款全部收回，在冬季生产中发放，因此各级政府首先要认识催收旧贷的重要性。过去由于我们贷款政策中的生产观点不够明确，和干部思想中长期存在着恩赐救济观点，因此使大部分贷款不能按期收回，据银行统计，到期贷款未收回数目占全部农贷资金百分之五十。今冬催收旧贷的主要环节，首先必须解决各地政府领导机关和干部中存在着的某些错误思想，有些区县政府认为：“催收旧贷是银行的工作”，而自己不加重视，不把它布置在整个生产工作中去进行。干部中普遍存在着“愿放贷款不愿收贷款”的错误思想。他们认为“放贷款是给群众谋利益的，收贷款是没有群众观点”。有的说：“银行向群众要款是不好的事”，甚至对群众说：能还就还，不能还可以不还，有的当落后群众的尾巴，要求领导上“宽恩缓”。我们必须了解贷款工作，是生产工作中的重要部分。这不仅是银行的工作，而是进行生产干部的共同任务。在领导冬季生产工作中，必须抓紧催收旧贷，要把到期贷款全部收回，这对明年开展大生产运动有直接意义。其次在有些群众中，存在着“贷粮贷款是救济，不愿归还”的思想，必须对他们宣传解释贷款政策，改变这种错误认识。
    上述贷款中的若干问题，必须在干部中普遍进行教育，使大家都能掌握贷款政策，这是今冬贷款工作做好的主要关键。
    四、整顿与试办农村信用合作工作。解决群众生产资金困难的办法，除国家银行贷款外，还要积极开展群众性的借贷，我们必须认识群众资金比银行贷款大得多，建立信用部（社）是组织群众互相借贷的主要办法。过去太行、太岳等地，都有一些信用部，但他们大多是合作社业务的一部分，随着某些合作社的垮台，信用业务也停顿了。今冬生产中要整顿合作社，必须把信用业务恢复起来，使他真正成为群众自己的信贷机构。在银行发放贷款贷实中，很容易和组织信用部结合起来，没有信用部的地区，也要选择重点有计划的试办。组织信用部（社）的基本经验，是正确执行“发展生产，群众自愿”的方针，即如何在发展生产基础上，使借贷双方，出劳力与出资本的都能得到利益。过去有些信用社群众要求提取存款和抽股金而垮台，其原因主要由于物价上涨，对放款利息太低，存款所得利息或红利按实物计算赔本所致，也就是没有执行政策所致。
    五、今年的冬季生产，是为明年大生产运动作准备的，各地明年的生产计划如何？贷款计划如何？要在今冬进行准备，必须对当地的农业、副业、手工业情况进行必要的调查，以便明年有计划的进行发放生产贷款扶助生产。
