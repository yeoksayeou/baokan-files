Taiyue Telegraph: This year's wheat yellow dwarf disease is serious in Taiyue. To prevent the disease next year, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily issued a short commentary calling for wheat seed disinfection. It also published news about Jincheng organizing seed selection. According to a report from the Jincheng District Chief meeting, villages such as Qilingdian in the Fifth District are using salt water to soak and wash wheat seeds, but most villagers reflected: "This year's wheat disaster is God's will. We don't know if this method will work." Some said: "We are still eating sweet meals, do we still have salt to wash wheat!" Some said: "Soaking wheat seeds in salt water, I'm afraid they will be damaged by the salt water!" Therefore, seed disinfection has not been well implemented in most areas. To address these ideas of the masses, use the following practical examples to resolve them: For example, Mu Chouzi of Qilingdian had some wheat seeds with yellow dwarf disease last year. Who knew that all nine mu of wheat would be completely affected by yellow dwarf disease this year. It also introduced a booklet on "Wheat Disease Prevention and Control Methods." This broke the masses' doubts. For those who are afraid of wasting salt, calculate the big picture for them. For example, Lu Chunsheng of Qilingdian planted seven mu of wheat, which was completely affected by yellow dwarf disease this year. He didn't get to eat any, and the whole family was angry. The old man told his wife to take the children to flee the famine. If these seven mu were not ruined, each mu would yield seven dou, seven mu would yield four shi and nine dou, ten jin of water would use three jin of salt, and three jin of salt would sell for 1,500 yuan, which would not even cost the money for five sheng of wheat. This will clear the masses' thinking of losing big due to saving small.

　　太岳新华日报号召麦种消毒
    【太岳电】太岳今年麦子黄黑疸病严重，为防止明年病害，太岳新华日报特发短论号召麦种消毒。并刊载了晋城组织选种新闻。据晋城区长会议汇报，五区七岭店等村正在用盐水浸种淘麦，但大部分村的老百姓反映：“今年麦受了灾是天意，这办法还不知顶事不顶事。”有的说：“咱吃的还是甜饭啦，还有盐去淘麦！”有的说：“麦籽用盐水泡，恐怕被盐水浸坏了！”因之大部地区对麦种消毒没很好的搞起来。针对群众这种想法，用下面实际例子解决：如七岭店慕丑字去年种的麦籽里就有一些黑疸的，谁知今年九亩麦就完全黑疸了。又介绍了“麦子病害防治法”小册子。这样就打破了群众的怀疑。对于怕费盐的，就给他算算大帐。如：七岭店鲁春生种了七亩麦，今年完全黑疸了，没吃上，全家生气，老汉叫老婆抱孩子去逃荒。这七亩如果不坏，一亩地打七斗，七亩地打四石九，十斤水用上三斤盐，三斤盐卖上一千五百元，连五升麦的钱也用不了。这样就可打通群众因小失大的思想。
