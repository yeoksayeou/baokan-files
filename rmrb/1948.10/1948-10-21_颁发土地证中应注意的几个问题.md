　　Several Issues to Note in Issuing Land Certificates

　　[Our Newspaper] A summary of reports from Fanshi, Huolu, Pingshan and other counties in the North Yue District regarding the issuance of land certificates indicates that, upon completion of land reform and during the issuance of land certificates, in addition to correctly publicizing land policies to dispel the masses' ideological concerns and establishing unified land certificate issuance committees and other organizations, special attention should be paid to the following issues: (1) For land whose acreage is considered inaccurate by ordinary farmers or themselves, the measurement should be accurate. However, a comprehensive large-scale measurement should not be easily undertaken. This would not only prolong the process and waste manpower but has also caused many disputes. If a comprehensive measurement is truly necessary, it should only be done through a focused measurement approach, selecting various types of land that are representative of general land conditions. (2) When registering and measuring land, the masses should be encouraged to report hidden land, explaining that "if one person conceals land, everyone suffers." It should be pointed out that past false reports and concealments, if now reported truthfully, will not be investigated, and it should be emphasized that if land is deliberately concealed again, penalties will be imposed upon discovery in the future. This breaks the old habit of false reporting, underreporting, and concealing, so that the actual acreage is generally accurate. (3) Concretely resolve the remaining issues from land reform. According to existing materials, these include land boundary disputes, the need for compensation and resettlement, or issues of unfair distribution causing public dissatisfaction. These issues must be appropriately resolved. The solutions are: general problems should be resolved by the committee, and issues that are too entangled or of significant importance should be discussed and decided by the People's Congress. However, when resolving these issues, the main problems should be addressed first. (4) Before filling out the land certificates, if the masses are willing to freely exchange land with each other, they can be enabled to consolidate each family's land as much as possible, which is beneficial for production. In the past, many farmers' land was too fragmented, wasting too much labor. Consolidation offers many conveniences. (5) After the land certificates are issued, the government should declare clearly that the land will not be changed again in the future, to stabilize the emotions of the masses of all classes. The land certificate has legal effect, and it will be the basis for resolving land issues in the future, encouraging the masses to concentrate on production and become prosperous.

　　颁发土地证中应注意的几个问题
    【本报讯】综合北岳区繁峙、获鹿、平山等县几个村颁发土地证的报导，在结束土改，颁发土地证时，除正确宣传土地政策，应解除群众思想顾虑，及建立统一的颁发土地证委员会等组织外，还应特别注意以下几个问题：（一）对一般农民或本人认为亩数不确的土地，丈量应该确实。但不可轻易进行全面大丈量。这不但会延长时间，浪费人力，而且曾发生很多纠纷。如实有全面丈量之必要时，也只能采取重点丈量办法，选择能代表一般土地的各种类型地丈量一下。（二）在登记丈量土地时，应号召群众自报黑地，说明“一人瞒地大家吃亏”，指出过去虚报，匿报地现在实报出来不究已往，强调说明如再故意瞒地日后查出要受处罚。这样打破了过去假报、虚报、匿报旧习惯，使实有地亩得到大体确实的数目。（三）具体解决土改遗留问题。根据现有材料，其中有地界纠纷，有需要补偿安置的，或分配不公群众不满的等问题。这些问题均须求得适当解决，解决的办法是：一般问题由委员会解决，纠葛太多，关系重大的由人代会讨论决定，但解决时要先抓主要问题。（四）在填写土地证以前，如群众愿互相自由兑换土地，可使各家土地尽可能兑在一块，这样对于生产是有好处的。过去不少农民的土地太碎，误工太多，兑在一起有许多方便。（五）土地证颁发后，政府应明文宣布今后土地再不变动，以安定各阶层群众情绪。土地证有法律效用，以后解决土地问题以此证为据，鼓舞群众安心生产，发家致富。
