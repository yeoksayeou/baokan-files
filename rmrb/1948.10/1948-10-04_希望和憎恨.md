　　Hope and Hatred
    Han Jun
    “Once the rooster crows, get out of bed; twice the rooster crows, listen for gunfire; three times the rooster crows, no gunfire today, no hope for the day.”
    This folk rhyme, since the People's Liberation Army captured Tangyin last spring and annihilated Sun Dianying, began to appear among the masses in Anyang City, which was occupied by the Kuomintang bandit army. They eagerly hoped that the People's Liberation Army, led by the Chinese Communist Party, would liberate Anyang City as soon as possible.
    For a year, the Kuomintang bandit army entrenched in Anyang, lacking food and reinforcements, only intensified its exploitation of the people in the Anyang area. By this spring, they had squeezed the people dry; in April, rumors spread that the 40th Division of the Kuomintang bandit army, trapped in Anyang, was about to retreat. Those bandits who exploited the people for the benefit of Chiang Kai-shek were afraid that after this emaciated 40th Division, which supported Anyang, retreated, they would be even less able to rule Anyang City. So, they played the role of the so-called Anyang County Council and deceived the masses, saying they would release grain and asked the masses to go to the council to collect it. But none of the young and middle-aged dared to go; only a few old men and women were deceived. They announced that they wanted the masses to join them in "persuading the 40th Division to stay." The old men and women immediately cursed in low voices: "You invited us old folks here to do this! What good has the 40th Division done? Why keep it here! The Japanese had a 'Three Alls' policy in China [kill all, burn all, loot all], and the 40th Division in Anyang City has a 'Six Alls' policy: raping all the young women and daughters-in-law, capturing all the able-bodied men, demolishing all the houses, sawing down all the trees, looting all the grain, and starving all the old men and women to death. And you want us to persuade them to stay! The more they stay, the more we lose everything!" The old folks, filled with anger, quietly slipped away; three old men who knew each other whispered to each other: "The only way to avoid losing everything is for the Communist Party to liberate Anyang!" "If the Communist Party doesn't come, we'll go find the Communist Party!" So, this spring, many people fled from Anyang to sell scraps near Shuiye. When they talked to the masses in the liberated areas, they poured out endless grievances. The old folks who couldn't escape prayed every day: "We kowtow diligently and burn incense frequently, and our whole family is hoping for you, old man Communist Party!"
    This year, during the wheat harvest, some refugees who had fled from Anyang still had some wheat planted last year, and they rushed back to harvest it. But as soon as the wheat was ripe, the Kuomintang bandits' county government openly announced: "One yuan of Ding Yang is levied for 150 jin of summer military grain and 20 jin of township grain, regardless of whether it is barren land or wheat land." The military grain given to Chiang Kai-shek was weighed on a heavy scale; they said how much it was, and that's how much it was. A small village near the city, Xiyangdian, sent 1,161 jin of wheat, and more than 200 jin were deducted as soon as it was weighed. A lot was deducted from the military grain collected from other streets and villages. The people had to hand over all the wheat they harvested and it still wasn't enough. Three people in Mazhuang were shot by the Kuomintang bandits because they couldn't pay the wheat. Shen Defu, a middle peasant in Wuduying Village, only planted 2.7 mu of wheat. The Kuomintang bandits harvested all of it, but it still wasn't enough. They took all the furniture, clothes, quilts, etc., and gave them to Chiang Kai-shek as payment for the military grain. With nothing left in the house, he had no choice but to pick up two baskets and lead his family out to find the Communist Party again. When he passed through the Kuomintang bandit army's blockade line, the bandit army's sentry stopped him from crossing. He said to the bandit army: "I have nothing left at home. If you feed me, I won't leave." The bandit army kicked him twice and cursed: "What kind of army feeds the people? Get the hell out of here!" Shen Defu fled to the liberated area, and when he talked to the masses about the situation of going back to harvest the wheat, he cried and fainted. The masses in the liberated area brought out rice soup and white steamed buns for him to eat, and only then did they save him. He gritted his teeth and said: "When Anyang is attacked, if I don't go with the People's Liberation Army to vent this anger, I'm not my mother's son!"
    The Kuomintang bandit army was not only so cruel and tyrannical to the general people, but also to the general landlords and rich peasants without exception. The landlords near the city complained to each other: "With this 'Suffering Army' [common name for the Central Army] here, handing over all the wheat we harvest isn't enough, and we have to pay money, and we have to buy guns. How can we live? The Communist Party should liberate Anyang soon. The Communist Party's Land Law Outline stipulates that we also get a share!" Xiao Qingyuan, a rich peasant in Beixinan Village, had his child captured by Chiang Kai-shek to be a soldier. All the wheat he harvested this year was handed over, but it still wasn't enough. He had to make up for it with money, and he died of anger. His wife also went crazy with anger, but the Kuomintang bandits still forced him to pay. Therefore, in the Kuomintang-controlled area of Anyang, whether it was the masses or the general landlords and rich peasants, they all unanimously hoped that the gunfire of the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party would soon reach Anyang and liberate Anyang City.
    The Chiang bandits, fearing that they would not be able to collect all the people's grain, also carried out frantic looting and searched the people clean. When the bandit army's 40th Division, combined with more than a thousand local bandits, went to Zuo Village to rob wheat, the people's wheat in the fields had not yet been threshed. The bandit army could not take it all away at once, so they set it on fire, also burning down more than 60 houses, raping many women, and stabbing several children to death. Before leaving, they looted wildly. Out of the 70-odd households in the entire village, more than 50 households were looted clean. Twenty-seven able-bodied men were captured, and 47 head of livestock were taken away. Other losses of clothes, bedding, etc., could not be counted. So, in the Kuomintang-controlled area of Anyang, the following folk rhyme appeared again:
    "The Suffering Army is shrouded in fog, those jackals are fiercely menacing. Before setting out, they first grab the people, no need to ask, they are robbing grain and grabbing recruits. Forcing us to carry sacks and shoulder poles, to rob grain to maintain their dying breath. Most terrifying is when the artillery fire sounds and they use us as shields, our parents and wives wail in grief. We are just waiting for the People's Liberation Army to break through Anyang, and when we catch those bastards, we will settle the score."

　　希望和憎恨
    寒军
    “鸡叫一遍把床起，鸡叫二遍听枪声，鸡叫三遍枪不响，今日一天无希望。”
    这个民谣，自从去年春天人民解放军打下汤阴，歼灭孙殿英时，就开始出现在国民党匪军盘踞的安阳城关群众中间。他们热切的希望着中国共产党领导的人民解放军，能赶快把安阳城也解放了。
    一年以来，盘踞在安阳的国民党匪军，内无粮草，外无援兵，只有更加紧榨取安阳地区的老百姓。到今年春天，已经把老百姓榨取得再无法榨取了；四月间就传出，困守安阳的国民党匪军，整编四十师要撤退的谣言。那些替蒋匪榨取老百姓的土匪们，怕国民党匪帮支持安阳的这个瘦骨架子四十师撤退以后，他们更无力统治安阳城，于是扮演了所谓安阳的县参议会，欺骗群众说他们要放粮啦，叫群众到参议会去领粮。可是青壮年谁也不敢去，只有一部分老汉老婆们被欺骗去了。他们一宣布要群众和他们一块去“挽留四十师”。老汉老婆们马上就低声乱骂起来：“把老爷爷老奶奶请来，原来是干这事哩！四十师办啥好事啦？为啥留它！日本在中国是三光政策，四十师在安阳城是六光政策：把大闺女小媳妇都强奸光，把壮丁抓光，把房子拆光，把树木锯光，把粮食抢光，把老头老婆都饿死光。还挽留哩！越挽留越光！”老头老婆们闷着满肚子气，悄悄都溜走了；有三个知己的老汉互相低语道：“要想不光，只有共产党来解放安阳！”“共产党若不来，咱去找共产党！”所以今年春天从安阳逃出来，到水冶一带卖破烂东西的很多。他们一和解放区的群众谈起来，就是倒不尽的苦水。逃不出来的老头老婆们则每天祷告着：“勤磕头，多烧香，我们一家老小盼望着您老人家共产党！”
    今年麦收时，有些安阳逃出来的难民家里去年还种了一些麦子，他们都慌着回去收麦。可是麦子刚熟，国民党匪帮的县政府即公开宣布：“一元丁洋征收夏季军粮一百五十斤、乡公所粮二十斤，不管白地与麦地都得出。”给蒋匪交军粮是大秤收，他们说多少就是多少。城附近的西羊店一个小庄送去一千一百六十一斤麦子，一过秤就脱了二百多斤，其他各街各村被征收的军粮都脱的很多。老百姓把打的麦子全交了都不够。马庄三个老百姓因为交不起麦子，被国民党匪帮枪毙了，五都营村中农申得福只种了二亩七分麦子，被国民党匪帮全割了去还不够，把全部家具、衣服、被子等都交给蒋匪抵当了军粮。家里一点东西都没有了，最后只有挑起两个篓子，引着一家老小又出去找共产党。当他经过国民党匪军的封锁线时，匪军的哨兵挡住他不让他过来。他向匪军说：“我家里啥也没有了，你们要管我饭吃，我就不走了。”匪军踢了他两脚，骂道：“那还有军队管老百姓饭吃的？滚你妈的吧！”申得福逃到解放区，和群众一谈起回去收麦子的情形，就哭的晕过去。解放区群众端出米汤和白馍馍给他吃，才把他救过来。他咬着牙说：“打安阳时，我不和解放军一块去出出这口气，我不是娘养的！”
    国民党匪军不仅对一般老百姓是这样残忍暴虐，就是对一般地主富农也没有例外，城附近的地主们互相诉说着：“遭殃军（中央军的俗称）在这里，打下麦子全交给他也不够，出款也是咱，买枪也是咱，怎么能活呢？共产党快解放安阳吧，共产党的土地法大纲还规定分给咱一份呢！”北辛安村富农萧庆元的孩子被蒋匪抓去当了兵，今年收的麦子全交了还不够，还要用款子补，气死了，他的老婆也气疯了，可是国民党匪帮还是逼着要款。所以安阳国民党统治区不论是群众，也不论是一般地主富农，都是一致的希望共产党领导的人民解放军的枪声快些打到安阳，把安阳城解放了。
    蒋匪恐怕征不光老百姓的粮食，另外又进行疯狂的抢劫，把老百姓搜光。匪军四十师结合地方土蒋一千多人窜到左庄抢麦时，老百姓在场里的麦子还没有打，匪军一下子拿不了走，一把火烧光了，还烧掉房子六十多间，强奸了许多女人，刺死几个小孩。临走时大肆抢劫，全村七十多户，被抢光的就有五十多户。抓去壮丁二十七人，拉走牲口四十七头，其他衣服被衬等损失无法统计。于是在安阳国民党统治区又出现了以下一首民谣：
    “遭殃军雾气腾腾，那豺狼气势凶凶。未出发先抓百姓，不用问抢粮抓丁。强逼咱带上口袋扁担，抢粮食维持他垂死残生。最可怕炮火响拿咱顶命，咱父母和妻子大放悲声。单等着解放军攻破安阳，捉住了狗日们定把帐清。”
