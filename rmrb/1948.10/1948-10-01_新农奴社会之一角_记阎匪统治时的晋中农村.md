　　A Corner of the New Serf Society
　　——A Record of the Rural Jinzhong Under the Rule of the Bandit Yan
　　In the Yuci County area west of the Tongpu Railway, within the "hundred-mile circle" formerly ruled by the bandit Yan, the "integration of soldiers and farmers" has been thoroughly implemented. Therefore, the social form of the new serf system is most evident here.
　　"Good integration of soldiers and farmers means weeds everywhere." The fertile Jinzhong Plain has much land lying barren. According to statistics from the Yuci Democratic County Government, the area of wasteland in various villages in the newly liberated areas amounts to 15% to more than 50% of the arable land area.
　　From south of Yuci city, a small river flows westward, with fertile land on both banks, known as the "Little River Bend." According to the farmers, in the past, the general land here had to be plowed two or three times and weeded two or three times, and each mu of land could receive two large carts of manure. In ordinary years, medium-grade land could yield eight dou of wheat, one dan of corn, and one dan and five sheng of millet and sorghum per mu. What about now? Take the villagers Zhang Chouxi and Jia Xigui from Guojiabao, a so-called "model village" for "integration of soldiers and farmers," as examples: they "received" a total of ninety-seven mu of land, of which twenty-nine mu were barren, thirty-five mu were planted with wheat, and thirty-three mu were planted with autumn crops. Out of these thirty-three mu of autumn crops, a total of eight large carts of manure were applied, only four and a half mu of land were plowed twice, and the rest were plowed only once; twenty-five mu of land were weeded once, and the rest were not weeded at all. I asked them why they cultivated the land so poorly, and they replied: "We don't have time! We have to do corvée labor almost every day, at least twenty days a month. Besides, we don't have the heart to! If we harvest eight dou, they want one dan; what we harvest isn't even enough for them (referring to the bandit Yan)."
　　The bandit Yan's plunder of the people was endless. There were more than thirty types of plundering items in total. One farmer said: "There are more than seven hundred days a year when we have to hand over grain. They want it day and night."
　　For the endless plunder, the bandit Yan used all kinds of extremely cruel tortures, such as "hanging," "brick topping," "sitting on a bench," etc. "Hand over grain if you have it, hang yourself if you don't," the people now recall with a sense of horror. I had a conversation with the villagers of Guojiabao, and all eleven people present had been subjected to torture, most of them two or three times or more. When talking about these tortures, Ji Jilin suddenly knelt on the ground, raised both hands, and gestured, saying: "Two bricks on the head, two bricks on one palm, kneeling straight on the ground, this is called 'brick topping'." Regarding the bandit Yan's tyrannical rule, the unanimous conclusion of the people from all walks of life in Jinzhong is: "The poor simply cannot live, and the rich have no way to live either." Li Jibao, a landlord from Zhangqing Village, is now doing business in Xi'an. His old mother, wife, and children are left at home, hiring a farmhand to cultivate more than one qing of land. Last year, handing over all the grain was not enough, so he sold his livestock, sold his cart, and also dismantled and sold nine houses and forty mu of good land (last year, the "integration of soldiers and farmers" in the village was not thoroughly implemented, so he could still sell land; this year, all his land has been confiscated). In winter, the bandit Yan beat his eleven-year-old child to death in front of his mother in order to force grain. His wife died of anger in less than a month.
　　I visited Wangjiabao, which includes twenty-two households. From last spring to this spring, nine households in this small village dismantled and sold one hundred and forty-five houses in order to "hand over grain." This spring, four people starved to death, and now six households with eleven people have no food. I walked through the whole village, full of weeds, piles of manure everywhere, and stench coming from all directions. The village head introduced to me: "It's much better now. Before liberation, the weeds outside the courtyard were more than one person tall. After the People's Liberation Army came, the people cut the grass by the roadside and cleaned it up a bit."
　　Under the bloody rule of the bandit Yan's so-called "establishing iron villages and completing iron politics," the people's only task was to be serfs. Ma Min, a farmer in Yanwu Village, "received" a piece of land in the spring, but he had no food, drink, or bedding, and no way to cultivate it. Under the charges of being a "lazybones" and "colluding with bandits," he was asked to "rebirth" at a "free" assembly. After the whole village pleaded, he was not beaten to death on the spot. But less than five days later, he committed suicide by jumping into a well.
　　Since the Jinzhong Campaign began, the tragic fate of these serfs has begun to end. I have visited many farmers and had many long conversations. "Tell the brothers to quickly capture Taiyuan and arrest Yan Xishan!" They always end their tragic narratives with this angry cry. (Yuan Mingruan)

　　新农奴社会之一角
    ——记阎匪统治时的晋中农村
    同蒲路西的榆次县境，在阎匪过去统治的“百里圈”内，“兵农合一”已经彻底实行。因之新农奴制度的社会形态，在这里表现得最为明显。
    “兵农合一好，遍地是蒿草。”肥沃的晋中平原，许多土地荒芜了。据榆次民主县政府的统计，新解放区各村荒地面积达耕地面积百分之十五到百分之五十多。
    从榆次城南往西，流着一条小河，两岸土地肥沃，号称“小河套”。据农民们谈：过去这里一般土地，都要犁两、三遍，锄两、三遍，每亩地能上到两大车粪。普通年景中等地每亩能收麦八官斗，玉茭一官石，谷子和高粱一官石五。现在呢？以号称“兵农合一”“模范村”的郭家堡村民张臭喜与贾喜贵两户为例：他们共“领”了九十七亩地，其中荒了二十九亩，种着三十五亩麦地，三十三亩秋地。在这三十三亩秋地中，总共上了八大车粪，只有四亩半地犁了两遍，其余都只犁了一遍；有二十五亩地锄了一遍，其余则根本没有锄。我问他们为什么把地种得这样坏，他们回答着：“没功夫！成天做工事，每个月至少有二十天支差。再说没有心思了！打八斗，要一石，打下还不够人家（指阎匪）的。”
    阎匪对人民掠夺是没有止尽的。掠夺项目，总共有三十余种之多。一个农民说：“一年三百六十五天，就有七百多天要粮。白天要，黑夜也要。”
    为了没有止尽的掠夺，阎匪使用了各种极其残酷的刑法，如“上吊”、“顶砖”、“坐板凳”……等等。“有粮交粮，没粮上梁”，人民现在回忆起来，还有谈虎色变之感。我与郭家堡老乡们作过一次谈话，在座的十一个人，全部受过刑法，绝大多数在两、三次以上。在谈到这些刑法时，冀计林忽然跪到地下，举起两只手，比划着说：“头上两个砖，一个手掌上两个砖，直直的跪在地下，这就叫做‘顶砖’”。对于阎匪的暴政统治，晋中各阶层人民一致的结论是：“穷人根本不能活，富人也没有法子活。”张庆村地主李吉保，现在西安经商，家里留着老母亲，和老婆孩们，雇着一个长工，耕种一顷多地。去年交了全部粮食还不够，把牲口卖了，大车也卖了，还拆卖了九间房子和四十多亩好地（去年该村“兵农合一”没有彻底实行，因些还能卖地，到今年他家土地已被全部没收）。到了冬天，阎匪为着逼粮，在他母亲面前，把他一个十一岁的小孩打死了。不到一个月，他的老婆也气死了。
    我访问包括二十二户的王家堡，从去春到今春，为了“交粮”，这个小村有九户拆卖了一百四十五间房子。今年春天饿死了四个人，现在有六户十一口没有口粮。我把全村走了一遍，满院蒿草，到处粪堆，臭气从四面八方袭来。闾长向我介绍说：“现在好的多了。没解放以前，院子外面都是一人多高的蒿草。解放军来了，老百姓才把路边的草割了，又打扫了一下。”
    在阎匪所谓“建立铁村完成铁政”的血腥统治下，人民的任务只有一个——当农奴。演武村的农民马民，春天“领”了一份地，没有吃喝铺垫，没法子种。在“懒汉”“通匪”等罪名下，要他在“自由”大会上“转生”，经全村恳求，总算没有当场打死。但不到五天，他自己跳井自杀了。
    从晋中战役开始，这些农奴们的悲残命运开始结束了。我访问过不少农民，作过许多漫长的谈话。“告诉弟兄们，赶快打下太原，捉住阎锡山吧！”他们总是以这种愤怒的呼声结束悲惨的叙述。　　　　　　（袁明阮）
