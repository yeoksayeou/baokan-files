　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. TASS dispatch: Pyongyang Radio broadcast on the 10th a statement by the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Park Hon-yong, requesting the establishment of diplomatic and economic relations with friendly countries, stating: From the first day that the Korean people were liberated from nearly half a century of colonial oppression by Japanese imperialists, they began the struggle to swiftly and completely restore their political, economic, and cultural independence and national sovereignty. Despite repeated attempts by domestic reactionary forces supported by foreign reactionary forces to undermine the unity of our people, we have achieved great victories in democratic construction over the past three years. In order to strive for the early unification of the entire country into a single independent and democratic nation, our people held general elections in North and South Korea in August 1948, which were a free and legitimate expression of the will of our people. Based on the general election, a single legislative body, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been formed. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a program to strive for the complete independence of Korea and the establishment of a democratic nation, and is leading the Korean people forward along this path. On behalf of my government, I express the unanimous desire of the entire Korean people and specifically suggest to the governments of those democratic countries that wish to maintain normal relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to establish diplomatic and economic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. I believe that the establishment of such relations will not only be conducive to the rapid revival of the Korean nation and the restoration of national independence, but also to the consolidation of world peace and security.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. TASS dispatch: The Council of Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided on the 7th, in accordance with the resolution of the first session of the Supreme People's Assembly, to request the United Nations General Assembly to grant the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the opportunity to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue, and to request the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to grant the delegation an entry visa. The Council of Ministers has appointed the following government delegation: Head of the delegation, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Park Hon-yong, and members Hong Myong-hui (Deputy Prime Minister), Lee Yong (Minister of Urban Management), Park Jeong-ae (leader of the Democratic Women's Union), and Hong Ki-ju (leader of the North Korean Democratic Party). Foreign Minister Park Hon-yong has been ordered to send separate telegrams to United Nations Secretary-General Lie and Third General Assembly President Evatt, requesting participation in the discussion of the Korean issue. The telegram emphasized: "Any issue concerning a country should be discussed and resolved with the participation of the country's legitimate representatives."
