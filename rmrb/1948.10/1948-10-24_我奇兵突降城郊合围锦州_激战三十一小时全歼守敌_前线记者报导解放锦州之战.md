Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou Front, 22nd: A frontline reporter reports on the Jinzhou liberation campaign: The Northeast Field Army's campaign to capture Jinzhou, a strategic stronghold in the Liaoxi Corridor and a major supply base for the enemy in Northeast China, was victoriously completed at 6:00 PM on the 15th. This marks the first major victory for our Northeast troops after three months of military and political training, which has resulted in an unprecedented increase in combat effectiveness.

	At the start of this campaign, our army launched a simultaneous attack on the Tangshan-Yuguan and Yuguan-Jinzhou sections of the Beining Railway on September 12th, dividing and encircling the enemy along the line. On September 14th, we briefly captured Changli, pursued and annihilated fleeing enemies, and eliminated over 3,000 enemy soldiers who were reinforcing from Luanxian. In late September, our army launched a fierce attack on the Yuguan-Jinzhou section and the outskirts of Jinzhou. On the 28th and 29th, we successively captured Suizhong and Xingcheng, eliminating over 6,000 enemy soldiers from the Provisional 60th Division's 2nd Regiment and the 54th Army's directly subordinate regiments. At the same time, we surrounded Yi County, which served as Jinzhou's northern shield. In order to respond to the enemy in Yi County and flee south, the enemy in Jinzhou extended northward with the Provisional 22nd Division, Provisional 18th Division, and other units. Unexpectedly, our surprise troops descended directly on the outskirts of Jinzhou, annihilating most of two regiments of the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division. The remaining enemy hastily retreated into the city. Our army took advantage of the situation to successively capture the Jinzhou northern highlands of Wuxingtun and Baituhu, the Greater and Lesser Zijing Mountains in the east of the city, and the Tasha and Gaoqiao highlands in the southwest, threatening Huludao, cutting off the connection between Jinzhou and Jinxi, and controlling the Jinzhou West Suburbs airport with artillery fire. On October 1st, when we captured Yi County and completely annihilated the defending enemy's Provisional 20th Division, the various armies surrounded Jinzhou from all directions, and the enemy in the city was completely isolated.

	On October 9th, our army began to clear the enemy's outer strongholds in Jinzhou. In the five days up to the 13th, we successively captured the Nanshan south of the city and the area south of the Nü'er River, reoccupied Xiaozijing Mountain in the east of the city, and captured the heavily fortified areas of the water distribution pool, synthetic fuel plant, and Liaoxi Division Jinzhou Regiment area in the north of the city, directly approaching Jinzhou city.

	At that time, bandit Chiang Kai-shek, knowing that the gain or loss of Jinzhou was related to the safety of the entire Northeast bandit army, frantically traveled back and forth between Pingjin and Huludao, personally supervising the reinforcements by sea and land, attempting to rescue Jinzhou. On the Jinan front, in addition to all of the 54th Army and the Provisional 62nd Division from Jinxi, the enemy also transferred all of the 62nd Army and the 21st Division of the 92nd Army from the Changli-Luanxian section, and the Independent 95th Division from the vicinity of Tianjin, totaling nine divisions, to reinforce northward. On the Shenyang front, the enemy dispatched twelve divisions and three cavalry brigades from the New 1st Army, New 3rd Army, New 6th Army, 71st Army, and 49th Army to the west and north, but all were blocked by our army and unable to advance quickly. The enemy reinforcements coming from the Jinan front, with four divisions coming from Jinxi, launched a fierce battle with us from the 10th with naval and air coordination. Our heroic blocking troops relied on the Bohai Sea on the left and the Hongluo Mountains on the right, firmly defending the Tasha and Gaoqiao lines, resisting the invading enemy. In the fierce battle that lasted six days and nights, our commanders and fighters were tenacious and resolute, repeatedly engaging in bloody battles, and the reinforcements were unable to advance. The enemy's Provisional 62nd Division, which landed on Dayushan from the sea, was also repelled by our army. Our Tasha blocking position remained unshaken, leaving the nine enemy divisions only thirty to forty miles away from Jinzhou, lingering in frustration in the Hongluo Mountain - Tasha to Bohai coast area, unable to find a solution.

	Therefore, our siege troops gathered in the four suburbs of Jinzhou were able to complete thorough siege preparations, and launched a general attack on Jinzhou at 11:00 AM on the 14th. Under the fierce bombardment of our powerful artillery groups, the northern and southern armies bravely attacked and quickly completed the breakthrough, cutting the defending enemy in the city in half, dividing and encircling them. By 4:00 PM, most of the enemy in the west of the city had been eliminated and the western suburbs airport had been captured. Our army on the east side also broke through the four mountain ridges and entered the city. Due to our army's rapid, brave, and decisive actions, most of the enemy in the urban area was resolved by the morning of the 16th. More than 10,000 remaining enemies fled into the old city, stubbornly resisting. At 2:00 PM, our army attacked again, and resolved the entire battle by 6:00 PM. Thus, after thirty-one hours of fierce fighting, the Jinzhou defending enemy was completely annihilated, with no one escaping.

　　我奇兵突降城郊合围锦州
  　激战三十一小时全歼守敌
  　前线记者报导解放锦州之战
    【新华社锦州前线廿二日电】前线记者报导解放锦州战役经过称：东北野战军攻克辽西走廊战略重镇及东北敌军主要补给基地的锦州战役，已于十五日下午六时胜利完成。这是东北我军经三个月军事、政治整训后，战斗力空前提高后的首次大捷。
    此次战役之始，我军于九月十二日同时突向北宁路的唐（山）榆（关）段及榆（关）锦（州）段出击，分割包围沿线之敌。九月十四日，我一度克昌黎，并追歼逃敌及消灭由滦县东援之敌三千余。九月下旬，我军对榆（关）锦（州）段与锦州外围展开猛攻。二十八、二十九两日，连克绥中、兴城，歼两城守敌暂六十师第二团、五十四军直属团等部六千余。同时我包围作为锦州北面屏障的义县。锦州之敌为接应义县之敌南逃，乃以暂二十二师、暂十八师等部向北延伸。不意，我奇兵突降，直逼锦州城郊，歼敌暂二十二师两个团大部。余敌仓皇缩入城内。我军乘势先后攻占了锦州城北高地五姓屯、白老虎屯等处，城东之大小紫荆山，西南之塔山、高桥等高地，威胁葫芦岛，切断了锦州与锦西间的联系，并以炮火控制了锦州西郊机场。及十月一日我克义县，全歼守敌暂二十师后，各路大军乃四面八方向锦州合围，该城之敌已陷于完全孤立。
    十月九日，我军开始扫荡锦州敌外围据点，至十三日五天中，先后攻占了城南之南山及女儿河以南地区，城东重占小紫荆山，城北克配水池、合成燃料厂、辽西师管区锦州团管区等敌强固设防地带，直逼锦州城下。
    其时，蒋贼介石因知锦州得失关系整个东北匪军之安危，乃仓皇往返于平沈及葫芦岛之间，亲督援军海陆兼程，妄图援救锦州。锦南方面，敌除锦西之五十四军全部及暂六十二师外，复由昌（黎）滦（县）段调来六十二军全部及九十二军之二十一师，由天津附近调来独九十五师，共九个师兵力向北增援。沈阳方面，敌则以新一军、新三军、新六军、七十一军、四十九军等部十二个师与三个骑兵旅的兵力，向西向北出动，但均被我阻击，无法迅速前进。锦南方面来援之敌，自锦西出动四个师之众，以海空配合，从十日起与我展开猛烈之争夺战，我英勇阻击部队左凭渤海，右倚虹螺山，坚守塔山、高桥之线，抗击来犯之敌。在历时六昼夜之激战中，因我指战员顽强坚毅，反复浴血搏战，援敌无法前进。其由海上登陆打渔山之敌暂六十二师，亦为我军击退。我塔山阻击阵地始终屹然不动，使仅距锦州三、四十里外之九个师敌军徘徊沮丧于虹螺山——塔山至渤海岸地区而一筹莫展。
    因此，云集锦州四郊之我攻城部队乃得完成严密的攻城准备，于十四日上午十一时发起了对锦州城的总攻。在我强大炮兵群的猛烈轰击下，南北各路大军奋勇猛攻，迅速完成突破，将城内守敌拦腰斩断，各个分割包围，至下午四时，即将西城之敌大部肃清，攻占西郊机场。东面我军亦突破四道山梁，攻入城内。由于我军动作迅速、英勇果敢，至十六日上午，城区之敌即大部被我解决。残敌万余仓皇遁入旧城，负隅顽抗。下午二时，我军再次攻击，六时即全部解决战斗。至此，经三十一小时之激烈战斗后，锦州守敌乃告全歼，无一漏网。
