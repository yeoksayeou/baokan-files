　　The Question of Transforming Folk Art
　　Wang Yaping
　　I. From Investigation to Transformation
　　There are many folk artists and rich folk art in the Ji-Lu-Yu area. The folk artists include storytellers, opera performers, painters, and engravers, totaling about 4,500 people. They are scattered in the rural areas of Liaocheng, Dong'e, Dongping, ＠shan, Zhangqiu, Yanggu, Shouzhang, Fanxian, Chaocheng, Nanle, Guanxian, Shenxian, Tangyi, Guancheng, Yuncheng, and Linqing counties. From the perspective of folk art types, there are nine types of local opera: Peking Opera, Gao Diao, Ping Opera, Ben Zhao, Bangzi, String Opera, Flower Drum Opera, Liu Zi Opera, and Huai Diao. There are four types of storytelling: Zhui Zi, Luo Zi, Big Drum, and Yang Qin. There are four types of painting and engraving: painters, engravers, printers, and sculptors. There are three types of variety arts: magic lantern shows, juggling, and acrobatics with knives.
　　These artists are all from peasant backgrounds. In terms of class composition, 80-90% are extremely poor and poor peasants, and 10-20% are middle peasants.
　　Some of these artists came from other places, while others were born locally. The reason is that Ji-Lu-Yu is a large plain with abundant agricultural products, making it easy for artists from other places to make a living here; the local artists, in the old society, suffered deeply from the oppression of the landlord class. In addition, the Yellow River often breached its banks and caused disasters, so after years of labor, they could not get enough to eat, and had to learn some skills to make a living. The saying "Spending spring and autumn on both sides of the Yellow River" and "Traveling the world with a zhui zi" are precisely the spoken words created by the artists from their lives.
　　After our investigation, we understood the above situation, and we also determined our determination to transform folk artists and folk art. In the past two years, we have transformed the Minyou Theatre (Peking Opera) and the Minyi Theatre (Gao Diao). The two theater groups have 140 artists. The Folk Art Federation has held three training classes for artists, specializing in training storytellers, painters, engravers, and musicians, with more than 280 trainees. The Second Special District Cultural Troupe has held three training classes for artists, specializing in training drama and painting artists, with more than 240 trainees. The Yunju Artist Training Class has also trained and transformed 50 artists. In total, more than 710 artists have received training and initial transformation in the past two years.
　　After the transformation, the reformed troupes, such as Minyou Theatre, can perform new historical dramas, and the Minyi Theatre can perform dramas reflecting real life. The transformed drama, painting, and storytelling artists formed rural painting shops, professional theater troupes (voluntarily formed, without leaving production), and artist propaganda teams, performing, storytelling, painting New Year pictures, and murals everywhere, playing a significant role in revolutionary propaganda work. Other outstanding individual artists, such as Shen Guanying, have created fifteen storytelling scripts in the past two years and are now leading the work of the Folk Art Federation. Zhang Shoushen has painted three sets of magic lantern slides, more than a dozen New Year pictures, and hundreds of murals in the past two years, and is also leading the painters.
　　From this, we can see that folk artists and folk art can be transformed, and they will definitely be gradually transformed well. In the future, the direction of transformation is not only relying on us to transform them, but also carrying out the transformation work together with the artists under our correct leadership.
　　II. Improving Artists' Creativity
　　Folk artists have abundant creativity. Their skills, storytelling abilities, and acting skills have all undergone rigorous training and long-term practice. Once their thinking is transformed, they all like to learn creation.
　　In the past two years: storytelling artists have written thirty-five kinds of storytelling lyrics; drama artists have created seven scripts reflecting real life; painting artists have painted more than twenty kinds of New Year pictures, dozens of single-panel pictures, and more than twenty kinds of comic strip stories.
　　The content of these works includes land reform, anti-Chiang, anti-feudal superstition, singing praises of heroes and figures, mass life stories, war news reports, and propaganda policies. In terms of form, the storytelling artists adopted old tunes and some new language, mostly using seven-character rhymes, ten-character rhymes, and five-character rhymes, and sometimes mixing the three rhymes. Those with "cultural knowledge" (the artist's term for people with cultural knowledge) write with a pen, and those without cultural knowledge compose orally, with others writing on their behalf. In terms of painting, they mostly adopt Chinese painting methods and gradually learn new painting methods. In terms of drama, they mostly use spoken language of the spoken drama, plus the singing of Gao Diao. More popular among the masses are "Li Er Getting Rich," "Great Battle of Yanghu," "Opening the Seal" (Zhui Zi), "The Death of Ma Suyun," "Xidianzi" (script), "The Story of the Long March," "General Liu Bocheng Crossing the Yellow River" (New Year picture), etc.
　　These works all have serious shortcomings: such as the colors of the paintings are not bright, the composition is incorrect, and the painting method is craftsman-like; such as the storytelling lyrics are stiffly propagandizing policies, excessively exaggerating reality, and the language is not new; such as the drama scripts lack dramatic art, there is no development and climax of the plot, and the characters' personalities are not prominent and unified. We must help them study and improve, and gradually improve from the existing foundation.
　　The method of improvement: in addition to criticizing and summarizing their existing creations, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages, and improving the level of creation; intellectuals who can write and paint must approach them, help them write, and co-write with them. Gradually improve them from the practice of creation. Now in this year's New Year picture work, intellectual painting workers and painters discussed and processed the subject matter together, studied the composition and coloring. In less than three weeks, twenty-two New Year pictures have been painted, which is much more progress than last year. Other script and songbook writing also formed writing groups, and everyone learned to write together, absorbing each other's advantages, so that the artist's creation will surely be improved one step.
　　III. Ideological Transformation Must Be Combined with Business
　　The artist's thinking is very complicated. They grew up in a feudal society and have long been influenced by feudal art. However, they have always been despised and oppressed by landlords and the ruling class, and their lives are painful, so they demand transformation.
　　In the past two years, our method of transforming folk artists has been, first, ideological transformation. Adopted: (1) Pouring out grievances. (2) Frank confession and reflection, cutting off old tails. (3) Establishing a new outlook on life. (4) Resolving knots. (5) Making a plan of merit. Through these steps, we enlighten their class consciousness and call on them to turn over ideologically and serve the people. The second step is business transformation. In terms of painting, engraving, and printing, we start with transforming the code, then transforming New Year pictures, creating single-panel and comic strip stories, and developing to collective research and creation. In terms of storytelling, it is from the changes in lyrics and the coordination of musical instruments to the changes in form and writing zhui zi operas. In terms of drama: (1) from ideological transformation to learning business. (2) From jointly reviewing old scripts, improving their viewpoints. (3) From rehearsing new scripts, correcting the artists' shortcomings and improving their understanding of dramatic art.
　　This method of transforming folk artists and folk art has achieved considerable results. However, simply carrying out ideological transformation without combining it with business, their thinking will not be stable. Once they leave you, some still sing old lyrics, perform harmful feudal superstitious scripts, and paint old paintings. If we only carry out business transformation, it is easy to fall into formalism. Their lines, lyrics, and lines have been changed a little, but without combining with thought, they still cannot handle the subject matter and appropriately express new content. Therefore, in the future, to transform folk artists and folk art, we must combine ideological transformation with business, and then improve thinking through business. Through repeated research, comparing the new and the old, and mutually verifying, the transformed thoughts can be slowly consolidated and better developed in business learning; their business, under the constant awakening and improvement of their thoughts, can break through existing forms and create better works. Moreover, there are so many folk artists, and folk art is so rich and diverse in form. We cannot always follow them for transformation. Only under our correct leadership, by enlightening the artists' consciousness and cultivating relatively active and progressive elements, and working together with them to transform, can we achieve better results.

### 民间艺术改造问题

　　民间艺术改造问题
    王亚平
  　一、从调查到改造
    冀鲁豫的民间艺人很多，民间艺术很丰富。民间艺人有说唱、戏剧、画刻等，共约四千五百余人。散布在聊城、东阿、东平、＠山、张秋、阳谷、寿张、范县、朝城、南乐、冠县、莘县、堂邑、观城、郓城、临清各县的农村。从民间艺术类型上来看，地方戏有九种：平剧、高调、评戏、本找、梆子、弦子戏、花鼓戏、柳子戏、淮调。说唱有四种：坠子、落子、大鼓、洋琴。画刻有四种：画工、刻工、印工、雕塑。杂艺有三种：洋片、玩把戏、马戏刀山。
    这些艺人的出身，都是农民。成份，十分之八九是赤贫、贫农，十分之一二是中农。
    这些艺人有的来自外乡，有的生在本地。原因是冀鲁豫是一块大平原，农产物丰富，外乡的艺人容易到此地为生；本地的艺人，在旧社会，深受地主阶级的压迫，加上黄河常常决口成灾，长年劳动，不得一饱，就不得不学点手艺、口艺谋生糊口。所谓“黄河两岸度春秋”，“一根坠子走天下”，那正是艺人们从生活里创造出来的口语。
    经过我们的调查，了解了以上的情况，也决定了我们改造民间艺人、艺术的决心。两年来，我们改造了民友剧社（平剧）、民艺剧社（高调），两个剧社有一百四十名艺人。民间艺术联合会开过三次艺人训练班，专门训练说唱、画刻、音乐艺人，受训的有二百八十余人。二专署文工团开过三次艺人训练班，专门训练戏剧、画刻艺人，受训的二百四十余人。郓巨艺人训练班也训练、改造过五十名艺人。合计两年来受训得到初步改造的艺人有七百一十名以上。
    经过改造的剧团，民友剧社可以演新历史剧，民艺剧社可以演反映现实生活的戏。经过改造的戏剧、画刻、说唱艺人，组成了农村画店、职业剧团（自愿组成、不脱离生产）、艺人宣传大队，到处表演、说唱、画年画、墙画，对革命宣传工作起了不少作用。其他个别优秀的艺人如沈冠英，两年来创作了十五个说唱词本，今天正在领导民间艺术联合会的工作；张寿臣两年来，画了三套洋片，十几幅年画，百余幅墙画，也正在领导着画工。
    由此，我们可以看到民间艺人和民间艺术是可以改造，而且一定可以逐步改造好的。今后改造的方向，不只单单靠我们去改造他们，而是在我们正确领导下，和艺人共同去进行改造工作。
    二、提高艺人的创作
    民间艺人的创造力是很丰盛的，他们的手艺、口艺、演技，都经过严格训练，长久锻炼的，一旦思想改造，都欢喜学习创作。
    两年来：说唱艺人写了三十五种说唱词；戏剧艺人创作了七个反映现实生活的剧本；绘画艺人画了二十几种年画，几十种独幅，二十几种连环故事画。
    这些作品的内容，有的是土地改革，有的是反蒋，有的是反封建迷信，有的是歌颂英雄、人物，有的是群众生活故事，有的是战争活报，有的是宣传政策等。这些作品的形式，说唱方面是艺人采用了旧调，和一部分新语言写成的，多半用七字韵、十字韵、五字韵，有时也混合使用三种韵。有文化水（艺人称有文化知识人的口语）的用笔写，没文化水的用口编，别人代笔。绘画方面，多采用中国画法，逐渐学习新画法。戏剧方面，多用话剧的白、加上高调的唱写成。比较受群众欢迎的如“李二发家”“大战阳湖”“打开封”（坠子）“马素云之死”“西店子”（剧本）“长征故事”“刘伯承将军过黄河”（年画）等。
    这些作品都有严重的缺点：象绘画的颜色不鲜明，构图不正确，画法带匠气；象唱词的生硬的宣传政策，过分的夸大现实，语言不新颖；象剧本的缺乏戏剧艺术，没有剧情的发展、高潮，人物个性不突出、不统一。都必须帮助他们研究、改进，从现有基础上逐步提高。
    提高的方法：除把他们已有的创作加以批评、总结、指出优点、缺点、提高创作的水准外；能写作、绘画的知识分子，必须接近他们，帮助他们写，和他们合写。从创作的实践里逐步提高他们。如今年的年画工作，知识分子绘画工作者、画工，在一起共同商讨处理题材，研究构图、设色，不到三周的时间，已画成二十二幅年画，比去年进步多了。其他关于剧本、唱本的写作，也组成写作组，大家在一起学习写作，互相吸取优点，这样一定能够把艺人的创作提高一步。
    三、思想改造必须结合业务
    艺人的思想是很复杂的，他们生长在封建社会，长久的受封建艺术熏染。但他们一向被人卑视，受地主、统治阶级压迫，生活痛苦，自己要求改造。
    两年来，我们改造民间艺人的方法，第一步是思想改造。采用：（一）诉苦。（二）坦白反省、割掉旧尾巴。（三）树立新人生观。（四）解疙＠。（五）立功计划。通过这些步骤，启发他们的阶级觉悟，号召他们思想翻身，为人民服务。第二步是业务改造，在画、刻、印工方面是先从改造码子做起，进而改造年画，创作单幅及连环故事画，发展到集体研究、创作。在说唱方面，是从唱词的变化和乐器的配合，发展到变化形式，写坠子戏。戏剧方面是：（一）从思想改造诱导到学习业务。（二）从共同审查旧剧本，提高他们的观点。（三）从排演新剧本中，纠正了艺人的缺点，提高了对戏剧艺术的认识。
    这样改造民间艺人、艺术的方法，是收到了相当的效果。但单纯的进行思想改造，不结合业务，他们的思想不会稳固，一旦离开你，有的仍然唱旧词、演封建迷信有害的剧本，画旧画。如果单只进行业务改造，又容易流于形式主义，他们的线条、词句、台词改了一点，不结合思想，还是不会处理题材，适当的表现新内容。因此，今后改造民间艺人和民间艺术，必须使思想改造结合业务，再通过业务提高思想。这样反复研究，新旧比较，互相印证，已得到改造的思想，才能在业务学习中慢慢巩固、得到更好的开展；他们的业务，在他们的思想不断地觉悟、提高下，才能突破现有形式，创作出更好的作品。而且，民间艺人数目那末多，民间艺术又那末丰富、形式多样，我们不能永远跟着他们改造，只有在我们正确领导下，启发艺人的自觉，培养比较积极、进步的分子，和他们共同去改造，才能获得更好的效果。
