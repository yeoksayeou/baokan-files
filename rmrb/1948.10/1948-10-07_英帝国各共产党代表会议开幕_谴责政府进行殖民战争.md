Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Reports from various sources: Simultaneously with the British Colonial Office convening a conference of African colonies, the Communist Party of Great Britain convened a conference of Communist Parties representatives of the British Empire in London starting on October 2nd. The Deputy Chairman of the British Communist Party, Dutt, presided over the opening ceremony and delivered a speech stating: The liberation struggle of colonies around the world is a continuation of the liberation movement that began with the anti-fascist war. Colonial peoples today stand at the forefront of the world's democratic movement. The British Communist Party will strive to link the struggle for British people to improve their living conditions with the colonial countries' struggle for liberation. Dutt condemned the British imperialist colonial war in Malaya, as well as the Labor government's new war preparations; and pointed out that aggressive colonial wars are the crux of the British economic crisis. Four-fifths of Britain's trade deficit is due to excessive government spending abroad. Dutt stated that imperialism is another name for war, and the purpose of Britain's rearmament is to increase its military strength, so as to engage in war and suppress the people of Malaya, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Dutt concluded that the British Communist Party demands an end to the colonial war, the withdrawal of British troops from all colonies, and the liberation of all colonial peoples. Only in this way can Britain truly achieve security and economic recovery.

　　英帝国各共产党代表会议开幕
    谴责政府进行殖民战争
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：与英国殖民部召开非洲殖民地会议同时，英国共产党于十月二日起在伦敦召开英帝国各共产党代表会议。英共副主席杜德主持会议开幕式，并发表演说称：全世界殖民地的解放斗争，是以反法西斯战争开始的解放运动的继续，殖民地民族今天已站在世界民主运动的前列。英共将为争取英国人民改善生活条件的斗争与殖民地国家求解放的斗争联结起来而奋斗。杜德谴责英帝国主义在马来亚进行的殖民地战争，以及工党政府的新战争准备；并指出，侵略性的殖民地战争，是英国经济危机的症结所在。英国贸易之亏差，五分之四系因为政府在国外支出过巨。杜德申述帝国即战争之化名，英国重整军备之目的为增加军力，俾可从事战争及压制马来亚、东南亚、中东及非洲的人民。杜德末称，英共要求结束殖民地战争，撤退英国在各殖民地的军队，解放一切殖民地民族，只有这样，英国才可以真正获得安全及经济复原。
