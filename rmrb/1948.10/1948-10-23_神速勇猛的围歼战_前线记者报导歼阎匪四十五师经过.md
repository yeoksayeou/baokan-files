　　The Swift and Valiant Annihilation War
  　Frontline Reporter's Account of the Annihilation of the Yan Bandit's 45th Division
    [Jinzhong Front, 21st Dispatch] Frontline reporter Bing Ru reports on how our army, in the initial battle of the Taiyuan Campaign, used swift and valiant actions to surround and annihilate the Yan bandit's Provisional 45th Division: On the 2nd of this month, the Yan bandits, attempting to obstruct our army's offensive, drove their South District Defense Commander Gao Zhuozhi to cobble together remnants of seven or eight divisions (including Gao Zhuozhi himself, a defeated general who narrowly escaped from the Dazhangzhen battle in Jinzhong with injuries), and hastily extended outwards. When the Provisional 45th Division (lacking one new recruit regiment), Zheng Jizhou's unit, had just arrived at the Nanpan Village and Nanheiyao line, our army, with swift and courageous action, on the night of the 4th, inserted itself into the Chenghong Temple area on the west side of Nanpan Xiaodian, coordinated with the troops crossing the Fen River from Fenxi, cut off their rear, and surrounded them. That night, the Gao bandit Zhuozhi hastily dispatched a regiment of the 72nd Division from Xiaodian to reinforce Nanheiyao, but the Liberation Army's strikes were unexpectedly swift and valiant. Before the 72nd Division's regiment could even approach the Provisional 45th Division, it was divided and annihilated by our army. One of our assault units, not wanting to lose the opportunity, rushed lightly to the front line. The 2nd company assault team of this unit was the first to break into Nanpan Village, occupying two houses in the southeast corner. Due to enemy fire blockade and the untimely resupply of ammunition, the unit persisted from dawn on the 5th until the afternoon. Yang Desheng, the deputy squad leader of the Mao Dexing Squad (which had collectively received merit for attacking the electric light factory in the Linfen campaign), called out: "Maintain the glorious tradition of the Mao Dexing Squad and make great contributions to the attack on Taiyuan." Under the concentrated artillery bombardment of the enemy, they firmly defended the small breachhead. At six o'clock on the 5th, the general offensive began. From their fortifications, the soldiers saw the red arrows of our army's mountain guns, field guns, and light and heavy mortars flying in groups towards the enemy positions, and the Yan bandits' three mountain guns were silenced. Bai Rongpeng, a new soldier in the blasting team of the 2nd company of the 1st battalion of a certain unit, carried out two consecutive blasts, destroying the enemy's machine gun firepower point on the southwest side, opening the way for the assault troops. The Mao Dexing Squad carried out two consecutive assaults. The deputy squad leader ordered two groups to go onto the roofs, using bombs to alternately strike the enemy in the high buildings, not allowing the enemy a chance to breathe and retaliate. Deputy Squad Leader Yang Qingsheng led the grenade throwing team to suppress the enemy in the courtyard twice, capturing two machine guns and two rifles. The blasting team of the 3rd battalion of a certain unit, led by Dou Jiming, carried out five consecutive blasts, rushing straight towards the heart of the enemy from the south main street. When the blasting team broke through the wall into the fourth courtyard, the second platoon deputy Zhang Fengying and the instructor led people in to search, capturing an enemy soldier, who revealed that the headquarters of the enemy's 45th Division was just ahead. Squad Leader Niu Maosheng discovered that the enemy had already collapsed and was running around in disarray. He first cleverly and bravely captured more than two hundred enemies alive. The enemy's command system in Nanpan Village was completely disrupted by our army, and the Yan bandits scattered and fled for their lives. Niu Maosheng climbed up to the courtyard of the enemy division headquarters alone, holding a bomb and shouting, "Lay down your arms and surrender, and you will not be killed!" A soldier from the enemy artillery company agreed and said, "Don't kill me, I'll find you the cannons." The Yan bandits' three mountain guns then became our army's weapons for attacking Taiyuan. The Yan bandit's Provisional 45th Division was thus completely annihilated by us, with no one escaping the net. Zheng Jizhou, the commander of the Provisional 45th Division, who had narrowly escaped the encirclement in the Jinzhong Campaign, was finally captured alive by us this time.

　　神速勇猛的围歼战
  　前线记者报导歼阎匪四十五师经过
    【晋中前线二十一日电】前线记者冰如报导我军在太原战役初战中，以神速勇猛动作，包围聚歼阎匪暂四十五师经过称：本月二日，阎匪妄图阻挡我军的进攻，驱使其南区守碉司令高倬之，拼凑了七八个师的残兵败将（连高倬之本人，也是晋中大常镇战斗负伤侥幸逃脱的败将）慌慌张张的伸到外围来。暂四十五师（缺一个新兵团）郑继周部，刚到南畔村、南黑窑一线时，我军即以敏捷勇敢行动，于四日夜插入南畔小店侧后之城西洪寺一带，配合从汾西渡河部队，切断了他的后路，将其包围。高匪倬之当夜慌忙从小店派七十二师一个团到南黑窑增援，可是，解放军的打击，出乎他们意料之外的神速和勇猛，七十二师这个团还没与暂四十五师靠拢，就被我军分割歼灭了。我某攻击部队为不失战机，轻装赶赴火线，该部二连突击队，首先突入南畔村内，占领了东南角两座房子。由于敌火封锁，弹药接济不及时，该部从五日拂晓，一直坚持到下午。该连毛德兴班（临汾战役打电灯厂曾集体立功）副班长杨德盛号召：“保持毛德兴班的光荣传统，为攻打太原立大功。”在敌人集中排炮轰击下，他们坚守了突破口狭小阵地。五日六时，总攻开始了，战士们从工事里看见我军山炮、野炮、轻重迫击炮的红色箭头，一群一群的飞向敌人阵地，阎匪的三门山炮变成了哑巴。某部一营二连突击队爆破组的新战士白荣朋，连续进行两次爆破，炸毁了敌人西南面机枪火力点，为突机部队开辟了道路。毛德兴班连续进行二次突击，副班长令两组上房，用炸弹轮番打击高房敌人，不让敌有喘息还手的机会。副班长杨清盛，二次带投弹组压迫院内敌人，缴了两挺机枪、两支步枪。某部三营爆破组，由窦记明率领，连续进行五次爆破，从南面大街，直扑敌军心脏。爆破组打通墙壁进到第四座院时，二排副张凤英和指导员，带人进去搜索，捉住了一个敌人，了解敌四十五师师部就在前面。四班长牛毛盛发现敌人已经溃散乱跑，首先机智勇猛的活捉了二百余敌人。南畔村敌人的指挥系统完全被我军打乱，阎匪四处溃散逃命。牛毛盛一个人爬上敌师部大院，提着炸弹大喊：“缴械投降不杀！”敌炮兵连一个战士答应说：“你们别杀我，我给你们找大炮。”阎匪三门山炮从此又成了我军攻打太原的武器。阎匪暂四十五师就此为我完全歼灭，无一漏网。在晋中战役中侥幸逃出包围的暂四十五师师长郑继周，这次终于被我们活捉了。
