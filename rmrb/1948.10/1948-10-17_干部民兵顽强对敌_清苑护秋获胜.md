[Jizhong Electric] Qingyuan district has achieved preliminary victory in the struggle to protect the autumn harvest. The district is close to the ditch of Baoding city. At the beginning of September this year, just as the autumn crops were harvested, the Baoding Chiang bandits gathered over three thousand soldiers from the First Regiment of the Provisional 32nd Division and local bandits, along with hundreds of carts, attempting to seize grain and sabotage the autumn harvest. The cadres of the district led the militia of the entire district in a fierce battle to protect the autumn harvest. The first time, the district cadres led a part of the militia, penetrating deep into Xiaowang Village, one mile away from the enemy's stronghold, killing two puppet soldiers and seizing two large rifles. In early September, villagers such as Moumou and four other militiamen, in cooperation with the working team, fought fiercely with over two thousand Chiang bandits looting the autumn harvest in Huangtuo area, fifteen miles south of Baoding, for three hours, repelling the enemy and killing or wounding eleven of them. On September 26, Liu Huanan, the commander of the bandit's Provisional 32nd Division, personally commanded three regiments of troops, attempting to encircle Xiaozhang Village, concentrating six heavy machine guns and three mortars to launch three assaults on the village militia, all of which were repelled. After persisting for more than two hours, the militia then maneuvered and withdrew, cooperating with the militia from other villages, launching an assault on the enemy's command post in She Naxian Village in three directions, disrupting the enemy's command, forcing the enemy to run back empty-handed. In this battle, a total of twenty-three enemies were killed or wounded. Since the beginning of the autumn harvest, the militia in the district have fought sixteen battles, killing or wounding fifty-four enemies. The enemy has continuously launched five surprise attacks on Xiaozhang Village and Hu Command, but all were repelled by the militia. Except for battles, the militiamen have never left the village, preventing small groups of enemies from operating during the day. Under the cover of the militia, the masses in each village were harvesting and threshing on one hand and strengthening their defenses on the other. The masses in a certain village were wounded in Tanghe South and drove the pigs to a safe place in Tanghe South. The masses in a certain village transported the grain to the villages in Henan. Currently, the crops in the district have been harvested and stored, and wheat has been planted. Moumou and eight other villages have a total of 47,463 mu of land. Excluding one-third of the river-occupied land and reed fields, 20,092 mu of wheat have been planted.

　　干部民兵顽强对敌
  　清苑护秋获胜
    【冀中电】清苑某区护秋斗争，已获初步胜利。该区紧靠保定市沟，今年九月初秋庄稼刚收割，保定蒋匪就以暂三十二师第一团及地方土匪共三千余兵力集结了数百辆大车，企图抢粮破坏秋收。该区干部分头带领全区民兵，展开激烈的护秋战，第一次区干部带领着一部民兵，于晚上深入到离敌人据点一里地的小王庄打死两个伪军，得了两支大枪。九月初，某某等四村民兵，配合武工队在保南十五里之黄坨一带，与两千多抢秋蒋匪激战三小时，将敌人击退，毙伤敌十一名。九月二十六日，匪暂三十二师师长刘化南亲自指挥三个团的兵力，企图包围小张村，集中了六挺重机枪，三门迫击炮，向该村民兵发动三次冲锋，都被民兵击退，坚持了两点多钟，民兵又机动撤出，配合外村民兵，分三路向敌人设纳贤村的指挥部发起冲锋，打乱了敌人的指挥，使敌人只好又空着车跑回去。这次战斗共毙伤敌二十三名。自秋收开始到现在，该区的民兵共作战十六次，毙伤敌人五十四名。敌人曾向小张村、胡指挥一带连续突击过五次，都被民兵打回。民兵们除战斗外从没有离过村，使小股敌人白天不敢活动。在民兵掩护下，各村群众一面收打，一面坚壁。某村的群众、在唐河南打伤，把猪赶到唐河南安全地方。某村群众把粮食运往河南村庄，现该区庄稼都已收完藏好，并已种上麦子。某某等八个村共地四万七千四百六十三亩，除三分之一的河占地和苇田外，已种麦二万零九十二亩。
