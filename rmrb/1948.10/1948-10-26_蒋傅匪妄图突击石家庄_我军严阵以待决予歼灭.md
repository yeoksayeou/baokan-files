　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 25th: Reliable sources say that as our People's Liberation Army has achieved great victories in North China and on battlefields across the country, the Chiang bandit Kai-shek and the Fu bandit Tso-yi in Peiping are plotting to raid Shijiazhuang to destroy the lives and property of the people. According to front-line sources: The Chiang and Fu bandit leaders have decided to concentrate three divisions of the Ninety-fourth Army and two divisions of the New Second Army to attack Shijiazhuang via Baoding. Among them, the Ninety-fourth Army has already begun to move in the Zhuoxian-Dingxing area. It is also reported that the bandit troops are equipped with automobiles and carry explosives, preparing to carry out destruction. However, this utterly absurd act by the Chiang and Fu bandits is doomed to failure. Leading comrades of the Party, government, and military in North China are calling on the people to mobilize, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the bandit troops who dare to take risks.
