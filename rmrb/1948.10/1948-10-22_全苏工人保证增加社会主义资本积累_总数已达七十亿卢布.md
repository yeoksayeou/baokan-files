　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS reports: The movement of workers across the Soviet Union to reduce costs, increase profits, and increase socialist capital accumulation has made new progress. As of the 7th, the total amount of accumulation guaranteed by workers in various regions has reached seven billion rubles. Industrial workers in cities and states such as Leningrad, Kuibyshev, Molotov, Kiev, Stalingrad, Gorky, Voroshilovgrad, Novosibirsk, and the Latvian Republic have decided to add nearly four billion rubles to the twenty billion rubles guaranteed by workers in Moscow. Hundreds of thousands of railway workers across the Soviet Union have also decided to add one billion rubles. Their method is to reduce transportation costs by 1.8% and save fuel by 2% this year. Since the launch of the movement, train drivers on the railways from the Donbas coal mining area to various industrial centers have achieved the best results, saving as much as 120,000 tons of coal in nine months. Recently, workers, engineers, and staff at Moscow's power stations have submitted new guarantees to Stalin: due to new improvements in their work, in addition to guaranteeing the completion of the original plan to reduce costs and increase profits, they will also undertake new and additional socialist obligations, guaranteeing to supply 265 million "kilowatt-hours" of electricity this year beyond the plan (each "kilowatt-hour" of electricity is the amount of electricity generated by one kilowatt of power in one hour).

　　全苏工人保证增加社会主义资本积累
  　总数已达七十亿卢布
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社讯：全苏工人减本增利、增加社会主义资本积累的运动又有了新进展。到七日为止，各地工人保证增加积累的总数已达七十亿卢布。列宁格勒、古比雪夫、莫洛托夫、基辅、斯大林格勒、高尔基、伏罗希洛夫格勒、新西伯利亚等城和州、及拉脱维亚共和国等地的工业职工，已经决定在莫斯科职工所保证的二十亿卢布之外，再加上将近四十亿卢布。全苏几十万铁路职工也决定加上十亿卢布。他们的办法是：今年减低运输成本百分之一点八，节省燃料百分之二。运动展开以后，从顿巴斯煤矿区到各工业中心的铁路火车司机成绩最好，他们在九个月中节省煤达十二万吨之多。最近，莫斯科各电力站的工人、工程师和职员，又向斯大林提出了新的保证：由于工作又有了新的改进，他们除保证完成原定的减本增利的计划之外，还要担负新的额外的社会主义义务，保证今年超过计划供应二亿六千五百万“千瓦时”的电量（每一“千瓦时”的电量即一千瓦电力在一小时内所发出的电量）。
