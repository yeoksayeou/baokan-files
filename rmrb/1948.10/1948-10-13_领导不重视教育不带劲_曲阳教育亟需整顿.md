(North Yue News) The Quyang County Education Section held a county-wide primary school teacher study test before the autumn break. Of the 141 teachers, 51 passed and 90 failed (including three who submitted blank papers). Three problems were found in the test: First, most teachers have low cultural and political levels, and they do not pay attention to learning, so progress is slow. The majority of them are either graduates or non-graduates of complete primary schools. Writing wrong characters is a common phenomenon. Second, the teachers themselves have many difficulties and are not in high spirits. Some teachers have little experience and encounter problems in their work that they cannot solve. Some have not been able to find a school site after being in the village for a month or two, and some even sometimes cannot get food. The district and county do not care, and the village cadres despise primary schools. Therefore, teachers want to change careers and go home. Third, the school-running policy is not clear, which makes it impossible to run schools well. Judging from the number of people participating in the test, nearly half of the villages in Quyang do not have established schools, and most of the schools that have started are half-day or morning-and-afternoon systems, teaching students as they arrive. Some teachers said: "We teach whoever comes, and the fewer students there are, the less motivated we are." Many teachers one-sidedly understand that primary schools should be run according to what the masses say, teaching whatever is needed, and when the masses say they do not want to run the school, there is no solution. Some teachers are detached from the masses: the teachers in Jianzili only focus on entertainment and do not teach students to read, so the masses do not welcome them and are unwilling to let their children enroll. The masses in Songjiazhuang, Seventh District, requested: "Please start school soon! Otherwise, after a long time, there will be no one in our village who can read."

　　领导不重视教育不带劲
    曲阳教育亟需整顿
    【北岳讯】曲阳县教育科于秋假前举行全县小学教师学习测验。一百四十一名教员，及格者五十一名，不及格者九十名（内有三名交白卷的）。测验中发现三个问题：一、大部教员文化政治水平太低，又不注意学习，进步慢。其中完小毕业或未毕业的占多数。写白字是普遍现象。二、教员本身有很多困难，情绪不饱满，部分教员经验少，在工作中碰到钉子，无法解决。有的到村一两个月还找不到校址，有的甚至有时连饭也吃不上。区县没人管，村干部轻视小学。因而教员想改行，回家。三、办学方针不明确，使学校搞不起来。从参加测验的人数看，曲阳有将近一半的村庄没有成校，开学的多数是半日制，早午制，随到随教。有的教员说：来一个就教一个，学生越少越没劲。许多教员片面了解小学应是群众说怎样办即怎样办，需要什么教什么，群众说不办校了，就没有办法。有些教员脱离群众：涧子里教员只着重文娱，没教学生识字，群众不欢迎，不愿让学生入学。七区宋家庄的群众要求说：“快开学吧！不然年代久了，俺村一个识字的也没了。”
