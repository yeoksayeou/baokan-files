[Taihang Electric] With the autumn harvest in full swing and the war support tasks arriving, all areas here are paying close attention to strengthening mutual aid leadership to ensure that both war support and production are not delayed, given the heavy workload and extreme difficulty in labor and livestock power. The masses in many areas, based on their own experiences and current needs, are consciously and voluntarily organizing mutual aid. This year, the organizational form of mutual aid is mainly small-scale mutual aid in most areas. Some, although larger in organization, also adopt the method of centralized leadership and decentralized activities. This small-scale mutual aid is popular among the masses because it is easy to lead, easy to calculate accounts, and convenient to arrange life, which is suitable for today's scattered small plots of land in rural areas. Especially in the current busy autumn activities of "harvesting a piece, cultivating a piece, and planting a piece," it is not appropriate to organize too large. However, it is necessary to implement centralized leadership and conduct mutual adjustments between groups to overcome the difficulty of lacking labor and livestock power. For example, a mutual aid group in Rujiao Village, Lucheng, with nineteen laborers, divided into three small groups after discussion because it was often difficult to calculate accounts and arrange life. When the autumn harvest arrived in Guoerzhuang Village, Wu'an, 138 male and female laborers automatically organized 33 small mutual aid groups to carry out harvesting and cultivation. According to a survey of seven villages in Shexian, they all adopted the activity mode of small-scale mutual aid and small-scale labor exchange. Other reports on mutual aid from parts of more than ten counties, including Wuxiang, Xiangyuan, Xiyang, Zuoquan, Changzhi, Neiqiu, and Gaoyi, show that the general mutual aid group has at most ten households, and most are five or six households, with four or five laborers. The mutual aid team of Zhang Haiceng in Doukou Village, Pingshun, is a small-scale mutual aid method of centralized leadership and decentralized activities. The team has a total of four groups. This time, many laborers and livestock power were lost due to military service and war support. However, due to the centralized leadership, the groups made mutual adjustments, overcame the difficulty of insufficient labor and livestock power, and smoothly carried out harvesting, cultivation, and wheat planting.

　　Planning Arrangements for Life, Mostly Starting from Reality

Secondly, the planning of leadership in this autumn's mutual aid activities has been enhanced. Generally, they can plan time and arrange life from reality and use labor rationally, thereby improving labor efficiency. Although there was no draft animal in the Li Wencheng mutual aid group in Yangbeipo, Licheng, they estimated in advance that there would be difficulties in animal power during the war support, so the whole group planted wheat in advance. As a result, they not only did not fail to plant wheat due to lack of animal power, but also planted it in a timely and good manner. The Yang mutual aid group in Dongzhai, Neiqiu, stipulated that women and children were responsible for harvesting, men for plowing and carrying manure, and weaker laborers for doing odd jobs. Some villages organized veteran half-laborers with better skills to specialize in plowing the land, male full-laborers to thresh and carry crops, and women to harvest, reasonably dividing labor and truly achieving "harvesting a piece, plowing a piece, and finishing harvesting and cultivation together." The war support militia in Loushang Village, Xiyang, felt worried about the lack of labor and livestock power after they left and were not at ease with harvesting and cultivation. However, after careful calculation, scientific division of labor, and a specific plan for the rational use of labor was formulated, they saw that the harvest, cultivation, and wheat planting could be guaranteed, that "no grain would be lost, and no stubble would be left," and they were all relieved. After production mobilization in many areas, the mutual aid groups first made accurate calculations based on the land, labor, and livestock power of their groups, and then formulated specific plans, giving appropriate division of labor according to the importance and urgency of life and the different male and female labor forces. In addition, by mobilizing all labor forces based on the equal value of work, productivity was enhanced and labor efficiency was improved. "No matter how young or old, everyone has a sickle during the autumn harvest." In Qiangen Village, Zanhuang, a large number of women and children were organized to participate in the autumn harvest, and the entire autumn harvest was completed in ten days.

　　Change Blind Rush, Pay Attention to Reducing Meetings

In terms of leadership style, many areas have made new improvements. Chongdao Village, Lucheng, found that one of the basic reasons why wheat planting was better this year than in previous years was that the leadership style of the mutual aid group had changed, overcoming the past method of blindly rushing to complete tasks within a limited time. Starting from reality, there are plans and inspections. When inspecting the mutual aid leadership last autumn, Dong Huangxu, Licheng, pointed out that in the past, there was a "rush" as soon as the autumn harvest arrived, and they were only afraid of not completing the "task," resulting in the premature harvesting of many crops, which damaged the interests of the masses, and the masses were very dissatisfied. Some villages even plowed the fields at night in order to "rush," focusing only on speed and not on quality. This formalistic leadership style has been changed in most areas this autumn. However, individual areas still have practices such as organizing night harvest teams, which makes the labor force excessively tired and affects normal production, and is now being corrected. In addition, some areas, based on past experience and mass feedback, paid attention to holding fewer meetings and calculating accounts frequently in the mutual aid leadership. After rectifying the mutual aid organization, Gaoqiu Joint Defense in Heshun proposed to achieve "no delays, no debts, no distortions" this autumn to further consolidate mutual aid.

### 太行转变领导互助作风  适合群众需要发展小型互助

　　太行转变领导互助作风　适合群众需要发展小型互助
    【太行电】秋收大忙开始，参战任务亦已到来。在此工作繁忙、劳畜力极端困难的情况下，为使支前生产两不耽误，此间各地均十分注意了互助领导的加强。很多地区的群众从切身体验与当前需要出发，自觉自愿组织互助。今年互助的组织形式，绝大部分地区是以小型互助为主。有些虽然组织较大，但也是采取了集中领导，分散活动的方式。这种小型互助由于好领导，好算帐，安排生活简便，适于今天农村分散的小块土地的活动，因而为群众所喜爱。尤其在当前“割一块、耕一块、种一块”的繁忙的秋活中，更不宜组织过大。但又必须实行集中领导，进行组与组互相调剂，以克服劳畜力缺乏的困难。如潞城儒教村一个互助组，十九个劳力，因时常算不清帐，不易安排生活，经过讨论，即分为三个小组。武安郭二庄群众在秋收到来时，一百卅八个男女劳力自动组织起卅三个小型互助组，进行收耕。涉县根据七个村的调查，都是小型互助与小型拨工的活动方式。其他据武乡、襄垣、昔阳、左权、长治、内邱、高邑等十余县部分村庄的互助报导，一般的每个互助组至多十来户，大多数是五、六户，四、五个劳力。平顺豆口村张海曾的互助队，即是集中领导，分散活动的小型互助方式。该队共四小组，这次支差参战，走了劳畜力很多，由于采取了集中领导的方式，各组进行了互相调剂，克服了劳畜力不足的困难，顺利开展了收耕种麦。
    计划安排生活　多从实际出发
    其次，今秋的互助活动，领导的计划性增强了。一般的均能做到从实际出发去计划时间与安排生活，合理的使用劳力。因而提高了劳动效率。黎城阳背坡李文成互助组，虽然组内没有耕畜，但因事前即估计了参战支差时畜力要发生困难，所以全组提前种麦。结果不但没有因畜力缺乏而种不上麦，反而种得及时，种得好。内邱东寨杨互助组规定妇女儿童管收割，男人犁地担粪，劳力较弱的做杂活。有的村以互助组为单位，把技术较好的老汉半劳力专门组织犁地，男全劳力打场、担庄稼，妇女收割，合理分工，真正做到了“黄一块、割一块、犁地块，收耕一齐完。”昔阳楼上村的支差参战民工，因感到走后劳畜力缺乏，对收耕不放心，但经精确计算，科学分工，合理使用劳力的具体计划订出后，他们看到收耕种麦保证可以做好，“掉不了粮食，留不下茬地”，便都安心了。很多地区经过生产动员后，互助小组即根据本组土地、劳畜力情况先作精确计算，然后具体订出计划，按生活的轻重缓急、男女劳动力的不同，给以适当的分工。再加上按活计工的等价办法，发动了一切劳动力，使生产力增强，劳动效率提高。“秋收没大小，每人一镰刀”。赞皇千根村由于在秋收中大批组织了妇女儿童参加，十天完成了全部秋收。
    改变盲目突击　注意减少开会
    在领导作风上，不少地区有了新的改进。潞城崇道村检查，今年种麦比往年好的基本原因之一，在于互助组的领导作风转变，克服了过去盲目限期完成的突击办法。从实际出发，有计划又有检查。黎城东黄须在检查去秋的互助领导时，提出过去是一到秋忙就“突击”，光怕完不成“任务”，结果青收了不少庄稼，损害了群众利益，群众非常不满。有些村为了“突击”，甚至黑夜犁地，光图快，不管好。这种形式主义的领导作风，大部地区在今秋是有了转变。但个别地区尚有组织夜收队等做法，劳力过分疲惫，影响正常生产，现已在纠正。另外有些地区根据过去经验及群众反映，在互助领导上注意了少开会，勤算帐。和顺高邱联防在整顿互助组织后，提出今秋做到“不拖不欠，不扭不兑”，进一步巩固了互助。
