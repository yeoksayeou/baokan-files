　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, Moscow, 25th: TASS is authorized to issue a statement on the Berlin situation and the negotiations held between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on this issue in August and September of this year. This move is particularly necessary because the news in the British, American, and French newspapers and the statements of officials, including Mr. Bevin's speech in the House of Commons on September 22, have not correctly stated the Berlin situation and the above-mentioned negotiations, and have often misled public opinion. In its note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on July 14, the Soviet government declared that the situation in Berlin was the result of the US, British, and French governments' violation of the resolutions passed at the Potsdam Conference and the four-power agreement on the control mechanism of Germany and Berlin. This violation was the separate monetary reform carried out by the three countries, the implementation of special currency in the western occupied areas of Berlin, and the policy of splitting Germany. The situation created by the Western countries' splitting actions indicates that the three governments are not satisfied with their absolute rule over the western occupied areas of Germany. They also want to use their special currency in Berlin, which is located in the center of the Soviet occupied area, to rule the currency and finance of the Soviet occupied area, thereby destroying the economy of the eastern occupied area of Germany and eventually expelling the Soviet Union from the area. This move forced the Soviet military command in Germany to take action to restrict transportation between Berlin and the western occupied areas of Germany, in order to protect the interests of the German people and protect the economic life of the Soviet occupied area from disintegration. At the end of July, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France sent notes to the Soviet government, suggesting a joint study of the Berlin situation and the broader issues related to it, and the Soviet government agreed to this suggestion. As a result of the Moscow negotiations in August, the four governments reached a consensus that if the four Berlin commanders reached concrete implementation measures, the following measures would be implemented simultaneously: 1. Abolish the recently implemented restrictions on transportation, trade, and cargo traffic between Berlin and the West German occupied areas and to and from the Soviet occupied area; 2. At the same time, stipulate that the German mark of the Soviet occupied area is the only currency in Berlin, and withdraw the "B" mark of the West from circulation in Berlin. In addition, an agreement was reached that the exercise of the German mark of the Soviet occupied area as the only currency in Berlin and the implementation of the monetary circulation regulations that follow would be jointly managed by the four parties. The four parties then instructed the four Berlin commanders to formulate concrete measures to implement the above-mentioned understanding reached in Moscow, and the Moscow talks were scheduled to continue to discuss other issues related to the German situation. The negotiations between the four commanders in Berlin in early September were not completed because the US, British, and French governments raised certain differences between the four commanders to Moscow for joint study with the Soviet government. The above-mentioned differences involve three issues, and the Soviet government's position on these issues is as follows: 1. The Soviet government insists on establishing control by the Soviet military command over air passenger and cargo traffic between Berlin and the western occupied areas, as well as rail, waterway, and highway traffic. Air routes cannot continue to be unregulated, because the four governments have reached an understanding that the agreement should aim to establish appropriate control over Berlin currency and trade between Berlin and the western occupied areas. 2. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary to strictly abide by the agreement reached by the four governments in Moscow regarding the powers of the four-nation Financial Committee and its financial measures for implementing a single currency in Berlin. The Soviet government cannot agree to expand the powers of the Financial Committee to the extent that the committee can intervene in the entire monetary circulation regulations of the Soviet occupied area. 3. The Soviet government expressed its agreement with the wishes of the US, British, and French governments that the four countries jointly manage Berlin's trade with the western occupied areas and other countries, including the issuance of appropriate licenses, which eliminates the differences on this issue. All of the above proves the Soviet government's attitude in adjusting the Berlin situation on the basis of mutually acceptable terms. Under these circumstances, whether the negotiations on the above-mentioned issues will be interrupted, or whether the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France can reach a satisfactory agreement, rests entirely with the governments of the United States, Britain, and France.

　　塔斯社对柏林问题声明
    四国能否获致协议全由美英法负责
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电：塔斯社奉命对柏林形势及本年八九月间苏、美、英、法四国就这一问题所举行的谈判发表声明。此举之所以特别必要，是因为英美法报章关于这方面的消息及官方人士的声明，连贝文先生九月二十二日下院演说在内，均未正确表明柏林形势及上述谈判，且不少次蒙蔽舆论。苏联政府于其七月十四日致美、英、法三国政府之照会中曾宣称，柏林所发生的形势乃美、英、法政府违犯波茨顿会议所通过之决议及四强关于德国和柏林的管制机构之协议的结果。这种违犯就是三国之单独进行货币改革，就是在柏林西部占区行使特种货币，就是分裂德国的政策。西方国家分裂行动所造成的形势表示，三国政府不满足于对德境西占区的绝对统治，还想借位于苏占区中心的柏林行使他们特种货币的办法，同时统治苏占区的货币与金融，从而破坏德境东占区的经济，并最后将苏联逐出该区。此举迫使德境苏军指挥部采取行动，限制柏林与德境西方占领区间的运输交通，以保障德国人民的利益，并保护苏占区的经济生活，使之免于解体。七月末，美、英、法三国政府照会苏联政府，建议共同研究柏林形势及与之有关的更广泛的问题，苏联政府同意这一建议。八月间莫斯科谈判结果，四国政府达到一致谅解，即若柏林四国总督达到具体实施办法，下列各项措施即同时付诸实施：一、取消不久前实施的对于柏林与西德占区间运输贸易以及来往于苏占区货运之限制；二、与此同时，规定苏占区德国马克为柏林唯一的货币，并收回西方的“Ｂ”记马克不在柏林流通。此外并达到一项协议，即以苏占区德国马克为柏林唯一通货之行使事宜以及随之而来的货币流通条例之执行，由四方共管。四方乃据此指令柏林四国总督拟订实施莫斯科所获上项谅解的具体办法，莫斯科会谈则预定继续讨论有关德国形势的其他问题。四国总督九月初在柏林之谈判，因美、英、法政府将四国总督间所发生的某些分歧提至莫斯科与苏联政府共同研究，故未完成。上述分歧涉及三个问题，苏联政府关于这些问题的立场如下：一、苏联政府坚持建立苏军指挥部对柏林与西方占区间空中客货交通的管制，铁路、水道、公路之交通亦同。航空线不能继续不受管制，因四国政府已获谅解，即协议应立意建立对柏林通货及柏林与西占区间贸易的适当管制。二、苏联政府认为必须严格遵守四国政府在莫斯科关于四国财政委员会及其在柏林实行单一通货之财政措施方面的职权所获之协议。苏联政府不能同意扩大财政委员会之职权至于使委员会得以干预整个苏占区货币流通条例的程度。三、苏联政府表示同意美、英、法政府之愿望，即四国共管柏林对西方占区及其他国家之贸易，包括发给适当执照，这就消除了在这一问题上的分歧。上述一切，证明苏联政府在根据相互均能接受的基础，调整柏林形势这一问题上所持的态度。在此情形下，关于上述问题的谈判是否中断，或苏、美、英、法四国是否能获得满意的协议，全在美、英、法三国政府。
