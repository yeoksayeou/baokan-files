(Beiyue Electric) The Beiyue District Party Committee, Administrative Office, and directly affiliated organs of the Military Region are currently working intensely to help local people with the autumn harvest and have achieved preliminary results. Personnel from the District Party Committee organs, from the 21st to the 25th of last month, harvested 91 mu of crops for the masses. The Administrative Office helped the masses harvest over 110 mu of crops in three days. The Second Team branch of the Party School mobilized and proposed six requirements, including "Do not accept compensation from the masses, do not lose a single grain, and do propaganda work." Over four afternoons, they harvested 150 mu of crops for families of military cadres, revolutionary martyrs, and long-distance migrant workers. The Beiyue Daily, the District Party Committee Guesthouse, the bank, and other units have also started successively. Some departments have completely suspended temporary work, locked their doors, and participated fully. At the beginning, all organs, together with village cadres in the stationed villages, conducted specific investigations and discussions based on the number of households, mu of land, and types of crops to be helped, and determined the harvesting steps. In order to do more work, the Political Department moved breakfast earlier and added a bowl of thin porridge in the evening, and organized competitions among themselves. Many comrades did not give up even with blisters on their hands. According to the statistics for the first three days, the Logistics Department alone had over 240 participants, harvesting over 100 mu of grain, 38 mu of corn, and 17 mu of sorghum, millet, beans, etc. Military dependents happily said, "Our children are in the army and our husbands are supporting the front, but the grain is harvested first." This influenced the village cadres, who would say to any villagers resting on the street, "Look, our comrades are still working, we must hurry up with our crops!" An old woman in Xialonghu Village said gratefully, "The comrades planted my grain when it was time to sow, and the comrades are harvesting it now. This is truly a family between the army and the people." Currently, all organs are continuing to help the masses with the autumn harvest in a concentrated effort.

　　北岳区党委等机关
    帮助驻地收秋
    【北岳电】北岳区党委、行署暨军区各直属机关，现正紧张的帮助驻地群众秋收，已获初步成绩。区党委机关人员从上月二十一日起至二十五日止，给群众收割庄稼九十一亩。行署三天中共帮群众收割庄稼一百一十余亩。党校二队支部曾进行了动员，并提出“不要群众报酬，不丢一颗粮食，作宣传工作”等六项要求，四个下午给军干烈属及远征民工家属收割庄稼一百五十亩。北岳日报社、区党委招待所、银行等单位，均先后开始。有的部门完全停止暂时工作，锁上门全体参加。开始时，各机关都和驻村村干部根据帮助对象户数、亩数、作物种类进行了具体调查和商讨，确定了收获步骤。为了多作活，政治部把早饭提前，晚上增加一顿稀粥，并互相找对象展开竞赛。许多同志手上磨成水泡也不松劲。据头三天的统计，仅后勤部共参加二百四十余人，割谷百余亩、棒子三十八亩，高粱、黍子、豆子等十七亩。军属们高兴的说：“孩子参军丈夫支前，粮食倒先收回家了。”影响得村干部见街上有歇着的老乡就说：“你看咱同志还干哩，咱们的庄稼更得抓紧哩！”下龙虎村一位老太太感激的说：“我的谷种的时候是同志们种的，收的时候又是同志们收的，这真是军民一家。”现各机关正在继续帮助群众突击收割中。
