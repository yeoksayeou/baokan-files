　　Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Jinan
　　People of the Entire City Resent It
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th] American-supplied Kuomintang planes continuously and indiscriminately bombed and strafed Jinan at the end of last month. The people of the entire city are extremely resentful of the Kuomintang bandit gang's atrocities of massacring peaceful people after the battle. The Jinan Municipal Democratic Government is now actively providing relief to the disaster-stricken people. When enemy planes invaded Jinan on the 25th, they dropped more than a dozen heavy bombs on Pulimen Street in a row, destroying more than 80 civilian houses and shops. On the 26th, when enemy planes bombed Jing San Road and Jing Si Road in the commercial port area, an entire family of residents was injured. The health team of the nearby People's Liberation Army immediately went to bandage and treat them upon hearing the news. On the 27th, enemy planes dropped many incendiary bombs in the urban area and strafed citizens who were putting out the fire. From the 28th to the 30th, enemy planes continued to fly over Jinan to wreak havoc.
