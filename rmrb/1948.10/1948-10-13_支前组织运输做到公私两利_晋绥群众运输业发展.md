(Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 9th) Mass transportation in the Jin-Sui region has rapidly developed with the support of the Industry and Commerce Bureau. In the third district (governing six counties including Wuzhai), over 680 carts were organized last winter, transporting over 7 million catties of materials. In the first half of this year, the number of carts participating in transportation increased to 1,699, with 5,178 livestock. In the Yanbei region, in just four and a half months, the organization of mass grain transportation alone reached 5,300 dan (石) (each dan being 250 catties). In the initial stage, the Industry and Commerce Bureau provided large amounts of loans, livestock, vehicles, cloth, etc., to help the masses solve transportation difficulties. In Ningwu, Fenglan, and Shenchi counties alone, loans amounted to 861.2 million yuan.

This mass transportation industry developed in the process of supporting the front and transferring public materials. On the one hand, it supported the front, transferring large quantities of public materials, and enabled the public transportation force to concentrate on military transport under the Logistics Department, greatly reducing the burden on the people. On the other hand, it regulated grain and materials in various regions, playing a significant role in relieving disasters, developing industry and commerce, and exporting local products. The experiences of various regions in developing mass transportation are: (1) Organizing mass transportation is easiest when supporting the front and transferring public materials. Local Industry and Commerce Bureaus should mobilize the masses through district and village representative meetings or farmers' associations, using loans or advance payment of transportation fees to solve their difficulties. Loans must be guaranteed to be used for transportation, repaid on time, and regularly supervised and inspected in coordination with district and village cadres. (2) To enable the transportation industry to develop, the Industry and Commerce Bureau should appropriately control transportation costs to ensure that transporters maintain a certain profit margin. Avoid the phenomenon of high and low freight rates. Transportation cost differences should be appropriately stipulated according to agricultural production seasons, road conditions, and the nature of the goods. The distance between stations should not be too far, allowing transporters to return on the same day or the next day, reducing the expenses of accommodation outside and absorbing more surplus transportation capacity from rural areas. (3) On important transportation lines, under the principle of voluntary participation, methods such as mutual aid, partnership investment (money or fodder), and cooperation can be organized. Using their own homes, livestock pens, and fodder, villagers can open side-businesses such as fodder shops, providing convenience for transporters, while the masses can also profit from it. In some areas, fodder markets can be established to appropriately solve the supply and demand of fodder.

### 支前组织运输做到公私两利  晋绥群众运输业发展

　　支前组织运输做到公私两利
    晋绥群众运输业发展
    【新华社晋绥九日电】晋绥群众运输业在工商局扶助下迅速发展。三分区（辖五寨等六县）去冬组织六百八十多辆大车，运输物资七百余万斤。今年上半年参加运输的大车增加到一千六百九十九辆，牲口五千一百七十八头。雁北区在四个半月中，仅组织群众运粮一项，即达五千三百大石（每石二百五十斤）。工商局在初期曾贷放大批款项、牲畜、车辆、布匹等，协助群众解决运输困难，仅宁武、峰岚、神池等八县，即贷款八亿六千一百二十万元。
    这种群众运输业是在支援前线转运公家物资中发展起来的，它一方面支援了前线，转运了大批公家物资，并使公家运输力得以集中于后勤部担任军运，大大的减轻了民负；另一方面又调剂了各地粮食物资，对救济灾荒、工商业发展以及土产输出作用甚大。各地发展群众运输的经验为：（一）从支援前线与转运公家物资中最便于组织群众运输。各地工商局应通过区村代表会或农会发动群众，以贷款或预支脚费的方法解决其困难。贷款必须保证用于运输，按期归还，经常配合区村干部督促检查。（二）为使运输业得到发展，工商局应适当地掌握运费，使运输者保持一定的利润。避免运费时高时低的现象。并应根据农业生产季节、路途好走难走与货物性质等适当规定运费差额。各站口之间不宜过远，使当天或第二天可返回，以减少群众在外住宿的开支，以便多吸收农村闲余运输力。（三）重要交通线上，在群众自愿原则下，可组织变工，朋伙投资（钱或草料）、合作等办法，利用自己住家、畜圈、草料开设副业性的草料店，使运输者获得方便，而群众也可因此获利。在某些地区可建立草料集市，使草料供求适当解决。
