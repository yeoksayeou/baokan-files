　　Jizhong Administrative Office Calls for
    Launching an Anti-Counterfeit Currency Campaign
    [Jizhong Electric] Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits printed a large number of counterfeit Border Region currency and Southern Hebei currency, plotting to swindle materials from the people of the Liberated Areas. The Kuomintang authorities in Tianjin have printed one million yuan (old currency) worth of counterfeit money, of which 500,000 yuan (old currency) worth has been transported to Baoding, and 100,000 yuan (old currency) worth to Tangguantun. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are implementing many methods of circulating counterfeit currency, such as using special agents and puppet organization personnel to bring it into the Liberated Areas; buying grain in the marginal areas; forcing merchants returning from Kuomintang-controlled areas to exchange real currency for counterfeit currency; and luring petty traders in and out of the areas to bring back counterfeit currency for transactions. Currently, counterfeit currency is rampant in the marginal areas, and has also been discovered in inland areas such as Hejian, Botou, Cangxian, and Duancun in Anxin. To this end, the Jizhong Administrative Office has issued an urgent directive, instructing cadres at all levels to actively safeguard the interests of the masses, conduct widespread propaganda to expose Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' conspiracy to harm the masses, and lead the masses in the marginal areas to create an anti-counterfeit currency movement. Import and export bureaus must strictly check and prevent counterfeit currency from entering the country; in the management of inland markets, merchants and brokers should be mobilized to report anyone found with counterfeit currency to the local industrial and commercial offices or market committees. Minor offenders should be dealt with leniently, and serious offenders should be severely punished. Counterfeit currency should be confiscated and submitted to the county for safekeeping. Serious cases should be handed over to the county for handling. Banks should print booklets of real and counterfeit currency samples and distribute them to all levels and departments. Supply and marketing cooperatives, shops, and banks should post signs at their entrances showing the characteristics of real and counterfeit currency, so that the masses know the distinguishing marks.

　　冀中行署号召
    开展反假票运动
    【冀中电】蒋匪最近印发大批假边区票和冀南票，阴谋骗取解放区人民物资。天津蒋匪当局已印好一百万万元假钞，现已运到保定五十万万元，唐官屯十万万元。蒋匪推行假票办法很多，如利用特务、伪组织人员带到解放　；在边缘区买粮食；强迫从蒋区回家的商民把真票换成假票，引诱贪小利的出入口商人带回假票来当买卖做。现边缘区流行假票很严重，内地如河间、泊头、沧县、安新端村等地也已发现。为此，冀中行署特发出紧急指示，指示各级干部积极维护群众利益，进行广泛宣传，揭发蒋匪坑害群众的阴谋，领导边缘区群众造成反假票运动。出入口局要严格检查，杜绝假票入境；内地市场的管理上，要发动商民和经纪，发现带假票的即交当地工商所或集市委员会，轻的轻处理，重的重处罚，假票一律没收交县存查，情节严重的交县处理。银行要把真假票样印制成册，发给各级各部门，推进社、商店、银行等应在门口贴出真假的牌告，让群众知道真假标志。
