　　Soviet Ms. Fishman Analyzes Modern Chinese Literature
　　★ Ms. Fishman, a deputy doctor specializing in Oriental studies, delivered a report at a scientific meeting at Leningrad University in late July, analyzing modern Chinese literature. She described in detail the activities of the "League of Left-Wing Writers" and the works of famous democratic writer Guo Moruo, outstanding realist writer Lu Xun, and several others. Ms. Fishman said that some bourgeois historians are now trying to find a "common line" for all of modern Chinese literature, which is a wrong concept. There is no unified China at all, because there are two Chinas: one is the Kuomintang-ruled China, and the other is the people's China in the liberated areas. The new Chinese literature, built on the principles of human freedom and dignity, is flourishing in the territories occupied by the People's Liberation Army.

　　苏联费什曼女士分析中国现代文学
    ★专攻东方学术的副博士费什曼女士于七月末在列宁格勒大学的科学例会上作报告，分析中国现代文学。她详细描述了“左翼作家联盟”的活动及著名民主作家郭沫若、杰出写实作家鲁迅与其他数人的作品。费氏说，有些资产阶级历史家现正企图为全部中国现代文学寻找一个“共同路线”，这是错误的观念。根本没有一致的中国，因为有两个中国：一个是国民党统治的，另一个是解放区的人民的中国。在人类自由与尊严的原则上建立起来的中国新文学，在人民解放军所占的国土上正在蓬勃发展。
