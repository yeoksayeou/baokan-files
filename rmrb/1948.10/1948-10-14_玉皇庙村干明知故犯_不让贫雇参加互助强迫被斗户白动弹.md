[Taixing Electric] In Yu Huang Miao Village, Zanhuang, some village cadres, in order to retaliate against others in this autumn's mutual aid production, used the name of rectifying mutual aid to squeeze out seven poor and hired peasant households who were previously in the poor peasant group. The mutual aid group also supervised those who had been struggled against. One woman who had been struggled against cut grain for others for an entire autumn without receiving any wages, and couldn't even get enough to eat.

In order to correct the policy, a branch agency reporter added an editor's note stating: The actions of certain cadres in Yu Huang Miao Village in not leading the masses to unite in production, but instead retaliating against poor and hired peasants and preventing them from participating in mutual aid production, and using the excuse of "old habits" to supervise women who have been struggled against and make them perform unpaid labor, violate the principles of voluntary and equivalent exchange in mutual aid, as well as the policy of uniting in production and correcting deviations. Such violations of policy must be corrected immediately. It is hoped that leaders in various regions, in conjunction with current production, will continue to conduct in-depth inspections of deviation correction work, pay attention to resolving ideological problems among cadres and the masses, in order to continue to implement deviation correction and truly achieve the goal of rural unity and development of production.

　　玉皇庙村干明知故犯
    不让贫雇参加互助强迫被斗户白动弹
    【太行电】赞皇玉皇庙村在今秋互助生产中，仍有一些村干部为了报复别人，整顿互助时，就利用整顿互助的名义，把过去在贫农小组的七户贫雇给挤了出来。互助组并且还在那里管制被斗户，有个被斗户妇女，自己没谷给别人切了一秋天谷，不但未得工资，甚至连饭也吃不上。
    为了端正政策，分社记者特加以按语称：玉皇庙村某些干部，不领导群众团结生产、反在那里报复贫雇，不让他们参加互助生产及借口“旧习惯”，管制被斗户的妇女，进行无价劳动的办法，是违犯互助自愿等价原则与团结生产及纠偏政策的。这种违犯政策的行为，必须立即予以纠正。希各地领导上，结合当前生产，继续深入检查纠偏工作，重视解决干部群众的思想问题，以继续贯彻纠偏，真正做到农村团结发展生产的目的。
