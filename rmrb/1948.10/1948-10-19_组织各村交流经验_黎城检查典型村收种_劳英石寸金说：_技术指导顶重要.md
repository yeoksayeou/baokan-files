　　【Taihang News】The Sixth District of Licheng convened a meeting of 115 key cadres and heroes from 13 villages on the 24th of last month to collectively inspect the production work of Huo Jia Yao. The inspection method combined reports and discussions with actual on-site observation. The purpose of the inspection was to learn from each other's experiences. First, the village chief of Huo Jia Yao, Fan Jisong, introduced the village's work situation, saying: "Our village's work mainly relied on the leadership of heroes and models and the active leadership of cadres and Party members. At the beginning of harvesting and planting, due to difficulties with labor and animal power, the old hero Shi Cunjin immediately called on male and female laborers to organize well, with 'three early shifts equal one work day' and division of labor. After mobilization, each team and group made precise calculations, and the harvesting and wheat planting campaign was launched. A total of 105 women, both full and part-time laborers, participated in working the land, and women completed one-half of the total autumn harvest. Under the slogan of 'harvesting one piece and planting one piece', the entire village completed half of the catch-up wheat planting in ten days, exchanging 1,900 jin of good seeds. Although this work has achieved results, there are also many shortcomings, especially in the work of substitute plowing. The land of individual military martyrs' families was plowed very roughly, the edges of the fields were not repaired well, and the land was left uncultivated." Then, the village's hero, Shi Cunjin, said: "Technical guidance in production is an extremely important issue. If the crops are diseased after a year of hard work, all the effort is wasted. Paying attention to exchanging seeds and disinfecting seeds is a good way to prevent disease. My group has already selected more than four dou of good grain seeds for next year." After the Huo Jia Yao cadres finished their introduction, in the afternoon, cadres from various villages divided into groups and sections to conduct on-site inspections. In the evening, they participated in meetings of mutual aid teams in Huo Jia Yao, using chat sessions to learn from their experiences. On the 15th, a general meeting was held for discussions and to report on the inspection situation. Everyone, with an attitude of learning, enthusiastically expressed their opinions. The Peng Zhuang Party branch secretary said: "The leadership of the cadres and heroes of Huo Jia Yao is very good, truly achieving 'harvesting one yellow piece and planting one piece', and doing it very meticulously. Shi Jinshui not only harvested two mu of yellow millet first out of his four mu, but also planted wheat." The Li Jia Yao cadre said: "I inspected Zhao × De's wheat field, and it was repaired very well, without a single blade of grass. Wang Haijiu applied 150 dan of manure to his one and a half mu of wheat land. Their intensive cultivation and heavy fertilization are actually being implemented." Everyone unanimously pointed out: Huo Jia Yao's heavy manuring, intensive cultivation, good technical leadership, work recording according to effort, good organizational leadership, and rational use of labor and animal power are all good. From the on-site inspections during the day to the team meetings in the evening, what was said and done were the same. Finally, the branch secretary summarized, calling on everyone to learn from each other and do a good job in harvesting and planting.

　　组织各村交流经验
  　黎城检查典型村收种
  　劳英石寸金说：“技术指导顶重要”
    【太行讯】黎城六区于上月二十四日召开十三个村的主要干部、英雄等一百一十五人的大会，集体检查霍家窑的生产工作。检查方法是大会报告讨论与实际上地察看相结合。检查目的是为了互相学习经验。先由霍家窑村长樊记松介绍该村工作情况，他说：“我村工作主要是依靠了英雄模范的带头与干部党员的积极领导，收耕开始时，因劳畜力困难，老英雄石寸金即号召男女劳力组织好，三早顶一工，分工做活，经过发动，各队各组都做了精确计算，收耕种麦运动才开展起来，全村共有一百零五个妇女全半劳力参加上地，秋收总数的二分之一是妇女完成的。全村在割一块种一块的口号下，十天完成一半赶茬麦，调换好种子一千九百斤。这段工作作的虽有成绩，但缺点也不少，特别是代耕工作，个别军烈属的地代耕的很粗糙，地边没修好，地也荒了。”接着该村英雄石寸金说：“生产技术指导是一个顶重要的问题，劳动一年如果田禾遭了病。就白搭工了。注意调换种子及种子消毒，是防病的好办法，我组已选了四斗多好谷种，准备来年用。”霍家窑干部介绍完后，当天下午各村干部便分组分块进行上地检查，晚上分组参加霍家窑互助队组的会议，用座谈圪扯的方式访经验。十五日大会座谈，并汇报检查情况，大家本着学习的态度，热烈的发表意见。彭庄支书说：“霍家窑的干部英雄领导的就是好，真正做到黄一片割一片，做的又很细致，石金水四亩谷不但先把二亩黄的割了，还种上麦。”栗家窑干部说：“我检查赵×德的麦地，修理的非常好，没一根草。王海久的一亩半麦地，就上了一百五十担粪。人家这里的精耕细作多上肥是实际做到了。”大家一致提出：霍家窑上粪多精耕细作好，技术领导好，按活记工好，组织领导与合理使用劳畜力好。从白天到地检查和晚上队上会议，说的做的都是一样。最后分书总结，号召大家互相学习把收耕作好。
