　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. TASS reports: Red Star newspaper published an article by Vasiliev on Burma's national liberation movement, stating: The broadest masses of the Burmese people are waging guerrilla warfare for freedom and independence. The uprising has spread to thirty-six regions. Central Burma is now completely controlled by guerrillas. The scale of the Burmese people's struggle for independence has greatly alarmed the British imperialists. The British military delegation and the British instructors commanding the Burmese army in combat have so far failed to help the Burmese government suppress the Burmese people's armed struggle. The British ruling clique is doing its best to spread rumors about the "Communist danger" in Burma, seeking excuses for sending troops to suppress it. They have in fact sent troops to Burma to suppress the national liberation movement with weapons. But the current situation in Burma proves the heroic determination of the Burmese people to fight to the end for national independence and democratic rights.

　　缅甸广大人民参加游击战
  　完全控制缅甸中部
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社讯：红星报发表瓦西列夫论缅甸的民族解放运动一文称：缅甸最广泛的人民大众正为自由与独立进行着游击战。起义已扩展至三十六个地区。缅甸中部已完全被游击队所控制。缅甸人民争取独立斗争的规模，使英帝国主义者大为惊慌。英国军事代表团和指挥缅甸军队作战的英国教官，至今均未能帮助缅甸政府压倒缅甸人民的武装斗争，英国统治集团尽力散布关于缅甸“共产党危险”的谰言，为他们派遣军队前往镇压找求借口。他们事实上已派军队到缅甸去用武器镇压民族解放运动了。但缅甸目前的形势却证明了缅甸人民为民族独立和民主权利斗争到底的英勇决心。
