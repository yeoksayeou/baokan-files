【Taihang News】Xiyang Second District convened a district and village expanded cadre meeting on September 5th to examine past burden work. The following problems were discovered: (1) Cadres and the masses engaged in departmentalism, concealing and shielding each other. For example, the Huaihuang Farmers' Association chairman said: "When assessing production last year, not to mention the masses, I myself was also selfish. When my production was assessed low, I didn't say anything, secretly happy in my heart. If it was assessed high, I disagreed and said rudely, 'Do as you please!' and turned around and left. After this examination, I realized this was completely wrong." The Shangyuan Village Chief said: "In order to reduce the burden on my village and let the masses speak well of me, I assessed the production of land near neighboring villages higher, and the land near our own village lower, so other villages wouldn't see through it." The Guojiazhuang Farmers' Association chairman said: "There is one thing I always kept in my stomach and dared not tell anyone. Due to my own selfish departmentalism, my village concealed more than 100 mu of land that wasn't burdened last year. Only after this examination did I realize this mistake." After everyone's heated discussion, they unanimously recognized the harm of selfish departmentalism, concealment, and shielding, and that they would inevitably be opposed by the masses in the future. They expressed that they would go back to mobilize and educate the masses to recognize this principle as well. (2) Cadres disregarded burden work, shirking responsibility as not being their own. For example, the Heituyan Village Deputy said, "I used to not be responsible for burdens, thinking it was the responsibility of the finance and grain committee, using my lack of understanding as an excuse to shirk it in the past. After this examination, this is an irresponsible attitude towards work and the masses." (3) A one-sided poor peasant and hired farmhand viewpoint, lowering and raising production without principle, further forming a disparity in production. For example, the Beimou Political Director said, "In order to follow the 'poor peasant and hired farmhand line,' our village reduced burdens by more than 40 points for poor peasants and hired farmhands last year, adding it all to the middle peasants. For example, Jiao Shengxiao's family of four, farming twenty mu of land, has everything after turning over; but because they eat and waste a lot and don't work hard, they have temporary financial difficulties and are considered poor peasants and hired farmhands, and were taken care of in the burden, which encouraged their laziness. On the other hand, the land production of many middle peasants was increased." For example, the same quality land of poor peasants/hired hands and middle peasants has a very large difference in production, which hit labor and caused dissatisfaction. After this meeting, the cadres were all determined to correct this.

　　昔阳二区检查负担
    发现产量评议不公
    【太行讯】昔阳二区于九月五号召开区村扩干会议，检查过去负担工作。发现以下几个问题：（一）干部群众闹本位，互相隐瞒包庇。如回黄农会主席说：去年评议产量不用说群众，我也同样有自私自利，评议我的产量时，评的低了自己不作声，心里暗暗喜欢。如果一评的高自己不同意，态度很劣的说：由您吧！自己一扭就走了。现在检查，这完全是不对的。上元村长说：我为了俺村少负担，让群众说自己个好，在评产量时，便把靠邻村地的产量评高一些，靠本村的地评的低些，这样别村看不破。郭家庄农会主席说：我有一件事常在肚里装着不敢告人说，由于自己的自私本位，俺村隐瞒了一百多亩地去年没负担。经过这次检查才认识了这一错误。经大家热烈讨论，一致认识了自私本位隐瞒包庇的危害性，将来一定要遭到群众反对。表示回去要发动群众与教育群众，也认识这个道理。（二）干部轻视负担工作，推诿不是自己的责任。如黑土岩村副说，我以往对负担不负责，认为是财粮委员的事，借口不懂推诿过去；现在检查这是对工作对群众不负责任的态度。（三）片面的贫雇观点，无原则降低与提高产量，更形成产量的悬殊。如北亩政治主任说，为了走“贫雇路线”，俺村去年作负担时，即给贫雇减了四十多分，全部加到中农身上。如焦生小四口人，种地二十亩，翻身后啥也有啥；但因大吃浪费不劳动，一时生活困难，也认为是贫雇，在负担中进行了照顾，结果助长了他的懒。另方面把不少中农土地产量提高。如贫雇与中农同等质量土地，产量差很悬殊，这样打击了劳动，引起不满。经过这次会议以后，干部都决心改正。
