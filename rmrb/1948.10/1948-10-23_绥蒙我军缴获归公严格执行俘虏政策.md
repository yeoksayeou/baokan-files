　　Xinhua News Agency, Sui-Meng Front, 21st — During the Suiyuan campaign, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army strictly implemented the policy of confiscating all booty and the policy on prisoners of war. After a night of fierce fighting, a certain company of this unit, though hungry and cold, did not touch the truckload of steamed buns, biscuits, cotton-padded clothing, etc., that they had captured. Another squad, after fighting, immediately handed over the more than 70 million Chiang currency they had seized. They generally ensured that prisoners of war were not searched for personal belongings and were not insulted. In a certain battle, this unit captured hundreds of enemy soldiers. The soldiers automatically explained our army's policies to the prisoners and gave them appropriate care and concern, which greatly moved the prisoners. Seven prisoners of war offered pens and watches to the soldiers of the unit as a reward, but they were politely refused. Another prisoner of war secretly stuffed his watch into the hands of platoon leader Li Baolin, but platoon leader Li immediately told him, "The discipline of the People's Liberation Army is conscious!" and returned the watch to him. The prisoners of war said, "The People's Liberation Army is too good."

　　绥蒙我军缴获归公严格执行俘虏政策
    【新华社绥蒙前线二十一日电】解放军某部在此次绥远作战中，严格执行了缴获归公及俘虏政策。该部某连经一夜激战后，虽然觉得饥饿和寒冷，但对所缴获的整汽车馒头、饼干、棉衣等物却丝毫未动。另一个班作战下来，立即将缴获的七千多万蒋币交了公。他们对俘虏普遍做到了不搜俘虏个人财物，不侮辱俘虏。某次作战中，该部曾俘敌数百人，战士们自动对俘虏讲解我军政策，并予适当的关怀照顾，使俘虏非常感动。七个俘虏曾把钢笔、手表送给该部战士作为报答，但都被婉言谢绝了。另一个俘虏把他的手表悄悄的塞在排长李保林手里，李排长立即告诉他：“人民解放军的纪律是自觉的！”将表退给了他。俘虏们说：“解放军太好了。”
