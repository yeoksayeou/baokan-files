Jizhong Rectifies Logistics Organization to Overcome Waste of Labor and Correct Unfair Burdens

[Jizhong Telegram] In order to rectify the logistics organization and complete the major task of supporting the war, the Logistics Command of the Jizhong Military Region held a logistics meeting from October 1st to 6th. 64 representatives attended, including deputy logistics commanders, supply ministers, mobilization ministers, and representatives from relevant departments of various military sub-regions. The meeting first pointed out that the logistics work in the past nine months has been successful. During the Chahar campaign, more than 17,000 civilian laborers were mobilized to participate in the war. Strong cadres were selected from various counties to lead them, overcoming difficulties such as long marches, mountain climbing, and wading through rivers. They followed the army for more than five months, traveling thousands of miles, and completed the task of supporting the front. Among them, civilian laborers from counties such as Anguo, Anping, Wuqiang, and Jin County did not leave the team. After our army entered friendly neighboring areas to fight, thousands of civilian laborers followed the army on expeditions. In the battles around Baoding, the Xiongxian-Baxian campaign, and the Baobei campaign, tens of thousands of civilian laborers were mobilized, and a large number of stretchers and carts followed the army to support the front. In the past support efforts, a large number of meritorious individuals and model workers emerged. In the Eleventh Military Sub-region alone, civilian laborers from various counties produced 611 meritorious individuals, large and small.

Significant progress has also been made in saving civilian labor. The ratio has increased from one civilian laborer for every two soldiers to one civilian laborer for every six soldiers. Various localities have also adopted methods of on-the-spot supply. In villages within about ten miles of the supply stations, stretchers and carts are organized, and they are gathered when tasks arrive. When there are no tasks, they engage in production at home, greatly saving civilian labor and ensuring that both production and support are not delayed. For example, a certain supply station used ××× stretchers for long-term preparation in the three battles of Baobei, Qingfengdian, and the Daqing River last year. After on-the-spot supply, only short-term stretchers were used in the three battles, saving seven times more than in the past. In the past, each supply station often concentrated 240 to 500 stretchers, regardless of whether there were tasks or not, and waited until the end of the battle. After on-the-spot supply, the time and number of gatherings were determined according to the size of each station's task, and they were demobilized immediately after the task was completed, greatly saving civilian labor. Various supply stations also reduced the number of personnel serving at the stations. During the Shijiazhuang campaign last year, a certain supply station regularly had 19 county and district cadres and teachers and 121 village cadres and militiamen serving at the station, of which 81 were supplied by the supply station. In the Baobei campaign in July this year, the number of cadres serving at a certain supply station was reduced to seven, and the number of village cadres and militiamen was reduced to 66, with only eight supplied by the supply station, a reduction of ten times compared to the past. The supply departments of various logistics departments have also vigorously cleared war expenses, clearing out war expenses equivalent to about 40,000 large dan of rice. War expenses have also been greatly reduced. For example, in the Daqing River battle last year, the expenses of civilian laborers participating in the war with a certain unit for one month totaled more than 1.9 million catties of rice. In the Chahar campaign, the same number of civilian laborers was reduced to 480,000 catties per month. By March and April of this year, the expenses of the same number of civilian laborers were reduced to 300,000 catties per month, a decrease of six and a half times compared to last year.

The meeting pointed out that there were still many serious shortcomings in the war support work in the past few months: (1) Illegal mobilization and waste of civilian labor were still very serious. Some troops arbitrarily mobilized people and animals in the villages where they were stationed. For example, in the mobilization of civilian laborers in Rongcheng during the Baobei campaign, 28.2% were illegally mobilized. According to statistics from Beizhaoding, Chali, Daziwen, and Houzhangzhuang in Anping in April this year, 19,929 man-days of labor were mobilized, of which illegal use accounted for 58%. (2) Unfair and unreasonable service burdens: Many village cadres and militiamen do not perform duties, while honest people perform more duties, and troublemakers perform fewer duties. Many villages do not keep clear records of work, resulting in an imbalance in the burden on the village. Some people reflected: "We are not afraid of performing more duties, but we are afraid of being unreasonable." In Wurenqiao, Anguo, 533 people should have performed duties, but only 300 people actually performed duties. In Fuzhuangyi, Xian County, 116 people should have performed duties, but 66 people did not perform duties. In Yuanzhuang, Xian County, some people performed 150 workdays throughout the year, while others only performed 43 workdays. The burden of animal power is also unfair in some areas. Suning sold 850 livestock from May to August. It is also common to exchange mules and horses for cattle and donkeys. (3) The service organization is unsound. Many areas are disorganized, there is no training and education in peacetime, and some villages have disunity between new and old cadres. In addition, the task is assigned in a hurry, which leads to coercive orders during mobilization. For example, when mobilizing civilian laborers in the Eleventh Military Sub-region, some local cadres detained those who refused to go, and some grabbed anyone they could find. Others used deception and dared not explain the task. In individual places, there were also cases of arrests. Beiwacun, Gaocheng, sent three stretchers, and whoever was sent ran away. Later, the district cadres led the militiamen to the fields to arrest them. The militiamen fired their guns before they caught two people. Due to the unsound organization, poor mobilization methods, and unfair duty performance, the consolidation of civilian laborers was affected, and the phenomenon of desertion of civilian laborers was serious in several counties. For example, in the Baobei campaign, one-fifth of the civilian laborers in the Eleventh Military Sub-region ran away in about ten days. (4) Backend service is heavier than front-end service. For example, from January to March, Anguo spent a total of 154,961 man-days on front and rear service, of which rear service accounted for 62.3%. A total of 6,655 animal-days were spent, of which the rear accounted for 100%. According to Renqiu's statistics for half a year, a total of 280,000 man-days and 110,000 animal-days were spent, with rear service accounting for 67% of man-days and 92% of animal-days.

In order to overcome the above serious shortcomings and promote the past achievements in supporting the front, the meeting concluded that the following should be done in the future: (1) Strengthen organizational leadership, adjust logistics organizations at all levels, and the logistics departments of the Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Military Sub-regions should work together with the armed forces departments to strengthen unified leadership. The county logistics department should add one general affairs officer. Each district command post should have a dedicated person to concurrently manage service accounting, control the mobilization of front and rear services, and balance the service burden in the district. Villages should establish war support production committees to specifically organize war support production, record and clear workdays, and provide war-time condolences and supplies. At present, various sub-regions can first conduct key experiments. (2) Combine with democratic party rectification work, earnestly rectify the four types of task forces (militia, demolition, stretcher, transportation) and strengthen peacetime work. The central area should currently focus on supporting stretcher-bearers, and the marginal area should focus on militia and transfer stretcher-bearers. On the basis of the four types of task forces, form war support production groups (or teams, squads) and implement rotational duty and mutual assistance production (such as when a stretcher is sent, each class sends one pair of four people, and the remaining two pairs of eight people are responsible for helping the four people produce. War support and production are both recorded as workdays, and workdays are cleared on time). (Editor's note: It must be noted here that this type of organization should not be confused with the regular mass production mutual assistance organization. Because supporting the front is the duty of the people, in order to complete the task of supporting the front, this type of organization is a temporary formation, and the mass production mutual assistance must be free and voluntary and of equal value. This cannot be used to restrict the regular production activities and organization of the masses.) (3) Improve the organization of expeditions to support the front. In order to strengthen the leadership of civilian laborers on expeditions, each sub-region should set up a civilian labor department during the campaign, and each county should set up a regiment headquarters. The civilian labor department and the county regiment headquarters should both set up party committees and regimental committees. (4) Reorganize the rear service and balance the burden. Jizhong should establish a general transportation station to lead the transportation stations in the entire region. The local transportation stations should also be strengthened to strictly manage the service of people and animals in the villages under the jurisdiction of the station, and mobilize and balance the burden on various villages. Strictly correct the illegal use of civilian labor, as well as the serious waste, unreasonableness, and imbalance in service mobilization.

　　克服浪费民力纠正负担不公
    冀中整顿后勤组织
    【冀中电】冀中军区后勤司令部为整顿后勤组织完成支援战争的重大任务，特于十月一日至六日开后勤会议。到有各分区后勤副司令员、供应部长、动员部长及有关部门代表等六十四人。会议首先指出九个月的后勤工作是有成绩的。察南战股中，发动了×万七千余民工参战，各县都选派了坚强干部去领导，克服了长途行军、爬山涉水等困难，随军五个多月辗转数千里，完成了支前任务。其中安国、安平、武强、晋县等县民工无一离队。我军进入友邻区作战后，数千民工又随军远征。在保定外围作战、雄霸战役、保北战役，都动员了数万民工，大批担架、大车随军支前。在历次支前中，出现了大批功臣、模范，仅十一分区各县民工即涌现大小功臣六百一十一名。
    在节约民力上亦有显著进步。已由二兵一工到六兵一工。各地并采用了就地取给办法，在兵站、补给站附近十里左右村庄，把担架、大车组织起来，任务来了就集合，无任务时在家里生产，这样就大大的节省了民力，做到生产支前两不误。如某兵站去年保北、清风店、大清河北三次战役中，用长备担架×××副；就地取给后，三次战役只用了短勤担架，比过去节省了七倍。过去每个兵站经常集中二百四十到五百副担架，不管有无任务，一直等到战役结束。就地取给后，根据每站任务大小，确定集合的早晚和多少，任务完了立即复员，大大节省了民力。各兵站并减少了在站服务的人员。去年石门战役时，某兵站经常有县区干部、教员十九人、村干民兵一百二十一人在站服务，其中由兵站供给的达八十一人。今年七月保北战役，某兵站在站上服务的干部减少到七人，村干民兵减少到六十六人，由兵站供给的仅八人，比过去开支减少十倍。各后勤部门之供应部并以大力清理了战费，共清理出战费折米约四万大石。在战费开支上也大大减少，如去年大清河北战役中，随某部参战的民工一个月开支共折米一百九十余万斤。察南战役中同样数量的民工，一个月则减少至四十八万斤。到今年三、四月间，同样数量的民工一个月开支减至三十万斤，较去年减少六倍半。
    会议指出：过去几个月的战勤工作中，仍有很多严重缺点：（一）非法动员和浪费民力现象仍很严重。有些部队在驻村任意动员人畜，如保北战役中容城的民工动员中，有百分之二八·二是属于非法动员者。安平北赵町、叉里、大子文、后张庄今年四月间的统计，动员人畜工一九九二九个，其中非法动用占百分之五十八。（二）勤务负担不公平不合理：很多村干民兵不出勤，老实的出勤多，挑皮的出勤少。很多村记工不清工，造成村里负担不平衡，有些群众反映：“不怕出勤多，就怕不合理”。安国伍仁桥应出勤者五三三人，实出勤的只三零零人。献县傅庄驿应出勤的一一六人，不出勤的就有六六人。献交袁庄有的全年出一五零个工，有的只出四三个工。有的地区畜力负担也不公平。肃宁从五月至八月就卖了八五零个牲畜。骡马换成牛驴的也很普遍。（三）勤务组织不健全，很多地区组织混乱，平时没有训练教育，再加上某些村新老干部不团结，任务下达时间仓促，因之就造成动员时的强迫命令。如十一分区动员民工时，有的地方干部派谁不去就扣起来，有的抓球抓住谁算谁。还有的用欺骗方式不敢说明任务。个别地方还有抓捕现象。藁城北洼村派了三副担架，派谁谁跑，后来区干领着民兵到地里去抓，民兵打着枪才抓来二人。由于组织不健全，动员方式不好，出勤不公，影响到民工的巩固，若干县份民工逃亡现象严重。如保北战役十一分区民工十天左右就跑了五分之一。（四）后方勤务比前方重。如安国一月至三月份前后方勤务共出人工一五四九六一个，其中后方勤务占百分之六二点三。畜工共出六六五五一个，后方则占百分之百。另据任邱半年统计，共出人工二十八万个，畜工十一万个，后方勤务人工占百分之六十七，畜工则占百分之九十二。
    为克服上述严重缺点，发扬过去支前成绩，会议结论中提出今后应：（一）加强组织领导，调整各级后勤组织，八、九、十一分区后司与武装部合署办公，加强统一领导，县后勤部增加总务一人。各区指挥所要有专人兼管勤务会计工作，掌握前后方勤务的动员，平衡本区勤务负担。村设战勤生产委员会，具体组织战勤生产、记工清工及战时慰问、供应等工作。目前各分区可先有重点的试验。（二）结合民主整党工作，认真整顿四种任务队（民兵、破击、担架、运输）加强平时工作。中心区目前应先搞好支前担架，边缘区应先搞好民兵及转运担架。在四种任务队的基础上，组成战勤生产小组（或班、队），实行轮流出勤互助生产（如出担架时每班出一副四个人，其余两副八个人负责帮助那四人生产，战勤、生产都记工，按期清工齐工）。（编者按：这里必须注意，这种组织不能与群众经常的生产互助组织相混。因支前是人民的义务，为完成支前任务，这种组织是带有临时性的编制，而群众的生产互助必须是自由自愿和等价的。不能以此限制了群众经常的生产活动和组织。）（三）健全远征支前组织，为加强远征民工领导，战役期间各分区设民工部，县设团部。民工部及县团部均设党委及团委。（四）整理后方勤务，平衡负担。冀中设立交通总站，领导全区交通站。各地交通站亦应加强，严格管理本站所辖村庄人畜的支勤，调动与平衡各村负担。严格纠正非法动用民力，以及勤务动员中严重的浪费、不合理、不平衡等现象。
