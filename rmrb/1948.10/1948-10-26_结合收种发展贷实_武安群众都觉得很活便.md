[Taihang News] After a long period of deliberation and pilot experiments, the method of depositing physical goods in cooperatives and then obtaining loans of physical goods or loans converted to physical goods from banks and cooperatives has proven to be completely successful. This will greatly promote production in the liberated areas. In Wu'an, after pilot experiments in the three villages of Zhao Zhuang, Shili Dian, and Shi Dong, it was realized that providing physical goods (or loans converted to physical goods) to support mass production is indeed what the broad masses of working people desire, and it can ensure that loans truly play a role in supporting production. This kind of loan-to-goods conversion work is best done through cooperatives, with cooperative members being the primary loan recipients. After discussion and research in the county, it was decided that the work of depositing and lending physical goods should be developed in all aspects.

On September 11th and 15th, meetings were held with production committee members, cooperative heads, and village chiefs from nine villages in Hedong and Hexi, and seven villages in Tanling and Wan'an, respectively. This was the time when the autumn harvest was beginning. The meetings discussed how to organize the autumn harvest and wheat planting, how to solve the difficulties faced by the masses during the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and introduced the benefits, methods, and uses of providing physical goods to support mass production, allowing everyone to discuss. The discussions revealed the following ideas: First, some were afraid that there would be too many borrowers, and that lending to some but not others would offend people. Second, some believed that it was easy to make loans converted to goods, but difficult to get people to deposit physical goods, as the masses were afraid of exposing their property. Third, some believed that depositing physical goods could guarantee capital, but were afraid that no one would borrow. Fourth, some said that when the masses didn't have grain to repay, converting the loan to cash for repayment would make it difficult for the cooperatives to obtain grain immediately, and if prices rose, the cooperatives would lose money. Fifth, some believed that the amount of the loan was too small to make a significant difference. After a day of discussion, the following issues were clarified: First, loans should be used in a concentrated manner to ensure that the loaned funds play a role in supporting production, and should not be distributed equally and sparsely; however, they should not be too concentrated, so that those who need loans are not able to obtain them. Second, the purpose of loans is to increase production, and anyone who is actively working and has difficulties in production can borrow; production loans should not be used as relief. Third, public loans are a form of assistance, and in the future, cooperatives should establish credit departments to carry out deposit and loan services, using everyone's funds to solve everyone's difficulties. Fourth, the procedures for converting loans to goods and lending physical goods, as well as how cooperatives would manage their operations, were stipulated, and the funds were distributed according to the circumstances of each village, but not fixed. Adjustments would be made as necessary based on local needs.

After the meetings, comrades engaged in experimental work went to the countryside to hold mass meetings, representative meetings, and cadre meetings, explaining the benefits of converting loans to goods and providing physical goods to support production, and lending to anyone who had difficulties in production. Village cadres also went to the masses to explain, organizing those who worked hard to borrow. In order to make it convenient for the masses to borrow and repay, and to develop the credit business of cooperatives, loans were distributed through the better cooperatives. After more than ten days, 16 villages had loaned a total of over 11.3 million yuan, converted into wheat, millet, and cotton. In addition, 1,550 catties of sesame cakes, 2,500 catties of wheat, and 800 catties of millet were loaned out. At the same time, feedback from the masses regarding loaning physical items was collected.

Wang Mannian from Wang Er Zhuang wanted to borrow money to buy a livestock animal, but his mother refused, saying that raising livestock would also require labor contributions. He said to his mother, "We cultivate fourteen mu of land, and hiring someone else's livestock costs 12 catties of rice per mu, which is 168 catties. If we borrow some rice to buy a livestock animal, we can cultivate our own land and also cultivate for others, earning wages in rice, and also transport goods in the autumn." This convinced his mother, and he borrowed 70,000 yuan, equivalent to 189 catties of rice, to buy a donkey. Wang Wangzi wanted to borrow money to engage in sideline production, and when asked how he would produce and how he would repay the loan after converting it to rice, he said, "We grow two mu of millet, can't we harvest two stones? I plan to buy some cotton and sell it in Lin County, and bring back some cigarettes and sell them in Yangyi. If grain prices rise, other things will also rise, and I always keep track of things, so what am I afraid of?" Liu Qingshan's group from Shi Er Zhuang, with fourteen members, cultivated 30 mu of land that had not been distributed during the land redistribution, with an annual surplus of 2 million yuan. They requested a loan of 250,000 yuan to buy sheep to collect fertilizer, to solve the fertilizer problem. He said: "Our group has 30 mu of land, and each family also has some. If we can buy a flock of sheep, not to mention the production of lambs, just collecting fertilizer can solve the fertilizer problem for these lands. If the land yields more, it will be worth it anyway." Liu Manxiang's group of four borrowed 390,000 yuan, converted into rice, and used 450,000 yuan to buy a cotton ginning bow to gin cotton in the village, which the masses strongly agreed with. In the past, they had to go to other villages to gin cotton because they didn't have a ginning bow. He said: "The wages we earn from ginning cotton are also in rice, so what are we afraid of not earning enough rice to repay the loan in one winter (ginning one catty of cotton earns six liang of rice, and 50 catties can be ginned in one day)?" Zhou Xiban from Tanling borrowed 100,000 yuan, converted into cotton, and said: "I grow several mu of cotton, which has not yet been harvested. If I borrow some money to buy a cow, I can cultivate my dozen mu of land, which will save me over 100,000 yuan." Jia Maoxiao borrowed money to buy a cow, and said: "One cow can cultivate three mu of land a day, earning 24 catties of rice. How much can I earn in one autumn? After repaying the loan, I can earn a cow!" Even some people who didn't borrow grain said it was a good thing, and no one would lose out. If each village can organize grain storage and lending, the masses will be much more convenient. Jin Guoquan from Zhao Zhuang said: "In the past, if we borrowed two sheng of grain and ate it, how could we carry out production? Now, those who borrow grain all use it for production. The government really knows how to come up with good ideas." In addition, some people are still afraid to borrow, mainly because they are afraid of rising grain prices. These people, on the one hand, had benefited from loans in the past, and on the other hand, have fewer difficulties in production.

From pilot experiments to widespread development, in two months, loans were made to 19 villages, totaling 21,532,000 yuan, converted into 36,452 catties of millet, 19,317 catties of wheat, 2,049 catties of cotton (net), and 300 catties of corn. In agriculture, 8.1 million yuan was loaned to buy livestock, combined with 12.13 million yuan of private funds, to buy six mules, 42.5 donkeys, and 11.5 cows. 3.01 million yuan was loaned to buy fertilizer, buying raw stone, sesame cakes, sesame seeds, flax seeds, etc., which can solve the fertilizer problem for 493 mu of land. In addition, 7 million yuan was loaned to buy wheat seeds, for porters and transporters, flower houses, and flour mills. Combined with private funds, some gained considerable profits, and some added new workshops. In supporting agricultural production, the difficulties faced by the masses during the autumn harvest were resolved, and wheat fields were expanded. Households that borrowed sesame cakes in Shili Dian actively planted wheat, influencing those who had not borrowed sesame cakes to also actively plant wheat. Before borrowing sesame cakes, the masses said that there was a shortage of fertilizer this year, and at most half of the land would be planted with wheat. After borrowing sesame cakes, statistics showed that the wheat fields in the whole village had exceeded 65 percent of the total land area.

What issues need attention in lending physical items?

First, the price of production materials directly loaned by banks (or the government) and cooperatives to the masses and cooperative members must be fair, generally slightly lower than the market price, and meet the requirements of the local masses. Cooperative members should receive certain conveniences and benefits. For example, this time, the price of sesame cakes was fair, and the masses said: "It saves us from buying, and saves us the effort." Conversely, the branch bank brought in three livestock animals, which were animals from the flatlands to the east, could not carry loads, and were expensive, so no one borrowed them.

Second, physical item deposits, loans, and conversions to cash must be constantly monitored for price fluctuations, otherwise someone will suffer, and sometimes someone will speculate, and sometimes loans will not be made.

Third, loans converted to goods must be for things that the masses regularly produce and use, with normal prices. The types should not be too many. Currently, in rural areas, they are mainly millet, wheat, and cotton. In some areas, there may be a production item with abnormal prices: for example, Zhao Zhuang has many flour mills, which use corn and mung beans, which are sometimes very cheap and sometimes very expensive. In such cases, converting loans to goods would lead to speculation by borrowers. Another example is sesame cakes, which are very expensive during spring and autumn planting seasons, but no one wants them during the slack season, so they cannot be used as a basis for calculation.

Fourth, lending physical items must involve understanding the specific local situation and the production conditions of the masses, as well as the difficulties existing in production. Blindly proceeding will not work. After the loan is made, the production plan must be carefully inspected and assisted.

Fifth, when the masses use physical items for agricultural production loans, they mostly dare to borrow only what they plant in the fields, so the term of the loan must take into account the seasonality of the masses' activities.

　　结合收种发展贷实
  　武安群众都觉得很活便
    【太行讯】经过了长期酝酿和典型实验后，到合作社存实物由银行和合作社贷实物或贷款折实物的办法是完全成功了。这对解放区的生产将会有很大的推进。武安的贷实工作，经过赵庄、什里店、石洞三个村的典型实验后，体验到贷实物（或贷款折实物）扶助群众生产，确是广大劳动群众的要求，也能使贷款确实起到扶助生产的作用。而这种贷款折实的工作，最好全都经过合作社，贷款对象以社员为准。经过县里研究讨论，决定存实贷实的工作要向面的方向发展。
    九月十一日与十五日分别召开河东、河西等九个村及檀岭、万安等七个村的生产委员、合作社长、村长举行了会议。这时正是开始秋收。会议上讨论了如何组织秋收种麦，如何解决群众在秋收种麦中的困难，提出贷实物扶助群众生产的好处及作法、用途，让大家讨论。讨论中有如下几种思想：一、只怕贷户多，贷给这个，不贷给那个，得罪人。二、有的认为贷款折实好贷，就是存实物不易做到，群众怕暴露自己的财产。三、有的认为存实物能保本，就是怕没人贷。四、有的说，归还时群众没粮，折成款归还，合作社一时抓不住粮食，物价一涨，合作社就赔了钱。五、有的认为这次贷的少，起不了什么作用。经过一天的讨论，最后明确了几个问题：一、贷款要集中使用，使贷出的款一定要起到扶助生产的作用，不要平均分散；但也不能过于集中，以免应贷的人贷不上。二、贷款目的是提高生产，只要是积极劳动，在生产中有困难的，都可贷，不要把生产贷款作了救济。三、公家贷款是个帮助，今后合作社最好组织起信用部，开展存实贷实，以大家的资金来解决大家的困难。四、把贷款折实的手续及贷实物的手续及合作社如何周转作了规定，根据各村情况把款分了一下，但不作固定。根据各地的需要，必要时再作调剂。
    会议后，作实验工作的同志分头下乡，召开群众会、代表主任会、干部会、说明贷款折实的好处和贷实物扶助生产，谁在生产中有困难即贷给谁。村干部也分头向群众解释，组织努力生产的人来贷。为了使群众贷还方便和发展合作社的信用业务，对比较好的合作社都通过他们去发放。经过十几天时间，十六个村共贷出一千一百三十余万元，折成麦子、小米、棉花。另外还贷出大麻饼一千五百五十斤，麦子二千五百斤，小米八百斤。与此同时，搜集了群众对贷实的反映。
    王二庄王满年想贷款买一个牲口，他娘不叫，说喂牲口还得支差，他对他娘说：“咱种十四亩地，找人家牲口耕，每亩出工资米十二斤，就得出一百六十八斤，咱贷点米买个牲口，自己的地也耕了，还能给别人耕，赚工资米，秋后还能运输。”把他娘说的想通了，贷款七万元，折米一百八十九斤，买驴一头。王望子想贷款搞副业，问他怎样生产，折成米以后怎样归还？他说，咱种二亩谷子，还不打两石，还怕还不了？我计划买点棉花到林县去卖，往回担些纸烟，到阳邑出卖。粮价涨，其他东西也会涨，我经常掌握着东西怕什么？史二庄刘青山组十四人，种了平分时未分下去的土地三十亩，一年生产结余二百万元，要求贷款二十五万元，买羊集肥，解决肥料问题。他说：我们组里有三十亩地，每人家里也有些，如果能买一群羊，别说下小羊生产，光集肥也能解决这些地里的肥料困难，地里收成多，怎样也上算。刘满香组四人贷款三十九万元折成米，用四十五万元买弹花弓一个，在村里弹花，群众很同意。因过去没弓，都是到外村去弹。他说：咱弹花赚了工资也是米，还怕一冬赚不出贷的这点米来（弹一斤花工资米六两，一天可弹五十斤）？檀岭周西办贷十万元折成棉花，他说：我种的几亩棉花，现在还未收下来，贷点款买个牛，能把自己十几亩地耕了，就会省下十来万元。贾毛小贷款买了个牛，他说：一个牛一天能耕地三亩，赚米二十四斤，一秋天能赚多少？还了款就能赚个牛！就是有些不贷粮的人，也说这样好，谁也不吃亏。以后各村能组织起存粮贷粮，群众动一动就活便了。赵庄靳国全说：过去贷款买二升粮食吃了，怎样能进行生产？现在贷粮的都用到生产上，公家真能想点好办法。另外有些人还不敢贷，主要是怕粮价上涨。这些人一方面是过去得过贷款中的便宜，一方面在生产中困难较少。
    贷实工作由典型试验到面的发展，两个月的时间，贷到十九个村，共贷出款二千一百五十三万二千元，折成小米三万六千四百五十二斤，麦子一万九千三百十七斤，棉花（净花）二千零四十九斤，玉茭三百斤。在农业上，贷给买牲口的八百一十万元，结合私资一千二百一十三万元，买到骡六匹，驴四十二头半，牛十一头半，贷给买肥料的三百零一万元，买到信石、大麻饼、芝麻、大麻籽等，共可解决四百九十三亩地的肥料问题。另外贷给买麦种的、担挑运输的、花房、粉房等，共七百万元，结合私资，有的获得不少利润，有的新增了作坊。在扶助农业生产上，解决了群众秋收中的困难，并扩大了麦田。什里店贷麻饼的户积极种麦，影响未贷麻饼的也积极种麦。未贷麻饼前，群众说今年缺肥料，种麦最多超不过一半，经过贷麻饼，全村统计麦田已超过全村地亩数百分之六十五。
    实物借贷中需要注意些什么问题呢？
    一、由银行（或政府经手）和合作社直接贷给群众和合作社员生产资料，价钱必须公道，应一般稍低于市价，适合当地群众的要求，对合作社员应有一定方便和便宜。如这次贷麻饼，价钱公道，群众说：“省了咱买，省了工夫”。相反的，支行牵去三个牲口，是东边平地的牲口，不能驮，价钱又大，群众都不贷。
    二、实物存贷折款，必须经常了解物价，否则会有人吃亏，有时有人投机，有时贷不出。
    三、贷款折实，必须是群众经常生产的，常用的，价格正常的东西，种类不宜过多，目前在农村主要是小米、麦子、棉花。有的地区，都可能有一种价格不正常的生产物：如赵庄粉房很多，都是用玉茭和绿豆，有时就很便宜，有时就很贵。这样的情况，要贷款折实，会使贷款者投机。再如大麻饼，春秋种地时价钱很贵，到农闲时就没人要，所以也不能以它来计算。
    四、代实工作必须了解当地的具体情况和群众的生产条件，及生产中存在的困难，盲目进行是作不通的，贷出后还必须很好的检查帮助计划生产。
    五、群众进行农业生产贷实物，多是地里种什么才敢贷什么，所以在贷实的期限上必须照顾群众的季节性。
