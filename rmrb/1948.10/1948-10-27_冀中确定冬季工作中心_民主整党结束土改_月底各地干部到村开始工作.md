[Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong District Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a joint meeting of prefectural and county party secretaries from the 7th to the 10th of this month to discuss and arrange work for the three winter months of November, December, and January. The District Committee reported on the current work situation in various parts of Jizhong, stating that: Currently, in the areas where land reform can be carried out in the entire district, more than 6,000 villages have completed land reform, of which more than 3,000 villages have been initially concluded. However, the vast majority of villages have not issued land ownership certificates, and about 45% of the villages have been done perfunctorily and need to be redone. There are about 3,500 villages that have not yet completed the land reform work. In addition, more than 1,000 villages, including the three counties of Jinan, Cao, and Huanghua, have not yet implemented land reform and need to continue. Secondly, although the rural branches in the entire district have initially rectified the party during the land reform, and the impurity of organization and style has been greatly overcome, and more than 30,000 village cadres have been trained, and the village-level organizations have been initially adjusted; however, the impurity within the party has not been fundamentally resolved, and non-proletarian consciousness in ideology and lack of organization, discipline, and anarchic state in organization are still serious, which has become the main obstacle to the implementation of the party's policies and lines. According to the central government's instructions on land reform and party rectification work in 1948, the spirit of the North China Bureau's July meeting, and the above situation, the Jizhong District Committee clearly stipulated that the focus of work for the three winter months should be democratic party rectification, with the thorough conclusion of land reform as the main content of democratic party rectification; at the same time, it should be closely combined with the winter study movement, winter production, and support-the-front work. The District Committee clearly pointed out that this winter's party rectification work is to complete land reform. At present, the conclusion of land reform has become the urgent demand of the broad masses of people. It is necessary to implement the party's policies and improve the awareness of party members in the conclusion of land reform. Only by ending land reform and issuing land ownership certificates can the production enthusiasm of the masses be stabilized and improved, otherwise it will inevitably affect next year's large-scale production movement and the connection between the party and the masses. Winter study is a powerful link for publicizing and implementing democratic party rectification, ending land reform, and rectifying war service organizations. Therefore, this winter's work is closely related and cannot be separated, and must be fully implemented. Regarding the issue of democratic party rectification, the meeting made a correct estimate and a more detailed discussion. It was unanimously believed that after the initial party rectification during the land reform, the organizational impurity has been greatly overcome, but the ideological impurity is still very serious. As for the bad branches that are truly controlled by landlords and rich peasants or manipulated by hooligan degenerates, they are extremely few. The conclusion pointed out that: The requirement of party rectification is to improve class consciousness, strengthen party unity, closely connect with the masses, overcome the impure phenomena within the party and the state of being unorganized, undisciplined, and anarchic, so that the party branch becomes the leadership core of the countryside, in order to better complete the tasks of production, support the front, and fight against the enemy. The principle of party rectification must adhere to the truth and correct mistakes. Rely on the positive and excellent party members within the party as the main force of party rectification, and upright and active masses as the auxiliary force, with transformation and education as the main focus, to achieve the goal of improving the class consciousness of party members, removing non-proletarian ideas, and overcoming the state of being unorganized, undisciplined, and anarchic. Organizational disciplinary actions should be auxiliary. During the discussion, some comrades advocated emphasizing punishment for party members and cadres who made mistakes, and there was a purely punitive idea. The District Committee pointed out that this attitude is contrary to the principle of transformation and education and must be paid special attention to. The handling of specific problems of party members in party rectification must be differentiated and analyzed; it is strictly forbidden to deny everything and generalize from one-sided situations. Whether to rectify the party first or end the land reform first should be based on the specific situation of the village, grasp the most urgent demands of the masses, and determine where to start and specific steps. The District Committee repeatedly emphasized that investigation and research must be done before party rectification, analyze the situation, carry out work according to the specific situation, do not commit acute diseases, and do not generalize. The leadership should focus on the use of forces, gradually advance in a wave-like manner, and drive the surrounding general villages, and must not universally blossom. It also pointed out that different regions should have different contents of party rectification. In areas where land reform has been carried out, the main content is to end land reform and issue land ownership certificates. Among them, in villages where land reform has been completed, the main content is winter study, winter production, support the front, and issuing land ownership certificates; in areas where land reform has not been carried out, the main content is to carry out land reform; and in disaster areas, the main focus is on production and disaster relief. On the issue of leadership, it was pointed out that party rectification must rely on strong leadership, and all cadres who lead party rectification must be reviewed by the directly superior party committee. In leading party rectification, we must understand the branch from a historical perspective and cannot cut off history. The accusations and criticisms of the masses against the branch party members must be calmly analyzed and studied to clarify the nature of the problem and clarify the responsibility, and cannot blindly listen and blindly believe, but must be analyzed and differentiated, and at the same time trust the masses.

Regarding the issue of ending land reform, it was decided to end land reform as much as possible in the three winter months. The focus of winter production work should be on restoring and developing cooperatives in various regions. State-owned enterprise departments such as industrial, commercial, and trading corporations should help the development of cooperatives as much as possible. The focus of leadership should be on disaster areas. The content of the winter study movement should focus on being conducive to democratic party rectification, ending land reform, winter production, and supporting the front (rectifying war service organizations), closely linking all winter work and promoting each other. During the discussion, some cadres believed that "principles are easy to talk about, but specifics are difficult to handle," and that guiding principles and specific circumstances are two different things that can be separated. The conclusion instructed that this is an error of empiricism. It also pointed out that some comrades only start from their personal life experience and only one-sidedly emphasize the local situation, which will disconnect from the guiding principles of the superior party and fall into the quagmire of empiricism. We should strive to study basic theories and overcome them. Currently, the secretaries of the county and city party committees have returned to convey and discuss implementation methods, and cadres from various regions can go to work in the villages at the end of October.

　　冀中确定冬季工作中心
  　民主整党结束土改
  　月底各地干部到村开始工作
    【冀中电】中共冀中区党委本月七日至十日召开地委、县委书记联席会议，讨论布置冬季十一月、十二月、一月工作。区党委报告冀中各地目前工作情况称：目前全区能进行土改的地区，已有六千多村完成土改，其中三千多村已经初步结束，但绝大多数村庄均未发土地证，且其中约百分之四十五以上村庄作得潦草，需重新进行。尚未进行结束土改工作的有三千五百左右村庄。另有一千多村，包括津南、漕县、黄骅三县，尚未实行土改，须继续进行。其次全区农村支部在土改期间虽已初步整党，组织不纯与作风不纯已有很大克服，并训练了三万多村干部，村级组织经过初步调整；但党内不纯仍未基本解决，思想上非无产阶级意识，组织上无组织无纪律无政府状态仍然严重存在，这已成为贯彻党的政策路线的主要障碍。冀中区党委根据中央关于一九四八年土改工作和整党工作指示，华北局七月会议精神及上述情况，明确规定冬季三个月工作以民主整党为中心，彻底结束土改作为民主整党的主要内容；同时并密切结合冬学运动、冬季生产及支前工作。区党委明确指出：今冬整党工作就是为了完成土改，目前结束土改已成为广大人民的迫切要求，必须在结束土改中贯彻党的政策，提高党员的觉悟。只有结束了土改，发了土地证，群众生产情绪才能稳定提高，否则必致影响明年的大生产运动及党和群众的联系。而冬学又是为了宣传贯彻民主整党、结束土改和整顿战勤组织的有力环节。因此今冬工作是互相密切联系的不能分割的，必须全部加以贯彻。关于民主整党问题，会议作了正确的估计和比较详细的讨论。一致认为经过土改时初步整党，组织不纯，有很大克服，但思想不纯还很严重。至于真正为地富所掌握，或为流氓蜕化分子所操纵的坏支部已极少。结论中指出：整党的要求是为了提高阶级觉悟，加强党内团结，密切群众联系，克服党内不纯现象及无组织无纪律无政府状态，使党的支部成为农村领导核心，以更好的完成生产、支前、对敌斗争任务。整党方针，必须坚持真理，修正错误。依靠党内积极优秀的党员做为整党的主要力量，正派积极的群众做为辅助力量，以改造教育为主，以达到提高党员的阶级觉悟，去掉非无产阶级思想，克服无组织无纪律无政府状态。组织纪律的处分应为辅助的。讨论中，有的同志主张对犯错误的党员干部强调惩罚，存在单纯处分的思想，区党委指出这种态度与改造教育的原则相违背，必须特别注意。整党中对党员具体问题的处理，必须加以区别，加以分析；严禁只从片面情况出发，否认一切，一般化处理。先整党或先结束土改，应从村庄的具体情况出发，抓住群众最迫切的要求，去确定从那着手与具体步骤。区党委反复强调整党之前必须作调查研究，分析情况，根据具体情况进行工作，不要犯急性病，不要一般化。领导上要有重点的使用力量，波浪式的逐步推进，带动附近一般村庄，一定不要普遍开花。并指出不同地区应有不同的整党内容，在已经进行土改地区，即以结束土改、发土地证为主要内容，其中已经结束土改村庄，即以冬学、冬季生产、支前、发土地证为主要内容；在没有进行土改地区，即以进行土改为主要内容；灾区以生产救灾为主。在领导问题上，指出整党必须依靠坚强的领导，凡领导整党的干部，必须经过直属上级党委的审查。在领导整党中，要从历史上了解支部，不能割断历史。群众对支部党员的指责和批评，必须冷静分析研究，弄清问题性质、弄清责任，不能盲听盲信，要加以分析与区别，同时又要信赖群众。
    关于结束土改问题，决定在冬季三个月中，尽可能的结束土改。冬季生产工作，以恢复和发展各地合作社为中心，国家企业部门如工业部门工商部门贸易总公司，应尽可能地帮助合作社的发展。领导的重点应放在灾区。冬学运动的内容，应以有利于民主整党、结束土改、冬季生产和支前（整顿战勤组织）为主，密切联系全部冬季工作，互相推进。讨论中有一部分干部认为“原则好讲，具体难弄”，认为方针原则和具体情况是两回事情，可以分离。结论中指示这是一种经验主义的错误认识。并指出有些同志只从个人的生活经验出发，只片面的强调局部情况，就会和上级党的方针原则指导脱节，陷于经验主义的泥坑。应努力学习基本理论，加以克服。现各县市委书记已回去传达和讨论执行办法，十月底各地干部可到村工作。
