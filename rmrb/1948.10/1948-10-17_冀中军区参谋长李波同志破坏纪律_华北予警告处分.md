　　[Special Dispatch] Jizhong Military Region Chief of Staff Li Bo Violates Discipline; North China Issues Warning
    【Our Newspaper Special Dispatch】 Comrade Li Bo, Chief of Staff of the Jizhong Military Region, failed to observe revolutionary discipline and order, and also assaulted a guard on duty. The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued a warning as a disciplinary measure. The original text of the decision is as follows:
    Comrade Li Bo, currently the Chief of Staff of the Jizhong Military Region, last December, when Shijiazhuang was still under martial law, Comrade Li Bo did not have a formal entry permit, and the sentry at the checkpoint did not allow him to enter the city. Li refused to listen to persuasion and instead used crude methods to forcibly enter the city. This April, Li went to Shijiazhuang again to visit a factory. When he arrived at Warehouse 129, he intended to enter for a visit, but the warehouse guard refused him entry because Li again did not have a visitor's pass. Li again adopted a rude attitude and wanted to force his way in, but was resolutely stopped by the guard. He became enraged and slapped the guard squad leader in the face. Afterwards, the guard squad leader and others filed a complaint with the Central Bureau.
    Comrade Li Bo's behavior of not observing discipline, not observing order, and assaulting guard personnel is not permitted in terms of Party discipline and military discipline. From these two incidents, it can be seen that Comrade Li Bo has a serious tendency of warlordism in his attitude towards revolutionary discipline and revolutionary order. Comrade Li Bo probably thought that discipline and order were only for restraining ordinary personnel and the common people, and that only these people should observe order and obey discipline; he himself is a senior cadre and can stand above discipline and order. Therefore, when the sentry asked him for his credentials, it aroused his anger, to the point of hitting someone. This kind of thinking is a reflection of the remnants of the reactionary ruling class ideology within the Party. Senior cadres should be people with higher class consciousness, people with a firm mass viewpoint and a high degree of organization and discipline. Senior cadres, apart from the division of labor in their duties being different from others, and thus being able to command their subordinates in their duties, must respect the personality of any revolutionary comrade and their certain authority within the scope of their responsibilities. They must never rely on their position to insult others. Regarding revolutionary discipline and order, senior cadres should see themselves as the same as everyone else, with the same equal obligation to abide by it, and respect the powers of any personnel who maintain revolutionary discipline and order. Regardless of whether the person maintaining discipline and order is higher or lower in status than oneself, and regardless of whether these disciplines and orders are convenient or inconvenient for oneself, one should unconditionally abide by them, and should be a model of execution. This is the true spirit of revolutionary democracy; otherwise, the discipline of the country and the order of society cannot be established and maintained.
    After the first incident occurred, the Central Bureau had verbally notified Comrade Li Bo and urged him to pay attention. However, Comrade Li Bo remained indifferent, and therefore the second incident occurred. In order to educate Comrade Li Bo and to enforce Party and military discipline, the Central Bureau has decided to give Comrade Li Bo a warning as a disciplinary measure.

　　冀中军区参谋长李波同志破坏纪律
  　华北予警告处分
    【本报特讯】冀中军区参谋长李波同志不遵守革命纪律与革命秩序，并欧打正在执行职务的警卫人员，中共中央华北局特予以警告处分。决定原文如下：
    李波同志，现任冀中军区参谋长，去年十二月石家庄仍在戒严时期，李波同志因无正式入城证件，卡口哨兵不许他入城，李不听劝阻，反用横蛮办法强行入城。今年四月李又去石家庄参观工厂，到一二九仓库时，拟入参观，仓库卫兵因李又没有参观证件，拒绝入内，李又采取横蛮态度要强行入内，但遭卫兵坚决阻止，便恼羞成怒，打了警卫班长一个耳光，事后警卫班长等向中央局提出控诉。
    李波同志这种不守纪律、不守秩序、欧打警卫人员的行为，在党纪和军纪方面均是不许可的。从这两件事情中，可看出李波同志对于革命纪律和革命秩序的态度有严重的军阀主义倾向。李波同志大约以为纪律和秩序只是为约束那些普通人员和老百姓的，只有这些人才该遵守秩序，服从纪律；他自己是高级干部，可以站在纪律和秩序之上，所以在哨兵向他要证件时，就引起了他的恼怒，以至打人。这种思想是反动统治阶级思想的残余在党内的反映。高级干部应该是具有更高的阶级觉悟的人，是有坚强群众观点与高度组织性与纪律性的人，高级干部除了职务上的分工与别人有所不同，因而在职务上可以指挥其下属的同志外，对于任何革命同志的人格及其在职责范围内的一定的权力，都必须加以尊重，决不能依仗自己的地位来侮辱别人。对革命纪律和秩序，高级干部更应把自己看成和大家一样，有同样的平等的遵守的义务，尊重任何维持革命纪律与秩序的人员的职权。无论维持纪律和秩序的人比自己地位高或低，也无论这些纪律和秩序对自己方便或不方便，都应无条件地遵守，而且应当是执行的模范。这才是真正的革命的民主主义的精神，否则国家的纪律和社会的秩序就无从建立与维持。
    李波同志在第一次事情发生后，中央局曾经命人口头通知过他，促使注意。但李波同志仍漠然视之，因而发生了第二次事件。中央局为教育李波同志及严肃党和军队的纪律，特决定给李波同志以警告的处分。
