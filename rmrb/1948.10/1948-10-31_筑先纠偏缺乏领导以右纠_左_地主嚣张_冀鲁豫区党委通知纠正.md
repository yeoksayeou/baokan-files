[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] Since Zhuxian began its work of rectifying policies, the mood for rural production has gradually stabilized. This proves that correcting deviations is necessary, and it is the responsibility of leaders to correct any deviations. However, the correction work in Zhuxian, due to a lack of leadership, has become uncontrolled, leading to serious deviations. In Zhuxian's Seventh District, out of a total of thirty-four administrative villages, many middle peasants and poor peasants were wrongly struggled against during the land reform review last year. According to the district's total of 3,007 households, 240 households were struggled against, accounting for 8.1 percent. Among them, 25 were landlords, 59 were rich peasants, while middle peasants accounted for 142, and poor peasants 18. Politically and economically, the rule of landlords and rich peasants and the feudal exploitation system have been defeated, but the masses' awareness and organizational strength are not yet consolidated. In the correction of deviations, because some individual party branch members and village cadres are still shielding landlords and rich peasants, coupled with the landlords and rich peasants spreading rumors, this has caused unrest among the masses. For example, the director of the Jiangzhuang farmers' association, under the pretext of rectifying policies, mobilized poor and hired peasants to return land, helping those who had been struggled against to demand houses and land. The director of the Luzhuang farmers' association told poor peasants: "Poor people who exchanged houses, quickly move out while it's hot." They dug up the only things the poor and hired had gained to compensate the landlords, which fueled the arrogance of the landlords and rich peasants. Xu Houming, a rich peasant from Jiangzhuang who was criticized and struggled against, went to his original house to threaten the households who had been allocated houses to move out. Liang Boping, a rich peasant from Liangzhuang, and his brothers went to their original house to demand to live with the poor peasants who had been allocated houses. Some landlords and rich peasants seized back carts and furniture from the masses under the guise of borrowing. Some middle peasants surrendered to and leaned towards the landlords. For example, in Zhangzhuang, during compensation and resettlement, the middle peasants were the first to voluntarily report that they would return the fruits they had gained last year. Some middle peasants said during a meeting to discuss compensation and resettlement: "Last year, we struggled against the landlords' land with crops, and this year, returning it to them with crops is not a loss."

The main reasons for this situation are that the leadership's understanding of the purpose of rectifying policies is not clear, and their stance is not firm. This is reflected in: (1) The county only generally conveys the anti-leftist rectification, without linking it to its own specific situation. (2) They only pay attention to compensation and resettlement, without considering the extent to which the poor and hired peasants have turned over, and whether the struggle against landlords and rich peasants was wrong. (3) In compensation, they propose to compensate from the wealth that the not-thoroughly-dealt-with and escaped landlords and rich peasants and wealthy middle peasants can possibly be mobilized from, as well as those who occupied or divided more than their share. Some only focus on reporting outwards the things the poor and hired peasants divided. After repeated mobilization in Luzhuang, the poor and hired peasants, who had divided six *qing* of land in total, impulsively reported three *qing* (but only 70 *mu* were needed for compensation and resettlement). Some poor and hired peasants returned the land with crops already planted to the landlords and rich peasants, but the leadership considered this to be a "high level of awareness" of the poor and hired peasants. Later, some changed it to three-seven, four-six, or half-and-half split, and the leadership silently approved it as reasonable. In handling these issues, some working staff became mediators, causing the arrogance of landlords and rich peasants in some villages, the activity of elements shielding landlords and rich peasants, the wavering of middle peasants leaning towards landlords and rich peasants, and the restlessness of poor and hired peasants. Although this phenomenon does not exist in every village, it is quite common and has a great impact. Looking only at the amount of land, the result of compensation and resettlement is that some landlords and rich peasants already have more than the poor and hired peasants. After compensation and resettlement in Jiangzhuang, the average rich peasant had 3.2 *mu* per person, the six compensated middle peasant households had an average of 4.1 *mu* per person, and the poor peasants only had an average of 2.9 *mu* per person. The average for the entire village was 3.5 *mu* per person. In Xuzhuang, after resettling three landlord households, each person had an average of 3.4 *mu*; two rich peasant households had 4.3 *mu* per person; and the poor peasants only had an average of 2.64 *mu* per person. In addition, compensation and resettlement were not done voluntarily by the masses, and it was not done according to the actual situation, but for the sake of compensation and resettlement, thus causing serious deviations. (Judging from the three compensation methods proposed by some leaders in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, they are inherently wrong, because (1) it only mentions anti-leftist rectification and compensating landlords and rich peasants, without mentioning the great achievements of the land reform in the past two years in eradicating the feudal exploitation system; (2) it proposes to mobilize things that wealthy middle peasants can possibly mobilize and things that those who occupied or divided more than their share possess to compensate landlords and rich peasants, there is some truth in this, but it is wrong to speak of it in such a general way without explanation and differentiation. – Editor)

The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Regional Party Committee has begun to pay attention to the above situation and has issued a notice with four points: (1) Emphasize that landlords should abide by the law and work hard, and are not allowed to arbitrarily demand things from poor and hired peasants. If there are illegal activities, they will be punished according to law. (2) The vested interests of poor and hired peasants should not be touched in principle in the old liberated areas, and should not be touched at all in the semi-old liberated areas. Land rights should be determined, and efforts should be made to produce. (3) However, the leftist errors of last year must be corrected, and compensation and resettlement must continue, but it should be handled by the whole village, not uncontrolled. (4) In the past, all those who were uncontrolled, without leadership, without discussion by the masses, and not compensated and resettled by the whole village, should be quickly corrected.

### 筑先纠偏缺乏领导以右纠“左”地主嚣张　冀鲁豫区党委通知纠正

　　筑先纠偏缺乏领导以右纠“左”地主嚣张
  　冀鲁豫区党委通知纠正
    【冀鲁豫电】筑先在进行端正政策工作以来，农村生产情绪已逐渐趋于稳定，这证明纠偏是必要的，有偏必纠，是领导者的责任。但筑先的纠偏工作，由于缺乏领导，陷于自流，以致发生了严重偏向。筑先七区共三十四个行政村，去年土改复查时错误地斗争了不少的中农和贫农，按全区三千零七户计，被斗的二百四十户，占百分之八点一，其中地主二十五户，富农五十九户，而中农占一百四十二户，贫农十八户。在政治上和经济上，地富的统治和封建剥削制度已被打垮，但群众的觉悟程度和组织力量尚不巩固，在纠偏中由于支部和村干中仍有个别包庇地富分子，加上地富造谣，因此造成群众不安。如蒋庄农会主任，借口端正政策，动员贫雇退地，帮助被斗户要房要地。鲁庄农会主任对贫农说：“穷人换房的趁热赶紧搬出来。”挖贫雇已得的仅有的东西给地主补偿，这就助长了地主富农的气焰。蒋庄批斗富农徐后明到自己原房去威胁分房户搬家，梁庄富农梁保平弟兄到自己原房要和已分房的贫农一起住。有的地富以借使名义向群众夺回大车家具，有些中农向地主投降靠近。如张庄在补偿安置时，中农首先自报拿出去年分得的果实，有的中农在开会讨论补偿安置时说：“去年带庄稼斗了人家地主的地，今年带庄稼退给人家也并不吃亏。”
    造成这样情况的原因，主要是由于领导上对端正政策的目的性不明确，立场不稳，表现在：（一）县里只一般地笼统地传达反左纠偏，不连系自己具体情况。（二）单纯注意补偿安置，不看贫雇翻身程度如何，对地富斗争是否错误。（三）在补偿中，提出从不彻底和漏网的地富和富裕中农可能动员出来的，以及多占多分者去补，有的只着眼于动员贫雇农分的东西向外报。鲁庄经过三番五次动员，贫雇农一共分的六顷地，赌气一下报出三顷（但补偿安置只需七十亩），有的贫雇农将已种上的庄稼地退回了地富，领导上却认为是贫雇“觉悟高”。后来有的改成三七、四六、对半分，领导上还默认为合理。在处理这些问题中，有些工作员成为中间调解人，造成部分村庄地富嚣张，包庇地富的分子活跃，中农动摇向地富靠近，贫雇动荡不安。这种现象虽不是每村都有，但相当普遍，且影响很大。补偿安置的结果，只就土地数量来看，有的地富已经比贫雇还多。蒋庄补偿安置后，富农每人平均三亩二分，六户补偿中农每人平均四亩一分，贫农每人仅平均二亩九分。全村每人平均三亩五分。胥庄地主三户安置后，每人平均三亩四分，富农两户每人四亩三分，贫农每人仅平均二亩六分四厘。此外，安置补偿未经群众自觉去做，以及不按实际情况，为安补而安补，因而造成严重偏向。（从冀鲁豫某些领导上所提出来的三项补偿办法来看，其本身就是错误的，因为（一）它只提出反左纠偏，补偿地富，一句也未提到两年来土改肃清封建剥削制度的伟大成绩；（二）它提出要动员富裕中农可能动员出来的东西及多占多分者的东西去补偿地富，这其中是有一部分道理，但不加解释，不加区别地笼统地这样讲，则是错误的。——编者）
    冀鲁豫区党委对以上情况，已开始注意，特发出通知四条：（一）强调地主奉公守法，好好劳动，不准向贫雇农随便索要东西，如有不法活动，以违法论罪。（二）贫雇农既得利益在老区原则上不动，在半老区一律不动，确定地权，努力生产。（三）但对去年的左倾错误必须纠正，补偿、安置必须继续进行，但应由全村处理，不应自流。（四）过去凡是自流的，没有领导的，未经群众讨论，不是全村补偿安置者，应迅速纠正。
