    Inquiries and Replies
　　Corruption and errors in work should not be confused; Landlords and rich peasants who have changed their status should not be called "downgraded households."
    Q: 1. Should corruption and errors be combined? Last winter, during the land reform, in order to remove obstacles and mobilize the masses, some individuals, seeking to clear and divide more, exaggerated the corruption and errors of former cadres and purged them. Now, to clarify the facts and help new cadres deal with their corruption, the actual corruption is not significant, but the amount of property seized is large, and many issues are related to work style and errors. Therefore, the new cadres are unwilling to return everything as required, keeping some for themselves (some county and district cadres are also doing this). However, the purged former cadres cannot understand this (emphasizing that errors should not be mixed with corruption), which affects village unity. This situation is common. How should this be handled? Please explain clearly.
    2. Is the term "downgraded household" still necessary? Since the land reform started last winter, there were no clear instructions on classifying social status. As a result, landlords and rich peasants who had been downgraded for many years were purged and evicted. Later, after clear instructions, their status was revised (to middle or poor peasants), but the new village peasant associations cannot understand this (some work team comrades also cannot understand). Instead, they renamed them "downgraded households," claiming that the seized property should not be returned, only that their livelihood should be taken care of. Therefore, they are called "downgraded middle peasants," downgraded... households. They are unwilling to return much property, nor are they willing to provide much care. As time goes on, their lives become more difficult than average, which affects village unity (some former village cadres and the purged households are united).
    We are unsure if the term "downgraded household" is appropriate or if it is like labeling them with a minor stigma. This feels somewhat inappropriate for uniting them. What should be done? We hope for a detailed answer. (Lingshou, Lü Zhencai)
    A: 1. During party rectification, errors and corruption committed by party members should be strictly distinguished. Errors should not be linked with corruption. It is wrong for the masses to want to divide more property by exaggerating the errors and corruption of party members and cadres. Leaders should adhere to correct principles when dealing with these issues. Corruption must be based on solid evidence and not conjecture. The amount should be accurate, neither inflated nor exaggerated. Mistakes made last winter should now be corrected based on the facts. Property that should be cleared should be cleared, and property that should be returned should be returned. Some property wrongly calculated or over-calculated due to poor work style should be returned in full. It is wrong for new cadres to want to retain a portion and not return everything as required. They should be educated to recognize the correct purpose of party rectification and persuaded to act according to policy. Old cadres should not take the opportunity for revenge but should be aware of the bigger picture and achieve unity between party members, the masses, new cadres, and old cadres.
    2. After the establishment of the democratic government, landlords who cease exploitation and participate in labor for five years and rich peasants who cease exploitation for three years can have their status changed to peasants. They should not be called downgraded households or downgraded middle peasants. However, if they are indeed landlords or rich peasants who have been downgraded but still retain considerable feudal property, it is not wrong to hand over their surplus property during the land reform. According to policy, their status should be changed when revising their social status. However, property that has already been confiscated or requisitioned, if it is surplus, may not be returned. But if at the time of confiscation or requisition, their property was only at or below the level of an average middle peasant and there was no surplus, then it should not have been confiscated or requisitioned. If it has already been confiscated or requisitioned, then it should be compensated. As you said, landlords and rich peasants who have been downgraded for many years in your village were purged or evicted, and after their status was revised, they were all labeled with "downgraded household" and property that should be returned was not returned, which is wrong. For downgraded middle peasant households that were formerly landlords or rich peasants with little floating wealth, if it has not been distributed, it should be returned. If it has already been distributed, they should be compensated to the point where they can live and produce.
　　Income from mental labor must be protected by the government.
    Q: For primary school teachers from landlord or rich peasant families, is the ox purchased this year with their income from mental labor subject to confiscation or requisition during the autumn distribution?
    Will the grain produced by landlords and rich peasants this year be confiscated or requisitioned during the autumn distribution? (Zhu Xing San, Zhongxing Village, Baixiang)
    A: As you mentioned, the ox purchased by a primary school teacher from a landlord or rich peasant family with their income from labor is not subject to confiscation or requisition during the land reform. Because the land reform aims to eliminate the feudal system of exploitation. Property obtained from mental labor is naturally protected by the laws of the democratic government.
    Grain produced by landlords and rich peasants this year, according to the principle of "whoever plants, harvests," will not be confiscated or requisitioned during the autumn distribution. The government's stipulation of "whoever plants, harvests" also includes landlords and rich peasants.

　　Does joining the army count as labor? Does hiring laborers at home count as exploitation?
    Ping Shan Zhang Shi Long, Fuping Liu Zhenhua, Huailai Wang Ziheng, Jingquan 7th Brigade Political Department Zhang Zhenhua, Comrade Yun Yu:
    Your letters all involve the question of personal status after joining the army and the treatment that should be given to your family. We will answer them together as follows:
    According to the central government's documents, anyone who is a laborer at home and joins the People's Liberation Army immediately obtains the status of a revolutionary soldier. All revolutionary soldiers are part of the working class and the laboring people. If the family of a revolutionary soldier lacks labor and rents out land or hires laborers to cultivate the land, it should not be considered an act of exploitation. People from landlord or rich peasant families who are allowed to join the People's Liberation Army for one year or engage in revolutionary work for two years can also obtain the status of revolutionary soldiers or revolutionary staff members. Even if their immediate family members are landlords or rich peasants, they can be treated as family members of revolutionary soldiers or revolutionary staff members. According to this regulation, as mentioned in your letter, if a household cultivated the land themselves before their brother or son joined the army and there was no other exploitation, then hiring a long-term laborer to cultivate the land after joining the army due to lack of labor should not be considered exploitation and classified as rich peasant status. Incorrectly struggling against them, confiscating their property, or evicting them should be appropriately compensated and resettled. The person who has joined the army, such as Zhang Dao Xiang, should not be classified as a rich peasant. Liu Zhen Hua is a revolutionary soldier who returned home after being demobilized and makes a small profit to support himself. His current status should be classified as a small merchant. It is wrong to classify him as a rich peasant and confiscate his merchandise. It should be returned or compensated quickly. Furthermore, it is also incorrect to suspend his party membership solely on the grounds of being wrongly classified as a rich peasant. The village branch should re-discuss and request instructions from the higher authorities to correct this.——Editor
　　Hiring a long-term worker does not necessarily mean being a rich peasant. Wu Ji Guo Hui Lai, Rao Yang Huang Hou Ru comrades:
    According to your letter, your family does not occupy much land (an average of two to three mu per person). Ten years ago, for special reasons, you hired short-term workers for three months, or because you lacked labor, you hired a long-term worker (one person) for two years, and you hired short-term workers for one or two months during the busy season. After that, you have not hired workers and live by your own labor without other exploitation. Under these circumstances, having only occasional exploitation or not having continuous exploitation for three years should not be classified as rich peasant status. It was a deviation caused by not establishing clear standards for classifying social status to wrongly struggle against you last winter or to take away your land without your consent, which should be corrected.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor
　　Good or bad personal behavior should not affect family status.
    Comrade Du Ji Zhen: Your family relies on its own labor to manage agricultural and sideline production to maintain a living, without exploitation, and should be classified as middle peasant status. If your brother, Du Xiao Jiang, had a proven act of corruption while he was the village chief with mass support, then he should be appropriately handled according to the specific circumstances and the law. If it is proven that he took bullets and ran away after enlisting, he should be persuaded, educated, and mobilized to return to the team and hand over the bullets. His corruption and escape should not be used to change your family's status, demolish the house, and confiscate the property of your home, which is wrong.

　　Village cadres and militia members who sacrificed in the struggle against the enemy also count as martyrs.
    Q: Should the families of village cadres, militia members, and self-defense forces who resolutely and bravely fought against the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan and sacrificed their lives be considered families of martyrs? This situation is common in Xiyang, and may also be common in other places. We hope for an answer.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Zhao Mangxiao, Xiyang County Government)
    A: The families of militia members, village cadres, and self-defense forces who sacrificed their lives in the struggle against the enemy should be considered families of martyrs, just like those who sacrificed their lives in battle on the front lines. Because they also bravely sacrificed their lives for the people in the cruel struggle against the enemy.

　　Should the performance of old operas be completely prohibited?
    Q: In Neiqiu County, the government has prohibited the performance of old operas for many years, saying that old operas contain feudal and superstitious poison. However, recently, a new association was established in my county seat, and they spent a lot of money to invite a group of old opera performers from Xingtai City to perform in the city for three days. Since then, old operas have been performed at various gatherings in my county. I think that in the past, old operas were not allowed to be performed, but now they are being performed again. Should the performance of old operas be prohibited? I am confused about this issue. Please answer.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Ning Xiuwen, Zhao Zhuang Elementary School, Neiqiu)
    A: Old operas must be reformed. Recently, our region is preparing to establish a Drama and Music Work Committee to start reviewing old opera scripts, stipulating which scripts are permitted to be performed and which are not, and revising old opera scripts to provide new opera scripts. We should adopt a positive reform approach to old operas. Simply using administrative orders to prohibit them is inappropriate.

　　To Readers in Various Places:
    When you inquire with our newspaper about the issue of classifying social status, please be sure to clearly write down the following points for us to answer: (1) When did your village establish a democratic government? (2) How many mu of land does your village have per person on average? (3) How many laborers are there in your family, and how many people participate in the main labor? (4) When did renting out land or hiring laborers start and when did it stop? (5) What is the state of your family's assets (land, draft animals, agricultural tools, and various incomes from other industrial, commercial, and sideline businesses)?

    询问与答覆
　　贪污和工作中的错误不应混淆　地富已变成份不应称“下降户”
    问：一、贪污和错误应否合在一起：去冬搞土改为了搬掉石头好发动群众，但个别群众又为了多清算多分东西，却把旧干部的贪污和错误扩大，而清算了他们。现在为了弄清是非，帮助新干部清理他们的贪污，但确有实据的贪污不大，清算他们的东西多，许多事情是连系到作风和错误上，因此新干部不愿如数退给，就多留下一部，（个别县区干部也如此）但被清算的旧干部却搞不通思想，（强调错误不能和贪污混合）因此也影响了村内团结，这类情形不少，到底该怎样办？请解释明白才好。
    二、“下降户”的名词是否还要？由于去冬开始搞土改时，对划成份没明确指示，因而多年下降的地主富农多被清算和扫地出门。以后经过明确指示，改订了成份（中农或贫农），但村里新农会搞不通（工作组同志们也有搞不通思想的）。却给他们改名为“下降户”，清算的东西不应退，只是可照顾他们的生活，因此就叫他们“下降中农”，下降……户，东西既不能多退，又不愿多照顾，时间拉长了，他们生活比一般也困难了，有些影响了村内团结（村内旧干部部分和被清算户联成一致）。
    不了解这“下降户”名词是否合适，是否等于给他们扣了一个小帽子？对于团结他们感觉有些不妥当，到底该怎样？希详解答。（灵寿　吕甄才）
    答：一、整党中党员犯错误和贪污应严格分清。不能把错误与贪污连系起来，群众想多分东西扩大党员干部的错误和贪污是不对的。领导上处理这些问题应该坚持正确原则，贪污一定要确有证据而不能臆猜，同时有多少是多少，决不能加多扩大。去冬弄错了，现在应该根据事实，该清理的清理，该退回的退回，有些因作风不好而被错算或多算的，都应一律退回（错算的或多算的），新干部想多留一部分而不如数退回是不对的，应该教育他们认清整党的正确目的，说服他们根据政策办事，老干部也不应借机报复，应识大体，做到党员群众新老干部的一致团结。
    二、民主政府成立后，地主停止剥削参加劳动满五年，富农停止剥削满三年，即可改变为农民成份。不应称为下降户或下降中农等。但如果确系地主富农下降的仍保有许多封建财产者，在土改中交出其多余的财产并不算错，按政策规定，重订成份时应改变其成份，但其已被没收或征收之财产，如系多余部分，可不退还。但若没收或征收时，其财产已仅及或不及一般中农水平而无多余部分的，则不应没收或征收，如已没收或征收则应补足其一份。如你们所说：你村多年下降的地主富农被清算或扫地出门，改订成份后，一律加上个“下降户”该退还而不退，是不对的，浮财少的地主富农下降的中农户，如未分可退还，如已分了，也要补偿到他能够生活和生产。
　　脑力劳动所得政府一定保护
    问：地富家庭出身的小学教员，靠脑力劳动，所挣代价，在今年所置买的牛，秋后实行抽补时，是否也没收或征收？！
    地主富农今年生产的粮食，秋后抽补时，是不是没收或征收？（柏乡中兴村朱星三）
    答：如你所说地富家庭出身的小学教员，劳动所得置买的牛，在土地改革中是不在被没收或征收之列的。因为土地改革要消灭的是封建剥削制度。脑力劳动所得的财产，自然要受到民主政府的法律保护。
    地主富农今年劳动生产的粮食，根据谁种谁收的原则，秋后即便抽补，亦不予没收征收。政府所规定之谁种谁收，地主富农也包括在内。

　　参军算不算劳动？　家里雇工算不算剥削？
    平山张式垄阜平刘振华、怀来王子亨、景泉七旅政治部张振华、蕴玉同志：
    你们的来信都涉及参军后本人的成份及其家属应得待遇的问题，一并答复如下：
    据中央文件规定，凡在家是劳动者，参加人民解放军后，本人即可取得革命军人的成份，所有革命军人都是工人阶级和劳动人民的一部分；革命军人的家属，因缺乏劳动力而出租或雇工耕种土地不得认为剥削行为。地主富农家庭出身的人，被允许参加人民解放军一年以后或参加革命工作二年以后，亦可取得革命军人或革命职员的成份，其直系家属虽为地主富农成份，亦可按照革命军人或革命职员的家属待遇。根据这个规定，照你们来信所说，某户在兄弟或儿子未参军前土地是自己耕种，没有其他剥削，参军后因缺乏劳力才雇一个长工耕种，不应认为有剥削而订成富农成份，已错斗没收或扫地出门，应作适当的补偿及安置，其已参军的本人如张道祥，更不应划成富农。刘振华是革命军人复员回家作小买卖维持生活，现在的成份应订为小商贩，将他划成富农并没收其商品财物是错误的，应迅速退还或补偿。此外，如无其他原因仅以错划成富农而停止其党籍也是不对的，该村支部应重新讨论请示上级给予改正。——编者
　　雇过长工不一定是富农无极郭会来、饶阳黄后如同志：
    据来信所谈，你们家占有的土地不多（平均每人二三亩地），十年以前因特殊原因雇过短工三个月，或因为无劳力雇过两年长工（一人），及农忙时雇过一两月短工，以后就一直没有雇过工，无其他剥削，靠自己劳动生活。照这样情形，只有过偶然的剥削或没有连续剥削过三年，不能划为富农成份。去冬将你们错斗了或不得本人同意而把地抽走了，这是没有订成份明确标准所发生的偏向，应该改正。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
　　个人行为好坏不能影响家庭成份
    杜计振同志：你家靠自己劳动，经营农、副业生产维持生活，没有剥削，应是中农成份。你兄弟杜小将当村长时，如经过群众检举并证明确有贪污行为时，应按具体情形依法作适当的处理，他参军后如经证明确系携带子弹逃跑回家，应很好说服教育动员其归队及交回子弹。不得因他的贪污及逃跑行为而改变你家的成份，拆毁房子及没收你家内财产，是不对的。

　　对敌斗争牺牲的村干民兵也算烈士
    问：抗战时期坚决勇敢对敌斗争所牺牲的村干民兵自卫队，其家庭算不算烈属呢？昔阳这种情况很多，各地可能也不少，望答复为盼。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（昔阳县府赵忙小）
    答：对敌斗争中牺牲的民兵、村干、自卫队家属，和在前线战斗中牺牲的应同样算烈属。因为他们也是在和敌人的残酷斗争中为人民而英勇牺牲的。

　　唱旧戏是否应一律禁止？
    问：我内邱县历年来政府就禁止演旧剧，说旧剧都是带有封建迷信毒素，但最近我县城内立了一个新会，花了很多钱请邢台市一班旧戏，在城内唱了三天。从此引起我县各个会上都唱起旧戏来了。我想过去不叫唱旧戏，现在又叫唱了，对唱旧戏到底该不该禁止呢？我对这个问题闹不清，请答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　（内邱赵庄小学宁修文）
    答：旧戏必须改造，最近我区正筹备成立戏剧音乐工作委员会，拟着手审定旧戏目，规定许可演和不许可演的剧本，并修改旧戏本供给新戏本等工作，我们对旧戏应采取积极改革的方针，单纯用行政命令来禁止是不妥当的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者   
　　各地读者：
    你们向本报询问划成份问题时，务须将下列几点写清楚以便作答：（一）你村何时成立民主政府。（二）你村每人平均土地几亩。（三）你家有几个劳动力，几人参加主要劳动。（四）出租地或雇工耕种何时开始何时停止。（五）你家庭的占有情况（土地、耕畜、农具及其他工商业副业各项收入）。
