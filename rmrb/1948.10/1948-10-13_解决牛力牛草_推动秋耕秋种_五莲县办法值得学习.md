Xinhua News Agency, East China, October 10th: Solving the problem of cattle power and cattle feed is one of the important conditions for organizing autumn cultivation and planting. The experience of Wulian County, Shandong Province (newly established county, southern Zhucheng), is worth introducing. Based on the experience of spring plowing and summer planting this year, the county party committee proposed, long before the autumn harvest, that cattle feed must be seriously resolved, livestock power organized, livestock power protected, and everyone encouraged to buy cattle. The districts implemented the county party committee's call, paying attention to solving the problem of fair and reasonable use of plowing cattle, organizing livestock power, and thus smoothly carrying out autumn cultivation and planting. The county's methods for organizing livestock power are: (1) Borrowing cattle from relatives and friends in various villages. (2) People cooperating with cattle to pull the plow (people pulling the plow alone is not deep enough). (3) Hiring cattle for plowing, plowing one large mu (equivalent to three mu) a day and giving one dou of sorghum, which is beneficial to both the cattle owner and the plowman. (4) With the township as the unit, appropriately adjusting the cattle power and helping neighboring villages with plowing for compensation. In organizing the use of cattle power, the county universally proposed the slogan "Love cattle like you would want to be loved, treat them heart to heart". In order to solve the problem of cattle feed, the county has adopted the following methods: (1) Plowing one large mu of land and giving the cattle owner 100 jin of grass throughout the year. This method is more disadvantageous to the cattle owner. Now, in some places, it has been changed to giving the cattle owner 150 to 200 jin of grass for plowing one large mu of land throughout the year, or 100 jin of grass plus 15 to 18 jin of grain. (2) Private cattle, public burden, public use system. This method has two types: one is to give the cattle owner 200 jin of grass for plowing one large mu, and each large mu bears 6 jin of grain for raising cattle. The other is to concentrate cattle feed by group (including the cattle owner's own grass). All sorghum leaves, bean stalks, etc., that grow in the fields and can feed cattle are concentrated, and are not allowed to be sold or burned; if it is still not enough, organize labor to cut green grass. (3) Classification stipulations. The cattle are divided into three grades: upper, middle, and lower. The amount of grass the cattle eat and the number of mu that should be plowed are also divided into three grades accordingly: upper-grade cattle eat 4,000 jin of grass throughout the year and plow 35 large mu of land; middle-grade cattle eat 3,300 jin of grass throughout the year and plow 25 large mu of land; lower-grade cattle eat 2,500 jin of grass throughout the year and plow 15 mu of land. The land for giving cattle feed is also divided into three types: 200 jin per large mu of upper-grade land throughout the year, 150 jin for middle-grade land, and 100 jin for lower-grade land. (4) Cattle labor is converted into manual labor or grain and grass. Some places stipulate that two manual labor days are equivalent to one cattle labor day, and the cattle household feeds the cattle grass, and the manual labor is in charge of meals. Some places stipulate that one cattle labor day is exchanged for 10 jin of grain. (5) Calculated by day. Casual use of livestock (such as delivering manure) can be calculated by day, 15 jin, 20 jin to 25 jin per day. The above methods are used interchangeably in various places. However, all standards must be negotiated by the masses themselves based on local conditions to achieve fairness and mutual benefit, and cannot be forced to be uniform.

　　解决牛力牛草
    推动秋耕秋种
    五莲县办法值得学习
    【新华社华东十日电】解决牛力牛草问题，是组织秋耕秋种的重要条件之一。山东五莲县（新设县，诸城南部）的经验值得介绍。该县县委根据今年春耕夏种经验，远在秋收前即提出必须认真解决牛草，组织畜力，爱护畜力，鼓励大家买牛。各区执行县委号召，注意解决公平合理地使用耕牛问题，组织了畜力，因而顺利进行了秋耕秋种。该县组织畜力的办法为：（一）向各村亲戚朋友借牛。（二）人配合牛拉犁（单是人拉犁不深）。（三）雇牛耕种，独耕一天耕一大亩（合三亩）给一斗秫秫，这样对牛主和耕主都有利。（四）以乡为单位，适当地调剂牛力，有代价地帮助邻村耕种。在组织使用牛力中，该县普遍提出“使牛爱牛，将心比心”的口号。为了解决牛草问题，该县所采取的有以下几种办法：（一）耕一大亩地，全年交牛主一百斤草。这办法牛主比较吃亏，现在有的地方改为全年耕一大亩地给牛主一百五十至二百斤草，或一百斤草外加十五斤至十八斤粮食。（二）私牛公担公使制。这办法又有两种：一种是除耕一大亩给牛主二百斤草外，每大亩负担养牛粮食六斤。另一种是按组集中牛草（牛主自已的草也在内），凡地里所长的能喂牛的高粱叶、豆秸等都集中起来，不准卖，不准烧；如仍不够，另组织劳动力割青草。（三）分等规定。即将牛分为上中下三等，牛吃草的数量及所应耕亩数亦按此分为上中下三等：上牛全年吃草四千斤，耕地卅五大亩；中牛全年吃草三千三百斤，耕地二十五大亩；下牛全年吃草二千五百斤，耕地十五亩。给牛草的地也分三种：全年每大亩上地出二百斤，中地出一百五十斤，下地出一百斤。（四）牛工折人工或粮草。有些地方规定两个人工顶一个牛工，牛草牛户喂，人工管饭。有些地方规定一个牛工换十斤粮。（五）按天计算。零使牲口（如送粪）可按天计算，每天十五斤、二十斤至二十五斤。以上各种办法，各地都交互采用。但各种标准均需根据当地情况由群众自己商定，作到公平互利，不能强求一致。
