Taihang Telegram: Wuan, Zuoquan, Pingshun, Licheng and other counties in the hinterland are actively rectifying people's armed organizations, combining autumn harvest and wheat planting to intensify war preparations. During the preparation, through conducting education on current events and future tasks, the ideas of peace, complacency, fear of danger and hardship among the militia and the masses were resolved. Emphasis was placed on resolving the production problems of the militia and laborers participating in the war, as well as the scientific organization and rational use of labor. The Wuan County Government and the Military Affairs Committee jointly instructed all villages to resolve the outstanding issues in war support work, to settle the unpaid work points of past war participation, and stipulated two measures: First, militia and laborers participating in the war earn one work point per day, paid according to the local rice price. If old accounts cannot be traced, the settlement period will be from the time of participation in the war last year. Second, militia expenses: if the village has armed construction funds, it will be paid from this fund; otherwise, the village finance will uniformly reimburse it. Gun oil, lamp oil, pens, paper, ink, etc., can be budgeted, but must be reviewed by the district and filed with the county. Excessive demands from the militia, such as unreasonable expenses like making military uniforms, should be strictly rejected and waste is not allowed. After the announcement of this method, the enthusiasm of the villagers, militia and masses to participate in the war was enhanced. The militia in the Eighth District said: "Participating in the war can reasonably offset work, solve family problems, and we'll go whenever we're called." Wang Fuyou of Heyan Village, Zuoquan said: "In the past, when I participated in the war, I was always worried about the seedlings in the field, afraid they would be neglected; but when I came back, I saw that they had all been weeded, and not a single piece of land was neglected." Soon, two echelons of war participants were quickly organized, and they hurried to harvest and plant wheat in preparation for the war. The Military Affairs Committee of the Fourth District of Pingshun also convened a meeting of armed cadres from various villages on September 14 to determine the method of combining production and intensifying war preparations. After the Hongni Village in the Sixth District of the county convened a meeting of the militia self-defense force and women, 118 members of the militia self-defense force formed two echelons to participate in the war, led by the director and instructor of the Military Affairs Committee respectively. The women also helped the single men participating in the war to make clothes and shoes. Nangangou, Licheng, especially convened an emergency mobilization meeting on September 14 to prepare for war and conduct the autumn harvest. From accurately calculating the village's manpower and livestock, it was decided to develop the experience of organizing women last year, and to inform the militia and laborers at the front to harvest in autumn, so that they can participate in the war with peace of mind. The women of the village have made 80 pairs of shoes and socks and 78 cotton clothes for the laborers and militia participating in the war, ensuring that those supporting the front will not suffer difficulties.

　　太行腹地整顿武装组织
    结合收种准备参战
    【太行电】武安、左权、平顺、黎城等腹地县份积极整顿人民武装组织，结合秋收种麦，加紧参战准备。在准备中，经过进行时事与前途任务教育，解决了民兵与群众中和平、自满、怕危险吃苦等思想，并着重解决了参战民兵民工的生产问题，及科学组织合理使用劳力问题。武安县政府与武委会联合指示各村，解决战勤工作中的遗留问题，清算过去未曾清算的参战工帐，并规定二项办法：一、民工民兵参战一天顶一工，按当地米价付资。旧帐无法追究时，以去年参战以来为清算期限。二、民兵开支问题：村中有武装建设费者，即在该项经费中开支；否则由村财政统一报销。枪油、灯油、笔、纸、墨等，可作预算，但得经区审查，县备案。民兵有过分要求如做军衣等不合理开支，应严格拒绝，不准浪费。此项办法公布后，各村民兵群众参战情绪提高。八区民兵说：“参战能合理顶工，解决家庭问题，叫啥时去就啥时去。”左权壑岩村王福有说：“我过去参战总是挂念地里的苗子，怕荒了；结果回来一看，全帮助给锄了，没荒一分地。”随着即很快组织起两个参战梯队，赶紧收秋种麦，准备参战。平顺四区武委会亦于九月十四日召开各村武装干部会议，确定了结合生产，加紧参战准备的办法。该县六区虹霓村召开民兵自卫队及妇女会议后，民兵自卫队一百十八人，组成两个参战梯队，由武委会主任、指导员分别带队。妇女亦帮助参战的光棍汉做好衣鞋。黎城南港沟特于九月十四日召开紧急动员准备参战、进行秋收会议，从精确计算全村人力畜力，决定发扬去年组织妇女的经验，并告给到前方的民兵民工收秋，使他们安心参战。该村妇女已给参战民工民兵做好了八十双鞋袜，七十八件棉衣，保证不让参战支前者受了困难。
