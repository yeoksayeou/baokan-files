Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: The Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Bureau has summarized its work from the past six months and made arrangements for timber felling tasks this winter. In the past six months, the bureau has basically completed its tasks. In the first half of the year, a total of 153,353 large railway sleepers were sent. In addition, 26,700 cubic meters of railway sleepers are expected to be completed by the end of September. In order to develop forestry, the bureau repaired 33 kilometers of light railways and built 23 kilometers of new ones. The bureau has also established systems for monthly reports, seal imprints, delivery orders, new accounting books, and vouchers. Due to the development of the workers' movement, it has played a significant role in felling operations. For example, unused coal from the former lumberyards was utilized, and road workers also paid attention to collecting track spikes and scrap iron. The summary stipulates that future tasks should first fully utilize the favorable conditions for winter felling operations and strive to fell 490,450 cubic meters of materials and 490,000 railway sleepers. Secondly, it is necessary to accurately calculate costs, formulate production plans, establish and implement various necessary systems, oppose departmentalism, guerrillaism, and anarchic state, unify revenue and expenditure and supply, and gradually achieve enterprise management. In addition, decisions were also made on issues such as strengthening organizational structures, cultivating technical talents, and launching the workers' movement.

　　黑龙江林务局总结半年工作
    发送枕木十五万根　
    【新华社东北二十二日电】黑龙江省林务局总结半年来的工作，布置今冬采伐任务。半年来该局基本上完成了任务，总计上半年共发送大枕木十五万三千三百五十三根。此外至九月末尚能完成枕木二万六千七百立方米。该局为发展林务，修复了轻便铁道三十三公里，新建了二十三公里。该局并已建立了月报、号印、提货单、新帐簿、传票等制度。由于职工运动的开展，对采伐作业起了不少作用，如利用了过去贮木场不用的煤，路工也注意检道钉、废铁等。总结中规定今后任务首先是充分利用冬季采伐作业的有利条件，为采伐四十九万零四百五十立方米用料、四十九万根枕木而奋斗。其次为精密核算成本，拟定生产计划，制订与贯彻各种必要制度，反对本位主义、游击主义及无政府状态，统一收支与供给，逐步达到企业化。此外，关于加强组织机构，培养技术人材，展开职工运动等问题亦作出决定。
