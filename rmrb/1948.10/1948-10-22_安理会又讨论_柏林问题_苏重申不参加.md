Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Reports from various sources: Soviet representative to the UN General Assembly, Vyshinsky, reiterated the Soviet Union's position of not participating in the Security Council's discussion of the so-called Berlin issue when the Security Council resumed its discussion on the Berlin issue on the 15th. Vyshinsky pointed out that, according to the Charter, the issue of Berlin and the entire German question should be resolved by the Council of Four Foreign Ministers and has nothing to do with the Security Council. Since the Security Council adjourned on the 6th, the acting chairman, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, has conducted a series of so-called "mediation" activities during the nine-day adjournment. Bramuglia maintained close contact with the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, the latter holding secret talks twice on the 11th and 14th. In his address on the 15th, Bramuglia requested the four countries to provide information on the restriction of traffic between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, as well as the reasons why the instructions of the four countries to the governors were not implemented. According to United Press, Bramuglia's motive in raising the questions was to induce the Soviet Union to get involved in the discussion of the Berlin issue. After pointing out this trick, Vyshinsky declared that the recently published documents of the Soviet Union have clarified all the issues. The Soviet Union believes that there is no need to present more materials on these two issues. The speeches and attitudes of other Western countries in the Security Council were very awkward. Representatives of Canada, Colombia, and Syria agreed with the United States' position on including the Berlin issue in the Security Council's agenda, but had to admit that it was a violation of the Charter.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS, New York, 16th: The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship issued a statement accusing the US government of creating the current world tension and calling for negotiations with the Soviet Union. The statement pointed out that submitting this issue to the Security Council for discussion can only increase world tension. The core of international tension is the unwillingness of the United States to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union on an equal footing to resolve the major differences between the two countries. Accompanied by war propaganda, the United States has formulated a huge rearmament plan not only for itself but also for the entire Western world. The statement further stated that the Soviet Union's just disarmament plan and proposals for international control of atomic energy concretely demonstrate the Soviet Union's desire for peace. The committee called on all peace-loving forces to do everything possible to stop the "Cold War" and force the US government to start negotiations with the Soviet Union.

　　安理会又讨论“柏林问题”
  　苏重申不参加
    【新华社陕北廿日电】各方报导：苏联出席联大代表团团长维辛斯基十五日在安理会恢复讨论所谓柏林问题时，重申苏联不参加安理会讨论柏林问题的立场。维氏指出，根据宪章，柏林及整个德国问题应由四外长会议解决，与安理会无关。安理会于六日休会以来，在九天休会期间，代理主席阿根廷外长布拉玛葛里亚曾进行一系列的所谓“调解”活动。布氏与美英法三国代表保持密切的接触，后者曾于十一与十四两日两度举行秘密会谈。布氏十五日在致词中要求四国提供关于限制柏林与西占区交通的经过及四国致总督训令未能实行原因的情报。据合众社透露，布氏提出问题的动机在于诱使苏联卷入柏林问题的讨论，维辛斯基在指出这一诡计之后宣称：苏联最近公布的文件，已将一切问题说明清楚。苏联认为对此两项问题，无须提出更多的材料。其他西方国家在安理会的发言、态度很是尴尬。加拿大、哥伦比亚、叙利亚代表一面同意美国将柏林问题列入安理会的立场，但又不得不承认这是违反宪章的。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美苏友谊协会全国委员会发表声明，指责美国政府造成目前世界紧张情势，并呼吁与苏联举行谈判。声明指出：将这一问题提交安理会讨论只能更增加世界的紧张局势。国际紧张局势的中心一环，是美国不愿在平等原则上同苏联直接谈判解决两国的主要分歧。伴随着战争宣传，美国不仅为自己而且为整个西方世界制定了巨大的重整军备计划。声明更称：苏联公正的裁军计划及国际管制原子能的建议，具体地表明了苏联愿望和平的事实。该委员会号召一切爱好和平的力量竭尽全力以制止“冷战”，并迫使美国政府与苏联开始谈判。
