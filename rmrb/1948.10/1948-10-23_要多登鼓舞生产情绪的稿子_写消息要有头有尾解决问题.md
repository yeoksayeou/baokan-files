　　Publish More Articles Encouraging Production Enthusiasm
  　Write News Reports with a Beginning and End to Solve Problems
    Comrades Editors: I have some suggestions for the newspaper: First, I hope that more articles will be published in the future to stabilize production enthusiasm. As far as I know, many people in many places are still not enthusiastic about production, and they do not understand the policies thoroughly. Even in places where corrections have been made, the masses' thinking is very complicated. Some time ago, the Taihang District Party Committee's "Understanding and Guidelines" on the land reform situation in the Taihang District said that production had mostly stabilized. This is also true, because it is slightly better than before (spring), but this does not mean that it is completely better. Many people still have concerns, which may be a major obstacle to production. Therefore, I suggest that the Party newspaper should not only positively publicize the Party's policies, but also publish more specific materials.
    Second, the masses or cadres welcome well-organized and complete news reports, from which they can understand others and guide themselves. For example, I think the news about the Wutai Transportation Cooperative on page two of your newspaper on the fourth of this month does not meet this requirement. It simply talks about achievements without mentioning the organizational situation of the transportation cooperative, so people don't understand what's going on or how the achievements were made after reading it.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Wei Ming)
    Answer: Your opinions are very correct and important. In the past period, there have been many reports on publicizing unity and production, but there has not been enough focus on addressing the masses' ideological sentiments, using specific examples to dispel the masses' concerns, and at the same time reflecting various difficulties in production and ways to overcome them.
    In terms of selecting and organizing manuscripts, there are indeed few reports with a beginning, end, and process, which is a serious shortcoming in our reporting. We hope that readers from all over will frequently offer opinions and requests to help us improve.

    Comrades Editors: I have a suggestion for the newspaper: There are too few literary reports, such as the heroic deeds of the front-line battles, the production creations of various departments in the rear, and models and heroes. In line with the current tasks, there should be some encouraging and majestic songs, which will have a huge effect on production enthusiasm.　　　　　(Reader Yang Jie)
    Answer: Our newspaper has now added four pages. We will try our best to adopt literary creations and songs that reflect the heroic deeds, inventions, and creations of war and production. We hope that readers from all over will actively contribute. (Editor)

### 要多登鼓舞生产情绪的稿子　写消息要有头有尾解决问题

　　要多登鼓舞生产情绪的稿子
  　写消息要有头有尾解决问题
    编辑同志：我对报纸有点建议：一、希望以后多登安定生产情绪的稿子，据我了解，许多地方群众对生产仍不起劲，对政策不登底，就是纠偏后的地方，群众思想也很复杂。前些时太行区党委对于太行区土改情况的“了解和方针”消息说大都生产安定了，这样说也对，因为比以前（春天）就是稍好了，但这并不等于已经完全好了，许多人还有顾虑，这可能是生产上的一大障碍。因此，我建议党报一面要正面的宣传党的政策，一面则应多登些具体的材料。
    二、群众或干部是欢迎有条理有头有尾的消息的，从其中了解别人，指导自己。比如贵报本月四号二版五台运输社消息，我认为就不合乎这要求，单纯的说些成绩，没说运输社的组织情形，因此使人看了，就不了解是怎回事，怎样得来的成绩。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未明）
    答：你的意见很对，很重要。过去一时期，宣传团结生产的报导是很多的，但针对群众的思想情绪，以具体事例打破群众顾虑，同时反映生产中各种困难，及克服困难的办法等等，这一方面的确不够。
    在选用及组织稿件方面，有头尾有过程的报导少，也是事实，这是我们报导中的一个严重缺点。望各地读者经常提出意见和要求，帮助我们改进。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（编者）
    编辑同志：我对报纸有个建议：文艺性报导太少，如前方战斗的英雄事迹、后方各部门的生产创造及模范与英雄，配合当前任务应有些鼓动的雄壮的歌曲，这对生产热情是有巨大作用的。　　　　　（读者杨洁）
    答：本报现已增出四版，反映战争生产各方面英雄事迹发明创造的文艺创作及歌曲当尽量采用，望各地读者踊跃投稿。（编者）
