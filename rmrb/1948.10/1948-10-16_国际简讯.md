　　International Briefs
    (1) After the Soviet representative announced that he would not participate in the Security Council's discussion on the Berlin issue, the American plan suffered a head-on blow. The council decided on the 6th not to adjourn sine die. During the recess, the acting chairman of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, under the instigation of the United States, carried out various so-called "mediation" activities. On the 8th, Bramuglia met alone with the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky. United Nations Secretary-General Lie also met with Vyshinsky on the 8th. The "mediation" activities are still continuing.
    (2) The British Conservative Party Congress was held in Llandudno from the 6th to the 9th. Warmonger Churchill delivered a pro-American and anti-Soviet speech at the meeting.
