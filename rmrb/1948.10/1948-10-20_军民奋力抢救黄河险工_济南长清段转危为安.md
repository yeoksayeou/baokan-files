　　Military and Civilians Work Together to Rescue the Yellow River Project
  　Jinan's Changqing Section Turns from Danger to Safety
    The dangerous sections of the Yellow River in Jinan and Changqing have been turned from danger to safety thanks to the efforts of the military and civilians along the river. When the dangerous sections of the river were in critical condition due to the surge in the Yellow River's water level at the beginning of this month, the Jinan Special Municipal Military Control Commission immediately mobilized and gathered more than 21,000 gunny sacks and more than 4,000 grass bags, and rushed to transport some of them to Beidianzi (more than 40 miles west of Jinan), Luankou and other places for use. The municipal government mobilized more than 2,500 civilian workers, and the garrison command dispatched a large number of troops to cooperate with the masses along the river to participate in the rescue project. Geng Guangbo, Deputy Director of the Department of Industry of Shandong Provincial Government, Yuan Zhongxian, Commander of the Jinan Garrison, and Xu Bing, Deputy Mayor, all personally went to the dangerous sections to supervise the military and civilians in the repair work. Most of the former employees of the Shandong Provincial Repair and Defense Office of the Kuomintang also reported to the Industry Department of the Jinan Military Control Commission and actively participated in the repair and defense work. The Fujiabao (30 miles northeast of Jinan) dangerous section in the lower reaches of the section, due to the loose sandy soil and the lack of stone, the Yellow River water directly hit the water diversion dam. The second water diversion dam was washed away three times, and the third was washed away five times. People's Liberation Army cooperated with civilian workers and river workers to repair them day and night, and added crescent dams, sweep dams and other projects, and finally became consolidated. As of the 9th, more than 120 dangerous sections in the section from Beidianzi in the upper reaches to Hujia'an (70 miles northeast of Jinan) in the lower reaches, a distance of about 120 miles, have been largely completed. Now civilian workers are continuing to repair and consolidate the dikes. The Yellow River water level at 6:00 pm on the 10th had dropped to 29.83 meters (the highest was 31.27 meters), which is equal to the water level during the summer flood season this year. In addition, the dangerous sections in Huimin, Lijin, Putai, and Gaoqing (newly established county, merged from Gaoyuan and Qingcheng) in the Bohai Sea area in the lower reaches are all stable. The democratic governments of the counties are still mobilizing the masses to actively repair them to prevent accidents.

　　军民奋力抢救黄河险工
  　济南长清段转危为安
    【新华社华东十八日电】济南、长清段黄河险工，在沿河军民奋力抢救下，刻已转危为安。当该段险工因本月初黄河水势暴涨而告急时，济南特别市军事管制委员会立即动员集中麻袋二万一千余条、草包四千余个，并先赶运一部往北店子（济南以西四十余里）、滦口等处应用。市政府则动员民工二千五百余人，警备司令部调派大批部队，配合沿河群众投入抢险工程。山东省政府实业厅副厅长耿光波、济市警备司令袁仲贤及副市长徐冰等均亲赴各险工督率军民抢修。前国民党山东省修防处员工亦大部向济市军管会实业部报到，积极参加修防工作。该段下游傅家庄（济南东北卅里）险工，因沙土地松，石料又缺，致黄水直冲挑水坝，第二号挑水坝被冲塌三次，第三号被冲塌五次，均经人民解放军协同民工河工日夜抢修，并增设月牙坝、埽坝等工程，终趋巩固。至九日止，从上游北店子到下游胡家岸（济南东北七十里）段约一百二十余里中一百二十多个险工已大体修竣，现民工正继续加修巩固堤防。黄河水位十日下午六时已降至二十九点八三公尺（最高时为三十一点二七公尺），与今年夏汛期水位相等。又下游渤海区惠民、利津、蒲台、高青（新设县，高苑、青城合并）各险工均告平稳。现各县民主政府仍动员群众积极整修，以防意外。
