　　【Taiyue Electric】The Yicheng Third District is working on studying leadership methods to strengthen leadership over production work. On September 28th, cadres from the district gathered to report on the production situation in various places, but the reports were fragmented and piecemeal, failing to raise or solve problems. For example, Comrade Li Peiwen reported on the work of three administrative villages in the mountains, saying: "There is a transportation team in Xiyan that earned more than 400,000 [currency unit]; there is also a carpentry team that earned more than 300,000 [currency unit] in a month. A mutual aid team in Yuanzhiping is doing a good job and has already started autumn plowing." But when the Deputy Secretary of the Sub-District Committee, Comrade Wu Xiangting, asked: "How are these teams organized and led? What problems are there? What do they transport regularly?" Comrade Li stammered and could not answer, only saying, "I'm not very clear about that; the Production Director of Xiyan mentioned it." Cultural and Educational Assistant Ma Libang said: "The cadres of Guandiping Administrative Village are lying down and not working; only the village chief is working. One day, a cadre meeting was not even finished before everyone automatically dispersed." Comrade Wu Xiangting asked: "Why aren't these village cadres working? How can we motivate them to lead production?" But Comrade Ma couldn't answer, only saying, "There's no way." These kinds of phenomena are very common, either a pile of dry numbers, or abstract conclusions, or repeating materials from the previous report. As for what problems were actually discovered in the work, and how they were solved? This has not been done or has been done very little, so most people can't answer. But they are actually very busy, running around every day, busily collecting materials, taking notes, and reporting, but they haven't paid attention to the effectiveness of their work, or they don't know the methods of work, so the work effectiveness is very low. In addition, there are also a few individuals who intentionally adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the higher authorities, giving a little bit at a time. In order to overcome this problem, the Third District Committee, after everyone's research, came up with a new approach: First, every comrade must take a serious and responsible attitude, strengthen research and analysis, discover problems, and solve problems, and therefore requires every comrade to think more and deliberate more. Second, develop a thorough, meticulous and arduous style, go deep into the masses, go to the fields to inspect, and after discovering problems, discuss solutions with the masses in accordance with the spirit of the policies, and only hand over problems that cannot be truly solved to the district to solve, and develop the ability to solve problems independently, but must report to the higher authorities. Third, in terms of work methods, there should be a base point, and contact should be made with general villages, going deep into one village to help village cadres organize and lead mass production, and learn from the experience to promote other villages, overcoming the problem of dispersing forces and running around haphazardly.

　　翼城三区研究领导方法
  　加强分析克服乱忙
    【太岳电】翼城三区着手研究领导方法，加强对生产工作的领导。九月二十八日该区干部集会，汇报各地生产情形，都是片片断断零零碎碎的，既提不出问题，又解决不了问题。如李培文同志汇报山后三个行政村工作时说：“西阎有个运输组，赚了四十多万；还有一个木匠组，一月内赚了三十多万元。垣址坪一个互助组搞的不错，已经开始秋耕地了。”但等分委书记吴香亭同志问：“这些组是怎样组织和领导的？里边有什么问题？他们经常运输些什么？”李同志就吞吞吐吐回答不出来，只好说：“这还不大清楚，是西阎的生产主任谈的。”文教助理员马立榜同志谈：“官底坪行政村干部躺倒不干，就是村长一个人干，有一天开干部会还没开完，大家自动散了会。”吴香亭同志问：“这些村干部为啥不做工作？怎样就能使他们积极起来领导生产？”可是马同志就答不上来了，只说了个“没办法”。象这些现象是很普遍的，或者是一堆枯燥的数目字，或者是抽象的结论，或者重复上次汇报的材料。至于在工作中究竟发现了些什么问题，如何解决的？这就没作过或作的很少，因此大多答不上来。但他们实际却是很忙的，每天东跑西跑，到处忙着收集材料、记笔记、汇报，只是他们没注意工作效果，或则不知道工作方法，因此工作效果很低。另外也有个别人是有意对上级采取应付态度，要一点给一点。三区分委为了克服这种毛病，经大家研究出新的作法是：第一、每个同志必须以严肃负责的态度，加强研究分析，发现问题，解决问题，因而要求每个同志多考虑、多思索。第二、并发扬深入细致艰苦的作风，要深入到群众中去，到地里去检查，发现问题后，按照政策精神和群众一块商量解决，真正解决不了的题题，才交区上解决，养成独立解决问题的能力，但须向上级汇报。第三、在工作方法上要有基点，并和一般村联系，深入到一个村子，帮助村干部组织领导群众生产，从中取得经验以推动其他村。克服分散使用力量到处乱跑的毛病。
