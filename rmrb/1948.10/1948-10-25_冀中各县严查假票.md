(Jizhong Electric) The anti-counterfeiting struggle in various parts of central Hebei has been widely and deeply developed in the past month and has achieved preliminary results. Since the Jiang bandits in Tianjin printed counterfeit currency in an attempt to fraudulently obtain materials from the Liberated Areas, the Jizhong Administrative Office issued an emergency instruction, calling on governments at all levels, banks and other economic departments to actively lead the masses in fighting counterfeit currency. The Jizhong Branch, the Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Eighth Administrative Office, and most counties in the Eighth Military Subdistrict have successively issued instructions or convened meetings. Qingxian and Jinghai also organized working groups to provide specific assistance to the districts. The Jianguo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party assigned anti-counterfeiting tasks to each working group, the industrial and commercial departments directly controlled the markets, and the public security departments investigated and understood the situation. Most counties in the Eighth Military Subdistrict convened meetings of market committee directors, accounting associations, and chambers of commerce, as well as forums for industrial and commercial households. The districts separately convened meetings of village cadres, exposing the Jiang bandits' shameless conspiracy to massively print counterfeit currency (currency reform), and specifically explaining the style of the counterfeit currency. After returning to the villages, the village cadres combined this with the current central work, conducting publicity at mass meetings or using radio stations, blackboards, and markets. Street slogans were written in market towns, film screenings were held, and counterfeit currency was posted on the streets, with special personnel helping merchants and residents to identify it. Some people were organized to inspect the markets, and some even set up currency identification tables. If merchants and residents could not identify the currency, cadres from the market committee would help, and the source would be traced after counterfeit currency was discovered or inspected. Jinghai and other counties also had industrial and commercial cadres equipped with cadres from marginal areas to go to various blockades and trade intersections to promote lower-level organizations to carry out blockade and anti-smuggling work, control ferry crossings, and inspect merchants entering and exiting to strictly prevent counterfeit currency from being brought in. After active leadership in various places, the vigilance of merchants and residents has been improved, and they have actively reported counterfeit currency criminals. According to statistics for September, more than 100 counterfeit currency criminals were seized in the entire region. In Jinghai and other eight counties in the Eighth Military Subdistrict alone, 467.23 million yuan of counterfeit currency was found. Counterfeit currency has been greatly reduced in many counties. However, some leading comrades in some areas still have not realized the serious significance of the anti-counterfeiting struggle. Some counties have not made unified arrangements, and some counties are only engaging in it independently through the industrial and commercial departments. In addition, some comrades are satisfied with some current achievements and have relaxed their anti-counterfeiting work. Regarding the above shortcomings, the Eighth Administrative Office and banks have issued instructions, calling on cadres at all levels to raise their vigilance, combine with the eradication of enemy currency, and continue to deeply develop the mass anti-counterfeiting struggle.

　　冀中各县严查假票
    【冀中电】冀中各地反假钞斗争，月来已普遍深入展开，并获得初步成绩。自天津蒋匪印发假钞、阴谋骗取解放区物资后，冀中行署即发出紧急指示，号召各级政府、银行等经济部门，积极领导群众反假钞。冀中分行、中共八地委、八专署及八分区大部县份，均先后发出指示，或召开了会议。青县、静海并组织了工作组，分头到区具体帮助。中共建国县委对每个工作组都布置了反假钞任务，工商部门直接掌握集市，公安部门调查了解，八分区大部县份均召集了集委会主任，会计会及商联会，工商户座谈会等。各区分头召开了村干部会，揭穿了蒋匪（币制改革）大量印发假钞的无耻阴谋，并具体说明假钞式样。村干部回村后，即结合当前中心工作，在群众会上或用广播台、黑板报、集市进行宣传。在集镇上书写街头标语，开片会，并把假钞贴在街上，由专人帮助商民识别。并组织一部分人在集上检查，有的还设了认票桌，商民不能识别的，在集委会干部帮助，发现或检查出假钞后就追根。静海等县则由工商干部配备边缘区干部，分头到各封锁线、贸易路口，推动下层组织进行封锁缉私，掌握摆渡口，检查出入口商人，严防带进假票。经过各地积极领导，提高了商民的警惕，纷纷自动检举假票犯。据九月份统计，全区共查获假票犯一百余个，仅八分区静海等八县，即查出假票四亿六千七百二十三万元。很多县份假钞已大大减少。但某些地区的领导同志，仍未认识到反假钞斗争的严重意义，有的县还未作统一布置，有的县只是工商部门单独搞。此外，还有部分同志满足于现在一些成绩，而放松了反假钞工作。对于上述缺点，八专署及银行等均已发出指示，号召各级干部提高警惕，与肃清敌币结合，继续深入开展群众性的反假票斗争。
