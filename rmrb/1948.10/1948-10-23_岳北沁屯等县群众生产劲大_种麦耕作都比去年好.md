[Taiyue Electricity] The wheat planting work in Tunliu, Qinyuan, Anze, and Changzi counties has been completed, and the cultivation is better than last year. According to statistics from 42 villages in Tunliu, in addition to planting 40,457 mu of regular-crop wheat, 3,474 mu have been converted to wheat. In Qinyuan, in addition to planting the previous year's 30,668 mu, this year the wheat fields have increased by 2,192 mu. In the past, the villages in the second district of Changzi were not accustomed to planting wheat, but this year, in addition to planting the original 1,812 mu of wheat fields, they have also newly increased the wheat fields by 455 mu. In the eastern Sai, Anshang and other fourteen villages in the fourth district of Anze, in addition to completing the 10,713 mu of regular wheat fields, they also planted 1,639 mu of barren wheat and 1,324 mu of converted wheat, which increased the wheat fields by 633 mu compared with last year. This year, the amount of manure applied to wheat fields in various places generally reached an average of 25 to 30 dan. For example, in the villages of the second and fourth districts of Tunliu, the amount of manure applied per mu last year was mostly around 20 dan, but this year it has increased to 25 to 30 dan. In the third district, the average amount of manure applied last year was 30 dan, and this year it has increased to an average of 40 dan. This year, the general average in the first district of Qinyuan is also around 30 dan. According to statistics from the first and second districts of Changzi, it also exceeded previous years, all above 30 dan. In terms of plowing wheat fields, most of them have been plowed twice, and plowing once or four times is individual, and there are not a few who plowed three times. However, the achievements in wheat seed disinfection are not significant. Although the leaders of Tunliu, Qinyuan, Changzi, and Anze paid attention to promotion, only individual villages and individual households implemented water soaking, wine mixing, and oil mixing methods. For example, the Taiyue First Farm Work Team organized the masses in eight villages including Anze Mingchi to soak 263 dan and 8 dou of wheat seeds, which can be used to plant 5,352 mu of wheat fields. The masses in these villages also exchanged 54 dan and 3 dou of wheat seeds with each other. The main reason for not universally implementing seed soaking is that the masses lacked experience in seed soaking in the past. They said, "The seedlings will be soft after being soaked in warm water and will not be drought-resistant," or they find it troublesome. At the same time, the leaders did not sufficiently publicize and explain the benefits of seed soaking to the masses. The reasons why wheat planting in various counties is better this year than in previous years are: First, the counties and districts have universally publicized the specific policies of our region that land rights have been largely determined and that there is no burden for one or two years of planting barren land, so the masses can produce with peace of mind. In addition, the government clearly ordered the suspension of general corvée for one month during the wheat planting season, and the special commissioner's office also lent wheat seeds to each county, including 700 dan for Tunliu, 100 dan for Qinyuan, 400 dan for Changzi, and 100 dan for Anze, as well as wheat planting loans, including 30 million yuan for Tunliu, 27 million yuan for Changzi, 15 million yuan for Anze, and 20 million yuan for Qinyuan, and formulated production incentive measures, which encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for production. In addition, last year the wheat was planted late, and there were many cases of jaundice this year. The masses accepted this lesson, and most of them planted early this year.

　　岳北沁屯等县群众生产劲大
  　种麦耕作都比去年好
    【太岳电】屯留、沁源、安泽、长子四县种麦工作已经全部完毕，耕作都比去年要好。据屯留四十二个村的统计，除种正茬麦四万零四百五十七亩外，还改茬种了三千四百七十四亩。沁源除种了去年的三万零六百六十八亩外，今年增加麦地二千一百九十二亩。长子二区各村过去不习惯种麦，但今年除种了原有麦地一千八百一十二亩外，还新增加了麦地四百五十五亩。安泽四区东赛、安上等十四个村，除完成正茬麦地一万零七百一十三亩外，也种荒地麦一千六百三十九亩，改茬麦一千三百二十四亩，比去年增加麦地六百卅三亩。各地今年麦地上粪一般平均达到了二十五担到三十担。如屯留二区、四区各村，去年每亩上粪多在二十担左右，今年已增到二十五担到三十担。三区去年上粪平均三十担，今年平均增加到四十担。沁源一区今年一般也在三十担左右。据长子一、二区统计，也超过了往年，都在卅担以上。在犁麦地方面，大部分都犁过了两遍，犁一遍和犁四遍都是个别的，犁三遍的也不少。但在麦种消毒方面成绩不大。屯留、沁源、长子、安泽领导上虽注意了提倡，但消毒的只是个别村和个别户实行了水浸、酒拌、油拌等办法。如太岳第一农场工作组，在安泽鸣池等八村，组织了群众浸麦种二百六十三石八斗，可种麦地五千三百五十二亩。这些村群众也互相调剂换了麦种五十四石三斗。没有普遍实行浸种的主要原因，是群众过去缺乏浸种经验，他们说：“温水浸过后将来苗软，不耐旱”，或者嫌麻烦。同时领导上对浸种的好处向群众宣传解释也不够。今年各县种麦比往年好的原因，一是各县区普遍宣传了我区地权大体确定和种荒地一年或二年不负担等具体政策，群众多能安心生产。另外，政府明令种麦时期停止一般性的差务一月，专署又分别贷给各县麦种，计屯留七百石，沁原一百石，长子四百石，安泽一百石，及种麦贷款，计屯留三千万元，长子二千七百万元，安泽一千五百万元，沁源二千万元，并制定了生产奖励办法，鼓舞了群众生产情绪，再加上去年麦子种迟了，今年黄疸病很多，群众接受了这个教训，今年大多提前下种。
