　　Soviet Troops Begin Withdrawal from North Korea
　　Mongolia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia Establish Diplomatic Relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—Reports from various sources: The Soviet Union, keeping its promise to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, began withdrawing its troops from North Korea on October 18th. The people of Wonsan, Haeju, and other places in Korea held warm farewell meetings to see off the Soviet troops who are about to return to their homeland. According to the Tokyo correspondent of the Telegraph Agency, American officials in Tokyo had to admit that the Soviet Union's unconditional decision to withdraw from North Korea had a huge impact on nations fighting for independence. While the Soviet troops, respecting the will of the Korean people, began to withdraw from North Korea, the puppet regime in South Korea intensified its persecution of the South Korean people. The puppet president Syngman Rhee hurriedly flew to Tokyo on the 19th to pay homage to his master, MacArthur, and seek instructions. In Seoul, the American-trained special police have conducted hundreds of arrests of residents. The puppet government, fabricating a communist conspiracy to assassinate the puppet president and prime minister as an excuse, declared martial law in Seoul, inspected telegrams, and put the figures who attended the Pyongyang North-South Korean political parties and leaders conference this year on a black list of wanted persons.

　　In addition, the governments of the Mongolian People's Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have successively established diplomatic relations with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

　　In addition, the League of Korean Residents in Japan held a mass meeting in Tokyo on the 17th to celebrate the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with 4,000 people participating. The conference elected 120 representatives to return to the country to attend a meeting convened by Premier Kim Il-sung.

　　苏军开始撤离北鲜
  　蒙波捷与朝鲜共和国建立外交关系
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：苏联信守对朝鲜人民民主共和国的诺言，已于十月十八日起开始从北朝鲜撤退驻军。元山、海州等地的朝鲜人民，都举行了热烈的欢送会，欢送行将返回祖国的苏军，据电通社东京记者称：东京美国官员不得不承认，苏联所作的无条件地撤离北朝鲜的决定，对于为独立而斗争的民族有着巨大影响。当苏军尊重朝鲜人民意志而开始撤离北朝鲜时，南朝鲜的傀儡政权则加紧了对南朝鲜人民的迫害。傀儡总统李承晚匆匆于十九日飞东京，拜谒其主子麦克阿瑟请示机宜。汉城方面，美国训练的特别警察对居民已进行了数百次的逮捕。傀儡政府捏造共产党阴谋刺杀傀儡总统与总理为借口，宣布汉城戒严，检查电讯，并把今年曾出席平壤南北朝鲜政党领袖会议的人物，都列在通缉的黑名单上。
    又讯：蒙古人民共和国，波兰及捷克政府，已先后与朝鲜人民民主共和国政府建立外交关系。
    又讯：日境朝鲜侨民同盟于十七日在东京举行群众大会，庆祝朝鲜人民民主共和国的成立，参加者达四千人。大会选出了一百二十名代表，准备回国参加金日成总理召集的一个会议。
