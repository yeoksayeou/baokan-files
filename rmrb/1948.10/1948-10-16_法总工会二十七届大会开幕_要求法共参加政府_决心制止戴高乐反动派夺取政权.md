　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Paris dispatch: The 27th Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) opened in Paris on the 11th, attended by 2,500 representatives from across the country. CGT General Secretary Frachon delivered a speech to the congress, pointing out that the French working people demand the French Communist Party, the most powerful party in France, to participate in the government. Frachon sharply criticized De Gaulle's fascism, declaring: The powerful French trade union movement, numbering in the millions, will surely stop all conspiracies by fascists to seize power. Frachon also stated: The French working class opposes France's participation in the Western European aggressive bloc, pointing out that the French reactionary government's participation in this bloc has cost France 450 billion francs this year. Frachon concluded: The CGT will fight to balance prices and wages, to guarantee a minimum wage of 15,000 francs per month, and to oppose the Marshall Plan of enslavement. Concurrent with the opening of the congress, the spreading railway strike has further paralyzed the French transportation system, especially in the east, southeast, and west. Railway workers in Amiens, Lille, and other northern cities have voted to join the strike. The indefinite strike of 350,000 miners in northern France entered its second week on the 11th. The miners' union issued a statement on the 10th stating: "The strike will continue until victory is achieved."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Labor Daily published a special article on the 10th, commenting on the 27th Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor, stating: This congress, held from October 11th to 16th, will be a major event in the life of the French working class. The CGT's strength and great prestige among the masses are a direct result of the unwavering policy of defending the interests of the working people consistently adhered to by this most powerful and representative trade union organization in France. The constantly growing efforts of workers to strive for unity of action are a prominent feature of the recent stage of the French strike struggle. In most cases, trade unionists belonging to the Christian League and "Workers' Force" have joined the CGT workers in the strike, regardless of the open prohibitions of their leaders. In recent months, joint trade union committees have been formed in thousands of enterprises, including representatives from the CGT, the Christian Workers' League, and "Workers' Force." Since August, unified action has begun to be implemented on an entire industrial area scale, followed by implementation on a provincial scale. Under mass pressure, the leading bodies of the "Workers' Force" and Christian trade union local committees were forced to conclude agreements with the CGT for unified action. The main slogans of the 27th Congress of the CGT are to strengthen worker solidarity, satisfy worker demands, and form a truly democratic government trusted by the people and serving the interests of the people. The CGT unites millions of workers regardless of political or religious beliefs, with Communists, Socialists, non-partisans, Catholics, and those with no religious beliefs fighting shoulder to shoulder in its ranks. In the course of a powerful solidarity movement sweeping the country, the split created by the reactionaries last December with money supplied by the US State Department and the AFL has virtually vanished. The restoration of unity is the greatest achievement of the French working people. The 27th Congress of the CGT will unite all forces to further consolidate the solidarity of the working people, to strive for the satisfaction of the legitimate demands of the working class, and to fight for a democratic and independent France for all working people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS Paris dispatch, 11th: Leaders of the French Socialist Party are currently holding preparatory meetings in Paris for the party's upcoming national conference. Léon Blum, representing the minority faction of the previous congress, proposed a motion requesting that this national conference should have the powers of an extraordinary congress. Representatives who recently announced their departure from the Socialist Party's National Assembly group due to their opposition to the party's reactionary leadership immediately supported the motion and jointly issued a declaration condemning the Socialist Party leaders for "completely emasculating the doctrine of socialism" and "having no trace of the party's basic principles in their actions." The declaration demanded that the Socialist Party ministers resign and refuse to participate in this tripartite government that is not supported by the working class. Although these suggestions were rejected by the majority faction within the party, Party Secretary-General Mollet was forced to admit in his speech that "there is a tendency in many branches of the Socialist Party to favor the participation of the Communist Party in the government."

　　法总工会二十七届大会开幕
  　要求法共参加政府
  　决心制止戴高乐反动派夺取政权
    【新华社陕北十四日电】巴黎讯：法国总工会第二十七届大会十一日在巴黎开幕，到全国各地代表二千五百人。总工会总书记佛拉商向大会发表演说，指出法国劳动人民要求法国最强大的政党——共产党参加政府。佛拉商尖锐抨击戴高乐法西斯主义，宣称：为数达数百万人的强大的法国职工运动，必将制止法西斯主义夺取政权的一切阴谋。佛拉商又称：法国工人阶级反对法国参加西欧侵略集团，指出法国反动政府的参加这个集团，已使法国今年花费了四千五百亿法郎。佛拉商最后称：总工会将为平衡物价与工资，为保证最低工资每月一万五千法郎，为反对马歇尔奴役计划而斗争。与大会开幕同时，蔓延着的铁路罢工已更进一步地瘫痪了法国运输系统，在东部、东南部与西部更是如此。亚眠、里尔及其他北方城市的铁路工人已表决参加罢工。法国北部三十五万矿工之无定期罢工至十一日已进入第二周，矿工工会十日发表声明称：“罢工将继续到获得胜利为止”。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报十日发表专文，评论法国总工会二十七届大会称：自十月十一日至十六日举行的这一大会，将是法国劳动阶级生活中的重大事件。总工会在群众中的力量和巨大威信，乃是法国这一最强有力的和有代表性的工会组织始终不渝坚持保卫劳动人民利益的政策的直接结果。工人争取行动团结之不断增长的努力，是最近阶段法国罢工斗争的显著特征。在大多数场合，属于基督教联盟和“工人力量”的职工都不顾其领袖们的公开禁令，而和总工会的工人一起参加罢工。近数月来，在数千企业中已组成联合工会委员会，包括总工会、基督教工人联盟和“工人力量”的代表。自八月起，统一行动已开始按整个工业区范围实行，继之并按省的范围实行。在群众压力下，“工人力量”和基督教工会地方委员会的领导机构被迫缔结与总工会统一行动协定。总工会二十七届大会的主要口号是加强工人团结，满足工人要求和组成受人民信任并为人民谋利益的真正的民主政府。总工会团结了数百万不分政治和宗教信仰的工人，在其行列中并肩斗争的有共产党人、社会党人、无党无派者、天主教徒和无宗教信仰者。在遍布全国的强有力的团结运动过程中，反动派于去年十二月用美国务院和劳联供给的钱而制造的分裂，实际上已化为乌有。团结的恢复是法国劳动人民最伟大的成就。总工会二十七届大会将团聚各种力量，为进一步巩固劳动人民的团结、为满足劳动阶级的合法要求、为全体劳动人民争取民主独立的法兰西而奋斗。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社巴黎十一日讯：法国社会党领袖刻正在巴黎为该党即将召开之全国会议举行预备会议。莱翁·布边代表上届大会之少数派提出动议，要求本届全国会议应具有非常大会的权力。因反对该党反动领导而于最近宣布离开该党国民议会党团之各代表立即予以支持，并共同发表宣言，谴责社会党领袖“完全阉割了社会主义的学说”，而且“在他们的行动中，没有党的基本原则的任何痕迹”。宣言要求社会党部长们辞职，并拒绝参加这个不为工人阶级所支持的三党政府。这些建议虽然被党内多数派否决了。但该党总书记摩勒在其演说中也不得不承认“在社会党许多支部中有赞成使共产党参加政府的倾向”。
