[Taiyue Telegram] The Jin Miaoer Women's Mutual Aid Group in Henan Village, Third District of Tunliu, overcame labor difficulties and carried out the autumn harvest and planting in a planned and step-by-step manner. The group has a total of five families, four of which are military dependents. The five families together have 345 mu of autumn land, two weak livestock, and four men who cannot work regularly. Jin Miaoer's family has neither livestock nor men, and she cultivates 35 mu of land alone. Because of labor difficulties, Jin Miaoer and the other four families voluntarily organized themselves for mutual aid production. Everyone elected Jin Miaoer and Wang Sannv as the group leader and deputy group leader respectively. Since the organization, they have not neglected any tasks such as hoeing corn, planting millet, cutting wheat, and weeding seedlings, and they have done a good job. The millet fields have been weeded three times. During wheat planting, although livestock power was scarce, the group's 62 mu of wheat land was plowed twice, and 37 mu of the wheat land was plowed twice by their seven people. They also applied a lot of fertilizer. They cut artemisia and composted more than 80 cartloads of manure, totaling more than 120 dan. In addition to 15 or 16 dan of corral manure per mu, they also applied dry manure. Sowing began the day before White Dew and was completed on the 13th of this month. The 62 mu of wheat were completely planted in seven days. The reasons for their success in mutual aid production are mainly good planning and organization. First, they formulate plans through democratic discussion, and they plan the next stage of work while doing the current stage, such as planning the weeding while cutting wheat, and planning the autumn harvest while planting wheat. Second, they developed various forms of labor exchange, which can complement each other's strengths and make up for each other's deficiencies. When plowing the land, they established methods of exchanging labor between people and animals, and exchanging farming and spinning. When planting, the 37 mu of wheat from Jin Miaoer and the other three families were all planted by people pulling seed drills. They also applied a lot of fertilizer. They cut artemisia and composted more than 80 cartloads of manure, totaling more than 120 dan. In addition to 15 or 16 dan of corral manure per mu, they also applied dry manure. Sowing began the day before White Dew and was completed on the 13th of this month. The 62 mu of wheat were completely planted in seven days.

　　河南村军属互助生产
    克服困难完成收种
    【太岳电】屯留三区河南村靳苗儿妇女互助组，克服劳力困难，有计划按步骤的进行了三秋。全组共五家，其中有四家是军属，五家共秋地三百四十五亩，有两头瘦弱的牲口，四个不能经常劳动的男人，靳苗儿家既没牲口，又没男人，一个人种地三十五亩。因为劳力困难，靳苗儿等五家自动组织起来互助生产。大家推选靳苗儿、王三女为正副组长。自组织后，她们锄玉茭、种谷、割麦、锄苗等样样不误，还搞得不错，谷地都锄过三遍。在种麦时，虽然畜力困难，全组六十二亩麦地也做到犁两遍，其中有三十七亩麦地有二遍是她们七个人刨的。种的时候，靳苗儿等三家三十七亩麦子全用人拉耧来种。上粪也不少。她们割蒿沤了八十多车粪，合一百二十多担，每亩地除上十五六担圈粪外，还上了干粪。从白露前一日开始下种，到本月十三日为止，七天工夫六十二亩麦子完全种好。她们互助生产搞好的原因，主要是计划性和组织性好，第一、民主讨论订出计划，做这一段活时就订好下一段计划，如割麦时就订锄苗计划，种麦时就订秋收计划。第二、发展各种变工，能够长短相补，有无相济。犁地时，她们订有人畜变工、耕纺变工的办法。
