Xinhua News Agency, Suiyuan Front, 8th: In Suiyuan, Fu Zuoyi's old base, where he desperately calls himself a "reformer," do the people choose Fu Zuoyi or the People's Liberation Army? The facts in the Suiyuan war answer this question. Two days before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, a village in Suiyuan had already prepared grain, stretchers, and housing. When the People's Liberation Army arrived, the villagers crowded the streets to welcome them, and many people brought teapots and bowls for the soldiers to drink water. Everyone complained, "These days, we heard that Fu Zuoyi was coming to rob our crops, and we were worried day and night, hoping you would come soon. Now you have really come." An old peasant woman, Ma Debao's wife, was busy sweating, mixing elm bark with white mud to whitewash the house. She said kindly to the soldiers, "Whitewash the walls so that the bedbugs won't bite, and you can have a good sleep and be energetic when you fight." This village had been robbed by Fu Zuoyi's army seven times. Of course, they know Fu Zuoyi's true face much better than the foreign reporters in Peiping. In the vast newly recovered areas of southern Suiyuan, even near the suburbs of Guihua, a democratic order has been rapidly established. The democratic government's proclamations of reassurance to the people are posted everywhere. The newly liberated villages have automatically organized guides and stretchers, enthusiastically supporting the front lines. Many puppet Baojia personnel have registered with the democratic government to turn over a new leaf. During the Sui-Bao Campaign in 1945, Fu Zuoyi deceived and coerced the local people into implementing the so-called "empty houses and clearing the fields," causing great losses to the people. This time, before Fu Zuoyi's army retreated, they spread rumors: "The Eighth Route Army will definitely kill for three days wherever they go." They also threatened them with "those who do not retreat with the Kuomintang army will be killed." But all these tricks did not work this time. The discipline and policies of the People's Liberation Army are much better than Fu Zuoyi's. The people have decided to choose the People's Liberation Army and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to overthrow this last major warlord in North China.

### 傅作义的欺骗把戏不灵了　绥蒙人民热烈迎我军

　　傅作义的欺骗把戏不灵了
    绥蒙人民热烈迎我军
    【新华社绥蒙前线八日电】在竭力自称为“改革者”的傅作义的老根据地绥远，人民究竟是选择傅作义还是解放军呢？绥远战争中的事实答复了这个问题。绥远的一个村庄在解放军到达前两天，就把粮草、担架、住房等准备好了。当解放军到达时，村民拥在街道两旁欢迎，许多人提着茶壶端着碗让战士喝水。大家都诉说：“这几天听说傅作义要来抢庄稼，咱们白日黑夜愁不过，早盼你们快来哪，现在真来了。”一个农民马德保的老婆忙得满头大汗，用榆皮搅白泥刷房，她向战士亲切地说：“把墙刷好臭虫不咬，你们睡个好觉，打起仗来才有劲。”这个村庄被傅作义的军队抢劫过七次，他们对于傅作义的真面目当然比北平的中外记者们认识得多些。绥远南部广大新收复区直至归绥近郊，民主秩序已迅速建立。到处贴着民主政府的安民布告。新解放村庄都自动组织向导、担架，热烈支援前线。许多伪保甲人员已纷纷向民主政府登记自新。一九四五年绥包战役时，傅作义曾欺骗和胁迫当地人民实行所谓“空舍清野”，人民受了很大的损失。这次傅作义的军队撤退前又大肆造谣：“八路军每到一地，一定大杀三天。”并且用“不随国军撤退者杀”来威胁他们。但是这一切把戏在这次都不灵了，解放军的纪律和政策比傅作义好得太多了，人民决定选择解放军，与解放军合作打倒这个华北最后的大军阀。
