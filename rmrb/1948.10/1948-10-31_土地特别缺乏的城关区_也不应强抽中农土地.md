　　Land is Particularly Scarce in Chengguan District
  　Also, the Land of Middle Peasants Should Not Be Forcibly Drawn

    Question: 1. In individual Chengguan districts, land is particularly scarce, and land simply cannot solve livelihood problems. However, some people here have land, which is enough for their family's consumption for a year. In the case of general land shortage, his land exceeds the average by one time or one-third. Should he be asked to give land to others? If he gives it to others, he has no other occupation to maintain his livelihood, and life will decline or be embarrassing; otherwise, his land is one time more than others. What should be done in such a situation?
    2. Regarding the timing of calculating class components, according to the documents, it should be traced back three to five years from the establishment of the democratic regime. In our area, democratic regimes were established in vast rural areas shortly after the July 7th Incident. However, some cities were ruled by the Kuomintang again after the Japanese surrender and were only liberated last year or this year. From when should the calculation of class components in these places be traced back?

    Answer: (1) Peasants in individual Chengguan districts where land is particularly scarce, if they are self-cultivating and self-sufficient and have no feudal exploitation, are of ordinary middle peasant composition. Although his land is one time more than the local land average, unless he himself volunteers, his land should not be drawn out and distributed to others, because the purpose of land reform is to eliminate feudalism, only confiscating and requisitioning the land and feudal property of landlords and rich peasants. If the land of middle peasants is forcibly taken out for equal distribution, it will be a mistake of infringing on middle peasants and absolute equalitarianism. In Chengguan districts with such a shortage of land, the citizens do not rely solely on agricultural life in fact, and they can be helped to seek development in industry and commerce.
    (2) According to the CCP Central Committee's 1933 document, the time standard for calculating landlord composition is based on the time of establishment of the democratic regime as the starting point, tracing upwards, and those who have continuously lived a landlord life for three full years constitute a landlord composition. Your saying "three to five years" is incorrect. The areas where democratic regimes were established after the July 7th Incident were occupied by the enemy until the Japanese surrender, with a gap of seven or eight years in between. The composition of the people has changed under the influence of the democratic regime. From when they were occupied by the enemy until they were liberated last year or this year, only two or three years have passed. Generally speaking, the changes are not too great. Therefore, the starting point for calculation should be the time when the first democratic regime was established. If there are changes now, the current composition can be determined according to the specific situation.

### 土地特别缺乏的城关区　也不应强抽中农土地

　　土地特别缺乏的城关区
  　也不应强抽中农土地
    问：一、在个别的城关区，土地特别少，土地根本不能解决生活问题，但这里也有一些人有土地，并且够他本家一年的消耗。在一般缺地的情形下，他的土地是超过平均数的一倍或三分之一。应否叫他拿出土地给别人呢？如果给了别人，他又没别的职业去维持生活，生活会下降或难堪；不然他的土地又比别人多一倍。象这样的情形该怎么办？
    二、计算成份的时间问题，按文件上说，自民主政权建立起向上推三年至五年，自己劳动的，成份应划为农民。咱们区域大部是七七事变后不久即在广大农村建立起民主政权，可是有的城市到日本投降后又被国民党统治，至去年或今年才被解放的。这些地方的计算成份应从何时开始向上推算？

    答：（一）个别土地特别缺乏的城关区的农民，如是自耕自食，没有封建剥削，是普通中农成份。他的土地虽然比当地土地平均数多一倍，除非他自己自愿，其土地不应抽出分给别人，因为土地改革的目的是消灭封建，只没收和征收地主富农的土地和封建财产，如把中农的土地勉强拿出来平均分配，就犯了侵犯中农及绝对平均主义的错误。象这样土地特别缺少的城关区，市民们事实上不是专靠农业生活，可以帮助他们从工商业方面求发展。
    （二）按中共中央一九三三年文件，计算地主成份的时间标准是以从民主政权建立时间为起点，向上推算，连续过地主生活满三年者，即构成地主成份。你说“三年至五年”是不对的，七七事变后即建立了民主政权地区，到日本投降被敌侵占，中间相隔了七八年的时间，人们的成份，在民主政权影响下已起变化。被敌侵占后至去年或今年解放只二三年的时间，就一般情形说，变化不至太大。所以应从第一次民主政权建立时为计算的起点，现在如有了变化，可按具体情形订现在的成份。
