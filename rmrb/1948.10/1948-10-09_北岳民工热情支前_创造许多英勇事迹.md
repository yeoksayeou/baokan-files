(Northern Yueh Electric) The civilian laborers in the Northern Yueh region have demonstrated unparalleled enthusiasm in their support for the front in various campaigns, creating many admirable and heroic deeds. During the Chahar-Suiyuan and Northern Shanxi campaigns this spring, Chen Zhong'er from Laogu Village, Third District of Tang County, observed discipline during marches, constantly encouraged everyone's morale, and helped others carry their belongings. He gave his room to others, sleeping in the yard overnight. He also frequently helped the cooks with cooking, fetching water, and boiling water. After arriving at the front line and receiving his assignment, he immediately challenged others to a competition: During his first time on the front line rescuing the wounded, everyone else had retreated, but he braved the hail of bullets, crossing machine gun positions to rescue people. When transporting the wounded to the rear, he used his own cotton-padded coat as a pillow for the wounded and covered them with his leather jacket. While digging communication trenches and trenches in Xijiabao, he brought door panels with him and carried stretchers on the way back. After completing the task, the entire company unanimously praised him as a model for the entire company, and he was awarded a double major merit at the commendation meeting. Comrade Hu Shuan'yu from Yuantong Village, Fourth District of Lingshou, a middle peasant, originally served as the village security officer. He was mistakenly treated as a "stone" and removed during the land reform, and some ill-gotten gains were seized. However, he did not become pessimistic or disheartened, and he remained consistently proactive and responsible. He cared deeply for his team members and led others by his own exemplary actions. When crossing the Sanggan River, twelve out of the thirteen members of his team fell into the water. After getting out of the water, their clothes were frozen, and their hands were pierced by ice shards, rendering most of them unable to walk. At this time, Comrade Hu Shuan'yu actively comforted and encouraged everyone, proposing, "Be bold but careful, pay attention to everything, we will not return until we complete the mission," and he also helped everyone carry their things. At the front, he often explained military knowledge to the team members, alleviating their fear; throughout the entire campaign, none of the people he led deserted or were injured. He took meticulous care of the wounded; during the Ying County campaign, while rescuing the wounded, because it was too close to the enemy, it was inconvenient to carry them, so Shuan'yu Comrade used a door panel, crawled down, put the door panel on his back, and crawled along with the wounded on his back, finally passing through the twenty-meter enemy fire blockade line and transporting the wounded back to the rear. Comrade Qi Zhengtang from Bei Hongcheng Village, Third District of Tang County, served as the platoon leader of the first platoon of the third company. Before the expedition, he conducted a challenge at the team members' meeting and signed contracts on the spot. From the beginning of the expedition, he never relaxed the education of the team members, he encouraged everyone and said, "We have never been to Northern Yan, let's open our eyes this time!" When attacking Ying County, he led a stretcher team to the forefront to rescue the wounded while ill; the stretcher team he commanded was not chaotic at all, but very organized and planned. In the Chahar-Suiyuan and Northern Shanxi campaigns, a total of ninety-nine meritorious people emerged, eighteen of whom were awarded major merits. These meritorious individuals played a significant guaranteeing role in the campaigns.

　　北岳民工热情支前  创造许多英勇事迹
    【北岳电】北岳全区民工，在历次支前中，表现了无比的热情，创造了许多可歌可泣的英勇事迹。今春察绥、晋北战役，唐县三区老姑村陈忠尔，在行军中遵守纪律，随时鼓动大家情绪，并帮助别人背东西。把别人让到屋里，他在院子里睡了一夜。并经常帮助伙夫作饭、打水、烧水。到了前线接受任务之后，立即和别人挑战竞赛：第一次上火线抢救伤员，别人都下了火线，他还冒着枪林弹雨，越过机枪阵地来抢救。向后方转运伤员时，他把自己的袄给伤员枕上，皮袄给伤员盖上。在西家堡挖交通沟和战壕时，去时捎着门扇，回来就抬担架。任务完成后，全连一致评他为全连模范，评功会上他立了双大功。灵寿四区院同村胡拴玉同志，中农成份，原任村治安员，土改中被错当成“石头”搬掉，并被清算一些浮财，但他情绪毫不悲观低落，一贯积极负责。他很爱护队员，并拿自己的模范作用带动别人。过桑干河时，全班十三个人，十二个人落水，出水后衣服都凝冻了，手也被冰片扎破，大部都不能走了。这时胡拴玉同志积极安慰鼓励大家，提出“胆大心细，各处注意，完不成任务我们不回去”，又替大家拿东西。在前方，他经常给队员讲解军事常识，免除队员害怕心理；在整个战役中，他带的人没有一个逃亡，没有一个伤亡。他对伤员照顾无微不至；在应县战役中抢救伤员，因为距敌太近，不便抬又不能背，拴玉同志用一个门扇，自己爬下，把门扇放在背上，驮着伤员爬着走，终于通过了二十米敌火力封锁线，将伤员运回后方。唐县三区北洪城村齐正堂同志，任三连一排长，出征前即在队员大会上进行了挑战，当场立了双方合同。从出征开始，他从不放松队员的教育，他鼓励大家说：“咱们没到过雁北，这次可开开眼吧！”攻应县时，他带着病，亲自带一付担架到最前边抢救伤员，他所指挥的担架一点也不乱，非常有组织有计划。在察绥、晋北一次战役里，总计涌现功臣九十九名，记大功者十八名。这些功臣们在战役中均起了相当的保证作用。
