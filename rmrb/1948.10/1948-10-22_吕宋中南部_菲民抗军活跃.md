Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 18th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Manila: The People's Anti-Japanese Army in the central and southern provinces of Luzon continues its guerrilla warfare. On the evening of the 2nd, in an ambush on the highway outside Angeles City in Pampanga Province, the People's Anti-Japanese Army killed seven enemy policemen and wounded five enemy soldiers. On the evening of the 10th, on a highway only seventeen kilometers away from Manila, the People's Anti-Japanese Army ambushed three enemy vehicles, killing and wounding four enemies, so that Philippine Labor Minister and other government officials only dared to pass the area half an hour later under the escort of fully armed garrison troops. The People's Anti-Japanese Army also attacked enemy garrison members in villages in Nueva Ecija Province. According to the Manila Times on the 9th, the 55th Squadron, which was famous for resisting Japan during the war, is active in Nueva Ecija Province. The People's Anti-Japanese Army also attacked enemy troops in Batangas Province and Quezon Province in southern Luzon. Fearing the activities of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, the reactionary Philippine government has launched an "anti-communist" movement in Manila and other provinces. A so-called committee to investigate non-Philippine activities has also appeared in the Philippine Congress. The Philippine police bureau has also taken the opportunity to arrest many overseas Chinese and democratic elements among Filipinos.

  　菲民抗军活跃
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据路透社马尼拉讯：菲民抗军在吕宋中部及南部各省继续游击战。二日晚民抗军在班邦加省安基利斯城外大路上的一次伏击中，毙敌警察七名、伤敌士兵五名。十日晚，民抗军在距马尼拉仅十七公里的公路上，向敌汽车三辆伏击，毙伤敌四名，使菲劳工部长等政府官员在半小时后，仅在全副武装的警备部队的护卫下，才敢经过该地。民抗军并在奴瓦伊西加省村庄袭击敌警备队员。据马尼拉时报九日载：在奴瓦伊西加省活动的民抗军中有战时抗日闻名的第五十五中队。民抗军并在吕宋南部八打雁省与奎松省袭击敌军。慑于民抗军的活跃，菲反动政府已在马尼拉及其他省份发动“反共”运动，菲国会中也出现所谓非菲活动调查委员会，菲警察局并借故逮捕华侨与菲律宾人中民主分子多名。
