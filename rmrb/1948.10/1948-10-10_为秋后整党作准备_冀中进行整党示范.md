　　Preparing for Autumn Party Rectification
    Jizhong Carries Out Party Rectification Demonstration
    [Jizhong Electric] In order to gain experience and lay the foundation for a comprehensive party rectification in the autumn, Jizhong sub-districts, counties, and cities carried out party rectification demonstrations in August, and gained some preliminary experience. According to statistics, a total of twenty-nine villages in twenty-four counties in the Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Sub-districts conducted party rectification demonstrations. Among them, six villages were directly managed by personnel dispatched by the local party committees, and the others were directly led by the county and city party committees. Most of them were completed by the end of August and the beginning of September. Each demonstration village in the Ninth Sub-district was equipped with a county committee member responsible for leadership. The head of the Eleventh District Committee and the Civil Law Section of the Commissioner's Office also participated directly. The Eighth Sub-district used less force.
    There were three situations in the demonstration villages: one was that the fruits of victory in the village had been distributed and the wrongly designated class status had been changed. The main content was to resolve the relationship between new and old cadres and the relationship between the party and the masses. Party rectification was carried out as soon as they intervened; the other was to divide the fruits and change the designated class status. In the latter type of village, depending on the situation, some rectified the party first, then distributed the fruits and changed the designated class status, and some distributed the fruits and changed the designated class status first, and then rectified the party. In addition, some villages were caught up in floods during the process, so they were suspended for a period of time, and continued when the flood receded. Some villages were caught up in the autumn harvest, so they could not be fully carried out. They only made small-scale adjustments to the organization and carried out a party criticism movement. This demonstration generally involved convening branch meetings, general membership meetings, reviewing past land reform and party rectification, explaining the future party rectification principles and purposes, and how branch members should work. The party rectification textbooks were interspersed to carry out brewing and understand the situation. Then, a mass meeting was convened (usually a farmers' association member meeting) to explain the relationship between party rectification and the masses, and the list of party members was announced in the farmers' association. Then, branch and general membership meetings were held to discuss party rectification methods. Then, peasant representatives were elected to help rectify the party. Opinions were raised at the party rectification meeting, criticism was launched, problems were dealt with, and new branch committees were elected.
    According to existing materials, there are the following points of experience in the demonstration process: (1) It is necessary to first understand the specific situation and combine it with the current work. For example, if the village urgently needs to adjust the village organization, divide the floating wealth, and correct the wrongly designated class status, then start by solving these problems, and from this understand the relationship between the party and the masses, the situation of the branch, the relationship between new and old cadres, etc., so that both inside and outside the party feel that party rectification should be carried out, and it can be carried out smoothly. If not, holding a meeting to rectify the party upon arriving in the village will inevitably make the masses take a lukewarm attitude, and party rectification will be difficult to carry out. (2) It is necessary to recognize that the current open or hidden disunity phenomenon in rural branches is a general problem, and even after preliminary organizational adjustments, it is not easy to fundamentally solve it all at once. Their different characteristics are: new cadres are generally timid and have few methods, but their work style is generally upright; some old cadres have some working methods, but they have dissatisfaction, and even seek revenge. Both new and old cadres are afraid of party rectification. New cadres are mainly affected by the "moving stones" and doubt the party rectification policy, fearing that they will "move" themselves; old cadres are saddened by being "moved" and fear being punished again, and fear that the masses will raise more opinions. Therefore, solving the problem of disunity between new and old cadres is one of the main problems in party rectification. According to the party rectification demonstration, there are the following methods to solve this problem: First of all, it is proposed that no matter whether they are new or old cadres, they must work hard and serve the masses, and party members must be loyal to the work of the party; after explaining this problem, so that party members use this to measure themselves, and then convene a larger meeting, call for learning from each other's strengths and compensating for weaknesses, commend achievements, criticize mistakes, improve understanding, deeply examine themselves, and seize the backbone to drive ordinary party members to carry out criticism and self-criticism. When carrying out criticism and making self-examinations, on the one hand, it is necessary to seriously examine their mistakes, and at the same time, they must be made aware of their achievements, so as not to form a simple picking of faults. Invite upright peasant representatives to help raise opinions and conduct criticism. If the masses cannot be mobilized, simply reviewing in the branch and then electing will not solve the problem after the election. For example, in Housi Village in Jiaohe, the newly elected branch secretary was threatened and ran away by the old cadres during the land reform (it should be thoroughly investigated how he was threatened and ran away. If it is indeed the old cadres who threatened and ran away, it must be stopped and appropriately punished. Education should also be strengthened for the newly elected branch secretary – Editor). (3) Repeatedly explain the Communist Party's brightness and integrity and its relationship with the interests of the peasants to elect upright peasant representatives to help rectify the party. At the same time, the peasants should discuss the conditions for representatives to participate in the party rectification meeting to guard against bad elements taking the opportunity to infiltrate and sabotage the party rectification. The peasant representatives of Donghe in Anguo and Nan Zhao Village in Luancheng discussed the specific conditions: First, the masses support them, they are selfless, and their work style is upright; second, they work hard; third, they actively implement various tasks. Then, a secret ballot election is conducted, and after the election, the masses are asked to make suggestions on the representatives, and the leaders review them. If bad elements infiltrate, another election can be held after deliberation by the masses. (4) Combine the handling of practical problems to carry out discipline education, and give appropriate treatment to those who violate policies, seriously sabotage work, and have serious ideological problems, in order to strictly enforce party discipline.

　　为秋后整党作准备
    冀中进行整党示范
    【冀中电】为了取得经验，打下秋后全面大整党的基础，冀中各分区县、市在八月份大部进行了整党示范，并获得一些初步经验。据统计，八、九、十一三个分区共有二十四个县二十九个村进行了整党示范，其中由各地委直接派人掌握进行的六个村，其他均由各县市委直接领导进行，八月底和九月初都已先后大部完成。九分区每一个示范村均配备一个县委委员负责领导。十一地委及专署民法科长均直接参加。八分区用的力量较小。
    示范村有三种情况：一种是村中胜利果实已分配，错订成份均已改订，主要内容为解决新老干部关系和党群关系，一插手即进行整党；一种是有分果实和改定成份的内容。在后一种村庄，根据不同情况，有的先整党后分果实、改订成份，有的先分果实改订成份，再整党。另有的村在进行中正赶上闹水，因此中止一段，水势缓和时又继续进行。有的村正赶上秋忙，实际上不能充分进行，就小范围的调整一下组织，进行一次党内的批评运动。这次示范，一般是召开支部会、党员大会、检讨过去的土改、整党，说明今后整党方针与目的，及支部党员应如何工作，从中穿插讲解整党课本，进行酝酿，了解情况。然后召开群众大会（一般是农会会员大会），说明整党对群众的关系，在农会中公布党员名单；再开支部及党员大会，讨论整党办法。接着就选举农民代表，帮助整党。在整党大会上提意见，展开批评，处理问题，选举新支委。
    根据现有材料，在示范过程中有如下的几点经验：（一）必须首先了解具体情况，和当前工作结合进行。如目前村中迫切需要调整村组织，分浮财，改正错订成份，就首先从解决这些问题入手，从中了解党群关系、支部情况、新老干部关系等问题，使党内外都觉着应该整党，自然就能顺利进行。如不这样，到村就开会整党，必然使群众抱冷淡态度，整党也很难进行。（二）必须认识农村支部现在公开或隐蔽的不团结现象是一般性的问题，即便经过初步调整组织，也不容易一下根本解决。他们表现的不同特点是：新干部一般胆怯，办法少，但作风一般正派；老干部有些工作办法，但有不满情绪，甚至有寻机报复者。不论新老干部均怕整党。新干部主要是受“搬石头”的影响，对整党方针怀疑，怕搬自己；老干部则因被“搬”而伤心，怕再受处分，怕群众再给提意见。因此解决新老干部不团结问题，乃是整党中的主要问题之一。根据整党示范，解决这个问题有以下几个办法：首先提出，不管新老干部谁也要好好工作，为群众办事，党员必须忠实于党的工作；讲明这个问题后，使党员以此来衡量自己，然后再召开较大的会议，号召取长补短，表扬功绩，批评错误，提高认识，深刻检讨自己，并抓取当中骨干带动一般党员，开展批评与自我批评。在开展批评与进行检讨时，一方面要认真检讨其错误，同时要使其认识自己的成绩，不要形成单纯的挑毛病。邀请正派农民代表帮助提意见，进行批评。如不能发动群众起来，单纯的在支部内检讨一番即选举，选后也解决不了问题。如交河后寺门村，土改时新选的支部书记就被老干部威胁跑了（应当彻查是如何威胁跑的，如确系老干部威胁跑的，必须加以制止与适当处分。对新选支书亦应加强教育——编者）。（三）选举正派农民代表帮助整党，必须反复讲解共产党的光明正大，对农民利益的关系，同时由农民讨论参加整党会议的代表条件，以警惕坏分子乘机混入破坏整党。安国东河、栾城南赵村农民代表都讨论了具体条件：第一，群众拥护，大公无私，作风正派；第二，劳动好；第三，执行各种工作积极。然后进行无记名投票选举，选举之后，并经过群众对代表提意见，领导上加以审查，如有坏分子混入，可经过群众酝酿后另行改选。（四）结合处理实际问题，进行纪律教育，对违犯政策，严重破坏工作，以及有严重思想问题的，给予适当的处理，以严肃党纪。
