　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: San Francisco dispatch: Wallace, the Progressive Party's presidential candidate, vehemently condemned the reactionary US policy towards China in a campaign speech in San Francisco on the 6th. Wallace began by stating: Certain US generals are brazenly admitting that the United States is supplying Chiang Kai-shek with airplanes and artillery to make China an offensive base in a war that US military personnel are eagerly planning. Wallace pointed out that Claire Chennault told the US Congress on March 10th this year that new-type bombers taking off from China are much closer to Soviet industrial areas than those taking off from the United States. Wallace stated: There is no place in the world where there is such a provocative threat against the United States as Chennault's report. The fact that we can allow such remarks to be made in our Congress without refutation, and even publish them widely in newspapers, explains why the United States is violating the will of good people and becoming a country hated in many parts of the world. When Wallace addressed 9,000 listeners, including many striking sailors, at the San Francisco City Hall on the 7th, he condemned the West Coast oil companies and shipping owners' attempts to use the Taft-Hartley Act to undermine labor unions as "despicable actions" and attacked the Truman administration for suppressing the CIO maritime workers and Harry Bridges' longshoremen's union. Wallace's campaign tour of California, which began last week, has ended.

　　华莱士在旧金山作竞选演说
  　斥美军阀对华政策
    【新华社陕北十一日电】旧金山讯：美国进步党总统候选人华莱士六日在旧金山作竞选演说时严辞斥责美国反动派的对华政策。华莱士首称：美国某些将军们肆无忌惮地承认美国正在供给蒋介石飞机大炮，俾使中国在美国军人正热心计划的战争中成为进攻基地。华莱士指出，陈纳德今年三月十日曾告诉美国国会：新式轰炸机自中国起飞远较自美国起飞更接近于苏联工业区。华莱士称：世界上没有一个地方有象陈纳德报告那样针对美国而发的挑衅性威胁。我们竟能允许在我们国会发表这种言论而不受驳斥，并且还在报纸上大肆刊载，这一事实说明了为什么美国正在违反良善人民的意志而成为一个被世界许多地方所憎恨的国家。华莱士七日在旧金山市政厅对包括许多罢工海员的九千听众演说时，谴责西岸石油公司与航业主企图利用塔夫脱——哈特莱法以破坏工会，是“卑鄙的行动”，并抨击杜鲁门政府压迫产联海员工人与布利治领导的码头工会。华莱士上周开始的加利福尼亚州的竞选旅行已告结束。
