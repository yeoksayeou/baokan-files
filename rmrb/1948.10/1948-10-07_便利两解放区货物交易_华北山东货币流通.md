　　Facilitating Commodity Trade Between the Two Liberated Areas
　　Currency Circulation Between North China and Shandong
　　[From Our Newspaper] In order to facilitate commodity trade between the North China and Shandong Liberated Areas, the North China People's Government, after consultation with the Shandong Provincial Government, has decided to fix the exchange rate between the currencies issued in the North China and Shandong regions for mutual use, and has stipulated the following measures:
　　1. Beginning on October 5th of this year, banknotes issued by the Ji'nan Bank and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank, and banknotes issued by the Beihai Bank, will be allowed to circulate mutually in the North China and Shandong regions.
　　2. The exchange rate between Ji'nan currency and Beihai currency is fixed at one to one, meaning that one yuan of Ji'nan currency is equivalent to one yuan of Beihai currency; the exchange rate between Beihai currency and Border Region currency is fixed at one to ten, meaning that one yuan of Beihai currency is equivalent to ten yuan of Border Region currency, and will not be changed thereafter. All tax payments, transactions, and public and private financial dealings in both regions shall be circulated and paid according to this exchange rate, and no one shall change it.
　　3. Regardless of whether military personnel or civilians, anyone who privately sets exchange rates, engages in speculation, or attempts to disrupt the financial order or monopolize goods will be severely punished upon discovery.
