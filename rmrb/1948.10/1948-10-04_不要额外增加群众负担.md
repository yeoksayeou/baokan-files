Criticism and Suggestions

　　Do Not Add Extra Burdens on the Masses
　　Ciyu is one of the three major market towns in Lingshou, and also a transportation hub. Staff members often come and go, many without luggage, and after lodging, they ask the village for quilts to cover themselves. Later, because the masses were annoyed and unable to provide them, the method of renting quilts was adopted since the 35th year of the Republic of China. According to statistics from the North Street of Ciyu (200 households), a total of 1,763 quilts were rented out from the eighth month of the lunar calendar last year to the end of July this year. From the beginning of July to the end of August last year, the rental price for each quilt was 50 yuan. From the beginning of September to the end of May this year, it was 100 yuan, and from June to July it was 150 yuan. In eleven months, households without quilts paid a total rental price of more than 187,000 yuan. Before September last year, quilts were provided by households with a unified progressive tax of five points or more, based on the number of doors. After September of the same year, it was changed to a unified provision of quilts based on the number of doors. Households without quilts were dissatisfied with paying money, and households with quilts also felt it was too troublesome to constantly provide quilts. We propose the following suggestions: external staff members, soldiers, and passers-by who lodge overnight should bring their own quilts to reduce trouble for the masses. At the same time, we suggest that district and village cadres consider the interests of the masses, change the method of renting quilts, and remove the extra burden on the masses.
　　In addition, the village provides a lot of meals. Last year, a total of 5,870 meals were provided, an average of 489 meals per month, and an average of 16 meals per day. The village cadre on duty each day was dedicated to providing meals. There were also passers-by who ate meals without paying for the vegetables, or complained that the "rice was bad" and asked the villagers to make it again. This kind of behavior that is divorced from the masses should be corrected. They should think about the masses!

### 不要额外增加群众负担

　　不要额外增加群众负担
    慈峪是灵寿三大集镇之一，又是四通八达的交通要道。工作人员经常来往，不带行李的很多，住宿后便向村中要被子盖。后因群众讨厌，派不出来，自民国三十五年改用赁被子办法。据慈峪北街（二百户）统计，从去年阴历八月初至今年七月底，共派被子一七六三条。去年七月初至八月底每条被子赁价是五十元，九月初至今年五月底是一百元，六月至七月是一百五十元，十一个月内，没被子户共出赁价十八万七千余元。去年九月以前，是按统累税五分以上户，按门出被子。同年九月以后，即改为统一按门出被子。没被子户出赁价，由村干代赁。没被子户不满出钱，有被子户也感到经常要被子太麻烦。特提出建议：外宿工作人员、军人、行路外宿者带上被子，减少群众麻烦。同时建议区、村干部为群众打算，改变赁被子办法，去掉群众额外负担。
    另外该村派饭也很多，去年一年统计，共派饭五千八百七十顿，每月平均四百八十九顿，每天平均十六顿，每天值日村干部专作了派饭工作。还有过路人员吃了饭不给菜金，或嫌“饭坏”，叫老乡重作。这种脱离群众作风应该纠正，替群众设想一下才好！
