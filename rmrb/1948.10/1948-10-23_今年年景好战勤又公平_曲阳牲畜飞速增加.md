　　Good Harvest Year, Fair War Service
　　Rapid Increase in Livestock in Qu Yang
　　[North Yue News] Qu Yang has thoroughly implemented the policy of rewarding the development of production, and the county has increased its livestock by 6,663 head. In the past, due to years of poor harvests (especially last year), lack of forage, and unfair war service burdens, some areas increased the burden on middle peasants and livestock, etc., resulting in a significant reduction in livestock. For example, in Wende Village, Area 1, 199 households had only 33 head of livestock, and in Xiaonanguan, 130 households had only 4 donkeys. In Wanghuazhuang, Area 4, there was an average of only one head of livestock per 100 mu of land. According to statistics in March, the county only had 13,463 head of livestock (including 12,200 donkeys). Therefore, it became more difficult for farmers to cultivate. In order to increase livestock and develop agricultural production, county and district leaders, in response to this situation, fully utilized peasant newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, discussion meetings, individual propaganda, and other forms to widely and deeply publicize the democratic government's policies of rewarding and assisting production and tax policies, issued agricultural loans, and organized the masses to purchase livestock. Each district also convened district or sub-district peasant representative meetings to discuss ways to expand the scope of human and animal labor burdens, and decided that cadres' human and animal labor would be uniformly burdened. In May and June of this year, the county initially carried out war service rectification, and the burden on people and livestock gradually became fair and reasonable. Some villages and transportation stations implemented the system of evaluating work, collective work, and bookkeeping (some villages did not do well enough). As a result, the number of livestock in the county increased rapidly. According to a survey and statistics in mid-September, the number of livestock in the county increased from 13,463 to 20,096. The actual increase was 6,633 head, which is equivalent to one-half of the previous total number of livestock. In the fifteen villages of Beishuiyu Zhibang in Area 5 alone, the number of livestock increased by 100 head in August and September.
　　There are four specific reasons for the increase in livestock: (1) After the peasants turned themselves over, their enthusiasm for production increased, and after receiving floating property, they bought a large number of livestock. Zhang Luoyao's family of six previously had only three mu of land. After the land reform, they had 23 mu of land, and this autumn they bought a donkey with Zhang San. He happily said, "A farmer who raises a livestock is worth half a fortune." (2) The government issued agricultural loans, and 191 head of livestock were organized for the masses to purchase (incomplete statistics). (3) After the initial rectification of war service, the scope of the burden was expanded, and the burden on the masses became fair and reasonable. In Dongdi Village, Area 4, because the burden surface was too small and the burden was unreasonable, there were 163 head of livestock in the village, only 103 head were tilling for others, and the 50 head of livestock of military, cadre, and martyr families and the 10 head of livestock of village cadres were not tilling for others. The masses were very dissatisfied, and many sold their livestock. Later, a meeting of the masses, cadres, and military, cadre, and martyr families was held, and opinions were solicited to re-stipulate the method of tilling for others, and the unfair burden was corrected. Two military families who sold their livestock bought livestock again, and the village has increased its livestock by 80 head. (4) Because the harvest this year is better, the farmers have forage, and coupled with the widespread publicity on the exemption point for livestock in this year's new agricultural tax, the masses feel that raising livestock is profitable, and many people are buying livestock.

　　今年年景好战勤又公平
  　曲阳牲畜飞速增加
    【北岳讯】曲阳贯彻执行了奖励发展生产政策，全县增加牲畜六千六百六十三头。在以前，由于连年歉收（特别是去年），草料缺乏，加之战勤负担不够公平，有些地区加重中农人畜负担等等原因，致使牲口大大减少。如一区文德村一百九十九户，仅有牲口卅三头，小南关一百卅户，只有四头毛驴。四区王化庄每百亩地才平均一头牲口。据三月份统计，全县只有牲口一万三千四百六十三头（内有驴一万二千二百头）。因此，农民耕种增加不少困难。为了增加牲畜，发展农业生产，县区领导上，便针对这种情况，充分利用农民报，屋顶广播，黑板报，座谈会，个别宣传等形式，广泛深入宣传了民主政府奖励与扶助生产的政策及税收政策，发放了农贷，组织群众购买牲畜。各区并曾召开过区或小区农民代表会，讨论扩大人、畜负担面的办法，并决定一般干部人、畜一律负勤。在今年五、六月间，全县初步进行了战勤整理，人畜负担逐渐走向公平合理，部分村庄与交通站，实行了评工、齐工、记帐制度（有的村作的尚不太好）。由此，全县牲畜飞速增加。据九月中旬的调查统计，全县牲口由一万三千四百六十三头，增至二万零九十六头。实增六千六百三十三头，相当以前牲口总数的二分之一。仅五区北水峪纸坊等十五村，在八、九两月内即增加牲口一百头。
    牲口增加的具体原因有四：（一）农民翻身后，生产情绪提高，分到浮财后，大量买牲口。张洛尧六口人，以前只三亩地，土改后有了二十三亩地，今秋和张三伙买了一头驴。欢喜的说：“庄稼主喂头牲口，顶半块家业。”（二）政府发放农贷，组织群众购买的牲口有一百九十一头（不完全的统计）。（三）战勤初步整理后，扩大了负担面，群众负担达到公平合理。四区东邸村，因负担面太小，负担不合理，全村牲口一百六十三头，代耕的只一百零三头，军、干、烈属的五十头牲口和村干部的十头牲口均不代耕。群众甚为不满，卖掉牲口不少。后来召开了群众、干部及军干烈属会议，征求了意见，重新规定代耕办法，纠正了负担不公，两户卖掉牲口的军属，又买上了牲口，总计全村已增加了牲口八十头。（四）由于今年年景较好，农民有了草料，再加上对今年新农业税牲口除免征点的普遍宣传，群众感到喂牲口有利，买牲口的不少。　　（莱夫、凤仪、岭峻）
