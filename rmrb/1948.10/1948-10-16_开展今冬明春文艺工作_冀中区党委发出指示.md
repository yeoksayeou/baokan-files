　　Carrying out Literary and Artistic Work This Winter and Next Spring
  　Jizhong District Party Committee Issues Instructions
    ★The Jizhong District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on carrying out literary and artistic work this winter and next spring, pointing out that rural literary and artistic activities need to be widely developed during this winter's Party rectification and next spring's democratic movement. Party committees at all levels must seize this opportunity to organize professional literary and artistic workers, amateur village, school, and factory troupes, as well as the vast number of old artists and folk artists, to participate in literary and artistic activities. The instructions pointed out: (1) The propaganda departments of the prefectural, county, and municipal Party committees should add literary and artistic affairs officers. If there are no suitable candidates and it is difficult to supplement them for the time being, a dedicated person must be assigned to be responsible for literary and artistic work. (2) Each county can, based on the foundation of local literary and artistic work and the current specific situation, initiate the establishment of township art joint associations of a professional guild nature, including new and old artists, to promote township art and help the development of new art and the transformation of old art. The county Party committee propaganda department should regard the township art joint association as an important propaganda department and strengthen its leadership. (3) Local professional theater troupes should, this winter and next spring, combine with the central tasks and go deep into the countryside for extensive performances most of the time. All agencies, schools, and factories can establish amateur theater troupes, singing teams, drum groups, and other literary and artistic organizations under possible conditions, and can publicize to the masses when necessary and possible. (4) Counties in central areas should combine with the current central work and focus on restoring village theater troupes. The county and municipal Party committee propaganda departments should directly help the establishment of certain central village theater troupes. The performance form of village theater troupes should be simple, strictly avoid extravagance, and meet the requirements of the masses. Necessary expenses should be solved from production, and war support can be independently organized to facilitate both. (5) Transform old dramas and develop big drum (shuochang performance). Old opera programs that have not been officially printed and distributed after being announced or revised by the North China Literary Association or the Propaganda Department of the Jizhong District Party Committee are not allowed to be performed indiscriminately. Leadership should be strengthened for big drum artists, and they should be helped to create. The apprenticeship system cannot be interfered with under the voluntary agreement of both parties, but it is necessary to help improve their past feudal and unreasonable apprenticeship relationship. (6) The creation of new opera scripts and new singing scripts is the main key to whether this literary and artistic work can be carried out well. The propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels must systematically promote and organize all cadres, teachers, and folk artists who can write to work hard on new creations, and provide them with assistance and guidance in all aspects. The competent departments should formulate specific creation plans and requirements for those who specialize in creation and complete them on schedule. In order to improve and encourage creation, the Jizhong Administrative Office has allocated 10 million yuan as literary and artistic bonuses, and the Administrative Office’s Education Department and the Jizhong Literary Association will hire specialists to organize an award evaluation committee to be responsible for the evaluation. The propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels must be responsible for recommending works to the award evaluation committee. New opera scripts and new singing scripts should be reviewed by the county and municipal Party committee propaganda departments, education sections, and youth leagues before being performed locally. (7) Literary and artistic activities must be closely combined with this winter's literacy classes to strengthen the education of the masses with new ideas through the content of literary and artistic activities. (8) Cadres participating in Party rectification or land reform in the countryside must directly help township art activities and cooperate with and promote the central work by strengthening township art activities.
