　　Annihilation of the Headquarters of the 48th Brigade
　　The battle in Nan Suluo Village, where the enemy's 48th Brigade headquarters was located, is nearing its end. The defeated enemy is scurrying around everywhere. Du Chufēi, director of the newsroom of the 48th Brigade, forced more than 40 remaining enemies at the brigade headquarters to hold on to a courtyard on the west side of the village, making a desperate struggle.
　　Qi Wanlu, the squad leader of the 8th squad of a certain company of our "East Society" unit, led his entire squad to climb onto another rooftop to pressure the enemy. There was a碉楼 [blockhouse or pillbox] in the courtyard where the enemy was holed up. At this time, Squad Leader Qi thought that to eliminate this enemy, it was necessary to go around to the back to attack. But there was no ladder to get off the roof. In order to be quick, he took the lead in jumping off the roof and went around to the street behind the enemy. The enemy in the碉楼 discovered that our army had gone around to the back and immediately used machine guns and grenades to block the main street. Squad Leader Qi led his entire squad to advance along both sides of the street, taking advantage of every opportunity. With their brave and rapid movements, they occupied a small temple opposite the enemy's碉楼. Although Squad Leader Qi had already been wounded in two places on his face and waist, he was not flustered at all. With accurate firepower, he blocked the loopholes of the碉楼 and approached the courtyard occupied by the enemy.
　　At this time, they had no tools to get on the roof, but the enemy's碉楼 was very high. So they went around to the outside of the west wall of the courtyard and climbed up using human ladders. The enemy was completely panicked. They completely compressed the enemy into the courtyard. Twenty-nine enemies surrendered to them. During the search, they found another eleven enemies in a wheat stack. One of them, a medium-sized man who claimed to be a "special agent chief," was Du Chufēi, the director of the newsroom.

　　歼四十八旅旅部
    敌四十八旅旅部所在地的南酥酪村的战斗接近尾声了。被打垮了的敌人到处乱窜。四十八旅新闻室主任杜出非，强迫旅部四十多个残敌，困守村西头一座院落作垂死的挣扎。
    我“东社”部某连八班长祁万禄带领全班爬上了另外的房顶向敌压迫。敌人困守的院落有一座碉楼。这时祁班长一想，要消灭这股敌人非绕到后面去进攻不可。但下房没有梯，为了迅速，他就带头跳下房去，绕到敌人后面的街上。碉楼上的敌人发现我军已绕到后面，立即以机枪、手榴弹封锁大街，祁班长带领全班沿街道两侧各个跃进，他们以勇猛迅速的动作占领了敌人碉楼对面的一座小庙。祁班长脸上、腰上虽已两处负伤，但他一点不慌，以准确的火力封锁了碉楼的枪眼，接近了敌人占领的院落。
    这时，他们没有上房的工具，敌人的碉楼却很高。于是他们绕到这座院落的西围墙外，搭人梯爬了上去。敌人完全慌乱了。他们把敌人完全压缩在院子里。二十九个敌人向他们缴了枪。搜索时，他们在一个麦草堆里又发现十一个敌人。其中一个中等个子自称是“特务长”的，就是新闻室主任杜出非。
