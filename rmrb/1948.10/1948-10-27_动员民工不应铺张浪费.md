　　Mobilizing Laborers Should Not Be Extravagant and Wasteful

　　This time, for the front-line support effort, the task of two stretchers was assigned to Chengguan North Gate in Jingxing. The district repeatedly urged them to prepare for the front-line support. The village cadres didn't take it seriously, and when the task arrived, they were caught off guard. According to Yu Shengyuan, a member of the Support-the-Army Committee, the second and third echelons were to go this time, which meant two stretchers, ten people. When the time came, four people were not at home, and the village cadres temporarily found four people. Due to poor mobilization methods, the team members were emotional and unwilling to go, making sarcastic remarks. The village cadres were in a difficult position and came up with some improper ways to solve the problem. First, they bought cloth for eight team members to make clothes. One team member wore a whole set, and the remaining seven each received one piece, totaling seven zhang four chi four cun of white and black cloth (including for backpacks), spending 96,000 yuan in foreign currency. Six pairs of shoes were bought at 6,000 yuan per pair, costing 36,000 yuan in foreign currency, and each person was given 10,000 yuan in pocket money. During the gathering, they ate three meals of "juanzi" (steamed buns), costing 22,000 yuan in foreign currency. Before leaving, they had another meal, with village Farmers' Association Director Liu Weishi, security guard Li Yulin, squad leader Shuan Gen, and Support-the-Army Committee member Yu Shengyuan accompanying them. Fourteen people drank two jin of white wine, four plates of stir-fried meat, two plates of vegetables, eleven plates of fried pancakes, and twenty-eight bowls of white noodles, costing 20,000 yuan in foreign currency (excluding the wine money). The total cost was 274,000 yuan in foreign currency. If the wine money is added, each team member spent an average of 28,000 yuan in foreign currency. After eating and drinking, they were supposed to leave, but the district issued an instruction that the village's task had changed, and they would not be leaving this time, so they didn't go. The masses have reacted very negatively.

　　The money had been spent, so the village cadres had to find a way to cover the expenses. Where would the money come from? So, it was decided to raise funds from the merchants. In collaboration with the street's Chamber of Commerce, the expenses were distributed to each household. Small businesses paid a minimum of 1,000 yuan, and large businesses paid 2,000 yuan. Group leaders of the merchants were summoned to convey the order. As a result, 62,200 yuan was mobilized, but it was not enough to cover the nearly 300,000 yuan. When I asked them how they would cover the expenses, village Farmers' Association Director Liu Weishi said: "It's not a problem, we will pay from our village cooperative."

　　In today's situation of financial and economic difficulties, it is already a mistake to eat and drink lavishly, squander money at will, fail to adhere to the system, and be extravagant and wasteful. Randomly increasing the burden on merchants is a violation of the industrial and commercial policy. I hope that the relevant departments will conduct a thorough inspection and handle the matter properly.

### 动员民工不应铺张浪费

　　动员民工不应铺张浪费
    这一次支前，两付担架的任务分配到井陉城北关，区里再三督促他们准备支前，村干部不当回事，任务来了便临时抓瞎。据优抗委员于生元说，这一次轮着第二与第三梯队去，这两梯队就是两付担架，十个人，到时有四个人不在家，村干部即临时找了四个人。由于动员方式不好，队员闹情绪，不愿去，说怪话。村干部作了难，即想出些不正当的办法来解决问题。首先给八个队员买布作衣服，其中有一个队员穿了一身，其余七人每人一件，共用白黑布七丈四尺四（作背包在内），花洋九万六千元。买了六双鞋，每双六千，花洋三万六千元，每人又带了一万元的零花。集合当中吃了三顿卷子，花洋二万二千元。临走时又会餐一次，由村农会主任刘维士、治安员李玉林、中队长拴艮、优抗委员于生元四人作陪，十四个人喝白酒二斤，炒肉盘四个，素盘两个，炒饼十一盘，白面二十八碗。花洋二万元（酒钱不在内）。总共花洋二十七万四千元。若再加上酒钱，平均每个队员得花洋二万八千。吃了喝了就该走了，不料区里来了指示，这个村的任务变动，这一次不出发了，也就没走。群众反映实在不好。
    款子是花出去了，村干部就得想办法开支，款从那里来呢？于是决定在商户身上募。协同该街商会按户摊派，小商最少一千，大商两千，召集商户组长来传达执行。结果动员出六万二千二百元还不能解决近卅万元的大数，我问他们如何开支时，村农会主任刘维士说：“不成问题，从我们村联社内开支。”
    在今天财政经济困难的情况下，大吃大喝，随便挥霍不坚持制度，铺张浪费，已经是个错误；随便加重商户的负担，又是违反工商业政策行为。我希望有关部门很好的检查，妥当处理。
