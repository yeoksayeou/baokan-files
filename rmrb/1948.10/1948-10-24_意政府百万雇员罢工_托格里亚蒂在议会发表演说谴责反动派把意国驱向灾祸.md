Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. Reports from various sources: Approximately one million Italian government employees staged a half-day strike on the 14th to protest the government's refusal to immediately increase wages. Immediately after the strike began, telephone service in Rome was paralyzed, no one was working in the Prime Minister's office, all employees of the Merchant Marine Department went on strike, 80 percent of the Labor Department employees went on strike, and 20 percent of the Ministry of Agriculture employees also went on strike. Most post offices did not open, and railway workers also went on strike for two hours. United Press stated: "The strike on the 14th is the beginning of government employee unrest, and such strikes will spread to various provinces one after another." Strikers in Rome held a mass meeting on the 14th, chanting slogans in support of the General Confederation of Labor's proposal to immediately increase wages, distribute bonuses, and increase pensions. Vittorio, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, addressed the meeting, stating: "Unless the government agrees to increase the salaries of government employees, the seven million members of the General Confederation of Labor will hold a general strike." (Associated Press) Commenting on the current situation of the Italian people's struggle, the Soviet Red Star newspaper stated that the reactionaries in Italy and the United States are encountering increasing opposition from the Italian working masses. For more than three months, a wave of strikes has swept Italy, including an eight-million-person general strike to protest the assassination attempt on Togliatti, a strike by three million agricultural workers, and a general strike in Sicily to protest police terror. All of this proves that the Italian people will resolutely fight to the end against the attacks of domestic and foreign reactionaries.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. Togliatti, Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, delivered a lengthy speech in Parliament on the 14th, condemning the reactionaries for transforming Italy into a police state. Togliatti's speech stated: The government constantly mentions that it supposedly has "sixteen million voters" supporting it domestically. However, not to mention what the American newspapers recently reminded Gasperi, that without American support, his regime would not last even forty-eight hours; domestic events in Italy, primarily the general strike from July 14th to 16th, show that the active and politically conscious majority of the people do not support the government. After this general strike, the government implemented unprecedented retaliation and arrests. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 6,943 people have been subjected to retaliation, a number not reached even during the darkest period of fascist rule. At the same time, the Italian government is drawing up a budget that provides for maintaining 78,000 security police, a number even larger than the fascist police force. This shows that the domestic situation in Italy is more tense today than it has been since April 25, 1945 (the day of the liberation uprising in Northern Italy). This situation proves that there is a profound division between the Italian government and the powerful organized forces of the people. Togliatti condemned the Italian government for relying on international reactionaries, saying: The government is serving foreign interests and is driving Italy towards disaster, and is depriving the Italian nation of the most favorable opportunity for regeneration in its history. Togliatti continued: Today's Italy has not yet achieved the situation that the Minister of Interior hopes for, because there exists a great organized force that resolutely defends the democratic and constitutional freedoms. Togliatti finally emphasized that our responsibility is to oppose the government, which is acting as a pawn for foreign powers, from achieving its pursued goals. What we have struggled for in the past and will continue to struggle for in the future is to unite forces in Italian society to prevent the reactionaries from transforming Italy into a police state, and to prevent the reactionaries from dragging Italy into a war conducted for foreign interests.

　　意政府百万雇员罢工
  　托格里亚蒂在议会发表演说谴责反动派把意国驱向灾祸
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方报导：为抗议政府拒绝立即增加薪资，意大利政府雇员约一百万人于十四日举行大半日罢工。罢工开始以后，罗马电话立即陷于停顿，总理办公室没有一个人办公，商航部雇员全体罢工，劳工部罢工者达百分之八十，农业部亦占百分之二十。大多数邮政局都没有开门，铁路工人亦罢工两小时。合众社称：“十四日的罢工，是政府雇员波动的开始，这种罢工将一个接一个地波及各省。”罗马罢工者于十四日举行群众大会，高呼拥护总工会所提立即增加工资分发花红及增加养老金的方案。总工会总书记维托里奥向大会发表演说称：“除非政府答应增加政府雇员薪资的要求，总工会七百万会员将举行总罢工。”（美联社）在论及目前意大利人民斗争的形势时，苏联红星报评称，意大利及美国的反动派，正遇到意大利劳动群众越来越大的反对。三个多月来罢工浪潮席卷着意大利，有因抗议谋刺托格里亚蒂而举行的八百万人总罢工，还有三百万农业工人的罢工，西西里也发生过抗议警察恐怖的总罢工。所有这一切都证明意大利人民将坚决地对国内外反动派的进攻作战到底。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】意共总书记托格里亚蒂于十四日在议会发表长篇演说，谴责反动派正将意大利转变成为警察国家。托格里亚蒂演说略称：政府不时提到据说是在国内支持它的有“一千六百万选民”。然而，且不说美国报纸最近所提醒加斯贝利的话，即假如没有美国的支持，他的政权连四十八小时都无法维持；而意大利国内的事件，首先是七月十四日至十六日的总罢工说明：积极和政治上觉悟的大多数人民都不支持政府。在这次总罢工之后，政府实行空前的报复和逮捕。据不完全的统计，受到报复的，总数有六千九百四十三人，即使在最黑暗的法西斯统治时期，也没有达到这样大的数字。同时，意政府正制定预算，规定保持比法西斯警察数目还大得多的七万八千名治安警察。这显示出：自一九四五年四月二十五日（北意解放起义之日）以来，意大利国内形势之紧张已无过于今日。这一形势证明了意大利政府和有组织的强大的人民力量之间存在着深刻的分裂。托格里亚蒂谴责意政府依靠国际反动派说：政府替外国服务，正把意大利驱向灾祸，并正在剥夺着意大利民族有史以来最有利的再生的机会。托格里亚蒂继称：今天的意大利还没有实现如内政部长所希望的情况，这是因为存在着坚决维护民主宪法自由的伟大的有组织的力量。托格里亚蒂最后强调指出：我们的责任就是反对充任外国走卒的政府实现其所追求的目的。我们过去并且将来也要继续为其奋斗的，是在意大利社会中团结力量，以阻止反动派将意大利转变为一反警察国家，阻止反动派将意大利卷入为外国利益而进行的战争中。
