Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS, Paris: The general debate at the United Nations General Assembly plenary session concluded on September 29th. The Foreign Ministers of Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine, in their respective speeches to the Assembly, unanimously supported the three proposals put forward by the Soviet government to the Assembly, and emphatically criticized the statement made by British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the Assembly. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Clementis pointed out: "Bevin's statement, in the final analysis, is to abandon the concept of the United Nations and encourage the establishment of mutually opposed national blocs." In his speech to the Assembly on the 27th, Bevin openly advocated dividing the United Nations into groups like the Western European Union. He said, "If we cannot continue on a worldwide basis as we hoped, then we must continue on a regional basis." Like Bevin, a prominent feature of the speeches by other representatives of the US-British bloc at the Assembly was to avoid discussing the Soviet Union's three proposals on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. However, when the Steering Committee discussed whether the Soviet proposals should be included in the agenda of the Assembly, the representatives of the US-British bloc dared not openly refuse. The Soviet Union's three proposals were unanimously passed at the Steering Committee meeting on the 28th, and accepted by the General Assembly that afternoon, included in the formal agenda of the Assembly. According to the established rules of the Assembly, the case will first be submitted to the First Committee of the Assembly (i.e., the Political and Security Committee) for discussion.

　　联大结束一般性发言
    苏联三点建议列入正式议程
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会全体会议上的一般性演说已于九月二十九日结束。捷克、白俄罗斯、南斯拉夫与乌克兰外长先后在大会上的发言，一致拥护苏联政府向大会提出的三点建议，并着重地抨击英外相贝文在大会上的声明。捷外长克里门蒂斯指出：“贝文的声明，归根结底，就是抛弃联合国的观念，鼓励成立相互对立的国家集团。”贝文二十七日在大会上的发言，曾公开主张将联合国分裂为西欧联盟式的集团。他说：“如果我们不能如我们所希望的在全世界的基础上继续下去，则我们必须要在区域的基础上予以继续。”和贝文一样，美英集团其他各国代表在大会发言的显著特点，是避免讨论苏联关于裁军与禁止原子武器的三点建议。但当指导委员会讨论苏联的建议是否应列入大会议程时，美英集团的代表也不敢公然拒绝。苏联的三点建议在指委会二十八日会上获一致通过，并由当日下午大会加以接受，列入大会的正式议程中。按照大会既定规则，该案将首先交由大会第一委员会（即政治安全委员会）讨论。
