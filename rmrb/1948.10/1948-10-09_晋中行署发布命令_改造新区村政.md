Jinzhong Administrative Office Issues Order to Transform Village Administration in Newly Liberated Areas

[Jinzhong Telegram] To standardize and reorganize village administrative institutions in newly liberated areas of Jinzhong, and to establish a unified fiscal system, the Jinzhong Administrative Office has issued Civil Affairs Order No. 1, instructing all subordinate commissioners, mayors, and county heads to comply with its execution. The order first points out that, generally, village administration in the newly liberated areas of Jinzhong is controlled by feudal landlords and rich peasants. Although in some places, the governing members are middle and poor peasants, feudal forces are still manipulating them from behind. Therefore, in terms of burdens, those who have connections are lightly taxed, while the masses are heavily taxed. Moreover, whenever there are major or minor events, they enshrine a pot on the temple and indulge in extravagant eating and drinking. As for corruption and waste, the amounts are even greater. Since Jinzhong was liberated by our army, the people have been extremely dissatisfied with these old regime personnel. If we continue to rely on these people to maintain the regime, we will inevitably become detached from the masses, affecting the progress of various tasks. On the other hand, due to the "soldier-peasant unity" tyranny implemented by Yan Xishan, the people's lives are difficult. As the masses are eager to resume production, they fear losing work. Furthermore, due to illiteracy and other factors, they are unwilling to step forward and take responsibility, thus creating the current difficulties in village administration work. Based on the above situation, the order points out that the village administration in the new areas must be reorganized and proposes the following measures:

For those with a working foundation in the past, select activists from the masses to serve as village administrative cadres. Or appoint cadres who transferred and persisted in the struggle against the enemy after the enemy's invasion and who have gained the support of the masses (such as in Wenxi, Fenyang, and other places). For villages and towns where there is no foundation in the past, but our county and district cadres can regularly grasp the situation, active elements can be selected from among those supporting the front and production to serve as village administrative cadres, replacing those who harm the interests of the masses. If the leadership is unable to attend to the situation in time, the transformation of village administration power should adopt different methods and steps. If the entire village administration is controlled by feudal forces, it must be abolished, and a new regime organized by farmers and impartial people elected by the people. If, in addition to impartial people, there are individual feudal reactionaries, these elements should be replaced as soon as possible. As for those who are not opposed by the masses and can serve the masses and carry out work, they should not be moved at all.

The order points out that the transformation must be carried out in a step-by-step and planned manner. It is wrong to believe that the regime cannot be transformed until land reform is implemented. At the same time, it also points out that it is impossible to transform it well all at once. Because to transform the old regime institutions in the new area very well, it is necessary to mobilize the masses. Currently, due to various objective circumstances, this cannot be done. Regarding the organization and funding of the village, it is generally stipulated that 250 households or more constitute an administrative village. The supply of the village regime, the village cadres who are separated from production, and the funding are all based on the number of households, and there are already specific regulations. Regarding the village fiscal system, the order emphasizes that all village apportionment rights should be abolished, and a strict system of village fiscal expenditure should be stipulated. Its expenditures are collected together with the public grain and uniformly disbursed from the public grain. Regarding village education expenses, the order strictly stipulates that expenditures should be made according to the standards stipulated by the county government. Apportionments within the village should be made according to the number and submitted to the county government for approval. Those who exceed the regulations will be charged with embezzlement. Those who have school fields and public fields to fund education expenses are not allowed to apportion. However, they must still pay according to the prescribed standards and must not exceed them.

　　晋中行署发布命令
    改造新区村政
    【晋中电】晋中行署为统一整理新解放区村政机构，及确立统一财政制度，特颁发民政字第一号命令，饬令所属各专员市县长遵照执行。命令首先指出，目前晋中新区村政一般为封建地主富农所掌握，虽然有些地方执政成份为中、贫农，但封建势力仍在背后操纵。所以在负担上，对其有关系者摊派轻，对群众则摊派重。并每遇大小事，即上庙安锅，大吃二喝。至于贪污浪费，数目更大。晋中经我军解放后，人民对这些旧政权人员极为不满，如我们仍靠这些人维持政权，势必脱离群众，影响各项工作进行。另一方面，又因阎匪实行“兵农合一”暴政，群众生活困难，在群众极欲恢复生产下，怕误工，更因不识字等，自己又不愿起来负责，因之形成当前村政工作上的困难。根据以上情况，命令指出：新区的村政必须整理。并提出办法如下：过去有工作基础者，从群众中选拔积极分子担任村政干部。或由敌侵占后转移出来坚持与敌斗争，得到群众拥护的分子任村政干部（如文、汾等地）。过去无基础，但我县区干部能经常掌握之村镇，可经支前生产中选拔积极分子担任村政干部，代替那些损害群众利益的分子。如领导上无暇顾及时，村政权之改造应采取不同办法与步骤。如掌握村政全为封建势力者，须废除，由人民选举之农民和公正人组织新政权。如除公正人外尚有个别封建反动者，应将这种分子早些换掉。至于不为群众反对，并能为群众服务，进行工作者，一律不动。命令指出：必须有步骤有计划的进行改造。认为尚没实行土改就不能改造政权，是错误的。同时也指出，想一下子就改造好也不可能。因为要将新区之旧政权机构改造得很好，必须发动群众。现在因各种客观情况，尚不能这样进行。关于村的组织和经费，一般规定二百五十户以上为一行政村。村政权供给，脱离生产之村干部及经费，均根据户口多寡，已有具体规定。关于村财政制度，命令强调指出应废除村的一切摊派权，严格规定村财政开支制度。其开支同公粮一并征收。由公粮内统一开支。关于村教育费，命令严格规定照县府规定之标准开支。村内照数摊派，呈请县府批准。超过规定者以贪污论罪。有学田公田以资教育费者，不准摊派。但仍须按规定标准支付，不得超过。
