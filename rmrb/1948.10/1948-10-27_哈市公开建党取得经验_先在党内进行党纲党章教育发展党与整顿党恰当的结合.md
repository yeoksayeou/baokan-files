Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: The policy of openly building the Party has yielded some experience in Harbin, a city with a large population where local Party organizations are still small and have weak ties with the masses. Since late June, when Harbin adopted a step-by-step approach to openly building the Party, over the past three months, in addition to the majority of branches in municipal and district-level organs being open or preparing to be open, there have been four state-owned factory branches, one private factory branch, four rural branches, one army general branch, and one cadre school general branch that have openly developed Party organizations. The development of Party organizations has also begun in a step-by-step manner in other factories without branches. In the process of openly consolidating and building the Party, Party members and the masses have been educated, the ties between the Party and the masses have been strengthened, the Party's organization and influence have been expanded, and Party life has been improved. The Harbin Municipal Party Committee recently made a preliminary summary of the experience of openly building the Party, which mainly includes the following four points:

(1) It is essential to conduct education on the Party Program and Constitution within the Party, first among cadres and Party members, with a particular emphasis on the principles of the mass line and the mass viewpoint, as well as practical reviews. For general Party members, popular explanations are provided through classes, and they are assisted in resolving some specific issues in Party building, such as the criteria for mass awareness and how to address the various specific issues raised by the masses. Combining ideological Party building with organizational Party building closely, open Party building can achieve practical results.

(2) When conducting open Party building, each unit must specifically understand the current ideological state and political sentiment of the masses, patiently identify the various doubts among the masses, and then, in light of these circumstances, use various appropriate methods to conduct full explanation and education, establish the correct understanding of the masses toward the Party, and raise the activists among the masses to the Party's ideological level, as the ideological foundation for open Party building.

(3) At present, the organizational foundation of the Party in Harbin is still very small. Therefore, consolidating the Party and developing the Party should be appropriately combined. In units that already have Party branches, the first step is to openly consolidate the branch, absorb the participation of the masses in a planned and step-by-step manner, and implement mass-based review and assessment. The branch's review of work achievements and shortcomings should be appropriate. Especially when summarizing achievements, there must be a clear mass viewpoint, otherwise it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses. However, erroneous opinions raised by the masses should also be appropriately explained. Better Party members should report the process of their ideological transformation and the Party's cultivation and education; and appropriately review shortcomings. Party members who are divorced from the masses must make a public self-criticism and admit their mistakes. This can educate Party members, educate the masses, strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and enhance the masses' understanding and concern for the Party. After such open consolidation of the Party, many new activists will request to join the Party, and the Party can be openly developed in a step-by-step manner. As for units that originally did not have branches, the following methods can be used: First, send Party organizers to work. Second, assign Party members who are responsible for trade union or other work in the unit to carry out the task of developing the Party. Third, take some major industry and trade union or branch associations as units, conduct Party education through organizing workers' vocational training, and then gradually develop the Party. Fourth, organize mass activists to participate in the open consolidation of branches in neighboring units or hold Party membership ceremonies, etc., to enhance the masses' understanding of the Party. When openly developing Party organizations, in any unit, the method of "self-reporting, public discussion, and Party approval" (in places with branches, it must be discussed and decided by the branch general meeting) should be adopted, as well as individual understanding, individual cultivation, individual review, and approval. At present, Party building in Harbin generally focuses on development, consolidating in the process of development, but in some units, Party members already account for a considerable majority, then consolidation should be the focus, and development should be appropriately carried out on the basis of consolidation.

(4) Party building work must be closely integrated with all aspects of work and made a regular part of the Party's work. Party members working in trade unions must regard Party building work as one of their regular tasks, and pay special attention to cultivating and absorbing conscious and skilled workers into the Party. Party members working in other areas should do the same. The Party Committee should deploy, conduct, inspect, and supervise this work through the branch.

The Harbin Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Correctly Implement the Policy of Open Party Building," pointing out that according to the experience of open Party building in some major branches, it proves that the Northeast Bureau's policy of open Party consolidation and Party building is not only suitable in rural areas, but also in cities (as long as they are consolidated basic areas). The editorial also pointed out that on the one hand, it is necessary to continue to overcome the closed-doorist viewpoint in Party building, and on the other hand, it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of formalistic understanding of open Party building, only pursuing numbers and not paying attention to quality.

### 哈市公开建党取得经验　先在党内进行党纲党章教育发展党与整顿党恰当的结合

　　哈市公开建党取得经验
  　先在党内进行党纲党章教育发展党与整顿党恰当的结合
    【新华社东北二十四日电】执行公开建党的方针，在哈尔滨这样人口众多，党的地方组织还很小，与群众的联系也还很弱的地方，得到了若干经验。哈尔滨市自六月下旬采取有步骤的公开建党方针后，三个月来，除市、区两级机关支部大部公开或准备公开外，已有四个公营工厂支部，一个私营工厂支部，四个农村支部，一个部队总支部及一个干部学校总支部，已公开并发展了党的组织。其他没有支部的工厂中亦开始有步骤地发展党的组织。在这一公开整党建党过程中，教育了党员与群众，密切了党与群众的联系，扩大了党的组织和党的影响。健全了党的生活。哈市市委日前初步总结了公开建党经验，主要有以下四点：
    （一）必须在党内，首先在干部党员中进行党纲党章教育，特别着重群众路线与群众观点的原则教育与实际检讨。对一般党员则用上课方法进行通俗讲解，并帮助他们解决建党中的一些具体问题，如群众觉悟的标准及如何解决群众所提出的各种具体问题等。使思想建党与组织建党密切结合，公开党才能收到实际效果。
    （二）在进行公开建党时，每一单位必须具体了解群众现在的思想状况和政治情绪，耐心发现群众中的各种疑虑，然后针对这些情况，用各种适当的方式进行充分的解释和教育，建立群众对党的正确认识，并把群众中积极分子提高到党的思想水平，作为公开建党的群众思想基础。
    （三）目前哈尔滨的党的组织基础还很小，因此整顿党与发展党应恰当的结合。在已有党的支部的单位，首先公开整顿支部，有计划有步骤地吸收群众参加，实行群众性的审查与鉴定。支部检讨工作成绩及缺点时要恰当。特别在总结成绩时，要有明确的群众观点，否则会引起群众不满。但对群众所提出的错误意见，也应恰当地进行解释。较好的党员应报告自己思想转变经过，党的培养教育；并适当检讨缺点。脱离群众的党员一定要当众检讨，承认错误。这样可以教育党员，教育群众，加强党与群众的联系，提高群众对党的认识和关心。在这样公开整党后，就会有许多新的积极分子要求入党，即可有步骤地公开发展党。至于原来没有支部的单位，可用以下几种办法：一、派遣党的组织员去工作。二、责成该单位中担负工会或其他工作的党员执行发展党的任务。三、以某些主要行庄工会或分会为单位，通过组织工人的业务训练，进行党的教育，然后逐步发展党。四、组织群众积极分子参加邻近单位公开整顿支部或举行入党仪式等。提高群众对党的认识。在公开发展党的组织时，无论在那一种单位，均应采取既经过“自报、公义、党批准”（在有支部的地方，要经过支部大会的讨论决定），又经过个别了解，个别培养，个别审查和批准的方法。目前哈市建党，一般地以发展为主，在发展中进行巩固，但在某些单位，党员已占相当多数，则应以巩固为主，在巩固基础上适当地发展。
    （四）建党工作必需与各方面工作密切结合而使之成为党的经常工作。在工会中工作的党员，必需把建党工作当做经常任务之一，并特别注意培养与吸收有觉悟的技术熟练的工人入党。在其他各方面工作的党员也应如此。党委应通过支部布置、进行、检查与督促这一工作。
    哈尔滨日报日前以“正确执行公开建党的方针”为题发表社论，指出根据部分主要支部公开建党的经验，证明东北局公开整党与建党的方针不仅在乡村中适合，即在城市（只要是巩固的基本地区）也同样适合。社论并指出一方面要继续克服建党中的关门主义观点，另一方面又必须防止形式主义的了解公开建党，只追求数目不注意质量的现象。
