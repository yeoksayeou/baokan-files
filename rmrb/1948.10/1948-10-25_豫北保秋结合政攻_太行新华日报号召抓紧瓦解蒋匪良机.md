　　Yubei Combines Autumn Harvest Protection with Political Offensive
  　Taihang Xinhua Daily Calls for Seizing the Good Opportunity to Disintegrate Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits
    [Taihang Electric] In the Yubei autumn harvest protection struggle, mass political offensives have been launched in some areas of Jiaozuo, Wuzhi, Jixian, Qixian, and Xinxiang. The Propaganda Department of the Five Prefectural Committees has uniformly formulated the content of the autumn political offensive propaganda and printed and distributed the first batch of propaganda materials totaling more than 65,000 copies. It uses various forms to repeatedly publicize the two-year achievements of the Liberation War and the current victorious situation. It also seizes the facts that Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are reorganizing local bandits into regular troops and sending them south to die, calling on Chiang's soldiers not to die for Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuzhi Political Offensive Committee of the Fourth Military Sub-district also instructed its subordinates to convene symposiums of bandit family members in various villages, explaining that the Kuomintang army's 40th Division has been defeated by us several times, and being incorporated into the 40th Division is a dead end. They should try every means to call their relatives back. Jiaozuo called on bandits and puppet personnel to quickly perform meritorious service to redeem themselves, because the life of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yubei is not long. After the propaganda offensive in various places, bandits and puppet family members are trying to find a way out, and at the same time, they are organizing the masses to carry out this work. The villages in the Third District of Jiaozuo have established rescue committees and rescue teams to strengthen the leadership of the political offensive and unify the organization of a wider range of political offensive forces. Most village cadres and militiamen have made political offensive plans. Jixian launched a planned and organized political offensive from September 15th to 18th, mainly organizing the families, relatives, and friends of the puppet army to escape back. They explained our party's policies and dispelled the ideological concerns of the puppet army. Jiaozuo seized the opportunity of the local bandits and puppets fearing being incorporated into the Kuomintang bandit army's 40th Division, and launched a "call for sons to return" and "a letter to save lives" campaign among the puppet family members. They also used examples of our lenient policy to show the puppet army, which indeed dispelled their concerns. The wife of a puppet self-defense team member in Tiejiazhuang, Jiaozuo, automatically ran to persuade her husband to return, saying, "You are doing bad things outside, robbing other people's livestock. What will you end up with! If you don't go back, I will remarry. I can't be implicated with you!" She went three times and finally persuaded her husband to return. An old woman in Beiwang Xiezhuang, Wuzhi, whose son and daughter-in-law were captured by the Kuomintang bandit army in Lifeng Village and forced to become bandit soldiers, went to call them twice. The first time, she called back her daughter-in-law, and the second time, she also called back her son. Xie Shanlin from the same village was a soldier in Xie Rongtang's bandit unit. His wife went twice before persuading him to return. On September 1st, after the Fourth District cadre team of Jixian repelled the armed robbery of grain by the puppet Bigan Township, they put the bodies of the puppet Captain Wu Jili and others in coffins and transported them back. They also pasted letters and propaganda materials to their families and the puppet township government on the coffins. This had a huge impact within the bandit and puppet ranks and they were deeply moved. For example, Yi Tang, a puppet township soldier who escaped back to our area, said, "We all know that the Eighth Route Army's policy is lenient, and they release those they capture alive and send back the dead. I was determined to run back after I was completely desperate." The more than 200 local bandits and puppet township armed forces captured by our army in the battles of Huangfu, Damaidian, Xiaokou, and other places in Qixian were educated and released at any time. After returning home, the cadres and masses took the initiative to resettle them, which had a great impact on the local bandits. The masses generally said, "If we continue to do this, Yang Fuhui's team and the Qixian bandits will collapse even faster." After the armed work team of × County captured and released an enemy tax collector, he openly said to the puppet captain after returning, "It doesn't matter if the Eighth Route Army captures you." According to incomplete statistics in September: a total of 174 bandits, puppet association teams, and township armed forces were won over in Jiaozuo, Xiuwu Second District, Qixian, Jixian, and Xinxiang Shizhuang District, most of whom escaped back to our area to start a new life, and 1,189 fleeing people returned. According to a puppet squad leader who escaped back, "More than one-third of the puppet Xiuwu Security Regiment's Second Battalion have deserted." Qixian's good policy and political offensive achieved good results. In half a month, it won back more than 100 puppet soldiers, greatly weakening the strength of the bandit Yang Fu.
    [Also Electric] In Yubei, due to our specific measures to correct policies, from spring to the end of August, 47,500 fleeing people in 14 counties of the Fourth and Fifth Military Sub-districts have returned to the liberated areas to produce and build homes (the figures for eight counties in July and August are missing), including many landlords and rich peasants.
    [Taihang Electric] The Taihang Xinhua Daily specially published a short article on the 16th of this month, calling on the military and civilians in the border areas of Yubei to seize the good opportunity to launch a comprehensive political offensive, saying: Our army's great victory in liberating Jinan and the strong autumn offensive in various liberated areas, the two regiments of the Kuomintang bandit army's 40th Division in Yubei were forced to be transferred south, and their repeated attacks to seize grain have been attacked by us. The Kuomintang bandit army is very panicked internally. At the same time, due to the enemy's frenzied conscription and expansion of regular troops, the bandits are extremely shaken and are fleeing one after another. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the masses see the situation of Chiang Kai-shek and the puppets' inevitable defeat more and more clearly, and the people's hearts are increasingly turning to us. The above favorable situation is indeed an excellent opportunity to combine military attacks, quickly launch political offensives, and disintegrate the bandits.
    How to carry out it? First of all, the party, government, army, and people should cooperate, launch an organized and led propaganda offensive against the enemy, organize and mobilize all forces, uniformly formulate propaganda content, take unified steps, and mobilize the masses to publicize our army's victory in liberating Jinan and the autumn offensive in various places, using various propaganda methods and through various relationships, to the Chiang Kai-shek army and the masses in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, expose the enemy's deceptive propaganda, shake and disintegrate the enemy army. At the same time, seize the facts of the enemy's southern transfer and expansion of regular troops, and launch a campaign among the puppet army's family members to call for sons and demand husbands, so as not to let their relatives sell their lives for Chiang Kai-shek. Repeatedly explain our party's policies, compare General Wu Huawen's uprising with Wang Yaowu's capture, and call on Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army to take Wu Huawen's path.
    Secondly, the political offensive should be combined with autumn harvest protection. After a general propaganda offensive, the cadres and masses should recognize the current favorable situation, boost their morale, and mobilize and organize the masses to quickly complete the storage of grain and prepare for war to starve the enemy. Clarify the consistency between the political offensive and autumn harvest protection, overcome any one-sided views that only focus on storing grain and not engaging in political offensives, and closely combine the two and make specific arrangements.
    In order to achieve greater success in the political offensive, we must firmly grasp the policy in the process, and continue to promote the spirit of correcting policies, expanding the united front in the border areas, and uniting against the enemy since the summer. Check what problems exist in our specific implementation. On the one hand, we must further distinguish between boundaries and clarify the correct standards of the policy in order to correct the phenomenon of cadres swaying left and right in the implementation of the policy, and overcome the narrow-minded "eliminating harm" and preventing disaster blind revenge views among village cadres, militiamen, and the masses. On the other hand, we should conduct comparative education with historical experience and lessons, carry out mass conscious political offensive movements, strengthen ourselves, isolate the enemy, and further advance our border positions.

　　豫北保秋结合政攻
  　太行新华日报号召抓紧瓦解蒋匪良机
    【太行电】豫北保秋斗争中，群众性的政治攻势已在焦作、武陟、汲县、淇县、新乡等部分地区开展。五地委宣传部曾统一制定了秋季政攻宣传内容，并印发了第一批宣传品共达六万五千余份，利用各种形式，反复宣传解放战争两年战绩和目前胜利形势，并抓住蒋匪将地方土匪改编正规军南调送死的等等事实，号召蒋军士兵不替蒋贼送命。四分区武陟政攻委员会亦指示所属召开各村匪属座谈会，说明国民党军四十师曾几次被我打垮过，被编了四十师只有死路一条，要想尽一切办法把自己亲人叫回来才好。焦作号召匪伪人员赶快立功赎罪，因为豫北蒋匪的寿命已不长了。各地经过宣传攻势，土匪、伪属都在想法找出路，同时并组织群众进行这一工作。焦作三区各村成立救命委员会及救命小组，以加强政攻领导与统一组织更广泛的政攻力量。大部村干民兵均订了政攻计划。汲县有计划有组织的于九月十五至十八日发动了政治攻势，主要是组织伪军家属、亲戚、朋友往回逃。解释我党政策，解除伪军思想顾虑。焦作抓住了当地匪伪恐怕被编为国民党匪军四十师的时机，发动伪属展开叫子要夫与一封信救命运动。并用我宽大政策的实例给伪军看，确实解除其顾虑。焦作铁匠庄一个伪自卫队员的女人自动跑去劝他丈夫回来，说：“你在外边干坏事，抢人家的牲口，看你将来落个啥下场！你要不回去，我就另嫁人，我不能跟着你受连累！”连去三次，终于把他丈夫动员回来了。武陟北王谢庄上一位老婆婆，她的儿子和媳妇在李封村被国民党匪军抓去，被迫当了匪兵，她一连去叫了两次，头一次叫回媳妇来，二次把儿子也叫回来了。该村谢山林在谢荣堂匪部当兵，他女人亲去了二次才叫回来。九月一日汲县四区区干队在打退伪比干乡武装抢粮后，将伪中队长武吉利等的尸首装到棺材里转回去，棺材上并贴着给其家属、伪乡公所的信与宣传品，这在匪伪内部影响巨大，均深受感动。如逃回我区的伪乡丁伊堂说：“我们都知道八路军政策宽大，活捉住放回，死的也送回，说啥是啥。我是蹬底后才坚决跑回来的。”我军在淇县皇甫、大麦店、小河口等战斗中俘虏的二百余土匪伪乡镇武装，均随时教育随时释放，回家后干部群众主动的予以安置，对当地土匪影响甚大。群众普遍舆论：“象这样做下去，杨富会队、淇县土匪垮得更快。”×县武工队捉住敌讨款员释放后，他回去公开向伪中队长说：“八路军捉住你也不要紧。”总计九月份不完全统计：焦作、修武二区、淇县、汲县、新乡师庄区共争取瓦解匪伪会队乡镇武装一百七十四名，其中大部均逃回我区自新安业，并有一千一百名又八十九户逃亡群众返回。据逃回之伪某班长说：“伪修武保安团二大队已逃亡者在三分之一以上。”淇县端正政策开展政攻搞的好，半月即争取回伪军百余名，大大削弱了土匪杨富的力量。
    【又电】豫北由于我端正政策的具体措施，从春天到八月底止，四、五分区十四个县已有四万七千五百多逃亡群众返回解放区生产建家（其中七、八两月缺八个县的数字），其中亦有不少地主富农。
    【太行电】太行新华日报特于本月十六日发表短论，号召豫北边地军民抓紧良机，全面开展政攻称：我军解放济南的大胜利与各解放区强大的秋季攻势，豫北国民党匪军整四十师两个团被迫南调，抢粮进犯又屡遭我打击，国民党匪军内部十分恐慌。同时由于敌疯狂抓丁，扩编正规军，土匪异常动摇，纷纷逃跑，国民党统治区，群众对蒋伪必败的情势看得愈加明显，人心日趋向我。上述有利形势，实是结合军事出击、迅速展开政治攻势、瓦解土匪的极好良机。
    如何开展呢？首先是党政军民协同一致，有组织有领导的向敌发动一个宣传攻势，组织动员一切力量，统一制定宣传内容，统一步骤，发动群众把我军解放济南及各地秋季攻势的胜利，用各式各样的宣传方式，通过各种关系，宣传给蒋伪军及国民党统治区的群众，揭发敌人欺骗宣传，动摇与瓦解敌军，同时抓住敌人南调与扩编正规军的事实，发动伪军家属展开叫子索夫运动，不让自己的亲人去替蒋贼卖命。反复讲明我党政策，把吴化文将军的起义与王耀武的被擒对照起来，号召蒋匪军走吴化文的路。
    其次，开展政攻要与保秋结合，经过普遍的宣传攻势，使干部群众认识目前有利形势，鼓舞斗志，动员组织群众赶快完成藏粮备战，以困饿敌人。明确政攻与保秋的一致性，克服任何只顾藏粮不稿政攻等片面观点，两者密切结合，具体安排。
    为使政攻获得更大成绩，在进行中必须紧紧掌握政策，继续发扬我入夏以来端正政策、扩大边地统一战线、团结对敌的精神。检查我们在具体执行中存在着什么问题，一方面要进一步分清界线，明确政策的正确标准，以纠正干部在执行政策中的左右摇摆现象，克服村干民兵群众中狭隘的“除害”防祸盲目报复观点，一方面以历史的经验教训，进行对比教育，开展群众性的自觉政攻运动，壮大自己，孤立敌人，使我之边沿阵地更向前推进一步。
