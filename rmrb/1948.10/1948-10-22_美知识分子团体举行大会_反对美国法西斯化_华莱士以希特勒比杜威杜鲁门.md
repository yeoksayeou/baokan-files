Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS, New York: The American National Association of Scientists, Artists, and Professionals recently held a congress here from October 9th to 10th under the slogan of defending the rights of teachers and scientists in American schools and research institutes. Two hundred and fifty representatives from the association's nineteen national branches attended. The congress heard numerous reports of professors being dismissed or threatened for supporting Wallace or expressing progressive opinions, and also heard many speeches opposing the fascistization of the United States. Columbia University Professor Watson pointed out that wealthy and powerful financial groups are using unprecedented economic power to launch an anti-democratic movement because they fear the rapid growth of democratic ideas in many countries, and are particularly shocked by the strength of the Soviet Union. Watson went on to point out that the current situation in the United States is similar to that in Germany before Hitler seized power, and called on the American people to be vigilant and oppose all threats of fascism. The chairman of the association's legal committee, former Deputy Attorney General Rogge, declared in a speech that legal defense committees would be established in various states to defend those who have been attacked for having progressive political views. The congress finally passed a resolution calling for the abolition of the Un-American Activities Committee, condemning Truman's "loyalty" investigation, and urging teachers to unite with trade unions and other progressive groups to fight the growing fascist threat.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: American Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace continues to criticize the reactionary "two-party foreign policy" of the United States during his campaign travels in various states. According to a United Press report, Wallace delivered a speech in Tacoma, Washington, on the 9th, comparing Truman, Dewey, and Hitler. Wallace pointed out that they are adopting the same deceptive policies as the former German "Fuhrer." The purpose of American diplomacy is to hide itself under the cloak of an anti-communist crusade; such crusades have appeared in the world before, and the name of its initiator was Hitler. According to a TASS report, Wallace pointed out in a speech in Seattle on the 8th that the organizers of the "Cold War" are also carrying out a "hot war" against the American people, especially against American trade unions. On the same day, Wallace also sharply criticized Assistant Secretary of State Saltzman's speech on the 7th, which stated that a US-Soviet war was inevitable, pointing out that its intention was to obtain large military expenditures.

　　美知识分子团体举行大会
  　反对美国法西斯化
  　华莱士以希特勒比杜威杜鲁门
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国全国科学、艺术、自由职业者协会，顷在保卫美国学校与研究院的教师与科学家权利的口号下于十月九日至十日在此间举行大会。该会全国十九个分会二百五十名代表出席。大会听取了无数教授因支持华莱士或发表进步言论而遭黜退或受威吓的报告，也听取了许多反对美国法西斯化的演说。哥伦比亚大学教授华特逊指出：有钱有势的财阀们正用空前的经济力量掀起反民主运动，因为他们害怕民主思想在许多国家内迅速生长，特别是为苏联的强大所震惊。华氏继指出：美国目前的情势正与希特勒即将攫取政权前的德国相似，要求美国人民警惕起来，反对法西斯的一切威胁。协会法律委员主席、前司法部副部长罗格在演说中宣称：将在各州成立法律保卫委员会，以保卫因有进步政治意见而遭受打击的人士。大会最后通过决议，要求取消非美活动委员会，痛斥杜鲁门的“忠诚”调查，并敦促教员们与工会及其他进步团体联合起来，向增长中的法西斯威胁作斗争。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】美国进步党总统候选人华莱士在其各州竞选旅行中，继续抨击美国反动的“两党外交政策”。据合众社报导，华莱士九日在华盛顿州大科马城发表演说，将杜鲁门、杜威与希特勒相比。华莱士指出：他们所采取的正是前德国“元首”所采取的欺骗政策。美国外交的目的是把自己隐蔽在反共十字军的外衣下；世界上已经出现过这样的十字军了，它的发动者的名字就叫做希特勒。据塔斯社报导，华莱士八日在西雅图演说时指出：“冷战”的组织者同时也在逾行反对美国人民的“热战”，尤其是对付美国的工会。同日，华莱士又曾在记者招待会上尖锐地批评美助理国务卿萨尔兹曼七日所作美苏战争不可避免的演说，指出其用意在取得大笔军费。
