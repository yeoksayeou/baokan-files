　　Overcoming Corruption and Waste
    Dingtao County Rectifies Village Burdens
    [JiluYu Electric] In order to overcome unreasonable village levies and the corruption of some cadres, the Dingtao County Party Committee decided to make the clearing of village burdens one of the key tasks for August. The effort began with the district cadres themselves. Over the past six months, cadres had borrowed goods from villagers without returning them, damaged items without compensating, borrowed funds from the people, and embezzled fruits of labor. Eating and drinking at the public's expense was even more common, and there were also instances of cadres beating, scolding, and binding villagers and village cadres. For example, a work team from Siyang District stayed in Qizhuang for a month this spring and consumed 80 jin of pork from the village. After the wheat harvest this year, a cadre from Chenji District bound 19 civilian laborers in Huzhuang and Bali Temple during a single requisition of stretcher-bearers. This spring, the Chief of Staff of the Ran＠ District Military Committee destroyed a wine vat in Zhouzhuang's tavern because the service was inadequate. Shao ×× from the Baoning District team used over 20,000 yuan of public grain funds, and Guo ×× sold 30,000 yuan worth of public firewood. When the cleanup began, the method was to combine individual self-awareness with exposure by others in a large meeting, followed by repayment and apologies. For example, Ma Mingzhu from Baoning District admitted his mistake of beating village cadres at a village cadres meeting; Zhang Gaozhong from Siyang District repaid 13,000 yuan for wine and food to Yangzhuang at the meeting and admitted his mistake; Meng Fande, the team leader from Ran＠ District, personally carried grain to more than ten villages, including Sanyi Market, to repay meal debts. After such compensation, it had a great impact on the villages. The villages also began to settle accounts, discovering many problems. For example, in Daxu Village in Chenji District, more than a dozen village cadres and three landlords shared 1.96 hectares of land without bearing any burden, and in Siyang District, 34 village cadres ate village grain in Panlou, and more than 40 people in Shahai Village did not serve in labor duties, which caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Whenever labor was requisitioned, there would be quarrels and fights. In Yuan＠ji in Siyang District, the last autumn's stretcher-bearer grain levy (32 jin per mu) revealed an over-collection of 8,000 jin. After the mass cleanup in each village, most of the unreasonable matters were exposed. Finally, the masses evaluated and handled the cases. Village cadres who had been corrupt not only had to admit their mistakes to the masses but also had to repay the embezzled grain and funds. Those who could not afford to repay were handled at the discretion of the masses. The morale of the masses was unprecedentedly high.

　　克服贪污浪费
    定陶县整顿村负担
    【冀鲁豫电】定陶县委为克服各村支差负担不合理及某些干部贪污腐化现象，特决定清理村负担为八月份重要工作之一。首先是从区干本身开始清理。半年来，干部在村中借物未还损物未赔，借用民款，贪污果实甚多，吃喝等更为普遍，对群众村干的打、骂、捆绑等不良作风也不少。汜阳区某工作组今春在戚庄住一个月，吃该村猪肉八十斤。陈集区某干部今年麦后在胡庄、八里庙催担架一次，捆绑民工十九名。冉＠区武委会事务长今年春在周庄酒店因招待不周，毁坏酒瓮一口。保宁区小组邵××动用公粮款两万余元，郭××变卖公柴三万元等等。开始清理时，首先在大会上采用个人自觉与他人揭发相结合方式，接着进行还帐道歉。如保宁区马明珠在村干会议上承认打村干的错误；汜阳区张高仲在大会上偿还杨庄酒菜钱一万三千元，并承认错误；冉＠区小组长孟繁德亲背粮食到三义集等十余村还饭帐。经过这样赔还后，给了各村很大影响。各村也开始算帐，发现很多毛病，如陈集区大徐庄十几个村干和三家地主共地一顷九十六亩不拿负担，汜阳区在潘楼有三十四个村干吃村粮，沙海村四十余人不支差，群众很不满意，每遇支差都要吵嘴打架。汜阳区袁＠集，去秋一次担架粮（每亩卅二斤）就清理出多敛八千斤。各村经过群众性的清理，不合理的事情大都被揭发出来了。最后由群众评议处理，贪污村干除向群众承认错误外，贪污的粮款赔出来，赔不起的经群众评议，酌情处理。群众情绪空前提高。
