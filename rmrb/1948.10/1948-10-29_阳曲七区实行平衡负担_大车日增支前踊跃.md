[Jinzhong Telegram] After Yangqu Seventh District implemented the work-point and collective labor system, the burden of war support for human and animal power and cart owners was balanced, the number of carts increased daily, and the masses actively supported the front. The district has a total of fourteen administrative villages. Due to the looting by the Yan bandit troops, only thirty-one carts remained in the six villages on the plains. After the task of transporting military grain and equipment was assigned in early September, the county and district authorities believed that carts had a large capacity (one cart with three animals and two people could replace ten animals and ten people) and were fast. These six villages were also close to the county and district, making it convenient to dispatch them. Therefore, more carts were assigned each time. Because the villages had just been liberated, the assignment of duties was extremely chaotic, and most did not accurately record work points, the cart owners were extremely dissatisfied. A cart-owning household in Nanbai Village said, "The democratic government emphasizes fairness and reasonableness in everything, so why is the assignment of duties so unequal?" Some said, "We are not afraid of supporting the front as long as it is fair." An old man in Gaocun who owned a cart even said angrily, "If it weren't for the autumn harvest, I would have smashed it and burned it long ago." Some individuals even deliberately cut the ropes on their carts to avoid duty. Some who had originally planned to repair their carts lost the will to do so upon seeing this situation. After discovering this problem, the county and district immediately investigated the military service burden of the three villages of Gaocun, Nanbai Village, and Beibai Village. These three villages had a total of twenty-five carts, which, calculated at three animals and two people per cart, equaled fifty people and seventy-five animals. In September, they performed a total of one thousand four hundred and thirty-one days of military service, averaging more than eleven work points per laborer. Meanwhile, the seventy-seven unharnessed donkeys and mules in the three villages averaged only five work points of service per laborer in September. District cadres also separately convened meetings of cart owners and the masses in each village to solicit opinions widely. Finally, based on the conditions of the new district, they specifically determined: (1) Settle the military service burden for September. The work points owed by human and animal power would be compensated either with labor or with three jin of millet per work point, providing material subsidies to those who exceeded their quota, and thoroughly investigate undeclared labor and animals. Those found to be hiding resources would be criticized and required to make up the work points in full. (2) In addition to the anti-conscription team leader in each village, a new bookkeeper would be appointed to accurately implement the monthly collective labor system, specifically stipulating that one person equals one point, one donkey equals two points, and one mule equals three points. The total points for each household's human and animal power would be added up, and the total number of military service work points contributed by the entire village for the entire month would be allocated proportionally. Those who were short on work points would compensate those who exceeded their quota either with labor or with millet. (3) To encourage the recovery of carts and further assist support for the front and production, it was stipulated that the human and animal power driving a cart would each be credited with an additional half work point per day. After Gaocun announced this method at the household heads meeting, the masses expressed great satisfaction, and more than twenty families immediately volunteered to jointly restore eleven carts. According to recent statistics, twenty-one new carts have been restored in four villages, playing a significant role in supporting the war and restoring production.

[Another Dispatch] The eight villages in the mountains of the district have two hundred and fifty-eight donkeys and mules, and one hundred and thirty-three cattle. There are no carts in the mountains, but cattle can also carry goods. The district authorities considered cattle to be slow when dispatching duties, so they dispatched more donkeys and mules. In July, each donkey in Shijiazhuang Village worked fourteen days, while cattle worked less than two days. Many donkey owners complained, and failure to resolve this issue would inevitably lead to the selling or neglect of donkeys. After district cadres and donkey and cattle owners in each village jointly studied the matter, they decided that if donkey owners used labor, then one work point of cattle labor would be equal to one work point of donkey labor. If labor was not used, then millet would be used to offset work points. After the burden between cattle and donkeys was balanced, the masses were all satisfied.

　　阳曲七区实行平衡负担
  　大车日增支前踊跃
    【晋中电】阳曲七区实行计工齐工制度后，平衡了人畜力与大车户的战勤负担，大车日增，群众积极支前。该区共十四个行政村，由于阎匪劫掠，平川六村仅剩大车三十一辆，九月初运送军粮器材的任务下达后，县区认为大车容量大（一辆车三个牲口两个人能顶十个牲口十个人）速度快，该六村又临近县区，派要亦方便，因此每次有差多派大车。村里因刚解放，摊派勤务均极混乱，且多未确实执行记工，有车户极为不满。南白村养车户说：“民主政府干什也讲究公平合理，为啥派差就是苦乐不均？”有的说：“咱有车就不怕支差，只是办公平就行。”高村某养车老汉竟气的说：“不是为秋收，早把它砸碎烧啦。”更有个别户故意把车上的绳索割断，借以躲差。有些原计划整修大车的，看到这种情形，也没心意了。县区发现此问题后，当即清查了高村、南白村、北白村三村的军勤负担，该三村共大车二十五辆，按每辆大车三个牲口两个人计，五十个人，七十五个牲口，他们在九月份即服军勤工一千四百三十一个，每个劳力平均十一个工还多；而该三村七十七头不套车的驴骡，九月份每个劳力平均仅服勤五个工。区干部又分头召开了各村养车户与群众会，广泛征求意见，最后根据新区的条件具体确定：（一）清算九月份的军勤负担，人畜力所差之工，或以工还工，或以三斤小米顶一工，给余工者物质补助，彻底清查黑人黑驴。挤出来的除受批评外照数补工。（二）各村除抗勤队长外，新设记帐员确实执行每月齐工制度，具体规定人顶一分，驴顶二分，骡顶三分，将各户人畜力总分加起来，以全村全月所出军勤工的总数按分摊工，短工者或以工或以米补偿长工者。（三）为奖励恢复大车，更有助于支前和生产，规定赶大车的人畜力每走一天各多计半个工。高村将此办法在户主大会上宣布后，群众极表满意，当场即有二十多家自报合伙恢复大车十一辆。据最近统计，四个村已新恢复大车二十一辆，对支援战争恢复生产起很大作用。
    【又讯】该区山上八村有驴骡二百五十八头，牛一百三十三头，山上无车，牛亦能驮运，区里派差时嫌牛走的慢，故多派驴骡。石家庄村七月份每个毛驴出工十四个，而牛还不足两个工。喂驴户多有怨言，不解决势必引起卖驴乏驴现象。区干部和各村养驴喂牛户共同研究后，决定喂驴户如用工，则以牛工一工还一工，不用工则以米顶工。牛驴之间负担量平衡以后，群众都满意。
