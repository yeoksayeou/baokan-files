　　Coordinating with the Ping-Sui Railway Offensive
  　We Recapture Gu'an and Xushui
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pingbao Front, 14th] To coordinate with the offensive of the People's Liberation Army on the Ping-Sui Railway, a unit of the North China People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the Ping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle area at the beginning of this month. On the 6th and 9th, they successively recovered Gu'an City, 120 li south of Beiping, and Xushui City and Gu'an Town on the Ping-Han Railway. The enemy bandit Wang Fenggang's bandit troops and the 94th Army, who were guarding the three places, abandoned the cities and fled. Prior to this, the People's Liberation Army had won a victory in the southeast of Xincheng on the 3rd, annihilating more than 2,000 of Wang Fenggang's bandit main force. At present, north of the Daqing River and south of the Yongding River in the Ping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle area, except for a few isolated strongholds such as Shengfang and Xincheng, the vast area including the county towns of Gu'an, Baxian, Yongqing, Rongcheng, and Xiongxian, are all under the control of the People's Liberation Army.
    [Jizhong Telegram] After our army annihilated more than 2,000 of the main force of the Wang Fenggang bandits, east and north of the Daqing River, and south of the Yongding River, except for a few isolated strongholds such as Xincheng and Shengfang, the vast area including Baxian, Xiongxian, Yongqing, Rongcheng, and Gu'an, has been largely controlled by us. Under this favorable situation, in order to vigorously carry out work in the newly recovered areas, the Tenth Prefectural Committee of the CPC Jizhong Committee has issued instructions, calling on the Party, government, army, and people in the area to concentrate all their strength to restore the area and carry out work. The military region and local work closely cooperate, continue to fight, search for and eliminate the remaining enemies, vigorously launch a political offensive, widely publicize the victorious situation of our army, and publicize the various policies of our party. Organize the masses in the marginal areas to fight against grain robbery and conscription. Call on the masses to carry out autumn plowing and production, vigorously eliminate counterfeit currency, and stabilize social order. And organize and unite the majority of the masses to jointly confront the enemy.
