　　Actively Develop Private Lending in Rural Areas

　　After rent reduction and interest rate reduction and land reform in the North China Liberated Area, the old feudal usurious lending relationships were eliminated, but new lending relationships have not developed normally. According to incomplete materials from various places, there are currently four types of private lending in rural areas: (1) Borrowing money and repaying money. For example, Wu Huicheng from the Fifth District of Shijiazhuang City borrowed 600,000 Border Region Currency from his daughter's family this spring to buy a mule. Feng Bingshun from Liujiazhuang, Anguo County, Hebei Province, borrowed tens of thousands of yuan from Liu Wenkui. Liu said, "We have to make it clear that it can't be for long, at most five days, at least three days, otherwise, what will happen if prices rise!" (2) Borrowing grain and repaying grain without interest. For example, Li Pu from Wanzicun, Jianping County, North Yue, borrowed one stone of corn from Shuang Deyu the spring before last because he had no grain to eat, and returned it in the fall. They are relatives, so there is no interest. Guo Xixiang from Nanguan, Pingshan County, borrowed one斗 of wheat from Wang Wende this spring because he had nothing to eat, with no set time for repayment. (3) Borrowing grain and repaying grain with interest. For example, Hao Shizhen from Wanzicun, Jianping County, borrowed 2.2斗 of corn from Suozhu last spring because he had nothing to eat, and repaid 2斗 of wheat in the summer, calculated according to the price of corn and wheat after the wheat harvest, about 3% monthly interest. Lü Shuanglian from Taoyuan Village, Fifth District, Shijiazhuang City, borrowed 200斤 of wheat from Zhang Yishi this spring to buy a mule, and repaid it after the wheat harvest, with a monthly interest of 8斤 of wheat, equivalent to 4% monthly interest. (4) Borrowing money and converting it to grain. Wu Mengyun from Wujiazhuang, Shijiazhuang City, borrowed 3 million Border Region Currency from Jiemen Village this spring to buy a waterwheel, converted into wheat to be repaid after the wheat harvest, with a term of two months. When borrowing, the market price of wheat was 50,000 yuan per斗, but it was converted at 48,000 yuan. Its interest is disguised. If calculated at 50,000 yuan, 3 million yuan is equivalent to 6 stone of wheat. Calculated at 48,000 yuan, it is equivalent to 6.25 stone of wheat. That is to say, borrowing 6 stone of wheat for two months has an interest of 0.25 stone, equivalent to 2% monthly interest. In Liujiazhuang, Anguo County, influenced by the bank's real-value loan, a portion of the fruit of struggle money of the village's poor peasant group was not distributed. In order to support mass production, the money was converted into millet and lent to the masses to buy livestock (five were bought), and the money was repaid in kind when dividing the floating wealth. In addition to borrowing between the masses, some people also borrow money and grain from credit cooperatives and cooperatives.

　　Based on the above materials, rural private lending relationships have the following characteristics: (1) The scope of lending is very small, limited to relatives and friends with good feelings. Due to the small lending circle, many farmers feel that there is no way to borrow money. Some people in Anguo said: "It's a dead world. No one dares to lend a little grain even if you say you'll pay interest." (2) There is more lending of goods and less lending of money. The term for lending goods is generally one or two seasons, that is, borrowing in spring and repaying in summer, and borrowing in spring and repaying in autumn. The term for lending money is very short, three, five, or eight to ten days. This is a manifestation of farmers' desire to preserve their capital in times of war and rising prices. (3) Some lending has no interest, and if there is interest, it is secret, especially fearing that cadres will know. The form of interest is mostly hidden and diverse, such as borrowing coarse grains and repaying fine grains. Due to the short term and small amount of money lending, there is generally no interest. In lending of goods, there is no interest between those who are deeply friendly, and there is interest in general cases. (4) The amount of grain borrowed is small, generally 2-3斗 of goods.

　　Why haven't rural private lending relationships developed universally, openly, and extensively, but instead have produced a narrow, small-scale, short-term, secret, and abnormal lending relationship? The main reasons are the ideological concerns of the masses, our lack of attention to this work over a long period of time, and deviations in the ideological understanding of cadres. According to our understanding, the concerns of the masses on the issue of lending are:

　　(1) Fear of being labeled as usurious exploitation. During the Anti-Japanese War, the policy of dividing halves and reducing interest was implemented, and the feudal exploitation of landlords' usury was liquidated during the land reform. After the land reform, the government did not announce new lending laws, so many people mistakenly believed that "lending money for interest is usury" and "illegal." Therefore, many people dare not lend money for fear of being struggled against, and a few who lend money with interest must keep it secret, especially afraid of cadres knowing.

　　(2) Fear of being labeled as rich. Due to the wrong struggles against middle peasants and other leftist errors during the land reform, a misconception was created in the minds of the masses, mistakenly believing that "whoever is rich will be struggled against." Therefore, many people are unwilling to lend money, fearing that others will know that they have money.

　　(3) Fear of debt cancellation. In some areas, the general propaganda of debt cancellation during the land reform has had a significant impact on private lending.

　　Cadres' ideological understanding of this issue is biased. Some people believe that "farmers are poor, and there is no idle capital in rural areas" and "rural lending relationships have completely stopped," which is not in line with the actual situation. The above materials clearly tell us that there are many people in rural areas who are willing to take out two or three斗 of grain to lend to others to expand production and regulate life; at the same time, there are also many people who urgently need new lending relationships to help them in times of need for production and life, but the scope of lending is very small. In the past, we did not have sufficient understanding of this actual situation, and we did not explicitly protect and promote free private lending after abolishing usury, which is the reason why private lending has not developed. In addition, the excessively low interest rates on bank loans in the past have also affected the development of private lending.

　　At present, there is a lack of agricultural production funds, and there are two ways to solve it: relying on banks to issue agricultural loans and farmers lending each other to adjust. It must be recognized that the masses' funds are much larger than bank loans. Relying solely on bank loans cannot completely solve the problem of farmers' production funds. We must seriously develop private lending. This is the basic direction of our rural financial work in the future, and we should pay enough attention to it.

　　Based on the analysis of the above situation, in order to develop private lending in the future, we believe that the following work needs to be carried out:

　　First, clear up the ideological concerns of the masses and cadres. The government should issue a notice, explicitly announcing the protection of private lending after the abolition of usury, and the lending interest rate should be freely agreed upon by both parties. This new creditor's right, regardless of its class affiliation, will be recognized by law and will no longer be abolished. Cadres should widely publicize the government's policy on private lending to the masses to dispel their ideological concerns.

　　In the minds of the masses and cadres, it must be clear what feudal usury is and why we oppose it? What is the new lending relationship—New Democratic lending, and why should it be protected? We believe that the most important difference between the two lies in: usury destroys production, while New Democratic lending supports production. In feudal society, farmers were oppressed and exploited by landlords and lived in poverty. They generally borrowed money not to invest in production, but often due to the pressure of life, such as natural disasters, deaths, taxes, etc. They borrowed at high interest rates, and the interest had to be paid from agricultural income. Once they were unable to repay the principal and interest, the land and houses were taken away by the creditors. As a result, farmers lost the necessary means of production and livelihood, their enthusiasm for production was reduced, they could not expand reproduction at all, and agricultural production was increasingly萎缩. In a New Democratic society, especially after the land reform, farmers have obtained the basic means of production—land and houses—and the minimum means of livelihood. Farmers' enthusiasm for production has increased. They borrow money mainly for production and allocate a portion of the production profit—that is, interest—to the creditors, so that both the borrower and the lender benefit. In this way, the development of new lending relationships will help to continue to improve and develop productivity. Secondly, on the issue of interest rates, usury interest rates are high, generally exceeding 2-3% per month, especially when farmers are more impoverished and more urgently need to borrow money, the interest rates are heavier. Borrowing grain can have a monthly interest rate of 10%. In short, the interest rate of feudal usury exceeds the profit of the production undertaking, while the interest rate of New Democratic lending does not exceed the production profit.

　　Second, clarify the interest rate policy. What is the specific standard for interest rates in the new rural lending in the future? Due to the current lack of development of lending relationships, the difficulty in calculating agricultural profits, and the lack of investigation materials, we will not set specific standards for the time being. We will decide after private lending is widely developed, based on production profits and general interest rate conditions. Setting specific standards for private lending interest rates too early will affect the development of private lending. Therefore, our current policy on private lending interest rates should be that both borrowers and lenders should freely and voluntarily agree on it under the principles of "developing production" and "both labor and capital benefit."

　　Third, what methods should be adopted to develop private lending? In addition to widely developing lending among the masses, we mainly organize mass credit cooperatives (including people of all classes) and use them to absorb idle materials in rural areas and then lend them out.

　　The basic key to organizing rural credit cooperatives is to correctly implement the policy of "developing production" and "both labor and capital benefit." However, special attention should be paid to ensuring that deposits can be guaranteed and profitable. In the past, some credit cooperatives collapsed because the masses requested to withdraw deposits or withdraw shares. The main reason was that during the war, prices rose, and the interest rate on loans was low, and deposits and shares could not be guaranteed and lost money when calculated at prices. All localities should pay attention to this issue in the future.

　　积极开展农村私人借贷
    华北解放区经过减租减息与土地改革，旧的封建高利贷剥削借贷关系被消灭，新的借贷关系，却未正常地发展起来。根据各地不完全材料来看，目前农村私人借贷形式有四种：（一）借款还款。如石家庄市五区吴会成今春买骡子一头，在他闺女家借边币六十万元。冀中安国县刘家庄冯丙顺借刘文奎几万元，刘说：“咱们说下可不能长了，多则五天少则三天，要不，物价一涨可怎样还呀！”（二）借粮还粮没利息。如北岳建屏县湾子村李朴，前年春天没粮吃，借双德玉茭一石，秋后归还，他们是亲戚关系无利息。平山县南关郭希祥，今春没吃的，借王文得麦子一斗，啥时有啥时还没规定期限。（三）借粮还粮有利息。如建屏县湾子村郝世贞，去年春天没吃的，借锁珠玉茭二斗二升，夏季还麦子二斗，按麦收后玉茭与麦子价格计算，大约月利三分。石家庄五区桃园村吕双连，今春买骡子借张一世麦子二百斤，麦收后归还，每月利息麦子八斤，合月利四分。（四）借款折粮。石家庄市吴家庄吴梦云今春买水车，在介门村借边币三百万元，折成麦子麦后归还，期限两个月。借款时麦子市价五万元一斗，却以四万八千元折合，它的利息是变相的。若以五万元计算，三百万元折麦子六石，按四万八千元算，折麦子六石二斗五升，这就是说借六石麦子二个月息二斗五升，合月利二分。安国县刘家庄，受银行贷款折实影响，该村贫农团有一部分斗争果实款未分下去，为了扶助群众生产，将款折成小米借给群众买牲口（买了五个），分浮财时按实物归还。除群众互相间借贷外，群众在信用社合作社借款借粮的也有一些。
    根据上述材料看来，农村私人借贷关系，有如下特点：（一）借贷范围很小，只限于感情很好的亲戚乡友之间。由于借贷圈子小，许多农民感到借贷无门，安国有些群众说：“成死世界了，借点粮食，说给利息都无人敢借。”（二）实物借贷多，货币借贷少，实物借贷期限一般是一季和二季即春借夏还和春借秋还，货币借贷期限很短，都是三天、五天或十天八天。这是战争时期，物价上涨情况下，农民要求保本思想之表现。（三）借贷利息部分的没有，有利息也是秘密的，特别害怕干部知道。利息形式是隐蔽的多样的，如借粗粮还细粮。货币借贷因期限很短，数额较小，一般无利息。实物借贷中，凡双方情深谊厚的无利息，一般的有利息。（四）借粮数额小，一般是实物二三斗。
    农村私人借贷关系，为何没有普遍地、公开地、大量地开展起来，却产生一种狭隘的、小额的、短期的、秘密的、不正常的借贷关系呢？推其原因，主要是群众思想顾虑问题，和我们长时期内对此工作不够重视，干部思想认识有偏差。据我们了解，群众在借贷问题上的顾虑是：
    （一）怕落高利贷剥削罪名。抗战时期实行分半减息，土改中对地主高利贷的封建剥削曾经进行清算。土改后政府未公布新的借贷法令，于是不少群众误认为：“放帐得利钱就是高利贷”，就是“违法”。因此许多人不敢放帐怕挨斗争，少数放帐有利息的，要保守秘密，特别怕干部知道。
    （二）怕落有钱之名。土改中因错斗中农及其他左倾错误，在群众思想中造成一种错觉，误认为：“谁有钱就斗谁”，于是许多人不愿放帐，怕别人知道自己有钱。
    （三）怕废债。有些地区土改中一般的宣传废债，对私人借贷影响不小。
    干部思想上，对此问题认识有偏差。有些人认为：“农民贫困，农村没有游资。”“农村借贷关系完全停顿”，这都不合乎实际情况。上述材料明确告诉我们，农村中有不少人愿意拿出二三斗粮食，借给别人扩大生产，调剂生活；同时也有不少人为了生产与生活需要，迫切要求新的借贷关系予以济急，不过借贷范围很小而已。我们过去对此种实际情况认识不足，没有在废除高利贷之后，明令保护及提倡私人自由借贷，这是造成私人借贷不开展的原因。此外过去银行贷款利息过低，对私人借贷之开展，亦有影响。
    目前农业生产资金缺乏，解决的办法有二：即靠银行发放农贷和农民借贷互相调剂。必须认识群众资金比银行贷款大得多，只靠银行贷款，绝不能完全解决农民生产资金问题，我们必须认真去开展私人借贷。这是今后我们农村金融工作的基本方向，应加以足够的注意。
    根据上述情况的分析，为了开展今后私人借贷，我们认为需要进行下列工作：
    第一、打通群众和干部的思想顾虑。政府发布告，明令宣布保护废除高利贷以后的私人借贷，借贷利息由借贷双方自由议定，此项新的债权，不问其所属阶级如何，一律受到法律承认，不再废除。干部要向群众广泛宣传政府对私人借贷的政策，解除群众思想顾虑。
    群众和干部思想中，必须明确什么是封建性的高利贷，我们为什么反对？什么是新的借贷关系——新民主主义的借贷，为什么要保护。我们认为二者最主要的区别在于：高利贷是破坏生产的，新民主主义借贷是扶助生产的。在封建社会里，农民受地主压迫剥削，生活贫困，他们借债一般不是投资生产，往往由于生活所迫，如天灾、死亡、租税等，高利求借，利息要从农业收入中支付，一旦无力偿还本利时，土地房屋即被债主夺去，结果农民失掉必要的生产资料与生活资料，生产情绪降低，根本不能扩大再生产，并使农业生产日益萎缩。在新民主主义社会里，特别是土改后，农民获得基本的生产资料——土地房屋，与起码的生活资料，农民生产情绪提高，他们借债主要用于生产，从生产利润中，分出一部分——即利息给债主，做到借贷双方有利。这样新的借贷关系之发展，就有助于生产力之继续提高与发展。其次在利息问题上，高利贷利息大，一般超过月利二三分，特别在农民愈贫困，借债愈迫切时，利息就愈重，借粮食有月利十分的。总之封建性的高利贷，利息超过生产事业利润，新民主主义借贷，利息不超过生产利润。
    第二、明确利息政策，关于今后农村新的借贷中，利息的具体标准，究竟如何订定？由于目前借贷关系不开展，农业利润计算困难和调查材料之不足，我们暂不规定具体标准。等待私人借贷普遍开展后，再根据生产利润和一般利息情况决定之。若过早规定私人借贷利息的具体标准，将会影响私人借贷的开展。因之目前我们对私人借贷利息的政策，应当是在“发展生产”，“劳资两利”的原则下，让借贷双方自由自愿议定之。
    第三、采取什么方式开展私人借贷呢？我们除广泛开展群众互相间的借贷外，主要是组织群众性（包括各阶层人民）的信用合作社，通过它来吸收农村的闲散物资再贷出去。
    组织农村信用合作社的基本关键，是正确执行“发展生产”，“劳资两利”方针。但要特别注意使存款能保本并且有利。过去有些信用社，群众要求提取存款或抽股金而垮台，其原因主要是由于战争时期，物价上涨，对放款利息低，存款和股金按物价计算不能保本，而且赔钱所致，今后各地应注意这一问题。
