　　*Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Masses Daily* Editorial Calls For Strengthening Party Education in Rural Areas

The rural Chinese Communist Party branches in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the majority of which have a long history and rich experience, have played a significant role in the Liberation War, supporting the front lines, land reform, and production movements. However, due to the long-term neglect of rural branch work by certain leading organs, especially the long-term neglect or even abandonment of ideological education for rural Party members in practical work, many rural Party members still have a vague understanding of the Party's basic program, policies, organization, and discipline. Some have even developed selfish and self-seeking ideas and coercive commanding styles, engaging in corruption and oppressing the masses. This phenomenon has seriously hindered the Party's leading role in various rural tasks in some areas, the connection between the Party and the masses, and has damaged the Party's credibility among the broad masses of peasants. *Border Region Masses Daily* published an editorial entitled "Strengthening Party Education in Rural Areas," pointing out that strengthening Party education in rural areas is the main content of building the Party in the rural areas of the Border Region and is the key to improving all rural work. On the basis of the current rectification and development of the Party, strict organizational life should be enforced and education on the Party's basic knowledge for Party members should be strengthened.

The editorial stated: "Peasant Party members generally join the Party not because of communist awareness. If they do not receive the necessary ideological education and strict organizational life training after joining the Party, they cannot become proletarian vanguards, and they cannot lead the peasant masses from scattered individual producers to the path of cooperation in the new democratic agricultural production." The editorial pointed out that in the current situation of intense revolutionary struggle and arduous revolutionary tasks, it is especially necessary to educate peasant Party members. The primary task of the Party's leading organs is not to blame the backwardness and selfishness of peasant Party members, but to examine their own non-Marxist-Leninist erroneous tendencies of neglecting rural branch work and lacking or even abandoning intra-Party education.

The editorial requires Party organizations in various regions to conduct education based on the "Party Member Textbook" and with reference to the situation of branch members. The editorial also stated: According to the current political experience and cultural level of cadres in the Border Region, the county party committee should become the main responsible organ for leading, organizing and planning party member education. All localities should resolutely implement the regulations of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC: When Party member cadres go to work in the countryside, they must establish contact with the branch, listen to the opinions of Party members, and explain issues to Party members. The county party committee should effectively organize this work. Only by establishing this system of "all party member cadres are teachers" can education not be lacking, and the realization of the education plan be guaranteed. Every party member cadre must recognize that this work of educating comrades is their duty; party committees at all levels should also regard this work as one of the important contents of inspecting the work of party member cadres, and assign special personnel to be responsible for it. Only in this way can the regular education work of the rural Party be established, rural Party members will continue to improve, and all rural work will be done well.

### 陕甘宁边区群众日报社论号召  加强农村党的教育

　　陕甘宁边区群众日报社论号召
    加强农村党的教育
    【新华社西北廿八日电】陕甘宁边区的农村中共支部，大多数具有长久历史和丰富经验，在解放战争、支援前线、土地改革及生产运动中，都起了很大的作用。但由于某些领导机关长期忽视农村支部工作，尤其是长期忽视甚至放弃在实际工作中对农村党员的思想教育，以致不少农村党员对党的基本纲领、政策、组织及纪律的了解还很模糊，其中一部分且发展了自私自利思想和强迫命令作风，贪污腐化，欺压群众。这种现象已严重地妨碍了某些地区党在农村各项工作中的领导作用，党与群众的联系，并有损党在广大农民中的信仰。边区群众日报特以“加强农村党的教育”为题发表社论，指出加强农村党的教育，是边区建设农村党的主要内容，是改进农村一切工作的关键，应在目前整顿与发展党的基础上，严格组织生活，加强党员关于党的基本知识的教育。
    社论称：“农民党员入党一般不是由于共产主义的觉悟，如果在入党以后得不到必需的思想教育和严格的组织生活的锻炼，就不可能成为无产阶级的先锋战士，就不可能率领农民群众在新民主主义农业生产中由分散的个体生产者进到合作化的道路。”社论指出，在目前革命斗争激烈进行和革命任务繁重的情况之下，对于农民党员进行教育尤为必要。党的领导机关的首要任务，不是责备农民党员的落后与自私，而是检讨自己忽视农村支部工作、缺乏以至放弃党内教育的非马列主义的错误倾向。
    社论要求各地党的组织根据“党员课本”并参照支部党员情况来进行教育。社论并称：按照目前边区干部的政治经验和文化水平，县委应成为领导组织与计划党员教育的主要负责机关。各地应坚决执行中共西北局的规定：党员干部下乡工作，必须与支部发生联系，倾听党员意见，给党员讲解问题。县委应切实组织这一工作。只有建立这种“党员干部皆教员”的制度，教育才不致缺乏，教育计划的实现才有保障，每个党员干部必须认识这种教育同志的工作，是自己应尽的职责；各级党委亦应将此项工作作为检查党员干部工作的重要内容之一，并指定专人负责。只有这样，农村党经常的教育工作才能建立，农村党员才会不断提高，农村的一切工作也才会做好。
