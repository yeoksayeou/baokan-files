　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th—Fengzhen City, a commercial center in eastern Sui, which has just been liberated from the tyrannical rule of the bandit Fu Zuoyi, is working with all its citizens to fully restore various undertakings under the leadership of the democratic government, especially the rapid restoration of education. The city originally had the Suiyuan Provincial Normal School, Fengzhen Middle School, and sixteen higher and primary elementary schools, all of which have resumed classes one after another, and all original faculty and staff have also returned to their posts. In order to help solve the current difficulties in education, the democratic government has temporarily issued each school office expenses ranging from 600,000 to 2,000,000 agricultural currency units, and each faculty and staff member is issued 50 to 60 catties of millet. The educational circles in Fengzhen, who have suffered greatly from the persecution of the Fu bandits, have recently accused Fu's bandits of various crimes in destroying education. They said: When Fu's bandits occupied Fengzhen in September 1946, Ma Yutang, the Hui principal of the No. 1 Complete Primary School, and Chen Lin, the director of teaching at the No. 4 Complete Primary School, were both arrested. In March of this year, the People's Liberation Army once recovered Fengzhen and withdrew not long after. Fu's bandits then massacred more than 200 citizens, including educators such as Bai Xianmin. In order to maintain its tyrannical rule, Fu's bandits even implemented a special agent Baojia system in schools, with a class as a "Bao" and the entire school as a "Xiang," with bandit party and youth league members serving as "Xiang Chief" and "Bao Chief" to monitor student actions. What was instilled in students on weekdays was treasonous education, with content such as "America is absolutely democratic" and "China is America's best market," completely devoid of national shame. A joint responsibility system was implemented for faculty and staff, and they were forced to undergo training during holidays, subjecting them to torture. Before this liberation, the living conditions of faculty and staff had reached the extreme. Each month, they could only extract 110 catties of black flour mixed with sand from the "Xingfeng Flour Company" run by Fu's bandits to barely make ends meet. From June of this year, even the black flour was not provided, and they could only survive on wheat bran. Having suffered countless hardships, they all feel like they have seen the light of day after this liberation.
    
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th—Since the liberation of Jinan, many factories in Weifang City have expanded their operations one after another. Some industrialists and businessmen who were previously concerned about the current situation have also settled down and invested in production. Zhu Zicheng, the manager of the Hongwen Bookstore in Dongguan City, recently raised 16 million yuan to open the Hengfeng Iron Factory. Tan Boqin, a shareholder of the original Hongda Electrical Materials Factory, had buried a batch of wires underground when the Kuomintang ruled Weifang. He has now taken them out and sold them to open the Tiansheng Weaving Factory with his own funds. A businessman from the Tianxingcheng Clothing Store in the urban area sold 90 bundles of foreign yarn in the early days of the liberation of Weifang and exchanged them for gold ingots, planning to go to Qingdao. Later, influenced by the democratic government's policy of protecting industry and commerce, he did not go for the time being but still held a wait-and-see attitude. Now, he has purchased five weaving machines and one tablecloth machine to open a weaving factory. In addition, several iron factories and sand casting factories have also added workers and expanded production. The number of factories applying for loans from the North Sea Bank is also increasing. Fourteen factories in the weaving and iron industries, among others, have been approved for loans totaling more than 30 million yuan.

　　在民主政府帮助下
  　丰镇学校已全复课
  　潍坊工商业者扩大经营
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】刚从傅作义匪帮暴政统治下解放出来绥东商业中心的丰镇市，民主政府正协同市民全力进行各项恢复工作，教育事业的恢复尤为迅速。该市原有绥远省立师范、丰镇中学及高、初小学十六座，均已先后复课，原有教职员亦全部复职。民主政府为帮助解决目前教育工作中的困难，已暂发各校办公费农币六十万元至二百万元，每个教职员则发五十至六十斤小米。备受傅匪迫害的丰镇教育界人士，顷纷纷控诉傅匪摧残教育的种种罪行。他们说：一九四六年九月傅匪侵占丰镇时，该市第一完小回民校长马玉堂及第四完小教导主任陈琳均被逮捕。今年三月，解放军曾一度收复丰镇，不久撤出，傅匪又屠杀市民二百余人，其中包括教育工作者白宪民等在内。傅匪为维持其暴政统治，甚至在学校内亦实行特务保甲制度，一班为“保”，全校为“乡”，由匪党、团员担任“乡长”、“保长”，借以监视学生行动。平日对学生所灌输的是卖国教育，内容如“美国绝对民主”、“中国是美国最好的市场”等等，丧尽民族廉耻。对教职员则实行连坐法，并强迫假期受训，加以折磨。在这次解放前，教职员生活困苦已达极点，每月仅从傅匪所办“兴丰面粉公司”提取一百十斤掺沙黑面，勉强糊口，今年六月份起则连黑面也不给了，只能以麦麸度日，由于身受无数痛苦，此次解放后，他们都有重见天日之感。
    【新华社华东二十八日电】济南解放后，潍坊市许多工厂，纷纷扩大经营。某些过去对时局尚有顾虑的工商业者，也安心放手投资生产。该市东关宏文书店经理朱子成最近已集股一千六百余万开设恒丰铁工厂。原宏达电料厂股东谭伯禽，在国民党统治潍市时，曾将一批电线埋藏地下，现已取出变卖，独资开设天盛织布厂。城区天兴成服装店某商，于潍市解放初期曾将九十捆洋纱出售，换成金宝，拟赴青岛，后受民主政府保护工商业政策的影响，暂未成行，但仍抱观望态度，现在则购买织布机五架，织台布机一架，开设织布厂。此外尚有数家铁工厂及翻砂厂也增添工人，扩大生产。向北海银行要求贷款的工厂也日益增多，已审核贷予者有织布、铁工等业十四厂，共三千余万元。
