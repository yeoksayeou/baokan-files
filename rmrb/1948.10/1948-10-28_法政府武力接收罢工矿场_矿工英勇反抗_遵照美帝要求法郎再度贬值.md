Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—Reports from various sources indicate that French striking miners are heroically resisting the armed suppression by the Queuille government. The Queuille government dispatched large numbers of army troops, Republican "Security Forces," and Gendarmerie police, and since the 18th has been forcibly taking over mines in several striking coal mining areas, provoking resistance from the miners. The main areas of conflict are in Saint-Étienne and other places in central France. Despite fierce attacks by the military police, the major mines were still in the hands of the miners as of the 20th. Some mines changed hands several times. When government troops attacked the miners there, workers from other industries nearby immediately rose up in support and counterattacked against the government troops. *L'Humanité* reported that the miners in these areas, who had shown particular heroism in the struggle against the German invaders, are now preparing to repel the invaders. The National Federation of Miners issued a public statement, paying tribute to the glorious unity and fighting spirit of the workers. The statement pointed out that neither violence, terror, nor deception can force the miners to submit. Railway transport workers in central France held a sympathy strike for several hours on the 20th. The railway union called on railway workers in the Mediterranean region to strike in support of the demand for a minimum monthly wage of 15,000 francs.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th—Reports from various sources indicate that amidst soaring prices and surging labor unrest, the French Queuille government, at the behest of its U.S. masters, announced on the 15th its third devaluation of the franc since the war, implementing a so-called "currency adjustment." It stipulated that import and export exchange rates will henceforth be paid according to the average value of the official rate (originally 214 francs to the U.S. dollar) and the free market rate (currently 314 francs to the U.S. dollar), and will be adjusted once a month. According to the above method, the foreign exchange price of the franc has been devalued by 22 percent since the 16th of this month, i.e., 264 francs to the U.S. dollar. This method will make the French people pay more money for imported goods and "benefit the large American capital groups that are now preparing to invest in France under the Marshall Plan." French political figures do not hide the fact that this devaluation was decided by the International Monetary Fund in Washington (Agence France-Presse).

Prior to the devaluation, the amount of francs in circulation had reached a record high of 923.6 billion. After this devaluation, the purchasing power of 10,000 francs is now only equivalent to 4,500 francs before the price reduction in January (when it was 119 francs to the U.S. dollar). As for the black market price, United Press reported that it had already reached 458 francs to the U.S. dollar earlier this month.

The franc devaluation has brought about a new surge in prices. Agence France-Presse reported that the French government announced on the 18th that it would increase the price of household coal by 35 percent; sugar, 50 percent; soap, 80 percent; and oil, 110 percent. The French Communist Party's newspaper, *L'Humanité*, stated that nothing could more clearly demonstrate that the French government is a servant of American monopoly capitalists than the devaluation of the franc during the miners' strike. French coal costs 3,500 francs per ton, and after this devaluation of the franc, imported American coal will cost 5,500 francs per ton.

　　法政府武力接收罢工矿场
  　矿工英勇反抗
  　遵照美帝要求法郎再度贬值
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导，法国罢工矿工英勇抗击葛义政府的武力镇压。葛义政府派出大批陆军、共和国“保安队”及宪兵警察，从十八日起即在正在罢工的若干煤矿区进行武力接收矿场，引起矿工的反抗。冲突地点主要在法国中部圣德田等地，尽管军警猛烈攻击，但各主要矿场迄二十日仍在矿工手中。有些矿场曾数度易手。当政府军队向那里矿工进攻，附近其他各业工人立即起来声援反击政府军。人道报称：这些地区的矿工，曾经在反对德国侵略者的斗争中，表现特别英勇，现在正准备击退进犯者。矿工全国联合会发表公报，对工友们的辉煌团结与战斗精神致敬。公报指出，不论是暴力、恐怖、欺骗，都不能够迫使矿工屈服。法中部铁路运输工人二十日举行同情罢工数小时。铁路工会号召地中海方面铁路工人罢工，以支持每月获得最低工资一万五千法郎的要求。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方报导：法葛义政府在物价狂涨工潮澎湃声中，依照其美国主子的要求，于十五日宣布其战后第三次的法郎贬值，实行所谓“货币调整”，规定今后进出口汇价按照官价（原为二一四法郎换一美元）与自由市场汇率（目前为三一四法郎换一美元）之平均值支付，并每月调整一次。按照上项办法，本月法郎外汇价格已于十六日起贬值百分之二十二，即为二六四法郎换一美元。这种办法将使法国人民为入口货付出更多的钱，而“有利于现在正准备根据马歇尔计划在法国投资的美国大资本集团”。法政界人士并不隐讳这次贬值是由华盛顿的国际货币基金会所决定的（电通社）。
    贬值前法郎发行额已达九千二百三十六亿的最高纪录，经过此次贬值，一万法郎的购买力，已只抵一月间贬价以前（当时为一一九法郎换一美元）的四千五百法郎。至于黑市价格，据合众社称，早在本月初即已达四五八法郎换一美元。
    法郎贬值带来了物价新高涨。电通社消息称，法政府已于十八日宣布将家庭用煤加价百分之三十五；糖，百分之五十；肥皂，百分之八十；油类，百分之一百一十。法共机关报人道报称：没有任何东西能比在矿工罢工期间实行法郎贬值一事更清楚地说明法国政府之为美国独占资本家的奴仆了。法国煤每吨为三千五百法郎，在这次法郎贬值以后，入口美煤每吨价值将达五千五百法郎。
