[North Yue Telegram] The North Yue Administrative Office issued specific instructions on September 29 regarding the work of issuing land and property ownership certificates, stating: (1) It is necessary to widely and deeply publicize to the masses that the issuance of ownership certificates is the final confirmation of land rights, housing rights, and property rights. Those who obtain ownership certificates, regardless of their class composition before the land reform, will be fully protected by the government in their freedom to cultivate, reside, mortgage, transfer, gift, and lease under certain conditions. No one shall infringe upon these rights. We call on the masses to strive for production, wealth, and prosperity. (2) Issuing ownership certificates is a new and complex task. Prior to this, a thorough plan must be made based on the different work foundations and cadre strength in various places. Then, under the leadership and assistance of governments and cadres at the special district, county, district, and village levels, issuance should be carried out prudently, step by step, and with focus. Each special district and county should select dedicated personnel combined with district cadres or work teams to choose one or several key villages to gain experience for promotion. Before issuance, the land distribution situation in the village should be reviewed first, and farmers' opinions on land distribution should be solicited. It should be anticipated that many disputes will inevitably be encountered when issuing ownership certificates, such as issues of land boundaries, unregistered land, deficient land, and trees. Farmers should be educated to resolve disputes through consultation in a spirit of unity and mutual concession, and to combine this with resolving issues left over from the land reform. (3) When filling out ownership certificates, work should be carried out with a meticulous, prudent, and responsible attitude. In order to complete the work quickly, the village can select several literate people to fill them out uniformly. When writing, Chinese characters must be written in regular script with a brush, and must not be scribbled. All numbers used in the form must be written in uppercase Chinese numerals. All items listed in the form, such as the number of land and houses, boundaries, size in feet and inches, buildings, trees, waterways, etc., should be filled out in detail, especially those that are prone to disputes, and should be filled out clearly. A draft should first be filled out by household, checked by fair and knowledgeable people elected by the village, and announced at a general meeting. After discussion by the masses and confirmation that there are no errors, it can be copied onto the ownership certificate, then checked again and reported to the county for review, stamped, and distributed to each household. (4) For those second-rate individuals and opium addicts who are recognized by public discussion and are difficult to transform for the time being, in order to urge them to produce, the land and property distributed to them should be announced as having only usage rights. Ownership certificates will be issued to them after they work hard to produce and mend their ways. The ownership certificates they should receive should also be filled out according to the format and temporarily kept by the village office. The land of fugitive households must first be registered and managed by the village office on their behalf. Ownership certificates will be issued to them after they return. (5) The public wasteland, school land, military land, temples, trees, and public buildings owned by the village should also be filled out on ownership certificates and handed over to the village office for safekeeping.
