　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS reports: Workers in all industries and regions throughout the Soviet Union are enthusiastically participating in a wave to reduce production costs and increase profits, thereby increasing socialist capital accumulation. After discussions at meetings, workers wrote letters to Stalin making pledges. Workers in Leningrad pledged to exceed their plan and generate an additional 700 million rubles in profit this year; workers in Molotov City and Oblast pledged to increase profits by 300 million rubles; and workers in Kuibyshev pledged to increase profits by 265 million rubles. In addition, workers in Kyiv, workers in the Karelo-Finnish Republic, the workers of factories under the USSR Ministry of Grocery Industry, the workers of factories under the Russian Federation Ministry of Textile Industry, and light industrial workers in Moscow have all pledged to increase profits by nearly 100 million or even hundreds of millions of rubles respectively.

　　In the movement to increase profits, new forms of socialist cooperation among the working people have emerged. Scientists and specialists personally go to factories to cooperate with practitioners, formulating on-site plans to improve production organization and technology and increase profit margins. For example, as a result of cooperation between the "Kaliber" factory and the Moscow Institute of Engineering and Economics, the machine production in the first half of this year exceeded the cost reduction plan, and the profits obtained increased by 70% compared with the original plan. At the same time, advanced workers immediately pass on their experience to other workers. This is something unimaginable in capitalist society. An editorial in *Pravda* pointed out that the nationwide movement to increase profits proves that "Soviet industry, which has exceeded pre-war production levels, has accumulated sufficient internal strength to rapidly improve all economic indicators."

　　减本增利运动扩及全苏
    产生劳动人民间社会主义合作新形式
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社讯：苏联全国各地各业工人纷纷卷入减低生产成本，增加利润、增加社会主义资本积累的热潮。工人们在开会讨论后，写信向斯大林保证。列宁格勒的工人保证今年超过计划，额外增加七亿卢布的利润，莫洛托夫城及州的工人保证增加三亿卢布，古比雪夫工人保证增加二亿六千五百万卢布。此外基辅工人、卡累利亚芬兰共和国工人、苏联杂货工业部、俄罗斯联邦纺织工业部所属各厂工人及莫斯科轻工业工人，都分别保证增加近亿以至一亿数千万卢布的利润。
    在增加利润运动中，产生了劳动人民之间社会主义合作的新形式。科学家、专门家亲自到工厂里和实际工作者合作，实地制订改良生产组织与技术及提高利润率的计划。例如，“卡利伯”工厂和莫斯科工程与经济研究所合作的结果，在今年的上半年的器械生产中，超过了减低成本的计划，所获利润比原计划增加百分之七十。同时，先进工人也即时把经验传授给其他工人。这是资本主义社会所不可想象的事。真理报社论指出：全国范围的增加利润运动，证明“超过了战前生产水平的苏维埃工业，已经蓄积了足够的内在力量，足以急速的提高一切经济指数。”
