Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th. The Kuomintang is increasingly relying on the assistance of traitors in the Northeast. One new development in this policy is that Han Yunjie, the former puppet Manchurian governor of Heilongjiang Province, has been sent to Shenyang by He Yingqin. It is reported that Han was introduced to Beijing by Yu Bin a month ago, and in late August, he was introduced by He Yingqin to fly to Shenyang via Beiping to discuss with Wei Lihuang a plan for Han to incorporate puppet bandits in the Northeast.
