　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS reports: After Marshall, Bevin, and Schuman met on October 4th and decided to reject the Soviet government's October 3rd proposal to convene a Council of Foreign Ministers to consider the Berlin situation and the entire German question, the majority of the Security Council members, controlled by the United States, followed the decision of the three-person meeting and requested that the Berlin question be included on the Security Council's formal agenda. On the afternoon of the 4th, when the Security Council was discussing whether the Berlin question should be included on the agenda, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, issued a statement stating that the Berlin question should not be included on the Security Council's agenda because it was not within its jurisdiction and would directly violate Article 107 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates, "Nothing in the present Charter shall invalidate or preclude action, in relation to any state which during the Second World War has been an enemy of any signatory to the present Charter, taken or authorized as a result of that war by the Governments having responsibility for such action." Vyshinsky pointed out that convening a Council of Foreign Ministers was the only legitimate procedure for considering the Berlin and the entire German question. The US representative, Jessup, delivered a speech at the meeting, filled with attacks on the Soviet Union, but said very little about the essence of the Berlin question. Jessup could not refute that their request was unconstitutional, so he had to argue that Article 107 of the Charter was only of a "temporary" nature. The British representative, Jebb, likewise parroted Jessup's argument. On the 5th, the Security Council activated the mechanical voting machine and passed the inclusion of the Berlin question on the agenda by a vote of nine to two. After the vote, Vyshinsky again issued a statement stating that the Soviet delegation adheres to the position of the Soviet government's note to the US, British, and French governments on October 3rd and insists on opposing the inclusion of the Berlin question on the Security Council's agenda. In view of the fact that the majority of the Security Council has resolved to include the Berlin question on the agenda, the Soviet delegation announced that it will not participate in the Security Council's discussion of the Berlin question. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Manuilsky, agreed with Vyshinsky's statement and announced that the Ukrainian delegation would also not participate in the discussion of the Berlin question.

　　美英法强将柏林问题列入安理会议程
    苏联乌克兰拒绝参加讨论
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社讯：在马歇尔、贝文、舒曼于十月四日集会，决定拒绝苏联政府十月三日所提召开外长会议考虑柏林形势及整个德国问题的建议之后，受美国控制的安理会大多数理事国，遂遵照三人会议的决定，要求将柏林问题列入安理会的正式议程中。四日下午，当安理会讨论柏林问题是否应列入议程时，苏代表团长维辛斯基发表声明称，柏林问题不能列入安理会议程中，因为这不是它权限之内的事，且将直接违反联合国宪章第一百零七条，该条规定，“本宪章并不取消或禁止负行动责任之政府，对于在第二次世界大战中本宪章任何签字国之敌国因该次战争而采取或受权执行的行动。”维辛斯基指出，只有召开外长会议，才是考虑柏林和整个德国问题的唯一合法程序。美代表吉思普在会上发表演说，其言词充满对苏联的攻击，但对柏林问题的本质却很少论及。吉思普不能反驳他们的要求是违宪的，因此只好强辩说，宪章第一百零七条只具有“临时”性质。英代表贾德干也照样地背诵了吉思普的论断。五日，安理会开动了机械表决器，以九对二票通过将柏林问题列入议程中。维辛斯基在表决后再度发表声明称，苏联代表团坚持苏联政府十月三日致美英法政府照会的立场，并坚持反对将柏林问题列入安理会议程。鉴于安理会之大多数已决议将柏林问题列入议程中，苏联代表团宣布：它将不参加安理会对柏林问题的讨论。乌克兰外长曼努意斯基赞同维辛斯基的声明，并宣布乌克兰代表团亦不参加柏林问题的讨论。
