　　Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Sui Front, October 25th: In the autumn offensive in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, our army annihilated over 10,000 enemies, liberated five county towns and many important strongholds and stations along the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway in half a month of fighting, inflicting a major blow on the Fu bandit troops. The front headquarters recently issued a comprehensive battle report stating:
　　Simultaneously with the autumn offensives of the Northeast and Sui-Meng Front Liberation Army, our army, in coordination with a part of the local armed forces, launched continuous offensives in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway. Our army first captured Guyuan and Chongli, and annihilated two regiments of the 33rd Provisional Division of the enemy at Zhao Chuanbao, north of Xuanhua, with the vanguard directly approaching the outskirts of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. The Fu bandit troops were extremely shocked. On October 9th, our army turned to launch a fierce attack on the Ping-Zhang Railway, capturing many station strongholds, causing an unprecedented blow to the Ping-Zhang Railway, which the Fu bandits regarded as their "lifeline." From September 28th to October 15th, our army successively captured five cities, including Chongli, Shangyi, Zhuolu, Guyuan, and Nandou, as well as many important station strongholds such as Xinbaoan, Shacheng, Tumu, Chadao, Xibozhi, Qinglongqiao, and Badaling; and annihilated the entire 2nd and 3rd Regiments of the 31st Provisional Division of the 5th Provisional Army of the Fu bandits, the 280th Regiment of the 94th Division of the 16th Army (missing one battalion, previously mistaken for a whole regiment), most of the 3rd Battalion of the 64th Regiment of the 22nd Division of the 16th Army, and parts of the 11th, 12th, and 17th Guard Regiments, totaling 11,096 men, of which 5,879 enemies were killed or wounded, and 5,217 enemies were captured, including the commander of the 12th Guard Regiment, Pang Qijian, and the deputy commander, Yu Zhixuan; destroyed 167 li of railway between Jimingyi and Xinbaoan to Juyongguan and Changping, destroyed 20 bridges, and captured 5 92-type infantry guns (with gun bodies), 9 mortars, 34 60mm mortars, 8 grenade launchers, 33 heavy machine guns, 230 light machine guns, 3,183 rifles, 39 pistols, 60 submachine guns, 3 anti-tank rifles, 15 rifle grenades, 1,474 rounds of various artillery shells, 270,392 rounds of various bullets, 1 radio station, 55 telephones, 5,100 jin of electric wire, 3 trucks (1 captured, 2 destroyed), and a portion of other war spoils.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, October 26th: Industry, commerce, transportation, and postal services in the newly liberated areas of eastern Sui are rapidly recovering. Grains from the Longshengzhuang area northeast of Fengzhen, salt from the Daihaitan area of Liangcheng, fabrics and cotton from northwestern Shanxi and Tangxian, Hebei, and melons and fruits from Yanggao, are being sold in Fengzhen, Jining, Liangcheng, and other places. Local people are exchanging local products for fabrics and cotton to prepare for the winter. In Fengzhen, Jining, and other places, the price of millet has fallen by one-half, and the price of printed cloth has also fallen by one-third in the twenty days since liberation. Many shops in Fengzhen City that had posted notices of closure during the rule of the Fu bandits have reopened after liberation. The highways from Liangcheng to Zhuozishan and from Liangcheng via Fengzhen to Longshengzhuang have been repaired and opened to traffic in five days. The roadbeds of Guancun and other stations on the Ping-Sui Railway near Jining, which were destroyed by the Fu bandits, have also been repaired. Post offices have been established in Fengzhen, Liangcheng, Jining, and other cities, and newspapers and letters mailed from Xingxian, northwestern Shanxi, to Liangcheng can arrive in six days.
