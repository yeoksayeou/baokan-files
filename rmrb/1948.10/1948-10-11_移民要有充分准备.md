　　Immigration Requires Thorough Preparation
    Comrade Editor:
    Some villages in the 7th, 8th, and 9th districts of Xingtai suffered a flood in mid-June. Many households were washed away, leaving them without even a single plot of land. Some days ago, many people requested to immigrate to Yuci and Taigu in Shanxi. However, Yuci and Taigu are not in the same special district or county as us, so we dared not answer. Please tell us if immigration is possible, what procedures are required, whether there are any difficulties, and when can it take place?
    Xingtai Zhao Zengzhang
    Answer: Regarding the issue of immigration to Yuci and Taigu, because that area is newly recovered, the government has not yet decided on specific measures for immigration to that area. At the same time, there are many difficulties for refugees to move there. For example, production tools, fertilizers, seeds, and all the necessary expenses for settling down need to be fully prepared before immigration can proceed. Regarding the disaster victims in the 7th, 8th, and 9th districts of Xingtai, the government should do a good job of helping to organize them for production and resettlement if they have the labor force. At the same time, this issue should be quickly reported to the Taihang Administrative Office for resolution.

　　移民要有充分准备
    编辑同志：
    邢台七、八、九区有些村在六月中旬遭了一次水灾，有好多户都被水冲的连一垄地也无有了，前些日子有许多群众，要求往山西榆次、太谷一带移民。可是榆次、太谷和我们这地方又不是一个专、县，因此也不敢答复，请问是否能移民，须经过哪些手续？是否有困难？到啥时能移？
    邢台赵增章
    答　向榆次、太谷移民问题因那里是新收复区，政府尚未决定对该区移民的具体办法，同时难民移去亦有好多困难，如生产工具、肥料、种籽、及安家时所必需的一切费用，均需有充分准备，才能进行移民。关于邢台七、八、九区的灾民，有劳力的，政府要很好的帮助组织他们生产安家，同时应将此问题迅速请示太行行署解决。
