Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. TASS dispatch: The Soviet newspaper *Labor* published a commentary entitled "Ashida and His Successor," stating that "the replacement of one reactionary, Ashida, with another rabid reactionary, Yoshida, shows that the Japanese reactionaries and their American masters have completely failed to learn any lessons from the shameful collapse of the Ashida government." *Labor* described the reactionary measures of the Ashida cabinet, saying, "Giving huge subsidies to monopoly capitalists increased the national budget deficit, causing inflation and a further decline in the people's living standards. In June, prices rose by an average of 70 percent, exceeding pre-war levels by 110 times. By October, the cost of living in cities was 11,000 yen, while the average wage set by the government was 3,700 yen. Thus, the government was doomed to keep the working masses in a state of semi-starvation." "The wave of terror, the persecution of trade union workers and strikers, and the abuse of communists increased sharply during the Ashida government."

*Labor* pointed out, "Ashida overestimated his strength. The Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese Federation of Industrial Labor Unions led the struggle of the working class. The strike movement was expanding. The workers demanded a minimum wage of 11,000 yen, freedom for trade unions, and the resignation of the corrupt government. In many places, peasant organizations supported the workers' struggle. After Ashida's resignation, the Japanese Federation of Industrial Labor Unions passed a resolution stating that the collapse of the cabinet was the result of the people's offensive led by the working class." *Labor* concluded by saying that Japanese labor organizations are strengthening their struggle against Yoshida. The Communist Party and the Japanese Federation of Industrial Labor Unions demand the dissolution of the parliament controlled by the lackeys of the reactionaries, the holding of elections based on popular will, and the establishment of a people's government. Only such a government can improve the people's lives and rebuild a democratic Japan.

　　日共领导人民攻势下
  　芦田内阁可耻的垮台
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社讯：苏联劳动报顷以“芦田及其继任者”为题，评论日内阁的更迭称：以另一个穷凶极恶的反动分子吉田代替一个反动分子芦田，“这一变动，显示出日本反动派及其美国主子完全未能从芦田政府可耻的垮台上学得任何教训”。劳动报描写芦田内阁的反动措施说：“给予独占资本家的巨额津贴，增加了国家预算的赤字，引起通货膨胀和人民生活水平进一步的下降。六月份的物价平均上涨了百分之七十，超过战前水平一百一十倍。至十月份，城市生活费为一万一千日圆，而政府所规定的平均工资却是三千七百日圆。这样，政府便注定了要把劳动群众处在半饥饿的状态中。”“恐怖浪潮，对工会工作者和罢工者的迫害，虐待共产党人，在芦田政府任内急剧地增加了。”
    劳动报指出：“芦田过高估计了他的力量。日本共产党及日本产业劳动组合联合会，领导了工人阶级的斗争。罢工运动在扩展中。工人们要求一万一千日元的最低工资、工会的自由与腐败政府的辞职。在许多地方，农民组织支持工人的斗争。芦田辞职以后，日本产联通过决议称：内阁的垮台是工人阶级所率领的人民攻势的结果。”劳动报最后称：日本劳工组织正加强着反对吉田的斗争。共产党和产联要求解散为反动派奴仆所控制的议会，根据民意举行选举，成立人民政府。只有这种政府才能改善人民生活和重建民主的日本。
