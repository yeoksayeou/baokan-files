　　Criticism and Suggestions

　　One Should Not Lightly Arrest and Beat People
　　Recently, a serious phenomenon of cadres in the first district of Pingshan lightly arresting and torturing people has occurred. On the 26th of last month, the Chengguan police station asked Bai Qinglu, who was gambling in Dongguan, for gambling tools and arrested Bai in the middle of the night and beat him up. At that time, we made suggestions to stop it, but it was ineffective. Later, we found Comrade Kang Zhaoyi of the district committee. According to him, "This kind of phenomenon has been happening constantly before, and we are now reviewing and correcting it."
　　However, less than five days later, the district government arrested Lu Huichang, a disabled soldier from Dong Street, on the grounds of beating his wife and resisting the government. The reason was that when Lu was beating his wife, the masses and the work team tried to dissuade him without success, and the district cadres came out to mediate, but he refused to obey. Feng, the district head, quarreled loudly with Lu and tied Lu up to a tree. He explained the reason for the binding to Lu, saying, "Binding you is not only because you beat your wife, but because you are resisting the government. Your body is strong, so to avoid accidents, we tied you up." Later, Lu was put in solitary confinement.
　　The interrogation began that night, and the district head and others were present. The district head also said, "You fought in the War of Resistance against Japan for eight years, you are capable. Go ahead and sue us, we will also make some preparations. We know you will retaliate when you get out, so we will beat you first."
　　I believe this way of handling problems is the yamen style of the old ruling class.
　　Some comrades also said that hitting is certainly wrong, but it is impossible not to hit. In dealing with the problem of petty theft, many also use hitting to solve the problem, but theft has not decreased as a result. It is hoped that the Pingshan County Government and other county governments with similar situations will conduct a thorough inspection. (Guo Enqing, Chengguan Work Team, Pingshan)

　　不应轻易捕人打人
    近来平山一区发生干部轻易捕人吊打人的严重现象。上月二十六日，城关派出所向东关聚赌者白清禄要赌具，半夜将白逮捕，拷打了一顿。当时我们曾提出建议制止无效。后来找到该区委康兆一同志。据他说：“此类现象以前也不断发生，现正检讨纠正。”
    但言不出五日，该区政府又以打骂老婆与对抗政府的罪名，将东街荣军卢会昌逮捕。理由是卢打老婆时，群众和工作组劝解无效，区干部出来调解，亦不服从。该区封区长与卢大吵大嚷，并将卢大绑起来，捆在树上。并向卢解释捆绑原因说：“绑你不仅是你打了老婆，而是你对抗政府。你的身体又强壮，为避免意外，才把你绑起来。”后又把卢关了禁闭。
    当晚开始审讯，区长等均在座。区长并说：“你抗战八年，你有本事，你告我们去吧，我们也做点准备，知道你出去会报复，先打了你再说。”
    我认为这种处理问题的办法，是旧统治阶级的衙门作风。
    有的同志还说打固然不对，但是不打也不行。在处理小偷问题上，也有不少用打来解决问题的，但偷盗并未因此减少。希望平山县府及有类似情形的其他县府好好检查一下。（平山城关工作组郭恩庆）
