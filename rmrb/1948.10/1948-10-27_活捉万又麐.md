　　Capture of Wan Youlin Alive

　　The 48th Brigade was annihilated, and its commander, Wan Youlin, along with his four guards, attempted to escape being captured alive at dawn on the 7th, taking advantage of the dim light.

　　The People's Liberation Army's encirclement was so tight that Wan Youlin's attempts to flee south and west failed. Finally, he encountered the brave warriors of the machine gun and artillery company of the 1st platoon, 4th detachment of the "East Society" unit. At that time, the soldiers noticed several shadows moving. Soldier Li Shenghui immediately shouted, "Who's there? Come over here!" "Don't shoot, don't shoot, it's us, we're coming!" the shadows said as they turned and ran. Li Shenghui and several comrades chased after them with big strides. The four guards abandoned their brigade commander and ran off in different directions. Comrade Li Shenghui raised a grenade and chased after Wan Youlin, shouting, "Stop! If you run, I'll shoot you!" Just then, a flare was fired, and Wan Youlin was so frightened that he immediately lay on the ground. Comrade Li Shenghui grabbed him and said, "Get up, get up, I won't shoot you."

　　After Li Shenghui pulled him up, he saw that he was wearing a serge military uniform and leather shoes, his lower body covered in mud, and he was carrying a cane. So he asked him, "What kind of officer are you?" "I'm a soldier." "No way! A soldier doesn't look like you?!" Helpless, he then claimed to be the "Chief of the Replenishment Training Regiment," but it was not until he arrived at the temporary reception center and was identified by other prisoners that he admitted to being Wan Youlin.

### 活捉万又麐

　　活捉万又麐
    四十八旅被歼灭了，旅长万又麐带着他的四个卫士，七日拂晓，借着朦胧的天色，企图逃脱被活捉的命运。
    解放军的包围圈是那样严密，万又麐的南逃西窜都失败了。最后他碰到了“东社”部四支队一中队机炮连的勇士们。当时，战士们发现有几个影子在蠕动，战士李生会立即大叫道：“什么人？过来！”“别打，别打，自已人，过去啦。”那几个影子一面这样说着，一面扭头就跑。李生会和几个同志大踏步的追上前去，那四个卫士丢下了他们的旅长，单独朝一个方面跑去了。李生会同志高举着手榴弹，向万又麐追去，并喊道：“站住！再跑，就打死你！”正在这时，忽然打过来一颗照明弹，万又麐吓得立刻卧在地上，李生会同志一把拉住他：“起来，起来，打不死你。”
    李生会把他拉起来后，看他穿一身哔叽军服，脚上穿着皮鞋，下半截身子沾满了泥水，手里还提着一根手杖，于是就问他：“你是当什么官的？”“我是当兵的。”“不对！当兵的那是你这个样子？！”他无法，又说是什么“补训团长”，直到到了临时招待所，经过其他的俘虏证明，他才承认是万又麐。
