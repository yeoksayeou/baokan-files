Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th. More than 500 students from Changchun University, unable to bear the dark rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, have recently escaped to Jilin City. Students from eight schools, including Jilin Provincial United Middle School, specially selected more than 300 representatives to form a joint consolation group, bringing with them donated consolation money, books, stationery, daily necessities, etc., to express their sympathy. They hoped that the students of various universities who had engaged in anti-hunger and anti-American imperialism's support of Japan and Chiang Kai-shek under Kuomintang rule in the past would continue to fight on the same front in the future and serve the people. The Changchun University students recounted the crimes of the Kuomintang in persecuting young students and used their personal experiences to illustrate the difference between life in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas. Both sides also held a joint celebration.
