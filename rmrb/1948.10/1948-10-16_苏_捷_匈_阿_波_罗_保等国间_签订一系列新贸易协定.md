Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Comprehensive report: Since September, a series of economic and trade agreements have been signed between the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe, as well as among the latter. Recently, a new agreement was concluded between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, increasing the amount of goods exchanged from 5 billion Czech crowns to 9 billion, making Czechoslovakia the Soviet Union's top trading partner. On the Soviet side, it already ranked first in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade at the beginning of this year. In addition to the supplies previously agreed upon, the Soviet Union will increase its supplies to Czechoslovakia by 300,000 tons of wheat, 25,000 tons each of meat and fats, and 10,000 tons of cotton. At the same time, the Soviet Union also signed trade agreements with Hungary and Albania. Hungary will import raw materials from the Soviet Union necessary for implementing its economic plan. Albania will receive industrial equipment, agricultural machinery, and grain. The Albanian Minister of Industry said, "Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, Albania will become an economically independent country."

According to official Polish reports: Poland's exports in the first half of this year totaled more than 220 million US dollars, and imports totaled more than 250 million US dollars, both doubling compared to the first half of last year. It is estimated that the Soviet Union is Poland's largest export destination. After signing a five-year economic cooperation treaty with Czechoslovakia, Poland signed another five-year economic cooperation treaty and a five-year trade agreement with Romania on September 10, forming an important and inseparable part of the two countries' economic plans. The treaty stipulates that Poland will expand the production of machinery for drilling oil wells to help Romania's oil industry develop, while Romania will supply Poland with oil, timber, and precious minerals. On September 25, Poland also signed a new agreement with the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, increasing the total trade volume for this year from 36 million US dollars to 96 million. Poland will supply the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany with 75,000 tons of coking coal and 65,000 tons of coal. The Czech government also recently approved a trade agreement with the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. In addition, the Czech and Hungarian governments are considering extending their new trade agreement to 1949, when Hungary's three-year plan is completed, with a total exchange value of 40 million US dollars. Long-term Czech-Hungarian agreements starting in 1950 are also being prepared. Hungary and Bulgaria have recently signed trade agreements with Finland, with Hungary obtaining industrial raw materials from Finland, and Bulgaria obtaining machinery and industrial products. In order to expand foreign trade, Bulgaria has allowed foreign industrial and commercial enterprises to establish delegations in Bulgaria to conclude commercial agreements.

Hungary with the British and American occupied zones of Germany, Romania with Belgium, and Czechoslovakia with Denmark and Switzerland have also signed trade agreements since August, generally exchanging agricultural products for industrial equipment from Western European countries. At the same time, trade negotiations between Czechoslovakia and India and Pakistan have also been completed.

　　苏·捷·匈·阿·波·罗·保等国间
  　签订一系列新贸易协定
    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合报导：九月以来苏联及东南欧各国之间及后者相互间又签订了一系列的经济与贸易协定。最近苏捷订立新协定，换货数量由五十亿捷币增至九十亿，捷克因而跃居苏联对外贸易的第一位。苏联方面，则在今年年初即已居捷克对外贸易的第一位。除前此所协议的供应以外，苏对捷即将增加供应小麦三十万吨、肉类及脂肪各二万五千吨，棉花一万吨。同时，苏联又和匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚签订了贸易协定。匈牙利将从苏联输入实行经济计划所必需的原料。阿国将得到工业装备，农业机器及谷物。阿工业部长说：“由于苏联的帮助，阿国将成为经济上独立的国家。”
    据波兰官方报告：波兰今年上半年输出共合二亿二千余万美元，输入共合二亿五千余万美元，均较去年上半年增加一倍。估波兰出口最多的是苏联。波兰在与捷克签订了五年经济合作条约之后，九月十日又与罗马尼亚订立了五年经济合作条约与五年贸易协定，构成两国经济计划中重要而不可分的一部分。条约中规定：波兰将扩大生产开凿油井的机械，帮助罗国石油工业的发展，罗国则以石油、木材及贵重矿物供给波兰。九月二十五日，波兰又与德境苏占区签订了新协定，将今年的贸易总额由三千六百万美元增加到九千六百万。波兰将供给德境苏占区焦煤七万五千吨，煤六万五千吨。捷克政府也于日前批准了与德境苏占区的贸易协定。此外，捷匈两国政府正考虑把两国的新贸易协定延长到一九四九年的即匈牙利三年计划完成之时，换货总额将合四千万美元。从一九五○年开始的捷匈长期协定也正在准备中。匈保两国最近都和芬兰签订了贸易协定，匈自芬将取得工业原料，保将取得机器与工业品。保加利亚为了扩展对外贸易，已准许外国工商等企业在保国设立代表团，以便订立商约。
    匈牙利与德境英美占领区，罗马尼亚与比利时，捷克与丹麦、瑞士自八月份以来亦先后签订贸易协定，一般以农产品向西欧国家换取工业装备。同时，捷克和印度及巴基斯坦贸易谈判亦已完成。
