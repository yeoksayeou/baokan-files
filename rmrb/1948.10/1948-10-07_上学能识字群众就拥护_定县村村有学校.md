　　If schooling enables literacy, the masses will support it
    Ding County has schools in every village
    [Our Newspaper] After correcting its policies, Ding County's education work has made considerable progress. The county has twenty districts, four hundred and one villages, and a population of 432,419. There are eight middle school classes, one normal school, thirty-six higher primary schools, and three hundred and fifty-eight lower primary schools, with a total of 34,543 students. This achieves one school per village. One district, with eighteen villages, has five higher primary schools. Li Village Store in the Tenth District has a lower primary school, a higher primary school, and also a middle school class. The composition of the students is also universal and broad. According to statistics from the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Districts in August, there were 3,467 students, including 35 farm laborers, 1,201 poor peasants, 2,045 middle peasants, 143 rich peasants, and 43 landlords. Because the schools can play an educational role, the masses also cherish the schools. An old man from Wu Yangping Village said, "Things are good now. Although we are poor, we have turned over, and our children can go to school and study for very little money." When the people of Da Chen Village saw that the school desks were broken, the whole village discussed and repaired forty-odd broken desks. Wu Zengjian from Wu Family Village said, "For generations, no one in my family has been literate. Now, I will send my Maochang to study." Farmers Che Lianzhu and Zhang Luoxiong from An Family Village automatically took the broken school desks to repair them, and branch secretary Zhang Zhiji promptly helped solve the teaching difficulties. Teacher Jia Zhaorui from Dongyang Village personally repaired the school toilets.
    During the land reform in the county, some cadres moved the feudal struggles from the countryside to the schools. Three teachers were beaten, and seven primary schools organized poor peasant associations to struggle against the teachers. At that time, the teachers' thinking was very confused, which caused a setback in primary school education for a time. It was not until January of this year that the deviations were corrected and our Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals was implemented, that the teachers felt at ease to work. The number of students has increased, but there are not enough teachers to allocate. Dongzhang Village has more than three hundred households, with more than one hundred children attending school, but only one teacher. Nanxinxing has more than one hundred and seventy students, but only one teacher. Mingyuetian has more than two hundred and fifty students, but only two teachers. In order to solve this problem, the county government selected forty-one students from short-term teacher training classes to become teachers, and ordered all villages to hire teachers on their own if they found them. County cadres also personally searched for unemployed former intellectuals in the countryside. In this way, eight former intellectuals who had graduated from specialized schools or above were promoted to work in middle school classes in the past six months. Later, through testing and inspection, it was found that some teachers had low cultural levels, which aroused dissatisfaction and even resistance from some children and parents. To solve this problem, the county government took the following measures: 1. Strengthen the learning of teachers in service. Each district organizes study groups based on small areas, and stipulates that collective discussions are held once a week to solve the difficulties in teaching. This is of great help to teachers. 2. Recruit intellectuals in the villages to form a short-term teacher training class, which is directly controlled by the county education section, and absorbed eighty-odd people. 3. Establish a teacher rotation training class. During the autumn break, some teachers with lower cultural levels and less teaching experience were greatly improved. In order to strengthen the connection between teaching and administration, it is stipulated that the principals of complete primary schools can participate in district affairs meetings, and teachers must participate in village affairs meetings.

### 上学能识字群众就拥护  定县村村有学校

　　上学能识字群众就拥护
    定县村村有学校
    【本报讯】定县教育工作自端正政策后有长足改进。全县二十个区，四○一个村，四三二、四一九口人，已有中学班八处，师范一处，高小三十六处，初小三五八处，共学生三四、五四三人。达到每村一所学校。一区十八个村，有五处高小。十区李村店一个村，有初小，有高小。又有中学班。学员成份上也达到了普遍和广泛。据十四、十七两个区八月份统计，共有学生三、四六七人，内有雇农三十五人，贫农一、二○一人，中农二、○四五人，富农一四三人，地主四三人。由于学校能起教学作用，因此群众对学校也爱护。吴羊平村一个老头说：“现在可不错了，穷吧，翻了身，孩子花不多几个钱也能上学念书了。”大陈村群众见到学校桌坏了，全村商议把四十来张坏桌修理了一下。吴家庄吴增见说：“早先俺家几辈子没有识字的，现在把俺茂长也送去念念书。”安家庄农民车连珠、张洛雄看到学桌坏了，即自动拿着去修理，支书张志计及时帮助解决教书困难。东杨村教员贾兆瑞亲自修理学校厕所。
    该县在土改中，曾有一些干部搬运农村斗争封建到学校，有三个教员被打，七处小学组织了贫农团，斗争了教员。当时教员思想很混乱，使小学教育受到一度挫折。直到今年一月间纠正了偏向，执行了我党的团结改造知识分子政策，教员们才安心工作起来。学生增多了，教员可又不足分配。东丈村三百多户，上学儿童百余人，只一个教师。南辛兴学生一百七十多人。只一个教员。明月店二百五十多学生，只有二个教员。县府为解决这个问题，曾从短期师训班选拔了四十一个学生来当教员，并明令各村如发现教员，可自行聘请。县干部也亲自在农村物色失业的旧知识分子。这样半年来提拔了八个专门以上毕业的旧知识分子参加到中学班工作。以后从测验和检查中，又发现有些教员文化低，以致引起一些儿童和家长的不满，甚至反抗。在解决这个问题上，县府采取了如下措施：一、加强在职教员的学习，各区以小区为单位组织学习小组，规定每周集体研讨一次，以解决教学中的困难，这样对教员的帮助很大。二、招收在乡知识分子，成立师资短训班，由县教育科直接掌握，吸收了八十来名。三、成立教师轮训班。利用秋假期间，把一些文化较低、教学经验少的教员提高不少。为了加强教学与行政的连系，规定完小校长可参加区务会，教员要参加村务会。　　（正）
