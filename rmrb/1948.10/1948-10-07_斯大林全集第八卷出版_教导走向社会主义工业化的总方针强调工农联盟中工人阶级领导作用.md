　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: TASS, Moscow: The latest volume of Stalin's Complete Works—Volume VIII—has recently been published. Much of its content consists of previously unpublished documents, including most of the writings from 1926. The year 1926 was when the Soviet government, based on the resolutions of the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, began implementing the general line of national socialist industrialization. Stalin's teachings at that time are still applicable to today's Soviet Union and to the people's democratic countries that are now embarking on socialism. At that time, the Soviet Union was still a backward agricultural country, and the relationship between the working class and the peasants was one of the most important issues that needed to be clarified. Stalin pointed out in 1926: The Soviet Union is the only country in the world where the worker-peasant alliance has defeated the landlords and capitalists. "This is because, in our country, the working class, experienced in struggle, has led and continues to lead the revolutionary movement." In establishing a solid alliance between the working class and the middle peasants, the working class must occupy a leading position. Ideas that undermine the leading role of the working class will completely destroy the worker-peasant alliance and lead to the restoration of capitalists and landlords. Stalin resolutely refuted the defeatist theory that peasants could not be socialized. He said, "It is impossible to build socialism without the participation of the peasants; without the proletariat, the peasants cannot drive away their poverty." "The peasants must embark on the road of socialist development, because there is no other way, nor can there be any other way, to save the peasants from poverty and bankruptcy except by allying with the proletariat, combining with socialist industry, and incorporating the peasant economy into the general road of socialist development through mass peasant cooperation." Volume VIII of Stalin's Complete Works also draws attention to one of the basic principles of socialist construction announced by the Soviet leaders on the eve of the beginning of the Five-Year Plan—economy and increased labor productivity. Stalin emphasized the importance of developing heavy industry production and called for the implementation of a strict system of priority for state enterprise investment. But Stalin also insisted that it would be impossible to make rapid progress towards socialism unless all possible methods were taken to reduce the expenses of state institutions and implement an "economy system" to reduce the cost of industrial production. By eliminating miners and adopting tough policies against theft of state property, waste of materials, and irresponsibility, the goals of reducing expenses and lowering costs were achieved to some extent. But the main way was to increase individual productivity and train technical personnel. The TASS reporter stated: The Soviet Union today still requires the implementation of an "economy system," adopting methods such as reducing administrative expenses, establishing enterprises on a self-sufficient basis (including abolishing state subsidies), and strictly controlling raw materials to reduce costs. At the same time, due to the further mechanization of the production process and the improvement of worker skills, individual productivity has been greatly improved, so that Soviet industry can solve the post-war labor problem.

### 斯大林全集第八卷出版　教导走向社会主义工业化的总方针强调工农联盟中工人阶级领导作用

　　斯大林全集第八卷出版
    教导走向社会主义工业化的总方针强调工农联盟中工人阶级领导作用
    【新华社陕北五日电】电通社莫斯科讯：斯大林全集最新的一卷——第八卷已于最近出版，内容有许多是迄未发表的文献，包括一九二六年的大部分著作。一九二六年正是苏维埃政府根据联共党十四次代表大会决议，开始实行国家社会主义工业化总方针的时候，斯大林在那时的教导仍适用于今日的苏联，也适用于现正走向社会主义的人民民主国家。当时苏联还是落后的农业国，工人阶级和农民的关系问题是当时需要澄清的最重要的问题之一。斯大林在一九二六年指出：苏联是全世界唯一的工农联盟已战胜地主和资本家的国家。“这是因为在我国，有斗争经验的工人阶级曾经而且继续领导革命运动”，而在工人阶级和中农建立巩固的联盟中，工人阶级必须占领导地位。损害工人阶级起领导作用的思想，结果将完全破坏工农联盟而使资本家和地主复辟。斯大林坚决驳斥了认为农民不能社会主义化的失败主义理论。他说：“没有农民参加，就不可能建立社会主义；没有无产阶级，农民也不能驱除他们的贫困。”“农民必须走上社会主义发展的道路，因为除了和无产阶级联盟，除了和社会主义工业结合，除了通过农民群众性的合作、把农民经济纳入社会主义发展的总道路，此外再没有也不能有任何其他的道路，能把农民从贫困和破产中拯救出来。”斯大林全集第八卷同时提起人们注意苏维埃领袖在开始五年计划前夕所宣布的社会主义建设基本原则之一——节约与提高劳动生产率。斯大林强调发展重工业生产的重要性，号召实行严格的国家企业投资的优先权制度。但斯大林同时坚称：除非采取了一切可能的方法减少国家机构的开支，实行“节约制”以减低工业生产的成本，否则就不可能迅速向社会主义进展。由于清除矿工，由于对偷窃国家财富，损耗物资和不负责任等行为采取强硬政策，在一定程度上达到了减少开支和减低成本的目的。但主要的办法是提高个人生产率，训练技术人员。电通社记者称：苏联今天仍要求实行“节约制”，采取减少行政开支，使企业建立在自给的基础上（包括取消国家津贴），严格控制原料等办法来减低成本。同时由于生产过程进一步机械化，提高工人技术，大大提高个人生产率，这样就能使苏联工业解决战后劳动力问题。
