[Jinzhong Telegram] Thanks to the democratic government's active support for industry and commerce, and the convenient conditions such as the smooth transportation in the liberated areas, the Pingyao freight forwarding industry, which was on the verge of collapse due to the devastation of the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan's bandits, has gradually revived and prospered. The number of freight forwarding companies has increased from three during Yan Xishan's rule to nine. Each inn is frequently occupied by merchants carrying goods worth millions or even three to four tens of millions of yuan. The number of merchants ranges from fifteen or sixteen to more than thirty. The Pingyao freight forwarding industry was most prosperous in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921). At that time, merchants from northern Shaanxi transported furs, Quwo wood boards and tobacco, Hongdong paper, Qikou wheat, and grain from the Shangdang Basin for trade here. The freight forwarding companies transported goods by the trainload, hence the saying, "Pingyao can never be emptied, and Pingyang Prefecture can never be filled." During the Japanese occupation, under the threat of their strengthened security, merchants dared not transport goods, and most of the forwarding stations were converted into storage stations. Under Yan Xishan's rule, on the one hand, transportation was blocked, and on the other hand, Yan Xishan imposed unlimited exorbitant taxes, which made the inn business even more depressed, and they closed down one after another. At that time, the only merchants coming and going were short-distance merchants from Taiyuan, Fenyang, and Jiexiu. Each inn usually had no more than three or five guests, and very few goods. Only three freight forwarding companies, such as Yixinglong, remained. The other three companies, such as ＠ji, hung up the sign of Yan Xishan's government-run agency (Yan Xishan's agency contributed shares) and switched to other businesses to reduce the burden. Since liberation, merchants have flocked in from all directions. Merchants from Changzhi transport large quantities of vegetable oil, kerosene, towels, socks, soap, brown sugar, and white sugar manufactured in the liberated areas; merchants from Quwo transport dry tobacco; Hongdong transports paper; and Qikou merchants transport wheat, making the Pingyao freight forwarding trade prosperous again.

　　客商自由来往平遥百货交流
    【晋中电】由于民主政府对工商业积极扶植和解放区四通八达，客商自由往来等便利条件，被日寇阎匪摧残至奄奄一息的平遥货栈业又逐渐复活繁荣起来。客货栈由阎匪统治时期的三家增至九家。每家客栈都经常住有携带百万元以至三四千万元货物的客商。少者十五六个人，多者三十余人。平遥货栈业在民国十年时最为兴隆。当时陕北客人运来皮毛，曲沃木板、烟草，洪洞的纸，碛口的麦，上党盆地的粮食，都在此处交易。货栈转运货物都以火车计算，有“拉不完的平遥、填不满的平阳府”之谚。日寇统治时，在其强化治安的威胁下，客人不敢运货，转运栈乃大部改为留货栈。在阎匪统治下，一方面是交通阻绝，一方面是阎匪无限的苛捐杂税，致使客栈交易更加萧条，纷纷倒闭。当时往来的不过是太原、汾阳、介休三地的短路客人。每家栈房经常不过三五个客人，货物极少。客货栈只剩下义兴隆等三家。＠记等三家则挂起了阎匪机关公营的牌子（阎匪机关出好汉股子），转营他业，以减少负担。自解放以后，客商从四面八方涌来。长治客人运来大批解放区制造的植物油、煤油、手巾、袜子、肥皂、红糖、白糖，曲沃客人运来旱烟，洪洞运来纸，碛口客人运来麦，使平遥货栈交易又繁荣起来。
