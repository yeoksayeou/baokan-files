Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 25th -- The city of Changchun, after its liberation, is beginning to come back to life. The shadow of starvation, death, and terror that had enveloped the city under the dark rule of the Kuomintang for over two years is rapidly disappearing. The citizens have swept away their worried looks and are gathering in the streets to watch the democratic government's announcements and the People's Liberation Army's front-line victories. They are pouring out to the PLA soldiers and democratic government workers who have entered the city, telling them about the various disasters they suffered during the Kuomintang army's rule and expressing their heartfelt gratitude to the PLA for freeing them from their misery. After our democratic municipal government started working on the morning of the 21st, the former Kuomintang personnel have come to register one after another, and they have handed over their official documents, certificates, and weapons. The various municipal enterprises were taken over by the democratic government in an organized manner on the 21st and immediately began to reorganize. The takeover of the city's water plant went the best, with all equipment, facilities, accounts, statistics, etc., being undamaged under the proper protection of the plant's employees. Under the leadership of the new factory director, the entire plant has now resumed work and is supplying water. Postal and telecommunications workers who entered the city with the army, after a day and night of intense effort, completely restored the city's telephone, postal service, and long-distance telephone and telegraph services to other places on the 21st. The Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration issued a notice that it would formally handle military, government, and commercial postal and telecommunications services from now on. The railway from Changchun to Jilin has also been quickly repaired and opened to traffic. The citizens were ecstatic to hear the rumble of trains again.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th -- For a week, the 800,000 citizens of Harbin have been enthusiastically celebrating the successive liberation of Jinzhou and Changchun. On the 17th, all circles in Harbin held an unprecedented 120,000-person celebration rally, followed by a victory parade. The mighty and magnificent parade marched through the main streets of Harbin for two hours. Speakers at the celebration rally included Wu Xiuquan, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Military Region; Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Government Committee; Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee; and labor hero Liu Yingyuan. Everyone called on all circles in Harbin to give full play to the city's material strength, step up production, and ensure that the soldiers at the front receive sufficient supplies; to give full play to human resources and train cadres to meet the needs of the army and the newly liberated areas. The meeting passed a congratulatory telegram to Lin Biao, Commander of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, Luo Ronghuan, Political Commissar, and all commanders and fighters amidst warm applause.

    The entire city has been hung with national flags for days, and propaganda teams and Yangge teams from various units have emerged on the streets. Everywhere there are cheers, applause, and the sound of gongs and drums. Amid the celebrations, the workers in various factories are carrying out production with a hundred times more energy. Since the news of the liberation of Jinzhou, each cotton-padding clothing factory has completed 3,700 sets of military uniforms every day, an increase of 700 sets compared to normal days. Workers in a certain military factory voluntarily requested to work two hours overtime in order to complete production tasks ahead of schedule. Schools and organizations have enthusiastically signed up to participate in front-line comfort teams and to donate blood for wounded soldiers. The city's Youth League and Children's Corps decided to write 100,000 letters of sympathy and make 10,000 comfort bags for the army within ten days. Citizens are donating various kinds of goods and cash to the front lines.
