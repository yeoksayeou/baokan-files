　　Commander – Messenger – Medic
    Yang Zhengang, The Triple Threat
    Yang Zhengang, a medic in the seventh company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, who had only recently joined the Communist Party of China, played the roles of commander, messenger, and medic during the Kaifeng Campaign. The soldiers gave him the glorious title of "Yang the Triple Threat."
    When Seventh Company Commander Meng Huiwen led a platoon in a breakthrough at the South Gate of Kaifeng, Yang Zhengang was bandaging the wounded of the Eighth Company, thinking to himself: "How can I stay behind?" He quickly bandaged the two wounded soldiers and caught up with the assault team in one breath. After Company Commander Meng sacrificed himself, he immediately moved to the second platoon's position. At this time, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, and they counterattacked several times. He encouraged and helped the second platoon's deputy commander to resolutely hold the position.
    Yang Zhengang turned and went up to the South Gate tower. At this time, machine gunner Yuan Xueyi was using his machine gun to sweep the attacking enemy. He bandaged the wounded while encouraging everyone, saying, "As long as we hold the position well, we will definitely be able to cooperate with the follow-up troops to annihilate the enemy guarding the city." Before long, the second platoon's deputy was also wounded. In this tense situation, he completed the bandaging task and volunteered to contact the brother units. Enemy shells exploded around the city gate tower. Machine gunner Yuan Xueyi was wounded a second time. Yang Zhengang disregarded all danger and went up to the city gate tower again, bandaging and comforting each wounded soldier, and moving them to indoor areas or air-raid shelters. When he discovered that one of our machine guns on the city gate tower was broken, he again took the initiative to contact the brother units and quickly added a machine gun, which played a significant role in holding the South Gate position. In the post-battle commendation, everyone unanimously agreed to give him a meritorious service award. At the "August 1st" celebration meeting, Yang Zhengang received the People's Hero Medal.

### 指挥员——通讯员——卫生员　三员杨振刚

　　指挥员——通讯员——卫生员
    三员杨振刚
    才参加中国共产党不久的解放军某团七连卫生员杨振刚，在开封战役中，一人起了指挥员、通讯员、卫生员三种作用。战士们给他起了个光荣的称号，叫他“杨三员”。
    当七连长孟慧文带领一排突进开封南门时，杨振刚正在给八连伤员包扎，心想着：“怎能留在后面呢？”他迅速把两个伤员包扎好，便一气赶上突击队。孟连长牺牲后，他立即转到二排阵地上。这时敌炮火猛烈，并几次反扑，他鼓励和帮助着二排副指挥，坚决守住阵地。
    杨振刚转身上了南门城门楼，这时机枪手袁学义正用机枪向反击的敌人扫射，他一面给伤员包扎，一面鼓舞大家说：“只要好好守住阵地，一定能配合后续部队歼灭守城敌人。”不一会，二排副又负了伤。在这种紧张情况下，他完成了包扎任务，并自告奋勇，去和兄弟连队进行联络。敌人炮弹在城门楼周围爆炸，机枪手袁学义二次负伤，杨振刚不顾一切危险，再次上了城门楼，给每个伤员包扎，安慰他们，并把他们移向室内或防空洞。当他发现城门楼上我们一挺机枪坏了，就又主动地和兄弟连队联络，很快地增加上了一挺机枪，这对坚持南门阵地起了很大作用。在战后三评中，大家一致通过给他记功；“八一”庆功大会上，杨振刚获得了人民英雄奖章。　　　　　　　　　（新华社中原电）
