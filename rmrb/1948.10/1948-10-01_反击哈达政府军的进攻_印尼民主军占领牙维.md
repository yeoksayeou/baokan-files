　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th -- TASS, citing the Dutch news agency, reports: On the 23rd, Hatta government troops in Indonesia launched an offensive against the city of Madiun, controlled by the Indonesian Democratic Forces. Slaguh, approximately 50 kilometers northwest of Madiun, Madgedan, 20 kilometers west, Ponorogo, 25 kilometers south, and Pacitan, a key coastal location 90 kilometers southwest of Madiun, are all in the hands of the Democratic Forces. Fighting is taking place in Pacitan and Yawei, 30 kilometers north of Madiun. According to Indonesian News Agency reports, Yawei has been occupied by the Democratic Forces after fierce fighting. Fighting is also occurring in southern Sumatra. Agence France-Presse quoted Shariffudin, Minister of Military Defense of the Indonesian Communist Party, in a radio broadcast from Madiun on the 23rd, stating, "The Indonesian Democratic Forces have not been intimidated by the provocations of the reactionary government of the Republic and are prepared to respond with force." He called on all people to support "the people's struggle led by the Communist Party." According to Indonesian News Agency reports, the Hatta government continues to arrest progressive elements on a large scale in Yogyakarta and other locations; many officers of all ranks in the government forces have been arrested. This demonstrates the instability of the Hatta government's rule. American and Dutch imperialists are conspiring to further intervene. TASS, citing a report from The Hague's "Nieuwe Courant" correspondent in Paris, states that the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France to the United Nations, who maintain close contact with the Dutch delegation, believe that "the primary task of the Netherlands should be to interfere in the internal affairs of the Indonesian Republic in order to suppress the Communist Party." The correspondent stated that Marshall had a long conversation with the Dutch delegation regarding the situation in Indonesia.

　　反击哈达政府军的进攻
    印尼民主军占领牙维
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社引荷兰通讯社消息：印尼哈达政府部队于二十三日向印尼民主军控制的茉莉芬城进攻。茉莉芬西北约五十公里之斯拉金、西面二十公里之马吉丹、南面二十五公里之波诺罗哥，以及茉莉芬西南九十公里的海岸要地派齐丹，都在民主军手中。战事在派齐丹和茉莉芬北面三十公里的牙维进行。另据印尼通讯社消息：牙维在激战之后，已为民主军所占领。战事亦在苏门答腊南部发生。据法新社引述，印尼共产党军事防卫部部长沙利佛丁二十三日在茉莉芬电台广播称：“印尼民主军并没有为共和国反动政府的挑衅所吓倒，已准备以武力来回答”。他号召全体人民支持“由共产党领导的人民斗争。”据印尼通讯社消息：哈达政府继续大事逮捕日惹及其他各地的进步分子；政府部队中各级军官有许多被捕。此显示哈达政府统治的不稳。美荷帝国主义正阴谋作进一步干涉。塔斯社引海牙“纽维·科伦特”报记者自巴黎的报导称：联大中与荷兰代表团保持密切联系之美英法三国代表团认为：“荷兰的首要任务应是干涉印尼共和国的内政，以镇压共产党”。该记者称：马歇尔曾与荷兰代表团就印尼局势作长谈。
