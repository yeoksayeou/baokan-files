  　Calls for Good Autumn Ploughing
    [Taihang Telegraph] This newspaper published a short commentary on the 13th of this month, titled "Lead the Autumn Ploughing Movement Well," the article is as follows: Launching the autumn ploughing movement to strive not to leave an acre of stubble land is an important step to improve agricultural production by an inch next year. Leaders at all levels should firmly grasp this point and lead the masses to complete the current autumn ploughing movement in accordance with the spirit of "production work has no flexibility" instructed by the District Party Committee. There has been a lot of rain this autumn, and the ground may freeze earlier than in previous years. In addition, there is a lack of labor and livestock, and insect pests are participating in the war in some areas. If the leadership is slightly delayed or relaxed, the autumn ploughing will inevitably not be completed once the ground freezes. Therefore, launching the autumn ploughing movement has become the central task of current production work. To this end, we must pay attention to and specifically solve the following problems: (1) Eliminate ideological obstacles. In most areas where land reform has not yet ended, some people are still worried about land being taken back. Therefore, they lack interest in autumn ploughing or the ploughing is very rough. Some people in Neiqiu are afraid of working hard for nothing. How well this problem is solved has a great relationship with the universal completion of autumn ploughing. Therefore, all localities should repeatedly publicize and explain that the land reform in our region has been completely completed, and the land will basically not be moved in the land reform work after the autumn, but only a small part of the land will be adjusted. Even if a small amount of land is moved, it must be guaranteed to give the tiller a certain price. Secondly, publicize the benefits and importance of autumn ploughing. (2) Pay attention to solving the problem of labor and livestock shortages. In addition to participating in the war, all labor and livestock at home should be organized on a voluntary basis to carry out extensive exchange of labor and mutual labor between people and animals, or organize people to pull plows. The masses should democratically discuss wages and labor exchange methods to ensure that people and animals do not suffer losses. (3) Leaders must check and promote concretely at any time, not satisfied with general meetings and plans. Cadres should personally go to the fields and organize the masses to conduct inspections, and implement technical guidance to make the autumn ploughing work fast and well.

　　太行新华日报
  　号召作好秋耕
    【太行电】此间新华日报于本月十三日发表短论，题为“把秋耕运动领导好”，文略如下：开展秋耕运动争取不留一亩茬地，这是明年农业生产提高一寸的一个重要步骤，各级领导上应该紧紧的掌握这一点，按照区党委指示的“生产工作没有伸缩性”的精神来领导群众完成当前的秋耕运动。今秋雨水不少，地冻时间可能比往年为早，再加劳畜力缺乏及部分地区虫害参战等，如稍一迟缓放松领导，地一上冻秋耕势必不能完成，因此开展秋耕运动就成为当前生产工作的中心任务了。为此必须注意与具体解决以下几个问题：（一）扫除思想障碍。大部未结束土改地区部分群众，怕抽地的顾虑仍然存在，因此对秋耕缺乏兴趣或者耕时也很粗糙。内邱即有些群众怕耕了白出力。这个问题解决的好与坏，对普遍完成秋耕有很大关系，所以各地应反复宣传说明我区土改已彻底完成，秋后的结束土改工作土地基本上不动，只是调剂小部分土地，即使有少部地动了，也要保证给耕地者以一定的代价。其次并宣传秋耕的好处及其重要性。（二）重视解决劳畜力困难问题，除参战外把所有在家的劳畜力，在自愿的基础上组织起来，进行广泛的换工与人畜变工，或组织人拉犁，由群众民主议订工资与变工办法，做到人畜互不吃亏。（三）领导人必须随时检查具体推动，不满足于一般开会布置与计划，干部要亲自上地与组织群众进行检查，并贯彻技术领导，使秋耕工作耕得快又耕得好。
