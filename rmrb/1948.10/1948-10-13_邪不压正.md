　　Good Overcomes Evil
    One. "Too much bullying!"
    In the Mid-Autumn Festival of the lunar calendar in 1943, Ruan Ying, the daughter of Wang Jucai of Xiahe Village, got engaged to Liu Zhong, the son of Liu Xiyuan of the same village. The Liu family sent gifts to the Jucai family on this day. The day before, Jucai had invited his brother-in-law from Shanghe Village to prepare a feast for the matchmaker, and he was busy all day preparing everything.

    On the 15th, Jucai got up a little later because he was feeling unhappy. Before he got up, he heard someone in the courtyard saying, "Congratulations, congratulations! I'm here to help!" He immediately recognized the voice of Old Guai, a poor man from the village.

    Although Old Guai was a poor man, he was not bad. He didn't steal or cheat. If a family had a wedding or funeral, he would help out if he got along well, eat a meal, and take some leftover food. If he didn't get along, he wouldn't go even if he was hungry. For example, Jucai's in-law, Liu Xiyuan, was a famous rich man within twenty miles, but he never went to his place. Jucai was just an ordinary peasant family, but he insisted on coming to his place. When he arrived, he said a few auspicious words, then swept the yard and carried water, doing his work conscientiously.

    Jucai slept for a while longer, then heard his wife say in the courtyard, "Anfa! You came so early? Your aunt also came? -- Jinsheng! Quickly take your aunt's basket! -- Anfa! Your sister is not a stranger! Why are you being so extravagant, buying so much? -- Gougou! Let your aunt see if you've gotten fatter! Why haven't you come to aunt's house for dates these past two days? -- Your brother-in-law is feeling a bit unwell, he hasn't gotten up yet! Jinsheng's wife! Please take your aunt to sit in the east room! -- Jinsheng's father! Get up quickly! The guests have arrived!" Jucai heard that it was his wife's younger brother and his wife, who he was usually familiar with, so he didn't get up immediately, but just called out, "Anfa! Come inside and sit!" Anfa's wife and Jinsheng's wife went into the east room, and Anfa went to Jucai's north room.

    According to the custom here, when a brother-in-law and sister's younger brother meet, they always say a joking word or two. As soon as Anfa entered the door, he said to Jucai, "Still not getting up at this hour! You've just become related to the Liu family, you've learned Liu Xiyuan's comfortable ways?" Jucai sat up, putting on his clothes as he said, "Friend! Don't mention this marriage again! I think my life will ultimately be ruined by it!" Seeing him say this, Anfa became serious and sat down on the edge of the bed, slowly trying to persuade him, "Let's not talk about the past! You're already relatives anyway!" Jucai said, "Too much bullying! You didn't see the little son-of-a-bitch's attitude -- his face all sunken in: 'What? You still want to discuss it with your family? Don't be wishy-washy! You can ask for more things, but there's no room for discussion on anything else! I'm telling you honestly: It's already showing you respect that people like us are willing to be related to people like you! If you don't know how to appreciate it, don't regret it if something happens in the future!' You've lived for thirty or forty years, have you ever seen such a ruthless matchmaker?" Anfa said, "What's the point of talking about him? Who doesn't know that the little son-of-a-bitch relies on his master's power?" Jucai said, "Let's talk about the Liu family. Do we still want to be favored by them? I followed my father to Xiahe to reclaim wasteland in the second year of the Republic of China. I was only twenty years old then, and Jincai was only eighteen. When the Liu family, big and small, saw my brothers, they all said, 'Where did these two beggar children come from?' The year I married your sister, I owed them ten or so silver dollars. The interest wasn't enough to pay, and the principal grew bigger every year until your sister gave birth to Jinsheng. Jinsheng grew to be twelve years old and herded cows for them for a few years before we finally paid off the debt. Haven't we seen enough of their faces? Still expecting them to show us respect?" Anfa said, "You were still pretty good! Don't you remember that I owed them twenty silver dollars, and the interest kept accumulating until I had to give them five acres of land as good as dead? Otherwise, how could my life be so hard? Sigh! What's the point of mentioning those things? Now they're still so ruthless, whoever they find is just out of luck. Things have already turned out like this, we can only resign ourselves to fate. What's the use of getting angry over nothing?"...

    Jinsheng's wife led Anfa's wife and Gougou into the east room and saw Ruan Ying lying with her face to the wall. Jinsheng's wife said, "Sister! Don't cry! See who's here?" Ruan Ying had already heard that it was her aunt, but she just couldn't stop crying. When she saw her aunt come in, she had to wipe away her tears and get up, saying, "Aunt! Please sit down! Aunt! Look, I'm seventeen years old, and what kind of result have I gotten?" Anfa's wife said, "Little child, what are you saying? It's not even set in stone yet, why are you already talking about a 'result'? Marriage is destined by fate, there can't be any mistakes. Besides, people don't have foresight. What seems unsatisfactory now might be a blessing in the future. Life is long, who can say for sure what kind of result they'll get in the future?" Jucai's wife also followed into the east room, saying, "Her aunt! Please give Ruan Ying a good talking to! I've been worried to death these past few days. Ever since Little Dan came to propose marriage on the third day of the month, she's been crying and crying, all the way until now! Do parents want to harm their daughters? Do your brother-in-law and I want to climb the Liu family's high social ladder? Heavens! Once Liu Xiyuan opens his mouth, plus a matchmaker like Little Dan, think about it! Could we say we didn't want to?"... Gougou saw that they were only talking about serious matters and ran outside to play.

    In the east room and the north room, they were talking lively, when suddenly they heard Jinsheng say in the courtyard, "Second aunt is here? Did you walk? Didn't ride a donkey?" Second aunt said in a low voice, "There are Japanese devils here, who would dare to ride a donkey?" When they heard that second aunt had arrived, everyone except Ruan Ying, who hadn't stopped crying, came out of the east room and the north room to greet her. Some called her second aunt, some called her second sister, some called her second younger sister. Everyone shouted for a while and then went to the north room to talk together. When Gougou saw that second aunt had arrived, he ran back and asked, "Second aunt! Did you bring me peanuts?" Second aunt said, "Look how Gougou remembers things? It's been two years and you still remember? The peanuts haven't been dug up yet, I'll bring them to you when they are!" When Gougou heard that there were no peanuts, he ran out again. Anfa said, "It's been two years since second sister has been here!" Jucai's wife said, "Isn't it? She only came once when Jinsheng got married the year before last, and hasn't come since!" Second aunt said, "Shanghe and Xiahe are only fifteen miles apart, but it's not easy to come! First, I don't have time, and second..." she suddenly lowered her voice, "second, there are Japanese devils here, who knows what might happen if you're unlucky?" Anfa's wife said, "Well, that's just 'a temporary vacancy in the mountains'!" (A superstitious saying used where there are many wolves, meaning that you're not afraid of many wolves as long as you don't run into them.) "There are Japanese devils here, but aren't there Eighth Route Armies in your Shanghe? Isn't it the same?" Second aunt said, "That's different! The Eighth Route Army doesn't act recklessly. In Shanghe, if you raise livestock, you only pay the corvee labor that you're supposed to pay. It's not like here, where you're pulled into corvee labor on the road?" Anfa's wife said, "I'm not sure about that! Haven't you heard that the Eighth Route Army kills people everywhere and carries out struggles everywhere? How can you say they don't act recklessly?" Jinsheng said, "That's all the Liu Xiyuan gang's nonsense! Haven't you heard what my second uncle said? The struggles are against bullies, traitors, and landlords, people like our village's Liu Xiyuan!" Second aunt said, "That's right! That's right! Five families were struggled against in Shanghe. The first family was called Ma Yuanzheng, Liu Xiyuan's cousin. The other four households were also about the same as Ma Yuanzheng. They used to eat and bite people in the village. In July, the district came to mobilize the struggle, and called on the villagers to settle old scores with them, almost wiping out their family property! The struggle is against those people. In my opinion, it should be! Who told them to be so domineering before?" Jinsheng's wife said, "Can't the Eighth Route Army come and kill the devils in our Xiahe and pull Liu Xiyuan out for a struggle?" Second aunt asked, "Is Liu Xiyuan still so domineering now?" Jucai said, "Could he have forced our daughter to marry him if he wasn't so domineering?" Second aunt said, "I wanted to ask a long time ago but it wasn't easy to bring up. I've been thinking about it: Why did elder sister find a man like Liu Zhong for Ruan Ying? He already has a twelve or thirteen-year-old child from his previous marriage, what should they call our Ruan Ying? Do you only care about marrying into a good family and not care about the person? Hearing what brother-in-law said, it turns out it was forced, then what's there to say?" Jucai's wife said, "Look, second sister! Is there any need to ask? If it wasn't forced, would I deliberately send my daughter to his Liu family?" As she spoke, she began to cry. Second aunt said, "Elder sister! Take it easy! You've already made the promise, what's the use of regretting it? We can only blame our Ruan Ying for being too pretty. If she looked like Scarface Lian from the Gao Lou courtyard, or Blind Xiu from the bottom of the back cliff, you wouldn't have these problems." Anfa's wife said, "People don't have foresight. If we had known there would be these troubles, wouldn't we have found a family for our daughter and sent her off earlier?" Jucai's wife said, "It's your brother-in-law who was indecisive and delayed things. Last year, Xiao Bao's mother from the Huai Shu courtyard asked Yuan Hai to propose marriage, but your brother-in-law thought their family didn't have much..." When Jucai heard his wife bring this up, he got angry. He said, "Don't talk about this anymore, okay? Can't you blame this on me?" Seeing that he was angry, everyone tried to persuade him, but he was still sulking and went to sleep in the inner room. Anfa followed him in, chatted with him, and tried to calm him down. Outside, Jinsheng's wife was already busy starting a fire in the yard, leaving only the three women. Jucai's wife said quietly, "Look at your brother-in-law's temper! It's clearly him who delayed things, and he doesn't want to be told about it! I think it would have been good to marry Xiao Bao from the Huai Shu courtyard!" Anfa's wife said, "The child is a good child, both capable and good-looking, but I don't blame elder brother-in-law for being picky, their family just doesn't have much." Jucai's wife said, "When our Jinsheng herded cows for the Liu family, Xiao Bao was also a handyman for the Liu family, and the two children got along very well. Xiao Bao is more promising than my Jinsheng. Last year, at only eighteen, he could lead two pack mules for the Liu family. He's friends with our Jinsheng, and he often comes to our house when he's free, and he helps with the work and eats good food, solid as one of our own children." She said, pinching her throat even more, "This can only be said among us sisters: Our Ruan Ying has been playing and messing around with Xiao Bao since she was ten years old, and her little heart has long been on Xiao Bao. Last year, when Yuan Hai came to propose marriage, the little thing made a bowl of noodles for him, laughing and talking. Later, when she heard your brother-in-law say that the family didn't have much, she immediately pouted and mumbled, 'If they don't have much, they don't have much! Didn't my grandfather come from a famine?'..."

    Jucai's brothers Jincai, Jinsheng, and Old Guai stomped into the north room, interrupting the three women's gossip. Jincai looked at the table and said, "We're still short one. Jinsheng! You and Old Guai go to the west room in the back yard and carry my table over here!" Some carried tables, some borrowed furniture, and before they were fully prepared, the little dog ran back to report that the Liu family's gift boxes had already been carried out. Old Guai, Jincai, and Jinsheng went out to receive the gift boxes, and Anfa put on his blue cloth padded jacket to greet the matchmaker.

    The matchmaker was originally just Little Dan. The Liu family, because they wanted to conform to the old saying of "three matchmakers and six witnesses", pieced together two more people, one called Liu Xien and one called Liu Xiaosi, who were distant relatives of Liu Xiyuan. Yuan Hai, Liu Xiyuan's head hired hand, carried a load of gift boxes; the second hired hand, Xiao Chang, and Xiao Bao, who drove the pack mules, carried a large food box. Yuan Hai walked in front, followed by Xiao Bao, Xiao Chang, Xien, Xiaosi, and finally Little Dan. The six people walked in a line out of the Liu family's gate towards Jucai's house. Anfa's child, Gougou, and a group of children who weren't even wearing pants, had been running around at the entrance of the Liu family's house waiting to watch. When they saw the six people come out, they shouted, "They're coming out, they're coming out!" while running to Jucai's house to shout, "They're here! They're here!" Jinsheng and the others then went out to greet them.

    It's not known what kind of ceremony they were performing: they stood at the door first, wearing hats and bowing. Jincai and Jinsheng received the food boxes, Old Guai received the load, and Anfa led the three matchmakers, still lined up in a long string, into the house.

    The guests were divided into groups: Anfa accompanied the matchmakers to the north room, Jinsheng accompanied Yuan Hai, Xiao Chang, and Xiao Bao to the west room, and the women went to the east room. When Ruan Ying heard that the gifts had arrived, she hid in Jincai's west room in the back yard.

    Anfa was an honest man, who only knew how to speak a few farming words. He couldn't handle Little Dan, so he had to talk to Xien and Xiaosi about how much grain that plot of land yielded and what crops they planned to plant in that field. Little Dan felt that these words were boring and wanted to find a place to satisfy his opium addiction first. He went into the inner room and saw Jucai lying on the bed with a quilt over him. When Jucai saw him enter, he sat up and covered his chest, politely saying to him, "Brother! I'm really sorry today, I'm a little sick, I'm feeling very cold, I can't sit with you..." Little Dan saw that it wasn't a place to smoke opium, said, "It's okay, you lie down," and came out. He said to Anfa as if he was giving an order, "Anfa! Find me a place to get high first!" Anfa said, "The meal will be ready soon! Eat first?" Little Dan said, "I'm very casual about eating. Just bring me a bowl when the food is ready, I'd rather get high first!" Seeing him say this, Anfa agreed, walking to the door and calling out, "Jincai!" When Jincai came, he asked him, "Can Little Dan go to your backyard to get high?" Jincai also had to agree, and led Little Dan to the backyard. At this moment, they suddenly heard Jucai's wife shout in the east room, "Jincai, come here!" Jincai ran to the door of the east room, and Jucai's wife whispered in his ear, "Just let him go to your north room! Don't lead him to the west room, our Ruan Ying is hiding in your west room." Jincai nodded and led Little Dan away.

    With Little Dan gone, it was much easier to talk. Don't think that Xien and Xiaosi were relatives of Liu Xiyuan. When they talked about Liu Xiyuan's tyranny, they would often curse him a few times, but this time they were here as matchmakers for the Liu family. Although they also knew that this marriage was forced, they couldn't reveal the truth on the surface, so they didn't curse Liu Xiyuan, but treated Little Dan as Liu Xiyuan's scapegoat to curse. As soon as Little Dan went out, Xiaosi pointed at his back twice. Anfa and Xiyuan shook their heads, and then they started cursing in low voices, one saying "rotten to the core", the other saying "a great scourge"... They each told strange stories about Little Dan's extortion and deception, and talked all the way until it was time to eat.

    In the last room were all women, talking lively, but there was nothing serious -- talking about whose daughter was good, whose daughter-in-law was bad, they would giggle and laugh; talking about the Eighth Route Army leaders in Shanghe, the Japanese devils in Xiahe, they would be quiet and secretive.

    The conversation in the west room was a different story: Jinsheng asked, "Uncle Yuan Hai! How have you been living in the Liu family these past few years? Can you manage to make ends meet?" (Meaning, can you support your family?) Yuan Hai said, "Isn't it the same as when you were there? The principal of those twenty silver dollars can never be repaid. No matter what year it is, if you calculate the wages, after deducting the borrowed grain, it's only enough to pay the interest. -- Ah! Look how confused I am? You two families have already become relatives..." Jinsheng said, "Damn it! Don't you know how this relationship was formed?" Xiao Bao said, "It doesn't matter! Isn't Brother Jinsheng one of us?" Xiao Chang said, "Who can get any advantage from living as a long-term worker for him? Anyway, he's the one who calculates the accounts! Jinsheng, do you remember? That year I was driving mules for him, and the mules ate three dollars worth of medicine, and he still deducted three dollars from my wages! What kind of reason is that? Power is the only reason!"...

    Everyone in the different rooms had been drinking water and chatting for a while, and it was almost time to eat. According to the custom here, when there was a wedding or funeral, the guests would eat two meals - the first meal was soup and noodles, and the second meal was a banquet. The first meal was served differently depending on whether the guests were strangers or acquaintances, ordinary guests or VIPs -- strangers and VIPs ate vermicelli, acquaintances and ordinary guests ate he lao noodles. Although the three matchmakers were all from the village, they were handling the affairs of a new relative, so they could only be considered strangers and were served vermicelli. Although Yuan Hai, Xiao Chang, and Xiao Bao were doing the same thing as the matchmakers, these three had already stated to Jinsheng that they didn't want to be treated as strangers and were willing to eat he lao noodles. The rest of the guests naturally had he lao noodles. Little Dan was smoking opium in the north room of the backyard, and Old Guai brought him a bowl of vermicelli.

    After eating the first meal, it was time to open the gift boxes. According to the custom here, the gift boxes didn't just contain edible things, all kinds of gifts could be packed -- according to tradition: the first layer contained jewelry and headwear, the second layer contained fine and coarse clothing, the third layer contained dragon and phoenix wedding cakes, and the fourth layer contained wine, meat, and rice. If it was a gift from wealthy people in a well-matched family, there could be two, three, or at most eight food boxes. If it was a gift from a poor family, some didn't use food boxes and only carried a pair of wooden boxes that were two feet square and a foot high, and some only used two baskets. Although the Liu family was a landlord family, since the bride's family was a peasant household and it was also a remarriage, they looked down on them a bit. But if it was too ordinary, it wouldn't be like the Liu family's style, so they carried a food box and a load of wooden boxes, making it neither too high nor too low. To open the food box, the matchmaker had to be invited to the front. Jucai's wife sent Old Guai to invite Little Dan, but Old Guai came back and said, "I can't invite him! He said it's fine as long as there are two people present!" Xien and Xiaosi said, "Then let's open it!" According to custom, incense had to be burned before opening the food box. Jinsheng, representing the host, burned the incense, and then opened it. After opening the food box, there would almost always be an argument. According to the custom here, the gifts were all requested by the bride's family on a list. When the groom's family received the bride's list, they almost always felt that too much was being asked for. When they sent the gifts, they would give some discounts. For example, if they asked for two pairs of earrings, they would only send one pair, if they asked for a five-tael bracelet, they would only give a three-tael bracelet. Naturally, there would be an argument when the gifts arrived. If the two families were not on good terms, the argument would be even more fierce. On the day the gifts were sent, the bride's family would invite female relatives such as aunts, aunts, and aunts to argue with the matchmaker. The matchmaker would try to avoid it if they could, and if they couldn't avoid it, they would say "I'll go back and ask your in-laws to make up for it," doing their best to delay until it passed.

    Because Jucai's family was unwilling to this marriage, they naturally asked for more things. Even if the Liu family didn't send anything, they wouldn't be afraid of Jucai changing his mind, but they didn't want to deliberately cause trouble. They had all the things themselves. After the bride was married into the family, they would all be brought back as they were, which wouldn't be a loss. Therefore, they sent the gifts in a presentable manner. For example, they asked for two pairs of gold earrings and two pairs of gold rings, and they gave a pair of gold and a pair of silver for each item, but they didn't give a gold bracelet, and gave a pair of gold-plated ones instead. There was no shortage of silk clothes, but they were all from Liu Zhong's previous wife, and they were a bit small for Ruan Ying to wear. Anyway, since the bride's family had grievances, they had to vent them. After looking at the jewelry and clothes, Jucai's wife said to Xiyuan and Xiaosi, "We haven't seen much of the world, so we can't say the clothes that the in-laws sent are bad, but it's a pity that our daughter is a bit fat and can't wear them. There aren't enough pieces of jewelry, and they're all old-fashioned from twenty years ago, not a single fashionable item. Please take them back and ask your in-laws to exchange them!" Although the words were very gentle, there was an underlying bite in them, and it couldn't be settled in just a few words. Xien was a bit older and could still say a few words, so he started from a distance. He said, "Sister-in-law Jucai! The families are already relatives, don't make that in-law too difficult. Think about it: Now that there's war and chaos, where can you buy so many new things? Naturally, you have to make do with what you have. This is just to put on a show, what are you afraid of our daughter wearing after she gets married? If something doesn't fit, our daughter is their daughter-in-law, can they let our daughter go out and embarrass them?" Before he finished speaking, second aunt interrupted. Second aunt said, "You're pushing it too far! His Liu family is also a rich family that can be counted within dozens of miles, can afford to marry a wife but can't afford to make clothes or buy jewelry? Can they get away with just using the things that dead ghost wife wore before?" Anfa's wife also said, "No! This is my niece's first important event in her life, she can't wear his old and worn things!" Jincai's wife held the gold-plated bracelet and said, "They only pick the bad old things to send! Who doesn't know that Liu Zhong's previous wife wore a six-tael gold bracelet? Why did they send this gold-plated one instead?" Jinsheng's wife also said, "They're really treating us like country bumpkins! They think we country bumpkins don't know gold and silver!" In fact, only those two women had seen gold jewelry, but they hadn't used it either, and they didn't really recognize it. But they saw that this pair of bracelets wasn't the pair that Liu Zhong's previous wife wore on her arm, and it was also old, with some places that seemed to be silvery, so they determined that it was gold-plated.

    Seeing that the situation was difficult to resolve, Xien and Xiaosi pushed it onto Little Dan. Xien said, "Originally, Little Dan handled the list of things to ask for, and how much he asked for and promised, we two don't know." Anfa said, "I opened the list, there's no mistake!" Xiaosi said, "Let's invite Little Dan over!" Jucai's wife said, "Invite him, then invite him! He's the one who said that it's okay to ask for more things, and it's not okay if we don't agree! Whether or not we agree to the marriage is no longer up to me, can't I even decide what to ask for? Otherwise, only Liu Xiyuan can live! Old Guai! Go to the backyard and invite Little Dan again!" Old Guai said, "I can't invite him!" Xiaosi said, "Xiao Bao! Go for a moment!" Xiao Bao went.

    Xiao Bao didn't know that Little Dan was in the north room. Jincai always lived in the west room, so he ran straight to the west room. He was about to call "Uncle Little Dan" when he suddenly saw Ruan Ying. Ruan Ying was lying with her face to the wall. Hearing someone walking loudly, she turned over and was about to get up when she saw that it was Xiao Bao. She then lay down again and said, "You? I thought it was someone else!" Xiao Bao said in a low voice, "Aunt asked me to find Little Dan!" Ruan Ying pointed with her mouth and said, "In the north room!" Xiao Bao turned around and was about to leave when Ruan Ying stopped him again, saying, "Come here later, I want to say something to you!" Xiao Bao nodded and went to the north room to call Little Dan. By this time, Little Dan had already smoked enough opium. Seeing that Xiao Bao said there was something outside that needed him, he mumbled, "Women are really troublesome! Even if we argue for a while, isn't it going to be the same thing?" Saying that, he walked out. When the women saw him come out, they argued with him again about the clothes and jewelry not being suitable. He agreed very simply. He said, "Forget it! You're all saying useless things! Which family doesn't argue when they send gifts? Which family can argue so much that they carry the things back? No matter what you say, it's useless, the daughter is already married to their family!" Jucai's wife said, "You say that's naturally not right! According to that..." Little Dan was already impatient and didn't listen anymore, rolling his eyes and saying, "If it's not right, do as you please! I'm only in charge up to here!" Jucai's wife said, "Oh Heavens! How can there be such a ruthless matchmaker in the world? Kill me with a knife!" Little Dan said, "Why would I kill you? If it's not right, go negotiate with the Liu family yourself! If I can't manage it, I can't manage it! I'm not in charge!" Saying that, he pushed everyone away and was about to leave, prompting Anfa to run in front and stretch out his arms to stop him. The other men also came over to say good things, and even Jucai draped his clothes over himself and came out tottering to ask what was going on.

    Everyone managed to persuade Little Dan to stay, and it was already noon. Jinsheng's uncle urged them to start the banquet, and Old Guai started putting dishes on each table. Before long, everything was ready, the guests were all seated, and when they counted the people, Xiao Bao was missing. Jinsheng ran around shouting, and Xiao Bao finally ran out from the backyard.

    It turned out that after Xiao Bao called Little Dan out, he went to see Ruan Ying in the west room in the backyard again. Xiao Bao asked Ruan Ying what she wanted to say, and Ruan Ying said, "Wait a minute! Let me think!" Then she started counting on her fingers. She counted and thought, thought and counted again. Xiao Bao anxiously asked, "What are you counting?" She said, "Don't mess with me!" She counted for a while and said, "There are twenty-seven days left!" Xiao Bao said, "Twenty-seven days to do what?" She said, "Don't you know? September 13th!" Xiao Bao suddenly remembered that the Liu family had decided to marry her on September 13th, and agreed, "I know! From August 15th to September 13th, there are twenty-nine days left!" Ruan Ying said, "Today is almost over, it can't be counted as a day. August is a small month, and subtract one more day..." Xiao Bao said, "No matter how many days, what do you say?" Ruan Ying said, "What do I say! What do you say?" Xiao Bao couldn't answer. The two looked at each other face to face for a long time, neither saying anything. Suddenly, Ruan Ying sang in a low voice like a song, "Brother Bao! There are twenty-seven days left!" As she sang, tears rolled down her cheeks! Xiao Bao kept trying to persuade her, but Ruan Ying just cried. At this moment, Jinsheng was shouting outside, "Xiao Bao! Xiao Bao!" At this time, Xiao Bao felt two streams of hot tears on his face as well. He quickly wiped them away, but the more he wiped, the more they flowed. He wiped for a long time, but he didn't know if he had wiped them dry, because they were calling so urgently from outside, so he had to run out.

    After the banquet, the guests were about to leave after a short break. When he was about to leave, Little Dan lectured as he walked, "What else is there to say about the Liu family's scene? Don't be dissatisfied in the future..." Anfa saw the guests off, enduring Little Dan's lecture for Jucai, and only after seeing them off at the gate and bowing did it end.

    Xiao Bao carried the food box, his head lowered, and all the way he was just guessing what would happen twenty-seven days later.

　　邪不压正
    一　“太欺人呀！”
    一九四三年旧历中秋节，下河村王聚财的闺女软英，跟本村刘锡元的儿子刘忠订了婚，刘家就在这一天给聚财家送礼。聚财在头一天，就从上河村请他的连襟来给媒人做酒席，忙了一天，才准备了个差不多。
    十五这天，聚财因为心里有些不痛快，起得晚一点。他还没有起来，就听得院里有人说：“恭禧恭禧！我来帮忙！”他一听就听出是本村的穷人老拐。
    这老拐虽是个穷人，人可不差，不偷人不讹诈，谁家有了红白大事（娶亲、出丧），合得来就帮个忙，吃顿饭，要些剩余馍菜；合不来就是饿着肚子也不去。象聚财的亲家刘锡元，是方圆二十里内有名大财主，他偏不到他那里去；聚财不过是个普通庄户人家，他偏要到他这里来。他来了，说了几句吉利话，就扫院子、担水，踏踏实实做起活来了。
    聚财又睡了一小会，又听他老婆在院里说：“安发！你早早就过来了？他妗母也来了？——金生！快接住你妗母的篮子！——安发！姐姐又不是旁人！你也是凄凄皇皇地，贵巴巴买那些做甚？——狗狗！来大姑看你吃胖了没有？这两天怎么不来大姑家里吃枣？——你姐夫身上有点不得劲，这时候了还没有起来！金生媳妇！且领你妗母到东屋里坐吧！——金生爹！快起来吧！客人都来了！”聚财听见是自己的小舅子两口，平常熟惯了，也没有立刻起来，只叫了声：“安发！来里边坐来吧！”安发老婆跟金生媳妇进了东房，安发就到聚财的北房里来。
    这地方的风俗，姐夫小舅子见了面，总好说句打趣的话。安发一进门就对着聚财说：“这时候还不起！才跟刘家结了亲，刘锡元那股舒服劲，你倒学会了？”聚财坐起来，一面披衣服，一面说：“伙计！再不要提这门亲事！我看我的命终究要送到这上头！”安发见他这么说，也就正经起来，坐到床边慢慢劝他说：“以前的事不提他吧！好歹已经成了亲戚了！”聚财说：“太欺人呀？你是没有见人家小旦那股劲——把那脸一洼：“怎么？你还要跟家里商量？不要三心二意了吧！东西可以多要一点，别的没有商量头！老实跟你说：人家愿意跟你这种人家结亲，总算看起你来了！为人要不识抬举，以后出了什么事，你可不要后悔！”你也活了三四十岁，你见过这样利害的媒人？”安发说：“说他做甚？谁还不知道小旦那狗仗人势？”聚财说：“就说刘家吧，咱还想受他那抬举？我从民国二年跟着我爹到下河来开荒，那时候我才二十，进财才十八，人家刘家大小人见了我弟兄们，都说“那来这两个讨吃孩子？”我娶你姐那一年，使了人家十来块钱，年年上利上不足，本钱一年比一年滚得大，直到你姐生了金生，金生长到十二，又给人家放了几年牛，才算把这笔帐还清。他家的脸色咱还没有看够？还指望他抬举抬举？”安发说：“你那还算不错！你不记得我使人家那二十块钱，后来利上滚利还不起，末了不是找死给人家五亩地？要不我这日子能过得这么紧？唉！还提那些做甚？如今人家还是那么利害，找到谁头上还不是该谁霉气？事情已经弄成这样，只好听天由命，生那些闲气有什么用？”……
    金生媳妇领着安发老婆和狗狗进了东房，见软英脸朝着墙躺着。金生媳妇说：“妹妹！不要哭了！你看谁来了？”软英早就听得是她妗子，只是擦不干眼泪，见她妗子走进去了，她只得一面擦着泪一面起来说：“妗妗！你快坐下！妗妗！你看我长了十七岁了，落了个什么结果？”安发老婆说：“小小孩子说得叫甚？八字还没有见一撇，怎么就叫个“结果”？该是因缘由天定，那里还有错了的？再说啦，人没有前后眼，眼前觉着不如意，将来还许是福，一辈子日子长着哩，谁能早早断定谁将来要得个什么结果？”聚财老婆也跟到东房里来，她说：“他妗妗！你好好给我劝一劝软英！这几天愁死我了：自从初三那天小旦来提亲，人家就哭哭哭，一直哭到如今！难道当爹娘的还有心害闺女？难道我跟你姐夫愿意攀人家刘家的高门？老天爷！人家刘锡元一张开嘴，再加上小旦那么个媒人，你想！咱说不愿意能行？”………狗狗见她们只谈正经话，就跑到外边去玩。
    东房里、北房里，正说着热闹，忽听得金生在院里说：“二姨来了？走着来的？没有骑驴？”二姨低低地说：“这里有鬼子，谁敢骑驴？”听说二姨来了，除了软英还没有止住哭，其余东房里北房里的人都迎出来。他们有的叫二姨，有的叫二姐，有的叫二妹；大家乱叫了一阵，一同到北房里说话。狗狗见二姨来了，跑回来问：“二姑！给我拿着落花生没有？”二姨说：“看我狗狗多么记事？二年了你还记着啦？花生还没有刨，等刨了再给你拿！”狗狗听说没花生，又跑出去了。安发说：“二姐二年了还没有来过啦！”聚财老婆说：“可不是？自从前年金生娶媳妇来了一回，以后就还没有来！”二姨说：“上河下河只隔十五里，来一遭真不容易！一来没有工夫，二来”她忽然把嗓音放低“二来这里还有鬼子，运气不对了谁知道要出什么事情？”安发老婆说：“那也是‘山走一时空’吧（狼多的地方好说这句迷信话，意思就是说不怕狼多，只要你不碰上就行）！这里有日本鬼，你们上河不是有八路军？那还不一样？”二姨说：“那可不同！八路又不胡来。在上河，喂个牲口，该着支差才支差，那象你们这里在路上拉差？”安发老婆说：“这我可不清楚了！听说八路军不是到处杀人、到处乱斗争？怎么又说他不胡来？”金生说：“那都是刘锡元那伙人放的屁！你没听二姨夫说过？斗争斗的是恶霸、汉奸、地主，那些人都跟咱村的刘锡元一样！”二姨说：“对了对了！上河斗了五家，第一家叫马元正，就是刘锡元的表弟，还有那四户也都跟马元正差不多，从前在村里都是吃人咬人的。七月里区上来发动斗争，叫村里人跟他们算老帐，差不多把他们的家产算光了！斗争就是斗那些人。依我说也应该！谁叫他们从前那么霸气？”金生媳妇说：“八路军就不能来把咱下河的鬼子杀了，把刘锡元拉住斗争斗争？”二姨问：“刘锡元如今还是那么霸气？”聚财说：“不是那么霸气，就能硬逼住咱闺女许给人家？”二姨说：“我早就想问又不好开口。我左思右想：大姐为什么给软英找下刘忠那么个男人？人家前房的孩子已经十二三了，可该叫咱软英个什么？难道光攀好家就不论人？听大姐夫这么一说，原来是强逼成的，那还说什么？”聚财老婆说：“你看二妹！这还用问？要不是强逼，我还能故意把闺女往他刘家送？”说着说着就哭起来。二姨说：“大姐！心放宽点吧！话已经跟人家展直了，后悔还有什么用处？只怨咱软英长得太俊，要象高楼院疤莲，后崖底瞎秀，管保也没有这些事情。”安发老婆说：“人没前后眼。早知道有这些麻烦，咱不会早给咱闺女找个家打发出去？”聚财老婆说：“生是你姐夫三心二意把事情耽搁了：去年人家槐树院小宝他娘，央着元孩来提，你姐夫嫌人家家里没甚………”聚财一听他老婆说起这个就要生气。他说：“再不要说这个吧？这个事算坏到我一个人手行不行？”大家见他生了气，都劝了他几句，他仍然赌气到套间里去睡。安发跟着他走进去，跟他拉着闲话，给他平气。外间里，金生媳妇早忙着去院里烧火，只留下三个老婆。聚财老婆悄悄说：“看你姐夫那脾气！明明是他耽误了事，还不愿意叫人说着！我看嫁给人家槐树院小宝也不错！”安发老婆说：“孩子倒是个好孩子，又精干又漂亮，不过也不怨大姐夫挑眼儿，家里也就是没甚。”聚财老婆说：“咱金生在刘家放牛那几年，人家小宝也在刘家打杂，两个孩子很合得来。人家小宝比我金生有出息，前年才十八，就能给刘家赶两个驮骡。人家跟咱金生是朋友，闲了常好到咱家里来，碰着活也做，碰着好饭也吃，踏踏实实，跟咱自己个孩子一样。”她说到这里，更把嗓子捏住些说：“这话只能咱姐妹们说：咱软英从十来岁就跟小宝在一块打打闹闹很熟惯，小心事早就在小宝身上。去年元孩来提媒，小东西有说有笑给人家做了顿拉面，后来一听你姐夫说人家没甚，马上就噘了噘嘴嘟噜着说：“没甚就没甚吧！我爷爷不是逃荒来的？“……”
    聚财的兄弟进财、金生、老拐，踢踢踏踏都到北屋里来，把三个老婆的闲话打断。进财看了看桌子说：“还短一张。金生！你跟老拐去后院西房抬我那张桌子来！”他们抬桌子的抬桌子，借家具的借家具，还没有十分准备妥当，小狗就跑回来报信，说刘家的送礼食盒，已经抬出来了。老拐、进财、金生都出去接食盒，安发穿起他的蓝布大夹袄去迎媒人。
    媒人原来只是小旦一个人，刘家因为想合乎三媒六证那句古话，又拼凑了两个人，一个叫刘锡恩，一个叫刘小四，是刘锡元两个远门本家。刘锡元的大长工元孩，挑着一担礼物盒子；二长工小昌和赶驮骡的小宝抬着一架大食盒。元孩走在前边，小宝、小昌、锡恩、小四，最后是小旦，六个人排成一行，走出刘家的大门往聚财家里来。安发的孩子狗狗，和另外一群连裤子也不穿的孩子们，早就在刘家的大门口跑来跑去等着看，见他们六个人一出来，就乱喊着“出来了出来了”，一边喊一边跑，跑到聚财家里喊：“来了！来了！”金生他们这才迎出去。
    不知道他们行的算什么礼：到门口先站齐，戴着礼帽作揖。进财和金生接住食盒，老拐接住担子，安发领着三个媒人，仍然排成一长串子走进去。
    客人分了班：安发陪着媒人到北房，金生陪着元孩、小昌、小宝到西房，女人们到东房，软英一听说送礼的来了，早躲到后院里进财的西房里去。
    安发是个老实人，只会说几句庄稼话，跟小旦应酬不来，只好跟锡恩小四两个人谈谈那块谷子打了多少，那块地里准备种麦子。小旦觉着这些话听来没趣味，想找个地方先过一过烟瘾。他走进套间里去，见聚财搭着个被子躺在床上。聚财见他进去，坐起来掩了掩怀，很客气地向他说：“老弟！我今天实在对不起，有点小病，身上冷得不行，不能陪你们坐坐………”小旦看见不是个抽大烟地方，说了句“没关系，你躺着吧”，就出来了。他好象下命令一样跟安发说：“安发！先给我找个过瘾地方！”安发说：“饭快了！先吃饭吧？”小旦说：“我这吃饭很扯淡，饭成了给我端一碗就行，还是先过过瘾！”安发见他这么说，就答应他说：“可以！”随着走到门边喊：“进财！”进财来了，他问进财说：“叫小旦哥到你后院里过瘾吧？”进财也只得答应着，领着小旦往后院走。这时候，忽然又听得聚财老婆在东房里喊：“进财你来！”进财又跑到东房门边，聚财老婆对住他的耳朵说：“就叫他到你北房里吧！可不要领到西房里去，咱软英躲在你西房里。”进财点了点头，领着小旦去了。
    小旦走了，说话方便得多。你不要看锡恩和小四两个人是刘锡元的本家，说起刘锡元的横行霸道来他们也常好骂几句，不过这回是来给刘家当媒人，虽然也知道这门亲事是逼成的，表面上也不能戳破底，因此谁也不骂刘锡元，只把小旦当成刘锡元个替死鬼来骂。小旦一出门，小四对着他的脊背指了两下，安发和锡元摇了摇头，随后你一言我一语，小声小气骂起来——这个说“坏透了”，那个说“一大害”………各人又都说了些小旦讹人骗人的奇怪故事，一直谈到开饭。
    末房里都是几个女人，谈得很热闹，可没有什么正经话——说起谁家闺女好、谁家媳妇坏，就嘻嘻哈哈地；说起上河八路军长、下河鬼子短，就悄悄密密地。
    西房谈的另是一套：金生问：“元孩叔！你这几年在刘家住得怎么样？顾住顾不住（就是说能顾了家不能）？”元孩说：“还不跟你在那里那时候一样？那二十块现洋的本钱永远还不起，不论那一年，算一算工钱，除还了借粮只够纳利。——嗳！你看我糊涂不糊涂？你两家已经成了亲戚………”金生说：“他妈那×！你还不知道这亲戚是怎么结成的？”小宝说：“没关系！金生哥还不是自己人？”小昌说：“谁给他住长工还讨得了他的便宜？反正帐是由人家算啦！金生你记得吧：那年我给他赶骡，骡子吃了三块钱药，不是还硬扣了我三块工钱？说什么理？势力就是理！”………
    各个房里的人都喝着水谈了一会闲散话，就要开饭了。这地方的风俗，遇了红白大事，客人都吃两顿饭——第一顿是汤饭，第二顿是酒席。第一顿饭，待生客和待熟客不同，待粗客和待细客不同——生客细客吃挂面，熟客粗客吃河落。三个媒人虽然都是本村人，办的可是新亲戚的事，只能算生客，上的是挂面。元孩小昌小宝虽然跟媒人办的是一件事，可是这三个人早已跟金生声明不要按生客待，情愿吃河落。其余的客人，自然都是河落了。小旦在后院北屋里吸大烟，老拐给他送了一碗挂面。
    吃过第一顿饭以后就该开食盒。这地方的风俗，送礼的食盒，不只光装能吃的东西，什么礼物都可以装——按习惯：第一层装是首饰冠戴，第二层是粗细衣服，第三层是龙凤喜饼，第四层是酒、肉、大米。要是门当户对的地方豪绅们送礼，东西多了，可以用两架三架最多到八架食盒。要是贫寒人家送礼，也有不用食盒只挑一对二尺见方尺把高的木头盒子的，也有只用两个篮子的。刘家虽是家地主，一来女家是个庄稼户，二来还是个续婚，就有点轻看，可是要太平常了又觉有点不象刘家的气派，因此抬了一架食盒，又挑了一担木头盒子，弄了个不上不下。开食盒先得把媒人请到跟前。聚财老婆打发老拐去请小旦，老拐回来说：“请不动！他说有两个人在场就行！”锡恩和小四说“那就开吧！”按习惯，开食盒得先烧香。金生代表主人烧过了香，就开了。开了食盒，差不多总要吵架。这地方的风俗，礼物都是女家开着单子要的。男家接到女家的单子，差不多都嫌要得多，给送的时候，要打些折扣。比方要两对耳环只送一对，要五两重手镯只给三两重的，送来了自然要争吵一会，两家亲家要有点心事不对头，争吵得就更会凶一点。女家在送礼这一天请来了些姑姑姨姨妗妗一类女人们，就是叫她们来跟媒人吵一会。做媒人的，推得过就推，推不过就说“回去叫你亲家给补”，做好做歹，拖一拖就过去了。
    聚财家因为对这门亲事不情愿，要的东西自然多一点。刘家就是一件东西也不送，自然也不怕聚财改口，可是他也不愿意故意闹这些气——东西自己都有，送得去将来把媳妇娶到手，一件一件又都原封带回来了，不是个赔钱事，因此也送得很象个样子。象要了两对金耳环两对金戒指，每样都给了一对金的一对银的，只有金手镯没有给，给了一对镀金的。绸缎衣服一件也不少，不过都是刘忠前一个老婆的，要给软英穿，都窄小一点。不论好歹吧，女家既然有气，就要发作发作：聚财老婆看罢了首饰和衣服，就向锡元和小四说：“亲家给送的这些衣服，咱也没见过大市面，不敢说不好，可惜咱闺女长得粗胖一些，穿不上。首饰的件数也不够，样子也都是前二十年的老样，没有一件时行货。麻烦你们拿回去叫亲家给换换！”话虽然很和软，可是里边有骨头，不是三言五句能说了的事。锡恩岁数大一点，还能说几句，就从远处开了口。他说：“聚财嫂！亲戚已经成亲戚了，不要叫那一头亲戚太作难。你想：如今兵慌马乱的，上那里买那么多新东西？自然是有甚算甚。这不过是摆一摆排场吧，咱闺女以后过了门，穿戴着什么你怕没有啦？那件不合适，咱家的闺女就是他家的媳妇，他能叫咱闺女穿戴出去丢他的人？……”他还没有说完二姨就接上话。二姨说：“你推得可倒不近！他刘家也是方圆几十里数得着的大财主，娶得起媳妇就做不起衣裳、买不起首饰？就凭以前那死鬼媳妇穿戴过的东西顶数啦？”安发老婆也接着说：“不行！我外甥女儿一辈子头一场事，不能穿戴他那破旧东西！”进财老婆拿着镀金镯子说：“旧东西也只挑坏的送！谁不知道刘忠前一个老婆带着六两重的金镯子？为什么偏送这镀金的？”金生媳妇也说：“这真是捉土包子啦！他觉着我们这些土包子没有认得金银的！”其实这几个女人们还只有她们两个见过金首饰，不过也没有用过，也不见得真认得，只是见这对镯子不是刘忠前一个老婆胳膊上那一对，并且也旧了，有些地方似乎白白地露出银来，因此才断定是镀货。
    锡恩和小四看见事情不好下台，就往小旦身上推。锡恩说：“原来开单子要东西，都是小旦一手办的，要了多少，应承了多少，我两人都也摸不清楚。”安发说：“单是我开的，那倒没有错！”小四说：“还是请人家小旦来吧！”聚财老婆说：“请他就请他！就是他说多要点东西行，不答应就不行！许亲不许亲已经不由我了，要东西还不叫由我，那样只有他刘锡元活的了！老拐！你再到后院里请小旦来！”老拐说：“咱请不动！”小四说：“小宝！你去一下吧！”小宝就去了。
    小宝不知道小旦在北房，进财一向就在西房住，因此他就一直跑到西房里来。他正去叫“小旦叔”，忽然看见是软英。软英脸朝墙躺着，听见有人走得响，一翻身正要往起爬，看见是小宝，就又躺下去，说了声：“你？我当是谁来！”小宝低声说：“婶婶叫我找小旦！”软英用嘴指着说：“在北房里！”小宝扭转头正往外走，软英又叫住他说：“一会你来，我跟你说句话！”小宝点了点头就去北房叫小旦。这时候，小旦的大烟已经抽足了，见小宝说外头有事，非要他不行，他就嘟嘟念念说：“女人们真能麻烦！再吵一会还不是那么回事？”说着就走出来了。女人们见他出来了，又把刚才说衣服首饰不合适那番话对着他吵了一遍，他倒答应得很简单。他说：“算了！你们都说是没用话！那家送礼能不吵？那家送礼能吵得把东西抬回去？说什么都不抵事，闺女已经是嫁给人家了！”聚财老婆说：“你说那个天生不行！照那样说……”小旦已经不耐烦了，再不往下听，把眼一翻说：“不行你随便！我就只管到这里！”聚财老婆说：“老天爷呀！世上那有这么利害的媒人？你拿把刀来把我杀了吧！”小旦说：“我杀你做什么？行不行你亲自去跟刘家交涉！管不了不许我不管？不管了！”说着推开大家就往外走，急得安发跑到前边伸开两条胳膊拦住，别的男人们也都凑过来说好话，连聚财也披起衣服一摇一晃出来探问是什么事。
    大家好歹把小旦劝住，天已经晌午了。金生他姨夫催开席，老拐就往各桌上摆碟子。不多一会，都准备妥当，客人都坐齐，点了点人，只短小宝，金生跑来跑去喊叫，小宝才从后院里跑出来。
    原来小宝把小旦叫出来以后，就又到后院西房去看软英。小宝问软英要说什么，软英说：“你等等！我先想想！”随后就用指头数起来。她数一数想一想，想一想又数一数，小宝急着问：“你尽管数什么？”她说：“不要乱！”她又数了一会说：“还有二十七天！”小宝说：“二十七天做什么？”她说：“你不知道？九月十三！”小宝猛然想起来刘家决定在九月十三娶她，就答应她说：“我知道！八月十五到九月十三，还有二十九天！”软英说：“今天快完了，不能算一天。八月是小建，再除了一天……”小宝说：“不论几天吧，你说怎么样？”软英说：“我说怎么样！你说怎么样？”小宝没法答应。两个人脸对脸看了一大会，谁也不说什么。忽然软英跟唱歌一样低低唱道：“宝哥呀！还有二十七天呀！”唱着唱着，眼泪骨碌碌就流下来了！小宝一直劝，软英只是哭。就在这时候，金生在外边喊叫“小宝！小宝！”小宝这时才觉着自己脸上也有热热地两道泪，赶紧擦，赶紧擦，可是越擦越流，擦了很大一会，也不知擦干了没有，因为外边叫得紧，也只得往外跑。
    吃过酒席稍停了一会，客人就要回去。临去的时候，小旦一边走一边训话：“刘家的场面还有什么说的？以后再不要不知足……”安发一边送着客，一边替聚财受训，送到大门外作了揖才算完结。
    小宝抬着食盒低着头，一路上只是胡猜想二十七天以后的事。
