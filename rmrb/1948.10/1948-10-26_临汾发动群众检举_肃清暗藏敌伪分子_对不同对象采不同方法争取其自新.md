Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 24th. The Linfen Democratic Government has mobilized the masses to expose and report enemy and puppet personnel and to search for and seize weapons, achieving great results. Linfen was once the counter-revolutionary center of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan in southern Shanxi. After the area was liberated, the democratic government issued a proclamation prohibiting the activities of reactionary organizations such as the Kuomintang San Min Youth League and the Comrade Society, and set a deadline for registration and surrender of weapons and documents of reactionary organizations. However, some members of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan reactionary organizations continued to operate secretly in violation of government decrees and refused to register with the democratic government. The government then mobilized the masses to expose and report them. In the latter half of August, in the three administrative villages of Zhuncun, Diancun, and Jinquan, 120 enemy and puppet personnel registered and repented after being exposed by the masses, surrendering more than 30 rifles and pistols, more than 20 hand grenades, and a large number of enemy and puppet documents and materials. In the recent month, Lanhua Natural Village in the Seventh District exposed 30 enemy and puppet personnel, seized 10 rifles and pistols, and a large number of bullets and hand grenades, completely destroying the hidden enemy and puppet organization in the village. The work experience in the area is: mobilizing the masses to expose and report is an effective way to eliminate hidden enemy and puppet personnel, organizations, and to search for and seize weapons. This is because the local masses are not only familiar with the personal and family situations of the enemy and puppet personnel, but also with their social relations; they even know very well how many guns the enemy and puppet personnel have, what kind of guns they are, and where they are placed. After the masses are mobilized, they adopt different methods for different targets to win them over for self-renewal. To this end, the above-mentioned villages organized poor peasant and hired laborer groups and resident groups, united the masses of the whole village to organize security committees, and persuaded enemy and puppet personnel to register themselves through various relationships. A certain puppet personnel in Jinquan once resisted the exposure and reporting by the masses, saying, "Even if you cut me into a thousand pieces, I cannot hand over the gun," but after being persuaded by a friend who had already renewed himself, he handed over the gun. When mobilizing the masses to expose and report, the government must resolutely suppress the chief culprits. For example, the habitual bandit Bi Ruying, who was hiding in Lanhua Village, spread rumors and intimidated the masses, making them afraid to come forward to expose and report. The democratic government immediately arrested Bi and announced that those who did not register and surrender their guns would be resolutely suppressed. The masses then launched an exposure movement, reporting to the government one after another, causing all the bandits and puppet personnel to be caught.

　　临汾发动群众检举
  　肃清暗藏敌伪分子
  　对不同对象采不同方法争取其自新
    【新华社晋绥廿四日电】临汾民主政府发动群众检举敌伪人员及搜缴武器，获得很大成绩。临汾曾是蒋阎在晋南的反革命中心。该地解放后，民主政府即布告禁止国民党三青团同志会等反动组织活动，并限期登记交出武器及反动组织的文件。但若干蒋阎反动组织的分子仍违反政府法令，暗中继续活动，拒绝向民主政府登记。政府乃发动群众检举。准村、殿村、嘉泉等三行政村在八月下半月内即有敌伪人员一百二十名在群众检举下登记悔过，交出长短枪三十余支，手榴弹二十余枚及敌伪文件物资极多。七区兰村自然村在最近一月内检举出敌伪人员三十人，收缴长短枪十支及枪弹、手榴弹甚多，全部摧垮了该村暗藏的敌伪组织。该地工作经验是：发动群众检举，是肃清暗藏敌伪人员、组织及搜缴武器的有效办法。因当地群众不仅熟悉敌伪人员个人及其家庭情况，且熟悉其社会关系；甚至对敌伪人员有多少枪支、是什么枪、放在何处等都很清楚。群众发动后即针对不同对象，采取不同方法争取其自新。上述各村为此组织了贫雇小组和居民小组，团结全村群众组织治安委员会，通过各种关系劝说，使敌伪人员自己去登记。嘉泉某伪人员曾抗拒群众检举说：“把我千刀万剐了也交不出枪”，但是经他的一位已自新的朋友劝说后就交出了枪。在发动群众检举时，政府必须坚决镇压首恶分子。如兰村隐藏起来的惯匪毕汝英等大肆造谣恫吓群众，使群众不敢出头检举。民主政府即将毕逮捕，宣布不登记缴枪者坚决镇压。群众乃掀起检举运动，纷纷向政府告发，使全部匪伪人员落网。
