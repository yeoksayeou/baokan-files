Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Comprehensive report: "Those who still control France are beginning to think about this question: Has the time come to change the pieces? Wouldn't it be better to push the dictatorial General de Gaulle onto the stage and let the likes of Blum step aside now?" This is what Pravda correspondent Zhukov said in his report from Paris on the current political situation in France.

Since July 19, when the Schuman cabinet collapsed, France has experienced a succession of cabinet crises: the Marie cabinet, which succeeded the Popular Republican Schuman, fell on August 28, just one month after its formation; on August 30, Schuman, who had recently fallen, was again ordered to form a cabinet, and on September 2, he resigned, saying that he could not form a new cabinet; on September 5, he was again ordered and, after two days of struggling, barely managed to form a three-party cabinet including the Popular Republican Party, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Party, but 64 hours later, on September 7, it collapsed again. By September 11, the Radical Party's Queuille had formed a truly patchwork new cabinet (including eight right-wing parties of various sizes). Such frequent cabinet turnovers have not occurred in France in the three years since the war. The Soviet Labor Newspaper pointed out: "Three government crises in a month and a half are a manifestation of the increasingly deepening economic and political crisis brought to France by the pro-American clique's sinister policies."

The three cabinets that have already fallen have pursued a common policy, which is: to rely on American imperialism externally, and to attack the people's living standards internally, causing prices to soar, shortages of essential goods, and further currency inflation, thereby deepening France's economic crisis. During the two days that the Schuman government was in power, the price of bread per pound rose from 24 francs to 35 francs. In the three months before September 2, the amount of currency issued reached 100 billion francs. This has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the French people, especially the working masses. Thus, the reaction of the so-called "Third Force" of the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Party, and the Radical Party has been exposed, and the working masses of the "Workers' Force" faction of the Socialist Party and the Christian Workers' League of the Popular Republican Party are also increasingly disobeying the will of their upper-level leaders and participating in the wage increase demands and national independence movement led by the French Communist Party's General Confederation of Labor. In the past two months, strikes have broken out one after another in various places, and have become increasingly powerful, converging into a surging wave against the government's current policies. This is the fundamental reason for the fall of the three cabinets.

Under these circumstances, France's 200 families and American imperialism cannot but consider how much of the deceptive effect of the "Third Force" remains, and whether it is necessary to replace it with the naked fascism of de Gaulle. During the cabinet crisis, the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune openly stated that the Queuille government or any "Third Force" government could not succeed, and that only "de Gaulle could provide a very effective solution." De Gaulle himself was shouting everywhere at the time for a "new general election" and openly expressed his desire to return to power. The Queuille cabinet, which was formed on September 11, is different from the previous cabinets in that the Republican Party of Liberty and the Independent Socialist Party, which are closely related to de Gaulle, have all taken a hand in the cabinet. After Queuille took office, de Gaulle actively traveled and campaigned secretly in southern France, and met with Churchill, who was secretly conferring with Murphy, the American conspirator in Europe, in southern France at the time. Pravda correspondent Zhukov reported from Paris on the 20th: "The times are changing. It seems to the reactionaries across the ocean that yesterday it was still possible to use the rubber truncheon of the 'Third Force' to keep France obedient. Who knows if it will not be necessary to take out the naked steel knife of dictatorship for the same purpose now? Because the workers are resisting the encroachment of American and French trust with increasingly strong resistance."

Throughout the cabinet crisis, the French Communist Party has issued several calls, pointing out that the French people must have a democratic united government that defends independence and the interests of the working people. These calls have been supported by broad sections of the people, especially the working masses. A Soviet Labor Newspaper foreign affairs commentator said: "The traditional parliamentary groups cannot find a way out of the French economic and political crisis. Only a truly democratic government that wins the trust of the people and is therefore strong can lead France out of its predicament." Pravda commented: France's "domestic situation will become very tense; there will be a sharper struggle between the democratic forces that love France's glory, freedom, and independence and the reactionary forces that obey foreign orders and harm the interests of the French people."

　　法国形势将大为紧张
    亲美派的罪恶政策加深政治经济危机工人运动日益高涨三届内阁连续倒台反动派想叫独裁将军戴高乐公开上场
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合报导：“那些仍然控制着法国的人们正开始想着这样的问题：现在是否已到换棋子的时候呢？是否不如把独裁将军戴高乐推上台去而让勃鲁姆之流现在走开更好些呢？”这是真理报记者朱可夫自巴黎报导法国目前政局时所说的。
    自从七月十九日，舒曼内阁垮台以来，法国就连续发生了内阁危机：继人民共和党的舒曼而起的马利内阁，成立刚满一个月，就于八月二十八日宣布倒台；八月三十日，倒台不久的舒曼又受命组阁，九月二日曾即以无法组成新阁而呈辞；九月五日，他再度受命并经两天挣扎而勉强组成一个包括人民共和党、社会党、急进党的三党内阁，但六十四小时以后，即九月七日，又告倒台。至九月十一日，急进党的葛义才组成一个名符其实的七拼八凑的新阁（包括大小八个右翼政党）。象这样频繁的阁潮，在战后三年来的法国还没有过。苏联劳动报指出：“在一个半月期间发生三次政府危机，是亲美派的罪恶政策带给法国的日益深刻化的经济与政治危机的一个表现。”
    已经倒台的三届内阁所执行的是一个共同的政策，这就是：对外是投靠美帝国主义，对内是向人民的生活水平进攻，使物价飞涨、生活必需品奇缺、通货更加膨胀，从而使法国的经济危机深刻化。在舒曼政府执政的两天内，面包每磅价格已自二十四法郎涨至三十五法郎。在九月二日前之三个月内，通货发行量达一千亿法郎。这引起了法国人民，特别是工人群众的广泛不满，这样，所谓“第三种力量”的社会党、人民共和党、急进党的反动就原形毕露，社会党的“工人力量”派及人民共和党的基督教工人联盟的工人群众，也日益违背其上层领导分子的意志，而参加在法共领导下的总工会的增资要求和国家独立的运动。在过去两个月中，各地的罢工此伏彼起，并且愈来愈强大的汇合成反对政府现行政策的汹涌澎湃的浪潮。这是三届内阁倒台的根本原因。
    在这种情形下，法国的二百家和美帝国主义就不能不考虑“第三种力量”的欺骗作用究竟还剩多少，是否需要代之以赤裸裸的法西斯的戴高乐。在阁潮期间，纽约时报和纽约先驱论坛报即公开表示，葛义政府或任何“第三种力量”政府都不能成功，只有“戴高乐能够予以非常有效的解决”。戴高乐本人当时则到处叫喊要“重新大选”，并公开表示要重新上台。九月十一日成立的葛义内阁，其与前几届内阁不同的特点，在于和戴高乐有密切瓜葛的自由共和党、独立社会党等都在内阁中插了一脚。当葛义登台以后，戴高乐即积极地在南法旅行宣传秘密，并会见了当时在南法与美国在欧洲的阴谋家墨菲密谈的邱吉尔。真理报记者朱可夫二十日自巴黎报导说：“时机在改变着，在大洋彼岸的反动派看来，昨天还似乎可以借‘第三种力量’的橡皮棍来保持法国服服贴贴，谁知道现在为了这同一目的，不会需要拿出独裁的赤裸裸的钢刀呢？因为工人正以日益强大的抵抗反对美法托辣斯对其权利的侵犯。”
    在整个阁潮期间，法国共产党曾几次发出号召，指出法国人民必须有一个保卫独立、保卫劳动人民利益的民主联合政府。这些号召获得人民中广大阶层特别是工人群众的支持。苏联劳动报外交评论员说：“传统的议会集团不可能有脱出法国经济与政治危机的道路，只有获得人民信任因而强大的真正的民主政府，才能领导法国走出绝境。”真理报评论指出：法国的“国内形势将大为紧张；热爱法国光荣、自由与独立的民主势力与遵从外国命令而损害法国人民利益的反动势力之间，将有更尖锐的斗争”。
