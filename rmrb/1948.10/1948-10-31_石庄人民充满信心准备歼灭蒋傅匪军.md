　　[This Newspaper] Shijiazhuang newspapers and radio stations revealed on the 27th that the enemy was preparing to sneak attack Shijiazhuang. The Municipal Government and Garrison Headquarters immediately issued a joint proclamation calling on citizens to "urgently mobilize and smash the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit troops' offense." At 7 p.m., mass meetings for war preparedness were held in all districts and streets. Enemy planes raided during these meetings, and citizens evacuated in an organized manner for air defense. After the air raid alert was lifted, the war preparedness meetings continued. Citizen Chen Youshan said: "The Kuomintang doesn't have such a big stomach. If they come in the front, the rear will be empty. We'll eat them in the front, and then take their Baoding in the rear." Another person said: "This is like a chick flapping its wings before it dies." Ma Zhanbin, a member of the Railway Workers' Union and a veteran worker of the "February 7th" strike, stroked his gray beard and said: "They're like a drill that doesn't care about its rear, they're bound to be unlucky." Starting on the 27th, women, children, the elderly, and the weak began to evacuate in an organized manner, with order and efficiency. At 11 a.m. on the 27th, the price of rice rose by 60%. State-owned stores immediately released large quantities of goods, and after 11 a.m., prices stabilized. Neighborhood defense teams patrolled day and night from the evening of the 27th. In one district, a street's residents spontaneously organized more than 20 security groups to assist the government in eliminating spies and preventing sabotage. Many factories established armed self-defense teams and protective teams that did not leave production, responsible for maintaining order, while factories continued to operate as usual. Before the war preparedness, one factory produced 920 kilograms of a certain product daily. On the 27th, amid the war preparedness, it produced 1,128 kilograms. The workers were determined to send the extra product to the front lines to assist the troops in eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops who dared to invade. On the morning of the 28th, the reporter attended a command headquarters meeting. A certain general calmly and seriously deployed military and various other tasks, saying: "Since they're delivering themselves to our doorstep, we'll eat them up cleanly." At this moment, the telephone brought news of the great victory in western Liaoning and our army's capture of the key point of Niutuozhai on the periphery of Taiyuan. Those present excitedly discussed ways to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the enemy." A certain person in charge earnestly cautioned everyone: "We must be responsible to the citizens. State-owned stores will guarantee sufficient supply of essential goods to the citizens and stabilize prices." At this meeting, some signs of unease were criticized. Indeed, the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army are responsible to the people. The newspapers and radio stations announce news of enemy movements at any time, and the citizens are very satisfied with this alone. Many citizens said: "When the People's Liberation Army attacked Shijiazhuang, they had already entered the northern outskirts of the city, but the Kuomintang still said nothing was happening. They bragged that reinforcements had arrived at Dongchangshou. Before long, even Liu Ying (the highest commander of the Kuomintang guarding Shijiazhuang at the time) was captured. The democratic government is good. They tell us all the news so we can prepare early." On the 28th, the reporter patrolled the streets, and shops were open as usual. Some construction projects on Youth Road were continuing. Pedestrians were calm and hurried, and citizen self-defense teams patrolled various places. Shijiazhuang has mobilized, preparing to annihilate the invading Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops.

　　石庄人民充满信心准备歼灭蒋傅匪军
    【本报讯】石家庄报纸和电台在二十七日揭露了敌人准备偷袭石家庄的企图后，市政府、警备部立即颁发联合布告，号召市民“紧急动员起来，粉碎蒋傅匪军的冒犯。”晚七时，各区各街召开群众性的备战会议，适遇敌机空袭，市民有组织的疏散防空。警报解除，备战会议继续举行。市民陈友山说：“国民党没有那么大肚子，前面来了，后面空了。前面把它吃掉，后面拿它的保定。”另有人说：“这是小鸡临死以前打扑楞。”铁路工会委员、“二七”老工人马占斌摸着花白胡须说：“它是钻头不顾屁股，总要倒霉的。”从二十七日起，妇孺老弱开始有组织的进行疏散，秩序有条不紊。二十七日十一时，米价一度上涨百分之六十。公营商店立即抛售大批物资，十一时后即转趋平稳。各街区防护队从二十七日晚起，昼夜巡逻。一区有某街群众自发的组织了二十几个治安小组，协助政府除奸防谍。许多工厂成立了武装自卫队和不脱离生产的防护队，负责维持秩序，工厂则照常开工。某厂备战前每日生产某种产品九二○公斤，二十七日在备战声中，生产了一一二八公斤。工人们决心以超额的产品送给前线，协助部队消灭敢于进犯的蒋匪军。二十八日晨，记者参加指挥部会议，某将军从容而严肃的布置军事及各种工作，他说：“送上门来，干干脆脆的吃了它。”这时电话机送来辽西大捷及太原外围我克要点牛驼寨的消息，与会者兴奋的谈论着“彻底、干净、全部消灭敌人”的办法。某负责人谆谆告诫大家：“我们要为市民负责，公营商店保证供给市民足够的必需品，平稳物价。”在这个会上，有些不沉着的现象则受了批评。的确，民主政府和解放军是对人民负责的，报纸、播音机随时宣布敌人动向的消息，只这一点，市民就非常满意。许多市民说：“解放军打石家庄时，已经打进市区北卡子，国民党还说没有事。他们吹牛，说援军到了东长寿。没有多久，连刘英（当时国民党守石家庄的最高指挥官）都被捉住了。民主政府好，有什么消息都告诉咱们，早作准备。”二十八日，记者巡视街头，商店照常营业。青年路某些建筑工程在继续进行中。行人镇定匆忙，市民自卫队巡逻各地。石家庄动员起来了，准备着消灭进犯的蒋匪军。
