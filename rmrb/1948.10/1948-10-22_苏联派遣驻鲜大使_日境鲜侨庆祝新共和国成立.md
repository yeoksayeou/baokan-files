　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, Moscow, 15th: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has appointed Shtykov as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Soviet Union to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Shtykov was formerly the commander of the Soviet forces in North Korea.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Moscow dispatch: The newspaper "Izvestia" commented on the 14th on the exchange of letters between Stalin and Kim Il-sung regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stating that this is "an event of great international significance. Korea is the first colonial country liberated from imperialist oppression as a result of the defeat of fascist Germany and militarist Japan." Since the Soviet army defeated Japan and liberated Korea, the Soviet Union's policy has been to "provide all possible assistance to the reviving Korean people in establishing an independent and democratic state." "Izvestia" condemned "the U.S. government for disregarding the decisions of the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, taking the path of dividing Korea and turning its southern part into a U.S. military fortress. Driven by expansionists who dream of ruling the world, the U.S. government undermined the work of the Soviet-U.S. Joint Commission on Korea and, in violation of the UN Charter and the international obligations of the United States, submitted the Korean issue to the UN General Assembly in an attempt to use the prestige of international organizations to cover up the U.S.'s selfish policy of attempting to divide Korea and consolidate U.S. influence in Korea." "Izvestia" concluded: "The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the powerful Soviet power is a step in consolidating Korean national independence—a struggle for peace and security in the Far East."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Reports from various sources: Korean residents in Japan have been celebrating the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in recent days, despite the suppression by the U.S.-Japan police. On the 11th, Korean residents in Sendai City (northeastern Honshu) held a celebration. U.S.-Japan police officers were present to monitor and forced the lowering of the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The next day, Korean residents raised the flag they loved again, and U.S. military police confiscated the flag, causing a conflict. The arrogant U.S. military police opened fire on the spot, injuring dozens of Korean residents, one of whom died from a bullet wound to the abdomen. Five people were arrested. On the 14th, Korean residents in Tokyo held a similar celebration, and Japanese police also wielded batons, forcing attendees to lower the flag from the roof. However, on the morning of the 17th, another 3,000 Korean residents in Tokyo gathered to celebrate.

　　苏联派遣驻鲜大使
  　日境鲜侨庆祝新共和国成立
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团任命西地科夫为苏联驻朝鲜人民民主共和国特命全权大使。按西地科夫前任驻北朝鲜苏军司令。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：消息报于十四日评论斯大林和金日成关于建立苏联与朝鲜人民民主共和国之间外交关系的交换函件称：这是“具有重大国际意义的事件。朝鲜是作为击溃了法西斯德国和军国主义日本的结果而从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的第一个殖民地国家”。自从苏军击败日本，使朝鲜获得解放以来，苏联的政策，是“对复兴中的朝鲜人民提供了建立独立民主国家的一切可能的援助”。消息报斥责“美国政府不顾苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议的决定，采取了分裂朝鲜，并使其南部成为美国军事堡垒的道路。美国政府受着梦想统治世界的扩张主义分子的鞭策，破坏了朝鲜苏、美联合委员会的工作，并违反联合国宪章及美国的国际义务，把朝鲜问题提交联合国大会，以图利用国际组织的威信来掩饰美国企图分裂朝鲜并巩固美国在朝鲜的势力之自私政策。”消息报最后指出：“朝鲜人民民主共和国和强大的苏维埃强国之间建立外交关系，是巩固朝鲜民族独立——争取远东和平与安全的斗争中的新因素——的一个步骤。”
    【新华社陕北十九日电】各方报导：日境朝鲜侨民连日不顾美日宪警的镇压，庆祝朝鲜人民民主共和国的成立。十一日，仙台城（本州东北部）的朝鲜侨民举行庆祝会，美日宪警莅场监视，并迫令降下朝鲜人民民主共和国国旗。第二日，朝鲜侨民再度升起自己爱戴的国旗，美国宪兵竟将国旗没收，因而引起冲突。蛮横的美国宪兵当场开枪，朝鲜侨民数十人受伤，中一人因子弹穿腹毙命。并有五人被捕。十四日，东京的朝鲜侨民举行同样的庆祝会，日本警察也挥着棒棍，强迫与会者从屋顶降下国旗。但十七日晨东京朝鲜侨民又有三千人集会庆祝。
