　　French Labor Strikes Break Out One After Another
  　National Dockworkers and Lyon Railway Workers Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th] Reports from various sources: As of the 13th, the strike movement in France was still continuing one after another. Dockworkers across France responded to the call of the National Committee of the Port and Dock Workers' Union and held a 24-hour warning strike on the 13th. After the resumption of work on the state-owned railways in eastern France, railway workers in Lyon have launched a new strike. In addition, at least seven railway centers are voting on strikes. In Reims, even railway workers from the Catholic union passed a resolution to join the strike. "Government sources in France admit that industrial paralysis is spreading due to the ten-day-long coal mine strike, scattered railway strikes, and strikes in the textile and steel industries" (United Press). The South Wales Miners' Federation and the Scottish Miners' Delegation have both passed resolutions in support of the striking French coal miners. The South Wales Miners' Federation also protested against the British government for exporting coal to France during the French miners' strike.

　　法国工潮彼伏此起
  　全国码头工人及里昂铁路工人罢工
    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方报导：法国罢工运动至十三日止仍在彼伏此起继续中。全法码头工人响应海港码头工人工会全国委员会的号召，于十三日举行了二十四小时的警告性罢工。在法国东部国营铁路复工以后，里昂铁路工人又已掀起新的罢工。此外正在表决罢工的至少有七个铁路中心。在里姆斯，甚至天主教工会的铁路工人也通过决议参加罢工。法“政府方面消息承认由于持续十日的煤矿罢工，散布各处的铁路罢工，及纺织业与钢铁工业的罢工，工业的瘫痪正在蔓延”（合众社）。英国南威尔士矿工联合会与苏格兰矿工代表会均通过决议，声援正在罢工中的法国煤矿矿工。南威尔士矿工联合会并抗议英国政府在法国矿工罢工期间对法输出煤斤。
