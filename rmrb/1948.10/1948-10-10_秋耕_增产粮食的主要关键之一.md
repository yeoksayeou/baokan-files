Autumn Cultivation
    ——One of the Main Keys to Increased Grain Production

    　　　　Autumn Cultivation and Pest Control

    This year, various parts of North China have suffered from insect plagues. Affected areas cover about 150 counties in Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, Taihang, Northern Yue, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan. More than half of these counties are severely affected. In the second and fourth districts of Southern Hebei, armyworms and locust nymphs have devoured millions of mu of crops, resulting in an estimated reduction of 16 million jin of grain. In the eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts of Central Hebei, more than 3,900 villages have suffered from insect damage, resulting in a 30 to 50 percent reduction in autumn harvests. In Taihang, more than 100,000 mu of autumn seedlings in 17 counties, including Lin County and Tangyin, have been destroyed by locusts. It is estimated that the loss from insect pests in the entire region is at least 200,000 shi. Although the period of pest infestation has passed this year, if no fundamental prevention and control measures are taken now, the insect plague next year may be even more severe than this year. This is because their adults, larvae, or pupae and eggs mostly hibernate underground, in grass, in crop stubble, and on tree trunks, waiting to reproduce more offspring after the winter. In controlling pests, if prevention is not done in advance, it will be more difficult and less effective when they are already discovered or spreading. This year, the efforts made in various places to eliminate insect pests have not been small, but they still suffered such a large loss, which is a clear proof. Only by preventing problems before they occur and eliminating pests when they stop moving is the most effective way to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Specific control methods include: cleaning the fields, burning weeds on slopes and field edges to eliminate armyworms, rice caseworms, aphids (honeydew insects, oil dragons), flea beetles (cabbage worms, black beetles, mingkelang), etc., that are lurking in the stems and leaves of crops or weeds left in the fields; digging up rice and grain stubble to eliminate rice stem borers and rice borers; digging up locust eggs in areas where locust nymphs occur; and using many other methods such as attracting and killing pests according to their habits, which can be implemented according to the specific conditions of each place. At present, the most effective way to prevent and control pests, and which also has many other benefits, is to seize the time to carry out autumn cultivation.

    Because of the anti-mopping-up campaign in the thirty-second year of the Republic of China (1943) we were unable to take care of autumn cultivation, and in the thirty-fourth year (1945) locust plagues occurred everywhere. In recent years, due to the war, the reduction of labor and animal power, and the deviations in the review and land reform, autumn cultivation has not been done well, resulting in continuous insect plagues, which have accumulated and led to this year's widespread insect plague. This shows that there is a regular cause-and-effect relationship between autumn cultivation and insect plagues; many people also understand this situation.

    Autumn cultivation can prevent and control insect pests because many pests that overwinter underground in different forms (such as locusts and grasshoppers in the form of eggs, rice bugs and wheat midges in the form of pupae, armyworms, wireworms, scarabs, and cutworms (ground tigers) in the form of larvae (ie, ji@) overwinter underground). When the soil is turned over during autumn cultivation, some are eaten by birds and animals, some are scorched by the sun, and some are frozen to death by the cold winter. The rest that are still pressed into the turned soil also mostly die because they cannot survive if they are too deep, or because the soil is loose and cannot keep them warm if they are too shallow. (If women and children can be organized to inspect and collect the adults, larvae, or pupae and eggs that are turned up and burn them, that would be even better). Rice stem borers lurking in rice stubble and rice borers in rice stubble can also be collected and burned as firewood in conjunction with autumn cultivation.

    　　　　Autumn Cultivation and Soil

    In addition to preventing and controlling insect pests, autumn cultivation has the following benefits:

    Improving the soil and increasing fertility: Land that has not been cultivated in the autumn is firm, and the fertility of each part (surface layer, bottom layer, furrows, ridges) is in an unbalanced state due to the absorption of crops and weeds. After autumn cultivation, the soil in each part is mixed and adjusted. Because the soil is loose, it is easy for air to circulate and absorb light and heat, providing favorable conditions for soil bacteria. Moreover, during the cold season, the soil freezes deeper and firmer, and when it thaws in the spring, it increases the weathering and decomposition of the soil. Therefore, autumn cultivation is also a good way to improve the soil and increase fertility.

    Autumn cultivation can plow up perennial weeds and turn weeds and crop stems and leaves left on the ground into the soil, turning them into fertilizer.

    After autumn cultivation, more autumn rain can be absorbed and winter snow can be preserved, and the upward evaporation of moisture in the lower layer can be reduced, maintaining the moisture needed for spring cultivation. It is easy to preserve seedlings, especially cotton, which must be deeply cultivated and meticulously cultivated to preserve seedlings well. Therefore, autumn cultivation also has the effect of preventing spring drought.

    Land that has been cultivated in the autumn is easier to plow in the coming year and will not face the danger of not being able to carry out spring cultivation and sowing due to a slight delay caused by spring drought or spring busy season. The saying among the masses, "In autumn, even if the crows break the skin, it's better than plowing once in the spring," illustrates that autumn cultivation has more advantages than spring cultivation. Moreover, autumn is the time when plowing animals are fat and strong, so they can plow deeply, well, and quickly, laying a favorable foundation for spring cultivation and sowing when the plowing animals are relatively weak in the spring.

    　　　　Deep Plowing, Meticulous Plowing, Early Plowing

    In carrying out autumn cultivation, the following points should also be noted:

    1. Deep plowing is necessary: Most people understand the benefits of deep plowing, but some people do not dare to plow deeply, fearing that turning up raw soil will not be conducive to crop growth. Although there is some truth to this, it is one-sided and not entirely correct. The raw soil turned up during deep plowing turns into mature soil after being exposed to wind and sun and freezing and thawing in the winter. This precisely illustrates the benefit of deep plowing in increasing mature soil and improving the soil, which is not harmful to crop growth but greatly beneficial. There are folk sayings such as "Plow deep in the autumn, plow shallow in the spring, and you don't have to worry about drought or flood," and "Deep plowing is like applying manure," which are in line with scientific principles. He Fulai, a labor hero from Yanchang, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, plows the land to a depth of seven inches, turning up raw soil every year, and averages two or three dou more per hectare than others. Zhang Jiage in Suide turns up raw soil to be exposed to the sun to make it improve into mature soil. According to their experience, it is best to apply more manure to raw soil in the first year, and no manure is needed in the second year, and any crops can be planted. Therefore, they say, "Raw soil is like a young doll, it can absorb rain and is very strong." At present, the depth of cultivated land in most areas is only two or three inches, which is not good for crop growth and soil improvement. Deep plowing should be promoted to gradually turn up some raw soil every year to increase mature soil. Increasing mature soil in this way: (1) can provide crops with more nutrients; (2) crops can grow more roots, root deeper, absorb more nutrients, and are less likely to be blown down by the wind; (3) the amount of rainwater that can be contained increases, allowing more rainwater to seep into the ground, reducing runoff and enhancing drought resistance; (4) the applied fertilizer can seep into the bottom layer, reducing runoff (deep plowing requires more fertilizer than shallow plowing, but this is not a loss of fertilizer but an increase in fertility). If shallow plowing is done, the effectiveness of autumn cultivation will be greatly reduced. In alkaline land, some people do not dare to plow deeply, fearing that the alkaline soil will be turned up. In fact, the opposite is true: the shallower the plowing, the more alkali remains in the surface layer; with deep plowing, the alkali seeps into the bottom layer, which can reduce the harm to crops. Naturally, deep plowing must also be done appropriately, gradually increasing the depth each year, and not suddenly increasing it excessively by two or three inches.

    2. Meticulous plowing is necessary: Meticulous plowing means plowing thoroughly and evenly, one plow next to another, without leaving unplowed hard ridges. There is a saying among the masses, "One foot wide is not as good as one inch thick," which means "meticulous plowing." The standard of meticulous plowing is appropriately described by the masses as "ten plows per step" or "seven plows per gai (approximately five feet or more)." In short, the furrows must be straight, the width must be uniform, and the distance must be moderate; otherwise, the actual effect of autumn cultivation will inevitably be reduced.

    3. Except for sandy soil, which must be covered and rolled after plowing to prevent the soil from being blown away by the wind, in general, it is not necessary to cover or roll the soil, because this makes it easier for pests to freeze to death, facilitates the decomposition and improvement of the soil, and the plowing furrows and coarse soil clumps can retain more snow, avoid the soil from being scraped away, and prevent hard soil from forming when it thaws in the spring and is plowed and harrowed.

    4. There is a folk saying, "Seven gold, eight silver, nine copper, ten iron" (the numbers are lunar months, meaning that the earlier the autumn cultivation, the better), which illustrates that the earlier the plowing period, the better, because the weeds have not yet withered and yellowed, are more fertile and easier to rot, and it extends the time for soil loosening, fallowing, and weathering. It is best to plow more times in the autumn, but at present, we should mainly strive for universal autumn cultivation, with at least one plowing.

    5. In areas without the habit of autumn cultivation, we must do our best to publicize the benefits of autumn cultivation, so that the masses value autumn cultivation and improve the backward farming habits of not cultivating in the autumn or even planting blank stubble fields; we must recognize that autumn cultivation is the foundation of next year's great production and one of the important keys to whether grain production can be increased.

　　秋耕
    ——增产粮食的主要关键之一
    　　　　秋耕与除虫
    今年华北各地普遭虫灾，受害地区遍及冀南、冀中、太行、北岳、冀鲁豫各地约百五十余县，其中半数以上县份较为严重，冀南二、四分区被黏虫、蝗蝻吃光庄稼百万亩，估计减收粮食一千六百万斤；冀中八、九、十一等分区有三千九百余村遭受虫害，被害秋田减收百分之三十至五十。太行林县、汤阴等十七县被蝗虫吃毁秋苗十余万亩。估计全区虫害损失最低亦在二十万市石以上。今年害虫为害期间虽已过去，但如果不从现在起讲求治本防除办法，明年虫灾可能较今年更为严重；因为它们的成虫、幼虫或虫蛹虫卵多蛰伏在地下、草丛、秸槎、树株上，等待寒冬过后再繁殖更多的后代。在除治虫害上，如不预为防治，到已经发现或蔓延，就费力大而收效小。今年各地为消灭虫灾而花费的力量不谓不大，但仍遭受了偌大的损失，便是一个明证。只有防患于未然，在害虫停止活动的时候予以除治，是最有效的事半功倍的办法。具体除治的办法有：清洁田园，烧除阶埝地畔的杂草，以除治潜伏在遗落田园之庄稼茎叶或杂草中的黏虫（＠＠虫）、稻苞虫、蚜虫（蜜虫、油龙）、猿叶虫（菜虫、黑盖虫、明克螂）等；掘除谷槎、稻槎以除治谷钻心虫、稻螟虫，在发生蝗蝻地区挖掘蝗卵，以及适应虫性予以诱杀等许多办法，都可根据各地具体情况实行。在目前防除害虫最有效验而又具有其他很多益处的办法，是抓紧进行秋耕。
    三十二年因反扫荡未能顾及秋耕，三十四年便普遍发生蝗灾，几年来由于战争关系，劳力、畜力减少，以及复查、土改中偏向的影响，秋耕未能做好，以致连年发生虫灾，积而酿成今年的普遍虫灾，这说明秋耕与虫灾是一个有规律的因果关系；许多群众也都了解这种情况。
    秋耕能防除害虫，是因为许多以不同形态在地下越冬的害虫（如蝗虫、土蚂蚱之以卵，步曲、麦蝇之以蛹、黏虫、金针虫、金龟子、切根虫（地老虎）之以幼虫（即跻＠）在地下越冬），秋耕时被翻上地面，有的为鸟兽吃掉，有的被阳光死晒，有的经严冬风寒而冻死，其余仍被压翻土中的也多因深则不宜生存，浅则地土疏松不能保温而死亡（如能组织妇女儿童随耕随检视，将翻上地面的成虫幼虫或虫蛹虫卵捡集起来烧死，则更好）。潜伏谷槎中的谷钻心虫，稻槎中的螟虫，也可结合秋耕同时捡拾起来当柴烧掉。
    　　　　秋耕与土壤
    秋耕除防治害虫之外，还有以下几种益处：
    改良土壤，增加地力：未经秋耕之地，地土坚实，各部（表层、底层、垄沟、垄台）的肥力因作物与杂草的吸收而是不均衡状态；秋耕后，各部土壤混和调整，又由于土壤疏松，便于流通空气吸收光热，使土壤细菌得到活跃条件，而且严寒时期冻结的较深较坚，春暖再经融解，增加土壤的风化分解，因此秋耕也是改良土壤增加地力的良法。
    秋耕可以犁除宿根杂草，并将杂草和遗落地面的作物茎叶翻入土内，变成肥料。
    秋耕后，能较多的吸收秋雨和保存冬雪，并使下层的水分减少上升蒸发，保持春耕所需水分。容易保苗，特别是棉花，必须深耕、精耕，才好保苗。因之秋耕又有防遏春旱效能。
    秋耕过的地，来年土松易犁，不致发生由于春旱或春忙略有耽搁即不能进行春耕播种的危险。群众所说：“秋天老鸦蹬破皮，赛如春天犁一犁。”就正是说明秋耕比春耕好处更多。并且秋季正值耕畜肥壮，能耕得深、耕得好、耕得快，给明春耕畜比较瘦弱时的春耕播种打下有利的基础。
    　　　　深耕　精耕　早耕
    在进行秋耕上，还有下面几点应该注意的事项：
    一、要深耕：群众大多了解深耕的益处，但也有一部分人不敢深耕，怕翻起生土不宜于作物生长。这虽有部分道理，但失于片面，并不完全正确。深耕时翻上的生土经过冬季风吹日晒和冻结与融解，次年春季已变成熟土，这正说明深耕能够增加熟土改良土壤的好处，对作物生长不但无害反而大大有益。群众中有所谓“秋耕深、春耕浅，旱涝不用管。”“深耕如上粪”的农谚，是合乎科学道理的。陕甘宁延长劳英贺福来，犁地深到七寸，年年翻起生地，平均每垧地比别人多收二、三斗；绥德张家圪翻起生地晒太阳，使之改良成熟土。据他们的经验：生土第一年宜多上粪，第二年则可不上粪，种什么庄稼都行。所以他们说：“生土好比年青娃，又能吸雨又劲大。”目前各地耕地深度，大多才只二、三寸，对作物的生长和土壤改良都是不好的；应该提倡深耕，每年逐渐翻起些生地，以增加熟土。这样增多熟土：（一）可供给作物以更多养分；（二）作物可多生根，往深处扎根，吸收更多养分，且不易被风吹倒；（三）对雨水含蓄量增大，使雨水更多的渗入地下，减少流失，增强抗旱力；（四）施用的肥料可以渗入底层，减少流失（深耕须比浅耕时多施些肥料，但这不是肥料的损失而是增加了地力）。倘若浅耕，便大为减少秋耕的效用。碱性地，有的人也不敢深耕，怕碱土翻上来。其实恰恰相反：越是浅耕，碱性越多停留在表层；深耕了，则碱性渗向底层，可减少对作物的危害。自然，深耕也须有适当分寸，要逐年渐次加深，不能突然过度加深到二三寸。
    二、要精耕：精耕就是要耕得周到匀实，一犁挨一犁，不能留下没耕翻的硬土梁，农谚有所谓“宽一尺不如厚一寸”，就是说的要“精耕”。精耕的标准群众中有所谓“一步十犁”或“一盖（约五尺余）七犁”，是很适当的。总之，沟要直，宽窄要均匀，距离要适中，否则就必然减低秋耕实效。
    三、除沙土耕后须加以盖、磨，以免被风吹失土壤外，一般可不盖、不磨，因为这样能使害虫易于冻死，又宜于土壤的分解改良，并且有耕犁的条沟与粗疏的土块，可保留较多的雪，避免刮失土壤，而来春一经解冻即行犁耙，也不致有硬土＠拉。
    四、农谚有所谓“七金八银九铜十铁”，（数字是阴历月份，意思是说秋耕越早好处越多），即说明耕期以愈早愈好，因提早秋耕杂草尚未萎黄，多肥易腐，且延长土壤松解休闲和风化的时间。秋耕次数，以多耕为上，但目前主要应争取普遍秋耕，最少耕犁一遍。
    五、对无秋耕习惯的地区，要尽力宣传秋耕益处，使群众重视秋耕，改进不秋耕甚至种白茬地的落后耕作习惯；要认识秋耕是明年大生产的基础，是能否增产粮食的重要关键之一。
