Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 11th: The Indonesian People's Army, led by the Indonesian Communist Party, has adopted a form primarily based on guerrilla warfare and is widely developing in central and eastern Java. According to a TASS dispatch from The Hague on the 7th, citing news from Indonesia, the revolutionary government is expanding its influence in central and eastern Java. This news proves that the repeated statements by Indonesian Nationalist Party leaders Sukarno, Hatta, and others that they have almost completely eliminated the "Communist army" are entirely absurd. The Dutch news agency acknowledged that the workers' brigade in the Cipu oil center area north of Madiun is victoriously resisting the Hatta government's army, and stated that recently more Hatta soldiers have surrendered to the Communists; most of the Ulung Pag province and Qidu province in East Java are still in the hands of the Communists and their supporters; in Blitar on the south coast of East Java, the Socialist Youth Detachment is resisting the Hatta army; the Hatta army's Jeni Da troops refused to obey the reactionary government's orders. According to news from American and French news agencies, the People's Army withdrew from Madiun on September 30th, carrying military equipment and food, and developed in both the north and south directions. The southern route reached the Willis Mountains, occupied Dengas and Kandang, southeast of Madiun, and still holds Unokili between Madiun and Yogyakarta, and Paqitan, a strategic point on the southwest coast of Madiun. Paudati, north of Solo, is still in the hands of the People's Army. Due to the development of guerrilla warfare and the people's movement, the panicked Hatta government is continuing its frenzied suppression, arresting 4,000 people in Yogyakarta alone.

　　印尼人民军发展游击战
    在爪哇中部东部扩大势力
    【新华社陕北十一日电】印尼共产党领导的印尼人民军已采取以游击战争为主的形式，在爪哇中部与东部广泛发展。据塔斯社海牙七日电引得自印尼消息称：革命政府正在爪哇中部与东部扩大势力，这则消息，证明了印尼国民党头子苏加诺、哈达等人一再声明所谓已几乎全部消灭“共产党军队”，全是无稽之谈。荷兰通讯社承认茉莉芬以北芝普石油中心区工人大队正在胜利地抗击哈达政府的军队，并称：最近更多的哈达军队投降共产党；东爪哇乌冷巴格全省、齐都省的大部仍在共产党及其拥护者手里；在东爪哇南岸的勿里塔，社会主义青年支队正在抗击哈达军；哈达军的杰尼达部队拒绝服从反动政府的命令。据美、法通讯社消息：人民军已于九月三十日撤离茉莉芬城，携带军备与粮食向南北两面发展。南路抵达威里斯山地，占领茉莉芬东南的登加斯和坎当，并仍握有茉莉芬与日惹之间的乌诺基利、茉莉芬西南海岸要地派齐丹。梭罗以北的帕乌达底仍在人民军手中。由于游击战争与人民运动的发展，恐慌的哈达政府正继续其疯狂的镇压，仅在日惹一地即逮捕了四千人。
