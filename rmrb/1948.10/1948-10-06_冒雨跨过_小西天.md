　　Crossing "Little Western Paradise" in the Rain
  　Frontline Dispatch
    A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army received a mission from higher authorities to advance westward from the Pinggu Line. The unit set out at four in the morning, and had to pass through "Little Western Paradise," the highest point in this mountainous area, ascending and descending for about forty or fifty *li*. The mountain road was rugged and difficult to traverse. As soon as the队伍 (duìwǔ - ranks, contingent, armed forces, team, etc.) gathered, the rain began to fall. At first, everyone was as usual, and when someone slipped or fell into the river, there was the usual burst of mixed laughter. The comrades of the Second Battalion told stories of the Long March to relieve boredom. Some said that we were like climbing snow-capped mountains, talking as we walked. Before we knew it, everyone had reached the first line of mountain peaks along the Great Wall. The mountain became higher and higher, the rain became heavier and heavier, and the difficulties gradually approached. The clothing on their bodies alone doubled in weight. It was past noon and they had only climbed halfway. Looking back, the mountains they had just climbed over had all turned into hills. When they reached the top of the mountain, there was another downpour. People's clothes were all soaked through. Although it was early autumn, the mountain was bitterly cold, like midwinter. In addition, the mountain water was over their stomachs, and the road was muddy. Everyone was shivering with cold. There were no villages along the way, and occasionally there was a thatched cottage on the mountainside, but that could not accommodate such a large contingent. It was impossible to warm up and increase warmth. Some of the comrades with weaker bodies could not hold on. But these difficulties did not frighten the warriors, nor did they stop the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army. Under the call and leadership of the cadres, everyone fought the difficulties ahead with strong will and great love.
    First of all, the cadres took the lead and stepped forward. Liu Peiying, the deputy company commander of the Second Company, carried the cook Zhang Zhi, who had been frostbitten, from the mountain to Lianhua Ban, a distance of three or four *li*. Bai Zhizhong, the political instructor of the Sixth Company, also carried four comrades who were about to faint down the mountain, one trip after another. Tian Wanyun, the guard platoon leader of the Second Battalion, carried a soldier down the slippery road, saving him. The cadres' shoulders were even more full. Ruan Erlai, the deputy political instructor of the Seventh Company, carried an oil bucket for the cook for more than twenty *li*. The machine gun company commander of the First Battalion saw that a soldier was about to freeze to death, and quickly took off his raincoat and gave it to him. He didn't have a raincoat and was so cold that he fainted, and then others helped him walk. Platoon leader Xue Chengfei carried three large guns for the soldiers. Other comrades such as platoon leaders Ma Zhanyuan, Hao Ming, and Li Liansheng also moved the soldiers. In addition, many comrades had no strength in their legs from being soaked in the rain. Some were washed down when crossing the river. At this time, Qi Zhizhong, the third battalion commander, Li Zhimin, the political instructor of the eighth company, the machine gun company commander, and other comrades gritted their teeth and endured the cold, vigorously boosting their spirits, pulling and pulling to help the comrades across. Deputy Battalion Commander Yang Xuehui and Platoon Leader Qi Chang held the mine sweeping pole for everyone to hold on to while crossing the river, ensuring the safety of crossing the river.
    The exemplary role of the cadres motivated a large number of activists (mostly Party members). They all shook off their spirits and tried their best to help others. If you fall, I will help you up. If I freeze and faint, you will save me again. Li Tianxi and Liu Zhi of the First Company froze and fell to the ground. Zhang Guodong and others forcibly carried them to the camp. Zhang Zhilan and Liu Fule of the 60-mortar squad of the Second Battalion took over the two ammunition boxes of the machine gun squad and carried them for more than twenty *li*. Zhang Yuanzhang carried a comrade who had frozen unconscious for more than five *li*, and only woke him up after reaching a small house. The deputy squad leader of the second squad of the Fifth Company carried a box of explosives and a large gun for others, carrying them for thirty or forty *li*. He was so tired that he fell down and got up, and got up and fell down again when crossing the river, but he never uttered a word of bitterness.
    The march across "Little Western Paradise" will make you feel the greatness of the people's soldiers and the organization and discipline of the soldiers. Shi Dajiang, a soldier of the Seventh Company, marched with illness. He fainted when going down the mountain. He was rescued by the rescue team and still wanted to catch up with the troops. Wei Caili, the deputy squad leader of the Ninth Company, carried a gun and a bedding roll for a comrade who had lost contact, and froze all night without a house. In the morning, he crossed the river alone to find the troops. He was washed down by the water countless times. He drank the water but did not let go of his rifle. He suffered several wounds, but he still desperately moved forward. Wei Xiaowa, a soldier of the small artillery squad of the Sixth Company, froze to death on the road, and the rescue team gave him two injections before he came back to life.
    Comrade Wei did not diminish his revolutionary sense of responsibility because of this. When he was on a stretcher, he seemed to have remembered something important. He struggled hard and looked at the comrades and said, "Don't lose my nine shells!"

### 冒雨跨过“小西天”

　　冒雨跨过“小西天”
  　前线通讯
    解放军某部接受上级任务，从平古线向西进军。部队早四点出发，要通过这一带山区的最高点上下够四五十里地的“小西天”，山路崎岖难走。队伍刚一集合，雨就下起来了。开始大家还和平时一样，有人滑倒了或掉到河里，照例掀起一阵杂乱的欢笑声。二营的同志们有很多讲长征故事解闷，有的说咱们如同爬雪山，边走边讲，不觉大家走上了沿长城的第一线山峰，山越上越高，雨也越下越大，困难也步步向人们逼近，只身上的着装就加重了一倍，天已过午才爬了一半，回头一望刚爬过的一层山峰都变成了丘陵。登上了山顶又来了一阵倾盆大雨，人们的衣服全淋透了，虽然是初秋天气，但山上却冷风刺骨，有如寒冬，再加上山水过腹，道路泥泞，大家都冻得混身发抖。半路又无村庄，偶而山腰中有一所茅舍，那能容下这样大的队伍？想烤一烤增加点暖气都不可能，身体弱的同志有些是支持不住了。但这些困难并没有把勇士们吓倒，也没有阻拦住解放军胜利的进军。在干部的号召及带领下，大家用坚强的意志和伟大的友爱，向面前的困难搏斗了。
    首先是干部们以身作则挺身而出。二连副连长刘佩英同志背着冻坏的炊事员张志，从山上背到莲花瓣够三四里路。六连政指白志忠也从山顶把将晕倒的四个同志一趟一趟的背下来，二营警卫排长田万云从一步一滑的道上背下一个战士将他救醒来。干部的肩上更是满满的，七连副政指阮二来替伙夫挑着油桶走了二十多里，一营机炮连长见一战士快冻倒，忙把自己的雨衣脱下给他穿上，自己没有雨衣被冻的晕倒又让别人挽着自己走，排长薛成飞给战士背着三枝大枪，其他如排长马占元、郝明、李连生等同志都使战士受到了感动。另外有不少的同志被雨淋的两腿没劲，过河时有被冲倒的，这时三营长齐之中、八连政指李志民、机炮连长等同志都是咬着牙耐着冷强振精神，拉一个扯一个的帮助同志们过去。副营长杨学辉同志、排长齐昌给大家掌住扫雷杆子让大家扶着过河，保证了过河的安全。
    干部的模范作用带动了大批的积极分子（大部是党员），他们都抖了抖精神，尽力帮助别人，你倒了我扶你，我冻晕了你又救我，一连李田喜、刘志冻倒在地上，张国栋等硬架到宿营地，二营六○炮班的张志兰、刘福乐接过了机枪班的两箱子弹，背了二十多里地，张元章将一冻昏的同志背了五里多地，到了一所小房中才救醒过来，五连二班副替别人背一箱炸药、一枝大枪，一直背了三几十里地，累的过河时倒下去爬起来，爬起来又倒下去，但始终没讲一个苦字。
    过“小西天”的行军，会使你感到人民战士的伟大、战士们的组织性纪律性，七连战士史大江带病行军，下山时晕过去，被收容组救活还一心追赶部队。九连副班长魏才立给一失掉联络的同志背着枪和被包掉在后边，一晚上没有房子冻了一夜，天明独自过河找寻部队，被水冲倒无数次，喝了水也不撒手自己的步枪，身受数处创伤，但他仍狠命的前进。六连小炮班战士魏小娃冻死在路上，救护组打了两针才活过来。
    魏同志并没因此稍减他革命的责任心，他上了担架临走时，好象想起了一件大事，吃力的挣扎了一下，看着同志们说：“我的九发炮弹可别丢了啊！”
