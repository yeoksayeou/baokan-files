　　To the Editors: Our People's Daily is a major newspaper in North China. I've noticed that in the past, there has been little coverage of cultural and educational work and the educational situation in various liberated areas (except for some reports on the Northeast), as well as the organizational activities of students. In fact, cultural and educational work is an important part of our new society, and we still don't know much about our experiences in this area and truly systematic, specific systems that conform to the New Democracy education policy (such as school systems, teaching methods, and organizing students), especially in newly liberated areas and cities. We will liberate more and larger cities day by day, and running schools and engaging in educational work is even more urgent. I hope our newspaper will introduce more of these materials and experiences to more quickly restore and develop our education work.

　　Reply: Your opinion is very good. Due to the victorious development of the revolutionary situation and the requirements of regular construction in North China, developing education and cultivating talent have become major political tasks of the moment. The Xinhua News Agency editorial (October 10th edition of this newspaper) has pointed out that the school education work in the liberated areas, with North China and the Northeast in the best condition, should bear a great responsibility in providing other liberated areas with their experience in educational work. But as the letter says, the past coverage in this area has been very insufficient. We hope that comrades engaged in educational work in various places can reflect the situation and experience of educational work in many ways, especially the situation and problems in the implementation of the resolutions of the secondary education conference, in order to exchange experiences and improve work.

　　To the Editors: We don't understand much about the development of various levels of schools and industries and commerce in Shijiazhuang City. We hope you can introduce them. (Zhu Yicheng)
　　Reply: Your opinion is very correct. The Shijiazhuang Daily and the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Xinhua News Agency have already paid attention to strengthening reporting. This newspaper will also do its best to organize interviews and report on the construction of industry, commerce, and education in Shijiazhuang to meet the expectations of readers.

### 文化教育工作的经验要有系统地更多介绍

　　文化教育工作的经验要有系统地更多介绍
    编辑同志：咱们的人民日报是华北的大报，我见到过去对文化教育工作及各解放区（除东北还刊登一些外）学校教育进行情况，同学们的组织活动情形很少介绍刊登，实际上文化教育工作在咱们新社会中也是重要的一部分，而我们在这方面的经验及成系统的真正合乎新民主主义教育政策的具体制度（如学制教学法组织发动同学）还知道的不多，尤其在新解放的地区城市。我们一天天将要解放更多更大的城市，办学校搞教育工作更为亟需，希望咱们报纸上也多介绍一些这种材料、经验，把我们的教育工作更迅速地恢复发展。

    答：你的意见很好，由于革命形势的胜利发展和华北正规建设的要求，发展教育，培植人材，已成了当前的重大政治任务。新华社社论（十月十日本报）已指出，目前各解放区的学校教育工作，以华北和东北的条件为最好，应该负起很大责任，供给其他各解放区以自己在教育工作上的经验。但确如来信所说，过去在这方面的报导是很不够的。希望各地从事教育工作的同志，能多方反映教育工作的情况经验，特别执行中等教育会议决议的情况及问题，以便交流经验改进工作。

    编辑同志：石家庄市内的各级学校及工商业的发展等等各种建设情形我们很不了解，希介绍为盼。　　（朱以诚）
    答：你的意见很对，现石家庄日报及新华社石家庄分社已注意加强报导，本报也当尽力组织采访石市工商业及教育工作的建设情况，以符读者的期望。
