(Jinzhong Electric Dispatch) With the active help and leadership of the democratic government, all fifteen schools in the Fenyang urban area have been restored in the past two months, with a total of 2,424 students. This includes two middle schools, five complete primary schools, eight junior primary schools, and other schools. In addition to public schools, there are also Mingyi Middle School, Baode Complete Primary School, Women's School, and Advanced Nursing School run by the North China Christian Anli Council; the Women's and Children's Literacy Class run by the Adventist Church, and the Catholic Church's Children's Work-Study Center and other private schools. With the protection and assistance of the democratic government, student enrollment has also increased. For example, Mingyi Middle School has 66 more students than during the Yan Xishan bandit regime. When the Yan bandits fled in panic on July 12, they coerced 45 teachers and some students, but all were rescued by the People's Liberation Army and safely returned to their hometowns. After the democratic government entered the city, it resolutely protected the schools, and all the schools' books, instruments, and equipment were intact. Teachers and students who had been under the long-term rule of Japanese invaders and Yan bandits, due to enemy and puppet enslavement education and slanderous propaganda, did not understand our policies and had some doubts. Our democratic municipal government specially held three symposiums for teachers and students in succession to announce and explain our party's various policies, especially the policies of protecting schools and intellectuals. We organized discussions and studies on the current situation and answered questions submitted anonymously. Among the more than 70 slips, more than 20 asked whether the Yan bandits' slanderous propaganda against our army, such as "24 tortures, 36 killings, poisoning, and starting sweet but turning bitter" were true. In addition to providing explanations one by one, it was emphasized that in the future, "everyone should look at the facts." Through these symposiums, especially after witnessing the implementation of various policies of the People's Liberation Army, the doubts gradually disappeared. The schools began to enroll students and prepare for the start of school. Initially, the students had a strong "change of dynasty" mentality, and few attended school; later, after students mobilized students, parents mobilized their children, and various meetings explained the situation, and because of the students' personal experience in the past two months, the number gradually increased by more than 700. With regard to the old faculty and staff, the principle of uniting, transforming, cultivating, and using was adopted. As long as they were not resolutely anti-communist and anti-people, were upright, supported democracy, were willing to engage in education, serve the people, and had certain working abilities, they could all be retained. Among the 112 teachers in the city, those who were retained accounted for more than 93%. The old teachers who had been under the long-term rule of the enemy and puppets eagerly requested to study and make progress. The municipal government immediately used after-school spare time to hold study seminars, where teachers themselves formed study groups, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," referring to other documents. They raised questions during reading, and then discussed and answered them collectively. They fully promoted democratic debate to seek the truth. Ten days later, at their request, they proposed studying the summary of the two years of the War of Liberation, two documents of the CCP Central Committee in 1933, several issues in the land reform, "On New Democracy," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," and speeches at the Forum on Literature and Art. They read at ordinary times, raised questions on Fridays, and discussed and answered them collectively on Sundays. It is also planned to establish academic research associations by teachers of various subjects to carry out study. In order to solve the family difficulties of teachers and staff, the democratic government first gave advance payments of allowances and grain, canceled unnecessary expenses, and increased necessary settings. After Fenyang Middle School approved 470 jin of wheat, it bought back a large number of books. In terms of teaching content, new textbooks are used as much as possible. Xinhua Bookstore and Yimin Bookstore have bought back a large number of readers from Jin-Sui and North China. Yilin Bookstore also printed more than 500 copies of Chinese textbooks on behalf of others. For those who lacked textbooks, history was temporarily replaced by "A Short History of China" and "A History of the Chinese Revolutionary Movement." There were no textbooks for natural science and mathematics, so the old ones were used temporarily. The reactionary subjects such as "Soldiers and Farmers as One" were immediately cancelled and replaced with political classes, explaining policies and current events.

(Further Dispatch) Fenyang City vigorously carries out social education work. At present, the city has seven blackboard newspapers run by various schools, which have promoted the city's work. They praised a certain district for organizing bicycle cooperative dividends to undertake transportation in support of the front, saving animal power for wheat planting, and praised blacksmiths who actively supported the front with ironware, inspiring the citizens' enthusiasm for supporting the front. The broad masses of citizens are vying to read books and magazines from the liberated areas and are more passionate about Chairman Mao's works. Whenever books such as "Mao Zedong's Biography," "Impressions of Mao Zedong," "Mao Zedong's Stories," and "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" arrive, they are snapped up and in short supply. In order to meet the needs of the citizens, the municipal government is now planning to set up a People's Education Center. Pornographic novels and magazines that used to be full of schools have almost disappeared. The song "Let's Go, Follow Mao Zedong!" resounds through every corner. Ximen Street Complete Primary School even wrote and performed two plays, "Liberation" and "Reunion," before the Mid-Autumn Festival, which were well received.

　　汾阳学校全部恢复
    学生增加，教职员普遍留任
    【晋中电】在民主政府积极帮助领导下，两月来，汾阳市区十五座学校全部恢复，学生共达二四二四人。包括两座中学校，五座完小和八座初小及其他学校。其中除公立学校外，还有华北基督教安理会所办的铭义中学，宝德完小，妇人学校及高级护士学校；安息会所办妇女儿童识字班，天主堂儿童工读所等私立学校。在民主政府保护与帮助下，学生亦有增加。如铭义中学较之阎匪统治期中增加六十六个学生。七月十二日阎匪仓慌溃逃时，箍走四十五名教员和一部分学生，但中途均为解放军拯救而安全返回家乡。民主政府入城后，坚决保护学校，各校图书仪器用具等均完整无损。在日寇阎匪长期统治下的教职员学生，因受敌伪奴化教育及诬蔑宣传，不了解我方政策，存在某些怀疑，我民主市政府特连续召开三次教职员学生座谈会，宣布和讲解我党各项政策，特别是保护学校和知识分子政策。组织目前形势的讨论、研究，并以不记名递条子提出问题，进行解答。在七十多个条子中，有二十多条询问阎匪对我军的诬蔑宣传“二十四刑、三十六杀、放毒、先甘后辣”等是否真有其事。除给予逐条解释外，强调指出今后“大家看事实”。经此座谈，特别是他们目睹解放军各种政策的实施，疑团逐渐消失。各校纷纷招生，筹备开学。起初学生中“变天”思想极浓，上学者少；后来经过学生动员学生，家长动员子弟，及各种会议讲解，更由于学生两月中的亲身体会，由原数逐渐增加七百余人。对旧有教职员，采取团结改造培养使用原则，只要不是坚决反共反人民、为人正派、赞成民主、愿意从事教育、为人民服务、并具有一定工作能力者，都可留用。全市一一二名教员中，留用者占百分之九十三强。长期在敌伪统治下的旧教员，都急切要求学习与进步。市政府即利用课外空余时召开学习座谈会，由教员自己组成学习小组，以毛主席目前形势与任务的学习为主，参考其他文件。阅读中提出问题，再集中讨论与解答。充分发扬民主辩论，求得真理。十天后，又在他们要求下，提出学习解放战争二年总结，中共中央一九三三年的两个文件，土改中的几个问题，新民主主义论，中国革命与中国共产党，和文艺座谈会讲话。平时阅读，礼拜五提出问题，礼拜日集中讨论与解答。另计划以各门教员分别成立学术研究会，进行学习。民主政府为解决教职员家庭困难，更先给预支津贴粮，取消不必要开支，增以必需的设置。汾阳中学批得四百七十斤麦子后，已买回大批图书。在教课内容上，尽量采取新课本。新华书店益民书店曾向晋绥华北各地买回大批读本。艺林书局亦代印国文课本五百余册。缺少课本的，历史则暂代以中国史话和中国革命运动史。自然数学没有课本，暂用旧的。“兵农合一”等反动科目则立即取消，改为政治课，讲解政策与时事。
    【又电】汾阳市大力开展社教工作，现全市共有各校所办之黑板报七块，结合推动了本市工作。他们表扬了某区组织脚踏车合作分红担任支前运输，节省畜力用于种麦的好办法，表扬了积极打铁器支前的铁匠，启发市民支前情绪。广大市民争读解放区书报杂志、对毛主席著作更加热爱。每当毛泽东生平、毛泽东印象记、毛泽东故事、及目前形势与任务等书一到，即抢购一空，供不应求。为满足市民此种要求，市政府现拟举办民教馆。过去充满各校之色情小说杂志，几已绝迹。“走，跟着毛泽东走！”的歌声响澈各个角落。西门街完小，更在中秋前自编自演“解放”和“团圆”两剧，获得好评。
