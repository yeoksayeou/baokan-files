Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 8th: A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, after its victory in annihilating Hu bandit’s 36th Division in the southern foothills of the Huanglong Mountains, created a new method of battle review: conducting practical exercises on the original battlefield. Immediately after the end of the campaign, the unit conducted practical exercises on the original battlefield, combining various arms of service. After blasting the stockades, sealing the bunkers, and deploying machine gun cover fire, the infantry advanced towards the enemy positions along the original routes, and the artillery also fired at the enemy from their original positions. Then, in units of companies and platoons, they conducted a review on sand tables, focusing on "situation, mission, plan, command, and action," reviewing tactical thinking, tactical command, and tactical actions.

From the assessment of the situation, on the one hand, it was observed that many commanders and fighters demonstrated the noble qualities of people's soldiers – a brave and tenacious fighting style and a spirit of fearlessly killing the enemy; on the other hand, shortcomings were also discovered, such as the weak commanding ability and low morale of a few comrades. During the review, the unit's leader took the lead in making two relatively deep and comprehensive self-criticisms. He pointed out that in the battle deployment, due to not having adequately studied the enemy situation and terrain, they failed to properly deploy forces, resulting in congestion and confusion in the troops, with the firepower positions and assault troops placed on the same line, and no one specifically responsible for commanding the firepower. These were all errors of empiricism from the guerrilla war era. In grasping the battlefield situation, due to not being able to promptly study the actual situation below, they failed to determine appropriate countermeasures based on the specific circumstances at the time. For example, a certain platoon had already circled to the enemy's rear and approached the enemy's pillbox very closely, and the enemy still thought it was their own troops, but due to the command not understanding the situation at the time, the platoon's mission was temporarily changed, and the platoon was ordered to withdraw, resulting in the loss of a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy. In tactical thinking, at that time, it was thought that as long as the firepower was deployed and a charge was made, the problem could be solved, without carefully studying tactics, not knowing how to combine the struggle of strength with the struggle of wits, relying only on momentary courage, and charging again and again if one charge failed, committing the error of "reckless charging and hard fighting."

When the unit's leader reviewed the root causes of the above errors, he pointed out that the first was underestimation of the enemy, thinking that with our superior forces, plus the close cooperation of neighboring units, annihilating the enemy would be as easy as turning one's hand; the second was eagerness for success, fearing that they would not be able to complete the task on time, thus neglecting certain necessary and possible preparatory work.

The unit leader's profound self-criticism, and the subsequent mass movement of self-criticism, criticism, and commendation by squad and platoon cadres and soldiers, elevated the thinking of all commanders and fighters in the unit. Through this serious review, all cadres deeply realized that overcoming subjective shortcomings existing in the unit could greatly reduce casualties in combat, thus greatly promoting a training upsurge.

### 西北某部创造提高战术方法　原阵地上检讨战斗  首长深刻自我批评指出经验主义错误

　　西北某部创造提高战术方法
    原阵地上检讨战斗
    首长深刻自我批评指出经验主义错误
    【新华社西北前线八日电】西北人民解放军某部，于黄龙山区南麓歼灭胡匪三十六师的胜利后，创造了在原来战场上进行实际演习的新的战斗检讨方法。该部于战役甫告结束，即在原来的战场上，作了各个兵种结合的实际演习。在爆炸鹿砦、封锁地堡、机枪掩护火力展开后，步兵按原来道路向敌阵地进击，炮兵也在原阵地向敌阵发射。然后以连、排为单位，在沙盘上进行“对情况、对任务、对计划、对指挥、对动作”的检讨方法，检讨了战术思想、战术指挥和战术动作。
    从对情况中，一方面看出许多指战员在战斗中表现了人民战士的高贵品质——英勇顽强的战斗作风与奋不顾身的杀敌精神；另一面也发现了少数同志指挥能力薄弱、斗志不强等缺点。在检讨中该部首长首先以自我批评的精神作了两次较深刻较全面的检讨。他指出：在战斗部署上由于没有很好地研究敌情、地形，致不能很好地布置兵力，部队拥挤、混乱，火力阵地与突击部队摆在一条线上，没有专人负责指挥火力。这些都是犯了游击战争时经验主义的错误。在掌握战场情况上，由于不能及时研究下面实际情况，致不能按当时具体情况决定适当对策。例如某排当时已经绕到敌人后侧，摸到距敌人碉堡很近的地方，敌人还以为是他们自己部队，但由于指挥上不了解当时情况，临时改变该排任务，并命令该排撤退下来，致失去歼敌良机。在战术思想上，当时认为只要火力一展开，一冲就可以解决问题，而不细心研究战术，不知斗力与斗智结合，只凭一时勇气，一次冲不上去再来一次，犯了“猛冲、硬拼”的错误。
    该部首长于检讨出上述错误的根源时，指出这首先是轻敌思想，认为我以优势兵力，加上友邻部队密切配合，消灭敌人，易如反掌；其次是急于求功，怕不能按时完成任务，因而忽视某些必要与可能的准备工作。
    该部首长的这一深刻检讨，以及随之而来的班排干部和战士的自我检讨、批评和表扬的群众运动，使该部全体指战员从思想上提高了一步。经过这次严肃的检讨，全体干部都深深体会到部队中存在着的主观上的缺点的克服，可以大大减少其作战中的伤亡，因而大大推动了练兵热潮。
