Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 11th: During the Battle to Liberate Jinan, the People's Liberation Army troops tasked with blocking enemy reinforcements displayed the same enthusiasm as the troops tasked with attacking the city. After the mobilization order was issued to a certain blocking unit, military and political cadres at all levels consciously recognized the important role of blocking reinforcements in the battle. They immediately carried out in-depth mobilization and actively prepared for battle.

At a discussion meeting of the "Model Assault Company" of a certain regiment, soldier Zhang Wenyu said: "In the past, we did a good job in assault warfare, but if it weren't for the good blocking actions of fraternal units, we wouldn't have been able to complete our missions." Company Commander Wang Tinghe said: "This time, we must defeat the enemies who might reinforce them, ensuring that the fraternal corps can capture Jinan, then we can concentrate our forces to eliminate the enemy." Each squad volunteered to take on the task of fighting tanks and launching attacks, aiming to create another model blocking company.

Many units were already discussing blocking war experiences during the march to the front lines. After arriving at the positions, they conducted on-site studies of the enemy's possible attack routes and our combat methods. Everyone was happy and active when constructing fortifications, making the fortifications both strong and practical. One company dug ×× bunkers, ××× individual shelters, and built × li of communication trenches in one day. The animal husbandry squad of a certain machine gun company also dug × anti-artillery shelters for the livestock, with troughs built inside.

During the construction of fortifications, each unit visited each other, offered suggestions for improvement. After a certain artillery company saw the fortifications of other units, they felt that their own camouflage was not well done, and they returned to improve it. The "Warrior News" of a certain regiment praised a squad that had done a good job in building fortifications, writing: "The two groups of the fourth squad are really working happily, not afraid of mud, not afraid of rain, taking off their clothes to work; the first and second groups are busy and sweating, and Instructor Liu also participates, so everyone is working even harder." Military and political cadres at all levels often supervised and inspected, personally inspected the positions, and studied improvements in the construction of fortifications.

　　解放济南战役中
    我阻击部队士气昂扬
    【新华社济南前线十一日电】解放济南战役中，受命准备阻击援敌的解放军与受命攻城的部队表现了同样的积极性。某阻击部队于动员令下达后，各级军政干部都自觉的认识到阻援在战役中的重大作用，即深入动员，积极备战。某团“攻坚模范连”座谈会上，战士张文玉说：“过去咱们攻坚打得好，但如不是兄弟部队阻击好，也不能完成任务。”连长王廷和说：“我们这次一定要把可能增援的敌人打垮，保证兄弟兵团打下济南，那时就可以集中力量来消灭敌人了。”各班均自报奋勇要求担任打坦克和出击的任务，再创造一个阻击模范连。许多单位早在开赴前线的行军中漫谈阻击战经验，进抵阵地后，即实地研究敌人可能的进攻道路和我们作战的方法。构筑工事时，大家都愉快积极，把工事作得又坚固又合用。某连一天挖了××个地堡、×××个单人掩体、打通了×里长的交通沟。某机枪连饲养班给牲口也挖了×个防炮洞，洞里修有食槽。各部在修工事时互相参观，互提改进意见，某炮兵连看了其他连队工事后，觉得自己的掩蔽还作得不好，回来后再予改进。某团“勇士报”表扬修工事修得好的一个班时写道：“四班两个组，干的真是欢，不怕泥，不怕雨，脱了衣服干；一组和二组，忙的满身汗，刘指导员也参加，大家更是加油干。”各级军政干部经常督促检查，亲自视察阵地，研究改进工事构筑。
