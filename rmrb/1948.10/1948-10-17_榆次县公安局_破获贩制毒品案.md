　　Yuchi County Public Security Bureau
  　Uncovers Drug Trafficking and Production Case
　　[Jinzhong Electric] On September 25th, the Yuchi County Public Security Bureau uncovered a major drug trafficking and production case. The main offender, Zhang Jixing, along with accomplices Zhang Jilan (Zhang Jixing's paternal aunt), Wang Shijie (Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau courier), and Zhang Zongliang (hooligan citizen), were all apprehended. Zhang Jixing, 28 years old, was from Yuchi city. He had been idle since childhood. During the Japanese occupation, he served as a traitor. During Yan Xishan's rule, he served as a police chief, village head of the Political Defense Corps, and worker for the Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau, a loyal accomplice of Yan Xishan, trafficking and producing drugs. For the past three years, he had been using his guise as a member of Yan Xishan's personnel to make contact in Taiyuan, trafficking back drugs to carry out organizational development and drug promotion activities in rural areas. Initially, he sold ready-made drug powder, but later bought machines and raw materials to manufacture them himself. At the beginning of the city's liberation, the Public Security Bureau received information about Zhang's drug trafficking and production. Zhang also registered with the Public Security Bureau, stating that he had worked for Yan Xishan and divulged his drug trafficking, expressing that he would no longer engage in such activities harmful to the people. However, he did not hand over the machines and continued to manufacture drugs in secret. At first, he did it at night in the basement, but later moved the machines to the house above to do it during the day. Finally, at 10 PM on September 25th, he was apprehended by our Public Security Bureau. When Zhang and others were arrested, three drug-making machines and some drug powder were found in his secret room. According to Zhang, within a month after liberation, he manufactured a total of ten blocks of drug powder, worth 3,500 silver dollars (equivalent to over 21 million Jicha banknotes). After several interrogations, it was confirmed that Zhang was indeed a loyal special agent and henchman of Yan Xishan, committing evil deeds by relying on Yan's power. After liberation, he refused to mend his ways and continued to harm the people. His crime is not light, and it is being prepared to be submitted to a higher court for legal action. Other accomplices, after repenting and reforming, have all been released.　　　　　　　　　　(Wang Yang)
