Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. The Kuomintang's crime of massacring Shanghai labor leader Wang Xiaohe has aroused protests from Shanghai workers. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Electrotechnical Agency on the 19th: Wang Xiaohe, chairman of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's trade union, was sentenced to death by the Kuomintang "Special Criminal Tribunal" on the pretext of "sabotaging machinery and attempting to create a situation of terror." Six other workers from the same company were sentenced to life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment. Upon hearing that Wang had been sentenced to death, the Shanghai electrical workers were extremely indignant, and 10,000 workers surrounded the Shanghai "Special Criminal Tribunal" demanding that Wang Xiaohe be allowed to appeal. The Electrotechnical Agency reported that Wang Xiaohe was shot on September 30. Before he was killed, he shouted, "I was elected by 28,000 workers, and they will avenge me!" Shanghai sources: Before Wang Xiaohe was murdered, the Shanghai underground trade union distributed pamphlets protesting the Kuomintang's crime of murdering their leader; seventy-eight civil servants also jointly submitted a letter protesting the criminal court's brutal killing of the trade union leader. When the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting in Harbin on the 10th of this month, it decided to issue a circular of protest, calling on workers and people from all walks of life across the country to unite in opposing this brutal crime by the Kuomintang, and decided to allocate funds to provide relief to the families of the victims and to express condolences to the workers and staff who are bravely struggling in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

    【新华社陕北廿五日电】国民党惨杀上海工人领袖王孝和的罪行，激起了上海工人的抗议。据电通社十九日上海电称：上海电力公司工会主席王孝和，被国民党“特种刑庭”以“破坏机器，图造成恐怖局面”为借口，判处死刑。同一公司的其他工人六名被处无期及有期徒刑。上海电力工人闻悉王被判死刑后，愤慨万分，一万工人包围上海“特种刑庭”，要求允许王孝和上诉。电通社报导：王孝和在九月三十日被枪杀。他在被杀之前高呼道：“我是二万八千工人选举出来的，他们将要替我复仇！”上海消息：王孝和被害前，上海秘密工会即散发小册子，对国民党这一杀害他们领袖的罪行提出抗议；七十八个公务员亦联合投书抗议该刑庭残杀工会领袖的罪恶判决。全国总工会执行委员会于本月十日在哈尔滨举行会议时决议通电抗议，号召全国工人和各界人士一致反对国民党这一残暴罪行，并决定拨款救济被难者家属及向在国民党统治区坚持英勇斗争的职工表示慰问。
