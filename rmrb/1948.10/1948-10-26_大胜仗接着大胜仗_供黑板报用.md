　　Great Victory Followed by Great Victory
  　For Blackboard Newspapers
　　These past few days, the People's Liberation Army has been winning battles everywhere, with one victory closely following another. On the 22nd, Zhengzhou was liberated. The enemy fled north in a panic. Our army caught up and engaged them, completely wiping out one division, killing and wounding over a thousand, and capturing seven thousand. Having seized the Yellow River Railway Bridge, we also occupied Zhongmou County to the east. On the very same day, two more large cities returned to us: Kaifeng was taken for the second time, the defending enemy fleeing east; and Baotou in Suiyuan was captured, the defending enemy fleeing west. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are in total disarray, fleeing east, west, north, and south. No matter where they flee, they will ultimately be annihilated by us. Comrades, fellow villagers, let's gather our strength and work harder! The army continues to advance, and the rear areas should focus on production. With the Party, government, army, and people united as one, we will fully support the front lines! "Advance on Taiyuan, capture Yan Xishan alive!" "Liberate all of North China, liberate all of Central China!"

　　大胜仗接着大胜仗
  　供黑板报用
    解放军，这几天，到处胜仗打得欢，一个个胜利紧相连；二十二号解放郑州城，敌人慌忙往北窜，我军追上扭住打，一个师全部消灭完，打死打伤一千多，活捉俘虏有七千。占了黄河大铁桥，东边又占中牟县。就在这，同一天，又两个大城归了咱：二次打下开封城，守城敌人往东窜；绥远打下包头市，守城敌人往西窜；蒋匪到处大混乱，东窜西窜南北窜；不管他往那里窜，末了总要叫咱消灭完。同志们，老乡们，鼓起劲，加油干，军队继续向前进，后方好好闹生产，党政军民一条心，全力支援最前线！“打到太原去，活捉阎锡山！”“解放全华北，解放全中原！”
