Pingshan Deeply Promotes the "72" Wheat Variety

[North Yue News] The agricultural extension field of the Pingshan County Production Promotion Cooperative is deeply promoting the "72" wheat variety. The method is to exchange other wheat for "72" wheat seeds, one pound for one pound, and for every ten pounds, a packet of medicine to prevent black blight is given. The exchanges are being carried out in Pingshan City and Donghuishe. The county government and the Promotion Cooperative wrote more than a dozen advertisements and posted them at various key intersections, and also distributed publicity at the Donghuishe market. Many people raised the question, "What you say sounds good, but we haven't seen it," expressing disbelief. The farm technicians explained in detail the characteristics of the "72" wheat, such as its short and thick grains, no awns, and thick and hard stalks. They also took the "72" wheat specimens left over from the farm's wheat harvest and the newly transported wheat seeds to show the masses. When the masses saw the thick and uniform wheat seeds, some people thought it was "Pingyangfu" wheat and were afraid it would be difficult to sell, expressing hesitation (someone near here had planted "Pingyangfu" wheat, which yielded a lot but was slightly black and difficult to sell). Liu Yuanling and the Promotion Branch explained that "72" wheat has no awns, while "Pingyangfu" wheat has awns, and the ear is hexagonal, which dispelled all the concerns of the masses. When promoting in the South Gate of Pingshan City, Li Shiying, a grain broker from Dongguan, also helped with the promotion based on his own experience, which had a great effect. In addition to introducing the advantages of the wheat in detail, the shortcoming of "weak gluten" was also explained. The masses responded, "As long as it yields a lot and is easy to sell, a little less gluten doesn't matter." After in-depth publicity, the masses exchanged enthusiastically. After the market publicity in Pingshan City, more than 1,000 jin were exchanged in one day the next day. Within three days of the start of the exchange, 5,600 jin had been exchanged. People are still coming to exchange. The county cooperative exchanged 1,042 jin in the second district of Donghuishe to six or seven villages including this village, Nanwanglou, and Hexi in the sixth district. The workers of each division of the Promotion Cooperative registered one after another, requesting to exchange some to take home for trial planting. Other districts are preparing to first have the Promotion Cooperative cadres take the lead in trial planting to prepare for promotion next year. According to statistics in just three or four days, a total of more than 6,600 jin were exchanged in both places, accounting for 84 percent of what the administrative office allocated. It is estimated that all will be exchanged soon. When exchanging, the masses compared the wheat they brought with the "72" wheat, and their confidence in the new wheat seeds was even higher. Wang Liande and Wang Yuzhu from Chuanfang said, "The government is spending so much effort and paying for travel expenses just to get us to grow more grain." Those who exchanged were very happy. When the cooperative explained that each ten jin of wheat seeds would come with a small packet of black blight prevention medicine without charging the medicine fee, the masses were even happier. They said, "We exchanged for good wheat seeds, and we get free medicine, the government is really serving the people!"

　　平山深入宣传推广七二麦种
    【北岳讯】平山县生产推进社农事推广场，深入推广“七二”小麦种。办法是用其他麦子换“七二”麦种，一斤换一斤，每十斤送给防黑疸的药一包，分于平山城、东回舍两处兑换。县府和推进社一方面写了十几张广告贴于各要路口，一方面在东回舍集上分摊宣传。有不少人提出“你们说的挺好，俺们没见过”，即表示不大相信，农场技术员即将“七二”小麦麦粒短粗、无芒、秸梗粗硬的特点详加说明，并将农场麦收时留下的“七二”小麦标本及新运来的麦种拿去给群众看。群众看到了又粗肥，又整齐的麦种，又有人认为是“平阳府”麦子，怕不好出手，表示犹疑（“平阳府”麦子附近曾有人种，打的多，色稍黑，不好出卖）。刘元灵与推进分社又将“七二”麦无芒，“平阳府”麦有芒，穗是六棱的加以解释，群众顾虑才全部打消。在平山城南关宣传时，东关粮食经纪李世英也根据亲身经验帮助宣传，作用很大。宣传时除将该麦优点详加介绍外，同时也说明了“面劲小”的缺点，群众反映说：“只要打的多，好出手就行，面劲小点不要紧。”经过深入宣传，群众换的很踊跃，平山城集市宣传后，第二天一天换了千余斤。兑换开始没三天，即兑出了五千六百余斤。现仍不断有人来换。县社在二区东回舍换给本村、南望楼、六区河西等六、七村一千零四十二斤。推进社各股工人纷纷登记，要求换一部回家试种，其他各区准备先由推进社干部带头试种，以备明年推广。仅三四天统计，两处共换出六千六百多斤，占行署拨来的百分之八十四，估计不日即可全部换完。换时群众将自己带来的麦子和“七二”麦一比，对新麦种信心更高了。川坊王连德、王玉珠说：“公家费这么大劲，赔上路费，就是为叫咱们多打粮食。”换到的人都很高兴。当社里说明每十斤麦种随带一小包防黑疸药不收药费后，群众更高兴了，他们说：“换了好麦种，还白给药，公家真是为咱人民服务哩！”
