Battle of Jinan
Frontline Dispatches

    Seizing Yanchi Mountain

	A group of cliffs and precipices rise in the southern suburbs of Jinan. Wang Yaowu built his so-called first "solid defense line" here. Yanchi Mountain is one of them. It faces Qianfo Mountain with twin peaks. Atop the mountain are bunker fortifications surrounding the peak, guarding the southern entrance of Jinan.

	At 1:00 AM on September 17th, the Second Company of a certain unit, tasked with "resolutely capturing Yanchi Mountain," moved into position, dispatching the Sixth Squad to conduct reconnaissance, search, and destroy secondary fortifications. Soldier Yu Tianmin was ordered to blow up a "scattered bunker" in front. The enemy was still asleep. Yu Tianmin threw in two hand grenades one after another. The enemy fled in panic. At this time, the enemy in front continuously threw hand grenades. The squad leader and two soldiers were injured, but none of them were willing to leave the line of fire, because the task was not completed. The squad leader initially rolled on the ground, dodging the hand grenades constantly landing beside him. But he suddenly thought, "This is passive defense," and suddenly jumped up from the ground, rushing forward to drive away the enemy's lurking soldiers with a burst of submachine gun fire. Finally, he completed the search and demolition task of a ×× meter distance.

	The First Squad, responsible for blasting the enemy's group fortifications, began continuous blasting, but it did not work, and the enemy's firepower had formed a web of fire that was firing fiercely and counterattacking. At this time, the Second Platoon machine gun squad leader—a third-class disabled soldier, Zhang Jinxia—said: "Comrades! Persist to the end, never take a step back!" The enemy's several counterattacks were finally defeated.

	Under the moonlight, the soldiers clearly saw the city of Jinan—victory was approaching. The wounded comrades bandaged their wounds and crawled up from the ground; the instructor, with injuries, organized the team and firmly exhorted: "Even if it's the last person, we must resolutely complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and the people."

	Half an hour later, under heavy artillery fire, the blasting restarted, but it still did not work. The enemy counterattacked again and was beaten back... Deputy Company Commander Yang Honggui and the instructor were both injured twice. At this critical moment, the instructor solemnly handed the blasting task to Comrade Sun Ben, the deputy of the Second Squad, and said to him: "You are an excellent Communist Party member, you must complete this task."

	The third blasting began. A meter and a half thick bunker fortification was finally blown a large hole, and the assault team rushed up at lightning speed. Yanchi Mountain became the tomb of the Third Battalion of the 77th Brigade of the defending enemy.

	In the faint morning light, the soldiers stood on the towering Yanchi Mountain, looking at the city of Jinan, and cheered victoriously.

    Entering the Commercial District

	This is a corner of the battlefield in the battle to enter the northern part of the Commercial District, in the regimental headquarters inside a bunker.

	Telephones from all over reported: "Preparations are complete, awaiting orders." Regiment Commander Wang seriously and nervously picked up the telephone receiver and announced loudly:

	"Attack begins!"

	Outside, in the moonlit night sky, as the signal flares went up, the People's Liberation Army's artillery roared in unison. All the staff officers, guards, and messengers in the command post excitedly ran outside to observe. They ran in and out nervously. Regiment Commander Wang held the telephone receiver all the time: "Hello, how's the artillery fire? Hello, telephone operator, keep the receiver in your hand, don't put it down. What! The mountain guns are firing well?" "Hello..."

	The northern corner of the commercial district was completely shrouded in the smoke of artillery fire. The enemy's gunfire was sparse. Suddenly, there were a few loud rumbles, and the people in the command post shouted with interest. Regiment Commander Wang shouted loudly: "Quickly fire a signal flare, assault!" Then he shouted into the phone: "Everyone pick up the receivers, don't put them down... Hello, artillery! Extend the firing ×× meters from the breach. Did you see the signal? The assault team is starting to charge!"

	Outside, the explosions of the People's Liberation Army's shells were farther away. The assault team was charging, and tense and dense gunfire was heard.

	No one in the entire command post spoke; everyone held their breath. The flickering, weak oil lamp shone on each person's tense face. The bunker was damp. At this time, a small frog ran out from some corner, jumped onto the map spread out under the lamp, and no one paid any attention to it. Everyone's heart flew to the breach at this moment.

	The phone rang, and an enthusiastic and anxious voice came:

	"× Company has broken through!"

	Wiping a handful of sweat, Regiment Commander Wang grinned. Everyone in the command post breathed a sigh of relief. At this time, at the breach in the enemy's position, the People's Liberation Army was surging in like a tide, developing into the depths of the commercial district.

    Seizing the Second Pacification Zone Headquarters

	On the evening of the 21st, the People's Liberation Army began to attack Wang Yaowu's Second Pacification Zone Headquarters on Weier Road, Erda Ma Road in the commercial district. This was the final battle to clear the commercial district.

	This was a large building complex consisting of more than a dozen tall Western-style buildings, reinforced concrete, covering an area of about one square kilometer. The wide roads on all sides were controlled by large bunkers extending from inside the walls and underground. On the roof were concrete-built light and heavy firepower shelters, with three mountain guns and countless light and heavy machine gun positions. In the courtyard, the entrances of the buildings had bunkers, the windows of the buildings were blocked, and gun holes were densely arranged, with more than one hundred machine gun nests and more than one thousand rifle firing holes, forming layers of fire nets between buildings and upstairs and downstairs. The defending enemy, the 172nd Regiment of the entire 74th Division, was stubbornly resisting.

	From about 8:00 PM, the building was submerged in the deafening roar and smoke of the People's Liberation Army, and the rumbling of artillery continued for two hours. At exactly 10:00 PM, the brave assault team rushed into the wall from the breaches on the north, west, and south sides. The × Company that first rushed in had just occupied one position in the building when the enemy immediately counterattacked from upstairs, underground, and in all directions, launching a fierce melee. Nie Guangsheng, the platoon leader of the company, fell to the ground wounded, but still shouted: "Maintain our glory, hold the breach!" The enemy's four counterattacks were all miserably defeated in front of the People's Liberation Army's bayonets. Another route of the People's Liberation Army rushed into the courtyard, and the enemy threw hand grenades and mortar shells from upstairs, and shamelessly threw poison gas bombs. The angry people's fighters immediately beat the poison-releasing enemy to the point where they could not lift their heads with a storm of firepower. Another assault team rushed into a building, and the enemy threw poison gas bombs from upstairs. The assault team waited for the poison gas to dissipate before rushing in again, using hand grenades to knock the enemy upstairs down the stairs.

	The enemy relied on all possible fortifications to stubbornly resist, even throwing tables, chairs, sofas, bags of foreign flour, or bundles of archives and documents into the corridors to try to stop our assault team from advancing. Our rocket artillerymen and demolition experts showed their great power, quickly destroying the enemy's building fortifications one after another, opening up a path for the brave men of the assault team to advance.

	Fierce fighting broke out in every building. The battle was conducted room by room, floor by floor, and house by house. With unparalleled courage and wit, the assault team members repelled the enemy's counterattacks from above, below, front, and rear one by one, and finally compressed the enemy into a small corner and annihilated them. At one building entrance, there were three enemy machine guns. Soldiers Tang Lifu and Jiao Jingxuan lay down and rolled up the stairs one by one, violently grabbing the enemy's machine guns and throwing them down. Our assault heroes then swarmed up the stairs and eliminated the enemy upstairs.

	When the situation was obviously hopeless, the barbaric enemy officers still used submachine guns to drive the soldiers who were hiding in the rooms and unwilling to fight anymore out to counterattack. When nine heroes of a certain unit rushed to the last large building—Wang Yaowu's office—squad leader Zhao Qianshun found three machine guns set up in front of him. He rushed forward and found an enemy officer holding a submachine gun behind the door supervising the battle. The agile Squad Leader Zhao immediately shot and killed the officer with two shots. All the enemies in the building clapped their hands and surrendered. In another room, the enemy had replied that they would surrender after our calls, but they did not come out. Our soldier Guo Yuke quickly detoured to the back door and shot down several enemy officers who were not allowing the soldiers to surrender, and the rest immediately laid down their weapons.

	After a fierce battle of one dark night and half a day, on the afternoon of the 22nd, the brave assault team rushed to the roof of the last building, and the dazed enemy artillerymen obediently became prisoners. The enemy had been completely annihilated, and the assault forces from all directions victoriously met on the roof amidst cheers.

    The Final Battle—Annihilating Wang Yaowu's Headquarters

	After eliminating the defending enemies building by building and bunker by bunker, the iron pincers of the People's Liberation Army, which had stormed into the inner city of Jinan, finally converged on the Shandong Provincial Government, where Wang Yaowu's headquarters was located. All the tanks and armored vehicles of the enemy tank battalion guarding the provincial government struggled to counterattack on the burning streets, but under the fierce artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army, one, two, and three were destroyed and captured. Thick smoke enveloped the sky, and rooms, bunkers, trees, electric poles... were all being shaken and collapsing.

	At this time, the Second Battalion of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, under the battle slogans of "Fight to the Provincial Government, capture Wang Yaowu alive" and "Wherever there are enemies, fight to them," swiftly rushed through several walls and fought to the front of the Provincial Government gate. A heavy machine gun and two light machine guns of the Third Platoon of the Fifth Company sealed off the "Zhengyang Gate." The assault team's submachine guns fired fiercely in front, and the small cannons quickly followed up and fired into the inner courtyard. In the kitchen, enemy officers and soldiers surrendered more than thirty rifles. Far behind the Fifth Company, thirty-eight enemies came from the west courtyard gate and surrendered to the neighboring units.

	The Third Platoon went straight to the "Chairman's Office." When Deputy Platoon Leader Wang Jinxiang leaped into the courtyard to the side of the electric pole among several trees, an enemy crawled out from the sandbag fortification under the electric pole and said: "Don't shoot, don't shoot, there are people here!" The deputy platoon leader quickly pointed his Thompson submachine gun at the underground basement entrance behind the sandbag fortification, and carbines, Mauser pistols, and ammunition pouches were handed out from the basement one after another. At this time, fraternal units had already fought in from the front, rear, left, and right, and the remnant enemies who were resisting stubbornly outside the basement had been cleared. In the basement, Wang Yaowu's Major General Chief of Staff Luo Xinli and Zhang Jieren, the Major General Director of the Fourth Department of the Second Pacification Zone, sent the Shandong Provincial Government's chief of general affairs to negotiate surrender. Our Battalion Commander Li Youzhang ordered them all to stand out.

	Wang Yaowu's command post surrendered. Jinan was completely liberated. This was exactly 6:00 PM on September 24th.

　　解放济南之战
    前线通讯
    攻占燕翅山
    在济南的南郊崛起一群悬崖峭壁的山峰，王耀武在这里构筑了所谓第一道“坚固防线”，燕翅山是其中之一，她和千佛山双峰相对，山头上筑有围绕着山峰的夹壁工事，扼守着济南南方的进口。
    九月十七日晨一时，受命“坚决攻下燕翅山”的某部二连运动到作业位置，派出六班去进行侦察、搜索和破坏副设工事。战士于天民奉命去爆破前面的一个“散堡”。敌人还在梦中，于天民先后投进去了两个手榴弹，敌人在惊慌中狼狈逃跑了。这时前面的敌人不断投过来手榴弹。班长和两个战士受伤了，但谁也不肯下火线，因为任务未完成。班长起初在地上滚着，躲避不断落在身边的手榴弹。但他一转念间想到“这是消极的防御”，猛然从地上跳起，迎着冲上去，一阵冲锋枪打跑了敌人潜伏的散兵。终于完成了××米距离的搜索和爆破任务。
    担任爆破敌人集团工事的一班开始连续爆破，但却没有奏效，而敌人火力已构成火网在猛射着，并进行反冲锋。这时二排机枪班长——三等残废张金夏说：“同志们！坚持到底，决不后退一步！”敌人几次反击，终于被打垮了。
    月光下战士们清楚地看见了济南城——胜利迫近了。受伤的同志包好了自己的伤口，从地上爬起来；指导员带着伤组织好队伍，坚定地号召说：“打到最后一个人，也要坚决完成党和人民交给我们的光荣任务。”
    半点钟后，在猛烈的炮火下，爆破重新开始，但依然没有奏效，敌人反冲锋过来，又被打回去………副连长杨洪贵和指导员都两次受伤了。就在这紧张的关头，指导员严肃地把爆破任务交给二班副孙本同志，对他说：“你是优秀的共产党员，你必须完成这个任务。”
    第三次爆破开始了。一米五厚的夹壁工事，终于被炸破了一个大窟窿，突击队飞速地冲上去，燕翅山成了守敌七十七旅三营的坟墓。
    晨光熹微中，战士们在矗立的燕翅山上，了望济南城，胜利地欢呼着。
    打进商埠区
    这是在打进商埠区北卡子之战中战场的一角，是在地堡中的团指挥所里。
    各处电话都传来：“准备完成，听候命令”了，王团长严肃而紧张地拿起电话耳机来，大声宣布：
    “攻击开始！”
    外面，月色朦胧的夜空里，随着信号弹的飞起，解放军的大炮一齐轰鸣起来。指挥所里所有的参谋人员、警卫员、通讯员等都兴奋地跑到外面去观察。他们紧张地跑进跑出，王团长则一直拿着电话耳机：“喂，炮打的怎样？喂，电话员，耳机要拿在手里，不许放下。怎么！山炮打得很好？”“喂………”
    商埠区的北角完全笼罩在炮火的硝烟下。敌人的枪炮声稀稀落落的。忽然传来了几声隆隆巨响，指挥所里的人都感觉兴趣地喊叫起来。王团长大声喊叫：“快打信号弹，突击！”接着他向电话里叫道：“所有的耳机子统统拿起来，不要放下。……喂，炮兵！由突破口延伸××米射击。你们看见信号了吗？突击队开始冲锋了！”
    外面，解放军的炮弹爆炸声远些了。突击队正在冲锋，传来了紧张而稠密的枪声。
    整个指挥所里没有一个人说话，大家都屏息着。闪闪的，微弱的油灯，照着每人一张紧张的面孔。地堡是潮湿的，这时，不知从哪个角落里跑出来一只小青蛙，跳到了灯下展开的地图上，谁也没有去管它。每个人的心此刻都飞到突破口去了。
    电话响了，传来了热情而急燥的声音：
    “×连已突进去了！”
    揩了一把汗，王团长裂开嘴笑了。指挥所中所有的人都松了一口气。这时，在敌阵的突破口上，解放军正象潮水一样涌进去，向商埠的纵深发展。
    争夺第二绥区司令部
    二十一日晚，解放军开始攻击商埠区二大马路纬二路上王耀武的第二绥靖区司令部。这是肃清商埠区的最后一战。
    这是由十几幢高大洋楼组成的大厦，钢骨水泥，面积约一方公里。四面宽阔的马路，都有从墙内、地下伸出的大地堡控制着。楼顶上是水泥筑成的轻重火力掩体，有三门山炮和无数轻重机枪阵地。院内楼房门口都有地堡，楼房窗户堵塞，枪眼密布，共有一百多机枪火力巢和一千多步枪射击孔，构成了楼与楼间、楼上楼下层层的火力网。守敌整七十四师一七二团在顽抗着。
    从晚上八时许起，大厦淹没在解放军的震耳欲聋的巨响和硝烟中，隆隆的炮声连续了两小时。十点正，勇猛的突击队就从北、西、南三面的突破口冲进了围墙。首先冲入的×连刚占领楼房阵地一处，敌人就立刻从楼上、地下，四面八方反扑过来，展开了惨烈的肉搏战。该连排长聂光胜负伤倒地，还高喊：“保持我们的光荣，守住突破口！”敌人的四次反扑，都在解放军的白刃前面惨败了。另路解放军突入院内时，敌人从楼上向下乱抛手榴弹和迫击炮弹，并无耻地投下毒气弹。愤怒的人民战士，立即以急风暴雨般的火力把放毒敌人打得抬不起头。另一个突击队突进了一座楼房，敌人从楼上抛下毒气弹，突击队等毒气消散后又突进去，用手榴弹把楼上的敌人打得滚下楼来。
    敌人依靠着一切可能利用的工事进行顽抗，甚至将桌、椅、沙发、成袋洋面、或是成捆的档案、文件向走廊乱抛，图阻止我突击队前进。我火箭炮手和爆破手大显神威，一处又一处地迅速摧毁敌人的楼房工事，为突击队勇士们开辟前进道路。
    每座楼房里都激烈地打起来。战斗是逐屋、逐层、逐房地进行着。突击队员们以无比的勇猛机智逐一打退敌人上下前后的反扑，最后把敌人压缩在一个小角落里，予以歼灭。在一个楼口，有敌人三挺机枪，战士唐立馥、焦京轩就卧倒从楼梯一级级地滚上去，猛力抓住敌人机枪摔下来。我突击健儿随即蜂拥冲上楼去，解决了楼上的敌人。
    当情况显然已经绝望时，野蛮的敌军军官，仍然用冲锋枪把躲在房里不愿再打的士兵们赶出来反扑。当某部九个勇士突到最后一座大楼——王耀武的办公厅时，班长赵千顺发现前面架着三挺机枪，他扑上去又发现一个敌军军官端着冲锋枪在门后督战。敏捷的赵班长立即两枪打死了那个军官，满楼的敌军都拍着手出来缴了械。另一间房内敌人在我喊话下已答复缴械，但却不见出来。我战士郭玉可迅速绕至屋后小门，一梭子弹打倒了几个不准士兵缴械的敌军官，其余即全部放下了武器。
    经过了一个黑夜和半个白天的激烈战斗后，二十二日下午，勇猛的突击队冲上了最后一幢楼房的楼顶，吓呆了的敌军炮兵就驯服地当了俘虏。敌人已全部歼灭，各路突击部队于欢呼声中在楼顶胜利会师。
    最后一战——歼灭王耀武指挥所
    经过逐楼逐堡地消灭了守敌之后，解放军攻入济南内城的各路铁钳，最后向王耀武指挥所所在地的山东省政府合拢起来。守护省政府的敌战车营的所有坦克、装甲车在烈火熊熊的街道上作反扑挣扎，但在解放军猛烈炮火下，一辆二辆三辆地被击毁着、被俘获着。浓烟笼罩上空，四处房间、地堡、树木、电杆……都在被震撼、倾塌着。
    这时解放军某团二营，在“打到省政府，活捉王耀武”，“哪里有敌人，打到哪里去”的战斗口号下，神速地冲过几道墙壁，打到了省政府的大门前。五连三排的一挺重机枪和两挺轻机枪封锁了“正阳大门”，突击队的冲锋枪在前面哗哗地猛射，小炮飞快地跟上去打进内院，厨房里敌军官兵交出了卅多条步枪。远在五连的后尾，从西院门过来卅八个敌人，向友邻部队缴械请降。
    三排直扑“主席办公室”。当副排长王金香跃身插进院里几棵树中间的电杆边时，一个敌人从电杆下麻袋工事里钻出来说：“别打别打，这里有人！”副排长迅速地将汤姆枪对准麻袋工事后面的地下室洞口，从地下室里纷纷交出了卡宾、驳壳和子弹袋。这时兄弟部队已从前后左右打进来，地下室外负隅抵抗的残敌已肃清了。地下室里王耀武的少将参谋长罗辛理、第二绥区第四处少将处长张介人，派山东省政府简任总务长出来接洽投降。我李友章营长命令他们都站出来。
    王耀武的指挥部投降了。济南乃告全部解放。这正是九月二十四日下午六时。
