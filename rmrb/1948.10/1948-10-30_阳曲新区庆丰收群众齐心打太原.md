　　[Jinzhong Electric] The masses in the Yangqu New District are universally celebrating the bumper harvest, and the entire population is engaged in intense autumn harvesting to support the front lines. The seventh and ninth districts of the county are both well-known grain-producing areas, but after years of exploitation by the Japanese and Yan [Xishan], they became impoverished and desolate disaster areas. Nearly a thousand people died from disaster, illness, freezing, and starvation, and those who survived mostly eked out a miserable existence with bran, vegetables, and wild grasses. "The People's Liberation Army coming here will not only change the world for the better, but also make the years better!" This is the widely circulated good news among the people there. According to local veteran farmers: When the Japanese and Yan's army was here, they disrupted the people's production, and people and livestock were constantly conscripted for labor. Fertilizer was not applied to the fields, and coupled with drought, floods, and hailstorms, the harvest was only 20-30% each year. Sorghum suffered from black jaundice, yielding only three or four dou (market dou, same below) per mu, and millet yielded only two or three dou of chaff per mu. Even then, we had to hand over as much as possible. After liberation in July this year, the government led the masses to resume production, and with favorable weather, the masses rushed to hoe the autumn seedlings and universally replanted buckwheat. (According to local custom, the masses did not usually replant after the wheat harvest, but this year, under the government's loan of seeds, they rushed to plant a lot.) The hoed land can produce three or four shi of sorghum and millet per mu, and each dou of millet can yield six sheng of rice (last year it was two or three sheng). The yield of millet and buckwheat is even better. According to local estimates, this year's harvest is generally 70% of a normal year. The bumper autumn harvest, coupled with the attack on Taiyuan, is a double blessing. The people there are extremely excited. After a large number of men went to the front lines, the care of the wounded, the mobilization of equipment, and the requisition of public grain in the rear, as well as the harvesting, cutting, carrying, transporting, threshing, drying, grinding, and milling in the autumn harvest, were mostly undertaken by the broad masses of women, children, and old men. More than 90% of the women in each village went to the fields for the autumn harvest. They can freely form groups according to streets or neighbors, and engage in mutual aid for the autumn harvest in groups of three or five. The reporter personally saw many young and middle-aged women in the fields carrying four or five bundles of grain and hay on their backs, walking like men. They happily said: "In the past, when we heard gunfire, we were so scared that we trembled. Now, when we hear gunfire, we are overjoyed. The louder it is, the more energetically we harvest." The masses in villages such as Daquangou, Beibaicun, Lijia Gou, and Youjiazhai helped the families of the mobilized laborers harvest 570 mu of crops. As of the 14th of this month, 95% of the crops in the fields of each village, except for a small part of broad beans, have been harvested and returned to the threshing ground. Recently, the mills in each village have been running day and night, and the masses are working day and night to thresh and dry the grain in order to rush to hand over the public grain.

　　阳曲新区庆丰收群众齐心打太原
    【晋中电】阳曲新区群众普庆丰收，全民紧张秋收支前。该县七、九两区，均属有名的产粮区，但经日阎长年压榨，变成穷困荒凉的大灾区。群众因灾病冻饿而死者近千人，留命者多以糠菜野草熬度苦日。“人民解放军开到那里不仅能把世道变好，还能把年头也变好！”这是该地人民盛传的喜讯。据当地老农称：日阎军在时，闹的人民不能生产，人和牲口常支差，粪土上不在地里，再加旱涝风雹，年年是二三成收。高粱因黑疸每亩仅仅收三、四斗（市斗下同），每亩谷亦仅收二三斗秕谷。就这样还得打多少交多少。今年七月间解放后，政府领导群众恢复生产，又加风调雨顺，群众又赶着锄了秋苗，普遍的回茬了荞麦。（按当地往年麦收后群众本无回茬习惯，今年在政府贷籽组织下，抢种很多。）锄过的地高粱和谷子每亩可产石三四，每斗谷可推六升米（去年是二、三升），糜黍荞麦尤佳。据当地群众估计，今年均匀有七成年景。秋粮丰收又加攻打太原，双喜临门，该地人民兴奋万分，当大批男子出征前方后，后方的照应伤员、动员器材，征借公粮，与秋收中的收、割、背、运、打、晒、推、碾等，多由广大妇女儿童老汉们担负起来，各村下地秋收的妇女，皆在百分之九十以上。她们能按街道或按地邻自由结组，三五成伙的变工秋收。记者于田间亲见不少青壮年妇女，背挑四五捆谷、茭，行走如男子。他们欢喜的说：“过去听见机枪响，吓的打抖哩，如今听见机枪响，喜的上天哩，它响的越厉害，俺们割得越有劲。”大泉沟、北白村、李家沟、游家寨等村群众，并帮助出征民工家属收割庄稼五七○亩，截至本月十四号，该地各村的田禾除少部茭豆外，百分之九十五已收割回场。近日各村碾磨昼夜不停，群众正星夜打晒，赶交公粮。
