　　[Special dispatch from this newspaper] In order to respond to the call of the Chinese people’s leader Chairman Mao: “Increase production by an inch,” so as to more effectively support the revolutionary war, the North China Regional Finance Conference was held on September 3rd in a certain place in North China. The attendees included directors of administrative offices from various regions, directors of finance departments (bureaus), the director of the North China Taxation Bureau, section chiefs of special counties, and cadres above the section chief level of the Finance Department, totaling more than 80 people. The North China Bank, the Logistics Command of the North China Military Region, the People's Armed Forces Department, the Supply Department, and the North China Trading Company all sent representatives to participate. The conference was presided over by Rong Zihe, former Vice Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and current Minister of Finance of the North China Government, and Wu Bo, Deputy Minister of Finance of the North China Government. The conference lasted for more than ten days, discussing more than ten topics including the North China financial and administrative policy, new agricultural tax regulations, industrial and commercial tax, tobacco and alcohol tax laws, audit regulations, grain depot system, and war support issues. It drafted a preliminary budget for financial revenue and expenditure for 1949 and opinions on the allocation of agricultural tax, industrial and commercial tax, and other tax revenue tasks for various regions, and submitted them to the North China People’s Government Committee for review. The conference adopted a combination of plenary sessions, group meetings, specialized research meetings, and investigation meetings, and the discussions were quite lively, demonstrating the spirit of responsibility to the people of all participants. The most debated issues were the revenue and expenditure budget, the allocation of agricultural tax tasks, and the financial and administrative policy. Finally, Minister Rong delivered a concluding speech, and the conference closed successfully on the 19th.

　　The conference first discussed the new agricultural tax regulations, which were approved in principle by the North China Provisional People’s Congress. It unanimously agreed that the unified progressive agricultural tax adopted before the land reform played a significant role in taking care of the affordability of all classes, weakening feudalism, increasing tax revenue, and ensuring supply, and was completely correct. However, after the land reform, the land of farmers was generally equal. If progressive taxation were to be implemented again, it would not be entirely reasonable and might hinder the development of production. The new agricultural tax regulations stipulate that taxes should be levied proportionally without progression, which is in line with the reality. Furthermore, although the land is equally divided, there are still some differences. To take care of poor villages and farmers with low incomes, the new tax regulations also stipulate a tax exemption point of one standard mu per person (i.e., ten shi of grain). In particular, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, widows, widowers, and orphans who are poor and have no labor force will be given an additional tax exemption point of half a standard mu, which is completely reasonable and necessary. At the same time, the new tax regulations stipulate that the yield is calculated based on the normal annual yield. The yield of special crops (such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and indigo) is calculated in terms of grain. The increased yield due to diligent processing and improved technology will not be taxed, and the reduced yield due to laziness will not be reduced. This encourages diligence, getting rich, and prospering the family, which is a method of incorporating incentives into taxation. It also stipulates that the amount of burden should be fixed for villages that accurately report their yields, which will play a great role in stabilizing farmers' production enthusiasm and increasing production. However, the implementation of the new tax regulations is an extremely meticulous and arduous task, especially the assessment of yields. If sufficient effort is not made, it will create new and greater imbalances. The conference suggested that the North China People's Government should promptly promulgate regulations for assessing the standard mu of normal annual yield, and that administrative offices should dispatch a large number of experienced and capable cadres to form agricultural tax assessment yield work teams, which would go to various regions to conduct typical investigations to promote the entire region.

　　When discussing industrial and commercial tax and various tax laws, the conference believed that the progressive collection of industrial and commercial tax, with the highest tax rate not exceeding 25% of net income, and industry being taxed less than commerce, is in line with the principle of protecting industry and commerce. In terms of assessment and evaluation, the method of collecting monthly or quarterly, self-reporting and public discussion by industry and trade, changing the past method of checking accounts and inventories, enables industrial and commercial operators to develop their businesses with peace of mind, which is beneficial to the prosperity of the economy. However, it also criticized some comrades for overemphasizing the protection of industry and commerce, making excessive concessions to private industrial and commercial businesses, and even daring not or unwilling to levy taxes. For example, Jizhong deployed the collection of industrial and commercial tax, only collecting one-third of last year's amount in currency (which is actually one-ninth in terms of price), ignoring the aspect of guaranteeing war supply, and also ignoring the leadership of state-owned enterprises. The idea of unilaterally emphasizing the protection of industry and commerce is wrong. The conference believed that in order to support the war, it is very necessary to appropriately balance the burden of agriculture, industry, and commerce, to reorganize industrial and commercial tax revenue, and to rationally open up other tax sources. The conference suggested that in addition to revising the tobacco, alcohol, industrial and commercial tax, and transaction tax, the North China People's Government should add a commodity production and sales tax and a stamp tax, and strengthen the tax authorities. In this way, the tax revenue can be increased three times compared with the past, accounting for one-sixth of the annual income, relatively reducing the burden on farmers.

　　On the fifth day, when the conference discussed the regional financial and administrative system, strengthening centralized unification and the financial decentralized system, the debate was quite heated. Finally, it was unanimously agreed that in view of the requirements for the development of production and the current war situation, it is necessary to strengthen centralized unification in the context of financial difficulties and use all forces for the war. After strengthening centralized unification, in order to avoid the problem of untimely resolution of problems below and affecting the enthusiasm of local organizations in generating income, it was decided that the annual budget of each administrative office could be allocated at one time after being approved by the North China People's Government, and a certain amount of reserve funds would be allocated to the administrative office for adjustment. In addition, a certain proportion of industrial and commercial tax, etc., was allocated to the administrative office for its use. Land deed tax, public property income, administrative and judicial fines, and violation fines were all assigned to the administrative office as revolving funds to solve certain difficulties in various places.

　　When the conference discussed war support work, it studied past experiences, especially the former Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Liberated Area, which had a good set of experiences in organizing war support. The method was that the military and government jointly formed a logistics command to uniformly control war support, while the specific implementation was carried out by the mobilization departments (mainly composed of the People's Armed Forces Department) set up by logistics organizations at all levels. The advantage is that there are regular war support agencies at all levels, unified command, easy implementation of orders, and easy integration of mobilization, use, and training. After two days of discussion, it was believed that the logistics should have a permanent organization, which is more suitable for today's war requirements, and the specific mobilization and allocation of war support will be uniformly mobilized by the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region in the future. The organizations below the county level may adapt to local conditions and go through their respective institutions. It is recommended that the North China People's Government consider implementation.

　　Finally, the conference discussed the compilation of the 1949 financial revenue and expenditure budget and task allocation. The participating comrades were able to patiently calculate based on the two major principles of ensuring war supply and taking care of the people's burden. How to increase revenue and how to save expenditure, each item and each person and horse were carefully calculated, fearing that there would be any waste, which would let the people down. After two consecutive days and nights, the budget was finally drafted. Finally, the task allocation was calculated and allocated according to the population, land, output, work situation, disaster situation, and enemy situation in each region. Before the closing of the meeting, Comrade Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau spoke to the directors of the administrative offices, in addition to encouraging everyone, he also pointed out: "The task numbers assigned to each region at this financial conference are very large, which is glorious. But the work to complete this task is extremely arduous, and only 'effort' can complete it." He also clearly pointed out to all financial and economic workers: "During the war, we can only do our best not to increase the burden on the people, and we can never 'reduce the burden on the people'. In order to complete and continue to complete this task of supporting the front, we can only respond to Chairman Mao's call, carry out a large-scale production movement, increase industrial and agricultural production by an inch, and implement possible savings in all aspects in order to guarantee supply and support the front."

　　全区财政会议讨论决定
    华北财政加强集中
    奖励勤劳繁荣经济草拟了农工商业税则开源节流保证供给制订下年度财政概算
    【本报特讯】为了响应中国人民领袖毛主席的号召：“生产提高一寸”，以便于更有力地支援革命战争，华北全区的财政会议于九月三日在华北某地举行。出席者有来自各地的各行署主任、财政处（厅）长、华北税务总局长、专县科长等暨财政厅科长以上干部共八十余人。华北银行、华北军区后勤司令部、人民武装部、供给部、华北贸易总公司等，均派有代表参加。会议由前晋冀鲁豫边区政府副主席现华北政府财政部长戎子和及华北政府财政部副部长吴波主持。会议历时十余天，讨论了关于华北财务行政方针、新的农业税则、工商业税、烟酒等税收法令审会计规程、粮库制度及战勤问题等十余种，拟定了一九四九年度财政收支概算草案及各区农业税、工商业税等税收任务分配意见，提交华北人民政府委员会审核。会议采取了大会、小组会及专门研究会、调查会分别进行而又结合的方式，讨论颇为热烈，显示了所有与会人员对人民负责的精神。争论最大的问题是收支概算、农业税任务的分配与财务行政的方针，最后由戎部长作总结性的发言，于十九日圆满闭幕。
    大会首先讨论华北临时人民代表大会所原则上通过的新农业税则一致认为土地改革以前所采用的农业统一累进税，对照顾各阶层负担能力，削弱封建，增加税收，保证供给，起了很大作用，是完全正确的。但在土地改革以后，农民土地大体平均了，如再实行累进，就不完全合理了，就可能妨碍发展生产。新农业税则，规定不累进按比例征税，是合乎现实情况的。又由于土地虽然平分，但多少还有差别，为照顾穷村和收入少的农民，新税则又规定每人扣除一个标准亩的免税点（即十市斗谷），特别是对贫苦无劳动力而生活困难的军工烈属鳏寡孤独，多扣除半个标准亩的免税点，是完全合理的、必要的。同时新税则规定产量订定是按照常年应产量计算，种植特种作物（如棉花、麻、烟叶、蓝靛）均按谷物计算，勤劳加工改进技术增加的产量，一律不增税，懒惰减收的不减税，这就奖励了勤劳发家致富，这是寓奖励于征税的办法。又规定产量报的确实村庄，负担量即应固定起来，这对稳定农民生产情绪提高生产将起极大作用。但新税则的推行，是一件极其细致艰巨的工作，尤其是产量评订，如果不用一定力量去做，就会造成新的更大的不平衡。大会建议华北人民政府迅速颁布评定常年应产量标准亩的规定，并由行署抽调大批有工作经验的有能力的干部，组成农业税评订产量工作团，分赴各区作典型调查以便推广全区。
    大会在讨论工商业税及各种税收法令时，认为工商业税累进征收，最高税率以不超过纯收益的百分之二十五为宜，工业轻于商业，这是合乎保护工商业的原则的。在征收评议上，采取按月或按季征收，按行按业、自报公议，改变过去查帐盘底的办法，使工商业者安心发展营业，这对于繁荣经济是有好处的。但也批判了某些同志强调保护工商业对私人工商业过份迁就，一切均给以优待，甚至不敢或不愿征税。如冀中布置征收工商业税，只按货币征去年的三分之一（以物价计算实际是九分之一），忽视了保障战争供给的一面，也忽视了公营企业领导的一面，片面强调保护工商业的思想是错误的。大会认为为了支援战争，适当平衡农工商业的负担，整理工商业税收及合理的开辟其他税源，是非常必要的。大会建议华北人民政府除修订烟酒工商业税交易税外，另加货物产销税及印花税，并加强税务机构，这样就可比过去税收增加三倍，占岁入六分之一，相对的减轻农民负担。
    大会在第五天讨论到全区财务行政制度，加强集中统一与财政分级制，争论颇为热烈。最后一致认为就发展生产的要求，就目前战争形势要求，在财政困难的情况下加强集中统一，使一切力量用之于战争是必要的。在加强集中统一以后，为了避免下面解决问题不及时及影响地方组织收入的积极性起见，又决定各行署全年预算，经华北人民政府核准后，可一次拨给，并拨给一定预备费归行署掌握调剂。另把工商业税等划出一定比例交行署支配，又将契税公产收入和行政司法罚金违警罚金，全部归行署作机动费用，解决各地某些困难。
    大会讨论到战勤工作时，研究了过去经验，特别原晋察冀解放区，对战勤组织有很好的一套经验，其办法是军政共同组成后勤司令部，统一掌握战勤，而具体执行则由各级后勤组织所设动员部（以人民武装部为主体组成）。其好处各级有经常专管战勤机关，指挥统一，命令易贯彻，动员使用与训练易于结合。经过两天讨论，认为后勤应有经常组织，更能适合今天战争要求，而战勤的具体动员调拨，今后全区均由华北军区后勤部统一调动，而县以下的不妨因地制宜，各通过各自的机构，建议华北人民政府考虑执行。
    大会最后讨论编拟一九四九年度财政收支概算及任务分配，与会同志均能本着保障战争供给照顾人民负担的两大原则，耐心计算，如何开源如何节约，一款一项一人一马均经过详细计算，深恐有所浪费，对不起人民；连续两天两夜，始将概算拟出。最后任务分配，经过计算，依各区人口、土地、产量、工作情况及灾情、敌情分配。闭会前，华北局薄一波同志对与会各行署主任讲话，除对大家勉励外，并指示出：“此次财政会议，给各区分配的任务数字很大，这是光荣的。但完成这一任务的工作则是极艰巨的，只有努‘力’才能完成。”他又明确向所有财经工作者指出：“在战争进行期间，我们只能尽可能地做到不增加人民负担，而绝不能够‘减轻人民负担’。为了完成并继续完成这一支前任务，只有响应毛主席的号召，开展大生产运动，把工农业生产提高一寸，并实行可能的各方面的节约，才能保障供给，支援前线。”
