　　Concrete Leadership in Production is Better Than Too Many Meetings
  　Qiuxia Harvest Inspection in Huguan Sixth District Promotes Autumn Planting
    [Taihang News] In order to further promote harvesting and planting, the Sixth District of Huguan held harvesting and planting inspection meetings in three sub-districts on October 3rd. The summary of this harvesting and planting campaign was obtained after discovering and solving the following problems.
    First, solving the ideological obstacles of village cadres and the masses: In the beginning, many cadres were paralyzed and procrastinating, such as thinking, "What can be done when it rains?" Some said, "The weather is long," and were unwilling to hurry forward; some were waiting for the end of land reform, and as soon as they saw district cadres, they asked, "When will you come to my village to end land reform? Come quickly, it's okay to come today, my village has a lot of livestock, it won't delay the cultivation of land." The masses were most concerned about hoping to end land reform quickly, because they were afraid that if the land was plowed, it would be taken away again after the autumn. For example, they said, "Finish the land reform quickly! It would be better to have a definite conclusion!" Based on these situations, the cadres were first guided to recall that they had not led production well in the past year, and if they did not lead well in the autumn harvest and autumn planting, they would be too sorry for the masses; Lidong (Beginning of Winter) is on the seventh day of the tenth lunar month, and maybe a big wind will freeze the ground. The slogan "Lidong Xiaoxue, the ground is as frozen as iron" was put forward to remind everyone to prevent the ground from freezing and to step up leadership in autumn planting. Combining with the requirement to end land reform quickly, it was explained that only by rushing the work forward and finishing the harvest and planting quickly can the end of land reform be entered. The masses were emphasized that the purpose of ending land reform is to develop production, and the land will not be greatly changed. Even if there is individual adjustment, it must be guaranteed that the tillers are given appropriate wages. Do not be afraid of taking away a small amount of land and delaying the cultivation of your large amount of land; hurry up and cultivate the land well to end the land reform, just waiting is not the way... After these policy publicity and specific mobilization, the ideological obstacles in the autumn harvest and autumn planting were swept away.
    Secondly, solving some specific problems in the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Generally speaking, the autumn harvest is relatively easy to mobilize, because the peasants have worked hard for a year, and a good harvest is their natural requirement. The role of leadership lies in giving play to the organizational strength of the masses, to achieve a quick harvest, to prevent wind and rain damage. Hedong and other villages have done a good job in mobilization, and they are able to work even on rainy days. There are more problems with autumn planting. Especially in villages lacking livestock, the autumn harvest and autumn planting are generally more successful in villages where specific problems are well resolved. The main problems solved are: 1. Clearing mutual aid work accounts. For example, Guo Jia and other villages not only cleared wages, but also distributed the past dividends from agricultural and sideline production. 2. Raising wages. At the beginning of the organization of harvesting and planting, the villages generally reflected that the wages were too low, which affected the enthusiasm for production. Last year, the erroneous simple care for the poor and hired laborers, thinking that the landlords would benefit from high wages, and the poor and hired laborers would suffer losses, so the villages generally lowered wages, and only three catties of rice per day regardless of food. This widespread application has hit production. Households with a lot of labor thought that labor was not worth much, and mutual aid production was not active; households lacking labor thought that hiring someone was nothing, and they became lazy. This inspection decided to raise wages, and everyone was very satisfied except for a few people who did not want to take the opportunity to help each other. The enthusiasm for labor has been greatly improved, and the efficiency of mutual aid production has been strengthened. For example, Fu Gou, a bachelor in Huiche Guo, used to be negative in production because he disliked low wages, and used the excuse that no one cooked, and always went late and returned early; after the wages were raised, he cooked a day's meal at night and went to the field very early. 3. Conscientiously implement equivalence, and neither labor nor livestock should suffer losses. In the past, the wages for livestock were set too low, and households with livestock were dissatisfied. This time, the wages were rationally converted according to the quality of the livestock and manual labor. For example, a good livestock can earn sixteen catties of rice for plowing two mu of good land, and the plowman's wages are calculated separately. After the problem of wage equivalence was solved, people and livestock were free to exchange work, and they voluntarily participated in plowing, and selected people with high skills to catch the plow. The results of land cultivation are very good. Men and women are equally converted into work, and women also actively participate in production. 4. Improve the leadership structure. The harvesting and planting inspection team organized by the whole district played a great role in promoting harvesting and planting. The district paid attention to grasping the situation, discovering and solving problems in a timely manner, and the village harvesting and planting committees strengthened the leadership of the teams, and the cadres took charge separately, going deep into the masses in a concrete way. In Shuzhang Village, because of such a scientific division of labor and concrete leadership in harvesting and planting, although no mass meeting was held, everything was done "Ge Jie" (appropriately). The district totaled, and the autumn harvest was basically completed on the 10th, and the autumn planting can be completed by the end of the month. (Liangyu, Anxi, Yujin, Tusheng)

　　领导生产要具体开会多了没好处
  　壶关六区检查秋收推动秋耕
    【太行讯】壶关六区为了进一步推动收耕，于十月三号分三个小区举行收耕检查会。总结这段收耕运动的开展，是发现与解决了以下问题后获得的。
    首先是解决村干群众的思想障碍：干部方面开始不少麻痹拖拉，如以为天下雨有啥办法？有的说天气长哩，不愿往前赶；有些等待结束土改，一见区干就问：“啥时去我村结束土改？快去吧，今天去也行，俺村牲口多，误不了耕地”。群众中最关心是希望快点结束土改，因怕把地犁了秋后又被抽动。如说“快搞结束土改吧！闹好就死了心啦”。根据这些情况，在干部方面首先引导回忆一年来都没好好领导生产，秋收秋耕中再不好好领导就太对不起群众；今年十月初七就要立冬，说不定一场大风地就冻了。提出“立冬小雪地冻如铁”的口号，提起大家防地冻加紧领导秋耕。并结合快结束土改的要求，说明只有把工作向前赶，快搞完收耕，即可进入结束土改。对群众着重说明结束土改的目的是为了发展生产，土地决不大动，即如有个别调剂，也要保证给耕地者以适当工资，不要怕抽少数地误了自己大块地的耕种；赶快耕好地就能结束土改，光等不是办法……。经过这些政策宣传和具体动员，扫除了秋收秋耕中的思想障碍。
    其次是秋收秋耕中一些具体问题的解决。一般说秋收是比较好发动的，因农民劳苦一年，收好是他本然的要求，领导的作用在于发挥群众的组织力量，做到快收，以防风雨损坏，河东等村动员的好，做到雨天也干。秋耕问题就比较多。特别是牲口缺少村，在具体问题解决好的村，一般秋收秋耕都较有成绩。解决的问题主要有：一、清算互助工帐，如郭家等村不但清算工资，把过去农副结合生产的红利也都分了。二、提高工资。开始组织收种，各村普遍反映工资太低，影响生产不积极。去年错误的单纯照顾贫雇，以为工资高了地主沾光，贫雇吃亏，因此各村普遍降低工资，一天不管饭才三斤米。这样普遍运用，打击了生产，劳力多的户以为劳力不值钱，互助生产不积极；缺劳力的户以为雇个人不算什么，自己也就怠惰起来。这次检查中决定提高工资，除少数投互助之机的人不愿意外，大家都很满意。劳动积极性大大提高，互助生产效率加强。如回车郭付狗是个光棍，以前嫌工资低生产消极，借口没人做饭，老是迟去早回；工资提高后，他黑夜就把一天饭做好，上地很早。三、认真实行等价，劳畜力都不能吃亏。过去牲口工资定的太低，有牲口户不满，这次按好坏牲口与人工合理折合，如好牲口到好地犁二亩为标准可赚十六斤米，捉犁人另外算工。工资等价问题解决后，人畜自由变工，自愿插犋，选技术高的人捉犁。耕地成绩很好。男女等价折工，妇女也积极参加生产。四、健全领导机构。全区组织的收耕检查组，在推动收耕上起了很大作用。区里注意掌握情况，及时发现解决问题，各村收耕委员会加强对小组的领导，干部分头负责，具体深入群众。树掌村在收耕中由于这样科学分工具体领导虽没开过一次群众大会，什么事情也都办的“格节”（合适）。全区总计，十号即大体完成秋收，月底可完成秋耕。（良玉、安喜、玉金、土生）
