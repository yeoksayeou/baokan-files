　　(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th) Chiang Kai-shek flew to Beiping on the 30th of last month, accompanied by his air and naval commanders-in-chief and the deputy commander-in-chief of the Joint Logistics Command, as the People's Liberation Army launched a massive offensive on the Beiping-Liaoning and Beiping-Suiyuan lines. Chiang's actions typically indicate that the situation on his front lines is perilous, and typically prove that it cannot be salvaged, but only exacerbate the danger. (II) Wang Yun-wu, Minister of Finance of the Kuomintang government, flew to Washington on the 23rd of last month to attend the Board of Supervisors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which are controlled by the United States. On the 27th, Wang groveled and begged for loans in a speech at the meeting, and stated that he would have many contacts with all parties in the United States to prepare for loans. At the same time, H.H. Kung, one of the four major families in the United States, also revealed in an interview with the Associated Press on September 28 that the Kuomintang government was seeking help from its American masters, and he requested that the United States provide assistance again at this "critical moment."

　　蒋贼飞赴北平妄图挽救危局
    （一）蒋贼介石于解放军在北宁平绥两线发动巨大攻势之际，上月三十日偕其空、海军总司令，及联勤副总司令飞赴北平。蒋贼的此种行动照例表示其前线的形势危殆，并照例证明不能挽救而只能加重这种危殆。（二）国民党政府财政部长王云五上月二十三日飞抵华盛顿，出席美国控制的世界银行与国际货币基金会监事会。二十七日王在该会演说中，摇尾乞怜，要求借款；并表示他将与美国各方多多接洽，以作贷款准备。同时，现在美国的四大家族之一的孔祥熙，于九月二十八日对合众社记者的谈话，亦透露国民党政府正向其美国主子求救，他要求美国在此“安危关头”再予援助。　　　　　　（新华社陕北五日电）
