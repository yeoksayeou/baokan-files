　　A Militia from a Village in Jinwu
    Tenaciously Persists in Struggle
    Protecting the People's Production
    [Jizhong Electric] The militia from a certain village on the edge of Jinwu, north of the Daqing River, has consistently and tenaciously persisted in the struggle against the enemy since its organization in February of last year. They protected the masses under the enemy's cruel "encirclement and suppression" and "combing out" operations, suffering no losses, and leaving not a single mu of land uncultivated.

    In June of last year, more than thirty Chiang bandits from Wangqingtuo often robbed people on the road east of the village. On one occasion, three villagers were robbed. The militia immediately cooperated with the militias of other villages to drive the bandits away and rescue the robbed masses. After the autumn harvest, the enemy set up a grain-grabbing stronghold in Lilancheng. The militia frequently harassed the enemy. Once, when the enemy went to a neighboring village to rob grain, the village militia concentrated fire on the enemy, knocking down four of them. The enemy abandoned the grain and fled in disarray. Last autumn, due to their active operations, the grain-grabbing enemy never dared to come to the village.

    This spring, Wang Bandit Fenggang led a unit of bandits, cooperating with a unit of the 16th Bandit Army, to carry out "netting" and "suppression" in the area. The village militia still persisted in staying in the village to protect the interests of the masses. On the sixteenth day of the first lunar month, Wang Bandit Fenggang launched a fierce attack on the village, firing machine guns and cannons at the militia. The village militia tenaciously resisted the enemy, who outnumbered them tenfold, killing or wounding five enemy soldiers, and persisting in the battle for a whole day.

    Due to Wang Bandit's frantic "sweeps," the masses dared not sleep at home. When spring plowing began, the masses were still wandering outside. The militia took responsibility for covering the masses' rush to cultivate the land. They first organized themselves to take the lead in production, delivering more than twenty cartloads of manure from their own homes to the fields, and also helped poor military families deliver five cartloads of manure. Under their leadership, the masses who had fled returned one after another for spring plowing. Village cadres and militiamen then organized the entire village for spring plowing, establishing a production committee. The militia provided cover while helping the villagers deliver manure. In less than four days, all the manure was delivered. All 476 mu of land in the village that had not been autumn-plowed were plowed in four and a half days. In addition to standing guard, the militia also took time to cultivate more than 180 mu of land. Besides planting their own, they also helped more than 40 households of villagers with their labor. When the wheat ripened, the enemy set up strongholds in Xin'an and Deshengkou. The militia guarded the masses day and night as they harvested. In addition to harvesting their own wheat, they also helped military families lacking labor to harvest 47 mu. The wheat of two families was only three li away from the enemy stronghold, and enemy sentries often harassed and disrupted them. Under the armed protection of the militia, they harvested 17 mu of wheat and brought it home. Currently, during the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the militiamen are monitoring the enemy day and night. On August 29th, they repelled more than 500 grain-grabbing enemies from Dongjiabao, killing or wounding 16 enemies and protecting the villagers' grain. The militia's crops have been harvested, and wheat has been planted on 66 mu. They are also preparing to help the elderly, widowed, and weak to plant their crops.

    The village militia is not only brave in battle and active in production, but also has good discipline. They never eat public meals. To reduce the burden on the masses, in addition to cultivating their own 371 mu of land this spring, they also reclaimed 32 mu of wasteland, preparing it for winter war expenses.

    The reason why the village militia has achieved these results is mainly due to the good leadership of the militia captain Liu Rui and the political and deputy instructors Wang Zhengkui and Ma Fenglin. They often educate the militia on production, discipline, and work style, and lead by example. When the militia helps each other in production, they first help those who have no labor or whose land is far away. Their work is done after others, so they have high prestige. They persist in holding a squad meeting every seven days and a general meeting every half month, promoting models and criticizing the backward. Xiao Baogen's father said: "Following the militia to learn good qualities, my Baogen has become diligent. He used to be lazy and made people angry, but now I can rest easy." Zhao Dabo and others automatically sent their sons to join the militia, and they have achieved further development. After each battle, the villagers automatically help them repair fortifications. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the villagers consciously comfort them. The village militia has become a model for the Jinwu militia. The Jinwu County Party Committee has specially called on all county militia to learn from them, and the sub-district armed forces department has also issued a commendation order.

　　津武某村民兵
    顽强坚持斗争
    保护群众生产
    【冀中电】大清河北津武边缘某村民兵，自去年二月组织起来后，始终顽强坚持对敌斗争；在敌人“清剿”“剔抉”等残酷情况下保护群众，没受损失，没有荒去一亩土地。
    去年六月，王庆坨的三十多个蒋匪常在某村村东劫道，一次三个老乡被劫。民兵随即配合别村民兵将匪赶跑，救下了被劫群众。秋后，敌人在里澜城按下了抢粮据点，民兵经常袭扰敌人。一次敌人到邻村去抢粮食，该村民兵便集中火力向敌人射击，将敌打倒四个，敌将粮食扔下狼狈逃走。去秋由于他们积极活动，抢粮的敌人始终没敢到该村。
    今春王匪凤岗率土匪一部，配合匪十六军一部，在该地“拉网”“清剿”，该村民兵仍坚持村落，维护群众利益。正月十六日，王匪凤岗向该村猛烈进攻，机枪大炮向民兵射击，该村民兵顽强抗击数十倍的敌人，杀伤敌五名，坚持了一整天的战斗。
    由于王匪的疯狂“扫荡”，群众都不敢在家睡觉，春耕开始，群众仍流浪在外，民兵便负责掩护群众抢耕。并首先组织起来带头生产，将自家的二十多圈粪送到地里，又帮助贫苦军属送了五圈粪。在他们带动下，跑出去的群众纷纷回来春耕，村干、民兵们随即组织全村春耕，成立了生产委员会，民兵一面掩护，一面帮助老乡送粪，不到四天，全部送完。全村没秋耕的四百七十六亩地，四天半全部耕完。民兵除放哨警戒外，还抽空耕地一百八十余亩，除将自己的种上外，还帮助老乡四十多个工。麦子熟了，敌人在信安、得胜口按了据点，民兵昼夜掩护群众收割，除把自家的拔完外，又帮助缺劳动力的军属拔了四十七亩；有两家的麦子距敌据点仅三里地，敌哨兵时常扰乱破坏，在民兵武装掩护下，将十七亩麦子收割到家。目前秋收种麦中，民兵们日夜监视敌人。八月二十九日打退了董家堡五百多抢粮敌人，并杀伤敌人十六名，保护了老乡们的粮食。民兵的庄稼已收割完，麦子种上了六十六亩，他们还准备帮助孤寡老弱种。
    该村民兵不仅打仗勇敢、生产积极，而且纪律良好，从来不吃公饭，为了减轻群众的开支，今春除了种好他们自家的三百七十一亩地外，又开了卅二亩荒地，准备作为冬季战费。
    该村民兵所以获得这些成绩，主要是由于民兵队长刘瑞、正副指导员王正奎、马凤林领导的好，他们经常对民兵进行生产、纪律、作风的教育，并以身作则带动别人。民兵互助生产时，他们先给没人的、地远的去做，他们的活做在别人的后边，所以威信很高。他们坚持了七天一次的班务会，半月一次的全体会，发扬模范批评落后。肖保根的父亲说：“跟着民兵学个好材料，俺保根变的勤谨了，早先懒的人生气，现在可省心了。”赵大伯等自动送自己的儿子参加民兵，他们已获得进一步的发展。每次打仗后，老乡则自动帮助他们修工事；过中秋节老乡们自觉慰劳他们。该村民兵已成为津武民兵的榜样，津武县委特号召全县民兵向他们学习，分区武装部也通令嘉奖。
