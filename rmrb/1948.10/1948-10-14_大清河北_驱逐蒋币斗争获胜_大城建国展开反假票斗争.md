　　[Hebei Central China Electric] Since the beginning of September, our Party, government, army, and people in the area north of the Daqing River have launched an economic offensive to expel Chiang Kai-shek's currency, the "Gold Yuan Notes." In Xiongxian, Baxian, Jinwu, and other counties, the border currency position has become increasingly consolidated and expanded. However, some merchants were still afraid that they would not be able to buy back Chiang Kai-shek's and American goods without Chiang Kai-shek's currency, and suspended business; some were afraid of changes in the situation, etc. In order to remove these concerns and difficulties, state-owned stores purchased coarse grains from the masses on the market north of Daqing River, invested a large amount of local currency, and organized vendors to transport necessities such as vermicelli, white oil, salt, cloth, and towels produced in the liberated areas to Hebei to support the circulation of the local currency. This quickly created a market with the advantage of border currency. For example, Guo, who had a grocery stall in Dongguan, Baxian, exchanged 170,000 border currency and 2,000,000 Chiang Kai-shek's currency (equivalent to 20,000 border currency) on the 11th of September. In the market from Taishan in Baxian to Zhanggang and Kaikou in Xiongxian, state-owned stores invested 100.8718 million border currency and recovered 13.2 million yuan from the sale of goods. As a result, peddlers from Baiyangdian and sugar powder workshops went to Hebei to buy grain and invest border currency. Mats, fish, vegetables, rice, and other products from Baiyangdian naturally flowed north to support the border currency. The supply of coarse grains in Suqiao, Baxian, increased. In late August, it was 1,536 dou, and in early September, it increased to 4,495 dou. Grain and oil prices fell. For example, in Suqiao, corn was 3,415 yuan per catty in late August, but fell to 3,078 yuan in early September, and white oil fell from 2,800 yuan per catty to 2,500 yuan. With the victory in the struggle to expel Chiang Kai-shek's currency, the number of goods produced in the liberated areas on the market increased day by day. For example, at the Jilan City market in Jinwu, some local goods such as towels, socks, and cloth sold more than Chiang Kai-shek's and American goods. One grocery stall had two kinds of towels, local goods and Chiang Kai-shek's and American goods. One dozen of the local goods were sold at the fair, but not a single Chiang Kai-shek and American towel was sold. Most of the masses are willing to buy Gaoyang cloth. Twenty-two villages in Xiongxian 5 have largely eliminated Chiang Kai-shek's currency. The struggle to expel Chiang Kai-shek's currency and Gold Yuan Notes and to combat counterfeit money is continuing in the area.
　　
　　[Another dispatch] Cadres from Dacheng, Jianguo and other counties and districts are actively leading the masses in carrying out the struggle against counterfeit money. In order to help merchants and civilians identify genuine and fake money, Dacheng County convened a county-wide market committee meeting and a town business people's meeting on September 16. The import and export bureau issued a fake bill to everyone for comparison and told everyone the characteristics of the fake bill, such as rough patterns, blurred and unclear, large and light-colored stamps, round and not sharp lace, and unclear and rough fonts. After the meeting, the district cadres in Fanliang Village Market, in cooperation with the Market Committee, set up a special money identification table to help the masses identify money. After the broadcast, the masses bought and sold goods through the money identification table, and 275,000 yuan of fake money was found in half a day. At the Litan Village Market in Jianguo County, teachers and local women cadres organized themselves to broadcast from high places, exposing the enemy's conspiracy and the harm of fake money. They held fake bills and publicized in the cloth market, telling people the signs of genuine and fake bills. The masses and small merchants automatically gathered around them to learn how to identify fake bills. After the publicity, 940,000 yuan of fake money was found in the two markets. People from all over the country have spontaneously reported counterfeit money criminals. The masses in Dacheng found two counterfeit money criminals, Liang Zhenyuan, etc. The masses in Jinwu and Jinghai also found counterfeit money criminals and six small businessmen who were used. More than 6 million yuan of fake money was found. The shameless conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu bandit gangs to harm the people in the liberated areas has aroused the vigilance of the people everywhere.

　　大清河北
    驱逐蒋币斗争获胜
    大城建国展开反假票斗争
    【冀中电】大清河北我党政军民，自九月初展开驱逐蒋币、“金元券”的经济攻势以来，在雄县、霸县、津武等县，边币阵地日益坚固扩大，但有些商人还怕没蒋币买不回蒋美货，买卖停业；有的怕情况变化等。为了解除这些顾虑和困难，公营商店在大清河北市场上收买群众的粗粮，大量投入本币，并组织商贩将解放区出产的粉条、白油、食盐、布匹、毛巾等必需品运到河北，支持本币的流通。这样就很快造成了边币优势的市场。如霸县东关郭某的杂货摊，九月十一日集上兑本币十七万，蒋币二百万（合本币两万）。在霸县台山至雄县张岗、开口一带的市场上，公营商店投下本币十万零八千七百一十八万元。出售物资收回一千三百廿万元。这样一来，白洋淀的小贩和开糖粉坊的纷纷到河北去买粮食，投入本币。白洋淀的席、鱼、蔬菜以及大米等又自然的北流去支持本币。霸县苏桥粗粮上市增多，八月下旬为一千五百三十六斗，九月上旬增到四千四百九十五斗。粮、油价格下落，如苏桥八月下旬玉米每斤边洋三千四百一十五元，到九月上旬则降到玉米三千零七十八元，白油每斤由二千八百元降到两千五百元。随着驱逐蒋币斗争的胜利，市场上解放区出产的货物日益增多。如津武里澜城集上，毛巾、袜子、布匹等土货有的比蒋美货卖的还多。一个杂货摊上有土货与蒋美货的两种毛巾，土货一集卖了一打，蒋美货毛巾一条也没卖出去。大多数群众都愿买高阳布。雄县五已有二十二个村蒋币大部肃清，现该区驱逐蒋币、金元券、反假钞斗争正继续进行中。
    【又电】大城、建国等地县区干部，积极领导群众进行反假钞斗争。大城县为帮助商民识别真假票，于九月十六日召开了全县集委会议和城关商民大会，由出入口局发给每人一张假票，让大家对照，并告诉大家假票的特点，如花纹粗，模糊看不清，戳大色浅，花边圆、不尖，字体不清、粗糙等。会后，樊良村集上，区干部配合集委会专设了认票桌，帮助群众认票，广播后群众买卖东西都经过认票桌，半天查出假票二十七万五千元。建国县里坦村集上，教员和本村妇女干部组织起来，高房广播，揭破敌人的阴谋和假票的害处。拿着假票在布市里宣传，说给人们真假票的记号。群众和小商人们自动围着他们学认假票。经过宣传，两个集上就查出假票九十四万元。各地群众纷纷自动检举假票犯，大城群众查出假票犯梁振远等二人，津武、静海群众，也查出假票犯及被利用的小商人六名。查出假票六百余万元。蒋傅匪帮坑害解放区人民的无耻阴谋，已引起各地群众警惕。
