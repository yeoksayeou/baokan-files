[Central Hebei Electric] Since September, production promotion cooperatives in various counties of Central Hebei have been actively carrying out various businesses in rural areas to vigorously cooperate with the autumn harvest and wheat planting work, and support the production of people in disaster areas. According to the spirit of the Second Production Conference of Central Hebei, production promotion cooperatives in various counties have tightened unnecessary businesses and concentrated their efforts to go deep into rural areas to support mass production. Renqiu Soap Factory retained four people to handle the closing, and transferred five people and 17 million yuan of capital to the timber factory to manufacture agricultural implements. In the past, the capital of the sales department for selling consumer goods accounted for 11 million yuan, but now it has been converted to operate iron and wood factories, making agricultural implements, iron wheel looms, and windlass parts. Lixian also closed its oil mill and textile factory, and transferred a total of 22 million yuan of capital to operate in the transportation and sale of homespun cloth and to support production in disaster areas, and also transferred three cadres from the timber factory to work in the countryside. Anping, Anguo, Renqiu, Jiahe and other county cooperatives have also cancelled unnecessary stores and switched from selling miscellaneous goods to selling necessary goods such as waterwheels, agricultural implements and fertilizers. In other counties such as Gaocheng and Hejian, local cloth is also being packaged and sold in bulk. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, wheat seeds were adjusted, and fertilizers and arsenic were supplied. According to incomplete statistics from 28 counties, a total of 733,662 jin of wheat seeds, 398,500 jin of fertilizer, 1,000 pieces of bean cake, and 10,300 jin of arsenic were prepared. The promotion of "72" wheat was also greatly promoted. In addition to the fact that Dingxian Promotion Cooperative in Central Hebei was designated to purchase 10,000 jin and distribute it to Raoyang, Anping, and Xianxian, Lixian prepared 5,266 jin and Dingxian prepared 20,000 jin. In terms of business, three methods were adopted: cash sales, loans, and exchanges. Among them, the exchange method was quite popular among the masses. For example, the people of Wenxin County exchanged rice for wheat seeds, and the Raoyang Promotion Cooperative, based on the opinions of the masses, stipulated that borrowing wheat seeds would be repaid with gunpowder or pockets. The Dingxian Promotion Cooperative asked the masses to buy or exchange the 100,000 jin of black beans prepared by the public-owned Yuanxing Store for coarse grains, and the households in difficulty would repay them after the autumn harvest, and more than 30,000 jin were quickly exchanged, which solved the difficulty of fertilizer. This year, the masses attached great importance to fertilization, but the price of fertilizer was high (oil cake and black beans exceeded the general grain price). Promotion cooperatives and some stores also played a certain role in adjusting fertilizer, increasing wheat fields, and stabilizing fertilizer prices. For example, Sheng Oil Village in Dingxian exchanged more than 2,000 jin of black beans, one of which was an old and weak household who planned to plant one mu of wheat, and planted more than four mu after exchanging fertilizer. Promotion cooperatives in various places manufactured and supplied a large number of agricultural implements. For example, the Dingxian Promotion Cooperative Iron Factory rushed to produce 1,000 iron shovels, Lixian prepared 200 plowshares, and Wuqiang, Shulu, Jianguo, Jin County and other counties also prepared a lot of plowshares, plow blades, plow bodies, harrow teeth, hoes, rolling car axles, sickle heads, waterwheels, arsenic, arsenic powder and other agricultural implements and insecticides. Jin County and Shulu are preparing to recover the "Huanong No. 4" valley seeds and "August 1st" valley seeds that were loaned out in the spring, and prepare to promote them next year.

    Current shortcomings in work: Business plans are not clear enough; it is still necessary to go deep into the masses and take root
    There are still many shortcomings and problems that need to be solved in the work of promotion cooperatives in various places: (1) At the beginning of the autumn harvest and wheat planting, due to the lack of specific business plans and methods of promotion cooperatives, the cadres of promotion cooperatives were used in the same way as ordinary political and civilian cadres, and were separated from their own business. For example, the Jin County Promotion Cooperative did not plan the business of seeds, fertilizers, arsenic, etc., and asked 14 cadres to go to the countryside to be used uniformly with other cadres. Most of the cadres of the Zhao County Promotion Cooperative went down to do general work. Many farmers wanted to repay their loans, but no one at the branch accepted them; some wanted to borrow but could not borrow. The Hejian Cooperative dispersed the cadres before the production meeting was over, and could not well combine with the central work and other cadres in the county and district. Therefore, in each stage of work in the future, the promotion cooperative must have a specific and clear business plan and a method to combine with the central work, and the county party committee and county government should regularly discuss the work of the promotion cooperative to overcome the current two deviations of leaving the business and going it alone. (2) In the restoration, assistance and development (currently mainly restoration) of village-level small cooperatives and other cooperative organizations, except for Dingxian, which has specific plans, and Lixian and Jiahe, which have requirements, generally not enough attention is paid. In the autumn distribution of floating wealth and the land reform and rectification group, no specific plan was put forward on how to combine, but it only stayed at the investigation stage, and no attention was paid to organizing the strength of the masses to implement cooperation. Due to the lack of grass-roots cooperative foundation, the business operation of the county cooperative relies heavily on stores and peddlers (such as selling arsenic, wheat seeds, and agricultural implements), so the business of the promotion cooperative will not take root among the masses. In the future, the central task of the promotion cooperative should be clarified, that is, to restore and develop production cooperation and mutual assistance in rural areas (cooperatives or mutual assistance groups), gradually establish, drive and rely on cooperative mutual assistance organizations in the village, so that it can better combine with the broad masses of people and exert the power to support production. (3) Due to the lack of ideological leadership and business guidance, the thinking of some promotion cooperative cadres is very chaotic, and some have the phenomenon of being disorganized and undisciplined. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting in Hejian County, the Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative allocated 1,900 jin of arsenic. They proposed "operating through peddlers" and sold 800 jin of arsenic to the Jinnan Store. The purchase price was 5,000 yuan per jin, and the selling price was 8,400 yuan, making a profit of 3,400 yuan per jin. Qingcangjiao, Jianguo and other counties lacked arsenic and could not buy it, and Hejian could not use it and did not return it. This purely profit-seeking view that ignores the needs of the masses is very wrong. Although it has been corrected, it is still very important to strengthen ideological leadership and business guidance in the future. Therefore, the meeting, reporting, learning, leave, expenditure, accounting, reporting, material insurance and other systems that have been established in various counties should be adhered to and realized. The county party committee and the government should still strengthen the leadership of the promotion cooperative.

### 冀中各县生产推进社　紧缩消费业务大力扶植生产

　　冀中各县生产推进社
  　紧缩消费业务大力扶植生产
    【冀中电】九月份以来，冀中各县生产推进社，深入农村积极开展各种业务，以大力配合秋收种麦工作，扶植灾区群众生产。各县生产推进社根据冀中第二次生产会议转业的精神，紧缩了不必要的业务，集中力量深入农村扶植群众生产。任邱肥皂厂留四人办理结束，抽出五人及一千七百万元资本转向木厂制造农具。门市部过去卖消费品的资本占一千一百万，现已转营铁木工厂，制作农具及铁轮织布机和风弓零件。蠡县也结束了油坊、纺织厂，共抽出资本二千二百万元转营土布运销及扶助灾区生产，并从木厂抽出三个干部下乡工作。安平、安国、任邱、交河等县社也都取消了不必要的门市，由卖零星杂货转成卖水车、农具、肥料等必需品。其他藁城、河间等县土布亦进行整装打销路。在秋收种麦中，调剂了麦种，供给了肥料信石。据二十八县不完整统计，共准备麦种七十三万三千六百六十二斤、肥料三十九万八千五百斤、豆饼一千块、信石一万零三百斤。并大量推广了“七二”小麦，除冀中指定定县推进社代买一万斤分配到饶阳、安平、献县三处外，蠡县准备五千二百六十六斤，定县准备二万斤。在营业上，采取了现款卖、贷放和交换三种方式，其中以交换方式颇受群众欢迎。如文新县群众拿稻子换麦种，饶阳推进社根据群众意见规定了借麦种还火硝或口袋。定县推进社将公营元兴商店准备的十万斤黑豆，叫群众买或以粗粮换，困难户秋收后再还，很快换出了三万余斤，解决了肥料的困难。今年群众对施肥很重视，但肥料价格高昂（油饼黑豆超过一般粮价），推进社及某些商店在调剂肥料、增加麦田、稳定肥料价格上也起了一定的作用。如定县绳油村换出黑豆二千余斤，其中一户孤寡计划种麦一亩，换肥料后种了四亩多。各地推进社制造与供给了大批农具。如定县推进社铁厂赶造铁铲一千张，蠡县准备犁铧二百个，武强、束鹿、建国、晋县等县也准备了不少犁铧、犁铲、犁身、耙齿、镐、轧车轴、镰头、水车、信石、信粉等农具和杀虫药品。晋县、束鹿准备将春季贷出的“华农四号”谷种和“八一”谷种收回，准备明年推广。
    目前工作中的缺点：业务计划不够明确　尚需深入群众扎根
    目前各地推进社工作中仍有不少缺点，及需要解决的问题：（一）在秋收种麦一开始，由于推进社缺乏具体的业务计划及办法，因此推进社干部与一般政民干部同样使用，与本身业务脱节。如晋县推进社在种籽、肥料、信石等业务还未计划好，就叫十四个干部下乡与其他干部统一使用。赵县推进社干部大部分下去作一般工作，不少农民想归还贷款，送到分社没人收；有的想贷也贷不上。而河间社则在生产会议还未开完时即将干部分散下去，不能很好的和中心工作及县区其他干部结合。因此今后在每一工作阶段中，推进社必须有具体明确的业务计划及与中心工作结合的办法，县委、县政府要定期讨论推进社工作，以克服目前离开业务和孤立去搞的两种偏向。（二）在恢复、扶助与发展（目前主要是恢复）村社小型社等合作组织上，除定县有具体计划，蠡县、交河等县有要求外，一般都注意不够。在秋季分浮财结束土改整组中，没有提出如何结合的具体计划，而只停留在调查阶段，没有注意组织群众的力量实行合作。由于缺乏下层合作基础，所以县社的业务经营很多是依靠门市和小贩（如卖信石、麦种、农具），这样推进社业务就不会在群众中扎根。今后应明确推进社工作的中心任务，便是恢复与发展农村中的生产合作互助（合作社或互助小组），逐渐建立与带动并依靠村中的合作互助组织，这样才能更好与广大群众相结合，发挥扶助生产的力量。（三）由于缺乏思想领导与业务指导，有的推进社干部思想很混乱，有的存在着无组织无纪律现象。河间县社在秋收种麦中，由水利推进社拨给信石一千九百斤，他们提出“通过小贩经营”，并将信石卖给冀南商店八百斤，买时每斤合价五千元，卖时合八千四百元，每斤赚洋三千四百元。而青沧交、建国等县缺信石买不到，河间用不了也不退回。这样忽视群众需要的单纯营利观点，是非常不对的。虽然已纠正了，但今后加强思想领导与业务指导仍很重要。因此各县开始建立的会议、汇报、学习、请假、开支、会计、表报、物资保结等制度，应坚持实现。县委及政府仍应加强对推进社的领导。
