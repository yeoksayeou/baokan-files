Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 10th: The Western Henan Administrative Office of the Central Plains Liberated Area, in order to strictly prevent the Kuomintang reactionary government's conspiracy to use counterfeit legal tender and counterfeit gold yuan to obtain important materials and gold and silver from our area, and disrupt our region's finances, issued a public notice on September 1st, prohibiting the inflow of counterfeit gold yuan and the export of gold and silver, and decided to completely expel counterfeit legal tender in exchange for materials. On September 12th, the office also issued a notice prohibiting the circulation of silver dollars in the market. Even before the administrative office issued the public notice, eliminating counterfeit legal tender had already become a mass movement in western Henan. Luoyang City registered 9.2549 billion yuan of counterfeit legal tender in a single day on August 9th, and expelled 8 billion yuan of counterfeit legal tender in three days from the 11th to the 13th. Merchants in Baofeng City had already requested the democratic government to ban counterfeit legal tender and counterfeit gold yuan, and prohibit the circulation of silver dollars, allowing only Central China currency to circulate, as early as late August, which was adopted by the government. Currently, Central China currency is deeply supported by the masses in western Henan, and its credibility is even higher than before. The silver dollars cashed out by the Lushan branch of the Central China Bank amounted to 27,766 yuan in eleven days in late August, but in the ten days of early September after the administrative office issued a ban on the inflow of counterfeit gold yuan and the outflow of silver dollars, it dropped to 1,982 yuan. Merchants and residents in Xin'an, Yanshi, Mengjin and other places are taking silver dollars to exchange for Central China currency, saying: "Central China currency is safe, with sufficient silver dollars as backing." Currently, the currency value in all towns and cities in western Henan is stable, and prices are stable. Taking Luoyang as an example: in the half month from September 1st to 16th, the city consistently maintained the price of wheat at 110 to 120 yuan of Central China currency per *shi dou*, green beans at 150 to 160 yuan per *shi dou*, cotton at 50 to 60 yuan per *jin*, and salt at 12 to 13 yuan per *jin*.

In addition, the Yuwan Su Administrative Office of the Central Plains Liberated Area also issued a public notice last month prohibiting the export of silver dollars. If discovered, a warning will be given first, and the silver dollars will be temporarily recovered at the statutory price; those who repeatedly fail to reform after repeated warnings may be detained and confiscated by the government according to the severity of their circumstances.

　　豫西禁绝伪币流通
    我中州票深得拥护
    【新华社中原十日电】中原解放区豫西行署，为严密防止国民党反动派政府阴谋以伪法币、伪金圆券套取我区重要物资及黄金白银，扰乱我区金融，特于九月一日颁发布告，禁止伪金圆券流入及黄金白银出口，并决定全部逐出伪法币，换回物资。九月十二日，该署又布告禁止银元流通市面。早在行署颁发布告之前，排除伪法币即已在豫西形成为群众性的运动。洛阳市于八月九日一天内，即登记伪法币九十二亿五千四百九十万元，十一日至十三日三天内，即逐出伪法币八十亿元。宝丰城内商人，则早在八月下旬即要求民主政府禁绝伪法币、伪金圆券及禁止银元流通，只准中州票流通，当为政府所采纳。目前中州票深得豫西群众拥护，信用较前更高。中州银行鲁山支行所兑出之银元，八月下旬十一天中为二万七千七百六十六元，而在行署颁布禁止偏金圆券流入与银元出境后的九月初旬十天中，则降为一千九百八十二元。新安、偃师、孟津等地商民，均拿着银元找换中州票，并说：“中州票保险，有充足的银洋做准备。”现豫西全区各城镇币值巩固，物价平稳。以洛阳为例：该市九月一日至十六日的半月内，始终保持小麦每市斗中州票一百十元至一百二十元，绿豆每市斗一百五十至一百六十元，棉花每市斤五十至六十元，盐每市斤十二至十三元。
    又：中原解放区豫垸苏行署亦于上月布告禁止银元出口，如经查获，先予警告，银元暂按法定价格收回；屡诫不改者，得由政府按其情节轻重，予以扣押及没收。
