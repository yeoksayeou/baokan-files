Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Reuters, Tokyo dispatch: The newly formed All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions Liaison Committee (a general organization linking trade unions nationwide) opened its two-day meeting here on the 18th. A total of 571 representatives attended, representing the committee's 78 member unions and 7 non-member unions. The leaders of two powerful leftist trade unions—Kaido, Chairman of the National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, and Tokyobashi Ichikichi, Chairman of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union—have been elected by the conference as chairmen of the committee. The meeting has two topics: the government's proposed amendment to the National Public Service Employees Act (already scheduled to be submitted to Parliament for discussion) and the policy of establishing a minimum wage system.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: According to various reports, electrical union workers across Japan are launching a series of strikes to fight against the authorities' brutality in arresting strike activists. In Hokkaido, workers at the Kitami Electric Power Company in the northeast held a five-minute power outage strike on the 9th, followed by the arrest of 23 strike activists. The All-Japan Electrical Workers' Union protested this, stating that it would boycott the arbitration committee meetings under the Central Labor Relations Commission and instructing all branches of the All-Japan to "fight against the suppression in the Kitami district" (Reuters). On the 13th, workers at the Kitami Electric Power Company held another 30-minute protest strike. On the 14th, electrical workers in Kushiro in the southeast went on strike. In Kyushu, electrical workers in Omuta in the west held a 20-minute strike on the 11th. Electrical workers in Fukuoka in the northwest held a two-hour strike on the 15th; to protest the arrest of 47 people, including union officials, they went on strike again for four hours on the 16th, and another two hours in the evening. On Honshu, electrical workers in Shizuoka in central Japan held a one-hour strike on the 11th, and eight people were arrested. The power outage strikes protesting the arrests have brought the entire Japanese electrical system to the verge of paralysis. The Labor Section Chief of MacArthur Headquarters is consulting with the Labor Relations Commission to discuss countermeasures.
