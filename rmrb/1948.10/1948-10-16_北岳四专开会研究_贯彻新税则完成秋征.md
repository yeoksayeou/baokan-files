　　Beiyue Fourth Special District Holds Meeting to Study
  　Implement the New Tax Regulations and Complete the Autumn Grain Collection
    [Beiyue News] In order to correctly implement the new agricultural tax regulations and complete the collection task, the Beiyue Fourth Special District held a collection meeting at the end of last month. More than 20 people attended, including county heads, heads of finance sections, and cadres from the Industrial and Commercial Bank. The meeting first focused on reviewing last year's collection work, pointing out that last year's collection had certain achievements, but from the perspective of the entire special district, there was still a backlog of 30,900 dan (equivalent to 11% of the task). Although there were objective reasons, the main reasons were the neglect of the district party committee and special commissioner's office and leadership at all levels, unfair and unreasonable distribution, excessive burden on middle peasants, and especially the benevolent views of some comrades, which led to the task not being well completed. Deputy Special Commissioner Qi Weili, in his report, made a self-criticism, saying: Because we failed to strictly implement the instructions of higher authorities and neglected the seasonality, the collection of cloth was handled poorly. The original arrangement of 120,000 bolts was intended to be completed by organizing the masses to spin and weave during the slack season before the autumn harvest, which would benefit both the public and private sectors. However, most counties did not conduct specific investigations and research, and just shouted "overburdened," and some county districts did not even assign tasks to the masses, delaying it until the winter clothing season, when they rushed to complete it. At this time, it was the busy autumn season, with a day's short-term labor costing 3,000 yuan, while the price of cloth rose and the price of rice fell, and some people were forced to buy cloth at high prices to pay the tax. He called on all cadres present to overcome benevolent views, strengthen discipline, seize the season, resolutely complete the cloth collection task, resolutely clear the backlog, and accept last year's lessons. The meeting decided that after the autumn harvest and wheat planting this year, from October 20th to November 10th, the Party, government, and people should take collection as the central task, and vigorously rush to complete it (autumn plowing work cannot be stopped), and then switch to comprehensively rectifying the Party after the end of land reform. Before the collection is assigned to the village, each work team should focus on rectifying the Party, adjusting the organization, and initially solving the problem of unity between new and old cadres to create favorable conditions for collection. Continue to test and strengthen village-level organizations during the collection process. Due to the short collection time, attention should be paid to notifying the masses in advance to prepare as soon as possible to minimize the difficulties for the masses in paying. After each county returns, without waiting for the distribution to the village, they should immediately start publicizing the new tax regulations, notify the masses to prepare funds for repairing large mills, scales, and inspect granaries and warehouses.

    In view of the deviations and errors in last year's collection distribution and the changes in the rural economy after land reform, according to the resolutions of the North China Financial Conference, the Fourth Special District will resolutely implement the basic spirit of the new agricultural tax regulations this year, abolish the progressive rate, and collect taxes in proportion to the normal annual output, without any difference based on class. Other provisions in the new tax regulations, such as: lowering the tax exemption point, expanding the scope of burden, exemption of livestock from consumption tax, timber forest exemption, and three-year tax exemption for terraced fields, all play a certain role in guaranteeing supply and rewarding production, and should be widely publicized through blackboards and markets, and try to teach everyone to calculate (standard mu minus the tax exemption point and livestock consumption is the burden mu). After recalculation, each village should post a list for the masses to review. Of course, due to the excessive urgency of time this year, some details of the new tax regulations will be postponed or flexibly implemented (such as: livestock registration is based on the time of investigation, mountain goods and fruits will not be discounted by 60%, etc.) to avoid individual problems from hindering the completion of the entire task. In order to ensure fair distribution, the Special Commissioner's Office carefully calculated the allocation figures for each county day and night. It was found that the figures for Huolu, Jingxing, and Tang were relatively truthful, while the output set for Zhengding was low, with the number of mu reduced by 76,000 mu. Pingshan and Fuping relaxed their leadership and did not complete the agricultural tax survey, simply submitting the materials from the two districts as they were, which was criticized at the meeting. Regarding the issue of county-to-village allocation, due to the chaotic figures this year, the large number of new cadres, and the short time, it was decided that the county would directly allocate to the village (the county would convene an expanded cadre meeting in the district to help the district allocate to the village, and this meeting could also absorb some peasant representatives and old cadres who understand the situation). In the allocation, we must advocate careful calculation, seek truth from facts, carefully review the authenticity of various figures, and expose the phenomenon of falsely reporting one's own unit.
    Regarding the collection work, cadres from stores and banks specially discussed it. In order not to fluctuate the market, ensure that the masses pay their taxes without suffering losses, it was decided that: (1) The completion time will be extended by half a month (until November 25th). (2) Each county should carefully analyze the currency circulation of each village, as well as the distance from the market and other conditions. (3) Each state-owned store should prepare funds and grain to stabilize prices. (4) The bank should prepare as much funds as possible and lend them to stores to purchase grain when necessary.

　　北岳四专开会研究
  　贯彻新税则完成秋征
    【北岳讯】为正确执行农业税新税则，完成征收任务，北岳四专区于上月末开征收会议。到会有各县县长、财政科长、工商银行干部共二十余人。会上首先着重检讨了去年的征收工作，指出去年征收有其一定成绩，但从全专区说，至今还留下三万零九百大石（即任务百分之十一）的尾欠。虽有客观原因，但主要由于地委专署及各级领导上的忽视，分配中的不公平不合理、过分加重中农，特别是某些同志的恩赐观点，致任务未很好完成。齐副专员维礼在其报告中自我检讨说：由于我们不能严格执行上级指示，忽视了季节性，关于布的征收，把一桩好事办坏了。原布置十二万匹，是打算在秋前挂锄期间组织群众纺织完成，这样公私两利。但大部县份没具体调查研究情况，就空喊“过重”，有的县区根本不向群众布置，拖到冬装用布时，才又仓促突击。此时已届秋忙，一天短工三千元，而布涨米落，个别群众被迫以高价买布缴布。他号召到会所有干部，克服恩赐观点，加强纪律性，抓紧季节坚决完成征布任务，并坚决清理尾欠，接受去年教训。会议决定今年秋收种麦后，十月廿日起至十一月十日前，党政民以征收为中心任务，大力突击完成（秋耕工作不能停止），转入结束土改全面整党。在征收未布置到村前，各工作组应抓紧重点整党，调整组织，初步解决新老干部团结问题，为征收造成有利条件。在征收中继续考验与加强村级组织。由于征收时间的短促，要注意事先通知群众及早准备，尽量减少群众交纳时的困难，各县回去后，不等分配到村，马上开始宣传新税则，通知群众准备款子修理大碾、对秤、检查粮库、库房等工作。
    鉴于去年征收分配中的偏差和错误及土改后农村经济情况的变化，根据华北财政会议决议，四专今年要坚决贯彻农业税新税则的基本精神，取消累进率，按常年应产量比例征收，不得因阶级不同而有轻重之差。他如新税则中规定的：降低免税点，扩大负担面，牲口除消耗、木材林免征、梯田免税三年等规定，亦均对保证供给奖励生产有其一定作用，应利用黑板报、集市，广泛宣传，并尽量教大家会算（标准亩减去免税点和牲口消耗就是负担亩），各村改算后应列榜公布，请群众审核。当然由于今年时间过于迫促，新税则中某些细节暂缓或变通执行（如：人畜登记以调查时为准，山货果木暂不六折等），以免因个别问题牵制了整个任务的完成。为了分配的公平，专署对各县分配数字曾夜以继日地仔细计算，其中发现获鹿、井陉、行唐的数字较为真实，而正定订产量较低，亩数减少达七万六千亩。平山、阜平放松领导，没有完成农业税的调查，只把两个区材料原样端上来，会议已予批评。关于县往村分配的问题，由于今年数字乱，新干部多，时间短，决定县直接分配到村（县召集区扩干会，在会上帮助区分配到村，此会议中并可吸收某些农民代表及了解情况的老干部参加），分配中要提倡精打细算，实事求是，仔细审查各种数字的真实程度，揭发虚报本位现象。
    关于征款工作，由商店银行干部专门加以讨论，为了不致波动市场，保证群众交款、不吃亏，决定：（一）完成时间延长半个月（到十一月二十五日）。（二）各县对村分配要仔细分析各村货币流通量，及距市场远近等条件。（三）各公营商店准备款和粮平稳物价。（四）银行尽量准备一部款子，于必要时贷给商店收购粮食。（李成瑞）
