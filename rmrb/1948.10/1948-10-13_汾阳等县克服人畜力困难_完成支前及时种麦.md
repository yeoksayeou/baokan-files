[Jinzhong Dispatch] The masses in the newly liberated areas of Fenyang and other counties, who suffered from the Yan bandit's brutal "military-agricultural integration" policy and were extremely short of manpower and animal power, properly resolved the contradiction of using manpower and animal power while completing the arduous task of supporting the front, and rushed to sow wheat. Dongyaozhuang Village in the Fifth District of Fenyang had only twelve animals. If it were to transport fifty door panels for the task of supporting the front, the village's 441 mu of wheat would not be fully sown. Therefore, they organized manpower to carry them on their backs, saving animal power for sowing wheat. But it was still not enough to finish sowing, so they organized people to pull the seed drill and hoe the ground. As a result, they not only completed supporting the front and planted all the wheat fields from last year on schedule, but also reclaimed wasteland and replanted, increasing the sown area by 65 mu. In Xicheng Village, Wenshui, three people pulled the seed drill and sowed in a mutual aid group, sowing ten mu in one day. This kind of human pulling is extremely common in Jinzhong. Wenjiazhuang Village in Pingyao organized eighty-one women to grind flour, grinding more than 5,000 jin of wheat in ten days, saving animal power for night transportation and rushing to sow during the day. More than 1,900 mu of wheat land in the whole village was sown half a month earlier than last year. Tangxingzhuang and Chengguan in the Fifth District of Fenyang organized bicycles, carts, and rubber-wheeled carts to transport materials, saving animal power for sowing wheat. The Third District of Fenyang used the method of equivalent exchange to organize Bian Temple Mountain to sow wheat, and organized the livestock of the masses who did not sow wheat to help the plains which lacked manpower and animals to rush to sow. The plains then transported materials to the Bian Mountain masses who lacked large carts. Zhangjiazhuang also voluntarily sent ten yokes of oxen to Yangcheng Village to rush to sow. On September 23rd, Fenyang inspected the Third District, and the ten administrative villages sowed 21,628 mu of wheat last year. As of around September 23rd, 19,839 mu had been sown, and only 1,789 mu had not been sown. Most of the unsown land belonged to poor peasants and hired laborers who lacked livestock and seeds, and landlords and rich peasants who were afraid of sowing but not getting the land. Therefore, it was decided that in addition to the original 116,940 dou of wheat seeds being distributed quickly, an additional 11,000 jin would be lent. In order to dispel their worries, a notice was issued, clearly stipulating that "whoever sows this year, harvests next year," which had a great effect. In Yangcheng Village, the Third District of Fenyang, the masses had fled in the past, and more than 1,200 mu of wheat land was deserted. The masses were afraid that after sowing, the original landlords would return and take it away. Some landlords and rich peasants were afraid of land reform and did not sow, but after listening to the cadres explaining the government's notice, they began to rush to sow. The government also lent 882 jin of wheat seeds to 49 households lacking wheat seeds. By September 26th, more than 940 mu had been reclaimed and were being rushed to sow. In Luocheng and other three villages in the Fourth District of Fenyang, more than 13,000 mu were flooded in previous years. This year, the drought has subsided, and the masses are also actively rushing to sow wheat fields due to the government's reward of exempting public grain for one year for reclaiming wasteland.

### 汾阳等县克服人畜力困难  完成支前及时种麦

　　汾阳等县克服人畜力困难
    完成支前及时种麦
    【晋中电】经过阎匪“兵农合一”暴政摧残，人畜力极端缺少的汾阳等县新解放区群众，在完成繁重的支前任务中，适当解决人畜力使用的矛盾，抢种宿麦。汾阳五区东窑庄全村只有十二头牲口，如要运输五十块门板的支前任务，全村四四一亩麦将不能完全播种。便组织人力背送，省下畜力种麦。但仍不能种完，又组织人拉耧种，用镢刨，结果不但完成支前，将去年麦地全部按期播种，而且开荒回茬，又增种六五亩。文水西城村三人拉耧，变工播种，一天便种十亩。这种人拉在晋中极为普遍。平遥文家庄组织起八十一个妇女推面，十几天内磨麦子五千余斤，节省下畜力，黑夜运输，白天抢种。全村一千九百多亩麦地，比去年提前半月完成播种。汾阳五区唐兴庄及城关组织脚踏车、推车、胶皮车运送器材，节省下畜力用于种麦。汾阳三区用等价交换办法，组织边寺山种宿麦，组织不种宿麦的群众的牲畜帮助平川缺人畜的抢种。平川则给缺少大车的边山群众运输器材。张家庄亦自动出十犋牲口去阳城村抢种。汾阳九月廿三日检查，三区十个行政村去年种麦二一六二八亩。截至九月二十三左右，已种一九八三九亩，未种的仅一七八九亩。未种的大部为缺乏牲畜籽种的贫雇农，及怕种上得不上的地主富农。由此决定，除原贷十一万六千九百四十斗麦籽迅速发放外，并重新补贷一万一千斤。为解除其顾虑，并出布告，明确规定“今年谁种，明年谁收”，作用极大。汾阳三区杨城村过去群众逃亡，麦地荒了一千二百余亩，群众怕种上后，原地主返回夺去，部分地主富农怕土改，都不种，听了干部讲解政府布告，开始进行抢种。政府又贷给四十九家缺麦籽户八百八十二斤麦籽，至九月二十六日，已开出九百四十余亩，正抢种中。汾阳四区罗城等三村，往年水淹一万三千余亩，今年天旱水退，群众亦因政府开生荒免征公粮一年之奖励，积极抢种麦田。
