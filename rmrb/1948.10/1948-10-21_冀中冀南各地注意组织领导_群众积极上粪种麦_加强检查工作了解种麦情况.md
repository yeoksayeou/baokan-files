　　Hebei Central and Southern Hebei Pay Attention to Organizing Leadership
　　The Masses Actively Apply Manure and Sow Wheat
　　Strengthen Inspection Work to Understand the Wheat Sowing Situation
    [Our Newspaper's News] Cadres in Hebei Central and Southern Hebei entered the villages in September to guide the masses in sowing wheat. Great achievements have been made in the past month. Due to the cadres' active promotion of the Party's production policies in the villages, dispelling the masses' ideological concerns, the masses' enthusiasm for production has gradually increased since the autumn harvest and wheat sowing. In areas of southern Hebei where land reform has not been completed, understanding that whoever sows wheat this year will reap the harvest, the masses' enthusiasm for production has completely stabilized, and they are willing to sow wheat early and sow more wheat. In Fancun Village, Zhao County, Hebei Central, 28 middle-peasant households bought a total of 900 jin of manure and 8,630 jin of soybean cake for this year's wheat sowing, with each middle peasant buying an average of 340 jin of fertilizer, which is unprecedented for these 28 middle-peasant households in the past ten years. In Mazhao Village, Ninth District, Zhao County, some middle peasants sold small cattle to buy large cattle to cultivate the land and sow wheat. Some middle peasants in Shen County said, "It's time for us to exert ourselves!" They start work early and stay late, and carry manure baskets as soon as they go out. At present, wheat sowing in various parts of Hebei Central has been largely completed. In general areas, the wheat sowing area exceeds 30% of the total cultivated land area. According to statistics from four villages in Wuqiang, the total cultivated land is 15,279.19 mu, and the wheat sowing area is 5,917.26 mu, accounting for 38%. Statistics from Anping County, lacking one district, show that the total cultivated land is 477,320 mu. Last year's wheat sowing area was 108,924 mu, accounting for 22.8%. This year's wheat sowing area is 188,845 mu, accounting for 39%. In slightly arid areas, such as Xianxian, Jianguo, and Jiaohe, statistics from twenty villages in Jiaohe show that a total of 8,659 mu of wheat were sown, accounting for 24% of the total cultivated land area. In areas affected by floods, the wheat sowing area this year generally reaches about 70% to 80%. For example, in Manzheng Village, Anping, the wheat sowing area is 2,230.8 mu, accounting for more than 80% of the cultivated land. This year, the wheat sowing area in various parts of southern Hebei has also increased compared to last year. For example, in Dongshigu Village, Yuanchao, after the masses discussed the benefits of sowing more wheat, they sowed 50% of the village's cultivated land, an increase of 20% compared to last year. The original plan for Beilizhuang, Second District of the county, was to sow wheat on 40% of the cultivated land, but it has now exceeded the plan, sowing 42.5%. The original plan was to apply two carts of manure per mu of wheat land, but now two and a half carts are being applied. All the wheat land reserved in the entire southern Hebei region has been sown, and the land is currently being cultivated.
    During the rush to sow wheat and harvest the autumn crops, the masses universally and spontaneously allocated labor and helped each other to overcome the difficulties of manpower and animal power. A survey of 59 villages in seven districts of Jin County showed that out of 888 mutual aid groups, 380 were existing mutual aid organizations of the masses. In Daqudi, Lixian County, and Nanxinzhuang, Boye, natural mutual aid organizations of the masses account for about 25% to 30% of the total number of households in the village. In Wenren Village, Qingyuan, due to the lack of livestock, the masses organized 39 mutual aid groups with a total of 159 households on the basis of joint plowing, most of which are small-scale mutual aid. However, because the masses have various specific needs, the forms of mutual aid groups are also diverse, including: livestock sharing, human power exchanging animal power, human power mutual aid in pulling plows, female labor exchanging male labor, light work exchanging heavy work, brothers dividing the family but working together due to lack of labor, and friends helping each other. Among them, there are many temporary labor exchanges, but there are also longer-term cooperation that has persisted for many years. These natural mutual aid organizations of the masses are all voluntary combinations. Although there are no clear systems such as work point calculation, there is a natural principle of equivalence among the masses. Currently, Hebei Central is studying this preliminary form of natural labor mutual aid to gradually improve it and achieve organized leadership.
    Mobilizing the masses to organize production mutual aid, Hebei Central has gained the following four points of experience in the autumn harvest and wheat sowing: (1) Conduct propaganda and deliberation, hold fewer large meetings during the day, hold more small meetings at night, and hold them in natural settings, without being constrained by formalities, speaking and discussing at the same time, with more and more people participating, but there must be investigation and preparation beforehand. (2) Educate the masses with the creations of the masses, district cadres go deep into the natural mutual aid groups of the masses to lead, specifically help solve difficulties, improve the original mutual aid of the masses, encourage and commend them, and broadcast them to promote others. (3) Rely on activists, but do not limit them to Party members and cadres, but also discover real activists in production among the masses, experts in farming, and mobilize them to lead others. (4) The vast majority of natural mutual aid organizations of the masses have gradually developed mutual aid and cooperation due to joint livestock raising and compatible personalities. After land reform, many masses jointly raise livestock. Labor mutual aid organizations should be developed on this basis.
    The organization and leadership of this year's wheat sowing have been greatly improved in both Hebei Central and Southern Hebei. In addition to using the Party newspaper to publish editorials and strengthen wheat sowing reports to guide wheat sowing, the Southern Hebei District Party Committee has also established a work inspection system, convening investigation meetings with district and village cadres to understand the actual situation in wheat sowing, what difficulties there are, how to overcome them, and whether the decisions made above are suitable for the actual situation below. After research, propose solutions, and then use methods such as telephone calls, letters, and instructions to issue them and solve problems in a timely manner. The Southern Hebei District Party Committee has instructed local party committees and county party committees to universally adopt this work inspection system.
    Under the guideline of sowing as much wheat as possible this year, both Hebei Central and Southern Hebei have seen a tendency to simply pursue numerical targets. Some counties decide how much wheat to sow without considering the masses' manpower, animal power, fertilizer accumulation, and soil moisture conditions, and the leaders subjectively put forward numerical requirements. Some counties even arrange them to the villages level by level, resulting in district and village cadres issuing compulsory orders. In particular, the lack of fertilizer means that sowing more wheat will not only fail to increase yields but will reduce them. There is a shortage of firewood and grass in the plains, and very little firewood fertilizer and grass fertilizer are produced. Most of the masses are unable to buy fertilizer. At present, land yields are lower than before the war, and the lack of fertilizer is the main reason. Both the Hebei Central and Southern Hebei District Party Committees have paid attention to correcting this tendency. In order to do a good job in next year's large-scale production, the Southern Hebei District Party Committee has also proposed that leading the masses to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer and winter plowing are the main tasks for leading the masses to carry out production after the completion of the wheat sowing work.

　　冀中冀南各地注意组织领导
  　群众积极上粪种麦
  　加强检查工作了解种麦情况
    【本报讯】冀中、冀南两地干部，于九月进入乡村，指导群众种麦，一月来已获得很大成绩。由于干部到村积极宣传党的生产政策，打破群众思想顾虑，秋收种麦以来，群众生产情绪逐渐提高。冀南未完成土改地区，因了解今年种麦，谁种谁收，群众生产情绪完全趋稳定，都愿意早种麦，多种麦。冀中赵县范村有廿八户中农，今年种麦共买了九百斤大粪，八千六百卅斤豆饼，每个中农平均买肥三百四十斤，为该廿八户中农十年来所未有。该县九区马赵村，有些中农卖了小牛买大牛，耩地种麦。深县有些中农说：“该咱们上劲了！”干活起早恋晚，出门就背起粪筐。现冀中各地种麦已大体完成，在一般地区中，种麦面积均超过总耕地面积百分之卅以上，武强四个村统计，耕地共一五二七九·一九亩，种麦五九一七·二六亩，占百分之卅八，安平全县缺一个区的统计，总耕地四七七三二○亩，去年种麦一○八九二四亩，占百分之廿二点八，今年种麦一八八八四五亩，占百分之三十九。稍旱地区种麦面积，如献县、建国、交河一带，以交河二十个村统计，共种麦八六五九亩，占总耕地面积百分之二十四。水灾地区，今年种麦面积一般均达百分之七十至八十左右，如安平满正村，种麦二二三○·八亩，占耕地百分之八十以上。冀南各地今年种麦亦较去年增加，如元朝东石固村，群众讨论多种麦好处后，种了全村耕地百分之五十，比去年增加百分之二十，该县二区北李庄原计划种麦，占耕地百分之四十，现已超过计划，种了百分之四十二点五，原计划每亩麦地上粪两车，现上两车半，冀南全区留麦地已全都种上，目前正耕种茬地。
    在突击种麦及秋收中，群众普遍的自动拨工互助，克服人力、畜力的困难。晋县七个区五十九村调查，八八八个互助组中，有三八○个是群众原有的互助组织，蠡县大曲堤、博野南辛庄，群众自然互助组织，约占全村户数百分之廿五到卅，清苑温仁村，因牲口缺乏，群众在插犋基础上组织了三十九个互助组共一五九户，大都是小型互助。但因群众有各种不同的具体需要，因而互助组形式亦多种多样，计有：牲口合犋，人力换畜力，人力互助拉耠拉耧，女工换男工，轻活换重活，分家兄弟因劳力少又合伙做活，亲朋串忙等，其中多临时性的拨换工，但也有较长期合作坚持多年的。这些群众自然互助组织都是自愿的结合，虽没有明确的计工等制度，但有群众自然的等价原则，现冀中正在研究这一初步组织劳动互助的自然形式，使之逐渐提高，达到有领导的组织起来。
    发动群众组织生产互助，冀中在秋收种麦中取得了下面四点经验：（一）宣传、酝酿，少在白天开大会，多在晚上开小会，多在自然场合，不拘形式，一面说，一面讨论，人也越来越多，但事先要有调查和准备。（二）以群众创造教育群众，区干深入群众自然互助小组里面去领导，具体帮助解决困难，把群众原有互助提高一步，加以鼓励、表扬，并广播出去，推动别人。（三）依靠积极分子，但不要只限于党员干部身上，更要在群众中发现真正的生产中的积极分子，庄稼把式，把他们鼓动起来，带动别人。（四）群众自然互助组织，绝大多数由于合养牲口、投脾气、慢慢发展互助合作，土改后，群众合养牲口很多，要在这个基础上发展劳动互助组织。
    今年种麦的组织领导，冀中、冀南都有很大改进，冀南区党委除利用党报，发表社论，加强种麦报导，以指导种麦外，更建立一种工作检查制度，调区村干部开调查会，了解种麦中的实际情况，有哪些困难？如何克服？上面决议是否适合下面实际情况等，经过研究，提出解决办法，再用电话、写信、写指示等办法下达，及时解决问题。这一工作检查制度，冀南区党委已指示各地委县委普遍采用。
    在今年尽量多种麦的方针下，冀中、冀南两地都发生了单纯追求数目字的偏向，有些县决定种麦多少，不根据群众人力、畜力、积肥多少，以及地湿程度等条件，领导上主观提出数字要求，有些县甚至逐级布置到村，产生区村干部强迫命令。特别是缺乏肥料，多种麦不但不能增加产量，反而会减低产量，平原柴草缺乏，造柴肥、草肥很少，群众多无力买肥。目前土地产量较战前减低，肥料缺乏是主要原因。冀中、冀南区党委均已注意纠正这一偏向，为了作好明年大生产工作，冀南区党委并提出领导群众大量积肥和冬耕，为种麦工作完成以后，领导群众进行生产的主要课题。
