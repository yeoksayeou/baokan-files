　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. A certain directly subordinate organ of the CCP Central Committee has established a regular organ school in order to improve the cultural level of its on-the-job personnel. The school is currently divided into two departments, primary and secondary (currently only the first year of junior high school), and classes began on September 1st, with a total of 340 students. The school's educational policy stipulates that necessary compulsory cultural education be conducted for on-the-job personnel. All on-the-job personnel who do not have a cultural level equivalent to junior high school graduation must enroll, regardless of their rank as cadres or service staff.

　　According to the school's experience, organ schools have the following characteristics that differ from general schools: (1) Students all have certain positions and cannot attend classes all day long, and their working hours also vary; (2) Students have uneven levels of knowledge; (3) Students are generally adults. All school systems, curricula, teaching materials, teaching methods, etc., must adapt to the above characteristics.

　　In terms of the school system, the school stipulates two years for junior primary school, one year for senior primary school, and two years for junior high school. Within these five years, the main courses of four years of junior primary school, two years of senior primary school, and three years of junior high school will be completed. Each grade is further divided into two semesters, front and back, and classes are opened simultaneously. Enrollment requires written and oral tests, mainly based on the level of Chinese language proficiency, while also considering the level of natural science knowledge, and students are assigned to classes accordingly. Class time is stipulated as two hours per day, twelve hours per week, and twenty weeks per semester. Except for February, which is winter vacation, and August, which is summer vacation, classes can be held for ten months each year. The daily class time is determined according to the time when the majority of students in each class can attend, from 6:30 in the morning to 11:30 in the morning, so as not to interfere with work. The school implements the same examination, roll call, and leave application systems as ordinary regular schools.

　　In terms of curriculum, the school currently stipulates: In the first year of junior primary school, eight hours per week are devoted to teaching Chinese (combined with general knowledge), and four hours to arithmetic. In the second year of junior primary school, six hours per week are devoted to teaching Chinese (including calligraphy and composition), two hours to arithmetic, and two hours to abacus calculation. In senior primary school, five hours per week are devoted to teaching Chinese (including composition), two hours to arithmetic, one hour to Chinese history, and one hour to Chinese geography. In the first year of junior high school, four hours per week are devoted to teaching Chinese, two hours to Chinese history (the first semester teaches ancient to Qing dynasty history, the second semester teaches the history of the last 100 years), one hour to Chinese geography, one hour to physiology and hygiene, two hours to nature (the first semester teaches the history of natural development, the second semester teaches animals and plants), and two hours to arithmetic. When the second year of junior high school is opened in the future, it is planned to add world geography, world history, physics, and algebra.

　　The school currently has 340 students divided into seven classes, including four junior primary classes, two senior primary classes, and one junior high class, which are taught separately. Each class is divided into several groups based on the students' work and region. In terms of faculty, there are currently one full-time primary and secondary school head teacher each, four class teachers, and five part-time teachers.

　　At the beginning of the school's opening, some on-the-job personnel did not value regular cultural learning. However, two weeks after classes began, the number of students increased from 278 to 340. Currently, the general student learning enthusiasm is very high. Some night workers often go to sleep after finishing class in the morning after work. They feel that studying in this school with a regular system allows them to concentrate and not be disturbed, making it easy to progress, and the courses are numerous and practical. Upon graduation, they can gain a lot of knowledge. The school has encountered some difficulties in teaching. One is that some students feel that the course content is too low or too high and cannot adapt, requiring appropriate adjustments to the class schedule. Another is that some students feel that there are too many courses taught and lack time for review, making it difficult to digest. This difficulty requires students to seize the time to study on their own, and also requires administrative leaders to consider improving the work system and methods in order to free up review time for them.

　　According to the school's experience, the central key to running an organ school well lies in: the responsible personnel of the organ must attach importance to the regular cultural learning of on-the-job personnel, and regard it as a major political task to improve cadres and improve work, and fully promote and support it, and mobilize and persuade all personnel with low cultural levels to participate in learning. Secondly, it is necessary to establish a certain organization and equip it with certain cadres to be specifically responsible for handling it, and the head of the organ should also serve as the principal, responsible for leading and supervising. Thirdly, it is also necessary to allocate certain funds to purchase essential educational tools, etc., in order to run the school well. This method of organ schools can be tried in all consolidated liberated areas at the county level and above.

### 中共中央某直属机关　创办正规机关学校　提高在职人员的文化水平

　　中共中央某直属机关
  　创办正规机关学校
  　提高在职人员的文化水平
    【新华社陕北十七日电】中共中央某直属机关为了提高在职人员的文化水平，创办了正规的机关学校。该校现分小学、中学（现仅有初中一年级）两部，已于九月一日开学上课，共有学生三百四十人。该校教育方针规定为对在职人员进行必要的带有强迫性质的文化教育。凡在职人员不及初中毕业的文化程度者，不论其为何级干部或勤杂人员，均须入学。
    根据该校经验，机关学校具有如下的和一般学校不同的特点：（一）学生均有一定的职务，不能整天上课，其工作时间亦参差不一；（二）学生程度不齐；（三）学生年龄，一般均为成年。一切学制、课程、教材、教学方法等，必须适应以上特点。
    在学制方面，该校规定初小二年，高小一年，初中二年，在此五年内学完初小四年、高小二年、初中三年的主要课程。每一个年级，又分为前后两学期，同时开班。入学须经笔试与口试，主要以国文程度为标准，同时亦考虑到自然科学知识的程度，分别编班。授课时间，规定每天二小时，每周十二小时，二十周为一学期。除二月份为寒假，八月份为暑假外，每年可上课十个月。每日上课时间，依各班学生大多数可以上课的时间而定，从早晨六时半到午前十一时半，以免妨碍工作。该校实行与普通正规学校同样的考试、点名、请假等制度。
    在课程方面，该校现规定：初小一年级每周教国语（与常识合编）八小时，算术四小时。初小二年级每周教国语（包括习字、作文）六小时，算术二小时，珠算二小时。高小每周教国语（包括作文）五小时，算术二小时，中国历史一小时，中国地理一小时。初中一年级每周教国文四小时，中国历史二小时（上学期教古代至清代史，下学期教近百年史），中国地理一小时，生理卫生一小时，自然二小时（上学期教自然发展史，下学期教动植物），算术二小时。初中二年级将来开办时，拟增授世界地理、世界历史、物理、代数等。
    该校现将三百四十名学生编成七个班，计初小四班，高小二班，初中一班，分别上课。每班以学生的工作和地区为单位，分成若干小组。教职员方面，现有专任的中、小学主任教员各一人和级任教员四人，业余授课的教员五人。
    该校开学之初，一部分在职人员并不重视正规的文化学习。但开课两周以后，学生即由二百七十八人增至三百四十人。现一般学生学习情绪甚高。有些夜间工作人员，往往下班后等天明上完课再去睡觉。他们觉得这种有正规制度的学校学习，可以专心一志，不受打扰，容易进步，课程多而实用，学成毕业，可以得到许多知识。该校在教学上曾经遇到一些困难，其一是：有的学生对课程内容感觉太低或太高，不能适应，需要适当的调整班次。另一是有的学生觉得所教课程太多，缺少复习时间，消化不了。这个困难一方面要靠学生自己抓紧时间学习，另一方面要由行政负责人考虑改善工作制度和方法，以便给他们誊出复习时间。
    根据该校经验，要办好机关学校，其中心关键在于：机关负责人员要重视在职人员的正规的文化学习，把它当作是提高干部、改进工作的一个重大的政治任务，而全力加以促成和支持，并动员说服所有文化水平低的人员参加学习。其次，必须建立一定的机构及配备一定的干部，专门负责办理，并由机关首长兼任校长，负责领导督促。再次，又须划出一定的经费，购置必不可少的教育用具等等，才能把学校办好。这种机关学校的办法，一切巩固的解放区的县级以上的机关都可以试办。
