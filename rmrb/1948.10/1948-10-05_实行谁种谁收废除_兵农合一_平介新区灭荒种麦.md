[Jinzhong Telegram] Farmers in the new districts of Fenyang, Jiexiu, Pingyao, and other counties are universally launching a campaign to eliminate wasteland and sow winter wheat (autumn sowing is called winter wheat, spring sowing is called spring wheat). Before liberation, Fenyang had 60,000 mu of wasteland, Jiexiu had 66,000 mu, and Pingyao had more than 77,000 mu. After liberation, the democratic government announced the abolition of the "soldier-farmer integration" system. For those who had previously implemented rent reduction and interest reduction to fairly distribute land, but whose land had been seized back by landlords and rich peasants, the policy of "land belongs to the original owner," i.e., it belongs to the peasants, was implemented. For those who had not implemented double reduction and land reform, adjustments were made based on the specific circumstances of the Yan bandit's "soldier-farmer integration." The method of "whoever plants harvests, 30% for the government and 70% for the people, plus adjustments" was implemented, so that 20% of landless peasants obtained land, stabilizing the emotions of people from all walks of life. Currently, a vigorous campaign to eliminate wasteland and sow wheat is underway.

To overcome the masses' fear of a change in the political situation, fear of burdens, and fear of equal distribution, Party, government, and civilian cadres in Pingyao, in conjunction with supporting the front, went deep into the villages to publicize the current situation and our Party's policies for the new district. The Fenyang County Government issued a notice announcing that whoever plants this year will harvest next year, those who cultivate wasteland will have their public grain reduced by half next year, and those who cultivate virgin land will be exempt from public grain next year, dispelling the masses' concerns about sowing wheat. If the masses lack seeds, livestock, etc., the government will find ways to solve them. The Fenyang County Government allocated 762 shi of wheat to solve the difficulty of wheat seeds in the new district. The Pingyao County Government also distributed more than 300 shi. The Jiexiu County Bank is preparing to issue 10 million yuan to solve the difficulties in severely affected areas.

In addition, the Fenyang County Government advocated private lending among the masses. The government guarantees that the borrower will definitely repay the lender. In order to adjust livestock power, the government mobilized the masses in the mountainous areas of the seventh district who do not grow wheat, and those in the border mountains who grow less wheat, to help the masses in the plains sow winter wheat with livestock under the principle of voluntary equal value, or to rent land in the plains to cultivate wasteland and sow winter wheat. Jiexiu mobilized women and children to collect manure and cut artemisia, and began to organize small labor teams. The seven members of the West Lake Long Ren Yongjian mutual aid team have already sown 110 mu of wheat. Now, 70% of the more than 77,000 mu of wasteland in Pingyao has been eliminated, and 80% of the county's more than 300,000 mu of wheat fields have been sown, which is earlier and faster than any previous year. In Jiexiu, 70% or more of the wasteland in the first, second, third, and fourth districts has been eliminated. More than 260 mu of the more than 300 mu of wasteland in Zhanglan Town, District 1, has been eliminated. In villages such as Mabi, Zhangcun, and Shicun, 80% of the winter wheat has been sown. Xilong Village has sown all 55 mu of wasteland. Fenyang has sown more than 100,000 mu of winter wheat and is striving to sow more winter wheat in the more than 40,000 mu of wasteland that has been cultivated. Currently, the counties are continuing to vigorously eliminate wasteland and sow wheat.

　　实行谁种谁收废除“兵农合一”
    平介新区灭荒种麦
    【晋中电】汾阳、介休、平遥等县新区农民普遍展开消灭荒地、播种宿麦（秋种称宿麦，春种称春麦）运动。解放前，汾阳有荒地六万亩，介休有六万六千亩，平遥有七万七千余亩。解放后，民主政府宣布废除“兵农合一”制度，其过去已实行过减租减息平分土地，而又为地主富农将土地夺回者，则实行“地归原主”即归农民所有，其未实行过双减土改，则根据阎贼“兵农合一”实施的具体情况，加以调剂。实行“谁种谁收、三七分青、外加调剂”的办法，使百分之二十的无地农民，得到土地，安定了各阶层人民的情绪。目前正大力灭荒种麦。为克服群众怕变天、怕负担、怕平分思想，平遥党政民干部与支前结合，深入各村宣传目前形势与我党新区政策。汾阳县府颁发布告，宣布今年谁种明年谁收，开熟荒明年公粮减半，开生荒明年免征公粮，解除了群众种麦顾虑。群众缺乏种籽牲畜等，政府均设法予以解决。汾阳县政府拨出七六二石麦子，解决新区麦籽困难。平遥县政府也发放三百余石。介休县银行准备发放一千万元，解决灾重区困难。此外，汾阳县政府提倡群众私人借贷。政府保证借方一定归还。为了调剂畜力，政府发动了七区山上不种麦与边山种麦少的群众，在自愿等价原则下，以牲畜帮助平川群众播种宿麦，或在平川租地开荒种宿麦。介休动员了妇女儿童拾粪割蒿，并开始组织了小型拨工组。西湖龙任永建互助组七个人，已将一百一十亩麦种完。现在平遥七万七千余亩荒地，已消灭了百分之七十，全县三十余万亩麦田，已下种十分之八，比以往任何一年又早又快。介休一、二、三、四四个区已消灭荒地百分之七十以上。一区张兰镇三百余亩荒地，已消灭了二百六十余亩。马壁、张村、史村等村宿麦已下种十分之八。西龙村将五十五亩荒地全部下种。汾阳宿麦已下种十万亩以上。并争取在已开出的四万余亩荒地中多种宿麦。现各县正在继续大力灭荒种麦中。
