　　Can Medical Expenses of Retired Veterans Be Reimbursed?
    Question: My name is Wu Xianqing, I am 33 years old, from Sichuan. I joined the Red Army in 1932 and was later disabled. I retired from the army in June 1946 and settled in Changzi County, Taiyue District. Because I have a serious internal illness, I went to the Peace Hospital of the Border Region Government for treatment this time. They are not responsible for the medical expenses and food expenses. I paid for the food myself. They asked me to get reimbursement for the medical expenses from the Taiyue District Commissioner's Office. The Commissioner's Office replied that medical expenses can be reimbursed if the wound recurs, but not for internal illnesses. Please tell me why they cannot be reimbursed? (Wu Xianqing, Honorary Soldier, Changzi County)
    Question: I recently received a letter from a disabled friend who has already retired, saying that his wound often recurs. This time he went to the North China Hospital for recuperation and spent some money, and his family life is difficult. May I ask if the government can send him to a public hospital for free treatment? (Li Ri×, Health Brigade, Second Team)
    Answer: If a veteran's wound recurs after retirement and he goes to a public hospital for treatment, in addition to handing over the food ration he is entitled to, the public can be responsible for reimbursing the shortfall. If he goes to a public hospital for treatment due to illness, he should still be responsible for the necessary food and medical expenses. When receiving treatment in a public hospital, medical expenses may be reduced appropriately to show preferential treatment. If he has a better life and can afford this expense, he does not need to ask the public to pay for it. If he is indeed in difficulty and cannot solve the problem, he can ask the local government for a subsidy. (Ministry of Civil Affairs)

　　荣退军人的医药费能不能报销？
    问：我名叫吴显清，三十三岁，四川人，一九三二年参加红军，后来残废了，一九四六年六月退伍，在太岳区长子县安家。我因有内病很严重，这次到边区政府和平医院治病，医药费伙食费人家概不负责，伙食由自己出了，医药费他们叫我到太岳区专署报销，专署答复要是伤口复发，医药费能报销，如有内病，医药费不能报销。请问为什么不能报销？（长子县荣誉军人吴显清）
    问：我近来接到一位已经退了伍的残废友人来信说：伤口经常复发，此次他到华北医院休养，花了一部分钱，家中生活又困苦。请问政府能不能送公共医院给以免费治疗？（健康大队、二中队李日×）
    答：荣军退伍后伤口复发，到公立医院治疗，除将自己应领之供给粮交出外，其不足之部分，可由公家负责报销。如系因疾病而到公立医院治疗，所需之火食医药费，仍应归本人负责。在公立医院治疗时，医药费可以酌予减收，以示优待。如自己生活较好，能负担此一费用时，就不必再要求公家开支；如自己确实困难，不能解决时，可请当地政府补助一部。（民政部）
