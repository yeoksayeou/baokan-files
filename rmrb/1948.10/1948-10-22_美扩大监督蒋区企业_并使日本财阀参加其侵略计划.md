　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th—American imperialism is continuously expanding the scope of its supervision and monopoly over industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and further promoting its plan of "Industrial Japan, Raw Materials China." Following the Kuomintang government's announcement on September 1st that the Yangtze Power Company, Jibei Electric Power Company, Kailuan Coal Mine Bureau, and Taiwan Sugar Company would accept American supervision, the US "Economic Cooperation Administration" announced on September 13th in Washington a so-called "New Plan under the Industrial Parts Supplementation Program." According to Yan Jiagan, a member of the Kuomintang US Aid Utilization Committee, in a report to the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan on the 12th of this month: The plan stipulates that the Yuehan Railway, Zhegan Railway, the Pingjin section of the Beining Railway, the Taiwan Railway, Chongqing Electric Power Company, Hankou Hydropower Company, Taiwan Power Company, the Huazhong and Huanan small power plants under the Kuomintang Resources Committee's Electric Power Department, and power plants in Qingdao, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and even the Kuomintang customs anti-smuggling agencies, are all placed under American supervision. American imperialism is also allowing Japanese zaibatsu to participate in this plan, assisting the United States in its joint aggression against China. The US Economic Cooperation Administration has repeatedly announced: "The Chinese economic recovery plan will complement the Japanese economic recovery plan," "Some factories use Japanese-made machinery, and China needs to purchase some goods from Japan," advocating "China should supply Japan with iron ore," and "Transport large quantities of Chinese iron sand to Japanese steel mills for re-smelting into finished products" to supply the Kuomintang government.

　　美扩大监督蒋区企业
  　并使日本财阀参加其侵略计划
    【新华社陕北十九日电】美帝国主义对国民党统治区工、矿、交通等项企业的监督垄断范围不断扩大，并进一步推行其“工业日本原料中国”的计划。继九月一日国民党政府宣布扬子电力公司、冀北电力公司、开滦煤矿局、台糖公司接受美国监督后，美国“经济合作总署”又于九月十三日在华盛顿宣布一所谓“工业配件补充方案项下的新计划”。据国民党美援运用委员会委员严家淦本月十二日在国民党立法院报告中披露：该计划规定将粤汉铁路、浙赣铁路、北宁铁路平津段、台湾铁路、重庆电力公司、汉口水电公司、台湾电力公司、国民党资委会电业处所属华中及华南各小型电厂及青岛、沈阳、太原等地电力厂，甚至国民党海关缉私机构等，皆划归美国监管。美帝国主义并使日本财阀亦参加到该项计划中，协助美国共同侵略中国。美经合总署一再宣布：“中国经济复兴计划将与日本经济复原计划相辅而成”，“若干工厂系使用日本制机器，中国需自日本购买若干货品”，主张“由中国供应日本铁苗”，“将中国大量铁砂装运日本炼钢厂再制出成品”供应国民党政府。
