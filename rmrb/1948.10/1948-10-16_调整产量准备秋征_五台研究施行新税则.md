　　Adjust Production to Prepare for Autumn Grain Collection
  　Wutai Studies and Implements New Tax Rules
    [North Yue News] Wutai County convened a meeting of county cadres, district secretaries, district heads, finance assistants, and county resident representatives in the latter part of last month, and invited nineteen veteran farmers to participate. The meeting discussed and arranged for the revision of agricultural tax and the adjustment of production. (1) Conducting focused sampling inspections to adjust production, so as to achieve a general balance throughout the county, is the central content of this year's revision of agricultural tax and the adjustment of production. In order to complete this work on time with a short period and many tasks, and without affecting the autumn grain collection allocation, after repeated research and discussion in general and small meetings, and with veteran farmers and cadres, and based on the land quality, operating conditions, people's living conditions, and past consolidated tax production determination in various districts of the county, specific requirements for each district to approach the real normal annual production were determined (average yield per mu of irrigated and dry land, and total output), and production standards for each district were made. Then, district-level village cadres and veteran farmer meetings were held to unfold discussions, comparing land, comparing truth and falsehood, comparing the virtual and the real (comparing with the past consolidated tax production determination), and evaluating the specific requirements of each village (total output and average output). After arriving in the villages, methods such as self-reporting and public discussion were used to evaluate the production of each household and each land grade. In order to understand the production situation in various parts of the county and promote overall work, the county production adjustment committee transferred thirty county and district cadres and county resident representatives and ten veteran farmers to form eight survey teams to conduct focused sampling inspections in various districts, comparing the consolidated tax production, the newly determined production, and the surveyed production, to verify the authenticity and balance of each district and village, as a basis for autumn grain collection allocation.
    (2) In terms of specific practices, methods such as mutual sampling comparison between districts and villages, household self-reporting, democratic appraisal, and representative rotational surveys should be used to achieve a general balance and truthfulness.
    (3) In terms of ideological leadership, it is emphasized to follow the mass line, overcome departmentalism and localism, and rely on the representative meetings and trust the representative meetings in the work. Each survey team should pay attention to and listen to the opinions of the county representatives and the masses in their team. During the survey, prevent trampling on young crops and pay attention to taking care of agricultural work.
    (4) In order not to affect support for the front and to complete this task on schedule, each village has prepared two sets of cadres. Before the support for the front comes, the entire village will be mobilized to carry out this work. After the support for the front begins, the village chief, grain officer, and production committee member will also remain in the village to lead and grasp this work and lead production. The county and districts have also assigned special personnel to be responsible for grasping it, so as not to relax this work due to the central task.

　　调整产量准备秋征
  　五台研究施行新税则
    【北岳讯】五台县于上月下旬召开县干、区书、区长、财政助理及县驻会代表会议，并邀请了十九位老农参加。会上讨论与布置了改订农业税调整产量工作。（一）进行有重点的抽查，调整产量，达到全县范围内之大体上平衡，这是今年改订农业税调整产量的中心内容。为了能在时间短任务多的情况下按时完成这一工作，而不影响秋征分配，经过大会、小会研究讨论，和老农干部的反复讨论，又根据全县各区土地质量，经营条件，群众生活情形，以及过去统累税定产量情形，定出各区接近真实常年产量的具体要求（水旱地每亩平均产量及总产量），并作出各区定产标准，然后区级再召开村干部老农会议，展开讨论。比土地、比真假、比虚实（比过去统累税定产），评定各村具体要求（总产量及平均产量）。到村后，运用自报公议等办法，评定各户各地等产量。为了解全县各地定产情况，推动全面工作，县调整产量委员会抽调县区干部及县驻会代表三十人和老农十人，组成八个勘察组，分赴各区进行重点抽查，以统累税产量，新定产量，勘察产量对比，印证各区村真实程度和平衡程度。以作秋征分配的依据。
    （二）具体做法上，应运用区村间互相抽查比较，户主自报，民主评议，代表轮流勘察等办法，以求达到大体平衡真实。
    （三）在思想领导上，强调走群众路线，克服本位思想和地方主义，工作中要依靠代表会相信代表会。各勘察组应注意及听取本组县代表及群众意见，勘察中防止踏践青苗，注意照顾农时。
    （四）为不影响支前又能按期完成这一任务，各村都准备两套干部，支前未来前，全体动员进行这一工作，支前开始后村长、粮秣、生产委员也要留村领导掌握这一工作和领导生产，县区也确定专人负责掌握，不致因中心而放松这一工作。
