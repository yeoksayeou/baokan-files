　　Retired Veterans Should Have Supply Grain Stopped When Employed
    Question: Li Xiaojing, a disabled veteran of the first class (missing a leg) in our county, returned home after being discharged and became an elementary school teacher. In the past few years, supply grain was issued according to veteran status. The new regulations this year state that supply grain will be stopped and honorary money issued to anyone who is employed. Therefore, Comrade Xiaojing is not very understanding, so he raised this for discussion: Does he count as employed? Should he still be issued supply grain as a veteran? Some managers of village cooperatives are also retired veterans. Cooperatives provide supplies according to cadre treatment. Should they still be issued veteran supply grain? For example, Chen Wenyuan, the deputy manager of the Tan Village Cooperative, receives cadre treatment and also receives veteran supply grain. Is it right to issue them supply grain? (Cui Tianshen, Wu Rongsheng)
    Answer: When veterans return home after being discharged, those who are disabled in battle, losing part of their productivity, are categorized as first or second class disabled veterans. The government provides a certain amount of supply grain to ensure that veterans can maintain a certain standard of living after settling down. If their health has recovered and they are employed in government offices, receiving supply system or salary system treatment, the supply grain should be stopped during the period of employment. However, in order to take care of the veteran's health and ensure they receive a certain amount of nutrition, it is stipulated that in addition to the supplies provided to general on-the-job personnel, a certain amount of disability allowance will also be given.
    If they are engaged in private enterprises (such as village cooperatives), regardless of the treatment, the veteran supply grain should not be cancelled in principle. However, if their livelihood can be maintained, they can be mobilized to voluntarily stop receiving part or all of the supply grain, based on the current public financial difficulties.
    If a veteran is an elementary school teacher and the treatment reaches the level of the supply system in government offices, the supply grain should also be stopped. If the treatment does not reach the level of the supply system, the supply grain should not be stopped, but he can only be mobilized to stop receiving part or all of it.

　　荣退军人参加工作应停发供给粮
    问：我县荣退军人李效敬是一等残废，（缺一条腿）退伍回家，就担任小学教员，过去几年按荣军发供给粮，今年新规定上说：凡参加工作者停发供给粮，发荣誉金。所以效敬同志思想不很通，因此提出研究，他是否算参加工作？该不该按荣军发给供给粮。村合作社经理有的也是荣退军人，合作社是按干部待遇供给，是否还发给他荣军供给粮？如潭村合作社陈文元他任副经理，是按干部待遇，又领了荣军供给粮，发给他们供给粮对不对？（崔天申、吴荣生）
    答：荣军退伍回家，因其作战残废，失去了部分生产力之一二等荣军。政府给以一定的供给粮，是为了使荣军安家后能维持一定的生活水平。如身体已恢复健康，参加机关工作，取得供给制，或薪金制待遇，在参加工作期间，供给粮即应停发。但为了照顾荣军身体，使能得到一定的营养，所以规定除按一般在职人员供给外，而又领给一定的残废金。
    如参加的是民营事业（如村合作社）不论如何待遇，原则上不应取消其荣军供给粮。但如其生活能够维持，可以依据今天公家财政困难的情况，动员其自动停领供给粮的一部分或全部。
    荣军当小学教员，待遇达到了机关供给制的程度，应同样停发其供给粮；待遇未达到供给制的程度，则不应停发其供给粮，只可动员他停领一部或全部。（民政部）
