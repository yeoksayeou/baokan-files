Beiyue Telegraph: The Beiyue Military Region Armed Forces Department, at its recent conference of district and county department heads, issued a stern criticism of the phenomenon of illegally mobilizing and wasting civilian labor. Given the current large-scale operations, the masses already bear a considerable burden of logistical support. In some key transportation areas and regions with heavy logistical demands, each person serves an average of ten workdays per month. In Xiaojue Station, Jianping, each person required to perform labor served 9.5 workdays in May. In Jiuligou, Yuxian County, Sixth District, each person required to perform labor averaged eleven workdays from April to June. An investigation in Zhaowangtai, Fuping, revealed that the labor burden (converted to rice) in 1947 was one-third greater than the financial burden. However, many organizations fail to understand the plight of the people and continue to illegally mobilize labor. For example, when the Zhengding County government offices moved in April, they mobilized 227 carts without compensation (the county government used 150 carts, the county party committee used 70 carts, and the county armed forces department used 7 carts). Also in April, when a shoe factory run by an organization moved from a village in Guangling to a village in Pingshan, they mobilized 20 carts without compensation. Sometimes, poor planning leads to wasted manpower and livestock. Once, when the military region's ordnance department transported uniforms, they mobilized 293 animals from Chenzhuang Station, only for the animals to return without delivering the uniforms. They also requested more than 200 animals from Chatou Station, which waited in vain for half a day. A particularly serious incident occurred when the wife of Director X of the Peace Hospital died, and forty-eight people were used to carry the coffin from the Sixth District to his home, a journey of two days per station because the coffin was too good and too heavy. To avoid difficulties when livestock are requested, cadres in Goupo Village, Lingqiu, divided the village's large livestock into three shifts of six animals each, requiring them to remain at home even when not needed, significantly hindering production. The reason for this is that leaders at all levels and in all departments have not paid enough attention to cherishing civilian labor and saving labor service, and their organization, leadership, and management are inadequate. To overcome this phenomenon, the conference made the following specific regulations: 1. Leaders at all levels should lead by example and strictly prohibit the illegal mobilization and waste of civilian labor. They should carefully review and control mobilization certificates. 2. Appropriately increase the number of messengers to send messages and assign tasks at any time, resolutely abolish the practice of having people and animals wait at stations, and correct and overcome the phenomenon of some transportation station cadres wasting civilian labor for their own convenience. 3. Mobilization agencies at all levels should coordinate with logistical departments in advance and mobilize civilian labor in a planned and prepared manner to overcome the waste of civilian labor. 4. Strictly implement mobilization procedures, and station chiefs have the right to stop or refuse illegal mobilization of civilian labor. 5. Transportation stations should plan and organize the use of the station's total power. Under normal circumstances, do not mobilize labor from the village where the station is located or nearby villages. In urgent situations, temporary mobilization should be carried out. Transport between stations should promote return trips to improve transportation efficiency, in order to regulate civilian labor and overcome waste.

　　纠正非法动用民力
    北岳武装部长会议规定办法
    【北岳电】北岳军区武装部在最近召开的分区、县部长会议上，对非法动员浪费民力的现象作了严正的批评。因为当前大规模作战，群众勤务负担已相当重。有些交通要道与勤务重的地区，每人每月服勤达到十个工上下。建屏小觉站五月份每个应服勤的人每人达九点五个工。六分区蔚县九履口四、五、六月份每个应服勤的人，平均达十一个工。阜平照旺台的调查，一九四七年份劳力负担（折米）比财政负担多三分之一。但有许多机关不能体会民困，仍在非法动用勤务。如四月份正定县机关搬家，毫无代价的动员了大车二百二十七辆（县政府用了一百五十辆，县委用了七十辆，县武装部用了七辆）。四月份机关生产的鞋厂从广灵某村往平山某村搬家，也无代价的动员了大车二十辆。有的事先计划不好，浪费了人畜力，一次军区军械处运军装，从陈庄站动员牲口二百九十三头，结果因军装未能发到，牲口白跑了一趟。同时也从岔头站要了二百多头牲口，也白等了半天。特别严重的是和平医院×院长的老婆死后，从六分区往家运灵，因棺材太好太重，用了四十八人抬运，一站得走两天时间。灵邱沟坡村干部为了避免要牲口时作难，竟把村中大牲口分成三班，每班六头，没事也得在家等着，耽误生产很多。其原因，是各级各部门领导上对爱惜民力、节省劳役注意不够，组织领导和管理上不适当。为克服此种现象，会议特作如下规定：一、各级领导应以身作则，严禁非法动员与浪费民力，应认真审查与掌握动员证。二、适当的增设交通员，随时送信派勤，坚决取缔人畜听站的办法，纠正和克服某些交通站干部为自己方便而浪费民力的现象。三有各级动员机关应事先协同勤务部门，有计划、准备的动员民力，克服浪费民力现象。四、严格执行动员手续，站长有权制止或拒绝非法动员民力的行为。五、交通站有计划的组织与使用全站动力。在一般情况下不动员站所在村或附近村的勤务。紧急情况下临时动员，站与站之间要提倡回运，提高运输效率，以达到调剂民力，克服浪费。
