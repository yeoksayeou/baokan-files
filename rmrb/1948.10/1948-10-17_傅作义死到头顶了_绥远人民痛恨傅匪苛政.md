　　“Fu Zuoyi's End is Near”
  　Suiyuan People Bitterly Hate Fu Bandit's Oppressive Rule

    The people of Suiyuan can no longer live under Fu Zuoyi's tyranny. For the past two years, Fu Bandit has universally implemented a fascist Baojia system, ID cards, and collective responsibility laws in Suiyuan. Secret agents are everywhere, and forced conscription is rampant. From September of the year before last to May of this year, Fu Bandit has forcibly conscripted over 60,000 young men in Suiyuan. Last year alone, there were four conscription drives. Taking Shapo Kiln Village in Tuoketuo County, with over 300 households, as an example, 165 people were seized in the four conscription drives last year. The cry everywhere is "catch the vagrants", creating a state of terror. When the common people hear that the Fu bandits are coming, they shout, "The wolves are coming!" During the conscription drives, many tragedies occurred, such as gouging out eyes and severing fingers. Yang Huanzi, 47 years old, from Naogai Village in Taolin, rubbed waterpipe tobacco into his right eye, blinding himself. Ma Er, a Hui resident in Guisui City, cut off four of his fingers with a knife. Passive resistance cannot stop Fu Bandit's ferocity. The people of Suiyuan have held many anti-conscription actions. The police team of Wuchuan County escorted more than 300 conscripted men to Guisui, but they all ran away midway. In Fengzhen city, two young men beat two conscription bandits to death and fled to the liberated areas.
    Fu Bandit's harsh taxes and levies are extremely cruel. The provincial grain levy alone reaches 800,000 large stones (each large stone being 300 catties). Adding the county, township public grain, and miscellaneous levies, the people's gains are almost completely plundered. Many people sell their wives and children to pay the public grain, and finally leave their homes in tears to flee the famine. Large areas of land are left barren. According to statistics from the Construction Department of the Kuomintang Suiyuan Provincial Government last year, the total cultivated land is only one-tenth of the total arable land area, which means that under Fu Bandit's rule in Suiyuan, barren land accounts for nine-tenths. This summer, the famine has spread throughout the province. In the Yimeng area alone, thousands of people have starved to death, and in Sarachi County, over a thousand people have starved to death.
    In order to prolong his reactionary rule, Fu Bandit once announced "Ten Killing Orders": those who do not run away during the clearing of the fields and houses will be killed; those who hide "bandit" scouts (falsely accusing the People's Liberation Army) will be killed; those who do not send intelligence will be killed; and those who show any resistance or dissatisfaction will be killed. This year, when our army withdrew from Fengzhen, Fu Bandit killed 38 people at one time on the grounds that they had received our relief grain. After Fu Bandit occupied Suiyuan East, the landlords' arrogance soared. In Datong, Fengzhen, Liangcheng and other areas, they carried out reverse accounting against the peasants. Many peasants had their ears cut off or were even beaten to death. More than a thousand people from Zuoyun in Yanbei were buried alive and shot. This was confirmed by the corpses salvaged from the wells when our army recovered Zuoyun this spring.
    The people of Suiyuan really cannot endure it any longer. Before this campaign, people in many places had already broken out in sporadic armed resistance. Our local armed forces and democratic government have always persisted in their positions amidst the enemy's constant "encirclements and suppressions" and have developed vigorously. This spring, three or four villages in Majiakulun, Liangcheng, joined the army 150 people at a time. Jia Wang from Shuangshanzi Village brought nine young and strong men to automatically join our Iron Cavalry. The Fengzhen East Guerrilla, developed from dozens of people to several hundred. The people of Suiyuan have recognized their own path in suffering. When the Sui-Mongolian battle started this time, the people warmly welcomed our army. Regardless of Fu Bandit's threat of beheading, the people refused to carry out his scorched earth policy and actively supported our army's operations. They said, "Fu Zuoyi's end is near this time."

### “傅作义死到头顶了”　绥远人民痛恨傅匪苛政

　　“傅作义死到头顶了”
  　绥远人民痛恨傅匪苛政
    绥远人民在傅作义蹂躏下活不下去了。二年来傅匪在绥远普遍推行法西斯的保甲制度、身份证、连坐法，特务密布，疯狂抓丁。自前年九月到今年五月，傅匪在绥远抓捕壮丁达六万人以上。仅去年即抓丁四次，以托克托县三百余户之沙坡窑村为例，在去年四次抓丁中即被抓去一百六十五人。到处“捉游民”，造成恐怖状态。老百姓听到傅匪一来，都喊狼来了。在抓丁中造成不少挖目断指等惨剧：陶林铙盖村四十七岁的杨焕子，用水烟揉瞎右眼；归绥城内回民马二，用刀砍去四个指头。消极抵抗煞不住傅匪的凶焰，绥远人民曾举行多次反抓丁行动：武川县保警队押送壮丁三百余人赴归绥，中途全部跑光。丰镇城内有两个青年将两个抓丁匪徒打死后投奔了解放区。
    傅匪苛征暴敛极为残酷，仅省征粮一项即达八十万大石（每大石三百斤），加上县、乡公粮和苛杂，人民所获几被掠夺净尽。很多人都是卖了老婆孩子交公粮，最后哭着离家去逃荒。土地大量荒芜，据国民党绥远省政府建设厅去年统计，全部已耕地仅及全部耕地面积的十分之一，这就是说在傅匪统治下的绥远，荒地竟达十分之九。今夏灾荒扩及全省，伊盟一地饿死数千人，萨拉齐县饿死千余人。
    傅匪为了苟延其反动统治，曾公布了“十杀令”，凡空室清野不跑者，隐蔽“匪”探（诬指人民解放军）者杀；不送情报者杀；稍有反抗不满者杀。今年我军撤离丰镇，傅匪竟以曾领我救济粮为罪名，一次即杀掉三十八人。傅匪侵占绥东后，地主气焰高涨，在大同、丰镇、凉城一带向农民实行倒算，许多农民被割掉耳朵或甚至打死。雁北左云人民千人以上被活埋和枪杀。这是今春我军收复左云时从水井中打捞出尸首所证实的。
    绥远人民实在不能忍受了。此次战役以前，不少地方人民已爆发零星的武装反抗。我地方武装及民主政府，在敌不断“围剿”中，始终坚持阵地，并得到蓬勃发展。今春凉城马家库伦三、四个村，一次参军一百五十余人。双山子村贾旺，带九个青壮年自动参加我铁骑队。丰（镇）东游击队，由几十个人发展到×百人。绥远人民在苦难中认清了自己的道路。当此次绥蒙战起时，人民热烈接待我军。人民不顾傅匪杀头威胁，拒绝执行其坚壁清野命令，并积极支援我军作战。他们说：“傅作义这次是死到头顶了”。
