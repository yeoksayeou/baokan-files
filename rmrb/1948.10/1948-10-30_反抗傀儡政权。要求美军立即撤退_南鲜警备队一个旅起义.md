　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. A soldier's uprising against the puppet regime broke out in Yeosu Port, on the southern coast of South Korea, on the 20th, and has developed into a widespread armed struggle. According to a TASS dispatch from Pyongyang radio on the 22nd, broadcasting South Korean news: The uprising army and the puppet government forces continue to engage in fierce battles on Jeju Island and Gwangju (the central city of South Jeolla Province). Leaflets demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea are widely circulating in Gwangju. According to news from British, American, and French news agencies: A whole brigade of 3,500 constabulary troops stationed in Yeosu mutinied because they refused to be transferred to Jeju Island to suppress the long-term anti-puppet regime guerrillas. After executing the reactionary officers and seizing American-made weapons and ammunition from the Yeosu military depot, the insurgents occupied Yeosu Port, then advanced north and captured Suncheon, 20 miles north of Yeosu, with large numbers of civilians joining along the way. After arriving in Suncheon, they split into two groups, one capturing Gwangyang, five miles northeast of Suncheon, reaching the outskirts of Gwangju; the other capturing Changhong (transliteration) west of Suncheon, as well as the railway cities of Boseong and Jangheung, 26 and 39 miles southwest of Suncheon. According to the puppet authorities, the puppet government forces suffered four to five hundred casualties on the first day of the uprising. As of the 25th, the battle was still ongoing on a 60-mile front parallel to the coast, with Yeosu, Suncheon, Boseong, Jangheung, and other places still in the hands of the insurgents. After the uprising broke out, the puppet government was very panicked, immediately declared a state of emergency, banned newspapers from publishing the news, and rushed troops and police trained by the U.S. military to the front line in Gwangju to block the attack. South Korean puppet President Syngman Rhee flew to Japan on the 19th to meet with MacArthur for instructions, and then hurriedly flew back to Seoul on the 20th. In a speech on the 22nd, Syngman Rhee shamelessly announced that U.S. troops would by no means withdraw from South Korea at present, and that MacArthur would "fulfill his responsibility to protect" the South Korean puppet regime.

　　反抗傀儡政权。要求美军立即撤退
  　南鲜警备队一个旅起义
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】南朝鲜海岸南端的丽水港于二十日爆发了反抗傀儡政权的士兵起义，并已发展成广泛的武装斗争。据塔斯社引平壤电台二十二日广播南朝鲜消息称：起义军和傀儡政府军在济州岛和光州（全罗南道中心城市）继续激战，光州广泛流传着要求美军立即撤出朝鲜的传单。据英、美、法各通讯社消息：驻扎丽水的警备队一个整旅三千五百人，因拒绝调往济州岛镇压长期反抗傀儡政权的游击队而举义。举义者在处决反动长官，夺取丽水军需站的美制武器弹药之后，占领了丽水港，接着向北推进，攻占丽水北二十哩的顺天，沿途有大批平民参加。抵顺天后又分成两路，一路攻占顺天东北五哩的光阳，直抵光州近郊；一路攻占顺天以西的彰洪（译音），以及顺天西南二十六哩与三十九哩的铁路城市宝城与长兴。据傀儡当局承认：在起义爆发的第一天，傀儡政府军已被击毙四五百人。截止二十五日止，战事仍在与海岸平行的六十哩战线上进行，丽水、顺天、宝城、长兴等地仍在起义军手中。起义发生后，傀儡政府非常恐慌，马上宣布紧急戒严，禁止报纸刊登该项新闻，并赶调由美军训练的军警前往光州前线堵击。南韩傀儡总统李承晚于十九日飞日会唔麦克阿瑟请示机宜，又于二十日匆匆飞返汉城。李承晚于二十二日发表的谈话中，曾无耻地宣布美军在目前决不撤离南朝鲜，麦克阿瑟将对南韩伪政权“尽其保护之责”。
