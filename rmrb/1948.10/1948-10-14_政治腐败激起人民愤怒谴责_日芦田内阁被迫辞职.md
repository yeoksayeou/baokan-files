Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Japanese people and public opinion, enraged and condemning the political corruption exposed by the bribery and malpractice case involving major bureaucrats and capitalists in the Showa Electric Company loan scandal, have forced the Ashida Cabinet to resign on the afternoon of the 7th. Previously, Ashida had attempted to overcome the cabinet crisis with the support of MacArthur. According to TASS, citing Japanese newspapers, Ashida declared at a cabinet meeting on the 5th that MacArthur's headquarters believed that the developing situation of the Showa case (referring to the arrest of Minister of State Takeo Kurisu) must be resolved as Kurisu's "personal matter." Ashida also hypocritically stated that the cabinet had "moral responsibility" for the Kurisu bribery case, attempting to shirk the blame for collusion in the malpractice. According to Reuters, MacArthur had expressed disapproval of the Ashida Cabinet resigning before the parliament passed the bills banning strikes and collective bargaining for civil servants in mid-month. However, Ashida's efforts to cling to power and MacArthur's assistance could not withstand the people's anger. Labor unions launched a protest movement against the large-scale corruption of senior figures in the economic and political circles (TASS). The Central Strike Committee of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union and the All-Japan Chemical Industry Workers' Union participated in this movement. Japanese public opinion sharply demanded the immediate resignation of the Ashida Cabinet. "Tokyo Shimbun," "Asahi Shimbun," and "Mainichi Shimbun," among others, condemned Ashida for shirking responsibility and clinging to power in the Showa scandal. Simultaneously, former Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Suehiro Nishio, was arrested on the 6th on charges of bribery and extortion. Nishio confessed that Shoji Ichimanda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Prime Minister Ashida, who embezzled approximately $2 million in public funds, and several cabinet members were also involved in the same collusion (Dentsu). Thus, this case, considered by Japanese newspapers to be the largest malpractice case in Japanese history, finally evolved into the general resignation of the Ashida Cabinet. After consulting with his master MacArthur on the afternoon of the 7th, Ashida convened a special cabinet meeting lasting fifteen minutes, deciding to end his seven-month cabinet life. Currently, MacArthur is searching for other loyal lackeys to form a cabinet.

　　政治腐败激起人民愤怒谴责
    日芦田内阁被迫辞职
    【新华社陕北十一日电】各方报导：日本人民与舆论对于因大官僚、大资本家在昭和电气公司贷款中受贿舞弊一案而暴露的政治腐败之愤怒与谴责，已迫使芦田内阁于七日午后辞职。前此芦田曾力图借麦克阿瑟的支持以渡过内阁危机。据塔斯社引日本报纸消息：芦田于五日内阁会议上宣称：麦克阿瑟总部的意见认为昭和案发展的情势（按系指国务大臣栗栖赳夫被捕），必须作为栗栖的“个人事件”解决。芦田也假惺惺地表示内阁对栗栖受贿案有“道义责任”，企图卸脱通同舞弊的罪责。据路透社透露：麦克阿瑟曾表示不赞同芦田内阁在本月中旬议会通过禁止公务员罢工及集体议价的法案以前辞职。可是，芦田的恋栈努力也罢，麦克阿瑟的帮忙也罢，已经抵挡不住人民的愤怒了；各工会团体展开了一个反对经济界、政治界高级人员大贪污的抗议运动（塔斯社）。全日递信工人工会中央罢工委员会、全日化学工业工人工会均参加这个运动。日本舆论界则尖锐地要求芦田内阁立即辞职。“东京新闻”、“朝日新闻”、“每日新闻”等纷纷谴责芦田对昭和丑案的推诿责任和恋栈。与此同时，前副首相社会党干事长西尾末广于六日以受贿与勒索罪名被捕。西尾供称：参加同一勾当的尚有日本银行总裁一万田尚登、盗用公款约两百万美元的首相芦田及内阁阁员数人（电通社）。这样，这一被日本报纸所认为的日本历史上最大的舞弊案，终于演变成了芦田内阁的总辞。芦田于七日午间晋谒其主子麦克阿瑟会商之后，召开了十五分钟的内阁特别会议，决定结束其七个月的内阁寿命。现麦克阿瑟正物色别的忠实走卒出来组阁。
