　　The People of Western Liaoning and Eastern Rehe
　　Enthusiastically Support the Jinzhou Campaign
　　Captured Enemy Officer Wang Shigao and Others Arrive in Harbin
    Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Front, 22nd—The masses in western Liaoning and eastern Rehe enthusiastically supported the liberation of Jinzhou. When the People's Liberation Army passed through the newly established Fuyi County (parts of Beipiao, Fuxin, and Yixian), local residents set up tea pavilions at the entrances of villages and along the streets to provide tea to the troops. Women along the supply lines not only prepared and delivered tea to the passing troops but also helped medical personnel care for the wounded day and night. Women in many villages voluntarily sewed and washed clothes for the soldiers and rushed to make military shoes. Young and middle-aged people actively participated in carrying stretchers, transporting the wounded, or serving as guides for the troops. In Jianping, Chaoyang and other counties, wherever the troops passed, large and small villages incessantly threshed grain and milled rice to rush the delivery of public grain. Groups of women and children drove livestock, carrying public grain on their backs, to designated locations for delivery. To facilitate the movement of troops, the masses in various places quickly repaired roads, and women also competed to participate. In four villages of Beifuyi County, more than 400 women participated in road repairs. In ten days, a certain sub-district repaired a total of 640 li of roads and newly built and repaired a total of ten bridges.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd—More than fifty officers (including fifteen family members) at the battalion level and above of the Kuomintang army's 20th Provisional Division of the 93rd Army, who were annihilated in the battle to liberate Yixian, have arrived in Harbin. Among them are Wang Shigao, commander of the division, Han Runzhen, deputy commander, Zhao Wenhou, director of the press office, Zhao Zhenhua, commander of the 1st regiment, Wang Canjing, commander of the 2nd regiment, and Chen Jingxi, commander of the 3rd regiment. It is reported that in addition to the 20th Provisional Division, the 93rd Army also included the 18th Provisional Division and the 22nd Provisional Division, both of which were also annihilated in Jinzhou. This army and the 60th Army, which revolted in Changchun, were both Yunnan armies.
