　　辛集 Industrial and Commercial Progress in the Last Half Year
    In the past six months, especially since May, Xinji's industrial and commercial sectors, along with labor union work, have achieved significant progress. This is due to the implementation of policies protecting and developing industry and commerce, and improvements in leadership.

    Since the land reform this spring, nearly 90% of Xinji's industrialists and businesspeople have been suspicious of our policies, especially those involved in both landlord/rich peasant activities and industrial/commercial operations. They dared not or were afraid to boldly operate their businesses. Coupled with the levying of industrial and commercial taxes, and a temporary sharp drop in prices leading to losses, the market once trended towards recession. Upon discovering this situation, the Municipal Party Committee, in February (Gregorian calendar), successively convened meetings of managers, symposiums for various industries, and merchant conferences. We explained in detail the Party's firm policy of protecting industry and commerce, as well as the specific measures for protecting industry and commerce promulgated by the Jizhong Administrative Office. This initially alleviated the ideological concerns of industrialists and businesspeople. Subsequently, resolving the issue of industrial and commercial households' burden of war support and returning confiscated goods further strengthened the confidence of the industrial and commercial sectors in expanding their operations. From then on, new shops like Zhixinghao and Xin Da Textile Factory actively repaired their storefronts in preparation for opening. Those who previously reduced their visibility by using their own names as brands also began to switch to formal business names. At the same time, the bank (Xinji Branch) corrected its bias towards small-scale business in its lending operations. It first established agreements with industrial households; 28 Hongpi factories, due to working capital difficulties, overdrafted more than ten million yuan, enabling them to continue operating normally. The Xizhang Leather Factory, facing closure, cleared most of its debts with this loan support. The whip trade, being a handicraft industry with fast turnover, had an even closer relationship with the bank. The sack factory, with a loan of twenty million yuan, expanded its scale and began to establish relations with general merchants. By April, a total of 54 new factories and workshops and 19 shops had been added, and the market was becoming increasingly prosperous. However, because most of the energy was initially devoted to land reform, and the bank's support for production through its operations was passive and lacked focus, and especially because the trade union only emphasized wages and neglected production and education in its leadership of labor movements, leading to abnormal worker work attitudes, the development of industry and commerce was limited to some extent.

    Correcting Labor Union Policies, Strengthening Industrial Leadership

    Since May, after receiving instructions from the District Party Committee to implement the Jizhong Industrial Conference, the Municipal Party Committee convened relevant departments (trade unions, industry and commerce bureaus, banks) to carefully review past leadership of industry and labor movements. They unanimously agreed that commercial leadership had been overemphasized, and there was a failure to recognize that workers are the basic force in building the city. Factories were only viewed in terms of their superficial scale, regardless of their internal management. The trade union did not delve into the work, being limited to the circle of the workers' cooperative. At the meeting, the Municipal Party Committee also decided to assign specific tasks to delve into specific factories in order to gain experience and guide the overall situation. Subsequently, with the Industry and Commerce Bureau as the main force, efforts were organized to conduct key industry (leather, iron and wood, textiles) investigations. Based on the spirit of the industrial conference and the local conditions, issues such as labor-capital relations, teacher-apprentice relations, loans, and housing were discussed and answered specifically through meetings of factory directors, managers, and worker representatives. The bank changed its thinking that releasing all deposits would stimulate price increases and generally increased overdraft amounts and focused on supporting the development of certain industries. The trade union convened symposiums and group meetings for managers and workers, first in public enterprises and then in private enterprises, explaining labor movement wage policies and labor policies, reviewing past shortcomings, and correcting biases at any time, and rectifying worker organizations. With such planned implementation of policies and the joint efforts of various departments, Xinji's industry and commerce achieved new development. (1) It relieved industrialists and businesspeople of ideological concerns about trade unions and labor movements, and they generally actively expanded their operations. The number of workers and shop assistants in various industries increased daily. Counting from February, a total of 165 new industrial households and 114 commercial businesses were added. (2) The worker organizations were improved, labor-capital and teacher-apprentice relations were initially improved, and a new work attitude was established. There are 2,655 workers in the city, and 2,129 of them are now members (previously there were 438), forming 52 factory trade unions. After ideological transformation, the porters changed their bad habits, democratically established labor discipline and a system of calculating work points and wages, and began to complete loading and unloading tasks on time and study newspapers in their spare time. Workers at Yonghua Chemical Company have gone from not going to work on time to automatically going to work early and striving to finish a hand's worth of work after get off work. Julong Iron Factory improved its operation and management, implemented a system of exchanging old tools for new ones, and carefully inspected finished products, overcoming many wasteful phenomena. With the change in work attitude, new creations emerged. For example, Wang Pin-yi, a worker at Wanju Leather Factory, researched the use of pyrite to replace mercury in tanning. Cheng Guodong, a worker at Yuhua Paper Factory, made toothpaste. Yonghua Chemical Company successfully trial-produced sulfuric acid and carbon rods. (3) It strengthened the unity of public and private sectors and drove the common development of the private sector. In the past, public enterprises mostly did not participate in trade associations, but now Xingmao Felt Workshop, Yonghe, Yongsheng and other textile factories have joined the industry association. The Municipal Promotion Agency purchased the finished products of 25 textile companies in the lean season, and helped Wuwu Sock Factory to recover its business.

    Neglecting the Policy of Benefit to Both Labor and Capital, Work Was Biased

    In this process, because some trade union cadres did not correctly grasp the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, some private factory managers unilaterally or deliberately misinterpreted the policy, resulting in a bias towards infringing on workers' welfare. For example, Wang Bingchun, the manager of Tongxinhao Whip Shop, abused workers. The trade union only mobilized workers to "protect industry and commerce" and "ask for less wages." As a result, they only gave 150,000 yuan for one million yuan. The workers settled the account because of the face of the trade union, and the manager was not punished in any way (it was later correctly resolved again, see page 1 of this newspaper on October 7th - Editor's note). In the case of the Sichengju Copper Basin Factory, workers went to the club to play for a while after finishing their work, and were scolded by the manager when they returned. In the labor-capital joint venture Haisheng Leather Factory, workers asked to report on business operations, and the manager said "it's none of your business." Also, because we one-sidedly reviewed the past wage struggles, some factory owners took the opportunity to simply suppress wages and reduce workers' living standards. Workers at Xingyuan Towel Factory automatically reduced their wages by a quarter, and the factory asked for further reductions, and reduced fine grains from one meal every ten days to not even one meal a month. Yuansheng Towel Factory forcibly reduced wages without the workers' consent, which affected the workers' low morale and sharply reduced output. The Municipal Party Committee has reviewed the root causes of these biases with the trade union and the Industry and Commerce Bureau and corrected them.

　　半年来的辛集工商业
    半年来，特别是五月以后，辛集工商业与工运工作，均获得显著的成绩；这是由于贯彻保护与发展工商业政策和改进领导的结果。
    自今春土改以来，辛集工商业者，几乎百分之九十以上都怀疑我们的政策，尤其是地主富农兼营的工商业，他们不敢或不敢大胆经营，又处于征收工商税，和物价一时暴跌不少买卖赔钱的情况，市面曾一度趋向萧条。市委发觉此种情况，于阳历二月间，连续召开了经理大会，各行业座谈会，及商人大会，详细的解释了我党坚决保护工商业的政策，及冀中行署颁布的保护工商业的具体办法之后，初步的解除了工商业的思想顾虑。接着解决了工商户负担战勤的问题，和退还了被斗争查封的货物更增强了工商界扩展营业的信心。从此致兴号、新大纺织工厂等新铺号，积极修理门面，准备开张，以前为缩小目标，以自己名子当牌号的，也开始改成正式字号。同时银行（辛集支行）纠正了经营放款业务上小商路线的偏向，首先与工业户订立了折子，红皮厂廿八家，因周转困难，透支一千万多元，得以照常经营；面临倒闭的锡章皮厂，在此贷款扶植下，清理了大部亏欠；皮鞭行，属手工业，活动快，与银行关系更密切；麻袋工厂，贷款两千万，扩大规模，并开始与一般商户建立来往。至四月份，共增工厂作坊五十四户，商铺十九家，市面日趋繁荣。但由于初期大部力量作土改，银行通过业务扶植生产，表现了被动和无重点，特别是职工会，对工运的领导，只偏重工资，忽视生产和教育，工人劳动态度不正常，这些又使工商业的发展，受到了一定程度的限制。
    端正工运方针　加强工业领导
    五月以来，市委接到区党委贯彻冀中工业会议的指示后，召集各有关部门（工会、工商局、银行业），认真的检查了过去对工业、工运的领导，一致认为偏重了商业领导，没有认识工人是建设城市的基本力量，对工厂只看表面规模，不管内部经营怎样；职工会不深入工作，限于职工合作社的圈子。会议上，市委也决定具体分工深入到一定工厂工作，以便吸取经验，指导全盘。随后以工商局为主，组织力量进行了重点工业（皮毛、铁木、纺织）调查，并将发现的劳资、师徒、贷款、房子等问题，根据工业会议的精神和本市情况，通过厂长、经理、工人代表会议，作了具体的讨论和解答。银行转变了认为将存款全部放出会刺激物价上涨的思想，普遍增订透支数，和有重点的扶植某种工业的发展。职工会由公营到私营先后召开了经理、工人座谈会、小组会，讲解了工运工资政策和劳动政策，检讨了以往的缺点，并随时纠正偏向，和整顿工人组织。在这样有计划的贯彻政策和各部门共同努力下，使辛集工商业获得新的发展。（一）解除了工商业者对工会及工运中的思想顾虑，普遍积极的扩大经营。各行业工人店员日益增加。从二月份算起共增工业一百六十五户，商业一百一十四户。（二）健全了职工组织，初步改善了劳资、师徒关系，树立着新的劳动态度。全市职工二千六百五十五人，会员已达二千一百二十九人（原有四百三十八人），共组成五十二个片（厂）工会；脚行工人，经过思想改造，转变了坏习气，民主规定了劳动纪律，和计工分资制度，并开始做到按时完成装卸车任务，和工余时间读报学习。永华化学公司工人，已由不按时上工到自动提前上工，下工也争取作完一手活。聚隆铁工厂，经营管理改进一步，实行了工具交旧领新，成品认真检查制度，克服了许多浪费现象。随着劳动态度的转变，出现了新的创造；如万聚皮厂工人王品一，研究出＠黄代替贡＠子制革。裕华纸厂工人程国栋制牙膏。永华化学公司试做硫酸、炭精棒，都先后成功。（三）加强了公私团结，带动私营共同发展。过去公营多不参加行会，现在兴贸毡坊、永和、永生等纺织工厂，都参加了行业联合会。市推进社在背月时间，收买了纺织业二十五家的成品，渡过了不利季节；并帮助五五织袜工厂复了业。
    忽视两利政策　工作出了偏向
    在这过程中，由于某些职工会干部没有正确掌握劳资两利政策，致某些私营工厂经理，片面或故意曲解政策，发生了侵犯工人福利偏向。如同心号鞭铺经理王丙春虐待工人，职工会只动员工人“保护工商业”，“少要工资”，结果一百万只给十五万，工人看着工会的面子算完了，经理没受到任何处罚（以后又重新正确解决，见本报十月七号一版——编者）。四成聚铜盆厂，工人作完活到俱乐部玩了一会，回去受了经理的斥责。劳资合营的海生皮厂，工人要求报告业务情况，经理说“干涉不着”。又由于我们片面检讨过去闹工资，某些厂主便趁势单纯压工资，降低工人生活。兴元毛巾厂工人自动减了四分之一的工资，厂方要求再减，并由十天一顿细粮减到一个月也没吃。元生毛巾工厂，不经工人同意，硬减了工资，影响工人情绪低落，产量锐减。这些偏向，市委已与职工会、工商局检讨了根源，予以纠正。
