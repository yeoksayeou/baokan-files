Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS reports: *Pravda*’s diplomatic observer, Isakov, published an article commenting on the Paris United Nations General Assembly. After mocking the absurd rumors frequently circulating in Washington, London, and Paris that the Soviet Union would withdraw from the United Nations, Isakov fiercely condemned Bevin's speech at the General Assembly. Isakov pointed out that the essence of Bevin's speech was slander and a rude rejection of the Soviet Union's peaceful proposals. Bevin's proposal is to abolish the United Nations and then establish new international institutions on the ruins of the United Nations, based on a completely different foundation – the foundation of regional blocs. This kind of institution would be a military alliance against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies; it would bring not peace but war to the world, and the United Nations has clearly become an obstacle to the expansion of their power. But the Soviet Union is standing up to defend the principles of the United Nations, to defend the United Nations Charter, and the Soviet Union's voice for peace is resounding on the podium of the United Nations. That is why the enemies of international cooperation and peace are dreaming of eliminating the United Nations. Facts have proven that the US-British bloc is harboring a broad anti-United Nations conspiracy.

  　斥美英破坏联合国
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社讯：真理报外交观察家伊萨科夫著文评论巴黎联合国大会。伊氏在嘲笑华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎经常流传的苏联将脱离联合国的荒谬谣言后，即痛斥贝文在联大的演说。伊氏指出：贝文演说的实质是诽谤和粗暴地拒绝苏联的和平建议。贝文的主张，就是要取消联合国，然后在联合国的废墟上，根据完全不同的基础——区域集团的基础，建立新的国际机构。这种机构将是反苏反人民民主国家的军事联盟；它带给世界的事不是和平而是战争，联合国显已成为扩张势力的障碍。但苏联正挺身保卫联合国的原则，保卫联合宪章，苏联保卫和平的呼声正在联合国讲台上响彻着。这就是为什么国际合作与和平的敌人，正在梦想消灭联合国。事实证明，美英集团正怀着一个反联合国的广泛阴谋。
