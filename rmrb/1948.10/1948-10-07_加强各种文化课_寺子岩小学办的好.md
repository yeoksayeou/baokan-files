　　Strengthening Various Cultural Courses
    Siyan Elementary School is Well-Run
    [Taihang News] Gao Xuebin, a teacher at Siyan Village (composed of seven natural small villages) Elementary School in the Eighth District of She County, has always been active in his work. After the teacher training this year, he clarified policies, understood the educational principles, and became even more proactive in his work. On the one hand, he publicized various policies and decrees of our Party to the masses. On the other hand, he strengthened various cultural courses in teaching, so that children could truly learn something of value for each day they spent in school. Students in slightly higher grades all had composition, diary, calligraphy, arithmetic draft, and problem answer books. In teaching, students in each grade were required to make a study plan every week. On Sundays, everyone checked each other and held mountain climbing competitions for each grade (a new way to compete in learning). Because of his meticulousness, patience in teaching, willingness to endure hardship, and proactive assistance in village work, the masses and cadres in the village supported him very much. After this summary, the parents of the children became more concerned about their children's learning. Gao Zhiming went to the school and said to the teacher, "I will entrust my family's ox-buyer (a thirteen-year-old fourth-grader) to you, and ask him to study hard. I can manage the family's livelihood by myself." Yang Youlin saw that other people's children had abacuses, but his own child did not, but also knew division, and he happily said, "Studying is like enduring hardship. It's not right if farming doesn't have tools." So he bought an abacus for his child. This year, the school has added seven newly purchased abacuses. Li Shuanggu said, "Now the school teachers don't beat or scold, and the children know a lot of characters. The new society is really better than the old society in every way. I must make my child study hard."

　　加强各种文化课
    寺子岩小学办的好
    【太行讯】涉县八区寺子岩村（七个自然小村组成）小学教员高学斌，一向工作积极。今年教员集训以后，明确了政策，了解了教育方针，工作更加主动。他一方面给群众宣传我党各种政策法令，一方面在教学上加强各种文化课，使儿童来念一天书，真正能学到一天的成绩。稍高的年级都有作文、日记、大楷、算术演草和问题答案本。教学上，每星期都要让各年级学生订出学习计划。星期日大家互相检查，和各年级来登山竞赛（比赛学习的新办法）。由于在教学上细致耐心，不怕吃苦，对村中工作又能主动帮助，所以村上群众和干部都很拥护他。这次总结以后，儿童家长对自己孩子们的学习更加关心。高之名找到学校对先生说：“我把咱买牛（十三岁的四年级生）交给你，叫他好好念书吧，咱家中的生活，光我自己就行了。”杨有林看到人家孩子都有算盘使，自己的孩子没有，但也会归除，他高兴的说：“念书和受苦一样，种地没有农具总不算常事。”便给孩子买了算盘。今年半年内该校共增加新买算盘七个，李双狗说：“现在学校先生不打又不骂，小孩们识字很多，真是新社会比旧社会什么也好。非叫俺孩子好好念个样子不行。”
