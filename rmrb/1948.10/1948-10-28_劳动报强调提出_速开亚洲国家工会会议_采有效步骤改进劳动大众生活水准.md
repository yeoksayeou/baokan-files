Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 25th: TASS reports: The Soviet trade union central organ newspaper, *Labor Daily*, recently, while analyzing the trade union movements in Asian countries, emphasized the necessity of rapidly convening an Asian national trade union conference. *Labor Daily* stated: National trade union organizations in Asian countries are increasingly frequently issuing such requests, namely, that the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) should take effective steps to improve the living standards of the working masses in Asian countries. The trade union organizations of these countries are awaiting concrete and timely assistance from the WFTU. There is no reason to further delay preparations for convening the Asian national trade union conference. To continue postponing it is to disregard the WFTU Charter. The Charter points out that one of the fundamental tasks of the WFTU is to organize the united struggle of trade unions of all countries against all infringements of the economic and social rights and democratic freedoms of the working masses. If the WFTU does not meet the fundamental requirements of the Charter, then the international working class, which established the WFTU to safeguard its rights and freedoms, will absolutely not allow it.

　　劳动报强调提出
  　速开亚洲国家工会会议
  　采有效步骤改进劳动大众生活水准
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联职工会中央机关报劳动报，顷在分析亚洲国家的职工运动时，强调提出迅速召开亚洲国家工会会议的必要。劳动报称：亚洲各国的全国性工会机构日益频繁地发出这样的要求，即世界工联应采取有效步骤以改进亚洲国家劳动大众的生活水准。这些国家的工会组织，正期待着世界工联的具体与及时的援助。再迟延筹备关于召开亚洲国家工会会议的工作，是没有任何理由了。再继续延期，就是不遵守世界工联宪章。宪章指出：组织各国工会对抗一切侵犯劳动大众经济和社会权利以及民主自由权利的联合斗争，是工联基本任务之一。如果世界工联不去满足宪章的基本要求，那么，为了保障其权利与自由而成立世界工联的国际工人阶级，是决不允许的。
