　　Laishui and Huailai Some Areas
  　Break with Old Customs and Implement Autumn Cultivation
    [Beiyue Electric] Comprehensive reports from Laishui, Liangxiang, Changwan, Laizhuo, Huailai and other counties indicate that the main focus of production in these counties and districts has shifted from autumn harvest to autumn cultivation. For example, Laishui widely convened cattle owner symposiums, appropriately resolved wage issues for draft cattle, properly arranged yokes, resolved rope shortages, and initiated a widespread upsurge in autumn cultivation. In order to complete autumn cultivation, the leadership emphasized that draft cattle wages should not be too high or too low, and that the interests of cattle owners should be taken into account, while also paying attention to the enthusiasm of landlords for autumn cultivation. It is advocated that both parties agree voluntarily. If a small number of people withdraw from the cultivated land in the future, whoever gets the land will pay the wages. If wages were not paid for autumn cultivation last year, whoever farms the land this year will pay the wages. In some parts of Liangxiang, even mules and donkeys that never used to plow land have been yoked together. Some villages have even organized manpower to pull the land. Currently, 121 mule, donkey, and cattle yokes have been established in the third and fifth districts. As of September 25th, 780 mu of land had been cultivated and 67 mu of land had been hoed. In Laizhuo, in addition to the livestock temporarily still being used to carry grain and corn, all animal power has been fully transferred to autumn cultivation. According to statistics from 21 villages in the first district and 16 villages in the second district alone, 259 yokes of livestock have been established, and more than 2,000 mu of land had been cultivated by September 28th. By the end of September, Yonghezhuang in the sixth district had cultivated 90 percent of the village's land. Even the areas of Nanshangen in the fourth district of Laishui and the first district of Huailai, which have never had the custom of autumn cultivation, have broken with convention this year. For example, in the past, the custom in the Nanshangen area of the first district of Huailai was that only black bean stalks and yam stalks would be plowed at best, and other land would not be plowed at all. This year, the leadership called for universal autumn cultivation. Village cadres and the masses raised many difficulties, some saying that autumn-cultivated land was afraid of being blown away by the wind, some saying that the land was too dry to plow, and some saying that there was no firewood to burn and that they had to cut firewood first after the autumn harvest. After explaining and publicizing the benefits of autumn cultivation, the masses' conservative thinking and habits were broken, and the proposal for universal autumn cultivation was realized. By September 27th, 154 sets of donkeys had been organized in eight villages, and 15 of them had started plowing on the 30th.

　　涞水怀来有些地方
  　打破旧习实行秋耕
    【北岳电】综合涞水、良乡、昌宛、涞涿、怀来等县报导，这些县区生产的主要内容已由秋收转到秋耕。如涞水普遍召开了牛主座谈会，适当解决了耕牛工资，插好了牛犋，解决了绳套的困难，掀起了普遍的秋耕热潮。为了完成秋耕，领导上着重指出耕牛工资不要过高，也不要过低，要照顾牛主的利益，也要注意地东秋耕的积极性。提倡双方自愿约定。耕过的地，将来如果有少数抽动谁得地谁拿出工钱。去秋耕地没给工钱的，今年谁种地谁给工钱。良乡有些地方在组织牛犋上，连向来不耕地的骡驴也已插起犋来，有的村还组织了人力拉地。现在三、五两个区的骡驴牛犋已插起百廿一犋。截至九月廿五日，已耕地七百八十亩，刨地六十七亩。在涞涿除了暂时还在驮谷驮棒子的牲口以外，所有畜力也已全部转入秋耕，仅据一区廿一个村二区十六个村的统计，已有二百五十九犋牲口插起犋来，在九月廿八日前就已耕地二千余亩了。九月底，六区永合庄已耕完全村土地的百分之九十。连向来没有秋耕习惯的涞水四区和怀来一区的南山根一带，今年也打破了成规。如怀来一区南山根一带，往年的习惯是顶好也只把黑豆楂、山药楂耕一耕，别的地就都不耕了。今年领导上号召普遍秋耕，村干群众提出很多困难，有的说秋耕地怕风刮了土，有的说地干耕不动，有的说没柴烧收了秋得先割柴。经过解释宣传秋耕的好处，才打破了群众的守旧思想和习惯，实现了普遍秋耕的主张。到九月二十七日，八个村组织起毛驴百五十四套，自三十日起，其中已有十五套开犁耕地了。
