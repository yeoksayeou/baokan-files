　　Daily Guidance for Our Cadres
　　*Pravda* Editorial, June 14, 1948, translated by Liu Shui

　　The success of anything is determined by people, by cadres. Our Party has paid and is paying great attention to cultivating and educating cadres who can solve all tasks. The Party sees this as one of the basic conditions for the victorious construction of Communism in our country. Experienced and knowledgeable staff do not fall from the sky. They grow and develop in the process of practical work. Comrade Stalin taught us that we must “pay close attention to the training of cadres, help each growing worker to advance, spare no time to patiently ‘deal’ with these workers, and promote their development.”

　　In the work of cultivating and educating cadres, the guidance of cadres occupies an important position. Now, when the composition of our Party's cadres has undergone great changes in recent years, the role of guiding cadres is even more important. In the organs of Party committees, many new staff members are participating in the leadership work of lower-level Party organizations. By no means all of these personnel have the necessary experience and organizational talent. These cadres need special care, daily assistance, and skilled guidance to help them quickly master the art of Bolshevik leadership—this is the direct and inalienable duty of Party organs.

　　The recently held district and state Party congresses pointed out that many Party organs have not given due attention to guiding cadres, considering this work to be secondary and of little significance. The meeting of the heads of organizational and guidance sections of the Party Central Committee's Party Organs Inspection Bureau, and of several republic Party central committees and directly subordinate state committees, also illustrated this point. For example, it was pointed out that the organizational and guidance section of the Party Central Committee of the Kazakh Republic did not discover the weaknesses in the guidance work of the state and district committees.

　　Guiding cadres is the most important part of leadership work. Experience shows that if nothing is done to correctly organize the implementation of resolutions, and the implementers of resolutions are not guided, even the correct resolutions of Party organs cannot be realized.

　　The Rameshekovsky District Committee of the Kalinin Oblast passed many resolutions. However, most of the resolutions were not implemented. The reason for this is that the district committee only focused on passing resolutions. Comrade Shevelev, the secretary of the district committee, preferred to replace suggestions and guidance to the staff with rude reprimands and bureaucratic management.

　　Or consider another fact. The Ol'ga District in the Mari Autonomous Republic was lagging behind in spring planting. The state committee promptly dispatched guiding staff (staff of the organizational and guidance section) to find out the reasons for the lag. They stayed in the district for only two days, then grasped a few things they understood and left. A few days later, the state committee's decision on carrying out mass political work in the district appeared in the republic's newspapers. The decision was made so hastily that when the state committee meeting was held, they "forgot" to invite the secretary of the Ol'ga District Committee to participate.

　　The state committee blindly believed in the power of resolutions and did not consider that it was necessary to guide the district committee staff on how to better organize the implementation of the resolutions. Therefore, unsurprisingly, after the resolution was passed, the situation of political work in the district did not improve at all.

　　Any textbook on organizational work states that after a resolution is passed, the focus of leadership work should be directly shifted to the place where the resolution is implemented, to the organizational work of cadres, to practical and earnest guidance of staff, and to checking the implementation. The Party committee should make the staff members who are tasked with implementing a certain resolution understand the significance of the resolution, understand the tasks given by the resolution, and have a full understanding of the deadline for completing the work. But this is only one aspect of the matter. It is not enough to just say what to do, it is also necessary to explain how to do it, and what better organizational forms should be chosen to achieve the current task. As early as 1934, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out in its "Resolution on Reconstructing the Methods of Basic and District Party Organizations" that guiding cadres should not be giving general reports at various meetings. It should be based on the analysis of several specific facts to show how to handle each different situation.

　　Guiding cadres means reminding each staff member of the methods and ways to solve this or that task, and pointing out the main and basic links they should grasp according to the specific conditions of each district, enterprise, collective farm, agricultural machinery station, and state farm. The same method cannot be used to solve this or that task. For example, the same method cannot be used to treat advanced collective farms and backward collective farms. Different conditions should be treated differently.

　　The Party organs should educate and guide cadres with correct working methods, and should not restrict the autonomy of subordinate staff in any case. On the contrary, the purpose of guiding work is precisely to enable staff members to express their autonomy and ability to find solutions, and to accurately consider the details of each thing entrusted to them. Guiding cadres means teaching cadres to treat everything with the interests of the Party and the state, to see the prospects in their work, and to be good at discovering unutilized possibilities and reserves.

　　Guiding cadres cannot be limited to giving suggestions and tips on how to start work. Cultivating cadres in living practical work should become the main thing in the activities of Party organs. The essence of the work of Party committee organizers lies in spending less time on meetings and drafting resolutions, and more on cultivating and educating cadres, and giving more practical help. For example, if the secretary of the district committee goes to a lower-level Party organization, he has the responsibility not only to point out the shortcomings that have been discovered to the Party members, and to point out the methods to overcome the shortcomings, but also to help them correct these shortcomings here.

　　All staff members of Party organs, and especially its leaders, have the mission of guiding cadres. However, in practice, it is often only seen that some guiding staff members are performing this work, and even so, they are not being correctly utilized in all places. For example, in many district committees in Kazakhstan, the guiding staff dispatched have become fixed special representatives for implementing production movements. In some places, it has even been decided to have the guiding staff live on collective farms, and to invite them to the district center only to attend meetings. Such facts can no longer be tolerated. The role and responsibility of the state and district organizational and guidance sections for guiding staff members and educating lower-level Party workers should be improved.

　　In order to truly educate our cadres in the art of Bolshevik leadership, the staff members of Party organs themselves should constantly improve their theoretical level and professional proficiency, and gain in-depth knowledge of state and district production.

　　We should remember Comrade Stalin's instruction: "In order to raise the Party's leadership to the proper height, we must first improve the working skills of Party workers."

　　Educating our cadres in the Bolshevik spirit and guiding our cadres daily are the most important conditions for the further development of our political and economic work.

### 日常指导我们的干部

　　日常指导我们的干部
    真理报一九四八年六月十四日社论·流水译
    任何事情的成功，都是由人，干部决定着的。我们的党对于培养和教育能够解决一切任务的干部方面，曾经而且正在予以很大的注意。党在这方面看到：这是在我国胜利地建设共产主义的基本条件之一。有经验的懂事情的工作人员，不是从天上掉下来的。他们是在实际工作过程中成长和养成的。斯大林同志教导我们说：必须“深切注意培养干部，帮助每个成长着的工作人员向前进步，不吝惜时间来耐心地与这些工作人员‘周旋’，并助长他们的发展”。
    在培养与教育干部工作中，指导干部占有重要的地位。现在，正当我们党内干部成份近年来发生很大变化的时候，指导干部的作用更加重要了。在党委员会机构中，有许多新的工作人员参加下层党组织的领导工作。在这些人员中远非全部都具有必要的经验和组织才干。这些干部需要特别的关怀，日常的帮助和熟练的指导，帮助他们迅速掌握波尔什维克领导的艺术——这是党机关直接的不容推卸的义务。
    不久前召开的区和州党代表会议，曾指出有许多党机关，没有予指导干部以应有的注意，认为这一工作是次要的很少意义的。联共中央委员会党机关检查局召开的，若干共和国党中委会及直属之州委会组织指导科科长会议，同样也说明了这点。例如，曾经指出过：卡查赫共和国党中央委员会组织指导科，没有发现州委与区党委指导工作的弱点。
    指导干部——这是领导工作的最重要的部分。经验表明：若果对于正确组织执行决议毫无所做，决议的执行者则不加指导，即使党机关的这种正确决议，也是不能实现的。
    加里宁州拉梅舍科夫斯基区党委，通过了许多决议。但是大多数决议都未被执行。其原因乃在于区党委只限于通过决议而已。区党委书记舍维列夫同志宁愿以粗鲁的叱责和官僚管理方式，来代替对工作人员的建议和指导。
    或另举这样一个事实。玛利自治共和国奥尔山区在春种中落后。州党委及时派遣了指导科员（组织指导科科员）去找出落后的原因。他们停留在该区仅两天，于是抓住几点了解的情况，便离开了。不几天，共和国各报出现了州委关于该区开展群众政治工作的决定。决定是这样匆促做好的，以至在召开州委会议的时候，“忘记”了请奥尔山区党委书记参加。
    州委会盲目地相信决议的力量，没有估计到必须指导区委工作人员，如何更好地组织决议的执行。因此不出所料，决议通过以后，该区政治工作的情况，丝毫没有改善。
    任何组织工作的教科入门书，都这样说：通过决议以后，领导工作的重心应当直接转到实行决议的地方，转到干部的组织工作，转到实际的恳切的指导工作人员，转到检查执行诸方面去。党委员会应当使得负有执行某项决议使命的工作人员，懂得决议的意义，了解决议所给予的任务，并对于工作应完成的期限，能有充分的了解。但是，这还仅是事情的一方面。光说要做还不够，还应当解释：如何做，为实现当前任务应选择什么较好的组织形式。联共（波）中央委员会早在一九三四年“关于重建基层及区党组织的方法”的决议中，就曾指出：指导干部不应当是在各种会议上作一般性质的报告。应当根据若干具体事实的分析来表明：在每一不同情况中应当如何办。
    指导干部——这就是说提醒每个工作人员以解决这个或那个任务的方式方法，并根据每个区、企业、集体农场、农业机器站及国营农场的具体条件，指出他们应当抓住的主要的基本的环节。解决这个或那个任务，不能以同一方法对待。例如在先进的集体农场和落后的集体农场便是。不同的条件，应有不同的对待方法。
    党的机关以正确的工作方式来教育与指导干部，在任何情况下都不应当束缚属下工作人员的自动性。相反，指导工作的目的，正是要使工作人员表现自己的自动性和找办法的才能，使他精确地考虑到委托他完成之每件事情的细节。指导干部——这就是教导干部以党和国家的利益，来对待任何事情，看到工作中的前途，善于发现未被利用的种种可能和后备力。
    不能把指导干部仅拘束于给予建议，提示如何着手工作而已。在活生生的实际工作中培养干部——这应当成为党机关活动中的主要的。党委员会组织者之工作的实质，也正是在于少付出时间去开会与拟制决议，而是更多从事于培养和教育干部，更多给予实际的帮助。譬如说，如果区党委书记到下面党组织去，他就有责任不仅是指示党员们以已发现的缺点，指示克服缺点的方法，而且在这里还要帮助他们改正这些缺点。
    党机构的一切工作人员，而首先是它的领导者，都负有指导干部的使命。然而在实际上时常只看到一些指导科员在执行这种工作，是的，即使这样也并非所有地方都正确地利用了他们。例如，在卡查赫斯坦的许多区党委中，派下去的指导科员，已变为实行生产运动的固定特派代表了。某个地方甚且还决定叫指导科员住在集体农场中，及把他请到区中心来只是参加会议。类似这些事实，是再不能听其自然的了。应当提高州和区组织指导科对指导科员和对下层党工作者教育的作用和责任心。
    为着实在地以波尔什维克领导艺术教育我们的干部，党机构的工作人员本身就应当不间断地提高自己的理论水平和业务的熟练程度，获得州和区生产的高深知识。
    应当记住斯大林同志的指示：“为要把党的领导提到应有的高度，首先就应当提高党工作者工作之熟练才能”。
    用波尔什维克精神教育我们的干部，日常的指导我们的干部——这是我们政治和经济工作进一步发展之最重要的条件。
