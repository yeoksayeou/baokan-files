	One Village Fires a Shot, Villages Respond
	A Record of the Hundred-Li Joint Defense in the Nanyang Border Area

From December of last year to January of this year, the Kuomintang bandit troops in Nanyang, southwestern Henan, were mostly defeated by our field army, and the remnants fled to the suburbs of Nanyang City, temporarily stabilizing the rural areas of the entire county. All cadres in Nanyang County then concentrated on mobilizing the masses. However, when our main force shifted in February, the bandit troops of Wang Tingfan, Zhai Hongfan, and others, after a month of regrouping, under the command of the Nanyang Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, returned and engaged in armed encroachment in the border areas, extending from Rizidian in the east to Sancha Kou in the west, causing chaotic conditions along a hundred-li line in the entire county. Village cadres, activists, and the masses suffered serious looting, killings, and the raping of women, making it impossible to sustain their lives. Therefore, the masses spontaneously rose up and demanded armed self-defense, universally proposing, "We can't survive unless we take up guns!" Based on this demand of the masses, the leadership clearly put forward the slogan "Shoulder knives and guns to protect our homes." The masses of nineteen administrative villages, under the leadership of village cadres and activists, began to stand guard day and night and started their struggle.

Although the masses in each village were organized under the call of "Shoulder knives and guns to protect our homes," they lacked close cooperation with the surrounding neighboring villages when attacked by the enemy, often falling into isolated village warfare. In March, land reform in the county was suspended, and the Nanyang County Committee of the Communist Party dispatched a group of cadres with military experience to personally lead the mass struggle in each district. In the struggle, according to the enemy's situation and terrain, several natural villages were formed into small combat groups, and several small combat groups were formed into joint defenses. Then, large joint defenses between the joint defenses were also organized. From the county and district joint defenses down to the villages, command posts at all levels were established from top to bottom, forming a unified combat command system. Village cadres, activists, and militiamen, under the slogan "Decentralized work, centralized fighting," also acted in a unified manner. The village head and deputy village head were the commander and deputy commander of a village, sleeping collectively with the militia at night and dispersing to work during the day. Whenever there was a situation, they would call the heads of each neighborhood and the militia to concentrate for combat. After the armed village governments and joint defenses were established in each village, whenever the enemy attacked, as long as one village fired a shot, the surrounding villages would respond, surrounding the enemy in the mountains and fields to fight a sparrow warfare. Once, when the bandit Wang Tingfan led two or three hundred men in an attempt to attack a certain place, they were bravely intercepted by the militia half a li away. More than three hundred militiamen from more than ten nearby villages, hearing the gunfire, rushed from all directions to encircle the bandits. After fierce fighting for half a day, the enemy was driven back, killing and wounding five bandits and capturing three alive. When the enemy's forces were too large, the armed village government and the militia would block the enemy on one hand and cover the safe transfer of the masses on the other. After many heroic struggles by the masses, nineteen strong combat fortresses (i.e., village governments) were erected along the hundred-li line from east to west, forming an arc-shaped encirclement and alert line against the Nanyang Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

In the course of the struggle, the leadership always paid attention to grasping every typical example and taking concrete measures to improve the fighting spirit of cadres and the masses. The wife and children of Liu Xizhang, the village head of Liaobo Village, Second District, were taken away by the bandits, and the bandits threatened Liu Xizhang to lead the militia to rebel. Liu thought that there were too many enemies to resist easily, so he cleverly said to the enemy, "There are too many of you, it is easy to expose the news, and if the Eighth Route Army knows, it will be terrible!" Later, the enemy sent a company commander, platoon leader, and squad leader to attempt to talk to him in secret. Who knew that Liu Xizhang had already devised a clever plan? When the bandits entered the house, they were captured alive by the militia. After hearing the news, the county government immediately held a mass meeting, put flowers on him, awarded him a flag, praised his exemplary achievements, and called on the masses to learn from him. Li Guangzhi, a militiaman from Nanhedian, First District, unfortunately sacrificed himself in a heroic battle with the bandits. The masses in the entire district held a public memorial service, and the county chief and district chief personally carried the coffin, offering condolences to his family with one and a half bolts of cloth, one hundred catties of rice, twenty-five catties of glutinous rice, and a sum of money. The land was cultivated by the village on his behalf. All militiamen and masses who were wounded in battle were treated by the People's Hospital of the county government. With the active support of the government, the masses were more determined in their struggle, proposing, "If the enemy pulls out one hair from our body, we will make him bald."

　　一村响枪·村村响应
    记南阳边缘区的百里联防
    去年十二月至今年一月，豫西南南阳国民党匪军，大部被我野战大军击溃，残余部分纷纷溃逃至南阳城郊，全县农村暂告安定。南阳县全体干部即集中进行发动群众工作。但当二月间我大军转移后，土匪王廷藩、翟鸿凡等部，经一月的重新纠合后，在南阳蒋匪绥署的指挥下，便又卷土重来，在边缘区进行武装蚕食，东至日店，西至三岔口，在全县一百余里的长线上，又呈混乱状态。村干部积极分子及群众遭受严重抢劫、残杀，妇女遭受奸淫，生活无法维持下去。于是群众自动起来要求武装自卫，普遍提出“不拿起枪来干，就不能活命了！”领导上根据群众这一要求，便明确提出“扛起刀枪保家乡”的口号。十九个行政村的群众，在村干和积极分子领导下，便实行昼夜站岗，开始斗争起来了。
    各村群众在“扛起刀枪保家乡”的号召下，虽然组织起来，但当遭受敌人袭击时，与周围邻村缺乏密切配合，往往陷于孤村作战。三月间，县里土改停止了，中共县委便抽调了一批有军事经验的干部，到各区亲自领导群众斗争，在斗争中根据敌情地形，将若干个自然村组成各个小的战斗集团，将数个小的战斗集团组成联防，然后联防与联防之间的大联防也随着组织了起来。从县、区联防一直到村，自上而下设立各级指挥部，普遍形成了统一的战斗指挥系统。村干部积极分子民兵在“分散工作集中打仗”的口号下，也都统一行动起来。正副村长即是一村的正副指挥，晚间与民兵集体睡觉，白天则分散工作。一有情况，就叫各闾长民兵集中起来进行战斗。各村武装村公所和联防建立起来后，每当敌人进攻时，只要一村打响，周围便村村响应，满山遍野围住敌人打麻雀战，某次当土匪王廷藩带领二三百人企图进攻某地时，在半里以外，便遭民兵英勇阻击，附近十余村民兵三百余人，闻枪声后，便从四面八方一齐涌来将匪团团包围，激战半天，把敌人打退了，毙伤匪五名，生俘三名。敌人兵力过大时，武装村公所和民兵即一面阻击敌人，一面掩护群众安全转移。经过群众多次英勇斗争，在东西一百余里的长线上，竖立起十九个坚强的战斗堡垒（即村公所），对南阳蒋匪筑起了一条弧形包围的警戒线。
    在斗争过程中，领导上时刻注意抓住每一典型事例，采取具体措施，提高干部与群众的斗争情绪，二区潦河波村村长刘希章的老婆和孩子被土匪拖了去，土匪并威胁刘希章带民兵叛变，刘想敌人太多不易抵抗，便机警的向敌人说：“你们人太多，容易暴露消息，叫八路军知道了，可了不得！”以后敌人便派了中队长排长班长三人，企图与他密谈，哪知刘希章早定妙计，当匪进屋之后，便被民兵活活擒住。县府闻息后，便立即召开群众大会，给他戴花，奖励旗子，表扬其模范功绩，号召群众学习。一区南河店民兵李光智在与匪英勇作战中，不幸牺牲，全区群众便召开大会进行公祭，县长区长亲自抬灵，抚恤其家庭布一匹半，大米一百斤，糯米二十五斤，并送给一批款子，田地由村中代耕。凡在战斗中负伤之民兵群众，都由县府人民医院负责医治。群众在政府的积极支持之下，斗争更加坚决，提出“敌人拔咱们一根汗毛，咱就叫他变成秃子”。
