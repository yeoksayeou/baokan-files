　　Multifaceted Organization of Mass Production
    Xiaoweiying Cooperative Increasingly Stronger
    [Taihang News] The Xiaoweiying Village Cooperative in the Second District of Qinyang was established in February of last year, raising a total of 810,000 yuan in shares. Most of the women in the village know how to spin and weave, but at that time there were no cotton carding machines or cotton gins in the village. The cotton for the spinners had to be taken to the west for carding and ginning, a round trip of ten kilometers, which was quite inconvenient. To solve this difficulty, the cooperative purchased a cotton carding machine and a cotton gin from Xingtai, which was very convenient for all the spinners.
    There are also some workers in the village who make slate pencils. When the slate pencils were sold quickly, they were sold in the village. When they were not selling quickly, the cooperative purchased them at the local market price (without paying cash) and transported them to Xingtai for sale. Saw blades were purchased from Xingtai and supplied to the workers. The workers' families' necessities were temporarily advanced by the cooperative, and accounts were settled later, which solved the difficulties of the masses.
    There are oil pressers and oil mill equipment in the village, so the cooperative tried to organize them to start production. When oil was selling quickly in Jincheng, they organized two animals to transport the oil for sale. On the one hand, it also supplied the needs of the masses in the village and the coal kilns, and solved the fertilizer difficulties of the masses, selling 21,100 jin of sesame cakes to the masses. Xiaoweiying is a mountain pass and the main road to Jincheng. Most of the coal from the mountains has to pass through this pass. The cooperative set up a coal yard and organized 50 villagers to transport coal, totaling 150,000 jin. Each jin earned 20 yuan in freight, for a total profit of 3 million yuan, averaging 60,000 yuan per person, which could buy two shi of wheat at the then prevailing grain price. In addition, it also helped the masses on the mountain sell 350,000 jin of coal, solving the coal burning difficulties of many villages.
    Xiaoweiying used to have a coal kiln, which was shut down during the Anti-Japanese War. Last winter, there was a coal shortage in the mountains, and the problem of coal burning for the masses could not be solved. The cooperative and village cadres, with the help of the government, organized the masses to mine coal, overcoming many difficulties. Once, the kiln was suddenly flooded, and the workers' morale was low. The cooperative and village cadres led the masses to bail out the water, and finally coal was mined, and the masses' morale was high.
    After the coal was produced, the Xiaoxin kiln also produced coal, which was of high quality and large quantity, so the coal from this village's kiln could not be sold. The kiln's difficulties could not be solved, and it was almost shut down. At this time, the cooperative tried its best to support it, supplying the kiln's necessities and solving the workers' families' difficulties, so that the kiln did not shut down under difficult conditions. In April, the Xiaoxin kiln produced very little coal, which was not enough, and the coal from Xiaoweiying began to sell. In a very short period of time, all the coal that had been stored for several months was sold out, making a profit of 42 million yuan. The cooperative not only recovered its debts, but also expanded its capital.
    In half a year, the cooperative organized the masses to mine and earned 42 million yuan, sold slate pencils and earned 9 million yuan, and transported coal and earned 3 million yuan, for a total of 54 million yuan. The village has 521 households with 1,873 people, and each person can earn an average of 28,800 yuan, which can buy one shi of wheat at the then prevailing grain price, and can solve the village's food shortage for three months. The cooperative's prestige among the masses has also gradually increased. The capital has increased to 13.12 million yuan, which is more than 16 times larger than before. The reasons for its development are also as follows: (1) Dividends are distributed on time and according to shares. (2) No time limit, no limit to the amount, and shares can be withdrawn at will. (3) Both physical objects and labor can be used as shares. (4) Able to correct deviations immediately after hearing the masses' feedback. At first, the cooperative stipulated that shares could not be withdrawn after half a month, but later, after hearing the masses' dissatisfaction, the cadres immediately admitted their mistake to the masses and changed it to allow shares to be withdrawn at any time. The masses felt that they were free, casual, and able to make money, so they scrambled to buy shares. Even the savings of women, old women, and children were invested in the cooperative. (5) In terms of credit, 1.24 million yuan was lent to help the masses buy 52 head of livestock, solve fertilizer problems, and organize spinning, weaving, transportation, etc. It has also played a significant role in supporting agricultural and sideline production. In addition, 340,000 yuan of floating capital was absorbed (3% interest was lent out, and 4% interest was absorbed). (6) The cooperative's rules and regulations are determined by democratic discussion. There are 11 people in the cooperative, and in addition to food, 20% of the profits are distributed. In the past, the dividends were distributed equally, but after everyone's discussion, it was changed to a graded treatment dividend system, which is divided into four grades according to labor and technology, with 50,000 yuan for the first grade, and 10,000 yuan less for each grade below. In this way, those who have labor and technology are all motivated. It was also decided to flexibly promote and demote: if anyone is not active in a certain period, their grade can be lowered after democratic discussion, and those who are active can be promoted. Everyone is working harder than the other.
    In the future development of the cooperative, it is necessary to further support and organize mass production, and improve the cooperative's various systems, such as credit, dividends, accounting, and meetings. In addition to holding regular meetings of cooperative members, it is best to organize a board of directors to regularly check and lead the work of the cooperative, so as to achieve greater consolidation and development.

　　多方面组织群众生产
    校尉营合作社日益壮大
    【太行讯】沁阳二区校尉营村社，是在去年二月成立的，共集股金八十一万元。该村妇女大部分都会纺织，但那时村中没有弹花机和轧花机，纺妇的棉花都要拿到西向去弹轧，往返二十里，颇感不便。社内为解决这困难，到邢台购回弹花机、轧花车各一架，所有纺妇都感到十分方便。
    该村还有一部分做石笔的工人。石笔快的时候，就在本村出售，不快的时候，该社按当地市价收买（不付现款），运往邢台推销。从邢台购回锯条供给工人使用。工人家庭的必需品，暂由合作社赊欠，等回来算帐，解决了群众的困难。
    本村有油匠，又有油房家具，该社就设法组织起来干开了。晋城油快，便组织两个牲口运油去推销。一方面也供给本村群众和煤窑上的必需，并解决群众肥料困难，卖给群众麻饼二万一千一百斤。校尉营是个山口，是通晋城的大道。山上的煤炭差不多都要由这口经过，该社便设一煤炭栈，组织本村五十人运输，共计运炭十五万斤，每斤赚脚洋二十元，共赚三百万元，平均每人获利六万元。按当时粮价可买小麦二石。另外还替山上群众推销三十五万斤，解决了好多村庄的烧煤困难。
    校尉营从前有煤窑，抗战中停顿了。去冬山下煤荒，群众烧煤问题无法解决，该社及村干即在政府帮助下，组织群众开采，克服了许多困难。有一次窑内突然涨水，工人群众情绪低落，合作社与村干部又领导群众把水绞干，最后打出煤来，群众情绪高涨。
    出煤以后，因为小新窑也出了煤，质量高数量也很大，顶得这村窑卖不出去。窑上困难无法解决，几乎就要停工。此时合作社尽量支持，供给窑上必需品，解决工人家庭困难，使窑在困难条件下没有停顿。四月间，小新窑煤出的很少了，不敷用，校尉营的煤就卖开了。很短期间，把几个月存下的煤都卖得一干二净，获利四千二百万元。合作社不但收回外欠，而且扩大了资金。
    半年当中，该社共组织群众开采获利四千二百万元，推销石笔获利九百万元，运输获利三百万元，合计五千四百万元，全村五百二十一户，一千八百七十三口人，每人可平均获利二万八千八百元，按当时粮价能买小麦一石，能解决全村三个月的食粮困难。合作社在群众中的威信，也逐步提高。资金增加到一千三百一十二万元，比原来扩大十六倍多。其发展的原因，还有以下几点：（一）按期分红，按股分红。（二）不限时间，不限多寡，抽入股自便。（三）无论实物劳力皆可入股。（四）听到群众反映能即时纠正偏向。起初社内规定，过期半月即不能入股，后来听到群众不满，干部马上向群众承认错误，改为抽入股不限时间。群众都觉得又自由，又随便，又能赚钱，争先入股。就是妇女老婆儿童的积蓄也都入到合作社里去。（五）在信用方面，共贷出洋一百二十四万元，帮助群众买牲口五十二头，解决肥料，组织纺织、运输等。对扶助农副业生产也起了不少作用。另外吸收游资三十四万元（贷出三分利，吸收四分利）。（六）社内制度由民主讨论规定。社内共十一人，除管吃外，赚钱后二八分红。以前分红是一律平等，后经大家讨论，改为等级待遇分红制，按劳力按技术分为四等，一等五万，以下逐级减少一万。这样，有劳力有技术的都积极起来。又决定灵活升降：那一期谁不积极，经过民主讨论降低其等级，积极者可以提高等级。大家一个比一个干的有劲。
    该社今后发展中，还须进一步扶植与组织群众生产，并健全社内各种制度，如赊帐、分红、会计、会议等。除定期召开社员大会外，最好组织董事会，以便经常检查领导合作社工作，以求得更加巩固与发展。
