Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Kuomintang army soldiers, forced to work for the Four Big Families, are abused and left to wander everywhere after being wounded, sick, or disabled. According to a disclosure in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao on August 18th, more than 70 retired soldiers who were wounded, sick, or disabled from the Soviet Northern Jiangsu and Southern Shandong battlefields arrived in Guangzhou via Shanghai on August 16th and were camping in Central Park. Most of them were from Guangxi and were soldiers of the Kuomintang army's 48th Division, including non-commissioned and junior officers who had served for up to twelve years. They wore tattered military uniforms, carried a backpack, and a worn-out military quilt. That afternoon, they went to the pseudo-Guangdong Provincial Government to request relief, but to no avail. When people in the park asked about their treatment and plans after retiring and returning to their hometowns, they were all infinitely saddened, and some even shed tears. They had not received any salary since retiring in April and had been begging for a living along the way. Furthermore, according to a Tianjin Ta Kung Pao Qinhuangdao dispatch on August 19th: At noon on August 12th, five soldiers who had been washed out of the Kuomintang army were complaining to passers-by on the streets of Qinhuangdao. They were all pale and emaciated, wearing dirty and ragged green military uniforms. One of them said that three of them were new recruits conscripted by the Yichang Garrison District, and two were active-duty soldiers. When they were driven out of Shanhaiguan due to weakness and illness, there were more than 30 of them, walking into the pass on foot. After arriving in Qinhuangdao, the military police said they were neither soldiers nor civilians and were not allowed to wander on the streets; they couldn't even beg for food. They were so hungry that they didn't even have the strength to walk and begged passers-by to help them get home.

　　国民党军伤病士兵无衣无食到处流浪
    【新华社陕北五日电】被迫为四大家族卖命的国民党军士兵，在伤病残废后备受虐待到处流浪。据八月十八日香港大公报披露：由苏北、鲁南战场因伤病残废而退伍的士兵七十余人，八月十六日由上海辗转到达广州，露宿中央公园。他们大部分为广西人，国民党军四十八师的士兵，有服役达十二年的中、下士班长。他们穿着残旧的军服，携带一个背包，一条破旧的军用棉被。当日下午他们跑到伪广东省府请求救济，毫无结果。游园的人问起他们的待遇和退役还乡后的打算时，他们都无限伤感，有的还掉下泪来。他们四月间退伍后一直未领过薪饷，沿途过着乞讨的生活。另据八月十九日天津大公报秦皇岛通讯：八月十二日晌午，秦皇岛街头有五个被国民党军队洗刷下来的士兵向行人诉苦。他们个个面黄饥瘦，穿着污垢破烂的绿军衣。其中一个人说，他们中的三个人是被宜昌团管区征来的新兵，两个是现役军人。他们在山海关因体弱及生病被撵出来时有三十余人，徒步入关。到秦皇岛后，宪兵说他们非军非民，不准在街上乱走，讨饭也讨不到。他们饿得连走路的力气也没有，哀求行人帮助他们回家。
