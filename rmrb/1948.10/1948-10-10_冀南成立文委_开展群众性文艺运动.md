　　Southern Hebei Establishes Cultural Committee
    Launches Mass Literary and Art Movement
    ★ In order to implement the guidelines and tasks of the North China Literary and Art Workers Conference and to launch a mass literary and art movement, the Southern Hebei District Party Committee decided to establish a Literary and Art Work Committee under the Propaganda Department, with Zhao Dingxin and Zhao Qiyang as secretaries, and Comrades Shen Shen, Shi Ping, and Xiao Su as members. On the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, under the personal guidance of Minister Xue, the first meeting of the Cultural Committee was held. It was determined that the task of the Cultural Committee is to promote and guide literary and art work in the entire district, with the direction of popularization, with the main purpose of launching a mass literary and art movement. Under the Cultural Committee, two groups, the Literary and Art Troupe and the Fine Arts Society, were established as practical organs for the work of the Cultural Committee. According to the current needs of Southern Hebei, it was decided that the current work of the Cultural Committee is mainly to train literary and art cadres, followed by promoting and improving creation. A half-year work plan has now been made from October this year to March next year. The Literary and Art Troupe will undergo internal rectification for the first three months (October to December) and tour for the next three months (January to March), organizing rural troupes. The Fine Arts Society will focus on running the Southern Hebei Pictorial and rush to produce New Year pictures to meet the needs of the masses for the New Year. At the same time, it is also planned to train another group of folk artists after the New Year in the solar calendar. This group will not only train storytellers, but also train magic lantern operators. In addition, in order to universally launch mass literary and art movements in various parts of the district in the future, all local committees have also been notified to select three to five cadres with relatively high literary and artistic cultivation to come to the Cultural Committee to study. After studying, they will return to the local committees to do literary and artistic work, so as to improve the spontaneous cultural and recreational activities of the masses in various counties in a guided manner.
