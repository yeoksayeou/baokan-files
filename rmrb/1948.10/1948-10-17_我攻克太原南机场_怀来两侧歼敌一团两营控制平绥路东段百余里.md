Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, 15th: The People's Liberation Army has continued to make significant progress in operations outside Taiyuan. On the 12th, the People's Liberation Army completely occupied the Wusu Airfield, 30 li south of the city, and the nearby strongholds of Senior High School, Malianying, and Chonggui, annihilating a portion of the enemy's 73rd Division. Prior to this, on the 9th, when the People's Liberation Army attacked the Beiying stronghold north of Wusu, it annihilated seven companies of the 18th Security Regiment and part of the machine gun unit. The People's Liberation Army on the north side of Taiyuan captured the important stronghold of Fenggeliang, 30 li northeast of the city, on the 13th, annihilating all the defending enemy troops. This location is only 20 li from the city's northern airfield. In the southeast of the city, the People's Liberation Army captured the key point of Shizuizi on the eastern mountains of Taiyuan on the 11th.

Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Sui Front, 15th: The People's Liberation Army along the Ping-Sui Railway has opened up two important gaps on both sides of Huailai, northwest of Beiping, annihilating an entire regiment, two entire battalions, and other enemy troops, controlling 150 li of the railway from Beiping to Zhangjiakou. This is an important victory for the People's Liberation Army operating in Chahar, following the capture of the three cities of Chongli, Shangyi, and Guyuan, and the annihilation of two regiments of Fu bandit's 31st Division northeast of Xuanhua. One unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated the important stations and strongholds of Shacheng and Taipingzhuang, west of Huailai, on the 9th, annihilating one battalion each of the Fu bandit's guard regiment and the 22nd Division of the 16th Army. On the 10th, they continued to capture important stations and strongholds east of Huailai, such as Chadao, Xibazi, Badaling, and Qinglongqiao, annihilating a portion of the Fu bandit's guard teams along the line. On the 12th, the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the entire 208th Regiment of the 94th Division of the 16th Army at Guojiabao, northeast of Kangzhuang. Two other regiments of the 94th Army were routed east of Chadao. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army reoccupied Shacheng and the strongholds of Xinbaoan and Tumu on the evening of the same day. Thus, the Fu bandit's lifeline, the Ping-Zhang section, has been cut into three sections by the People's Liberation Army, and Huailai and Kangzhuang have been isolated. The People's Liberation Army controls 150 li of the railway line from west of Huailai to Xinbaoan and from east of Chadao to Juyongguan. At the same time, another unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Yuhe County, the easternmost part of Suiyuan, and the strongholds of Gaomiaozi, Xinpingbao, and Xiyanghe in its southeast, annihilating a portion of the enemy.
