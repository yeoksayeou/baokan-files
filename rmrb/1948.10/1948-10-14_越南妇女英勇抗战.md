　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 10th: A letter from Tao Wanzhao (transliteration), a leading figure in the Vietnamese Democratic Women's movement, to the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, describes the heroic spirit of Vietnamese women in the resistance war, stating: "We have been fighting the colonial army for two years. During this period, two million people have died from hunger, disease, injury, and lack of medicine; we have no tanks, no airplanes, but if necessary, we are prepared to fight for another ten or fifteen years to win independence. Vietnamese women, along with the entire people, are fighting valiantly for freedom. Many of them serve in the People's Army, acting as signalers and scouts. Those women who cannot directly participate in the war are giving their armies all support: they deliver food to the front lines, and bring food and water to the soldiers in the rain of bullets. Women captured by the French colonial army are subjected to cruel torture. But the oppressors will never succeed in oppressing the Vietnamese people. The sympathy and support of all democratic people around the world is on our side, which increases our strength."

　　越南妇女英勇抗战
    【新华社陕北十日电】莫斯科讯：越南民主妇女领袖陶婉昭（译音）在致苏联妇女反法西斯委员会的信中，叙述越南妇女在抵抗战争中的英雄气概称：我们已和殖民军作战两年了。在这一时期中，有两百万人因饥饿、疾病、受伤和缺乏医药而死亡；我们没有坦克，没有飞机，但必要时我们准备再打十年、十五年来争取独立。越南妇女与整个人民一起，正在奋力为争取自由而战。她们许多在人民军中服役，充任信号兵与侦察员。那些不能直接参战的妇女，正在给她们的军队以一切支援：她们到火线上送食物，在弹雨中给战士们送饭送水。被法国殖民军俘掳的妇女则惨遭酷刑。但是刽子手对越南人民的压迫决不会成功。全世界一切民主人民的同情与支持是在我们方面，这增加了我们的力量。
