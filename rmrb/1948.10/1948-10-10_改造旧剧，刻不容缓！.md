Reforming Old Operas is Imperative!
    Liang Jun

    Old operas mainly refer to Peking Opera, but also include Hebei Bangzi, Shanxi Bangzi, Bengbeng, Dingxian Yangko, Shanxi Yangko, as well as Sizhu, Lao Diao Bangzi, Liu Zi Diao and other local operas. In North China, Peking Opera is the most widespread.

    According to very incomplete data, each district of Central Hebei, Taihang, and Southern Hebei has Peking Opera troupes under the leadership of cultural and educational organs. There are often seven or eight old theaters in Shijiazhuang City performing operas, with tens of thousands of audience members every day, and Peking Opera performances occupy a major position. In August, four or five Peking Opera groups jointly performed. Other towns and cities such as Xingtai, Yangquan, Xinqu, and Bozhen, as well as a few sub-districts or counties, also have semi-commercial old opera troupes that are frequently active. In addition to the new drama societies, individual troops also have old opera troupes that perform with the army. In addition, in the vast plains, and even in some larger market towns in the mountains, there are also amateur troupes of various old operas that do not separate from production. They are very active during temple fairs and the Spring Festival.

    These old operas have a wide audience and a great influence. The programs performed, except for a few that have been revised or newly compiled, are mostly not reformed. In these plays, especially in local operas, although some expose the evils of the ruling class and reflect some of the people's demands for democracy (such as "Anti-Xu Prefecture," "Four Jinshi," "Empress He Scolds the Court," etc.), the concepts are not very clear and have been distorted in many ways by the feudal ruling class. Therefore, most of the old operas, especially Peking Opera, propagate feudal superstitions everywhere through traditional concepts and inherited forms, praising the "merits" of emperors, advocating slave morality, and flaunting sensuality on the stage. All of this hinders the improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses and is a stubborn stronghold of feudal culture. Some district cadres reflected: When they went to the countryside to work and explain and oppose feudal superstitious ideas and the concept of fate, some backward masses, after watching old operas that make a fuss about gods and ghosts and promote karma, would greatly hinder our propaganda work.

    Many people also reflect that old operas are "too old" and "too feudal," and "watching old operas is not interesting"; but because new dramas that suit the tastes of the masses are not yet widespread, and new drama societies cannot often perform widely among the masses, when the masses cannot find suitable entertainment, they can only seek satisfaction from old operas. Therefore, they seek various opportunities, such as attending temple fairs, going to markets, making vows, thanking gods...etc., and pay high prices to invite opera troupes to perform a few old operas to watch. It is said that in the past one or two years, the village drama troupe in an individual village in Dingxian County changed to performing old operas under the support of the village cadres due to the influence of the prevailing trend of performing old operas. Some time ago, there was a phenomenon in individual villages in Pingshan where the masses raised money through the market to buy opera boxes and sing old operas on a large scale.

    Due to the tension of the war, and after the intense land reform movement, the vast number of farmers are now actively preparing for large-scale production next year, and their lives need appropriate cultural and recreational adjustments. This demand may be concentratedly expressed during the Spring Festival next year, and cultural and recreational activities will be very lively. But if we do not grasp it well, old operas will be particularly popular, and the toxins of feudal superstition will have a great opportunity to spread.

    In addition, the trend of cadres watching old operas is also very popular. This is also due to the lack of good new dramas that can meet their requirements.

    Therefore, the issue of reforming old operas and reviewing repertoires is really a problem related to the ideological education of the broad masses and the appreciation tastes of some cadres, and it is also an urgent problem to be solved in preparing to launch the mass cultural and artistic movement during the Spring Festival next year. This is a problem that deserves the deep attention of comrades working in various places and all drama workers.

    I think there are many ways to solve this problem. First of all, it should be emphasized that new dramas should be greatly developed, especially the dramas created by the masses themselves. They have a long history and have accumulated a lot of experience. These new dramas are popular with the broad masses and have the most promising future. After the land reform, the lives of the masses have greatly improved, and the situation in rural areas has undergone great changes. The development of mass cultural and artistic activities has had better conditions. During the Spring Festival next year, there should be many dramas that praise the new lives of the masses, and we must use great efforts to promote this work.

    Secondly, from the perspective of old operas themselves, the policy should be active reform. Banning performances can only limit the spread of the worst programs among the people, and widespread banning is inappropriate and impossible. Therefore, how to cooperate with old artists, select historical themes to write new dramas, or enrich and develop the progressive elements in old dramas, or create dramas that appropriately express realistic content based on the possible conditions of certain drama forms (such as local operas), so as to promote the new from all aspects and gradually eliminate the feudal content in old operas.

    This kind of old opera reform work cannot be successful in three or five days, and must be continuously worked hard for a long time to have good results. Now, the North China Peking Opera Research Institute, the Central Hebei Experimental Peking Opera Theatre, the Taihang Literary Federation, the Yi-Lu-Yu Literary Federation, and many rural drama troupes in various places have accumulated a lot of experience in uniting old artists to reform old operas. I urgently hope that the North China Drama and Music Work Committee can concentrate a certain number of cadres to study these experiences, determine the specific steps for reforming old operas, and carry out this arduous work with the greatest perseverance. It is best to encourage more drama workers to express their opinions in this regard, so that it can proceed smoothly and achieve greater results.

    Regarding the standards for banning old operas, the standards vary greatly from place to place. It is hoped that the North China People's Government can invite old opera experts to discuss and determine a unified standard, formulate a list of old opera programs that are banned and allowed to be performed, and issue them to all places for implementation, so as to avoid long-term confusion and make it impossible for lower-level cadres to grasp.

### 改造旧剧，刻不容缓！

　　改造旧剧，刻不容缓！
    梁骏
    旧剧主要指平剧，也包括河北梆子、山西梆子、蹦蹦、定县秧歌、山西秧歌，以及丝弦、老调梆子、柳字调等等地方戏剧。在华北，影响最普遍的要数平剧。
    根据很不完全的材料，冀中、太行、冀南各区都有文教机关领导下的平剧团；石家庄市经常有七八家旧戏院唱戏，每天有上万的观众，其中平剧的演出也是占主要地位。在八月间曾有四五个平剧团体联合演出。其他如邢台、阳泉、辛渠、泊镇等市镇以及少数分区或县，也有半营业性质的旧剧团经常活动。个别部队除新剧社外，并有旧剧团随军演出。此外，在广大平原上，甚至山地中某些较大的集镇上，也有不脱离生产的各种旧剧的子弟班，他们在赶庙会及春节时十分活跃。
    这些旧剧的观众甚广，影响很大。而演出的节目，除少数是经过修改或是新编者外，大部分是没有经过改造的。这些戏里面，特别在地方戏里面，虽然也有的是暴露了一些统治阶级的罪恶，反映了一些人民的民主要求（如“反徐州”、“四进士”、“贺后骂殿”等等），但在观念上还不太明确，并曾受到封建统治阶级多方面的歪曲，因此绝大部份的旧戏，特别是平剧，它们通过传统的观念与因袭的形式，歌颂帝王“功德”，提倡奴隶道德，在舞台卖弄风骚，到处传布封建迷信的毒素。这一切都在妨碍广大群众政治觉悟的提高，是封建文化顽固的阵地。有的区干部反映：他们下乡工作时宣传解释，反对封建迷信思想，反对命运观念，但一些落后的群众看了闹神闹鬼，提倡因果报应的旧戏以后，就会使我们的宣传工作受到很大阻碍。
    好些群众也反映旧戏“太老”、“太封建”，“看旧戏不带劲”；但由于适合群众口味的新戏剧还不够普遍，新的剧社还不可能经常在群众中广泛的进行演出，当群众找不到适当娱乐时，就只有从旧戏中去获得满足。因此，他们寻求各种机会，如赶庙会、赶集、还愿、酬神………等等，出高价请戏班子唱几台旧戏看看。听说定县个别村剧团在一、二年中曾因受演旧戏风气太盛的影响，在村干部的支持下，改演旧戏。在前些时候，平山还有个别村群众通过集市募款购买戏箱，大唱旧戏的现象发生。
    广大的农民由于战争的紧张，又经过紧张土改运动，现正积极准备明年进行大生产，生活里需要有适当的文化娱乐的调剂，这种要求可能在明年春节时集中的表现出来，文娱活动会搞的很热闹。但如不好好掌握，旧戏就会特别风行，封建迷信的毒素会得到大大散布的机会。
    此外，在干部中看旧戏的风气也很盛行。这也由于好的新剧缺乏，不能满足他们的要求。
    因此改造旧剧、审定剧目的问题，实在是有关广大群众思想教育与部分干部的欣赏趣味的问题，也是在准备开展明年春节群众文艺运动中急待解决的一个问题。这是值得各地工作同志及全体戏剧工作者深切注意的问题。
    我想解决这一问题的办法很多，首先应该强调指出的是要大大发展新的戏剧。特别是群众自己创造的戏剧。它们已有多年的历史，集蓄了不少经验。这些新的戏剧是为广大群众所喜闻乐见的，是最有光明前途的。在土改后，群众生活大大提高，农村情况有了很大的变化，发展群众文艺活动已有了较好的条件。在明年春节中，应该有许多歌颂群众新的生活的戏剧产生，我们要以极大力量去推动这一工作。
    其次，从旧剧本身说，应该是积极改造的方针。禁演只能限制一些最坏的节目在人民中散布毒素，普遍禁演是不合适的，也不可能的。因此，如何与旧艺人合作，选择历史题材编写新剧，或将旧剧中的进步因素，加以丰富发展，或者根据某些戏剧形式的可能条件（如地方戏）适当的创作表现现实内容的戏剧，这样才能从各方面推陈出新，逐渐把旧剧中的封建内容彻底肃清。
    这种旧剧改造工作不是三天五天可以成功的，必须长期不断努力，才能有好的效果。现在华北平剧研究院、冀中实验平剧院、太行文联、翼鲁豫文联，各地农村剧团中，已有不少团结旧艺人改造旧剧的经验，我迫切的希望华北戏剧音乐工作委员会能集中一定干部，研究这些经验，定出改造旧剧的具体步骤，以最大的毅力来进行这一艰巨工作。最好能推动更多的戏剧工作者来发表这方面的意见，使能很顺利的进行，获得更大的成绩。
    关于禁演旧戏的标准，各地很不一致。希望华北人民政府能邀请旧剧专家，商定统一的标准，制定禁演与准演的旧剧节目单，通令各地执行，以免长期混乱，下边干部无法掌握。
