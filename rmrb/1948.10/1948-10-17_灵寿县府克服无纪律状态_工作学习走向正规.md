[North Yue News] The Lingshou County government in the past had many shortcomings in its work and study. Some comrades were listless in their work and study, could return home at will when working in the countryside, and could fail to report their work after returning to the county. Even when reporting work, it was done casually. There was also no production labor to speak of. They either wandered around playing, chatted, or played cards for amusement, naturally hindering the improvement and strengthening of work efficiency.

Since the county affairs meeting was held, everyone unanimously proposed to oppose this tendency of being unorganized and undisciplined, and formulated methods to overcome it: It was decided that county affairs meetings and section meetings would be held regularly, to conduct reviews of work and study, and strengthen the reporting system. In addition to reporting on specific tasks, cadres going to the countryside would also report on their understanding and inspection of general work. Cadres returning home would establish a leave-taking system, adhere to work and study time, and formulate study plans. Sections would conduct collective study once every three days, with a test every half month, and review the advantages and disadvantages of learning. The leadership should take learning performance as one of the criteria for examining a cadre, and help the villages where they are located with the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Now the work and study of the county government has become regularized, and it can maintain two hours of study every day, and has recently implemented testing. In terms of production labor, all members of the county government, except for cadres going to the countryside and those who must stay at their desks, are helping military dependents and families of revolutionary martyrs in their villages with production. Although Section Chief Ma of the Finance Section is already 51 years old, he is pushing manure for the military dependents' wheat planting and does no less pushing than others. (Zhao Lei)

　　灵寿县府克服无纪律状态
  　工作学习走向正规
    【北岳讯】灵寿县府过去在工作学习上存在着不少缺点，有的同志工作学习疲疲塌塌，下乡工作时随意可以回家，回县后可以不报告工作，即是报告工作也是随随便便的扯一扯谈一谈；生产劳动也谈不到，不是转转玩，谈谈心，就是打扑克消遣，工作效率自然不能提高与加强。
    自县务会召开后，大家一致提出反对这种无组织无纪律的偏向，并订出克服的办法：决定县务会与科务会定期召开。做工作学习的检讨，加强汇报制度；干部下乡除负一定任务作汇报外，一般工作的了解与检查也做为汇报内容；干部回家订立请假制度，工作学习时间要坚持，订出学习计划。并以科为单位三天集体学习一次，半月测验一次，并检讨学习上的优缺点。领导上应把学习成绩做为审查一个干部的条件之一。并要帮助所在村的秋收秋种。现在县府工作学习已走向正规，能保持每日两小时进行学习，最近并实行测验。生产劳动上，全县府除下乡干部和座科必须留家外，其余十多个人一律帮助所在村的军干烈属生产；财政科马科长虽然已五十一岁了，但给军属种麦推粪都不少推。　　　（赵磊）
