Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 25th. Jin Sui is carrying out large-scale land reclamation, planting winter wheat, and plowing autumn land to lay the foundation for next year's large-scale production campaign. The land reclamation has now basically ended. According to preliminary statistics from Lin County, Li Shi, Zhong Yang, Fang Shan, Lan County, and Ping Lu six counties, a total of 72,280 mu of wasteland was reclaimed this summer. Other counties have generally exceeded their original plans. Zhong Paizi administrative village in Ping Lu County test-reclaimed 2,400 mu of wasteland last year, and this year's harvest exceeded other equivalent land by more than double, greatly stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for land reclamation. This summer, they expanded cooperative land reclamation, originally planning to reclaim 1,400 mu, but as a result, 4,500 mu were reclaimed. The wheat planting campaign is in full swing in various places. Lin County, Li Shi, Zhong Yang, Fang Shan, Xing County, Shen Mu, Shen Fu (newly established county, parts of the original Shen Mu and Fu Gu), and Lan County plan to plant 841,300 mu of wheat. Many of these areas have never grown winter wheat (such as Shen Mu and Shen Fu) or originally grew very little winter wheat (such as Fang Shan and Xing County) and are now greatly promoting trial planting or increased planting. Shen Mu, except for the northern desert areas where planting is impossible, has test-planted 50,000 mu in the south. Xing County strives for an average of three mu per household. In the Jin Nan counties, wheat production accounts for more than 70% of the total agricultural output, so planting winter wheat is particularly urgent. The Jin Sui Border Region Administrative Office specifically decided at a recent meeting of commissioners and county heads that in the Jin Nan area, wheat planting and autumn harvesting (as the climate there is warmer, and the autumn harvest is earlier) would be the central tasks in the next month. As for plowing autumn land, it has now partially begun. Xing County and other places plan to plow one-third of the land, and the Yan Bei counties plan to plow half to two-thirds of the land.

According to current experience, to complete these tasks, it is necessary to: 1. Determine land ownership; 2. Have enough plowing cattle; 3. Organize cooperative labor to solve the difficulty of manpower and animal power; 4. Prepare wheat seeds. Among these, determining land ownership is the most important. Because when land was distributed last winter and this spring, some farmers' already reclaimed or plowed land was taken back. This year, when land reclamation and plowing are being called for, many farmers are worried about changes in land ownership again. The measures taken by local governments in this regard are: 1. Farmers who have been allocated this reclaimed or plowed land must return labor or pay labor costs to the original owners; 2. The original owners of this reclaimed land still have the right to enjoy the tax exemption treatment stipulated in the Administrative Office's decree on rewarding land reclamation (that is, designating land equal to the original reclaimed land from the original reclaimers' existing land to be exempt from public grain), while the farmers who have been allocated this reclaimed land have no right to enjoy this treatment; 3. Issue land certificates to determine land ownership, and at the same time, widely publicize that labor leads to wealth.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 1st. Democratic governments at all levels in the Jin Sui Border Region issued large amounts of loans and seeds to help farmers solve the difficulties of wheat planting. According to statistics from the 11th Special Office of the area (under the jurisdiction of more than ten counties, including An Yi, Ping Lu, Wen Xi, Wan Quan, etc.) and 14 counties including Shen Mu, Shen Fu (newly established county), and Bao De, a total of 3.1 billion yuan in loans and seeds have been issued. The lending target of the 11th Special Office is mainly poor farmers in areas with greater difficulties. The loans will be repaid after the summer harvest next year and can be borrowed in whole and repaid in part. Shen Mu, Shen Fu, and other counties provide wheat seeds according to the actual needs of the borrower's wheat planting plan. Local industrial and commercial bureaus also plan to organize mule and horse fairs to facilitate farmers' purchases and exchanges. At the mule and horse fair in @ County, with more than 20,000 people, 215 cattle, donkeys, and other livestock and more than 380 dan of seeds were traded within five days. At the Lin County mule and horse fair, more than 720 head of various livestock were traded, which greatly solved the difficulty of animal power for farmers' autumn planting and autumn plowing.

　　晋绥确定地权后
    大量开荒种麦翻秋地
    政府发放大量贷款解决种麦困难
    【新华社晋绥二十五日电】晋绥各地大量开伏荒、种冬麦、翻秋地，以打下明年的大生产运动的基础。开伏荒现已基本上结束。据临县、离石、中阳、方山、岚县及平鲁六个县初步统计，今夏共开垦荒地七万二千二百八十亩，其他各县一般也都超过了原定计划。平鲁钟牌子行政村去年试开伏荒二千四百亩，今年收成较其他同等土地超过一倍，大大刺激了农民开荒情绪，今夏即扩大变工开荒，原计划开一千四百亩，结果开了四千五百亩。种麦运动，各地刻正热烈进行。临县、离石、中阳、方山、兴县、神木、神府（新设县、原神木、府谷各一部），岚县八个县计划种麦八十四万一千三百亩，其中许多从未种过冬麦（如神木、神府）或本来种冬麦很少的地区（如方山、兴县）今年都大大提倡试种或多种。神木除北部系沙漠地区无法种植外，南部已试种五万亩，兴县则争取平均每户种三亩。晋南各县麦产占全部农产百分之七十以上，种冬麦尤为急务。晋绥边区行署在最近召开的专员县长会议上特决定晋南地区在今后一月内以种麦及秋收（按该地气候较暖，秋收较早）为中心工作。至于翻秋地，现已部分开始，兴县等地并计划翻地耕三分之一，雁北各县更计划翻地一半到三分之二。
    根据目前经验，为完成这些任务，必须：一、确定地权；二、有足够耕牛；三、组织变工，解决人力畜力困难；四、准备麦种。其中确定地权最为重要，因去冬今春分配土地时，曾抽出某些农民业已开垦或翻过的土地，今年号召开荒翻地，许多农民顾虑地权再变。各地政府对此采取的办法是：一、分到此项开荒地或翻过地的农民须向原主还工或付工价；二、此等开荒地的原主仍有享受行署奖励开荒法令所规定的免征公粮的待遇（即在原开荒人现有土地中指定与其原开荒地相等之土地免征公粮），分到此等开荒地的农民则无权享受此等待遇；三、颁发土地证，确定地权，同时广泛宣传劳动致富。
    【新华社晋绥一日电】晋绥边区各地民主政府发放大量贷款、种子、帮助农民解决种麦困难。据该区十一专署（辖安邑、平陆、闻喜、万泉等十余县）及神木、神府（新设县）、保德等十四县统计，已发放贷款及种子共三十一亿元。十一专署贷款对象，主要为困难较大地区的贫苦农民。贷款于明年夏收后还清，并可整借零还。神木、神府等县，按贷户种麦计划实际需要贷给麦种。各地工商局并有计划的组织骡马大会，便利农民采购交换。＠县二万余人的骡马大会上，五天之内成交牛驴等牲畜二百十五头，种子三百八十余大石。临县骡马大会上成交各种牲畜七百二十余头，大大解决了农民秋种秋耕的畜力困难。
