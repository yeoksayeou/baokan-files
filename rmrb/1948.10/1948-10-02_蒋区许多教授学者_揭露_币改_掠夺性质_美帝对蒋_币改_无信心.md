　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. According to an August late Tianjin Ta Kung Pao report: many professors and scholars in Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanking have exposed the plundering nature of the Kuomintang reactionary government's "currency system reform" and predicted its inevitable failure. Peking University Professor Zheng Bobin said: this "new plan" does not show any reliable way to balance international payments. The exchange rate is lenient towards gold and dollar holders, but hits silver dollar holders. It cannot be combined with property tax by recovering gold and dollars; nor can it use differential treatment (that is, the exchange rate should be high for the rich and low for the general public), only sacrificing the small property owners, and still maintaining the interests of the wealthy families. Zheng said: This plan is actually nothing more than a change of units. Zhou Zuoren, a teacher at the Peking University School of Currency and Banking, analyzed it from economic, political, and military factors, predicting that the "new currency" would be just another new type of large banknote.
　　Nankai University Professor Ding Hongfan cited the successive currency reforms during the Greek and Chinese Northern Warlord periods as examples, believing that the Kuomintang government's "currency reform" would be difficult to be effective. He pointed out the greatly expanded nature of this "currency reform," saying: the current legal tender issuance may be ten trillion, which can be fully recovered with 300 to 400 million Gold Yuan notes, and the remaining 15 to 16 billion yuan is used to fill the one-year deficit.
　　Shanghai scholars and professors Wu Daye and others, in a Ta Kung Pao current affairs symposium, mentioned that the "Gold Yuan notes" issuance limit exceeded the current legal tender issuance by nine times, predicting that it would inevitably lead to inflation. It was also pointed out that this "currency reform" does not differentiate between the rich and the common people, and public educators and workers are particularly sacrificed.
　　Nanjing university professors Xu Zhizhong and over twenty others, discussed the various drawbacks of this "currency reform" at a symposium. For example, increasing tax rates and increasing the surplus income of "state-owned" enterprises will inevitably lead to price increases; and freezing the salaries of public educators and workers will greatly reduce social purchasing power. The professors also cited two examples of plunder: First, the gold, silver, and foreign currencies of the domestic people are immediately collected, while those deposited abroad are only registered and managed; Second, there is no difference in the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies for "Gold Yuan notes," which is actually to maintain the special interests of the privileged class.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. According to an Associated Press report from Washington on the 23rd, the US State Department issued a statement to the Senate, revealing that the United States has no confidence in the Kuomintang government's "currency system reform." It is reported that the State Department told the Senate: "The current situation in China does not have any basis for long-term currency stability"; and also said: "As long as large-scale deficits still exist, and the deficits are made up by increasing the money supply, inflation will continue no matter what currency unit is used." Note: This statement by the US State Department was in response to Senator McClellan's argument that the Kuomintang government should adopt a silver standard. McClellan is a member of the US Senate Appropriations Committee and the Congressional Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation. He recently stated at a mining conference held in San Francisco: "China's new gold yuan will fail," advocating that the Kuomintang currency be changed to a silver standard.

　　蒋区许多教授学者
    揭露“币改”掠夺性质
    美帝对蒋“币改”无信心　
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据八月下旬天津大公报报导：平、津、沪、宁许多教授学者都揭露国民党反动政府“币制改革”的掠夺性质，并预言其必将失败。北大教授郑伯彬说：这个“新方案”看不出有什么国际收支预算平衡的可靠办法。兑换率对黄金美钞持有者宽容，对银元持有者打击。既不能从收回金钞上与财产税配合而行；又不能用差别待遇（即兑换率应对富有者高，对一般平民低），只牺牲了小有产者，依然是维护豪门利益。郑氏说：这方案实际上也不外乎是单位的变换。北大货币银行学校授周作仁从经济、政治、军事因素分析，预示“新币”不过又是一种新的大钞。
    天津南开教授丁洪范举出希腊及中国北洋军阀时的历次币改为例，认为国民党政府这次“币改”难得有效。他指出这次“币改”大膨胀的本质说：目前法币发行额可能是一千万亿，以金园券三、四亿即可全部收回，其余的十五、六亿元是用来填一年的赤字的。
    上海学者教授吴大业等十余人在大公报时事座谈会中谈及“金园券”发行限额超过法币目前发行额九倍，预示必将引起通货膨胀。又指出：这次“币改”对豪富与平民无差别待遇，公教人员和职工阶级尤受牺牲。
    南京各大学教授徐致中等二十余人，在一次座谈会上谈及这次“币改”的种种弊端。例如提高税率及增加“国营”事业盈余费收入势必使物价上涨；而冻结公教人员及工人薪工却又大大减退了社会购买力。各教授并举出掠夺的两个例子：一、国内人民之金银外币立即收兑，而存放国外者仅予登记管理；二、以金银外币兑换“金园券”无差额，实为维持特权阶级的特殊利益。
    【新华社陕北卅日电】据美联社华盛顿二十三日电，美国务院曾向参院发表声明，透露出美国对于国民党政府这次“币制改革”毫无信心。据称：国务院曾告参院称：“中国的目前情势没有具备任何可使货币长期稳定的基础”；又称：“只要大规模的亏空仍然存在，而亏空又是用增加货币来弥补的，则无论使用何种货币单位，膨胀将继续不已。”按：美国国务院的这一声明，系回答参议员麦可伦主张国民党政府应采取银本位的论调者。麦可伦为美国参院拨款委员会及国会对外经济合作委员会的委员，他最近在旧金山举行的矿业会议上曾发表声明称：“中国的新金元将会失败”，主张将国民党货币改为银本位制。
