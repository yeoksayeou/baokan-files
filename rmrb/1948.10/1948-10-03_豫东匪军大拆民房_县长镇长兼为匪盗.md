Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. According to the Tianjin Dagongbao (L’Impartial) on the 5th, describing the tragic situation in Shangqiu, Xiayi, Ningling, Yucheng, and other counties in eastern Henan, which are occupied by the Kuomintang bandit troops: Chiang's troops are demolishing large numbers of people's houses in order to build city defense works. "There are no shops in the city anymore, and the population is also very small." As for the countryside, "Carts, carriages, food, and trees are being looted on the one hand, and also have to supply requisitions. Although it has not yet reached the point of utter desolation, in the Xiayi area, there are already many old people living by eating leaves." The Kuomintang county magistrates and town headmen either double as bandits, robbing the people, or are corrupt and pervert the law, wantonly conscripting; the so-called "militia" in eastern Henan has only about 5,000 soldiers, but extorts grain and money based on a quota of more than 20,000.

　　豫东匪军大拆民房  县长镇长兼为匪盗
    【新华社陕北一日电】据天津大公报五日讯所述国民党匪军所盘据的豫东商邱、夏邑、宁陵、虞城等县的惨状称：蒋军为了构筑城防工事，正在大量拆除人民房屋。“城里已经没有商店，人口也很少了。”至于乡间，“牛车、马车、食粮、树木，一方面遭受抢掠，同时又要供应摊派，虽然还没有到赤地千里的地步，夏邑一带，吃树叶过活的老百姓已经不少了。”国民党的县长、镇长们，或者兼为匪盗，抢劫人民，或者贪污枉法，滥肆征发；豫东的所谓“民团”兵员不过五千，却以二万余名额勒索粮款。
