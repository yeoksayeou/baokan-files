[Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] A certain unit of the First Army Corps of the North China People's Liberation Army is actively helping the local people with production. The troops stationed in a certain village helped 19 families of military martyrs cultivate 107 mu of land. The troops stationed in another village helped the people cultivate 30 mu of land. A heavy artillery company of a certain unit provided 20 animals to help the people cultivate 120 mu of land. The troops stationed in a certain village in District One helped the people grind more than 1,000 jin of public flour. The unit also plans to help the people reclaim 600 mu of wasteland. From late August to early September, according to statistics from ×× villages, the stationed troops provided a total of more than 1,870 labor days and more than 100 animal labor days to help the people, weeding and hoeing more than 2,900 mu of land, cultivating more than 1,500 mu of land, and grinding more than 10,000 jin of flour. After the troops stationed in a certain village helped the people weed more than 500 mu of land, the people were extremely grateful and insisted on inviting the troops to dinner and buying cigarettes to慰劳(show appreciation to). The unit politely declined. The people felt bad and finally sent 500 jin of vegetables. An old man in a certain village saw the stationed troops helping the people with production and said: "When the Gouzi army (referring to Yan Xishan's bandit army) was here, they tore down houses, beat people, robbed grain, and conscripted soldiers, ‘reporting voluntarily but ending up forced’; after the People's Liberation Army came, they weeded and hoed, cultivated land and repaired houses, helping the folks. The People's Liberation Army and the Gouzi army are really like heaven and earth."

　　晋中我军某部战隙助民收种
    【晋中电】华北解放军第一兵团某部积极帮助驻地群众生产。某村驻军帮助十九户军工烈属耕地一零七亩，另一村驻军帮助群众耕地三十亩，某部重炮连抽出牲口二十匹给群众耕地一二零亩。一区某村驻军帮助群众磨公面千余斤。该部并计划帮助群众消灭六百亩荒地。八月下旬至九月上旬，据××个村统计，驻军共帮助群众人力一八七零多个，畜力一百多个，挽蒿锄苗二千九百余亩，耕地一千五百余亩，磨面万余斤。某村驻军帮助群众锄苗五百余亩后，群众万分感激，定要请部队吃饭与买纸烟慰劳，该部婉言谢绝。群众过意不去，最后又送去五百斤蔬菜。某村一个老汉看到驻军帮助群众生产时说：“勾子军（指阎匪军）在时拆房打人，抢粮抓丁，‘自白转生’；解放军来了，挽蒿锄苗，耕地修房，帮助老乡，解放军和勾子军真是天上地下。”
