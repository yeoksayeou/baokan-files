　　County Secretary Personally Grasps Situation, Xiangyuan Smoothly Completes Wheat Planting

　　[Taihang News] Xiangyuan County basically completed wheat planting by the Mid-Autumn Festival. Only a few households in the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts were four or five days late, but were completed by the 20th day of the eighth lunar month. The primary issue in the county's wheat planting was resolving the cadres' muddled thinking about fearing party rectification. The party rectification in the experimental villages this spring had been biased, causing village cadres to feel low. Although the expanded cadre meeting in the sixth district had resolved part of the problem, they still dared not work boldly. This became the main problem in wheat planting leadership. This time, each district generally held expanded village cadre meetings of more than 300 people. The leadership reviewed the biases in this spring's experimental party rectification and made a special communication and study of the party rectification policy. This fundamentally resolved the village cadres' muddled thinking, and they all actively participated in the wheat planting leadership. Secondly, the masses had the idea of waiting for the right time for planting, thinking that early planting lacked stamina and whether or not there would be a harvest depended on fate. The leadership promoted the peasants' correct experience: "Early planting yields a harvest every year, late planting depends on luck." Farmer Ren Wenyu said: "When I planted wheat last year, my land was only separated by a road from Ren Tuhai's land. The grain yield was the same, but he planted five days earlier than me and harvested nine dou per mu; I planted five days later and only harvested two dou per mu, and most of it was moldy. I suffered from waiting for the right time." In the fifth district, Shangliang and Shuinian villages greatly benefited from experienced old farmers promoting early planting. The county leadership promoted collective leadership and division of labor. The county secretary personally grasped wheat planting and maintained contact with each district every two days (by telephone) and reported every ten days (in writing), promptly understanding and resolving problems. Each village integrated voluntary combination and democratic leadership into the cleaning up of weeding mutual aid wages, and reorganized the mutual aid organizations. This provided a strong organizational guarantee for wheat planting.

　　Because Xiangyuan's wheat yellow dwarf disease was severe this year, the leadership paid attention to the wheat problem from the beginning. Before wheat planting, the government printed and distributed the booklet "How to Prevent Wheat Diseases and Plant Wheat Well," which gave detailed instructions on the severity of wheat disease losses this summer, the causes of the disease, prevention methods, and how to implement them among the masses, and distributed them to various villages for the masses to study. The fifth district's Shangliang, Shuinian, and other villages first solved the masses' muddled thinking that wheat disease "is a matter of fate, not a seed problem." Shuinian and Shangliang villages alone adjusted and disinfected forty shi of wheat seeds.

　　In seed adjustment, the adjustment between households was initiated. The difficulties of the villages were adjusted through joint defense. In particular, the sixth district, because the disease was more severe, the county specially sent government section chief Liu to the sixth district to solve the problem and organized the first and seventh districts to adjust wheat seeds. Many problems were solved, and wheat planting was smoothly completed. (Wang Xian, Guangde, Lansheng)

　　县书亲自掌握情况  襄垣顺利完成种麦
    【太行讯】襄垣全县种麦工作，到中秋节已基本完成，只有四、五、六区少数户晚了四、五天，到阴历八月二十亦已种完。该县种麦中，首先是解决干部怕整党的糊涂观念。今春实验村整党曾发生偏向，使村干部情绪低落，虽经六日区村扩干会解决了一部，但仍不敢大胆工作。成为种麦领导中主要问题。这次各区普遍召开了三百余人的扩大村干会议，由领导上将今春实验整党中的偏向做了检讨，对整党政策又做了专门传达和研究。使村干部的糊涂思想基本解决，都积极参加了种麦领导。其次，群众对种麦存在有等节令思想，认为早种没后劲，收不收是天年。领导上发扬了农民的正确经验：“早种年年收，迟种碰年头”。农民任文玉说：“我去年种麦时，和任秃孩地只隔一道路，产粮都一样，人家比咱早种了五天，每亩收了九斗；咱迟了五天，每亩只收二斗，还是霉的多，吃了等节令亏啦。”五区上良、水碾通过有经验的老农宣传早种，作用很大。县领导上，发扬了集体领导，分工负责。县书亲自掌握种麦，和各区做到了两天一连系（电话），十天一汇报（书面），及时了解问题与解决问题。各村从清理锄苗互助工资中贯串自愿结合，民主领导，重新整顿了互助组织。使种麦有了有力的组织保证。
    由于今年襄垣小麦黄黑疸病害严重，一开始领导上就注意了麦子问题。政府于种麦前印发了“怎样防止小麦病害把麦种好”的小册子，对今夏麦病损失的严重情况，病害原因，防止办法，和如何贯彻到群众中去，作了比较详细的指示，分发各村，组织群众研究。五区上良、水碾等村，首先解决了群众对麦病认为“是天年过，不是种子问题”等糊涂思想。仅水碾、上良两村调剂消毒麦子四十石。
    在种子调剂上，发动了户与户的调剂。村的困难，以联防调剂。特别是六区，因病害较厉害，县里特派政府刘科长到六区解决，组织一、七区调剂麦子。解决了许多问题，使种麦顺利完成。（旺先、光德、兰生）
