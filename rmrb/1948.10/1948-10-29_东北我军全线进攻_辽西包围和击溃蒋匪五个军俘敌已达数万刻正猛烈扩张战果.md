　　Xinhua News Agency, Western Liaoning Front, Urgent Telegram, 1700 hours on the 27th: The five Chiang Kai-shek armies that advanced from Shenyang to western Liaoning have been completely surrounded and defeated by our forces. Our army has captured tens of thousands of enemy troops and is now vigorously expanding its victory. These five armies, namely the New 1st Army, New 3rd Army, New 6th Army, 71st Army, and 49th Army, were all equipped with American weaponry and commanded by Liao Yaoxiang. During the Jinzhou campaign, they advanced from Shenyang to the Xinmin, Zhangwu, and Xinlitun areas. With the capture of Jinzhou and the liberation of Changchun, the enemy had nowhere to run and massed in the Heishan, Beizhen, and Dahushan areas, attempting to escape. Our army swiftly redeployed the victorious troops from Jinzhou, turning back to encircle and annihilate them. Flying generals descended from the sky, making it impossible for the enemy to escape. Chiang Kai-shek still has the 52nd Army, 53rd Army, the Youth Army's Reorganized 207th Division (comprising three brigades), and various special forces and miscellaneous units in Shenyang, Tieling, Fushun, Benxi, Liaoyang, Xinmin, and Tai'an, with a portion occupying our Haicheng and Yingkou. Including Liao's army group, there are a total of 22 regular divisions, plus other units, totaling approximately 200,000 to 300,000 troops, representing the main force of Chiang Kai-shek in the Northeast. Liao's army group of five armies is the main force within that main force. From the 15th to the 25th, in the space of eleven days, the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek visited Shenyang three times, attempting to save Jinzhou, save Changchun, and save Liao's army group, and even decided on a so-called "general retreat," residing in Beiping, his eyes glued to the Northeast every day. He watched the loss of Jinzhou, he watched the loss of Changchun, and now he is watching the destruction of Liao's army group. In short, as a rule, wherever Chiang Kai-shek goes, it is the destruction of his despicable cause. Our entire Northeast People's Liberation Army is now launching a full-scale offensive to annihilate all of Chiang's troops.

　　东北我军全线进攻 　辽西包围和击溃蒋匪五个军俘敌已达数万刻正猛烈扩张战果
    【新华社辽西前线廿七日十七时急电】由沈阳进至辽西的蒋匪五个军，已全部被我包围和击溃。我军俘敌数万，现正猛烈扩张战果中。此五个军即新一军、新三军、新六军、七十一军、四十九军，全部美械装备，由廖耀湘统率，锦州作战时，即由沈阳进至新民、彰武、新立屯地区。锦州攻克，长春解放，该敌走头无路，全部猬集黑山、北镇、打虎山地区，企图逃跑。我军迅移锦州得胜之师，回头围歼，飞将军从天而降，使该敌逃跑也来不及。蒋匪尚有五十二军、五十三军、青年军整编二零七师（辖三个旅）及各特种部队、杂色部队，在沈阳、铁岭、抚顺、本溪、辽阳、新民、台安等处，一部占我海城、营口，连廖兵团在内，共有廿二个正规师，加上其他各部，共约二十万至三十万人，为蒋匪在东北的主力。廖兵团五个军，则为其主力中的主力。从十五日至廿五日十一天内，匪首蒋介石三至沈阳，救锦州，救长春，救廖兵团，并且决定了所谓“总退却”，自己住在北平，每天睁起眼睛向东北看着。他看着失锦州，他看着失长春，现在他又看着廖兵团覆灭。总之，一条规则，蒋介石到什么地方，就是他的可耻事业的灭亡。我东北人民解放军全军现正举行全线进攻，为歼灭全部蒋军而战。
