　　Soviet People Commemorate Stanislavski
　　The Soviet people commemorated the tenth anniversary of the death of the famous playwright and actor Stanislavski on August 7th. Stanislavski trained generations of Russian actors. Fifty years ago, he and another famous figure in the theater world, Danchenko, founded the Moscow Art Theatre, which was, in effect, the first realistic theater in Russia to be welcomed by audiences.
　　Moscow newspapers published editorials commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of the famous Russian playwright and actor Stanislavski. *Pravda* wrote: The creative vision of this great theatrical leader is guiding the Soviet theater world in its movement against the harmful influences of formalism and naturalism, and guiding the Soviet theater world along the broad road of socialist realism. The vitality of Stanislavski's creative vision lies in its organic combination with the fine traditions of Russian realistic art, and in its uncompromising struggle against every manifestation of bourgeois decadence in drama. *Pravda* concluded: Stanislavski dedicated his great and inspired talent to serving the people, and therefore we consider him a dear and admirable person. Stanislavski's creative ideals are now guiding the Soviet theater world in fulfilling the eternally noble new tasks assigned to it by the times.

　　苏联人民纪念史坦尼斯拉夫斯基
    苏联人民于八月七日纪念著名戏剧家及演员史坦尼斯拉夫斯基逝世十周年。史氏训练了好几代的俄罗斯演员。五十年前，他同另一位著名的剧界领导者段琴科创设了莫斯科艺术剧院，实际上，这是第一家在俄罗斯受观众欢迎的现实主义的剧院。
    莫斯科各报发表专论纪念俄罗斯著名戏剧家及演员史坦尼斯拉夫斯基逝世十周年。真理报写道：这位伟大戏剧领导者的创作见解正在指导苏联戏剧界反对形式主义与自然主义的有害影响之运动，并指导苏联戏剧界沿着社会主义的现实主义大路前进。史氏的创作见解之活力在于其与俄罗斯写实艺术之优秀传统的有机结合，并在于其对戏剧中每一点资产阶级颓废的表现都奋战而决不妥协的态度。真理报末称：史氏贡献其伟大而有灵感的天才为人民服务，因此我们认为他是一位可亲可贵的人。史氏的创作理想现正领导着苏联戏剧界尽其时代所赋与的永远高尚的新任务。
