　　Dutch Communist Party Organ Comments on Indonesian Events: Hatta Government's Reactionary Policy Accommodates U.S. Monopolists' Wishes
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. TASS, The Hague dispatch: The Dutch Communist Party organ "De Waarheid" commented on the Indonesian events, writing: The United States is trying to include Indonesia in its sphere of influence on the one hand, and to consolidate its position in the entire Southeast Asia on the other. To this end, the United States is attempting to isolate the democratic and anti-imperialist groups in the Indonesian Republic in order to seize Indonesia's raw material resources. In order to implement its plan, the United States is absorbing the support of the Masyumi Islamic Party and the Nationalist Party. The newspaper emphasized: The United States, by helping the bourgeois groups of these two parties, achieved the replacement of the People's Government of Sjahrir with the Hatta government; this allowed U.S. monopoly capital, supported by the Nationalist Party, to penetrate the economic life of the Indonesian Republic to some extent. Hatta's current policy is dedicated to opposing the struggle of the Communist Party and other left-wing groups to accommodate the wishes of U.S. monopolists; Sukiman, a capitalist representative of the Masyumi Party, is a running dog of the United States. Since taking over the post of Minister of the Interior, he has begun persecuting Indonesian democratic groups.

　　印尼人民军连克五城
    正扩大爪哇新地区的控制
    哈达军队进犯茉莉芬遭受极大抵抗
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社海牙九月二十八日报导：印尼共产党领导的人民军与哈达政府统率的反动武装之间的战事，在爪哇中部与东部正日益加剧。据荷兰报纸载称：“共产党军队正在扩大其对爪哇新地区的控制。”印尼通讯社承认：“共产党军队在爪哇又占领了五座城市”；茉莉芬东北七十公里的铁路城市新浦头已发生战事。据荷兰通讯社消息，茉莉芬以西的铁路城市瓦利库肯正进行激战。据合众社消息：哈达军队从西向茉莉芬的进攻，遭受极大的抵抗。美联社引革命政府电台广播称，茉莉芬西北地区，人民军俘敌一个师的一部。又据法新社引印尼通讯社称：人民军已占领梭罗以北约五十公里的帕乌达底城。哈达日前承认：“共产党在爪哇全境有许多据点，预料会有更多的骚乱，爪哇人已倾向共产党。”（美联社）哈达政府为着挽回其日趋不稳的统治，正继续大批逮捕进步团体人员。
    哈达政府的反动政策是适应美垄断家愿望　荷共机关报评印尼事件
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社海牙讯：荷共机关报“德·瓦尔海”报评论印尼事件时写道：美国一方面力图将印尼包括到它的势力范围里，另一方面想巩固它在整个东南亚的地位。为此目的，美国正企图孤立印尼共和国的民主和反帝团体，以便攫取印尼的原料资源。为了实施它的计划，美国正吸取马西乌米回教党与国民党的支持。该报着重指出：美国以援助该两党资产阶级集团的办法，达到将沙利佛丁的人民政府改换为哈达政府；这使为国民党所支持的美国垄断资本得以在某种程度上渗入印尼共和国的经济生活中。哈达现行政策是致力于反对共产党及其他左翼团体的斗争以适应美国垄断家的愿望；马西乌米党的代表、资本家苏基曼是美国的走狗，他自接任内政部长的职位时起，就开始迫害印尼的民主团体。
