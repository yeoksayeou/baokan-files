　　Mailbox: To Cao Pengfei:
	Liao Yunfu divorced his wife with government registration due to her physiological issues, both parties agreeing. Now that he has found a new partner and wants to remarry, the district village government is wrong not to approve it. Liao Yunfu should explain the truth to the district government. If it is still ineffective, he can appeal to the county government for resolution. Also, a Party member is allowed to marry the daughter of a landlord as long as both parties are willing. To Wang Huanzhang of Chengci County:
	Now that your county has begun rectification, you should immediately return without hesitation. All the issues you mentioned can be resolved during the rectification. To Liu Jingyu of Chiping:
	Your steamed bun shop on South Street in the city was not confiscated during the land reform and should now be returned or compensated. We have informed the Chiping County Committee to investigate and handle it. To Comrade Chen Zhong of the First Special District of Beiyue:
	The Industry and Commerce Bureau belongs to the government, so official letters and documents should be treated as official documents. It is incorrect for post offices in Yanggao, Datong, and other places to mistakenly consider them as enterprise departments and affix postage stamps to official documents as ordinary mail. The Beiyue Branch has been notified to correct this. To Ma Guangjun of Cixian County:
	Regarding the marriage you introduced that had a dispute due to procedural issues, it has been forwarded to the Civil Affairs Section and Judicial Section of the Cixian County Government for investigation and handling. To Xiang Yunrongzhen of Xingtang:
	Your letter is too brief to respond. To Liu Yousan of Weishui:
	After receiving your letter, we immediately sent someone to Weishui to investigate. Because the letter was not signed, we later found your father and brothers and learned your real name and work address. The situation you reported is generally true. Because it has become a thing of the past, there is no need to publicly publish it again. As for the issues left over from the land reform, the county and district are prepared to thoroughly resolve them in this rectification. In the future, if you have any opinions on the work, please continue to raise them and indicate your real name and contact address. To Wang Jintian of Zhifangtou Village, Ding County:
	Regarding the issue of your sister-in-law selling her child, it is difficult to respond due to the lack of comprehensive information. Therefore, it has been forwarded to the Ding County Civil Affairs Section for investigation and handling. To Hui Ge of Lingshou Normal School:
	Your suggestion to "increase the salary of normal school students" is very correct. This spirit was also mentioned at the recent North China Secondary Education Conference. The specific measures stipulated will be implemented immediately after being approved by the North China Government. To Xueping of Xingtai:
	The Wang Haifeng incident in Shiziyu Village, Xiyang County, involves a major criminal case involving human life and has been forwarded to the Xiyang County Committee for investigation and handling. To Comrade Liu Xueceng of Shijiazhuang:
	The issue of the long-term backlog of remittances at the Yixian Post Office mentioned in the letter has been requested to be checked and handled by the Yixian Post Office.
