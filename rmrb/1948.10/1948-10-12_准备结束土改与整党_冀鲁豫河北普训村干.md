    Preparing to Conclude Land Reform and Party Rectification
    The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Universally Trains Village Cadres
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] In order to universally carry out the work of concluding land reform and party rectification after the autumn harvest, the counties of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region are universally running training classes for village-level party member cadres and activists to cultivate key personnel. From the beginning of August to September 10th, incomplete statistics from just the ten counties including Zhuxian show that a total of 3,333 party members were trained. Some counties held up to three sessions, each lasting ten days to half a month. The content of the study included discussions of the victorious situation, how to rectify the party, correcting policies, standards for classifying class status, and basic knowledge for party members. Each county made additions and subtractions based on its specific situation. The study method often involved reflecting on and examining thoughts, and self-criticism, so that there was a correct understanding of party rectification. When studying policies and standards for classifying class status, analysis was carried out in connection with the actual situation in each village. The leadership also used typical examples to demonstrate and commend advanced individuals, so that the study gradually deepened. Most counties also conducted research and discussions on the current seasonal production, and after returning to their villages, they felt that they had a way to work. Through this training, the thinking of village cadres and party members has been significantly improved, and the vast majority have become active. In Shouzhang, 92.7% of the village cadres and party members who received training in the first session have become active. In Nanfeng, the second session had a total of 171 students. After the training, 17 cadres were promoted and detached from production in small areas, 28 cadres were semi-detached from production in small areas, and 124 people were active. There were also individual counties where the training results were not significant due to a lack of attention to the training classes, weak leadership cadres, or too few people. At present, in order to achieve greater results, all counties are continuing to run the classes.

　　准备结束土改与整党
    冀鲁豫河北普训村干
    【冀鲁豫电】为了秋后结束土改和整党工作的普遍开展，冀鲁豫河北各县普遍开办村级党员干部和积极分子训练班，培养骨干。自八月初至九月十日，仅筑先等十个县不完全统计，共训练党员三三三三人。多的办到三期，每期十天半月不等。学习内容，是座谈胜利形势，如何整党，端正政策，划阶级标准，党员基本知识等。各县均根据情况有所增减。学习方法，多是经过反省检查思想，自我批评，使对整党有了正确的了解。学习政策及划阶级标准时，均联系各村实际情况进行分析。领导上并以典型示范，表扬先进，使学习逐步深入。多数县份对当前季节生产也作了研究讨论，回村后均感觉工作有了门路。经这次训练，村干党员的思想已有显著提高，绝大部分已积极起来。寿张第一期受训村干党员，有百分之九十二点七已积极起来。南峰第二期共学员一百七十一名，受训后提拔脱离生产小区干部有十七名，半脱离生产小区干部二十八名，积极的一百二十四人。也有个别县份因对训练班不注意，领导干部弱或人数太少，训练成绩不大。现各县为收更大效果，均正继续开办中。
