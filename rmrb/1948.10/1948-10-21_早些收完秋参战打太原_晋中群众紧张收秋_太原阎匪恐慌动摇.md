　　[Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] The masses in Jinzhong are tensely harvesting, urgently requesting to fight Taiyuan. Zheng Jinquan, a militia member from Sunjiagang Village, Sixth District of Wutai, often asks the village cadres: "When will we attack Taiyuan? I am all prepared, and I can't wait to go to the front line to capture a few Yan bandit soldiers alive." A woman named Liu Fangman, hearing that the task of attacking Taiyuan is coming soon, stayed up all night making shoes, shirts, and cotton clothes for her man. Zheng Lingman, the women's director, stayed up all night sewing five rice bags for the laborers, and led women to harvest during the day. Village Chief Zheng Duheng personally led 24 farmers, 17 women, and 10 children who voluntarily participated in harvesting for the laborers. Within two days, they harvested 78 mu of grain and dug 52 mu of yams for the front-line laborers. Sun Si said: "Let's harvest well for the laborers, they are going to the front line to support Taiyuan." The wheat planting in Dongjiazhuang Village, Eleventh District of Shouyang, has been completed. The whole village formed seven groups with eighty people, harvesting 123.5 mu of grain in one day. The autumn harvest mood is very high. Everyone is eager to finish the autumn harvest early so that they can participate in the battle to take Taiyuan. (Wang Jirong, Wang Cunrong, Chen Tang)
　　[Jinzhong Frontline Electric Dispatch] Yin Jinhua, a lieutenant communication staff officer of the Yan bandit's Temporary 49th Division who recently fled from Taiyuan, said: After the People's Liberation Army captured Jinan, the Yan army in Taiyuan was extremely shocked by the PLA's powerful ability to attack fortified positions. Middle and lower-level cadres secretly discussed: If Jinan could not be defended, how could Taiyuan, without any external support, withstand the attack? They were afraid of being killed and preferred to be captured. Many people wrote letters to their families (in the newly liberated areas) telling them not to worry because they would be reunited after Taiyuan was liberated. In general, the Yan bandit officers defending the city have also lost confidence in the bunkers, believing that no matter how strong the bunkers are built, there will always be loopholes (gun holes, tunnels) through which the PLA's artillery shells can enter. Li Faqi, the deputy head of the 2nd Regiment of the Yan bandit's Temporary 49th Division, complained: We build fortifications every day, so many bunkers, even if every soldier had a bunker, it would be useless. The people in the isolated city of Taiyuan, who are forced to do hard labor and go hungry day and night, were extremely excited to hear the news of the liberation of Jinan, hoping that the PLA would quickly take Taiyuan and relieve their suffering as soon as possible. The senior Yan bandit officials are extremely panicked and wavering, and their families are scrambling to escape by plane in all directions. There are two "fasts" in Taiyuan: one is bean cake is selling fast, and the other is airplane tickets are selling fast. Under the Yan bandit's cruel looting, the vast majority of people can only rush to eat bean cakes, while the Yan bandit high-ranking officials and dignitaries are scrambling to hoard the wealth looted from the people of Jinzhong and board planes to escape.

　　早些收完秋参战打太原
  　晋中群众紧张收秋
  　太原阎匪恐慌动摇
    【晋中电】晋中群众紧张收秋，急切要求打太原。五台六区孙家岗村民兵郑金全，时常问村干部：“什么时候打太原？我的一切都准备好了，盼不得马上到前线去活捉几个阎匪军。”妇女刘方蛮听说打太原的任务快要来了，连夜给她男人赶做鞋、衫、棉衣裤等，妇女主任郑玲蛮连夜给民工缝米带五条，白天带领妇女收秋。村长郑都恒亲自带着自动参加给民工收割的农民廿四人、妇女十七人，儿童十人，两日内给支前民工割谷七十八亩、刨山药五十二亩。孙四说：“咱们好好的给民工收割吧，他们要到前线去支援太原哩。”寿阳十一区董家庄村种麦已经完成，全村结起七个组、八十人一天割谷一二三亩半，收秋情绪很高，大家都急着早些收完秋，好参战打太原。（王计荣、王存荣、臣唐）
    【晋中前线电】新从太原逃出的阎匪暂四十九师一个中尉通讯参谋尹锦华说：解放军打下济南后，太原阎军对解放军攻坚能力的强大极为震惊。中下级干部偷偷议论：济南都守不住，太原四面无援，还能顶得住吗？他们怕被打死，宁愿当了俘虏。许多人都向家里写信，叫家中（在新解放区者）不用挂念，不久解放太原以后还是能团圆的。一般守城的阎匪军官，对于碉堡，也丧失了信心，认为碉堡再修的硬，总要留窟窿（枪眼、地道），解放军的大炮炸弹都可进来。阎匪暂四十九师二团副团长李发基埋怨说：天天修工事，修这么多碉堡，就是把队伍每人都有一个碉堡也不中用。太原孤岛中被迫日夜饿着肚子作苦工的人民，听到济南解放的消息异常兴奋，希望解放军赶快拿下太原，早日解除他们的痛苦。阎匪高级官员则异常恐慌和动摇，他们的家属都抢着搭飞机四面逃跑了。太原市上有二快：一是豆饼快，二是飞机票快，广大人民在阎匪残酷抢掠下只有争先抢吃豆饼，而阎匪高官显贵则争先把抢掠晋中人民的财宝，拥上飞机逃跑。
