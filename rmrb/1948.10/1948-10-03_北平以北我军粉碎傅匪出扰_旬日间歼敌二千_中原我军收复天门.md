Xinhua News Agency, Pinggu Front, 1st. The People's Liberation Army in the area north of Beiping smashed the raiding attempts of the Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, annihilating over 2,400 enemies in ten days. Starting on the 14th of last month, the Fu bandits gathered two armies and raided in two routes, east and west. The enemy's Provisional 3rd Army on the west route, passing through Yanqing, Yongning, Heihe Ridge, and Si Hai Ye (the above three locations are all east of Yongning) via the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, raided Bao'ershou, northeast of Yongning. The enemy's 16th Army on the east route, passing through Shihai Institute and Boli Temple northwest of Huairou via the Ping-Gu Road, raided Tanghekou, west of Luanping in Rehe. The People's Liberation Army actively resisted the enemy head-on. On the 15th, one regiment of the enemy's Provisional 3rd Army launched several fierce attacks on one company of our army at Heihe Ridge. After a day of fierce fighting, they were all repelled by us, with over 400 enemies killed or wounded. Our army on the outer lines took the opportunity to attack the Ping-Gu Road, cutting off the enemy's transportation line between Shunyi and Huairou, and between Huairou and Miyun on the Ping-Gu Road. The enemy, caught in our internal and external attacks, fled back to the Ping-Sui and Ping-Gu roads in panic. They were again pursued and attacked by us along the way, suffering heavy casualties. In total, from the 14th of last month when the enemy raided, to the 25th when they collapsed and retreated, we killed or wounded 2,264 enemies, and captured 197 enemies. We seized one 60mm mortar, 13 light machine guns, 120 rifles and carbines, and 15 submachine guns.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 1st. A unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army recovered Tianmen County, about 100 kilometers west of Hankou, on the 25th, and the defending enemy fled. Another unit of our army eliminated a part of the Kuomintang Sui County Command Special Service Brigade at Huangjiazhai, belonging to Sui County, on the 16th, annihilating and capturing over 30 enemies, including the enemy company commander Deng Changyi. 17 rifles were seized.
