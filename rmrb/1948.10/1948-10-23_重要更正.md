　　Important Correction
    In the October 17th edition of this newspaper, the first page headline "North China Bureau Given Warning Punishment" had the word "Bureau" omitted in some newspapers. This should be corrected.
    On the October 22nd, fourth page, in the article "Righteousness Will Prevail Over Evil", the twelfth line from the end, "They should be imprisoned if they deserve imprisonment, executed if they deserve execution!..." should be corrected to "Whatever punishment they deserve, that's the punishment they should receive!..."

　　重要更正
    十月十七日本报第一版标题“华北局予警告处分”有一部分报纸将“局”字漏掉，应予补正。
    十月二十二日第四版“邪不压正”一文倒数第十二行“该着坐监就坐监，该着枪毙就枪毙！……”应改为“该着什么处分，就甚么处分！……”
