The Production Promotion Cooperatives in the Jizhong District

　　　　I. What role have the Production Promotion Cooperatives played?

The Jizhong District Production Promotion Cooperatives have achieved considerable success in the past six months. According to statistics from thirty-seven cooperatives, they have 80 branches, 1,778 cadres, and capital of 57,025,011,350 border currency units (including 3,720,000,000 yuan in agricultural loans). Firstly, in terms of agricultural loan disbursement: the production departments of the promotion cooperatives have between 15 and 20 cadres who go deep into the villages to disburse loans and organize the use of loans, so that most of the loans can be used for production. Statistics from 38 counties in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th sub-districts (as of the end of July) show that 2,477 old wells were repaired, 824 new wells were dug, 4,652 old waterwheels were repaired, 1,745 new waterwheels were purchased, 5,293 head of livestock were purchased, and 8,893,590,000 yuan of private funds and fruits of struggle were organized among the masses. Through loan work, 18,561 mutual aid groups with different content such as joint use of waterwheels, joint well digging, and joint livestock feeding were organized.

In terms of supply and marketing business, statistics from three to five counties show that 10,372,343,331 yuan of capital was used to organize supply and marketing business for mass production. Raoyang organized a mass-based weaving bag industry, which developed from 269 looms on March 20th to 408 looms in July, selling a total of 59,490 bags; Ding County supplied 16,283 jin of cotton and sold 51,557 bolts of homespun cloth in three months; various counties supplied large quantities of agricultural tools such as hoe blades, plowshares, and plow bottoms; statistics from 20 counties show that there are 22 iron factories (including waterwheel factories) and 14 woodworking factories manufacturing agricultural tools and handicraft tools. For example, the Naimeng Waterwheel Factory in Gaocheng produced 2,545 waterwheels in half a year, selling 2,365 of them. Two iron factories in Ding County repaired and fitted 2,138 waterwheel parts in three months. Widespread purchase of breeding livestock and organization of mating were carried out. According to statistics from 18 counties including Shenze and Hejian, a total of 6,362 matings were completed by the end of July. Shen County established a special livestock transfer command post to exchange currency for livestock vendors, supply goods, and organized 12 livestock transportation teams, transporting back more than 200 head of livestock.

　　　　II. Why were these achievements obtained?

The Promotion Cooperative closely integrates the three tasks of agricultural loan work, raw material and tool supply, product marketing, and organization of mass mutual aid and cooperation, and has a strong force for promoting production development. Agricultural loan work has achieved the combination of loan and production organization. For example, in Shen County, if the masses requested to buy waterwheels, they were introduced to the waterwheel factory to buy them; if they requested loans for spinning and weaving, they were introduced to the supply and marketing department to get cotton; if they requested loans for selling oil, they were introduced to the oil mill, and loans were granted according to the situation. Although not many have used this method yet, it points out a new direction - the combination of loans and supply and marketing business makes it easy to ensure that loans are used for production, and that loans are repaid in real terms. This method is much better than the simple method of assigning cadres at each level to guarantee and banks to handle procedures. From the perspective of supply and marketing business, it has considerable capital, and when combined with agricultural loans, it has the power to organize the production and supply of tools and raw materials necessary for mass agricultural and sideline production, and the marketing of local major products. Production and sales are linked together, overcoming the shortcomings of the past where state-owned stores could only find sales channels and profit adjustments, but could not directly organize mass production, so that state-owned trade enterprises have a solid lower-level reliance. For example, the Raoyang Promotion Cooperative investigated the needs of the masses, organized the masses to order goods, and since the end of July, the iron factory has supplied the masses with 1,190 new plows, 32 hoes, and 621 pieces of harrows (wood), straw cutters, etc., and repaired more than 500 old plows and 1,115 other agricultural tools.

Many county promotion cooperatives transport agricultural tools from the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company and lend or sell them to the masses, and organized many coal yards to supply fuel to the masses, saving a lot of firewood and oil cakes (sesame cakes, soybean cakes, peanut cakes, etc.) for fertilizer.

It has a group of cadres who directly go to the countryside to organize production through business and organize mutual aid and cooperation. This kind of cooperative enterprise directly organized from the mass production business can reduce or avoid administrative command formalism. Most of the directors of the promotion cooperatives are members of the county party committee and also heads of the government's construction department. They work under the unified intention of the local party and government, and the organization of forces is also easy to concentrate. Cadres of the construction department and cadres of the promotion cooperative often go to the countryside together. The entire strength of these dozens of professional cadres is to organize production and not be distracted by other tasks. This strong leadership of the Promotion Cooperative and the close integration with administrative work are also important factors in obtaining achievements.

　　　　III. Discussion of several issues

From the current materials, the Promotion Cooperative has considerable achievements, but there are also several issues that need to be discussed:

(1) Promoting the organization of mass mutual aid and cooperation and how to organize it: The entire business content of the Promotion Cooperative is to organize mass production. The large-scale development of the Promotion Cooperative's business must be supported by extensive mutual aid and cooperation. The restoration and development of rural production today must overcome the lack of labor, increase livestock, agricultural tools, and fertilizers. However, very few farmers can afford a head of livestock, dig a well, or buy a waterwheel. It is simply impossible to meet the needs of the masses by relying solely on the capital of the Promotion Cooperative. The only way to solve this problem is to organize. Some cadres of the Promotion Cooperative do not have a deep understanding of this point. For example, many comrades reflect that there is a shortage of funds. The eleven promotion cooperatives in the Ninth Sub-district requested loans of 7 billion yuan. In the business plan of a certain county, it is necessary to restore 80 oil mills, requiring 1 billion yuan of capital support. Of course, the shortage of funds is also a fact. If the strength of the masses can be organized (floating wealth in the fruits of struggle, accumulated labor, etc.), and the Promotion Cooperative only provides key support, then this difficulty will be reduced a lot, and even gradually overcome. For example, in the homespun cloth production area, it is generally felt that there is too much cloth and too little capital, and the turnover is not flexible, requiring state-owned stores to solve the problem, and some even complain to each other, leading to uncoordinated relationships. If it can be organized, with many village and community small cooperatives to support it, it will not be that a temporary slow sales or capital turnover will immediately cause the price of cloth to fall and the textile industry to be affected, or at least it can reduce this impact or shorten the time of impact.

How should the Promotion Cooperative organize mass mutual aid and cooperation? It must be organized through its business. For example, to increase the purchase of waterwheels, it is necessary to organize the landowners around several wells. This is not a general organization of ordinary mutual aid, and it cannot be that loans and supply and marketing are isolated without carrying out mass organizational work.

(Editor's note: Organizing the masses through loans can only be done when the masses are completely voluntary. Otherwise, it will become a formality, or other malpractices will occur, such as no one repairing the waterwheel when it is broken.)

(2) Establish the idea of long-term promotion of production, and the profit-seeking viewpoint and the patronage viewpoint must be liquidated. At present, a few promotion cooperatives still have some profit-seeking viewpoints, which are mainly reflected in the fact that the business still operates some businesses that are not urgently required by the masses. Such as the cigarette factory in Jin County, the shoe factory in Anguo, and the groceries in Xian County. Another thing worth liquidating is the patronage viewpoint. For example, many promotion cooperatives sell too cheaply or at cost price, or even at a loss. This kind of thinking is quite common among the cadres of the promotion cooperatives, so many promotion cooperatives lose a lot of money. For example, Boye lost 53,050 jin of millet. The Promotion Cooperative should concentrate its strength on operating the businesses that are most urgently required by the majority of the masses at present. Some promotion cooperatives operate bookstores and tobacco shops, although not for the purpose of making profits, but to serve the cultural and health undertakings of the masses, but under the existing conditions, in order to prevent cadres and capital from being dispersed, they should be transferred to private or institutional management, or postponed, and the organization of institutions and personnel should also be based on the spirit of simplification and avoid bureaucratization.

(3) This year, agricultural loan funds and supply and marketing business funds are used separately and accounted for separately. Many cooperatives advocate unified use, and the administrative office also agrees with this view. According to the experience of the past six months, unified use may be better: the close integration of agricultural loans and supply and marketing business can ensure that loans are used for production, the appropriate combination of purchase and loans can play a more practical role in driving private capital, and the problem of lending in real terms and ensuring principal can also be implemented, and capital can be saved and the efficiency of capital can be increased. However, the unified use of these two must be done under the conditions that the business direction is correct and the promotion cooperative itself has strong leadership, otherwise it will prevent loans from reaching the masses.

(4) Many promotion cooperatives and state-owned trade enterprises often have conflicts in the marketing of products (mainly homespun cloth and certain specialties). The basic crux of the problem is that the sales of these products are not smooth, or the sales are stagnant due to temporary capital turnover, inconvenient transportation, seasonal influences, etc. State-owned trade enterprises have not been able to actively explain this situation to the Promotion Cooperative and guide them to make appropriate arrangements for this situation. The Promotion Cooperative has a simple dependent viewpoint, allowing state-owned trade enterprises to adopt a large-scale contracting of production, thinking that whatever they need to sell, the store should accept unconditionally, and they do not have a sufficient understanding of the overall situation and blindly organize production. The solution proposed by the administrative office is that the trade company should actively devote itself to solving the sales problem, the Promotion Cooperative should pay attention to the rectification of the village and organize mass cooperative organizations of the market, and the Promotion Cooperative should do more to purchase homespun cloth. They should participate in meetings with each other, understand the situation, study business, and unify plans and division of labor. They should be mutually trustworthy in business. This method is basically correct, but a better typical experience has not yet appeared and still needs to be worked hard in the future.

　　冀中区的生产推进社
    　　　　一、生产推进社发挥了些什么作用？
    冀中区生产推进社，半年来取得不少成绩，据三十七个社的统计，拥有分社八○个，干部一七七八人，资金边币五七、○二五、○一一、三五○元（包括农贷三百七十二万万元），首先在农贷的发放方面：推进社的生产部都有十五至二十个不等的干部深入乡村发放贷款，组织贷款的使用，因之贷款大部能用到生产上。据八、九、十、十一分区三八个县的统计（截至七月底），修理旧井二、四七七眼，打新井八二四眼，修理旧水车四、六五二架，买新水车一、七四五架，购买牲口五、二九三头，组织群众私资及斗争果实八、八九三、五九○、○○○元，通过贷款工作组织群众伙使水车，伙凿井，伙喂牲口等不同内容的互助组一八、五六一组。
    在供销业务方面，三五个县统计，有一○、三七二、三四三、三三一元的资金，用在组织群众生产的供销业务上。饶阳组织群众性的织口袋业，由三月二十日的二六九架织机发展到七月份的四○八架，销出口袋计五九、四九○条；定县三个月供给棉花一六、二八三斤，推销土布五一、五五七匹；各县都供应了大批的锄板、铧子、犁镜等农具；二十个县统计，有制造农具及手工业工具的铁工厂二二个（水车厂包括在内），木工厂一四个。如藁城南孟水车工厂半年产出水车二、五四五架，销出二、三六五架，定县两个铁工厂三个月修理水车配置零件二、一三八件，普遍的购置种畜，组织交配，据深泽、河间等十八个县统计，截至七月底，共交配了六、三六二个，深县专设牲口调运指挥所，给贩牲口者兑换票子，供给货物，并组织了十二个牲口贩运小组，贩回牲口二○○多头。
    　　　　二、为什么会获得这些成绩？
    推进社是把农贷工作与原料工具供应，产品推销及组织群众互助合作的三套工作紧密结合起来，对推进生产的发展有雄厚的力量，农贷工作做到了贷款与组织生产相结合。如深县贷款即是群众要求买水车，就介绍到水车工厂去买，要求贷款纺织就介绍到供销部去拿棉花，贷款贩卖油的就介绍到油坊，根据情况贷给。运用这个办法的虽然还不多，但它是指出一个新的方向来——贷款和供销业务结合，使贷款用到生产上，贷款保本贷实还实都容易执行，比单纯的逐级分配干部保证，银行办手续的办法优良的多。从供销业务上来看，他拥有相当雄厚的资本，再和农贷结合起来，有力量举办群众农副业生产所必须之工具原料的生产与供应，及当地主要产品的推销，生产运销相互衔接，克服了以往公营商店只能找销路与利润调剂，不能直接组织群众生产的缺点，使国营的贸易企业有了牢固的下层依托。如饶阳推进社，调查群众需要，组织群众订货，自七月底，铁工厂供给群众新犁一、一九○个，锄耠三二个，耙盖（木）铡刀等六二一件，修理旧犁五○○多个，其他农具一、一一五件。
    许多县的推进社，都从正太煤铁公司贩运农具，贷给或卖给群众，组织了许多煤栈，供应群众燃料，省出许多柴火及油饼（麻饼、豆饼、花生饼等）用作肥料。
    他拥有一批干部直接下乡通过业务组织生产，组织互助合作，这样直接从群众的生产事业上组织起来的合作事业，可以减少或避免行政命令形式主义。大部分推进社的主任都是县委委员，又是政府的建设科长，他是在当地党政的统一意图下工作，力量的组织也易于集中，建设科干部和推进社的干部常是结合着下乡。这几十个专业干部的全部力量是进行组织生产，不被其他任务所牵扯。推进社的这种强有力的领导，和行政工作的密切结合，也是获得成绩的重要因素之一。
    　　　　三、几个问题的商榷
    从当前材料来看，推进社是有相当成绩的，但也有若干问题尚须商讨：
    （一）推进组织群众互助合作以及如何去组织的问题：推进社的全部业务内容是组织群众的生产，推进社业务的大量开展，必须有广泛的互助合作来支持，今天农村生产的恢复与发展须克服劳力不足、增添牲畜、农具、肥料。但是一个农户能买起一头牲口或凿起一眼井买起一辆水车的，为数极少，单纯靠推进社的资本要想满足群众的需要根本不可能，解决这一问题的出路只有组织起来的一途。有若干的推进社干部对这一点是了解不够深刻的，例如许多同志反映资金不足。九分区十一个推进社要求贷款七十亿，某县的业务计划中，要恢复八十个油坊，要求十亿元资本支持，当然资金不足也是事实，如果能把群众力量组织起来（斗争果实里的浮财，积蓄劳动力等），推进社只是重点支持，那么这个困难就会减少很多，以至逐渐克服。又如产土布区，普遍的感到布多资本小，周转不灵，要求公营商店解决问题，有的甚至因而与商店互相埋怨，闹到关系不协调。如果能组织起来，有很多的村社小型社支持，也不至于一时销路不畅或资本调转不过来，少收一点布，立刻就使布价下落，纺织业受到影响，至少是可以减少这种影响或缩短影响的时间。
    推进社如何去组织群众的互助合作呢？须是通过他的业务去组织，如增购水车，就须把水井周围几户的土地所有者组织起来，这不是泛泛的去组织一般的互助，同时他也不能是把贷款供销孤立起来，不去进行群众的组织工作。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （编者按：通过贷款去组织群众，只能是在群众完全自愿时进行。否则会成为形式，或发生其他弊害，如水车坏了没人修等。）
    （二）树立长期推进生产的思想，营利观点与恩赐观点，必须加以清算。目前少数推进社仍存在着某些营利观点，这主要表现在业务上还经营着若干非群众当前迫切要求的营业。如晋县的卷烟厂、安国的鞋厂、献县的杂货等。另一种值得清算的是恩赐观点，如许多推进社过于廉价或原价甚至折本推销。这种思想在推进社的干部中是相当普遍的，因之不少的推进社赔钱很多。如博野赔出小米五三、○五○斤。推进社应该是集中力量经营当前大多数群众最迫切要求的事业，某些推进社经营着的书店、叶铺，虽然不以营利为目的，是为群众的文化卫生事业服务，但在现有条件下，为使干部与资本不分散，应该转给私人办、机关办，或者缓办的，而机构组织人员配备上也须本精简的精神，避免机关化。
    （三）农贷资金与供销业务的资金，今年都是分别使用，分别立帐，很多社主张统一使用，行署也同意此种主张。据半年来的经验，统一使用可能较好：农贷和供销业务紧密的结合起来，可以保证贷款用到生产上，购买和贷款适当结合，对带动私资的作用更切实，而贷实保本问题也容易贯彻，并且可以节省资本，使资本发挥的效能增大。但是这二者的统一使用必须是在业务方向正确，推进社本身有强有力的领导的条件下才可以这样做，否则反会使贷款到不了群众手里。
    （四）不少的推进社与公营贸易企业在产品的推销上（主要是土布及某些特产）经常发生矛盾，其基本症结，是由于这些产品销路不畅，或者由于资本一时周转不灵、运输不便、季节影响等使销路停滞。公营贸易企业未能很好的主动向推进社说明这种情况，指示帮助他们对这种情况作适当处置。推进社存在着单纯的依赖观点，让公营贸易企业采取对生产品的大包干，自己需要卖什么，商店就应该无条件的接受，对整个情况了解不够，盲目的组织生产。这个问题行署提出的解决办法是贸易公司积极致力于解决销路问题，推进社注意整庄与组织群众性的合作组织市场，收购土布更多的由推进社去做，互相参加会议，了解情况，研究业务，统一计划与分工，业务上要互讲信用等。这办法基本上是正确的，但做的较好的典型经验还未出现，尚有待以后的努力。
