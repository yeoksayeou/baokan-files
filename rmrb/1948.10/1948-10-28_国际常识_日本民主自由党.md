  　Japan Democratic Liberal Party
    The Japan Democratic Liberal Party is composed of Japan's most reactionary big capitalists, landlords, and bureaucrats, representing the interests of Japanese monopoly capital and feudal groups. Its predecessor was the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party was officially established in November 1945, centered on the Hatoyama faction of the pre-war Seiyukai (mainly controlled by the Mitsui Zaibatsu), combined with other reactionary elements. When Japan held its first post-war general election in April 1946, it used large sums of money and shameless tactics such as threats, enticements, deception, and bribery to win 148 seats in the House of Representatives, becoming the largest party in the parliament. Its leader, Shigeru Yoshida, also took the stage for the first time in May of the same year to form a cabinet. At that time, the Liberal Party's policy was to be a loyal lackey of American imperialism, maintain the reactionary emperor system, implement inflation, and promote black market transactions. When Japan held its second general election last April, the Liberal Party's seats in the House of Representatives fell to 133. In the winter of the same year, the Democratic Party split due to differences of opinion on the coal mine nationalization bill, and a group of party members led by Kijuro Shidehara broke away from the Democratic Party. After they left the party, they joined the Liberal Party in jointly preparing to form a new conservative party. By March of this year, the Democratic Liberal Party, centered on the Liberal Party, emerged. It has a total of 151 seats in the House of Representatives, occupying the position of the largest party in the parliament. At the party conference that opened on the 9th of this month, the party openly proposed in its 19-article platform to fully support MacArthur's indicated revisions to the Civil Service Law and "eradicate" progressive ideas in order to ingratiate itself with its American master.

  　日本民主自由党
    日本民主自由党，是由日本最反动的大资本家、大地主与官僚组成的，代表日本垄断资本与封建集团的利益。它的前身是自由党。自由党是以战前政友会（主要为三井财阀所支配）的鸠山派为中心，结合其他反动分子，于一九四五年十一月正式成立的。当一九四六年四月日本战后第一次大选时，它运用大笔经费及威胁、利诱、欺骗、笼络等无耻手腕，在众院中获得一百四十八席，成为议会第一大党。该党党魁吉田茂，也就在同年五月首次登台组阁。当时，自由党的政策，是甘充美帝国主义的忠实走狗，维持反动的天皇制，实行通货膨胀，助长黑市交易。去年四月日本举行第二次大选时，自由党在众院的议席降至一百三十三席。同年冬，民主党内部因对煤矿国营法案意见不同发生分裂，以币原喜重郎为首的一部分党员脱离了民主党。他们脱党后，便与自由党一道共同筹组新的保守党。到今年三月，便出现了以自由党为中心的民主自由党。它在众院的议席共一百五十一席，占议会第一大党的地位。在本月九日开幕的该党会议上，该党所提的十九条政纲中，更明目张胆地提出全力支持麦克阿瑟所示意的修改公务员法和“根除”进步思潮，以取媚其美国主子。（新华社）
