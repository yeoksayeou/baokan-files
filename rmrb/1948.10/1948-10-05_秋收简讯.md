　　Autumn Harvest Briefs
    △ In Jin-Sui region, a tense autumn harvest campaign is underway. To avoid frost and wind damage, local Party committees and democratic governments have called on farmers to harvest quickly. In nineteen villages including Piancen Village in Huairen County, men and women, old and young, are all in the fields. The oat harvest is complete, and they are now harvesting millet and digging potatoes. The masses are also organizing various mutual aid teams to first help poor military families, revolutionary martyr families, and workers' families with the autumn harvest. Cadres in Hequ County are discussing the organization of helping labor with poor military families, revolutionary martyr families, and workers' families, and are visiting households one by one to check on the progress of the autumn harvest. Wuzhai County is paying attention to the autumn harvest for the civilian laborers participating in the war, ensuring that both autumn harvest and military service are not delayed. Women in Baijia and other places in Lin County are freely forming mutual aid groups, entrusting children to one or two people to care for at home, while the majority are投入 into the autumn harvest campaign.
    △ Party, government, and military personnel in the Ji-Cha-Re-Liao region are enthusiastically helping the masses with the autumn harvest. The directly affiliated organs of the Central Bureau have decided that all personnel, except for those who are physically weak or ill, will participate. The directly affiliated organs of the Jidong District Party Committee have already helped the masses harvest more than 750 mu of crops. The organs of the Northern Pingnan Sub-district Commissioner's Office helped the masses harvest more than 4,000 mu of sorghum and millet in five days. The Re-Liao Sub-district Party Committee, Commissioner's Office, and other organs are not only sending personnel to participate, but also dispatching carts and public horses to help the masses transport the autumn harvest home.
    △ Various organs and troops in the Yu-Xi Liberated Area have organized autumn harvest teams to help farmers with the autumn harvest. The directly subordinate teams of the Yu-Xi Military Region put forward the slogan "Helping with the autumn harvest is supporting the front line." All cadres, soldiers, and support staff enthusiastically participated. On September 13th alone, they harvested 114 mu of soybeans and corn. A certain regiment of the Field Army helped the masses harvest 241 mu of millet in twelve days, as well as doing more than 300 workdays of miscellaneous tasks such as cutting straw, carrying manure, and picking cotton, and carrying more than 9,700 loads of water. Jia Tianfu, a villager in Daying Village, Shifeng County, felt grateful for the help that Zhang Jinming, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, had given him. Unable to repay him, he wrote a notice detailing the facts and posted it at the street corner, which read: "My family has four people. My legs hurt and I can't work. My son is disabled and can't do any work. No one takes care of the odd jobs at home. Comrade Zhang Jinming from the Third Squad lives in my house and helps me cut millet spikes, carry water, and chop firewood. This comrade has helped me a lot, without bothering me for food or lodging. I feel very bad about it, so I am issuing this notice to express my appreciation."
