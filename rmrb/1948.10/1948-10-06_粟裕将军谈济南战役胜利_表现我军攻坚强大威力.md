Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th. Our reporter today interviewed General Su Yu, Deputy Commander of the East China Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the commander of the Jinan Campaign, and asked about the reasons for the victory of the Jinan Campaign. General Su Yu replied:

	"The victory of liberating Jinan should first of all be attributed to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The strategic thinking and strategic guidance of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee enabled us to smash the enemy's key offensive against Shandong, and enabled our army to turn to the offensive, finally creating the victorious situation of liberating Jinan and liberating the entire Shandong. Second, it was due to the close combination of the military and civilians in various strategic areas and the fraternal corps, which contained a large number of enemies, making it impossible for the enemy to quickly reinforce Jinan. In particular, the vast number of military and civilians in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu areas directly cooperated in combat and fully supported the front line, making great contributions to this campaign. Third, it was due to the correct leadership of the East China Central Bureau of the CPC and the East China Military Region, as well as the support of the East China Party, government, and military organizations and the broad masses of the people. Local corps actively cooperated in combat, destroyed railway transportation, and annihilated and contained the enemy; the people everywhere worked day and night to build roads and bridges for our army, transport grain, ammunition, and wounded soldiers; all of these helped create the victory in Jinan. Fourth, after our army's new-style consolidation, there has been great progress in all aspects. Commanders and fighters have improved their class consciousness and have a strong fighting will, are able to unite and cooperate, obey commands, fight heroically, and are not afraid of sacrifice, especially the ability to attack fortified positions has improved significantly. Therefore, shortly after the Suiqi and Yanzhou campaigns, our army was able to undertake the task of liberating Jinan and carry out a highly unified and concentrated offensive and annihilation war by large corps. Fifth, it was due to sufficient campaign preparation work. After the Suiqi campaign, our army universally carried out commendation and celebration of merits, elected people's heroes and model heroes, and carried out the revolutionary heroism movement. We conducted reviews from top to bottom and summarized campaign experiences from bottom to top, learned offensive tactics, reformed prisoners of war, educated new soldiers, and prepared reserve forces. The entire army conducted war situation studies and implemented the 'three checks and three rectifications.' The party committee system at all levels was established and improved, and soldiers' committees were universally established. Education was conducted on confiscating and turning over spoils of war, military democracy, and urban policies. Logistics work such as supply, sanitation, military stations, and transportation were organized. A series of tasks such as wartime political work, propaganda mobilization, joining the Party on the front lines, reorganizing on the front lines, evaluating merits on the front lines, political offensives on the front lines, campaign reports, and ideological guidance were all studied in advance and thoroughly conveyed and deployed, so that every commander and fighter understood the operational intentions and how to fight for the liberation of Jinan and the annihilation of the enemy, and were ideologically, politically, organizationally, and materially prepared for large-scale continuous and arduous combat. The actual effect of these preparations was most evident in the campaign. And these can only be unique to the People's Liberation Army, and are fundamentally impossible for Chiang Kai-shek and all counter-revolutionary armies to do."

	Regarding the military significance of the Jinan Campaign, General Su Yu said: "The liberation of Jinan concentratedly demonstrated the unparalleled strength of the People's Liberation Army, especially its powerful ability to attack fortified positions. Jinan is located north of the Yellow River and south of Mount Tai, with a strategically important terrain, easy to defend and difficult to attack. During the Japanese occupation, solid defense works had already been built; after the Changhe liberation, Wang Yaowu supervised his subordinates to intensify repairs day and night. More than a thousand steel-reinforced concrete bunkers were scattered throughout the surrounding hundred li, as well as countless minefields, countless electric fences, stone walls, deer villages, and trenches, guarded by more than 100,000 heavily armed troops; however, under the attack of the People's Liberation Army, after only eight days and nights of fierce fighting, they were crushed. This proves that any defense by Chiang Kai-shek cannot stop the offensive of the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Liberation Army can capture any firmly defended large city. The People's Liberation Army can not only annihilate a large number of enemies in a very short time in mobile warfare, but also annihilate a large number of enemies in a very short time in offensive warfare. In the Jinan Campaign alone, the number of enemies annihilated was more than the total number of enemies annihilated in all battlefields across the country in a month at the beginning of the war. In August and September last year, Wang Yaowu was complacent and said something like 'The Shandong Communists have been eliminated'; but after just over a year, today it is not the 'Communists' who have been eliminated in Shandong; but hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang troops, including Wang Yaowu himself. All of these show that our army is getting stronger and stronger, and the enemy is getting weaker and weaker, and the balance of power between the enemy and us and the impact of the war have undergone and will continue to undergo fundamental changes. The Kuomintang reactionaries are increasingly moving towards final failure, and we are increasingly moving towards national victory. But at the same time, we must remember: although our victory this time is very great, Chiang Kai-shek, under the command of US imperialism, will still struggle to the end. Only by completely eliminating the Kuomintang reactionary army and completely destroying the Kuomintang reactionary group's war apparatus can the people of the whole country be liberated. Therefore, after the Jinan victory, our army must resolutely guard against arrogance and rashness, and resolutely guard against underestimating the enemy, learn from this combat experience, further improve offensive tactics, prepare to overcome all difficulties, and strive for greater victories."

　　粟裕将军谈济南战役胜利
    表现我军攻坚强大威力
    【新华社华东四日电】本社记者今日访问济南战役的指挥者中国人民解放军华东野战军副司令员粟裕将军，询以济南战役胜利的原因。粟裕将军答称：
    “解放济南的胜利，首先应当归功于毛主席和党中央的英明领导。毛主席和党中央的战略思想和战略指导，使我们粉碎了敌人对山东的重点进攻，并使我军转入了进攻，最后造成解放济南并解放全山东的胜利形势。第二、是由于各战略地区军民与各兄弟兵团的密切结合，钳制了大量敌人，使敌人无法迅速向济南增援，尤其是冀鲁豫及豫皖苏广大军民直接配合作战和全力支援前线，对此次战役贡献极大。第三、由于中共华东中央局和华东军区的正确领导，以及华东党政军组织和广大人民的支援。各地方兵团积极配合作战，破坏铁路交通，歼灭与牵制敌人；各地人民夜以继日为我军修路筑桥，运送粮草弹药和伤员；这些都帮助造成了济南的胜利。第四、是我军在新式整军以后，各方面有很大的进步。指战员阶级觉悟空前提高，有旺盛的战斗意志，能团结协同，服从指挥，英勇作战，不怕牺牲，特别是攻坚能力有显著的进步。因此，我军在睢杞和兖州两大战役之后不久，就能够担负起解放济南的任务，进行大兵团的高度统一集中的攻坚战和歼灭战。第五、是充分的战役准备工作。睢杞战役以后，我军普遍进行了评功庆功，选举人民功臣及英雄模范等，开展革命英雄主义运动。从上而下进行检讨和从下而上总结战役经验，学习攻坚战术，改造俘虏，教育新战士，并准备后备力量。全军进行了战局学习，贯彻三查三整。建立与健全了各级党委制，普遍成立了战士委员会。进行了缴获归公、军事民主、城市政策等教育。组织了供给、卫生、兵站、运输等后勤工作。对战时政治工作、宣传鼓动、火线入党、火线整编、火线评功、火线政治攻势、战役报导及思想指导等一系列的工作，都在事先进行了研究并深入传达布置，使每个指战员了解作战意图与如何为解放济南与歼灭敌人而战，从思想上、政治上、组织上、物质上准备大规模的连续持久的艰苦作战。这些准备工作的实际效果，在战役中表现得最为明显。而这些，只能是人民解放军所独有，是蒋介石及一切反革命军队根本不可能做到的。”
    关于济南战役在军事上的意义，粟裕将军说：“济南解放战，集中地表现了人民解放军的无比强大，特别是攻坚能力的强大。济南北靠黄河南倚泰山，地形险要，易守难攻。在日寇占领期内，即曾筑有坚固的防御工事；昌河解放以后王耀武又督率所部日夜加修。在周围纵深百里内，遍布钢骨水泥堡垒千余个，及无数个地雷阵，无数道电网、石墙、鹿寨、壕沟，守以十多万重兵；然而在人民解放军的攻击之下，只经八昼夜激战，便遭到了粉碎的打击。这证明蒋介石的任何防御，皆挡不住人民解放军的进攻，人民解放军能够攻占任何坚固设防的大城市。人民解放军不仅能够在运动战中，于很短的时间内歼灭大量敌人，而且在攻坚战中，于很短时间内亦能歼灭大量敌人。仅就此次济南战役来说，歼灭敌人的数量就比战争初期全国各战场一个月内歼敌的总数还要多。去年八、九月间，王耀武正得意忘形地说什么“山东共军已经肃清”；但仅仅经过一年多时间，到今天在山东境内被肃清的，不是“共军”；而是数十万包括王耀武本人在内的国民党军队。这些，都说明了我军愈战愈强，敌人愈战愈弱，敌我力量对比和战争影响，都已经发生了而且将继续发生着根本的变化。国民党反动派正日益走向最后失败，我们正日益走向全国胜利。可是同时必须记着：我们此次胜利虽然很大，但蒋介石在美帝国主义指挥下，还会最后挣扎。只有彻底消灭国民党反动军队，及彻底摧毁国民党反动集团的战争机构，全国人民才能得到解放。因此，济南大捷以后，我军必须力戒骄傲，力戒轻敌，很好地学习此次作战经验，进一步提高攻坚战术，准备克服一切困难，为争取更大的胜利而努力。”
