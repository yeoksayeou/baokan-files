Lenin on Labor Discipline
(Lenin's speech in 1920, published in Pravda on January 21, 1928)

Why were Yudenich, Kolchak, and Denikin defeated by us despite being aided by capitalists from all over the world? Why are we now confident that we can overcome economic disruption and revive industry and agriculture?

We were able to triumph because the Red Army, workers, and peasants knew that they were fighting for their own survival.

We were able to triumph because the entire proletariat and the best elements of the peasantry displayed unprecedented heroism, demonstrated miraculous courage, endured unheard-of suffering and sacrifice in this struggle against the exploiters, and ruthlessly expelled the selfish and cowardly.

Now, the reason we are deeply convinced that we can overcome economic disruption today is because the entire proletariat and the best elements of the peasantry are stepping forward with the same awareness, the same determination, and the same heroic spirit to join the battle.

And when millions of laborers unite as one and follow the best elements of their class forward – victory is assured. The selfish are driven out of the army. We say in unison:

"Down with the selfish, down with those who only care about personal gain and seek personal advantage, those who slack off at work, down with those who fear to endure the necessary sacrifices for victory!"

Long live labor discipline, labor enthusiasm, and loyalty to the cause of the workers and peasants!

Eternal glory to those who sacrificed themselves in the vanguard of the Red Army!

Eternal glory to those who are now leading millions of laborers and marching at the forefront of the labor army with the greatest enthusiasm!

　　列宁论劳动纪律
    （一九二○年列宁的讲演，一九二八年一月二十一日在真理报发表）
    尤登尼奇、高尔察克、邓尼金虽然受到全世界资本家的援助，却被我们打败了，这是为什么？现在我们有自信能够战胜经济破坏，能够复兴工业和农业，这又是为什么？
    我们所以能够胜利，是因为红军，工人和农民知道自己是为自己的生存而斗争。
    我们所以能胜利，是因为全无产阶级及农民中的优秀分子在这次与剥削者斗争中发挥了旷古的英雄主义，表现了神奇的英勇，忍受了所未闻的苦难和牺牲，并无情的驱逐了自私者和懦弱者的缘故。
    现在，我们所以深信今天能够战胜经济破坏是因为全无产阶级及全农民中的优秀分子以同样的觉悟，以同样的坚决心，以同样的英勇精神挺身参加战斗的缘故。
    并且当千百万的劳动者团结成一个人跟随在自己阶级的优秀分子前进时，——胜利便有了保证。自私者被赶出军队。我们齐声说：
    “打倒自私自利者，打倒那些只顾个人利益投机取巧，工作偷懒的人，打倒那些畏惧为了胜利而忍受必要的牺牲的人！”
    劳动纪律，劳动热情，忠诚于工农事业万岁！
    牺牲在红军先锋队伍中的人们永远的光辉荣耀吧！
    现在带领千百万劳动者，以最大热情走在劳动大军最前端的人们永远的光辉荣耀吧！
