(Jilu Yu Electric Message) The Fan County and Nanle County Party Committees carefully inspected the absolute egalitarianism errors in some villages at the end of the land reform. They pointed out that the source of this error was the lack of clear purpose in ending the land reform and correcting deviations, and a lack of understanding that this was to enable people of all classes to develop production and achieve unity. Therefore, some villages with minor problems were made bigger by some cadres. For example, Gao Changzhuang in the Fourth District of Fan County had 50 households and 204 people, with 677.096 mu of cultivated land, averaging more than 3.3 mu per person. There were no landlords in the village, only one rich peasant, who was "suppressed" during the land reform, leaving each person with 1.9 mu of land. In addition, one middle peasant household was struggled against, and two middle peasant households "volunteered." The land problem of the poor peasants has been resolved, and the quantity and quality are not far apart. The "volunteering" middle peasants also retained more than 3.5 mu of land per person, so there was no need to supplement land. The wrongly struggled middle peasant also had 2.6 mu per person. After supplementing 0.8 mu, each person would have 3.4 mu, reaching the average. The one rich peasant household will be resettled with another 5 mu, which can maintain their lives. In short, the land reform can be ended and land rights determined with a slight adjustment. However, the village also has 5 mu of public land, and the rich peasants are still concealing 3 mu of black land. There is no need to touch the land of the middle and poor peasants at all. However, the work in the village stipulated that land above 3 mu should be drawn out, causing mass unrest and affecting autumn plowing and planting. During the land reform in Qin Makou, First District, one landlord household and three rich peasant households were struggled against. Feudalism was eliminated, the land problem of the poor peasants was solved, and each person received 4 mu of land. The landlords and rich peasants needed to be resettled. Originally, the problem could be solved by moving five households, but a rule came to the village that everyone should retain 3.5 mu of land, and all land above that would be drawn out, causing the masses to be discouraged, the landlords to be happy, and the farmers' association chairman to feel isolated and hesitant to move forward. In Bali Village, First District, among the nine households that were struggled against, four landlord households made a fortune by doing business after being struggled against, and their lives were not a problem. Among the four middle peasant households, one also started a small business, and the other was a rich peasant. If the middle peasants are supplemented with 3 mu of land, and are resettled separately according to their living conditions, only 27 mu of land will be needed, involving a total of seven households. But the original plan of the village was to have another round of leveling. (Before the feudal exploitation system was eliminated, the peasants demanded leveling, which was correct and revolutionary in a certain sense, and we approved this demand, which was also correct. However, after the feudal exploitation system has been eliminated and the peasants have just turned over, and the countryside only needs compensatory resettlement to end the land reform, another round of leveling is the demand of the old-style landlords and rich peasants, which is reactionary and regressive. Unfortunately, this idea has occurred in many places and deserves our attention - Editor). In Qiuzhuang, Nanle County, 20 households were liquidated and struggled against during the land reform review, including five households that were swept out and left without land, and the remaining two households had too little land, only a little over 1 mu per person. The feudal system in the village has been eliminated, and the peasants who have turned over have obtained land equivalent to the average amount. Only the landlords and rich peasants with too little or no land need to be resettled slightly, and the wrongly struggled middle peasants need to be compensated slightly to determine land rights. However, the village implemented the wrong practice of "drawing out all land above 2.9 mu," drawing out 50 mu of land from 24 middle and poor peasant households (including 7 middle peasant households and 17 poor peasant households) who had been allocated land. In terms of compensation, the rich peasants and middle peasants were not distinguished, and the actual needs were not analyzed, and all were compensated to a certain amount of land. The crops on the land that was drawn out were not distributed according to the principle of "whoever plants it, harvests it," but were divided by the households that were drawn from and the households that were compensated according to "40-60," "30-70," "20-80," and "90-10" ratios. The drawing and compensation were not carried out through the mass line, but were handled and ordered by the leaders, and the masses could not figure out what was going on. As a result, the arrogance of the rich peasants rose, demanding the return of their original property, and even stealing crops, causing unrest among the peasants. The Fan County and Nanle County Party Committees recently inspected these situations and made serious self-criticisms. The Fan County Party Committee especially criticized the fact that the process of work was not carried out through the branch, relying on the poor and hired peasants, and uniting the middle peasants, but was isolatedly handled to draw out the land already obtained by the peasants, or to call on the turned-over households to "voluntarily" give up land, causing ideological confusion in the countryside, and even creating an atmosphere that made the peasants mistakenly believe that "the landlords are rising again," which is extremely dangerous. It was clearly stipulated that: (1) Correcting deviations is for the purpose of uniting and developing production; the land distributed to the poor and hired peasants in the old liberated areas should not be touched in principle. The land needed for compensatory resettlement should be the following according to the actual situation in Fan County: 1. Group land and public land, such as militia land, land temporarily borrowed by the farmers' association with undetermined land rights, surplus residential land, sites, tree rows, and village head land. 2. Undistributed fruits. 3. Confiscate the surplus part of the land and floating wealth of landlords and rich peasants who escaped the net. 4. Unequally distributed land and floating wealth: (1) Cadres occupy too much (including leading cadres who are divorced from production). (2) Concealing black land and forming excessive occupation. (3) Settling down in two places and occupying too much. (4) Using family division to speculate and take advantage of the opportunity to occupy too much, such as deliberately sending the father or son out as a single man to get more land. (5) Middle peasants occupy too much: Generally, poor and struggling middle peasants should be allocated some land and floating wealth, which is not considered excessive occupation; if they are well-off and should not be allocated land but have been allocated it, they can return part or all of it. In addition, the extra shares that military dependents were legally entitled to in the past should not be counted as excessive occupation, but if the land is prominently large, and the person is willing, they can take out a part. The land of childless households in the village (those without legal heirs) and community land can also be cleared and returned to the farmers' association for distribution. (2) To overcome the practice of absolute egalitarianism, the leaders must specifically help find a way out, and the leading cadres must personally take action, convene village branch committee members, small district cadres, specifically study typical cases, and clear up ideological obstacles. The Nanle County Party Committee held a joint meeting of district party secretaries, using Qiuzhuang as a typical example, to study and analyze the reasons for this absolute egalitarianism error, and reviewed the wrong practices of drawing and compensating for the sake of drawing and compensating, regardless of the specific situation, damaging the vested interests of the poor peasants, even not affirming that the past struggle against feudalism was correct, and not going through the deliberation of the branch and the poor and hired peasants and the middle peasant masses.

　　补偿安置不按实际随意抽动农民土地
  　范县南乐县委规定办法坚决纠正
    【冀鲁豫电】范县与南乐两县委认真检查部份村庄结束土改中的绝对平均主义错误，指出这种错误的来源是对结束土改、纠正偏向的目的性不明确，不了解这是为了使各阶层人民都能发展生产，并达到团结。所以有的村本来问题不大，却叫一些干部把问题做大了。如范县四区高常庄，全村五零户，二零四人，耕地六七七零九六亩，每人平均三点三亩多，村中没地主，只一户富农，土改中“清剿”了，每人留地一点九亩；另外斗争了一户中农，“自动”了两户中农。贫农土地问题解决了，数量质量也不悬殊。“自动”中农留地也在三点五亩以上，不必补地；错斗中农也每人合二点六亩，再补三亩，每人即合三点四亩，达到平均数；一户富农再安置五亩，亦即可维持生活。总之，稍加调整即可结束土改，确定地权；而村中又有公地五亩，富农尚瞒有黑地三亩，中贫农土地根本不用动。可是该村工作中却规定三亩以上抽出，弄的群众动荡，影响秋耕、秋种。一区秦麻口土改中斗争了一户地主，三户富农，封建消灭了，贫农土地问题解决了，每人分到四亩地，地富需安置一下，本来动五户即可解决问题，但村中来了个每人留三点五亩地，以上的皆抽出，弄的群众泄气，地主高兴，农会长感到孤立，犹疑不前。一区八里庄被斗九户中，四户地主被斗后做生意发了财，生活不成问题；四户中农中，一户也做起小买卖，另一户是富农。如果中农补到三亩地，按生活分别安置，只二十七亩地即可，共动七户。但该村原来计划竟是再来一次推平。（在封建剥削制度未消灭前，农民曾要求推平，这在一定意义上讲是对的，革命的，我们批准了这一要求，也是正确的。但在封建剥削制度已经消灭，农民刚刚翻身，而农村中仅需要补偿安置以结束土改，再来一次推平，则是地主旧式富农的要求，是反动的，倒退的，不幸这种思想很多地方发生了，值得引起我们的注意——编者）南乐县的仇庄，土改复查时清算斗争了二十户，其中扫地出门未留田地五户，其余还有两户的留地太少，每人一亩多。该村封建制度已消灭，翻身农民得到了相当于平均数的土地，只须对留地过少与未留地的地主富农稍加安置，对错斗中农稍加补偿，即可确定地权。但该村却实行“二亩九以上一律抽出”的错误作法，抽了分得土地的中贫农廿四户（其中七户中农，十七户贫农），土地五十亩。在补偿上，也是不分富农与中农，不分析实际需要，一律补到多少亩的土地。被抽之土地田禾，也未按“谁种谁收”的原则，而是被抽户和补偿户按“四六”、“三七”、“二八”、“九一”等分批了。抽补时也没走群众路线，只是领导上包办命令，群众摸不着底。结果富农气焰高涨，要索回原物，甚至发生偷庄稼现象，引起农民不安。范县与南乐县委最近检查了这些情况，都作了认真的检讨。范县县委特别批判了工作过程中不是通过支部、依靠贫雇、团结中农去进行，而是孤立地包办地去抽动农民已得土地，或号召翻身户“自动”土地，弄得农村思想混乱，甚至造成一种空气，使农民误以为“兴地主了”，这是万分危险的。并明确规定：（一）纠偏是为了团结发展生产；老区贫雇分得土地原则不动。补偿安置中所需土地，根据范县实际情况应该是以下几种：一、团体地、公地，如民兵地、农会临时分借下去地权未定的地，分配有余的宅基、场地、树行、村头地。二、未分的果实。三、漏网地主富农的土地浮财征收其多余部分。四、分配不公，多占的土地浮财：（１）干部多占（脱离生产的领导干部也在内）。（２）隐瞒黑地形成多占。（３）两头安家多占。（４）利用分家投机取巧多占，如故意把父或子放出去作为单身汉多分土地。（５）中农多占：一般贫苦中农应分得一点土地、浮财，不算多占；生活富裕不应分地而分了的，可以退一部或全部。此外，军属过去法定多分的不应算作多占，但土地突出多的，本人自愿的，可以拿出一部。村中绝户地（无法定承继人者）、社地也可清理归农会分。（二）克服绝对平均主义作法，必须领导上具体帮助找出出路，领导干部要亲自下手，召集各村支部委员，小区干部，具体研究典型，打通思想。南乐县委则召开了区委书记联席会议，以仇庄为典型，研究分析了发生这种绝对平均主义错误的原因，检讨了为抽补而抽补，不管具体情况，损害贫农既得利益，甚至不肯定过去斗争封建是对的，也不经过支部与贫雇和中农群众的酝酿等错误做法。
