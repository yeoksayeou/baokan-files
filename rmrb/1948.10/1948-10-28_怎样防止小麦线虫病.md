　　In Ding County, Tang County, Quyang, Pingshan, Zhengding and other areas, there is a disease in wheat where the grains grow to the size of millet, with a slightly black color and very hard texture. If you break it open, it is full of cotton-like white threads, with no flour at all. The locals call it Mai Youzi (Tang County), Wangmu Liuliu (Quyang), Malianzi (Ding County, Zhengding), or Mai Lao (Pingshan). How does this disease occur? Some locals say: "It is caused by improper watering, with Malianzi being more common in habitually waterlogged depressions or places with too frequent watering." This experience is very accurate because, based on both experimental results and field observations, it is more prevalent in wet fields and less prevalent in dry fields, especially in areas with poor drainage. However, there are also places where the land is equally low-lying and wet, the watering frequency is also high, and other cultivation methods are completely the same, even two adjacent plots of land, one has it, and the other does not. Why is this? The locals find it very strange. In fact, it is very simple to explain. The experiences of the locals are only conditions that easily lead to the occurrence of Malianzi, not the cause of it. The real cause is those cotton-like threads in Malianzi. To the naked eye, they do not seem unusual; but if you pick a little with a needle and look at it under a microscope (a magnifying glass), something strange will appear. What are these white threads? They are all worms, like the roundworms that children pass in their stool, twisting around each other. These worms are the real cause. Initially, there are only a few old worms in a grain, but one old worm can lay over a thousand eggs, so there must be at least several thousand small worms in one grain. These small worms are usually docile in the wheat grains, neither eating nor moving. But if these Malianzi are sown in the ground along with good wheat seeds, the Malianzi swell up when they get water, and the worms inside become active when they see water. They crawl out from inside and into the soil, and when the wheat sprouts, they burrow into the good wheat seedlings, where they overwinter. When the wheat ears emerge the following year, they burrow into the ears, eat the essence of the wheat, and then lay eggs and reproduce. In this way, good wheat turns into Malianzi. So we say that the real cause is these worms. The presence of water in the field only facilitates the activity of the worms. In places without these worms, no matter how much water is applied, Malianzi will not develop.
    So how do we prevent this disease? It's very simple, just remove all the Malianzi from the wheat seeds. In the past, some locals opposed this, saying: "Malianzi do not germinate! If sown, they will not grow. It doesn't matter whether you remove them or not, they will rot in the ground and still provide some manure." This is wrong. Malianzi do not germinate (because they are not seeds), but think about it, if you sow this kind of Malianzi with several thousand worms in it along with good wheat seeds, how terrible it would be for them to develop! But Malianzi are so small, how can they be completely removed? It doesn't matter, we can introduce ways to remove them below.
    Saltwater seed selection: Experienced farmers know that Malianzi are lighter than wheat seeds and float on top of the water when poured in. However, simply using clean water cannot remove them all. If Malianzi are not completely removed, the roots cannot be cleared. So what should be done? Some people have invented the use of salt water, mixing salt and clean water in a ratio of one catty of salt to ten catties of clean water. Use this salt water to wash the wheat seeds. This way, not only Malianzi but also other weed seeds and immature wheat grains will float to the top, leaving only good wheat that is large and heavy. However, one thing to note is that wheat seeds washed with salt water must be washed thoroughly with clean water several times, otherwise, germination will be affected.
    Muddy water seed selection: In some places, salt is too expensive and difficult to buy. What should be done? You can try using good clay, drying it in the sun and crushing it into soil flour, then mixing it with water in a ratio of one catty of soil to ten catties of water to make muddy water. Using it to wash wheat seeds is also effective. However, muddy water settles quickly, so you must stir and scoop it up several times. At the same time, the soil properties are different in different places, so the ratio can be flexibly adjusted. If the soil is sticky, add more water; if it is not very sticky, add less water. You can try it several times first.
    Clean water seed selection: If you really can't buy salt and can't find good clay, then using well water can also wash out some of them. Of course, this will not be thorough, but it is still better than not scooping them out.
    Screening: Some places use sieves to screen, which can also screen out some. However, it is difficult to get the size of the sieve holes just right. If the holes are too large, good wheat seeds will also fall through, resulting in too much loss. If the holes are too small, it is not thorough.
    Winnowing: Using a winnowing machine to winnow several times is also effective, but of course, it will not be too thorough.
    Changing seeds: This is a very effective method and is very popular among the masses. Just go to people or places that do not have this wheat disease to find some good seeds. It is simple and effective, and changing the seeds in the field also makes the crops grow well.
    The six methods introduced above can all be effective. Of course, saltwater seed selection and seed replacement are the best. Some people also know that using saltwater to select seeds makes the wheat seeds clean and grow well, but they can't afford it because salt is too expensive. Our promotion agencies or village cooperatives can organize the masses to buy some salt, make some salt water, and use it together. This way, one pot of salt water can wash seeds for many families, which is much cheaper. The remaining salt water can also be used to pickle vegetables or boil out salt. Finally, one more thing to note is that, according to our understanding, this disease is expanding day by day. Previously, this disease was rare in the Jizhong area. Recently, we heard that many places also have it. This is mainly brought in with the seeds when purchasing seeds from other places or counties. Therefore, even places that do not have this disease should not be careless.

　　怎样防止小麦线虫病
    农业厅农业技术推广队
    在定县、唐县、曲阳、平山、正定一带小麦有一种病，麦粒长得和黍子一般大，带点黑色，非常硬。如果破开来看，里面全是棉花似的白丝丝，没有一点面。老乡叫它麦莠子（唐县）、王母瘤瘤（曲阳）、马莲子（定县、正定）、麦痨（平山）。这病是怎样发生的呢？有的老乡说：“是因为上水不得当的原故、在常积水的湿洼地、或浇水次数太多的地方马莲子多。”这个经验很正确，因为不论根据试验的结果，或田间的观察，都是水地里多，旱地里少，尤其排水不好的地方更是严重。可是也有些地方，同样是洼湿，浇水的次数也不少，其他耕种的方法也完全相同，甚至两块相连的地，而这块地里有，另一块地里就没有，这又是为什么呢？老乡们都觉着很奇怪，其实说起来很简单，就是因为老乡们的那些经验，都是容易发生马莲子的一些条件，并不是它的原因。真正的原因，是马莲子里那些棉花丝似的东西，用肉眼去看，倒也没有什么稀奇；可是要用针把它挑一点放在显微镜（一种放大镜）下来看，那奇怪的事就出来了。那是什么白丝呀！全都是象小孩肚里拉下来的蛔虫一样，一条一条的虫子，在互相盘旋着，这些虫子才是真正的原因。一个粒里，最初只有几条老虫子，可是一条老虫子能下一千来个卵，所以一个粒里至少要有好几千小虫子，这些小虫子平常在麦粒里也不吃也不动倒很老实，可是如果把这些马莲子和好麦种一起耩在地里时，马莲子得了水便涨了起来，里面的虫子见了水也都活跃起来，一条条从里面钻出来，爬到土里去，等麦子发了芽，便钻进好的麦苗里，当年冬天就在这里面过冬，第二年麦子出穗时，它便钻到麦穗里，吃掉麦子里的精脉，然后下卵繁殖起来，这样好好的麦子便变成了马莲子。所以我们说，真正的原因，是这些虫子。地里有水，只不过是方便虫子的活动。没有这种虫子的地方，怎样上水也不会生马莲子的。
    那么怎样防治这个病呢？很简单，只要把麦种里的马莲子去净了就行。过去也有的老乡反对，他说：“马莲子不发芽！种下也不长，去不去不要紧，烂在地里多少还顶点粪土。”这可错了，马莲子倒是不发芽（因为它不是种子），不过你想，要把这种带有好几千条的虫子的马莲子和好麦种一起种下，让它发展起来怎得了！可是马莲子那样小，怎样去得净呢？这不要紧，我们可以把去掉它的办法介绍在下面。
    盐水选种：有经验的老农都知道，马莲子比麦种轻，一倒在水里就浮在上面，可是单用清水是漂不净的，去不净马莲子，就断不清根，那怎样办呢？于是就有人发明了用盐水，按一斤盐对十斤清水的比例，对成盐水，用这个盐水去淘麦种，这样不但是马莲子，就是其他草籽和不成熟的麦粒，也都会漂上来，只剩下又大又重的好麦。不过有一样要注意，就是用盐水淘过的麦种，一定要用清水好好洗几个过，不然的话发芽要受影响。
    泥水选种：有些地方，盐实在太贵，还不易买到，这怎样办呢？可以试用好的粘土，把它晒干压成土面，然后按一斤土十斤水的比例对成泥水，用它来淘麦种也有效，不过泥水沉的快，一定要多搅多捞几次，同时各地的土性都不一样，所以配的比例可以灵活运用，土粘就多加水，不太粘就少对水，可以先多试几遍看看。
    清水选种：实在买不到盐，又找不到好粘土，那就用井水也能淘出一些，当然这不会彻底，不过还比不捞强。
    筛选：有的地方用筛子筛，也能筛出一些，不过筛孔的大小，很难恰好，孔太大了，好麦种也都漏了下去，损失太大，孔太小了，又不彻底。
    风车选种：用风车多过几次风也有效，当然不会太彻底。
    换种：这到是个很有效的办法，在群众里也很流行，只要到没有这种麦病的人家，或地方去找些好种子来就行了，又简便又有效，地里换换种，庄稼也长得好。
    上面介绍的六种方法，都可收效，当然最好还是盐水选种和换种。有些群众也知道用盐水选了，麦种干净长的好，就是因为盐太贵使不起。我们的推进社或村社可以把群众组织起来，买上些盐，化些盐水，大家共同使用，这样一锅盐水可以淘好多家，就便宜的多了。剩的盐水，还可以淹菜或熬出盐来。最后还有一点，希望大家多注意，就是这种病，据我们了解，它是一天一天的在扩大。以前冀中区本来这个病很少，最近听说有很多地方也有了，这主要是从外地外县购买种子时，随种子一起带来的，所以就是没有这种病的地方，也千万不要大意。
