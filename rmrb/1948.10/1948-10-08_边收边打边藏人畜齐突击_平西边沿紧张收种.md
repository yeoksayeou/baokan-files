[North Yue Electric] The counties along the Pingxi border have begun to transition into a tense period of autumn harvesting and wheat planting. In Lujiatan, Wanping Seventh District, only ten or so li away from the enemy stronghold of Mentougou, the masses were somewhat complacent when the autumn harvest began, fantasizing that the enemy would not come to seize grain. As a result, piles of corn and millet were left everywhere, the threshing grounds were full, and corn was drying on the roofs. After the district and village cadres conducted thorough mobilization, calling for "harvest a little, thresh a little, work a little, hide a little," and personally took the lead in organizing others, the thinking of the masses was reversed. The village cadres first moved their own crops out, and then went to each household with baskets, propagating the message while helping with the fortification of homes. The whole village helped and supervised each other in this way, and all fortification tasks were completed, except for a small amount of food left for consumption and some hemp that had not yet matured in the fields. Several groups were also formed to take turns guarding against sabotage by bad elements. In Datai Village, Fifth District, the entire village was divided into three sections, and the village autumn harvest protection committee checked each section. Through a village-wide campaign, the millet was completely harvested before the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, and the task of planting ten trees per person was also completed in conjunction. Now, two-thirds of the village's millet has been milled into rice and fortified. An Zhengpu, the director of the farmers' association, led two groups of eight people to harvest 54 mu of millet in five days, harvesting in the morning and threshing in the afternoon and evening. After the production branch cadre meeting was held in Changwan last month, the county party committee and county government specially dispatched cadres to lead the autumn harvest protection work in the border areas. Some villages in the plains set up sentry posts and established militia joint defense, while others had militia carry weapons to rush the harvest, proposing that people not be idle, livestock not be idle, threshing grounds and mills not be idle, and autumn harvest and autumn plowing tools not be idle. After the villages in the First District harvested their crops, some threshed and some milled. It is estimated that the entire county's millet will be harvested in another six or seven days. Following the tense rush harvest, the plowing teams in each village are also being put to work. The villages in the Sixth and Seventh Districts have not only proposed that the cultivated land should be plowed once in the autumn, but also that the fallow land from last year should also be completely plowed. In Fangshan, under the slogan "where the crops are ripe, the sickle will cut," by September 19th, the millet in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts had been mostly harvested, and now it has entered the stage of threshing, fortification, and autumn plowing. It is estimated that it will be mostly completed in early October. Some villages in the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts have already started autumn plowing. Dongzu Village in Laizhuo Third District is a new district, and men, women, old, and young are all involved in the autumn harvest campaign. From the 9th to the 12th of this month, they rushed to harvest 930 mu of early millet and sesame. The entire village organized 15 teams of livestock to plow the land, and 8 teams are already working, plowing 120 mu of land and planting 20 mu of wheat in three days.

　　边收边打边藏人畜齐突击
    平西边沿紧张收种
    【北岳电】平西边沿各县开始转入紧张的收秋种麦。宛平七区鲁家滩，离门头沟敌据点仅十余里，开始秋收时，群众思想上有点麻痹，幻想敌人不来抢粮，各家都放的一堆堆的棒子和谷个子，场里也堆的满满当当的，房上也晒着棒子。经区村干部一面深入动员，号召“收点、打点、干点、藏点”，一面亲自带头组织别人，才扭转了群众的思想。村干部先将自己的搞出去，以后再背了背篓到各户，一面宣传一面帮助坚壁，全村这样互相帮助互相督促，除留下很少一部吃的和地里长着麻未熟的外，全部完成坚壁任务。还结成几个小组轮流看守，以防坏人破坏。五区大台村将全村分成三个片，村护秋委员会挨片检查，经全村突击，阴历八月十五前即把谷子全部收割完，并结合着完成了每人种十棵树的任务。现在全村有三分之二的谷子碾成米坚壁了。农会主任安正普领导的两个组八个人，五天割谷五十四亩，都是上午收下午和晚上打。昌宛在上月开了生产支干会后，县委、县府专抽出干部领导边沿区的护秋工作，平原区有的村设立岗哨，建立民兵联防，有的村民兵携带武器抢收，提出人不闲，牲口不闲，场和碾子不闲，秋收秋耕的家具不闲。一区各村收了庄稼后，打的打碾的碾，全县的谷子估计再有六七天就要收割完毕。随着紧张的抢收，紧跟着各村抢耕的牛犋也上套了，六、七区各村不但提出熟地要秋耕一次，去年的熟荒也要全耕过。房山在“庄稼熟到那里，镰刀割到那里”的动员口号下，到九月十九日止，三、四、五、六区谷子已大部割完，现已进入打谷、坚壁、秋耕阶段，估计十月初即可大部完成。三、四、六区有的村已开始秋耕。涞涿三区东祖村是新区，男女老少都卷入秋收运动，本月九日至十二日三天中，突击完早谷、芝麻等共九百三十余亩，全村组织十五犋牲口耕地，现有八犋已动了起来，三天耕地百二十亩，种小麦二十亩。
