Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: Mudanjiang, a poisoned consumer city during the puppet Manchukuo era, has become a newly emerging and fairly electrified production city after three years of construction since liberation. According to a survey at the end of July this year, the city has a total of 4,777 industrial and commercial establishments, of which industry accounts for more than a quarter, totaling 1,238. In addition to large-scale state-owned factories, the 59 iron factories have a total of 239 machine lathes, using 4,606 horsepower, and can not only manufacture general machinery but also more complex machinery. There are 30 sawmills, which can produce 600,000 cubic meters of timber annually. The textile industry can now produce 15,000 bolts of cloth per month. The chemical industry has a total of 57 factories producing matches, pine root oil, enamel, rubber, paper, and pharmaceuticals. Before the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese invaders in 1945, the city had only 1,500 industrial and commercial establishments, and fewer than 60 factories engaged in ironwork, timber, and textile production. During the puppet Manchukuo era, the most prosperous businesses in the city were open and semi-open opium dens, with more than 600 establishments. At that time, among the city's population of approximately 230,000, more than 10,000 were addicted to opium.

Since liberation, especially since last year, the characteristics of industrial and commercial development in Mudanjiang City have been that the speed of industrial development exceeds that of commerce, and the proportion of improper or non-essential industries has been decreasing. In January of last year, there were more than 1,700 licensed industrial and commercial establishments, of which catering, hairdressing, and other industries accounted for 882 households, accounting for more than one-half. By the end of July this year, barbershops, hotels, and other establishments had decreased to 336, accounting for only one-fourteenth of the total. At the same time, the development of industry can also be seen from the proportion of electricity consumption; the share of power electricity for industrial use has greatly increased in the city's total electricity consumption. In October 1946, power electricity accounted for 18.6 percent of the city's total electricity consumption, electric heating accounted for 12 percent, and electric lighting accounted for 69.4 percent; in July this year, power electricity accounted for 76.8 percent of the city's total power supply, electric heating accounted for 6.7 percent, and electric lighting accounted for 16.5 percent. In 1946, there were 220 industries in the city using power electricity, while in July this year, the number increased to 450, and the horsepower increased fivefold. The city has now developed into a fairly electrified city. Due to the development of industry, a large number of people in the city have entered factories and found legitimate occupations. In addition to those engaged in handicrafts and household sideline occupations, more than 20,000 workers in the city have joined trade unions.

　　牡丹江成为相当电气化的城市
  　工业发展速度超过商业
  　非必需的行业日趋减少
    【新华社东北十八日电】伪满时代的一座毒化的消费城市——牡丹江，经过解放后三年的建设，现已成为一座新兴的相当电气化的生产城市。据今年七月底调查：全市工商业户数共为四千七百七十七家，其中工业占四分之一强，计一千二百三十八家。除国营大规模工厂外，五十九家铁工厂现有机器车床共二百三十九台，使用动力达四六零六匹马力，不仅能制造一般机器，且可制造较复杂的机器。制材业有三十家，全年可制材六十万立方米。纺织业现每月可产布一万五千匹。化学工业有火柴、松根油、珐琅、胶皮、造纸、制药等共五十七厂。一九四五年“八一五”日寇投降前，全市工商业不过一千五百家，从事铁工、制材、纺织等生产的工厂则不到六十家。伪满时代该市最兴盛的是公开与半公开的鸦片烟馆，有六百余家。当时全市约二十三万的人口中，曾有一万以上染有鸦片嗜好。
    解放以后，特别是去年以来，牡丹江市工商业发展的特点是工业发展速度超过商业，不正当或非必需的行业所占比重日益减少。去年一月有许可证的工商业有一千七百余家，其中饮食、理发等行业有八百八十二户，占二分之一以上。今年七月底，理发馆、旅店等则减少至三百三十六家，只占总数的十四分之一。同时从用电的比例上，也可以看到工业的发展，工业用的动力电在全市用电量中份量大增。一九四六年十月，全市动力电为全市用电量的百分之十八点六，电热占百分之十二，电灯占百分之六十九点四；今年七月，全市动力电则占全市送电量百分之七十六点八，电热占百分之六点七，电灯占百分之十六点五。该市在一九四六年用动力电的工业有二百二十家，而今年七月则增至四百五十家，马力增加了五倍。现该市已发达为相当电气化的城市。由于工业的发展，该市大量人口进入工厂找到了正当职业。全市除从事手工业和家庭副业者外，参加工会的工人已有两万多人。
