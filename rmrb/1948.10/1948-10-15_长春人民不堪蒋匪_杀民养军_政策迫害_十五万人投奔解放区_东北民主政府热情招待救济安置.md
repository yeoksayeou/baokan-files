    Changchun People, Unable to Bear Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang's "Killing People to Feed the Army" Policy, 150,000 People Flee to Liberated Areas; Northeast Democratic Government Warmly Receives, Rescues, and Resettles Them
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th dispatch】Under the cruel persecution of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's "killing people to feed the army" policy in Changchun, hundreds of thousands of starving people, robbed of all their food and on the verge of death, are successively fleeing to the liberated areas. As of now, according to extremely incomplete statistics, the democratic government has sheltered and rescued over 150,000 refugees. Recently, in the refugee reception areas designated by our army around the city, refugees fleeing from Changchun, supporting the old and carrying the young, are arriving in an endless stream. In order to save these refugees, our army and political authorities on the outskirts of Changchun organized a refugee handling committee as early as three months ago. This committee has so far distributed more than 6,000 tons of grain, 60 million yuan in relief funds, and 50,000 jin of salt. The refugee committee has set up several refugee reception stations and offices within our army's front line of defense, responsible for receiving refugees, providing food and lodging, registration, inspection, relief, and repatriation. Every refugee fleeing from Changchun is given one jin of relief grain and two liang of salt per day. Countless porridge pots for rescuing refugees are constantly cooking, surrounded by malnourished and emaciated refugees, all victims of the Kuomintang's reactionary policies. Many refugees, holding up their bowls of porridge, couldn't help but shed tears of emotion, saying, "I don't know how much gold this bowl of rice is worth." Refugees with relatives and friends in the liberated areas are given grain and travel expenses by the democratic government to help them go and rely on their relatives and friends. The remaining refugees, the Northeast Political Committee has decided that Jilin, Songjiang, Liaobei, and Longjiang provinces will be responsible for receiving them. The Jilin Provincial Government has designated ten counties, including Jilin, Jiaohe, Dunhua, Shulan, and Panshi, as refugee resettlement areas. Each of the ten counties has assigned personnel to be responsible for designating villages and settlements for proper resettlement. Those with labor power are organized to participate in production, while the elderly, weak, women, and children without labor power are helped to settle down and start a business by local mass donations. When the Changchun suburban refugee reception station transfers refugees to various rear areas, grain and travel expenses are issued according to the regulations. There are reception stations along the way, a large station every forty li and a small station every twenty li, providing food, lodging, and tea. With the help of the government in the liberated areas, refugees who were shot or injured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits or became ill while escaping received medical treatment, and those who unfortunately died were buried. Those who were unable to move due to long-term starvation were also helped by others to push carts, carry burdens, and carry children. The refugees were so moved that they burst into tears, and many old ladies kowtowed to the People's Liberation Army, saying, "The Communist Party saves the living and buries the dead. You can never find such benefactors in this world."
    Among the refugees who fled are a large number of skilled workers, young students, and doctors, lawyers, and other professionals. According to a four-day count by the Changchun Office of the Refugee Handling Committee, among more than 6,000 refugees, there were 266 technicians, 114 students, 26 doctors, and 80 teachers and other professionals. These personnel have been respectively placed in employment and schooling. Since July, two thousand teachers and students from Changchun University have fled to the liberated areas. When they talked about the Kuomintang's deception and cover-up, they all said with hatred: "This lesson in Changchun has truly made us recognize the Kuomintang's true colors!"

　　长春人民不堪蒋匪“杀民养军”政策迫害
    十五万人投奔解放区
    东北民主政府热情招待救济安置
    【新华社东北十四日电】在长春蒋匪“杀民养军”政策的残忍迫害下，数十万被抢光了粮食而奄奄待毙的饥民，正陆续投奔解放区。截至目前为止，民主政府收容救济的难民，据极不完全统计，已超过十五万人。最近以来，在城周我军所指定的难民收容地带，每日自长春逃出的难胞，扶老携幼，络绎不绝。为了拯救这些难胞，长春外围我军政当局早在三个月前即组织了难民处理委员会。该会迄今已先后发放了六千余吨粮食，六万万元救济金以及五万斤食盐。难委会在我军前沿警戒线内，设置若干难民收容站办事处，负责招待难民食宿及登记、检查、救济、遣散等事项；对于所有自长春逃出的难胞，每人每天均发给救济粮一斤，盐二两。无数救济难民的粥锅，终日炊烟不断，围满了面黄饥瘦的难胞，他们都是国民党反动政策的牺牲者。很多难胞端起粥碗，止不住激动的流泪，说：“这碗饭不知道值多少金子。”难民中有亲友在解放区者，由民主政府发给粮食路费，助其往亲友处投靠。其余东北政委会已决定由吉林、松江、辽北、龙江四省分别负责收容。吉林省政府已指定吉林、蛟河、敦化、舒兰、盘石等十县为安置难民地区。十县均有专人负责指定村屯妥为安置，有劳动力者组织其参加生产，无劳动力的老弱妇孺则由地方发动群众募捐救济，帮助其安家立业。长春城郊难民收容站在向后方各地转送难胞时，均按规定路线发给粮食、路费。沿途设有招待站，四十里一大站，二十里一小站，供给食宿、茶水。在解放区政府的帮助下，难胞中在逃出时遭蒋匪枪伤或发生疾病者，得到了医治，不幸死亡者，得到了埋葬；因长期饥饿不能行动者，也有人帮助他们推车、挑担、背小孩。难胞们对此感动得声泪俱下，许多老太太给解放军磕头说：“共产党救活人，埋死人，世世找不到这样的恩人。”
    逃来难民中有大批技术工人、青年学生及医生、律师等自由职业者。据难民处理委员会长春办事处四天的统计，在六千余难民中，即有技工二百六十六名，学生一百一十四名，医生二十六名，教师等自由职业者八十名。这些人员都被分别安置就业就学。长春大学师生自七月迄今逃来解放区者已达两千人。他们提起国民党的欺骗蒙蔽来，无不痛恨地说：“长春这一课，算是真正认识了国民党的面目！”
