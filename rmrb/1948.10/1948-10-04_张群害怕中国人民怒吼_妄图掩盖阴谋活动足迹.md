　　*Pravda* Commentary

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. TASS, Moscow, 27th: *Pravda* recently published an article entitled "Zhang Qun Covers His Tracks," commenting on Zhang Qun's visit to Japan. The newspaper pointed out: Zhang Qun's visit to Japan was to negotiate with MacArthur on the possibility of establishing a "Far East Anti-Communist Group" composed of China, Japan, and South Korea. His three weeks of contact with MacArthur was quite sufficient for him to become familiar with the plans of his American masters and to be immersed in the idea of establishing a "Far East Anti-Communist Alliance." The planned "Far East Anti-Communist Alliance" proposes to make the revival of militarist Japan a self-evident matter. The newspaper pointed out that this is not the first time that Chinese reactionaries have expressed their willingness to use Japanese militarism as their pillar and guard. However, the Chinese people will oppose and express their opinions on this. The Nanjing authorities have begun to think of ways, and the very simple method they use is "denial." This ridiculous and unbelievable "denial" proves that the Chinese reactionaries, who are preparing this latest act of betraying the nation, are afraid of the roar of the Chinese people. Following this, the most foolish and provocative rumors were spread as a smokescreen to hastily cover up the traces of Zhang Qun's anti-people activities, and then two more "denials" were issued in succession. The Chinese reactionaries hope to confuse the Chinese people by this, using the so-called "Soviet threat" to deceive them, and gradually make them recognize the "necessity" of forming an alliance with Japanese and American militarists. *Pravda* finally pointed out that this hope is in vain. Zhang Qun and his accomplices will never succeed in covering up the traces of their recent conspiracy.

　　张群害怕中国人民怒吼　妄图掩盖阴谋活动足迹
    【新华社陕北二日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：真理报顷刊载“张群掩盖足迹”一文，评论张群的访日。该报指出：张群访日系与麦克阿瑟谈判关于成立一个由中、日与南韩所组成的“远东反共集团”的可能性。他与麦克阿瑟三星期的接洽，已十分足够使他熟识他的美国主人的计划，并使他浸透在成立“远东反共联盟”的思想中。计划中的“远东反共联盟”建议要使军国主义日本的复活成为自不待言的当然事情。该报指出：中国反动派之表示准备利用日本军国主义作为其支柱及护卫，已不是第一次了。但是，中国人民是会对此表示反对和发表意见的。南京当局已开始在想办法了，他们所运用的十分简单的方法就是“否认”。这种很可笑而不能令人置信的“否认”，证明了正在准备最近这一件出卖民族的行为的中国反动派害怕中国人民的怒吼。跟着就散布出最愚蠢而富挑衅性的谣言，作为急忙掩盖张群反人民活动的足迹的烟幕，过后又连发两次“否认”。中国反动派希望借此迷惑中国人民，用所谓“苏联威胁”这种鬼话来欺骗他们，要逐渐使他们承认与日、美两国军国主义者结成联盟的“必要性”。真理报最后指出：这种希望是徒然的。张群及其同伴想掩盖他们最近阴谋的足迹决不会成功。
