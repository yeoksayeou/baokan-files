　　The reactionary Hatta Government
    The Indonesian Hatta government, established on January 29th, like the "Renville Agreement," is the product of the U.S. representative on the UN "Committee of Good Offices" buying off upper-class Indonesian compromisers and traitors. The Hatta government is mainly composed of the Nationalist Party and the Islamic Party ("Masyumi"), and is allied with the lackeys of Dutch imperialism in the Catholic Party and the Christian Party, as well as so-called "non-partisan" pro-American elements. The Nationalist Party represents the interests of princes, nobles, large landlords, and big bourgeoisie, and has always had a compromising tendency toward "collaborationism." The Islamic Party is derived from the Islamic League, using religious color to conceal the reactionary nature of its upper-level leadership. It represents the interests of feudal groups and was an accomplice to the Dutch imperialists in suppressing the Indonesian people's struggle for independence during the Indonesian Revolution of 1926. The Catholic Party and the Christian Party mainly represent the interests of pro-Dutch upper-class Indonesian officials and have always been tools for the Dutch to enslave and numb the Indonesian people. Hatta himself belongs to the Nationalist Party and was the Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia before becoming Prime Minister.
    After the establishment of the Hatta government, it withdrew the Indonesian troops fighting behind enemy lines, allowing the Dutch army to consolidate its occupation of two-thirds of Java, one-fifth of Sumatra, and all of Madura Island, and used bayonets to force the Indonesian people to produce in rubber plantations. During the treasonous negotiations with the Dutch imperialists, in which they constantly haggled over prices, the Hatta government allowed the Dutch army to conduct "sweeps" in its occupied areas, massacring unarmed Indonesian peaceful residents. In May, the Indonesian representative to Prague, Suripno, reached an agreement with the Soviet Union through the Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia to exchange consuls. However, the Hatta government obeyed the orders of American and Dutch imperialists, ordered Suripno to be recalled, and claimed that "the Republic still adheres to its promise not to expand foreign relations," refusing to establish formal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, which supports the movement of small and weak nations. As for American imperialism, merely for the lure of some "U.S. aid," it sold Indonesia's resources to the United States, giving the United States a ten-year monopoly on all Indonesian exports.
    This line of surrender by the Hatta government has naturally been met with increasing opposition from the Indonesian people, democratic parties, and democratic groups. As early as early June, democratic elements in the Indonesian parliament had already proposed organizing a new government to replace the Hatta government. On August 22nd, the Indonesian Trade Union Congress, representing millions of workers, also explicitly demanded the resignation of the Hatta government. In response to this dissatisfaction, the Hatta government took mitigating measures on the one hand, such as expressing its willingness to reorganize the cabinet and hold sham negotiations with various political parties, etc.; on the other hand, it took repressive measures, promulgating reactionary laws, prohibiting strikes and mass demonstrations, and carrying out arrests. It continuously defamed and restricted the Indonesian Communist Party, and eventually illegally arrested its members. Now, the reactionary face of the Hatta government has been completely exposed.

### 反动的哈达政府

　　反动的哈达政府
    一月二十九日成立的印尼哈达政府，和“伦维尔协定”一样，是联合国“三国调处委员会”美方代表收买印尼上层妥协叛国分子的产物。哈达政府是以国民党、回教党（“马希乌米”）为主体，并联合天主教党、基督教党中荷兰帝国主义的走卒及所谓“无党派”的亲美分子组成的。国民党代表王公贵族、大地主、大资产阶级的利益，向来有着“合作主义”的妥协倾向。回教党是从回教联盟派生出来的，以宗教的色彩掩盖其上层领导的反动性质，它代表封建集团的利益，曾经是印尼一九二六年大革命时荷帝镇压印尼人民独立斗争的帮凶。天主教党和基督教党，主要系代表亲荷的印尼上层官吏的利益，从来就是荷兰奴化、麻痹印尼人民的工具。哈达本人属国民党，出任总理以前是印尼共和国的副总统。
    哈达政府成立以后，它撤退了敌后抗战的印尼军队，使荷兰军队得以巩固其所占领的三分之二的爪哇、五分之一的苏门答腊和全部的马都拉岛，并用刺刀驱使印尼人民在橡胶园中生产。在与荷帝不断进行讨价还价的卖国谈判当中，哈达政府曾听任荷军在其占领区内进行“扫荡”，屠杀手无寸铁的印尼和平居民。五月间，印尼驻布拉格代表苏立努经过苏联驻捷大使与苏联谈判，达成了互换领事的协议。可是，哈达政府却听从了美荷帝国主义的命令下令召回苏立努，并声称“共和国仍信守其不扩展对外关系的诺言”，拒绝与支持弱小民族运动的苏联建立正式外交关系。对于美国帝国主义，仅仅为了若干“美援”的勾引，就将印尼的资源出卖给美国，使美国获得对于印尼所有出口货物的十年垄断权。
    哈达政府的这种投降路线，当然遭到印尼人民和民主政党以及民主团体日益增涨的反对。远在六月初，印尼国会中的民主分子即已提出组织新政府来代替哈达政府的建议。八月二十二日，代表百万工人的印尼工会代表大会，也明确地要求哈达政府辞职。对于这种不满，哈达政府一方面采取了缓和的办法，例如表示可以改组内阁、与各政党举行虚伪的谈判等等；另方面，却采取了镇压的措施，颁布了反动的法令，禁止罢工和群众示威，实行逮捕。对于印尼共产党，则不断进行诽谤、限制，终至于非法逮捕。现在，哈达政府的这种反动面貌已经暴露无遗了。（新华社）
