　　Good Will Overcomes Evil
    Zhao Shuli
  　Four. "This is truly a place where reason prevails!"
    Ju Cai had been sick ever since Liu's family tried to force Ruan Ying into marriage that year, constantly suffering from stomachaches every few days. After being struggled against, his condition worsened over the past year or so due to additional anger and poor food. The frequency of his attacks increased. In November of this year (1947), when the government announced the Land Law and a work team arrived in the village, he felt uneasy, thinking he was going to be struggled against again, which exacerbated his illness. Besides stomachaches, he often couldn't sleep half the night. He stayed in bed for over ten days. However, after he was classified as a middle peasant and the cadres clearly stated during the Party rectification that he had been wrongly struggled against, his health gradually improved. By the time land redistribution was implemented in December, and he was compensated with ten mu of good land, he recovered almost to his normal state.

    He still had one unresolved concern: Ruan Ying's marriage. Since the work team's arrival, Xiao Bao had been frequently looking for Ruan Ying, insisting on clarifying the matter. He, however, maintained his old thinking, not wanting to offend anyone too much. He thought: They wrongly struggled against me, admitted their mistake, and compensated me with land. Although they didn't restore the original amount, it was enough for me to cultivate. Why make more trouble? Xiao Dan and Xiao Chang were not easy to deal with. Even if he could win against them now, they might retaliate later. He often used these words to persuade Ruan Ying, but she wouldn't listen. Once, he repeatedly explained this reasoning to her half the night, but Ruan Ying said, "I'm not afraid to offend anyone! I think that offending Xiao Dan once during the struggle against the Liu family might save us some trouble later!"

    On the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month, after breakfast, the village branch sent someone to find Ruan Ying, saying there was something that needed her testimony to clarify. As soon as they heard there was something, both Ju Cai and Ruan Ying knew what it was about. However, Ruan Ying had long wanted to get to the bottom of it, while Ju Cai was just afraid she would offend people. Therefore, after Ruan Ying left, Ju Cai, worried, also sneaked out to see how things were going.

    Since the Party rectification, the village branch had been holding meetings in the east room of the front courtyard confiscated from the Liu family last year. The south room of this courtyard was where the work team lived, the east room was where the branch held Party rectification meetings, and the west room was where the peasant association had its office. By the time Ruan Ying was summoned, the Party rectification and land redistribution were nearing completion. The peasant association committee was holding a meeting in the west room to plan the allocation of houses, while the branch was holding a meeting in the east room to discuss disagreements between Party members and the masses.

    Ju Cai was neither a peasant association committee member nor a Party member, and no one from the branch or peasant association had called him. So he didn't go to the front courtyard but went to the back courtyard to find An Fa, intending to ask An Fa to inquire for him. As soon as he entered, An Fa saw that he wasn't even using his cane and said to him, "Buddy! It seems you've finally thrown away your beggar's stick?" Ju Cai smiled and said, "As long as they don't classify me as 'feudal,' I won't be sick anymore!" An Fa said, "If they were still classifying you as 'feudal,' would those five mu of good land outside the village have been assigned to you?" Ju Cai said, "You're also a peasant association committee member. They struggled against me for fifteen mu of land but only compensated me with ten. Why didn't you fight for me? Since they said they wrongly struggled against me, why didn't they return my original land?" An Fa said, "Forget it! Forget it! When it comes to land compensation, you don't know how difficult it was for everyone! The work team and the peasant representatives' assembly and the peasant association committee studied it for ten whole days before coming up with this solution! Think about it: Many of the landlord's lands were over-occupied by cadres and activists, and the lands of middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against were taken by poor and landless peasants. Now, if the cadres and activists returned what they over-occupied to compensate the middle peasants and settle the landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes, it would only involve fifty-odd households in the whole village through drawing and compensation. But if the poor and landless peasants had to return the lands they had been given from the middle peasants and then redistribute the over-occupied lands returned by the cadres and activists, it would involve one hundred and fifty-odd households. With only two hundred-odd families in the whole village, moving one hundred and fifty-odd households would cause chaos! I think what we did this time was pretty good; it's just that everyone's land went around in a circle. Like last year when they struggled against me for fifteen mu, three mu of which were given to me. This year, Xiao Chang returned those five mu outside the village that I had, which were then given to you. That land was extorted from me by Liu Xiyuan; after Liu Xiyuan was struggled against, it went to Xiao Chang, and then Xiao Chang returned it and it was given to you, while yours was given to me; didn't that go around in a big circle?" Ju Cai said, "If Xiao Chang hadn't over-occupied it and had given you that land outside the village earlier, this circle wouldn't have been necessary, and I wouldn't have had to be a 'feudal' for a year!" An Fa said, "They've already done a self-criticism about that. It's because they over-occupied it and there were so many gaps to fill that they preyed on the middle peasants, causing you to be labeled as 'feudal' for a year. This time it's fairer than last time: Except for the middle peasants who weren't touched, everyone gets 2.7 mu per person according to area and 5.1 shi of grain according to yield. We didn't take more than a tenth, and we didn't compensate less than a tenth. We also exchanged the best and worst lands. Lands that were close enough were just left as they were. Don't you think the acreage you were compensated with is too little? According to the original yield, it's okay to exchange for twenty mu for you, as long as you don't mind if it's bad!" Ju Cai said, "I'm just joking with you! I'm very satisfied with what I was compensated with this time! I don't want to be a landlord again. It doesn't matter if it's a loss or a gain, as long as we can make a living! --Buddy! Aren't you a committee member? Why aren't you at the meeting?" An Fa said, "Today we're discussing the allocation of houses, and the people who went to the village to register the peasant association's houses haven't returned yet." Ju Cai said, "The branch sent someone to call my Ruan Ying. That child, I'm afraid she doesn't know how to weigh her words and will offend someone again. We've just gotten over it, don't let there be any more trouble! If you're going to the west room in the front courtyard for the meeting, keep an ear out for what she says." An Fa said, "Don't worry about her! I think the younger generation is better than us. We've spent our whole lives afraid of offending people, and we've always had trouble because the more we're afraid of offending people, the less they're afraid of offending us!" Ju Cai felt that what he said made sense.

    As they were talking, Lao Guai came in. He greeted Ju Cai, sat down, and said to An Fa, "You're the head of our poor peasant group. This time, when we allocate houses, you have to put in a good word for me and allocate me a place to live." An Fa said, "Didn't you bring it up at the group meeting last time? We already passed it on to the peasant association." Ju Cai said, "Lao Guai! Will it work this year?" Lao Guai said, "It will work! With a few mu of land, we'll have food and clothing, but we're just missing a place to live. Even if we harvest some grain, it'll leak when it rains." ...

    Xiao Dan also came to find An Fa. He said, "An Fa! The land redistribution is almost over. Has my application to join the poor peasant league been approved?" An Fa said, "There's a new instruction from above saying that in places where there aren't many poor peasants, we should just form poor peasant groups under the peasant association instead of forming poor peasant leagues." Xiao Dan said, "Let's just say it's a poor peasant group. It doesn't matter what it is, but I am a poor peasant. Why don't they want me? When the work team first arrived, I was the first to connect with the poor peasants, and I was the first to give the cadres suggestions. Why don't they want me when they're organizing the poor peasants?" An Fa said, "The land redistribution is almost over. What's the point of arguing about it now?" Xiao Dan said, "Heh! I say this land redistribution is far from over. The work team isn't getting to the bottom of things. The ill-gotten gains of the cadres and Party members haven't been returned at all. They're just relying on everyone's self-criticism to return some trivial things and then calling it done? The work team said that they're only compensating this one time. If we poor peasants don't pursue it, with the little ill-gotten wealth the peasant association has, after taking care of the households that were swept out of their homes, how much will we get?" An Fa said, "We don't want to get rich with that kind of money. Didn't you hear the head of the work team say at the mass meeting, 'Equality doesn't mean that every needle and thread has to be equal. It just means that everyone can produce and make a living.' I think that after redistributing the land and allocating the houses, the only ones who can't make a living are those households that were swept out of their homes. It's only right to use what the peasant association has to compensate them. We're not really families that can't make a living. We can slowly produce and make a living later!" Xiao Dan realized the conversation wasn't going his way and turned to leave, saying as he left, "No matter what, I still want to join the group. You can bring me up again when your group has a meeting!" He walked out without waiting for a response, and it seemed like he wasn't as eager to join the group anymore. After he walked far away, Ju Cai said in a low voice, "Damn it! He wants to come up with good ideas again!" An Fa said, "As soon as the work team arrived, he ran to be an activist again and gave the cadres a lot of suggestions. Later, the work team found out what kind of person he was and didn't let him join the poor peasant group. Based on those suggestions he gave the cadres, he made them sound worse than Liu Xiyuan!" Ju Cai said in a low voice, "Well, cadres like Xiao Chang are about the same as Liu Xiyuan, but Xiao Dan can't speak ill of people. He's much worse than them. Without him, Xiao Chang might not be so bad!" An Fa said, "There aren't many cadres like Xiao Chang. But even Xiao Chang is different from Liu Xiyuan. Liu Xiyuan was naturally the enemy of the poor, but Xiao Chang has also done some good things for the poor, like overthrowing Liu Xiyuan and filling in the gaps. He really put in the effort, but when he had too much power, he became reckless. Xiao Dan's suggestions weren't just about saying who was good and who was bad. He said, '...there aren't any good ones. They're all a bunch of rotten eggs. They've all embezzled a lot. They won't spit it out unless we detain them all and let the masses pursue them one by one!'" Lao Guai said, "He wants to pursue other people! Didn't he say that he always divided the top-quality fruit and that there was always a gap? He ate what he ate and sold what he sold from the mules, grain, and clothes he divided. He occupied several times more than others. Isn't he going to spit it out?" Ju Cai said, "It's too unfair to say that there aren't any good cadres. The good ones are good. I think people like Yuan Hai are pretty good!" An Fa said, "Of course! Otherwise, why would the masses elect him as the new chairman of the peasant association?"

    As they were chatting, Gou Gou shouted in the yard, "Mom! Second Aunt is here!" When An Fa's wife heard that her second sister was here, she ran out of the suite. An Fa and the others also went out to greet her. Lao Guai didn't have anything else to do, so he casually exchanged a few words with the guest at the door and left. Gou Gou led her second aunt into the house, asking, "Second Aunt! Why didn't you ride the donkey?" Second Aunt said, "Your uncle sold the donkey. What's the point of riding on donkey shit?" Gou Gou smiled and said, "Second Aunt! Do you remember what I used to ask you for when I saw you a few years ago?" Second Aunt also smiled and said, "Gou Gou is getting older and more sensible! What do you want? Still peanuts? You can't have them this year. Your uncle ate the peanut seeds in the spring and sold the donkey because he was afraid of being struggled against! --Brother-in-law, I heard you've been sick for a few days, but I haven't come to see you! Are you feeling better these days?" Ju Cai said, "I'm feeling much better these days! --Has anything happened at your house lately?" Second Aunt said, "Nothing's happened, but I'm just panicking. I heard that you have a work team here. Some people say they're here to conduct struggles, and some say they're here to rectify the cadres. I really don't know what's going on. I said it's almost the end of the year. If I don't get some real news, I won't have peace of mind, so I might as well come and find out!" Ju Cai said, "The work is going well this time! Don't be afraid! ..." Then he and An Fa prepared to introduce Second Aunt to the various tasks, including class classification, compensation for middle peasants, resettlement of landlords and rich peasants, and Party rectification. As they were halfway through the introduction, they suddenly heard a quarrel in the front courtyard. Ju Cai listened and said, "That's Xiao Bao talking! An Fa, go see if it's about Ruan Ying!" An Fa said, "Let's all go take a look!" Ju Cai said, "Can I go too?" An Fa said, "Yes! A lot of people have been watching the Party rectification meetings these days!" With that, the three of them went to the front courtyard.

    The Party rectification meeting was moved to the courtyard today: The north room door was closed, and the Communist Party flag and Chairman Mao's portrait were hung in the middle, with a table and some chairs and stools placed underneath. The comrades of the work team were sitting on the platform, including the district head and Comrade Gao. Yuan Hai was standing behind the table as the chairman. The seventeen Party members were sitting in front of the platform, and Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao were also sitting in the front because they were called by the branch. Behind them were the observing masses. When Ju Cai and the others entered, they happened to hear Xiao Chang speaking. They didn't know what he had said before, but he was saying, "... I don't have any hatred for you! I'm a Communist Party member, and I can't watch a comrade get close to someone with reactionary thoughts! I can't watch a comrade send information to the struggle object! I can't watch a comrade seduce other people's young women! We don't want this kind of person in our Party! Besides, it's not just my decision to expel you: I proposed it, the branch passed it, the branch secretary Yuan Hai reported it, and the district committee approved it. How can you blame it all on me now?" Ju Cai heard this partial speech and seemed to understand that it was about Xiao Bao, that "reactionary thoughts" and "struggle object" referred to himself, and that "seducing young women" referred to Xiao Bao's relationship with Ruan Ying, but he didn't understand what "expulsion" meant. After Xiao Chang spoke, Xiao Bao stood up and said, "I have something to say!" Ruan Ying also stood up and said, "I have something to say!" Yuan Hai said, "Xiao Bao, you speak first!" Xiao Bao said, "I have nothing to say about the Party expelling me, because whether it was a wrong struggle or not, at that time, Ruan Ying's father was considered a struggle object, and the general meeting decided that he wasn't allowed to speak. I spoke, and I violated the discipline, so I should be expelled. But I want to ask: Since he's a Communist Party member, a branch committee member, and the director of the peasant association, why did he struggle against someone during the day and then send Xiao Dan to force the person's daughter to get engaged to his child at night? Isn't that also a 'struggle object'? Doesn't that also have 'reactionary thoughts'? Is 'forcing' any better than 'seducing' when he says I shouldn't 'seduce young women'? I should be expelled as a Party member, but he should still be a branch committee member?" Before Xiao Bao could sit down, Xiao Chang stood up again and rushed to say, "It was clearly 'voluntary.' How can you say I 'forced' her?" Yuan Hai pointed at Xiao Chang and said, "Why do you keep breaking the rules? Is it your turn to speak? Wait until Ruan Ying speaks and then you can speak! Sit down!" Xiao Chang sat down again. Ju Cai quietly said to An Fa, "This meeting has some rules!" An Fa nodded. Ruan Ying stood up and said, "Comrade Gao is here and often tells us that 'women's marriage should be independent.' I'm close to Xiao Bao, and I don't hide it from my parents. How can the director say that he's 'seducing' me? If even being close is against the law, then what independence is there? The director also said that I voluntarily married his child. Am I that stupid? I'm in my twenties. Why wouldn't I marry someone my own age? Why would I like his fourteen- or fifteen-year-old child? If I wasn't forced, why would they ask my father for the gold bracelet?" After Ruan Ying finished speaking, Xiao Chang stood up again and said, "Let me speak! I think we have to call Xiao Dan here! You're colluding and insisting that I wanted the gold bracelet! I'll have Xiao Dan say who asked him for the gold bracelet!" Someone from the observing masses in the back said, "Do we need to call Xiao Dan? Ju Cai and An Fa are both here. Can't we have them say something?" Ju Cai said from afar, "I might have been sick for a few less days if they hadn't asked me for the gold bracelet! Let's find Xiao Dan! So that people won't say we're colluding again!" Yuan Hai said, "I think we should find Xiao Dan! Asking for the gold bracelet wasn't just mentioned once. If we don't prove it, I'm afraid there won't be any results if we keep talking!" The other Party members also advocated calling Xiao Dan to testify, so Yuan Hai sent the village messenger to find him.

    At this time, the people registering the peasant association's houses also returned. An Fa and the other peasant association committee members returned to the west room to discuss the allocation of houses. Yuan Hai was the new chairman of the peasant association, but because he was acting as the chairman at the Party rectification meeting, he had to entrust the affairs of the west room to the vice-chairman.

    Before long, Xiao Dan was brought in, and the Party rectification meeting continued. Xiao Chang said, "Brother Xiao Dan! Tell me, was I forcing her to get engaged or was it voluntary?" Xiao Dan wanted to clear his name, so he said, "I'll say what I have to say, without bias or harm to anyone! The director made a mistake, and I gave him my opinion, but this matter wasn't the director's fault. Now that we're implementing independence, the director asked me to go, and I personally spoke to Ruan Ying. At that time, she poured me a cup of water and said to me ..." Then he recounted in detail and truthfully what Ruan Ying had said after pouring him the water, and then said, "I'm not lying at all. You can ask An Fa if you don't believe me." Ruan Ying said, "There's no need to ask my uncle. What he said is completely accurate, but it's a pity he didn't start from the beginning. Let me add to it: On the night I was struggled against, Uncle Xiao Dan, no, Xiao Dan! I won't call him uncle anymore! Xiao Dan called my uncle to my house and first told my father that Director wanted you, Ruan Ying, to marry his child. He said that if you agreed, you could ask for a few mu of land back, but if you didn't, you would say that my father accepted the Liu family's gold bracelet. The director took the gold bracelet confiscated from the Liu family back -- everyone knows that he later sold it to the bank. He asked my father for it then, but what did my father give him? I was afraid that my father would suffer, so I poured Xiao Dan a cup of water and told him a bunch of lies: Do you think that's voluntary? Xiao Dan has been fooling people every day, so let him be fooled by me once!" Xiao Dan had wanted to interrupt her, but he couldn't find an opportunity. As soon as he heard her say that he "fools people every day," he immediately jumped up, pointed at Ruan Ying, and shouted, "Clean up your mouth! Who fools people every day?" Comrade Gao stopped him and said, "Xiao Dan, what are you doing? Are you being wronged? Don't I know what kind of person you are?" Only then did Xiao Dan sit down again. Someone from the observing masses whispered, "What are you arguing about? Who else but Xiao Dan would do this?" Without waiting for Xiao Chang to respond, the other Party members began to question him one after another: "Xiao Chang! Is this the kind of Party member you are?" "Xiao Chang! Did you report this to the branch?" "Xiao Chang! What have you been reflecting on these days?" ... Yuan Hai angrily pointed at him and asked, "How can we face anyone with a Party member like you?" Xiao Chang pleaded with tears in his eyes to Xiao Dan, "Brother Xiao Dan! Tell the truth. When I asked you to be the matchmaker, did I ask you to ask her for the gold bracelet?" Xiao Dan said, "If we're going to tell the truth, let's tell the whole truth: On the night before the struggle meeting, you called me to your house and asked me to handle this matter for you. You said, 'It'll be easy to handle while the iron is hot after the struggle tomorrow.' I said that she wanted to be 'free' with Xiao Bao. You said, 'Can't you think of a way to drive Xiao Bao away first?' It just so happened that I ran into Xiao Bao coming out of Ju Cai's house that night. The next morning, I discussed struggling against Xiao Bao with you first, and you said it was okay, so we struggled against Xiao Bao that day too. That night, I went to call An Fa and stopped by your place to ask for advice. I said, 'What if she doesn't agree?' You said, 'Watch! You can come up with a way to deal with Xiao Bao. Are you still afraid of not being able to deal with Ju Cai?' Don't you know what kind of person I am? You told me to handle it. How could I scare people if I didn't come up with some bad ideas? The idea of asking for the gold bracelet was mine, but you were the boss!" After Xiao Dan said this, Ju Cai also spoke from the back. He said, "I've lived for fifty-four years, and this is the first time I've heard Xiao Dan tell the truth! This is truly a place where reason prevails!" After he said these two sentences, all the pent-up anger in his stomach dissipated, and he comfortably sat down to rest, no longer worrying about their retaliation. Xiao Bao stood up again and said, "Chairman! Can this prove that I was set up? Can this prove that they asked for the gold bracelet? Can this prove that it was forced or voluntary?" Another Party member said, "Chairman! I propose expelling Xiao Chang just for this one matter!" Several other Party members said, "I second it," "I second it" ...

    Yuan Hai said to everyone, "I think this matter has been clarified. Let's end the meeting here this morning! As for the issue of punishment, I think we should discuss it later, because there are many other things about Xiao Chang. We can't decide his punishment based on just this one matter. Now, let the group leader say a few words!"

    The leader of the work team stood up and said, "Xiao Bao has been reporting this matter since the work team arrived here. We haven't investigated it for a long time because we wanted Xiao Chang to reflect on himself. From the actual situation that has come out today, Xiao Chang's reflection is all nonsense! Xiao Chang! Think about what this is! In order to arrange a marriage for his child, he arranged struggles inside and outside the Party, attacked his comrades, and used gangsters to threaten the woman and steal the love object of his comrades: this is completely imitating the landlords' methods. How can this be what a Party member does? What is most unforgivable is that you have been reflecting in the Party for more than a month and haven't mentioned the truth of this matter at all. As soon as someone mentions it, you defend yourself: How can this be someone who wants to change? We gave you a chance to reflect, but you didn't know how to cherish yourself. Who else can save you? Your behavior should be punished by the Party! In addition, I have to say something about Xiao Dan! Xiao Dan! We are holding a Party rectification meeting today, and you are not a Party member, so it is naturally not appropriate to punish you at this meeting. But I can give you a message first: Don't think you can always be an activist! Everyone in Xiahe Village knows your true colors! After the land reform, the masses have risen up! We can't let you act wildly like before! If you have offended anyone in the past, honestly go to them to apologize! If they forgive you, that's your good fortune. If they don't forgive you, go to the People's Court with them. If you deserve to be imprisoned, you will be imprisoned. If you deserve to be executed, you will be executed! That's your own fault, and you can't blame anyone else!"

    After the group leader finished speaking, Yuan Hai announced the adjournment of the meeting. Just as everyone stood up to leave, Ruan Ying said, "Wait a minute! Can I have independence in my marriage or not?" The district head said, "This matter isn't under the jurisdiction of the Party rectification meeting! I represent the government to answer you: Your relationship with Xiao Bao is legal. You can register at the district when you want to get married, and no one can interfere."

    After the meeting adjourned, Second Aunt squeezed in front of the leader of the work team and said, "Leader! I'm from Shanghe Village! Can you please bring your work team to Shanghe to work?" The leader said, "We'll go in January!" (End of text)

　　邪不压正
    赵树理
  　四　“这真是个说理地方！”
    聚财本来从刘家要强娶软英那一年就气下了病，三天两天不断肚疼，被斗以后这年把工夫，因为又生了点气，火食也不好，犯的次数更多一点，到了这年（一九四七）十一月，政府公布了土地法，村里来了工作团，他摸不着底，只说是又要斗争他，就又加了病——除肚疼以外，常半夜半夜睡不着觉，十来天就没有起床，赶到划过阶级，把他划成中农，整党时候干部们又明明白白说是斗错了他，他的病又一天一天好起来，赶到腊月实行抽补时候又赔补了他十亩好地，他就又好得和平常差不多了。
    他还有一宗不了的心事，就是软英的婚姻问题：从工作团才来时候，小宝就常来找软英，说非把这件事弄个明白不行。他哩，还是他那老思想，不想太得罪人。他想：斗错了咱，人家认了错，赔补了地，虽说没有补够自己原有的数目，却也够自己种了，何必再去多事？小旦小昌那些人都不是好惹的，这会就算能说倒他们，以后他们要报复起来仍是麻烦。他常用这些话劝软英，软英不听他的。有一次，他翻来覆去跟软英讲了半夜这个道理，软英说：“谁不怕得罪我，我就不怕得罪谁！我看在斗刘家那时候得罪小旦一回，也许后来少些麻烦！”
    腊月二十四这天，早饭以后，村支部打发人来找软英，说有个事非她去证不明白。一说有事，聚财和软英两个人都知道是什么事，不过软英是早就想去弄个明白，聚财是只怕她去得罪人，因此当软英去了以后，聚财不放心，随后也溜着去看风色。
    自从整党以来，村支部就在上年没收刘家那座前院里东房开会。这座院子，南房里住的是工作团，东房里是支部开整党会的地方，西房是农会办公的地方。到了叫软英这一天，整党抽补都快到结束时候，西房里是农会委员会开会计划调剂房子，东房里是支部开会研究党员与群众几个不一致的意见。
    聚财一不是农会委员，二不是党员，三则支部里、农会里也没有人叫过他，因此他不到前院来，只到后院找安发，准备叫安发替他去打听打听。他一进门，安发见他连棍子也不拄了，就向他说：“伙计！这会可算把你那讨吃棍丢了？”聚财笑着说：“只要不把咱算成‘封建’，咱就没有病了！”安发说：“还要把你算成‘封建’的话，我阁外那五亩好地轮得上你种？”聚财说：“你也是个农会委员啦，斗了咱十五亩地只补了十亩，你也不给咱争一争？既然说是错斗了我，为什么不把我原来的地退回来？”安发说：“算了算了！提起补地这事情，你还不知道大家作的什么难！工作团和农代会、农会委员会整整研究了十几天，才研究出这个办法来！你想：斗地主的地，有好多是干部和积极分子们多占了，错斗中农的地又都是贫雇农分子。如今把干部积极分子多占的退出来，补给中农和安置扫地出门的地主富农，全村连抽带补只动五十多户；要是叫贫雇农把分了中农的地退出来，再来分干部积极分子退出来的多占土地，就得动一百五十多户。一共二百来家人一个村子，要动一百五十多户，不是要弄个全村大乱吗？我觉着这回做得还算不错，只是大家的土地转了个圈子。象去年斗你那十五亩地，还分给了我三亩，今年小昌退出阁外边我那五亩又补了你。那地是刘锡元从我手讹诈法的，斗罢刘锡元归了小昌，小昌退出来又补了你，你的可是分给了我；这不是转了个大圈子吗？”聚财说：“小昌他要不多占，把你阁外那地早早分给你，这个圈子就可以不转，也省得叫我当这一年‘封建’？”安发说：“这个他们都已经检讨过了。就是因为他们多占了，窟窿多没有补绽，才去中农身上打主意，连累得你也当了一年‘封建’。这次比那次也公道：除了没动过的中农以外，每口人按亩数该着二亩七，按产量该着五石一，多十分之一不抽，少十分之一不补；太好太坏的也换了一换，差不多的也就算了。你不是嫌补的你亩数少吗？照原产量，给你换二十亩也行，只要你不嫌坏！”聚财说：“我是跟你说笑！这回补我那个觉着很满意！咱又不是想当地主啦，不论吃亏便宜，能过日子就好！——伙计！你不是委员吗？你怎么不去开会？”安发说：“今天讨论调剂房子，去村里登记农会房子的人还没有回来。”聚财说：“人家支部里打发人把咱软英叫去了。这孩子，我怕她说话不知轻重，再得罪了人家谁。咱才没有了事，不要再找出事来！你要去前院西房里开会，给我留心听一听她说些什么妨碍话没有！”安发说：“不用管她吧！我看人家孩子们都比咱们强。咱们一辈子光怕得罪人，也光好出些事，因为咱越怕得罪人，人家就越不怕得罪咱！”聚财觉着他这话也有道理。
    正说着，老拐进来了。他和聚财打过招呼，就坐下跟安发说：“你是咱贫农组组长，这次调剂房子，可得替我提个意见调剂个住处。”安发说：“上次你不是在小组会上提过了吗？已经给你转到农会了。”聚财说：“老拐！今年可以吧？”老拐说：“可以！有几亩地，吃穿就都有了，就是缺个住处，打几颗粮食也漏上水了。”………
    小旦也来找安发。他说：“安发！抽补也快完了，我这入贫农团算是通过了没有？”安发说：“上级又来了指示，说象咱这些贫农不多的地方，只在农会下边成立贫农小组，不成立贫农团了。”小旦说：“就说贫农小组吧，也不管是贫农什么吧，反正我是个贫农，为什么不要我？工作团才来的时候，串连贫农我先串连，给干部提意见我先提，为什么组织贫农时候就不要我了？”安发说：“抽补也快结束了，这会你还争那有什么用处？”小旦说：“嘻！叫我说这抽补还差得多啦：工作团都不摸底，干部、党员们多得的浮财跟没有退一样，只靠各人的反省退了点鸡毛蒜皮就能算了事吗？听工作团说，就只补这一回了，咱们这贫农要再不追一追，就凭现在农会存的那点浮财，除照顾了扫地出门的户口，那里还分得到咱们名下？”安发说：“咱也不想发那洋财。那天开群众大会你没有听工作团的组长讲，‘平又不是说一针一线都要平，只是叫大家都能生产都能过日子就行了。’我看把土地抽补了把房子调剂了，还不能过日子的就是那些扫地出门的户，农会存的东西补了人家也就正对，咱又不是真不能过日子的家，以后慢慢生产着过吧！”小旦听着话头不对，就抽身往外走，临走还说：“不管怎样吧，反正我也还愿意入组，遇着你们组里开会也可以再给我提提！”说着连回话也不听就走出去，看样子入组的劲头也不大了。他走远了，聚财低低地说：“他妈的！他又想来出好主意！”安发说：“工作团一来，人家又跑去当积极分子，还给干部提了好多意见，后来工作团打听清楚他是个什么人，才没有叫他参加贫农小组。照他给干部们提那些意见，把干部们说得比刘锡元还坏啦！”聚财低低地说：“象小昌那些干部吧，也就跟刘锡元差不多，只是小旦说不起人家，他比人家坏得多，不加上他，小昌还许没有那么坏！”安发说：“象小昌那样，干部里边还没有几个。不过就小昌也跟刘锡元不一样。刘锡元那天生是穷人的对头，小昌却也给穷人们办过些好事，象打倒刘锡元，象填平补齐，他都是实实在在出过力的，只是权大了就有蛮干起来。小旦提那意见还不止是说谁好谁坏，他说‘……一个好的也没有，都是一窝子坏蛋，谁也贪污得不少，不一齐扣起来让群众一个一个追，他们是不会吐出来的！’”老拐说：“他还要追人家别人啦！他就没有说他回回分头等果实，回回是窟窿，分得那些骡子、粮食、衣裳，吃的吃了，卖的卖了，比别人多占好几倍，都还吐不吐？”聚财说：“说干部没有好的那也太冤枉：好的就是好的。我看象人家元孩那些人就不错！”安发说：“那自然！要不群众就选人家当新农会主席啦？”
    他们正说着闲话，狗狗在院里喊叫：“妈！二姑来了！”安发老婆听说二姨来了，从套间里跑出来，安发他们也都迎出来。老拐没有别的事，在门边随便跟客人应酬了两句话就走了。狗狗一边领着二姨进门，一边问：“二姑！你怎么没有骑驴？”二姨说：“驴叫你姑夫卖了，还骑上狗屁？”狗狗又笑着说：“二姑！你记得我前几年见了你就跟你要甚来呀？”二姨也笑着说：“狗狗到底大了些，懂事多了！要什么？还不是要花生？今年要也不行，你姑夫因为怕斗争，春天把花生种子也吃了，把驴也卖了！——大姐夫，听说你病了几天，我也没有来看看你！这几天好些？”聚财说：“这几天好多了！——你们家里后来没有什么事吧？”二姨说：“倒也没事，就是心慌得不行。听说你们这里来了工作团，有的说是来搞斗争，有的说是来整干部，到底不知道还要弄个甚。我说到这年边了。不得个实信，过着年也心不安，不如来打听打听！”聚财说：“这一回工作做得好！不用怕！…………”接着他和安发两个人，就预备把划阶级、赔补中农、安插地主富农、整党…………各项工作，都给二姨介绍了一下。正介绍到半当腰里，忽听得前院争吵起来。聚财听了听说：“这是小宝说话！安发你给咱去看看是不是吵软英的事？”安发说：“咱们都去看看吧！”聚财说：“我也能去？”安发说：“可以！这几天开整党会，去看的人多啦！”说着，他们三个人就到前院里来。
    这天的整党会挪在院里开：北房门关着，正中间挂着共产党党旗和毛主席像，下面放着一张桌子和一些椅子凳子。工作团的同志们坐在阶台上，区长和高工作员也在内，元孩站在桌子后当主席，阶台下前面坐的是十七个党员，软英和小宝虽不是党员，因为是支部叫来的，也坐在前面，后面便是参观的群众。当聚财他们进去的时候，正遇上小昌站着讲话，前边不知道已经讲了些什么，正讲到“……………我跟你什么仇恨也没有！我是个共产党员，不能看着一个同志去跟个有变天思想的人接近！不能看着一个同志去给斗争对象送情报！不能看着一个同志去勾引人家的青年妇女！我们党内不要这种人！况且开除你也不是我一个人作的主：我提议的，支部通过的，支部书记元孩报上去的，区分委批准的：如今怎么能都算到我帐上？”聚财听了这么个半截话，似乎也懂得是说小宝，也懂得“有变天思想”和“斗争对象”是指自己，也懂得“勾引青年妇女”是指小宝跟软英的关系，只是不懂“开除”是什么意思。小昌说了坐下，不宝站起来说“我说！”软英跟着也站起来说“我说！”元孩说：“小宝先说！”小宝说：“党开除我我没话说，因为不论错斗不错斗，那时候软英她爹总算是斗争对象，大会决定不许说，我说了是我犯了纪律，应该开除。可是我要问：他既然是共产党员，又是支部委员，又是农会主任，为什么白天斗了人家，晚上就打发小旦去强逼人家的闺女跟他孩子定婚？那就也不是‘斗争对象’了？也没有‘变天思想’了？说我不该‘勾引青年妇女’，‘强逼’就比‘勾引’好一点？我这个党员该开除，他这个党员就还该当支委？”小宝还没有坐下，小昌就又站起来抢着说：“明明是‘自愿’，怎么能说我是‘强迫’？”元孩指着小昌说：“你怎么一直不守规矩？该你说啦？等软英说了你再说！坐下！”小昌又坐下了。聚财悄悄跟安发说：“这个会倒有点规矩！”安发点了点头。软英站起来说：“高工作员在这里常给我们讲‘妇女婚姻要自主’，我跟小宝接近，连我爹我娘都不瞒，主任怎么说人家是‘勾引’我？要是连接近接近也成了犯法的事，那还自主什么？主任又说我自愿嫁给他孩子，我那有那么傻瓜？我也是廿多的人了，放着年纪相当的人我不嫁，偏看中了他十四五岁个毛孩子？要不是强逼，为什么跟我爹要金镯子？”软英说完了，小昌又站起来说：“我说吧？我看这事情非叫小旦来不行！你们捏通了，硬说我要金镯子！我叫小旦来说说，看谁跟他提过金镯子？”后边参观的群众有人说：“还用叫小旦？聚财、安发都在这里，不能叫他两个人说说？”聚财远远地说：“不跟我要金镯子的话我还许少害几天病！还是找小旦来吧！省得人家又说我们是捏通了！”元孩说：“我看还是去找小旦吧！要金镯子这事也不止谈了一次了，不证明一下恐怕再谈也没结果！”别的党员们也都主张叫小旦来证明一下，元孩就打发村里的通讯员去找。
    这时候，登记农会房子的人也回来了，安发和别的农会委员们都回西房里议论调剂房子的事。元孩是新农会主席，可是因为在整党会上当着主席，只好把西房里的事托给副主席去管。
    不多一会，把小旦找来了，整党会又接着开起来。小昌说：“小旦哥！你究竟说说你给我说媒那事是自愿呀是强迫？”小旦想把自己洗个干净，因此就说：“我是有甚说甚，不偏谁不害谁！主任有错，我也提过意见，不过这件事可不是人家主任强迫她。如今行自主，主任托我去的时候，我是亲自跟软英说的。那时候，她给我倒了一盅水，跟我说………”接着就把软英给他倒上水以后说的那些话，详详细细实实在在说了一遍，然后说：“我说这没有半句瞎话，大家不信可以问安发。”软英说：“不用问我舅舅了，这话半句也不差，可惜没有从头说起，让我补一补吧：就是斗争了我爹那天晚上，小旦叔，不，小旦！我再不叫他叔叔了！小旦叫上我舅舅到了我家，先叫我舅舅跟我爹说人家主任要叫你软英嫁给人家孩子。说是要从下还可以要求回几亩地，不从的话，就要说我爹受了人家刘家的金镯子。没收了刘家的金镯子主任拿回去了——后来卖到银行谁不知道？那时候跟我爹要起来，我爹给人家什么？我怕我爹吃亏，才给小旦倒了一盅水，跟他说了那么一大堆诡话：大家说这算不算自愿？他小旦天天哄人啦，也上我一回当吧！”小旦早就想打断她的话，可惜找不住个空子，一听到她说了自己个“天天哄人”，马上跳起来指着软英喊：“把你的嘴收拾干净点！谁天天哄人啦？”高工作员喝住他说：“小旦你捣什么乱？屈说了你？我还不知道你是个什么人？”小旦这才算又坐下了。参观的群众有人小声说：“还辩什么？除了小旦谁会办这事？”没有等小昌答话，别的党员们你一句我一句都质问起来：“小昌！你这个党员体面呀？”“小昌！你向支部回报过这事没有？”“小昌！你这几天反省个甚？”…………元孩气得指着问他说：“有你这种党员，咱这党还怎么见人啦？”小昌眼里含着泪哀求小旦说：“小旦哥！你凭良心说句话，我托你去说媒，还叫你问人家要过金镯子？”小旦说：“要说实的咱就彻底说实的：在斗争会的头一天晚上，你把我叫到你家，托我给你去办这事，你说：‘明天斗争完了，趁这个热盘儿容易办。’我说人家早就要‘自由’给小宝，你说：‘不能想个办法，先把小宝撵过一边？’恰巧我那天晚上回去就碰见小宝跟聚财家出来，第二天早上我又跟你商量先斗小宝，你说可以，那天就把小宝也斗了。到了晚上我去叫安发，顺路到你那里问主意。我说：‘不答应怎么办？’你说：‘你看着吧！对付小宝你还能想出办法来，还怕对付不了个聚财？’你还不知道我是个什么人？你叫我看着办，我要不出点坏主意怎么能吓呼住人？要金镯子的主意是我出的，东家可是你当的！”听小旦这么一说，聚财在后边也说了话。他说：“我活了五十四岁了，才算见小旦说过这么一回老实话！这真是个说理的地方！”他说了这么两句话，一肚子闷气都散了，就舒舒服服坐下去休息，也再没有想到怕他们报复。小宝又站起来说：“主席！这总能证明斗争我是谁布置的吧？这总能证明要过金镯子没有吧？这总能证明是强迫呀还是自愿吧？”另一个党员说：“主席！只这一件事我也提议开除小昌！”另有好几个党员都说“我也附议”，“我也附议”…………
    元孩向大家说：“我看这件事就算说明了，今天前晌的会就开到这里吧！处分问题，我看还是以后再说，因为小昌的事情还多，不能单以这件事来决定他的处分。以下请组长讲讲话！”
    工作团的组长站起来说：“这件事从工作团来到这里，小宝就反映上来了，我们好久不追究，为的是叫小昌自己反省。从今天追究出来的实际情形看，小昌那反省尽是胡扯淡啦！小昌！你想想这是件什么事？为了给自己的孩子定婚，在党内党外布置斗争，打击自己的同志，又利用流氓威胁人家女方，抢了自己同志的恋爱对象：这完全学的是地主的套子，那里象个党员办的事？最不能原谅的，是你在党内反省了一个多月，一字也没有提着这事的真象，别人一提你就辩护：这那里象个愿意改过的人？给你个机会叫你反省你还不知道自爱，别人谁还能挽救你？你这种行为应该受到党的处分！此外我还得说说小旦！小旦！我们今天开的是整党会，你不是党员，这个会上自然不好处分你。不过我可以给你先捎个信：你不要以为你能永远当积极分子！在下河村谁也认得你那骨头！土改以后，群众起来了！再不能叫你象以前那样张牙舞爪了！从前得罪过谁，老老实实去找人家陪情认错！人家容了你，是你的便宜；人家不容你，你就跟人家到人民法庭上去，该着坐监就坐监，该着枪毙就枪毙！那是你自作自受，怨不着别人！”
    组长讲完了，元孩就宣布散会。大家正站起来要走，软英说：“慢点！我这婚姻问题究竟算能自主不能？”区长说：“整党会上管不着这事！我代表政权答复你：你跟小宝的关系是合法的。你们什么时候想定婚，到区上登记一下就对了，别人都干涉不着。”
    散会以后，二姨挤到工作团的组长跟前说：“组长！我是上河人！你们这工作团不能请到我们上河工作工作？”组长说：“明年正月就要去！”（全文完）
