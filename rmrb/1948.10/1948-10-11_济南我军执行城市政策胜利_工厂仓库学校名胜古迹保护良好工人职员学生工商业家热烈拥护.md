【Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th dispatch】 Sub-agency reporter reports: The Chinese Communist Party's urban policy has achieved widespread success in Jinan. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) work teams convened technicians and workers from the city's factories for discussions even as the battle was still ongoing, explaining the PLA's policies and urging them to remain at their posts and protect the factories. The column, division, and regiment levels all organized pickets in advance, specifically responsible for inspecting discipline upon entering the city. Guard units were dispatched to factories, warehouses, schools, and historical sites to stand guard and protect them. These measures were first enthusiastically supported by workers and staff in the production sector. When the fighting was still going on in Jinan, the reporter visited the water plant, which was of concern to the 700,000 citizens. The workers at the plant, understanding the PLA's policies, continued to work in shifts to guard the machinery amidst the intense artillery fire. Upon seeing the reporter, they excitedly spoke of their hopes for the PLA. Meng Zhendong, the deputy chief engineer of the plant, explained why they did not leave: "How could we leave? We built this factory ourselves. The machines are our lives. We must guard it and wait for the PLA to come, and not let the Kuomintang destroy it." Private industrialists and businessmen generally expressed gratitude for the PLA's protection. In the early days of the liberation of the commercial district, the exchange rate between the North Sea currency issued by the East China Liberated Area and the enemy currency had not yet been determined (it has now been determined). The PLA issued an order that troops were temporarily not allowed to buy anything, to avoid losses to merchants. A squad leader from a certain unit wanted to buy some candy for sick soldiers, but was stopped by the pickets. The shopkeeper was very moved and said: "The PLA's policies are implemented from the top down, how can they not win victories!" The American missionary school Qilu University and Chinese schools in Jinan received the same protection. Reverend Lin, a British teacher at the school, and more than a dozen students told the reporter: The school originally had 150 students, and more than 50 were still at the school. When the PLA's siege was at its most intense, more than a dozen of them braved the gunfire to rescue wounded PLA soldiers. They said that because Wang Yaowu's troops were stationed here for a day during the battle, the school's glass windows were smashed, and doors and tables were burned for cooking. The books in Jinan's largest library were also moved to build fortifications. The extent of the damage "cannot be repaired in a year." The memories of hatred for Kuomintang rule are now being talked about everywhere, and the misunderstandings about the Communist Party and the PLA caused by the Kuomintang's rumors and slanders are rapidly disappearing from the minds of the people of Jinan. In this regard, the PLA's mobile reading room for books, newspapers and photographs and its attached inquiry office played a significant role. From the afternoon of the 24th to the afternoon of the 27th, more than 4,800 people visited the reading room. Among them, the industrial and commercial circles accounted for 45%, and more than 200 copies of the CCP's "Industrial and Commercial Policy" booklet were requested. In the visitor's comments book, Chen Yuqing, a teacher at the Provincial Medical College, wrote: "China is saved! I see the light and have unlimited hope in my heart." Wang Dongsheng, a major staff officer of the Kuomintang's 2nd Reorganized Division who had disguised himself and gone into hiding, could not sleep all night after seeing the exhibition for a day. Early the next morning, he was the first to go to the person in charge of the inquiry office and said: "I was wrong in the past and was deceived. After seeing the exhibition, I feel that the liberated areas are truly a beacon of light. I am now reporting my identity myself. Even if I am treated as a prisoner of war, I am willing to study under your education and am willing to guide you to persuade our colleagues who are hiding together to accept the light you have brought."

　　济南我军执行城市政策胜利
    工厂仓库学校名胜古迹保护良好工人职员学生工商业家热烈拥护
    【新华社济南十日电】分社记者报导：中国共产党的城市政策，在济南得到了广大的成功。解放军工作队在战斗还在进行时就召集了市内工厂的技师和工人座谈，讲解解放军政策，要他们安心职守，保护工厂。纵队、师、团三级都预先组织了纠察队，专门负责检查入城纪律。警卫部队被派往工厂、仓库、学校和名胜古迹地区去放哨保护。这些措施首先在生产部门的工人、职员中受到热烈的拥护。当济南城内战斗尚在进行时，记者就去访问了七十万市民所关切的自来水厂。懂得了解放军政策的该厂工人，在激烈炮火中仍然轮班看守机器，看到记者就兴奋地诉说着他们对解放军的盼望。该厂副总工程师孟振东在解释他们为什么没有离开时说：“我们怎么能离开？这厂是我们亲自建造起来的，机器就是我们的命，我们要守着等解放军来，不能叫国民党破坏。”民间工商业资本家对于解放军的保护普遍表示感激。当商埠区解放之初，华东解放区发行的北海币与敌币的比值尚未规定（按现已规定），解放军通令部队暂时一律不准买东西，以免商民吃亏。某部一个班长想买点糖果给病号吃，即为纠察队阻止。商店掌柜非常感动地说：“解放军的政策上行下效，怎能不打胜仗呢！”济南的美国教会学校齐鲁大学和中国学校受到同样的保护。该校英籍教员林牧师和十几位同学对记者说：该校原有学生一百五十人，在校者尚有五十余人。当解放军攻城战最激烈时，该校曾有十几位冒着枪林弹雨救护解放军伤员。他们诉说，因为战斗中王耀武部在这里盘据了一天，学校的玻璃窗被砸破了，门板桌凳被烧火作饭了，济南最大图书馆的图书也被搬去筑工事了。破坏的程度“一年也修不起来”。对于国民党统治的仇恨的记忆现在是到处被谈论着，而因为国民党的造谣污蔑而引起的对于共产党和解放军的误解，则正在济南市民的头脑中迅速消失。在这一点上，解放军某部的随军书报照片阅览室及附设的问事处，起了很大的作用。该室从二十四日下午至二十七日下午即有四千八百余人前往参观。其中工商界占百分之四十五，要去中共“工商业政策”小册子二百多本。在参观者的意见簿上，省立医学院教员陈虞卿写道：“中国有救了！我看到了光明，心中有无限希望。”曾经化装隐蔽起来的国民党军整二师少校参谋王冬生看了一天展览后，一夜睡不着觉，第二天清早，第一个去向问事处负责人说：“我过去错了，受了欺骗；看过展览后，我觉得解放区真是一片光明。我现在自己来报告我的身份，即使当俘虏看待，我也愿意在你们的教育下学习学习，并愿引导你们去劝告我们一起隐藏的同事都来接受你们带来的光明。”
