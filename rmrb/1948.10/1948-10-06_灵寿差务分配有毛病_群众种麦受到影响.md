(North Yue News) In the past month, the corvée labor in the Fifth District of Lingshou has been extremely heavy. In early September, the Fifth District dispatched 114 large carts, which traveled for 17 days. They were first ordered to transport military uniforms to Laiyuan. When they were about to reach Laiyuan, they were ordered to transport them to Longquanguan in Fuping. After arriving at Longquanguan, they were ordered to transport them to Daixian. Only when the livestock were completely exhausted were they allowed to return. Two or three days after returning, 100 large carts were again needed to transport military uniforms to Huolu, which took two days. In the latter half of August, 8,000 sets of cotton military uniforms were issued. As soon as they were made and collected, 20,000 pairs of quilted socks were issued on the 16th of this month. The two items required a total of 71,000 workdays (calculated at three workdays per pair of quilted socks and one and a half workdays per set of military uniforms, this is still short by 1,000 workdays). The district has a total of 6,530 young and middle-aged women, averaging about 10 workdays per person. In addition, starting on September 7th, the Fifth District mobilized all young and middle-aged labor in the district to repair roads for five days. Three automobile roads totaling 45 li in length and about ten meters in width were built, destroying a considerable amount of land. Some sorghum and millet were about to ripen, and the people asked to wait for ten or eight days so that they could harvest the crops and repair the roads themselves. The section chief sent by the county did not allow it. However, the road has been repaired for ten days and not a single car has been seen passing by, which makes the masses very dissatisfied. From the latter half of August to the first half of September, the district used a total of 161,088 workdays (the entire district has more than 30,000 people).

According to the Fifth District Committee of Lingshou and the brigade department cadres, the Fourth District is much lighter. The Fourth District did not make cotton clothes or quilted socks, and only repaired one road of 15 li, while the population of the Fourth District is not much different from that of the Fifth District. Therefore, the masses in the villages near the Fourth District in the Fifth District all said, "Why are all the corvée duties placed on the Fifth District?" Because of the busy corvée duties, the autumn harvest and wheat planting in the district have been greatly affected. The cadres of the village militia departments have been busy with dispatching, receiving, and collecting clothing and socks for a month, and have not been able to engage in production properly. Hu Xi (village head) of Hudong Village said, "Please replace me, or I'll have to beg for food!" Many also said, "My wife won't let me eat!" Recently, several new cadres have cried about this matter.

According to comrades in the sub-district armed forces department, the main reason for this phenomenon is that the tasks are urgent and there was no overall plan in advance (the urgency of the task has contributed to a serious imbalance). (He Jianping)

(Everything is for the front line, and wartime labor burdens are the people's duty and should be borne. The leadership must meticulously organize and scientifically arrange them so that they are fair and reasonable, and pay special attention to taking care of the farmers' busy harvest and planting seasons as much as possible. However, as reflected in the report, if the matter of cutting ripe crops to repair roads is truly a military emergency, it is justified. However, if it is repaired and not used immediately, is there a bureaucratic style of not caring about the interests of the masses and not making accurate calculations? It is worth checking! - Editor)

### 灵寿差务分配有毛病　群众种麦受到影响

　　灵寿差务分配有毛病
    群众种麦受到影响
    【北岳讯】近一个月以来，灵寿五区差务极为繁重。九月初五区出了大车一百一十四辆，走了十七天，先叫把军衣运到涞源，快到涞源时又叫运到阜平龙泉关，运到龙泉关后又叫运往代县，因牲口实在累得不行了才回来。回来后两三天，又要了一百辆大车运军衣至获鹿，去了两天。邻区四区第一次去了四十辆，第二次则没有去。八有后半月发来棉军衣八千套，刚刚作好收齐，本月十六日又发来夹袜二万双，两宗共需工七万一千个（按夹袜三个工一双，军衣一个半工一套计算尚少一千工）。该区共有青壮妇女六千五百三十个，每个平均约十个工。此外，五区于九月七日开始，全区青壮劳力总动员修公路五天，三条汽车路共四十五里，路宽十来米，毁地不少，有些高粱、谷子眼看就熟，老百姓要求等个十天八天，割了庄稼，自己将路修好，县里派来的科长不允许。但该路修好已有十天，未见一辆汽车路过，群众很不满意。从八月后半月到九月前半月，全区共用工一六一○八八个（全区三万余人）。
    据灵寿五区区委与大队部干部谈，四区比该区轻的多，棉衣、夹袜，四区未做，修路四区只修了一条，十五里，而四区人口与五区相差不多。因而五区靠四区的村庄群众都说：“为什么勤务都放在五区了？”因为勤务繁忙，该区秋收种麦受到不小影响。各村中队部的干部一月来都忙于派差，领发，收回衣袜，没有好好生产，胡洞村胡喜（村长）说：“把我换换吧，光这样就得要饭了！”说“老婆子不叫吃饭了”的也很多。最近新干部为这事有好几个哭的。
    造成这现象的原因，据分区武装部同志们说，任务急迫，事先没有通盘计划是主要原因（任务急迫促成了严重的不平衡）。　（何建平）
    （一切为着前线，战勤负担是人民的义务，是应当的。领导上必须精密组织科学按排使之公平合理，特别要注意尽可能照顾农民收种的农忙季节。但如报导中所反映割了快熟庄稼修公路的事，如真为军事急需，那是应该的，但修好后又没即时用，这中间是否有不关心群众利益不精确计算的官僚主义作风存在呢？值得检查！——编者）
