　　Sufficiently Powerful Democratic Forces
    Fear No War of Nerves
    "New Times" on the Berlin Situation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th] TASS dispatch: Moscow's "New Times" magazine published an article "On the Berlin Situation," stating that official spokespersons of Western countries claim that, according to the Four-Power agreements made during and after the war regarding Berlin and the German question, they have the right to occupy the western sectors of Berlin. However, they cannot but admit that these agreements also stipulated their obligation to implement the Allied agreements regarding the whole of Germany, to implement the eradication of German militarism and the democratization of Germany, etc. The occupying powers had guaranteed that Germany should be treated as an economic whole. They have not fulfilled these obligations and have instead taken the opposite path. "New Times," in discussing the unilateral action of the US, Britain, and France in submitting the Berlin issue to the Security Council, pointed out that it is no accident that this activity is being carried out at the time when the UN General Assembly begins its discussions. The entire evil plan of Marshall and Bevin is set at this moment. The people of all countries wish to see the United Nations organizations safeguard peace and security. But the imperialist bloc is constantly dreaming of turning the United Nations into a diplomatic tool for their arbitrary extortion. The enemies of peace fear peace, but sufficiently powerful democratic forces fear no war of nerves. Those who are tired of the guarantees made during the war have long since decided to engage in actions that have nothing to do with international peace and security. These people intend to take another step to drag the United Nations into matters outside its jurisdiction, but this will not do them any good.

　　充分强大的民主力量
    不怕战争神经战
    “新时代”论柏林形势
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社讯：莫斯科“新时代”杂志发表“论柏林形势”一文称，西方国家官方发言人声称他们根据四强在战时和战争结束时所订立的关于柏林和德国问题协定，有占领柏林西区的权利。但他们也不能不承认在这些协定中还规定了他们执行盟国关于整个德国的协定的义务，执行肃清德国军国主义及使德国民主化等的义务。各占领国曾保证德国应作为一个经济整体来处理。他们并没有执行这些义务，反而采取了相反的路线。“新时代”在论及美英法三国将柏林问题提交安理会的片面行动时指出，选择在联大开始其讨论时，进行这一活动并不是偶然的。马歇尔和贝文的整个邪恶计划，就是定在这个时刻。一切国家的人民愿见联合国机构保障和平与安全。但帝国主义集团却无时无刻不在梦想着将联合国变为他们肆意敲榨的外交工具。和平的敌人害怕和平，但充分强大的民主力量，不怕战争神经战。那些厌烦战时所作保证的人们早就决定放手从事与国际和平安全毫不相关的行动，这些人打算采取又一步骤将联合国卷进非它所管的事情，但这是不会对他们有什么好处的。
