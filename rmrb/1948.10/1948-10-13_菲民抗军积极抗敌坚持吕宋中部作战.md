Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. According to a Reuters Manila dispatch: The Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army has been actively conducting guerrilla warfare in Central Luzon for the past ten days. At the end of last month, the Philippine reaction government army reinforced its troops from Manila to the north, and dispatched aircraft and artillery to bombard several fortified strongholds of the People's Anti-Japanese Army in the Candaba Swamp area (50 kilometers north of Manila). The People's Anti-Japanese Army fought against the invading enemy in the provinces of Bulacan (20 kilometers north of Manila), Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija. According to a report by the Electric News Agency: When Philippine President Quirino reorganized his cabinet at the end of last month, he appointed Baluyot as Minister of the Interior, foreshadowing that the Philippine government will adopt a more brutal policy of suppression against the People's Anti-Japanese Army. Baluyot has close ties with the most reactionary feudal landlord group. Before the war, when he was the governor of Pampanga Province, he was notorious for crushing peasant uprisings. The Electric News Agency also stated that the People's Anti-Japanese Army peasant movement was formed during the war as the core of the Philippine resistance against Japan, and was completely preserved after the war in order to implement the peasants' demands for land reform and fair distribution of harvests between landlords and tenants.

　　菲民抗军积极抗敌坚持吕宋中部作战
    【新华社陕北八日电】据路透社马尼拉消息：菲民抗军旬日以来在吕宋中部积极进行游击战。菲反动政府军曾于上月底从马尼拉北援，并出动飞机与大炮轰击民抗军在坎达瓦湖沼地带（马尼拉以北五十公里）的若干强固据点。民抗军在布拉坎（马尼拉以北二十公里）、班邦加、奴瓦伊西加等省抗击进犯之敌。据电通社报导：菲总统季里诺于上月下旬改组内阁时任命巴鲁约特为内政部长，预示菲政府将对民抗军采取更残酷的镇压政策。巴鲁约特与最反动的封建地主集团有密切联系，战前任班邦加省省长时即以摧残农民起义而恶名昭彰。电通社又称：民抗军农民运动是在战时组成，作为菲律宾抗日的核心，在战后仍然完整地保存，以执行农民对于土地改革及在地主与佃农间公平分配收获物的要求。
