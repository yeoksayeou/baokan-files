【Jinzhong News】Since the Jinzhong Campaign, the Yan Faction has collected its remnants and stubbornly defended the isolated city of Taiyuan, attempting to make a final struggle. However, his soldiers have all felt that Yan Xishan's final demise is imminent. Coupled with the fact that they are starving every day (regular troops are stipulated to receive 13 liang of white flour on the new scale per meal, but in reality, after deductions, they can only eat half a jin on the old scale), and they lack salt and vegetables, their morale is extremely low. They generally want to go home, plan to escape, or hope that the People's Liberation Army will liberate them. However, due to Yan's deceitful propaganda and secret agent rule, some people do not understand us. Many Yan soldiers, although they have thoughts of escaping and surrendering to us, cannot act decisively. They still have doubts about our lenient policy.

When we launched the political offensive, the first thing we did was to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and correctly implement the lenient policy. We held mass meetings to publicize the situation and explain our lenient policy; we held symposiums for puppet family members to point out their future from their own interests and the situation, to dispel their doubts with concrete facts, to expose all the enemy's deceptive propaganda, and to enlighten them to find ways to reclaim their relatives from the Yan army. In dealing with specific issues, we truly grasp the lenient spirit of "those who are coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded." For example, in Dongwanshou Village, Yangqu First District, Zhang Shuangzi was a soldier in the enemy's People's Defense Army. The enemy forced him to return to the village to collect grain and scout our situation. We discovered him, and after explaining the lenient policy, he immediately confessed and denounced the Yan army's crimes, guaranteeing that he would never do anything detrimental to the people again. Later, he was taken back to his village and released in public. Under this influence, three People's Defense Army members who had been hiding at home in the village for a long time came to see us, and the masses also told me about all the puppet bandits who had not returned to the village, and through them, they managed to call back most of them.

Secondly, the entire party, government, army, and people are mobilized, working together and consistently under the goal of besieging Taiyuan and eliminating the Yan Faction, combining the investigation of the enemy's specific situation in the front with the search for social connections in the rear. Villagers treat all returnees who have escaped equally, not only without discrimination, but also trying to settle their lives. This has created a mass persuasion movement of wives calling for husbands and mothers calling for sons. In addition, the political offensive is combined with armed struggle and economic struggle to combat the looting of grain by a few bandits and puppets, strictly crack down on smuggling, and protect the vital interests of the masses.

Thirdly, the methods are diverse. In addition to the above, there are also releasing prisoners, using defectors to disintegrate the enemy, shouting slogans at the besieged points, rooftop broadcasting, government posting notices, relatives and friends sending messages and letters, etc. They are applied separately according to different regions and different situations. In new areas where the masses dare not meet me, rooftop broadcasts are used to publicize to the masses. Planned and focused public release of prisoners and repatriation of defectors provides the masses with living facts to see, and its propaganda effect is even greater.

After the above efforts, the achievements of the political offensive in the Jinzhong First Military Subdistrict are: The masses in the new area have a more correct understanding of me, more people are closer to our army, and the idea of changing the world is gradually being eliminated. Yan's soldiers also gradually have a better understanding of me. Therefore, the number of Yan's soldiers who have recently escaped to our area is increasing day by day. According to statistics from 128 villages in 10 districts of Yangqu, Shouyang, and Yuci counties, nearly 1,725 enemy troops have been disintegrated in the past month, including Zhang Shoufang, commander of the 2nd Regiment of the enemy's 8th Column, two captains of the People's Defense Army, and one deputy platoon leader. In addition, there were 144 puppet cadres and 1,959 escaped households. Yangqu Districts 1, 2, and 4 won over 372 enemy regular troops, 481 members of the People's Defense Army, 174 puppet cadres, and 275 escaped households. This number of escapes is now increasing day by day, and is gradually changing from scattered to collective. (Xing Ru)

　　太原外围各地政攻获得成绩
    月来瓦解敌近两千
    敌军逃亡人数日多并由零散变为集体
    【晋中讯】晋中战役以来，阎匪收集其残兵败将，困守太原孤城，图做最后的挣扎。但是他的士兵们都已感到阎锡山最后灭亡的命运即将到来。再加生活上每天挨饿（正规军每餐规定新秤十三两白面，实际除克扣外，只能吃到老秤半斤），没盐、没菜，情绪极其低落，普遍想回家、谋逃跑，或盼望解放军去解放他们；但因阎贼的欺骗宣传与特务统治也有些人不了解我们，不少阎军士兵虽有逃跑投我思想，但不能毅然行动。对我之宽大政策尚有疑惑。
    我们开展政治攻势时，首先是广泛深入的宣传与正确的执行宽大政策。普遍召开群众大会，宣传形势，解释我之宽大政策；开伪属座谈会，从他们的切身利益和形势中指出他们的前途，拿具体事实解除他们的怀疑，揭破敌人的一切欺骗宣传，启发他们设法从阎军中收回自己的亲人。在具体问题的处理上，真正掌握“胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的宽大精神。如阳曲一区东万寿村，张双子是敌民卫军士兵，敌人强派他回村要粮，侦察我方情形，为我查获，经解释宽大政策后，当即坦白承认，并痛述阎军罪恶，保证今后再不做任何不利于人民的事情。后即带回本村当众释放。在这影响下，该村有多时隐蔽在家不敢露面的三个民卫军出来见了我们，群众也把村中所有未回来的伪匪人员一一告我，并经过他们想办法叫回来了大半。
    其次是党政军民全体动员，协同动作，一致在围困太原，消灭阎匪的目标下进行工作，前方调查敌军具体情况与后方寻找社会关系相结合。凡逃亡归来者，村民对之一视同仁，不但不加歧视，并设法安置生活，这样就造成妻唤夫、母叫子的群众性规劝运动。另外是政攻与武装斗争经济斗争相结合，打击少数匪伪的抢粮，严缉走私，保卫群众的切身利益。
    其三，方法是多种多样的。除上述外，还有释放俘虏，利用投诚者进行瓦解，围点喊话，屋顶广播，政府张贴布告，亲友捎话、写信等。根据不同地区不同情况分别应用。在新区群众还不敢见我的地方，利用屋顶广播对群众进行宣传。有计划有重点的当众释俘，遣送投诚，给群众以活的事实看，其宣传作用更大。
    晋中一分区政治攻势经过如上的努力，所获成绩是：新区群众大部对我有了较正确认识，更多人对我军亲近了，变天思想也在逐渐消除。阎军士兵也逐渐的对我有了更多的了解。因此阎军最近逃来我区者日多一日。据阳曲、寿阳、榆次三县十个区一百二十八个村统计，月来瓦解敌军共一千七百二十五名，内有敌八纵队二团团长张寿芳，民卫军两个大队长，一个副中队长。另有伪干部一百四十四人，逃亡户一千九百五十九人。阳曲一、二、四区争取敌正规军三百七十二人，民卫军四百八十一人，伪干部一百七十四人，逃亡户二百七十五户。这种逃亡人数现在是一天比一天多，并且由零散的逐渐变为集体的。（星如）
