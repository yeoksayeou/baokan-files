From our North China Liberated Area to the Northeast Liberated Area, there is a very narrow road along the coast. The Chiang bandits rely on this road to transport military supplies and troops from inside the customs to the Northeast. The largest city on this road is Jinzhou. The People's Liberation Army captured this city after fighting for a day and a night. None of the 100,000 enemy soldiers in the city escaped; those who weren't killed were taken as prisoners. The enemy trapped in Shenyang and Changchun now have their escape routes completely blocked by us.

Several army corps of the North China People's Liberation Army are also winning victories. On October 5th and 6th, they eliminated two divisions of Yan Xishan's troops south of Taiyuan. Now they have advanced very close to the city, occupying the airport south of the city, and important locations 30 miles from the city in the northeast and southeast. In Suiyuan Province, they captured several large cities including Jining and Fengzhen, eliminating 5,000 of Fu Zuoyi's troops; in Chahar, they eliminated two regiments of Fu Zuoyi's troops and captured several county towns near Zhangjiakou. In Central Hebei, after eliminating more than 2,000 of Wang Fenggang's troops, we also occupied Gu'an and Xushui.

After capturing Jinan and eliminating 100,000 enemy soldiers, Shandong has also recovered several large places in recent days, including Yantai, Heze, and Linyi.

On October 6th and 7th, the Northwest People's Liberation Army eliminated two enemy divisions in the plains west of the Yellow River and south of the Huanglong Mountains. From the 10th to the 13th, they eliminated another 7,000 enemy soldiers.

　　解放军全国打胜仗
    供黑板报和屋顶广播用
    从咱华北解放区到东北解放区，靠着海边有很窄一条路，蒋匪就靠这条路从关内往关东运送军火、军队，在这条路上有一个最大的城就是锦州。解放军打了一天一夜就把这个城打下来了，城里十万敌人没一个跑掉，没打死的都当了俘虏。困在沈阳、长春的敌人，这一下连逃跑的路也叫咱堵死了。
    华北解放军几个兵团也都在打胜仗，十月五号六号在太原以南又消灭阎锡山两个师，现在又打到了离城很近的地方，占了城南的飞机场，城东北、东南也都占了离城三十里的重要地点。在绥远省打下了集宁丰镇几个大城，消灭傅作义五千人；在察哈尔消灭傅作义两个团，占了张家口旁边几个县城。在冀中消灭王凤岗两千多人以后，咱又占了固安、徐水。
    山东打下济南消灭十万敌人之后，这些天又收复了烟台、菏泽、临沂几个大地方。　
    西北解放军在黄河西边黄龙山南的平川十月六号、七号消灭了敌人两个师，十号到十三号又消灭了七千敌人。
