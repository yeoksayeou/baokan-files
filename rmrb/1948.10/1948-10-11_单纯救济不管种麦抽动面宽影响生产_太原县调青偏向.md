(Jinzhong Electric) Taiyuan County, Jinzhong Second District, convened a district cadre meeting on September 19th to examine biases in the adjustment of green seedling (Qing Miao) work. After the county deployed the Qing Miao adjustment work on September 6th, county and district cadres went to the villages. As of September 19th, the Qing Miao adjustment work in 17 villages out of 131 villages in the new district's plains had been completed. Approximately 1,200 people in 472 households (statistics missing from one village) were allocated 1,177 mu of Qing Miao. Another 50-60 villages are in the process of Qing Miao adjustment. The result of the adjustment is that farmers who lost their land under the Yan Xishan bandit regime's "integration of soldiers and farmers" and land-deficient households have solved the problem of rations and seeds, engaged in labor production, and eliminated the phenomenon of hunger and death due to poverty. However, two biases occurred in the Qing Miao adjustment work: (1) A simple relief viewpoint, manifested in the fact that the villages that have solved the Qing Miao problem have not adjusted wheat land, abandoned the organizational leadership work for the masses to reclaim wasteland and plant wheat, resulting in the separation of Qing Miao adjustment from organizing production. Some villages only allocated Qing Miao to the lonely and widowed, while poor farmers with labor power who had difficulty in life did not receive Qing Miao, which is not in line with the general spirit of disaster relief through production. (2) Insufficient publicity and understanding of policies, manifested in some villages having too large a scope of Qing Miao adjustment, extracting Qing Miao that should not have been extracted, and allocating Qing Miao to people who should not have received it. In Liangjia Village, out of 120 households, 60 households had their Qing Miao extracted. Due to this erroneous bias, coupled with insufficient publicity of various policies, it caused panic among farmers, especially middle peasants, and reduced production enthusiasm. Middle peasants in Luoyang Village generally reflected: "It is enough to plant more than one mu of wheat (the average wheat land per person in the whole village is more than one mu), if you plant more, people will adjust it!" Wu Sanhuo, a middle peasant in Dongpu Village, even harvested unripe corn for fear of having his Qing Miao distributed. After review at the meeting, it was believed that the reason for the above biases was that the county leadership did not emphasize organizing production when deploying the Qing Miao adjustment work, and did not promptly correct it after discovering the above problems. Generally, district cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of the district party committee's instructions on "taking production as the main focus and linking it to solving the land problem." Therefore, the meeting decided that the villages where the Qing Miao allocation work was done wrongly must be corrected. The method is to conduct a thorough investigation, find out the cause of the errors, and then study correction methods with the farmers and Qing Miao allocation households. For example, if poor farmers are allocated Qing Miao that should not be adjusted, and have already eaten it, they no longer need to return it, and other Qing Miao from major traitors and bullies will be extracted to compensate. Also, because the Autumn Equinox has passed, the county committee has determined that the work in the next half month should focus on adjusting wheat land, organizing manpower and livestock, and helping farmers plant wheat, with Qing Miao adjustment as an auxiliary task. Villages where Qing Miao adjustment work cannot be completed before the autumn harvest should be determined to temporarily not adjust Qing Miao, and the adjustment of autumn grain should be carried out after the autumn harvest.

### 单纯救济不管种麦抽动面宽影响生产  太原县调青偏向

　　单纯救济不管种麦抽动面宽影响生产
    太原县调青偏向
    【晋中电】晋中二分区太原县，于九月十九日召开区干部会议，检查调剂青苗工作中的偏向。该县于九月六日布置调青工作后，县区干部即分头下乡，截至九月十九日止，全县新区平川一百卅一个村有十七个村的调青工作已告结束，四百七　二户农民（缺一个村的统计）约一千二百人左右分到青苗一千　百七十七亩；另有五六十个村子正在调青。调青的结果，使阎匪“兵农合一”下失去土地的农民和缺地户解决了口粮和种籽问题，从事于劳动生产，消灭了因生活贫困而流于饥饿死亡的现象。但在调青工作中，发生了两种偏向：（一）单纯救济观点，表现在以上解决了青苗的村子，没有调剂麦地，放弃了对群众开荒种麦的组织领导工作，致调青与组织生产脱节。有些村子只给孤寡调青，而有劳动力生活困难的贫苦农民却没分到青苗，这和生产救灾总的精神不符。（二）宣传和掌握政策不够，表现在有的村庄调青范围太大，不该抽的青苗抽了，不该分的人分到青苗。梁家庄一百二十来户，抽了六十户。由于这种错误偏向，加上我们对各种政策的宣传作得不够，引起农民特别是中农的恐慌，降低了生产情绪。洛阳村中农普遍反映：“种上一亩多麦子就行了（全村每人平均一亩多麦地），多了人家又调剂呀！”东蒲村中农吴三货因怕分了他的青苗，甚至将不熟的玉茭也收了。会上经过检讨，认为发生以上偏向的原因，是由于县领导上在布置调青工作时没强调组织生产，在发现上述问题后又没及时纠正，一般区干部则对区党委指示“以生产为主，联系解决土地问题的精神”体会掌握不够。因此，会议上决定分青工作做错了的村庄必须纠正；其方法是经过周密调查，找出错误原因，然后和农民分青户研究出纠正办法，如贫苦农民分到不应调剂的青苗，并已经吃了的可不再退出，另抽其他大奸霸的青苗设法补偿。又因秋分已过，县委会确定今后半个月的工作应以调剂麦地、组织人畜力、帮助农民种麦为主，附带进行调青，秋收前不可能完成调青工作的村庄，应确定暂不调青，待秋收后再进行调剂秋粮。
