Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: The Inner Mongolia Hulunbuir League's Ganzhuur Temple "Nadam" Conference, with a history of 163 years and traditionally a feudal gathering, was transformed this year under the leadership of the CCP Inner Mongolia Hulunbuir League Party Working Committee into a gathering for widely promoting the CCP's various policies and boosting grassland trade. The conference began on the first day of the eighth lunar month and lasted for six days. More than 10,000 people from across the league arrived in camel carts, ox carts, and herds of horses and sheep. Party, government, military organs, schools, and mass organizations from Hulunbuir League and various banners also came to participate. The area around the venue, extending over ten li, was densely packed with 370 yurts, over 2,700 carts, and over 2,100 horses. In the center of the venue, on the wooden frame of a large yurt, hung portraits of Chairman Mao, Yun Ze (Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government), Stalin, and Choibalsan (Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic). During the conference, various gathering forms, such as youth meetings, mass forums, army-civilian get-togethers, and conferences rewarding model child-bearers and wolf-killers, as well as wrestling, equestrian, and archery competitions, were used to promote policies on prosperity of both people and livestock in pastoral areas, livestock breeding, encouraging child-bearing, medical and health, and army-civilian relations.

On the opening day of the conference, Comrade Ji Yatai, representative of the Hulunbuir League CCP Working Committee, attended and delivered a speech. He first pointed out that under the leadership of the CCP Inner Mongolia Party Working Committee and Chairman Yun Ze, Hulunbuir League has presented a brand-new outlook. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government has implemented democratic reforms, abolished exorbitant taxes and levies, and reduced the burden on the people. This spring, the government allocated 97 million yuan for livestock disease prevention and treatment, vaccinating 50,000 cattle, thus preventing the plague. In May of this year, the government launched a wolf-hunting campaign, killing a total of 578 wolves, reducing livestock losses. The government has established a hospital in each of the four grassland banners. Previously, there was not a single school in the entire grassland; now there are 46 primary schools and two middle schools. The Inner Mongolia Publishing House in Hailar published more than 36,000 books this year. The Trade Bureau has established six offices in the four banners to supply the grassland people with daily necessities and help them sell local products. Comrade Ji Yatai emphasized that prosperity of both people and livestock is the foundation of all work in Hulunbuir League. The Party and the government should help the smallest and economically backward nomadic ethnic groups in the league, such as the Oroqen and Zang Kuote, to improve their lives. Hulunbuir League is a purely pastoral area, and land cannot be divided equally as in agricultural areas, nor can livestock be divided equally. The general policy is to breed livestock, increase production, appropriately increase wages for herdsmen under conditions that benefit both herdsmen and herdowners, and improve grazing systems. At the same time, feudal privileges and the slave system should be abolished, and democratic reforms should be implemented step by step. Comrade Ji Yatai continued, "To achieve prosperity for both people and livestock, we must also pay close attention to the health care and infant care of all people in the league. All cultural and educational organizations and publishing institutions should greatly publicize health care work. In addition, all people in the league should pay attention to protecting the grasslands, improving livestock breeding methods, and working hard to harvest grass and dig wells, and improve livestock breeds. Each banner should also focus on piloting people's cooperatives to supply people's daily necessities and purchase grassland products, livestock, and their by-products. Finally, Comrade Ji Yatai called on all revolutionary workers in the league to closely connect with the masses, mobilize male and female herdsmen, and strive to actively build a new Hulunbuir."

　　内蒙呼伦贝尔盟“那达慕”大会
  　宣传我党对游牧区政策
  　强调人畜两旺繁荣草原贸易
    【新华社东北十八日电】具有一百六十三年历史的向为封建集会的内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟甘珠尔庙“那达慕”大会，今年在中共内蒙古呼盟党工委领导下，改变成为广泛宣传中共的各种政策，繁荣草原贸易的集会。大会自夏历八月初一起，历时六天，全盟有万余群众赶着骆驼车、牛车、马羊畜群前来赴会。呼盟及各旗党政军机关、学校、群众团体也都赶往参加。会场周围十余里，密布了三百七十座蒙古包、二千七百余辆车和二千一百余匹马。会场正中大蒙古包木架上，悬挂着毛主席、云泽（内蒙自治政府主席）和斯大林、却依巴桑（蒙古人民共和国总理）的肖像。大会期间，通过各种集会形式，如青年会、群众座谈会、军民联欢会、奖励生育模范、打狼模范的大会，及摔角、骑术、射箭比赛等，宣传了游牧区人畜两旺、繁殖牲畜、奖励生育、医药卫生、军民关系等政策。
    大会开幕日，呼盟中共工委代表吉雅泰同志曾莅会致词。他首先指出：在中共内蒙古共产党工作委员会及云泽主席的领导下，呼伦贝尔盟已呈现了崭新的面貌，内蒙自治政府实行民主改革，取消苛捐杂税，减轻了人民负担。今春政府曾拨款九千七百万元进行了牲畜的防疫与治疗，给五万头牛注射了防疫血清，免除了瘟牛。今年五月，政府发动了捕狼运动，共打死狼五百七十八只，减少了牲畜的损失。政府在草地四旗每旗都成立了一所医院。从前整个草原没有一所学校，现在已有小学四十六所，中学两所。海拉尔的内蒙出版社今年出版了三万六千余册书籍。贸易局为供给草地人民生活必需品及帮助人民销售土产，在四旗设立了六个办事处。吉雅泰同志强调：人畜两旺是呼盟一切工作的基础。党与政府要帮助盟境内人数最少、经济上又较落后的游牧民族如鄂伦春涨库特等改善生活。呼盟是纯游牧区，不能象农业地区平分土地，也不是平分牲畜。总方针是繁殖牲畜，增加生产，在牧民牧王两利条件下适当地提高牧工工资，改善牧放制度。同时废除封建特权，废除奴隶制度，有步骤地实行民主改革。吉雅泰同志继称：要做到人畜两旺，还必须切实注意全盟人民的卫生保健和育婴，各文化教育团体及出版机关应大大宣传卫生保健工作。此外，全盟人民应注意保护草原，改良牧畜方法，努力打草打井，改良畜种。各旗并应有重点地试办人民合作社，供应人民生活必需品，收购草地土产、牧畜及其副产品。最后，吉雅泰同志号召全盟所有革命工作人员要密切联系群众，发动男女牧民，为积极建设新呼伦贝尔而努力。
