　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 21st—The Mongolian people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of the Ikh Juu League in Sui Province are currently suffering endless harm from the Chiang, Fu, and Ma bandit gangs, who are seizing pastures and plundering livestock and property. The vast pastures between the Uxin Banner, Hanggin Banner, and Otog Banner southwest of the Mausoleum of Genghis Khan have been gradually annexed by the Taolimin Office (equivalent to a county government) established by Fu Zuoyi. The grasslands of the Dala Banner were also forcibly annexed by Fu's Dala Banner Training Office. Ma Hongkui of Ningxia established the Woye Administration Bureau in the area on the east bank of the Yellow River adjacent to Ningxia, encroaching on the fertile滩地along the Yellow River in Otog Banner. The grasslands in the Zhasake Banner and Uxin Banner areas in the southeastern part of the Ikh Juu League were occupied and reclaimed by Chen Changjie, the former commander of the Ikh Juu League Garrison appointed by Chiang Kai-shek after 1942. As a result of such annexation and occupation, the grasslands of the Mongolian people have been shrinking, animal husbandry has been declining, and it is rare to see flocks of more than 500 sheep or herds of 100 to 200 cattle and horses on the grasslands. The bandit gangs have carried out疯狂plunder of the Mongolian people's property. Last year, Fu Zuoyi forcibly requisitioned as many as 20,000 five-foot-long cowhides from Uxin Banner alone. Ma Hongkui's troops slaughtered more than 3,180 Mongolian people's耕牛and 2,650 sheep in Xinmiaoliang and other places, and plundered a large amount of property. When Chen Changjie was in the Ikh Juu League, he shot and killed Qi Guoxian, the deputy coordinator of West Uxin Banner, in the Sha Wangfu of Zhasake Banner, and forcibly requisitioned military rations, horses, etc., arousing the Mongolian princes and people to arm themselves and surround the Sha Wangfu, killing Chiang's senior special agents. Fu Zuoyi sent the 7th Cavalry Division under Men Bingyue to suppress them, looting all the property stored by the Mongolian princes for 200 years. In addition to looting and suppressing, Fu Zuoyi also divided the Mongolian princes, causing them to fight each other, and then seized power when the Mongolians were both defeated. For example, he supported Qi Yushan as the garrison commander in Uxin Banner, provoking mutual残杀between East and West Uxin Banners. Under Fu Zuoyi's instigation, Qi Zixiang of Jungar Banner was incompatible with Qi Wenying, the coordinator of the banner. On March 17, 1946, Qi Zixiang assassinated Qi Wenying. Fu Zuoyi then sent troops to suppress them under the pretext, dismissing Qi Zixiang and disarming his troops, taking the opportunity to order his confidant Chen Yujia to establish a temporary rehabilitation committee in Jungar Banner. Fu Zuoyi even drove the Mongolian people to be cannon fodder for his civil war. This spring, he forced Qi Yongquan's troops from Jungar Banner to invade the Shenmu and Fugou liberated areas in northern Shaanxi, where they were歼灭性 struck by the People's Liberation Army. Qi Yushan's troops in Uxin Banner were completely annihilated in the Suimeng Campaign at the end of September. Qi himself was treated leniently by the People's Liberation Army after being captured and arrived at a certain rear area on the 2nd of this month.

　　蒋、傅、马匪帮
  　残害绥境伊盟蒙人
    【新华社晋绥二十一日电】绥境伊克昭盟国民党统治区蒙族人民现正遭受蒋、傅、马匪帮兼并牧场、劫掠牲畜财物的无穷侵害。成吉思汗陵墓西南乌审旗、杭锦旗及鄂托克旗之间的广大牧场，已被傅作义设立的桃力民办事处（相当于县政府）逐步并吞。达拉旗的草地亦被傅匪的达拉旗组训处强行兼并。宁夏马鸿达则在毗连宁夏的黄河东岸地区，成立沃野设治局，侵占鄂托克旗沿黄河的肥沃滩地，伊盟东南部扎萨克旗及乌审旗地区的草原，则于一九四二年以后即被蒋介石委派的前任伊盟守备司令陈长捷霸占开垦。这样兼并霸占的结果，蒙民的草地日益缩小，畜牧业日趋衰落，草原上已看不到五百只以上的羊群和一、二百以上的牛马群。匪帮对蒙民财物进行疯狂的掠夺，傅作义去年向乌审旗一地强征五尺长的牛皮即达两万张。马鸿逵部在新庙梁等地，即杀蒙民耕牛三千一百八十余头，羊二千六百五十只，并掠取巨量财物。陈长捷在伊盟时，曾在扎萨克旗的沙王府枪毙乌审旗西协理奇国贤，强征军粮、马匹等，激起蒙古王公及人民武装包围沙王府，杀死了蒋匪高级特务人员。傅作义派骑七师门炳岳部前往镇压，将蒙古王公二百年来储藏的财物抢劫一空。傅作义除抢掠镇压外，并分化蒙古王公，使其火并，在蒙人两败俱伤后则乘机夺取政权。如在乌旗扶植奇玉山为警备司令，挑拨东西乌旗互相残杀。准格旗奇子祥在傅作义唆使下，与该旗协理奇文英互不相容，一九四六年三月十七日奇子祥刺杀奇文英，傅作义复借口派兵镇压，将奇子祥撤职，所部缴械，乘机令其亲信陈玉甲到准旗成立临时善后委员会。傅作义更驱使蒙人替他当内战炮灰，今春迫使准格尔旗的奇涌泉部，进犯陕北神木、府谷解放区，遭到解放军歼灭性打击。乌旗奇玉山部已于九月底绥蒙战役中全部被歼。奇本人被俘后受解放军宽待，已于本月二日抵后方某地。
