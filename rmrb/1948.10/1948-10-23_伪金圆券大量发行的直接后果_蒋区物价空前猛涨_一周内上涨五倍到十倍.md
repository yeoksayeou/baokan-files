Comprehensive reports from foreign news agencies: Prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have begun to rise sharply again, with a surge of unprecedented record. This is a direct consequence of the ever-increasing issuance of counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates. According to a United Press report on the 15th, the price of flour in Peiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao rose from eight yuan (counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates, same below) to fifty yuan per bag in one week. According to Associated Press reports on the 9th and 12th, in Peiping, coal rose from the limited price of 30 yuan to 150 yuan; other items such as rice increased fivefold over the limited price, eggs increased fivefold, oil increased eightfold, sugar increased tenfold, and pork increased tenfold. In Shanghai, "semi-official prices (referring to officially condoned black market prices)" for all goods were "100 to 200 percent higher than official prices." United Press revealed that the Nanjing puppet Legislative Yuan admitted in a secret meeting that "the resurgence of price fluctuations and black market activities has created a state of nervous tension and abnormality among the people."
