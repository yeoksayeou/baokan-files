　　The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
　　Published in "Pravda" on September 8, 1948
　　The Information Bureau of the Communist Parties of Several Countries in Europe, in its well-known resolution "On the Situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia," adopted in June 1948, pointed out: In recent months, nationalist elements, previously concealed, have dominated the leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party; the leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party has deviated from the internationalist tradition of the Yugoslav Communist Party and begun to take the path of nationalism.
　　The entire camp of Communist parties, People's Democracies, and Socialism in various countries has unanimously endorsed the Information Bureau's resolution "On the Situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia." Communist parties around the world believe that the current leadership of Yugoslavia, that is, the leadership of the Tito group, has, because of its nationalist policies, facilitated imperialism and isolated and weakened Yugoslavia.
　　Has the Tito group learned the lessons it should have from these facts?
　　Does the Tito group understand that its nationalist policies have resulted in Yugoslavia losing its most reliable allies—the Communist parties of the world—and that this situation has isolated and weakened the Yugoslav Communist Party at home and abroad?
　　Does the Tito group understand that the only way out of the serious situation it (the Tito group—translator) has driven the party and the country into is to admit its mistakes, abandon nationalism, and return to the family of Communist parties?
　　No, the Tito group has not learned the lessons it should have, and we do not see that they have understood these simple and easy-to-understand things.
　　On the contrary, the Tito group, using Belgrade's newspapers as its mouthpiece, has responded to the fraternal and comradely criticism from the brotherly Communist parties and the entire New Democratic and Socialist camp with obscene curses. It has incited national animosity against the people of neighboring democratic countries, and carried out widespread suppression, arrests, and killings of Communist and non-Communist Party members who dared to express doubts about the correctness of the Tito group's nationalist policies. Not long ago, Comrade A. Jovanović, a hero of the National Liberation War of Yugoslavia, chief of staff during the liberation movement, and principal of the Supreme Military Academy, was murdered by agents of Tito's henchman, the notorious Ranković. He was murdered because he had doubts about the correctness of the Tito group's nationalist and terror policies. Because of this, in Yugoslavia, people have openly said: "The Tito group is degenerating into a group of political assassins."
　　As is well known, the Tito group is not prepared to admit and correct its mistakes. More precisely, they are afraid and do not have the courage to admit their mistakes, because admitting and correcting their mistakes requires courage. Worse, they "panic-strickenly" arrest and suppress anyone who dares to talk about their mistakes.
　　Lenin said:
　　"The attitude of a political party toward its own mistakes is one of the most important and reliable criteria for judging how earnest the party is and how it fulfills, in practice, its obligations toward its class and toward the toiling masses. To admit a mistake openly, to disclose its reasons, to analyse the conditions which gave rise to it, to discuss carefully the means of correcting it—that is the earmark of a serious party; that is how it should perform its duties, and how it should educate and train the class, and then the masses."
　　Clearly, the Tito group can in no way be the kind of brave, honest, and party-loving leaders that Lenin spoke of.
　　The Tito group's main nationalist betrayal occurred in the period before the meeting of the Information Bureau of the Communist Parties of Several Countries in Europe in the spring of 1948. The Tito group began its open nationalist policy by refusing to attend the meeting of the Communist Information Bureau and refusing to discuss the situation of the Yugoslav Communist Party with the brotherly parties. Although it was repeatedly suggested that the Yugoslav Communist Party send its own delegation to the meeting and express its views at the meeting, as other Communist parties of several countries had done in previous sessions, the Tito group resolutely refused to participate in the work of the meeting. It is now very clear that the Tito group does not value friendship with the Communist parties, including the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This is an act of openly breaking away from the international united front of the Communist parties. This is an act of breaking away from internationalism and taking the path of nationalism.
　　Belgrade's "Borba" arbitrarily says that Tito and his followers uphold the anti-imperialist united front. This is, of course, a lie intended to deceive the "common people." In fact, it, this Tito group, cannot even live in harmony with the Communist parties of neighboring countries in one family. What anti-imperialist stance can it talk about?
　　The second important fact of the Tito group's nationalist betrayal is the group's shameful, hypocritical, and anti-Leninist behavior at the Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party. Simple people expected that the congress would proceed under the banner of friendship with the Communist parties and under the banner of consolidating the anti-imperialist front of the New Democratic countries and the Soviet Union. However, in reality, the result was completely the opposite. In reality, the Tito group has turned the congress into a stage for fighting against the Communist parties of neighboring countries, into a stage for fighting against the anti-imperialist united front of the New Democratic countries. This was a congress that "denounced" the New Democratic countries and their Communist parties, and "denounced" the Soviet Union and its Communist Party.
　　Of course, openly "denouncing" the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries is not very safe in Yugoslavia, because the people of Yugoslavia firmly support the alliance with the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. Therefore, the Tito group flaunted its cheap trick, deciding to cover up its reactionary "denunciation" with magnificent and beautiful words, such as loving the Soviet Union, friendship with the Soviet Union, the great role of the Soviet Union in the liberation movement, etc. Things developed to the point where even Tito's followers suggested that Stalin participate in this shameless "denunciation" and protect the Tito nationalist group from the criticism of the Communist parties of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. The editors of Belgrade's newspapers played all kinds of tricks and conspiracies, flaunting the most fantastic and ridiculous jumps and somersaults of performers, in order to prove to the people of the country that black is white, and white is black, that the Tito group's "denunciation" of socialism and the New Democratic countries is a minor matter, and that "alliance" with the Soviet Union and forming a "united front" with it is what the Tito group is extremely concerned about. In fact, the Tito group has recently begun to be in the same camp as the imperialists, slandering the Communist parties of the New Democratic countries and the Soviet Union—in order to please the imperialists of various countries. They do not want to establish a united front with the Communist parties of various countries, but want to establish a united front with the imperialists. The Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party approved and ratified the Tito group's nationalist policies.
　　The political peddlers of "Borba" demand that the Communist parties of various countries stop exposing the Tito group's mistakes, and demand that the Communist parties of various countries trust and support this group, otherwise this "movement" against the Tito group will cause serious damage to Yugoslavia.
　　No, gentlemen! The Communist parties cannot trust or support the Tito group's nationalist policies. It is entirely possible that this situation will bring losses to Yugoslavia. But this cannot be blamed on the Communist parties of various countries, but should be blamed on the Tito nationalist group, which has broken off relations with the Communist parties of various countries and declared war on them.
　　The political peddlers of "Borba" should understand that Marxism and nationalism are incompatible; nationalism, as a bourgeois ideology, is the enemy of Marxism. They must understand that Marxism-Leninism cannot compromise with nationalism, or with nationalist tendencies within the Communist Party. For the sake of the interests of the laborers, for the freedom and friendship of all nationalities, and for the victorious construction of socialism, it is necessary to smash nationalism—no matter what guise the nationalists wear.
　　Lenin said:
　　"Bourgeois nationalism and proletarian internationalism—these are the two irreconcilably hostile slogans that correspond to the two great class camps throughout the capitalist world, and express the two policies (nay, the two world outlooks) in the national question."
　　Under the conditions where bourgeois political power has been overthrown, the exploiting classes and their agents are trying to use the poisonous weapon of nationalism to restore their old system.
　　Regarding this, Stalin said:
　　"The tendency of nationalism is to adapt the policy of the internationalism of the working class to the policy of bourgeois nationalism... The tendency of nationalism reflects the attempt of the bourgeoisie of its own nation to restore capitalism..."
　　The nationalism of the Yugoslav Communist Party not only strikes at the anti-imperialist general front, but also, first and foremost, strikes at the interests of Yugoslavia itself, at the national interests of the country, and at the interests of the Yugoslav Communist Party in domestic and foreign affairs.
　　In foreign affairs, the Tito group's nationalism leads to breaking away from the united front of the world's labor movement, causing Yugoslavia to lose its most reliable allies and isolating Yugoslavia itself. The Tito group's nationalism is disarming Yugoslavia in the face of foreign enemies.
　　In domestic affairs, the Tito group's nationalism is leading to a policy of peace between the exploiters and the exploited, a policy of "uniting" the exploiters and the exploited into a "nation's" united front, leading to a policy of breaking away from the class struggle, leading to the absurd fallacy that socialism can be built without class struggle and that the exploiters can peacefully embark on socialism—that is, leading to the weakening of the fighting spirit of the Yugoslav laborers. The Tito group's nationalism is disarming the laborers in the face of internal enemies.
　　A year ago, when the Tito group had not yet shown nationalist tendencies and was still cooperating with the brotherly parties, Yugoslavia relied on the help of its closest allies—the Communist parties of various countries—and confidently and bravely moved forward. This was the situation not long ago. However, since the Tito group embarked on the path of nationalism, the situation has changed dramatically. Since the Tito group broke away from the united front of the Communist parties and began to treat the New Democratic countries with arrogance and insolence, Yugoslavia has lost its most reliable allies and is isolated and helpless in the face of its internal and external enemies.
　　Such are the tragic consequences of the Tito group's nationalist policies.
　　The Tito group does not understand the truths that every Communist Party member should understand and be clear about. They do not understand this simple truth, namely, that under the conditions of the current international situation, the fraternal unity of the Communist parties of various countries, the mutual cooperation and friendship of the People's Democratic countries, and cooperation and friendship with the Soviet Union—are the main conditions for the rise and prosperity of the New Democratic countries on the socialist construction front, and the main guarantees for their national freedom and independence from imperialist strangulation.
　　The political peddlers of "Borba" then arbitrarily say: criticism of the Tito group's mistakes has turned into a movement against the Yugoslav Communist Party and the various nationalities of Yugoslavia.
　　This is certainly not true. There has never been any movement against the various nationalities of Yugoslavia, past or present. It would be a sin to carry out any movement against the various nationalities of Yugoslavia. The heroic feats of the people of Yugoslavia are well known to the world. At the same time, everyone also knows that the people of Yugoslavia firmly support the united front with the New Democratic countries and the Soviet Union. The people of Yugoslavia can in no way be held responsible for the Tito group's nationalist policies. We consider the people of Yugoslavia to be our reliable allies.
　　We have not carried out any movement against the entire Yugoslav Communist Party, either now or in the past. We know very well that the majority of the Yugoslav Communist Party firmly supports friendship with the Communist parties of other countries, and supports friendship with the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. The majority of the Yugoslav Communist Party members have internationalist traditions—there is no doubt about that. We also know that the majority of the Yugoslav Communist Party members do not approve of the Tito group's nationalist policies. We know that it is precisely for this reason that this majority is suffering the brutal suppression of the Tito group and its agents.
　　This "movement" is not against the various nationalities of Yugoslavia and the entire Yugoslav Communist Party, but against the Tito nationalist group. It is being carried out in order to help the Yugoslav Communist Party analyze the Tito group's mistakes and abolish the nationalist policies of the Yugoslav leadership.
　　Finally, the political peddlers of "Borba" insist that the Tito group is inseparable from the Yugoslav Communist Party and that it represents the majority of the Yugoslav Communist Party.
　　This is also not true. A year ago, the Tito group may have represented the majority of the Yugoslav Communist Party. But that was a year ago. Now, since it has left the Communist parties of various countries, since it has broken with all friendly neighboring republics, and since it has swam into the nationalist camp, the Tito group no longer represents the majority of the Yugoslav Communist Party. Now the Tito group is only a faction trusted by a minority in the party, and it is using the state apparatus to suppress the will of the majority of internationalists in the party. The Tito faction has cut itself off from its party because it has handed the party over to the executioner Ranković to take care of, because it has established a brutal system of terror in the party, and implemented suppression, mass arrests, and assassinations. In fact, the Tito faction is now at war with its own party. Only the blind cannot see this. Since the Tito faction has shown that it is powerless to maintain order in the party by ordinary democratic means and has to resort to large-scale suppression, it means that it has long lost the support of the majority of party members in the Yugoslav Communist Party.
　　The Tito faction only represents a minority in the Yugoslav Communist Party, and this minority is not based on trust within the party, but relies on the administrative and police organs of Yugoslavia.

　　南斯拉夫铁托集团的民族主义往何处去
  　联共党（布）中央委员会
  　载于一九四八年九月八日“真理报”
    欧洲几国共产党情报局在其一九四八年六月通过的“关于南斯拉夫共产党状况”这一众所周知的决议中指出说：近数月来，早先隐蔽着的民族主义分子，在南共的领导中占着优势；南共的领导脱离了南共国际主义的传统，而开始走上民族主义的道路。
    各国共产党、人民民主主义和社会主义的整个阵营，都同声一致赞成情报局“关于南斯拉夫共产党状况”的决议。世界各国共产党均认为：现在南斯拉夫的领导，即铁托集团的领导，已因其民族主义的政策，而便利了帝国主义，孤立并削弱了南斯拉夫。
    铁托集团是否从这些事实中领受了应有的教训呢？
    铁托集团是否了解：民族主义的政策业已招致南斯拉夫丧失最可靠的同盟者——世界各国共产党，这种情况业已使南共在国内和国外陷于孤立和削弱呢？
    铁托集团是否了解：要解脱它（铁托集团——译者）驱策党和国家陷入的严重状况的唯一出路，乃是承认自己的错误，放弃民族主义，并回到共产党的大家庭中来呢？
    没有，铁托集团并未领受到应有的教训，我们还看不见他们已经了解了这些简明易懂的事物。
    相反地，铁托集团利用贝尔格莱德的报纸作喉舌，对于各兄弟共产党，整个新民主和社会主义阵营给予铁托集团错误的公正的同志的批评，却报以猥亵的咒骂，并煽动对各邻民主国家人民的民族敌意，广泛的镇压、逮捕和枪杀敢于表示怀疑铁托集团民族政策正确性之共产党员和非共产党员。不久以前，南国解放战争的英雄、解放运动时期的参谋长、最高军事学校校长陆军上将Ａ·约万诺维奇同志，被铁托代理人，臭名昭彰的兰科维奇的特务所杀害。他之被杀害，为的是他怀疑过铁托集团民族主义政策和恐怖政策的正确性。为了这件事，在南斯拉夫，人们已公开说：“铁托集团正在蜕变为政治暗杀的集团”。
    如众所知，铁托集团并未准备承认和纠正自己的错误。更正确说：他们害怕和没有勇气承认错误，因为，要承认和纠正自己的错误，就需要有勇气。更坏的是他们“惊惶失措地”抓捕和镇压任何敢于谈论他们的错误的人。
    列宁说：
    “政党对于自己的错误所抱的态度，就是表明这个党是否郑重，是否真正执行自己对本阶级和劳动群众所负义务最重要最可靠的尺度之一，公开承认错误，揭露错误的原因，分析产生错误的环境，仔细讨论改正错误的方法——这才是郑重的党的标志，这才是党执行自己的义务，这才是教育和训练阶级，以至于群众”。
    很显然，铁托集团无论如何也不能是象列宁所说的，那种勇敢的正直的，和爱护自己党的领导者。
    铁托集团主要的民族主义叛逆行为，是发生在一九四八年春欧洲几国共产党情报局召开会议以前的时期，铁托集团从拒绝出席共产党情报局会议，拒绝与各兄弟党讨论南共状况问题起，便开始其公开的民族主义的政策。虽然曾屡次建议南共派遣自己的代表团参加会议，并象前届会上其它数国共产党一样，在会上表达自己的观点，但铁托集团断然拒绝参加会议工作。铁托集团并不重视与各共产党其中包括苏联共产党的友谊，是已很明白的了。这就是一种公开脱离共产党的国际统一战线的举动。这就是一种脱离国际主义而走上民族主义轨道的举动。
    贝尔格莱德“斗争报”武断说：铁托及其同道者拥护反帝统一战线。这当然是打算欺骗“老百姓”的谎言。实际上，它，这一铁托集团甚且不能与邻国共产党和睦共居于一个家庭里，还能谈得上什么反帝国主义的立场。
    铁托集团民族主义叛逆行为的第二个重要事实，便是该集团在南共第五次代表大会上的可耻的伪善的和反列宁主义行为。纯朴的人们期望：代表大会将在与各共产党友好的旗帜之下，在巩固新民主国家和苏联反帝阵线的旗帜之下进行工作。然而实际上，所得的结果却完全相反。实际上，铁托集团已把代表大会变为反对邻国共产党斗争的舞台，变为反对新民主国家反帝统一战线斗争的舞台。这是“声讨”新民主国家及其共产党，“声讨”苏联及其共产党的一次大会。
    当然，公开“声讨”苏联和新民主国家在南斯拉夫是不太安全的，因为南斯拉夫的人民坚决拥护与苏联及与新民主国家的联盟。因此，铁托集团卖弄其廉价的诡计，决定以堂皇美丽的言辞，如什么爱苏联，与苏友谊，苏联在解放运动中的伟大作用等等，以此掩饰其反动的“声讨”。事情发展到连铁托的同道者也建议斯大林参加这一无耻的“声讨”，并保护铁托民族主义集团免受苏联及诸新民主国家的共产党的批评。贝尔格莱德报纸的编辑先生耍弄了各种手段和阴谋诡计，卖弄了卖艺人的最奇幻和滑稽可笑的跳跃和翻筋斗，为的是便于向全国人民证明说：黑的就是白的，而白的也就是黑的，铁托集团的“声讨”社会主义和新民主国家，是次要的事情，而与苏“联盟”，与其结成“统一战线”，乃是铁托集团极其关怀的。其实：铁托集团近来已开始与帝国主义者处于同一阵营，诽谤诸新民主国家和苏联的共产党——以此迎合各国帝国主义者的欢心。他们不要与各国共产党建立统一战线，而要与帝国主义者建立统一战线。南共第五次代表大会赞同和批准了铁托集团的民族主义政策。
    “斗争报”的政治贩子们，要求各国共产党停止揭露铁托集团的错误，要求各国共产党信任和支持这一集团，不然则这一反铁托集团的“运动”，将予南国以严重的损害。
    不，老爷们！共产党是不能信任也不能支持铁托集团的民族主义政策的。这种情况给南国带来损失是完全可能的。但是这不能归咎于各国共产党，而是应归咎于与各国共产党绝交并向它们宣战的铁托民族主义集团。
    “斗争报”的政治贩子们应当懂得：马克思主义和民族主义是毫不相容的；作为资产阶级观念形态的民族主义，乃是马克思主义的敌人。他们必须懂得的：马克思——列宁主义是不能与民族主义，或与共产党内民族主义倾向妥协的。马列主义为着劳动者的利益，为着各民族的自由与友好，为着社会主义的胜利的建设，必需粉碎民族主义——不论穿着什么外衣的民族主义者。
    列宁说：
    “资产阶级的民族主义和无产阶级的国际主义，——这是适应整个资本主义世界的两个伟大的阶级阵营，以及表现两种政策（尤其是两种世界观）的两种不可调和的势不两立的口号”。
    在资产阶级政权已被推翻的条件下，剥削者阶级及其代理人正力图利用民族主义的有毒武器，以恢复其旧制度。
    关于这点，斯大林说道：
    “民族主义的倾向，就是使工人阶级国际主义的政策适应于资产阶级民族主义的政策……民族主义的倾向，反映出自己民族资产阶级之企图恢复资本主义……。”
    南共的民族主义不仅打击反帝总阵线，而且，首先是在内政和外交方面打击南斯拉夫本身的利益，打击南国的民族利益和南共的利益。
    在外交方面，铁托集团的民族主义导致脱离全世界劳动者革命运动的统一战线，使南国丧失最可靠的同盟者，使南国自己孤立。铁托集团的民族主义，在外敌面前解除着南国的武装。
    在内政方面，铁托集团的民族主义正在导向剥削者与被剥削者之间和平的政策，剥削者与被剥削者“联合”为一个“民族”统一战线的政策，导向脱离阶级斗争的政策，导向不需阶级斗争可以建成社会主义和剥削者可以和平走上社会主义这种荒谬怪论——即导致南国劳动者斗志的松懈。铁托集团的民族主义，在内部敌人面前解除着劳动者的武装。
    一年前，当铁托集团仍未表现民族主义的趋向，还与各兄弟党合作的时候，南斯拉夫依靠着自己最亲近的同盟者——各国共产党——之助，满怀信心地勇敢地向前迈进。这是既往不久的情形。然而，自从铁托集团走上民族主义的轨道以后，情况便起了急剧的变化。自从铁托集团脱离了共产党统一战线并开始傲慢不逊地对待诸新民主国家以后，南斯拉夫便丧失了自己最可靠的同盟者，而在其内外敌人面前孤立无助。
    铁托集团民族主义政策的可悲后果，就是如此。
    铁托集团不懂得每个共产党员都应懂得与明白的道理。他们不懂得这一浅显的真理，即在现代国际形势的条件下，各国共产党兄弟般的团结一致，各人民民主国家的互相合作和友好，与苏联的合作和友好，——乃是诸新民主国家在社会主义建设战线上上升与繁荣的主要条件，乃是它们民族自由和独立免遭帝国主义绞杀的主要保证。
    “斗争报”的政治贩子们接着又武断说：对铁托集团错误的批评，已变为一种反南共和反南斯拉夫各族人民的运动。
    这当然是不对的，过去和现在都没有进行过任何反南斯拉夫各族人民的运动。进行任何反南国各族人民的运动乃是罪过，南国人民的英雄功迹，已为世人所共知。同时大家也都知道，南国人民是坚决拥护与诸新民主国家及苏联的统一战线的。南国人民无论如何也不能对铁托集团民族主义政策负责。我们认为南斯拉夫人民是我们可靠的同盟者。
    我们现在和过去也都没有进行过任何反对整个南共的运动。我们知道得很清楚，南共的大多数皆坚决拥护与其它国家共产党的友好，拥护与苏联及其共产党的友好。南共大多数党员都有国际主义的传统，——这是无庸怀疑的。我们同样也知道，南共大多数党员都不赞成铁托集团的民族主义政策。我们知道，正是因为这种缘故，这大多数人才遭受着铁托集团及其特务们的残酷镇压。
    这一“运动”并不是反对南斯拉夫各族人民和整个南共，而是反对铁托的民族主义集团。它之所以进行，乃是为着帮助南共分析铁托集团的错误和取消南国领导的民族主义政策。
    最后，“斗争报”的政治贩子们硬说：铁托集团是和南共不可分割的，它乃代表南共的大多数。
    这同样是不对的。一年以前，铁托集团可能代表南共的大多数。但是这是一年以前的事。现在，自从它离开各国共产党以后，自从它与一切友邻共和国决裂以后，自从它游进民族主义阵营以后，铁托集团已经不是代表南共的大多数了。现在铁托集团是仅有党内少数人信任的流派，它利用了国家机构，来压迫党内大多数国际主义者的意志。铁托流派自绝于其党，因为它把党交给刽子手兰科维奇去看管，因为它在党内建立了残忍的恐怖制度，施行镇压，大量逮捕和刺杀。实际上铁托流派现时业已与自己的党处于战争的状态。只有瞎了眼的人才看不见这点。铁托流派既然表现得无能为力用一般的民主方式来维持党内的秩序，以及不得不求助于大规模的镇压手段，那么这就是说，它早已丧失了南共党内大多数党员的支持了。
    铁托流派仅代表南共党内的少数人，这少数人并不是基于党内的信任，而是依恃着南国的行政警察机构。
