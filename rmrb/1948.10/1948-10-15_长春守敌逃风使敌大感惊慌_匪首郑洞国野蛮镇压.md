Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: The enemy in Changchun fleeing has caused alarm among the enemy. Deserters report that bandit chief Zheng Dongguo is implementing the following brutal suppression methods: (1) Deserters, if caught, are immediately executed on the spot or buried alive. Any military and political personnel who approach within 30 meters of a sentry post will be shot without question. (2) Strengthening the secret service rule by secretly adding a "political instructor" to each squad to monitor the troops. (3) Implementing a joint responsibility system of three people per group. If one person escapes, the other two will be severely punished. If two people escape, the remaining person will be executed on the spot. If more than three people desert in each company, the company commander will be shot. (4) Each division will select several confidants or secret service personnel from among the officers to form a shock team, inspection team, and interception team, and anyone attempting to escape will be executed on the spot. (5) Collect soldiers' guns and symbols to prevent them from escaping with weapons. Rifles are bundled together and handed over to the squad leader, and machine guns are handed over to the platoon leader. Contrary to expectations, these bloody methods of the Changchun defenders have accelerated their internal collapse. The joint responsibility system has prompted officers and soldiers to flee collectively. For example, five soldiers from the Second Company of the First Regiment of the enemy's Fifty-second Division deserted with weapons, and the company commander also ran away that night. Such phenomena of soldiers escaping and officers following suit are extremely common. Many junior officers and soldiers are trying every means to find opportunities to escape, secretly asking the masses for escape routes and asking the masses to lead the way. Soldiers of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the enemy's Fifty-second Division burn incense and kowtow every night, praying for the People's Liberation Army to enter the city as soon as possible, believing that only in this way can they save their lives.

　　长春守敌逃风使敌大感惊慌
    匪首郑洞国野蛮镇压
    【新华社东北十四日电】长春守敌的逃风已使敌人感到惊慌。逃兵们报告匪首郑洞国正实行下列的野蛮的镇压办法：（一）逃兵若被抓回，一律就地枪决或活埋。所有军政人员，任何人走向哨卡三十公尺以外者，射杀勿论。（二）加强特务统治，每班秘密增设一“政训员”，暗中监视部队。（三）实行三人一小组的连坐法。一人逃跑，两人受重罚。两人逃跑，剩下的一人就地枪决。每连如有三人以上逃亡者，枪毙连长。（四）每师抽调长官亲信或特务人员若干，组成突击队、检查队、阻拦队，遇有企图逃跑者即就地枪决。（五）收存士兵枪支、符号，以免携械逃跑。步枪捆收一起交班长，机枪交排长。与预期相反，长春守敌这些血腥办法加速了其内部的崩溃。连坐法促使其官兵集体逃亡。例如敌五十二师一团二连有五个士兵携械逃跑，该连连长也就连夜跑了。类似这种士兵逃跑，官长跟着就跑的现象极为平常。许多下级官兵千方百计寻求逃跑机会，暗地里向群众询问逃跑办法，要求群众带路。敌五十二师二团二营士兵，每夜烧香叩头，祈祷解放军早日进城，他们确信只有这样，他们才能保住生命。
