　　Taihang Electric: According to a report from the Office of the First Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Committee recently inspected the situation in the experimental villages in Lincheng where land reform was completed before the autumn harvest. It was found that in the implementation of the land reform completion policy, the mistake of absolute egalitarianism was widespread. The County Committee's leadership exhibited an intolerable degree of bureaucracy. In the forty-one experimental villages where land reform was completed, the scope of land requisition was generally large, ranging from 30% to over 50% of the total households in the village. In Ji Village, out of 160 households, 32 middle-peasant households were wrongly struggled against in the past, and 8 landlord and rich peasant households were struggled against. This time, 52 households had their land requisitioned, which is even larger than the original scope of struggle. Those whose land was requisitioned were mostly new middle peasants, with the reason being "new middle peasants are easier to talk to than old middle peasants." Led by Party members to hand over land, the new middle peasants appeared to be willing on the surface, but in reality, they were all dissatisfied, which was tantamount to attacking the liberated peasants. The reasons for this error are: (1) The leadership did not base its actions on specific circumstances but carried out compensation and resettlement mechanically, excessively emphasizing that the middle peasants, landlords, and rich peasants who had been struggled against should all be compensated to the same level; the poor and hired peasants who lacked land were guaranteed to have land adjusted to them, regardless of the specific objects and conditions, and this was done uniformly without distinction, indicating that the County Committee's own absolute egalitarianism had not been resolved. (2) The County Committee never seriously and personally created models in a few villages to generate experience to guide the general work. It is said that the County Head worked in one village but did not create any "reputation." After the District Party Committee's August meeting, they still sat there complaining to the Prefectural Committee about the difficulty of resettlement and compensation, without going down to see. The first time they asked for 170,000 catties of interest-free grain, but after the Prefectural Committee pointed out that they should truly understand the situation, they then said they only needed 20,000 catties. (3) They did not seriously and carefully examine the land reform completion plans drawn up by the villages. They glanced at the plans sent by the villages and casually threw them aside. The County Committee and District Committee never collectively and seriously discussed a single village. The District Party Committee particularly emphasized this point at the August meeting. (4) They did not regard the completion of land reform as an extremely serious and responsible task. In completing the task, they disregarded the conditions of the cadres and arbitrarily entrusted some comrades without work experience to do it. In one village, a newly promoted comrade and three people, including a detective from the Public Security Bureau, were sent to do it, and the result was very bad. (5) In the implementation of land reform completion, they disregarded the establishment and use of people's representative conferences. In Lincheng's implementation of land reform completion, it generally went through village expanded cadre meetings or, on the basis of the original production committee, adding a few middle peasants to replace the functions of the people's representative conference. (6) Some villages spontaneously carried out land reform completion, such as in Dongxi Lengshui. When the county learned about it, they sent people to check and reported back saying, "The results are not bad." Not only did they not stop it, but they were also praised. The County Committee has long ignored the above problems. Only after the Prefectural Committee recently pointed them out did the County Committee abandon its plan to convene a county-wide expanded cadre meeting during the autumn harvest to deploy the comprehensive launch of land reform completion throughout the county. Now, the County Committee is dividing up to go deep into the lower levels to conduct inspections and make appropriate corrections.

　　临城结束土改发生严重错误
  　绝对平均群众不满
    【太行电】据一地委办公室报导，地委最近检查了临城秋前结束土改实验村的情况，发现在执行结束土改政策上，普遍犯了绝对平均主义的错误。县委领导上存在着难以令人忍受的官僚主义。四十一个土改结束实验村，土地抽动户的面普遍都很大，少者占全村百分之卅，多者到百分之五十以上。冀村全村一百六十户，过去错斗中农三十二户，被斗地主富农八户，这次抽动土地的户又有五十二户，较原来被斗面还要大，动的户都是新中农，理由是“新中农较老中农好说话”。在党员带领下往出拿地，表面新中农是自愿，实际都不满意，等于给了翻身户以打击。产生这种错误的原因：（一）领导上不根据具体情况，机械地进行补偿安置，过分的强调了被斗的中农地主富农都要补到一样水平；缺土地的贫雇，保证都要调剂到土地，不顾及具体的对象和条件，无分别的一律这样作，说明县委自己的绝对平均主义思想并未解决。（二）县委从没认真地亲自动手作几个村作出样子，创造经验指导一般。据说县长作了一个村，也没闹出一个“名堂”。区党委八月会议后，还坐在那里向地委叫安置补偿困难，不下去看看。第一次叫需要无利贷粮十七万斤，经地委指出让其真正了解一下情况，以后才又说只需二万斤。（三）没有认真地精心地审查各村订出的土改结束计划，将村子里送来的计划草草一看，往一边一掷，县委、区委从没集体认真讨论过一个村。区党委八月会议上对这点是特别强调了的。（四）没有将结束土改看作是一件极严肃负责的工作，在完成任务上不顾及干部条件，随意委托一些无工作经验的同志去作，有一个村是让新提拔出来的一个同志和公安局侦察员等三个人去搞，结果作的很糟。（五）执行结束土改中，漠视了人代会的建立与运用。在临城执行结束土改，一般都是经过村里扩干会议或在原生产委员会基础上再加上几个中农来代替人代会的职权。（六）有些村自发的进行结束土改，如东西冷水，县里知道了派人去检查，回来报告说：“成绩还不错”，不但没制止反受到表扬。上述这些问题长期为县委所漠视，待地委最近指出后，县委才放弃了准备在秋忙中召开全县扩干会议，布置全县全面展开结束土改的计划。现在县委才都分头深入下边进行检查，作适当的纠正。
