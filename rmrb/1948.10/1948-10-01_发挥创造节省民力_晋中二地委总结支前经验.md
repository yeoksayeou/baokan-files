(Jinzhong Electric Dispatch) The Second District Committee of Jinzhong recently summarized its experiences in supporting the front during the Jinzhong Campaign. It first pointed out the need for overall planning and precise calculation to achieve fair burden-sharing and save civilian labor. In the past, due to a lack of comprehensive data, unfair burdens arose between villages, districts, and between manpower and animal power in Wenxi County when allocating tasks. According to statistics from seven villages in the third district of the county, during the 45 days of supporting the front, each able-bodied person contributed an average of 2.8 workdays, while each livestock contributed an average of 10 workdays. In the sixth district, each person contributed an average of 3.5 workdays to support the front, while in the third district, each person contributed an average of 1.5 workdays. This imbalance must be overcome. Secondly, it is necessary to adopt new methods to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. For example, when the counties received the task of transporting railway sleepers, they estimated while sitting at home that each large cart could pull six sleepers; however, the masses used a rubber-wheeled cart to pull 25 sleepers. Originally, four people carried one sleeper, but the masses used a small cart to push two sleepers per person. In the 30-mile journey from JiaoCheng Mountain to Kaishan, after research and improvement, the water flow was used for rafting, with one person handling 20 sleepers, which could arrive in two days. Each sleeper earned three catties of white flour, and 60 catties could be earned in two days, benefiting both the public and private sectors. In the section from Kaishan to Fenyang, the original plan was for each cart to carry 600 catties, with a round trip taking four days. Later, by adopting a 12% profit-sharing system, each cart carried 2,500 catties, and the round trip took only two days, increasing the carrying capacity by more than four times and reducing the time by half. This transportation of more than 110 miles was faster and cheaper than the 80-mile transportation from Fenyang to Pingyao, which used the supply system.

　　发挥创造节省民力
    晋中二地委总结支前经验
    【晋中电】二地委顷总结晋中战役中支前工作经验，首先指出必须全盘计划，精确计算，以达到公平负担，节省民力。过去由于缺乏全面材料，文水县在分配任务中形成村与村、区与区、人力与畜力之间的负担不公。据该县三区七个村统计，四十五天支前中，平均每个全劳力出二点八个工，每个牲畜则平均出十个工弱。六区支前每人平均出工三个半，三区每人平均出工一个半。这种不平衡现象必须克服。其次，要采用新办法发扬群众的积极性与创造性。如各县在领受运输枕木任务时，坐在家里估计，每辆大车能拉六根；但群众却用一辆胶轮车拉二十五根。原四人抬一根，群众却一人用小车推二根。由交城山截岔沟运到开栅三十里途中，经研究改进，利用水流顺水漂伐，一人二十根，两日即可到达。每根赚三斤白面，两天可赚六十斤，公私两利。开栅至汾阳段，原计划每辆车载六百斤，来回四日。后采取百分之十二分红，每辆车拉二千五百斤，往返仅两日，载重量增四倍以上，费时缩减一半。这一百一十余里的运输，较之采用供给制之汾阳至平遥八十里运输既快又便宜。
