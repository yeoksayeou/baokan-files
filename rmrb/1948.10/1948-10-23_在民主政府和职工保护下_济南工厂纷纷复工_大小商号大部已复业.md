Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st—Factories, both public and private, in Jinan are resuming work one after another, and most shops have also reopened. The Jinan Flour Mill, formerly owned by the Chen family, one of the "Four Big Families," was protected by the People's Liberation Army and more than twenty employees of the factory. Its machinery, raw materials, and fuel were all intact. After being confiscated by the Military Control Commission, it resumed work on the third day after liberation. The three major private cotton mills, Chengtong, Renfeng, and Chengda, also resumed work successively before October 7. More than two hundred employees of the Renfeng Cotton Mill and more than one hundred and seventy workers of the Chengtong Cotton Mill, raised the slogan "As long as the factory is here, we have a rice bowl" during the fighting. They automatically organized factory protection committees or factory protection teams to guard the factory day and night, and with the timely dispatch of teams by the People's Liberation Army for protection, the machinery was undamaged, for which the owners were deeply moved. Maoxin Flour Company, which had been shut down for ten years, is currently temporarily managed by the Military Control Commission because the manager is not present, and is preparing to resume work. Once the manager of the factory returns, the factory will be returned to its original owner.
　　Most of the large and small businesses in Jinan have reopened. In the most prosperous commercial area from Jing'er Road to Wei'san Road to Wei'ba Road, eighty or ninety percent of the shops have opened. Business owners have expressed their gratitude to the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government for their policy of protecting industry and commerce. Currently, Huafeng, Baofeng, Chengji, and Huifeng flour mills, which was destroyed by fire, are actively preparing to resume work. Shops that were damaged by artillery fire or looted by the Kuomintang army are also renovating their fronts in preparation for reopening.

　　在民主政府和职工保护下
  　济南工厂纷纷复工
  　大小商号大部已复业
    【新华社济南廿一日电】济市各公私工厂正纷纷复工，商店也已大部复业。原四大家族之一——陈家所办的济南面粉厂，在解放军和该厂廿余职工的保护下，机器、原料、燃料均完好无损。经军管会没收后，业于解放后的第三日复工。成通、仁丰、成大等三大私营纱厂，也已于十月七日前先后复工。仁丰纱厂的二百余职工及成通纱厂的一百七十余工人在战斗时提出“有厂在就有饭碗在”口号，自动组织护厂委员会或护厂队日夜守护工厂，并得解放军及时派队保护，故机器均无损毁，业主对此深为感动。停工十年的茂新面粉公司，因经理不在，现暂由军管会代管，并筹备复工中。待该厂经理返回后，即将该厂交还原主。
    济市大小商号大部复业，最繁盛的商埠经二路纬三路至纬八路一带十之八九的商铺已开门。工商业主对解放军和民主政府保护工商业的政策均表感激。现华丰、宝丰、成记及遭火焚之惠丰等面粉厂，正积极筹备复工中。被炮火损坏或遭国民党军洗劫的商店，也正装修门面，准备重新开业。
