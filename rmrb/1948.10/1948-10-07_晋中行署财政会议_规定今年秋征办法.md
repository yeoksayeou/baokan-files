Jinzhong Administrative Office Fiscal Meeting
    Specifies Autumn Grain Collection Methods for This Year
    [Jinzhong Telegraph] The Jinzhong Administrative Office held a fiscal meeting in mid-month, which specified the following principles and methods for this year's autumn grain collection: (A) In old liberated areas where land has already been equally distributed and the feudal land relations have been eliminated, and in areas that have implemented land reform and our burden policies in the past, and where the enemy occupation period was very short and that are now liberated, the old liberated area burden methods of the North China People's Government can be adopted. (B) In areas where "soldiers and farmers are united" has been thoroughly implemented, a non-progressive burden method per mu is adopted. The situation in these areas is generally that the land of landlords and rich peasants has been largely dispersed, the land of middle peasants has increased, some of the poor and middle peasants occupy most of the land, and others have lost their land (those who lost their land after the "soldiers and farmers united" accounted for 30% to 40% of the households, of which the vast majority were poor and middle peasants; these people mostly rely on helping with farming for a living, and some rely on carrying burdens as vendors, while the lonely, elderly, weak, and disabled have become beggars). After liberation, after we implemented the land policy of "whoever cultivates it harvests it plus adjustment," every farmer obtained some land, and although there were differences in quantity and quality, the differences were not large. In order to take care of the interests of the peasants, under the principle of whoever cultivates it, harvests it, and bears the burden, a non-progressive collection method per mu is adopted. The specific method is to first convert all the land in the village into burden mu, with one mu of medium dry land, which is the most common in the village, as one burden mu, and other poor land is converted based on this standard. One mu of irrigated land is converted to two mu, one mu of lower irrigated land and upper dry land is converted to 1.2 mu, one mu of lower dry land and upper slope land is converted to 0.7 mu, one mu of lower slope land and sandy alkaline and lower mixed land is converted to 0.5 mu, and three mu of mountain land is converted to one mu. Then, the tax-exempt mu is deducted according to the population. Military personnel, cadres, and family members of revolutionary martyrs, or widowers, widows, the elderly, and the disabled with only two people in a household, are exempted from 1.5 burden mu per person. Households with three or more people up to ten people are exempted from one burden mu per person based on the actual population. Households with more than ten people are uniformly exempted from the tax-exempt mu per person. Then, the total amount of public grain to be borne by the village is evenly distributed among the total number of burden mu in the village. (C) In areas where we have not worked in the past, and where the Yan Faction has not implemented "soldiers and farmers united" or implemented it in a superficial way, a progressive method based on the average burden mu per person is adopted. In these areas, the feudal land relations are not as concentrated as before the War of Resistance, but the basic nature has not changed significantly, and there are large differences in the amount and quality of land occupied by various classes. In order to take care of the interests of the peasants and balance the burden of various classes, the above method is adopted. All the land in the village is uniformly converted into burden mu, and the conversion method is the same as above. The total burden mu of the village is divided by the total population of the village to obtain the number of burden mu per person. Based on this standard, those who are above or below this number will implement different progressive scoring methods. Those whose average burden mu per person is exactly equal to this standard mu will be scored one point per mu (burden mu, same below) for all the land they should burden after deducting the tax-exempt point. Those whose average is below but above 80% of the standard mu per person are scored at 0.8 points per mu (mu to be burdened, same below). Those above 60% are scored at 0.6 points. Those above 40% are scored at 0.4 points. Those above 20% are scored at 0.2 points. Those below 20% are scored at 0.1 points. Those whose average burden mu per person is above the standard mu, but does not exceed half of the standard mu, are scored at 1.2 points per mu. Those who exceed half but not more than one time the standard mu are scored at 1.4 points per mu. Those who exceed one time but not more than 1.5 times the standard mu are scored at 1.7 points per mu. Those who exceed 1.5 times but not more than two times the standard mu are scored at 2 points per mu. Those who exceed two times the standard mu are scored at 2.5 points per mu. After scoring, the public grain to be borne by the entire village is distributed according to the score. The meeting decided that new villages will not be charged additional village expenses, which will be managed by the county government in a unified way. Villages are not allowed to allocate any more grain or funds to prevent waste. In order to achieve a reasonable burden, the meeting also decided that the autumn and summer collections will be calculated together. Arable land, land where grain has been plundered by the enemy, and a small amount of land that has been grabbed and cultivated that the government has announced will not be burdened (approved by the county) can be exempted from the burden.

　　晋中行署财政会议
    规定今年秋征办法
    【晋中电】本月中旬，晋中行署财政会议规定今年秋征方针及办法如下：（甲）在土地业已平分，封建的土地关系业已消灭了的老区，及过去实行过土改，实行过我方负担政策，而敌占时期很短，今已解放的地区，均可采用华北人民政府的老区负担办法。（乙）在彻底实行了“兵农合一”地区，采取不累进的按亩负担办法。此种地区之情况，大体上是地主富农土地大部被分散，中农土地增加，贫中农中一部分人占有大部土地，另一部分人失掉了土地（“兵农合一”后失掉土地的占户口的百分之三十至四十，其中贫中农占绝大比重，这些人大多数靠助耕生活，一部分人靠挑担当小贩，孤独老弱则流为乞丐）。解放后，经我实行“谁种谁收外加调剂”的土地政策以后，农民每人都得到了一部分土地，数量质量虽有差别，但差别不大。为了照顾农民利益，在谁种谁收谁负担的原则下，采用不累进的按亩征收办法。具体的做法是先将全村土地一律折合为负担亩，以本村数量最多的中等旱地一亩为一负担亩，其他的坏地以此为标准进行折合。上水地一亩折二亩，下水地及上旱地一亩折一亩二分，下旱地及上坡地一亩折七分，下坡地及沙中碱、下混地每亩折五分，山地三亩折一亩，然后按人口扣除免征亩。一户只两口人的军、干、烈属或鳏寡孤独者，每人除一个半负担亩。每户三口人以上十口人以下者，按实有人口每人除一个负担亩。十口人以上者，一律按一口人除免征亩。再以全村负担亩数平均分配全村应负担之公粮数。（丙）在我们过去没有工作、阎匪也未实行“兵农合一”或明合暗不合的地区，采用以每人平均负担亩定分累进办法。此种地区，封建土地关系虽不如抗战以前集中，但基本性质无大变动，各阶层占有土地无论数量质量均差异很大。为了照顾农民利益，使各阶层负担平衡，故采用上述办法，将全村所有土地一律折合成负担亩，折合办法同上。以全村人口平均全村负担亩，求得每人负担亩数，以此为准，在此数以上或以下者，实行不同的累进计分办法。每人平均负担亩正合于此标准亩数者，则其全家扣除免征点后，所有应负担之地亩每亩计一分。每人平均在标准亩数以下又在标准亩十分之八以上者，每亩（应负担亩，下同）按八厘计。十分之六以上者，计六厘。十分之四以上者，计四厘。十分之二以上者，计二厘。十分之二以下者，计一厘。每人平均负担亩数在标准亩数以上，超过标准亩数半倍以下者，每亩计一分二厘。超过标准亩数半倍以上一倍以下者，每亩计一分四厘。超过一倍以上、一倍半以下者每亩计一分七厘。超过标准亩数一倍半以上、二倍以下者，每亩计二分。超过标准亩数二倍以上者，每亩计二分五厘。定分之后，即按分数分配全村应负担之公粮。会议决定新区村庄不另征收村开支，由县政府统筹掌握。村中不许再派任何粮款，以杜绝浪费现象。为求负担合理，会议并决定秋夏征一并计算，荒地、被敌人抢去粮食之土地及抢耕抢种政府宣布过不负担之少数土地（经县批准）均可不负担。
