Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 5th. The mass political offensive and suppression movement against bandits in the Western Henan liberated area has achieved significant results. In the Central Plains, especially in Western Henan, this is as important as annihilating the enemy's regular army. According to statistics published by the Western Henan Daily, from August 5th to September 15th, over a period of forty days, more than 1,300 bandits were persuaded to return home and resume their livelihoods; 250 were killed in combat, and 1,400 bandits were captured. Except for a few principal culprits and habitual bandits, such as Xi Ziyou and Jin Shaohua, who have been publicly tried and executed by the people's court, the remaining captives have been treated leniently. After the start of this movement, in addition to continuing to resolutely suppress the incorrigible habitual bandits militarily, politically, the masses were mobilized to explain to them the victorious situation and the determination of the democratic government to eliminate bandits, as well as the lenient policy of "the principal culprits must be punished, those who were coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," in order to disintegrate the bandit ranks. In the process of the movement, propaganda was carried out in a timely manner in conjunction with military victories, which was particularly effective. For example, after defeating a bandit squadron, the militia of a certain district in Yiyang then used opera performances, clapper talks, large meetings, forums for old ladies and old men, and forums for bandit family members to expose reactionary rumors and guarantee leniency for coerced elements, and allow perpetrators to atone for their crimes, greatly stabilizing the masses' emotions, and bandit family members went up the mountains to persuade their children and husbands to return home and return to the right path. In addition, our democratic government also cooperated with armed forces to go deep into the mountainous areas to establish political power. Xia Dian in Linru is located in deep mountains and dense forests, which has always been a den of bandits. After the democratic government established a district government in the area, the people had something to rely on and excitedly said, "Now we can sleep peacefully!" The district government then convened a mass meeting to mobilize the bandits, and within twelve days, sixty-two bandits returned to their hometowns to start new lives and careers.

　　豫西瓦解土匪已获宏效
    月余争取千余人还家
    【新华社中原五日电】豫西解放区对土匪展开群众性的政治攻势与清剿运动，已获宏效。这在中原特别是豫西，是与歼灭敌人正规军同等重要的大事。据豫西日报发表统计：自八月五日至九月十五日止，四十天内先后争取土匪回家安业者一千三百余人；战斗中击毙者二百五十余人，俘匪一千四百余人。其中除少数首恶惯匪如席子猷、靳绍华已经人民法庭公审枪决外，被俘余众均予宽大处理。此次运动开始后，除在军事上对怙恶不悛之惯匪继续坚决进剿外，政治上则发动群众，向他们说明胜利形势与民主政府肃清土匪决心以及“首恶必办、威从不问、立功受奖”的宽大政策，借以瓦解土匪队伍。在运动过程中及时结合军事胜利进行宣传，收效尤大。如宜阳某区民兵，在打垮土匪一个中队后，接着用唱戏、快板、开大会、开老太太老汉座谈会、土匪家属座谈会等，揭穿反动谣言，保证对胁从分子宽大，对作恶分子准其将功折罪，群众情绪大定，土匪家属纷纷上山觅劝子弟、丈夫回家归正。此外，我民主政府并配合武装深入山区建立政权。临汝夏店山深林密，向为土匪渊薮，此次民主政府在该地建立区政府后，人民有了依靠，都兴奋地说：“现在能安心睡觉啦！”区政府随即召开群众大会，动员争取土匪，十二天就有六十二个土匪回来自新安业。
