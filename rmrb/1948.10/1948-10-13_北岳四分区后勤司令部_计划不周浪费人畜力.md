Northern Yue Fourth Military Sub-district Logistics Command
    Poor Planning Results in Waste of Manpower and Animal Power
    On September 17, the Logistics Command of the Northern Yue Fourth Military Sub-district issued an order to the Logistics Command of Huolu County: to mobilize 200 carts to arrive in Yangquan City on the 24th to transport grain to a certain location, for a period of one month. As a result, when the carts arrived, there was no grain to transport, and they had to return empty. This caused 200 carts, 398 livestock, and 503 people to travel back and forth for eight days in vain, wasting 7,208 units of manpower and animal power, 38,200 catties of grass, 12,736 catties of feed, and 7,040 catties of rice. If one person can harvest one mu of crops per day, 503 people could have harvested 4,024 mu of crops in eight days; if one animal can plow two mu of land per day, 398 animals could have plowed 6,368 mu of land in eight days. We believe that the Fourth Military Sub-district Logistics Command's unorganized and unplanned work style is worth deep self-criticism. At the same time, we suggest that all logistics organs should make accurate calculations from all aspects based on the size of the task beforehand, and then execute it. They should not blindly and hastily issue orders and notifications, resulting in futile trips and waste of manpower and animal power.
   　Huolu County Committee Zhao Yingzhong　Gao Shanbao

    The Huolu County Committee's reflection of this opinion should be strictly examined by the Northern Yue Fourth Military Sub-district Logistics Command, and we hope they will make a public reply.

　　北岳四分区后勤司令部
    计划不周浪费人畜力
    北岳四分区后勤司令部，九月十七日给获鹿县后勤指挥部命令：调大车二百辆，廿四日赶到阳泉市往某地运粮，时间为一个月。结果大车到后无粮可运，只得空车返回，空让二百辆大车，三百九十八个牲口，五百零三个人往返八天，浪费人力畜力七千二百零八个，用草三万八千二百斤，料一万二千七百三十六斤，米七千零四十斤。如按一人一天割庄稼一亩计算，五百零三人八天可收割庄稼四千零二十四亩；以一个牲口一天耕二亩地计，三百九十八个牲口八天可耕地六千三百六十八亩。我们认为四分区后勤机关，这种无组织无计划的工作作风，是值得深刻检讨的。同时建议今后各用勤机关，在事前应根据任务的大小从各方面都做出精确的计算，然后再执行。不应盲目草率的下命令下通知，以致徒劳往返浪费人畜力。
   　获鹿县委会赵英忠　高山保
    获鹿县委会反映这个意见，北岳四分区后勤司令部应作严格检查并望公开作复。
