　　How to Combine Frost Prevention with Smudge Fertilization?
    Question: In the "Frost Prevention Methods" mentioned on the first page of the 83rd issue of the People's Daily, it says, "In areas lacking firewood, it can be combined with late autumn smudge fertilization." May I ask how late autumn smudge fertilization is done? How is it preserved? What is its effectiveness? I hope you can provide an answer for dissemination. (Guan Yunqing, Industrial Section, Zhao County Government)
    Answer: How to combine frost prevention with smudge fertilization depends on local conditions. If the masses have the habit of smudge fertilization, then use the smoke rising from the smudge to prevent frost. However, for frost prevention, the more smoke the better, but when smudge fertilizing, after the firewood is lit, it should be covered with soil immediately, so that the fire continues to burn without going out, while also preventing too much smoke from escaping. If the smoke spreads out too much, the smudged soil will not be as potent. Therefore, when smudge fertilizing, if you want to combine it with frost prevention, you need to first understand the wind direction. If the wind blows from east to west, you can place the smudge piles on the east side of the field; conversely, place them on the west side of the field. This way, the smoke from the smudge can be blown into the field by the wind. If the smoke is small, you can smudge several more piles. As for the method of smudge fertilization, there are many different methods in various places. One relatively simple method is to dig a "cross" ditch in the field. The length of the ditch depends on the amount of firewood, and the size of the pile is determined by this. The ditch should be half a foot to eight inches deep. At the intersection of the two ditches, dig a pot-shaped deep pit. Then, spread the firewood (or corn stalks, etc.) in the middle of the cross ditch, light it with fire, and press the soil on top of the firewood. However, do not block the four ventilation openings of the cross ditch, because the cross ditch has two intersecting trenches, and there is a pit in the middle. Even with soil piled on top, air can still circulate below, so the firewood can continue to burn for two or three days without going out. Soil smudged this way makes a very potent fertilizer. If there is no habit of smudge fertilization, local leaders should help the masses learn smudge fertilization. At the same time, the ash from burning firewood for frost prevention is itself a good fertilizer (but the quantity is small and not as potent as smudged soil). (Ministry of Agriculture)

　　防霜如何和薰肥结合？
    问：在八十三期人民日报第一版“防霜办法”中提到“缺柴的地方可与晚秋薰肥结合”，请问晚秋薰肥怎样薰法？如何保存？效力怎样？希予以解答以便传播。（赵县县政府实业科　关云青）
    答：防霜如何和薰肥结合，须看各地条件。如果群众有薰肥的习惯，那就利用薰肥冒起的烟来防霜。但防霜是烟越大越好，可是薰肥时柴草点火以后马上用土盖上，一面让火燃着不灭，一面又不可让烟跑的过多，烟雾向外跑的太大，薰的土就不壮，因此在薰肥时，如果要和防霜结合，就需要先了解风向，如果风由东往西吹，就可把薰肥按置在地的东边；反之，则按置在地的西边，这样就可把薰肥的烟顺风吹在田间。如果烟小，可多薰几堆。至于薰肥的办法，各地方法很多，其中比较简便的一种办法是在田地里挖一道“十字”壕，壕沟的长短看柴草的多少，堆的大小决定，壕深半尺到八寸就行，在两条壕沟的十字交叉的地方挖一锅底形的深坑，然后把柴草（或棒子等）铺在十字壕中间，用火点着，用土压在柴草的上面，但不要堵了十字壕四面通风的口，因为十字壕有两条交叉的十字沟，中间又有一个坑子，上面堆上土，下面仍可以让空气流通，因此柴草就能继续燃着，一直持续两三天不灭，薰的土做肥料很壮。如果没有薰肥习惯，一面当地领导上应帮助群众学习薰肥，同时防霜烧的柴灰本身就是很好的肥料（但数量少不如薰土壮）。（农业部）
