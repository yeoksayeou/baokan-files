　　Yangquan City Bank Office
    Distributes 20,000 Jin of Wheat Seeds
    [Our Newspaper] The Yangquan City Office of the former Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank, in order to meet the production needs of the masses, has decided to distribute 20,000 jin of wheat seeds to support the masses in planting more winter wheat. It has also assigned cadres to various villages to oversee the distribution. The city government and the bank office jointly issued instructions, pointing out two key points: (1) All districts and villages must carefully study and review the previous arrangements for wheat loans and carefully manage the distribution. (2) Focus on key distributions, preventing average dispersal. Geographically, prioritize disaster areas, old revolutionary base areas, and areas suitable for wheat planting; in terms of recipients, focus on households who have been allocated land and households that genuinely lack wheat seeds, ensuring that the seeds are used for planting wheat to avoid waste.

　　阳泉市银行办事处
    发放麦种两万斤
    【本报讯】原晋察冀边区银行阳泉市办事处，为适应群众生产要求，特确定发放麦种两万斤，扶植群众多种冬麦，并配备干部分别到各村掌握发放，市政府边银办事处，并发出联合指示，指出两点：（一）各区村必须慎重研究，联系检查过去布置麦贷，认真掌握发放。（二）抓紧重点发放，防止平均分散，地区上着重灾区老区适合种麦区；对象着重分地户和真正缺乏麦种的户，保证用于种麦，以免浪费。
