How Hujia Yao Organized Women to Participate in the Autumn Harvest?

The women of Hujia Yao Village, Licheng, have historically been active and had a foundation in participating in agricultural production labor; however, this year, due to class turmoil throughout the countryside and low morale among the masses regarding production, coupled with some deviations in mobilizing and organizing women in previous years, the enthusiasm of women to participate in agricultural production has been significantly affected, and the number of participants has decreased compared to previous years. At the beginning of September, the village work team, in order to fully mobilize women to participate in the autumn harvest and overcome the current labor shortage, conducted in-depth visits and small-scale discussions, using a heart-to-heart conversational approach to understand some of the problems hindering the mobilization of women to participate in agricultural production:

First, there was a utilitarian and one-sided viewpoint in mobilizing women for production. In the past, leaders did not pay attention to mobilizing and organizing women during normal times, but only temporarily organized crash programs during the busy summer and autumn seasons; when agricultural work was slower, women's work was put aside. As a result, over the years, there were few backbones among women in agricultural production, and their ideological awareness was insufficient. Another issue was the one-sided emphasis on textile achievements; women who couldn't engage in more textile work due to having children were criticized as backward elements. Consequently, "unencumbered" women (meaning those without children) were often held up as models and praised, which unconsciously dampened the enthusiasm of women who were burdened with children and busy with household chores. For example, when Li Qiulian saw other women being praised for textiles, she went home and scolded her children: "I shouldn't have had you; you make me less than human."

Secondly, there was inequality in mutual aid, and unreasonable work point allocation, leading to women with strong labor power being unwilling to cooperate with women with weaker labor power, and those without children being unwilling to cooperate with those with children. The reason was that work points were not recorded specifically according to the work done, affecting the enthusiasm of women who actively participated in mutual aid. For example, Gui Naiying was very active in mutual aid, helping this family and that family during this summer's wheat harvest, but as a result, she didn't get any work points, and her morale was low.

In order to solve the above problems hindering the mobilization of women to participate in agricultural production, on September 7th, a special meeting was convened with heroes like Shi Cunjin and the expanded production committee to study the issue. On the morning of the 8th, a general meeting of women was held for discussion. The leadership first made a profound self-criticism, criticizing the past erroneous thinking of completely obliterating women's other achievements when summarizing textile achievements, and the subjectivism of not considering women's other household lives when helping them set plans; at the same time, it also pointed out the bad behavior of individuals who "act like pampered mistresses giving alms," not working properly while holding a child every day. Then, a summary of the great achievements of women's participation in production throughout history was made, pointing out the significant role of women's participation in the fields during the harvest and cultivation seasons over the years. In particular, a specific summary of the comprehensive production achievements of all the women in the village from the summer harvest to the present day (eighty days) was made. After mass evaluation, more than a dozen women were praised as models of household production and textile models, which boosted everyone's morale. Finally, under the principles of democratic voluntarism and equal-value mutual aid, discussions and rectification were carried out in groups, and fourteen groups voluntarily combined. Group members and group leaders made self-criticisms and offered opinions to each other, and then, in response to past shortcomings, specific methods for equalizing work points and exchanging labor were formulated. The organizational form should be unified with men's mutual aid to facilitate unified planning of life, so that family life arrangements and group plans are unified; however, women should have a separate group leader to manage the adjustment of labor. Each work point is worth five catties of rice (regardless of meals), one day's work is worth ten points, and cutting grain is worth nine points per day. Work points should be issued in smaller denominations, so that even one or two points can be issued, and unified relations should be established with the group to overcome the past thinking that it was embarrassing to establish relations on an individual basis, so that hard-working families would not suffer losses. Appropriate commendations should be given for achievements, and comprehensive summaries should be made. On the afternoon of the 8th, teams and groups were again divided to formulate a specific half-month plan before the autumn harvest to prepare for the autumn harvest, focusing on making shoes, repairing cotton clothes, and pushing the millstone. When the autumn harvest begins, they will be able to fully enter the autumn harvest campaign.

　　霍家窑是怎样组织妇女参加秋收的？
    黎城霍家窑村的妇女，历年来在参加农业生产劳动上，是较活跃并有基础的；但今年由于随着整个农村阶级动荡，群众生产情绪不高，再加上历年来在发动组织妇女中的若干偏差，影响妇女参加农业生产的情绪不小，参加数量也较往年减少。九月初，该村工作组，为充分发动妇女参加秋收，克服当前劳力不足，便深入访问，小型座谈，用圪扯谈心的方法，了解了障碍着发动妇女参加农业生产的一些问题：
    首先是在发动妇女生产中的利用观点与片面性。已往领导上对妇女平时不注意发动与组织，只是到夏秋农忙时，临时组织突击一下；农事较缓，便把妇女工作放在一边。因而几年来，妇女在农业生产中的骨干不多，思想上的自觉性也不够。另外是片面强调纺织成绩，对常年劳动因有小孩连累，不能更多从事纺织的妇女，却批评她们是落后分子。结果形成“干身刷利”（没有小孩连累的意思）的妇女，常当模范，常受表扬，无形中打击了有小孩连累、负荷家庭繁忙的杂活的妇女情绪。如李秋莲在看到别的妇女因纺织受到表扬时，回家即骂她的小孩：“我生生跟上你们不当人啦。”
    其次是互助中的不等价，记工不合理，形成劳动力强的妇女不愿和劳动力弱的妇女互助，没有小孩的不愿和有小孩的互助。原因即是因为不能具体按活记工，影响了积极参加互助的妇女情绪。如桂乃英互助很积极，今夏收麦时，帮助这家，帮助那家，结果那家也没得上工票，情绪很低。
    为解决以上障碍着发动妇女参加农业生产的问题，九月七日，特召集了石寸金英雄等与扩大生产委员会，作专门研究，八日上午又召开全体妇女大会进行讨论。领导上首先深刻的作了自我检讨，批判了过去在总结纺织成绩时，把妇女的其他成绩完全抹煞的错误思想，及帮助妇女订计划时，不照顾妇女家庭的其他生活的主观主义；同时也指出，个别人“指上娘娘化布施”，每天抱上个小孩不好好劳动的坏表现。接着从历史上把妇女参加生产的伟大成绩作了总结，指出历年来在收耕中，妇女参加上地的重大作用。特别是把全村妇女自夏收后到现在八十天的全面生产成绩具体总结出来，经过群众评选，表扬了家庭生产模范与纺织模范等十几个妇女后，提高了大家的情绪。最后在民主自愿的等价互助原则下，分组展开讨论与整顿，十四个小组自愿结合。组员与组长互相作了检讨提了意见，随即针对过去缺点，订出今后折工变工等价的具体办法。组织形式要和男人互助统一起来，便于统一计划生活，使家庭生活安排与小组计划统一起来；但妇女要另外设一小组长，掌握调剂劳力，每工五斤米（不管饭），一工作十分，切谷每工作九分，工票要零星些，一二分工也能开，统一按组发生关系，克服过去按人发生关系不好意思的思想，使好劳力家吃亏。有成绩要作适当表扬，全面总结。八日下午又分队分组具体订出秋前半月计划，把秋前准备工作做好，中心是做鞋修理棉衣，推碾磨。秋收开始，即能全力进入秋收运动中。
