　　Unable to Endure Chiang Kai-shek Bandit "Currency Reform" Exploitation
　　Merchants and People in the Northern Henan Chiang Area Fled to Our Area One After Another
　　[Taihang Telegram] After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit currency reform, the Gold Yuan notes flowed into Xinxiang, Wuzhi, Xincheng, Mulandiandian and other places in northern Henan, and prices soared even more. To this end, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits re-imposed price limits, and many merchants refused to trade. Prices rose secretly rather than openly. The Xinxiang Chiang Kai-shek Twelfth Security District issued a second announcement on September 11th, revising the price limits (the first price limit was August 18th), using the market price on September 9th as the standard, stipulating that rice was 6 million yuan per dou, wheat was 4.3 million yuan per dou, sea salt was 450,000 yuan per jin, and cotton was 2.49 million yuan per jin. In reality, the black market prices in the city on September 15th were 9 million yuan per dou for millet, 8 million yuan per dou for wheat, 3.5 million yuan per jin for cotton, and 700,000 yuan per jin for sea salt. The second price limit increased the price of millet by 26.6 percent per liter, but it was still one-third lower than the actual market price. The prices of the above four items on September 15th were more than half higher than the first price limit. Although the Gold Yuan notes arrived in Xinxiang, they could not stem the rapid rise in prices. Mulandiandian forced the implementation of price limits, with secret agents, military police scattered throughout the market, forcing transactions at the limited prices. Anyone who did not sell goods at the official price was immediately detained. In order to plunder gold and silver, and to prevent merchants from converting their inventories into gold and silver, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits announced that all gold and silver had passed the exchange period and would be confiscated. The people of the city, unwilling to endure the exploitation and plunder of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, fled to our liberated areas with their children, goods, gold, and silver to live and do business in order to survive.

　　不堪蒋匪“币改”压榨
    豫北蒋区商民纷纷逃来我区
    【太行电】蒋匪币改后，金元券流到豫北新乡、武陟、新城、木栾店等地，物价更加暴涨。为此，蒋匪复强行限价，商人多拒绝成交。物价明不涨暗涨。新乡蒋匪十二绥区又于九月十一日二次布告改定限价（第一次限价是八月十八日），以九月九日市价为准，规定米一市斗六百万元，麦子一斗四百三十万元，海盐一斤四十五万元，棉花一斤二百四十九万元。而实际该城九月十五日黑市货价是小米一斗九百万元，麦子一斗八百万元，棉花一斤三百五十万元，海盐一斤七十万元。二次限价，小米每升涨百分之二十六点六，然比较实际市价仍低三分之一。上述四种物品，九月十五日的价格较第一次限价高达一半以上。金元券虽然到达了新乡，但不能扼住急飞猛涨的物价。木栾店则强迫实行限价，市场密布特务军警，强制按限价成交。谁不按官价出售货物，即行扣押。蒋匪为掠夺金银，以防止商人将存货变换成金银，复宣布所有金银现已过兑换期，一律没收。该城民众不甘忍受蒋匪压榨掠夺，纷纷携带子女、货物、金银，逃来我解放区居住，做买卖，以求生存。
