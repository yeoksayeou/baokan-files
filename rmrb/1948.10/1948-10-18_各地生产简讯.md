　　Local Production Briefs
　　▲ Laiyang pears, famous in Jiaodong, have had a bumper harvest this year. In forty villages throughout the county, there are 4,710 mu of pear orchards, estimated to produce 2,826,000 jin of pears, a double increase compared to previous years. Laiyang pears are known for their sweet and delicious flavor and have always been considered a delicacy, selling well in major cities across the country and abroad in the past.
　　▲ Learning from the experience of the spring grass shortage, the military and civilians in various parts of the Jin-Sui Liberated Area are now widely mobilizing to cut and dry wild grass for livestock feed next spring. Farmers in counties such as Zuoyun and Pinglu are cutting and drying green grass in every household, planning to use it not only for feeding cattle next spring but also for bartering for cloth and grain. A certain unit directly under the Military Region Headquarters, with twelve people, cut 15,000 jin of grass in half a month, which can yield a net of 5,000 jin after drying.
　　▲ Jilin Province has an unprecedented flax harvest, with a total yield reaching 3 million jin. This year, under the government's policy of rewarding flax cultivation and high-price purchases (in counties such as Yanji, first-grade flax is exchanged for three jin of sorghum per jin, second-grade for two and a half jin, and third-grade for one jin), the emancipated peasants have cultivated the crop with great care. Therefore, the quality of flax is better than at any time in the past. The fiber extraction rate of flax in the past never exceeded 12% for first-grade fiber (i.e., 12 jin of first-grade fiber extracted from every 100 jin of flax), but this year it can reach 14% to 16% for first-grade fiber, 6% for coarse fiber, and 3% for short fiber. It is estimated that all the flax can yield 400,000 jin of first-grade fiber, providing ample raw materials for the province's flax textile factory, while also greatly benefiting the farmers. In the Daqiaoling District of Wangqing County, the flax fields yield an average of 3,150 jin per hectare. Calculated at the rate of one jin of flax exchanged for two jin of sorghum, each hectare can yield an average of 6,300 jin of grain, more than double that of other ordinary crops.

　　各地生产简讯
    ▲胶东著名莱阳梨今年丰收。全县四十个村，共有梨田四千七百一十亩，估计可产梨二百八十二万六千斤，比往年增产一倍。莱阳梨气味甘美，向为珍品，过去畅销全国各都市及国外。
    ▲晋绥解放区各地军民接受今春草荒经验，现普遍发动割晒野草作明春畜草。左云、平鲁等县农民家家户户割晒青草，计划除明春喂牛外，还可换取布匹和粮食。军区司令部直属队某部十二人半月内即割草一万五千斤，晒干后可净得五千斤。
    ▲吉林省亚麻空前丰收，全部收获量可达三百万斤。今年在政府奖励种麻、高价收买（延吉等县一等麻一斤换三斤高粱，二等二斤半，三等一斤）的政策下，翻身农民均精心培植，因此亚麻质量较过去任何时期为佳。亚麻出线率过去正线从未超过百分之十二（即每百斤亚麻出正线十二斤），今年则可达正线百分之十四至十六，粗线百分之六，短线百分之三。预计全部亚麻可出正线四十万斤，使该省亚麻纺织厂获得充足原料，同时农民亦获大利。汪清县大桥岭区亚麻地，平均每垧收三千一百五十斤，以一斤麻换二斤高粱计，每垧平均可得粮六千三百斤，比种其他普通作物可多得一倍以上。
