　　[Taiyue Telegraph] In January of this year, the Yicheng County Cooperative, in order to breed livestock, universally called on the masses to raise young male horses and feed donkeys. After specific leadership assistance, as of October, the county has successively established nine donkey and horse breeding stations. According to statistics from six of these stations for half a year, a total of 317 breedings have been performed. According to Ma Yaning, the manager of the cooperative, many difficulties were encountered during this work. First, in the old society, those who "played" donkeys and raised young male horses had no status. Most people considered it a most unlucky and disappointing thing, and no one wanted to do it if they had any other option. For example, Liu En'yuan, the chairman of the Guanfuping Farmers' Association, whose father "played" donkeys his whole life, and he had "played" them for half his life. Later, because his wife thought it was detrimental to social customs, he was determined to change careers. When we first talked to him this spring, he repeatedly refused. Later, after the leaders patiently explained that today's society has changed, that breeding is doing good for the masses, that he would not only not be looked down upon but would also be supported, that the government would reward him, and that he himself could also make money, he slowly changed his mind. After that, he also persuaded Li Quan of Shiqiu. Second, after understanding the idea, they were afraid of being requisitioned for service and substitute farming. The leaders also explained the government's preferential treatment measures for breeding young male horses and donkeys. In addition to being completely exempt from service, the young male horses, donkeys, and breeders would also receive two dan of black beans per year as a reward. This eliminated their concerns. Third, once these problems were solved, they found that it cost hundreds of thousands to buy a good donkey, which the masses could not afford. Therefore, we also helped them obtain low-interest loans from the bank, which they could repay after making money. This is how the breeding stations were slowly established. Their experience proves that the task of breeding livestock cannot be completed with only general calls without personally taking action to solve specific difficulties. In addition, some livestock-raising households in the Third District do not pay attention to breed selection and practice crossbreeding, resulting in calves and donkey foals that are small, weak, and not durable, which is a great loss to livestock breeding. The county cooperative plans to help them improve breeding during winter production and continue to expand on the basis of the existing ones throughout the county, improving breeding techniques.

　　翼城县联社
  　具体领导繁殖牲畜
    【太岳电】今年一月，翼城县联社为了繁殖牲畜，曾普遍号召群众养儿马，喂叫驴。经过具体领导帮助，到十月止，全县已先后建立起九个驴马配种所，其中六个所半年统计，共配种三百一十七个。据联社经理马亚宁谈，这个工作进行中曾遇到过不少困难。第一、在旧社会里，耍叫驴、养儿马的人是没有地位的。一般人认为那是一件最倒霉败兴的事，只要有一点办法，谁也不愿干。比如官府坪农会主席刘恩源，他父亲耍了一辈子叫驴，到他手又耍了半辈子。后因他老婆嫌他伤风败俗，就决心改行了。今春刚和他谈时，他再三不干；后来经过领导上耐心解释，说明今天社会变样了，配种是给群众办好事，不但不会看不起，反而会拥护你，政府还要奖励，你自己也能赚钱，这样才慢慢扭转他的认识。经过他又打通石丘李全的思想。第二、弄通思想以后，他们又怕支差代耕。领导上又讲解了政府对配种的儿马叫驴优待办法，儿马叫驴及配种人除全部免差外，一年还发给二石黑豆，以资奖励。这样消除了顾虑。第三、这些问题解决了，但一买个好叫驴得几十万，群众铺垫不起。于是又帮助他们从银行获得低利贷款，等赚下钱再还。这样才慢慢把配种所建立起来。从他们的经验证明，只有一般号召，不亲自动手解决具体困难，繁殖牲畜的任务是完不成的。另外三区有些养牲畜户不注意选种，实行杂配，结果生下来的牛犊、驴驹子多是体小力薄，又不耐用，对牲畜繁殖上是个很大损失。县联社准备在冬季生产中帮助他们改进配种，并在全县现有基础上继续扩大，提高配种技术。
