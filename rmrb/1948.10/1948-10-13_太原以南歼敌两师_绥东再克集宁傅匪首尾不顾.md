Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, 11th: The People's Liberation Army south of Taiyuan annihilated approximately 5,700 men from the Yan bandit's Provisional 44th Division, Provisional 45th Division, and other units on the 5th and 6th of this month. At dawn on the 5th of this month, a portion of the North China People's Liberation Army launched an attack on enemy forces in Xiaodian Town, Heiyao, Qiucun, Nanbeizhuanjing and other areas 30 miles south of Taiyuan. By the 6th, they had annihilated the entire Provisional 44th Division headquarters and its 1st and 2nd Regiments (minus one battalion), the entire Provisional 45th Division headquarters and its 2nd and 3rd Regiments, one regiment of the Training Division (i.e., the 72nd Division), and two battalions of the Provisional 49th Division. According to preliminary statistics, 4,580 enemy soldiers were captured alive, over 1,100 were killed or wounded, and captured enemies included senior officers such as Li Zifa, commander of the Provisional 44th Division, Liu Younue, acting deputy commander, Zhou Mi, division chief of staff, Liu Gongyan, director of the division's political department, and Zheng Jizhou, commander of the Provisional 45th Division. The captured materiel included 1,671 rifles and carbines, 177 light and heavy machine guns, 88 small cannons, 12 mortars, 5 heavy mortars, and 5 mountain guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Suimeng Front, 11th: A portion of the People's Liberation Army recaptured Jining City, an important town on the Ping-Sui Railway between Datong and Guisui, on the 8th of this month. Currently, over 500 miles of the Ping-Sui Railway, from Chaigoubao in the east to Baitaqian Station east of Guisui in the west, is under the control of the People's Liberation Army, with the exception of the isolated stronghold of Datong. Since the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive in eastern Sui on the 24th of last month, it has captured five cities, including Jining and Fengzhen, and annihilated over 5,000 enemy troops. The vanguard of the People's Liberation Army has directly approached the suburbs of Guisui, the old nest of the Fu bandits. The Fu bandits hastily transferred their main forces, such as the 35th Army and the Provisional 4th Army, from the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway to reinforce and relieve the siege of Guisui. As their troops were just entering Jining City, the Chahar-East People's Liberation Army launched an offensive on the periphery of Zhangjiakou, capturing Chongli, Shangyi, Guyuan and other cities, and cutting off the railway traffic between Zhangjiakou and Beiping. The Fu bandits, who were supporting Sui, were forced to turn back east in a hurry to relieve their threatened Zhangjiakou. In the short period of just ten days, the Fu bandits ran back and forth on the eastern and western sections of the Ping-Sui Railway, following the command of the People's Liberation Army. This is the so-called "maneuverability" of the Fu bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, 10th: Preliminary results of the encirclement and annihilation battle fought by the Chahar-East People's Liberation Army in the Jiajiawan area, 30 miles northeast of Xuanhua, on the 2nd of this month, are as follows: A total of 2,015 men from the 2nd and 3rd Regiments of the Fu bandit Provisional 31st Division (previously misreported as the Provisional 5th Army) were annihilated (excluding one battalion annihilated in Zhao Chuanpu), of whom 1,271 enemy soldiers were captured alive. Among the enemies killed were Zhang Yuming, deputy commander of the Provisional 31st Division, and the division chief of staff and commander of the 3rd Regiment. Captured materiel included 3 mortars, 8 sixty-millimeter guns, 83 light and heavy machine guns, 21 submachine guns, 613 rifles, and a portion of other military supplies.

　　太原以南歼敌两师
    绥东再克集宁傅匪首尾不顾
    【新华社太原前线十一日电】太原以南解放军于五六两日歼灭了阎匪暂四十四师、暂四十五师等部约五千七百人。本月五日拂晓，华北人民解放军一部分路向太原以南三十里的小店镇、黑窑及秋村、南北砖井等地的敌人发起攻击，至六日止歼灭敌暂四四师师部及一团、二团（缺一个营）全部，暂四五师师部及二团、三团全部，亲训师（即七十二师）一个团，暂四九师两个营。据初步统计，生俘敌四千五百八十名，毙伤敌一千一百余名，俘敌中包括暂四四师师长李子法、代理副师长刘有虐、师参谋长周秘、师政治部主任刘公炎及暂四五师师长郑继周等高级军官多名。缴获长短枪一千六百七十一支，轻重机枪一百七十七挺，小炮八十八门，迫击炮十二门，重迫击炮五门，山炮五门。
    【新华社绥蒙前线十一日电】解放军一部，本月八日再次收复平绥路上大同与归绥间的重镇集宁城。现平绥路东迄柴沟堡以西，西抵归绥以东的白塔车站五百余里铁路，其中除大同一个孤立据点外，已全为解放军掌握。自解放军于上月二十四日在绥东发动攻势后，连下集宁、丰镇等五城，歼敌五千余，解放军前锋直逼傅匪老巢归绥城郊，傅匪仓忙由平绥东段将其主力三十五军、暂四军等部队西调增援，图解归绥之围。当其部队刚刚进到集宁城时，察东解放军又在张家口外围发起攻势，攻占崇礼、尚义、沽源等城，并切断张家口与北平间的铁路交通。援绥傅匪被迫又急忙由西折回向东，解救其受威胁的张家口。在不过十天的短期间，傅匪就在平绥路东西两段遵照解放军的指挥跑了一个来回，这就是傅匪的所谓“机动”。
    【新华社冀察热辽十日电】本月二日察东解放军在宣化东北三十里贾家湾地区的围歼战，初步战果查明如下：计歼灭傅匪暂三十一师（前报误为暂五军）第二团第三团（欠赵川堡歼灭的一个营）全部，共二千零十五名，其中生俘敌一千二百七十一名。在击毙的敌人中包括暂三十一师副师长张玉明，和该师师参谋长兼第三团团长。缴获迫击炮三门，六零炮八门，轻重机枪八十三挺，冲锋枪二十一支，步枪六百一十三支，及其他军用品一部。
