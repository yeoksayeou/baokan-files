　　"Learn from the Troops Who Attacked Jinan!"
    The Entire East China Field Army Cheers the Great Victory of the Jinan Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 12th] The entire East China Field Army warmly celebrated the liberation of Jinan and the great victory of annihilating over 100,000 enemy troops. A certain unit's model assault company gathered to celebrate despite the drizzling autumn rain. When the news of the Jinan victory was announced, cheers and applause erupted continuously. Soldier Ling Zaixiu happily performed the Yangge dance. Liu Anbin, a soldier newly liberated during the Kaifeng campaign, excitedly shouted, "We will also fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" Many squads and platoons held discussions on the significance of the Jinan victory. Many newly liberated soldiers reviewed their initial doubts and truly believed in the strength of the People's Liberation Army, resolving to work hard. The political department of a certain column also issued a celebration propaganda outline, calling on the entire army to widely recognize and publicize this victory. Inspired by the victory, "Learn from the troops who attacked Jinan" became a common slogan and action. Each company in the third battalion of a certain regiment improved their combat plans, posting them on their rifle stocks, demanding to complete more tasks in future operations. A certain unit's demolition squad intensified their technical training, ensuring they could complete their tasks in every future action. Commanders Xu Shiyou and Political Commissar Tan Zhenlin of the Shandong Corps also sent congratulatory letters to the participating troops on the front lines. The Shandong Corps political department's newspaper, "East China Front," published a celebratory editorial titled "Complete Victory in the Jinan Campaign," calling for "celebrating victory while preventing and overcoming possible pride and complacency," and urging "all commanders and fighters to continue their efforts, further enhance their morale and combat effectiveness, and strive for another great victory."
