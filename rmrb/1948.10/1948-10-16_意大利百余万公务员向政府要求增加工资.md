　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Rome - One million two hundred thousand Italian civil servants have strongly demanded wage increases and the immediate distribution of bonuses from the government. Vittorio, the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, delivered a speech in parliament on the 6th, criticizing the government's unwillingness to meet the wage increase demands of the civil servants. Vittorio emphasized that if the government does not immediately satisfy the employees' request for bonuses, they will use all means available to the trade union to fight. One day before Vittorio made this request, the strike of the Rome municipal employees, which persisted on the 12th, ended victoriously. The municipal government agreed to pre-pay the employees 12,000 lire and negotiate a full wage increase with the trade union next month. Furthermore, under Gasperi's reactionary policies, the number of unemployed in Italy has increased to three million, meaning that three out of every ten workers are unemployed.

　　意大利百余万公务员向政府要求增加工资
    【新华社陕北十三日电】罗马讯：意大利公务员工一百二十万人向政府强烈要求增加工资及立即分发花红。总工会总书记维托里奥六日在议会中发表演说，抨击政府不愿满足公务员工们的增资要求。维托里奥强调声明，如政府不立即首先满足员工们分得花红的要求，则将用一切工会能用的方式以进行斗争。在维氏作此要求之前一日，罗马市政职工坚持十二日的罢工已胜利结束，市政府同意预付职工薪资一万二千里拉，并于下月内与工会方面谈判全盘增资问题。又讯，在加斯贝利反动政策下，意失业人数已增至三百万人，即每十个工人中已有三人失业。
