Pingshun Cooperatives After Rectification
More Than Half Become Active

[Taihang News] During the county and district cadre expansion meeting at the end of May, Pingshun's leadership arranged for the rectification of village cooperatives, pointing out the importance of handicrafts and sideline occupations, and stressing the necessity of valuing cooperatives. Specific arrangements were also made for adjusting cadre compensation, dealing with outstanding debts, and improving organizational structures. Each district convened meetings of cooperative leaders, some even twice, to discuss the problems existing within the cooperatives and how to address them. Generally, villages focused on recovering outstanding debts and adjusting cadres. The rectification was more effective in experimental democratic party rectification and deviation correction base villages. Statistics show that the county had a total of 188 village cooperatives (as of July last year), with 63,265 members and a total share capital of 10,050,000 yuan. Currently, 170 have begun to recover, with 40,278 members and a total share capital of 14,000,000 yuan. Eighteen village cooperatives have not yet recovered. Among the existing 170 village cooperatives, according to statistics from 91 village cooperatives in six districts after initial rectification, a total of 24 unqualified and bad cadres were removed and 76 cadres were adjusted. More than 18 million yuan in outstanding debts were recovered, accounting for 56.5% of the total 32.52 million yuan in outstanding debts. According to investigations in six districts, 99 village cooperatives have become more active than before, not only continuing to operate their businesses as usual but also some villages have initially established democratic systems and formulated winter production plans for organizing the masses.
