　　International Student Union Plans
    To Send Construction Team to Vietnam
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th] Diantong Agency, Paris, 25th: The International Student Union plans to send a "construction team" to Vietnam this year as part of the International Student Union's overall campaign to assist young people engaged in the anti-colonial war. The International Student Union's plan has been warmly welcomed by the Vietnamese government and youth, who have informed the International Student Union of their willingness to pay all expenses for the construction team. The International Student Union is now inviting doctors, chemists, agricultural experts, electricians, engineers, and other experts to participate. The first team of the construction team is expected to be sent out on International Students' Day (November 17th). In addition, the International Student Union has also launched a campaign to send ambulance teams and medicine to Indonesia, but the Dutch blockade of Indonesia has prevented the Red Cross's medicine from reaching Indonesia.
