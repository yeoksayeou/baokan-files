　　【Ji Lu Yu Electric Dispatch】 In Weinan District 1, many instances of losing one's position occurred in the work of compensating middle peasants and resettling landlords and rich peasants. Village cadres of Dongdacao Village broadcast to the farmers through loudspeakers: "The district's decree: Landlords have returned, land-receiving households and landlords can freely draw lots for land, whether you want to or not, and it's no use going to the district to complain." This resulted in a serious chaotic situation. After the landlord Liu Fangzhi returned to Wawa Village, the village cadres treated him as a guest; when a funeral occurred, the villagers and village cadres gave him gifts. Most of the landlords in the village lived better than ordinary peasants, and their ruling position was still not overthrown. Xiaodi Village adopted a supply system for landlords, with the farmers' association providing landlords with food and drink on a monthly basis. The landlords still did not participate in production. In Shiyuan Village, landlords collected grain from door to door among the masses. After resettlement and compensation, the land owned by many landlords and rich peasants exceeded that of ordinary peasants. In addition to taking land from peasants to give to landlords and rich peasants, the cadres of Guotun Village also stipulated that landlords and peasants should divide the autumn harvest by a ratio of 40/60. The masses did not accept the land taken for the autumn harvest, and insisted on harvesting the autumn crops. The village cadres then forced the masses to hand over two dou of coarse grain per mu. In addition, the work team of Lintou Village also forcibly recovered a large amount of land from the peasants and returned it to landlords and rich peasants. Based on the above situation, all comrades of the District Committee conducted self-criticism, and convened a district-wide cadre meeting to conduct a review, immediately deciding that each cadre should seize the time to go deep into each village to inspect and re-handle the situation. All self-flowing settlements are invalid; those with fundamental errors should admit them to the peasants, lead the village cadres in self-reflection, and earnestly examine their positions. After the meeting, the district commissioners personally went to the countryside and took charge of key points separately. (Editor's note: It is very necessary for the leaders of Weinan District 1 to seriously examine and resolve to correct this error, but it must be recognized that this is due to a vague position and a lack of understanding of our party's general policy and general line. It is necessary to re-study the policy line for ending land reform and correctly carry out the two-line struggle against "left" and right deviations. Otherwise, correcting "left" errors will lead to right-wing errors, and opposing right-wing errors will still lead to repeated "left" errors. There have been many lessons in the past, which should be seriously summarized and deeply accepted to improve cadres.)

　　卫南一区有些村庄
  　强制农民退地引起农村混乱
    【冀鲁豫电】卫南一区在补偿中农与安置地富的工作中，发生不少丧失立场的现象。东大操村村干部用广播筒向农民广播：“区的法令：地主回来了，分地户和地主可以自由抽地，不愿意也不行，上区里去说也白费”。结果形成严重混乱局面。瓦＠村地主刘芳芝回来后，村干请人家客；过丧事时，全村群众与村干给人家送礼。该村地主大部都超过一般农民生活，统治地位仍未打垮。小堤村对地主采取供给制，地主的吃喝由农会按月供给。地主仍不参加生产。柿园村地主是在群众中挨门收粮。安置补偿后，不少地主富农的土地超过一般农民。郭屯村干除从农民中抽地给了地富外，并规定地主与农民四六分秋。群众对抽秋苗地不接受，硬把秋收了，村干便强制群众每亩交出二斗粗粮。此外，林头村工作组也强从农民手中收回大量土地退还地富。根据以上情况，区委会全体同志都作了检查，并召开全区干部会进行检讨，立即决定每个干部抓紧时间，深入到各村检查，重新处理。凡自流安置的，一概无效；有原则错误的，应向农民承认，带领村干作反省，认真的检查立场。会后，区委专员都亲自下乡，分头掌握重点。（编者按：卫南一区领导上认真检讨与决心纠正这种错误，这是十分必要的，但必须认识这是由于立场模糊，不了解我党的总政策总路线的结果。必须重新学习结束土改中的政策路线，正确开展反“左”右倾的两条战线斗争。否则，纠“左”时犯了右的错误，反右时仍会重犯“左”的错误。这在过去已有许多教训，应该认真总结，深刻接受，提高干部。）
