　　Quickly Find a Way Out for Native Indigo
    In response to the call to grow native indigo, we rented land, bought seeds, and built indigo vats, which cost us quite a bit. We were very happy to see the appeal in the September 3rd newspaper, "Please find a way out for native indigo," because it spoke our minds exactly. However, up to now, we have not heard any news about how the government will solve this request. We have already extracted the indigo (it is good indigo), but we cannot sell it. Therefore, we are so anxious that we must appeal once more, asking the government to find a way to solve the problem of native indigo's sales as soon as possible. Otherwise, we will not be able to afford the land rent, pay the public grain, and even our family's difficulties cannot be solved. We have heard that foreign indigo is still being imported, and some state-owned dyeing factories are still purchasing foreign indigo. This violates policy and hinders the development of industry and commerce in the liberated areas. We urge the government to quickly formulate specific measures to develop native indigo, restrict foreign indigo, and supervise relevant personnel at all levels to resolutely implement them.
    This is our urgent request, and we suggest that the government find a way to solve it as soon as possible.

　　快给土靛找出路
    为了响应种土靛的号召，我们租地、买籽种、打靛池，总共花费不少。我们从九月三日的报纸看到“请政府给土靛想出路”的呼吁，非常高兴，因为那上面正说出我们的心里话。但到现在为止，政府对于这一请求究竟如何解决，一点消息也听不到。我们靛是早打下了，卖不出去（靛是好靛）。因此，急的我们不能不再作一次的呼吁，请政府及早设法解决土靛的出路问题。不然，我们打不起地租，交不起公粮，连家里的困难也无法解决。我们听说洋靛仍然继续入口，有些公营染房仍然购用洋靛，这是违犯政策，阻碍解放区工商业向前发展的行为，请政府快订出发展土靛、限制洋靛的具体办法，并督促各级有关人员坚决执行。
    这是我们迫切的请求，建议政府及早设法解决。
