　　Preparing Sufficient Funds for Large-Scale Production
    North China Bank Urges Collection of Old Loans
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to further develop agricultural lending, the North China Bank is calling on all regions to step up the collection of old loans. It states: In most areas of North China, land reform has been thoroughly completed. This winter, we should vigorously carry out winter production and prepare for next year's large-scale production campaign. The head office has decided not to allocate any additional agricultural loan funds this winter. In order to support the masses in winter production, we must make full use of the existing funds. Therefore, around the autumn harvest, collecting old loans has become one of the main tasks in all regions. Whether this work can be effective will be a prerequisite for whether agricultural lending can be carried out in the future.
    Recently, according to incomplete reports received by the head office from various regions, the amount of agricultural loans that are due or overdue and have not been recovered is quite large. In many regions, it accounts for about half of all agricultural loan funds. For example, statistics from 26 counties in the Southern Hebei area show that 1.5 billion yuan of old loans should be recovered. After more than two months of collection, only 624 million yuan had been recovered by August 24, accounting for just over 40% of the total loans. Statistics from the Taihang Third Branch at the end of July showed that overdue loans accounted for 51% of all agricultural loan funds. In Wuxiang County, there are still loans from 1942 that have not been recovered. Statistics from the Taihang Second Branch show that there are ten types of loans for which the whereabouts cannot be found or which were not processed through proper procedures. In some cases, the bank has the documents, but the borrower does not acknowledge them. In other cases, there is a village name but no household name, or there is a household name but no village name. In Wuxiang, Heshun, Pindding, and Yushe counties, villages with outstanding old loans account for eight-tenths of all villages. If old loans of such large amounts, long delays, and chaotic procedures are not cleared up decisively, vigorously, promptly, and quickly, this year's winter production will be greatly affected.
    There are several reasons why loans cannot be recovered in a timely manner: (1) Cadres have a strong sense of bestowing favors, providing relief, and fulfilling tasks, and are not actively collecting loans. They believe that it is not good for the bank to collect loans from the masses, and they are indifferent to the collection of payments. Some even tell the masses: "If you can repay, repay; if you can't, you don't have to." Some are tails behind the masses, asking the leaders to "be lenient and postpone collection." Some emphasize that "the masses are currently engaged in production and need funds, so they should not be urged to repay." Village cadres feel that collecting loans is an offensive matter and are afraid that the masses will raise objections during party rectification, so they are unwilling to take active responsibility. In some areas, because we broke up the old organizations when granting loans last winter and adopted the method of personally visiting and connecting with poor peasants and hired laborers, they are passive in collecting loans. Some simply ignore it, while others say: "I didn't participate in the loans last winter, go find the leaders of the poor peasant and hired laborer groups!" Some bank cadres have a task-oriented view. After making a loan, they don't conduct checks. Some cadres go to the countryside and encounter borrowers who are difficult to collect from, and instead of actively finding ways to collect, they often use methods such as exchanging contracts for rollover loans or extensions. From the account books, it appears that the amount of old loans has decreased, but in reality, it is the same. For example, in Anfeng Village, Xiyang County, among 63 loan households, 55 had rolled over their loans multiple times. This also encourages the masses to delay repayment. (2) Some masses are unwilling to repay loans. When they see cadres coming to collect, they deliberately cite various difficulties. Some masses in southern Hebei say: "The loan has been invested in the cooperative. If it is withdrawn, the cooperative will collapse, what should we do?" Some poor peasants and hired laborers who received loans last winter never intended to repay them, thinking that the loan was just a form of relief: "It's democracy! If we don't repay, the public will have no way to operate!" Some veterans and military dependents believe that the loan was a form of care for them, and they lack the mindset of repayment. According to our understanding, the reason why these masses are unwilling to repay is that they want to "take advantage of the division of property" (this idea is stronger among the masses in old liberated areas than in new liberated areas). They feel that: "Loan interest rates are low, and the price of goods is rising every day. Delaying repayment for a few days can earn more money"; "If we repay, we won't be able to get another loan." Therefore, they keep delaying. (3) Past loan policies were biased. For example, some areas often focused on disaster areas and solely emphasized poor households when granting loans (granting loans in disaster areas and focusing on poor households is correct and should not be considered a bias. The question is whether the loans are used to organize the masses to carry out production, or whether they are used for general relief. If they are used to support the masses in production and overcome disasters, then it is entirely necessary. Therefore, it is wrong to refer to them as a bias in general. - Editor). Last winter's loans emphasized even more that they must be given to poor peasants and hired laborers. Some masses, because they themselves lacked the conditions for production (such as the lonely and widowed), were fundamentally unwilling to produce, and many wasted the loans on eating and drinking. During the land reform in Northern Yue and Central Hebei, debts were declared invalid, including bank loans, so some masses were waiting for the debts to be cancelled. Responsible cadres in some areas did not fully understand the serious existence of these phenomena, so they did not put great effort into addressing them. This has greatly hindered the further development of agricultural lending work and even made it difficult to sustain due to the inability to circulate funds.
    Recently, banks at all levels have been carrying out the work of collecting old loans. Some areas have achieved certain results. We are now compiling the experiences of various regions for everyone's reference: Collecting old loans is a mass work. Relying solely on the bank to do it will have little effect. It must be done under the unified leadership and deployment of the party and government, and with the organization of various forces. In particular, it is necessary to educate district and village cadres on policies and change everyone's mindset of bestowing favors and providing relief. The principle of collecting old loans is: all loans that are due must be recovered. However, for individual special circumstances, such as loan funds that have already been invested in production enterprises, and immediate recovery may affect the producers, or due to natural disasters, illnesses, and other reasons, it is impossible to repay on time, extensions and rollover loans can be considered. When renewing contracts, the principal and interest should be converted into real objects for calculation. The rollover period should generally not exceed six months. Some places stipulate that: rollover periods of more than one month but less than three months should be approved by the county sub-branch (collection cadres can decide on rollover periods of one month), and rollover periods of more than three months but less than six months should be approved by the special district bank. This strict method of restricting rollover conditions can urge borrowers to repay quickly and can be used for reference. The specific methods for collecting old loans are as follows: (1) Explain the loan policy to make the masses understand that the loan is to support production and is different from disaster relief funds, and it must be repaid when it is due. Ordinary honest farmers are willing to repay as long as we explain the principles clearly. (2) Organize borrowers to engage in production and earn money to repay the loans. (3) For a few households who deliberately delay repayment, we can take measures such as having the district government work team write letters to urge repayment or adding interest for overdue payments. (4) For those who are truly unable to repay and need to roll over, the procedures for renewing contracts should be carried out after most of the loans have been collected. (5) The loan procedures in some areas are chaotic and should be cleaned up in this collection process. (6) Check the use of loans during the collection process and solicit opinions from the masses on loans. Attention should be paid to preventing two biases: one is forcing repayment, like a merchant calculating accounts, and the other is a relief-oriented view, being unwilling to actively collect repayments.

### 准备充分资金开展大生产　华北银行催收旧贷

　　准备充分资金开展大生产
    华北银行催收旧贷
    【本报讯】华北银行为进一步开展农贷工作，特号召各地加紧催收旧贷。略称：我华北大部地区土地改革已彻底完成，今冬即应以大力开展冬季生产并准备明年大生产运动。总行决定今冬农贷资金不再增拨。为了扶助群众冬季生产，必须充分地使用原有资金。因此秋收前后，催收旧贷款即成为各地的主要工作之一。这一工作的能否生效，将成为今后农贷工作能否开展的先决条件。
    最近，据总行收到各地不完全的报告，农贷到期过期未收回的数目相当庞大，有不少地区占全部农贷资金一半左右。如冀南区二十六个县统计，有应收回旧贷款十五亿，经过两个多月催收，截止八月二十四日只收回六亿二千四百万元，占贷款总数百分之四十强。太行三分行七月底统计，过期贷款占全部农贷资金的百分之五十一。武乡还有一九四二年贷款未收回的。太行二分行统计，贷款找不到头绪或不经正当手续的有十种，有的是银行有手续，贷户不承认，有的是有村名没户名，或有户名没村名。武乡、和顺、平定、榆社四县欠旧贷款村占全部村数的十分之八。象这样数目大、拖延久、手续乱的旧贷款，如果不下决心用大力及时迅速清理，今年冬季生产将受很大影响。
    贷款不能及时收回有下列几种原因：（一）干部思想中存在着浓厚的恩赐、救济观点和任务观点，不积极催收，他们认为银行向群众收贷款是不好的事，对收款漠不关心。甚至对群众说：“能还就还不能还可以不还”，有的当群众的尾巴，要求领导上“宽恩缓收”，有的强调“群众正在生产，需要用款，不应催收”。村干部则觉得收贷款是得罪人的事，怕整党时群众提意见，不愿积极负责。有些地区，由于我们去冬贷款时踢破了旧组织，采取了亲自访问、串连贫雇的办法，他们对收贷款是消极的，有的根本不管，有的说：“去冬贷款我没参加，找贫雇组长去罢！”银行干部思想中有些任务观点，贷下去不进行检查；有的干部下乡遇到难收的贷户，不积极想办法催收，往往是用换契约转贷或延期的办法。从帐表上看来，旧贷数目是减少了，实际上还是一样。如昔阳县安丰村，六三个贷款户，就有五五户是转贷数次的，这也助长了群众拖延不还的思想。（二）有些群众贷款不愿还，见干部去催收就故意讲各种困难，冀南有些群众说：“贷款入到合作社，抽回来合作社就要垮台，怎样办”？去冬贫雇贷款，有的根本不打算还，以为贷款就是救济了他们：“民主哩！不还公家就没法！”有的荣军、军属认为贷款是照顾了他们，更缺乏还款的思想准备。据我们了解，这些群众不愿还款的原因，是想“占分家便宜”（这种思想老区群众比新区浓厚）。他们觉得：“贷款利息低，东西天天涨，迟还几天能多赚些钱”；“交了就贷不上了”。因此就一直拖。（三）过去贷款政策有偏向。如有些地区的贷款重点往往放在灾区，单纯着重于贫苦户（在灾区贷款，并着重于贫苦户是正确的，不应视为偏向。问题在于贷款是否用以组织群众开展生产，还是做了一般的赈济。如果是用来扶植群众生产，渡过灾荒，则是完全必要的，因此笼统地指为偏向，是错误的。——编者）。去年冬贷更强调一定要贷给贫雇，有的群众因本身没生产条件（孤寡等），根本不愿生产，把贷款吃喝浪费的不少。北岳、冀中土改中宣布废债，连银行贷款也在内，因此有的群众等待废债。有的地区负责干部对这些现象的严重存在了解不够，也就没有用大力去进行。这就大大的阻碍了农贷工作的进一步开展，甚至因资金无法周转而难持续进行。
    最近各级行都在进行催收旧贷工作，有的地区已获得一定成绩，兹特综合各地经验，供大家参考：催收旧贷是一件群众性的工作，只靠银行单独搞，收效不大，必须在党政一元化领导与布置下，组织各种力量共同去做。特别要对区村干部进行政策教育，转变大家的恩赐救济观点。催收旧贷的原则是：凡贷款到期要一律收回。但对个别特殊情况，如贷款资金已投入生产事业，立即收回可能影响生产者，或因天灾疾病等原因，到期实在无法归还者，可以酌量延期换新契转贷，换约时要将本利折成实物计算，转贷时间一般不应超过六个月。有些地方规定：转贷期一个月以上三个月以内者，由县支行批准（转贷期一个月者，催收干部可以决定），三个月以上六个月以内者由专区银行批准。这种对转贷条件限制严格的办法，能督促贷户迅速归还。可供参考。催收旧贷的具体作法，有如下几种：（一）讲解贷款政策，使群众了解贷款是为了扶助生产，不同于赈款，到期必须归还。一般老实农民，只要我们说清道理，他们是愿意还的。（二）组织贷户进行生产，嫌下钱还贷款。（三）对少数故意拖延不还的户，可采取由区政府工作组写信催收或过期加利等办法。（四）真正无法归还，需要转贷者，应在贷款大部收齐后，再办理换契约手续。（五）某些地区贷款手续混乱的，要在这次催收中加以清理。（六）在催收中检查贷款用途，并征求群众对贷款意见。应注意防止两个偏向：一是硬逼，象商人计帐那样。二是救济观点，不愿积极催收。
