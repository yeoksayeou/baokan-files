　　Teaching Should Be Considered a Major Form of Labor
　　Question: I have a few questions about land reform that I haven’t been able to figure out. Please explain:
　　1. When calculating the exploitation amount of rich peasants, should it be calculated at 15% or 25%? For example, there is a household that was classified as rich peasant when land reform began (January this year). Now, in August, when reclassifying the components, should the calculation of the exploitation amount be based on 15% or 25%? Another example: a household was not classified as rich peasant at the beginning of land reform (classified as well-to-do middle peasant), but was classified as rich peasant during the recent reclassification. When investigating this household's exploitation amount, should the exploitation calculation be based on 15% or 25%? If calculated at 15%, they would qualify as rich peasants; if calculated at 25%, they would not. I hope for a clear answer.
　　2. How should the components of landlords who have declined be classified? According to the 1933 document, those who have lived as landlords continuously for three years before the establishment of the new government are considered landlords. Now, there is such a problem: if a household was a landlord before the establishment of the new government, but after the establishment of the new government, due to various reasons, their economic situation changed, and they have genuinely participated in labor for five years, with no exploitation of others, becoming a general middle peasant situation, and there is indeed no feudal foundation, some people say they should be classified as “landlord-turned-middle peasant,” while others say they should be classified as general middle peasant. How should they be classified? There is also a household with the same conditions, who were swept out the door as landlords at the beginning of land reform. How should this be corrected and their components reclassified?
　　3. Should a primary school teacher before the establishment of the new government be counted as a labor force in their family? Should their salary be included in the family's total income? According to the 1933 document, teaching is a major form of labor, so their family should be counted as a labor force. But some people say that teaching is not a major form of labor and should not be counted as a labor force at home. What is the correct approach? When a teacher's salary is taken home, some people also object to including it in the total income. Is it correct to include it or not? There is now a household: if the teacher is counted as a labor force at home and the salary is also included in the family's total income, they are a middle peasant; if the teacher is not counted, they are a rich peasant. What is the correct way to calculate?
　　4. If someone exploits others by hiring long-term laborers while also being exploited by owing external debts and paying interest, should the exploitation and being exploited portions be offset against each other? There is a household that regularly hired one long-term laborer for three or four years before the establishment of the new government. One person in the family participated in major labor, and another was a teacher whose salary was entirely given to the family. At the same time, this family borrowed external debts to engage in commerce during the slack winter season. Should the portion of exploitation by this household be offset against the portion of being exploited?
　　5. Should women and children participating in major labor be counted as labor force? How should they be counted? For example, some women and children often participate in agricultural work such as pulling water wheels, carrying water (referring to carrying water to irrigate fields), harvesting crops, and hoeing the fields. Should they be counted as labor force? How much should they be counted? How should it be calculated? (Learning Group of the Fourth Administrative Office of Beiyue)
　　Answer: 1. Regarding the calculation of the exploitation amount of rich peasants, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has already stipulated in the decision on the two documents of 1933: "Problems not mentioned in these two documents and problems concerning the boundary between rich peasants and middle peasants should be based on other documents published by the Central Committee and Comrade Ren Bishi's speech 'Several Issues in Land Reform' made on January 12, 1948." Comrade Ren Bishi's speech clearly stated: "On this issue, the Central Committee has recently decided to adopt a more lenient policy than in 1933, that is, if there is slight exploitation (such as hiring someone to look after cattle or sheep, hiring odd-job workers, monthly workers, or even one or two long-term laborers, or having a small amount of land leased out, or lending a small amount of debt), and this exploitation income does not exceed 25% (one-quarter) of their total income, they are still considered middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants." Therefore, when distinguishing them as rich peasants or middle peasants, it is necessary to base it on this principle. If they are rich peasants, they are rich peasants; if they are middle peasants, they are middle peasants. There is only one standard, and it cannot be calculated arbitrarily. The two households mentioned in the letter should naturally also be calculated at 25%.
　　2. Landlords who, after the establishment of the democratic government, have participated in labor and stopped exploitation for five full years should have their components and treatment changed according to their changed circumstances. If they are equivalent to the situation of middle peasants, they should be changed to middle peasants and treated as middle peasants, and should not be classified as "landlord-turned-middle peasant." If such households were swept out the door in land reform, their components should be changed immediately, and an amount of land and property equivalent to the average should be supplemented according to the specific situation.
　　3. According to the 1933 document on class demarcation, teaching is a major form of labor. Therefore, when classifying components, teachers should be counted as labor force in their families, and their salaries should also be included in their family's total income. The classification of components should be based on the provisions of the 1933 document on class demarcation. It cannot be changed arbitrarily because someone objects, nor should it be considered that if calculated this way they are rich peasants, and if calculated that way they are middle peasants. This can easily raise the components of some people and is also a manifestation of not being serious in implementing policies.
　　4. If a family simultaneously exploits others and is exploited by others, if their exploitation exceeds 25%, they are rich peasants; if it does not exceed 25%, they are middle peasants. In the classification of components, it is incorrect to mutually offset the exploitation portion and the being exploited portion.
　　5. Women and children participating in labor should be counted as labor force, but whether they are considered major labor? How to calculate it? It must be calculated according to the specific circumstances at the time and place, and the labor intensity of each person.

### 教书应该算主要劳动

　　教书应该算主要劳动
    问：在土改学习中有以下几个问题没弄清，讲解答一下
    一、计算富农的剥削量究应按百分之十五呢？还是百分之二十五呢？比如有一户，这次土改开始（今年一月间）给他订成富农，现在八月份改订成份时，其剥削量的计算应按百分之十五呢？还是百分之二十五呢？又如有一户在土改开始时期没有订成富农（订为富裕中农），但在最近重订成份时，订成了富农，象查这户的剥削量时，其剥削计算应以百分之十五呢？还是百分之二十五呢？如按百分之十五算他就够着富农，如按百分之二十五算即不够富农，希望明确答复。
    二、地主下降户应怎样订成份？按一九三三年的文件，在新政权建立前连续过地主生活满三年者，为地主。现有这样一个问题：如有一户在新政权建立前是地主，在新政权建立后，由于各种原因，其经济情况变化了，并已确实参加劳动满了五年，并无对人剥削，成为一般中农情况，也确无封建底子了，现在有人说应订为地降中，有的说应订为一般中农，究应怎样订呢？又有同样这个条件的一户，在土改开始时，被按地主成份扫地出门了，现在应怎样纠正及改订成份？
    三、新政权建立前的小学教员其本人是否应在家里计劳动力？其薪金是否算在家里总收入内？按一九三三年文件规定，教书是主要劳动，故其家里应算作劳动力，但有的人说教书不是主要劳动，不应在家计劳力，究竟怎样对呢？教书所挣之薪金拿在家里，有的人也不主张算在总收入里，究竟算入对呢？不算入对呢？现在有一户，如果教员在家里计劳力，薪金也算在家里总收入内，他是个中农，如不算他即是个富农，究竟怎样算对？
    四、自己剥削人雇长工同时又被人剥削，揭外债，付利息，其剥削与被剥削部分是否应抵顶？有一户在新政权建立前三四年内，经常雇长工一人，家里有一个参加主要劳动，另有一人作教员，所挣薪金全交家里，同时这家在冬闲时还借一部外债搞商业，按这户剥削的人部分是否应与被人剥削部分抵顶？
    五、妇女儿童参加主要劳动应否计劳动力？应怎样计？例如有些妇女儿童经常参加拉水车、挑水（指挑水浇地）收割庄稼锄地等农活，是否应计劳力？应计多少？怎样计法？（北岳第四专署学习小组）
    答：一、关于计算富农剥削量问题，中共中央委员会在关于一九三三年两个文件的决定中已有规定：“这两个文件中没有讲到的问题及关于富农和中农分界的问题，则应以中央发表的其他文件及任弼时同志在一九四八年一月十二日所作‘土地改革中的几个问题’的讲演中所说为准。”任弼时同志的讲演中说的很清楚：“在这个问题上，中央最近决定采取比一九三三年更宽大些的政策，即有轻微剥削（如雇人看牛或拦羊请零工、月工，甚至个把长工，或有少数土地出租，或放少量的债），而这种剥削收入不超过其总收入百分之二十五（四分之一）者，仍算为中农或富裕中农”，因之，区别其为富农或中农时，都须根据这一原则，该是富农就是富农，该是中农就是中农，标准只有一个，不能随便计算。来信中所举两户，自然也都应以百分之二十五计算。
    二、地主在民主政权建立后，参加劳动停止剥削满五年，即应根据其转变后的情况，改变其成份及待遇，如已相当于中农情况，即应改为中农并按中农待遇，不应订为“地降中”，这样的户若在土改中扫地出门了，应即改变其成份，并根据具体情况补足其相当于平均数的一份土地与财产。
    三、按照一九三三年划阶级文件规定，教书是主要劳动，因之订成份时，教员在家里应算劳力，其薪金也应计算在其家庭总收入之内，划成份应以一九三三年划阶级文件规定作根据，不能因有人反对而随便改动，也不应考虑到这样算了是富农，那样算了就是中农，这样很容易提高一部分人的成份，也是执行政策不严肃的表现。
    四、一个家庭若同时剥削人而又受人剥削，如其剥削超过百分之二十五者为富农，不超过者为中农，在划成份中，其剥削部分与被剥削部分相互抵顶是不对的。
    五、妇女儿童参加劳动，应计算为劳力，但是否算主要劳动？怎样计算？则须根据当时当地具体情况，及每个人的劳动强度等条件计算。
