Yuci City Work Cadres Inspect Urban Discipline
[Jinzhong Electric] Yuci city work cadres gathered in late September to review their thoughts and inspect discipline. Some cadres were sent to support the front and believed that since the campaign was coming to an end, they could return home. In particular, village cadres saw the civilian laborers complete their tasks and return, but they themselves remained in the city to work, so they were uneasy and unmotivated. Some cadres, because their work was not determined in a timely manner, felt that this was unhelpful to the work, others looked down on them, and they had no one to take care of them in their lives, so their morale was low. Some cadres with low cultural levels and poor working abilities felt that urban work was difficult. A few with impure thoughts only made personal plans and wandered around the streets. The leadership reviewed the source of these errors and believed that the county party committee had underestimated the development of the situation and was not prepared enough before entering the city. Once the city was opened, it grabbed, transferred, and used cadres in a chaotic and unorganized manner. It only knew how to use cadres and ignored political education and life care. Some comrades said, "Someone takes care of the work, but no one asks when we are sick." The leadership fully accepted this criticism, and each comrade conducted a deep self-criticism. Finally, everyone unanimously stated that they would work with peace of mind in the future, overcome incorrect thoughts, and establish a responsible working attitude towards the Party and the people. As long as it is a task assigned by the superior party organization, they will guarantee its completion. A strict inspection was also carried out on the implementation of discipline. Whether it is a needle or a thread, whether it belongs to the masses or the public, it is a violation of discipline to use it privately without the permission of the Material Management Committee. As a result of the inspection, the comrades who had taken one or two items all recognized their mistakes and handed over all the items, which were all handled by the Material Management Committee. Most comrades consciously abided by urban discipline. Zhang Fenglin, Li Zhendong, and others who did not take a needle or a thread were commended at the meeting. Finally, it was decided to continue to implement urban discipline and rely on the masses to conduct in-depth inspections.

　　榆次城市工作干部
    检查城市纪律
    【晋中电】榆次城市工作干部于九月下旬集会检讨思想、检查纪律。其中有的干部是支前来的，认为战役告一段落，即可返家。尤其是村干部见民工完成任务回去，自己却留在城市工作，故不安心，不积极。有的干部由于未及时确定工作，认为这样是帮助工作，别人瞧不起，生活上又无人照顾，情绪不高。有些文化水平低、工作能力较差的干部，感到城市工作难作。个别思想不纯的，专作个人打算，街上游来逛去。这些错误的来源，经领导上检讨，认为进城前县委对形势发展估计不足，准备不够。城一打开，就乱抓乱调乱使用干部，茫无头绪。只知使用干部，忽略政治教育与生活关照。有的同志说：“工作有人管，有病无人问。”领导完全接受这种批评，每个同志都进行了深刻检讨。最后一致表示今后要安心工作，克服不正确思想，树立对党对人民负责的工作态度。只要是上级党分配的工作任务，一定保证完成。对纪律执行问题，亦进行了严格检查。不论一针一线，群众的与公共的，未经物资保管委员会许可，而私自用了的，都是违犯纪律的行为。检查结果，拿过一两件东西的同志都认识了错误，交出全部东西，统由物资保管委员会处理。大部分同志作到自觉的遵守城市纪律。张凤麟、李震东等四人未拿一针一线，在会上受到表扬。最后决定继续贯彻城市纪律，依靠群众深入检查。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（汪洋）
