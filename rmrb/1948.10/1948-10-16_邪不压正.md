  　Two. "Let's wait and see!"
    Second Aunt couldn't stop thinking about Ruan Ying after returning to Shanghe and planned to visit Xiahe again when Ruan Ying got married on September 13th. Unexpectedly, the Eighth Route Army liberated Xiahe in early September. Later, she heard that rent reduction and debt liquidation were implemented, and the Liu family was also liquidated. Liu Xiyuan also died. She sent her husband to see it once and learned that Anfa had also been allocated a house from the Liu family. Ruan Ying did not get married on September 13th, but the engagement could not be canceled. After the new year, on the second day of the first lunar month, it was time to visit the wife's family. Second Aunt wanted to go to Xiahe to see for herself, so she rode a donkey and went to Xiahe with her husband.
    When they arrived at the back door of Liu Xiyuan's courtyard, Second Aunt got off the donkey. Her husband led her and the donkey to Anfa's newly allocated house. Gougou saw them in the yard and shouted, "Mom! Second Aunt is here!" Anfa and his wife, Jinsheng and his wife, all came out from the south room to greet them.
    Second Aunt smiled and said, "Anfa! Moving here, you won't have to worry about rain, right? - Jinsheng! You and your wife are here to wish your uncle a Happy New Year?..." Anfa's wife and Jinsheng and his wife responded and went into the south room, talking and laughing. Second Aunt's husband said, "Anfa! Where should I tie the animal?" Anfa took the reins and said, "There's nowhere to tie it! Just tie it to this pillar!" Second Aunt's husband said, "Didn't you get a place to keep the donkey?" Anfa said, "We don't even have a donkey hair, what would we need that for? Don't think so thoroughly! This is much better than my leaky house." As he spoke, he tied the donkey and took off the saddle and reins, then returned to the house.
    As soon as they entered, Gougou asked, "Second Uncle! Did you bring me peanuts?" Second Aunt said, "See how thoughtful my Gougou is? I brought them!" Her husband untied the saddle bag and took out peanuts for Gougou. Second Aunt also said, "The peanut harvest was bad last year, I'll bring the child more next year!" Anfa's wife said, "Is this not enough? Gougou! Take a couple of handfuls and go play outside!"
    Second Aunt said, "This house is really nice: is that ceiling cloth or paper?" Anfa's wife said, "Paper!" Second Aunt said, "Look how good that paper is? It's like cloth! We've never even seen it, let alone lived in it!" Anfa said, "We farmers don't live in these: you can't put nails in the ceiling, you can't tie ropes, and there's nowhere to hang the grain seeds, you can only put them on the windowsill!..." Second Aunt's husband said, "Then why don't you move back to your leaky house?" Everyone laughed.
    Second Aunt said, "I haven't been here for more than three months, what's Xiahe become like?" Everyone said, "Much better." Anfa said, "At least we don't have to put up with the Japanese anymore!" Jinsheng said, "Liu Xiyuan can't be so fierce anymore!" Second Aunt's husband continued, "Your uncle doesn't live in a leaky house anymore!" Second Aunt asked, "How did Liu Xiyuan die? Did everyone beat him to death?" Jinsheng said, "No one beat him, the district work team didn't allow it. He actually died of anger!" Anfa said, "That old guy was really something! If it weren't for Yuanhai and Xiaochang, I don't think anyone could have talked him down." Second Aunt asked, "Yuanhai has that kind of ability?" Jinsheng said, "You underestimated Yuanhai: he was the chairman of a meeting of one or two thousand people. No one could argue with that old guy Liu Xiyuan, five or six people spoke before him, but he talked them all into silence. Later, Yuanhai got angry and said, 'Are you talking about me?' Liu Xiyuan said, 'If I'm talking about you, I'm talking about you: I'm just speaking from my conscience! You've been my old partner for twenty years, I let you make money and I gave you the profits, I let you borrow grain and I let you have low prices, and the wages I paid you have always been generous! Open the books and let everyone see, see who's taking advantage of whom? What problem do I have with you?…' Yuanhai said, 'I don't understand conscience, and I don't recognize ledgers, I'm just a hired hand, and I can only speak the plain truth: in these twenty years I haven't stopped working, what do I do every day? What do you do every day? What do I eat? What do you eat? What have I gained? What have you gained? I produce the grain for you to eat, and you make me pay for it, calculating it all out every year! That's how I take advantage of you! Based on your conscience! I've been your old ox for twenty years, and now I'm supposed to owe a debt that my descendants can never repay? Bah! Put your conscience away! According to you, I should even compensate you…’ His words opened everyone's eyes. One person said, '...Anyway, I deliver the grain I produce to him every year,' another said, '...Anyway, my property eventually went to him...' The old guy got angry and said, 'Without the account books, you're just being unreasonable!' That one word 'unreasonable' ignited everyone's anger. Someone shouted to beat him, and everyone rushed to drag the old guy down. Xiaochang smeared a mouthful of shit on him, and the district work team went up to hug him to stop the beating, and everyone finally stopped. The meeting became stable again, and Xiaochang pointed at the old guy's nose and said: 'Liu Xiyuan! This matter must be explained! You forced everyone to sell their houses, sell their land, beg for food, starve to death, sell their children… Now we're settling accounts with you, and you still say everyone is being unreasonable. Who is being unreasonable?' That question left the old guy with nothing to say. Later, the Debt Liquidation Committee was organized and was preparing to settle accounts with him for a few days, but unexpectedly, he died on the third day after the struggle meeting! Some say he died of anger, others say he choked on dirt." Anfa said, "No matter how he died, he's dead anyway, he can't do any more harm!" Second Aunt asked, "He's dead, so how can the accounts be settled?" Anfa said, "Later, naturally, we could only settle accounts with Liu Zhong. But after he died, everyone's anger wasn't so great, and there were a lot of concessions. In this village and other villages, we calculated that he owed more than five thousand dan of rice and more than twenty thousand silver dollars. In addition to taking out some grain and livestock, he also took out more than three hectares of land and three houses. Now he still has forty or so mu of rented land, ten or so mu of self-cultivated land, and this courtyard house in the front." Second Aunt said, "So the outside world says he was cleaned out?" Anfa said, "Not at all, not at all, even if there were ten households like mine, it wouldn't be equal to him!"...
    Anfa's wife was cutting vegetables when she heard Xiaochang's child, Xiaogui, saying in the yard, "Gougou! Who told you to get peanut shells all over the yard? Sweep it up!" Gougou said, "I won't!" "Are you going to sweep it or not?" "No!" "Slap!" Xiaogui hit Gougou, and Gougou cried. Anfa's wife opened the curtain and said, "Xiaogui! Why are you hitting Gougou?" Xiaogui said, "Why did he get peanut shells all over the yard?" Anfa's wife said, "It doesn't matter, I'll sweep it up for you!" Xiaochang's wife muttered in the north room, "How many times have you swept it?" Anfa's wife heard it but pretended not to hear, and continued to say to Xiaogui, "Don't hit Gougou! Gougou is small, you're big!" Xiaochang's wife muttered again, "If he's small, he should go to heaven!" Anfa's wife couldn't help it and said, "My child was taken to heaven! Your twelve-year-old child is hitting my eight-year-old child, and you, the mother, are giving him courage, does my child have any life left?" "Did you hit him? Did you hurt him?" "You don't think he hit him hard enough, why don't you come out and hit him too?" "Who can raise a child?" "Doesn't my child have a mother?" "If he doesn't have a mother, he can't be spoiled like that! Can the yard be clean for even a moment? People are messy, and animals are pooping!" "Are you going to sweep it up when he poops? Do you know you got a donkey pen?" "Didn't you get one? Isn't your 'problem' small?" "How big is your 'problem'? Isn't it all because your husband is a cadre?" Anfa saw that the more they argued, the more words they exchanged, so he said to his wife, "Forget it, forget it! Can't you say less?" Anfa's wife stopped talking, and Xiaochang's wife was still muttering something in the north room. Second Aunt asked, "Who lives in the north room?" Anfa said, "It makes me angry to talk about it: in this courtyard, except for the house we were allocated, the rest all belongs to Xiaochang." Second Aunt said, "He should get that much?" Anfa said, "Just this? There's also more than twenty mu of land! His 'problem' is bigger, and he's the chairman of the farmers' association, shouldn't he get more? Can't you hear how rough his temper is? We live in this courtyard, a lone house, the front courtyard all belongs to Liu Zhong, and the back courtyard all belongs to Xiaochang - the millstone is theirs, the grinding stone is theirs, the threshing ground is theirs, and the kitchen shed and toilet are shared with them, so we can't move or do anything without involving them. In our leaky house, although these things were also thanks to the neighbors, they were old neighbors, so it was much more intimate than this!"
    Before long, the meal was ready, and while everyone was eating, they continued to talk about the struggle against the Liu family. Second Aunt kept asking who had raised what problems, and who had received the most.
    Old Guai came, carrying a hemp bag, and shouted as he entered, "Happy New Year, Happy New Year!" After greeting everyone, Anfa's wife gave him two yellow steamed buns, which he put into the hemp bag. Anfa's wife pointed to the front courtyard and said, "If you go to the front courtyard, I guarantee you can get two white steamed buns!" Old Guai said, "I just like to eat yellow steamed buns, I won't go to eat Liu's white steamed buns!" Second Aunt smiled and said, "Old Guai! Didn't you turn yourself around?" Old Guai also smiled and said, "I don't have any 'problems' with him!" As he spoke, he left.
    Anfa said, "If you ask me, the fruits of this victory weren't distributed well: if the higher-ups are calling for the poor to turn themselves around, why can't those without 'problems' turn themselves around? Even according to 'problems' it's not fair - those who can talk well get more. Like Xiaodan! He was a lackey for the Liu family for half his life, what 'problems' does he have? He fabricated a 'problem' and even got a mule and several dan of grain!" Second Aunt said, "What? Xiaodan also got a share? In Shanghe, even the lackeys were struggled against, how can you give those people things here?" Jinsheng said, "He's become an activist now!" Anfa said, "That person can't be cured! He keeps his head sharp and drills wherever there's an opening! As soon as the Eighth Route Army came, Liu Xiyuan and his sons ran to a barren mountain to hide. Xiaodan was in charge of sending them news of any developments. When the district work team came to mobilize the masses to find Liu Xiyuan, someone said, 'Just arrest Xiaodan and interrogate him and we'll know.' When Xiaodan heard this, he personally found the district work team and said that he also wanted to participate in the struggle, saying, 'As long as you let me participate, I guarantee I can lead people to arrest Liu's father and sons.' The district work team said to everyone: 'As long as he can do this, let him participate, right?' Everyone said: 'Let him participate, anyway, everyone knows what kind of person he is, he can't fool us.' The next day, he really led people to arrest Liu's father and sons. On the day of the struggle, he saw the Liu family's power collapse, and he also spoke at the meeting, talking about several things the Liu family did to bully people that others didn't know but he knew, and some people counted him as an activist. After the Debt Liquidation Committee was organized, he said that the foundation of the house that Liu Xiyuan's father built was swindled from his family. Everyone knew he was trying to get something out of it, so they recognized this debt. Later, seeing that Yuanhai and Xiaochang had become cadres, he went to their houses to show his goodwill; seeing that Liu Zhong still had a lot of property left, he secretly went to apologize to Liu Zhong's mother. There's no need to mention him: he has an ingenious mind, he can never fall!"
    Speaking of Liu Zhong and Xiaodan, Second Aunt naturally thought of Ruan Ying's matter again and asked Jinsheng about it. Jinsheng said, "This matter is really hard to say: the family is always getting angry about this matter. I think it's probably my father's fault. If Second Aunt doesn't have anything else to do right now, come to my house and sit for a while, and I'll have my mother talk to you about it in detail!" Second Aunt agreed, and said goodbye to Anfa and his wife with her husband and Jinsheng and his wife. Jinsheng said, "Tie the donkey there for feeding!" As he spoke, he untied the reins and led the donkey, and the four of them went to Jucai's house together.
    When Jucai's wife saw Second Aunt, she first complained about her own suffering: "...Her father is stubborn, and the girl doesn't listen, I'm getting angry from both sides, and I can't afford to offend either side!" Second Aunt couldn't make heads or tails of it and asked her to talk about it in detail, and she started from the time she sent the gifts. She said, "After sending the gifts, I said to Ruan Ying: 'Things are still the same, and the date is approaching, some of the clothes he sent are too narrow to wear, and some are not fashionable to wear, take advantage of these two days to pick out the ones you can wear and alter a few pieces to wear.' She refused to listen from the start, and after four or five days, she finally started crying and doing a little bit; I also helped her. Before one piece was taken apart, altered, and sewn, the war broke out. When the Japanese left, the Liu family also ran away, and September 13th passed, Ruan Ying suddenly had things to say and laugh about. I said to her father: 'Can we finally call off this marriage with the Liu family?' Her father said: 'Let's wait and see! We can't decide yet!' After a few more days, the district work team came to mobilize the masses to struggle against the Liu family and arrested Liu's father and sons. Xiaobao came to Jinsheng and Ruan Ying and said: 'Tomorrow at the meeting, we must raise the issue of forced marriage and see what the Liu family has to say?' Her father strongly restrained her from bringing it up. Her father said: 'We don't know how things will change! If you let him fall into the hands of others! We don't want to be the first to offend people.' But it turned out that Liu Xiyuan died and Liu Zhong didn't die; everyone else raised their big and small problems, but we didn't raise this problem, and it was left hanging. When the struggle was over and the liquidation of the Liu family was over, I asked her father, 'Does our marriage with Liu Zhong count or not?' Her father said again: 'Let's wait and see! We can't decide yet!' I said: 'What are we waiting for? If it weren't for Liu Zhong mourning for Liu Xiyuan, he would have chosen a date to marry again!' He said: 'Mourning lasts for three years! What are you in a hurry for?' Later, I heard Xiaobao say that he had asked the district work team, and the district work team said that as long as one of the man and woman was unwilling, they could raise a reason and request to break off the engagement from the district. I asked him if it was still possible after sending gifts, and he said he heard the district work team say that as long as the things were returned, it was fine. I repeated these words to her father, and her father scolded Xiaobao for not provoking things. When Ruan Ying heard that her father didn't agree, she got angry for a few more days, and her father was also a little moved. At this time, that damned Xiaodan ruined things again: he was the matchmaker, and he couldn't avoid handling the return of the gifts. Hearing that Anfa said Liu Zhong had given him a few taels of silver, he spoke up for Liu Zhong again. He knew I had altered the clothes, so he deliberately said: 'It's fine! As long as you can return the things he sent in their original condition! If one piece is missing or damaged, you have to buy it in its original condition!' When Anfa told her father this, her father complained about me again: saying both 'Knowing it's hard to break off, what's the point of opening your mouth' and 'People don't have eyes in the back of their heads, who knows whose world it will be in the future', I couldn't answer. On the fifth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, her father said to Xiaobao in person: 'What is your real business coming here? Don't come here to say nonsense again!' He also said to Ruan Ying: 'Little children laughing and joking, what kind of behavior is that?' Xiaobao left with a red face, and Ruan Ying started arguing with her father. Her father said: 'If you dare to laugh and joke with those young people again, I'll beat you to death!' Ruan Ying said: 'Beat me to death then! Anyway, I'm going to die once! Being beaten to death is better than marrying Liu Zhong!' From then on, the father became ill with anger, and the daughter cried for a few days in anger. I said good words to both sides, but I couldn't persuade either side. Until now, the father and daughter can't say three words without arguing. Second Sister, don't leave today, stay for a day or two, and help me persuade both sides!" Second Aunt saw that her sister was crying and very embarrassed, so she agreed.
    Second Aunt first tested Jucai's tone: "Brother-in-law! I heard you're not feeling well?" Jucai said, "It's nothing serious! I caught a cold in the winter!" "I heard my sister say that Ruan Ying doesn't listen to you, and you got a little angry? What are children saying, why do you care about it? Can that still be taken seriously?" "Old people worry too much! I'm just making you laugh!" "What's there to laugh about among family? I say the children are grown up, and we can't control two generations. It's her own business, you should let her do what she wants!" She also deliberately said: "Ruan Ying is really not satisfied with this marriage with the Liu family, and I heard that as long as you're willing, you can break it off..." "Sigh! Young people can only see what's right in front of their eyes! It's not easy to break it off in the first place, and secondly, breaking it off might not be a good thing! The Japanese only withdrew four months ago, and they haven't withdrawn twenty li, who can guarantee they won't come back? If you offend Liu Zhong now, will Liu Zhong spare you then? There's also Xiaodan, on one hand he's an activist, on the other hand he's Liu Zhong's man, can we afford to offend that kind of person? Those young people don't think about the consequences when things happen, and when they cause trouble, there's no way out! Also, your sister told you last year, Ruan Ying's heart is with Xiaobao, I can't agree with that - firstly, it's not proper, and secondly, if she follows Xiaobao, I guarantee she'll be poor for the rest of her life. Xiaobao, whether his family has anything or not is one thing, but he himself is not ambitious and doesn't know how to plan for himself. Last year he was an activist in the struggle against the Liu family, he connected people from the east and connected people from the west, and his shouts were louder than anyone else's, but when it came to settling accounts, he couldn't raise any big 'problems', he only said he was short a few wages, and he got five dou of grain. Xiaodan fabricated a problem and got a mule and several dan of grain, he at least lived in Liu's house for a few years, is he even worse than Xiaodan? Can you see how stupid he is? Just from this one thing, you know he's bound to be poor! If she marries Xiaobao, how can she compare to marrying Liu Zhong! Don't look at him being struggled against! He's still a small landlord in this village! Now that Liu Xiyuan is dead, and he doesn't have a bad reputation, he has three or four family members, dozens of mu of rented land, isn't that a peaceful life?" Second Aunt said, "But he's a bit old!" Jucai said, "It's a common thing in the world for a man to be fourteen or fifteen years older!" Second Aunt asked, "So you're saying, your idea is still to marry her to Liu Zhong?" Jucai said, "No! My idea is to wait and see! Liu Zhong has to mourn for three years, and in these three years we'll see how things change - if it's suitable to marry Liu Zhong, then she'll marry Liu Zhong, if it's not suitable to marry Liu Zhong, we'll talk about it later, anyway, she can't marry Xiaobao!" Jucai said these words, and Second Aunt felt that "Brother-in-law is still more knowledgeable! I should use these words to persuade Ruan Ying."
    Second Aunt persuaded Ruan Ying: "Ruan Ying! Auntie wants to ask you something: I heard that you argued with your father a few times last month, making your father unhappy?" Ruan Ying said, "Second Aunt! I'm not afraid of you laughing at me! I didn't deliberately make my father angry, but with me in the house, my father can't help but be angry. What can I do?" "What do you mean? Does your father dislike you?" "It's not that my father dislikes me! It's because of that dirty marriage! Now my father has already shouted it out, and I won't say whether it's ugly or not! Because I want to marry Xiaobao, and I don't want to marry Liu Zhong!" "This girl speaks frankly! Young people have to think about the consequences when things happen!" "When don't I think? When don't I think? I don't know how many thousands of times I've thought about it!" "Do you think you can afford to offend Liu Zhong?" "The thousands of people at the struggle meeting can afford to offend him, it's just that our family can't afford to offend him?" "Young people only look at what's right in front of their eyes! Your father says the Japanese haven't withdrawn twenty li, can you guarantee they won't come back? If you offend Liu Zhong, will Liu Zhong spare you then?" "My father is just like that, 'afraid of wolves in front and tigers in the back'! Didn't my grandfather come as a refugee? If the Japanese come again, can't we just run away again? If everyone thought like him, Liu Xiyuan wouldn't die even in ten years!" "Your father says Xiaobao is not ambitious and doesn't know how to plan for himself, he was an activist and didn't get turned around. From this, he probably won't be able to make a living in the future!" "Xiaodan is ambitious, he knows how to plan for himself, he doesn't have 'problems' and he can fabricate 'problems' to get mules. According to him, should I marry Xiaodan?" "Your father says that although the Liu family was struggled against, they're still a small landlord in Xiahe!" "Whether he's a landlord or not, I'm not missing a father!" "Your father says it's a common thing in the world for a man to be fourteen or fifteen years older!" "Being a concubine or a maid are all common things in the world, I heard the district work team say that finding a man yourself is even more common in the world! Don't tell me I don't have any happy things in the world, and I have to do all the unlucky things?" Finally, Second Aunt asked: "According to what you're saying, is your idea to break off the engagement with Liu Zhong and marry Xiaobao right away, regardless of whether your father is willing or not?" Ruan Ying said, "If I were to do what I really wanted, wouldn't it be great? But if I did that, I'd really make my father angry. Father is still father, and I don't want to make him angry again. My idea is to wait and see. Liu Xiyuan just died, and Liu Zhong's mother is old and stubborn, she will definitely make him mourn for three years. In those twenty-seven days from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of September last year, things could change, and three years is a long time, can't something else happen to the Liu family? I won't talk about him dying or running away, if he doesn't die or run away, I'll think of my own ways: anyway, I'd rather die than marry him, and if I don't die, I'll marry Xiaobao!" After Ruan Ying finished speaking, Second Aunt felt that these words were becoming more and more reasonable.
    The two people have their own reasons, and the two sets of reasons are against each other. There are also two points that are the same - both want to wait and see, and both are willing to wait three years. Second Aunt told Jucai's wife the results of the conversation, and both of them felt that there was no way to mediate. But Jucai's wife was relieved: she felt that her daughter was very sensible and knew how to care for her father. She felt that although the two sets of reasons were against each other, they might slowly reach an agreement in these three years, and she thought her daughter was right about who should agree with whom.

　　邪不压正
    赵树理
  　二　“看看再说！”
    二姨回到上河，一直丢不下软英的事，准备到九月十三软英出嫁的时候再到下河看看，不料就在九月初头，八路军就把下河解放了，后来听说实行减租清债，把刘家也清算了，刘锡元也死了，打发自己的丈夫去看了一次，知道安发也分了刘家一座房子，软英在九月十三没有出嫁，不过也没得退了婚。过了年，旧历正月初二，正是走娘家时候，二姨想亲自到下河看看，就骑上驴，跟自己的丈夫往下河来。
    他们走到刘锡元的后院门口，二姨下了驴，她丈夫牵着驴领着她往安发分下的新房子里走。狗狗在院里看见了，叫了声“妈！二姑来了！”安发两口、金生两口，都从南房里迎出来。
    二姨笑着说：“安发！搬到这里来，下雨可不发愁了吧？——金生！你两口子都来给你舅舅拜年来了？……”安发老婆和金生两口答应着，说说笑笑进了南房。二姨的丈夫说：“安发！把牲口拴哪里？”安发接住缰绳说：“没处拴！就拴这柱子上吧！”二姨的丈夫说：“你就没有分个圈驴的地方？”安发说：“咱连根驴毛也没有，要那有什么用？不用想那么周全吧！这比我那座透天窟窿房就强多了。”说着拴住了驴，拿下毛连和捎连，也都回到房里。
    一进门，狗狗就问：“二姑夫！给我拿着花生啦没有？”二姨说：“看我狗狗多么记事？拿着哩！”她丈夫解开毛连口，给狗狗取花生，二姨还说：“去年花生收成坏，明年多给孩子拿些！”安发老婆说：“这还少？狗狗！装上两把到外边玩吧！”
    二姨说：“这房子可真不错：那顶棚是布的呀纸的？”安发老婆说：“纸的！”二姨说：“看人家那纸多么好？跟布一样！咱不说住，连见都没见过！”安发说：“咱庄稼人不是住这个的：顶棚上也不能定钉子，也不能拴绳子，谷种也没处挂，只能放在窗台上！……”二姨的丈夫说：“那你还不搬回你那窟窿房子里去？”大家都哈哈哈笑起来。
    二姨说：“我这三个多月没有来，下河变成个什么样子了？”大家都说“好多了”。安发说：“总不受鬼子的气了！”金生说：“刘锡元也再不得利害了！”二姨的丈夫接着说：“你舅舅也不住窟窿房子了！”二姨问：“刘锡元是怎么死的？是不是大家把他打死了？”金生说：“打倒没人打他，区上高工作员不叫打，倒是气死了的！”安发说：“那老家伙真有两下子！要不是元孩跟小昌，我看谁也说不住他。”二姨问：“元孩还有那本事？”金生说：“你把元孩错看了：一两千人的大会，人家元孩是主席。刘锡元那老家伙，谁也说不过他，有五六个先发言的，都叫他说得没有话说。后来元孩急了，就说：‘说我的吧？’刘锡元说：‘说你的就说你的：我只凭良心说话！你是我二十年的老伙计，你使钱我让利，你借粮我让价，年年的工钱只有长支没有短欠！翻开帐叫大家看，看看是谁沾谁的光？我跟你有什么问题？………’元孩说：‘我也不懂良心，我也认不得帐本，我是个雇汉，只会说个老直理：这二十年我没有下过工，我每天做是甚？你每天做是甚？我吃是甚？你吃是甚？我落了些甚？你落了些甚？我给你打下粮食叫你吃，叫你吃上算我的帐，年年把我算光！这就是我沾你的光！凭你的良心！我给你当这二十年老牛，就该落一笔祖祖辈辈还不起的帐？呸！把你的良心收起！照你那样说我还得补你……’他这么一说，才给大家点开路，这个说‘………反正我年年打下粮食给我送’，那个说‘………反正我的产业后来归了你’………那老家伙发了急，说‘不凭帐本就是不说理！’一个‘不说理’把大家顶火了，不知道谁说了声打，大家一轰就把老家伙拖倒，小昌给他抹了一嘴屎，高工作员上去抱住他不让打，大家才算拉倒。会场又稳下来，小昌指着老家伙的鼻子说：‘刘锡元！这理非叫你说清不可！你逼着人家大家卖了房、卖了地、讨了饭、饿死了人、卖了孩子………如今跟你算算帐，你还说大家不说理。到底是谁不说理？’这一问，问得老家伙再没有说的。后来组织起清债委员会，正预备好好跟他算几天，没想到开了斗争会以后，第三天他就死了！有人说是气死的，有人说是喝土死的。”安发说：“不论是怎么死的吧，反正是死了，再不得利害了！”二姨问：“他死了，那帐还怎么算？”安发说：“后来自然只能跟刘忠算。不过他一死，大家的火性就没有那么大，算起来就有好多让步。本村外村，共算了他五千多石米，两万多块钱现洋。他除拿出些粮食牲口以外，又拿出三顷多地和三处房子。如今人家还有四十来亩出租地、十几亩自种地和这前院的一院房子。”二姨说：“那么外边说斗光了？”安发说：“没甚了没甚了，象我这么十个户也还抵不住人家！”………
    安发老婆正去切菜，听得小昌的孩子小贵在院里说：“狗狗！谁叫你把花生皮弄下一院？扫了！”狗狗说：“我不！”“你是扫不扫？”“不！”“拍！”小贵打了狗狗一下，狗狗哭了。安发老婆揭开帘子说：“小贵！你怎么打起狗狗来了？”小贵说：“他怎么把花生皮弄下一院？”安发老婆说：“不要紧，弄下一院我给你扫！”小昌老婆在北屋里嘟噜着说：“扫过几回？”安发老婆听见也只装没听见，仍然跟小贵说：“不要打狗狗！狗狗小啦你大了！”小昌老婆又嘟噜着说：“小啦就该上天啦！”安发老婆忍不住了，就接上了话：“我那孩子就叫上天啦！你十二岁孩子打我八岁的孩子，还有你这当妈的给他仗胆，我那孩子还有命啦？”“打着了？打伤了？”“嫌他打得不重你不会也出来打两下？”“谁可养过个孩子？”“我那孩子还有娘？”“没娘来还惯不成那样啦！看那院里能干净一晌不能？人糟踏，牲口屙！”“屙了叫你扫啦？可知道你分了个驴圈！”“你不分一个？还不是你的‘问题’小？”“你有多大‘问题’，还不是凭你男人是干部？”安发见她们越吵话越多，就向他老婆说：“算了算了！少说句不行？”安发老婆不说了，小昌老婆还在北房里不知嘟咕些什么。二姨问：“北房住是谁？”安发说：“说起来瞎生气啦：这一院，除了咱分这一座房子，其余都归了小昌。”二姨说：“他就该得着那么多？”安发说：“光这个？还有二十多亩地啦！人家的‘问题’又多，又是农会主任，该不是得的多啦？你听人家那气多粗？咱住到这个院里，一座孤房，前院都是刘忠的，后院都是小昌的——碾是人家的，磨是人家的，打谷场是人家的，饭厦和茅厕是跟人家伙着的，动脚动手离不了人家。在咱那窟窿房里，这些东西，虽然也是沾邻家的光，不过那是老邻居，就比这个入贴多了！”
    不大一会，饭好了，大家吃着饭，仍然谈着斗刘家的事。二姨仍是问谁都提些什么问题，谁都分的东西多。
    老拐来了，背着个麻包，进门就喊“拜年拜年！”他跟大家打过招呼，安发老婆给他拿了两个黄蒸，他丢到麻袋里。安发老婆指着前院说：“你到人家前院，管保能要两个白面蒸馍！”老拐说：“咱就好吃个黄蒸，偏不去吃他刘家那白面馍！”二姨笑着说：“老拐！你就没有翻翻身？”老拐也笑了笑说：“咱跟人家没‘问题’！”说着就走了。
    安发说：“你叫我说这回这果实分得就不好：上边既然叫穷人翻身啦，为什么没‘问题’的就不能翻？就按‘问题’说也不公道——能说会道的就算得多。象小旦！给刘家当了半辈子狗腿，他有什么‘问题’？胡捏造了个‘问题’竟能分一个骡子几石粮食！”二姨说：“怎么呀？小旦也分果实？在上河，连狗腿都斗了，你们这里怎么还给那些人分东西？”金生说：“人家这会又成了积极分子！”安发说：“那人就算治不了！人家把头捏得尖尖地，哪里有空就跟哪里钻！八路军一来刘锡元父子们就跑到一个山荒上躲起来，有什么风声小旦管给人家送信。高工作员来发动群众去找刘锡元，有人说‘只要捉住小旦一审就知道了’。这话传到人家小旦耳朵里，人家亲自找着高工作员说人家也要参加斗争，说‘只要叫我参加我管保领上人去把刘家父子捉回来’。高工作员跟大家说：‘只要他能这么做，就叫他参加了吧？’大家说：‘参加就参加吧，反正谁也知道他是什么人，上不了他的当。’第二天人家果然领着人去把刘家父子捉回来。在斗争那一天，人家看见刘家的势力倒下去，也在大会上发言，把别人不知道光人家知道的刘家欺人的事，讲了好几宗，就有人把人家也算成了积极分子。清债委员会组织起来以后，他说刘锡元他爹修房子的地基是讹他家的。大家也知道他是想沾点光，就认起这笔帐来了。后来看见元孩小昌他们当了干部，他就往他们家里去献好；看见刘忠的产业留得还不少，就又悄悄去给刘忠他娘赔情。不用提他了：那是个八面玲珑的脑袋，几时也跌不倒！”
    提起刘忠跟小旦，二姨自然又想起软英的事，问了问金生，金生说：“这事真难说：一家人为着这件事成天生闲气。我看恐怕就怨我爹。二姨这会要没有别的事，就到我家坐坐，叫我妈给你细细谈谈！”二姨答应了，就同她丈夫跟金生两口子辞别过安发两口走出来。金生说：“把驴也牵到我那里喂吧！”说着解下缰绳牵上，四个人一同往聚财家里来。
    聚财老婆一见二姨，就先诉了一顿自己的苦：“………她爹死扭劲，闺女也不听话，咱两头受气，哪头也惹不起！”二姨听不出个头尾来，要叫她细细谈，她才从送礼那次说起。她说：“送过礼以后，我跟软英说：‘事情仍是那样了，日子也近了，他送的那些衣裳有的窄小得穿不得，有的穿得也不时行，你趁这两天，挑那能穿的改几件叫穿。’人家起头就不理，说了四五天，才算哭着做着做一点；我也帮着人家做。一件一件拆开改好了还没有缝，就打开仗了。赶到日本人走了，刘家也跑了，九月十三也过了，软英忽然有说有笑了，我跟她爹说：‘咱跟刘家这门亲事可算能拉倒了吧？’她爹说：‘看看再说吧！这会还不能决定！’又迟了几天，区上高工作员来发动群众斗争刘家，把刘家父子都捉回来了，小宝来跟金生软英说：‘明天到大会上一定把强迫婚姻这问题提出来，看他刘家有什么说的？’她爹强按住不叫提。他爹说：‘事情还不知道怎么变化啦！你叫他犯到别人手！咱不要先出头得罪人。’后来偏是刘锡元死了刘忠没有死；人家别人的大小问题都提了，咱这问题没有提，不长不短放下了。赶到斗争也过了，清算刘家的事到底了，我问她爹说：‘咱跟刘忠这亲事到底算不算数了？’他爹又说：“看看再说吧！这会还不能决定！”我说：‘还看什么？要不是刘忠给刘锡元守孝的话，人家快又择日子娶了！’他说：‘一守孝就是三年！你急什么啦？’后来听小宝说他问过高工作员，高工作员说只要男女本人有一个不情愿，就能提出理由来，到区上请求退亲。我问他送过礼还能不能，他说他听高工作员说只要把东西退还了也行。我把这话跟她爹学了一遍，她爹骂人家小宝不该挑拨。软英听说她爹不答应，又呕了几天气，她爹心里也有点活动了。这时候偏还有个该死的小旦又坏了点事：他是媒人，退东西脱不过他的手。听安发说刘忠又给他拿了几两土，他就又向着刘忠那一头说话。他知道我把衣服改了，就故意说：‘行是行！只要能把人家送的东西原封原样送回来！少了一件，坏了一件，照原样给人家买！’安发把这话跟他爹一说，她爹又埋怨起我来：又是‘明知道弄不断，开这口有什么好处’，又是‘人没前后眼，你知以后是谁的天下’，说得我也答应不上来。去年腊月初五，她爹当面说人家小宝：‘你来我这里有什么正事？再不要来这里说淡话！’又说软英：‘小小孩子嘻嘻哈哈，象个什么规矩？’说得人家小宝红着脸走了，软英就跟他爹闹起来。她爹说：‘再敢跟那些年轻人嘻嘻哈哈我捶死你！’软英说：‘捶死就捶死吧！反正总要死一回啦！捶死也比嫁给刘忠强！’从那以后，爹也气病了，闺女也气得哭了几天，我两头说好话，哪头也劝不下，直到如今，父女们说不上三句话就要顶起来。二妹你今天不要走，住上一两天，两头都替我劝一劝！”二姨见她姐姐哭哭涕涕很作难，就答应下来。
    二姨先去探聚财的口气：“大姐夫！听说你身上不爽快？”聚财说：“也不要紧！冬天里，受了点凉！”“听大姐说，软英不听你的话，惹得你动了点气？孩子们说话，你理他做甚啦？那个还能当一回事？”“当老的瞎操心啦吧！瞎惹你们笑话啦！”“自己人笑话什么？我说孩子大了，咱一辈不管两辈事，她自己的事，你叫由他一点算了！”她又故意说：“软英对刘家这门亲事实在不满意，听说只要你愿意就能弄断了……”“唉！年轻人光看得见眼睫毛上那点事！一来就不容易弄断，二来弄断了还不知道是福是害！日本才退走四个月，还没有退够二十里，谁能保不再来？你这会惹了刘忠，到那时候刘忠还饶你？还有小旦，一面是积极分子，一面又是刘忠的人，那种人咱惹得起？他们年轻人，遇事不前后想，找出麻烦来就没戏唱了！还有，去年你大姐也跟你说过了，软英的心事在小宝身上，这我不能赞成——一则不成个规矩，再则跟上小宝，我断定她受一辈子穷。小宝那孩子，家里有甚没甚且不讲，自己没有出息，不知道为自己打算。去年人家斗刘家，他也是积极分子，东串连人，西串连人，喊口号一个顶几个，可是到算帐时候，自己可提不出大‘问题’，只说是短几个工钱，得了五斗谷子。人家小旦胡捏了个问题还弄了一头骡子几石粮食，他好歹还给刘家住过几年，难道连小旦都不如？你看他傻瓜不傻瓜？只从这件事上看，就知道他非受穷不可！要跟上小宝，哪如得还嫁给人家刘忠！你不要看人家挨了斗争！在本村说起来还仍然是个小财主！如今刘锡元也死了，骂名也没了，三四口人，有几十亩出租地，还不是清净日月？”二姨说：“不过岁数大一点！”聚财说：“男人大个十四五岁吧，也是世界有的事！”二姨问：“那样说起来，你的主意还是嫁给刘忠？”聚财说：“不！我的主意是看看再说！刘忠守服就得三年，在这三年中间看怎么变化——嫁刘忠合适就嫁刘忠，嫁刘忠不合适再说，反正不能嫁给小宝！”聚财说这番话，二姨觉着“还是大姐夫见识高！应该拿这些话去劝劝软英。”
    二姨劝软英：“软英！姨姨问你一件事：听说你年头腊月顶了你爹几句，惹得你爹不高兴？”软英说：“二姨！我也不怕你笑话！我不是故意惹我爹生气，可是家里有个我，我爹就不能不生气。我有什么办法？”“这话怎么讲？难道你爹多嫌个你？”“也不是我爹多嫌我！还是因为那件龌龊亲事！如今我爹已经嚷出来了，我也不说那丑不丑了！因为我要嫁小宝，不愿意嫁给刘忠！”“这闺女倒说得痛快！年轻人，遇事要前后想想！”“哪天不想？哪时不想？不知道想过几千遍了！”“你觉着惹得起刘忠吗？”“斗争会上那几千人都惹得起他，恰是咱家惹不起他？”“年轻人光看那眼睫毛上那点事！你爹说日本人退出不够二十里，你敢保不再来？你得罪了刘忠，刘忠那时候还饶你？”“我爹就是那样‘前怕狼后怕虎’！我爷爷不是逃荒来的？日本再来了不能再逃荒走？都要象他那么想，刘锡元再迟十年也死不了！”“你爹说小宝那孩子没出息，不会为自己打算，当了一回积极分子没得翻了身。从这件事上看，将来恐怕过不了日子！”“小旦有出息，会给自己打算，没‘问题’也会捏造‘问题’分骡子。照他那么说我就该嫁给小旦？”“你爹说刘家虽说挨了斗，在下河还是个小财主！”“他财主不财主，我又不是缺个爹！”“你爹说男人大个十四五岁，也是世界有的事！”“做小老婆当使女都是世界有的事，听高工作员说自己找男人越发是世界上有的事！难道世界上有的如意事没有我，倒霉事就都该我做一遍？”最后二姨问：“照你这样说来，你的主意是不论你爹愿意不愿意，你马上就要跟刘忠说断了嫁给小宝？”软英说：“要以我的本意，该不是数那痛快啦？可是我那么办，那真要把我爹气坏了。爹总是爹，我也不愿意叫他再生气。我的主意是看看再说。刘锡元才死了，刘忠他妈是老顽固，一定要叫他守三年孝。去年八月十五到九月十三，二十七天还能变了卦，三年工夫长着啦，刘家还能不再出点什么事？他死了跑了就不说了，不死不跑我再想我的办法：反正我死也不嫁给他，不死总要嫁给小宝！”软英说完了，二姨觉着这话越法句句是理。
    两个人各有各的道理，两套道理放到一处是对头。也有两点相同——都想看看再说，都愿意等三年。二姨就把这谈话的结果向聚财老婆谈了一下，两个人都觉着没法调解。不过聚财老婆却放了心：她觉着闺女很懂事，知道顾惜她爹。她觉着两套道理虽是对头，在这三年中间，也许慢慢能取得同意，到底谁该同意谁，她以为还是闺女说得对。（本节完。全文未完待续）
