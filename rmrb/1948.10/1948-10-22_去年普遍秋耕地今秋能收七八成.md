(Taiyue Telegram) Autumn plowing has begun in various parts of Taiyue. According to reports from various regions, crops this year are expected to yield 70% to 80% of a full harvest in many areas, which is inseparable from the widespread autumn plowing carried out last fall. For example, Xu Village in Tunliu County, due to autumn plowing (as well as rectifying deviations and relying on organization), is expected to achieve a 90% harvest, increasing the yield by two dou per mu compared to last year. In Beiliangbi, Yicheng County, land that was plowed for cotton yielded 90 jin per mu, while unplowed land only yielded 45 jin. Therefore, various localities attach great importance to autumn plowing. The Yuebei Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the counties of Tunliu, Jincheng, and Qinshui have all given timely instructions and organized the masses for autumn plowing, and have all paid attention to some of the deviations in last year's autumn plowing. For example, last year's organization of plowing involved forcing women to dig the land and pull plows, which damaged their health. The instructions from various counties emphasize the need to prevent coercion and to proceed from reality, making different requirements based on local conditions. For example, Anze and Qinyuan counties should utilize all available animal power to plow all autumn land once, while Tunliu and Changzi counties should double-plow two-thirds, and Qin County should double-plow one-third. On the other hand, we must also oppose the laissez-faire approach to autumn plowing. Although the masses all understand that "scratching the skin in autumn is better than an old ox plowing next year," there are still many difficulties and even some concerns in autumn plowing that must be resolved. This year, some places have suffered from cattle plague, and the number of livestock has decreased. For example, in the four districts of Qinshui County, 388 cattle died from the plague in September alone, and there were 681 sick cattle in Jiyuan County. Therefore, the livestock difficulties in some areas need to be well resolved. Secondly, autumn plowing for the families of military personnel and cadres is also a problem. In many places, substitute plowing is unfair, turning the preferential treatment of military families into a burden for a few people in the village. On the other hand, the past mutual aid teams have actually become substitute plowing teams. Once these mutual aid teams are disbanded, no one will do the substitute plowing anymore. Because the cadres do not lead and allow things to drift, the substitute plowing work is very poor, which is also a difficulty in autumn plowing that must be resolved. Third, frost has already been seen in various places, and the ground will freeze early this year. Time is tight, and many places have disbanded their mutual aid teams and have not yet reorganized them. It is indeed not easy to plow all the autumn land once. In addition, some wealthy middle peasants are still afraid of post-autumn requisitioning and compensation, and dare not plow. These difficulties and ideological concerns must be resolved in an organized and planned manner. Currently, Tunliu and other places have successively begun autumn plowing. They have two methods of organizing plowing: one is like the villages of the Yuancun type in Tunliu, which already know the benefits of plowing and are accurately calculating labor and animal power this year, organizing plowing while harvesting. They are also organizing women with full or half labor to go to the fields. One way is to divide labor with men, with women in charge of harvesting and men in charge of plowing. Another way is to exchange labor with those who have animal power. Some villages, such as Dingdu Village in Qinshui County, have left problems in last year's plowing or this year's spring plowing labor and animal power exchange. For example, the Tan Fengming team said that cattle-owning households did not cherish their livestock. After discussion, it was re-stipulated that the cattle-owning households would be in charge of the plow. If the cattle owner did not have time, they could find someone else to replace them, and sufficient feed and grass were stipulated. Appropriate consideration is given to households with livestock. This is beneficial to autumn plowing.

### 去年普遍秋耕地今秋能收七八成

　　去年普遍秋耕地今秋能收七八成
    【太岳电】太岳各地开始秋耕。据各地报导，很多地区今年庄稼能有七成或八成收，与去年秋季普遍进行了秋耕是分不开的。如屯留许村由于秋耕（另外也因纠偏与依靠组织起来）所以能作到九成收，每亩与去年比较增加二斗。翼城北梁壁耕过的花地每亩收九十斤，未耕的才收四十五斤，因此各地很重视秋耕。岳北专署及屯留、晋城、沁水等县，领导上均及时指示与组织群众秋耕，并且都注意到了去年秋耕中的一些偏向。如在去年组织耕地中强迫妇女刨地拉犁因此损害了健康等。各县指示中强调必须防止强迫命令，并从实际出发，分别要求。如安泽、沁源能尽所有畜力作到全部秋地普耕一遍，屯留、长子作到双犁三分之二，沁县双犁三分之一。另一方面又反对秋耕的放任自流，虽然群众都懂得“秋天刮破皮赛过明年老牛犁”，但是秋耕中还有许多困难，甚至还有些顾虑必须解决。今年有些地方遭受了牛瘟，牲口减少。如沁水四个区九月份就瘟死牛三百八十八头，济源全县就有病牛六百八十一头，因此部分地区的畜力困难是需要很好解决的。其次军干属的秋耕也是问题，不少地方代耕不公，把全村优军代耕成为少数人的负担。另一方面是过去的互助组实际成了代耕队，这些互助一散，就没人再代耕了。因干部不领导，放任自流，所以代耕工作很差，这也是秋耕中的一个困难，必须设法解决。三、各地已见霜，今年上冻要早，时间紧迫，很多地方互助组散了还没组织起来，要作到全部秋地耕一遍，确是很不容易的事情。加上一部分富裕中农还怕秋后抽补，不敢耕。这些困难与思想顾虑问题，必须有组织有计划来解决。现屯留等地已先后开始秋耕。他们组织耕地的办法有两种：一种是如屯留原村一类村子，已知道耕地的好处，今年即精确计算劳畜力，组织边收边耕，另外组织妇女全半劳力上地。一种是与男人分工，妇女管收男管犁，另一种是与有畜力的变工。再一部村子如沁水定都村，在去年耕地中或今年春耕劳畜力变工中留下问题，如谭凤鸣组有牛户说使牛户不爱惜牲口，经讨论后重新规定由养牛户掌犁，如牛主没时间可另找人代替，并规定了充足的料与草。对有牲口户适当照顾。如此以利秋耕。
