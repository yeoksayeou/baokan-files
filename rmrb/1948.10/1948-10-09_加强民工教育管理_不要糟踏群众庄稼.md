　　Strengthen Education and Management of Migrant Workers
    Do Not Spoil the Crops of the Masses

Comrade Editor:

    On the evening of the 14th of last month, dozens of carts from Ningjin, Zhao County, and Luancheng counties in the 11th District of Central Hebei, transporting military uniforms, passed through Peizhuang Village. It was already dark, so they scattered and stayed on the main street and the road east of the village. They set off westward early the next morning before breakfast. About an hour after they left, Wei Baoyu and other villagers from the village reported to our office: "The carters fed our corn and grain to the animals, what should we do?" The Industry Section sent personnel to cooperate with the villagers to inspect. Along the way, corn husks and fresh corn kernels could be seen. Wei Baoyu's report was indeed true.

    After investigation, a total of 145 white horse tooth corn cobs and 45 catties of small corn (including the cob cores) and 35 catties of grain (estimated by ear) were eaten. In addition to making necessary explanations to the masses, we informed the responsible district office of the village by telephone to send someone to discuss a solution with the person in charge of the carts. Unexpectedly, the carts violated discipline again when they arrived at Guantou Village (10 miles from Peizhuang), stealing dry grass and corn from the masses. The owner discovered this, and the district cadres had also arrived. They jointly resolved the matter with the comrades in charge of the carts, and some grain and grass were compensated to Guantou. The villagers of Peizhuang came to the district, but the carts could not wait long, and the villagers of Peizhuang said they didn't want it, so there was no compensation.

    The occurrence of such incidents is not an isolated matter due to the lack of feed for the animals, and it is certainly not limited to this place. It is very obvious. It is heard (no specific materials) that many villages along the roads and highways have suffered such damage. Therefore, please inform the Logistics Headquarters to instruct responsible transportation cadres at all levels to strengthen education and management of migrant workers to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Otherwise, the impact will be extremely bad, especially in the new district!

### 加强民工教育管理　不要糟踏群众庄稼

　　加强民工教育管理
    不要糟踏群众庄稼编者同志：
    上月十四日晚，有冀中十一分区宁晋、赵县、栾城等三县运输军装之大车数十辆，路经裴庄村，此时天已大黑，乃散住于村内大街及村东道上，次日早饭前即启程西行，走后一小时左右，有该村群众魏宝玉等到本署报告：“赶车的把俺们的棒子、谷喂了牲口，怎么办？”当由实业科派员协同群众前去检查，沿道可看到有玉茭皮、新玉茭粒，魏宝玉等之反映确是事实。
    经检查结果，共吃白马牙玉茭一百四十五个，小玉茭子四十五斤（连棒核）、谷三十五斤（穗估计数），除向群众作必要解释外，当以电话告知该村主管区区公所派人前去与该部大车负责人商讨解决，不意该部大车行抵管头村（距裴庄十里）又违犯纪律，偷窃群众干草、玉茭等，被本主发觉，适区干部亦已赶到，乃与大车负责同志共同解决，已赔管头粮、草一部而完结。裴庄群众来到区，大车又不便久待，裴庄群众也说不要了，所以也没赔。
    似此事件之发生，并非因牲口无料之偶然事项，也绝非只发生于此地，是很明显的。据闻（没具体材料）各沿汽路大路村庄，这样糟踏的不少。为此请转告后勤司令部指示各级负责运输干部，加强对民工教育管理，以防类似事件之再次发生。否则影响极坏，在新区则更堪注意！
