　　Counterfeit Gold Yuan Continues to Devalue
  　Three Drops in One Day in Hong Kong Market
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] According to Associated Press reports from the 13th to the 16th: The counterfeit Gold Yuan continues to plummet in the Hong Kong market. The official exchange rate between the counterfeit Gold Yuan and the Hong Kong dollar is one (counterfeit Gold Yuan) to one dollar and twenty-five cents (Hong Kong dollars). On the 12th, it had already fallen to one to seventy-six cents; on the 13th, it changed three times in one day, opening at seventy-two cents, falling to sixty-six cents in the afternoon, and continuing to fall to fifty-nine cents at closing; on the 14th, it fell to fifty-one cents; on the 15th, it plummeted to forty cents. The exchange rate between the counterfeit Gold Yuan and the US dollar was four to one. On the 12th, it had already fallen to seven to one; on the 13th, it fell to nine to one; on the 14th, it continued to fall to ten to one; on the 15th, it plummeted to thirteen yuan and fifty cents to one. If the counterfeit Gold Yuan is converted to legal tender (one to three million yuan) and compared with the black market prices of Hong Kong dollars and US dollars in Hong Kong and Guangdong on the day of the "currency reform," the extent of the drop in the value of the counterfeit Gold Yuan is even more obvious and astonishing. On August 22nd, one Hong Kong dollar could be exchanged for 2.2 million yuan in legal tender. One month and twenty-four days later, one Hong Kong dollar could be exchanged for 2.5 yuan in counterfeit Gold Yuan, which is 7.5 million yuan in legal tender. On August 22nd, one US dollar could be exchanged for 11 million yuan in legal tender. One month and twenty-four days later, one US dollar could be exchanged for 13.5 yuan in counterfeit Gold Yuan, which is equivalent to 40.5 million yuan in legal tender.

　　伪金圆券继续贬值
  　在香港市场中一天三跌
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】据美联社十三日至十六日报导：伪金圆券在香港市场中继续暴跌不已。伪金圆券与港币比价，官价为一（伪金圆券）比一元二角五分（港币），十二日已跌至一比七角六分；十三日一天三变，开盘七角二分，午后跌为六角六分，收盘时续跌至五角九分；十四日跌至五角一分；十五日暴跌至四角。又伪金圆券与美元比价为四比一，十二日已跌至七比一；十三日跌至九比一；十四日续跌至十比一；十五日猛跌至十三元五角比一。如果把伪金圆券折合法币（一比三百万元），并与“币改”实行日港币及美元在港粤的黑市价格相较，伪金圆券价值跌落的程度是更为明显也更为惊人。八月二十二日港币一元换法币二百二十万元，一个月零二十四天后，港币一元就换伪金圆券二元五角，即换法币七百五十万元，八月二十二日美元一元换法币一千一百万元，一个月零二十四天后，美元一元就换伪金圆券十三元五角，折合法币已达四千零五十万元。
