Semimonthly Price Overview
North China Trade General Administration Data Room
September 1st - 15th

Over the past half-month in the North China Liberated Areas, due to the approaching autumn harvest and increased supplies, coupled with the busy autumn harvest season and sluggish market transactions, various commodity prices have generally shown a downward trend. The price changes of major commodities are reported separately as follows:

Grain: In most areas, new red sorghum and corn have entered the market, but sales are slow, and prices have generally declined. Since the Mid-Autumn Festival, beans have seen a general price increase as the masses are planting wheat and applying fertilizer (soybean cake, etc.), and oil mills have started operating, absorbing more raw materials. Rice and wheat prices are generally stable, but wheat prices rose temporarily around the Mid-Autumn Festival due to the increased demand for white flour for the holiday, but have now returned to normal. In addition, price fluctuations vary depending on the specific circumstances in different regions. The price of grain in Ji-Lu-Yu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) near enemy areas (Xinxiang) has been volatile, affecting the grain prices in the border areas of that region. From the end of August to September 9th in Puyang, all grains except red sorghum rose by about 12%. In Handan City, Ji'nan, and the Linzhang area in the southeast of Hebei, there are fewer regular buyers of grain (especially red sorghum), and prices have fallen significantly. From late August to September 12th, rice and wheat fell by 15%, and red sorghum fell by 22.5%, except for black beans, which rose by 20%. In the west-central part of Hengshui (Xinji Shizhuang), the decline in grain prices in sales areas has led to sluggish sales and weak prices. From the 5th to the 15th, millet fell by 7%, wheat fell by 3.5%, and corn and red sorghum fell by 2.3%, while black beans rose by 2-3%. Prices in Linqing and Nangong remained stable. In Central Hebei: The average price of rice and wheat in Xinji, Bozhen, and Duancun fell by about 12% from the 2nd to the 16th, and red sorghum and corn fell by 15%. In Shizhuang City, millet fell by 18.5% from the 2nd to the 15th, wheat fell slightly by 3%, and miscellaneous grains fell by an average of about 13%. In the Beiyue District: Taking Laiyuan in the north, Pingshan in the center, and Yangquan in the south as standards, the average price of millet has fallen by more than 9% in the past half month, wheat has remained stable, and corn and red sorghum have fallen by about 15%. In the new Jinzhong District: Because of the devastation and exploitation by the Yan bandit troops, material resources are scarce, and grain prices were particularly high for a period after liberation. After various adjustments by our democratic government and the correct implementation of industrial and commercial policies, most of the industry and commerce in the cities have recovered recently, people's livelihood has stabilized, material resources from the old areas have been continuously transported there, the relationship between supply and demand in the market has gradually returned to normal, and prices have gradually declined. From September 1st to 14th, the average price of grain in Yuci fell by about 30%, and has now stabilized. In the eastern part of Taihang and Taiyue, grain prices have turned from high to weak in the past half month. Due to the drought and poor harvest last year, grain prices in these two areas have been relatively high since the beginning of spring. Until the middle of this month, new grains began to enter the market in various places, and prices gradually declined, but the number was not large. Centering on Changzhi and Jincheng, the average price of grains fell by 4-5% from the end of August to September 12th, but beans (yellow and black beans) are still relatively high. In general, grain prices in the inland are weak. The recent grain prices in major markets are listed below (calculated by market dou):

| Xinji     | 4800   | 5400   | 2700        | 2900   | 5400       |

Cotton: In the past half month, cotton prices have generally declined due to the following reasons: a large amount of new cotton has entered the market, and the stock of old cotton is also abundant, but sales are not widespread. Currently, it is the busy autumn harvest season, and textile production in the interior has temporarily stopped. In addition, regarding exports: Since the Chiang bandit's "currency reform," the blockade against the liberated areas has become even more severe, and they are attempting to seize cotton from our region by dumping American goods. Although the export of cotton is welcomed by the enemy, it cannot be exchanged for essential materials. Therefore, cotton is currently in a state of weak domestic sales and unprofitable exports.

Homespun Cloth: Before September 5th, homespun cloth was once active in the import and export areas. Afterwards, due to the impact of the decline in cotton and grain prices, coupled with sluggish foreign sales, cloth prices gradually declined. Currently, the activity is limited to areas with weak textile foundations and non-cotton producing areas. The price of cloth has slightly increased as the masses purchase autumn clothing. In addition, cloth prices in most other areas are weak. It is estimated that cloth prices will become active after the autumn harvest. The main types of homespun cloth, their prices, and their increases and decreases in the whole region are listed below:

Guangping Cloth: Handan, 560 yuan per double market foot, down 7% from late August, down 20% from mid-August; Changzhi, 370 yuan per market foot, up 7% from late August. Pingshan Cloth: 14,000 yuan per bolt (one square foot wide and 33-34 market feet long) locally, up 7.7% from mid-August. Jizhong Homespun Cloth (produced in Zhengding): Medium price of 15,000 yuan per bolt (1.1 market feet wide and 44 market feet long) in the Beiyue District market. Sanhuan Cloth (produced on the Zhuanlu in the Beiyue District): Local selling price of 9,755 yuan per bolt (same length and width as Pingshan Cloth, but of poorer quality). Xinxin Lupa brand foreign cloth 145,000 yuan per bolt (2.7 market feet wide, 110 market feet long), Shizhuang market price, down 12% from late August.

Salt: Recently, the rainy season has passed, roads have been repaired, transportation is convenient, and the source of salt is smooth. Except for remote areas with inconvenient transportation where prices are still high, prices in general areas are stable and falling. Bohai Salt: The market price in Dezhou on the 15th was 250 yuan (North Coin), Bozhen was 180 yuan, down 14% from late August, Handan was 325 yuan on the 12th, down 5% from late August, Shizhuang was 320 yuan, flat, Beiyue North was about 600 yuan, Central Pingshan was 400 yuan on the 15th, flat, Bohai Salt in Pingyao and Yuci in Jinzhong was 800 yuan, and Luzhou Salt was 750 yuan, a prominent price. Luzhou Salt: Yicheng was 230 yuan, flat, the northern part of the Beiyue District was 500 yuan, and sea salt in the hinterland of Taihang was 500 yuan, flat.

Vegetable Oil: In the past half month, edible oil prices have generally been weak. Prices once showed an increase around the Mid-Autumn Festival due to the large demand from the masses for the holiday, but after the festival, they declined again. Because the masses in various places have learned from the high increase in oil prices last year and found it profitable, the planting volume of oil crops (rapeseed, peanuts, etc.) this year is relatively common, and due to the smooth outflow of oil since the summer, the price has fallen. Recently, oil mills in various places have started to press oil to meet the needs of the masses for planting wheat and applying fertilizer (soybean cake), and a large amount of soybean oil will pour out, and prices are still expected to be weak. The rise and fall of oil prices from late August to the 15th of this month are listed below:

White Oil: The general price in Central Hebei is 1600-1750 yuan, down 10-12%. The average price in Southern Hebei, with Linqing and Nangong as the standard, is 1500 yuan, flat. Sesame Oil: The price in Guodao and Jincheng in Taiyue is 1900 yuan. The general edible oil (sesame oil, large mill sesame oil) in the new Jinzhong District is 2300-2400 yuan. The price of gourd oil in the Beiyue District, Hunyuan and Laiyuan, is about 1650 yuan, down 15%.

Foreign Goods: Due to the large number of imported foreign paper, prices have fallen due to fewer buyers. The price of oiled paper and glazed printing paper in major cities in Southern Hebei fell by 10% from late August to the 12th of this month. The price of large cardboard in Ji-Lu-Yu also fell by 8-9%. The price of matches has risen due to the limited number of imports and the large demand in the interior. The price of Nanjing matches in Shizhuang on the 15th was 1470 yuan per package. The price of Nanjing matches in Handan was short, 880 yuan per package, up 80 yuan, and the price of Sanguang matches was 197,000 yuan per cage, up 5%.

　　半月物价概况
    华北贸总资料室
    九月一日——十五日
    华北解放区半月来，由于秋收已届物资增加，再加秋收农忙，市场交易清淡，各种物价均呈疲落。现将各主要商品价格变化情况，分别报导于下：
    粮食　　红粮玉米大部地区新品已经上市，销路不畅，普遍呈显下降；豆类从中秋节以后，群众种麦施肥（豆饼等）并且油坊开工，吸收原料较多，价格普遍上升；米麦一般平稳，惟麦在中秋节前后，因过节需白面者较多，价曾一度上升现已趋平。另外又因各地具体情况不同，物价涨落尚有差异。冀鲁豫近因敌区（新乡方面）粮价波动，影响该区边沿地带粮价亦显不稳。濮阳八月终至九月九日，除红粮外，其他各粮均升１２％左右。冀南邯郸市，东南临漳一带来粮经常（尤以红粮为多）购者较少，价显下跌。从八月下旬至九月十二日，除黑豆上升２０％外，米麦下跌１５％，红粮跌２２．５％。衡水内西部（辛集石庄）销地粮价下落，致销路不畅，价亦疲落；五日至十五日小米降７％，小麦降３．５％，玉米红粮降２．３％，惟黑豆升２—３％。临清、南宫等地价持平稳。冀中：辛集、泊镇、端村等地二日至十六日米麦平均下跌１２％左右，红粮玉米下跌１５％。石庄市二百至十五日小米降１８．５％，小麦微落３％，杂粮平均下跌１３％左右。北岳区：北以涞源、中以平山、南以阳泉为标准，半月来小米平均下跌９％以上，小麦持平，玉米红粮下跌１５％左右。晋中新区：因为曾经阎匪的蹂躏压榨，造成物资贫困，解放后一个时期粮价特别高涨，后经我民主政府多方的调剂，并正确地执行了工商业政策，近来各城市工商业大部恢复，民生安定，老区物资源源运去，市面供求关系步入正常，物价渐趋下落。九月一日至十四日榆次各粮平均下跌３０％左右，现已稳定。太行与太岳东部半月来粮食由昂转疲。该二地由于去年旱荒，农产歉收，从入春以来粮价即较昂贵，迄至本月中旬，各地新粮开始上市，价格渐趋下降，但为数不大。以长治晋城为中心从八月终至九月十二日各粮平均下跌４—５％，惟豆类（黄黑豆）仍较高。总的来讲，内地粮价是疲落的。现将各主要市场最近粮价列下（以市斗计）：地　名　　　小米　　    小麦　　　 红粮　　　  玉米　　　  黑豆南　宫　四三四○　　四六四七　　三○○○　　三二五七　　四八一○伍仁桥　五二○○　　六二五○　　二六五○　　三○○○　　四八○○平　山　五○○○　　六二五○　　三六○○　　四二○○　　五○○○长　治　六○○○　　六四○○　　　——　　　三七○○　　五三○○翼　城　三一○○　　三三○○　　　——　　　二三○○　　三九○○平　遥　六○○○　　六一○○　　　——　　　四五○○　　五○○○榆　次　八○○○　　六五○○　　四○○○　　四二○○　　四○○○阳　泉　七四○○　　六七○○　　　——　　　五○○○　　　——石　庄　四四八○　　五四○○　　三○八○　　三三○○　　五七五○邢　台　五五○○　　五○二五　　　——　　　三七五○　　六二五○邯　郸　四五○○　　四六○○　　二八○○　　三三七○　　七三五○衡　水　三七○○　　四七五○　　二七六○　　三○○○　　四八○○辛　集　四八○○　　五四○○　　二七○○　　二九○○　　五四○○
    棉花　　半月来，棉价普遍下降，其原因：新棉上市多，陈棉储存量亦丰，销路不广，目前正值秋收农忙，内地纺织暂告停止。另外出口方面：自蒋匪“币制改革”后，对解放区封锁更加严厉，并企图以倾蒋美仇货，来攫取我区棉花，虽然棉花输出为敌所欢迎，但是换不回必需之物资。因之目前棉花处于内销疲落，外出无利的状态。
    土布　　九月五日前土布在出入口地带一度活跃。以后因棉粮下跌影响，再加外销不畅，布价渐趋消沉，目前所活动者，仅为纺织基础薄弱区及非产棉区，群众购置秋衣，布价稍见抬头，此外其他大部地区布价疲落。估计秋收后布价将看活跃。现将全区所产主要几种土布货牌、价格及涨落情况列下：
    广平布：邯郸每双市尺５６０元，比八月下旬跌７％，比中旬跌２０％，长治每市尺３７０元，比八月下旬升７％，平山布：每匹（幅宽一方尺，长３３——３４市尺）当地价１４、０００元比八月中旬升７．７％，冀中土布（正定产）每匹（幅宽１．１市尺，长４４市尺）中等价。北岳区市价１５、０００元，三环布（北岳砖路产）每匹（长宽同平山布，质量较差）当地售价９、７５５元，新山鹿牌洋布每匹（幅宽２．７市尺，长１１０市尺）石庄市价１４５、０００元，比八月下旬跌１２％。
    食盐　　近来雨季已过，道路修复，运输便利，食盐来源顺畅，除运输不便偏僻地区价仍高外，一般地区均平稳下跌。渤盐：德州十五日市价２５０元（北币），泊镇１８０元比八月下旬下跌１４％，邯郸十二日３２５元比八月下旬下跌５％，石庄３２０元平，北岳北部６００元左右，中部平山十五日４００元平，晋中平遥榆次渤盐８００元，潞盐７５０元价突出。潞盐：翼城２３０元平，北岳区北部一带５００元，太行腹地海盐５００元平。
    植物油　　半月来食油一般平疲，曾在中秋节前后，因过节群众需量较多一度显涨，节后，又趋消沉，由于各地群众鉴于去年油价上涨率高有利可图，故本年油料（油菜籽花生等）种植量较普遍，并因入夏以来油的出路不顺以致价落，近来各地油坊为适应群众种麦施肥（豆饼）起见，多行开始榨油，将有大批豆油涌出，价格仍看疲。兹将八月下旬至本月十五日油价涨落情况列下：
    白油：在冀中一般价在１６００—１７５０元，下跌１０—１２％，冀南以临清南宫为标准平均价１５００元平。香油：太岳郭道及晋城价１９００元。晋中新区一般食油（麻油大磨香油）２３００—２４００元。北岳区葫油，浑源涞源价均为１６５０元左右，下跌１５％。
    外货　　外来纸张因入口较多，购者少价格下落，油光纸粉连纸在冀南主要城市八月下旬至本月十二日均下落１０％。大板纸在冀鲁豫亦下跌８—９％。火柴因入口有限内地需量较大，价格上涨，石庄十五日南京火柴每包１４７０元。邯郸南京火柴货缺每包８８０元涨８０元，三光火柴每篓１９７、０００元升５％。
