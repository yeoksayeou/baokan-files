Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th: Xi'an, the largest city in Northwest China, is now a desolate hell. This is the result of Hu Zongnan's ten years of reactionary rule and his serious military crisis, especially the direct result of the Kuomintang's recent implementation of the so-called "currency reform" and "forcible price controls." In just eleven days, from August 24th to September 3rd, the Xi'an Kuomintang arrested 50 owners of businesses such as gauze merchants, stationery merchants, butchers, and barbershops, and closed down seven businesses, including Huafeng Flour Company and Xiehua Trading Company. The Xi'an market is as deserted as it has been since 1937. Yanta cloth, Daqing foreign cloth, good cigarettes, etc., are out of stock. Butchers' shops hang a few pieces of stinking meat covered with flies to pretend to be open, and it is impossible to buy a single ordinary hypodermic needle in pharmacies throughout the city. Hundreds of shops have declared closure. Xi'an is not an isolated example of this desolation. In Baoji, a major town in western Shaanxi, the Shenxin Yarn Factory does not sell yarn, the Daxin Flour Factory does not sell flour, and more than one hundred small weaving factories nearby have closed down one after another, and workers have lost their jobs. In Lintong, Jingyang, Xianyang and other places, the high-priced black market is equally prevalent. Because of the bankruptcy of currency credit, barter is mostly practiced in the market.

In ironic contrast to the Kuomintang's violent "price controls" is the fact that its state-run enterprises and tax authorities have successively raised prices and increased taxes. The Xi'an Power Plant has increased electricity charges by two and a half times since September, the Salt Administration has increased the salt tax to 24 million yuan per dan, and even the Kuomintang Higher Court has increased litigation fees.

Due to the rapid development of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, it is even more difficult for the Kuomintang to block news of the Liberated Areas from the people. The People's Liberation Army often operates within a hundred li of Xi'an. Now, not only workers, peasants, and students yearn for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, but also some merchants, because the merchants know that the Liberated Areas do not have such "economic measures" as the Kuomintang. Bold merchants often disregard the Kuomintang's heavy obstruction and robbery, and rush to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area to do business. Merchants Li Jianting and Guo Si hired six vehicles to transport their inventory to the Liberated Area. On the way, they were extorted by the Kuomintang police team, half of the goods were robbed, and eight partners were beaten to death or injured by plainclothes agents. However, thanks to the rescue of the guerrillas, they still arrived in northern Shaanxi.

### 西安一带市面荒凉　商店停业工厂关门黑市盛行人民向往我区商人多来经商

　　西安一带市面荒凉
  　商店停业工厂关门黑市盛行人民向往我区商人多来经商
    【新华社西北二十六日电】西北最大城市西安，现在是一座荒凉的地狱。这是胡宗南十年反动统治和他的严重军事危机的结果，特别是国民党最近实施所谓“货币改革”和“武力限价”的直接结果。仅在八月二十四日至九月三日的十一天内，西安国民党逮捕纱布商、文具商、肉店、理发铺等老板五十人，封闭华丰面粉公司、协华商行等商号七家。西安市场冷落为一九三七年以来所罕见。雁塔布、大青洋布、好纸烟等绝市，肉店里挂着几块钉满苍蝇的臭肉敷衍门面，走遍全市药房买不到一支普通药针。成百家的商店宣告停业。西安不是这种荒凉的单独的例子。在陕西西部重镇宝鸡，申新纱厂不售纱，大新面厂不卖面，附近一百多家小织布厂纷纷停业关门，工人失业。临潼、泾阳、咸阳等地，同样是盛行着高价的黑市。因为货币信用破产，市场上多实行物物交换。
    与国民党暴力“限价”形成讽刺性对照的，是其官营企业和税收机关纷纷涨价增税。西安电厂从九月份起电费增加两倍半，盐务管理局将每担盐税提高至二千四百万元，连国民党高等法院诉讼费也加价了。
    由于西北人民解放军的迅速发展，国民党要在人民中间封锁解放区的消息是更困难了。解放军常常活动在西安的百里内外。现在向往陕甘宁边区的不但是工人、农民和学生，而且包括一部分商人，因为商人们知道解放区没有象国民党这样的“经济措施”。大胆的商人常常不顾国民党重重阻挠抢劫，投奔到陕甘宁解放区做生意。商贩李建亭、郭思和雇了六辆车子将存货运来解放区，途中被国民党保警队勒索，货物抢去了一半，伙伴被便衣队打死打伤八人。但是由于游击队的搭救，他们仍然到了陕北。
