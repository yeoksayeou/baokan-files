　　A New Development Worth Noting in the War
    Large Numbers of Enemy Soldiers Fleeing from Isolated Cities Like Taiyuan and Changchun to Surrender to Our Army
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th】Large numbers of Kuomintang officers and soldiers in besieged cities surrendering to the People's Liberation Army—this is one of the new developments worth noting in the war. Changchun and Taiyuan are two prominent examples. In Changchun, 2,397 of the defending soldiers surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in the ten days from September 6th to 15th. Together with the figures for the 70 days prior to September 6th, the total reached 15,400, equivalent to the strength of two divisions. The surrenders during these ten days included units from the New 7th Army, the 60th Army, and the Jilin Security Brigade, a non-regular army unit. Among them were 36 field-grade and company-grade officers from the regular army. They brought with them 2 light machine guns, 25 submachine guns, 89 rifles and carbines, over 9,300 rounds of ammunition, 116 hand grenades, and 2 ammunition carts. In addition to the 250-plus men from the enemy cavalry security brigade and other units who surrendered previously, 183 men from the 52nd Division surrendered collectively this time. According to statistics from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, 45 enemy squads from Changchun have now surrendered to the unit. A reception station set up by the People's Liberation Army south of Taiyuan received 324 surrendered soldiers of the Yan Xishan army from August 15th to September 13th. Soldiers who escaped said that on August 12th, the 2nd Regiment of the Yan army's Provisional 45th Division lost more than 70 men in one night. On September 5th, 14 men deserted from the 4th Company of the 9th Security Regiment in one night. Nine soldiers from the artillery battalion of the 19th Army escaped collectively with their weapons. Lu Guozhu, a corporal from the 3rd Battalion, 6th Company of the Yan army's Provisional 46th Division, stationed in Xiangyangdian (more than 30 li north of Taiyuan), led his entire squad of soldiers to escape to the Liberated Area with their equipment.
