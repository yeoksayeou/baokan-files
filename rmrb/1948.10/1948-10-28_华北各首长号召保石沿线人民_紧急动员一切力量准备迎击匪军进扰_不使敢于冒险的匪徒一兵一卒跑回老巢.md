Xinhua News Agency, North China, 26th—In order to urgently mobilize all forces to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in annihilating the Chiang-Fu bandit troops who may intrude into the Shijiazhuang area, leading Party, government, and military officials here have issued orders to counties along the Baoding-Shijiazhuang line and on both sides of it, ordering them to mobilize all militia and local armed forces within three days, prepare all available weapons to facilitate combat, and pay particular attention to methods of fighting cavalry. It is reported that the Chiang-Fu bandits' forces intruding into the Shijiazhuang area include the 94th Army, the New 4th Cavalry Division, and the 12th Cavalry Brigade, as well as attached demolition teams and over a hundred vehicles, attempting to destroy our rear institutions, warehouses, factories, schools, power plants, and buildings. According to reports, the enemy plans to concentrate in Baoding on the 27th and begin advancing south from Baoding on the 28th. The bandit leaders of the intruding troops include Zheng Tingfeng, commander of the 94th Army, Liu Chunfang, commander of the New 4th Cavalry Division, and E You'san, commander of the 12th Cavalry Brigade (the bandit leader who intruded into Hejian this spring). Leaders here have instructed local communities not to panic. As long as everyone is adequately prepared in advance, there will be ways to avoid their destruction, lure the enemy in deep, and annihilate them. This spring, the bandits harassed Hejian, and because we were unprepared in advance, we suffered some losses, and the bandit troops were able to escape. This time, it is hoped that everyone will mobilize to fight the enemy, preventing any adventurous bandits from escaping back to their lair. In May of this year, the Yan-Fu bandits had a plan to jointly harass Shijiazhuang; the counties along the Baoding-Shijiazhuang line and the Zhengtai line were once mobilized to fight the enemy. Later, one division of the Yan bandits was annihilated in Meng County, and the Fu bandits, fearing annihilation, did not move. However, the people along the Baoding-Shijiazhuang line had the experience of one mobilization. This time, because Chiang Kai-shek is personally supervising in Beiping, the Fu bandits dare not remain idle. The North China Military Region has pointed out to the counties not to assume that because they did not come last time, they will not come this time, and not to prepare, which would lead to losses. Even if the enemy fears annihilation and does not come, it is always beneficial and harmless for us to have this kind of preparation.

　　华北各首长号召保石沿线人民
  　紧急动员一切力量准备迎击匪军进扰
  　不使敢于冒险的匪徒一兵一卒跑回老巢
    【新华社华北二十六日电】为了紧急动员一切力量，配合人民解放军歼灭可能向石家庄一带进扰的蒋傅匪军，此间党政军各首长已向保石线及其两侧各县发出命令，限于三日内动员一切民兵及地方武装，准备好一切可用的武器，以利作战，尤其注重打骑兵的方法。闻蒋傅两匪进扰石家庄一带的兵力，除九十四军外，尚有新骑四师及骑十二旅，并附属爆破队及汽车百余辆，企图捣毁我后方机关、仓库、工厂、学校、发电厂、建筑物。据息，该敌准备于二十七日集中保定，二十八日开始由保定南进。进扰部队匪首有九十四军军长郑挺锋，新编骑四师师长刘春芳，骑十二旅旅长鄂友三（即今春进扰河间之匪首）。此间首长们指示地方各界，切忽惊慌，只要大家事先有充分准备，就有办法避开其破坏，诱敌深入，聚而歼之。今春匪扰河间，因我方事先毫无准备，受到部分损失，匪部也被其逃逸。此次务希全体动员对敌，不使敢于冒险的匪徒有一兵一卒跑回其老巢。今年五月，阎傅匪曾有合扰石家庄的计划；保石线及正太线各县曾经一度动员对敌，后来阎匪一师在盂县被歼，傅匪惧歼未动，但保石线人民已有了一次动员的经验；此次因蒋匪在北平坐督，傅匪不敢不动。华北军区已向各县指出，不要以为上次未来，此次也不会来，不作准备，致受损失。即令敌人惧歼不来，我有此种准备总是有利无害。
