Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 29th – The East China Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, the East China Military Region, and the Shandong Provincial Government, have jointly telegraphed to all army corps on the front lines, celebrating the unprecedented great victory of liberating Jinan and annihilating 100,000 enemy troops, stating: The victory in Jinan not only liberated 700,000 people in the city but also more comprehensively linked the liberated areas of North China and East China; it strengthened the victorious foundation of the New Democratic construction politically and economically, and militarily made Xuzhou lose its shield, directly placing it under the threat of our artillery fire. This will affect the Central Plains and the overall war situation in the future, making the Kuomintang army even more disadvantaged, and facilitating our army to annihilate the enemy in greater numbers. It is hoped that the entire army will carry forward the successful experience and the spirit of high unity, concentration, and solidarity displayed in this campaign, avoid arrogance and underestimation, continue to expand the victory, thoroughly eliminate all the remaining enemies in East China, cooperate with the victorious advance of the national liberation army, strive for the complete liberation of East China and the whole country, fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and fight to overthrow the Chiang bandit gang and establish a New China.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 29th – The Northeast Bureau, the Northeast Military Region, the Northeast Field Army, and all commanders and fighters of the Northwest Field Army, have separately telegraphed to congratulate on the great victory in Jinan. The telegram from the Northeast Bureau and the Northeast Military Region stated: "All the soldiers and civilians in the Northeast celebrate your great victory of completely annihilating the defending enemy and liberating Jinan, which has shocked China and foreign countries, with infinite excitement. There are tens of thousands of people from Shandong in the Northeast, and they feel particularly honored and gratified by the liberation of the capital of their hometown. In the past year or so, you have overcome countless difficulties and rapidly achieved such a brilliant victory, which is a great inspiration to the soldiers and civilians in the Northeast. We will strive to fight, completely annihilate the bandit troops in the Northeast, and liberate Changchun and Shenyang to support you. We wish you continued development of victory and accelerated destruction of the Chiang bandit." The telegram from the Northeast Field Army stated: "Congratulations on your great victory in capturing Jinan and annihilating 100,000 enemy troops. Because of your capture of Jinan and the complete annihilation of the enemy defending the city, the morale of the enemy has suffered a serious blow, and their confidence in defense will inevitably be reduced again, which is more conducive to our army's future siege operations. Our Northeast Field Army is now launching an offensive on the Beining Line, preparing to annihilate a large number of enemies, and cooperate with your victory." The telegram from the Northwest Field Army stated: "We extend our congratulations with jubilation and excitement on your great victory in liberating Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, and annihilating more than 100,000 enemy troops! Your great victory further encourages us to advance bravely and fight to continue annihilating the Hu and Ma bandit gangs and liberate the Great Northwest!"

　　华东·东北·西北
    电贺解放济南
    【新华社华东前线二十九日电】中共华东中央局、华东军区、山东省政府，顷联电前线各兵团，庆祝解放济南歼敌十万的空前大捷称：济南的胜利，不仅使全市七十万人民获得解放，而且已使我华北华东各解放区更加全面的联成一片；在政治上经济上加强了新民主主义建设的胜利基础，在军事上使徐州失去屏障，直接处于我炮火威胁之下，影响今后中原与整个战局，使国民党军更加不利，便于我军更大量的歼灭敌人。尚希全军发扬此次战役中的成功经验及高度统一集中与团结友爱的精神，不骄傲轻敌，继续扩张胜利，彻底肃清华东全部残敌，配合全国解放军的胜利进军，为华东及全国人民的彻底解放而努力，打到南京去，活捉蒋介石，为打倒蒋匪帮建立新中国而奋斗。
    【新华社济南前线二十九日电】东北局、东北军区、东北野战军及西北野战军全体指战员，顷分别电贺济南大捷。东北局、东北军区贺电称：“东北全体军民，以无限兴奋心情庆祝你们全歼守敌，解放济南，威震中外的伟大胜利。东北有成千成万的人民来自山东，他们对故乡首府的解放，感到特别荣耀与欣慰。你们最近一年多来克服无数艰难，迅速完成如此辉煌胜利，对东北军民是极大的鼓舞。我们当努力奋斗，全歼东北匪军，解放长、沈以支援你们。祝继续发展胜利，加速蒋贼灭亡。”东北野战军贺电称：“庆祝你们攻占济南歼敌十万的伟大胜利。由于你们的攻占济南，并全部歼灭守城之敌，使敌方士气遭此严重打击之后，其守备信心势必再度降低，这就更有利于我军今后的攻坚作战。我东北野战军现正在北宁线上发动攻势，准备大量歼灭敌人，配合你们的胜利。”西北野战军贺电称：“我们谨以欢腾鼓舞之情，庆祝你们解放山东省会济南，歼敌十万余人的伟大胜利！你们的大胜，更鼓舞我们奋勇前进，为继续歼灭胡、马匪帮，解放大西北而战。”
