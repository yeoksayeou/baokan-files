　　Pengcheng Porcelain Industry Introduction

　　Pengcheng Town belongs to Cixian County, Hebei Province, located in the western part of the county, where the Fuyang River originates, at the junction of mountainous and plain areas. The whole town has 2,438 households and 9,484 people, liberated on August 18, 1945. The town has been famous for its porcelain industry since the Tang and Song Dynasties, with only three porcelain kilns at that time; it developed greatly in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties. The raw materials, except for foreign blue (color), and bowl soil (alkali) were produced in nearby villages. Before the war, there were more than 300 vat and bowl kilns, with more than 200 kiln owners. The most prosperous period was before the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), when there were 204 bowl kilns and 50 vat kilns in operation, totaling 254. There were more than 5,000 skilled workers, plus apprentices and laborers, totaling more than 10,000 people. Each bowl kiln produced an average of eight to ten firings of goods per year, totaling 1,632 to 2,040 firings per year; each firing averaged about 4,000 "yue," totaling 6,528,000 to 8,160,000 "yue" (each "yue" being twelve bowls). The products were sold throughout Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, as well as parts of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Northeast China, and Hong Kong, with an estimated buying population of about 100 million. At that time, the town had more than 30 porcelain goods inns. More than 200 merchants from Tianjin, Shanghai, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and other places lived here, and a pre-order system of paying before taking delivery was implemented. It was once known as "Southern Jingdezhen and Northern Pengcheng." Later, the quality of Tangshan porcelain industry in Hebei continued to improve, and the porcelain industries of Jingxing and Boshan in Shandong developed rapidly, affecting the Pengcheng porcelain industry. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, the town still had more than 200 kilns; later, due to enemy destruction, only about 100 bowl kilns and more than 20 vat kilns remained. After the enemy occupied Pengcheng, only 100 vat and bowl kilns remained (80 bowl kilns and 20 vat kilns), and the number of workers was reduced to 2,000. In the early days of the War of Resistance, more than 1,000 porcelain workers participated in the war, and the porcelain industry gradually collapsed. By the time of liberation in 1945, there were only 43 vat and bowl kilns (including 5 vat kilns) and 600 workers. After liberation, the democratic government issued porcelain industry loans of 25 million yuan and invested 31.31 million yuan to vigorously support the industry and promote labor-capital cooperation. At that time, kiln owners also had private capital of 20.06 million yuan, so the porcelain industry recovered somewhat. According to statistics in 1946, there were 54 bowl kilns (27 households) and 11 vat kilns (10 households), totaling 65 kilns. There were 1,044 workers, including wheel workers, potters, and painters. As the war moved to the outer lines and transportation became more convenient, porcelain goods were transported to Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, Handan, Quzhou, Guantao, Linqing, Hengshui, Linzhang, Neihuang, and Puyang, and the porcelain industry gradually recovered. To date, the area has 69 bowl kilns (including 15 newly added) and 14 vat kilns (including 3 newly added), totaling 83 vat and bowl kilns (including 11 state-owned, 3 joint state-private, 28 private, and 41 cooperative). The capital is over 169.4 million yuan (self-reported figures are inaccurate), including over 8.47 million yuan of state-owned capital, over 43.39 million yuan of private capital, 13.5 million yuan of state loans, and 27.79 million yuan of other investments from the government, banks, and the masses. There are 1,544 workers. To facilitate the sale of finished products, most areas within a hundred li (such as Handan and Ci) have porcelain goods sales offices, and sales are currently very good, with demand exceeding supply. With the recovery of the porcelain industry, Pengcheng Town's industry and commerce have also developed accordingly. There are currently 240 resident merchants, 170 itinerant merchants and vendors, and 301 handicraft workshops, totaling 711 households, with a capital of over 481.09 million yuan.

　　The problems existing in the local porcelain industry are: (1) The improperly handled kiln confiscations have not been fully addressed, causing many capitalists to avoid repairing and constructing kilns, choosing instead to move to other kilns when their own are damaged. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the Party's policy on industry and commerce, continue to complete the corrective measures, and pay attention to kiln construction. (2) Egalitarianism exists in wages, which discourages skilled workers and limits the improvement of productivity. At the same time, the "leftist" tendencies in the workers' movement have created abnormal labor-capital relations, which also hinders the recovery and development of the kiln industry. (3) Most of the skilled workers are from Huguan County, are technically conservative, and do not easily pass on their skills, especially not to local people. It is necessary to strengthen workers' political and ideological education, promote respect for teachers and love for apprentices, and encourage them to take on more apprentices. In addition, it is also necessary to improve technology to compete with porcelain goods from other places in the market. (Taihang Telegram)

　　彭城瓷业介绍
    彭城镇属河北省磁县，位于县城西部，滏阳河发源于此，地处山地平原接连地带。全镇二四三八户，九四八四人，一九四五年八月十八日解放。该镇素以瓷业著称，始于唐宋，当时只三个瓷窑；明末清初大量发展起来，原料除洋青（颜色）外，碗土（硷子）皆附近村庄所产。战前共缸碗窑三百多，窑主二百多。民国廿年以前为最盛时期，开工的碗窑有二零四座，缸窑五十座，共二百五十四座，技术工人有五千多，加上见习生杂工等达万余人。每座碗窑平均年产八到十窑货，全年共可产一千六百三十二——二千零四十窑；每窑平均以四千约计算，共可出六百五十二万八千八百一十六万约（每约十二个碗）。销售于冀、鲁、豫全省及晋、陕、东北、香港一部地区，购货者估计约有一万万人口。当时该镇设有卅多个瓷货客栈，天津、上海、开封、郑州等地，客商二百余住此，且实行先交钱后取货的预订制，曾有南景德北彭城之称。后河北唐山瓷业质量不断提高，井陉及山东博山瓷业日益发展，彭城瓷业受到了影响。一九三七年抗战初期，该镇仍有窑二百余；后因受敌摧残，剩碗窑百余座，缸窑二十余座。敌估彭城后，缸碗窑仅剩百座（碗窑八十缸窑二十），工人减到两千狡名。抗战初期，该地曾有瓷业工人千余参加抗战，此后瓷业逐渐垮台。至一九四五年解放前，仅有缸碗窑四十三座（内缸窑五座），工人六百个。解放后，民主政府发放瓷业贷款两千五百万元，公家投资三一三一万元，大力扶植，提倡劳资合作，当时另有窑主私人资本二零零六万元，因之瓷业有些恢复。据一九四六年统计：有五十四座碗窑（二十七户），十一座缸窑（十户），共六十五座。有轮工、陶工、画工等各种工人一零四四人。由于战争推向外线，交通较前便利，瓷货运销达石庄、邢台、邯郸、曲周、管陶、临清、衡水、临漳、内黄及濮阳等地，瓷业逐渐恢复。至今该地有碗窑六十九座（内新增十五座），缸窑十四座（内新增三座），总计共有缸碗窑八十三座（其中公营十一，公私合营三，私营廿八，合作经营四十一）。资金一万万六千九百四十余万元（为自报数不确），内公营资金八四七万余元，私资四三三九万余元，公家贷款一三五零万元，其他如政府、银行、群众投资二七七九万余元。工人一五四四人。为便于成品推销，近百里（如邯、磁等）地区内，大部设有瓷货推销处，现销路很好，出货供不应求。随着瓷业的恢复，彭城镇的工商业也随之发展起来，现有座商二四零户，行商摊贩一七零户，手工业作坊三零一户，共七一一户，资金四八一零九万余元。
    该地瓷业存在的问题：（一）乱斗了的瓷窑业尚没完成退补，致资方多不修理建设瓷窑，这个窑坏了另移他窑烧。故今后须贯彻党的工商业政策，继续完成退补，并注意瓷窑建设。（二）工资上存在着平均主义，致技术工人不积极，限制生产力的提高。同时由于职工运动中的左的倾向，使劳资关系不正常，亦阻碍着瓷窑业的恢复与发展。（三）技术工人多为壶关人，技术保守，不轻易传人，特别不传当地人。须加强工人政治思想教育，提倡尊师爱徒，鼓励多带徒弟。此外更须提高技术，以与外地瓷货竞争市场。　　　（太行电）
