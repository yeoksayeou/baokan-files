Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS reports: Vyshinsky's nine-thousand-word speech, the head of the Soviet delegation, was the central event of the United Nations General Assembly on the 25th. On that day, the entire assembly hall was full, and many representatives from the press and public organizations attended. When Vyshinsky appeared on the podium, welcoming applause continued for a long time. The participants listened to his fluent and factually grounded speech with keen attention. Vyshinsky's speech first broadly reviewed the activities of the United Nations, pointing out that the most important resolutions had not been implemented, and the majority of countries systematically violated the Charter, thereby causing serious setbacks and failures for the United Nations. This situation was caused by the policies followed by the United States in the entire work of the United Nations. The main part of Vyshinsky's speech was his analysis of current international relations, especially the policies of U.S. imperialism. Vyshinsky pointed out that in recent years, the policy of the United States has changed to a policy of expansion and the implementation of plans for world hegemony. It is inciting war psychology, its new war propaganda is becoming increasingly intense, and it is also accompanied by a feverish arms race and elaborately crafted plans to attack the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. Vyshinsky was interrupted by enthusiastic applause when he exposed the anti-Soviet war propaganda of the leading figures in the United States. He also received enthusiastic approval when he spoke of the Soviet Union's firm defense of the cause of peace and security for all countries. In concluding his speech, Vyshinsky put forward three proposals: first, the five permanent members of the Security Council (Soviet Union, United States, Britain, France, China) should reduce their existing naval, land, and air forces by one-third within one year; second, atomic weapons should be banned; third, an international control agency should be established in the Security Council to supervise and control the implementation of disarmament and the ban on atomic weapons.
　　
According to Agence France-Presse: Vyshinsky's successful speech was praised by world opinion. "Representatives of many large and small countries were deeply moved by the facts cited by Vyshinsky from American publications calling for a new war." "Despite the fact that the guest cards stated that no expressions were allowed during the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly, frequent and loud applause, mixed with various expressions of approval, still came from the audience seats, which became a characteristic of Vyshinsky's speech."

　　在联合国大会上
    维辛斯基发表演说
    分析国际关系抨击美帝政策建议缩减军备禁止原子武器
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社报导：苏联代表团长维辛斯基长达九千言的演说，是二十五日联合国大会的中心事件。是日，大会全场满座，报界及各公共社团的许多代表均到会。当维辛斯基出现于讲坛时，欢迎的掌声经久不息。与会者以锐利的注意来听取他的流畅而立场确实的演说。维辛斯基的演说首先广泛检讨联合国的活动，他指出，最重要的决议未被执行，多数国家有系统地违背宪章，从而造成了联合国严重的挫折与失败，而这种情势的造成，是由于美国在联合国整个工作中所遵循的政策。维辛斯基演说的主要部分，是他对目前国际关系，特别是对美帝国主义政策的分析。维辛斯基指出，近几年来，美国的政策已经改变为扩张与实现世界霸权计划的政策，它正在煽动战争心理，它的新战争宣传愈来愈强烈，而且，还伴随着有狂热的军备竞赛和精心制作的意图进攻苏联及新民主主义国家的计划。维辛斯基于揭露美国首要人物的反苏战争宣传时，为热烈的掌声所打断。他在谈到苏联坚决保卫各国和平与安全事业时也受到热烈的赞同。维辛斯基在结束演说时提出三点建议：第一，安理会五常任理事国（苏、美、英、法、中）在一年之内将现有海陆空军缩减三分之一；第二，禁止原子武器；第三，在安理会中建立国际管制机构，以监督与管制裁军与禁止原子武器措施的实行。
    另据法新社报导：维辛斯基成功的演说，为世界舆论交口称道。“许多大小国家的代表，都被维辛斯基从美国刊物中引用的号召新战争的事实所深深感动。”“尽管来宾卡片上写明在联合国大会的进程中不准有所表示，但频频而响亮的掌声，夹杂着各种各样赞许的表示，仍自听众座席中传来，成为维辛斯基演说的特点。”（演说全文不日即可发表。——编者）
