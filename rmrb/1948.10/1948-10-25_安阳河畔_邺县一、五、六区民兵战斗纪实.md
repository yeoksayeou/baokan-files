  　I. Sheltering and Rescuing the Masses Amidst a Hail of Bullets

    On the evening of August 27th, intelligence was received that the enemy's 40th Division was assembling troops and "would launch an attack on us tomorrow." Our main force units were then strategically transferred behind enemy lines to annihilate the enemy, and the militia of the First, Fifth, and Sixth Districts gloriously undertook the combat mission of blocking the enemy on the southern front.

    On the dawn of the 28th, Comrades Zhao Shun and Chen Zhi of the Sixth District militia were ordered to scout the situation to the west. When they reached the west side of Zhaoqi Village, they discovered many people running eastward in a panic. To their north, there were many troops wearing grass-green uniforms rapidly moving east. They determined that these must be the enemy. They said, "We must fire the first shot to cover the evacuation of the masses." Pata-pata bullets flew towards the enemy. The enemy immediately concentrated their machine guns and rifles on them. They fought and retreated back to the Chengqi Village sub-command, giving the surrounding villages time to prepare. When the masses in Zhaoqi Village, Fifth District, heard the gunfire and went outside, they saw that the enemy had already reached the west entrance of the village, so they quickly moved to the east bank of the Anyang River. Yang Jinwang and five other militiamen from the village also ran east with the masses. Cheng Yiping, the head of the self-defense force, saw them and shouted, "You're holding guns! If you don't fight now, when will you? What does it matter if you die to save the masses!" His words reminded the militiamen. The six of them turned back and opened fire on the enemy, bravely advancing and stopping the enemy, allowing most of the masses to evacuate safely. When the enemy entered Chengqi Village, which was located on the west bank of the Anyang River, Cheng Yubao, the chairman of the Chengqi Village peasant association, and four militiamen, in order to cover the masses, left their parents and wives behind, braved the enemy's fierce fire, and bravely advanced to block the enemy, which enabled most of the villagers to cross the river. As they reached the riverbank, they suddenly saw a thirteen-year-old girl from their village sitting there, holding her father's rifle and a bag of bullets. She was unable to advance or retreat due to the enemy's artillery fire. She shouted at them, "My dad went to the field and hasn't returned. I took out the gun." They quickly helped her across the river. The enemy's 40th Division and bandits, a total of six or seven hundred men, attacked the Xianxiao Bridge in the lower reaches of the Anyang River from the direction of Wadianji. The enemy was about to rush to the west bank of the river, and their firepower was very strong. However, at this time, there were still over a thousand masses, supporting the old and carrying the young, and more than three hundred head of livestock that had not crossed the bridge. Comrades Zhang Yusheng and Wang Fusheng of the Fifth District immediately led the joint defense militia of Qicun Village and stubbornly rushed to the northeast corner of the west bank of the river, firing at the enemy from the flank. The enemy immediately went prone. We further organized firepower to suppress the enemy, and the masses were able to cross the river completely.

    After the enemy's battalion advanced to the small temple east of Chengqi Village, we had completed the deployment of our position on the east bank of the Anyang River. The enemy then organized fire to sweep the east side of the river, while sending small armed groups to try to cross the river by force. Our command ordered the immediate demolition of the bridge. Only two planks were removed before the enemy occupied the west bank of the river, only thirty or forty meters away from our position. At this time, an old woman, two women, and two little girls walked to the east end of the bridge. When they saw that the bridge had been demolished, they could not advance or retreat and were just crying. Comrades Huang Shouhe and Lu Zhanrong of the Sixth District militia, as if they had seen their relatives, braved the enemy's fire and rescued the five women across the river. After carrying two people across, Lu Zhanrong was unable to raise his head due to the enemy's dense fire, so he lay down and held the bridgehead, and withdrew under the cover of nightfall until dark.

    II. Heroic and Resourceful Tactics

    After our three districts deployed their positions on the east bank of the Anyang River, the enemy had occupied the small temple east of Chengqi Village, and part of them had moved to the riverbank. The two sides were only separated by the Anyang River, about forty meters wide, and a fierce exchange of fire began. Liu Suozi, Zhao Ruyan, Cheng Qiubao, Yucheng, and other five militiamen from the Fifth District were ordered to guard the bridgehead and launched a cold-shot battle. Comrade Qiubao saw two enemies on the west bank. He leveled his rifle, took aim, and one enemy fell in response. The other ran away like a rabbit. The enemy got angry and fired a burst of machine-gun fire at him. Qiubao's bayonet was broken. He cleverly lay prone in the ditch without moving. When the machine gun stopped, he looked up and saw five or six enemies moving along the riverbank, searching for targets. He aimed and fired another shot, and he heard a scream of "Mommy!" from the opposite bank, and one person fell to the ground. The others scattered and fled for their lives.

    Under the fiery early autumn sun, the first squad of eighteen men from the First District, guarding the Anyang River, fought fiercely under the leadership of Squad Leader Zhou Guangde. They cleverly topped their heads and wrapped their bodies with green grass and green bean stalks, disguising themselves to look like bean plants. Everyone gripped their rifles tightly, staring intently ahead, monitoring the enemy's every move. The enemy on the opposite bank used newly built fortifications, set up three machine guns, and fired continuously, covering more than a hundred enemies who were inching forward, attempting to charge across the river. The atmosphere was tense, as if it were about to explode. When the enemy advanced to the west bank of the river, the enemy's machine guns fired as densely as raindrops. Several enemies cautiously came to the bridge, obviously trying to cross the river. Our Squad Leader Zhou shouted, "Comrades, fire!" A burst of machine-gun fire went over, and the enemies retracted their heads like turtles. Yang Tianzhao discovered that the enemy's machine-gun position was under a mulberry tree, so he straightened his machine gun, aimed at the enemy, and fired ten rounds, scaring the enemy's machine gun into hiding immediately. After a while, the enemy secretly hid their machine gun in a large pile of sorghum stalks and swept at us, but was again discovered by Comrade Yang, who fired another burst at the enemy, and the enemy's machine gun went silent again. Wu Jinfu, a machine gunner from the Second Squad, used his machine gun, which could not fire continuously, to block the river mouth. He mobilized everyone, "We must use cold shots to hit the enemy, not let the enemy show their heads," and guaranteed to everyone: "With my broken machine gun, I guarantee the enemy will not be able to cross the river." This encouraged everyone to become even bolder.

    Fan Guangqi, secretary of the First District Committee, and militiaman Wang Ni'er, thinking of consuming the enemy's bullets, used sorghum stalks to hold up their hats. The enemy was indeed fooled, da, da, da, sending over a dozen bursts of bullets. Everyone laughed in a burst, but they did not laugh out loud. Later, many comrades coincidentally lined up their hats, and the enemy fired even more frantically, like "Zhuge Liang borrowing arrows," causing the enemy to consume many of their bullets. Later, the enemy realized that the more they fired, the more people there seemed to be, so they concentrated machine-gun firepower, but they still couldn't break through. Finally, they used artillery and rifle grenades to fire at us. Squad Leader Liu Wensheng saw the enemy firing artillery, and while directing everyone to take cover, he shouted, "Comrades! Stay calm, artillery is not scary," which boosted morale. Everyone quickly dispersed and took cover, suffering no damage. The enemy of six or seven hundred men on the southern road, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, pounced on the Xianxiao Bridge on the east side of the river. Part of our Fifth District militia, in coordination with the Zhangnan militia, bravely resisted. After all the masses had been evacuated, everyone moved to a new position.

    III. Moving Political Appeals

    During the fierce battle, suddenly we heard Comrade Ma Jinxiao of the Sixth District shouting, "Fellow villagers! We are all poor people, and all the poor people in the world are one family, why should we risk our lives for Chiang Kai-shek?" Inspired by his words, a propaganda campaign quickly broke out along the entire line: "The guns belong to Chiang Kai-shek, but your lives are your own, think about it!" "Kaifeng can't even be defended, can Zhangde be defended?" "We have a lenient policy, you are all welcome back." The enemy's artillery fire suddenly became sparse, as if they were listening quietly. Some comrades were asking the enemy: "You have all been conscripted, your parents and wives are at home crying with empty stomachs, thinking of you! Don't you know? Why don't you come back to divide the land?" "Think about who you are risking your lives for? What will be the result in the future?"...The gunfire became even more silent. Some comrades took out the good news from Qimen and Xiqugou and read them to the enemy. Zhang Tinggui, the secretary of the Sixth District Committee, took out the record of the People's Liberation Army's two years of victories and read it out loudly, until his voice became hoarse. The appeals lasted for more than an hour, overwhelming the enemy's firepower. The sun passed noon, and the cooks brought steamed buns and boiled water. Li Xiaosheng, a comrade from the First District, shouted: "Hey! We are eating steamed buns, do you want to eat some?" "Throw one over to us!" enemy soldiers begged us. An enemy officer happened to walk by, saw the soldiers talking to us, got angry and shouted: "Damn it! Bring it to us!" "Okay, we'll send you two," Li Yousheng, a militiaman from the First District, shouted, while aiming a small cannon at the officer, "Boom," "Boom" twice, dust flew up, but the enemy officer's shadow could not be seen.

    IV. Profound Friendship and Unyielding Fighting Spirit

    The comrades on the battlefield were especially close, Zhang Liangzu, a comrade from the Second Squad of the Sixth District guarding the bridgehead, was suddenly shot through his ribs, severely wounded. The militiamen rushed to rescue him and comforted him, saying: "No matter how the enemy shoots, we will send you down." He encouraged the comrades with firmness, saying: "This is nothing, I will be better in just over ten days, comrades, hurry up and fight! Don't worry about me." Comrade Wang Huabin of the Sixth District Committee and the communications soldier delivered soup and food amidst the flying bullets. A profound class friendship and mutual assistance permeated among the comrades.

    Everyone's fighting spirit was as strong as steel. The Second Squad of the Sixth District, besides the two stretcher bearers and escorts, only had four or five people left. The enemy was firing intensely, but they were not afraid at all. Wang Yufu and Ma Jinxiao said, "The superiors told us to guard the bridgehead, and we will never retreat." Squad Leader Wang Yonglu said, "We must save our bullets, not fire unless we see the enemy, and use cold shots to kill the enemy." They encouraged each other, fought bravely, and no matter how the enemy's machine guns and rifles roared, they could not make them take a step back.

    V. Victorious Transfer

    From early morning to nightfall, after persevering for an entire day, our side, with only one hundred militiamen, resisted the enemy's 40th Division's two battalions and a group of bandits, totaling more than a thousand men. The task of blocking the enemy was gloriously completed, and the county sub-command decided to transfer to a new position. Comrades Cui Li and others from the First District militia received the order to "guard the riverbank and cover everyone's transfer." Comrade Cui and the other four discussed and decided to "give the enemy a confusing array." They scattered along the long riverbank, firing one shot here and then firing two shots in another corner, confusing the enemy so that they did not know how many people we had. They persisted for forty minutes, and the transfer was safely completed.

    On the way, one comrade could not walk anymore, so Zhang Pei, the district head of the Sixth District, carried his gun for him. Wang Yonglu, the leader of the Second Squad, carried three rifles on his back, walked more than twenty li, and did not say a word of fatigue.

　　安阳河畔
   ——邺县一、五、六区民兵战斗纪实
    王风亭　马志敏
  　皇甫善　马进新
  　一、枪林弹雨中掩护和抢救群众
    八月二十七日晚，接到了敌四十师集结部队，“将于明日向我进犯”的情报。我主力某部即有计划的转到敌后歼敌去了，一、五、六区民兵光荣的担负了在南线正面阻击的战斗任务。
    六区民兵赵顺、陈志两同志，在二十八日拂晓，奉命到西边侦察情况，走到赵奇村西面，发现许多群众慌忙的向东跑，在他们的北面有很多身穿草绿色军服的队伍在迅速的向东运动，他们判定必是敌人，他们说：“咱一定要打响，好掩护群众转移”。拍拍的子弹飞向敌方，敌人的机步枪立刻集中向他们射击，他俩边打边退地跑回了程奇村分指挥部，使周围村的群众得到了准备的时间。五区赵奇村的群众听到枪声出门一看，敌已到了村西口，就迅速向安阳河东岸转移，该村民兵杨金旺等六人，也跟群众一起向东跑，自卫队长程一平看见了就喊：“你们拿着枪，这时不打，啥时才打？为了救群众，死了算个啥！”一句话提醒了民兵，他六人反过身来，就向敌开了火，勇敢的向前跃进，阻止了敌人，使群众大部安全转移了。当敌进入傍安阳河西岸的程奇村时，该村农会主席程玉保和四个民兵，为了掩护群众，丢下了自己的父母妻子，即冒着敌激烈的射击，英勇向前阻击敌人，才使该村群众大部过了河。他们走到河岸上，忽看见本村一个十三岁的小女孩抱着她父亲的步枪，布袋里装着子弹，坐在那里，因敌炮火所挡，进退不得，向他们喊：“我爹去地没回来，枪被我拿出来了”。他们很快送她过了河。南边的敌四十师和土匪共六七百人，由瓦店集方向，向我安阳河的下游贤孝桥进攻，敌将冲到河西岸，而且火力很强，可是这时还有扶老携幼的千余群众和三百多头牲口没有过了桥。五区区委张玉生、王福生两同志，即带领奇村联防民兵，顽强的冲到河西的东北角落，从侧面向敌射击，敌人马上便卧倒了，我更组织火力压住敌人，群众才得全部过了河。
    当敌一营兵力进到程奇村后，我已完成了安阳河东岸的阵地布署。敌便一面组织火力向河东扫射，一面派小股武装企图抢渡。我指挥部命令立即拆桥，才拆掉了两块板，敌即占领了河西岸，距我阵地只三四十米，这时一个老太太和两个妇女两个小女孩走到桥东头，一看桥拆了，退不能进不得，只在哭叫着，六区民兵黄守合和鲁占荣好象见了亲人一样冒着敌人的扫射，把五个妇女抢救过河了，鲁占荣在背过了两个人以后，被敌密集的火力打得抬不起头来，便卧倒就地坚持，把守桥口，到天黑才趁夜色的掩护撤了下来。
    二、英勇机智的战术
    当我三个区在安阳河东岸布好阵地后，敌已占领了程奇村东的小庙，一部已运动到河岸，两边仅隔一条约四十米远的安阳河，双方展开火力猛烈的射击，五区民兵刘索子、赵如彦、程秋保、玉成等五人，奉命把守了桥口，展开了冷枪战，秋保同志看到西岸有两个敌人，他便顺过枪杆，瞄了瞄，一个敌人应声倒地，另一个兔子似的跑了。敌人动了气，机枪对准他就打了一梭子，秋保刺刀被打坏了，他就机警的伏在沟里不动，机枪一停，他抬头看见五六个敌人在河岸上游动，寻找目标，他又瞄准打了一枪，只听对岸“娘呀”一声，一人扑地而倒，其它都乱窜逃命了。
    在火一般的初秋的阳光下，我一区守安阳河的第一班十八个人，在班长周光德同志率领下紧张的战斗着，他们巧妙的将青草和青豆秆子顶在头上，缠在身上，把自己伪装的活象一棵豆禾。个个双手紧握着步枪，目不转睛的盯着前方，监视敌人的一举一动，河对岸的敌人利用新修的工事，架着三挺机枪，不停的射着，掩护着百余敌人向前蠕动，企图冲锋过河。空气紧张，好象要爆炸的样子。当敌进到河西边的时候，敌机枪射得象雨点的稠密，几个敌人探头探脑的来到桥边，显然是试图过河。我周班长喊着：“同志们，快打！”一阵机步枪打过去，敌人象乌龟一样缩回头去了。杨天昭发现了桑树下是敌机枪阵地，便摆正了自己的机枪，瞄准敌人打了十发，吓得敌机枪马上隐藏了。一会，敌又将机枪偷偷的藏到一大堆高粱秆里向我扫射，又被杨同志发觉，朝着敌人又打了一梭子，敌机枪又哑吧了。二班机枪射手吴进富同志，用自己不能连发的机枪，封住了河口，他动员大家，“要用冷枪打敌人，不让敌人露头”，并向大家保证：“有我这挺破机枪，保证敌人过不了河”。鼓舞的大家更胆壮起来。
    一区分委范光其和民兵王妮的，想着消耗敌人的子弹，用高粱秆把帽子举起来。敌人果然中计，哒，哒，哒，送来了十几梭子弹，大家一阵乱笑，但都没有笑出声来。后来许多同志不约而同的将帽子排起来，敌更疯狂的扫射，象“孔明借箭”一样，使敌人消耗了他许多子弹。后来敌发觉越打人越多，集中机步枪火力还是打不下去，最后用炮和枪榴弹向我发射。小队长刘文生同志看到敌人发炮，一面指挥大家隐蔽，一面喊：“同志们！沉住气，炮是不可怕的”，鼓舞了斗志。大家迅速散开隐蔽，未受丝毫损伤。南路之敌六七百人，在猛烈炮火掩护下向河东贤孝桥猛扑，我五区民兵一部，配合漳南民兵英勇阻击，在群众全部转移后，大家才转入新阵地。
    三、动人的政治喊话
    正在激战时，忽然听到六区马进孝同志在喊叫：“老乡们！咱们都是穷人，天下穷人是一家，为啥要替蒋介石卖命？”在他的启示下，全线迅速爆发了宣传运动：“枪是蒋介石的，命是自己的，你们想一想呀！”“开封还守不住，彰德能守住吗？”“我们是宽大政策，回来都欢迎”。敌人的炮火忽然稀疏了，似乎在静静的听，有的同志在向敌发问：“你们都是被抓的，你们的爹娘妻子在家里饿着肚子哭哭啼啼想你哩！你们不知道吗？为什么不回来分土地？”“你们想想为谁卖命？将来干个啥结果？”……………枪声更沉寂下来了。有的同志拿出了淇门和西曲沟的捷报念给敌人听，六区区委张廷贵同志又拿出解放军二周年战绩高声的读，喊的嗓子也哑了，喊话持续一个多钟头，压倒了敌人的火力。太阳过午了，炊事员送来馍和开水，一区李小生同志喊着：“喂！我们吃的是馍，你们吃不吃！”“给我们扔过一个来吧！”敌士兵向我们哀求着。敌军官恰好走来了，看到士兵与我对话，生了气喊着：“妈的！给我们送来吧！”“好，给你们送去两个”，一区民兵李有生一面喊着，一面用小炮瞄准军官“轰”“轰”两声，尘土飞起，却看不见敌军官的影子了。
    四、高度的友爱和坚强的斗志
    战场上的同志们是格外的亲热，把守桥口的六区二小队张良祖同志，忽然被子弹打穿了肋下，伤势很重，民兵抢着把他救护下来，并安慰他说：“不管敌人怎样打，也要把你送下去”。他反刚毅的鼓舞着同志们说：“这算个啥，不过十多天就好了，同志们赶快打吧！别担心我。”六区区委王化彬同志和通信员，在子弹纷飞中送汤送饭，同志们中间洋溢着高度的阶级友爱互助的感情。
    大家的斗志象钢铁般的坚强。六区二小队除去两个彩号和护送的人以外，只留四五个人了，敌人在集中射击，他们一点也不畏惧。王玉付、马进孝说：“上级叫咱们守桥口，我们绝不退却。”小队长王永禄说：“咱们要节省子弹，不见敌人不打，要用冷枪杀伤敌人。”他们互相鼓舞着，坚强的战斗着，不管敌机步枪怎样狂叫，也不能使他们后退一步。
    　　　　五、胜利的转移
    从清早到天黑，坚持了一个整天，我方只有一百个民兵就抗击了敌四十师两个营及一部土匪共千余人的兵力。阻击的任务是光荣的完成了，县分指决定转移新阵地。一区民兵崔礼同志等五人接到了“把守河岸，掩护大家转移”的命令。崔同志五人商量定“给敌一个迷魂阵”，他们散开在长长的河岸上，一会在这里打一枪，一会又到另一角落里打两枪，弄的敌人也不知我们有多少人，一直坚持了四十分钟，就这样安全的全部转移了。
    路上一个同志走不动了，六区区长张佩同志便替他背上了枪。二小队长王永禄同志一人背了三支步枪，走了二十多里，也没说一句疲劳的话。
