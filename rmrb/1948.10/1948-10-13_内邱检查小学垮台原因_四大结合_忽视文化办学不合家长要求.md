　　Neiqiu Examines the Reasons for Elementary School Collapse
    "Four Great Combinations" Neglect Cultural Education, Do Not Meet Parents' Requirements
    [Taihang News] Neiqiu has a total of 250 administrative villages, 195 elementary schools, and 220 current teachers (excluding higher elementary). There are 13,120 school-age children in the county. According to statistics from the first half of this year, 10,632 children were enrolled, but only 4,384 attended regularly, accounting for 33% of school-age children. In Guanzhuang, out of more than 300 students, only 20 or so attend school each day. Sometimes only five or six. Of the six elementary schools in Chengguan, four have collapsed. Recently, after inspection by county leaders, the main reasons for the collapse are: (1) There was a deviation in the implementation of the education policy, which violated the basic requirements of parents: In the past, elementary school education emphasized the "four great combinations," neglecting children's cultural learning and focusing solely on production and central tasks. Last year, county leaders called on schools to be self-sufficient, and many elementary schools planted more than ten mu of land, using student labor to manage it. Schools organized mutual aid groups, weaving groups, cooperatives, messenger groups, preferential treatment for soldiers' families groups, and theatrical troupes, and also organized students to collect firewood and sell it to buy stationery. Parents reflected: "Since they are going to school, who can't afford pens and ink? It delays their time and they can't learn to read, so it's better to produce at home." Tiejiangtun Elementary School twisted the Yangge dance all day long, and the masses reflected: "They are driving the students crazy." (2) Since the Three Check-ups last year, teachers from unfavorable backgrounds have carried the burden of their class status, are not bold in their work, fear students' opinions, and are unpopular. New teachers have little experience and low ability, and most cannot manage children. Students are extremely democratic and undisciplined, not listening to teachers at school and not listening to parents at home. Parents are dissatisfied and do not send their children to school. (3) More importantly, county leaders do not conduct in-depth leadership and inspection of education work, listen to rumors, and arbitrarily transfer teachers. Teachers are not praised for doing good work, nor are they criticized for doing bad work, so they have no motivation to work.
    Based on the above reasons, county leaders have now made specific studies and are determined to carry out rectification during the autumn vacation training, and have initially made the following decisions: (1) Strengthen leadership over education work and overcome the bureaucratic style of not being thorough and not inspecting. (2) Conduct screening and grading during the autumn vacation teacher training. Clean up teachers who are too low in culture and incompetent, and help them to pursue further education or change careers. (3) Continue to implement the correction of deviations and clarify the education policy. (4) Solve teachers' difficulties, rectify schools, and put forward specific requirements for teachers' work.

　　内邱检查小学垮台原因
    “四大结合”忽视文化办学不合家长要求
    【太行讯】内邱共有二五○个行政村，一九五座小学，二二○个现任教员（高小未计），全县学龄儿童一三一男二个。据今年前半年统计，入校儿童一○六三二名，经常到校的只四三八四名，占学龄儿童百分之三三。关庄三○○多学生，每天到校不过二○多个。有时只五、六个。城关六个小学，四个垮了台。最近经县领导上检查，垮台的主要原因是：（一）执行教育方针上出了偏向，违背了家长基本要求：过去小学教育强调“四大结合”，忽视儿童文化学习，光搞生产及中心工作。去年县领导上号召学校自给，很多小学都种有十来亩地，以学生劳力来经营。在学校组织互助组、纺织组、合作社、送信组、优抗组、剧团等，又组织学生打柴，卖下钱买文具。家长反映：“既上学，谁还买不起笔墨呢？耽误了工夫识不下字，还不如在家生产哩。”铁匠屯小学整天扭秧歌，群众反映：“把学生都扭疯啦。”（二）去年三查以来，出身不好的教员背上了成份包袱，工作不大胆，怕学生提意见，吃不开。新教员经验少，能力低，多不会管理儿童，学生极端民主，自由散漫，在校不听教员话，回家不听家长话。家长不满意，不送子女入学。（三）更重要的是县领导上对教育工作领导不深入，不检查，道听途说，乱调换教员。教员做好受不到表扬，做坏受不到批评，干得没劲。
    根据以上原因，县领导上现已作了具体研究，决心在秋假集训当中进行整顿，并初步作出以下决定：（一）加强对教育工作领导，克服不深入不检查的官僚主义作风。（二）秋假教员集训，进行甄别，分出等级。对文化太低、不称职教员进行清洗，帮助其升学或转业。（三）继续贯彻纠偏，明确教育方针。（四）解决教员困难，整顿学校，提出对教员工作具体要求。　　　　　（郭玉栋）
