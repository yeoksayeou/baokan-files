Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Front, 18th: The entire three divisions of the 60th Army of the Kuomintang (KMT) garrison in Changchun (the Provisional 21st Division, the 182nd Division, and the Provisional 52nd Division) revolted on the 17th under the leadership of General Zeng Zesheng and joined the Northeast People's Liberation Army. They were warmly welcomed by the People's Liberation Army and the people of the liberated areas who are currently besieging Changchun. The situation inside Changchun city is now extremely chaotic as a result. Large forces of the People's Liberation Army have now gathered in the suburbs and are about to enter the city to deal with the stubborn remnants of the New 7th Army. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek is forcing this half-starved and defeated army to break through hundreds of miles to Shenyang, otherwise they will be "punished for disobeying orders." This is clearly sending them to their deaths. Moreover, the breakout order and plan have been given to the People's Liberation Army by General Zeng Zesheng. In front of Zheng Dongguo, the commander of the Changchun garrison, and other KMT officers and soldiers, there is only one way out: to revolt like the 60th Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou Front, 18th: Fan Hanjie, the supreme commander of the Kuomintang army in Jinzhou, was captured on the 16th while attempting to escape. This bandit, the commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang's "Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region" and deputy commander-in-chief of the "Northeast Suppression Headquarters" and director of the Jinzhou Forward Command Post, disguised himself and fled after the People's Liberation Army entered Jinzhou city on the afternoon of the 14th and fighting was still ongoing. After leaving the city, he fled southeast toward the Bohai coast, but was captured by the People's Liberation Army when he fled to Gujiawopeng, more than 20 miles from Jinzhou. Fan Hanjie is a native of Dabu, Guangdong, a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy, and a member of the Sixth Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang. He served as the director of the Education Department of the Kuomintang Central Military Academy, commander of the 27th Army, and commander-in-chief of the 38th Army Group. After the Japanese surrender, he was promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense. In September of last year, he served as the supreme commander of the Kuomintang army attacking the Jiaodong liberated area. Last winter, he led the reorganized 54th Army and two brigades of the reorganized 8th Army to reinforce Jinzhou. Fan Hanjie is the third member of the KMT Central Committee to be captured; before him were Kang Ze and Wang Yaowu.

  　锦州匪首范汉杰已就擒
    【新华社长春前线十八日急电】长春守军六十军全部三个师（暂二十一师、一八二师及暂五十二师），已于十七日在军长曾泽生将军领导下起义加入东北人民解放军，受到正在包围长春的解放军和解放区人民的热烈欢迎。现长春城内情况因之极为混乱。解放军大军现已云集城郊，即将入城解决尚图顽抗之新七军。同时蒋介石则迫令这支饿得半死的残败队伍向沈阳作几百里路的突围，否则“即以违抗命令论罪”。这显然是要他们送死。同时，该项突围命令和突围计划，均已由曾泽生将军带给解放军。在长春守城司令官郑洞国及其他国民党军官兵面前已经只有一条活路，就是跟六十军一样——起义。
    【新华社锦州前线十八日电】锦州国民党军最高指挥官范匪汉杰，已于十六日在逃跑途中被捕获。这个国民党“冀热辽边区”总司令、“东北剿总”副总司令兼锦州前进指挥所主任，系十四日下午解放军攻入锦州城、战斗还在进行时，化装逃跑者。他出城后，向东南方渤海岸逃走，但当其逃至距锦州二十余里的谷家窝棚时，即为解放军捕获。范汉杰系广东大埔人，黄埔军校一期毕业，国民党六届中央监察委员。曾任国民党中央军校教育处处长，二十七军军长、三十八集团军总司令。日本投降后，升任蒋匪国防部陆军副总司令。去年九月，曾任进攻胶东解放区的国民党军最高指挥官。去年冬率整五十四军及整八军各两个旅增援锦州。范汉杰是国民党中委被俘获的第三人，在他以前的是康泽和王耀武。
