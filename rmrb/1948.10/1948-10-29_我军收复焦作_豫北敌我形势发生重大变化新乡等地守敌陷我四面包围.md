Xinhua News Agency, North China, 27th -- A unit of the People's Liberation Army on the front lines of northern Henan recovered Jiaozuo, a famous coal mining area in western section of the Daqing Road, on the 24th. The defending enemy, the 20th Regiment of the Henan Security Corps, attempted to flee to Xiuwu. The People's Liberation Army is currently encircling and annihilating them near Daiwang Town (20 li east of Jiaozuo).

Note: Jiaozuo is an important mining area in North China, second only to the Kailuan Coal Mine. It was recovered from the Japanese invaders by our army on September 6, 1945, and occupied by the Kuomintang army on October 12, 1946. The current recovery of Jiaozuo marks a major change in the enemy and our situation in the northern Henan area. At present, the enemy in northern Henan are isolated and defending only a few strongholds along the Pinghan Railway, such as Xinxiang, Ji County, Anyang, and the western section of the Daqing Road, such as Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Huojia. They are extremely embarrassed, and the large iron bridge on the Yellow River behind them has been cut off by our army. These enemy troops are surrounded by the People's Liberation Army on all sides, and the only way out for them is to revolt and surrender.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th -- Local troops of the Xifu Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region continue to actively operate in the area along the Jing River northwest of Xi'an. On October 17, this unit ambushed a portion of the Kuomintang ＠邑 County Security Regiment of more than 300 men near Zhanghong Town, northeast of ＠ County on the east bank of the Jing River. At the cost of one death and three injuries, they captured alive the pseudo-police chief of the county, Liu Jianzhang, and 45 others, killed and wounded seven enemy soldiers, and seized a batch of weapons. Another unit of our army attacked the Duli Railway Station, more than 20 li east of Sanyuan, on the night of the 19th, capturing four enemy soldiers and seizing a batch of supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Shaanxi Front, 27th -- Ye Song, director of the news office, and Zhang Zichao, instructor, of the 479th Regiment of the 160th Division of the Kuomintang 65th Army, stationed in Wangjia Tihu Village, 12 li northeast of Chengcheng, came to surrender to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the 20th with an orderly.
