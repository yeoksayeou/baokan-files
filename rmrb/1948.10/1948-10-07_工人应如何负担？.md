    To the Editor:
    The enforcement of laws regarding worker burdens varies from place to place, affecting workers' lives and work morale. For example, He Shun, Xingtai, and other counties do not include worker labor and wage income in village burdens, while Wu'an and Shexian counties include worker labor and wage income in village burdens and overestimate income, seemingly symbolizing forcing workers to return to their villages. One of our trainees, whose wage income is only enough to maintain life, is being forced to bear burdens by the village. When the factory went to explain, they were told that the factory was covering up. How should these problems be solved? Please reply.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xinhua Paper Mill　Ming Yuan
    Answer: The issue of worker burdens has been answered by the North China People's Government Finance Department as follows:
    The situation described in the letter from Xinhua Paper Mill exists in various places. To solve this problem, both sides must take responsibility. The burdens of workers in factories, whether wage income tax or war support fees, should be uniformly collected by the factory from the workers. After the workers pay taxes at the factory, the factory should issue tax receipts, and they will no longer bear burdens in the village, nor will they be counted as labor conscripts in the village. The village can only levy burdens based on the agricultural income of the worker's family. It is against regulations for some villages in Wu'an and Shexian to include worker labor and income in the assessment of burdens. If the factory is not acting in accordance with regulations, opinions should be submitted to the factory through the government, and the government should also assist the factory in collecting taxes and explain to village cadres. We should recognize that today the burden on farmers is very heavy, and their lives are not as good as those of workers. If the factory unilaterally caters to the emotions of the workers and does not allow them to bear burdens, it may cause conflicts and affect the factory's production. If some workers have low wages, only enough to maintain life and unable to bear burdens, they should apply to the local government for tax exemption. Therefore, the governments of Wu'an and Shexian counties should inspect the handling of worker burden issues, correct them, and cooperate with the factory to jointly handle worker burden issues. The factory should also take the initiative to cooperate with the local government to solve the problem.
    Regarding the issue of worker burdens, local governments and factories should handle it appropriately according to the actual situation before the North China People's Government issues a unified method, to facilitate the development of industrial and agricultural production.

### 工人应如何负担？

专栏：=询问与答覆

　　工人应如何负担？编辑同志：
    工人负担问题，各地执行法令不一致，影响工人的生活与工作情绪，如和顺邢台等县不将工人劳力与工资收入计算在村负担内，而武安、涉县则将工人劳力与工资收入计算在村负担内，而且将收入估计的过大，好象有硬逼工人回乡的象征。我们一个练习生，其工资收入，只能维持生活，而村中硬逼其负担，厂方前往解释，则说厂方包庇。这些问题应如何解决，请答复为盼。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　新华纸厂　明远
    答：工人负担问题已请华北民人政府财政部答复如下：
    新华纸厂来信所说情况，各地都有，要解决这个问题，必须两方面负责，在厂工人的负担，不论工资所得税，或战勤费，均由厂方向工人统一征收；工人在厂纳税后，由厂方发给纳税收据，就不再在村里负担，也不在村算支差劳力，村上派负担，只能根据工人家庭的农业收入部分。象武安、涉县有些村中计进工人劳力与收入，征收负担，是不合规定的。如果工厂方面没有按照规定办事，应通过政府向工厂提出意见，同时政府应该协同工厂征收，并向村干解释。我们应认识到今天农民的负担是很重的，生活也没有工人好，如果厂方片面的为了照顾工人的情绪，不让工人负担，可能引起矛盾，会影响到工厂的生产；若有的工人工资低，仅能维持生活无力负担时，应向当地政府呈请免税。为此请武安涉县两县政府，检查一下工人负担问题的处理，加以纠正，并协同厂方共同办理工人负担问题，工厂也应主动的协同当地政府解决。
    关于工人的负担问题，各地政府与工厂，在华北人民政府未颁发统一办法以前，应根据实际情况适当处理，以利发展工业和农业生产。
