　　How to Solve the Difficulty of Raw Materials for Saltpeter Production?
　　Boiling saltpeter has now become a sideline production for the masses in Taihang. In solving the problem of raw materials, various regions have made many innovations. The existing experiences are now introduced as follows:
　　I. How to expand the source of nitre soil
　　The supply of nitre soil is a rather difficult problem. When scraping nitre soil, saltpeter workers often have conflicts with the masses. The places with the most nitre soil are toilets, manure pits, old walls, broken houses, and damp places, but saltpeter workers often scrape nitre soil randomly without consulting with the masses, which damages relations with the masses. Therefore, to solve the difficulty of nitre soil source, it is first necessary to improve relations with the masses, mobilize the masses, especially women, children, and other semi-labor force, to scrape new soil themselves and sell it to the saltpeter workshops. On the one hand, it can increase the income of the masses, and on the other hand, it can reduce disputes. Secondly, the problem must be solved by improving technology and enhancing the ability to identify nitre soil. There are two ways to do this: one is to identify it by the color of the soil. Soil that is yellow and damp contains nitrate, and soil that is black and gray contains the most nitrate. The other is to identify it by the taste of the soil. Soil that tastes astringent and cool is saltpeter, bitter is brine, and salty is salt. Three feet from the ground in toilets and one and a half feet from the ground on general walls also contain nitrate. There is more underground in spring and summer, and more on the walls in autumn and winter. The second is to artificially create nitre soil. For example, Lucheng created a method of planting and cultivating soil. The method of planting soil is to smear wheat bran and mud on damp, smelly bricks to prevent the odor from escaping. After ten days, the soil turns black and becomes nitre soil. This kind of nitre soil has less salt content and saves coal when boiling. When smearing in winter, add half a bucket of brine to ten loads of soil in the water to prevent freezing. The method of cultivating soil is to sprinkle a layer of brine on soil with very little nitrate and then add a layer of soil. After twenty days, it becomes nitre soil.
　　II. How to solve the difficulty of ash
　　In the past, the supply of ash was determined by administrative power, assigning a certain village to supply a certain amount. Some cadres and saltpeter workers developed a kind of privileged thinking from this, believing that it was a support-the-front task for the masses to supply ash soil, and lacked mobilization and persuasion work. The masses considered it a burden and were not interested, did not pay attention to preserving ash and firewood, and did not pay attention to ash baking technology. Solving this problem must also start from two aspects. On the one hand, research substitutes. For example, Heshun created the method of first boiling ashes that cannot be directly used to boil saltpeter (only wood ash can be directly boiled) into black alkali. The method is to first put the ash in a basket, pour hot water on it, and boil it into a thick soup, which becomes alkali blocks after cooling. Then use eleven loads of nitre soil and five loads of grass ash, mix the grass ash and nitre soil together and put them into the leaching pool. Use four catties of black alkali, first dissolve the alkali with brine and warm water and boil it into hot water, and pour it into the leaching pool. The boiling method is the same as general saltpeter boiling, and each pot can produce 20 catties of saltpeter. On the other hand, mobilize the masses to send ash and give the masses appropriate compensation.

　　怎样解决制硝原料困难？
    熬硝现已成为太行群众的副业生产，在解决原料问题上，各地已有许多创造，兹就现有经验介绍如下：
    一、怎样扩大硝土的来源
    硝土的供给是个相当困难的问题，刮硝土时，硝工常和群众发生矛盾。硝土最多的地方，是厕所粪池旧墙破房及潮湿的地方，但硝工刮硝土往往不和群众说通就乱刮，和群众关系闹的不大好，因此解决硝土来源的困难，首先必须与群众关系搞好，发动群众特别是妇女儿童等半劳力自己刮新土，送到硝房出卖，一方面可增加群众收入，一方面可减少纠纷。其次即要从提高技术上解决问题，提高识别硝土的能力，这有两种办法，一种是从土色上识别。土发黄色潮气大的即含有硝质，土发黑灰色的含硝质最多。另一种是从土的味道上识别，土味发涩发凉就是硝，苦的是卤，咸的是盐。厕所墙离地三尺，一般墙离地尺半的地方，也有硝质。春夏两季地下多，秋冬两季墙上多。其次是人为地制造硝土。如潞城创造了种土养土法。种土的做法是在发潮有臭味的砖上用麦糠和泥土抹上去，使之不透臭气，十天后土色发黑即成硝地。这种硝土盐质少，熬时省煤炭。冬天抹时，水中要渗卤水半桶和土十担，即不易冻。养土办法是把含硝质很少的土，每洒一层卤水就上一层土，二十天后即成硝土。
    二、怎样解决灰的困难
    过去用灰是经过行政力量派定某村供给多少，有些干部和硝工由此产生一种特权思想，认为群众供给灰土是支前任务，缺乏动员说服工作。群众认为是负担不感兴趣，不注意保存灰及柴草，也不注意烘灰技术。解决这个问题也须从两方面着手。一方面研究代用品，如和顺创造了将不能直接熬硝的灰（直接能熬者只有柴草灰）先熬成黑碱。办法是先把灰装在篓内，用快开的水灌上淋下，熬成稠汤，冷后就成碱块。再用硝土十一担，用草灰五担，将草灰和硝土掺起来装到淋池内，用黑碱四斤，先用卤水和温水将碱化开熬成快开的水灌入淋池内。熬法和一般熬硝一样，每锅可产硝二十斤。另一方面发动群众送灰，给群众以适当的代价。
