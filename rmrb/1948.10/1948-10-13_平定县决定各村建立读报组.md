　　【Taihang News】The Propaganda and Education Department of Pingding County discovered that some villages would simply post the newspapers on the wall and leave them unattended, while others would only have one or two people glance at the headlines before putting them away, with the masses not seeing the newspapers at all. In order to implement the newspapers among the masses, the county stipulated: 1. Each district should have the secretary of the district government and the secretary of the sub-committee as the core to specifically lead the newspaper reading work. 2. Each village should establish a newspaper reading group (three to five people) to ensure that the important news in the newspapers and the news related to the village are promptly known to the villagers. (Newspaper reading group members can be of any background, as long as they are enthusiastic about their work.)

　　平定县决定各村建立读报组
    【太行讯】平定县宣传教育部门，发现有的村将报贴在墙上就不管了，有的只是一二人看一看大标题，就放起来了，群众根本看不见报纸。为了把报纸贯彻到群众中，该县规定：一、各区以区公所秘书和分委秘书为核心专门领导读报工作。二、各村建立读报组，（三人五人）把报上的重要消息，与本村有关的消息，使本村群众及时知道。（读报组员不论什么成份，热心工作即可。）
