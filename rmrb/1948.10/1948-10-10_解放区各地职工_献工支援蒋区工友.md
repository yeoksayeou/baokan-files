　　Workers in Liberated Areas Donate Labor to Support Workers in KMT-Controlled Areas
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th—The Sixth National Labor Congress's call to "donate one day of voluntary work to support the labor movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas" has been met with enthusiastic response. Workers at a factory under the Industrial Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Joint Defense Region and a public factory in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, upon hearing about the persecution suffered by their class brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, worked an extra day on the second Sunday of September, donating their wages from that day to a fund to support them. Many workers in the two factories also donated a month's, half a month's, or two days' wages. For the same purpose, 146 workers in the engineering section of a certain railway bureau in North China voluntarily worked overtime before the Mid-Autumn Festival. The workers in this section donated more than 220,000 Jichaos, equivalent to more than 700 kilograms of millet at the then-current market price. Workers at a factory in Shijiazhuang, in addition to contributing the equivalent of fifty-three workdays in overtime wages around the Mid-Autumn Festival, donated 48,000 yuan.

　　解放区各地职工
    献工支援蒋区工友
    【新华社陕北八日电】第六次全国劳动大会关于“作义务工一天。支援国民党统治区职工运动”的号召，已经获得热烈响应。陕甘宁晋绥联防军区工业部的某工厂及晋绥解放区的某公营工厂的职工，在听到国民党统治区的阶级兄弟们所受的迫害后，均于九月的第二个星期日加工一天，将该日工资捐助为支援他们的基金。两厂中还有许多工人加捐一个月，半个月或两日的工资。为着同样的目的，华北某路局工务段职工一百四十六人，在中秋节前夕，自报加班。该段职工献金达冀钞二十二万余元，按当时市价合小米七百余斤。石家庄某厂职工，在中秋节前后除加班献工资共合五十三个工外，捐款四万八千元。
