(Taihang News) The Xingtai County Committee Comrade Wu Xingren went deep into the mutual aid teams, helped the masses to calculate accounts in detail, and expanded wheat fields and increased fertilizer. On the evening of September 21st, Wu Xingren participated in the meeting of mutual aid team leaders and cadres in Yingtou Village, 7th District, to study the current work in Yingtou Village. According to the team leaders' reports, the autumn harvest has ended, and they are plowing the land to prepare for wheat planting. During the discussion, everyone said that the autumn harvest was not good this year, and most of our wheat fields are dry land, and it hasn't rained. There are only 223 mu of paddy fields, including 70 mu of vegetable fields. Should we plant wheat or not...? There are not many seeds. Wu Xingren said, "How do you think we should handle this?" Zhang Xinshan said, "We have to be frugal and specifically calculate our food consumption. My family of five harvested three dan of grain and one dan of mixed grain. This autumn's public grain and labor prices require 140 jin of rice. If my family of five eats four jin of grain per day, we can make it to the end of October. If we don't calculate carefully, we'll eat four or five sheng of grain every day." Hao Yingchen said, "Transportation is a big issue, we can only compensate with manual labor, there's no other way." An Jilu said, "We must protect the vegetables." At this time, Wu Xingren asked everyone to calculate an account: if we strive to plant wheat on all 70 mu of paddy vegetable fields, without leaving any spring hemp land (hemp land is good paddy land), each mu of wheat can yield eight dou (after planting wheat, we can still plant wheat stubble hemp), and by applying more fertilizer, we will not harvest less. In this way, we can harvest an extra season of wheat. Generally, compared to spring hemp, wheat stubble hemp yields ten hemp and twenty jin of fiber less, selling for 40,000 yuan; but how much can eight dou of wheat sell for? Let's calculate which is more worthwhile?" After everyone's discussion, they felt that planting wheat was more profitable and decided to plant wheat on all 70 mu of vegetable fields at once. This can increase production by more than 50 shi. In addition, according to the opinions of the masses, it was proposed to convert more than 20 mu of long-term dry land in Yangpi Gully into two-level manual irrigation paddy fields, and more than 10 mu of long-term dry land in the west of the village can be repaired into splashed irrigation fields. In this way, Yingtou can increase its wheat paddy fields by more than 100 mu. Wu Xingren then led everyone to study ways to supplement fertilizer, striving to make this year's fertilizer match last year's. He also proposed to speed up the work so as to free up time for transportation, which everyone agreed to.

　　On September 25th, taking advantage of the rainy weather and idle labor time, a mass meeting was held to mobilize organized and planned wheat planting. Everyone unanimously agreed to strive to plant wheat on all the paddy and dry land in the village that could be planted with wheat. It was also proposed not to leave a single stubble in the autumn plowing.

　　邢台县委深入互助组
    具体算帐推动种麦
    【太行讯】邢台县委武兴仁同志深入互助组，帮助群众具体算帐，扩大麦田增加肥料。九月廿一号晚，武兴仁参加了七区营头村互助组长干部会议，研究营头村当前工作。据组长汇报，秋收已结束，正在犁地，准备种麦。大家讨论中，一致说，今年秋景不好，咱这里种麦旱地又是一大部份，天又不下雨，只有二二三亩水地，里面还有七十亩菜地。种麦不种麦吧………？没啥种头。武兴仁说：“大家讨论该怎样办？”张心善说：“得节约，具体算帐吃饭，我家五口人，收谷三石，杂田一石，今年秋季公粮牛工价得一百四十斤米，每天我五口人按四斤粮吃，可到十月底。若不算帐，哪天也得四、五升粮吃。”郝应辰说：“搞运输是个大事，只有担脚来补吧，别有啥法。”安继路说：“要保住菜”。这时武兴仁让大家算一个帐：如果把七十亩水地菜争取完全种上麦子，不留春麻地，每亩麦子能收八斗（种麻地是好水地），打了麦子还能种麦茬麻，多上些肥料，一点不少收。这样能多收一季麦子。一般麦茬麻与春麻比较，少收十个麻、廿斤批子，卖四万元；但八斗麦子能卖多少钱？大家算算帐那个上算？”经大家讨论，都感觉种麦利大，都要把七十亩菜地一下种上麦子。这样可增产五十多石。另外根据群众意见，号召把羊皮沟的二十多亩多年旱地改作两道手水地，村西十余亩多年旱地可修成泼水地。这样，营头可增为水地麦田一百余亩。武兴仁接着领导大家研究补肥办法，要争取今年肥料赶上去年。并提出要往前赶活，誊出时间搞运输，大家都同意。
    九月二十五日趁雨天劳力空闲时间，召开了群众会议，动员有组织有计划的种麦，大家一致要争取把全村能种麦的水旱地都种上麦子。对于秋翻地也提出不留一根茬。
