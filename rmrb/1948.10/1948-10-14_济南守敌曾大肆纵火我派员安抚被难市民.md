Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th. During the battle to liberate Jinan, the defending enemy, under the personal order and command of Wang Yaowu, carried out a devastating destruction of the city. Around the city walls, from the afternoon of September 22nd, large fires burned until the 24th. Citizens' homes, furniture, and property in the disaster area were all destroyed. Flour companies like Fengnian and Chengji were burned to ruins. In the Xiguan Shunhe Street and Waiqinghe areas, the flames had not yet been extinguished when the People's Liberation Army arrived. The defending enemy set up machine guns to threaten more than 50 shops in Qisheng Street, Hedongtai, and Jiaolou Street, ordering them to move out completely within an hour. Before the merchants could move out, the Chiang bandits used explosives to collapse the houses. More than 50 merchants mostly escaped with only their lives, and all their property was destroyed. Young and middle-aged people who did not escape in time were captured by the enemy. In the Jiaolou Street and Zhao Jiazhuangzhai areas, more than 300 households were burned, leaving only a few broken houses. Most of the residents in the above areas were families of railway and factory workers who lived in poverty. This looting left them displaced. On the second day after the liberation of Jinan, the People's Liberation Army sent personnel to comfort and慰问 the distressed citizens and provide appropriate resettlement and relief.

　　济南守敌曾大肆纵火我派员安抚被难市民
    【新华社济南十二日电】解放济南之战中，守敌在王耀武亲自通令指挥下，曾在市区施行了一次毁灭性的大破坏。城垣周围，自九月廿二日下午起，大火燃烧至二十四日，灾区市民住房、家具、资财，都被烧毁；丰年、成记等面粉公司烧成一片废墟。西关顺河街、外清河一带，直至解放军到达时，火焰尚未熄。守敌曾架起机枪威胁启盛街、河东台、角楼街等五十多家商店，限令于一小时内全部搬走，当商民尚未搬出时，蒋匪即以炸药将房舍炸塌。五十余家商民多仅只身逃出，资财全部被毁。未及逃脱的青壮年，均被敌抓走。角楼街及赵家庄宅一带三百余户民房烧得只剩下了几间破屋。上述各区居民，大部是铁路及工厂家属，生活贫困，遭此洗劫，流离失所。济南市解放后第二日，解放军即派员对被难市民，进行安抚慰问，并予以适当安置救济。
