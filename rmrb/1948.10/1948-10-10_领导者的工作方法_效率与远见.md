Xinhua News Agency editor's note: This short essay incisively illustrates two major issues in leadership work. We hope that all comrades engaged in leadership positions will study it carefully and use it to help overcome inefficiency and the errors of bureaucratism.

	Bolshevik efficiency is a necessary and essential quality for a political leader's party workers; it is unimaginable without this quality.

	Efficiency should be understood as: the ability to practically implement the Party's decisions and promptly adopt methods to realize the Party's line. An efficient organizer should have the ability to indicate the direction in a given situation, solve problems correctly and without delay, and take necessary steps in a timely manner to execute national plans, tasks, and directives. This is achieved through the experience, knowledge, and political sensitivity of the staff.

	Lenin once said that the Party's organization and Party leaders "must cultivate the necessary knowledge, necessary experience, and, in addition to knowledge and experience, the necessary political sensitivity in order to solve complex political problems quickly and correctly." It goes without saying that solving problems efficiently, quickly, and without delay has nothing in common with impatience and rashness. Such impatience often leads to abandoning decisive, key issues, replacing them with secondary, accidental issues, and substituting serious organizational work with empty routines. Comrade Stalin taught our cadres to be "wise and not impatient when solving complex problems, comprehensively judging the direction, and comprehensively estimating all strengths and weaknesses."

	Bolshevik efficiency is talent. At the 17th Party Congress, Comrade Stalin clearly portrayed the chatterbox-style worker, the person who treats the Soviet regime honestly and loyally but lacks the ability to lead or organize anything. Comrade Stalin said of these chatterboxes: "They mobilize, raise issues sharply, they have changes, they have progress, but things remain as they were." Comrade Stalin at that time demanded that incurable chatterboxes who could drown any living thing in endless speeches be removed from leadership positions. Comrade Stalin said: "There is no place for chatterboxes in efficient work."

	We also have another type of unreliable leader in efficient work, the leader who dares not solve any problems. He likes to delay things in the guise of fighting impatience and likes to hold meetings in the guise of collective leadership. To avoid solving problems, he always pretends to "think about it" and "discuss it," but afterwards, he neither thinks nor discusses it with others. There are such situations in the actual work of the state party committee. To correct the discovered shortcomings, effective measures must be taken, but the problem is pushed to the Party committee meeting, and there is no preparation for considering the problem. This kind of "leadership" usually causes delays, slowness, and sometimes even defects.

	Efficiency in work requires definite plans, proper allocation of manpower, inspection of implementation, and close contact with those being led. If there is no proper plan that can estimate the main force and reserves, no mutual coordination is established between the various armed forces, no precise deadlines are set, no responsible persons are appointed, and there is no thorough and continuous inspection of execution, then it is inconceivable to conduct military operations successfully. Similarly, without planning and inspection, any achievements in economic activity and economic work are unimaginable. In cases where the situation changes during war, if the command is not flexible enough and the plan is not properly revised, the troops will suffer defeat. The situation in economic work is also the same. Here, the same flexibility, creativity, and genuine efficiency are required.

	It goes without saying that efficiency is required not only in economic leadership but also in Party work. All workers in Party organizations should be efficient, agile, and proactive. Problems facing Party committees must be resolved without delay or stagnation. Timely acceptance of opinions, rapid absorption of suggestions from Communist Party members, ability to guide their activities, and timely correction of staff – all of this is the obligation of a political leader.

	The All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee advocates efficient working methods. What are efficient methods? That is: solve problems in a timely manner. Do not waste time on unnecessary meetings. Implement serious organizational work for the execution of decisions that have been passed. Assign staff responsible for executing specific assignments and tasks. Rely on those who truly understand the exact situation to study the problem. Timely expose and correct shortcomings in the work of the Party and Soviet organizations. Conduct daily inspections of the implementation of Party and government decisions and directives. High efficiency is required of Party workers when conducting agricultural movements. Spring sowing, grain harvesting, grain supply, and autumn sowing all have seasonal characteristics. Here, a lack of efficiency and delays can ruin the whole thing. Party leaders are required not only to make good plans for carrying out work but also to indicate the direction in the situation, make quick decisions in the process of movement and plan execution, be familiar with local peculiarities, see existing difficulties, and take measures to overcome them.

	Now, local Party leaders are burying themselves in completing the spring sowing work. Here, there are many urgent, completely necessary, and non-delayable matters, large and small. The fastest completion of sowing depends on efficiency, timely adoption of practical methods, daily and constant inspection of implementation, and immediate response to discovered shortcomings. Here, Party workers should spare no time or energy.

	At the same time, precisely now, and not later, should the preparation work for harvesting be launched most intensively. Just as in winter, one should care about spring sowing – repairing tractors, selecting varieties, etc. – simultaneously with sowing, one should prepare for harvesting – repairing combine harvesters, farm tools, dryers, warehouses, etc.

	But it would be wrong to think that leading agriculture can be limited to one movement after another, limited to sowing and harvesting. Party workers should see further, deeply penetrate the laws of economics, and be familiar with the economic situation of collective farms. Analyze materials, not limited to average figures, but also summarize their organic components. Be able to compare today's summary with last year's and many years' summaries. In this way, the driving force and trends of development can be seen, and strengths and weaknesses can be seen. Party leaders can intervene and correct things in a timely manner and limit backwardness.

	For some Party and economic workers, we say that they are efficient people, "experts in eliminating defects." Of course, eliminating defects is a great art. It is an even greater art to be able to have no defects and prevent them in a timely manner.

	Bolshevik leadership not only requires timely preparation for current movements but also the ability to see further. One should remember Comrade Stalin's words: "When at the helm, one must see. If one cannot see anything and waits until the situation causes us harm, then this is not leadership. Bolshevism does not understand leadership in this way; to lead, one must have foresight."

	Our cadres are busy with the huge, current, and efficient work of completing the economic plans of urban and rural areas. This work has special political significance, and only those who are detached from life will despise it. However, at the same time, if one is completely buried in the so-called "current work" and ignores the work that has been done and does not consider the future of the work, then this is an incorrigible sin. Life does not advance according to a single standard, it changes with each passing day, situations are changing, and new problems are arising. Party workers who are sensitive to fresh things should draw appropriate conclusions from this.

	Often, our staff members are caught up in daily, current affairs to such an extent that they lose the possibility of thinking about the future, lose the thread, and live from day to day. In a letter on establishing the work of the Soviet leadership organs, Lenin wrote: One must "free oneself from the chaos that will bury us all, to ensure oneself the possibility of calmly and comprehensively thinking about the work." How important it is that our Party and economic workers remember these words of Lenin.

	Those who are completely busy with current work unexpectedly face serious shortcomings precisely because they do not comprehensively think about the work. Such workers are often satisfied with partial achievements, one day's achievements, and the achievements of one movement, and disregard the backwardness that is brewing in the whole aspect.

	For example, this is the situation of some Party workers in some states in Ukraine. They lead agriculture for the sake of movement, superficially, without economic analysis, and without paying attention to economic development trends. In general, agricultural movements are not badly carried out, as if the plan has been completed. However, in Ukraine, the sowing of important crops such as spring wheat has been shrinking year by year. For example, in the Poltava Oblast, spring wheat sowing was 135,000 hectares in 1937, 108,500 hectares in 1938, 99,000 hectares in 1939, and 91,000 hectares in 1940. After the war, in 1946, spring wheat sowing lagged far behind 1937 to 1939. The Party leaders of the Poltava Oblast did not analyze the agricultural economy and did not discover the harmful tendency of shrinking spring wheat sowing in a timely manner. Other Ukrainian workers also made the same mistake. Comrade Stalin, the February Enlarged Meeting of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee, has pointed this out.

	The art of foresight is also a valuable quality for Party workers in the industrial field. Some Party and economic leaders in industry do not look to tomorrow, do not care about tomorrow, are satisfied with what they have gained, and therefore lose the ability to critically assess economic achievements, although these achievements are sometimes not solid. For example, this is the view of some workers in the coal mining industry. Everyone knows that the success of coal mining is determined by the timely preparation work. Sometimes there are cases where coal mines complete the plan well for several months, or even a year, and then "unexpectedly" disrupt the plan and start the decline in mining volume. During the inspection, it was discovered that when conducting coal mining, economic leaders and Party organizations did not care about the preparation work and did not look at the future of the coal mine.

	This refers not only to individual coal mines but also to entire coal mining areas. Take Kuzbass as an example, where coal mining used to grow rapidly, but recently the growth rate has dropped sharply. What happened? Kuzbass is an up-and-coming area that mines coal in the upper layers. For this purpose, appropriate mining methods were stipulated. However, the situation has changed, and the upper layers can no longer supply us with the amount of coal we require, and we need to turn to the lower, deeper layers. For this purpose, the previous old mining methods often cannot be reused and need to be supplemented with new methods suitable for the new conditions of the coal mine. However, the Party organizations and economic leaders of Kuzbass did not consider, study, and experiment with this method in advance and now have to carry out this work in a hurry. Although local organizations may now be able to demonstrate due efficiency, the losses suffered due to a lack of foresight are obvious.

	The struggle to complete the current plan should be combined with solving future problems and preventing defects, imbalances, and backwardness. If the Party leader does not look forward, then the efficiency of leadership loses its value.

### 领导者的工作方法——效率与远见

　　领导者的工作方法
    ——效率与远见
    新华社编者按：这节短文很中肯地说明了领导工作的两个主要问题，希望一切做领导工作的同志们加以精读，并用来帮助克服无效率状态和事务主义的错误。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    布尔塞维克的效率，乃是一个政治领导者的党的工作人员所必要与应有的品质，没有这种品质是不可想象的。
    效率应理解为：在实际上能够实施党的决定，及时采取实现党的路线的办法。一个讲究效率的组织者，应有在一定情况中指示方针的能力，应正确和不耽搁地解决问题；及时采取必要的步骤来执行国家的计划、任务、指令。这是以工作人员的经验、知识与政治敏感来达成的。
    列宁曾经说过：党的组织与党的领导者，“为了迅速与正确地解决复杂的政治问题，就要培养必需的知识，必需的经验，以及除了知识和经验以外的必要的政治敏感”。不言而喻，有效率地、迅速地、不耽搁地解决问题，与急躁和草率没有任何共同之点。这种急躁，常常引导到放弃有决定意义的、关键的问题，代替以次要的、偶然发生的问题，把严肃的组织工作代替以空洞的例行公事。斯大林同志教导我们的干部，要他们“在解决复杂问题的时候，在全面的判定方向和全面的估计一切长短的时候，应当明智和不急躁”。
    布尔塞维克的效率就是才干。斯大林同志在党的十七次代表大会上清楚地替清谈家式的工作者，替老实与忠诚地对待苏维埃政权、但没有能力领导、没有能力组织什么的人，画了一个像。斯大林同志论这些清谈家说：“他们动员起来了，把问题尖锐地提出来了，他们有转变，有进步，然而事情原封不动。”斯大林同志当时要求把那些可以让任何活生生的事情沉溺在滔滔不绝的演说里的不可救药的清谈家，从领导位置上撤销。斯大林同志说过：“在讲效率的工作中，没有清谈家的位置。”
    我们也有在讲效率的工作中之另一种类型的不可靠的领导者，这就是不敢解决任何问题的领导者。他喜欢在与急躁作斗争的形式底下来拖延事情，喜欢在集体领导的形式底下开会。为了避免解决问题，他总是装着“想一想”、“商量商量”的样子，然而过后他自己既不想也不同别人商量。在州党委的实际工作中有这样的情形。为了纠正已发现的缺点，要采取有效的办法，但是把问题推给党委会议，并且也没有准备考虑问题，这种“领导”通常引起迟延、缓慢，有时还引起缺陷。
    工作中的效率，要求确定的计划，人力的正当分配，对执行情形的检查，同被领导者的密切联系。如果没有制订能够估计到主力军与后备军的适当计划，没有建立各种武装之间的互相配合，没有确定精确的期限，没有委任负责人，没有对执行的周密与不断的检查，那么，有成就地进行军事行动是不可设想的。同样的，如果没有计划，没有检查，任何经济活动和经济工作中的成就都是不可想象的。在战争中情况变化的场合，如果指挥上不够灵活，对计划不加以适当的修正，那么部队会遭受失败。在经济工作中的情形，也是这样。这里也要求同样的灵活性、创造性和真正的效率。
    不言而喻，不仅在经济领导的问题上，而且在党内工作中，也要求效率。党的机构的一切工作者，应赋有效率、敏捷、能动性。必须不拖延、不停滞地解决发生在党委面前的问题。及时接受意见，迅速吸收共产党员的建议，善于指导他们的活动，及时纠正工作人员——这一切是政治领导者应尽的义务。
    联共党（布）中央委员会提倡讲效率的工作方法。什么是讲效率的方法？这就是：及时解决问题。不花费时间在不必要的会议上。对通过了的决定之执行，施行严肃的的组织工作。分配负责执行具体的委托和任务的工作人员。依靠真正了解确切情况者来研究问题。及时揭露与纠正党与苏维埃组织中工作的缺点。对党与政府的决定与指令的执行，进行日常的检查。在进行农业运动时，对党的工作者要求高度的效率。春季播种，谷物收割，谷物供应，秋季播种，这一切工作都带着季节性质。在这里如果缺乏效率、迟延，可以破坏全部事情。对党的领导者，不仅要求为实行工作而订出好计划，而且还要在情况中指示方针，在运动和执行计划的过程中作迅速的决定，熟悉当地特殊性，看到现存的困难，并采取办法克服困难。
    现在地方党的领导者，正埋头于完成春季的播种工作。这里有许多迫切的、完全必要的、不可耽搁的大小事情。播种之最迅速的完成，依靠于效率、实际办法之及时采用、执行情形之日常与时刻检查，对发现的缺点之立刻反应。这里党的工作者要不惜时间和精力。
    同时，正是现在而不是再晚些，应当最紧张地展开收割的准备工作。正如在冬天，就应当关心春季播种——修理拖拉机、选择品种等等，与进行播种同时，就应当准备收割——修理联合收割机、农具、干燥器、仓库等等。
    但是如果认为领导农业可以仅限于一个又一个的运动，仅限于播种和收割，那就错了。党的工作者应该看得更远，深刻地看透经济的规律，要熟悉集体农场的经济状况。分析材料，不要限于平均数字，而且要归纳其有机的组成部分。要会把今天的总结与去年的、许多年的总结来比较。这样就可以看出发展的动力和趋势，就可以看出长短。党的领导者可以及时干预、纠正事情，限制落后。
    对于有些党的与经济的工作者，我们说他们是讲效率的人，是“消除缺陷的专家”。当然，排除缺陷是很大的艺术。可以做到没有缺陷，及时预防缺陷，那是更大的艺术。
    布尔塞维克的领导不仅要求及时准备当前的运动，而且善于看得更远。应记得斯大林同志的话：“掌舵时要看。如果什么也看不见，等到情况使我们遭了殃，那么这并不是领导。布尔塞维克主义不是这样了解领导的，要领导，就应有远见。”
    我们的干部忙碌于完成城乡经济计划的庞大的、当前的、有效率的工作。这个工作具有特殊的政治意义，只有脱离生活的人们才会蔑视它。然而同时如果完全埋头于所谓“当前的工作”中，不理会作过的工作，不考虑工作的前途，那么这是不可救药的罪恶。生活不是按照一个标准前进的，日新月异，情况变化着，新的问题发生着，对新鲜事物具有敏感的党的工作者，应从此中作出适当的结论。
    时常我们的工作人员陷于日常的当前的事务中，陷到这样程度，就是自己失掉了思考前途的可能性，失掉了线索，做一天和尚撞一天钟。列宁论建立苏维埃领导机关的工作的一封信上曾写道：必须“使自己摆脱杂乱无章，这种杂乱无章会葬送我们大家，要保证自己安静地全面思考工作的可能性”。我们党与经济工作者要记住列宁的这些话，这多么重要。
    完全忙碌于当前工作的人，正是因为没有从全面去思考工作，而意外地面临着严重的缺陷。这种工作者时常满足于局部的成绩，一天的成绩，一个运动的成绩，而无视于在整个方面正在酝酿的落后。
    例如，乌克兰一些州的一些党的工作者的情况，就是如此。他们为运动而运动地、表面地、不分析经济地、不注意经济发展趋势地领导农业。一般说来，农业运动进行得并不坏，仿佛是完成了计划。然而在乌克兰象春麦这样重要的农作物的播种，一年一年减缩了。例如在波尔塔瓦州，春麦播种一九三七年为十三万五千公顷，一九三八年为十万八千五百公顷，一九三九年为九万九千公顷，一九四○年为九万一千公顷。在战后，一九四六年春麦播种大大落后于一九三七到一九三九年。波尔塔瓦州党的领导者没有分析农业经济，没有及时发现减缩春麦播种的有害倾向。其他的乌克兰的工作者也犯了同样的错误。斯大林同志，联共党（布）中央委员会二月扩大会议，已指出了这一点。
    远见的艺术，也是工业领域中党的工作者宝贵的品质。一些工业中党的与经济的领导者不去看明天，不关心明天，满足于已得的，因而失掉批判地估计经济成就的能力，虽然这些成就有时是不巩固的。例如，有些煤矿工业的工作者的观点就是如此。大家知道，采煤的成就是由于准备工作的及时进行来决定的。有时有这样的情形，煤矿在几个月期间，甚至一年之内，很好完成计划，然后“意外地”破坏了计划，而开始采量的下降。检查时发现了，当进行煤的开采时，经济领导者与党的组织不关心准备工作的进行，不看一看煤矿的明天。
    这不仅指个别的煤矿，而且同样指整个煤矿区。拿库兹巴斯为例吧，这里煤的开采曾经迅速增长，而在最近速度的增长猛降了。发生了什么事情呢？库兹巴斯是后起的区域，是在上面的矿层采煤的。为了这个目的，规定了采矿的适当方法。然而情况变了，上面的矿层已不能供给我们所要求的煤的数量，需要转向下面的、更深的矿层去。为了这个目的，先前的旧采矿方法往往不能复用，需要以适合于煤矿的新条件的新方法来补充它。然而库兹巴斯党的组织与经济领导者没有预先考虑、研究和实验这种方法，现在不得不匆匆忙忙进行这个工作。虽然现在地方组织有可能表现出应有的效率，但由于缺乏远见而受的损失是很明显的。
    为完成当前计划的斗争，应与解决前途问题，与预防缺陷、不均、落后配合起来。如果党的领导者不向前看，那么领导的效率便失掉价值。
