Brief News
    The signatory countries of the Brussels Military Alliance Treaty, namely Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, held a two-day "routine meeting" in Paris on September 27, with representatives from the United States and Canada attending as "observers," to discuss issues such as U.S. military aid and the establishment of a joint defense organization. American imperialism is using the plan to provide military aid to Western Europe, which will be submitted to Congress next January, as bait, telling its little partners that U.S. military aid to the five countries will depend on whether the five countries "consider the security and interests of the United States" and "what contributions they can make in supporting America's defense efforts" (Associated Press). However, the Americans themselves also expressed doubts about whether the United States actually has the ability to provide military aid to Western Europe.

    布鲁塞尔军事联盟条约的签字国英、法、荷、比、卢，在美加两国代表出席“观察”下，于九月二十七日在巴黎举行两日“例会”，讨论美国军事援助及成立联防组织等问题。美帝国主义以军事援助西欧计划将于明年一月提交国会为钓饵，对它的小伙计们说：美国对五国的军事援助要看五国“是否为美国的安全及利益着想”及“在支持美国防御努力上能作何贡献而定”（合众社）。但美国实际上是否有军事援助西欧的能力，美国人自己也表示怀疑。
