Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 13th—What is "military democracy" in combat? The answer from a unit of the East China Field Army in discussing this question was: General democracy is not allowed in combat. It is not allowed for everyone to hold meetings and discussions during combat, nor is it allowed to discuss whether or not to execute orders from superiors. However, it is necessary for commanders to humbly listen to correct opinions from subordinates on how to execute orders when the situation permits. During the discussion, platoon leader Shen Zhaoxiong and others cited the following examples: First, during a certain blocking battle when building fortifications, the company and battalion commanders originally wanted to build the heavy machine gun positions outside the enclosure, but later accepted the suggestion of a squad leader to rebuild them in the thick earthen part of the enclosure, resulting in no casualties for an entire day and night of fighting. Second, during a certain counterattack, the enemy stubbornly resisted inside the enclosure, and the gate could not be opened. Our army circled around outside for a long time without a solution, but a soldier came up with a way to break in at once. This shows that there are many correct opinions from below. The soldiers all hope for victory and will not act recklessly even in combat.

　　华东野战军某部讨论
    什么是作战中的军事民主？
    【新华社华东前线十三日电】什么是作战中的“军事民主”？华东野战军某部讨论这一问题时的答案是：作战中不允许讲一般的民主，不允许大家在作战中开会讨论，不允许对于上级的命令讨论执行不执行，但是指挥员在情形许可时虚心听取下级关于如何执行命令的正确意见，则是必要的。讨论中某部排长沈兆熊等举出下述例子：一、某次阻击战中构筑工事时，营连长本要重机枪阵地筑在围子外，后来接受班长意见改筑在围子的土厚部分，结果打了一天一夜无一伤亡；二、某次反击战中，敌人在围子内顽抗，门打不开，我军在外面转了好久无办法，结果一个战士想了个办法，一下就打进去了。这说明下面有很多正确的意见。战士们都是希望胜利的，即使在作战中也不会乱来。
