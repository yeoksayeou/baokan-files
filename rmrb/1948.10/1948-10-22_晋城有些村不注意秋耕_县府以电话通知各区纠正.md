　　Some Villages in Jincheng Neglect Autumn Plowing
  　County Government Notifies Districts by Phone to Rectify
    [Taiyue Electric] Jincheng County is about to complete the autumn harvest and has shifted to autumn plowing. In the seventh district, Shangxialiuchuan and Xigou villages have begun planned land cultivation after harvesting grain and beans. According to statistics from six key villages in Tuhe, fifth district, 450 mu of land have been cultivated, with Xiaping village alone cultivating 110 mu. In the fourth district, Fotangjie, Dongrenling, Hexi and other villages have also cultivated more than 300 mu of land. However, it has also been discovered that some villages are neglecting autumn plowing. For example, cadres in Weiding and other villages in the third district are setting aside autumn plowing to focus solely on levies and assessments, and land measurement has not been completed even after five days. Such villages exist in every district. After discovering these problems, the county government immediately notified each district by phone on the 9th to rectify them and issued an important notice on the 10th, emphasizing overcoming this tendency and strengthening leadership in autumn plowing, otherwise the autumn plowing plan would be difficult to complete. The second district immediately notified all villages, determining that the branch secretary and the Farmers' Association standing committee member should be responsible for leading land cultivation, while other levy and assessment work could continue.

　　晋城有些村不注意秋耕
  　县府以电话通知各区纠正
    【太岳电】晋城全县收秋即将完成，已转向秋耕。七区上下犁川、西沟三个村，收完谷、豆，开始有计划的进行耕地。据五区土河基点六个村的统计，已耕地四百五十亩，下坪村一村即耕了一百一十亩。四区佛堂街、洞人岭、河西等村，也已耕地三百多亩。但另一方面也发现了有些村子忽视了秋耕工作，如三区苇町等村干部，撇开秋耕光搞负担。丈地丈了五天还没丈完。此类村子各区都有。县府发现这些问题后，九日即用电话告知各区立即纠正，十日又发出重要通知，强调克服此种偏向，加强秋耕领导，否则秋耕计划难以完成。二区即通知各村，并确定支部书记农会常委负责领导耕地，其他仍可进行负担工作。
