    The People's Liberation Army launched an offensive against Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, on September 16th. By the 24th, in just eight days, the heavily fortified and heavily guarded city of Jinan was liberated, annihilating more than 100,000 enemy troops and winning over General Wu Huawen to lead his troops in an uprising. This great victory not only stunned the Kuomintang reactionaries and their American masters, but even the people of the whole country were amazed by its unexpected speed.
    The great significance of the liberation of Jinan for the overall situation is obvious. For more than a year after Chiang Kai-shek launched the all-out civil war, he always regarded the East China battlefield as his military focus, and he once used more than eighty reorganized brigades of troops in this direction, vainly attempting to determine the outcome of the war here. When the main force of the East China People's Liberation Army brilliantly completed the task of destroying a large number of enemy troops in the battlefields of Central Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Shandong, and Central Shandong, and turned to external operations in July last year, the enemy once harassed Shandong in a big way, and even tried their best to tout their so-called "strategic victory". The enemy once opened the Jiaoji Railway and the Jinpu Railway south of Jinan. On this basis, the enemy even dreamed of opening the entire Jinpu line in order to connect their Central and North China. But at that time, we pointed out that this was not a victory of offense, but a failure of offense. It was when the enemy changed from a comprehensive offensive to a partial offensive, and then from a partial offensive to a comprehensive defensive. The enemy's strategic attempt was impossible to realize. Sure enough, after the People's Liberation Army turned to the offensive on other battlefields, it also switched from defense to offense in East China without exception. The East China People's Liberation Army, which had lost almost all its county towns, has achieved a complete transformation of the entire Shandong battle situation in less than a year through the victory of Jiaohe in October last year, the victory of the eastern section of Jiaoji in November, the victory of Laiyang in December, the victory of the western section of Jiaoji in March this year, the victory of the central section of Jiaoji in April, the victory along the Jinpu line from May to July, and the victory of Jinan this time. Now Shandong, except for a few strongholds such as Qingdao, Yantai, and Heze, has been completely liberated, and the enemy's war plan in Shandong has been destroyed. The capture of Jinan, the enemy's most powerful stronghold in Shandong, has given the East China People's Liberation Army greater freedom than ever before. Under this circumstance, not only are the remaining enemies in Shandong in precarious situation, but the enemies in the entire East China and Central Plains will also suffer heavier blows. The complete liberation of East China and Central Plains is even more imminent. The long-term clamor of Chinese and foreign reactionaries about the so-called "consolidating North China, ensuring Central China," and even the so-called "clearing south of the Yellow River within a few months," has become a universal laughing stock.
    Jinan is one of the isolated strongholds that the Kuomintang has been holding for a long time. The cities in the same situation as Jinan, as far as the current situation is concerned, include Changchun, Shenyang, Jinzhou, Chengde, Baoding, Taiyuan, Anyang, Nanyang, and Yulin. What lessons should the people and Kuomintang troops in these cities learn from the liberation of Jinan? Although Jinan had 100,000 Kuomintang garrison troops, although they had American equipment, permanent layers of fortifications, materials prepared for long-term defense, air force support and coordination provided by the United States, and a large number of reinforcements allowed by Chiang Kai-shek gathered near Xuzhou, and Wang Yaowu, a well-known Kuomintang general, commanded them, they were completely wiped out in just eight days under the attack of the People's Liberation Army. This proves that the powerful offensive capability of the People's Liberation Army is something that the Kuomintang army cannot resist, and no Kuomintang city can resist the attack of the People's Liberation Army. So, what is the Kuomintang's purpose in stubbornly holding many isolated cities today, regardless of the life and death of the people? Isn't it just waiting for destruction? When the Kuomintang guards the city, they force the citizens to endure all kinds of extortion, bear all kinds of hard labor, and even force them to starve and freeze to death in large numbers. When the Kuomintang fails, they immediately bomb the citizens indiscriminately. Isn't this deliberately treating the people as enemies? And the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army can only be inexplicable victims. Since it is clear that they cannot hold on, why must they order a desperate defense? Since it is clear that no reinforcements will be dispatched, why must they order a desperate defense waiting for reinforcements? Isn't it deliberately deceiving people to their deaths? Some of the Kuomintang troops guarding Jinan understood this point. This is General Wu Huawen and his subordinates. They avoided the fate of meaningless sacrifice and received the understanding and welcome of the people, giving them the opportunity to serve the people in the future. But another part did not understand this point, and they were either taken prisoners or lost their lives in vain. These are two opposite paths and two opposite results. This is worth pondering and choosing by the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army. The battle of Jinan is over, and the battles of other besieged cities are coming one after another. Here, we would like to solemnly tell all enlightened people in the Kuomintang army in these cities: You should not die in vain! You should not force many innocent compatriots to die in vain with you! The path you should take is the path of Pan Shuo-duan, commander of the division in Southern Liaoning, Wang Jiashan, commander of the division in Yingkou, and Wu Huawen, commander of the army in Jinan. In this way, not only can our motherland and compatriots suffer less losses, and the people's liberation war will win victory across the country sooner, but you yourselves will also get a chance to atone for your crimes, transform yourselves, and serve the people.＊

### 庆祝济南解放的伟大胜利

    庆祝济南解放的伟大胜利
    人民解放军于九月十六日起开始向山东省会济南发起攻势。到二十四日，仅仅八天时间，就解放了敌人强固设防和重兵守御的济南市，全歼守敌十万余人，并争取吴化文军长率部起义。这个伟大的胜利，不但使国民党反动派及其美国主人目瞪口呆，甚至全国的人民也因为它的意外的迅速而惊异。
    济南的解放，对于整个战局的重大意义是很明显的。蒋介石在发动全面内战以后的一年多中间，始终是把华东战场当作他的军事重点，他曾经使用八十几个整编旅的兵力在这个方向，妄图在这里决定战争的胜负。当华东人民解放军的主力在苏中、苏北、鲁南、鲁中各战场光辉地完成了大量残灭敌军的任务，而于去年七月转入外线作战的时候，敌人曾经一度在山东大肆骚扰，并曾经竭力吹嘘他们的所谓“战略胜利”。敌人曾经打通过胶济路，打通过济南以南的津浦路，在这个基础上，敌人甚至还梦想过打通津浦全线，借以沟通他们的华中和华北。但是就在那时，我们就指出过这并不是什么攻势的胜利，而只是攻势的失败，是敌人由全面攻势降为局部攻势，又由局部攻势转入全面守势的时候，敌人的战略企图是不可能实现的。果然，人民解放军在其他战场转入进攻以后，在华东也无例外地反守为攻。曾经丧失过几乎全部县城的华东人民解放军，经过去年十月胶河的胜利，十一月胶济东段的胜利，十二月莱阳的胜利，今年三月胶济西段的胜利，四月胶济中段的胜利，五月至七月津浦沿线的胜利，直到这次济南的胜利，在不满一年中间，就造成了整个山东战局的彻底转变。现在山东除青岛、烟台、菏泽等少数据点外是被全部解放了，敌人在山东的战争计划是被摧毁了。济南这个敌人在山东最强大据点的攻克，使华东人民解放军获得了比以往任何时候更大的自由。在这个情况之下，不但山东的残敌岌岌可危，而且整个华东和中原的敌人也将遭受更加沉重的打击；华东和中原的全部解放，已经更加迫近；而中外反动派在长时期内关于所谓“巩固华北、确保华中”，乃至所谓在几个月以内“肃清黄河以南”的喧嚷，已经成为普遍的笑柄了。
    济南是国民党长期困守的孤立据点之一。与济南处于同样情形的，仅就目前而论，就还有长春、沈阳、锦州、承德、保定、太原、安阳、南阳、榆林等城市。这些城市中的人民和国民党军队，从济南的解放中，应该得到一些什么教训呢？虽然济南有十万国民党守军，虽然他们有美国的装备，有永久性的层层工事构筑，有准备长期固守的物资，有美国所供给的空军的接济和配合，又有蒋介石所允许的大量援军集结在徐州附近，还有国民党的有名将领王耀武指挥，但是在人民解放军的进攻之下，只在八天里面就全军覆没。这是证明人民解放军强大的攻击能力，已经是国民党军队无法抵御的了，任何一个国民党城市都无法抵御人民解放军的攻击了。那么，国民党今天不顾人民的死活，硬要困守许多孤城，究竟是为着什么？难道不是等候灭亡吗？当国民党守城的时候，他们强迫市民忍受种种勒索，担负种种苦役，甚至强迫他们大批地饿死冻死；到了国民党失败了，却又马上对市民滥施轰炸，难道这不是故意拿老百姓当仇人吗？而国民党军队的广大官兵，也只能是做着莫名其妙的牺牲品。既然明明守不住，为什么又一定要下令死守呢？既然明明没有援兵出动，为什么又一定要下令死守待援呢？难道不是故意骗人送死吗？守济南的国民党军队有一部分是明白了这一点，这就是吴化文军长和他的部下，他们避免了无谓牺牲的命运，并且得到了人民的谅解和欢迎，给予他们在今后能够为人民服务的机会。但另一部分就没有想明白这一点，而他们或者是做了俘虏，或者是白白地丧失了他们的生命。这是两条相反的道路，两种相反的结果。这是值得国民党军队的广大官兵加以思索和选择的。济南的战斗是过去了，其他被围城市的战斗正在接踵而来。在这里，我们愿意正告这些城市中国民党军队的一切开明人士们：你们不应当白白送死！你们更加不应当强迫许多无辜的同胞跟你们一起白白送死！你们应当走的道路就是辽南潘朔端师长、营口王家善师长和济南吴化文军长们的道路。这样，不但可以使我们的祖国和同胞少受一些损失，使人民解放战争早日在全国胜利，而且你们自己也得到一个将功折罪，重新改造自己和为人民服务的机会。＊
