【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper】 Mr. Lan Gongwu delivered a closing speech at the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference on August 19th. The original text is as follows:

　　"The North China Provisional People's Representative Conference has completed its tasks and is now honorably concluding.

　　Looking back on the work of the conference, in these short twelve or thirteen days, we have adopted the policy guidelines proposed by the North China Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, the Organic Outline of the North China People's Government, the Organizational Regulations for People's Power at the Village, County, and City Levels, the Electoral Law for People's Representatives at the Village, County, and City Levels, and the Agricultural Tax Regulations Bill. We have also sorted out over a thousand proposals. It cannot be said that the conference has not fully fulfilled its responsibilities.

　　This conference has two characteristics: First, the Organic Outline of People's Power at the Village, County, and City Levels and the Electoral Law for People's Representatives at the Village, County, and City Levels underwent detailed discussions and reviews. The principles were adopted and submitted to the government for detailed discussion and formulation. The Agricultural Tax Bill was passed in its entirety, but with several suggestions submitted to the government for consideration before promulgation and implementation. This method of voting did not exist in the old democratic politics. In the old democratic congresses, rejection or passage, even amendments, were made regardless of the content, only considering the interests of a few or as tools for power struggles. However, our conference was filled with the spirit of serving the people. Therefore, the passage of each bill was very cautious, considering the future implementation results, not entirely rejecting or entirely passing, but putting forward many valuable opinions for the government to consider, revise, and implement. This has created a precedent in the history of world legislation. Second, all of these thousand-plus proposals were put forward by the people. The review committee did not neglect any of these proposals. So many cases were carefully discussed; the review report was not empty ‘handed over to the government for implementation.’ It also proposed how these motions should be handled, attached many correct opinions, and then submitted them to the government.

　　In summary, in the dozen or so days of the meeting, all representatives demonstrated a genuine spirit of serving the people. Although this conference is not yet entirely perfect in terms of level, it demonstrated a true revolutionary spirit in action. The conference gloriously completed its tasks.

　　In addition, I would like to take this opportunity to express some opinions to the soon-to-be-established North China People's Government:

　　The tasks of the North China People's Government in the future will be very heavy. Its first and foremost important task is, of course, supporting the front. Today, the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek still exist. If we do not completely eliminate them (at least clean up the remaining forces in the North China region), the North China Liberated Area cannot be consolidated. Therefore, supporting the front is the first task, and all other tasks must revolve around this task. The government should organize all the manpower and material resources in North China to accomplish this most important task.

　　Another important task of the North China People's Government is to establish people's power at the village, county, and city levels in accordance with complete democratic procedures. The old democracy was a minority ruling the majority. The people nominally had the right to participate in politics, but in reality, they had no power at all, only casting a vote every few years. Lenin said: ‘Casting a vote without knowing what to vote for, the same ruling class comes to oppress us.’ The new democratic regime is fundamentally different. The people directly participate in politics, elect their own representatives to manage their own affairs, and exercise the four basic political rights of recall, removal, initiative, and referendum. People's power at the village, county, and city levels is the foundation of the new democratic regime. The Communist Party has cherished this ideal for many years, and Chairman Mao has been concerned about its realization every day. However, due to different circumstances in the past, it has not been fully realized. Today, due to the military victory of the People's Liberation Army, the North China Liberated Area is relatively consolidated, and here, we can begin to establish more complete people's power at the village, county, and city levels. The conference has passed a resolution that the work of establishing people's congresses at all levels from the village to the North China region must be completed within one and a half to two years, setting a precedent in North China for the rest of the country to follow. I hope that the North China People's Government and all the representatives present will devote all their efforts to complete this task. In the past, there were many obstacles because land reform had not been carried out. Today, land reform has been completed. If people's power at the village, county, and city levels is not established, land reform is not complete.

　　Finally, the conference has successfully completed its tasks, and everyone feels very honored. I hope that all representatives will continue to work hard to successfully complete the tasks of supporting the front and establishing democratic power, because this is not only the government's task, everyone has a responsibility."

### 华北临时人民代表会上　蓝公武先生致闭幕词

　　华北临时人民代表会上
  　蓝公武先生致闭幕词
    【本报特讯】蓝公武先生于八月十九日在华北临时人民代表大会上致闭幕词，原文如下：
    “华北临时人民代表大会完成了任务，今天光荣闭幕。
    我们回顾大会的工作，在这短短的十二、三天当中，通过了中共华北中央局提出的施政方针，通过了华北人民政府组织大纲、村县市人民政权组织条例、村县市人民代表选举法及农业税税则法案，并整理了一千多件提案，这不能不说大会完全尽了它的责任。
    这次大会有两个特点：一、对村县市人民政权组织大纲、村县市人民代表选举法经过了详细的讨论、审查，原则通过交政府详细讨论制订，对农业税法案是全部通过，不过又提了几点意见，交政府斟酌颁布实施。这种表决方法，在旧民主政治里边是没有的，在旧民主国会否决或通过乃至修正，都是不管内容如何，只顾少数人的利益，或作为争权夺利的工具。而我们这个大会，所有代表充满了为人民服务的精神，所以对每一法案的通过都非常慎重，并考虑到将来实行的结果，不是全部否决，也不是全部通过，提出许多宝贵的意见交政府斟酌修改实行。这给世界立法史上开创了先例。二、这一千多件提案都是人民提出的，审查委员会对这些提案并没有一点疏忽，那样许多案子都经过了细细的讨论；审查报告不是空空洞洞的‘交政府实行’，它并提出了：这些议案应该怎样处理，附加了许多正确意见然后提交政府。
    总起来说：在十几天的会议当中，所有代表都表现了真正为人民服务的精神。这次大会虽然在程度上还不十分完备，但在行动上则表现了真正的革命精神。大会光荣的完成了任务。
    此外，我还想利用这个机会对即将成立的华北人民政府表示一点意见：
    将来华北人民政府的任务是很繁重的，它的重要任务第一当然是支前。今天蒋介石反动势力还存在，不把它彻底消灭（至少要把华北区的残余势力肃清干净）华北解放区就不能巩固。因此，支前是第一个任务，其他一切任务都要围绕着这个任务去作。政府应该把全华北所有一切人力、物力组织起来，完成这个最主要的任务。
    华北人民政府的另一个重要任务，是按照完备的民主程序，来建立村县市人民政权。旧民主主义是少数人统治多数人，人民表面上有参政权，实际上一点权力也没有，不过每隔几年投一票而已。列宁讲：‘投一票，不晓得投个什么，同样的统治阶级的人来压迫我们。’新民主主义政权则根本不同，人民直接参政，人民自己选出自己的代表管理自己的事，并且还行使撤回、罢免、创议、复决四种基本政权。村县市人民政权，是新民主主义政权的基础，共产党多少年来就抱着这个理想，毛主席天天在挂念着它的实现，但因过去环境不同没有完全实现，而今天，由于人民解放军军事的胜利，华北解放区比较巩固了，在这里，可以开始建立进一步的完整的村县市人民政权。大会已经通过在一年半到两年之内必须把这个从村到华北区建立各级人民代表大会工作完成，在华北开下一个先例，全国按着进行。我希望华北人民政府及在座的各位代表应以全力完成这个任务。过去因为土地没有改革，有很多妨碍，今天土改完成了，若不建立村县市人民政权，土改不算完备的。
    最后，大会胜利完成了任务，大家都感觉很光荣，我希望各位代表还要继续努力把这个支前和建立民主政权工作胜利完成，因为这不仅是政府的任务，大家都有责任。”
