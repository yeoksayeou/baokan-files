　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th: The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Strive for the Final Victory of Completely Annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's Bandit Troops in the Northeast," calling on "the people of the Northeast and the People's Liberation Army of the Northeast, while liberating the entire Northeast, to ensure that not a single soldier or general of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, which has ravaged the people of the Northeast for more than two years, can go elsewhere to continue ravaging the people! We must cleanly, thoroughly, and completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's military forces in the Northeast to accelerate the final collapse of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the loyal pawns of American imperialism!"
    The editorial stated: Since the heroic Northeast People's Liberation Army launched the autumn offensive, it annihilated 30,000 enemies in one fell swoop on the Beining Railway, liberating Xingcheng, Suizhong, and Yixian; liberated the strategic stronghold of Jinzhou, completely annihilating 100,000 defending enemies, and captured alive Fan Hanjie, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast "Suppression Headquarters" and commander of the "Mechanized Corps" that American news agencies have vigorously touted; the 60th Army in Changchun revolted, and another Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast "Suppression Headquarters," Zheng Dongguo, led his troops to surrender, the New 7th Army and the First Army Corps, fully equipped with American weapons, collectively surrendered to the People's Liberation Army, and Changchun, the former capital of the Northeast, was declared liberated! Within half a month, 230,000 enemies were annihilated in succession, Jinzhou was taken to the south, and Changchun was captured to the north. Wherever the army pointed, it was like splitting bamboo. This is the most disastrous of Chiang Kai-shek's countless military defeats in the Northeast, and it is also the greatest of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's countless victories!
    The editorial analyzed the future of the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's defeated troops still remaining in the Northeast. The editorial pointed out that after Chiang Kai-shek lost Jinzhou and Changchun and all their defending troops and commanders at all levels, the 200,000 to 300,000 remnants of his defeated troops remaining in and around Shenyang had their retreat cut off. Air transport was "lacking in planes and oil" (as Chiang Kai-shek himself confessed), with no coal or food internally and no reinforcements externally, suffering from hunger and cold, and surrounded by enemies on all sides. They must choose their own path: either take Fan Hanjie's path—holding out stubbornly, making a futile and shameful sacrifice for American imperialism and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and waiting to be annihilated or captured; or take General Zheng Dongguo's path—leading their troops to surrender, collectively disarming, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices, and obtaining the leniency of the people; or take General Zeng Zesheng's path—recognizing right and wrong, loyalty and treachery, recognizing the direction of history, resolutely leading their troops to revolt, accelerating the downfall of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dynasty, performing meritorious service for the people, and atoning for their crimes. Apart from this, there is no other way out.
    The editorial called on the Northeast People's Liberation Army: Now the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau have assigned us, the Northeast military and civilians, the glorious task of "completely annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in the Northeast." We believe that we can victoriously complete this glorious task, just as we have victoriously completed all the glorious tasks in the past. "Forward! The heroic, battle-hardened, and ever-victorious Northeast People's Liberation Army! The people of the entire Northeast are supporting you with intense enthusiasm. This is the final battle to liberate the entire Northeast!"

### 东北日报社论号召：最后一战全歼东北蒋匪！

　　东北日报社论号召：最后一战全歼东北蒋匪！
    【新华社东北二十八日电】东北日报顷以“争取全歼东北蒋匪军的最后胜利”为题发表社论，号召“东北人民和东北人民解放军，要在解放全东北同时，还要将两年多来蹂躏东北人民的蒋匪军队，不让再有一兵一将还能到别处去继续蹂躏人民！要在东北干净、彻底、全部地消灭蒋介石在东北的军事力量，以加速美帝国主义的忠实走狗——国民党反动派统治的最后崩溃！”
    社论称：英勇的东北人民解放军展开秋季攻势以来，在北宁线上一举歼敌三万，解放兴城、绥中和义县；解放战略重镇锦州，全歼守敌十万，活捉东北“剿总”副总司令、为美国通讯社所极力吹嘘的“机械化兵团”司令范汉杰；长春六十军起义，另一位东北“剿总”副总司令郑洞国率部投降，全副美国装备的新七军及第一兵团向人民解放军集体缴械，曾经是东北首府的长春宣告解放！半月之内，连续歼敌二十三万，南取锦州，北克长春，大军所指，势如破竹。这是蒋介石在东北无数次军事失败当中最惨重的一次，也是东北人民解放军无数次胜利中最伟大的一次！
    社论分析了现在尚残留东北的蒋介石的残兵败将的前途。社论指出称：蒋介石在丧失了锦州长春及其全部守军与各级指挥官以后，他在沈阳及其周围地区残留下来的二三十万残兵败将，后路已经截断，空运则“机、油均缺”（蒋介石自供），内无煤粮，外无援兵，饥寒交迫，四面楚歌。他们必须选择自己的道路：或者是走范汉杰的道路——困守下去，替美帝国主义及卖国贼蒋介石作无谓而可耻的牺牲，等候歼灭或作俘虏；或者是走郑洞国将军的道路——率部投降，集体缴械，避免无谓牺牲，取得人民宽大；或者是走曾泽生将军的道路——认清是非忠奸，认清历史方向，毅然率部起义，加速蒋介石卖国皇朝的覆亡，为人民立功，将功赎罪。除此以外，已再无其他出路。
    社论号召东北人民解放军说：现在党中央和东北局指给我们东北军民的光荣任务，是要“全歼东北蒋匪军队”。我们相信我们能够胜利地完成这一光荣任务，正象我们过去曾经胜利地完成所有的光荣任务一样。“前进！英勇善战、百战百胜的东北人民解放军！全东北的人民都在紧张热烈地支援着你们。这是解放全东北的最后一战！”
