[Jinan Telegram] In order to overcome the shortage of draught animals and smoothly carry out wheat planting, various parts of Southern Hebei have corrected the deviations in dispatching labor, substitute plowing, and forcibly borrowing livestock. The masses' concerns have been relieved, and they are buying oxen in large numbers. In Sh窝 Village, the third district of Chengci, labor service is calculated on a daily basis, and a final account is settled at the end of the year. Newly added livestock must also be compensated for the whole year. For example, if an ox is added in early July, the labor service for the previous six months must also be made up. Old Jiu, a peasant who had been liberated, said, "If this is the case, who would dare to buy livestock!" After inspection and discovery, they helped the masses revise the method of dispatching labor: calculate from the time the livestock is added, calculate the amount of livestock that the whole village should provide each month, make up for shortages and return surpluses, and include the remaining work in the next month. The masses all believe that this regulation is reasonable, and they are buying livestock one after another. From the beginning of August to the end of the month, they added five oxen, which enabled the village to plant wheat smoothly. There are more than 20 households in Xiaogaozhuang, the first district of Yongzhi. They originally had eight oxen, but they were all sold because the village cadres dispatched labor unreasonably. Now, Wang Tinggui has just returned home from labor service, and the village chief, Hu Guangli, has sent him to deliver firewood again. Tinggui was unhappy, so he sold the ox. Furthermore, labor service is also dispatched for grinding flour for the families of soldiers. Some people are dissatisfied and say, "It is unreasonable to dispatch labor like this." The village chief also threatened the masses, saying, "If I don't dispatch labor well, I'll let you be the village chief!" No one dared to express their opinions. However, the masses passively resisted and said, "Sell all the oxen and see who will go on labor service?" The oxen of the village chief and the financial cadre have never been sent on labor service. Seeing that only their own oxen were left, and there was no way to dispatch them, they simply sold them as well. From then on, the village was devoid of oxen, which greatly hindered production. After the district cadres arrived in the village and discovered this problem, they convened a mass meeting to expose the malpractice of the village cadres not providing labor from their own oxen. The masses raised many opinions. The village chief and the financial cadre responded to the demands of the masses and admitted their mistakes, and the masses' enthusiasm was aroused. Now, the masses in the village have bought four oxen and are continuing to buy more. The village of Heya in Xin County rectified the dispatch of labor service. First, a meeting was convened with all 64 livestock-raising households in the village to explain the regulations on dispatching labor service. After discussion, it was stipulated that five small calves and three old oxen would not be sent on long-distance labor service, and the remaining 41 oxen and seven donkeys would all be sent on long-distance labor service. It was also proposed that whoever's ox was sent on labor service should not delay the autumn harvest and wheat planting. To this end, they freely organized seven mutual aid groups. Recently, the village sent out two large carts. Zhao Bai'er's ox was sent on labor service for four days and did not return. Zhao Suiqun from his group watered and harvested sorghum for his family. When Zhao Bai'er came back and saw that his sorghum had also been harvested and his family had water to drink, he said happily, "What else can I say? When others send out carts, we will do the same." Ren Jinshen, the village chief of Southwest Village in Nanguan, Daming City, returned from a community meeting and immediately convened a meeting of village cadres to discuss how to carry out large-scale wheat planting. Li Sen, the chairman of the farmers' association, said, "According to our village's situation, adding livestock is the main thing." After further research, they came up with ways to buy oxen through mutual aid and shareholding, or through joint plowing. Immediately, a mass meeting was convened. The village cadres first explained that whoever farms the public land and the land of the escaped households will harvest it, and there is no hope if wheat is not planted this year. They also guaranteed to the livestock-raising households that no one could use their livestock for free, and whoever used it, whether it was a village cadre or a militiaman, would have to pay. After the meeting, people gathered in small groups to discuss buying livestock. Under this publicity and encouragement, the whole village added ten livestock in ten days.

　　群众迫切要求差务负担公平
    成磁等地纠正支差不公
    群众纷纷添买耕牛
    【冀南电】为克服耕畜困难，顺利开展种麦，冀南各地纠正支差、代耕与强借牲口偏向，群众顾虑解除，大量添买耕牛。成磁三区沙窝村出差按天计算，到年底算总帐，新添的牲口也要按全年补齐。如七月初添了牛，还得把前六个月的差补上，翻身贫农老九说：“如果这样谁还敢买牲口哩！”经检查发现，便帮助群众修改了支差办法：啥时添牲口啥时算，每月全村该出多少牲口一月一算帐，长退短补，余下工计入下月。这种规定群众都认为合理，都纷纷添买牲口，从八月初到月底，就添了五头牛，使全村种麦能顺利进行。永智一区小高庄有二十多户，原有八头牛，因为村干派差不合理，所以都卖了。如今春王廷贵出差刚回家，村长胡光礼就又派他出车送柴火，廷贵不高兴，因此就卖了牛。再就是给抗属磨面也派差，群众有的不满说：“这样派差不合理。”村长还威胁群众说：“我不会派差，村长让给你当！”弄的谁也不敢提意见了。可是群众消极抵抗说：“把牛都卖掉，看谁去出差？”村长和财干的牛是一向不出差的，他们看到只剩下自己的牛，没法再派，就索性也卖了。从此这村就绝了牛影，大大的妨害了生产。区干到村后发现了这个问题，就召开群众会，揭发派差不公村干不出牛工的弊病。群众提了很多意见，村长和财干答复了群众的要求，承认了自己的错误，群众情绪才高涨起来。现在，该村群众已买四头牛，还在继续买。莘县河崖村整顿支差，首先召集了全村六十四家喂牲口户开会，说明支差条例。经过大家讨论规定五个小牛犊三个老牛均不出远差，下剩的四十一头牛，七头驴全出远差。并提出：今后谁的牛出了差，也不能耽误秋收种麦。为此他们自由组织了七个互助组，最近这村出了两辆大车，赵白二的牛出差四天没回来，他组赵遂群就给他家打水倒高粱。赵白二回来一看，他的高粱也倒了，家里也有水吃，很高兴的说：“这还说啥？等人家出车咱也这样作。”大名市南关西南村村长任晋绅，由小区开会回去，马上召开村干会研究如何开展大量种麦问题，农会主任李森说：“根据咱村情况，添牲口是主要的。”经进一步研究，想出互助集股买牛，或用合犋等方式。当即召开群众会，村干首先讲明村里公地逃亡户地谁种谁收，今年不种麦子没指望。并给喂牲口户保证谁也不能随便白使，不论村干民兵谁使也得拿钱。会后三五成群的商量买牲口，全村在此宣传鼓励下，十天添了十个牲口。
