Central and East China

　　Dredging Rivers to Reduce Flooding
　　This summer, Shuyang County in Central China mobilized more than 21,000 workers to repair over 130 *li* of dikes along the main and branch rivers of the Before and After Shu River, Liu Tang River, Chai Mi River, Guan Tian River, Gang River, Sha River, and Shan River, greatly reducing the floods between this summer and autumn. In Haiqi County (newly established county, between Haimen and Qidong), after more than 40,000 people worked hard for a month and a half to repair 200 *li* of river and sea embankments, most of the sections damaged by the tidal waves in June and July were restored.
　　In Gaomi County, East China, after the Wu Long River was dredged this spring, more than 60,000 *mu* of land that used to be flooded in previous years has had a bumper harvest. The average yield per *mu* is 210 *jin* of millet and 170 *jin* of sorghum, an average increase of more than 60 *jin* per *mu* compared to normal years and more than 150 *jin* per *mu* compared to last year.

　　华中华东
  　疏浚河流减轻水患
    华中沭阳县今夏动员民工两万一千余人，修复前后沭河、六塘河、柴米河、官田河、港河、沙河、山河等支干河堤一百三十余里，大大减轻今年夏秋之间的水患。海启县（新设县，海门、启东间）二百里江海堤岸，经四万余群众一个半月全力抢修，六七月间遭海潮损毁地段大部修复。
    华东高密县境五龙河，经今春疏浚后，两岸往年遭受水灾之六万余亩土地，已庆丰收。平均每亩可收谷子二百一十斤，嵇秫一百七十余斤，平均每亩较常年增产六十余斤，较去年增产一百五十余斤。（新华社）
