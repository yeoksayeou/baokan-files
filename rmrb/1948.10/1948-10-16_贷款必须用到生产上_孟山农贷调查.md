　　Loans Must Be Used for Production
　　-- A Survey of Agricultural Loans in Mengshan

Last winter, Mengshan Village in Jincheng granted 900,000 yuan in loans, all of which were given to ten newly emerging middle-peasant households that had risen from being hired laborers and poor peasants. Superficially, it seemed like the loans were given to the right people, but upon closer inspection, the approach was based on relief and a one-sided view of hiring poor laborers, without any consideration for developing production. In some cases, it was clear that production was impossible even with the loans, but they were still forcibly given, compelling the recipients to "produce and become wealthy." This led to a situation where those who needed loans couldn't get them, while those forced to take loans worried about spending the money and not being able to repay it. If they partnered with others for production, they feared losses; if they left the money idle at home, it wouldn't generate any profit, making it a burden. For example, Zhang Xiangwen, a widow with a twelve-year-old daughter, was an emancipated household with six mu of land but lacking labor. After the autumn hailstorm, they didn't have enough food. Based on this, she was forcibly given a loan of 90,000 yuan, which caused her great difficulty. Unable to engage in production herself, she feared spending the money and not being able to repay it. Therefore, she invested 45,000 yuan in a mutual aid group, and the remaining 45,000 yuan was transferred to two middle peasants for production. These two middle peasants then transferred it to households being struggled against. As a result, those being struggled against took the money and ran away. The 45,000 yuan invested in the mutual aid group earned 19,000 yuan in dividends over the winter. Later, buying grain used another 10,000 yuan of the loan, leaving 35,000 yuan. By July, she was still 10,000 yuan short and unable to repay the loan. She said that when the loan was given last year, she didn't want it, but the cadres repeatedly urged her, saying, "We're afraid people will say we're ideologically backward," so she reluctantly accepted it. "I can weave straw hats and raise silkworms without capital. Buying livestock is useless because there's no one to feed them or use them. I can exchange labor for plowing, and in a good year, the harvest is enough to eat. Raising silkworms and weaving straw hats provide enough clothes, and planting a season of rapeseed is enough for a year's oil and salt." This shows that similar loans in the past did not play a significant role in production.

This spring, Mengshan Village granted another 270,000 yuan, correcting the previous relief-oriented and one-sided approach to hiring poor laborers. After receiving the loan, Jiao Sixian's group distributed it to seven households and combined it with 662,000 yuan of idle capital, purchasing five head of livestock, which greatly promoted production. For example, Jiao Shengqun, an emancipated household with seven mu of land, worked as an escort for goods during the past winter and also hired laborers. The 40,000 yuan he borrowed was also invested in a mutual aid group for production. He received 8,000 yuan in dividends over the winter. This time, he borrowed more money and, combined with last winter's loan and dividends, bought half a cow. Guo Shouye said: "Last year's loans were large, but they were all spent separately and not used for production. This year's loans were all used to buy livestock, which is much better than last year."

During the inspection of Mengshan Village's loans, two farmers' forums were also held. Everyone provided many valuable suggestions for the bank's loan work. First, the use of loans must be decided based on the specific circumstances and urgent needs of local farmers. They said that in a village like Mengshan, the bank only needs to help us solve the problem of livestock and some vehicles and furniture. Originally, there was a shortage of labor, and because of the lack of livestock, labor had to be diverted to plow the land, which made the labor shortage even more acute. With livestock, the difficulty of lacking labor would be solved. Secondly, regarding the timing and duration of loans, the masses of Mengshan proposed that loans should be given after the wheat harvest. Although there is a shortage of labor now, there are more people planting wheat than before (for example, wheat fields accounted for 50% of the village's land in the past, but now they account for 70-80%), so there is a need to buy more livestock, and there is a need for loans. In addition, everyone has some money after the summer harvest, and at the same time, they have a better understanding of whether the year will be good or bad, so they can decide whether to dare to buy or not. For these reasons, more people buy livestock after the wheat harvest, and the need for loans is more urgent. As for the repayment period, it is generally at the beginning of autumn and the end of summer and at the end of the year, because farmers generally rely on the harvest of grain to repay their debts. If it is not during this season, farmers have no way to repay. Finally, the masses requested that credit cooperatives should be widely established in rural areas. Many people in Mengshan said: "Every time we borrow money and grain, it's from other people, and we're just called to attend a meeting." The rotation of loans should be accelerated so that people who urgently need loans can get them, and some people don't have to borrow loans they don't need. Jiao Baozhu said: "Money is a precious thing, you use it and I use it, it can't be left idle all the time." From these conversations, it can be seen that the masses are also very eager for the establishment of rural lending institutions. It is worthy of study and consideration.

### 贷款必须用到生产上——孟山农贷调查

　　贷款必须用到生产上
    ——孟山农贷调查
    晋城孟山村去年冬季贷款九十万元，完全贷给了十户由雇贫上升的新中农，从形式上看似乎是贷对了，但实际检查起来，是从救济观点与片面雇贫观点出发的，根本没有从发展生产上去考虑，甚至明知贷了也无法生产，可是还要硬贷，强迫贷，强迫他们去“生产发财”，这就形成了需要款的人贷不上；另一方面被迫贷上款的，却耽心花了没法归还；如果和人合伙生产又怕赔本，在家放着又不能生利，非常为难，成了一种负担。如张香文是个寡妇，有一个十二岁的闺女，是个翻身户，六亩地没劳力，秋天又遭了冰雹，粮食不够吃。贷款时，就根据这一点硬贷给了九万元。这可让她为难起来。自己不能出去生产，放着又怕花了没法还，因此入到互助组四万五千元，其余四万五千元转给两个中农去生产，这两个中农又转给被斗争户去生产，结果被斗争户把钱带上跑了。入到互助组的四万五千元，一冬天赚了一万九千元，后来买粮食又花了贷款一万元，还有三万五千元，一直放到七月还短下一万元，无法归还。她说去年贷款时，我不愿意，干部再三说，咱怕人家说咱思想不通，就勉强收下。我会编草帽养蚕，都不用本钱，买牲口没人喂也没人使，犁地时可以跟人家变上几个畜工，年景好收下粮食就够吃，养蚕，编草帽够穿，种一季油菜够一年油盐。这就说明过去类似的这样贷款对生产并没有起到一定的作用。
    今年春天又经孟山村贷了二十七万元，纠正了过去的救济观点与片面雇贫观点。焦思贤小组贷到款后，分贷给七户，又结合游资六十六万二千元，共买回牲口五头，对发展生产上起了很大的作用。如翻身户焦生群，有七亩地，去冬给人赶了一冬押车，又顾了嘴，所贷四万元，也是放在互助组生产，一冬天分了八千元红利，这次又贷了些款，连去年冬天的贷款和红利，买了半个牛。郭守业说：去年贷款多，可是都分散花了没有用到生产上，今年的贷款都买成牲口，这比去年强得多。
    这次检查孟山村的贷款时，还召集了两次农民座谈会。大家对银行的贷款工作提供了很多的宝贵意见。首先是在贷款的用途上，一定要根据当地农民的具体情况和迫切的要求，来决定贷款。他们说，象我孟山这个村，银行只要帮助我们解决了牲口问题与部分的车辆家具就行。原来劳力少，又因为缺牲口还要抽劳力去刨地，就更感到劳力缺乏。有了牲口就解决了没劳力的困难。其次关于贷款的时间与期限问题，孟山群众提出贷款时间应在麦收以后。现在虽然人力缺乏，但种麦的人比前多（如过去是麦地占全村土地十分之五，现在就占了十分之七八），就需要添买牲口，需要贷款。加之夏收后也都有些钱了，同时对年景好坏也有了把握，敢买不敢买才能作出决定。由于这些原因，麦收后买牲口的就比较多，需要贷款也就迫切。至于归还的期限，一般是秋头夏末和年关，因为庄稼人还帐一般都靠收下粮食来归还，不在这个季节上，农民是没办法来归还的。最后群众要求农村中应普遍设立信贷社。孟山有不少群众说：“回回贷款借粮都是人家，光叫咱去开个会”。应加速贷款的轮流使用，这样可以避免有人急用款贷不上，有的贷上款用不着。焦保珠说：“银钱是窜世宝，你用了我用，不能一直放着不动。”从这些谈话中可知群众对农村贷款机构的建立亦很迫切。值得研究考虑。
