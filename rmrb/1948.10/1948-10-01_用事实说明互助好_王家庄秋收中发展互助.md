　　Using Facts to Show the Benefits of Mutual Aid
　　Mutual Aid Develops During Autumn Harvest in Wangjiazhuang
　　[Jizhong Telegram] In Jin County, Wangjiazhuang used existing mutual aid teams to demonstrate the benefits of mutual aid with facts, organizing small-scale mutual aid for the autumn harvest. When the work team first arrived in the village to organize the masses for mutual aid, the village cadres believed that mutual aid teams had to have work-point recording and clearing, meeting systems, be permanent, and help those lacking labor and livestock. They felt it was impossible to start organizing under such requirements. Wang Faxiang, a branch committee member, said, "Our village doesn't have mutual aid teams, and the masses don't have a habit of mutual aid." Yin Xiuting, the women's association director, said, "As soon as you tell them to organize, they make excuses. One says the women have children and can't leave the house, another says they don't have time. It's impossible to organize." All the cadres were worried. Later, the district head asked: "Does your village have people who help each other with work, such as planting or doing other farm work?" Wang Fuchang, the water conservancy committee member, said, "There are many. Wang Mansheng, Wang Laopeng, and I have been working together since the first month of this year." Other cadres chimed in, saying that Cui Dazui and Cui Fengren had been working together for three years, and Wang Dahei and two others were harvesting together. Altogether, fourteen groups were mentioned, some for three or two years, some for a few months, consisting of two or three households or four or five households. They were all small-scale mutual aid groups organized spontaneously by the masses. That evening, more than twenty agricultural association group leaders who were labor activists with prestige in the various mutual aid groups were called to a meeting. District cadres first explained the Party's mutual aid policy and the administrative office's methods for rewarding labor mutual aid. Then, each group introduced its organizational process. Wang Mansheng said, "I have livestock but lack grass. Laopeng and Wang Fuchang have grass, but not enough livestock. Our water and dry land are mostly together, making it convenient to work." Fuchang said, "In the past, I lacked livestock and farm tools, and I also had official duties, so the crops never grew well. This year, my crops are as good as anyone else's, yielding three sacks of grain per mu." Wang Mansheng said, "When we worked together, the women in our families also helped collect grain. This year, we harvested twenty-two mu of grain early and stored it. We also harrowed twenty mu of wheat land. When I go out to work as a porter for a few days, it doesn't delay drinking livestock, carrying water, or weeding." Wang Laopeng had twenty-six mu of clay soil. It couldn't be hoed right after it rained. He couldn't hoe when it was too dry, and he couldn't manage it alone when it was neither too wet nor too dry. The three of them helped each other, first hoeing his land, solving his difficulties. Wang Laoheng said, "My livestock couldn't pull manure well, so I worked with Cui Heli. The two livestock pulled one cart together. At first, I had to beg people to help, but now it's not difficult to work together. When a person hoes land alone, they don't want to do it when it gets hot in the morning. With more people talking, they feel like the time passes quickly. Two people working together are stronger than one, and two people can do the work of three." The agricultural association group leaders who attended the meeting also felt that organizing was very necessary. All difficulties such as lack of labor, supporting the front, livestock, and busy work were solved. They went back and started propaganda. Starting from September 6th, they proposed that anyone, regardless of class, whether temporary or long-term, could participate voluntarily. Influenced by the practical benefits of Wang Mansheng's mutual aid group, they first cleared the minds of cadres and Party members, and after four days of deliberation through the propaganda of activists, they organized ten more small-scale mutual aid groups, totaling twenty-eight households. Including the previous mutual aid groups organized by Lian Yi, there were a total of twenty-four groups. They are currently engaged in mutual aid for the autumn harvest, harvesting one piece of land and cultivating another, preparing to sow wheat.
    Editor's Note: Wangjiazhuang is developing small-scale mutual aid broadly based on the experience of the masses. This has many benefits for solving the specific difficulties in the production of individual farmers at present. This style of work deserves to be promoted. However, it should be noted that we should not be satisfied with this. After all, this kind of mutual aid is relatively low-level and has many shortcomings. After the initial popularization, the leadership should focus on deepening the leadership of one or two groups to move them forward and create better experiences to promote the advancement of general small groups.

　　用事实说明互助好
    王家庄秋收中发展互助
    【冀中电】晋县王家庄通过旧有互助组，用事实说明互助好处，组织小型互助秋收。工作组刚到该村组织群众互助时，村干部以为必须有记工清工、会议制度、常年不散、带动着缺劳动力、缺牲口的才叫互助组，这样都感到没法着手组织。支部委员王法祥说：“我村没互助组，群众没互助习惯。”妇会主任尹秀亭说：“一说叫他们组织起来，他们就有了理，这个说妇女有孩子，出不了门，那个说没有空，组织不起来。”全体干部都很发愁。后来区长问：你村有这家帮那家做活的或是打插做活的没有？水利委员王福长说：“那可多啦，我和王满生、王老朋三家从今年正月插到现在。”别的干部也乱插嘴说，崔大嘴和崔凤人合伙三年了，王大黑等三家正合伙秋收。当时共念道出来了十四组，有三、二年、几个月，两三户、四五户不等，都是群众自发的小型互助组。当天晚上，便召集各互助组中劳动积极有威信的农会小组长二十余人开会，区干部先讲了党的互助政策，解释了行署奖励劳动互助的办法。接着，由各组介绍了组织过程。王满生说：“我有牲口缺草，老朋、王福长有草，牲口不够用，我们三家水地旱地多是在一块，做活方便。”福长说：“过去我缺牲口农具，又办公，每年庄稼长的都不好；今年我的庄稼比谁家长的也不坏，每亩谷合三口袋。”王满生说：“我们插起来，家里妇女也插起来卡谷子，今年二十二亩谷子早早打到囤里了。麦地也打耙好了二十亩。我出去当几天夫，饮牲口、担水、锄地也耽误不了。”王老朋有二十六亩胶泥地，刚下了雨不能锄，下雨后多呆几天地皮干了也不能锄，不干不湿的时候他一个人锄不过来，三个人互助着，先给他锄，解决了他的困难。王老恒说：“我牲口拉不动粪，跟崔合利插起来，两个牲口拉一车。起先得求人，插起来也不遭难了。一个人锄地，到上午热了就不愿做，人多了说着话，觉着工夫不大就到了头，俩人比着一人强，俩人能做三人的活。”到会的农会小组长们也都感到组织起来非常必要。缺劳动力、支前、牲口、忙活等一切困难都解决了。回去便进行宣传。从九月六日开始发动，提出不分阶层，不论临时长期，都可自愿参加。在王满生互助组的实际好处影响下，首先打通干部、党员的思想，通过积极分子进行宣传，经过四天酝酿，又组织起了小型互助组十个，共二十八户。连以先的旧互助组共二十四组。正在互助秋收，收一片耕一片，准备种麦。
    编者按：王家庄以群众经验为基础，普遍发展小型互助，对目下解决个体农民生产中具体困难有很多好处，此种作风值得发扬。但应注意不要满足于这一点，因为这种互助毕竟较为低级，有许多缺点，领导上应在初步普及之后，抓紧深入一二组领导，使其更向前进，创造更好的经验，推动一般小型组前进。
