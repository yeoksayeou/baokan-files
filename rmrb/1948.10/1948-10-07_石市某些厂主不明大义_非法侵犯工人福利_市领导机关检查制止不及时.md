[Special Dispatch]

　　[Our Paper Special News] General Branch Reporters Report: Shijiazhuang has failed to fully develop the struggle on two fronts in implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital. As a result, recently, some factory owners, under the pretext of "protecting industry and commerce," have repeatedly engaged in illegal acts of undermining trade unions and infringing on workers' welfare. This has not aroused serious attention from the city's leading organs, which is worthy of attention. Wang Yushun, manager of the Limin Iron Factory in the Third District of the city, once cast hand grenades for the Kuomintang's Third Army during the Kuomintang's rule. After the city was liberated, the government did not hold him accountable for his past and allowed him to jointly operate the factory with others. This is a manifestation of our party's magnanimous policy. However, after operating the factory, he illegally sought profits. This summer, various villages in Huolu County ordered a batch of waterwheels from the factory with the fruits of land reform and paid a deposit in full, signing a contract. He hoarded coal and iron with the deposit instead of making waterwheels. When the deadline arrived, he did not deliver the goods and falsely accused the buyers of violating the contract by being late to pick up the goods, hoping to delay the delivery. This breach of contract has greatly affected farmers' production, this is the first. He is also very harsh to the workers in the factory, not giving them any holidays each month, and the working hours are 14 hours a day. The workers very legitimately and not excessively requested one day off per month and to reduce the working hours to 12 hours per day, he was extremely dissatisfied, saying "the trade union's advocacy of holidays affects production." He often interfered with workers attending trade union meetings under the pretext of "developing production," this is the second. On September 18, he dismissed Liu Jinyuan, a sand casting technician, from the factory for no reason. After workers and the trade union questioned him, he admitted his mistake and allowed Liu to return to work. When the reporter visited Rao Weihua, deputy secretary-general of the city's trade union preparatory office, and Wang Zhiyuan, head of the industry department, they said that the factory's dismissal of workers was due to the fact that the majority of people in the factory were Catholics who ostracized non-Catholic workers. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the majority of people in the factory are not Catholics. Liu Jingzhai, manager of the Huasheng Wind Bow Factory, has consistently violated the law and opposed workers joining the trade union. This spring, the trade union office in the district issued eight theater tickets to the factory workers to watch a play. More than half of the ten-odd workers in the factory went to see the play. Liu took the opportunity to sow discord between the workers and the trade union, giving each of the workers and apprentices who did not go to see the play 25,000 yuan to go to a restaurant and watch a play. When the trade union office in the district convened a meeting of workers, Liu deliberately gave the workers towels and soap, saying "joining the trade union requires paying membership fees, buying shares in the cooperative, all the money is handed over." Under his instigation, the workers were prevented from attending the trade union, only sending a few apprentices to the meeting to perfunctorily respond. Fang Junchang, manager of the Tianmao Iron Factory in the Fourth District of the city, does not allow workers and apprentices to go out for recreation after work, and does not clearly stipulate wages, only stipulating that certain wages and "gifts" will be given at the end of the year. He Ruzong, a sand casting technician in the factory, has always been actively working. Because he once took two apprentices out for recreation after work, he and his brother were dismissed from the factory. Although the trade union office in the district requested permission for He to return to work, it was still rejected. When He left the factory, Fang owed He four months' wages, and did not pay according to the general wage standard and rice price, deducting a lot of He's wages. Zhang Zhixin, manager of the newly established Yizhong Iron Factory in the district, treated Liu Chou, the worker who contributed the most to the establishment of the factory, extremely harshly. In August, Liu fell ill due to overwork. Zhang not only did not take responsibility for treatment, but also dismissed Liu Chou with 200,000 yuan under the pretext of freedom to hire workers. Feng Dianyiao, manager of the Xiexing Iron Factory in the district, scolded workers at will. In August, Jin Yufeng, an apprentice in the factory, could not bear his insults and reasoned with him. He drove Jin out of the factory overnight. After the reporter visited the leading organs of the city, the above-mentioned incidents of violating workers' interests were all vague. Some leading organs in the city, in implementing the Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce, have opposed some left-leaning adventurist mistakes, which is completely correct and necessary, and has achieved certain results, which is commendable; but on the other hand, failing to go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation, and allowing the behavior of a few factory owners infringing on the legitimate interests of workers to go unchecked without stopping and fighting against it, is harmful and should be paid attention to.

### 石市某些厂主不明大义　非法侵犯工人福利  市领导机关检查制止不及时

　　石市某些厂主不明大义
    非法侵犯工人福利
    市领导机关检查制止不及时
    【本报特讯】总分社记者报导：石家庄在执行劳资两利方针上，未能充分展开两条战线的斗争，因之对最近某些工厂厂主借口“保护工商业”非法破坏工会侵犯工人福利的行为，层出不穷，而未引起该市领导机关的严重注意，深值注意。该市第三区利民铁工厂经理王玉顺，在蒋匪统治时期曾代匪第三军铸造过手榴弹，该市解放后，政府不咎既往，准其与他人合股经营该厂，这是我党宽大政策。但他在经营工厂之后，竟非法牟利。今夏获鹿各村以土改果实向该厂订购水车一批，缴足了定钱，并订立了合同，他竟将定钱囤积煤铁，未做水车，到期不交货，反诬陷买主迟来取货违背合同，以冀延期交货。此一违约行动影响农民生产甚巨，此其一。对待厂内工人又甚苛刻，每月不给休假，每天工时十四小时，工人十分正当地不过分地要求每月休假一天及缩短工时至每天十二小时，他极为不满，说“工会提倡放假影响生产”。且常借口“发展生产”干涉工人到工会开会，此其二。九月十八日复无故将翻沙技工刘金元开除出厂，经工人与工会提出质问，始承认错误让刘复工。当记者往访市总工会筹备处副秘书长饶卫华及行业部长王志远时，彼等告称：该厂开除工人乃厂内大多数人系天主教徒排斥教外工人所致。但据记者调查，该厂大多数人并非天主教徒。华盛风弓厂经理刘敬斋一贯违法反对工人参加工会，今春该区工会办事处发给该厂工人八张戏票看戏，该厂工人十余人，有半数的工人去看戏，刘乘机挑拨工人与工会关系，发给每个未去看戏的工人学徒二万五千元上馆子和看戏。该区工会办事处召集工人开会，刘故意发给工人手巾肥皂，说“参加工会要缴会费，向合作社入股，钱都交了”。在其挑拨下，工人被阻不去参加工会，只派几个学徒到会聊应故事。该市第四区天茂铁工厂经理房俊昌，不许工人学徒下工后外出游玩，不明确规定工资，只规定年底发给若干工资和“馈送”。该厂翻沙技工贺汝宗素来工作积极，因有一次在下工后带两个学徒外出游玩，竟被连同其弟开除出厂，该区工会办事处虽要求准许贺复工，仍遭拒绝。当贺离厂时，房欠贺四个月的工资，竟不按一般工资标准及米价发给，克扣贺工资很多。该区新设之义中铁工厂经理张志信，对该厂开设时尽力最大之工人刘臭苛待至极，八月间刘因劳成疾，张不仅不负责医治，反借口雇用工人自由，竟以二十万元将刘臭开除出厂。该区协兴铁工厂经理冯殿耀更随意责骂工人，八月间该厂学徒金玉锋不甘受其辱骂，向他说理，他竟将金连夜赶出厂外。上述各种违犯工人利益事件，经记者走访该市各该领导机关，均语焉不详。该市某些领导机关，执行党保护工商业政策，反对了某些左倾冒险主义错误，是完全正确的和必需的，而且已获得一定成绩，这是值得嘉许的；但另一方面不深入下层了解情况，对少数工厂厂主侵犯工人正当利益的行为，放任自流不加制止和斗争，则是有害的，望予注意才好。
