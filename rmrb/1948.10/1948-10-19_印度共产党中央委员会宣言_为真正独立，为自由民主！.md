　　Manifesto of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India
　　For True Independence, For Freedom and Democracy!
The Communist Party of India’s analysis and proposition for the current situation in India can be roughly seen from the manifesto issued by the Central Committee of the CPI on March 21 this year; the full text of the manifesto is reprinted here for your reference. —Editor
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    International Situation
    Anglo-American imperialism is making sinister efforts to salvage the impending doom of the capitalist social order.
    They are providing loans to war-torn European countries to support reactionary regimes, forcing these countries to sell their economic and political independence to American imperialism. They are providing economic and military aid to reactionary forces in China and Greece to oppress democratic forces. They are using alliances with "national" leaders who have political influence over the masses, using false independence to deceive the colonial people, and using greater concessions to the national bourgeoisie to continue to maintain their rule over colonies and dependencies.
    They are frantically making political and military preparations in an attempt to launch a new world war against the Soviet Union and other democratic countries.
    Thus, the world is divided into two camps—the imperialist camp led by American imperialism, and the anti-imperialist democratic camp led by the Soviet Union.
    This democratic camp is composed of the people's forces all over the world, and today it is already stronger than the imperialist forces. The right wing of social democratic parties in various countries, according to the needs of their capitalist masters, are splitting the people's camp. Under the direction of American imperialism, the right wing of various socialist parties are appearing as a disguised "third force," attacking the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the communist parties of various countries, in order to protect the capitalist order.
    No matter how insidious the schemes of American imperialism, since the Second World War defeated the fascist powers, the world democratic camp has been advancing by leaps and bounds. The strength and prestige of the Soviet Union, a socialist and worker-class-ruled country, has grown remarkably. The establishment of people's republics in Eastern Europe, where power belongs to the working people led by the working class, has dealt another major blow to world capitalism. The development of communist parties in various European countries demonstrates the strength of the working class, the instability of various existing regimes, and the maturity of the revolutionary movement. The post-war revolutionary era has led the colonies onto the road of armed struggle to gain complete independence and democratic countries.
    On the one hand, American imperialism is attacking the sovereignty of independent countries, intensifying its control over dependent countries, and bringing the world into another devastating war. On the other hand, the working class around the world is leading the working masses in the struggle for the sovereignty of various countries, people's democracy, and lasting peace.
    British Imperialism in India
    As soon as the war ended, an unprecedented mass struggle gripped the imperialist rulers in India. The working class, which had received almost no compensation for the ever-increasing cost of living, began to fight back. The comprehensive strike wave of 1946 reached an unprecedented height, affecting two million workers and causing twelve million working days lost.
    Inflation, high prices, the impoverishment of large numbers of peasants, famine, and the oppression of landlords forced the peasants to take risks. The agricultural areas of India have become a large volcano that erupts from time to time. Examples of peasants taking risks can be seen in the great struggle of Tebhaga in Bengal Province, the struggle in Telangana area of the Nizam Territory (i.e., Hyderabad State, the largest princely state in India—Translator), the struggle of native tenant farmers in Bombay, and the struggle for "Bagashid" land in the Khar province.
    These struggles raised a single demand—land to the tiller.
    The oppressed people of the various princely states of India began to rebel against the feudal autocracy. Their struggle reached new heights, such as in Kashmir and Travancore.
    The people's struggle began to undergo a revolutionary transformation, resulting in political general strikes, conflicts between the police and the people, and armed combat. The revolutionary spirit of the people influenced the armies of the princely states. The mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy also cast terror in the hearts of the imperialist rulers and bourgeois national leaders.
    Imperialism understood that it could no longer maintain its rule in the old way without the participation of national capitalists in state power. The feudal classes alone were not enough to support its shaky rule. Therefore, British imperialism changed its strategy and adopted new methods to preserve its rule. This new strategy is embodied in the Mountbatten Plan. The acceptance of the Mountbatten Plan was the culmination of the betrayal of the revolutionary struggle by the leadership of the National Congress and the Muslim League.
    Although the Indian bourgeois leaders boasted that independence had been achieved, the fact is that the struggle for freedom by the common people had been betrayed, and the national leaders had made a treasonous deal behind the backs of the starving people, betraying every slogan of the democratic revolution.
    Every feature of the Mountbatten Plan shows that it does not truly represent a retreat of imperialism, but rather represents its cunning counter-offensive against the growing power of the Indian people.
    First, this plan divided India on a religious basis. The division allows imperialism to create permanent animosity between Indians and Muslims, and, when necessary, to create war fever between the two dominions of India and Pakistan for imperialist interests. Organizing riots and using war calls to mislead the revolutionary movement, division is a ready-made weapon. Division is one of the greatest attacks on the unity and integrity of the democratic movement.
    Second, this plan left the princes of the princely states, the longtime friends of the American imperialist order, intact and increased their bargaining power.
    Third, the main economic lifelines are still in the hands of the imperialists, who are successfully using these economic lifelines to incite the bourgeoisie against the masses, crush the democratic revolution, and consolidate the new front of imperialism, princes, landlords, and the bourgeoisie.
    Fourth, the highest organs of the state are controlled by the servants of imperialism. The ultimate control of imperialism will be maintained through military alliances.
    What the Mountbatten Plan gave to the people was not true but false independence. British dominance has not ended, but the form of dominance has changed. For a long time, the bourgeoisie was excluded from state power and opposed state power. Now, in order to undermine and bury the national democratic revolution in blood, the bourgeoisie has been granted a portion of state power.
    The Role of the "National Government"
    The actions and movements of the "National Government" since August 15 (August 15, 1947, was the date India gained "independence"—Translator) fully confirm the above understanding of the purpose behind the Mountbatten Plan. These actions resolutely indicate that the leadership of the National Congress, a bourgeois leadership, is cooperating with imperialism.
    The Constituent Assembly arranged by the leaders of the "National Government" has formulated an authoritarian draft constitution. The working people will get nothing but the right to vote once in a long time. The draft constitution stipulates that people can be arrested without warrants and imprisoned without trial. The draft constitution authorizes the governors of the provinces to act arbitrarily, to legislate by decree, and to rule by proclamation. The draft constitution makes reactionary provisions for the "second chamber" in the provinces, allowing the governors to appoint members of the "second chamber" to ensure that the big bourgeoisie and its spokesmen have a dominant position in the parliament. The provincial constitution examples do not recognize the basic right of national self-determination and do not stipulate proportional representation; without proportional representation, progressive parties and minority groups cannot obtain fair representation. The provincial constitution examples do not stipulate the re-division of tribal and other backward areas, and the establishment of autonomous regions or provinces; without this, these backward people cannot protect and develop themselves economically and culturally.
    According to this charter, the basic rights of the working people, such as the right to work, the right to a living wage, the right to equal pay for equal work, the right to old-age care, and the right to assistance in illness and unemployment, have not found a place and are not considered basic rights protected by the national constitution. However, there is a clause in the bill of rights that provides legislative and constitutional protection for the property and privileges of the big bourgeoisie, stating that the property belonging to any person or company shall not be taken for public use unless adequate compensation is paid, thus preventing any plan to nationalize industries (including foreign manufacturers) through constitutional guarantees.
    Since August 15, the so-called National Government has been implementing the plan of the Indian bourgeoisie to oppose industrial nationalization, oppress workers, increase the workload of workers, and freeze wages under the pretext of stopping rising prices.
    It is ruthlessly suppressing all peasant movements, fully satisfying the landlords. Even its hesitant proposals for agricultural reform stipulate that landlords should be given rich compensation, but do not stipulate anything about land to the tiller. They preserve the landlord system in different forms. The proposed agricultural legislation is an attempt to split the peasant movement and expand the current base of the bourgeois government.
    The provincial governments under the leadership of the central government have passed some public security laws, which are arbitrarily used to deal with the democratic movements of workers, peasants, and students.
    The so-called National Government is crushing the struggles of the people of the princely states against the order of the princes and suppressing the peasant struggles within the princely states. It is rescuing the princely system and exaggerating the fact that several princely states have joined India as a great victory for the people, thus diverting the people's attention from the democratic struggle.
    With regard to ethnic minorities, it adopts a policy of ethnic discrimination, and oppression of ethnic minorities has become a deliberate policy. Patel's (the current Deputy Prime Minister of the Indian government—Translator) praise of the RSS (a fascist hooligan gang organization—Translator) and alliance with the Hindu Mahasabha prove this. In the so-called National Government, ethnic discrimination is so strong and powerful that even after Gandhi was assassinated by RSS members, despite the excited anger of civilians opposing ethnic discrimination, the arrests and bans on RSS members were only a show. The "National Government" not only did not truly suppress ethnic discriminatory groups, but instead used this opportunity to suppress the Communist Party.
    According to Nehru's own statement: these ethnic discrimination and other reactionary policies of the "National Government" did not cause any divisions in the cabinet. In Nehru's own words, there were no political divisions, only "temperamental" divisions.
    Nehru's Cooperation with Imperialism
    The policy implemented by the Nehru government is a policy of cooperation with Anglo-American imperialism. Anglo-American imperialists are signing "agreements" with the "National Government" to obtain India's strategic position. The "National Government" has agreed not to discriminate against foreign capital and to encourage it, not to nationalize industries, not to impose tariffs without the consent of Britain and the United States, and to jointly organize companies to exploit the Indian people. This policy logically means that India cannot be fully industrialized and can only develop certain industries that are suitable for the interests of British and American capitalists.
    The Nehru government's foreign policy shows the same cooperation.
    From the beginning, Pandit Nehru adopted the line of forming a so-called third group—this line represents the interests of the big bourgeoisie and at the same time keeps India out of the anti-imperialist and democratic camp. When a life-and-death struggle is going on between the anti-imperialist democratic camp and the imperialist camp led by American imperialism, Nehru refuses to stand in the former camp and pretends to be neutral. This so-called neutrality between aggressors and non-aggressors, between war-mongers and peace-lovers, between expansionists and freedom-loving camps, is just a mask to cover up its cooperation with Anglo-American imperialists. In recent months, the "neutral" mask of the Nehru government's foreign policy has been torn off. On all decisive issues, the Indian delegation to the United Nations has adopted an anti-democratic and pro-imperialist stance. It voted in favor of the "Little General Assembly," which was created to paralyze the democratic forces within the United Nations. It voted against the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and it allowed itself to be used by American imperialism on the issue of Ukraine's representation in the Security Council.
    Especially on issues that are very important to the nations of Asia, it remains silent and refuses to act on the issues of the American-backed war against the Chinese people and the French colonial war in Vietnam; the same is true of the Japanese peace treaty issue, where it is actually standing on the same line as Anglo-American imperialism. Regarding the American-backed Dutch war against the Indonesian people, it agreed to sell out the Indonesian freedom struggle, which was completed by the recent treaty, was stirred up by a mediation committee initiated and dominated by the United States, and was welcomed by President Truman.
    British imperialists are making open allusions to forming an anti-Soviet bloc that includes their overseas empire. At the same time, news has come that Southeast Asian countries, including India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon, will form an alliance consistent with Britain. There are also some reports that Britain will send a military delegation to India to improve India's defense organization.
    This shows that the "National Government," which represents the Indian bourgeoisie, is dragging India into the anti-Soviet and anti-democratic bloc, into the American and British imperial defense plans in the East.
    Characteristics of Post-War Development
    The great change that has taken place in Indian post-war politics is this remarkable truth, namely, that the Indian bourgeoisie, or in other words, the leadership of the National Congress, which represents the bourgeoisie, has abandoned its anti-imperialist mission and has become a cooperationist, and therefore a reactionary.
    Two major facts determine this path.
    First, the ever-increasing revolutionary upsurge has made the Indian bourgeoisie fear the masses. It can no longer gamble on the mass movement to obtain concessions from imperialism.
    Second, seeing that the Indian market is shrinking due to the economic crisis, the Indian bourgeoisie itself needs foreign markets, but reliance on foreign markets is tantamount to reliance on British and American colonies and semi-colonies. This allows Britain and the United States to force it to accept any conditions before allowing it access to these markets. The economic foundation of this cooperation was laid during the war.
    First, during the war, the Indian bourgeoisie earned extraordinarily huge profits and became rich.
    The ever-increasing accumulation of liquid capital has led the Indian bourgeoisie to seek investment in all directions.
    Second, in the capitalist world, British and American imperialists have a monopoly on the capital goods that the Indian bourgeoisie urgently needs. In order to obtain these goods, the Indian bourgeoisie is prepared to please British and American imperialists in every way and accept any conditions.
    The economic foundation of this cooperation has been further strengthened by the post-war capitalist crisis, which is due to the partial accumulation of capital, the loss of capitalist markets in the new democratic countries, the production crisis, and the simultaneous excessive accumulation of unsold inventories, and finally the new threat of a world-scale crisis of "overproduction" and plummeting prices. The determination of the working people around the world to resolve this crisis through revolutionary methods is driving all reactionary forces to form a camp, regardless of the conflicts of interest between them in the course of the crisis.

　　印度共产党中央委员会宣言
  　为真正独立，为自由民主！
    印度共产党对于印度现状的分析和主张，可以从印共中央今年三月二十一日所发表的宣言看出一个大概；兹将该宣言全文转载于此，供大家参考。——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    国际形势
    英美帝国主义正在作凶险的努力，企图挽救资本主义社会秩序的迫近的厄运。
    他们正在向被战争蹂躏的欧洲各国提供贷款支持各反动政权，而逼迫这些国家把她们的经济和政治独立，出卖给美国帝国主义。他们正把经济和军事援助给予中国和希腊的反动势力，去压迫民主力量。他们正在利用和对群众有政治影响的“民族”领袖们成立同盟，利用假的独立欺骗殖民地人民，利用向民族资产阶级较大让步等方法，来继续维持他们对殖民地及附属国的统治。
    他们正在疯狂地作政治及军事准备，企图发动一次新的反对苏联及其他各民主国家的世界大战。
    这样，世界分为两个阵营——美帝国主义领导的帝国主义阵营，和苏联领导的反帝国主义民主阵营。
    这个民主阵营由全世界的人民力量组成，今天它已经比帝国主义力量更为强大。各国的社会民主党右翼，按照他们的资本主义主子们的需要，正在分裂人民阵营，在美帝的指使下，各社会党右翼正在以伪装的“第三种力量”出现，攻击苏联、各人民民主国家以及各国共产党，以保护资本主义秩序。
    无论美帝国主义如何的阴谋诡计，自从第二次世界大战打败了法西斯列强之后，世界民主阵营一直在大踏步前进，社会主义和工人阶级统治的国家苏联的力量和威信，已惊人地增长起来。权力属于工人阶级所领导的劳动人民的东欧各人民共和国，造成了对世界资本主义的另一大打击。欧洲各国共产党的发展，表现出工人阶级的力量，各种现政权的不稳定以及革命运动的成熟。战后的革命时代，已使各殖民地走上武装斗争，以获得完全独立和民主国家的道路。
    一方面美帝国主义正在袭击各独立国家的主权，正在加紧掌握各从属国和将世界带入另一毁灭性的战争，同时另一方面，全世界的工人阶级正在领导着劳动群众、争取各国的主权。人民的民主和永久的和平。
    英帝国主义在印度
    战争一经结束，空前的群众斗争立刻抓住了在印度的帝国主义统治者。对不断上升的生活费用几乎没有得到任何补偿的工人阶级，开始还击了。一九四六年的全面罢工浪潮，达到了空前的高度，影响及于二百万工人，造成了一千二百万工作日的损失。
    通货膨胀，物价高涨，大量农民的赤贫化，饥荒和地主的压迫，逼使农民挺而走险。印度的农田区，变成了一个时时爆发的大火山。农民的挺而走险的例子，可见之于孟加拉省德巴加的大斗争，尼萨姆领地（即海德拉巴特邦，是全印最大的王公土邦——译者）德伦加那地方的斗争，孟买土著雇农的斗争，以及哈尔省争取“巴加希得”土地的斗争。
    这些斗争中提出了一个唯一的要求——耕者有其田。
    印度各土邦的被压迫人民开始起来叛变，反对封建专制制度。他们的斗争达到了新的高度，如在喀什米尔和德拉梵柯邦。
    人民斗争开始有了一个革命性的转变，结果是政治性的总罢工，警察和人民间的冲突，以及武装的战斗。人民的革命精神，影响了土邦的军队，印度皇家海军的叛变，也在帝国主义统治者和资产阶级民族领袖们的心里罩上了恐怖。
    帝国主义明白，假使国家政权中依然没有民族资产者参加，他就不能再用老方法维持它的统治了，单是各封建阶级已不足以支撑它动摇的统治了。于是英帝国主义改变了他的战略，采取新的方法来保存它的统治。这个新战略，就体现在蒙巴顿计划中。蒙巴顿计划的接受，是国民大会党和回教同盟领导机构出卖革命斗争的顶点。
    虽然印度资产阶级领导者炫耀说独立已经获得，事实是平民的自由斗争已被出卖，而民族的领导者已经在饥饿中的人民的背后做了一桩卖国的买卖，背弃着民主革命的每一个口号。
    蒙巴顿计划的每一个特点，都显示着它并不真正代表帝国主义的一个撤退，而是代表着它对印度人民日益增长的力量的狡猾的反攻。
    第一、这计划以宗教为基础，分裂了印度。分裂使帝国主义能在印族人和回族人之间制造永久的仇视，并在需要时为了帝国主义的利益，在印回两自治领之间制造战争寒热病。组织暴乱，以及用战争的号召来使革命运动走入歧途，分裂是一个现成的武器。分裂是对于民主运动的团结和完整的最大攻击之一。
    第二、这计划使土邦王公们，美帝国主义秩序的多年的朋友，完好无损，并且提高了他们的讨价还价权力。
    第三、主要的经济命脉，还在帝国主义者们的手里，他们顺利地利用着这些经济命脉，来使资产阶级起而反对群众，粉碎民主革命，巩固帝国主义、王公们、地主们和资产阶级的新阵线。
    第四、国家的最高机关，控制在帝国主义的仆从们手里。帝国主义的最后控制权，将通过军事同盟而被保持。
    蒙巴顿计划给与人民的，不是真的而是假的独立。英国的支配权并未终结，不过支配的形式改变了。很久以来，资产阶级被摒除在国家政权以外，并反对国家政权。现在，为了破坏并把民族民主革命埋葬在血泊里，资产阶级获得了一部分的国家政权的赐与。
    “国民政府”的作用
    “国民政府”自从八月十五日（一九四七年八月十五日为印度获得“独立”之日——译者）以来的行为和举动，充分证实了上述对于蒙巴顿计划背后目的的了解。这些行动，断然表示着国民大会的领导机构，一个资产阶级的领导机构，是和帝国主义合作。
    “国民政府”的领袖们所安排的立宪会议，制定了一个权力主义的宪法草案。劳动人民除了隔很长时间有一次投票权外，什么都不会得到。这宪草规定逮捕人不需拘票，监禁人不需审判。这宪草授权各省省长随意行动，用敕令来立法，用布告来统治。这宪草在各省的“第二议会”方面，作了反动的规定，允许省长们指定“第二议会”的议员，这样来保证大资产阶级及其发言人们在议会中得到支配的地位。省宪范例并不承认各民族自决的基本权利，并没有规定比例代表制；没有了比例代表制，各进步政党和少数集团就不能得到公平的代表权。这省宪范例并未规定重行划分部落及其他落后区域，以及成立自治的区域或省，没有这一点，这些落后人民就不能在经济上和文化上保护和发展自己。
    按照这宪章，劳动人民的基本权利，如工作权，维持生活的工资权，同工同酬权、养老权、疾病和失业的协助权，没有找到一个地位而被认为是国家宪法所保护的基本权利。可是基本权利的条文中，有一条在立法和宪法上对大资产阶级的财产和特权给以保护，说是除了付给足够的补偿以外，属于任何人或公司的财产，均不得接收以供公家之用，这样，阻止了通过宪法的保证来使工业（包括外国厂家）国有化的一切计划。
    八月十五日以来，所谓国民政府一直执行着印度资产阶级的计划，来反对工业国有化，压迫工人，加重工人的工作，并且以停止工资物价上升为借口，冻结工资。
    它在无情地压迫一切农民运动，使地主们完全满足。甚至它的趑趄不前的农业改革建议案中，也规定给地主们以丰富的补偿，对耕者有其田一节，却并不规定。他们在不同的形式之下保存地主制度。拟议中的农业立法，是分裂农民运动，扩大目前资产阶级政府基础的一个企图。
    在中央政府领导之下的各省政府，通过了一些公安法，那些法令被随便利用来对付工农和学生的民主运动。
    所谓国民政府正在粉碎各土邦人民反对王公秩序的斗争，并压迫各土邦内的农民斗争。它正在救援王公制度，并且夸张若干土邦加入印度的事实，说成是民众巨大的胜利，这样来转移人民对于民主斗争的注意力。
    对少数民族方面，它采取着民族歧视政策，压迫少数民族已变成了一个故意的政策。巴德尔（印政府现任副总理——译者）的赞美ＲＳＳ（法西斯流氓帮会组织——译者）以及和印度教大乘会的联盟证明了这一点，在所谓国民政府中，民族歧视主义是这样地强固有力，甚至在甘地被ＲＳＳ党徒暗杀之后，不管平民的反对民族歧视的激动的愤怒，对ＲＳＳ党徒的逮捕和禁令只有做一做样子而已。“国民政府”非但没有真正地压迫民族歧视的团体，反而利用这机会来压迫共产党。
    据尼赫鲁自己的声明：“国民政府”的这些民族歧视和其他反动政策，并没有在内阁中引起任何分歧，用尼赫鲁自己的话说，并无政治上的分歧，只有“脾气”上的分歧。
    尼赫鲁和帝国主义合作
    尼赫鲁政府实行的政策，是和英美帝国主义合作的政策。英美帝国主义者们正在和“国民政府”签订“协定”，以取得印度的战略地位，“国民政府”已同意不歧视外国资本而加以鼓励，不使工业国有化，不收未经英美同意的关税、共同组织公司来剥削印度人民。这个政策在逻辑上表示印度不能充分工业化，只能发展适合于英美资本家利益的某些工业。
    尼赫鲁政府的外交政策，表明了同样的合作。
    一开始，潘地德·尼赫鲁就采取结成一条所谓第三集团的路线——这路线代表大资产的利益，同时使印度站在反帝国主义和民主的阵营之外。在反帝民主阵营和美帝国主义领导的帝国主义阵营之间，进行着生死斗争的时候，尼赫鲁拒绝站在前一个阵营内，而装出中立的姿态。这个在侵略者和非侵略者之间，战争贩子和爱好和平者之间，扩张主义者和爱好自由的阵营之间的所谓中立，仅仅是一个掩盖其和英美帝国主义者合作的假面具罢了。最近数月来，尼赫鲁政府外交政策“中立”的假面具已经揭穿，在一切决定性的问题上，联合国的印度代表团采取着反民主和亲帝国主义的立场。它投票赞成搅出来麻痹联合国内部民主势力的“小型联大”，它投票反对外国军队立即自朝鲜撤退，对于乌克兰在安全理事会的代表权这问题，它让自己被美帝国主义所利用。
    特别是对于亚洲各民族十分紧要的问题，对于美国支持的反对中国人民的战争，以及法国在越南的殖民地战争这两问题，它保持沉默，并且拒绝行动；日本和约的问题也是这样，它实际上和英美帝国主义站在一条阵线上。关于反对印尼人民的，美国在背后支撑着的荷兰与印尼的战争，它赞同出卖印尼的自由斗争，这出卖是由最近的和约所完成，是美国发起和支配的调解委员会搅起来的，是杜鲁门总统所欢迎的。
    英帝国主义者们正在作公开的暗示，说起一个包括他们海外帝国在内的反苏集团。和这同时，消息传来，东南亚各国，包括印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸和锡兰，将成立一个和英国一致的同盟。也有一些消息说起，英国要派军事代表团到印度来。使印度的国防组织完善。
    这表示代表印度资产阶级的“国民政府”，正在把印度拖入反苏和反民主的集团，拖入美帝国和英帝国在东方的国防计划中。
    战后发展的特点
    印度战后政治中发生的大变化，是这一显著的真理，即印度资产阶级，或换句话说，代表资产阶级的国民大会党领导机构，已经放弃了它的反帝任务，变成了合作主义者，因此就是反动者。
    两个重大的事实决定了这条道路。
    第一、日益增涨的革命高潮，已使印度资产阶级惧怕群众。它已再不能够以群众运动作赌本，来从帝国主义那里获得让步了。
    第二、看到印度市场由于经济危机而日益萎缩，印度资产阶级本身需要国外市场，可是运动对于国外市场的依靠，无异就是对于英美的殖民地和半殖民地的依靠。这使英美能够在允许它接近这些市场以前逼它接受任何条件。这种合作的经济基础，是在战争时期就按放下来的。
    第一、在战争期间，印度资产阶级赚获了异常巨大的利润，是变富了。
    流动资本的日益增涨的积聚，使印度资产阶级向各方面设法投资。
    第二、在资本主义世界中，英美帝国主义者们，拥有印度资产阶级非常急迫需要的资本货物的垄断权，为了获得这些货物，印度资产阶级准备在任何方面都讨好英美帝国主义者，并且接受任何条件。
    这种合作的经济基础，被战后资本主义的危机进一步加强了，这危机是由于资本的部分累积，由于新民主主义诸国内资本主义市场的丧失，由于生产危机以及与此同时并进的卖不掉的存货的过分堆积，以及最后由于“生产过多”及物价狂跌的世界规模危机的新威胁。全世界劳动人民，用革命的方法来解决这危机的决心，正在驱使一切反动力量形成一个阵营，不管在危机的过程中，它们互相之间有利益上的冲突。
