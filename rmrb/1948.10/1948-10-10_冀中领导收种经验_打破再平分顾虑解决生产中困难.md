Jizhong Leaders Gather Planting Experience
    Breaking Down Concerns About Redistribution, Resolving Difficulties in Production
    [Jizhong Electric] Jizhong areas have gained initial experience in leading the autumn harvest and wheat planting work:
    (1) Timely elimination of ideological concerns among the masses, breaking down various production obstacles. After deploying the autumn harvest and wheat planting work, various localities discovered that many ideological concerns and obstacles existed among the masses. In areas where land reform had been implemented, some people worried about redistribution because land rights had not yet been determined. In some villages, the correction of excesses was incomplete, affecting the production enthusiasm of the masses. After poor peasants were allocated land, they felt uneasy planting it because they had not received land certificates. Some landlords and rich peasants feared "re-examination" and feared that poor peasants would exchange land. In addition, some people worried that planting more wheat would lead to heavy burdens. Other villages had disorganized organizations, and village cadres were not actively leading production; some villages had chaotic substitute farming, with people who should not be substitute farming doing so, increasing the burden on the masses; some villages could not effectively solve the actual difficulties of military dependents; some poor peasants lacked production tools and seeds, while landlords and rich peasants lacked the means of production; and some villages had refugees returning from KMT-controlled areas who needed resettlement. Most localities paid attention to solving the above-mentioned concerns and practical difficulties in a timely manner. The administrative office, according to the instructions of the North China government, issued a proclamation on the issuance of land certificates. Some counties issued land certificates in key areas, and villages where land reform had been thoroughly carried out but certificates had not been issued also announced that there would be no more redistribution, repeatedly publicizing our burden policy and the administrative office's seven measures for rewarding production. In addition, the practical difficulties in production of all classes were resolved. Promoting societies and banks to lend seeds and loans to help households lacking seeds solve their difficulties; explaining to middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against in the land reform and had been corrected, and encouraging them to become rich; providing appropriate compensation to those who had not been corrected; appropriately resettling landlords and rich peasants who had not been allocated means of production and households returning from KMT-controlled areas. Some villages with disorganized village organizations and chaotic substitute farming were also rectified. After in-depth propaganda and resolution of practical problems, the production enthusiasm of all classes gradually stabilized.
    　　　　Participate in Production, Lead Production, Pay Attention to Cherishing the Time of the Masses
    (2) Many county and district cadres have adopted the method of leading production by participating in production, making the leadership of production work gradually deepened. Most district cadres in An'guo District, after arriving in the villages, worked with the masses during the day to understand the situation. The work team of Bafang Village planned to distribute meals and production tasks to village cadres and the masses, which was very popular with the masses. Cadres in the district also paid attention to cherishing the time of the masses, holding meetings at night, generally not exceeding half-past two.
    (3) The backbone and leading role of Party members and activists was brought into play, driving the production of the masses. Party members and cadres in Nan Da Wang Village, Jianguo, initially believed that mass production did not need leadership, fearing that it would delay their own work in the fields. After the district cadres explained, the Party members and cadres actively engaged in production, setting an example for the masses; and divided into four groups to publicize and explain to the masses, dispelling their ideological concerns. Under the active publicity and organization of Party members and cadres, twenty households spontaneously organized six mutual aid groups.
    (4) Educate the masses with facts, and use key points to drive the general. In Zhujia Xiezhuang, Shen County, there was never a habit of soaking seeds. Although the county work team repeatedly publicized the benefits of warm water soaking, many people had no confidence. The work team buried seeds soaked in warm water from Zhu Lianyou's house in the eggplant field. The next morning, sprouts appeared, and they immediately used the facts to publicize to the masses, and the masses gained confidence. When Wangjiazhuang, Jin County, organized labor mutual aid, the old mutual aid groups were convened, and the heads of the farmers' association groups participated. People from the mutual aid groups reported the benefits of mutual aid, and then the farmers' association group leaders returned to the group to publicize, so that the masses knew the benefits of small mutual aid groups, and they found partners and formed teams, resulting in the organization of ten more groups.
    In short, production leadership must be based on the needs of the masses and overcome formalistic leadership methods. For example, when organizing labor mutual aid, attention should be paid to not having too many people, not being formal, and letting people join or leave as they wish. In addition, attention must be paid to gradually transforming and improving from the old foundation.

### 冀中领导收种经验　打破再平分顾虑解决生产中困难

　　冀中领导收种经验
    打破再平分顾虑解决生产中困难
    【冀中电】冀中各地在领导秋收种麦工作中，获得初步经验：
    （一）及时消除群众思想顾虑，打破各种生产障碍。各地在布置了秋收种麦工作后，发现群众中不少思想顾虑和障碍：在已实行土改的地区，因地权还未确定，部分群众顾虑再平分。有的村纠偏不彻底，影响了群众的生产情绪。贫农分得土地后，因没发土地证种着也觉不踏实。有的地主富农怕“复查”，怕贫农换地。另有群众顾虑种麦多了负担重。还有的村组织混乱，村干部不积极领导生产；有的村代耕混乱，不该代耕的也代耕，加重了群众负担；有的则对军属实际困难不能很好解决；有的贫农缺乏生产工具、种子等，地主富农缺乏生产资料；还有些村从蒋区回来了一些难民需要安置等。对于上述各种顾虑和实际困难，各地大部都注意了及时解决。行署根据华北政府指示，颁发了发土地证的布告，有的县并有重点的颁发了土地证，没发的土改已彻底的村庄，也宣布不再平分，反复宣传我之负担政策及行署奖励生产的七项办法。此外，并解决了各阶层生产中的实际困难。推进社、银行贷种、贷款，帮助缺乏种子的户解决困难，对土改中错斗的中农已纠正的给予解释，鼓励他发家致富；未纠正的作了适当补偿；对没分得生产资料的地富及从蒋区回来的户，作了适当的安置。村组织及代耕混乱的，有的也作了整顿。经过深入宣传并解决实际问题后，各阶层生产情绪逐渐稳定。
    　　　　参加生产领导生产　注意珍惜群众时间
    （二）不少县区干部，采用了以参加生产领导生产的方法，使生产工作的领导逐渐深入。安国一区大部区干部到村后，白天和群众一块生产，从中了解情况。八方村工作组吃饭生产都是有计划的分到村干部、群众中，颇得群众欢迎。该区干部并注意珍惜群众时间，开会都利用晚上，一般都不超过两点半钟。
    （三）发挥了党员、积极分子的骨干带头作用，带动了群众生产。建国南大王村党员、干部开始认为群众生产不用领导，怕耽误自己地里活，后经区干解释，党员、干部以积极生产，给群众作出样子；并分四片向群众宣传解释，解除群众思想顾虑。在党员干部积极宣传和组织下，二十户自动组织了六个互助组。
    （四）用事实教育群众，以重点带动一般。深县祝家斜庄，一贯没浸种习惯，虽然县工作组反复宣传温汤浸种的好处，但好多群众没信心，工作组便把祝连友家温汤浸过的种埋在茄子畦里，第二天上午生了芽，立时用事实向群众宣传，群众才有了信心。晋县王家庄组织劳动互助时，将旧有的互助组召集起来，农会各小组长参加，由互助组的人报告互助的好处，然后农会小组长回组作了宣传，这样使群众都知道小型互助组的好处，纷纷找对象搭伙，结果又组织了十个组。
    总之，生产领导必须根据群众的需要，克服形式主义的领导方法。如组织劳动互助时，应注意人家不要太多，不拘形式，愿合就合，愿散就散。另外，还必须注意从旧有的基础上逐步改造与提高。
