　　My View on New Yangko
　　Ma Yanxiang
　　Since coming to the liberated area, I have been extremely happy to see the New Yangko Opera, which I have long yearned for. With the emancipation of the peasants, peasant art has also been emancipated!
　　Yangko was originally a form of peasant drama, but in the past, it was a tool used by the exploiting classes to strengthen their ruling power, to anesthetize, deceive, and fool the masses. In it, the masses were clowns, slaves, who were forever ridiculed, satirized, and cursed on the stage, forever playing out the various tragedies of the world. But today's New Yangko is completely different. The masses not only no longer appear as clowns and slaves, but have become the protagonists of the plays. From the several plays I have seen, "Aunt Wang Goes to the Market," "Husband and Wife Learn to Read" (performed by the China University Cultural Troupe), "Emancipated Flower Drum," "Drought Prevention and Famine Preparedness," and "Returning to the Team" (performed by the People's Cultural Troupe), all fully demonstrate how happy and energetic the masses are living under the democratic government. In terms of form, although it is still based on the old Yangko form, it can be clearly seen that, in order to express the new mass life, thoughts, and feelings, the New Yangko has adopted and absorbed many elements of new drama forms that can express reality and are acceptable to the masses, breaking through the old Yangko form. This is a revolutionary work in the history of Chinese drama, and it is successful. If someone asks me about the achievements of drama in the liberated areas, without hesitation, I would recommend New Yangko.
　　The success of New Yangko is not only manifested in liberating Yangko itself and giving it a new life, but more importantly, I believe it provides concrete and clear answers to some of the questions that have been debated and doubted in the literary and art circles for many years. It proves the close relationship between all literary and artistic work and politics and economy: only on the basis of democratic politics and people's economy can literary and artistic work have the possibility of development; it proves that only from the perspective of the masses can literary and artistic work have the possibility of improvement and popularization; it proves that to complete the task of popularizing literature and art, there is no other way besides requiring literary and artistic workers to closely integrate with the masses in the practice of life and work, so that their thoughts and feelings are integrated with the masses (if it is drama, it naturally includes directors and actors). It further proves that the masses are by no means as conservative, backward, unable to accept new things, and lacking the ability to appreciate art as generally imagined; on the contrary, their lives are progressive, they are eager for new things, and they have noble artistic tastes and a realistic artistic viewpoint. These facts have made us more deeply aware of the correct path of artistic creation, and thus realized how we should arrange our lives so that our art can truly serve the people. As someone who has just arrived in the liberated area, seeing these commendable achievements made by the artists in the liberated area, I feel truly ashamed.
　　There is no doubt that New Yangko has already established its foundation among the masses and will be further developed and carried forward. Although there are still some issues that need to be studied, such as whether the content can be more diversified? Can the handling of themes be more diverse? In terms of form, does the music part still lack variety? Generally speaking, it seems to be biased towards lyricism and difficult to express more magnificent and vigorous emotions. In the action (dance) part, in addition to the general rhythm, can the special life actions of different classes of people also be rhythmized and become beautiful dances? However, I believe that these problems will definitely be gradually resolved in the continuous development of New Yangko. Here, there is only one question, a basic question of Yangko, that must be clearly stipulated, that is: should Yangko opera focus on "song" or should it focus on "speech"? In the fifty-odd Yangko operas that I have read, many New Yangko operas seem to focus on "speech." In some entire plays, except for one or two sections of song, almost all the plot is expressed in "speech." This phenomenon, I think, may be because the comrades who created Yangko in the past were mostly engaged in spoken drama and were particularly familiar with the spoken drama form, so they naturally adopted more of the techniques of spoken drama? However, from the perspective of the mass nature of Yangko opera and its performance conditions, I believe that its "song" element should be maintained as much as possible. Originally, the initial form of all drama was expressed in song, and it was relatively simple and pure. Precisely because it is simple and pure, it is easy to learn, easy to spread, and easy to popularize; and precisely because of this, it is rich in mass character. The increase of "speech" in drama from "song," according to my understanding, began after the drama developed from the countryside to the city, and from the square to the theater. Because in rural performances, the audience and actors are all local people, and there is no barrier in dialects and accents, so even singing can be understood. But once in the city, the audience has greater mobility, and dialects and accents are restricted. In order to make it easier for the audience to understand the plot, "speech" was added in addition to "song." The "song" and "speech" in all old-fashioned dramas mostly repeat the same plot, which shows that the role of "speech" is entirely to supplement the lack of singing. Secondly, in square performances, the sound of speech cannot be transmitted as far as singing. But in the theater, the performance area is reduced, and the sound of speech can also be clearly heard by the audience, so the amount of speech gradually increased. Today, the main activity area of our New Yangko is still in the countryside, and it still lacks the conditions of urban theaters. If there is too much speech, will it affect the effect of the drama performance? This is a question worth studying.
　　I heard that there have been no less than a thousand Yangko creations in recent years, which is truly a rich treasure trove. However, in the past month, the various printed and copied Yangko operas that I have obtained with my best efforts are only more than fifty kinds. I think someone should specialize in this collection work, compiling and printing all the New Yangko operas of the past few years, no matter what their content is. This will be the most valuable material for writing the history of the Chinese drama movement in the future.

### 我看新秧歌

　　我看新秧歌
    马彦祥
    来解放区以后，使我十分高兴的是看到了向往已久的新秧歌剧。随着农民的翻身，农民的艺术也翻了身了！
    秧歌本是一种农民的戏剧，过去是被剥削阶级为了加强他们的统治力量，用以麻醉、欺骗、愚弄群众的工具，在这里面，群众是小丑、是奴才，他们在舞台上永远被讥笑、被讽刺、被咒诅，永远扮演着人间的各种悲剧；但是今天的新秧歌完全不同了，群众不但不再以小丑和奴才的姿态登场，而且都已成了剧本的主人公。就我所看到的“王大娘赶集”、“夫妻识字”（华大文工团演出）、“翻身花鼓”、“防旱备荒”和“归队”（人民文工团演出）几个剧来说，都充分地表现出了群众在民主政权下生活得是那样的愉快而有生气。在形式方面，虽然还是以旧秧歌的形式为基础，但可以明显地看出，为了表现新的群众生活、思想和感情，在新秧歌里已经采取了吸收了许多足以表现现实而又能为群众所接受的新戏剧形式的要素，把旧秧歌的形式给突破了。这是中国戏剧史上的一件革命工作，而且是成功的。如果有人问我解放区的戏剧成就，毫无犹豫地，我要推荐新秧歌。
    新秧歌的成功不仅表现在解放了秧歌本身，赋予了它以新的生命；更重要的意义，我以为是对于若干年来文艺界所争论所怀疑的一些问题作了具体而明确的解答，它证明了一切文艺工作和政治经济的密切关系：只有在民主政治和人民经济的基础上，文艺工作才有发展的可能；它证明了只有从群众的观点出发，文艺工作才有提高和普及的可能；它证明了要完成文艺大众化的任务，除了要求文艺工作者在生活和工作的实践中和群众紧密地结合在一起，使得自己的思想情感和群众的溶合为一之外，更无其他的道路（如果是演剧，自然还包括了导演和演员）。它更证明了群众决不是如一般人所想象的那样保守、落后，不能接受新事物，没有欣赏艺术能力的；相反地，他们的生活是进取的，是迫切要求新的事物的，是具有高尚的艺术趣味和现实主义的艺术观点的。这一些事实使我们更深地认识了艺术创造的正确道路，从而领悟到应该如何安排自己的生活才能使自己的艺术做到真正为人民服务的地步。对于一个初到解放区的我，眼看着解放区的艺术家们做出的这些值得夸耀的成绩，自己觉得真是太惭愧了。
    新秧歌已经在群众中间建立起它的基础，而且更将发扬光大是无可怀疑的。虽然目前还存在着若干有待研讨的问题，诸如内容方面是不是还可以多样化一点？主题的处理还可以多方面一点？形式方面，音乐部分是不是还嫌缺少变化？一般的说，似乎是偏重于抒情的而难于表现比较雄壮刚健的情绪，动作（舞蹈）部分，除了一般的节奏之外，是不是还可以把不同阶层的群众的特殊生活动作也节奏化起来而成为优美的舞？但是这些问题，我相信在新秧歌的继续不断的发展过程当中是一定会得到逐步的解决的。这里，只有一个问题，一个秧歌的基本问题，必须予以明确的规定，就是：秧歌剧究竟是不是应该以“歌”为主，还是应该以“白”为主？就我所读到的五十几本秧歌剧来说，不少新秧歌似乎是偏重于“白”的。有的全剧中除了一二段歌之外，几乎全部是用“白”来表示剧情。这一现象，我想或者是由于创作秧歌的同志们过去大都是从事话剧的，对于话剧形式特别熟练，因而很自然地较多采用了话剧的手法吧？但是从秧歌剧的群众性的本质和它的演出条件来说，我以为应该尽量保持它的“歌”的要素。本来一切戏剧的最初形式都是用歌唱来表达的，而且都是比较简单纯朴的。唯其简单纯朴，所以容易学习，容易传诵，容易普遍化；也正因此，它才富于群众性。戏剧中由“歌”进而增加“白”，据我的理解，是戏剧从农村发展到城市，从广场发展到剧场之后才开始的。因为在农村演出，观众和演员都是本乡本土人，方言方音没有隔阂，虽是歌唱也能听懂。但一到了城市里，观众流动性较大，方言方音受了限制，为了使观众便于了解剧情起见，于是于“歌”之外，又加上了“白”。一切旧形式戏剧中的“歌”与“白”，大都是重复地说明同一个情节，即可见“白”的作用完全是为了补助歌唱的不足的。其次，在广场演出，说白的声音不如歌唱比较能传达得远。但到了剧场里，表演区缩小了，说白的声音也能使观众听得清楚了，于是说白便逐渐多了起来。今天我们的新秧歌的活动区域，主要还是在农村里面，它还缺少城市剧场的条件，如果说白过多了，是不是会影响到戏剧演出的效果？这是一个值得研究的问题。
    听说几年来的秧歌创作不下千余本，这真是一个丰富的宝库。但一个月来，尽我的最大努力所得到的各种印本和抄本的秧歌，不过五十余种。我觉得应该有人专门从事这一搜集工作，把几年来所有的新秧歌剧作，不论其是什么内容的，都汇编起来予以刊印，这将是将来写中国戏剧运动史的最珍贵的资料。
