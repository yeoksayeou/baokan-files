　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 24th: Revolutionary order has been rapidly established in Changchun City, and the Military Control Commission is actively carrying out various restoration works. The Garrison Headquarters is responsible for the city's defense and maintaining social order. The headquarters has deployed sentries to protect warehouses, factories, cultural institutions, and public buildings within the city. At the same time, it is conducting operations to search for armed saboteurs, collect Kuomintang stragglers, and clear landmines. The Political Department has issued an announcement to reassure the people and has dispatched cadres to various districts to express condolences to the citizens and investigate the disaster situation. The Municipal Office has begun relief and resettlement work, as well as municipal administration. Traffic to the suburbs has been restored, and food, coal, vegetables, and other supplies are flowing into the city. The power industry is also being actively repaired.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th: After the liberation of Jinzhou, Mayor Shi Lide of the democratic government, Secretary Hu Xikui of the Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Garrison Commander Zhou Jiajiang led party, government, and military personnel into the city to establish revolutionary order, maintain public security, and carry out various tasks. They issued an announcement to reassure the people, announced specific provisions of the city's policies, and called on the people of the city to work together to build a new Jinzhou.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 24th: Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Northeast "Suppression Headquarters," who surrendered with his troops in Changchun, has now arrived in Harbin. The Kuomintang Central News Agency, in a state of panic due to the uprising of Zeng Zesheng and the surrender of Zheng Dongguo, has been spreading a series of rumors since the 19th to stabilize its demoralized military. These rumors initially claimed that Zeng Zesheng was "captured" and that Zheng Dongguo led the New 7th Army in "fierce fighting" within the city. Later, they said, "Zeng Zesheng launched a surprise attack, and Li's army was annihilated," but Zheng Dongguo was still "fighting fiercely all day" on the 19th. Subsequently, they stated that on the morning of the 22nd, "the fierce fighting is still ongoing, and although the defending troops have suffered heavy casualties, their morale is still high." However, by the 23rd, they announced that Zheng Dongguo "finally fired his last bullet on the morning of the 21st and made a heroic sacrifice, and all 300 officers and soldiers under his command also died in the line of duty." The Kuomintang had spread similar rumors about the capture of Kang Ze and Wang Yaowu, but this time it was the worst, because Changchun had been occupied by the People's Liberation Army since the 17th, and Zheng Dongguo's troops had completed their collective surrender on the 19th without firing a single shot. In its editorial "On the Defense of Changchun" on the 22nd, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department said that the Kuomintang had "only admiration and reverence" for Zheng Dongguo's troops. Now, this Zheng Dongguo, who was admired and revered by the Kuomintang, has arrived in Harbin.

　　长春锦州建立革命秩序
  　郑洞国已抵哈蒋匪造谣说他“成仁”
    【新华社长春二十四日电】长春市革命秩序已迅速建立，军事管制委员会正积极进行各项恢复工作。卫戍司令部担负本市防卫及维护社会秩序的责任。该部对市内仓库、工厂、文化机关、公共建筑、均布有岗哨保护。同时进行搜捕武装破坏分子，收容国民党散兵与清扫地雷等工作。政治部已布告安民，并已派干部前赴各区慰问市民，调查灾情。市政办事处则已着手善后救济与安抚事宜，并整理市政。现市郊交通已恢复，粮食、煤、菜等正源源入城，电业亦正积极修复中。
    【新华社锦州二十四日电】锦州解放后，民主政府市长史立德、中共市委书记胡锡奎、卫戍司令周家姜率领党政军工作人员随即入城，进行建立革命秩序、维持治安等各项工作，并布告安民，宣布城市政策的各项具体规定，号召全市人民共同协力建设新锦州。
    【新华社哈尔滨二十四日电】在长春率部投降的国民党东北“剿总”副总司令郑洞国，现已抵哈尔滨。因曾泽生起义、郑洞国投降而狼狈不堪的国民党中央社，为了稳定其慌乱的军心，从十九日起造了一连串的谣言。这些谣言首先说曾泽生“被俘”，郑洞国率新七军在市内“鏖战”。随后说：“曾泽生突击、李军覆灭”，但郑洞国十九日还在“竟日激战”。随后又说二十二日晨“激战仍进行中，守军伤亡虽多，士气仍旺”。但是到了二十三日，又宣布郑洞国“终于二十一日上午发出最后之一弹，壮烈成仁，所属三百官兵亦全体殉职”。国民党对于康泽和王耀武的被俘，曾经造过同样的谣言，但是这一次最为糟糕，因为长春从十七日起即由解放军进驻，十九日郑洞国部即集体缴械完毕，没有打过一枪。国民党中宣部在二十二日“论长春之守”的社论中，说国民党对于郑洞国部“只有企仰、只有钦服”。现在这个被国民党所企仰钦服的郑洞国已经来到哈尔滨了。
