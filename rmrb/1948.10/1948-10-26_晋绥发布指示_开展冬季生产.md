　　Jin-Sui Issues Instructions
　　Launch Winter Production
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 17th】 Autumn harvesting and planting have been largely completed throughout Jin-Sui. In order to vigorously restore and develop various industries, mines, workshops, transportation, and various sideline occupations in the newly liberated areas of southern Jin, and to earnestly prepare for large-scale production next year, the Administrative Office has issued instructions on winter production. The instructions pointed out that all localities must widely publicize and conscientiously implement various policies and regulations related to production incentives. In areas where land reform has been completed, land certificates should be filled out and issued to determine land ownership and eliminate farmers' concerns about developing production. In areas where land reform has not been carried out or land ownership is temporarily difficult to determine, it should be announced that "whoever cultivates it, harvests it," to encourage the masses to expand their operations. All localities should formulate plans for developing production based on the current situation, and overcome blindness and laissez-faire in production leadership. As for the difficulties in production, it is necessary to fully organize and utilize the existing manpower, animal power, financial resources, and materials of the masses. The solution is to promote and develop private credit lending, give play to the role of private floating capital, and overcome the masses' idea of simply relying on government loans. The instructions continued with the following specific winter production tasks: 1. Widely carry out the manure accumulation movement. Organize the masses to accumulate more manure and compost, open oil presses, flour mills, and tofu workshops, and raise more pigs and sheep. The Industry and Commerce Bureau must systematically provide loans and orders to iron and wood workers to manufacture agricultural tools, supply areas lacking agricultural tools, and mobilize farmers to store fuel. 2. Vigorously build water conservancy projects. Help the masses restore, build, or expand canals and wells, resolve water disputes, and start construction early. All localities must formulate water conservancy development plans, complete the surveying and investigation of larger canals, and prepare materials and organize manpower for construction in the coming spring. 3. Restore and develop the coal industry. Currently, the focus is on restoring and consolidating old kilns, supplemented by establishing new kilns. Mobilize farmers to jointly restore coal kilns during the winter slack season. 4. Based on the specific conditions of each locality, restore and develop various handicrafts workshops and sideline production. Organize the manufacture of agricultural tools, waterwheels, textile machines, as well as papermaking, ceramics, weaving mats, etc., and organize the masses to cooperate and expand production. 5. Develop textiles. In developed textile areas, focus on promoting sales and improving quality; in underdeveloped areas, implement the principle of self-spinning and self-weaving. 6. Develop transportation. Organize manpower and animal power for winter slack season transportation, exchange materials, and increase people's income. At the same time, strict attendance systems should be implemented, and a military-civilian contracting system should be trialed to save manpower and use it for production.
