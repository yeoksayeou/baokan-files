　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Two publications in Peiping and Shanghai similarly used facts in late September to prove how the Kuomintang, over the past ten years and more, has used currency magic to turn the people's wealth into one 240 millionth of its original value. Huang Yanpei's "Autumn News" in the third volume, eighth issue of the Peiping Zhongjian Bi-Monthly stated: "A cultural organization in Shanghai received a donation of 500,000 silver dollars fifteen years ago from an enthusiastic individual, stipulating that it be deposited in eight banks, using only the interest and not touching the principal, which was followed scrupulously. Soon after, the legal tender policy was implemented, merging into 500,000 legal tender dollars. When Shanghai fell to the enemy, legal tender was exchanged at two to one for puppet currency, merging into 250,000 puppet currency dollars. After the victory, puppet currency was exchanged at two hundred to one for legal tender, merging into 1,250 legal tender dollars. When the Gold Yuan Certificate was issued, legal tender was exchanged at three million to one for Gold Yuan Certificates, merging into 0.41 Gold Yuan Certificate cents. Gold Yuan Certificates were exchanged at two to one for silver dollars, merging into 0.205 *hu* (Reporter's note: the last two numbers in the original were miscalculated as 0.041 cents and 0.0205 *si*). Over fifteen years, after going around in a big circle, 500,000 dollars became almost zero, a big joke." According to the same history, a reader's letter in the fifth volume, fifth issue of the Shanghai Observation Weekly used calculations to prove that 30 million silver dollars in the 24th year of the Republic of China had become "only 0.0125 today, not even enough to buy a sesame cake." In addition, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on September 25th carried a special dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th, stating: "Wang Shaoming of Liuhe deposited 2,000 silver dollars in the Zhongnan Bank in the 20th year of the Republic of China. On the 23rd, he went to collect the principal and interest, receiving a total of 0.33 Gold Yuan Certificates. Wang went mad and shouted, running to the residence of a certain legislator, crying and begging for a solution." According to the exchange rate, 0.33 Gold Yuan Certificates is equivalent to 0.165 silver dollars, a figure that is the sum of principal and interest and is therefore larger than the two results mentioned above.

　　国民党的“币改”魔术
    十五年前的五十万块银元十五年后变得几乎等于零
    【新华社陕北十三日电】北平和上海的两个刊物，在九月下旬同样用事实证明了国民党十多年来如何用货币的魔术，把人民的财富化为原值廿四万万分之一。北平中建半月刊三卷八期黄炎培“秋讯”一文称：“上海有一个文化机关，十五年前，得一位热心家捐了银元五十万元，约定存入八家银行，只用息，不动本，规规矩矩地照办。一会儿法币政策实行了，合成法币五十万元，上海陷敌了，法币二对伪币一，合成伪币廿五万元。胜利了伪币二百对法币一，合成法币一千二百五十元。金圆券颁行了，法币三百万对金圆券一，合成金圆券四毫一丝。金圆券二对银元一，合成银元二毫零五忽（记者注：原文末两数误计为四厘一毫和二厘零五丝）。十五年间，绕了一个大圈子，五十万元几几乎等于零，闹一个大笑话。”上海观察周刊五卷五期读者投书根据同一历史，用算式证明民国廿四年的三千万块银元，到了十三年后的今天，“便只有一分二厘五毫了，连买一个烧饼都不够”。此外，九月二十五日天津大公报载该报南京廿四日专电称：“六合人王绍铭，于民国二十年以银元二千元存入中南银行，二十三日往领取本息共得金圆三角三分。王发狂大喊，跑到某立委寓所，痛哭请求代为解决。”按金圆券三角三分合银元一角六分五厘，此数系本利之和，故尚较上述两种结果为大。
