　　Correctly Grasping the Labor-Capital Benefit Policy
    Xinji Corrects the Error of Excessively Conciliating Capitalists
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Xinji trade union cadres made biased errors in handling labor-capital relations and worker welfare issues. After in-depth inspection, these errors are being gradually corrected. In late June, Wang Bingchun, the manager of the Tongxinhao Whip Shop in the city (previously mistakenly reported as Tongchunhao), mistreated worker Ma Danwu, only allowing him to drink water and eat biscuits, but not allowing him to eat meals. Ma said, "If you don't give me food, just let me drink water, I can't do it, I quit." Wang said, "You can't quit, you have to keep working even if you die." And he picked up a sheep-herding whip to hit the worker. He was stopped by a neighbor. Ma Danwu went to the industry trade union cadre, saying he wanted to quit and settle his wages. When he started work in the first lunar month, the labor and capital sides freely agreed on a wage of two hundred whip handles for the whole year (the whip industry in the city uses in-kind wages, with whip handles as finished products valued at a price), half a year should get one hundred handles, the market price is 10,000 yuan per handle, totaling 1,000,000 yuan. But Wang insisted on "not giving even one" with the excuse of "not having finished the year." When Ma went to ask for the money, he was pushed out with a skinning knife. Ma then went to the city trade union and asked for a resolution. City trade union cadres Ma Quanfu and Kang Tingshen onesidedly accepted the Hebei-Central General Trade Union's review of "past labor movements committing leftist adventurist errors." Without research from the city trade union, they jointly decided with the Federation of Industry and Commerce on a resolution of "only taking care of the interests of industrialists and businessmen, not taking care of the interests of workers." They criticized Wang Bingchun face-to-face, which was right, but only let him pay 150,000 yuan in wages. The workers did not agree with this resolution. The city trade union and industry trade union cadres went to "persuade" him, forcing him to accept it. Finally, the worker said, "For the sake of the trade union, let's just forget about it!" Former Xinji City Committee Secretary Wang Nong and city trade union cadre Wang Yingcai discovered the error in handling this issue from the information gathered by the industrial trade union. After listening to the transmission of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, city trade union cadres recognized that they had committed a principled error in handling this issue, only mistakenly protecting the interests of industrialists and businessmen, and actually infringing upon the interests of workers. They immediately conducted a review at the cadre meeting and reported to the city committee. The city committee agreed to resolve the issue again. They had first fully prepared at the industry trade union and industry manager meetings. Ma Danwu also went to the industry trade union and requested a new resolution. On September 18th, a meeting of trade union and industry trade union cadres was held, attended by the mayor and the director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau. The deputy director of the trade union introduced the facts of Wang Bingchun's mistreatment of workers and reviewed the trade union's improper initial handling. He explained that the workers had raised objections and requested a new resolution. Based on the research results of various industries and the opinions of the city's leading organs, it was decided that the workers' wages should be paid in full, and Wang Bingchun should apologize to the mistreated worker. Both sides agreed, and the problem was resolved satisfactorily. The reason for the occurrence of this phenomenon, from the trade union cadres' perspective, was due to the one-sided acceptance of the Hebei-Central General Trade Union's review of the labor movement, believing that "industry and commerce cannot develop due to wage disputes." At the merchants, managers, and worker representatives' conference to convey the resolutions of the Hebei-Central Industry Conference and review past labor movement biases, City Trade Union Director Zhang Zhongnian even saluted and apologized to managers of various industries, "representing the workers to admit mistakes to the capitalists." When the city committee implemented the spirit of the Hebei-Central Industry and Commerce Conference, in order to develop industry and commerce, it also one-sidedly emphasized taking care of the interests of industrialists and businessmen, disregarding the principle of benefiting both labor and capital. At the merchant, manager, and worker representatives' conference, he did not correctly explain policy principles, only saying: "If the factory exists, the workers will have food to eat. This is temporarily subordinating interests to long-term interests." On the issue of wages, the city committee only mentioned "mutual consent," but did not mention ensuring workers' appropriate living standards. It proposed to the workers "studying is for progress and awareness, greatly increasing production. Production is for supporting the front and liberating ourselves." But it did not mention issues such as establishing the responsibilities of industrialists and businessmen in normal labor-capital relations and ensuring workers' welfare is not harmed. Opposing excessively left labor conditions and implementing a policy of benefiting both labor and capital is completely correct. But ignoring the interests of workers, harming the normal interests of workers, and blindly accommodating capitalists is capitulationism, which must be opposed. Former City Committee Secretary Wang Nong returned to the city from a meeting of the North China Central Bureau, clarified the Party's industrial and commercial policies, discovered this problem, and immediately strictly helped the trade union make appropriate reviews and handling. This was completely correct.

### 正确掌握劳资两利方针　辛集纠正过分迁就资本家的错误

　　正确掌握劳资两利方针
    辛集纠正过分迁就资本家的错误
    【本报讯】辛集工会干部在处理劳资关系及工人福利问题上，发生偏向，经深入检查，正逐步纠正。六月下旬，该市同心号鞭梢铺（前误为同春号）经理王丙春虐待工人马耽误，只叫他喝水吃饼子，不让吃饭。马说：“不叫我吃饭，光叫我喝水，我干不了，不干了。”王说：你不干不行，死也得干。”并拿起放羊的鞭苗子，要打工人。被邻居劝止。马耽误找到行业工会干部，提出不想干了，要算工资。在阴历正月上工时，劳资双方曾自由约定工资全年二百把鞭梢（该市鞭梢业均实物工资，以鞭梢成品折价），半年应得一百把，市价每把万元，合一百万元。但王以“没干下一年”为词，坚持“一个也不给”。马去要钱，竟被以刮皮刀子推出。马乃找到市职工会要求解决。市工会干部马全福、康庭身两同志片面地接受了冀中总工会关于“过去工运犯了左倾冒险主义错误”的检讨，未经市工会研究，即与工商联合会共同决定“只照顾工商业者的利益，不照顾工人利益”的解决办法，当面批评了王丙春一顿，这是对的，但只让他出十五万元的工资，工人们不同意这样解决，市工会及行业工会干部去“说服”他，硬让他接受。最后工人说：“关着工会大伙的面子，就算了吧！”前辛集市委书记王农和市工会干部王英才两同志从工业工会汇集情况中，发觉这个问题处理错误。市工会干部听了华北工商会议的传达，认识到处理这个问题犯了原则错误，只错误地保护工商业家的利益，而实际侵犯了工人利益，即在干部会上作了检讨，并向市委作了报告，市委同意重新解决，事先曾在行业工会及行业经理会上，作了充分酝酿，马耽误也找到行业工会要求重新处理。九月十八日举行工会、行业工会干部会，市长、工商局长均参加，职工会副主任介绍王丙春虐待工人的事实，并检讨职工会第一次处理不当。说明工人提出了意见，要求重新处理。根据各行业研究结果及市领导机关的意见，决定工人应得工资须如数发给，王丙春应向被虐待者道歉。双方同意，问题至此即行圆满解决。这种现象发生的原因，从工会干部方面检查，是由于片面的接受了冀中总工会关于工运工作的检讨，认为“工商业不能发展，也是闹工资闹的。”市工会主任张中年在传达冀中工业会议决议和检讨过去工运偏向的商人经理工人代表大会上，对各业经理甚至敬礼道歉，“代表工人向资方承认错误。”市委在贯彻冀中工商会议的精神时，为了发展工商业，也曾片面的强调了照顾工商业者的利益。无视劳资两利原则。在商人经理工人代表大会上他不正确解释政策原则，只说：“工厂存在，工人就有饭吃。这是暂时利益服从远大利益。”在工资问题上，市委只提“双方自愿”，却未提保障工人的适当生活水平。对工人提出“学习是为了进步觉悟，大量提高生产。生产是为了支前，解放自己”。但对于树立正常劳资关系中工商业者的责任和保障工人福利不受危害等问题，却没有提。反对过左的劳动条件，实行劳资两利的政策是完全正确的。但无视工人利益，损害工人正常利益而一味地去迁就资本家，则是投降主义，必须反对。前市委书记王农同志从华北中央局开会回市，明确了党的工商业政策，发现这一问题，立即严格地帮助工会作了适当的检讨处理。是完全正确的。
