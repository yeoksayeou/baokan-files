　　【Taiyue Telegram】With the autumn harvest and planting season beginning, it is the perfect time for seed selection. The Taiyue Second Farm dispatched a working group to Tumeng Village in Yangcheng First District to assist the masses with seed selection. In the past, Tumeng Village never paid attention to seed selection. Some would just pick some large seeds from the field and take them home, hanging them from the rafters to dry for use. Others would take seeds from the granary or urn, sift through them a bit, and then plant them. After the comrades from the Second Farm arrived in Tumeng Village, they first widely publicized the benefits of seed selection and the methods involved. Then, they organized experienced farmers to form a technical research group. On September 7th, they conducted field seed selection, selecting eight varieties of high-quality millet seeds, including Hongmiao, Caohui, and Gu. On the 9th, they held a seed exhibition to promote seed selection among everyone, introducing the advantages, disadvantages, and yields of each millet variety to the masses. Men and women from the entire village came to visit, breaking the superstitious beliefs held by a few, such as "do not plant millet in the year of the rat, do not plant hemp in the year of the pig." They guided everyone to evaluate seeds based on their own experience. Elder Wu Zhijin had been selecting seeds in the fields every year, so he was invited to introduce his seed selection experience to everyone. After everyone visited, evaluated, and compared, they unanimously agreed that the Hongmiao Caohui Gu seeds were good and wanted to exchange for this variety. The village is currently conducting field selection of high-quality varieties of corn, beans, and other crops.

　　太岳农场干部下乡深入一点推动选种
    【太岳电】秋收秋种开始，选种工作正是时候，太岳第二农场特派工作组到阳城一区土孟村帮助群众选种。土孟村过去对选种工作从不注意，有的就在场里拣些肥大的种子带回家去，吊在梁上风干使用；有的是在种的时候从囤里或瓮里取出，簸拣簸拣就去种上。第二农场同志到了土孟村后，先普遍宣传了选种的好处与选种的办法，随后又组织了有经验的农民成立技术研究组。于九月七日进行田间选种，选出优良谷种红苗草灰谷等八种，于九日召开种籽展览大会，以推动大家选种。把每种谷的优点缺点和产量介绍给群众。全村男女都来参观。打破了少数人的“子年不种谷、亥年不种麻”等迷信说法。引导大家根据自己经验实行评种。吴执金老汉年年在地选种，就请他把他选种的经验给大家介绍了一遍。大家参观评定比较以后，一致认为红苗草灰谷种籽好，都要换这种谷种。该村现正进行田间选玉茭、豆等优良品种。
