　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. British laboring people continue to oppose the Labor government's conscription measures and demand acceptance of the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals at the UN General Assembly. According to TASS, citing the London Daily Worker, on the 19th, a meeting convened by the mayor of Wallasey in Cheshire to promote conscription was attended by only sixty people. Veterans and trade union members who spoke at the meeting opposed military preparations for the benefit of US imperialism. After forty-five minutes, the mayor had to announce the adjournment. In the afternoon of the same day, a demonstration march appeared in front of the venue. The demonstrators held large banners with the words "Down with the warmongers" written on them. In Stockton in Durham County and Thornaby in Yorkshire, the trade union committees refused to support local conscription movements. In Belper and Ripley in Derbyshire, the trade union committees passed resolutions endorsing the Soviet Union's proposals for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic bombs at the UN General Assembly, praising them as a truly concrete contribution to the cause of peace and international security. According to Telepress, the Glasgow Trades Council, representing all trade unions in the Glasgow area, passed a resolution strongly condemning the government's rearmament and demanding an immediate ban on atomic weapons. Representatives of forty-four trade unions and cooperatives in Wandsworth, South London, also resolved to demand that the government accept the Soviet disarmament proposals.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS reports: In an international commentary, Pravda, refuting the statements made by US and British representatives in the Political and Security Committee of the UN General Assembly during the discussion of disarmament issues, stated that they talked incessantly about the tension in the international situation, but refused to agree to a ban on atomic weapons and disarmament. Creating international tension has become the most important factor in US and British foreign policy. Experience has shown that this approach of the US-British bloc is clearly used to solve the following problems: (1) Due to the election campaign, they need to stir up militarism and war mania in the United States. Leaders of the "bipartisan group" would consider improving international relations to be a fundamental disruption of their campaign strategy; (2) Behind the clamor of international tension, they hope to carry out their plan to divide Germany to the end; (3) Finally, they want to abandon the United Nations. Therefore, improving the international situation is completely out of the consideration of the US-British bloc.

　　英劳动人民反对募兵
  　要求接受苏裁军建议
  　真理报斥美英制造国际紧张形势
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】英国劳动人民继续反对工党政府的募兵措施，要求接受苏联在联大所提的裁军建议。据塔斯社引伦敦工人日报载称：十九日，在柴郡之瓦拉西城，市长为发动募兵而召开的会议，只有六十人到会。在会上演说的退伍军人和职工会会员，反对为美帝国主义利益来进行军事准备。四十五分钟后，市长不得不宣布闭会。同日下午，会场门前又出现了示威游行。示威者手持大幅长旗、上书“打倒战争贩子”。在多尔翰郡之斯托克吞及约克郡之索那柏城，工会委员会均拒绝支持当地的募兵运动，在德尔比郡之贝尔普及里普莱尔城，工会委员会通过决议，拥护苏联在联大所提的裁军和禁止原子弹的建议，誉之为对和平事业及国际安全的真正具体贡献。又据电通社称：代表格拉斯哥区所有工会的该区工会委员会，曾通过决议，严词斥责政府重整军备，并要求立即禁止原子武器。伦敦南部的万德渥斯亦有四十四个工会和合作社的代表，决议要求政府接受苏联裁军的建议。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：真理报国际评论于驳斥美英代表在联大政治安全委员会讨论裁军问题中的发言时称：他们口口声声谈到国际形势的紧张，但又拒绝同意禁止原子武器和裁军。制造国际紧张形势，已成为美英外交政策中最重要的因素。经验证明，美英集团这种路线显然是用来解决下面这些问题的：（一）由于竞选运动的关系，他们需要在美国煽起军国主义和战争狂。改善国际关系会被“两党集团”的领袖们认为是根本破坏他们的竞选策略；（二）在国际形势紧张的叫嚣后面，他们希望把分裂德国的计划实行到底；（三）最后，他们想要抛弃联合国。因此，改善国际形势完全不在美英集团的考虑之列。
