Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Front, Urgent Telegram, 22nd, 2400 hours: Our Central Plains People's Liberation Army occupied Zhengzhou today. The defending enemy fled north, and is being surrounded and annihilated by our army in the area north of Zhengzhou and south of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Zhengzhou is the intersection of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways and has always been a strategically important town. Due to the emergency in Xuzhou, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to transfer the three corps of Sun Yuanliang's group stationed in Zhengzhou (according to the Kuomintang army, starting in October, reorganized divisions were renamed corps, and reorganized brigades were renamed divisions) eastward. The defending soldiers in Zhengzhou were weak, and they desperately fled upon our army's arrival. Now Zhongmu County to the east of Zhengzhou and the Yellow River Bridge to the north have been cut off by our army, and the fleeing enemy will be quickly annihilated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: The CCP Central Committee sent a telegram of congratulations on the liberation of Zhengzhou. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Comrades Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and all comrades of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army: After the liberation of Jinan, Jinzhou, and Changchun, Zhengzhou has also been liberated. The pivotal point of the two major railways, Longhai and Pinghan, is now in our hands, which is extremely beneficial to the overall war situation. We send this special telegram to congratulate you.

		The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, October 23, 1948

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Front, 23rd: Zhengzhou is the most important transportation hub and strategic city in Henan Province, with a current population of approximately 230,000. Zhengzhou is the intersection of two major railways in northern China – the Pinghan Railway and the Longhai Railway. It connects to Beiping via Xinxiang, Anyang, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding in the north; to Hankou via Xuchang and Xinyang in the south; to Xi'an via Luoyang in the west; and to Xuzhou and Lianyungang via Kaifeng in the east. Due to this important strategic position, the gain or loss of Zhengzhou often determines the success or failure of the Central Plains battlefield. When Chiang Kai-shek launched the civil war in July two years ago, he made Zhengzhou his command center on the Longhai Line, second only to Xuzhou, and established the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, headed by Liu Zhi, the current Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou "剿匪" (Bandit Suppression) Headquarters, to command the military affairs of southwestern Shandong and the entire Henan Province. In March 1947, Chiang Kai-shek changed the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters to the Zhengzhou Forward Command Post of the Army Headquarters of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, with Sun Zhen as the director. In June of this year, after the establishment of the Xuzhou "剿总," Zhengzhou still had a forward command post, which was changed to be directed by Sun Yuanliang. After the liberation of Jinan last month, Xuzhou was in dire straits, and Sun Yuanliang led his troops eastward. The remaining enemy fled north on the 22nd, and our army occupied Zhengzhou on the same day.

　　掌握平汉陇海两大铁路枢纽
  　我军解放郑州
  　中共中央特电祝贺
    【新华社郑州前线二十二日二十四时急电】我中原人民解放军于今日占领郑州。守敌向北面逃窜，被我军包围于郑州以北、黄河铁桥以南地区，正歼击中。郑州为平汉陇海两大铁路的交点，历来为军事重镇。蒋匪因徐州告急，被迫将驻郑兵团孙元良部三个军（按国民党军从十月起整编师均改称为军，整编旅均改称为师）东调，郑州守兵薄弱，我军一到，拼命奔逃。现郑州东面之中牟县、北面之黄河桥均被我军切断，逃敌将迅速被歼。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】郑州解放，中共中央致电祝贺。电文如下：
    刘伯承、邓小平诸同志及中原人民解放军全体同志们：济南、锦州、长春解放后，郑州又告解放，陇海、平汉两大铁路的枢纽为我掌握，对于整个战局极为有利。特电祝贺。
    　　　　　　　　　　中国共产党中央委员会　一九四八年十月二十三日
    【新华社郑州前线二十三日电】郑州为河南境内最重要的交通要点和战略城市，人口现约二十三万。郑州是中国北部两条大铁路——平汉路、陇海路的交叉点，北经新乡、安阳、石家庄、保定通往北平，南经许昌、信阳通往汉口，西经洛阳通往西安，东经开封通往徐州和连云港。由于这种重要战略地位，郑州的得失，常常决定中原战局的成败。前年七月蒋介石发动内战时，即以郑州为其在陇海线上仅次于徐州的指挥中心，设郑州绥署，以现任徐州“剿匪”总司令刘峙为主任，指挥鲁西南及河南全境军事。一九四七年三月，蒋匪将郑州绥署改为伪国防部陆军总部郑州前进指挥所，以孙震为主任。今年六月，徐州“剿总”成立，郑州仍设前进指挥所，改由孙元良为主任。上月济南解放后，徐州吃紧，孙元良率部东调，余敌于二十二日向北逃窜，我军乃于当日占领郑州。
