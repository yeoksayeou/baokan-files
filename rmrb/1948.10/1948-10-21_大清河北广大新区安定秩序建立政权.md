　　[Ji Zhong Electric] In the vast new recovery area north of the Daqing River, various restoration efforts are underway. Upon hearing that our army had annihilated over 2,000 bandits under Wang Fenggang, the masses in the new areas of Gu'an and Xiongxian County spread the news and were overjoyed. A comfort delegation was spontaneously formed in a district of Xiongxian County, bringing eighteen large, fat pigs, two sheep, and a large quantity of towels and cigarettes to the front lines to show their appreciation to the troops. Notices from the Tenth Administrative Office and the Tenth Military Sub-district Political Department were posted in various villages and streets, filled with new slogans. The villagers warmly welcomed our army and actively denounced the Wang bandits. Many family members of puppet soldiers went to the prisoner groups to identify their captured children, and some, upon finding their own children, happily said, "They are liberated now." Young and middle-aged people who had fled to other places to avoid being conscripted by the Wang bandits also returned home to participate in production, and the masses in various villages are rushing to autumn plough and sow wheat, with many planning to plant more wheat. With the military victories and the development of political offensives, the masses are no longer using enemy currency. In the Sishang market in Gu'an, no one wants enemy currency anymore, and most transactions are done through barter. (Financial institutions should combine military victories to quickly expand the Hebei currency position – Editor). Local troops and local authorities are closely cooperating to disarm the scattered remnants, hold various meetings to promote our army's victory and lenient policies, call on puppet soldiers and personnel of puppet organizations to report themselves with their weapons, and conduct targeted searches based on investigations. According to incomplete statistics from a district in Xiongxian County, more than 100 guns have been seized. The scattered puppet soldiers and personnel of puppet organizations, understanding our Party's lenient policies, are also returning home one after another to change careers, and some villages have begun to restore organizations and establish political power. Dozens of newly recovered villages in Xiongxian County have established new political power and are carrying out work such as comforting military families and disaster-stricken households.

　　大清河北广大新区安定秩序建立政权
    【冀中电】大清河北广大新收复区，正进行各种恢复工作。固安、雄县新区群众，听说我军歼灭王匪凤岗二千余人后，纷纷奔走相告，欣喜异常。雄县某区自动成立了慰问团，拉着十八个大肥猪，两只羊，及大批手巾烟等奔赴前方劳军。各村街上贴上了十专署、十分区政治部布告，写满了新的标语。老乡们热情的欢迎我军，并纷纷控拆王匪。很多伪军家属，到俘虏群里认他们被抓的子弟，有的发现自己的子弟后，就高兴的说：“可解放了。”因为王匪抓丁而逃到别处的青壮年，也纷纷回家参加生产，各村群众并赶着秋耕种麦，很多群众都计划多种麦子。随着军事的胜利，政攻的开展，群众都不化敌币了。固安寺上集上敌币已没人要，大都以物换物。（金融机关应结合军事胜利，迅速扩大冀钞阵地——编者）当地军队、地方并密切配合解除溃散武装，召开各种会议，宣传我军胜利和宽大政策，号召伪军伪组织人员携枪自报，并结和调查有重点的搜剿。据雄县某区不完全统计，已搜出枪百余支。溃散的伪军伪组织人员，明白了我党宽大政策，也陆续回家转业，部分村庄已开始恢复组织建立政权。雄县数十个新收复村，已树立了新政权。正进行安慰军属、被灾户等工作。
