To the Editor:

On September 17th, we received a letter from your newspaper inquiring about a letter from reader Li Hexiang, which stated that a certain woman from Gaoyang had engaged in illegal activities and was evading legal sanctions. The details are as follows:

Li Hexiang came to Shizhuang and reported to the Municipal Party Committee that Qi Ying (the so-called "certain woman") had engaged in espionage, but he did not provide strong evidence. Later, the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee sent the materials of the case to our court. Li Hexiang filed a lawsuit in our court, claiming that Qi Ying owed him money and demanded repayment. After several interrogations, it could not be proven that Qi Ying owed him money. Li Hexiang did not inform the court of his address, so the court could not summon him. Each time, he came and we called Qi Ying to confront him. During the confrontation, they only discussed the debt issue. When asked what else Li was accusing her of, Li only said it was to collect the debt. After a clear interrogation, our court made a judgment. Because Li Hexiang could not be found, the judgment was sent to the Gaoyang County Government for forwarding to him. At this time, Qi Ying was still urging clarification of the espionage matter. Because we could not find Li Hexiang, we did not ask about this matter again. Now he writes that a certain woman is evading legal sanctions, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. Qi Ying and Li Hexiang confronted each other in court several times, so how could she evade legal sanctions?

### 李鹤祥诬称齐颍躲避法律制裁　根本与事实不符

　　李鹤祥诬称齐颍躲避法律制裁
  　根本与事实不符
    编辑同志：九月十七日接贵报来函，询问关于读者李鹤祥函称：高阳某女子有非法行为，躲避法律制裁一事，兹将详情答复于下：
    李鹤祥曾来石庄，向市委提出齐颖（即所谓某女子）有特务行为，但并未提出有力证据，后市委组织部曾将材料案情送到本院，李鹤祥到本院起诉，是说齐颖短他钱款，要求还债，经过几次审讯，不能证明齐颖短他的款子。李鹤祥不把住址告知法院，法院也无法传唤，每次都是他来了，我们才叫齐颖来对质。他两在对质当中，只谈债款问题，问李还告什么？李只说是为要债。讯问清楚后，由本院作出判决，因找不到李鹤祥，才把判决寄高阳县政府转给他，这时齐颖依然在催促弄清特务的事。我们因找不见李鹤祥，因此也未再问此事。现在他去信说某女子躲避法律制裁，根本与事实不符。齐颖和李鹤祥，几次当庭对质，何来躲避法律制裁？
