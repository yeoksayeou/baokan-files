Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liaoning, 17th. Amidst the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army on the Beining and PingSui front lines, the people of Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Liaoning are launching a surge of support for the front. The people in the newly liberated areas of Suizhong and Xingcheng are voluntarily providing tea and meals to the People's Liberation Army and vying to offer condolences. Many women and children are serving the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army throughout the night. Xingcheng's third district delivered 120,000 jin of public grain in ten days. Under the slogan "Do a good job in autumn harvest without delaying war support," able-bodied men in various counties of eastern Hebei formed a large support-the-front contingent and went to participate in the war. Women and the elderly organized themselves to take charge of the autumn harvest. At the same time, they also milled rice to rush the delivery of public grain and assumed the work of greeting wounded soldiers and sentries in the villages. County and district cadres in the eastern Rehe sub-district personally led the participating teams to set off. The directly subordinate organs of the sub-district also organized six battlefield service groups to work with the army. The sub-district Party committee also published an irregular "Mobilization Report" to reflect the dynamics of participation in the war and exchange experiences. The people of eastern and northern Chahar are also enthusiastically supporting the People's Liberation Army, which is launching an offensive in the eastern section of the PingSui Railway. Chicheng quickly milled 40,000 jin of public grain and mobilized more than 1,000 ox carts, more than 2,000 laborers, and hundreds of donkeys, setting off overnight and delivering the public grain ahead of schedule. Twenty-nine villages in the first district of Zhangbei also ground 15,000 jin of flour in ten days to supply the front lines.
