　　Marriage Must Be Voluntary
    To the Editor:
    Hou Dongwen of Dongkun Village, Fourth District, Huolu, is a retired soldier, 24 years old. Zong Zhuzhu is from Huangbi Village in the same district. In 1939, their parents arranged an engagement, with Hou Dongwen spending 60 yuan in counterfeit currency (the man was only fifteen years old at the time, and the woman eleven). In 1944, the man proposed marriage to the woman, but she disagreed. In 1946, when the man enlisted in the army, he again proposed marriage, but the woman still disagreed. Both parties sought resolution from the district. The man requested marriage, and the woman requested termination of the engagement. However, because the man was a soldier, the district government repeatedly explained to the woman, but to no avail. To ensure the marriage of revolutionary soldiers, the district government did not allow the woman to terminate the engagement. Last year, the man retired from the army due to illness and returned home. Last winter, he again proposed marriage. After mobilization by village cadres and the work team, and after several face-to-face talks between the two parties, the woman still refused. Further mobilization by the district was also unsuccessful, leading them to seek resolution from the county. On their way from the district to the county, the two even had a fight. After arriving in the county, we also mobilized the woman to agree to the marriage and explained to the man several times about terminating the engagement, but both parties insisted on their own opinions. The woman said it was an arranged marriage by her parents, and the man said the government should guarantee the marriage of retired soldiers. What is the judgment in this case? If the engagement is terminated, should the woman compensate the man for the money spent?

　　Answer: Regarding the marriage of retired soldiers, government regulations stipulate that the marriage of active soldiers should be protected, and the marriage of retired soldiers should also be taken care of, but fundamentally, it should still adhere to the principle of autonomy and voluntariness of both parties in the marriage. Hou Wendong's marriage was arranged by his parents and was a marriage of sale. Before Hou Dongwen joined the army, Zong Zhuzhu disagreed with the marriage. Now that Hou Dongwen has retired and returned, and requests marriage, but after multiple face-to-face talks between the two parties and multiple mobilizations by the district and county, it has been consistently ineffective. The government can approve the dissolution of the engagement because, if forced to reconcile, it would not benefit the family or society. As for the money spent by the man's family on the woman's family during the engagement, now that the engagement is dissolved, the government can, based on the economic situation of both families, order the woman's family to provide appropriate compensation.

专栏：询问与答复

　　婚姻要双方自愿编辑同志：
    获鹿四区东昆村侯东文，系一个荣退军人，现年二十四岁，对方宗珠珠亦系本区黄壁村人，双方在民国二十八年由父母作主侯东文花了六十元伪钞订了婚（那时男方才十五岁，女方十一岁），到民国三十三年男方提出与女方结婚，因女方不同意未结。三十五年男方入伍，又提出结婚，女方又不同意，双方到区解决，男方要求结婚，女方要求退婚，但因男方系一军人，所以区，政府再三给女方解释始终无效，但区政府为了保证革命军人的婚姻起见，未让女方退婚。男方于去年因病退伍回家，去冬又提出结婚，经村干部与工作组动员，又经过双方数次面谈，终被女方拒绝，后又经过区动员，也不成，才又来县解决，同时在双方由区到县半途还打了一架。来县以后，我们也曾动员过女方让两人结婚，也曾给男方数次解释退婚，双方均坚持自己的意见，女方说是父母包办，男方说政府应保证退伍军人结婚。这事如何判决呢？假若要退婚的话，女方所用男方的钱应否赔偿？

    答　关于荣退军人婚姻问题，按政府规定对现役军人婚姻应予保障，荣退军人婚姻也应予以照顾，但基本上还应服从于婚姻双方自主自愿之原则。侯文东的婚姻是父母作主，买卖婚姻，在侯东文参军以前宗珠珠即不同意结婚，此次侯东文退伍回来又要求结婚，经双方多次面谈及区县多次动员始终无效，政府当可批准解除婚约。因为如勉强摄合，于家庭社会并无好处。至于订婚时女家花了男家的钱，现在既解了婚约，政府可根据双方家庭经济情况，令女家酌予补偿。
