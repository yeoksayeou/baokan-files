Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Consolidated reports from TASS on the 23rd and 24th: The United Nations General Assembly began its general statements on September 23rd. The Polish representative, Mr. Mselwski, in his speech, strongly condemned the Western imperialist countries' policy of splitting Germany, attempting to turn West Germany into a reactionary stronghold. At the same time, he explained that the important resolutions passed by the General Assembly in the past to consolidate peace and security have been delayed and sabotaged, the resolution to punish war criminals has not been fulfilled, and the Atomic Energy Control Committee no longer exists. Mr. Mselwski revealed that the increase in military spending and the increase in profits of Wall Street bankers in imperialist countries are enough to explain the reasons for the failure. He then lashed out at the Marshall Plan, pointing out that this is the plan for the United States to economically and politically enslave all countries. Before the Polish representative spoke, US Secretary of State Marshall spoke, stating the US government's position on the issues of Palestine, Korea, Greece, Indonesia, Kashmir, international control of atomic energy, and reduction of armaments. The content was general, vague, and contained many reservations. This speech, which was touted as "conciliatory" by people close to the US delegation, is, in the eyes of more sober observers, a trick to directly influence the US election campaign. The US State Department is eager to paint its foreign policy with an optimistic color for voters, but the essence of this policy cannot be concealed. Marshall issued a threat at the end of his speech, announcing that the United States would not compromise on important principles. Le Monde vividly pointed out that American newspapers have never so resolutely quoted Theodore Roosevelt's words as they do now: "Speak softly and carry a big stick." At the meeting on the 24th, Wang Shijie, the representative of the Kuomintang government, hypocritically posed as the "representative of the nations of Asia and the Far East," but in reality, he spoke as a defender of the suzerain state. In his speech, he vigorously praised the illegal organization that helped split Korea—the United Nations Korean Commission, praised the notorious United Nations Indonesia Mediation Committee, which prepared the Renville Agreement and further enslaved Indonesia. Finally, he also waved the banner of attacking the principle of great power unanimity, echoing US imperialism. At the meetings on both days, representatives from the Philippines, Syria, Venezuela, Egypt, Burma, South Africa, Denmark, Turkey, and Uruguay also spoke.
　　At the afternoon meeting on the 24th, the General Assembly discussed the agenda proposals submitted by the Steering Committee. During the discussion, the Soviet representative, Mr. Malik, insisted that items that directly violated the Charter should not be included in the agenda. However, as in the Steering Committee, the General Assembly passed the Steering Committee's recommendations with a mechanically voted majority. In discussing the results of this vote, the French newspaper pointed out that "this General Assembly, like last year, is being held in an atmosphere where the American delegation is exerting pressure on the representatives of countries that depend on the United States." Combat wrote, "In the eyes of fair observers, the atmosphere of the United Nations seems to be American rather than international."

### 开始一般性发言  波代表力斥美英分裂德国王世杰跟在美帝后面呐喊

　　开始一般性发言
    波代表力斥美英分裂德国王世杰跟在美帝后面呐喊
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】综合塔斯社二十三、二十四两日报导：联合国大会于九月二十三日起开始一般性发言。波兰代表摩塞莱夫斯基在发言中力斥西方帝国主义国家分裂德国的政策，企图把西德变成反动派堡垒。同时，说明过去联大所通过的巩固和平与安全的重要决定遭到拖延破坏，惩办战争贩子的决议既未履行，原子能管制委员会又不复存在了。摩氏揭露帝国主义国家军费增加与华尔街银行家利润增加，就足以说明失败的缘由。继又痛斥马歇尔计划，指出这就是美国要在经济与政治上奴役各国的计划。波代表发言之前，美国务卿马歇尔曾发言，申述美国政府在巴勒斯坦、朝鲜、希腊、印尼、克什米尔、国际管制原子能及缩减军备诸问题上的立场，内容笼统、模糊，而且还有许多的保留。这一被接近美代表团人士渲染为“和解的”演说，在头脑较为清醒的观察家们看来，乃是直接影响美国选举运动的一个诡计。美国国务院亟欲把它的外交政策向选民们渲染上乐观的色彩，但是这个政策的本质，是掩盖不了的。马歇尔在结束他的演说时就曾发出威胁，宣布美国在重要的原则上不会妥协。巴黎解放报生动地指出，美国报纸从未如现在这样坚决地援引过老罗斯福的话：“要说话奏效，就必须柔和，但要带大棒。”二十四日会上国民党政府代表王世杰发言，虚伪地装出“亚洲和远东各民族代表”的姿态，然而实际上是以宗主国的辩护人身份发言的。他在发言中极力称赞帮助分裂朝鲜的不合法团体——联合国朝鲜委员会，颂扬臭名昭彰的、准备了伦维尔协定并使荷兰进一步奴役印尼的联合国印尼调处委员会，最后，他还摇起了攻击大国一致原则的旗帜，跟在美帝后面呐喊。两日会上，此外尚有菲、叙、委内瑞拉、埃、缅、南非、丹、土及乌拉圭等国代表发言。
    大会于二十四日下午讨论指导委员会所提交的议程建议。在讨论时，苏联代表马立克坚主那些直接破坏宪章的项目不应列入议程。但是，和在指委会一样，大会以机械地表决的多数通过了指委会的建议。在论及这一表决的结果时，法国报纸指出，“本届联大犹如去年一样，是在美国代表国对那些从在美国之国家的代表们施用压力的气氛中举行的。”战斗报写道，“在公正的观察家看来，联合国的气氛似乎是美国的而非国际的。”
