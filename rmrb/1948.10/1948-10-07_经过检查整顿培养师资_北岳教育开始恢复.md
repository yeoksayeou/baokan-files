　　North Yue Electric: After inspection and rectification and teacher training, the educational work in the third, fifth, and fourth districts of North Yue has begun to recover and develop. The new districts of the sixth district are also developing rapidly. Since the land reform, due to the leadership's relaxation of educational work, coupled with "leftist" errors in the implementation of the policy on intellectuals, the educational work in some areas has fallen into chaos and stagnation. There is only one primary school in Fangshan First District. Liangxiang High School has only had a dozen students since its establishment in the first month of this year and has not even started classes. In Tang County of the Fifth Special District, teachers were specifically sent to the countryside to engage in the land redistribution movement during the equalization campaign. After the winter vacation teacher training class, although the educational work was slightly noticed by the leadership, it was not discussed. Educational institutions are unsound, and there is a great shortage of teachers. The entire special district is currently short of 421 teachers. Political and professional leadership of teachers is also extremely inadequate. On the one hand, the spirit of teachers to serve the masses is insufficient. Furthermore, due to poor mastery of policies during the land reform, some teachers were wrongly criticized, and the teachers' thinking fluctuated greatly. Some are concerned with status and their style is undisciplined. In addition, the cultural level of teachers is too low, and some do not even recognize Arabic numerals. Some teachers say that a solar eclipse is when the sun is blocked by high mountains. In terms of social education, the blackboard newspapers in Wanping and Qingshui still write about the news of the recovery of Yan'an. Most of the slogans are outdated, and no one has rewritten them. Some places even retain the reactionary slogans of the Japanese invaders. Most of the village theatrical troupes have collapsed, and those that remain only perform old feudal and superstitious dramas, and self-compiled dramas that do not conform to policy. From May to September this year, the special district offices successively convened teacher meetings to inspect, rectify, and arrange future work. Since the educational conference in May, the Fourth Special District's education has begun to move towards recovery and development. The number of primary schools has increased from 1,380 before the wheat harvest to 1,748, and the complete primary schools are gradually being brought into line. In Fuping, due to the county party committee's strengthening of leadership and the government's and civil affairs section cadres' in-depth work, the teachers' enthusiasm for work has been greatly improved. According to statistics before the autumn break, there were 974 high school students in the county, twice as many as last year. 178 primary schools started classes, with 10,767 students, accounting for 70 percent of the county's school-age children. In Quyang, 92 primary schools started classes before the wheat harvest, and the number increased to 195 after the wheat harvest. Each district has conducted a general cultural test on primary school teachers, and the county's high schools held a general examination. The morale of teachers and students is very high. The Second District is the most active. Fuping County has also conscientiously implemented the special district education conference's resolution to increase teachers' wages. Sun Yulin, a teacher in Zhaowangtai, worked hard in teaching, and the masses automatically increased his salary to 150 jin of rice on the old scale. In the newly liberated areas of Chahar South, 320 village primary schools have been restored in Wei County and Zhuolu County, and 3,022 students have attended school, and 9 complete primary schools (7 in Wei County and 2 in Zhuolu County) have also been restored. In Wei County's 13 districts alone, 253 villages have opened schools. Yangyuan has restored one complete primary school, with 61 students. The second phase of the Chahar South Normal School's teacher training class has transformed and is transforming 330 primary school teachers. In terms of social education, Zhuolu Fifth District has established 94 blackboard newspapers, which have been written 291 times, and plans to set up 48 more. 170 people enrolled in civil schools.

　　经过检查整顿培养师资
    北岳教育开始恢复
    【北岳电】北岳三、五、四分区教育工作经过检查整顿，开始恢复与发展。六分区新区亦开展很快。土改以来，由于领导上对教育工作放松，加之在执行知识分子政策上犯了左倾错误，有些地区教育工作陷于混乱停滞。房山一区仅有一个小学；良乡高小自今年正月成立以来，到现在只有十几个学生，也没开学。五专唐县在平分运动中让教员专门下乡搞平分，迄寒假教员训练班以后，教育工作虽稍为领导所注意，但并未讨论过。教育机构不健全，教员缺额极大。现全专区仍缺四二一名。对教员政治与业务上的领导，亦极不够。一方面教员本身为群众服务的精神不够，再加土改中掌握政策差，错斗了些教员，教员思想波动很大。有的则闹地位观念，作风上自由散漫。另外，教员的文化水平太低，甚至有的不认识阿拉伯字码。有的教员说日蚀是日头被高山遮住了。在社会教育方面，宛平、清水的黑板报上，到现在还写着收复延安的消息。标语口号大部过时，也没人改写。甚至有些地方还残留着日寇的反动标语。村剧团大部垮台，仅存者亦只演封建迷信的旧剧，与不合政策的自编剧。今年五月至九月，各专署先后召开教员会议，检查整顿，布置今后工作。四专区自五月教育会议后，教育开始走向恢复与发展。现初小已由麦假前一千三百八十座增至一千七百四十八座，完小也逐渐纳入正规。阜平由于县委加强了领导，政府民教科干部工作深入，大大提高了教员的工作情绪。秋假前统计，全县高小学生九百七十四人，比去年增多两倍。初小开学的一百七十八座，学生一万零七百六十七人，占全县学龄儿童百分之七十。曲阳麦假前有九十二座小学开学，麦假后增为一百九十五座。各区对小学教师普遍的进行了文化测验，全县高小举行了一次大会考。教员学生的情绪都很高涨。尤以二区为最活跃。阜平县并认真执行了专区教育会议增加教员工资的决议。照旺台教员孙玉林教学努力，群众自动给他增薪金至老秤一百五十斤米。察南新解放区蔚县、涿鹿两县已有三百二十个村小学得到恢复，三千零二十二名学生上了学，九座完小（蔚县七座、涿鹿二座）也恢复起来。只蔚县十三个区，开学的村即已有二百五十三个。阳原恢复起来完小一座，入学者六十一人。察南师范第二期师训班已改造了与正在改造着三百三十名小学教师。社会教育方面，如涿鹿五区共建立了黑板报九十四块，已写出了二百九十一次，还计划再设四十八块。民校入学的一百七十人。
