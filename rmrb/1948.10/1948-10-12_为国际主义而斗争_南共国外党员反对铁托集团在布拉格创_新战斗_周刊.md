Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th - Electone News Agency, Prague: Yugoslav Communist Party members here have founded the weekly "New Struggle." The inaugural issue on October 1st, in an editorial titled "Under the Banner of Internationalism," stated: "After the Information Bureau made its decision regarding the Yugoslav Communist Party, all Yugoslav newspapers and periodicals became tools serving Tito's anti-Leninist and anti-Soviet propaganda, degenerating into platforms for absurdly slandering the worldwide communist movement." The journal announced that its primary task is to assist the majority of Yugoslav Communist Party members in fighting for internationalism and the victory of the Leninist line of the Yugoslav Communist Party.

Another dispatch: Lugin, the advisor to the Yugoslav Embassy in Canada (who served as Chargé d'affaires for the past eighteen months), and six other staff members resigned on the 4th of this month, announcing their departure from the Tito group. Rekmoiqu, secretary of the Yugoslav Embassy in Poland, and five others also published condemnations of the Tito group in Warsaw newspapers a few days ago, calling on Yugoslav Communist Party members to "eradicate nationalism within the Party and replace the leadership that is unwilling to correct its errors and is driving the Party and the country into a predicament." The statement declared that the Tito group's policy of terror is not a sign of strength, but rather an indication of the increasing political disintegration of Tito's rule.

    南共国外党员反对铁托集团在布拉格创“新战斗”周刊
    【新华社陕北八日电】电通社布拉格讯：此间南斯拉夫共产党员创办“新战斗”周刊，其十月一日创刊号在题为“在国际主义的旗帜下”的社论中说：“在情报局对南共作出决定以后，南斯拉夫的一切报纸和刊物，都成了为铁托反列宁主义和反苏宣传服务的工具，退化为荒谬绝伦地诽谤全世界共产主义运动的讲台。”该刊宣布它的主要任务是帮助南共大多数党员，为国际主义和南共党的列宁主义路线的胜利而斗争。
    另讯：南驻加拿大公使馆顾问芦金（过去十八个月为代理公使）及其他六职员于本月四日辞职，宣布脱离铁托集团。南驻波大使馆秘书雷克莫伊区等五人亦于日前在华沙各报发表对铁托集团的谴责，并号召南共党员“根绝党内的民族主义，撤换不愿改正错误的、将党和国家驱入困境的领导机构。”声明宣称：铁托集团的恐怖政策不是表示力量，而是表示铁托统治在政治上的日益瓦解。
