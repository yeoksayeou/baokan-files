Xinhua News Agency, East China, 9th. The Yellow River, whose water level suddenly surged at the beginning of this month, breached its banks in Changqing County, Shandong Province, west of Jinan, in an area that had been occupied by the Kuomintang and where dikes had not been built or repaired. According to an urgent report from Changqing County: The Yellow River water level rose sharply starting on the 3rd, increasing by three meters (nine city feet) in two days. The water flow was extremely turbulent. On the morning of the 5th, a breach occurred on the south bank at Silizhuang Dam, about thirty li northeast of Changqing, and the water flowed south immediately, reaching Balizhuang and Loujiazhuang Dam. At the same time, the floodwaters also reached Shijiazhuang along the Yu-Fu River, and more than twenty villages in the fourth district of Changqing County have been flooded. Cadres from neighboring counties of Changqing have been fully mobilized to lead the masses in a full-scale effort to rescue those affected by the flood. After the news of the Yellow River breach reached Jinan, the Jinan Municipal Government immediately used trucks to transport large quantities of stones, sacks, etc., to the breach for plugging, and also sent personnel to supervise and organize former Yellow River engineering personnel to go there as quickly as possible.

According to news on the 6th, the Yellow River water level was still rising. At 6:00 AM on the 6th, the water level at Luokou, north of Jinan, had risen to 30.9 meters, while the water level during last year's major flood was 30.5 meters.

　　国民党不修堤岸的遗害
    长清县境黄河决口
    【新华社华东九日电】本月初水位突然猛涨的黄河，在济南以西的一向被国民党盘据而不事修筑堤岸险工的山东长清县境决口。据长清县急报：黄河水位三日起陡涨，两日内连涨三公尺（九市尺），水势汹涌异常，五日晨已在南岸长清东北约三十里的四里庄坝决口南流，水头立即到达八里庄，楼家庄坝；同时黄水又沿淤符河到达氏家庄，长清县第四区已有二十余村　淹。刻邻近长清各县干部已全部动员起来，领导群众全力抢救水灾。黄河决口消息到达济南后，济南市政府即用汽车源源载运大批石料、麻袋等赶往堵口，同时并派员前往督导，组织旧黄河工程人员尽速前往。
    据六日消息，黄河水位尚在续涨。六日晨六时济南以北泺口水位已涨到三○·九公尺，而去年大水时的水位则为三○·五公尺。
