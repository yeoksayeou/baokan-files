(Taihang Electric Dispatch) Judging from the inspection of military dependents' production in more than ten counties including Neiqiu, Lincheng, Pingshun, and Shexian this autumn, this year's Taihang military dependents' production has been better resolved than in previous years through efforts in both promoting military dependents' self-reliance and ensuring tilling assistance. First, military dependents who have done their best to produce were commended, breaking the idea of some military dependents solely relying on tilling assistance, and fully leveraging the labor and investment capacity of military dependents. In the past, some military dependents had excessive demands on tilling assistance, or there were inappropriate aspects. Some sold the fertilizer from their own homes and asked the tilling assistance households to apply fertilizer for them; others had their family labor go out to work and earn money, relying entirely on tilling assistance for all the work in their fields. On the other hand, some military dependents who should have received tilling assistance did not. This year, the leadership continuously educated military dependents and the masses, held symposiums, first making military dependents aware of the labor difficulties in the village, empathizing with the overall situation, establishing the idea of self-reliance, and emulating model military dependents. Therefore, this year, in most areas, military dependents who were able to work actively participated in production. When weeding in Neiqiu and Zhaiyang, more than a dozen military dependents including Qiao Yuzhen, Liu Xihuan, and Qiao E spontaneously formed a mutual aid group, each weeding two mu of land a day. Su Xiaohua, a seventeen-year-old military dependent from Xizhaiyang, who had never weeded before, also participated this year. Zhang Duo's military dependent, He Erni, mobilized her sixty-year-old mother-in-law to weed in the field, and she could weed three mu a day, which was praised by the whole village. Generally, military dependents with more labor declined tilling assistance because they saw the labor difficulties in the village. On the other hand, leaders at all levels conscientiously organized the tilling assistance work, frequently inspected, promptly commended model tilling assistance households, and criticized and appropriately punished tilling assistance households who were deliberately irresponsible, causing undue losses to military dependents' production. In this way, the combination of administrative power and mass work ensured that the land of truly labor-free military dependents would not be left uncultivated. In cutting artemisia and composting fertilizer, the tilling assistance work has made more significant progress. Lincheng and other places generally proposed giving military dependents priority in cutting. All male and female military dependents also actively participated in this movement. In Heicheng, Lincheng, under the leadership of cadres and party members, all 190 men and women in the village used only half a day to cut more than 29,800 jin of artemisia grass, solving the wheat planting fertilizer for 32 military dependents' households.

　　鼓励军属生产  保证加强代耕
    太行代耕工作有进步
    【太行电】从今秋内邱、临城、平顺、涉县等十余县的检查军属生产看来，今年太行军属生产在发扬军属自力生产和保证代耕的两方面努力下，解决的较往年为好。首先是表扬了尽自己力量生产的军属，打破了某些军属单纯依靠代耕的思想，充分发挥了军属的劳动力与投资能力。过去一些军属在代耕上要求过高，或有不当之处。有的把自己家里的肥料卖了，让代耕户给自己上肥料；有的让家里劳力出外做活赚钱，自己地里活全靠代耕。另一方面，也有些应当代耕而得不到代耕的军属。今年领导上不断教育军属与群众，开座谈会，首先使军属认识了村中的劳力困难，体念大局，树立了自力生产的思想，向模范军属看齐。所以今年大部地区凡能劳动的军属，均积极参加了生产。内邱、寨阳在锄苗时，军属乔玉珍、刘喜焕、乔娥等十多个人自动组成一个互助组，每人一天锄苗二亩。西寨阳十七岁的军属苏小花从没锄过地，今年也参加了。张夺军属和娥妮动员了自己六十岁的婆母下地锄苗，一天能锄三亩，受到全村群众赞许。一般劳力较多的军属因看到村里劳力困难，便谢绝了代耕。另一方面，各级领导上认真的组织了代耕工作，经常检查，及时表扬模范代耕户，批评并适当处分了对代耕故意不负责任，致使军属生产受到不应有的损失的代耕户。这样以行政力量结合群众工作，保证了真正无劳力军属的土地不致荒芜。在割蒿沤肥中，代耕工作更有显著进步。临城等地普遍提出先给军属割。所有男女军属也积极参加了这一运动。临城黑城在干部党员带头下，全村一百九十个男女群众，仅用半天时间即割了两万九千八百多斤蒿草，解决了三十二户军属的种麦肥料。
