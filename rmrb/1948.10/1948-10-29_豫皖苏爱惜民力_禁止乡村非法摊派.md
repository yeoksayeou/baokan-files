Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 22nd. The Yu-Wan-Su Administrative Office and the Yu-Wan-Su Military Region of the Central Plains Liberated Area, in order to cherish the people's strength, facilitate the restoration and development of production, and better support the People's Liberation War, jointly issued a proclamation prohibiting all illegal apportionment and random requisitioning in rural areas. The proclamation stipulates: (1) In addition to the financial and grain burden stipulated by the Administrative Office, all illegal apportionment in rural areas shall be cancelled. District and village governments have no right to allocate funds. The office expenses and cadre treatment of administrative villages (or townships) shall be paid in accordance with the regulations of the Administrative Office, and shall not be apportioned by themselves. (2) Military and political personnel passing through villages and towns shall pay for food and lodging in accordance with regulations with grain and firewood coupons or meal fees.

All villages and towns shall also not arbitrarily apportion grain and money for the sake of entertaining or comforting. (3) It is strictly forbidden for rear institutions and troops to randomly requisition corvée labor at ordinary times without following regulations. When troops use civilian labor during wartime, the logistics organs shall allocate it uniformly in accordance with the prescribed procedures. (4) When it is necessary to raise funds for rural public welfare undertakings (such as running schools, water conservancy, disaster relief, etc.), it must be discussed and approved by the villagers' congress or township representatives' meeting and submitted to the district office, and then the county government shall formulate unified measures and submit them to the special office for approval before funds can be raised. Accounts should be settled on schedule, submitted to the district for review, and formally announced to the villagers' congress or township representatives' meeting. The proclamation also stipulates: Anyone who violates the above provisions should be rejected by the masses, and can be reported to the government. Once verified, they will be severely punished.
