　　How should conflicts between mines and local areas be handled?
To the Editors:
    There are many connections between mines and local areas. If the relationship is not handled well, the work will be greatly hindered. It has been more than a year since the liberation of the Jingxing Mine. There have been five or six large-scale joint meetings between local (county and district) cadres and mine cadres, and even more small meetings or individual consultations. Many problems have been resolved in meetings, and resolutions have been issued, but the same problems remain problems today. The main reason is that the two sides have very different views and understandings of the issues. For example:
    I. The issue of mine employment. Local areas request that more unemployed old cadres, disabled soldiers, and ordinary farmers be introduced to work in the mine, but the mine often cannot fully accept this. Therefore, local cadres say that "the mine only employs Kuomintang members, even spies and bad elements," and that the workers' "class background is not good," etc. The mine, on the other hand, says that "local cadres do not understand the principles of enterprise management and do not cherish the people's enterprise enough," and that "we are not a relief agency." This is a serious disagreement that has not been resolved for a long time.
    II. The mine's land and houses were distributed to unemployed workers or farmers after liberation. At a joint meeting, the higher authorities decided that the mine should recover ownership, and the mine would temporarily grant usage rights if it was not needed. Local cadres disagreed, saying, "Once it's distributed, it can't be taken back. This puts local cadres and agencies in an awkward position." But the mine wants to implement the instructions and decisions of the higher authorities, saying, "This is beneficial to the development of the people's mining industry."
    III. Local county and district agencies request free electricity, but the mine says, "This violates the principles of enterprise management."
    IV. Private small kilns borrowed mine materials, especially electric water pumps, last autumn, and have not returned them after the deadline. The mine urgently needs them. Several meetings with county and district cadres have failed to resolve the issue. Finally, a conflict occurred. Mine workers went to the small kilns to demand the motors and were beaten and tied up by villagers and small kiln personnel. For a long time, county and district cadres have insisted on supporting the villagers and small kilns, saying, "The people are in difficulty," and "This is the mass viewpoint." The mine says, "If we run the mine well, solve the livelihood of the majority of people and meet the needs of the majority, this is the real mass viewpoint."
    V. "Guarding the mine, one cannot use coal near the coal pile." Local areas hope for preferential treatment for coal, but the mine does not agree to this preferential treatment.
    VI. Villagers around the mine destroy roads and highways, obstructing coal transport vehicles. The mine believes that the local area is not providing leadership or taking responsibility. The local area is not interested in this issue.
    VII. Villagers disagree with a worker from their village going to work and demand that the worker be directly returned from the mine or detained. Some district officials support the villagers' opinions, saying that they cannot violate "the will of the masses." The mine disagrees, thus causing conflict.
    The issue of workers' duty is the first major and difficult problem to solve. The mine's opinion is that war duties affect national production during wartime. The local area says: The higher authorities have assigned them, and the county and district have no way to deal with it.
    The above are just a few important and frequently existing problems. Apart from the duty issue, I believe it is just a matter of understanding enterprise management. I hope for a reply.

    Answer: The issues raised by Comrade Yang Yuan are very important. We have sent a letter to the Industry and Commerce Department of the North China People's Government, and their opinion is as follows:
    I. The Jingxing Coal Mine is a state-owned industry and a production agency. The use of cadres and workers in the coal mine should be based on the benefit of production, not on class background. It is wrong to start from a relief perspective.
    II. The ownership of the land and houses of the Jingxing Coal Mine should belong to the coal mine. It is permissible to lend them to farmers for temporary use if they are not needed, but it is wrong to distribute them to farmers. Now, in order to carry out production, ownership should be recovered; if they are not needed temporarily, they can continue to be lent to farmers for use. It is wrong to think that the land and houses of the Jingxing Coal Mine should be distributed to farmers and to equate the people's public property with the land of landlords.
    III. No one has the special privilege of using electricity and coal for free.
    IV. If private small kilns borrow machines from the mine, they should be returned when the mine needs them. Because the development of large mines is the most important thing. Accommodating the temporary interests of small mines will hinder the long-term interests of the people.
    V. If the masses destroy roads and obstruct the passage of coal trucks, the local government must seriously and thoroughly investigate and stop it, and should not take a indifferent attitude.
    VI. The village government has no right to restrict the freedom of workers to go to work, and even less to detain workers at will. It is a serious mistake for a certain district cadre not only to fail to correct this illegal behavior in time, but to support the masses in making trouble with the mine.
    VII. War duty is the people's obligation to the country, and workers should also bear it. In order to increase production and support the war, factory workers can pay a certain amount of war service fee to be exempted from their duty. This shall be uniformly stipulated by the North China People's Government.
    From the above facts, the poor relationship between the local area and the mine is mainly due to the fact that some local cadres have agricultural socialist ideas in their thinking, thus one-sidedly emphasizing the current interests of the farmers, and do not know the importance of developing industry for the construction of a new democratic country. If this continues to develop, it will be harmful to industrial development.
    However, the above situation is only based on Comrade Yang Yuan's personal reflection. In the actual handling of the problem, if there are still specific difficulties in the local area, they can also be raised for study. It is reported that the relevant leading organs are actively solving the problem of the relationship between the Jingxing Coal Mine and the county and district. The presentation of these issues can be used for reference.

### 矿山与地方上的矛盾应如何处理？

专栏：询问与答复

　　矿山与地方上的矛盾应如何处理？编辑同志：
    矿山与地方上的牵连问题很多，如果关系搞不好，工作会受到很多障碍。井陉矿解放已经一年多了，地方（县区）干部与矿山干部举行联席会议大规模的也有五六次，小会或个别商谈那就更多了，许多问题曾经在会议中解决，也曾经印发过决议，但是同样的问题直到今天还是成为问题，主要原因是双方看问题认识问题有很大的不同，譬如：
    一、矿山用人问题，地方要求多介绍一些无处安插的旧干部，或者残废军人及一些普通农民到矿作工，而矿上往往不能完全接受采纳。因此，地方干部说“矿山净用国民党，甚至特务坏分子”，说工人“成份不好”等。矿山方面则说“地方干部不了解企业化原则，爱护国家人民的企业不够”，“我们不是救济机关”。这是一个严重的分歧，长时期不得解决。
    二、矿山的土地房屋，解放后曾经分散给失业工人或农民，在联席会上上级决定叫矿山收回所有权，矿山不用以前暂时给予使用权。地方干部则不同意，说：“分了就不能再收回，这是叫地方干部与机关坐蜡”。但矿山又要执行上级意图与决定，说“这于发展人民的矿业有利”。
    三、地方县区各机关要求免费用电，矿山说“这违反企业化原则”。
    四、民间小窑在去年秋季借用矿山材料，特别是电动抽水机，越期未还，矿山又急于需要，几次与县区干部开会不能解决，最后还是发生冲突，矿山工人到小窑去要电机，被村民小窑人员打了捆了。长时县区干部坚持给村民小窑撑腰，说“老百姓困难”，“这是群众观点”。矿山说“我们把矿办好，解决多数人的生活与多数人的需要，这是真的群众观点”。
    五、“守着矿山在煤堆旁不能用煤”，地方希望优待煤，矿山不答应这种优待。
    六、周围村庄老百姓破坏道路破坏公路，阻碍运煤车辆，矿山认为地方不领导不负责，地方对这一问题则不感兴趣。
    七、村民不同意某个该村工人上工，就要从矿上直接要回或扣留上工，某些区的负责干部支持村民群众的意见，说是不能违反“群众意志”，矿山不同意，因此闹意见。
    工人勤务问题，这是第一个重大而难解决的问题，矿山的意见战争勤务影响了战时国家生产，地方说：上级派下来县区无办法。
    以上仅仅是举了几件重要的而且是经常存在着的问题，除勤务问题以外，我认为只是一个企业化的认识问题，望予答复。

    答：杨源同志所反映的问题很重要，我们已函问华北人民政府工商部，他们的意见是这样的：
    一、井陉煤矿是国营工业，是生产机关，煤矿使用干部与工人应以有利于生产为标准，不应以成份为标准，从救济观点出发是不对的。
    二、井陉煤矿的土地房屋，其所有权应归煤矿，以前暂时不用，借给农民使用是可以的，但分给农民是不对的。现在为了进行生产，应将所有权收回；暂时不用的，还可以继续借给农民使用。认为井陉煤矿的土地房屋应当分给农民，把人民的公共财产与地主土地同等看待是错误的。
    三、任何人都没有免费用电与免费烧煤的特权。
    四、民间小窑借用矿上的机器，在矿上需要时，是应当归还的。因为发展大矿是主要的，如迁就小矿的暂时利益，是会妨碍人民的长远利益的。
    五、群众破坏道路，阻碍煤车通行，地方政府须认真彻底追查制止，不应采取漠不关心的态度。
    六、村政府无权限制工人上工的自由，更不得随便扣留工人。对这种违法行为，某区干部不惟不及时纠正，反支持群众向矿上闹意见，是严重的错误。
    七、战争勤务是人民对国家的义务，工人也应负担，工厂工人为了增加生产，支援战争，可缴纳一定的战务费，免除其勤务。由华北人民政府统一规定。
    从上述事实看来，地方和矿上的关系不好，主要是由于某些地方干部在思想上存在着农业社会主义思想，因而片面的强调农民目前利益，不知道发展工业对于新民主主义国家建设的重要性。如果继续发展下去，对于工业发展是有害的。
    但上述情况仅是根据杨源同志个人的反映。在实际处理问题中，地方上是否尚有具体困难，亦可提出研究。据闻井陉煤矿与县区关系问题，有关领导机关正积极解决，这些问题的提出可供参考。
