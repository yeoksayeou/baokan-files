Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd. This year's autumn harvest in the Jiaodong area is quite bountiful. Generally, areas are yielding about 70-80% of their crops, with some individual areas achieving average harvests. Spring corn, sorghum, and millet have largely been harvested. In Donghai, corn yields average around six to seven *dou* per *mu* (approximately 27 *jin* per *dou*), with fertilized areas yielding over one *shi*. Millet yields are about seven *dou* per *mu* (approximately 20 *jin* per *dou*). In the Beihai Huang (County) Long (kou) plains, yields are over 80%, with irrigated corn reaching 570 to 600 *jin* per *mu*. In the Xihai areas of Yexian and Pingdu, sorghum and millet generally yield 200 *jin* per *mu*, with good yields reaching 250 to 300 *jin*. In Binbei Jiaogao County (newly established, parts of Jiaoxian and Gaomi), due to the democratic government's leadership in river repair and water management this spring, average yields are 200 *jin* per *mu*. This is the first such harvest in ten years.

The Jiaodong harvest is the result of the entire region's full-scale production and disaster relief efforts, overcoming the severe spring and summer famines. Last year, the Kuomintang bandit army's desperate offensive in Jiaodong caused a serious famine, with 37 affected counties, accounting for 88% of the total area. Coupled with floods, insect plagues, hailstorms, tsunamis, and epidemics, two million disaster-stricken people faced starvation in the spring and summer, accounting for one-fifth of the region's population. In such a dire situation, the Party, government, army, and people throughout the region responded to the call of the East China Bureau of the CPC to "not leave an acre of land uncultivated in production, and not let a single person starve in disaster relief," launching a production and disaster relief campaign. The Jiaodong Administrative Office first distributed agricultural production loans totaling 472.98 million Beihai currency and 19.48 million *jin* of grain. In addition, relief grain, work-for-relief programs, and summer tax reductions totaled 45.7 million *jin*. Social mutual aid was also promoted, and local health teams treated a total of 156,000 patients, most of whom returned to production. During the campaign, the leading organs grasped the principle of making production and disaster relief the central task of all work. They criticized the narrow "poor peasant and hired farmhand line" and the mistake of "kicking aside" old cadres with problematic work styles, replacing them with the correct line of organizing and transforming organizations. They also extensively and repeatedly publicized policies such as developing family wealth through production and becoming rich through labor. Party committees at all levels organized production and disaster relief committees and various work teams to work in areas severely affected by the disaster. Before the summer harvest, they also timely raised the issue of opposing complacency and emphasizing the long-term and year-round nature of production and disaster relief. All government offices and schools also lowered their living standards and helped the masses in production, gradually making production and disaster relief a mass movement. In the past six months, the region has cultivated nearly one million *mu* of wasteland, and the Xihai, Nanhai, and Beihai sub-districts have adjusted approximately 285,000 *mu* of land. Pingdong (newly established county, east of Pingdu) and other 15 counties dredged rivers, dug canals, and protected over one million *mu* of farmland. Through these efforts, the region not only overcame the serious famine but also achieved a bountiful autumn harvest. Now, the production enthusiasm of the masses has greatly increased, and they are actively engaged in autumn plowing and planting.

　　全力进行生产救灾的结果
    胶东秋季丰收
    【新华社华东二日电】胶东区今年秋收尚称丰稔。一般地区约收七、八成，个别地区中成年景，现各地春苞米、高粱、谷子大体已收割完毕。东海各地的苞米平均每亩收六、七斗（每斗二十七斤）左右，经施肥的可收一石以上；谷子每亩收七斗（每斗二十斤）左右。北海黄（县）龙（口）平原收八成以上，浇水的苞米每亩可收五百七十斤至六百斤。西海掖县、平度等地，高粱、谷子一般每亩可收二百斤，好的可收二百五十至三百斤。滨北胶高县（新设县，胶县、高密各一部）因今春民主政府领导群众修河治水，平均每亩可收二百斤。这是十年来未有的丰收。
    胶东的丰收是全区人民全力进行生产救灾，克服了严重的春荒夏荒的结果。去年国民党匪军在胶东的挣扎性攻势造成严重灾荒，受灾县份达三十七个，占全区总面积的百分之八十八；加以水灾、虫灾、雹灾、海啸灾、病疫等接踵而至，春夏两季断炊绝粮的灾胞达二百万，占全区人口五分之一。在如此严重的情况下，全区党政军民响应了中共华东局“生产不荒掉一亩地，救灾不饿死一个人”的号召，展开了生产救灾运动。胶东行署首先发放农业生产贷款北海币四亿七千二百九十八万元，粮食一千九百四十八万斤，另救济粮，以工代赈及夏征减免粮共四千五百七十万斤，并开展社会互助互济，各地卫生队门诊先后治愈病人共十五万六千人，大部投入生产。在运动中，领导机关掌握了以生产救灾为一切工作的中心任务的方针，批判了狭隘的“贫雇农路线”及对作风上有毛病的老干部“一脚踢开”的错误，而代之以通过组织、改造组织的正确路线，并广泛反复宣传生产发家、劳动致富等政策。各级党委又组织了生产救灾委员会及各种工作队分赴灾情严重地区工作。夏收前，并适时提出反对麻痹自满，强调生产救灾的长期性与长年性。各机关学校亦降低生活标准，并帮助群众生产，使生产救灾逐步成为广大群众运动。半年来全区耕种荒地近一百万亩，西海、南海、北海三个分区调剂土地约二十八万五千余亩。平东（新设县，平度东）等十五县疏河、挖渠护田百余万亩。经过这些努力，全区不仅克服了严重的灾荒，而且获得了秋季的丰收。现在群众生产情绪大大提高，正积极从事秋耕秋种中。
