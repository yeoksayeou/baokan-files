    Comrade Yang Congzhi of the Ren County Civil Affairs Section:

    All those working in New Democratic state organs and people's revolutionary organizations, regardless of their specific duties, should enjoy the treatment of revolutionary staff. Dong Huifen, as an apprentice in the Industry and Commerce Bureau, should also be recognized as a revolutionary staff member. Her family should be treated as revolutionary family members. In addition, escaped soldiers who are now serving in state-owned shops should be allowed to return to their units, but this must be done through education and mobilization, not through forced orders. Comrade Zhang Feng, Jinzhong Front Line:

    Regarding the issue of returning houses in Yincheng Town, Changzhi, it has been forwarded to the Changzhi County Committee, please ask them to investigate and handle it. Mr. Qi Xigui, Zhuangtou Village, Pingshan:

    The matter of the items of martyr Qi Linkui being detained en route has been forwarded to the North Yue Military Region Headquarters, please ask them to investigate. Mr. Shi Longtian, Xingtai City:

    Your report on the situation of state-owned shops in Xingtai City purchasing fruits from the masses at low prices for their own production has been forwarded to the North China Government Industry and Commerce Department for inspection. Mr. Gao Jianzhong and Mr. Li Shouming, Pingding County:

    Regarding the incident of a train running over and killing someone at the Xiapan Bridge on the Zhengtai Railway, it has been forwarded to the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau, please ask them to investigate and handle it. Mr. Wang Jilai, Xingtang:

    Your suggestion on protecting railway materials is very good, and it has been forwarded to the North China Government Communications Department for their attention. Mr. Wang Ziying and Mr. Wang Yan:

    Item (a) of Article 4 of the Land Law Outline refers to the reclamation of wasteland. Your situation is not suitable for applying this article and should be handled according to the reply of your district chief. Mr. Cheng Ci Mi Huaiyin:

    The decision of the CCP Central Committee on the two documents of 1933 explained the issue of the demarcation between rich peasants and middle peasants, which should be based on other documents published by the Central Committee and Comrade Ren Bishi's report. Therefore, an exploitation income exceeding 25% classifies one as a rich peasant. Comrade Fu Zimo, Wu Xiang County Government:

    The fact that Chen Wanqing and Fan Yongzeng's pharmacies in Duan Village of your county were handed over to the masses during the land reform due to fear of being struggled against was caused by the "leftist" deviation in the work of the village at that time. Now the pharmacies should be returned to their original owners. Mr. Zhang Jinwen, Tenth District, Huolu:

    It is wrong for Yongbi Village not to leave land for fugitive households during the land reform. Now that the fugitive households have returned, if they can transfer to industry and commerce, they can be advised to change careers. If they cannot change careers, the village should find ways to allocate land to them, resettle them, and enable them to live and engage in production. Mr. Zhao Jinwen, Quyang:

    It is wrong for the village to expel you after Chen Pangui, the person you partnered with in business who was struggled against, ran away. You should be compensated.

    任县民政科杨从之同志：
    凡在新民主国家机关和人民革命团体中工作，不论其分工如何，都应享受革命职员之待遇，董惠芬在工商局当练习生，亦应取得革命职员成份。其家庭当按革命家属待遇。另外，逃亡战士已到公营商店服务，亦应让其归队，但必须采用教育动员方式，不应强迫命令。晋中前线张峰同志：

    你县段村陈万清、范永增两家药铺，在土改中因怕被斗交给群众，这是当时该村工作有左倾偏向所致，现在应将药铺归还原主。获鹿十区张进文君：
    永壁村在土改中不给逃亡户留土地，是不对的，现在逃亡户归来，如能转工商业，可劝其转业，如不能转业，该村应设法给他们调剂土地，予以安置，使其能生活。并从事生产。曲阳赵进文君：
    你与被斗户陈盘贵合伙做生意，因陈盘贵逃跑，村中将你扫地出门是不对的，应予补偿。
