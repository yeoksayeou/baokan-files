Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Electric Dispatch: According to newspapers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Li, the section chief of the Land and Food Department of the puppet Qujiang County government in Guangdong, led two soldiers to Houmentian Sixth Bao, Datang Township, on August 6 to collect grain, detaining the mother of a villager surnamed He. More than 30 villagers gathered and took He's mother back. During the grain requisition period last year, people in various parts of Guangdong Province rose up in resistance due to unbearable oppression. According to a report in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao on July 24, the provincial puppet Land and Food Department statistics showed that a total of 137 grain requisition personnel were beaten to death, injured, or captured by the people, including 68 deaths, 13 injuries, and 56 captures. The counties with the most personnel killed were Lufeng, with 11, Hua County, with 9, Longmen, with 7, and Zhongshan and Qin County, with 6 each.
