　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 10th: TASS, Paris, October 5th: French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez, in speeches in Avignon and Bourg in central France, pointed out that the increasing impoverishment of the French people and the chaotic state of French finances can be explained by the fact that US imperialism attempts to pass on its expenses from the last war to the shoulders of the working people, and by the preparations for a third world war for the benefit of US imperialism and under the guidance of US imperialism. These preparations for new wars include the signing of the Brussels Five-Power Military Treaty, the London Conference's agreement on establishing a separate West German state, and the organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Brussels Treaty Five. Thorez continued, stating that these war preparations have already cost France 450 billion francs, which is about half of France's annual budget. Thorez exposed the conspiracy of the United States and its vassal states against Germany, saying: "They are attempting to discuss the Berlin issue separately from the entire German issue, however their basis for staying in Berlin is precisely the agreement that they have shamefully violated in order to establish a separate West German state to oppose the Soviet Union."

　　多列士演说：
    指出备战使法人民贫困揭露美帝对德国的阴谋
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社巴黎五日电：法共总书记多列士在法国中部亚威农和布尔发表演说，指出法国人民的日益贫困以及法国财政所以陷于混乱状态，可以由美帝国主义企图把其上次大战中的开支转嫁到劳动人民肩上，及为了美帝国主义利益，并在美帝国主义指导之下，而准备第三次大战的事实，得到解释。这些新战争的准备就是布鲁塞尔五国军事公约的签订、伦敦会议对建立分立的西德国家的协定，及布鲁塞尔公约五国联合参谋总部的组织等。多列士继称，这一战争准备已使法国化费了四千五百亿法郎，即约当法国全年预算的半数。多列士揭露美国及其附庸国对德国的阴谋称：“他们企图把柏林问题离开整个德国问题来讨论，然而他们留在柏林的根据，恰恰就是被他们为建立西德分立国家以反对苏联时所可耻地违背了的协定。”
