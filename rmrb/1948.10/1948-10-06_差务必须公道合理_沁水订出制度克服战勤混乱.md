【Taiyue Electric】 The Qinshui County government convened a village wartime service director meeting on September 1st and discovered the following problems in wartime service work: 1. Only knowing how to use civilian labor, not paying attention to cherishing civilian labor. The wartime service methods of each village are not uniform, and there are many unfair aspects. In some villages, the wartime service director directly assigns tasks to households; in others, the wartime service director assigns tasks to the household via dispatchers or dispatch squad leaders, who then assign tasks to the households. Some village cadres deduct six days of office work per month (as a substitute for service), while others deduct only three days. Some cadres at the level of *lizhang* (neighborhood head) and above also use attending village meetings as a substitute for service. There are also many instances of cadres shielding and concealing. For example, Li Zi'e's family in Miaogou Village Agricultural Association: his father, child, and he himself are all of service age, but none of them perform service. Guo Shenghua, the *lixi* (village head) of Lingxi Village, whose father is of service age, only performed five days of service from January to July, while Chang Huailan, who is of similar age and physical condition, performed forty-eight days of service during the same period. The Public Security Director of Xiwending has not performed service since liberation. 2. The higher levels only assign work to the lower levels, without proper promotion and inspection. Work such as preferential treatment for military families has not been done well. According to known information, sixty-two households in seventeen villages have left 316 *mu* of land uncultivated due to not receiving good preferential treatment. In the first district, six households in Wangzhai Village have left 24.5 *mu* uncultivated. In the third district, five households in Zhongcun Village have left 31 *mu* uncultivated. In the fourth district, eight households in Linghou Village have left 50 *mu* uncultivated. 3. The work style of administrative orders and unfair assignment of tasks are very serious. Yuan Jiyuan of Tuanli Village said: "In the past, when assigning tasks, people would assign less to those they heard of, and more to those who caused trouble. Or, they would force people to go on long and difficult tasks." Chen Ruyu of Libi Village said: "In the past, we assigned tasks with a localist mindset: if there was a task going to Yangcheng that could bring back coal, we would send someone from our village; tasks going elsewhere would be assigned from other villages." Zhao Cunfu of Zhongcun Village said: "In the past, when assigning tasks, we would always ask the masses about their attitude. Even if people were upset, they still had to go, and they wouldn't be satisfied with us?" Recently, everyone studied several ways to improve wartime service work: 1. The method of assigning tasks should be unified and fair. The village wartime service director should directly manage the households. Create a detailed account of the base-level porter teams, rear transport teams, and labor-superior people and animal power, and each *lilizhang* should also keep a copy. When there is a service task, the wartime service director assigns names to the *lilizhang*. If someone is not at home or is unable to go due to illness, the *lilizhang* assigns replacements from the roster, ensuring that everyone of service age performs service. 2. Keep service records and use service tickets. Participation in war should be combined with production, and service tickets and work points can be exchanged. 3. Conscientiously provide preferential treatment to military families. Each village should accurately calculate according to the actual situation of military families, revolutionary martyrs' families, and honored veterans, determining which households should receive labor preferential treatment, how much labor preferential treatment is needed, and then reasonably allocate it according to the total manpower and animal power of the village, fixing which households receive preferential treatment and how much, ensuring that the land is cultivated well, and cadres must be responsible for inspection.

　　差务必须公道合理
    沁水订出制度克服战勤混乱
    【太岳电】沁水县政府于九月初一召开了村战勤主任会议，发现战勤工作中有以下几个问题：一、只知道使用民力，不注意爱惜民力。各村服勤办法不统一，不公道的地方很多。有的村是战勤主任直接派到户，有的村是战勤主任派到户，这里有派差员或是派差小队长，再派到户。村干部有的是每月扣六天办公天（顶勤），有的只扣三天。有的是闾长以上的干部在村关会也顶勤。干部包庇隐瞒的事情也很多。庙沟村农会李子萼家日，他父亲、孩子跟他三个人都在服勤年龄，都不服勤。岭西村长郭生华的父亲在服勤年龄，从一月到七月只服了五天勤，跟他年龄身体差不多的常怀兰，在同一期间，就服了四十八天勤。西文兴的公安主任，从解放后就没服过勤。二、上边只向下边布置工作，没有好好的推动检查，优军等工作都没作好。据知道的十七个村就有六十二户因为没优待好，荒了三百一十六亩地。一区的王寨六户就荒了二十四亩半。三区的中村五户荒了三十一亩。四区的岭后八户荒了五十亩。三、行政命令的作风和派差不公的现象很厉害，团里村元积元说：“过去派差，那个人听说就少派他两回，那个人闹别扭就多派他几次。或是过上长差、苦差非叫他去不行。”里必村陈如煜说：“过去咱派差都有本位作风：碰上到阳城去的差，回来能捎炭，就叫本村人去；到别处的差就从外庄上派。”中乡村赵存福说：“过去派差动不动就跟群众要态度，人家受了气还得去，心里还就对咱满意？”最近大家研究出几个改进战勤工作的办法：一、派差办法要统一要公道。村战勤主任直接掌握户。把基干担运队、后方运输队和劳优的人畜力造一个底帐，各闾闾长也保存一份。有勤务下来，战勤主任派出名子交给闾长。要是有不在家或害病不能去的，闾长按名册持着往下补派，保群在服勤年龄的一律服勤。二、记勤帐，用勤票。参战要和生产结合，勤票工票可以互相顶换。三、认真优待军属。各村要按军、烈属和荣誉军人的实际情况，精确计算，那些户该受劳力优待，需要优待多少工，再按全村人畜力合理分配，固定那几家优待，那一家多少工，保证把地种好，干部一定要负责检查。
