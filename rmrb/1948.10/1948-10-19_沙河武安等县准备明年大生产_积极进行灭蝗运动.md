[Taihang News] The Taihang Mountains have a tradition of fighting locusts and providing disaster relief. In recent years, due to insufficient attention from the leadership and the lack of active work by some local cadres, locusts have been discovered in Shahe, Wu'an, Lincheng, Ci County, Lin County, Anyang and other counties in late September and early October. In Shahe, nineteen villages including Cejing, had some wheat seedlings eaten in patches or by the row. In Ci County, locusts have spread to six districts and forty-six villages. In severely affected areas, there are more than thirty locusts per square step. Locusts were found in five districts of Wu'an, and more than one hundred mu of wheat seedlings were eaten in Xue Village, and three to four qing of wheat seedling fields were damaged at the He Village base point. Many people were afraid that locusts would eat wheat seedlings and dared not plant wheat. In Lincheng, grasshoppers were found in more than thirty villages in the first, second, and fourth districts. The eating of wheat seedlings was very serious. According to statistics from Beibaigejing on the 9th of this month, nineteen plots with a total of forty-two mu of wheat seedlings were eaten. Many three or five ridges were also eaten. The ninth district of Lin County is the fourth occurrence, with an area of more than 3,500 mu. The locust plague in Anyang is even more serious. According to statistics from fifty-one villages in seven districts, more than 5,350 mu of late millet and small corn have been eaten.

At the beginning of the locust discovery, the damage was great in some places due to insufficient vigilance in the leadership's thinking. For example, in Shahe, the leadership did not understand the locust situation for ten days after the discovery, and the cadres did not pay attention. On the mass side, there was also a fluke paralysis thought, thinking that the weather was getting cold soon, and the locusts would be frozen to death soon, and that there would be no more locusts after a rain, and that there would be nothing left in the fields soon. Therefore, the fight was not active. Some people were also afraid of trampling on the ground or felt it was difficult to fight because of the heavy dew. These ideas were overcome successively in the continued development of the locust plague and the leadership's urgent organization of the fight. The Shahe County Government issued instructions, proposing the slogans "resolutely protect wheat seedlings" and "do not let locusts lay eggs and affect next year's large-scale production." Comrade Li Qingtai, the Secretary of Lincheng County, personally organized the masses to fight in Chengdi, and called on the disaster-stricken villages to replant in time, organize the masses to combine autumn ploughing and replanting with weeding to eliminate locusts, so that locusts have no hiding place, and prevent major problems next year. The Taihang Sixth Special Office also issued a locust control circular, calling on all counties to seize the opportunity to organize the masses to fight during the autumn harvest and wheat planting, so as to ensure that locust control and wheat planting are not delayed, and to overcome the idea of some people who are unwilling to fight locusts and dare not plant wheat. It was also pointed out that the eaten wheat seedlings should be replanted quickly. Attention should be paid to not trampling on wheat fields during locust control. Cadres and masses in various locust-affected areas are now working hard to fight. Yangjiaying and Guanzhuang villages in Lin County eliminated 742 mu of soil locusts in three days; more than 540 people in Jiaonigou and other five villages in the second district of Lincheng participated in the fight and eliminated more than 330 mu of pests in three days.

　　沙河武安等县准备明年大生产
  　积极进行灭蝗运动
    【太行讯】太行山是有打蝗救灾传统的区域，年来由于领导上注意不够，某些地方干部工作不积极，以致最近沙河、武安、临城、磁县、林县、安阳等县，于上月下旬与本月初先后发现蝗虫。沙河有册井等十九个村，有的麦苗地一片两片或一耧两耧被吃掉。磁县蝗虫已发展到六个区四十六个村，严重的地方，每方步有三十多个。武安发现蝗虫的有五个区，薛村有百余亩麦苗被吃光，和村基点吃坏麦苗地三四顷。许多群众怕蝗虫吃麦苗，不敢种麦。临城一、二、四区三十余村普遍发现蚂蚱，吃麦苗很严重，据本月九号北白鸽井统计，被吃光麦苗的有十九块共四十二亩。三垄五垄被吃掉的也很多。林县九区是第四次发生，面积已达三千五百余亩。安阳蝗灾更为严重，据七个区五十一个村统计，被吃的晚谷小玉茭达五千三百五十余亩。
    这次蝗虫的发现，开始因领导思想上的警惕不够，有些地方危害很大，如沙河发现十来天领导上还不了解蝗情如何，干部亦未注意。在群众方面也有侥幸麻痹思想，以为天快冷了，很快就会把蝗虫冻死，又认为下一场雨就没了，地里快没东西了等。因此扑打也不积极。还有怕把地踏坏或嫌露水重难打等。这些思想在蝗灾继续发展及领导上急起组织扑打中，先后克服。沙河县府发出指示，提出“坚决保护麦苗”，“不让蝗虫下了蛋，影响明年大生产”等号召。临城县书李清太同志在澄底亲自组织群众扑打，并号召灾村及时补种，组织群众结合秋耕补种割草等肃清蝗虫，使蝗虫无藏身之地，防止来年留下大患。太行六专署并发出打蝗通报，号召各县于秋收种麦中，抓紧组织群众扑打，做到打蝗种麦两不误，克服某些不愿打蝗又不敢种麦的思想。并指出吃坏的麦苗要赶快补种。要注意在打蝗中不要踏坏麦地。现各发现蝗虫地区的干部群众，正在努力扑打中。林县杨家营、官庄等村三天消灭七百四十二亩的土蚂蚱；临城二区胶泥沟等五个村，五百四十余人参加捕打，三天消灭了三百三十余亩地的虫害。（振卫、善校、修志、政民、森林、安阳县政府等）。
