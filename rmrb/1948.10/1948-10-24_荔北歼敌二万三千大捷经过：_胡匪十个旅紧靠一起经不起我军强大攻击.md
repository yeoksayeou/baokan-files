Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 22nd: A frontline reporter reports on the great victory of the Northwest People's Liberation Army in annihilating more than 23,000 enemy troops in the Dali area, stating: In early August, our army severely damaged the 36th Division of the Hu bandits in the Huanglong Campaign, initiating the prelude to the autumn offensive. The Hu bandits hastily adjusted their defensive deployment along the line from Chaoyi in the east to ＠ County in the west. On one hand, through their rumor company, the Central News Agency, they clamored that "a powerful deployment has been formed" and that "sweeping operations are being carried out from the Luo River to the Yellow River near Chengcheng," to cover up their defeat. After a month of training, our army first launched an attack on the enemy's elite troops, the 17th and 38th Divisions. The offensive began at dawn on the 6th, on the entire front of about 20 li between Siqian, Tihu, and Yongfengzhen (40 li south of Chengcheng), successively capturing 12 fortified positions of the 17th Division. By noon, our troops, which had wedged into the enemy's heart, had completely wiped out the 48th Brigade headquarters of the 17th Division, capturing its brigade commander, Wan You'ao, alive. Our army continued to advance deep into the enemy's territory and surrounded its division headquarters and 12th Brigade in Weizhuangzhen. After a part of the enemy was eliminated by us, they took advantage of the darkness to escape that night. Our army tracked them down and quickly expanded the offensive, surrounding the enemy's 38th Division. On the 7th, our army completely annihilated the 177th Brigade of the 38th Division in the Dong, Xi, and Zhonghan Village areas, about 30 li north of Dali, eliminating two full regiments and a part of another regiment, as well as the 38th Division headquarters and a part of the 55th Brigade. The battle was completely resolved before dusk that day. The defeated troops of the 38th Division headquarters and 55th Brigade, and the 17th Division headquarters and 12th Brigade, were scattered and battered by our pursuing troops, suffering extremely heavy casualties. In this encirclement battle, our army annihilated parts of two division headquarters, one brigade headquarters, a part of one brigade headquarters, six full regiments, half of two regiments, a part of one regiment, one regimental headquarters, and another full battalion, totaling more than 16,000 enemy troops killed, wounded, and captured. While this encirclement battle was in progress, in order to rescue the annihilation of its two divisions, the Hu bandits hurriedly drew troops from Yao County, Fuping, Pucheng, Xingping, Tongguan, Baoji, Fengxiang, and other places, adjusting the First Division, 90th Division, 65th Division, 13th Division, 76th Division, and the remnants of the 36th Division, totaling ten main brigades, and gathered in the Dali and Luo River delta area, relying on the Luo River and Dali as a support, and deployed into a 30-li wide square formation, vainly attempting to invade northward. On the 11th, after our forward outposts lured the enemy into the Dongxi Han Village and Haoying area, we launched a full-scale offensive on the 12th. The Northwest enemy army's elite main force, the 65th Division, which considered itself superior to all others, was divided and surrounded by our army in Lijiapo, Dahaoying, Zhonghan Village and other villages and towns, and suffered heavy blows. The entire 560th Regiment of the 187th Brigade and one battalion of the 561st Regiment, stationed in Lijiapo, were completely annihilated by us, with no one escaping. The remaining parts were also heavily bombarded by our brave artillery and dense firepower, suffering heavy casualties. On the 13th, in order to save the decline, the enemy投入 all its troops into the first line, and was痛击 again by our army, inflicting significant damage. In the battle, although the enemy brought the ten main brigades closely together and relied on airplanes and tanks to assist in the battle, they still could not withstand the attack of our army. The enemy's tanks were destroyed, airplanes were shot down, and the troops were severely damaged. The "Central News Agency" has repeatedly called out these days所谓所谓"The invading bandits have entered the pre-arranged decisive battle zone, and we are展开 encirclement." But the facts prove that the精锐部队 that was "encircled" was the Hu bandits' more than 23,000 elite troops.

　　荔北歼敌二万三千大捷经过：
    胡匪十个旅紧靠一起经不起我军强大攻击
    【新华社陕中前线二十二日电】前线记者报导西北人民解放军在大荔以北地区两次歼敌二万三千余名大捷的经过称：八月上旬，我军于黄龙战役中痛歼胡匪三十六师，展开秋季攻势的序幕作战后，胡匪即慌忙地在东起朝邑、西迄＠县一线调整防御部署。一面经由其谣言公司中央社叫嚷什么：“已形成有力部署”、“刻自洛河至黄河边向澄城等地展开扫荡”，以掩盖其失败。我军在一个月的练兵后，首向敌人的精锐部队整十七师与整三十八师发起进击。攻势于六日拂晓在澄城以南之寺前、醍醐、永丰镇间（在澄城南四十华里）约二十余里正面全线展开，连克整十七师之设防阵地十二处，至中午我楔入敌心脏之部队即将整十七师四十八旅旅部全部解决，生俘其旅长万又鏖。我军继续向敌纵深发展，于韦庄镇地包围其师部及十二旅。敌被我解决一部后，当晚趁黑夜脱逃。我军跟踪追击，并迅速扩张攻势，包围敌整三十八师。七日我军即在大荔北约三十里的东、西、中汉村地区，围歼敌整三十八师之一七七旅，消灭其两个整团及另一个团之一部，三十八师师部及五十五旅之一部。战斗于当日黄昏前完全解决。敌整三十八师师部及五十五旅、整十七师师部及十二旅等溃逃部队，为我追军打得七零八落，毙伤极多。此役我军共歼敌两个师部各一部、一个旅部、一个旅部的一部、六个整团、两个团之半数、一个团之一部、一个团部、又一个整营，共毙伤俘敌一万六千余人。在此一围歼战进行之际，胡匪为援救其两个师的覆没，仓皇自耀县、富平、蒲城、兴平、潼关、宝鸡、凤翔等地，抽调整一师、整九十师、整六十五师、整十三师、整七十六师及整三十六师残部，共合十个主力旅的兵力，集结于大荔及洛河三角地带，以洛河及大荔为依托，布置成三十里宽广之方阵，妄图北犯。十一日我前哨警戒部队诱敌进入东西汉村及壕营一带地区后，十二日即全线发起进击。西北敌军自以为高过一切的精锐主力整六十五师两个旅，被我军分割包围于李家坡、大壕营、中汉村等村镇内，受了沉重打击。其住李家坡之一八七旅五六零团一个整团及五六一团之一个整营，为我全歼，无一漏网。其余部分，亦为我神勇炮兵及密集火器轰击，伤亡惨重。十三日敌为挽救颓势，遂将其所有部队投入第一线，又为我军痛击，给予重大杀伤。在战斗中，敌人虽将十个主力旅紧靠在一起，并凭借飞机及坦克助战，仍经不起我军之攻击，敌之坦克被打毁，飞机被击落，部队受重创。“中央社”在这几天里又连日叫喊所谓“犯匪已入我预布决战地带，我正展开围歼中”。但事实证明，被“围歼”的乃是胡匪二万三千余名的精锐部队。
