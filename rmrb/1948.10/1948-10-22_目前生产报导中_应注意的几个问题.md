　　Current Production Reports:
　　Several Issues to Note
　　This Newspaper's Correspondents

　　The autumn harvest and wheat sowing have ended in many areas, and autumn plowing has begun. At the same time, some areas have begun to organize sideline production. In addition to continuing to report on the progress, achievements, and shortcomings of the above production activities, special attention should be paid to summarizing agricultural production over the past year. In the past, we have reported on the production of some typical villages and labor heroes. Now that the autumn harvest is over, it is also urgent to report on their production achievements (results), experiences, and remaining problems.

　　Regarding reporting methods, we have summarized the recent period's agricultural production reports and feel that improvements are needed in the following aspects:

　　I. Use numbers to explain the production situation, such as how many times the land was plowed, how many loads or carts or pack animal loads of manure were applied per mu, etc. At the same time, write down the past figures (such as before the Anti-Japanese War and last year) for comparison, to see if there has been progress and development. Then study the reasons for the progress and development, and point out the direction of future efforts.

　　II. Many correspondents report that a certain district or village has exceeded its original plan for fertilizer accumulation, harvesting, etc., even exceeding it by 200% or 300%. In the future, please explain in detail how the original plan was specifically calculated, and whether the masses think the plan was set high or low, reasonable or unreasonable. Because there are now many reports of completing or exceeding plans ahead of schedule, it is difficult to determine whether the original plan was set too low or whether the work was done well.

　　III. What are the specific different methods of leading production this year compared to leading production in the past? For example, in the use of livestock, the organization of manpower, the mobilization of semi-able-bodied and auxiliary labor, the solution of difficulties for households lacking manpower and livestock, wages, and leadership methods (such as past meetings, reports, plans, and review work, etc.), what are the similarities and differences with last year? What are the different opinions of different classes of people on these methods? What are the results of the implementation? Is it done better, and is everyone satisfied? There are still many manuscripts that only say that the whole village is organized to launch a shock competition, or is organized to formulate a plan, take active action, and complete so much, without explaining how to organize, how to formulate a plan, how to act... Lacking process and unclear appearance, thus weakening the guiding nature of the manuscript.

　　IV. Reporting that a village or a district, after publicizing the Party's policies, the masses are at ease in production, and the cadres are actively leading. For this type of report with propaganda as the theme, it should be explained what was publicized, what meeting format or other methods were used? What are the reactions of all classes? Are there any doubts about getting rich, and how to eliminate them?

　　In short, I hope that everyone will report on the production situation with a research work attitude, and not simply to praise achievements, or simply to criticize shortcomings. We should earnestly think about whether our work this year has improved or improved compared to last year. If it has improved, what are the specific reasons? If it has not improved, what are the reasons? Only in this way can it be helpful and have reference significance for other regions.

### 目前生产报导中　应注意的几个问题

　　目前生产报导中
  　应注意的几个问题
    本报通讯联
    秋收种麦在许多地区已经结束，并开始进行秋耕。与此同时，有些地区已开始组织副业生产。目前除继续报导以上各项生产进行情形与成绩缺点外，特别应注意总结一年来农业生产。过去我们曾报导了一些典型村与劳动英雄的生产情形，现在秋收已过，也急应报导其生产的成绩（结果）、经验与尚存在的问题。
    关于报导方法，我们总结了一下最近时期的农业生产报导，觉得需要从下列几方面改进：
    一、以数目字说明生产情况，如犁地几遍，每亩上粪几担几车或几驮等等，同时写出过去的数字（如抗战以前和去年的），以作比较，看究竟是不是有进步，有发展。然后再研究进步与发展的原因，指出以后努力方向。
    二、不少通讯员报导某区某村积肥、收割………等超过原订计划。甚至超过百分之二百、三百。以后请详细说明原来计划是怎样具体计算的，群众认为这个计划订的高还是低，合理不合理。因为现在有许多提前完成计划或超过计划的报导，很难断定究竟原来计划订的太低，还是工作做得好。
    三、今年领导生产，和过去领导生产有什么具体的不同办法。如在使用牲口上，组织人力上，发动半劳力与辅助劳力上，解决缺乏人畜力户困难问题上，工资上，领导方法上（如过去的会议，汇报，计划与检讨工作等），都与去年有什么相同的，有什么不同的。不同阶层的群众对这些办法有什么不同的意见。执行的结果怎样，是不是做得好些，大家满意不满意。现在还有不少稿子光说全村组织起来突击竞赛，或是组织起来订出计划，积极行动，完成了多少多少，并没说明怎样组织，怎样订计划，怎样行动………缺少过程，面貌不清，因之减弱了稿件的指导性。
    四、报导一个村或一个区经过宣传党的政策，群众安心生产，干部积极领导。这种以宣传为主题的报导，应说明宣传了些什么，用的什么会议形式或是其他办法？各阶层有何反映？对发家致富还有什么疑虑没有，需要怎样消除？
    总之，希望大家在报导生产情况时用研究工作的态度来报导，而不要单纯为了表扬成绩，或单纯的批评缺点，应该切实想想咱们今年的工作比去年有没有进步，有没有提高。如果提高了，具体的原因是什么？如果没有提高，原因又是什么？这样才能对别的地区有帮助，有参考意义。
