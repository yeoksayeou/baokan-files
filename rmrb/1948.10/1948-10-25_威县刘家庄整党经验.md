The Party Rectification Experience of Liujiazhuang Village, Wei County

Liujiazhuang is a small village in the Sixth District of Wei County, with a total of 78 households and 292 people, owning over 1,300 mu of land (plus 500 mu obtained from other villages during the movement). The land is more concentrated compared to surrounding villages. Due to the rule of landlords, the hired poor peasants lived a hard life, mostly relying on firing and selling earthenware pots, and doing odd jobs for landlords to make a living.

The Liu and Yin families are the major families in the village. The Liu family mostly hired poor peasants, while among the 17 households of the Yin family, 8 were landlords (4 before the movement), 5 were rich peasants (1 before the movement), and 4 were ordinary peasants. Yin Tongshan (deceased), the head of the Yin family landlords, was the historical ruler of the village. He served as a patrol officer before the War of Resistance against Japan and as the chief of the major village for the enemy after Wei County was occupied by the enemy. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the village government was always in the hands of landlords. The land of the Yin family landlords and rich peasants once reached 1,200 mu.

The branch was established in 1938. At that time, Wei County was occupied by the enemy, and the puppet army of Shi Yousan also caused trouble in nearby villages. The branch had a total of six members, with Liu Xinzhai as the branch secretary. Initially, the branch's work was to send intelligence to our government and organize a communication network. Later, because the enemy established a stronghold in賀釗镇贺钊镇 (Hezhao Town), three miles away, they were afraid of exposing their secrets and dared not carry out activities. After liberation, the branch leadership carried out struggles to increase rent and reduce interest and the land reform after the "May 4th" directive, and feudalism was eliminated relatively thoroughly. Liu Xinzhai was removed from his post for being selfish in reversing land distribution, and Liu Yuelin took over as branch secretary. After the "May 4th" land reform movement, the number of party members increased to thirteen (with three others expelled). After Liu Quanlu and Liu Yuelin joined the army in the autumn of 1947, Liu Kuilin became the branch secretary.

During the movement, individual party members shielded landlords. For example, Liu Zhulin was bought by the small favors of the landlord and shielded the landlord Yin Laotai, pleaded for the landlord, and left more things for the landlord. Zhao Wenqi led the struggle more firmly, but when it came to his former landlord's steward, he showed consideration and left good houses. Cadres used coercive orders and were undemocratic in their work style, and their attitude towards the masses was not good, showing off their power. Village chief Liu Baohe, branch secretary Liu Yuelin, and militia instructor Sun Qiyi often strutted on the streets with pistols, which the masses were very dissatisfied with, but no one dared to speak out.

(I) Preparatory Work in Party Rectification

(1) After a preliminary investigation of the village situation, the branch held a general meeting. Through branch party rectification, the spirit of the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region's Letter to Party Members was explained to the party members. Combined with the specific situation of the village, it was pointed out that not caring about the hired poor peasants meant that the class viewpoint was not clear, and that one could not be considered a good communist party member. For example, the poor peasant old man Liu Yougang lived in the doorway in winter and no one cared, while party members Wenqi and Quanlu had their own houses but lived in the agricultural association's brick house. The party members were repeatedly educated that "knowing and correcting mistakes is the way out," and good party members were called upon to use criticism and self-criticism to carry out ideological struggle against bad party members who were unwilling to correct their mistakes.

(2) Individual talks and collection of materials. The leadership divided the work and conducted talks with each party member about their personal history, motives for joining the party, working hours in the village, and distribution of fruits, and also conducted individual understanding of each party member among the masses.

(3) Select and unite the activists and better elements of the branch to be the backbone of party rectification. After understanding the party members separately inside and outside the party, the current branch secretary Liu Kuilin (an old party member, from a poor peasant background, because he likes to speak the truth, the party members in power said that he was "stubborn" and did not adopt his opinions. Today it proves that he insisted on the truth on the side of the masses in the past, and the masses said that he was an honest man who dared to speak the truth.), Liu Quanfu (a young and honest, militia captain) and Liu Yunzhao (director of the Farmers' Association) were proposed as temporary branch committee members, relying on them as activists in the party rectification, relying on them to take the lead as the backbone, so that the less mistaken people could lean on them, forming the core force in the party rectification, and also cultivating the branch foundation after the party rectification.

(4) Ideological mobilization. A branch meeting was held to carry out ideological mobilization, mobilizing everyone to speak out about any grievances in the past within the "internal" (the masses called the branch the "internal"). Everyone should thoroughly criticize the mistakes of others and their own mistakes, not caring about face, or relatives, and not allowing retaliation. Those who made mistakes were afraid of not correcting them, and correcting mistakes made them good party members and good long-term workers for the people.

(5) In terms of methods, on the one hand, mobilize the masses, and on the other hand, the branch rectifies the party, and the masses and the branch cooperate with each other, so that the party rectification is combined with the masses. Every night, the working comrades of the two sides study the work of the two sides on that day, and put forward materials to obtain cooperation. Before each party rectification meeting, the core members are consulted in detail, the methods and steps are studied, and their thoughts are unblocked, and the leaders are enlightened and organized. First, let those who make fewer mistakes reflect, and after criticism, they admit it. Sharp criticism and struggle against those who do not admit their mistakes, seriously infringe on the interests of the masses, embezzlers, and shielders of landlords and rich peasants. After these two parts of people's mistakes are cleared and resolved, the entire branch is concentrated to clean up class dissidents. At the same time, use group meetings and individual talks to unblock thoughts, and stop meetings when necessary to conduct investigations and research.

(6) Branch Party Rectification. During the nine days of party rectification in the branch, after self-reflection, mutual criticism, and individual talks to unblock thoughts, most of the party members exposed their mistakes, and the root causes were "chopped out" (criticism, they called it "chopping"). After each party member recognized the harm of their mistakes, they were considered to have been reviewed in the branch. During the branch party rectification, they encouraged each other with sincere attitudes. For example, Liu Fanglin (a cadre) said to everyone after reflecting on himself: "Everyone, please pack my luggage for me ('luggage' refers to the baggage of mistakes), so that I can pass cleanly." Sharp criticism was launched against Liu Zhulin and Sun Qiyi, who did not admit their mistakes. For example, Sun Qiyi reflected and said: "The militia puts up planks on the roof, shouting to quiet the street, 'whoever goes out will be beaten to death for nothing.' This is not my mistake, it is an order from above." Party member ×× said: "You say it is an order from above, why was branch secretary Liu Yuelin criticized when he went to the district to attend a meeting?" Liu ×× said: "You twisted the order from above. The superior's instruction to put up planks was for standing guard on the roof when something happened in the village. You run on the roof day and night, and men and women are suffocated in the house in the hot weather, unable to go out. You run around on the roof day and night." In short, during the branch party rectification, each party member made suggestions to each other and launched an ideological struggle against those who did not admit their mistakes.

(7) Clarify right and wrong, severity and importance, and treat them differently. A branch meeting was held to discuss the spirit of party rectification, explaining that party rectification is to reorganize the party ranks, to handle affairs democratically, fairly and reasonably in the future, and to be democratic both inside and outside the party. Whoever is wrong is wrong, and the responsibility should be clarified. When the opinions of the masses are incorrect, party members can disagree and have the right to defend themselves, and the leadership will not blindly listen to the wrong opinions of the masses. The conditions for party members and the role they should play were discussed, and the enthusiasm of the party members was high. Liu Zhulin said on the spot: "I have been in a lot of pain in the past few days. I feel that the mistakes I have made are not small, and the party must not want me. Thinking of this, I just 'laid down' (meaning to lie down). After listening to everyone's discussion this time, I understand that everyone is kindly persuading us to walk on the right path! If someone raises things that are unfounded, we can also speak up to correct them. I am determined to reflect on and correct the mistakes I have made in the past."

(II) Mass Representatives Attend the Branch Party Rectification Meeting

After the party members and the masses have made ideological preparations, a branch meeting will be held, with one or two representatives from each group of middle and poor peasants, totaling more than 20 male and female representatives, bringing the opinions of the group to participate in the official party rectification meeting (the list will be announced the day before reviewing each party member, so that the mass groups can discuss the specific mistakes, work style, position, and thoughts of the party members, and submit them to the representatives at the meeting). Because the masses have improved their class consciousness more than before after the prior preparation work and this deliberation and discussion, they also have a preliminary understanding of the relationship between party members and the masses. When the mass representatives make suggestions to each party member, they are calm and without any radical emotions, but the struggle against the mistakes of the party members is very serious and not relaxed at all. For example, after Liu Zhulin reflected on his unstable position and shielding the landlord, a poor peasant representative ×× said: "Your relationship with the landlord has been clarified since the last party rectification, but you can't see the poor peasants, you haven't reflected on it. For example, in mobilizing conscription comfort money, the landlord can take less casually, and the poor peasants have to take at least 6,000 yuan. Liu ××, if you don't have money, you ask people to sell urns. You have to review these carefully." Liu ×× said: "We are making these suggestions for your own good, just like when we produce pots on the kiln, we pick out the good ones, and the flawed ones can still be used after patching. We only throw away the ones that can't be repaired. Who would be willing to throw away a good pot that can be repaired." The relationship between the party and the masses was naturally close at the meeting. For example, party member Liu Kuilin said: "This time everyone helped me correct my mistakes, and I will often ask for criticism in the future." ××× said: "Party members are like bright lights in the dark, leading us to a good path. If the lampshade is black, wipe it, and add oil if there is no oil, but don't let it be smoked." After five days of meetings, all party members were reviewed.

(III) Discuss the Punishment of Party Members and Re-elect Branch Committee Members

After discussion by the branch on the mistakes of each party member, with the approval of the higher authorities, it was announced at a branch meeting attended by the masses. Among the 12 party members in the village, 6 party members reflected well and the mistakes were small, and the discussion result was that they should not be punished. One person was given a warning punishment, four people were placed on probation within the party (one of whom was already on probation in the past), and one person was expelled. (Out of a total of 12 party members in the village, 1/2 were subject to disciplinary action, and the nature of these people's mistakes was not explained, whether they were conscious or unconscious, accidental or consistent, which is worth reviewing. In the party rectification, we should basically adopt a realistic, truth-seeking, cure-illness-save-people attitude, and use the method of criticism and self-criticism to carry out education, unblock thinking, and overcome shortcomings, in order to improve the consciousness and discipline of party members and cadres. Disciplinary sanctions should only be an auxiliary means, and we cannot rely on punishment to solve all problems. - Editor)

On the evening of April 27, a party member meeting was held, with poor peasant representatives attending as observers. First, the tasks of the branch, the rights and obligations of party members, and the discipline within the party were explained. After a short period of deliberation, a secret ballot election was held. As a result of the election, Liu Kuilin was elected as the branch secretary, and Liu Yunzhao and Liu Yunrui were elected as branch committee members.

(IV) After the Party Rectification, the Party's Prestige Has Been Improved

After the party rectification, the mass organizations were reorganized, and a new Farmers' Association was established. First, after group discussions, the conditions for candidates for the Farmers' Association Committee were proposed: (1) selfless and impartial. (2) Enthusiastic about serving the masses. (3) Hardworking and suffering people. Then, the groups discussed and deliberated, and three or five people gathered on the street to talk about who should be elected as the chairman and cadres. Liu ×× said: "In the past, the election of cadres was to catch the big head, and if we saw who was behind, we would put a 'head' on him to make it difficult for him. This time, we can't mess around, we have to carefully consider it..." After two days of deliberation and discussion, a general meeting of members was held for voting. Liu Kuilin was elected as the chairman of the Farmers' Association with a unanimous vote, Liu Yunzhao was elected as a member of the Farmers' Association and deputy village chief, Liu Quanfu was elected as the militia captain, and Zou Qingxiang was elected as the deputy of the self-defense team. Party members accounted for half of the total number of committee members. Sun ×× said on the spot: "Work hard, it doesn't matter. If you can't help with anything else in the future, you can just tell us if you need errands." Liu ×× said: "This is different from before. Everyone will help with things in the future, and I will help with writing and calculations." Many people expressed on the spot that they would definitely help the cadres work and obey the leadership of the cadres in the future. This boosted the cadres' courage to work, so none of the nine cadres elected were not actively working. For example, this time when collecting summer public grain (the working group has left the village), they made careful plans and division of labor in advance (weighing, looking at accounts, inspecting wheat). The grain collection was done in an orderly manner, and the entire village completed the task in half a day. The surplus of more than 100 kilograms of wheat was discussed and handled by the masses. The masses reflected that "This time it's really neat, and the procedures are clear."

　　威县刘家庄整党经验
    刘家庄是威县六区一个小村，共七十八户二百九十二人，有土地一千三百余亩（另外运动中分到外村五百亩）土地较周围村庄集中，由于地主的统治，雇贫农生活很苦，大部依靠烧瓦盆，卖瓦盆给地主捎脚扛活，来维持生活。
    全村刘姓尹姓为大户。刘姓多是雇贫，尹姓十七户中有八户地主（运动前为四户），五户富农（运动前为一户），四户普通农民。尹姓地主为首的尹桐山（已死）是该村历史上的统治人物，抗战前当过巡官，敌占威县后又当过敌人大乡长，八年抗战中，村政权一直握在地主手中，尹姓地富的土地曾到过一千二百亩。
    支部建立在一九三八年。那时敌占威县，伪军石友三部也在附近村庄捣乱，当时支部共六人，由刘信斋任支部书记，开始支部工作是给我政府送情报，组织通讯网，后因敌人在距三里路的贺钊镇按据点，怕暴露了秘密不敢活动了。解放后，支部领导进行了增资倒佃和“五四”指示后的土改斗争，封建消灭较彻底。刘信斋因倒地自私，被撤职，由刘月林任支书，经过“五四”土改运动，党员发展到十三人（另外开除了三人），一九四七年秋刘全路、刘月林参军走后由刘奎林担任支书。
    在运动中，有个别党员给地主打掩护，如刘竹林受了地主小恩小惠的收买，包庇地主尹老太，替地主讲情，给地主多留东西，赵文起领导斗争较坚决，但斗到他过去的地主掌柜时，就看面子，留好房子。干部在作风上强迫命令不民主，对群众说话态度不好，耍厉害。村长刘保和，支书刘月林，民兵指导员孙启义，时常挎着手枪在街上抖威风，群众对这很不满意，但谁也不敢说话。
    （一）整党工作中的准备工作
    （１）村中情况经过初步调查后，即召开支部大会，经过支部整党，给党员讲解晋冀鲁豫中央局告党员书的精神，结合本村具体情况，指明对雇贫不关心，就是阶级观点不明确，就不能算是好共产党员的态度。如贫农老汉刘有刚，冬天住在大门道里没人管，而党员文起、全路自己有房子不住，却住在农会的大砖房里。并反复教育党员“知错改错才是出路”，号召好党员以批评与自我批评的方法，向不愿改错的坏党员作思想斗争。
    （２）个别谈话，搜集材料。领导上分工，和每个党员进行了个人历史，入党动机，在村工作时间，分果实情形的谈话，并在群众中对每个党员作了个别了解。
    （３）选择与团结支部的积极分子和较好分子做整党骨干。对党员经过党内外的分别了解之后，提出现任支书刘奎林（老党员，贫农出身，他因好说真理，党内当权的党员说他是“扛死杠”，不采纳他的意见，今日证明他过去所谓“扛死杠”的事，他都是站在群众方面坚持真理的，群众都说他是敢说理的老实人。）刘全福（青年老实，民兵队长）刘云召（农会主任）三人为临时支部支委，依靠他们作为整党中的积极分子，依靠他们带头作骨干，使错误小的向他们靠拢，形成整党中的核心力量，同时也培养了整党后的支部基础。
    （４）思想动员。召开支部会议，进行思想动员，动员大家过去在内部（群众叫支部叫内部）有什么不平的事都讲出来，对别人的错误，对自己的错误，都要彻底批评，不能顾面子，讲亲家，不准报复，犯了错就怕不改，改正了错误就是好党员，人民大众的好长工。
    （５）在方式上一方面发动群众，一方面支部整党，群众和支部双方取得配合，使整党结合群众，每晚两方工作同志在一起研究当日双方工作，并提出材料，取得配合，每当整党会议进行前，预先找核心分子详细商量，研究办法及步骤，并打通他们的思想，启发与组织带头的，先让错少的反省，经过批评，承认了事。向不承认错误的严重侵犯群众利益的分子，贪污分子，包庇地富分子，进行尖锐地批评和斗争。这两部分人的错误清算解决后，则集中全支部力量清洗阶级异己分子。同时以小组会，个别谈话打通思想，必要时停止开会进行调查研究工作。
    （６）支部整党。在支部九天整党中，经过自己反省互相批评，个别谈话打通思想，多数党员都暴露出自己的错误，批砍（批判，他们叫批砍）出病根来，每个党员对自己的错误认清害处后，就算在支部中审查过了，在支部整党中，他们都以诚心的态度互相勉励着，如刘仿林（干部）自己反省后，他向大家说：“大家都给我收拾收拾行李，（‘行李’指的是错误包袱）好叫我干干净净的过去。”对不认错的刘竹林、孙启义展开了尖锐的批评，如孙启义反省说：“民兵上房搭跳板，喊静街‘谁出门打死白打。’这不是我的错误，是上头命令。”党员××说：“你说是上头命令，为啥支书刘月林去区上开会，还受了批评？”刘××说：“你把上头命令行歪了，上级让跳板是村里有了事上房站岗用的，你们成天黑夜在房上跑，大热天男的女的都闷到屋里，不能出门，你们成天黑夜在房上乱串。”总之，在支部整党中，每个党员都相互提了意见，向不承认错误者展开思想斗争。
    （７）弄清是非轻重，分别对待。召开支部大会，讨论整党精神，说明整党是为了整理好党的队伍，往后办事民主，公平合理，党内外都要民主，谁的错就是谁的错，是非责任应分清，群众提的意见不对时，党员可不同意，有申辩权利，领导上也不会盲目听信群众错误意见。并讨论了党员条件，和应起的作用，党员情绪就高涨了，当场刘竹林说：“几天来我心里很苦闷，觉得自己犯的错不小，党一定不要自己了，想到这里我就弄了堆（躺倒之意），听了这回大家讨论，我可明白了，大家是好心好意劝咱往正道上走哩！有人提了没影子的事，咱也能说话纠正。过去犯的错误，我决心好好反省改正。”
    （二）群众代表列席支部整党会议
    党员群众双方作了思想准备之后，即召开支部会，中贫农每组选一人至二人为代表，共男女代表二十余人，携带小组意见参加正式整党会议（在审查每一个党员的前一天即宣布名单，让群众小组讨论，党员的具体错误、工作作风、立场、思想，交给代表在会上提出）。由于群众经过事先的准备工作，和这次的酝酿讨论，阶级觉悟较前提高，对党员和群众的关系也有了初步的认识。群众代表对每个党员提意见时，心平气和毫无一点偏激的情绪，但对党员的错误斗争很严肃，一点也不放松。例如：刘竹林反省了自己立场不稳，给地主打掩护后，贫民代表××说：“从上回整党后你和地主的关系是划清了，就是你望不见贫民，你没反省，比如：动员参军慰劳款吧，地主可以随便少拿，贫民至少就拿六千元，刘××没钱你叫人家卖瓮吧，你这些可要好好检讨检讨。”刘××发言说：“咱提这意见都是为你好，好比咱们窑上出盆，好的拣出来，有毛病的糊糊也能用，实在补不好哩才扔了，好盆能补好哩谁舍得扔掉。”会上党群关系很自然的密切起来，如党员刘奎林说：“这回大家帮助我改了错，往后可要经常提出批评。”×××发言说：“党员比如黑夜的明灯，领俺们往好路上走，灯罩黑了就擦，没油添油，可不能叫烟熏了。”经过五天的会议，全部党员都审查了一遍。
    （三）讨论党员的处分，改选支部委员
    支部对每个党员的错误经过讨论，经上级批准，在群众参加的支部大会上宣布，全村党员十二人，有六个党员反省好错误也小，讨论结果是不应受处分。其它警告处分者一人，留党察看者四人（其中一人过去即是留党察看），开除一人。（全村党员共十二人，受纪律处分者占二分之一，而又未说明这些人错误的性质，是自觉的还是不自觉的，偶然的还是一贯的，值得检讨。整党中，基本上应以实事求是治病救人的态度，以批评与自我批评的方法，进行教育，打通思想克服缺点，以提高党员干部的自觉性与纪律性。纪律制裁，仅仅应该是辅助的手段，不能靠处分解决一切问题。——编者）
    四月二十七日晚上召开党员大会，由贫农代表列席旁听，首先讲解了支部任务、党员权利和义务、党内的纪律。经过短期间的酝酿后，即召开不记名投票选举，选举结果，刘奎林当选为支书，刘云召、刘云瑞为支部委员。
    （四）经过整党后，党的威信是提高了
    整党结束后即整顿群众组织，成立新农会，首先经小组讨论，提出农会委员候选人条件：（一）大公无私。（二）热心为群众办事。（三）辛勤劳动的受苦人。然后各小组讨论酝酿，在街头三、五人一起谈论着选谁当主席当干部，刘××说：“以前选干部是捉大头，看谁落后就往他身上格个头，让他作难，这回选举可不能瞎闹，可得老实斟酌斟酌…………。”经过两天的酝酿讨论后，召开全体会员大会进行票选，刘奎林以全票当选为农会主席，刘云召当选为农会委员兼副村长，刘全福当选为民兵队长，邹庆祥当选为自卫队副，党员占全体委员的半数，当场孙××说：“好好干吧，没要紧，往后别的不能帮忙有跑腿的事你就说话。”刘××说：“这和以前不一样，往后有事大家都帮忙，写写算算我来帮助。”很多人当场表示今后一定帮助干部工作，服从干部领导。这样鼓起了干部的工作勇气，所以选举的九个干部中没有一个不积极工作的。例如，这次征收夏季公粮（工作组已离村），他们事先做了周密的计划和分工（过秤、看帐、检验麦子），收粮时搞的很有秩序，全村半天的时间就全部完成任务。把长余的百余斤麦子让群众讨论处理，群众反映说：“这回真利落，手续又清楚。”
