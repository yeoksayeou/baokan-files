Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 20th: The powerful second-line corps of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's second phase, having completed new-style training, are now swearing an oath one after another and heading to the front. This new force, formed as early as this spring, has been trained based on summarizing the rich training experience of the first-phase second-line corps. They have received in-depth political education and practical military coaching, and are generally proficient in modern combat techniques. They include a large number of outstanding marksmen, grenade throwers, and demolition experts. They are not only proficient in technology but also familiar with the various current policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Their members are abundant, and their morale is high. When news of the victory on the Beining Line arrived, various units submitted letters of determination and guarantees to their superiors, requesting to be sent to the front as soon as possible. After receiving permission, a certain unit quickly assembled and boarded the train in the drizzling rain to start their journey. Soldiers in the carriages discussed how to defeat the enemy and win merits. Before departure, a certain unit held a military test, and × hundred outstanding experts were commended, and × units were collectively awarded. When another unit departed, party and government officials from the station and thousands of local citizens gathered at the station to send them off, with applause and cheers resounding through the sky, shouting to emulate the East China Liberation Army who "captured Jinan and captured Wang Yaowu alive." As the train slowly pulled out of the station, the brave soldiers extended tens of thousands of hands from the train windows to say goodbye: "We will definitely bring back good news of our merits soon," "We will fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive."
