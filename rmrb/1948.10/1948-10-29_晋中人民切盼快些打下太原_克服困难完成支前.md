[Jinzhong Electric] In order to support the frontlines in capturing Taiyuan quickly, many model figures have emerged in Shouyang. They find ways to overcome difficulties and complete their frontline support tasks in a timely manner. For example, Wang Yuming, the leader of the large cart team in the ninth district, led his carts to Yishanzhuang village, which only had two or three households and no firewood. Comrade Wang Yuming mobilized everyone to cut firewood, and in just over two hours, they cut 500 jin of grass and collected 400 jin of firewood, solving the problem of firewood shortage for the civilian laborers. In the fifth district’s donkey cart team, on the 11th, in Yuci Chengguan, the Taihang grain coupons could not be exchanged, and the civilian laborers and donkeys had nothing to eat. It was raining and everyone was hungry. Squad leader Yin Shibao said: "We must reach our destination even if we are hungry. This is for supporting the front and fighting Taiyuan, it's only this time, when else will we fight?" Under his leadership and encouragement, everyone resolutely completed the task. In the seventh district, two carts in the third large cart team broke down at Longmen River. Team leader Hao Dean personally borrowed two carts from the villagers, ensuring transportation. On the 13th, when the carts returned to Jiaocheng, Hao Dean found that seven carts were damaged. He immediately convened a meeting of squad leaders and platoon leaders to study and decide that the carts should stop but the horses should not. The oxen from the broken carts were taken out and hitched in pairs to the working carts, which allowed them to pull more things, so the transportation was not affected. This spirit of actively leading civilian laborers, overcoming difficulties, and completing tasks is worthy of emulation by comrades in transportation teams everywhere. (Zheng Bang)
[Jinzhong Electric] The broad masses of women in the Jinzhong area are enthusiastically supporting the front by going to the fields to harvest crops, grind rice, and mill flour, and undertake rear transportation. Liu Wanzhen, Guo Siying, and Liu Yongchan, female party members in Xiazhuang Village, tenth district of Wutai, led eighteen women to harvest 25 mu of millet for five military families and civilian laborers. Female party members of Qitu Village took the lead in organizing an autumn harvest assault team, which, in addition to harvesting autumn crops for the families of military personnel and martyrs, also sewed and mended clothes for civilian laborers. In the third district of Pingding, 1,372 women voluntarily participated in the labor exchange groups to go to the fields and harvest autumn crops. Zhang Shunhua, chairman of the women's federation of Fei Village in the district, said: "We longed for the daytime and longed for the nighttime, and today we have finally longed for the attack on Taiyuan. The men are going to war, and our production in the rear is the same as attacking Taiyuan." Women, children, and old men in the fifth district of Dingxiang milled rice day and night, completing 86,000 jin in one day. In seventeen villages of Pingyao, more than 2,700 women organized themselves to grind flour for the troops. In Zhudujiazhuang alone, 4,700 jin of white flour were ground in four days. In order to supply the frontline troops with grain and white flour in a timely manner, the broad masses of women participated in short-distance transportation in the rear. In the second district of Shouyang, forty-six women and fourteen children transported 1,000 jin of wheat to the troops from more than ten miles away at one time, and immediately ground it into white flour. Under the leadership of activist Shi Yueying, women in Songbi Village transported frontline support materials. Ji Yue'e, Li Yulan, Hao Shouhua, and others in Longtou Village sent sleepers to the station more than ten miles away. In the fifth district of Shouyang, more than 100 women participated in railway construction.

　　晋中人民切盼快些打下太原
  　克服困难完成支前
    【晋中电】为了支援前线快些打下太原，寿阳涌出了不少的模范人物，他们想办法克服困难，及时完成了支前任务。如九区大车连长王玉明，带领大车到一山庄村，只有两三户人家，没有柴草。王玉明同志发动大家割柴火，仅两点多钟就割下草五百斤，拾柴火四百斤解决了民工烧柴困难。五区毛驴连，十一号在榆次城关因太行粮票不能兑，民工毛驴都没吃的，天又下雨肚子饿，班长尹石保说：饿肚也得到达目的地，为了支前打太原，就这一次，啥时还打哩？在他带领推动下，全体坚决完成了任务。七区大车第三连在陇门河坏了大车二辆，连长郝德安亲到老乡家借出大车二辆，保证了运输。十三日车回到交城，郝德安检查出有七辆大车坏了，马上召开班长排长会议，研究决定车停马不停，将坏车的牛抽出来单套改为二套，能多拉东西，因之运输未曾受到影响。这种积极主动领导民工，克服困难完成任务的精神，是值得各地运输队同志学习的。（政邦）
    【晋中电】晋中区广大妇女，下地秋收碾米磨面，担负后方运输热烈支前。五台十区下庄村妇女党员刘完贞、郭四英、刘永蝉带动了十八个妇女，给五户军属及民工收割糜谷二十五亩。七图村女党员带头组织成的秋收突击队，除给军工烈属收秋外，并给民工缝补衣服。平定三区有一千三百七十二个妇女，自愿参加到变工组中下地收秋，该区斐村妇联主席张顺花说：“白天盼黑夜盼，今天才盼到打太原，男人去参战，咱们在后方生产也和打太原一样。”定襄五区妇女儿童老汉日夜碾米，一天就完成八万六千斤。平遥十七个村，有二千七百余妇女组织起来给部队磨面。只杜家庄，在四天内就磨下四千七百斤白面。为着及时供给前方部队食粮白面，广大妇女参加后方短距离运输；寿阳二区四十六个妇女十四个儿童，一次从十里以外给部队运回麦子一千斤，马上磨成白面。宋壁村妇女在积极分子史月英带领下输送支前器材，龙头村冀月娥、李玉兰、郝守花等，往十里以外的车站送道木，寿阳五区有一百多妇女参加修铁路。
