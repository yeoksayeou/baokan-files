Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd—Some areas of Northern Manchuria are paying attention to seed selection during the autumn harvest. The Northeast Farm in Suileng County, Heilongjiang Province, planted 70 hectares of rice fields with specially selected "Red芒 Rice," which is cold-resistant, early-maturing, and has plump grains, yielding 20 shi per hectare. The Provincial Department of Agriculture plans to reserve all the rice from this farm as seeds for promotion throughout the province next year. The Hejiang Provincial Government recently issued instructions to organize the selection, collection, and exhibition of production samples, requiring governments at all levels to implement them conscientiously. Any good varieties should be exchanged and adjusted by village or district units, so that good varieties are not wasted and are beneficial for promotion next year. Farmers in the Mongol 力 District of Huachuan County planted "Yongjie" and "Lanshou" wheat this year, with the highest yield reaching 3 shi per hectare and the lowest being 2 shi and 5 dou (70 jin per dou). This type of wheat has full and solid grains, produces more flour, and is not susceptible to blight. In order to popularize this excellent variety throughout the district, the district has begun to carry out exchanges. It is expected that 405 hectares can be sown next year, and the district can fully sow this excellent variety within two years. In order to promote it more widely, the county government has decided to allocate 2,400 jin to other districts in the county.

　　北满部分地区在秋收中选种
    【新华社东北二日电】北满部分地区在秋收中注意选种。黑龙江省绥棱县东北农场七十垧稻田，种了经过特选的“红芒稻”，耐冷早熟，颗粒丰满，每垧可打二十石。该省农业厅拟将该场全部稻子留作种子，以便明年在全省推广。合江省府日前发出组织选种收集生产展览品指示，要各级政府认真执行。凡有好品种者应以屯或区为单位组织串换调剂，使好品种不致浪费，利于明年推广。桦川县蒙古力区农民今年种“勇捷”“兰寿”两种小麦，最高产量每垧达三石，最低者也有二石五斗（每斗七十斤）。此种麦子，麦粒长得实成，可多出面，且不受疸害。该区为使此优良品种普及全区，已开始进行串换。预计明年可播种四百零五垧，两年内该区可全部播种此优良品种。该县县府为更广泛推广，决定以二千四百斤分配全县其他各区。
