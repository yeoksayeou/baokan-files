　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 28th: TASS reports: The 30th anniversary of the founding of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (YLCL) is approaching at the end of this month. The Central Committee of the YCL is receiving dozens of congratulatory telegrams every day from young people around the world who are fighting for freedom and democracy. All Soviet youth are greeting this glorious festival with greater efforts at their work posts. Nine thousand youth teams working in factories, mines, and railways have completed their annual production plans. In Ukraine, 600,000 YCL members are participating in the socialist competition to commemorate this festival. At a recent plenary session, the Central Committee of the YCL decided to convene the 11th Congress on February 24th next year. The entire meeting, on behalf of all male and female members, wrote a letter to Stalin guaranteeing that Soviet youth would bring joy to their great motherland with new labor achievements, with new achievements in mastering advanced science, technology, and culture, and with new achievements in further improving the work of communist training for young people.
    The Chairman of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, Voinova, stated: Before World War II and during the Patriotic War, Soviet youth always stood at the forefront of the world's anti-fascist struggle. Now, in the struggle for peace and against the instigators of a new war, Soviet youth and its vanguard—the YCL—are also standing at the forefront of the world's democratic youth. Soviet youth have made great contributions to the formation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) and the International Union of Students (IUS). 25 million young men and women throughout the Soviet Union have joined the WFDY, making it a powerful, progressive international democratic youth organization that defends the interests of the younger generation.

　　全苏青年奋力工作迎接少共三十周年
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社讯：苏联共产主义青年团成立三十周年的纪念日即将于本月底来临。团中央委员会每天收到几十件来自世界各国为自由与民主而斗争的青年的贺电。全苏青年正以在工作岗位上的更大努力来迎接这个光辉的节日。在工厂、矿山、铁路等处工作的九千个青年队，已完成一年生产计划。在乌克兰，有六十万共产主义青年团团员参加纪念这个节日的社会主义竞赛。团中央委员会在最近举行的全体会议上，决定于明年二月二十四日召开第十一次代表大会。全会代表全体男女团员，写信向斯大林保证：苏维埃青年将用新的劳动业绩，将用在精通进步的科学、技术、文化上的新成就，在进一步改进对青年的共产主义训练之工作上的新成就，给他们伟大的祖国带来欢欣愉快。
    苏联青年反法西斯委员会主席伏伊诺瓦称：苏联青年在第二次世界大战以前及爱国战争期中，一直站在全世界反法西斯斗争的最前列。现在，在争取和平、反对新战争挑拨者的斗争中，苏联青年及其先锋队——共产主义青年团也同样站在世界民主青年的最前列。苏联青年对组成世界民主青年联盟及国际学生联合会的贡献极大。全苏有二千五百万男女青年参加了世界民主青年联盟，使它成为强有力的、保卫青年一代利益的、进步的国际民主青年组织。
