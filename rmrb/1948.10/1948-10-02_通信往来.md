　　Communication and Exchange (No. 11)
    To comrades of correspondents from various industrial and commercial enterprises and urban factories and stores:
    We hope to quickly receive reports on the construction of industry and commerce in various cities. According to Chairman Mao's policy of "considering both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, developing production, and promoting economic prosperity" and the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, please conduct investigations and research, and introduce the experiences, achievements, difficulties, creations, and mass activities in various aspects with concrete facts. At the same time, please also pay attention to whether there are any errors of agricultural socialist thought and capitalist tendencies. Are there any private industrialists and merchants misinterpreting government policies, arbitrarily infringing upon the legitimate rights of workers, and violating government laws and regulations? If so, please conduct criticism and exposure based on the spirit of the Xinhua News Agency's short commentary on September 24th.

　　通信往来（第十一号）
    各工商企业部门、城市工厂、商店通讯员同志：
    希望迅速报导各城市工商业建设情形。根据毛主席“公私兼顾，劳资两利，发展生产，繁荣经济”的方针与华北工商会议的精神调查研究，把各方面的经验、成绩、困难、创造和群众活动，用具体事实介绍出来，同时并请注意有无农业社会主义思想及资本主义路线的错误偏向。是否有私营工商业主曲解政府政策，任意侵犯工人正当权利和违犯政府法令的行为？如有可根据本报九月二十四日新华社短评的精神进行批判和发揭。
