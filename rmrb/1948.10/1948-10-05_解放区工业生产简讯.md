Brief News on Industrial Production in Liberated Areas
(Xinhua News Agency)

(1) Since the establishment of the Military Region Quartermaster Department in June, the military supplies production units in the Northeast have seen significant improvements in production under unified and centralized leadership. Within several dozen days, the bureaus have completed 75% of the total task for cotton-padded clothing. Among them, the Second, Third, and Fourth Bureaus have even exceeded their tasks. The bureaus have also completed 77% of the total task for military shoe production. In terms of quality, the First Bureau has already reached the specified standards. At one factory of the Third Bureau, the proportion of products meeting standards has also increased to 99%. The First, Third, and Fourth Bureaus have collectively saved 486,400 square feet of fabric in the past two months.

(2) After a certain public factory in Jin-Sui established a quality rating system, workers actively improved their techniques. Fitter Li Wenfu and others made a new set of tools, which reduced the manufacturing of certain parts by two steps, and reduced the waste from 12% to 2%. In the past, it took a skilled worker half an hour to mill a gear. After worker Zhu Dingming modified a set of gear milling tools, two apprentices could complete it in six minutes.

(3) In July, the Central China Public Da Zhong Textile Factory implemented a new wage system. The wages for those paid on a monthly basis were determined by classifying and cross-referencing grades for technicians, skilled workers, semi-skilled workers, and apprentice workers. The wages for those paid by piece were determined by classifying quality into A, B, C, and D grades. After implementation, in July, special and first-class towels accounted for 88% of the total output in the towel workshop, compared to 84% in June. In the weaving workshop, special and first-class cloth accounted for 97% of the total output in July, compared to 92% in June. Output generally exceeded the original plan. After their wages were determined according to their skills, five apprentices in the towel workshop who had not yet reached three years of service were rated as first-class workers.

(4) The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government is promoting newly manufactured small carts through loans, sales, or leases. This type of small cart is modified based on the carts of the North China Plain, and its characteristic is that it can also pass through narrower roads in mountainous areas. The entire cart weighs about 300 jin, and can carry 500 jin, which is equal to two to three times the load carried by livestock. The cost is also low, with each cart requiring only a little over 300 jin of millet.

　　解放区工业生产简讯
    （一）东北各军需生产单位自六月军区军需部成立实行统一集中领导后，军需生产有显著改进。各局在数十天中已完成棉衣总任务的百分之七十五；其中第二、三、四局且已超过任务。各局军鞋生产亦完成总任务的百分之七十七。质量上第一局已达到规定标准。第三局一厂合乎标准者亦提高到百分之九十九，一、三、四局两月来共节约布料四十八万六千四百方尺。
    （二）晋绥某公营工厂建立质量评等制度后，工人积极改进技术。钳工李文富等做了一套新工具，使某种零件的制造节省了两道手续，废活由百分之十二减至百分之二。过去铣一个牙轮需一个熟练工人做半小时，经工人朱鼎铭改制一套铣牙轮工具后，两个学徒六分钟即可完成。
    （三）华中公营大中纺织厂七月份实行新工资制度，按月计工者工资按技师、技工、半技工、轻工练习生分等交叉订定；按件计工者工资按质量分甲、乙、丙、丁数等订定。实行后，七月份毛巾间特、上等毛巾占总产量百分之八十八，而六月份为百分之八十四；布机间七月份特、上等布占总产量百分之九十七，六月份为占百分之九十二。产量一般亦超过原订计划。毛巾间未满三年年限的练习生，经按技术订定工资后，有五人被评为一等工人。
    （四）陕甘宁边区政府正以贷款、出售或租借等办法推广新制成功的小型大车。此种小型大车是参照华北平原的大车改造而成，其特点是在山地较狭的道路中也能通行。全车重量三百斤左右，载重五百斤，等于牲口驮运二倍至三倍。成本亦低，每辆只需三百余斤小米。
