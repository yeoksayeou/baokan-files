Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Vyshinsky refuted the speech of Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu at the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee on the 12th. The latter used the excuse of the civil war in China to oppose the Soviet Union's proposal for a one-third reduction in armaments by the five major powers. According to a TASS dispatch from Paris, Vyshinsky declared: "The Chinese representative frankly stated that the Soviet proposal is not suitable for them because a large part of Chinese territory is occupied by the Communist army, and the current Chinese government needs troops to suppress the Chinese people's liberation movement. The Chinese representative said that China's problem is not to reduce armaments but to increase them. But it does not take much effort to prove that the Chinese representative's opposition cannot stand. The United Nations cannot manage China's internal affairs. Only considerations of international politics are the concern of the United Nations. Of course, if the army is used as a police force, not to defend the country's borders, but to deal with its own people, it is difficult to expect this country to sympathize with the Soviet proposal to reduce armaments and troops by one-third."

　　国民党代表反对裁军维辛斯基予尖锐驳斥
    【新华社陕北二十日电】维辛斯基十二日在联大政治安全委员会上驳斥国民党代表蒋廷黻的演说，后者借口中国存在着内战来反对苏联关于五强裁军三分之一的建议。据塔斯社巴黎讯，维辛斯基宣称：“中国代表坦白声称苏联的建议不适合于他们，因为中国领土很大一部分为共产党军队所占领，中国现政府需要军队用以镇压中国人民的解放运动。中国代表说，中国的问题不是缩减军备而是增加军备。但这不用多费力就可证明：中国代表的反对意见绝不能成立。联合国不能管中国的内政。只有国际政治上的考虑，才是联合国的关心所在。当然，如果军队是被用来作警察兵力，不是用来保卫国家的疆界，而是被用去对付本国的人民，这种情况就很难希望这个国家会同情苏联所提裁减军备及兵力三分之一的建议。”
