　　Good News for Disabled Veterans

　　Remarkable Achievements of the Artificial Limb Factory

　　[Report from this newspaper] The artificial limb factory affiliated with the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Disabled Veterans Management Office has made considerable progress since its establishment in early 1946, under the technical guidance of technician Zhang Yuzhong. It has solved the mobility difficulties for a large number of disabled veterans. Over the past two years, all those introduced by the office to return home or reside in veterans' schools, as well as those introduced from neighboring organizations through certain procedures and meeting the criteria for limb fitting (those with thigh stumps shorter than six inches cannot be fitted), have been accommodated. A number of artificial arms have also been fitted (artificial arms are not yet widely fitted due to their limited functionality; fitting will be expanded after technical and material conditions improve). Additionally, some leg braces and arm braces have been made (for those whose legs or arms are not amputated but have fractured and deformed bones that cannot bear weight, fitting iron braces allows them to exert force, but those with injuries to the hip or shoulder cannot be fitted). Anyone fitted with a prosthetic lower leg can discard crutches and participate in general labor. Those with thigh amputations can walk without crutches, using only a small stick, after a few days of practice. They can walk on flat roads in their villages without a stick. Those with both lower legs amputated can only crawl or kneel before being fitted with artificial limbs; after being fitted, they can progress from using a crutch to a small stick, and some can even walk without a stick after a few days of practice. This is the general situation. The most significant results are: (1) Li Chengmao, the former cook squad leader of the office, a first-class disabled veteran, was missing a lower leg and had only half of his other foot. Initially, he crawled with great difficulty. After being fitted with a prosthetic lower leg, he was able to stand and walk, his spirits were high, and he requested work. He then became the cook squad leader at the Shijiazhuang warehouse. Except for not being able to go to the market, he worked as hard as a healthy person, capable of carrying a bucket of water to add to the pot, swinging a large axe to chop firewood, and often wrestling and playing games with others. He could climb slopes and hills with a small stick. (2) Zhai Chengrui, the squad leader of the directly subordinate team of the veterans' school, a first-class disabled veteran, was missing an entire upper arm and had an amputated lower leg. He originally hopped with a crutch, which was very strenuous. After being fitted with a prosthetic lower leg, he not only discarded the crutch but was also able to carry a load of water. (3) Liu Hongfa, a first-class disabled veteran from the veterans' school, was missing an upper arm, and one leg was completely unable to bear weight. He needed others to carry him for urination and defecation, and he was often pessimistic and distressed. After being fitted with a leg brace, he was able to walk on his own, and his spirits were also high. (4) Yu Zhen, a first-class disabled veteran from the veterans' school, had a thigh and a lower leg amputated. He was unable to crawl before being fitted with a prosthetic leg; now, after being fitted with a prosthetic lower leg, he is able to walk with crutches. (5) Sun En'yuan, a second-class disabled veteran, was fitted with an artificial back, which also played a role. This comrade had injured a nerve during an appendectomy several years ago, and his waist could not straighten up, making movement difficult; now, his waist can be straightened, and he is gradually able to walk. Now that the two major liberated areas of North China have merged, the factory is further reviewing its remaining shortcomings and plans to implement the following improvements in the future: (1) Strengthen leadership, enforce strict systems, improve work efficiency, and reduce costs. (2) Select lightweight raw materials, such as light iron sheets and paulownia wood (the willow root used by the JiZhong artificial limb factory is also much lighter), to improve the quality of artificial limbs. (3) Combine artificial limb production with ancillary production. For example, carpenters, ironworkers, and leatherworkers can use their expertise in their spare time to make and sell utensils, which can add more workers and prevent interruptions.

　　荣军福音
    假腿工厂成绩显著
    【本报讯】原晋察冀边区荣军管理处附设之假腿工厂，自一九四六年初成立以来，在技师张育忠技术指导下，工作已有相当成绩，为很大一批荣军解决了行动的困难。两年多来，凡经该处介绍回家或住荣校的，以及从友邻机关经一定手续介绍来，适合按腿条件的（大腿留的部分短于六寸者不能按），都予解决，并按了一部分假臂（假臂因作用不大，现在还不普遍按；待技术及物质条件改进后再按），还做过几个腿夹子，臂夹子（腿臂未截断而骨折变形不能用力者，按上铁夹子可以用力，但伤了胯骨与肩部的不能按）。凡按一支小腿者，都可去掉拐子，参加一般劳动。大腿截断者，按假腿后，经过几天练习，可以不用拐子，只拄一个小棍走路。在本村走平路可不用棍，截去两支小腿者，未按假腿前，只有跪行或爬行；按腿以后，经几天练习，由拄一拐到一个小棍，甚至有的不拄棍也可以走。这是一般的情况。最有显著效果者：（一）该处原炊事班长李成茂，一等残废，少一支小腿，另外一个脚只剩一半。初来时爬着走路，非常困难。按了一支小腿，能够站起走路，精神愉快，要求工作，于是又到石家庄仓库当了炊事班长，除不能赶集外，他与健壮人一样劳动，能提一桶水添锅，能抡大斧砍柴，并经常与人摔跤游戏，能拄一小棍上坡下岭。（二）荣校直属队班长翟成瑞，一等残废，上肢少一整臂，下肢截一小腿，原来拄一拐子跳着走路，费劲很大；按了一支小腿，不但去掉了拐子，而且能够挑一担水走路。（三）荣校一等荣军刘洪法，少一上肢，下肢一条腿也完全不能用力，大小便必须别人背，经常悲观苦恼；按了一个腿夹子，能够自己走路，精神也愉快了。（四）荣校一等荣军于珍，截去一支大腿，一支小腿。未按腿以前爬行也不可能；现在按了一个小腿，能够拄拐走路了。（五）二等荣军孙恩元按了一个假背，也起到一定作用。该同志是数年前割盲肠伤了神经，腰直不起来，行动困难；现在腰能挺直，逐渐能走路了。现在华北两大解放区合并，该厂更多方检讨尚存缺点，计划在今后实行如下改进：（一）加强领导、严格制度，提高工作效率，减低成本。（二）选找轻的原料，如轻铁板、梧桐木等（冀中假腿工厂使用柳木根也轻的多），提高假腿质量。（三）把做假腿与附带生产结合起来。如木工铁工皮工各就自己所长，在空闲时做些器物出售，这样可以多增添工人，不致间歇。
