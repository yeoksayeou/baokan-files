　　What Problems Exist in the Production Leadership of Jingxing?
　　Wang Hao, Bai Yufeng
　　[This newspaper reports] This reporter, after conducting on-the-spot interviews and discussions with responsible comrades at all levels in Jingxing, believes that Jingxing has organized all forces and conducted extensive policy propaganda among the masses during the autumn harvest and wheat planting. It is very necessary and has played a certain role in stabilizing the production emotions of the masses and allowing many villages to concentrate on production. However, it is undeniable that there are still many shortcomings in the county's leadership of mass production. This is mainly manifested in the following problems: First, the production leadership neglects the different conditions of the old areas (the first and sixth districts of the county are old areas), semi-old areas, and new areas, and generally deploys production. For example, the requirement for organizing is generally to "restore all old production organizations," but on the other hand, there is a lack of specific leadership methods for the problems existing in current mutual assistance. For example, some groups in Hujiatan, Sixth District, have problems in equal exchange, timely settlement of wages, and the use of livestock. Some people care about face and are embarrassed to mention losses. In Qishi Village, twelve mutual aid groups have irresponsible leaders, and members demand to re-elect the leaders. One of these villages is where the district is located, and the other is a key village for district leaders, but these problems have not been properly resolved. In addition, the general proposal to "restore the original production organizations" is also somewhat inappropriate, because many mutual aid groups and cooperatives were organized by coercion in the past, and the masses were originally dissatisfied. How can they be restored uniformly? There are no production organizations in the new areas, let alone the question of restoration. Comrade Han Shaobai, the county secretary, also said: "The production deployment is indeed general, and there is no distinction between the new and old areas." The deputy county magistrate said: "The mutual aid groups in the old areas have not improved for several years!" They are trying to find ways to overcome this shortcoming so that production does not stop at general appeals.
　　The second problem is that the county-level work decisions for September and October focus on production combined with correcting left-leaning deviations and resolving land reform legacy issues. However, deviations occurred in the execution. Some focused solely on correcting deviations, while some districts only focused on production and did not correct deviations. According to the Secretary of the Ninth District, the slogan was to focus on production, but the district and village cadres went down and only corrected deviations. In Zhangjiawa Village, all ninety households were readjusted to land, affecting seventy households (the district chief has gone to the village to deal with it). In Wangjia Village, a district cadre went to lead the correction of deviations, and in one morning, he had poor peasants return twelve donkeys. Some beat a cow to death because they were dissatisfied with returning livestock, and some village cadres ordered the masses to return things in order to please those who had been struggled against. More than half of the forty-six villages in the Ninth District were affected, some led by district cadres and some initiated by the villages themselves. As a result, the correction of deviations failed, and another deviation was created, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. A folk song circulating in the Ninth District said: "The landlord turns his hand, leads the livestock away, the landlord laughs, and the poor peasant claps his hands." This illustrates that this kind of unprincipled correction of deviations is seriously divorced from the masses. According to the secretaries of the Fifth and Sixth Districts, after the deployment of deviation correction, the masses were busy with the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and they did not do it because the masses did not accept it. Not a single land certificate has been issued in any village. When the reporter chatted with the masses in Hujiatan, Sixth District, and mentioned the issue of issuing land certificates, the masses' demands were very urgent. They said: "People will feel truly secure only after the land certificates are issued!" The county had arranged this work long ago and is only now printing them. The execution and inspection after the deployment are very inadequate.
　　The third is the issue of specific assistance and strengthened leadership for new cadres. County Secretary Comrade Han said: According to the understanding from the recent land reform party consolidation study meeting held in the county, among the sixty-five district cadres, the majority have left-leaning thoughts (believing that being a little left is better than being right), and 36% have beaten people. The policy education of cadres is still a major issue. Most of the cadres in the county are new cadres. For example, in the Sixth District, eleven of the seventeen cadres in the entire district were newly promoted; and the so-called "old cadres" have at most one or two years of work history. Therefore, the training and specific assistance of cadres are new issues that urgently need attention at present. The county has done a poor job in this regard. Comrade Liu Shuangju, the Secretary of the Sixth District, said about the county's leadership: "The county is very strict, but it only wants materials."
　　The fourth is the current state of organizational chaos, which should be vigorously overcome. The county's production organizations are unsound, and the cadres who promote the cooperatives have not yet been equipped. They have not played a promoting role in the mass autumn production, and the working method is to grasp everything at once. There is no systematic leadership, and the relationship between the party and the government is not clear. The county government issued an order to the district office to do a good job in seed selection, saying: The district party committee is responsible if it is not completed. The Secretary of the Sixth District personally handles marriage issues instead of the government. The village level is even more chaotic. Two labor heroes hold four positions (branch secretary, village head, executive committee member of the sub-district, county representative), and the county and district do not solve or cultivate them.
　　The reason for the above situation is mainly that the leadership does not pay enough attention to production. When the county magistrate and county secretary introduced the situation, they said: "At the beginning of this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting, we felt that there was no wasteland in the county, the land was very scarce (the county has an average of 1.8 mu per person), and there was no shortage of livestock (due to the development of the Jingxing mining industry, the masses raised more livestock for transportation). A lot of wheat was planted last year, especially in the past, there were large left-leaning deviations in the implementation of the land reform policy, which need to be vigorously reversed..." Comrade Hu Kaiming of the Prefectural Committee said: "When arranging the work of Jingxing, the Prefectural Committee also estimated that the past land reform work in Jingxing had relatively large left-leaning deviations, so the degree of emphasis was heavier. This will inevitably lead to an overemphasis on correcting deviations, which will affect production. However, it was also felt that deviations needed to be corrected urgently, so there was a lack of effective measures for production. Although the slogan was to focus on production, this invisibly reduced production." Of course, correcting left-leaning deviations in work is also for the purpose of developing production, but we should not neglect the farming season and affect the production of the masses because of correcting deviations. These are worthy of in-depth review by the leadership.

### 井陉生产领导存在些什么问题？

　　井陉生产领导存在些什么问题？
    汪浩·白玉峰
    【本报讯】记者在井陉经过实地访问及与各级负责同志研讨，认为井陉在秋收种麦中，组织了一切力量，并向群众进行了广泛的政策宣传，稳定下群众的生产情绪，使不少村群众安心生产，是很必要而且也起了它一定作用。但不可否认的，该县对群众生产领导上尚存有许多缺点，这主要表现在如下几个问题：首先是生产领导上忽视了老区（该县一、六区为老区）、半老区、新区的不同条件，而一般的布置生产。如对组织起来的要求笼统提出“恢复所有旧有的生产组织”，另一方面对当前互助中存在的问题，却缺少具体领导办法。如六区胡家滩有些组在等价交换、及时清理工资及牲口使用方面都有问题，有些群众是爱面子，吃了亏不好意思提等，七狮村十二个互助组，有些组长不负责任，组员要求改选组长；这两村一个是区的驻在地，一个是区领导的重点村，但这些问题都未得到应有解决。另外，笼统提出“恢复原有生产组织”，也有些不妥，因许多互助组和合作社过去是强迫命令组织起来的，群众本来就不满，怎能一律恢复呢？新区根本就没有生产组织，更谈不到什么恢复问题。县书韩少白同志也说：“生产布置确是一般化了，没有区别新老区的不同。”副县长说：“老区的互助组几年来就没提高！”他们正在想办法克服这个缺点，使生产不再停止在一般号召上。
    第二个问题是县级九、十月份的工作决定，以生产为主结合纠正左偏及解决土改遗留问题。但执行起来就发生了偏向，有的单纯纠偏，有的区光顾生产不纠偏。据九区区书谈：喊的是以生产为主，区村干部下去就光纠偏，张家洼全村九十户，又大调剂起土地来，动了七十户（区长已去该村处理）。王家村一个区干去领导纠偏，一个早晨就让贫农退了十二匹驴，有的因退牲口不满打死了一头牛，也有的村村干为了讨好被斗户，就命令群众退东西。九区共四十六个村，动的就有一半多，其中有的是区干领导的，有的是各村自己搞起的，这样一来，纠偏不成，反又造成一偏，群众大大不满。九区流传一首歌谣是：“地主翻转手，牵起牲口就是走，地主哈哈笑，贫农拍拍手。”说明这种不讲政策的纠偏，是严重的脱离了群众。又据五、六区区书谈，纠偏布置下去后，群众正忙于秋收种麦，群众不接受就没做。土地证也一村未发。记者在六区胡家滩和群众谈起心来，提起发土地证问题，群众要求非常迫切，他们说：“发下土地证人们心里才算真摸了底哩！”这一工作县里早有布置，现在才印制。布置后的执行检查是非常不够的。
    第三是对新干部的具体帮助和加强领导问题。县书韩同志谈：据最近在县召开的土改整党学习会上的了解，区干六十五人中，存有左倾思想的（认为左点比右强）占大半，打过人的占百分之三十六。干部的政策教育还是大事。该县大部是新干部，如六区全区十七个干部中，新提拔的就有十一人；而所谓“老干部”顶多也只有一二年的工作历史。因此对干部的培养和具体的帮助是当前极需注意的新问题。这一点，该县做得也差。六区区书刘双驹同志谈县的领导说：“县里抓的紧是紧，就是光要材料。”
    第四是目前组织上的混乱状态，应大力克服。该县生产组织不健全，至今推进社的干部还没配备起来，在群众秋季生产中未起他的推动作用，工作方式一把抓。没有系统的领导，党政的关系也分不清。县府向区公所下命令要做好选种工作说：完不成区分委负责。六区区书就亲自代替政府处理婚姻问题。村级更混乱，有两个劳动英雄身兼四职（支书、村长、小区执委、县代表），县区也不加解决和培养。
    形成以上情况的原因，主要是领导思想上对生产的重视不够。县长和县书介绍情况时谈：“今年秋收种麦之初，我们感到全县没有荒地，土地很少（全县每人平均一亩八分上下），牲畜不缺（因井陉矿业发展，群众多养牲口作运输），去年种麦不少，特别是过去执行土改政策中左倾偏向很大，需大力扭转……等。”地委胡开明同志谈：“布置井陉工作时，地委也估计到井陉过去土改工作左倾偏向较大，故在程度上放的是重一点。这样势必偏重于纠偏，就影响生产，但又感到偏急须纠，对生产也就缺乏做有效的措施，虽喊的以生产为主，这样就把生产无形中降低了一点”，当然纠正工作中的左偏，也是为了发展生产，但不应因为纠偏，而忽视农时，影响了群众的生产。这些是值得领导上深入检讨的。
