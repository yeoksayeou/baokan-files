In southern Shanxi, the democratic government has repaired a large canal, the Tongli Canal, which is eighty-two li long. The canal runs along the west bank of the Fen River, passing through twenty-five villages in the three counties of Zhaocheng, Hongdong, and Linfen, irrigating 67,300 mu of land. The canal was completed at the end of May this year, and water was released on June 1st. When the water flowed to Sunqu Village (25 li northwest of Linfen), at the end of the canal, the entire village, men, women, and children, gathered in groups, like celebrating a festival, and went to the canal banks to welcome the water, and slaughtered pigs to celebrate. It is estimated that this year, with the help of irrigation, these 25 villages can increase grain production by 234,000 shi, an increase of two and a half times compared to the original output.

The Tongli Canal has a sad history. It was dug in the late Song Dynasty and could irrigate about 6,000 mu of land in eighteen villages, but disputes never ceased. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Zhang Hefeng, a landlord in Haoyi Village at the head of the canal, exploited the backward thinking of the peasants and engaged in fights with outside villages, resulting in more than thirty peasant deaths and injuries. Under the rule of the landlords, the downstream villages could only contribute money, grain, and labor to repair the canal, but it was difficult for them to enjoy the benefits of the canal. When the Japanese invaders occupied the area, the burden on the peasants increased, and no one was in the mood to improve agriculture. The canal fell into disrepair and gradually became a dry ditch, and the 6,000 mu of paddy fields reverted to dry land.

Last year, Hongdong and Zhaocheng were liberated. In order to meet the peasants' demands for canal repair, the democratic government lent 1,000 shi of grain and established a water conservancy committee for the three counties of Linfen, Hongdong and Zhaocheng, which smoothly resolved the water disputes in Haoyi Village. As a result, the peasants upstream and downstream were overjoyed and started to repair the canal in October last year. At that time, the Yan Xishan-Hu Zongnan bandit troops in Linfen often harassed the area, and American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes repeatedly bombed and strafed the canal construction workers, resulting in more than ten deaths and injuries. However, this did not stop the canal construction project from proceeding. In the spring and summer of this year, a certain brigade of the People's Liberation Army besieging the city of Linfen participated in the canal construction project during breaks in fighting. All the officers and soldiers went to the river to carry stones and earth, contributing a total of 27,000 workdays, greatly saving civilian labor. On May 17th, Linfen was captured. Fourteen days later, the Tongli Canal was also completed. More than 60,000 mu of dry land became paddy fields, and the peasants along the canal will forever remember this day of "double happiness."

Statistics show that the entire project lasted seven months and used 212,086 workdays, saving 20,000 workdays compared to the original plan. The Tongli Canal was not only repaired, but also greatly expanded. The Water Conservancy Committee is now planning to further expand the canal, and is surveying the branch canal project to irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land.

### 汾西通利水渠的修复

　　汾西通利水渠的修复
    在山西南部，民主政府修复了一条全长八十二华里的大水渠，名通利渠。该渠紧靠汾河西岸，经过赵城、洪洞，临汾三县二十五个村庄，浇地六万七千三百亩。该渠于今年五月底完工，六月一日放水，当水流到了渠末的孙曲村（临汾西北二十五里），全村男女老少成群结队象过节日一样，走到渠垄迎水，并杀猪庆贺。据估计，今年因水利之助，此廿五村可增产粮二十三万四千石，较原来产量增二倍半。
    通利渠有一段伤心史：它开凿于宋代末年，共能浇十八个村约六千亩土地，从来纠纷不绝。民国十一年，渠头好义村地主张合丰利用农民的落后思想，与外村斗殴，死伤农民三十余人。在地主统治下，下游村庄只有出钱出粮出工修渠的份，却很难享受到水渠的利。日寇占据该地时，农民负担加重，谁也没有改良农业的心情，水渠失修，逐渐变成一条干沟，六千亩水田还原为旱地。
    去年洪、赵解放，民主政府为适应农民修渠要求，贷粮一千石，成立了临、洪、赵三县水利委员会，顺利解决了好义村的水利纠纷。于是上下游农民皆大喜悦，于去年十月起动工修渠。当时，临汾的阎胡匪军经常出扰，美制蒋机又屡次轰炸扫射修渠群众，先后死伤十余人，然而这并不能阻挡修渠工程的进行。今年春夏之交，围攻临汾城的解放军某旅乘战斗间隙参加了修渠工程，全体指战员都跑到河边去搬石头，担土块，帮工共达二万七千个，大大的节省了民力。五月十七日，临汾打下了，过了十四天，通利渠也完工了，六万多亩旱地变成水田，沿渠农民都永远记住了这个“双喜临门”的日子。
    统计全部工程历时七个月，用了二十一万二千零八十六个人工，较原定计划节约人工两万人。通利渠不仅修复，而且大大扩大了。水利委员会现正计划进一步扩大水渠，已在勘测浇地一万余亩之支渠工程。
