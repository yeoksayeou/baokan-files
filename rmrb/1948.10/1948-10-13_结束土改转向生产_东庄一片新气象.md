[North Yue News] After Dongzhuang Village, Qu County First District, completed land reform, eliminated feudalism, and quickly corrected deviations to focus on production, the village took on a new look.

At the beginning of the land reform, due to unclearly defined class status and some "leftist" deviations in policy implementation, such as not allowing middle peasants to attend meetings and increasing the burden of service for middle peasants, some middle peasants (especially well-to-do middle peasants) were once uneasy and dissatisfied with the poor peasant associations. However, this was quickly corrected. It was also publicized that land had been allocated and would not be changed again, and that the land and property rights of anyone would be protected by the government. The mood of the middle peasants gradually stabilized, and people from all walks of life actively engaged in great production.

This year, poor peasant Tian Luoxue has more than twenty mu of land, and has also been allocated floating wealth, purchasing three ropes, three willow baskets, a steel shovel, and a donkey. He said happily: "I have been completely liberated everywhere, and I dare to speak." In the past, he did not accumulate manure when slaughtering pigs. This year, more than twenty mu of land were all fertilized. Because the manure at home was not enough, he also bought two hundred catties of oil dregs and a load of manure. Before the autumn harvest was completed, he prepared to cultivate the land. He said: This year, he will respond to the call from higher authorities to "harvest one mu and cultivate one mu."

More than a dozen middle peasant households, including Tian Luosui, actively accumulated fertilizer, and each mu yielded two more dou than others. Middle peasant Tian Dong'er got up before dawn, made lunch in the morning, locked the door, and the whole family of three went to the field. This summer, he and his brother dug a well in six days and leveled the traditionally uncultivated ditch edges into land to plant buckwheat.

To support farmers' production, the government lent the village thirty-five dan of grain and 7.5 million yuan. After the farmers received floating wealth and loans, they purchased livestock and farm tools, raised pigs, and accumulated fertilizer in large quantities. According to a survey, the number of livestock in the village before the division was only a dozen, but now it has increased to sixty-six, of which poor peasants have newly added twenty-three, and middle peasants have newly added eight. Some middle peasants sold their donkeys during the division due to timidity, but now they have bought them back. The number of farm tools in the village has also increased significantly. In order to accumulate more fertilizer, more than two-thirds of the households are raising pigs. Last year, the village only raised forty-seven pigs, but this year it has increased to eighty.

Another major difference in production this year compared to previous years is that the land was universally hoed three times. Middle peasant Liu Xiaochen said: "I have never seen a large hoe being pulled as long as I can remember." This year's harvest is much better than last year, estimated to be 60-70% of a good year. Under the high enthusiasm for production, farmers spontaneously organized temporary mutual aid work. The four families of poor peasants Zhang Luogui, Zhang Qingshuan, Zhang Sanhuo, and Tian Shuanglin each divided more than one mu of paddy fields, all in one plot. All four families lacked labor, and it was both laborious and inefficient for one person to water the garden, so they discussed starting mutual aid work. The four of them took turns turning two water wheels, which was both easier and more efficient.

Well-to-do middle peasant Tian Zanger had a large cart and lacked manpower due to having a lot of land, so he and Tian Xiaozhi and Tian Quanfu, who did not have livestock, worked together, exchanging the cart and livestock for labor. They stipulated: whoever used the cart was responsible for the cattle feed, and whoever worked for whom provided the meals. Silly-zi's mother had three people but no one could go to the fields, while Zhang Luoyi had three people who could all go to the fields, but no women to do needlework. The two families then exchanged work, using farming for needlework. This kind of temporary, equal-value mutual aid is gradually developing.

Women have been allocated the same share of land, and their enthusiasm for production has also increased. Two-thirds of the young and middle-aged women in the village (twice as many as last year) participated in agricultural production, and were no less capable than men in watering gardens, hoeing fields, and harvesting grain. Young women Tian Shuangfen and Tian Lifen are the most useful in production. When their brothers were sick and others could not plant crops, the seedlings on the twenty-two mu of land were all hoed by the two sisters. After hoeing the fields, they didn't rest at noon, but took time to water the garden. All forty-six looms and one hundred and eighty-eight spinning wheels in the village were put into use. Thirty-eight women borrowed 100 catties of cotton, averaging ten turnovers in six months, earning a total of more than 5.7 million yuan. Zhang Yanqi's mother borrowed two catties of cotton and turned it over seven times. In addition to earning enough to buy oil, salt, and food, she also earned two bolts of large cloth and one bolt of small cloth. She said happily, "We will repay when the higher-ups want us to."

Under the influence of the farmers and the education of the cadres, several landlords also began to participate in labor. Tian Shengfu made the fastest progress in labor, carrying six buckets of grain alone during the autumn harvest. He also learned a lot of other production techniques.

When the autumn harvest arrived, all the men, women, and children in the village participated in harvesting and threshing grain. In less than ten days, the grain was all harvested. During threshing, the poor peasant women looked at the golden grain and said: In the past, the landlords always said that they had strong lives, but this year our poor people also have strong lives, and our grain is also piled up in mounds. Some said: "We never had so much grain before, let's work hard! See you at the New Year."

　　结束土改转向生产
    东庄一片新气象
    【北岳讯】曲阳一区东庄村完成土改，消灭了封建迅速纠正偏向转上生产后，村中面貌一新。
    土改开始，由于阶级未划清，执行政策的某些左倾偏向，如不让中农开会，加重中农勤务负担等原因，使一部中农（特别是富裕中农）情绪一度不安，对贫农团不满，但很快即纠正了。又宣传了土地已经分定，不再变动。任何人的土地、财产权均受政府保护。中农情绪逐渐转趋稳定，各阶层人民积极投入大生产。贫农田洛雪今年有了二十多亩地，又分了浮财，置买了三条绳三个柳罐、一个钢锹还有一头驴，欢喜的说：“我这可到处都翻了身啦，也敢说话啦”。过去杀猪也不积粪，今年二十多亩地全上了粪。家里的粪不够上，又买了二百斤油渣和一部大粪，秋收未完就准备耕地，他说：今年要响应上级号召“割一亩耕一亩”。田洛随等十几户中农积极积肥，每亩地总比别人多打二斗，中农田栋儿天不明就起床，早晨作出中午的饭来，把门一锁，一家三口人全下了地。今夏他哥俩六天挖了一个土井，并把历来不种的地边水沟平成地种上荞麦。
    为扶助农民生产，政府贷给该村粮食三十五石，款七十五万元，农民得了浮财，又贷了粮款，便大量的购买牲口、农具养猪积肥。据调查，全村牲口在平分前只剩下十几头，现在已增至六十六头，内贫农新增了二十三头，中农新增了八头。有些中农平分时因胆小把驴卖了，现在又买回来。全村农具也增加不少。为了多积肥，三分之二以上的农户都养着猪。去年全村只养猪四十七口，今年增加到八十口。今年生产与往年还有一大不同，即是普遍锄了三遍，中农刘小辰说：“从我记事没见拉过大锄”。今年收成比去年强的多，占计有六、七成年景。在生产情绪高涨下，农民自觉的组织了临时性帮忙式的拨工。贫农张洛圭、张青拴、张三货、田双林四家，各分了一亩多水地，都在一个地块上，四家全缺劳力，一人浇园又费力，也浇不多，便商量着拨起工来。四人两把辘轳换着拧，又省劲、又多浇。富裕中农田藏尔有大车，地多缺人力，便和没牲口的田小致、田全福拨工，以大车牲口换人工，他们规定：谁使大车谁管牛草料，人给谁家作活，谁家管饭。傻子他娘三口人没人下地，张洛义三口人全能下地，就没女人做针线，两家便相互拨工，以庄稼活换针线活。这种临时性的等价拨工，正逐步发展着。
    妇女分得同样一份土地，生产积极性也提高了。全村三分之二的青壮妇女（比去年增加一倍）参加了农业生产，浇园、耪地、割谷都不次于男人。青妇田双芬、田丽芬生产最中用，兄弟有病别人种不了庄稼，二十二亩地的苗子全是她姐儿俩耪的。耪地回来不歇晌，抽空还浇园。全村四十六架织布机和一八八辆纺车全部动了起来。三十八名妇女贷棉一百斤，六个月平均转了十个过，共赚五百七十多万元。张彦奇他娘借了二斤棉花转了七过，除挣着买油打盐吃以来，还赚了两匹大布、一匹小布，她高兴的说：“上边多会要咱多会还”。在农民的影响和干部的教育下，几户地主也开始参加劳动。田生福劳动进步最快，秋收时一人担六个谷。其他生产技术也学会不少。
    秋收到了，全村五女老少均参加了割谷打场，不到十几天就把谷割完了。打场时，贫农妇女们看着金黄的谷子说：过去财主们净说他们命强，今年咱们穷人命也强啦，咱们的谷也是一垛一垛的。有的说：“以往咱可没这么多谷，吃劲干吧！过年见”。
