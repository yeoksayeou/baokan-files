Xinhua News Agency, North China, 25th. A violent incident occurred in Nanjing where American soldiers savagely beat Chinese elementary school students. According to reports from the Tianjin Yishibao and other Nanjing sources: On October 10th, Nanjing Xinsheng Elementary School's Boy Scouts were blowing bugles at the school gate to assemble for an outing when, coinciding with a Mass being held in the Hongguang Middle School chapel on the east side of the school, a foreigner ran out and snatched the elementary school student's bugle, twisting his arm. As the student cried out, several American soldiers ran out of the chapel, seized the Boy Scout's baton, and began beating him. The students were all eleven or twelve years old. Wang Baoshun and five others suffered injuries to the back of their heads, arms, and buttocks. When the elementary school principal, Xu Zheren, tried to stop them, he was also beaten in the eyes and wrist. After the assault, the American soldiers were taken away in a car by American military police. Afterwards, on the 12th, the US Embassy's press office released a statement from the US Military Advisory Group, shamelessly denying the American soldiers' violent act.
