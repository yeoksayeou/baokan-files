　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region
  　Launching a Mass Economic Struggle Against the Enemy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th] The Guanzhong and Huanglong sub-regions of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, which are adjacent to enemy-controlled areas, have launched a mass economic struggle against the enemy, expelling enemy currency from the region. The Guanzhong Sub-Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided at a meeting at the end of August to widely publicize the significance of the economic struggle against the enemy among cadres and the masses, using marketplaces, blackboards, and newspapers, and to expose Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy and deception of "currency system reform," strictly prohibiting the circulation of enemy currency and silver dollars in the market, as well as illegal currency transactions. Smuggling prevention work was strengthened in the border areas. Each county organized a special committee, whose main task was to organize the masses to expel enemy currency. The ＠Yi County established a committee to expel enemy currency and launched extensive publicity. Enemy currency has now been largely eliminated in the urban areas of the county, Qingyuan, Taiyu and other regions. After listening to the explanations, farmers in various places took the enemy currency they had stored to the border to try to spend it. Militias and guerrillas in Zhanghong District conducted inspections at various stations to strictly prohibit enemy currency from entering the border area. The Huanglong Sub-Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party took the initiative to lead the masses in the economic struggle against the enemy, issuing an emergency notice on September 7, calling on cadres at all levels to study the articles and news about Chiang Kai-shek's "currency system reform" published in the Masses Daily, as well as the border region government's proclamation on eliminating enemy currency and maintaining our currency. Government, financial, and trade organizations at all levels in urban areas held symposiums with merchants and citizens to discuss the expulsion and elimination of enemy currency, as well as strictly prohibiting enemy currency or counterfeit "gold yuan coupons" from invading the border region, and strictly preventing the outflow of gold, silver, and silver dollars from the border region. Since the liberation of this sub-region this spring, thanks to our army's continuous military victories and the trade company's large-scale exchange of agricultural currency, the organization of material exchanges between new and old areas, the regulation of prices, and the rectification of ports, the credit of agricultural currency has been increasing day by day. Enemy currency had been eradicated from the markets in the central areas of Huanglong, Yichuan, Luochuan, and Hancheng as early as July. When the counterfeit "gold yuan coupon" flowed to the border guerrilla areas, the enemy currency depreciated rapidly, and the credit of agricultural currency increased unprecedentedly. One month after the liberation of Chengcheng, the purchasing power of agricultural currency increased day by day, and the prices of six major necessities of life fell by an average of 41.2 percent. When the counterfeit "gold yuan coupon" flowed into the city, merchants and citizens refused to use it, and when the masses mentioned "legal currency" or "gold yuan coupon," they all said: "These bills stink! They're not worth a penny!" The masses in the border areas automatically carried out barter trade and refused to use enemy currency. Agricultural currency has become widespread in large and small villages in the guerrilla areas. Even in some enemy-occupied areas, the masses secretly use agricultural currency.
