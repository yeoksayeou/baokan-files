[Jinnan Dispatch] With the autumn harvest completed, the entire Jinnan region is currently launching a crash wheat planting campaign. Cadre meetings in various counties and districts of the First Special District, as well as village cadre meetings convened in each district, have all proposed sowing, plowing, and planting immediately after the harvest, while earnestly resolving difficulties related to labor, livestock power, and fertilizer. Yuanzhao strives to plant 70% of the land with wheat. After the planting began, aside from practical difficulties, the main issue was addressing the masses' ideological concerns. After five days of promoting "Whoever sows, reaps" and "Sow more, reap more, without increasing the burden," the First District played a significant role in dispelling the masses' ideological anxieties. Before the propaganda, An Enquan, a middle peasant from Denglou Village, feared equal distribution and gave away four mu of land to others. After the meeting, he wanted it back, bought 30,000 yuan worth of manure, applied it to the land, and planted wheat with peace of mind. In advance, Qiu County promoted the cooperative to buy red grain, bulrush seeds, and cotton oil for distribution to each village to mix with wheat seeds, preventing insect pests. Xin County requires 70% of the land to be planted with wheat. During the wheat planting in the Second District, cattle-raising households in various villages felt that they didn't have much early stubble and were afraid that others would borrow their animals after they finished their work and injure them, so they delayed plowing. Households without cattle waited for village cadres to assign them cattle for assistance, so they were not in a hurry. After the Second District government discovered this, they first mobilized households without cattle not to wait, explaining that "they can exchange labor at an equal value with others, and they are not allowed to use other people's livestock for free." After this propaganda, Sun Village and Wu Village began planting wheat with peace of mind, and have now planted 5.2 hectares of early stubble. In Xifuzhuang, Sixth District of Guantao, village cadres discussed how to solve the masses' difficulties in planting wheat on the evening of the 17th, and decided to mobilize people to pull stone rollers and livestock to pull drills, thereby exchanging labor and livestock power to solve the shortage of livestock. After the meeting, led by village chief Li Yun, they finished planting 47 hectares of early stubble in two days and are now rushing to plant late stubble. The masses in the Second Special District know that the scope of extraction and replenishment is small, and that whoever plants will reap, so they are highly motivated to plant wheat. Some villages in Gaotang and Pingyuan, fearing the land drying out, are rushing to plant early, and the flood-stricken areas in the west are planting as soon as they can cultivate a piece of land. On September 5th, the Third Special Administrative Office arranged a seven-day wheat planting blitz week, calling on cadres to put down all unnecessary work and help the masses solve various difficulties in wheat planting, but absolutely prohibiting the forced assignment of middle peasant livestock to widows and widowers to plant wheat, or other compulsory acts, to complete the task. In addition, cadres are urged to pay close attention to the occurrence of insect pests. In Kuzhubao, Qiyi, 140 mu of wheat were planted in two days, all after the late seedlings were harvested and then hoed again, so that both wheat planting and autumn harvest were not delayed. It is estimated that each county in the Third Special District has planted more than 20% of the wheat, and some districts in Weixian have planted 50%.

　　宣传谁种谁收
  　冀南全区突击种麦
    【冀南电】秋收已过，目前冀南全区正突击种麦。一专区各县区干部会议及各区召开的村干会上，都提出随收、随耕、随播种，并切实解决劳畜力及肥料困难。元朝争取种麦百分之七十。种麦开始后，除有实际困难外，主要是解决群众思想问题。一区经过五天宣传“谁种谁收”“多种多收不多负担”，对解除群众思想顾虑上起到极大作用。从等耧村中农安恩泉在宣传前怕要平分，送给别人四亩地，开会后他又要回来，买了三万元的粪上到地里，安心种上麦。邱县事前推动合作社买妥红粮、芒菜籽、棉油分贷各村掺麦种，以防虫害。莘县种麦要求达到百分之七十；二区种麦中，各村喂牛户觉着自己早茬不多，活干完了怕别人借用，牲口被伤，便拖延不开耧；没牛户等待村干给派牛助耕，因此也不慌不忙；二区政府发觉后，首先动员没牛户不要等待，说明“能与别人等价换工，不许白使用人家的牲口”。孙庄、武庄经此宣传后，双方开始安心进行种麦，现已种上茬五顷二十亩。馆陶六区西付庄，十七号晚村干研究如何解决群众种麦困难，决定动员人拉砘子、牲口拉耩，以此进行人畜力换工，解决缺牲口困难；会后在村长李云魁带领下，两天种完早茬七百二十五亩，现正抢种晚茬。二专区群众知道抽补范围很小，谁种谁收，种麦劲头很高。高唐、平原有些村怕干了地正赶早抢种，西部水灾区涸出一块种一块。九月五号三专署布置七天种麦突击周，号召干部放下一切不必要的工作，帮助群众解决种麦中各种困难，但绝对禁止为完成任务硬派中农牲口给孤寡种麦，或其他强迫行为。另外号召干部切实注意虫灾发生。企之苦水堡，两天种麦一百四十亩，都是等晚苗收割后再锄一遍，这样种麦秋收两不误。估计三专区各县已耩麦百分之二十以上，魏县有的区已种了百分之五十。
