Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS, Berlin, 3rd reports: Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, in a conversation with German newspaper reporters regarding the situation in Berlin, stated that Western countries do not genuinely want to resolve the issue. Their purpose in complicating the Berlin problem is to divert public attention from their division of Germany and the establishment of a West German state, and to conceal the aggressive Western military bloc formed for anti-Soviet and anti-people's democracy purposes, diverting worldwide attention from peace and disarmament issues.

　　After narrating the origins of the Berlin problem and the various activities of the United States, Britain, and France in undermining the economies of Berlin and the Soviet-occupied zone, Sokolovsky solemnly declared that the so-called "blockade of Berlin," maliciously propagated by Western countries, does not actually exist. All residents of Berlin have every opportunity to obtain supplies of grain and other necessities from the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin. The so-called "airlift" by Western countries is purely propaganda because, even today, Berlin is primarily supplied by the Soviet-occupied zone. According to very incomplete statistics, the Soviet Union supplies Berlin's western sector with as much as 900 tons of supplies daily, not including coal. As early as the beginning of July, the Soviet Union had already decided to assume the responsibility of supplying the needs of the entire Berlin population. The Soviet Union immediately delivered 100,000 tons of grain and later delivered 10,800 tons of fats. It was only due to the obstruction of the Berlin City Council, acting on the will of the United States, Britain, and France, that residents of West Berlin could not directly purchase these supplies from stores in West Berlin. As for the supply of coal, electricity, and gas to West Berlin, this entirely depends on whether the Western authorities are willing to remove their obstacles to commercial exchanges between West Berlin and the Soviet-occupied zone because the Soviet-occupied zone is capable of supplying these raw materials and fuels.

　　Sokolovsky then described in detail the course of the Berlin negotiations and the points of divergence, stating that the Berlin negotiations began on August 31. On the issue of lifting traffic restrictions between Berlin and the Western-occupied zones, the Soviet military governor had endeavored to seek a satisfactory basis for restoring normal traffic in accordance with the instructions of the Four Power governments. Accordingly, the Soviet Union proposed on September 7 specific measures for the routes of passenger and freight traffic between Berlin and the Western zones and the number of trains to be run daily. It also suggested that the four occupying powers issue orders prohibiting the transportation of currency, Western Marks, or Eastern Marks by train, automobile, or airplane; that air traffic supplying the Western occupying forces in Berlin be handled in accordance with the Control Council decision of November 30, 1945; and that all railways and waterways between the Western and Eastern sectors be open for international commerce and international traffic. Military transport should present freight manifests; grain transport should be inspected according to the manifest, and commercial transport should be inspected according to the license. Joint control agencies of both sides should be established at the entry and exit stations to inspect military trains and transport vehicles—both in the area bordering the occupation zones and in the Berlin area. However, the Western occupying authorities were clearly unwilling to adopt this proposal. They could not offer clear opinions but only tried to remove the discussion of the air traffic issue, as if it were entirely within their jurisdiction, and used the air traffic issue as an excuse to refuse to discuss the other proposals mentioned above. Sokolovsky explained that the decision passed by the Control Council on November 30, 1945, stated that air traffic between Berlin and West Germany was for the convenience of supplying the Western occupying forces in Berlin. The Soviet proposal did not amend this decision. The fact is that since there are two currencies, the establishment of Soviet command management over all cargo transportation, including air transportation, is a necessary measure to protect the currency of the Soviet-occupied zone and prevent illegal and prohibited transportation.

　　Sokolovsky pointed out that the directives of the Four Power governments stipulated that the Soviet-occupied zone Mark should be adopted as the sole currency in Berlin and that the circulation of "B" Mark in Berlin should be stopped. The regulations for the single currency circulation in Berlin should be implemented by the German issuing bank in the Soviet-occupied zone through the existing credit institutions in Berlin, and a financial committee composed of representatives of the four governors should be established to supervise the measures for the single currency circulation in Berlin. However, the position of the Western governors clearly sought to obtain a position in Berlin that would, in effect, completely control the financial policies and currency reforms of Berlin and the Soviet-occupied zone. They proposed that the Western authorities implement their own financial policies through the Berlin City Bank, and that the business of the German issuing bank in the Soviet-occupied zone should also be subject to the control of the financial committee, which in effect meant that the currency circulation in the Soviet-occupied zone would also be subject to the control of the Four Power financial committee. This is completely unfounded, especially because the currency circulation in the West German-occupied zones is completely subject to the military authorities in those zones.

　　When discussing trade issues, Sokolovsky stated that the Soviet government, in its note of September 25, suggested that trade between Berlin (on the one hand) and the Western-occupied zones and third countries (on the other hand) should be carried out with import and export licenses issued on a four-power basis. General Clay, the U.S. military governor, proposed precisely this rule in the Berlin negotiations. However, the Western countries are trying to stipulate a method that would result in the Soviet military government completely losing its possibility of participating in the management of trade between Berlin and the Western-occupied zones and third countries. If this attempt were to be realized, it would mean opening the door wide for various speculators in West Berlin, causing irreparable damage to the economy of the Soviet-occupied zone and to the currency circulation of Berlin and the Soviet-occupied zone.

　　Sokolovsky finally pointed out that the course of the negotiations proves that the Soviet Union is willing to continue the negotiations based on the Moscow agreement of August 30. Whether an agreement on the Berlin issue can be reached on a practical basis depends entirely on the wishes of the United States, Britain, and France. Attempts to solve the Berlin problem by other means are obviously aimed only at prolonging the abnormal situation in Berlin, and the Western occupying powers should be held responsible for this.

　　索柯洛夫斯基谈话：西方国家把柏林问题复杂化的目的在转移公众对他们分裂德国的注意
    【新华社陕北九日电】据塔斯社柏林三日电，德境苏军军政府总督索柯洛夫斯基元帅就柏林形势对德报记者发表谈话称：西方国家并不想真正解决问题，他们将柏林问题复杂化的目的，是在转移公众对他们分裂德国和建立西德国家的注意力，并掩盖他们成立反苏反人民民主国家的侵略性的西方军事集团，转移全世界对和平和对裁军问题的注意。
    在叙述柏林问题起因及美英法破坏柏林及苏占区经济的种种活动之后，索柯洛夫斯基郑重声明：西方国家恶意叫嚣的所谓“柏林封锁”实际上并不存在。柏林全体居民有一切机会自柏林苏占区获得粮食等类必需品的供应，西方国家的所谓“空运”纯粹是一种宣传，因为即使在今天，柏林实际上主要仍靠苏占区供给。据很不完全的统计，苏联每日供给柏林西区的物资数达九百吨之多，煤还不算在内。早在七月初，苏联就已决定担负供给整个柏林居民需要的责任。苏联当即交付了十万吨谷物，以后又交村了一万零八百吨脂肪。只是由于柏林市议会秉承美英法意志，从中阻挠，才使柏林西区居民不能直接从西区店铺中购得这些供应品。至于对柏林西区的煤、电和煤气的供给，这完全要看西方当局是否愿取消其对于柏林西区与苏方占区工商业来往的障碍而定，因为苏方占区本能供给这些原料和燃料的。
    索柯洛夫斯基随即详细叙述这次柏林谈判经过及分歧点，略称：柏林谈判于八月三十一日开始，在取消柏林与西德占区交通限制问题上，苏军总督曾竭力按照四国政府指示，寻求恢复正常交通的满意的基础。据此，苏联曾于九月七日建议中提出柏林与西占区间客货交通经由路线及每日行驶列车数目等具体办法；并建议由四占领军当局发布命令，禁止以火车、汽车，或飞机运送货币、西方马克或东方马克；供给柏林西方占领军之需要的空中交通按照一九四五年十一月三十日管制委员会决定办理。西区与东区间一切铁路与水路均供国际商务及国际交通之用。军事运输应呈验运货清单；粮食运输按清单检查，商运按执照检查；在进出站口设立双方共同的管制机构，检查军用火车及运输汽车——占领区间交界地区及柏林地区同。但各西方占领当局显然不愿采纳这一建议。他们不能提出明确的意见，只是力图取消空中交通问题的讨论，好象这完全是他们权限以内的事情，并以空中交通问题为借口，拒绝讨论上述其他各项建议。索氏说明，管委会在一九四五年十一月三十日通过之决定，载明柏林与西德间的空中交通系便利供给柏林西方占领军之用。苏方建议并未修改这个决定。事实是既然有两种货币的存在，自须建立苏方司令部对一切货运包括空运在内的管理，这种管理是保护苏占区货币，防止非法及违禁运输所必不可少的办法。
    索氏指出，四国政府的指令，规定采取苏占区马克为柏林唯一的货币并停止“Ｂ”记马克在柏林的流通；规定柏林单一货币流通条例，由苏占区德国发行银行经过柏林现有信用机关实施之，并设立一由四国总督代表组成的金融委员会监督柏林单一货币流通的各项措施。但是，西方总督的立场，显然想在柏林取得实际上属于完全控制柏林和苏占区金融政策和货币改革的地位。他们提议由西方当局通过柏林市银行实行他们自己的金融政策，并且德国发行银行在苏占区的业务也要受金融委员会的管制，实际上就是说苏占区的货币流通也要受四国金融委员会的管制。这是完全没有根据的，特别是因为西德占区内货币流通是完全受制于各该区军事当局的。
    索氏谈及贸易问题时称：苏联政府在其九月二十五日照会中建议柏林（一方）与西部各占区及第三国（另一方）之间的贸易应在四国的基础上颁发进出口执照实行之。美军总督克莱在柏林谈判中所提议的正是这一规则。然而，西方国家却力图规定一种办法，其结果会使苏联军政府全部丧失其参与管理柏林与西部各占区及第三国间通商的可能性。这一图谋如告实现，则将意味着为柏林西区的各种投机商大开其门，而使苏占区经济、使柏林及苏占区与柏林的货币流通招致无可补偿的损害。
    索氏最后指出：谈判的过程证明苏联是愿意根据莫斯科八月三十日协议继续谈判的。柏林问题能否在切实基础上达成协议全要看美、英、法愿望如何。欲以其他方法解决柏林问题的企图，其目的显然只在于延长柏林之反常情势，西方占领国对此应负其责。
