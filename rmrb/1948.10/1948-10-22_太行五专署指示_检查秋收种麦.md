Taihang Fifth Prefecture Commissioner's Office Issues Instructions
Inspect Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting
    [Taihang News] In order to concretely promote production, the Taihang Fifth Prefecture Commissioner's Office has instructed all counties and districts to inspect the autumn harvest and wheat planting. The inspection content points out: (1) Check the plowing, harrowing, and application of manure. How much manure has not been applied, and what is the wheat planting area, accounting for what percentage of the total land? What is the situation of labor and animal power organization in the autumn harvest and wheat planting? In areas where animal power is lacking, is there any adjustment? All localities (especially at the district level) should have a planned and organized effort to organize the masses to sell daytime labor and adjust animal power, but prices cannot be restricted or stipulated, and the principle of voluntary mutual benefit of the masses must be strictly observed. (2) What difficulties are there with wheat seeds in disaster-stricken areas? Has any adjustment been made? Efforts should be made to mobilize the masses to organize mutual assistance and mutual relief, promote the past social mutual relief habits of the masses, or make appropriate adjustments. This kind of adjustment should be specifically planned by the district and approved by the county government, and the past blind and unplanned and purely relief-oriented views must be overcome. (3) During wheat planting, can all fallow land be completely eliminated? (4) Check the implementation of autumn seed selection. (5) What is the current insect pest situation in various places? Attention should be paid to this. (6) During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, what is the situation of cultivation on behalf of military dependents and martyrs' families?
    In addition to the above points, each county should make a detailed inspection plan based on the specific situation, conduct the inspection conscientiously, promote it universally, and report and report to the Commissioner's Office at any time.

　　太行五专署指示
  　检查秋收种麦
    【太行讯】太行五专署为具体推动生产，特指示各县区检查秋收种麦。在检查内容上指出：（一）检查犁、耙、上粪情形，还有多少没上粪，种麦面积多大，占总土地百分之几。秋收种麦中劳畜力的组织情况如何，畜力缺乏的地区，是否进行调剂？各地（特别是区级）应有计划有组织的组织群众卖晌，调剂畜力，但不能限制或规定价格，严守群众自愿两利原则。（二）遭灾地区麦种有何困难？进行了调剂没有？应尽量动员群众组织互助互济，发扬群众以往的社会互济习惯，或适当调剂。此种调剂要由区具体计划县府批准，一定要克服以往的盲目无计划以及单纯救济观点。（三）在种麦中，是否能将所有熟荒消灭尽净？（四）检查秋季选种执行程度如何？（五）目前各地虫荒情况如何！应严加重视。（六）秋收种麦中对军烈干属的代耕情况如何？
    除以上数点外，各县应根据具体情况做出详细检查计划切实进行检查，普遍推动，并要随时向专署反映和报告。
