Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th: The Kuomintang government's "Measures for Clearing Legal Tender Bonds" is another deceptive and predatory "economic measure" after its "currency reform." This act of plunder by the Kuomintang government has aroused great anger among bondholders. According to Shanghai press reports: More than two hundred bondholders in Shanghai sent four representatives to Nanjing on September 17 to petition. Representative Song Xieming made a statement before the trip, denouncing the Kuomintang government's "Measures for Clearing Legal Tender Bonds" as equivalent to defaulting on debt, "Not only do bondholders not expect to receive any benefits, but even their original investment will be completely lost." According to these measures, the principal and interest of various bonds that had already been drawn and matured before the "currency reform" on August 19 of this year would be repaid at a rate of one legal tender yuan for one yuan, and then converted into pseudo-gold yuan for distribution. Thus, a person who purchased bonds worth 30,000 silver yuan before the "legal tender issuance" can now only receive one fen of gold yuan. Even for bonds that are "redeemed in advance" before maturity, the measures generally stipulate repayment of principal at 27,000 times the legal tender value, which is then converted into gold yuan at 3 million times the legal tender value. "One ten thousand silver yuan" before the "legal tender" issuance "could buy eight large gold bars, or eight hundred 'shi' of rice," but now "it can only get ninety gold yuan, which can only buy four qian and five fen of gold, or four 'shi' of rice."

　　国民党又一新骗术
  　“清偿法币公债”事实上等于赖债
    【新华社华东二十日电】国民党政府的“清偿法币公债办法”，是其“币改”后又一欺骗性和掠夺性的“经济措施”。国民党政府的这一劫掠行为已引起持券人的极大愤怒。据沪报讯：上海市公债持券人二百余人，推派代表四人于九月十七日赴南京请愿，代表宋谢铭于行前发表谈话，指斥国民党政府“清偿法币公债办法”等于赖债，“不仅持券人休想拿到利益，就是连老本也都蚀得干干净净。”按照该项办法，在今年八月十九日“币改”以前已经中签及到期的各种公债的本息，一律以法币一元还一元，再折合伪金圆券发给，那么“法币发行”前购买了三万元银元的公债，现在只可以拿到金圆券一分钱。即以未到期“提前清偿”的公债而论，该办法一般规定按法币二万七千倍还本，再以三百万倍折合金圆券，“法币”发行前一万元银元“可买金子八大条，买白米八百石”，现在“只可得金圆券九十元，只可买金子四钱五分，白米四石”。
