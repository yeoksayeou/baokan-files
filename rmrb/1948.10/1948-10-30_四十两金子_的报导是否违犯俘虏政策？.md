　　Does the report "Forty Taels of Gold" violate the policy on prisoners of war?
　　Comrades Editors: After reading "Forty Taels of Gold" published on page 2 of the 38th issue of the People's Daily, we have the following feelings:
　　The policy on prisoners of war is one of the Party's policies and should be observed. For example, some personal belongings of prisoners of war, such as watches, pens, Chiang currency, clothing, and some small items, should all belong to them personally. However, a huge amount of gold and silver like this does not seem to belong to the individual. The reason is that these things were plundered from the common people, and even harmed the lives of many people. Although he has laid down his weapons today and is not an enemy, before he laid down his weapons, he was generally a bully who oppressed the masses, so we should not deal with the property he plundered from the masses in this way. At the same time, if this large sum of money is used for social construction in the future, it will bring more benefits and happiness to the people. The above is my personal opinion, and it may be that our understanding of the policy on prisoners of war is not enough. I don’t know if it is correct or not. I hope you can answer it. (Zhang Tingwu)
　　Answer: Your opinion on Comrade Yang Shuo’s report on "Forty Taels of Gold" has some basis, but from the perspective of the Party's policy, this reason is biased.
　　Our policy on prisoners of war is based on disintegrating the enemy, expanding the political influence of our army, and striving for victory in the war. It is good to be able to win over the enemy on the battlefield to lay down their weapons as early as possible, even a day, an hour, or even a minute earlier. Not confiscating the personal property of prisoners of war is to reduce their concerns and enable them to surrender earlier in certain situations. Forty taels of gold is a considerable amount, and it is entirely possible that it was plundered from the common people. Confiscating it and using it for social construction would benefit the masses. However, because his gold was not confiscated, the enemy battalion commander, who regarded money as his life, was "greatly moved and realized a truth: although gold is valuable, in the liberated areas, there is something more noble than gold, and that is the solemn revolutionary discipline." The appeal of our great revolutionary spirit made him grateful and grateful. After he was released, he publicized it wherever he went, and publicized it to every person he met, so that dozens or hundreds of enemy officers and soldiers would know this fact, which would be enough to reduce their fighting will. In this way, comparatively speaking, the effect we receive is much greater than forty taels of gold.
　　To defeat the counter-revolution, we must focus on the larger and more distant interests. This is politics. The policy on prisoners of war does not search the pockets of prisoners of war, and there is no regulation on how much should be confiscated. This is the reason.
　　Therefore, we believe that if this gold is indeed not public funds, it is right to return it to the prisoner of war. Comrade Yang Shuo’s report publicized the Party’s policy and there is nothing wrong with it.

### “四十两金子”的报导是否违犯俘虏政策？

　　“四十两金子”的报导是否违犯俘虏政策？
    编辑同志：人民日报第三十八号第二版刊登之“四十两金子”，我们阅后有如下感觉：
    俘虏政策，是党的政策的一项，应遵守，如俘虏的一些个人物品，表、笔、蒋币、衣服以及一些小物品，应全部属于其个人。但象这样巨量金银，似乎不该属其个人。原因是：他这些东西，是从老百姓身上搜刮的，甚至是害了老百姓好多生命。虽今天他放下武器，不是敌人，但未放武器之前，一般则是蛮横的欺压群众者，故不应对其搜刮群众的财物如此处理。同时这笔巨款将来用到社会建设方面，是会使人民多一分利益和幸福的。以上这是我个人意见，也可能是我们对俘虏政策了解不够，不知正确与否，请解答是盼。　　　　　（张廷武）
    答：你对杨朔同志写的“四十两金子”的报导的意见有其部分理由，但从党的政策观点来看，这个理由是有偏见的。
    我们的俘虏政策，是从瓦解敌人，扩大我军的政治影响，争取战争胜利出发的。能争取战场上敌人提早放下武器，哪怕提早一日甚至一点钟一分钟，也是好的。对俘虏私人财物不加没收，是为了减少他们的顾虑，使其能在一定场合下提早投降。四十两金子为数不小，且完全可能是从搜刮老百姓而来，加以没收，用于社会建设方面，于群众是有利益的。但是因为没有没收他的金子，使得视财如命的敌营长“大大感动，认识了一个真理：金子虽然值钱，但在解放区里，却有比金子更高贵的东西，这就是庄严的革命纪律”。我们这种伟大革命气魄的感召，使他感恩戴德，放了出去，走一地宣传一地，遇一人宣传一人，使成十成百的敌军官兵都会知道这一事实，足以降低他们的战斗意志。如此，比较来说，我们收到的效果比起四十两金子来就大的多了。
    我们要战胜反革命，一切应从较大较远的利益着眼，这就是政治。俘虏政策上不搜俘虏腰包，并没规定多少该没收，就是这个道理。
    所以我们认为这个金子如果确实不是公款，发还俘虏是对的。杨朔同志的报导，宣传了党的政策，没有什么错误。
