　　A Certain Political Department Implements the Mass Line
  　Good Experience in Mobilizing and Leading Civilian Labor
  　Northwest Field Political Department Orders All Departments to Study and Learn
    [Xinhua News Agency Northwest Front, 27th] The Political Department of the Northwest Field Army recently issued an order calling for the study and learning of the work experience of a certain political department in mobilizing and leading stretcher-bearer teams. This department adopted the mass line in the mobilization and management of stretcher-bearer teams. When mobilizing stretcher-bearers, this department insisted on relying on the masses, explained the tasks in coordination with local governments, district and village cadres, held democratic discussions, and helped the masses organize mutual aid in production to solve the difficulties of family production after the civilian laborers departed. After the stretcher-bearer team was formed, ideological education was carried out, common knowledge of first aid was taught, and a daily life order and management system were established, resulting in excellent performance of the stretcher-bearer team in service.
    Before the Huanglong Southern Line Campaign, this department sent personnel to a certain place to mobilize stretcher-bearers. They went to the countryside with district cadres and proposed a public mobilization method. Some local cadres did not approve, and a certain township head said: "Don't show your faces, let us do it." However, the department's personnel insisted on relying on the masses and public mobilization. After persuading a few local cadres, they convened village and township cadre meetings and mass meetings respectively. At the meeting, the masses were told about the situation of national victory, explaining that annihilating the Hu bandits was not only the demand of all the people in the Northwest, but also necessary to protect the interests of the local people, and that the masses were being mobilized to help the army carry stretchers. The number of stretchers and service dates were clearly stated at the meeting, and they would return home after the period expired, allowing everyone to have a democratic discussion. During the discussion, the masses realized that carrying stretchers was for themselves. Farmers in Baijiazu Village said: "Seeing that the wheat is about to be harvested, we will never let Hu Zongnan grab it. The army is fighting for us, so we should carry stretchers." After democratic evaluation of who should go, the discussion further extended to exchanging labor to help the stretcher-bearer team members harvest wheat.
    After the stretcher-bearer team was formed, ideological education was carried out to improve the class consciousness of the civilian laborers. At the same time, a strict daily life order and management system were gradually established, stipulating: morning exercises, political lessons or discussions in the morning, lectures and exercises on battlefield first aid and air defense in the afternoon, collective games after dinner, leave must be requested when going out, and comments are made during roll call at night, promoting the good and criticizing the bad. In life, a food management committee is elected by everyone, and the sick are sent to the hospital for treatment, with the same treatment as soldiers. This orderly and lively collective life reduced the civilian laborers' homesickness; lectures on first aid knowledge and air defense knowledge increased the civilian laborers' service skills and dispelled their concerns about being bombed by airplanes. The army cadres leading the stretcher-bearer team went deep into the grassroots to understand the team members' ideological trends. This approach strengthened the sense of responsibility and initiative of the cadres sent by the local government to lead the civilian laborers, and through them, united the party members and activists among the team members to become the core of promoting work.
    The morale of the team members has always been high, and a close relationship of unity has been maintained between the troops and the civilian laborers. In the rescue work, the civilian laborers not only made the wounded comfortable but also quickly transferred the wounded to the hospital. The wounded were very appreciative. Many team members were very brave, and some persisted in performing their tasks even though they were injured. After the battle, the department's health department presented a banner of "Model Stretcher-Bearer Team" at the farewell meeting for the stretcher-bearer team to return home.

　　某部政治部贯彻群众路线
  　动员领导民工经验好
  　西北野政训令各部研究学习
    【新华社西北前线二十七日电】西北野战军政治部顷颁发训令，号召研究与学习某部政治部动员与领导担架队的工作经验。该部对于担架队之动员与管理采取了群众路线。该部在动员担架时，坚持依靠群众，在地方政府、区村干部协同配合下，说明任务，民主讨论，并帮助群众组织生产互助，解决民工出发后家庭生产的困难；在担架队组成后，即进行思想教育，讲述救护常识，建立日常生活秩序与管理制度，致该部担架队在服务中成绩优良。
    黄龙南线战役前，该部派员赴某地动员担架。他们协同区干部下乡，提出公开动员办法。地方干部中有的不赞成，某乡长说：“你们不要露面，由我们去进行。”但该部人员坚持依靠群众、公开动员的方式，在说服了少数地方干部之后，乃分别召开了乡村干部会议与群众大会。会上向群众讲解全国胜利形势，说明歼灭胡匪不但是全西北人民的要求，而且是保卫本地人民利益所必需，特来动员群众帮助军队抬担架。会上明确提出担架数目及服务日期，期满后即回家，让大家进行民主讨论。在讨论中群众认识了抬担架是为自己。白家咀村农民说：“眼看麦要收了，决不让胡宗南抢去。军队为咱们打仗，咱们就该去抬担架。”经过民主评议了谁应该去后，就进一步讨论了变工，帮助担架队人员收麦。
    担架队集中组成后，即进行思想教育，提高民工的阶级觉悟。同时逐渐建立严密的生活秩序与管理制度，规定：早晨出操，上午上政治课或开讨论会，下午讲授和演习战地救护和防空，晚饭后集体游戏，出外必须请假，晚上点名时进行讲评，发扬好的，批评不好的。在生活上由大家选举伙食管理委员会，有病送医院治疗，和战士一样待遇。这种有秩序又活泼的集体生活，减少了民工的想家观念；讲授救护常识和防空常识，增加民工的服务技能并解除其怕飞机轰炸的顾虑。领导担架队的军队干部，则深入下层，了解队员思想动态，这样作很能加强地方政府派来带领民工的干部的责任心和积极性，经过他们去团结队员中的党员，积极分子成为推动工作的核心。
    该队民工情绪一贯高涨，部队与民工间，保持亲密的团结关系。民工在救护工作中不仅使伤员安适，并能迅速将伤员转到医院。伤员都很称赞。很多队员很勇敢，有的虽已负伤，仍坚持执行任务。战役结束后，该部卫生部在欢送担架队回家的大会上，特赠予“模范担架队”的锦旗一面。
