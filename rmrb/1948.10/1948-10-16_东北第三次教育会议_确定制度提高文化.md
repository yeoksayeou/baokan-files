Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 12th. The Northeast Liberated Area held its Third Education Conference from September 14th to 30th. The conference believed that the education work in the Northeast Liberated Area had made great achievements in the past year and a half. In terms of secondary education, according to the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast Political Committee's policy of winning over and transforming intellectuals, ideological education was universally carried out in various middle schools, breaking the blind orthodox concepts among educated youth, initially establishing revolutionary ideas against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, winning over more than 200,000 middle school students to participate in work and enter cadre schools, and absorbing a large number of children of the working people into middle schools. In terms of primary education, development has also been quite rapid in recent years. Peasants in various places have set up primary schools on their own, and a large number of peasant children have poured into schools. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 17,700 primary schools in the region, with more than 1,688,000 students; compared with last year, the number of schools has increased by 72.5 percent, and the number of students has increased by 90.8 percent. According to statistics from Hejiang Province, the number of primary school students has increased by one and a half times compared to the puppet Manchukuo period. At the same time, the conference pointed out that there were also many shortcomings and errors in the education work of the past year and a half, including the "leftist" deviations that had occurred in middle schools in some areas but had been corrected, as well as the spontaneous phenomena and the tendency of extreme democratization in school life that still exist in primary education. The conference believes that in the future, with the needs of the war situation and construction, the education work in the Northeast must move forward, embark on a new type of regularization, and make long-term plans. The conference held heated discussions on the general guiding principles and tasks of education work, the school system, curriculum, teachers, education funding, education policies for new areas, and the treatment of faculty and staff in primary and secondary schools, and formulated preliminary plans for review and implementation. At the closing of the conference, Lin Feng, Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, and Che Xiangchen, Minister of Education, attended and delivered speeches, and Dong Chuncai, Deputy Minister of Education, made a concluding report. In his speech, Chairman Lin Feng first pointed out that the central task of the rear work in the Northeast Liberated Area is production and construction and support for the war. To cooperate with this central task, all levels of education authorities are required to train a large number of cadres and young intellectuals with specialized knowledge and progressive ideas. The most needed cadres in the Northeast at present are in education, industry, agriculture, railways, post and telecommunications, health, and administrative work, and training these cadres is the central task of current education work. Secondly, leadership should be strengthened in national education, especially attention should be paid to the restoration and development of rural primary schools after the land reform, and primary schools should be added in workers' areas and poor areas in cities. Regarding the school system, Chairman Lin Feng said: Long-term plans should be made, there should be a formal school system, there should be a certain level to enroll, and there should be a certain number of years and a certain level to graduate. Only in this way can cadres with a certain level of theory and technology be trained. However, there is still an urgent need for various work cadres today, and short-term training courses cannot be cancelled. Regarding school life, Chairman Lin Feng said: Schools should have a strong atmosphere of learning, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, learn cultural science, political theory, and various knowledge. At the same time, a correct teacher-student relationship should be established in the school; suppressing democracy is wrong, and extreme democracy is also wrong. The task of students is to study well, and the task of teachers is to teach well. Teachers and students should cooperate to run the school well. When talking about education work cadres, Chairman Lin Feng emphasized that the most important thing is to train and use the original teachers in large quantities, and earnestly urged everyone to recognize that the old intellectuals in various fields are the wealth left over from the old society. We must accept this part of the wealth, unite them, and help them clear away old ideas and viewpoints and move forward. Governments at all levels should be responsible for improving the political life of educators. Middle school principals in counties with appropriate conditions can participate in the administrative meetings of the county government, and complete primary school principals in districts with appropriate conditions can participate in the meetings of the district government. Educators can participate in the on-the-job cadre studies organized by the local government to suit their needs in order to help the connection between education work and practical work. Finally, Chairman Lin encouraged everyone to continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, settle down in education work, delve into their specialties, and shoulder one of the basic tasks of building this new society.

In his concluding report, Deputy Minister of Education Dong Chuncai focused on the issue of the formal school system. He said: All levels of schools should stipulate a certain period of study, admission conditions, graduation standards, class hours, holidays, and examination systems. Students generally should not be transferred before graduation. Those who are unqualified should not be admitted when recruiting new students, but appropriate care should be given to poor and out-of-school youth, such as opening remedial classes for them. In terms of curriculum, primary and secondary schools must pay attention to cultural learning in the future. In the general middle school curriculum, various cultural courses should account for 90 percent, and political common sense courses should account for 10 percent. In normal schools, various cultural courses should account for 70 to 75 percent, political courses should account for 10 percent, and vocational courses should account for 15 to 20 percent. The Northeast Political Committee has decided that education funding will occupy a fixed position in all expenditures. Middle and above schools and urban primary schools are mainly run by the public, while rewarding private schools. Rural primary schools adopt the method of public assistance by the people. Teachers' salaries will be appropriately increased.

Regarding the education policy in the newly liberated areas, Comrade Dong Chuncai pointed out: The basic policy in the new areas is to maintain the status quo in general while making necessary and possible improvements, and adopt a gradual improvement policy so that schools can quickly resume classes. Except for those reactionary things with feudal and buying-off fascist toxins, such as the Kuomintang's civic education class and the Kuomintang's training system, which must be abolished, the rest will be temporarily retained.

At the end of the meeting, Minister of Education Che Xiangchen delivered a closing speech. He expressed his condolences to all education workers in the Northeast for their hard work in the past year and a half; at the same time, he called on all education workers in the Northeast to study policies and improve themselves in order to shoulder the current major tasks.

　　东北第三次教育会议
  　确定制度提高文化
    【新华社东北十二日电】东北解放区于九月十四日至三十日举行了第三次教育会议。会议认为过去一年半中，东北解放区教育工作是有很大成绩的。在中学教育方面，根据中共中央东北局和东北政委会关于争取和改造知识分子的方针，在各中学中普遍地进行了思想教育，打破了知识青年中盲目的正统观念，初步建立了反帝反封建和反官僚资本的革命思想，争取了二十余万个中学生参加工作和升入干部学校，并吸收了大批劳动人民的子弟进入中学。小学教育方面年来发展也相当迅速。各地农民纷纷自办小学，大批农民子弟涌入学校。据不完全统计，最近全区共有小学一万七千七百余所，学生达一百六十八万八千余名；与去年相较，学校增加百分之七十二点五，学生增加百分之九十点八。据合江省统计，小学生人数较伪满时增加一倍半。同时，会议指出，过去一年半的教育工作中，也有不少缺点和错误，包括在某些地区中学中曾发生过的但已纠正的左的偏向，以及小学教育中现在仍然存在着的自流现象和学校生活中的极端民主化倾向。会议认为：今后随着战争形势和建设的需要，东北教育工作必须向前推进一步，走上新型正规化，作长期打算。会议对于教育工作总的方针任务，中小学校的学制、课程、师资、教育经费、新区教育方针、教职员待遇等问题，均展开热烈的讨论，并拟定了初步方案，呈核实施。会议闭幕时，东北行政委员会主席林枫、教育部长车向忱均出席讲话，并由教育部副部长董纯才作总结报告。林枫主席在讲话中首先指出：目前东北解放区后方工作的中心任务是生产建设和支援战争。为配合这一中心任务，就要求各级教育机关培养大批各种各样的有专门知识、有进步思想的干部和青年知识分子。东北当前最需要的是教育、工业、农业、铁路、邮电、卫生及行政工作的干部，培养这些干部就是当前教育工作的中心任务。其次，应该加强领导国民教育，尤其是应该注意土地改革以后农村小学的恢复和发展，在城市里则应在工人区域与贫民区域增设小学。关于学制问题，林枫主席说：要作长期打算，要有正规的学制，要有一定的程度才能入学，要有一定的年限和一定的程度才能毕业，只有这样，才能培养出有一定程度的理论的和技术的干部。但今天仍急需各种工作干部，短期的训练班还不能取消。关于学校生活，林枫主席说：学校要有浓厚的学习空气，在毛泽东思想的指导下，学习文化科学、政治理论及各种知识。同时在学校里还应该建立起一种正确的师生关系；压制民主是不对的，极端民主也是不对的。学生的任务是学好，教员的任务是教好，师生应合作把学校办好。林枫主席于谈及教育工作干部时，着重指出最主要的是要大量培养与使用原有的教员，并谆谆敦促大家认识旧有的各方面的知识分子是旧社会遗留下来的财富，我们要接受这部分财富，要团结他们，帮助他们清除旧的思想和观点，向前进步。各级政府应当负责改善教育工作者的政治生活。各县的条件适当的中学校长，可以参加县政府的行政会议，各区的条件适当的完小校长可以参加区政府的会议，教育工作者可以参加当地政府所组织的适合他们需要的在职干部学习，以便帮助教育工作和实际工作的联系。林主席最后勉励大家继续发扬埋头苦干的精神安心于教育工作，钻研专业负担起这个新社会建设的基本任务之一。
    教育部副部长董纯才于总结报告中着重谈及正规学制问题。他说：各级学校都应规定一定的修业期限、入学条件、毕业标准、上课时间、放假日期以及考试制度等。学生未毕业一般不得抽调。招收新生时不合格的不收，但对贫苦失学青年应予适当的照顾，例如为他们开办补习班。课程方面，今后中小学必须注意文化学习。一般中学课程的比重，各种文化课应占百分九十，政治常识课占百分之十。师范学校各种文化课应占百分之七十到七十五，政治课占百分之十，业务课占百分之十五到二十。教育经费，东北政委会已决定其在全部开支中占一固定地位。中等以上学校和城镇小学，以公办为主，同时奖励私人办学。乡村小学则采民办公助办法。教员薪水将予适当提高。
    关于新解放区的教育方针问题，董纯才同志指出：新区的基本方针是在一般维持原状的情况下加以必要和可能的改良，采取逐渐改进的政策，使学校可以很快地复学。除对那些反动的有封建买办法西斯毒素的东西，如国民党的公民课和国民党的训导制度等必须废除外，其余暂存其旧。
    会议最后由教育部长车向忱致闭幕词。他对过去一年半来东北全体教育工作者的辛苦勤劳，表示慰问；同时号召全东北教育工作者应研究政策，提高自己，以便负起当前的重大任务。
