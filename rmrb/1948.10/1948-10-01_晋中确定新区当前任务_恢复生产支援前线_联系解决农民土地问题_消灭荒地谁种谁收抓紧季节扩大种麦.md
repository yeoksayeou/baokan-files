Jinzhong News: The Jinzhong District Party Committee convened a New District Work Conference in late August to determine the current work guidelines and tasks for the new Jinzhong districts. The Jinzhong New District currently has two major tasks: one is production, and the other is supporting the front lines. According to the current situation, on the one hand, the masses in the new districts have greatly reduced their labor and livestock power under the Yan thief's "soldier-farmer integration" tyranny and plunder, and people's lives are extremely poor. In areas such as Shouyang, Yuci, and Taiyuan County, households without grain account for 10% to 20%, and wasteland accounts for 15% to 50%. In individual villages, the wasteland accounts for as much as 70%, and deaths from starvation are very serious. For example, in Xiaoxiang, Luocheng, and Xinghua Village along the Tai-Fen Road in Fenyang, several hundred people died in one village from this spring to before and after the summer harvest. Rural productivity has been severely damaged. On the other hand, the work of planting wheat and the autumn harvest needs to be started quickly, but the land problem has been thrown into chaos by the "soldier-farmer integration" and also urgently needs to be solved. In order to take care of the production season and not affect support for the front, it has been determined that this year's production in the new districts should focus on restoring production, combined with solving the land problem. The land situation in the Jinzhong New District is generally of two types: one is that the land was adjusted after the great counter-offensive in 1945 and the May 4th Directive, and then Yan's bandits implemented "soldier-farmer integration." Therefore, the land in these areas is mostly divided in name but not in reality. The other type of area is where Yan's bandits thoroughly implemented "soldier-farmer integration" and never adjusted the land at all. Only a small number of areas have neither implemented "soldier-farmer integration" nor adjusted the land. The characteristic of the "soldier-farmer integration" area is that the land of both landlords and farmers actually belongs to Yan Xishan. Although "allotments" are nominally划了, they are actually acting as serfs for Yan Xishan. Those without labor or with insufficient labor, such as women, the elderly, and the weak, do not get land. Farmers without "allotments" account for 30% to 40%. However, a tenant-style land relationship does not exist in this type of area. Almost all of the labor harvest is plundered by Yan's bandits, and the farmers suffer a more cruel oppression and exploitation. Society regresses to a backward and barbaric serf era.

In order to quickly solve these land problems and step up wheat planting, the following solution has been decided: In areas where land has been adjusted in the past, that is, in areas where land has been reduced in rent and interest and evenly distributed under the leadership of the democratic government of the liberated areas and the land already belongs to the farmers, the land will be returned to the original owner (that is, to the farmers who obtained the land after the land adjustment). A three-seven split of the green crops will be adopted, or a split of the autumn harvest, with the planter getting 70% and the land divider (original owner) getting 30%. If a counter-settling landlord takes back the land of the farmer and turns it into black land for rent or employs workers to operate it, the farmer and the employee or tenant will solve the issue by dividing the green crops by three-sevenths (the counter-settling landlord does not get a share). In areas where the land has not been adjusted, except for the green seedlings grown by large landlords and evil tyrant landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements, which are distributed to landless farmers, the rest will be resolved according to the principle of "whoever cultivates it, reaps it" and the principle of adjustment. However, regardless of large landlords or evil tyrant landlords, they themselves and their families must be given a share of land; counter-revolutionary elements themselves cannot be given land, but their families must be given a share. The sources of land for adjustment are: (A) Enemy military land (referring to public land, temple land, and communal land that has been occupied by Yan's bandits. As for land forcibly occupied from farmers and poor anti-Japanese, cadres, and martyrs' families, it should not be adjusted). (B) Land of soldier-farmer rich peasants (that is, self-operated land that has become rich peasant land by relying on Yan's bandits' "soldier-farmer integration"). (C) Land stolen and occupied by traitors, bullies, and enemy puppet personnel. The above three sources will be used to solve the land and grain problems of landless farmers. If the above three methods do not reach 70% (the number of adjusted lands should not be less than 70% of the average number of the whole village, nor should it exceed it), a part can be transferred from those who have more land to solve the problem, and then there is no need to divide the green crops by three-sevenths. The main thing is to adopt the above three methods, and the latter is an auxiliary method. In areas where neither "soldier-farmer integration" has been implemented nor land has been adjusted, it is necessary to look at the subjective and objective conditions. Land can be adjusted, or rent and interest can be reduced, depending on the opinions of the masses. The situation in this type of area is estimated to be not very serious, and methods such as mutual assistance, loans, and relief can be adopted to solve the difficulty of grain and seeds. For the wheat land for planting wheat this year, it is determined that the farmers' land belongs to the farmers, and appropriate adjustments will be made for landless farmers. If the above-mentioned adjustment methods still cannot be solved, a part can be adjusted from small and medium landlords and even rich peasants, and it is determined that whoever plants the wheat land this year will reap the harvest. Regarding wasteland, in order to encourage wasteland reduction, it is determined that those who cultivate the cultivated wasteland (this year's and last year's wasteland) will have their public grain reduced by 50% next year; those who cultivate virgin wasteland will be exempt from public grain for one year next year. Whoever opens the public wasteland will own it. Those who leave the land wasteland without reason will still bear the original burden. Villages that have already solved the land problem and the green crop distribution problem will not be changed if the majority of the masses have no objections.

　　晋中确定新区当前任务
    恢复生产支援前线
    联系解决农民土地问题
    消灭荒地谁种谁收抓紧季节扩大种麦
    【晋中讯】晋中区党委于八月下旬召开新区工作会议，确定目前晋中新区工作方针和任务。晋中新区目前有两大任务：一为生产，一为支前。根据目前情况，一方面新区群众在阎贼“兵农合一”暴政劫掠下，劳畜力大为减少，人民生活极端贫困，如寿阳、榆次、太原县一带，无粮户占百分之十到百分之二十，荒地占百分之十五到百分之五十，个别村庄竟有荒下百分之七十左右的，饿死和死亡现象很严重。如太汾路沿线汾阳之小相、罗城、杏花村，从今春到夏收前后，有一村死亡数百人的。农村生产力受到严重损坏。另一方面是种宿麦和秋收工作需要很快动手，但土地问题被“兵农合一”搅的混乱不堪，也急需解决。为照顾生产季节，又不使支前受到影响，确定今年新区的生产应以恢复生产为中心，联系解决土地问题。晋中新区的土地情况一般有两种：一种是在一九四五年大反攻及五四指示后，调剂过土地，后又被阎匪实行了“兵农合一”，因此，这些地区土地大部是明分暗不分。另一种地区是阎匪彻底实行了“兵农合一”，根本未调剂过土地。既未实行“兵农合一”又未调剂土地的地区，只占少数。“兵农合一”区的特点，是地主和农民的土地实际都归了阎锡山所有，虽然表面上划了“份地”，实际上是给阎锡山当农奴，没有劳动力或缺少劳动力的妇女老弱，得不到土地，这种无“份地”农民占百分之卅至百分之四十。但租佃式的土地关系在此种地区并不存在，劳动收获几全被阎匪抢掠，农民所受的是一种更加残酷的压榨和剥削，社会倒退到落后野蛮的农奴时代。
    为迅速解决这些土地问题加紧种麦，决定了解决办法是：在过去已经调剂土地的地区，即在解放区民主政府领导下，进行过减租减息平分土地而土地已经归了农民的地区，地归原主（即归回在调剂土地后得到土地的农民）。采取三七分青，或分秋，种地户得七成，分地户（原主）得三成。倒算地主将拿回农民之土地变成黑地出租或雇工经营者，农民与雇工或租种人按三七分青解决（倒算地主不分）。在没有调剂过土地的地区，除了大地主和恶霸地富反革命分子自种的青苗分给无地的农民外，其余按谁种谁收和调剂原则解决。但不论大地主恶霸地主，其本人及家属必须分给一份土地；反革命分子本人不能分地，其家属必须分给一份。调剂土地的来源：（甲）敌人的军田（指公地、庙地、社地之被阎匪占去之土地。至于强占农民及贫苦抗、干、烈属之土地，则不应调剂）。（乙）兵农地富之土地（即依仗阎匪“兵农合一”成为地富之自营土地）。（丙）确系汉奸、恶霸敌伪人员所窃取霸占的土地。用上述三种来源，解决无地农民的土地、口粮。如上述三种办法到不了百分之七十（调剂土地数目，不低于全村平均数字百分之七十，亦不必超过），可从分地多的人抽调一部分解决，这时就不用三七分青了。主要采取上述三种办法，后一种是辅助办法。在既未实行“兵农合一”又未调剂过土地的地区，要看主客观条件，可调剂土地，亦可实行减租减息，要根据群众意见进行。这种地区的情况估计不大严重，可采取互助、贷款、救济等办法，解决口粮种籽困难。今年种宿麦之麦地，确定农民土地归农民，无地农民适当的进行调剂。如前述几种调剂办法尚解决不了时，可从中小地主以至富农调剂一部分，并确定今年麦地谁种归谁收。关于荒地，为了鼓励减荒，确定开种熟荒者（今年去年之荒地），明年公粮减征百分之五十；开种生荒者，明年免征公粮一年。公荒谁开归谁，无故荒地者负担照旧。已经解决了土地问题、分青问题的村子。如大多数群众已无意见者，即不再变更。
