Military Debacle · Depleted Troop Resources
    The Kuomintang Frantically Drags Men into Service; Young People Flee in Droves
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] According to a compilation of Kuomintang-controlled newspapers, the Kuomintang, amidst military defeats and dwindling troop resources, is frantically conscripting men in various areas. Qingdao city's conscription target for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic (1948) is 7,379 men, five times more than the 1,500 plus men conscripted during the first round in June of this year, plunging the entire city into conscription terror. Guangdong Province's conscription quota for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic reaches 39,000 men. Among them, Guangzhou city's conscription quota is 1,700 men. In mid-August, the Guangzhou puppet municipal government formulated extremely barbaric measures for controlling eligible men, stipulating that men's residence, movement, and outings must be guaranteed by "joint guarantee" of the men themselves or a shop guarantee. In addition, they concocted various pretexts to extort money under the guise of so-called "new recruit resettlement fees." In mid-August, the fee in Guangzhou city had already increased to six shi (approximately 60 kg) of rice per person, and it will increase to eight shi when the quota cannot be met by the deadline. In You Tou City, it has already increased to ten shi of rice.
    The Kuomintang's conscription atrocities are deepening the disorder of social order in its controlled areas and arousing resistance from those conscripted. According to a proposal passed by the Kuomintang Guangdong Provincial Assembly on August 10th: "Conscription malpractice has become an open secret. Recently, as the government ordered troops to be sent as urgently as sparks, the situation has led to the tragedy of indiscriminate conscription, resulting in social disorder and widespread panic. The facilities in the places where conscripted men are concentrated are poor, and there is insufficient nutrition, resulting in frequent illnesses and deaths." On August 1st, a member of the Kuomintang Hunan Provincial Assembly stated: Conscription malpractices are rampant, with people being seized at night, and substitutions being bought and sold, leading to a sharp decline in rural production. It is reported that the Kuomintang army in Jingjiang city, Jiangsu, is using barbaric methods to carry out conscription, stipulating that young students over 18 years old studying in junior high school and over 21 years old studying in senior high school are all considered "evading military service." Young people in the city are fleeing in droves, and most shops are left with only women to handle business. Students at a middle school in northern Jiangsu decided to live collectively on campus from September 1st, not leaving the campus during the day, and closing the school gate tightly at night. If anyone comes to conscript, everyone will climb onto the roof and use bricks and tiles to resist. One day, some men returned home from outside the city and more than 20 people were seized that night. Later, regardless of teachers, students, shop assistants, or workers, as long as they were young men, they were dragged away by armed soldiers in cooperation with puppet township chiefs. From the 2nd, young people fled to the liberated areas in an endless stream. Two or thirty shop assistants from San You Cloth Shop, Shi Li Tea and Food Shop, and other shops in the city have found jobs in Guangling Town in the liberated area. According to an Associated Press report from Nanjing on September 30th, citing newspaper reports: 118 new recruits from Anhui mutinied on the "Zhixing" (transliteration) ship on their way to Nanjing, seizing weapons and killing two escorting captains. Two-thirds of the mutinying recruits escaped, and some still carry weapons.

　　军事惨败·兵源枯竭
    国民党疯狂抓丁  青壮年纷纷逃避
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合国民党区报纸消息：国民党在军事惨败、兵源枯竭中，正在各地疯狂抓捕壮丁。青岛市三十七年度下半年征兵七千三百七十九名，比今年六月间第一次征兵额一千五百多名多五倍，全市陷入抓丁恐怖中。广东省三十七年度下半年征兵名额达三万九千名。其中广州市应征名额为一千七百名，广州伪市府于八月中旬拟定极其蛮横的管制适龄壮丁办法，规定壮丁居住、移动、外出均须壮丁“连保”或铺保。此外更巧立名目，用所谓“新兵安家费”进行勒索，八月中旬广州市每名已提高至大米六市担，到期不能募足时将增至八市担。油头市则已增至大米十市担。
    国民党抓丁暴行，正加深其统治区社会秩序的紊乱与激起被抓壮丁的反抗。据八月十日国民党广东省参议会所通过的议案称：“征兵舞弊已属公开之秘密，近以政府责令送兵急如星火，情势所迫，遂有滥拉壮丁之惨剧，以致社会秩序紊乱，人心惶惶。集中壮丁地方设备不良，营养不足，致患病及死亡者时有所闻”。八月一日国民党湖南省参议会一议员称：兵役弊端丛生，黑夜抓人，买卖顶替，使农村生产锐减。据悉，江苏靖江城国民党军用野蛮手段进行抓丁，规定十八岁以上读初中及廿一岁以上读高中的青年学生，都算“逃避兵役”。城内青壮年纷纷逃避，大部店家只剩下女人应付门市买卖。苏北中学学生决定自九月一日起集体住宿校内，白天不出校门，晚上严闭校门，如来抓丁，大家就爬上屋用砖瓦抵抗。某日有部分壮丁自城外回家，当夜即被抓去廿多人。后来不管教师、学生、店员、工人，只要是青年男子就被武装兵士配合伪乡保长沿门拉走。从二日起，向解放区逃避的青年络绎不绝。该城三友布店、时利茶食店等二三十名店员，已在解放区广陵镇找到职业。据美联社南京九月三十日引报纸消息：安徽新兵一百一十八名，于被押送赴南京途中在“直兴”（译音）轮上哗变，夺取武器，杀死押解的上尉两名，哗变新兵中有三分之二已逃脱，若干人尚携有武器。
