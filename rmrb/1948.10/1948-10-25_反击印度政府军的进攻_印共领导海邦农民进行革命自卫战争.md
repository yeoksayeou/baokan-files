　　Counterattacking the Offensive of the Indian Government Army
  　Indian Communists Lead Hyderabad Peasants in a Revolutionary War of Self-Defense
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd】Electone News Agency, Madras, 8th: The Indian government's war against the Hyderabad State is rapidly transforming into an offensive against the people of Hyderabad, especially the revolutionary peasants of the already liberated areas of Nalgonda and Warangal districts (both located in eastern Hyderabad, near Madras Province). Leading this offensive is Chaudhuri, the defeated commander-in-chief of the Indian army of the Hyderabad Prince. Chaudhuri admits that to clear these areas, his army will be drawn into "large-scale operations."
    Note: The Indian army launched a war against Hyderabad on September 13. This war had two purposes: first, to suppress the powerful Hyderabad peasant movement led by the Indian Communists; and second, to defeat the Hyderabad Prince and incorporate Hyderabad into India. The Indian government is waging a war of aggression, while the Hyderabad Prince, who once suppressed the peasant movement and relied on the support of Britain and Pakistan, is only waging a war to ensure feudal rule. After the Hyderabad Prince surrendered, the current war is, on the one hand, a counter-revolutionary war jointly waged by the Nehru government and the Hyderabad Prince, and on the other hand, a revolutionary war of self-defense waged by the Hyderabad peasants under the leadership of the Indian Communists. The Hyderabad peasant riots broke out in 1946, and more than two thousand villages with a total population of approximately five million have been liberated from the old rule. People's committees, courts, and armies have been established in the liberated areas, and the landlords' land has been distributed to landless peasants. The Hyderabad government's army once "suppressed" the liberated areas, but the people's army and the people's resistance have always maintained an unyielding position.

### 反击印度政府军的进攻　印共领导海邦农民进行革命自卫战争

　　反击印度政府军的进攻
  　印共领导海邦农民进行革命自卫战争
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】电通社马德拉斯八日讯：印度政府对海德拉巴土邦的战争，正迅速转化为对海邦人民、特别是对已经解放了的纳冈达与瓦兰加尔两地区（俱位于海邦东部，靠近马德拉斯省）之革命农民的进攻。领导这一进攻的是被击败了的海邦大君印军总司令曹德利。曹德利承认，要肃清这些地区，将使他的军队卷进“大规模的作战”中。
    按：印度军队于九月十三日向海德拉巴发动战争，这一战争有两个目的，第一是镇压印共领导的强大的海邦农民运动，第二是打败海邦大君并使海邦并入印度。印度政府进行的是侵略战争，而曾经镇压农民运动并依靠英国和巴基斯坦支持的海邦大君，进行的仅仅是为了确保封建统治的战争。海邦大君投降后，目前的战争一方面是尼赫鲁政府和海邦大君联合进行的反革命战争，另一方面是海邦农民在印共领导下进行的革命自卫战争。海邦的农民暴动爆发于一九四六年，总数约五百万人口的两千余乡村已从旧的统治下解放出来。人民的委员会、法庭与军队已在解放区内建立，地主的土地已经分给无地的农民。海邦政府的军队，曾经“清剿”过解放区，但是，人民的军队和人民的抗争一直都保持着不屈的地位。
