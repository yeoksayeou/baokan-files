Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 20th: The powerful artillery units of the East China People's Liberation Army made a significant contribution in the recent battle to liberate Jinan. Whether in clearing enemy outposts or in attacking the city, the Nationalist army's strong fortifications were shattered by the unparalleled power of our artillery fire.

When the attack on Maoling Mountain, the "Jinan Gateway" in the southeast suburbs, began on the night of September 16th, our heroic artillery destroyed the enemy's high bunker with only twelve heavy shells, covering the infantry's capture of the mountain. On the 17th, when attacking Yanchi Mountain, our artillery fired thirty-nine shells, hitting thirty-six of them. When capturing Yanchi Mountain, the location of the enemy artillery observation post in the eastern suburbs, an enemy battalion maneuvered down the mountain in an attempt to counterattack. Our artillery first surrounded the enemy with dense fire, then fiercely bombarded the core fortifications on the mountaintop, and then destroyed the twelve bunkers on the mountain one by one, enabling the infantry to successfully complete the mountain assault. On the third day of the battle (September 18th), in the afternoon, the Jinan West Suburb Airport was subjected to long-range bombardment by our army's heavy artillery from over 10,000 meters away. After two transport planes landed and couldn't take off, no third plane came.

During the outer perimeter battles, the powerful firepower of the People's Liberation Army not only coordinated with the infantry to clear the enemy's strongholds but also completely suppressed the enemy's artillery fire. On the morning of the 17th, the enemy's howitzer moved to Hongjialou in the eastern suburbs but was spotted by our artillery observation post before it entered the position. In an instant, our howitzer concentrated its bombardment on it, and the enemy's howitzer became a "slippery cannon," turning around and running away. On the morning of the 18th, another four American-made howitzers, followed by two regiments of enemy troops, drove out of the city in an attempt to counterattack our army in the southeast suburbs. But as the enemy guns were being dismounted for construction and the enemy infantry were dispersing, the People's Liberation Army's volley guns roared together. Under the heavy casualties from shrapnel, the enemy troops retreated into the city.

In the city attack battle, at dusk on the 22nd, our artillery units fiercely bombarded the eastern city wall, opening a breach for the infantry and firing deep into the city to support the infantry's assault. The enemy on the meteorological station, the commanding height in the southeast corner of the city, attempted to prevent our assault troops from advancing, but they were immediately annihilated under the fierce bombardment of our artillery fire. At another breakthrough point, our artillery shell completely annihilated a squad of enemy troops attempting to counterattack. Two enemy bunkers at the foot of the city wall inside the city used a crossfire to block the deep development of our assault troops into the city, but they were immediately destroyed by our artillery. At the same time, the flames east of the airport burned red half of the sky, and our powerful artillery was fiercely bombarding Pulimen. The enemy's howitzer was completely silenced. After the second volley of artillery fire, our assault troops stormed into Pulimen. On the night of the 23rd, our artillery again concentrated its bombardment on the enemy's position on West Gate Street. At dawn on the 24th, after the second bombardment of the west wall of the inner city, the infantry rushed into the inner city. Inside and outside Pulimen, which had been baptized by the powerful artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army, enemy fortifications, armored vehicles, and tanks that had been hit and burned were still emitting white smoke until the second day of Jinan's liberation—the 25th. On the enemy vehicle position on West Gate Street, it was difficult to find a square meter of space without a crater. Dozens of vehicles and two howitzers and one Type 38 field gun lay destroyed in front of the provincial government gate.

During this battle, countless excellent gunners with one hundred hits out of one hundred shots emerged. The eighth company of a certain unit fired seventy-seven shells, and except for one that penetrated a bunker without exploding, all the rest hit and exploded. One gun in the company was ordered to destroy an enemy large bunker with every ten shells, and as a result, it destroyed three large bunkers with twenty-two shells, saving eight shells. Luo Xinli, the captured Wang bandit Yao Wu's chief of staff, said: "Your shells fell like raindrops, completely disrupting our command post. Our artillery was completely unable to function under the suppression of your artillery fire." The old people of Jinan said: "The Nationalists fire one cannon, and the Eighth Route Army returns ten. The Eighth Route Army's cannons have eyes, and the shells all land on the Nationalist positions." The commanders and fighters of our various infantry assault units encouraged and thanked the artillery units by telephone or letter. The ×th regiment of a certain unit also suggested that the higher authorities give the artillery a commendation. In their letter to the artillery commanders and fighters, they wrote: "Your coordination with us is too good, and we hope that we will cooperate better in the future battles to attack Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Nanjing."

### 解放济南战斗中　我炮兵发挥无比威力

　　解放济南战斗中
  　我炮兵发挥无比威力
    【新华社华东前线二十日电】华东解放军的强大炮兵部队，在这次解放济南战役中贡献极大。无论在扫除敌外围据点或在攻城战斗中，国民党军的强固工事，均为我军炮火的无比威力所粉碎。
    九月十六日夜开始进攻东南郊“济南大门”茂岭山时，我神勇炮兵仅以十二发巨弹就摧毁了敌人的高堡、掩护步兵攻占该山。十七日攻击砚池山时，我炮兵发炮三十九发即命中三十六发。在攻占东郊敌炮兵观察所所在地燕翅山时，敌人一个营从山上迂回下来，企图反扑，我炮兵先以密集炮火包围了敌人，继即猛轰山顶核心工事，然后逐一摧毁了山上的十二个地堡，使步兵胜利完成了攻山任务。在战役开始后的第三天（十八日）下午，济南西郊的飞机场，即受到我军重炮万米以上的远程轰击。在该机场上空的两架运输机降下来，飞不起外，再也没有第三架飞机来了。
    在外围战中，解放军的强大炮火威力，不仅配合步兵扫除了敌人的强固据点，并完全压制了敌人的炮火。十七日上午，敌人的榴弹炮运动到了东郊洪家楼，尚未进入阵地，即为我炮兵观察所发现。霎时我榴弹炮即对准它集中轰击，敌人的榴弹炮成了“溜窜炮”，回头就跑。十八日上午，又有四门美式榴弹炮跟着两个团的敌人从城内开出，企图向东南郊我军反扑。但当敌炮正在下架做工事，敌步兵正在分散运动时，解放军的排炮就一齐轰鸣起来。敌人在榴散弹的重大杀伤下溃回城内。
    在攻城战斗中，二十二日黄昏，我炮兵部队猛轰东城城垣，为步兵打开了突破口，并向纵深射击支援步兵的突击，城东南角制高点气象台守敌企图阻止我突击队前进，立即在我炮火猛轰下被歼。在另一个突破口上，我炮兵一发炮弹即将企图反扑的敌人一个班全部消灭。敌人在城内城墙脚下的两个地堡，以交叉火网封锁我突击队向城内纵深发展，当即为我炮兵摧毁。同时，在飞机场东面火光烧红了半边天，我强大炮兵正向普利门猛轰，敌人的榴弹炮完全成了哑吧。在第二阵排炮之后，我突击队即攻入了普利门。二十三日夜我炮队又集中轰击西门大街敌阵地。二十四日拂晓，向内城西墙的第二次轰击后，步兵即冲进了内城。经过解放军强大炮火洗礼的普利门内外，直到济南解放的第二天——二十五日，被击中燃烧的敌人工事，装甲车和坦克还冒着白烟。西门大街的敌车阵地上，更难找到一方公尺的地方没有弹坑。省府门前躺着被击毁的数十辆汽车和两门榴弹炮、一门三八式野炮。
    此次战役中，涌现了无数百发百中的出色的炮手。某部八连发炮七十七发，除一发钻入堡内未炸外，其余全部命中爆炸。该连有一门炮受命以每十发炮弹毁灭敌人一个大地堡，结果以二十二发摧毁了三个大地堡，节省了八发炮弹。被俘的王匪耀武的参谋长罗辛理说：“你们的炮弹象雨点一样直往下落，把我们指挥所完全打乱了。我们的炮在你们的炮火压制下，完全不能发挥作用。”济市的老百姓则说：“国民党打一炮八路军就还他十炮。八路军的炮有眼睛，炮弹都落在国民党的阵地上的。”我各步兵攻击部队的指战员们都用电话或写信鼓励、感谢炮兵部队。某部×团并建议上级给炮兵记功。他们在给炮兵指战员的信上写道：“你们给我们的配合太好了，愿今后我们配合攻打徐州、蚌埠、南京的战斗中打得更好。”
