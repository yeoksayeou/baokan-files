[Ji-Lu-Yu Electric Dispatch] The entire Yellow River management staff of the North Second Section of the Kuomintang Shandong Repair and Defense Office (covering the four repair and defense sections under the jurisdiction of Qihe Chengs Hangnan Shui Niu Zhao Xian Gong to Queshan in the northeast of the city, originally named First, Second, Third, and Fourth Defense Flood Season, changed to the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Sections from August), feeling that the Kuomintang's Yellow River management organs were full of darkness and waste large amounts of public funds without carrying out Yellow River management projects; and also recognizing that the revolutionary war of the People's Liberation Army is winning victories one after another, and the complete collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary group is not far away, after the start of the Jinan Campaign, the head of the Third Section, Su Jinkui, led all the employees of the Third and Fourth Sections, with all the Yellow River management tools and materials such as lead wires, sacks, straw bales, and willow piles, to participate in the Yellow River management project in the liberated area. Soon after, Ma Fuyue, the head of the Seventh Section, and Jiang Lianjie, the head of the Sixth Section, also led their respective section employees, carrying all the Yellow River management materials, to participate. In total, more than eighty employees from the four sections came to participate, including more than twenty newly joined flood season soldiers. They joined our Qi-Yu Repair and Defense Section. Currently, the employees of the four sections have successively arrived at the north bank construction site from the south bank. This unifies the Yellow River management work from Kaifeng downwards. On September 30th, our Qi-Yu Repair and Defense Section held a welcome meeting at the Doufuwo Dangerous Work Site. Comrade Zhao Mingfu, Deputy Director of our Yellow River Committee, encouraged everyone to enthusiastically serve the people and explained that our government especially cherishes and treats technical personnel favorably. In his speech, the sixty-five-year-old Section Chief Su expressed his extreme indignation at the darkness and corruption within the Kuomintang bandit gang, recounting the suffering he had endured in the past, and stating that under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Yellow River management work was impossible to achieve. From his memory, the river had breached more than forty times. In the past, the work to manage the river was truly not fair to the people. He also expressed that everyone should study hard in the future and do the work well. After the meeting, Section Chiefs Ma and Jiang enthusiastically volunteered to go to Jinan to mobilize Yellow River management experts and technical personnel to participate in the Yellow River management work in the liberated area.

　　愤恨蒋匪治河机关黑暗腐败
  　敌治黄员工八十余人参加我齐禹修防工作
    【冀鲁豫电】国民党山东修防处北二段（齐河城上南水牛赵险工至城东北鹊山所辖四个修防分段，原名第一、第二、第三、第四防守汛，从八月改为第三、四、五、六分段）全体治黄员工，因感于国民党的治黄机关黑暗重重，经常虚耗了大批公款，而不进行治黄工程；又鉴于人民解放军的革命战争节节胜利，国民党反动集团的全部垮台已为期不远，在济南战役开始后，第三分段段长苏金奎遂率第三、四分段全体员工，带着全部治黄工具及铅丝、麻袋、稻草包、柳桩等器材，参加解放区的治黄工程。以后不久，第七分段段长马福岳及第六分段段长姜连捷也率各该分段员工，携带全部治黄器材，前来参加。总计四个分段前来参加员工共八十余名，内有新参加的汛兵二十余名。参加了我齐禹修防段。现该四个分段的员工已陆续从南岸开到北岸工段。这就使治黄工作从开封以下都统一联结起来。九月三十日，我齐禹修防段特于豆腐窝险工开欢迎大会。我黄委会副主任赵明甫同志勉励大家热心为人民服务，并说明我政府对技术人员特别爱护优待。六十五岁的苏分段长讲话中，对国民党匪帮内部的黑暗腐败非常愤慨，历述自己过去所受的痛苦，说明在国民党的反动统治下，治河工作根本没法实现。从他记事中开了四十多次口子。过去治河的真对不起老百姓。并表示以后咱都要好好学习，把工做得好好的。会后马、姜两位分段长均很热诚的自报奋勇要到济南去动员治河专家及技术人员前来参加解放区的治黄工作。
