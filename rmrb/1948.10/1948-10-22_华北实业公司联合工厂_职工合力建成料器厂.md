  　Workers Unite to Build Glassware Factory
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Joint Factory of North China Industrial Corporation (referred to as "Hualian") decided to establish a glassware factory in early August to solve the city's need for glass utensils. Despite the lack of manpower and equipment, the factory workers united and quickly completed the factory construction task, striving to start operations ahead of schedule. At the time of construction, technical workers could not be found for a while. In addition to Comrade Liu, the only technical worker, there were only six workers who did not understand the technology. Because there were few people and many things to do, everyone felt it was difficult. However, under the personal guidance of Factory Director Wang Xingui and technical worker Lao Liu, an old machine that had not been used for three years was cleaned, repaired, and assembled in two days. Within eight days, they dug a melting furnace pit with an area of 11.5 square meters and a depth of 1.5 meters, and a flue that was one meter wide, 1.5 meters deep, and 7.5 meters long. During the digging, large chunks of cement (waste left by the Japanese devils for installing machines) were constantly discovered. Regardless of fatigue, the workers used 40-pound sledgehammers to break them open. Within seven days, they completed a furnace that could melt more than 1,000 catties of glass. Finally, a 45-foot-high iron chimney had to be installed. If an iron factory was called to install it, the material cost would be too high. Everyone said they would do it themselves, overcoming the difficulty of not having tools. They used wooden poles crossed together, section by section, and erected it in five hours, saving more than 1.5 million yuan in construction costs, laying the foundation for rapid commencement of production. Twenty-two days after the start of operation, the factory held a meeting to inspect the finished products. It was found that some of the bottles were brittle, had uneven bottoms, crooked mouths, uneven thickness, unequal capacity, and had watermarks and bubbles on the surface. The first batch of bottles sold to the publicly owned liquor distillery broke by 10% when the caps were tightened. The reason for the damage was the crooked mouths of the bottles, which caused uneven stress on the bottle necks, resulting in poor quality. According to Lao Liu, "The thick bottom of the bottle is because, when blowing, if the mold is knocked open too early, the air will not go down, and the material will sink to the bottom, making the bottle walls uneven in thickness." Technician Li believed that the steam power was not enough. The existing steam pressure gauge only showed 60 pounds, and it should be replaced with a 100-pound one. It was also decided that the molds should be repaired to eliminate watermarks and bubbles. The technicians also believed that the process from shaping to large mold should be shortened to prevent the glass from cooling down too much and not blowing well. The crooked mouths were due to uneven hands when using pliers. It is best to fix one or two workers to use the pliers. Finally, Hua Yi, Director of North China Industrial Corporation, encouraged everyone to try their best to improve. He emphasized strict management, cost accounting, and material registration should be even stricter. Meetings should be held frequently to discuss ways to overcome shortcomings, and administrative staff must understand the production process to facilitate timely resolution of difficulties. In addition, the formulation of raw materials must be precise, and efforts should be made to improve quality.

  　职工合力建成料器厂
    【石家庄讯】华北实业公司联合工厂（简称华联）为解决市上玻璃器具需要，八月初决定建立料器厂，在人力器材缺乏条件下，由于该厂职工团结一致动手，速迅完成建厂任务，争取提前开工。建厂时，技术工人一时找不到，除技术工人刘同志一人外，只有六个不懂技术的工人，因人少事多，大家感觉困难，但在厂主任王新贵及技术工人老刘亲自动手指导下，两天内将一部三年未用的旧机器擦洗配装完毕，八天内挖好面积十一·五平方米、深一·五米的熔化炉坑，及宽一米、深一·五米、长七·五米的烟道，挖时不断发现很大的洋灰坨子（是日寇按装机器用的废物），工人不顾疲劳，用四十磅大锤打开，七天内完成了熔化千多斤玻璃的火炉。最后要按装四丈五尺高的铁烟突，若叫铁工厂按装，料费又太高，大家都说自己干，克服没有工具的困难，用木杆子交叉着一节一节的在五小时内架起来完成按装，节省一百五十余万元的修建费，打下迅速开工的基础。开工后二十二天，该厂开会检查成品，认为瓶子有些质量较脆、底不平、嘴口歪、厚薄不匀，容量不等、表面有水纹和气泡缺点，首批卖给公营露酒酿造厂的瓶子，在扎盖时坏了百分之十。损坏的原因是瓶的嘴口歪，瓶脖子受力不平衡，质量差。据老刘说：“瓶底厚是吹的时候，扣模子的要是敲得太早，气便下不去，料便沉到底，瓶壁就厚薄不匀。”李技师认为是汽力不够，现有的汽压表只有六十磅，应该换成一百磅的。并决定为了免除水纹和气泡应该修理模子。技师们还认为从成型到大模的过程要缩短，免得玻璃冷却吹不好。嘴口歪是拿钳子手不平的缘故，最好固定一个或两个工人拿钳。最后华北实业公司主任花怡更勖勉大家，尽力求改进，他强调严格管理，成本计算和材料登记更要严格。经常召集会议，商讨克服缺点的办法，行政人员必须了解生产过程，便于及时解决困难。此外，关于原料的配制要力求精确，努力提高质量。
