[Central Hebei Electric] After the early-maturing crops in various parts of central Hebei were harvested, they have now entered the stage of wheat planting. Party and government leading organs at all levels generally attach importance to production leadership, and have achieved many successes. However, some areas still have many shortcomings and serious deviations in leading production. (1) In many places, there is serious formalism and commandism in leading production. In organizing labor mutual aid, some areas are simply organizing "for the sake of organizing," and treat organizing mutual aid as separate from autumn harvest and wheat planting. Many cadres, after arriving in the village, do not investigate the existing mutual aid organizations, but immediately want results, pursuing form and numbers. In the sixth district and nine villages of Qingcangjiao (newly划县), 53 groups were organized in two days, many of which were falsely reported by village cadres to deal with district cadres. For example, Zhao Guanying only formed 21 groups according to the farmers' association小组. Many district cadres in the county regard autumn harvest and wheat planting as secondary, and simply engage in mutual aid. After the county party committee discovered these deviations, it did not clearly propose that the main purpose of organizing mutual aid is to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, but vaguely proposed "equal emphasis on organizing and planting wheat." Ningjin's ninth district and the villages in the Chengguan district reported organizing 302 groups, but in reality, only 39 groups were truly helping each other. An'guo's Dazhang village separated the men and women of a family, with the men participating in the men's group and the women participating in the women's group, making it impossible to unify the family's labor force. As a result, 37 groups were organized, but only two groups actually helped each other. Some areas do not proceed from the specific situation, make big plans, empty slogans "guarantee how to do," and blindly launch unrealistic "challenges." Some people admit at the meeting how many mutual aid groups they have organized. Chengguan district forced businessmen to join mutual aid groups. There were originally 11 mutual aid groups in Xingfu Village in the district. After receiving the challenge letter from Desheng Village, in order to cope with the challenge, they wanted to break the 11 groups into 30 or 40 groups. There are also those who, regardless of the specific conditions of the place, excessively force party members and cadres to take the lead. For example, the district cadres of the fifteenth district of Shulu forced each party member and cadre in Mudian Village to organize a group. The district cadres of the thirteenth district of Jianguo ordered the party members and cadres of Zhongwangda Village to be fully organized before the 17th day of the eighth lunar month, and to sow all the first crop of wheat and plow the second crop. Ma Yongxin, the secretary of the tenth district, called on cadres and party members in Lao Zhuangzi to take the lead in planting more wheat. The village cadres said: "The land is dry and we cannot plant more." Comrade Ma insisted on asking the village cadres to plant more. The village cadres said anxiously, "We will plant more, it doesn't matter if we throw away some seeds, but who will compensate the masses if they throw them away!" Comrade Dong, a district cadre in the eleventh district of Jinghai, forced 22 boat households in Sun Village to cooperate with the masses. The boat owners disagreed. The next day, Comrade Dong saw a boat by the village and shouted that they didn't come. He even threatened them with a gun. When a district cadre of Qingcangjiao held a meeting in Jinzhuangzi, he called out: "Find targets tomorrow morning, join together at noon, and the小组 will report in the evening." He also said, "It is尖头 for those who have livestock not to join with those who do not." The next night, "nine groups were organized," but in reality, they were the original nine groups, each with two more military families. Female cadres in An'guo Beima forcibly led 162 women to harvest crops for military families for three days during the busy autumn harvest season. The district cadres also said this was "voluntary." In some villages in Qingcangjiao and Ningjin, when organizing mutual aid, the village cadres prepared it in advance and announced it at the mass meeting as an organization, completely violating the principle of voluntariness. (2) Most of the leading cadres in various places used the method of participating in production to lead production, but there are still many cadres who cannot put down their airs. After arriving in the village, some district cadres in An'guo and Renqiu only pay attention to wanting results and numbers, but rarely go deep into production to understand the masses' thoughts and concerns. Most of the cadres in the fourteenth district of Shulu did not help the masses in production. The district cadres working in Nanzhi Qiu only made calls at the conference and asked the village cadres for reports. Some cadres think that holding a few meetings is enough to complete the task. Some female cadres in Renhe and Dacheng even think that participating in production is a shame. When the district cadres of the second district of Suning went to the village to inspect the work, they slept and strolled around during the day, but were unwilling to go deep into the masses to lead production. When the secretary of the district party committee of Jianguo tenth district led production in Huangtun, he lived in a family for three days, rarely went out, and had to be taken care of by the village cadres. However, some district cadres in Jianguo, Qingcangjiao, and An'guo only help the masses in production, but cannot understand the production situation. Some cadres do not cherish the production time of the masses and village cadres in leading production. For example, after the cadres of the sixth district of Jianguo went to the countryside, they held meetings regardless of whether the masses were busy or not. When the villagers were busy harvesting along the village, they held 20 mass meetings in a row for 20 days. Since the end of August this year, Jinghe Village has held a mass meeting every day. The masses are very annoyed and do not speak at the meeting. The district cadres also complain that the masses are "backward." (3) The phenomenon of neglecting the leadership of autumn harvest and wheat planting is still very serious in some areas. The leading production organization in Qingcangjiao has not yet been established, which has caused production work to be left to its own devices for a long time. Leading cadres in the tenth district of Dacheng once said to the district cadres: "Let the masses know about large-scale production, no one will be willing to leave the crops in the fields." Li Jie, the district chief of the fifth district, also believes that production work is not as important as other work. During this autumn harvest and wheat planting, the counties only made a rough arrangement, but lacked inspection. Except for the eighth district, which attached great importance to production leadership, other districts in Wuji County generally neglected it. Many cadres believe that production work is a matter for the promotion agency and the industrial科, and the district cadres can do without it. Some think that the masses will produce, and leadership is superfluous. In addition, all localities generally do not pay enough attention to mobilizing women to participate in production.

　　冀中少数干部不从实际出发
    领导生产偏向很多
    强迫组织互助盲目发动挑战
    不顾农忙开会群众非常讨厌
    【冀中电】冀中各地早熟作物收割完毕，目前已进入种麦阶段。各级党政领导机关一般地均重视了生产领导，并已获得不少成绩，但某些地分对领导生产仍有不少缺点和严重偏向。（一）很多地方领导生产中有严重的形式主义和强迫命令作风。在组织劳动互助中，有些地区单纯为“组织起来”而组织，把组织互助与秋收种麦当成两回事。不少干部到村后，不调查旧有互助组织，一下去就要成绩，追求形式，追求数字。青沧交（新划县）六区九个村，两天就组织了五十三个组，其中很多是村干部为应付区干部而假报的。如赵管营只是按农会小组编成了二十一个组，该县很多区干部把秋收种麦看成其次，而单纯去搞互助。县委发现这些偏向后，没有明确提出组织互助主要是解决秋收种麦中人畜力的困难，却笼统地提出“组织起来与种麦并重”。宁晋九区及城关区各村报告组织起来三百零二组，实际上真正互助的只有卅九组。安国大章村把一家的男女分开，男的参加男组，妇女参加女组；使一家劳动力不能统一支配。结果组织了三十七组，实际互助的只有二个组。有些地区不从具体情况出发，订大计划，空喊“保证如何如何”，盲目发动不切实际的“挑战”。有的则在会上自认组织多少互助组。城关区强迫商人参加互助组。该区幸福村原有十一个互助组，后接到得胜村的挑战书后，为应付挑战，要把十一个组破成三四十个组。还有看地方不看具体条件，过份的强迫党员、干部带头。如束鹿十五区区干部，在木店村强迫党员干部每人组织一组。建国十三区区干部命令中王大村党员干部要在旧历八月十七日前全部组织起来，头茬麦子都耩上，二茬都耕过来。十区秘书马永信，在老庄子号召干部、党员带头多种麦，村干部说：“地干不能多种”，马同志却硬叫村干多种，急的村干部说“俺们多种，扔些种籽没什么，群众扔了谁赔呀！”静海十一区区干部董同志，到孙村强迫二十二家船户与群众合伙，船主不同意，第二天董同志见村边有只船，喊叫不来，竟开枪威胁。青沧交某区干部在金庄子开会时，号召：“明天早晨找目标，晌午合伙，晚上小组报告。”还说“有牲口不和无牲口的合伙是尖头”。第二天晚上“组织了九组”，实际上却是旧有的九个组，每组添了两户军属。安国北马妇女干部，在秋收正忙时，强制带动了一百六十二个妇女给军属秋收三天，区干部还说这是“自愿”。青沧交、宁晋等地有些村，在组织互助时，事先由村干部编制好，在群众大会上公布一下就算组织起来，完全违反了自愿原则。（二）各地领导干部，大部运用了以参加生产来领导生产的方法，但仍有不少干部放不下架子。安国、任邱有的区干部到村后，只注意要成绩，要数目字，却很少从生产中去深入了解群众思想顾虑。束鹿十四区干部大部没有帮助群众生产。在南智邱工作的区干部，只在大会上作了号召，向村干部要报告。有的干部认为只开几个会便算完成任务。任河、大城有的妇女干部，竟认为参加生产是耻辱。肃宁二区区干到村去检查工作时，白天睡觉、溜弯，却不愿深入群众去领导生产。建国十区区委秘书在黄屯领导生产时，在一家住了三天，很少出门，还得村干部照顾他。但建国、青沧交、安国有些区干部，则是光帮助群众生产，却了解不了什么生产情况。有的干部，在领导生产中不珍惜群众及村干部的生产时间，如建国六区干部下乡后，不管群众忙闲便开会，沿村群众正在忙于收割时，二十天却一连开了二十个群众会。景和村自今年八月下旬到现在，每天开一次群众大会，群众非常讨厌，到会场也不发言，区干部还埋怨群众“落后”。（三）忽视秋收种麦领导现象，在某些地区仍很严重。青沧交领导生产的机构至今仍未建立，使生产工作长期自流。大城十区领导干部曾向区干部说：“叫群众知道大生产就行，老百姓谁也不肯把庄稼扔在地里”。五区区长李杰也认为生产工作不如其他工作重要。这次秋收种麦中，该县各区均只了草布置了一下，但缺乏检查。无极全县除外、八区对生产领导较重视外，其他各区普遍忽视。不少干部认为生产工作是推进社、实业科的事，区干部可以不做。有的则认为群众会生产，领导是多余。另外各地对发动妇女参加生产，一般都重视不够。
