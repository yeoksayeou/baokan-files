　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th. The Shouguang County Public Security Bureau, Director Li Peizhi of the bureau, Section Chief Wang Dengren of the interrogation section, interrogation officer Wang Hongtao, public security soldiers Liu Jinguang, Liu Yumin, and Zhang Zongxue, who performed meritorious service in capturing Wang Yaowu, received a joint circular of commendation from the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the East China Military Region, and the Shandong Provincial Government. The commendation order called on cadres and soldiers in various regions to learn from their attitude of being earnestly responsible to the people and their high degree of revolutionary vigilance. Because during the Jinan Campaign, many escaped Kuomintang officers and soldiers disguised themselves and fled east along the Jiaoji Railway, the counties along the route implemented focused sentry checks and household registration reviews. In recent days, in the Changyi and Weixian areas alone, more than 350 remnants of bandits and scattered soldiers have been captured. Wang Yaowu, the commander of the Second Appeasement Zone of the Kuomintang and chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, was one of those captured in Shouguang, north of Changyi. Wang Yaowu, a Shandong native, disguised himself as a local merchant seriously ill, lying on a bullock cart. He was detected and captured only through the vigilance and conscientiousness of the sentries and cadres of the Shouguang County Public Security Bureau.

　　查获王耀武有功
   　寿光公安局受嘉奖
    【新华社华东十日电】查获王耀武有功的寿光县公安局、该局局长李培之、审讯股长王登仁、审讯干事王洪涛、公安战士刘金光、刘玉民、张宗学等，受到中共中央华东局、华东军区、山东省政府的联合通令嘉奖。嘉奖令号召各地干部和战士学习他们对人民认真负责的态度和高度的革命警惕性。因为在济南战役中有不少漏网的国民党官兵化装沿胶济路东逃，沿线各县实行了有重点地进行岗哨盘查和清查户口，连日来仅在昌乐、潍县地区即已查获残匪散兵达三百五十余人，国民党的第二绥区司令兼山东省政府主席王耀武便是在昌乐以北寿光境内这样被查获的一个。山东人的王耀武化装成一个害了重病的本地商人睡在大车上，依靠寿光县公安局的哨兵和干部的机警认真才被查觉俘获。
