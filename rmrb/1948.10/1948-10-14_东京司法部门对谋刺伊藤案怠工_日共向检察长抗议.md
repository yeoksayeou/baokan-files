    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: TASS Tokyo reported that Akahata reported that the Japanese Communist Party protested to the Prosecutor General about the Tokyo judicial departments' dragging their feet on the assassination attempt on Ito Ritsu, member of the Central Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party.
