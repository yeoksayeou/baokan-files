　　Frontline Reporter Assesses Three Consecutive Victories in Central Shaanxi
  　Hu Bandit's Defensive Strength Greatly Weakened
  　Not to Mention "Reinforcing" Taiyuan, Even Maintaining the Current Situation in the Northwest is Difficult.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 20th] A frontline reporter commenting on the three consecutive victories of the Northwest People's Liberation Army in the Central Shaanxi campaign, north of Dali, stated: The Northwest People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive has now achieved three victories in three battles. In the early August battle at the foot of the Huanglong Mountains, the enemy's 36th Division, with three brigades, and relying on reinforcements from two reorganized divisions, a total of four brigades, only one to two days away, was still annihilated with over 9,000 casualties; in the September 6th and 7th battle north of Li, the enemy's 17th Division and 38th Division, totaling four brigades, with reinforcements of two reorganized divisions totaling seven brigades only one to two days away, were again annihilated with over 16,000 casualties; in the September 11th to 13th battle in the Luo River triangle area, ten enemy brigades closely packed together were also divided and attacked by our army, with the 65th Division suffering 7,000 casualties. The three battles took only eight days in total, while the enemy suffered a total of over 33,000 killed, wounded, and captured. The 17th Division, praised by Hu Bandit Zongnan as the "nation's staunch troops," and the 38th Division, known as "elite," both suffered devastating blows in this campaign and have lost their fighting capability. The 65th Division, regarded as an ace in the hole by Hu Bandit in the Northwest, also suffered a major blow from the People's Liberation Army. After the People's Liberation Army's spring offensive in the Northwest, Hu Bandit had only five mobile reorganized divisions, namely the 1st, 17th, 36th, 38th, and 65th Divisions, totaling twelve reorganized brigades. By this point, four reorganized divisions have been severely defeated by our army. Hu Bandit's mobile forces now only have the 1st Division's three brigades relatively intact. The division suffered lighter losses in the Luo River triangle area battle. However, the 1st and 167th Brigades were reorganized after being annihilated in northern Shaanxi and southern Shanxi last year, respectively. Only the 78th Brigade of the division is the only unit in Hu's army that has not been struck by the People's Liberation Army. Hu Bandit has now drawn on his garrison forces to replenish his severely damaged mobile forces, which has greatly weakened his defensive strength. The outstanding feature of our army's three victories in the autumn offensive is the speed of the battles and the magnitude of the results. This is the result of our army's summer training and troop rectification using the three-review method. Therefore, in combat, all our commanders and fighters can be resourceful, decisive, and resolute, greatly demonstrating the spirit of initiative, activity, courage, and tenacity, thus being able to give the enemy a series of blows without losing time. After our army's three victories in the autumn campaign, not only has Hu Bandit's fantasy of "reinforcing" Taiyuan and "assisting" the Central Plains become an illusion, but even maintaining the current situation in the Northwest has become more difficult. In order to prop up this declining situation, protect the gateway to Xi'an, and adorn his own face, Hu Bandit is now assembling the forces of eleven reorganized brigades, advancing side by side, following the old path of the annihilated 36th Division, attempting to invade the Huanglong Mountain area once again. The Central News Agency is daily boasting about their imagined "victory" in order to cover up their defeats. But the facts will soon prove that all this will only accelerate Hu Bandit's demise.

　　前线记者评陕中三战三捷
  　胡匪防御力量大为削弱
  　莫说“增援”太原，西北现状也难维持。
    【新华社陕中前线廿日电】前线记者评述西北人民解放军此次陕中作战在大荔以北两次大捷称：西北解放军的秋季攻势作战，至此已三战三捷。八月上旬黄龙山麓战役，敌整三十六师以三个旅之众，并紧靠两个整编师计四个旅的援兵，前后相距只一日至两日路程，仍被我军歼灭九千余名；九月六、七两日荔北战役，敌整十七师及整三十八师计四个旅，其后紧靠二个整编师计七个旅的援兵，也只隔一天至两天路程，又遭我歼灭一万六千余名；九月十一日至十三日洛河三角地带之战，紧靠在一起的十个旅的敌军也被我从中分割切击其整六十五师，被歼七千余名。三次战斗共只费时八天，而敌被毙伤俘者则共达三万三千余名。被胡匪宗南夸为“国家的坚干部队”的整十七师与素称“精锐”的整三十八师，均在此次战役中遭受歼灭性打击，已丧失战斗力。而在西北被胡匪视为王牌的整六十五师也受到了解放军的重大打击。胡匪在西北解放军春季攻势后，其机动部队只有五个整编师，即整一师、整十七师、整三十六师、整三十八师、整六十五师，共合十二个整编旅，至此已有四个整编师遭我军痛歼。胡匪机动部队，现只剩下整一师三个旅比较完整，该师在此次洛河三角地带作战中损失较轻。但其中第一旅、第一六七旅则系于去年先后在陕北、晋南被歼后补整而成，只该师的七十八旅是胡军中目前唯一未遭受解放军打击的部队。胡匪现已抽调其守备部队补充其大受损伤的机动部队，这就大大削弱了他的防御力量。我军秋季攻势三战三捷中的显著特点，就是战斗迅速，战果巨大。这是我军经过夏季练兵、用三评方法进行部队整训的结果。因此在作战中，我全体指战员均能机智灵活，果敢坚决，大大发挥了自动积极和勇猛顽强的作战精神，因而能够不失时机地给予敌人一连串的打击。西北战局，经过我军秋季三次胜利后，胡匪不仅“增援”太原，“援助”中原的幻想已成泡影，即西北现状亦更难维持了。胡匪为撑持这种颓败的局势，保护西安的门户，装璜自己的颜面，现正集结十一个整编旅的兵力，齐头并进，踏着三十六师被歼的老路，企图再一次向黄龙山区进犯，中央社则天天吹嘘他们幻想中的“胜利”以图掩饰败绩。但是事实不久就要证明，这一切只会加速胡匪的灭亡。
