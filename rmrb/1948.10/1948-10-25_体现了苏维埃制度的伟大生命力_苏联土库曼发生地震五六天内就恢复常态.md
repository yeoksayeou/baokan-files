　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st】TASS reports: Ashgabat, the capital of the Soviet Turkmenistan Republic (in western Central Asia, on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea), recently suffered a severe earthquake. With the rapid and massive assistance of the Soviet government and various republics, the main aspects of the lives of the residents there had been restored within five or six days. Babayev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Turkmenistan Republic, stated in a speech that the people of the Turkmenistan Republic, during this disaster, especially experienced the deep friendship of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and the great vitality of the Soviet system.
　　The earthquake in Ashgabat occurred late on the 5th, causing many houses to collapse, as well as deaths and injuries. The Soviet Council of Ministers immediately appointed a government committee on the 6th to rush to the scene to carry out emergency relief work. In the three days following the earthquake, 120 giant civil aviation transport planes transported the injured every day. A total of 6,226 injured people were airlifted to other cities in the Turkmenistan Republic and hospitals in neighboring republics for treatment. Furthermore, more than 1,000 doctors and medical personnel were dispatched from Moscow and other places to establish temporary hospitals and medical stations to carry out rescue work. At the same time, several planes, trains, and hundreds of trucks transported massive amounts of aid day and night from various places, including 10,000 tons of refined compressed food, sufficient penicillin, large quantities of clothing, socks, blankets, various cotton textiles, cooking utensils, and other household appliances, wooden prefabricated houses covering an area of 50,000 square meters, and large amounts of wood, cement, glass, and various building materials. All of these supplies were distributed to the affected residents free of charge to meet their needs.
　　The people of Ashgabat's urban and suburban areas showed exceptional perseverance. Immediately after the earthquake, they began clearing and restoration work. Railway traffic was fully restored to normal two days later. Telecommunications were also fully restored five days later. The power grid is also rapidly being restored, and the main urban areas have been relit. Radio broadcasts have also resumed, and loudspeakers on the streets and broadcasting squares are reporting major domestic and international events to residents as usual. Peaceful and productive life has been restored as before.

    阿斯卡巴德市区和市郊的人民表现了特殊的毅力，地震后，立即开始清除和恢复工作。铁路交通两天后即完全恢复常态。五天后电讯交通也全部恢复。电力网也在迅速恢复中，主要市区已重放光明，无线电亦已重行广播，大街和广播场上的扩音器照常向居民报告国内外大事，和平、劳动的生活照旧恢复了。
