[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Since the North China Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of building North China and increasing production by an inch, the leadership in various regions has been closely monitoring disaster relief and production, carrying out a lot of work, and achieving significant results. According to extremely incomplete statistics, various disasters have occurred in various regions of North China, but they have finally been overcome by the power of the people's united struggle, achieving an average harvest of about 70% across the region. The disaster situation and struggle experience are reported as follows:
　　　　(I) Disaster Situation in Various Regions
Since summer and autumn, various regions across the area have continuously suffered from different degrees of disasters, especially the water and insect disasters in Southern Hebei and Central Hebei. The details are as follows:
    Southern Hebei Water Disaster: According to statistics from the first, second, third, and fourth districts, 4,268,456 mu of cultivated land were flooded, accounting for more than one-eighth of the total cultivated land area of the region, of which 698,000 mu had no harvest, and 1,411 villages were affected. 15,160 houses collapsed, 24 people were drowned, and 7 were injured.
    Insect Disaster: Except for Linqing, all 41 counties were affected, with Jixian, Hengshui, Fudong, Nangong, Guangping, Feixiang, Yuanchao, and Enxian in the fourth and fifth districts being the most serious. In Zaoqiang, Wuyi, and Jixian counties in the fifth district, a total of 1,481 villages were affected, with 1,088 villages affected, accounting for 73.46% of the total number of villages in the three counties. In Zaoqiang County, out of 38,462 mu of millet land, 6,260 mu of millet leaves were eaten, accounting for 16.28%, and the rest were eaten to half-leaves or flower-leaves. In Fudong County, out of 65,000 mu of millet land, 45,000 mu were infested with armyworms, and only 9,000 mu in the first and eighth districts had their millet leaves eaten. In Wuyi County, out of 7,583,800 mu of cultivated land, 146,091 mu were affected by insect pests, accounting for 20% of the total villages, or 95% of the millet land. In Jixian County, 55,076 mu of millet leaves were eaten, and 5,448 mu had half of their leaves eaten. A total of 4,133,950 jin of insects were caught. According to general estimates, those with eaten millet leaves will reduce production by one-half, and those with half of their leaves eaten will reduce production by one-third. The average reduction in production in each county is one-third. Calculating the average yield of 200 jin per mu, Jingxian County reduced production by 33,936,936 jin; Fudong County reduced production by 230,000 jin to 270,000 jin.
    Spring Famine: According to statistics in March, more than 20 counties in four districts, except for the fifth district, suffered from famine, with Yongnian, Daming, and Weixian being the most severe. In the Wantidi area of Daming, more than 30 qing of land were barren. In Weixian County, within 60 li long and 10 li wide along the Zhang River, there were 82 severely affected villages and 85 lightly affected villages. It is estimated that 75% of the people in Duanxiaosi village and 65.9% of the people in Shenqiao village were begging for food. In Yongnian County, 30,000 people were immediately without food. According to statistics from 56 villages in the first district, 112 qing of land were barren, accounting for 9.3% of the cultivated land area. In Sunlianyan in the second district, 51.1% of the people had no food. There were 20 villages where 24.14% of the total village population had no food, 15 villages where 12.9% had no food, and 21 villages where 40.8% had no food. In the usually prosperous fourth and fifth districts, 4,756 people had nothing to eat, 5,760 people would not be able to survive until summer, and there were 2,338 mu of newly barren land.
    Hail Disaster: In mid-June, hail fell in Enxian, Pingyuan, and Julu counties. According to statistics from 51 villages in Julu, 1,512 mu were damaged by hail.
    Central Hebei Water Disaster: In late July, various rivers swelled, and the Hutuo River and the Zhulong River breached their banks. A total of 33 counties in the region were affected by the floods, and 1,915 villages were flooded, accounting for about 13% of the total number of villages in the region. 3,288,916 mu of cultivated land were flooded (missing figures for Shenze, Wenxin, and Xiongwen), accounting for about 12% of the total cultivated land area of 30,001,745 mu in the region. Due to the floods, the grain yield was reduced by about 3.06 million shi, a reduction of about 30.5% compared with the usual average year. About one million people were affected. According to statistics from Renqiu, Xianxian, Wenxin, Gaoyang, and Jinghai counties, the number reached 400,000. The ninth district was the most severely affected, especially Anping, Jinghai, and Xianxian counties. Some of the disaster victims have already begun to flee and beg for food. According to statistics from Dingxian County in the ninth district and Gaocheng County in the eleventh district, a total of 1,361 people had their food supply cut off, which shows the severity of the disaster.
    All 13 counties in the ninth district were flooded, with 986 villages flooded, accounting for 30% of the total number of villages in the district. The total cultivated land in the district was 8,776,191 mu, and the flooded cultivated land was 2,471,877 mu, accounting for 28.16% of the total cultivated land, of which 977,853 mu had no harvest, 514,540 mu had a 70% reduction in yield, 505,112 mu had a 50% reduction in yield, 327,431 mu had a 30% reduction in yield, and 146,941 mu had a 20% reduction in yield. This autumn, only Suning and Boxian counties had 102,598 mu of drained land unsuitable for wheat planting. 9,177 mu of cultivated land were destroyed by floods, and 10,459 mu were covered by sand (statistics from four counties). In addition, 39,385 houses were destroyed (statistics from nine counties), 1,873 wells were destroyed, 22,989,500 jin of grain were damaged (statistics from three counties), 34,172 pieces of furniture were destroyed (statistics from two counties), 145 livestock were drowned in Anping, and a total of 29 people were killed or injured in five counties.
    Insect Disaster: It began to be discovered in mid-August and became widespread in three districts by the end of August, and subsided in early September. According to statistics from 29 counties in the eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts, 3,596 villages were affected by insect pests (armyworms, followed by fire beads and locusts). Millet was the most severely affected crop, with most of the millet leaves eaten, followed by corn, beans, cotton, yams, and fruit trees. The most serious case was in the ninth district of Shulu County, where 70% of the millet was eaten. In Haojia Village, Raoyang County, 6,000 jin of insects were killed in two days. According to statistics from 27 villages in the fourth district of Lixian County, more than 33,000 mu of crops and 152,471 mu of cotton were damaged. In Beise Village, Boye County, more than 1,000 mu of cotton had no harvest. Therefore, the insect disaster also caused an average yield reduction of 11.56% across the region.
    Combining the above water and insect disasters, the average yield reduction across the region was 22.06%, and the affected population was about one million, accounting for nearly one-eighth of the total dependent population in the region.
    Drought Disaster: Since the beginning of summer, there has been a severe drought, resulting in a 40-50% reduction in the autumn harvest in Shulu, Jin County, Jianguo and other counties.
    Hail Disaster: On July 5, hail fell in four districts of Shulu, covering an area of 50 li long and 20 li wide. According to statistics from the fifteenth district, a total of 35,000 mu of crops were destroyed.
    Taihang Water Disaster: The Zhang River breached its banks in Zhangnan, and most of the villages in Zhangnan County were flooded. The Fu and Zhang Rivers flooded the third district of Cixian County, and more than 20 villages in Xinxiang, Huixian, Xingtai, and Yexian were also flooded. Some villages in Wenxian County on the north bank of the Yellow River were also flooded, with Jiaoyu Slope Village being the most severely affected, with 80% of the autumn seedlings flooded. More than 1,000 houses collapsed in Yuanshi City, and 6,000 houses collapsed in Xingtai.
    Insect Disaster: Local areas in 17 counties suffered from locust plagues, especially along the Pinghan Railway. According to statistics from 76 villages in 7 counties, more than 22,000 mu of crops were damaged. The most serious case was in Zhangnan, where one-third of the villages were affected by insect pests.
    Hail Disaster: According to statistics from 8 counties, 32,000 mu of crops were destroyed by hail, with Lucheng being the most severely affected. According to statistics from 14 villages, 7,100 mu of wheat seedlings and 14,600 mu of autumn seedlings were destroyed.
    Spring Famine: This spring, in March, the number of disaster victims reached 600,000, with Yuci and Taigu in Central Shanxi, Anyang, Xinxiang, and Xiuwu in Northern Henan, and Yuanshi in Western Hebei being the most severely affected. In Yuanshi County alone, 25,000 people had no food to eat in March.
    North Yue Water Disaster: Excluding statistics from Huolu in the fourth district, a total of 161,110 mu of cultivated land were destroyed by floods, 28,666 mu were silted up, 20,070 mu of autumn seedlings were drowned, 3,518 mu of sandy cultivated land were washed away, 98,920 houses were destroyed, 27 people were killed and washed away, 62 people were injured, and 287 weaving machines were destroyed. According to estimates from various counties, this year's autumn harvest is about 40% or 60%. According to statistics from Hunyuan, Datong, Yingxian, and Fanshi counties in the first district, a total of more than 130 qing of cultivated land were destroyed by floods, with an average yield of 60%. In the sixth district, more than 150 qing of cultivated land were destroyed by floods, of which 50 qing had no harvest.
    Insect Disaster: According to statistics from Yixian, Mancheng, Dingxing, Wanxian, Tangxian, Wangdu and other counties in the fifth district, more than 170 villages were affected by insect pests. Some villages in Yuxian County in Southern Chahar and Jingxing in the fourth district also experienced insect pests.
    Spring Famine: Due to the poor harvest last year, about 4,000 people in 67 villages in two districts of Pingding in the second district were starving. In 75 villages in the second and third districts of Yuxian County, and 151 villages in nine districts of Jingxing in the fourth district, according to statistics from four districts, 74,701 people had less than 40% of the harvest. About 44,000 people in 145 villages in Quyang County, nearly 100 villages in five districts of Jianping, Huolu, and Xingtang, and 53 villages in Tangxian County in the third district were affected. Due to the wasteland caused by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, there were more than 30,000 mu in Laishui and Wanping areas in the third district, accounting for about 75% of the entire third district. Nearly 38,000 people in Shouyang in the second district were transferred to the inland, and 4 people starved to death. More than 30 people were begging for food in Yangquan.
    Wind and Hail Disaster: A total of 162,366 mu of crops were destroyed. Ten districts in three counties of Yuxian, Xuanhua, and Zhuolu in Southern Chahar were affected. Some villages were particularly severely affected. For example, according to statistics from 9 villages in Caozhuangzi Qiangfeng Cliff in the thirteenth district of Yuxian County, a total of 3,090.84 mu of crops were destroyed, of which the crops in Caozhuangzi were completely destroyed. The crops in general villages were reduced by about 70%. For example, according to statistics from 33 villages south of the Sanggan River in Xuanhua, more than 50,000 mu of crops were damaged. In the east and west Jian villages in one district alone, 2,000 mu were destroyed, accounting for one-half of the total cultivated land area. A total of more than 4,700 mu of crops were destroyed in some villages in Wanping, Laishui, Huailai, and Liangxiang in Western Pingxi. Excluding Yanggao, 150 villages in six districts in Yanbei were affected by disasters. 90% of the crops were destroyed. Other areas, such as Xingtang in the fourth district, had more than 80 villages affected by disasters. According to a report from the Beiyue First Prefectural Committee, the annual harvest in each county is: Guangling 80%, Hunyuan 70%, Datong 60%, Yanggao 65% to 70%, Lingqiu 65%, Fanshi 65% to 70%, Yingxian 60%, and the average for the entire district is 66% to 67%.
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Water Disaster: Wei River was breached by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Wang Sanzhu in three places, flooding the northern part of Huaxian County and Junxian County. 1,750,000 mu of cultivated land were flooded, of which 1,000,000 mu were destroyed by the Yellow River (all cultivated land and river beaches between the Linhe Dike and the Jin Dike).
    Insect Disaster: In Weihe and Neihuang, insect pests caused the seedlings to fail to grow. Because the seedlings were eaten, some were sown three or four times. In the Zaolin District of the Eighth District, octagonal insects grew on the trees, eating one-quarter of the jujube leaves, causing a major disaster. Because jujubes are the main income of the district, insect pests occurred in some villages in a total of 14 counties in the summer and autumn.
    Hail Disaster: The crops in the area of more than 100 li long and 50-60 li wide at the junction of Jining, Jiaxiang, and Nanwang in the seventh district were mostly destroyed by hail.
    Drought Disaster: Since the beginning of summer, there has been a severe drought. The most serious disaster areas are the fourth and eighth districts. Most of the seedlings have died from drought. The most serious counties are Gaoling, Changyuan, Huaxian, and Junxian in the fourth district, as well as Quhe, Weinan, and part of Yanjin, and Weihe, Nanle, Puyang, Qingfeng, Kunwu, and Shanghe in the eighth district. In some villages in the sixth and ninth districts, the yield of millet and sorghum was reduced by one-third due to drought.
    Spring Famine: According to statistics from the fourth and eighth districts, a total of 2,525 villages were affected by disasters. The four districts in Hebei include 1.5 million people, and one-third of them were hungry and had no food this spring. In Lilingping Village, Puyang, 45.4% of the families had no food to cook. The most serious situation was no less than the famine of 1942. The total wasteland in the region, north and south of the Yellow River, is 884,045 mu, mainly in Henan. The main reasons are:
    The enemy's continuous harassment, looting, and massacres, and the past overly left-leaning policies, have created many uninhabited areas, such as Qibin in northern Yanjin, which is more serious. The most serious area in the fifth district is still uninhabited. There are also some in the remaining three districts. This year's autumn harvest is at most 60%, and the worst areas, such as Guancheng, Chaocheng, and part of Yanggu, did not have thorough rain until July 20th in the solar calendar, with only 20% or 30% of the harvest.
    Taiyue Spring Famine: Jiayuan and Jincheng in the first and fourth districts, and Pingyao and Jiexiu in the first district were the most serious. According to statistics from the fifth district of Jiayuan in April, a total of 39 households were begging for food, and 8 households were selling their children. This spring, a total of 58,000 people were starving in Pingyao and Jiexiu. In Mugua Village, Jiexiu, 8 people hanged themselves or starved to death, mainly due to the Yan Xishan and puppet troops looting last year, our overly left-leaning policies, and hail disasters.
    Hail Disaster: Hail fell in some areas of five counties in the first district, including Qinyuan, Tunliu, Changzi, and Anze. According to statistics, about 15,000 mu of autumn seedlings were destroyed by hail. In the second district, the Nanma administrative village in the third district of Yicheng County, and the Shangxia Liaozhai, Beizhuang, and Wuzhai villages in the second district also experienced hail, which greatly damaged the cotton seedlings, but had little impact on other crops. Hail the size of walnuts fell in four villages, including Jiaokou in Qinshui County. Hemp was completely destroyed, corn could only yield 30%, and millet could only yield 40%. Pumpkins and beans were completely destroyed. On July 9, hail fell in Baiyuan Village, Yangcheng County in the fourth district, destroying more than 500 mu of autumn seedlings. In Zhuangtou Village in the fourth district and Dakouling Village in the sixth district, three girls were killed and three people were injured by hail. Hail also fell in other places, such as Sannanpo Shiquan Village in the sixth district, but fortunately it did not damage the crops.
    Water Disaster: In Liucun, Huacun, Liucun, Macun, Renzhai, Xidazhai, and Xinzhuang villages in the third district of Jiyuan County in the fourth district, 3,350 mu of autumn seedlings were flooded due to heavy rain, and it is estimated that only 40% of the harvest could be obtained. 5,670 mu of autumn crops were destroyed by floods in Chengcun, Qinshi, Shuiyun, Yangcun, Hetou, Wangsai, Zhongmatou, and Nancheng villages, and it is estimated that most of them could only yield 20%. The mountain floods destroyed 100 to 200 mu of autumn seedlings in Dahe administrative village in the third district of Yicheng County in the second district. On July 30, a large flood occurred in the third district of Yuanqu County, damaging some crops. On July 12, a heavy rain in the sixth district of Yangcheng County collapsed many earthen dams and ditches (mostly terraced fields).
    Wolf and Pig Disaster: Mountain pigs eat a lot of crops in villages near the mountains in the second and third districts of Yicheng County in the second district. Mountain pigs eat more than 50 mu of crops (yams) in the third district of Qinshui County. Badgers are found in all districts, with the first, second, and third districts being more severe. In addition, wolves severely injure people in counties such as Qinyuan, Qin County, and Anze in the first district, Jiyuan in the fourth district, and Fushan and Qinshui in the second district. For example, 21 people have been eaten in Zuantian Gou in the fourth district of Fushan County since January of this year, and 74 people have been eaten in Longwang Gou in the fifth district. One or two people dare not go to the fields. According to statistics, a total of 424 people have been bitten or killed by wolves in the region. Forty-two sheep were bitten to death in Xishan Village, Yangcheng County, in one night.
    Plague: Dysentery and cholera are prevalent in Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Qin County, and Qinyuan in the first district. Smallpox has also been found in Qin County and Qinyuan. In Zhangxiu Village, Lingshi County alone, 18 people died. In Linjiazhuang, Jiexiu, more than 30 people died in more than 80 households. Dysentery has also been found in Qinshui in the second district and the first and third districts of Gaoping in the fourth district. Most of the patients are children. More than 20 children died in Beicun in the third district in July. Five or six people died in Quanwang Village in the first district. There have also been many child deaths in Jincheng and other places. Doctors have been organized to go to the countryside for treatment, and many have been cured.
    Chicken Plague: Chicken plague is prevalent in Qinshui, Qin County, Qinyuan, Tunliu, Changzi, and Fencheng, and there is no way to treat it. More than 800 chickens died of plague out of more than 1,000 chickens in Wuzhai Village in the first district of Qinshui County. The situation in Yangcheng County is even more serious, and the chickens in some villages have all died.
    Comprehensive Disaster Assessment: The estimated annual harvest in Southern Hebei is 60%, Hebei-Shandong-Henan 60%, Central Hebei 60% to 70%, North Yue and Taiyue 70%, and there are no specific figures for Taihang, but it is estimated to be about 50% to 70%. The average harvest for the entire North China region is 65%.
    　　　　(II) Causes of Disasters
    First, the occurrence of floods is due to years of war, disrepair of river embankments, animal burrows and water holes that have not been filled, and siltation of river channels, resulting in poor water flow. Second, the clearing of land for cultivation and deforestation in mountainous areas has turned forested mountains into bare mountains, which cannot prevent wind and store water, and mountain floods are prone to occur. Third, there was excessive rainfall in July and August this year (300 hao, accounting for more than 50% of the rainfall in North China). Fourth, the enemy destroyed river embankments overtly or covertly. These factors led to this year's major floods.
    Second, the occurrence of insect disasters is due to the heavy burden of long-term war and the overly left-leaning policies in the past land reform, which led to low morale among farmers (which has gradually improved), rough cultivation of land, and even failure to carry out autumn and wheat cultivation. A large number of insect eggs were buried underground and could not be killed by sunlight or freezing. When there was a lot of rain and the ground was wet this year, the insect eggs grew and reproduced. Second, after the discovery of insect eggs and larvae, they were not eradicated in time, allowing them to spread.
    Third, the epidemic is prevalent because people's lives are unstable due to long-term war, and they lack nutrition, weakening their resistance to infectious diseases. Second, rural areas accumulate dirt and sanitation is poor, making it easy for bacteria to grow. Third, many pharmacies were mistakenly attacked during the land reform, so people and animals had no place to get medicine for treatment when they were sick.
    In addition, the bureaucracy of the leadership in some areas and the low morale of some cadres, when disasters were discovered, they did not rush to rescue, but had a paralyzing and waiting mentality, which was also an important reason for expanding and aggravating the disaster. Due to these reasons, this year's disaster situation is particularly widespread and serious.
    　　　　(III) Disaster Relief Achievements and Experiences
    This year, although the disaster situation was severe in many areas, under the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the government, cadres and the masses in various places carried out arduous struggles against the disasters. In flood prevention, the counties established flood prevention headquarters, and the main cadres went to the flood areas to lead the rescue and dike closure. The masses in Pingxiang, Southern Hebei, repaired more than 2,000 zhang of dangerous projects in three days. In Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the autumn seedlings of thousands of hectares were protected on both sides of the Xiaohe River by dredging the river and draining water in advance. In terms of eliminating pests, Taihang, Northern Henan and other places used the experience of eliminating locusts in 1944, and the locust plague was quickly eliminated. In the hail disaster area, in addition to distributing grain and money, the main thing was to organize the masses to replant late autumn crops and call on them to help each other and engage in production for self-salvation. After these struggles, some of the various disasters were eliminated, and some reduced the degree of harm and narrowed the scope of the disaster area. The lives of the vast majority of the disaster victims have been resolved, and most of the cultivated land that was barren and washed away has been reclaimed and replanted with late autumn crops. The experience:
    (A) Prevent disasters before they occur and launch surprise attacks when disasters strike. This is the only way to effectively prevent the expansion of disasters. If you do not prevent disasters before they occur and do not concentrate your efforts to launch surprise attacks to eliminate them when disasters strike, but disperse your forces and act slowly, you will inevitably expand the degree of the disaster. For example, some leading organs in disaster areas did a good job in advance prevention, and after discovering disasters, they were able to promptly relax or stop other work and concentrate their efforts on disaster relief, so the disasters were very light; some did not do enough prevention work in advance, and after discovering the disaster situation, they did not focus on disaster relief as the center of their work, resulting in serious losses, public dissatisfaction, and other work was not done well. For example, the Gaocheng County Party Committee did not go to rescue when the flood came. The ninth district of Renhe was busy distributing floating wealth and ignored the insect disaster. When the water level in Lizhuang, Linqing rose, they began to defend the embankment, and they were temporarily panicked and could not even find an ax to cut down trees. After the breach, they ran away in a panic, causing great losses to the masses.
    (B) Cadres going deep into the disaster areas and working with their own hands is the most effective way to mobilize and organize the masses to engage in disaster relief.
    For example, after the floods occurred in Central Hebei, Director Luo Yuchuan of the Administrative Office personally went to the disaster area to inspect the disaster situation and guide the work; Comrade Guo Fang, secretary of the eleventh district of the district, personally organized机关 cadres and students from the Second Middle School to catch insects in the fields; the director of the Central Hebei Engineering Bureau, the commissioners of Anping, Renqiu, Jianguo, Hejian, and the Ninth Special District, and the main cadres of the county magistrates and county secretaries of the counties along the river worked with the district and village cadres to brave the rain and go to the embankment to organize the masses to rush to close the breach. In early July, the leadership of Raoyang County prepared flood control materials and tested them before the flood, filling 723 water holes and animal burrows, actively preventing the flood, and successfully passing the flood season; the county magistrates and county party committees of Jize and Linzhang in Southern Hebei worked with the district and village cadres to personally go to the embankment to organize the masses to close the breach with all their strength; after the rain stopped, the county secretary and deputy county magistrate of Zhangnan County in Taihang, and the cadres of the sixth and seventh districts immediately went out to close the breach; the director of the Wu Committee and the district chief Li of Xinxiang County discovered that the Dan River had breached its banks and often braved the rain and waded in the water to organize the masses to rush to close the breach, saving more than 20,000 mu of farmland. Due to the exemplary actions of the cadres, the morale of the masses improved and confidence increased, so they were able to quickly complete the rescue and disaster relief work.
    (C) Overcome the ideological obstacles to disaster relief in the masses, and mobilize the masses to unite in rushing to the rescue and disaster relief. First, superstitious thoughts. Some people think that pests are "god insects," "the more you fight, the more there will be," and "the millet is about to ripen, so it doesn't matter if you fight them." The leadership must patiently educate the masses with actual examples of how fighting insects can avoid disasters and how not fighting insects will lead to disasters to break superstitions. Second, village-based views. For example, when the river water rises sharply in some places, the villages on both sides of the river often steal the embankment and divert the water, flooding the opposite bank. For example, Beilonghua Village in Gaoyang only prevents its own village from being flooded and ignores protecting the embankment, resulting in an opening and flooding many villages; a small number of villages north of the Cangshi Road in Gaocheng only care about the safety of a few people and ignore the interests of the majority, breaking the Cangshi Road, resulting in the flooding of 42 villages. This village-based view must be overcome, and the masses must be educated to have a collective concept of taking the overall situation into account, uniting in rushing to the rescue, and uniting in disaster relief. To this end, it is necessary to put forward vivid and powerful slogans in a timely manner, such as "If one family doesn't take it, the neighbors will suffer," "Floods are merciless, and they flow everywhere. If everyone is of one heart, save yourself and save others," "Protecting the embankment is like protecting life, and closing the breach is like fighting a fire," to raise the awareness of the masses. Third, overcome the pessimistic and disappointed mentality of resignation and call on the masses to rise up and fight against disasters.
    (D) Establish a unified leading organization, such as a "Flood Prevention Committee," "Pest Elimination Committee," or "Insect Catching Headquarters," etc., and adapt it to the requirements of the masses, organize the masses and migrant workers, some organized by class, some organized by street, and some take a free combination method. In short, organize them to unify leadership, unify action, and carry out rescue and disaster relief. Experience has proved that those with sound organizations and organizational forms that meet the requirements of the masses will achieve great results. For example, 11,320 men and women in the seventh district of Anyang, Taihang, were mobilized to eliminate locusts. In less than a week, more than 1,500 mu of autumn seedlings were saved. In Shuangliu Village, Anguo, Central Hebei, a small-scale mutual aid group freely assembled and killed insects on more than 400 mu in one day. When the river water rose sharply in Renqiu, more than 50 river defense committees were organized along the river. The migrant workers were organized by class and street, and they repaired more than 100 li of embankments in one day, reducing the damage caused by the floods. Otherwise, it will take a lot of effort and achieve little results.
    (E) Emphasize production for self-salvation, mutual assistance, and oppose the simple view of relief. The fourth district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan lent out 520.5 million yuan and 165 shi of rice. State-owned stores organized disaster victims to transport grain and obtained more than 200 shi of rice. They used labor to provide disaster relief and earned 124 million yuan from leather tanning, so that 300,000 disaster victims could save themselves. The eighth district seized the slack season and dredged old river channels, digging seven ditches with a total length of 122,650 meters, using 265,300 labor days, freeing more than 1,000 hectares of fertile land from disasters; Central Hebei lent out and provided 1.8 million jin of grain for disaster relief, and organized cooperatives, promotion societies, and state-owned stores in various counties to help the masses in disaster areas produce, proposing "different production methods for different regions." Renqiu County organized 31 villages to catch fish, Anping County's promotion society purchased 21 shi of various vegetable seeds and allocated 6,000 jin of cotton for disaster victims to replant and weave, Jinghai organized more than 4,000 disaster victims to dig ground pears in Wenanwa; Taihang's disaster areas carried forward the experience of overcoming the famine in 1942 and 1943, and engaged in sideline businesses. According to statistics from Pingding, Huguan and other counties, a total of more than 24 million yuan and 898 shi of coarse and fine grains were earned in one month; Jingxing in North Yue planned to organize livestock in five districts to engage in transportation, carrying coal, children carrying it on their backs, young adults carrying it on their shoulders, and women pulling carts. The government lent money to restore 10 civilian kilns and newly opened 39. The Zhao Village coal kiln alone solved the livelihood problems of all the disaster victims in seven villages, and introduced disaster victims to work repairing railways, organized women to make military shoes and weave, and could produce 5,000 soles per month. 20,000 spinning wheels and 400 looms are being promoted. In this way, they successfully survived the famine. Tangxian Production Promotion Society organized the masses to dig herbs and earned 44 million yuan; Taiyue vigorously led the masses to hoe more and topdress, and local fertilizer accumulation work achieved great results. Jincheng's fourth district alone has accumulated 967 carts of manure and 3,652 loads, cut 43,000 bundles of Artemisia, purchased 31,200 jin of sesame cakes, and had sheep bedding on 295 mu; other areas, such as Southern Hebei, stipulated methods to reward reclamation, "No burden for two years, and the right to cultivate for three years," eliminating a large amount of wasteland; Southern Chahar eliminated 107,263 mu of wasteland (as of the end of July), accounting for 66% of all wasteland. According to statistics from 32 counties in Central Hebei (before June 15), a total of 146,468.25 mu of wasteland

　　全区人民团结斗争　战胜各种灾害
    【本报特讯】自从中共华北中央局提出建设华北，把生产提高一寸的方针后，各地领导上对救灾生产均掌握的很紧，进行了不少的工作，而且有了显著的成绩，根据极不完全的统计，华北各区均有各种灾害，但终于被人民团结斗争的力量所战胜，而达到全区秋收平均七成左右的成绩。兹将灾害及斗争经验报导如下：
    　　　　（一）各区灾情
    夏秋以来，全区各地均连续遭受程度不同的各种灾害，尤以冀南、冀中之水虫两灾为甚，兹分述如下：
    冀南　水灾：据一、二、三、四，四个分区的统计，淹耕地四百二十六万八千四百五十六亩，占全区耕地面积八分之一强，其中毫无收成者达六十九万八千亩，被灾村达一千四百一十一村。房屋倒塌一万五千百六十间，淹死二十四人，伤七人。
    虫灾：除临清外，四十一县全部发现以四、五两分区之冀县、衡水、阜东、南宫、广平、肥乡、元朝、恩县为最严重。五分区枣强、武邑、冀县三县共有一四八一村，受灾村计一○八八村，占三县总村数百分之七十三·四六，枣强全县共有谷地三八四六二亩，吃光谷叶六二六○亩占百分之一六·二八，余皆吃成半叶、花叶；阜东全县共谷地六五○○○亩，生黏虫者四五○○○亩，吃光谷叶者仅一、八区即有九千亩；武邑全县耕地七五八三八○亩，虫灾地一四六○九一亩，占全村百分之二十，按谷地占百分之九十五；冀县吃光谷叶五五○七六亩，吃掉一半叶者五四四八亩，共捉虫四一三三九五斤。据一般估计，吃光谷叶者减收二分之一，吃掉一半叶者减收三分之一。各县平均减收三分之一，每亩平均产量二百斤计算，景县减收三三九三六九三六斤；阜东减收二十三万斤到二十七万斤。
    春荒：三月的统计，除五分区外，四个分区二十余县遭荒，永年、大名、魏县最重，大名之万堤一带荒地三十多顷，魏县沿漳河长六十里宽十里内计重灾村八十二个，轻灾村八十五个，段小寺讨饭的估全村百分之七十五，申桥百分之六十五·九。永年全县三万人曾马上没饭吃，一区五十六村的统计荒地一百一十二顷，占耕地面积百分之九·三，二区孙连岩没饭吃的占百分之五十一·一，没饭吃的占全村人口百分之二四·一四者计二十村，占百分之一二·九者十五村，占百分之四○·八者二十一村，素称富庶的四、五区计四千七百五十六口人没吃的，吃不到夏天者五千七百六十口，新荒地二千三百三十八亩。
    雹灾：六月中旬在恩县、平原、钜鹿降雹，钜鹿五十一村统计一千五百一十二亩被砸成灾。
    冀中　水灾：七月下旬，各河暴涨，滹沱河、潴龙河决口，遭水灾者全区达三十三县，被淹村庄一九一五，占全区总村数百分之十三左右；被淹耕地三二八八九一六亩（缺深泽、文新、雄文数字），约占全区总耕地面积三○○○一七四五亩的百分之十二左右，因水灾而减收谷约三○六万石，按通常平均年景减收百分之三○·五；受灾人民约计百万左右。任邱、献县、文新、高阳、静海五县统计即达四十万人。灾情最重者为九分区，其中尤以安平、静海和献县为更严重，灾民有的已开始逃荒乞食。据九分区定县、十一分区藁城二个县统计，曾断口粮者共有一三六一人，灾情之严重，可见一斑。
    九分区十三个县均上水，被淹村庄九八六个，占全分区村数百分之卅左右，全分区耕地八七七六一九一亩，被淹耕地二四七一八七七亩，占总耕地百分之二十八·一六，其中毫无收成者九七七八五三亩，减收百分之七十的共五一四五四○亩，减收百分之五十的共五○五一一二亩，减收百分之三十的共三二七四三一亩，减收百分之二十的共一四六九四一亩。今秋不收脱水种麦仅肃宁、博县两县即有一○二五九八亩，耕地被水冲毁者九一七七亩，沙压地一○四五九亩（四个县统计）。另外冲毁房屋三九三八五间（九个县统计），毁井一八七三眼，损坏粮食二二九八九五○斤（三个县统计），毁家具三四一七二件（二个县统计），安平淹死牲口一四五头，五个县共死伤二十九人。
    虫灾：八月中旬开始发现，到下旬即普遍三个分区，九月初才下去，据八、九、十一分区二十九个县统计受虫灾（粘虫，次为火珠子、蝗虫）村达三五九六村，受灾农作物以谷为最重，谷叶大部被吃光，次为玉茭、豆类、棉、山药、果木等。最严重者，如束鹿九区，谷子十分之七被吃，饶阳郝家庄一村两天内打虫六千斤，蠡县四区二十七村统计，咬坏庄稼三万三千多亩，棉花十五万二千四百七十一亩，博野北色村一千多亩棉花已无收成。因此虫灾也使全区平均年景减收百分之十一·五六。
    综合上述水、虫灾，使全区平均年景减收百分之二二·○六，受灾人口约占百万人左右，占全区负担人口约近八分之一。
    旱灾：入夏亢旱，致束鹿、晋县、建国等县秋收减收四、五成。
    雹灾：七月五日束鹿四个区长达五十里，宽二十里之地区普降冰雹，据十五区统计，共毁庄稼三万五千亩。
    太行　水灾：漳河在漳南决口，漳南全县大部村庄被淹，滏、漳两河淹磁县三区，新乡、辉县、邢台、邺县亦有廿余村被淹。黄河北岸的温县部份村庄亦被淹，重者加淤坡村，秋苗地被淹百分之八十，元氏城内塌房千余间，邢台塌房六千间。
    虫灾：十七个县局部地区遭蝗灾，以平汉线为甚，据七个县七十六个村统计，损庄稼二万二千余亩，最严重者如漳南遭虫灾村占三分之一。
    雹灾：据八个县计打毁庄稼三万二千亩，以潞城最重，十四村统计毁麦苗七千一百亩，毁秋苗一万四千六百亩。
    春荒：今春三月间灾民曾达六十万，以晋中之榆次、太谷，豫北之安阳、新乡、修武，冀西之元氏等县较重，仅元氏一县三月间曾有二万五千人没饭吃。
    北岳　水灾：四分区除获鹿无统计外，共计耕地被冲毁者十六万一千一百一十亩，被沙淤者二万八千六百六十六亩，秋苗被涝死者二万零七十亩，沙滩耕地被冲走者三千五百一十八亩，毁房屋九万八千九百二十间，砸死与冲走的人共二十七人，伤六十二名，砸坏织布机二百八十七架。今年秋收据各县估计，约四成或六成。据统计一分区之浑源、大同、应县、繁峙四县，共冲毁耕地一百卅多顷，平均有六成年景。六分区耕地被冲毁者共一百五十多顷，其中毫无收成者共五十顷。
    虫灾：据统计五分区易县、满城、定兴、完县、唐县、望都等县，遭虫灾者共一百七十多村，察南之蔚县、四分区之井陉部份村庄，亦发现虫灾。
    春荒：因去年歉收，二分区之平定两个区六十七村饥民约四千人，盂县二三两区七十五个村，四分区之井陉九个区一百五十一村，据四个区统计不及四成年景的包括七万四千七百零一人，曲阳一百四十五村，约四万四千多人，建屏、获鹿、行唐五个区近百个村，三分区之唐县五十三村。由于蒋匪造成的荒地，在三分区涞水、宛平一带有三万多亩，这种荒地占全三分区的百分之七十五左右，二分区寿阳向内地转移的近三万八千人，饿死四人，在阳泉讨饭吃的达三十余人。
    风雹灾：共计毁庄稼十六万二千三百六十六亩。察南蔚县、宣化、涿鹿三个县十个区遭灾，有些村庄特别严重，如蔚县之十三区曹庄子枪风崖九个村统计，共毁庄稼三○九○·八四亩，其中灾情严重的曹庄子庄稼完全被毁，一般村子农作物约减收十分之七，如宣化桑乾河以南三十三个村的统计损坏庄稼五万余亩，仅一区东西涧两个村即被毁二千亩，占总耕地的面积二分之一，平西之宛平、涞水、怀来、良乡部份村共毁四千七百多亩庄稼。雁北除阳高外，六个区统计受灾村共一百五十村，农作物被砸毁十分之九。其他如四分区行唐即有八十多村受灾。据北岳一地委报告各县年景：广灵八成，浑源七成，大同六成，阳高六成五到七成，灵邱六成五，繁峙六成五到七成，应县六成，全分区平均六点六到六点七成年景。
    冀鲁豫　水灾：卫河被蒋匪王三祝扒堤决口三处，淹及滑县北部及浚县。耕地被淹者一七五○○○○亩，其中黄灾毁田占一○○○○○○亩（全系临黄堤与金堤之间的耕地与河滩地）。
    虫灾：卫河、内黄因虫灾致小苗不长，因苗被吃，而竟有连种三四次者，八分区枣林区树上生八角虫，吃枣叶四分之一，酿成大灾。因枣是该区主要收入，夏秋之交，共计十四县部份村庄发生虫灾。
    雹灾：七分区之济宁、嘉祥、南旺交界处长达百余里，宽五、六十里内之庄稼大部被砸毁。
    旱灾：入夏亢旱，灾情严重者为四、八分区，小苗曾大部旱死，其中尤以四分区之高陵、长垣、滑县、浚县等县全部与曲河、卫南、延津一部，以及八分区卫河、南乐、濮阳、清丰、昆吾、尚和等县为最严重，六、九分区一部村庄，因旱谷子高粱减收三分之一。
    春荒：四、八分区统计，受灾区共二千五百二十五村，河北四个分区合计包括一百五十万人口，今春饥饿无食者占三分之一，濮阳李凌平村断灶者占全村百分之四五·四，最严重者不亚于一九四二年之灾荒。全区荒地，黄河南北共有八八四○四五亩，主要是河南荒地最多。其主要原因是：
    敌人不断骚扰抢掠、屠杀，与过去我之政策过左，造成许多无人区，如鄄北齐宾一部较严重，五分区最严重现在还没人，其余三分区亦有一些。今年秋收，全区最高六成年景，最坏者如观城、朝城、阳固一部旱至阳历七月二十日才落透雨，只有二成或三成年景。
    太岳　春荒：一、四分区之济源、晋城，一分区之平遥、介休为最严重，据济源五区四月份统计，讨饭吃者共三十九户，卖孩子者八户，平遥、介休今春共饥民五万八千人，介休木瓜村因饥上吊及饿死者八人，主要是因为去年遭阎伪抢掠与我之政策过左，以及雹灾所造成。
    雹灾：一分区之沁源、屯留、长子、安泽等五县，部份地区降雹，据统计打毁秋苗约一万五千来亩，二分区翼城三区南马行政村，二区上下辽寨、北庄、五寨等村，亦都降雹，棉苗受损很大，其他庄稼无甚影响。沁水交口等四个村降雹有核桃大，大麻全打毁，玉茭被打的仅有三成收，谷子只能收四成，南瓜、豆角全打毁。四分区阳城柏鸳村，七月九日下雹子，打坏秋苗五百多亩，四区庄头、六区大口领等村，被雹打死三个女孩，打伤三人。其他地方也下过，如六区三南坡枢泉等村，幸未伤庄稼。
    水灾：四分区济源三区刘村，化村、六村、马村、任寨、西大寨、河头村、辛庄等几个村，因大雨冲淹秋苗三千三百五十亩，估计仅有四成收，程村、沁市、水运、阳村、河头、王赛、中马头、南程等十村，冲毁秋庄稼五千六百七十亩，估计大部仅能收二成。二分区翼城三区大河行政村，山洪冲毁秋苗一百亩到二百亩。垣曲三区于七月三十日漂河发大水，淹坏庄稼一部，阳城六区七月十二日大雨冲塌地堰与沟沿地（多梯田）很多。
    狼猪灾：二分区翼城二、三区靠山村庄，山猪吃庄稼很多。沁水三区山猪吃庄稼（山药旦）五十多亩。獾子各区都有，一、二、三区较厉害。又一分区之沁源、沁县、安泽，四分区济源，二分区浮山、沁水等县，狼伤人很厉害，如浮山四区钻天沟今年一月至今被吃二十一人，五区龙王沟被吃七十四人，一、二人不敢上地。据统计全区先后被狼咬伤咬死者共四百二十四人。阳城西山村一夜被咬死羊四十二只。
    瘟疫：一分区平遥、介休、灵石、沁县、沁源普遍发生痢疾、霍乱。沁县沁源并发现天花，灵石张秀一村，就死了十八人，介休林家庄八十余户，就死了三十多人，二分区沁水及四分区高平一、三区也发现痢疾，患者多系小孩。三区北村七月份死小孩二十多个。一区全王村死了五六个。其他如晋城有些死小孩也很多，已组织医生下乡医治，治好者亦不少。
    鸡瘟：沁水、沁县、沁源、屯留、长子，汾城均普遍发生鸡瘟，无法治疗。沁水一区五寨村共千余只鸡，就瘟死了八百多只，阳城更严重，有些村鸡死完了。
    综合各区受灾程度，今年秋收年景，冀南六城，冀鲁豫六成，冀中六成至七成，北岳、太岳各七成，太行无具体数字作依据，估计约在五成至七成。全华北区平均六成半年景。
    　　　　（二）遭灾原因
    第一、水灾之发生，一因连年战争，河堤失修，兽穴水眼，多处未补，河道淤塞水流不畅。二因山地开荒伐林，林山变成童山，不能防风蓄水，山水易发。三因今年七八月间天雨过大过多（三百耗，占华北雨量百分之五十以上）。四因敌人或明或暗破坏河堤，有此数因遂酿成今年大水灾。
    第二、虫灾之发生，一因长期战争负担过重，与过去土改中政策过左，致农民生产情绪低落（现已逐步好转），土地耕种粗糙，甚或不进行秋耕麦耕，大批虫卵埋藏地下，未能晒死冻死，遇到今年雨多地湿，虫卵便生长繁殖起来；二因发现虫卵幼虫后，未能即时扑灭，使其得以蔓延起来。
    第三、瘟疫流行，一因长期战争，人民生活动荡不安，营养不足抵抗力减弱，易于传染病疫；二因农村污物堆积，卫生工作太差，病菌易生；三因土改中误斗了不少药铺，致人畜有病，均无抓药治疗之处。
    另外某些地区的领导上官僚主义与某些干部情绪不高，发现灾害，不去急救，而存在着麻痹等待的侥幸心理，这也是扩大与加重灾害的一个重要原因。由于这些原因，故今年灾情特别普遍而严重。
    　　　　（三）救灾成绩与经验
    今年不少地区灾情虽重，但在党的领导与政府努力下各地干部与广大群众，与灾害进行了艰苦的斗争。在防汛中，各县成立防汛指挥部，各主要干部亲赴汛区领导抢险堵口，冀南平乡群众，三天即修好二千多丈长险工。冀鲁豫各地，事先疏河排水，硝河两岸保住千顷秋苗。在扑灭害虫方面，太行豫北等地发挥了一九四四年剿蝗经验，蝗灾迅速扑灭。在雹灾区除发放粮款外，主要是组织群众补种晚秋作物，号召互济互助生产自救。经过这些斗争之后，各种灾害，有的被消灭，有的减轻了为害的程度与缩小了灾区范围。广大灾民生活绝大部份得到解决，被荒被冲之耕地大部加以开垦与补种晚秋。其经验：
    （甲）灾前预防，灾来突击，这样才能有效的防止灾害的扩大。如灾前不预防，灾来不集中力量突击消灭，而将力量分散，行动迟缓，势必扩大灾害程度。如各灾区领导机关有的因事先防御工作做的好，发现灾害之后，又能及时放松或停止其他工作，集中力量救灾，其灾害则很轻；有的事先防御工作不足，发现灾情之后，又未以救灾为工作重心，结果损失严重，群众不满，而其他工作也未作好。如藁城县委，大水已来，还不去抢救。任河九区忙于分浮财，对虫灾置之不理。临清里庄水势涨大，始上堤防守，临时仓惶，连伐树斧子也找不到，决口后纷纷乱跑，致群众受很大损失。
    （乙）干部深入灾区，亲自动手，是动员与组织群众救灾的最有效的办法。
    如冀中发生水灾后，行署主任罗玉川同志亲到灾区，检查灾情，指导工作；该区十一分区地书郭芳同志亲自组织机关干部与二中学生到地里捕虫；冀中工务局长、安平、任邱、建国、河间、九专区专员和沿河各县县长、县书、县委等主要干部协同当地区村干部冒雨上堤组织群众抢堵。饶阳县于七月初领导上即准备好防汛器材，并于发水前签试，堵填水眼、兽穴七二三个，主动预防，得以安全渡过汛期；冀南鸡泽、临漳等县长、县委协同区村干部，亲自上堤组织群众，全力堵口；太行漳南县书、副县长及六、七区全区干部，大雨停止后，立即出动堵口；新乡县武委会主任和李区长，发现丹河决口，常夜冒雨涉水，组织群众抢堵，使二万多亩田禾得救。由于干部的模范行动，使群众情绪好转，信心增高，故能迅速完成抢险救灾工作。
    （丙）克服群众思想中的救灾障碍，发动群众团结抢险与救灾。第一、迷信思想，有些群众认为害虫是“神虫”、“越打越多”、“谷子快熟，不打也行”；认为“水来有神，挡也白费”。领导上要用打虫就能免灾与不打受灾的实际例子来耐心教育群众打破迷信。第二、村本位观点，如有些地方河水暴涨时，沿河两岸村庄，常常偷堤引水，流淹对岸，如高阳北龙化村只防止本村不受冲，而忽视护堤，结果开了口子，淹了好多村；藁城沧石路北少数村只顾少数人安全，不顾多数人利益，破开沧石路，结果淹了四十二个村。这种村本位观点，必须克服，要教育群众要有顾全大局的集体观念，团结抢险，团结救灾。为此必须及时提出生动有力的口号，如“一家不拿，四邻吃亏”，“水灾无情，到处乱流，大家一心，救己救人”，“挡堤如挡命，堵口如救火”，以此提高群众觉悟。第三、克服悲观失望与听天由命的思想，号召群众起来与灾害作斗争。
    （丁）建立统一领导机构，如“防汛委员会”，“灭虫委员会”，或“捕虫指挥部”等，并适合群众要求，将群众与民工编制起来，有的按班编，有的按街编，也有的采取自由结合办法，总之要组织起来统一领导，统一行动，进行抢险与救灾。经验证明，凡组织健全，组织形式适合群众要求的，其获得成绩就大。如太行安阳七区动员一万一千三百二十个男女剿蝗，不到一星期，救活秋苗一千五百多亩。冀中安国双流村自由集组，小型互助，一天即打了四百余亩的虫子。任邱河水暴涨时，沿河即组织了五十多个防河委员会，民工们按班街编制，一天中即修堤百余里，减少了水患。反之就费力大而收效小。
    （戊）强调生产自救，互助互济，反对单纯救济观点。冀鲁豫四分区贷出五万万二千零五十万元，米一百六十五石，公营商店组织灾民运粮得米二百多石，以工贷赈，并吸收皮硝获利一亿二千四百万元，从此三十万灾民得以自救。八分区抓紧农闲，疏通旧河道，开挖七条水沟，全长十二万二千六百五十公尺，用工二十六万五千三百多工，使千余顷良田免灾；冀中贷粮赈粮一百八十万斤，并组织各县合作社、推进社、公营商店，到灾区扶助群众生产，提出“不同地区组织不同生产门路”，任邱县组织三十一村捕鱼，安平县推进社购买各种菜籽二十一石，拨棉花六千斤供灾民补种和纺织，静海组织四千余灾民到文安洼挖地梨；太行各灾区发扬一九四二、四三年渡荒经验，进行搞副业，据平定、壶关等县统计，一月中共赚钱二千四百余万元，粗细粮共八九八石；北岳井陉有计划组织五个区牲口搞运输，扛煤，儿童背，青壮年担，妇女拉小车。政府贷款恢复十座民窑，新开办三十九座，仅赵庄一个煤窑即解决七个村全部灾民生活问题，并介绍灾民做工修铁路，组织妇女做军鞋、纺织，每月可纳出底子五千双，二万辆纺车，四百架织布机正在推进。这样就顺利的渡过了灾荒。唐县生产推进社组织群众刨药得利四千四百万元；太岳大力领导群众多锄上追肥，各地积肥工作获得很大成绩，仅晋城四区已积粪九六七车，另三六五二担，割蒿四三○○○多捆，购麻饼三一二○○斤，羊卧地二九五亩；其他如冀南规定办法，奖励开荒，“二年不负担，三年耕种权。”消灭了大量荒地；察南消灭荒地十万零七千二百六十三亩（截至七月底），占全部荒地百分之六十六。冀中三十二县统计（六月十五前）共消灭荒地一四六四六八·二五亩，占全部荒地百分之五十一点五。凡坚持生产自救者，均能克服困难；凡单纯依靠救济者，各种困难便无法解决。如寿阳虽曾救济二次，贷粮八百石，但因组织生产不足，故仍有二万多人转移内地，生活无法解决，有二十多个灾民在阳泉市乞食，并饿死了四人。这例子充分说明单纯救济观点，不组织灾民生产自救，就不能达到救灾目的的道理。
