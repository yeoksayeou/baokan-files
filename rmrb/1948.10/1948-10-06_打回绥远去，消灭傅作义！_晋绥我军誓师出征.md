Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 5th: "Fight back to Suiyuan and eliminate Fu Zuoyi!" This is the magnificent slogan put forward by the Jin-Sui People's Liberation Army during this advance into Suiyuan. Before the advance, the People's Liberation Army underwent a new-style military consolidation and a speaking bitterness campaign, which raised awareness and boosted morale. Soldiers eagerly petitioned to go to war against Fu Zuoyi's bandit troops. For example, one unit said in their request to go to war: "We are not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, and we will not rest until Fu Zuoyi is eliminated. We guarantee to resolutely implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and abide by battlefield discipline and urban policies." Another unit said in their request: "We are the sons and brothers of the Sui-Meng people, and we are determined to fight for the liberation of the Sui-Meng people. Everyone unanimously demands to go to war against Fu Zuoyi and liberate Suiyuan." Ren Baohe, a squad leader from a certain unit, whose home is in the Kuomintang-controlled area, his father was beaten to death by reactionary landlords. In his grief-stricken oath, he said: "Dead father! Now is the time for me to avenge you and the countless innocent people who died unjustly. If I don't eliminate Fu Zuoyi, I will have no face to go home and sweep your grave." A wave of emulation for killing enemies and seizing weapons has been set off among new and old soldiers and liberated soldiers in various units.

　　“打回绥远去，消灭傅作义！”
    晋绥我军誓师出征
    【新华社晋绥五日电】“打回绥远去，消灭傅作义!”这是晋绥人民解放军于此次进军绥远时提出的雄壮口号。解放军于进军之前，普遍经过新式整军与诉苦运动，觉悟提高，战志昂扬，纷纷上书请求讨伐傅作义匪军。如某部在请求出征书上说：“我们不怕流血牺牲，不消灭傅匪誓不休。我们保证坚决执行三大纪律八项注意，遵守战场纪律和城市政策。”另部在请求书上则说：“我们是绥蒙人民的子弟兵，坚决为解放绥蒙人民而战，大家一致要求出征讨伐傅匪，解放绥远。”某部班长任保和，家在国民党统治区，他父亲被反动地主打死。他在悲愤的宣誓中说：“死去的爸爸啊！现在是我要替你和无数冤死的人民报仇的时候了。不消灭傅作义，我就没面目回家打扫你的坟墓。”各部新、老战士与解放战士之间都掀起了杀敌、缴枪竞赛的热潮。
