Beiyue Telegram: Hengling Village, District One, Huailai, democratically discussed the agricultural tax burden, and the masses all said it was fair and reasonable. On August 6th, with the help and guidance of the work team, the village held a mass meeting to discuss how to collect the agricultural tax. Based on the spirit of developing production and balancing the burden, the masses, after repeated studies, determined that the village should be divided into four grades, and emphasized the quality of the soil and the reward of diligent labor in the evaluation. For example, the Wang Wanzhong family of two people, his land was said to be of the third grade according to the soil quality, but because he worked diligently from morning till night, the crops grew even better than the first grade, and the evaluation result was still classified as the third grade. Another example is the Wang Wanying family of four, who cultivated the best land, but because he did not work hard, the crops did not grow as well as the third grade. In order to stimulate his production, his land was still assessed as first grade. After four days, the village first had the masses report themselves, then the thirteen evaluation committee members elected for the purpose evaluated, and finally the mass meeting passed it. The village has successfully completed the work of revising the agricultural tax and evaluating the output of each household. Because the burden is fair and reasonable, the production enthusiasm of the masses has generally increased. Wang Qiyu started picking up manure the day after the conference. Wang Wanxi planted one thousand and sixty-five jujube trees in two days.

　　奖励辛勤劳动  精确评定质量
    横岭民主评议负担
    【北岳电】怀来一区横岭村民主讨论农业税负担，群众都说公平合理。八月六日，在工作组的帮助指导下，该村召开全村群众大会，讨论农业税怎样征收。群众根据发展生产平衡负担的精神，经过反复研究，把全村确定为四等地，在评议中特别强调地质好坏与奖励辛勤劳动这两个问题。如王万忠家两口人，他的地拿地质说是三等地，可是由于他起早睡晚辛勤劳动，庄稼长得比一等地还好，评议结果仍然划成三等地。又如王万英四口人，种的是头等好地，由于他不好好劳动，庄稼长的还不如三等地，为了刺激他生产，仍然评定他的地为一等。经过四天时间，该村先由群众自报，再经选出的十三个评议委员的评议，最后由群众大会通过。全村关于修正农业税，评议各户产量的工作已胜利完成。由于负担公平合理，群众生产情绪普遍提高。王起雨在大会后第二天就开始拾粪。王万喜在两天内栽枣树一千零六十五棵。
