(Taihang News) Zhaocun Elementary School in the Fifth District of Changzhi was very chaotic in the past. Teachers didn’t teach, students couldn’t read, and they were constantly performing the Yangge dance, which the masses strongly opposed. As ironworker Jing Quan said, "It doesn't matter if there is a school like that or not."

This spring, teacher Zhao Xuefu was transferred to the village, and the masses were very cold towards him. At first, he didn't have a stove to cook on, and the village didn't provide him with meals. The cadres claimed it wasn't their responsibility, and the teacher went without food for two meals. But he knew that this was the bad result of the school not being run well in the past, and he couldn't resent the masses. He was determined to achieve something and change the masses' impression of the school. He immediately divided the forty-plus students who enrolled into classes according to their level and held classes on time, strengthening their cultural studies. After a month, the number of students increased from more than forty to eighty-seven. Seeing the school's development, the teacher worked even harder, never missing a class. When he was sick, he had the older children teach in his place, and as soon as his illness was slightly better, he resumed teaching as usual, not sleeping during the afternoon and not going to bed early at night. After three months of this, the students made great progress. For example, Feng Mangze in the first grade used to only read aloud without understanding, and couldn't actually recognize the characters. Now, he can not only write and speak, but also knows the stroke order of the characters. Zhang Shulin in the second grade used to only memorize, but now he can recognize and write characters. He can also write general letters and notes for the families of soldiers.

After these three months of effort, the parents' impression of the school changed. For example, Xiu De's mother saw that her child could write and calculate, and happily said, "Study hard! I'll sew you a new quilt." Bao Shun's mother, who was over forty years old, saw that her son had learned so many skills, and mobilized others to send their children to school. Feng Shuiwang and his younger brother Xiao Wang also enrolled after her encouragement. Zhao Laoyuan from the east street sent his son, and Feng Yujin sent his younger sister to school, and the number of students increased day by day. Some students even continued to study characters at home. When asked why they were so diligent, they said, "The school has several classes a day, and if we don't study, we won't be able to keep up with others!"

The village cadres also changed their past distasteful attitude and cared about the school in every way. The deputy village chief saw that the rice allocated to the teacher was coarse and exchanged his good rice for the teacher's; the villagers' education committee member saw that the school lacked teapots, pots, and bowls, and went to Yincheng to buy replacements; the finance and grain committee member saw that the night students had no mats to sleep on, and bought five large mats for them. The village cadres all said, "There are still eighty or ninety students during the busy farming season, and there will definitely be more in the winter." In addition to repairing fifteen benches, they are also preparing timber, bricks, and tiles to repair the school equipment and school buildings after the autumn harvest. The students' parents are even happier, and have repeatedly said, "Studying for three months like this is more than they learned in the past three years!" "This is what learning real skills is all about!"

### “这才学的是真本事！”　长治赵村小学转变得好

　　“这才学的是真本事！”
  　长治赵村小学转变得好
    【太行讯】长治五区赵村小学过去很混乱，教员不上课，学生不识字，整天扭秧歌跳舞，群众非常反对。如打铁工人井泉说：“象这样学校有没有都行。”
    今春又调教员赵学富到村，群众对他很冷淡，开始没修下锅灶，村里也不给派饭，干部推说不是自己的责任，教员两顿没吃到饭。但他知道这是过去学校没办好留下的恶果，不能怨恨群众，自己下定决心要干出点成绩来，改变群众对学校的印象。当即将入校的四十多个学生按程度分开班，按时上课，加强文化学习。一月以后学生由四十余名增至八十七名。教员看到学校有发展，更加努力，一天课也不缺，自己有了病，让大些的儿童代上，第二天病稍轻即照常上课，午不睡觉，夜不早寝，这样过了三个月，学生大有进步。如一年级冯忙则，过去只会仰头空念，实际认不下字，现在不仅会写会讲，还知道字的先后笔划。二年级张树林过去也光会背诵，现在会认会写。还会给抗属写一般信和条子。
    经过这三个月的努力，转变了家长对学校的印象。如修德妈妈看到自己孩子又会写又会算，高兴的说：“你好好学吧！给你缝个新被子。”四十多岁的保顺妈妈，看到自己的儿子学会这么多本事，就动员别人送孩子上学，冯水旺、小旺弟兄俩，经他动员也入了学。东街赵老元送他儿子，冯玉金送他妹妹都来上学，学生一天天多了。有些学生回家还继续学字，问他为啥这样用功？他们说：“学校一天上好几课，不学就跟不上别人啦！”
    村干部也改变过去的讨厌态度，处处关心学校，副村长见教员拨来的米粗糙，把自己的好米换给教员；村民教委员看到学校缺少茶壶、锅碗，就到荫城买回补充；财粮委员见夜读生没铺的，就给买了五条大席。村干们都说：“农忙还有八九十个学生，冬天一定更多了。”他们除修补了十五条凳子外，又准备下木料砖瓦，等秋后修理校具校舍。学生家长们更是高兴，纷纷反映：“照这样念三个月比过去三年学的还多哩！”“这才学的是真本事！”
