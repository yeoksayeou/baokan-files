What is a Proportional Tax?
The Difference Between Proportional Tax and Progressive Tax
Editor:
I still have some questions about the reply on August 14 regarding "Whether agricultural tax should be progressive after land reform." I am raising them again for discussion:
Most areas have now completed land reform, and land has been largely equally distributed. What is the role of progressive or proportional taxation? Who is proportioning whom? Our experimental results show that households with fewer people and slightly more land are at a disadvantage, i.e., widowers and the lonely elderly. Therefore, I do not quite agree with proportional taxation. Is it possible to levy taxes based on mu and output? We are unclear about these principles and hope you can explain them in detail in the newspaper.

Answer: The new agricultural tax regulations stipulate the abolition of progression and the proportional levy on households based on the normal annual output of land, after deducting tax-free points and livestock consumption. This is precisely to adapt to the new rural economic situation after land reform, develop production, ensure supply, and make farmers' burdens reasonable. This is largely the same as your suggestion to levy taxes based on mu and output. You do not quite agree with proportional taxation, but since you have not provided specific materials on the methods of the field experiment in the village, it is difficult to provide a specific response. Based on the letter, we estimate that there may be several situations:
    (1) It is possible that the experiment is being conducted based on the former "proportional plus points" method of the Taihang District, but "proportional plus points" is not a proportional tax, but a form of progressive tax.
    (2) The letter states: "Experimental results show that proportional taxation disadvantages households with fewer people and slightly more land." This is the effect of deducting tax-free points, not a problem of proportional tax (on the contrary, progressive tax does have the problem of burdening households with fewer people and more land). In this regard, the new tax regulations use the method of increasing the tax-free points for the poor, those without labor, families of military personnel and martyrs, and widowers and the lonely elderly to reduce the negative effect of deducting tax-free points in this aspect. Retaining appropriate tax-free points is for the purpose of adjusting and balancing the burden between rich and poor regions. If you have objections to retaining tax-free points, you can also raise them for discussion.
    (3) The letter states: "After land is equally distributed, what is the role of progressive or proportional taxation? It is worth studying who is proportioning whom." This may be due to a lack of clarity about the difference between proportional tax and progressive tax, resulting in errors in the experimental calculation methods. We would like to explain what a proportional tax is and the calculation method of the new agricultural tax for your reference.

The main difference between proportional tax and progressive tax lies in the change in tax rates. A proportional tax stipulates a tax standard, and the same tax rate is levied regardless of the amount of taxable items. For example, if 25 jin of millet are levied per burden mu, 50 jin are levied for two burden mu, and 100 jin are levied for four burden mu, the tax amount is different, but the tax rate is the same. Progressive tax is different. It increases or decreases the tax rate according to the amount of taxable items. For example, the income tax for industry and commerce stipulates a tax rate from 5% to 25%, which is a progressive tax. For example, if the average of one burden mu per person is counted as one point, and the average of two burden mu is counted as 1.1 points, as stipulated by the former unified progressive tax, it is also a progressive tax. Therefore, the difference between the two lies in whether the tax rate is uniform or differentiated.

The calculation method of the new agricultural tax is as follows:
    (1) One shi (market shi) of grain (output) is counted as one "standard mu".
    (2) Deduct a tax-free point of one "standard mu" per person (the poor, those without labor, families of military personnel and martyrs, and widowers and the lonely elderly can deduct an additional two to five market dou).
    (3) Then deduct livestock consumption: 4 market dou for cattle and donkeys, and 7 market dou for mules and horses.
    (4) The remaining "standard mu" is the "burden mu".
    (5) The "burden mu" multiplied by the burden amount per burden mu is the tax payable.
There are two main formulas:
    1. Standard mu minus tax-free point minus livestock consumption equals burden mu.
    2. Burden mu multiplied by the burden amount per burden mu equals tax payable.
There are four auxiliary formulas:
    1. One shi of grain (ten market dou) equals one standard mu.
    2. Natural mu of land multiplied by the normal annual output per mu (market dou) divided by ten equals standard mu.
    3. Population multiplied by the tax-free point deducted per person equals the total tax-free points to be deducted for the whole family.
    4. Number of livestock multiplied by the number to be deducted per livestock equals the number of livestock consumption.

### 什么叫比例税？　比例税与累进税之区别

专栏：询问与答复

　　什么叫比例税？
　比例税与累进税之区别编辑同志：
    我对八月十四日关于“土改后农业税应否累进”的答复中，还有一些疑问，今再提出研究：
    目前大部地区土改已经完成，土地已大体达到平分，累进或者比例征收还有什么作用？究竟比例谁？试验结果我们认为吃亏的还是人少地稍多的户，也就是说鳏寡孤独。因此我对比例征收，有些不大同意，是否可按亩按产量征收？这些道理我们弄不清，请在报上详细解释为盼。
　　读者　立武
    答：新的农业税则，规定废除累进，按土地的常年应产量，扣除免税点和牲口消耗后，按户比例征收，正是适应土地改革后新的农村经济情况，发展生产，保障供给，使农民负担合理而制定的，与你所提按亩按产量征收的意见大体相同，你对比例征收不大同意，但因你没有把在村实地实验的方法具体材料写来，所以很难具体研究答复，根据来信，我们估计可能有下面几个情况：
    （一）可能根据太行区前拟之“比例加分”办法进行试验，但“比例加分”不是比例税，而是累进税的一种形式。
    （二）来信说：“试验结果，比例征收吃亏的是人口少土地稍多一些的户”，这是扣除免税点的影响，不是比例税的毛病（相反累进税倒是有累了人少地多户的毛病）。关于这一点，新税则用提高贫苦无劳力、军工烈属及鳏寡孤独的免税点的办法，来减轻扣除免税点在这一方面的反作用；保留适当免税点，是从调剂与平衡穷富地区的负担出发的，你如对保留免税点有意见还可提出研究。
    （三）来信说：“在土地平分后累进或者比例征收还有什么作用，究竟比例谁？很值得研究”，这可能是对比例税与累进税的区别不大清楚，因而在试验计算方法上有差误，我们愿将什么叫比例税及新农业税计算方法说明一下，供你参考。
    比例税与累进税的区别主要是关于税率的变动，比例税是规定一个课税标准，不论课税物件多寡皆课以同一的税率。例如一负担亩征收小米二十五斤，二个负担亩征五十斤，四个负担亩征收一百斤，税额虽不同，但税率则一样。累进税就不同了，它是按课税物件的多寡而高下其税率，如工商业所得税规定税率由百分之五至百分之廿五，便是累进税。又如每人平均一负担亩作一分，平均二负担亩的一亩作一点一分，象过去统累税规定的那样也是累进税，所以二者的区别在于税率一为均一，一为差别。
    新农业税计算法是这样的：
    （１）一石（市石）谷（产量）就算一个“标准亩”。
    （２）每人扣除一个“标准亩”的免税点（贫苦无劳力的军工烈属及鳏寡孤独可多扣除二至五市斗）。
    （３）再扣除牲口消耗牛驴四市斗，骡马七市斗。
    （４）剩下的“标准亩”就是“负担亩”。
    （５）“负担亩”再乘每负担亩负担量就是应纳税额。
    主要公式有两个：
    １、标准亩减免税点减牲口消耗等于负担亩。
    ２、负担亩乘每负担亩负担量等于应纳税额。
    补助公式四个：
    １、一石谷（十市斗）等于一个标准亩。
    ２、土地自然亩乘每亩常年应产量（市斗）以十除等于标准亩。
    ３、人口乘每人应扣免税点，等于全家应扣免税点数。
    ４、牲畜种数乘每牲畜应扣除数等于牲口除消耗数。　　——财政部
