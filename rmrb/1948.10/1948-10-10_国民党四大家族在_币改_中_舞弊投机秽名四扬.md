Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Comprehensive reports from foreign news agencies: The Kuomintang's four big families have engaged in bribery and speculation during this "currency reform," earning a notorious reputation. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Kuomintang Guangdong Province, used prior information to embezzle public funds and purchase a large amount of Hong Kong dollars on the eve of the "currency reform" (the amount, according to a Reuter's dispatch on the 2nd citing the New China Daily, reached 59 million Hong Kong dollars, while a certain pseudo-legislator said it was "at least five times this amount"), profiting 4 trillion legal currency. According to a United Press dispatch on September 24th, the large-scale purchase of Hong Kong dollars caused a very tense market situation, leading to soaring prices. It is said that current prices in Guangzhou have risen by 100% to 300% compared to before the "currency reform." This situation has even caused internal disputes within the Kuomintang, and the pseudo-Legislative Yuan has been conducting "critical reviews" for days, with Guangdong-籍 pseudo-legislators demanding the "impeachment" of Song Ziwen. According to reports from Datong and Reuter's, Kong Xiangxi's Yangzi Company also hoarded large quantities of auto parts, gasoline, woolen goods, etc. Xiong Shihui and Fu Zuoyi also hoarded large quantities of goods. The Kuomintang government carried out barbaric looting of the warehouses of general industrialists and merchants, but made excuses for Kong, Xiong, and Fu everywhere, saying: "These items do not belong to the category of necessities, and hoarding necessities is illegal and should be punished according to law" (Reuter's, October 2nd). According to a Datong News Agency report, Chiang Kai-shek publicly came forward to prevent and interfere with the Xiong and Fu scandals.

　　国民党四大家族在“币改”中
    舞弊投机秽名四扬
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合外国通讯社消息：国民党四大家族在此次“币改”中舞弊投机，秽名四扬。国民党广东省主席宋子文，利用事先获得消息，于“币改”前夕挪用公款套购巨量港币（其数量据美联社二日电引新中华日报讯称，达五百九千万元港币，而伪立委某则谓“至少要当此数的五倍”），获利四万亿元法币。据合众社九月二十四日电：由于大规模套购港币，造成市场非常的紧张状态，引起物价飞涨。据称，目前广州物价已较“币改”前上涨了百分之一百到三百。这种情形甚至已引起国民党内部的争吵，伪立法院连日进行“批评性检讨”，广东籍的伪立委要求“弹劾”宋子文。另据电通及美联社消息，孔祥熙经营的扬子公司也囤积了大批汽车零件、汽油、毛织品等。熊式辉及傅作义两人也囤积大批货物。国民党政府对于一般工商业家的仓库进行野蛮的掠夺，但是对于孔、熊、傅等人却处处为之开脱，说：“这些物品都不属于必需品类，囤积必需品才是非法的，才应依法惩办”（美联社十月二日电）。据电通社讯，蒋贼介石曾公然出面阻止干涉熊、傅丑案。
