Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Combined reports from various sources: Public school employees in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have faced successive tragic suicides driven by poverty and hunger. This is because after the "currency reform," salary adjustments based on the cost of living were halted, and salaries were further unreasonably cut. Xu Zhang, a teacher in the Foreign Languages Department of Tsinghua University in Peiping, committed suicide by taking sleeping pills on the evening of September 22 due to financial difficulties. Gu Yanbin, a lecturer at Nanjing Central University, committed suicide in Taicang, Jiangsu, on August 28 because his salary was too low to sustain a living. After the "currency reform," the salaries of public school employees in Taiwan Province were less than half of those in Shanghai and Nanjing, making their lives even more difficult. Zou Zuoyong, a clerk in the Civil Affairs Department of the Kuomintang Taiwan Provincial Government, and Zheng Zhenhong, a clerk in the Finance Department, successively jumped from buildings and into the sea in late September, committing suicide.

Due to excessively low salaries, the professors' association of national colleges and universities in Nanjing and over a thousand professors and associate professors from eight colleges and universities in Shanghai sent telegrams to the Kuomintang government on September 3rd and 12th, respectively, requesting improved compensation and increased subsidies for academic research. On October 13th, the presidents of more than ten national institutions in Peiping and Tianjin held a discussion in Peiping, deciding to jointly telegraph the Kuomintang Ministry of Education to improve the compensation of faculty, staff, and workers, increase graduate student stipends, and implement price controls or provide assistance in purchasing essential goods such as flour, oil, and salt needed for student meals in both cities. Seventy professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from Peking University gathered to discuss ways to maintain their livelihoods and resolved to demand that the Kuomintang government promptly adjust their compensation, provide two tons of winter coal per person as in previous years, and allocate one bag of flour per person per month.

　　蒋区公教人员生活更形困难
  　连续发生自杀惨剧
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合各方消息：国民党区公教人员因“币改”后停止按生活指数发薪，薪水复被无理削减，在贫困与饥饿煎迫下，连续发生自杀惨剧多起。北平清华大学外语系教员徐璋因生活困难，于九月二十二日晚服安眠药自杀。南京中央大学讲师顾雁宾，因待遇太低不能维持生活，于八月二十八日在江苏太仓自杀。“币改”后台湾省公教人员待遇不及沪宁的半数，生活更为窘迫。国民党台湾省政府民政厅科员邹作泳、财政厅科员郑振宏，相继于九月下旬跳楼、跳海自杀。
    因为薪给过低，南京国立专科以上学校教授会，上海八个专科以上学校教授、副教授千余人，先后于九月三日、十二日致电国民党政府，要求改善待遇，增加学术研究补助费。北平、天津十余国立院校校长十月十三日在北平举行谈话会时，决定联名电请国民党教育部改善教职员、工友待遇，提高研究生津贴，对两地学生膳食所需之面、油、盐等必需品，予以限价配售或代为购买。北京大学教授、讲师、助教等七十人，曾集会讨论维持生活办法，决议向国民党政府提出从速调整待遇、按去年例每人配售冬煤二吨、每人每月配粉一袋三项要求。
