　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: The people of Shandong Province are fully supporting the front lines in the Liberation of Jinan campaign. The first batch of 100,000 standing militiamen in the Luzhongnan District participated in supporting the front, with more than 57,000 serving on the front lines and more than 40,000 transporting supplies in the rear. In the Jiaodong District, people from 34 counties formed a strong support team of more than 60,000 people, organizing large teams including rubber-wheeled carts, small carts, stretchers, and carrying poles, capable of handling various tasks. In the Bohai District, more than 800 cadres participated in supporting the front lines. Militias from five counties, including Haiyang and Yaqian (newly established county), formed the "Jiaodong Participating Soldier Sons Regiment," responsible for escorting ammunition and prisoners. Under the slogan "Pay grain early, send it to the front," more than 10 million catties of public grain in Yizhong, Yidong (both newly established counties), Mengshan, and Xintai counties have been fully paid. The Binhai District has also completed the requisition of more than 6.22 million catties. Women in Lanling, Cangshan, and Zhao@ (all newly established counties) rushed to grind flour in large quantities and sent it to the front lines in the rain. Women in the Nanqiao District of Lanling ground 78,000 catties of flour in three days. Women's organizations in some districts and villages of Zhao@ organized flour grinding teams, taking collective shifts, working during the day and grinding at night. Women in Yibei (newly established county) rushed to make ××0,000 sets of cotton clothing in a short period. In a certain village in Pingdu, where one cook was originally required, more than 20 people signed up to participate. In a certain village in Qixia County, where two militiamen were required, 26 people signed up. The masses in the counties near Jinan City are even more enthusiastic in supporting the front, and the mobilization work for supporting the front is extremely smooth. The masses in the new districts of Zhangqiu and Licheng counties rushed to grind flour and chop firewood early, preparing to welcome the People's Liberation Army. The masses in a certain village in the county close to the front line secretly made stretchers in advance, preparing for the People's Liberation Army to attack the city. Everywhere, women and children could be heard happily saying, "Attack Jinan, capture Wang Yaowu alive!"
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 3rd】During the Jinan Campaign, when the People's Liberation Army's blocking forces requisitioned materials from residents in some new districts to build fortifications, they conducted good propaganda and education work and tried their best to take care of the residents' interests. When a requisition team of a certain regiment was conducting requisition, they patiently explained to the residents the importance of building fortifications, explaining that only by eliminating the bandit troops could they be relieved of the suffering of years of floods and bandit troops' ravages, and informed them of the democratic government's river repair, water management, and disaster relief in the old liberated areas. After such mobilization, various materials were delivered to the position on time the next day. A warm-hearted old woman even asked her son to carry her coffin board, but the troops immediately carried it back and returned it to her. The residents praised, "They are old troops after all!" Soldiers of a certain company formulated a plan to guarantee the protection of the masses' interests. The company's political instructor, members of the soldiers' committee for civilian affairs, and clerks formed a logistics and equipment group, and the clerk registered each borrowed item in a book and issued a borrowing certificate. On the borrowed wood and door panels, the company wrote the village and individual names, then painted over them with oil to prevent the writing from blurring after being rained on. When conducting propaganda and education among the residents, in addition to holding army-civilian get-togethers and mass meetings to explain the relationship between the People's Liberation Army and the people, many cadres personally went door-to-door to explain. A certain company formed a "temporary joint office" with the village cadres to unify the negotiation of requisitions and conduct timely propaganda and explanations. In the construction of fortifications, in order to protect the interests of the peasants as much as possible, many troops transplanted crops such as green rice and soybeans along with the soil to other places, which the residents were very satisfied with.

　　山东各地人民
    全力支援济南战役
    【新华社华东四日电】山东各地人民在解放济南战役中，全力支援前线。鲁中南区首批常备民工十万人参加支前，其中五万七千余人到前线服务，四万余人在后方担任运输。胶东区三十四县人民组成六万余人的强大支前队伍，组织有包括胶皮大车、小车、担架和挑子等的大队，能负担各种任务。渤海区参加支援前线的干部即有八百余人。海阳、牙前（新设县）等五县民兵，组成“胶东参战子弟兵团”，专负护送弹药、押送俘虏任务。在“早缴粮，送前方”口号下，沂中、沂东（均新设县）、蒙山、新泰等县一千余万斤公粮已全部缴纳完毕。滨海区也完成六百二十余万斤的征缴。兰陵、苍山、赵＠（均新设县）等县妇女大批赶磨面粉，冒雨送往前方。兰陵南桥区三天内磨好面粉七万八千斤。赵＠部分区村妇女组织磨面组，集体轮流变工，白天生产，晚上推磨。沂北（新设县）妇女短期赶制成棉衣××万套。平度某村原应出炊事员一名，报名参加者有二十余人。栖霞县某村应出民工二人，报名者达二十六人。济南市附近各县群众，支前情绪更为热烈，支前动员工作极为顺利。章（邱）、历（城）县新区群众都赶早磨好面粉，劈好木柴，准备迎接解放军。该县接近前线的某村群众，事先偷偷做好担架，准备解放军攻城。到处可以听到妇女儿童欢乐的说着：“打到济南府，活捉王耀武。”
    【新华社济南前线三日电】济南战役中，解放军阻击部队在向某些新区居民征借器材构筑工事时，进行了良好的宣传教育工作，并尽量照顾居民利益。某团征借组于进行征借时，耐心向居民说明修筑工事的重要，说明只有消灭匪军，才能解除他们多年所受水灾及匪军蹂躏的痛苦，并告以老解放区民主政府修河、治水、救灾情形。经过这样动员后，第二天各种器材即按时送到阵地。一位热心的老大娘把自己的寿木板也叫他儿子抬来，但部队立即抬去送还她。居民称赞说：“到底是老部队呀！”某连战士订立保证照顾群众利益的计划。该连政治指导员、战士委员会民运委员、文书等组成后勤器材组，对借来器材由文书逐一登记薄号，发给借物证。某连在借来的木材、门板上，在写下村名人名后用油涂上，以防淋雨后字迹模糊。在向居民进行宣传教育时，除举行军民联欢晚会、群众大会讲解解放军与人民的关系之外，许多干部都亲自挨户进行解释。某连与驻村干部组成“临时联合办公处”，统一接洽征借，并及时进行宣传解释。在修筑工事中，为了尽量保护农民利益，许多部队都做到把青禾、黄豆等庄稼连土铲起，移植到别处去，居民都很满意。
