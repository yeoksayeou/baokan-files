Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. TASS reports: The United Nations General Assembly began its committee activities on September 30th. The most important committee of the General Assembly, the Political and Security Committee, has begun discussing its first agenda item: the report of the Atomic Energy Commission. Soviet representative Vyshinsky stated in a speech at the meeting on October 1st that the failure of the Atomic Energy Commission's work was due to the U.S. delegation's stubborn refusal to accept all proposals to ban atomic weapons and destroy existing atomic bombs. Vyshinsky pointed out that the United States' retention of atomic weapons is because some political figures in the United States harbor illusions, even today believing that the United States still monopolizes atomic energy. Dewey recently stated in a speech in Phoenix that the United States exclusively monopolizes atomic secrets. Truman had previously expressed satisfaction with the results of testing new "improved" atomic bombs. U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lilienthal had also declared that the United States should maintain atomic secrets for as long as possible. Vyshinsky strongly criticized these illusions, and emphasized: "Those who believe that only one country monopolizes atomic energy and atomic bombs are making a serious mistake, a very dangerous miscalculation. China (Kuomintang) today has stated that it will not manufacture atomic bombs, and perhaps some other countries will say the same, but there are also some countries that will not say this, because saying so would not be in accordance with the facts." Representatives from the United States, Britain, and Canada also delivered speeches at the meeting, vigorously defending the so-called "American Plan" in the Atomic Energy Commission. While the Political and Security Committee is meeting, the main committees on economic and financial affairs, social, humanitarian and cultural affairs, trusteeship, administrative and budgetary affairs, and legal affairs have also begun work, or have elected their respective committee vice-chairmen and secretaries, or have begun discussing their agendas.

　　联大政治安全委员会上
    维辛斯基再次强调指出
    原子弹已非秘密
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社讯：联合国大会已于九月三十日起开始进入各委员会活动的阶段。大会最重要的委员会——政治安全委员会已开始讨论其第一项议题：原子能委员会的报告。苏代表维辛斯基于十月一日在会上发表演说称，原子能委员会工作的失败，系由于美国代表团顽固地拒绝一切禁止原子武器与毁灭现存原子弹的建议。维氏指出，美国之保持原子武器，是因为美国很有一些政界人物存有幻想，他们甚至在今天还以为美国还垄断着原子能。杜威日前在费匿克斯演说称，美国单独垄断着原子秘密。杜鲁门前此对新的“改良”原子弹的试验结果表示满意。美国原子能委员会主席李连塞尔亦曾宣称，美国要尽可能长期的保持原子秘密。维氏力斥这些幻想，并强调指出：“相信只有一个国家垄断着原子能和原了弹的人，犯了一个严重的错误，这会造成非常严重的危险的错误估计。中国（国民党）今天曾谈它不会制造原子弹，也许某些其他国家也会这样说，但是，也有些国家将不这样说，因为这样说并不符合事实。”美英加代表亦在会上发表演说，极力为原子能委员会中的所谓“美国计划”进行辩护。和政治安全委员会集会的同时，经济财政、社会人道文化、托管、行政及预算、法律等主要委员会亦开始工作，或已选出各该委员会之副主席及秘书，或已开始其议程的讨论。
