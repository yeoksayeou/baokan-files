　　Enhancing the Organizational and Educational Role of Party Meetings

The meetings of grassroots Party organizations occupy a huge and important position in all Party life. Party meetings are the highest organs of grassroots Party organizations and one of the basic methods of educating Communist Party members in the spirit of Bolshevik Party spirit.

Comrade Stalin, in his doctrine on the question of building the Party organization, paid great attention to Party meetings and their role in the life of the Party organization. Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The most important issues of our Party's actions, of course, except for those that are urgent or involve military and diplomatic secrets, must be discussed at Party meetings." This discussion is free and realistic. It will enhance the enthusiasm of Party members, increase their sense of responsibility in their organizational positions, teach them to connect their daily work with the Party's general tasks, and make Party meetings a large school with practical educational significance. As Comrade Stalin taught us, in order to enhance the enthusiasm of the Party masses, it is necessary to bring issues of interest to them to their attention and ensure free criticism and serious and comprehensive discussion.

The organizational and educational significance of Party meetings comes from the basic principles of Bolshevik Party building, because the Bolshevik Party is an organization with lively, rich, and profound internal life.

One of the basic shortcomings of Party meetings is that some local Party organs do not take into account local specific conditions, and they excessively restrict the issues that should be discussed at Party meetings from above. This suppresses the creativity and enthusiasm of grassroots Party organizations.

Naturally, some issues should be discussed in all Party organizations throughout the province or region. However, these issues are still few. In general, the issues that should be discussed on the agenda of Party meetings should all be related to the life of the Party organization in the department. This is one of the conditions for enhancing the organizational and educational role of Party meetings, and it is also one of the conditions for developing the enthusiasm and initiative of Party members and probationary members.

Experience shows that the more actively these issues related to the life of the unit are discussed, the more it can stimulate the emotions of all Party members and arouse their interest in participation. However, this does not mean that those who participate in the discussion can only limit themselves to talking about issues within their own unit. On the contrary, the more specific the issues are raised, the closer they are to Party members, the more they can be discussed at a higher principled level, and the more closely local work can be linked to the general tasks proposed by the Party.

Regrettably, there are still some Party leading organs that believe that trivial supervision is better than stipulating systems and giving play to the initiative and autonomy of local organizations. For example, this has happened in Donbass, and such facts still exist in many organizations.

For example, in the Alexander District of Vladimir Province, the meetings of many grassroots organizations are conducted at a low level, withering, sticking to conventions, and lacking criticism and self-criticism. This phenomenon is caused by the fact that issues that are directly related to the life of the district's enterprises or collective farms are rarely brought up for discussion at meetings. Because the District Party Committee, when formulating the agenda, does not take into account the specific local conditions, but instead stipulates on its own which issues need to be discussed and which issues do not need to be discussed. Here, a rule has been established: since a certain issue has been discussed and passed a resolution at the meeting of the District Party Committee, then this resolution must be discussed at the meetings of all grassroots Party organizations. Therefore, after a regular meeting of the District Party Committee, it was proposed that each grassroots organization discuss the following five issues as a whole: the issue of implementing the District Party Committee's enlarged meeting resolution on the Party's organizational work in the Romanov Township Soviet; the issue of implementing the resolutions of the Provincial Party Congress; summarizing and inspecting the preparations for sowing in collective farms; the issue of how the Party organization of the Khlopov Township Soviet prepared for sowing in its leadership; and the issue of launching socialist competition.

These issues resolved by the District Party Committee are far from being of interest to all Party organizations in the district. Therefore, their discussion, as expected, was lifeless and lacked the full enthusiasm of Party members. Of course, what kind of enthusiasm can be aroused by discussing such a resolution as the resolution on the Party's organizational work in the Romanov Township Soviet, which is just a pile of official clichés, such as: "Instruct to rebuild the Party's political and organizational work..." "Mobilize all Party members..." "Hold joint meetings of group leaders..." "Strengthen the propaganda and education work of all personnel..." and so on. It is not surprising that discussing such generalized resolutions cannot arouse the concern and enthusiasm of Party members and will fall into empty forms.

The reporter of the Novosibirsk Pravda also reported the same situation. In some districts here, there is also very interesting, excessive, unnecessary, and harmful regulation of Party meetings, deciding the agenda of meetings from above, and suppressing the initiative of local organizations. There are many such situations, that is, Party members only know the agenda when they arrive at the meeting place, they have no possibility to think about the issues in advance, and they have no possibility to link the meeting with local work and prepare their speeches. Therefore, ordinary Party members in these organizations rarely speak from the podium, and the "fixed" speakers are the ones who speak frequently.

In many districts of the Kuibyshev Province, the phenomenon of rigidly stipulating the agenda of Party meetings has also reached such a point that many lower-level Party organizations do not have time to discuss the resolutions sent to them by the Provincial Party Committee and the District Party Committee. The initiative of grassroots Party organizations is suppressed, and their hands are tied. Obviously, there are many issues in each organization that have matured, they stimulate the emotions of all Party members, and undoubtedly, the discussion of these issues will be carried out with a high degree of enthusiasm. However, this possibility of Party organizations is deprived, and they have to discuss the resolutions of the Provincial Party Committee and the District Party Committee on time....

This fact is contrary to the basic principles of Party building. It weakens the organizational and educational role of Party meetings, reduces the enthusiasm and initiative of Party members and their sense of responsibility in front of their own Party organizations, and generally weakens the Party's organizational and political work.

The educational role of Party meetings can be enhanced if the agenda of Party meetings is not limited to the "daily issues" of a certain movement in the economic work routinely carried out by this or that leading organ, but includes the basic issues of the political and ideological education work of the Party organization.

The Communist Party—the long-tested vanguard of the Soviet people—is leading all working people in the struggle to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and build communism. In this struggle, every Party organization is enriching its own experience, proposing and solving the most complicated issues, which are closely related to mobilizing our internal economic resources, enhancing the political and labor enthusiasm of the masses, and educating the working masses in the cause of communism. The meeting of the Party organization is our Party's court, the sharpest and most principled issues must be brought to this court, and the resolutions passed here should reflect the experience of the Party masses, reflect the degree of political maturity, and expose everything that hinders our movement from moving forward. That is to say, the most important task of all Party organizations lies in striving to continue to enhance the organizational and educational role of Party meetings, further enhance the ideological level of meetings, and more bravely and sharply unfold Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, and this criticism and self-criticism is a powerful weapon in our Party's hands and the law of our movement towards communism.

The work of that Party organization cannot be successful if it does not hold frequent meetings and does not raise the most important issues at the discussion meetings of Party members. Here, not only should work meetings be held, but also meetings of the entire factory, the entire organ, and the Party organization. If the Party committee and branch do not convene a general meeting of all Party members, they will lose contact with Party members and practically abandon supervision of Party members. When the secretary of the Party organization reports at the regular meeting on the degree of implementation of the resolutions passed at the previous meeting, it must be sincere and comprehensive. Where this regulation can be grasped, the enthusiasm of Party members can be enhanced, making them feel that not only are resolutions passed at the meeting, but these resolutions are the regulations of all Party members, and they must be implemented.

The preparation and conduct of Party meetings should further help enhance the initiative and autonomy of all Party members and all Party organizations, further help enhance their sense of responsibility in front of the Party organizations in their respective work departments, and their vanguard role in the struggle for the Five-Year Plan, for the greater prosperity of our socialist motherland, and for the victory of communism.

### 提高党的会议的组织和教育作用

　　提高党的会议的组织和教育作用
    基层党组织的会议，在一切党内生活中，占有巨大而重要的地位。党的会议，是基层党组织的高级机关，是以布尔什维克党性的精神教育共产党员的基本方法之一。
    斯大林同志在其建党组织问题的学说中，给予党的会议及其在党组织生活中的作用以极大的注意。斯大林同志指出：“我们党的行动底最重要的问题，当然，除了那些急不容绥或属军事和外交秘密以外的问题，一定必须在党的会议上讨论”。这种讨论是自由的，是实事求是的。是会提高党员的积极性，提高他们在组织内部工作地位的责任心，教导他们把自己的日常工作与党的总任务联系起来，并使党的会议成为一所大的有实际教育意义的学校。正如斯大林同志所教导我们的那样，为提高党员群众的积极性，必须把对他们有兴趣的问题提到他们的面前，并保障能够自由批评及认真全面讨论。
    党的会议之所以具有组织作用和教育意义，是由布尔什维克党建党基本原则而来的，因为布尔什维克党是具有生动活泼、丰富而深刻内容之内部生活的组织。
    党的会议底基本缺点之一，就在于某些地方党的机关毫不照顾当地的具体条件，它们过分地从上面限制党的会议上所应提出讨论的问题，这样一来，就压抑了基层党组织底创造性和积极性。
    自然，有些问题应当在全省或全区的所有党的组织内进行讨论。但这些问题毕竟还是不多，一般来说，应该在党的会议底议事日程上去讨论的问题，应都是与本部门党组织生活有联系的问题。这乃是提高党的会议底组织作用和教育意义的条件之一，这也是发展党员和候补党员的积极性和主动性的条件之一。
    经验证明，正是这些与本单位的生活有联系的问题讨论得越是积极，就越能刺激全体党员的情绪，并引起他们参加的兴趣。然而这绝不是说，在讨论问题时，参加会议的人都只能局限于谈自己单位范围之内的问题。相反，问题提得愈具体，愈能接近党员，也就愈能在更高的原则水平上进行讨论，也就愈能使当地的工作与党提出的总任务更紧密地联系。
    遗憾的是，还有这样一些党的领导机关，它们认为琐碎的监督比规定制度与发挥当地组织底主动性和自动性还要好。譬如，顿巴斯就有过这样的事情，这样的事实现在还在许多组织中存在着。
    例如弗拉季米尔省亚历山大区，该区许多基层组织的会议是在低级水平上进行的。凋萎不振，墨守成规，没有批评及自我批评。这种现象是因为那些本来与本区的企业部门或集体农场的生活有直接联系的问题很少提到会议上讨论而产生的。因为区党委会拟定议事日程时，并不顾及当地的具体条件，而是自己规定出那些问题需要讨论，那些问题不需要讨论。在这里创立了这样一种规章：既然某一问题在区党委会议上讨论并通过了决议的话，那么这一决议就非在所有基层党组织的会议上讨论不可。因此，在某一次区党委例会之后，就提议各基层组织讨论整个的下列五个问题：执行区党委扩大会关于罗曼诺夫乡苏维埃党的组织决议的问题；关于执行省党代表大会决议的问题；总结检查集体农场的播种准备；关于赫洛波夫乡苏维埃党组织领导上如何准备播种的问题；关于开展社会主义竞赛的问题。
    区党委所决议的这些问题，远非是该区所有党的组织都有兴趣的问题。因此，它们的讨论，正如所预期的一样，进行得没有生气，没有党员充分的积极性。当然，讨论这样的决议，如象关于罗曼诺夫乡苏维埃党组织的决议，能有什么积极性呢，该决议只是一些官样文章的词句的堆垒，例如：“责成重建党的政治工作和组织工作……”“动员全体党员……”“举行组长联席会……”“加强全体人员的宣教工作……”等等。讨论这样一般化的决议，不能引起党员的关怀和积极性，并流于空洞的形式，这是不足为奇的。
    新西伯里斯克真理报记者也报导了同样的情况。此地某些区里同样十分有兴趣的、过分的、不需要的及有害的去规定党的会议，从上面决定会议的议事日程，压抑着当地组织的主动性。有许多这样的情形，即党员们到了会场上才能知道议事日程，他们没有可能预先思想问题，没有可能把会议与当地工作联系起来并准备发言。所以在这些组织内的普通党员很少上过讲台讲话，而经常讲话的主要是那“固定的”演说家们。
    在古比雪夫省的许多区，死板规定党的会议底议事日程的现象，亦达到了这样的地步，竟然使许多下层党的组织来不及讨论省委和区委寄给他们的决议。基层党组织的主动性被压抑着，他们的手被束缚着。显然的，每个组织内都有不少的问题已经成熟，它们刺激着全体党员的情绪，无疑地，这些问题的讨论一定会在高度积极性的情况下进行的。但是党组织的这种可能性被剥夺了，它们只得按时讨论省委和区委的决议……。
    这种事实和建党的基本原则是矛盾的，它削弱着党的会议底组织和教育作用，降低着党员们的积极性和主动性及其在自己党组织面前的责任心，并使党的组织和党的政治工作普遍地减弱。
    如果党的会议底议事日程不局限于关于此一或彼一领导机关照例的那些经济工作的某种运动等“日常问题”，如果它包括着党组织的政治及思想教育工作底基本问题，那么党的会议底教育作用就能提高。
    共产党——久经考验的苏联人民底先锋队——正在领导着全体劳动者进行为提早完成战后五年计划及建设共产主义的斗争。在这一斗争中每个党的组织都丰富着自己的经验，提出并解决着最烦杂的问题，这些问题与动员我们内部的经济财源，与提高群众的政治和劳动的积极性，与教育劳动群众的共产主义事业，都是紧密联系着的。党的组织底会议，这是我们党的法庭，是尖锐的最原则的问题要提到这个法庭上来，在这里通过的决议应该反映党员群众的经验，反映政治上成熟的程度，揭发阻碍我们运动前进的一切东西。这就是说，一切党的组织底最重要的任务，就在于求得继续提高党的会议底组织及教育作用，进一步提高会议的思想水平，更勇敢地、更尖锐地展开布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，而这种批评与自我批评，正是我们党手中的有力武器，它是我们走向共产主义运动的规律。
    那个党的组织不经常开会，同时，在党员的讨论会上不提出最重要的问题，那个组织的工作就不可能有成绩。在这里，不仅要召开工作间的、而且要召开全工厂的、全机关的、党组织的会议。党的委员会和支部，若不召开全体党员的大会，那就要丧失与党员的联系，并实际上放弃对党员的监督。当党组织的书记在例会上报告上次会议所通过的决议之执行程度时，必须是恳切的、全面的。哪里能掌握这一法规，哪里党员的积极性就能提高，使他们感觉到，不仅在会议上通过决议，并且这些决议是全体党员的法规，并把它们实现。
    党的会议之准备及进行，应当更加有助于提高全体党员和一切党组织之主动性和自动性，更加有助于提高他们在其所属工作部门中的党组织面前的责任感，及他们在为五年计划，为我们社会主义祖国底更加繁荣，为共产主义底胜利而斗争中的先锋作用。　　　　　　（张天恩译自一九四八年六月八日真理报）
