　　A Man of Chu Marks the Boat to Find His Sword

    A page of study notes
    There is a story in "Lüshi Chunqiu" about a man of Chu who marked the boat to find his sword. The original purpose of the story is to ridicule stubborn people. Recently, I saw a popular publication adapt the story into a very typical story ridiculing empiricism. The general idea is: During the Warring States period, a man from the State of Chu went mountain climbing with his treasured sword. When he reached the edge of a cliff, he carelessly dropped his sword. It was late at the time, so he made a mark where the sword fell. The next morning, he ran to look for it and, sure enough, he found it. Later, he traveled by boat and accidentally dropped his sword into the water again. He made a mark on the side of the boat, and when the boat docked, he took off his clothes and went down to look for it. The boat had traveled dozens of miles; how could he find it?
    After reading this story, you might laugh at how foolish this man of Chu was. But don't be so quick to laugh. Think about your own work. Have you ever made similar mistakes? Probably quite often; but unconsciously, and you even think you are right. Ignoring the time, place, and circumstances, and applying a set of experiences to another situation in the same way, is one expression of empiricism.
    There is a famous saying in Chapter Four, Section Two of the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Everything depends on time, place, and conditions." What does this sentence mean? For example, the man of Chu was right to make a mark when he dropped his sword on the mountain, but it was wrong to do the same on the boat. We would say he's crazy if he wears a cotton coat in the summer; he would freeze to death if he doesn't wear a cotton coat in the winter. We oppose unjust, aggressive, and enslaving wars, but we firmly support just, defensive, and patriotic wars. During the Anti-Japanese War, emphasizing guerrilla warfare was correct based on the comparison of strength between the enemy and ourselves; now, it is wrong not to emphasize regularization. Implementing equal distribution of land in the old and semi-old liberated areas was correct, but immediately implementing equal distribution of land in the newly liberated areas without going through a certain process would be a left-leaning, adventurous mistake.
    Committing empiricist errors often means forgetting this famous saying: "Everything depends on time, place, and conditions." The third article of the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification work in 1948 addresses the problem of empiricism. It says: "In cadre meetings and in work, we must educate cadres to be good at analyzing specific situations, and to determine the local and current work tasks and methods based on the specific circumstances of different regions and different historical conditions. We must distinguish between cities and rural areas, and we must distinguish between old areas, semi-old areas, areas bordering the enemy, and new areas, otherwise we will make mistakes."
    Lenin said: "The soul of Marxism is the concrete analysis of concrete things." Many of our comrades lack an analytical mind. They are unwilling to conduct repeated and in-depth analysis and research on complex things, and instead, they love to draw simple conclusions based on narrow experience. This situation should be improved in the future. When deciding on work tasks and methods, we must first analyze the specific situation. The so-called analysis of the specific situation is to see what the "time, place, and conditions" are like. If we keep the famous saying from the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in mind at all times, we may be able to make fewer empiricist errors.

　　楚人刻舟求剑
    学习笔记一页
    “吕氏春秋”上有一则楚人刻舟求剑的故事，那故事的本旨是讥讽固执的人。最近看到一本通俗刊物上把那故事加以改编，改成一篇很典型的讥讽经验主义的故事。大意是说：战国时楚国有一人配带了宝剑去游山，走到山崖边，不当心把剑掉下去了，当时天时已晚，他就在掉剑的地方做了一个记号，次日天明他就跑去找寻，果然找到了。后来他乘船旅行，又不小心把剑掉下水了，他就在船边划了一道记号，等船停泊下来的时候，他脱光衣服下去找，船已行了几十里，哪里能找到呢？
    读了这则故事，也许你会嘲笑这楚人何等愚蠢。且先不忙笑，想一想自己的工作，是否也犯过和他相类似的错误？恐怕是经常会发现的；不过是不自觉的，而且自己还觉得很对。不顾时间、地点、情况，把一套经验照样搬到另种场合去应用，就是经验主义的一种表现。
    联共（布）党史第四章第二节上有一句名言：“一切决定于时间、地点、条件。”这句话怎讲？比如那个楚人吧，他在山上掉了宝剑做下记号是对的，但坐船也照样去做就不对了。夏天穿棉衣，我们会说他发疯；冬天不穿棉衣会冻死。不义的侵略、奴役的战争，我们是反对的；但正义的、自卫的、爱国的战争，我们却坚决拥护。抗日战争时期，根据敌我力量的对比，那时候强调游击战是对的；现在呢，不强调正规化则是错误的。老的半老的解放区实行平分土地是正确的，新解放区不经过一定的过程立即就实行平分土地，就会犯左倾冒险的错误。
    犯经验主义错误常常忘掉了这句名言：“一切决定于时间、地点、条件。”中央关于一九四八年土改和整党工作的指示中的第三条就是针对经验主义的毛病而提出的，那上面说：“在干部会议中及在工作中，必须教育干部善于分析具体情况，从不同地区、不同历史条件的具体情况出发，决定当地当时的工作任务和工作方法。必须区别城市和农村的不同，必须区别老区、半老区、接敌区和新区的不同，否则就要犯错误。”
    列宁说：马克思主义的灵魂就是对于具体事物的具体分析，我们许多同志缺乏分析头脑，对于复杂的事物，不愿做反复深入的分析研究，而爱根据狭隘的经验，做简单的结论。今后应该改善这种状况，在决定工作任务和工作方法时，首先就要分析具体情况。所谓分析具体情况，就是要看“时间、地点、条件”如何。时时刻刻都记着联共党史上那句名言，经验主义的错误也许可以少犯一些。
