    To Li Furui from the Eighth District of Jingxing:
    According to what you said, it is wrong to extract seven mu of land from your family because your family's land is less than the average and it was not voluntary. In the concluding land reform work, land equivalent to the average should be supplemented. To Jianhua from the Third District of Zuoquan:
    It is wrong for someone in your village to occupy the house of a wrongly struggled household and refuse to vacate it because of discord between father and son and no place to live. Since his father has surplus houses, it should be resolved within his family as much as possible. To Anzhen from Pingshan:
    If your family relied entirely on its own labor and had no exploitation for the five years before the incident, then you are certainly not a landlord or rich peasant. It is wrong to classify you as a "landlord root." There is no such provision in the 1933 class classification documents. To Guangwu from the Zhengding Rural Service Group:
    In some villages in the Fifth District of Nanle during the land reform, after the land of landlords and rich peasants was confiscated or requisitioned with green seedlings, it should not be collected from landlords and rich peasants again at the original rate when requisitioning public grain. Your opinion has been forwarded to the Nanle County Committee for them to check. To Wang Runtang from Gaocheng:
    Regarding your family issues, as you requested, it has been forwarded to the Gaocheng County Committee for them to investigate and resolve. To He Xin from Shijiazhuang City:
    This household you mentioned has workshops and shops, employs workers, makes and sells pickles and dim sum, and operates it personally, using this as the main source of income. Its class status is that of an industrial and commercial capitalist. Their family occupies a large amount of land, does not work themselves, and relies entirely on hired labor for cultivation, so their family should be classified as landlords. In addition, the confiscated landlord's handicraft tools should be returned. If they have been consumed, appropriate compensation can be considered based on the specific circumstances. To Zhao Shande from Gudao Village, Tang County:
    According to what you said, if your family is indeed a middle peasant, it is wrong for the village to extract and exchange your land without your consent. In addition, the cloth of a rich middle peasant household in your village should also not be confiscated. To Comrade Liu Fengqing:
    Ilyich is Lenin. To Dong Huamin from Shijiazhuang:
    If the relationship between husband and wife deteriorates, and the wife is abused and beaten by the husband, they can divorce. If the husband does not agree, the government should be petitioned to resolve it. The land divided after the divorce can be taken away. To Comrade Li Min from the North China Military Region:
    After the land reform, the family should be divided according to the average number of mu per capita in the whole family. It is inappropriate for your family to divide according to the old social methods. You were assigned less land, which should be resolved from within the family. If it is proven that your second uncle did indeed embezzle when he was a puppet Bao chief, he should compensate the masses, and he cannot be exempted from compensation because he is a middle peasant. The amount of compensation should be determined according to the actual amount of embezzlement. To Qin Chunfeng from the Jincheng Bookstore:
    Your suggestion regarding using the telephone to send telegrams has been forwarded to the Transportation Department of the North China Government for research and reference. To Tingbei from Pingshun County:
    Regarding the Mangyan Elementary School issue, it has been forwarded to the Pingshun Education Section for them to investigate and handle.

    井陉八区李福瑞君：
    据你所谈，你家土地既不够平均数，又非自愿，抽出你七亩地，是不对的。在结束土改工作中应补足相当于平均数的土地。左权三区建华君：
    你村某人因父子不和，分居没房住，占着错斗户的房子不腾是不对的，既然他父亲有多余房子，应尽可能在其家庭内调剂解决。平山安镇君：
    若从事变前五年你家完全靠自己劳动，又无剥削，当然不是地主富农。把你划为“地主根”是错误的。一九三三年划阶级文件中并无此规定。正定乡村服务团光武君：
    南乐五区有几个村在土改中，地富的土地带着青苗被没收或征收后，到征公粮时，不应再按原地数向地富征收。你的意见，已转寄南乐县委会，请他们检查。藁城王润堂君：
    关于你的家庭问题，已照你所嘱，转寄藁城县委会，请他们调查解决。石家庄市何信君：
    你所提的这一户，有作坊有店铺，雇用工人，制卖酱菜点心，亲自经营，并以此为生活主要来源，其成份为手工业资本家。其家中占有较多土地，自己不劳动，完全靠雇工耕种，故其家中应为地主成份。另外，没收的地主手工业工具，应予退还，如已耗损，可斟酌具体情况，适当补偿。唐县古道口村赵善德君：
    照你所说你家如确是中农，村中不经你的同意抽换你的土地是不对的。另外，你村一户富裕中农的布匹亦不应没收。刘逢清同志：
    伊里奇即是列宁。石家庄董化民君：
    夫妇感情恶化，女方并被男方虐待打骂，可以离婚，男方不允，应呈请政府解决。离婚后分的土地可以带走。华北军区李民同志：
    土改后分家照理应按全家人口地亩平均数来分，你家仍按旧社会的办法分是不合适的。你分的地少，应从家中解决。你二叔当伪保长时，如经证明确有贪污事实，应赔偿群众，不能因是中农而不赔偿。赔偿数目则应按实际贪污多少而定。晋城书店秦春风君：
    你所提关于用电话拍发电报的建议，已转华北政府交通部研究参考。平顺县廷北君：
    关于蟒岩小学问题，已转平顺教育科，请他们调查处理。
