　　Tokyo and Yokohama Electrical Workers Strike
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th] News from various sources: Electrical workers in Tokyo and Yokohama held a strike on the 24th, according to the union's decision, to protest the Ashida government's following of MacArthur Headquarters' instructions, using compulsory arbitration measures to prevent workers' wage increase demands. Tokyo electrical workers struck for half an hour, causing Tokyo's streetcars and subways to stop running for half an hour at noon; several busy areas of Tokyo, such as Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ginza, and Asakusa, had power outages for ten minutes starting at 10 p.m. Yokohama electrical workers struck for one hour, causing more than 70 large factories in the area to shut down for one hour. Prior to this, the Japan Postal Workers' Union had issued an open letter demanding the resignation of the Ashida government, condemning it for evading responsibility for resolving wage issues and depriving workers of all basic rights.
