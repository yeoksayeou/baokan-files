Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the Kuomintang-controlled areas are experiencing widespread famine and a sharp decline in grain production this year, while the Kuomintang government's plunder of food has intensified. According to the Tianjin Xin Xing Daily of September 24th, the quota for the 37th year of land tax collection and borrowing determined by the pseudo-Executive Yuan has increased in all provinces compared to the 36th year. Seeing that its ruling area is becoming increasingly impoverished, the Kuomintang government concentrates its efforts on large-scale extortion in the southern provinces. The land tax quota is about 60 million shi, of which rice accounts for 50 million shi, and wheat accounts for the remaining 10 million shi. In addition, various plunders are being carried out: among them, the military grain item, according to the article "Nightmare in Paradise" published in the Beiping Xin Lu Weekly on September 4th, lists the purchase situation in various counties in the south of the Yangtze River. On average, each county is about 200,000 shi, and the purchase price is half of the market price. The grain allocated to the six cities (Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Guangzhou) for cheap purchases and expensive sales, which is purchased by the Grain Emergency Storage and Purchase Committee, is more than 500,000 tons, and half of it is forcibly purchased in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Sichuan Province, which has suffered the most from natural disasters and Chiang Kai-shek's calamity, according to the article "Perspective on Farmland and Rural Areas in Western Sichuan" in the Shanghai Observation Weekly, Volume 5, Issue 4, this year, the grain extorted by the Kuomintang government has reached 24.8 million market shi. Wang Lingji, chairman of the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Government, told reporters that Chiang Kai-shek ordered the province to transport 526,000 bags of military grain, each bag containing one shi and three dou and three sheng, before the end of November.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th: In the Kuomintang-controlled areas north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, which is separated from Nanjing by a river, movements of people resisting the Kuomintang's conscription atrocities have occurred one after another recently. In Li'er Township, Jiangdu (i.e., Yangzhou), more than 2,000 people destroyed the Kuomintang District Office, beat up the Kuomintang District Chief, Self-Defense Captain, and Township Chief, forcing them to release the conscripted soldiers. In Shitou Ao, Huaian County, the conscripted soldiers took advantage of the fact that most of the bandit soldiers on the escort ship went ashore to cook, and together they threw the two bandit soldiers on the ship into the canal, and all fled. The people resisting conscription in the Kuomintang area have received assistance from the people's armed forces in the liberated area. The Qidong District Team of Haijun County (newly established county) killed and wounded Gu Sheng, the military section chief of the enemy's Chengdong District Office, and ten others in Huian Town on September 27th, rescuing more than 100 conscripted soldiers. The Sixth Detachment of Longwang Township in Jingtai County (newly established county) also rescued more than 50 conscripted soldiers. The Taixian armed forces have been sweeping the Ru (Gao) Hai (An) line for several days, crushing the enemy's plan to conscript 30 soldiers from each township.
