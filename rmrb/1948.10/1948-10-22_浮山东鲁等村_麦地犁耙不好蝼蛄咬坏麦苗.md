Taiyue Dispatch: In Fushan, Donglu, and five other villages, poor plowing and harrowing during wheat planting have resulted in mole crickets damaging wheat seedlings. Efforts are currently underway to replant and prevent further damage. In Donglu Village, after most of the wheat had been sown, it was suddenly discovered that some seedlings were dying in sections. For example, in Guo Yubin's nine mu of wheat, one-tenth had died by the 17th, and by the afternoon of the 19th, more than one-third had died. In another family's field, one mu out of two mu had withered. The wheat seedlings of Quan Congsheng, Yao Huaiyuan, and others were also dying severely. Similar situations were reported in Cui Village, Nanwang, and other villages. The masses were discussing the reasons, with some saying it was planted too early and the ground was too hot, others saying it was due to poor plowing and harrowing, and still others saying it was due to old stubble and weeds. A superstitious rumor spread in Nanwang and other villages, claiming that the year was bad and wheat should not be planted in August, as it would wither and die. Cadres immediately conducted an in-depth inspection. Guo Chengren, a member of the Donglu Farmers' Association Standing Committee, found that the damage was caused by mole crickets biting through the roots along the wheat rows, doing so quickly and covering several zhang at a time, making them difficult to catch. A meeting was held to discuss the issue, and the main reasons were determined to be poor plowing and harrowing, leading to excessive weeds, which facilitated insect breeding. Secondly, the seeds were not mixed with black alum for prevention, which further aided insect development. To remedy this loss, the masses were immediately organized to replant, with fields where the damage was severe being harrowed and replanted. To prevent the wheat seedlings from being completely killed by mole crickets, the masses were called upon to mix black alum, sanitary spheres, mustard, and other insecticidal materials with the wheat seeds during replanting.

　　浮山东鲁等村
  　麦地犁耙不好蝼蛄咬坏麦苗
    【太岳电】浮山东鲁等五村种麦犁耙不好，麦苗被蝼蛄咬坏，现正设法补种与防止。东鲁村在麦子已大部种完后，忽然发现有的麦苗一段一段的枯死。如郭玉彬的九亩麦子，十七号看时死了十分之一，到十九号下午再看时，已死了三分之一以上。另有一家麦子，二亩地就枯死了一亩。其他如权从圣、姚怀源等的麦苗也死的很厉害。崔村、南王等村均有这种情形。群众纷纷议论，有的说是种的太早了地热，有的说是犁耙的不好，又有的说是茬老了草打了。南王等村流行着一种迷信传说，说天年不好，八月不能种麦，种了就要枯死等。干部即深入检查，东鲁农会常委郭成仁，在地里检查的结果，是蝼蛄顺着麦垄从根咬断的，咬的很快，一滚就是几丈，不容易捉住。又开会研究，主要原因是犁耙不好，草大，所以容易生虫。其次没把种耔拌黑矾预防，就更便利虫的发展。为了补救这种损失，当即组织群众进行补种，死的多的地里耙了再种。为了使麦苗不致全被蝼蛄咬死，号召群众再种时麦籽里拌黑矾、卫生球面子、芥子等杀虫药料。
