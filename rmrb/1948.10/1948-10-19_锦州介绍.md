　　Introduction to Jinzhou
    Jinzhou is an industrial city in Northeast China, an important railway junction, and the largest supply base and important strategic stronghold of the Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast.
    Jinzhou is located at the northeastern end of the Liaoxi Corridor, on the west bank of the lower reaches of the Xiaoling River, backed by the remaining veins of the Songling Mountains on the border of Rehe and Liaoning in the north, and facing the coastal plain at the mouth of the Xiaoling River in the south. The terrain is high in the north and low in the south, and the city is surrounded by hills. It is located in the south-central part of the Guandong section of the Beining Railway, about 500 li northeast of Shenyang and about 400 li southwest of Shanhaiguan. To the north, there is a railway to Yixian, which can turn west to Beipiao and Chengde, which is the Jin-Cheng Railway. From Yixian to the northeast, it can reach Fuxin and Xinlitun via the Xin-Yi Railway, and connect to the Da(hushan)-Tong(liao) Road in the north, directly reaching northern Manchuria. It has always been a commercial center for eastern Rehe and Inner Mongolia, and it controls the transportation hub inside and outside the pass. It has been an important military garrison since ancient times.
    Since the Japanese imperialists invaded Northeast China, it has been determined as the political and economic center of western Liaoning, actively operating it, and designated it as the capital of the puppet Jinzhou Province. Because of its proximity to the Fuxin and Beipiao coal mines, fuel supply is convenient; Huludao, 126 li southwest, is also a good harbor, and export transportation is extremely convenient. Therefore, various light and heavy industries were built in Jinzhou on a large scale. Within a few years, the population increased sharply, reaching 150,000 by the time of Japan's surrender, becoming a major emerging city. During the Japanese puppet rule, the industry there included airplanes, tanks, papermaking, leather making, flour, textiles, tobacco, wool weaving, tung oil, glass, and more.
    After Japan's surrender, Jinzhou was first recovered by the People's Liberation Army, which persisted in the war of resistance on the border of Rehe and Liaoning. In the winter of that year, it was occupied by the Kuomintang army. During last winter's offensive, the People's Liberation Army cut off the Beining Road between Jinzhou and Xinmin, and Shenyang and Changchun were besieged. The Kuomintang bandits rushed to transfer Fan Hanjie's army to Jinzhou to establish the "Northeast Suppression General Headquarters Forward Command Post" as the center for liaison between the bandit troops inside and outside the pass, and developed the city into a large-scale supply base. All the grain, ordnance, ammunition, clothing, gasoline, and even soldiers supplied to the Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast were mostly shipped from Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places to Huludao by sea, and then transported to Jinzhou by truck or train. The Kuomintang also used Jinzhou as the terminal for railway and general air transportation outside the pass. After materials and personnel were concentrated in Jinzhou, they were airlifted to Shenyang and Changchun by transport aircraft. There is a huge airport in the northwest suburb of Jinzhou, which can accommodate multiple transport aircraft for take-off and landing. Each airlift flight from Jinzhou to Shenyang can transport 61 tons, while direct flights from Pingjin to Shenyang can only transport 4.7 tons. Each plane can make six round trips from Jinzhou to Shenyang every day, while from Pingjin to Shenyang it cannot exceed three times.
    Therefore, the Kuomintang High Command attached great importance to Jinzhou. Before the People's Liberation Army attacked Jinzhou this time, Chiang Kai-shek personally went to Jinzhou on the 3rd of this month to deploy. On the 14th, when the siege began, Wei Lihuang flew to Jinzhou to command from the air. However, the People's Liberation Army completely captured the famous city defended by 100,000 troops in only 31 hours.
    The liberation of Jinzhou is not only the greatest victory of the People's Liberation Army on the Northeast battlefield, but also finally closed the only passage for the Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast to escape from the sea, land and air to the interior, and cut off the important supply source of the Chiang bandits in Changchun and Shenyang, making the Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast like turtles in a jar, with no choice but to lay down their weapons and wait to be annihilated.

　　锦州介绍
    锦州是东北的工业城市，重要的铁路交叉点，又是东北蒋匪最大的供应基地与重要的战略据点。
    锦州位于辽西走廊的东北端，小凌河的下游西岸，北面依托热辽边境的松岭山余脉，南面滨临小凌河口的沿海平原，地势北高南低，市周为丘陵地带所环绕。地当北宁铁路关外段中央偏南，东北距沈阳约五百里，西南距山海关约四百里。往北有铁路通义县，西折可至北票、承德，是为锦承铁路。由义县向东北，则可经新义铁路至阜新及新立屯，北接大（虎山）通（辽）路直达北满。素为热东蒙满商业集中市场，且握关内外交通咽喉，古来即为屯兵重地。
    自日本帝国主义侵我东北，即确定为辽西政治经济中心，积极经营，定为伪锦州省之省会。并因其接近阜新、北票两煤矿，燃料供应便利；其西南一百二十六里之葫芦岛，又为一优良海港，出口运输亦极为便捷，遂在锦州大事兴办各种轻重工业。数年之间，人口骤增，迄日本投降时已达十五万人，成为一大新兴都市。在日伪统治时，该地工业即有飞机、坦克、制纸、制革、面粉、纺织、烟草、毛织、桐油、玻璃等多种。
    日本投降后，锦州首为在热辽边坚持抗战之解放军所光复，是年冬被国民党军侵占。去年冬季攻势，解放军在锦州与新民间截断北宁路、沈阳、长春被围困，蒋匪遂赶调范汉杰兵团驻守锦州，成立“东北剿总前进指挥所”，以作为关内外匪军联络之中心站，并将该城发展为一规模巨大之供应基地。所有供给东北蒋匪之粮食、军械、弹药、被服、汽油，以至兵员，大部由上海、青岛、天津等地海运至葫芦岛，然后以卡车或火车载运至锦州。国民党对关外之铁路与一般空中运输，亦皆以锦州为终点。物资与人员在锦州集中后，方以运输机空运沈阳、长春。锦州西北郊有巨大之飞机场，可容多架运输机起落。空运飞机自锦州至沈阳每次能运六十一吨，而自平津直接飞沈则只能运四点七吨。自锦至沈每机每日能来回六次，而自平津至沈则不能超过三次。
    因此，国民党统帅部对锦州极为重视。此次解放军进攻锦州前夕，蒋介石曾于本月三日亲至锦州部署。十四日攻城战开始，卫立煌又飞至锦州上空指挥。但解放军仅历卅一小时即将有十万大军坚守的名城完全攻克。
    锦州的解放，不仅是解放军在东北战场上最大的伟大胜利，且最后封闭了东北蒋匪由海陆空向关内逃跑之唯一通路，截断了长、沈蒋匪的重要供应来源，使东北蒋匪有如瓷中之鳖，除了放下武器就只有等候被歼。
