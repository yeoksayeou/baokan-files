[Jizhong Electric] Since the autumn, the People's Liberation Army and the vast local armed forces and militias in the Pingjinbao triangle area have conducted victorious operations to protect the autumn harvest. From the end of August to early October, in a month and a half, a total of 4,148 enemies were eliminated. The Kuomintang bandit army's conspiracy to loot grain has been completely crushed. As of October 11, the vast area north of the Daqing River, east of the Pingbao Railway from Xuqiao River to Songlindian (approximately 140 li), south of the Yongding River, and west of Shengfang, including Rongcheng, Xiongxian, Baxian, Xinzhen, and the county towns of Yongqing, Guan, Xincheng, and Dingxing, is completely under our control; the enemy has been compressed into isolated strongholds such as north of the Yongding River, north of Zhuoxian, and Baoding, Shengfang, and Anci.

Before the autumn harvest began, the Kuomintang bandit army, in order to plunder grain in our area on a large scale and disrupt the peasants' autumn harvest, Jiang bandit's New Second Army Thirty-second Division and local bandits gathered hundreds of carts, divided the area around Baoding into three autumn-grabbing zones, and planned to set up temporary strongholds. Jiang bandits from Wang Qingzhai and other places in western Tianjin brought carts and sickles to grab the autumn harvest, cutting and seizing any ripe autumn fields. Eight bandit "great villages" such as Tang'erli in Baxian County jointly grabbed the autumn harvest. Bandit troops and puppet "great villages" alike extensively kidnapped people and seized cattle, forcing the people to redeem themselves with grain. Puppet county governments also established various pretexts to carry out extortion. Wang bandit Fenggang's First and Second Brigades and the puppet Qinghe Detachment north of the Daqing River were also preparing to make trouble. Our People's Liberation Army and local armed forces and militias bravely launched attacks to smash the autumn-grabbing conspiracy of the Jiang bandits, striking the autumn-grabbing bandit troops everywhere. On the Beining front and north of the Daqing River, part of our local armed forces successively attacked Jiang bandits near Banzhuang, Dawang Village, and Baigou in Rongding County on September 10, 11, 13, 15, and 17, eliminating more than 130 enemies in total. On the 17th, part of our local troops surrounded and raided Wang bandit's Second Brigade west of Niutuo (40 li north of Baxian), forcing the enemy to flee in panic towards Guan. On the morning of the 19th, part of our army launched an attack on Guan County, 120 li south of Beiping. After five hours of fierce fighting, the entire city was occupied. 313 defending enemies were wiped out. On the 20th, Jiang bandit's 94th Army 121st Division rushed from Beiping, and on the morning of the 21st, it fled towards Guan. In order to carry out mobile operations to protect the autumn harvest, our army took the initiative to evacuate the city. Wang bandit Fenggang, in order to retaliate and loot a large amount of grain, concentrated more than 3,000 men from the First Brigade and the Qinghe Detachment and departed from Xincheng, advancing to the Banjiawo area southeast of Xincheng on September 28. Our army surrounded the enemy on the morning of October 3 and fought fiercely for ten hours, wiping out most of the enemy, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 2,100 enemies, with only a few hundred remaining escaping. On the 4th, Wang bandit's Second Brigade, defending Guan, fled in a panic to Yufa north of the Yongding River. By this point, Wang bandit Fenggang's grain-grabbing conspiracy had failed, and the vast area north of the Daqing River was recovered by us.

Around Baoding and along the Pingbao line, our local armed militias are also actively operating. In the six days from October 9th to 14th, our army successively recovered Xushui, Gucheng, Xincheng, Dingxing, Gaobeidian, and Songlindian, and continuously attacked strongholds such as Doudian Xihe east of Zhuoxian and Liulihe and Yongle Station, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 400 bandits. Our army pressed directly on Zhuoxian, controlling approximately 120 li of the Pingbao Road from Xuhe Bridge to Songlindian, making Jiang bandits in Baoding even more isolated and panicked. At the same time, the militias in the border areas of Qingyuan, Anxin and other counties are also actively attacking the grain-grabbing enemies. The militias in a certain district of Qingyuan alone have killed, wounded and captured 54 enemies in recent days. Around Tianjin, our army has also launched continuous attacks, and also captured the Shigu stronghold more than 90 li southwest of Tianjin, capturing more than 50 enemies. On the 30th, a certain unit of our army in southern Tianjin defeated a battalion of Jiang bandits from Wumeichengzi (southern Tianjin), eliminating more than 60 enemies.

In total, in a month and a half, our People's Liberation Army, local armed forces, and militias have not only eliminated more than 4,000 enemies, but also seized 2,231 rifles and pistols, 64 light machine guns, 10 heavy machine guns, 4 mortars, 14 60mm mortars, 10 grenade launchers, 25 submachine guns, more than 160,000 rounds of ammunition, and 1,016 artillery shells.

Looking at the situation in the Pingjinbao triangle area, it has undergone major changes since August of last year. After August of last year, the Jiang Fu bandit gang used forces of more than one army to support Wang bandit Fenggang in carrying out a cruel "mopping-up" operation in the triangle area. At that time, Wang bandit built hundreds of bunkers along the Juma River, the Daqing River, and the Pinghan Railway. However, since our army switched to the offensive in December of last year, it has successively recovered Xiong, Baxian counties and vast areas, completely crushing Wang bandit's "control of the surface." Wang bandit's bunker policy suffered a disastrous defeat, forcing Wang bandit to become a roving bandit. The shameless Wang bandit Fenggang boasted of his disastrous defeat as a "flexible" tactic of "avoiding the large with the small," clamoring for a "roving suppression of the surface." But the development of the facts gave Wang bandit a slap in the face. Wang bandit's "avoiding the large with the small" did not escape the fate of being continuously wiped out. The result will be the same as other Jiang bandits, unable to escape the fate of being completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army.

　　平津保我地武民兵奋战月余
  　胜利护秋歼敌四千
  　王匪凤岗抢粮失败我军收复广大地区
    【冀中电】平、津、保三角地区解放军及广大地武民兵，入秋以来，进行了胜利的护秋作战。自八月底到十月上旬，一个半月以来，共歼敌四千一百四十八名。国民党匪军的抢粮阴谋，已被彻底粉碎。截至十月十一日，大清河以北平保路徐桥河至松林店一线（约百四十里）以东，永定河以南，胜芳以西的广大地区，包括容城、雄县、霸县、新镇及永清、固安、新城、定兴等县城，已完全为我控制；敌人已被压缩至永定河北、涿县以北及保定、胜芳、安次等少数孤立据点中。
    秋收开始前，国民党匪军为大肆抢掠我区粮食，破坏农民秋收，保定蒋匪新二军三十二师及地方土匪，集结了数百辆大车，并将保定周围划成三个抢秋区，计划按设临时据点。津西王庆宅等地蒋匪，携带大车、镰刀出动抢秋，逢成熟秋田即抢割，霸县堂二里等八个匪大乡并实行联合抢秋，匪军与伪大乡均大肆绑人拉牛，强迫人民以粮食赎取。各伪县府亦巧立名目，实行勒索。大清河北王匪凤岗之一、二两旅及伪清河支队，亦准备蠢动。我解放军及地武民兵，为粉碎蒋匪抢秋阴谋，英勇出击，到处打击抢秋匪军。在北宁沿线及大清河北我地方武装一部，于九月十、十一、十三、十五、十七日，连续袭击北宁路附近之畔庄、大王村、容定县之百沟等地蒋匪，先后歼敌百卅余名。十七日，我地方兵围一部，奔袭牛驼（霸县以北四十里）以西王匪之第二旅，迫敌狼狈窜向固安。十九日晨，我军一部继向北平南一百二十里之固安县城发动进攻。经五小时激战，全部占领该城。守敌被歼三百一十三名。二十日，蒋匪九十四军一二一师仓慌从北平赶来，二十一日晨向固安窜犯。我军为机动进行护秋作战，乃主动撤离该城。王匪凤岗为出动报复，并大量抢掠粮食，集中了第一旅及清河支队三千余人，从新城出动，九月廿八日进至新城东南之板家窝一带。我军于十月三日晨向该敌实行包围，激战十小时，当将该敌大部歼灭，毙伤俘敌二千一百余，残敌仅数百名逃窜。四日，固安守敌王匪第二旅向永定河北之榆垡狼狈逃窜。至此，王匪凤岗之抢粮阴谋即已告失败，大清河北广大地区为我收复。
    在保定外围，及平保沿线我地方武装民兵亦积极活动。十月九日至十四日六日中，我军又连续收复徐水、固城、新城、定兴、高碑店、松林店，并连续袭击涿县、琉璃河以东窦店西河等据点及永乐车站，毙伤俘匪四百余名。我军直逼涿县，控制平保路徐河桥至松林店段约百二十华里，使保定蒋匪更形孤立与恐慌。与此同时，清苑、安新等县边沿区民兵亦积极打击抢粮敌人，仅清苑某区民兵，日来即毙伤俘敌五十四名。在天津外围我军也连续出击，又攻克津西南九十余里之石沟据点，俘敌五十余。三十日，津南我军某部击溃由五美城子（津南）出扰之蒋匪一个营，歼敌六十余。
    总计一个半月来，我解放军、地武、民兵除歼敌四千余名外，缴获长短枪二千二百三十一支、轻机枪六十四挺、重机枪十挺、迫击炮四门、六零炮十四门、掷弹筒十个、冲锋枪二十五支、子弹十六万余发、炮弹一零一六发。
    综观平、津、保三角地区形势，自去年八月迄今，已起了重大变化，去年八月以后，蒋傅匪帮曾以一个军以上的兵力，扶植王匪凤岗对三角地区举行了残酷的“扫荡”，当时王匪沿拒马河、大清河、平汉路筑起了数百座碉堡。但自去年十二月我军转入主动后，先后收复了雄、霸县城及广大地区，彻底粉碎了王匪“面的控制”，王匪碉堡政策遭到惨败，迫使王匪变为流寇式的窜扰。毫不知耻的王匪凤岗却把他的惨败吹嘘为“以小避大”的“灵活”战术，叫嚣什么“游剿制面”。但事实的发展，给了王匪一个耳光，王匪的“以小避大”没逃脱连续被歼的命运。其结果将和其他蒋匪一样，逃脱不了被解放军完全歼灭的命运。
