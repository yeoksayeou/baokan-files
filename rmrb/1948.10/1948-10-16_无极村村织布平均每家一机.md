[Jizhong Telegram] Under the support of the democratic government, the cloth industry in Guozhuang of Wuji County and the textile industry in the entire county are developing rapidly. The county has a foundation in textiles; out of the 183 villages in the county, 104 weave Guozhuang cloth. Guozhuang cloth was originally created during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty by Zhang Shiqi of Zhang Duanhui Village through spinning, weaving and selling cloth, resulting in the famous "Guozhuang Shiqi Large Cloth." It is sold throughout North China, especially in areas like Yanbei, Suiyuan, Yangquan, and Fuping, where it has the widest market. In the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, there were nine cloth shops in Guozhuang Town alone, and villages within a radius of about thirty li wove Guozhuang cloth, generating substantial income, with the saying "one loom is as good as three mu of land" being popular. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, capitalist economics invaded the inland, and foreign yarns and cloths flooded the market, causing a period of decline in the textile industry in various villages. Later, they gradually switched to weaving foreign yarn cloth, and were still able to sell well due to their existing foundation. After the July 7th Incident, due to the blockade and extortion by the Japanese invaders, some cloth shops closed down, and textile production in most villages ceased. After the Japanese surrender, the Party and government organs of the county, in order to help the masses restore the textile industry, held various meetings in the villages around Guozhuang, implemented the Party's policies, the cooperative formed a cloth receiving station, and specifically helped textile households in various villages solve difficulties, such as promoting textile tools, providing loans and cotton, and manufacturing and promoting shuttle-pulling machines and accelerated spinning wheels. The Party committee and the government called on the masses to help each other in textile production. In the fourth and fifth districts alone, forty weaving groups were organized, with more than a thousand group members. Cloth industry cooperatives were also established in various villages. Last year, due to the increasingly wide sales of cloth, some merchants and peddlers counterfeited and faked the cloth, only seeking profit and not quality, which reduced the quality of Guozhuang cloth. The types, lengths, and widths of the cloth were also inconsistent. The weight of each piece of cloth was reduced by two or three liang, and the weaving was very poor. Bad cloth accounted for more than 69% of the market, and sales gradually declined. Later, the county began rectifying the villages. County and district cadres held various meetings with village branch committees, production team leaders, and others, calling on Party members to play exemplary roles. The cooperative also formulated rectification standards, which were distributed to various villages. Director Ji of the cooperative personally inspected the market and various households. After a year of rectification, the quality of the cloth improved. Good cloth accounted for more than 95% of the market. The price of cloth greatly increased, and sales gradually increased as well.

During the land reform, due to the lack of in-depth propaganda of the policies, and the infringement of individual ginning houses, as well as a lack of leadership, the production of the cloth industry decreased. After the correction of these errors in February and March of this year, and the return of the wrongly confiscated ginning houses, the morale of the masses stabilized, and the area of textile production expanded. The landlords and rich peasants who had not previously labored also participated in the textile industry. In Southwest Wang Village alone, 24 new looms were added, of which landlords and rich peasants accounted for 22. Since the abolition of the exchange and the implementation of free trading, the market has become even more active. In addition to the Yufeng Cloth Shop, three more cloth shops have been added. Daily sales are 200,000 bolts, and the supply of cloth cannot meet the demand. Because the quality of the cloth is good, thick, durable, and low in cost, sales are even wider. Under the influence of the Guozhuang cloth industry, the textile industry in the entire county is also developing rapidly. According to statistics from 169 villages in the county, there are 13,327 spinning wheels and 7,629 looms, an average of one loom per household, and one spinning wheel per adult woman. After the land reform, Southwest Wang and two other villages added 82 new looms. Ma Village previously had only 19 looms, but now it has increased to 168. This year, the county suffered severe floods. In order to overcome the famine, the masses, in addition to busily planting wheat, always spun and wove until midnight.

Although the Guozhuang cloth industry in the county is developing rapidly, there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently: (1) Textile mutual aid groups have not been used to deliver cloth, causing trouble for both buyers and sellers, and wasting manpower. For example, when delivering cloth, every household crowds the courtyard with cloth, and the cloth collectors are also very busy. (2) After free trading, some merchants and cloth shops do not abide by policies and laws, and want to destroy the rectification, which will inevitably affect the development of the cloth industry if it continues. (3) Counterfeiting and faking still occur frequently. Some weave cloth using fake trademarks. Some also privately create brand names and trademarks without registering with the government, and the government has not stopped them in a timely manner. (4) The state-owned Yufeng Cloth Shop does not have close enough ties with local organs, and the masses are dissatisfied with the state-owned shop. Local cadres hear this and do not explain. These problems should attract the attention of the county's leading organs and be resolved as soon as possible.

### 无极村村织布平均每家一机

　　无极村村织布平均每家一机
    【冀中电】无极郭庄布业及全县纺织业，在民主政府扶植下日益发达。该县纺织有基础，全县共一百八十三村，织郭庄布的就有一百零四个村，郭庄布是在明代万历年间张段回村张世奇由纺织卖布创开的，到现在已留下有名的“郭庄世奇大布”；行销华北各省，特别雁北、绥远、阳泉、阜平等处，销路最广。民国十七八年，只郭庄镇上就有九个布庄，周围约三十里内村庄都织郭庄布，收入很大，流行着“一张机能顶三亩田”的说法。民国二十年后，资本主义的经济侵入内地，外来洋线洋布充斥市场，各村纺织业一度萧条，后又逐渐改织洋线布，借旧有基础还能畅销。七七事变后，由于日寇的封锁和勒索，一些布店倒闭，各村纺织大部停业。日寇投降后，该县党政机关为帮助群众恢复纺织业，在郭庄周围村庄召开了各种会议，贯彻党的政策，联社成立了收布庄，并具体帮助各村纺织户解决困难，如推销纺织用具，贷给款和棉花，制造和推销拉梭机及加速轮纺车。党委和政府，号召群众互助纺织。只四五区组织起来的就有四十个织布小组，一千多名组员。各村并成立布业合作社。去年因布业销路日广，有的商人小贩冒牌造假，只图赚钱，不求质量，使郭庄布质量降低，布的种类、长、宽也不一样。每个布份量减少二、三两，织的很次。市场上坏布占百分之六十九以上，销路逐渐下降。后该县开始整庄。县区干部在各村召开支委、生产组长等各种会议，号召党员起模范作用。联社也制定了整庄的尺丈，发到各村。联社季主任并亲自到集上及各家检查。经过一年的整庄，布的质量提高。市场的好布占百分之九十五以上。布价大为提高，销路也逐渐增多。
    土改中，由于宣传政策不深入，又侵犯了个别轧房，又缺乏领导，致布业生产降低。到今年二、三月后，经过纠偏，退回错斗的轧房后，群众情绪才稳定了，纺织面也扩大起来，过去不劳动的地富纷纷参加了纺织业。只西南汪一村即新添机子二十四张，其中地富就占二十二张。自取消交易所实行自由成交后，市场上更显活跃，除裕丰布店外，又增添了三个布店。日销二十万匹，所出布匹供不应求。因为布的质量好，厚实耐久，成本又低，所以销路更广了。在郭庄布业影响下，全县纺织业也日渐发达。据该县一百六十九个村统计，就有纺车一万三千三百二十七辆，机子七千六百二十九张，平均每家一张机子，成年妇女每人一辆纺车。土改后，西南汪等三村即增新机子八十二张。马村过去只十九张机子，现已增至一百六十八张。今年该县水灾严重，群众为渡过灾荒，除忙种麦子外，总是纺织到半夜。
    该县郭庄布业虽然迅速发展着，但还存在一些问题急待解决：（一）没有使用起纺织互助组送布交布，以致买卖双方麻烦，浪费人力。如交布时，每家都抱着布去挤满院子，收布的也很忙。（二）自由交易后，有的商贩布店不遵守政策法令，随便要破坏整庄，发展下去，必将影响布业发展。（三）造假冒牌仍发生的不少，有的织布用假商标冒。也有的没有到政府注册，就私自造牌号商标，政府也没及时制止。（四）公营裕丰布店和地方机关联系不够密切，群众对公营商店不满，地方干部听到也不解释；这些问题，应引起该县领导机关注意，并尽速研究解决。
