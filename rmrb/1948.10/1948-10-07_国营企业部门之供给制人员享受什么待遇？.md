　　What benefits do supply system personnel in state-owned enterprise departments enjoy?

　　To the Editor:
    The Taihang Xinhua Tobacco Branch Company is under the leadership of the North China People's Government's State-Owned Enterprise Department. It has a distribution office in Jincheng County, Taiyue District. According to a certificate from the Taihang Administrative Office, the local government no longer levies financial and grain burdens. However, because the certificate states "public-owned" instead of "state-owned," the local government still levies war service support grain (all management personnel of the company are on the supply system).
    In Comrade Bo Yibo's report at the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, only "public-owned" enterprises were mentioned, not "state-owned." What is the difference between state-owned and public-owned? Is this a regulation specific to Taiyue District, or is it the same for the North China Government? Also, Article 19 of the salary and wage tax regulations states: "After the promulgation of this law, all war service, taxation... in other regions shall be abolished." Does "war service" include land cultivation on behalf of military families?
    Luozhuang Village in the Second District of Ren County, in addition to implementing other clauses of the draft salary and wage income tax, still requires the worker Li Wenxue, who is working elsewhere, to cultivate land on behalf of military families (the worker is away and hires someone to substitute). Similar situations exist in individual counties in other regions. I hope this can be answered as a question.

    Answer: Regarding this issue, the North China People's Government Finance Department has replied as follows:
    Whether it is the former Jinji Lu Yu Border Region Trade Bureau or companies and factories under the leadership of the North China People's Government State-Owned Enterprise Department, they are all referred to as state-owned. Management personnel of state-owned enterprises, if on the supply system, should enjoy the same treatment as revolutionary cadres, be exempt from service (including participation in war and cultivating land for families of military personnel and martyrs), and agricultural burdens should be deducted from the household's tax exemption point. It is incorrect for the Jincheng County government to still levy war service grain. If the company's employees are hired and earn salaries, or if temporary workers earn wages, they should, like the masses, bear the burden of labor service and cultivate land on behalf of military and martyr families; however, to accommodate their work, labor grain can be commuted according to regulations.
    The draft salary and wage income tax regulations promulgated by the former Jinji Lu Yu Border Region (which has not yet been formally promulgated), Taihang has promulgated and implemented on a trial basis according to the actual situation in the region. Other administrative offices have not yet promulgated and implemented it. Ren County is under the jurisdiction of the Jinnan Administrative Office and should be handled in accordance with the single law regulations of that administrative office.

### 国营企业部门之供给制人员享受什么待遇？

专栏：询问与答覆

　　国营企业部门之供给制人员享受什么待遇？编辑同志：
    太行新华烟草分公司归华北人民政府国营企业部领导，在太岳区晋城县设有分销处，经太行行署证明，当地政府已不再征收财粮负担，但因证明上写的是“公营”未写“国营”字样，故当地政府仍要派征战勤支差米（公司的全体经营管理人员都是供给制待遇）。
    华北工商会议上薄一波同志的报告中，只讲到公营企业未提“国营”字句。国营和公营究有何区别？是太岳区这样规定呢？还是华北政府也是这样？还有薪给所得征税办法十九条称：本法颁布后，其它各区之战勤、征税……一律作废，所指“战勤”是否句括给军属代耕？
    任县二区罗庄村，除已执行了薪给所得税草案其它条款外，现仍叫在外的工人李文学给军属代耕（工人在外，家里雇人顶替）。其它区的个别县份也有类似情形，希望能当做一个问题给解答。

    答：关于这一问题已请华北人民政府财政部答复如下：
    无论前晋冀鲁豫边区贸易厅或由华北人民政府国营企业部领导的公司、工厂、分公司，均称为国营；国营企业的管理人员，如系供给制，应享受革命职员同等待遇，免服勤务（包括参战和代军烈属耕地），农业负担应在家扣除免税点。晋城县政府仍派勤务米是不对的。如公司职员系雇佣性质，赚得薪资，或工杂人员赚工资者应同群众一样，负担勤工及为军工属代耕；但为照顾其工作，可依规定折出勤米。
    前晋冀鲁豫边区颁发的薪给工资所得税草案（还未正式颁布），太行根据该区实际情形颁布试行，其他行署还未颁布试行。任县系冀南行署辖区，应依该行署单行法规定办理。
