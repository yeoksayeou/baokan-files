　　To Comrade Quan Xueyong of the Limin Factory in Shijiazhuang:
    The fact that a young woman, a martyr's family member from Xishanbaozhuang Village, Gaocheng, was bullied by Wang Xilong of her village, and the district chief ignored it when informed, is wrong. We have forwarded this matter to the Gaocheng County Government for them to handle. To Comrade Zhao Wei of the Xingtang Armed Forces Department:
    The issue of Wang Shizong not returning to the army after going home can be investigated by the Xingtang County leadership, and dealt with according to the specific circumstances. To Comrade Ma Luoye of Yunhe Middle School:
    If your ox was indeed bought with salary rice and has nothing to do with your family, and there is testimony from the entire village, then it should not be confiscated. The district cadre's statement that "savings should be handed over to the public" is incorrect. If it has already been distributed, appropriate compensation can be made. To the Dingxian Zhuanlu Industrial and Commercial Administration Office:
    Regarding how to handle the property of landlords and rich peasants from other villages in Zhuanlu Village, because the description in the letter is too simple, we cannot provide specific opinions and have forwarded it to the Dingxian County Committee for handling. To Comrade Ye Lian of Shijiazhuang:
    A flour mill and beehives are both household side businesses and should not be confiscated. To Comrade Liu Yinzeng of the Seventh District of Xingtang:
    Since your brother sacrificed himself during a breakthrough in the War of Resistance Against Japan, your family should of course be considered a martyr's family and should enjoy the treatment of a martyr's family. To Comrades Qiao Wanzhong of Guantao and Zhang Fenglin of Xingtang:
    The letters are not detailed enough and cannot be answered.
