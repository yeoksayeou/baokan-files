　　Ugly Diplomatic Embarrassment of U.S. Imperialism
　　Truman Planned to Negotiate with the Soviet Union Alone, Marshall Panicked and Returned from Paris to Prevent It
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th – Various reports: Just as the activities of the American representatives at the United Nations were in a state of stalemate, according to U.S. official sources, Truman in Washington had planned to send Supreme Court Chief Justice Vinson to the Soviet Union as a special envoy to discuss resolving the differences between the two countries on the Berlin issue and the issue of atomic energy. Marshall, who was far away in Paris, strongly opposed this plan upon learning of it. Marshall flew back to Washington from Paris by plane on the evening of the 8th. On the morning and afternoon of the 9th, he met with Truman twice. When Truman received reporters after the meeting, he said that he had abandoned his original plan. In explaining his reasons for opposition, Marshall stated that if the United States took unilateral action to resolve the Berlin issue, there would be a risk of misunderstanding among Western countries, and this risk is particularly significant at present because it could undermine the unity among Western countries. In Paris, the delegations of Western countries attending the United Nations General Assembly were all frightened and at a loss upon hearing of this matter. In his speech, Marshall also admitted that the United Nations delegation was agitated by this incident, and stated that the announcement of this incident had created confusion. This ugly scene in Washington shows the embarrassing situation of U.S. imperialism being caught in a dilemma on the issue of its policy towards the Soviet Union.
　　In addition: The notorious U.S. representative to the United Nations General Assembly and Dewey's foreign policy advisor Dulles also recently returned to the country and discussed the international situation with Dewey on the 5th.

　　美帝外交狼狈丑相
  　杜鲁门曾计划单独与苏谈判马歇尔惊慌从巴黎回美阻止
    【新华社陕北十三日电】各方报导：当美国代表在联大的活动陷于进退维谷之际，据美官方消息证实：在华盛顿的杜鲁门，曾计划派遣美最高法院院长文森以特使衔赴苏，商谈解决两国间关于柏林问题及原子能问题的分歧。远在巴黎的马歇尔知悉此计划后，力加反对。马歇尔已于八日晚自巴黎乘机飞返华盛顿。九日上午及下午，他曾先后与杜鲁门会谈二次。杜鲁门于会谈后招待记者时说，他已放弃原来的计划。马歇尔在解释其反对理由时称，美国若单独采取行动以求解决柏林问题，则西方国家间有发生误会之危险，此种危险，由于可能破坏西方国家间之团结，目前关系尤大。在巴黎，西方国家出席联大的代表团在闻悉此事后，莫不惊恐失措。马歇尔在其谈话中亦承认，联合国代表团都为这一事件所激动，并称这一事件的公布，已使事态混乱。华盛顿方面发生的这出丑剧，显示美帝国主义内部在对苏政策问题上进退维谷的狼狈相。
    又讯：臭名远扬的美出席联大代表、杜威之外交政策顾问杜勒斯最近亦曾返国，并于五日与杜威商谈国际局势。
