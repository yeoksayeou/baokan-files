　　The Current Situation of the Autumn Offensive
    The People's Liberation Army's 1948 Autumn Offensive is developing on an unprecedented scale and at an unprecedented speed. From September 12th to October 24th, in just 43 days, it has liberated important cities such as Jinan, Jinzhou, Yantai, Changchun, Zhengzhou, Baotou, and Kaifeng; captured alive Wang Yaowu and Fan Hanjie, "first-class" generals under Chiang Kai-shek; prompted the uprising of two armies, Wu Huawen and Zeng Zesheng, and several other enemy troops, as well as the collective surrender of Zheng Dongguo and his New 7th Army. Within 43 days, the Chiang bandit army was annihilated, including those killed, wounded, captured, and those who revolted or surrendered, according to incomplete statistics, approximately 350,000. Even greater victories lie ahead.

    (1)
    The first major victory of the Autumn Offensive was the liberation of Jinan. Jinan has a population of 700,000, a garrison of about 100,000 regular and irregular troops totaling fourteen divisions (brigades) commanded by Wang Yaowu, military supplies accumulated over a long period provided by American imperialism, a terrain surrounded by rivers and mountains that is easy to defend and difficult to attack, and solid defensive works that have been continuously built over the years. It, along with Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Taiyuan, is one of the pillars supporting Chiang Kai-shek's remaining power in North China today, and the most important fortress of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Shandong.

    Chiang Kai-shek was determined to hold Jinan. In addition to ordering Wang Yaowu to defend Jinan to the death, before our army began its attack on September 16th, he personally discussed a plan with Wang Yaowu in Nanjing to send reinforcements of three army corps and twenty-three divisions (brigades), approximately 170,000 bandit troops, from the Xuzhou area. These troops began to assemble one after another starting from September 17th. With the 100,000 troops defending Jinan plus 170,000 reinforcements, Chiang Kai-shek "arranged" a "battle plan" involving 270,000 men.

    However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which is nearing its end, is decaying in every aspect. The 100,000 bandit troops inside Jinan city, and all the mountains, deep trenches, outer walls, inner stockades, high blockhouses, and low forts they relied on, could not withstand the blow of the People's Liberation Army's iron fist. General Wu Huawen led his troops in an uprising on September 19th, the third day of our attack on Jinan. Wang Yaowu disguised himself and tried to escape after we entered the inner city on the 24th but was captured by us. The 150,000 reinforcement bandit troops preparing to move north from Xuzhou had not even started to move when Jinan was liberated.

    Under the shock of the fall of Jinan, the remaining enemy forces in Shandong successively abandoned Heze, Linyi, and Yantai. Now, except for Qingdao and a few strongholds along the edge of southern Shandong, all of Shandong has been liberated. During this period, our army in northern Jiangsu liberated Dongtai.

    The second and third major victories of the Autumn Offensive were in the Northeast.

    The Northeast People's Liberation Army's offensive was first directed at Jinzhou. Before September, Chiang Kai-shek had a total of forty-three regular divisions and more than forty thousand irregular troops in Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou. Jinzhou was the supply station for the enemy troops in Changchun and Shenyang and the land and water throat connecting the rear. Therefore, he stationed fifteen divisions, approximately 120,000 men, in Jinzhou and its surrounding areas. These fifteen divisions were centered on Jinzhou, extending along the Beining Railway from Yixian to Shanhaiguan, and five divisions, approximately 40,000 men, from Fu Zuoyi's system between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan inside the pass cooperated with them. The two totaled twenty divisions, approximately 160,000 men.

    The twenty days from September 12th to October 1st were the preparatory stage for the attack on Jinzhou. Our army successively captured Changli (later evacuated), Xingcheng, Suizhong, and Yixian, and cut off the traffic between Jinzhou and Jinxi in the Gaoqiao and Tashan areas, completing the plan to isolate Jinzhou.

    Chiang Kai-shek flew to Peiping in a hurry on September 30th and flew to Shenyang on October 2nd to personally deploy military aid to Jinzhou. In his deployment: 1. Draw five divisions from Fu Zuoyi's system and transport them by sea to Jinxi, uniting with the original four divisions in Jinxi to form nine divisions with approximately 90,000 men to directly aid Jinzhou, which was only eighty miles away. The two divisions of nearly 20,000 men withdrawn from Yantai were also rushed to Huludao, but Jinzhou had already been liberated by us when they arrived. 2. Transfer the main force of five armies, twelve divisions, and three cavalry brigades, approximately 120,000 men, from Shenyang to Xinmin, Zhangwu, and Xinlitun, attempting to cut off the railway traffic behind our Jinzhou attacking troops, relieve the siege of Jinzhou, and at the same time cooperate with the retreat of Changchun. 3. Order Zheng Dongguo's six divisions in Changchun to break through, avoiding being annihilated.

    But Chiang Kai-shek's plan failed again. On October 9th, our army began to attack the outskirts of Jinzhou, and on the 14th, it launched an attack on the city. After only thirty-one hours of fierce fighting, it occupied this "permanently fortified" city that the Kuomintang had been operating for more than a year, annihilated all seven divisions and other troops defending the city, and captured Fan Hanjie alive. The so-called Jinxi reinforcements, although they used five divisions to attack the Gaoqiao Tashan area fiercely on the 14th when Jinzhou was in the most critical situation, were beaten back under the resolute resistance of our blocking troops. Now, the eleven divisions of enemy troops in the Jinxi and Huludao areas are trapped in the narrow beachhead between Jinxi and Huludao, in a dangerous position of fighting with their backs to the sea. As for the enemy troops who went west from Shenyang, they were still only hovering around Zhangwu and Xinlitun when Jinzhou fell. The enemy troops in Changchun did not dare to break through when Jinzhou fell.

    When our army launched a general attack on Jinzhou on the 14th, Chiang Kai-shek fled from Nanjing to Shenyang that night. It is said that when Chiang Kai-shek flew to Shenyang on October 2nd, he said to his senior generals: If Jinzhou is not defended, I swear I will never see you again. But on the 15th, he had to sit in Shenyang and watch Jinzhou fall. In a panic, he ordered Zheng Dongguo to break through from Changchun immediately, but the enemy troops in Changchun had already accepted the lessons of Jinan and Jinzhou, and already knew the two different paths of Wu Huawen and Wang Yaowu Fan Hanjie, they no longer acted according to Chiang Kai-shek's orders. On the 17th, General Zeng Zesheng, commander of the 60th Army, led 30,000 troops of the 60th Army in an uprising, and on the 19th, Zheng Dongguo, deputy commander-in-chief of the Chiang bandit's direct line Northeast "Suppression Headquarters" and commander of the First Army Corps, led the three divisions of the New 7th Army and other departments to surrender. Since then, the main force of the Chiang army in the Shenyang area has been in a position to be attacked by our army from both sides.

    As of the time of publication, the Liao Yaoxiang Army Corps of five armies and twelve divisions, which had advanced westward from Shenyang to the Black Mountain, Beizhen, and Dahushan areas of western Liaoning, has been surrounded and defeated by our army, capturing tens of thousands of enemies. The Northeast People's Liberation Army is now launching a full-scale offensive, fighting to annihilate all the Chiang army in the Northeast.

    (3)
    The focus of the North China People's Liberation Army's offensive is twofold: one is on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, and the other is on Taiyuan. The Peiping-Suiyuan Railway offensive destroyed Fu Zuoyi's long snake formation, controlled most of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, and liberated most of Suiyuan and Chahar. The Taiyuan offensive is completing the preparations for attacking the city.

    When our Autumn Offensive began, Fu Bandit Zuoyi had a total of eleven armies and forty divisions, mainly distributed between Tangshan, Tianjin, Peiping, Baoding, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou. His rear in Suiyuan and Chahar could generally maintain a relatively complete rule. The entire Peiping-Zhangjiakou line could still be open to traffic. In the past, when attacked by us, he could still use his relatively convenient transportation conditions to withdraw most of his troops and implement his so-called "mobile defense." But after our army's Autumn Offensive, these situations of Fu Bandit began to change. In early September, a part of the North China Liberation Army actively operated in the area north of Peiping, attracting Fu Bandit's four main armies, while another part of the Liberation Army launched an offensive on the western section of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway on September 24th, capturing Jining, Fengzhen, Liangcheng, Helin, and Qingshuihe in several days, isolating Datong and completely losing contact between Guihua, Baotou, and Fu Zuoyi's main force.

    After Fu Zuoyi discovered that our army was advancing westward, he immediately transferred his two main armies and other troops in the northern Peiping area, totaling nine divisions, approximately 50,000 men, to aid Suiyuan in the west, and reoccupied Jining on September 30th, which our army had temporarily evacuated.

    Taking advantage of the fact that Fu Bandit's direct line main force, the 35th Army and the Provisional 4th Army, were aiding Suiyuan in the west, our army in northern Peiping launched an offensive on the eastern section of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway on September 26th, successively capturing Chongli, Shangyi, Zhanyuan, Shangdu in northern Chahar, and Zhao Chuanbao east of Xuanhua within a week. Since October 9th, it has cut off the Peiping-Zhangjiakou Road in several places between Peiping and Xuanhua, directly threatening Zhangjiakou. Our army's offensive in Chahar forced Fu Bandit to abandon his plan to aid Suiyuan, and began to rescue Zhangyuan on October 4th, and shrank most of his troops on the Peiping-Zhangjiakou line. Our army in Suiyuan took advantage of the situation to recapture Jining on October 8th, and continued to capture Xinghe, Taolin, Wuchuan, Tuoketuo, and Saxian. On the 23rd, our army advancing into western Suiyuan continued to penetrate into Fu Bandit's lair, liberating Baotou, the second largest city in Suiyuan, making Guihua completely isolated.

    During this period, our army on the Peiping-Baoding front successively captured Xushui, Dingxing, Guan, and Xincheng between October 9th and 14th, and our army in southern Chahar attacked and occupied Zhuolu on the 19th.

    This action of the North China Liberation Army played a coordinating role in the Liaoxi Campaign of the Northeast Liberation Army, preventing Chiang Kai-shek from drawing more troops from Fu Zuoyi's system to reinforce the Northeast. Now Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi are at their wit's end, and are sending their 94th Army and several cavalry units, using the so-called heart-attacking tactics, southward along the Peiping-Hankou Line, attempting to offend the Shijiazhuang area, hoping to mobilize our army to return to aid, relieve their crisis on the Peiping-Suiyuan Line, and externally promote "major victories" to stimulate their declining morale. But our army is prepared and will only see its efforts come to nothing.

    The Battle of Taiyuan, which began on October 5th, is gradually approaching the city walls. Yan Xishan has fourteen division designations in Taiyuan, along with various miscellaneous units, claiming to have more than 90,000 men. This includes more than 10,000 reinforcements airlifted from Xi'an. On the 5th and 6th, our army first annihilated two divisions south of Taiyuan, totaling more than 7,000 men. By the 13th, it had cleared many strongholds in the south, southeast, and northeast of the city. Of particular importance was the capture of the main airport in Wusu, southeast of Taiyuan, and the control of the small airport in Wangcun, south of the city. Since the 15th, our army began to attack the blockhouses. By the 19th, our army had largely occupied the Taiyuan East Mountain highlands, and the Taiyuan North Airport was under artillery control. Our army is now clearing the blockhouse groups outside Taiyuan City and will soon be able to approach the city walls.

    (4)
    The Northwest Liberation Army conducted two victorious operations in central Shaanxi within eight days from October 6th to 13th, giving a heavy blow to Hu Zongnan's only mobile force and completely breaking Hu Zongnan's subsequent possibility of dividing his troops to aid the Central Plains or Taiyuan.

    Before this campaign, Hu Zongnan had ten armies and twenty-six divisions (brigades) in central Shaanxi, of which, in addition to the main force defending, the forces that could be mobilized for combat were five armies and fourteen divisions. In accordance with the policy of continuing to eliminate the living forces of the Hu bandits, the Northwest Liberation Army first launched an offensive on October 6th against two armies (reorganized divisions) of the Hu bandits east of the Luo River and north of Dali, annihilating most of the two armies and four divisions, totaling more than 16,000, within two days. In order to defend the gateway to Xi'an, the Hu bandits transferred ten more divisions (reorganized brigades) and squeezed them into a group, and once again went out of Luodong. From the 11th to the 13th, our army divided and surrounded one of the armies north of Dali, annihilating more than 7,000 people. Both battles achieved victory by annihilating the enemy in a very short period of time, and won the uprising of 1,000 people from the Chaoyi police team north of Tongguan. Hu Zongnan's possible mobile force has been severely hit in these two battles, which has laid a good foundation for continuing to eliminate more enemies and further developing the situation in the Northwest.

    (5)
    In the Central Plains, the Autumn Offensive is beginning. The enemy troops in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, due to the fall of Jinan and the threat of the East China Field Army to Xuzhou, Chiang Kai-shek was afraid that Xuzhou would become the second Jinan, so he directed Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, Huang Baitao, and Sun Yuanliang, the four army corps under Liu Zhi, as well as Feng Zhi'an and Liu Ruming, the two pacification districts, a total of twenty armies, forty-six divisions and approximately 350,000 men, to gather together centered on Xuzhou. After the Sun Yuanliang Army Corps was transferred east from Zhengzhou, the main force of the 40th Army was left in Zhengzhou. A part of our Central Plains Liberation Army attacked Zhengzhou on the 22nd, and the defending enemies abandoned the city and fled north, and were completely annihilated by us on the south bank of the Yellow River north of the city. Our army also recovered Zhongmou County, and then attacked Kaifeng. The enemy again abandoned the city and fled east, and our army liberated Kaifeng and Lanfeng to its east again on the 24th. So far, the three famous cities of Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Kaifeng in Henan Province have been liberated by our army. Under the influence of this victory, the defending enemies of Jiaozuo in northern Henan fled on the 24th, and the area has been occupied by the North China Liberation Army.

    During this period, our army in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu area liberated Shangcai, Fengtai, and Xiping. Our army in the Dabie Mountain area recovered Jinjiazai (Lihuang), Zhuwumiao (Yuexi), and Xinjidian (Fu). In the Jianghan and Tongbai areas, our army recovered Tianmen and Baokang.

　　秋季攻势现势
    人民解放军一九四八年的秋季攻势，正在以空前的规模和速度发展中。自九月十二日起至十月二十四日为止，仅四十三天，已解放了济南、锦州、烟台、长春、郑州、包头、开封等重要城市；活捉了王耀武、范汉杰这样蒋介石手下“第一等”的将军；促成了吴化文、曾泽生两个军及其他若干敌军的起义，和郑洞国率所部新七军的集体投降。四十三天之内蒋匪军被我消灭者包括毙伤俘与起义投降在内，据不完全的统计，约三十五万人。更大的胜利，还在前面。
    （一）
    秋季攻势的第一个大胜利是济南的解放。济南有七十万人口，有王耀武统率的正规与非正规军共十四个师（旅）约十万人的兵力，有美帝国主义接济的经过长期屯积的军火物资，有河山环抱易守难攻的地形，有多年来不断修筑的坚固防御工事。它与平、津、青岛、太原同是今天蒋介石撑持其华北残局的支柱，是蒋介石匪帮在山东最重要的堡垒。
    蒋介石是决心保持济南的。他除了命令王耀武死守济南外，在我军于九月十六日开始进攻之前，他在南京与王耀武当面商定了以徐州地区三个兵团二十三个师（旅）约十七万匪军增援的计划，这些部队均于九月十七日起先后开始集结。济南十万守军加上十七万援军，蒋介石“布置”了一个二十七万人的“会战计划”。
    但是，已接近末日的蒋介石匪帮，一切都在溃烂着。济南城内的十万匪军，和他们所依赖的一切崇山、深壕、外城、内寨、高碉、矮堡，全都经不起人民解放军铁拳的打击。吴化文将军在我攻济第三天即九月十九日率部起义。王耀武则于二十四日我攻入内城后化装逃跑，被我俘获。准备从徐州北上的十五万增援匪军，还未开动，济南即告解放。
    山东残敌在济南失守的震动之下，先后放弃了菏泽、临沂、烟台。现山东除青岛及鲁南边沿地带少数据点外，已全部解放。苏北我军，在此期间解放了东台。
    （二）
    秋季攻势第二个和第三个大胜利是在东北。
    东北我军的攻势，首先向着锦州。九月以前，蒋介石在长春、沈阳与锦州共有正规军四十三个师，连非正规军共有四十余万人。锦州是长沈敌军的补给站与接连后方的水陆咽喉。因此他在锦州及其外围地区驻有十五个师约十二万人。这十五个师以锦州为中心沿北宁路由义县摆到山海关，关内唐山至山海关间还有傅作义的五个师约四万人相策应。两者合计共二十个师，约计十六万余人。
    从九月十二日至十月一日这二十天内是攻锦的准备阶段，我军先后攻占昌黎（以后撤出）、兴城、绥中与义县，并在高桥塔山地区切断了锦州与锦西的交通，完成了孤立锦州的计划。
    蒋介石于九月三十日急飞北平，十月二日飞沈阳亲自部署援锦军事。他的部署中：一、从傅作义系统中抽五个师海运至锦西，会合锦西原来的四个师共九个师约九万人的兵力，直接援助相巨仅八十里的锦州。另由烟台撤退的两个师近两万人亦赶运葫芦岛，但到达时锦州早已被我解放了。二、由沈阳抽调主力五个军十二个师又三个骑兵旅约十二万人出新民、彰武、新立屯，企图以此切断我攻锦部队后方的铁路交通，图解锦州之围，同时策应长春的撤退。三、令长春郑洞国部六个师突围，避免被歼。
    但是蒋介石这一计划又破产了。十月九日我军开始攻击锦州外围，十四日发起攻城，只经过三十一小时的激战就占领了这座国民党经营了一年多的“永久设防”城市，全歼城内守敌七个师及其他部队，生擒范汉杰。所谓锦西的援军，虽然在十四日锦州最危急时，曾以五个师兵力猛攻高桥塔山地区，但在我阻援部队的坚决抗击下，都被打回去了。现在锦葫地区的十一个师敌军现正陷于锦西至葫芦岛间狭窄的滩头阵地上，处于背海作战的危险地位。至于由沈阳西出的敌军，锦州失守时还只徘徊于彰武新立屯一带。长春敌军至锦州失守时还不敢突围。
    十四日我军对锦州发起总攻时，蒋介石于当夜又由南京仓皇飞沈。据传，蒋介石在十月二日飞沈时，曾对他的高级将领说过：如果锦州不守，我誓不再见你们。但是他于十五日却不得不在沈阳坐视锦州的失陷。他在慌忙中下令郑洞国立即自长春突围，但是长春的敌军已经接受了济南与锦州的教训，已经知道了吴化文与王耀武范汉杰两种不同的出路，他们已不按蒋介石的命令行事了。十七日六十军军长曾泽生将军率六十军三万人起义，十九日蒋贼嫡系东北“剿总”副总司令兼第一兵团司令郑洞国率新七军三个师及其他各部投降。自此以后沈阳地区的蒋军主力就处于被我军夹击的境地。
    至发稿时止，由沈阳西进至辽西黑山、北镇、打虎山地区的廖耀湘兵团五个军十二个师，已被我军包围和击溃，俘敌数万。东北我军现正举行全线进攻，为歼灭东北全部蒋军而战。
    （三）
    华北我军攻势的重点有二：一在平绥线，一在太原。平绥线攻势摧毁了傅作义的长蛇阵，控制了平绥线大部，解放了绥远与察哈尔的大部地区。太原攻势则正在完成攻城的准备。
    傅匪作义在我秋季攻势开始时，共有十一个军四十个师，主要分布于唐山、天津、北平、保定、承德、张家口之间。他的绥远和察哈尔的后方，大体上远能保持比较完整的统治。平张全线尚可通车。过去在被我攻击时尚能利用其比较便利的交通条件，抽出其大部分的兵力，实行其所谓“机动防御”。但在我军秋季攻势以后，傅匪的这些情况就开始改变了。华北解放军一部于九月初在北平以北地区，积极活动，吸引着傅匪四个主力军，同时另部解放军则于九月二十四日起对平绥路西段分路发动攻势，数日之内连克集宁、丰镇、凉城、和林、清水河五城，使大同孤立，使归绥、包头与傅作义主力完全失去联系。
    傅作义发觉我军西进之后，立刻抽调其平北地区两个主力军及其他部队共九个师约五万人的兵力西援绥远，九月三十日重占我军暂时撤出的集宁。
    平北我军乘傅匪嫡系主力三十五军与暂四军西援之际，乃于九月二十六日对平绥铁路东段发起进攻，一周之内，先后攻克察北之崇礼、尚义、沾源、商都，和宣化以东之赵川堡。十月九日起，又在北平与宣化之间数处切断平张路，直接威胁张家口。我军在察哈尔的攻势，迫使傅匪放弃援绥计划，于十月四日开始回救张垣，并将其大部分兵力龟缩在于平张线上。绥远我军则乘势于十月八日再克集宁，续克兴和、陶林、武川、托克托、萨县。二十三日挺进绥西的我军继续深入傅匪巢穴，解放绥远第二大城包头，使归绥陷于完全的孤立。
    在此期间，平保前线我军在十月九日至十四日间先后攻克徐水、定兴、固安、新城四城，察南我军在十九日袭占涿鹿。
    华北解放军这一行动，对于东北解放军辽西战役起了配合作用，使蒋介石无法从傅作义系统中抽出更多的兵力去增援东北。现在蒋介石傅作义穷极无聊，正在派遣其第九十四军及若干骑兵，采用所谓攻心战术，沿平汉线南下，企图冒犯石家庄一带，以期调动我军回援，解救其平绥线的危机，并向外宣传“大捷”刺激其颓败军心。但是我军已有准备，将徒见其心劳日拙而已。
    太原之战，自十月五日开始，正逐步逼近城垣。阎锡山在太原共有十四个师番号，连同各种杂部，号称九万余人。其中包括有西安空运到来的增援部队一万余人。五、六两日我军首先歼灭太原南之两个师，共七千余人。至十三日止，又扫清城南方、东南方和东北方的据点多处，特别重要的是攻克了太原城东南武宿地方的主要机场，控制其城南王村的小机场。十五日起，我军开始攻碉作战。至十九日止，我军已大部占领太原东山高地，太原城北的飞机场已在炮火控制之下。我军现正肃清太原城外的碉堡群，不久即可迫近城垣。
    （四）
    西北解放军于十月六日至十三日八天之内，在陕中进行两次胜利的作战，给胡宗南仅有的机动兵力以沉重的打击，完全打破了胡宗南此后分兵援助中原或太原的可能。
    在此次战役前胡宗南在陕中的兵力尚有十个军二十六个师（旅），其中除大部守备外，能够调动作战的兵力为五个军、十四个师。西北解放军根据继续消灭胡匪有生力量的方针，六日首先对胡匪洛河以东大荔以北的两个军（整编师）发起进攻，两日之内歼敌两个军四个师的大部共一万六千余。胡匪为固守西安门户，再抽调十个师（整编旅）挤成一团，再出洛东，十一至十三日间我军又在大荔以北分割围攻其中之一个军，歼其七千余人。两役均以极短时期歼敌致胜，并争取了潼关以北的朝邑保警队一千人起义。胡宗南可能的机动兵力，在此两役中已受重大打击，这就为以后继续更多歼敌进一步开展西北战局，准备了好的基础。
    （五）
    中原方面，秋季攻势正在开始。陇海线东段的敌军因济南失守，华东野战军威迫徐州，蒋介石恐徐州成为济南第二，乃将刘峙指挥下的邱清泉、李＠、黄伯韬、孙元良四个兵团及冯治安、刘汝明两个绥区共二十个军四十六个师约三十五万人兵力，以徐州为中心相互靠拢，挤成一团。孙元良兵团由郑州东调后，在郑州留下第四十军主力。我中原解放军一部乃于二十二日进攻郑州，守敌弃城北逃，被我全部歼灭于城北黄河南岸。我军同时收复中牟县城，并随即进攻开封，敌又弃城东逃，我军于二十四日再度解放开封及其以东的兰封。至此，河南省内洛郑汴三大名城均为我军解放。在这个胜利的影响下，豫北的焦作守敌于二十四日逃跑，该地已被华北解放军占领。
    在此期间，豫皖苏区我军解放了上蔡、凤台、西平三城。大别山区我军收复了金家寨（立煌）、朱屋庙（岳西）、新集（扶）三城。在江汉和桐柏两区，我军收复了天门和保康。
