　　"Gold Yuan" Fails
    Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang's Plan to Plunder Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency
    Universally Resisted by the People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th] Reports from various sources indicate that the Kuomintang government's plan to plunder gold, silver, and foreign currency from the people has been resisted. The people in its controlled areas are largely unwilling to exchange their gold, silver, and foreign currency for the fake "Gold Yuan." At the beginning of the exchange, the Kuomintang government pretended to earnestly announce the daily exchange figures, but the actual situation was that "the number of people exchanging US dollars was less than the number exchanging silver dollars, and the number of people exchanging gold was even less than the number exchanging US dollars" (August 24th, Tianjin *Minguo Ribao*). The so-called "crowded gold and banknote exchangers" were actually "figures walking in and out of the front door of the bank (referring to the Kuomintang Central Bank) like a revolving lantern" (*Zhongjian* Magazine, Vol. 3, No. 7, Shanghai Communication). An Associated Press report on September 2nd on the exchange situation stated that the long lines in front of the bank had already disappeared. As of September 2nd, people had handed over gold, silver, and foreign currency worth approximately 30 million US dollars to exchange for a portion of Gold Yuan to meet their needs, while this was also "a gesture to show the government." By mid-September, there were even fewer people exchanging. The Central News Agency no longer announced exchange figures. Personnel from the fake Central Bank's Gold Exchange admitted, "In recent days, the large gold bars exchanged have decreased, and small gold ingots and gold jewelry rings are the majority" (September 14th, Tianjin *Dagong Bao*). At this time, Zhang Li-sheng and others, who were sitting and exploiting on behalf of the Four Big Families, also stepped up their means of deception, coercion, and intimidation, forcing various banks and firms to hand over gold, silver, and foreign exchange assets. The fake Deputy Minister of Finance, Xu Baiyuan, even made a special trip to Shanghai to "supervise" and claimed: "The government's redemption of gold, silver, and foreign currency will be completed by the end of this month (September) in accordance with regulations" (Central News Agency, September 13th). However, more than half a month later, the Kuomintang government announced on September 30th that the exchange of gold and banknotes would be extended for one month, and the exchange of silver would be extended for two months. This shows how the so-called currency reform has lost credibility in the eyes of the people and how it has been resisted.

### “金圆券”失灵  蒋匪掠夺金银外币计划  遭人民普遍抗拒

　　“金圆券”失灵
    蒋匪掠夺金银外币计划
    遭人民普遍抗拒
    【新华社陕北十日电】各方报导：国民党政府掠夺民间金银外币的计划遭到抗拒，其统治区人民多不愿将金银外币去兑换伪“金圆券”。在兑换当初，国民党政府象煞有介事的按日公布兑换数字，但实际情形是“兑换美钞的人比起兑换银元的要少，拿黄金去兑的又比兑换美钞的少”（八月二十四日天津民国日报）。所谓“拥挤不堪的金钞调换者”，原来即是“从该行（指国民党中央银行）的前门走进，从门走出的走马灯式的人物”（“中建”杂志三卷七期上海通讯）。九月二日美联社报导兑换情形称：银行门前的长列早已消失。至九月二日止，人们缴纳了约占三千万美元的金银外币兑换一部分金圆券以应需要，同时这也是“做给政府看的姿态”。到九月中旬，兑换的人更见稀少了。中央社已不再公布兑换数字。伪中央银行黄金兑换处的人员承认说：“近日来兑的黄金大条已较减少，以小黄鱼、饰金戒指等居多”（九月十四日天津大公报）。这时，为四大家族坐地搜刮的张厉生等人也加紧了欺哄吓诈的手段，勒逼各行庄缴出金银外汇资产。伪财次徐柏园还特地跑到上海“督导”，并声称：“政府收兑金银外币决依照规定本月（九月）底截止”（中央社九月十三日电）。然而，半个多月以后，国民党政府却于九月三十日宣布金钞兑换延期一月，白银兑换延期两月。这说明它的所谓改革币制在人民面前如何失尽信用，如何受到抗拒。
