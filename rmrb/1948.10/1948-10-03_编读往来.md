    Why are the figures for the area and population of the liberated areas different in "New Masses" and the People's Daily?

    Comrade Hu Quanxing of the Jize County Committee in Jinnan, Hebei, writes: -- I saw in the People's Daily, No. 48, page 2, "Great Development of Liberated Areas in the Second Year of the War of Liberation" and in the "New Masses," No. 44, page 2, "1.52 Million Enemies Eliminated in the Second Year of the War of Liberation," why are the population and area different? In the "New Masses" development table of the liberated areas, the population is: "131 million at the end of the first year of the War of Liberation, 37 million newly liberated in the second year, and a total of 168 million now." The area is: "8.8 million square li at the end of the first year of the War of Liberation, 620,000 square li liberated in the second year, and a total land area of 9.42 million square li now." The population published in the People's Daily is: "131 million at the end of the first year of the War of Liberation, 37 million at the end of the second year, and 168 million now." The area is: "2.2 million square kilometers at the end of the first year, 155,000 square kilometers at the end of the second year, and 2.355 million square kilometers now." Why is it different? Are square li and square kilometers different? How many square li equal one square kilometer? Where is the difference? What is the total population of China? The national population published in the People's Daily is 450 million. Is it 450 million or 450,000,000?

    Answer: -- "New Masses" is not wrong, and the People's Daily is not wrong either. The difference in the number of people is the difference between the general customary way of speaking and the strict scientific way of speaking. For example, the total population of China should be 450,000,000. The general customary way of speaking is 450 million, which is easy to misunderstand. The strict scientific way of speaking should be 450 million; or, according to the general way of speaking, it can also be read as 400 million and 50 million. The difference in the number of areas is because one is calculated in kilometers and the other is calculated in Chinese li. One kilometer is equal to two Chinese li, and one square kilometer is equal to four square li.
                                                                                                     (Editor)
    Is the difference in the title of the Polish Workers' Party resolution in the Shijiazhuang Daily and the People's Daily due to an error in one of them?

    Comrade Gu Yuan of the JiJin Middle School writes: -- The article "Resolution of the Central Committee Plenary Session of the Polish Workers' Party" published on page one of the September 14th issue is the same as the message published on page two of the September 13th issue of the Shijiazhuang Daily, and the content is the same, but there are some differences in the title and arguments. Your newspaper is "Overcome Right-Leaning Erroneous Ideas," while the Shijiazhuang Daily is "Oppose Left-Leaning Deviations." Please investigate which side made the mistake and explain it to avoid confusion among readers.

    Answer: -- The Shijiazhuang Daily made the mistake. (Editor)

    There are still a few errors in the summary of the War of Liberation achievements in North China.

    @Genius Comrade writes from the front: -- In the People's Daily No. 59 (August 12) first edition, first news item "North China Military Region Announces Achievements in the Second Year of the War of Liberation", the subheading "Thirty-eight enemy general-level officers killed or captured" is inconsistent with the statistics in the content. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area captured 15 and killed 3, a total of 18. The Jin-Cha-Ji area captured 14 and killed 4, totaling 18. The total of the two is 36. The thirty-eight in the subheading is obviously incorrect.

    In addition, in the content of the same article, the "captured enemy general-level officers" in the total of the two regions, the 15 regular army officers are also wrong, because the 5 lieutenant generals and 11 major generals should be 16. Only in this way can the addition of the 13 non-regular army officers match the total of 29. Moreover, in the two regions' figures, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region has 2 lieutenant generals and 6 major generals, and the Jin-Cha-Ji region has 3 lieutenant generals and 5 major generals, which also shows that it should be 16.

    Of course, anyone can see that this simple fact is wrong. In any case, it should not be so. Perhaps it was a mistake in editing, or the typesetting was wrong and the proofreading did not pay attention. In short, if it is wrong, it will affect the credibility of the Party newspaper. I hope you will pay more attention! I hope it won't happen again!

    Note: The errors pointed out by @ Comrade were indeed caused by the negligence of the newspaper's editorial staff. We are very grateful to readers from all parties for their valuable opinions on the editing work, and we are willing to improve our work under the supervision of the masses.
                                                                                                                     (Editor)

　　编读往来
    “新大众”和人民日报上登的解放区面积和人口的数目字为什么不一样？
    冀南鸡泽县委会胡全兴同志来信：——我看到人民日报第四八号第二版“解放战争第二年解放区大发展”和新大众第四十四期第二版“解放战争第二年消灭敌人一百五十二万”的消息里为啥人口和面积不同呢？新大众的解放区发展表内人口是“解放战争第一年末一万万三千一百万，第二年新解放三千七百万人，现在总数一万万六千八百万人”。面积是“解放战争第一年末八百八十万方里，第二年解放六十二万方里，现在总地面九百四十二万方里。”人民日报刊登的人口是：“解放战争第一年末一万三千一百万人，第二年末三千七百万人，现在为一万六千八百万人。”面积是：“第一年末二百二十万方公里，第二年末十五万五千方公里，现在为二百三十五万五千方公里。”为啥不一样呢？方里和方公里不一样？几方里顶一方公里？区别处在哪里？全中国到底有多少人口？人民日报刊登的全国人口是四万五千万人，是否四万万五千万呢？
    答：——“新大众”登的没有错，人民日报上登的也没有错。人口数目的不同，是一般的习惯的说法和严格的科学的说法的不同。如中国总人口，应是４５０００００００，一般的习惯的说法是四万万五千万，这容易使人误会；严格的科学的说法应该是四万五千万；或照一般的说法，读为四亿另五千万亦可。面积数目的不同，就因为一个是照公里计算，一个是照中国里计算。一公里等于中国里二里，一方公里就等于四方里。

    石家庄日报和人民日报上波工人党决议标题不一样是哪个报错了？
    冀晋中学顾远同志来信：——九月十四号第一版刊载，波兰工人党中央全会决议一文，和石家庄日报九月十三号第二版所载，消息同样，内容相同，但标题和论点有些出入，贵报是“克服右倾错误思想”，石门日报却为“反对左倾偏向”，请编辑同志考查一下，从那方排错，加以说明，以免读者模糊。
    答：——是石家庄日报错了。　　　　（编者）
    　　　　华北解放战争战绩总结还有几个数目字弄错了
    ＠天才同志从前线来信：——读人民日报第五九号（八月十二日）第一版第一条新闻“华北军区公布解放战争第二年战绩”一文中，小标题“毙俘敌将级军官三十八名”，但在内容中来统计不符，晋冀鲁豫区俘十五名毙三名共十八名，晋察冀区俘十四名，毙四名共计十八名，两者合计应为三十六名。两区总计中俘二十九名毙七名也是共三十六名，小标题之三十八名显系不对。
    另外在同一文之内容中两区合计中的“俘敌将级军官”内，正规军十五名也系错了，因为中将五名、少将十一名，两者应是十六名。也只有如此加上非正规军的十三名才符合总数的二十九名。而且两区数字中晋冀鲁豫区是中将二名少将六名，晋察冀区中将三名少将五名，也说明应该是十六名。
    当然这个简明事实谁也可以看出是错了的，不管怎样是不应该的。也许是编审时的疏忽，或者是排版错了校对没有注意，总之错了即会影响党报威信，希能多加注意！不再发生为盼！
    按：＠同志指出的错误，确系本报编辑工作人员的疏忽所致。我们非常感谢各方读者对编辑工作提出宝贵的意见，并愿在群众监督下改进我们的工作。
