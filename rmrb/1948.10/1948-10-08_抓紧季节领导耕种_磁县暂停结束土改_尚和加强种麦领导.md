　　Grasp the Season, Lead Farming
    Ci County Suspends Land Reform Conclusion; Shanghe Strengthens Leadership in Wheat Planting
    [Taihang Electric] The autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting in the entire Taihang area have entered a tense stage. To distinguish the priorities of work, seize the season, and strengthen leadership, the Ci County Party Committee has specifically instructed districts and villages to temporarily suspend the conclusion of land reform work. Villages that completed land reform before autumn should fully shift to leading production. Villages that have not completed land reform before autumn should focus on leading the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting. General villages should strengthen policy education and propaganda regarding the "whoever plants, harvests" policy to dispel the masses' concerns about planting wheat. After the above instructions were issued, all districts in the county quickly checked their implementation. The Second and Seventh Districts first reviewed their recent relaxation of production leadership and formulated specific plans for harvesting and planting work. Cadres in the Second District, after reviewing their focus on concluding land reform while neglecting production leadership, said: "The autumn busy season has started since the 6th of this month, but we were unwilling to report it to the county, fearing the county would tell us to shift to production early." In the allocation of cadre strength, both districts allocated most of their strength to a small number of villages concluding land reform, leaving only one district cadre in each district to oversee production. After the review, they formulated specific leadership methods based on the demands of the masses and the actual situation. The Seventh District decided: 1. Dispel the masses' concerns about planting wheat and encourage them to plant wheat with peace of mind. 2. The militia should be responsible for protecting the autumn harvest, patrolling frequently at night to prevent bad people from stealing. 3. In the key villages concluding land reform, cadres and representatives should be mobilized to lead production and overcome their "rest" mentality.
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] The Shanghe (newly established county) County Committee deeply examined the error of emphasizing the conclusion of land reform work and neglecting leadership in wheat planting, and made corrections. At the county-wide cadre conference in early September, the county made only empty calls for wheat planting, without researching specific methods and plans. Key villages had many cadres of high quality, while general villages had fewer cadres of lower quality. Work was simply aimed at completing the conclusion of land reform. District committees were all in key villages, neglecting production in general villages. For example, in the Third District, out of 31 cadres, 21 were engaged in concluding land reform in key villages. Production experience created in key villages was not disseminated to other areas; key villages were disconnected from general villages, and general villages lost direction in their work. For example, one district cadre in the First District did not know what to do when he went to the village, simply wandering around aimlessly. Instead of leading wheat planting, he only investigated changes in land before and after land reform and the contradictions between village cadres. Some district cadres blindly held mass meetings, talking empty production principles, which the masses disliked, saying: "We know about production even if you don't say it, what's the point of talking about it? It's just rambling." Some small districts only held meetings of village cadres to make arrangements, without implementing them among the masses. As a result, wheat planting in most villages was left to its own devices. After discussion, it was decided to regard wheat planting as the current central task, with each cadre recognizing the short planting season, deeply leading key areas, gaining experience, and promoting general villages. District cadres in key villages were reduced, and leadership in general villages was strengthened. It was also decided to publicize the "whoever plants, harvests" decree to dispel the masses' concerns about planting wheat. For households with no or little land, a portion of land could be allocated to them first, but not necessarily enough, with the land coming from public land and land of childless households.

　　抓紧季节领导耕种
    磁县暂停结束土改  尚和加强种麦领导
    【太行电】太行全区的秋收秋耕种麦已进入紧张阶段。为区分工作轻重缓急抓紧季节，加强领导，磁县县委特指示区村一律暂行停止结束土改工作。秋前结束土改工作村，全力转向领导生产。秋前结束土改尚未完成的村，则应全力领导秋收秋耕种麦。一般村应加强政策教育与谁种谁收的政策宣传，解除群众种麦顾虑。上述指示发出后，该县各区即迅速检查执行。二、七区首先把这段放松生产领导作了检讨，订出收耕工作的具体计划。二区干部检讨这段单纯为了结束土改，忽视了生产领导时说：“从本月六日起已开始秋忙，但也不愿给县里汇报，恐怕县里叫早日转向生产。”在干部力量的分配上，两个区均把大部力量分配到少数结束土改村庄，每区只留一个区干部照顾生产。经检讨后，均根据群众要求和实际情况订出了具体领导办法。七区决定：一、解除群众的种麦顾虑，叫群众安心生产种麦。二、民兵要负责保卫秋收，夜间经常巡查，防止坏人活动偷窃。三、在结束土改基点村，要动员干部代表领导生产，克服其“歇一歇”思想。
    【冀鲁豫电】尚和（新设县）县委会深刻检查偏重结束土改工作、忽视种麦领导的错误，并作出纠正办法。该县在九月初全县干部大会上，对种麦只作了空洞的号召，没有研究出具体的办法和计划，重点村干部多、质量高，一般村干部少、质量低，工作单纯的为完成结束土改，区委都在重点村，对一般村生产轻视。如三区三十一个干部，有二十一个在重点村搞结束土改。重点村创造出生产经验也不向外传播；重点与一般脱节，一般村工作失掉方向。如一区有个区干不知下到村干啥，到村里乱碰，无目的的干，他不去领导种麦，却只调查土改前后土地变化情况和村干间的矛盾。有的区干盲目开群众会空谈生产大道理，群众讨厌说：“您不说俺也知道生产，说它干啥？俗三道四的”。有的小区只开了村干会布置了一下，根本没贯彻到群众中去。这样大部村庄种麦陷于自流。讨论后决定把种麦当成目前中心任务，每个干部都认清种麦时期短促，深入领导重点，取得经验推动一般村。重点村区干减少，加强一般村领导，又决定宣传谁种谁收法令，解除群众种麦顾虑。对无地少地的户，可先抽给他一部土地，但不一定补足，土地来源从公地、绝户地里解决。
