　　★Since the North China Literary and Art Work Conference, in order to effectively implement the conference's guidelines and tasks, and strengthen the leadership of the mass cultural movement, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Hebei District Committee has established a Literature and Art Section. It has also decided that the propaganda departments of local district committees should establish literature and art cadres, and counties should establish organizations that do not separate from production to guide rural art movements. These should be composed of certain personnel from the county committee propaganda section, the county government education section, the county Communist Youth League, the people's education center, the district cultural and educational assistants, and the village central drama troupe, as well as reputable folk artists. This organization can be affiliated with the people's education center. The district will not establish organizations, and various cultural activities in the village will be uniformly led by the propaganda committee, without setting up separate organizations. Scattered folk artists in various villages will be allowed to voluntarily form groups, under the administrative and political leadership of the district government.
　　★In order to solve the problem of leading cadres in vigorously and widely launching rural art movements this winter and next spring, the district is instructing the "Frontline" and "Mass" drama troupes to start a training class, recruiting and transferring cadres from various counties for training. The district is preparing the following performance materials for this movement: (1) Organize cadres from old opera houses to revise several old opera scripts as quickly as possible and print and distribute them. (2) Allocate a certain amount of bonuses to launch a mass creation movement, calling for the creation of a large number of works that can be sung by folk artists and the masses. The Third Department of North China University has also sent people to Central Hebei to help the district carry out a planned and systematic popularization of literature and art.

　　冀中开展群众文艺运动
    ★自华北文艺工作会议后，冀中为有效地执行会议的方针与任务，加强对群众文艺运动的领导，中共冀中区党委宣传部已成立文艺科，并决定各地委宣传部设文艺干事，县建立不脱离生产的指导乡艺运动的组织，由县委宣传科、县政府教育科、县青年团、民教馆、区文教助理员、村中心剧团等之一定人员及有声望的民间艺人组成。这一组织可附设在民教馆内。区不设组织，村的各种文艺活动则统一由宣传委员会领导，亦不另设组织。散居在各村的零星民间艺人，听其自愿成立小组，行政上、政治上则由区政府领导。
    ★为解决今冬明春热烈广泛开展乡艺运动中的领导骨干问题，该区正责成“火线”、“群众”两剧社着手开办一训练班，从各县招收及调送干部进行训练。这一运动的演出材料，该区正准备：（一）组织旧剧院的干部尽速修改几个旧戏本印发下去。（二）拨出一定数目的奖金，发动群众性的创作运动，号召大量创作目前就能供民间艺人及群众演唱的作品。华北大学三部亦已派人去冀中，帮助该区有计划有系统的开展文艺普及运动。
