　　To Jingcun Jun, Jingxing:
    If a train hits and kills people or livestock on the tracks, not at a station, it is due to the pedestrian's own lack of caution, and the driver is hardly responsible. It is even more inappropriate to have the Jingxing Coal Mine compensate. If the donkey owner is truly unable to make a living because the donkey was killed, the government should provide relief, but they should not be held liable for compensation. However, the driver should pay special attention in the future to avoid such incidents.
　　　　　　　　　　(Ministry of Justice) To Zhao Zhengfan, Qigao, Pingle:
    Although Zhang Fushou is a veteran, he was sentenced to seven years in prison by the government for killing someone with a knife, and then escaped and disappeared. Your sister, Zhao Yuzhi, has grounds to request a divorce, and it should be approved. However, if there are other circumstances, then it should be considered separately. We have already instructed the Yangquan City Justice Department to investigate and handle the matter.
　　　
　　(Ministry of Justice) To Feng Gongtang, Xingtai County:
    According to your letter, your wife was sold to Yangqu County, Shanxi, thirty-one years ago. The journey was long, and she was able to travel with them, suggesting she was not abducted. She has been married to Xue Sancheng and his brother successively in Yangqu County for five or six years. When you went to claim her, what was the Xue family's reaction? What reason does the Yangqu County Justice Department have for not letting her return? The information is incomplete, and we cannot provide a specific answer.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Ministry of Justice)

　　信箱井陉兢存君：
    如果火车不是在车站内，而是在火车路上轧死人畜，是行路者自己不谨慎所致，司机人难以负责。让井陉煤矿赔偿更不应该。如果驴主人因轧死了驴，确实影响到不能生活时，应由政府设法救济，但也不是应该负赔偿责任。不过，司机人以后应特别加以注意，避免发生此类事件。
　　　　　　　　　　（司法部）平定七高赵征帆君：
    张福寿虽是退伍军人，但既持刀杀人，被政府判处徒刑七年，又越狱潜逃，杳无踪迹。你妹赵玉芝有理由要求离婚，应予批准，但如有其他情况，则又当别论，已令阳泉市司法处查明处理。　　　　　　　　
　　　
　　（司法部）邢台县冯公堂君：
    据来信，你妻于三十一年间，被人贩卖到山西阳曲县，道路遥远而能随同前往，似非被人拐骗。到阳曲县与薛三成及其兄先后结婚已五、六年，你去认领，薛家有何表现？阳曲县司法处有什么理由不叫她回来？材料不完全，无法作具体答复。
