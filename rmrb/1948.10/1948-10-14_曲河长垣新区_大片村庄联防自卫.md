Jilu Yu [Hebei-Shandong-Henan] Eighth Day Telegram: The masses in the Quhe and Changyuan New Districts of the Fourth Military Sub-district, resisting enemy and bandit looting, have risen up to organize joint defense for self-defense, stabilizing social order. In the Didi and Dixi areas of the Quhe Second District, and the ×× village area of the Fifth District, the villages have developed from guarding their own homes individually to joint defense by several villages, with "bell ringing as the signal." The county party committee is also vigorously organizing cadres and armed forces to support the joint defense, with the county, district and villages equipped with specialized cadres responsible for acquiring guns and hand grenades, issuing them to the joint defense forces, and actively establishing strong backbones. Now the joint defense work is even more developed than before. The × District has expanded from three villages, including ×× village, to eight villages, forming three large areas of village joint defense for self-defense, and is continuing to expand. Now the joint defense villages no longer provide burdens to the enemy. Small groups of enemies attempting to conscript laborers are also driven away by the joint support of the masses in the joint defense villages and the district teams' militia. Or small groups of enemies are suppressed, and grain requisition personnel are captured. From the seventh to the ninth of September, eight people were captured in three days. The Changyuan Third District was only opened up after the capture of Changyuan City last October. Although the masses' awareness has gradually increased after seven or eight months of our work, there are still some bad elements who, taking advantage of the bandit Wang Sanzhu's collusion with the 40th Division's incursions, organize small armed groups to loot, contain, and block roads everywhere. The leadership, based on this situation, also proposed protecting homes and defending themselves, and each village implemented night watch. Currently, 50 villages in the entire district have implemented night watch. The masses' morale is increasing day by day, and the enemy and bandits are gradually declining. For example, when a small group of local bandits entered ××× Village to loot, the night watch team discovered them and shouted loudly, causing the bandits to panic and flee in disarray. The livestock of a middle peasant family in ×× Village was taken outside the village by bandits, and the home guard team chased them back. The masses in each village not only defend against external enemies but also pay attention to monitoring bad elements in their own village. For example, ×× Village suffered three robberies in a row, and the masses learned from this that the original instigators were bad elements from their own village. Now the criminal and his five accomplices have all been arrested by our government. Since then, the order in the whole district has gradually stabilized, and no more robbery incidents have occurred.

[Jilu Yu telegram]: In various places in the Third Military Sub-district, incidents of the masses, unable to bear the oppression and looting of the Jiang bandits, picking up carrying poles or wooden sticks to beat Jiang bandits to death have been continuously occurring. Since the enemy's reorganized 83rd Division was stationed in Fengxian City, starting from the wheat harvest, 17 catties of wheat per mu have been extracted as burdens, and other miscellaneous expenses are not included. The bandit army goes down to the villages every day to pull cattle and arrest people, raping women everywhere, causing the masses to hate them to the bone. Under the enemy's inhuman and bloody persecution, the masses have risen up to resist. In a village south of Fengxian City, a woman was snatched away by the bandit army, and the masses were extremely angry and fought the enemy with carrying poles and wooden sticks. In Zhou Village, south of the city, Jiang bandits wanted to rape Wang's wife, Wang could not bear it any longer and beat a bandit to death with a stick. Also, in a village east of the city, two old men and two young women were turning sweet potato seedlings when the bandit army grabbed the two women and attempted to rape them in the cornfield. The two old men grabbed the sticks used to turn sweet potato seedlings and went up to beat them, and the women also rose up to fight. Both bandits were beaten to death.

　　曲河长垣新区
    大片村庄联防自卫
    【冀鲁豫八日电】四分区曲河、长垣新区群众抵抗敌匪抢劫，纷起自卫组织联防，安定社会秩序。曲河二区堤东、堤西，五区××村一带，已由一村为单位站岗看家发展成为几个村联防，“敲钟为令”。县委亦大力组织干部武装支援联防，村县区配备专门负责干部掌握筹备枪支、手榴弹，发给联防，并从中积极树立坚强骨干。现联防工作较前更大有发展，×区由××村三个村，发展到八个村，形成三大片村庄的联防自卫，现仍继续扩大中。现在联防村庄已不再给敌人出负担。有小股的敌人企图拉夫，亦被联防村群众及区队民兵互相支援打跑。或清剿小股敌人，捕捉催粮人员。自九月初七至初九三天即捕住八名。长垣三区是从去年十月打开长垣城才开辟的，全区五十五村，虽经我七八个月的工作，群众觉悟逐渐提高，但仍有部分坏分子乘王匪三祝配合四十师的窜扰，组织小股武装到处抢劫、牵制、截路；领导上根据这种情况，也提出保家自卫，各村实行打更。现全区已有五十村实行了打更。群众情绪日高，敌匪日渐消沉。如×××庄小股土匪进村抢劫，打更队发觉了，齐声喊冲，匪惊慌失措，狼狈逃窜。××村一家中农的牲口被土匪牵到村外，看家队又追了回来。各村群众不但防御外敌，还注意监视本村坏分子。如××村连遭三次抢劫，群众便从中了解，原系本村底线勾引，现该犯及其同伙五人已全被我政府逮捕。从此全区秩序逐渐稳定，再没有发生抢劫事件。
    【冀鲁豫电】三分区各地群众，因不堪蒋匪压迫与抢掠，拿起扁担或木棍打死蒋匪的事件不断发生。自敌整编八十三师驻丰县城后，从麦收起，每亩已出负担麦子十七斤，其他杂支还不在内。匪军每日下乡牵牛抓人，到处奸淫妇女，使群众痛恨入骨。在敌人残无人道的血腥迫害下，群众纷纷起来反抗。丰县城南某庄一个妇女被匪军抢去，群众愤极，即用扁担、木棍和敌人拼起来。城南周庄蒋匪要强奸王某之妻，王忍无可忍，一棍子把一个匪军打死。又城东某庄两个老头同两个青年妇女正翻红薯秧子，匪军将两个妇女抓到棒子地企图强奸，两个老头拿着翻红薯秧子的棍子上去就打，妇女也起来打，两个匪军都被打死。
