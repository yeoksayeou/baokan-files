　　Workers at a Military Uniform Factory
　　Cherish Machines and Reduce Damage
　　Workers at the Second Bureau Rush to Produce Winter Clothing
　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] In a certain factory of the Military Supply Department's First Bureau, the task of manufacturing winter clothing was not completed in the first month (mid-July to mid-August). The factory leadership convened a meeting of cadres and team leaders for self-criticism. Everyone pointed out that the main reason was that too many machines were broken. Out of a total of 63 machines, an average of more than 20 needed repair every day. Major problems took two to three days to repair. The workers said, "As long as the machines can be used, we have no problem completing the task." Based on the above situation, everyone came up with two solutions: First, cherish the machines, prohibit stepping on the machines too fast, and wipe them once a day to reduce the damage rate of the machines. Second, overcome the problem of old workers and new workers being disconnected in the repair room, with each doing their own thing; we must work together to research and reduce repair time. After the meeting, everyone earnestly implemented these measures. Now only about ten machines are waiting to be repaired every day; repair time for general problems ranges from half an hour to three hours, and even the biggest problems do not exceed one day. They also ensure that machines are repaired immediately when broken, without storing broken machines. Hao Jinyue, a machine repair worker, said, "In the past, the repair room was full of machines waiting to be repaired. When repairing them, my mind was confused, and I couldn't fix them. Now there are fewer broken machines, and we can research together when repairing them. The repairs are faster, and everyone feels more cheerful!" They also use their time to make shuttle bobbins. In the 24 days of September, they have already made 30, which are very durable. This not only guarantees the power of the machines but also saves the consumption of parts. In order to reward their creativity, the factory decided to extract a portion of the value of the shuttle bobbins made as a production bonus for the repair room under the principle of benefiting both public and private interests.

　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] After two months of ideological education, the No. 1 Clothing Factory of the Second Bureau of the North China Military Region Supply Department has eliminated some lax, disorganized, and anarchic undesirable phenomena. All employees have automatically launched a campaign to rush to produce cotton clothing to support the front lines. Many workers voluntarily worked overtime during their lunch break, started work earlier every day, and did not leave the workshop until they could no longer see the needle. They forgot about hunger and fatigue, and even half a day after the end-of-work bell rang, they were reluctant to leave the workshop. Comrades in the Fifth Group voluntarily worked overtime after dinner and on Sunday afternoons, and the cutting group did not take Sundays off. Lian Jinfu and Guo Zhenhong averaged 62 pieces of clothing per day, while Yuan Eryang and Li Libao averaged 70 pieces. Some comrades even did not forget to work while sick. Li Hongxiu of the Sixth Group suffered from severe malaria and dysentery, but on the second day after his condition improved slightly, he dragged his emaciated body and rushed to work. In five days of intense blitz, the Second and Sixth Groups exceeded the original plan by 50 sets (of cotton clothing), the Third Group exceeded by 100 sets, and the cutting group exceeded by 495 sets (of clothing pieces). After being announced on the blackboard newspaper, everyone's enthusiasm was even higher. Comrades in the Fourth Group ran to the factory leadership and asked for kerosene to work overtime at night, but the factory leadership persuaded them to take care of their health. According to preliminary statistics, the dyeing workshop dyed 430,000 square feet of colored cloth in ten days, an average of 140% more than the previous ten days. The machine workshop averaged 110% more work than the previous ten days.

　　军供被服某厂工友
    爱护机器减少损坏
    二局工友突击赶制冬衣
    【本报讯】军供部一局某厂在制造冬装第一个月（七月半到八月半）没有完成任务，厂部召集干部及组长开会检讨，大家提出主要原因是机子坏的太多，一共六十三架机子，每天平均有廿多架要修。毛病较大的，一修理就得两三天。工人说：“只要机子能供上用，我们完成任务没有问题。”根据以上情况，大家想出了两个办法：第一、爱护机器，禁止过快的蹬机子，每天擦一次，减低机子损坏率。第二、克服修理室你修你的，我干我的老工人与新工人脱节的毛病；要共同研究，减少修理时间。会后大家认真执行，现在每天只有十来架机子待修；修理时间，一般毛病由半小时到三小时，最大的毛病也超不过一天，并做到坏了就修，不存坏机子。修机工人郝金月说：“过去修理室机子一存一堆，修理时脑筋就乱，就越修不出来。现在机子坏的少了，修理时能互相研究，修的快，每个人精神也痛快！”他们还利用时间包做梭胆，九月份二十四天已包成了三十个，很耐用。这样不但保证了机子的动力，同时也节省了零件的消耗。厂部为着奖励他们的创造，决定在公私两利原则下，在包成梭胆的价值中，提出一部分作为修理室的生产奖金。
