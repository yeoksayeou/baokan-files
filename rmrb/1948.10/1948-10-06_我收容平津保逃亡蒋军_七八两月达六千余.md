[Jizhong Electric] Under the victorious influence of our People's Liberation Army on all fronts, desertions among soldiers in the Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, and other areas are increasing daily. In July and August, the "Chiang Army Deserter Reception Centers" in the 8th, 9th, and 10th Military Sub-districts of Jizhong collectively received 6,561 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who had deserted or voluntarily surrendered. Among them, 2,458 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers fled from Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, and areas north of the Daqing River, while 4,103 fled from Changchun, Shenyang, and other places in the Northeast. A raiding party of 19 men from bandit Wang Fenggang's 17th Regiment surrendered as a unit, and there were five instances of entire squads surrendering, with over a hundred others surrendering individually. They brought with them six machine guns, one small cannon, 59 rifles and pistols, over 3,900 rounds of ammunition, and 50 hand grenades. No matter how Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits deceive them, many Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers have come to understand the lenient policy of our Party and our army. According to Yuan Baoguo and six other soldiers of the Transportation Company of the 129th Regiment of the 43rd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek 94th Army who fled from Liulihe: Although the Chiang Kai-shek officers deceive the soldiers every day, saying that the Eighth Route Army will kill them if they are caught, the soldiers have secretly heard that the Liberation Army implements a lenient policy. There are many deserters. Two months ago, the company had a total of 108 men, and before they escaped, only 59 remained. The 19 men in the raiding party of bandit Wang Fenggang's 17th Regiment were all peasants who had been conscripted in February and March of this year. After being conscripted, they thought about deserting every day. On July 28, taking advantage of the opportunity of Wang Fenggang bandits changing defenses, they fled to the liberated area with 17 rifles and pistols. Zhao Wenrong, from a village in Yongqing, was forcibly made a village security guard in the puppet Da Township of Longhuzhuang after being captured by the enemy. Once, he took the opportunity to kill Xu Zhi, the most reactionary security secretary of the puppet Da Township, and fled to the liberated area. The 2nd Company of the Field Artillery Battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek New 2nd Army stationed in Nanguan, Baoding, lost thirty-one men who deserted on June 30 and July 1. A squad of the 6th Brigade of bandit Zhu Zhankui's unit under the puppet 3rd Special Office in Duliu, led by squad leader Wu Dehua, deserted with five guns on September 2 while en route to Tangguantun. The unit had not been paid for four months, and the officers deducted the soldiers' daily food allowance, so the soldiers were not eating enough, resulting in a serious desertion phenomenon. After Zhang Rongde, a soldier of the 5th Brigade of the unit, escaped, the enemy pursued him closely. Later, they shouted: "Who are you doing this for? Have you forgotten your roots!" The pursuers then stopped chasing.

　　我收容平津保逃亡蒋军
    七八两月达六千余
    【冀中电】在我各线解放军胜利影响下，平、津、保等地区军逃亡日增。七、八两个月中，冀中八、九、十各分区“蒋军罢战招待所“共收容逃亡及自动投诚的蒋军六千五百六十一名。其中从平、津、保及大清河北等地逃来的蒋军二千四百五十八名，从东北长春、沈阳等地逃来的四千一百零三名。整队投诚的有王匪凤岗十七团之突击队十九人，整班投诚的有五次，连零星投诚的共一百余人。携出机枪六挺，小炮一门，长短枪五十九支，子弹三千九百余发，手榴弹五十枚。无论蒋傅匪怎样欺骗，但很多蒋军官兵已了解了我党我军的宽大政策。据从琉璃河逃来的蒋匪九四军四三师一二九团输送连士兵袁保国等七人谈：虽然蒋匪长官天天欺骗士兵说什么八路逮住就弄死，但士兵们背地里都听说解放军实行宽大政策。开小差的很多，两个月前该连共一百零八人，到他们逃出前，还只剩下五十九人。王匪凤岗十七团突击队十九个人都是今年二、三月里被抓去的农民。他们被抓后，天天想开小差，七月二十八日，乘着王匪换防的机会，带着长短枪十七支逃到解放区。永清某村赵文荣被敌人抓走，强迫在龙虎庄伪大乡当了乡丁后，一次乘机将伪大乡中最反动的警卫干事徐志打死，逃到解放区。驻保定南关的蒋匪新二军野炮营二连，六月三十、七月一日两天就跑了三十一个。驻独流伪三专署朱匪占奎部六大队一个班，在班长吴德华率领下，全班八人携枪五支于九月二日调赴唐官屯途中逃出。该部已四个月没发饷，每天的菜金都被当官的扣下，士兵们每天吃不饱，因而逃亡现象很严重。该部五大队士兵张荣德逃出后，敌人追的很紧，后来他们喊：“你们为了谁？你们忘了本！”后边追兵就不追了。
