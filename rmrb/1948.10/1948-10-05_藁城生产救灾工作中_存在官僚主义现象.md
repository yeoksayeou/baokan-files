[Ji Zhong Electric] The Eleventh District Committee, in inspecting the production and disaster relief work in Gaocheng, found that the county's production and disaster relief work showed signs of relaxed leadership. Although the county committee also convened a meeting of district secretaries in the disaster area and arranged discussions on production, the meeting decided to focus on organizing manpower and animal power to transport coal and develop textiles, and required the districts to place the main cadres in the villages most severely affected by the disaster to personally grasp this work. However, due to a lack of inspection, after the district branch secretaries returned to their districts, only three villages in the Eighth District and two villages in the Seventh District completed the distribution of relief grain. The remaining 80% of the villages did not complete it, and large quantities of relief grain were piled up and not released, while disaster victims unable to live were in urgent need of relief. At the county committee's meeting to review this phase of production and disaster relief, it was said that blindly organizing the masses for production and disaster relief was the biggest shortcoming in this work. The county only knew to arrange for the organization of manpower and animal power to transport coal, but did not consider that the local people did not have the habit of burning coal, and in addition, with the arrival of autumn, coal was not easy to sell, and transportation did not make money. The same was true of weaving cloth; after the cloth was woven, no sales channels could be found. These shortcomings were reviewed, and it was decided to allocate 1 million yuan of funds from the county's oil mill, some funds from the Nanmeng branch cooperative, and 20,000 jin of loan grain to purchase local cloth from the disaster area.

(It is correct for the Gaocheng County Committee to review the shortcomings in leading production and disaster relief work in the disaster area, and to allocate some grain and funds to purchase local cloth from the disaster area to solve the difficulty of selling local cloth in the disaster area. However, it must be pointed out that this attitude of not inspecting and supervising in a timely manner and not caring about the suffering of the disaster victims is bureaucratic in disaster relief work and should be deeply reviewed and corrected. – Editor)

　　藁城生产救灾工作中
    存在官僚主义现象
    【冀中电】十一地委在检查藁城生产救灾工作中，发现该县生产救灾工作有放松领导现象。该县县委虽然也召开了灾区区书会议，布置讨论了生产，会上决定：以组织人力、畜力运输煤炭发展纺织为主，要求区对村的生产救灾领导，一定把主要干部放到灾情最重的村庄，亲自掌握这一工作。但因为缺乏检查，各区支书回区后，十二大中只有八区三个村、七区两个村完成了发放赈粮，其余百分之八十的村庄却没有完成，赈粮大批压着不放，无法生活的灾民却急待救济。该县县委在检查这一阶段的生产救灾会上说：盲目的组织群众生产救灾，是这次工作中的最大缺点。县里只知道布置组织人力、畜力运输煤炭，却没有考虑到当地群众没有烧炭的习惯，再加上秋天到来，煤炭不好卖，运来不赚钱。织布也是织出布来找不到销路。检讨了这些缺点，并决定抽调本县油坊一百万元资金，南孟分社一部资金，两万斤贷粮，来收买灾区土布。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （藁城县委对领导灾区生产救灾工作的缺点进行了检讨，并抽出一部粮款收买灾区土布，解决灾区土布销路困难这是对的。但必须指出，这种不及时检查督促，不关心灾民痛苦的态度，是救灾工作中的官僚主义，应再深刻检讨纠正。——编者）
