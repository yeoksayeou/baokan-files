Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 9th. The Northwest Field Army of the People's Liberation Army conducted effective rectification training in the summer using the "Three Evaluations" – evaluating fighting spirit, evaluating wisdom, and evaluating policies. This is a continuation and development of the new-style military consolidation movement that the Northwest Field Army carried out last winter using the method of grievance-airing and three investigations. This summer's rectification training used the method of three evaluations to examine the class consciousness, fighting will, and work style of every commander and fighter in all departments of the army. It criticized the petty-bourgeois individualistic ideology and other unhealthy tendencies, and promoted the uprightness of the working class and its army—a high sense of responsibility to serve the people, a heroic, tenacious, and unyielding fighting will, and the spirit of new-style combat heroes who sacrifice themselves.

The so-called three evaluations are mostly combined with the merit evaluation and review movement after each battle. On the one hand, the party committees at the column, brigade, and regiment levels carry them out from top to bottom; on the other hand, the company branch leads the revolutionary soldiers' committee to carry them out from bottom to top. The general steps are to first evaluate typical examples, and then evaluate cadres before evaluating the masses. The general focus of the three evaluations is on evaluating fighting spirit, but this varies depending on the specific situation of the troops. Some troops have shortcomings in command, so they focus on evaluating command; some troops have poor discipline, so they focus on evaluating discipline and work style.

Because of the foundation of the three investigations and rectification training last winter, this summer's rectification training has the following characteristics:

(1) More leadership, order, and planning. For example, the 4th Regiment of a certain brigade, the regimental committee first convened a meeting of representatives composed of soldier representatives (one from each squad), party member representatives (one from each group), and cadres above platoon level. They selected four typical examples, good and bad, from the cadres, and used them as demonstrations for evaluation at this representative meeting. After gaining experience, the representatives then returned to their respective battalions or companies to first evaluate three to five typical examples, before universally carrying out mutual evaluation by squads and platoons. This allowed the movement to avoid detours and mistakes.

(2) The leading role of cadres is very significant. When soldiers, especially newly liberated soldiers, still harbored various doubts and concerns, cadres first came forward to self-report and self-evaluate, seriously and earnestly exposing and examining their own mistakes and shortcomings, thus inspiring soldiers to enthusiastically participate in the evaluation and exposing various things that had been hidden in their hearts, such as concealing history, concealing documents, and attempting to desert. This removed the barriers between some old soldiers, new soldiers, and liberated soldiers, and consolidated the troops.

(3) Patient reasoning, seeking truth from facts. Giving the evaluated person full opportunity to speak, refute, and appeal, and not arbitrarily "labeling" them, stating what is true, not exaggerating any aspect, and thus making comrades who are rewarded and those who are criticized and disciplined feel convinced.

The most effective example of using typical examples to promote the entire movement is the Fourth Branch of the "East Society" unit. The combat hero of this unit, Liu Sihu, came from a hired peasant background. After joining the army, he was active in his work, progressive in his thinking, good at uniting the masses, and patient in reforming backward elements. In the Yichuan Wazijie battle, he single-handedly charged into the enemy ranks and stabbed four enemies to death. Using this figure as a typical example, the unit launched the Liu Sihu movement, using the qualities of a new type of combat hero as the standard to examine and educate the troops, launching a competition movement in which everyone compared themselves with Liu Sihu in terms of class (comparing "roots"), comparing thoughts, and comparing progress, requiring everyone to strive for self-reliance in combat, thus setting off a wave of training in ideology and military skills.

After implementing the three-evaluation rectification training, the troops' appearance changed greatly: confused thoughts were clarified, and the atmosphere of progress and upward mobility was filled. Right and wrong were clear, merits and demerits were clear, rewards and punishments were clear, and progress and backwardness were clear. Everyone was determined, everyone made plans, and they enthusiastically participated in large-scale training.

### 西北新式整军运动继续发展 　开展“三评”进行整训  部队面貌一新充满进步空气

　　西北新式整军运动继续发展
    开展“三评”进行整训
    部队面貌一新充满进步空气
    【新华社西北九日电】人民解放军西北野战军在夏季用评斗志、评智慧、评政策的“三评”进行了有效的整训。这是西北野战军去年冬季用诉苦及三查方法进行的新式整军运动的继续和发展。这次的夏季整训，以三评的方法检查了全军各部门每个指战员的阶级觉悟、斗争意志、工作作风等，批判了小资产阶级个人主义思想及其他歪风邪气，发扬了劳动阶级及其军队的正气——为人民服务的高度责任心，英勇顽强不屈不挠的战斗意志，和自我牺牲的新式战斗英雄的气魄。
    所谓三评，大都与各部队在每次战役后的评功查过运动相结合，一方面由纵队、旅、团各级党委从上而下进行，另一方面由连队支部领导革命军人委员会自下而上进行。一般的步骤是先评典型，先评干部后评群众。三评的一般重心是在评斗志方面，但也因部队的具体情况而异。有些部队在指挥上有缺点，就着重评指挥；有些部队纪律作风不好，就着重评纪律，评作风。
    因为有去冬三查整训的基础，今夏整训就有以下的特点：
    （一）更加有领导、有秩序和有计划。如某旅四团，团委先召开一个由战士代表（每班一名），党员代表（每小组一名）和排以上干部组成的代表会，选择干部中的好坏四个典型，在这个代表会上作评查的示范，取得经验以后，再由代表们分别回去在全营或全连先评三、五个典型，以后才普遍由班排互相评查。这样就使运动少走弯路和少犯错误。
    （二）干部的带头作用很显著。当战士特别是新解放战士中开始尚存有各种疑惑及顾虑时，干部便首先出来自报自评、严肃认真地揭发与检讨自己的错误和缺点，因而启发了战士热烈参加评查，并且揭露出各种一直隐藏在心里的事情，例如隐瞒历史、隐瞒证件和企图开小差等。这就解除了一些老战士、新战士、解放战士之间的隔阂，巩固了部队。
    （三）耐心说理，实事求是。给予被评者以充分发言、反驳和申诉的机会，不随便“扣帽子”，是啥就是啥，不夸大任何一面，并因而使受奖励和受批评处分的同志都心悦诚服。
    用典型推动整个运动的最有效的例子便是“东社”部的四支部。该部的战斗英雄刘四虎，雇农出身，参军后工作积极，思想进步，善于团结群众和耐心改造落后分子，在宜川瓦子街战斗中曾单人冲入敌阵刺死四个敌人。用这个人物做典型，该部开展了刘四虎运动，以新型战斗英雄的品质为标准来检查教育部队，展开人人和刘四虎比阶级（比“根子”），比思想，比进步，要求达到人自为战的竞赛运动，因而掀起练思想，练武艺的热潮。
    实行三评的整训后，部队的面目大变：紊乱的思想澄清了，进步向上的空气充满了。是非分明，功过分明，赏罚分明，进步与落后分明。人人下决心，个个订计划，热烈参加大练兵。
