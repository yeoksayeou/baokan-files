　　Pingshan Strengthens Production Leadership
  　General Cadres Still Urgently Need Specific Help
    [Our Newspaper's Report] In the autumn harvest and wheat planting, Pingshan, in addition to general propaganda to confirm land rights and stabilize the masses' emotions, also strives to solve practical difficulties, calling on the masses to use the fruits of land reform to buy livestock collectively and to strive for the help of resident organs' personnel and livestock in harvesting and cultivation, which has achieved remarkable results. The county's production promotion agency bought back more than fifty heads of livestock from Shanxi and sold them at prices lower than the market price, and loaned twenty *shi* of black beans to supplement the lack of fertilizer. These have effectively solved some problems. The county also extracted more than twenty cadres to coordinate with district cadres to go to the countryside, focusing on leading production, emphasizing checking on substitute cultivation, and solving the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, and cadres' families. The work in the eighth and ninth districts, personally led by Comrade Zhang Chengmei, the secretary of the county party committee, has made significant progress. Comrade Zhang talked to the masses at Zhao's Village at any time and place to study and help them produce, deeply understand the situation, and found that several families, such as Zhao Mengrui's family, in the village have benefited from seed soaking every year. He immediately instructed Comrade Ge Ying, who was working in the village, to seize this example, focus on publicizing seed soaking, and six village cadres first implemented it themselves and began to expand publicity. Comrade Zhang implemented the focused allocation of cadres, inspected and instructed cadres according to the different situations of each village, and solved urgent problems. For example, the bridge in Diaor Village in the Ninth District collapsed after the rain, and no cadres or masses took care of it, so that people changed from pushing soil carts to carrying loads to transport manure for wheat planting, wasting a lot of labor. He used this example to illustrate that the urgent task of the village work was to first lead the masses to repair the bridge. Due to Comrade Zhang's specific help, the cadres in the village solved some practical problems. For example, Mijia Gou Village in the Eighth District quickly dealt with floating wealth and solved the difficulties of middle peasants' farm tools and seeds caused by wrong struggles. The village cadres can also focus on wheat planting. Xigang Nan Village seized the opportunity to solve the labor and animal power difficulties of four military families (Comrade Feng Shuxin, who used to work in the village, stayed for a few days and did not know there were several military families). In the past, some comrades went to the village only to learn about the general situation from the village cadres, or collect typical materials, count the number of cultivated land, and prepare to write reports. This time, through Comrade Zhang's continuous questioning of the situation, they understood the actual problems existing among the masses and also understood the actual situation of the cadres and their work, which enabled the work to achieve the above results. This experience is worth learning for other cadres, but general cadres still urgently need specific help to find a way out for their work.
    However, judging from the progress below, the production leadership is not deep enough. At the grassroots village cadre meeting held by county and district cadres in Mengbao, First District, on September 24, three tasks of production, cloth levy, and yield adjustment were deployed at the same time (cloth levy was decided by the higher authorities to be completed during this period. Yield adjustment was also a task that the First District could no longer postpone). Although production was emphasized, there was no specific discussion. Cadres in the First, Eighth, and Ninth Districts generally felt that they lacked experience in leading production and had no way to do it. Although they have begun to feel the importance of production as a task, they feel that they have few methods due to rarely going deep into the masses to lead production in the past. Comrade Kang Zhaoyi, the secretary of the First District, said that he lacked confidence in leading production and felt that he had nothing to say to the peasants about production. Comrade Xu Guilin, the head of the Ninth District, said that he had ways to farm himself, but he felt at a loss when leading the masses. This requires district cadres to go deep into the masses to learn how to lead production, while county-level leading comrades should provide timely assistance. (Lin Mo)

### 平山加强生产领导　一般干部仍急待具体帮助

　　平山加强生产领导
  　一般干部仍急待具体帮助
    【本报讯】平山在秋收种麦中，除一般宣传确定地权，安定群众情绪外，并力求解决实际困难，号召群众利用土改果实伙买牲口；争取驻村机关人员、牲畜帮助收耕；已获得显著成绩。县生产推进社自山西购回五十多头牲口，较低于市价卖出，并贷出廿石黑豆补肥料的不足。这些都有效的解决了部分问题。县上并抽出二十几个干部协同各区干部下乡，以领导生产为中心，着重检查代耕，解决烈、军、干属的困难。县委书记张成梅同志亲自领导的八、九区，工作显有进展。张同志曾在赵家庄村随时随地找群众谈话研究，并帮助群众生产，深入的了解情况，发现该村有赵孟瑞等几家，浸种种麦，年年得益，即指示在该村工作的葛英同志，抓住这一实例，着重宣传浸种，六个村干部首先自己实行，并开始扩大宣传。张同志对干部实行有重点的分配，自己巡回检查，指示干部根据各村不同情况，解决迫切问题。如九区吊儿村下雨塌了桥，干部和群众都无人管，以至人们种麦送粪由土车推改为挑，浪费不少劳力。他以此实例说明，该村工作的迫切任务就是先领导群众修好桥。由于张同志具体帮助，干部在村都解决了一些实际问题。如八区米家沟村迅速的处理浮财，解决了错斗中农的农具、子种困难。村干部也可安心种麦。西岗南村抓紧解决了四家军属的劳、畜力困难（原在该村工作的冯树新同志住了几天，不知有几家军属）。过去有些同志到村，只是找村干部了解一般情况，或搜集典型材料，统计耕种数目字，准备回去写报告。这次经张同志不断寻问情况，了解了群众中所存在的实际问题，也了解了干部和工作的实际情况，才使工作获得了以上的成绩。这个经验，值得其他干部学习，但一般干部仍急待具体帮助，找出工作出路。
    但从下边进行情况来看，生产领导还不够深入。县区干部九月二十四日在一区孟堡召开的基点村干部会上，同时布置了生产、征布、调整产量三件工作（征布是上级在这一时期决定完成的。调整产量也是一区不能再缓的工作）。虽着重号召了生产，但未具体讨论。一、八、九等区的干部，普遍感到对领导生产缺乏经验，没办法。虽然作为一个任务来讲，他们已开始感到生产之重要；但由于过去很少深入群众领导生产，现在感到办法少。一区区书康兆一同志说他对领导生产十分缺乏信心，感到对农民讲生产有些无话可说。九区区长许桂林同志讲，他自己种地有办法；但领导群众则感到无从下手。这就需要区干深入群众学习领导生产办法，而县级领导同志则应及时给予帮助。　　　（林沫）
