(Jizhong Electric) The broad masses of Jinxi are implementing a combination of labor and military affairs, using armed forces to protect the rush harvest. In late August, the Jiang bandits in Jinxi formed a joint township with fourteen puppet major townships, including Taohe (under Anci), Ceche, and Gaoqiao (under Baxian), and local bandits. They concentrated their forces and used large carts to plunder grain. In the enemy-occupied areas, they demanded 15 catties of wheat, 12 catties of green grain, and 30 catties of temple field grain per mu, as well as township grain, county grain, quilt fees, winter clothing fees, horse fees, intelligence fees, festival fees, etc., all to be paid within sixteen days. In addition, they arrested people everywhere and forced the masses to redeem them with grain. In the small Zhangchang Village, with only ten households, eight people were arrested at once, and it took 170 shi of grain to redeem them. This forced the local masses to implement armed self-defense to protect the autumn harvest. In the border areas of Jinwu, the masses in dozens of villages have taken up rifles and cannons and organized themselves. After implementing the combination of labor and military affairs, the militia of a certain village collectively harvested 200 mu of corn in twelve or thirteen days, and most of it was fortified. Under armed protection, the masses in each village rushed to harvest day and night. The local armed forces and militia in the area went deep behind enemy lines to strike the enemy. Jinwu County formed a flying demolition team, which went deep into both sides of the highway near Shengfang, laying mines to block the enemy. On September 7, a company of the 24th Regiment of bandits was plundering grain in Shigezhuang. The Jinwu District Armed Work Team chased the enemy away, wounding four and capturing three guns, and returning the ten shi of grain abandoned by the enemy to the original owner. On the 14th, the enemy came out to plunder grain in Lilangcheng. The Jinwu Regional Armed Forces moved deep behind enemy lines and largely resolved the Donggugang puppet major township, capturing the deputy of the major township, Liu Hongtian, and seven others alive, seizing five guns, and thwarting the enemy's grain-grabbing plan. At 5:00 p.m. on the 16th, the 2nd Battalion of the 285th Regiment of the 95th Division of the 62nd Army of the bandits stationed in Nandongpu had just set out to plunder grain when the Jinwu District Armed Work Team and militia attacked the village and destroyed the enemy's fortifications. On the morning of the 17th, the enemy troops came out again to plunder grain and were wounded by the militia of nearby villages and the Armed Work Team of a certain district, killing seven. That night, a part of the Jinxi Regional Armed Forces again launched a swift action to attack the Dawang Village, eight miles west of the Beining Road, annihilating more than 60 soldiers of the First Company of the Bandit Security 24th Regiment, seizing two machine guns and 34 rifles and short guns.
