[Jilu Yu Electric] Henan General Branch News Agency reported on the 12th that Nanwang County is now vigorously managing water, striving to plant wheat in flooded land in a timely manner. The county's low-lying areas had accumulated water which had not yet been drained. Furthermore, on September 24th and 25th, there were continuous heavy rains, causing unprecedented floods, damaging a large number of late autumn crops (soybeans, sweet potatoes, etc.), making autumn plowing and planting extremely difficult. According to preliminary understanding, only eight large depressions in Bali Slope, Lao Sengtang and other places, as well as Gaoyantun and Huangga villages have significant water accumulation. Including smaller areas of accumulated water in various districts, the county has approximately 2,200 hectares of flooded land, accounting for more than 30 percent of the county's 7,224 hectares of arable land. The water depth reaches six meters in some places. Therefore, draining the accumulated water and striving to plant wheat has become an urgent demand of the broad masses. The County Party Committee has determined that leading the masses to drain water and plant wheat is the current top priority. The county government urgently dispatched two section chiefs after the rain to conduct specific investigations and provide assistance in various districts. After several days of intense work, it is expected that by the 7th to 8th of this month, the accumulated water in the seven districts, totaling more than 50 hectares, can be completely drained. The accumulated water in the southern part of the sixth district is currently flowing smoothly to the outside through the seventh district, and it will be completed soon. Twelve hectares of accumulated water have been drained from the West Sub-district of the third district. The accumulated water in the fourth district is currently being dredged to the Jinhe Zhao Wanghe River. More than 400 hectares of fertile land can also be restored in a short time. These areas can be planted with wheat in ten days or so.

　　南旺全县疏水种麦
    【冀鲁豫电】河南总支社十二日报导，南旺全县现正大力治水，争取淹地及时种麦。该县洼地日前积水尚未进行疏顺，九月二十四、二十五日又连降大雨，造成空前水灾，大批晚秋（豆子、红薯等）遭受损害，秋耕秋种十分困难。据初步了解，全县仅八里坡、老僧堂等处八个大洼以及高彦屯、黄垓两村积水较大，再加各区一些小片积水，全县淹地在二千二百顷左右，占全县耕地七千二百二十四顷的百分之三十以上，水深处达六公尺，故疏除积水争取种麦已成为广大群众的迫切要求。县委会乃确定以领导群众疏水种麦为当前首要任务。县府急于雨后派出两科长分赴各区具体勘查协助。经数日来紧张工作，预料至本月七日到八日，七区五十余顷积水可全部疏完。六区南部积水，刻正经七区顺利外流，不日可完。三区西小区已有十二顷积水疏出，四区积水现正向靳河赵王河疏通，四百余顷良田亦可于短时间内复原。这些地区在十余日后，即可种上麦子。
