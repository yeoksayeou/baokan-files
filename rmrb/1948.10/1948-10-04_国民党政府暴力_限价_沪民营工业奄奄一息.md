　　Kuomintang Government's Violent "Price Controls" Leave Shanghai's Private Industry on the Verge of Collapse

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd -- Comprehensive reports indicate that the Kuomintang government's violent "price controls" have placed Shanghai's private industry in a desperate situation. Under the "price controls," factories are unable to purchase raw materials, or must purchase them at high prices, while simultaneously being forced to sell their products at low prices. Factories are unable to withstand the losses and are preparing to shut down. However, Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, the so-called "Shanghai Economic Supervision Commissioner," is threatening to "take over" the factories, saying that "such a large China certainly has the strength to take over a few factories." His intention is to take advantage of this to completely swallow up the already-dying private industry. According to Shanghai's *Ta Kung Pao* on September 4th: on the 3rd, a representative symposium was held by various industrial trade unions in Shanghai, and the meeting was filled with complaints. Representatives from the printing industry stated: "Paper is nowhere to be found. On the surface, there are price controls, but in reality, the supply of raw materials depends on the black market. Since the 'currency reform,' black market paper prices have jumped from 25 yuan (pseudo-Gold Yuan Note - same below) to 30 yuan. The printing industry has no choice but to close down." Representatives from the steel smelting and canvas industries bitterly complained that the "price control order" forced factories in these two industries to buy expensively and sell cheaply, causing production to shrink and creating a shutdown crisis. Representatives from the woolen textile industry said: "Under the August 19th price controls, small and medium-sized factories have suffered the most. When price controls were implemented, there were no factory stocks and no fixed market prices for autumn and winter goods. At that time, in order to circulate funds, they sold orders at low prices. Now that prices are frozen, there is only a dead end."

　　国民党政府暴力“限价”　沪民营工业奄奄一息
    【新华社陕北三日电】综合各方消息：国民党政府的暴力“限价”，已使上海民营工业陷于绝境。在“限价”下，各业工厂一面无法买进原料，或须出高价买进原料；一面又被迫以低价出卖产品。工厂不堪亏蚀，准备停工，而所谓“沪区经济督导专员”蒋介石之子蒋经国却以“接管”工厂相威胁，说是“偌大中国岂无接办几个工厂之力量”，意图借此把原已奄奄一息的民营工业并吞罄尽。据九月四日沪大公报载：三日全沪各工业同业工会举行代表谈话会，会上一片叫苦声。印刷业代表称：“纸张到处买不到，表面上是限价，实际上原料供给仰赖黑市。自‘币改’后，黑市纸价已从二十五元（伪金圆券——下同）跳到三十元，印刷业只好关门停工。”钢铁炼制业及帆布业代表则痛陈“限价令”迫使该两业各工厂贵买贱卖，造成生产萎缩及停工危机。毛纺业代表说：“八、一九”限价下，中小工厂受害最惨，秋冬季用品在限价时既无厂盘，又无一定市价，当时为周转资金而低价抛售定货，现在物价冻结起来，只有死路一条了。
