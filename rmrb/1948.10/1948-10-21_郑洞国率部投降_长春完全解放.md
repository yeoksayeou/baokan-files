　　Zheng Dongguo Surrendered with His Troops
  　Changchun Completely Liberated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, Urgent Telegram, 24:00, 19th] The famous Northeast city of Changchun has been completely liberated today. Zheng Dongguo's New 7th Army and all Kuomintang armed forces were unwilling to resist and surrendered their arms to the People's Liberation Army. After Zeng Zesheng led the 60th Army to revolt on the 17th, he handed over the army's defense area in the city to the People's Liberation Army. Zheng Dongguo was also unwilling to fight any longer and sent people to negotiate surrender. Our side granted this, and the other side guaranteed not to damage weapons, property, or urban order. Our side agreed to treat its officers and civil servants leniently. As of the time of this telegram, Zheng's entire department had completed the group surrender. The people of the whole city are delighted with their rebirth, and cheers are deafening.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, Urgent Telegram, 01:00, 20th] The rapid liberation of Changchun is a direct result of the victory in Jinzhou. Changchun, which was once the capital of the puppet Manchukuo, was recovered by the Northeast People's Liberation Army from the puppet army Jiang Pengfei's department in April 1946, and then occupied by the Kuomintang army in May of the same year. Since the Northeast People's Liberation Army's winter offensive last year, Changchun has been surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, and the Kuomintang garrison in the city has been completely trapped in starvation and despair. Although the American aggressors and Chiang Kai-shek quarreled endlessly over whether to withdraw from Changchun and when to withdraw from Changchun, in fact, this withdrawal had long become a fantasy. It was not until the People's Liberation Army captured Jinzhou on the 15th of this month that Chiang Kai-shek, who had fled to Shenyang in a panic, sent a plane to Changchun to drop his "handwritten order," ordering the Kuomintang garrison to withdraw immediately. However, as early as the 14th, General Zeng Zesheng contacted the People's Liberation Army to implement the uprising and hand over defense affairs. As soon as Chiang bandit's withdrawal order arrived, the 60th Army led its troops in an uprising and withdrew from Changchun. The remaining Kuomintang troops were also willing to surrender rather than fight again, and a breakout was even more impossible. Zheng Dongguo, the highest Kuomintang commander in Changchun, "Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Suppression Headquarters" and alternate member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, led the First Army Corps directly subordinate units and all officers and soldiers of the New 7th Army to lay down their weapons yesterday. The New 7th Army was composed of the New 38th Division, originally under the New 1st Army, and two divisions of the Northeast puppet army. The surrender of Zheng Dongguo's department is the first time that the Kuomintang garrison troops have carried out a full surrender under the leadership of senior commanders. This is a symbol that the Chinese war situation has undergone tremendous changes and will continue to undergo even greater changes. Because of this, the liberation of Changchun not only accelerated the complete liberation of the Northeast, but also pointed out a future for all Kuomintang troops entrenched in large cities.

　　郑洞国率部投降
  　长春完全解放
    【新华社长春十九日二十四时急电】东北名城长春，今日已完全解放。郑洞国所部新七军及一切国民党武装力量，均已不愿抵抗，向解放军缴械投降。十七日曾泽生率领六十军起义后，即将该军市内防地交与解放军接管，郑洞国亦不愿再打，派人接洽投降事宜。当被我方允许，彼方保证不破坏武器、资财及城市秩序。我方允予宽待其军官文吏。至发电时止，郑部全体已集团缴械完毕。全城人民欣庆更生，欢声雷动。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    【新华社长春二十日一时急电】长春迅速解放，是锦州胜利的直接结果。曾经是伪满洲国首都的长春，系于一九四六年四月由东北人民解放军自伪军姜鹏飞部手中收复，又于同年五月被国民党军侵占者。自东北人民解放军去年冬季攻势以后，长春即被解放军所包围，市内国民党守军完全陷于饥饿和绝望状态。虽然，美国侵略者和蒋介石曾因是否撤退长春与何时撤退长春而吵闹不休，事实上这种撤退早已成为幻想。直至本月十五日解放军攻克锦州的时候，慌忙飞往沈阳的蒋介石才派飞机来长春投下他的“手令”，命令国民党守军立即撤退。但是早在十四日，曾泽生将军即和解放军接洽实行起义和交卸防务事宜。蒋匪撤退命令一到，六十军即率部起义，退出长春。其余国民党军队亦宁愿投降，不愿再打，突围更是不可能了。长春国民党最高指挥官“东北剿总副总司令”、国民党中央候补执行委员郑洞国，率领所部第一兵团直属机关部队与新七军全部官兵遂于昨日放下武器。新七军由原属新一军的新三十八师和东北伪军两个师编成。郑洞国部的投降，是国民党守城军队在高级指挥官率领下实行全体投降的第一次。这是中国战争形势已经发生了巨大变化并将继续发生更大变化的象征。因为这一点，长春的解放不但加速了东北的全部解放，而且给所有据守大城市的国民党军队指出了一个前途。
