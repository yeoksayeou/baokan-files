Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 29th. Political propaganda work has been used to assist military bandit suppression in counties such as Lushan and Linru in western Henan, with remarkable results. After the liberation of the Yuhuangmiao, Jizhong, and Qigan three villages in the Xiatang District of Lushan, mass work was once carried out. Jizhong was even divided into land. However, due to the counterattack organized by reactionary landlords and bandit collusion, the masses were harmed, and many young adults were hidden in the deep mountains. Our local armed forces then conducted door-to-door visits in groups and found that the masses did not dare to speak to us, "afraid that others would see and suffer in the future," or secretly asked, "Can comrades stand firm?" Soldiers and cadres immediately explained, specifically stating that the People's Liberation Army had gained a firm foothold in the Central Plains, and the bandits would soon be eliminated. They also helped them sweep the floor, chop firewood, and carry water. In less than three days, the young adults returned home one after another, but they were still skeptical about the propaganda of the unit. The unit then convened a mass meeting, first publicizing our victorious situation, exposing the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, explaining the connection between bandits and reactionaries, and that helping bandits was a violation of laws and a crime. Secondly, the policy towards bandits was announced: the chief culprits must be punished, those who were coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded; calling on people to register and hand over weapons. Third, it was announced that the farmers' vested interests would be resolutely protected, calling on landlords to abide by the law, not to reverse the land redistribution, and to implement rent reduction and interest reduction for those who have not been divided. The meeting was very successful. It not only suppressed bad elements and supported the general good villagers, but also clarified right and wrong for everyone and began to understand the government's policies. The common people responded very well after the meeting. Then, small-scale discussion meetings were held separately to conduct personal heart-to-heart talks, so that the masses dared to speak their minds. At the same time, a meeting of bandit family members was held to explain the advantages and disadvantages, urging them to call back their family members within a time limit. The surrenders were quickly released. Through this political offensive, the connection between the Party, the government, the army, and the masses was strengthened, and the internal wavering emotions of the bandits were increased. In ten days, the regimes of Yuhuangmiao and Jizhong villages were restored, and more than 30 scattered bandits were captured and won over. Yang Wenxian, the secretary of the bandit leader Xu Wanyi, was also called back by his wife.

Since the local bandit Li Qinglin's group was annihilated, the Linru Democratic Government went deep into the mountainous area of ​​Xiadian, where bandits were hidden, to establish a district government, and immediately convened a village cadre meeting to announce the government's determination to suppress bandits and appease the people; then, it convened a mass meeting of the entire district, explaining the government's lenient policy towards bandits, calling on bandits to go home to engage in production, and announcing that shooting black guns and killing people would not be allowed in the future, and murderers would pay for their lives. Within a week after the meeting, 31 bandits registered with the government. Therefore, the democratic government gathered the registrants for a meeting and repeatedly advised them to abandon evil and return to good and abide by the laws. At the meeting, everyone talked about the pain of being deceived and forced to become bandits and the painful life after becoming bandits, and discussed how to save other lost people. Within twelve days after the meeting, 62 more bandits in the district registered to start anew and handed over their weapons.

　　豫西清剿土匪
    联系群众进行政攻  感召土匪登记自新
    【新华社中原二十九日电】豫西鲁山、临汝等县用政治宣传工作协助军事剿匪，颇著成效。鲁山下汤区玉皇庙、鸡冢、旗杆三村解放后，曾一度进行过群众工作，鸡冢并分过土地后因反动地主结合伪匪组织反攻，群众受到残害，青壮年多隐藏深山。我地方武装乃分组进行挨户访问，发现群众不敢和我们说话，“怕别人看见将来吃亏”，或偷偷的问：“同志们站住站不住”，战士、干部即进行解释，具体说明解放军已在中原站稳了脚，土匪将很快被消灭。并帮他们扫地、打柴、担水。不到三天，青壮年即陆续回家，但对该部的宣传仍是半信半疑。该部乃召开群众大会，首先宣传我胜利形势，揭露蒋美罪恶，说明土匪与反动派的联系，帮助土匪就是违法犯罪。其次宣布对土匪的政策，首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受赏；号召登记交出枪支。第三，宣布坚决保护农民既得利益，号召地主守法，不准倒算，未分地者实行减租减息。大会开得很成功，不仅镇压了坏分子，给一般善良村民撑了腰，并使大家弄清了是非，开始懂得政府政策，会后，老百姓反映很好。接着又分别举行小型座谈会，进行个人谈心，使群众敢说心底话。同时召开土匪家属会议，阐明利害，促其限期叫回。对投诚者并迅速释放。经过这一政治攻势，密切了党、政、军与群众的联系，增加了土匪内部动摇情绪。十天中恢复了玉皇庙、鸡冢两个村政权，捕捉与争取散匪三十余名，匪首徐万一的秘书杨文宪亦经其妻子叫了回来。
    临汝民主政府自该地惯匪李庆林部被歼后，即深入窝藏土匪之山区夏店成立区政府，并即召开村干会议，宣布政府剿匪安民决心；接着又召开全区群众大会，阐明政府对土匪的宽大政策，号召土匪回家从事生产，宣布今后不准打黑枪，杀人者偿命。会后一周内土匪向政府登记者即有三十一人。于是民主政府又集合登记者开会，再三劝告他们改邪归正，遵守法令。会上，大家都诉说了被骗被迫及为匪后的痛苦生活情形，并讨论如何挽救其他失足者。会后十二天内全区又有六十二名土匪登记自新，并交出武器。
