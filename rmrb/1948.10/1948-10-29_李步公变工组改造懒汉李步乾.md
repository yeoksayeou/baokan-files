　　Li Bugong's Mutual Aid Team Transforms Loafer Li Buqian
    Zhuo Ping
  　Taking in the Loafer
    Li Bugong's mutual aid team is a relatively good one in Damaozhuang, Wulian County (newly established county), southeast coastal Shandong, and has persisted for seven or eight years. This year, when the village reorganized the mutual aid teams, it was felt that the group was too large, so it was divided into two smaller groups. The Bugong group had a total of four households, and Li Buqian joined later. This Li Buqian was a famous loafer, but he was still honest. His family of three generations only cultivated three *mu* of poor land. Since he was a child, he grazed cattle and watched the fields, not doing work in the fields, thus developing a lazy habit. After Damaozhuang was liberated in 1945, he joined the militia. Although he got back seven "middle *mu*" of land from the landlord, he still did not cultivate it properly, using "official business" as an excuse, asking people in the village to work for him. In 1946, he joined the army, and the following year he was discharged due to illness. He then joined the district armed work team, and the work on the slopes was still done by the mutual aid team, which everyone objected to. This year, the villagers, during the democratic review, removed him from his position, and the original mutual aid team kicked him out. Seeing the situation was not good, he was very anxious: "This year there is no other way, only working hard will prevent starvation!" So he decided to join his distant cousin Bugong's group. At that time, no one in the group wanted him, but after Bugong's persuasion, they agreed.
    Things Are Not Easy
    After Buqian joined the group, everyone made several rules: 1. He cannot be lazy when working, and no absenteeism is allowed; 2. Everything should be discussed democratically, with the minority submitting to the majority; 3. If there are shortcomings, he must first examine himself, and also accept everyone's criticism and earnestly correct himself; 4. Work points should be calculated and scored fairly and reasonably. Buqian agreed to all of these at the time. But things were not so easy. The first time the group assigned him work, he bargained: if he was asked to push a wheelbarrow, he said he couldn't push it; if he was asked to lead an ox to pull a plow, he said it was absurd. Later, he and the children's corps member Wan'er were assigned to pound manure for Li Zhu's family, but the sun was high and he still didn't go. Bugong called him before he went. He pounded a few times, then stopped to smoke, saying to Wan'er: "You young people are strong, do more, I am old, rest more." In fact, he was only thirty-four years old. Originally, one person could pound twenty carts a day, but he only pounded five carts in half a day, and he didn't go to work again in the afternoon. When scoring work points, he reported four points himself, but everyone scored him two points. Because it was his first time working, they did not criticize him. He complained that the points were too few, so everyone assigned him to dig the ground roots, and digging one *lao mu* of land could earn ten points. But he only dug three points of land in one morning, and didn't work in the afternoon, saying instead: "This job is not for me, I can't pull it." At this time, everyone in the group was angry, and Bugong was also a little impatient, saying to the township comrades: "There is no way to deal with this kind of person." At that time, the township branch tried its best to persuade Bugong's group to transform Li Buqian, and at the same time talked to Li Buqian, asking him to change. After several persuasions, both parties were convinced.
    Methods of Transformation
    After the group decided to transform Li Buqian, they used these three methods.
    The first is to specifically help him solve difficulties, while giving him strict supervision and criticism.
    When transplanting sweet potato seedlings, the whole group, based on experience, was busy transplanting early, but Buqian always said: "It's still early, there are many families that haven't transplanted yet, it's not just me who is behind." But the group did not let up; seeing that he had no money to buy sweet potato seedlings, they lent him some to plant first. Later, there was a drought, and some of the land in the village was so dry that it couldn't be planted, but Buqian's sweet potatoes had already grown a foot long. He was very grateful to the group.
    The cabbage planted in Buqian's yard was so dry that the ground was cracked. When Bugong asked him to tell his wife to carry water to water the vegetables, Buqian said he was afraid his wife wouldn't listen. Bugong said: "As long as you take the lead, she won't dare not listen." Later, the cabbage grew a foot high, and the couple happily said: "Thanks to Bugong's good idea, which helped us get through the spring famine."
    But Buqian's nature was not easy to change, and he always wanted to be lazy. One day it rained, and it was noon, but Buqian was still sleeping on the *kang*. Bugong put down his work to urge him, telling him that rainy days have rainy day work, and he should take advantage of the rain to replant sorghum seedlings. But when he went to the field and saw that there was not enough rainwater, and he also felt it was too much trouble to carry water, he ran back. After the rain, Bugong saw that he had not replanted the seedlings, and he was very angry. He severely criticized him in the group meeting together with everyone.
    When hoeing the ground together, Buqian could never keep up. Everyone criticized him on the slope, asking him to compete with Wan'er. He himself felt ashamed, so he hoed tightly; but upon inspection, the ground he hoed was "cat shit covered" (not clean). Although Bugong taught him while working, he was good for a few days, then bad again. Everyone did not let up on criticizing him. At the same time, Bugong often used the spirit of self-examination to influence him to humbly accept criticism. Once, the group meeting criticized him very fiercely: "You have no conscience, others are kind to you, but you hoe 'cat shit covered'. The Communist Party loves laboring people, if you can't produce anything, everyone can help, but if a loafer starves to death, no one will be sad." At that time, he felt like his heart was on fire from the criticism, but afterwards, he also felt that he was too lazy, so he decided to correct himself.
    The second is to sincerely take care of his life. During the busiest time of spring plowing, he was the most difficult, with nothing to eat. The group decided that everyone would eat their own food when working for him, and also distributed relief grain to him twice, and would go to see if he had anything to eat every few days. This kind of care gave Li Buqian a great spiritual comfort and encouragement.
    The third is to use work points and accounting to stimulate Buqian's production enthusiasm. Once, when scoring sorghum seedling hoeing, he wanted six points, but everyone gave him ten points to encourage him. Seeing that he had made progress, he gained more confidence. But sometimes the scoring was very strict, stimulating him to work harder. After the wheat harvest, the group calculated the accounts, and only Buqian still owed one hundred and forty-eight work points, which required finding seventy-four *jin* of wheat, but he had no wheat, so he had to pay it back in the autumn, one *jin* of wheat for two *jin* of sorghum, a total of one hundred and forty-eight *jin* of autumn grain. Bugong calculated the detailed accounts for him, and said: "There will be a lot of work in the future, if you work like this, you will still have to find more work outside, and the grain you harvest will not be enough to pay for it." This calculation worried him. So he said at the group meeting: he was determined to start working hard and slowly make up for the owed work points. Bugong used a method of tightening first and then loosening on him: first using accounting to force him and stimulate him, and then, when he was aware and corrected himself, loosening up a step to help him.
    Beginning to Change
    After these methods, Buqian really changed. He went to the field early in the morning and worked very seriously, and he could also humbly accept everyone's criticism. When hoeing the first crop of beans, he not only hoed his own land well, but also helped the group hoe, making up for twelve work points. His wife never went to the slope to look at the crops, but this year, because the crops were good, she also went to the field to see. She happily said: "My child's grandpa joined the mutual aid team, and his laziness has been cured."

　　李步公变工组改造懒汉李步乾
    卓萍
  　收留下懒汉
    李步公变工组是山东东南滨海五莲县（新设县）大毛庄较好的变工组，坚持七、八年了。今年村里整理变工组时，感到组太大，分成了两个小组。步公组共四户，以后才加入了李步乾。这李步乾是个出名懒汉，但人还老实。他家祖孙三代，只种三分薄地，他自小放牛、看岭，不做地里活，因此养成懒惰习惯。一九四五年大毛庄解放后，他参加了民兵，虽向地主算回了七“中亩”地，但仍不好好种，借口“办公”，要庄里人替他干活。一九四六年他参军，第二年因病退伍，又参加区武工队，坡里活还是靠变工组做，大家都有意见。今年庄里老百姓在民主检查中撤了他的职，原来的变工组又把他赶了，他看势头不对，心里怪急：“今年没有别的道路，只有下坡干活才饿不死！”于是决定投他远房弟兄步公的这一组。当时组里人都不愿要他，经过步公劝说，才答应了。
    事情不容易
    步乾入组后，大家订了几条规矩：一、干活不能偷懒，不准旷工；二、凡事民主讨论，少数服从多数；三、有缺点要自己先检讨，还要接受大家批评认真改正；四、公平合理计工评分。步乾当时都应承了。但事情并不如此容易。组里第一次分配他干活时，他就讨价还价：要他推小车，他说推不动，叫他牵牛拉犁，他说不象话。后来分配他和儿童团的湾儿给李朱氏家捣粪，但太阳很高他还不去，步公叫了他才去。他去捣了几下，就歇下抽起烟来，对湾儿说：“你们年青力壮，多做些，俺老年团了，多歇歇。”其实，他不过三十四岁。本来一人一天可捣二十车，他半天里只捣五车，下午就又不去干了。评分时他自报四分工，大家评了二分，因为是第一次干活，也没有批评他。他嫌分少，大家分配他打地骨录，打一老亩地可挣十分。但一上午他只打了三分地，下午又不干了，反说：“这营生不是俺干的，拉不动。”这时组里人都生气了，步公也有点不耐烦，向乡里同志说：“这样的人没法治。”当时乡支部竭力说服步公组改造李步乾，同时找李步乾谈话，要他转变。经过几番劝说，才把双方都说通了。
    改造的办法
    组里决心改造李步乾以后，用了这样三种办法。
    第一是具体帮助他解决困难，同时给他严格的督促和批评。
    秧地瓜时，全组根据经验都忙着早秧，唯有步乾总是说：“还早啦，没秧的人家多着哩，不是俺一个人落后。”但组里人还是不放松；见他没钱买地瓜芽，就借给他先种上。后来天旱了，村里有的地干得种不下去，但步乾的地瓜已长得一尺长了，他对组里很感激。
    步乾院里种的白菜，地干得都裂了缝。步公要他叫老婆挑水浇菜时，步乾说怕老婆不听话。步公说：“只要你领着头干，她就不敢不听话。”后来白菜长得一尺高，两口子喜着说：“亏得步公的主意打得好，使咱渡过了春荒。”
    但步乾性情不易改，总想偷懒。一天下雨，天晌午了，步乾还在炕上困觉。步公放下活来督促他，告诉他雨天有雨天的营生，应该趁下雨去补秫秫苗。但他到地里一看，雨水不够，又嫌挑水费劲，就跑了回来。过了雨天，步公见他未补苗子，心里很生气，在小组会上和大家一起重重批评了他一顿。
    一起锄地时，步乾总是赶不上趟。大家在坡里批评他，叫他和湾儿比。他自己觉得丢脸，就紧着锄；但一检查，他锄的却是“猫盖屎”（不干净）。步公虽一面干活，一面教他，但他好了几天，就又坏了，大家不放松对他的批评，同时步公常用自我检讨的精神，来影响他虚心接受批评。有一次小组会批评他很凶：“没良心，别人好心对你，你给人锄个‘猫盖屎’。共产党爱劳动人，劳动不出东西来，众人能帮助，懒汉饿死了，没人伤心的。”当时批评得他心里火烧，但过后，他也觉得自己太懒，于是决心改正。
    第二是诚意照顾他的生活。春耕最忙时，他最困难，没吃的，小组决定给他干活时各吃各的，并发给他两次救济粮，过几天就去看看他有没有吃的。这种关心给李步乾精神上一个极大的安慰和鼓励。
    第三是用计工算帐，刺激步乾的生产情绪。有一次秫秫锄苗评分时，他要六分，大家为鼓励他，评了他十分工。他看见自己进步了，更增加了信心。但有时也评得很严，刺激他再下劲干。麦后组里一算帐，只有步乾还欠一百四十八分工，要找出麦子七十四斤，但他没有麦子，到秋季还，一斤麦子还二斤秫秫，共要还一百四十八斤秋粮才行。步公就给他算细帐，并说：“以后活还很多，照你这样干活，还得往外找，打下粮食还不够找的。”这一算，他发愁了。于是他在小组会上表示：决心开始下力干，把欠的工票慢慢顶回来。步公对他用了先紧后松的办法：先用算帐来紧逼他，刺激他，等他觉悟了，改正了，再放宽一步来帮助他。
    开始转变了
    经过这些办法，步乾真的转变了，一早上地，干得很认真，对大家的批评也能虚心接受了。锄头遍豆子时，他除锄好了自己的地，还帮组里锄，顶回了十二分工票。他老婆从不上坡看庄稼，今年因庄稼好，她也上地去看。她高兴地说：“俺小孩他爷投了变工组，懒病也治好了。”
