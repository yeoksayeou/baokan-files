Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Reports from various sources: Amidst the sound of Shigeru Yoshida, president of the Japanese Democratic Liberal Party, forming a cabinet, the organized labor movement in Japan is increasingly growing in opposition. Thousands of Japanese workers marched and demonstrated on the streets of Tokyo on the afternoon of the 18th. The demonstrators held banners reading "Oppose the Amendment of the Civil Servant Law," "Demand Wage Increases," "Issue Winter Allowances," and "Abolish Income Tax on Workers' Income." According to a TASS report on the 17th, the chairman of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, Tsuchihashi, declared that even the trade unions of private enterprises "will not support the Yoshida cabinet. Nothing beneficial to workers can be expected from such a cabinet." Tsuchihashi advocated that socialists must now cooperate with communists in order to consolidate democratic forces. Vice Chairman Komizo of the General Federation of Labor Unions declared that the General Federation opposes any conservative cabinet, especially one composed of representatives of the Democratic Liberal Party, "The General Federation must wage a resolute struggle against the reactionary Yoshida cabinet, especially if the cabinet attempts to amend labor laws to make them worse or freeze wages." The National Congress of Metal Workers' Trade Unions and Machinery Manufacturing Workers' Trade Unions, which convened in Osaka with the aim of establishing an All-Japan Metal Workers' Union, unanimously passed a resolution: Resolutely oppose the Yoshida cabinet and any other reactionary conservative cabinet. After Yoshida was barely elected in the Japanese Diet on the 14th with a weak majority, received approval from his Emperor, and visited MacArthur on the 16th, he was still gathering his team as of the 18th. A message from Tokyo: Yoshida's election foreshadows that the new cabinet will be a short-lived one, possibly lasting no more than one or two months.

　　日工人反对吉田组阁
  　吉田以贫弱多数勉强获选预示新阁将为一短命内阁
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方报导：在日本民主自由党总裁吉田茂组阁声中，日本有组织的工人正日益增长反对的运动。数以千计的日本工人于十八日下午在东京大街上游行示威。示威者手执“反对修改公务员法”，“要求提高工资”，“发给冬季津贴”，“废除对工人收入课所得税”等标语。据塔斯社十七日消息：全日递信工人工会主席土桥宣称：甚至私营企业的职工会也“将不支持吉田内阁。从这样的内阁，指望不到会有什么对工人有利的政策。”土桥主张社会党人现在必须与共产党人合作，以便巩固民主力量。劳动组合总同盟副主席小沟宣称：总同盟反对任何保守内阁，特别是由民主自由党代表组成的内阁，“总同盟必须对反动的吉田内阁进行坚决斗争，特别是假如该内阁企图修改劳工法，使之变得更坏，或冻结工资的话”。旨在成立全日五金工人工会而在大坂集会的五金工人职工会与机器制造业工人职工会的全国代表大会，一致通过决议：坚决反对吉田内阁与任何其他反动的保守内阁。按吉田自在十四日日本议会中以贫弱多数票勉强获选后，经其天皇批准并于十六日访麦克阿瑟，迄十八日止，还在凑集班子。东京方面消息：吉田茂之获选，预示新阁将为一短命内阁，其寿命可能不逾一二月。
