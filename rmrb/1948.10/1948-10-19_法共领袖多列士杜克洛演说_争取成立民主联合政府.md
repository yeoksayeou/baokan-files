　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS reports that French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez and French Communist Party parliamentary group leader Duclos have delivered successive speeches, emphasizing that France should form a democratic coalition government. In a mass rally in Poissy, near Paris, on the 12th, Thorez stated that at a time when the lives of the working class are deteriorating, the excessive profits of capitalists have reached a shameful level. Thorez said that Queuille claimed the miners' strike cost France 600 million francs a day, but the workers' monthly wage increase demand was only 500 million francs. The losses from one day of the strike would be more than enough to meet the workers' monthly demands. Thorez pointed out that in the workers' struggle to achieve their basic demands, the unity of the working people and the unity of all honest French people are being strengthened. Thorez emphasized the need for France to form a democratic coalition government, the program principles of which should be: to defend the interests of the French people, to establish a democratic tax system, to demand German reparations to France, to stop the Vietnam War and abolish colonial oppression, and to defend the Franco-Soviet alliance, which constitutes a permanent guarantee of France's security. The previous day, Duclos, in a mass rally of 20,000 people in Nîmes, northwest of Marseille, condemned the French ruling class for abandoning the right to demand reparations from Germany because it listened to Marshall's demand that France and Germany unite to confront the Soviet Union. Duclos stressed: But the French people will never again fight against our great Eastern ally, and the French people will strive through united action to establish a democratic coalition government.

　　法共领袖多列士杜克洛演说
  　争取成立民主联合政府
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社报导：法共总书记多列士与法共议会党团领袖杜克洛，接连发表演说，强调法国应组成民主的联合政府。多列士于十二日在巴黎附近之波赛城群众大会上发表演说称，在工人阶级生活更趋恶化的时候，资本家的超额利润之高，已达到可耻的水平。多列士称，葛义声言矿工罢工使法国每日损失六亿法郎，但是，工人们一个月的增资要求却只不过五亿法郎。以罢工一日的损失，就足以满足工人们一个月的要求而有余。多列士指出，在工人争取其基本要求实现的斗争过程中，劳动人民的团结与一切诚实的法国人民的团结正在增强起来。多列士强调法国有组成民主联合政府的必要，这一政府的纲领原则应当是：保卫法国人民利益，建立民主税收制度，索取德国对法赔偿，停止越南战争和取消殖民地压迫，并保卫构成法国安全之永久保证的法苏同盟。前一日，杜克洛在马赛西北尼姆城对二万人的群众大会发表演说，谴责法国统治阶级因为听从马歇尔要求法国和德国联合起来对抗苏联的意志，已放弃了对德国要求赔偿的权利。杜克洛强调指出：但法国人民将永远不再和我们伟大的东方盟国作战，法国人民将以联合行动争取成立民主的联合政府。
