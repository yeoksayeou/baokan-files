　　Taking the Road of "The Union is Good"
    Harbin Holds Literary and Art Symposium

    The Propaganda Department of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee invited literary and art workers in Harbin to a symposium on September 9th to strengthen and unify the city's literary and art work. At the meeting, Zhang Chengmin, Minister of Propaganda of the Trade Union Federation, and Zhang Fanfu, head of the Cultural Troupe of the Literary Association, successively introduced the workers' urgent need for literature and art, especially literature and art reflecting workers' lives. The participating literary and art workers also focused on reviewing their past failure to earnestly implement the policy of serving the workers in their speeches. For example, some literary and art workers often said "serving the workers" but when the workers really came to ask for help with rehearsing plays and teaching songs, they refused because they were busy. Sometimes, in order to collect materials, they would stay in the factory for ten days or half a month, but did not help the factory's literary and artistic activities. They would then shut themselves in their rooms to write, sometimes not producing a script for several months, and even when they did, it didn't resemble the workers. Comrade Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, pointed out in his speech that there are two key points for developing Harbin's literature and art in the future: first, how to concretize Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line in Harbin. Because Harbin's economic conditions are different from those in rural areas, simply copying the old methods from rural areas is not suitable for the actual needs. In the city, it is necessary to especially emphasize that literature and art should serve the workers. However, our literary and art workers are still very unfamiliar with the workers' lives, feelings, and will. Without solving this problem, it will be impossible to truly integrate literature and art with the working masses. Second, Harbin's literary and artistic work should be more organized and planned to meet the needs of current political, economic, and military developments. If anarchy still exists in culture and literature and art, we should resolutely strive to overcome it. At the meeting, it was unanimously agreed that in the future, we should take the road of the drama "The Union is Good" to make literature and art more closely integrated with the working masses. The drama "The Union is Good" was written by Harbin workers based on the fact that a rogue worker in the Shuanghesheng Flour Mill in the city was transformed into a labor hero. After its performance, it was well received by all parties. The play was written, directed, and performed by the workers themselves, with the help of trade union workers and art workers. It is a collective work combining the three parties.

　　走“工会好”的道路
    哈尔滨开文艺座谈会
    哈尔滨市委宣传部，于九月九日邀请在哈文艺工作者座谈，以加强与统一哈市文艺工作。会上，总工会宣传部长张承民，文协文工团团长张凡夫，先后介绍了工人迫切需要文艺，特别是反映工人生活的文艺的情况。与会的文艺工作者在发言中也着重检讨自己过去没有切实实行为工人服务的方针，如有的文艺工作者嘴上常说“为工人服务”，但当工人真来要求帮助排戏、教歌时，却说自己忙而拒绝；有时为了收集材料，也到工厂去住十天半月，但对工厂的文艺活动并没有帮助：回来就关在屋子里写，有时几个月也写不出一个剧本，写出来也不象工人。中共市委书记张平化同志在发言中指出：今后开展哈市文艺的关键有二：第一是如何把毛主席的文艺方针在哈市具体化。由于哈市的经济条件与农村不同，硬搬农村中的老一套是不适合实际需要的。在城市里，应特别强调文艺为工人服务。但我们的文艺工作者，对工人的生活、感情与意志还非常不熟悉。不解决这问题，就不可能真正使文艺与工人群众相结合。第二，哈市文艺工作应更有组织性与计划性，以适应目前政治、经济、军事发展的需要。在文化上、文艺上如果还存在无政府状态，就应坚决努力去克服它。会上，一致认为今后要走戏剧“工会好”的道路，使文艺更和工人群众密切结合。按“工会好”一剧系哈尔滨工人以该市双合盛面粉厂一个二流子工人转变为劳动英雄的事实所编写，上演后甚得各方好评。该剧由工人自编、自导、自演，并有工会工作者和艺术工作者的帮助，是三方面结合起来的集体剧作。
