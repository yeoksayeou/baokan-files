　　Japanese Bureaucrats, Politicians, and Big Capitalists: Corruption Scandals Continue to be Exposed
  　Yoshida Also Implicated in Another Scandal
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th] According to a report from the Tokyo correspondent of the Dentsu News Agency, corruption scandals involving bribery among Japanese bureaucrats, politicians, and big capitalists continue to be exposed, and have even implicated personnel within MacArthur's headquarters. MacArthur is attempting to cover up his already established bribery offenses, directly ordering Japanese authorities to cease investigation of the Showa scandal. Investigative records were submitted to the Tokyo Military Police headquarters. While the Showa case remains unresolved, a coal mine corruption scandal has recently been discovered, implicating new Prime Minister Yoshida. It is claimed that Yoshida received a large bribe from a coal mine capitalist, which he distributed to members of the Liberal Democratic Party in the Diet. It is reported that when the Diet discussed the Coal Mine National Control Bill last November, coal mine owners bribed Diet members to prevent the Diet from passing the bill. According to the Tokyo Prosecutor's Office, most of those who accepted bribes were members of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Democratic Party.

　　日本官僚政客大资本家 　 舞弊丑案继续暴露
  　吉田也牵涉在另一舞弊案中
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据电通社东京记者报导，日本官僚致客大资本家受贿舞弊的丑案继续暴露，并已牵涉麦克阿瑟总部人员在内。麦克阿瑟力图掩盖其已被判明的受贿劣迹，直接命令日本当局停止对昭和丑案的侦查。侦查记录被提交东京美宪兵总部。在昭和案尚未了结之际，近又发现一煤矿舞弊案，新首相吉田也牵连在内。据称，吉田曾接煤矿资本家的巨额贿赂，分发给民主自由党众议员。按去年十一月议会讨论煤矿国家管制法案时，煤矿主曾贿赂议员阻止议会通过该案，据东京检察处表示，受贿者多为民主自由党及民主党议员。
