Xinhua News Agency, North China, 7th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented that the recovery of Heze, a major town in southwestern Shandong Province and one of the few remaining strongholds of the Kuomintang in Shandong Province, was a result of the Jinan Victory. When forced to admit the fall of Jinan, the Kuomintang's Central News Agency fabricated the story that "the fall of Jinan is only the prelude to the Battle of Central Shandong, and the National Army is now advancing towards Central Shandong in separate routes according to the predetermined plan." Facts have shown that the Central News Agency has once again lost its way: the Kuomintang's "predetermined plan" was not to advance north but to flee south. In addition to feeling the military pressure from the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang's escape from Heze also had political reasons. Cao Fulin's troops, who defended Heze, and General Wu Huawen, who revolted in Jinan this time, were both former subordinates of the Northwest Army. The Kuomintang headquarters in Xuzhou, increasingly suspicious and fearful of the Northwest Army and other miscellaneous troops, hastily decided to concentrate Cao's troops from the prominent and dangerous area to the Longhai Railway, which was easier for Chiang Kai-shek's direct line to control.

### 菏泽城的收复是济南大捷结果

　　菏泽城的收复是济南大捷结果
    【新华社华北七日电】新华社记者评称：国民党在山东省境残留的少数据点之一——山东省西南部重镇菏泽的收复，是济南大捷的结果。国民党中央社在被迫承认济南失守时，曾捏造说“此次济南失陷仅系鲁中大战之序幕，刻国军正按预定计划分途向鲁中进攻中”。事实表明中央社又一次迷失了方向：国民党的“预定计划”不是北进而是南逃。国民党逃出菏泽除了因为感受解放军的军事压力以外，还有政治的原因。菏泽守敌曹福林部与此次在济南起义的吴化文将军同为西北军旧部。对于西北军和其他杂牌军日益增加的怀疑和恐惧，使徐州的国民党总部仓皇地决定把曹部从突出的危险地带集中到蒋介石嫡系较易控制的陇海路上来。
