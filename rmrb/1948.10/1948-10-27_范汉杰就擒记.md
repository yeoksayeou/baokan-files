Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou Front, 25th.

    On the morning of the sixteenth, on a small road about twenty li southeast of Jinzhou city, four middle-aged men and women dressed in black were walking along. One of them was tall and sturdy, wearing a tattered felt hat, a torn cotton-padded coat showing the cotton wadding, and mismatched small cotton trousers. He had a tattered sack draped over his shoulders and was gnawing on a turnip.
    At that time, the enemy prisoner processing office of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was stationed in the village. When these four suspiciously behaving "civilians" were discovered, our staff began to question them. A woman with a Fujian accent repeatedly interrupted to answer, while the other two men pretended to be very tired, sighing and shaking their heads. The tall man lowered his voice, saying that he was a bookkeeper from a clock shop in Shenyang, who had fled Shenyang and was preparing to return to his hometown in Fujian. He always pulled his tattered felt hat down, covering half of his face, avoiding people's gazes. However, his very unnatural attire and movements, his white hands and teeth, and the Cantonese accent audible in his low voice, all put a question mark on this so-called "Shenyang refugee."
    When questioning their relationship with each other, the tall man was unable to explain clearly. After hesitating for a long time, he said: "I have nothing to say, you can shoot me."
    So they were detained. During interrogation, their answers were full of loopholes. The woman spoke nonsense, and the other two confessed to being a "lieutenant-level clerk" and a "orderly". The tall man said nothing. When the People's Liberation Army medic applied medicine to the scratches on his forehead, he said very seriously: "Please use some alcohol, I'm afraid I'll get tetanus."
    The next morning, the one who confessed to being a "lieutenant-level clerk" told the soldiers guarding them that he had something to tell the interrogators. When the interrogators met him, he repeatedly said: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, after your repeated explanations of the policy on prisoners of war, I still haven't told the truth. I am Fan Hanjie's adjutant, and that tall man is Fan Hanjie."
    "Fan Hanjie, from Guangdong, forty-two years old, tall, dark-faced and bald." - This was the image that our Jinzhou front troops were familiar with, and it was exactly the same as this tall man in the torn cotton-padded coat.

　　范汉杰就擒记
    十六日上午，在距锦州城东南二十余里的谷家窝棚东面的小道上，走来了四个着黑色服装的中年男女。其中一个高大个儿，头戴烂毡帽，身穿一件露出棉絮的破棉袄和一条极不相称的小棉裤，肩上披着一条破麻袋，手里拿着一个萝葡在啃着。
    其时，解放军某部处理敌俘的机关正驻札该屯。当发现了这四个形迹可疑的“百姓”时，我工作人员就开始盘问他们。四个人中一个操福建口音的女人屡次抢着答话，另两个男的装着很累的样子，唉声叹气地摇着头。高大个儿则压低着声音，说他是沈阳一家钟表店的记帐的，从沈阳逃难出来，准备回福建老家去。他总是把破毡帽向下拉，遮住半个脸，避开人们的视线。但是他的很不自然的装束和动作，两只白白的手和牙齿，低音里仍听得出来的广东口腔，这些都给这位所谓“沈阳难民”划下了一个问号。
    当开始盘问他们四个人之间的关系时，高大个儿无法交待清楚。他迟疑了好一会后，说：“我没话可谈了，你们枪毙我吧。”
    于是他们被扣押起来。在进行审讯时，他们的答话漏洞百出。女的乱说一通，另两个自供是：“尉官司书”和“勤务兵”。高大个儿则什么也不说。当解放军的卫生员给他的擦伤了的额头上药时，他却很认真地说：“擦些酒精吧，恐怕会得破伤风。”
    翌晨，那自供是“尉官司书”的对看守他们的战士说，他有一件事情要告诉审讯人员。当审讯人员接见他时，他连说：“对不起，对不起，经过了你们多次解释俘虏政策，我还没说实话。我就是范汉杰的侍从副官，那高大个儿就是范汉杰。”
    “范汉杰，广东人，年四十二岁，高大个子，面黑秃头。”——这是我锦州前线部队所熟记的形象，和这个穿着破棉袄的高大个儿一点也不差。
