Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th. The Northwest People's Liberation Army seized a "top secret" order from Hu Zongnan to his subordinate, He Wending, commander of the 17th Division, dated August 21, 1947, regarding the implementation of "fake surrender" measures. This "fake surrender" implementation method was formulated "based on instructions from the commander-in-chief (Chiang Kai-shek)" and according to "item 3 of the precautions for troop news work (i.e., secret service work in Kuomintang troops)." The main points of this method are as follows: (1) "The fake surrender work is carried out by the regiment as a unit, with each regiment commander and regiment news office director being responsible for implementation under the command of superior officers and political work officers." (2) "The fake surrender work should be carried out in extreme secrecy, and those not directly involved should not be informed." (3) Preparations before implementation: "Select loyal and reliable officers above the rank of platoon leader and non-commissioned officers" as "fake surrender" personnel. "Take the regiment as a unit, three to five people as a group, group training (each group does not have horizontal relations, so as not to be implicated)." Training content: "Mainly focus on work skills." (4) Timing and method of fake surrender: "When the battle is lost, each fake surrender group is thrown into the bandit army"; or "engage in a brief skirmish and retreat, deliberately sending the surrender team to be captured by the bandits"; or "deliberately fall behind and hide among the people while marching, and be searched and captured by the bandits"; or "fabricate suitable reasons to allow the fake surrender personnel to escape and surrender to the bandit army." (5) Work tasks of fake surrender personnel: Deliberately "express loyalty and diligence in order to gain trust, and use various relationships to try to get close to the responsible personnel of the bandit army." "Sow discord between officers and soldiers," "secretly contact officers and soldiers who have been captured or falsely surrendered, and act when the opportunity arises." Once "the time is ripe, use various situations to carry out sabotage"; or, when "the war is fierce, lead the personnel who have been successfully contacted to revolt"; or "find opportunities to sabotage important positions and important military facilities of the bandit army"; or "assassinate important leaders of the bandit army"; or "obtain important intelligence" and escape back to the enemy army; or "seek opportunities to riot, mutiny, and coerce the masses" to escape back to the enemy army; or "rescue captured officers" to escape back to the enemy army.

The above-mentioned despicable conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek was produced under the conditions that his military was failing repeatedly, his soldiers had no fighting spirit, and tens of thousands of officers and soldiers laid down their weapons on the battlefield, and he had no ability to reverse this military decline. Although this conspiracy cannot save his military crisis in the slightest, it is worthy of the vigilance of the commanders of the People's Liberation Army.

　　蒋匪连打败仗玩弄阴谋
    密令“假投降”伺机破坏
    【新华社西北三十日电】西北解放军缴获胡匪宗南一九四七年八月二十一日给他的部下十七师师长何文鼎实施“假投降”办法“极机密”的命令一件。该“假投降”实施办法系“依据统帅（蒋贼）指示”并根据“部队新闻工作（即国民党部队中的特务工作）注意事项第三项”订定的。该办法要点如下：（一）“假投降工作以团为单位，由各团长、团新闻室主任受上级部队长官暨政工主官之指挥，负责实施”。（二）“假投降工作进行时应极端秘密，非直接参加工作人员勿使得知”。（三）实施前之准备：“选拔忠实可靠之排长以上之军官与军士”为“假投降”人员。“以团为单位，三至五人为一组，分组训练（各组不发生横的关系，以免牵连）”。训练内容：“以工作技术为主”。（四）假投降之时机与方式：“在作战失利时，使假投降每组投入匪军”；或“交绥而退，故遣投降小组被匪俘虏”；或“行军时故意落伍隐藏民间，被匪搜获”；或“捏造适宜理由，使假降人员逃亡，降入匪军”。（五）假降人员之工作任务：故意“表示忠诚勤劳，以便取得信任，利用各种关系设法与匪军负责人员接近”。“离间官兵感情”，“秘密联络被匪俘获或假投降官兵，伺机而动。”一俟“时机成熟，即利用各种情势，进行破坏”；或当“战事激烈时，带领已被联络成功之人员倒戈”；或“伺机破坏匪军重要阵地及重要军事设备”；或“暗杀匪军重要负责人”；或“取得重要情报”后逃归敌军；或“伺机暴动、叛变、胁众”逃归敌军；或“营救被俘长官”逃归敌军。
    上述蒋介石这种卑劣阴谋，是在其军事上节节失败，士无斗志，成千成万官兵在战场上放下武器而自己又无能力挽回这种军事颓势的条件下产生的。这种阴谋虽然丝毫不能挽救其军事危机，却是值得人民解放军的指挥员的警惕。
