　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 4th Dispatch】 Fu Zuoyi's bandit troops’ long snake formation, extending from western Suiyuan to eastern Hebei, is now facing a dangerous situation of being attacked everywhere. While Bandit Fu was hurriedly gathering troops to rescue his old nest of Gui Sui from crisis, a unit of the People's Liberation Army suddenly launched an attack on the Chahar East area near his heartland of Zhangjiakou. On September 28th, they captured Zhao Chuan Fort, 60 miles northeast of Xuanhua, and other important strongholds nearby such as Shuang Mao Fort, annihilating all the defending enemies. The number of enemy prisoners alone reached over a thousand. Detailed battle results are still being tallied. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army recovered Tuchengzi, southwest of Kangbao in northern Chahar, on September 25th; Dagouqing in Shangyi on September 26th; and Nanhedian on September 27th, killing and capturing about a hundred enemies and seizing four cars, among other things.
    【North Yue News】 (Delayed) A battalion of the 21st Security Regiment of Bandit Fu's troops stationed in Gushan Village, north of Datong, invaded Zhenbian Fort on the 22nd to seize grain. While en route, they encountered a unit of our local troops in Sandunzi Village. Our troops immediately took preemptive action, launching a swift and courageous attack on the enemy. After a fierce battle lasting over an hour, most of the bandits were annihilated. The remaining enemies, unable to withstand the attack, fled in panic. In total, we killed or wounded over 70 bandits, including a company commander, and captured 119 bandits, including a company commander and platoon leader. We also seized three light machine guns, three grenade launchers, one spigot mortar, ninety-six rifles, one submachine gun, forty-seven bayonets, one machine gun magazine, thousands of rounds of ammunition, forty-one hand grenades, and seven mortar shells and spigot mortar rounds each.
