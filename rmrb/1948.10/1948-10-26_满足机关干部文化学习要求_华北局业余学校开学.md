　　To Meet the Cultural Learning Needs of Government Cadres
　　North China Bureau Spare-time School Opens
　　[Report from this newspaper] The North China Bureau's spare-time cultural school for government staff has officially begun classes on the 14th of this month, after more than half a month of preparation. When the preparation began, many cadres expressed hope that the school would open soon during the cultural level survey, and more than sixty people enthusiastically signed up to participate. Some comrades who were away on official business could not register early, but they continued to increase in number afterward, reaching eighty-two people by the 18th. The enthusiasm for learning is very high. Every time before class, they gather in the classroom very early to preview the material. They also listen attentively during lectures without any slackening. Many comrades squeeze in time to review after class. Some comrades who miss class due to work make up for it afterward. Everyone studies very conscientiously. The majority of students are clerical staff, transportation staff, and printing staff. Most students have a cultural level below middle school, but above primary school. Generally, they lack self-study ability, or their self-study ability is low. However, they have experience and their comprehension is not low.
　　The school's curriculum is divided into three subjects: Chinese language, arithmetic, and the history of social development. Chinese language and arithmetic are each divided into advanced and elementary levels. Students choose according to their own level. Some are at the advanced level in Chinese language and the elementary level in arithmetic, while others are at the advanced level in arithmetic and the elementary level in Chinese language. This is entirely based on their own level to avoid being too high or too low, which would make learning inconvenient. Each subject has two collective classes per week. Students must abide by the learning rules and cannot be absent from class without reason. If they have something to do and cannot attend class, they must ask for leave. The textbooks used are the middle school textbooks published by Xinhua Bookstore and A Brief History of Social Development. Teachers are selected from among the government staff. Each person teaches one subject, teaching twice a week, and is given remuneration according to the amount of time they teach. The funds needed for the school are the responsibility of the government.
　　The school is tentatively set for a six-month term. Each term completes a certain course. For example, the advanced arithmetic class will start with algebra and complete all of arithmetic in the first six months; the elementary arithmetic class will start with integers and complete fractions in the first six months. After the first term is completed, a second term will continue to further improve and gradually increase the study of other subjects.

　　满足机关干部文化学习要求
  　华北局业余学校开学
    【本报讯】华北局机关业余文化学校，经半个多月筹备，已于本月十四日正式上课。在筹备开始，进行文化程度调查时，就有很多干部希望能很快开学，并有六十余人踊跃报名，要求参加。有的同志因公在外不能及早报名，以后陆续增加，至十八日已达八十二人。学习情绪很高。每次上课时间，很早都集合到课堂上预习。讲课时也都专心静听，没有半点松懈。有很多同志下课后挤时间复习。有的同志因工作误了课，回来就补习。学习都非常认真。学习的以事务工作干部、交通工作干部、文印工作干部为最多。学生文化程度，大多数在中学以下，初小以上，一般的缺乏自修能力，或者自修能力较低。但有经验，理解力不低。
    学校的课程分为：国文、算术、社会发展史三门。国文、算术各分高初两级。学生根据自已的程度选择。有国文在高级，算术在初级的，也有算术在高级，国文在初级的，完全按照自己程度而定，以免过高过低，学习不便。每门功课，每周集体上课两次。学生均须遵守学习规则，不能随便旷课，有事不能出席上课的，必须请假。课本通用新华书店出版的中学课本及社会发展简史。教员由机关干部中选聘，每人任一门功课，每周授课二次，按其任课时间多少，给以报酬。学校需用经费，由机关负责解决。
    该校暂定为六个月一期，每期完成一定的课程，如高级算术班自分数学起，在头六个月中把算术全部学完；初级算术班自整数学起，在头六个月学完分数。一期完毕之后，继续二期，以便再加提高，并逐渐增学其他功课。
