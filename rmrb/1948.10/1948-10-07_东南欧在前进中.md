　　Southeastern Europe Marches Forward

　　▲The Polish Council of Ministers decided to abolish the rationing system for bread and flour starting from November 1st. The decision pointed out: This year's bumper harvest, progress in grain purchases, planned use of grain for land tax payments, and the normalization of the grain market all facilitate the unrestricted supply of bread and flour to the people.

　　▲The Presidium of the Hungarian Council of Ministers decided to further reduce the prices of food and industrial products. Grain prices were reduced by 20 to 40 percent, and textiles by 20 to 30 percent. The Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture announced: This year's wheat and rye production reached a total of 21.92 million quintals, an increase of 5.5 million quintals compared to last year. (Each quintal is equal to 100 catties).

　　▲The autumn harvest and grain transportation work in Czechoslovakia is nearing successful completion. As a result of the bumper harvest in Slovakia, farmers have been able to sell surplus agricultural products on the free market at prices higher than rationed grain after completing their grain delivery quotas. The Czech Minister of Agriculture announced: As a result of the implementation of the agricultural plan, the government has provided farmers with 22,000 tractors, 25,000 binding machines, and established 5,000 cooperative machine stations.

　　▲Bulgaria has a bumper harvest this year, and the autumn sowing plan has been almost entirely completed. Bulgaria, which had no tractors in 1939, has now established seventy-one tractor and agricultural machinery stations nationwide, possessing 3,500 tractors and many other agricultural machines. The number of cooperative farms has increased to 714, cultivating 220,000 hectares of land, and the harvest of cooperative farms exceeds that of individual farms by 30 percent.
