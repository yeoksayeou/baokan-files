　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: The youth movement in the Northeast Liberated Areas, along with the development of the revolutionary situation and construction endeavors, is increasingly moving towards unification and centralization. From August 23rd to 30th, the Northeast Liberated Areas Youth Work Conference was held in Harbin, attended by over a hundred cadres from provinces and cities, railway and industrial departments, various organizations, schools, and youth groups. The conference introduced the youth work experiences of Harbin, Qiqihar, Jilin, Andong, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and other provinces and cities, and discussed the most important issues concerning the Youth League in the current Northeast youth movement. A draft of the provisional charter of the Northeast Liberated Areas Mao Zedong Youth League was formulated. The conference decided to establish the Preparatory Committee of the Northeast Liberated Areas Mao Zedong Youth League, electing Jiang Nanxiang, Han Tianshi, and others, thirty-four in total, as executive members of the preparatory committee, and elected Han Tianshi as the director of the preparatory committee and Zhang Ze as the secretary-general, to uniformly lead the Youth League building work in the Northeast. Recently, in order to unify the name and coordinate the steps of the Northeast Liberated Areas Youth League with the Youth Leagues in other liberated areas within the customs, the preparatory committee issued a notice suggesting that the Mao Zedong Youth League be renamed the "New Democratic Youth League." This notice will soon be organized for discussion among the youth league leading organs and league members in various parts of the Northeast, and the official renaming date will be decided after obtaining the consent of the majority of league members.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: The Harbin Youth League, which occupies an important position in the youth movement of the Northeast Liberated Areas, has achieved great success since its establishment on "May Fourth" this year. The League is one of the regional league headquarters in the Northeast Youth League, and has now expanded to include one regional league headquarters, three district youth departments, three branch leagues, and seventy-two branch groups. The number of members has increased from 1,808 to 3,013, distributed in various public and private enterprises, schools, and organizations in Harbin. The vast majority are outstanding and active individuals in their work and studies. The League enjoys high prestige and is supported by the broad masses of young people. The young workers in public and private enterprises in Harbin who are league members now number 744. They generally care about the factories, endure hardships and are hardworking, and can motivate the masses. In the municipal enterprises' production merit campaign, more than a hundred league members have been awarded merits, and many league members have been elected as labor heroes and model workers in the factories. Comrade Fu Gonglin and Teng Wenzhang, league members of a certain factory, scraped the hides on a peeling machine, exceeding the output of three peeling machines. League members of the tram factory helped the busiest machine shop department with wire stripping after work. In various schools, League members have truly become the backbone of the students and a strong assistant to the administration, being the students who make the fastest progress in their studies and are most willing to sacrifice themselves to help their classmates. Among the forty model students with the best grades and character selected from the first and second grades of the Municipal No. 2 Middle School during the summer vacation, thirty-four are League members. During the summer vacation, a construction team of more than three hundred people, with League members as the backbone, participated in the construction of river dams, railways, and other projects, and organized a literary and art troupe and a chorus of more than five hundred people, who were active under the leadership of the municipal league headquarters. League members account for more than 20 percent of primary school teachers, and are the backbone of primary school education. These are all preliminary achievements of the Harbin League building work. The current shortcomings are insufficient education for League members, and League life is either too loose or too rigid, not healthy, rich, lively, and vigorous enough. Some League members also have phenomena of being divorced from the masses due to making League meetings secret, etc.

　　东北毛泽东青年团筹委会成立
    青年运动日趋统一集中
    哈市建国工作成绩优异
    【新华社东北十三日电】东北解放区青年运动，随着革命形势及建设事业的发展，正日益走上统一集中的道路。八月廿三日至三十日东北解放区青年工作会议在哈尔滨举行，到有各省市及铁道、工业部门、各机关、学校、各青年团体干部百余人。会议中介绍了哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、吉林、安东、黑龙江、松江等省市的青年工作经验，并讨论了当前东北青年运动中最重要的有关青年团的许多问题。拟订了东北解放区毛泽东青年团的暂行团章草案。会议决定成立东北解放区毛泽东青年团筹备委员会，选出蒋南翔、韩天石等三十四人为筹委会执委，并推举韩天石为筹委会主任，章泽为秘书长，统一领导东北建团工作。最近，该筹委会为使东北解放区青年团与关内各解放区青年团的名称统一，步调一致，特发出通知，建议将毛泽东青年团更名为“新民主主义青年团”。此项通知即将在东北各地青年团领导机关及团员群众中组织讨论，在取得多数团员同意后，即决定正式更名日期。
    【新华社东北十三日电】在东北解放区青年运动中占着重要地位的哈尔滨市青年团，自今年“五四”成立以来，已获得很大的成绩。该团为东北青年团的区团部之一，现已扩大到包括一个区团部，三个区青年部，三个分团，七十二个支团。团员已由一千八百零八名增至三千零十三名，分布在哈市各公、私营企业、各学校和各机关团体中，绝大多数都是工作学习中的优秀分子，积极分子。团的威信很高，为广大青年群众所拥护。哈市各公、私营企业中的青年工人团员，现达七百四十四名，一般均关心工厂，吃苦耐劳，并能带动群众。在市政企业生产立功运动中，团员立功者超过百人，许多团员在工厂中被选为劳动英雄和模范。某厂团员傅功林、滕文章在一盘剥皮机上刮出超过三盘剥皮机的产量的皮子，电车厂团员下了班帮助工作最忙的机工部剥线环。在各学校中，团员真正成为学生中的骨干与行政的有力助手，是学习上进步最快，最能舍己为人帮助同学的分子。市立二中一、二年级暑期选出的四十名品学最好的模范学生中，有三十四名是团员。暑假期间，以团员为骨干组成了三百余人的建设队，参加修江坝、铁路等工作，并组织了五百余人的文工团和合唱队，在市团部领导下活动。在小学教师中，团员占百分之二十强，为小学教育工作的骨干。这些都是哈市建团工作的初步成绩。现在的缺点是团员教育不够，团的生活或嫌涣散，或嫌呆板，不够健全丰富、生动活泼，有些团员也还有因把团的会议秘密化等等而致脱离群众的现象。
