　　TASS, Paris, September 25th: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 25th. The full text is as follows:

　　At the beginning of each session of the United Nations General Assembly, it has become a well-established tradition to first conduct a general discussion to review the path we have traveled, summarize the results of the past year, and analyze the activities of the United Nations, and, quite naturally, the foreign policies of various countries, especially those that play a significant role in the United Nations. In this session of the General Assembly, we will also do so. We would like to discuss – of course, as briefly as possible – the work of the United Nations since the Second General Assembly in September-November 1947. In the last session of the General Assembly, we pointed out that the main shortcoming of the United Nations' activities was the failure to implement a whole series of very important recommendations of the General Assembly. For example, recommendations on universal disarmament, allowing atomic energy only for peaceful purposes, accelerating the formulation of measures to prohibit atomic weapons, and some other recommendations on important issues, have not been implemented. At the same time, we must also point out a completely abnormal situation, in which some powerful member states of the United Nations are not using their influence to implement the recommendations of the General Assembly and the steps related to these recommendations. On the contrary, they are using their influence to implement measures that are fundamentally contrary to these recommendations, such as in Palestine, Indonesia, racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa, and several other important issues. It goes without saying that this violation of the United Nations Charter, especially through illegal decisions such as the establishment of the Interim Committee (or Ad Hoc Political Committee), the Korean Commission, and the so-called Balkan Committee, has damaged the prestige of the United Nations General Assembly and the entire United Nations.

　　　　Regarding the "Interim Committee"

　　Everyone remembers the circumstances under which the Interim Committee was established last year based on the suggestion of the US delegation. Even then, it was undoubtedly known that the purpose of those who initiated the establishment of this committee was to create a body that would compete with the Security Council, so as to undermine the importance and position of the Security Council, the body that bears the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and security. The problem was obvious at that time. The Interim Committee envisioned by the US delegation was an institution with broader powers than the Security Council. The establishment of the Interim Committee was another step in undermining the United Nations and the entire cause of international cooperation, because the purpose of the US proposal was to transfer the resolution of the most important issues of peace and security to the Interim Committee, thereby obliterating the Security Council, violating the United Nations Charter, and handling these issues not on the basis of the principle of unanimity of the five major powers, but on a different basis. There is no doubt that the adoption of this proposal undermined international cooperation, which is based on mutual understanding, trust, and respect for the interests of all countries, large and small, striving to strengthen world peace and cooperation. However, the Interim Committee did not meet the hopes of its organizers. It is not accidental that the initiators of the establishment of the Interim Committee do not dare to rashly propose the issue of changing the committee from a temporary body to a permanent one.

　　　　Regarding the "Korean Commission"

　　The Korean Commission, established according to the plan of its proponents, was used to cover up foreign interference in the internal affairs of Korea and to facilitate the establishment of a Korean government, composed of people whom the US military authorities had long relied on and planned to rely on in the future, regardless of the interests of the Korean people. We know that the progressive people of South Korea, especially those who are actively engaged in the democratic movement and refuse to yield to acts of suppressing the rights of their people, have suffered and continue to suffer countless facts of tyranny, violence, and even terror. As a result, the US authorities established a puppet government in South Korea through illegal actions and means of dividing Korea, and they insisted that this was the government of the entire Korea. However, such a fabrication cannot deceive anyone. This fabrication becomes particularly prominent when we compare the situation in South Korea with that in North Korea. In North Korea, the broad popular movement for the unification and independence of Korea has promoted the establishment of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, elected by the people of North and South Korea, and the establishment of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. There is no doubt that the future of Korea belongs to the Korean people, who support the unification and independence of their motherland and oppose all attempts to turn Korea into a colony and use it as a bridgehead for aggression.

　　　　Regarding the "Balkan Committee"

　　The efforts of the Balkan Committee, which was illegally established in the last session of the General Assembly, on the one hand to facilitate the suppression of the liberation struggle of the Greek people, and on the other hand to support the false accusations of the Greek royal fascists against their northern neighbors, have also proved to be equally futile. A committee with such a nature has proved to be unable to win prestige for itself or for the entire United Nations. In last year's General Assembly and the First Committee (i.e., the Political and Security Committee), many pieces of evidence were cited to show that the work of this committee was not objective, and there was no basis in the committee's materials for drawing conclusions worthy of attention and trust. This situation has not changed today, and we will inevitably have to address these issues when we discuss the so-called Greek question in the future.

　　　　Economic Issues

　　In the area of economic issues, the United Nations' activities in the past period have focused on issues that, while not entirely meaningless, have no impact on the most vital interests of various countries – especially those that have suffered the most from the ravages of the war caused by the Hitlerite gang. The United Nations Economic and Social Council, the Economic Commission for Europe, and the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East have evaded important tasks and failed to develop programs to help the economic recovery of European countries that have suffered from the war and to help develop the main sectors of their national industries. Although everyone knows that the Marshall Plan puts the United Nations in the dark, the United Nations economic institutions still believe that implementing this plan in every possible way is their most important task. It is no accident that even the UN Secretary-General Lie's report groundlessly states that the Marshall Plan "holds promise for rebuilding economic and political stability in Western Europe." And it is now clearer than it was a year ago that the Marshall Plan has not helped Europe's economic and political stability at all, and it has worsened their economic situation by undermining the economic and political independence of the European countries participating in the plan.

　　　　Major Issues in the Security Council

　　In 1947 and 1948, the Security Council encountered a series of extremely important issues, on the one hand, regarding the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions and recommendations, among which the General Assembly's January 24, 1946 decision on atomic energy and the General Assembly's December 14, 1946 resolution on universal limitation and reduction of armaments should be mentioned first; on the other hand, regarding the acts of certain countries violating the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter and violating the resolutions of the General Assembly during the past period. Although in many cases these violations directly endangered the peace and security of various countries, the majority of countries in the Security Council not only failed to take appropriate steps to eliminate these dangers, but instead supported these violators in a completely opposite attitude.

　　(1) The Indonesian Question

　　The situation of the Indonesian question is like this. At that time, the majority of countries in the Security Council did not take any action to stop the armed aggression launched by the Netherlands against the Indonesian people. The Indonesian issue was decided by the majority of countries in the Security Council to be handed over to the so-called mediation committee composed of representatives from the United States, Belgium, and Australia. The committee stood with the Dutch colonialists and forced the Republic of Indonesia to accept the enslaving Renville Agreement, thus causing Indonesia to lose several rich areas occupied by the Netherlands in 1947. At the same time, the majority of countries in the Security Council rejected the recommendation to cease fire and withdraw the Dutch troops from the land occupied after the war, thus actually encouraging the actions of the aggressors.

　　(2) The Palestine Question

　　The Security Council also failed to fulfill its responsibilities on the Palestine issue. The General Assembly's decision of November 29 last year to establish Arab and Jewish states in Palestine has failed. In fact, the policy pursued by the majority of countries in the Security Council on the Palestine issue was not to try to eliminate the national contradictions in Palestine and establish good-neighborly relations between the Jewish and Arab nations, but to help deepen these contradictions and drive the Arabs and Jews into the path of struggle and armed conflict, which has caused the outbreak of the Palestine war. What contributed to the failure of the General Assembly's decision was not only the direct demands of certain countries to revise the General Assembly's recommendations of November 29, but also the US delegation's proposals to establish a Palestinian trusteeship system or establish a headquarters for mediators. And this headquarters for mediators has not been able to achieve positive results to this day.

　　(3) Atomic Energy Control and Disarmament Issues

　　The Atomic Energy Commission has been working for thirty months, and the Disarmament Commission has been working for almost the same period. Not only have these two commissions failed to accomplish any of the tasks assigned to them by the General Assembly, but in fact, there has been no progress on these issues. A large pile of paper has been used, but things remain the same. The work of the Atomic Energy Commission has proved to be futile because the US government refuses to solve the basic problems, and the direction and nature of all actions related to the abolition of atomic weapons in national defense weapons and ensuring that atomic energy is used only for peaceful purposes must depend on the solution of the basic problems. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union insists on immediately banning atomic weapons and establishing strict and effective international control over compliance with this ban. The prohibition of atomic weapons is necessary because its nature is an aggressive weapon, a weapon used to attack, destroy cities, and massively kill peaceful residents. Only those who intend to maintain this aggressive weapon and harbor plans to attack other countries will oppose the prohibition of atomic weapons. It is these people who place their last hope on the atomic bomb, harboring aggressive plans, fantasizing that they can succeed even in the event that the entire or the vast majority of the people in the attacked country oppose the war and oppose the military aggression planned by the reactionary upper echelons. These people categorically oppose the conclusion of a convention to ban atomic weapons and propose to replace the convention to ban atomic weapons with the establishment of international control of atomic energy. However, it is easy to understand that it is absurd to talk about any atomic energy control unless the use of atomic energy for war purposes is prohibited, because this loses the goal of control. Without prohibiting the production and use of atomic weapons, the proposal to establish an international organization to control the use of atomic energy is meaningless. In this case, even drafting various regulations regarding the various powers, functions, rights, and obligations of the control organization becomes a useless and empty task. Unless atomic weapons are prohibited, all talk about controlling the use of atomic energy is just a means of deceiving countries. Obscuring the people's eyes so they cannot see the smoke screen of the atomic arms race. (Applause)

　　The US government insists on first establishing an international control organization before reaching an understanding on banning atomic weapons. This is putting the cart before the horse. Obviously, the US government has no interest in the progress of the work of the Atomic Energy Commission, which was charged with drafting recommendations to eliminate atomic weapons and all other major weapons that could be used for mass destruction from the weapons of various countries as far back as two and a half years ago. The requirement to first conclude an international control convention and then conclude a convention banning atomic weapons is intended to hinder the conclusion of a convention to ban the use of atomic energy for war purposes. The US representative's attitude on this issue means nothing but to cover up their refusal of any control with verbal control. In addition, serious attention should be paid to the suggestion in the US plan that enterprises that manufacture atomic energy should be owned by international control organizations. In this case, the international organization should become the owner of such enterprises in any country and can implement unlimited and unrestricted interference in the country's economic life based on the decision of the majority. It should be remembered that the US plan not only advocates transferring individual enterprises, but also transferring entire industrial sectors that are in some degree of cooperation with the factories and equipment that manufacture atomic materials to international control organizations. It is not difficult to see what the consequences of adopting the US plan would be. The Soviet Union believes that the international control organization must of course have the right to pass resolutions by a majority vote at a suitable opportunity. However, people cannot agree that this international control organization should actually become an American organization, and that this organization should have the right to interfere in the economic life of various countries, even by the decision of the majority of the control organization. The Soviet Union cannot allow this situation to arise. The Soviet Union knows that this control organization will have a majority that passes one-sided decisions, a majority that the Soviet people cannot expect to have a good attitude towards them. Therefore, the Soviet Union – and possibly not just the Soviet Union – cannot allow the fate of its national economy to be placed in the hands of such an organization. In addition, the US proposals on control do not provide for the possibility of controlling atomic production itself. The second report of the Atomic Energy Commission of the Security Council on September 11, 1947 (which describes the US attitude on this issue) states: effective control to prevent the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes should begin with extremely strict control of the above two basic elements (uranium and thorium). The initial stage of any control system should control the raw materials that constitute the source of these two basic elements. However, it is a waste of effort to find a statement in this report that control of the industry that produces atomic energy will be established at the same time. Therefore, there is no doubt that the United States hopes to use the power of the so-called international organization, in which it can hope to obtain a majority, to interfere in the raw material resources of other countries, but refuses to place its own atomic plants, other enterprises, and raw material resources under international control. This attitude is clearly intended to allow the United States to have unlimited possibilities to manufacture atomic bombs without restriction.

　　The Soviet Union advocates that the properly constituted international control organization should control all processes of manufacturing atomic energy, from the production of raw materials to the finished products. The Soviet Union cannot agree with the position taken by the US government and the British and French governments on this issue, and by some countries that support this position. In this respect, the Soviet Union is not alone. The Manchester Guardian recently published a letter from Lennie, the general secretary of the British Association of Scientists, who correctly raised the following question: "What harm would it do if we agreed to a declaration that atomic energy should not be used for war purposes in any future war? The British Association of Scientists pointed out that there had been similar declarations in the convention prohibiting the use of gas in war. It is therefore strange why the use of atomic energy in war should not be condemned." Lennie's letter also answered this question. It said that since the Soviet Union first proposed the convention, it has become clear in the past two years that the attitude of Western countries on this issue is actually because the US government believes that it needs to maintain the threat of using atomic weapons as a major factor in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. We must remind you again that atomic weapons are offensive weapons, weapons of aggression. All peace-loving countries, millions of people who regard aggressive intentions as enemies, should shout for an immediate ban on the use of atomic bombs that can massively slaughter peaceful residents and destroy peaceful towns. (Loud applause) (⑵⑶)

　　　　Two Kinds of Foreign Policies

　　The emergence of this situation is undoubtedly related to the orientation taken by a powerful member state of the United Nations, such as the United States, towards the entire work of the United Nations. There has been a dramatic change in the foreign policy of the United States in recent years. In the past, the United States, together with the Soviet Union, jointly resisted aggressive forces - fascist Germany and militarist Japan. The United States and the Soviet Union shed blood and sacrificed together on the battlefield against a common enemy and made this struggle win victory and establish peace. The Soviet Union is still continuing its previous policy of fighting against fascism, for democratic principles, for the welfare of democratic countries and the consolidation of economic and political conditions.

　　　　The Soviet Union's Foreign Policy

　　After defeating German fascism and Japanese militarism, the Soviet Union continued its peaceful policy, focusing all its efforts on solving domestic problems, primarily restoring and developing the national economy damaged by the war. The Soviet people are completely devoted to peaceful labor, consolidating and continuing to develop their country's socialist construction, and steadfastly defending world peace and security (loud applause). The Soviet Union's policy is a consistent and thorough policy of expanding and strengthening international cooperation. This is due to the nature of the Soviet state itself, because it is a socialist state of workers and peasants, highly enthusiastic about creating the best conditions suitable for peacefully building a socialist society. The Soviet Union's foreign policy follows the principle of cooperating with all countries willing to cooperate peacefully. It has always opposed all plans and actions aimed at creating disunity among countries, and it has always been a fighter for defending the post-war peaceful democratic principles.

　　　　The United States' Foreign Policy

　　However, the United States' foreign policy is completely different. After the end of World War II, the United States' policy changed its foreign policy. From a policy of fighting against aggressive forces, it turned into a policy of expansion and the implementation of world hegemony plans. The characteristics of the current foreign policy of the United States are: openly supporting the most reactionary fascist-royalist and the most reactionary groups in various countries, constantly giving them financial and weapons assistance, allowing them to suppress the people's democratic liberation movement at home; organizing military alliances or military blocs; establishing new air and naval bases; and expanding and rebuilding old bases built before for war with Germany, Italy, and Japan, in accordance with the needs of the latest military technology; desperately publicizing a new war against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe; frantically engaging in an arms race; and sincerely worshiping the atomic bomb, insisting that it is a saving means to eliminate all dangers and difficulties threatening the capitalist world. This policy incites a war mentality and causes anxiety and shock to the broad masses of people who yearn for peace and quiet construction labor. This policy has nothing in common with a peaceful policy.

　　　　Criticizing the "Five-Power Bloc"

　　It is well known that the US government, together with the governments of Britain and France, has jointly organized a military and political bloc of five countries. The purpose of this bloc is not to prevent German aggression, or to provide mutual assistance against such aggression. It cannot even have this as its purpose, because this bloc is not aimed at the danger of the resurgence of German aggression. On the contrary, it even plans to include Western Germany, which was a pillar of German militarism long ago and was recently a fortress of Hitler's aggression. It is completely clear that organizing such an alliance clearly contradicts the interests of consolidating peace and security among countries. We are familiar with other alliances - alliances concluded among peace-loving European countries to prevent the possibility of new German aggression. The Soviet Union has concluded such treaties with Eastern European countries and with the Netherlands. The twenty-year Anglo-Soviet treaty and the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty are also based on the same fundamental basis. This treaty, and the alliance based on this treaty, which aims to prevent the possibility of new German aggression, is completely in line with the interests of all peace-loving countries. The result cannot be to oppose some peace-loving countries to other countries, or to divide Europe. On the other hand, treaties like the military alliance of Western countries including Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are not only aimed at Germany alone, but may also be used equally against those countries that were their allies in World War II. The entire press of Britain, France, and the United States bluntly said that the military alliance of five Western European countries is aimed at the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. Such a treaty cannot be regarded as defensive. Whoever concludes such a treaty or organizes such an alliance is pursuing a policy that is not at all the same as consolidating peace, and is helping the instigators and organizers of new wars.

　　　　Criticizing War Propaganda

　　The decision passed by the Second United Nations General Assembly last year condemning the propaganda of new wars and requiring the application of news and propaganda tools to help consolidate friendly relations among countries has failed to curb the instigators of new wars. In the past year, they have become more arrogant and more shameless in engaging in their evil deeds, trying to make as many ordinary people as possible fall into the turbid atmosphere of war propaganda, which is also accompanied by the dissemination of slanderous fabrications, concocting the so-called aggressive policies of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, in order to portray the Soviet Union as an undemocratic country and the United States, Britain, and other countries in the Anglo-American bloc as democratic countries.

　　　　Criticizing the Arms Race and War Preparation Plans

　　Along with all this is a frantic arms race, meticulously crafting plans for attacking the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and preparing for other war actions. In view of this, I cannot but remind you that although three years have passed since the end of World War II, the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff, established in 1942 to conduct the war against fascist Germany in the United Nations and to ensure the command of Allied operations, has been in existence to this day and is engaged in secret activities against the interests of peace. Among the American representatives to this staff, we see Admiral Leahy, Admiral Denfield, General Bradley, General Vandenberg; the British representatives are Admiral Henry Moore, General William Morgan, and Air Marshal Middlehurst. In September 1947, under the guidance of the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff, exercises were held in the North Atlantic, with naval fleets from Britain, the United States, and Canada participating. In September 1948, there was the so-called England Defense Exercise, with air forces from Britain and the United States participating. At the same time, steps are being taken to expand and consolidate various bases, mostly air bases, for various future military adventures.

　　The instigators of war against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries freely discuss plans for attacking the Soviet Union from these bases in newspapers, mainly in the newspapers of the aforementioned countries, and talk highly about the strength of American forces, especially the "special attack forces," obviously intending to confuse timid people, and these "special attack forces," as explained by the American magazine Saturday Evening Post on September 11, are bomber squadrons carrying atomic bombs. The influential American magazine "US News & World Report" openly confirmed in an editorial in its April 9 issue that the US Air Force is currently undergoing reorganization to prevent possible wars in Europe. The magazine emphasized that these air combat units based in Britain are being gathered around the Soviet Union by the United States. The magazine reprinted a detailed plan for attacking the Soviet Union, which is being prepared by the US Air Force, mainly with the help of the aforementioned bombers, jet fighters, and aircraft carrying atomic bombs. The magazine published a map indicating the direction of the US Air Force's attack according to the aforementioned plan. One of the notes to this map says: "The United States mainly attacks the Soviet Union from the air. The Mediterranean region, together with Britain and the Middle East, will be of paramount importance. The Arctic region is of lesser significance in this operation. Southern Italy, Sicily, and Turkey will be important bases. Atomic bombs will be used to attack the Soviet Union proper." On May 30, another American magazine, "The New York Times Magazine," published an article expressing regret that the United States actually does not have satisfactory maps of most provinces in Soviet territory. The article said: "This fact may be the biggest disadvantage of our bombing squadrons once they raid the Soviet Union. Accurate maps must be used during bombing." This article shamelessly and openly pointed out one by one the air bases on which it relied to attack Soviet cities, and marked the distances as follows: "The round trip distance from London to Moscow is 3,100 miles, the one-way distance from Tripoli to Rostov is 1,750 miles, the one-way distance from Fairbanks, Alaska to Vladivostok is 3,400 miles, and the distance from the Greenland base to Sverdlovsk is 3,500 miles………." A map published by the American Esso Company in New York also has the same arrogant and shameless nature in terms of inciting war. This map has a challenging and combative appeal, titled: "Map of World War III - Pacific Theater." This map is an example of despicable anti-Soviet and anti-Eastern European new democratic country war propaganda.

　　　　Criticizing the War-Mongering Howls of American and British War Merchants

　　The reactionary forces that have lost confidence in tomorrow are using unlimited defamation of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, using vicious fabrications and distortions of facts, to influence public opinion in the most frantic way, with the aim of deceiving millions of ordinary people and diverting their attention so that they do not pay attention to the real instigators of war. Reactionary groups in the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and other countries have published millions of copies of newspapers, magazines, and books full of bestial hatred for democracy and socialism, openly inciting attacks on peace-loving democratic countries. In this, they are no longer limited to defamation and abuse. At present, this movement is not only carried out by retired politicians and statesmen, senators, and congressmen, but also by people who hold high positions in the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and certain other countries. For example, US Secretary of Defense Forrestal, US Strategic Air Command Commander Kenney, US Secretary of the Army Royal, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee Bridges, British Member of Parliament Brown, Harvey, Moore, Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Wasleigh, Macmillan, and others. Now, these gentlemen no longer come up with those general words and slogans calling for anti-Soviet and anti-new democratic countries. They, especially the representatives of the senior US command mentioned above, move out a set of vivid plans to use the Army Air Corps and atomic bombs to destroy Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, and other cities in the Soviet Union. Therefore, US Secretary of Defense Forrestal was unscrupulous when speaking before the Senate Armed Services Committee. While insisting on expanding the army and adding 3 billion US dollars to meet military needs, he incited anti-Soviet war and urged the formation of a powerful air force that could continuously attack from various outlying bases currently available. Royal, Bridges, Brown, and other adventurers also gave speeches in the same tone. They crudely clamored for attacking the oil fields of Batumi and Baku, attacking the Donets Basin, and industrial areas outside the Ural Mountains.

　　　　American Monopoly Capital Pursues War Profits

　　Representatives of the governments of the United States, Britain, and several other Western European countries have repeatedly stated that their governments do not harbor any aggressive intentions. Contrary to these statements, these countries are engaging in a frantic arms race. In this race, the United States ranks first. It is well known that in 1947, two years after the end of the war, the US Army was three and a half times larger than before the war. The US Air Force was even more expanded, its strength in 1947 being 17 times greater than in 1937. During the same period, the tonnage of the US active navy increased by three and a half times, and the naval personnel even increased by five times. The US budget passed for 1948-49 proves that military spending has increased by almost 4 billion US dollars compared to the previous year. In addition, according to official materials, the military budget intended for re-equipping the US Army, Air Force, and Navy has been planned to increase year by year as follows: 17.5 billion US dollars in 1949-50; 20 billion US dollars in 1950-51; 21.5 billion US dollars in 1951-52; 22.5 billion US dollars in 1952-53. Huge funds continue to be used for military experiments and military research work, for manufacturing various new and improved new weapons, and this manufacturing is pouring profits worth tens of billions of US dollars into the pockets of American monopoly capitalists. The United States is not only focused on preparing for aggressive actions against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, but is also helping several Western European countries make such preparations, equipping their armies with American weapons. All these actions are disguised with the necessity of strengthening defense and preparing to defend the country in the event of foreign aggression. Newspapers have reported that the United States may resume supplying weapons to certain Western European countries under the name of Lend-Lease.

　　This is the current situation in international relations, and the Third United Nations General Assembly is beginning its work in this situation. It is not difficult to expect that, as in the case of the previous General Assembly and the committees of the United Nations, there will be grand and high-sounding speeches on international cooperation, peace and security among countries, human rights, and democracy at this General Assembly. But we know that behind the United Nations, in the various military headquarters and military agencies of the United States and Britain, and in certain countries within the sphere of influence of the United States and Britain, frenzied work that is completely different from the interests of peace or defense of these countries is also being carried out at the same time. People cannot be at ease with this situation. Millions of people who have paid the price of blood for the crimes of the fascist breeders and the organizers of World War II cannot allow a repeat of the war that has brought terrible disasters and suffering to all mankind.

　　　　Three Proposals by the Soviet Government

　　According to the instructions of the Soviet government, the Soviet delegation, for the sake of consolidating the cause of peace and eliminating the threat of new wars incited by expansionists and other reactionaries, specially recommends that the General Assembly pass the following decision: "The General Assembly notes that there has been virtually no achievement in the implementation of the General Assembly's January 24, 1946 decision on atomic energy and the December 14, 1946 decision on universal limitation and reduction of armaments; recognizing that the prohibition of the production and use of atomic energy for war purposes is the primary task; recognizing that universal and large-scale reduction of armaments is in line with the goal of establishing lasting peace and consolidating international security, and is suitable for the interests of the people, reducing the heavy economic burden they shoulder due to excessive and increasing military spending of various countries; considering that major powers - permanent members of the Security Council - maintain huge armies and armaments, and bear the responsibility for maintaining peace and permanent security; in order to consolidate the cause of peace and eliminate the threat of new wars incited by expansionists and other reactionaries; it is specially recommended that the permanent members of the Security Council (the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and China) reduce their existing land, sea, and air forces by one-third within one year as the first step in reducing armaments and troops. The General Assembly recommends that atomic weapons be prohibited because they are weapons used for aggressive purposes rather than defensive purposes. The General Assembly recommends that an international control organization be established within the Security Council to supervise and control the implementation of measures to reduce armaments and troops and prohibit atomic weapons." The Soviet delegation, in accordance with the instructions of the Soviet government, puts forward this proposal and expresses its deep conviction that if the General Assembly can pass the above proposal, it will make a real and significant contribution to the cause of world peace and democracy.

### 维辛斯基在联大的演说

专栏：

　　维辛斯基在联大的演说
    塔斯社巴黎九月二十五日电：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于九月二十五日在联合国大会全体会议上发表演说，全文如下：
    在每一届联合国大会开始时，总是首先作一般的讨论，借以回顾我们所曾走过的道路，总结过去一年的结果，分析联合国的活动，而且十分自然地也分析各国的外交政策，特别是那些在联合国中起重大作用的国家，这已经成为确定的传统了。在本届大会中，我们也要这样做。我们想讨论——当然尽量简要地——自一九四七年九月至十一月的第二届大会以来的联合国的工作。我们在上届大会中曾经指出，联合国活动主要的缺点，在于没有实施大会整个一系列非常重要的建议，例如象普遍裁军、原子能只准用于和平目的、加速制订禁止原子武器的措施，以及一些其他有关重要问题的建议，都不曾实行。同时，我们还必须指出一种完全反常的情形，就是联合国某些有势力的会员国，并不是利用它们的影响来实施大会的建议以及与这些建议有关的步骤，恰恰相反，它们却利用其影响来实施与这些建议基本上相违背的措施，例如在巴勒斯坦、印尼、南非联邦的民族歧视和其他若干重要问题上，就曾有这种情形发生。这种违反联合国宪章，尤其是通过象建立驻会委员会（或称临时委员会）、朝鲜委员会和所谓巴尔干委员会这样的非法决定，它给联合国大会和整个联合国的威信所造成的损害，是用不着特别说明的。
    　　　　关于“驻会委员会”
    大家都记得，驻会委员会去年是在怎样的情形下依照美国代表团的建议而建立起来的。甚至在那时就已毫无疑义的知道了：那些发动设立这个委员会的人、其目的是要设立一个与安理会相竞争的机构，以便破坏安理会这个肩负维持和平与安全主要责任的机构之重要性和地位。问题在那时就已明显，美国代表团所设想的这个驻会委员会，是一个职权比安理会还要广泛的机构。驻会委员会的设立，是破坏联合国和整个国际合作事业的又一步骤，因为美国建议的目的，是要将解决和平与安全这样最重要的问题转交给驻会委员会，从而抹煞安理会，违反联合国宪章，不按照五大国一致的原则而是在另外的基础上处理这些问题。不容怀疑，这个建议的通过，破坏了以相互谅解、信任并尊重一切尽力加强世界和平与合作的大小国家利益为基础的国际合作。然而，驻会委员会并没有符合其组织者的希望。设立驻会委员会的发起人，目前并不敢贸然提出将该委员会从临时机构改为永久机构的问题，这并不是偶然的。
    　　　　关于“朝鲜委员会”
    根据其建议人的计划而成立的朝鲜委员会，是用以掩盖外国干涉朝鲜内政，便利其不顾朝鲜人民的利益，在朝鲜成立由美国军事当局早就依靠他们支持，而且计划在将来也依靠他们支持的人们所组成的朝鲜政府。我们知道，南朝鲜进步人民，首先是那些积极从事民主运动、拒绝向镇压他们人民权利之行为让步的人，曾遭受了而且继续在遭受着专横、狂暴、甚至恐怖的无数事实。这样做的结果，美国当局用不法行动和分裂朝鲜的手段成立了南朝鲜傀儡政府，他们硬说这是全朝鲜的政府。然而这样的伪造是谁也迷惑不了的。当我们把南朝鲜的情形和北朝鲜作一比较时，这种伪造就变得特别显著。在北朝鲜，争取朝鲜统一和独立的广大人民运动，促成了由南北朝鲜人民选出的朝鲜最高人民议会的成立，以及朝鲜人民民主共和国政府的建立。毫无疑问，朝鲜的前途是属于朝鲜人民的，朝鲜人民拥护祖国的统一和独立，反对将朝鲜变为殖民地和利用朝鲜为侵略的桥头阵地的一切企图。
    　　　　关于“巴尔干委员会”
    一方面为了便利镇压希腊人民的解放斗争，另一方面为了支持希腊保皇法西斯对其北境邻国之伪造谴责而于上届大会中非法成立的巴尔干委员会，它的努力也证明了是同样的白费心机。负有这种性质之任务的这样一个委员会，证明了是既不能为其自身也不能为整个联合国赢得名声的。在去年的大会和第一委员会（即政治安全委员会）中，曾举出过许多的证据，说明这个委员会的工作是不客观的，该委员会的材料中，没有任何根据可以得出值得注意与信任的结论。这种情形到今天还没有改变，我们将来在讨论所谓希腊问题时，还不能不论及这些问题。
    　　　　经济问题
    在经济问题方面，联合国过去一段时期的活动，集中在虽然不是毫无意义，但与各个国家——首先是那些受希特勒匪帮战争所造成的艰难困苦最大的国家——的最关紧要的利益毫无影响的问题上。联合国社经理事会、欧洲经济委员会和亚洲远东经济委员会等机构规避了重要的任务，不去制订方案，以帮助遭受战争祸害的欧洲国家的经济复兴，帮助发展它们民族工业的主要部门。尽管谁也知道马歇尔计划把联合国置于不闻不问，但是，联合国的经济机构，仍然认为尽一切可能的办法实施这一计划是它们最重要的任务。事情不是偶然的，连联合国秘书长莱氏的报告，也全无根据地说马歇尔计划“有希望在西欧重建经济与政治的安定”。而现在比一年以前更为清楚的是：马歇尔计划对欧洲的经济与政治安定毫无帮助，而且由于它破坏参加该计划之欧洲国家的经济政治独立，从而使它们的经济情况更为恶化了。
    　　　　安理会上的重大问题
    安理会在一九四七年和一九四八年遇到了一连串极为重要的问题，这些问题，一方面是关于实施联大决议和建议的，其中首先应当举出大会一九四六年一月二十四日的原子能决定，和大会一九四六年十二月十四日的普遍限制与缩减军备的决议；另一方面，是关于过去这一期间，某些国家违犯联合国宪章的原则与条款以及违犯大会决议的行为。虽然在许多情形之下，这些违犯行为直接危及各国的和平与安全，但是，安理会中大多数国家不仅未能采取适当的步骤消除这些危险，反而用完全相反的态度支持这些违犯者。
    （一）印尼问题
    印尼问题的情形就是如此。当时，安理会中多数国家不曾采取任何行动制止荷兰对印尼人民发动的武装侵略。印尼问题被安理会中多数国家决定交给由美国、比利时、澳洲三国代表组成的所谓调处委员会。该委员会与荷兰殖民者站在一起，强迫印尼共和国接受奴役性的伦维尔协定，因而使印尼失去了若干被荷兰在一九四七年占领的富庶地区。同时，安理会中多数国家又否决了停战与荷军撤出开战后所占土地的建议，这样，实际上是鼓励了侵略者的行动。
    （二）巴勒斯坦问题
    安理会在巴勒斯坦问题上，也没有负起它的责任。大会去年十一月二十九日关于建立巴勒斯坦阿拉伯与犹太国家的决定已经失败。事实上，安理会中多数国家在巴勒斯坦问题上所奉行的政策，并不在于设法消弭巴勒斯坦的民族矛盾和建立犹太与阿拉伯民族间的善邻关系，而是在帮助加深这些矛盾并将阿拉伯与犹太人驱入斗争与武装冲突的途径，这已经引起巴勒斯坦战争的爆发。促使大会这一决定失败的，不只是某些国家直截地要求修改十一月二十九日大会的建议，而美国代表团关于建立巴勒斯坦托管制度或建立调停人总部这类建议也是原因之一。而这种调停人总部到今天还没有能够获得积极的结果。
    （三）原子能管制与裁军问题
    原子能委员会已经工作了三十个月，裁军委员会的工作时期也几乎与之相等。这两个委员会不仅没有能够完成大会给予它们的任何一个任务，而且事实上在这些问题上毫无进展。纸张用去了一大堆，但事情还是原样未动。原子能委员会的工作证明了是徒劳的，因为美国政府拒绝解决基本问题，而与废除国防武器中原子武器、保证原子能仅用于和平用途有关的一切行动的方向和性质，都必须依赖基本问题的解决。谁都知道，苏联坚持立刻禁止原子武器并对这禁令的遵行建立严格而有效的国际管制。禁止原子武器之所以必要，是因为它的性质是一种侵略武器，这种武器用作进攻、毁灭城镇和大规模杀害和平居民。只有那些有心保持这种侵略武器，怀抱着进攻其他国家的计划的人，才会反对禁止原子武器。也就是这些人，把最后的一线希望放在原子弹上面，心怀着侵略计划，幻想甚至在侵略国家中的全体人民或绝大多数人民反对战争、反对上层反动集团所策划的军事侵略的情形下，他们也能成功。这些人断然反对订立禁止原子武器的公约，并建议用建立原子能国际管制来代替禁止原子武器的公约。然而，很容易明白，除非禁止使用原子能作战争用途，否则侈谈任何原子能管制都是荒谬的，因为这样就失去了管制的目标。不禁止原子武器的生产和使用，则建立国际机构管制原子能之使用的建议是毫无实际意义的。在这种情形之下，甚至拟订管制机构的各种权限、职能、权利与义务的种种条规，也成为毫无用处和空洞的工作。除非禁止原子武器，否则一切关于管制原子能使用的谈论都只是欺骗各国的手段。遮蔽人民的眼睛不让他们看见原子军备竞赛的烟幕。（鼓掌）
    美国政府坚持首先建立国际管制机构，然后才获致禁止原子武器的谅解，这是把车驾在马的前面。显然，美国政府对原子能委员会工作的进展并无兴趣，该委员会远在两年半以前就负有草拟建议从各国武器中消灭原子武器和一切可用作大规模毁灭的其他主要武器的责任。首先订立国际管制公约，然后再订立禁止原子武器公约的要求，目的是要阻挠订立公约以禁止使用原子能作战争用途。美国代表在这个问题上的态度没有别的意思，只是打算用口头上的管制来掩盖他们拒绝任何的管制而已。此外，应该严重地注意美国计划中的建议，这一建议主张制造原子能的企业，应转为国际管制机构所有，在这种情况下，这一国际机构应成为任何国家这种企业的所有者，并可以基于多数之决定对该国经济生活实行不受限制、不受拘束的干涉。应该记住，美国计划不仅主张将个别企业，而且主张将与制造原子原料的工厂与设备在某种程度上有合作关系的整个工业部门都移交给国际管制机构。不难看到，采纳了美国的计划会产生什么后果。苏联认为，国际管制机构在某一适宜机会当然必须有由多数表决通过决议的权利。但是，人们不能同意这一国际管制机构应实际上成为美国的机构，以及这种机构应有干涉各国经济生活的权利，即令是由管制机构多数的决定。苏联不能允许产生这种情势。苏联知道这一管制机构将有通过偏于一面之决定的多数，将有苏联人民不用指望其有良好态度的多数。因此，苏联——可能不仅仅是苏联——不能允许将其国民经济的命运放在这种机构的手上。此外，美国关于管制的建议没有提供管制原子生产本身的可能性。安理会原子能委员会一九四七年九月十一日的第二次报告（其中叙述美国对这问题的态度）说：对阻止利用原子能作破坏之用的有效管制，应从极严格的管制上述二基本原素（铀与钍）开始，任何管制制度的开始阶段，都应对构成这二种基本原素之来源的原料加以管制。但是，在这一报告中，要找出与此同时建立对生产原子能工业的管制的声明是白费气力的，因此，毫无疑问，美国希望借助于它可望取得多数的所谓国际机构之力，插手于其他国家的原料资源，但拒绝将其自己的原子工厂用其他企业及原料资源置于国际管制之下。这种态度显然旨在使美国能有不受约束地制造原子弹的无限可能性。
    苏联主张：正当组成的国际管制机构，应管制制造原子能的一切过程，即自原料的出产以至制成品。苏联不能同意美国政府和英、法政府对此一问题所采取的立场，及某些支持此一立场的国家，而在这一方面，苏联并不是孤单的。曼彻斯特卫报最近发表了英国科学家协会总书记伦尼斯的信，他正确地提出下列问题：“如果我们同意在任何未来战争中不用原子能作战争用途的宣言，会有什么害处呢？英国科学家协会指出，在禁止战争中使用瓦斯的公约中曾有过类似的宣言。因此，令人奇怪的是，为什么在战争中使用原子能就不能受谴责。”伦尼斯的信件对这一问题也作了答复。它说，自从苏联第一次提出公约的建议以来，在过去两年中已变得很明显，西方国家对这一问题的态度，实际上是因为美国政府认为须要保持使用原子武器的威胁，作为反苏冷战中的主要因素。我们必需再次提醒，原子武器是进攻的武器，是侵略的武器。一切爱好和平的国家，视侵略意图为仇敌的千百万人民大众，应高呼立即禁止使用可以大量屠杀和平居民及摧毁和平城镇的原子弹。（大鼓掌）（⑵⑶）
    　　　　两种外交政策
    这种情势的产生，毫无疑问地是同联合国中如美国这样有势力的会员国所采取的对联合国整个工作的方针有关。美国的外交政策，最近几年来有着激剧的改变。过去，美国同苏联一起共同抵抗过侵略势力——法西斯的德国与军国主义的日本，美国与苏联一起在反抗共同敌人的战场上流血牺牲，并使这一斗争荣获胜利与建立和平。苏联现在仍在继续奉行其以前反对法西斯主义、为民主原则、为民主国家的福利及经济政治条件的巩固而斗争的政策。
    　　　　苏联的外交政策
    在击败德国法西斯主义与日本军国主义之后，苏联继续它的和平政策，集中它的一切努力于解决国内问题，首先是恢复及发展受战争破坏的国民经济。苏联人民完全专心于和平劳动，巩固及继续发展其国家的社会主义建设，不动摇地保卫着世界的和平与安全（大鼓掌）。苏联的政策是始终不渝，贯彻到底的扩大及加强国际合作的政策。这是由于苏维埃国家的性质本身所产生的，因为它是一个工人农民的社会主义国家，高度热心于创造一个适于和平建设社会主义社会的最优良条件。苏联的外交政策是遵循着同一切愿意和平合作的国家合作的方针。它一贯反对一切旨在造成各国不团结的计划与行动，它一向是保卫战后和平民主原则的战士。
    　　　　美国的外交政策
    但是，美国的外交政策则迥然不同。在第二次大战终了之后，美国政策即改变了它的外交政策。从反侵略势力斗争的政策，转变为扩张的及实现世界霸权计划的政策。美国目前外交政策的特点，是公开支持各国最反动的法西斯——保皇党及最反动的集团，经常给他们以金钱及武器的援助，让他们得以镇压国内人民民主解放运动；组织军事同盟或军事集团；建立新的空军、海军基地、以及依照最新式的军事技术需要来扩大及重新建筑前为与德、意、日进行战争而建筑的旧基地；拼命宣传反苏、反东欧新民主主义国家的新战争；疯狂地进行军备竞赛；真心诚意地崇拜原子弹，硬说它是免除威胁资本主义世界的一切危险与困难的挽救手段。这种政策煽动战争心理，引起渴望和平与安静的建设劳动的广大人民的不安与震惊。这种政策同和平政策毫无相同之点。
    　　　　斥“五国集团”
    众所周知，美国政府已与英法等国政府共同组织了五国军事、政治集团，这一集团之目的，不在于防止德国的侵略，或相互援助以反对这种侵略，它之所以甚至不能以此为其目的，是因为这一集团并不是针对德国侵略死灰复燃的危险，反而甚至预定把很久以前就是德国军国主义的支柱、而在不久之前为希特勒侵略之堡垒的西部德国也包罗进去。完全明白，组织这种同盟，显然与巩固各国和平与安全的利益相抵触。我们熟知其他的联盟——爱好和平的欧洲各国间为防止德国新侵略之可能性而缔结的同盟。苏联曾与东欧各国，也与荷兰缔结过这种条约。而为期二十年的英苏条约及法苏互助条约，其根本基础也是相同的。这种条约以及这种条约为基础而旨在防止德国新侵略之可能性的联盟，是完全符合于一切爱好和平国家之利益的，其结果不能是使某些爱好和平的国家与其他国家相对立，或者使欧洲分裂。另一方面，包括英、法、比、荷、卢的西方国家军事同盟之类的条约，并不仅只对付德国一国，而可能同样地用以对付那些在第二次世界大战中曾经是它们盟国的国家。英、法、美三国的全部报纸露骨地说：西欧五国军事同盟旨在对付苏联及新民主主义国家。这种条约绝不能视为防御性的。谁要是缔结这种条约或组织这种同盟，谁就在奉行着一种与巩固和平毫不相同的政策，和帮助着那些新战争的鼓动者与组织者。
    　　　　斥战争宣传
    去年第二届联合国大会所通过的谴责新战争宣传和要求新闻及宣传工具应用以帮助巩固各国友好关系的决定，未能阻遏新战争的鼓动者。过去一年来，他们更加骄横，而且更加无耻地从事于他们的罪恶勾当，力图使尽可能多的老百姓堕入战争宣传的恶浊气氛中，这种宣传还伴之以散布诽谤的捏造，虚构所谓苏联及新民主主义各国的侵略政策，借以把苏联描绘成为不民主的国家，把美国、英国及英美集团的其他国家描述为民主国家。
    　　　　斥军备竞赛与备战计划
    与这一切一并进行的，是疯狂的军备竞赛，是精心制作进攻苏联与新民主国家的计划及从事其他战争行动的准备。有鉴于此，我不能不提醒：虽然第二次世界大战结束已经三年了，但是，为进行联合国反法西斯德国的战争及为保证盟军作战之指挥而于一九四二年设立的英美联合参谋部，仍一直存在到今天，而且在从事反对和平利益的秘密活动。在这一参谋部的美国代表当中，我们看到李海海军上将、邓菲尔德海军上将、布莱得雷将军、范登堡将军；英国代表则为亨利·摩尔海军上将、威廉·摩根将军、及米德鲁斯空军上将。一九四七年九月，在英美联合参谋部的指导下，曾在北大西洋举行演习，参加的有英、美、加三国的海军舰队。一九四八年九月，则有所谓英格兰防御演习，参加的为英、美两国的空军。同时，为了将来的种种军事冒险，正采取步骤以扩大与巩固各个基地，大多数是空军基地。
    反苏与反新民主主义国家战争的鼓动者，在报纸上，主要是在上述诸国的报纸上，自由地讨论从这些基地进攻苏联的计划，高谈美国兵力，特别是“特种攻击部队”的实力，显然打算借此迷惑胆怯的人们，而这种“特种攻击部队”，象九月十一日美国的期刊星期六晚邮报所解释的，即是说载有原子弹的轰炸机队。有影响的美国杂志“美国新闻与世界报导”，在四月九日出版的一期社论中公开证实：美国空军刻正进行改编，以防欧洲万一可能发生的战事。该杂志着重指出：以英国为基地的这些空军战斗部队，正由美国聚集在苏联周围。该杂志转载一个进攻苏联的详密计划，这一计划正由美国空军，主要是在上述轰炸机、喷气式战斗机及携带原子弹的飞机之协助下从事准备中。该杂志刊登一幅地图，指明美国空军按照上述计划出击的方向。这一地图附注之一说：“美国主要是从空中进攻苏联。地中海地区，连同英国及中东，将具有头等的重要性。北极地带在这一作战上的意义较小。意大利南部、西西里岛及土耳其将为重要基地。原子弹将被用来进攻苏联本部。”五月三十日，另一本美国杂志——“纽约时报杂志”，刊登了一篇表示遗憾的文章，因为美国实际上没有苏联领土内大部省份的满意的地图。这篇文章说：“这个事实或许是我国出袭的轰炸队一旦空袭苏联时的最大缺点。轰炸之时，必须使用精确的地图。”这篇文章寡廉鲜耻地公然逐一指明赖以进袭苏联各城市的空军基地，而且标明距离如下：“从伦敦到莫斯科往返距离达三千一百哩，从的黎波里到罗斯多夫单程一千七百五十哩，由阿拉斯加的非尔班克斯到海参崴单程三千四百哩，由格陵兰基地到斯维尔德洛夫斯克三千五百哩………。”纽约的美国埃索公司所出版的一份地图，就其鼓动战争来说，也具有同样狂妄地厚颜无耻的性质。这一地图具有挑战的好斗的号召，图名为：“第三次世界大战图——太平洋战区”。这幅地图就是卑鄙的反苏联、反东欧新民主国家的战争宣传的例证。
    　　　　斥美英战贩的叫嚣
    对明日失掉了信心的反动势力，正利用无限制的对苏联及新民主主义国家的诽谤，利用恶毒的捏造与歪曲事实，以最疯狂的方式影响舆论，其目的在于欺骗千百万老百姓，转移他们的视线，使他们不去注意战争的真正鼓动者。美、英和法、比以及其他国家的反动集团，出版了千百万份充满对民主与社会主义之兽性仇恨的报纸、杂志、书籍，公开鼓动向各国爱好和平的民主国家进攻。在这当中，它们已不再局限于诽谤与谩骂了。目前，这个运动不仅由那些退职政客和政治家、参议员、众议员们客串进行了，而且也由那些在美国、英国、法国及其他某些国家政府中高据要职的人物来进行了。例如：美国国防部长福莱斯特尔、美国战略空军司令肯尼、美国陆军部长罗雅尔、参院拨款委员会主席布里奇，英国下院议员布朗、哈飞、穆尔、空军副总参谋长华斯莱、麦克米伦及其他人等。现在，这些绅士们已不再拿出那些要求反苏与反新民主国家的笼统的言辞与口号了。他们，特别是以上所指出的美国高级统帅部的代表们，搬出一套利用陆军航空队与原子弹以摧毁苏联的莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、哈尔科夫、奥德萨等城市的绘声绘色的计划。因此，美国国防部长福莱斯特尔在参院武装部队委员会上演说时是毫不顾忌的，在坚主扩充陆军及追加三十亿美元以应军事需要时，他鼓动反苏战争，力促组成能够远自目下可利用的各外围基地来不断出袭的强大空军。罗雅尔、布里奇、布朗及其他冒险家，也以同样的论调发表演说，他们粗野地叫嚣着进袭巴统与巴库的油田，进袭顿尼兹盆地及乌拉尔山脉以外的工业地区。
    　　　　美国独占资本追逐战争利润
    美英及其他若干西欧国家政府的代表们曾反复声言说：他们政府并不抱有任何侵略的目的，而与这些声明相反，这些国家，却正在进行疯狂的军备竞赛。在这种竞赛当中，美国位居第一。众所周知，一九四七年，即战争结束后的两年，美国陆军之大为战前的三倍半。美国空军则更为扩张，其一九四七年的实力较之一九三七年增加十七倍。在同一时期，美国现役海军之吨位增加了三倍半，而海军人员则甚至增加了五倍。美国所通过的一九四八——四九年度的预算证明：军费几乎比上年度增加了四十亿美元。此外，据官方材料，拟用于重新装备美国陆、空、海军的军事预算，业已计划逐年增加数目如下：一九四九——五○年度：一百七十五亿美元；一九五○——五一年度：二百亿美元；一九五一——五二年度：二百一十五亿美元；一九五二——五三年度：二百二十五亿美元。巨大的基金继续用之于军事实验与军事研究工作，用于制造种种新的完善的新武器，而这种制造正将以数十亿美元计的利润投入美国独占资本家的腰包中。美国不仅专心致志于准备对苏联及新民主主义国家的侵略行动，而且也在帮助若干西欧国家作这种准备，以美国武器来装备它们的军队。而这一切行动，都用加强防御与准备在外国侵略时捍卫国家之必要来加以掩饰。报章业已登载有美国可能借租借之名而恢复以武器供给某些西欧国家的报导。
    这就是目前国际关系方面的情况，而联合国第三届大会正在这种情况下开始其工作。不难预期：犹如上届联大的情形和联合国各委员会的情形一样，本届大会又将有关于国际合作、各国和平与安全、人权与民主等问题的富丽堂皇的高调演说。但我们知道：在联合国的背后，在美英以及美英势力范围以内之若干国家的各个军事总部与军事机关中，与这些国家的和平或国防利益绝然不同的狂热工作，也同时在进行中。人们不可能自安于这种情势。曾为法西斯的卵翼者及第二次世界大战的组织者之罪行付出了鲜血的千百万老百姓，是不能容许重演曾经带给全人类以可怖灾难与痛苦的战争的。
    　　　　苏联政府三点建议
    根据苏联政府的训令，苏联代表团为巩固和平事业，清除为扩张主义者及其他反动分子所煽动之新战争的威胁起见，特建议大会通过下列决定：“大会注意到关于本大会一九四六年一月廿四日的原子能决定与一九四六年十二月十四日的普遍限制与缩减军备决定的实施，实际毫无成就；认识到禁止供战争用途之原子能的生产与利用为首要的任务；认识到普遍而大量的缩减军备符合于建立持久和平与巩固国际安全的目标，并适合人民的利益，减轻他们由于各国过度且日益增加的军备费用而肩荷的沉重经济负担；考虑到大国——安理会常任理事国——保有巨额的军队和军备，并负有维持和平与永久安全的责任；为了巩固和平事业与消除扩张主义分子及其他反动分子所煽起的新战争威胁；兹特建议安理会常任理事国（美国、英国、苏联、法国和中国）在一年之内将现有陆海空军缩减三分之一，作为缩减军备与军队的第一步。大会建议禁止原子武器，因为这是用作侵略目的而非防御目的的武器。大会建议在安理会中建立国际管制机构，以监督和管制缩减军备和军队与禁止原子武器措施的实行。”苏联代表团遵照苏联政府之训令提出这一建议，并表示深信大会如能通过上述建议，则将对世界和平与民主事业作一真正而重大的贡献。（长时间的鼓掌）（全文完。按：文中小题都是编者所加）（新华社陕北电）
