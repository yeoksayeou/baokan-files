　　Raise Mass Awareness to Promote Central Work
  　Ji Zhong, Taihang, and Ji Luyu Issue Directives on Running Winter Schools
    [Reported by this newspaper] As winter approaches, the Ji Zhong, Taihang, and Ji Luyu regions have successively issued directives on winter schools, calling for immediate preparations to launch winter school campaigns to raise the political awareness of the masses and promote central work, in order to strive for even greater victories in war, production, and education next year. The main points of the Ji Zhong winter school directive are as follows: (1) The general task of this year's winter school is to cooperate with the central work, strengthen political propaganda and education, and raise the awareness of the people. (2) The winter school movement must be a learning movement of the masses themselves. Localities should organize various forms of winter schools according to specific circumstances and the needs of the masses. According to past experience: the most sustainable forms of the winter school movement are, firstly, cultural learning organizations organized by the masses according to their own needs; and secondly, the development of rural arts. Localities should give full play to the role of these two forms as the center of the winter school movement. (3) The leadership must adhere to the principles of mass need and voluntary participation, and should patiently enlighten the masses, strictly prohibiting forced orders and subjective arrangements by the leadership; at the same time, it must prevent laissez-faire. (4) The winter school movement can take various forms, with fixed classes or unfixed gatherings. In towns, it should be done according to the environment. Attention should be paid to cultivating good literacy groups and people's schools to lay the foundation for long-term literacy organizations; cultivating rural arts talents to lay the foundation for rectifying village theater troupes. And pay attention to improving radio stations and blackboards. (5) Plan political propaganda teaching materials. (6) County-level government and civilian organs should hold discussions with the same-level party committees and those experienced in running winter schools to learn from past experience and study methods. Counties and districts should focus on running winter schools in one or several villages to gain experience.
    The Taihang Administrative Office issued a winter school movement directive on the 7th, pointing out that this year, all localities should restore and rectify winter schools and other social education work on the existing basis, so as to more effectively promote the work of ending land reform, rectifying the party, building government, and production and construction in our region this winter. The winter school movement should focus on four major contents: politics (current affairs education, the development of the revolutionary situation, the victory of the People's Liberation Army), production, democracy, and what the Communist Party is. Secondly, appropriate scientific anti-superstition education should be carried out. In addition, according to the different working bases, cultural education can be carried out with emphasis on the needs and voluntariness of the masses to pave the way for the widespread development of education work next year. The general purpose is to clarify the thinking of the masses, raise political awareness and policy thinking, stimulate production enthusiasm, and encourage enthusiasm for supporting the front. In specific implementation, it should be carried out separately according to different regions. In terms of work steps, it is roughly stipulated that school will start on October 20 and end on March 15 next year. The old lunar New Year should be used to rectify and establish rural theater troupes and carry out New Year's entertainment activities to deepen and expand ideological education. Regarding the organization and leadership of the winter school movement, the practice of combining central work in organization should be continued. Cities should study and establish organizations according to urban characteristics, and folk education centers should become the core of activities. Issues that should be paid attention to in the movement are: (1) If volunteer teachers do not have both political and cultural skills, cultural teachers can be set up, and those with culture can be selected to serve as political teachers, who can be elected or concurrently held by cadres. (2) Restore and establish village mass cultural institutions. (3) In the government building movement, cultural and educational work should be carried out for a long time. (4) In the movement, attention should be paid to timely summarizing reports, reporting and exchanging experiences.
    The Ji Luyu Administrative Office clarified that this year's winter school movement should determine the policy according to different regions: in areas where land reform has been completed, it is to combine the end of land reform, party rectification, and government building in rural areas to deepen policy education and democratic ideological education. Secondly, it is production education that combines winter production and prepares for next year's large-scale production. In old and semi-old areas where the masses are well mobilized in villages, young men and women are the main targets, and literacy groups and night schools are established. At the same time, rural theater troupes are rectified and established, and New Year's entertainment activities are carried out to deepen and expand the effect of ideological education. In other different regions, the central work of the locality should be combined to raise the political awareness of the masses. In areas bordering the enemy and new areas, policy propaganda and current affairs education should be strengthened to strengthen confidence in victory and improve the enthusiasm for participating in the war and supporting the front. Regarding the issue of organization and leadership, the education section of each level of government shall uniformly lead the work, and each agency must extract a certain number of personnel to work in the village winter school. It also pointed out that mobilizing the masses to attend school must adhere to the principle of the masses' conscious voluntariness, and promote the spirit of everyone running schools and everyone attending school. The learning time and teaching methods must be suitable for the production conditions and living habits of the masses, and generally, centralized leadership and decentralized learning are appropriate.
