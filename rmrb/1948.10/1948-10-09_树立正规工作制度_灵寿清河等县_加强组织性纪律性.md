[North Yue News] After leading all cadres in the county to study the Four Great Documents and reviewing various phenomena of indiscipline and anarchism, the Lingshou County Party Committee, in order to further improve work efficiency, rectify organs, and strengthen organization and discipline, formulated eight major systems for organ work in September: 1. Meeting System: The County Committee will hold a regular meeting once before the 5th of each month; the County Committee Standing Committee will meet once in the middle of each County Committee meeting; county-level department meetings will be held once a month; district committee and district-level department meetings will be held from the 25th to the end of each month. Regular meetings must be held on time, without unprepared meetings, to ensure that meetings have a beginning and an end, discussing and studying the instructions of higher authorities and work situations, and making work plans for each stage. 2. Reporting System: 1. The County Committee will report to the Prefectural Committee once before the 10th of each month, in addition to reporting at any time. 2. County-level departments shall follow the reporting system stipulated by their respective administrative superiors, and provide a copy to the County Committee each time they report. 3. District committees and district-level departments must adhere to writing letters and reporting once every seven days, and report temporary problems at any time. 4. Reports should be as detailed as possible. Each report should clarify one issue. In addition to reporting at any time, a routine report must be written within two days after each meeting. 3. Leave System: 1. Members of the County Committee ask each other for leave, section chiefs ask the County Magistrate for leave, and other cadres of various departments ask the head of the department for leave. 2. District committee-level cadres ask each other for leave, but must be approved by their direct superiors. Other departments ask the head of the department for leave, but must be approved by the District Committee. 3. Strengthen the idea of serving the people, being selfless and devoted to public service, thinking for the sake of work, advocating taking less leave, not taking leave for minor matters, and not exceeding three days of leave, except in special cases. Establish a leave register for effective registration and report to the County Committee once a month. 4. Lifestyle System: 1. Party life is handled in accordance with the Party Constitution. 2. Daily life and work hours are carried out in accordance with the government's work schedule. 5. Learning System: 1. Cadres staying at home should persist in studying for two hours every morning, and cadres going to the countryside should persist in studying for two hours every day. Collective study is encouraged, and those with low cultural levels should take time to learn culture at any time. 2. Study documents according to the regulations of the County Committee Propaganda Department, and report the learning situation in each stage in a timely manner. 6. Handover System: Departing cadres must clearly explain all public property, documents, finances, and existing problems within three days. Exceptions are made in special cases, but should be reported to the higher authorities. It is necessary to establish a transfer list or oral transfer. One copy of the transfer list is kept by the original organ, and one copy is reported to the directly subordinate superior. 7. Economic System: 1. The number of personnel should not exceed the authorized size, and over-claiming is strictly prohibited. Budgets and final accounts should be prepared and reported on time. 2. When the district convenes village cadres' meetings, it is not allowed to arbitrarily approve village expenses. Those that are necessary must be reported to the county for approval, otherwise the individual is responsible. 3. It is strictly forbidden to arbitrarily mobilize people's power and financial resources. 4. Villages should establish budgets and final accounts for finances. 5. Drug expenses should be used in a unified manner to solve practical problems. Patients should be examined, and expenses should be approved. Individuals are responsible for expenses incurred without approval. Prescription must be returned after claiming drug expenses. District-level drug expenses are managed and used uniformly by the District Committee, and the county manages and uses them uniformly by unit of food. 8. Sick Leave and Recuperation: District-level cadres are discussed by the District Committee and reported to the Organization Department of the County Committee for review and approval, and reported to the government. The county establishes a register for sick leave and recuperation. Those who are truly unable to work due to illness will receive three months of recuperation grain. If there are special cases of long-term incurable patients with family difficulties, they can be admitted to the hospital upon reporting to the county and approval from higher authorities. Those who return home privately will not receive their original supply and will be regarded as unauthorized departure, lack of organization, and lack of discipline. This regulation has now begun to be implemented.

[Jinan Electric] In order to improve work efficiency, correct the chaotic leadership phenomenon of the past, and gradually move leadership towards regularization, the Qinghe County Government held an administrative meeting of key cadres from various sections, offices, and bureaus on September 18. The County Magistrate first made a self-criticism, saying: "In the past, there were no strict regular meetings, reporting systems, and even if meetings were held, they were mostly deployments, without inspection and summary, and no regular reports were made to the Commissioner's Office, which caused a certain degree of chaos in leadership." Then the section chiefs all made self-criticisms. Finally, it was resolved to first establish a regular administrative meeting system. An administrative meeting will be held once a month to report, inspect, and plan work. The time should not exceed two days. It will be held before the 10th of each month. Every two months, each section, office, and bureau must make a work summary and report to the administrative meeting. In case of temporary and urgent issues, a temporary meeting will be convened to discuss and resolve them. In addition, oral or written reports should be established. Each section chief should report orally to the County Magistrate and Secretary-General once every half month. If a section chief goes to work in the district, he should write a letter to report the work situation. Each section should report to the County Magistrate in writing once a month, and the County Magistrate should make a work summary report to the Commissioner's Office every two months. A general cadre meeting will be held every two months to report and summarize work to the cadres, and conduct commendations and criticisms. A criticism meeting will be held once a month, where criticisms can be made about work, leadership style, and individuals and leadership. There should be sufficient preparation before the meeting, the time should be seized, and the content of the meeting should be focused and clear, and no contentless or purposeless meetings should be held. The secretariat must have a written record of the reports, resolutions, and work plans of each meeting for inspection of the implementation. The County Magistrate and Secretary should have a plan to assist and inspect the work of a certain section. When the county government section, office, or bureau convenes a district cadre meeting, it must be approved by the County Magistrate to avoid leadership confusion. When the county government writes a summary report to the Commissioner's Office, it should exchange materials with the County Party Committee Office for research, in order to obtain more enriched and comprehensive content. The county government organizes an office to carry out work under the unified guidance of the County Magistrate.

    【冀南电】清河县政府为提高工作效率，纠正过去领导上的混乱现象，使领导逐渐走向正规，特于九月十八日召开各科、处、局主要干部行政会议。县长首先自我检讨说：“过去没有严格的定期各种会议、汇报制度，即便开会，也多是布置，没有检查和总结，更没有定期向专署汇报工作，因此造成了领导上某种程度的混乱现象。”接着各科长都作了检查。最后决议首先建立定期的行政会议制度。每一月召开一次行政会议，汇报、检查、计划工作。时间不超过两天。每月十号以前召开，每两月各科、处、局要作一次工作总结，向行政会报告。遇有临时紧要问题，临时召集会议，讨论解决。另外建立口头或文字汇报，各科长每半月向县长和秘书长口头汇报一次，如有的科长下区工作，要写信汇报工作情况。各科每月向县长书面报告一次，县长每两月向专署作一次工作总结报告。每两月召开一次全体干部大会，向干部报告总结工作，进行表扬与批评。每月举行一次检讨会，对工作、对领导作风、对个人与领导，都可提出批评意见。会前要有充分准备，时间要抓紧，会议内容要有中心、明确，不开无内容、无目的的会。每次会议的汇报，决议——工作计划，秘书处必须有文字的记录，以便检查执行情形。县长和秘书应有计划的帮助与检查某一科的工作。各科、处、局召集区干开会时，须经县长批准，以免领导混乱。县府向专署写总结报告时，要与县委办公室交换材料，进行研究，以便求得内容更充实，更全面。县府组织一个办公室，在县长统一指导下进行工作。
