Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. TASS reports from a Pyongyang broadcast: Many South Korean parties have issued declarations supporting the entire Korean People's Government headed by Kim Il-sung. The People's Republican Party's statement said: "The establishment of the entire Korean democratic government is a manifestation of the struggle of all the people; in view of the strengthening of our motherland's power, we firmly believe that the People's Democratic Government will eliminate the South Korean puppet government and force the U.S. military to leave South Korea." According to a TASS report from Seoul: Divisions arose in the South Korean puppet National Assembly during debates on the so-called transfer of administrative functions agreement concluded between the U.S. military command and the Syngman Rhee puppet government. A spokesman for the right-wing Korean Independence Party also declared on September 21: "The transfer agreement is an unequal treaty that allows Americans to interfere in internal affairs and is in effect a trusteeship." Puppet Prime Minister Lee Bum Suk and puppet President Syngman Rhee personally came forward one after another, demanding that the puppet National Assembly approve the agreement without discussion or amendment in accordance with U.S. demands. However, many puppet assembly members, fearing popular anger, dared not support Syngman Rhee. Moreover, 28 people openly walked out of the meeting. During the vote, only 78 of the 200 puppet assembly members voted in favor. Afterwards, a representative of the U.S. military command spoke out, expressing dissatisfaction with the puppet assembly members' opposition to the agreement.

    南鲜许多党派发表宣言
  　支持全鲜人民政府
    【新华社陕北四日电】据塔斯社引平壤广播称：南朝鲜的许多党派发表宣言，支持以金日成为首的全朝鲜人民政府。人民共和党的声明称：“全朝鲜民主政府的成立，乃是全体人民奋斗的表现；鉴于我祖国力量的增强，坚信人民民主政府必将去掉南朝鲜的傀儡政府并迫使美军离开南朝鲜。”据塔斯社汉城消息称：南朝鲜伪国会在辩论美军司令部与李承晚傀儡政府缔结的所谓移交行政职务的协定时发生分歧。右翼的朝鲜独立党发言人于九月二十一日也宣称：“移交协定是一个不平等协定，它使美国人能够干涉内政，实际上就是托管。”伪总理李范＠和伪总统李承晚曾先后亲自出马，要求伪国会对该协定不加讨论与修改地遵照美国的要求予以批准。可是，许多伪议员因慑于民众的愤怒而不敢支持李承晚。且有二十八人公开退出会场。表决时，二百名伪议员中，仅七十八人投票赞成。事后美军司令部代表发言，对伪议员反对该协定事表示不满。
