    Bo'ai Malaria Epidemic
    Government Organizing Doctors to Eradicate It
    [Taihang News] Bo'ai, due to its damp terrain, has suffered from malaria epidemics every summer and autumn for several years. Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain has caused malaria to spread to five districts: one, two, five, six, and eight. The number of patients has reached 20,000, which is more severe than in 1946. In the sixth district, the epidemic has affected 21 villages, with 8,279 patients. Among them, six villages are more severely affected, with patients accounting for 56% of the entire village population. In Beimaying, in the first district, over 400 out of more than 600 villagers are ill. The main illnesses are malaria and dysentery, followed by pestilence (patients only experience fever, not chills), but deaths are few. In addition, there is also a case of cholera, although there are few patients, the mortality rate is high; severely affected patients die in the afternoon after contracting the disease in the morning. In order to stop the spread of the epidemic, the democratic government convened a health meeting in early August to study prevention and treatment measures, organized doctors to go to the countryside for rotating treatment, and called on the masses to pay attention to epidemic prevention and hygiene, and to oppose seeking help from gods and Buddhas. At that time, 320,000 yuan was allocated for free treatment. Now, due to the severity of the epidemic, a batch of quinine has been purchased to intensify treatment. It has also been decided to distribute a batch of preferential relief grain and provide free medical treatment to poor military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and the masses. Each team of doctors in the sixth district consists of two or three people, and can treat 100 to 200 people in a village every day. The Special Commissioner's Office has also recently mobilized eight or nine doctors from Qinyang to form a medical team to go to assist in the eradication effort. Currently, the epidemic is declining in some areas, while it is still developing in others.

　　博爱疟疾流行
    政府正组织医生扑灭
    【太行讯】博爱因地势潮湿，数年以来，每逢夏秋即有疟疾流行。今年入暑以来，霪雨连绵，疟疾蔓延至一、二、五、六、八五个区，病者已达两万人，比一九四六年还严重。六区流行者二十一个村，病人八千二百七十九口，其中较重者有六个村，病人占全村人口的百分之五十六。一区北马营，全村六百余口，病了四百余口。主要是疟疾和痢疾两种，其次是瘟症（患者只热不冷），但死亡很少。此外，还有一种虎列拉（霍乱），病人虽少，但死亡率大，重者上午得病下午就死。民主政府为制止疫病蔓延，八月初即召开卫生会议，研究预防与治疗办法，组织医生下乡轮番治疗，并号召群众讲究防疫卫生，反对求神拜佛，当时拨款三十二万元作免费治疗之用。现因疫病严重，又购买了一批奎宁加紧治疗。并决定发一批优抗救济粮，给贫苦的军干烈属和群众免费诊治。六区医生每组二、三人，每天在一个村能治疗一百至二百人，专署亦于最近动员沁阳医生八、九人，组织医疗队，前往援助扑灭。目前病势有的地方已在下降，有的地方还在发展。
