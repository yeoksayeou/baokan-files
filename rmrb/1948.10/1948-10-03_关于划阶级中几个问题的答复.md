The land reform led by the North Yue and Ji Zhong Regional Party Committees has been basically completed, achieving great success. The face of the countryside has been completely renewed. Now, according to the CPC Central Committee's May 25th instructions on land reform and Party consolidation, the entire region's work has entered the villages and is now focused on production. In order to conclude the land reform, they have raised several questions regarding class division and requested a reply from the North China Bureau. The full text of the reply is published as follows:

(1) How to calculate total income? Total income refers to the entire income of farmers, workers, and businesspeople before deducting costs. The total income of farmers who employ laborers does not deduct the wages and food of the laborers. The letter asks whether there is a contradiction between the 1933 document and the draft "Regulations on the Division and Treatment of Various Social Classes in Land Reform" issued by the CPC Central Committee regarding the calculation of total income. Upon checking the 1933 "Decision on Some Issues in the Land Struggle," it states, "The so-called total annual income of the whole family refers to the sum of their own production and the exploitation of others." The so-called exploitation of others here refers to the entire product of the hired laborers. This is consistent with the provision in Section 4 of Chapter 7 of the "Regulations on the Division and Treatment of Various Social Classes in Land Reform" (Draft) issued by the CPC Central Committee: "The so-called total income, for farmers, workers, and businesspeople, refers to the entire income of agriculture, industry, and commerce before deducting costs." The interpretations are completely consistent, and the content referred to is exactly the same, without any contradiction.

(2) How to calculate the amount of exploitation by farmers who employ laborers. In Comrade Ren Bishi's report "Several Issues in Land Reform," 25% is used as the dividing line between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. As for the calculation method of the exploitation amount of farmers who employ laborers, it is to deduct wages and food (other fertilizer and seed consumption are not deducted) from the laborers' production, and see if the surplus exceeds 25% of the employer's total income. If it exceeds, they are rich peasants; if it does not exceed, they are well-to-do middle peasants. This is a generally correct and easily implementable method for calculating the amount of exploitation. For example, if a farmer labors himself and also employs laborers, and his total annual income is 100 shi, and if the laborers' production is 60 shi, and if the laborers' wages and food are 30 shi, then 60 shi minus 30 shi leaves 30 shi, which exceeds 25% of his total income of 100 shi. This farmer should be classified as a rich peasant.

(3) In rural areas, those who mainly rely on operating industry and commerce for their livelihood should be treated as industrialists and merchants. Section 4 of Comrade Ren Bishi's report "Several Issues in Land Reform" should be a principle that must be followed in implementation. The so-called other documents issued by the Central Committee, in addition to Comrade Ren Bishi's report "Several Issues in Land Reform," refer to Chairman Mao's documents published last December, such as "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" and "Chairman Mao's Speech at the Conference of Cadres in Jin Sui."

(4) Regarding the provisions on major labor. According to "How to Analyze Classes" in 1933, those who chop firewood, carry burdens, transport goods, weave textiles, practice medicine, teach, and do other important labor work should be counted as major labor. If one of the above-mentioned types of labor is the main source of livelihood for the entire family, their class component can be considered as laborers. If someone in a landlord or rich peasant family uses one of the above-mentioned types of labor as their main source of livelihood, then that person should be considered as major labor. Their class origin is determined by their family, and their own class component is determined by the method they use to obtain their main source of livelihood. If the person is one of the above-mentioned laborers, but their income is not independent and is used as the common income of the family and is jointly consumed, then the person's component should still be determined by the nature of the main part of the family's common income. In the past, there were many errors in class division regarding the issue of labor and incidental labor. Some were designated as landlords when they had labor but were treated as having only incidental labor, and some were designated as rich peasants when they only had incidental labor but were treated as having labor. This was because there was no clear standard for the demarcation between landlords and rich peasants in the past. However, the above provisions refer to ordinary situations. In special circumstances, there are different treatments. For example, if the amount of land rent and usury exploitation by certain landlords is very large, they should still be designated as landlords even if they participate in major labor. In large families with more than fifteen people, if one-third of the family members with labor power spend one-third of their time each year engaged in major labor, this is also considered as the family having labor. If a farmer who employs laborers also engages in the above-mentioned types of labor, and his exploitation income from laborers exceeds 25% of the total of his agricultural income and income from other various labors (i.e., his total income), then he should be designated as a rich peasant; if it does not exceed, he should be designated as a middle peasant. The family component and personal class component of those who employ laborers for medical practice or teaching are also determined by calculating the amount of exploitation from laborers in the above-mentioned way.

(5) Soldiers are considered major labor. Cooks, feeders, telephone operators, nurses, and buglers should also be considered major labor because they are all soldiers. Cadres who come from soldier backgrounds are considered major labor. Furthermore, cadres who participated in major labor at home before joining the army should be considered major labor, while those who did not participate in major labor at home should not be considered major labor. Intellectuals from exploiting families who are allowed to join the army as soldiers can obtain the component of revolutionary servicemen after one year of service. After obtaining the component of revolutionary servicemen, they are considered major labor.

(6) The debts that landlords and rich peasants lent to farmers before the land reform, whether the loans were in currency or in kind, their principal and interest should be abolished. This is because most of them are feudalistic high-interest loans that hinder the development of production. All non-feudal debts, such as mutual loans between industry and commerce, transaction debts, debts owed by the masses to industrialists and merchants, wage debts, and mutual loans between workers, peasants, and the poor, should not be abolished and should be protected by law. This is because these debts are not within the scope of high-interest loans and are conducive to the development of production. The repayment method should be resolved through negotiation between the creditor and the debtor. As for loans from the People's Bank and cooperatives, etc., if the government has explicitly announced their abolition, then they should still be abolished; if the government has not explicitly announced their abolition, their validity should still be recognized.

　　关于划阶级中几个问题的答复
    北岳冀中两区党委领导的土地改革已基本完成，获得很大成绩，农村面貌已经焕然一新，现在根据中共中央五月二十五日土改与整党的指示，全区工作已进入乡村，正在动生产之手，为了结束土改，他们提出关于划阶级中的几个疑问要求华北局答复，兹将答复全文发表如下：
    （一）怎样计算总收入？总收入是指农工商业者，在扣除成本以前的全部收入。雇用雇工经营的农民的总收入，不扣除雇工的工资粮食。来信问到一九三三年文件与中共中央关于土地改革中各社会阶级的划分及其待遇的规定草案，两者对于计算总收入有矛盾，查一九三三年“关于土地斗争中一些问题的决定”上说，“所谓全家一年总收入，是指自己生产部分与剥削他人部分的合计”。所谓剥削他人部分，在此是指雇工的全部生产物，这与“中共中央关于土地改革中各社会阶级的划分及其待遇的规定”（草案）中第七章第四节规定：“所谓总收入，对于农、工、商业者是指农、工、商业在扣除成本以前的全部收入”；两者解释是完全一致的，所指内容完全相同，并不矛盾。
    （二）怎样计算雇用雇工经营的农民的剥削分量。任弼时同志“土地改革中的几个问题”的报告中，以百分之二十五为富农与富裕中农的分界线，至于对雇用雇工经营的农民之剥削分量计算方法，则是从雇工的生产物中扣除工资和粮食（其他肥料种籽消耗不扣），看其盈余是否超过此雇主的总收入的百分之二十五，如超过则为富农，不超过则为富裕中农，这是大体正确而简便易行的计算剥削分量的方法。比如某农民自己劳动，也雇用雇工劳动，全年总收入是一百石，如果雇工生产物是六十石，又如果雇工的工资伙食是三十石，六十石减三十石，尚余三十石，则超过其总收入一百石的百分之二十五，此农民应为富农。
    （三）在农村中，有以经营工商业为主要生活来源者，即应按工商业者去处理。任弼时同志“土地改革中的几个问题”报告中第四节应为执行中所必须遵照的原则。所谓中央发表的其他文件，除任弼时同志“土地改革中的几个问题”的报告外，是指毛主席去年十二月发表“目前形势与我们的任务”及“毛主席在晋绥干部会议上的讲话”等文件。
    （四）关于主要劳动的规定问题。依一九三三年“怎样分析阶级”中说到，砍柴，挑担，运输，纺织，行医，教书及做其他重要劳动工作者均应算为主要劳动。如以上述各种劳动之一为其全家主要生活来源者，其成份即可认为是劳动者，地主富农家庭中如有人以上述各种劳动之一作为其本人主要生活来源者，则该人应算为主要劳动。其阶级出身则由其家庭决定，其本人阶级成份，则依本人取得主要生活来源的方法决定之。如该人虽是上述劳动者之一，但其收入没有独立性，而将这些收入，作为该家庭共同收入，并进行共同消费者，则该人成份，仍应按其家庭共同收入的主要部分的性质如何来决定。过去划阶级中对于劳动与附带劳动的问题，发生不少错误，或以有劳动当做只有附带劳动，把他订为地主，或以只有附带劳动当做有劳动把他订为富农，都是因为过去对地主与富农分界没有明确标准的缘故。但上面的规定，是指普通情况而言，在特殊情况下，有不同的处置，如某些地主地租债利剥削的数量很大，虽有参加主要劳动，仍应订为地主。又有超过十五口人的大家庭中，全家有劳动力的人员中，有三分之一的人员每年有三分之一的时间，从事主要劳动，亦算这家有劳动，雇用雇工的农民本人，同时又从事上述各项劳动，其对于雇工的剥削收入如超过其农业收入与兼营其他各种劳动收入的总和（即其总收入）百分之二十五以上者，则订为富农，不超过者应订为中农，因行医、教书而家庭雇用雇工劳动，其对于雇工的剥削分量亦依上述方法计算来决定其家庭成份与本人阶级成份。
    （五）战士算主要劳动，炊事员、饲养员、电话员、看护员、司号员亦应算主要劳动。因同是战士。由战士出身的干部，算主要劳动；又部队干部原在家即参加主要劳动者，应算主要劳动，原在家不参加主要劳动者，则不算主要劳动。剥削者家庭出身的知识分子被允许参加军队当战士，入伍满一年即可取得革命军人成份，在已取得革命军人成份后，即算为主要劳动。
    （六）土改前地主富农贷给农民之债务，不论所贷是货币或是实物，其本利应一律废除。因多系封建性高利贷，妨碍生产发展。一切非封建性之债物，如工商业间的相互借贷，交易货帐，群众对工商业者之赊欠帐、工资帐、与工农贫民之间的相互借贷，概不废除，并受法律保护。因这些债务，不在高利贷范围之内，且有利于生产之发展，偿还办法，由债主债户双方协商解决。至人民银行合作社之贷款等，如已由政府明文宣布废除者，则仍废除，如未经政府明文宣布废除者，仍应承认其有效。
