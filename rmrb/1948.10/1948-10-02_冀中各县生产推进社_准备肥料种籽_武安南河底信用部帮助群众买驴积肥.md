Helping the Masses Solve Difficulties in Wheat Planting

　　Production Promotion Cooperatives in Various Counties of Central Hebei
    Prepare Fertilizers and Seeds
    Nanhedi Credit Cooperative in Wu'an Helps the Masses Buy Donkeys to Accumulate Fertilizer
    [Central Hebei Electric] Production promotion cooperatives in many counties of central Hebei are actively preparing fertilizers, arsenic sulfide (insecticide), wheat seeds, and agricultural tools to solve the difficulties of farmers in autumn plowing and wheat planting. The Ding County Promotion Cooperative has prepared 20,000 jin of "72" wheat seeds, 30,000 to 50,000 jin of fertilizer (black beans), and 1,000 iron shovels to promote "72" wheat. The Lixian Promotion Cooperative transferred 9,000 jin of wheat seeds from Ding County and prepared 900 jin of arsenic sulfide. The Anguo Promotion Cooperative prepared 100 shi of wheat seeds, 30,000 jin of bean cakes, and 1,000 jin of arsenic sulfide. The Gaocheng Promotion Cooperative focuses on preparing fertilizers, having purchased 20,000 jin of night soil and 20,000 jin of black beans from Shijiazhuang, and the bone meal factory is rushing to produce bone meal. Raoyang, Wuji, Anping, Shenxian, Jianguo, Renqiu and other places have also prepared wheat seeds, arsenic sulfide, and fertilizers.
    [Taihang News] The Nanhedi Cooperative Credit Department in Wu'an, in order to solve the difficulties of the masses in autumn harvesting and wheat planting, mobilized the masses to deposit wheat in the credit department after the wheat harvest, and also borrowed some cotton seeds from the bank, lending them to the masses to help them purchase livestock for transportation, laying the foundation for autumn harvesting and wheat planting. In July and August, eleven households borrowed cotton seeds to buy livestock, borrowing a total of 2,785 jin and buying four donkeys. There is also one household that has not bought yet and is currently buying. It also lent 700 jin of cotton seeds to the Zhang Yin and Liu Erhai mutual aid team to organize a cotton shed. It also helped the mutual aid team mobilize cotton shares for production, which has now begun operation, with each of the five shareholders contributing 150 jin of cotton seeds. In addition, it lent 1,820 jin of wheat to other villages and this village to help the masses without capital for transportation. The masses felt that fertilizer was lacking for planting wheat, so the cooperative's oil mill prepared 5,600 jin of sesame cakes, preparing to lend them to the masses for planting wheat, and they would return cotton seeds after the autumn harvest. Eighty jin per mu can solve the fertilizer problem for 70 mu of land. The cooperative also called on the masses to collect Ailanthus altissima seeds. At first, the masses did not collect them, not knowing whether they could be used in the field, fearing that they would be useless and waste effort, and they could not collect much each day. The cooperative mobilized the masses, saying that they guaranteed that they could be used in the field and could also kill insects. If they were afraid, the cooperative would buy them at 200 yuan per jin. Seeing that it would work, the masses began to take action. It is estimated that the whole village can collect more than 1,000 jin of Ailanthus altissima seeds, which can solve the fertilizer problem for more than 100 mu of land.
    The credit department of this village lends physical objects to help the masses solve capital difficulties in production, which is not only supported and praised by the masses in this village, but also praised by the masses in other villages, because it lends grain to other villages to help many people. The masses in other villages said that the cooperative in Nanhedi is really good. "If our village had such a cooperative, it would be so convenient for the masses! If you want to engage in production and have no capital, you don't have to worry."

　　冀中各县生产推进社
    准备肥料种籽
    武安南河底信用部帮助群众买驴积肥
    【冀中电】冀中不少县的生产推进社正积极准备肥料、信石（杀虫药）、麦种、农具等物，解决农民秋耕种麦的困难。定县推进社，为推广七二小麦，已准备七二麦种二万斤，肥料（黑豆）三万至五万斤，铁锨一千张。蠡县推进社由定县调运麦种九千斤，准备信石九百斤。安国推进社准备麦种一百石，豆饼三万斤，信石一千斤。藁城推进社着重准备肥料，已由石门买到大粪二万斤，黑豆二万斤，骨粉厂正在赶造骨粉。饶阳、无极、安平、深县、建国、任邱等地也都准备了麦种、信石、肥料等。
    【太行讯】武安南河底合作社信用部，为了解决群众秋收种麦中的困难，麦收后即动员群众往信用部存麦子，又从银行贷到一部籽棉，贷给群众，帮助群众购买牲口进行运输，打下秋收种麦的基础。七八月间，贷籽棉买牲口的有十一户，共贷二千七百八十五斤，买到驴四头。还有一户未买，现正在买。又贷给张银、刘二海互助组籽棉七百斤，组织了一个花房。并帮助该互助组动员以棉花入股，进行生产，现已开始经营，五股每人入籽花一百五十斤。另外往别村和本村贷麦子一千八百二十斤，帮助没资本的群众进行运输。群众种麦子都感到肥料缺乏，合作社油房即弄了麻饼五千六百斤，准备贷给群众种麦，到秋后还棉花籽。每亩地上八十斤，能解决七十亩地肥料。合作社又号召群众弄椿籽，开始群众都不弄，不知道能否上地，怕不顶事，白费工，每天又弄不到多少，合作社就动员群众说保证能上地，还能除虫。如要害怕，合作社收买，每斤按二百元。群众看的能行，就都动起手来。估计全村能弄椿籽一千多斤，又能解决一百多亩地的肥料问题。
    该村信用部往外贷实物，帮助群众解决生产中的资金困难，不仅得到本村群众的拥护和赞扬，同时也得到外村群众的好评，因他往外村贷粮，帮助群众也很多。外村群众都说南河底的合作社真好。“咱村要有这样一个合作社，群众该多方便！搞点生产，没资本也不发愁了。”
