[Ji'nan News] Ji'nan Third District Committee Office reports: In order to implement the spirit of party rectification, before the Jinnan Third District Committee held a centralized meeting of the land reform work teams in each county to summarize their work, it arranged for the appraisal and selection of model workers. The criteria for models were: (1) Work is active and responsible, and emotions are consistent. (2) The position is clear, the style is upright, cadres are united, and the masses are contacted. (3) Abide by various systems. (4) Study is relatively good. In the beginning, everyone did not take this very seriously, thinking that it did not matter whether they were a model or not. Later, after repeated mobilization, it was explained that the work had come to an end, and personal thoughts and all aspects should be summarized. Rewards and punishments should be clear, which is necessary. It also called on everyone to carry out this work in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. After this, each team carried out the selection seriously and earnestly, not obliterating any advantages, but not easily letting go of a single shortcoming. Many vivid model deeds of comrades were discovered in the selection. For example, Comrade Guo Zhenwen, the leader of the Dongzhangbao group of the Qizhi team, was like a "magnet" in contacting the masses. As long as he stood in the village, men, women, old and young would surround him because he worked deeply, was familiar with the masses, and could mingle with them. In the group, he was very concerned about the cadres. In the hot summer, when others were asleep, he would go to cover them with quilts. When they were sick, he took extra care of them. Therefore, he was supported by all the comrades in the group, united all the comrades in the group, and everyone was in high spirits at work, often maintaining a full staff. He was originally illiterate in study. As a result of his efforts in the past six months, he is now able to write simple letters. This time, he was selected as a first-class model. Comrade Fan Shaoshun of the Daming team joined the work team after party rectification. He was very active in his work, not sleeping for several nights when he was busy. When others complained and said backward things, he was able to adhere to principles and carry out struggle. Although he was once isolated, he did not lose heart and was able to patiently persuade comrades to abide by various systems, which was unanimously supported by the entire group. Comrade He Jinxi, of the Handan team, is an old comrade in his fifties. He is active in his work, adheres to the system, and does not go home. Comrade Shao Huaitang of the Qizhi team stayed on the job even when he was sick for more than 20 days. Comrade Li Zhishan, a young comrade of the Guangping team, went deep into the masses very well. Several poor peasant backbones he cultivated were elected as committee members, and their studies also progressed rapidly. He was originally only roughly literate, but now he can write simple summaries. Comrade Meng Xike of the Linzhang team used to be fond of beating and scolding people before party rectification, and his style was not good. In the past six months, he has not only not relapsed, but also been able to patiently persuade others when he sees them beating and scolding people. He is particularly active in his work. He ran to several villages a day to fight the dyke and block the water, working very hard. Comrade Bai Xinjia of the Women's School was active in her work and studied well, and was also selected as a model this time. A total of 21 first-class models and 53 second-class models were selected from each team. Some of these model comrades had been punished in the party rectification, and all those who had been given warnings in person were revoked. Some probationary party members were transferred to full party membership. In the appraisal, those who made mistakes were criticized and educated for minor offenses, and disciplinary sanctions were imposed for serious offenses. One comrade borrowed 100,000 yuan from a well-to-do middle peasant in the village, which was purely extortion. After it was discovered, he returned it, and he indulged a mass in smuggling, carrying cigarettes and superstitious items from Linzhang to Weixian to sell, and he used 60,000 yuan of other people's money. Another comrade stirred up disunity in the group, wrote letters to others scolding the group leader, did not work properly, and affected the work of others. The above two comrades were given certain disciplinary punishments.

Editor's note: The Ji'nan Third District Committee's appraisal and selection of model cadres, criticism and punishment of cadres who make mistakes, and strict enforcement of rewards and punishments are good. However, the extremely important condition of mastering the party's policies and lines has not been clearly put forward, which is a major shortcoming. Although "clear position" was mentioned in the second item of the model conditions, judging from the comrades who were rewarded, most of them worked hard and studied hard, and their style was better, but there was no mention of how they mastered the policies in their work. This is good for promoting everyone's enthusiasm, but it has a smaller effect on improving cadres' policy and ideological level. According to another report, some work teams of the Third District Committee have made some "left" and "right" leaning errors in their work. Special attention should be paid to this aspect, praising those correct practices and opinions, criticizing those incorrect practices and opinions, and summarizing and improving them. The meaning will be even greater, and the selection of models should gradually move in this direction.

### 冀南三地委严明奖惩制度　鉴定干部评选模范

　　冀南三地委严明奖惩制度
  　鉴定干部评选模范
    【冀南讯】冀南三地委办公室报导：三地委为贯彻整党精神，在各县土改工作队集中开会总结工作之前，曾布置鉴定及评选模范工作者。模范条件为：（一）工作积极负责，情绪经常。（二）立场明确作风正派，团结干部联系群众。（三）遵守各种制度。（四）学习较好。开始时，大家对此不很认真，认为当不当模范没关系，后经反复动员，说明工作告一段落，个人思想各方面也应作一总结，好的奖励，不好的批评。赏罚严明，这是应该的。并号召大家以批评与自我批评精神进行这一工作。此后各队即严肃认真的进行评选，有一点优点不予抹煞，但对一个缺点也不轻易放过。评选中发现许多同志生动的模范事迹，如企之队东漳堡组组长郭振文同志，在联系群众上好似一块“吸铁石”，只要他一站在村中，男女老少就围一圈，原因是他工作深入，熟悉群众，能与群众打成一片。在组里对干部非常关心，夏天炎热，别人睡了，他去给盖被子，有了疾病，他更照顾得周到。因此得到全组同志拥护，团结了全组同志，大家工作情绪很高，经常保持了满员。学习上原来不识字，这半年努力的结果，现已能写简单信，这次被选为甲等模范。大名队范绍顺同志，整党后参加工作队，工作很积极，忙时几夜不睡，别人发牢骚说落后话，他能坚持原则，进行斗争。虽曾一度遭受孤立，但不泄气，并能耐心说服同志遵守各种制度，得到全组一致拥护。邯郸队贺金锡是个五十多岁的老同志，工作积极，坚持制度，不回家。企之队邵淮堂同志，病了二十多天都始终不脱离工作。广平队青年同志李治山，深入群众很好，他培养的几个贫农骨干都当选了委员，学习进步也很快。原来只粗识文字，现能写简单总结。临漳队的孟喜科同志，整党前好打骂人，作风不好，半年来不仅未重犯，且见到旁人打骂人，还能耐心说服。工作特别积极。打堤堵水中，一天跑几个村，很卖力气。妇校的白心恝同志，工作积极、学习好，这次都被选为模范。各队共选出甲等模范二十一名，乙等模范五十三名。这些模范同志，有的曾在整党中受过处分，凡当面警告以下的，都予以撤销。有的候补党员，予以转党。鉴定中，对于犯错误的，轻的进行了批评教育，重的则执行纪律制裁。有一同志在村里借一家中农的钱十万元，纯系敲诈性质，经发觉后始退回，并放纵一群众走私，从临漳携纸烟及迷信品到魏县卖，他使了人家六万元。另一同志，挑拨组里不团结，给别人写信骂组长，不好好工作，且影响别人工作。以上两同志均受到了一定纪律处分。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　
    编者按：冀南三地委评选模范干部，批评与处分犯错误干部，赏罚严明，这是好的。但对掌握党的政策路线这个极端重要的条件没有明确提出，是一个大的缺点。模范条件第二条中虽曾提出“立场明确”，但从被奖的同志看，多是工作学习努力，作风较好，并未提到工作中掌握政策如何。这在发扬大家积极性上有好处，但在提高干部政策与思想水平上则作用较小。据另一报导，三地委有些工作队在工作中曾犯了一些左右倾错误，这方面应特别注意，表扬那些正确的做法与意见，批判那些不正确的做法与意见，并加以总结提高，意义一定更大些，评选模范，应逐渐向这个方向推进。
