　　How Does a Rich Peasant Change Their Class Status?
    Question: "A landlord who labors for five years, or a rich peasant who does not exploit for three years, can have their class status changed." Does "a rich peasant who does not exploit" mean completely no exploitation, or does it mean that exploitation not exceeding 25% for three years is sufficient to change their class status? This question is unclear, and many comrades are arguing about it. Please answer.
    Furthermore, if a household employs one long-term worker and has one main laborer, and according to general calculations, the exploitation can account for 25% of the total income, should this be considered a prosperous middle peasant? (This refers to a situation where this family has no other exploitation or income.) However, in many villages in Pingshan, the blackboard newspapers, under the heading of revising class status, state: "A household with one main laborer and one long-term worker employed for three years is a rich peasant." Is this correct? Please answer this as well.

    Answer: To change the class status of a rich peasant, it is not necessary to have absolutely no exploitation. If the income from exploitation does not exceed 25% of the total income for three years, they can be treated as a prosperous middle peasant. If there is no exploitation at all for three years, they should be considered a middle peasant or other.
    In general, if a household employs one long-term worker and has one main laborer, and if the labor of the hired worker and the employer are equal, and the wages and food paid to the hired worker are sufficient to maintain their life, and the family has no other income or other exploitation, then the income from exploitation is exactly one-quarter (i.e., 25%) of their total income. Therefore, this household is a prosperous middle peasant and should not be considered a rich peasant. This is for ease of calculation and is not entirely accurate. It would be better to calculate it specifically if possible, but to say generally that a household with one main laborer and one long-term worker employed for three years is a rich peasant is incorrect. The Pingshan County Committee should check and correct this. 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor

### 富农怎样才算变成份？

　　富农怎样才算变成份？
    问：“地主劳动五年，富农不剥削三年，便可以改变其成份”，所谓富农不剥削是指完全没有剥削或是剥削不超过百分之二十五满三年即可改变其成份，这问题搞不清，许多同志都在争论，请答复。
    再，家中雇用一个长工，另有一个主要劳动力，按一般算法其剥削可占总收入的百分之二十五，应为富裕中农（这是指这一家没有别的剥削也没有别的收入说的），但平山好些村子的黑板报上在改订成份的标题下写着“家中有一主要劳动力，又雇一长工，已满三年便是富农”，这到底对不对，请一并作复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（王振国）
    答：富农改变成份，不一定要完全没有剥削，其剥削收入不超过总收入百分之二十五满三年，即可按富裕中农待遇。若毫无剥削满三年则应为中农或其他。
    在一般情况下，家中雇用一个长工，家中有一个主要劳动力，假如雇工与雇主劳动力相等，雇主付给雇工的工资吃粮足以维持其生活，而其家庭又无其他收入与其他剥削的话，则其剥削收入恰为其总收入的四分之一（即百分之二十五）。所以这一户即为富裕中农而不应为富农。这样是为计算便利，并不十分精确，如能具体计算更好，但笼统地说家中有一个主要劳动力，又雇一长工，已满三年便是富农是不对的，应请平山县委检查改正。　　　　　　　　——编者
