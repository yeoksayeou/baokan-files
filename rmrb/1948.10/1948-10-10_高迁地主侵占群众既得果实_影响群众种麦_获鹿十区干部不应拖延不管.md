Landlords in Gaoqian Usurp Fruits Already Gained by the Masses, Affecting Wheat Planting; Cadres in the Tenth District of Huolu Should Not Delay and Ignore

　　Gaoqian Village in the Tenth District of Huolu is a village in a newly liberated area. Recently, there has been a phenomenon of landlords "returning home in a big way," driving many people out of the houses they had newly obtained. The masses are discussing this, but the district and village cadres are not resolving the issue, causing suspicion among the masses.

　　Since the heavy rain on August 10th, the district cadres, in order to properly accommodate the old landlords and rich peasants, said at a meeting: "Now it is raining, and the landlords' houses are leaking and uninhabitable. At the same time, it is harvest time. If the landlords' original houses are unoccupied, they can temporarily move back in, but it will not be considered theirs." After this was said, some bad element landlords and old rich peasants distorted the meaning and took the opportunity to become active, threatening the masses: "Good! Today you give us the houses, tomorrow you will give us the land. Not a single grain, piece of clothing, or item of furniture from my house can be missing. If anything is missing, it won't do!" Such threats from landlords and rich peasants frightened many poor peasants. They reflected: "You say we are being emancipated, but you are giving the landlords' houses back to them. In the future, we will have to return the grain, land, and clothing to them. Poor peasants still won't be able to live. We better not plant wheat in the fields of those landlords and rich peasants after this autumn, it won't stay with us." Liang Lianshan, the mother of the district cadre, also said to the chairman of the farmers' association: "We should not haul manure to the fields of those landlords and rich peasants, nor should we plant wheat in their fields. It won't stay with us anyway, we might as well give the land back to them earlier!"

　　Taking advantage of this opportunity, the landlords' counter-offensive became even stronger. On August 24th and 25th, they began to drive out the poor peasants, not allowing them to live in the original landlord houses, and said some threatening words. Landlord Du Jixiang drove out the poor peasant Chen Erbai, saying: "Chen Erbai, if you resist my four brothers, you won't get to move out of the house. If you can't resist, then move out quickly." Chen Erbai was so scared that he said: "I'll move, I'll move!" Rich peasant Du Jixing drove out the family member of a soldier, Wang Fanwu, saying: "Everyone else has moved, what are you waiting for? Move out quickly, I still have to get through the autumn harvest!" Landlord Du Fengqiu drove out the poor peasant Du Baiyin, telling Baiyin's wife: "You are occupying my house, you must move out by this morning. If you can't move out in the morning, you will have to pay for the house in the afternoon!" According to incomplete statistics from the 6th, there were more than 40 landlord households and more than 30 rich peasant households in the village. (How many households are there in total in Gaoqian Village? Are there any incorrectly classified individuals among these landlords and old rich peasants? The leadership should check this according to the central government's class demarcation documents. - Editor) Now there are already more than ten landlord households and five rich peasant households that have moved back to their old homes. From the whole village's perspective, three-quarters of the landlords have moved back to their old homes, and most of the poor peasants have been driven out.

　　After this happened, the district and village cadres of the village knew about it, but they have been delaying and not resolving it, causing ideological doubts among the masses. Now the poor and hired peasants are reflecting that no one dares to plant wheat in the newly distributed land. They hope the leadership will resolve this quickly to avoid hindering wheat planting.

　　After the feudal exploitation of landlords and rich peasants has been thoroughly liquidated, it is right to provide appropriate resettlement for those who cannot maintain their lives through production. If they have not yet been resettled, they should be resettled quickly, but specific situations must be distinguished. The farmers themselves should carry out the resettlement; the leadership should not take over everything, and should not make general appeals at village meetings. The occurrence of the Gaoqian issue should be deeply examined from the leadership of the district cadres. At the same time, in resettling landlords and rich peasants, they must not be allowed to take the opportunity to encroach on the fruits already gained by the poor and hired peasants. The landlords and rich peasants of Gaoqian Village (even if some of them have been wrongly classified and suffered losses, they should not directly grab fruits from the emancipated peasants) dare to arbitrarily threaten the masses and drive the poor and hired peasants out of the houses they have been allocated. This is a reactionary behavior, and the leadership should mobilize the masses to stop it. At the same time, the main culprits should be punished by the government according to law. Tell the masses: the government resolutely protects the masses' vested interests in the land reform, stabilizes the masses' emotions, allows them to transport manure with peace of mind, and plant wheat in a timely manner. If one turns a blind eye, or delays and ignores it under the pretext of uniting all strata for production, it will cause serious errors.

　　高迁地主侵占群众既得果实
    影响群众种麦
    获鹿十区干部不应拖延不管
    获鹿十区高迁村是个新区村庄，近来发现地主“大还家”，把好多群众从新分得的房宅里给赶出来，群众纷纷议论，区村干部也不给解决，引起群众怀疑。
    自从八月十号下了大雨后，为了适当安置地主旧富农，区干部曾在大会上说：“现在下雨，地主的房子都漏的不能住，同时又到秋收时候，如果地主原来房子没人住，可让地主暂时搬回去住，但不算是他的。”这样一说，有些坏分子地主旧富农把这句话加以歪曲，趁机活动起来，威胁群众说：“好！今天给房子，明天给地，我家的粮食、衣服、家具一点都不能短了，短了一点也不行！”地富坏分子这样一威胁，有好多贫农都怕了。反映说：“叫咱翻身哩，把地主的房子又给了人家，将来把粮食、土地、衣裳也得还了人家，贫农还是不能过。趁早今年秋后可别往人家（地富）地里种麦子了，看落不住。”区干部梁连山的母亲也给农会主席说：“咱可别往人家（地富）地里拉粪了，也别往人家（地富）地里种麦子了，种上也落不住，还不如早些把地给人家（富地）哩！”
    地主趁此机会，反攻劲头更大了，在八月二十四、五号，即开始赶贫农，不让贫农在原来地主房内住，并说出一些威胁的话来。地主杜吉祥，把贫农陈二白赶出门来说：“陈二白，你如果顶住我弟兄四个，你就不给誊房子，你如果顶不住，就快给誊。”吓的陈二白说：“誊就誊吧！”富农杜吉星把军属王范五给赶出来说：“别人都搬了，你还等什么，赶快往出搬，我还要过秋哩！”地主杜凤秋把贫农杜白银给赶出来，并给白银妻说：“你占我的房子，在今天上午一定要给我搬出去，上午誊不了，下午就得给房价！”据六号不完全统计，该村共有四十多户地主、三十多户富农。（高迁村总共有多少户？这些地主旧富农中是否有成份订错者？领导上应根据中央划阶级文件检查一下。——编者）现在就有十几户地主、五户富农已经搬回老家去。从全村说来，有四分之三的地主已经搬回老家，并把大部贫农都给赶出来。
    这个事情发生后，该村区村干部就知道了，一直拖延不加解决，引起了群众的思想怀疑，现在贫雇农民反映，谁也不敢往新分的地里种麦子了，希望领导上赶快解决，以免妨碍种麦。　　　　冯新正
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    在地富的封建剥削已经彻底清算之后，如有不能维持生活进行生产者，对他们进行适当的安置是对的，如尚未安置，应迅速给以安置，但须分别具体情况。由农民自己进行安置，领导上不得包办，更不应在村民大会上进行普遍号召。高迁问题的发生，应从区干部的领导上进行深切的检查。同时，在安置地富中，绝不能允许其趁机侵夺贫雇既得果实。高迁村地富（即使其中有些错订成份而受损失，也不应直接从翻身农民手中乱抢果实）竟敢任意威胁群众，并把贫雇农从分得的果实房宅中赶走，这是一种反动行为，领导上应发动群众，予以制止。同时首要分子应由政府依法惩办。并告诉群众：政府坚决保护群众在土改中的既得利益，安定群众情绪，放心送粪，及时种麦。如果熟视无睹，或借口团结各阶层生产而拖延不管，都会造成严重的错误。
