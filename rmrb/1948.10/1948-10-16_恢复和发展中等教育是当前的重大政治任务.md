　　Restoring and Developing Secondary Education is a Major Political Task of the Present
　　The most important issue in the current ordinary education work in the liberated areas is the restoration and development of secondary education. Since our army turned to the offensive last July, the great victories we have achieved militarily are reflected in the educational work, namely, the number of schools in the liberated areas has greatly increased. This victory, and the task of further striving for national victory, has placed new demands on educational work, requiring it to cultivate a large number of politically progressive talents with secondary education and basic scientific knowledge to supplement cadres in military, political, economic, and cultural work. This is a major political task, and if it cannot be solved well, it will hinder the victory of the war and the construction of the country.
　　In the past, our solution to this task was to open short-term political schools or training classes, absorb educated youth, give them necessary political training, and then send them to various work posts. This method is still very important now, and we must continue to do so on a large scale whenever possible. However, this method alone cannot meet the objectively increasing needs. Therefore, we also need, and it is already possible, to train a large number of talents needed for the people's cause through the existing secondary schools in the liberated areas. In the newly liberated areas, it is possible to maintain the original schools and make necessary and possible improvements to enable these schools to continue to cultivate intellectuals so as to absorb them into the people's liberation cause.
　　Recently, North China convened a secondary education conference, and Northeast China convened the third education conference. Both conferences focused on discussing secondary education issues. Both conferences reviewed past achievements and shortcomings, determined future directions, and solved many specific problems. This is very necessary.
　　To run secondary education well, four issues must be resolved: (1) educational guidelines and teaching methods; (2) textbooks; (3) teachers; (4) funding.
　　Regarding the direction of secondary schools, the two education conferences in North China and Northeast China have made correct resolutions. That is: middle schools must be standardized, that is, there must be an entrance and graduation system, a certain period of study, class hours, vacation dates, and other formal school systems. On the issue of the school system, the old school system has many shortcomings, but it would be premature and unprepared to make a comprehensive reform now. Therefore, the middle schools in the liberated areas should generally still adopt the three-three system. North China stipulates that in addition to the three-year junior high school, one-year accelerated classes should also be run. The school system of normal schools in North China also adopts a method of three years as the main and one year as the auxiliary, while Northeast China adopts two types of four years and two years. On the issue of curriculum, for middle schools, both North China and Northeast China have decided that cultural courses account for 90% and political courses account for 10%. Northeast China has also decided that the curriculum of normal schools will consist of 70% to 75% cultural courses, 15% to 20% professional courses, and 10% political courses. Regarding teaching methods, both North China and Northeast China emphasized the importance of classroom teaching and teacher guidance, while opposing dogmatic and cramming methods. Regarding collective learning, on the one hand, the necessity of it within a certain scope was pointed out, and on the other hand, the abuse of so-called collective learning was emphatically opposed, stipulating that collective discussions should only be held once a week on average. Regarding students' extracurricular social activities, on the one hand, its necessity was also pointed out; on the other hand, excessive social activities were opposed, so as not to hinder classes, and it was stipulated that extracurricular activities should not exceed six or eight hours per week, so as not to hinder classes and self-study. Regarding school management, North China has determined the principal system, with the principal responsible to the government. For the management of new democratic schools, a method roughly the same as the factory management committee should be adopted, that is, under the leadership of the principal, a school management committee should be organized by the school's main faculty and staff, plus student representatives (one or two), to uniformly lead all the work of the school. Although some of these methods still need to be tested in practice, they are generally appropriate.
　　The textbook problem is the basic key problem of school education. It should be pointed out that in this regard, we still lack preparation, and we should concentrate all possible forces to solve it quickly. Before it is resolved, in order to cope with the emergency, we have to use the old textbooks. For subjects that are not related to politics, we should select better old textbooks, make necessary deletions and revisions, and apply them temporarily, and then revise or rewrite them comprehensively when it is possible in the future. However, some subjects, such as politics, history, and Chinese, must be compiled with new teaching materials. This compilation must be scientific and consistent with the students' level and teaching progress. After the educational policy has been determined, the task of solving the textbook problem becomes the most important task and must be worked hard to solve.
　　The issue of teachers in secondary schools includes the source of teachers and their political and living treatment. The source of teachers, first, we should try our best to employ the original teachers, second, we should conduct necessary supplementary training for the existing part of the teachers to improve their political and cultural level, and third, we should also try to train new teachers. Educational work is an important and arduous task, especially during the war, there are many inconveniences. The government should appropriately improve the political and living treatment of education workers, and practically help them overcome the various difficulties they encounter in life and work, so that they can work with peace of mind.
　　The last important issue is the issue of education funding. Now is the time of war, and education funding is naturally difficult. However, in order to run secondary schools well and cultivate educated youth, the governments of the liberated areas should allocate a certain amount of determined funding in the budget for education. In order to train the necessary and urgent talents, this funding should be squeezed out. This funding should be placed within the budget of all necessary funding. At the same time, in order to take into account the difficulties of funding, when formulating education plans, we must do what we can and concentrate our efforts to run a part of the schools well first; when schools encounter difficulties, we should still advocate overcoming difficulties by ourselves without hindering learning. And students should carry the grain they eat themselves when possible. When the government considers education funding, in addition to universities and secondary schools, it must of course include the funding for senior and junior primary schools, as well as urban and rural social education. In the consolidated liberated areas, the work of junior and senior primary schools and urban and rural social education must be rectified, which goes without saying.
　　In the entire education work, the New Democratic Youth League has the responsibility to help the government run education well, and to unite teachers and students in the school, unite classmates, and strengthen learning.
　　At present, the school education work in the liberated areas is best in North China and Northeast China, so they can hold education conferences and solve many problems of secondary education. In addition, the Northwest and Jin Sui are recovering after war and famine; East China has always been developed in education, and is also actively recovering after repelling the Chiang bandit's key offensive. The Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning area has serious disasters; the Central Plains area is still a war zone, and the objective conditions there are temporarily difficult to make high demands. In view of this situation, the two liberated areas of Northeast China and North China should take a great responsibility to provide other liberated areas with their experience in education work, and help other liberated areas solve the problem of training cadres.

### 恢复和发展中等教育是当前的重大政治任务

　　恢复和发展中等教育是当前的重大政治任务
    当前解放区普通教育工作中最重要的问题，是恢复和发展中等教育问题。自从去年七月我军转入进攻以来，我们在军事上所取得的伟大胜利，反映在教育工作上是解放区的学校数目是更大地增加了；这个胜利，以及进一步争取全国胜利的任务，又对教育工作提出了新的要求，要求教育工作能够培养出大批政治上进步的具有中等文化程度和基本科学知识的人才，来补充军事、政治、经济、文化各方面工作的干部。这是一个重大的政治任务，如果不能很好地解决这个任务，就会妨碍战争的胜利与国家的建设。
    以往，我们解决这个任务的办法，是开设短期的政治性的学校或训练班，吸收知识青年，加以必要的政治训练之后，派往各种工作岗位。这个办法，现在依然还很重要，只要有可能，就必须继续地大量地这样办。但是，仅仅这个办法，不能满足客观上日益增长的需要。因此，我们还有必要，而且已经也有可能，经过解放区已有的中等学校来训练大批人民事业所需用的人才。在新解放区，则可能用维持原有学校，加以必要与可能的改良的方法，使这些学校继续培养知识分子，以便吸收他们为人民的解放事业服务。
    最近，华北召开了中等教育会议，东北召开了第三次教育会议，这两次会议，都着重讨论了中等教育问题。两个会议，都检讨了过去的成绩和缺点，确定了将来的方针，解决了许多具体问题。这是很有必要的。
    要办好中等教育，必须解决这样四个问题：（一）教育方针和教学方法；（二）教科书；（三）师资；（四）经费。
    关于中等学校的方针问题，华北东北两个教育会议都作了正确的解决。这就是：中学必须正规化，即是必须有入学和毕业的制度，有一定的修业期限，上课时间，放假日期等各种正规学校的制度。在学制问题上，旧的学制是有很多缺点的，但是如果现在就加以通盘改革，则是过早的和没有准备的，因此，现在解放区的中学一般仍应采用三三制，华北则规定除三年制的初中以外还办一年制的速成班。师范学校的学制，华北也采取了三年制为主、一年制为辅的办法，东北则采取了四年制与二年制两种。在课程问题上，对于中学，华北和东北都决定文化课占百分之九十，政治课占百分之十；东北又决定师范学校的课程，文化课占百分之七十到七十五，业务课占百分之十五到二十，政治课占百分之十。关于教学方法问题，华北东北都强调了必须重视课堂教学及教师指导的作用，同时反对教条主义的和填鸭式的办法。关于集体学习问题，一方面指出了它的一定范围内的必要性，另一方面又着重地反对了滥用所谓集体学习，规定平均每周只应举行一次集体讨论。关于学生进行课外社会活动问题，也一方面指出了它的必要性；另一方面，又反对了进行过多的社会活动，以致妨碍上课，作了课外活动每周不超过六小时或八小时的规定，以免妨碍上课和自修。关于学校的管理，华北确定了校长制，由校长对政府负责。对于新民主主义的学校管理，应该采用与工厂管理委员会大体相同的办法，即在校长领导下由学校主要教职员再加学生代表（一人或二人）组织学校管理委员会，统一领导学校的一切工作。以上这些办法，虽然其中有些还待实际的考验，但总的说来是恰当的。
    教科书问题，是学校教育的基本关键问题。应该指出，在这方面，我们还缺乏准备，现在应该集中一切可能的力量迅速予以解决。在未解决以前，为了应急起见，不得不利用旧有的教科书，对于无关政治的课目，应该选择较好的旧教科书，加以必要的删改，暂时应用，待将来有了可能，再来通盘修改或重编。但是有些课目，例如政治、历史、国文，则必须编辑新的教材，这种编写，必须是合于科学的，并且合于学生程度与教学进度的。在教育方针已经决定之后，解决教科书的任务就成为最重要的任务，必须努力解决。
    中等学校的师资问题，包括师资的来源，及对他们政治上与生活上的待遇。师资的来源，第一应尽量任用原有教员，第二应对现有一部分教员进行必要的补充训练，以提高他们的政治水平、文化水平，第三还应设法训练新的师资。教育工作是一项重要而艰苦的工作，在战争期间特别有许多不便。政府应当适当地改善教育工作人员的政治待遇和生活待遇，切实帮助他们克服在生活上和工作中所遇到的各种困难，以便他们能够安心工作。
    最后一个重要问题，就是教育经费问题。现在正是战争时期，教育经费自然是困难的。但是为了办好中等学校，培养知识青年，各解放区政府应该在预算中划出一部分确定的经费，作为教育之用。为了训练必需的急用的人才，应当挤出此项经费。将此项经费置于一切必要经费的预算之内。同时，为了顾到经费的困难，在制定教育计划时，要量力而行，集中力量首先办好一部分学校；在学校发生困难时，仍应在不妨碍学习的情况下，提倡自己动手克服困难。并应在可能条件下要学生携带自己所食用的粮食。在政府考虑教育经费时，除大学及中等学校以外，当然必须把高小初小的经费，以及城市乡村社会教育的经费计算在内。在巩固的解放区，初小高小和城乡社会教育工作必须有所整顿，这是不待多说的。
    在整个教育工作中，新民主主义青年团有责任帮助政府，办好教育，并在校内团结师生，团结同学，加强学习。
    现在各解放区的学校教育工作，以华北和东北的条件为最好，所以他们能举行教育会议，解决中等教育的许多问题。除此以外，西北和晋绥，在战争与灾荒之后，学校正在恢复中；华东教育素来发达，在打退了蒋匪重点进攻之后，也正在积极恢复。冀热辽地区有严重的灾荒；中原地区现在仍是战区，那里的客观条件，暂时还难于有过高的要求。鉴于这种情况，东北和华北两个解放区，应当负起很大的责任，供给其他解放区以自己在教育工作中的经验，并帮助其他解放区解决培养干部问题。（新华社陕北十四日电）
