Digging for Gold Ingots (New Folk Tale)
(Adapted by Kang Tuo)

　　There was a man who loved to work from a young age. He lived an honest, hard-working life, saving every penny. He acquired several acres of land and lived a pretty good life. However, his two sons and two daughters-in-law spent their days loafing around, only eating and never working. The old man tried his best to persuade and educate them, but he couldn't reform them. He had no choice but to hire two farmhands and work alongside them, working his life away to support his sons and daughters-in-law. As a result, the sons and daughters-in-law became even lazier, even requiring the farmhands to bring them food and water, and still complaining about the quality of the food. The old man thought: "Is there really no way to educate these four men and women?" He could only sigh, swallow his anger, and say to himself: "Maybe I just owe them this from a previous life!" After saying that, he went back to work in the fields.

　　Later, the Communist Eighth Route Army liberated this area. The village implemented land reform. The villagers held a meeting to discuss the class status of each family, and this family was classified as a rich peasant family. The head of the farmers' association said to the old man: "This is the consensus of everyone: To be honest, you are a good, hardworking man. If your sons and daughters-in-law were like you, you would only be a good middle peasant. But because your sons and daughters-in-law don't work and exploit and oppress the farmhands, your family has become a rich peasant family. Do you have any objections?" The old man said: "Everyone's words are correct! I agree with every one of them, and have no objections." Later, the village held a struggle meeting. The two farmhands even complained about their suffering at the hands of the sons and daughters-in-law. The masses also criticized the four men and women severely. The old man, seeing this, not only didn't feel sorry for them, but even grinned and said: "Serves them right! Serves them right!"

　　At this time, his family no longer had farmhands. The masses left them enough land for a middle peasant family to subsist on and confiscated the rest of their land and property. The four men and women realized that if they didn't work, they wouldn't have anything to eat, so they had no choice but to go to the fields with the old man. However, they really couldn't endure it! After digging a few times, they felt dizzy and their hearts raced. Their palms were cut and bleeding, and their legs were so sore they couldn't stand. They would work a little, then rest a lot, relying solely on the old man to work.

　　The old man was really old, and his body couldn't take it anymore! One morning, the old man was lying in bed and couldn't get up. He knew that he had contracted an old age disease that couldn't be cured. He thought: "It's better to die! If I die, my sons and daughters-in-law will lose their natural support. Let the villagers educate them and guide them to improve!" After thinking this, the old man called his sons and daughters-in-law to his side and said: "I see that I'm not going to make it! From now on, you must work hard and produce to support yourselves!" Seeing this scene, the sons and daughters-in-law couldn't help but cry. One cried: "How will we live from now on!" Another cried: "Who will we rely on from now on!" Still another cried: "Our backs ache and our legs hurt, we really can't do the work!" The old man was annoyed by their crying. After thinking for a while, he said: "Now, if you don't work, you won't survive. You have to endure it! Alas! My sons and daughters-in-law! Listen to me: I still have ten large gold ingots. I was afraid you would squander them, so I didn't tell you before, but you are my flesh and blood after all! I won't hide it from you any longer! Remember, children! The ingots are buried scattered in the east, west, north, and south of our eight-acre field in the east of the village. You have to slowly endure the hardship. If you can't endure it and don't have enough to eat, then go dig up an ingot to help yourselves. But you are only allowed to dig up one a year! Ten ingots will help you for ten years, and you will definitely make it through! You will learn to work! Children, remember this!" After the old man finished speaking, he died.

　　The sons and daughters-in-law were very happy to hear the old man's words. After arranging the funeral for the old man, they discussed the matter of digging for gold ingots. They agreed to dig out all ten ingots and eat them all up first. They were also afraid that the villagers would see them digging and confiscate some of the ingots, so they agreed to go digging every night.

　　From that day on, the four of them, each with a hoe, dug in that eight-acre field for ten whole nights. They dug even when their backs ached, they dug even when their legs were sore, they dug even when their palms were cut, and they dug even when they felt dizzy. They didn't rest at all, thinking that everything would be fine once they dug out the gold ingots! Who knew that on the tenth night, when dawn was breaking, and the eight-acre field had been completely dug up, they still couldn't find any gold ingots. Just as the four of them were about to go back, the head of the farmers' association came to the field early in the morning with his hoe. When the head of the farmers' association saw them, he said: "Haha! I was just wondering who was digging up this field these past two days! So it was you digging all night! Good! This is what your old man's sons and daughters-in-law should be like! What are you planning to plant? Don't you have seeds? Fine! I'll lend you some." The four of them hurriedly agreed. Later, they carefully turned over the dug-up field again for three nights, searching for three nights, but still couldn't find any gold ingots. At this time, the head of the farmers' association gave them seeds, and they had no choice but to plant the field. Later, the head of the farmers' association also urged them to fertilize, thin the seedlings, and weed the field. They regretted it immensely, but at this point, they no longer felt back pain or leg soreness when working in the fields, they didn't feel dizzy, and their palms didn't get cut anymore. They went to the fields every day. In the autumn, this eight-acre field yielded twenty dan of grain.

　　The four men and women still hadn't given up on the ten gold ingots and wanted to continue digging. Later, the head of the farmers' association somehow found out about their plans and ran to them and said: "Haha! 'Gold at home needs to be weighed outside!' If your old man had gold ingots, wouldn't I know about it? There are no gold ingots! The old man was telling you to work hard, and labor is gold! Isn't that right! This eight-acre field alone yields twenty dan of grain a year, how much is that worth in gold ingots? Haha!" The four men and women finally came to their senses and shouted in unison: "Ah! That's right! That's right!" After saying that, the four of them went back to the fields.

　　刨元宝（新民间故事）
    （康濯改编）
    有一个人，从小爱好劳动，一辈子实打实受，省吃俭用，置下顷数来地，光景挺不赖。不想他两个儿子两个媳妇都是整天游游荡荡，光吃不干，老头子紧打劝慢训导，也教化不过来，只得雇了两个长工，自己跟长工卖命动弹，养活儿子媳妇。这一来，儿子媳妇更懒了，连吃饭喝水的也要长工送到手里，还短不了说个饭不好，菜不强的。老头子想：这世道敢是没法教化好这四个男女啦！他只得叹息一声，忍住一口气，自己对自己说：“就算是我前世该欠下他们的！”说完，就又上地去了。
    后来，共产党八路军解放了这块地面，村里实行土地改革，老百姓开会讨论成份，就把这家订成了个富农。农会主任对老头子说：“大伙是这么个意见：要说你嘛，可是个好受苦人，你儿子媳妇若是都跟你一样，你也只是个好中农；可就是你儿子媳妇不动弹，还剥削压迫长工，你家就成了富农了。你有什么意见？”老头子说：“大伙的话一个对！我一个赞成，没意见。”后来村里开斗争大会，两个长工还对这儿子媳妇诉了苦，群众也把这四个男女批评得不轻；老头子见了那模样，不光不心疼，还裂着嘴笑道：“该！该！”
    这时他家长工也没有了，群众给他们五口留下了够个中农的地，就征收了他家多余的土地财产；四个男女眼看不动弹就没的吃，只好跟着老头子上地去。可是，他们真觉着熬不住！刨两下就头晕心发跳，巴掌擦破皮出了血，腿酸痛得立不住。他们就干干歇歇，光靠老头子受。
    老头子实在老了，身子骨不抵了！有一天早晨，老头子竟躺在炕上起不来了。他知道自己害上了年老病，没法治的，心想：死了也好！死了，就去了儿子媳妇天生的靠山，让村里大伙教化他们往好里改吧！想完了，老头子就把儿子媳妇叫到跟前说道：“我眼看是不行了！往后，你们自己好好劳动生产，养活自己吧！”儿子媳妇看着这个光景，不觉都啼哭起来，这个哭道：“往后俺们怎么过啊！”那个哭道：“往后俺们靠谁啊！”还有的哭道：“俺们腰酸腿痛的可真个做不了营生啊！”老头子听着心烦，想了想，就说：“这如今不动弹就没活路，你们紧着慢着熬着受吧！唉！儿子儿媳妇啊！你们听着：我还有十个大元宝，早先怕你们胡花，不敢告给你们，可你们到底是我的肉啊！我也不瞒着啦！记着，孩子们！元宝都在村东俺们八亩坪那块地里东西南北散埋着；你们慢慢熬慢慢受，受不住了，吃不上了，就去刨个元宝帮补点。可你们只许一年刨一个！十个元宝帮补你们十年，你们准受出来啦！会动弹啦！孩子，好好记住啊！”老头子说完就死了。
    儿子媳妇们听了老头子的话，都很高兴，把老头子安丧了，就商量刨元宝的事。他们商定先把十个元宝刨出来吃了再说；他们又怕刨的时候村里人们看见了要征收几个去，就又商定每天黑夜去刨。
    就从这天起，他们四个人，一人一把镢头，在那块八亩大小的八亩坪地里，整整刨了十个黑夜。他们腰痛了也刨，腿酸了也刨，巴掌破了也刨，头晕了也刨，一点也不歇，都想着刨出元宝来就好啦！谁知刨到第十黑夜，眼看天也亮了，八亩坪刨得一点也不剩了，都还不见元宝。四人正要回去，不想农会主任这么早就扛着镢头下地；农会主任见了他们就说：“哈哈！这两天我正猜摸这地是谁们怎么刨的哩！原来就是你们连夜刨呀！好！这才象你们老头子的儿子媳妇！我说你们种什么？你们没籽种？行！我给你们借点。”四人慌慌张张地只得随口答应了。后来他们又仔仔细细把刨过的地再翻了三夜寻了三夜，还是没有元宝。这时农会主任又给了他们籽种，他们只好把地种上；以后农会主任又督促他们奶粪、拣苗、锄草的，他们后悔得不行，好在这会上地也都不觉得腰痛腿酸了，头也不晕了，巴掌也磨不破了，就每天上地去。到秋天，这八亩坪打了二十担谷子。
    他们四个男女对那十个元宝还是不死心，还想再往下刨刨。后来农会主任不知怎么知道了他们的事，就跑去对他们说：“哈哈！家有黄金外有秤！你们老头子要有元宝，我还能不知道？没有元宝的！老头子是叫你们好好劳动，劳动就是元宝！这不是！光这块八亩坪，一年打二十担谷子的，这顶多少元宝？哈哈！”这四个男女这时才清醒过来，齐声嚷道：“啊！真对！真对！”说完，四人就又上地去了。
