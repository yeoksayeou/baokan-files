　　What is the Mao Zedong Youth League?
    Question: After the land reform, some villages established "Youth Leagues." What are the tasks of the Youth League? How can one join? Please explain. Also, regarding the organization of school-age children, there are no definite regulations. Some are organized from seven to seventeen years old, and some are organized from six full years to fourteen years old. The remaining fifteen to seventeen-year-olds, males are assigned to the "Youth League," and females are assigned to the Women's Federation. What are the regulations for these children's and youth organizations? (Li Shuanyi, Second District, Yangquan City)
    Answer: Regarding the Youth League and school-age children issues, we have requested the North China Youth Work Committee to reply as follows:
    1. The Youth League (i.e., the New Democratic Youth League, also called the Mao Zedong Youth League, the name is not yet unified) is a mass organization of active young people, playing a core and backbone role in general youth mass organizations. There are certain conditions for joining the League. Not all young people who meet the age requirement are included in the Youth League; nor is it that anyone who wants to join the Youth League is considered a member. There are certain organizational procedures. After requesting to join the League on a voluntary basis, it must be reviewed and approved by the superior League committee before becoming a member. The age for joining the Youth League is generally temporarily set from fifteen to twenty-five years old. (The Youth League Charter will be announced soon.)
    2. Regarding the age issue of school-age children, it is extremely difficult to unify due to different lifestyles and cultural levels in various regions (I don't know if the Ministry of Education has new unified regulations). Generally, those from six or seven years old to thirteen or fourteen years old are in the children's learning period.
    3. The Youth League has not yet been universally established. In established areas, primary schools do not establish Youth Leagues. If there are young people who meet the age and conditions, they can participate in the village's Youth League, but the Youth League will never interfere with school administration, only have the obligation to assist the school to improve through its members. After the establishment of a League in senior primary school, members will participate in the activities of the school organization, and only with the introduction of the district League committee can they participate in the activities of the village League during holidays.

### 什么是毛泽东青年团？

专栏：询问与答复

　　什么是毛泽东青年团？
    问：土改后，有些村庄建立“青年团”，青年团的任务是什么？怎样参加？请解释。另外关于学龄儿童的编制上，也没有个一定的规定，有的按七岁至十七岁编制，有的按六足岁至十四岁编制。其余的十五至十七岁者，男者归“青年团”编制，女者归妇联会编制，这些儿童与青年组织到底怎样规定？（阳泉市二区李拴义）
    答：关于青年团与学龄儿童问题，我们已请华北青年工作委员会答复如下：
    一、青年团（即新民主主义青年团，也有叫毛泽东青年团的，名称尚不统一）是青年积极分子的群众组织，在一般的青年群众组织中起核心骨干作用。入团有一定的条件，不是够着年龄的青年就都编到青年团里去；也不是谁想参加青年团就算是团员，有一定的组织手续，在其自觉自愿的基础上提出要求参加团以后，必须经过审查，上级团委的批准，才能成为团员。入青年团的青年年龄一般暂定从十五到二十五岁。（不久要公布青年团团章）
    二、关于学龄儿童的年龄问题，因各地生活习惯文化程度不一，所以极难一致（不知教育部有否新的统一规定），一般从六七岁到十三四岁的都系儿童学习时期。
    三、青年团尚未普遍建立，已建立地区，凡初小不建立青年团，其中若有够年龄够条件的青年，就可参加村里的青年团，但青年团决不干涉学习行政，只有通过团员协助学校把学校搞好的义务。高小建团后，团员就参加学校团体的活动，放假的时候由区团委的介绍才参加村里的团的活动。
