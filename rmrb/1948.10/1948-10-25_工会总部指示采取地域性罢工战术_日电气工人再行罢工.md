Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd -- According to a Reuters report from Tokyo: The Japanese Electrical Workers' Union ordered its local branches on the evening of the 17th to stage strikes again, because the thirty-day cooling-off period stipulated by the Japanese government in "mediating" wage disputes (meaning workers are restricted from taking action within thirty days of announcing a strike, to await the government's "mediation." This is a tactic to undermine workers' strikes.) had expired. More than 3,000 members of the Tokyo branch held a rally in Hibiya Park in the early ten days of the month, passing a resolution to launch a labor offensive and hold a large-scale power outage strike to achieve wage increase demands. After the meeting, they marched in formation through the city to demonstrate in front of the Diet building and the Prime Minister's residence. Workers from the Kyushu (one of Japan's four main islands) branch took action first when the cooling-off period expired on the evening of the 17th, cutting off power for 24 hours. On the evening of the 18th, short power outage strikes occurred successively in major cities such as Kagoshima, Miyazaki, Fukuoka, Saga, and Oita (all located on Kyushu Island). When issuing the strike order, the Electrical Workers' Union headquarters instructed to adopt independent, regional strike tactics to counter MacArthur's ban on national strikes in important industries. The chairman of the Labor Relations Committee issued a broadcast at the end of the cooling-off period, admitting that the wage issue had not even been discussed because the government insisted on "compulsory arbitration" and the union refused to agree. Currently, the Japanese police authorities have openly ordered their subordinates to prepare to suppress the upcoming strike.

　　工会总部指示采取地域性罢工战术
  　日电气工人再行罢工
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据路透社东京讯：日本电气工会于十七日晚下令各地分会再行罢工，因为日本政府在“调停”工资纠纷中所约定的三十天冷隙（按即限制工人在宣布罢工后三十天内不得执行，以静待政府的“调停”。这是破坏工人罢工的手段之一。）期限已满。东京分会会员三千人于十余日在日比谷公园举行大会，通过发动劳工攻势，举行大规模停电罢工，以达到增资要求的决议。会后列队游行，经市区至议会大楼及首相官邸前示威。九州（日本四大岛之一）分会工人于十七日晚冷隙期满时首先行动，停电二十四小时。十八日晚，鹿儿岛、宫崎、福冈、佐贺、大分（均位于九州岛上）等较大城市，相继发生短促的停电罢工。电气工会总部在发布罢工令时，曾指示采取独立的、地域性的罢工战术，以对付麦克阿瑟不准重要工业全国性罢工的禁令。劳资关系委员会主席于冷隙期满时发表广播，承认由于政府坚持“强制仲裁”而工会拒绝同意，甚至工资问题都未曾讨论。现日本警察当局已公然下令所属准备镇压到来的罢工。
