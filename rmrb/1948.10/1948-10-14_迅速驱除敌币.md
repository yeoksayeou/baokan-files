　　Rapidly Expel Enemy Currency
　　Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang announced the so-called "currency reform," the developments over the past month have fully exposed the wild and plundering nature of the so-called "currency reform," and fully proved that the fake "Gold Yuan" will inevitably collapse as rapidly as the fake "Legal Tender." In the past month or so, in order to save its financial and economic collapse, the reactionaries, in addition to abolishing the "Legal Tender," have adopted all kinds of high-pressure policies to force the people to exchange their gold, silver, and U.S. dollars for worthless "Gold Yuan," forced the freezing of prices, and confiscated the property, arrested, tried, and even executed people who violated the so-called "Economic Emergency Measures," in an attempt to achieve their goal of plundering wealth and the illusion of stabilizing prices. However, the result of all high-pressure methods has been the continued rise in prices, the continued development of the black market, the continued flight of funds, the closure of many shops and factories in major cities, the reduction of business, the shortage of goods in the market, and even panic buying in places like Beijing and Shanghai, which are under the strictest control, forcing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to admit the failure of the so-called "currency reform." Now, the amount of fake "Gold Yuan" issued, as stated in today's news report from this agency, has suddenly increased tenfold compared to the fake "Legal Tender," and will inevitably continue to expand. Therefore, the price increase in the future will inevitably become more intense, and those who hold the fake Gold Yuan will suffer more serious losses. As for the fake Legal Tender held by the broad masses, because the redemption period is near, it will completely turn into waste paper in the short term.
　　In this situation, the governments and people in the liberated areas must use high vigilance to deal with the enemy currency that is flooding like a flood. In order to prevent the Chiang bandits from plundering and protect the people's wealth, we must take the following emergency measures.
　　First, we must quickly expel enemy currency in our newly liberated areas and prevent fake Legal Tender and fake Gold Yuan from entering our areas. In these places, we should take appropriate steps to help the people expel enemy currency and reduce the people's difficulties, but we must focus on organizing the people to expel it themselves. It is necessary to educate the people in the newly liberated areas to cherish the local currency issued by the democratic government, and assist the government in quickly establishing a solid and independent local currency market, so that the wealth of the people in the liberated areas will no longer be plundered by the Chiang bandits' inflation policy.
　　Second, we must resolutely crack down on the Chiang bandits' conspiracy to plunder gold, silver, and materials. The Chiang bandits use their worthless fake Gold Yuan to forcibly buy our people's gold, silver, and silver dollars; we must prevent gold and silver from flowing into the enemy area, so we must stop the free trading of gold and silver in some areas, and strictly prevent profiteers from smuggling gold and silver out of the country to aid the enemy. The democratic government allows the people to store gold and silver, but does not allow it to be used in the market. If it needs to be sold, it must be redeemed by our banks to prevent profiteers from buying gold and silver to aid the enemy. At the same time, we must prevent the enemy from issuing fake currency indiscriminately to obtain important materials such as grain and cotton in our border areas. All exports from all liberated areas must be tightly controlled by state-owned trading companies, and absolutely no enemy currency is allowed to be exchanged.
　　Third, the governments, banks, and trading companies in the border areas must regard currency struggle as one of the central tasks at present, and recognize that this is a major political task to protect the wealth of the government and the people. We must use various methods (such as market propaganda and holding forums for merchants, etc.) to widely publicize the Chiang bandits' conspiracy and fraud of "currency reform" and the correct policies of the democratic government from the people's own interests, eliminate any possible misunderstandings of the people, and organize the people to quickly exclude enemy currency, especially the fake Legal Tender and fake Northeast Nine Provinces Circulation Certificates that are about to become waste paper completely. We must strengthen the anti-smuggling work of the masses in the border areas to prevent the inflow of enemy currency and the outflow of gold, silver, and materials, and coordinate economic struggles with military and political struggles to protect the interests of the people and the interests of the revolutionary war.

### 迅速驱除敌币

　　迅速驱除敌币
    自从蒋介石匪帮宣布所谓“货币改革”以来，一个多月事实的发展，已经充分暴露了所谓“货币改革”的野蛮的掠夺性，充分证明了伪“金圆券”必然继伪法币之后同样地迅速崩溃。一个多月以来，反动派为着挽救其财政经济的崩溃，除废除“法币”外，曾采用一切高压政策来强迫人民用金银美钞去换不值钱的“金圆券”，强迫冻结物价，对违反所谓“经济紧急处分令”的人民实行没收财产以至逮捕审判处死，企图达到其掠夺财富的目的和稳定物价的幻想。但是一切高压办法的结果，却是物价的继续上涨，黑市的继续发展，资金的继续逃避，各大城市许多商店工厂的关门关厂，缩小营业，市场货物的缺乏，以至管制最严的京、沪等地也发生抢购风潮，迫使蒋介石集团承认所谓“币改”的失败。现在伪“金圆券”的发行数量，正如本社今日电讯所说，已比伪“法币”骤增十倍，而且必将继续膨胀。因此今后物价的上涨必将更趋激烈，持有伪金圆券的人们必将受更严重的损失。至于广大群众所持有的伪法币，因为停兑期近，在短期内更将完全变为废纸。
    在这个情况下，解放区的政府和人民，必须用高度的警惕，来对付象洪水般泛滥着的敌币。为着防止蒋匪的掠夺，和保护人民的财富，我们必须采取下列紧急措施。
    第一，在我新解放区必须迅速驱除敌币，并防止伪法币和伪金圆券侵入我区，在这些地方，我们应当采取适当步骤帮助人民驱逐敌币，减少人民的困难，但必须以组织人民自己来驱逐为主。必须教育新解放区的人民爱护民主政府所发行的本币，协助政府迅速建立巩固的独立自主的本币市场，使解放区的人民财富，再不致被蒋匪的通货膨胀政策所掠夺。
    第二，必须坚决打击蒋匪掠夺金银，掠夺物资的阴谋。蒋匪用其不值钱的伪金圆券，来强制收买我人民的金银和银元；我们必须防止金银流入敌区，因此就必须停止某些地区金银的自由买卖，并严防奸商私运金银外流资敌。民主政府准许人民贮藏金银，但不准在市场行使，如须出售必须一律由我银行收兑，以免奸商收买金银资敌。同时必须防止敌人滥发伪币，在我边沿地区套取粮食棉花等类重要物资。一切解放区的一切输出必须由公营贸易公司严密掌握，绝对不准换回敌币。
    第三，各边沿区的政府，银行，贸易公司必须把货币斗争作为目前之一中心工作，认识这是保护政府和人民财富之一重大政治任务。必须采用各种方式（如集市宣传和开商人座谈会等）从人民切身利害来广泛宣传蒋匪“货币改革”的阴谋骗局和民主政府的正确政策，扫除人民任何可能有的误解，组织人民迅速排挤敌币，尤其是即将完全成为废纸的伪法币和伪东北九省流通券。必须加强边沿区的群众缉私工作，防止敌币的内流。和金银物资的外流，并把经济斗争与军事政治的斗争相配合，以保障人民的利益，保障革命战争的利益。
