(Central Hebei Electric) Oil grasshoppers have been discovered in Xiong'nan County (newly established county), Hebei, damaging wheat fields. County and district cadres are leading the masses to catch and kill them. In thirty-odd villages in the first, third, and sixth districts of the county, grasshoppers were discovered successively from the end of September to the beginning of October. At that time, farmers were busy planting wheat and threshing grain, so they did not pay attention to it. After learning about this situation, the county committee of the county sent people to the villages to investigate and understand the situation, and helped the districts and villages study methods of catching and killing them. At the same time, it instructed all districts to seize the opportunity to catch them after discovering grasshoppers. After receiving the instructions from the county committee, the district committee of the sixth district and the district head personally went to the fields to inspect and convened a meeting of district cadres to study how to lead the masses to catch and kill them. The district first carried out publicity and deliberation. The district committee went to the mass gathering places and small shops in Lizhuangzi to publicize and explain that if they did not seize the opportunity to catch and kill them, the wheat seedlings would be eaten, and the harvest would be reduced next year. If the locusts are left behind, there will be locust plagues next year. They also convened a meeting of village cadres, first exposing the village cadres' thoughts of paying attention to the autumn harvest and neglecting insect pests, and then specifically studied the method of combining the autumn harvest with the capture and killing. Men plant wheat and kill nymphs, while women and children kill grasshoppers. After the village cadres' thinking was straightened out, their enthusiasm was raised, and propaganda was carried out in groups, creating a wave of locust catching. Eleven villages, including Zhongwang, Gangli, and Daquhe, mobilized a total of 2,897 people in three days, capturing 2,756 catties of grasshoppers. They are continuing to catch and kill them.

　　冀中雄南县发现油蚂蚱
    【冀中电】雄南县（新设县）发现油蚂蚱，损害麦田，县区干部正领导群众捕打。该县一、三、六，三个区三十余村，在九月底到十月初先后发现蚂蚱，当时农民正忙于种麦，打场未引起注意。该县县委了解此情况后，一面派员下乡调查了解，并帮助区村研究捕打办法；一面指示各区发现蚂蚱后，抓紧捕拿。六区接到县委指示后，区委区长亲自下地视察，并召开区干会议，研究如何领导群众捕打。该区先作了宣传酝酿，区委在李庄子凑到群众场里、小铺里宣传解释，说明如不抓紧捕打，吃了麦苗，明年会减少收成。留下蝗子，明年又有蝗灾。并召开了村干部会，首先揭穿村干光顾秋收轻视虫灾的思想，又具体研究结合收秋进行捕打的办法，男种麦打蝻，妇女、儿童打蚂蚱。村干思想打通后，情绪提高，分片展开宣传，造成捕蝗热潮。中旺、港里、大曲河等十一村三天共发动了两千八百九十七人，捕蚂蚱两千七百五十六斤。现正继续捕打。
