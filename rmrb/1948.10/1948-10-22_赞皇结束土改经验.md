Taihang News: After the District Party Committee convened a county committee joint meeting in early August, Zanhhuang County began the work of concluding land reform. In just over half a month, until the busy autumn harvest, sixty-one villages were completed, accounting for one-third of the county's villages. The masses reflected that: the methods are steady, the policies are clear, and they can concentrate on production. At the same time, district and village cadres were trained, paving the way for the smooth conclusion of land reform work after the autumn harvest. What are some important experiences in this process?

I. Formulating a plan on a village-by-village basis is the most important step in the entire process of concluding land reform.

Formulating a plan is the basis for correcting policies and correctly implementing them. It is an extremely meticulous and extremely important task. The time required for this step alone will account for approximately one-third to two-thirds of the entire process. If this step is done well, it is equivalent to completing half of the work of concluding land reform. Some people think that formulating a plan is a simple technical task of filling out forms and calculating numbers, which is completely wrong.

Villages Formulate Plans According to Documents to Revise Class Status

What should the plan include and what issues should be paid attention to? These are the questions that must be resolved before formally proceeding with the conclusion of land reform. Based on the situation at the time, the content of the plan should be: first, register and calculate the "deficit households," including compensating middle peasants, resettling landlords and rich peasants, and adjusting a small number of poor and landless peasants. When carrying out this work, first, it is necessary to strictly examine and revise class statuses in accordance with the central government's documents on class division, without the slightest carelessness. This is the starting point for correcting policies. A slight carelessness in classifying class statuses will inevitably lead to errors in policy treatment. It is necessary to criticize and thoroughly overcome those leftist ideas that are willing to expand the landlord and rich peasant categories, or right-leaning sentiments that are willing to shrink the landlord and rich peasant categories, as well as the muddled concepts of classifying those with more land as landlords and rich peasants, and those with less land as poor and landless peasants. The reasons for past struggles must be specifically investigated and cannot be generalized, conceptual, or simply written as local bullies and evil gentry without specific facts, or simply written as feudal exploitation without details of the situation and time. Only by scientifically and carefully distinguishing and analyzing them can we achieve the goal of winning over and uniting the majority and isolating the extreme minority. Second, the standards for resettlement and compensation must be determined in accordance with the spirit of the August meeting and the specific conditions and living standards of the village, and cannot be generally stipulated. For example, in the plains, where there is more land and higher yields, and the living standard is high, the resettlement and compensation standards should be higher; in mountainous areas, where there is less land, the average yield is low, and the living standard is low, even the middle peasants cannot completely maintain their livelihood through land income and must rely on other side businesses to supplement it. The resettlement and compensation standards in these villages should be lower, and it is impossible to simply reach a standard sufficient to maintain livelihood from the land alone. Mountain areas generally have income from fruit trees, and in some villages this accounts for one-third to one-half of the total income. This must be taken into account when resettling and compensating, otherwise, if only the land is considered, even if the average number is reached, it will not be possible to maintain livelihood. For fixed, non-temporary side businesses, handicrafts, and commercial income, it should also be calculated; otherwise, the "deficit" area will be expanded. The compensation calculation for wrongly struggled middle peasants should not exceed the pre-struggle level. At the same time, it must also be appropriately determined according to the amount and nature of the sources. If the sources of official land, temple land, undistributed fruit land, etc., are large, the standard can be appropriately increased; if the sources are cadre-returned excess land, middle peasants voluntarily giving up land, etc., the standard must be appropriately reduced. If there are very few sources at all, the standard can only be lowered, and other methods must be considered, such as interest-free grain loans, etc. It is not possible to expand the sources further, otherwise, there will be danger. Secondly, the entire source must be fully calculated and registered item by item and household by household. Generally, the existing official land, temple land, school land, communal land, land of childless households, undistributed fruit land, and the land of landlords and rich peasants who escaped the net due to various reasons during the movement, or the land of landlords and rich peasants who left too much stubble, should be calculated first. Secondly, calculate the fruit land obviously divided in excess by party members and cadres, the land extracted by middle peasants under the principle of voluntariness, and the land left by immigrants who have settled elsewhere and received their due fruits. However, it is also necessary to leave them the necessary houses and tombs. In short, resettlement, compensation, and adjustment should be carried out based on the principle of "full compensation for the deficit" and based on the overall calculation of the source and the specific investigation of the "deficit households."

What methods should be adopted to formulate the plan? First, strengthen the policy education of party members and non-party members on the conclusion of land reform, and resolve the ideological problems of party members and the masses to make it clear about the purpose of concluding land reform. Then, based on the content that needs to be investigated, the branch should first study a principle based on the village's situation, and then take it to the temporary people's congress, where it should be discussed in detail based on the land register and the fruit register. The entire village should calculate, fill out forms, and make a plan, which should be approved by the higher-level leadership organs before being implemented. Before being approved by higher authorities and passed by the People's Congress, it should be kept secret and not be shouted around to avoid causing confusion among the masses.

II. Combine cadre review with plan formulation at any time, discover problems, solve them in time, and improve cadres' understanding and working ability.

Review the Plan to Discover Problems and Correct Absolute Equalitarianism

What problems were discovered in Zanhhuang in the formulation of the plan? The most important is that the idea of absolute equalitarianism is quite common among district and village cadres, especially village cadres. Specifically, the standard of the average level of the whole village is used to find deficits and compensate. Regardless of whether there are poor peasants or landless peasants in the village, those with low yields are counted as poor peasants and landless peasants and are all given land. The reason is that wrongly struggled middle peasants are compensated, and poor peasants should also turn over a new leaf. In some villages, middle peasants whose land exceeds the village average by one or two dou are also included in the source. Some places count the parts of land that were settled for landlords and rich peasants and compensated for middle peasants that were higher than the average level during the spring and summer correction as sources. In some villages, the area of land affected by middle peasants plus the area of wrongly struggled middle peasants reached more than 30 percent. Some villages had already mobilized 29 percent of the land, but still said that it was still less than 30 percent anyway. Some villages could solve the problem with 10 percent, but still insisted on rushing to 30 percent. All of these are wrong. They completely fail to understand that the smaller the area mobilized, the better, which is more conducive to uniting the majority; they also completely fail to understand that the mobilization of middle peasants must abide by the principle of voluntariness; they do not understand that the purpose of extracting land is to solve problems. This practice of forgetting the principle of compensating for deficits, digging down those with more and filling up those with less, must be thoroughly overcome in the conclusion of land reform in old and semi-old areas, otherwise, the historical mistake of infringing on new and old middle peasants will inevitably be repeated. Secondly, it is also very serious to emphasize that cadres and new middle peasants should return fruits for the purpose of compensation and resettlement. In some villages, party members and cadres pushed to the level line; in some villages, even if they exceeded it by a little, they still had to return it; in some villages, in order to solve the problem, they asked party members and cadres to return more; in some villages, they first calculated the land that party members and cadres and new middle peasants could take out, and if they could solve the problem, they would not look for other sources, and even if middle peasants voluntarily offered land, they would not accept it. All of these reasons are that party members and cadres have a high level of awareness, and new middle peasants have turned over a new leaf under the policies of the party, so they should take out part of the land, which is easier to talk to these people about. They completely ignore the fact that party members and cadres returning fruits refers to the clearly divided excesses; and that they should still maintain a general level (not the village average) after returning the land; the land of new middle peasants should also be the same as that of old middle peasants, and must be based on the principle of absolute voluntariness, and they must be patiently mobilized, and their thinking must be cleared. If this problem is not solved, it will inevitably hit the morale of cadres and seriously hurt the turned-over poor peasants (i.e., new middle peasants), creating new difficulties for future work. Thirdly, the resettlement standards for landlords and rich peasants in some villages are too low to maintain a livelihood. If there are poor peasants who produce more than two dan of grain, they insist that they must fill the land; but if the landlords and rich peasants are settled with one dan and five dou, they think they can maintain a livelihood. This problem must be determined according to the specific conditions of the specific village. Generally speaking, as long as there are conditions to solve the problem, we must resettle them to a standard that can maintain their livelihood so that they can work and live. If the conditions are difficult and the land cannot be adjusted, we should also help them find other ways to produce (such as the government's interest-free grain loans, etc.); otherwise, it may lead to the phenomenon of freezing and starving to death, causing social unrest.

From the above problems, it can be seen that the thinking of some individual party members and cadres is still quite chaotic, and it is difficult to do a good job in concluding land reform without solving these policy ideas. Experience has proved that it is extremely unreliable to think that the problem will be solved after one or several policy education sessions for party members and non-party members. As soon as they come into contact with reality and encounter difficulties, the thinking of party members and cadres will become confused again. When the county party committee approves the plan, it must cooperate with the district cadres (preferably the village cadres of the village concerned should also be present) to study together, and while reviewing and questioning, explain and educate them in conjunction with reality to solve the problems. This is much more effective than raising awareness through education in meetings. It is precisely because these problems were carefully solved when the cadres reviewed the plan that the plans with principled errors were not approved, and no errors were formed in action.

III. Strengthen the activities of the People's Congress, hold fewer mass meetings, and try to avoid wasting the masses' production time.

Use Small Meetings and Hold Fewer Large Meetings to Take Care of the Masses' Production Time

This stage of concluding land reform work is during the production season. It is new work, and there is no experience. Generally, it takes about half a month to do a good job in one village. Even if we have rich experience in the future, I am afraid it will not be less than ten days. This situation proves that the masses do not like or even hate to hold large meetings if the actual problems are not solved. The work of concluding land reform should mainly be carried out by the People's Congress. Therefore, the leadership must strengthen the activities of the People's Congress and hold fewer mass meetings.

During the entire process of concluding land reform, Zanhhuang held only three mass meetings. The first was held on the basis of full preparation by the branch meeting and the expanded village cadre meeting. This meeting publicized the policies and practices of concluding land reform, the nature, powers, and tasks of the People's Congress, as well as the conditions and number of representatives, and elected a temporary People's Congress. The second was to announce the results of the revised class status, announce the village's deficit standards and sources of compensation, and the specific policies for solving these problems. At this meeting, sincere self-criticism was made to the middle peasants who had been struggled against without reason; appropriate criticism was given to the middle peasants who had been struggled against for some reason; the destructive actions of those who were dissatisfied with land reform and who allowed destructive words to disrupt social order were exposed; and the purpose of differentiating, winning over, and isolating a small number of bad elements was achieved. The third was to announce the results of the conclusion of land reform, let the masses freely put forward their opinions, and the leadership explained, revised, and finally passed it, officially determined land rights, declared that they would not be changed again in the future, mobilized all their strength to produce, and proposed to get rich. In short, mass meetings must solve problems.

In order to hold good meetings and solve problems, the activities of the branch meeting, the village cadre meeting, and especially the temporary People's Congress should be frequent and solve problems. The formulation of the plan, the revision of class status, resettlement, compensation, adjustment, and the issuance of land certificates should all be carefully studied by the temporary People's Congress to seek a general solution, and then revised and passed by the mass meeting. Among them, the most troublesome are the issues of middle peasants extracting land and cadres returning excess land under the principle of voluntariness. The People's Congress must use symposiums, family meetings, various systems, group meetings, and individual mobilization, persuasion, and explanation to correctly solve them. We must make full use of small-scale meetings to solve problems and give full play to the power of the temporary People's Congress; otherwise, either party members and cadres will take over, or there will be anarchy and chaos, causing the conclusion of land reform to fail. The Zanhhuang leadership has paid attention to the combined use of large and small meetings from beginning to end, and has tried to avoid wasting the masses' production time as much as possible. This is an important reason for the smooth progress of the work.

IV. In order to avoid detours in concluding land reform, the county party committee leadership must pay attention to three points:

(1) Fully consider the conditions of the villages concluding land reform. Villages where the branch is seriously disunited, cadres are negative, and there are no activists or backbones inside or outside the party cannot proceed. Individual villages were suspended halfway because they did not examine well whether the conditions were met. As the District Party Committee instructed, these villages must first conduct preliminary party rectification, discover activists, and then carry out work when there is a reliance.

(2) The number of base points divided by each district should be determined by the number of backbone cadres. Backbone should be the leader of the base point working group. The allocation of cadres must be determined according to the number of villages around the base point, whether they are easy or difficult to handle, and the strength of the cadres. The original plan was for each village to formulate a plan and then start together after approval, but experience has proved that this cannot be done. We must still start with the base point, be steady and solid, and gradually advance.

(3) A system for reviewing and approving plans must be established, and approval cannot be regarded as a procedure. We must realize that approval is for the purpose of review, and the purpose of review is to correctly and steadily grasp policies. Otherwise, bad results will inevitably be caused. In the beginning, when the District Party Committee had no experience, the County Party Committee could help review and approve the plans separately; after the District Party Committee grasped the policies and gained experience, it should let the District Party Committee review and approve the plans. Otherwise, the County Party Committee will fall into bureaucratism.

　　赞皇结束土改经验
    太行区党委办公室
    【太行讯】八月上旬区党委召开县委联席会议后，赞皇全县开始了结束土改工作。到秋收大忙止，半个多月时间，完成了六十一个村，占全县村庄三分之一。群众反映是：方法稳当，政策明确，安心生产吧。同时锻炼了区村干部，给秋后结束土改工作开辟了顺利的道路。这中间有些什么重要的经验吗？
    一、以村为单位制定方案，是整个结束土改过程中最重要的一个步骤。
    制定方案，是端正政策，正确执行政策的基础，是极其细密而又极其重要的工作。仅这一步所需时间，大约就要占全过程三分之一至三分之二。如果这一步作好了，即等于结束土改工作完成了一半。有些人认为制定方案是填表格，算数字的单纯技术工作，是完全不对的。
    村为单位制订方案按照文件订正成份
    方案如何制定，应包括什么内容，注意些什么问题呢？这是在未正式进行结束土改之前必须解决的问题。根据这段情况，方案的内容应该是：首先登记和计算窟窿户，包括补偿中农，安置地富，调剂少数少地贫雇。在进行这一工作时，第一、必须按照中央划阶级文件，准备审查和改订成份，不得有丝毫马虎，这是端正政策的起点。稍一不慎，成份划错，政策待遇势必错误。对那些愿意扩大地富面的左的思想或愿意缩小地富面的右倾情绪，以及地多就划成地主、富农，地少就划成贫农雇农的糊涂观念，必须批判，彻底克服。对于过去斗争原因，必须具体考查，不能笼统，不能概念，不能只写土棍恶霸而无具体事实，或只写封建剥削而无情况时间。只有科学认真地加以区别和分析，才能达到争取、团结大多数，孤立极少数的目的。第二、安置补偿的标准，必须按照八月会议精神和本村具体情况，生活水平来确定，不能一般的来规定。如平原地多产量大，生活水准高，安置补偿标准就应高些；山区地少，平均产量低，生活水准低，连中农也不能完全凭土地收入维持生活，必须做其他副业来补足，这些村安补标准就应低些，就不能单纯从土地上去达到足以维持生活。山地一般都有果木收入，而且有些村占总收入三分之一与二分之一，安置补偿时就必须计算在内，否则光从土地看，即使达到平均数，也不能维持生活。对于有固定性的非临时的副业，手工业，商业等收入，也应计算在内，否则就要扩大窟窿面。对错斗中农的补偿计算，不得超过斗争前的水平。同时还必须根据来源多少与性质，适当确定。如官地、庙地、未分配果实地等来源多，标准即可适当提高；如是以干部退出多分，中农自动地等作来源，标准就得适当降低。如来源根本很少，就只有降低标准，另想其他办法，如无利贷粮等。不能再去扩大来源，否则就会发生危险。其次，是整个来源要作全盘计算，逐项逐户计算登记。一般应首先计算现存之官地、庙地、学田地、社地、绝户地、未分果实地、以及运动时由于各种原因漏网之地主、富农、或留茬过高之地主、富农土地。其次计算党员干部显然多分之果实地，自愿原则下中农抽出之土地，及移民在他处已经安家，并分得应得果实者所留之土地。但也需给他留出必要的房子与坟地。总之，要根据尽补绽补窟窿的原则，根据来源的全盘计算和窟窿户的具体调查，进行安置、补偿和调剂。
    采取什么方法制订呢？首先是加强党内外结束土改的政策教育，解决党员与群众的思想问题，使之明确结束土改的目的；然后根据所需要调查的内容，先由支部根据本村情况研究出一个原则，再拿到临时人代会上，依据地亩帐，果实帐，详细讨论，全村计算，填写表格，制成方案，经上级领导机关批准后，按照执行。在未经上级批准和人代会通过前、应保持秘密，不应乱嚷，以免引起群众的混乱。
    二、必须随时结合干部审查制定方案，发现问题，及时解决，提高干部的认识和工作能力。
    审查方案发现问题纠正绝对平均主义
    赞皇在制定方案中，发现了些什么问题呢？最主要的是绝对平均主义思想在区村干部中相当普遍，村干部尤为严重。具体表现在以全村平均水准为标准，寻窟窿，找补绽。不管本村有无贫雇，凡产量低者就算贫雇，一律填地。理由是错斗中农还补偿，贫雇也该翻翻身。有些村中农土地较全村水平超出一斗二斗者，也计入来源之内。有些地方把春夏纠偏时安置地富、补偿中农高出水平部分，都算为来源。有些村动中农面加上错斗中农，达百分之卅以上。有些村抽动面已达百分之二十九，还说反正还没有超过百分之三十。有些村本来百分之十即可解决问题，也硬要赶到百分之卅，这些都是错误的。完全不了解动的面越小越好，对团结多数越有利；也完全不了解动员中农必须遵守自愿的原则；不了解抽动是以解决问题为目的。这种忘记了尽补绽补窟窿的原则，多者往下扒，少者往上填的作法，在老区半老区结束土改中，不彻底克服，势必重犯侵犯新老中农的历史错误。其次是为了补偿安置，强调干部、新中农退果实，也很严重。有些村党员干部推到水平线；有些村超过不大一点，也非退不可；有些村为了解决问题，让党员干部退多一些；有些村是首先计算党员干部新中农能拿出的土地，如能解决问题，即不找其他来源，甚至中农自愿拿出土地也不接收。凡此等等，理由是党员干部觉悟高，新中农是在党的政策下翻身的，应该拿出部分土地，对这些人也好张嘴，完全忽视了党员干部退果实是指显然多分的；而且退出地后仍应保有一般水平（不是全村水平）；新中农地也应以与老中农同样，必须是绝对自愿的原则，必须耐心动员，打通思想。这一问题不解决，必然打击干部情绪与严重刺伤翻身贫雇（即新中农），给今后工作造下新的困难。再其次是某些村庄安置地富标准太低，不能维持生活。如果有两石多产粮的贫雇，硬说非填地不行；而地富安置到一石五，就认为能维持生活了。这一问题必须根据具体村的具体条件确定。一般说，只要有解决的条件，一定要安置到能够维持生活的标准，使之能劳动生活。如果条件困难，土地实在无法调剂，也应帮助他取得其他的生产出路（如政府的无利贷粮等）；否则可能形成冻饿至死的现象，造成社会不安。
    从以上这些问题看，某些个别党员干部思想还是相当混乱的，不解决这些政策思想，结束土改是很难搞好的。经验证明，在党内外进行一次或几次政策教育，就认为问题解决了，是极其不可靠的。一接触实际，遇到困难，党员干部思想就会重新混乱起来。县委批准方案时，必须协同区干部（最好该村的村干部也到场）共同研究，一面审查质问，一面进行解释教育，结合实际，解决问题，这比在会议上教育提高要有效得多。正因为在结合干部审查方案时认真解决了这些问题，使有原则错误的方案未能批准，才没有形成行动中的错误。
    三、加强人代会活动，少开群众大会，尽量求得不浪费群众的生产时间。
    运用小会少开大会照顾群众生产时间
    这段结束土改工作，正值生产季节，既无经验，又是新的工作。一般搞好一个村，需时半月左右。即使将来有了丰富的经验，恐也不能少于十天。这段情况证明，不解决实际问题，群众是不喜欢甚至是厌烦开大会的。结束土改的工作，主要应该由人代会来进行。所以领导上必须加强人代会的活动，少开群众大会。
    赞皇在整个结束土过程中，只开了三次群众大会。第一次是在支部会与扩大村干会已有充分准备的基础上召开的。这次大会宣传了结束土改的政策与作法，人代会性质，权力与任务，以及代表条件、数目等，并选出了临时人代会。第二次是公布改订成份结果，宣布本村窟窿标准和补顶来源及解决这些问题的具体政策。这次大会对无理由斗争了的中农作了诚恳的自我批评；对因某些理由斗争了的中农给了适当的批评；对不满土改，让破坏话捣乱社会秩序者，揭露了他的破坏行动；达到了分化，争取，孤立少数坏分子的目的。第三次是公布结束土改结果，让群众自由提出意见，领导上解释、修正，最后通过，正式确定地权，声明今后再不变动，动员全力生产，提出发家致富。总之，开群众大会，必须解决问题。
    为了开好大会，解决问题，支部会、村干会、特别是临时人代会的活动，应该是经常的，解决问题的。制定方案、改定成份、安、补、调剂，发土地证，都应由临时人代会仔细研究，求得大体解决，然后由群众大会修正通过。其中最缠手的是自愿原则下中农抽地、干部退出多分的问题，人代会必须运用座谈会、家庭会、各系统、小组会、以及个别动员、说服解释等方式，正确解决。必须充分运用小型会议解决问题，必须充分发挥临时人代会的权力，否则不是党员干部包办，就是无政府状态的自流混乱下去，使结束土改遭到失败。赞皇领导上自始至终是注意了大会小会的结合运用，尽量求得不浪费群众生产时间，这是工作顺利进展的一个重要原因。
    四、为使结束土改少走弯路，县委领导必须注意三点：
    （１）充分考虑结束土改村的条件。凡支部严重不团结、干部消极、党内外没有积极分子和骨干的村，就不能进行。个别村庄因为没考查好条件是否具备，结果中途停顿。正如区党委所指示，这些村必须先进行初步整党，发现积极分子，有了依靠时，再进行工作。
    （２）各区基点划分多少，要看骨干干部多少而定。骨干应为基点工作组长。干部配备一定要按基点周围村庄多少、好搞难搞、干部强弱而定。原计划各村制定方案，经批准后一齐动手，经验证明不能如此；仍须先从基点入手，稳扎稳打，逐步推进。
    （３）必须建立审查与批准方案的制度，不能把批准认为是个手续。必须认识批准就是为了审查，审查目的就在于正确而稳当的掌握政策。否则必然造成恶果。在开始，区委没有经验时，县委可分头帮助审查批准；在区委掌握了政策，取得了经验之后，即应放手由区委审查批准。否则县委就会陷入事务主义。
