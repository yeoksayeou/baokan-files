Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th: This year, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, thanks to the concerted efforts and hard struggle of the military and civilians throughout the region to overcome natural disasters, has sown 13 million mu of autumn fields, estimated to yield 60-70% of the harvest, laying the foundation for the restoration and development of production in the Border Region. Now that the autumn crops are ripe, there is an urgent need to complete the autumn harvest task with all our strength. The Border Region Masses Daily recently published an editorial calling for "Guaranteeing the Victorious Completion of the Autumn Harvest." The editorial stated: In terms of publicity and education, it is necessary to widely publicize the government's autumn grain collection policy this year, which takes into account both public and private interests and ensures reasonable burdens; publicize the social and land reform policies already determined by the Party Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau in the new, old, and semi-old areas, as well as promote thrift and oppose waste. In terms of organization and leadership, the editorial pointed out: At present, the autumn harvest is the most important central task in rural areas and is the foundation of all work. The primary task of work teams or cadres at all levels after going to the countryside is to fully organize the masses for the autumn harvest. Autumn harvest work should be arranged according to the different conditions of the consolidated areas and the border areas, organizing all labor forces in rural areas to participate. First, the original weeding or wheat planting labor exchange teams should be promptly transformed into autumn harvest labor exchange teams, and the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled should also be organized to participate, so that there is no idle person in the village. Local troops, government offices, and schools must promptly organize manpower and animal power to help the masses, especially to help the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as the masses who lack labor, to carry out the autumn harvest. The editorial also called for attention to the connection between the autumn harvest work and land reform and Party rectification work.

　　陕甘宁群众日报号召
    保证秋收胜利完成
    【新华社西北五日电】陕甘宁边区今年由于全区军民同心协力、艰苦奋斗、战胜灾荒的结果，播种了一千三百万亩秋田，估计可获六、七成收成，奠定恢复与发展边区生产的基础。现秋禾已熟，急待全力完成秋收任务。边区群众日报顷发表社论，号召“保证秋收的胜利完成”，社论称：在宣传教育方面，必须广泛宣传今年政府秋征的公私兼顾、合理负担方针；宣传党中央及西北局已确定了的在新区和老区半老区的社会政策和土改政策，以及宣传节约，反对浪费。在组织领导方面，社论指出：目前秋收是农村中最重要的中心工作，是各项工作的基础。各地工作团或各级干部下乡之后的首要任务就是全力组织群众秋收。根据巩固区与边沿区的不同情况布置秋收工作，组织农村中一切劳动力参加，首先将原有的锄草或种麦变工队及时转为秋收变工队，并要组织老弱病孺参加，做到村中无一闲人。各地驻军、机关、学校均须及时组织人力畜力帮助群众，特别是帮助烈、军、工属及缺乏劳力的群众进行秋收。社论并要求在秋收工作中注意与土地改革和整党工作的联系。
