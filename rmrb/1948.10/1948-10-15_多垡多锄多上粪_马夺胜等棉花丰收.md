(Taiyue Electric) Farmers like Ma Duosheng in Beiliangbi, Jicheng, have achieved a bumper cotton harvest this year, with yields increasing by one to two times compared to last year. In addition to the favorable weather conditions this year, the main reasons are the autumn plowing carried out last year and the increased frequency of weeding this year. According to a survey of six farming households, the land quality is similar (all dry land), but due to differences in autumn plowing, weeding, and fertilization, there are significant differences in harvests. Ma Duosheng's cotton fields were plowed three times, weeded five times, and fertilized with 66 loads of manure, yielding 90 jin per mu. Chen Biangen plowed twice, weeded six times, and fertilized with 15 loads of manure, yielding 75 jin. Ma Chengyu plowed twice, weeded three times, and fertilized with 24 loads of manure, yielding 60 jin. Zhang Jintang plowed twice, weeded five times, and fertilized with 30 loads of manure, yielding 60 jin. Ma Shengming plowed once, weeded eight times, and did not fertilize, yielding 60 jin. Hou Sanfu plowed once, weeded six times, and did not fertilize, yielding 45 jin. From this, we can see the importance of careful farming practices. The masses say, "Scratching the skin in autumn is better than an old ox plowing several times next year," which is very true. Comparing Ma Duosheng and Hou Sanfu, Ma Duosheng plowed his fields in the autumn and then plowed twice again in the spring, applying 60 loads of manure per mu. Hou Sanfu only plowed once at planting time and did not fertilize. Although he weeded more times than Ma Duosheng, his harvest was only half of Ma Duosheng's. The masses also say, "Cotton weeded seven times will yield clusters like garlic," which is also very true. Although Ma Shengming's spring cultivation was poor, he weeded eight times and still yielded 60 jin per mu. Now is the time for autumn plowing, and we must vigorously organize autumn plowing to lay the foundation for a bumper harvest next year.

　　多垡多锄多上粪
    马夺胜等棉花丰收
    【太岳电】冀城北梁壁农民马夺胜等今年棉花丰收，产量比去年提高一倍到二倍。除今年风调雨顺外，主要原因，一个是去年进行了秋垡，一个是今年锄苗次数较多。据六户农民的调查，土地质量差不多（都是旱地），但因秋垡、锄苗、上肥的不同，收成就有很大差别。马夺胜的棉花垡三遍，锄五遍，上粪六十六担，每亩收九十斤。陈便根，垡二遍，锄六遍，上粪十五担，收七十五斤。马成玉垡二遍，锄三遍上粪二十四担，收六十斤。张金堂垡二遍，锄五遍，上粪三十担，收六十斤。马升明垡一遍，锄八遍，没上粪，收六十斤。侯三富垡一遍，锄六遍，没上粪收四十五斤。从这里可以看出做庄稼加工的重要。群众说：“秋天刮破皮，赛过明年老牛犁几犁，”是很正确的。拿马夺胜和侯三富比较，马夺胜经过秋垡，春耕又犁了二遍，每亩上粪六十担；侯三富只种时犁了一遍，没上粪，虽锄的遍数比马夺胜多，但收成只有马夺胜的一半。群众又说：“棉锄七遍，圪＠如蒜连”也很正确。马升明虽春上“作务”差，但锄了八遍，每亩也收了六十斤。现在正是秋垡的时候，必须大力组织秋垡，打下明年丰收的基础。
