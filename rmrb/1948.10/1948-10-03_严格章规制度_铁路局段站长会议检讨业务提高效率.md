Strict Rules and Regulations
Railway Bureau Section Chiefs' Meeting Reviews Operations to Improve Efficiency

[Shijiazhuang News] The Railway Bureau held its first meeting of transportation section chiefs and station masters (over a hundred people) from the end of last month to the 7th of this month since the commencement of traffic operations. The meeting comprehensively reviewed the situation in the seven months since the start of transport operations on February 5th. It also discussed and formulated various regulations in detail, aiming to realize the general policy of "increasing transport volume and facilitating merchants." On the first day of the meeting, Director Li of the Transportation Department summarized the work of this stage, believing that considerable achievements had been made. During the forty-five days of the rush transport period in February, March, April, May, and June and July, a total of X ten thousand tons of industrial and commercial goods from public enterprises and general private merchants were transported. X ten thousand passengers were transported. This played a significant role in material exchange in the North China Liberated Area, promoting economic prosperity, developing industry and commerce, and improving people's lives. The military transport mission was successfully completed in X month, providing strong support to the front lines. He pointed out that these achievements were not easy to come by. Staff at all stations established and persisted in their work under extremely difficult conditions. Without station buildings, they used iron boxcars as station buildings, cooking and sleeping in them, enduring wind and rain. Eleven stations still have no buildings.

The conference held six consecutive days of group discussions, conducting criticism and self-criticism, and reviewed the shortcomings in past work, such as a poor attitude towards merchants in the past, failing to provide convenience, not patiently answering questions from customers, customers' bicycles not arriving when they did, not providing wagons for transporting whole wagonloads of food for seven or eight days, loaded wagons not moving for four or five days, and security guards conducting too many inspections. The meeting decided that all procedures should be simplified as much as possible in the future. Each station should add blackboards and publish important regulations in towns. Station names should be announced during train journeys to allow passengers to prepare to disembark.

In terms of business management, the main inconveniences for merchants in the past were self-managed less-than-carload (LCL) shipments and loading and unloading issues. For example, poor wagon allocation, some LCL cargo not being loaded for several days midway, some stations not handling freight, and cargo only being ticketed as parcels (which are more expensive than LCL), but then mixed with LCL cargo, causing customer dissatisfaction. There were also many instances of disorganized loading. In the future, in order to greatly facilitate small and medium-sized merchants, each train will have two LCL cars instead of one to increase capacity and overcome the phenomena of disorder and lack of management. Temporary measures have been provisionally stipulated for loading and unloading. Each station should contact the local government, trade unions, and other organizations to discuss methods, determine appropriate fees, and the loading and unloading teams will be under the command of the station. Customers will be allowed to load and unload their own goods, and station staff will not be allowed to do loading and unloading work. If customers are too busy and afraid of delaying the train schedule, they can be helped, but high prices are not allowed. More appropriate methods will be considered in the future. In order to strictly manage business operations, various inspections will be conducted at any time in the future to solve difficulties and prevent fraud in a timely manner.

Strict operational discipline to reduce accidents is the central key to increasing transport volume and facilitating merchants. There were serious shortcomings in the past, such as trains often not arriving on time, dozens of accidents of various kinds occurring in seven months, dispatch telephones being misused for idle chatter, and insufficient communication between train personnel and the station. Although the equipment is not perfect and there are many difficulties, insufficient attention from personnel is a very important reason; for example, no accidents occurred during military transport, but now accidents are increasing. In the future, regulations will prohibit the misuse of dispatch telephones, and salary deductions will be imposed if misuse is discovered. Each station will report vehicle conditions on time, train personnel will maintain close contact with the station and be under the command of the station master, and all personnel will be trained to improve their skills. Careful planning, thorough execution, and close contact are important keys to operational work. Efforts must be made to achieve the three principles of "safety, accuracy, and speed" in train operation.

In order to improve work efficiency, the conference held two detailed discussions on the issue of station personnel staffing and division of labor. Many stations voluntarily streamlined their staffing. A preliminary discussion plan for a total of thirty-seven stations called for a reduction of forty-eight people compared to the current number of employees, while still ensuring that the work is done better. During the discussion, some experienced people who have worked in the railway for many years were invited to talk about the historical personnel configuration and business conditions. The discussion concluded that strict implementation of regulations is a fundamental issue. Therefore, many methods were proposed for station staff codes of conduct, reward and punishment measures, and inspection reporting systems. Examination systems will be conducted regularly in the future, and rewards and punishments must be clear and efficiency must be improved.

　　严格章规制度
    铁路局段站长会议检讨业务提高效率
    【石家庄讯】路局上月底至本月七日，召开通车营业以来第一次的运输段长和站长百余人的会议，把从二月五日开始运输营业至今七个月来的情况做了全面检讨，并详细讨论制定各种规章，以求实现“提高运量、便利客商”的总方针。会议第一天，运输处李处长总结此阶段工作，认为有不小成绩。在二、三、四、五月份和六、七月份四十五天的抢运期间，共计运输公营企业和一般私营客商的工商货物×万余吨。运输旅客×万余人。对华北解放区物资交流、繁荣经济、发展工商业、改善人民生活起了很大作用。×月份顺利完成军运任务，有力地支援了前线。他指出：这些成绩的得来是不容易的。各站人员在极端艰苦的情况下建立和坚持工作，没有站房，就以铁闷车皮作站房，做饭睡觉，受尽风吹雨洒，至今还有十一个站没有房子。
    大会连续进行了六天的分组讨论，开展批评与自我批评，检讨了以往工作中的缺点，如过去对客商态度不好，不予方便，客人提的问题，不耐心解答，客人运了自行车，人到了，车子没到，托运整车食粮，七、八天不给车，装好的车四、五天走不了，警卫队员检查太多等。会议决定今后一切手续力求简便。各站加黑板和在城镇公布重要章则。行车时报站名，客人好准备下车等。
    在营业管理上，以往给客商不方便的，主要是自理零担（即不满整车的货物）和装卸问题，如配车不好，中途有些零担货，几天装不上，有的站不办货运，货物只得按包裹起票（较零担价高），但又与零担混装，客人不满，装载零乱的现象也很多。今后为大力方便中、小客商，每列车由一辆零担车增为两辆，以便多装，克服零乱无人管的现象。装卸方面暂规定临时办法，各站与当地政府、工会等联系，合商办法，定出适当费用，装卸队受车站指挥，并允许客人自己装卸，站上人员不许做装卸工作，如遇客人太忙怕装慢误车点时，可以帮助，但亦不许要高价，将来再考虑更妥善办法。为严格营业管理，今后并将随时进行各种检查，以及时解决困难防止舞弊。
    严密运转减少事故，是提高运量便利客商的中心关键。过去有严重缺点，如列车常不能按时到达，七个月共发生各种事故数十次，调度电话乱用说闲话，行车人员与站上联系不够等。虽然设备不完善，有很多困难，但人员注意力不够是很重要原因；如军运期间一次事故也没发生，现在事故却越来越多。今后规定调度电话不准乱用，查出罚薪，各站准时报告车辆情形，行车人员与站上密切联系，并受站长指挥，并训练所有人员提高技术。计划的周密，执行的彻底，联系的密切是运转工作中的重要关键，要努力做到行车中的“安全、准确、迅速”三原则。
    为提高工作效率，大会对站上人员编制分工问题作了两次详尽讨论，有许多站自动精减编制，共计三十七个站初步讨论计划较现在实有人数减四十八人，还要保证把工作做得更好。讨论中，并请一些在铁路服务多年的有经验人述说历史上的人员配置和业务情况。讨论中认为：严格执行规章是根本问题，故对站员守则、奖惩办法、检查报告制度等提出很多办法。今后并定期进行考试制度，要赏罚严明提高效率。
