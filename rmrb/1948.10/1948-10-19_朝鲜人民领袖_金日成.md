　　Korean People's Leader
  　Kim Il-sung
    Kim Il-sung, who is praised and loved by the Korean people, is thirty-four years old this year. He is the leader of the anti-Japanese guerrilla army that grew from thirty to ten thousand people, a hero in well-known folk tales, one of the leaders of the Korean Workers' Party (the name after the merger of the Korean Communist Party and the New People's Party), former chairman of the North Korean Provisional People's Committee, and was recently appointed as Prime Minister and ordered to organize the cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    In 1912, Kim Il-sung was born in Man'gingu Village, the third year of the Japanese occupation of Korea. His father was a rural teacher and revolutionary. He was arrested for establishing an underground organization in Pyongyang. After being released from prison, he fled to Manchuria, but soon returned to Korea, participated in the March Uprising, and was arrested again. He died of illness after his release. Before his death, Kim Il-sung's mother took out the two "Klee" pistols that his father had buried and handed them to the fourteen-year-old Kim Il-sung. The father's last weapons became the son's first weapons.
    After the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, Kim Il-sung was the secretary of the East Manchurian Communist Youth League. He and thirty brothers organized the first Korean guerrilla team. At that time, he was not yet twenty years old.
    After arduous battles, Kim Il-sung's guerrilla team grew stronger, seized Japanese weapons to arm themselves, and thousands upon thousands of people poured into the guerrilla team.
    In 1934, under the leadership of Kim Il-sung, several guerrilla teams formed the first guerrilla division and fought against the Japanese invaders together with the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army of China. The Japanese invaders once offered a reward of 200,000 yuan to "capture" Kim Il-sung and spread rumors that Kim Il-sung had been captured and executed, but the Japanese had "buried" Kim Il-sung several times, and Kim Il-sung was resurrected several times. The reward for capturing Kim Il-sung increased day by day, but all in vain. Therefore, it is not surprising that the legend of Kim Il-sung, who cannot be killed, is circulating among the people; because he is supported and supported by the people.
    On August 15, 1945, the Soviet Red Army liberated North Korea. Kim Il-sung was elected chairman of the People's Committee by the people. Under his leadership, land reform and various democratic reforms were implemented, and ten million people in North Korea lived a happy life.

### 朝鲜人民领袖　金日成

　　朝鲜人民领袖
  　金日成
    为朝鲜人民所歌颂、爱戴的金日成，今年三十四岁，是由三十个人发展到十万人的抗日游击大军的领袖，妇孺皆知的民间故事中的英雄，朝鲜劳动党（朝鲜共产党与新民党合并后的名称）的领袖之一，曾任北鲜临时人民委员会主席，最近被任命为总理，奉命组织朝鲜人民民主共和国内阁。
    一九一二年，金日成生于满今九村，正是朝鲜被日寇占领的第三年。他父亲是乡村教师和革命者，因在平壤建立地下组织被捕，出狱后逃亡到满洲，但不久又回到朝鲜，参加三月暴动再度被捕，释放后因病逝世。金日成的母亲在临死前，把他父亲埋藏起来的两支“克利”手枪拿出来，交给十四岁的金日成。父亲最后的武器成了儿子最初的武器。
    日寇占领满洲后，金日成是东满共产主义青年团的书记。他和三十个弟兄，组织起第一支朝鲜游击队，那时，他还不到二十岁。
    经过坚苦的战斗后，金日成的游击队壮大了，缴获了日寇的武器武装自己，成千成百的人民涌入游击队。
    一九三四年，几支游击队在金日成的领导下，编成了第一个游击师团和中国东北人民革命军一起对日寇作战。日寇曾悬赏廿万元“捉拿”金日成，并造谣说金日成被俘，已经枪决，但是日本人“埋葬”过几次金日成，金日成就复活过几次，捉拿金日成的悬赏就一天天增多，结果都是白费。所以老百姓中间流传着打不死金日成的传说，是不足奇怪的；因为他是受着人民的拥护和支持的。
    一九四五年八月十五日，苏联红军解放了北鲜，金日成被人民选为人民委员会主席，在他的领导下，实行了土地改革及各种民主改革，北鲜一千万人民过着幸福的生活。
