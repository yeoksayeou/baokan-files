Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: The Northeast Administrative Committee's Industry Department's first coal mine conference, lasting ten days, concluded on September 15th. Except for the Fushun and four other mining areas, all other coal mines in the Northeast have been liberated and are gradually resuming production. However, in the past, state-owned coal mines in the Northeast, due to initial takeover, were geographically dispersed, resulting in great independence. Each operated independently without scientific division of labor and unified leadership based on complex production conditions. In terms of business management, attention was only paid to simple administration and labor movements, neglecting technology and business. Leadership relied not on systems but on individual personnel's manual labor methods. These adverse phenomena have greatly hindered the further development of production. Therefore, the basic spirit of this conference is to strengthen enterprise management, first by establishing organizational structures, defining powers and responsibilities, and assigning responsibility at different levels. The conference made five resolutions: to improve organizational structures, stipulate worker treatment, strengthen security work, unify material distribution, and improve the accounting system.

　　(1) Organizational Structure: It was decided to establish a Secretariat, Planning Office, Materials Department, and Management Department within the First Division of the Industry Department. The First Division directly governs the Mining Bureau. Each bureau can establish a Secretariat and seven sections (Mining, Management, Materials, Mechanical and Electrical, Engineering, General Affairs, and Transportation) based on the specific conditions of each mining area. Under each Mining Bureau, several mines can be established based on the distribution and development of pit entrances. Each mine establishes an office with four sections: General Affairs, Mining Affairs, Electrical Engineering, and Management. Below the mine is the pit, which is the basic organizational unit of production. Each level of organization should formulate organizational rules, divide powers and responsibilities, and act in accordance with the rules. A meeting system should be established at each level, and work reports should be submitted to the higher level regularly.

　　(2) Worker Treatment: In order to break the shortcomings of "taking care of the population" and egalitarianism in wages, the principle of progressive wage levels was implemented. Technical workers were divided into three grades and nine levels, management staff into four grades, and technical staff into five grades. Wages are converted based on the price of goods on the 15th and 25th of each month and paid in kind as much as possible. Working hours are stipulated as eight hours per day to take care of workers' health. Personnel in the pits are required to work a minimum of twenty-five shifts per month. Those who work more than twenty-five shifts will be awarded one additional shift for each additional shift worked. Personnel above ground will be awarded one shift for every twenty-eight shifts worked. Public holidays are uniformly stipulated as the 1st and 16th of each month. Workers are provided with free housing, electricity, running water, and bathing.

　　(3) Security Work: It was determined that: 1. In terms of the security system, each Mining Bureau, mine, and pit shall establish security sections, divisions, and groups, formulate various security regulations, establish a regular reporting and statistical system, and set up a "Security Bonus" to encourage security personnel with special contributions. 2. In terms of ideological education, security personnel should regularly discuss the causes and prevention methods of various accidents, compile security teaching materials, and organize administrative cadres and workers to study. 3. In terms of technology and equipment, in areas with thick coal seams, the main focus is to change coal mining methods, pay attention to dense drilling work, and set up security warehouses; in addition, improvement methods are also stipulated for various crossings, ventilation equipment, and security instruments.

　　(4) Material Issues: It is stipulated that unified procurement and unified distribution shall be implemented, and efforts should be made to manufacture equipment independently. Small factories attached to each Mining Bureau that manufacture various equipment are uniformly managed and distributed by the First Division. The conference stipulated that the Mining Bureau shall list all materials in the warehouse by the end of October. The material warehouse shall be inventoried once a year.

　　(5) Accounting System Issues: In the future, attention should be paid to issues such as inventory and valuation, budgeting and final accounting.

　　东北召开首届煤矿会议
    健全机构确立制度
    规定合理工资加强保安工作
    【新华社东北六日电】历时十天的东北行政委员会工业部第一届煤矿会议，已于九月十五日结束。东北各地煤矿除抚顺等五矿区外，其余均经解放，逐渐恢复生产。但过去东北各国营煤矿因接收伊始，地区分散，故独立性很大，各自为政，没有根据复杂的生产情况，实行科学的分工与统一领导，经营管理方面只注意单纯行政与工运，忽视技术与业务，不靠制度，只靠个别人员的手工业工作方式进行领导。这种不良现象已大大妨碍生产的进一步发展。故本届会议的基本精神为加强企业化，首先是建立组织机构、规定职权，分层负责。会议作出健全组织机构、规定工人待遇、加强保安工作、统一材料分配、健全会计制度等五项决议。
    （一）组织机构：决定于工业部第一处内成立秘书室、计划室、材料部、经理部四个部门，第一处直辖矿务局；各局内可根据各矿区具体情况设立秘书室及矿务、经理、材料、机电、工务、总务、运输等七科；各矿务局下，以坑口分布与发展情况，得分若干矿，各矿设办事处，下设总务、矿务、工电、经理四股，矿以下为坑，坑为生产的基本组织单位。各级组织应制订组织章程，分掌职权，照章办事；并确定各级会议制度，定期向上级作工作报告。
    （二）工人待遇：为打破在工资上的“照顾人口”和平均主义的缺点，实行工资交叉等级累进的原则，确定技术工人分三等九级，管理职员分四等，技术职员分五等。工资以每月十五日及二十五日物价折算，尽量以实物支付。劳动时间每日规定为八小时，以照顾工人健康。坑内人员每月以上满二十五个班为准，上满二十五个班以上者每多一班即奖一个班，坑上人员上满二十八个班奖一个班。公休日统一规定为每月一日与十六日。工人住房、电灯、自来水、洗澡等均免费供给。
    （三）保安工作：确定：一、保安制度方面，各矿务局、各矿、各坑下设保安科、股、组，制订各种保安规程建立定期汇报与统计制度，设“保安奖金”鼓励有特殊贡献的保安人员。二、思想教育方面，保安人员应定期讨论各种事故的原因与防止办法，编制保安教材，并组织行政干部及工人进行学习。三、技术及设备方面，在厚煤层的地区，主要是改变采煤方法，注意密钻工作，设置保安仓库；此外对各种道口、通风设备以及保安仪器，亦规定改进办法。
    （四）材料问题：规定实行统一采购，统一分配，并尽量争取自造器材。各矿务局附设之制造各种器材的小型工厂，由第一处统一管理与分配。会议规定和矿务局于十月底将仓库内所有材料开列清单。材料仓库每年盘存一次。
    （五）会计制度问题：今后应注意盘存与作价、预算和决算等问题。
