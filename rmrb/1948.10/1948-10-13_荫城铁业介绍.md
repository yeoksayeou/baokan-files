Introduction to Yincheng Iron Industry

　　Yincheng Town belongs to Changzhi County, Shanxi Province. Historically, this county has been a distribution center for the iron industry in southeastern Shanxi. Its products have been sold as far as nineteen provinces, including Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi, giving it the reputation of "Thousands of Li to Pengcheng, Ten Thousands of Li to Yincheng." The iron ore area is centered on Yincheng. Before the war, approximately 14,000 people in Changzhi were involved in iron production. Together with Huguan, the total reached over 20,000. The iron industry became an important source of income for the local population. The annual income from the mining area accounted for more than 60% of the total income of the masses. According to statistics, there were 5,000 furnaces (including square furnaces, strip furnaces, cooking furnaces, and finishing furnaces) in ten counties of southeastern Shanxi, including Changzhi, Huguan, Gaoping, and Lingchuan (with 1,879 furnaces and 13,039 workers near Yincheng alone). Each furnace could support an average of 80 people, supporting a total of 400,000 people, accounting for 5% of the total population of southeastern Shanxi. Therefore, the local people had the saying "eight parts iron industry, two parts autumn harvest." The period from 1924 to before the Zhili-Fengtian War was the most prosperous period for the iron industry. Merchants from all over came to Yincheng to purchase goods in large quantities, and the products could not meet the demand. The reasons for the prosperity of the iron industry at that time were: (1) Abundant capital and concentrated capital; most factory owners were landlords and capitalists, and many also had charcoal kilns to provide fuel. (2) Abundant labor force, and capitalists could absorb it at low prices. (3) No war interrupted transportation, which was relatively convenient. Goods sold well, and capitalists could profit. There was a saying that they "earned a bucket of gold a day." (4) Prices were stable, and merchants paid in advance to order goods. Later, due to the import of foreign locks and nails into the mainland, the local iron products suffered their first blow. After the enemy occupied the area, the iron industry was destroyed, and the war hindered transportation. Merchants from other places almost disappeared, and local merchants dared not go out, and the iron industry was almost completely destroyed. According to statistics in 1944, there were only 83 furnaces and 323 workers. In the early days of liberation, most of the iron furnaces were operated as partnerships or joint ventures between labor and capital, and they were not operated regularly. The output and quality were far inferior to those before the war. Later, with the government's loan support, the number of iron furnaces increased sharply for a time. In the spring of 1946, the number of iron industry furnaces centered on Yincheng increased to 565, and the number of workers reached 4,687. After 1946, the transportation routes were smooth, and iron products were sold throughout Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. After the start of the War of Self-Defense, due to inconvenient transportation, lack of labor (participation in the army and war), villages were unwilling to let workers go out, and even if they did, the wages were high; in addition, rural struggles, dispersed capital, and unstable prices, the pre-order situation disappeared, and the phenomenon of goods looking for the market gradually changed from the past market finding goods. Therefore, by last December, it had dropped to 341 iron furnaces and 1,938 workers. (According to a survey in the first half of last year, the daily transaction volume of iron goods in the market was 5-6 million yuan. Among the 221 commercial and trading firms in the town, which are centered on iron goods, there are 27 iron goods firms with a capital of 60 million yuan, accounting for nearly 70% of the total capital of the town.) The characteristics of the iron industry in this area are semi-agricultural and semi-commercial. Production is seasonal. The iron industry is engaged in during the slack farming season, and work is suspended during the busy farming season. Furthermore, the division of labor is strict among workers. Each specializes in one line and passes it on to one line. The technology is conservative and not easily taught. The current problems are: first, supplying the square furnace (the source of all iron goods) with sufficient raw materials, especially solving the problem of sufficient coal supply. The capitalists have proposed restoring the pre-war combination of coal mines and iron furnaces. Second, due to conservative technology, workers are quite lacking. Currently, there are only 14 square furnace workers, 12 strip furnace workers, and even fewer stir-fry furnace workers in the Fourth District of Changzhi (Yincheng District). There are a total of 14 in the three counties of Changzhi, Gaoping, and Lingchuan, and they are all over 40 years old. Although apprenticeship and education were promoted once last December, the technology has not been improved. Third, the sales problem. Currently, iron goods are only sold in the Liberated Areas, and the purchasing power of the masses is not high. At present, it is not overproduction, but the finished products are expensive and cannot be transported out. Ironware stations are now being established on a village basis, and the Taihang Trading Company will also purchase some finished products when necessary. Fourth, the iron industry production is seasonal, and a large amount of production is needed during normal times. However, capital is generally lacking, and turnover is difficult. Government loans can help solve some of the problems, but not the basic problems. Therefore, it is necessary to combine labor and capital, and workers can buy shares.

　　荫城铁业介绍
    荫城镇属山西省长治县，该县历史上即为晋东南各县铁业集散地，行销远达晋、冀、鲁、豫、陕等十九省，素有“千里彭城，万里荫城”之说。铁矿区以荫城为中心。战前参加铁业生产者长治约一万四千人，连壶关共为两万余人，铁业成为附近群众重要生产之一。矿区每年收入占群众总收入百分之六十以上。据统计晋东南长治、壶关、高平、陵川等十县，共有方炉条炉炊炉成货炉等五千个（仅荫城附近即有炉一八七九个，工人一三零三九名），每座炉平均可养八十人，共可养四十万人，占晋东南总人口的百分之五。因之附近群众有“八分铁业二分秋”的谚语。民国十三年到直奉战前，为铁业最盛时期，各地客商大批到荫城办货，出品供不应求。当时铁业兴盛的原因：（一）资金雄厚资本集中，厂主大部是地主兼资本家，且多有必须燃料的炭窑。（二）劳动力多资方可贱价吸收。（三）没战争阻隔交通比较便利，货物畅销，资方有利可图。曾有“日进斗金”之称。（四）物价稳定，商贩预先交钱订货。后因洋锁洋钉输进内地，该地铁货初次遭受打击；敌占后因对铁业摧毁，加以战争阻碍，交通不便，外地客商几形绝迹，当地商贩不敢外出，铁业被毁殆尽。据一九四四年统计：仅有炉八三座，工人三二三个。解放初期铁炉多为合伙经营及劳资合营，且不经常营业，产量质量大不如战前。后经政府贷款扶植，铁炉一度激增。一九四六年春，以荫城为中心的铁业炉，增至五六五座，工人则达四六八七名。一九四六年后运路畅通，铁货遍销晋冀鲁豫各地。自卫战争开始后，由于交通不便，劳力缺乏（参军参战等），村里不愿工人外出，即外出工资亦高；加以农村斗争，资金分散物价不稳，预订情况绝迹，渐变过去市场找货现象为货找市场，因之到去冬十二月，降至三四一座铁炉，一九三八个工人。（据去年前半年调查，市上每天铁货交易额为五、六百万元，以铁货为中心的全镇二二一座行商座商中，有二七家铁货行，资金六千万元，占全镇总资金百分之七十弱。）该地铁业上的特点为半农半商，生产带有季节性，农闲从事铁业生产，农忙停工务农。再者工人分工严格，各专一行，各传一行，技术保守不轻易传授。当前存在的问题一是供给方炉（一切铁货的源泉）充足的原料，特别是解决煤炭的足够供应问题，资方提出了恢复战前煤窑与铁炉结合经营办法。二是由于技术保守，工人颇感缺乏，现长治四区（荫城区）只有方炉工人十四名，条炉工人十二名，炒炉工人更少，长、高、陵三县，共十四个，且都是年在四十岁以上者。去冬十二月虽曾提倡尊师爱徒训练教育一次，但技术亦未提高。三是销路问题。现铁货仅销解放区，且群众购买力不大，目前不是生产过剩，而是成品高贵货运不出。现正以村为单位成立铁业货栈，必要时太行贸易公司亦将收买一部成品。四是铁业生产有季节性，平时需大批生产，然资金普遍缺乏，周转不开，政府货贷可帮助解决一部，不能解决基本问题，故需劳资结合工人入股。　　　　　　　　　　（太行电）
