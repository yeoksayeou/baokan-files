Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Last month, the Tianjin Dagongbao published a declaration by sixteen reactionary professors including Fan Jichang, Zhu Guangqian, and Hu Xian, entitled "China's Way Out." This declaration indicates that the reactionary faction of China's big bourgeoisie is actively selling out the country to pursue further armed intervention in China by US imperialism. These sixteen reactionary professors, who once feigned a certain liberal facade, have demonstrated in this declaration their resolute support for the Chiang Kai-shek group and the imperialist camp. This small group of American reactionary parrots said: "At present, the democratic systems of the whole world are being threatened by totalitarian communism (?). Therefore, in foreign affairs, we advocate uniting with countries that love freedom and democracy (?) to jointly resist totalitarian aggression (?), as in the Second World War. In domestic affairs, although we are not satisfied with the current politics, we cannot deny that the direction in which the authorities are working is correct." Like other reactionaries, they also pin their despicable dreams on foreign aid and the Third World War they advocate. They said: "In this tense and confrontational international situation, a major war may break out at any time... Without delay, we openly and frankly advocate establishing close military ties with Western democratic countries, and in particular, leveraging their technology and equipment." Although Hu Shih's name is not on the declaration, people believe that this declaration represents Hu Shih's position, and many of the signatories to the declaration are well-known Hu Shih followers. Observers believe that this declaration actually has only two effects: first, to let people know that the Hu Shih group has become even more wholeheartedly loyal to the most reactionary elements at home and abroad than before. Second, to let people know that there are so few people willing to sign this reactionary document. This is in stark contrast to the fact that hundreds of professors in Beiping have signed previous declarations truly opposing foreign aggression and supporting democracy.

　　胡适派反动教授真形更暴露发表无耻宣言吹弹战贩滥调
    【新华社陕北十五日电】上月十日天津大公报登载樊际昌、朱光潜、胡先等十六个反动教授题为“中国的出路”宣言，该宣言表示中国大资产阶级的反动派别正在积极出卖祖国，以追求美帝国主义对于中国的进一步武装干涉。曾经伪装某种自由主义面貌的十六个反动教授，在这个宣言里表明了他们拥护蒋介石集团和帝国主义阵营的坚决立场。这一小群美国反动派的学舌者说：“现在全世界的民主制度都在受着极权共产主义（？）的威胁。所以，对外我们主张联合爱好自由民主（？）的国家共同对抗极权的侵略（？），一如在二次大战期间。对内虽然我们对当前的政治不满意，但我们不能否认当局所努力的方向是对的。”跟旁的反动分子一样，他们并把自己的卑鄙梦想寄托于外国援助和他们所鼓吹的第三次世界大战上面。他们说：“在这紧张对立的国际情势下，大战随时有爆发的可能。……时不及待，我们公开坦白的主张，应与西方民主国家成立紧密的军事联系，尤应借重他们的技术与设备。”虽然宣言上没有胡适的名字，人们都相信这个宣言代表着胡适的立场，宣言的署名者不少是出名的胡适派。观察家认为这个宣言实际上只有两个作用：第一是让人们知道，胡适集团已经比以前更加死心塌地为国内外最反动的分子效忠。第二是让人们知道，愿意在这个反动文件上签名的人是这样的少。这与北平旁的教授们历次所发表的真正反对外国侵略与拥护民主的宣言有成百人签名一事，是一个鲜明的对照。
