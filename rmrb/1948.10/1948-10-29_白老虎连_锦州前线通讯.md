　　"White Tiger Company"
  　Frontline Dispatch from Jinzhou
    White Tiger Village is a high ground five miles north of Jinzhou city. The battle of White Tiger Village was an unusually fierce battle in the outer defenses during the liberation of Jinzhou. Thirty-seven brave warriors from a certain company of a certain unit, with resolute, tenacious, and heroic fighting, defended the White Tiger Village position, resisted more than a regiment of the enemy, successfully completed their mission, and were honored with the title of "White Tiger Company."
    On the 25th of last month, a company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was ordered to occupy two hilltops about 100 meters apart in White Tiger Village to monitor the enemy harassing from Jinzhou. At dawn on the 26th, the enemy counterattacked with two regiments of troops, vying for the high ground, and launched a fierce attack on the mountain under the cover of artillery and aircraft. The heroic fighters calmly defended the hilltops, repelling every enemy assault. Piles of enemy corpses rolled down the mountain. After suffering five or six disastrous defeats in attacking the mountain, the enemy, under the cover of five tanks, threw in all their forces, wedging into the highway between the two hills, surrounding the two hilltops separately. The bandits arrogantly shouted "Hand over your guns!" and pounced on the mountain road. The warriors calmly met them with fierce machine-gun fire and hand grenades, killing or wounding more than a company of the enemy.
    On the hilltop where Company Commander Chen Xueliang and Political Instructor You Guangwen were located, there were a total of thirty-seven combatants and support personnel. The enemy was attacking fiercely with more than a regiment of troops. After dusk, they reorganized their combat and gradually withdrew into a small courtyard at the foot of the mountain to defend it. The frenzied enemy surrounded the small courtyard even more tightly, with artillery and machine guns bombarding the houses, and enemy tanks rushing to the courtyard walls. The situation became even more critical.
    At this time, the political instructor first burned all the documents and tore the recently received allowance into shreds; the company commander smashed his beloved watch; the small gunner, because he had no more shells, also disassembled the parts; the bugler smashed his bugle. Everyone was determined to fight to the last bullet and not let the enemy take anything. The response to the enemy's shameless shouting was the warriors' ironclad oath: "You are shameless for working for Chiang Kai-shek! We will never surrender our guns even if we die, and the last grenade will explode!"
    The fierce battle continued, the house was about to collapse, dust was flying, and it was almost impossible to open one's eyes. But the warriors' courage became higher and higher, and when the gun barrels became hot, they poured urine on them. While fighting, the warriors sang the magnificent war song of the People's Liberation Army.
    The fierce battle continued for more than twenty hours. In the face of the warriors' fearless spirit, the enemy was helpless and dared not rush in disorder. In the evening, the thirty-seven warriors, having accomplished their mission, were ordered to transfer and successfully broke through the encirclement.

　　“白老虎连”
  　锦州前线通讯
    白老虎屯是锦州城北五里的高地。白老虎屯战斗是这次解放锦州之役外围战中的一个异常激烈的战斗。某部某连三十七勇士以坚决顽强英勇的战斗，坚持白老虎屯阵地，抗击一个多团的敌人，胜利地完成了任务，荣获“白老虎连”的称号。
    上月二十五日，解放军某部一连奉命占领了白老虎屯两个相距约一百公尺的山头，监视由锦州出扰的敌人。二十六日拂晓，敌人以两个团的兵力反扑过来，争夺高地，在大炮、飞机掩护下向山上猛攻。英勇战士们沉着地据守山头，把敌人的每一次冲锋都打得落花流水。敌尸一堆堆地滚下山去。敌人在五、六次攻山惨败后，就在五辆坦克掩护下，投入全部兵力，楔入了两山之间的公路，把两个山头分别包围起来了。匪徒们狂妄地叫着“交枪啊！”向山路猛扑。勇士们沉着地以炽烈的机枪火力和手榴弹迎击着，先后杀伤敌人一连以上。
    在连长陈学良和指导员由广文所在的山头上，全部战斗员和勤杂人员共三十七人。敌人以一团多的兵力猛攻着。黄昏后，他们重新组织了一下战斗，逐步撤入了山下的一个小院落内坚守。疯狂的敌人把小院落包围得更紧了，炮火机枪轰击着房子，敌人的坦克也冲到了院墙。情况更加紧急了。
    在这时候，指导员首先烧毁了一切文件，把才领的津贴费也撕成粉碎；连长把他的心爱的手表捣毁了；小炮手因没有了炮弹也把零件卸了；司号员砸破了自己的军号。大家决心打完最后一颗子弹，不让敌人拿去一点东西。回答敌人无耻的喊话的，是勇士们钢铁般的誓词：“你们为蒋介石卖命真无耻！我们死也不会交枪，最后一颗手榴弹也要开花！”
    激烈的战斗继续着，房子打得快垮，尘土飞扬，几乎连眼睛也睁不开。但勇士们的勇气越来越高，枪筒打热了他们就用尿浇。勇士们一面打着，一面高唱雄壮的人民解放军的战歌。
    恶战继续了二十多个钟头。在勇士们的大无畏精神前面，敌人无可奈何，不敢乱冲。晚上，三十七勇士以任务达成，奉命转移，胜利地突出了重围。
