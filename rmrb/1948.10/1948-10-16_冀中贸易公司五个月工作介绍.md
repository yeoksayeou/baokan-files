Introduction to the Five-Month Work of the Jizhong Trading Company

　　The Jizhong Trading Company (formerly renamed Demao Company) was established in February 1946. It has 42 branches and sub-branches, almost covering all major towns in Jizhong, and is closely related to the economic life of the industrial and commercial circles and the vast people of Jizhong. Now, a brief introduction to the main work from January to May of this year is as follows.

　　The environment in which the work was carried out this year:

　　(1) The liberated areas are connected into one piece, the environment is relatively stable, and transportation is developed, which provides a better environment for trade work. (2) Last year's harvest was not strong. After the leveling, although poor peasants and farm laborers obtained some windfall wealth, they consumed a lot last winter, and they still need to purchase some grain this spring. In the southwestern part of Jizhong, the autumn drought was severe. Later, because the leveling started last winter, the number of merchants and peddlers suddenly decreased sharply, and the materials in various places failed to achieve the due natural adjustment, which deepened the degree of food shortage in the disaster areas. (3) Our northern region is affected by the prices in the enemy-occupied areas, and grain is smuggled out. Although the Bohai Sea to the east is a prosperous area, grain has not been able to flow into our area in large quantities through natural adjustment by the masses due to the inconsistent currency. The southern neighbor, Ji'nan, can still import some grain, but in the past, due to the inconsistent currency, and later because the legal ratio (one to ten) has a certain distance from the natural ratio (around one to nine), the grain has not been able to flow smoothly into our area. The western neighbor, Jixi, especially the Zhengtai line, is seriously short of grain, and grain flows westward to Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Jin-Sui, which must be supplied by our area in large quantities, which further increases the burden of supplying food grain to our area. (4) With the development of the great production movement after the leveling, a large number of agricultural loans and industrial investments, and a considerable amount of currency was issued, latent basic factors for price increases were hidden. (5) After the leveling began last year, prices once plummeted, and currency became a means of storage in the hands of the masses, which increased the price fluctuations this spring.

　　Main work in the past five months:

　　(1) This spring, under our control, except for a period of fluctuation in May, prices have basically maintained a steady rise. That is, when the price situation suddenly changed in May, under our vigorous organization of transportation to support friendly areas (12.4 million catties of grain were transferred to Shijiazhuang and 15 million catties to the North Yue area), and vigorously supplying the needs of the market (58.82 million catties of coarse grain and 30.96 million catties of wheat were sold in March, April, and May alone), the sudden surge in prices returned to stability. This is mainly reflected in:

　　1. At the end of the year, the masses scrambled to buy grain (especially wheat) to prepare for the New Year. If our stores had not supplied a large amount of grain at that time, a surge would have inevitably formed. When the market opened after the New Year, there was very little grain on the market, and a scramble to buy grain also formed. Relying on the sufficient supply of state-owned stores, prices remained stable. According to statistics at the time, the amount of grain sold by our store in Hejian accounted for 13 times the amount of grain sold by the masses on the market, 3 times in Wurenqiao, and 3 times in Duancun. The store has established close ties with the vast masses and its prestige has been greatly improved.

　　2. In April, the enemy once invaded the hinterland of Jizhong in Hejian. Under our emergency measures to insist on selling materials during the war to support currency and stabilize prices, prices did not change at all.

　　3. In mid-April, the currencies of the two regions were unified, which was a major change in economic activities. However, because the legal ratio was about 10% different from the natural ratio, the grain from Ji'nan suddenly decreased, and even caused the grain to flow backward. If our state-owned stores and Ji'nan state-owned stores had not vigorously cooperated in selling grain, a period of fluctuation would have inevitably occurred.

　　In addition to the price fluctuation in May, the entire region has basically maintained reasonable differences between regions and commodities, maintained the normal flow of materials, and effectively supported the disaster areas, industrial areas, and mountainous areas to tide over the spring famine. We have guaranteed appropriate profits for all transporters. The transportation industry has greatly developed this spring. The incomplete statistics of the stores under the Jizhong Company system alone show that transportation costs of more than 14 billion yuan have been spent. It also enabled legitimate merchants, especially peddlers, to obtain profits. A merchant in Wurenqiao said: "With state-owned stores (referring to Yuanxing), business is really good. Coal can be sold when it is brought, and grain can be bought when it is wanted, whether it is a market day or a free day."

　　Based on the above situation, under the policy of stabilizing prices, our state-owned stores have guaranteed the legitimate profits of legitimate merchants and peddlers in free trade, and greatly reduced the activities of speculative merchants, thus considerably exerting the leading role of state-owned stores in the market. Due to the basic stability of prices, the seasonal difference has been considerably reduced, alleviating the losses suffered by farmers every year in history due to the rise in prices in spring. For example, in Xinzhen, the price of millet in early October last year was 23,600 yuan per dou, and in early May this year it was 27,000 yuan, the change index in seven months only increased by 24.6%.

　　(2) We purchased and sold large quantities of people’s means of production: more than 660,000 bolts of homespun cloth, more than 1 million catties of saltpeter, more than 800,000 catties of mountain goods and Chinese yams, and 200,000 pieces of mats. Supplied the people’s production and life necessities, tools, and raw materials. In addition to more than 100 million catties of grain, there were also hundreds of thousands of catties of cotton, more than 80,000 catties of edible salt, 6 million catties of coal, nearly 10,000 catties of white oil, and some well-drilling equipment, ironware, and waterwheels. In addition, there were 1,000 large barrels of gasoline, 12,000 reams of writing paper, and 1,000 reams of imitation wood paper, with transportation costs of more than 14 billion yuan, which directly supported the development of handicraft industry, family sideline business, transportation industry, and agriculture in our region (of course, this achievement is far from enough). From March to May, the total amount of goods purchased and sold by stores under the Jizhong Company system was 904.249 billion yuan (including 495.965 billion yuan in business dealings and material transfers between stores in the company system). In such huge economic activities, it drove and developed the activities of many car companies, porters, private merchants, and peddlers in and near major towns, relatively quickly restored and prospered the market, and developed major towns. According to the transactions in the market days and weekdays of Xinji, Jiucheng, Wurenqiao, Xiaofan, and Hejian (the volume of grain transactions in the market in May this year increased by 3.6 times compared with October last year), it greatly facilitated merchants and people.

　　How did the achievements come about?

　　(1) First of all, there was a clear trade work policy and price stabilization policy, and the correct leadership of the border area trade company and the district party committee and administrative office, overcoming the purely profit-oriented view, localism, and blindness in price stabilization work, and gradually moving towards planned and step-by-step development.

　　(2) The close integration of finance and economy: part of the financial expenditure is completed through trade repayment, and the surplus materials in finance are handed over to the trade department for operation, turning dead finance into a living economy, which greatly increases the operating strength of the state-owned trade department.

　　(3) The cooperation and support of friendly regions, such as when prices fluctuated in our region in May, Hengshui in Ji'nan vigorously sold materials, strongly supporting our region's market, especially the Beiyue Region and Shijiazhuang Trading Company, which have always "fought side by side" with us and cooperated closely.

　　(4) In addition, it is also due to the active efforts, hard work, responsibility, hard work, and resolute implementation of instructions from higher authorities by responsible cadres and all staff of our stores at all levels.

　　Main shortcomings in the work:

　　(1) The price fluctuation in the entire region in mid-May (the average price increase was about 30%) was a serious shortcoming in our price stabilization work this spring. Although it was quickly calmed down, its harm was great. Especially in its impact on production, such as the sudden decrease in profits from textiles and various productions or temporary losses, the increased difficulties in the lives of disaster victims and poor peasants, and the losses suffered by the public and private sectors are difficult to calculate.

　　In addition to objective reasons, subjectively, first of all, we lacked the necessary investigation and research work, and our understanding of the situation was too poor. For example, we did not have enough understanding of the serious food shortage in Zhao, Gao, and other counties in the Eleventh Division and the disaster areas along the Zhengtai Line. Secondly, in the use of our own strength, we overemphasized the timely completion of the repayment plan and neglected the preservation of strength (did not prepare the strength to cope with unexpected consumption), so that in March and April, especially in the process of currency unification in the two regions, we excessively consumed our strength, resulting in insufficient follow-up. In determining the price difference between regions, the profit we left for private merchants was too small (peddlers benefited, but shopkeepers had no profit or little profit), and we could not stimulate a large number of private capital to invest in grain business, so that in stabilizing prices, we often formed our own independent operation, and failed to fully organize private capital and unite around us. This must be resolutely corrected in the future.

　　(2) The issue of supporting production: This year, according to the instructions from higher authorities, we generally paid attention to supporting production, but because we devoted our main energy to stabilizing prices, we did not do enough in planned support for production. This is reflected in: 1. We lacked systematic in-depth investigation and research and accurate calculations on the production and distribution of large-scale people’s livelihood products, such as homespun cloth, and only satisfied with simple large-scale purchases and sales. We cannot always maintain the necessary production profits for producers in different seasons, different regions, and complex price changes, and the management of homespun cloth is very blind. As for how to organize and develop production through production promotion societies and cooperatives, except for Yuanxing, the general practice is very poor. 2. We are not active or actively involved in some larger industries that need and can be driven and supported by our business operations (such as rolling mills, flour mills, oil mills, etc.), which is wrong. 3. For the "supply of large-scale production tools and production raw materials to the people," we lacked dedicated personnel to conduct investigation and research, and did not well combine with the organs that directly lead and organize production to understand the large-scale needs of the people in production, and vigorously organize this work.

　　(3) Many of our cadres have a kind of ruling ideology and petty-bourgeoisie style of doing business. They are afraid that merchants will make money and are afraid of losing money by combining with cooperatives and production promotion societies, so they want to do everything and want to do it themselves. This has resulted in too many stalls and a huge organization, not only dispersing funds and dispersing strength, weakening the leading role of the public economy in the market, but also hindering the development of the private economy and cooperative economy in some places (such as unnecessary retail stores and some unnecessary scattered businesses).

　　In the future, we should change our management methods from ideology and practical work, and actively unite and lead the private economy and the cooperative economy (currently focusing on the combination with the production promotion society).

　　(4) In terms of business management and business operations, we lack technology and experience, have poor control over capital loans, and are not good at warehouse management, resulting in many unnecessary losses. In the future, we must strengthen business management, improve business technology, and make accurate calculations, so as to obtain legitimate profits under the correct implementation and execution of trade policies. Accumulate wealth and strengthen ourselves, so as to enhance the leading power of the public economy and serve the people more.

　　冀中贸易公司五个月工作介绍
    冀中贸易公司（曾改名为德茂公司），一九四六年二月建立。下设总分店四十二个，几乎遍及冀中各主要城镇，与冀中工商业界与广大人民经济生活关系至为密切。现特将今年一至五月的主要工作简略介绍如下。
    今年工作所处的环境：
    （一）各解放区连成一片，环境相当稳定，交通发展，给了贸易工作较好环境。（二）去年年景不强，经过平分，贫雇农虽得到一部浮财，但去冬消耗较大，今春仍须部分购粮。冀中西南部地区，去秋灾荒严重。后因去冬平分开始，商贩骤形减少，各地物资未能作到应有的自然调剂，加深着灾区粮荒程度。（三）我区北部受敌区物价影响，粮食走私外流。东邻渤海虽属丰收之区，由于货币不统一，粮食亦未能大量经群众自然调剂流入我区。南邻冀南粮食尚能输入一部，但过去曾因货币不统一，后因法定比值（一比十）与自然比值（一比九上下）有一定距离，粮食亦未能畅流我区。西邻冀西尤其是正太沿线严重缺粮，粮食向陕甘宁晋绥西流，必须我区大量供给，这就更加重了我区供给食粮的负担。（四）平分以后大生产运动的开展，大批农贷与工业投资，货币增发了相当数量，潜伏了物价上涨的基本因素。（五）去年平分开始，物价曾一度暴落，贷币在群众手中成为储存手段，增加了今春的物价波动。
    五个月来的主要工作：
    （一）今春物价在我们的掌握下，除五月份一度波动外，基本上保持了物价的稳升。即在五月物价情况突然变化时，在我大力组织调运支援友区（调拨到石门粮一二四○万斤、北岳区一五○○万斤），大力供给市场需要之下（只三、四、五月份即出售粗粮五八八二万斤，小麦三○九六万斤），使物价的突然暴涨归于平稳。这主要表现在：
    一、年底群众争购粮食（尤其是小麦）准备过年，当时如果没我商店的大量供给，必然形成暴涨。过年后才开市时，市场上粮极少，亦形成争购现象，依靠公营商店的足够供给，物价保持了平稳。根据当时统计，河间我出售粮食数字占群众上市量的十三倍、伍仁桥占三倍、端村占三倍。商店与广大群众建立了密切联系，威信大为提高。
    二、四月份敌人一度进扰冀中腹地河间，在我战时坚持出售物资支持货币稳定物价的紧急措施下，物价未引起任何变动。
    三、四月中旬两区贷币统一，这是一件经济活动中的重大变化。但因法定比值与自然比值相差百分之十左右，因此冀南来粮顿形减少，甚至引起食粮倒流。假如没有我公营商店的大力出售，及冀南公营商店的大力配合，必然引起一度波动。
    除五月份一度物价波动外，全区基本上保持了地区间、商品间的合理差额，保持了物资正常流动，有力的支援了灾区、工业区、与山地渡过了春荒。我们保证了一切运输者的适当利润。今春运输业大大发展，只我公司系统下的商店不完全的统计即开支运费一百四十余亿元。也使正当商人特别是小贩得到了利润。伍仁桥某商贩说：“有了公营商店（指元兴说）买卖真好做，拉来煤炭准卖了、想买粮食准能买上，无论集日或闲日。”
    根据以上情况我公营商店，在稳定物价方针下，在自由贸易中，保证了正当商人小贩的正当利润，并大大减少了投机商人活动，这样就相当的发挥了公营商店在市场上的领导作用。由于物价的基本稳定，相当的缩小了季节性的差额，减轻了农民历史上每年来因春季物价上涨所受的损失。如辛集去年十月上旬小米价每斗二三六○○元，今年五月上旬为二七○○○元，七个月的变化指数仅增加百分之二十四点六。
    （二）收购与推销了群众的大宗生产品，土布六十六万余匹，火硝一百余万斤，山货山药八十余万斤，席子廿万片。供给了群众生产中与生活中所必须的物品、工具和原料。除粮食一万万余斤外，尚有棉花数十万斤，食盐八万余斤，煤炭六百万斤，白油近一万余斤，及打井器材铁货、水车等一部。此外尚有汽油一千大桶、盘纸一万二千盘，模造纸一千领，开支运费一百四十余亿，这样就直接扶植了我区手工业家庭副业运输业以及农业的发展（当然这个成绩是十分不够的）。自三月至五月按冀中公司系统商店进销货额九○四二·四九亿（其中包括公司系统各店间业务来往与物资调拨四九五九·六五亿）。在这样巨大的经济活动中，带动与发展了各主要城镇及其附近不少车行、脚户、私商、小贩的活动，比较迅速的恢复与繁荣了市场，并且发展了主要城镇。根据辛集、旧城、伍仁桥、小范、河间集日与平日成交（今年五月市场粮食成交量比去年十月增大了三·六倍），大大便利了商民。
    成绩是怎样来的？
    （一）首先有了明确的贸易工作方针政策与稳定物价的政策，及边区贸易公司与区党委、行署的正确领导，克服了单纯盈利观点、本位主义及稳定物价工作中的盲目性，而逐渐走向有计划有步骤。
    （二）财政经济的密切结合：财政上一部分开支通过贸易回拢完成，财政上多余物资交贸易部门经营，死财政变为活经济，大大增加了公营贸易部门的经营力量。
    （三）友区的配合与支持，如五月我区物价波动时，冀南衡水大力抛售物资，有力的支援了我区市场，尤其是北岳区与石门贸易公司，始终与我们“并肩作战”，密切配合。
    （四）此外也由于我各级商店负责干部及全体人员的积极努力、艰苦负责、埋头苦干、坚决执行上级指示。
    工作中的主要缺点：
    （一）五月中旬全区物价波动（物价平均上涨百分之三十左右）是我今春稳定物价工作中的严重缺点，虽然不久即告平息，但其危害甚大。特别是在其打击生产上如纺织及各种生产利润的骤形降低或一时亏本，灾民贫农生活增加困难，公私所受损失是难以计算的。
    除了客观原因外，在主观上首先是我们缺乏必要的调查研究工作，了解情况太差。如对十一分区赵、藁等县及正太沿线灾区严重缺粮程度没足够的认识。其次在本身力量使用上则是过分强调了按期完成回拢计划，忽视实力的保存（没有准备应付意外消耗的力量），以致在三、四月份，尤其是在两区货币统一的过程中，过分的消耗了力量，形成后力不继。在确定各地区间物价差额上，我们给私商所留的利润太小（小贩有利，座商无利或利小），无法刺激大批私人资本投入粮食经营，以致在稳定物价中，往往形成我们孤军作战，未能充分把私人资本组织起来，团结在我们周围。这是今后必须坚决改正的。
    （二）扶植生产问题：今年我们根据上级指示，一般的注意了扶植生产，但由于把主要精力用于稳定物价，在有计划的扶植生产上做得还是十分不够。这表现在：一、对大宗群众生产品，如土布等的生产分销情况及具体生产过程，缺乏系统的深入的调查研究与精确计算，只是以简单的大量收购与推销为满足。不能在不同季节、不同地区以及在复杂的物价变化中，经常保持生产者必需的生产利润，对土布的经营带有很大的盲目性。至于如何通过生产推进社、合作社，组织与发展生产，除元兴外，一般的做的是很差的。二、有些较大的工业，需要而且可能通过我们业务经营带动与扶植的（如轧工厂、火磨、榨油厂等），我们不主动不积极的结合，这是不对的。三、对于“供给人民大宗的生产工具和生产原料”，我们一面缺乏专人进行调查研究，也未很好与直接领导与组织生产的机关结合起来，了解人民生产上的大宗需要，并大力组织这一工作。
    （三）我们不少干部思想上，存在着一种统治思想与小商人作风，害怕商人赚钱，怕与合作社、生产推进社结合吃了亏，因此什么都想做，而且想自己亲手做。造成自己的摊子多组织庞大，不但资金分散力量分散，削弱公营经济在市场间的领导作用，而且某些地方（如不必要的门市部与某些不必要的零星业务等）还妨害了私营经济、合作经济的发展。
    今后应该从思想与实际工作上来转变我们的经营方法，主动的团结与领导私营经济与合作经济（当前着重与生产推进社的结合）。
    （四）在事业管理与业务经营上，更缺乏技术与经验，资金贷款掌握不紧，仓库保管不力，造成许多不应有的损失。今后必须加强事业管理，提高经营技术、精确计算，在正确的贯彻与执行贸易方针政策下，获得正当利润。积累财富壮大自己，以便增强公营经济的领导力量，更多的为人民服务。
