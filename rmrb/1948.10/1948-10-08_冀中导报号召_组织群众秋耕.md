　　Ji Zhong Dao Bao Calls for
    Organizing the Masses for Autumn Cultivation
    [Ji Zhong Electric] Ji Zhong Dao Bao recently published an editorial entitled "Intensify Leadership in Autumn Cultivation," stating: In the past one or two years, autumn cultivation in various places has been done poorly due to various reasons. This year, severe insect plagues have occurred relatively widely in various parts of Ji Zhong. This necessitates seizing the opportunity this autumn to mobilize and organize the masses to carry out relatively widespread autumn cultivation, so that the land can rest, absorb sunlight, conserve water, and minimize and prevent insect pests next year, laying a better foundation for next year's large-scale production campaign. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must attach great importance to this year's autumn cultivation work and must do a good job in autumn cultivation after the autumn harvest and wheat planting in order to successfully complete the autumn production work. First, it should be recognized that although land has been distributed in most areas, land certificates have not yet been widely issued. In particular, in the past few years, land reform was carried out after autumn. Now, in places where land has already been distributed and land reform has been declared complete, some people still have doubts and are waiting to see. In addition, a small number of places have not yet distributed land or have not distributed it well. The masses will still have some concerns during autumn planting, which will increase difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to deeply publicize the Ji Zhong Administrative Office's announcement on determining land rights. For land that has not been distributed well or has not yet been distributed, it is also necessary to conscientiously organize universal autumn cultivation. It should be clearly announced that even if a small number or individual pieces of land may be subject to supplementary adjustments, it will definitely be guaranteed that the original autumn cultivation will be compensated to the land distribution households with equivalent value, in order to dispel concerns and encourage people of all strata to implement autumn cultivation as much as possible. Secondly, the benefits of autumn cultivation should be widely publicized, and the habit of diligent cultivation should be promoted. However, when specifically organizing autumn cultivation, it is necessary to be realistic and practical and act according to circumstances. In areas where there is no habit of autumn cultivation, the experience of autumn cultivation should be introduced through experienced farmers, focusing on enlightenment and publicity. For places where autumn cultivation cannot be carried out due to soil quality or waterlogging, do not mobilize the masses for autumn cultivation. In a few places, if bad soil is turned up by plowing, or if it is prone to wind damage after plowing, which affects next year's spring plowing and sowing, autumn cultivation in such places will be harmful. Therefore, the implementation of autumn cultivation should be specific to each village, each household, and each piece of land. It is necessary to carefully investigate and learn from the agricultural experience of the masses, and do it in a differentiated and realistic manner. It is necessary to combine universal publicity with specific leadership. Blindly forcing the masses to carry out autumn cultivation across the board without considering the situation will create mistakes and alienate the masses. The central problem of autumn cultivation is to solve the difficulty of the lack of livestock and to mobilize the masses to voluntarily organize livestock. In autumn cultivation, the masses should continue to be organized to freely and voluntarily exchange manpower and animal power, implement temporary labor exchange and cooperative plowing, and implement methods such as hiring short-term workers for contracted cultivation. Attention should also be paid to appropriately resolving the difficulties of military families in autumn cultivation. It is also necessary to combine autumn cultivation, war service, and support for the front well, so that manpower and animal power support for the front and attendance do not affect autumn cultivation as much as possible, and those who have already attended can also guarantee autumn cultivation. After autumn, a vigorous campaign to collect fertilizer in autumn and winter should be launched, advocating raising pigs to make manure, and opening flour mills and oil mills, etc.; collecting fertilizer should be treated as a regular and important matter in the whole year's production. Finally, attention should be paid to combining autumn cultivation with the completion of land reform, the correction of wrongly determined class status, and the adjustment of village-level organizations, and other important tasks currently facing various villages. In areas affected by floods where autumn cultivation cannot be carried out, efforts should be focused on production and disaster relief, and the development of sideline production.

　　冀中导报号召
    组织群众秋耕
    【冀中电】冀中导报顷以“加紧领导秋耕”为题发表社论称：近一、二年来，各地秋耕由于种种原因做得都很差，今年冀中各地又曾较普遍的发生了严重的虫灾，这就需要在今年秋后，抓紧时机，发动组织群众进行比较普遍的秋耕，以使土地得到休息，更得到吸收阳光，保存水量，并可尽量减少和预防明年的虫害，为明年的大生产运动做下更好的准备。因此，各级党委必须十分重视今年的秋耕工作，在秋收种麦以后，必须接着把秋耕做好，才能胜利完成秋季生产工作。首先应认识到绝大部分地区土地虽已分好，但因土地证还没普遍颁发，特别是过去几年来秋后就作土改，现在土地已经分好的地方虽已宣布结束土改，但有些群众还有些怀疑观望，另有少数地方还没有分地或没有分好，群众在秋种中还会存在一些顾虑，这些都会增加困难，因此必须深入宣传冀中行署确定地权的布告。对于一些未分好或还没分的土地，也必须认真组织普遍秋耕，应明确宣布即使有少数或个别土地可能抽补变动，也一定保证原地秋耕后由分地户如数补还相当代价，以打破顾虑，鼓励各阶层人民都尽量实行秋耕。其次应普遍宣传秋耕的好处，提倡勤耕的习惯。但是具体组织秋耕时，必须实事求是，根据情况办事。对没有秋耕习惯地区，应经过老农介绍秋耕经验，着重进行启发宣传。对于因土质关系或水涝地不能实行秋耕的地方，就不要去发动群众秋耕。有少数地方，如果耕了翻上坏土来或耕后容易犯风，影响明年的春耕播种，这样地方秋耕就有害处。因此实行秋耕应具体到一村一家一块地，必须细心调查，学习群众的农事经验，有分别的实事求是的去做。必须把普遍宣传和具体领导结合起来，那种盲目不看情况的强迫群众一定都要秋耕一遍，就会造成错误，脱离群众。秋耕的中心问题是解决牲口缺乏的困难和发动群众自愿组织牲口的问题，在秋耕中应继续组织群众自由自愿的交换人力畜力，实行临时的换工插犋，实行雇短工包耕等办法。并且应注意适当解决军属秋耕的困难，还必须使秋耕、战勤和支前工作很好结合，做到使人畜力支前出勤尽量不影响秋耕，使已经出勤的也能保证秋耕。秋后应发动积极开展秋冬集肥运动，提倡喂猪造粪，和开粉坊、油坊等；应把集肥当作全年生产中经常重要的事情来做。最后应注意把秋耕和结束土改、改正错订成份和调整村级组织等各村当前不同的重要工作结合去做，在水灾区不能实行秋耕的地方，就应抓紧生产救灾，开展副业生产。
