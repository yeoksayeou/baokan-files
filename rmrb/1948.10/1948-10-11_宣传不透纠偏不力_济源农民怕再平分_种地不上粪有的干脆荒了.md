　　[Taiyue Telegram] 社记者报导: Starting on September 22nd, our correspondent participated in three days of reporting meetings from various districts in Jiyuan concerning the Three Autumn Campaigns. The reports universally reflected one problem: the masses still fear a redistribution of land after the autumn harvest, greatly impacting their production enthusiasm. In Miaojie Village, due to land scarcity (averaging one mu per person), in previous years people eagerly rented land from landlords, even with rents as high as eight or nine dou per mu. Now, however, over two hundred mu of land lies fallow. The Wangwu Mountain area, known as a land of rice and wheat, annually sold most of its produce to the Jiyuan-Meng Plain area, except for a small portion used locally. But this year, due to low production enthusiasm and poor land cultivation, the grain produced is barely enough for self-sufficiency. In Shaoyuan Town, over eighty mules and horses are leaving fields uncultivated to engage solely in transportation. Kong Fanbi, a middle peasant in Kongzhuang Village, Fifth District, doesn't apply fertilizer to his land. When asked why, he said, "It's ours now, but who knows whose it will be after the autumn harvest." Wei Naixiu, a clerk in the First District, told the reporter that some peasants in the Miaojie area have also abandoned the land they were allocated. When district cadres asked them why they weren't cultivating, they evasively replied, "I don't know if that piece of land was given to me." In reality, they were afraid to cultivate it. Based on the above situation, finding a way to eliminate these concerns of the masses is indeed the key to unfolding the Three Autumn Campaigns. However, many cadres still don't understand this. They don't start by resolving the masses' production concerns, but instead subjectively issue calls to organize mutual aid and labor exchange, and organize challenge competitions. Of course, this cannot but be formalistic and coercive. Some masses say, "You people interfere too much! We wouldn't even know how to produce if you didn't lead us!" Some cadres, upon hearing such feedback, don't consider the reasons behind it, but angrily say that the masses are backward, don't listen to leadership, and simply give up. In reality, it's not that the masses are unwilling to become prosperous, but rather that they still have ideological concerns. This can be proven by some villages where correction work has been done relatively well. Although many poor peasants in Xiajie Village were wrongly struggled against, because the correction work was relatively thorough, the production enthusiasm of all classes is relatively stable, achieving fine tilling and weeding, and reaching seventy percent of the harvest in a fifty percent year. Therefore, using all means to dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, such as implementing corrections, appropriately providing compensation and resettlement, and explaining to peasants in villages where land reform has been completed that land will no longer be changed in the future, explaining that the government guarantees the human rights, land rights, and property rights of all classes after the end of land reform, so that the masses can produce with peace of mind, should become the urgent task at hand.

　　宣传不透纠偏不力
    济源农民怕再平分
    种地不上粪有的干脆荒了
    【太岳电】分社记者报导：从九月二十二日开始，记者在济源连续参加三天各区关于三秋运动的汇报会议。汇报中普遍反映出一个问题：群众仍害怕秋后要平分，大大影响了生产情绪。庙街村因为地缺（平均每人一亩地），往年租种地主土地，每亩要八九斗租子还抢着种，现在土地却荒了二百余亩。王屋山地区素称米麦之乡，每年除一小部分供本地需用外，其余都运到济孟平原地带销售；但今年因为生产情绪不高，土地耕作不好，所产粮食仅够自给。邵原镇八十余头骡马，荒下田地，专搞运输。五区孔庄村中农孔繁弼种地不上粪，别人问他为什么，他说：“现在是咱的，秋后还不知是谁的。”一区分书卫乃修对记者说，庙街一带有些农民，分到的土地也荒了。区干部问他们为什么不种，他们支吾说：“不知那块地分给了我。”实际是不敢种。从以上情况看，设法消除群众这些顾虑，确是展开三秋运动的关键。但还有不少干部对此并没有了解，他们不从解除群众生产顾虑入手，却主观主义的号召组织互助变工，组织挑战竞赛，当然不能不是形式主义的，强迫命令的。有的群众说：“就是你们管的宽！不领导我们还不知道生产！”有的干部听了这样反映，也不考虑其原因何在，就很生气的说群众落后，不听领导，躺倒不干了，其实，并不是群众不愿致富，而是因为还有思想顾虑。这可以从一些纠偏工作做得较好的村子来证明。下街村虽然错斗中贫农不少，但因纠偏比较彻底，各阶层生产情绪即较稳定，做到地肥锄细，五成年景达到了七成收。因此，用一切办法解除群众思想顾虑，如贯彻纠偏，适当进行补偿安置，在土改完成的村子向农民说明今后土地不再变动，说明政府在土改结束之后保障各阶层人权、地权、财权，使群众安心生产，应成为当前急务。
