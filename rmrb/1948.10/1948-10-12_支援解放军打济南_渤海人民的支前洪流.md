　　Supporting the People's Liberation Army in the Battle of Jinan
    ——The Torrent of Support from the Bohai People

    "The People's Liberation Army is attacking Jinan!"
    The vast Bohai Plain was shaken by this victorious call, and millions of people were stirred up.

    On the highway west of ×× City, an endless stream of carrying teams marched swiftly towards the southwest.
    "Which county?" "Shouguang..."
    "The young men of Houzhen are worth five!"
    An old man jokingly said, "Going to Jinan to deliver noodles to Wang Yaowu!"
    A laborer asked several soldiers, "Comrades, are you going to Jinan?" He then pointed to the burden on his shoulder and said, "With this, I can also earn merit like you!"

    On the evening of the thirteenth, large mules, taller than a person, dragged cannons, one after another, hurriedly passing by ×× City westward. The soldiers excitedly looked at the inspiring slogans along the way: "The People's Liberation Army, like fierce tigers, are determined to take Jinan!" The Yucheng stretcher team followed behind. The team members made their own anti-aircraft hats out of sorghum leaves and vines, with novel designs, which made the people on the street laugh. They had been serving with the army for more than four months, and this time they were even more motivated to fight Jinan.
    "Going around and around, we're back again!"
    "This time we're going to raid his mother's old nest!" They shouted as they walked.

    In the counties north of the Jiaoji Railway, many support-the-front models and support-the-front heroes once again rushed to the front line. They welcomed this glorious offensive with even more enthusiasm than before. "This is a big battle to liberate all of Shandong!" said a simple, reticent farmer named Zhang Bai'an, the second platoon leader of the first company of the first battalion of the Shouguang Militia Regiment. Every time there was support for the front, he was the first to go. People in the village gave him the nickname "Support-the-Front Addict." There was no "addiction"; it was just that he realized it was to protect his good life after he had turned over.

    Thousands of cadres and laborers shared hardships, demonstrating the new strength after the rectification campaign. On the dusty road, the white flour burdens of the Shouguang Porter Group crowded forward. Their leader, Comrade Liu Huiyun, the Minister of Armed Forces of the county party committee, also carried a heavy load along with them, his shoulders red and swollen from the pressure. Those who knew him well knew that he had severe rheumatism in his legs.

    The good news spread quickly, and everywhere people could be seen busily sweating for one thing. In Huantai, Zouping, Yaonan... and other places, thousands of carts and stretchers were organized to wait for deployment. In front of the grain depot in ×× District, the delivery of processed grain was like a market. As we marched to Shijiazhuang in Diaozhen District, Zhangqiu County, our landlady, Auntie Yan, said, "The firewood and white flour have been prepared long ago. How many people have come? I've really been looking forward to it. We won't suffer from the scourge of the Kuomintang bandits anymore!" Her eight- or nine-year-old child tilted his head and asked, "Is Jinan very big?"

    The people are even closer to their own troops. In Xiangyangdian, Zouping, just as the troops sat down on the street, a comrade suddenly ran east, taking a small load of hot water from an old woman's shoulder. People looked at the old woman with curious eyes. It turned out that she had a bright red cloth tied around her white hair. She leaned on a cane, bent over, and said with a smile, "An eighty-two-year-old is really useless; I can't even deliver this little water to the comrades!" Everyone then realized that the red cloth was tied up for her eightieth birthday celebration.

    Almost everyone showed an unprecedented emotion, which was the unwavering conviction of victory in the offensive. Some people said that during the attack on Changwei, they still heard discussions behind the backs of the laborers: "Can we really take it?" But this time, no such questions were heard among the laborers. Merchants from Jinan said that the officials' wives in Licheng were desperately fleeing west, the cars were so crowded that they were about to burst, and those who couldn't squeeze in were running around in a panic on the ground. When the rumbling cannons sounded on the eighteenth, the masses in the eighth district of Zhangqiu County returned from the front after delivering combat equipment. They said in a firm and cheerful tone: "We delivered it all the way to the foot of Licheng. In my opinion, it won't be long before we can break in!"

    "Attack Jinan!"
    —This sound is really inspiring. People are paying the price of blood and sweat with conscious bravery, and people seem to have already seen the long-term prospects in the near future: one hundred thousand anti-people armed forces will be eliminated! The scenic Shandong provincial capital will belong to the people, and the 700,000 people of Jinan will see the light of day again. And around it, how many more places will be freed from the Kuomintang bandits' burning, killing, and looting and gain liberation! After the liberation of Jinan, the Bohai Liberated Area, and even the entire Shandong Liberated Area, can more freely carry out large-scale production and construction to support the national liberation war.

### 支援解放军打济南——渤海人民的支前洪流

　　支援解放军打济南
    ——渤海人民的支前洪流
    “解放军攻打济南啦!”
    广大的渤海平原，为这胜利的号召所震动，几百万人民被激动了起来。
    ××城向西的公路上，一眼望不见边的挑子队，健步如飞的涌向西南。
    “哪一县？”“寿光……”
    “候镇的小伙子一个顶五个！”
    一个老汉打趣的说：“上济南给王耀武送面去！”
    一个民工向几个战士问：“同志，上济南吗？”又指一指自己肩上的担子说：“凭这个也能象你们一样的立功啊！”
    十三号傍晚，经××城向西，高人一头的大骡子拖着大炮，一辆辆匆匆地走过去。战士们兴奋的看那沿途激动人心的标语：“解放军，如猛虎，一心要打济南府！”禹城担架队跟随在后面，队员们用高粱叶子、蔓草自己编成的防空帽子，花样翻新，街上的人看了都哈哈大笑。他们随军服务已四个多月了，这回打济南劲头更大啦。
    “转来转去又转回来啦！”
    “这回可掏他娘的老窝了！”他们一面走一面嚷着。
    胶济路以北各县，不少支前模范、支前功臣，这一次又奔赴前线。他们怀着比过去更饱满的情绪，来迎接这次光荣的进攻。“这是解放全山东的大仗！”一个质朴不爱说话的农民这样说，他名叫张百安，寿光民兵团一营一连二排长，那一次支前都争先去，庄里人送他个外号“支前瘾”。那里有什么“瘾”，只不过他觉悟到：是为了保护自己翻身后的好日子。
    成千的干部和民工共负艰苦，他们表现出整党以后的新的力量。在尘土弥漫的大路上，寿光挑夫团的白面担子拥挤前进，他们的团长——县委武装部长刘会云同志，即同样肩负重担一同前进，他的肩膀压的红肿了。熟悉他的人，都知道他的腿有严重的风湿病。
    喜讯飞快的传播，到处可见到人们为着一件事忙碌流汗，在桓台、邹平、耀南………等地，成千的小车、担架组织起来等候调用，在××区粮库的门前，送加工粮的象集市一般。我们行军到章历县刁镇区史家庄，房东颜大娘说：“火头、白面早预备好了，你们来了多少人啊？真盼到头了，往后再也不受国民党匪军的祸害了！”她的八九岁的孩子歪着头问：“济南府很大吗？”
    人民对自己的队伍是更加亲密了。在邹平香阳店，队伍刚在街上坐下，一个同志忽然跑向东去，从一个老人肩上接下一小担热水，人们都以奇异的眼光看那老人，原来她花白的头发上扎着一条鲜红的布缕，她拄了拐杖，弯着腰走，一面笑嘻嘻的说：“八十二岁的人真不中用了，给同志们送这点水就办不了！”大家才知道那红布缕是庆八十扎起来的。
    几乎是所有的人，都表现了一种前所未有的情绪，那就是对进攻胜利的确信无疑。有人说：在进攻昌潍时，还听到民工们背后的议论：“准能打下吗？”但这一次在民工中，再也没有听见这种疑问了。从济南来的商人则说：历城的官太太们正拼命向西逃窜，汽车挤的快破肚皮了，挤不上去的就在地下心慌意乱的奔走。当十八日隆隆的炮声传来的时候，章邱八区的群众送战斗器材从前方回来，他们以坚定愉快的语调说：“一直送到历城根底下，以我看不多时就能攻进去！”
    “打济南啦！”
    —这声音实在叫人振奋。人们正以自觉的勇猛，付出血和汗的代价，人们也似乎已经看到不久以后的远景，十万反人民武装将被消灭！山明水秀的山东省会将属于人民，七十万济南人民将重见天日。而在它周围，又有多少地方将摆脱国民党匪军的烧杀掠夺而获得解放！济南解放以后，渤海解放区以至整个山东解放区，就更可以放手进行大规模生产建设，以支援全国解放战争了。
