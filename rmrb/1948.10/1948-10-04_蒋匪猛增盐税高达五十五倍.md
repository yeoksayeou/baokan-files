　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Following its predatory "currency reform," the Kuomintang government, on August 26th, promulgated and implemented the so-called "Measures for Reorganizing Finance and Supplementing Resources" through an emergency order, generally raising tax rates. Among these, the salt tax alone was drastically increased from the original rate of 450,000 Legal Tender per dan to 8 yuan in puppet Gold Yuan (equivalent to 24 million Legal Tender), a staggering 55-fold increase. Note: Salt is a necessity for the people's diet, and the burden of taxation actually falls on the general populace. After the salt tax increase, salt prices followed suit with sharp rises. According to the *Tianjin Ta Kung Pao* on August 29th, the Tianjin warehouse price was originally 8.46 million Legal Tender per dan, but rose to 11.10 yuan in puppet Gold Yuan (equivalent to 33.30 million Legal Tender) on August 28th, a sudden increase of approximately four times. The retail price, originally 80,000 Legal Tender per jin, rose to as high as 360,000. Not only that, but the Fu Zuoyi bandit gang also levied a "Self-Defense Special Donation" of 8 yuan in puppet Gold Yuan per dan on salt merchants' stored salt purchased at the old warehouse price, an extreme act of exploitation. According to the *Tianjin Yih Shih Pao* on August 29th, all parties in Tianjin were generally dissatisfied with this salt tax increase and price hike, believing that the Kuomintang authorities, on the one hand, forced the freezing of various commodity prices to the prices of August 19th, while on the other hand, increased the price of salt under its control by several times. The newspaper likened this action to "the magistrate being allowed to set fires, while the common people are not allowed to light lamps."

　　蒋匪猛增盐税高达五十五倍
    【新华社陕北三日电】国民党政府继其掠夺性的“币改”之后，又于八月廿六日以紧急命令方式公布实施所谓“整理财政补充办法”，普遍提高税率，其中盐税一项由原税率每担法币四十五万元，猛然提升至每担伪金圆券八元（合法币二千四百万元），税率遽增竟达五十五倍之多。按：食盐为民食必需品，税收的负担实际上是落在一般平民身上。盐税增加以后，盐价跟随猛升。据八月廿九日津大公报载，天津仓价原为每担法币八百四十六万元，八月二十八日升至伪金圆券十一元一角（合法币三千三百三十万元），突涨约四倍。零售价原为每斤法币八万元有涨至三十六万元者。不仅如此，傅作义匪帮对盐商以旧仓价购进的存盐又补征每担“自卫特捐”伪金圆券八元，敲骨吸髓，到了极点。据八月二十九日天津益世报讯，津各方对于这次食盐增税加价普遍不满，认为国民党当局一方面强迫各种物价冻结于八月十九日价上，另一方面却将其统制下的食盐加了几倍价，该报几此举为“只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯”。
