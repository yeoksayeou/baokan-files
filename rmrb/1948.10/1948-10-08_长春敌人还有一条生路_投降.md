　　The Enemies in Changchun Have One Last Way Out: Surrender
　　No matter how the Kuomintang bandit gang deceives them, the garrison in Changchun now has only one way out: to surrender as soon as possible. They once placed their last hope on airdrops, but now even that last hope is gone. For a long time, the transport planes flying over Changchun have numbered no more than four or five per day at most. Under the obstruction of the People's Liberation Army's dense anti-aircraft fire, these planes can only hide high in the clouds and make aimless drops. As a result, white parachutes, black sacks, along with rice, clothing, ammunition, and even whole fat pigs inside the sacks, often fall in large quantities onto the People's Liberation Army's positions. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 3,000 bags of airdropped rice alone have been collected by the People's Liberation Army. Sometimes parachutes land between the two armies' positions, and the People's Liberation Army monitors them with fire during the day, and at night they become gifts without receipts. Some are lucky enough to fall into the city, but because they don't land at the designated locations, they are mostly snatched up by starving people or pocketed by a few quick-footed officers. Orders like "those who steal and hide will be shot on the spot" are even less effective at this time than usual. The Kuomintang army in Changchun numbers 100,000, and each person needs 1.5 jin of grain per day, requiring 150,000 jin of grain daily. However, a large enemy plane can only carry a maximum of 6,000 jin, which is a drop in the bucket even if all of it hits the target; moreover, most of it cannot be recovered, and airdrops are impossible in rainy weather. Especially recently, perhaps due to corruption among aviation personnel or other reasons, many sacks full of bricks and stones have been dropped, and some are completely empty. This is the result of the airdrops.
　　According to Changchun deserters, since the beginning of August, except for the 38th Division of the New 7th Army, which can still occasionally eat a small amount of rice and mostly soybeans once a week in a "big rice meal," the 182nd Division of the 60th Army can barely manage to use one-third sorghum rice as a "starter" mixed with soybeans; the remaining four regular divisions have to issue "grain allowances" because they often cannot receive military rations, and desperately search the citizens. As for the cavalry brigade, security brigade, and other non-regular troops, they are assigned an area and eat whatever they can grab. In this way, the little food left in the homes of residents in and around Changchun has become "military rations" for the bandits to plunder at will, and the furniture, doors, windows, and beams of the people's homes have first become their fuel. Thousands of houses in the suburbs have been almost completely demolished, and the demolition has already moved towards the central area. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have been driven to a desperate situation by the Chiang bandit army as temporary scapegoats, so they are forced to rise up and fight the plunderers to the death. Recently, incidents of citizens rising up to grab rice, seize guns, catch spies (plainclothes agents), and attack sentries have emerged one after another. The rice grabbing struggle is particularly widespread. Tens of thousands of starving people gather in the suburbs every day, waiting for Kuomintang planes to drop rice. As long as it is not dropped at a fixed location guarded by bandit troops, most of it is snatched up by starving people. Once, several grain trucks of the bandit army passed through Qima Road, and a group of starving people rushed up and the bandit army opened fire to suppress them, killing and wounding several people, but the grain trucks were eventually looted. The starving people said, "Why are they (referring to the bandit army) allowed to rob us? Anyway, we will starve to death if we don't rob, why should we let us starve to death and let them live!?" Spies, who are most hated by the citizens, are often beaten to death or injured, or captured alive and sent to the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army front line receives hundreds of long and short guns seized from the Chiang bandits by the citizens of Changchun almost every day.
　　Changchun, which is temporarily still ruled by the reactionaries, has become such a precarious hell on earth. But not far outside the city is a completely different world. Here, the endless fields present a nearly ten-fold harvest scene. While the People's Liberation Army is eliminating the Chiang bandits around Changchun, it is also assisting the democratic government in launching a widespread production and disaster relief campaign, saving 200,000 disaster victims from the brink of death. Refugees fleeing from bandit-occupied areas are being introduced to stable rear areas to settle down and find employment. In Balipu, a suburb alone, more than 10,000 disaster victims have been saved from death by the relief of the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government. This area is one of the "grabbing areas" of the Chiang bandit army in Changchun. Under the brutal plunder of the Chiang bandit army's "killing the people to support the army," there used to be a market for selling human flesh. Citizens of Changchun flock to the liberated areas in an endless stream. More than 1,000 teachers and students from Changchun University alone have fled to Jilin Northeast University to teach and study. The soldiers and lower-ranking officers of the Changchun garrison, who have been deceived by the Sino-American reactionaries in every possible way, when they realize from the countless examples they have heard and seen that joining the People's Liberation Army is their only way out, and know that the People's Liberation Army does indeed treat surrendered officers and soldiers leniently, they also try every possible means to find opportunities to defect to the liberated areas. According to the statistics of the People's Liberation Army Changchun Front Command, in the eighty days from June 25 to September 15, it has accommodated 15,400 fleeing Chiang army officers and soldiers, accounting for more than 15% of the total strength of the defending enemy. Among them, there are about 300 field-grade officers.
　　What hope is there in holding on to Changchun to the death? Even the bandit leader Zheng Dongguo feels extremely pessimistic. According to Zhang Dexin, the president of Changchun University who went from Changchun to Harbin, someone once asked Zheng what his opinion was on the university's relocation. He said with a bitter smile: "If I were the president of Changchun University, I would not advocate moving. If Changchun is lost, can Beiping still be defended? In China, no place is safe; to be safe, you can only move to the United States." Another time, several journalists asked him: "The Communist Party compares Changchun to a big prison, what is your opinion?" His answer was: "That's right! I am the warden!" Now Changchun has reached the point where, as the saying goes, "there is no way to heaven, and no way to enter the earth." What place can this warden and his jailers escape to except to accept the advice of the People's Liberation Army and lay down their arms as soon as possible?
　　Changchun is already cold. Winter is very scary for the enemy who is out of food and aid, and is hungry and cold. Only surrender is the way out for them to save themselves and save others. Holding on to the death means waiting to die. Even Zheng Dongguo's wife and other Chiang bandit officials thousands of miles away can see this clearly. On August 16, the People's Liberation Army seized four bundles of mail containing documents, newspapers, and thousands of public and private letters from the items "airdropped" by Chiang's planes to Changchun. Among them was a letter from Zheng Dongguo's wife, Chen ×lian (the middle character is unclear). It began with a series of exclamation marks: "You have been defending Changchun alone for several months, and the central government does not care about this, which is very disheartening! I only ask God to protect your safety! I am very anxious because I can't get any news about you!" In a letter from Wu Chun of the so-called "Nanjing Presidential Palace" to Shang Chuandao, the Kuomintang mayor of Changchun, it proves that Bandit Shang is actively seeking the position of member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The letter stated: "Regarding the matter of asking Chairman Chen (Chen Yi) to transfer you to the position of provincial committee member, I once telegraphed the opinion of Commander-in-Chief Wei, and then received a reply stating that your task is important and you cannot leave. The Executive Yuan also believed that Commander-in-Chief Wei may not fully understand the local situation, and telegraphed Chairman Zheng again, but has not received a reply. Please discuss with Chairman Zheng in a consultative manner so that you can quickly go south." Leng Ke, the former colonel chief of staff of the 60th Army who is now employed in the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, wrote several airmail letters to his superiors in a row. In his letter to Long Guojun, chief of staff of the New 7th Army, he wrote: "Changchun and Shenyang are not good, and Nanjing is even worse. The war situation on both sides of the Yangtze River is difficult to be optimistic about. Yanzhou followed Kaifeng in falling, and the current situation in Changchun cannot be reversed. Once the season permits, the situation in Jilin will be repeated." But in a letter to a "Section Chief Liao" at the Fifty Division's garrison office, the writer also said that the method of the enemy escaping to Changchun like before in Jilin is not a solution: "Changchun is very dangerous, what will you do? If the troops rush out, do not follow them, it is very dangerous. The entire route from Changchun to Shenyang is occupied by the Communist army. You will collapse long before you reach Shenyang; it is better to be a prisoner."

### 长春敌人还有一条生路——投降

　　长春敌人还有一条生路——投降
    不管国民党匪帮如何欺骗，长春的守军现在只有早点投降，才是唯一的生路。他们曾经把最后希望寄托于飞机的空投，现在这最后希望也不行了。好久以来，每天飞临长春上空的运输机，最多不过四、五架。这些飞机，在解放军密集高射炮火的阻击下，只能躲在高高的云层之上作漫无目标的投掷。因此，白色的降落伞，黑色的麻袋，连同麻袋中的大米、服装、枪弹甚至整个的肥猪，经常大批地落到解放军阵地上来。据不完全的统计，仅空投大米一项，为解放军收到者即将近三千包。有时降落伞落在两军阵地之间，解放军白天用火力监视，到夜晚便同样成了不要收条的礼物，有些是侥幸地投入了城内的，但因落不到指定地点，也多被饥民抢散或为少数捷足的军官所中饱。什么“擅自抢藏者就地枪决”一类的命令，在这个时候是比平常更不会生效的。长春的国民党军有十万，每人每天以一斤半计算，每天需粮十五万斤。但大型敌机每架至多才载重六千斤，即令全部投中目标，亦属杯水车薪；何况大部收不到手，而阴雨天气更是无法空投呢？特别是最近以来，不知是由于航空人员的贪污还是别的原因，竟投下许多满装砖石的麻袋，甚至有些完全是空的。这便是空投的结果。
    据长春逃兵说：从八月初开始，除新七军三十八师还每周偶而能吃次把少量大米多数大豆的“大米饭”，六十军一八二师尚能勉强维持用三分之一的高粱米作“药引子”搀大豆吃而外，其余四个正规师因为时常领不到军粮，就只好发“粮代金”，拼命去搜刮市民。至于骑兵旅、保安旅等非正规军，则被指定一个地区，抢到什么就吃什么。就这样，长春城内与城郊居民家里仅有的一点食物，便成了匪军任意掠夺的“军粮”，民家的用具、门窗、梁椽，便首先成了他们的燃料。市郊成千幢的房屋被拆毁殆尽了，并已拆向中心区。几十万市民被蒋匪军当着暂时的替死鬼赶到了无以为生的绝境，于是他们便被迫起来同掠夺者作生死的抗争。近来，市民群起抢米、夺枪、捉谍（便衣特务）、扑哨的事件，层出不穷。抢米斗争尤为普遍。成千上万的饥民，每天聚集城郊，等待国民党飞机投下的大米。只要不投在有匪军警卫的固定地点，则大多为饥民一抢而空。一次匪军数辆连粮车经过七马路时，被成群的饥民一拥而上，匪军开枪镇压，死伤数人，但数辆粮车终被抢光。饥民们说：“为什么只许他们（指匪军）抢我们的？反正不抢也是饿死，为什么让我们饿死，让他们活着！？”市民最痛恨的谍报员，时常被打死打伤，或被活捉送给解放军。解放军前线，几乎每天都可以收到长春市民从蒋匪手中夺来的长短枪，总数已达数百支。
    暂时还由反动派统治着的长春，成了这样一个朝不保夕的人间地狱。可是城外不远，便是完全不同的另一个世界。在这里，一望无际的田野上呈现着将近十成的丰收景象。解放军一面肃清长春周围的蒋匪，一面便协助民主政府发动广泛的生产救灾运动，使二十万灾民从死亡的边缘上得到了挽救。从匪占区逃出的难民，纷纷被介绍到安定的后方安家就业。仅是城郊八里堡一地得到解放军与民主政府救济而免于死亡的灾胞，就在一万以上。该地是长春蒋匪军的“抢食区”之一，在蒋匪军“杀民养军”的残暴掠夺之下，曾经出现过卖人肉的市场。长春市民投向解放区者，络绎不绝。单是长春大学师生先后逃至吉林东北大学就教就学者，就有一千多人，曾经受过中美反动派百般欺蒙的长春守军士兵和下级军官们，当他们从耳闻目睹的无数事例，认识到只有投入解放军才是他们的唯一生路，知道解放军确实宽待投诚官兵以后，便也千方百计地寻找机会投奔解放区。据解放军长春前线指挥部统计，自六月二十五日至九月十五日止的八十天中，即收容逃亡蒋军官兵一万五千四百人，达守敌总兵力的百分之十五以上。其中包括校尉级军官约三百名。
    死守长春究竟还有什么希望，连匪首郑洞国也感到极度悲观。据由长春到哈尔滨的长春大学校长张德馨说：有一次，别人问郑对长大迁校有何意见。他苦笑着说：“如果我是长大的校长，我是不主张搬的。长春丢了北平难道还能保吗？在中国，没有一个地方是安全的；要保险，只有迁到美国去。”另一次，几个新闻记者问他：“共产党把长春比成一个大监狱，你有什么意见？”他的回答是：“对啦！我就是监狱长！”现在长春已到了俗语所说“上天无路，入地无门”的境地，除了接受解放军的劝告，早日放下武器而外，这个监狱长和他的狱卒们还有什么地方可以逃生？
    长春已经冷了。冬天对于粮尽援绝、饥寒交迫的敌人是很可怕的。只有投降才是他们自救救人的出路，死守就是守着等死。这一点连郑洞国的妻子和旁的远在数千里外的蒋匪官员们都看得清楚。八月十六日，解放军从蒋机“空投”长春的物品中，缴获了四捆满装着公文、报纸及成千公私信件的邮包。其中有一封是郑洞国的妻子陈×莲（中一字不清）的来信。一开头就是一连串的惊叹号：“你孤守长春已数月，中央竟不体念及此，殊使人心寒！我只求上天保＠你平安！得不着你的一切情形，我真焦急万分！”在所谓“南京总统府”吴椿写给国民党长春市长尚传道的信里，证明尚匪正积极活动浙江省政府委员的位置。信上就：“请陈主席（陈仪）调兄任省委员一事，曾电询卫总司令意见，旋接复电，谓兄任务重要不能离开。政院又以卫总司令未必尽明地方情形，复电询郑主席，尚未得到回电。务请用洽商方式与郑主席恳谈，俾克迅速南下。”原六十军上校参谋长现任职于南京卫戍司令部的冷克，一连写了好几封航空快信给他的上司们。在其给新七军参谋长龙国钧的信中写道：“长沈不好，南京更坏。战事大江南北均难乐观。兖州继开封失守，长市现况无法扭转，一俟季节许可，必将重演吉林覆辙。”但在一封给五十师留守处一位“廖课长”的信中，写信人也说，象以前吉林的敌人逃到长春那样的办法不是办法：“长春很危险，你们怎么办？如队伍往外冲时，千万不可随行，那是很危险的。由长春至沈阳，途中全部是共军，不等到沈，早就垮了；莫如作俘虏好得多。”
