Xinhua News Agency, North Ningqian Front, 18th: Revolutionary order was quickly stabilized in Yixian on the third day after its liberation (October 3rd), and shops and schools in the city resumed business and classes one after another. When the People's Liberation Army entered the county seat, the Urban Work Committee, jointly formed by the main attacking force and local party and government organs, entered the city with the army. After the battle ended, the attacking troops withdrew from the city, and the Urban Work Committee took over the city and announced the implementation of temporary military control in order to quickly establish revolutionary order. The Urban Work Committee was divided into departments such as the Garrison Headquarters, the Civil Affairs Department, the Work Propaganda Team, and the Confiscated Materials Custody and Disposal Committee to carry out tasks such as guarding and defending, establishing order, clearing battle traces, restoring business and schools, and providing comfort and relief. The Urban Work Committee distributed more than 45,000 catties of relief grain to refugees within three days. The Civil Affairs Department specially set up a clinic to treat citizens and wounded enemy officers and soldiers. On the morning of the 2nd, the county government gate was crowded with personnel from the puppet organization who came to register. Shops were busy tidying up their storefronts. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Urban Work Committee announced the lifting of martial law, and the city was taken over by the Yixian Democratic County Government and the City Defense Headquarters. At this point, shops opened for business, and pedestrians were flowing on the streets. On the afternoon of the 4th, male and female students from the city's three middle schools held a joint autumn semester opening ceremony in the county government's auditorium. All students living in the city had arrived, and the principals and faculty of the schools continued to serve. Furthermore, revolutionary order has also been established in Xingcheng. Because the People's Liberation Army strictly observed the entry rules and put out the fires set by the Kuomintang bandit troops that were spreading to civilian houses, the citizens said, "We have never seen such a good army, truly a benevolent and righteous army that does not violate the slightest thing."

　　义县兴城解放后革命秩序已建立
    【新华社北宁前线十八日电】义县解放后的第三天（十月三日）革命秩序即迅速安定，城内商店学校即纷纷复市复课。当解放军攻入县城时，由主攻部队与地方党政机关联合组成的城市工作委员会即随军入城。战斗结束后，攻城部队即撤出城外，城工委员会乃接管该城，宣布实行暂时的军事管制，以便迅速建立革命秩序。城工会下分卫戍司令部、民运部、工作宣传队与缴获物资保管处理委员会等部，进行警戒保卫、建立秩序、清除战迹、复业复学、安抚救济等工作。城工会在三日内给难民发了救济粮四万五千余斤。民运部特设医疗所，为市民及敌方受伤官兵治疗。二日清晨，县府门前挤满了前来登记的伪组织人员。各商店均纷纷整理门面。三日下午，城工会宣布解除戒严，该城由义县民主县政府及城防司令部接管。至此，商店均开门营业，街上行人川流不息。四日下午，该城的三所中学的男女学生，即在县政府的大礼堂举行秋季始业的联合开学典礼。居住城内的学生已全部到济，各校校长及教职员均继续供职。又兴城革命秩序亦已建立。由于解放军严守入城守则，及扑救了国民党匪军纵火延烧的民房，市民们说：“从没有见过这样好的队伍，真是秋毫无犯的仁义之师。”
