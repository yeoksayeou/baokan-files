　　The Capture of Wang Yaowu
    On September 28th, at 8:00 AM, at the Zhang Jian Bridgehead on the Lan River within Shouguang County, north of the Jiaoji Railway, a sentry post of the Shouguang Public Security Bureau detained a "merchant" who was wearing a black old cotton robe, covering his face with a towel, and moaning in a cart. This was Wang Yaowu, Chairman of the Kuomintang Shandong Province, who had fled from Jinan.
    Wang Yaowu disguised himself and abandoned the city of Jinan at 11:00 AM on the 24th. At that time, the People's Liberation Army had surged into the inner city, and shells were continuously exploding around the Beijige (North Pole Pavilion), Wang Yaowu's temporary command post, northeast of Daming Lake. He said despairingly to his chief of staff, Luo Xinli (who has been captured), "I'm leaving; there's no point in staying here. The situation is clear. You all figure out your own ways." After that, he made the excuse of "inspecting the positions" and hurriedly left Beijige. He and his four guards all changed into pre-prepared plainclothes. He wore a Chinese-style jacket and black trousers, carried a cotton quilt, and mingled with the refugees to escape Jinan. Initially, he hired a rickshaw and pretended to be a sick merchant. He stuck a plaster on his leg and wore an old felt hat pulled low over his eyes. Later, he hired two carts, changed clothes again, and simply feigned a serious illness, covering his face with a towel and covering himself with two cotton quilts, lying on the cart and moaning. He and his four guards traveled east along the road north of the Jiaoji Railway, trying to slip through the liberated areas and escape to Qingdao.
    On the morning of the 28th, these two carts reached Zhang Jian Bridgehead and were stopped for inspection by our Public Security Bureau sentries. Wang Yaowu and his guards all said they were from Jinan and were doing business. But their flustered expressions and evasive words could not deceive the alert and responsible sentries. The sentries took them to the Public Security Bureau for separate interrogation. During the questioning, Wang Yaowu tried his best to toss and turn in the cart, and his groans grew louder and louder. When the interrogation officer of our Public Security Bureau approached the cart and asked him questions, he stuck out his tongue to indicate that he was too ill to speak. However, his normal pulse told the truth. The interrogation officer removed the towel and felt hat from his head, revealing a clear black and white mark on his forehead, characteristic of a soldier's hat. So the interrogation officer sternly ordered him to get out of the cart.
    Under strict interrogation, Wang Yaowu still tried to deny his identity. He claimed to be named Qiao Kun, from Linqing, and running a restaurant in Jinan. When asked for the name of the restaurant, he could not answer, saying he "forgot, was confused by the artillery fire." Wang Yaowu called the guards sitting in the same cart with him his "nephews," but when asked what village his nephews were from and what their father's names were, he hesitated and said: "Can't remember which village... um, but it's not far, also from my place. His father's name is... he's a peasant, I'm not very clear what his name is... um, he's called Qiao Kun." Wang Yaowu, "confused by the artillery fire," nonsensically put his own false name on the head of his "nephew's" father.
    During the second interrogation, Wang Yaowu's face was pale, and he looked around at the soldiers escorting him. He begged the interrogator to walk beside him. Upon reaching the interrogation room, he sat down timidly, sighing from time to time and looking around the room. When the interrogation began, he repeatedly asked the interrogation section chief, "Excuse me, are you the county magistrate?" The interrogation section chief ordered him to answer, and he reluctantly said, "Now that it has come to this, let me tell the truth. I am Wang Yaowu." He requested to be sent to the East China Military Region.
    Thus, Wang Yaowu, the lieutenant general commander of the Second Appeasement Zone of the Kuomintang army, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, concurrently the chairman of the puppet Shandong Province and commander of the provincial security forces, became a prisoner of the people. "March into Jinan and capture Wang Yaowu alive!" This loud slogan of the Shandong people has been gloriously realized.

　　活捉王耀武经过
    九月二十八日上午八时，在胶济路北侧寿光县境内澜河上的张剑桥桥头，我寿光公安局盘查哨扣留了一个穿着黑色旧棉袍，用毛巾蒙着脸，躲在一辆大车上呻吟的“商人”。这就是从济南逃出来的国民党山东省主席王耀武。
    王耀武是二十四日上午十一时从济南化装弃城逃跑的；当时，人民解放军已汹涌攻入内城，炮弹连续爆炸在大明湖东北的北极阁——王耀武的临时指挥所的周围。他绝望地向他的参谋长罗辛理（按已被俘）说：“我走了，留在这里没有好处。事情是很明白的，你们也各自想办法吧。”之后他就以“巡视阵地”作借口仓皇地走出北极阁，和他的四个卫士都换了预先准备好的便衣。他穿着对襟夹袄和黑色单裤，扛一个棉被卷，混在难民群里逃出了济南。起初，他雇一辆小车，自己装作一个有病的商人。腿上贴了张膏药，破旧呢帽低低地罩着眼睛。后来他又雇了两辆大车，另换衣服，索性假装重病，用手巾蒙上脸，盖上两床棉被，躺在大车上呻吟。他和他的四个卫士一起，就这样地沿着胶济铁路北侧的大路东行，企图混过解放区内地逃到青岛去。
    廿八日晨，这两辆大车行至张剑桥头，被我公安局哨兵拦住盘查。王耀武和他的卫士都说自己是济南人，做买卖的。但他们的仓皇失措的神情和支吾的言语，瞒不住机敏负责的哨兵。哨兵就把他们带到公安局去分别审讯。盘问时王耀武在车上竭力辗转反侧，哼声越来越大。我公安局审讯干事走近车旁问他时，他伸出舌头表示病得不能说话。但是，他的和常人一样的脉搏却说了真话。审讯干事除下他头上的毛巾和呢帽，露出额上一条黑白分明的军人特有的帽印。于是审讯干事厉声命令他下车。
    在严格审问中，王耀武仍图抵赖。他自称名叫乔坤，是临清人，在济南开菜馆的，问他菜馆字号，他却答不上来，说是“忘记了，给大炮吓糊涂了”。王耀武把和他坐在一辆车上的卫士称做是他的“侄子”，但问他侄子是什么村人，侄子的父亲叫什么时，他吞吞吐吐地说：“想不清他是什么村………唔，可是不远，也是俺那地方人。他父亲名字是…………他是个庄户人，我还不大清楚叫什么…………唔，他叫乔坤。”“吓糊涂了”的王耀武，把他自己的假名牛头不对马嘴地又安到了他的“侄子”的父亲头上了。
    第二次提审时，王耀武面色苍白，左顾右盼地望着押解他的几个战士。他恳求提审员与他并肩走。到受审室，他畏缩地坐下来，时而叹息，时而向屋子周围张望。审讯开始时，他连声问审讯股长，“请问，你是不是县长？”审讯股长命令他答话，他才无可如何地，缓慢地说：“已经到了这步田地，让我说实话吧。我就是王耀武。”他请求把他送到华东军区。
    这个国民党军第二绥区中将司令官、国民党中央执行委员，兼伪山东省主席、省保安司令王耀武，就这样作了人民的俘虏。“打进济南府，活捉王耀武！”这一山东人民的响亮口号光辉地实现了。（新华社华东电）
