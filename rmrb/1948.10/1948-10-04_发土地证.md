    　　　　Scene 1
    Old Man: (Entering, carrying a sickle and a carrying pole) I, old man, am called Qingyuan, and the bitter water of the past is endless to spit out. Stepping on other people's land, with other people's sky above my head, working as a hired laborer, farming rented land, unable to pay the rent and burdened with interest, every drop of sweat shattered into eight pieces, and I never saw grain year after year. Working hard, slowly and exerting all my strength, I still couldn't avoid suffering and hardship. I always thought I would never escape the poor man's pit in my life, but who would have thought that the Communist Party came and the world changed, reducing rents and increasing wages, slowly eating my fill of gruel; I have permanent tenancy rights to the land I cultivate, and priority to buy land, I tightened my belt and grit my teeth, saving four shih of millet, and bought the six mu of rented land, now I have my own land, and getting the red deed is even happier than marrying a wife and riding in a sedan chair. Last winter, there was land reform, and I also participated in the poor peasant association, and this year I was allocated three mu of land, one mu of garden and two mu of dry land, with houses, land, food and clothing, the days ahead will not be difficult. To live well, rely on production! Get up early and work late! You have to exchange sweat for food. All the work in the fields is done, cutting grass and pressing fertilizer to pad the pigsty, I am not afraid of hard work, but there is one thing that bothers me: I want to compost more manure, but I am afraid that the land will not belong to me next year, so I can only plant for one season at a time, and live one day at a time. I ate breakfast and went to the south mountain, I was walking slowly because I had something on my mind. (Exits) (Loafer enters, tipsy, carrying half a bottle of wine.)
    Loafer: I, Taoqi, am a loafer, I want money for food and drink but I don't work properly, my parents died early, and I've squandered my share of the family property, resting in the east cool spot and resting in the west cool spot, avoiding production by hook or by crook, the cadres have also tried to persuade me, telling me to produce and change quickly, hum! Whether I change or not is none of their business, anyway, I breathe evenly when I rest, and producing means more sweat. I've spent all the grain and loans I borrowed, and it's hard to get me to produce. I love to see struggles and liquidations, in the winter year after year there is equal division, and I also participate in the poor peasant association, checking class status, distributing land, and doing all kinds of work happily. When distributing the fruits of victory, I want double the price, and I have to pick the best ones first. I wanted a good four mu of land, with wheat seedlings on one and a half mu, I was allocated three dou and two sheng of millet, and two dou and a half of wheat. I use the wheat to make white flour, make pancakes, fried eggs, mutton dumplings dipped in spicy garlic, and millet can also be exchanged for sesame cakes, I can eat without using a stove, I eat and drink without producing, and after eating and drinking, I liquidate again, if land reform happens once a year, I won't have to worry about eating or wearing clothes. I just drank half a catty of wine, and I feel weak and dizzy all over, the sky is spinning, the earth is spinning, I'm floating to the west, I'm going home on a plane, (Old Man enters slowly, the two bump into each other) What is this that tripped me!?
    Old Man: Walking and bumping into people, are your eyes on your backside! Your face is red like a groundhog's eye, where did you get drunk again!
    Loafer: (Smiling obsequiously) I'm hungry if I don't drink for three days, I drank four liang in the small wine shop, I still have half a catty of wine here, Brother Qingyuan, have a taste.
    Old Man: Taoqi, don't be ridiculous, you're old, you're not small, you should learn to be good in the future. If you have nothing to do after eating, you should go to the fields and take a look. Look at the four mu of land you planted, how can you tell the grass from the seedlings!? You don't hoe or water, what will you do when you are hungry in the winter!?
    Loafer: Brother Qingyuan, listen to me, what's wrong with eating and drinking a little! Once a year there's an equal division, twice a year there's a reform, every year we divide the fruits of victory, we poor peasants should gather our strength, and wait until autumn to tidy up (Staggers off).
    Old Man: (Watching Taoqi leave, angrily) Thief Taoqi, rogue! You're no good! If everyone learns from you and doesn't produce, what will you tidy up in the autumn! Hey, why bother to get angry with him, I'd better go up the mountain to cut grass. (Takes two steps, stops) As I walk, I think, and think and think but have no idea, if the land still changes in the autumn, who am I busy cutting grass and putting on manure for! I might as well rest, I can't be bothered, I might as well go home and lie on the kang (Returns and exits).
    Wife: (Enters) I, wife, am fifty-one, my husband's surname is Zhang and my surname is Li. In the past, we were suffering people, but this year we have houses and land, enough to eat, drink and grow, how can the wife not be happy. In July, the weather is good, my husband gets up early and works late, working hard in the fields, Shuanchu goes to school every day, and I cook, spin, feed the pigs and chickens at home. After eating breakfast and washing the dishes, I move out the spinning wheel to spin, hey, why isn't he producing, drooping his head and going home? (Old Man enters)
    Old Man: Going home, I don't work, I'll sit on the kang.
    Wife: After the autumn equinox, it's a busy time, every household is busy producing, why are you resting and hiding at home being lazy? This year we were allocated good irrigated land, it will be a joke if we don't grow well.
    Old Man: Hey! Who is being cunning, who is being lazy, who says I'm being lazy at home? What kind of work do you say I haven't done!?
    Wife: (White) Did you water the eggplants and peppers?
    Old Man: (White) I watered them!
    Wife: (White) Did you plant the cabbage and radishes?
    Old Man: (White) I planted them!
    Wife: (White) Did you hoe the buckwheat?
    Old Man: (White) I hoed it long ago! (Continues in allegro rhythm) Wife, stop bothering me, you go to the fields and take a look: the cotton is topped, the yam vines are turned, the corn has passed the ridge, and the millet has been hoeed three times, what kind of work in the fields do you say I haven't done! In the past, you women had bound feet, you could bind and bind and never finish binding? Hey, I'll hang up the hoe and rest for two days, just waiting for the autumn harvest to open the sickle.
    Wife: Old man, you listen, planting depends entirely on diligence, when all the work in the fields is done, carry a manure basket to pick up manure.
    Old Man: I, I don't know what's the use of picking that!
    Wife: Look at you, you confused old fool, the older you get, the more dead your brain becomes, as the saying goes: clumsy work is better than putting on manure, planting without manure is like mixing things up blindly.
    Old Man: You're so clever, you're so capable, I don't understand these things! …Alas! (Walks aside worriedly)
    Wife: This year there is a lot of rain and the land is shady, it's a good time to plant more wheat, if you don't cut grass and put on manure, how will you supply it?
    Old Man: Plant more wheat, put on more manure, you're dreaming during the day! This year we got a few mu of land, who knows who will be planting it next year? There's no accurate rules right now, three years for a review, two years for an equal division, there will be struggles every year, what's the use of planting wheat and putting on manure!
    Wife: I don't believe this, didn't people say they were going to issue… land certificates?
    Old Man: Land certificates, land certificates, there's no movement after one or two times, how can I be at ease with worry!
    Wife: (Anxiously) This is unacceptable, if you don't plant wheat and put on manure, you won't have anything to eat between the green and yellow seasons, how can you live on an empty stomach? (Loafer enters with a dustpan).
    Loafer: I divided up all the fruits of victory, and ate two or three in a row, leaving half a sheng of millet, and I exchanged it for liquor in the morning, I went home to cook, and swept all the jars and urns, there's not a grain of food, only two sheng of poor quality sorghum, half of which are rat droppings. The sesame candy basket is not on credit, the sesame cake shop wants cash, my stomach is growling with hunger, and I stare blankly without tickets. The lazier I am, the more gluttonous I become, I just want rice and white flour, I've borrowed from all the neighbors, this one snarls, that one glares, they all say they have plenty of grain, feeding pigs and dogs but not giving it to loafers. You sons of bitches, don't glare, just wait and see this autumn, I'll classify you all as rich peasants, and settle accounts with you one by one. Hey, Qingyuan is honest and kind, I'll go to his house to borrow white flour. (Enters) Entering the door, I look around, both of them are in the courtyard, I open my mouth with a smile, Brother and Sister Qingyuan, listen to me, we have guests at home today, and I didn't get around to grinding white flour, can you lend me two sheng of flour to help my brother out of trouble.
    Old Man: You had money to drink wine this morning, but now you don't have money to buy white flour?
    Wife: Taoqi, you see clearly, we don't have the life to enjoy, we don't have a white flour mouth, you go and ask someone else!
    Loafer: Sister-in-law Qingyuan, show some kindness, if you don't have two sheng, lend me one sheng.
    Wife: (White) Not even one sheng!
    Loafer: (Pleading) Then lend me half a sheng.
    Wife: (Firmly) Not even half a sheng!
    Loafer: A tree needs bark, and a person needs face, don't be so short-sighted, sister-in-law, I'm not cheating or swindling, I'll borrow it today and return it tomorrow. Seeing that there will be another liquidation after autumn, the fruits of victory are waiting for us, are you afraid that I won't be able to repay your two sheng of flour?
    Wife: After the wheat harvest and before the autumn harvest, these days are difficult, we harvested two dou of wheat in the summer, and ate it all in three or eight days, listen to the piglets crying with hunger, if we feed the piglets well, they can trample the threshing floor. (Exits)
    Loafer: (Extremely angry and helpless, to himself) Alas! Really unlucky, really disappointing, even dung beetles sting people today. (To Qingyuan) Brother Qingyuan, you don't know, it's bustling on the street, everyone is saying that our village's equal division is not thorough, and there will be a general equal division in the autumn. The whole village's land is averaged, and all the grain and clothes belong to the public, the district chief came to our village at night, just for this matter.
    Old Man: (White) Is this true?
    Loafer: I saw it clearly, the district chief went to the township director. The Communist Party loves the poor, it's glorious to eat and drink everything, let's prepare early, so we can divide the fruits in the autumn.
    Old Man: (Uneasily) Alas! People can be lazy or diligent, it's hard to say there will be a general equal division then. If we keep doing this over and over again, who will have the heart to live? Hey! Shuanchu's mother went to get white flour, let's be ruthless and eat a meal of it.
    Wife: (Enters) Old man, are you crazy, you're not working and you've stopped working, and you want to eat white flour, don't you want to live?
    Cadre: (Entering happily) Aunt Qingyuan, Uncle Qingyuan, hurry up and go to the meeting!
    Wife: What's all the shouting and screaming about, what's the big deal?
    Cadre: You'll know when you get there and listen, I guarantee it will make you laugh out loud.
    Old Man: I have things to do at your meeting, I don't have time today.
    Cadre: Uncle Qingyuan, listen clearly, this is different from the old days. People from the district came at night, to issue us land certificates.
    All Three: To issue us land certificates?
    Cadre: Oh! Our village's land reform is complete, the land allocation is settled, we will issue you land certificates, from now on it will not change, to determine individual ownership, and everything from tenancy to sales will be allowed.
    Loafer: After hearing this, Taoqi is both angry and happy, angry that I can't liquidate anymore, and happy that I can handle the land as I please. I'll sell two mu of land first, and buy a few dou of wheat and rice. Hey, a person shouldn't die if they still have a chance to be saved, I hurry… (Exits)
    Wife: (Happily) Oh my! This is really like a heavy rain in a drought, the Communist Party has really touched our hearts. The old man was worried about this just now, but now the big problem is solved. Let's go, let's go, let's go and get it!
    Old Man: Yes, yes, yes, let's go and get it!
    Cadre: Hey, walk slowly, don't worry, look how happy you two are! We're not getting land certificates today, we're going to the farmers' association to register first, how many rooms, how many mu of land, register the men and women.
    Wife: This is easy to register, we won't conceal anything, we'll report according to reality, I'm fifty-one this year, your uncle is fifty-seven this year, Shuanchu is just eleven this year, and goes to school every morning, we have a three-legged donkey, one pig and three chickens.
    Old Man: Hey, old woman, don't talk nonsense, they're asking you how many people there are, and you're talking about your pigs and chickens, (Anxiously asks) Shandang, I ask you, will the newly distributed land be counted as ours this time when we register the land?
    Cadre: The newly distributed land, the old bought land, all the land is registered; is it irrigated land, is it dry land, how many mu and fen and li; in front of the road, behind the ditch, who are your neighbors? Report the four boundaries clearly, write them down carefully piece by piece; and there is one more thing to pay attention to, honestly report the hidden land. If you don't register now, we won't be polite if we find out later.
    Old Man: Our few mu are clear, I guarantee there's no hidden land.
    Wife: Stop arguing, old man, let's go register… (All three exit)
    　　　　Scene 2
    (Backstage, a loudspeaker on the roof announces: "Our village's land and houses have been registered, there will be a general meeting today, and the district chief will personally issue us land certificates, everyone bring your old documents and gather quickly!")
    (Old Man enters carrying a red deed)
    Old Man: Old red deed, old red deed, fifty years of suffering all for you, today I have to hand you over, and I'm a little reluctant in my heart, in case there are problems in the future, you are my old proof; should I hand you over or not, I think and think but have no idea.
    Cadre: (Enters) Uncle Qingyuan, what are you doing? Everyone in our group has arrived, we're just short of you when we count the numbers.
    Old Man: (Puts the red deed away) I… look, it's terrible, I can't find my red deed.
    Cadre: Ah, the old red deed, you can't lose it, hurry up and look for it in the house, take the old deed to exchange for the new deed, to avoid problems in the future.
    Wife: (Enters) Shuanchu's father, you old thing, where are you hiding? Everyone is going to get their land certificates, and you're dawdling like a big slowpoke.
    Cadre: You can't find your red deed, go and help him look for it.
    Wife: Ah, the old documents, the old red deed, I prepared them at night, wrapped in your wallet, where could you have lost them? Take out your wallet and take a look, you old thing, you're really hopeless!
    Old Man: (Speechless)
    Wife: (Already understands) Hey, old thing, confused old fool, you haven't figured things out yet, you're still obsessed with the old red deed, and you're still afraid that the land certificate won't work? Think about it, twenty years ago, the landlords and despots occupied our three mu of land, we had documents but they had money, you lost the lawsuit and went to jail, that world belonged to the rich, you had proof but you still didn't get anything. (Old Man nods)
    Cadre: Now that we have issued land certificates, the government is in charge and the foundation is strong, everyone can rest assured and produce, and there is a guarantee for getting rich.
    Old Man: I, Qingyuan, sold so much labor to buy these three mu of land! You were the landlord's knife handle, forcing me to pay rent and take interest, I… I get more and more angry as I talk, I wish I could tear you up!
    Wife: Old man, don't worry, take it to the meeting, and everyone will burn it together, burn the old deed and exchange it for the new deed.
    Cadre: Let's go, let's go, let's hurry up! (All three exit) (Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, the Old Man enters happily)
    Old Man: The sun is shining brightly in the sky, and it's bustling under the stage, like a wedding or a happy event, everyone is happy. The district chief's speech is really good, he says it clearly, this time we're issuing land certificates, and the land won't change anymore. No liquidation, no struggle, our superiors guarantee it. Renting out land, hiring laborers, free buying and selling are all allowed. Loafers who don't produce will not be issued land certificates for the time being. He calls on us to buy livestock, exchange labor, organize ourselves and work more, accumulate more fertilizer, put on more manure, and get rich. Every sentence touches my heart, he is a confidant of our people. Land is liberated and turned over, old documents and old deeds are useless. Let's light a fire and burn them all, like sweeping away feudal exploitation. (Wife enters)
    Wife: Old man, you listen, I'm going to criticize you, you didn't want the land that was left over in the spring, I told you to take more but you wouldn't, now everyone is rushing to take it, you can't have it even if you want it.
    Old Man: Wife, listen to me, we can't be selfish and self-interested, three of us have nine mu of land, it's just right.
    Wife: Humph! Now we only have half, what will we do if we have a child?
    Old Man: (Jokingly) Wife, you're fifty-one, do you still want to have a boy or a girl?
    Wife: Old thing, damn you, I'm talking about our Shuanchu, he'll get married in ten years, and we'll have a fair and fat little boy, where are we going to get a few mu of land then?
    Old Man: Five years, ten years, twenty years, our family will get better day by day, we won't have to worry about land by reclaiming wasteland and repairing beaches, cattle and sheep will be in herds and donkeys will be everywhere, then we will have a good time too!
    (From inside, someone shouts: "Zhang Qingyuan, Li Laogui, come and get your land certificates!")
    Old Man: Suddenly I heard a shout from the school, hurry up and get my land certificate.
    Wife: Old man, wait a minute, I think I should go get it, you're stubborn and clumsy, and you can't even make a correct fingerprint.
    Old Man: Forget it, stop bothering me, how can women do this? You don't even have a big name, go home and cook as soon as possible.
    Wife: Old thing, you're shameless, you can't look down on women. I also have a share in the land, it won't be settled if I don't go.
    Old Man: Okay, okay, don't shout, write both names, let's go together to get it, men and women are equal. (Both exit) (Loafer enters)
    Loafer: Taoqi is out of luck, everyone is pushing me down, everyone is making suggestions, everyone is against me, saying that I am a lazy loafer, and that I am habitually lazy and don't produce, they won't issue me a land certificate, I only have the right to use it, I can't pawn it, I can't sell it, this makes me look like a fool. I… I have a thick skin and a smooth tongue, I'll talk about it again shamelessly, as long as I get the land certificate, everything from tenancy to sales will be up to me. (Old Man and Wife enter happily with land certificates)
    Old Man: The land certificate is really good-looking, with a bright red official seal in the middle, now that I have land and houses, I can work hard and produce.
    Wife: The land certificate is square, with black words written on white paper. My family property is guaranteed, how can the wife not be happy.
    Loafer: Going up and calling Brother Qingyuan, we're on good terms, please say good things for me, issue me a land certificate, and I will definitely change my ways from now on.
    Old Man: (Sarcastically) Oh, issue the land certificate, sell the land quickly and exchange it for sesame cakes. Hey! Two years for a liquidation, one year for an equal division, you can't eat up the fruits of victory, what land certificate do you want?
    Loafer: (Goes to the Wife again) Sister-in-law Qingyuan, listen to me, I, Taoqi, will change in the future, if you issue me a land certificate, I will definitely produce well.
    Wife: Humph! A dog will eat shit even if you beat it a thousand times, it's hard to change if you're habitually lazy. You're like Wu Dalang sitting on the throne, no one dares to insure you. Hey! Old man, give me that land certificate, I'll take a good look at it again, the land is reunited with the family, I, the wife, like it more and more as I look at it. (Deliberately teasing Taoqi)
    Cadre: (Enters) Hey! Look at this old couple, they're so happy they don't know east from west.
    Loafer: (Steps forward to plead) Shandang, good brother, I admitted my mistakes at the meeting, I've figured out my thinking, issue me a land certificate today, and I will definitely produce and work hard. My life is too difficult now, please take care of me.
    Cadre: Taoqi, listen clearly, don't be a rogue here. You've been dividing land every year for the past two years, and you've either lost it or sold it, you've taken advantage and you're still acting good, this trick won't work anymore. Let me tell you, all the tricks are useless, go and work honestly, as long as you can really change, we'll give you a land certificate later, if you're still lazy and don't produce, we won't let you plant these four mu of land either. (Taoqi lowers his head)
    Wife: Shandang, read the land certificate to us, so your aunt can hear it again. (All three look at it)
    Loafer: (Heart is painful, internal struggle) Alas! Punching the skin hurts, talking hurts the bones. It's sad to say in my heart, the loafer's road doesn't work. Relying on liquidation, relying on struggle, the fruits of victory can't be eaten. Selling houses and selling land doesn't work, flies eat farts and it's all for nothing. There's only one road ahead, go to the field and produce. Gritting my teeth, I'll be ruthless, I'm still a young man, I'll work hard from now on, I don't believe I'm worse than others. Alas! No one believes what I'm saying, I can only hate myself, I haven't shed a tear in decades, but tears are rolling down my face today.
    Wife: (After looking at the land certificate, smiles) Written well, written clearly, old man, you can rest assured, let's cut more grass and compost more manure, just waiting to plant wheat in the autumn.
    Old Man: Yes! Plant more wheat, put on more manure, I'll also organize labor exchange teams, from now on the land won't change, and we can live in peace. (Both laugh, Taoqi cries quietly to the side)
    Cadre: Taoqi, what's wrong, what's on your mind, tell us.
    Loafer: (Ashamed) Taoqi is ashamed today, he lowers his head without saying a word, a person needs face, a tree needs bark, Taoqi, I will definitely fight for it, if I'm a loafer and don't produce again, I'll be a son of a bitch!
    All: (Laugh) Good, a prodigal son returns and is worth more than gold, we all like it. As long as you are determined to change, we will give you ownership later.
    Old Man: Let's organize a labor exchange team and help each other exchange labor.
    All: (Together) Today we issue land certificates, work hard and produce, women should also go to the fields, loafers are determined to change, work hard in unity and produce, and get rich for ten thousand years. (The End)

    时间——一九四八年秋
    地点——土改结束的老区某村
    人物——老汉、老婆、干部、懒汉
    　　　　第一场
    老汉：（拿着镰刀、扁担走上）我老汉，叫庆元，过去的苦水吐不完。脚踏人家地，头顶人家天，当找工，种租地，交不起租子扛利钱，一颗汗珠摔八瓣，年年粮食不见面。紧干慢干使劲干，免不了受罪又遭难。我只说咱一辈子跳不出穷人坑，谁料想，共产党一来世道变，减租子，长工钱，慢慢吃饱了糊糊饭；种地咱有永佃权，买地咱有优先权，我勒紧腰带咬牙干，攒下小米整四石，买下那六亩租子地，从今有了自己的田，红契文书拿到手，真比那娶媳妇坐轿还喜欢。去年冬天闹土改，咱也参加了贫农团，今年又分给咱三亩地，一亩园子二亩旱，有房有地有吃穿，以后的日子就不困难。过光景，靠生产！搭早起，恋黑干！要吃饱饭汗珠换。地里活儿都干完，割草压肥垫猪圈，卖劲受苦咱不怕，有件心事不耐烦：有心多沤几圈粪，又怕明年土地不归咱，只得种了一季说一季，过了一天说一天。吃过早饭上南山，心里有事走的慢。（下）（懒汉醉薰薰的，提着半瓶酒上。）
    懒汉：我淘气，是懒汉，吃喝要钱不正干，父母爹娘下世早，一份家业踢踏完，东凉里歇到西凉里，拐弯抹角不生产，干部也曾把我劝，叫我生产快转变，哼！转变不转变，不用他们管，反正歇着出气匀，生产就得多流汗。贷粮贷款我全化完，想叫我生产难上难。闹斗争，闹清算，这些事情我爱见，年上冬天闹平分，我也参加了贫农团，查阶级，分土地，样样工作干的欢。分配果实要双价，我得先把好的拣。要了好地四亩整，带着麦苗一亩半，分了小米三斗二，分了麦子二斗半。有了麦子推白面，烙大饼、炒鸡蛋、羊肉饺子蘸辣蒜，小米也能换烧饼，不动烟火也吃饭，我大吃大喝不生产，吃喝完了再清算，土改要一年来一回，我就不愁吃来不愁穿。刚才喝了半斤酒，浑身没劲又头旋，天也转，地也转，腾云架雾上西天，我坐着飞机回家转，（老汉低头上，二人撞着）什么东西把我绊！？
    老汉：走道往人身上撞，你眼睛长到屁股上！你脸象地皮眼发红，又到那里发酒疯！
    懒汉：（嬉皮笑脸的）三天不喝馋的慌，小酒铺里喝了四两，这里还有半斤酒，庆元大哥你尝一尝。
    老汉：叫声淘气别胡闹，你年纪大，个不小，以后也该学学好。吃了没事闲的慌，你也到地里瞧一瞧。看你养种的那四亩地，那能分出草和苗！？又不锄，又不浇，冬天挨饿怎么着！？
    懒汉：庆元哥，听我说，吃点喝点怕什么！一年一平分，二年一改革，年年都分胜利果，咱贫雇农攒好劲，但等秋后再拾掇（踉踉跄跄下）。
    老汉：（目视淘气下，气愤的）贼淘气，无赖皮！正经不是好东西！都学你胡糟不生产，叫你秋后拾掇个屁！哎，何必和他生闲气，我赶紧上山割草去。（走两步、停下）一边走，一边想，左思右想没主张，秋后土地还变动，割草上粪为谁忙！还是歇歇不使的慌，不如回家上炕躺一躺（返回下）。
    老婆：（上）我老婆，五十一，老头子姓张我姓李。过去咱是受苦人，今年有房又有地，够吃够喝够养种，怎不叫老婆心欢喜。七月里，好天气，老头子恋黑搭早起，下地干活一百一，拴柱天天去上学，我在家里做饭、纺线、喂猪又喂鸡。吃过早饭刷了碗，搬出纺车来纺纺线，哎，他爹怎么不生产，搭拉着脑袋回家转？（老汉上）
    老汉：回家转，我不干活，炕头上，我坐一坐。
    老婆：立了秋，大忙天，家家户户忙生产，怎么你倒歇了工，躲在家里当懒汉？今年咱分了好水地，养种不好人家笑话咱。
    老汉：哎！谁撒奸，谁偷懒，谁说我在家当懒汉？你说什么活儿我不干！？
    老婆：（白）那茄子、辣椒你浇了？
    老汉：（白）浇啦！
    老婆：（白）白菜萝卜种上啦？
    老汉：（白）种上啦！
    老婆：（白）荞麦锄了？
    老汉：（白）早就锄了！（接说快板）老婆子，少麻烦，你到地里看一看：棉花掐了尖，山药翻了蔓，玉角过了垅，谷子锄三遍，你说地里活，那样没干完！当你们妇女臭裹脚，可缠可缠缠不完？哎，挂了锄我歇两天，单等收秋再开镰。
    老婆：老头子你是听，种地全凭要勤谨，地里活儿全干完，背上粪筐去拾粪。
    老汉：我，我不知道拾那有啥用！
    老婆：你看你这糊涂虫，越活越老死脑筋，常言说：巧做不如拙上粪，种地不上粪，就等于瞎胡混。
    老汉：数你精，数你能，这些事情我不懂！……唉！（发愁的走到一边）
    老婆：今年雨多地皮阴，正好多把麦子种，不割草，不上粪，供应不上怎么行？
    老汉：多种麦，多上粪，你白天睡觉做大梦！今年咱得了几亩地，谁知明年叫谁种？这会儿没个准章程，三年一复查，二年一平分，年年都得闹斗争，种麦上粪有什么用！
    老婆：这个话，我不信，人家不说要发什么……土地证？
    老汉：土地证，土地证，一回两回没动静，提心吊胆怎么能安生！
    老婆：（着急）这个事，怎么行，不种麦子不上粪，青黄不接吃不上，饿着肚子怎么成？（懒汉拿着簸箕上）。
    懒汉：胜利果实分的全，我一溜二三吃了个干，剩下小米二升半，早上又把烧酒换，回到家里去做饭，缸缸瓮瓮都扫遍，粮食没有一点点，就有二升秕高粱，老鼠巴巴有一半。麻糖篮子不赊帐，烧饼铺里要现钱，肚子饿的咕咕叫，没有票子干瞪眼。我人越懒嘴越馋，光想大米和白面，左邻右舍都借遍，这家眦眦牙，那家瞪瞪眼，都说粮食有的是，喂猪喂狗不给懒汉。狗日的们别瞪眼，单等今年秋后看，都把你们划成富农，一个一个来清算。哎，庆元老实心眼软，我到他家借白面。（进门）进了门，用目观，两人都在正当院，我满脸带笑开了口，大哥大嫂听我言，家里今天来了客，没有顾上推白面，你们有面借二升，帮助兄弟解困难。
    老汉：早上你有钱打酒喝，这会就没钱称白面？
    老婆：叫淘气你看的清，咱就没有享福的命，咱没长着白面嘴，你快到别人家问一问！
    懒汉：庆元嫂子发善心，没有二升借一升。
    老婆：（白）一升也没有！
    懒汉：（乞怜）那借半升。
    老婆：（坚决的）半升也没有！
    懒汉：树要皮，人要脸，大嫂行事别太短，我不是崩，不是骗，今儿个借了明儿个还。眼看秋后又清算，胜利果实等着咱，你怕还不起你二升面？
    老婆：麦夏后，秋收前，这会日子正困难，夏天打了二斗麦，三八两天早吃完，你听那小猪饿的直叫唤，喂好猪子能踩圈。（下）
    懒汉：（气极，又无法，自语）唉！真倒霉，真背兴，屎螳螂今天也螫人。（向庆元）庆元哥，你不知情，大街之上闹烘烘，都说咱村平分不彻底，秋后要闹个一般平。全村土地大平均，粮食衣裳全归公，夜里区长到咱村，就是为了这事情。
    老汉：（白）这是真的？
    懒汉：这个事我看的清，区长去找乡主任。共产党，爱穷人，吃光喝光穷光荣，咱们早早做准备，秋后好把果实分。
    老汉：（不安地）唉！为人有懒有勤谨，那时也难说一般平。老这么一回一回的闹，谁还有心过光景？哎！拴柱他娘去赶白面，咱也狠心吃一顿。
    老婆：（上）老头子，你发了疯，不干营生你放了工，又要赶着吃白面，你就不想过光景？
    干部：（高兴的喝着上）庆元婶子庆元叔，快快开会快快走！
    老婆：呜呼呐喊吓死人，又有什么大事情？
    干部：到那一听就知道，保险叫你哈哈笑。
    老汉：你们开会我有事儿，今天我可没工夫儿。
    干部：庆元叔，听分明，这和往日大不同。夜里区上来了人，要给咱发土地证。
    三人同：要给咱发土地证？
    干部：噢！咱村土改已完成，土地分配算一定，给咱们发下土地证，从今以后不再动，确定个人所有权，佃当买卖全都行。
    懒汉：淘气我听罢这一句，又是恼来又是喜，恼的是以后不能再清算，喜的是土地随便能处理。回去我先卖二亩地，买几斗麦子和大米。哎，人不该死总有救，我赶紧……（下）
    老婆：（高兴的）啊呀呀呀！这真是，大旱年月下透雨，共产党真是摸到咱心眼里。为这事，他爹刚才还着急，这下解决了大问题。走，走，咱快领去！
    老汉：对，对，对，咱快领去！
    干部：哎，慢慢走，别着急，看把你俩高兴的！今个不领土地证，先到农会去登记，几间房，几亩地，男女人口登记齐。
    老婆：这个事，好登记，咱不包不瞒按实际，我今年五十一，你叔今年五十七，拴柱今年刚十一，每天清早上学去，毛驴俺有一条腿，一个猪三只鸡。
    老汉：哎，老东西，瞎唧唧，人家问你人几口，你就说你那猪和鸡，（关切的问）叫山堂，我问你，这会土地作登记？新分的土地算不算自己的？
    干部：新分的，旧买的，一切的土地全登记；是水地，是旱地，几亩几分又几厘；前靠道，后傍渠，你和谁家打邻居？四至分明报清楚，一块一块写仔细；还有件事要注意，老老实实报黑地。这会要是不登记，再查出来不客气。
    老汉：咱这几亩是明的，保险没有瞒黑地。
    老婆：别罗嗦了，老东西，走咱赶紧去登记…………（三人下）
    　　　　第二场
    （后台屋顶广播声：“咱村土地房屋登记完了，今天开大会，区长亲自给咱发土地证，大家拿着旧文书，赶紧集合了！”）
    （老汉拿着一张红契上）
    老汉：老红契，老红契，五十年受苦都为你，今天要把你交出去，心眼里有点舍不的，万一以后要出问题，你是我的老凭据；交好还是不交好，左思右想无主意。
    干部：（上）庆元叔，干么哩？咱们这组里全到了，点点人数就短你。
    老汉：（把红契装起来）我………你看看，真糟糕，我的红契找不着。
    干部：啊，老红契，可丢不的，赶紧屋里找找去，拿上旧契换新契，免得以后出问题。
    老婆：（上）拴柱他爹你老东西，你藏到那个窟窿哩？人家都去领土地证，你磨磨蹭蹭象个大笨蛆。
    干部：你们那红契找不着，你快去帮助找一找。
    老婆：啊，旧文书，老红契，夜里黑家就预备起，包在你那钱包里，还能丢到那里去？拿出钱包看一看，你个老东西，真是没出息！
    老汉：（无言答对）
    老婆：（已看出）哎，老东西，糊涂虫，你那思想还没搞通，你还迷着老红契，还怕土地证不中用？你想想，二十年前，地主恶霸占咱三亩田，咱有文书人家有钱，你输了官司还坐监，那世界是人家财主的，你有凭有据也不沾。（老汉点头）
    干部：如今发下土地证，政府作主根子硬，大伙安心闹生产，发家致富有保证。
    老汉：（拿出红契）我庆元为买你这三亩地，卖了多少苦力气！你是财主刀把子，逼着我交租拿利息，我………我越说越有气，狠不的一下撕了你！
    老婆：老头子，别着急，把它带到会场里，大伙一齐把它烧，烧了老契换新契。
    干部：走，走，咱赶快去！（三人下）（锣鼓声中，老汉高兴的上）
    老汉：天上日头明又明，戏楼底下闹烘烘，好象娶亲过喜事，一个一个都高兴。区长讲话真好听，一句一句讲的清，这回发下土地证，土地以后不再动。不清算，不斗争，有咱上级作保证。出租地，雇长工，自由买卖也都行。二流子懒汉不生产，暂且不发土地证。他号召咱们买牲口，拨换工，组织起来多劳动，多积肥，多上粪，发家致富过光景。句句说到我心眼上，他是咱百姓知心的人。土地解放大翻身，旧文书旧契不顶用。一块点火把它烧，好象那封建剥削一扫清。（老婆上）
    老婆：老头子，你是听，我可要把你来批评，春上剩的地没人要，我叫你多要你不肯，如今人家都抢着要，你想再要也不行。
    老汉：老婆子，听我的，不能自私和自利，咱三口人九亩地，不多不少就可以。
    老婆：哼！如今咱只一半，添个孩子怎么办？
    老汉：（开玩笑）老婆子，你五十一，你还想养男生女？
    老婆：老东西，该死的，我是说咱拴柱儿，再过十年娶媳妇儿，抱个又白又胖的小小子儿，到那去要几亩地儿？
    老汉：五年十年二十年，咱家景一天好一天，开荒修滩不愁地，牛羊成群驴满圈，那时候咱们也痛痛快快过几年！
    （里边喊：“张庆元，李老贵，快来领土地证！”）
    老汉：忽听学堂里喊一声，赶快去领土地证。
    老婆：老头子，等一等，我看还是我去领，你心眼死，手脚笨，打个手印也打不正。
    老汉：算了吧，少麻烦，这事那能妇女办？连个大名也没有，趁早回家去作饭。
    老婆：老东西，你不要脸，不能把妇女来小看。分地俺也有一份，不叫我去定不沾。
    老汉：好好好，不要嚷，两个名字全写上，咱俩一块上前领，男女平等是一样。（二人下）（懒汉上）
    懒汉：淘气倒了霉，墙倒众人推，个个提意见，众人都反对，说我淘气是懒汉，二流子成性不生产，不给我发土地证，只有咱的使用权，不许当，不许卖，这下叫我傻了脸。我…………我脸皮厚，舌头软，死皮赖脸再谈一谈，只要土地证得到手，佃当买卖全由咱。（老头、老婆拿土地证高兴的上）
    老汉：土地证，真好看，鲜红官印盖中间，土地房屋有了主，出力使劲闹生产。
    老婆：土地证，四方方，黑字写在白纸上。俺的家财有保障，怎不叫老婆喜洋洋。
    懒汉：上去叫声庆元哥，咱们相好又不错，你给咱多把好话说，土地证发给我，从今以后定改过。
    老汉：（讥讽地）噢，发下土地证，赶紧卖了地，换烧饼。哎！二年一清算，一年一平分，胜利果实吃不清，你还要什么土地证？
    懒汉：（又走到老婆跟前）庆元嫂子听我言，我淘气以后要转变，要是发给我土地证，我一定好好闹生产。
    老婆：哼！狗打千遍也吃屎，懒惰成性难转变。你这武大郎坐江山，没人敢保险。哎！老头子，给我那土地证，我再好好看一看，土地回家大团圆，老婆我越看越喜欢。（故意气淘气）
    干部：（上）哎！看这一对老来红，高兴的不知西和东。
    懒汉：（上前请求的）叫山堂，好弟兄会上错误我承认，我的思想早搞通，今儿个发给我土地证，一定生产好劳动。如今我生活太困难，你们大家多照应。
    干部：叫淘气，听明白，别在这里耍无赖。这二年你年年分土地，不是输了就是卖，你沾了便宜还卖乖，这一套以后吃不开。告你说，一切的花样不中用，老老实实去劳动，只要你真正能转变，以后就给你土地证，再要偷懒不生产，这四亩地也不叫你种。（淘气低头）
    老婆：山堂来给咱念念土地证，叫你大婶再听一听。（三人看）
    懒汉：（心中痛苦内心斗争）唉！拳打肉皮疼，话说骨头疼。说的心中好难过，二流子道路行不通。靠清算，靠斗争，胜利果实吃不成。卖房卖地全不行，苍蝇吃屁一场空。前边只有一条道，下地生产去劳动。咬咬牙，狠狠心，我还是一个年青人，从今后好好干，不信我就不如人。唉！我说这话也没人信，只能自己把自己恨，几十年我没掉过一滴泪，今个泪珠不住往下滚。
    老婆：（看土地证后笑）写的好，写的清，老头子你可放了心，咱多割草，多沤粪，单等秋后把麦种。
    老汉：对！多种麦，多上粪，我还组织拨换工，从今土地不变动，安心生产过光景。（二人笑，淘气一边在哭出声来）
    干部：叫淘气，怎么的，有什么心事你提提。
    懒汉：（惭愧）淘气今天好惭愧，未曾说话把头低，人要脸，树要皮，淘气我一定争口气，再当懒汉不生产，我就是个大闺女养活的！
    众：（笑）好，浪子回头金不换，咱们大家都喜欢。只要你决心真转变，以后就给你所有权。
    老汉：咱们组织拨工组，互相帮助把工换。
    众：（合）今天发下土地证，努力生产加油干，妇女也要去下地，二流子决心要转变，安心团结闹生产，发财致富万万年。（完）
