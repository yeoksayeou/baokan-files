Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Reports from various sources: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Polish Socialist Party has successfully concluded on the 22nd. The Socialist Party issued a public statement saying that the Central Plenary Session comprehensively analyzed the path the Socialist Party had taken, reviewed all errors and vacillations that hindered the Socialist Party's progress, and exposed the roots of these errors in order to overcome and eliminate them in the minds of Socialist Party members, so that they would not become a burden to the unified party of the Polish working class. The resolution passed by the Central Plenary Session declared that it would take a firm attitude towards those Socialist Party members who, as Secretary-General Cyrankiewicz stated, were still working according to "bad traditions." The plenary session also passed a resolution to replace several senior members of the Socialist Party. Chairman Romnic of the Central Executive Committee has been removed from his post and replaced by the left-wing leader and Minister of Justice, Swiatkowski. Morawski (former Chairman of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, Prime Minister of the Polish Provisional Government, and current Minister of Public Administration) has been removed from all positions in the Central Executive Committee. Szwalbe (Deputy Speaker of the Polish Parliament) has resigned from his position as Chairman of the Supreme Council. Drobnar and Wacowicz, two people considered unable to abandon their right-wing traditions, have also resigned from their positions in the Supreme Council. The plenary session conducted a heated debate centered on Cyrankiewicz's report, which demanded that the Polish Socialist Party finally and completely separate from the right-wing traditions of the Socialist Party that opposed communists, distrusted the Soviet Union, and were nationalistic. The discussion on economic issues at the plenary session was led by Lange, who incisively analyzed what the economy of a people's democratic country is, pointing out that it cannot be considered a permanent economic form, but must be considered a transitional form towards socialism; otherwise, it will inevitably revert to capitalism.

　　波社会党全会闭幕
    清算错误思想与右翼传统分家
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】各方报导：波兰社会党中央委员会全会已于二十二日胜利闭幕。社会党发表公报称，中央全会全盘地分析了社会党经历的道路，审查了妨碍社会党进步的一切错误和动摇，揭露了这些错误的根源，以便在社会党党员的思想中加以克服和肃清，使他们不致为波兰工人阶级的统一政党增加负担。中央全会通过的决议宣称，它将对那些如总书记西伦凯维兹所称，仍按“坏传统”进行工作的社会党人采取坚决态度。全会又通过撤换若干社会党高级人员的决议，中央执行委员会主席罗辛尼克已被撤职，改由左翼领袖、司法部长斯维特科夫斯基继任，摩拉夫斯基（前波兰民族解放委员会主席、波兰临时政府总理、现任政府公共行政部长）已被免去中央执行委员会的一切职务，石瓦尔贝（波议会副议长）已辞去最高委员会主席之职，被认为不可能弃绝其右翼传统的两人——德罗柏涅尔和瓦却维兹，亦已辞去其在最高委员会中之职务，全会以西伦凯维兹的报告为中心进行了热烈的辩论，该报告要求波兰社会党与对抗共产党人的、不信任苏联的、及民族主义的社会党右翼传统最后地和完全地分家。全会关于经济问题的讨论由兰基领导，他精辟地分析了什么是人民民主国家的经济，指出它不能被认为是永久的经济形式，而必须被认为是走向社会主义的过渡形式，否则，它将不可避免地回复到资本主义。
