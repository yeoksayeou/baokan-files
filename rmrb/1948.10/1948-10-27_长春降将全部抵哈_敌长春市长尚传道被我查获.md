Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 25th: Zheng Dongguo, who surrendered with his troops in Changchun, is 45 years old and from Shimen, Hunan. He graduated from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. During the anti-Japanese war in India and Burma around 1944, he served as the commander of the Kuomintang New 1st Army and deputy commander-in-chief of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India, which were equipped, trained, and commanded by the United States. After the Japanese surrender, he successively held the positions of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Command of the Kuomintang, Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Suppression Headquarters, Chairman of Jilin Province, and Commander of the Changchun Garrison. Li Hong, the commander of the Kuomintang New 7th Army who surrendered on the orders of Zheng Dongguo, is also from Hunan. Before the establishment of the New 7th Army, he was the commander of the Kuomintang New 38th Division. The New 38th Division was the main force of the Kuomintang New 1st Army and was formerly commanded by Sun Liren, the current Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Army. The New 38th Division was the first American-equipped division in the Kuomintang army, and the Americans have always considered this division to be the strongest in combat effectiveness in the Kuomintang army. Now, all of the division’s American equipment has been neatly and cleanly handed over to the Northeast People's Liberation Army.
