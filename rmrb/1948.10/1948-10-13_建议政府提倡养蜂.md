　　Suggestion to the Government to Promote Beekeeping
    This summer, I spoke with a fellow villager (from Qiji Village, Pingshan) who sells honey in Wangzi Village, Pingshan. According to him, "With a dozen or so hives, he can collect twenty to thirty catties of honey per hive when the walnut, persimmon, and black date flowers bloom in spring." Speaking of the area along the Pinghan Railway, each hive can yield forty to fifty catties of honey each year during the single buckwheat flower season (with good techniques, even more can be collected). Each village can raise forty to fifty hives. Calculated this way, this is a significant income, not only from the honey but also from dividing the hives. For example, buying a hive in the spring, if raised well, can be divided into two or three hives in a year, and each hive can still yield forty to fifty catties of honey. Calculating this again the following year, even more hives can be divided, and more honey can be collected (but the honey source of each village also has limitations on the number of hives it can sustain; ordinary villages can sustain fifty to sixty hives). Therefore, to revitalize the rural economy, this is a very good sideline. After the land reform, the primary task in rural areas is to develop production. I specifically suggest that the government promote it.

    The Ministry of Agriculture believes Comrade Jian Lin's opinion is very good. In the future, we should call on and specifically help the masses develop this sideline. Regarding the issues of bee species and beekeeping technology, the government and cooperatives should pay attention to helping solve them. However, areas promoting beekeeping should pay attention to honey sources to avoid over-beekeeping and insufficient honey sources, leading to losses.

### 建议政府提倡养蜂

　　建议政府提倡养蜂
    今年夏天，我在平山王子村和一位卖蜜的老乡（平山七吉村人）谈话，据他说：“有蜂十几窠，在春天核桃花、柿子花和黑枣花开时，就每窠取蜜二三十斤。”按平汉路沿线说：每年只荞麦花一季，每窠也取蜜四五十斤（技术好了，还可再多取蜜），每村都可养四五十窠，这样计算下来，这是一笔很大的收入，不但收了蜜，还可分蜂。比如：春天买一窠，养好了，一年可分两三窠，每窠还可取蜜四五十斤，第二年再照算去，蜂分的更多，蜜取的也更多（但每村的蜜源，能维持窠数，也是有限制的，普通的村，可维持五六十窝）。所以繁荣农村经济，这是很好的副业。土地改革后，农村中首要工作就是发展生产，特建议政府提倡。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　冀中五中　　健林
    健林同志的意见，农业部认为很好，今后应号召并具体帮助群众发展这一副业，关于蜂种和养蜂技术问题，政府和合作社要注意帮助解决，但提倡养蜂的地区应当注意到蜜源，以免养蜂过多，蜜源不足，致受损失。
