　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th -- Reports from various sources: Just as the notorious Liberal Democratic Party of Japan's plan to organize a conservative cabinet is failing due to disputes over the spoils, the 21 members of the Japanese Communist Party and the Democratic Defense League held a meeting on the 10th and decided to nominate Kuroda Hisao, chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Labor-Farmer Party, as a candidate for the next prime minister. Kuroda was originally a left-wing member of the Socialist Party, but he resigned from the party a few days ago due to dissatisfaction with the Socialist Party's corruption. Prior to this, when the Ashida cabinet collapsed on the 7th, the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement opposing the formation of a conservative cabinet and warning the Socialist Party to sever ties with conservative elements. At the same time, the Japanese Federation of Industrial Labor Unions declared that the collapse of the Ashida cabinet was the result of pressure from the people, led by labor. The recently exposed corruption scandals are "only part of the corruption of the current ruling class." The Federation demanded the immediate dissolution of the parliament in order to establish a people's government centered on the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, with the participation of labor and peasant representatives. The Japanese Confederation of Labor, which has close ties with the Socialist Party, also expressed opposition to the Liberal Democratic Party's formation of a conservative and reactionary cabinet. The propositions of the Japanese Communist Party, the Democratic Defense League, and the two major labor unions are a counterattack against the cabinet formation activities of Shigeru Yoshida, president of the Liberal Democratic Party, under MacArthur's protection. Shigeru Yoshida originally planned to organize a one-party conservative cabinet of the reactionary Liberal Democratic Party, while the Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the People's Cooperative Party, the Socialist Reform Party, and others planned to organize a joint conservative cabinet of reactionary parties. On the 10th, the leaders of the five parties held a meeting, at which the other four party leaders agreed that the Liberal Democratic Party should take the initiative in the cabinet formation matters. Shigeru Yoshida believes that this is the president of the Liberal Democratic Party organizing a caretaker cabinet, while he demands to serve as the official cabinet prime minister. There are still many divisions between and within the reactionary parties. As of the 12th, a week has passed since the collapse of the Ashida cabinet, and the new cabinet is still difficult to produce.

　　日共与保卫民主同盟
  　提名黑田候选首相
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方报导：正当臭名远扬的日本民主自由党组织保守内阁的计划因分赃不匀难产之时，日本共产党和保卫民主同盟之二十一位议员于十日举行会议，决定提名工农党筹备委员会主席黑田寿男为下届首相候选人。按黑田原为社会党左派，数日前因不满社会党的腐败，愤而脱党。前此，日本共产党于七日芦田内阁倒台之时，曾发表声明，反对组织保守内阁，并正告社会党与保守分子断绝关系。同时，日本产业劳动组合联合会宣称：芦田内阁的垮台，是以劳工为首的人民的压力所造成的结果。最近暴露的舞弊丑案，“只是现在统治阶级腐化面的一部分”。产联要求立即解散议会，借以建立以共产党和社会党为中心的、有工农代表参加的人民政府。与社会党关系密切的日本劳动组合总同盟，也表示反对由民主自由党组织保守的反动内阁。日本共产党、保卫民主同盟以及两大工会的主张，是对于麦克阿瑟卵翼下的民主自由党总裁吉田茂组阁活动的抗击。吉田茂原图组织反动的民主自由党的一党保守内阁，而民主党、社会党、国民协同党、社会革新党等则图组织反动政党的联合保守内阁。十日，五党党魁举行会议，会上其他四党党魁同意在组阁事宜上由民主自由党取得主动权。吉田茂认为这是以民主自由党总裁组织照管内阁，而他则要求出任正式内阁首相。反动政党之间及党内分歧仍然很多。迄十二日止，芦田内阁倒台已将一周，新阁仍在难产中。
