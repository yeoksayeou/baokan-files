　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Diantong News Agency, Paris: A mass meeting was held here on the evening of the 20th to protest the farce that American reactionaries will stage on November 1st, trying the twelve leaders of the American Communist Party. French Communist leader Duclos declared at the meeting that the trial of American communists is closely linked to America's war plans. Amidst loud applause, Duclos declared: When Truman's name has been forgotten, the people will still talk about the American Communist Party. He reiterated: The French people will never march alongside American war plans. The Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party recently also sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the American Communist Party, expressing fraternal greetings to the American Communist leaders who are about to be tried.
　　Note: The Truman government previously announced the arrest of the twelve members of the Central Committee of the American Communist Party on July 20th, on the eve of the Progressive Party convention. After being bailed out by the Human Rights Guarantee Conference, the American reactionary judicial authorities originally scheduled the so-called "trial" for October 15th, but later decided to postpone it to the day before the American election. This is clearly a trick to strike and intimidate progressive people in order to influence the election results.

　　巴黎人民举行大会抗议审讯美共领袖
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】电通社巴黎讯：此间于二十日晚举行大会，抗议美国反动派行将在十一月一日扮演审讯十二位美共领袖的丑剧。法共领袖杜克洛在会上宣称：对美国共产党人的审判，是与美国的战争计划密切联系的。杜克洛在响亮的掌声中宣称：在杜鲁门名字已被忘了的时候，人民还将谈及美国共产党。他重复地说：法国人民决不会与美国战争计划并肩行进。奥地利共产党中央最近亦致电美共中央，对行将受审的美共领袖表示兄弟的慰问。
    按：杜鲁门政府前曾于进步党大会前夕（七月二十日）宣布逮捕美共十二位中央委员。经人权保障大会保出后，美国反动司法当局原订于十月十五日进行所谓“审讯”，后又决定展期至美国大选之前一日举行，此显系打击与恐吓进步人民以图影响选举结果的诡计。
