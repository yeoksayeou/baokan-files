Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Paris dispatch: The French laboring people are launching a new strike movement. While the strikes of 50,000 miners and metalworkers in Musso and Moselle provinces (northeastern France) are continuing, and the strike of 11,000 metalworkers in Chaco lasted for a month has not stopped, 250,000 coal miners have decided on the 30th of last month to hold a nationwide strike on the 4th to oppose the Queuille government's so-called "economy" decree to lay off one-tenth of the workers in the nationalized coal industry, and demanded a 40% increase in wages and an increase in the basic wage to 14,300 francs per month. Gas and electricity workers in Paris also decided to hold a four-hour warning strike on the 1st for this purpose. If the demands are rejected, an indefinite strike will be held. The French Communist Party organ, L'Humanité, condemned the Queuille government's so-called "economy" decree promulgated in accordance with the Marshall Plan, saying: "This is not only against the interests of workers in nationalized industries, but is actually aimed at abolishing these industrial sectors. The purpose of this decree is to eliminate the French coal mining industry in order to benefit American trusts." L'Humanité, in discussing the coal miners' upcoming strike, pointed out: "Millions of French men and women will support the miners' strike to defend national interests in various ways."

　　法劳动人民展开新罢工运动
    二十五万矿工将罢工
    【新华社陕北五日电】巴黎讯：法国劳动人民正开展新的罢工运动。当穆索和莫塞尔省（法东北部）的五万矿工和金属工人的罢工还在继续，沙科特城一万一千金属工人已进行一月的罢工还没有停止的时候，二十五万煤矿工人已于上月三十日决议于四日举行全国罢工，以反对葛义政府在国有化煤业中解雇十分之一工人的所谓“节约”法令，并要求增资百分之四十，提高基本工资至每月一万四千三百法郎。巴黎煤气与电力工人亦为此决定于一日进行四小时警告性罢工，如要求被拒绝，则将举行无限期的罢工。法共机关报人道报谴责葛义政府遵照马歇尔计划所颁布的所谓“节约”法令称：“这不仅是反对国有化工业工人的利益，而且实际上在于取消这些工业部门。这一法令的目的是在排除法国煤矿工业以便有益于美国托辣斯。”人道报在论到煤业工人将举行的罢工时指出：“千百万法国男女将以各种方法支持矿工们为保卫国家利益而举行的罢工。”
