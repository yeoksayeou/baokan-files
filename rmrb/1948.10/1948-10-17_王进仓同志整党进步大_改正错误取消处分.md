　　【Taihang Telegram】Comrade Wang Jincang, a party member from Xincun in the First District of Huguan, has been actively working and correcting his mistakes, and his punishment of being placed on probation within the Party has now been revoked. During the Party consolidation this spring, Comrade Jincang was punished with being removed from his position in the village government by the masses and placed on probation within the Party for one year due to serious mistakes he had made in his work. At that time, Comrade Jincang sincerely accepted the punishment given to him by the Party and expressed his determination to wholeheartedly serve the masses in the future, make contributions to offset his faults, and transform himself. He still had optimistic confidence in his future and did not become pessimistic or disappointed because of this. He believed that as long as he could correct his mistakes and truly work for the masses, the Party and the people would not abandon him. However, on the other hand, he always felt that he had been punished in the Party consolidation and was no longer a cadre, so how could he serve the masses? He was ideologically troubled and distressed.

　　Later, he figured it out and decided to actively participate in production and play an exemplary role, frequently publicize the Party's policies, and with the approval of the branch, set up a blackboard newspaper. Every time the village undertook a task, he would collect correct opinions and model deeds from the masses, combine them with the Party's policies, and compile them into quick-clapper rhymes. After the branch reviewed them, he would write them on the blackboard newspaper to promote the movement forward. In this way, he compiled a total of thirteen quick-clapper rhymes, which played a significant role. For example, during the spring plowing season, when social order was unstable and rumors were rampant and superstitious things were happening, he compiled an anti-superstition quick-clapper rhyme, which aroused the common vigilance of cadres and the masses. In seven or eight days, cadres and the masses cracked down on a feudal superstitious Taoist organization that was sabotaging production in the west street of the village. In terms of production, whenever he discovered model examples or individuals or groups, he would compile them into quick-clapper rhymes to commend them and motivate everyone. He also used various opportunities to publicize the Party's land reform and production policies, dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, and promote production. For example, when he joined the Li Suoze mutual aid team, some middle peasants had ideological concerns and were afraid to actively produce. He said, "The land in our village has undergone the final adjustment, and the land reform has been completed. The task from now on is not to carry out land reform again, but to engage in production. Whoever produces well is a model." This cleared up the middle peasants' thinking, and they all actively started production. Due to Comrade Jincang's active and responsible work, especially his role in promoting and leading production, the masses elected him as the village deputy, and the Party, based on his performance in this period of work, revoked his punishment, and he was also elected as the deputy secretary of the branch.

　　After becoming a cadre, he was not arrogant but remained very humble. He was afraid that the masses would fear him for retaliation, so he often expressed his attitude at various meetings. He said: "If everyone hadn't offered opinions, the Xincun branch would not have been reformed well. If everyone had offered opinions earlier, the Xincun branch would not have had so many problems. If everyone hadn't offered me opinions, I wouldn't have known how bad I was going to get. Offering opinions is helping to transform me. Whoever offers the most opinions is my family. If I don't work hard, I will be letting everyone down."

### 王进仓同志整党进步大　改正错误取消处分

　　王进仓同志整党进步大
  　改正错误取消处分
    【太行电】壶关一区辛村党员王进仓同志，积极工作，改正错误，现已取消了留党察看的处分。进仓同志在今春整党时，因自己在工作上犯了较严重的错误，曾受到群众撤换其在村政权中的职务，党内给以留党察看一年的处分。当时进仓同志一方面很诚恳的接受了党给予自己的处分，并表示今后要坚决为群众好好服务，立功抵过，改造自己，对自己的前途仍有光明信心，没有因此而悲观失望。他相信只要自己能改正错误，真正为群众办事，党和人民是不会扔了自己的。但另一方面总感到自己在整党中是受了处分又不是干部了，究竟怎样为群众服务？他思想上很作难，很苦恼。
    后来他想通了，就决心好好参加生产起模范带头作用，经常宣传党的政策，并得到支部同意，办了一个黑板报，村里每做一个工作，他就搜集群众中的正确意见模范事迹，结合党的政策，编成快板，经过支部审查，写在黑板报上，来推动运动向前开展。这样前后共编了十三篇快板，起了很大作用。如正在春耕时节，社会秩序不安，谣言流行迷信事情发生的时候，他就编出了反迷信快板，引起干部群众的共同警惕。七、八天时间，干部群众就在本村西街破获了一个破坏生产的封建迷信的道门组织。在生产方面，他一发现有生产模范事例或人或组，就编成快板来表扬，推动大家。并利用各种机会宣传党的土改、生产政策，解除群众的思想顾虑，推动生产。如他参加李锁则互助组，有些中农有思想顾虑，不敢积极生产，他就说：“咱村土地已进行了最后调剂，土改已完成了，今后任务不是再搞土改，而是好好闹生产，谁生产的好谁就是模范。”打通了中农思想，都积极生产开了。进仓同志由于在工作上积极负责，特别在生产上起了推动带头作用，群众又选他为村副，党也根据他在这段工作中的表现，取消了他的处分，他并被选为副支书。
    当了干部后，他并不自傲，仍然是很虚心的。他怕群众害怕他报复，就经常在各种会议上表明自己态度。他说：“不是大家提意见，辛村支部就改造不好，大家要早点提意见，辛村支部就不会发生那样多的毛病，要不是大家给我提意见，我还不知道要坏到啥地步，提意见是帮助改造我，谁提的意见多，谁是我的亲人，我要不好好工作，就对不起大家。”
