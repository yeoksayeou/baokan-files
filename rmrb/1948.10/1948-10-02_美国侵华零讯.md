American Aggression Against China - News Snippets

　　▲ The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration has established another "China Aid Program Public Advisory Committee," appointing five members, including notorious imperialist and former U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, Paul V. McNutt, to be specifically responsible for studying "the degree and method of practical and appropriate supervision" of the Kuomintang government and other so-called "policy" issues.

　　▲ The U.S. government has appointed Mr. Bate and Mr. Moya as American members of the "China Rural Reconstruction Committee," and they will soon come to China. The Kuomintang government has appointed Chiang Menglin, Y.C. James Yen (note: Yen has always flaunted the banner of "mass educationist" to swindle people in the country. He recently visited the United States to assist the United States in formulating a so-called "new anti-communist plan" for the invasion of rural China, namely the establishment of the so-called "China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee," and was favored by his American masters), and Shen Zonghan as members. The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration announced that the committee will "select three or four provinces whose governors can cooperate with it" to begin large-scale implementation of its plan of aggression against rural China.

　　▲ The head of the China branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, Roger Lapham, flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou via Hong Kong on the 17th to meet with T.V. Soong to discuss "South China construction issues" and to make "general observations" of South China.

　　▲ According to a statement by the U.S. Navy Department on the 24th, the U.S. Navy Special Mixed Fleet is scheduled to sail to China and Japan on October 1st for so-called "routine voyages." According to the Central News Agency, three cruisers and eight destroyers will leave Pearl Harbor to join the fleet heading to Qingdao, where they will be stationed for three to four months.
