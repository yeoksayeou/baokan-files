　　Northern Yue Prefecture Conducts Water Conservancy Inspection
    [Northern Yue News] The First Special Prefecture recently inspected the water conservancy work of its subordinate counties, based on the water conservancy plan formulated in June. According to incomplete statistics from various counties, 52 new and repaired old canals have been built in the past six months, irrigating more than 52,000 mu of land. The key project of flood inundation and silt deposition covered an area of 27,057 mu, completing 90% of the total requirements. When the autumn land consolidation is included in the calculation, the plan will be fully guaranteed to be completed. In terms of newly built and repaired old canals, Guangling, Fanshi, and Yingxian have newly built 6 canals and repaired 40 old ones, depositing silt on a total of 25,212 mu of land. Together with the 6 key canals in various counties, there are a total of 52 canals with a silt deposition area of 52,269 mu.
    In terms of flood control projects, 15 village and land protection dams and 12 water control dams with wing-shaped layouts have been newly built, added to, or repaired in 14 villages in the five counties of Hunyuan, Lingqiu, Fanshi, Yingxian, and Yanggao. The Hunyuan Chengguan flood control dam project is the largest. Four new triangular wing-shaped stone dams were built, using 437.5 cubic meters of stone (100 cubic feet per cubic meter). Seven wing-shaped stone dams were repaired and enlarged, using 398 cubic meters of stone and 20,000 jin of lime. The embankment was widened and thickened with sand, and 518.4 cubic meters of sand were dredged from the river, covering a length of 110 zhang. After the flood, the wing-shaped stone dams that were added and repaired played a water control role. Planned dredging of the river and sand extraction also increased the water diversion function of the two tributary rivers. Due to the construction of wing dams, the river channel shifted westward, and the main channel of the river widened. The phenomenon of sand and gravel siltation in the riverbed has gradually stopped in the past two years, and even dredging has occurred. Although the heads of two wing dams were broken by the flood, the downstream embankment remained intact due to their water resistance, and the lives and property of 30,000 people in Chengguan were protected from flood damage. The two damaged dams were repaired immediately after the damage.
    Organizational leadership has been strengthened, and water management has been improved. The special zone has adopted key leadership, absorbing experience and promoting it universally. In Fanshi, under the direct guidance of the special zone, canal management organizations were established in key villages and promoted to 55 villages. Guangling also established joint village water conservancy committees and village water conservancy committees or water conservancy commissioners, and universally established local household groups. In Yingxian, with the direct assistance of the administrative office, the Guangji Canal has greatly improved in water management. Clean water is used centrally, the area of irrigated land has increased, and the flood silt deposition has strictly implemented the rotational irrigation method from the upper to the lower reaches. Dongzhuzhuang, which had never seen floods before, had the opportunity to deposit silt this year. The feudal privileges of water use are being abolished step by step, and the water use days of Nanmazhuang are being reduced.
    However, some counties and districts do not pay enough attention to this project, do not conduct in-depth investigations, emphasize that the masses are unwilling to build, commit tailism, and do not organize and explain policies to eliminate ideological concerns of cadres and the masses. As a result, water conservancy and flood control work have not been widely carried out, and have not become a mass-based, organized, and led work. Except for Fanshi, which has better leadership, Guangling and Yingxian are more developed, while Lingqiu and Hunyuan have not made any progress except for key projects. In the leadership of the special zone, a planned and inspected working method has not been well established. The special zone has only carried out some key projects and has not actually gone to various places to inspect and assist in carrying out water conservancy and flood control work.

　　北岳一专检查水利
    【北岳讯】一专署顷依据六月份所订水利计划，检查所属各县水利工作。根据各县不完整材料统计，半年来新修整旧渠五二道，淤灌土地达五万二千余亩，重点工程洪泛放淤面积为二七零五七亩，完成了全部要求百分之九十。秋后汇地再计算在内，将有保证的全部完成计划。在新修整旧渠道方面，广灵繁峙应县共新修六道、整旧四○道，共放淤土地二五二一二亩，连各县重点渠道六道，共计五二道、放淤面积五二二六九亩。
    防洪工程上，浑源、灵邱、繁峙、应县、阳高五个县一四村新修、加修、补修护村护地坝一五道，汇翅制水坝一二座，而尤以浑源城关防洪坝工程为最大。新修三角汇翅石坝四座，用石四三七·五方（每方一○○立方尺）。整修加大汇翅石坝七座，用石三九八方，石灰二○○○○斤，加宽培厚顺坝沙里工程，浚河取沙五一八·四方，培覆顺坝长度为一一○丈。该工程洪水后，所加修及整修之汇翅石坝，均起制水作用。有计划浚河取沙，亦起加大二支河的分水作用。河漕因雁翅坝设施向西移，河道正漕加宽，河床沙石淤填现象，在近二年来逐渐停止，甚至刷采。虽然在洪水时两个雁坝被洪水冲断坝头，但因其拒水力而顺坝赖以无恙，城关三万人民的生命财产免受水害。该两坝坏后当即修复。
    加强了组织领导，改进使水管理，专区采取重点领导，吸收经验普遍推广。繁峙在专区直接辅导下，由重点村组织渠道管理机构推广到五五村普遍建立。广灵也建立起联村水利委员会，及村水利委员会或水利委员，普遍建立地户小组。应县在行署直接协助下，广济渠在使水管理上有很大改进。清水集中使用，浇地面积增大，洪水放淤确实执行了上轮下至的轮灌法。始终未见到洪水的东西朱庄，今年都得到洪水放淤的机会。有步骤的取消封建性的使水特权，减少南马庄的使水日。
    但有的县区对这一工程重视的不够，不作深入调查，强调群众不愿兴修，犯了尾巴主义，不去组织与解释政策，消除干部群众思想顾虑。因之水利工作及防洪工作没有普遍开展起来，成为群众性的有组织有领导的工作。除繁峙领导较好外，广灵与应县较开展，灵邱与浑源除重点工程，没有一点开展。在专区领导上，有计划有检查的工作方法没有很好建立起来，专区只作了些重点工程，没有实际到各地检查协助开展水利及防洪工作。　（李静波、李毅民）
