Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. TASS reports: The working people of Belgium and Denmark oppose rising prices. Belgian Communist Party General Secretary Lallemand delivered a speech at a rally of 5,000 working people in Liège, the heavy industrial center of eastern Belgium, on the 24th, pointing out that Belgian prices have risen by 20 percent in the past year, and the number of unemployed has increased to 125,000. This is the result of the Belgian ruling class's acceptance of the Marshall Plan, which has allowed the economic crisis to grow in Belgium. Lallemand continued that prices will rise further due to the government's intention to raise the prices of coal, electricity, and sugar. The Belgian working people recognize that the current government is leading Belgium towards disaster. In Denmark, the actual living standards of the working people have fallen by 20 to 25 percent in the past six months. The Soviet Labor Newspaper pointed out that as a result of Denmark borrowing 40 million U.S. dollars from the so-called "International Development Bank" and accepting the Marshall Plan, Denmark's dependence on the U.S. and Britain has increased. The Labor Newspaper continued that in recent weeks, workers across Denmark have held meetings to protest the lowering of the living standards of the working people and oppose subordinating Danish interests to the expansionist policies of the U.S. and Britain in Europe.

　　马歇尔计划使物价上涨
    比丹人民集会抗议
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社报导：比利时丹麦两国劳动人民反对物价上涨。比利时共产党总书记拉尔曼二十四日在比国东部重工业中心列日五千劳动人民的集会上发表演说，指出：过去一年来，比利时物价已上涨百分之二十，失业人数增至十二万五千人。这是由于比国统治阶级接受马歇尔计划使经济危机在比国生长的结果。拉尔曼继称，由于政府打算提高煤、电力与糖的价格，物价将更上涨。比国劳动人民认识目前的政府正引导比国走向灾难。在丹麦，劳动人民的实际生活水平半年来降低了百分之二十至二十五。苏联劳动报指出，由于丹麦向所谓“国际开发银行”贷款四千万美元及接受马歇尔计划的结果，丹麦对美英的附属性已愈益增加。劳动报继称，最近数周中，全丹麦各地工人曾举行会议，抗议降低劳动人民生活水平，反对把丹麦利益从属于美英在欧洲的扩张政策。
