  　Demand Food
  　Petition Traitor Chiang Twice But He Refuses to Meet Them
    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 22nd] Starving students in Peiping have twice demanded food from the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. According to a report in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao: On October 5th, students from fourteen municipal middle schools and vocational schools in Peiping formed the "Peiping Municipal Schools Food Shortage Relief Committee," and each sent a representative to Chiang's residence to petition, waiting all day on empty stomachs, but Chiang refused to meet them. The petitioning representatives described the students' suffering, saying: There are more than 3,000 boarding students in the fourteen schools, and because they cannot buy corn flour, they can only send people to the streets every day with cloth bags to buy cornbread. They can't even buy pickles, and they eat one meal of boiled water and cornbread at a time. Two days before this petition, more than a thousand students from various middle schools in Shanxi who were stranded in Peiping, because it was approaching late autumn and there were no concrete solutions for food, housing, and the establishment of temporary middle schools, sent a delegation of 150 people to Chiang's Peiping residence on October 3rd, but Chiang also refused to meet them. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on October 8th: Amidst the severe food shortage, the Kuomintang government actually stopped the student food ration measure in September, and the meals of various universities in Peiping will be forced to stop. The Peking University Student Union has put forward four demands to the school, asking it to request the Kuomintang government to solve the problem of eating.

　　饥饿的北平学生
  　提出要饭吃的要求
  　两度向蒋贼请愿蒋避不见面
    【新华社华北二十二日电】饥饿的北平学生，两度向蒋贼介石要饭吃。据天津大公报报导：十月五日，北平十四个市立中学及专科学校学生，组成“北平市立各校粮荒求助委员会”，各派代表一人赴蒋贼行馆请愿，饿着肚子候了一天，但为蒋贼拒绝接见。请愿的代表诉说学生痛苦情形称：十四校住校学生达三千余人，因为买不到玉米面，只有每天派人提着布袋到街头收买窝头。咸菜也买不到，开水窝头吃一顿找一顿。在此次请愿之前两日，流落北平的山西各中学学生千余人因时近深秋，食住及设立临时中学尚无具体办法，于十月三日推派代表一百五十人结队赴蒋贼北平行馆请愿，但亦为蒋贼拒绝接见。另据十月八日天津益世报报导：在粮荒严重声中，国民党政府竟于九月起停止学生配面措施，平市各大学膳食将被迫断炊。北大学生自治会已向校方提出四项要求，请代向国民党政府要求解决吃饭问题。
