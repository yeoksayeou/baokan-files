Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th -- At the First Political Work Conference of the East China Military Region, Shu Tong, Director of the Political Department of the Military Region, summarized the experience of the new-style military consolidation movement in the East China People's Liberation Army. Director Shu first summarized that the "Three Checks and Three Consolidations" (check composition, check ideology, check work; consolidate ideology, consolidate organization, consolidate work style) are the specific contents of the new-style military consolidation movement in the East China troops. The main method of carrying out this movement is to fully promote democracy and fully follow the mass line. The purpose is to combine leadership with the masses, use the method of combining top-down and bottom-up criticism and self-criticism, resolutely expose and overcome various undesirable tendencies existing in the troops, improve leadership style, thereby enhance internal and external unity, improve the troops' level of awareness and combat strength, and gradually strengthen the troops' construction in all aspects according to Chairman Mao's ideological and organizational principles. The main gains of the "Three Checks and Three Consolidations" are: First, the troops' class consciousness and political awareness have been greatly improved, and the sense of discipline and policy awareness have also been greatly enhanced; second, a correct view and position of the people's army on land reform has been clearly established; third, the serious phenomenon of corruption and embezzlement in the troops and the bad tendencies of mountain-stronghold mentality and departmentalism have been basically overcome; fourth, the realization of the Three Great Democracies (political democracy, military democracy, economic democracy) has severely hit the tendency of warlordism and bureaucracy in the troops, and the leadership style has been greatly improved and progressed; fifth, a certain degree of organizational construction has been implemented, and there is a new clear understanding and transformation of the Party's line of army building and organizational line. In the early stage of the check and consolidation movement, the following main deviations occurred: First, inappropriately applying the experience of rural land reform; second, the tendency of laissez-faire and extreme democratization in some places; third, the tendency of only considering composition, exaggerating impurity within the Party and inappropriate punishment-ism; fourth, confusing ideological problems with political problems. As for the reasons for these deviations, they were mainly due to being too hasty and demanding too much in guiding ideology, not being clear enough in some places, and even making individual principled mistakes, as well as the influence of impure Party composition and impure work style. In summary, "the achievements and gains of the 'Three Checks and Three Consolidations' are the main and basic aspects of the movement, and the guiding ideology and guiding principles are basically correct. The deviations of the movement are also great, but after gradually clarifying and overcoming the deviations, the positive factors of troop check and consolidation quickly increased, thereby greatly improving the internal and external unity, level of awareness, and combat strength of the troops, and the entire appearance of the troops was completely renewed."

Director Shu pointed out: The basic experiences of the new-style military consolidation movement (Three Checks and Three Consolidations) are as follows: (1) The new-style military consolidation movement should be a led and organized mass democratic movement, and should be carried out with preparation and separately for different troops. Under the general purpose, the goals and contents of military consolidation for a certain period should be proposed according to the specific conditions and tasks of each troop, striving for clarity and specificity, dividing stages, and determining steps; otherwise, the movement will lose its clear goals, and will either be too demanding or fall into blind passivity.

(2) The basic methods for carrying out the new-style military consolidation movement are to promote the Three Great Democracies and follow the mass line; master the combination of top-down and bottom-up criticism and self-criticism; and focus on solving problems from the leadership and ideological levels. It is necessary to master focusing on opening up ideology, otherwise it will be used incorrectly. Although the specific methods and means should be determined according to the characteristics of each troop, the following two basic principles must be mastered: one is that it cannot deviate from the basic purpose of uniting internally, improving leadership, strengthening combat effectiveness, and improving work; the other is that it must distinguish between inside and outside the Party, the army and the local areas, ideological problems and political problems, and avoid generalization and mechanical application of rural experience.

(3) The new-style military consolidation movement includes two major aspects: leading cadres and companies (or staff members, etc.). The company is the foundation of the military consolidation movement, and cadres are the leading backbone of this movement. Neither should be neglected. The steps to be taken should generally be to first open up the minds of cadres, and then use them to carry out ideological mobilization in the companies, so that everyone is clear about the purpose, principles, tasks, and precautions of military consolidation, and break down concerns (such as cadres' fear of promoting democracy and soldiers' lack of belief in democracy). On the one hand, emphasize humbly learning and self-criticism; on the other hand, emphasize being kind to others and curing illnesses to save people. Leaders should closely grasp the situation and grasp the activists. Methods to inspire cadres to conduct checks and consolidations: one is to study documents, two is to listen to reports, and three is to participate in speaking bitterness. The purpose of cadres conducting checks and consolidations, except for individual persistent error-makers, should be to put down ideological "burdens," start up ideological "machines," and improve work efficiency. Otherwise, it will not be success but failure.

(4) The company military consolidation movement can be roughly divided into four stages: the first is the preparation stage, or the incubation stage (conducting various preparations for ideology, organization, and leadership); the second is the class education stage (leading bitterness, speaking bitterness to tracing the roots, or debate and "settling accounts"); the third is the three check stage (including cadres, Party members, and soldiers); the fourth is the three consolidation stage (conducting activities such as supporting cadres and cherishing soldiers, uniting and helping each other, etc.). However, the four stages should not be mechanically separated.

(5) The fundamental issue of democracy is still the issue of ideological work style. Emphasize democracy, but cannot undermine centralization, especially the army needs a higher degree of centralization. Therefore, the democratic movement must be carried out under centralized command, and such led and organized democracy, in turn, is more conducive to correct centralization. The company soldiers' committee is a democratic mass organization that has played a positive role in promoting the Three Great Democracies, but the tendency of exceeding the branch and exceeding the administration should be corrected. It should conduct democratic activities and regular work under the leadership of the branch committee and administrative head.

The Three Checks and Three Consolidations are a specific process from understanding to transformation in terms of ideology, organization, and work style, and therefore should be a continuous and long-term army building and consolidation movement. Do not make subjective impatient mistakes, trying to achieve it all at once in a short time, but should create typical examples, gradually promote them, grasp the key points, and take care of the overall situation. Do not universally call and mobilize from the beginning, especially when the leadership has no direct experience or the troops' level of awareness is not high, special attention should be paid to mastering it.

　　华东新式整军经验
    应是有领导有秩序的群众民主运动从思想上解决问题提高部队战斗力
    【新华社华东三十日电】华东军区第一届政工会议上，军区政治部舒同主任总结了华东人民解放军新式整军运动经验。舒主任首先概括地说明：三查三整（查成份，查思想，查工作；整顿思想，整顿组织，整顿作风）是华东部队进行新式整军运动的具体内容；进行这个运动的主要方式，即是充分发扬民主与充分走群众路线；其目的在于使领导与群众结合起来，运用由上而下与由下而上的批评与自我批评相结合的方法，坚决揭露并克服存于部队中的各种不良倾向，改善领导作风，借以增强内外团结，提高部队觉悟程度和战斗力量，并按毛主席的思想原则、组织原则来逐渐加强部队各方面的建设工作。三查三整的主要收获是：一、部队的阶级觉悟与政治觉悟有了很大的提高，纪律观念与政策观念也大为增强；二、明确树立了人民军队对于土地改革的正确观点与立场；三、基本上克服了部队贪污腐化的严重现象及山头主义、本位主义的恶劣倾向；四、实现三大民主（政治民主、军事民主、经济民主），使部队中的军阀主义、官僚主义倾向受到严重打击，领导作风有了很大的改善和进步；五、实行了一定程度的组织建设，党的建军路线、组织路线有了新的明确的认识和转变。在查整运动初期曾经发生下述的主要偏向：一、不适当地搬用农村土地改革经验；二、某些地方的放任自流和极端民主化的倾向；三、唯成份论的倾向，夸大党内不纯及不适当的惩办主义；四、把思想问题与政治问题混同。至于产生这些偏向的原因主要是由于指导思想上操之过急、要求过高，在某些地方还不够明确，还存在某些偏差，甚至犯了个别带原则性的错误，以及党内成份不纯作风不纯的影响。总起来说，“三查三整的成绩与收获是运动的主要的与基本的方面，指导思想与指导方针基本上是正确的。运动的偏向也是很大的，但在逐渐明确克服了偏向之后，部队查整的积极因素迅速增长，从而使部队的内外团结、觉悟程度与战斗力量有了极大的提高，整个部队面貌为之焕然一新。
    舒主任指出：新式整军运动（三查三整）的基本经验有下列五点：（一）新式整军运动应当是有领导有秩序的群众民主运动，应当有准备地分别不同部队去进行。在总的目的之下，应按各个部队的具体情况，具体任务，提出一定时期的整军目的和内容，力求明确而具体，分清阶段，确定步骤；否则就会使运动失去明确目标，不是要求过高，就是陷于盲目被动。
    （二）开展新式整军运动的基本方法是发扬三大民主，走群众路线；掌握由上而下与由下而上的批评与自我批评；和着重于从领导上、从思想上解决问题。应该掌握以打通思想为主，否则就会运用错误。具体的方式方法虽应按各个部队的特点来决定，但都必须掌握下面两个基本原则：一是不能离开团结内部、改善领导、加强战力、提高工作这个基本目的；一是必须区别党内与党外，军队与地方，思想问题与政治问题，切忌一般化和机械搬运农村经验。
    （三）新式整军运动包含领导干部与连队（或机关人员等）两大方面，连队是整军运动的基础，干部是这个运动的领导骨干，两者不可偏废。进行的步骤一般应该首先打通干部思想，然后通过他们到连队进行思想动员，使大家清楚整军的目的、方针、任务及必须注意的问题，打破顾虑（如干部的怕发扬民主，战士的不大相信民主）。一方面强调虚心学习，自我批评；另方面又要强调与人为善，治病救人。领导者应密切地掌握情况，掌握积极分子。启发干部进行查整的方法：一为学文件，二为听报告，三为参加诉苦。干部进行查整的目的，除了个别坚持错误者以外，都应当是放下思想“包袱”，开动思想“机器”，提高工作效能。否则就不是成功而是失败。
    （四）连队整军运动大致可分为四个阶段：第一为准备阶段，或酝酿阶段（进行思想、组织、领导各种准备工作）；第二为阶级教育阶段（引苦、诉苦到追根，或论战与“算帐”）；第三为三查阶段（包括干部、党员、战士）；第四为三整阶段（进行拥干爱兵，团结互助等工作）。但四个阶段不应机械分开。
    （五）民主的根本问题仍是思想作风问题。强调民主，但不能破坏集中，特别是军队需要有更高度的集中，因此，民主运动就必须在集中指挥下去进行，而这样有领导有秩序的民主，反过来就更有助于正确的集中。连队军人委员会是民主的群众性的组织，对发扬三大民主起了积极作用，但应纠正超支部、超行政的倾向，它应当在支委与行政首长领导下来进行民主活动和经常工作。
    三查三整是从思想上、组织上、作风上由认识到改造的具体过程，因而应该是连续的、长期的建军和整军运动。不能犯主观急性病，在短时间企图一下实现，而应该创造典型，逐步推广，掌握重点，照顾全面，不要一开始就普遍号召和发动，尤其是在领导上没有直接经验或部队觉悟程度不高的情况下，更应特别注意掌握。
