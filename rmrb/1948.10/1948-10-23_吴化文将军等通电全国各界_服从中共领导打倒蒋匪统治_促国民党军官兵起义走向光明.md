Xinhua News Agency, East China, 21st Dispatch: General Wu Huawen, commander of the reorganized 96th Army, and others who revolted on the battlefield during the Jinan Campaign, have issued a circular telegram to all sectors of the country. The full text is as follows:

To Commander Chen, Political Commissar Rao, Deputy Commander Zhang, Deputy Commander Su, Deputy Political Commissar Tan, and to Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the People's Liberation Army and all compatriots across the country, as well as all officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang Army:

Since the invasion of the Japanese pirates, the flames of resistance against Japan have been ignited throughout the country. In the early days of the resistance against Japan, Huawen and others rose up to resist the enemy, just like everyone else. Subsequently, we were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek's policy of "saving the country through a roundabout route," lost our national stance, and made a big mistake. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the people suffered greatly, but we were again ignorant of the greater righteousness and deceived by Chiang Kai-shek to participate in the anti-communist and anti-people civil war, making one mistake after another, and our sins were profound. In the depths of the night, we examine ourselves and are filled with shame and remorse. On September 19th, we resolutely led all officers and soldiers to revolt on the Jinan battlefield, hoping to atone for our past mistakes and march towards the path of light. From now on, we vow to stand on the side of the people, resolutely support the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, obey the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the CCP Central Committee and the military and political leaders of East China, and, under the unified command of the People's Liberation Army, to resolutely expel the aggressive forces of American imperialism, thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and faithfully struggle for the complete liberation of the Chinese people. All the basic policies contained in the declarations of the People's Liberation Army, such as overthrowing the dictatorial government of Chiang Kai-shek; establishing a democratic coalition government; punishing war criminals; eliminating corrupt officials; confiscating bureaucratic capital; developing national industry and commerce; abolishing the dictatorial system of Chiang Kai-shek's rule and implementing a people's democratic system; abolishing the feudal exploitation system and implementing a land system of "land to the tillers"; denying Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous diplomacy; and recognizing the equal autonomy of all ethnic groups within the country, are all urgent demands of the Chinese people and the best way to save the country and the people. Huawen and others must regard them as the guiding principles, devote ourselves wholeheartedly, and never change our commitment. This is what Huawen and others wish to promise ourselves and dare to tell the people of the whole country.

Huawen and others also have something to tell our people and the officers and soldiers of the Chiang army: Since Chiang Kai-shek launched the reactionary civil war, although he has the support of American imperialism and decades of ruling foundation, he has ultimately suffered repeated defeats because he politically betrayed the nation and the people, and militarily implemented erroneous strategic guidance, excluded dissidents, and acted arbitrarily. In the past two years, he has lost three million troops. Even though he now defends important cities with heavy troops, he still struggles to ensure their security. The fact that Jinan was captured by the People's Liberation Army in only eight days, and the 100,000 defending troops were completely annihilated, is a clear example. The trend of the people's hearts, the general trend of the situation, the victory of the People's Liberation Army is inevitable, and the defeat of the Kuomintang is inevitable. Brothers, officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, you should know that it is already unjust for us to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary civil war. If we make futile resistance and meaningless sacrifices, it will be even more unwise. In the past, in the Lunan Menglianggu Campaign, the entire 74th Division was annihilated and Zhang Lingfu was killed in battle; in the Laiwu Campaign, Li Xianzhou was captured; in the Xiangfan Campaign, Kang Ze was captured; Huo Shouyi in ＠zhou and Wang Yaowu in Jinan successively stubbornly resisted and waited for reinforcements, but they could not avoid becoming prisoners. During the fierce battle in Jinan, three army corps were gathered on the outskirts of Xuzhou, but they never dared to move forward. It can be seen that in the face of the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, any resistance is ineffective, and Chiang Kai-shek's talk of reinforcements is nothing but lies to deceive people. Therefore, the result of the battle is either death in battle or capture, with almost no exceptions. So, what is the way out for the officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army? The only way out is to revolt and join the People's Liberation Army, repent of past mistakes, and seek to atone for our crimes. If we can resolutely do this, we will surely gain the understanding of the people.

Since Huawen and others launched the uprising, we have received generous treatment from the People's Liberation Army and responsible authorities from all sides, and the people in the liberated areas have also been able to understand and warmly welcome us. This kind of sincerity and benevolence shown by the liberated areas from top to bottom is truly moving. The fact that Huawen, with his deep sins and repeated mistakes in the past, can still receive such treatment, further proves the consistency of words and deeds of the CCP and the People's Liberation Army and the sincerity of their lenient policies. Chiang Kai-shek's various threatening words are enough to expose his absurd clumsiness and the despicable mentality of shameless deception.

Huawen and others believe that the matter today is already very clear: taking the anti-communist and anti-people road and being loyal to the Chiang Kai-shek clique will inevitably lead to a tragic end of ruin and disgrace; taking the people's road and reforming ourselves will not only avoid unnecessary sacrifices, but also be understood and welcomed by the people, and regain the opportunity to serve the people. It is not difficult to decide which way to go. Huawen and others have given deep thought to the overall situation and future prospects when resolutely launching this uprising. Whenever we think of the past, our hearts are filled with remorse, and when we look to the future, we are filled with excitement. We sincerely hope that this sincerity can be understood by the people of the whole country and chosen by the officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army.

Wu Huawen, Commander of the Reorganized 96th Army and Commander of the Reorganized 84th Division, Yang Youbai, Commander of the Reorganized 155th Brigade, Zhao Guangxing, Commander of the Reorganized 161st Brigade, He Zhibin, Commander of the Independent Brigade of the Reorganized 96th Army, respectfully bow.

September 25th

　　吴化文将军等通电全国各界
  　服从中共领导打倒蒋匪统治
  　促国民党军官兵起义走向光明
    【新华社华东二十一日电】济南战役中在战场起义的整九十六军军长吴化文等，顷向全国各界发表通电，全文如下：
    陈司令员、饶政委、张副司令员、粟副司令员、谭副政委转人民解放军朱总司令暨全国各界同胞、国民党军全体官兵均鉴：
    自倭寇入侵，全国燃起抗日烽火，化文等于抗日初期，奋起御侮，并无二致。嗣受蒋贼曲线救国政策所愚弄，丧失民族立场，铸成大错。抗战胜利以后，人民创巨痛深，乃复昧于大义，重受蒋贼欺蒙，参加反共反人民内战，一错再错，罪孽弥深，清夜扪心，惭悔交迫。爰于九月十九日率全体官兵，在济南战场，毅然起义，图能力赎前失，走向光明大道。今后誓当站在人民立场，坚决拥护中国共产党主张，服从中共中央毛主席、朱总司令与华东诸军政首长领导，在人民解放军的统一号令下，为坚决驱逐美国帝国主义的侵略势力，为彻底打倒国民党反动统治，完全解放中国人民而忠诚奋斗。凡人民解放军宣言所载之各项基本政策，举如打倒蒋介石独裁政府；成立民主联合政府；惩办内战罪犯；肃清贪官污吏；没收官僚资本；发展民族工商业；废除蒋介石统治之独裁制度，实行人民民主制度；废除封建剥削制度，实行耕者有其田之土地制度；否认蒋介石卖国外交；承认境内各民族平等自治等项，皆系中国人民之迫切要求，与救国救民之最好途径，化文等必当奉为圭臬，引为准绳，鞠躬尽瘁，永矢不渝。此则化文等所愿以自许并敢告于全国人民者。
    化文等更有愿为我全国人民及蒋军官兵告者：蒋贼自发动反动内战以来，虽有美帝支援及数十年统治基础，终因政治上出卖民族，背叛人民，军事上实行错误的战略指导，排除异己，一意孤行，不得不迭遭溃败。两年以来，丧师三百万。迄今虽以重兵防守各重要城市，亦苦于不能确保。济南仅在八日之内即为人民解放军攻克，十万守军全军覆没，即为明例。人心所向，大势所趋，解放军必胜，国民党必败之形势，盖已定矣。国民党军官兵兄弟，应知我辈参加蒋贼反动内战，已属不义，若再作无益之抵抗与无谓之牺牲，更为不智。往者鲁南孟良崮战役，七十四师全军覆没，张灵甫战死；莱芜之役，李仙洲被俘；襄樊之役，康泽就擒；＠州霍守义、济南王耀武先后守城顽抗待援，但均不免于作阶下囚。济南苦战时，徐州外围囤集三个兵团，始终未敢前进一步，可见在人民解放军强大功势面前，任何抵抗均属无效，而蒋贼增援之说，无非谎言欺人。故作战结果，非战死即就俘，殆无例外。然则国民党军官兵之出路果何在乎？惟一出路，即为起义加入人民解放军，痛改前非，以求将功赎罪。果能毅然出此，必能得人民之谅解。
    化文等在举义以来，备受人民解放军及各方负责当局之宽待，解放区人民亦能曲予谅解，热烈欢迎。解放区上下此种相见以诚与人为善之胸怀，实足令人感动。以化文过去之罪孽深重，错误重重，犹能获得如此待遇，更足证明中共与人民解放军言行一致及宽大政策之真诚，而蒋贼种种威胁之词，适足暴露其荒谬拙劣与无耻欺骗之卑劣心理。
    化文等认为今日之事，已甚显明，走反共反人民道路，为蒋贼集团效忠，则必然招致身败名裂之悲惨结局；走人民道路，改过自新，则不仅可以避免无谓之牺牲，且可受到人民的谅解与欢迎，重新获得为人民服务之机会。何去何从，不难决择。化文等此次断然起义，对于大局与前途，实经深思熟虑。每念既往，五内交煎，瞻望将来，立增感奋。甚愿此种披肝沥胆之诚，能为全国人民所共谅，并为国民党军官兵所拣择也。
    整编九十六军军长兼整编八十四师师长吴化文，整编一五五旅旅长杨友柏，整编一六一旅旅长赵广兴，整编九十六军独立旅旅长何志斌同叩。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　九月二十五日
