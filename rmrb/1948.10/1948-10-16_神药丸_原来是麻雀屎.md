In Cheng Village, Third District of Jiyuan, the middle peasant Zhang Zerong's yard had an elm tree. There was a bowl-sized pit at the base of the tree. The tree was hollow, and there was a hole in its trunk from which water constantly flowed (some people called this the elm tree "crying"). This water flowed directly into the small pit. There was also a millstone in the yard. One day, Zhang Zerong's mother came to use the millstone and saw a pit of water at the base of the tree. She had been suffering from sore eyes (though they were almost healed), so she casually scooped up some of the water and washed her eyes with it. Because the large elm tree shaded the area, preventing sunlight year-round, she felt a coolness after washing. She then began to spread the word that the water was "miracle water" and "could cure diseases." As a result, neighbors and relatives all came to see it. Zerong's aunt, a sorceress, amplified the rumors even further. Gradually, people began to seek the "divine medicine" and offer prayers. The method for seeking the medicine was as follows: light a handful of incense, fill a bowl with cold water, scoop up some water from the small pit, and then move the bowl back and forth over the incense smoke, heating the bowl. A layer of white foam would then settle at the bottom of the bowl. The sorceress Zerong's aunt would say, "This is the divine medicine."

One day, the sorceress saw a red speck fall on the ground under the tree and said, "There is a living immortal in my tree! Look, it can even produce medicine! This medicine came from my tree!" Once this happened, the news spread like wildfire, and more and more people came seeking treatment and medicine.

Village cadres reported this to the district. Upon learning of this, the district cadres specifically waited at the entrance of Zerong's house to explain to those seeking treatment and medicine: "This is superstition and will not work." However, no one believed them. Some people, fearing trouble with the cadres, secretly entered through the back door. The cadres felt that simply stating the facts was not enough and that they needed to understand the truth. They carefully studied what the "medicine" was. They lit a handful of incense, filled a bowl with cold water, and heated the bowl over the incense smoke. A layer of white foam settled at the bottom of the bowl, just like the medicine the sorceress provided. It turned out that the water contained alkali, and when the water was heated, the alkali would settle at the bottom of the bowl, which was a very ordinary occurrence. This matter was clarified. But what were the red specks? They carefully examined the "medicine pills" from the sorceress. Someone said, "They look like radish seeds." However, comparing them to radish seeds, they were not quite the same. Chewing them, they made a crisp, cracking sound, whereas white radish seeds were soft and did not make such a sound. They searched everywhere for something similar. Guo Zixuan, the village militia director, saw similar red seeds on hackberry trees and plucked a few to compare with the sorceress's medicine pills. They were exactly the same. Chewing them also produced a crisp, cracking sound. However, they still couldn't figure out how hackberry seeds could end up under the elm tree. Someone said, "I keep seeing gray sparrows eating that stuff!" This reminded everyone that it was actually sparrow droppings.

After clarifying the nature of these two things, they announced that the "divine medicine" was fake. They also showed everyone the hackberry seeds. An old woman curiously asked them what it actually was. Just then, a gray sparrow defecated on the old woman's grape trellis. The cadre pointed and told her, "Look, 'divine medicine' has fallen on your grape trellis too!" The old woman ran over, burst into laughter, and deliberately said, "Look! I have a living immortal on my grape trellis too!" Following this, the cadres held a mass meeting to show everyone the hackberry seeds, explaining that they were hackberry seeds eaten by gray sparrows and then defecated under the tree. They also demonstrated the incense and water bowl method again, explaining what the white foam at the bottom of the bowl was. With this explanation, everyone understood. They said, "So that's what it was!" Those who had sought the divine medicine also regretted it, saying, "If I had known it was sparrow droppings, I would never have eaten it; it makes me sick just thinking about it now!"

　　“神药丸”原来是麻雀屎
    济源三区程村中农张泽荣家院里，有一株榆树，树根前地上有碗口大的一个小坑，树空了，树身上有一个窟窿，时常往下流水（有人叫这是榆“树哭”），这水就正好流在小坑里；这院里还有一盘磨。有一天，张泽荣他娘来套磨，看见树根前小坑里有一坑水，正好她闹的眼疼哩（可是已经快好了），就随手撩着那水把眼洗了洗。因为这大榆树遮着这里一年四季不见太阳，她洗了以后就觉着凉凉的，她就宣传起来了，说这水是“神水”，“能治病”。这样一来，邻居本家都来看，泽荣家婶婶是个神婆，传说的更厉害。慢慢的就有人来求神拜药；拜药的办法是：拿上一把香点着，用碗舀上些凉水，再把小坑里的水舀上一点，拿住碗在香烟上来回圪转，把碗薰的热了，在碗底下就沉着一层白沫。神婆泽荣婶说：“这就是神药。”
    有一天，神婆看见树底下的地面上落了一个红颗颗，就说：“我这树上有了活神仙啦！看，还能下药哩！这不是我树上下来的药！”这事一发生，一传十，十传百，从此来看病求药的人越多了。
    村干部报告到区上，区干部知道了，专门等在泽荣家门口，给来看病求药的人解释说：“这是迷信，不会顶事。”可是没人相信。有些人怕干部跟他麻烦，偷着从后门进去了。干部们觉着硬说也不是个办法，非把道理闹明白不行。他们就细细研究这求来的药到底是啥东西，他们也照样点着了一把香，用碗舀上些凉水，在香烟上薰，碗薰热了，碗底上也沉了一层白沫，跟神婆求的药是一样。原来这里的水里有碱性，水烧热了，碱就沉到碗底上去了，是很平常的一回事儿。这件事情闹明白了。可是那红颗颗又是啥东西呢？他们把神婆的药丸拿来仔细看，有人说：“象是萝卜籽”。把萝卜籽拿来一比，又不大一样。用咀咬咬，咯崩咯崩的响，白萝卜籽是绵的，咬起来不响。他们就到处寻找跟这相象的东西，村武委会主任郭子轩看见构桃上有这种红籽籽，就摘下几颗来，跟神婆的药丸比了比，一模一样的；放在咀里咬一咬，也是咯崩咯崩的响。可是还想不通“怎么构桃籽能到了榆树底下呢？”有人说：“我不断看见灰麻雀吃那个东西！”这一下把大家提醒了，才想到原来是灰麻雀屙下的屎。
    他们闹清楚了这两种东西，就宣传说：神药是假的。还拿出构桃籽籽叫大家看。一位老太太很奇怪的问他们，那到底是啥东西？这时候正有一只灰麻雀在这老太太的葡萄架上屙了一堆屎，干部就指着告她说：“你看你那葡萄架上也下来神药了！”老太太跑去一看，哈哈大笑，故意说：“看呀！我葡萄架上也有了活神仙啦！”接着干部就召开群众大会把构桃籽籽拿给大家看，说明了是灰麻雀吃下构桃籽又屙在树底下的。又用香跟水碗照样表演了一回，说明碗底下沉的白沫是啥东西。这样一闹，大家的思想都打通了。说：“原来是这呀！”求过神药的人也后悔的说：“早知道是麻雀屎，说啥我也不吃它；现在想起来还恶心哩！”（太岳通讯）
