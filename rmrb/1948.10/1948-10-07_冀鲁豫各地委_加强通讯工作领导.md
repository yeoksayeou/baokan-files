[Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Dispatch] News communications work on the south bank of the Yellow River is rapidly recovering due to the active leadership and promotion of local Party committees. Before July, communications in the area were inconvenient due to harassment by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, and very few people wrote articles. After July, the Second District Committee convened a meeting of communications cadres, reviewed the erroneous thinking of not writing articles after Party rectification, and clearly decided: (1) Writing articles is a concrete service to the Party and the people, therefore, it is necessary to delve into work and report conscientiously, opposing "empty talk." (2) Restore the communications organization. Establish communications groups in districts, and comrades from the sub-committees should participate as leadership backbone. (3) Establish close contact with the office at the same level to understand the overall situation and organize timely reporting. In addition to restoring the branch office, the Third District Committee also arranged and discussed communications work at the county secretary joint meeting. Various districts of Chengwu County discussed and determined to establish communications groups with work teams as units. When problems are discovered in the work, they should be raised immediately for everyone to study and write articles. The Fifth District Committee has also begun to promote and lead communications work in various counties, and formulated key reporting points. Especially during the political offensive, Dingtao, Qibin, Heze, Kaocheng, Dongming and other counties have made arrangements for communications work. When the Dongming County Committee arranged communications work, it specifically criticized the past bias of simply writing about advantages, writing about cadre activities, not writing about the opinions of people from all walks of life on our implementation of policies, and not writing about shortcomings. District offices of the Third and Fifth District Committees are now officially submitting articles to the Henan General Branch of the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Branch of the Xinhua News Agency. Due to the development of the work, the number of articles received from various places has greatly increased.

　　冀鲁豫各地委
    加强通讯工作领导
    【冀鲁豫电】黄河南岸的新闻通讯工作，由于当地党委积极领导推动，目前正迅速恢复。七月前，该地因蒋匪军骚扰，通讯不便，写稿者极少。七月后，二地委召开了通讯干事会议，检讨了整党后不写稿的错误思想，明确决定：（一）写稿是具体的对党对人民的一种服务，因此要深入工作，认真报导，反对“客里空”。（二）恢复通讯组织。区建立通讯组，分委同志要参加，作为领导骨干。（三）和同级办公室取得密切联系，了解全面情况，及时组织报导。三地委除恢复了支社外，并在县书联席会上对通讯工作作了布置和讨论。城武县各区讨论确定了以工作组为单位，成立通讯小组，在工作中发现了问题，马上提出，大家研究，写出稿件。五地委也对各县通讯工作开始进行推动和领导，拟定报导要点。尤其在政治攻势中，定陶、齐滨、菏泽、考城、东明等县，对通讯工作均有布置。东明县委会在布置通讯工作时，具体批驳了过去单纯写优点，写干部活动，不写各阶层群众对我执行政策的意见，不写缺点的偏向。三、五地委区各地现均正式向冀鲁豫分社河南总支社发稿。由于工作开展，各地来稿数量大增。
