Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: TASS reports: On the morning of September 22nd, the UN General Assembly elected the vice-presidents of the Assembly. The seven countries elected were the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China (Kuomintang), Poland, and Mexico. Parisian newspapers, in commenting on the election of the chairmen of the various committees on the 21st, revealed that the results of the American and British bloc excluding the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries from being elected had produced a sense of frustration even among many representatives who docilely followed the United States, fearing that this "not allowing the Soviet Union to occupy a position of honor, attacking them from the first day, is not a clever start" (New York Herald Tribune), and would cause adverse effects in world public opinion. On the afternoon of the same day, the General Assembly's Steering Committee began discussing the draft agenda for the General Assembly. Some proposals that ran counter to the principles of the UN Charter were included on the agenda, but the discussion of the agenda proved what goals those countries that controlled the majority of votes were pursuing. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, in his speech, firmly opposed including the reports of three illegal organizations, namely the so-called Interim Committee (or "Little Assembly"), the Balkan Committee, and the Korean Committee, which violated the Charter and in which the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries refused to participate, on the agenda. Vyshinsky pointed out that the discussion of these issues would be fraught with serious consequences because it would lead to the destruction of the very foundations on which the survival of the United Nations depended. When discussing the proposal put forward by the Argentine representative, namely that all countries applying to join the United Nations could be allowed to join the United Nations if they obtained a seven-vote majority in the Security Council, Vyshinsky pointed out that this proposal directly violated the Charter, which stipulates that applications for membership from new member states can only be recommended for acceptance if they obtain the consent of seven members of the Security Council, including the unanimous vote of the five permanent members. The arguments put forward by Vyshinsky from a legal and political point of view were so powerful that even Spaak and Evatt did not support the proposal of the Argentine delegation. Another motion proposed by the Argentine representative, namely to convene a general assembly to revise the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council, was barely passed with a majority of one vote after Vyshinsky's exposure.

    指委会讨论议程
    苏代表坚决反对把三个非法组织的报告列入议程
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社报导：九月二十二日上午，联大全体会议选出了大会的副主席，苏、美、英、法、中（国民党）、波兰及墨西哥七国当选。巴黎各报于评论二十一日选举各委员会主席时透露：美英集团排斥苏联及新民主国家当选的结果，甚至在许多驯服追随美国的代表中也产生了沮丧的影响，害怕这种“不让苏联占一名誉位置，从第一天起就攻击他们，这是不高明的开端”（纽约先驱论坛报），将在世界舆论中引起不利的影响。同日下午，大会指导委员会开始讨论大会的议程草案。一些与联合国宪章原则相背驰的建议，虽均被列入议程，但议程的讨论，证明了那些控制多数票的国家正在追逐着什么目的。苏代表团团长维辛斯基在发言中坚决反对将违背宪章的和苏联与东欧国家拒绝参加的所谓临时委员会（或谓“小型大会”）、巴尔干委员会、朝鲜委员会三个非法组织的报告，列入议程。维辛斯基指出，这些问题的讨论将充满严重的后果，因为它是导向联合国存亡所系的基础之破坏。当讨论阿根廷代表所提建议，即一切申请参加联合国之国家在获安理会七票多数赞成即可准许加入联合国时，维氏指出：这一建议直接违反宪章，宪章规定新会员国之入会申请只有在获安理会七理事国的同意，包括五常任理事国的一致票时，才能被推举接受。维氏从法律与政治观点提出的论据如此有力，甚至使斯巴克与伊瓦特都不支持阿根廷代表团的建议。阿根廷代表提出的另一议案，即提请召开大会修改安理会大国一致原则的建议，亦在维氏揭露下仅以一票的多数勉强通过。
