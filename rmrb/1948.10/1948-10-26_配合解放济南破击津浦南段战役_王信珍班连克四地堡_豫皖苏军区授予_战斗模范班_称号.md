　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 23rd: The headquarters and political department of the Yu-Wan-Su Military Region recently jointly issued a circular commending the sixth company's Wang Xinzhen squad of a certain regiment and awarded them the honorary title of "Combat Model Squad." During the Jinpu Railway disruption campaign in coordination with the Jinan Campaign, the Wang Xinzhen squad continuously captured four bunkers, seizing four carbines, twelve Thompsons, and four machine guns. They completed their mission without any casualties and strictly adhered to battlefield discipline and policies. In the battle to capture the Jiagou railway station on the Jinpu line on the night of September 13th, the squad was ordered to eliminate the outer bunkers northwest of the eastern ticket office and clear out the enemy, who outnumbered them several times. After receiving the order, Wang Xinzhen and his squad studied the enemy's situation, terrain, and attack routes, determined the combat deployment, and divided the squad into two combat groups, led by himself and the deputy squad leader respectively. After the attack began, Wang Xinzhen directed the entire squad to quickly engage the enemy with courageous actions, directly assaulting the bunkers. Wang Xinzhen himself used a submachine gun to block the bunker's firing holes, ordered the squad to throw grenades into the bunker's firing holes, and simultaneously led shouts to conduct on-the-spot political offensive. Ten minutes of combat led to the surrender of a squad from the fourth company of the sixteenth traffic police regiment, and the bunker was occupied. At this point, the entire squad took the newly captured six American-style submachine guns and quickly advanced, utilizing their superior firepower to seize the second bunker. Thus, they occupied the enemy's northwest corner of the forward position. The squad then coordinated with neighboring units to continue fighting and attack the third bunker. Wang Xinzhen chose the gap between the enemy bunker's two firing holes as the assault route, and taking advantage of the interruption in enemy fire, cleverly led the entire squad to seize the third bunker, also scaring away the enemy in the fourth bunker. The heroic and resourceful Wang Xinzhen squad thus occupied the enemy's four bunkers without any casualties. After the battle, Deputy Commander Zhang of the Yu-Wan-Su Military Region personally visited Wang Xinzhen, inquired in detail about the squad's combat experience, and pointed out the strengths of Wang Xinzhen's command: resourcefulness and flexibility, ability to choose battle opportunities and capture the enemy's weaknesses, good at organizing manpower and firepower, and maintaining control of the entire squad under any circumstances. The military region's political department also issued instructions calling on participating troops to learn from the Wang Xinzhen squad. A certain regiment also organized instructors and political instructors from various battalions and companies to visit the Wang Xinzhen squad and study the squad's combat experience. The second platoon of a certain company invited the Wang Xinzhen squad to participate in the platoon's combat review meeting, comparing the Wang Xinzhen squad's experience in capturing bunkers with the fifth squad's failure to complete its mission due to being suppressed by enemy fire, to educate everyone. Wang Xinzhen is from Yidong County, Shandong, 21 years old, and joined the army in 1946. He joined the Communist Party of China in August 1947.

　　配合解放济南破击津浦南段战役
  　王信珍班连克四地堡
  　豫皖苏军区授予“战斗模范班”称号
    【新华社中原前线二十三日电】豫皖苏军区司令部、政治部，日前联合通令嘉奖某团六连王信珍班，并授以“战斗模范班”的光荣称号。王信珍班在配合济南战役的津浦线破击战中，连克地堡四座，缴获卡宾枪四支、汤姆十二支、机枪四挺；无一伤亡而完成任务，且严格执行战场纪律与政策。该班于九月十三日夜攻克津浦线上夹沟车站战斗中，奉命扫除东部票房西北之外围地堡，肃清该地数倍于我之敌，王信珍于受命后，与全班战士研究敌情地形与攻击道路、规定战斗部署、将该班分为两个战斗小组，与副班长分别带领。攻击开始后，王信珍指挥全班以勇猛动作迅速接敌，直扑地堡。王信珍自己以冲锋机枪封锁地堡射击孔，命令全班将手榴弹从地堡射击孔中掷入，同时领导喊话，进行火线政治攻势。十分钟的战斗就使守敌交警十六总队第四中队之一个班放下武器，将该地堡占领。这时，全班拿上刚缴获的六挺美式冲锋枪迅速前进，发挥优势火力，强占了第二座地堡。至此，乃占领了敌西北角前沿阵地。该班旋即配合友邻部队，继续作战，攻击第三座地堡。王信珍选择了敌地堡两射击孔的间隙，作为冲锋道路，利用敌火力中断的时机，机警地率领全班夺取了第三座地堡，也吓跑了第四座地堡的敌人。英勇机智的王信珍班，遂以无一伤亡而占领了敌人四座地堡。豫皖苏军区张副司令员于战后特亲访王信珍，详询该班战斗经过，指出王信珍指挥的长处：机警灵活、能选择战机捕捉敌人弱点、善于组织人力火力、并在任何情况下不失对全班的掌握。军区政治部亦发出指示，号召参战部队向王信珍班学习。某团也组织各营连教导员，指导员访问王信珍班，研究该班战斗经验。某连二排曾请王信珍班参加该排战斗检讨会，将王信珍班攻夺地堡的经过，与该排五班因受敌火力压制而未完成任务的情况作对比教育大家。按王信珍系山东沂东县人，二十一岁，一九四六年参军。一九四七年八月参加中国共产党。
