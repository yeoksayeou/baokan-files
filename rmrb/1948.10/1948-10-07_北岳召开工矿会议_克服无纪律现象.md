　　North Yue Holds Work and Mining Conference
　　Overcome Lack of Discipline
　　[North Yue Electric] The Industry and Commerce Department of the North Yue Administrative Office convened an expanded cadre meeting of various industrial and mining enterprises on the ninth of this month. Attendees included administrative, party affairs, and trade union accountants, technicians, and skilled workers from factories and mines. The conference lasted for ten days. After conveying the resolutions of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, a preliminary review of the industrial and mining enterprises in the North Yue area was conducted. The main shortcomings in the past were: (1) Blind, unorganized, and unplanned leadership, without investigation or research, only proceeding from subjective wishes, not valuing science and technology, and narrow-minded empiricism. For example, the Lingshan Xiaoxipo mine wasted a lot of resources because the location of the mine was chosen incorrectly due to inaccurate planning and surveying. (2) Organizational formalism, regardless of the size of the factory, there were always factory directors and deputy directors or managers and deputy managers, in addition to supervisory committees, secretaries, section chiefs, correspondents, service personnel, and other large setups. For example, the Lihua Woolen Mill could have been run well with a dozen employees, but now it has 23 employees, and other places also have this tendency. (3) The operation and management were very chaotic, the division of labor was unscientific, responsibilities were unclear, there was no mutual communication, and everything was grabbed at random. For example, the technology team leader of the Lingshan Coal Mine could change the engineering plan, and the cook could instruct workers to carry water. The accounts within the factory were chaotic. For example, the Lingshan Coal Mine and Lihua Factory had no settlement accounts for several months, and there was no fixed system or procedure for the receipt and expenditure of raw materials. Raw materials were purchased regardless of price or importance, resulting in a large backlog of some raw materials and a shortage of others, which affected production. After discussion, everyone recognized the above shortcomings and errors, which caused great losses to the development of industrial and mining enterprises and the people's property in the North Yue area. It was clarified that the only task of the factory in the future is production, to learn science and technology, and to learn factory management methods, in order to achieve the goal of enterprise. Furthermore, in accordance with the "Draft Factory Management Regulations" and other documents of the North China Conference, and in connection with actual conditions, various work systems, factory regulations, and labor (work) discipline drafts were formulated, and work rules and leadership relationships were discussed, specifically clarifying the work responsibilities and scope of each employee. Everyone believes that to move towards enterprise, it is necessary to start with the following points: (1) Rectify the organization, carry out scientific division of labor, clarify responsibilities, establish unified and centralized leadership, implement the factory director responsibility system, and overcome the state of indiscipline and anarchy. (2) Establish and improve various strict management systems, implement accurate cost accounting, strengthen cost accounting, establish attendance and work assessment daily report systems, etc. In addition to hierarchical inspections, an inspection team led by technicians should be organized, with clear rewards and punishments, to improve the labor efficiency of employees, save raw materials, and cherish tools. (3) Make reasonable adjustments to wages.

　　北岳召开工矿会议
    克服无纪律现象
    【北岳电】北岳行署工商厅于本月九号召开各工矿业扩大干部会议，到会者有工厂矿山行政、党务、工会会计、技师技术工人等。大会共进行了十天，传达了华北工商会议的决议后，对北岳区工矿事业作了初步的检查，过去的缺点主要是：（一）领导上盲目无组织无计划，不调查不研究，只是从主观愿望上出发，不重视科学技术，狭隘的经验主义。如灵山小西坡矿井因为计划勘测不精确，把矿井的位置选择错了耗费很大。（二）组织上机关化，不分厂的规模大小，就设正副厂长或是正副经理，此外还设有监委、秘书、科长、通讯员、勤务员等一大套，如丽华毛织厂本来有十几个职员就能办好，可是现在职员竟达廿三个，别的地方也有这偏向。（三）经营和管理上很乱，分工不科学，职责不明确，互不联系，乱抓一把。如灵山煤矿技术班长就可改变工程计划，伙夫都可指使工人担水，厂内帐目混乱。如灵山煤矿丽华工厂都是几个月全没有结算帐目，原料的收支没有一定制度和手续，购买原料也不管贵贱，也不分哪个要紧与否，致有的原料积压很多，有的则很缺，影响了开工。经讨论大家都认识了以上这些缺点和错误，给予北岳区工矿事业发展与人民资财上以很大损失，明确了今后工厂唯一的任务是生产，要学习科学技术，学习管理工厂方法，以便达到企业化的目的。更根据了华北会议“工厂管理草案”等文件联系实际订了各种工作制度厂规劳动（工作）纪律草案，并讨论了工作细则及领导关系，具体明确了各职员的工作职权和范围。大家认为要走向企业化还必须从以下几点着手：（一）整顿组织进行科学分工，明确职责树立统一集中的领导，施行厂长负责制，克服无纪律无政府状态。（二）建立与健全各种严格的管理制度，施行精确的成本核算，加强成本会计等，建立考勤考工日报等制度，除逐级检查外，并以技师为主的组织检查组，奖惩严明，以提高职工劳动效率，节省原料，爱护工具。（三）对工资加以合理调整。
