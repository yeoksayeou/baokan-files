　　Science Serving the People
    ——Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Nikolai Tsitsin
    One day I browsed through the autobiographies of many people, and what surprised me was that almost every one of them had a more or less identical background.
    “...I was born in the countryside, the son of a peasant...”
    “...My father was a worker...”
    “...I am the daughter of a poor peasant...”
    “...My parents worked as hired laborers for a landlord...”
    I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened to them if there had been no Soviet revolution. Who among them could have achieved anything in the world?
    Under socialism, these people have become scientists. They all work in the Grain Research Institute that I lead. In total, the institute has more than one hundred researchers, almost all of whom come from worker or peasant backgrounds.
    My senior assistant, Alexei Lagulin, who leads a laboratory in the institute, is the son of a sugar refinery worker. The learned secretary of the institute, Dmitri Goliunov, was born forty-three years ago in a small village in the northern borderland forests. Another laboratory leader, Grigory Lazhenchenko (who recently brilliantly defended his dissertation to earn a scientific degree), is the son of a Ukrainian poor peasant.
    The Soviet state provides them with salaries, allowing them to conduct research fruitfully. After graduating from the academy, they get jobs according to their abilities and aspirations.
    If anyone were to ask who my parents were, I would give a similar answer: my father was a carpenter, and my mother always worked as a washerwoman for the wealthy families in Saratov, a large city on the Volga River.
    My father died in 1898, shortly after I was born. In her exhausting labor, my mother didn't even earn a kopeck. All she got from the rich masters was three meals a day for her and me. But when I grew a little older, she was even denied this "charity."
    I was only five years old then. I was placed in a nursery for poor children, where the only method of education was relentless beating. I couldn't bear such abuse and ran away three times, but each time I was caught and beaten again.
    At the age of thirteen, I began to make a living for myself. My first job was in a handicraft workshop. Later I became a telegraph operator. As for studying, that was just a dream.
    After the Soviet revolution, I joined the Red Army to fight against the enemies of the young Soviet republic, defending with arms the right to education for millions of poor children like me. This right, now guaranteed by our constitution, is enjoyed by all Soviet citizens.
    If it were not for the Soviet revolution, our thousands upon thousands of scientists today would never have reached their current positions—only a few would have managed to get an education.
    Tsarist Russia had many famous scientists, people who made boundless contributions to world science and human knowledge. They were either the descendants of the bourgeoisie, or individual geniuses who achieved academic heights through extraordinary effort and sacrifice.
    The great plant breeder I. V. Michurin was such a born genius. I met him in 1926, when the Red Army sent me to study at a college in Saratov, where I was also taking courses for workers to enter university. When I set off with a group of classmates to visit Michurin, I resolved to devote myself to studying science and had just begun to think about developing new varieties of plants.
    I will never forget that visit. The great scientist and his wise advice led me onto the correct path of research.
    "Don't wait for the favors of nature," he said. "Our task is to seize the favors of nature."
    I dedicated myself to the task of creating new plants. This research requires endless patience and labor before achieving any definite results, and it brings many disappointments and failures.
    In 1927, after graduating from an agronomy research institute, I worked as a researcher at the Volga Agricultural Experimental Station, where I soon got the opportunity to engage in independent research.
    I chose common wheat. This is the food on which most of the world's population relies. The long, golden grains of common wheat are the result of centuries of struggle between man and nature. It is well known that humans have been growing wheat for more than 4,500 years, but humanity has yet to obtain a perfect variety of wheat. Modern wheat is like a coward: heat and frost often put it to death; it is susceptible to various diseases, it needs good soil, and it requires great effort in cultivation.
    I determined my goal: I wanted to develop a new variety of wheat by hybridizing the delicate wheat varieties cultivated by people with the strong, wild plants.
    Similar to wheat varieties is a plant called couch grass, in Latin AGROPYRUM, literally meaning "field fire," which is familiar to every farmer. Given the slightest opportunity, this thing will spread throughout the field and suffocate all planted crops, its thick, dense roots are the farmer's bane.
    Couch grass is not picky about its environment at all—any soil is suitable for it to grow, as long as there is something for its roots to grab onto. Heat and frost do not scare it at all.
    I wanted to hybridize this conqueror of the field with excellent wheat. According to my estimation, the two would produce excellent offspring. This was an adventure into a new realm. One cannot be certain of a definite result, and in any case, these results would only be apparent after many years. Besides, quite a few Soviet scientists disagreed with my opinion.
    But in a socialist country, the development of science does not become a source of private profit as it does in capitalist countries; the government provides assistance to all scientific pioneers.
    In 1935, I was invited to participate in an All-Union Congress of Wheat Growers, Tractor Drivers, and Combine Drivers, attended in person by the leaders of the Party and the government. I was given the opportunity to speak, and I spoke from the podium of the Kremlin Conference Hall about my experiments.
    When I finished speaking, Joseph Stalin invited me to the presidium.
    Stalin asked me how I was conducting my work, what my working conditions were, and whether anything was hindering my research.
    When we finished talking, he said:
    "You must bravely do your experiments. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. We will support you."
    Shortly afterward, I managed a research institute near Moscow. We expanded the scope of our research and, after countless experiments, obtained several entirely new types of wheat.
    Wheat is annual. Couch grass is perennial. When we hybridized them, we got a wheat that is also perennial. This wheat is of good quality and, more importantly, does not need to be planted every year. After harvesting, it grows back like turf grass, and it can have a good yield for at least three years. The ears of wheat are larger than ordinary wheat. Each plant has more stalks of wheat. This wheat flour has better taste and nutrients. When perennial wheat takes its rightful place in the land, it will cause a great revolution in agriculture.
    This day is not very far off. Perennial wheat has not yet appeared on collective farms. We are still studying its characteristics on experimental farms, but the first perennial wheat No. 34085 has already been tested on hundreds of acres of land on collective farms in Kazakhstan.
    Perennial wheat is completely new in the plant kingdom, and of course, people will still do more research before getting satisfaction. I am convinced that the most intense activity in this regard will be carried out in the Soviet Union. Here, the development of science is closely linked to production.
    Highly developed Russian science has always been at the forefront of the times and has always been closely linked to the social thought of its era. Russian scientists have never confined themselves to narrow specialized research, but have striven to link their work with the search for new ways in the struggle to improve human life. But the dream of making all the achievements of science serve the people was only realized after the Soviet revolution.

　　为人民服务的科学
    ——苏联科学院会员  尼柯莱·齐金
    有一天我浏览了一下很多人的自传，使我吃惊的是几乎他们每个人的出身多多少少都是相同的。
    “……我生于乡间，是一个农民的儿子……”
    “……我的父亲是一个工人……”
    “……我是一个贫农的女儿……”
    “……我的父母给一个地主当雇工……”
    我不禁怀疑到假若没有苏维埃革命，他们便会有怎样的遭遇。他们当中有谁在世界上能得到成就呢？
    在社会主义条件下，这些人们成了科学家。他们都是在我领导的谷物研究院里工作。总计起来这研究院共有一百多名研究员，几乎他们每个都是工人或农民的出身。
    我的高级助手，领导研究院某实验室的阿历克西·拉古林是一个炼糖厂工人的儿子。博学的研究院的秘书第米特里·郭里乌诺夫，四十三年前生于北部边疆森林中的小村庄里。另一个实验室领导人葛利高里·拉景琴柯（为了赢得科学学位他最近光辉地阐明了他的论文）是一个乌克兰贫农的儿子。
    苏维埃国家供给他们薪俸，使他们得以有成果地进行研究。他们在学院毕业后按照他们的能力和志愿得到工作。
    假若有人要问我的父母是谁，我将作类似的回答：父亲是一个木匠，母亲一向给伏尔加河上的大城——萨拉托夫的富户当洗衣妇。
    我的父亲死于一八九八年，是在我出生后不久。母亲在她精疲力尽的劳动中，甚至连一个哥贝克都没赚过。她从阔主人那里得到的只是她和我的三餐。但当我稍长大的时候，她甚至连这种“慈悲”也被拒绝了。
    这时我才五岁。我被安置在一个给穷孩子们住的养育院里，那里的唯一教育方法就是无情的鞭打。我忍耐不了这样的虐待，曾逃跑了三次，但三次都被抓回来，再次遭受着鞭打。
    在十三岁的时候，我开始为自己谋生活。我的第一个职业是在手工业作坊。后来我当了电报员。至于学习那只是做梦。
    苏维埃革命后我加入了红军与年轻的苏维埃共和国的敌人作战，手持武器来保卫千百万象我似的穷子女享受教育的权利。这种现在为我国宪法所保证的权利是全体苏联公民所享受的。
    假若不是因为苏维埃革命，今天我们成千累万的科学家即将永达不到他们现在的地位——只是少数可设法获得教育罢了。
    沙俄有许多著名的科学家，他们是对世界科学和人类知识作了无限贡献的人们。他们或者是资产阶级的子孙，或者是付出惊人的努力和牺牲达到学术高峰的个别的天才。
    伟大的植物育种专家Ｉ·Ｖ·密邱林便是这种生来的天才。我在一九二六年遇到了他，那时红军把我送到萨拉托夫的一个学院去学习，我在那里还学着工人进大学用的课程。当我与一群同学出发去访问密邱林的时候，我立志专心学习科学，而且刚刚想到发展植物新品种上来。
    我永远忘不掉那次访问。这位伟大的科学家和他的贤明的劝告把我领到正确的研究道路上来。
    “不要等待自然的恩惠，”他说：“我们的任务是要夺取自然的恩惠。”
    我把我自己贡献给制造新植物的工作上。这种研究工作在达成某种肯定的结果以前，要求无限的耐心和劳动，而且它会带来许多失望与失败。
    一九二七年，我在一个农学研究院毕业之后，我在伏尔加农业实验场当研究员，在那里不久我便得到一个从事独立研究的机会。
    我选择了普通小麦。这是世界大部人口所赖以生活的食料。普通小麦的长长的金黄色的颗粒，是许多世纪来人与自然斗争的成果。尽人皆知，人类种麦已有四千五百多年历史了，但人类仍未得到一种完善的麦种。现代的小麦象是一个懦夫：热与霜经常置它于死命；它容易受到各种病害，它需要好土壤，需要在耕种时给予极大的努力。
    我确定了我的目标：我要用人们所栽培的娇弱的麦种和野生的强壮的植物杂交来发展一种新麦种。
    与小麦品种类似是人们称为茅草的植物，拉丁语叫ＡＧＲＯＰＹＲＵＭ字义为“田火”，是每个农民所熟悉的。这种东西稍一得到机会就会蔓延整个田地并且窒死所有种植的植物，它的厚密的须根是农人的毒害。
    茅草对环境一点也不挑剔——任何土壤都适于它生长，只要是有为其草根所抓住的东西。热和霜一点也恐吓不了它。
    我想用这个田地上的征服者与优良的小麦杂交，据我的估计，这两个会生出优异的后代来。这是一种走入新境界的冒险。人们不能确定有一定的结果，然而无论如何，这些结果只有在许多年后才会表示出来。除此之外，有不少的苏联科学家是不同意我的意见的。
    但在社会主义国度里，发展科学并不象在资本主义国家里那样成为私人利润的源泉；政府对所有科学的开路先锋给予帮助。
    一九三五年，我被邀参加一个全苏联的种麦者、拖拉机驾驶员与康科因驾驶员大会，党与政府的领袖也亲自出席。我被给予了发言的机会，我在克里姆林宫会议大厅的讲台上讲述了关于实验的事情。
    当我讲完时，约瑟夫·斯大林邀我到主席团去。
    斯大林问我怎样进行工作，我的工作条件怎样，是否有什么阻碍了我的研究。
    我们谈完话时他说：
    “你要勇敢地做你的实验。不要怕出错误。我们将支持你。”
    以后不久，我管理一所莫斯科附近的研究院。我们扩大了研究范围并在千万次的实验之后获得了数种性质全新的麦种。
    小麦是一年生的。茅草是多年生的。我们使它们杂交就得到一种也是多年生的小麦。这种小麦质量好，更重要的是不需要每年都种了。在收割之后，象芽草一样地又生长出来，而且至少在三年内都可有很好产量。麦穗比普通小麦大。每棵有更多的麦秸。这种麦粉有更好的滋味和养分。当多年生的小麦在土地占到自己应有的地位时，它将造成农业界的大革命。
    这个日子不很远了。多年生的小麦迄今还未在集体农庄里出现。我们仍然在实验农场里研究它的特性，但是地面上第一个多年生小麦第三四○八五号已在哈萨克斯坦的集体农场数百英亩土地上试验过了。
    多年生的小麦在植物界里完全是新东西，当然人们在得到满意以前仍将作更多的研究。我深信人们对此所作的最紧张的活动将在苏联进行。这里，科学的发展是与生产密切联系着的。
    高度发展的俄国科学始终走在时代的前端，并始终与它的时代的社会思想紧密联系着。俄国科学家从不把他们自己局限于狭隘的专门化的研究当中，而是力求将他们的工作与在改善人类生活斗争中探求新的道路这一点联系起来。但使科学的一切成就为人民服务的梦想只有在苏维埃革命以后才得到实现。
