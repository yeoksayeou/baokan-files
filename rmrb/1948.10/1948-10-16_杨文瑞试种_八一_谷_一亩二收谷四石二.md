　　【Taiyue Telegram】Yang Wenrui of Wenmin Village, Yangcheng, achieved a great harvest from his trial planting of "August 1st" millet seeds. This year, he planted a total of 1.2 mu, which grew evenly and strongly, yielding a total of 420 jin. His neighbors planted local millet varieties on land of similar quality, but the "August 1st" millet was stronger from the start. The result was a yield eight dou less per mu for the local millet. In addition, the "August 1st" millet planted by Tan Guoting's group in Hexi Village also yielded well, with 280 jin harvested from 0.8 mu. The masses in Dongfeng and Gulong said that the advantage of "August 1st" millet is not only its high yield but also its prickly awns, which prevent rats and sparrows from eating it. After this harvest, many people in Wenmin Village exchanged grain seeds with Yang Wenrui.

　　杨文瑞试种“八一”谷
  　一亩二收谷四石二
    【太岳电】阳城文敏村杨文瑞试种“八一”谷种收成很大。他今年共种了一亩二分地，长的又齐又壮，这次共收四石二斗。他的邻地种的是本地谷，地好坏差不多，但从小就不如“八一”谷壮实，这次收的结果，每亩少打八斗。另外河西村谭国廷组种“八一”谷收成也好，八分地就收了二石八斗。董封、固隆群众说：“八一”谷的好处不但收成多，而且因有刺毛，灰鼠和麻雀不敢吃。这次收后，文敏村许多老百姓都向杨文瑞换谷种。
