Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning, 16th. The Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning Office of the Northeast Administrative Committee issued a proclamation on the 10th of last month, stipulating regulations for the development of livestock. The proclamation first pointed out that in recent years, the number of livestock in various parts of the region has sharply decreased due to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' looting, slaughter and sale during disaster periods, starvation, and deviations in the implementation of policies during land reform and production. This has hindered agriculture, transportation, and the economy of the people in pastoral areas. In order to restore and develop livestock, the following provisions are specifically made:

	1. It is forbidden to collect livestock and livestock hides from Mongolians or Han people. If organs or troops violate the ban and collect them without authorization, the people have the right to refuse payment.
	2. It is strictly forbidden to slaughter working livestock (including draft animals, female animals, and small animals). All old, infirm, and unusable livestock can only be slaughtered with the approval of the district government.
	3. It is forbidden to export female animals and working animals (including draft animals). However, free buying and selling are allowed within the liberated areas, and no restrictions shall be imposed. If there are special reasons for exporting livestock, a special export permit must be issued by the provincial government or higher-level administrative office before export is allowed.
	4. People's working livestock, in addition to serving in accordance with the war service regulations, are strictly forbidden for troops and organs to seize and use livestock casually. If there is any illegal seizure and use, the people may appeal to the government, and if it is found to be true, it will be severely punished.
	5. In order to develop working livestock, new livestock purchased by the people from the date of the proclamation shall be exempt from war service for half a year as a reward.
	6. It is permissible to hire workers for grazing and management, and wages shall be determined by both parties.
	7. Farmers and self-herding households with livestock should improve livestock feeding and management, and universally implement autumn grass cutting, repair of barns, and construction of winter shelters.
	8. In order to strengthen winter livestock epidemic prevention and medical treatment, Chinese and Western veterinarians who voluntarily open pharmacies but have difficulties may request assistance from the government. All Chinese and Western veterinarians or livestock epidemic prevention personnel who voluntarily serve the development of livestock shall register with the government, and the government above the county level shall assign work and give preferential treatment.
	9. When livestock epidemics occur, isolation and disinfection must be implemented to avoid infection. Livestock that die from epidemics must be burned or buried deeply, and eating and selling are prohibited.
	10. Protect pastures and strictly prevent fire. It is forbidden to throw fire in pastures. Those who burn pastures shall be punished. Winter pastures shall be preserved and shall not be trampled on at will. Without government approval, no reclamation shall be allowed within pastoral areas.
	11. Regular comprehensive mass wolf-beating campaigns shall be held in pastoral areas, and local troops and organs shall actively participate and do their best to help solve difficulties.
	12. The government will reward those who have achieved results in raising livestock. Areas with insufficient livestock may request the government to solve the problem in a planned manner. The use of working livestock in pastoral areas is prohibited, and those already in use should be restored.
	13. People may plant alfalfa in large quantities. Those who have difficulties with seeds may request government assistance. Existing alfalfa fields should be protected and expanded.
