Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 15th. Now that it is late autumn, how to plan to increase production by one inch next year is the top priority for leading party, government, military and civilian organs in the liberated areas. Some experiences in the production planning movement currently underway in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area can be used as reference for various regions. Some areas in Jin-Sui have already formulated one- or two-year production development plans based on different conditions, stipulating that they will start from improving planting, developing sideline occupations, increasing livestock, mutual aid in labor exchange, building water conservancy projects, and reclaiming wasteland. The method of formulating the plan is to first formulate the village plan, and then formulate the plan for the entire district and the entire county. Before formulating a production plan, Fucun Village in Daixian conducted a thorough survey of the general production situation in the village, and then calculated the village's income, general living standard expenditures, surplus labor, and insufficient livestock power. Based on this, it formulated a production plan for the next two years, stipulating that it would increase fertilization, promote cotton planting, restore tobacco workshops and oil mills, and develop transportation teams and textiles. It is estimated that each person can increase the production of refined grains by four dou per year. Villages such as Dujia Sha＠ in Shenfu simultaneously planned and pooled shares for transportation, and conducted experiments at the same time. Within three days, they pooled 5 million yuan and 10 livestock to run foot transportation, obtaining great profits. This method of planning and experimenting at the same time is most easily accepted by the masses. All localities are being warned when formulating plans not to repeat the old problem of being unrealistic and becoming a mere formality. Some places also have the shortcoming of plans lagging behind reality. For example, the Fourth District of Linxian could have completed the task of planting 60,000 mu of wheat, but only planned to plant 30,000 mu of wheat. The Fourth District of Lishi only reported the existing production statistics to the higher authorities as a plan, without planning how to improve the existing production level. The Third Sub-district Commissioner's Office pointed out: This is a bias of "seeking no merit, but seeking no demerit," which must be overcome in the future.

### 争取明年生产水平提高一寸　晋绥各地订生产计划

　　争取明年生产水平提高一寸
  　晋绥各地订生产计划
    【新华社晋绥十五日电】现在已是秋末了，如何计划明年把生产提高一寸，这是解放区党政军民领导机关的当前头等任务。晋绥解放区现正进行的制订生产计划运动的某些经验，可供各地参考。晋绥有一部分地区已经根据不同的情况，订出了分别从改良种植、发展副业、增加牲畜、变工互助、修建水利、开垦荒地等方面着手的一年或两年的发展生产的计划。订计划的方法是先订好村的，再订全区的，全县的。代县富村在订生产计划之前，先周密调查全村一般生产情况，从而计算出全村收入、一般生活标准的支出及劳动力剩余、畜力不足等，然后据以订出今后两年的生产计划，规定增加上肥、提倡种棉、恢复烟坊、油坊、发展运输队和纺织等，约计每人每年可增产细粮四斗。神府杜家沙＠等村一面订计划集股运输，一面进行试验，三日内集股五百万元及牲口十头出发跑脚，获得大利，这种一面计划、一面试验的办法，最容易为群众所接受。各地订计划时都被警戒着不要重犯不切实际而流于形式主义的老毛病。也有些地方发生计划落后于实际的缺点，如临县四区原可完成种麦六万亩的任务，可是只计划了种麦三万亩。离石四区只将现有生产统计向上级报告作为计划，而不计划如何把现有的生产水平提高一步。三分区专署指出：这是“不求有功、但求无过”的偏向，今后须加以克服。
