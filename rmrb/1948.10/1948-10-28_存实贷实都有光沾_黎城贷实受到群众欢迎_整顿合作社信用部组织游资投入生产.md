　　【Taihang News】The entire Taihang area is currently swept up in a surge of rectifying cooperatives to ensure "real deposits, real loans" in response to Chairman Mao's call to carry out a second organization. According to a report from the Licheng "Lending in Kind" Working Group in Taihang: Land reform in the Taihang area has been thoroughly completed, the feudal exploitation system has been eliminated, and peasants have obtained land equivalent to the average amount. Turning to full-scale production is our central task. However, the lack of production capital is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Based on our understanding from fifty days of work: (1) Livestock: In Xihuangxu Village, there are 3,442.12 mu of land and 91 head of livestock, with each head averaging 37.82 mu. Dongbei has 4,718.25 mu of land and 96 head of livestock, with each head averaging 49.15 mu. Tinghepu has 3,684.7 mu of land and 101 head of livestock, with each head averaging 36.48 mu. According to the general situation in Licheng, each head of livestock can cultivate 25 mu of land. (2) Fertilizer: Dongbei uses an average of 13 loads per mu of wheat land, Tinghepu uses 18 loads, and Tinghe uses 13 to 15 loads. In addition, there are two brick and tile kilns and two oil presses that are not operating. This illustrates the lack of production capital.

　　In the past, production loans in various regions solved many problems, but they are no longer applicable today. They must be replaced by lending in kind to meet the current needs. The reasons are: (1) Due to the gradual rise in prices in recent years, although the amount of production loans has continuously increased, the actual effect has gradually diminished, reducing the strength of support for production. For example, Wang Guishu in Xihuangxu Village borrowed 50,000 yuan, which could be exchanged for 6 shi and 2.5 dou of rice at the time of the loan, but only 5 dou of rice when repaid, a ratio of 100 to 8. That is to say, 100 yuan loaned out was now worth 8 yuan, and the bank or cooperative credit department lost 92 yuan. If this approach is not changed, the people will suffer a great loss. The reason why this approach was not changed in the past was due to our muddled thinking of unilaterally taking care of the interests of a few loan recipients, a one-sided mass perspective, and a lack of the concept of accumulating capital to expand reproduction. (2) In the future, if we want to organize the masses' financial and material resources and idle funds, strengthen production funds, and improve agricultural production even by an inch, we must ensure the full realization of the principle of benefiting both parties, otherwise funds will be lost and no deposits will be attracted. (3) Implementing lending in kind can overcome the speculative behavior of some lazy people in the past. They used to borrow money but not engage in production, instead buying grain with the loan and storing it. When it was time to repay the loan, they would only sell part of the grain to repay the principal and interest, and the rest of the grain would be obtained without labor in this way. (4) Only by implementing lending in kind can we stimulate mutual lending among the masses, invigorate rural finance, and overcome stagnation.

　　**Publicize Policies, Dispel Doubts, Allow Deposits and Withdrawals at Any Time, and Distribute Dividends on Schedule**

　　When we began to publicize lending in kind, the masses responded: "Farmers are all about farming and producing grain. There is no loss in depositing, withdrawing, lending, and repaying grain. No matter how prices rise or fall, we still return one dou for one dou, one shi for one shi, so what are we afraid of!" "There is no loss in depositing or lending. Grain is stored at home anyway. Depositing it in the credit cooperative can support production, earn some interest, exchange old grain for new grain in the circulation process, avoid rats and insects, and turn dead assets into living assets." "Depositing when we have it, borrowing when we need it, is a good way to solve difficulties." However, a few individuals said: "Isn't storing grain for future distribution the same as confiscating the shares of landlords and rich peasants in the cooperatives!" Some said: "It's good, but I'm afraid the credit won't be good and we'll lose money." "It's like sending food into a tiger's mouth," or "Wang Laoer sending a candlestick, never to return." Others were afraid of increasing their burden by storing grain. In general, the majority approved, while a minority opposed. The objections can be summarized into two types: (1) Fear of using inappropriate personnel, resulting in losses and loss of credit. (2) Fear of policy changes, leading to future confiscation or increased burdens.

　　Regarding the fear of using inappropriate personnel, resulting in losses and loss of credit, we repeatedly explained in branch meetings, cadre meetings, mass meetings, during meals, and in individual discussions that in the future, the personnel of the cooperatives would be democratically elected. The conditions were strong management skills, high technical skills, integrity, reliability, and enthusiasm to serve the masses. We also explained that the grain deposited, loaned, and recovered by our credit department is always in kind, ensuring no losses. The credit department also retains some deposited grain specifically for payments, and can also use it as operating capital or transportation capital, generating profits from operations and transportation to cover all internal expenses and interest payments. Regarding the fear of future confiscation and increased burdens, we repeatedly explained that the farmers' stored grain had already been used to pay the agricultural burden according to regulations and would definitely not be used again. Cooperative shares are distributed dividends and deposits earn interest, which were not burdened in the past and will not be burdened in the future. The confiscation of landlords' and rich peasants' shares during past movements was a deviation in policy implementation. After correcting the policy, villages that had rectified these errors had returned the shares to the original owners, and our policy will not change. It is not a living thing, but a deviation in execution, and we will never make the same mistake twice in the future. After resolving the above two issues, responsible cadres from each village provided guarantees of credit, ensuring that depositors could deposit and withdraw freely, shareholders would receive dividends on schedule, and those in need would receive lending in kind to solve their difficulties. After everyone deliberated, those who were more accepting boldly declared their intention to invest and deposit grain, but because the credit department had not truly achieved credit in the past, some people were afraid to believe boldly and adopted a tentative attitude, depositing only one or two dou to see what would happen. Others were still hesitant and watching.

　　Currently, in four villages, 77 households have deposited grain and 13 households have invested shares, totaling 74 shi and 7.5 dou of fine grain (Shuanghe dou, equivalent to 144 shi and 9.5 dou of market dou). In three villages, 8 households have borrowed to buy livestock, borrowing 16 shi and 6.6 dou. Three households have borrowed 5 shi for small business vending. Three households have borrowed to buy fertilizer (not including Tinghe), borrowing 1 shi and 7.9 dou. A total of 24 shi and 9.5 dou of grain have been lent out (Shuanghe dou, equivalent to 49 shi and 9 dou of market dou).

　　Based on the situation of fifty days of work, we feel it is necessary to raise the following points for attention:

　　1. While understanding the situation, it is necessary to decide on a policy of organizing mass idle funds in addition to loans from the state bank (which is indispensable), as it is also necessary today. Then, identify the main difficulties in mass production, and it must be accurate.

　　2. Lending in kind must open up the thinking of party members, cadres, and the masses, and at the same time rectify the cooperatives and transform the credit departments. The cooperative must have members; it cannot just be vaguely called a cooperative. Commercial production, etc., must have a planned organization of production to find a way out for mass production and solve practical production difficulties.

　　3. Good or bad credit and good or bad production organization are the basic keys that determine whether credit operations can be carried out. For example, when mobilizing for collective grain storage in Tinghepu, many men and women said: "If we can truly do a good job of storing and lending grain, that would be the best thing. But I'm afraid the credit won't be good." This shows that as long as credit is guaranteed in the future and free deposit and withdrawal are ensured, then increasing investment and grain storage will not be a problem. At the same time, as long as production is well organized and ways to make money through production are found for the masses, the masses will inevitably feel the lack of production capital, and issuing goods in kind will not be a problem.

　　The shares and grain storage of the credit department must not be issued to the outside completely, but must be retained as operating capital or to organize mass transportation capital. Profits earned in operations or transportation can be used to make up for the gap and solve expenses, while also handling payments and ensuring credit.

　　4. Implementing lending in kind can prevent lazy people from misusing loans. In these four villages, no lazy person applied for a loan in fifty days. Because if they don't work hard, they won't be able to keep up and won't be able to repay, so many loans were issued to genuine laborers, becoming true production loans in name and in fact. Honest farmers only borrow when they need it and repay when they don't, which is also a good way to prevent loans from being accumulated and wasted and allows for flexible circulation.

　　However, when grain prices rise or fall, close attention must be paid to those who try to exploit loopholes. Because our approach is to facilitate the masses to borrow and repay at any time, some people will take advantage of the situation by borrowing currency at a price converted at a high price when prices rise and repaying when prices fall, thereby profiting from the price difference. (But it is also necessary to prevent it from going to the other extreme: that is, collecting loans from the masses when prices rise—Editor)

　　5. Regarding the issue of barter trade: According to preliminary understanding, in rural areas, wages in mutual aid teams and weaving teams, as well as transactions of certain daily necessities, are all calculated in kind (some have always had barter trade, but it has increased since the Anti-Japanese War). Even when using currency, it is based on the standard of calculation in kind. No matter how much you say that barter trade is a regression and backward, objective conditions inevitably dictate it. Therefore, barter trade is not a development caused by lending and borrowing in kind. On the contrary, rural grain storage appearing in the market for circulation can also stabilize grain prices. On the other hand, increased organization of transportation can also reduce the price difference between regions. In this regard, changing currency loans to lending in kind is all beneficial.

　　存实贷实都有光沾
  　黎城贷实受到群众欢迎
  　整顿合作社信用部组织游资投入生产
    【太行讯】现整个太行正卷入整顿合作社贷实存实的热潮，以响应毛主席的号召，进行第二个组织起来。据太行黎城贷实工作组报导称：太行区土地改革已经彻底完成，封建剥削制度已经消灭，农民均获得了相当于平均数的土地，全面转向生产是我们的中心工作。但生产资本缺乏，是当前急须解决的问题。根据我们最近五十天工作的了解：（一）牲口，西黄须村地三四四二·一二亩、牲口九十一头，每头平均耕地三七·八二亩。董北有地四七一八·二五亩，牲口九六头，每个牲口平均耕地四九·一五亩。停河铺有地三六八四·七亩，牲口一○一头，每头平均耕地三六·四八亩。而按黎城一般情况，每头牲口可耕地二十五亩。（二）肥料，董北每亩麦地平均十三驮，停河铺十八驮，停河十三驮至十五驮。另有砖瓦窑两座、油坊两座没开。这说明了生产资本是缺乏的。
    过去各地进行生产贷款，曾经解决了不少问题，但现在已经不能适用。而必须代之以实物借贷，才能适应当前需要。理由是：（一）由于几年来物价逐渐上涨，生产贷款数量虽不断增加，实际作用逐渐缩小，减少了扶植生产力量，如西黄须村王贵舒贷款五万元，贷时折米六石二斗五升，还时折米五斗，成为一百与八之比。这就是说，原来贷出一百元，现在值八元了，银行、合作社信用部赔了九十二元。如不改变这种作法，人民是会吃大亏的。过去所以没有改变这种做法，是由于我们有片面的照顾少数贷款户利益的糊涂思想，片面的群众观点，而却没有积累资本扩大再生产的观念。（二）今后要想组织群众财力物力及游资，壮大生产资金，解决生产资本的困难，使农业生产提高一寸，必须保证两利原则的完全实现，否则资金赔累，吸收不到存款。（三）实行实物借贷，能克服过去某些懒汉的投机取巧。他们过去贷上款不生产，把贷款买成粮食放起来，将来还款时只把粮食出卖一部就可以本利还清贷款，其余一部粮食就在这样情况下不劳而获。（四）只有实行实物借贷，才能掀起群众间互相借贷，活泼农村金融，克服死滞现象。
    宣传政策打破怀疑随存随取按期分红
    我们开始进行贷实的宣传时，群众反映的是：“庄稼人都是种地打粮食的，存粮、取粮、贷粮还粮都不吃亏，任凭物价上涨下落，我们一斗还是一斗，一石还是一石，怕啥！”“存贷都不吃亏，粮食在家也是放着，存到信用社能扶植生产，能多少得点利息，能在周转中把旧粮换成新粮，能免除鼠咬虫吃，能把死物变成活物。”“有了就存，用着能贷，这是解决困难的好办法。”但也有个别群众说：“把粮存起来将来平分时还不是和没收地富合作社股金一样！”有的说：“好是好，就怕信用搞不好，赔钱。”“这是往老虎嘴里送食。”或“王老二送灯台，一去不回来。”还有的怕因存粮增加负担。总的说来，赞成的是多数，反对的是少数。反对意见综合起来也有两种：（一）怕用人不适当，赔本失信用。（二）怕政策改变，将来给没收了，或增加负担。
    对于怕用人不适当赔本与失信用问题，我们反复的在支部、干部、群众大会上及饭场和个别酝酿交谈中说明，今后合作社的人员由民主选举，条件是经营能力强、技术高、为人忠实可靠、热心为群众服务，并说明我们信用部存入粮、贷出粮、收回来还是粮，总是实物，保证不会赔钱的。信用部另外还留一部存粮，专门应付支付，同时利用他还可作经营资本或运输资本，从经营运输当中获得利润来解决内部一切开支与空息问题。对于怕将来没收与增加负担问题，再三说明农民的存粮因已经由农业负担按规定出了负担，决不能再出，合作社入股分红，存实得利，过去不负担，将来仍然不负担，过去在运动中没收地富的股金是执行政策当中发生了偏差，经过端正政策，进行了纠偏的村庄，都已退还原主，咱们的政策是不会变的。也不是活的，而是执行当中的偏差，今后决不会一错再错。经过解决以上两问题后，由各村负责干部提出保证信用，确实作到存实者随存随取、入股者到期分红、困难者贷实解决。经过大家酝酿之后，接受较好者大胆自报入股、存粮，但因过去的信用部没有确实作到信用，使部分人不敢大胆相信，采取试探的态度，少存入一、二斗。看将来怎样，有的还在犹豫观望。
    现在四个村存粮者七十七户，入股者十三户，共计细粮七十四石七斗五升（双合斗，合市斗一百四十四石九斗五升）。三个村贷，实买牲口者八户，贷十六石六斗六升。作小买卖担挑者三户，贷五石。买肥者三户（停河没计算在内），贷一石七斗九升。共计贷出粮二十四石九斗五升（双合斗，合市斗四十九石九斗）。
    根据五十天工作情形，我们觉得有必要提出以下几点注意：
    一、了解情况中就必需决定除国家银行贷款外（这是不可缺少的），还要组织群众游资（这在今天也是必要）的方针。然后找出群众生产的主要困难是啥，要找得准。
    二、贷实工作必须打通党员干部群众的思想，又必须同时整顿合作社、改造信用部。合作社必须是有社员的，不是笼笼统统叫个合作社，进行商业生产等，要有计划的组织生产，为群众生产找出路，解决生产实际困难。
    三、信用好坏和生产工作组织的好坏，是决定信用业务活动与否的基本关键。如在停河铺发动集实时，有好多男人女人这样说：“要真正搞好存粮贷粮，这是再好也没有了。就怕信用搞不好。”这说明在今后只要保证了信用，确实作到存取自由，那么，增加入股，存粮是不成问题的。同时只要组织好生产，为群众找下生产赚钱出路，群众就必然感到生产资本的缺乏，发放实物也就不成问题。
    信用部的入股存粮决不能扫数向外发放，必须留存一部做经营或组织群众运输资本。在经营或运输中获得利润弥补空隙，解决开支，同时应付支付，保证信用。
    四、实行实物借贷能够防止懒汉乱用贷款。这四个村五十天就没有懒汉来贷款。因为不加紧劳动就赶不上，还不起，这样就拿出好多款来贷到真正的劳动者之手，成为名符其实的生产贷款。而老实农民他是用着才贷，用不着了就还，这也是使贷款不致积压浪费能灵活周转的好办法。
    但在粮价上涨或下落时，要严密注意某些人钻空子取巧。因为我们的作法是为了便利群众随贷随还，因之他就在物价上涨时按物折价贷走货币，物价下跌时来偿还，从中讨取物价差额便宜。（但也必须防止偏到另一边：即物价上涨时向群众收贷——编者）
    五、关于以物易物问题：根据初步了解，在农村中互助组、纺织队的工资偿付、及某些日用品交易，群众都是以实物计算（有些固然是历来就有以物易物的情形，但自抗战以来是增多了），就是使用货币也是以实物计算为标准，任凭你说以物易物是倒退的，落后的，但客观形势必然如此。因之，以物易物并非因实物贷借而发展。相反的，农村储粮出现在市场上流通还可平抑粮价。另一方面由于组织运输增多又可缩小各地物价的差额。在这方面，改货币贷款为实物借贷，都是有好处的。
