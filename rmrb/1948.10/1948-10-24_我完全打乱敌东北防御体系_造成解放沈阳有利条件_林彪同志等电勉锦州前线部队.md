Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: Following the great victory of the Jinzhou Campaign, Commanders Lin, Luo, Liu, and Tan sent a special telegram to all commanders and fighters of the units that bravely stormed the enemy positions and blocked reinforcements, stating: "In the Jinzhou Campaign, we have achieved a complete victory. This victory is due to the heroic and swift actions of our attacking Jinzhou troops, who, after 31 hours of fierce fighting from the start of the general offensive, completely annihilated the Jinzhou garrison, creating a brilliant example of rapid and decisive annihilation warfare in our army's siege battles. Our reinforcement-blocking troops stubbornly resisted the enemy's fierce reinforcements of six divisions from south to north, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, preventing them from advancing further, and ensuring that our attacking Jinzhou troops had ample time to prepare for the siege, thereby increasing the inevitable conditions for capturing Jinzhou. This victory is great, giving the enemy a heavy blow, completely disrupting the enemy's defense system in the Northeast, and creating favorable conditions for our army to liberate Changchun and liberate Shenyang. We hope that all units will continue to fight bravely, annihilate the enemy, win continuous victories, and strive for the liberation of the entire Northeast. Glory to our heroic comrades who sacrificed themselves!"
