　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. Autumn harvest has generally begun in all parts of the Northeast Liberated Areas. This year's autumn crops, except for a few areas, generally have an 80% yield. Although southern Manchuria counties suffered from drought during spring plowing and summer hoeing, thanks to the government's vigorous leadership in helping the masses engage in production for self-salvation, they finally achieved a harvest unseen for many years. The crops in Caohekou District, Benxi County, are the most abundant in fifteen years. The district's grain harvest is enough to feed the entire district for two years. Corn yields are generally around six to seven *shi* (one *shi* equals 500 *jin*). In Changfa District, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, the highest corn yield can reach twelve *shi* per *héctare* (ten *mu*). Sorghum yields are similar to corn. The best soybeans can yield eight to nine *shi*, and the least four to five *shi*. In Yanshou and Bin Counties, Songjiang Province, the rice yield per *héctare* can reach about twenty *shi* due to timely sowing and careful weeding. In the past, rice ears had a maximum of 130 grains, but this year they have 180 grains. This year's autumn harvest is due to the leadership organs at all levels grasping ideological mobilization and preparatory work, universally achieving harvesting, pulling, threshing and storage to prevent wind, frost, and cold from affecting the harvest. In Beixing District, Keshan County, Heilongjiang, nearly 5,000 *héctares* have been harvested out of 13,000 *héctares* of autumn fields, and it is estimated that the entire harvest will be completed by the end of October. Regarding the issue of mutual aid organizations, all localities have accepted the failed experience of large groups last year, corrected the phenomenon of forced orders, and organized small labor exchange groups under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. For example, in various villages in Bayan County and the ninth district of Wuchang County, autumn harvest groups are organized with households as the unit. Due to mutual aid in the autumn harvest in the Xihai District of Wanfu County, Andong, over a thousand *héctares* of corn in the entire village were harvested in two days. Women in various places are widely organized to participate in peeling corn, digging potatoes, and cutting sorghum ears. In Xinsheng Village, Shuangcheng County, more than three hundred women out of over four hundred households participated in the autumn harvest. In Sifangtai District, Suihua County, 5,000 women went to the fields to split corn, and one-third of the district's 3,000 *héctares* of corn have been split. During the autumn harvest, various localities responded to the call of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Zhenglan Wutun in Shuangcheng County adopted a contracting method, with every two to two and a half laborers in the entire village bearing the responsibility of helping the families of soldiers harvest one *héctare* of land. Changfa District in Suihua County contracted the land to be cultivated on behalf of soldiers’ families to specific people, and the families of soldiers designated the time for harvesting. During the autumn harvest, some areas also combined it with sending manure and autumn plowing, hauling back a cart of corn while bringing a cart of manure, and implementing the practice of plowing one *mu* after harvesting one *mu*.

　　东北紧张秋收一般八成年景
    【新华社东北十日电】东北解放区各地普遍开镰秋收。今年秋田庄稼除个别地区外，均有八成年景。南满各县在春耕夏锄时虽遭灾荒，但由于政府大力领导群众生产自救，终于获得多年未有之丰收。本溪县草河口区庄稼为十五年来罕有之丰稔，全区收获粮食足够两年吃用。苞米产量一般都在六七石（一石五百斤）左右，黑龙江省绥化县长发区苞米最高每垧（十亩）能打十二石。高粱收获量与苞米相近。黄豆最好的能打八九石，最少也有四五石。松江省延寿、宾县等地水稻，因播种及时薅苗细致，每垧产量可达二十石左右。稻穗往年最多一百三十粒，今年则有一百八十粒，今年秋收由于各地领导机关抓紧思想动员和准备工作，普遍做到随割随拉。随打随入仓，以防风苞寒霜，影响收成。黑龙江克山县北兴区一万三千垧秋田，已割出近五千垧，估计十月底即可全部收完。在互助组织问题上，各地均接受去年大组的失败经验，纠正强迫命令现象，在自愿两利原则下，组织小型换工组。如巴彦县各村及五常县九区，均以户为单位，组织秋收小组。安东万福县西海区由于互助秋收，两天时间，即将全村千余垧苞米收割完毕。各地妇女广泛的组织起来参加剥苞米、起土豆、割高粱穗等工作。双城县新胜村四百多户人家，就有三百多妇女参加秋收。绥化县四方台区有五千妇女下地劈苞米，全区三千垧苞米已劈三分之一。秋收中各地响应中共东北中央局关于优待军烈属的号召，双城县正蓝五屯采取包工办法，按全屯劳动力每两个至两个半人负担帮助军属收割一垧地。绥化县长发区把代耕地包给一定的人，由军属本人指定时间收割。在秋收中，有的地区同时结合送粪、秋耕，拉回一车苞米时捎去一车粪，并实行割一亩耕一亩。
