　　【Taiyue Dispatch】Although wheat is about to be completely planted in West Village, Tunliu Third District, the leadership is completely adrift. The recent village cadre meeting revealed that since the implementation of renewed voluntary association, most of the village is still composed of temporary work assignment groups that form today and disband tomorrow. Furthermore, women have not been included. Even when they are included, it is sporadic and unorganized, which leads to difficulties under the busy conditions of war service. This has affected wheat planting. They originally should have plowed more, but fearing being sent to war, they hurriedly planted. Some people also requested mutual aid, but there was no one to lead. Especially the women, who asked the cadres: "Are we still doing mutual aid this year? Working together is lively and we get more done." The cadres ignored them, thinking that less mutual aid meant less trouble. The meeting further examined the reasons: (1) It was because they mistakenly regarded the past bad practices of forced orders from the leadership as shortcomings and errors of the mutual aid groups themselves. Therefore, whenever mutual aid was mentioned, they thought of forced orders, wasteful meetings, etc., completely distorting the role and nature of mutual aid, and thus failing to see the benefits of voluntary mutual aid groups. Also, since the rectification of deviations, the masses were at ease with production, and with the good weather, production was seemingly good. Some people mistakenly thought that "production is better without mutual aid," so they abandoned leadership even more. (2) Some cadres neither recognized their own mistakes nor understood the Party rectification policy, so they were passive and inactive, thinking that it was better to do less than more. (3) Another group of people did not understand democracy and mistakenly thought that whatever the masses said was right, resulting in tailism. Therefore, they were hesitant and formed only daring to call, but not to lead. Except for Jia Baocun and Han Taishan, all other cadres in the village only promoted it at meetings or among the masses, without actually doing anything. After reviewing, everyone was determined to correct it and discussed methods for rectifying the mutual aid groups: on the one hand, publicize that the weather is getting cold and frost will come early this year, and that there might be war service tasks, so it is necessary to organize and launch a concentrated autumn tillage campaign. On the other hand, each cadre must go deep into leadership, first forming groups with people they get along with, using their own exemplary actions to promote mutual aid throughout the village. The original mutual aid groups should settle accounts, clear wages, and be restored and expanded. Everyone's spirits were high, and they said with confidence: there are ways to organize autumn tillage. As long as our cadres lead, it will get going.
　　Branch News Agency Note: The voluntary work assignment groups of the masses naturally have their shortcomings, such as unequal value and short duration, but they are welcomed by the masses, have a mass base, and are in line with the voluntary principle of organization. Therefore, the attitude towards them is not to kick them away, but to lead and transform them to be equal in value and long-term. The method of transformation must also be gradually improved from the personal experience of the masses, and should not be rushed. The West Village cadre meeting did not decide on a transformation plan for the original work assignment groups, but instead ignored the work assignment groups and organized something else. This method is inappropriate and has committed the problem of administrative orders, which should be thoroughly examined and corrected.

　　不管拨工组另来一套
    西村领导互助办法又错了
    【太岳电】屯留三区西村，虽然麦子即将种完，但领导上是完全自流的。最近村干会上检查出自从实行重新自愿结合至今，全村大部还是一些临时拨工小组，今天互助明天散伙。更没吸收妇女参加。即使吸收了也是零星的、没组织的，在战争勤务繁忙的条件下就发生了困难。这样就影响到种麦，原该多犁一遍，但怕要参战走，就赶紧种上了。有些人也要求互助，但没人领导。尤其是妇女们，就问干部：“咱今年还互助不？在一块做活又红火又多作活。”干部不管，反认为没互助少麻烦。会上就进一步检查原因：（一）是因为片面的把过去领导上强迫命令等坏作风，当作是互助组本身的缺点错误，因此一说到互助，就认为是强迫命令开会误工等等，完全歪曲了互助作用与性质，也就看不到自愿结合互助组的好处。又由于纠偏以后群众放心生产，又加雨水调匀，生产表面不错，有些人即误认为“不互助才闹好了生产”，所以更放弃了领导。（二）部分干部既不认识自己错误，又误会整党方针，因此消极不干，认为多一事不如少一事。（三）另一部分人不懂得民主，误认为群众说啥就是啥，尾巴主义，因此束手束脚，形成了只敢号召不敢领导。全村干部除贾保存、韩太山二人还敢领导外，其他干部只是在会议上或群众中宣传一下，不实际干。经过检讨后，大家决心改正，讨论出整顿互助组的办法：一面宣传今年地气温落霜早，又怕有参战任务，要组织起来突击秋垡，另一方面各干部要深入领导，先和说得来的人碰组，用自己的模范行动，来推动全村互助。原有的互助组清算帐目清理工资，恢复扩大。大家情绪很高，都有信心的说：组织秋垡有办法。只要咱干部一领导就起来拉。分社按：群众自愿结合的拨工小组，自然有它缺点，如不等价不长期等，但为群众所欢迎，有群众基础，亦符合于组织起来的自愿原则。因此对它的态度不是一脚踢开，而是领导改造，使它等价、长期。改造的办法也必须从群众的亲身经验中逐步去提高，不能操之过急。西村干部会上对原来的拨工小组没有决定改造方针，而是对拨工小组不管，另外组织，这种方法是不妥当的，又犯了行政命令毛病，应深入检查纠正。
