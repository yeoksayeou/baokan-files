Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 6th. The famous silk industry of Luxian County in western Henan is gradually recovering with the support of the democratic government. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the county produced 600,000 catties of silk annually, which sold well in Beiping, Shanghai, and Southeast Asia. The county had more than 3,000 silk weaving machines. There were more than 100 silk firms in the urban area alone, and silk firms were also commonly established in rural towns. During the rule of the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang bandit army, the county's silk industry suffered all kinds of destruction and was in a state of collapse. After the liberation of Luxian, silk production increased with the support of loans from the democratic government. This year, the silk production in the county's fourth district alone can weave 1,200 bolts of silk, which can be exchanged for 240 shi of wheat (320 catties per shi), which is the largest sideline income for the local people. On September 20, the democratic government specially convened experienced silkworm farmers to study the selection and purchase of silkworm eggs, in order to achieve greater development next year.

　　民主政府贷款扶助
    豫西鲁山丝产增加
    【新华社中原六日电】著名的豫西鲁山县蚕丝业，在民主政府扶助下已逐渐恢复。该县在抗战前每年产丝六十万斤，畅销北平、上海、南洋各地，全县有织绸机三千余架，城关一处即有丝行百余家，四乡集镇亦均普遍设立丝行。在敌伪及国民党匪军统治期间，该县蚕丝业备受百般摧残，一蹶不振。鲁山解放后，经民主政府贷款扶助，丝产职增。仅该县第四区今年丝产即可织绸一千二百匹，可换麦二百四十石（每石三百二十斤），为当地群众最大的副业收入。九月二十日，民主政府特召集富有经验的蚕户研究蚕种选购问题，以求明年有更大的发展。
