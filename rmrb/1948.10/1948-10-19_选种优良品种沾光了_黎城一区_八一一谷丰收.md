　　Benefiting from the Selection of Superior Varieties
  　The First District of Licheng
  　Abundant Harvest of "811 Millet"
    [Taihang News] This spring, the leaders of the First District of Licheng paid attention to promoting and advocating the popularization of superior varieties. With the personal assistance and guidance of comrades from the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, the "811 Millet" has yielded a bumper harvest this year, much to the satisfaction of the masses. Wang Yu of Dongguan planted 0.8 mu of "811 Millet" this year and harvested 2 shi and 2 dou and 4 sheng. Liu Wanheng's family in Zhaodian planted 0.35 mu and harvested 1 shi and 4 dou. An old man from the Xiaguihua Production Committee planted 1.2 mu and harvested 3 shi and 4 dou. Qi Sansan of Dongguan said: "The yield of '811 Millet' is high, and it can be harvested early to plant wheat, so we can harvest three seasons of grain in two years." Most of the 67 mu of "811 Millet" in Dongguan has already been replanted with wheat. Labor hero Gao Yu of Xiaguihua said during the field selection of seeds at the Production Committee: "As long as everyone pays attention, planting '811 Millet' can increase grain yield. This year, everyone paid attention to the technique when weeding, breaking the old practice of planting three seedlings in one hole. This year, the '811 Millet' was planted with one stalk per foot, leaving it sparse, so the grain yield was high, and everyone benefited. We should select more seeds this year." A model production team leader Jia said: "The '811 Millet' is strong, not afraid of wind, and the stalks are hard and resistant to wind, not afraid of falling down." Everyone said: "We should select more seeds during field selection this year and plant more next year."

　　选种优良品种沾光了
  　黎城一区
  　八一一谷丰收
    【太行讯】黎城一区领导上今春注意了发扬与提倡推广优良品种，又得农林局各个同志亲自帮助指导，今年“八一一谷”得到丰收，群众都很满意。东关王玉今年种八一一谷八分，打了市石两石二斗四。赵店刘万恒家种了三分半，打了一石四斗。下桂花生产委员会一个老汉种一亩二，打了三石四斗。东关齐三三说：“八一一谷收粮重，又能早收改麦，这样两年能收三季粮食。”东关六十七亩八一一谷，大部已改茬种了麦。下桂花劳动英雄高雨宽在生产委员会研究田间选种时说：“种八一一谷，只要大家注意就能多打粮。今年锄苗时大家都注意了技术，打破过去一步三按，一按三棵的老做法。今年八一一谷是一尺远一根，留的稀，因此收粮重，大家沾了光。今年还得多选一些种子。”模范生产队长甲说：“八一一谷子牢，不怕风磨，秆硬，抗风，不怕跌倒”。都说：“今年在田间选种时多选些，明年多种些。”
