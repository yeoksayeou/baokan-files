Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS, 28th: French Communist leader Duclos, speaking to over 5,000 listeners in Béthune (between Saint-Quentin and Amiens in northern France), sharply criticized the Queuille Plan. Duclos strongly stated that increasing taxes would not solve the budget imbalance because higher prices would further increase government spending. Duclos said: The government is giving preferential treatment to big capitalists because they are the main pillars of American imperialist expansionist policies. Duclos demonstrated that reducing military spending could save 200 billion francs. He praised the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal at the Third UN General Assembly. Finally, he called on the audience to promote unity of action, strengthen the struggle to establish a democratic and unified government capable of implementing a policy of national independence, freedom, and peace, and prevent the current government and its partner, de Gaulle, from selling France to American capitalists.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Paris: The left wing of the French Socialist Party has broken away from the Socialist Party, which is controlled by right-wing reactionary leaders, and formed the "Unified Socialist Party." The split within the Socialist Party is the result of the increasingly growing dissatisfaction within the party caused by its ruling group's adoption of reactionary policies. The "French Unified and Social Democratic Party Congress," formerly a component of the party, recently announced its separation from the Socialist Party and the establishment of the "Unified Socialist Party." Its first Steering Committee was elected on the 29th, with Blancourt as the party's General Secretary. The movement within the Socialist Party against its reactionary ruling group is expanding. The Socialist Party organization in Finistère (located at the tip of the Brittany Peninsula) openly opposes the Socialist Party's participation in the Queuille government. Many people, including Professor Paul Rivet, have announced their withdrawal from the Socialist Party parliamentary group. The Cannes (southern France, Mediterranean coast) Socialist Party branch recently unanimously resolved to "restore freedom of action, establish autonomous branches," and "denounce the party's reactionary ruling group for betraying the interests of the working people, betraying socialism, and betraying the policies of democracy and peace."

    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社二十八日讯：法共领袖杜克洛在贝隆尼城（在法北部圣昆敦与亚眠之间）向五千余听众演说时尖锐抨击葛义计划。杜克洛力称增加税收并不能解决预算的平衡问题，因为物价更加高涨的结果，又将使政府的开支增加。杜克洛说：政府宽免大资本家，因为他们是美国帝国主义扩张政策的主要支柱。杜克洛证明减少军费可以节省二千亿法郎。他赞扬苏联在三届联大中提出的裁军建议。最后他号召听众促进行动的统一，加强斗争以建立一个民主统一的、能够执行国家独立、自由、和平的政策的政府，阻止现政府及其合伙者戴高乐把法国出卖给美国资本家。
