Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th—The Kuomintang reactionaries are adopting methods of strengthening special agent control, attempting to salvage the crisis in their army. According to an Associated Press report from Nanjing on September 11th, the Kuomintang government's Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau has assigned special liaison officers to the battalion level and above in the army. An official said that at least 100,000 people under Deng Wenyi (the current Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense) have been assigned to various units of the Kuomintang army. These personnel "have their own system that is not under the jurisdiction of the regular National Army, and apparently perform duties without being subordinate to regular military commanders." The stated purpose is to "improve soldier morale," but the result has deepened the internal contradictions within the Kuomintang army, and "some officers have expressed grievances of 'spying on and restricting us.'"

　　国民党军加强特务控制
    妄图挽回衰颓士气
    【新华社陕北八日电】国民党反动集团正采用加强特务控制办法，妄图挽回其在军队中的危机。据美联社九月十一日自南京报导：国民党政府国防部政工局已派定特别联络官至军队营级及营级以上的部队中。一官方人士称：邓文仪（现国民党国防部政工局长）属下至少有十万人被指派至国民党军各部队。此项人员“拥有与正规国军不相统属的自己系统，且显然不隶于正规军事指挥官而执行职务”。其所宣布的目的为“改善士兵士气”，但其结果却反而更加深了国民党军队内部的矛盾，“若干军官已发出‘刺探与约束我们’的怨言”。
