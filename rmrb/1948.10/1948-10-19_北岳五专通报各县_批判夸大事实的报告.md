Beiyue Electric Dispatch: The Fifth Special District Office issued a circular on September 28, criticizing the undesirable practice of exaggerating figures in production reports from Dingxing County. For example, the summary report of Dingxing County's production work in September stated: "In the Fourth District, the father and son, Ying Yufeng, from Nanyingqiu Village, scraped eight cartloads of grass in two mornings." It did not specify what kind of cart, making it difficult to believe. Tang County's statistics showed that the area of wheat planted last autumn was 89,339.8 mu, while the report before the summer survey and collection was 54,321 mu, a decrease of 35,018.8 mu. The report from Wan County stated that thirteen waterwheels could irrigate more than 800 mu of land, an average of more than 60 mu per waterwheel. Under what circumstances could so much be irrigated? It was not made clear, and it was only after questioning that the mistake was discovered. The report on killing armyworms in Xushui in August stated: "The villages of Dongbailou, Xibailou, Changbao, Taibaoying, Baoying, and Caizhuang in the Eighth District were also eaten clean by armyworms. Statistics for the six villages totaled 5,649 mu." However, the pest survey table for the Eighth District showed that the most severely affected area (referring to the area eaten clean) was 2,027 mu out of the seventeen villages surveyed. The negative consequences of such report numbers are, at best, repeated inquiries and wasted time; at worst, incorrect policy decisions. The reasons for these phenomena are: First, some cadres have individualistic heroism and departmentalism, exaggerating their work achievements in an attempt to make a splash, and their attitude is not honest. The Industry Department's report on the acreage of wheat and cotton planted is often higher than the Finance Department's report on the acreage of wheat and cotton fields collected. The Industry Department reports a relatively good harvest, while the Finance Department reports a poor one. Second, in terms of work style, they rely on hearsay and are careless. They are unwilling to be practical and realistic, do not investigate, do not research, do not analyze, and are perfunctory. In order to overcome this undesirable practice, first, future reports and summaries must be realistic and truthful, overcoming individualistic heroism and departmentalism, and reporting and summarizing work with an honest attitude, without any falsehoods, exaggerations, or concealment. The situation must be clearly explained in the report. Second, in the future, when writing anything, any numbers (of course, not limited to numbers) must be carefully reviewed and analyzed, and the true facts must be reflected responsibly. If there is any doubt, it can be investigated or people can be sent to conduct another investigation. Third, after writing reports in the future, all levels must have the responsible cadres carefully review them. If they are unrealistic or unreasonable, they must be clarified, and there must be no carelessness.

### 北岳五专通报各县　批判夸大事实的报告

　　北岳五专通报各县
  　批判夸大事实的报告
    【北岳电】五专署于九月二十八日发出通报，批判定兴县生产报告中夸大成绩数字的不良作风。如定兴县九月的生产工作总结报告中说：“四区南营邱村营玉凤父子二人，两早晨即刮草八车。”没有说明什么车，叫人难以置信。唐县统计，小麦去秋为八九三三九点八亩，而今夏调查征收前的报告，则为五四三二一亩，减少了三五零一八点八亩。完县的报告，十三辆水车能浇地八百多亩，平均一辆水车能浇六十多亩。究竟在什么情况下能浇这么多呢？也没交代清楚，后经询问，才知错了。徐水八月份打黏虫的报告上说：“八区东白楼、西白楼、常保、太保营、保营、蔡庄等村也被黏虫吃光。六个村统计共五六四九亩。”而八区的害虫调查表，十七个村统计，最重（指吃光的）却是二零二七亩。这样报告数字所起的恶果，小者是往返追问，耽误时间；大者则会错定政策方针。发生这些现象的原因，一、有些干部个人英雄主义与本位主义思想夸耀自己工作成绩，企图一鸣惊人，态度不老实。实业科报告种麦植棉亩数，常常比财政科报告征收的麦田棉田亩数较多。实业科报告年成较强，财政科报告即差。二、从工作作风上说是道听途说，粗枝大叶。不肯实事求是，不调查，不研究，不分析，马虎从事。为克服这种不良作风，第一，今后写报告写总结必须实事求是，克服个人英雄主义与本位主义思想，以老实态度报告与总结工作，不能有任何虚伪夸张，或隐瞒不报。报告时必须将情况交代清楚。第二，今后写东西，凡有数目字时（当然不只限于数目字），必须经过详细审查分析，必须负责的反映真实事实。如有怀疑，可以追查或派人去另行考查。第三，以后各级写好报告之后，一定要经过负责干部的精细审查，不合实际、不近情理的，一定要闹清楚，不能有丝毫马虎。
