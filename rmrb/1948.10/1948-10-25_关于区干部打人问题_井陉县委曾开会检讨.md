Regarding the Issue of District Cadres Beating People
  Jingxing County Party Committee Held a Meeting for Self-Criticism
    The People's Daily published a news item on August 21st about a district cadre in Jingxing beating someone to death. It also criticized the Jingxing County Party Committee for resisting instructions from higher authorities, repeatedly delaying the issue, and failing to resolve it promptly. The newspaper requested the County Party Committee to publish the handling result. However, nearly a month after the report was published, the Jingxing County Party Committee neither conducted a self-criticism nor replied with a letter. When reporters went to investigate the truth of the incident, the County Party Committee still expressed that "the criticism was somewhat excessive." It was not until the evening of September 19th, under the supervision of Comrade Hu Kaiming, the Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, that the County Party Committee convened a meeting to review its attitude and handling process regarding the issue of district cadres beating people.

    The Handling of Two Cases: Zhang Kaokao (mistakenly reported as Xu Kaokao in the paper), a security officer of the 9th district of Jingxing, caused dissatisfaction among the masses at a mass meeting in Shibanpian Village before the wheat harvest this year by announcing the issue of "whoever is allocated land, harvests the wheat." (There was also a marriage issue involved). More than a dozen middle-peasant households had a quarrel with Zhang Kaokao, which was later resolved through mediation. Unexpectedly, that night, Zhang Kaokao quietly slipped to Banqiao Village, led the militia to surround Shibanpian Village, and arrested nine people who had argued with him. He then tortured them to extract confessions, and they all confessed to being "Kuomintang secret agent riots." They were tied up and sent to the county. After interrogation by the Public Security Bureau, they were released.
    Afterward, Comrade Chu Hailin of the County Party Committee was responsible for handling the matter. At that time, Comrade Chu advocated that Zhang Kaokao should apologize to the people of Shibanpian Village, be criticized by the district cadres, and then be transferred to another district. However, because the district cadres did not agree, and Comrade Chu Hailin was also concerned that "the punishment would be too severe and the cadre would not be able to bear it," he decided not to transfer him. After Comrade Chu Hailin made the decision, he left the 9th district, and Zhang Kaokao only talked about it at the district cadre meeting, without apologizing to the people of Shibanpian Village. After Comrade Chu Hailin reported the handling process to the county, the County Committee decided to transfer Zhang Kaokao to the Prefectural Committee for training, and to write letters of sympathy to the beaten people in Shibanpian Village, and to provide material compensation if necessary. However, after the meeting, no letters were written, and no compensation was made. The district cadres only went to Shibanpian Village to say a few words, and then reported to the County Party Committee: "Everything is fine now."
    Another incident occurred in Nanxing Village, the 2nd district of Jingxing. On the night of May 18th, a cowherd named Shi Laishu lost five head of cattle due to carelessness. The next day, the district government summoned Shi Laishu to the district and detained him for trial. In the evening, the district head Liu Yonghua took the lead in hanging and beating Shi Laishu to extract a confession. Then Yang Fengming, the director of the district armed committee, Zhu Jingshan, the director of the district farmers' association, and Gao ××, the director of the district women's association, continued to torture him. As a result, Shi Laishu died of his injuries the next morning.
    After this incident, the County Party Committee summoned District Head Liu Yonghua to the county to await handling. Liu Yonghua initially refused to come, and although he came to the county once later, the matter was put on hold because County Party Secretary Zhang Wen (who has now been transferred but has not yet left the county) and County Magistrate Jia ×× went to the Prefectural Commissioner's Office for a meeting, and no one in the county was in charge. More than a month later, the County Magistrate returned from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office (the County Party Secretary had returned earlier) and brought back Commissioner Cui's urgent instruction to "remove Liu Yonghua from his post for investigation and sentence him to imprisonment." County Secretary Zhang Wen felt that "the punishment was too severe and might affect the morale of the cadres," and only advocated removing him from his post administratively. Therefore, a fierce debate broke out between the County Secretary and the County Magistrate at the County Party Committee meeting, resulting in a stalemate. Later, at several County Party Committee meetings, due to differing opinions, Commissioner Cui's instructions were not implemented, and it was only decided to "ask for instructions from higher authorities again." After the meeting, the decision to "ask for instructions from higher authorities again" was not implemented, and Zhang Wen went to the countryside, while Liu Yonghua still lived in the County Committee. Thus, the problem was delayed for more than twenty days and continued to be delayed. It was not until the family members of the deceased came to the county to file a complaint that County Magistrate Jia called the Prefectural Committee and asked for instructions on how to handle the matter. Comrade Hu Kaiming, the Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, immediately gave a clear instruction: "Remove him from his post both within the Party and administratively. And hand him over to the government for legal action." At that time, because Comrade Zhang Wen had not yet returned, the County Magistrate and the Director of Public Security Bureau did not dare to implement it, and time continued to be delayed. Later, when Comrade Zhang Wen returned from the countryside and learned of the instructions from the Prefectural Committee, although he still had some ideological disagreements, he had to comply and prepare for the handling. At this time, a dispute arose among the masses in Weizhou Town due to the canal issue, and Comrade Zhang Wen went to resolve it. After staying for more than half a month, he returned and handed Liu Yonghua over to the government for legal action. This incident took nearly two and a half months from occurrence to handling. Until Comrade He Jianping sent a manuscript to this newspaper, although the matter had been handled, the Prefectural Committee had never received a report from the Jingxing County Committee on the handling of this issue.

    Self-Criticism of the Issues: At this meeting, Comrade Zhang Wen and Comrade Chu Hailin first reported the truth of the incidents, and then everyone studied and reviewed the handling process in light of the August 21st newspaper.
    Everyone unanimously believed that the County Party Committee in the past did not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the district cadre beating incidents, and its attitude towards handling the issues was not serious enough. This was manifested in the fact that Comrade Chu Hailin abandoned his own opinion due to the opposition of the district cadres when handling the Zhang Kaokao issue; and that the County Party Committee had already decided to write letters of sympathy to the beaten people, but the result was that the district cadres only went and said a few words. In particular, the case of Liu Yonghua torturing and beating someone to death, a case involving human life, was delayed for a long time and could not be resolved quickly. At the same time, in handling these two issues, they all showed that they only considered the emotions of the cadres and ignored the interests of the masses. When everyone reviewed the process of handling Liu Yonghua, they did not ask for instructions when they had opinions, and did not report after handling the matter, which showed that they did not firmly implement Commissioner Cui's instructions.
    As the meeting continued to review, the Jingxing County Party Committee still had some different opinions regarding the criticisms in the August 21st newspaper about "the County Party Committee resisting orders and failing to handle the matter," "failing to prevent it beforehand and failing to handle it afterward," and "engaging in independence from the Party." Because since the beginning of spring, the government's policies and decrees on "protecting human rights and prohibiting beatings and killings" had been conveyed more than once at cadre meetings, it cannot be said that there was "no prevention beforehand." After the incident occurred, the County Party Committee handled it, but it was only a matter of the severity and timing of the handling, not "failure to handle it afterward," and of course, it cannot be said that the "County Party Committee resisted orders." Comrade Zhang Wen also believed that in the handling process, the failure to follow Commissioner Cui's instructions for prompt handling, the failure to ask for instructions beforehand, and the failure to report afterward could only be regarded as "unfirm implementation" of the instructions from higher authorities, not "engaging in independence from the Party." Comrade Hu Kaiming, the Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, pointed out sharply at the meeting: "Failure to ask for instructions when there are opinions, and failure to report after handling the matter. This is precisely a kind of anarchism and lack of discipline, an act of engaging in independence from the Party."
    When the final review came to the issue of the County Party Committee failing to send the handling results to the newspaper for publication, everyone felt: "Our past connections were too poor." And proposed: "In the future, both sides must strengthen connections and exchange information and opinions in a timely manner."
    Editor's note: The self-criticism of the Jingxing County Party Committee at the meeting was still not profound enough. For example, regarding the review of "failure to prevent beforehand and failure to handle afterward," since the government's decrees on protecting human rights had been conveyed "more than once" at cadre meetings long ago, why did the illegal incident of the main cadres of the district beating someone to death still occur? Where was the prior prevention? After the incident occurred, why did the County Party Committee fail to handle it seriously and in a timely manner, and even violated the instructions of higher authorities and repeatedly delayed the resolution? Where was the "handling afterward"? Therefore, this is by no means just a matter of "unfirm implementation" of the instructions from higher authorities and the "timing and severity" of handling the issue, but a lack of discipline and a lack of disciplinary thinking towards government decrees and the instructions of higher authorities, which is the fundamental problem. Until this newspaper revealed the truth of the incident and requested the County Party Committee to publish the handling results, the County Party Committee did not review and reply with a letter for nearly a month after the report was published. This was by no means a "poor connection" with the Party newspaper, but an intentional resistance to the criticism of the Party newspaper. In the process of handling the incident, the rapid resolution of the problem was hindered solely because the County Party Secretary did not agree, while other County Committee members failed to adhere to the instructions of higher authorities, failed to oppose incorrect opinions, and allowed the problem to be delayed, which was also wrong.

　　关于区干部打人问题
  　井陉县委曾开会检讨
    八月二十一日人民日报曾发表了井陉区干打死人的消息，同时对井陉县委抵抗上级指示，将问题一再拖延，不予迅速解决的态度，进行了批评；并请该县委将处理结果在报纸公布。然井陉县委见报后，将近一月，既未检讨，又未函复：及至记者前往调查事件真象时，该县县委尚表示“批评有些过重”；于九月十九日晚，始在地委书记胡开明同志督导下，召开了县委会议，对处理区干打人问题的态度与经过作了检讨。
    ★　　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　
　　★
    两件案件处理经过：井陉九区治安员张考考（报上误为许考考）于今年麦收前，在石板片村群众大会上，因宣布“谁分地谁割麦子”的问题，引起群众的不满（另外还有婚姻问题），当场有十余户中农与张考考发生了口角，后经调解也就解决了。不料当天夜里，张考考却悄悄溜到板桥村，带领民兵将石板片村包围，抓去与他吵架的九名群众；并进行拷打逼供，结果都承认为“国民党特务暴动”。便被捆绑送县，后经公安局审讯，即被释放。
    事后，县委褚海林同志，负责前往处理；当时褚同志主张除让张考考向石板片村群众道歉，并由区干对其进行批评外，再将张考考调往外区；后因区干不同意，同时褚海林同志也顾虑“处分过火，干部受不了”，又决定不予调动。褚海林同志做了决议，便离开了九区，而张考考却只在区干会上说了说就算完了，更没有到石板片村向群众道歉，褚海林同志向县报告处理经过后，县委会又决定将张考考调往地委会受训，同时给石板片村被打群众写信慰问，如必要时并进行物质赔偿。但会后既未写信，也未赔偿，只由区干前往石板片村说了说，便给县委报告：“没事了。”
    另一件事情，是发生在井陉二区南陉村，放牛工人石来书，因看守不慎，于五月十八日夜，失去耕牛五头，第二日区公所将石来书传区扣押候审，晚上区长刘永华便首先对石来书实行吊打逼供，接着区武委会主任杨凤鸣，与区农会主任朱景山、区妇会主任高××，连续进行拷打；结果石来书于天明后，终因伤势过重而死。
    此事发生后，县委即传区长刘永华来县听候处理，刘永华初则抗命不来，后来虽来县一次，又因县委书记张文同志（现已调动尚未离县）与县长贾××同志赴专署开会，县里无人负责，问题便搁下了。一个多月后，县长由专署回来（县委书记已早回），带来崔专员对刘永华“撤职查办，判处徒刑”的紧急指示。县书张文同志却感觉“处分过重，怕影响干部情绪”，只主张从行政上撤职。因此在县委会议上，县书与县长展开了激烈的争论，而形成了僵局；后来在数次县委会议，终因意见不统一，对崔专员的指示未予执行，只得决议“再请示上级”。会后对这“再请示上级”的决议也未执行，张文同志便下乡去了，而刘永华仍住在县委会，于是这个问题拖了二十多天之后，又继续拖下来。直到死者家属来县控告，贾县长才给地委打电话，请示处理办法；地委书记胡开明同志，当即肯定指示：“党内与行政上均予撤职处分。并送交政府依法处理。”当时因张文同志尚未回来，县长与公安局长未敢执行，时间就又继续拖延下来。后来张文同志下乡回来，知道地委来了指示，当时思想虽然还有些不通，也只得遵照执行，准备处理。此时适有威州镇群众因水渠问题发生纠纷，张文同志又前往解决，住了半个多月回来后，才将刘永华送交政府依法处理。这个事件从发生到处理，拖延了将近两个半月的时间。直到何建平同志给本报发稿时，此事虽已处理，但地委却始终未接到井陉县委会对处理这一问题的报告。
    ★　　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　　★

    对问题的检讨：在这个会议上，首先由张文同志与褚海林同志报告了事件的真象，接着大家便将处理经过对照着八月二十一日的报纸，做了研究与检讨。
    大家一致认为县委过去对区干打人事件的严重性，认识不足，处理问题的态度，不够严肃；这表现在处理张考考问题时，褚海林同志因区干的反对，而放弃了自己的意见；与县委已经决议写信慰问被打群众，而结果只让区干前往一说了之。尤其对刘永华拷打逼供打死人的这种人命案件，拖了很长时间，未能迅速解决。同时在处理这两个问题上，都表现出只顾虑了干部情绪，而忽视了群众利益。当大家检讨到在处理刘永华的过程中，有意见不请示，处理后不报告，表现了对崔专员的指示，执行的不坚决。
    会议继续检讨下去，井陉县委对八月二十一日报上，关于“县委抗命不加处理”，“事先没防止，事后不处理”，“向党闹独立性”这些批评，还有些不同的意见。因为入春以来，在干部会上不止一次的传达了政府关于“保障人权，不准打杀人”的政策法令，不能说是“事先没防止”，事件发生后，县委便进行处理，只是处理的轻重与迟早问题，而不是“事后不处理”，当然更不能说是“县委抗命”了。张文同志也认为在处理过程中，未能遵照崔专员的指示迅速处理，事前未请示，事后未报告，这只能算是对上级指示“执行不坚决”，不能算是“向党闹独立性”。地委书记胡开明同志在会议上曾尖锐指出：“有意见不请示，处理后不报告。这正是一种无政府无纪律，向党闹独立性的行为”。
    当最后检讨到县委未将处理结果寄交报社发表这一问题时，大家均感到：“过去咱们连系太差了。”并提出：“今后双方一定加强联系，并及时交换情况与意见。”
    编者认为：井陉县委在会议上的检讨，还是不深刻的。如对“事前不防止，事后不处理”的检讨，既然很早就在干部会上“不止一次”地传达了政府保障人权的法令，为什么还会发生区的主要干部打死人的犯法事件？事前防止何在？事件既经发生之后，为什么县委又未认真地及时地处理，甚至违反上级指示，一再拖延解决？“事后处理”何在？所以这决不只是对上级指示“执行不坚决”处理问题的“迟早与轻重”问题，而是对于政府法令与上级指示的一种无纪律态度、无纪律思想，这就是根本问题所在。迄本报将事件真象揭露，并请该县委公布处理结果，而该县委见报将近一月，并未检讨函复，这也决不是什么与党报“联系太差”，而是有意的抵抗党报批评。在事件处理过程中，只因县委书记不同意，阻碍了问题的迅速解决，而其他县委对上级指示未予坚持，对不正确意见未予反对，听任问题拖延下去，这也是错误的。
