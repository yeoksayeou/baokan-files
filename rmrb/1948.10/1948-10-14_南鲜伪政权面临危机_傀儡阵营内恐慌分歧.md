Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. TASS reports: A New York Times reporter in a dispatch from Seoul admits that the South Korean puppet government is facing a crisis. Seoul Radio also revealed the panic and division within the puppet faction. Following the inconclusive discussions in September regarding the so-called agreement on the transfer of administrative functions between the U.S. military government and the Lee Seung-man puppet regime, the disputes during the debate in the puppet National Assembly over the puppet government's bill to requisition grain at low prices have intensified. As farmers resolutely oppose this measure to plunder their grain harvest, the situation in many areas of South Korea is very tense, therefore, some puppet assemblymen have demanded amendments to the bill. Puppet assemblyman Kim Jung-rong (transliteration) said: "If this bill is approved and implemented, a riot will break out that the government will not be able to suppress." Kim's statement shows that the puppets feel as if they are sitting on a volcano. In the face of this situation, the Lee Seung-man "government" felt very timid, and hurriedly began to suppress, closing three left-wing newspapers and news agencies on the 4th and 5th, and arresting twenty editors. The people's dissatisfaction has also deepened the infighting and division within the puppet government. The puppet Minister of Interior recently accused Lee Seung-man's special envoy to the United States, Zhao Bingyu, of treason. The puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs and the puppet Minister without Portfolio, apparently fearing subsequent accusations, have submitted their resignations. In view of the chaos in railway transportation and the increasing frequency of U.S. military train derailments, Lee Seung-man intends to dismiss the puppet Minister of Railways. The puppet Vice President, Lee Si-young, is not attending the work of the puppet State Council due to discord with Lee Seung-man, claiming illness. Supporters of Lee Seung-man, fearing that the discord within the puppet government and the puppet National Assembly will expose the full corruption of this anti-people regime, are trying to "consolidate" its internal structure by reorganizing the government and suppressing the opposition.

　　南鲜伪政权面临危机
    傀儡阵营内恐慌分歧
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社报导：纽约时报记者在其汉城发出的消息中承认南朝鲜傀儡政府正面临着危机。汉城广播也透露出傀儡阵营内部恐慌和分歧的情形。继九月间讨论美军政府与李承晚伪政权间所谓移交行政职务协定无结果之后，伪国会在讨论伪政府所提以低价征购谷物的法案时，争吵更加剧烈了。由于农民坚决反对这一掠夺他们粮食收获的措施，南朝鲜许多地区情势很是紧张，因此，若干伪议员就提出修改法案的要求。伪议员金鼎荣（译音）说：“倘使批准这一法案并且执行它，暴动便会爆发，那是政府无法镇压的。”金氏的发言，显示着傀儡们感觉他们仿佛坐在火山上。李承晚“政府”在这种情势面前感到很为胆怯，就慌忙开始镇压，四五两日封了三家左派报纸和通讯社，逮捕了二十名编辑人员。人民的不满也使伪政府内部的倾轧和分裂加深起来。伪内政部长最近曾控诉李承晚驻美特使赵炳玉犯叛国罪。伪外交部长与伪不管部长显然害怕接踵而来的责难，已提出辞呈。李承晚鉴于铁道运输的混乱和美军火车出轨事件的日益频繁，打算将伪铁道部长撤职。伪副总统李始荣因和李承晚不和，称病不参加伪国务会议的工作。李承晚的支持者害怕伪政府与伪国会内部的不睦，将会暴露这一反人民的政权的充分的腐化，正想以改组政府和镇压反对派来“巩固”其内部。
