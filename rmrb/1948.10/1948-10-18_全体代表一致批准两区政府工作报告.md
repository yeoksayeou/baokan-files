　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After the North China Provisional People's Congress listened to the work reports of the original Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region governments, and based on the review report of the review committee, it made the following resolution: "The Congress, after listening to the work reports of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei District governments, and the review report of the review committee, unanimously approved the work reports of the two district governments. The Congress believes that from the War of Resistance Against Japan to the People's Liberation War, the needs of the people have changed with the development of the situation, and the governments have been able to adapt to the war situation, meet the requirements of the people, grasp policies at any time, overcome all difficulties, and loyally and bravely carry out their tasks. In particular, after more than eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they immediately mobilized all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to resolutely oppose the traitorous civil war of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by American imperialism, and to thoroughly eliminate the two major tasks of the feudal system's land reform, which achieved great results. Other aspects, such as production and thrift, disaster relief, developing culture and education, establishing a new democratic politics, implementing economic policies of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, have also achieved considerable success. The government has made reports, and the Congress believes that the two governments have basically completed the tasks entrusted by the people of North China.

　　At the same time, the two governments still have some shortcomings in their work, manifested in the lack of precise calculation in mobilizing civilian labor to support the war, the occurrence of lax discipline in certain work links, and the existence of a certain degree of bureaucratic work style in leadership. The Congress believes that some shortcomings that occurred in the two governments under the circumstances of tense war and heavy tasks are unavoidable or excusable in the revolutionary process, and therefore fully agrees with the self-criticism and timely correction methods in the work reports of the two governments."

　　全体代表一致批准两区政府工作报告
    【本报特讯】华北临时人民代表大会听取了原晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两边区政府的工作报告后，根据审查委员会的审查报告，特作出如下决议：“大会听取了晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两区政府的工作报告，及审查委员会的审查报告之后，全体代表一致批准两区政府的工作报告。大会认为从抗日战争到人民解放战争，人民的需要随着时局的发展有所不同，而且政府都能适应战争形势，符合人民要求，随时掌握政策，克服一切困难，忠诚勇敢地执行自己任务，特别是在八年多的抗日战争之后，紧接着动员一切人力、物力、财力坚决反对美帝国主义所支持的蒋介石匪帮的卖国内战，与彻底消灭封建制度的土地改革的两大任务上是有很大成绩的。其他如生产节约，救灾救荒，开展文化教育，建立新民主主义的政治，执行发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利经济政策等等，都有相当成绩。政府已作报告，大会认为两政府基本上完成了华北人民所付托的任务。
    同时两政府在工作中还存在着某些缺点，表现在动员民力支援战争上尚缺乏精确计算，在某些工作环节上尚发生过纪律松弛状态，以及在领导上还存在某种程度的官僚主义作风。大会认为两政府在战争紧张，任务繁重的情况下所发生的某些缺点，是在革命过程中所难于避免的，或可以原谅的，因此完全同意两政府在工作报告中的自我检讨与及时纠正的办法。”
