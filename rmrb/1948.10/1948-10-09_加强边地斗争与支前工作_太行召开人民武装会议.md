　　Strengthening Border Area Struggle and Supporting the Front

    Taihang Holds People's Armed Forces Conference

    [Taihang Telegram] The People's Armed Forces Department of the Taihang Military Region held a joint conference of armed forces departments from various districts in the first half of September to discuss the future direction and tasks of the People's Armed Forces work, arrangements for work in the coming winter and spring, preparations for supporting the front and participating in the war, and struggles in the border areas. The conference summary pointed out: At present, some people are satisfied with the current land reform and the victory of military struggle. In the People's Armed Forces, there is only a view of border operations and supporting the front. They lack the idea of safeguarding the fruits of victory and the long-term interests of the people, ignore the enemy's organization of sabotage activities in our hinterland by using the masses' superstitious and backward thinking, and neglect anti-espionage and security work. This complacency and paralysis must be overcome quickly. It also pointed out that the road of correct development of the Taihang People's Armed Forces through mobilizing, organizing, and arming the masses is not impure in composition, only individual. The problem of work style in the old areas and some semi-old areas is also not a widespread and serious phenomenon. The general direction and general task of the People's Armed Forces in the future should be to strengthen and support the struggle against the enemy in the border areas, and to support the front and anti-espionage and security work in the hinterland. On the basis of ending land reform, democratic party consolidation, and production movement in the border area guerrilla warfare and the hinterland, we must continue to improve ideological awareness, improve the organization, strengthen policy education and rectification work, so that the People's Armed Forces become a strong defender of the democratic production construction order. In order to realize the above general direction and general task, the following specific tasks must be completed: (1) Before the big battle arrives in the border areas, we must overcome the idea of relying on foreign aid and waiting for the main force, clarify that the border areas must rely on the masses, armed and persevere in the struggle, establish the idea of a broad mass guerrilla war, unite all possible people, form a united front against Chiang, and integrate labor and military affairs, and implement the border area struggle from the perspective of serving the long-term interests of the masses. The construction of the People's Armed Forces in the border areas must pay attention to education, review, and transformation, focusing on exposing various rumors, resolving confused ideas, conducting current affairs and policy discipline education, and transforming work style. In the process, we should pay more attention to cadre education, using rotation education methods to improve cadres' ability to effectively carry out border area struggles. (2) The People's Armed Forces in the hinterland are mainly responsible for maintaining social order and protecting the democratic production order in the liberated areas. Therefore, it is necessary to expose and crack down on espionage rumors and sabotage activities, suppress reactionary armed rebellions, protect transportation and power lines, strictly prevent theft, regularly check household registrations and hotels, and patrol and interrogate suspicious pedestrians. (3) At any time, summarize new experiences in participating in the war and supporting the front, implement supporting the front education at any time and any place, and be prepared for large-scale war participation tasks at any time, and establish a long-term view of supporting the front. (4) The education and rectification work of cadres and militiamen, especially the universal training of self-defense forces, should become one of the important tasks of the leaders of the People's Armed Forces at all levels. And we must pay attention to cultivating young reserve forces. (5) Rectify the People's Armed Forces, strengthen ideological education, transform work style, and carry out criticism and self-criticism.
