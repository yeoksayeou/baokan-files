　　Plumping Up Their Faces to Look Swollen to Cover Up a Miserable Defeat
  　Enemy Troops on the Southern Front Revert from Integrated Divisions and Brigades Back to Army and Division Designations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd] According to captured Kuomintang military documents and prisoner confessions from various battlefields recently, the enemy's integrated divisions on the southern front have successively reverted to their original army designations, and brigades have reverted to division designations. Furthermore, newly organized and provisional armies and divisions on various battlefields have also been changed to formal designations. It is reported that the Kuomintang army changed the armies on the southern front to integrated divisions and divisions to brigades in 1946. Now, due to suffering heavy losses in the anti-people's war, they have changed the integrated divisions and brigades back to armies and divisions, and have changed the newly organized and provisional designations to formal designations, creating the false impression that their "army continues to expand" in order to deceive people who are unaware of the truth.

　　打肿脸充胖子掩饰惨败
  　南线敌军整编师旅又恢复为军师番号
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据近来各战场缴获国民党军文件及俘虏口供证实：南线敌军各整编师已陆续按原番号恢复为军，旅恢复为师。又各战场之新编暂编军师等，亦改为正式番号。按国民党军曾于一九四六年将南线各军改为整编师，师改为旅。现因在反人民战争中损失惨重，又将整编师与旅改称为军与师，并将新编、暂编的番号改为正式番号，达成其“军队继续扩大”的假象，以其迷惑不明真相的人们。
