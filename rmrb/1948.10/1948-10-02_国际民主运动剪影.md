Glimpses of the International Democratic Movement

    ▲ The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council's conference in Warsaw in late August resolved: 1. To convene the Second World Youth Congress at the end of 1949. 2. To designate February 21st each year as "International Youth Day" to "support youth struggling against the colonial system." 3. To launch a protest movement in September and October this year against U.S. and British interference in Greece, against the Kuomintang-ruled areas of China, and against the fascist terror of Franco.
    ▲ The International Cooperative Women's Guild recently held a meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and decided to cooperate more closely with the Women's International Democratic Federation in the future, and called on women around the world to unite in the struggle against warmongers.
    ▲ Left-wing political parties and groups on the island of Cyprus at the eastern end of the Mediterranean recently issued a declaration demanding autonomy. The island's labor unions organized protest rallies in various cities in mid-August against the British governor's dissolution of the island's advisory council. On September 16th, mass rallies were held in major cities to protest the fascist dictatorship of the British colonial government. According to the Soviet Red Fleet newspaper, U.S. imperialism is attempting to exploit this situation to "persuade Britain to return Cyprus to Greece" in order for the United States to control the island.
    ▲ In Cape Town, the southernmost part of Africa, 10,000 people recently held a large demonstration against the reactionary "racial segregation" policy of the new fascist government of Malan in the Union of South Africa. After the meeting, hundreds of non-Europeans occupied railway cars "reserved for Europeans only."
    ▲ The Netherlands recently experienced mass demonstrations protesting high living costs and food panic, opposing the government's policy of increasing military spending and canceling food subsidies, which threatened people's livelihoods, due to the tasks given by the Marshall Plan. The Dutch Communist Party in parliament also demanded that the government take necessary measures.

　　国际民主运动剪影
    ▲世界民主青年联盟理事会八月下旬华沙会议曾决议：一、在一九四九年年底召开第二次世界青年代表大会。二、把每年二月二十一日订为“声援为反对殖民地制度而斗争的青年”的“国际青年节”。三、在今年九、十月间发动一个反对美英干涉希腊、反对中国国民党统治区和佛朗哥法西斯恐怖的抗议运动。
    ▲国际妇女合作社运动协会最近在捷京布拉格开会，决定今后和世界民主妇联更密切的合作，并且号召全世界妇女在反对战争贩子的斗争中团结起来。
    ▲地中海东端塞浦鲁斯岛左翼政党和团体不久以前曾发表宣言，要求自治。该岛的劳工联盟八月中旬在各城市组织了抗议大会，反对英国总督解散该岛的咨议会，九月十六日，各主要城市又举行群众大会，抗议英国殖民政府的法西斯独裁。据苏红舰队报称，美帝国主义企图利用这个形势，“劝告英国把塞浦鲁斯归回希腊”，以便美国统治该岛。
    ▲非洲最南端的开普敦最近有一万群众举行大示威，反对南非联邦马兰新法西斯政府“种族隔离”的反动政策。会后几百非欧洲人占据了“只让欧洲人坐的”铁路客车。
    ▲荷兰最近爆发了抗议生活费太贵和粮食恐慌的群众示威，反对政府由于负担马歇尔计划所给予的任务，增加军费，取消粮食津贴威胁民食的政策。荷兰共产党在议会中也要求政府采取必要措施。
