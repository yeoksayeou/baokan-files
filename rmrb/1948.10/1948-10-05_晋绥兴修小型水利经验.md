　　Experiences in Building Small-Scale Water Conservancy Projects in Jin Sui
This year, emancipated peasants in various parts of Jin Sui have actively engaged in building small-scale water conservancy projects such as canals, dams, wells, gallows, and spring tapping. According to incomplete statistics, at least 360,000 mu of dry land have been converted into irrigated land. The experiences in mobilization and organization in various regions are as follows:
    (1) How to mobilize? Due to the high level of peasant enthusiasm for production after land reform, the construction of water conservancy projects is mostly initiated by the peasants themselves. For example, the water conservancy projects in Shuo County, which increased irrigated land by 80,000 mu this year, were proposed by representatives of districts and villages, then discussed and decided upon at the county's water conservancy representatives' meeting. The representatives then returned to their villages to further organize the masses to carry them out. However, in some places, peasants were reluctant to build due to fear of labor costs, etc., and needed persuasion through publicity to be mobilized. For example, the village head of Guo Jiata and other villages in Xiangning County personally measured and found that 280 mu of dry land could be converted into paddy fields, but the masses were reluctant to repair them because they disliked labor. The village head then led the masses to re-survey, proving that the labor was not much, but the grain output could be increased by 60 shi, which persuaded the masses. As a result, everyone worked hard and completed the project in three days. Some people in Shuo County wanted to rely on the government to loan tens of thousands of shi of grain to complete all water conservancy projects within one year. After cadres led the masses in a realistic discussion, they decided to first repair the canals that were highly profitable and required less labor, and then develop them gradually year by year. Some cadres also have the idea of relying on loans from higher authorities and do not dare to boldly use experienced people in the countryside for water conservancy. They must be educated and persuaded in advance.
    (2) How to organize? The water conservancy project in Dawu Town, Lishi County, is under the overall responsibility of the Farmers' Association Committee. A canal opening committee is set up under it, composed of newly elected water conservancy committee members and experienced old water conservancy experts, who are responsible for leading various canal opening affairs. After work every day, the canal opening committee holds meetings to review, promote democracy, absorb experience, and establish reward and punishment systems to carry out commendation and criticism. Government inspection and supervision are very important. The heads of Shuo County's districts are all responsible for promoting and guiding the work. In addition to sending special personnel for guidance, the main responsible persons in the county also personally inspect, supervise, check, and solve problems in a timely manner.
    (3) How to solve the problem of manpower and financial resources? Land benefiting from water conservancy projects will provide labor according to the number of mu, and if it is insufficient, the government will loan grain to hire labor or provide assistance. Disaster-stricken areas use work as relief. Labor exchange between people and livestock: those with livestock will cultivate the land, and those without livestock will repair the canals. They are combined voluntarily so that neither is delayed. This method is used in the Datou Village area of Shuo County, and water conservancy is greatly developed; and it has also promoted many idlers to participate in production.

### 晋绥兴修小型水利经验

　　晋绥兴修小型水利经验
    今年晋绥各地翻身农民积极兴办修渠，筑坝，打井，修吊杆，掏水泉等小型水利，据不完全统计，至少已使三十六万亩以上旱地变为水地。各地发动与组织的点滴经验如下：
    （一）怎样发动？由于土地改革后，农民生产情绪高涨，因此兴办水利，大多是农民自动提出要求。如朔县今年增加了八万亩水地的水利工程，就是由各区村代表会提出要求，然后在全县水利代表会议上讨论决定方案，代表回村再进一步组织群众进行的。但也有些地方农民因怕费工等，不愿兴办，需要宣传说服才能发动起来的。如乡宁郭家塔等村经村长亲自测量，认为可变二百八十亩旱地为水田，但群众嫌费工不愿修，村长又领着群众再次勘查，证明费工不多，却可增产六十大石粮食，才说服了群众。结果大家努力，三天即告完成。朔县部分群众想依赖政府贷粮几万石，一年之内修好全部水利，经过干部领导群众进行实事求是的讨论后，才决定首先修好利大而费工少的水渠，然后再逐年发展。有的干部也有依赖上级贷粮的思想和不敢大胆使用农村中旧有对水利有经验的人，对他们均须事先进行教育说服。
    （二）怎样组织？离石县大武镇水利工程由农会委员会负总责，下设开渠委员会，由新选的水利委员和有经验的老水头组成，分工领导各项修渠事务。每日收工后，由开渠委员会开会检讨，发扬民主，吸收经验，且订立奖惩制度，进行表扬和批评。政府检查督促，非常重要。朔县各区区长等都负责推动指导，县里除派专人指导外，主要负责人也都亲自巡视、督促、检查与及时解决问题。
    （三）人工和财力如何解决？得到水利土地按亩出工，不足时，由政府贷粮雇工或助工。灾荒地区以工代赈。人畜变工，有牲口的耕地，无牲口的修渠，自愿结合，两不耽误。朔县大涂村一带运用此法，水利大兴；且促使许多二流子也参加了生产。
