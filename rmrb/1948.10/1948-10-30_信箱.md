　　Mailbox to Heng Yongtian Gen Wangjun:
    You asked why the postal rates in various districts of North China are not unified. Now the postal bureaus of the two districts have merged, and unified regulations will be established soon. To Wang Zizhong from Pingding:
    The new marriage regulations will be announced by the North China People's Government soon. To Zhang Zifu from × district of Anping County:
    It is inappropriate for the village cadre of Zhang Dong Village in the Fourth District of Xingtai to force your wife to be matched with Zhang Erqiuzi. The county and district governments should resolve this. We have forwarded your opinion to the Xingtai County Committee, asking them to handle it. To Huang Zhaokun from Xingtai City:
    Regarding the wrongly criticized industrialists and businessmen in the Fourth District of Xingtai City who are now in financial difficulties and have not yet been corrected and compensated, we have informed the Xingtai City Committee and asked them to resolve it. To Zhang Sanmin from the Sixth District of Wutai:
    Oil mills and pharmacies are both industrial and commercial enterprises. Now that they have been sealed and kept in the farmers' association, they should be returned to their original owners.
