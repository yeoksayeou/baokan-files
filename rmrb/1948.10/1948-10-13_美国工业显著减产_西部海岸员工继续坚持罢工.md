Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 10th: According to an Associated Press report from New York on the 1st, production cuts in American factories have become evident recently. The reduction first occurred in all textile industries in the New England states, the center of the textile industry, and is now spreading to other industries. The retail market has shrunk, and inventories have increased. Factory owners find it difficult to sell all their products if they maximize their factory's productivity. This situation is due to retail buyers being unable to afford high prices and the wartime accumulation of demand finally being met. In this period's business news reports, there are records of certain shoe industries cutting production, with the International Shoe Company reducing its ten shoe factories to four days a week. As the tire market shrinks, the Rubber Manufacturers Association confirms that synthetic rubber production has been reduced first. Goodyear manager Collier said he estimates this year's rubber consumption at 1.05 million tons, and next year it will be only 950,000 tons. Rayon and wool mills are expected to join cotton weaving in becoming saturated. Even the busy steel industry admits that steel production is catching up with demand, and in some cases, exceeding it. According to figures from the National Credit Bureau's Market Planning Department, retailers' inventories reached a post-war high on May 1st. Although it has slightly decreased since then, a large number of autumn goods have poured in from manufacturers.

Simultaneous to the emerging overproduction in the United States, the "Consumer Reports" magazine pointed out, according to a report by the Telegraph Agency, that more than half of American families' income cannot keep up with rising prices. Today, a dollar's purchasing power is only 55 cents compared to before the war. Official consumer income and expenditure statistics show that the low-wage earners, accounting for more than a quarter of the country's population, have no savings left.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 11th: Reports from various sources: The strike of dockworkers and sailors on the US West Coast, which began on September 2nd, is still ongoing. The strike has paralyzed commercial shipping between the US West Coast and the Far East. Supported by the government, shipping companies are adopting delaying tactics, conspiring to weaken the union, refusing to negotiate with the dockworkers' union, and demanding the replacement of the union's current leadership, which refuses to sign non-communist pledges. The vast majority of union members oppose such pledges that violate workers' interests.

In addition, the strike of 16,000 oil workers affiliated with the CIO in California, which began in early September, is also ongoing. Gasoline shortages have occurred in the market, and the Pacific Sea, Land, and Air Forces have been ordered to save gasoline as much as possible. In addition, railway unions representing 1.5 million railway workers are negotiating with railway companies, demanding a 25% increase in wages per hour and an eight-hour reduction in the work week.

### 美国工业显著减产  西部海岸员工继续坚持罢工

　　美国工业显著减产
    西部海岸员工继续坚持罢工
    【新华社陕北十日电】据美联社纽约一日讯：美国工厂的减产近来已显明起来。减产首先发生在纺织业中心新英格兰各州的全部纺织业中，现正蔓延到其他工业。零售市场已经缩小，存货已经增多。厂主们发现如果他们尽量发挥他们工厂的生产力，就很难卖出全部产品。这种情形是由于零买主付不起高昂的价格，也由于战时所积累起来的需求已最后得到了满足。在本期商业新闻报导中，有某些制鞋业减产的记载，国际制鞋公司已将它十个制鞋厂减为每周四日。随着车胎市场的缩小，橡皮制造商协会证实人造橡皮已首先减产。固特异公司经理柯利尔说：他估计今年的橡皮消费为一百零五万吨，明年将只有九十五万吨。预料人造丝与羊毛厂也会与棉织业一样归于销路饱和之列。甚至生产忙碌的制钢业也承认钢产量正赶上需求，在某些情形下，且超过需求。根据全国信贷局市场计划科的数字，零售商存货在五月一日达到战后最高峰，以后虽稍见减低，但秋季的货物又已自制造商处大批涌到了。
    与美国渐现生产过剩同时，据电通社引“消费者报导”杂志指出：美国一半以上家庭的收入都赶不上物价的高涨。今天一块美元的购买力只及战前五角五分。官方消费者收支统计数字表明：占全国人口四分之一以上的低薪阶层，已一点积蓄都没有了。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】各方报导：九月二日开始的美国西海岸码头工人与海员的罢工，仍在坚持中。罢工已使美国西岸与远东的商轮交通陷于麻痹。航业公司在政府支持下采取拖延诡计，阴谋削弱工会，拒绝和码头工会谈判，并要求更换该工会现在拒绝签署非共具结的领导机构。工会绝大多数会员反对这种违背工人利益的具结。
    又九月初开始的加利福尼亚州产联所属一万六千石油工人的罢工迄今亦在坚持中。市上已发生汽油缺货现象，太平洋海陆空军奉命尽量节省汽油。此外代表一百五十万铁路工人的铁路工会正与铁路公司谈判中，要求每小时增资百分之二十五，每周少工作八小时。
