　　Please, Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee, Investigate and Reply:
　　What Problems Really Exist in the Villages Around Handan?
　　The former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Daily published a report on June 12th regarding the failure to rectify deviations in villages such as Sucaozhuang in Handan, and the continued infringement on the interests of middle peasants. An accompanying short commentary criticized the Handan leadership. Subsequently, the Handan County Committee sent a letter of defense, the attitude of which was not sufficiently proper, claiming that the news report did not conform to the actual situation.

　　On September 1st, this newspaper received a long letter signed by several readers from Handan, including Dabo, stating that the mood of the masses in the villages around Handan was chaotic, and that deviations had not been rectified. At that time, this newspaper believed that it was the busy farming season, and the area may not have had time to rectify deviations, and the above situation might exist temporarily. By September 10th, two more letters were received from readers in Handan, Ruiting and Li Shixiu, also stating that not only were deviations not being rectified in the villages around the city of Handan, but some cadres continued to threaten the masses, saying: not only would there be no compensation, but there would be major struggles after the autumn harvest, and so on. After receiving these letters, this newspaper felt that the problem had become serious, but was still concerned that it might be a one-sided account. At the same time, we did not know whether the villages around the city were under the leadership of the city or the county (later letters from readers indicated that some were under the city's leadership and some under the county's). For the sake of prudence, the readers' letters were sent by registered mail to the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee, requesting the Third Prefectural Committee to promptly supervise the Handan leadership, or to personally conduct an investigation. If the situation was confirmed, it was hoped that it would be handled correctly based on the specific circumstances, and that detailed information and the results of the handling would be communicated to this newspaper.

　　No results were received after the letter was sent. In early October, we received three more letters from more than ten readers in Handan, including Guo Shiyu, Li Jiasheng, and Yutang, reflecting that the middle peasants who were wrongly struggled in the villages around Handan had still not been compensated, that confiscated property was not being distributed, that cadres continued to threaten the masses, and that the mood of the masses was extremely chaotic. The letters also urged this newspaper to help deal with the situation quickly. Because no reply had been received from the Third Prefectural Committee, this newspaper still did not dare to make a final judgment on the situation, so it sent another letter to the Third Prefectural Committee urging action, and at the same time published a mailbox notice asking readers to wait.

　　After the second letter was sent, it was as if it had sunk into the sea, with not a single word of reply. However, this newspaper continued to receive six letters signed by nearly twenty readers from Handan, including Du Chongxiao, Li Shangqing, Ma Mingtai, and Chen Yuzhang. In addition to continuing to reflect the above situation, they also said: "It's getting cold, things are not being distributed, and the wrongly struggled households have no clothes or food and can't hold on!" Finally, they anxiously urged: "Please, higher authorities, come quickly to rectify the deviations!" Obviously, the situation there cannot be ignored. It has been four months since the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Daily criticized Handan in early June, and the situation in the villages around Handan continues to be chaotic. Can't the Handan leadership hear or see this serious situation and the voices of the masses? Have they not inspected the work in four months? The Third Prefectural Committee should urge the Handan leadership to conduct a profound self-criticism, resolutely and effectively correct this state of disorganization and anarchy, and this bureaucratic attitude of indifference to the masses, and must strictly criticize them.

　　At the same time, this newspaper also believes that Handan is directly under the jurisdiction of the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee, and the Prefectural Committee is also responsible for allowing this serious situation to develop. Before the editorial department sent the letter, it repeatedly disclosed the opinions of the masses, but the Third Prefectural Committee did not inspect and correct this situation. After the letter was sent, a month passed without any inspection or reply. At the same time, the New Masses Daily also published the situation in Handan on September 28th and put forward specific opinions on Handan. Can they still say they didn't know? We believe that this attitude of not inspecting the work of lower levels, turning a deaf ear to the voices of the masses, and ignoring the opinions of the Party newspaper should also be examined. After seeing today's newspaper, the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee is requested to promptly personally supervise the Handan leadership to conduct an inspection, to see what problems exist in the villages around Handan City, how they should be corrected, and how they are being corrected. Please publish the true picture of the inspection and the results of the correction in this newspaper.

### 请冀南三地委检查答复　邯郸周围村庄到底存在些什么问题？

专栏：

　　请冀南三地委检查答复
  　邯郸周围村庄到底存在些什么问题？
    原晋冀鲁豫人民日报于六月十二日发表了邯郸苏曹庄等村不进行纠偏，相反仍继续侵犯中农利益的消息，并发表短评，对邯郸领导方面进行了批评，随后邯郸县委曾来信申辩，态度不够端正，说该消息报导不合乎实际情况。
    九月一日，本报接到邯郸读者大保等数人签名的一封长信，说邯郸周围村庄群众情绪混乱，并未进行纠偏等情况。当时本报认为正值农忙时节，该地一时未来得及进行纠偏，上述情况暂时存在是可能的。及至九月十日，又连接邯郸读者瑞亭、李士秀等来信两封，也是说邯市周围村庄，不但不进行纠偏，并且仍有干部继续吓唬群众说：不但不补偿，秋后还要大斗等等。本报接到此信后，感觉问题已经严重，但还怕是片面情况，同时也不了解市周围村庄是归市还是县领导（以后读者来信中，有说是归市领导，也有说是县领导的）。为慎重起见，即将读者来信，用双挂号给冀南三地委一并寄去，同时请三地委迅速督促邯郸领导方面或是亲自前往进行调查，如情况属实，希根据具体情况予以正确处理，并望将详细情况与处理结果告诉本报。
    去信后未获结果。至十月初，我们又连续接到邯郸郭士玉、李家生、玉堂等十余位读者的三封来信，反映邯市周围村庄对错斗中农仍未补偿，浮财封存不分，干部继续吓唬群众，群众情绪极为混乱。信中并督促本报迅速帮助处理，因未接三地委复信，本报对此情况仍未敢作最后的判断，故又一面给三地委去信催促，一面刊登信箱请读者等待。
    第二封信发出后，直到现在，有如石沉大海，未见只字片纸之答复，但本报却又陆续接到邯郸杜冲霄，李上青、马明太、陈玉章等将近二十位读者签名的六封来信，除继续反映上述情况外，并说：“天冷了，东西不分，错斗户无衣无食，真吃不住劲！”最后很焦急的督促说：“请上级快来纠偏吧！”显然该地情况不容漠视。自六月上旬原晋冀鲁豫人民日报对邯郸进行批评后，到现在已经四个月，邯市周围村庄情况仍继续混乱，邯郸领导方面对此严重情况，及群众的这些呼声，难道竟听不到也看不见吗？四个月来对工作也不检查吗？这种无组织无政府状态，这种对群众漠不关心的官僚主义态度，三地委应督促邯郸领导方面深刻检讨，坚决切实纠正，并必须对其进行严格批评。
    同时，本报也认为：邯郸是冀南三地委直辖地区，地委对此种严重情况任其发展，也不无责任。本报编辑部去信之前，虽曾一再披露群众意见，三地委对此情况，未见有检查纠正；既去信之后，时过一月，也不见检查答复。同时，新大众报亦于九月二十八日发表了邯郸情况，并对邯郸提出了具体意见，难道还能说不知道么？我们认为象这种对下级工作不检查、对群众的呼声充耳不闻，对党报的意见不理睬的态度，也是应该检讨的。请冀南三地委看到今天的报纸后，迅速亲自督导邯郸领导方面进行检查，看到底邯郸市周围各村庄里存在些什么问题？应该如何纠正？是怎样纠正的？并请将检查的真象及纠正结果公开在本报答复。
