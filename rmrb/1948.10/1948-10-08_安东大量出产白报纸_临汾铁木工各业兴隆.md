* The Jilin City Publicly Operated Dongjian Cement Factory resumed production on August 1st. The highest daily output reached 134 tons, nearly the same as during the puppet Manchukuo period. Furthermore, the Jilin City Cement Factory resumed manufacturing cement tiles and cement shortly after Jilin City was recovered. The output of cement tiles has now increased from the initial daily output of 420 to 1,050.

* The 100-inch paper machine at the Northeast Andong Paper Mill, which had been out of operation for four years, has been repaired and began producing large quantities of white newsprint, banknote paper, and cigarette paper on August 15th. The Liaobei Paper Mill, after several months of research, has been producing glossy white paper in large quantities.

* Due to sufficient power supply, industries in various parts of Northeast China have been increasing their power equipment. For example, compared with the end of 1946, the number of machines in the Mudanjiang iron industry has increased threefold, and the use of electricity has increased tenfold. The textile industry has increased its power by more than twenty-two times in the past year and a half. In the lumber industry, the power increased by nearly one-third in just January to April of this year.

* In Luoyang, Henan, the number of textile machine manufacturing plants has increased from only four a month ago to eleven now. There are currently eleven dyeing workshops, two of which can dye more than a thousand bolts of cloth each day. The grinding industry on Xiongwu Street had only two small mills during the enemy occupation, but has now increased to thirty-two. The private Hengdong Flour Mill, which was occupied by the enemy's 206th Division and forced to close, resumed operations on the 10th of last month after the democratic government loaned it more than 20,000 catties of wheat, producing more than 4,000 catties of flour per day. Due to convenient transportation, the bicycle industry has also increased from seven during the enemy occupation to forty. The city opened two new markets on the 3rd of this month. Currently, about 100,000 catties of medicinal materials are transported from Shaanxi and Gansu every day.

* In the four months since Linfen, Shanxi, was liberated, the number of factories and shops has increased from more than 400 to 714, with an additional 1,400 street vendors. Merchants come and go from north to Jinzhong, south to Yuncheng and Luoyang, and west to Hancheng on the west bank of the Yellow River. The metalworking, carpentry, printing, grain, transportation, and cotton weaving industries are the most prosperous. The city's Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Northwest Farmers Bank recently provided loans of 1.061 billion yuan to help 154 factories and shops resume operations.

* Weifang City, Shandong, is actively carrying out public construction. In July, the city's four districts collectively repaired 39 wells, repaired 48 roads, and blocked 32 traffic tunnels dug by the Kuomintang army in the east and west city walls. They also carried out work such as dredging ditches, clearing garbage, repairing sluice gates, and clock towers.

* Xinhua News Agency: In the Jianghan Liberated Area of Hubei, most industrial and commercial enterprises were shut down due to the Kuomintang's conscription and extortion. After liberation, due to biases in the implementation of policies, the market continued to decline for a time. After the government resolutely corrected the deviations in the implementation of industrial and commercial policies and returned or compensated the confiscated industrial and commercial households, the market has now begun to recover, and industry and commerce are gradually recovering. In Xionkou City, Jiangjingqian (a newly established county located between Jiangling, Jingshan, and Qianshan), in addition to the restoration of the original 240 shops, more than 20 more were developed in July, and the number of visiting merchants doubled. In Xiaobanqiao, Xiangzaoyi County (a newly established county), the interests of six merchants were previously violated, and a grocery store was wrongly fined. After full compensation, the market has now completely returned to its former state. In other places, such as Hongshan and Suinan County (newly established counties), industrial and commercial households have also been recruiting workers and resuming operations, and requesting government loans for support.

　　安东大量出产白报纸  临汾铁木工各业兴隆
    ★吉林市公营东建洋灰厂，已于八月一日恢复生产，最高产量日达一百三十四吨，较伪满时产量相差无几。又，吉林市洋灰厂于吉市收复后不久，即恢复制造洋瓦、洋灰，现洋瓦已由最初的日产四百二十张增至一千零五十张。
    ★东北安东造纸厂的已停工四年的一百英寸抄纸机，已经修好，于八月十五日开始大量出产白报纸，钞票纸及卷烟用纸等。辽北造纸厂经数月研究，已大量制造白有光纸。
    ★东北各地工业因电源充足，纷纷增加动力设备。如牡丹江铁工业与一九四六年底比较，机器架数增加了三倍，使用电力增加了十倍。纺织业一年半以来增加动力二十二倍强。制材业仅今年一月至四月，动力即增加了近三分之一。
    ★河南洛阳纺织机制造厂月前仅有四家，现已增至十一家，染坊业现有十一家，其中两家每日各可染布千余匹。熊五街磨坊业，敌占时仅有二家小型磨坊，现增至三十二家。前为敌二○六师所侵占而停业的民营恒东面粉厂，经民主政府贷麦二万余斤，已于上月十日开工，每天出面四千余斤。由于交通便利，自行车业亦由敌占时之七家增至四十家。本月三日该市辟新市场两处。现每日由陕甘运来之药材约十万斤。
    ★山西临汾解放四个月来，工厂商店由四百余家增加到七百十四家，另有摊贩一千四百余户。北至晋中，南至运城、洛阳，西至黄河西岸之韩城，客商来往不断。以铁工、木工、印刷、粮食、运输、棉织等行业最为兴隆。该市工商局及西北农民银行近又贷款十亿六千一百万元，帮助一百五十四家工厂商店复业。
    ★山东潍坊市积极进行公共建设。七月份该市有四个区共修井三十九座，修补道路四十八条，堵塞东西城根国民党军所挖的交通洞三十二个。并进行疏通阴沟、清除垃圾、修水闸、钟楼等工作。
    ★湖北江汉解放区各地工商业因遭国民党拉夫派款，大部停业，解放后又因执行政策中发生偏向，致市场一度继续肃条。经政府坚决纠正执行工商业政策中的偏差，退还或赔偿了被没收的工商户后，市场现已复趋活跃，工商业也正逐渐恢复中。江京潜（新设县，位于江陵京山潜山之间）熊口市，除原有二百四十家商店恢复外，七月份又发展二十多家，来往客商增加一倍。襄枣宜县（新设县）之小板桥前曾侵犯六家商户利益，错罚一家杂货店，经全部赔偿后，现市面已完全恢复旧观。其他如洪山、随南县（新设县）等地工商户，也纷纷招工复业，并请求政府给予贷款扶助。　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
