Criticism and Suggestions

　　Local Governments Should Pay Attention to Consolidating Troop Work
To the Editorial Comrades:
    Recently, the troops have been conducting a large-scale training movement to improve their skills. However, family members of soldiers constantly come to the troops to see their brothers, husbands, or sons. Some family members say that the village is not taking good care of them, and that there are difficulties at home, wanting them to go back and take a look, which has a negative impact on the soldiers. For example, soldier Jia Wenzhong, from Jialü Village, Fourth District, Jing County, Hebei Province, his father came to see him and said that there were difficulties at home and the village was not taking good care of them. Before leaving, he left him a set of civilian clothes, and on the third day he changed into them and left the team. Squad leader Guo Jinsheng, from Wangduan Village, Second District, Xingtai, Hebei Province, his older brother came to see him and said, "Xu Dexian from our village deserted and went home, and nothing happened." Before leaving, he left him a set of civilian clothes, and he then changed into them and ran away.
    Therefore, we suggest: 1. When escaped soldiers return to the local area, the village, district, and county governments at all levels should promptly use various methods to mobilize them to return to the team. They should not ignore them after they are discovered. 2. Local governments at all levels should take care of the families of revolutionary soldiers in various ways and conduct more education. Write more letters to the soldiers to encourage them and report good living conditions at home, so that the soldiers can feel at ease and avoid family worries. 3. Local governments should try their best to mobilize the families of soldiers not to delay production or spend travel expenses, and to visit less and communicate more. If they want to visit, they should be patient in persuading and educating them to ensure that they do not have a bad effect on the troops and that no problems occur.

### 各地政府应注意巩固部队工作

专栏：批评与建议

　　各地政府应注意巩固部队工作编辑同志：
    近来部队为了提高技术，举行大练兵运动，但是部队家属不断到部队来看他们的弟兄，丈夫或儿子，有的家属说村中照顾不好，家中困难等，要他们回去看看，对战士起着不良的影响。如战士贾文中，河北景县四区贾吕村人，他父亲来看他，说家中困难，村上照顾不好，临走给他丢下一套便衣，到第三天他换上就离队了。班长郭金生，河北邢台二区王段村人，他哥哥来看他说：“咱村徐德贤开小差回家，啥事也没有。”临走时给他丢了一套便衣，他随后换上也跑了。
    因此我们建议：一、逃亡战士回到地方上，村、区、县各级政府，应该抓紧用各种办法动员他们归队，不应该在发觉后，对他毫不过问。二、地方各级政府对革命军人家属应多方照顾，多进行教育。对战士多来信鼓励、与报告家中好的生活情况，使战士安心，免掉家庭顾虑。三、地方政府应尽量动员战士家属不必耽误生产、花费盘费，少去看多通信。如要去看，更要耐心说服教育，保证到部队不起坏作用，不发生问题才好。
