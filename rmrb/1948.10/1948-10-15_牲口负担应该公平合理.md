　　Livestock Burden Should Be Fair and Reasonable
Editor:
    I have seen the two communications, "Yanbei Liu Jianzhang Creates Good Methods for Transporting War Support" and "The Unfair Allocation of Scattered Livestock in Yangqu Leads to Many Falling Ill and Decreasing in Number." I think they are very important. Because in many areas now, the lack of animal power is more serious than the lack of manpower. For example, in the Wanxian area, on average, one animal has to plow one to two Qing of land. In some villages, the number of livestock has decreased by 50% to 80% compared to before the war. This lack of animal power seriously affects agricultural production and support-the-front work. The reasons for this are: on the one hand, the livestock bought with the equal-share neutralization loan is too dispersed, resulting in only using them without feeding them, and the livestock die as a result. On the other hand, there is serious waste in war support and the people's burden is too heavy. However, only starting from these two reasons cannot solve the fundamental problem. Because now even livestock that is not collectively fed is being sold off, and war service is still very important according to the needs of future wars. To solve the fundamental problem, we should start with fair burden-sharing. The main unfair phenomenon existing today is the unfairness between those who have livestock and those who don't: those who have livestock provide livestock, and those who don't provide nothing. Now, during the autumn grain transport, which takes half a month back and forth, those who have livestock go out to transport grain, and those who don't stay at home to harvest. In Wangdu, when organizing war support cooperatives, households with livestock have to contribute funds to the war support cooperative in addition to bearing the service burden (because the war support cooperative is to reduce the service burden for households with livestock), creating a seriously unreasonable phenomenon. In previous years, most livestock-raising households were landlords and rich peasants, and implementing the policy of livestock owners providing livestock was reasonable. But now, especially after equal distribution, most of those who raise livestock are honest farmers. They raise livestock to cultivate the land and engage in some transportation side occupations, so the burden of livestock is all placed on these people. The more livestock sold, the heavier the remaining burden. Now many livestock distributed to poor peasants have also been sold, resulting in a large decrease in livestock. Although this year's unified progressive tax stipulates one exemption point per livestock, which is reasonable, I also believe that the specific solution is to expand the burden-sharing scope and change the unreasonable burden-sharing method of livestock owners providing livestock and non-livestock owners providing nothing, and instead use the method of burdening livestock war service according to wealth. If livestock-raising households contribute more labor, wages can be paid during the calculation of total labor hours; non-livestock-raising households can hire livestock or allocate labor to exchange for livestock for business trips, otherwise they should take out the owed wages when calculating total labor hours. (Of course, special difficult households can be appropriately taken care of and exempted.) In this way, the burden on livestock-raising households is reduced, and the phenomenon of uneven distribution of burden is changed. Farmers will naturally not sell livestock anymore, and the livestock in the liberated areas can be greatly increased. This issue deserves our deep attention. Now the masses are more concerned about the livestock burden problem than the public grain burden (because the public grain burden has been reasonably resolved, and the masses are very satisfied). I am submitting this issue as a suggestion for all parties to study.
　　Wang Guozhen

    The problem raised by Comrade Guozhen is very important. If it is not resolved well, it will not only affect support-the-front work, but also greatly hinder the development of rural productive forces. Recently, many regions have been paying attention to solving this, which is very good. The leadership in various places should be concerned about this urgent demand of the masses and give it a fair and reasonable solution, which is of great importance to the restoration and improvement of rural production.

### 牲口负担应该公平合理

　　牲口负担应该公平合理编辑同志：
    我看到“延属刘建章创造运输战勤好办法”和“阳曲的出差不公分配零散牲口大批病倒减少”的两篇通信，我认为十分重要。因为现在许多地区，畜力的缺乏，比人力缺乏还要严重，如完县一带，有的村一个牲口平均要耕一顷到两顷的土地，若干乡村牲口较战前减少了百分之五十至百分之八十。这种缺乏畜力的现象，严重的影响着农业生产和支前工作。其原因：一方面是平分中和贷款买的牲口太分散，形成光使不喂，结果把牲口喂死了。一方面是战勤的严重浪费，人民负担过重。但是仅从这两个原因出发，仍然解决不了根本问题。因为现在不是伙喂的牲口也卖掉了，而战争勤务根据今后战争的需要仍然是很重要的，解决根本问题，应从负担公平着手。今天存在的负担不公现象，主要是有牲口的和没牲口的不公，有牲口的出牲口，没牲口的就不出。如今秋大运粮，往返半月，有牲口的出去运粮，无牲口的在家收秋。在望都，组织战勤社，有牲口户除负担勤务外，还要出战勤社的资金（因为战勤社是给有牲口户减轻勤务的），造成严重不合理的现象。前几年养牲口户多为地主富农，实行有牲口出牲口的负担政策是合理的。但现在，特别经过平分以后，喂牲口的多是老实农民，他们喂牲口是为了种地和搞些运输副业，所以牲口的负担都压到了这些人的头上。卖牲口的越多剩下的负担越重。现在许多贫农分的牲口也已卖掉了，因而造成牲口大量减少。虽然今年统累税规定一个牲口除一个免征点，这是合理的。同时我认为具体解决办法，只有扩大负担面，改变有牲口出牲口，没牲口不出的不合理的负担办法，改用按富力负担牲口战勤的办法。喂牲口户出工多了，齐工时可发给工资；不喂牲口户可雇牲口或拨工换牲口出差，不然在齐工时应当拿出所欠之工资。（当然对特殊困难户可适当照顾减免）这样一来，减轻了喂牲口户的负担，改变了负担上苦乐不均的现象。农民自然不会再出卖牲口，解放区的牲口，才可能大量增加。这问题值得我们深切的注意。现在群众关心牲口负担问题比关心公粮负担还迫切（因公粮负担已得到合理解决，群众都很满意）。特把这个问题作为一个建议。提供各方研究。
　　王国振
    国振同志提的这个问题很重要，如不很好解决，不但影响支前，农村生产力的发展也将大受妨碍。最近不少地区都在注意解决，这是很好的。各地领导上应关切群众这一迫切要求，予以公平合理的解决，这对农村生产的恢复和提高有极大关系。
