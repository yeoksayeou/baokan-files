Hebei-Shandong-Henan Cultural Circles Gather

Discuss Work Guidelines and Elect Federation of Literary and Art Circles Directors

★ The Propaganda Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee convened a meeting of cultural circles on September 10th. The meeting lasted five days. Participating units included the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the District Party Committee's Cultural Work Troupe, the Second Prefectural Commissioner's Office Cultural Work Troupe, the Folk Art Federation, the Folk Art Theater, the Zhan You (Comrades) Newspaper, the Bookstore Editorial Department, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily, the Pingyuan (Plain) Publishing House, the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Middle Schools, and the Jianguo (National Construction) College. At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Chen Yueping from the Bookstore spoke first. He affirmed the achievements of the past cultural and educational work and proposed that on the basis of the original work, cultural work should be enlivened to break the current state of cultural work's inactivity. Subsequently, the participants were divided into editing and publishing groups, performance groups, and education groups for discussion according to their respective units. On the third day of the meeting, Comrade Shen Yunpu, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, gave a report. He talked about the future work guidelines, saying: "From the actual movement, it is very clear that the vast majority of cadres, teachers, and middle school students lack reading materials, and the emancipated masses urgently need cultural nourishment. Therefore, cultural creation is the main task at present, and cultural workers are required to write good literature and art, good scripts, good songs, and good self-study series." When talking about the issue of creation, he pointed out: "When you pick up your pen to write something, you must first clarify the purpose of writing - what problem are you writing to solve. Cultural work is a political duty, that is, when we publicize and implement a specific policy of the Party, we must not forget the Party's general line, general policy, and general guidelines." He called on "every cultural worker to study the Party's policies and lines and correctly implement them. In creative work, we must also use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism like other work. Furthermore, mass character and popularization are still the direction for cultural workers to strive for." When talking about organizational leadership issues, he put forward the principle of "unified leadership," with all cultural work led by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles; future publishing and editing work will be unified under the Bookstore Editorial Department. First, the Pingyuan Half-Monthly publication will be restored to solve the problems of cadre study and guidance work. Finally, he conveyed a report against empiricism, hoping that everyone would reflect on and examine themselves in connection with their past work. After the report, each group discussed the organizational form and future work separately. On the fifth day of the meeting, Minister Shen gave a concluding speech, pointing out: "The leadership of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles over cultural work is to play the role of exchanging information, exchanging experience, promoting achievements, and correcting deviations." Subsequently, the first council of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles was formally elected. The seven comrades were: Wang Yaping, Chen Yueping, Xing Libin, Zhang Mingquan, Zhang Guochu, Sun Hong, and Zhang Fuchen.

　　冀鲁豫文化界集会
    讨论工作方针选出文联理事
    ★冀鲁豫区党委宣传部于九月十日召开文化界会议。会议历时五天。与会单位有文联、区党委文工团、二专署文工团、民间艺术联合会、民艺剧社、战友报社、书店编辑部，冀鲁豫日报社、平原社、一、二、三、四中学及建国学院。会议开始，首先由书店陈越平同志发言，他肯定了过去文化教育工作的成绩，并提出要在原有工作基础上，使文化工作活跃起来，打破目前文化工作的消沉状态。随后即按与会单位分为编刊组、演唱组、教育组进行讨论。会议第三天，区党委宣传部长申云浦同志作报告。他谈到今后的工作方针说：“从实际运动中看的很明显，广大干部，教员，中学生，都缺乏读物，翻身群众迫切需要文化食粮，所以目前文化创作是主要的，要求文化工作者写出好的文艺、好的剧本、好的歌曲、好的自修丛书”。谈到创作上的问题时指出：“当你提笔写东西时，首先要明确写作的目的——为解决什么问题而写。文化工作为政治职务，就是当我们宣传贯澈党的某种具体政策时，就不要忘掉党的总路线总政策总方针。”号召“每一个文化工作者要学习党的政策路线，正确的贯彻执行。在创作工作上，也要和其他工作一样运用批评与自我批评的武器。再则，大众化通俗化还是文化工作者努力的方向”。谈到组织领导问题时，提出“统一领导”的方针，一切文化工作均由文联领导；今后的出版编辑工作，则统一在书店编辑部。首先恢复平原半月刊，解决干部学习和指导工作的问题。最后又传达了反经验主义的报告，希望大家联系过去工作反省检查自己。报告后，各组分头讨论组织形式与今后工作。会议第五天，由申部长作总结发言，指出：“文联对文化工作的领导是要起到互通情报交流经验，发扬成绩纠正偏向的作用。”随后正式选出文联第一届理事会理事。计有：王亚平、陈越平、邢立斌、张明权、张国础、孙洪、张富忱七同志。
