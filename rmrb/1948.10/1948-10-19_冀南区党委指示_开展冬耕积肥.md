　　Ji'nan District Party Committee Directs
　　Launch Winter Ploughing and Manure Accumulation
　　[Ji'nan Electric] In order to launch winter ploughing, manure accumulation, and sideline production in disaster areas, the Ji'nan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions, which stated in brief: The central task from now until next year's spring ploughing is to complete land reform, party rectification, and the establishment of political power. However, these tasks must be combined with autumn ploughing, manure accumulation, and winter-spring sideline production. We must give the masses time for winter ploughing, manure accumulation, and the development of sideline occupations. We must ensure that each of our work steps and policy implementations are conducive to next year's major production. Some villages and districts with smaller land reform tasks can increase the weight of production, adopting a method of producing during the day and holding meetings at night. If land reform has already been completed, the focus can immediately shift to production. Disaster areas should focus on self-salvation through production, but it is very necessary to resolve land rights, and in areas where land rights can be fixed, this should be combined with the issuance of land certificates or the classification of class status, in order to boost production enthusiasm. We must be good at grasping the needs of the masses according to different situations, and creating various combined methods to promote work.
　　In the autumn and winter production work, we must seize the important links of winter ploughing and manure accumulation. In recent years, sowing has not been timely, and insect plagues have occurred continuously. Failure to carry out winter ploughing well is a major reason. Therefore, in the future, we should conduct extensive and in-depth winter ploughing mobilization among the broad masses, dispel all ideological concerns of the masses, earnestly implement the administrative office's instructions on wheat planting regarding the handling of already cultivated land during supplementary planting, and promote the voluntary combination of small-scale mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of lacking manpower and animal power based on the principle of equivalent exchange. Regarding manure accumulation, the instructions require cadres to adopt the mass line, research and create various methods of manure accumulation. For example, collecting more manure, digging manure pits, utilizing urine fertilizer, raising pigs, building pens, processing oil, milling flour, restoring sideline occupations, increasing livestock, promoting brick making, demolishing kang beds, demolishing broken houses, and digging street soil, etc. Ji'nan Jianhua Company and stores in various special counties should try to organize coal ash stores, develop mass transportation, organize the transportation of ash, promote stove improvements, and lead farmers in formulating production increase plans, using various sideline occupations to increase income and increase fertilizer.

　　冀南区党委指示
  　开展冬耕积肥
    【冀南电】为开展冬耕积肥及灾区副业生产，中共冀南区党委特发出指示，略称：目前至明年春耕其中心任务为完成土改、整党、建政。但这些工作必须与秋耕、积肥、冬春副业生产相结合。必须给群众以冬耕、积肥、发展副业的时间。必须使我们各个工作步骤与政策的实施有利于明年的大生产。有些村、区土改任务不大，即可加重生产的份量，采取白天生产晚上开会。如土改业已完成，可即转入生产。灾区则以生产自救为主，但很需要解决地权与可以固定地权的地区，应结合颁发土地证，或划阶级，以提高生产情绪。要善于根据不同情况，掌握群众需要，多方创造结合办法，以推动工作。
    秋冬两季生产工作，必须抓紧冬耕与积肥这个重要环节。历年来播种不够及时，虫灾不断发生，未能很好进行冬耕是个很大原因。为此，今后应在广大群众中，广泛深入的进行冬耕动员，解除群众一切思想顾虑，认真执行行署种麦指示中关于抽补时对已耕土地的处理办法，并推动群众自愿结合小型互助，以等价交换的原则来解决人畜力缺乏的困难。关于积肥，该指示要求干部采取群众路线，研究创造各种积肥办法。例如多拾粪，挖粪坑，利用尿肥，养猪，垒圈，打油，磨粉，恢复副业，增加牲口，提倡打坯，拆炕，拆破房，挖街土等。冀南建华公司和各专县的商店，应设法组织煤灰店，发展群众运输，组织运灰，提倡改灶，并领导农民订增产计划，用各种副业增加收入，增加肥料。
