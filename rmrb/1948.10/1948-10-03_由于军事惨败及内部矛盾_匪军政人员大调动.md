Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that due to military defeats and numerous internal contradictions, the Kuomintang government's military and political personnel have undergone a large-scale reshuffle in the past month. First, in the Central Plains, after the Kuomintang government suffered repeated defeats in the Kaifeng, Eastern Henan, and Yanzhou campaigns, it greatly adjusted the military and political organizations in the region. On August 12th, Du Yuming, who had been dismissed from his post after suffering successive defeats in the Northeast, was appointed as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the "Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters." On the 4th of this month, he was also ordered to concurrently serve as the "Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters Forward Command," stationed in Zhengzhou, with Sun Yuanliang as his deputy. The position of the puppet governor of Henan Province was assigned to Zhang Zhen, the commander of the 5th Pacification Zone in Xinyang, formerly a subordinate of Cheng Qian and Tang Enbo, on August 26th, replacing Liu Maoen. After Kang Ze was captured in the Xiangfan campaign, Chiang Kai-shek appointed Song Xilian, the former commander of the Xinjiang Garrison, as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Bai Chongxi's "Central China Pacification Headquarters" on September 4th, based in Xiangyang, to rule over northern Hubei and southern Henan. The position of the puppet governor of Anhui Province, which falls within the scope of the "Central China Pacification Headquarters," has been replaced by Xia Wei, a close associate of Li and Bai and the former commander of the 8th Pacification Zone, replacing Li Pinsian.

In addition, the Kuomintang's military and political personnel changes also include: Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, was renamed Director of the Northwest Military and Political Affairs Office on August 12th; Guan Linzheng was appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army on August 6th (formerly Fan Hanjie); Sun Liren, the commander of the Kuomintang government's Army Training Command of the Ministry of National Defense, who was cultivated by the United States, was appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army and retained his original position on September 1st; on the same day, Cheng Qian was appointed Director of the Changsha Pacification Office; Zhu Shaoliang was appointed Director of the Chongqing Pacification Office; Tang Enbo was appointed Director of the Quzhou Pacification Office; Song Ziwen was appointed Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Office; Ding Zhipan was appointed Chairman of Jiangsu Province; on September 15th, Li Liangrong, the commander of the 23rd Army and former commander of the 9th Pacification Zone in Linyi, Shandong, who had also been stationed in Taiwan, was appointed Chairman of Fujian Province (formerly Liu Jianxu).

　　由于军事惨败及内部矛盾
    匪军政人员大调动
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合各方消息：由于军事惨败及内部矛盾重重，国民党政府军政人员月来大批调动。首先在中原，国民党政府于开封、豫东及兖州诸战役处处溃败后，大加调整该区军政机构，八月十二日将前在东北连战皆败而被撤职的杜聿明委派为“徐州剿总”副总司令；本月四日又命其兼任“徐州剿总前进指挥部主任”，驻守郑州，并以孙元良副之。河南伪省主席一职，则于八月二十六日委派信阳第五绥区司令原程潜、汤恩伯部属张轸，以代替刘茂恩。襄樊之战康泽被俘后，蒋贼于九月四日委派原新疆警备总司令宋希濂为白崇禧的“华中剿总”副总司令，踞守襄阳，统治鄂北、豫南地区。属于“华中剿总”范围的安徽伪省主席一职，已由李、白嫡系原第八绥区司令夏威代替李品仙。
    此外，国民党军政人事变动尚有：西北行辕主任张治中八月十二日改任西北军政长官；关麟征八月六日被任陆军副总司令（原为范汉杰）；美国一手培植的国民党政府国防部陆军训练司令孙立人九月一日被任为陆军副总司令兼原职；同日程潜被任为长沙绥署主任；朱绍良为重庆绥署主任；汤恩伯为衢州绥署主任；宋子文为广州绥署主任；丁治磐为江苏省主席；九月十五日委原山东临沂第九绥区司令二十三军军长并曾驻扎台湾的李良荣为福建省主席（原为刘建绪）。
