Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 23rd: Reports from various sources indicate that the Indonesian People's Army continues to wage guerrilla warfare in central and eastern Java. According to an Associated Press report, fierce fighting has been taking place in the Cipeu oil region north of Madiun, which has changed hands three times and is currently still occupied by the People's Army. The People's Army is also advancing towards Cepu, east of Cipeu. There is also fighting in Blora, north of Cipeu, and Wonogiri, west of Madiun. At the same time, the People's Army is showing a tendency to expand into Dutch-occupied areas. A Hatta government communique stated that the People's Army had crossed the "ceasefire line" between the Hatta government and the Netherlands and was operating in the Dutch-occupied areas on the north coast of Central Java. According to a TASS report citing the Dutch "Modern News," the Hatta reactionary army's discipline is deteriorating, and many units of the Hatta army are defecting to the People's Army.

Due to the development of the Indonesian people's armed struggle, the American reactionaries, in addition to strengthening the Dutch army stationed in Indonesia with arms supplies, are also urging the Hatta government to end its bargaining dispute with the Netherlands. According to an Agence France-Presse report citing the Hatta government's news agency, the head of the U.S. delegation to the "Mediation" Committee submitted a new U.S. proposal put forward by the U.S. State Department and the Netherlands' amendments to the proposal to Yogyakarta on the 15th. It is claimed that this proposal may end the stalemate in negotiations between the Netherlands and the Hatta government. The new proposal is based on the Renville Agreement and the U.S.-Australian plan. Note: The U.S.-Australian plan was put forward in mid-June, stipulating that the Hatta government hand over sovereign powers such as military power, diplomacy, finance, trade, and foreign exchange supervision, which would be taken over by a so-called temporary federal government controlled by the Netherlands. This plan was accepted by the Hatta government, but was abandoned because the Netherlands was not satisfied at the time.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 17th: According to a TASS report citing a reporter from the Czech Free Speech, the United States and Britain have recently increased their supply of weapons and military materials to the Dutch army stationed in Indonesia. In the first half of September, the Dutch army stationed in Indonesia received at least 50 aircraft, 80 tanks, 80,000 rifles, 200 medium-caliber artillery pieces, 5,000 light machine guns and Thompson submachine guns, 500 trucks carrying spare parts, 80 radio stations, and a large number of other military equipment from Britain and the United States. During the same period, 50,000 sets of military uniforms and numerous trucks were shipped from Malaya and India. The reporter also stated that the United States has dispatched a large number of Japanese officers to Indonesia to serve as instructors for the Dutch army stationed in Indonesia.

Like Britain, the United States' active support for the Dutch invasion of Indonesia is also to clear the way for its own monopoly capital to expand. According to a Dentsu News Agency report from New York, 30 major American companies will "rebuild" Indonesia under a contract to be signed with the Dutch government. This agreement is an important part of the United States' attempt to establish a new economic empire in Southeast Asia under the guise of its satellite countries (Britain, France, and the Netherlands) clamoring for "anti-communism." Note: Of the total of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment in Indonesia, the United States accounts for 1 billion, Britain 500 million, the Netherlands 400 million, and France 200 million. American investment in Indonesia began in 1921, but only increased sharply in the years before World War II due to the weakening of Dutch and British power. Subsequently, Mobil Oil Company established five large oil refineries in Sumatra and Java, American Rubber Company owned millions of acres of rubber plantations, and Ford Company had exclusive automobile sales rights.

　　印尼人民军继续进行游击战
  　茉莉芬以北战斗激烈
  　哈达军许多部队投奔到人民军方面
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方报导：印尼人民军在爪哇中部和东部继续进行游击战。据美联社消息称：茉莉芬以北芝普油区战事激烈，曾三易其手，现仍在人民军占领下。人民军并向芝普以东的新浦头逼进。芝普以北之布洛拉与茉莉芬以西之乌诺基利均有战事。同时人民军并有向荷占区发展之势，哈达政府公报称：人民军曾越过哈达政府与荷兰的“休战线”，活动到中爪哇北岸荷军侵占区去。据塔斯社引荷兰“现代新闻”消息：哈达反动军军纪日趋败坏，哈达军的许多部队纷纷投奔到人民军方面来。
    由于印尼人民武装斗争的发展，美国反动派除了加强以军火供应驻印尼的荷军以外，正促使哈达政府结束与荷兰间讨价还价式的争执。据法新社引哈达政府通讯社消息：“调处”委员会美代表团团长于十五日向日惹方面递交由美国国务院提出的美国新建议案及荷兰对于该建议的修正案。据称：这一建议案可能结束荷兰与哈达政府之间谈判的僵局。新建议案系根据伦维尔协定与美澳方案。按：美澳方案系于六月中旬提出，规定哈达政府交出军权、外交、财政贸易与监督外汇等主权，由设立一个荷兰控制下的所谓临时联邦政府接管之。该方案曾被哈达政府接受，仅因当时荷兰还不满足而告罢。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社引捷克自由言论报记者报导：最近美英增加了对驻印尼荷军的武器与军事物资的供应。在九月上半月内，驻印尼的荷军从英美手里至少收到了五十架飞机、八十辆坦克、八万支步枪、二百门中等口径的大炮、五千挺轻机枪及汤姆式机枪、五百辆载有零件的卡车、八十部无线电台、及大量其他军备。在同一期间，曾有五万套军装及众多卡车从马来亚与印度起运。该记者并称：美国已派遣大批日本军官至印尼，充当驻印尼的荷军的教官。
    和英国一样，美国之积极支持荷军对印尼的侵略，也是为了替本国垄断资本扫清扩张的道路。据电通社纽约讯：美国三十家大公司将根据即将与荷兰政府签订的合同来进行“重建”印尼。该协议是美国以其英、法、荷卫星国的“反共”叫嚣为掩护，企图在东南亚建立一个新的经济帝国的重要部分。按在印尼总额二十五亿美元的外国投资中，美国占十亿，英国占五亿，荷兰占四亿，法国占两亿。美国对印尼的投资开始于一九二一年，但到第二次世界大战前几年才因为荷英势力的削弱而骤增。其后，美孚煤油公司在苏门答腊和爪哇建立了五家大炼油厂，美国橡皮公司拥有百万英亩的橡胶园，福特公司有着汽车专卖权。
