　　[Jinan Telegram] In Gucheng, the wheat planting plan was not completed due to the lack of specific and in-depth leadership from cadres. According to a survey of five villages in the Second District, in Cuizhuang, only 1,500 mu of wheat were planted out of 2,830 mu of existing land. In Dongsanwu, only 800 mu of wheat were planted out of 3,714 mu of existing land. In Qianmengting, only 667 mu were planted out of 2,132.9 mu. In Chenzhuang, only 433 mu were planted out of 1,450 mu. In Nanwangzhuang, only 1,533.5 mu were planted out of 36,449.1 mu. From the above statistics, wheat planting in four-fifths of the villages is less than 50%, and in some cases only 21.5%. The main reason for the failure to plant a large amount of wheat this year, despite adequate and timely rainfall, is that district and village cadres, after a general mobilization and appeal, believed that the policy of "whoever plants, harvests" had been publicized and that the masses had no concerns. In reality, the masses' understanding of our Party's policies is still insufficient, and their doubts have not been completely eliminated. Without in-depth, specific leadership in each village and household, many difficulties faced by the masses, such as lack of labor, fertilizer, and seeds, could not be resolved. The arrangements only called for leading the masses to launch a concentrated wheat planting effort, without clear plans or tasks. Therefore, it was not possible to lead the masses in a planned and targeted manner to strive for more planting, and the wheat planting work was limited to a general appeal, missing a favorable opportunity. The county government recently studied the above situation and emphasized overcoming the complacency of cadres, and decided: First, mobilize the masses to carry out emergency replanting, explaining that there is still time for planting this year due to the heavy rain. Second, based on the wheat planting situation in different villages, put forward specific requirements for replanting. General villages should reach 50%, and strive to plant more. Third, district and village cadres should conduct serious and in-depth inspections, and specifically help each village and household solve difficulties: (1) For those with difficulties in seeds, help the masses find relatives and friends to borrow from, with coarse grains deducted internally, and village cadres should help the masses coordinate solutions. (2) For those with difficulties in fertilizer, persuade the masses to apply top dressing after planting or collect fertilizer next spring, and seize the time to plant now. (3) For those with difficulties in labor, call on the masses to help each other and repay in equivalent labor exchange in the future.
　　(Leaders should pay attention to wheat planting, in addition to general appeals, and it is necessary and correct to grasp specific leadership. However, it should be noted that autumn wheat sowing has an objective and certain limit, for example, in southern Hebei it generally should not exceed 30% of the cultivated land area. Therefore, leaders should also pay attention not to form a mandatory order in order to complete the subjectively prescribed task, which is even more harmful. -- Editor)

　　故城领导种麦不深入
  　县府决定动员群众紧急补种
    【冀南电】故城由于干部领导不具体不深入，使种麦计划未完成。据二区五个村调查，崔庄原有地二八三零亩，只种麦一五零零亩；东三务原有地三七一四亩，只种麦八零零亩；前孟町二一三二点九亩，仅种了六六七亩；陈庄原有地一四五零亩，只种四三三亩；南王庄原有地三六四四九点一亩，只种一五三三点五亩。从以上统计看，五分之四的村庄种麦不足百分之五十，有的仅占百分之廿一点五。该区今年雨足应时，而不能大量种麦的主要原因是：区村干部经过一般推动号召后，认为谁种谁收的政策宣传了，群众没有顾虑了，实际上群众对我党政策了解还很不够，疑虑没完全消除。没有深入一村一户具体领导，而很多群众缺乏劳力、肥料、种籽等困难不能解决。布置时也只布置了带领群众突击种麦，没有明确计划与任务，因此不能有计划地有目标地领导群众争取多种，使种麦工作仅限于一般号召，放过了有利时机。县府最近研究了以上情况，着重提出克服干部自满情绪，并决定：第一，动员群众进行紧急补种，说明今年雨大，仍有赶种条件。第二，根据不同村庄的种麦情形，提出补种具体要求，一般村要达到百分之五十，并尽力争取多种。第三，区村干部要认真深入检查，具体帮助一村一户解决困难：（一）种籽困难的，应帮助群众想法找亲友借贷，粗粮折内，村干部应帮助群众调剂解决。（二）肥料困难的，可劝群众种上以后追肥或明年春天拾肥，现在先抓紧种上。（三）劳力困难的，号召群众互相帮忙，将来用换工的方法等价补还。
    （领导上注意种麦，除一般号召外，并且抓紧具体领导是必要的，正确的。但应注意，秋麦播种是有客观的一定的限度的，比如冀南一般不能超过耕地面积的百分之三十。因此领导上同时应注意不要为了完成主观规定的任务，而形成强迫命令，其害更大。——编者）
