(Taihang Electric) Since the start of the busy autumn season, various localities have organized large numbers of women to participate in production, given the great difficulty in manpower and animal power due to supporting the war effort. In many areas, even housewives who previously had no habit of working in the fields have gone to the fields. According to partial statistics from 85 villages in 12 counties including Licheng, Heshun, and Wuxiang, nearly 10,000 women have participated in the autumn harvest activities. In the first and fourth districts of Licheng, 39 villages alone have 1,636 women participating in the autumn harvest. In addition to preparing clothes and shoes for men participating in the war, and cooking and taking care of children without neglecting household chores, they have harvested more than 3,400 mu of land. In the sixth district, women have completed more than half of the autumn harvest tasks. In many places, this autumn, there has been a division of labor between men and women, with women reaping, men carrying, women chopping, men threshing, women collecting, and men plowing, enabling women to independently shoulder the autumn harvest work. The result of such a rational use of labor is that it not only gives full play to the labor efficiency of women, but also solves the contradiction of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting being squeezed together. The participation of women in the autumn harvest this year has broken the past conventions and changed the habit of only doing light work such as harvesting. Women in many places have made attempts to do heavy work. Shi Fengqin, a woman from Dameng Village in Neiqiu, drives a cart to transport manure, surpassing men. Chen Xiaoping and Tian Chunzhi, two women from Houyanwa Plateau in Lincheng, exchanged labor and carried back grain from five mu of land two li away from the village in half a day. Chen Xiaoping alone carried more than 30 loads of manure a day. There are 37 women in this village who participated in heavy work this autumn. In Shexian, most of the threshing is done by women. According to contributions from various localities, the main experiences in mobilizing women to participate in agricultural activities this autumn are the relatively universal attention to women's mutual aid and family combination, and the rational use of labor according to the work and work points. Prioritizing one's own work before others, not emphasizing tasks that cannot be done, and settling work points when work is finished, thus gaining family support and women's approval. Secondly, in order to fully mobilize women to participate in agricultural production from a long-term perspective, it is also very important and should be paid close attention to in the future to implement technical guidance and change the old style of family leadership. Wang Qiuze of Nanguan, Changzhi, used rewards to motivate three women in his family to work in the fields. From spring plowing and sowing to weeding and summer harvest, he not only did not hire short-term workers as in previous years, but also earned wages for weeding for others. The money earned was not taken by the family, but was owned privately by the women. He also made a single set of clothes for each of the three women, and bought each of them a straw hat and a towel, which further encouraged the women's enthusiasm for working in the fields, and the family became more harmonious.

　　太行各地秋收中
  　广大妇女踊跃参加劳动
    【太行电】秋忙以来，各地在参战支前劳畜力十分困难的情况下，均大批的组织了妇女劳力投入生产。不少地区素无上地劳动习惯的家庭妇女，也都上了地。根据黎城、和顺、武乡等十二县八十五个村的片断材料统计，有将近一万个妇女参加了秋忙活动。黎城一、四区卅九个村，即有一千六百三十六个妇女参加秋收。除准备衣服鞋袜不误男人参战和烧饭看孩不误家庭杂活外，只上地割秋即达三千四百余亩。六区秋收一半以上任务是妇女完成的。许多地方在今秋进行了男女分工，女割男担女切男打女收男耕等，使妇女独当一面的担负起秋收工作。这样的合理使用劳力的结果，既发挥了妇女的劳动效率，而且解决了秋收秋耕种麦等工作挤在一起的矛盾。今秋妇女参加秋忙活动，打破了过去的惯例，改变了只是收割等一般做轻活的习惯。不少地方的妇女进行了做重活的尝试，内邱大孟村妇女石凤琴赶车拉粪赛过男人。临城后砚凹台陈小平、田春芝等三个妇女换工，半天担回离村二里远的五亩地谷。陈小平一人一天担粪三十余担。这个村今秋参加做重活的妇女即有三十七人。涉县打场多半是妇女担任。根据各地来稿，今秋在发动妇女参加农事活动中的主要经验是较普遍的注意了妇女互助与家庭结合，及按活计工合理使用劳力等问题。先自己而后别人，做不了的活不强调，有工顶工余工即清，因而得到家庭拥护妇女赞成。其次为了从长期着眼，充分发动妇女参加农业生产，贯彻技术指导，与改变家庭领导的旧作风，也是非常重要而今后应十分注意的问题。长治南关王秋则用奖励方法动员了家里三个妇女上地劳作，从春耕下种到锄苗夏收，不但没有象往年雇用短工，且给别人锄苗赚回工资。赚回的钱家里没有要，作为妇女私有。并给三个妇女每人做了一身单衣，各买一顶草帽一条毛巾，因而更加鼓励了妇女上地的热情，家庭也更趋和睦。
