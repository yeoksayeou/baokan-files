　　The Northeast is Almost Completely Liberated
　　For Blackboard Newspapers
　　After the People's Liberation Army captured Jinzhou on October 15th, blocking the escape route of the Chiang bandit troops in the Northeast, the Kuomintang army's 60th Army, defending Changchun, revolted on the 17th and handed over the area they were guarding to the People's Liberation Army. By the 19th, Zheng Dongguo, the highest commander of the enemy in Changchun, was unwilling to fight any longer and led the New 7th Army and all the Kuomintang armed forces in Changchun to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. With this, Changchun was completely liberated. It was the first time that the Kuomintang troops defending the city surrendered en masse, led by their senior commanders. From this event, it can be seen that the overall war situation in China has undergone a great change, and the complete liberation of the nine provinces of the Northeast is not far off.

　　东北快完全解放了
    供黑板报用
    解放军十月十五号打下锦州，把东北蒋匪逃跑的路堵死以后，十七号守长春的国民党军第六十军起义，把他们守的地方交给解放军接管。到十九号，长春敌人的最高指挥官郑洞国也不愿再打了，领着新七军和长春所有的国民党武装，向解放军缴械投降。这样一来，长春就完全解放了。国民党守城的军队由高级指挥官领头全体投降，这是头一回。从这件事可以看出来，全中国的战争局面已经有了很大变化，关东九省完全解放的时候不远了。
