Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: The Shandong People's Liberation Army successively recovered the important town of Linyi in southern Shandong and the key port city of Yantai in Jiaodong on the 10th and 15th of this month. Now, the entire Shandong province, except for a few isolated county towns such as Qingdao and Jimo in the east, Yixian and Tancheng in the south, and Caoxian and Yutai in the southwest, has been liberated.
    Note: Linyi City was the former capital of the Shandong Liberated Area, and Yantai is a well-known seaport in the country. The People's Liberation Army withdrew from these cities on February 15, 1947, and October 1 of the same year, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Shaanxi Front, 16th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 7,000 of Hu's bandit reinforcement troops in the area north of Dali between the 11th and 13th. This is another victory for the People's Liberation Army following the annihilation of the majority of Hu's bandit's two reorganized divisions on the 6th and 7th. After suffering a disastrous defeat on the 6th and 7th, Hu Zongnan hastily transferred approximately ten main brigades, totaling the reorganized 1st Division, the reorganized 65th Division, the reorganized 76th Division, and the remnants of the reorganized 36th Division, from Fuping, Yaoxian, Xingping, Baoji, and Tongguan on the 11th. They concentrated in an area of approximately thirty li in length and width northwest of Dali, attempting to engage in a decisive battle with the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army then, between the 11th and 13th, surrounded the reorganized 65th Division in the Lijiapo, Dahaoying, and East and West Hancun areas, thirty li north of Dali City, and dealt it a devastating blow, inflicting heavy casualties on the reorganized 1st Division and the remnants of the reorganized 36th Division. According to preliminary statistics, in three days, more than 7,600 officers and soldiers, including the commander of the 560th Regiment of the reorganized 65th Division, Feng Zhifu, were killed, wounded, or captured, bringing the total number of enemies annihilated to more than 23,600. During the operations, the People's Liberation Army shot down two enemy planes and destroyed four tanks.

　　山东收复临沂烟台陕中续歼胡匪七千
    【新华社华东十六日电】山东解放军于本月十日与十五日先后收复鲁南重镇临沂及胶东要港烟台市。现山东全省除东部的青岛、即墨，南部的峄县、郯城，西南部的曹县、鱼台等少数孤立县城外，均已获得解放。
    按：临沂城为前山东解放区首府，烟台则为全国著名海港，解放军系于一九四七年二月十五日与同年十月一日先后撤离。
    【新华社陕中前线十六日电】西北人民解放军在大荔以北地区十一日至十三日间又歼灭了胡匪增援部队七千余人。这是解放军继六、七两日歼灭胡匪两个整编师大部后的又一胜利。胡宗南自遭六、七两日的惨败后，十一日又仓皇自富平、耀县、兴平、宝鸡及潼关等地，调集整一师、整六十五师、整七十六师及整三十六师残部等共约十个主力旅兵力，集中在大荔西北长宽各约三十余里的地区，图与解放军进行主力决战。解放军当于十一日至十三日间，分别在大荔城北三十里的李家坡、大壕营、东西汉村一带，包围其整六十五师，予以歼灭性打击，并予整一师及整三十六师残部以重大杀伤。据初步统计，三日中毙伤俘匪整六十五师五六零团团长冯植夫等以下官兵七千六百余名，连前共歼敌二万三千六百余名。解放军在作战中，击落飞机两架，击毁坦克四辆。
