　　Introducing a Good Novel
    ——“Gao Qianda”
    By Ouyang Shan, published by North China Xinhua Bookstore, Zhao Shuli

　　“Gao Qianda” is a novel written by Comrade Ouyang Shan in 1946 against subjectivism and bureaucracy. The story in the book is like this: —

　　In 1936, a cooperative was established in Renjiagou Village. Because the director, Ren Changyou, didn't understand the needs of the masses, it not only failed to develop after five years, but also suffered losses. Every year, he relied on administrative orders from the district to force the masses to contribute shares, which was opposed by countless people. The deputy director, Gao Shengliang (also known as Gao Qianda), was a traveling peddler who understood the contradiction between the cooperative and the masses and was determined to change Ren Changyou's ideas, but he couldn't get Ren Changyou's consent.

　　They asked the district office for instructions, and the opinions in the district office were also inconsistent. District Chief Cheng Haoming stubbornly stuck to dogma and supported Ren Changyou, while District Party Secretary Zhao Shijie had a strong mass perspective and sympathized with Gao Shengliang. After two months of debate, Zhao Shijie finally advocated letting Gao Shengliang try his plan for a year. Ren Changyou was dissatisfied with this decision and took a leave of absence in a fit of pique. His daughter, Guihua, was originally engaged to Gao Shengliang's child, Shuan'er, but he forced Guihua to break off the engagement with Shuan'er as revenge against Gao Shengliang.

　　After Gao Shengliang was allowed to try, he developed rapidly. At first, the masses asked for a medical department because they had no treatment for their illnesses, so Gao Shengliang started with this, gained the support of the masses, and expanded a lot of shares. Later, he expanded the cooperative several times through things like guaranteeing the payment of national salvation bonds and transporting salt.

　　However, Gao Shengliang's experiment was not entirely smooth: Ren Changyou's gang (a purchasing and storage director, a village head, and a village secretary) constantly looked for opportunities to make trouble with him. The witch doctor Hao Si'er, because the cooperative had medicine, which affected his business of pretending to be a ghost, united with a group of witch doctors to spread rumors to more backward people, incite withdrawals of shares, and fabricate ghosts and gods, causing unrest in the village. Although District Chief Cheng Haoming was an upright person, because of ideological deviations, he unwittingly listened to the words of bad elements and gave Gao Shengliang some unwarranted criticisms. In addition, Ren Changyou married his daughter to the witch doctor Hao Si'er, and Gao Shengliang's child could not sever the old relationship with her, so Hao Si'er seized on this handle and threatened him to join the ghost-making group and play tricks on his father from within. In this way, attacked from inside and outside, Gao Shengliang was made ill, and almost died at the hands of Hao Si'er. However, Gao Shengliang was very militant. Although he was mentally and physically exhausted, he finally won, defeated all the reactionary forces, and opened up a new road for the cooperative.

　　This is the simple outline of the story. The detailed situation can only be known by reading the original book, because the whole book is 160,000 words, which cannot be completely covered in a few words.

　　Subjectivism and bureaucracy were opposed everywhere in the Liberated Areas in 1944 and 1945, but as far as I know, no work has exposed them as thoroughly as this book. Cheng Haoming, the district chief in the book, is a genuine subjectivist and bureaucrat. He has two major characteristics: first, he doesn't want the situation – not only does he not investigate and research, but he also doesn't want the ready-made materials that others provide him. He only deals with problems with his set of ready-made formulas, and this set of ready-made formulas is not even narrow-minded empiricism. I don’t know if it was memorized from some book or heard from somewhere. Second, he doesn't want creativity – he believes that anything that is not in his mind is unacceptable.

　　If there are people selling something above, there will be people buying something below. With Cheng Haoming, Ren Changyou's gang could sell dogma and oppress Gao Shengliang, and Hao Si'er's gang could fabricate facts and destroy as much as possible. Precisely because he doesn't want the situation and hasn't developed the habit of analyzing the situation, any false situation comes along, which others can see clearly, but he can still believe it. For example, the wife of the village head's younger brother, Luo Zhiwang, had a dead fetus in her womb. The cooperative's doctor gave her medicine, but her body had not yet recovered, so Luo Zhiwang asked the witch doctor Hao Si'er to treat her. Hao Si'er beat her to death with a willow whip. The village head reported to Cheng Haoming that the cooperative should be responsible. Although Cheng Haoming criticized the village head for being superstitious, he also asked Gao Shengliang to criticize the cooperative's doctor. Another example is the witch doctors Bai Conghai and Yang Hanzhu, who combined with seven or eight troublemakers to deliberately make trouble at the cooperative's counter and dismantle the cooperative. The village head Luo Shengwang gave the following speech:

　　"..." The village has not investigated and researched this matter, so it is not easy to express opinions. However, since the 'common people' have 'voices,' the cooperative should consider it carefully. The 'common people' have opinions on the cooperative, and the village government and the district government all know about it... 'Should' the 'common people' have opinions on the cooperative? I think they should... 'The common people' should put forward their own demands..."

　　This kind of intentional support for bad elements to fight officialdom with Gao Shengliang has developed from being deliberately angry to deliberately destroying. However, when it later reached the district, Cheng Haoming used the following words to push the matter away. He said:

　　".... It is good that you can offer opinions to the cooperative. Renjiagou Cooperative is a privately run cooperative. If you put forward your opinions, the cooperative will naturally solve them according to your opinions...!"

　　Although these words are more peaceful than what the village head said, they are still peaceful official jargon that doesn't solve the problem, and they are still beneficial to the seven or eight people including the witch doctor Bai Conghai. Therefore, those seven or eight people all went away laughing victoriously.

　　Cheng Haoming subjectively thought that these things were listening to the opinions of the masses, but he had never heard the real opinions of the vast majority of the masses. Gao Shengliang, in front of him, can be said to be a sea of mass opinion in the Renjiagou area, but Cheng Haoming insisted on using the two plasters of subjectivism and bureaucracy to cover his eyes, sincerely and sincerely acting as a blind man.

　　People with a little creativity, when they encounter leaders like Cheng Haoming, can be suffocated to death unless there are other good conditions. If Gao Shengliang hadn't been particularly militant, he would have been killed in this siege long ago because he was able to grasp the whole situation and was enthusiastic about serving the people.

　　Subjectivism and bureaucracy have been opposed for several years, but it can only be said that there are fewer than in the past, but they have not been completely eliminated. In the current large-scale production (including agricultural production), we still encounter work that only has patterns and figures, and has not deeply studied its actual effect. I am afraid that this is also the fault of Cheng Haoming and Ren Changyou's way of thinking. I feel that everyone should read this book to avoid taking the detour of Renjiagou.

　　Anti-subjectivism and anti-bureaucracy are the central themes of this book. In addition, two other issues are raised, one is the understanding of the New Democratic economy, and the other is the importance of anti-feudal superstition. Both of these issues are reasonably resolved in this book. Although some landlords in the style of regimental leaders (leaders of local armed forces) also contributed shares to the cooperative, they could not play any manipulative role. The cooperative was still for the masses.

　　Regarding the content of this book, because I read it hastily, I can only express this point of view. After everyone reads the original book, they will definitely have more discoveries.

　　In terms of writing style, I particularly admire the author's ability to depict reality. For example, when writing about Cheng Haoming, on the one hand, he writes that he is a subjectivist and bureaucrat, and on the other hand, he writes that he is sincerely and sincerely working for the revolution. Similarly, when writing about Gao Shengliang, on the one hand, he writes that he uses all his energy to serve the people, and on the other hand, he writes about his pragmatism and superstition. He often expresses the strengths and weaknesses of these two people in the same event, making people feel that it doesn't seem like a real person without one aspect, and that both of them are well-intentioned but have ruined things a little. Only in this way is it not fabricated, and only in this way does it make people feel the importance of transforming themselves. As for the completeness of the structure, the meticulousness of the description, the beauty of the writing, etc., can only be enjoyed by reading the original book, so I will not introduce them much.

　　介绍一本好小说
    ——“高乾大”
    欧阳山著华北新华书店出版  赵树理
    “高乾大”是欧阳山同志在一九四六年写的一本反主观主义和官僚主义的小说。书中的故事是这样：——
    一九三六年，任家沟村开了个合作社，因为主任任常有不懂群众需要，办了五年，不止没有发展，还弄得亏了本。他每年依靠区上的行政命令，强向群众摊派股金，遭到无数群众的反对。副主任高生亮（就是高乾大），是个挑货郎担子游乡的，了解合作社与群众的矛盾，一心要改变一下任常有的主张，得不到任常有的同意。
    他们请示区公所，区公所的意见也不一致——区长程浩明死啃教条，支持任常有，区委书记赵士杰群众观念很强，同情高生亮，争论了两个月，最后赵士杰主张让高生亮照他的计划试办一年。任常有不满意这个决定，赌气请假休养。他的女儿桂花原和高生亮的孩子拴儿订过婚，他强迫桂花和拴儿解除婚约，作为对高生亮的报复。
    高生亮得到试办的允许后，发展得很快。开头群众因为有病没有治，要求开个医药部，高生亮就从这件事上着手，得到群众拥护，扩充了好多股金。以后又从包缴救国公债、运盐等事情上，把个合作社扩大了好几倍。
    不过高生亮的试验也不完全顺利：任常有的一把子（一个采买兼保管主任、一个乡长和一个乡书记）时时和他找空子闹气。巫神郝四儿，因为合作社有了医药，影响了他装神弄鬼的生意，他便和一伙巫神们联合起来，向落后一点的人们散出谣言，鼓动退股，并且假造鬼神，闹得一村不安。区长程浩明虽是个正派人，因为思想上有偏差，无形中听信了坏分子的话，给高生亮一些冤枉批评。再加上任常有把他女儿嫁给巫神郝四儿，高生亮的孩子与她割不断旧关系，被郝四儿抓住把柄，威胁着他参加弄鬼集团，从内部捉弄他父亲。就这样内外上下夹攻，把个高生亮捉弄病了，最后又差一点死在郝四儿手。不过高生亮斗争性很强，虽然在精神上、肉体上都斗得精疲力竭，后来总算得到胜利，把反动力量都打垮，给合作社开出一条新道路。
    这故事的简单轮廓就是这样，详细情形，只有读了原书才能知道，因为全书十六万字，绝不是几句话能包括完了的。
    主观主义、官僚主义，在一九四四年至四五年，虽在解放区到处遭到反对，可是据我所见，还没有任何一个作品能象本书揭发得那样彻底。书中的区长程浩明，便是个正牌子主观主义兼官僚主义者。他有两大特点：第一是不要情况——不只不调查研究，别人供给他现成材料他也不要，他只凭他一套现成公式处理问题，而这一套现成公式就连狭隘的经验主义也不是，不知是从哪本书上记来的还是从哪里听来的。第二是不要创造性——他认为凡是他脑子里没有的，就都是要不得的。
    上边有买什么的，下边就有卖什么的。有了程浩明，任常有的一把子人就可以发卖教条，压迫高生亮，郝四儿的一把子人也可以捏造事实尽量破坏。正因为他不要情况，没有养成分析情况的习惯，任何假情况来了，在别人看得清清楚楚，在他就还能信以为真。如乡长弟弟罗志旺的老婆，胎儿死在肚里，合作社的医生给他用药打了，身体还没有复原，罗志旺又请巫神郝四儿给她医治，郝四儿用柳条鞭子活活把她打死，乡长报告了程浩明，说是合作社应该负责，程浩明一方面虽然批评乡长不该迷信，另一方面还要叫高生亮批评合作社的医生。又如巫神白从海、杨汉珠，结合了七、八个捣乱分子到合作社柜上故意闹气，拆合作社的台，乡长罗生旺却发表了这样一段演说：
    “……”这回事情，乡上没有调查研究，不好表示意见。不过既然‘老百姓’有了‘呼声’，合作社就该好好考虑。‘老百姓’对合作社有意见，乡政府和区政府都是知道的……‘老百姓’应不应该对合作社有意见，我想是应该的……‘老百姓’应该提出自己的要求………”
    这样有意支持着坏分子和高生亮打官腔，已经是由闹意气发展到故意破坏的程度了，可是后来闹到区上，程浩明又用以下的话把事情推开。他说：
    “………你们能够对合作社提意见是好的。任家沟合作社是民办合作社，你们提出意见来，合作社自然会依照你们的意见解决……！”
    这话虽然比乡长说得和平一点，可仍是不解决问题的和平官腔，仍是有利于巫神白从海等七、八个人的，因此那七、八个人都胜利地欢笑而去。
    这些事，在程浩明主观上还以为是听取群众意见，而真正的大多数群众意见他没听见过。在他眼前的高生亮，可以说是任家沟一带群众意见的大海，可是程浩明偏要用主观主义和官僚主义两贴膏药把自己的眼睛贴起来，诚心诚意当瞎子。
    有点创造性的人们，一碰到程浩明一类人的领导之下，如无其他好条件，管保可以闷死。象高生亮这样能掌握全部情况热心为人民服务的人，要不是斗争性特别强，早在这夹攻中被害死了。
    主观主义和官僚主义曾经大家反对了好几年，可是只能说比过去少了些，却并没有彻底肃清。在目前的大生产中（连农业生产在内），尚遇到只有花样和数字的工作，并未深入研究其实效，这恐怕也是程浩明、任常有式的思想方法作怪，我觉着大家都读一读本书，可以避免走任家沟的弯路。
    反主观主义和官僚主义是本书的中心主题。此外还附带提出了两个问题，一个是对新民主主义经济的了解问题，一个是对反封建迷信的重视问题。这两个问题在本书中都得到合理的解决。虽然有团总式的（地主武装领导人）财主也给合作社入了点股，但他们并不能起到什么操纵作用，合作社还是群众的。
    关于本书的内容，我因为读得粗疏，只能发表这点观感。大家读了原书之后，一定会有更多的发现。
    在写法上，我特别赞成作者描写现实的本领。象写程浩明，一方面写出他是主观主义和官僚主义者，另一方面又写出他主观上是诚心诚意在那里为革命。同样，写高生亮，一方面写出他用全副精力为人民服务，另一方面又写出他的事务主义和迷信。他把这两个人的特长和特短，常常表现在同样事件中，使人感觉到缺了那一方面也不象个真人，两个人都是好心好意但却都坏了点事。只有这样才不是伪造，也只有这样才使人感到改造自己之重要性。至于结构的完整、描摹的细致、行文的优美等，也只有读了原书才能享受到，我也就不多作介绍了。
