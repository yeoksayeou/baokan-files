[Beiyue News] The Wutai Joint District Transportation Cooperative was established in the spring of 1947. At that time, the people of Wutai County were tasked with transporting coal for the Ministry of Industry, which placed an excessive burden on their labor, especially during the spring plowing season. Given the need to complete the transportation task while also ensuring the cultivation of the people's land, a specialized store and a joint district transportation cooperative were established, raising a total of 12 million yuan in shares. After more than a year of operation, the cooperative not only reduced the labor burden on the people of the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and 10th districts, but also allowed the people to share in the dividends and helped them solve various difficulties in production. Therefore, the cooperative has won the support of the broad masses.

After its establishment, in addition to completing the transportation tasks of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the transportation cooperative also integrated with the production of the masses and supplied the daily necessities of the people of Wutai County. The tenth district of the county produces many pears, but they could not be sold. The transportation cooperative immediately helped the people of the tenth district transport pears to other districts and, on the return trip, transported back the people's daily necessities. For example, it transported back 30,000 jin of sea salt from the Jin-Sui District, solving the difficulty of the people of Wutai County in buying salt. This spring, the transportation cooperative also helped the people of Daixian County and solved the problem of 20 shi of corn seeds. At the same time, it provided sowing services to military dependents and farmers with little or no labor in various districts, using a total of 550 labor (animal power) days, and also helped transport supplies for passing troops, contributing more than 1,000 labor (animal power) days.

In order to ensure that the carriers had loads to carry on their return trips, the transportation cooperative also negotiated with the Jin-Sui Office to establish a transfer station in Doucun, which increased the income of the carriers. It transported more than 350,000 jin of homespun cloth and cotton to Daixian County. In addition to completing the transportation tasks of Jin-Sui and the Ministry of Industry, it made a profit of more than 21 million yuan. It transported 30,000 jin of rails, making a profit of 1.2 million yuan.

The transportation cooperative also has a veterinary station, which, in addition to treating the 40 livestock within the cooperative, has also treated 610 livestock for the masses in half a year, selling a total of 150 jin of medicine and making a profit of 396,000 yuan.

When the cooperative was first established, the masses said, "It's not bad to replace corvée labor." After the two dividend distributions in March and June this year, totaling 33.56 million yuan, the masses felt that the transportation cooperative was truly working for their benefit. During the first dividend distribution, the masses requested to receive goods in kind. Based on the needs of the masses, it was decided that, for example, the people in the urban area requested homespun cloth, and the transportation cooperative used the dividends allocated to the urban area to buy cloth and distribute it to them. The transportation cooperative also used the dividends it received to help various districts organize service cooperatives. The service cooperative in the urban area is dedicated to providing services for urgent and short-term labor needs, saving more than 220 labor days per month. In June, the people in the urban area received 1.8 million yuan in dividends, which were all invested in the service cooperative to expand its operations and further reduce the labor burden on the masses. Other districts are also preparing to establish service cooperatives.

　　处处为着群众需要
    五台运输社深受群众拥护
    【北岳讯】五台联区运输社，是在一九四七年春天建立起来的，当时五台县群众负有给工业部运煤的任务，使群众劳力负担过重，特别又是春耕时期，在这运输任务要完成，而群众土地又要耕种的情形下，于是有专办商店，联区建立了运输社，共集股金一千二百万元；经过一年多的经营，运输社不仅减轻了三、四、六、七、九、十等区群众的劳力负担，而且使群众分得红利，帮助群众解决生产中的各种困难。因此，该社荣获广大群众的拥护。
    运输社成立后，除去完成工商部的运输任务，还和群众的生产结合起来，并供给了五台县群众的日常必需品。该县十区产梨很多，就是推销不出去，运输社即帮助十区群众向外区运梨，回来时又运回群众的日用品。如一次在晋绥区运回海盐三万斤，解决了五台县群众买不到盐的困难，今年春天运输社又帮助代县群众，解决了二十石玉茭种子。同时给各区贫苦无劳力的军属农民进行播种，共用工（畜力）五百五十个，并帮助过往部队运输，支差一千余个工（畜力）。
    为了使运夫往返都有脚驮，运输社又和晋绥办事处交涉，在豆村建立了一个转运站，这样使运夫增加更多的收入。共运至代县土布、棉花三十五万余斤，除完成了晋绥和工业部的运输任务外，获利二千一百余万元，运铁轨三万斤，获利一百二十万元。
    运输社内部还设一兽医所，除去医治运输社内的四十头牲口，在半年的时间，还给群众医好牲口六百一十头，共卖药一百五十斤，获利三十九万六千元。
    该社在初成立时，群众都说：“顶了差就不坏。”经过今年三月及六月两次分红三千三百五十六万元，群众都感到运输社真正为自己谋了利益。第一次分红时，群众都要求分实物，根据群众需要决定，如城区群众要求土布，运输社用城区应分的红利买成布分给他们。运输社又以分到的红利，帮助各区组织勤务社。城区勤务社，专供给急差短差之用，每月即省工二百二十余个；在六月份城区群众分得的红利一百八十万元，全部投入勤务社，扩大勤务社的经营，以更多的减轻群众的劳力负担，其他区也准备建立。
