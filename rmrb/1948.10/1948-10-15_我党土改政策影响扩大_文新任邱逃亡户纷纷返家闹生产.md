[Jizhong Telegram] People from all walks of life in Wenxin and Renqiu who fled to the Kuomintang areas are returning home to participate in production under the influence of our land reform and production relief policies. According to statistics from 99 villages in seven districts from late August to early September (20 days), 127 poor peasant households, 89 middle peasant households, 10 rich peasant households, and 9 landlord households, totaling 235 households with 772 people, have returned home to engage in production. Among them, there are also 16 households with 35 family members of Kuomintang soldiers. Most of these fugitive households, except for landlords and rich peasants who fled for fear of struggle, fled to make a living due to the severe enemy disasters and floods after the incident. Because prices in the Kuomintang areas are soaring, and recently the "currency reform" has been implemented, with forced conscription everywhere, making it impossible for people to live. In addition, their homes are all in the liberated areas, and the democratic government supports people's production, encourages productive labor, and leaves them a piece of land in the land reform. Under these two completely different circumstances, they have returned to the liberated areas one after another. After returning home, they have been cared for by the democratic government and their fellow villagers. After the landlord Gong Shangming returned to Gongkouhou Village, the village immediately gave him houses and land to settle him. After the middle peasant Liu Yonggang returned to Fugezhuang, the village immediately gave him three dou of corn to solve his immediate food needs. The middle peasant Nian Guoqing in Hancun had his property well preserved by the village during the land reform, and it was immediately returned to him after he returned home. Liu Ertu from Qianhuangzi Village, whose family of three had fled famine for ten years, recently returned from Changchun, and the village immediately gave him the piece of land reserved for him during the land reform, and gave him three houses, and the masses voluntarily lent him furniture such as pots, bowls, and basins. Kuomintang military personnel and their families who returned to the villages were also given the same help. In order to better resettle these returning people from all walks of life, the Wenxin County Party Committee specifically instructed all districts that regardless of which class of people returned, if they had financial difficulties at the time, they could temporarily rely on relatives and friends, or the villagers could solve the problem through mutual assistance; and educate them to cut grass and vegetables, and organize them to cooperate in production; the government would provide relief to the elderly and weak who could not work; and the government would provide loans to support those who had labor but no production capital. For those who left a piece of land during the land reform, the land can be given to the individual, and for those who did not leave land, a share can be allocated from the land in the village that has not been distributed. In addition, it was proposed that whether they are landlords, rich peasants, or family members of Kuomintang soldiers, as long as they abide by government laws and engage in production after returning home, the government will protect and help them.

　　我党土改政策影响扩大
    文新任邱逃亡户纷纷返家闹生产
    【冀中电】文新、任邱逃亡在国民党区的各阶层人民，在我土改与生产救灾政策影响下，纷纷回家参加生产。从八月下旬到九月上旬廿天中，据七个区九十九个村统计，即有贫农一百廿七户、中农八十九户、富农十户、地主九户，共二百三十五户，七百七十二人回家生产。其中并有国民党军家属十六户，三十五人。这些逃亡户，除地主富农是怕斗争而逃亡外，大部分是事变后因敌灾、水灾严重而逃亡在外谋生的。因为国民党区物价飞涨，又加上最近实行“币制改革”，到处强抓壮丁，使人民无法生活。另外他们的家都在解放区里，民主政府扶植人民生产，奖励生产劳动，土改中又给他们留下了一份土地。在这两种截然不同的情况下，便纷纷返回解放区。他们回家后，都受到民主政府和本村乡亲们的关怀。巩寇后村地主巩尚明回家后，村里立时给他房子、土地安置了他。富各庄中农刘永刚回家后，村里马上给了他三斗棒子，解决眼下吃的。韩村中农年国清，土改中村里很好的保管了他的财产，回家后马上归还了他。前磺子村刘二秃全家三口逃荒十年，最近由长春回来，村里立时将土改中给他留的一份土地给了他，又给他三间房子，群众自动借给他锅碗盆等家具。各村回来的国民党军人员及其家属，也同样予以帮助。文新县委为了更好的安置这些回家的各阶层人民，特指示各区无论那个阶层的人民回来后，如当时生活困难，可暂时投靠亲友，或由本村群众互助解决；并教育他们打草、打菜，组织他们合作生产；对老弱不能劳动的，政府予以赈济；对有劳动力无生产资本的，政府贷款扶助。对土改中留下一份土地者，可将土地给予本人，对未留下土地者，可从村中未分完的土地中分给其一份。另外提出，无论是地主、富农或国民党军家属，回家后只要遵守政府法令，并从事生产，政府都予以保护和帮助。
