　　Xinxiang Armed Autumn Protection Experience
    [Taihang Telegram] The Xinxiang armed protection of the autumn harvest movement was successfully completed at the end of September, and is now actively protecting the planting of wheat and storing of grain. The following four important experiences were gained in this autumn protection movement: (1) Rectify the backbone force for autumn protection and improve leadership at all levels. First, short-term training classes for district and village cadres and militia were held, mainly to clarify confused ideas about policies and current affairs, and to widely discuss the autumn protection deployment; second, the county and the leading organs of the joint defense, and the village cadres were divided into front and rear areas, with division of labor and responsibilities. In addition, a large-scale armed review meeting was held throughout the county to explain the situation and hold combat technical exercises. Twenty-three heroes and shooters who killed the enemy were rewarded, which inspired everyone's will to fight for autumn protection. (2) Combine military and political efforts, go deep behind enemy lines, correctly implement the policy of leniency, and open up new battlefields on the border. Small armed forces in the ×× districts extended to the enemy's rear to capture enemy plainclothes armed forces that were demanding grain and money sporadically, and mass rallies were held to publicize victories, expose enemy rumors, and encourage fighting spirit. A meeting of puppet families was held to publicize our lenient policy, inspire accusations against Chiang Kai-shek's crime of conscripting soldiers, and mobilize people to demand the return of their sons and husbands, and the captured enemy's scattered armed forces were educated and released. This had a great impact, and won praise from the masses behind enemy lines, shook the Kuomintang bandit army, and used various opportunities to educate the puppet village chiefs, warning them to do something good for the masses and strive to help with the struggle against grain and conscription. In this way, the foundation of the new battlefield was initially established. Mobilize and arm the masses to establish joint defense, organize guerrilla groups, coordinate activities, and help them gradually consolidate and develop. After establishing close contact with the masses behind enemy lines, it became easier to effectively grasp intelligence, which greatly facilitated our border armed forces to penetrate into the Kuomintang-controlled areas to attack the enemy. (3) Promote the two main fighting methods of mine warfare and joint defense struggle, and launch a mass-based autumn protection guerrilla war. Its main characteristic is that the self-defense forces support the militia in armed resistance against the enemy. In the past, the work of the self-defense forces was generally neglected, which led to the separation of guerrilla warfare from the masses. This autumn, × village enlightened the masses from their own vital interests, making them realize that without arms and unity, they could not defeat the enemy. The masses spontaneously organized self-defense forces to cooperate with the militia in activities such as laying mines, which gained great training and improvement. They are now actively buying saltpeter and preparing to make gunpowder to use all the earthen guns and cannons to attack the enemy. In the joint defense struggle, in addition to close contact and mutual support with neighboring counties, districts, and villages, in response to the new tricks of small-scale enemy sneak attacks, each joint defense further organized mobile armed forces to provide support at any time. In launching mine warfare, a meeting of militia and self-defense forces was first held to discuss explosions, check past shortcomings, teach and learn from each other, and conduct practical exercises to learn more than a dozen kinds of laying methods. The county leadership also went deep into the inspection and found that some buried mines did not explode because of four problems: shallow pits, light stones, unsmooth fuse, and damp mines. They promptly proposed corrections, which took effect immediately and improved and consolidated everyone's confidence in laying mines. Some places created methods of burying mines that were both real and fake to deceive the enemy. (4) Combine labor and military affairs. Truly establish on the basis of common interests in autumn protection, so that labor and military forces consciously guarantee each other and complete their respective tasks. During the day, the militia is active in the front to guard against the enemy, and behind them, with the self-defense forces as the backbone, combined with the masses of the whole village, they rush to harvest, and help the militia harvest. The whole county implemented a work ticket system, stipulating that militia participating in combat, standing guard, and self-defense, etc., should be given harvesting for the militia, all of which should be used as work points, and finally the whole village should settle accounts uniformly, with labor averaging the burden of work, with long-term workers earning more and short-term workers contributing more.

　　新乡武装保秋经验
    【太行电】新乡武装保卫抢收运动，已于九月底胜利完成，现正积极保卫种麦藏粮。这一段的保秋运动获得以下四点重要经验：（一）整顿保秋骨干力量，健全各级领导。首先开办区村干部民兵短期训练班，主要是澄清对于政策与时事上存在的糊涂思想，广泛讨论了保秋布署；其次，县及各联防领导机关、各村干部分别组成前后方，分工负责。另外全县召开大规模的武装检阅大会，讲解形势，举行战斗技术演习，二十三名杀敌英雄与射手受到奖励，鼓舞了大家保秋斗争的意志。（二）军政结合，深入敌后，正确执行宽大政策，开辟边沿斗争新阵地。××两区小型武装伸至敌后捕捉敌催要粮款零散的便衣武装，普遍召开群众大会，宣传胜利，揭发敌人谣言，鼓舞斗争情绪，召开伪属会，宣传我宽大政策，启发控诉蒋匪抓丁罪行，动员叫子索夫，并将捕捉敌之零散武装教育释放。这样影响甚大，获得敌后广大群众赞扬，动摇了国民党匪军，对各村伪保长，经常利用各种机会进行教育，警告他们给群众办点好事，争取他们帮助进行抗粮抗丁斗争。这样，初步确立新阵地基础。发动与武装群众建立联防，组织游击小组，协同活动，扶助其逐渐巩固发展。与敌后群众建立了密切联系后，更容易切实掌握情报，大大便利我边地武装深入国民党统治区打击敌人。（三）发扬地雷战与联防斗争两个主要斗争方式，开展群众性的保秋游击战争。其主要特点是自卫队支援民兵武装抗敌。过去普遍的忽视自卫队工作，致使游击战脱离群众。×村今秋从群众切身利益启发其觉悟，认识了没有武装与不团结一致就不能战胜敌人，群众自动组织了自卫队，协同民兵活动，埋地雷，获得很大锻炼与提高。现正积极买火硝，准备造火药，将所有土枪土炮使用起来，打击敌人。在联防斗争中，除与友邻县、区联防、村密切联系互相支援外，针对敌人小股偷袭的新花样，各联防进一步组织了机动武装，随时支援。在发动地雷战中，先召开民兵自卫队爆炸会议，检查过去缺点，互教互学，实际演习，学会十几种埋法。县领导上又深入检查，发现有的埋雷不响，原因是坑浅、石轻、火线不顺、雷潮湿等四个毛病，及时提出改正，马上生效，并提高与巩固了大家的埋雷信心。有的地方创造埋雷有真有假，欺骗敌人的办法。（四）劳武结合。真正建立在共同保秋利益的基础上，致使劳力与武力相互自觉保证，完成各自的任务。白天民兵在前边活动警戒敌人，后边以自卫队为骨干，结合全村群众突击抢收，并帮助民兵收割。全县都实行了工票制，规定民兵参战站岗自卫，等给民兵收割，均一样顶工，最后全村统一算帐，以劳力平均负担勤工，长工得，短工出。
