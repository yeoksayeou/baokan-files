The North Yue Fourth District Committee Decides After Inspection:
  　Seriously Write Work Reports
    [This Newspaper's News] The North Yue Fourth District Committee held a meeting on the 7th of this month to conduct an inspection regarding the implementation of the reporting system to higher authorities. Since the land conference last year, very few reports have been made to higher authorities, the reporting system has not been strictly implemented, or only sporadic materials from typical cases in various counties have been forwarded. The summary of land reform and party rectification for the entire sub-district has only been drafted so far and has not yet been finalized and approved. At the very beginning of the land reform, the Central Bureau asked us to report frequently to provide information, but we failed to implement this.
    Not only were the number of reports few, but the content also had many defects. Some reports had very incomplete materials and were empty in content. Most reports were not carefully analyzed and synthesized, and lacked deep consideration; some were discussed, some were written by individual committee members without thorough research by the committee; some were individual committee members who put forward some opinions, which were written by the research office and then hastily sent out; some were just a simple collection of materials sent as they were, unable to raise issues of principle, thus making it difficult for the higher authorities to understand the full picture of our work from our reports, or to discover important key issues and give timely instructions. We have not made comprehensive reports, carefully considered and summarized the overall work, thereby discovering key issues in the work to improve and strengthen leadership or revise inappropriate parts of the work plan. In addition, there is also a phenomenon of asking for instructions more and reflecting work situations less.
    On some major and principled issues, there were violations of discipline such as not asking for instructions beforehand and not reporting afterwards (such as the determination of certain specific policy issues in the distribution of land in various counties), reporting while conveying (such as the "Opinions on Implementing the Central Bureau's Draft on Dealing with Floating Property" which was sent to various counties for reference and reported to the district party committee at the same time), and reporting after implementation (such as the transfer of many county committee members; in addition, although the appointment of some county committee members was stated to be temporarily unannounced, in practice it was often equivalent to announcing it).
    The meeting reviewed the reasons for the above situations: First, there was insufficient understanding of the importance of making reports. We did not realize that not reporting to higher authorities is a violation of discipline and an act of independence from above. We did not sufficiently realize that making reports is a necessary condition for higher authorities to understand the situation and guide our work in a timely manner. We did not regard reporting to higher authorities as an important opportunity for us to consider the overall work comprehensively, summarize experience, and thereby improve our work. Therefore, passive coping (reporting only when urged, not thinking deeply, and sending out reports hastily, etc.), laziness, and procrastination (excusing ourselves with being busy with work, waiting for materials from below, and being too lazy to write) and other bad work styles arose.
    Second, there is still a large degree of guerrilla habits, accustomed to waiting until a task is completed before making a summary report, and only having a comprehensive summary report at the end of each year. Thinking that talking face-to-face or reporting on the phone can replace written reports; feeling that reporting one thing at a time and sending one material at a time can eliminate the need to write comprehensive reports; some believe that since various departments have already reported, there is no need to make a comprehensive report.
    Third, bureaucratic work styles and handicraft-style leadership, lacking in-depth work and poor grasp of the overall situation, are also a reason for the reduction in reports.
    Fourth, a major reason why there are few comprehensive reports or poor comprehensive reports is that we are poor at learning and have a low level of theory, and therefore cannot synthesize, analyze, or raise issues to the level of principle.
    Based on the review, it was decided: In the future, we will guarantee to report to higher authorities as required, and the content of the reports must be carefully considered and jointly researched.

### 北岳四地委检查后决定　认真写好工作报告

　　北岳四地委检查后决定
  　认真写好工作报告
    【本报讯】北岳四地委于本月七日集会，进行关于执行对上级报告制度的检查。自去年土地会议以来，向上级作的报告很少，未严格执行报告制度，或仅有各县典型材料零星材料的转送。全分区的土改整党总结，则至今仅写就草稿，还未最后研究审定。在土改一开始，中央局要我们经常作报告供给情况，我们却未能执行。
    报告的次数既少，内容也有很多缺陷，有的报告，材料很不完全，内容空洞，大部报告，未经慎重的分析综合，缺乏深思熟虑；有的经过讨论，有的是个别委员写了未经委员会很好研究；有的是个别委员提出一些意见，由研究室写出后就草率发出；有的则只是简单的汇集了材料原盘送上，不能提出原则性的问题，因之，使得上级很难从我们的报告中了解到工作的全貌，或发现重要的关键问题给以及时的指示。我们更未作综合报告，用心考虑与总结全盘工作，从而发现工作中的关键问题，以改进与加强领导或修正工作计划中的不妥部分。此外，还有请示问题多，反映工作情况少的现象。
    在有些重大的、原则性的问题上，曾有过事先不请示事后不报告（如各县分地中某些具体政策问题的确定），一面传达一面上报（如“关于执行中央局处理浮财草案的意见”就是同时发各县参考并报区党委的），先执行后报告（如许多县委委员的调走；另有一些县委委员的委派虽说明暂不宣布职位，但实际则往往等于宣布了）等违犯纪律的行为。
    会议检讨产生以上情形的原因：一、对作报告的重要性认识不足，没有认识到不向上级作报告就是违犯纪律对上闹独立性的行为；没有足够认识到作报告是使上级了解情况及时指导我们工作的必备条件；没有把向上级报告作为我们本身考虑全面工作，总结经验，借以改进工作的重要机会。因而就产生了被动应付（催促才报，不深思熟虑，草率送出就算等等），懒怠拖延（借口工作忙，借口等下面材料，懒得动笔写）等恶劣作风。
    二、还残存着很大程度的游击习气，习惯于等一个工作完了再做总结性的报告，每年年终才有一个全面总结报告。以为当面谈了或电话上报告了就可以代替了书面报告；觉得有一件事谈一件事，有一个材料送一个材料就可以不再写综合性的报告；有的认为各部门已有报告，不须再作综合报告。
    三、官僚主义作风与手工业的领导方式，工作不深入，掌握全面情况差，也是使报告减少的一个原因。
    四、综合报告少或综合得不好，还有一个主要原因是我们学习差，理论水平低，因而综合不起来，不会分析、提不到原则的高度。
    根据检讨决定：今后保证按规定向上级作报告，报告内容要是经过深思熟虑共同研究的。
