　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: How to implement production policies in autumn harvest, grain requisition, land certificate issuance, and other work, and how to get through the masses' thinking is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in various places. In response to this problem, the Northeast Daily recently published a short commentary entitled "Conscientiously Implement Production Policies," pointing out that some comrades in the work of publicizing and explaining production policies, and in specific practices, often have inappropriate or even policy-violating practices. For example, some places one-sidedly interpret the assessment of land grades as facilitating the delivery of public grain, without focusing on publicizing the positive significance of land assessment and certificate issuance in determining land rights and encouraging production. Some places cater to the fear of burden among some of the masses, only talking about how light the public grain is this year, without carefully explaining the burden policy and the principle of supporting the front. Some places, in mobilizing the masses to protect seedlings and oppose waste, and in organizing sideline production for famine preparedness, are eager for quick results, resorting to unscrupulous means, forced orders, and impatience in publicizing hard work and prosperity. Some places regard the principle of voluntary mutual benefit in organizing mass production as only empty slogans for publicity, and practice coercion when doing it, or openly permit voluntarism but actually force it. They use the excuse that it is impossible to lead or control without doing so. The short commentary requires cadres at all levels to carefully study the relevant production documents promulgated by the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau in light of their own work, and to truly implement the Party's policies among the masses in order to complete the autumn harvest, thoroughly eliminate the masses' concerns, and smoothly carry out next year's large-scale production.

　　东北号召贯彻生产政策
  　把文件对照自己工作认真研究正确贯彻党的政策到群众中去
    【新华社东北二十五日电】如何在秋收、征粮、发土地证等工作中贯彻生产政策，打通群众思想，这是目前各地亟待解决的问题。针对这个问题，东北日报顷以“认真贯彻生产政策”为题发表短评，指出还有一些工作同志在生产政策的宣传解释上，在具体作法上，往往有不妥当甚至违反政策之处。如有些地方把评土地等级片面的解释为便于交公粮，不着重宣传评地发照在确定地权鼓励生产方面的积极意义。有些地方迎合部分群众怕负担心理，光说今年公粮如何如何轻，而不仔细解释负担政策及支援前线的道理。有些地方在动员群众护青、反对浪费上，在组织副业生产备荒上，急于求成，不择手段，强迫命令，不耐心宣传勤劳发家。有些地方把组织群众生产的自愿两利原则只当空洞口号来宣传，做的时候就实行强迫，或明许自愿、实际强迫。借口不这样就无法领导，无法掌握。该短评要求各级干部在工作中将中央、东北局颁布的有关生产的文件对照自己的工作认真地加以研究，并正确地将党的政策真正贯彻到群众中去，以完成秋收，彻底消除群众顾虑，顺利开展明年大生产。
