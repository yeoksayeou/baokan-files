[Taihang Electric] On August 22, the Third District of Qixian County convened a meeting of intellectuals from all walks of life in the border region to discuss current events. Forty-eight people attended, some of whom had recently returned from cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, some were at home, and some were elementary school teachers. Because they had long been deceived by the reactionary propaganda of Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets, they did not understand the liberated areas very well. In addition, some biases in our past policy implementation made some of them feel distressed and uneasy. This time, our government warmly invited them to a forum. During the discussion of current events, everyone used their personal experiences to expose the reactionary darkness of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government. From the student movement, the victory of our liberation of Kaifeng and Luoyang, and the worthlessness of Chiang's currency, they more clearly realized the inevitable collapse of the Chiang family dynasty. They raised many questions generated under the deception of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary propaganda, such as: What is the international status of the Communist Party? Why is the Chinese people's war against American imperialist aggression and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek called a liberation war? Will the U.S. loan be repaid after Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown? And after the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, what about the various national New Democratic construction issues, etc.? The democratic government gave detailed answers to all of them, affirmatively telling everyone about the development of the Chinese Communist Party and the world people's democratic forces, the fundamental difference between socialist Soviet Union and American imperialists, and the democratic government's policies on resettlement and transformation of landlords and rich peasants for labor production after the land reform, especially the difference between intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds and landlords and rich peasants, and our party's attitude towards uniting and transforming intellectuals. After listening, everyone's thinking gradually became clear. They further asked what is feudalism? When will land reform be carried out in the border areas and how will it be carried out? After the answers, they excitedly said: "So the road is still open in all directions!" After the meeting, they generally had individual talks with our staff, and many thoughts that they did not dare to say at the meeting were revealed. Mr. Liu from × village wants to send seven students to the liberated area to study (three have already arrived in our area). Most of them requested to subscribe to a copy of the liberated area newspaper each, to become more familiar with various policies of the liberated area, and to tell the broad masses in the Kuomintang-controlled area.

　　淇县边地知识分子座谈
    了解时事和政策广泛传向蒋匪区
    【太行电】淇县三区于八月二十二日召集边地各阶层在乡知识分子会议，座谈时事。到会的四十八人，有的是新从国民党统治区城市回来，有的在家，有的担任小学教员。由于他们长期受蒋伪反动的欺骗宣传，对解放区十分不了解。加以过去我们执行政策中的某些偏向，所以有的苦闷不安。此次经我政府热情邀集座谈，在讨论时事中，大家均以切身的体验，揭露蒋匪政府的反动黑暗。由学生运动、我解放开封、洛阳的胜利、蒋币不值钱等，更清楚地认识蒋家朝廷的必然崩溃。他们提出很多在蒋匪反动宣传蒙蔽下产生的问题如：共产党在国际上的地位？中国人民反对美帝侵略及其走狗蒋介石的战争为什么叫解放战争？打倒蒋介石后是不是偿还美国贷款？以及中国人民解放战争胜利后，有关全国新民主主义各种建设问题等，民主政府均予以详尽的解答，肯定的告诉大家，中国共产党及世界人民民主力量的发展情况，社会主义的苏联和美国帝国主义者的根本区别，以及土改后民主政府安置与改造地富劳动生产的政策，特别是地富出身的知识分子和地富有什么不同，我党对知识分子团结改造的态度等。大家听后，思想逐渐明确起来。又进一步提出什么叫封建？边地什么时候进行土改和如何进行？经解答后，他们兴奋的说：“原来路还是四通八达呀！”会后，和我工作人员普遍个别晤谈，有很多会上不敢说的心思话又谈出来。×村刘先生要送七个同学来解放区上学（现有三个已到我区）。他们大部要求每人订份解放区报纸，以更多的熟悉解放区各种政策，告诉给国民党统治区广大群众。
