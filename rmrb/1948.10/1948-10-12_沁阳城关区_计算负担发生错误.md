　　Qin Yang Chengguan District
    Calculation Burden Error Occurred
    [Taihang News] In Qin Yang Chengguan District, the failure to earnestly implement the new burden method has greatly hindered the development of small businesses in the city. Small businesses in the city should have their burden calculated according to the commercial income tax, but it was mistakenly calculated as part of the agricultural burden. The residents of Qin Yang Chengguan District mainly rely on small businesses and small handicrafts, carrying goods for trade and boiling saltpeter for a living, with only a few households relying on land for their livelihood. At the beginning of the burden assessment, the county government convened a meeting of district, county, and village cadres to study the burden policy and specific methods. It was stipulated that whoever cultivates the land and harvests the income should bear the burden. The burdens of urban businesses and farmers should be calculated separately, but the street cadres did not earnestly implement the policy. Except for the larger established businesses, the income from general small handicrafts and businesses was all mistakenly calculated according to the agricultural burden method.

    For example: In the 12th Street, there is a seventy-year-old woman, living alone, who invested 4,000 yuan in a cooperative. She received 4,000 yuan in dividends in one year and was given some fruits and things during the land reform. She has no land, but she was assessed eight li according to the agricultural tax, and burdened with ten jin of wheat. In the 12th Street, a carpenter named An Zhanjin has no land at home. He is the only labor force and supports a family of three with his craft. He was also calculated according to the agricultural tax method. The burden for a family of four was a total of 8.2 fen, with each fen being 25 jin, so he had to provide 205 jin of wheat.

    In addition, the village cadres did not explain the policies, regardless of whether it was reasonable or not, fair or not, only seeking to complete the task. The 1st Street has a total of 313 households, including 80 large and small established businesses. Apart from these 80 households, the other 233 households were decided by the street cadres to be burdened on a per capita basis, and the task of 18,000 jin for the whole street was distributed equally. As a result of this burden, 18 households moved away and 14 households fled for fear of having their income assessed.

    After learning about this situation, the county and district decided to correct the burden deviation. First, they held a meeting of district, village, street cadres, and appraisers to specifically study the policies and methods. They solved the problem of street cadres and appraisers lacking policy awareness and focusing solely on completing tasks, re-established correct viewpoints, mastered policies, and served the people, so as to achieve a fair and reasonable burden. They are currently in the process of correcting the situation.

### 沁阳城关区  计算负担发生错误

　　沁阳城关区
    计算负担发生错误
    【太行讯】沁阳城关区，因没有认真的执行新负担办法，对城市的小商业发展妨害很大。城市小商本应当按商业所得税计算负担，但竟错误的计算到农业负担里。沁阳城关区居民主要依靠小商和小手工业，肩挑贸易、熬硝盐为生，只有少数户依靠土地为生活。负担开始时，县政府召开了区县干部及村干部会议，研究了负担政策与具体办法。规定土地收入谁种谁收谁出负担。城镇的商归商、农归农负担，但街干部不认真执行政策，除较大的座商外，一般小手工业，及工商收入，全部错误的按农业负担法计算。
    例如：十二街有七十岁老太太，一口人在合作社入股四千元，一年红利四千元，土改中分过果实东西，无地，给她按农业税估计了八厘，负担麦子十斤。十二街一个木匠安占金，家里无地，只有他一个劳力，靠他的手艺养活三口人。也按农业税办法，四口人计算负担共八·二分，每分二十五斤，出负担麦子二○五斤。
    此外，村干部不讲政策，不管合理不合理，公道不公道，只求完成任务。一街共三一三户，内有大小座商八十户，除此八十户外，其他二三三户由街干部决定按人头负担，全街任务一万八千斤平均分配。经过这样负担，群众因怕估计收入，移走的十八户，逃走的十四户。
    县区从了解这一情况后，决定纠正负担偏向。首先开了区村街干部及评议员会，具体研究政策办法，解决了街上干部评议员们无政策和单纯完成任务的思想，重新树立正确观点，掌握政策，为民服务，做到负担公道合理，现正进行纠正中。
