　　Enforce Party Discipline and Stabilize Order
  　Jingxing Expels Zhang Dongxi and Others from the Party
    [North Yue News] Since the beginning of spring, gambling, superstition, sabotage of transportation, theft and sale of electrical wires have occurred continuously in Jingxing, causing social disorder and unrest in the liberated areas. The occurrence of this chaotic phenomenon is mainly due to the troublemaking of ruffians, local bullies, and saboteurs. According to recent cases, some degenerate elements within the Party have also participated in their illegal activities. For example, Zhang Dongxi from Kangzhuang in the Second District, 25 years old, joined the Party in 1942, and served as a guerrilla squad leader and director of the village military committee. He consistently displayed independence and split the unity of the branch. In April, he stole the long-distance telephone line of the sub-district connecting to Jingxing twice. Gao Sichun from Xiaozuo Village in the Fourth District, 23 years old, served as a guerrilla captain for one year and a village military committee communicator for two years. He joined the Party in 1944 and consistently liked to gamble. In April, he and Wu Malang cut 17.5 jin of electric wire on the east mountain of Xiaozhai and sold it to Chunxi, a villager in their village. After being discovered by the district office, he first quibbled and denied it, but confessed the facts after the evidence was conclusive the second time. Zhao Tiansuo from Gangtou in the Fourth District, 26 years old, served as a reconnaissance agent behind enemy lines, but later went home under the pretext of being afraid of hardship and worked for the enemy. After liberation, he served as the village branch secretary. In July this year, during the Jinzhong Campaign, when his livestock were dispatched for wartime service, he not only refused to go but also gambled with hooligans and loafers. In order to enforce Party discipline and stabilize social order, the county party committee of the county decided to expel Zhang Dongxi and Gao Sichun from the Party and hand them over to the government for legal action. Zhao Tiansuo was given a demotion.

　　严肃党纪安定秩序
  　井陉开除张栋喜等党籍
    【北岳讯】入春以来，井陉不断发生赌博、闹迷信、破坏交通、盗卖电线等现象，使解放区社会秩序混乱不安。这种混乱现象的发生，主要是流氓地痞和破坏分子乘机捣乱。根据近来查获案件，还有个别党内蜕化分子参加其非法活动。如二区康庄张栋喜，现年二十五岁，四二年入党，曾担任过游击小队长，村武委会主任，一贯的好闹独立性，分裂支部团结，四月间偷割分区通井陉的长途电线两次。四区小作村高四春，现年二十三岁，曾任游击队长一年，村武委会通信员二年，四四年入党，一贯好耍钱；四月间和武麻郎在小寨东山割电线十七斤半，卖给本村村民春喜。经区公所查觉后，第一次诡辩不认，第二次因证据确凿才供出事实。四区岗头赵天锁，二十六岁，曾任敌后侦察员，后因怕吃苦借故回家，在上给敌人做工，解放后任村支部书记，今年七月间晋中战役时，派他的牲口出战勤，他不但不去，反常和流氓懒汉在一块耍钱。该县县委为严肃党内纪律，安定社会秩序，特决定将张栋喜、高四春开除党籍，送政府法办。赵天锁予以撤职处分。
