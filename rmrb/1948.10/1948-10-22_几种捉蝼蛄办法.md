Several Ways to Catch Mole Crickets

[Linzhang News] Now some wheat has emerged, and some is being planted. Mole crickets are occurring in many places. In order to protect the wheat seedlings, we specifically propose the following methods: (1) Dig ditches four to five feet long, two feet deep, and one and a half feet wide at both ends of the wheat field (two ditches must be dug at each end). If the land is very long, dig two ditches on each side. Pour one foot deep of large livestock manure (horse, donkey, mule, preferably horse manure) into the ditch. Cover the ditch opening with thin corn stalks. Place a bright lamp at the ditch opening at night. Dig out the manure in the early morning, and you can catch a lot of mole crickets. (2) Divide the large livestock manure into many small piles and place them in the wheat field (horse manure warms up after the autumn weather turns cold). Mole crickets often hide inside, and you can dig them up at any time to catch them. (3) In areas prone to mole crickets, you can look for them in manure piles in the fall, which is very effective.

　　几种捉蝼蛄办法
    【临漳讯】现在麦子有的已经出来了，有的正种，不少地方发生了蝼蛄，为了保护麦苗，特提出以下法办：（一）把麦地两头挖成长四、五尺，深二尺宽尺半的沟（每头须挖两个沟）。如地很长，在两边各挖沟二道。沟内倒入一尺深的大牲口粪（马、驴、骡，最好使马粪），沟口用稀薄的玉茭秸盖上，到晚上沟口放一个明灯，至清早将粪挖出，能捉很多蝼蛄。（二）将大牲口粪分成许多小堆倒在麦地里（秋后天凉马粪发暖），蝼蛄常藏在里边，可以随时刨开去捉。（三）在容易生蝼蛄地方，秋季可在粪堆里去找，收效很大。
