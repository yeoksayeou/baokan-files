[Jizhong Electric] Renhe and Anping counties in Jizhong have largely completed the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Party and government leading organs at all levels are actively leading the masses to transition to autumn cultivation and sideline production. In Renhe County, except for Chinese yams and peanuts, the harvesting of over 975,600 mu of major autumn crops such as sorghum and millet has been completed. Wheat planting throughout the county has also been largely completed. According to statistics from 165 villages in eight districts, 112,318 mu of wheat have been planted. Currently, autumn cultivation has generally begun throughout the county, along with sideline production. In Zhangzuo, Beishilizhuang, and three other villages in the tenth district, over 750 mu have been cultivated in autumn. Zhangzuo village alone cultivated over 180 mu in four days. Women in various villages have also begun sideline production such as spinning and weaving. Seven mutual aid groups in Zhangzuo village have transitioned from agricultural mutual aid to joint weaving and cotton ginning. Five middle peasant households, including Zhang Gang and Geng Suorong, have organized a sock knitting group. Gao Wunyao's weaving group has already started weaving cloth. In Dong'erzhuang, Jian'guo Thirteenth District, in order to develop sideline production, the branch assigned tasks to party members, requiring them to go deep into the joint groups and help formulate sideline production plans. Currently, two groups (seven households) are planning to sell Chinese yams, one group (four households) is frying and selling pastries, two groups are preparing to go out and cut grass, and three groups (fifteen households) are planning to go to Cang County to transport salt. The branch is now planning to launch winter production for women. The autumn harvest and wheat planting in various villages in Anping County are nearing completion. When cadres from the Third District of the county held a symposium with experienced farmers, they discovered that the wheat fields plowed and sown had a lot of weeds, which would easily breed pests next year. After studying with the masses, they decided to mobilize the masses to cut grass. Currently, in Cuigezhuang, 89 women and 40 men are cutting grass in the fields, with each person averaging 15 jin of wet grass per day. Those with livestock have solved the problem of livestock feed; five jin of dry grass can be exchanged for one jin of rice, and those without livestock can earn at least three jin of rice a day. In Donghuiwo in the Eighth District of Anping, many people weave Luo silk. After completing wheat planting, they have focused on weaving Luo silk. Ma Jiliang, Han Guoying, and others in Xingxian Village in the urban area helped each other finish planting wheat and continued to work together to scrape soil and extract niter, earning 36,000 yuan from one pool. The Anping County Party Committee has instructed all districts to promptly grasp the needs of the masses and vigorously lead the masses in autumn cultivation and sideline development in villages where wheat planting has been completed. It also pointed out that the Third District cadres' realistic work style of starting from reality, meeting the needs of the masses, and learning from the masses should be emulated by all districts. The County Party Committee instructed all districts to continue to complete wheat planting in villages where it has not been completed, while combining it with the development of sideline occupations. It is necessary to mobilize the masses in disaster areas to carry out grass cutting campaigns to prevent pests in wheat fields. In this way, the masses will not be forced to sell their livestock due to lack of feed, affecting autumn cultivation; at the same time, transportation can be carried out in winter to increase income. Some villages in Anguo, Raoyang, and other places have also begun to mobilize the masses for autumn cultivation and organize sideline production such as spinning and weaving, and niter boiling.

　　任河安平收种大部完成
  　转入秋耕开展副业
    【冀中电】冀中任河、安平等县秋收种麦已大部完成，各级党政领导机关正积极领导群众转入秋耕及副业生产。任河全县除山药、花生外，高粱、谷子等九十七万五千六百余亩大秋作物已收割完毕。全县种麦亦已大体完成。据八个区一百六十五个村统计，已种麦十一万二千三百一十八亩。现全县已普遍开始秋耕，并进行副业生产。十区张佐、北十里庄等五村，已秋耕了七百五十余亩，仅张佐一村四天中即耕了一百八十余亩。各村妇女并已开始纺织等副业生产。张佐村有七个互助组，已从农业互助转入了合伙织布、轧花。张岗、耿锁荣等五家中农，组织了织袜子组。高文耀的织布组已开始织布。建国十三区董尔庄，为了开展副业生产，支部对党员作了布置，要求党员深入到合伙组去，帮助作出副业生产计划。现在有两个组（七户）计划着卖山药，一个组（四户）炸卖果子，两个组准备出去割草，三个组（十五户）计划到沧县推盐。现在支部正计划开展妇女冬季生产。安平各村秋收种麦即将完成。该县三区区干部在召开老农座谈会时，发现犁种的麦地里草多，明年容易生虫；和群众研究后，就决定发动群众砍草。现在崔各庄已有八十九个妇女，四十个男子下地割草，每人每天平均割的湿草能落十五斤干草。有牲口的解决了牲口吃的；五斤干草能换一斤米，没牲口的一天最少也能收入三斤米。八区东会涡织罗的很多，完成种麦后，已经深入以织罗为主。市区兴贤村马纪良、韩国英等，互助耩完了麦子，又继续合伙刮土淋硝，一池子就赚了三万六千元。安平县委已指示各区，及时抓住群众需要，在种麦已完成的村，大力领导群众秋耕和开展副业。并指出：三区区干部领导上从实际出发，根据群众要求，向群众学习的实事求是的工作作风，各区应向他们学习。县委指示各区在没种完麦子的村，仍继续完成种麦，结合发展副业。要发动灾区群众，开展割草运动，防备麦地虫灾。这样，就不致使群众因没草喂而卖掉牲口，影响秋耕；同时，还可在冬季开展运输，增加收入。安国、饶阳等地有些村庄也已开始发动群众秋耕，组织纺织、熬硝等副业生产。
