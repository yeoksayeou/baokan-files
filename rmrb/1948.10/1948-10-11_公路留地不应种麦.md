　　Roadside Land Should Not Be Planted with Wheat
    To the Editor:
    The Shi-Xing highway was surveyed this spring but construction has not yet begun. Now it is time to plant wheat. Can the masses plant wheat on the land reserved on both sides of the road? After the road construction starts, how should the occupied land be resolved?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wen Xu, Second District, Zhengding

    Answer: According to the regulations of the Highway Bureau of the Department of Transportation, the Shi-Xing highway should reserve a width of forty-five chi (Chinese feet) according to the route surveyed this spring. The land ownership belongs to the public and should be reserved when issuing land certificates. It is not suitable to plant wheat again. For the land occupied from the masses, the government will find ways to adjust it.

    In addition, according to the regulations on land reservation, there should be a cart road for iron-wheeled vehicles along the highway (iron-wheeled vehicles are not allowed to run on the highway), with a width of fifteen to eighteen chi. If there is no original cart road outside this section of the highway, the base of the cart road should also be reserved according to the above-mentioned width to facilitate mass transportation.

    The government has special regulations for handling detailed methods of land reservation. Before the official announcement, the above-mentioned method can be temporarily reserved.

　　公路留地不应种麦
    编辑同志：
    石行公路是在今年春天测量的，至今尚未动工。现在已到种麦时期，路两边所留之地，群众是否能种麦子呢？此路动工后，所占之地应如何解决呢？　
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　正定二区文绪
    答　根据交通厅公路局的规定，石行公路应照今春测量路线留地宽四丈五尺，地权属于公有，颁发土地证时应留出，不宜再种麦子，占用群众土地，政府设法调剂。
    另根据留地办法的规定，沿公路线应有行驶铁轮车的大车路（铁轮车不许行驶公路），宽一丈五尺到一丈八尺，如果该段公路外原无有大车路时亦应照上述宽度留出大车路基，以利群众运输。
    关于留地详细办法政府专有规定处理，在未正式公布前，可照上述办法暂时留出。
