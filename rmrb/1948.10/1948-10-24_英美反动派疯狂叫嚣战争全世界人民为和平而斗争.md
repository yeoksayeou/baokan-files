The United Nations Security Council convened in Paris on October 4 to begin discussing the so-called Berlin problem. Before the Security Council decided to discuss this issue, the Soviet government had sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the 3rd, pointing out that the so-called "Berlin blockade" did not actually exist, and the Western countries' clamor about the "Berlin situation threatening peace" was purely propaganda. Based on the United Nations Charter, the Soviet government insisted that the Berlin and the entire German question should be resolved by convening a four-power foreign ministers' conference, rather than submitting it to the Security Council. However, under the manipulation of the United States, the Security Council passed a resolution on the 5th to include the Berlin issue on the agenda. The Soviet representative immediately made a solemn statement that he would not participate in the discussion, so the Security Council adjourned on the 6th. During the adjournment, the Argentine Foreign Minister launched a so-called "mediation" activity by small countries. At the Security Council meeting reopened on the 15th, the Argentine Foreign Minister attempted to lure the Soviet Union into participating in the discussion of the Berlin issue by inviting the four countries to answer questions. This conspiracy has been exposed by Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky reiterated that the Soviet Union would not participate in the Security Council's discussion of the Berlin issue, which put the imperialist countries in a very embarrassing situation. According to a Reuters report, the United States was flustered and indecisive after submitting the Berlin issue to the Security Council. This situation has greatly confused its British and French partners. The United Nations General Assembly is still carrying out the activities of various committees. The most important committee of the General Assembly—the Political and Security Committee—has so far generally discussed two important agendas: the Atomic Energy Commission report and the disarmament issue. Under the direction of the United States, the Atomic Energy Subcommittee passed a proposal on the 12th to stop the work of the Atomic Energy Commission. On this issue, Vyshinsky repeatedly warned the US-British bloc not to harbor the illusion of "monopolizing atomic energy secrets" and suggested that the Atomic Energy Commission should continue to work to formulate and implement two conventions on prohibiting atomic bombs and controlling atomic energy. On the issue of disarmament, the Soviet Union's proposal on five powers reducing their armaments by one-third in the coming year has become the focus of the General Assembly and has won the support of the people all over the world (New Era). In the discussion from the 7th to the 13th, the imperialist countries did not dare to openly oppose the clear proposals of the Soviet Union, but they were spreading ridiculous arguments that disarmament was difficult to implement and that disarmament should be premised on "creating an atmosphere of international trust."

On the eve of the General Assembly's discussion of the disarmament issue, the British Labor government announced a so-called "rearmament and delayed demobilization plan." Shortly thereafter, the governments of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, under the command of the United States, formed the so-called Western European Allied Forces Headquarters and appointed Montgomery as its commander. Across the Atlantic, there has long been a clamor for "military aid to Western Europe" and "restoring military lend-lease"; recently, there have been reports that "the US Department of Defense is preparing to equip 25 armored and tank divisions for the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg" (Paris Today). At the same time, the warmongers have also opened their throats. On October 7, Charles Saltzman, the US Assistant Secretary of State in charge of occupied territories, said in a speech that "war against the Soviet Union may still be inevitable"; on October 9, Churchill bluntly said that "the Third World War seems to be relentlessly approaching." This is a portrait of many "war maniacs" in recent times. These "war maniacs" have their own purposes of opposing the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, but we see that even in Britain, which shouts the loudest for "rearmament," when Defense Minister Alexander and Churchill called for conscription at recruitment rallies, their war cries were drowned out by the crowd shouting "We want peace, not war!" and "Don't fight for dollars!" Even some important government officials rebuked Churchill as a "reckless speaker" and a "dangerous element threatening peace." In France, the surging strike wave that is currently underway has powerfully demonstrated how fragile the foundation of the French ruling class is; what capital does it have to make a war gamble? As for the United States, the place where war propaganda is most rampant, the recent incident of Truman wanting to send Vinson to the Soviet Union for negotiations has occurred. This incident fully illustrates: in the United States, the "popular sentiment towards peace" is so strong, and American imperialism is so outwardly strong but inwardly weak, that the Democratic Party's next presidential candidate, in order to win over voters, actually disregarded how his "plan" would cause chaos in the US diplomatic front and took this step. The so-called "military aid to Europe" has its most realistic purpose for American monopoly capital. Republican Senator Capehart revealed this purpose in a radio broadcast on October 10, saying that if the United States "assists Western Europe in rearming," it will need to release 2 billion dollars in loans in the first year, which means selling 2 billion dollars worth of military supplies for the United States. For the "aided" countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands, they obviously want to use the clamor of "war against the Soviet Union" to facilitate the continuation of their despicable and sinful colonial wars. For a long time, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and other countries have been waging colonial wars in Malaya, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other places. Today, when they encounter many difficulties in colonial wars, what is so strange about their military alliance and their eagerness to obtain military assistance from the United States?

Following the nationwide warning strike of 7 million people for two hours on September 24, the French working class launched a new strike movement with a plan and steps from October 4. The strike started with coal miners in northern France, followed by steel workers in Lorraine, some railway transportation system workers, and dockworkers in all French seaports, which successively launched strikes, bringing the strike movement to a new climax. The workers firmly opposed the Geuy government's implementation of the Marshall's enslavement plan and demanded that the minimum wage be increased from 12,000 francs per month to 15,000 francs, and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. A notable feature of the recent stage of the French strike is the increasing unity of the French working class in action. In recent months, under the leadership of the General Confederation of Labor, representatives of the three major trade unions have formed joint trade union committees in thousands of enterprises, making the unified action of the working class begin to proceed on the scale of entire industrial zones and provinces since August. In this strike of 350,000 miners, including members of the Christian Workers' League and "Workers' Force," the workers unanimously declared that they would persist in the strike until victory. The restoration of unity is the greatest achievement of the French working people, and this achievement has rendered the divisive activities carried out by the French reactionaries in the working class since December last year futile. At the same time as the new wave of strikes was surging, the congress of the General Confederation of Labor, which has always insisted on struggling to defend the interests of the French working people, was held in Paris from the 11th to the 16th. The high tide of the French strike wave has aroused the horror of the American reactionaries. They are plotting to arrange a military dictatorship under the aegis of the United States. However, this will only arouse greater anger and unity among the French working people, thereby causing all the conspiracies of the American and French reactionaries to fail.

The Japanese Ashida cabinet, under the aegis of MacArthur, collapsed on October 7. Replacing it to form a cabinet was Shigeru Yoshida, the president of the notoriously reactionary Democratic Liberal Party. During its seven months in power, the Ashida cabinet had taken a series of reactionary measures, such as: freezing wages; giving huge subsidies to monopoly capitalists; imposing heavy taxes on civilians; devaluing the yen to facilitate US investment; following MacArthur's instructions to suppress strikes and enforce "arbitration," and so on. These reactionary measures have aroused widespread dissatisfaction and resistance from the Japanese people, especially the working class, which has been concentratedly manifested in the strike wave since August. The spark that prompted the collapse of the Ashida cabinet was the major scandal of the Showa Company. This event greatly deepened the anger of the Japanese people. The democratic forces, headed by the Japanese Communist Party, demanded the resignation of the Ashida cabinet, the dissolution of the parliament, and the formation of a clean democratic government, which was an important reason for the collapse of the Ashida cabinet. At the same time, the collapse of the Ashida cabinet was also due to the infighting within the Japanese ruling class. The Democratic Liberal Party had long been dissatisfied with the Ashida cabinet because of the uneven distribution of spoils. Nevertheless, since Japan is now de facto controlled by the United States, the fate of the Ashida cabinet was ultimately decided by MacArthur. This time, the Ashida cabinet was so stinking that MacArthur had to abandon it. MacArthur did this because: first, he attempted to ease the anger of the Japanese people and unload his responsibility for the Showa scandal; second, he took this opportunity to pave the way for the rise of the most reactionary Democratic Liberal Party. The newly ascended Yoshida cabinet is both more reactionary than the Ashida cabinet and more fragile. The Japanese reactionaries are fighting each other so fiercely in the face of the powerful democratic movement that Yoshida only obtained 185 votes of support out of the 466 votes in the parliament.

Other important international events in recent times are as follows:

(1) The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement and telegraphed friendly countries, requesting the establishment of diplomatic and economic relations with those countries. The Soviet government has replied, agreeing to establish diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries, and has appointed an ambassador.

(2) A million Italian government employees held a half-day strike on the 14th, demanding wage increases.

(3) The International Union of Students held a council meeting in Paris, attended by representatives from 30 countries. The meeting decided to strengthen the connection between the International Union of Students and democratic student groups in various countries. (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd)

### 英美反动派疯狂叫嚣战争全世界人民为和平而斗争

　　英美反动派疯狂叫嚣战争全世界人民为和平而斗争
    联合国安理会于十月四日起在巴黎集会，开始讨论所谓柏林问题。在安理会决定讨论这一问题之前，苏联政府曾于三日照会美英法三国政府，指出所谓“柏林封锁”实际上并不存在，西方国家关于“柏林情势威胁和平”的喧嚣，纯是一种宣传。苏联政府根据联合国宪章坚持柏林及整个德国问题，应召开四外长会议予以解决，而不应提交安理会。但是，在美国的操纵下，安理会于五日通过将柏林问题列入议程。苏联代表当即严正声明不参加讨论，安理会因此于六日起休会。在休会期间，阿根廷外长发起了所谓小国“调解”活动。在安理会十五日重开的会议上，阿根廷外长企图以邀请四国答复问题的方式，诱使苏联参加柏林问题的讨论。这一阴谋已为维辛斯基揭穿。维氏重申苏联不参加安理会讨论柏林问题，这样，帝国主义国家就处于很尴尬的境地。据合众社泄露，美国在将柏林问题提交安理会以后，行动慌张，举棋不定。这种情势已使其英法伙伴大感困惑。联合国大会仍在进行各委员会的活动。大会最重要的委员会——政治安全委员会，迄今已一般地讨论了两项重要议程：原子能委员会报告问题及裁军问题。在美国的指使下，原子能小组委员会已于十二日通过停止原子能委员会工作的建议。在此一问题上，维辛斯基曾一再警告美英集团勿存“垄断原子能秘密”的幻想，并建议原子能委会应继续工作，以拟制和实施禁止原子弹与管制原子能两公约。在裁军问题上，苏联关于五强在今后一年内裁军三分之一的建议，成为大会的焦点，并获得全世界人民的拥护（新时代）。在七日至十三日的讨论中，帝国主义国家对苏联的明确建议都不敢公然反对，但他们却在散布着裁军如何难于实行及裁军应以“造成国际信赖空气”为前提等本末倒置的可笑论调。
    当联大讨论裁军问题的前夕，英国工党政府却宣布了所谓“重整军备与延缓复员计划”。不久以后，美国指挥下的英、法、荷、比、卢五国政府，又组成了所谓西欧联军总部，并推定蒙哥马利为其统帅。在大西洋彼岸，好久以来就传出了“军事援助西欧”和“恢复军事租借”的喧嚣；最近，又传出“美国国防部准备装备英、法、荷、比、卢二十五个装甲师与坦克师”的消息（巴黎今晨报）。与此同时，战争贩子们也放开了他们的喉咙。十月七日，专司占领区事务之美助理国务卿沙尔兹曼在演说中称，“对苏战争或仍不能避免”；十月九日，邱吉尔更是露骨的说，“第三次世界大战似已无情来临”。这就是最近时期许多“战争狂”的一幅轮廓画。这种“战争狂”固有其反苏、反新民主国家的目的，但是，我们却看到，就是“重整军备”喊得最厉害的英国，当国防部长亚历山大及邱吉尔等在征兵集会上号召应征时，他们的战争叫嚣却被群众高喊“我们要和平不要战争！”“不要为美元作战！”的呼声所淹没。甚至政府的一些要员也斥责邱吉尔为“莽撞的演说者”，“威胁和平的危险分子”。在法国，刻正进行的汹涌澎湃的罢工浪潮，已经有力地说明了法国统治阶级的基础是这样的脆弱，它凭什么本钱去作战争赌博呢？至于在美国，这个战争宣传最嚣张的地方，最近却也发生了杜鲁门想派文森赴苏谈判的事件。这一事件充分地说明了：在美国，“人心向和”是如此强烈，美帝国主义又如此外强中干，以致这民主党下一届总统候选人，为了争取选民，居然不顾他的“计划”会使美国的外交阵线陷于如何的混乱而出此一着。所谓“军事援欧”，对于美国独占资本来说，有其最现实的目的，共和党参议员卡皮特在十月十日的广播中已经透露了这种目的，他说，如果美国“援助西欧重整军备”的话，第一年需要放出二十亿元的贷款，也就是说，为美国推销二十亿元的军火。对于受“援”的英、法、荷等国来说，它们显然是想在“对苏战争”的叫嚣下，以利于继续其卑劣罪恶的对殖民地战争。很久以来，英、法、荷等国即在马来亚、越南、印尼等地进行着殖民地战争。在今天，当他们在殖民地战争中遇到重重困难之时，他们的军事联合，他们之急于从美国那里得到军事援助，这又有什么奇怪呢？
    法国工人阶级继九月二十四日举行全国七百万人两小时的警告性罢工以后，自十月四日起又发动了有计划有步骤的新的罢工运动。罢工从法国北部煤矿工人开始，继之，洛林钢铁工人，一部分铁路运输系统工人及全法海港码头工人等，都彼伏此起的先后举行罢工，使罢工运动达到新的高涨。工人们坚决反对葛义政府执行马歇尔的奴役计划，要求工资最低额由每月一万二千法郎提高至一万五千法郎，及成立民主的联合政府。法国罢工最近阶段中的显著特征是法国工人阶级在行动中的日益团结。近数月来，在总工会的领导下，三大工会的代表们，已在数千个企业中组成了联合工会委员会，使得工人阶级的统一行动自八月份起已开始按整个工业区和省的范围进行。在这次包括基督教工人联盟和“工人力量”会员在内的三十五万矿工罢工中，工人一致宣布将坚持罢工到胜利之时为止。团结的恢复是法国劳动人民最伟大的成就，这一成就已使法国反动派自去年十二月以来在工人阶级中所进行的分裂活动成为徒劳。在新的罢工运动高涨的同时，始终为保卫法国劳动人民利益而坚持斗争的总工会代表大会于十一日至十六日在巴黎召开。法国罢工浪潮的高涨，引起了美国反动派的惊恐。他们正在阴谋安排一个美国卵翼下的军事独裁。但是，这只会激起法国劳动人民更大的愤怒与团结，从而使美、法反动派的一切阴谋归于失败。
    麦克阿瑟卵翼下的日本芦田内阁，已于十月七日倒台。代替它组阁的，是臭名远扬的民主自由党总裁吉田茂。芦田内阁在其执政的七个月中，曾采取了一系列的反动措施，诸如：冻结工资；对独占资本家给予巨额津贴；对平民课以重税；为便利美国投资而实行日圆贬值；遵循麦克阿瑟指令而实行镇压罢工、强制“仲裁”等等。这些反动措施曾引起了日本人民首先是工人阶级的广泛不满与反抗，它集中地表现为八月以来的罢工浪潮。促使芦田内阁倒台的导火线，是昭和公司的大舞弊案。这一事件，大大加深了日本人民的愤怒。以日共为首的民主势力，要求芦田内阁辞职、解散议会、组织清白的民主政府，是芦田内阁倒台的重要原因。同时，芦田内阁的倒台，也还由于日本统治阶级内部的倾轧。民主自由党许久以来就因分赃不匀而对芦田内阁不满。虽然如此，但由于日本现在事实上为美国所一手控制，芦田内阁之去留，最后还决定于麦克阿瑟。这次，芦田内阁实在太臭了，以致于麦克阿瑟也不得不舍弃它。麦克阿瑟之所以这样做，是因为：第一，企图缓和日本人民的愤怒，卸掉自己对昭和丑案的责任；第二，借此为最反动的民主自由党的上台铺平道路。新登台的吉田内阁，一方面是比芦田内阁更反动了，另一方面却又是更脆弱了，日本反动派在强大的民主运动面前，互相倾轧得这样利害，以致吉田仅获得议会的四百六十六票中一百八十五票的支持。
    最近时期国际上之其他重要事件如下：
    （一）朝鲜人民民主共和国政府发表声明，并致电各友好国家，要求与各该国建立外交及经济关系。苏联政府已予答复，同意两国间建立外交及经济关系，并已指派大使。
    （二）意大利百万政府雇员于十四日举行大半日罢工，要求增加薪资。
    （三）国际学联在巴黎举行理事会，到有三十个国家的代表。会议决定加强国际学联与各国民主学生团体的联系。　　（新华社陕北二十二日电）
