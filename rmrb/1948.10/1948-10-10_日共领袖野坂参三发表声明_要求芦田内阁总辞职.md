Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. TASS Tokyo dispatch: *Akahata* published on the 1st a statement by Japanese Communist Party leader Nozaka Sanzō demanding the immediate resignation of the Ashida government. Nozaka emphasized that the recently revealed Showa Electric Industries bribery scandal clearly demonstrates the corruption within the Japanese ruling clique. Nozaka called for the organization of a people's democratic government composed of representatives from untainted political parties and worker-peasant groups, and the dissolution of the current parliament.

According to Reuters: Communist Diet members Tokuda Kyuichi and Nozaka Sanzō, among others, met with Ashida on the 1st to demand the resignation of the Ashida Cabinet.

According to various reports: The Showa Electric Industries bribery scandal originated from the company's illegal acquisition of an improper loan of 2.867 billion yen from the Japan State-run Reconstruction Finance Bank. The loan obtained by the company exceeded ten times its capital and was used to cover losses and engage in the black market trading of fertilizers, with suspicions that a portion of it was embezzled by the Ashida Cabinet. The investigation into the case began in May and has become increasingly scandalous, involving a wide range of individuals. In addition to Showa Electric Industries President Hinohara, who was arrested two months ago, as many as 20 high-ranking officials and major capitalists have recently been indicted for assisting in the loan and accepting bribes, including Industrial Bank of Japan Vice President Ninomiya Yoshihisa, former Administrative Vice-Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Shigemasa Seishi, former Director-General of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance Fukuda Takeo, former Liberal Party President Ohno Banboku, and former Minister of Finance and current Minister of State and Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board Kurisu Takeo, who was arrested a few days ago.

Shigemasa Seishi and Fukuda Takeo have already admitted to accepting hundreds of thousands of yen in bribes after their arrest. After Kurisu's arrest, the three ruling party leaders—Ashida Hitoshi of the Democratic Party, Katayama Tetsu of the Social Democratic Party, and Miki Takeo of the National Cooperative Party—held an emergency meeting on the evening of the 1st. According to Reuters, they discussed countermeasures such as a partial cabinet reshuffle, a complete cabinet resignation, or a dissolution of parliament.

According to a TASS dispatch, MacArthur's headquarters is also implicated in this bribery case. Reuters reported that Ashida will pay respects to his master MacArthur within days to seek instructions. The Showa Electric Industries case and the Japanese cabinet crisis are still developing.
