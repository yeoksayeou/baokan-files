This is the only way out for the besieged enemy in the isolated city:
    Large-Scale Desertions from the Yan Army in Taiyuan
    Nearly Six Thousand Have Surrendered to Us in Two Months
    [Jinzhong Telegram] Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's officers and soldiers and Yan's puppet personnel trapped in Taiyuan are fleeing the doomed city to surrender to the liberated areas. According to statistics from the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan officer and soldier reception stations and six districts around Taiyuan, from July 25th to September 30th, a total of two months and six days, 6,096 people have fled to the liberated areas and surrendered to us (those received by the front-line troops are not included in the statistics). Among them are 2,076 regular soldiers from 25 units, including the enemy's Provisional 37th Division and Provisional 40th Division, 1,119 non-regular soldiers from 23 units, including the Security First Regiment and Security Third Regiment, 2,317 "People's Defense Army" members, and 584 Yan's puppet personnel. Among the surrendered officers are Zhang Shoufang, the regimental commander of the Second Regiment of the Eighth Column, and two battalion commanders. According to statistics from just one sub-district, those who surrendered with weapons brought four machine guns, six small cannons, eighty-one rifles, and six pistols. Since the Jinzhong Campaign, our army and people have jointly besieged Taiyuan, preventing Yan's bandits from venturing far to loot food. In early September, Yan's bandits gave each soldier in the front-line troops only eleven taels and five mace of bad rice per meal, while those in the rear only received nine taels. They were not full and still had to work on fortifications, leading to widespread disease. In the Sixth Company, First Platoon of the Third Regiment of the Provisional 35th Division, four out of eighteen soldiers had eye diseases, and six had dysentery. Soldiers openly搶食瓜菜、玉茭 from the masses in the suburbs.
    The day of the Liberation Army's liberation of Taiyuan is not far off. Most of Yan's troops have realized that following Yan's bandits leads to nowhere but being cannon fodder. Coupled with the propaganda and practical demonstration of our army's lenient policy and prisoner policy among the broad masses, everyone knows, "Come back! It's okay, the Liberation Army will give you food ration coupons and passes." The sayings "Those who were coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded" are spread everywhere. After such calls, families of Yan's puppet soldiers held "life-saving meetings," trying to persuade their husbands and sons to return. After they returned, they held "escape meetings," and those who performed meritorious service by surrendering held "celebration meetings," becoming a mass political offensive and struggle movement. The southeast, northwest, and northeast of Taiyuan city all have reception stations specially set up by our democratic government for Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's defected officers and soldiers, which are in charge of food, lodging, cigarettes, water, travel expenses, and other receptions for those who surrender. Many people near the masses and inside Yan's puppet army know that once Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's officers and soldiers escape, someone will guide them to this bright place: "Go there, the sign hangs to welcome you!" The dead end and the way out are very clear, and the number of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's officers and soldiers fleeing to surrender is increasing day by day. In the Seventh Company of the First Regiment of the Enemy's 40th Division, more than 20 people ran away in six days, and 65 people ran away from the Eighth Company. One village ran away one squad, and the platoon leader took a soldier to chase them, but the platoon leader and the soldier also ran away. In the Eighth Company of the Security Third Regiment, only the company commander was left, and the company commander also ran away on September 23.

　　这是孤城守敌的唯一生路：
    太原阎军大批逃亡
    两月间向我投诚者已达六千
    【晋中电】困守太原的蒋阎官兵与阎伪人员，纷纷逃出死城到解放区投诚。仅据七月二十五日到九月三十日两个月零六天，在太原周围的蒋阎官兵招待站及六个区收容的统计，逃到解放区及向我投诚者已有六零九六人（前沿部队收容者未统计在内）。其中包括敌暂三十七师、暂四十师等二十五个单位的正规军二零七六人，保一团、保三团等二十三个单位的非正规军一一一九人，“民卫军”二三一七人，阎伪人员五八四人，投诚军官中有八纵队二团团长张寿芳及大队长二名。携械投诚者，只一个分区的统计：带来机枪四挺、小炮六门、步枪八一支、手枪六支。按自晋中战役以后，我军民合力围困太原，使阎匪兵不能远出抢食。九月上旬阎匪给前沿部队的士兵每人每顿只新秤十一两五钱的坏大米，后边的只发九两，吃不饱还得作工事，疾病流行。暂三十五师三团六连一排十八个人，害眼病的四人，得痢疾的六人，士兵公开抢食城郊群众的瓜菜、玉茭。
    解放军解放太原的日子，为期不远，大部阎军都已认识到跟着阎匪毫无出路，只能充做炮灰，加上我军的宽大政策与俘虏政策在广大群众中的宣传与实际表现，就使群众家喻户晓，“回来吧！没有事，解放军给拿吃饭的粮票，开路条”。“胁从者不问，立功者受奖”等语到处传扬。经过这样的呼唤，阎伪军家属开“救命会”，想法到敌区劝夫叫子回来，回来再开“脱险会”，立功投诚者开“庆功会”，成为群众性的政治攻势与争取运动。太原城的东南西北都有我民主政府专设的蒋阎反正官兵招待站，专管投诚者食、宿、烟、水、路费等招待。附近群众与阎伪内部很多人都知道，蒋阎官兵一经逃出，就有人指引给他们这一光明的所在：“到那里去吧，挂的牌子招待你们！”死地与生路非常分明，蒋阎官兵纷纷逃来投诚者日众。敌四十师一团七连六天跑了二十余人，八连跑了六十五人。一村跑了一个班，排长带一个兵去追，结果排长与兵也跑了。保安三团的八连跑的只剩下连长一人，连长在九月二十三日也跑出来了。
