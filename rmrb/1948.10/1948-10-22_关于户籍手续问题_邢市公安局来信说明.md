　　Regarding Household Registration Procedures
　　A Letter of Explanation from the Xingtai City Public Security Bureau to the Editor:
　　Having read Mr. Li Yawen’s comments on the household registration management in Xingtai City, published in the Criticism and Suggestions column of the People's Daily on August 31st, we hereby provide the following response:
　　The complicated household registration procedures in Xingtai City did exist before the former Border Region government abolished the checkpoint pass system in the consolidated areas. However, since the promulgation of the Land Law Outline and the instructions of the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau regarding industrial and commercial policies, especially after the former Border Region government explicitly abolished the checkpoint pass system, this bureau has repeatedly studied the various procedures for household registration management, striving to make them convenient for businesses and beneficial to the people, and has modified them to the most simplified and necessary extent. For example, in the "Provisional Management Measures for Household Registration and Personnel Changes in Xingtai City" issued by this bureau in May of this year, the section on moving out only stipulates that: "Anyone moving out of this city must first return the original household registration form to the district household registration office, explain the reason for moving, and obtain a certificate before moving out; otherwise, it will be considered desertion." The section on moving in only stipulates that: "Those moving into the city from outside must submit a certificate from the government or organization above the village level of their original residence to the group household registration office for examination and approval before they can receive a household registration form, officially register, and be included in the household registration group; those without a certificate will not be allowed to reside in this city." This is because if people could move in and out freely without any certificates or necessary procedures, the security of Xingtai City would be affected. During a single household registration check, we discovered some unscrupulous elements hiding in the city to evade war duties, and even some criminals hiding from justice. This shows that without necessary household registration management in a city, it will not only affect the social order of the city but also the security of neighboring areas outside the city.
　　As for the statement in the article that "business personnel must immediately notify the household registration office when going out on business, otherwise, checking the household registration will be troublesome," there is no such provision in the city's household registration management measures that "business personnel must immediately notify the household registration office when going out on business." Checking household registration is the responsibility of comrades in charge of household registration work. Any failure to report household registration is a violation of government laws and regulations, not a "troublesome" matter. The article also states that "a letter of introduction from the village is required when registering a household, and even a letter of introduction from the district," which is also not stipulated. Instead, it is stated that an introduction from a certain organ or organization above the village level is sufficient, and it is not said that a letter of introduction from the village and also from the district is required. As for the statement that "if the village cadre is not good to you, they will not write a letter of introduction," that is a problem with individual village cadres, which can be resolved locally, and is not a flaw in the city's household registration regulations themselves. If there are any inappropriate aspects of the household registration law, it is necessary to put forward specific suggestions for modification for the government to consider, but necessary management methods for the city cannot be abolished. In the future, in addition to constantly listening to the opinions of the masses in the execution of security tasks and considering and revising various city management methods from actual practice, we also hope that everyone will abide by government laws and regulations and jointly maintain the peace of the city. Because the maintenance of social security order has no conflict with protecting the development of industry and commerce and the freedom of movement of the people.

### 关于户籍手续问题　邢市公安局来信说明

专栏：询问与答复

　　关于户籍手续问题
  　邢市公安局来信说明编辑同志：
    阅读八月三十一日人民日报批评与建议栏内，登载本市李亚文先生对邢台市户籍管理上的意见，特作如下答复：
    邢市户籍管理上的手续繁多，若在前边府未取消巩固区路条制度以前，检查起来确实存在。但自土地法大纲与前晋冀鲁豫中央局关于工商业政策的指示公布后，特别是前边府明令取消路条制度以来；本局对户籍管理上的各种手续规定，曾再三研究，力求便商利民，已修改至最简便与必要的限度。如本年五月本局印发的邢台市户籍与人事变动暂行管理办法内，迁出一项只规定：凡由本市迁出者，须先将原户口表交回区户籍室，并说明迁出原因，经批准后发给证明文件，即可迁出，否则即认为逃亡。迁入一项只规定：从市外搬来市内居住者，须由各街村将其原籍村以上政权机关团体之证明信，报团户籍室审查批准后，即可领取户口表正式登记编入户籍小组；无证明信者一律不准在本市居住。因为如果没有任何证明信件与必要手续，而自由迁入迁出，那么邢市的治安就会受到影响。仅就一次清查户口中，即发现了一些为逃避战勤而藏匿本市的不正派分子，甚至还有畏罪潜伏的坏分子。这说明一个城市没有必要的户籍管理工作，不但影响本市的社会秩序，也将影响到市外邻区的治安。
    至于文中所说“商铺人员因事外出，得立即通知户籍室，如不通知，查户口就得麻烦。”关于“商铺人员因事外出得立即通知户籍室”。本市户籍管理办法中，根本没有这样的规定，而查户口是担负户籍工作同志应尽的责任，遇有漏报户口等情，乃是违犯了政府法令，而不是什么“麻烦”问题。文中还说：“报户口时必须要村的介绍信更要区的介绍信”，亦无这样规定；而是说村以上的某一个机关团体介绍即可，并未说要了村的介绍信还要区的介绍。至于说“如果村干对你不好就不给写介绍”信，那是个别村干的问题，可由当地解决，而非本市户籍条例本身之毛病。如果户籍法有不妥之处，提出具体修改意见，以资政府参考这是必要的，但也不能取消了城市必要的管理办法。今后我们除在执行治安任务方面，经常听取群众意见，并从实际中考虑与修正各种管理城市办法外，同时希望大家遵行政府法规，共同维护本市的安宁。因为社会治安秩序的维持对保护发展工商业与对人民的行动迁移自由，并无矛盾之点。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　邢台市公安局　九月二十七日
