　　In the struggle against the new world-ruling aspirants, communist parties in various countries are fulfilling a glorious, historical task. They are leading the great anti-imperialist movement, encouraging and organizing the masses to resolutely counter the imperialist offensives.

　　In Western European countries, the communist parties are the mainstay of the people's resistance against the plunderous plans of American imperialism and its servants, the Bevins, the Bidaults, and the Gasperis.

　　In Eastern European countries, the communist parties are leading the governments, fully utilizing their ever-growing influence to unite the masses and guide the people's activities towards the path of further strengthening their democratic interests.

　　More and more, the masses are placing their hopes and confidence in the communist parties, and the best representatives of workers, peasants, and intellectuals are joining the communist parties in a continuous stream. The unity of the workers' movement, previously divided by capitalist agents, is being restored; the political unity of the broad masses of the people is vividly reflected in the people's democratic fronts of many countries. The people recognize that the communist party is the only unwavering, genuine, and fearless fighter for national sovereignty and the vital interests of the working people.

　　The closer contact between the communist parties and the masses, and the increase in the number of party members, sharply raise the issue of the theoretical training of party members—arming them with the theory of Marxism-Leninism as a guiding principle for successful work among the masses.

　　Comrade Stalin said: "The strength of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in its ability to enable the Party to find the correct guidance in any situation, understand the internal connections of current events, foresee the course of events, and know not only how they develop and in what direction they develop at present, but also how they will inevitably develop and in what direction they will develop in the future."

　　The course of social development in the previous century, the various events of the civil war years, the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union, its historical role in the war against Hitlerite Germany, and all events of the post-war period—all this is undeniable evidence of the greatness and invincible power of the theory of Marx-Engels, a theory which was brilliantly advanced and concretized by Lenin and Stalin during the period of imperialism and socialist construction. The power of the scientific foresight of Marxism-Leninism has overcome the adventurist policies of the reactionary rulers of the capitalist world and their echoers in the revisionist and reformist camps.

　　Therefore, it is very natural that in some new democratic countries, on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, the workers' parties are uniting and the unity of the working class is being restored. Marxism-Leninism is the only theory that correctly reflects the task of liberating the working class in each country.

　　The creators of Marxism-Leninism have constantly pointed out that revolutionary theory is not a dogma but a guide to action. Lenin emphasized that Marx's theory only laid the cornerstone for science, and that socialists must further develop this science in all aspects if they do not want to lag behind. This theory only provides general guiding propositions, which are applied in one way in Britain, another way in France, differently in France than in Germany, and differently in Germany than in Russia.

　　The activities of communist parties in different countries during and after the war, especially the work of communist parties in the new democratic countries, and the experience accumulated in the revolutionary movement and the construction of new democracy, contain rich materials for valuable theoretical generalizations and conclusions to further develop the theory of Marxism-Leninism.

　　The time has come to theoretically generalize the rich experience of building new democratic countries, analyze the class changes that have occurred in these countries, and define new methods to strengthen the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals; to scientifically analyze economic changes and mark out the future path towards socialism; to summarize the experience in the organizational structure of Marxist parties, to adapt to the characteristics of the party's development in new democratic countries.

　　In addition to theoretically generalizing their experience, another major task facing communist parties in various countries is the theoretical education of party members and the wide dissemination of Marxism-Leninism.

　　However, practice shows that there are many important shortcomings in the ideological and organizational aspects of Marxist-Leninist education. Failure to remove these shortcomings may lead to serious consequences.

　　For example, some communist party newspapers, the central organs of the party, rarely publish any articles on Marxist-Leninist theory, and there are almost no propaganda articles and reports on how party members should study Marxist theory.

　　Lack of interest in Marxist theory and neglect of propaganda work may lead to degeneration and the emergence of bourgeois views. Those organizations and communist party members who disregard theory, fail to see the sharpening of class struggle, the differentiation of class forces, and the enemy's conspiracies will inevitably develop petty-bourgeois complacency and arrogance; they begin to let things drift, harboring opportunistic illusions—believing that everything will be fine and that socialism will triumph regardless.

　　A party organization whose leaders show indifference to the propaganda of Marxist theory will inevitably lose all perception of the future, and one can expect the most absurd and pseudo-Marxist "ideas" and "theories." What is more, in these cases, pseudo-Marxism is usually disguised by "leftist" rhetoric.

　　It is obvious that without a love for Marxist theory, if theory is neglected, rather than painstakingly deliberated and popularized, criticism and self-criticism will be reduced to insignificant matters. But the essence of Marxism requires open, mass, party criticism and self-criticism, regardless of individuals; and disapproves of criticism behind the back.

　　The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), created and educated by the great geniuses of revolutionary theory—Lenin and Stalin—can serve as an example for all fraternal parties in how to study the development of Marxist theory and its propaganda among the broad masses of the people.

　　Nothing could stop or restrain the propaganda activities of the Bolshevik Party; neither the terrible Tsarist regime, nor the harsh measures of the puppets of world capitalism who came to power after the February Revolution of 1917—the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries.

　　After the October Socialist Revolution, developing and propagating Marxist-Leninist theory and promoting a scientific worldview among the broad masses became the main task of the Party and the State.

　　The success of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) in building socialism would perhaps have been impossible if the Party had not regarded the development of Marxism and the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres as of paramount importance.

　　Communist parties in various countries, aware of their shortcomings in Marxist-Leninist propaganda, are taking steps to overcome them.

　　We demand that the newspapers and theoretical organs of the executive committees of the parties participating in the "Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties" assume major responsibilities.

　　An important method to raise the theoretical level of party members is to publish a large number of Marxist-Leninist classics—the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

　　Along with the schools set up for the lower-level staff of the Party, it is necessary to improve the work of the advanced schools presided over by the executive committees of the communist parties in various countries by all means possible.

　　By raising the theoretical training of party members, the communist parties in various countries will be able to competently face the tasks before them in the struggle to defeat reactionary forces and in the construction of socialism in the countries that have freed themselves from imperialism.

　　共产党的思想武器
    情报局机关报“争取持久和平与人民民主”第十一期社论
    在反对新的统治世界的野心家的斗争中，各国共产党正在实现一项光荣的、历史的任务，他们领导着伟大的人民反帝运动，鼓励和组织群众对帝国主义的进攻予以坚决的回击。
    在西欧诸国，共产党是人民抵抗美帝国主义掠夺计划及其仆从贝文们、比道尔们、加斯贝利们的中坚。
    东欧各国的共产党在领导着政府，正充分使用他们一直增长着的影响来团结群众，并把人民的活动引向更加强他们的民主利益的道路上去。
    群众愈来愈把希望和信心寄托到共产党身上，而工人、农民和知识分子的最优秀代表则源源参加共产党。以前为资本主义代理人所分裂了的工人运动的统一正在恢复；人民广大阶层的政治统一则生动的反映到许多国家的人民民主阵线上。人民认识到共产党是国家主权与劳动人民切身利益的唯一不变的、真正的和无畏的斗士。
    共产党与人民群众的接触愈益密切、和党员数量的增加，就尖锐地提出了党员的理论训练——以马列主义的理论武装他们，做为在群众中胜利工作的指导原则的问题。
    斯大林同志说：“马列主义理论的力量在于它能使党在任何情况下找到正确的指导，了解当前事变的内在联系，预见事变的行程，不仅知道他们在目前如何发展与沿着什么方向发展，而且知道他们在将来必定如何发展与沿着什么方向发展。”
    前世纪社会发展的行程，内战年代的各种事变，苏联国内的建设社会主义，它在反希特勒德国战争中的历史作用，战后时期的一切事件——所有这一切都是马克思——恩格斯理论之伟大与无敌的力量之无可争辩的证据，这个理论在帝国主义与社会主义建设时期为列宁和斯大林光辉的推向前进并加以具体化。马列主义科学预见的力量，战胜了资本主义世界反动统治者及其修正主义、改良主义营垒里的应声虫的冒险主义政策。
    因此，在某些新民主主义国家内，在马列主义的基础上，各工人政党正在统一起来、工人阶级的统一正在恢复，那是非常自然的。马列主义是正确反映每一国家的工人阶级解放任务的唯一理论。
    马列主义的创造者们曾不断地指出：革命的理论不是教条而是行动的指南。列宁曾经强调说：马克思的理论仅仅为科学奠下基石，社会主义者如果不愿意落伍，就必须在各方面进一步发展这一科学，并且这个理论只提供了一般的指导命题，这些命题在英国运用是这样，在法国运用就是那样，在法国不同于德国，在德国又不同于俄国。
    不同国家中的共产党在战时和战后的活动，特别是共产党在新民主主义国家中的工作，革命运动和建设新民主主义所积累的经验，包括着丰富的材料可以作宝贵的理论上的概括和结论，进一步发展马列主义的理论。
    已经到了这样的时候：需要在理论上概括新民主主义国家建设的丰富经验，分析在这些国家已经发生的阶级变化与规定加强工、农和知识分子同盟的新方法，科学地分析经济上的变化与标出走向社会主义的将来道路，概括马克思主义政党组织机构方面的经验，以适合于党在新民主主义国家中发展的特点。
    除开在理论上概括他们的经验外，面对着各国共产党的另一重大任务是：党员的理论教育与马列主义的广泛宣传。
    可是，实践表明：马列主义的教育在观念形态上和组织上都有着许多重要的缺点。如不去掉这些缺点可能导向严重的后果。
    譬如，有些共产党的报纸，党的中央机关报，很少发表任何关于马列主义理论的文章，几乎没有关于党员如何研究马克思主义理论的宣传稿件和报导。
    对马克思主义的理论缺乏兴趣与忽视宣传工作，可能引向堕落与出现资产阶级的观点。那些置理论于不顾、看不见阶级斗争的尖锐化、阶级力量的分化和敌人的阴谋诡计的组织和共产党员，必不可免地会产生小资产阶级的自满和自高自大；他们开始听任事情自流，抱着机会主义的幻想——认为一切都会很好，而社会主义不管怎样都将会胜利的。
    其领袖对马克思主义理论的宣传表示冷淡的党组织，不可避免地会失去一切对前途的知觉，人们就能料到最荒谬的与伪马克思主义的“观念”与“理论”。尤有进者，在这些场合下，伪马克思主义通常是借“左”的玩弄词句来伪装的。
    显而易见，如果没有对马克思理论的爱好，如果忽视理论、而不是对理论苦心推敲并使之大众化，批评与自我批评就会降到不重要的地位。可是马克思主义的本质却要求公开的、群众性的、党的批评与自我批评，而不顾个人；而且不赞成背后的批评。
    为革命理论的伟大天才——列宁和斯大林——所创造所教育的苏联共产党（布尔什维克），在如何研究马克思主义理论的发展及其在广大人民群众中的宣传上，可做各兄弟党的范例。
    没有任何东西能停止或牵制布尔什维克党的宣传活动；无论是可怖的沙皇政权，或是一九一七年二月革命后当权的世界资本主义的傀儡们——孟什维克与社会革命党——的苛苦措置。
    在十月社会主义革命以后，发展与宣传马列主义理论和在广大群众中促进科学的世界观，就变成党和国家的主要任务。
    如果党不是把发展马克思主义和对干部的马列主义教育看成第一等的重要的话，苏联共产党（布尔什维克）建设社会主义的成功也许是不可能的。
    各国共产党意识到他们在马列主义宣传上的缺点，正在采取步骤来克服它。
    我们要求参加“共产党与工人政党情报局”的各党执委会的报纸与理论机关报负起重大的职责。
    提高党员理论水平的一个重要方法，是大量出版马列主义的名著——马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的名著。
    和为党的低级工作人员而设的学校一起，需要用一切办法改进各国共产党执委会所主持的高级学校的工作。
    各国共产党借着提高党员的理论训练，在击败反动势力的斗争中、和在摆脱了帝国主义的各国内建设社会主义中，将能以胜任面对着他们的任务。（程之平译）
