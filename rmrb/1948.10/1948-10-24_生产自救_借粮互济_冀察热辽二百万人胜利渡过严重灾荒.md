　　Production for Self-Salvation, Grain Loans and Mutual Aid
  　The People of the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Area Successfully Overcome the Severe Famine
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning, 13th] Under the correct leadership of the Central Bureau's policy of production for self-salvation, the people of the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning liberated area overcame natural disasters and Chiang Kai-shek's scourge, and successfully overcame this year's great famine. In the process of production and disaster relief, the cultivated area was expanded by three million mu, rural sideline occupations were developed, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was further strengthened.
    Due to natural disasters, plague, and especially Chiang Kai-shek's bandits implementing the "three alls policy" along highways, railways, and the eastern edge of Rehe, the disaster area was extremely wide, including the northeastern part of Hebei, the southern part of Hebei-Rehe-Chahar, and the entire province of Rehe (excluding a few counties and banners in the northern Zhaowuda League). The area along the Great Wall and the Jinzhou-Gubei Railway was the most severely affected. The total number of disaster victims reached two million, and more than 500,000 people were completely out of food. In the most severely affected counties, such as Lingyuan, Pingquan, and Xinhui, disaster victims accounted for 30 to 50 percent of the total population. In June of this year, the disaster situation developed to a considerably serious degree.
    Under these circumstances, the Party, government, army, and people responded to the call of the Central Bureau and were all urgently mobilized to engage in a movement to save the dying and seize the wilderness under the policy of production for self-salvation. In addition to leaving a small number of personnel to handle daily affairs, all government cadres went to the countryside to lead disaster relief work. Many provincial-level cadres also went to the countryside to personally grasp the situation and provide specific guidance. Production and disaster relief committees were organized from the province to the village to provide unified leadership, and the government allocated a large amount of relief grain and loans. The Rehe Provincial Government successively issued relief funds and grain loans of more than 2.59 million catties of millet, and the trade company loaned 500,000 catties of salt. Various localities also independently raised and transferred large quantities of materials to invest in production and disaster relief. For example, the eastern Rehe sub-district issued 625,000 catties of relief grain and grain loans, loaned 54,000 catties of bean cakes, 49,000 catties of cotton, and loans of 50 million yuan. Village peasant associations also cleared up fruits and invested all available materials into production.
    In the process of disaster relief, the leadership corrected the attitude of indifference or panic among cadres regarding the disaster, as well as the thinking of relying solely on higher authorities and pure relief. They used practical examples of some areas using government loans for sideline production, thereby solving the food problem, to educate the masses and gradually eliminate the lack of confidence in sideline occupations and the mentality of waiting for relief among the masses.
    In production and disaster relief, various sideline productions were universally organized, especially textiles. The Rehe Central Special District Factory used work-for-relief, lent out 405 spinning wheels, issued 1,100 catties of cotton, and wages of 16 million yuan, solving the food and seed problems of many farmers. The Rehe-Liaoning Trade Company also used work-for-relief methods to develop textiles. In two and a half months, the wages earned by the masses were equivalent to more than 3,400 shi (500 catties per shi) of coarse grains. Some trade companies went further to help the masses sell their products. According to the different conditions in various places, they also carried out various sideline productions such as gold mining, medicine digging, saltpeter boiling, alkali boiling, mat weaving, straw hat weaving, and fishing, combined with transportation, in exchange for grain.
    Mutual assistance and grain lending played a significant regulatory role in disaster relief. It was even more meaningful in areas where the disaster was not particularly severe. Due to the bias in the implementation of policies in some areas during last year's land reform, those who had surplus grain generally had concerns, believing that lending grain was a disguised form of struggle, and hid their grain. Based on this situation, the leadership first initiated the "handful of rice" movement in the Erdaowanzi District of Jianchang County, eastern Rehe, which was quickly accepted by the masses and rapidly spread to Xingcheng, Yebaishou, Lingyuan and other counties. In Yebaishou County alone, the masses mutually assisted and lent 255,000 catties of grain. This mutual assistance method solved the difficulties of many disaster victims in terms of food and seeds.
    All agencies and troops in the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning liberated area practiced strict frugality to save disaster relief, reducing their living standards. Each person saved one to four liang of millet per day. In order to save oil, everyone ate raw vegetables. In addition, they also donated their personal clothing to help disaster victims. Cadres went deep into the masses to help investigate and seize the wilderness, personally controlled disaster relief materials, helped the masses plan production, and worked with the masses. Some even used their own grain to relieve disaster victims, eating and drinking with the masses, making the relationship between the Party and the masses even closer.

　　生产自救·借粮互济
  　冀察热辽二百万人胜利渡过严重灾荒
    【新华社冀察热辽十三日电】冀察热辽解放区人民，在中央分局生产自救的正确方针领导下，克服了天灾蒋祸，胜利渡过了今年的大灾荒。在生产救灾过程中，扩大了耕地面积三百万亩，发展了农村副业，更加密切了党与群众的关系。
    全区由于天灾、鼠疫，特别由于蒋匪在公路铁路沿线和热东边缘区一带，实行“三光政策”，灾区范围极广，包括冀东北部、冀热察南部、热河全省（北部昭乌达盟少数县旗在外），其中以沿长城和锦古铁路一带为最严重。全部灾民达二百万，完全断粮者达五十万人以上，灾情最重之县，如凌源、平泉、新惠，灾民占全人口的百分之三十至五十。今年六月，灾情发展到相当严重程度。
    在这种情况下，党政军民响应中央分局的号召全体紧急动员起来，在生产自救的方针下，迅速投入救死抢荒运动。机关干部除留下少数人员处理日常事务外，全部下乡领导救灾工作。省级干部也多下乡亲自掌握情况具体指导，从省到村都组织了生产救灾委员会统一领导，政府并拨发了大批救济粮和贷款。热河省政府先后发出救济款及贷粮二百五十九万余斤小米，贸易公司贷出食盐五十万斤，各地并自行筹调大批物资，投入生产救灾，如热东分区即发出救济粮和贷粮六十二万五千余斤，贷出豆饼五万四千斤、棉花四万九千斤，贷款五千万元。各村农会并清理果实，将一切可用的物资投入生产。
    在救灾过程中，领导上纠正了干部中对灾荒漠不关心或者惊惶失措的态度，以及单靠上级和单纯救济观念的思想，并用一些地区把政府贷出物资用于副业生产，因而解决食粮问题的实际例子来教育群众，逐渐消除了群众中对副业无信心和等待救济的思想。
    在生产救灾中，各地普遍组织了各种副业生产，特别是纺织。热中专署工厂以工代赈，借出纺车四百零五架，发出棉花一千一百斤，工资一千六百万元，解决了不少农民的吃粮和种子问题。热辽贸易公司也用以工代赈办法发展纺织，两个半月，群众所得工资即折合粗粮三千四百余石（每石五百斤）。有些贸易公司更进一步帮助群众推销产品。根据各地不同条件，并开展挖金、挖药、熬硝、熬碱、编席、编草帽、捕鱼等各种副业生产，结合运输，换回粮食。
    互助借粮，在救灾中起了很大的调剂作用。在灾荒不十分严重地区，更有极大意义。由于去年土地改革中某些地区执行政策中的偏向，一般存有余粮者多有顾虑，认为借粮即是变相斗争，把粮食隐藏起来。领导上根据这种情况，首先在热东建昌县二道湾子区发起“一把米”运动，很快为群众接受，迅速开展到兴城、叶柏寿、凌源等县，叶柏寿一县群众即互助借粮食二十五万五千斤。这种互济方式，解决了许多灾民食粮种子的困难。
    冀察热辽解放区各机关部队在救灾运动中厉行节约救灾，降低生活水平。每人每日节约一两到四两小米，为了省油，大家便吃生菜。此外还纷纷捐出私人的衣物，用以救济灾民。干部多深入群众，帮助查荒抢荒，亲自掌握救灾物资，帮助群众计划生产，和群众一起劳动，有的还将自己的粮食救济了灾民，和群众一起吃喝，使党与群众的关系更加密切。
