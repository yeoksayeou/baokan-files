　　In Memory of General Feng Yuxiang
    General Feng Yuxiang died in a fire on a ship returning from the United States. We mourn his loss.
    Dong Biwu
  　General Feng Yuxiang died in a fire on a ship returning from the United States. I write this poem to mourn him.
    The sad news first came from the sea,
    The General's cremation turned him into an immortal.
    He once dominated the changing situation,
    His roar like a tiger and song like a dragon were not accidental?
    The Japanese devils had just surrendered, and the Americans came again,
    The General resisted without losing heart.
    A true Chinese man should be without shame,
    Following ancient teachings to cultivate righteousness.
    The Chinese people fought against fascism,
    The General personally led his comrades.
    Not tempted by the sweet words of the American Chiang Kai-shek,
    He was not confused about the path to a democratic future.
    Talented and versatile, he stood out from the crowd for a long time,
    The General, known as a soldier, was also a poet.
    He could write, paint, and sing,
    He could train brave soldiers to move ghosts and gods.
    Secret talks were his forte,
    The General went to the United States to bide his time.
    Now that he's gone, the grief only grows,
    When will his soul be called back to his homeland?

　　悼冯玉祥将军
    冯玉祥将军游美返国舟中失火竟以身殉职，为时吊之。
    董必武
  　冯玉祥将军游美返国舟中失火竟以身殉，为诗吊之。噩耗初从海上传，将军火化竟成仙。曾经咤叱风云变，虎啸龙吟岂偶然？日寇方降美又来，将军抵抗不心灰。中华汉子当无愧，古训遵遁正气培。中国人民反法西，将军袍泽手亲携。不为美蒋甘言诱，民主前途路未迷。多艺多才久出群，将军丘八号诗人。能书能画兼能唱，能练雄兵动鬼神。密室谈心语特长，将军留美欲韬光。而今隔世徒增恸，何日招魂返故乡？
