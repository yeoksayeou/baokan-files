　　The Third United Nations General Assembly opened in Paris on September 21. The Assembly will last for two months, and the agenda includes many issues of great significance to international peace and security. This session of the General Assembly is being held against the backdrop of increasingly sharp struggles between the world's democratic and anti-democratic camps. As in the past year, this General Assembly, since its opening, has unfolded a struggle between two diplomatic policies: one is the policy of strengthening the United Nations by striving to strengthen international cooperation, peace, and democracy, led by the Soviet Union and other democratic countries; the other is the policy of undermining the United Nations by the imperialist forces, led by the United States, that are trying to pursue expansion and world hegemony. U.S. imperialism has increasingly and obviously intended to completely transform the United Nations into a tool of its aggressive policies. Since the opening of the Assembly, the U.S. delegation has manipulated its followers, controlled important positions in the Assembly, and included on the agenda those issues that violate the Charter (especially reports on the so-called resident committees, the Balkan Committee, and the Korean Committee, three illegal organizations, as well as proposals to amend the veto power in the Security Council); U.S. Secretary of State Marshall also delivered a speech at the Assembly that was essentially aggressive but had to pretend to be "conciliatory" on the surface. The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys' conspiracies at the Assembly have been resolutely opposed and exposed by the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky delivered an incisive speech at the meeting on September 25, exposing the grave setbacks and failures of the United Nations over the past year caused by the U.S. imperialist diplomatic policies, and severely criticizing the warmongering cries of the U.S. and British war-mongers and their plans to prepare for a new anti-Soviet war. Vyshinsky's speech hit the U.S. reactionaries where it hurt. His clear stance, powerful citations, and sharp tone deeply moved representatives from many large and small countries. Vyshinsky also presented three proposals to the Assembly on behalf of the Soviet government: First, the five permanent members of the Security Council should reduce their existing land, sea, and air forces by one-third within one year; second, ban atomic weapons; and third, establish an international control agency within the Security Council to supervise and control the implementation of disarmament and the ban on atomic weapons measures. The Assembly has now ended its general speeches and entered the stage of committee activities and discussions of various proposals. The Soviet Union's three proposals are so just that the U.S. and British representatives dare not publicly oppose them, and they have been included in the Assembly's formal agenda.
　　The negotiations between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the Berlin issue over the past two months have broken down on September 26, due to the United States, Britain, and France's insistence on their anti-Soviet and anti-German people's stance. The Berlin issue was created single-handedly by the United States, Britain, and France more than three months ago. At the end of May and the beginning of June this year, the United States, Britain, and France held the London Six-Power Conference, decided to quickly merge the three occupation zones, and establish a West German separatist government. Immediately afterwards, on June 18, they implemented their so-called currency reform in West Germany and West Berlin, one of the purposes of which was to undermine the economic life of Berlin and the Soviet-occupied zone of East Germany. Therefore, the Soviet military government in Germany had no choice but to take immediate emergency measures, announcing a blockade of Berlin and the Western sectors, and transporting necessary food and fuel to Berlin, ensuring the lives of the Berlin people, thereby heavily dealing a blow to the U.S., British, and French plot to undermine the economy of Berlin and East Germany. At the end of July, in order to get out of this predicament, after repeated consultations among the three governments of the United States, Britain, and France, they sent a note to the Soviet Union, requesting negotiations on the Berlin issue. The Soviet Union, in the spirit of resolving disputes through peaceful consultation, agreed to hold negotiations. The four-power negotiations can be divided into three stages. The first stage was in Moscow, from July 31 to August 30; the second stage was in Berlin, from August 31 to September 7; and the third stage was from September 14 to 18, still held in Moscow. During the first stage of the four-power talks in Moscow, an understanding was reached that once the four-power governors of Berlin agreed on specific implementation measures, the current freight restrictions between Berlin and West Germany would be lifted simultaneously, and the German mark of the Soviet-occupied zone would be the only currency in Berlin. Unexpectedly, in the second stage, when the four-power governors of Berlin were discussing specific implementation measures, the United States, Britain, and France insisted on expanding the powers of the four-power financial committee originally intended to manage the circulation of currency in Berlin, so as to "manage," in effect, to interfere with the entire currency circulation of the Soviet-occupied zone, and at the same time demanded that water, land, and air freight between Berlin and West Germany be free from any control, so that the economic forces of U.S. imperialism could unimpeded invade Berlin and East Germany. Thus, the four-power negotiations on the Berlin issue did not achieve any agreement. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France submitted this issue to the Security Council on September 26, in violation of the Potsdam decision stipulating that the Berlin issue and the entire German issue should be handled by the four-power foreign ministers' meeting. However, in any case, this move will not help resolve the Berlin issue, and the U.S. imperialist aggression conspiracy will continue to suffer failure under the firm position of the Soviet Union.
　　Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people launched an armed uprising of patriotic self-defense in Madiun, East Java, on September 18. As a result of the uprising, the people's revolutionary regime has been established in Madiun and many surrounding cities and towns, and is resisting the attacks of the Hatta government's reactionary troops. The Madiun uprising opened a new period in the anti-imperialist national revolution carried out by the Indonesian people after World War II. From now on, the Indonesian people have drawn a clear line between themselves and the traitorous Sukarno-Hatta government and the Indonesian landlords and big bourgeoisie they represent, and, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, have embarked on the correct path of striving for national liberation and democratic freedom through revolutionary civil war. It is not accidental that the Indonesian people have embarked on this path. The facts of the past three years have shown that the policy of U.S.-Dutch imperialism to re-colonize Indonesia is stubborn and unchangeable, and in the protracted and brutal struggle against this colonial policy, the landlords and big bourgeoisie have moved from wavering to betraying the interests of the people. The Hatta government's withdrawal of Indonesian troops from behind enemy lines, the signing of a ten-year trade agreement with the United States, and the United States' exclusive control of all Indonesian exports are clear evidence of this. At the same time, the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of U.S.-Dutch imperialism, the increasing dissatisfaction of their own people with their aggressive wars, the increasing condemnation of world opinion, and the bankruptcy of their base means such as "mediation" and threats in the face of the increasingly awakened Indonesian people have forced them to try to use the Indonesian landlords and big bourgeoisie to strangle the Indonesian people's national revolution movement. This is evident in the U.S.-Dutch conspiracy to instigate Indonesian right-wing elements to stage a coup before the Madiun uprising, and their open announcement of support for the Hatta government's anti-revolutionary policy after the uprising. Therefore, the heavy responsibility of striving for Indonesian national independence and democratic freedom cannot but fall on the Indonesian working people and other patriotic elements led by the Communist Party. The Indonesian Communist Party clearly announced before the Madiun uprising: "The leadership of the country must be handed over to the progressive workers, and the land will be divided equally" (Muso's words). The revolutionary forces of the Indonesian people have become stronger in the past few months, especially due to the expansion of the Indonesian Communist Party and the growth of its influence in the armed forces. Although there are bound to be many difficulties and twists and turns on the road ahead, we believe that under the correct leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people will consolidate and expand the patriotic democratic united front against U.S.-Dutch imperialism and the traitorous Sukarno-Hatta government, strengthen the armed struggle of the whole people, implement necessary social reforms, and be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory.
　　Other important international events in recent times include:
　　(1) The Soviet government issued a statement stating that the Soviet troops stationed in North Korea will begin to withdraw from the area in the second half of October and complete this task by January 1 of next year. In contrast, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall told reporters that the United States "does not intend to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea."
　　(2) Soviet workers are enthusiastically launching a movement to reduce production costs and increase labor productivity in order to strive to increase socialist capital accumulation beyond the plan; Soviet farmers are completing and exceeding the grain delivery plan ahead of schedule.
　　(3) A general strike of seven million organized workers led by the French General Confederation of Labor was held on September 24, and this strike caused a dangerous shakeup in the Queuille cabinet, which had been established just two weeks earlier. The French Socialist Party officially split, and the left-wing group has formed a separate "Unified Socialist Party."
　　(4) The Italian Communist Party held a central plenary session, at which Togliatti spoke, emphasizing that the class struggle should be strengthened and opposing the danger of opportunism in the party's ranks. When Togliatti appeared for the first time in Rome after being stabbed, he was enthusiastically welcomed by 500,000 working people.
　　(5) The British Communist Party issued a statement calling on British workers to resist the Labor government's policy of attacking living standards.
　　(6) The U.S. Progressive Party has obtained full campaign qualification in twenty-four states. U.S. Communist Party General Secretary Dennis called for organizing mass demonstrations to oppose the trial of U.S. Communist Party leaders.

　　联大展开两种外交政策的斗争
    印尼人民反帝民族革命进入新时期
    第三届联合国大会已于九月廿一日在巴黎开幕。大会将历时两月，议程中包括许多对国际和平与安全具有重要意义的议题。本届大会是在世界民主阵营与反民主阵营间的斗争日益尖锐的情况下召开的。和去年一样，本届大会自开幕以来即展开了两种外交政策的斗争：一种是以苏联为首的民主国家力谋加强国际合作、和平与民主，从而加强联合国的政策；一种是以美国为首的帝国主义势力竭力追逐扩张和世界霸权从而破坏联合国的政策。美帝国主义已经日益明显地意图将联合国完全变为其侵略政策的工具。大会开幕以后，美国代表团操纵其从仆，把持大会的重要职位，并把那些违背宪章的议题（特别是关于所谓驻会委员会、巴尔干委员会、朝鲜委员会三个非法组织的报告，以及修改安理会中否决权的提案）列入议程；美国务卿马歇尔并在大会上发表了本质上是侵略的而外表上又不能不装作“和解”的演说。美帝国主义及其走卒在大会上的阴谋活动，受到苏联及新民主国家的坚决反对与揭露。苏代表团长维辛斯基九月二十五日在会上发表精辟的演说，尽情揭发美帝国主义的外交政策造成了联合国一年来严重的挫折与失败，并严厉抨击美英战争贩子的叫嚣和他们准备新的反苏战争的计划。维辛斯基的演说，打中了美国反动派的要害，他的立场的明确、引证的有力、词锋的锐利，使许多大小国家的代表为之深深感动。维辛斯基并代表苏联政府向大会提出三点建议，即：一、安理会五常任理事国在一年之内将现有陆海空军缩减三分之一；二、禁止原子武器；三、在安理会中建立国际管制机构，以监督与管制裁军与禁止原子武器措施的实行。大会现已结束一般性的演说，并进入各委员会活动及讨论各项提案的阶段。苏联的三点建议是如此富于正义性，以致美、英代表也不敢公然加以反对，故已被列入大会的正式议程。
    苏美英法四国两月来就柏林问题所举行之谈判，由于美英法三国坚持其反苏反德国人民立场，已于九月廿六日宣告破裂。柏林问题是在三个多月以前，由美英法三国一手造成的。美英法等国于本年五月末六月初举行了伦敦六国会议，决定迅速合并三占区，成立西德分裂政府，并随即于六月十八日在西德及柏林西区实行其所谓货币改革，其目的之一为破坏柏林以及东德苏占区的经济生活。因之，德境苏联军政府不得不立刻采取紧急措施，宣布封锁柏林与西区交通，并将必要的粮食与燃料运送柏林，使柏林人民的生活有了保障，从而沉重地打击了美英法破坏柏林及东德经济的阴谋。七月末，美英法为摆脱这一困境，三国政府间经过多次计议之后，照会苏联，要求对柏林问题进行谈判。苏联一本以和平协商解决争端的精神同意举行谈判。四国谈判可分三个阶段。第一阶段在莫斯科，自七月三十一日至八月三十日；第二阶段在柏林，自八月三十一日至九月七日；第三阶段自九月十四日至十八日，仍在莫斯科举行。当四国代表第一阶段在莫斯科会谈时，曾获致谅解，即一旦柏林四国总督商妥具体实施办法时，即同时实行取消柏林与西德间的现行货运限制及以苏占区之德国马克为柏林唯一通货。不意在第二阶段当柏林四国总督会商具体实施办法时，美英法竟坚持扩大原定管理柏林通货流通的四国财政委员会之职权，以“管理”实际上即干涉整个苏占区之货币流通，同时并要求柏林与西德间之水陆空货运不受任何管制，以便美帝国主义经济势力畅通无阻地侵入柏林和东德。就这样，关于柏林问题的四国谈判结果没有获得任何协议。美英法三国政府已于九月二十六日将这一问题提交安理会，违背了规定柏林问题以至整个德国问题由四国外长会议处理的波茨顿决定。然而，无论如何，此举决无助于柏林问题的解决，而美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，在苏联的坚定立场之下，定将继续遭受失败。
    印尼人民在印尼共产党领导之下，于九月十八日在东爪哇的茉莉芬城举行了爱国自卫的武装起义。起义的结果，人民的革命政权已在茉莉芬及其周围不少城乡建立起来，并正抗击着哈达政府反动军队的进攻。茉莉芬起义，揭开了印尼人民在第二次世界大战后所进行的反帝民族革命的新时期。从今以后，印尼人民在自己与卖国的苏加诺——哈达政府及其所代表的印尼大地主大资产阶级之间，划清了界线，并在印尼共产党领导之下，走上了以革命的国内战争来争取民族解放与民主自由的正确道路。印尼人民走上这条道路，并不是偶然的。三年来的事实表明：美荷帝国主义使印尼重沦为殖民地的政策，是顽固不变的，在反对这一殖民政策的持久而残酷的斗争中，大地主、大资产阶级从动摇一直到叛卖人民利益。哈达政府之撤退印尼敌后军队，与美国签订十年贸易协定，让美国独占印尼全部出口，即为明证。同时，美荷帝国主义的外强中干，它们的侵略战争之为其本国人民日益强烈的不满和世界舆论日益增涨的非难，他们的“调处”和威胁等卑劣手段在日益觉醒的印尼人民面前的破产，使得它们不得不设法假手于印尼大地主大资产阶级来绞杀印尼人民的民族革命运动。这见之于茉莉芬起义前美荷阴谋策动印尼右翼分子举行政变，起义后又公开地宣布支持哈达政府反对革命政策。因此，争取印尼民族独立和民主自由的重任，不能不落到以共产党为首的印尼劳动人民及其他爱国分子身上。印尼共产党在茉莉芬起义前已明确宣布：“国家的领导权必须交到进步的工人手里，土地将予平分”（穆索语）。印尼人民的革命力量，在过去数月中，特别由于印尼共产党的扩大及其在武装部队中影响的增长而更加坚强。尽管前进的道路上必然有不少困难和曲折，但我们相信印尼人民在印尼共产党正确领导下，巩固与扩大反对美荷帝国主义与苏加诺——哈达卖国政府的爱国民主统一战线，加强全民的武装斗争，实行必要的社会改革，定能克服一切困难，取得最后胜利。
    最近时期国际上之其他重要事件为：
    （一）苏联政府发表声明，留驻北朝鲜之苏军将于十月下半月开始撤离该地，至明年一月一日完成此项工作。与此相反，美国务卿马歇尔告记者称，美国“不拟自南朝鲜撤退美军”。
    （二）苏联工人正热烈展开减低生产成本、提高劳动生产率，以争取超过计划增加社会主义资本积累的运动；苏联农民正提前完成并超过纳粮计划。
    （三）由法国总工会领导的七百万有组织工人的总罢工于九月二十四日举行，这一罢工使成立甫告两周的葛义内阁，发生了危险的动摇。法国社会党正式分裂，左翼集团已另组“单一社会党”。
    （四）意共举行中央全会，托格里亚蒂在会上演说，强调应加强阶级斗争并反对党的队伍中的机会主义的危险。当托格里亚蒂于受刺后在罗马首次出现时，受到五十万劳动人民狂热的欢迎。
    （五）英共发表声明，号召英国工人抵抗工党政府所采取的对生活标准进攻的政策。
    （六）美国进步党已在二十四州中取得完全的竞选资格。美共总书记但尼斯号召组织群众示威，反对审讯美共领袖。　　（新华社陕北四日电）
