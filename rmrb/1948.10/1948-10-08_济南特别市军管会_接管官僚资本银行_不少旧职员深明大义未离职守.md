Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th -- The Jinan Special Municipality Military Control Commission is currently taking over the banks of the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital in Jinan and the local post office. The Kuomintang bureaucratic capital-run banks in Jinan that have been identified include the Jinan Branch of the Central Bank, the Jinan Branches of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, the Jinan Office of the Central Trust Bureau, and the Shandong Provincial Bank Headquarters, all of which are being taken over by the Military Control Commission. When our army liberated cities such as Weixian and Yanzhou, the aforementioned Kuomintang bank employees were deeply impressed by the correct policy of "welcoming those who stay, and sending off those who leave" and "rewarding those who have made contributions and punishing those who are lazy or destructive." Therefore, after the liberation of Jinan, all employees of the various banks in Jinan, from the president, manager, or deputy manager and director, to the section chiefs, heads of departments, and general staff and workers, with the exception of a few individuals, did not leave Jinan. Many did not leave their posts and properly preserved the accounts, registers, and all materials of the various banks, awaiting takeover. Among them, the chief accountant of the Jinan Branch of the Central Bank often listened to broadcasts from our Shaanbei Xinhua Radio Station and understood the situation of how the democratic government handled the Weixian bank employees. Therefore, at the start of the Jinan campaign, he placed the bank's various forms and accounts in a safe to prevent loss. After the liberation of the commercial port (where most of the banks were located, and the first area to be liberated), the employees of the Shandong Provincial Bank contacted the People's Liberation Army and requested protection because our takeover personnel had not yet arrived. During the current takeover period, all bank employees are handing over their responsibilities in their original positions and with their original salaries.

In addition, the post office and its seven sub-branches (all located in the city), under the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Military Control Commission, resumed operations at their original locations on September 27th, accepting and sending mail. On the 27th, within half a day, eighty-eight former post office employees reported for duty, willing to serve the people's postal service. The original post office director, a Mr. Mei, also led the original section chiefs to report on the same day. In addition to the complete restoration of Jinan's postal service, the Jiaoji West section postal transport line was officially opened on the second day of Jinan's liberation (September 25th).

　　济南特别市军管会
    接管官僚资本银行
    不少旧职员深明大义未离职守
    【新华社济南六日电】济南特别市军事管制委员会，顷正分别接管济南国民党官僚资本之银行以及当地邮局。济南国民党官僚资本所办银行，业经查明有中央银行济南分行，中国、交通、农民三银行济南支行，中央信托局济南办事处及山东省银行总行等，正由军管会接收中。上述国民党各银行职员，于我军解放潍县、兖州等城市时，对银行职员采取“留者欢迎，去者欢送”及“保护有功者奖，怠工破坏者罚”的正确政策，印象甚深。故济市各银行职员在解放后，上自行长、经理、或副理、主任，中至各课课长、股长，下至一般行员及工友等，除个别人员外均未离济，并有不少人员未离职守，而将各银行帐目表册及所有物资，妥为保存，静待接收。其中如中央银行济南分行会计主任，经常收听我陕北新华电台播音，深明民主政府处理潍县行员的情形；故济市战役开始，他即将该行各种表册、帐目放人保险箱内，以免遗失。山东省银行职员在商埠（按银行大部在商埠，该地最先解放）解放后，因我接管人员尚未赶到，即向解放军取得联系，要求保护。现在接管期间的各银行职员，均按原职原薪进行交代。
    又军管会邮电部所属之邮局及其下属七个支局（均在市内），已于九月二十七日在原址开始办公，收寄邮件。解放前旧邮局人员在二十七日半天内即有八十八人前来报到，愿为人民的邮政事业服务。原邮局局长梅某亦于是日带领原各股股长前来报到。现除济市邮递业已完全恢复外，胶济西段邮运干线，亦于济南解放之第二日（九月二十五日）正式通邮。
