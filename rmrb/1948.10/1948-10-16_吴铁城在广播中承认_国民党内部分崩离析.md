　　Wu Tiecheng Admits in Broadcast that
  　The Kuomintang is Disintegrating Internally
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Central Committee, admitted in a broadcast on the 2nd of this month that the internal disintegration of the Kuomintang reactionary group has become the Kuomintang's "fatal wound," "major crisis," and "the most significant attrition and loss." He announced that the Kuomintang has six major ailments: "First is suspicion—everyone is suspicious and wary, deceiving each other, with no mutual trust. Second is jealousy—unwilling to cooperate with others, instigating slander, engaging in all kinds of infighting, creating friction, using any means necessary, making everyone fearful and insecure in their positions. Third is partiality—an excessive emphasis on personal preferences, favoritism without fairness, promoting one's own followers and suppressing dissenters, creating an evil trend of forming cliques and flattering superiors. Fourth is callousness—rushing to seize profits and fearing to lag behind, never taking the lead in righteousness, only talking about advantages and disadvantages, not valuing morality, engaging in open and covert struggles by any means necessary. Fifth is hypocrisy—lacking a humble heart for seeking knowledge, disregarding public opinion, looking down on everything, and not seeking self-reflection. Sixth is superficiality—considering adherence to laws and responsibility as pedantic, regarding practical and solid work as incompetence, spending all day vying for advancement and adapting to circumstances, unwilling to do any real work, seek real learning, or tell the truth." (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd) Although Wu Tiecheng confessed to these "ailments" of the Kuomintang, he concealed the most important fact, which is the root of these "ailments"—the Kuomintang reactionary group's traitorous, dictatorial, and anti-people nature, and that this group's rule is heading towards an irreversible demise under the attack of the People's Liberation Army.

　　吴铁城在广播中承认
  　国民党内部分崩离析
    【新华社陕北十四日电】国民党中央党部秘书长吴铁城于本月二日广播中承认国民党反动集团内部的分崩离析，已成为国民党的“致命之伤”，“莫大危机”，“最重大的消耗和损失”。他宣布国民党存在六大病象：“第一是猜疑——大家猜疑提防，尔虞我诈，毫无互信。第二是嫉忌——不愿与人合作，挑拨中伤，百般倾轧，制造磨擦，不择手段，使人人危惧，不安于位。第三是偏私——人我之见过强，徇私偏爱不尚公道，入主出奴党同伐异，造成了结党营私，逢迎阿谀的恶风。第四是冷酷——攘利恐后，赴义不先，只讲利害，不尚道义，明争暗斗不择手段。第五是虚伪——无求知之虚心，不顾众议，目空一切，不求自反。第六是浮嚣——以守法负责为迂腐，以践履笃实为无能，终日奔竞适应，不肯做一实事，求一实学，说一实话。”（中央社南京二日电）吴铁城虽然供认了这些国民党的“病象”，但他隐瞒了最重要的事实，这就是构成这些“病象”的根源——国民党反动集团的卖国独裁的反人民的本质，以及这个集团的统治正在人民解放军攻击下正在走向不可挽救的灭亡。
