To the Editor:

Regarding the article "Shijiazhuang Xili Village Mistakenly斗了 (struggled against) an Outsider, Why No Compensation?" published in the "Voices of the People" section of the People's Daily on September 23rd, we immediately convened a meeting that same day with the four main village cadres of Xili Village, including the village head, the chairman of the farmers' association, and the director of the armed forces committee, to examine the truth and details of the matter, as well as the reasons for its occurrence. We also guided the village cadres in conducting a serious self-criticism. To understand the issue more truthfully and clearly, we conducted several separate interviews and investigations with some of the masses who knew about the matter. After understanding the issue from these various perspectives, we believe that there were indeed errors in the handling of Cao Fenghan's matter, especially the failure to promptly return his goods after receiving proof from his village of origin. Comrade Lao An, who previously worked in the village, and the village cadres have made deep self-criticisms regarding these errors. However, the true situation and details of certain issues differ from what Cao Fenghan stated, particularly the underlying cause of the problem, which Cao Fenghan did not mention. We hereby present the true situation as we understand it and the reasons for its occurrence as follows:

(1) After the liberation of Shijiazhuang in November of last year, there was indeed a serious problem of localism and rejection of outside residents among local village cadres and the masses. This was because the local area is located very close to the city, with a large population and little land (for example, Xili Village has an average of only about one mu of land per person), a large number of outside residents, and a complex situation, including many people of unclear origin (including escaped landlords and collaborators). The local masses were afraid that these people would divide the land and reduce their own acreage, so they took actions to drive away outside residents or prevent them from sharing in the distribution of goods. Cao Fenghan was among these people, which once caused unease among outside residents. However, when the district authorities discovered this, they quickly corrected it, and in the land reform, outside residents with clear origins were also given a share of land and property.

(2) The main reason for asking Cao Fenghan to leave Xili Village was that his origins were unclear and his behavior was bad, which led the cadres and the masses to suspect him and mistakenly believe that he was an escaped landlord. According to the investigation, Cao moved to Xili Village from Shijiazhuang City in 1939 (he did not have a certificate of origin from his original district and village when he came). He first made a living by treating sores, then colluded with the Japanese and puppets and served as the acting secretary of the warehouse management of the Japanese and puppet cooperative. After that, he took advantage of his position to flaunt his power in the village and act recklessly, raping two women (the wives of Wang Yuke and Wang Yunshan). After the Japanese surrender, Cao briefly switched to petty trading. After the Kuomintang came to Shijiazhuang, he soon colluded with the die-hard elements and joined the financial section of the Kuomintang Shimen Engineering Team. His wife came to the village in 1946 and said that his family had been struggled against, and they fled here because they were afraid to stay at home, and often spread rumors. After the Zhengtai Campaign in April of last year, Cao sent his 18-year-old son Xiaoquan to Beiping because he was afraid that the People's Liberation Army would approach Shijiazhuang (his daughter was also in Beiping). After the liberation of the village, the cadres and the masses naturally suspected him of being an escaped landlord based on his past words and deeds, and the fact that he had raped women made the masses even more resentful. Therefore, the cadres and the masses agreed to let him return to his place of origin, but the so-called "driving him out of the village on the day of heavy snow on December 13th" was not true. Instead, he was allowed to return to his place of origin several days before the 13th, and a mule cart was brought to take away his belongings.

(3) The so-called "confiscation of all his materials earned by labor" is also not true. In reality, only 103 catties of salt, a small box of old car parts, and a set of uniforms were confiscated. All other materials were allowed to be taken away. The reason for confiscating the car parts, salt, and uniforms was that during the period immediately after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, when the remnants of the enemy had not been eliminated and the city was still under military control, blockade, and martial law, and illegal purchasing personnel were strictly prohibited from reselling materials. The patrol team saw Cao's wife secretly (not openly) selling salt, so the patrol team suspected that the salt was of unknown origin and feared that it was stolen goods and confiscated it. The car parts and uniforms were confiscated when all his materials were put on the cart before he left, and the patrol team was asked to check whether there were any military supplies or industrial equipment. The patrol team mistakenly identified the car parts as military machinery parts and the uniforms as military clothing and confiscated them, which was a misunderstanding. Other daily necessities and materials were all allowed to be taken away, and the so-called confiscation of overcoats and foreign cloth is false. Later, Cao came with a certificate from his place of origin to retrieve the confiscated materials, but the main reason for not getting them back was that the materials mentioned in the letter he brought did not match the actual confiscated items (he said there were more, but the actual number was less). The village cadres felt that he was being unrealistic and could not return the items, so the problem was delayed. Finally, we hope that Cao Fenghan will come to our district again to work with the cadres and the masses who handled this matter at the time, to further clarify the rights and wrongs in a spirit of seeking truth from facts, dispel misunderstandings, and return his actual materials.

### 石市第七区政府说明　西里村扣留曹凤汉物资经过

　　石市第七区政府说明
    西里村扣留曹凤汉物资经过
    编辑同志：人民日报九月二十三日“群众呼声”中登载“石家庄市西里村，错斗了外来户为何不补偿”一文，我们当日即刻召集了西里村村长、农会主席、武委会主任等四个主要村干部，开会检查这件事情的真实情况与经过，及其发生的原因；并启发村干部进行了认真的自我检讨。为了把问题弄的更真实，更清楚起见，我们又向知道这件事情的一些群众，作了几次分别的访问调查。经过这样几方面的了解，我们认为对曹凤汉问题的处理确实有错误。特别是扣留他的物资以后得到其原籍村区证明，而未及时退还。对于这些错误，曾在该村工作的老安同志与村干同志都作了深刻的检讨。但是某些问题的真实情况及其经过与曹凤汉所说尚有出入，特别是问题发生的基本原因，而曹凤汉没有提及。谨将我们所了解的真实情况与其发生原因，说明如下：
    （一）石市于去年十一月刚解放后，当地村干与群众确实存在严重的本位主义与排斥外住户思想的。因为当地的特点是紧靠城市，人多地少（象西里村每人仅平均一亩来地），外来户多，情况复杂，且有许多来历不明（逃亡地主顽伪人员均在内）。当地群众怕他们在这里分了土地减少自己的亩数，所以有撵走外住户，或不让外住户分东西的举动，曹凤汉也在其内，曾一度引起外住户不安，但当区里发觉后，当即很快纠正，并在土改中对来历清楚的外住户也同样分得了一份土地财产。
    （二）让曹凤汉离开西里村的主要原因，是由于他的来历不明，行为不好，而引起干部群众对他的怀疑，误为逃亡地主。据调查曹于民国二十八年由石家庄市内移居西里村（当时来此并没有他原籍区村证明信），先以治疮为生，后与日伪勾结，并充当了日伪合作总社管理仓库的代理书记，此后借势在村耀武扬威，胡作胡为，曾强奸两个妇女（王玉可之妻和王云山之妻），日本投降后，曹一度转业小商，国民党来石后，不久又与顽伪拉拢参加到国民党石门工程队财政股服务。他妻于三十五年亦来本村，来后说他家是被斗户，因不敢在家而逃到这里，并时常制造谣言。去年四月正太战役后，曹因害怕解放军进逼石市将其十八岁的儿子小全送往北平（他女儿也在北平）。该村解放后，干部与群众按其以往言语行为，自然怀疑他是逃亡地主，并由于他曾强奸妇女，更使群众痛恨，因此干部与群众都同意让他回其原籍，但是所谓“十二月十三日下大雪之日将其赶出村外”并非事实，而是早在十三日之前数日，即让他回原籍，找来骡子大车拉走他的物资。
    （三）所谓“将他劳力经营的物资完全扣留”也非事实。实际只扣留他食盐百零三斤，旧车子零件一小箱，制服一套，其他物资全部让他拉走，而扣留他车子零件食盐制服等，是在石市刚解放，残敌人员未被肃清，尚在军事管制封锁戒严期间，严禁非法采购人员倒弄物资情况下，纠察队见曹之妻偷（不公开）卖食盐，因此纠察队怀疑他食盐来历不明，怕是偷盗物资而扣留。车子零件与制服是在临走时将其全部物资弄到车上后，让纠察队检查是否有军用物资，或工业器材，纠察队将车子零件误认为军用机器零件，制服误认为军衣而加扣留，实属误会。其他日常群众用具物资等全部让他拉走，所谓扣留大衣洋布都属非是。以后曹又持原籍证明信来取扣留物资，而未弄走主要原因，是曹来时带的信上所提物资与实际扣留者不符（他说的多，实际数少）。而村干感到他不求实际无法退还，故使问题拖延。最后我们希望曹凤汉再来本区一趟，协同与当时处理这件事情的干部与群众，一本实事求是的精神更进一步分明是非，解除误会，退还其实际物资。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（石家庄市第七区政府）
