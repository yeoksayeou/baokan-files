　　Clarify that Loans Should Not Be Treated as Relief
　　Xiaqu Masses Return Old Loans
　　[Taihang News] Xiaqu Village, Fourth District of Shahe, began borrowing from banks in March of the 25th year of the Republic of China, for three consecutive years, nine times in total, borrowing 2.89 million yuan, without ever repaying on time. The branch had written letters and sent cadres to the village dozens of times to urge repayment. But each time, the cadres said, "Our village is poor. We were robbed by bandits once in the past, and many livestock were stolen, resulting in huge financial losses. Last year's hailstorm in the autumn was also very severe, and we haven't recovered yet." Later, they said, "The poor and hired peasants are in power, we can't speak up." The bank cadres also did not delve into the specific situation and purpose of the loans, and vaguely agreed to postpone the repayment. Cadres and the masses regarded loans as relief, and seeing that the cadres did not repay, they all delayed repayment. Recently, when earnestly urging the repayment of loans under a unified policy, the branch cadres first convened a village branch meeting to mobilize, and then conducted a comprehensive investigation of each household to understand the above situation. Then, they convened a mass meeting, explaining in detail that loans were for production, and collecting payments was for the purpose of making loans, also for production. They encouraged everyone to boldly examine what the loans were used for in the past and whether it was appropriate. It was found that many people in the past used the loans for weddings, Chinese New Year, and burials. But many households used them for production. Then, the leadership guided the households that used the money improperly to examine their own mistakes and shortcomings. Party member Zhang Heng said, "If we only borrow and don't repay, it will be difficult to borrow again. Loans are meant to help us engage in production and live a good life, not to be wasted. The superiors come to urge the repayment of loans and inspect the purpose, it is to help us produce and become rich." Zhang Bao said, "Our village is too untrustworthy with loans. Delaying repayment for three years really hinders the masses from borrowing loans for production. I have a broken waterwheel that I want to repair, but because our village's loans have not been repaid, I can't get a loan." The village chief said, "We could have collected one part in May, but the cadres didn't urge repayment, and I was too embarrassed to go to the bank for a loan, which delayed a lot of good business." After everyone's self-criticism, the following ideas were also criticized: (1) Low interest rates, large loan profits, and prices are gradually rising, delaying one day is cheaper than another. Paying back makes us afraid that we won't be able to borrow again. (2) Last winter, many former loans were transferred to the poor and hired peasants or directly loaned to the poor and hired peasants. Now that the old cadres have returned to their posts, they are pushing it away. (3) The distribution of property has not ended, and people are afraid that paying the money will reveal that they are capable. After criticism, 500,000 yuan was paid on the spot. Together with the 1.14 million yuan previously paid, only 1.25 million yuan remained. Since they could not pay it all on the spot, everyone agreed to pay it off in ten days.

　　明确贷款不应当作救济
    霞渠群众归还旧贷
    【太行讯】沙河四区霞渠村，从民国二十五年三月开始向银行借贷，一连三年九次，贷款二八九万元，没有按期偿清过一次。支行曾经写信和派干部亲自到村催要过数十次。但干部每次都说：“俺村穷，过去被土匪抢过一次，抢走牲口很多，钱财损失顶大。去年秋季雹灾也很严重，一直到现在没喘过劲来。”后来则说：“贫雇当权，咱不能说话了”。银行干部也不深入了解具体情况与用途，糊涂的就答应了延期。干群把贷款当成救济，又看见干部不还，便都拖延不还。最近在统一方针下认真催收贷款时，支行干部首先召开村支部会做了动员，又深入各户普遍调查，了解上述情况后，即召开群众大会，详细说明贷款为了生产，收款为了贷款，也是为了生产。启发大家大胆检讨过去贷款作何用、是否正当。发现不少人过去贷了款，都用在结婚、过年、埋人上了。但也有许多户用于生产。接着，领导上启发用款不当户，检讨了自己的错误与缺点。党员张恒的说：“光贷不还，再贷就难。贷款叫咱们闹生产，过好时光，不是叫浪费的。上级来催收贷款和检查用途，是帮助咱们生产致富。”张报的说：“咱村贷款太不讲信用了，拖延三年不还，确实妨碍群众贷款生产。我有个破水车想修，因咱村贷款没还，我就没法去贷了。”村长说：“过五月本来能收一部，可是干部没催收，俺没脸上银行贷款，耽误了好多好生意。”经过大家自我检讨，又批判了如下几种思想：（一）利息低，贷款利大，物价逐渐上涨，拖延一天便宜一天。交了怕再贷不上。（二）去冬不少前贷款转给贫雇或直接贷给贫雇，现在旧干部复职了，推着不管。（三）平分未结束，怕交款落出有办法。经过批判，当场即交了五十万元。连原前交的一一四万元，只剩下一二五万元，当场确实交不了，大家说定十天交齐。
