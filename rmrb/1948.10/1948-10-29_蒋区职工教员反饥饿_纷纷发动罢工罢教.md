Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th—Comprehensive reports indicate that workers, clerks, and teachers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are launching anti-hunger strikes, class boycotts, petitions, and hunger strikes to protest the Kuomintang’s series of reactionary measures following the "currency reform," including ceasing cost-of-living salary adjustments, reducing the benefits of public employees and teachers, freezing wages, and abolishing workers' welfare subsidies. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 20th, over four thousand primary school teachers in Peiping have been boycotting classes for four days to demand improved living conditions. They have put forward demands such as the allocation of coal for the winter, the issuance of one month's salary for the purchase of winter clothing, and the lending of another month's salary. Chinese employees of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs held a sit-down strike on the 22nd of this month to demand a pay increase. Reuters pointed out that "this is the first strike by civil servants since the introduction of the gold yuan currency on August 19th." After the wages of all workers in the Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Government were frozen, making it impossible to maintain a living, they requested a one-third increase in wages and the allocation of food rice in September. According to the Peiping World Daily, Nanjing rickshaw pullers held a general strike on the 2nd of this month, and rickshaws disappeared from the entire city. In the morning, more than two hundred rickshaw pullers collectively petitioned the Kuomintang Nanjing Municipal Social Bureau, demanding the abolition of price controls, and more than ten people were arrested and sent to the "Special Criminal Court." Loading and unloading workers of the Kuomintang’s Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Administration sent more than twenty representatives to petition the bureau on September 3rd, demanding higher wages. On the 4th, the number of petitioners increased to more than one hundred, including representatives from various locations along the line and workers from Shanghai Station. According to the Shanghai Zhengyan Daily on September 19th, salt workers in Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Xikang provinces have launched a hunger strike to protest the Kuomintang government's increase in the "salt field construction fee" and the abolition of salt worker welfare subsidies. Other local salt industry associations have also telegraphed the "National Salt Workers Union" to argue their case on just grounds.
