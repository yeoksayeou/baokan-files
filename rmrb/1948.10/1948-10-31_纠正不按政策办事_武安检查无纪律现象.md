　　Correcting Malpractice
　　Wu'an Inspects for Lack of Discipline
　　[Taihang Electric] In order to ensure the correct implementation of policies and successfully complete the land reform, the Wu'an County Party Committee convened an enlarged county-wide cadre meeting from the 2nd to the 12th of this month. With the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, they strictly examined the state of disorganization and lack of discipline in previous land reform work, and determined future leadership methods and work systems. At the meeting, the County Party Committee first made a self-criticism based on the historical review of Wu'an's land reform. Subsequently, many cadres, in light of their respective village situations, compared their actions against the policies and recognized that in the past, due to a lack of understanding of the Party's policies and a lack of organization and discipline, they had violated policies during implementation, causing losses to the work. For example, worker Ying Youhui said: "When I went to work in Dongshang Village, I saw that other villages were carrying out the movement enthusiastically, and I also wanted to show off and establish personal prestige. So as soon as I arrived in the village, I told the village cadres that I estimated that there were eight households in your village that had not been thoroughly struggled against. The village cadres dared not say it was wrong. Later, I told the County Party Committee that the masses' opinion was that they had to be struggled against, so the struggle began. Now it seems that those struggled against were all middle peasants, and this is all my responsibility." Wang Wu said: "The sub-committee only decided to struggle against forty-odd industrial and commercial households (note: this decision was already wrong), but in order to show my determination, I added more than twenty households." Many comrades admitted that it was not that the policy had changed, but that they themselves, in order to show off and establish personal prestige, did not act according to the instructions of the higher authorities, or distorted the implementation of the policy, seriously endangering the work. After the examination, everyone agreed that this state of disorganization and lack of discipline must be overcome, otherwise there would be great trouble. In order to clarify the relationship between the individual and the organization and overcome individualism, they also studied Comrade Chen Yun's "How to Be a Communist Party Member," which had a great effect. Finally, everyone discussed and decided that in the future, everything must be done in accordance with the policies, because the Party's policies represent the highest interests of the vast majority of the masses. Violating the Party's policies is a great loss to the interests of the Party and the people. In order to make fewer mistakes, or to be able to correct mistakes immediately when they occur, a strict reporting system must be implemented: Usually, district cadres report to the district three times every ten days on the 1st, 4th, and 7th. The district reports to the county three times every ten days on the 2nd, 5th, and 8th. In case of emergencies, report on the same day, and conduct frequent criticism and self-criticism, strengthen unity within the Party, study regularly, and improve ourselves and our work. In terms of work methods, we must rely on the Party's policies, grasp the specific situation, hold good meetings, make good plans, and constantly supervise and check the degree of implementation.

　　纠正不按政策办事
  　武安检查无纪律现象
    【太行电】为了保证政策的正确执行，胜利完成结束土改，武安县委于本月二日至十二日召开全县扩大干部会议，以批评与自我批评的精神，严格检查了以往土改工作中的无组织无纪律状态，确定了今后的领导方法与工作制度。会上，县委首先从武安土改的历史检查中做了自我批评，接着有不少干部都联系本村情况，对照政策，认识了过去由于不明白党的政策与缺乏组织性、纪律性，在执行中违犯了政策，使工作受到损失，如工作员英有会说：“我到洞上村工作时，看到其他村搞运动很热烈，我也想显一手，建立个人威信，所以一到村就给村干部说，我估计你村有八户没斗彻底。村干部也不敢说不对，后来我给县委说了一下，说群众意见非斗不行，就斗开了。现在看来，斗的都是中农，这都是自己的责任。”王五的说：“分委会只决定斗四十多户工商业（按：这个决定就是错误的），我为了表示坚决，就外加了二十多户。”有许多同志检讨：不是政策变了，而是自己为了亮一手，建立个人威信，不按上级政策指示办事，或把政策执行的走了样，严重地危害了工作。经过检查，大家一致认为这种无组织无纪律的状态必须克服，不然还要出大乱子。为了明确个人与组织的关系，克服个人主义，又学习了陈云同志的“怎样做一个共产党员”，起作用很大。最后大家讨论确定：今后一切要按政策办事，因为党的政策是代表最大多数的群众的最高利益。违犯党的政策，对党对人民利益即是莫大的损失。为要少犯错误，或有了错误能即时纠正，要严格汇报制度：平时区干部向区汇报是逢一逢四逢七，十天三次。区向县是逢二逢五逢八，十天三次。有紧急事情，本日汇报，并要经常进行批评与自我批评，加强党内团结，经常学习，提高自己，提高工作。在工作方法上，要依靠党的政策，掌握具体情况，开好会，做好计划，经常督促，检查执行的程度。
