Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 1st -- Revolutionary order is being rapidly established in the city. The Military Control Commission, which entered the city to begin work on the day of Jinan's liberation, is actively promoting various measures. The battlefield in the commercial district has been cleared, and the city is being actively cleaned up. Liberation Army soldiers are maintaining order at all major intersections, and patrol teams are patrolling back and forth, ensuring stability in the city. On the 27th, the Military Control Commission sent personnel to begin repairing the city's telephone system, actively organizing the lines. The power plant is also being actively repaired. The plant's original employees, responding to the call of the Liberation Army to continue working, have been coming to the plant to register. As of the morning of the 28th, 172 of the original 220 employees had returned to work. They are now inspecting and repairing machinery damaged by the Kuomintang army and cleaning the interior of the engine room.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 1st -- Our correspondent reports: The bombing and strafing by Kuomintang aircraft has not caused any disruption in Jinan. The recovery and reconstruction work in Jinan is proceeding tensely under the protection of anti-aircraft forces. Patrol teams wearing shoulder patches are patrolling back and forth in the streets. Endless lines of prisoners are being escorted out of the city. Citizens are gathered at places where the Liberation Army's "Seven Articles of Agreement" are posted, attentively memorizing this proclamation.

When the reporter traveled from the Second Commercial Avenue to the city, most of the buildings seen along the way were intact. However, the steel and concrete building where the enemy Chiang's Second Pacification Zone Headquarters was located had been destroyed by artillery fire, leaving only blackened ruins. A large number of captured and destroyed tanks and armored vehicles were piled up in front of Pulimen on the edge of the city. Citizens are assisting the Liberation Army in dismantling bandit troops' fortifications, and many people have found their own doors, windows, tables, chairs, and sofas in these fortifications.

On the shore of Daming Lake, Liberation Army soldiers are busy collecting many weapons and ammunition abandoned by the enemy and clearing the enemy corpses from the littered lakeside. The famous Baotu Spring was hit by three large bombs dropped by enemy planes, causing considerable damage to nearby houses and trees. The caretaker told the reporter, "It's such a pity!"

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 1st -- While the Jinan battle was still raging, the cultural troupe of a certain column of the Liberation Army entered the commercial district with the army to carry out propaganda work. The troupe's reading room attracted a large audience. One group of troupe members was responsible for explaining the photos of the Liberation Army's past battles to the audience, one group introduced the general idea of the displayed books, and one group distributed propaganda materials. The reading room had a suggestion box and a question and answer section. Citizens raised many questions, such as the exchange rate between Chiang's currency and the Bohai currency, the content of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, all of which received satisfactory answers. The owners of seven factories, including Huafeng Machine Factory and Chengfeng Flour Mill, sent representatives to inquire about the Liberation Army's methods of protecting factories. The troupe suggested that nearby patrol teams properly protect the factories, and reported the factory owners' opinions to the Military Control Commission, which immediately sent personnel to provide effective protection. The next day, more than a hundred merchants, shopkeepers, and managers came to the reading room requesting a copy of a booklet on industrial and commercial policies.

　　济南迅速建立革命秩序
    防空部队保护下紧张进行重建工作
    望不到头的俘虏行列正往市外解送
    【新华社济南一日电】本市革命秩序在迅速建立中。本市解放当日即入市办公的军事管制委员会，正积极推进各项措施。商埠区战场已打扫完毕，城内亦正积极打扫中。各马路要口均由解放军战士维持秩序，纠察队往来巡逻，市面安定。二十七日军管会已派员着手修复市内电话，积极进行整理线路。发电场亦在积极修复中。该厂原有员工响应解放军继续供职的号召，纷纷到厂报名。截至廿八日上午，原有员工二百二十人中已有一百七十二人到厂复工。现正检查与修理被国民党军损坏的机件，进行机房内部的扫除工作。
    【新华社济南一日电】分社记者报导：国民党飞机的轰炸扫射并未造成济南的任何紊乱，济南的恢复与重建工作均在防空部队保护下紧张进行。佩带肩章的纠察队在街头往来巡逻。望不到头的俘虏行列正在往市外解送。市民们聚集在贴有解放军约法七章的地方，聚精会神地记着这一文告。
    记者沿商埠二大马路前往城内时，沿途所见楼房大多完整无损，惟蒋敌第二绥区司令部所在地的钢骨水泥大楼，已被炮火击毁，仅存乌黑的残骸。城边普利门前堆积着缴获和击毁的大批坦克和装甲车。市民正协助解放军拆除匪军工事，许多人在这些工事里找到了他们自己的门窗、桌椅和沙发。
    在大明湖畔，解放军的战士们正在忙碌地收集敌人遗弃的许多武器和弹药，并清除那些狼藉湖边的敌军尸体。著名的趵突泉被敌机投落三枚大的炸弹，附近房屋和树木受损失不少，看管人对读者说：“太可惜了！”
    【新华社济南一日电】济南战斗仍在激烈进行时，解放军某纵队文工团即随军进入商埠区进行宣传工作。该团的书报阅览室吸引着大量观众。文工团员们有一个组负责向观众解释解放军历次战役的照片，一个组向观众介绍陈列书籍的大意，一个组散发宣传品。阅览室设有读者意见箱和疑问解答处。市民们曾提出许多问题，如蒋币与北海币的比值、三大纪律、八项注意的内容等，都得到完满的答复。华丰机器厂、成丰面粉厂等七家厂主曾派代表向文工团询问解放军保护工厂办法，文工团一面建议附近纠察队对工厂妥为保护，一面把厂主们的意见报告军事管制委员会，该会随即派员予以切实保护。次日即有百余商家店主、经理前来阅览室，要求发给他们一份关于工商业政策的册子。
