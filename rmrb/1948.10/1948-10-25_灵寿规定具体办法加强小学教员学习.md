[Beiyue News] At the autumn vacation teacher conference, Lingshou conducted examinations and tests in three subjects: Chinese, Arithmetic, and General Knowledge. 22% of teachers failed. In the General Knowledge questions, some answered that Molotov was French, some answered that Tito was American, many did not know which province Chengde was in, and some answered that the new democratic education policy was "democratic centralism," or that "students love teachers, and teachers love students is the new democratic education policy." Of the thirty-eight teachers in the fourth district, twenty-five could not explain the phrase "扬眉吐气" (yang mei tu qi, to hold one's head high). Some said it meant "a worried look," and others said it meant "the smell of breath when you lift your head." Many teachers also could not explain the word "合同" (contract). Compositions were generally incoherent and contained many typos. In the arithmetic test, some did not know how to use parentheses, some did not know how to use equal signs, and some did not know how to use decimal points. The tests revealed that the teachers' cultural level was too low, which affected the improvement and development of education work. The leadership is now classifying teachers according to their usual work and cultural level, and studying methods to strengthen learning. It stipulates that each central elementary school should form a teacher learning group to strengthen cultural learning. Cultural courses are combined with professional courses, and learning materials are uniformly stipulated by the county. It also requires research and discussion, with each person keeping learning records. County and district cadres should check notebooks when going to the countryside. The county's educational association will issue educational communications as a weapon to promote, encourage, reward, and criticize teachers' learning, and conduct regular tests. At present, each district has repeatedly discussed and made a learning plan for each person.

　　灵寿规定具体办法加强小学教员学习
    【北岳讯】灵寿在秋假教员会议上，曾举行国语、算术、常识等三门课程的考试测验，不及格者达百分之二十二。在常识题中，有人答莫洛托夫是法国人，有人答铁托是美国人，不少人不了解承德在哪省，有人答新民主主义的教育方针是“民主集中制”，“学生爱老师，老师爱学生是新民主主义的教育方针”。四区三十八个教员，有二十五个不能解释“扬眉吐气”几个字，有人说是“发愁的样子”，有的说是“抬起头来吐出的气味”。还有很多教员不能解释“合同”两个字。作文一般不通顺，错白字很多。算术测验，不会用括号的，不会用等号的，不会用小数点的，样样都有。测验中看出，教员文化水平太低，影响教育工作提高与发展。领导上现正按教员平时工作情形，文化水平等划分教员等级，研究加强学习方法；规定每个中心小学为一个教员学习小组，加强文化学习。文化课与业务课相结合，学习材料由县统一规定。并要求研究讨论，每人要有学习记录，县区干部下乡要抽查笔记，县教联出教育往来，作为推动鼓动奖励批评教员学习的武器，并举行定期测验。现各区均经过反复讨论，每人都作了学习计划。
