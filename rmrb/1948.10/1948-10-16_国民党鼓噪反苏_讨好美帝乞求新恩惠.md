　　Kuomintang Drums Up Anti-Soviet Sentiment
　　To Please the American Imperialists and Beg for New Favors
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th】Moscow Radio broadcast Masinu's commentary on the Kuomintang's recent intensified anti-Soviet propaganda on the 2nd of this month. The commentary pointed out that the Kuomintang's recently intensified anti-Soviet propaganda, carried out through the Yishi Daily, the Jiuguo Daily, and its organ, the Heping Daily, which it controls, has two purposes, domestic and foreign. The domestic purpose is to try to divert the people's attention, so that they do not pay attention to the increasingly severe economic, political, and military crises of the Kuomintang. The foreign purpose is to try to please American capitalists. This intensification of anti-Soviet propaganda is taking place at the same time as the Kuomintang is conducting new military aid negotiations with the United States, Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu is going to the United States to beg for aid, and Zhang Qun is returning from a visit to Japan. The Kuomintang attempts to influence the most reactionary and ambitious groups in the United States with its frantic anti-Soviet movement, hoping to obtain new favors from the United States. The commentary continued to point out: The first time the Kuomintang begged for American military aid, it always carried out anti-Soviet propaganda at the same time. This time it is aimed at the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Because this treaty prevents the Kuomintang from signing a separate peace treaty with Japan, and prevents Zhang Qun and MacArthur from discussing the American plan to restore Japan's military and economic potential, thereby hindering the establishment of the "Sino-Japanese-Korean East Asian Alliance." The commentary concluded: "The realization of these three plans will lead to the revival of Japanese militarism and turn her into a source of new aggressors. In other words, what these plans require is exactly what the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance opposes. The Sino-Soviet Treaty is a guarantee of peace and security in the Far East, and a guarantee to prevent the revival of Japanese aggressors. Therefore, the Kuomintang propagandists who are currently serving American expansionism are actively opposing this treaty."

　　国民党鼓噪反苏
  　讨好美帝乞求新恩惠
    【新华社陕北十二日电】莫斯科电台本月二日广播马西努对国民党最近加强反苏宣传的评论。评论指出：国民党最近通过其控制下的益世报、救国日报及其机关报和平日报等所加强进行的反苏宣传，有对内和对外的两个目的。对内的目的是企图借此转移人民的视线，使他们不注意国民党最近经济、政治和军事危机的更加剧烈化。对外的目的是企图借此讨好美国资本家。这个反苏宣传的加强，是在国民党与美国进行新的军事援助谈判，财政部长王云五赴美乞援，张群访日归国同时进行的。国民党企图以其疯狂的反苏运动，影响美国最反动、最有野心的集团，希望得到美国的新恩惠。评论继指出：国民党第一次乞求美国军事援助，同时总要进行反苏宣传，这一次是针对中苏友好同盟条约。因为这一条约阻碍了国民党单独与日本签订和约，阻碍了张群与麦克阿瑟所商讨美国实现恢复日本军事经济潜在力的计划，从而阻碍了“中日韩东亚同盟”的建立。评论最后指出：“这三个计划的实现，将使日本军国主义复兴，和将使她变成新侵略者的发源地。换句话说：这些计划所要求的东西，天是中苏友好同盟条约所反对的。中苏条约是远东和平与安全的保障，是阻碍日本侵略者复活的保障。因此现时替美国扩张主义效劳的国民党宣传员积极反对这个条约。”
