　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Reuter's London, 25th: The Chairman of the British Communist Party, Gallacher, issued an open letter to the Secretary of War, Shinwell, regarding the Labor government's rearmament plan, stating: He never thought that Shinwell, once a militant social democrat, would be so easily used by the ruling class. Gallacher told Shinwell: When you decide to send young people to their deaths, to the swamps and jungles to fight for the interests of tin and rubber monopoly capital against the people of Malaya who are fighting for freedom, I wonder what you are thinking? After criticizing the Labor government for leading Britain down the road to war and abandoning socialist policies, the letter sternly warned Shinwell that the Communist Party will resolutely oppose Bevin's anti-Soviet and US imperialist-dependent policies. At the same time, the entire British working class is organizing a series of peace conferences to oppose the war cries emanating from Parliament, newspapers, and radio. Such conferences will be held in many districts of London.

　　英共主席致陆军部长公开信
    反对重整军备计划
    【新华社陕北一日电】电通社伦敦二十五日讯：英共主席加拉彻就工党政府重整军备计划，发表致陆军部长辛威尔的一封公开信称：他从未想到一度曾为战斗社会民主主义者的辛氏，如此容易地为统治阶级所使用。加拉彻告辛威尔称：当你决定派青年人去送死，去到沼泽与丛林中为锡与橡皮垄断资本的利益对为自由而斗争的马来亚人民作战之时，我不知你心中作何感想？该信在批评工党政府领导英国走向战争道路，抛弃社会主义政策之后，正告辛氏说，共产党将坚决反对贝文仇苏与依赖美帝国主义的政策。同时，全英工人阶级组织正组织一系列的和平会议，以反对议会、报纸与广播所发出的战争叫嚣。伦敦许多区中都将召开这种会议。
