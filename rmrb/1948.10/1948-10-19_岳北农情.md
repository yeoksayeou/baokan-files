    【Taiyue Electric】Yuebei Branch reported: Northern Yue experienced a drought during the summer. It wasn't until the end of June that there was a thorough rain. Some areas suffered from hail or strong winds. Since the beginning of autumn, there have been continuous autumn rains, lasting about ten days in various places. As a result, many fields in Qinshui and Anze were washed away (no statistics available). In a large area of 60 *li* from Guodao to the First River in Qinshui, 70-80% of the potatoes in each village became "iron potatoes" (hard and inedible). The crops harvested before the rain in various counties have sprouted a little, but it is not serious. It is estimated that the harvest in the entire Northern Yue area will be good for millet and corn. Qinshui, Qin County, Anze, Tunliu, and Changzi can harvest 90% to 100% of these two crops. Beans generally have about 90% yield, and vegetables are not as good as last year. The sorghum in Changzi, Tunliu, and Qin County had poor yields of only 20-30% due to rain during flowering.

    The work of planting wheat has been led closely from top to bottom. The Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office organized inspection teams to help with the work in various counties. The counties also paid attention to leadership. For example, Anze selected five basic action units to promote wheat planting. Most of the region had sown wheat before the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. The unplanted areas were delayed by the rain. Half of the stubble wheat has been sown. Most areas have plowed the land twice. 7/2 of the areas have plowed three times. Most areas have applied 70-80 *dan* of fertilizer, and the least is about ten *dan*. On average, each *mu* has about 30 *dan* of fertilizer.

    In some places, due to unrealistic ideas of rushing and hurrying, there was an overemphasis on early plowing and early planting. Changzi planted wheat as early as July 15th, and the wheat seedlings are now long enough to be cut. The masses said, "It has grown too vigorously" (meaning the wheat seedlings have grown too lush and have absorbed all the strength and fertilizer from the land). They could freeze to death in winter and not grow well next year. Some areas have plowed and replanted, and some have cut the wheat seedlings to prevent them from developing continuously.

    Insect damage to the roots of stubble wheat has been discovered in Huo County, but the specific insect is unknown. Epidemics and diseases are also very serious in some areas. For example, thirty villages in the fifth district of Qinshui suffered from an epidemic, and twenty-one villages were infected. According to statistics, more than 1,960 people were sick, and 464 died. To solve these problems, the government provided them with a medical loan of 1 million yuan, and also specially organized four doctors to treat them in that area for more than a month. In addition, there is cattle disease in Anze and Changzi. Several villages in a base point in Anze have discovered cattle disease. Wolf attacks are also very serious. On the Hechuan Road between Anze and Jishi, people are scarce in the morning and evening. Three or five people do not dare to move around at sunset.

　　岳北农情
    【太岳电】岳北支社报导：岳北今年伏天旱，至六月底才下透雨，部分地区遭受冰雹或大风。入秋以来又秋雨连绵，各地均在十天左右。因此沁源、安泽被水冲地很多（没有统计）。沁源由郭道至第一川六十里大的地区各村的山药蛋都“铁蛋”（硬的不能吃）了十分之七八。各县雨前割倒的庄稼都生了一些芽，但不要紧。全岳北区收成估计，谷子、玉茭好，沁源、沁县、安泽、屯留、长子这两种庄稼能收九成到十成。豆类普遍约有九成，蔬菜不如去年好。长子、屯留、沁县的高粱因开花时下了雨，瞎了眼，仅有三二成收。种麦工作，从上至下都抓紧了领导。地委专署曾组织检查团帮助各县工作。各县也都注意领导。如安泽选了五个基动，推动种麦工作。全区在旧历中秋节都已大部下种。未种上的也是下雨耽误。改茬麦下种的已有一半。普遍犁过两遍。犁三遍的有七分之二。上粪多的有七八十担，最少的十来担。平均每亩上粪三十担左右。有些地方由于有脱离实际的抢先赶快思想，过分强调早犁早种。长子七月十五就种麦，种的太早，麦苗现在长的就能割了。群众说：“长脱稍了”（即麦苗长的太旺，把地的劲、肥料的劲都吸收光了）。冬天能冻死，明年长不好，现在有的犁了重种，有的把麦苗割了，不使他一直发展。霍县改茬麦发现虫吃根，找不到是什么虫。瘟疫病害，有些地区也很严重。如沁源五区有三十个村受瘟疫，传染的有二十一村。据统计，病了的有一千九百六十多人，病死的四百六十四人。为解决这些问题，政府贷给他们一百万元医药贷款，还专门组织了四个医生，在那一带治了一个多月。另外安泽、长子均有牛病。安泽一个基点就有好几个村发现牛病。狼害也很严重。安泽和川、冀氏这一道河路上，早晚路断人稀。三五人都不敢在日落时行动。
