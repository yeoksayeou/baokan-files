　　A Branch of the Army Hospital Should Not Waste Civilian Labor
    I have a suggestion: A certain branch of the Army Hospital requisitioned more than twenty carts to transport grain to Guantao city. The carts arrived on the morning of the 15th, but for some reason, they were not loaded until dark. The twenty-odd carts waited blankly outside the west gate for an entire day. Now is the busy season for autumn harvests, and the people's time and labor are very precious. Calculating the delay of twenty-odd carts for one day, it wasted more than forty man-days and forty animal-days, resulting in a considerable loss to production. I hope that in the future, all units will be more cautious and cherish the use of civilian labor. Whether requisitioning grain or firewood, they must first complete the procedures so that the carts can be loaded upon arrival, ensuring the task can be completed smoothly and preventing the waste of civilian labor.

### 陆军医院某分院不该浪费民力

　　陆军医院某分院不该浪费民力
    我有一个建议：陆军医院某分院，为了运粮拨了二十余辆大车，到馆陶城内装粮食，十五日早晨车就来到，不知为啥，一直等到天黑还未装车。二十余辆大车就这样在西门外整整白等了一天。现在正是秋忙时节，老百姓的时间劳力都非常宝贵，按二十余辆大车耽误一天计算，就浪费了四十余个人工和四十余头畜工，对生产损失不少。希望今后各单位对动用民力上要慎重爱惜，无论拨粮拨柴，均须首先将手续弄好，车到就装，使任务能顺利完成，也不致浪费民力。
