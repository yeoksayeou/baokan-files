　　The People Are Immortal
　　Wen Miao, Wang Pei
　　Under the repeated seesaw battles and "mopping-up" operations of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, the broad masses of people in the Henan region, in order to protect their own lives and property, rose up to fight the enemy and created many moving model deeds. They (both men and women) not only wielded weapons to kill and wound a large number of enemies, but also used courageous and resourceful methods to carry out cover work.

　　The Mother of People's Fighters
　　Last autumn, just as the wounded soldiers of our East China Field Army were being transported to the areas of Shanxian, Yutai, and Junan, large groups of enemies from Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army and others arrived. The women's association chairman of ××× village in Shanxian County personally sheltered three wounded soldiers. Later, there were enemies everywhere, so she took the wounded soldiers to the fields one by one. She patiently cooked for the wounded soldiers, sending food to the fields seven times a day. At this time, most of the villagers had been beaten and driven away by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits; but she did not run. She thought—I am the only one left; if I leave, several wounded soldiers will die of thirst and hunger, I can't run anymore. She persisted in the village, using various methods to secretly visit the wounded soldiers, asking them kindly and earnestly if they were thirsty or hungry, comforting them, and telling them about the situation. This May, when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits passed through Waiqilou in Huangdui District, Shanxian County, most of the people in the village ran away, but two wounded soldiers were still lying on the Zhuangtou. As the enemies were approaching them, a women's association group leader and two women members saw them. It was too late to move the wounded soldiers, so they each grabbed a handful of grass and covered the wounded soldiers, telling them: "The enemies are coming, don't move, it's okay." After the enemies passed, they carried the wounded soldiers to their own homes, cooked soup and fed them, allowing the wounded soldiers to overcome danger in the most dangerous time.

　　Eggs and Water Bottles
　　This spring, Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army was stationed in villages such as ×× Zhuang and × Lou in Yutai County. The cadres working in these villages could not operate outside during the day, so they entered the tunnels and came out at night to operate outside the villages, attacking and disrupting the enemy. Their meals had become a problem: if they sent food, they would expose their target; if they didn't send food, the cadres would not be able to persist. Finally, the masses came up with a solution: they cooked the eggs they had hidden and put boiling water in glass bottles, and stuffed them into the tunnels through the air holes for their cadres.

　　County Magistrate Who Cares About the People
　　This April, Comrade Kang Wenhui, the county magistrate of the Yutai democratic government, and Comrade Chen Jianwu, the county secretary, relied on the tunnels to lead the districts in persisting in attacking the enemy in the hinterland, and to carry out disaster relief for the masses. One day, as soon as the enemies came, they dug up their tunnels, which made the villagers anxious. Some old men who hadn't run away were beaten and ran out of their homes, confusing the enemies by saying, "Generals, no one has been hiding here. Cadres are hiding in the cave behind the village. We'll lead you to dig them out." The enemies fell for it, and they led the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to dig open several caves where people had been hidden earlier, and then pretended to be suspicious, saying, "How come? I saw people crawling in here yesterday!" They dealt with the enemies in this way, allowing Comrades Kang and Chen to escape safely. Although they escaped this time, it wasn't long before news spread from somewhere that "County Magistrate Kang was killed by the enemies!" When the people heard this unfortunate news, some secretly shed tears. Some old men said, "Our county magistrate died for us, we can't let his body be exposed to the wind and sun!" So everyone carried a coffin and searched everywhere in the wilderness, saying, "No matter what, we have to find the county magistrate and bury him." Later, everyone heard a joyful piece of news: the county magistrate was not dead, and someone saw him at night, so everyone stopped searching. In addition, in Liu Jingchun's family's cave in × Ji, twelve of our cadres had just returned from work and crawled into the cave when the enemies entered the courtyard. The enemies grabbed Liu Jingchun's father and interrogated him severely, but Liu's father didn't say a word. Later, the enemies found the entrance to the tunnel. When Liu's father saw that the cadres were about to be dug out, he calmly said, "I dug this tunnel a long time ago to hide things. If you dig out people, kill my whole family!" The enemies believed him and did not continue digging. Liu's father used the lives of his whole family as a guarantee to save our twelve cadres. Afterwards, Grandpa Liu said: "We are old, it doesn't matter if we die, as long as the cadres are alive, they can avenge us."

　　"Even if you beat me to death, I won't give it to you"
　　In April and May of this year, in × Miao Village, Shijun District, Qibin County, a unit of the plainclothes team of the Chiang Kai-shek 428th Regiment, after discovering that this village had preserved a large amount of public grain, suddenly surrounded the village on × day, deceiving them by saying that they were going to "hold a meeting", and gathered all the men, women, old and young in the village, a total of more than 150 people, in one field. After gathering, a bandit company commander named Hu made a ferocious face and threatened: "The tobacco seller of × Tang in the south was beaten to death by me for not reporting public grain. You are preserving the Eighth Route Army's public grain, you have to report it!" None of the masses agreed. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits saw that it was ineffective, they called over three squads: "One squad pull one person out to beat. If you don't beat out the public grain, I'll take your head!" Each of the bandit soldiers took a thick stick and first pulled out three people to beat: Lu Shangbin, 55 years old, and Lu Jicang, both received more than 200 blows; Lu Ji'en was beaten so badly that he still couldn't move after the wheat harvest. But the answers were consistent: "The People's Liberation Army took the public grain." When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits saw that these three had not been beaten out of the public grain, they pulled the entire village out and started beating them. Lu Yuqing, 55 years old, said: "Even if you beat me to death, I won't give you a single grain of public grain." He was beaten to death and then came back to life. The enemies beat him again, beating him to death and back to life three times. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits said: "I have to beat this old man to death!" "Even if you beat me to death, I won't give it to you." Lu Yuqing shouted angrily. An old man of 61 was almost smashed to pieces by the bandit company commander with a gun barrel, but he stubbornly said: "It doesn't matter if I die!" The bandit company commander had no choice but to say: "This is an old Eighth Route Army, he's not telling the truth." An old woman named Lu, who was eighty-two years old, was beaten unconscious by the enemies with more than ten sticks. The old lady only said: "I'm deaf, I don't know." Lu Xinde's family was beaten so badly that their whole bodies turned black, but they didn't report a single grain of public grain. When the enemies asked a twelve-year-old child named Xiao Jiang where the public grain was, he only said: "I don't know." "If you don't know, I'll bury you!" The bandit soldiers buried him in a soil well, but he still didn't say anything. Liu Lin, fourteen years old, had his neck pressed by the enemies with a bayonet, but they couldn't get a single word out of him.

　　"I just won't give it to you"
　　Li Yongfang, the village chief of ××× Zhuang, was unfortunately captured. The enemies first wanted him to report the guns. When they couldn't get a confession out of him, they shot five people to intimidate him: "If you don't tell me, I'll shoot you right away!" When intimidation didn't work, they hung him on a tree and beat him. They took him to the pseudo-county government and asked again: "Do you have any guns?" Village Chief Li was furious and shouted loudly: "The guns belong to the People's Liberation Army, I just won't give it to you." And he sent a message to his son, calling on him to join the People's Liberation Army to avenge him. Village Chief Li died a glorious death.

　　人民是不朽的
    文渺·王沛
    在蒋匪军的反复拉锯与清剿扫荡下，我河南地区广大人民为保护自己的身家性命，愤起与敌搏斗，创造了许多可歌可泣的模范事迹。他们（与她们）不但手执武器大量杀伤了敌人，且以英勇机智的方法进行了掩护工作。
    人民战士的母亲
    去年秋天，我华野的伤员刚运到单虞、城武、钜南一带，蒋匪五军等大股敌人就来到了。单虞县×××村的妇会长，她自己掩护三个伤员。后来到处是敌人，她就一个一个的把伤员带到地里。她耐心的给伤员做饭，一天往地里送七趟。这时村里人被蒋匪打得大部分都跑开了；她却不跑。她想——就我这一个人了，我走了，好几个伤员要渴死饿死，我不能再跑啦。她在村里坚持，用各种办法偷着一趟趟的到伤员跟前看望，和蔼与殷恳的向伤员问渴问饿，安慰伤员，告诉伤员情况。今年五月间蒋匪从单县黄堆区外齐楼经过，村里的人们大部跑光了，但庄头上还躺着两个伤员。敌人正向他们走来，被一个妇会小组长和两个妇女会员看见，想把伤员运走是来不及啦，她们就每人抱了一抱草盖在伤员的身上，告诉伤员说：“敌人来啦，别动，不要紧。”敌人过去了，她们把伤员抬到自己的家里，给伤员烧汤喂饭，使伤员在最危险的时候渡过了危险。
    鸡蛋和水瓶
    今年春天，城武县××庄、×楼等村住上了蒋匪五军，在该村工作的干部白天无法在外边活动了，便进入地道里，夜间出来到村外活动，打击扰乱敌人。他们吃饭已经成了问题：送饭吧，就要暴露目标；不送饭吧，干部是没法坚持的。最后群众想出了办法，把自己藏着的鸡蛋煮熟，把开水放进玻璃瓶里，从地道的气眼里塞给了自己的干部。
    关心人民的县长
    今春四月，城武民主政府县长康文惠同志与县书陈健吾同志依靠地道领导各区坚持腹地打击敌人，并对群众进行救灾。一天，敌人一来就扒他们的地道，把那村的群众急坏了。一些没跑的老头子破上挨打跑出家来，他们迷惑敌人说：“老总，这里没藏过人，庄后边地洞里藏着干部，俺领您扒去。”敌人上当了，他们领着蒋匪扒开了几个早先藏过人的洞，又伪装怀疑的说：“这是怎的，昨天还见往里钻人呢！”他们这样应付着敌人，使康陈二同志安全脱险。这次他们虽然躲移了，但不久不知从哪里又传出个消息，说“康县长被敌人打死啦！”老百姓听到这个不幸的消息后，有的暗地掉眼泪。有些老头们说：“咱的县长为咱死啦，咱不能让他的尸体被风吹日晒着！”大家便抬着棺材到野地里四处寻找，他们说：“不管怎样也得把县长找着掩埋起来。”后来大家又听到了一个喜悦的消息：县长没死，夜里有人见他，大家才不找了。另外，×集刘景春家的地洞里，有我十二个干部刚工作回来钻进地道，敌人就进院了。敌人抓住刘景春的父亲，严刑审问，刘父一字不说。后来敌人把地道口找着了，刘父一看要把干部扒出来啦，便镇定的说：“这地洞是我早挖了藏东西的，您要找出人来杀我全家！”敌人相信了，没有继续再扒。刘父以全家的生命作保，救出了我十二个干部。事后刘大爷说：“咱老啦，死了没有啥，只要干部活着就能给咱报仇。”
    “打死也没有”
    今年四五月间，在齐滨县石钧区×庙村，蒋匪四二八团便衣队一部，发觉这村保存大批公粮后，于×日突然包围该村，欺骗说要“开会”，将全村男女老少一人不留的集合在一个场里，共一百五十余人。集合后，一胡姓之匪连长做出狰狞的鬼脸进行威胁：“南边×堂卖烟的因不报公粮就是我打死的，你保存八路公粮可得报啊！”群众无一答应。蒋匪一看无效，便叫过了三个班：“一班拉一个去打，打不出公粮来要你的脑袋！”匪兵每人拿着粗棍，先拉出三个群众去打：五十五岁的鹿上宾、鹿继仓，都挨了二百多棍；鹿继恩被打得直到麦后还不能动。但回答都是一致的：“有公粮解放军拉走了。”蒋匪看这三个没有打出公粮，便把全村群众拉开打起来了。五十五岁的鹿玉青说：“你打死我也不给你一粒公粮。”他被打死又还过气来，敌人再打，打得死去活来三次。蒋匪说：“非打死你这老头不可！”“打死也没有。”鹿玉青怒气冲冲的喊。一个六十一岁的老大爷被匪连长用枪筒子浑身几乎捣烂，但他却倔强的说：“我死了也没啥！”匪连长没法，只好说：“这是老八路，不说实话。”八十二岁的鹿大娘十来棍被敌人打迷糊了，老太太只说：“我聋，不知道。”鹿心德家被打得浑身发黑，没有报出一粒公粮。十二岁的儿童小江，敌人向他问公粮在哪里，他只说：“不知道。”“不知道就埋了你！”匪兵把他埋在土井里，他还是不说。十四岁的刘林，敌人用刺刀压着他的脖子，没问出一句话来。
    “就是不给你”
    ×××庄的村长李永芳，不幸被俘。敌人先要他报枪，没问出口供，又毙了五个群众来威吓他：“你不说马上就枪毙你！”威吓不成，又吊在树上打，把他带到伪县府，又追问：“有枪没有？”李村长大怒，厉声高叫：“有枪是解放军的，我就是不给你”。并捎信叫他儿子参加解放军给他报仇。李村长光荣牺牲了。
