Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Marshall visited Athens from the 16th to the 18th of this month, admitting upon his departure that "the situation is serious." The Greek reactionaries, like the Chinese reactionaries, are conducting a civil war with the full support of US imperialism, and are similarly encountering severe military defeats and political and economic crises, which are causing the same distress to US imperialism. In Athens, Marshall held talks with puppet Prime Minister Sophoulis, US Ambassador to Greece Grady, and US Military Mission Chief Van Fleet. Kokkalis, the Minister of Health and Education of the Free Greek Government, recently pointed out in Bucharest that "Marshall's visit to Athens marks the culmination of the economic, political, and military crisis of the royalist fascists." Greece is the area where US imperialism is implementing its so-called "Truman Doctrine," which has already met with shameful failure. In the fiscal year of 1948, ending June 30th of this year, the United States has already supplied the Athens reactionaries with $159 million worth of war materials, and has 5,000 US troops stationed in Greece. The royalist fascist army is commanded by US officers down to the company level. In addition, 5,000 Americans occupy key positions in the political and economic organs of the Athens puppet government, or act as spies, completely controlling the state apparatus of the Athens puppet regime. But all this is in vain. After the disastrous defeat of the royalist fascist army in the Battle of Grammos Mountain this summer, they recently launched an attack on the democratic army in the Vitsi area, suffering heavy losses again. The strength of the democratic army is growing stronger day by day, and they are intensifying their attacks everywhere. The already low morale of the royalist fascist army is further declining. Soldiers and officers are generally war-weary. In early September alone, 66 officers were imprisoned in concentration camps for war-weariness, and some officers were executed. US officers are at a loss and angry about this. One of them admitted that the vast majority of officers and soldiers in the Greek fascist army "are only fighting because Athens orders them to, they do not hate their enemies (referring to the democratic army)."

The Greek people expressed great contempt for Marshall's activities. The Free Greek Radio Station issued a statement saying: "The Greek people consider Marshall to be the executioner who is slaughtering them. The Greek people's will to fight for freedom, independence, and prosperity will once again thwart all the evil plans formulated by Marshall and his Athens lackeys."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Under the military intervention and economic plunder of the US and British imperialists, the economy of the Greek reactionary government's controlled areas has been bankrupted. TASS reports: Greek agricultural production has fallen to 50% of pre-war levels, industrial production has fallen to below 30% of pre-war levels, and 70% of workers are unemployed. The tobacco market in Germany and Austria, which Greece used to have, has been seized by the United States. Now, Greece has 40 million kilograms of tobacco rotting in warehouses, causing 60,000 tobacco industry workers to lose their jobs. At the same time, the domestic market is flooded with American goods. Americans not only seize markets and destroy industries, but also plunder large quantities of agricultural products such as grain, olives, and grapes, causing the Greek people to suffer from hunger. In the Peloponnese Peninsula alone, 500,000 workers are unemployed and 600,000 farmers are homeless. Due to the deterioration of the lives of the working people, the strike movement in the royalist fascist-occupied areas is increasing, and the resistance movement is stronger than ever. Guerrillas recently distributed pamphlets in the Peloponnese Peninsula saying: Civil war, death, heavy taxes, inflation, black markets, poverty, and hunger, this is what American "aid" and the Marshall Plan have brought us. The Marshall Plan means economic enslavement and civil war. Arm yourselves, drive out the American aggressors and their lackeys!

　　希腊伪政府危机日深马歇尔仓皇访问雅典
  　希人民蔑视马歇尔活动决心驱逐美帝及其走狗
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】马歇尔在本月十六日至十八日访问雅典，离开该地时承认“局势严重”。希腊反动派和中国反动派同样在美帝国主义全力支持下进行着内战，同样遭遇严重的军事失败和政治经济危机，因此也同样引起美帝国主义的苦恼。马歇尔在雅典曾与伪总理索福利斯、美驻希大使格拉第、美军事代表团团长范·佛利特会谈。自由希腊政府卫生及教育部长科卡利斯最近在罗京布加勒斯特指出：“马歇尔访问雅典，标志着保皇法西斯经济、政治和军事危机已达极点。”希腊是美帝国主义实施其早已遭到可耻失败的所谓“杜鲁门主义”的区域，美国在至今年六月三十日为止的一九四八年会计年度中，已供给雅典反动派一亿五千九百万美元的作战物资，并有美军五千人驻在希腊，保皇法西斯军直到营的一级都由美军官指挥。此外还有五千美国人霸占雅典傀儡政府各政治、经济机关要职，或充作特务，完全控制雅典伪政权的国家机构。但这一切均属徒劳。保皇法西斯军在今夏格拉姆斯山战役的惨重失败后，最近向维齐地区的民主军进攻，又遭严重损失。民主军的力量则日益强大，现正在各地加紧进攻。保皇法西斯军本已低落的士气，更形低落。官兵普遍厌战，仅九月初即有军官六十六人因厌战被关入集中营，并有若干军官被处死。美国军官对此皆感不知所措和恼怒，他们中有一个人承认希腊法西斯军中的广大官兵“只是因为雅典命令他们才作战，他们并不恨他们的敌人（指民主军）。”
    希腊人民对马歇尔的活动表示极大的轻蔑。自由希腊广播电台发表声明说：“希腊人民认为马歇尔是屠杀他们的刽子手。希腊人民争取自由、独立、繁荣的意志，将再度挫败马歇尔及其雅典奴才所制定的一切邪恶计划。”
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】在美英帝国主义者军事干涉和经济掠夺下，希腊反动政府统治区的经济已陷于破产。塔斯社讯：希腊的农业生产已降为战前水平的百分之五十，工业生产降低到战前水平的百分之三十以下，有百分之七十的工人失业。从前希腊在德奥两国的烟草市场已为美国所攫夺，现在希腊正有四千万公斤的烟草在仓库中任其腐烂，六万烟草工业的工人因此失业，同时国内市场也为美货所泛滥。美国人不仅侵占市场，摧残工业，而且还掠夺大量的粮食、橄榄和葡萄等农产品，使希腊人民陷于饥饿。仅摩里亚半岛一地，就有五十万工人失业，六十万农民无家可归。由于劳动人民生活的恶化，保皇法西斯占领区的罢工运动日益增强，抵抗运动也比以前任何时候都强大。游击队最近在摩里亚半岛散发小册子说：内战、死亡、重税、通货膨胀、黑市、贫困和饥饿，这就是美“授”和马歇尔计划所带给我们的。马歇尔计划就意味着经济奴役和内战。全体武装起来，驱逐美国侵略者和它的走狗！
