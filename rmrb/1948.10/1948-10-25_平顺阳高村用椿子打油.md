　　【Taihang News】Yanggao Village in the fourth district of Pingshun is a village with a relatively good production base in the fourth district. The cadres lead the masses in production relatively deeply. In recent years, due to drought, very few oil crops have been planted, and various oil prices have soared. This year, the Chinese toon trees are bearing very dense seeds, and the cadres immediately organized the picking of the seeds to prevent them from being blown away by the wind. Through such organization and mobilization, the entire village picked a total of twenty-eight shi and five dou of Chinese toon seeds in ten days. The Hou Shouzhou group picked six shi and five dou, and Lei Taihua alone picked one shi and six dou. There were nine households who picked more than one shi. Each shi of seeds can produce thirty jin of oil, for a total of eight hundred and forty jin of oil. Calculated at two thousand yuan per jin of oil, it can be sold for one million six hundred and eighty thousand yuan. At the market price of four hundred yuan per jin of rice, a total of four thousand two hundred jin of rice can be bought. This is a very large income. Ren Fawang said: "Picking Chinese toon seeds this year is really making a fortune. I picked one shi of Chinese toon seeds this year, which is better than planting one mu of land."

　　平顺阳高村用椿子打油
    【太行讯】平顺四区阳高村，是四区生产基础较好的一个村，干部领导群众生产比较深入，这几年因天旱油子种的很少，各种油价高涨。今年的椿树子结的很稠，干部即组织扒椿子，不要叫风刮落了。经这样的组织发动，在十天内，全村共扒椿子二十八石五斗，侯瘦州组一组扒了六石五斗，雷太华一人扒了一石六斗，打子在一石以上的就有九户，每石子能打油三十斤，共能打油八百四十斤。每斤油按二千元计，能卖洋一百六十八万元，按市价买米四百元一斤，共计能买米四千二百斤，这是个很大收入。任发旺说：“今年扒椿子真发财，我今年打了一石椿子，比我种一亩地还强。”（有生、希＠）
