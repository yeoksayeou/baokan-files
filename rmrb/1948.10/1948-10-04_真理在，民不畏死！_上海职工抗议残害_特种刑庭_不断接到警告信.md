Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: A compilation of reports: Shanghai workers and civil servants are sternly protesting against the Kuomintang government's fascist "Special Criminal Court" for persecuting Shanghai workers and staff. According to a Central News Agency dispatch: The Kuomintang Shanghai and Central "Special Criminal Courts" on June 29th and September 23rd respectively, used the shameless excuse of so-called "sabotaging machinery and attempting to create a terror situation" to sentence Wang Xiaohe, an employee of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, to death and executed him by shooting on the 30th. Workers Wu Guozhen and five others were sentenced to life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment respectively. According to a United Press dispatch on the 25th: The Shanghai underground workers' movement issued pamphlets to protest the Kuomintang government's killing of workers and staff. Furthermore, according to a Shanghai Ta Kung Pao report on August 12th: After the sentencing by the Shanghai "Special Criminal Court," on August 11th, seventy-eight civil servants jointly submitted a letter to the court to express their protest, stating: "If truth exists, then the people fear not death. If the people fear not death, then killing one person will cause a hundred to rise up; killing a hundred will cause tens of millions to rise up. Those who kill will ultimately taste the terror of death and will hardly escape the fate of history. The likes of Hitler and Mussolini can serve as a warning." The newspaper also stated: Since the establishment of the Shanghai "Special Criminal Court," it has continuously received such warning letters. The court president alone has received more than two hundred letters. Other personnel also often receive them, and some people call to warn them.

    “特种刑庭”不断接到警告信
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合各方消息：上海工人及公务员严正抗议国民党政府的法西斯“特种刑庭”残害上海职工。据中央社电讯：国民党上海及中央“特种刑庭”先后于六月二十九日及九月二十三日，以所谓“破坏机器，图造成恐怖局面”的无耻借口。将上海电力公司职员王孝和判处死刑并已于三十日枪杀，工人吴国桢等六人分别判处无期及有期徒刑。据二十五日合众社电讯报导：上海秘密工会对国民党政府如此残杀职工，散发小册子提出抗议。又据八月十二日上海大公报披露：在上海“特种刑庭”判刑后，八月十一日即有七十八个公务员联合投书于该刑庭表示抗议，内称：“若真理在，则人民不畏死，人民既不畏死，而杀一人必有百人起；杀百人必有千万人起。杀人者终必尝死之恐怖，且难逃历史之命运，此希、墨之流可为借镜也。”该报并称：上海“特种刑庭”成立以来，不断接到此类警告信件，该庭庭长一人即接到二百余封。其他人员也常接到，并有人打电话警告他们。
