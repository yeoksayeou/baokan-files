　　Yuci New District Concludes Land Redistribution, Farmers Excitedly Rush to Plant Winter Wheat
　　[Jinzhong Electric] After Yuci New District abolished the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system, the work of redistributing rations and autumn seedlings based on the principle of "whoever plants, harvests, plus adjustment" concluded on September 23rd. According to statistics from 120 natural villages, more than half of the autumn seedlings, which totaled 17,557 mu, previously belonged to the Yan Xishan bandit army and were transferred to those who had no land or lost land and had no rations after the "integration of soldiers." A total of 853 households contributed grain, accounting for 8.1% of the total number of households; 3,815 households received grain, accounting for 36.4% of the total number of households. The autumn grain received by the recipient households, plus what they originally had, generally reached 70% of the average. The redistribution of autumn grain has saved nearly 20% of the farmers from starvation and death, greatly boosting their enthusiasm for production. Jia Gengzhu from Deyin Village, who received two shi of grain's worth of autumn seedlings through redistribution and planted five mu of wheat, said excitedly, "I'm so old, I've never experienced anything like this before. I would be letting the Communist Party down if I didn't work hard." An old man from Xishagou, who lived in the enemy area, ran back to the village and asked the Production Committee to redistribute autumn grain to him, saying, "Yan Xishan has made it impossible for us to survive." In order to restore production, production committees have been universally established in various villages. In this movement, some villages, based on the Production Committee, partially replaced bad old cadres. In the Seventh District, 26 cadres were replaced. In leading the redistribution of autumn fields, there were two different methods, leading to two opposite results: One method adhered closely to the mass line, grasping policy principles, leading directly and deeply into the homes of local farmers, understanding the true situation, disseminating policies, connecting with all farmers, and then understanding the thinking of the masses at all levels, promptly convening mass meetings to publicize policies and stabilize people's hearts. Then, a Production Committee was established to study the households needing redistribution and the land-contributing households, convening meetings to explain to them the reasons for redistributing autumn seedlings, and then carefully studying and rationally allocating the redistribution. Most villages in the county followed this method. The other method was characterized by acting as a surrogate, holding narrow poor-peasant views but failing to mobilize poor and hired peasants. For example, in Guojiabao, the problem could have been solved by using military fields and the land of traitors and bullies, but the working cadres, citing "popular demand," also mobilized 14 households. Later, seeing that the "masses" still had "demands," they added another five households in the second round. As the scope of extraction widened, the interests of middle peasants were harmed, affecting their enthusiasm for production. Because of the failure to mobilize the masses, bad people infiltrated the Production Committee in some villages and caused trouble. For example, in Wangdu Village, bad people took control of the Production Committee. Originally, only four households needed to be mobilized, but they mobilized six households and threatened the middle peasants. In two other villages, the number of land-contributing households reached 15%. There were even cadres who were disorganized, undisciplined, and acted recklessly. For example, Cao ×× from the Eighth District, while working in Dongxi Fu Village, where there was no need for redistribution, was tasked by the district committee to investigate the situation there, with redistribution only to be carried out with the approval of the district committee if there were targets. However, Comrade Cao disregarded the decision of the district committee and took 22 mu of autumn seedlings from one household in Jinjiagou (an attached village), claiming they were "traitors and bullies." The county committee has already sent people to correct this problem. After the distribution of autumn seedlings in Dongyang Village, no one attended the subsequent meeting. The land-contributing households were dissatisfied, and the grain-receiving households also felt it was unfair and unreasonable. In the Eighth District, the production committees in several villages were all composed of poor peasants, and the middle peasants were unsympathetic, while the poor peasants were also isolated. These shortcomings are being addressed.

　　榆次新区调青结束农民兴奋赶种宿麦
    【晋中电】榆次新区废除“兵农合一”后，在谁种谁收外加调剂的原则下，调剂口粮秋苗的工作，已于九月二十三日结束。据一二零个自然村统计，一万七千五百五十七亩秋苗内，有一半以上的阎匪军田，转入“兵合”后无地失地没有口粮者手中。出粮户共八五三户，占总户数的百分之八点一；得粮户三千八百一十五户，占总户数的百分之三十六点四。得粮户所得之秋粮，加上自己原有的，一般达平均数的百分之七十。秋粮的调剂，使将近百分之二十的农民免于饥饿死亡，大大的提高了生产情绪。德音村贾更柱调剂到两石粮食的秋苗，种了五亩麦子，他兴奋地说：“我年纪这么大，没过过这么一次，不好好劳动对不起共产党。”西沙沟一个住在敌区的老汉，跑回村里向生委会要求给他调剂秋粮，他说：“阎锡山把咱治的没活路了”。为恢复生产，各村普遍建立了生产委员会，在这个运动中，有的村以生委会为基础，部分的改换了坏的旧干部，七区改换了二十六个。在调剂秋田的领导中，有两种不同的方法，两种相反的结果：一种是群众路线的紧紧的掌握政策原则，领导直接深入到当地农民的家中，了解真实情况，传播政策，串通所有农民，进而了解各阶层群众的思想，及时的召开群众大会，宣传政策安定人心。然后成立生委会，研究需要调剂的户及出地户，召开会议，向他们解释调剂秋苗的原因，再仔细研究，合理分配调剂。全县多数村是这样作的。另一种是包办代替狭隘的贫雇观点但又不去发动贫雇农的作法。如郭家堡用军田与奸霸的土地，便可以解决问题，但工作干部借口“群众要求”，又动了十四户。之后又看到“群众”仍有“要求”，二次又增加了五户，抽的面大了，伤害中农利益，影响了生产情绪。由于不去发动群众，致有的村子坏人钻进生产委员会，从中作祟。如王杜村坏人掌握了生委会，本来动四户即可，但他们动了六户，且威胁中农。还有两村出地户竟达到了百分之十五。更有无组织无纪律胡作妄为的干部，如八区曹××在东西辅村工作，该地本无调剂对象，区委交付的任务是到该地去调查，有对象时经区委批准才能调剂；但该曹同志对区委的决定竟置之不理，把仅家沟（附村）一户的二十四亩秋苗抽去二十二亩，说是“奸霸”。这问题县委已派人去纠正。东阳村分秋苗后，再开会没人到了，出秋户不满，得粮户也觉得不公平不合理。八区有几个村庄生产委员会全是贫农，中农不同情，贫农也陷于孤立，这些缺点正在设法纠正中。　　（文哲）
