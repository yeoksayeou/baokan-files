　　Fanzhi Cadre Test
    Many Erroneous Understandings Urgently Need to be Studied and Improved
    [North Yue News] The Fanzhi County Party Committee conducted a test on cadres present at a cadre meeting held on September 15th. The participants included 56 cadres from county-level departments and 49 cadres from district-level (including district committee). The test results showed that 80 people failed, only 25 passed, and one person got a perfect score. Several problems were discovered in the test: 1. Extremely vague understanding of our Party's general line and general policy in the current historical stage: Only three comrades answered this question completely correctly. The rest answered the general line as "poor and lower-middle peasant line", "mass line", "people's line", "middle peasant line", "democratic politics, democratic policies", "develop production", "solve the problems left over from land reform", "restore agricultural production, unite the majority", "dig out Chiang's roots", "leniency policy", "unite the broad masses to move towards a communist society". Completely unaware of the current nature of the revolution. 2. Not understanding the revolutionary driving force: Some people answered the popular masses as "people from all walks of life, landlords, rich peasants, poor peasants, middle peasants, merchants, workers, and intellectuals". Some said "including party, government, army, and people". 3. Extreme lack of common sense: Among the 105 people, 22 could not answer the five major liberated areas, 53 answered incompletely, and only 30 answered correctly. Regarding the date of birth of the Chinese Communist Party, 17 people did not answer because they did not know, one person said "the day I joined the Party", and 11 people answered incorrectly. Only four people answered correctly how many people there are in the entire liberated area. Some answered "August 1st" as "Xi'an Incident", "Workers' Day", "Labor Day", etc. Some answered Xinhua News Agency as "is a newly changed name of our country", the North China Liberated Area, some answered as "is composed of Jiangsu and Shaanxi", some answered Yugoslavia as a person's name, some answered anarchism as enemy-occupied area, some said Harbin is Chahar, some said Kaifeng is in Suiyuan Province, and Shijiazhuang is in Shanxi Province. Why was the progressive agricultural tax abolished? Some said, the same as peacefully distributing land. (Hao Tongsheng)

　　繁峙干部测验
    很多错误认识亟须学习提高
    【北岳讯】繁峙县委在九月十五日召开的干部会议上，对到会干部进行了一次测验。参加的一百零五人，其中有县级各部门干部五十六人，区级干部（包括区委）四十九人。测验结果，有八十人不及格，只有廿五人及格，其中一人满分。测验中发现几个问题：一、对我党在当前历史阶段的总路线和总政策极端模糊：对这一问题，只有三个同志完全答对。其余则把总路线答成“贫雇农路线”，“群众路线”，“人民路线”，“中贫农路线”，“民主政治，民主政策”，“发展生产”，“解决土改遗留下的问题”，“恢复农业生产，团结大多数”，“挖蒋根”，“宽大政策”，“团结广大群众走向共产主义社会”。对目前革命性质全然不了解。二、不明白革命动力：有的人把人民大众答成“各阶层人士，地主，富农，贫农，中农，商人，工人和知识分子”。有的说“包括党政军民”。三、常识极端缺乏：一百零五人中，有廿二人对五大解放区答不上，有五十三人答的不完全，只有卅人答对的。中国共产党的诞生日期，有十七人因不知没答，有一人说是“我入党的那天”，有十一人答错。全解放区有多少人口，答对的只有四人。有的将“八一”答成“西安事变”，“工人节”，“劳动节”等。有的把新华社答成“是我们新改的一个国名”，华北解放区，有的答成“是江苏和陕西组成的”，有的将南斯拉夫答成一个人名，有的把无政府答成是敌占区，有的说哈尔滨就是察哈尔，有的说开封在绥远省，石家庄在山西省。为什么废除农业累进税呢？有的说，和平分土地一样。（郝同生）
