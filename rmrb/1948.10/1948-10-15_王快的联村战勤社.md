　　Wang Kuai's Joint Village War Support Cooperative
[North Yue News] Wang Kuai Town in Fuping is a major thoroughfare connecting Quyang, Xingtang, Tangxian, and Wutai. Transportation is busy, and people and livestock are often stationed at the transportation station for errands. At times, more than twenty workers and animals arrive, and sometimes they wait a whole day for nothing. It is especially difficult for villages like Jiazanggou and Huanglianyu, more than 30 li away from Wang Kuai, to spend two days on a round trip for one errand. Comrade Zhao Qixiang from the county promotion agency suggested organizing a war support cooperative last winter to solve the problem of villagers' difficulty in running errands at the transportation station. During the land reform in each village, he publicized and discussed the idea with the masses, which was supported by many villages. At the end of February, the county sent Comrades Niu Jixian and Zhang Zhongxiang to assist Zhao Qixiang in handling the matter. They borrowed 1.12 million yuan from the bank to buy four mules and started transportation. At the end of March, they began to solicit shares, stipulating that each unit of labor should contribute 10,000 yuan (equivalent to 3.5 to 4 *shi* of rice at that time). The war support cooperative would handle the logistical duties at the transportation station. The five remote villages of Dongchengpu, Guangcheng, Bangou, Jiazanggou, and Huanglianyu were the focus of shareholding. In mid-April, the transportation station held a meeting of logistics team leaders, explaining the organizational methods of the war support cooperative and its benefits to the masses. The cadres were very enthusiastic and went back to mobilize the people. In Bangou Village, only five or six people were left who had not bought shares. In Guangcheng Village, out of 177 laborers, 44 bought shares; out of 66 animals, 7 bought shares, and others expressed hesitation and did not participate. By the end of April, eleven villages (mostly remote villages, as it was more convenient for villages closer by to provide manpower temporarily) with 700.5 units of labor had contributed over 7 million yuan, and bought another six mules and three carts, bringing the total to ten animals. In addition to the four used for transportation, the remaining six animals and three carts were all used to serve at the station. Villagers who bought shares stopped running errands. The cooperative's method for assigning shares was: a young adult counted as one unit of labor, first-class mules were equivalent to four units of labor, second-class three and a half, third-class three, and donkeys were stipulated as first-class donkeys three units of labor, second-class two and a half, and third-class two. The number of workdays was calculated based on the units of labor.

    From May to mid-August, in three and a half months, the cooperative replaced the masses in serving 15,544 workdays (calculated in *li* and *jin*), equivalent to 22 workdays replaced for each unit of labor. In June, the war support cooperative's manpower accounted for one-third to one-half of the station's total manpower. During the wheat harvest, after the transportation station stopped its duties for ten days, the war support cooperative completely took over the transportation, which greatly facilitated the masses' production. Using carts saved a lot of labor. For example, at the beginning of June, transporting 20,000 *jin* of cotton westward would have required more than 200 animals, but the war support cooperative completed the task with three carts in seven or eight days. In addition to not having to bear logistical duties, each unit of labor received a dividend of 50,000 yuan in three and a half months. Many cooperative members said, "It's a real bargain to invest 10,000 yuan, not have to run errands, and still get dividends." Those who did not buy shares reflected, "We must buy shares next time no matter what." Some even complained that the cadres did not explain it clearly at the time, so they missed the opportunity to buy shares. The masses in remote villages like Jiazanggou and Huanglianyu said, "This is great, now we can focus on production!" However, some people also reflected, "Is it possible that the transportation station is not busy?" "Maybe they're just making those who didn't buy shares do the errands?" The misunderstandings were only eliminated after the number of workdays was announced at the village logistics team leaders' meeting.

    The reasons why the cooperative achieved these results in such a short period of time are: 1. From the beginning, the war support cooperative paid attention to supporting its expenses with various businesses. The businesses included a mule and horse shop, transportation, sales, and investment. A total of 17 people were involved in the operation. In addition to the director, there were five people in the sales department, four in the transportation department (serving and transporting), and seven in the shop management department. In three and a half months, the mule and horse shop not only solved the expenses of people and animals, but also earned 1 million yuan. Transportation and sales earned 4 million yuan, and investment earned 1 million yuan. All personnel, except for two cooks and three animal handlers who earned wages, distributed 30% of the profits as bonuses, and 70% as dividends to shareholders. Doing business well is the main reason for the consolidation of the cooperative. 2. The efforts of cadres and staff greatly saved expenses: cleaning houses and repairing things in the station were mostly done by themselves, without hiring workers. Comrade Niu Jixian of the business department grazed the animals in his spare time, and using carts to transport goods saved even more expenses than using pack mules. 3. The cooperative had a very close relationship with the transportation station. The stationmaster Ma often arranged the timing of cargo transportation and helped with organization, and bank loan assistance also played a significant role. The cooperative is now planning to organize a representative meeting to strengthen the connection between the cooperative and the masses, and to expand its business to attract all the labor force of the eleven villages to participate in the war support cooperative. In addition, a contract transportation system can be adopted for dividend distribution, where shareholders do not receive dividends, which can gradually accumulate capital and better maintain the consolidation of the war support cooperative.

　　王快的联村战勤社
    【北岳讯】阜平王快镇是通曲阳、行唐、唐县、五台的大道，运输繁忙，经常有人和牲口在交通站听差支应，多时听差牲口到达二十余头以上，有时无事则白听一天。尤其距王快卅多里地的贾藏沟、黄连峪等村支一遭差来回得两天，更感困难。县推进社赵其祥同志，去冬提议组织战勤社，解决各村群众在交通站的支差困难。在各村土改时即向群众宣传酝酿，得到不少村庄的赞助。二月底县里派牛继先、张中祥二同志协助赵其祥办理，从银行贷款一百一十二万元，买骡子四头，先跑起运输来。三月底开始号召入股，规定每个动力入股一万元（当时合三市斗半至四市斗米）。交通站上的勤务由战勤社代服。并以东城铺、广城、半沟、贾藏沟、黄连峪等五个远村为入股重点。四月中交通站召开了后勤队长会议，解释了战勤社的组织办法，对群众的好处，干部情绪很高，回去进行动员。半沟村只剩五、六人未入股，广城村一七七个劳动力，入股的四十四个；六十六个牲口，入股的七个，其他人表示犹疑，没有参加。截至四月底，十一个村（大部是远村，因近村出勤较为方便暂不吸收），七○○·五个动力，入股七百万余元，又买骡子六头，大车三辆，连前共十头牲口。除四头作运输外，其余六头牲口，三辆大车，都到站服勤。入股群众交钱后，即停止支差。社员顶股办法是：一个青壮年算一个动力，头等骡子合四个动力，二等三个半，三等三个，驴规定头等驴三个动力，二等二个半，三等二个，出勤工数按动力计算。
    从五月开始至八月中三个半月，代替群众服勤一五五四四个（按里斤计算），合替每个动力负勤二十二个。六月战勤社出勤占全站勤务的三分之一至二分之一。麦收时，交通站停止勤务十天后，完全由战勤社包运，便利了群众的生产。用大车拉节省劳力很大。如六月初向西运棉花两万斤，用牲口得二百多头，战勤社三辆大车，七、八天即运完了。入股群众除不负担勤务外，三个半月内每个动力尚分红利五万元，许多社员都反映说：“入一万元不支差还分红，真便宜。”未入股的则反映：“下次无论如何我们得入股。”更有的抱怨干部当时没有讲明白，使他们没有入上股。贾藏沟、黄连峪等远村的群众说：“这可闹好了，安心生产吧！”但也有的群众反映：“准是交通站不忙吧？”“可能尽叫不入股的出差吧？”在各村后勤队长会议上，将工数公布后，才消除了误会。
    该社在短短的时间内获得这些成绩的原因是：一、战勤社一开始组织，即注意了以各种业务支持开支。业务有骡马大店，运输，运销及投资经营人员共十七人，除主任外，运销股五人，运输股四人（服勤和运输），店务股七人，三个半月中，骡马大店不仅解决了人和牲畜的开支，还赚洋一百万元。运输运销挣四百万元，投资挣一百万元。全体人员除两个做饭的，三个赶牲口的挣工资外，其余人员按百分之三十分红，百分之七十为股东分红。业务做得好，是该社得以巩固的主要原因。二、干部与职员的努力，大大节省了开支：站内收拾房子及修理东西，大部是亲自动手，不雇工人。业务股牛继先同志闲时赶着牲口放，再加用大车拉，比用驮骡节省开支更大。三、和交通站关系十分密切，交通站马站长经常在运货上搭配时间，帮助组织，银行贷款扶助都起作用很大。现在该社正计划组织代表会，以密切社内和群众的联系。并将业务扩大，争取十一个村的动力都参加到战勤社里来。另外在分红上可采用包运制，股东不分红，这样可以逐渐积累资本，更能保持战勤社的巩固。
