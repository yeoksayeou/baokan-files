[Jizhong Electric] Recently, a serious trend of coercion, commandism, and beating people has developed among some county and district cadres in Xian County. Although the county Party committee had conducted education on democratic work style at several county and district cadre meetings held in July and August, and the phenomenon of coercion and commandism had decreased for a period of time, since September, due to insufficient education by the county Party committee, coupled with the failure of some comrades to completely overcome their coercive and commanding work style and anarchist ideas, the phenomenon of beating people occurred during the mobilization of war support. Li Jingchun, chief of the armed forces department of the county, beat a civilian worker in Li Xie Village when mobilizing stretcher bearers because the civilian worker said a few words unwilling to go. In Donglangtun, District Six of the county, because the war support burden had been unreasonable in the past, when mobilizing civilian workers, one person was unwilling to go and was beaten by Shi Fuzhen, the village civil affairs committee member, and handed over to the district brigade. District cadres Su Chunxuan, Geng Fuzhen, and others briefly mobilized him but failed, and then started beating him again until the person reluctantly said he would carry a stretcher. When the district cadres were beating people, Chen Guiwu, the district party secretary, not only did not stop them, but sympathized with them, saying, "Problems cannot be solved without beating." Bai Zifeng, an education assistant in District Seven, beat Wang Huitu, a civilian worker, with a belt when he was late in going to work in Shangjialin Fourth Village. Cui Tieshan, deputy captain of the armed forces department in District Five, has always been coercive and commanding. He beat two people during flood prevention, and recently beat another person for mobilizing war support. From September 20th to October 5th, in half a month, county, district, and village cadres beat nine people. In order to overcome this serious phenomenon, the county party committee held a joint meeting of district secretaries and district heads a few days ago and severely criticized the districts. It pointed out that this bureaucratic and coercive commanding style is an illegal and bad behavior. When mobilizing war support, if the masses cannot understand it for a while, education should be strengthened to explain that supporting the war is the obligation of the people in the liberated areas. Those who truly resist the laws and decrees of the democratic government can be dealt with according to government laws and decrees, but absolutely no one can be beaten. It was also decided that whoever beats someone must personally apologize to them face-to-face and be subject to disciplinary action. The heads of the organs also wrote letters of apology, stating that such violations would not be allowed in the future.

　　献县县委严格批评干部
  　打人恶风要不得
    【冀中电】献县某些县区干部中，近来发展着严重的强迫命令、打人等恶劣作风。该县县委在七、八月间召开的几次县区干部会上，虽然已进行过民主作风的教育，有个时期强迫命令现象已经减少，但九月份以来，因为县委教育不够，再加上某些同志的强迫命令作风及无政府思想未彻底克服，因而在动员战勤中，便发生了打人现象。县武装部股长李景春在李谢村动员担架时，因为一个民工说了几句不愿去的话，李景春就打了民工一顿。该县六区东郎屯因过去战勤负担不合理，动员民工时，一个人不愿去，被村民政委员史福珍打了一顿，又交给区大队部，区干部苏春轩，耿福珍等四人简单的动员了一下不成，又动手打人，直到那个人勉强说了句去抬担架才不打了。当区干部打人时，该区区委书记陈桂五不但不予制止，反倒同情他们，竟说：“不打不能解决问题。”七区教育助理员白子风，在商家林四分村动员民工时，民工王会图去的晚了，白同志便用皮带打他。五区武装部副大队长崔铁山一贯强迫命令，防汛时打过两个人，最近为动员战勤又打了一个人。从九月廿日到十月五日半个月中，县区村干部就打了九个人。为克服这种严重现象，县委在日前召开的区书、区长联席会上，对各区提出严格批评。指出这种官僚主义、强迫命令的作风，是犯法的恶劣行为。在动员战勤时，群众一时搞不通应加强教育，说明支援战争是解放区人民的义务，对真正不法分子抵抗民主政府法令的，可按政府法令处理，绝对不能打人。并决定谁打了人要亲去当面道歉，并应受纪律制裁。机关首长并写信道歉，今后决不容许再犯。
