Is it right to cultivate backbones among primary school teachers based on class background?
    Question: I read your newspaper's August 3rd issue, No. 50, page 2, news item "Jinan Administrative Office Directs Primary Education to Correct Leftist Deviations and Improve Students' Culture." Under the statement "For newly promoted teachers of worker-peasant origin, we must strengthen their professional guidance and cultural learning, establish their prestige among the masses, and gradually make them the backbone of primary school teachers," the editor added a few sentences: "This is wrong. It's a joke to let illiterate poor and lower-middle peasants be the backbone of primary school teachers." After reading this, I took out the original instruction and compared it, and then compared it with the Jinan Daily. The original words of the Jinan Administrative Office are exactly as your newspaper stated, but my understanding of the spirit is somewhat different from what your newspaper discussed.
    In the original instructions of the Jinan Administrative Office, there are the following sentences: "If they are too young or their level is too low, they can be sent to simplified normal schools or organized into short-term teacher training classes to specifically cultivate and improve them." Therefore, my understanding of the spirit is that as long as they can teach, we should strengthen their professional work and strengthen their cultural learning. When their professional work is strengthened and their cultural level is improved, they will naturally establish prestige among the masses. Therefore, the Administrative Office proposed that worker-peasant teachers establish prestige among the masses and then gradually (step by step) become the backbone of primary school teachers. This is not just grabbing a worker-peasant teacher to be a backbone. In order to prevent the lower levels from making deviations, the Administrative Office proposed that worker-peasant teachers who cannot teach well can be sent to simplified normal schools or open training classes to train them separately. This further shows that it is not a purely "worker-peasant line." Moreover, your newspaper clearly publishes the original text, but adds the editor's note. I feel that the editor's note does not contradict the instructions of the Jinan Administrative Office. The editor said, "It is a joke to make illiterate poor and lower-middle peasants the backbone of primary school teachers," but can illiterate poor and lower-middle peasants be teachers? The editor did not mention it. On the contrary, the Jinan Administrative Office clearly stated in its instructions that those with too low a cultural level cannot be teachers. Worker-peasant teachers can only become backbones after their professional skills are strengthened, their culture is improved, and their prestige is established.
    If you say that there should be no distinction between backbone and non-backbone among teachers, the editor can put forward the reason in this regard (because I am vague about this issue). If there must be backbones, I feel that the Administrative Office's instructions are not a joke but a correct working arrangement and steps. I wonder if this is the case. (Shou Ren)

    Answer: The question you raised should be understood in this way: It is not that there cannot be backbones among primary school teachers, but the approach mentioned in the Jinan Administrative Office's instructions: "For newly promoted teachers of worker-peasant origin, we must strengthen their professional guidance and cultural learning, establish their prestige among the masses, and gradually make them the backbone of primary school teachers" is incorrect. Because newly promoted teachers of worker-peasant origin, although they have good class background, mostly have low cultural levels and little teaching experience. They cannot become the backbone of primary school teachers in a certain period of time. The backbone of primary school teachers must first have a certain cultural level, professional ability, be active and responsible in their work, and have close ties with the masses. Class background is a secondary issue. The editor's note added to the instructions of the Jinan Administrative Office is based on this spirit. Naturally, the instructions did not say to let "illiterate poor and lower-middle peasants be backbones," but in the past, there were indeed such erroneous behaviors in the educational work in some places, and the understanding of the Jinan Administrative Office's instructions in this regard was insufficient. Therefore, it still proposed the method of cultivating backbones based on class background. However, the editor's note did not explain it separately at the time, causing readers to have doubts. This should be explained together here.

### 小学教员中根据成份培养骨干对不对？

　　小学教员中根据成份培养骨干对不对？
    问：阅贵报八月三日第五十号第二版“冀南行署指示小学教育纠正左倾偏向提高学生文化”消息内，在“对新提拔起来的工农出身的教员要加强其业务领导与文化学习，在群众中树立其威信，使之逐渐成为小学教员中的骨干”之下编者加了几句“这是错误的，让没有文化不起字的贫雇农作小学教员的骨干是开玩笑”，我看了以后，于是把原来的指示拿出来对了一对，又拿出冀南日报对了一对，冀南行署的原话正如贵报所载，但我领会的精神与贵报所谈有些出入。
    在冀南行署原指示下面有这样几句“如果年龄太小程度太低者可送简师学习或组织短期师资训练班专门培养训练提高他们”。所以我领会的精神只要他能教学就要加强他的业务工作和加强他的文化学习，等他的业务工作加强了文化程度提高了，他自然在群众中树立了威信，因此行署提出叫工农教员在群众中树立起威信再逐渐的（就是一步一步的）成为小学教员的骨干，那就不是随便抓住一个工农教员来当骨干，为了使下级不致出偏向，行署提出又不能勉强教学的工农教员可送简师学校或单独开训练班训练他们。这更是说不是单纯的“工农路线”，况贵报明白登载原文，却又加上了编者批语，我觉着编者批语与冀南行署指示没有什么矛盾，编者说“使没有文化不识字的贫雇农作小学教员骨干是开玩笑”，但是，没有文化不识字的贫雇农能否作教员呢？编者没有提。相反的冀南行署指示内明文指出文化程度太低者不能任教员，叫工农教员当骨干是在他业务加强了文化提高了威信建立之后，才成为可能。
    如果说教员内不能有骨干与非骨干之分，编者可在这方面提出道理来（因为我对这个问题模糊），如果须要有骨干的话我觉着行署指示不是什么开玩笑而是正确的工作布置步骤，不知然否。　　　　　（瘦人）
    答：你提出的问题应该这样认识：小学教员中不是不能有骨干，但冀南行署指示中所提的：“对新提拔起来的工农出身的教员，要加强其业务领导与文化学习，在群众中树立其威信，使之逐渐成为小学教员中的骨干”的作法是不对的。因为新提拔起的工农出身的教员，虽然成份好，但大多文化不高，教学经验不多，他们在一定时间内还不可能成为小学教员中的骨干。小学教员中的骨干，首先必须具有一定文化水平、业务能力而又工作积极负责，与群众有密切联系才行，成份倒是次要问题。编者对冀南行署指示所加按语，即从此精神出发，自然该指示中并没有说让“没有文化不识字的贫雇农作骨干”，但过去确有的地方的教育工作中存在有这种错误行为，而冀南行署指示在这一点上的认识是不够的，因之仍然提出根据成份培养骨干的办法，但当时编者按语未分别解释，致使读者发生疑问，应在此一并说明。
