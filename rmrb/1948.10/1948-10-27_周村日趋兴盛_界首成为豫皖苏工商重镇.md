Xinhua News Agency, East China, 22nd: Zhoucun City, Shandong Province, is experiencing a surge in industry and commerce. The city now has over 3,200 industrial and commercial enterprises, a 42% increase compared to before its liberation this spring. Among these, the city's renowned silk weaving industry has seen the most rapid growth, increasing more than elevenfold. There are currently 296 silk weaving factories with over 500 looms, producing over 600 bolts of silk and satin per day. In contrast, only 25 silk weaving factories were operating when the enemy occupied the city this spring. The number of cotton weaving factories has increased from over 30 before liberation to 106, producing over 600 bolts of cloth per day. Along with the development of the silk and cotton weaving industries, the dyeing and cloth merchant businesses have also increased by one and a half to two times. Other industries such as steel, general merchandise, pharmaceuticals, and warehouses have also seen significant development. With the liberated areas connected and transportation unblocked, many merchants from Shijiazhuang, Weixian, Yanzhou, and Jining come to Zhoucun to purchase goods. According to statistics from mid-June, the daily number of merchants exceeded 3,000. The trading of silk, satin, yarn, and cloth is booming. According to an August survey, the turnover per market day reached approximately 700 million North Sea currency, with approximately 30 million North Sea currency being remitted daily through the North Sea Bank for purchasing goods. The rapid development of industrial production in the city is largely due to the loan assistance provided by the North Sea Bank, which has successively issued industrial loans totaling over 128.7 million yuan, small loans for urban poor totaling 37.39 million yuan, and commercial loans totaling 2.3 million yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 25th: Jieshou City, located in the northwest of Taihe County, Anhui Province (on the border of Henan and Anhui), has seen its industry and commerce gradually move from depression to prosperity after eight months of suppressing bandits, correcting policies, and providing low-interest loans. It has now become a major industrial and commercial town in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu border region. As of August, the city had over 2,500 industrial and commercial households. Various industries have increased compared to before liberation, with the hosiery industry doubling, the shoe manufacturing industry increasing threefold, the printing industry adding five establishments, the blacksmithing industry adding eleven establishments, and the livestock trade adding nine establishments, with over 400 head of livestock regularly brought to market. The city is located on the Ying River. Last winter, there were no boats docked, but currently, over 700 merchant ships are traveling between Fuyang and Yingshang. Land transportation is unblocked to Zhoujiakou and Huaiyang in Henan Province, as well as Boxian and Fuyang in Anhui Province. Compared to March of this year, the number of horse-drawn carts and carriages traveling to and from these areas has increased from a total of 22 to a total of 55. Due to the increasing prosperity of the market, there is a shortage of houses. The municipal government has decided to open a new Zhongyuan Avenue to meet the needs.
