The Military Region People's Armed Forces Department Issues Instructions
Rectify Organizations and Conduct Winter Training

[Our Newspaper Dispatches] The North China Military Region People's Armed Forces Department recently issued instructions regarding the winter work for 1948. The full text is as follows:

Over the past year, the people's armed forces in various regions have exhibited extreme confusion in terms of organization and the ideology of cadres and members. In many areas, the old militia and self-defense force organizations were dissolved or spontaneously disbanded, and they were not restored and rebuilt in a timely manner. Although some areas established new militia organizations under the leadership of peasant associations, they simply emphasized class composition and did not absorb middle peasants, resulting in many experienced and seasoned militia members being excluded from the militia organizations. This created disunity between old and new militia members, and even disunity among the peasants. In many areas, due to unclear procedures for transferring militia weapons or the complete absence of responsible custodians, militia weapons suffered serious damage and waste. In some areas, the leading organs of the people's armed forces at all levels were virtually abolished, and cadres were transferred away, causing a disconnect in leadership from top to bottom, leading to work stagnation and neglect. Many district and village cadres, due to insufficient understanding of the revolutionary situation or being wrongly labeled as "stones," developed various confused phenomena in their thinking, such as negativity, degeneration, fear of death, and demands for reassignment, thus resigning from their posts and returning home, or village cadres simply stopped working; even those who continued to work expressed negativity, slackness, and a fear of taking responsibility. On the other hand, the style of commandism and abuse remained. In the thinking of the members, there was also an extreme manifestation of democratization, disobeying leadership, not following commands, and even resisting leadership, etc.

Due to the above-mentioned chaotic situation, not only has the construction of the people's armed forces suffered serious losses, but it has also directly had a great impact on war, production, and local security. For example, in some areas, the militia was not active in fighting the enemy, guerrilla warfare in border areas was not actively carried out, and even the enemy conducted armed parades in our heartland without being given the necessary blows. Serious desertions occurred when militia and civilian laborers supported the front lines in the war. The burden of service for the masses was unfair and unreasonable, and it was not rectified in a timely manner, causing the masses to resent service, leading many to sell their livestock. Furthermore, bandits and special agents destroyed power lines, robbed pedestrians, and even killed people in various places, organized secret society riots, and could not be suppressed in a timely manner, etc.

Although the leadership of the people's armed forces in various regions has begun to pay attention in the past six months, and preliminary rectification has been carried out, this chaotic situation has improved considerably, and the relationship between the militia and the masses has also made considerable progress. However, due to the heavy central work in various regions and the transfer of cadres, the rectification of the people's armed forces work in various regions has not been well integrated with the overall work. Therefore, in general, only key rectification has been carried out, and only a few areas have carried out relatively widespread preliminary rectification. However, the disorganized state in most areas remains serious. Therefore, the central work this winter should be:

First, integrate with party rectification to conduct comprehensive organizational rectification work.

A. Requirements for organizational rectification: 1. All regions should re-establish and improve the original militia and self-defense force organizations. Areas that have collapsed and not yet been restored should restore the organizations, and areas that have restored the organizations but are not yet consolidated should continue to consolidate the organizations. Border areas and new areas that do not have organizations or have incomplete organizations should establish and develop organizations, improve the organization of various militia and civilian labor task forces, and prepare to vigorously support the front lines. 2. Thoroughly investigate and register militia weapons and ammunition, conduct necessary investigations, ensure that weapons are firmly in the hands of active members of the militia, strengthen the militia's education on guarding and cherishing weapons, establish a system for the custody of weapons, and eliminate all phenomena of damage to weapons and waste of ammunition. 3. Adjust and allocate cadres, improve leadership organs at all levels, establish the idea of building the people's armed forces, and overcome all ideas of belittling the work of the people's armed forces and unwillingness to do the work of the people's armed forces. 4. Rectify the discipline of the militia and self-defense forces and the ideological style of cadres, oppose all negative and lazy work, degeneration, the idea of not wanting to work, and the style of commandism and abuse, as well as the phenomena of extreme democratization, undisciplined and disorganized behavior among cadres and members. 5. Conduct a thorough investigation of manpower and animal power, and rectify war service work. At the same time, summarize the experience of participating in the war and supporting the front lines in order to understand the overall war service work. B. Matters to be noted in the rectification: 1. It is necessary to integrate with the overall party rectification work. The organizational rectification work of the people's armed forces should be carried out on the basis of the reorganization of the party branches in the countryside. The cadres of the people's armed forces should participate in the rural party rectification work. 2. The spirit of party rectification and the democratic movement must be implemented in the organizational rectification. In adjusting cadres and resolving the issue of unity between new and old cadres and militia members, party education must be combined with external democratic review and election. In reorganizing the various task forces of the militia and self-defense forces and rectifying service work, it is necessary to conduct in-depth publicity and education, combined with extensive democratic appraisal. In reviewing and restoring cadres and militia members, the idea of closing the door to middle peasants should be corrected. In resolving the above problems, one should not simply start from reorganizing the people's armed forces organization, but should regard it as part of party rectification and correcting deviations in the implementation of policies. 3. Resolutely cleanse very bad elements from the organization, and absorb active members from the basic masses to participate in the militia. C. Steps and methods of reorganization: 1. The time and steps for organizational rectification. Each region should gradually transfer to the work of reorganizing the people's armed forces in a step-by-step manner within the work sequence stipulated by the district party committee. 2. The method of organizational rectification can generally adopt the method of key leadership driving nearby villages. 3. Improving organization, investigating weapons, rectifying discipline, and rectifying war service should be carried out in a planned and integrated manner.

Second, conduct winter training on the basis of organizational rectification.

A. Requirements: After the organization of the militia and self-defense forces is improved, training should be conducted during the agricultural slack season. The militia and self-defense forces in the heartland should focus on political education and task education to raise their class consciousness in order to consciously carry out tasks and abide by discipline. The content of education includes current events, discipline, tasks, technology, and the military knowledge necessary for participating in war and supporting the front lines, etc. The militia in border areas should focus on both military and political affairs. The content of education includes policies, current events, tactics, and military techniques (shooting, throwing grenades, laying mines, etc.). B. Methods: 1. Before the militia and self-defense forces are trained, instructors should be trained first, or the method of members teaching members can be used. Sufficient preparations should be made in advance, and the class time should not be too long each time. Political education can be combined with winter literacy classes. In border areas, the militia should pay attention to combining with actual combat. 2. In order not to hinder the production of the masses, it should generally be carried out by village unit and not conduct large-scale collective training. However, it can be carried out by district or small district (township) in the form of review, but the time should not exceed one day in principle (bring your own food). 3. The military region or sub-region shall organize cadre training courses in rotation to train district and village cadres and civilian labor cadres who are on the job. The content and time of training shall be planned by the armed forces departments of each secondary military region.

Third, strengthen the leadership of the struggle against the enemy in the border areas.

Take the initiative to actively attack the enemy areas, carry out the explosion movement, and encircle and blockade the enemy. When the enemy harasses, carry out joint defense and counter-attack warfare, resolutely carry out the task of protecting grain and conscripts, and pay attention to combining various struggles and establishing militia organization work. The militia and garrison troops in the heartland, under the leadership and command of the military region or garrison command, automatically maintain治安, but must obey the command and guidance of the public security department. Carry out the winter defense movement and suppress the activities of bandits and special agents in a timely and effective manner. The various districts can make detailed arrangements for the above-mentioned tasks according to the specific conditions of their districts, and report the arrangements and implementation to this department at any time. After the organizational rectification and training are completed, we hope to summarize and report.

　　军区人民武装部发布指示
    整顿组织进行冬训
    【本报讯】华北军区人民武装部顷发布关于一九四八年冬季工作的指示，全文如下：
    过去一年来，各区人民武装在组织上及干部队员思想上，表现出极端混乱的情况。许多地区旧有的民兵、自卫队的组织，被解散或自流的取消，而未能及时恢复再建。有的虽然在贫农团领导下，建立了新的民兵组织，但单纯强调成份，不吸收中农参加，致使不少有战斗经验而老练的民兵，被摈弃在民兵组织之外，形成了新老民兵的不团结，甚至造成农民间的不团结。许多地区由于民兵武器移交手续不清，或根本无人掌握保管，致使民兵武器遭到严重损坏与浪费。有的地区人民武装各级领导机关，无形中取消，干部被调走，致使领导上上下脱节，以致工作停顿无人过问。许多地区的区、村干部，由于对革命形势认识不足，或是被错搬“石头”，而形成了干部思想上消极、蜕化、怕死、要求改行种种混乱现象，于是私自脱职回家，村干部也自动不干；有的纵然继续工作也表示消极怠工、不敢负责任。另一方面强迫命令打骂作风依然存在。在队员思想上，也发生了极端民主化的现象，不服从领导，不听指挥，甚至反抗领导等等。
    由于以上这种混乱的情况，不仅在人民武装的建设上遭受了严重的损失，而对战争、生产、地方治安也直接发生了极大的影响。如有的地区民兵对敌斗争不积极，边沿区游击战开展不活跃，甚至敌人在我腹心地区武装游行，而不能给以必要的打击。民兵民工支前参战时发生严重逃亡。群众负担勤务不公平，不合理，得不到及时整顿，而使群众厌烦负勤，为此卖掉牲口者不少。以及各地发生匪特破坏电线抢劫行人，甚至杀人，组织会门暴动，而不能即时给以镇压等等。
    虽然，半年来各地区对人民武装的领导，已开始注意，已经进行了初步整理，这种混乱情况已有了不少的改善，民兵与群众的关系亦有不少进步。但终因各地中心工作繁重，干部调动，各地人民武装工作的整理，未能与整个工作很好结合，故一般的只做了重点整理，个别地区做了较普遍的初步整理。但大部地区混乱无组织的状态，仍是严重的。因此今冬的中心工作应该是：
    第一、结合整党进行全面的整顿组织工作
    甲、对整顿组织的要求：一、各地区应根据原有民兵自卫队的组织形式，重新健全起来，已经垮台尚无恢复的地区，要恢复组织，已经恢复组织而尚不巩固的地区，要继续巩固组织。边沿地区及新区，没有组织或组织不健全者，要建立组织发展组织，健全民兵民工各种任务队的编制，准备大力支前。二、彻底清查登记民兵武器弹药，并进行必要的调查，武器要确实掌握在民兵中的积极分子手里，加强民兵保管爱护武器的教育，建立保管武器的制度，消灭一切损坏武器浪费弹药的现象。三、调整与配备干部，健全各级领导机构，树立建设人民武装的思想，克服一切轻视人民武装工作，不愿做人民武装工作的思想。四、整顿民兵自卫队纪律，及干部思想作风，反对一切消极怠工、蜕化、不干思想与强迫命令打骂作风，及干部队员极端民主化无纪律无组织的现象。五、要切实清查人畜动力，整顿战勤工作。同时还应总结参战支前经验以便了解全面战勤工作。乙、整顿中应注意的事项：一、必须结合全面整党工作，要在农村中党的支部整理的基础上进行人民武装的整顿组织工作，人民武装干部要参加农村整党工作。二、整顿组织中要贯彻整党与民主运动的精神，在调整干部解决新老干部、民兵团结问题中，必须使党内教育与党外民主审查选举相结合。在整编民兵自卫队的各种任务队及整理勤务工作，必须深入宣传教育，结合广泛的民主评议。在审查恢复干部与民兵中，应纠正对中农关门的思想。在解决上述问题中，不能单纯从整理人民武装组织出发，应视为整党与纠正执行政策偏差之一部分。三、对组织中很坏的分子，要坚决洗刷，吸收基本群众中之积极分子参加民兵。丙、整组的步骤与方式：一、整顿组织的时间与步骤，各地区应按区党委规定的工作序列，在其范围内有步骤的转入整理人民武装工作。二、整顿组织的方式一般的可采取重点领导带动附近村庄的方法。三、健全组织、清查武器、整顿纪律、整顿战勤等应有计划的结合进行。
    第二、在整顿组织的基础上进行冬训
    甲、要求：民兵自卫队的组织健全以后，应利用农闲进行训练。腹心地区之民兵自卫队，应以政治教育与任务教育为主，提高其阶级觉悟，以达到自觉的执行任务与遵守纪律。教育内容为时事、纪律、任务、技术及参战支前时所必须的军事知识等。边沿地区民兵则应以军事政治并重，教育内容为政策、时事、战术与军事技术（射击、投弹、埋雷等）。乙、方式方法：一、在民兵自卫队训练之前，应首先训练教员，或用队员教队员的方式，事前应有充分准备，每次上课时间不要过长，政治教育可以与冬学结合，在边沿地区民兵应注意与实战结合。二、为了不妨害群众生产，一般的应以村为单位进行，不做大规模的集体训练，但可以以区或小区（乡）为单位，以检阅的方式进行，但每次时间不超过一天为原则（自带干粮）。三、由军区或分区开办干部轮训队，轮训在职之区、村干部及支前之民工干部。训练内容与时间，由各二级军区武装部计划之。
    第三、加强边沿地区对敌斗争的领导
    主动积极的向敌区出击，开展爆炸运动，围困封锁敌人，敌人出扰时，要开展联防扭击战，坚决执行保粮保丁的任务，并注意结合各种斗争及建立民兵组织工作。腹心地区之民兵及警备部队，在军区或警司领导与指挥下，自动维持治安，但必须听从治安部门的指挥与指导。开展冬防运动，及时有力的镇压匪特之活动。以上各项工作，各区可根据本区具体情况详细布置，并将布置情形及执行情形随时向本部报告，整顿组织与训练完成后，并望总结上报。
