　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th—TASS Tokyo: The Japan Trade Union Joining the World Federation of Trade Unions Promotion Committee recently received an invitation from World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant, inviting Japanese trade unions to attend the World Federation of Trade Unions Second Congress in Brussels in December. Committee Secretary-General Watanabe stated: Japanese trade unions are preparing to send representatives to the meeting, and the committee will maintain regular contact with the World Federation of Trade Unions. *Akahata* reported: The Japanese government withheld Saillant's invitation for eight days. According to Agence France-Presse: This organization was formed last year by the two largest trade union federations in Japan—the Communist Party-led National Congress of Industrial Organizations (Sanbetsu) and the Socialist Party-led Japanese Federation of Labor (Sodomei)—with the aim of promoting the unification of Japanese trade unions and joining the World Federation of Trade Unions, but its activities have been hindered by the US-Japanese authorities.
