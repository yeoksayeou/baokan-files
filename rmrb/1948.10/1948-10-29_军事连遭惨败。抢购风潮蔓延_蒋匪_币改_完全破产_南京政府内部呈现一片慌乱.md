Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. As the Kuomintang suffers successive disastrous defeats on the front lines, and a fierce wave of panic buying sweeps through various cities in its rear, the Nanjing government is in a state of panic. According to various reports: The "legislators" of the Nanjing puppet Legislative Yuan "are shocked by the nationwide panic buying craze" (Reuters, 7th), and hurriedly held a full-day "secret meeting to review prices" on the 18th. At this meeting, puppet Finance Minister Wang Yunwu was forced to admit that the so-called financial and economic "emergency measures" of August 19 had completely gone bankrupt, admitting that "currency reform has not curbed inflation," and also admitting that "in the past two months, the financial deficit has reached 500 million gold yuan." The "guarantee" that Wang Yunwu boasted on August 19 that "the budget can be close to balanced in the future" went completely bankrupt in less than two months.

At the same meeting, puppet Premier Weng Wenhao admitted: "The government cannot balance the budget, and the continued deficit has further impacted the unbalanced economy." "Military setbacks have shaken the people's confidence in the (Kuomintang) government's currency reform." (Associated Press, 18th) At the same time, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department successively issued three editorials in party newspapers, desperately wailing: The failure of the new currency system will make "the tragic scene of the country (the Kuomintang's traitorous rule) being destroyed and the party being exterminated easily come before our eyes."

Interspersed with these wails are new quarrels within the Kuomintang ruling clique. The profit-seeking factions of the Kuomintang are also not relaxing their efforts to seize the opportunity of the collapse of the puppet gold yuan to carry out their fierce struggle for power and profit. According to a report by United Press: At the puppet Legislative Yuan meeting on the 18th, "Weng Wenhao of the Political Science faction was subjected to an unprecedentedly fierce attack by the CC clique. Weng Wenhao was ridiculed by hisses from the audience and was asked to resign."

　　军事连遭惨败。抢购风潮蔓延
  　蒋匪“币改”完全破产
  　南京政府内部呈现一片慌乱
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】当国民党在前线上遭受接连的惨败，其后方各城市蔓延着猛烈的抢购潮之际，南京政府内部呈现着一片慌乱。据各方报导：南京伪立法院的“立委们正为如火燎原似的蔓延全国的抢购风潮所震惊”（路透社七日电），急急忙忙于十八日举行了一整天的“检讨物价秘密会议”。在这一次会议上，伪财长王云五被迫承认八月十九日的所谓财政经济“紧急措施”已完全破产，承认“币制改革未曾制止通货膨胀”，而且承认“过去两个月内，财政亏空已达五亿金圆”。王云五在八月十九日所吹的那套“今后预算可以接近平衡的牛皮，为时不到两个月，就全部破产。
    在同一会议中，伪政院长翁文灏承认：“政府不能平衡预算，而且继续存在的赤字已对不能平衡的经济发生进一步的影响。”“军事失利动摇了人民对（国民党）政府币改的信心。”（美联社十八日电）与此同时，国民党中宣部先后发出三篇党报社论，绝望的哀鸣：新币制的失败，将使“国（国民党卖国统治）亡党灭的惨象，很容易就到眼前来了”。
    与这些哀号相夹杂的是国民党统治集团内部新的争吵。唯利是图的国民党各派别，也毫不放松利用伪金圆券垮台的机会去进行其争权夺利的激烈斗争。据合众社报导：在十八日的伪立法院会议上“政学系的翁文灏遭到ＣＣ集团被称之为空前激烈的一次攻击，翁文灏为台下以嗤嗤之声相讥，并被要求辞职。”
