　　The area south of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region (i.e., southwestern Shandong Province) has been a major battlefield for fierce struggles between the enemy and us since the Liberation War. In the past six months, after experiencing four enemy "offensives" and "sweeps," the Party, government, army, and people of Henan Province, together with the broad masses, have worked hard and finally defended the region, protected the interests of the masses, and powerfully coordinated with the main force in combat, achieving a great victory. Now, except for the four counties of Yutai, Shanxian, Caoxian, and Dingtao, which are still occupied by the enemy, most of southwestern Shandong has been liberated.
    In mid-February, the enemy, mainly the 5th Army, drove straight in and advanced to the Shatuji area (Yunju County). In mid-March, the enemy, still the 5th Army and the 84th Division, crossed the Juhe Highway and advanced to the river crossings along the Yellow River. In mid-April, the enemy, mainly the 5th Army, with a total of thirteen main brigades, came north in an attempt to block our East China Field Army from crossing the river, advancing to the Shanxian, Chengwu, and Dingtao line, and carrying out a long-term "encirclement and suppression sweep" for more than fifty days in our 3rd, 5th, and 2nd sub-districts. The struggle was unprecedentedly fierce. The fourth time was after the enemy's disastrous defeat in eastern Henan. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to cover up his mistakes in personally directing the defeat, and regardless of the complaints of his subordinates, reluctantly launched another seesaw "sweep" against Henan in mid-July. Although the enemy used forces totaling seventeen brigades, including the bandit 5th Army, the 47th Army, the Huang Botao Corps, the Cavalry Brigade, and the 83rd Division, they had been fragmented in eastern Henan, and their morale was extremely low. After Huang Botao's troops arrived in Chengwu from Shangqiu, they fled back to the railway to Kai Xuzhou. After the enemy's 5th Army, 83rd Division, and 47th Army arrived in Dingtao, they were met with a head-on blow and stopped in their tracks. Three or four days later, our main force transferred, and the 47th Army dared to reach Juancheng on the 16th, and the 5th Army and 83rd Division reached the south bank of the Yellow River.
    Because the enemy took revenge after their disastrous defeat in eastern Henan, and were extremely vicious, the morale of our Henan soldiers and civilians was even stronger. The Dingtao people's armed forces defeated the puppet Dingtao Brigade's grain robbery in three battles, killing and wounding 56 enemies, and driving the enemy ten miles away each time. Cadres and militiamen in Chengwu County persisted in fighting the enemy even with the enemy present in eight districts of the county, repelling attacks by large groups of bandits and thwarting the attempts of the puppet commissioner's office and three exiled puppet county governments to grab grain and conscript soldiers in Chengwu. After this mass anti-"sweep," the confidence and determination of all soldiers and civilians to persist in guerrilla warfare was further enhanced, giving our main force time to rest and reorganize. The price paid by the bandits was being exhausted, with large numbers of soldiers deserting and morale being scattered. The seesaw "sweeping" enemy was forced to flee south on August 20. In August, the Chiang bandits actively sabotaged our Yellow River dike. Our military region, in order to protect the interests of the masses, immediately organized all forces to fight for the protection of the Yellow River. Despite the enemy's constant strafing and bombing, our Henan soldiers and civilians and comrades of the Yellow River Committee disregarded all difficulties and dangers and launched a struggle to protect the Yellow River, finally completing most of the project on August 20, and turning the dangerous work into safety. After August, the enemy's main force, the 5th Army, transferred to Shangqiu, and the 63rd Brigade of the bandit 83rd Division was transferred to Xuzhou. After the liberation of Jinan, the enemy occupying Heze, the capital of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, which had been occupied by the enemy for a year, and the enemy in Chengwu County, which had been occupied by the enemy once last month, finally abandoned the city and fled south under our military and political pressure. By this time, the hard work of the soldiers and civilians of Hebei-Shandong-Henan over the past six months has yielded great results, and except for the four cities of Yutai, Shanxian, Caoxian, and Dingtao, the vast areas of southwestern Shandong have been liberated.
    In the anti-"encirclement and suppression sweeps," the Party, government, army, and people in our Henan region waged an unprecedentedly fierce and cruel guerrilla war: except for Huashan, the entire 3rd sub-district persisted in overcoming the difficulties from beginning to end. Comrade Du Enxun, director of the 5th sub-district Armed Forces Committee, persisted in fighting in the hinterland with a working team of more than forty people, using mobile and flexible tactics to attack the enemy's arrogance, change the situation, and achieve a brilliant victory in guerrilla warfare. In the battle, many comrades shed the last drop of blood for the revolution: for example, Comrade Liu Xue'an, deputy secretary of the Chengwu County Party Committee, had a lame leg, but he always persisted in staying in the region and did not transfer, carrying out a resolute struggle against retreat and right-leaning within the Party. He was finally surrounded by the enemy, resisted to the end, and died heroically; Comrade Wang Xuejing, county magistrate of Caoxian County, was captured by the enemy, and died generously. When he was about to be executed, he promoted our Party's policies in Caoxian County, scolded the enemy, and expanded the influence of our Party, which deeply moved the broad masses. ... In addition, there are many heroic deeds of the broad masses sheltering cadres and resisting the enemy during the "encirclement and suppression sweep".
    In the unprecedentedly fierce and cruel guerrilla war in the past six months, according to incomplete statistics from the 2nd, 5th, and 7th Prefectural Committees in the past six months, a total of 3,030 battles were fought, killing 704 enemies, wounding 1,272 enemies, and capturing 754 enemies. In addition, a great amount of guns, ammunition, and grain were seized.
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan recently held the first cadre conference of counties south of the Yellow River in the past six months. Everyone's mood was extremely high, and they were full of confidence in victory. The conference summarized the experience of the six-month guerrilla war, reviewed and criticized the cadres and Party members who wavered and compromised in the struggle, and determined the future work policy: in addition to relying on the masses to vigorously develop and strengthen the local armed forces, it has already shifted to vigorously leading the masses to produce and plant wheat to eliminate wasteland. Our soldiers and civilians in the region are also actively preparing forces to meet the arrival of new struggles and strive for greater victories.

### 冀鲁豫黄河以南　半年来对敌斗争情况

　　冀鲁豫黄河以南
  　半年来对敌斗争情况
    冀鲁豫黄河南岸（即山东省西南部），从解放战争以来，经常是敌我剧烈斗争的大战场。最近半年，经历敌人四次“进攻”“扫荡”，河南党政军民全体同志与广大群众艰苦奋斗，终于坚持了地区，保卫了群众利益，有力的配合了主力作战，取得伟大胜利。现在，除鱼台、单县、曹县、定四县仍为敌人据守外，其他鲁西南大部地区已全获解放。
    二月中旬，敌以五军为主，长驱直入，进至我沙土集（郓巨县）一带。三月中旬，敌仍以五军、八十四师，直越巨菏公路，进至沿黄河各渡口。四月中旬，敌以五军为主，共十三个主力旅北来企图堵我华东野战军过河，进至单县、城武、定陶一线，在我三、五、二分区进行达五十余天的长期“清剿扫荡”，斗争空前剧烈。第四次是在敌豫东大败以后，蒋介石为掩饰他亲自指挥失败的过失，不顾其部下埋怨，勉强的又于七月中旬对河南进行了一次拉锯“扫荡”。敌虽使用兵力计有匪五军、四十七军、黄伯韬兵团、骑兵旅、八十三师等部共十七旅，但因敌在豫东已被打得支离破碎，士气极为颓丧。黄伯韬部从商邱到城武之后即窜回铁路开徐州，敌五军及八十三师、四十七军到定陶后，则被我迎头痛击，裹足不前。三四日后，我主力转移，至十六日四十七军才敢到我鄄城，五军八十三师到我黄河南岸。
    由于敌于豫东大败后采取报复，穷凶极恶，我河南军民则斗志益坚，定陶人民武装击溃伪定陶大队的抢粮，三战三捷，毙伤敌五十六名，每次均逐敌于十里之外。城武干部民兵在该县有八个区有敌人的情况下，坚持对敌斗争，打退了大股匪军进攻，粉碎了伪专署及三个流亡伪县政府在城武抢粮抓丁的企图。经过此次群众性的反“扫荡”，全体军民坚持游击战争的信心和决心更加提高，使我主力争取了时机休整，而匪所得的代价，却是疲于奔命，士兵大批逃亡，军心涣散，于是拉锯“扫荡”之敌，遂被迫于八月二十日南窜。八月份，蒋匪积极破坏我黄河大堤，我军区为保护群众利益，即组织全力为护黄而斗争。虽经敌不断扫射轰炸，我河南军民及黄委会同志不顾一切困难和危险与敌展开护黄斗争，终于八月二十日工程大部完成，险工始转危为安。八月之后，敌五军主力转至商邱，匪八十三师六十三旅调徐州；济南解放后，为敌侵占达一年久之的冀鲁豫首府菏泽，及上月一度为敌侵占的城武县城之敌，终在我军事、政治压力下弃城南逃。至此，冀鲁豫军民半年来的艰苦奋斗已获伟大结果，除鱼台、单县、曹县、定陶四城，鲁西南广大地区均获解放。
    在反“清剿扫荡”中，我河南地区党政军民进行了空前激烈残酷的游击战争：三分区除华山外，自始至终都全部坚持渡过难关。五分区武委会主任杜恩训同志，以四十余人的武工队坚持腹地斗争，用机动灵活的战术打击了敌人的气焰，转换了局面，取得游击战争的光辉胜利。在战斗中很多同志为革命流出了最后一滴血：如城武县委副书记刘雪庵同志一支腿跛，但他始终坚持地区，不转移，在党内进行坚决反退却反右倾斗争，最后被敌包围，顽抗到最后，壮烈牺牲；曹县县长王雪静同志为敌俘获，慷慨就义，临刑时，在曹县宣传我党政策，大骂敌人，扩大我党影响，广大群众深被感动。……此外在“清剿扫荡”中广大群众掩护干部，抗击敌人，其英勇事迹也很多。
    在半年来的空前激烈残酷的游击战争中，据二、五、七地委半年来不完全统计，共作战三零三零次，毙敌七零四人，伤敌一二七二人，俘敌七五四人。此外缴获枪弹粮食极多。
    冀鲁豫最近举行半年来第一次黄河南县干部大会，大家情绪极高，都充满了胜利的信心。会中总结了半年游击战争的经验，并检讨批评了在斗争中动摇妥协的干部党员，确定了今后工作方针：除依靠群众大力发展壮大地方武装外，已经转上大力领导群众生产种麦，消灭荒地。我区军民并积极准备力量迎接新的斗争到来，争取更大胜利。
