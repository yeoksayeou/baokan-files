[JiluYu Electric] Weinan First District (border area) actively solves the ideological problems of village cadres, and has achieved initial results. Some time ago, the thinking of village cadres in the district was extremely chaotic, and they generally lay down and refused to work. Many militiamen also put down their guns. The reasons for this, in addition to frequent harassment by the enemy, were mainly: First, dissatisfaction with the leadership, feeling that there was no point in working. A cadre from Wati Village said: "District cadres don't care about village cadres, and they don't tell village cadres anything about the situation or anything else." The village chief of Xiaotun Village said: "If the task is not completed, we will be criticized. If it is completed, the masses will complain, and we will not be democratic." Second, there is a lack of correct understanding of the spirit of democracy, and they feel that there is no way to do things. A cadre from Mengzhuang Village said: "With democracy, tasks cannot be pushed forward, and we will be criticized again." A cadre from Dacao Village said: "Meetings can't be held. The self-defense captain sent stretchers, but people didn't go. Instead, they ruined several acres of melons at the captain's house in the dark, and the whole family cried with anger. The district didn't deal with it." Third, there are contradictions within the village that have not been resolved. In Lintou Village, the Qiu and Yang families have conflicts. If cadres from one family are active, the other family will not work, forming mutual irresponsibility. The joint defense captain and village cadres in Baichikou community have unprincipled disagreements, forming a situation where if the joint defense captain does it, no one else will. Fourth, the district does not help the village solve practical problems; rewards and punishments are not clear. Fifth, individual villages have sabotage elements who provoke trouble. Several village cadres in Xiaotun Village were provoked by bad people and formed a clique to isolate the progressive village chief. In order to solve this problem, the district sent cadres to the villages to understand the situation, solve pending cases, and restore the organization. First, a branch meeting was held in each village to conduct criticism and self-criticism and understand the situation. Then, an expanded administrative cadre meeting above the group leader level was held to review the work, review the leadership, reflect on the ideology, and express their attitude. After the village cadres generally understood, a mass meeting was held to talk about the current situation, policies, love for the masses and support for cadres, the responsibilities of village cadres, and what democracy is. After half a month of work in the district, village cadre meetings and mass meetings were held in 41 villages. Except for the fact that the problems of cadres in two or three villages and the ideological problems of individual cadres were not resolved, most of them have cleared their minds. The serious phenomenon of village cadres lying down and the state of anarchy in the countryside have begun to change. Village cadres have begun to work, resettling landlords and rich peasants, compensating wrongly struggled households, and the militiamen who were originally lying down have picked up their guns again in all villages except for one or two.
    The main experiences in solving the ideological problems of village cadres this time are: (1) It is necessary to conduct in-depth understanding in advance, find out the main ideas of village cadres lying down, and then repeatedly mobilize and effectively solve pending cases. (2) The leadership must make a sincere examination, dare to admit mistakes, and take improving the thinking of village cadres as a regular task. Show attitude towards village cadres and care about the problems of village cadres. (3) When solving the problem of village cadres lying down, it is necessary to carry out self-criticism, and refrain from accommodating the backwardness of village cadres everywhere. If the leadership blindly admits mistakes and abandons criticism of the bad work styles and mistakes of village cadres, it will further develop the liberalism of village cadres. (4) Strengthen the branch to make it the leading core and make party members active promoters and executors of all work.

　　卫南一区纠正村干民兵错误思想
    克服无政府状态
    【冀鲁豫电】卫南一区（边沿区）积极解决村干思想问题，初获成绩。该区前些时村干思想极为混乱，普遍躺倒不工作。民兵也有许多放下了枪。其原因除敌人经常骚扰外，主要是第一，对领导不满，感到没干头，瓦堤村干部说：区干部不关心村干，有啥情况、啥事情也不向村干部说。小屯村长说：“任务完不成受批评，完成了群众反映，又落不民主。”第二，对民主精神缺乏正确了解，感觉没法干。孟庄村干部说：“民主啦，有了任务推不下去，又得受批评。”大操村干部说：“会也开不成啦，自卫队长派担架，人家不去，反而乘黑夜把队长家几亩瓜糟蹋了，全家都气得哭，区上也没处理。”第三，村内有矛盾，没得到解决。林头村邱杨二姓有矛盾，这姓干部积极，那姓就不干，形成互不负责。百尺口小区联防队长和村干部无原则的闹意见，形成联防队长干，大家都不干。第四，区上不帮助村里解决实际问题；赏罚不明。第五，个别村有破坏分子挑拨。小屯村几个村干部被坏人挑拨的结成一气，孤立进步村长。该区为解决这一问题，近由区干部分别到村，了解情况，解决悬案，恢复组织。首先在各村召开支部会，进行批评与自我批评，了解情况。再开小组长以上的扩大行政干部会，检讨工作，检讨领导，反省思想，表明态度。村干部大体闹通后，又召开群众会，讲时局，讲政策，讲爱群拥干、村干职责、啥是民主等问题。全区经过半月的工作，四十一个村都开了村干部会与群众会，除两三个村的干部问题与个别干部的思想问题没解决外，大部都打通了思想，村干部严重的躺倒现象以及农村的无政府状态已开始改变，村干部都开始了工作，安置地富、补偿错斗户，原来躺倒的民兵，除一两个村外，其他村都重新背起了枪。
    这次解决村干部思想问题的主要经验：（一）必须事先作深入的了解，找出村干躺倒的主要思想，再反复动员，切实解决悬案。（二）领导上必须作虚心的检查，敢于承认错误，并且要把提高村干部思想当作经常工作。表明对村干部的态度，关心村干部的问题。（三）解决村干躺倒问题时，要开展自我批评，切忌到处迁就村干部的落后面，领导上盲目的承认错误，对村干部的坏作风和错误放弃批评，其结果，更会发展村干部的自由主义。（四）加强支部使其成为领导核心，使党员成为一切工作的积极推动和执行者。
