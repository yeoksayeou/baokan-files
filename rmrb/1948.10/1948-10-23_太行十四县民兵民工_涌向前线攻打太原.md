[Taihang Electric Message] "Fight to Taiyuan, capture Yan Xishan alive!" Militia and civilian laborers from fourteen counties in Taihang, including Zanhuang, Lincheng, Zuoquan, Shexian, and Licheng, are surging to the Jinzhong front lines to assist the army in combat. As early as late August, the masses in various places actively prepared to participate in the war, awaiting orders to depart. When the news of the fall of Jinan reached Huguan, Comrade Qin Haifa, a model participant in the war from the third district of the county and a neighborhood committee member, busily and carefully inspected a civilian labor company that had already been organized in the Nanzhuang neighborhood, and said to the civilian laborers: "Jinan has been liberated, and Taiyuan will soon be liberated too. We must be fully prepared, ready to go when we are told." In Zanhuang's Shouyu Village, only fourteen militiamen were originally planned to go, but at the mobilization meeting, eighteen people signed up. Cadres tried to dissuade four who were physically weak from going, but they were all very unhappy. Shi Xiaowu from Nan Zhuli in the county was covered in scabies, but still insisted on participating in the war. Civilian laborers from the sixth district of Zuoquan braved the rain and hurried to deliver grain on muddy roads. They all said, "For the sake of supporting the front and defeating old Yan, it doesn't matter if our clothes get wet." The participating militiamen from Licheng County gathered in the starry night on the eighth and set off for the front lines. Many people said, "This time, Yan Xishan is finished. We haven't been able to enter Taiyuan for ten years, but now we're going to go and have a look!"

　　太行十四县民兵民工
  　涌向前线攻打太原
    【太行电】“打到太原去，活捉阎锡山!”赞皇、临城、左权、涉县、黎城等十四县民兵民工涌向晋中前线，协助军队作战。在八月下旬，各地群众就积极准备参战，待命出发。打下济南的消息传到壶关时，该县三区参战模范，小区委员秦海法同志就忙把南庄小区已经组织好的一个民工连，仔细检查了一遍，并对民工说：“济南解放了，就快解放太原了，我们要完全准备好，说走就走。”赞皇寿峪村原来只准备十四个民兵去，在动员大会上，就有十八个人报名，干部劝阻四个身子弱的不要去，他们都很不高兴。该县南竹里时小五，身上长了一身疥，还非要求参战不行。左权六区民工，冒着雨在泥泞的道路上赶着送粮。都说：“为了支前打老阎，湿了衣服没关系。”黎城全县参战民兵，于八日星夜集中，开赴前线，许多人都说：“这回阎锡山可该完蛋啦，十年来没得进太原，这会可要去看看！”
