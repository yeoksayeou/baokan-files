　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: New York dispatch: Progressive Party leaders announced that their party has obtained full qualification for elections in twenty-four of the forty-eight states in the United States and is awaiting formal recognition in another twelve states. In states such as Nebraska, Maine, and Missouri, reactionaries have refused the Progressive Party's application to participate in the election through illegal decisions. In Georgia, the center of activity for the American fascist Ku Klux Klan, police in Atlantic City alone arrested fifteen Progressive Party leaders. However, party members, disregarding police terror, launched a resolute struggle to collect application signatures. To date, 70,000 signatures have been collected; according to state law, only 50,000 signatures need to be submitted before October 2nd to qualify. Baldwin, the director of the Progressive Party campaign committee, announced that he has requested Attorney General Clark to protect Progressive Party members in Georgia. Baldwin pointed out that the Ku Klux Klan is cooperating with the police to implement terrorist tactics against the Progressive Party in that state, and the majority of the police in Atlantic City are themselves members of the Ku Klux Klan.

　　美进步党在廿四州取得完全竞选资格
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】纽约讯：据进步党领袖宣布该党已在美国四十八州中之二十四州，取得完全的竞选资格，并正等待另十二州的正式承认。在内布拉斯加、缅因、密苏里等州，反动派则以非法决定，拒绝了进步党参加竞选的申请。在美国法西斯三Ｋ党活动中心的乔治亚州，仅在大西洋城一地警察即逮捕了进步党领袖十五人，但该党人员仍不顾警察恐怖行为，展开了征集申请书签名的坚决斗争，迄今签名者已达七万人；按该州法律，规定在十月二日之前只须提出五万人的签名即告合格。据进步党竞选委员会主任鲍尔温宣布：他已要求司法部长克拉克保护乔治亚州的进步党员。鲍氏指出：三Ｋ党与警察合作对该州的进步党施行恐怖手段，大西洋城的绝大部分警察本身就是三Ｋ党徒。
