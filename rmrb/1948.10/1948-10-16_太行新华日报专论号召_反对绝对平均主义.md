　　Taihang Xinhua Daily Editorial Calls for Opposition to Absolute Egalitarianism
　　[Taihang Electric] To correctly launch the concluding phase of the land reform movement after the autumn harvest, the *Xinhua Daily* here published an editorial entitled "Oppose Absolute Egalitarianism and Correctly Conclude Land Reform." It stated in brief: In the work of concluding land reform before the autumn, it has been discovered in many places that absolute egalitarianism is still very serious among cadres and the masses. Some cadres in the Second District of Shahe stipulated that supplements and withdrawals should be carried out according to the average amount of land in the entire village. Those who had already turned over in the past, but whose land had relatively decreased due to population increase (marriage and childbirth), were supplemented to the average level. Those whose land had relatively increased due to population decrease (illness and death) were to be withdrawn from. Cadres, party members, and military dependents who received more fruit must hand it over (those who received more fruit should hand it over; this cannot be called egalitarianism – Editor). Cadres and party member training classes in Yusha Village believed that the source of compensation stipulated by the District Party Committee could not solve the land problem, so they increased the amount of land collected through donations and immigration, telling the households who had returned to the village after turning over to go back to the mountains. Households above the village average were all subject to withdrawals. It was also discovered in the First District that the average yield was used as a benchmark, and those with higher yields had portions withdrawn. Such phenomena have occurred in other places as well, resulting in some new confusion in the countryside. For example, military dependents in Shahe went to village cadres to return land to their sons, and households with higher incomes waited to have their land withdrawn, feeling uneasy about production, etc., which added many difficulties to the next stage of work. In Huanglu Village, Ci County, the compensation issue hurt the middle peasants, and a new round of rectification was carried out. Therefore, before we fully launch the concluding phase of the land reform work after the autumn, we must quickly and correctly resolve this issue. The main reason why this absolute egalitarianism has not been thoroughly resolved is that leading organs at all levels have underestimated the specific difficulties in concluding land reform, especially the ideological distance between cadres and the masses. Everyone unanimously felt that concluding land reform was a requirement of the broad masses and cadres and would be smoothly accepted by the masses and cadres. This work would not be difficult to carry out. Therefore, at the August meeting of the District Party Committee, all prefectural and county committees only focused on discussing how to arrange and deploy the work. However, the study and resolution of policies and ideological issues based on the actual situation was insufficient. The same was true when the county conveyed the spirit at the county and district expanded cadre meetings or district and village cadre training classes. District and village cadres were in high spirits or promised that concluding land reform would not be a problem. The leadership then believed that everything was fine. Therefore, not enough attention was paid to resolving specific problems. In reality, due to the historical influence of the "Left," there is a strong atmosphere of absolute egalitarianism among the masses, party members, and cadres in the countryside. Poor peasants and hired laborers who have not been thoroughly turned over demand absolute equality, and village and district cadres can only talk about general principles. When they encounter specific difficulties (few sources, large loopholes), they cannot explain it themselves and feel that inequality is unacceptable. This is consistent with the absolute egalitarianism of some of the masses, and the main spirit of concluding land reform – resolving outstanding issues and uniting for production – has gone awry. To successfully complete the concluding phase of land reform, we must address this reality and resolve the absolute egalitarianism among cadres and the masses. This requires us to start from the specific situation in the countryside, clearly explain various policy issues and sources of compensation, and solve the practical difficulties of district and village cadres in the concluding phase of land reform. Otherwise, simply shouting slogans against absolute egalitarianism will not solve the problem.

### 太行新华日报专论号召　反对绝对平均主义

　　太行新华日报专论号召
  　反对绝对平均主义
    【太行电】为了秋收后正确的开展结束土改运动，此间新华日报以“反对绝对平均主义，正确进行结束土改”为题发表专论。略称：秋前结束土改工作中，不少地方发现干部与群众中绝对平均主义思想还很严重。沙河二区某些干部规定按全村土地平均数进行抽补。过去已翻身，因人口增加（娶妻生子）土地相对减少者，补到水平。人口减少（疾病死亡）土地相对增多者，要抽。干部、党员、军属多分果实者必须拿出（多分果实应当拿出，这不能叫做平均主义——编者）。揄社村干部、党员训练班中，认为按区党委规定之补偿来源，不能解决土地问题，又增加募捐地及移民地，叫回村翻身之户再回山上去。高于全村水平户都抽。一区也发现按产量推平，高者抽出。其他各地都有此种现象发生，以致造成农村某些新的混乱。如沙河军属找村干部退地要儿子，翻身高的户等抽地，不安心生产等等，给下段工作增加了不少困难。磁县黄碌村因补偿而刺伤了中农，又来了一次新的纠偏。因此在秋后将要全力开展结束土改工作之前，必须迅速正确解决这一问题。这种绝对平均主义思想一直未能彻底解决的主要原因，是各级领导机关对结束土改的具体困难特别是干部与群众的思想距离估计不足。大家都一致感觉到结束土改是广大群众和干部的要求，一定会为群众和干部顺利接受。这一工作不难进行。所以在区党委八月会议上，各地委县委都只着重讨论如何安排布置。而根据实际情况研究解决政策和思想问题就显得不够。在县里开县区扩干会或区村干部训练班传达时，也是如此。区村干部情绪很高，或答应结束土改不成问题。领导上就认为万事大吉。因而对具体问题的解决重视不够。实际农村中由于左的历史影响，群众与党员、干部中是存在着一种浓厚的绝对平均主义空气的。未翻透身的贫雇要求绝对平，村区干部也只会说大道理，一接触到具体困难（来源少窟窿大），自己就无法解释，感到不平均不行。这就与一部分群众的绝对平均主义一致起来，把结束土改的主要精神解决遗留问题、团结生产走了样子。为胜利完成结束土改工作，我们必须针对这一现实情况解决干部与群众中的绝对平均主义思想，这就必须从农村具体情况出发，明确解释各种政策问题及补偿来源，解决区村干部在结束土改工作中的实际困难。否则空喊反对绝对平均，也不能解决问题。
