Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th -- A handwritten order from Chiang Kai-shek to Zheng Dongguo, Zeng Zesheng, and Li Hong on the 15th, instructing them to withdraw from Changchun, has been handed over to the People's Liberation Army by General Zeng Zesheng. The order states: "Changchun Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo, and forwarded to Army Commander Zeng Zesheng, Army Commander Li Hong: Your letter of October 10th has been received; now all bandit columns have been attracted by me to the western Liaoning area, and all units should immediately begin to act in accordance with the order. Now, as machine fuel and oil are lacking, even if the defending troops become completely starved corpses, there will be no further opportunity to retreat. If there is any further delay, it will result in a loss of opportunity, putting the entire battle situation at a disadvantage. The Deputy Commander and Army Commanders, etc., will be charged with disobeying orders and will be subject to severe military disciplinary sanctions. Zhongzheng Shanzi (midnight on the 15th) has come to Shenyang to command. Inform them. Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten note, 巳时, October 15th.” Looking at this order in Changchun today, it is truly a great irony. Changchun has been liberated, but none of the people Chiang Kai-shek ordered to withdraw have carried out his orders. Chiang Kai-shek's order was delivered to Changchun by plane on the 15th, but on the 16th, it was handed over to the People's Liberation Army by General Zeng Zesheng. The many inconsistencies in this handwritten order reveal Chiang Kai-shek's panic. At that time, although the Kuomintang garrison in Changchun had not yet become completely starved corpses, they were close to being so, and the city was surrounded on all sides by the People's Liberation Army, making it impossible to escape even with wings. The fact is not that the People's Liberation Army was attracted by Chiang bandit troops in the western Liaoning area, but that the main force of the Chiang bandit troops in Shenyang was attracted by the People's Liberation Army in the western Liaoning area, so that Chiang bandit troops did not send a single soldier to reinforce the Changchun Chiang troops' breakout. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek still wanted to threaten his subordinates with "military disciplinary sanctions." Observers here say that Chiang Kai-shek's purpose in doing so was to exonerate himself and shift the blame for "putting the entire battle situation at a disadvantage" onto others. Chiang Kai-shek's trick has completely failed this time. General Zeng Zesheng received Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten order and immediately launched an anti-Chiang uprising. Immediately afterwards, Generals Zheng Dongguo and Li Hong led their entire armies to lay down their arms and surrender. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "military disciplinary sanctions" are nothing but empty words. In the current situation, anyone who is slightly clever knows: is it better to be a prisoner like Wang Yaowu, Fan Hanjie, Zhang Zuoxiang, and Lu Junquan? Or is it better to stand on the side of the People's Liberation Army and oppose Chiang Kai-shek?

### 一个大讽刺！　蒋介石命令郑洞国等撤出长春　这手令已由曾泽生交给解放军

　　一个大讽刺！
  　蒋介石命令郑洞国等撤出长春
  　这手令已由曾泽生交给解放军
    【新华社长春二十日电】蒋介石十五日命令郑洞国、曾泽生、李鸿撤出长春的手令，已由曾泽生将军交给解放军。手令称：“长春郑副司令洞国，并转曾军长泽生、李军长鸿：十月十日手令计达；现匪各纵队均被我吸引于辽西方面，各部应遵令即刻开始行动。现机、油均缺，尔后即令守军全成饿殍，亦无再有转进之机会。如再迟延，有失机宜，陷全般战局于不利，该副总司令、军长等，即以违抗命令论罪，应受到严厉之军纪制裁。中正删子（十五日子时）已来沈指挥。知照。中正手启，十月十五日巳时。”在今天的长春来看这个命令，确是一个大讽刺。长春是解放了，但是蒋介石下令撤退的人，一个也没有执行他的命令。蒋介石的命令十五日就由飞机投送长春，但是十六日就被曾泽生将军送给了解放军。这个手令的种种不通，画出了蒋介石的惊慌失措。当时长春的国民党守军虽未全成饿殍，也已和饿殍差不多，而城外又被解放军四面包围着，插翅也飞不出去。事实并不是什么解放军被蒋匪军吸引于辽西方面，而是沈阳的蒋匪军主力被解放军吸引于辽西方面，因而蒋匪没有一兵一卒来接应长春蒋军的突围。在这种时候，蒋介石却还要以“军纪制裁”去威胁他的部下。此间观察家说：蒋介石这样做的目的，乃是为了开脱自己的责任，把“陷全般战局于不利”的罪名推给旁人。蒋介石的这一套把戏，这一回彻底破产了。曾泽生将军接到了蒋介石的手令，随即举行反蒋起义。紧接着郑洞国、李鸿两将军就率领全军缴械投诚。蒋介石的什么“军纪制裁”，不过是一句空话。在现在的局势下，稍为聪明一点的人就知道：究竟是学王耀武、范汉杰、张作相、卢浚泉那样做俘虏好些呢？还是站在人民解放军一边反对蒋介石好些？
