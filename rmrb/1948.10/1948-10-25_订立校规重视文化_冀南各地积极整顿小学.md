　　【Ji'nan Electric】In order to effectively manage rural education during the favorable agricultural slack season this winter, various areas in Ji'nan are carrying out rectification of primary schools. Linzhang County, since correcting the "left-leaning" deviations in education work, has seen the development of primary schools to 112, but only one-third of school-age children are enrolled, with a large number of school-age children being kept outside the school gates. The primary schools that have been established still have many shortcomings. Teachers have low cultural levels and cannot meet the students' requirements. Secondly, they lack experience and don't know how to manage. Students make noise and cause trouble after entering school, which parents are dissatisfied with and the masses do not support. The county government convened an education meeting on September 22nd. Issues such as teaching principles, management methods, and teacher organization meeting systems were hotly discussed. Finally, it was stipulated: (1) Emphasis should be placed on cultural education. In the future, children's groups must not participate in social activities or production labor too much, which would affect cultural learning. (2) Strengthen the work of children's organizations, promote children's ability to manage themselves, but teachers still cannot abandon leadership and enlightenment work. (3) The central school will hold a joint teacher meeting every Sunday to exchange experiences and discuss solutions to difficulties in the work, so as to improve the teachers themselves. Regarding teaching issues, it is stipulated that cultural courses such as Chinese and arithmetic must be taken seriously, and compositions must be written every week. Primary school students should write couplets, and all must write in regular script. Writing simplified or incorrect characters is opposed. It is also stipulated that storytelling or teaching through concrete facts can be used in class, so that children like to see and hear and are easily accepted. Before the autumn vacation of the Fourth District Primary School in Qinghe, a meeting of all teachers in the district was held on the 27th of last month to review and summarize the work. The meeting reviewed that the previous education work was very chaotic. The district had no education assistant, and the village had no cultural and educational cadres. In some villages, teachers could not even get food, forming a serious phenomenon of no one managing primary schools. As a result, teachers' morale was low. In terms of internal management of primary schools, one method was compulsory orders. Wang Zhanxuan, a teacher in Xiaoyi Village, organized a cheerleading squad. Whoever didn't come would be forcibly pulled to the house or fined with a towel, which was opposed by students' parents. Later, he adopted forced labor, asking students to carry water and sweep the yard, etc., as a disguised form of corporal punishment, creating a phenomenon of children being afraid to go to school. The other method was laissez-faire, with students coming if they wanted to, and teachers adopting the attitude of teaching one at a time (several classes a day, regardless of whether they listened or not). Based on the above situation, in order to strengthen the leadership of primary school education, the district government decided to set up an education assistant in the district and a cultural and educational officer in the village, so as to be specifically responsible. It is also stipulated that the central school will hold regular meetings to promptly check and solve difficulties, correct deviations, and resolutely implement the new education policy. There were a total of 116 school-age children in Matou Village, Qiuxian County. Only a dozen or so came when school started this wheat season. After the teacher took the initiative to study with the village cadres, they convened a parents' meeting on each street and found that many children were secretly skipping school without the knowledge of their parents and teachers. When soliciting opinions on the school, the masses said: "The school is well-run, but once the children enter school, they are out of their control, and they can't do anything." In order to appropriately take care of family production, a leave system jointly responsible by parents and teachers was stipulated. A leave certificate was made, with the student's name written on it. This certificate was kept by the student's parents. When taking leave, the certificate was taken and approved by the teacher. Since its implementation, the phenomenon of truancy has been stopped, and the number of students has increased to 96.

　　订立校规重视文化
  　冀南各地积极整顿小学
    【冀南电】为在今冬农闲的有利季节，切实办好乡村教育，冀南各地正进行整顿小学。临漳自纠正了教育工作中左倾偏向以来，全县小学发展到一百十二处，但入学儿童仅占三分之一，大批的学龄儿童被关在学校门外，已开办着的小学仍有很多缺点，教员文化水平低，不能满足学生要求。其次是经验少没办法，不会管理，学生入了学乱打乱闹，家长不满意，群众不拥护。县府于九月廿二日召开教育会议，关于教学方针、管理方法及教员组织会议制度等问题，均经热烈讨论，最后规定：（一）重视文化教育，今后一定不使儿童团过多的参加社会活动或生产劳动而影响文化学习。（二）加强儿童组织工作，发扬儿童管理自己的能力，但教员仍不能放弃领导与进行启发工作。（三）每星期日中心学校开教员联席会，交流经验，讨论解决工作中的困难问题，以便提高教员本身。关于教学问题，规定必须认真上国语、算术等文化课，每星期必须作文，小学生则联句，一律须写大楷，反对写白字简别字等；并规定可以用讲故事、或通过具体事实的教学方法上堂课，这样儿童喜见乐闻容易接受。清河四区小学秋假期满开学前，在上月廿七日召开全区教员会议，检讨总结工作。会上检讨出以往教育工作很紊乱，区没有教育助理，村没有文教干部，有的村教员连饭也吃不上，形成小学没人管的严重现象。因此教员情绪低落。在小学内部管理上，一种是强迫命令的作法，孝义屯教员王展选组织拉拉队，谁不来就到家硬拉或罚手巾的办法，遭到学生家长的反对，以后又采取了罚劳役，叫学生担水扫院子等变相体罚，造成儿童恐惧入学的现象，另一种是放任自流，学生愿来就来，教员采取来一个教一个的态度（每天几堂课，不管听不听）。区政府根据以上情况，为加强小学教育的领导，决定区设教育助理，村设文教干事，以便专门负责。并规定中心校定期开会，及时检查及时解决困难，纠正偏向，坚决贯彻新教育方针。邱县马头村学龄儿童共一百十六名，今年麦季开学只到了十几个，教员主动与村干研究后，就分街召集家长会，发现好多儿童不经家长与教员知道偷偷逃学现象。征求对学校意见时，群众说：“学办的到不错，只是小孩入了学就不由己了，想办点事也不行。”为适当照顾家庭生产，规定了有家长与教员共同负责的请假制，制一请假证，上写学生姓名，此证由学生家长负责保存，请假时则拿证由教员批准。自执行以来制止了逃学现象，学生增加到九十六名。
