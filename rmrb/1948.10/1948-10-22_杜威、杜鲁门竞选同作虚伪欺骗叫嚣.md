Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: New York dispatch: With the election day of November 2nd approaching, the Democratic presidential candidate Truman, from September 17th to October 2nd, and the Republican presidential candidate Dewey, from September 19th to October 1st, successively went to the western states for their first so-called "campaign trips." What people heard from Truman and Dewey's numerous speeches was merely rhetoric with basically the same content. A relatively representative example of these speeches is Dewey's so-called "Nine-Point Foreign Policy" delivered in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 30th. He advocated the establishment of a United States of Europe, supported the Marshall Plan, strengthened cooperation and joint defense in the Western Hemisphere, enhanced American military strength, and strengthened aid to Chiang Kai-shek. These are a series of measures of American imperialism's expansionist policy, but Dewey called them a foreign policy "engaged in peace," which illustrates the hypocrisy and deception of Dewey's speech and also shows the American people's desire for peace. In Dewey's other speeches on domestic issues, he repeatedly expressed fear about America's current "dangerous inflation and the economic collapse that will follow," and emphasized that to implement his foreign policy, it is necessary to have not only a strong military force but also domestic economic prosperity. However, apart from offering some well-known but impossible-to-fulfill promises such as curbing high prices, solving the housing shortage, and expanding social insurance, he could not provide any concrete guarantees. Truman's speeches were even more empty. The most ridiculous thing is that he actually attacked the Republican Party as "a tool of the privileged class," while proclaiming himself as "liberalism" and asking "people with liberal beliefs" not to "lean towards a third party because of concerns about the world situation." But in reality, as Wallace said in his speech in Ohio, the Democratic and Republican parties are just "the same stuff, and their platforms do not give voters a progressive choice."

　　杜威、杜鲁门竞选同作虚伪欺骗叫嚣
    【新华社陕北十九日电】纽约讯：在十一月二日的大选日见逼近之下，美民主党总统候选人杜鲁门自九月十七日至十月二日，共和党总统候选人杜威自九月十九日至十月一日先后赴西部各州作了第一次的所谓“竞选旅行”。人们从杜鲁门与杜威的多次演说中听到的只是内容基本上相同的叫嚣。这些演说中比较有代表性的，是杜威九月卅日在犹他州盐湖城发表的所谓“九点外交政策”。他主张成立欧洲合众国，支持马歇尔计划，加强西半球合作与联防，增强美国军事力量及加强援蒋。这是美帝国主义的扩张政策的一系列措施，但杜威却称之为“从事和平”的外交政策，这说明了杜威演说的虚伪与欺骗，也说明了美国人民对和平的渴望。在杜威其他关于内政问题的演说中，他一再对美国目前“危险的通货膨胀与将继之而起的经济崩溃”表示恐惧，并强调要实行他的外交政策，必须不仅有强大的军事力量，还须有国内的经济繁荣。但他除了提出一些制止物价高涨，解决房荒，扩充社会保险之类尽人皆知其不能兑现的诺言外，却提不出任何具体保证。杜鲁门的演说更为空洞。最可笑的是他居然攻击共和党是“特权阶级的工具”，而自以“自由主义”标榜，要求“具有自由信仰的人民”不要“因为对世界局势的关切而倾向第三党”。但实际上正如华莱士在俄亥俄州的演说中所说的那样，民主共和两党只是“一样的货色，他们的政纲没有给选民以进步选择的余地”。
