　　Li Cheng Inspects Production Leadership
  　Two Styles, Two Results
    [Taihang Electric] The fourth district of Li Cheng held a meeting of key village cadres in Qucun on the 19th of last month, where it was revealed that village cadres have two different leadership styles in the current autumn cultivation work, resulting in two different outcomes. One style involves deep leadership, and currently most of the valley land has been plowed. The other style is formalism, where the harvesting and cultivation work is seriously left to drift. For example, the cadres of Hexigou Village, at the beginning of the autumn busy season, the village chief started with current affairs education, accurately calculated labor and animal power, and mobilized the masses to support the front lines of production. One hundred and forty-seven full and semi-able-bodied men and women were organized into twelve groups, each of which formulated a harvesting and cultivation plan. Under the guidance of rational division of labor and the combination of harvesting and cultivation, starting from the 19th of last month, most of the grain in the valley was harvested within ten days, and 405 mu were plowed, leaving only 63 mu unplowed. After ten days, a timely summary was conducted, models were inspected and praised, and a plan for the next ten days was formulated. Currently, the village is actively continuing to complete the harvesting and cultivation work, while also actively developing autumn manure accumulation. However, the situation in Qianzhuang Village is not the same. After receiving the notice of the key point meeting on the 18th, the village cadres immediately convened a production committee to discuss how to report their work at the key point meeting. It was decided on the spot that the village had nine mutual aid groups and three teams, with each group sending one person to form a regulation share, and on the 19th, they reported these situations at the key point meeting. When district cadres asked them what the regulation share regulated, the village chief said he didn't know. The instructor said it was regulating technology! But then he quickly changed his mind and said that each group sent one person to organize a technical guidance share. When district cadres asked what technology was being guided, Li Jinshui said it was guiding which piece was yellow and should be harvested first. According to the village's report, mutual aid was all in form, production was drifting, and nothing was said about how to lead harvesting and cultivation and women's participation in the fields. Li Jinshui led a mutual aid group with a total of two households and two laborers, and he himself served as the formal leader, but he didn't talk about any specific activities. These cadres' leadership style seriously exhibits formalism, and they fabricate false reports, believing that as long as they have something to say at the meeting to give an account to the higher authorities, that's enough.

　　黎城检查生产领导
  　两种作风两样结果
    【太行电】黎城四区于上月十九日在渠村召开的基点村干部会议上，检查出村干部在当前的秋耕工作中存在着两种不同的领导作风，得到两种不同结果。一种是领导深入，目前谷地已大部犁完；一种是形式主义，收耕工作严重自流，如河西沟村干部，秋忙一开始，该村村长即从时事教育入手，精确计算劳畜力，发动群众生产支前，男女全半劳力一百四十七人，组织起十二个小组，各组都订出收耕计划。在劳力合理分工收耕结合进行的指导下，从上月十九日起，十天内谷已大部割完，并犁了四百零五亩，只有六十三亩未犁。十天后又及时进行了总结，检查与表扬模范，并订出后十天计划。现该村正积极继续完成收耕，结合开展秋季积肥。但前庄村却不是这样，该村干部在十八日接到基点会议的通知后，就连夜召开生产委员会，讨论如何到基点会上汇报工作。当场决定了村里有九个互助组三个大队，每组出一人组织一个调剂股，十九日就到基点会上汇报这些情况。区干部问他们调剂股调剂了些什么？该村村长说不知道。指导员说是调剂技术哩！但紧接着又改反说我们每组出一人，是组织了一个技术指导股。区干部又问指导什么技术？李金水说是指导哪一块黄了就先割哪一块。根据该村汇报结果，互助全是形式，生产自流，对如何领导收耕及妇女参加上地等情况，什么也没谈出。李金水领导的一个互助小组，共两户二个劳力，而他自己担任是正式组长，也没谈出具体活动情况。这些干部的领导作风，严重的存在着形式主义，并编造假报告，他们认为开会有个说的交代了上级就算。
