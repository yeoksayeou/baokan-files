Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th—According to various reports: Chen Lifu, the CC clique boss and vice president of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan, who was sent abroad by the bandit Chiang on May 31st, returned to Nanjing on September 14th. Ostensibly, Chen went to Philadelphia in the United States to participate in the so-called "World Moral Re-Armament Conference," but in reality, his mission was to represent the bandit Chiang in the United States to observe the situation before the US election, to curry favor in advance with the new masters, the Republican Party, who might take the stage next year, and to beg the masters for further assistance. During his three-month journey, he spent most of his time in the United States. The bandit Chen paid homage in the US to the Republican Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates Dewey and Warren, Dulles (Dewey's foreign policy advisor), Vandenberg (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Speaker, a key figure in the Republican Party), Taft (Chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee), Bridges (Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Republican), and notorious warmongers Bullitt, McCormick, Luce, as well as Truman, Marshall, Forrestal (US Secretary of Defense), and Wedemeyer (Director of US Operations Planning). Chen held Chiang Kai-shek's "letters of introduction" when he visited Dewey, Vandenberg, and Taft. In addition, Chen also visited Canada, Britain, and France during the three months.

Although Chen reported to the pseudo-Legislative Yuan on the 22nd of this month, shamelessly boasting about his begging for the American masters, according to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 16th, Chen Lifu admitted that the American reactionaries expressed "widespread disappointment" with this Chiang Kai-shek group that only knows how to lose battles.

　　陈立夫赴美乞援返抵南京
    在美曾朝拜共和党头子
    预先讨好明年可能登台的新主人
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据各方消息报导：五月三十一日奉蒋贼命令出国的ＣＣ头子伪立法院副院长陈立夫，已于九月十四日返抵南京。陈在名义上是赴美国费城参加所谓“世界道德重整运动大会”，但实际上其任务系代表蒋贼在美国大选前赴美观望风色，预先讨好其可能在明年登台的新主人共和党，乞讨主子进一步的援助。他在三个多月的行程中，曾以大部分时间逗留美国。陈匪在美曾朝拜美国共和党正副总统候选人杜威、华伦、杜勒斯（杜威外交政策顾问）、范登堡（参院外交委员会主席兼议长、共和党要角）、塔夫脱（参院劳工委员会主席，共和党政策委员会主席）、勃里奇（参院拨款委员会主席，共和党）及著名战争贩子布立特、麦考密克、鲁斯及杜鲁门、马歇尔、福莱斯特尔（美国防部长）、魏德迈（美作战计划处长）等人。陈匪访杜威、范登堡及塔夫脱时，均持有蒋介石的“介绍信”。此外，陈匪在三个多月时间中，并曾前往加拿大、英、法等国。
    陈匪归国后，虽曾于本月二十二日在伪立法院报告中为此行乞怜美国主子作“丑表功”，但据美联社南京十六日电透露，陈立夫承认：美国反动派对于这个只会吃败仗的蒋介石集团表示“普遍的失望”。
