　　Taihang Office Winter School Experience
    Chang Jianghe
    In order to better carry out this year's winter school movement, I have compiled and introduced the past experiences of Taihang in running winter schools for reference by various regions.
    Must be Combined with Central Work
    According to the winter school work of Linxian, Lingchuan, Wuxiang, Shexian, Licheng, Heshun, Pingshun, and the First Special District in the past years, there is a common feature, that is, the organizational form and curriculum content are all carried out in conjunction with the central work under unified leadership. The central work of various regions and periods is the central content of the winter school. All regions regard winter school as a place to promote central work, and winter school education is called the "locomotive" of central work, the "discussion meeting" of central work, and the "deliberation hall" of the common people, which has become an indispensable part of the masses' lives. Experience has proved that regions that do this can not only promote the rapid development of central work, but also make the cultural work itself develop smoothly. For example, the leading comrades of the central work in Licheng and other places not only pay attention to organizing the propaganda and education forces of various systems and making specific work arrangements, but also personally create experience to demonstrate, so that the central work and social education work have made remarkable achievements. Some places only emphasize one aspect, making the two isolated from each other, which often leads to contradictions and causes losses to the work. Therefore, the phenomenon of winter school being disconnected from the central work must be overcome.
    Organizational Form and Activities Should Adapt to the Masses' Living Habits
    The successful winter schools in various regions are also based on the scattered rural conditions and other actual conditions, and are combined with production. For example, in large villages or scattered villages, because the forms of production are diverse, everyone has established small winter schools divided by areas. This form appeared in the old liberated areas with a production base such as Licheng, Wuxiang, and Shexian after overcoming the formalism atmosphere after the rectification movement in 1943. By the end of 1946, according to the statistics of 1,139 administrative villages in 17 counties including Heshun, there were 2,720 winter schools, of which 1,063 were small winter schools, accounting for about 40% of the total number of winter schools, achieving almost two winter schools in one administrative village. Secondly, in the form of combining production, some workshops sent representatives to winter schools to attend classes, and returned to the workshops to teach as teachers, or cadres went to the workshops to conduct in-depth education. In addition, there are various forms of learning groups and meal market propaganda for various industries and trades, and mutual aid groups, which are both universal and in-depth, and are especially loved by the masses. For example, recently, in order to save electricity costs, women in Xingtai City voluntarily combined piece by piece and worked together. The Xingtai Civil Education Center has paid attention to studying this combination form and appropriately combined it for education. In terms of teaching methods, it also adapts to the masses' living habits, breaking the infusion-style teaching of teachers lecturing and students listening, and replacing it with small and large group discussions to solve ideological problems. The teacher plays the role of enlightening, inducing and comprehensively improving. As for the responsibility of the leaders, it is to understand the thoughts of the masses, grasp the progress of the movement according to the requirements of the movement; especially to turn the living facts of the masses into vivid teaching materials. For example, the Allegro textbooks of Lu Defu in Zanhuang, the "Taking Action is the Textbook" in Beiliu Village, Licheng, etc., closely linked our work requirements, the thoughts and actions of the masses, and truly turned it into a conscious movement of the masses. Therefore, many vagrants have been transformed and have become active producers. This is all the result of combining production, adapting to the living habits of the masses, and following the mass line; otherwise, the winter school will not be run well. Even if it is reluctantly set up, it will be an administrative order, formalism, and a winter school that is divorced from the masses. It will inevitably be artificially vigorous at the beginning, and then less and less, until there are teachers but no students, and it will be abandoned halfway.
    Rural Mass Cultural Institutions Should Cooperate with the Winter School Movement
    Mass blackboards, radio stations, rural theater troupes, reading groups, communication groups, youth supplementary classes, and other mass cultural organizations in the village were mostly closely integrated with winter schools and folk schools in the past. They have played a great role in promoting the central work and cooperating with winter schools, and many models have emerged, such as the propaganda and encouragement work of Beiliu Village, Licheng in the production movement; the propaganda and encouragement work of Yuanqu Village, Shexian in the Great Production Movement and the Great Grain Transportation; the Daopeng'an Rural Theater Troupe that emerged in Linxian in the liberation movement; The achievements of the board people in Weizi Town, Lucheng, and the cultural construction of Dajing Village, Huguan, are all very prominent. Their experience proves that whether in organizational leadership or in propaganda and education content, it should be combined with the ideological education of the masses. According to the statistics of 4,862 administrative villages in 12 counties and cities including Lincheng, Lucheng, Heshun, Changzhi, Yushe, Licheng, Gaoyi, Lingchuan, Zanhuang, Xingtai, Xingtai City, and Yuanshi in September 1947, there were 794 rural theater troupes, averaging one troupe for every six villages. Secondly, many reading groups, communication groups, and youth supplementary classes have also been established. However, since the second half of last year, due to the relaxation of leadership, rural mass cultural work has been in a state of stagnation and drifting. Therefore, when we launch the winter school movement this year, we must first pay attention to the restoration and rectification of rural mass cultural institutions, so that they can cooperate with the winter school movement and better serve the central work.
    Winter School Literacy Education
    The literacy education of the masses has also achieved some results in recent years. For example, youth supplementary classes have been generally established in most areas. According to statistics from Wuxiang in 1947, there were a total of 420 youth supplementary classes in the county, with 6,207 participants, of which 1,322 were young women and 2,885 were young men. Among the 98 students in the Hezhuang Youth Supplementary Class in Neiqiu, after one year of study, 6 people knew 1,000 characters, 8 people knew 500 characters, and the lowest also knew 200 characters. Xingtai City used young teachers to deliver character cards, and in half a year, 320 young men and 350 young women became literate. There are also children's small winter schools in Taicun, Shexian, and women's literacy classes in Dongcheng Village that use young teachers to teach. Taicun, with about 1,000 households, has established eight or nine small winter schools scattered around. It is not only convenient to gather, but also to discuss issues and become literate in depth, which is a good way to eliminate illiteracy in large towns. In particular, the mass-based public blackboard created by Beiliu Village, Licheng, is combined with cultural classes, teaching everyone how to write manuscripts, and specifically helping to revise manuscripts and correct typos; the cadre learning group is combined with current affairs education and cultural learning, and the youth supplementary class students help each other write letters, and let teachers revise letters, etc., which breaks the phenomenon of lack of confidence among the masses who have learned the characters but cannot use them in time, and cannot learn them in time when using them. The cultural level of the masses has been directly improved from practical actions. Zhang Yuxing (male), Liu Sanchong (female), Zhang Shuangying (female) and other ten young people from Beiliu Village, Licheng, became correspondents for the village's public blackboard newspaper and the county's small newspaper. For example, the sleeve badges and literacy cards in Wuxiang and other places, the midday reading and night classes in Lucheng and other places, the organization of reading groups, couplet groups, and literacy groups according to cultural level in Cheyuan Village, Licheng, and the literacy cooperatives in Pingshun and other places are all very good experiences and methods. However, in the past, there was also formalism in literacy education. Instead of focusing on teaching young people first, it was for all men, women, old and young in the village, and comprehensive requirements were made; instead of focusing on the actual effect of cultural education, it was often circling in fancy forms, and the result was that they went to winter school every year, but were illiterate every year. This year, the target of literacy education, in addition to adapting to the general cultural requirements of the masses, is mainly placed on young men and women. Moreover, it is carried out by finding people who have a foundation in their work, and have the conditions and willingness to learn culture after the masses have turned over. Special attention should be paid to village cadres and young men and women who have already recognized several hundred characters, so as to continue to improve and carry out effective key literacy work, and create experience for large-scale literacy work in the future.

　　太行办冬学经验
    常江河
    为很好的开展今年冬学运动，特将过去太行举办冬学的经验汇集介绍供各地参考。
    必须结合中心工作
    根据林县、陵川、武乡、涉县、黎城、和顺、平顺以及一专区等地历年来的冬学工作，有一个共同的特点，即组织形式与课程内容都是在一元化的领导下，结合着中心工作进行的。各地各时期的中心工作，即是冬学的中心内容。各地把冬学看成推动中心工作的场所，把冬学教育称为中心工作的“火车头”，中心工作的“讨论会”，老百姓的“议事厅”，成了群众生活中不可缺少的一部分。经验证明，凡这样做的地区，不但能推动中心工作迅速得到开展，而且也使文化工作本身得到了顺利发展。如黎城等地中心工作领导同志不但注意组织各系统宣教力量与具体安排工作，而且能亲自动手，创造经验来示范，使中心工作与社教工作都做出显著成绩。某些地方只强调一面，使两者孤立起来，就常常发生矛盾，使工作受到损失。因此必须克服冬学与中心工作脱节的现象。
    组织形式与活动方法要适应群众生活习惯
    各地成功的冬学，又都是根据分散的农村条件及其他实际情况，并结合着生产来进行的。如在大村或分散的村庄，因生产形式多种多样，大家就都建立了按片划分的小冬学。这种形式在一九四三年整风运动后克服形式主义的空气下，在黎城、武乡、涉县等生产有基础的老区，就出现了。至一九四六年年关，根据和顺等十七个县一千一百三十九个行政村的统计，有两千七百二十个冬学，内小冬学一千零六十三个，约占冬学全数的百分之四十，做到了差不多一个行政村有两个冬学。其次在结合生产的形式上，有的作坊派代表到冬学听课，回作坊当先生传授，或干部分头到作坊深入教育。此外还有各业各行的学习组及饭市宣传，互助组酝酿等形式，既普遍，又深入，群众特别喜欢。再如近来邢台市妇女群众为了节省电灯费，一片一片的自愿结合起，在一块作活，这个结合形式，邢市民教馆已注意研究，适当结合进行教育。在教学方法上，也是适应着群众的生活习惯，打破了先生讲学生听的注入式教学，代之以大小组讨论，解决思想问题的民教民办法。教者起着启发诱导综合提高作用。至于领导者的责任，是了解群众思想，根据运动要求，掌握运动前进；特别是把群众活的事实变成生动的教材。如一分区赞皇吕德付的快板教材，黎城北流村的“行动起来就是教材”等，把我们的工作要求、群众的思想与行动，紧密的连在一起，真正变成了群众的自觉运动。因此好多二流子得到了改造，而且成了生产积极分子。这都是因为结合了生产，适应了群众生活习惯，走了群众路线的结果；否则冬学便办不好。就是勉强搞起来，也会是行政命令、形式主义、脱离群众的冬学。必然是开始人为的轰轰烈烈，后来越来越少，终至有教员没学生，半途而废。
    农村大众文化机构要与冬学运动配合
    村里的大众黑板、广播台、农村剧团、读报组、通讯组、青补班等大众文化组织机构，以往大部和冬学民校密切结合着。在推动中心工作与冬学配合上，起了很大作用，出现了许多典型，如黎城北流村在生产运动中的宣传鼓励工作；涉县垣曲村在大生产运动中和大运粮中的宣传鼓励工作；林县在翻身运动中涌现的道棚庵农村剧团；潞城微子镇等地的板人以及壶关大井村的文化建设等，成绩都很突出。他们的经验证明，不论在组织领导上，宣教内容上，都应与群众思想教育相结合。据一九四七年九月临城、潞城、和顺、长治、榆社、黎城、高邑、陵川、赞皇、邢台、邢市、元氏等十二个县市四千八百六十二个行政村的统计，有农村剧团七百九十四个，每六个村平均一个剧团。其次，读报组、通讯组、青补班，也建立的不少。但自去年后半年以来，由于领导放松，使农村大众文化工作处于停顿和自流状态。所以我们在今年开展冬学运动时，首先要注意农村大众文化机构的恢复整顿工作，使之配合着冬学运动，很好的服务于中心工作。
    冬学识字教育
    群众的识字教育，这几年来也有些成绩。如青补班在大部地区普遍建立。据武乡一九四七年统计，全县共有四百二十个青补班，参加人数为六千二百零七个，其中女青年就占了千三百二十二人，男青年有二千八百八十五人。内邱和庄青补班九十八人中，经一年学习，有六人识一千字，八人识五百字，最低的也识二百字。邢台城运用小先生送字牌，半年中男青年识字三百二十个，女青年识字三百五十个。还有涉县台村的儿童小冬学，东成村的利用小先生教课的妇女识字班等。一千户左右的台村，分散建立了八九个小冬学。既便于集合，又能深入讨论问题和识字，是扫除大村镇文盲的一个好办法。特别是黎城北流村创造的群众性办大众黑板与文化课相结合，教大家怎样写稿，具体帮助修稿改错别字；干部学习组与时事教育、文化学习相结合，以及青补班学员的互助写信，让教师改信等办法，打破了群众中存在的学了字及时用不上，用字时又及时学不上的没信心现象。从实际行动中直接提高了群众的文化水平。黎城北流张玉兴（男）、刘三虫（女）、张双英（女）等十个青年，当了村大众黑板报、县小报的通讯员。再如武乡等地的袖章识字卡片，潞城等地的午读、夜班，黎城车元村的按文化程度组织读报组、联句组、识字组，平顺等地的识字合作社，都是很好的经验与办法。但过去在识字教育上也存在着有形式主义，不是有重点的先教青年，而是全村男女老少一齐来，全面要求；不是从文化教育实际效果上着眼，而是常在花样翻新的形式上打圈子，结果是年年上冬学，年年不识字。今年要求识字教育的对象，除适应一般群众文化要求外，主要放在男女青年上。而且是找工作有基础、在群众翻身后有文化学习的要求与自愿的条件下去进行。特别要注意已经识了几百字的村干部与青年男女，给以继续提高，进行有效的重点扫除文盲，为将来大规模扫除文盲创造经验。
