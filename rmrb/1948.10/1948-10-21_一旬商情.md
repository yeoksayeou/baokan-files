　　A Ten-Day Market Report
    September 28th to October 8th
    Data Room of the North China Trading Corporation
    Since the liberation of Jinan, the exchange of materials between the East China and North China regions has been unimpeded. Consequently, prices in the eastern plains generally showed active increases over the past ten days. In the western mountainous areas, because the masses were still busy with the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and had no time to attend to transportation, the exchange of goods in various places was disrupted, and prices generally showed fatigue and decline or mixed ups and downs. In neighboring liberated areas, the autumn harvest has mostly been completed recently, with good harvests, and prices generally show a downward trend, except for cotton cloth, which has risen slightly due to seasonal factors. In contrast, in the Chiang-occupied areas, since the so-called "currency reform" (which is essentially a massive plunder of the people in the occupied areas) and the appearance of "gold yuan notes" (which is essentially massive inflation), despite the bandit authorities' constant "measures" and "decrees," they have not been able to save their economic crisis, but only hasten its economic collapse. Moreover, due to the recent series of defeats of the bandit troops and the loss of Jinan, the economic impact has been enormous, and prices in major cities in the Chiang area have been greatly shaken. Furthermore, due to the depletion of materials and the intensifying panic buying, the market dares not conduct open transactions, the black market is becoming increasingly rampant, and prices are soaring. According to reports: in the Tianjin black market from September 32nd to October 3rd, grain and flour prices increased by more than one and a half times. This deteriorating situation is continuing to develop. The specific price situation in the liberated areas and the Chiang-occupied areas this ten-day period is reported separately below:
    Grain
    In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, grain is active and prices are rising in southern Hebei. Rice and wheat in Puyang rose by 5% to 8%. Millet and corn in Linqing rose by 25% to 30%, and red sorghum rose by 13.2%. Millet and red sorghum in Handan rose by 12%, and corn rose by 20%. In central Hebei, except for the northeast border area, where prices remain high due to the influence of rising grain prices in the enemy-occupied areas, most other areas have turned downward. In Xinji, Duancun, Wurenqiao and other places, the average price of millet has fallen by 20% in the past ten days, wheat has fallen by 5% to 8%, and miscellaneous grains have fallen by 3% to 5%. In Shijiazhuang City, the source of grain has become smoother in the past ten days, and prices have remained stable. However, black beans have arrived in large quantities, so they have fallen by 16%. In Jinzhong Yuci, the market is also flooded with grain, and millet has fallen by 25%, but wheat has risen by 11% because more people in the city eat noodles. In Taihang and Taiyue, the amount of new grain entering the market is increasing daily, forming an oversupply, and prices are falling. Millet in Changzhi fell by 6%, wheat fell by 21%, millet in Jincheng fell by 23%, corn fell by 9.5%, miscellaneous grains in Yicheng fell by 11%. Grain prices in various parts of the North Yue area fluctuated, with rice, wheat and beans in Laiyuan rising by 25-119 yuan per catty, and millet in Hunyuan falling by 950 yuan per dou. Millet in Yangquan once soared by 30%, but has now recovered. In the neighboring liberated areas of Bohai and Jin Sui, this year's harvests were relatively abundant, and grain prices were generally stable or falling. From September 30th to October 3rd in Dezhou, wheat fell by 10 yuan per catty, corn fell by 20 yuan, and millet remained stable. From September 22nd to 27th in Daixian, millet fell by 0.5%, but wheat rose by 10% due to the lack of goods in the area, which is not a wheat-producing area. In the Chiang-occupied city of Tianjin, from September 30th to October 3rd, millet in the black market rose by 18%, and flour rose by 98%.
    The following is a comparison of grain prices in major markets in the Chiang-occupied areas and neighboring liberated areas this ten-day period:

    Note: 1. Currency: The enemy area is calculated in bandit gold yuan notes; Dezhou is calculated in North Coin; Daixian is calculated in West Farmer Coin; Luoyang is calculated in Zhongzhou Coin (the highest value, one yuan is equivalent to 40 Jichaos); the North China Liberated Area is calculated in Jichaos.
    2. Unit: Tianjin and Dezhou are calculated in jin (catty). The rest are calculated in dou (bushel).
    Cotton
    This ten-day period, the cotton trend followed the rise and fall of grain, but its rate of rise and fall was less than that of grain. Looking at the exchange ratio of cotton and grain in southern Hebei, in late September, one jin of cotton was equal to 6.83 jin of millet, and in early October it was 5.31 jin. In central Hebei, rice was also more expensive than cotton. Cotton sales: cotton from southern Hebei sells well in Jiaodong, and part of it flows south, so the market in southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan is active and prices are rising. Handan rose by 29%, and Linqing and Nangong rose by an average of 15%. In the central and southeastern parts of central Hebei, more cotton comes from southern Hebei (and more goes from Nangong), and prices are falling. Xinji and Wurenqiao fell by 50-200 yuan per catty. In the northeast border area, affected by the rise in cotton prices in the enemy-occupied area, Cangxian rose by 1,000 yuan per catty. The stock of cotton in Shijiazhuang City is abundant, and the price is stable. Taihang, Taiyue, North Yue, and Jinzhong are similar to the grain situation, and also show mixed ups and downs. Changzhi is flat, Xingtai rose by 200 yuan, Jincheng rose by 200 yuan, Hunyuan fell by 350 yuan, and Yuci fell by 400 yuan. In the cotton market in the neighboring liberated areas, due to seasonal reasons, the number of people buying cotton has increased, and prices have risen significantly. Daixian rose by 14%, and Dezhou rose by 40 yuan per catty.
    Homespun Cloth
    In the past ten days, homespun cloth has sold well in Jiaodong. Generally, the market is active and prices are rising in cloth-producing areas. Linqing rose by 70 yuan per chi (foot), Handan rose by 7 yuan, and Puyang Nangong rose by 10 yuan. In other areas, affected by the rise and fall of cotton and grain, there were also mixed ups and downs. Duancun Wurenqiao in central Hebei fell by 25 yuan per chi. New Shanlu brand foreign cloth in Shijiazhuang rose by 2,000 yuan per bolt. In the North Yue area, because the weather is colder, more and more people are buying cloth to prepare winter clothes, so the price of cloth has risen significantly. Laiyuan Hunyuan rose by 60-66 yuan per chi. In Jinzhong Yuci, the price of homespun cloth fell by 80 yuan due to the cheap price of foreign cloth. Taihang is stable, and Taiyue generally fell. Jincheng, Guodao, Yicheng and other places fell by 64-77 yuan per chi.
    Vegetable Oil
    This year, the planting area of oil crops in the north and south of North China is large, and the output is also abundant, so oil prices have tended to be depressed since the beginning of autumn. From early August to now (early October), the average oil price in the whole region has fallen by 14%, and the largest drop has reached 33%. It is estimated that when the busy farming season is over and transportation is developed, it may become active.
    Edible Salt
    The East and West of our North China Liberated Area are rich in salt production. Since the liberation of Jinan, the East Salt (Bohai) has been selling smoothly in the West, and the market is active and prices are rising. Various places in central and southern Hebei are rising, rising by 15-25 yuan per catty. However, Luyan in the West is calm and the price is flat due to the current busy farming season and unsmooth transportation.
    Foreign Goods
    After the liberation of Jinan, the increase in materials and the smooth source of various groceries, and because public and private merchants went to Jinan to raise funds to purchase new goods, they sold more of their old stock, causing various groceries to fall, especially alkaline noodles, which fell the most. Bozhen fell by 1,000 yuan per catty, and Cangxian fell by 230 yuan, but matches rose by 50-100 yuan per pack in southern Hebei.

　　一旬商情
    九月二十八日至十月八日
    华北贸易总公司资料室
    从济南解放以后，华东、华北两区物资交流畅行无阻，因之旬来东部平原地区物价一般呈现活跃上升；西边山岳地区因群众仍忙于秋收和种麦无暇顾及运输，故各地物资交流失常，物价一般表现平疲下落或涨落参差。友邻解放区，近来秋收大部已毕，收成尚好，物价一般呈现下降，惟棉布因季节关系稍显抬头。反观蒋占区，从所谓“币制改革”（实质上是对统治区人民的大掠夺）“金元券”出现（实质上是通货大膨胀）以来，尽管匪当局左一个“措施”又一个“法令”，然而并不能挽救其经济危机，只有促其经济早日崩溃。更由于近来匪军们连吃败仗，济南市的丧失，在经济上影响极大，蒋区各大城市的物价大为动荡。又由于物资枯竭抢购争买风潮日炽，市场不敢公开交易，黑市益加猖狂，各物飞涨。据息：天津黑市九月卅二日至十月三日，粮食面粉上涨一倍半多，这种恶化的局势正在继续发展中。兹将本旬解放区及蒋区物价具体情况分别报导于下：
    粮食
    冀鲁豫，冀南粮食活跃价升，濮阳米麦升百分之五至八。临清小米玉米升百分之二十五至三十，红粮升百分之十三·二。邯郸小米红粮升百分之十二，玉米升百分之二十。冀中，除东北边沿一带因受敌区粮价上涨影响价仍尖挺外，其他大部地区转趋回落。辛集、端村、伍仁桥等地旬来小米平均下跌百分之二十，小麦跌百分之五至八，杂粮跌百分之三至五，石庄市旬来粮食来源转顺，价格持平。惟黑豆来货较多，则下跌百分之十六，晋中榆次粮食上市亦涌，小米下跌百分之二十五，惟小麦因城市食面者较多，则升百分之十一。太行太岳目前新粮上市日增，形成供过于求，价呈下降。长治小米跌百分之六，小麦跌百分之二十一，晋城小米跌百分之二十三，玉米跌百分之九·五，翼城杂粮跌百分之十一，北岳区各地粮食涨落参差，涞源米、麦、豆每斤上涨二五——一一九元，浑源小米每斗下跌九五○元，阳泉小米一度猛涨到百分之三十，现已平复。友邻解放区渤海、晋绥、本年收成较丰，粮价一般平稳或下降，德州九月三十日至十月三日，小麦每斤下跌一○元，玉米跌二○元，小米持平。代县九月二十二日至二十七日小米跌百分之○·五，惟小麦因该处非产麦区货缺价升百分之十，蒋占天津市九月三十日至十月三日，暗市小米涨百分之十八，面粉涨百分之九十八。
    本旬蒋区及邻近解放区主要市场粮价比较如下：将区面粉　　　黑豆　　　红粮　　　玉米　　　小麦　　　小米天津 １８．　——　　——　０．２１６　——　０．４３邻近解放区

    注：１、货币：敌区以匪金元券计；德州北币计；代县西农币计；洛阳中州币（价值最高一元顶冀钞四十元）计；华北解放区以冀钞计。
    ２、单位：天津、德州以市斤计。其余均以市斗计。
    棉花
    本旬棉势，是尾随粮食的涨落而升降，但其涨跌率较逊于粮食，以冀南棉粮交换比例来看，九月下旬斤花等于小米六·八三斤，十月上旬则为五·三一斤，在冀中方面也表现米昂于棉。棉花销路：冀南棉花畅销胶东，并部分南流，故冀南冀鲁豫行情活跃价提，邯郸上升百分之二九，临清、南宫平均涨百分之十五，冀中中部及东南部冀南花来多（南宫去的多），价逞下降。辛集、伍仁桥每斤跌五○——二○○元，东北边沿地带因受敌区棉涨的影响，沧县每斤上涨一○○○元，石庄市棉花存量丰富，价持平稳，太行、太岳、北岳、晋中，略同粮食情况，亦表现涨落参差，长治平，邢台升二○○元，晋城升二○○元，浑源跌三五○元，榆次跌四○○元。友邻解放区棉市，因季节关系群众购买者增多，价显上升，代县上涨百分之十四，德市每斤升四○元。
    土布
    旬来土布畅销胶东，一般产布地区行情活跃价升，临清每尺上涨七○元，邯郸升七元，濮阳南宫升一○元，另外些地区，因受棉粮涨落之影响亦表现涨落参差，冀中端村伍仁桥每尺跌二五元，石庄新山鹿牌洋布每匹上升二○○○元，北岳区因气候较冷，群众购布备置冬衣者日多，布价则显上升，涞源浑源每尺升六○——六六元，晋中榆次土布因洋布价廉的影响价跌八○元，太行平稳，太岳普遍下跌，晋城、郭道、翼城等地每尺下跌六四——七七元。
    植物油
    本年我华北南北各区，油料种植面积较广，产量亦丰，故油价自入秋以来趋于消沉，从八月上旬到现在（十月上旬）全区油价平均下跌百分之十四，跌率最大者已达百分之三十三，估计农忙季节过去，运输开展，可能活跃。
    食盐
    我华北解放区东西两地盐产丰富，从济南解放后，东盐（渤海）西销畅顺，行情活跃价升，冀中冀南各地均逞上涨，每斤升一五——二五元不等，但西边潞盐，因目前农忙，运销不畅行情沉静、价平。
    外来品
    济南解放后，物资的增加，各种杂货来源畅顺，并因公私商家为措款赴济（南）采办新货，故多推售旧存货，造成各种杂货下跌，尤以碱面为最，泊镇每斤下跌一○○○元，沧县跌二三○元，惟火柴在冀南方面每包上涨五○——一○○元。
