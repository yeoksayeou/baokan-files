　　Ma Yanxiang Arrives in Shijiazhuang
    Drama and Music Circles of Shijiazhuang Hold Tea Party to Welcome Him

    ★The famous playwright Mr. Ma Yanxiang recently arrived in Shijiazhuang. The drama and music circles of Shijiazhuang held a welcome tea party, with over 50 representatives from various organizations attending. Comrade Wu Liren, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a welcome speech. Following this, Mr. Ma spoke, pointing out the reasons for the decline of drama in the KMT-controlled areas: primarily, the adverse political environment, the wide gap between old dramas and the people's real life, coupled with excessively heavy taxes and various disturbances by soldiers, made it impossible for theaters to operate. Naturally, the lack of unity among the old artists themselves was also a factor. He also talked about his experience in reforming old dramas. Finally, Comrade Huang Mei, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, announced that Shijiazhuang would re-establish a Drama and Music Work Committee to uniformly lead new and old art activities in drama, music, and acrobatics in Shijiazhuang, with Ma Yanxiang and Zhou Weizhi in charge.

　　马彦祥抵石家庄市
    石市戏剧音乐界茶会欢迎
    ★名戏剧家马彦祥先生日前抵达石家庄市，石市戏剧音乐界举行欢迎茶会，到会各团体代表五十余人。市委宣传部部长吴立人同志致欢迎词后，接着马先生讲话，他指出蒋区戏剧没落的原因：主要是政治环境恶劣，旧剧与人民现实生活距离太远，再加上捐税奇重和军人种种滋扰，使戏院无法营业；自然旧艺人本身不团结也是原因。他还谈到改造旧剧工作的经验。最后市委宣传部副部长荒煤同志宣布石市将重新成立戏剧音乐工作委员会，统一领导石市戏剧音乐杂技新旧艺术活动，并由马彦祥、周巍峙负责。
