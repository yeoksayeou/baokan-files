Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th. The first political work conference of the East China Military Region, which opened on July 16th, concluded successfully on August 12th, lasting a total of 28 days. More than 100 representatives attended, including responsible cadres for political work at all levels and political work cadres from the company and platoon level, as well as Comrade Huang Zhen from the General Political Department. The conference, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on how to conduct cadre meetings, adopted the mass line method of combining leadership enlightenment with free discussion, and combining general meetings with small meetings. In addition to dividing all representatives into many groups, three major research groups were organized for company-level work, organizational work, and urban policy. In addition, responsible cadres were designated to organize three special committees to lead the major groups in conducting research on various specialized issues. In more than 20 days, the conference resolved several major issues in current political work, such as the summary of new-style rectification experience, Party committee leadership, work of the branch and Revolutionary Soldiers Committee, urban policies and discipline, cadre and organizational work, and enemy army work.

During the study of new-style rectification experience, branch work, and the Soldiers Committee, the conference engaged in heated debates. Should the new-style rectification movement be regarded as a mass movement of class consciousness or as a movement to raise class consciousness? The debate resulted in the following unified understanding: New-style rectification is a led and orderly democratic mass movement with the main purpose of raising the class consciousness of the troops. The most prolonged debate was on the nature of the branch, with the focus on whether the implementation of the branch committee as the highest leading body in the company would hinder the "chief officer system" and military command. The result was unanimous that making the branch committee the highest leading body of the company and realizing the absolute leadership of the Party is appropriate and possible, because it can better concentrate will, unify thought and action, and overcome various tendencies, so as to enhance the combativeness and centralization of the company; it not only does not hinder the "chief officer system" but also recognizes and consolidates the "chief officer system," but unlike the past, it places the "chief officer system" under the collective leadership of the higher-level Party committee and the company branch committee. As for military command, the branch committee not only does not disperse the will to command but also helps and strengthens the ability and determination of the commander, and fully guarantees the completion of combat missions. The military commander still has the power of discretionary command, but he is responsible to the higher-level Party committee and the branch committee, and executes all resolutions of the Party committee (branch). In addition, the conference also conducted heated research on the Party committee, organizational system, company work, and urban policies, and reached preliminary conclusions, some of which have been made into draft regulations and sent to the General Political Department for review.

After listening to and discussing typical reports on various specialized issues and speeches by the special committees, Political Commissar Rao of the Military Region gave a situation report, reviewing the East China war situation over the past two years and pointing out that East China has two major tasks in the future: war (including support for the front) and construction. Under this general task, Director Shu put forward six central tasks for political work in the future: First, continue to implement and adhere to the new-style rectification movement; Second, strengthen the troops' policy concept and discipline concept, and cooperate with local land reform work and production work; Third, massively cultivate and promote cadres, and ensure the replenishment of main forces; Fourth, prepare to handle the work of a large number of prisoners of war; Fifth, strengthen the political work of logistics; Sixth, strengthen wartime political work in field troops and gradually improve the departmental work of political organs.

　　华东军区召开政工会议
    依据中央指示开干部会的方法进行
    解决新式整军党委领导等重大问题
    【新华社华东三十日电】华东军区第一届政工会议，自七月十六日开幕，共历时二十八天，于八月十二日胜利结束。与会代表有各级政工负责干部及营、连政工干部共一百余人，并有总政治部黄镇同志参加。会议根据中央指示如何开干部会的精神，采用领导启发与自由讨论结合、大会与小会相结合的群众路线的方法进行。除将全体代表编为许多小组外，并组织了连队工作、组织工作、城市政策三个大研究组，此外又指定负责干部组织三个专门委员会，分别领导各大组进行各项专门问题的研究。大会在二十余天中解决了当前政治工作中的几个主要问题，如新式整军经验总结，党委领导，支部与革命军人委员会工作，城市政策与纪律，干部与组织工作，敌军工作等重大问题。
    大会在研究新式整军经验、支部工作及军人委员会等问题中，曾展开热烈辩论。新式整军运动应该看作群众的阶级自觉运动呢？或是为了提高阶级觉悟呢？这个争论，结果达到了如下的统一认识：新式整军是一个有领导、有秩序的民主的群众运动，以提高部队阶级觉悟为其主要目的。争论最久的是支部性质问题，焦点在于：实施支部委员会为连队最高领导机关是否会妨碍“首长制”与军事指挥？结果一致认为：使支委会成为连队最高领导机关，实现党的绝对领导，是应当的与可能的，因为他更能集中意志，统一思想与行动，克服各种倾向，以增强连队的战斗性与集中性；他不仅不妨碍“首长制”，而且承认与巩固“首长制”，但与过去不同的是把“首长制”置于上级党委与连队支部委员会集体领导下进行工作。至于军事指挥，支委会不仅不分散指挥意志，而且帮助与加强指挥员的能力与决心，全力保证战斗任务完成。军事指挥员仍有其机断专行的指挥权力，但他要对上级党委与支部委员会负责，执行党委（支部）一切决议。此外，大会在党委、组织制度、连队工作及城市政策上，也都展开热烈研究，并获得初步结论，有的已制成条例草案，送总政审核。
    大会在听取与讨论了各项专门问题的典型报告及各专门委员会的发言后，由军区饶政委作一次形势报告，检讨两年来华东战局，指出华东今后有两大任务，即战争（包括支前）与建设。在此总任务下，舒主任提出了今后政治工作的六项中心任务：第一、继续贯彻、坚持新式整军运动；第二、加强部队的政策观念，纪律观念，配合地方土改工作与生产工作；第三、大量培养与提拔干部，并保证主力兵源的补充；第四、准备处理大量俘虏的工作；第五、加强后勤政治工作；第六、加强野战部队战时政治工作，并逐渐健全政治机关的部门工作。
