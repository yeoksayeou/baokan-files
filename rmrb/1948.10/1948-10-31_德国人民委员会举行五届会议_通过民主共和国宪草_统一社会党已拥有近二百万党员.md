　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th Dispatch from TASS: The German People's Committee held its fifth session in Berlin on the 22nd, discussing the draft constitution of the German Democratic Republic. The meeting was opened by the Chairman of the People's Committee, Pieck. After the Chairman of the Constitutional Drafting Committee, Grotewohl, presented a report on the draft constitution, the People's Committee unanimously voted it through on the 23rd. In its resolution passing the draft, the committee solemnly declared that, as the sole legitimate representative body of the German people, the People's Committee demands the right to realize the free and democratic German Republic established by the German people, and to conclude a peace treaty. To this end, the People's Committee decided to submit the draft constitution to the German people and the Third People's Congress for discussion. The resolution condemned the so-called constitution drafted by the West German separatist parliament in Bonn (in the British zone of West Germany), stating that the purpose of this constitution is only to subject the German people to the occupying authorities, instead of granting the German people the rights and obligations they deserve in accordance with the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions. The resolution called on the German people to wage a resolute struggle for justice and peace, for the withdrawal of occupying forces one year after the conclusion of a peace treaty, and for a unified national constitution and unified administration. Regarding the Berlin issue, the resolution pointed out that, as far as American policy is concerned, the Berlin issue is merely a means for the United States to buy time to prepare for a political, economic, and military offensive by the Western bloc against Eastern Europe. The resolution pointed out that the Berlin issue cannot be resolved in isolation from the entire German question, and that the four occupying powers should resume negotiations and complete them as soon as possible.
　　After the opening of the People's Committee, workers and staff in Berlin universally held meetings in major factories to listen to the speeches of the People's Committee members on the draft constitution issue, expressing satisfaction with the People's Committee's completion of the draft constitution and submitting it to the entire people for discussion.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th Dispatch from TASS: In the struggle for national democratization, the strength of the German people has grown tremendously. The German Socialist Unity Party has nearly two million members, making it the largest party in Germany. The Free German Trade Union Federation has 3.5 million members throughout Germany. In the process of land reform, various farmers' organizations in the Soviet zone of Germany, such as farmers' mutual aid committees and other cooperatives for jointly reclaiming land and marketing agricultural products, have been organized and united the broad masses of working farmers. The Farmers' Mutual Aid Committees alone have 500,000 members, and more than 6,500 farmers' cooperatives have one million members. In addition, the "Free German Youth," established two years ago, has today become a mass organization uniting all progressive German youth. It has a total of approximately 550,000 members, of whom approximately 60,000 are in the Western occupation zones. In the Soviet zone, more than 3,000 of its members have been elected to local representative conferences, and more than 300 have been elected to county and state councils.

　　德国人民委员会举行五届会议
  　通过民主共和国宪草
  　统一社会党已拥有近二百万党员
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社报导：德国人民委员会二十二日在柏林举行第五届会议，讨论德国民主共和国宪法草案。会议由人民委员会主席皮克揭幕。在宪草委员会主席格罗提渥就宪法草案提出报告后，人民委员会已于二十三日一致表决通过。委员会在通过草案的决议中郑重声明，作为德国人民唯一合法的代表机关，人民委员会要求实践由德国人民建立自由民主的德意志共和国及缔结和约的权利。为此，人民委员会决定将宪法草案提交德国人民及第三届人民大会讨论。决议谴责波恩（在西德英战区）西德分裂议会在草拟的所谓宪法称，这一宪法的目的只是为了使德国人民臣属于占领国当局，而不是按照雅尔塔和波茨顿决议给予德国人民应有的权利和义务。决议号召德国人民为争取正义与和平，争取在和约缔结一年后占领国撤退其军队、争取全国统一宪法及统一行政而进行坚决的斗争。论及柏林问题时，决议指出：就美国政策说，柏林问题只是美国用以争取时间以准备西方集团对东欧的政治、经济和军事攻势的手段。决议指出，柏林问题不能脱离整个德国问题解决，占领国四方应恢复商谈，并使其尽速完成。
    在人民委员会开幕以后，柏林工人职员在各大工厂普遍举行集会，听取人民委员会委员关于宪草问题的演说，对人民委员会完成宪法草案并提交全体人民讨论一事表示满意。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社报导：在争取国家民主化的斗争中，德国人民力量已经有了巨大的增长。德国统一社会党已拥有近二百万党员，成了德国第一大党。自由德国工会联合会在全德已拥有三百五十万会员。在土改过程中，德国苏占区的各种农民组织如农民互助委员会及其他共同开垦土地和推销农产品的合作社等，都已在组织起来并团结了广大的劳动农民。单是农民互助委员会就拥有会员五十万人，六千五百多个农民合作社拥有社员一百万人。此外，在两年前成立的“自由德国青年”，今天已经成为联合所有德国进步青年的群众性的组织。它拥有会员共约五十五万人，其中约六万人是在西德占区。在苏占区它的会员有三千余人被选入地方代表会议，三百余人被选入县议会和州议会。
