[Jizhong Electric] The Yonghua Match Company, in accordance with the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, inspected its production management work. It was found that many industrial systems were not thoroughly implemented. For example, after the establishment of the inspection system, the section chiefs, officers, and industrial staff carefully inspected according to standards. Later, they gradually slackened off, doing only cursory inspections, leading to problems such as hurried sand brushing, boxes sticking together, uneven sulfur coating, incorrect placement of chemical heads, and inconsistent thickness of stems, affecting product quality. In terms of attendance, although sick and personal leave were recorded, some were often late or left early. Staff members who ate at home were often tens of minutes late, and some were often more than ten minutes late for work. Moreover, machine downtime due to malfunctions was mostly not recorded. The system for issuing and receiving materials was not strict, and the industrial section lacked control over raw materials, their uses, and quantities, leading to a "must-issue-when-received" mentality, which encouraged waste. For example, the daily usage of lubricant oil was set at three catties, but in August, five catties were used daily. The exchange of old tools and furniture for new ones was also not strictly enforced. The leave-taking system lacked detailed regulations, making it difficult to manage and creating antagonism between those taking leave and the industrial section. Staff members often went out to the streets during working hours without taking leave. Although there had been progress in registration and statistics, there was no serious or accurate record of savings or waste of materials and labor. The industrial section's meeting system was unsound, and it did not pay attention to using meetings to seriously inspect and promote work. In terms of business operations: the purchasing of raw materials was simply "assigning tasks," committing the error of impulsiveness, completing tasks for the sake of completing tasks. Because of insufficient planning and lax management, it failed to grasp seasonality, and a shortage of wood caused the box material department to shut down, suffering a loss of 600,000 yuan. Warehouse management was lax, and fifty knives of paper were lost without anyone knowing. The economic accounting system was not strict, and the use of large amounts of funds was not approved by the manager. Some cadres embezzled the factory's cotton for private trading. Although cost accounting was established, it was not precise or applicable due to a lack of research and improvement. The phenomenon of disorganization was very serious, with purchasing agents who had been out for several months not reporting to the company. Improper capital management had resulted in losses due to excessive savings of currency. The above-mentioned problems have been corrected to some extent, but losses of over 70 million yuan have already been incurred due to the untimely supply of raw materials, the purchase of fake materials, the prolonged inability to purchase raw materials after paying for them, the illegal purchase of vermicelli paper that was confiscated, and the excessive and prolonged savings of currency.

The root cause of these shortcomings is that cadres' thinking lacks a serious sense of responsibility towards the people's wealth and a spirit of painstakingly studying factory work. There is complacency from top to bottom. In addition, the leadership lacks planning and inspection of factory management, simply giving parental-style reminders and inquiries, and not paying attention to the education and assistance of staff and workers. Some staff members do not even know the significance and implementation methods of certain systems. Problems that occurred among the workers were not handled seriously and promptly, rewards and punishments were not clear, and discipline was lax. There was unprincipled accommodation towards cadres who embezzled public cotton for private trading, workers who resisted the production competition movement by repeatedly overstaying their leave, and workers who frequently made mistakes, which fostered the development of a lack of organization and discipline. Because the management method of level-by-level responsibility was not truly implemented, section chiefs were not truly given the right to direct production, and their role was not brought into play. Some were old section chiefs who did not dare to take responsibility and were merely "intermediaries" between the manager, the industrial section, and the workers; others were new section chiefs who were active and responsible but lacked experience. Some workers did not obey the leadership of the section chiefs, affecting production.

After the inspection, the manager, technicians, industrial section, and business section are now studying and formulating work plans for the second half of the year, aiming to improve business management, overcome the phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline, conscientiously implement various systems, establish a system of level-by-level responsibility, lay the foundation for truly enterprise-style management, strengthen technical research, use local products to replace foreign raw materials, improve quality, and further increase current production by 16 percent. Regarding the establishment of the level-by-level responsibility system, it was decided: to specifically assist section chiefs in their work and dispel the concerns of old section chiefs. To educate Party members and workers to obey the command of section chiefs, and to clearly stipulate the powers of section chiefs, who, under the leadership of the manager, will lead workers to complete production tasks and thoroughly implement various systems. To ensure the completion of production tasks, section chiefs have the right to direct and transfer workers within their sections and to handle problems that arise in their work. At the same time, section chiefs should listen to workers' opinions, improve production leadership, and report to the manager on time.

　　永华火柴公司检查生产管理
    克服无组织无纪律
    【冀中电】永华火柴公司，根据华北工商会议精神检查生产管理工作。发现许多工务制度执行很不彻底。如检验制度刚建立后，科、股长、工务员，根据标准，还认真检验；后来逐渐松懈，走马观花，发生刷沙子的贪快，盒子沾到一块，沾磺不匀，药头不正，切梗子粗细不一，影响产品质量。考勤制度上，事假、病假虽有记载，但有的迟到早退，在家吃饭的职员，常迟到几十分钟，有的上班常常晚十余分钟，以及机器因故停工，大都没有登记。领发制度不严格，工务科缺乏对原料、用途、用量的掌握，形成“有领必发”，助长浪费。如滑机油规定每日用三斤，八月份每日用了五斤。工具及家具的交旧领新，也未严格执行。请假制度没规定详细条例，掌握困难，造成请假的与工务科对立。职员在工作时间上街，常不请假。登记统计工作虽有进步，但对材料人工的节约或浪费，没有认真精确登记。工务科的会议制度不健全，没有注意利用会议认真检查和推动工作。在经营工作上：采购原料是光“布置任务”，犯急性病，为完成任务而完成任务。因为计划不够，管理松懈，没有掌握住季节性，缺了木料，使盒料部停工，受六十万元损失。仓库管理不严，丢了五十刀纸也不知道。经济核算制不严格，动用较大数目的资金也不经经理批准，有的干部挪用工厂棉花作私人买卖。虽然建立了成本会计，因为不研究改进，不够精确适用。出去好几个月的采购员，不向公司报帐的无组织现象很严重。资金管理不当，曾因过多的储蓄货币受到损失。以上毛病有的已经纠正，可是因原料供给不及时，或买了假料，拿钱去很久买不回原料来，赊欠、违法购买粉连纸被没收过，与过多过久的储蓄货币，已遭受的损失达七千万元以上。
    这些缺点的根源，是干部思想上对人民财富严肃负责不够，缺乏苦心学习工厂工作的精神。自上到下都有自满情绪。另外，领导上对工厂经营管理，少计划缺检查，只是家长式的催催问问，不注意对职员工人的教育帮助，有的职员还不知道某些制度的意义和执行办法。对工人中间发生的问题未及时严肃处理，赏罚不严明，纪律松弛。对挪用公棉作私人买卖的干部，对两次逾假不归抵抗生产竞赛运动的工人，对常犯错误的工人，无原则的迁就，助长了无组织无纪律倾向的发展。因为逐级负责的管理方法未真正实行，没有真正给股长指挥生产的权利，他们的作用没发挥起来，有的是旧股长，不敢负责只是在经理、工务科和工人当中当“介绍人”；有的是新股长，积极负责，但缺乏经验。有的工人不服从股长领导，影响生产。
    检查以后，经理、技师、工务科、经营科现已分头研究制定下半年工作计划，要将经营管理工作提高一步，克服无组织无纪律现象，认真贯彻各种制度，树立逐级负责制，打下真正企业化管理的基础，加强技术研究，用土产代替外来原料，提高质量，再提高现在产量的百分之十六。关于逐级负责制的树立，决定：具体帮助股长工作，打破旧股长的顾虑。教育党员、工人服从股长指挥，并明确规定股长的职权，在经理领导下，率领工人完成生产任务，彻底执行各种制度。为保证生产任务完成，股长有权指挥调动本股工人，处理工作中发生的问题。同时股长应听取工人意见，改进生产领导，按时间向经理作报告。
