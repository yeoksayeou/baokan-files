Criticism and Suggestions

　　Cadres in the Second District of Handan
    Why are Production Loans Being Detained?

To the Editorial Staff:

　　This spring, the Jinnan Bank branch allocated a portion of loans to Handan County. Because the sub-branch only had two people to support the work at that time, they could not personally distribute the loans to the villages, so they had to let the district coordinate the work. The second district had a loan of 11 million yuan this time. 9,677,500 yuan was loaned to the masses, 167,000 yuan was loaned to district cadres, 50,000 yuan was embezzled, and 1,100,500 yuan has not been loaned out. At that time, the bank decided to return all the unloaned funds, but despite repeated requests, and even after the county committee informed them, the district still ignored it.

　　We don't know what the district cadres are using the loans for when they lend them out so casually. The loan procedures are chaotic, and there are even embezzlements. The district even detains the production loans for the masses as their own working capital and has not returned them to this day. We request the Handan County Government and the responsible comrades of the Second District to immediately inspect and correct this behavior, which seriously hinders loan and production work.

### 邯郸二区干部　为啥扣留生产贷款？

　　邯郸二区干部
    为啥扣留生产贷款？编辑同志：
    今春冀南银行分行拨给邯郸县一部贷款，因当时支行只有二人支持工作，不能亲自到村发放，只有让区里配合工作。二区这次贷款一千一百万元，贷给群众九百六十七万七千五百元，区干部贷了十六万七千元，脱款五万元，还有一百一十万零五千五百元未贷下去。那时银行决定把没贷下去的款全部交回，但经屡次催讨，县委会也曾告知，该区仍置之不理。
    区干部这样随便贷款，不知作何用？贷款手续又紊乱，还脱款，甚至于区上扣留群众生产贷款当成自己的流动资金至今不交，这种严重妨碍贷款与生产工作的行为，请邯郸县府及二区负责同志立即检查纠正。
