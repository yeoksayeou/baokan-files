Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th: The Jiaodong People's Liberation Army recovered Fushan County, west of Yantai, on the 7th of this month. The defending enemy, a unit of the Kuomintang's 8th Reorganized Division and other bandit troops, fled to Yantai. News from Fushan stated: The enemy's escape from Fushan is the first step in their escape from Yantai. The recovery of Fushan and the recovery of Heze, the capital of southwestern Shandong, are both developments following the liberation of Jinan.

Xinhua News Agency, North China, 10th: Chengwu County in southwestern Shandong was recovered at the end of last month, one day after it was occupied. So far, this is the only performance of the Kuomintang's imaginary "Xuzhou National Army's Northern Expeditionary Campaign." A unit of Qiu Qingquan's 5th Reorganized Division invaded Chengwu County on September 27th and was defeated by the People's Liberation Army on the 28th, with over 200 killed or wounded. The city was immediately recovered. In the southwestern corner of Shandong Province, many county towns were long occupied by the Kuomintang army, but now only the four cities of Yutai, Shanxian, Caoxian, and Dingtao are still occupied.

　　济南解放后的胜利发展
    烟台以西收复福山
    鲁西南已大部光复
    【新华社华东十日电】胶东解放军本月七日收复烟台以西的福山县城，守敌国民党整八师一部及其他匪军逃往烟台。福山消息称：敌人逃离福山是其逃离烟台的第一步。福山的收复和鲁西南首府荷泽的收复，同样是济南解放后的发展。
    【新华社华北十日电】鲁西南的城武县城在上月底被侵占一天后被收复。迄今为止，这是国民党幻想中的“徐州国军北上会战”的唯一表演。邱匪清泉所属整五师一部，在九月二十七日侵占城武县城，二十八日即被解放军击溃，毙伤共二百余人，该城当即收复。山东省的西南角有许多的县城曾长期被国民党军盘踞，但现在还被侵占的仅有鱼台、单县、曹县、定陶四城。
