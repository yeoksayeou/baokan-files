　　Tests are a Good Method to Promote Cadre Learning
    On October 10th, this newspaper published a news item about cadre learning tests in Fanshi County, Beiyue District. The results of that test showed that out of over a hundred people, only twenty-five passed, while eighty failed. This tells us a fact that deserves serious attention: cadres lack basic knowledge of the correct line and policies to an extreme degree, and even ordinary general knowledge is scarce. On October 18th, this newspaper also published the results of a test conducted by the Propaganda Department of the Jizhong District Party Committee on Grade A cadres of directly subordinate units. Three hundred and thirty people from twenty-four agencies, including the Party Committee and the Administrative Office, participated. The test content included ten questions on the current situation, tasks, policies, and general knowledge of reading newspapers. The results showed that the overall average score was 59.98, with one hundred and seventy-three people passing and one hundred and fifty-seven failing. Among the main responsible cadres of various agencies participating in the test were twenty people, including vice-principals, agency directors, bureau directors, and company managers. Thirteen of them passed, and seven failed, with an average score of 64.1, the highest being 97 and the lowest being 30.4.

    The results of this test further reveal that the theoretical learning and basic cultural knowledge of middle-level and above cadres are very poor.

    For example, the understanding of the general land reform line, which is "relying on the poor peasants, uniting with the middle peasants, and eliminating the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinction to develop agricultural production," is generally vague and one-sided, lacking a complete and unified understanding. Some comrades still hold the purely poor peasant and hired laborer viewpoints that have been repeatedly criticized, believing that "highly satisfying the demands of poor peasants and hired laborers, letting them be the masters, and holding great power" is the sign of thorough land reform. Regarding the middle peasant issue, only some comrades have noticed the need to unite with the middle peasants. Regarding the specific handling of middle peasants who have been struggled against, although most comrades have noted the principle of compensating middle peasants whose interests have been violated, the overall average was able to pass; however, some comrades still lack the attitude of making concrete analysis of concrete matters. Some comrades mixed up floating property with land for processing, without distinguishing between already distributed and undistributed floating property; some only put forward an abstract principle of "returning the original items" or "not returning them."

    Another example is the poorest test performance regarding the bourgeois nationalist betrayal of the Tito leadership group of the Yugoslav Communist Party. The question was worth fifteen points, with nine points required to pass, but the overall average score was only 6.53 points, with many comrades handing in blank papers. The twenty main responsible cadres of the agencies averaged only seven points, with twelve people (i.e., 60 percent) failing. This major theoretical principle issue, which all Party cadres must seriously study, has been universally neglected by everyone.

    This test also tells us that the lack of basic common knowledge has reached an alarming degree. For example, regarding the understanding of New Democracy, some comrades even answered that Eastern European New Democratic countries were China and Korea, and even regarded socialist Soviet Union and imperialist America and Britain as New Democratic countries. Among such comrades, there was also a responsible cadre who only scored an average of 30.4 points. It is said that he had not read a newspaper for half a year.

    Obviously, the test materials from Fanshi County and the directly subordinate agencies in Jizhong put forward an extremely urgent task for us, which is to strengthen cadres' theoretical and policy learning and basic cultural knowledge learning. If the level of Grade A cadres in the directly subordinate agencies of Jizhong is already as described above, then the situation of other cadres need not be mentioned. Today, the revolution is developing exceptionally rapidly, and the situation is expanding and becoming more complex, but our cadres still lack a unified understanding of the Party's line and policies to such an extent, and theoretical and common knowledge is so lacking. This is very inconsistent. Under such an extremely contradictory situation, to ensure the complete and correct implementation of the Party's policies and lines, and to avoid losing direction and wavering from left to right in practical work, we must earnestly strengthen Party internal study life, improve the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism, and learn to apply it in specific practical movements. This is a very urgent task in the current cadre learning.

    Experience has proven that holding timely and correct cadre tests is an effective method for checking and promoting learning, and it is worthy of universal promotion. Tests should be established as a regular system, conducted regularly and planned according to the learning progress of each period. Various answers should be evaluated and summarized, and published, and correct answers should be provided, so as to check learning results, discover problems in learning, and strengthen learning guidance. However, the following issues must be paid attention to during testing to avoid biases: (1) Testing is only one of the important methods for promoting cadre learning and cannot replace the entire ideological and organizational leadership of learning. Simply emphasizing testing is prone to formalism. (2) The test questions must combine theory with practice. In this test, some questions, such as the specific handling of middle peasants who have been struggled against, the standards for thorough land reform, how to correctly set wage standards, and some general knowledge questions about reading newspapers, were all very well formulated because they were based on the Party's line and policies, and were related to practical work and important current affairs and political common sense. After such a test, it can help cadres further understand the Party's policies and implement them in practical work. Some other questions, such as "How many people are there in the entire liberated area, how many cities, how many enemies have been eliminated, how many cities have been liberated, and how many people are there?" are purely memorization-based questions, which easily lead cadres to learn by simply remembering nouns and numbers, with little practical effect. (3) Do not test suddenly and without purpose, as this easily creates a phenomenon of testing for the sake of testing.

    The tendency of cadres to neglect the learning of theory and basic cultural knowledge is serious, but as long as we recognize the danger of this tendency and can use various methods to strengthen and promote the learning of Marxism-Leninism theory, then we will definitely be able to improve a step further on the existing basis.

### 测验是推动干部学习的良好方法

　　测验是推动干部学习的良好方法
    十月十日本报发表了一条北岳区繁峙县干部学习测验的消息，那个测验的结果，百余人中及格的只有廿五人，不及格的倒有八十人。这告诉我们一个值得引起大家严重注意的事实，就是：干部对的路线政策的基本知识是极端缺乏的，连普通常识也都很少。十月十八日本报又发表了冀中区党委宣传部对直属单位甲级干部的测验。参加的有党委、行署等二十四个机关单位，共三百三十人，测验内容包括时局，任务，政策和读报常识等十个题目。测验结果，全体总平均五九·九八分，及格的一百七十三人，不及格的一百五十七人，各机关参加测验的主要负责干部有副校长、社长、厅长、公司经理等二十人，其中十三人及格，七人不及格，平均分数为六四·一分，最高的九十七分，最低的三○·四分。
    从这次测验的结果更可看出：中级以上干部的理论学习和基本文化知识的学习都是非常差的。
    例如：对于土改总路线“依靠贫农，团结中农，有步骤地、有分别地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产”的认识，一般均很模糊，而且片面，没有完整统一的理解，有的同志仍抱有早已再三批判了的单纯贫雇观点，认为“高度满足贫雇要求，贫雇当家，掌握大权”即是土改彻底的标志。关于中农问题，只有部分同志才注意到团结中农。对被斗中农的具体处理办法问题，虽然多数同志注意了补偿被侵犯中农的原则，全体平均能够及格；但仍有部分同志缺乏对具体事物作具体分析的态度，有的同志把浮财与土地混淆处理，对已分和未分的浮财不加区别；有的只提出一个抽象原则“原物退还”或“不退还”。
    再如，关于南共铁托领导集团的资产阶级民族主义背叛性的错误，测验成绩最差。该题十五分满，九分及格，但全体平均分数只六·五三分，不少同志交了白卷。二十个机关主要负责干部平均只有七分，共有十二人（即百分之六十）不及格。一般同志只是模糊的答为“反苏”“对内实行法西斯主义”或“没有消灭富农”，对于这样一个全党干部必须认真研究的重大理论原则问题，大家是普遍漠视的。
    这次测验还告诉我们：基本常识的缺乏已达到惊人程度，如对新民主主义的认识，有些同志竟把东欧新民主主义国家答成中国和朝鲜，甚至把社会主义的苏联和帝国主义的美国、英国也当成了新民主主义国家。这样的同志当中，还有一位是负责干部，他平均只得三○·四分，据说他就有半年不看报纸。
    显然，繁峙县和冀中直属机关测验的材料，向我们提出了一个异常迫切的任务，即加强干部理论政策的学习和基本文化知识的学习。如果说冀中直属机关甲级干部的水平还是如上所述，那末，其他干部就不用说了。今天革命发展异常迅速，局面日益开展而复杂，但我们干部对党的路线政策却还是如此缺乏统一的理解，理论和常识却如此缺少，这是很不相称的。在这种极其矛盾的情况下，要保证党的政策路线完全正确的贯彻实现，在实际工作中不致迷失方向，左右摇摆，就必须认真加强党内学习生活，提高马列主义的理论水平，并且学会在具体的实际运动中加以运用，这在当前的干部学习中是一个非常迫切的任务。
    经验证明：正确的适时的举行干部的测验，乃是检查和推动学习的有效方法，值得普遍推行。测验应建立为一种经常的制度，按照各个时期的学习进度，经常有计划的举行，对各种答案加以评判总结，予以公布，提出正确答案，借以检查学习成绩，发现学习中的问题，加强学习的指导。但在测验时必须注意以下问题，以免发生偏向：（一）测验只是推动干部学习的重要方法之一，不能代替整个学习的思想领导和组织领导。单纯强调测验容易犯形式主义毛病。（二）测验的问题必须是理论与实际相结合的。这次测验中，有些问题如关于被斗中农的具体处理，土改彻底的标准，如何正确规定工资标准，以及一些读报常识的问题，都出的很好，因为这些都是根据党的路线政策，以实际工作及重要的时事政治常识为内容的，经过这样的测验，就可以帮助干部进一步了解党的政策并在实际工作中加以贯彻。另一些问题，如“全国解放区共有人口多少，城市多少，消灭敌人多少，解放城市多少，人口多少？”则是纯粹记忆性的问题，易于引导干部学习走向光记名词数字的方法，很少实效。（三）不要突然地无目的地考试，这容易造成为测验而测验的现象。
    干部中忽视理论和基本文化知识学习的倾向是严重的，但只要我们认识到这种倾向的危险，能用各种方法来加强和推动马列主义理论的学习，那我们就一定能在现有的基础上提高一步。
