Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Striving to unite, transform, and cultivate intellectuals is one of the important tasks in all liberated areas, and it is an indispensable condition for overthrowing the reactionaries and building a new China. The special instructions issued by the Central China Bureau of the CPC on September 29 regarding this issue are worthy of reference by other liberated areas, especially the newly liberated areas.

The instructions from the Central China Bureau first analyze the current situation of intellectuals in the Central China region and their relationship with the revolution. It points out: In the Central China region, there are tens of thousands of students who have graduated or studied in universities and middle schools, as well as teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools and government employees. They have suffered all kinds of pain and devastation under the Kuomintang's extremely reactionary and increasingly collapsing rule, including unemployment, lack of education, lack of freedom of speech and body, and lack of security in life. Most of them have seen that the Kuomintang's life is coming to an end, deeply hate the aggression of American imperialism, and sympathize and hope for the increasingly developing people's revolutionary movement. Since our army entered Central China, thousands of intellectuals, especially college and middle school students and teachers, have flocked to the liberated areas to study, teach, or engage in other revolutionary work. Many young intellectuals have come to the liberated areas from cities occupied by Chiang Kai-shek, even from thousands of miles away, breaking through layers of blockades and risking their lives. These facts fully demonstrate their love for the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Intellectuals are a major source for us to cultivate talents for various constructions in the Central China Liberated Area, an important way to solve our current and future difficulties in cadres for various construction works, and also an important force for us to establish a broad anti-American and anti-Chiang united front, stabilize social order, and connect with the local masses in the new areas. Therefore, extensively striving to unite young intellectuals has become one of the important tasks of the Party in Central China. However, due to our neglect of proactively striving for and uniting young intellectuals in the Central China region, certain errors in policies, and the influence of the Kuomintang reactionary propaganda, many of them still hold a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude towards our Party. Also, because most of them come from landlord, rich peasant, bourgeois, and petty-bourgeois families, and have been influenced by bourgeois education for a long time, although most of them tend to be revolutionary or have the potential to be revolutionary, they generally have the views of despising workers and peasants and being divorced from the masses. Therefore, to enable them to "serve the people" and "integrate with workers and peasants" and engage in various arduous construction works, it is necessary to conduct necessary propaganda and explanation work and ideological transformation work. That is to say, they must politically understand the situation and future of the Chinese revolution and the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, establish a revolutionary stand to serve the people, and ideologically abandon the bad habits of arrogance and self-righteousness, and develop a pragmatic and humble learning style. To achieve this, the most important thing is of course to rely on them to undergo long-term training in actual struggles, but providing necessary training and education in advance to give them preliminary enlightenment ideologically is a prerequisite for carrying out transformation.

Based on the above analysis and existing experience, the Central China Bureau has stipulated the following steps in the instructions for striving, uniting, transforming, and cultivating intellectuals.

First, our leadership organs at all levels should politically recognize the importance of this work and should use various opportunities (such as speeches, reports, and cultural and recreational activities at various meetings) to conduct oral or written propaganda through various methods (such as newspapers, announcements, slogans, and cartoons) to explain our Party's policies and guidelines for intellectuals, point out the path that Chinese intellectuals should take, eliminate their concerns about us, and gradually make them understand us and approach us.

Secondly, we should open various short-term schools or training courses, and call on and mobilize them to study and receive training. We should also consider absorbing teachers and students with status and prestige among local intellectuals to participate in the work of schools and training courses. In such schools and training courses, political study should generally be conducted first, followed by professional study. The duration should generally be at least three to four months. Political study should focus on current affairs, basic issues of the Chinese revolution, and the basic policies of our Party.

Thirdly, democratic governments at all levels should convene various types of symposiums for intellectuals, report and explain to them, and mobilize them to discuss current affairs and policies, so that they can understand that the Kuomintang is bound to be defeated and the Communist Party is bound to win, and choose the path they should take.

Fourthly, we should maintain, restore, or create new regular schools (this is especially important in newly liberated cities) in order to cultivate a large number of new intellectuals for a long time, and enable teachers and professors in the original universities and middle schools to continue to engage in education. However, the focus of this work at present should be on striving to unite and transform existing intellectuals.

The instructions emphasize that the following specific issues should be handled correctly when implementing the policy of striving for and transforming intellectuals.

(1) When various training courses and cadre schools are held in various places, we must prevent the emergence of anarchic and unorganized states, oppose liberalism and departmentalism, and avoid the bad phenomenon of competing with each other. We must carry out the work of striving for transformation in accordance with the Party's correct policies and unified action.

(2) For newly arrived intellectuals, we may relax a little in terms of living conditions (food, clothing, student learning supplies, etc.), but ideologically we should advocate the spirit of hard work that "one should think of where one's food comes from when eating a bowl of porridge and one should always remember how difficult it is to obtain even a single thread of silk." In particular, the cadres participating in the training work must set an example and influence them.

(3) In learning, we must promote a democratic and free style, so that students can say what they want to say without any worries. This is an important condition for striving to unite and transform them. This kind of ideological democracy and freedom is for the purpose of making it easier for young people to recognize the truth through full awareness and from debate and research, and not to adopt an attitude of letting things drift and indulgence towards the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements.

(4) In such non-Party schools and training courses, it is forbidden to adopt methods such as three check-ups, rectification campaigns, and cadre screening; instead, mass activities such as seminars, discussion meetings, debate meetings, and wall newspapers should be used to launch ideological debates and solve ideological problems. Students and public employees have been subjected to years of special agent rule by Chiang Kai-shek, and it is inevitable that a few resolute counter-revolutionary elements and special agents are mixed in, who should be investigated by the government. However, ordinary Kuomintang members and members of the Three People's Principles Youth League should be treated differently, as most of them were forced to join in order to seek study or employment, and the rest are not resolute counter-revolutionary elements. They should be allowed to study for a certain period of time, have a preliminary understanding of our policies, and have their concerns eliminated or reduced before they are mobilized to register or report the truth to a certain organization. In this way, both those who have joined the Kuomintang's organization but have little ideological connection with the Kuomintang will dare to tell their true history, and a few truly hidden special agents can be isolated and exposed.

### 中共中原局发布指示　争取团结改造培养知识分子

　　中共中原局发布指示
  　争取团结改造培养知识分子
    【新华社陕北十八日电】争娶团结、改造、培养知识分子——这是全解放区目前的重要任务之一，这是打倒反动派、建立新中国的伟大事业所不可缺少的条件之一。中共中原中央局在九月二十九日为这个问题所发布的专门指示，值得其他解放区特别是新解放区的参考。
    中原局的指示首先分析目前中原地区知识分子的状况及其与革命的关系。它指出：在中原地区，曾在大中学校毕业或肄业学生及中小学校的教职员和公务人员，数以千、万计。他们曾经在国民党极端反动与日趋崩溃的统治下，饱尝失业、失学、言论身体无自由、生活生命无保障的各种痛苦与摧残，其中大多数已看清国民党的寿命快要完结，对美帝国主义的侵略十分痛恨，对于日益发展的人民革命运动则寄予同情和希望。自我军进驻中原之后，已有成千的知识分子，特别是大中学生和教师们，都相率来解放区就学、执教或从事其他革命工作。并有不少的知识青年是从蒋占城市、甚至不远千里、冲破重重封锁、冒着生命危险投奔解放区者。这些事实，充分表现了他们对于中国共产党与人民解放军的热爱。知识分子是我们在中原解放区培养各项建设人才的一个主要来源，是解决我们目前及今后在各种建设工作中干部困难的一个重要途径，同时也是我们在新区建立广泛的抗美反蒋统一战线、稳定社会秩序，联系当地群众的一个重要力量。所以，大量争取团结知识青年，就成为当前中原党的重要任务之一。但是由于我们在中原地区对于主动地争取与团结知识青年工作的忽视与某些政策上的错误，以及国民党反动派欺骗宣传的影响，他们中间还有不少人尚对我党抱着怀疑观望态度。又因为他们多半是地主、富农、资产阶级与小资产阶级的家庭出身，长期地受资产阶级教育的熏染，他们的大多数虽然倾向革命或有倾向革命的可能，但一般都存在轻视工农、脱离群众的观点。因此，要使他们能够“为人民服务”，“与工农结合”，从事各种艰巨的建设工作，就非进行必要的宣传解释工作与思想改造工作不可。这就是说，要使他们在政治上认识中国革命的形势、前途和中国共产党的主张，确定为人民服务的革命立场，在思想上抛去自高自大、自以为是的恶习，养成实事求是、虚心学习的作风。要做到这一点，最主要的当然是依靠他们在实际斗争中去经受长期的锻炼，但事先加以必要的训练教育，使他们在思想上获得初步的启发，则是进行改造的前提条件。
    根据上述的分析和已有的经验，中原局在指示中对于争取、团结、改造和培养知识分子，规定了如下的步骤。
    首先，在我们的各级领导机关，应从政治上去认识这一工作的重要性，应利用各种机会（如各种会议上的讲话、报告、文娱活动等）通过各种方式（如报纸、布告、标语、传单、漫画等）进行口头的或文字的宣传，说明我党对于知识分子的政策方针，指出中国知识分子应走的道路，消除他们对我们的顾虑，使其逐渐地了解我们，靠近我们。
    其次，就是开办各种较短期的学校或训练班，号召与动员他们来学习受训。并酌量吸收当地知识分子中有地位有威信的教员学生参加学校和训练班的工作。在这种学校与训练班内，一般地应先学习政治，后学习业务。时间一般至少需三个月至四个月。政治学习以时事问题、中国革命基本问题及我党基本政策为主。
    第三，由各级民主政府召开各种各样的知识分子座谈会，向他们报告解释并发动他们讨论时事与政策，使他们了解国民党必败，共产党必胜，选定他们所应该走的道路。
    第四，维持、恢复或创设新的正规学校（这在新解放的城市中特别重要），以便较长期地培养大量新的知识分子，并使原有大中学校的教员教授，得以继续从事教育事业。但目前这一工作的重点，应放在争取团结与改造现有的知识分子身上。
    指示着重指出在实施争取与改造知识分子的政策时，应注意下列具体问题的正确处理。
    （一）各地在举办各种训练班与干部学校时，要防止产生无政府无组织状态，要反对自由主义与本位主义，避免彼此争夺的不良现象。要按照党的正确政策与统一行动具体进行争取改造工作。
    （二）对于新来的知识分子，生活上（伙食、衣服、学员学习用品等）不妨放宽一点，但思想上则应该提倡“一粥一饭当思来处不易，半丝半缕恒念物力维艰”的艰苦作风。特别是参加训练工作的干部，必须以身作则，去影响他们。
    （三）在学习中，要提倡民主自由的作风，使学生毫无顾虑地说出他们自己心中要说的话。这是争取团结与改造他们的一个重要条件。这种思想上的民主与自由，是为着便于青年经过充分的自觉，从争论和研讨中认识真理，而不是对于反革命分子的破坏活动采取自流与放任态度。
    （四）在这种非党的学校与训练班中，必须禁止采取三查、整风、审干等办法；而应采用座谈会、讨论会、辩论会、壁报等群众活动的方式，展开思想争论，解决思想问题。学生和公教人员经过蒋介石多年的特务统治，不免混有少数坚决反革命分子和特务分子，应当由政府予以查究。但是对于普通的国民党员三青团员因他们多半是为了求得学习或职业而被迫加入，其余的也不是坚决的反革命分子，故应分别对待。应当让他们经过一定时期的学习，对我们的政策有了初步认识，顾虑已经消除或减少之后，再动员他们登记或将实情报告一定的组织。这样，既可以使这些虽然曾经加入过国民党的组织但思想上与国民党绝少联系的人敢于说出自己真实的历史，又可以使少数真正暗藏的特务分子孤立与暴露出来。
