[Taiyue Electric] Tunliu's Xicun organized manpower to dig the land, overcoming the difficulty of lacking animal power. Xicun has more than 2,900 mu of autumn land, but only 53 head of livestock. Seven head were requisitioned for labor, and two were used for transportation, leaving 44 head, equivalent to 22 teams. Assuming each team plows three mu per day, only half would be plowed by the beginning of winter. Therefore, to achieve a universal cultivation, it is necessary to organize all male and female able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers to dig the land. After calculation and research, the village cadres mobilized and organized manpower to dig. In ten days, all 44 head of livestock had gone to the fields for autumn cultivation, and 355 mu of land had been plowed in five days. However, there were not many people digging, and they were not organized. After inspection, there were two reasons: First, the wages for digging were too high, four sheng of rice per work unit, and one work unit could only dig three to four fen of land, requiring two and a half work units to dig one mu, which would cost one dou of rice. Plowing one mu with a double plow only costs eight sheng of rice, so everyone prefers plowing to digging. Second, although some military families had organized digging teams, they were afraid that if they dug themselves, they would not be provided with substitute labor, so they did not dig either. After discovering the above situation, a meeting was held on the evening of the 15th to resolve it. According to the opinions of the masses, the following methods were decided: First, the wage was changed to seven sheng of rice or seventy jin of grass per mu of land plowed, six sheng for single plowing, and digging was changed to three sheng per work unit. Second, based on the labor and wealth of the military and veteran families, a method of substitute cultivation was stipulated to ensure that the 132.5 mu of autumn land of 35 military and veteran families with no labor would be universally cultivated once, and even the stubble of land for planting beans next year must be dug over. However, in order to reward military families for participating in digging, it was decided that if the military families dug the land for which substitute cultivation was provided, they would still be issued substitute labor vouchers for use on other tasks. Third, for the more than 30 households of widows, widowers, and orphans in the village, in addition to using grain and grass to turn into animal power for cultivation, if they could not afford to pay wages in rice, they could use making shoes and sewing clothes to repay the labor. After the meeting, everyone went to publicize to the masses, and on the 16th, many people organized to dig the land. For example, the three groups of Wang Taizi, Hou Zhanju, and Lao Lu, with 21 male able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, and the six members of the military family Liu Baodi's group all started digging.

　　西村秋耕抓得紧
  　缺少牲口组织人刨
    【太岳电】屯留西村组织人力刨地，克服畜力困难。西村有秋地二千九百多亩，牲口只有五十三头，支差走了七头，运输走了两头，余下四十四头能合二十二犋，以每犋每日犁三亩计算，至立冬才犁一半，因此要作到普耕一遍，必须组织男女全半劳力刨地。村干部计算研究以后，动员组织人力刨地。十日四十四头牲口已全部上地秋耕，五天已耕地三百五十五亩，但刨地的不多也没有组织起来。经检查后有两个原因：一是刨地工资太大，每工四升米，一工只能刨三分到四分地，两个半工才刨一亩，就需工资米一斗。双犁耕一亩才八升米，所以都愿耕不愿刨。二是有些军属虽然组织了刨地组，但又怕自己刨了不代耕了，所以也不刨。发现以上情况后，即于十五日晚上开会解决，根据群众意见又决定了下面的办法：第一、工资改为耕一亩地七升米或七十斤草，单犁一亩六升，刨地改为每工三升。第二、根据军干烈属劳力富力情况，规定出代耕办法，保证三十五户无劳力的军干烈属的一百三十二亩五分秋地，普耕一遍，就是明年种豆的也要把茬刨过。但为了奖励军属参加刨地，决定代耕的地如军属自己刨了，仍发给代耕工票，以便用到其他活上。第三、全村三十余户鳏寡孤独，除能用谷草变畜力耕地外，如出不起工资米，可用做鞋缝衣来还工。会后分头向群众宣传，十六日就有不少人组织起来刨地。如王太子、侯展聚、老路等三个小组，男全半劳力二十一人及军属刘保弟小组六人都开始刨地。
