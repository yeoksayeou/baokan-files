[Hebei Electric] On the 25th, widespread autumn rain fell in the southwestern region of Hebei Province, making wheat planting on dry land no longer a problem. Currently, throughout the entire Hebei Province region, except for late-season crops such as peanuts, cotton, and yams, early-maturing crops have been completely harvested, and wheat fields have been fully planted, with most seedlings emerging. Autumn fallow land is either being fertilized and tilled or has already been planted. According to statistics from 21 villages in seven districts, as of the 15th, 12,755 mu of wheat have been planted, accounting for 24 percent of the total cultivated land area. This rainfall brought three to four finger-widths of rain to various counties in the 11th District and southern parts of the 8th and 9th Districts bordering the 11th District, making wheat planting possible on all dry land. After the rain, the 11th District Party Committee immediately instructed all counties to launch a concentrated effort to plant wheat, with all government agencies fully assisting the masses in planting. It is estimated that by mid-October, all land suitable for wheat planting in the district can be fully planted.

　　冀中西南部普降秋雨
    各县突击种麦
    【冀中电】二十五日冀中西南部地区普降秋雨，旱田种麦已不成问题。目前冀中全区除花生、棉花、山药等晚田外，早熟作物完全收割毕，麦地已完全种上，大部出苗。秋楂地有的正送粪耕地，有的已经种上，据转交七个区二十一个村统计，截至十五日止，已种麦一二七五五亩，占全部耕地面积的百分之二十四。此次落雨，十一分区各县及八、九分区南部与十一分区邻接县份，均落雨三四指，旱田都可种麦。雨后，十一地委立即指示各县展开突击种麦，各机关全力帮助群众耩种，估计十月中旬，该分区能够种麦的地即可全部种上。
