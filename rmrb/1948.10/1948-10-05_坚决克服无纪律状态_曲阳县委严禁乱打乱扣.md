Beiyue News: The Quyang County Party Committee recently conducted a serious review of deviations in the implementation of policies to protect human rights and property rights, and formulated improvement measures to instruct various districts. Since the beginning of spring, incidents of beating people, detaining people, and imposing arbitrary fines have been severe throughout the county. Forty-two cadres across the county have beaten people. Cadres in Tatou Village, District Three, when dealing with a theft issue, without thorough investigation and understanding, detained six people, labeled them as thieves, and hung and beat a farmer unconscious. Arbitrary detention by districts and villages was widespread. According to statistics from the past two months alone, over eighty people were detained in the districts. Some districts and villages imposed arbitrary fines. For example, District Four fined the Xiyangping Distillery 3.1 million yuan without approval from higher authorities. Xiaolin village cadres privately fined 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, all of which was embezzled and wasted. In addition, six or seven incidents of rural violence, forced suicides, and suicides have occurred recently. Regarding the causes of the above serious phenomena, the County Party Committee's review concluded that, first and foremost, the county and district leaderships exhibited serious bureaucratic tendencies, failing to address discovered problems promptly, being careless and delaying, and not offering strict criticism of these errors in a timely manner, allowing these phenomena to develop. The county's judicial and public security organs lacked in-depth investigation and research, leading to certain instances of forced confessions. Secondly, some districts did not earnestly implement the resolutions of higher authorities and acted independently. At the Enlarged Cadre Meeting in May, the County Party Committee clearly pointed out the prohibition of arbitrary beatings and detentions, but afterwards, this phenomenon worsened in some districts, which is a serious manifestation of disorganization and lack of discipline. Thirdly, some Party members and cadres did not understand the Party's policies, failed to distinguish between right and wrong, and engaged in indiscriminate attacks without principle; some cadres did not delve into their work and, in certain time-sensitive tasks, were eager for quick results, attempting to overcome certain undisciplined phenomena among the masses with coercive and commanding methods, hoping to kill the chicken to scare the monkey. Regarding measures to rectify the policies of protecting human rights and property rights, the County Party Committee resolved: 1. Strictly adhere to arrest procedures. Except for perpetrators caught in the act, districts and villages have no authority to detain or arrest people; districts detaining perpetrators caught in the act must transfer them to the county government's judicial organs for processing within three days; for other necessary detentions and arrests, the materials must be thoroughly investigated and approved by the county government before implementation. 2. Handle civil cases primarily through mediation and avoid detention. Those who disagree with the mediation are allowed to appeal and should not be obstructed. 3. Districts and villages have no authority to impose fines. If fines are necessary, they must first be reported to the county for approval before implementation. Past fines by districts and villages should be quickly cleared and reported to the county. 4. Strengthen cadres' policy learning to enable them to truly understand the spirit of the policies, conduct reviews in light of actual situations, and overcome undesirable work styles. 5. Conduct in-depth investigation and research, and handle problems cautiously and promptly. It is imperative to adhere to the system of seeking instructions beforehand and reporting afterwards. In the event of major incidents involving loss of life, special personnel should be dispatched immediately for investigation and handling. (Fourth Branch Agency)

Editor's Note: The Quyang County Party Committee had a resolution in May prohibiting arbitrary beatings and detentions, which was good and necessary, but the fact that the same phenomenon is still occurring now deserves deep study, and specific handling methods must be prescribed. Otherwise, this resolution will still fail. For example, the bureaucracy in the county and district leaderships, and the failure to solve problems in a timely manner, is itself a manifestation of indiscipline. If there is no specific handling method for this phenomenon, it cannot be guaranteed that similar phenomena will not occur in the future.

### 坚决克服无纪律状态　曲阳县委严禁乱打乱扣

　　坚决克服无纪律状态
    曲阳县委严禁乱打乱扣
    【北岳讯】曲阳县委日前认真检查执行保障人权、财权政策中的偏差，并定出改进办法指示各区。该县入春以来，打人、扣人、乱罚现象严重，全县打过人的干部四十二人。三区塔头村干处理偷盗问题，不加深入调查了解，扣了六个人，加以小偷罪名，将一农民吊打失去知觉。区村随便扣人很多，据近两月来统计，仅在区扣押者即达八十多人。有的区村滥行罚款。如四区未经上级批准，擅自罚了西洋平一酒坊三百一十万元。晓林村干私自罚款三四万，全部贪污浪费。此外，农村行凶、逼命、自杀等事件最近发生了六、七起。发生以上严重现象的原因，县委检讨认为首先是县区领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，没有及时处理发现的问题，马虎拖延，对这些错误没有及时提出严格的批评，使这种现象得到发展机会。县司法与公安机关，则缺乏深入调查研究，形成某些逼供现象。其次是有的区不认真执行上级决议，各自为政。五月扩干会上县委已明确指出禁止乱打乱扣，但其后有的区这种现象反而严重起来，这是严重的无组织无纪律现象。第三是由于部分党员干部不了解党的政策，没有分清是非轻重，无原则的乱打击；有的干部则不深入工作，在某些有时间性的工作中，急于求功，企图以打一儆百的强迫命令方法克服群众中某些无组织无纪律现象。关于端正保障人权、财权政策的办法，县委决议：一、严格遵行逮捕手续，除现行犯外，区村无扣人捕人权；区扣押现行犯，不得超过三天需送县政府司法机关处理；其他必要扣捕者，需先将材料调查清楚，经县府批准始得执行。二、处理民事案件，以调解为主，不得扣押。不服调解者，准其上诉，不应留难。三、区村没有罚人权，必要罚款时先报县批准始得执行。各区、村过去的罚款应迅速清理报县。四、加强干部的政策学习，使其真正领会政策精神，并联系实际进行检讨，克服不良作风。五、深入调查研究、慎重、迅速地处理问题。必需遵守事先请示事后报告的制度。遇有重大人命案件，应速派专人调查处理。（四支社）
    编者按：曲阳县委五月份曾有决议禁止乱打乱扣，这是很好的，必要的，但到现在仍然发生同样现象，则值得深刻研究，规定具体处理办法。否则这次决议仍然会落空。比如，县区领导上官僚主义，发生了问题不及时解决，这本身就是无纪律现象。如对这种现象没有具体的处理办法制度，即不能保证以后不发生同类现象。
