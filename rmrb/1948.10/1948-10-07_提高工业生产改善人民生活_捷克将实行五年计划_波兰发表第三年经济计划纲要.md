Upon completion of the five-year plan, industrial production will increase by 57% compared to 1948, with steel production increasing by 80% and heavy machinery production increasing by 200%. Agricultural production will increase by 15%, and national income will increase by 48%. The people's living standards will improve by 60% compared to pre-war levels. At the same time, state-owned industries across Czechoslovakia have recently sent telegrams to Premier Zápotocký, reporting the early completion of the two-year plan. The Gottwald Steel Plant, the Tesla Radio Factory, and the Bata Shoe Factory, among others, completed their plans before September 20th. The national industrial production two-year plan aims to be completed before October 28th, Czechoslovakia's National Day. By then, Czechoslovakia's production level will exceed the pre-war level of 1937 by 10%, and a new five-year plan will be implemented on this basis.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: TASS, Warsaw News: Poland's National Economic Plan for 1949, adopted by the Polish government in June this year, which is the third year plan of the three-year plan, has recently been published in outline. The plan stipulates that the total output of state-owned industries in 1949 will increase by 21% to 23% compared to this year, with steel increasing by 20%. Total agricultural output will increase by 14% to 15%. The number of tractors will increase from 10,500 to 14,500, and the production of artificial fertilizers will increase to 970,000 tons.

The total investment of the Polish National Economic Three-Year Plan amounts to 3.4 billion US dollars. When the 1949 plan is completed, industrial production will increase by 52% compared to 1938, with coal production increasing from 38.1 million tons per year to 80 million tons, and steel production increasing from 1.4 million tons to 2 million tons.
