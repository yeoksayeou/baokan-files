(Jinzhong Electric) The Jinzhong Second District Industry and Commerce Bureau convened a meeting of branch chiefs from various counties, deciding to vigorously help restore local industrial and mining workshops, and organize the transportation and sale of local and special products. The meeting emphasized that in their work, they should conduct in-depth investigation and research, such as the production volume, place of origin, cost, transportation and export, etc., to lay the foundation for production this winter. The coal mines in Xiaoyi, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Qingyuan, and the Taiyuan border mountains were almost entirely shut down due to the destruction by the Yan [Xishan] bandits. After liberation, the Jiaocheng County Industry and Commerce Bureau first loaned 45 million yuan (in farmers' currency, same below) to the two largest coal mines in the county to solve the problem of food rations. In early August, the two mines resumed production. The Wenshui Industry and Commerce Bureau also helped seven coal mines to recover. More than twenty coal mines will be fully restored this winter. Xiaoyi organized transportation cooperatives to help with off-season production while solving the difficulties of coal mine transportation and sales. Fenyang also plans to organize coal stations. In order to quickly restore the three machine coal mines in Jinyuan County, the District Industry and Commerce Bureau has decided to lend 100 dan of grain. The Xinghua Village Fenjiu Company in Fenyang, famous at home and abroad, was forced to close down due to the destruction by the Yan bandits. After liberation, the District Industry and Commerce Bureau invested 160 million yuan. Through two months of efforts, the first batch of more than 1,000 catties of Zhuyeqing wine was sold during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Now the Industry and Commerce Bureau has decided to invest another 475 million yuan to expand its business. In the vast rural towns of the former Second District, a large number of salt and nitrate boiling workshops were mostly seized by the Yan bandits in the past; after liberation, they are also being actively restored. There were 106 salt workshops in Fenyang Chengguan, but only 34 remained under the rule of the Yan bandits; there were originally 6 in Qingdai Village in the Tenth District, but only one remained; there were originally 24 pots in Nanwu Town, Wenshui, producing 28,800 catties of salt and 960 catties of nitrate per day, but most of them were also shut down; there were 6 in Xiaoyi Chengguan, which produced 10,000 catties of nitrate per day in addition to salt; Fenyang Chengguan originally produced more than 300,000 catties of nitrate annually, but only 8 remained in the Yan bandit era; after liberation, 3 in Fenyang rural areas have been restored. The 14 new alkali workshops opened during the famine have now produced 19,600 catties of alkali. During the Yan bandit rule, each pot in the Jiaocheng salt house had to hand over 60 catties of nitrate to the bandit "Nitrate Mining Bureau" every day, and each catty was only given Jiang currency that could buy one cigarette. After liberation, 11 pots have been restored, producing more than 6,000 catties of nitrate per day. The meeting decided that various places should vigorously solve the problems of capital and charcoal burning in the recovery process, and help promote the sale or introduce industrial departments to purchase. Qingyuan produces more than 5 million catties of grapes annually, and Fenxiao produces 1.4 million catties of walnut kernels, more than 100,000 catties of almond kernels, and more than 100,000 catties of dried fruit slices. In the past, they were all transported to Tianjin; however, due to the crazy destruction by the Yan bandits over the years, the masses fled, and transportation was blocked, resulting in a large number of them rotting. The Industry and Commerce Bureau has also decided to organize the purchase and transportation and sales, and invest in winemaking companies to make wine and smoke dried grapes. Before the war, there were more than 120 fur workshops in Jiaocheng, with more than 8,000 workers. Over the years, they have been destroyed by the Japanese invaders and Yan bandits, leaving only 5, with more than 100 workers. Now it is also planned to provide loans for recovery, absorb and promote finished products. Xiaoyi, which originally had more than 100 villages growing tobacco leaves, now only has 2 villages left, and is also helping to restore them. The Industry and Commerce Bureau also plans to actively organize the masses in the mountainous areas of Jiaocheng and Xiaoyi to collect a large number of medicinal materials such as Paeonia obovata, Codonopsis pilosula, and Poria cocos, and purchase and help transport and sell them.
