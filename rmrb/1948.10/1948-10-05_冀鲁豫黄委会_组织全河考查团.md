Organizes Whole River Inspection Team

[Jilu-Yu Electric Dispatch] In order to conduct organized and systematic investigation and research, reduce blindness in Yellow River management, and enhance foresight, the Yellow River Committee has decided to select cadres with experience and strong capabilities in river management to organize a whole river inspection team. The team officially held its establishment meeting on the 16th in a certain location and discussed the inspection plan. The meeting determined that the team headquarters would have three groups: embankment line, dangerous works, and滩面(tanmian) tributary ditch. The inspection content includes the following aspects: River situation and dangerous works: the historical path of river course changes, under what circumstances did they change, what changes have occurred in the past two years, the reasons for the changes, and the future development trend, the soil quality, the location and function of the revetments. Embankment line: whether it is regular and smooth, the height, width, and soil quality of the embankment shape, the topography and trees inside and outside the embankment. 滩面(tanmian) tributary ditch: the area, height, and soil quality of the 滩面(tanmian), the condition of new and old 滩(tan), how the tributary ditch is formed, how much water it can carry, past management situation and hazards.
