Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to TASS, Moscow, 3rd: On September 26th, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France delivered identical notes to the Soviet government regarding the situation in Berlin. On October 3rd, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent a note from the Soviet government, exceeding five thousand words, to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The note thoroughly and accurately elucidated the cause of the Berlin issue, the truth of the Berlin issue negotiations, the close relationship between the Berlin issue and the entire German issue, and the lack of any basis for the US, UK, and French governments to submit the Berlin issue to the Security Council. It also put forward new suggestions on how to handle the Berlin issue in the future.

The note begins by stating: "The Soviet Government must declare that the situation that has arisen in Berlin is entirely the responsibility of the US, UK, and French governments." The note then cites convincing facts to prove that the Berlin situation arose solely because the US, UK, and French governments had taken a series of measures to divide Germany since 1946, such as implementing a separate economic merger of the US and British occupation zones in Germany, and the London Conference's decision to establish a West German state and West German government not subject to four-power control, especially as a result of the separate currency reform. The note points out that this currency reform was "one of the final measures to split Germany and one of the most profoundly influential. If there had been no separate currency reform, the Berlin situation would not have occurred." If there had been no separate currency reform and the resulting danger of disintegrating the economic life of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the entire Berlin, the Soviet military command would not have been forced to allow the issuance of the German mark in the Soviet-occupied zone and simultaneously implement some transportation restrictions. The transportation restrictions are only "defensive and protective measures taken by the Soviet government to counter the offensive actions of the US, UK, and French governments." Regarding the repeated assertions by the US, UK, and French governments that they have the right to administer Berlin, the note reiterates the Soviet government's position, stating: "Due to these divisive actions in the western occupation zones of Germany and the western occupation zones of Berlin, the US, UK, and French governments have destroyed the four-power co-management system of Berlin, and therefore destroyed the legal basis guaranteeing their participation in the administration of Berlin."

Regarding the truth of the entire Berlin issue negotiations, the note declares: In the negotiations on the Berlin situation that began in Moscow, "Premier Stalin made the following proposals to the US, UK, and French representatives on August 2nd: (A) The Soviet military command cancels the recently implemented transportation restrictions between Berlin and the Western occupation zones of Germany. (B) At the same time, the German mark of the Soviet occupation zone will be the only currency in Berlin, while the 'B' mark of the western occupation zones will cease to circulate in Berlin. In addition, Premier Stalin expressed his firm hope that the implementation of the London Conference's decision on the establishment of a West German government should be postponed until the four-power representatives can meet to discuss the entire German issue." Premier Stalin's proposals were repeatedly discussed in subsequent meetings. The result of the negotiations between the Soviet, American, British, and French representatives was an agreement reached in Moscow on August 30th, namely: "If the four-power governors of Berlin reach an agreement on the actual implementation of the following measures, then these measures will be implemented simultaneously: (A) Cancellation of the recently implemented restrictions on traffic, transportation, and trade between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, and traffic restrictions on entry and exit to the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. (B) The German mark of the Soviet occupation zone will be the only currency generally used in Berlin, and the 'B' mark of the western zone will cease to circulate in Berlin." At the same time, the four governments instructed the four-power occupation government governors to consult in order to formulate as quickly as possible the specific measures necessary to implement the above agreement, and to draft measures for the exercise of the German mark of the Soviet occupation zone in Berlin, and measures for the exchange of currencies and the further supply and use of the German mark of the Soviet occupation zone in Berlin. In order to ensure the actual implementation of financial measures related to the implementation of a single currency in Berlin, the four governments instructed the representatives of the four-power governors to establish a financial committee (formerly translated as the Finance Committee). The four governments gave clear instructions to the four-power Financial Committee regarding its authority to control the financial measures for the implementation and circulation of the German mark of the Soviet occupation zone in Berlin; however, the instructions did not involve including the control of the above-mentioned currency issuance within the four-power financial control, "because this would lead to the three countries interfering in the management of the currency circulation of the entire Soviet occupation zone of Germany," "and the entire economic life of the Soviet occupation zone is determined by the amount of currency in circulation." Therefore, the agency responsible for issuing the German mark of the Soviet occupation zone could not be any other agency, but only the Soviet military command, just as the currency issuance in the western occupation zones was entirely controlled by the occupation authorities. However, in the Berlin negotiations, the US, British, and French governors demanded that the three countries have the right to control the currency issuance of the entire Soviet occupation zone, thereby subjecting the entire economic life of the Soviet occupation zone to their control, which, of course, the Soviet representatives could not agree to. The note pointed out that, apart from the currency issue, regarding trade between Berlin and West Germany or other countries, the Soviet Union had agreed to various opinions of the US, UK, and France; as for the Soviet Union's request to establish control over air routes between Berlin and West Germany, the US representative stated: "The Soviet government's willingness to obtain certain guarantees to crack down on the use of air transport for illegal currency transactions or black market activities is understandable, and such satisfactory guarantees can be easily obtained." However, because the US, UK, and French governments refused to fulfill the instructions to be issued to the governors unanimously agreed upon by the four countries in the Moscow talks, "the negotiations failed, although the differences remaining between the four countries were negligible."

Regarding the discussion of the entire German issue, the note declares: During the negotiations held by Stalin, Molotov, and the three-country representatives in Moscow in August, not only the Berlin issue was discussed, but also the entire German issue was discussed, and on August 27th, an agreement was reached on the full text of the communique originally scheduled to be issued after the negotiations, which is as follows: "The four governments also agreed that, in addition to the four-power governors' meeting, the representatives of the four governments should hold a meeting in the near future in the form of a meeting of the four foreign ministers or other four-power representatives to discuss (A) the unresolved issues related to Berlin; (B) any other unresolved issues affecting the entire Germany." However, the final part of the communique did not reach an agreement; this part was intended to include the US, UK, and French governments' response to the Soviet government's wish that "the implementation of the London Conference's decision on the establishment of a Western German government should be postponed until the Soviet, American, British, and French representatives are able to meet to discuss the entire German issue." The note specifically points out that in the negotiations "the Soviet government had obtained assurances from the representatives of the three countries that the London decision did not preclude the possibility of the four governments reaching an agreement on the establishment of a unified German government." The note emphasizes, "All this proves that the three governments had to admit that there is a close relationship between the Berlin issue and the entire German issue. At the same time, this means that the solution to the German issue, including the Berlin issue, must be based on the implementation of agreements unanimously agreed upon by the four countries, primarily the Potsdam Declaration and the four countries' agreement on the co-management of Germany. Because the US, UK, and French governments have taken the most serious destructive actions against the Potsdam Agreement and other agreements of the four countries on the German issue, therefore, they should be responsible for the situation that has already occurred in Germany and Berlin."

After refuting the US, UK, and French governments' insistence that "a situation has arisen in Berlin that constitutes a threat to international peace and security" as unfounded, the note declares that, given that the US, UK, and French governments have submitted the Berlin situation to the United Nations Security Council for discussion, "the Soviet government believes it must issue the following statement: (A) The Berlin situation and the entire German issue, as well as the issue of splitting Germany and establishing a separate West German government, are closely related and, according to Article 107 of the United Nations Charter, should be resolved by the four governments responsible for the occupation of Germany. (B) The United States government's statement that a situation has arisen that threatens international peace and security is inconsistent with the actual situation, and this is merely a means of applying pressure in an attempt to use the United Nations organization to achieve its aggressive purposes. (C) The Soviet government proposes that the instructions given to the four-power governors on August 30th should be recognized as an agreement between the Soviet, American, British, and French governments, and the Berlin situation should be adjusted on this basis. (D) The Soviet government proposes that a meeting of foreign ministers be convened in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement to discuss the Berlin situation and the entire German issue."

　　苏政府照会美英法
    柏林问题提交安理会无根据
    【新华社陕北九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科三日电：九月二十六日，美、英、法三国政府曾以内容相同的关于柏林形势问题的照会递交苏联政府。十月三日，苏外长莫洛托夫以长达五千余言的苏联政府照会致送美、英、法三国政府。该照会透澈而翔实地阐明了柏林问题的起因，柏林问题谈判的真相，柏林问题与整个德国问题的密切关系，以及美、英、法政府之将柏林问题提交安理会的毫无根据等，并提出了今后如何处理柏林问题的新建议。
    照会首称：“苏联政府必须声明，柏林已发生之形势，应完全由美、英、法政府负责。”照会继而引证令人信服的事实证明，柏林形势问题的发生，只是由于美、英、法政府自一九四六年以来采取了一系列的分裂德国的措施，诸如实行德境美英占领区单独的经济合并，以及伦敦会议决定成立不受四国管制之西德国家及西德政府等，特别是实行单独的货币改革的结果。照会指出这一货币改革是“最后分裂德国和影响特别深巨的措施之一。假如没有单独的货币改革，就不会发生柏林形势问题”。假如没有单独的货币改革以及由此产生的使德国苏占区和柏林整个经济生活解体的危险，苏军司令部也就不会被迫允许发行苏占区的德国马克，并同时实行一些运输上的限制。而运输上的限制，只是“苏联政府用以对付美、英、法政府攻势行动的防御性和保护性的措施”。在论及美、英、法政府一再申述他们有权管理柏林时，照会重申苏联政府的立场称：“由于在德境西占区及柏林西占区的这些分裂行动，美、英、法政府就毁坏了四国共管柏林的制度，并因此破坏了保证他们参加管理柏林的法律基础”。
    关于整个柏林问题谈判的真相，照会宣示：在莫斯科开始的关于柏林形势问题的谈判中，“斯大林总理于八月二日向美、英、法代表提出如下建议：（甲）苏军司令部取消最近实施的柏林与西德占领区间的运输限制。（乙）与此同时，苏占区的德国马克作为柏林的唯一货币，而西占区的‘Ｂ’记马克，则停止在柏林流通。此外，斯大林总理并表示其坚定的希望，即在四国代表集会讨论整个德国问题以前，关于建立西德政府的伦敦会议决定之实施应予延期。”斯大林总理的建议，在此后的会议中曾一再讨论。苏美英法代表谈判的结果，曾于八月三十日在莫斯科达成协议，即：“若柏林四国总督对下列措施之实际施行达成协议，则将该措施同时付诸实行：（甲）取消最近实施的柏林与西占区间交通、运输与贸易的限制及出入德境苏占区的交通限制。（乙）苏占区的德国马克为柏林通用的唯一货币，西区‘Ｂ’记马克停止在柏林流通”。同时，四国政府并训令四国占领军政府总督进行协商，以便尽可能迅速制订为实施上述协议所必须的具体措施，并草拟柏林行使苏占区德国马克的措施，关于货币兑换以及在柏林进一步供给与使用苏占区德国马克的措施。而为保证与柏林施行单一货币有关的金融措施之实际施行，四国政府又训令由四国总督之代表成立一金融委员会（前译为财政委员会）。四国政府对四国金融委员会管制在柏林实施与流通苏占区德国马克之金融措施的职权，给了明确的指示，然而，训令绝没有涉及将上述货币发行的管制权包括在四国金融管制之内，“因为这会导向三国干预整个德境苏占区货币流通的管理”，“而苏占区的全部经济生活都决定于货币流通额”。因此，负责发行苏占区德国马克的，不能是别的机构，只能是苏军司令部，就象西占区的货币发行完全交由占领当局管制一样。然而，在柏林谈判中，美英法总督要求三国有权管制整个苏占区的货币发行，从而使苏占区的整个经济生活受他们的管制，这当然是苏联代表所不能同意的。照会指出，除货币问题外，关于柏林与西德或其他国家的贸易，苏联曾同意美英法三国的各项意见；至于苏联要求建立对柏林与西德间航空线之管制问题，美代表曾表示：“苏联政府之愿意获得某些取缔利用空运作非法货币生意或黑市活动的保证是可以理解的，这种满意的保证是可以容易取得的。”但是由于美英法政府拒绝履行四国在莫斯科会谈中所一致同意的下达各总督的指令，“谈判遂告失败，虽然在四国之间剩下的分歧已微不足道”。
    关于讨论整个德国问题一节，照会宣告：在斯大林、莫洛托夫与三国代表八月间在莫斯科举行谈判时，不但讨论了柏林问题，而且也讨论了整个德国问题，并于八月廿七日就原订于谈判结束后发表的公报全文达成协议，该公报全文如下：“四国政府也同意，除四国总督会议之外，四国政府代表当以四国外长会议或其他四国代表会议的形式，在不久的将来举行会议，以讨论（甲）有关柏林之未决问题；（乙）任何其他影响整个德国之未决问题。”但是，该公报之最后部分并未达成协议，此一部分本拟包括美英法政府对苏联政府愿望的答复，“这种愿望就是伦敦会议关于成立西部德国政府的决定，其实施应予延期，直至苏美英法代表能够集会讨论整个德国问题之时”。照会特别指出，在谈判中“苏联政府曾得三国代表之保证：伦敦决定并不排除四国政府在成立全德统一政府问题上达成协议的可能性”。照会强调指出，“这一切莫不证明，三国政府曾不得不承认柏林问题与整个德国问题之间存在着密切的关系。同时，这即是说，德国问题，包括柏林问题在内，其解决必须以履行四国一致同意的协定，首先是履行波茨顿宣言及四国关于共管德国之协定为基础。由于美英法政府对波茨顿协定及四国关于德国问题之其他协定采取了最严重的破坏行为，因此，他们就应对德国与柏林所已发生的情势负责。”
    照会于驳斥美英法政府硬说“柏林业已发生一种构成对国际和平与安全之威胁的情势”为毫无根据后宣称，鉴于美英法政府将柏林形势问题递交联合国安理会讨论，“苏联政府认为必须发表下列声明：（甲）柏林形势问题与整个德国问题，以及分裂德国、建立西德分裂政府问题密切相关根，据联合国宪章第一百零七条，应由负责占领德国之四国政府解决之。（乙）美国政府声言已发生威胁国际和平与安全的形势，这一声明与实际情况不符，这只是施用压力的手段，企图利用联合国组织达到其侵略目的。（丙）苏联政府建议：应承认八月三十日给予四国总督的训令为苏美英法四国政府间的协议，柏林形势应以此为基础加以调整。（丁）苏联政府建议：根据波茨顿协定，召开外长会议，以讨论柏林形势及整个德国问题。”
