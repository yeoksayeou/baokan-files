　　Passing Troops Should Not Only Eat White Flour; Grain Coupons Should Be Unified

Editor:
    Some passing troops, when staying and being provided meals in Huolu, Nanbeihuzhuang, reject the common meals (pancakes, vegetable rice) provided by the masses as soon as they see them, saying they have fine grain coupons and ask the village cadres to find them flour. The village cadres find this very difficult. On the one hand, the harvest is not good, and on the other hand, it is the busy autumn season, and the masses have no time to grind wheat flour. This has happened four or five times. They don't say which unit they are from, and there is no way to raise the issue with their leaders, and the masses are unhappy.

    Are the Taiyue area's grain coupons calculated according to the old scale? According to the cadres of Xinzhai Village in this district, the passing troops who have Taiyue grain coupons insist on receiving grain according to the old scale. The village cadres explain that the superiors have already instructed that grain coupons must be paid according to the market scale. They refuse to listen and insist on the old scale, otherwise the coupons will not be valid. The village cadres have no choice but to pay according to the old scale. As a result, when offsetting at the supply station, it is still calculated according to the new scale, which is a great loss to the masses.

    We hope the leaders will investigate the above two points and whether the grain coupons can be unified.

### 过路军人不应光吃白面　使用粮票应当统一

　　过路军人不应光吃白面　使用粮票应当统一编辑同志：
    有个别过往部队，经获鹿、南北胡庄住宿派饭吃，群众送去家常饭（饼子、菜饭），部队一见嫌坏，即将饭退回，并说有细粮票，叫村干给找面吃。村干对此很为难，一方面年景不好，另一方面正在秋忙，群众哪有时间磨麦子面？这样情形已有四、五次。他们也不说是哪一部分，也无法向其负责人提意见，群众反映不好。
    太岳区的粮票是否按老秤计？据本区新寨村干部谈，过路部队拿太岳粮票，强调按老秤支粮食。村干部说明上级已早有指示，粮票一定按市秤支付。他们不听，非按老秤不可，否则用了不算帐。村干无法，只得按老秤支给。结果到供应站抵消，仍按新秤，这样群众吃亏太大。
    以上两条望领导上检查一下，粮票是否可统一起来？
