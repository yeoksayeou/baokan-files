Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 9th. When Luochuan City in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region issued poverty relief production loans, the loans achieved good results due to thorough investigation and meticulous organizational leadership. The total loan amount was 26.57 million yuan, which began to be issued on August 16th. A month before the issuance, the municipal government and the Women's Federation jointly began to visit poor people. After understanding the situation, they summoned the directors of various administrative villages and poor households for house-by-house research. Based on the conditions of genuine difficulty, diligent production, and no bad habits, after repeated investigations and discussions, 39 households in urgent need of loans were finally determined. Before the loan was issued, the households receiving loans were divided into production teams, and each household formulated a plan, which was reviewed by everyone to determine the loan amount according to the plan. In the process of visiting, evaluating, and formulating plans, production education was repeatedly carried out to publicize that the purpose of the loan was to support production, not simply to provide living relief, to prevent ideas such as relying on the government to sit idle and eat, and to strictly prohibit using loans for illegal business and reckless waste. According to the city government's house-by-house inspection on August 30th, the loan has been fully invested in production and has already made a profit. For example, Si Canghe in Dongjie Administrative Village obtained a loan of 2 million yuan, using 1 million yuan to buy four piglets, 400,000 yuan to buy a wheat grinder to sell steamed buns, and 600,000 yuan to buy 200 jin of rice to brew vinegar, using the mash to feed the pigs. Two months later, the four pigs are estimated to be sold for 2.4 to 2.5 million yuan, and the vinegar can be sold for more than 1.4 million yuan. In addition, the profit from selling steamed buns can maintain the livelihood of the whole family of two. The loan does not charge interest, and the term of use is temporarily set at three to five months. The production team leader inspects once every half a month, and the municipal government inspects once a month to ensure that the loan is truly invested in production and can be borrowed and repaid.

　　洛川发放贫民贷款
    全部用到生产上
    【新华社西北九日电】陕甘宁边区洛川市发放贫民生产贷款时，由于调查深入，组织领导方法细致，因此贷款达到良好效果。贷款共计二千六百五十七万元，于八月十六日开始发放。发放之前一个月，市政府即与妇联会共同着手访问贫民，在了解情况后又召集各行政村主任、各贫户逐户进行研究，根据真正困难、勤劳生产、没有不良嗜好等条件，经反复调查与讨论，最后确定急应贷款户为三十九户。放款之前，又将得贷款户分编生产小组，各户制订计划，由大家评议按计划确定贷款数目。在访问评议、订计划过程中，曾反复进行生产教育，宣传贷款目的为了扶助生产，绝非单纯的生活救济，防止依赖政府坐吃山空等思想，严禁以贷款做违法生意及胡花浪费。据市府八月三十日逐户检查，贷款已全部投入生产并已获利。如东街一行政村斯苍合，获贷款二百万，以一百万买小猪四只，以四十万买麦磨面卖馍，以六十万买米酿醋二百斤，糟子喂猪。两月后四个猪估计可卖二百四五十万，醋可卖一百四十多万，另外卖馍所赚，可维持全家两口人生活。该项贷款不取利息，使用期暂定为三个月至五个月，生产小组长半月检查一次，市府一月检查一次，以使贷款真正投入生产，做到有借有还。
