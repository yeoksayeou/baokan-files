Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th—Introduction to the Kuomintang regular troops annihilated in Jinan: (1) Reorganized 73rd Division – Formerly the Kuomintang direct lineage 73rd Army (under the jurisdiction of the 15th, 77th, and 93rd Divisions), it was completely annihilated along with the 46th Division in the famous Laiwu Campaign in February of last year. In June of the same year, Wang Yaowu in Jinan gathered the remnants, and reorganized and rebuilt the 73rd Army (under the jurisdiction of the 15th, 36th, and 77th Divisions) with the special task force of the Second Pacification Zone and the independent brigade of the 73rd Army, which was formed by incorporating the puppet army of traitor Zhang Tianzuo. In February of this year, it was reorganized into a division again, with Cao Zhenduo as the division commander, under the jurisdiction of the 15th and 77th Brigades, equipped with semi-American weaponry. (2) Reorganized 2nd Division – Formed in January of this year by drawing and combining the 213th Brigade of the Reorganized 45th Division and the 57th Brigade of the Reorganized 74th Division. After repeated adjustments to the establishment, it now has under its jurisdiction the 211th and 213th Brigades (note that the 211th Brigade was completely annihilated and rebuilt by us in the Jiaohe Campaign in October of last year), equipped with some American and Japanese weaponry, with Yan Zifeng as the division commander, under the command of the Reorganized 96th Army. (3) 19th Brigade and 57th Brigade – The 19th Brigade belongs to the Reorganized 83rd Division. In July of the year before last, at the beginning of the Liberation War, this brigade was first annihilated by us in Taixing City and Xuanjiabao. After being rebuilt, it was repeatedly annihilated by us in regiments and battalions (its 57th Regiment was annihilated twice). During the Jiaoji West Section Campaign in March of this year, the brigade was in Shijiusuo, hundreds of miles away from the battlefield, but due to fear of our army's power, it fled south by sea on April 4th. In mid-August of this year, it was airlifted to Jinan from Xuzhou. The 57th Brigade originally belonged to the Reorganized 74th Division. After the entire army of the Reorganized 74th Division was wiped out in the Menglianggu Campaign in May of last year, it was rebuilt in June, with its 57th Brigade reorganized from the Qingdao Garrison 2nd and 3rd Brigades. In the Battle of Dongxiagezhuang, southwest of Laiyang in December, the 170th Regiment of this brigade was completely annihilated by our local armed forces. After reorganization and replenishment, it was assigned to the establishment of the rebuilt Reorganized 32nd Division in January of this year. In August of this year, it was airlifted to Jinan from Jimo.
