Xinhua News Agency, Liaoxi Front, Urgent Telegram, 0800 hours, 28th: The five armies and twelve divisions led by Liao Yaoxiang, surrounded in the Heishan and Dahushan areas, were completely eliminated this morning. These five armies and twelve divisions consisted of two divisions of the New 1st Army, three divisions of the New 3rd Army, two divisions of the New 6th Army, two divisions of the 71st Army, one division of the 49th Army, another division under the command of the 49th Army, and one brigade of the 207th Division. Liao Yaoxiang's armies, known for their elite status, collapsed at the first touch in battle and were in a state of utter disarray. The captured officers and soldiers became a sea of people. Six division commanders have already been identified among the prisoners. American-made vehicles, artillery, and ammunition are piled up everywhere on the battlefield. The masses of the people and the People's Liberation Army are united as one on the battlefield, with thunderous cheers.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th: The people of Northeast China are today once again celebrating the immense victory of the People's Liberation Army in annihilating the twelve divisions led by Liao Yaoxiang. In two weeks, this is the third major victory on the Northeast battlefield, following the liberation of Jinzhou on the 15th and the liberation of Changchun on the 19th, and is the largest of the three victories. The three victories have resulted in the Kuomintang losing a total of twenty-six newly reorganized divisions. Together with other annihilated special forces and miscellaneous units, the total number reaches 300,000. Adding this number to the losses suffered by the Kuomintang army in our army's autumn offensive in various battlefields within the passes, the total reaches 450,000. Of the five armies led by Liao Yaoxiang, with the exception of the 49th Army, all were "famous" American-equipped units, especially the New 1st Army and the New 6th Army. Of the three divisions of the New 3rd Army, two divisions were drawn from the New 1st Army and the New 6th Army. The New 38th Division, another American-equipped division of the New 1st Army, was incorporated into the New 7th Army and has already surrendered in Changchun. The remaining Chiang armies in the Northeast, excluding the eleven divisions in Jinxi, still have nine divisions in and around Shenyang and the Yingkou area, namely one division of the New 1st Army, two divisions of the 52nd Army, three divisions of the 53rd Army, two brigades of the 207th Division, and the Provisional 51st Division.

    【新华社辽西前线二十八日八时急电】被包围于黑山、打虎山地区的廖耀湘所率五个军十二个师，已于今晨全部解决。该五个军十二个师为新一军两个师、新三军三个师、新六军两个师、七十一军两个师、四十九军一个师及归四十九军指挥的另一个师，与二零七师一个旅。素称精锐的廖耀湘所率各军，在作战中一触即溃，狼狈不堪。俘虏官兵变成了人山人海。在俘虏中已查出师长六名。美国制造的汽车、大炮、军火在战场上到处堆积。战场上人民群众与解放军联成一片，欢声雷动。
    【新华社哈尔滨二十八日电】东北人民今日又以狂欢来听取辽西前线解放军歼灭廖耀湘所率十二个师的巨大胜利。在两个星期中，这是继十五日锦州解放、十九日长春解放以后东北战场上的第三个大胜利，并且是三个胜利中最大的一个胜利。三次胜利使国民党丧失新整二十六个师，连同其他被歼特种部队和杂牌部队，其总数目达三十万人。此数加上关内各战场国民党军在我军秋季攻势中所受的损失合计，则达四十五万人之谱。廖耀湘所率五个军中，除四十九军外都是“著名”的美械化部队，特别是新一军和新六军。新三军的三个师中，有两个师是由新一军和新六军中抽出来的。新一军的另一个美械师新三十八师，编入新七军，已在长春投降。东北蒋军现除锦西有十一个师外，在沈阳及其外围直至营口地区尚有九个师，即新一军一个师、五十二军两个师、五十三军三个师、二零七师两个旅、与暂五十一师。
