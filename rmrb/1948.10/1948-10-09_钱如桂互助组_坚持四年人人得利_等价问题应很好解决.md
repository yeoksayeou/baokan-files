[Jilu Yu Electric] Qian Rugui Mutual Aid Group has persisted for four years, gradually improving, and everyone has become prosperous. Qian Rugui is a labor hero from Houshangu, Guancheng First District. His mutual aid group has persisted for more than four years and has been developing from small to large because it has achieved increased production and benefits for everyone. After the anti-black land campaign in the autumn of 1944, under the call of the superiors, Qian Rugui, Hao Liye, and other seven families contributed three dou of wheat each and bought flour mills and utensils to grind flour together. They had a clear division of labor in production and did very well, earning some money and saving grain. In the spring of 1945, they jointly cultivated the land, and at the wheat harvest, they harvested faster than other households due to mutual assistance, taking advantage of the spare time to hoe thirty-four cartloads of wheat stubble. Under their influence, eleven groups were established in the whole village. At the same time, because their mutual assistance was good, hoeing was timely, the number of hoeing passes was high, and more manure was applied, income increased. According to Qian Rugui's own calculation, that year's autumn grain yield increased by three shi, one dou, and five sheng compared to previous years, cotton by eighteen jin, and sweet potatoes by three thousand three hundred jin. Therefore, Qian Rugui bought three mu of land that year, and Sun Houyi from his group also bought seven mu of land. After the autumn, his group continued to engage in sideline production. In addition to grinding flour, they saved two jin of grain per household per person per day in sideline production such as selling sugar and oil. This year, after the wheat harvest, the superiors inspected the work and proposed a work point system. The group discussed and accepted it, but did not persist. After the flood in 1946, other groups in the village disbanded, but Qian Rugui's group continued to cooperate well. Some people came to join his group, and the group expanded to twenty-one households. In order to facilitate work, they were divided into four subgroups to produce separately. This spring, another six households joined his group and were divided into another subgroup. Why has Qian Rugui's group been able to cooperate for such a long time? The reasons are as follows: (1) Achieving "mutual benefit" and "increased production." His group started with sideline mutual aid and felt the benefits, then proceeded to agricultural mutual aid. Each household received actual benefits, so they were willing to continue the mutual aid. (2) Voluntary combination, maintaining a relatively equivalent situation. Withdrawal from or joining production is free. In terms of equivalent value, this group's work point system did not persist. On the one hand, there were problems with the work point calculation method, and the leadership did not pay attention to timely improvement. On the other hand, the labor of each household was about the same, and the result of their annual work point calculation was not a large profit or loss. For example, Sun Decai and Sun Dekui's cattle were a little smaller, but their manpower was stronger; Qian Rugui was a small district cadre and sometimes missed work, but he had a full set of larger furniture. Everyone knew their own advantages and disadvantages. Those who benefited took the initiative to provide a few meals for others when working. (It is difficult to maintain this situation regularly and persistently. If the equivalent work point and labor conversion problems are not solved, the mutual aid group will be difficult to improve and consolidate, and may even collapse. - Editor) (3) Those who did well were praised in the group; those who did not do well or made mistakes, the group leader could promptly advise them to correct through individual conversations. (4) Good planning, no waste of labor, and promotion of democracy. During production, they sat together at dinner every day to discuss what work to do tomorrow, how to divide shifts, how much work, how many people to go, and who to take care of first. They discussed and then worked without wasting any time. (5) Good care after business trips. After someone went on a business trip, the group did their work as if it were their own, so everyone was very satisfied. In order to enable Qian Rugui's group to improve on this basis, comrades from the work team have helped to review why the work point system failed in the past. There are the following points: 1. The work points were recorded in an account book, but everyone was illiterate, and they had to find a teacher to calculate the work points every day, which was too troublesome. 2. The labor conversion was too fixed, not based on market prices and the nature of the work. It was inappropriate to calculate a full-time laborer at three jin of grain per day. 3. The labor was not divided into good and bad, and regardless of the quality of the work, it was unreasonable to give everyone twenty work points per day. 4. The accounts were settled once a year, not seasonally in stages. 5. Owed labor and long-term labor were not resolved uniformly through the group, but by group members with each other, which was embarrassing. After reviewing, everyone felt the need to clarify the work points and immediately discussed and implemented a work ticket system, which has now begun to be implemented.

Editor's Note: Judging from the situation and history of this mutual aid group, it is liked by the masses and is relatively suitable for the needs of the masses, but it is relatively primitive and elementary. The task of the leaders is to help the masses summarize experience, study methods for consolidation and improvement, solve the problems of work point calculation and labor conversion, seek to earnestly implement equivalent value, and conduct education on organization based on the masses' awareness, so that it can be gradually improved and developed.

### 钱如桂互助组　坚持四年人人得利　等价问题应很好解决

　　钱如桂互助组
    坚持四年人人得利
    等价问题应很好解决
    【冀鲁豫电】钱如桂互助组坚持四年，逐渐提高，人人发家致富。钱如桂是观城一区后山谷的劳动英雄，他的互助组因作到了增产人人有利，一直坚持了四年多，并一直是由小到大的向上发展着。一九四四年秋反黑地后，在上级号召下，钱如桂和郝立业等七家各对了麦子三斗，买了粉磨及用具等，在一块磨粉。具体分工生产，闹的很好，赚了些钱省了粮食。到一九四五年春合伙种地，收麦时由于互助，比别的户收的快，趁空铲了三十四车麦茬。在他们的影响下，全村有十一个组成立了。同时由于他们互助好，锄地及时，锄的遍数多，粪上的多，就增加了收入。单就钱如桂一人计算，那年比往年增收秋粮三石一斗五升，棉花十八斤，红薯三千三百斤。因此当年钱如桂就买地三亩，他组的孙后义也买了七亩地。秋后他组又继续进行副业生产，除磨粉外，又在卖糖、油等副业生产中，每天每家每人可省二斤粮食。这年麦后上级检查工作，提出计工意见，组内讨论接受，但没坚持下去。四六年水淹后，村上别的组解散了，钱如桂组还是互助的很好。有些人就来参加他这组，这组就扩大到廿一户。为了做活方便，又分为四个小组，分头生产。至今春又有六户参加他这组，随着又分了一个小组。为什么钱如桂组能互助这样长时期呢？原因有以下几点：（一）做到了“互助两利”与“增产”。他组成立的开始，是从副业互助搞起的，感觉有好处，又进行农业互助。各户都得到实际好处，所以他们愿意互助下去。（二）自愿结合，保持比较等价的情形。在生产中退出或加入是自由的。等价方面这组计工没坚持下来，一方面是计工方法上有毛病，领导上没注意及时提高；另一方面各户劳力差不多少，他们一年计工的结果盈亏不大。如孙德才、孙德奎的牛小一点，但人力强；钱如桂当小区干部，有时误点活，但大些家具全套都有。他们各人心里都有数，沾光者在做活时就主动的管别人几顿饭。（这样很难经常持久，等价计工折工问题不解决，互助组就很难提高、巩固，甚至有垮台的可能。——编者）（三）做得好的，在组内有表扬；做得不好或有什么错误，组长能及时经过个别谈话，劝其改正。（四）计划好不浪费工，发扬民主。生产时他们每天晚饭时在一块坐坐，商量明天干啥活？怎样分班，多大活，去几个人？先弄谁的？大家商量好就去干，一点也不浪费工夫。（五）出差后照顾得好。谁出差后，组内对他的活做得象自己的活一样，因此大家都很满意。为了使钱如桂组在此基础上提高一步，已由工作组同志帮助，对过去计工为什么失败做了检讨，有这样几点：一、记工是用帐本记，大家不识字，每天计工得找先生，都嫌麻烦。二、折工太固定，不是按市价与活来定，整劳力一天都按三斤粮食不合适。三、劳力不分好坏，不论做活粗细，都按一天二十分工不合理。四、算帐一年一结，没按季分段。五、欠工长工不是通过组统一解决，而由组员与组员解决，不好意思。经过检讨后，大家都觉得需要明确计工，随即商量了实行工票制的办法，现已开始执行。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：从这个互助组的情况和历史来看，它是为群众所喜爱是比较适合群众需要的，但是比较原始和低级的。领导者的任务即在于帮助群众总结经验，研究巩固提高办法，解决计工折工问题，求得认真实行等价。并根据群众觉悟进行组织起来的教育，这样即可逐步提高发展。
