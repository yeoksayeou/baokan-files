Delivering Public Grain in Willow Forest Village

    The gongs clang and clang,
    The masses of Willow Forest Village gather in the south field,
    Some squat, some sit,
    The children climb in the willow trees.
      ★
    The Farmers' Association director holds his dry tobacco pouch,
    Gesturing as he speaks:
    "The front and rear are one general front,
    The People's Liberation Army and the people are of one heart;
    After crossing the Yellow River, we'll cross the Yangtze River,
    Everyone quickly hand in the public grain."
      ★
    Old Man Liu stands up from the crowd,
    Stepping forward past everyone;
    "We've farmed the land our whole lives,
    Hauling the harvested grain to the landlord's house,
    The landlord lives in a building and eats white flour,
    While we get a bowl of thin gruel;
    Now it's our own village and our own land,
    Our own grain and our own granary,
    Never hoarded grain in our lives,
    Like our eldest daughter getting married for the first time.
    Who gave us this good life?
    Everyone think back......."
      ★
    Aunt Zhang hugs her hands to her chest,
    Waddling to the center of the field:
    "I propose we all grind early grain,
    The rice must be grain by grain,
    Without sand and without bran."
      ★
    "Agreed, Aunt Zhang!"
    "Support Aunt Zhang!"
      ★
    "I also have a small suggestion,
    The cloth bags should be the same from top to bottom,
    The surface and the bottom should be the same....."
    When everyone heard this,
    The old men laughed and stroked their beards,
    The women laughed and called out to their mothers!
    "Aunt Zhang, Aunt Zhang,
    You still have an old brain,
    That's what the old feudal landlords did,
    The masses don't have that kind of bad thinking."
    Aunt Zhang, Aunt Zhang,
    Smiling, her face glowing red........

    Everyone is busy in Willow Forest Village,
    The animals of Willow Forest Village are turning in a hurry,
    Willow Forest Village is busy day and night,
    To the east, the millstone grinds "sha sha sha,"
    To the west, the winnowing fan hums,
    We walked all over the streets and alleys,
    Every household is busy with public grain.
    The moon is a lamp for Willow Forest Village,
    Shining brightly on the grinding yards of Willow Forest Village,
    The men push the millstone, the women fan,
    Chatting and laughing as they grind the public grain........
      ★
    The sky is full of stars, the ground is full of frost,
    The masses of Willow Forest Village are delivering public grain,
    Hei Wa is eager to get ahead,
    Carrying the cloth bag, he runs to the south field,
    Seeing that everyone has arrived early,
    Loading, measuring,
    Busy with our old village chief.
    Donkeys and mules bray loudly,
    Stretching for half a mile,
    Cloth bags on the backs of livestock,
    With a shout, they leave the village,
    The whip cracks in the air,
    "Da da" "Lie lie" they cross Willow Forest Ridge......

　　柳林庄上送公粮

    锣声响呀响镗镗，
    柳林庄的群众聚集在南场，
    有的＠蹴有的坐，
    娃娃们爬在柳树上。
      ★
    农会主任拿着旱烟袋，
    一面比划一面讲：
    “前方后方一条总战线，
    解放军老百姓一条心；
    打过黄河打长江，
    大家赶快交公粮。”
      ★
    人群中立起刘老汉，
    跨过众人往前站；
    “咱养种一辈子地，
    打下粮食往地主家里扛，
    地主住楼房吃白面，
    咱端的一碗稀糊汤；
    如今自己的庄子自己的地，
    自己的粮食自己的仓，
    哪辈子也没囤过谷，
    大闺女上轿头一趟。
    谁给咱这好光景？
    大伙往回想一想………”
      ★
    张大娘两手胸前抱，
    圪扭圪扭走到场中央：
    “俺提议都碾早谷子，
    米要一粒一粒，
    不带沙子不粘糠。”
      ★
    “同意张大娘！”
    “拥护张大娘！”
      ★
    “俺还有个小意见，
    布袋要顶底能相照，
    浮面脚底要一样………”
    大伙听了这句话，
    老汉们笑得摸胡子，
    妇女们笑得直叫娘！
    “张大娘呀张大娘，
    你还是老脑筋，
    那是封建老财们办的事，
    群众哪有那号坏思想。”
    张大娘呀张大娘，
    笑得满脸放红光………
　
　　　　　　二
　
    柳林庄里人人忙，
    柳林庄的牲口转的慌，
    柳林庄里明地黑夜忙，
    到东头，碾盘沙沙沙，
    来西头，扇车嗡嗡响，
    大街小巷都走遍，
    家家户户都忙公粮。
    月亮是柳林庄的一盏灯，
    照见柳林庄的碾院明亮亮，
    汉们推碾娘们扇，
    有说有笑碾公粮………
      ★
    满天星斗满地霜，
    柳林庄的群众送公粮，
    黑娃一心想往头里赶，
    扛上布袋跑南场，
    一看众人早来到，
    装的装，量的量，
    忙煞咱们老村长。
    驴呀骡呀嚎嚎叫，
    足足拖到半里长，
    布袋驮上牲口背，
    一声吆喝出了庄，
    鞭梢空中“叭叭”响，
    “嗒嗒”“咧咧”翻过了柳林岗……
