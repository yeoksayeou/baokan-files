　　North Yue Area Holds Expanded Cadre Meetings
  　Correct Attitude Towards Policy Implementation
  　Conduct Criticism and Self-Criticism, Criticize Many Confused Ideas
    [North Yue Telegram] The North Yue Area Party Committee convened an expanded cadre meeting in early August to convey and discuss the tasks of completing land reform in the autumn and winter (land reform in newly liberated areas of Yanbei and Chahar South), party rectification, and production work. Subsequently, each sub-area also convened expanded cadre meetings, which concluded on the 10th of this month.
    The main achievement of the meetings in various localities was a clearer understanding of policies, overcoming many confused ideas, and correcting the attitude towards policy implementation in the future. For example: (1) When examining production leadership, it was acknowledged that only general effort had been used to lead production in the past, and it was not truly valued. The idea that "the masses will produce even without leadership" was the root of this bias. It was clearly stated that in the future, production leadership must be done well in all regions, and all work must be closely centered around and combined with production work. It would be a grave mistake if other work seriously affected mass production. (2) When discussing the issue of compensating middle peasants whose interests had been violated, there were two biases. One was that "middle peasants only ask to change their class status; it doesn't matter whether their movable property is returned." "Persuade the middle peasant, and if he has no objections, then it's settled." There were also those who were unwilling to face this serious fact, saying, "Not much violation has occurred in our area." These were all serious laissez-faire ideas. The other bias was advocating "regardless of whether the movable property has been distributed or not, whatever was struggled for should be returned." "Let the village share the burden of compensation." "Tell the poor peasants to compensate with grain or labor after the autumn harvest." And advocating "completely changing the land distributed to poor peasants from middle peasants into a landlord-tenant relationship." After heated debate, ideas converged, and it was believed that there should be a firm attitude towards compensating middle peasants. In principle, movable property should be returned, but the situation should also be specifically analyzed. Undistributed property should be resolutely returned, and distributed property should be compensated for in other ways as much as possible, to achieve rural unity and better develop production. (3) On the issue of settling landlords and rich peasants, some comrades mistakenly believed that they were "wrongly struggled" in the past or that "the policy has changed." After detailed discussion, it was completely clarified that the purpose of land reform was to eliminate feudal exploitation and liberate productive forces, not to eliminate the physical bodies of landlords. Therefore, they should be given a way out in life and allowed to turn to labor. Land reform in the North Yue Area has now been basically completed, but some remaining problems still exist and must be properly resolved. (4) When discussing democratic work style and the mass line, some comrades believed that "in guerrilla areas, it is indeed necessary to beat people to get work done, and the beating must be focused, so that one beating serves as a warning to a hundred, in order to complete the task"; others believed that "to overcome tailism, one cannot listen to the opinions of the people," and that "overcoming coercion and commandism will inevitably lead to laissez-faire." After discussion, these views were all criticized. Everyone agreed that beating and scolding the masses, under any pretext, was extremely wrong and not allowed. The completion of our tasks mainly relies on persuasion and mobilization, on raising the awareness of the masses, and on the exemplary leading role of party members, supplemented by appropriate organizational methods. It is wrong to listen to the opinions of the masses without analysis or not to listen to the opinions of the masses at all, and it will inevitably repeat the mistakes of tailism or coercion and commandism. It is only right to resolutely lead and implement the correct opinions of the masses, and to educate and correct the incorrect opinions.
    In their self-criticism, the cadres attending the Fourth District meeting unanimously admitted that they had been irresolute in correcting deviations in the past, using the excuse that "the masses' thinking was not clear," and they also admitted that the "rather left than right" thinking had caused serious damage to their work. At the meeting, both the District Party Committee and the County Party Committee conducted a review of their leadership since the land reform. In its self-criticism, the District Party Committee believed that the phenomena of fatigue, complacency, and indifference were very serious, coupled with irresolute policy implementation, unauthorized actions, and other states of disorganization and indiscipline; insufficient understanding of the situation below, and failure to regularly report to and seek instructions from higher levels in a timely manner, resulting in a lack of definite views, wavering, and a lack of criticism and self-criticism, making it impossible to solve problems in a timely manner and other undesirable work styles. This was the root cause of the failure to complete many tasks during a period. Later, Lingshou, Jingxing, Huolu... and other counties and districts also reviewed the mistake of being independent. For example, the Lingshou County Party Committee decided to move the movable property of wealthy middle peasants, and only asked for instructions from higher levels after the deployment and implementation. The Jingxing County Party Committee, due to differences of opinion with the District Party Committee, adopted a delaying and refusing attitude towards the District Party Committee's decision, and failed to earnestly convey the District Party Committee's instructions on the Gui Li beating people to death incident to the lower levels. In addition, Pingshan, Huolu, Jianping... and other counties have all made mistakes such as privately using public grain. The meeting conducted severe criticism of these phenomena.

### 北岳各分区开扩干会议　端正执行政策态度　开展批评自我批评，批判许多糊涂思想

　　北岳各分区开扩干会议
  　端正执行政策态度
  　开展批评自我批评，批判许多糊涂思想
    【北岳电】北岳区党委于八月初召开扩干会议，传达与讨论秋冬结束土改（雁北察南部分新区进行土改）整党生产工作。会后，各分区亦先后召开扩干会议，会议于本月十日先后结束。
    各地大会主要收获，是对政策的认识更加明确了，克服了许多糊涂思想，端正了今后执行政策的态度。如：（一）检查生产领导时，承认以往只用一般精力领导生产，实际上并未真正重视起来。“群众不用领导也会生产”的思想，就是这种偏向的根源。明确提出今后不论任何地区，都要把生产领导好，一切工作都要密切围绕与结合生产工作进行。如因进行其他工作而严重影响群众生产的，则是莫大的错误。（二）在讨论补偿被侵犯中农问题时，存在两种偏向，一种认为“中农只要求改变成份，浮财退不退都可以。”“劝说劝说中农，他没意见也就算了。”还有不愿正视这一严重实事的，说：“这样办，我区侵犯的不多。”这些都是严重的自流放任思想。另一种是主张“不管浮财已否分配，斗争什么退什么。”“由村中摊着补”。“叫贫农秋后用粮食补或用劳力补。”以及主张“把贫农分了中农的地完全改成租佃关系。”后经热烈争论，思想才趋一致，认为补偿中农应有坚决态度。浮财原则上要退，但也要具体分析情况处理。未分的坚决退还，已分的尽量从其他方面设法补偿，以达到农村团结，更好的发展生产的目的。（三）在安置地富问题上，有的同志误解为过去是“斗错了”或是“政策变了”。详加讨论后，才完全弄清土改目的是为了消灭封建剥削，解放生产力，并不是要消灭地主的肉体，因此应在生活上给予出路，使其转向劳动。现在北岳区土改已基本完成，但仍存在若干遗留问题，必须适当予以解决。（四）讨论民主作风和群众路线时，有的同志认为“在游击区搞工作，确实不打不行，打要有重点的打，以便打一警百，才能完成任务”；还有的认为“要克服尾巴主义，就不能听老百姓的话”，以及“克服强迫命令，必须会走上放任自流”等错误说法。讨论后，这些观点都受到批驳。大家一致认为不论任何借口作掩护，打骂群众行动，都是极端错误的，不允许的。我们任务的完成，主要依靠说服动员，依靠群众觉悟的提高，依靠党员的模范带头作用，再以适当的组织方法，加以组织。不加分析的听从群众意见或不听群众意见的做法，都是不对的，必然会重犯尾巴主义或强迫命令的错误，只有对群众正确意见坚决领导实现，不正确意见则进行教育改正，才是对的。
    四分区到会干部检讨中，一致承认过去借口“群众思想搞不通”而纠偏不坚决，并检讨“宁左勿右”思想给了工作以严重损害。会上地委县委都对土改以来的领导进行了检查。地委自我检讨中，认为疲塌自满满不在乎的老大现象很严重，加以执行政策不坚决，自作主张等无组织无纪律状态；对下情不够了解，又未能及时向上级经常报告请示，以致在重要问题上缺乏定见，动摇，缺乏批评与自我批评，不能及时解决问题等不良作风。这就是一时期很多工作未能完成任务的根源。以后灵寿、井陉、获鹿……等县区也都检讨了闹独立性的错误。如灵寿县委决定动富裕中农的浮财问题，布置执行后才请示上级。井陉县委因与地委意见分歧，即对地委的决定采取拖延拒绝态度，不把地委对桂理乱打死人事件之指示认真向下传达。此外平山、获鹿、建屏……等县，都曾发生私自动用公粮等错误。大会对这些现象，都进行了严厉的批评。
