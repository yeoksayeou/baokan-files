　　Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 9th -- The Luoyang Public Security Bureau, with the assistance of the people, recently cracked a major case involving Kuomintang bandit secret agents who printed fake "Zhongzhou banknotes" to disrupt the financial system and engage in economic and military conspiracies. Criminals, including Wu Chunxuan, appointed "Commander of the Yu-Xi Bandit Suppression General Headquarters" by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Army Headquarters Zhengzhou Command Post, "Deputy Commander" Dong Zhusan, "Detachment Leaders" Xu Hongyuan and Sun Haiting, "Chief of Military Law and Secretary-General" Song Lizhong, and "Chief of Logistics" Guo Kunshan, and more than thirty other individuals have all been arrested. Confiscated were a certificate of special agent from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Ministry of National Defense, a secret dispatch order, a radio station, a set of documents, three pistols, a lithographic printing press, three lithographic plates, two printing plates for fake "Zhongzhou banknotes," and all related equipment such as ink, pigments, rulers, brushes, and paper. Investigations revealed that the bandit Wu and his accomplices were Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents from Luonan who, over the years, persecuted the people for the Kuomintang reactionary forces, extorted and plundered, and committed all kinds of atrocities such as murder and robbery. This summer, on July 23rd, the bandit leader Wu Chunxuan and others, under the orders of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Ministry of National Defense and the Army Headquarters Zhengzhou Command Post, and under the direction of the Chiang Kai-shek party secret service in Zhengzhou, sneaked into Luoyang City, gathered bandits, and colluded with big ruffians like Dong Zhusan to carry out anti-people sabotage activities in a planned manner, reaching more than ten instances. In order to carry out huge economic and military conspiracies, the bandits originally planned to counterfeit 500-yuan Ji'nan banknotes, but failed due to the ineffectiveness of the chemicals. They then switched to printing Zhongzhou banknotes worth about 5,000 silver dollars to disrupt the financial system and use them as funds for military conspiracies. They also colluded with Xu Hongyuan, the head of the Jiugongdao sect from eleven counties including Linru, using the name of religion to deceive backward elements, buy over local bandits and scattered Chiang Kai-shek bandit military officers and soldiers, local bullies, and vagrants, attempting to organize reactionary armed forces. They planned to sneak into the Longmen area south of Luoyang, attack our democratic government and district and township organs, and flee into the mountains to harass and rob the people, coordinating with secret agents and bandits hidden in Luoyang City to launch riots at opportune moments. After discovering this conspiracy, the City Public Security Bureau arrested them all on August 23rd, sixteen hours before the bandits printed the fake "Zhongzhou banknotes." Due to the conclusive evidence, the criminals confessed to their crimes. After trial by the city government court, except for more than twenty accomplices who were sentenced to imprisonment or released for reform through education, the principal culprits Wu Chunxuan, Dong Zhusan, Xu Hongyuan, Song Lizhong, and Sun Haiting were sentenced to death, and the sentences have been approved by the Yu-Xi Administrative Office. Of the five bandits sentenced to death, Dong died of illness in prison, and the remaining four were executed by firing squad on September 24th.
