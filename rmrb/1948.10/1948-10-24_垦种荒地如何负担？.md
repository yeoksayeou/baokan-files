To the Editor:
    Cultivating wheat is underway in various regions, and there are many wastelands that are difficult to deal with. Some are raw wastelands, and some are cultivated wastelands, but what are the standards for raw and cultivated wastelands? How should they be burdened? Regarding the issue of wasteland ownership, our opinion is: For those deserted for two years or less, the land rights belong to the original owner, and the cultivator should cultivate for at least two years. For wasteland deserted for more than three years, reclamation is laborious and the original owner should be consulted to reclaim it. If the original owner is unable to do so, the land rights should belong to the laborer after reclamation. Is this appropriate?

    Answer:
    I. The method for wasteland burden stipulated by the North China People's Government regarding agricultural tax is:
    　(1) Flat wasteland that has been deserted for three to five years is exempt from tax for two years, and wasteland that has been deserted for six years or more is exempt from tax for three years.
    　(2) Newly built mountain terraces are exempt from tax for three years.
    　(3) Newly built river滩 lands in mountainous areas are exempt from tax for three years from the year they have income.
    II. The standard for so-called raw and cultivated wasteland is one to two years for cultivated wasteland and three years or more for raw wasteland.
    III. Regarding the issue of wasteland land rights, "...consult the original owner for reclamation. If the original owner is unable to do so, the land rights should belong to the laborer after reclamation..." We agree with this spirit. The North China Government will have formal regulations soon.

### 垦种荒地如何负担？

专栏：询问与答复

　　垦种荒地如何负担？编辑同志：
    现在各地正在种麦，有许多荒地不好处理，有些是生荒，有些是熟荒，但生荒熟荒的标准是什么？怎样负担？关于荒地权问题我们意见：荒芜二年以下者，地权归原主人，开垦者至少种二年以上。三年以上的荒地开垦费力，应征求原主人开垦，如原主人无力时，开垦后地权归劳动者所有，这是否妥当？

    答：一、华北人民政府关于农业税规定之荒地负担办法为：
    （１）垦种已荒三年至五年之平荒地免税二年，已荒六年以上者免税三年。
    （２）新修山地梯田免税三年。
    （３）山岳地区新修之河滩地自有收入之年起免税三年。
    二、荒地中所谓生荒熟荒之标准为一年至二年者为熟荒，三年以上者为生荒。
    三、荒地地权问题，“……征求原主开垦，如原主无力时，开垦后地权归劳动者所有……”我们同意这个精神，华北政府不久将有正式规定。
