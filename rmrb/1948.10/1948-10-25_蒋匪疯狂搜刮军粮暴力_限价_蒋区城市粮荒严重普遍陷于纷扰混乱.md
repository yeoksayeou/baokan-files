Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. According to reports from various sources: Under the Kuomintang's frantic scavenging of military grain and violent "price controls," severe grain shortages have plunged major cities in its controlled areas into widespread turmoil and chaos. Citizens of Shanghai have been unable to buy rice and flour since the beginning of this month, and recently it has developed to the point where rice shops are closing and restaurants are suspending business. Rice and flour are both scarce in Beiping, the grain market is sluggish, with more buying than selling. On October 8th, an incident occurred in which wounded soldiers smashed rice shops and the police opened fire to suppress them. The Tianjin grain market is chaotic, and rice, flour, and corn are not easy to buy. Citizens, disregarding the Chiang bandits' martial law, queue up at night to wait until dawn to buy "rationed" grain. In late September, a tragic incident occurred in which two people were crushed to death while抢buying corn flour. Tangshan is experiencing an extreme shortage of grain, and it is impossible to buy even a few kilograms of corn flour after searching the entire city. Corn flour has disappeared from Tanggu, and poor people are eating sweet potatoes to satisfy their hunger. It is impossible to buy a dou of rice or a jin of flour in the open market in Baoding. More than 500 employees of the Fushun Coal Mine held a hunger protest at noon on September 29th. Kaifeng has had no flour to buy since mid-September. On the 16th of this month, an anti-famine demonstration broke out in Qingdao, with more than 10,000 citizens, including women and children, gathering in front of the granary, waving empty bags and shouting slogans demanding flour and other grains.

The cause of the grain shortage, as admitted by Du Jianshi, the Kuomintang mayor of Tianjin, in a telegram to Nanjing, is due to "the local authorities responsible for military supplies purchasing rice and wheat locally" (Reuters Tianjin, 15th). On October 9th, the Tianjin Dagongbao said: The grain shortage was caused by the rigid price controls of "August 19th" and the Kuomintang's widespread "procurement" of military grain. The Dagongbao on October 10th also published a speech by Guan Jiyu, the Kuomintang Minister of Food, in the pseudo-Legislative Yuan, in which he demanded that cities that are militarily isolated, such as Taiyuan and Shenyang, as well as major cities such as Ping, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, "raise their own grain sources." In this way, the grain shortage in major cities in the Kuomintang area will become increasingly serious.

　　蒋匪疯狂搜刮军粮暴力“限价”
  　蒋区城市粮荒严重普遍陷于纷扰混乱
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据各方报导：在国民党疯狂搜刮军粮和暴力“限价”下，严重的粮荒已使其统治区各大城市普遍陷于纷扰混乱。上海市民从本月初起即买不到大米、面粉，最近已发展到米店关门、餐馆停业的地步。北平米、面俱缺，粮食市场萧条，买多卖少。十月八日发生伤兵捣毁米店警察开枪镇压事件。天津粮食市场混乱，米、面、玉米均不易购得。市民为购买“配售”粮食，不顾蒋匪戒严令于晚上排队等候天明。九月下旬已发生因抢买玉米面而挤死两条人命的惨剧。唐山粮食奇缺，走遍全市买不到几斤玉米面。塘沽玉米面绝迹，贫民改食白薯充饥。保定城内公开市场上买不到斗米斤面。抚顺煤矿员工五百余人，于九月二十九日正午举行饥饿请愿。开封从九月中旬起即无面可买。青岛于本月十六日爆发万余市民反粮荒示威，包括妇女儿童的示威行列聚集在粮仓门前，挥舞着空口袋，高呼要求面粉及其他粮食的口号。
    粮荒的造因，据国民党天津市长杜建时在拍往南京的电文中承认，系由于“负责军事供应的地方当局就地采购米麦所引起”（路透社天津十五日电）。十月九日天津大公报说：粮荒系由于“八、一九”的硬性限价及国民党普遍“采购”军粮所造成。十月十日的大公报并刊载国民党粮食部长关吉玉在伪立法院的谈话，他要求军事上孤立的城市如太原、沈阳等地，以及平、津、京、沪、穗各大城市“自筹粮源”。这样，国民党区各大城市的粮荒，势将越来越严重化。
