[Taihang Electric] The Xucun Cooperative in Heshun County grew and strengthened by organizing mass production, but later declined due to a sole focus on profit. Recently, it has gradually recovered after rectification. The cooperative was established in 1943, initially focusing on supplying necessities to the masses. It operated a pharmacy and a dyeing workshop. The manager oversaw the dyeing, and the clerk handled medical consultations and medicine sales. Overhead was low, which greatly benefited the masses. By October, after the third dividend distribution, the share capital had increased to 126,000 yuan. It then absorbed surplus labor to open an oil mill. In 1947, a women's textile cooperative was organized, responsible for supplying raw materials and marketing finished products. As a result, the scope of labor organization gradually expanded, and the relationship between the masses and the cooperative became even closer. In March of that year, a water mill was built, greatly facilitating the people's flour milling. This further freed up the labor and livestock power of the masses, allowing the transportation industry to develop. After the fourth dividend distribution in May, the share capital increased to more than 952,000 yuan, and the masses earned good money from transportation and saltpeter boiling. After the last dividend distribution in 1947, the share capital increased to more than 1.98 million yuan. At that time, the masses believed that the cooperative had become an indispensable reliance for their lives and production. Unfortunately, at this point, the leading cadres became dizzy and lost their way due to the gradual expansion of share capital, relaxing the organization of mass production and moving towards purely for-profit activities. This spring, they bought more than 30 houses in Heshun City (at a price of 100 shi of millet per house, equivalent to 4.2 million yuan in silver dollars), and the village cooperative's pharmacy and dyeing workshop were moved to the city, operating separately from the village cooperative. At this point, the workshops also abandoned part of the organization of surplus labor of both cooperative members and non-members. At the end of May, the village and the city collectively earned a net profit of more than 3 million silver dollars. On the surface, the share capital increased to more than 4 million yuan, but the operating capital and external debts in the city amounted to 3 million yuan; in addition, there was a bank loan of 50,000 yuan and a loan of 150,000 yuan from the village finance, which could not be repaid. Because the scope of the operations was too large, and external debts were too high, the capital turnover became difficult, and the cooperative's business tended to stagnate, leaving the cadres at a loss. At the beginning of August, the masses raised many opinions to the cooperative, saying, "In the past, the cooperative was truly loved by everyone when it led production in the village, but opening a business in the city ruined it. Now the head is bigger than the body, and if you don't change, you won't even be able to keep your capital." In reviewing the painful lessons, the cooperative cadres felt that the opinions of the masses were very good, and they all said that they were determined to rectify the cooperative. The rectification has now been carried out in the following aspects: (1) The business in the city will be resolutely withdrawn to strengthen the business activities of the village cooperative. (2) Mobilizing the masses to clear up external debts has achieved considerable results, with two-thirds already recovered, and the remaining plan is to recover it by organizing mass transportation. (3) The village cooperative's business has fully turned to organizing mass production. Recently, it has bought back daily necessities such as matches and salt, and bought back more than 100 catties of cotton, planning to support women's textile work as it did before. In terms of transportation, a production outlet has been found for the surplus livestock power, with the cooperative contracting the transportation of goods for the Jixi Leather Factory, which can earn more than 9 million silver dollars when all the goods are transported. (4) The staff has been appropriately reduced, the staff treatment has been stipulated, and it has been decided that in the future, employment should be done "based on the need for the job." In the past, wage treatment was stipulated using currency as the standard, but this time it has all been changed to using physical objects as the standard. It has also been stipulated that a portion of the dividends should be drawn from the profits and awarded based on performance.

　　许村合作社的教训
    组织生产得发展搬到城里垮了台
    【太行电】和顺许村合作社，从组织群众生产中发展壮大之后，由于单纯营利而走上垮台，最近经过整顿又逐渐恢复。该社是一九四三年成立起来的，开始经营主要业务是供给群众必需品，开设有药铺染房各一座，经理兼管染布，营业员兼看病卖药，开支很少，给了群众很大利益。到十月份，第三次分红后股金即增至十二万六千元，又吸收剩余劳力开设油坊一座。一九四七年组织妇女纺织合作社，负责供给原料推销成品，因此组织劳力面逐渐扩大，群众与合作社关系更如紧密。是年三月又建设水磨一盘，大大便利了群众磨面。这就使群众劳畜力更加有剩余，运输业得以发展。五月四次分红后，股金即增至九十五万二千余元，群众运输、熬硝均很赚钱。四七年最后一次分红后，股金即增至一百九十八万余元。是时群众认为合作社已成为自己生活与生产上不可缺乏的依靠。可惜此时领导干部因股金逐渐扩大而冲昏头脑迷失方向，放松了组织群众生产，走向单纯营利；今春到和顺城买了房子卅余间，（房价小米一百石，折大洋四百廿万元）；将村社的药铺、染房移至城内，与村社分别经营。至此作坊也放弃了部分社员与非社员剩余劳力的组织，五月底结帐，村与城共净赚洋三百余万元。表面看来股金虽增至四百余万元，但城内营业上占本及外欠两项即三百万元；此外尚有银行贷款五万元，借村财政款十五万余元，无法归还。因摆的摊子过大，外欠太多，资金周转不开，合作社营业即趋于停顿，干部苦无办法。八月初群众给合作社提出了许多意见，都说：“过去合作社在村里领导生产时真是人人爱，就是到城里开了生意闹坏了；现在是头比身子大，再不转变，连老本也保不住。”合作社干部在检讨痛苦教训中，感到群众的意见很好，都说要下决心把合作社整顿起来。现已从以下几方面进行了整顿：（一）城内买卖坚决撤回，以加强村社业务活动。（二）发动群众清理外欠成绩不小，已收回三分之二，下余计划从组织群众运输中收回。（三）村社业务已全力转向组织群众生产，最近已从外面买回一部火柴食盐等必需品，并买回棉花百余斤，计划仍象去年以前一样的去扶助妇女纺织。在运输方面给剩余畜力找了生产门路，由合作社包揽冀西皮革厂运货，全部运完可赚洋九百余万元。（四）适当的精减了人员，规定了人员待遇，并决定今后用人要做到“因事设人”。过去工资待遇规定以货币作标准，这次一律改为以实物作标准。并规定分红时要从红利中抽取一部，按成绩好坏给予奖励。
