Xinhua News Agency, North China, 25th: The People's Liberation Army, commanded by Generals Yang Dezhi, Luo Ruiqing, Yang Chengwu, and Li Jingquan, launched an autumn offensive in September with the goal of occupying the Ping-Sui Railway and annihilating the bandit troops of Fu Zuoyi. Within one month, they annihilated and captured over 10,000 of Fu's troops, destroyed multiple sections of the Ping-Zhang line, and captured Guyuan, Chongli, Shangdu, and Shangyi in northern Chahar; Zhuolu in southern Chahar; Jining, Fengzhen, Xinghe, and Taolin in eastern Suiyuan; Liangcheng, Helin, Qingshuihe, and Tuoketuo in southern Suiyuan; and Wuchuan, Sarachi, and Baotou in western Suiyuan. From Zhangjiakou to Baotou, except for Datong and Guisui, all areas are now under our control. The enemy troops defending Baotou, including the newly formed 11th Brigade that retreated from Yulin, are fleeing westward in fear of annihilation, and we are currently pursuing them. The capture of the commercial hub of Baotou is of great significance for the liberation of the entire Suiyuan. Fu Zuoyi's main forces are now concentrated in the Ping-Zhang section. Fu Zuoyi himself is in Beiping daily, discussing with the bandit Chiang Kai-shek how to salvage the desperate situation, but all his efforts are in vain.

Xinhua News Agency, Sui-Mongolian Front, 25th: The Liberation Army on the Sui-Mongolian front, in its advance towards Fu Zuoyi's rear, successively liberated four county seats from the 19th to the 23rd: Tuoxian (Tuoketuo) City, Wuchuan City north of Guisui, Sa County (Sarachi) City on the Ping-Sui line west of Guisui, and Baotou City. Within Suiyuan, the Ping-Sui Railway and the Daqingshan area are now entirely under the control of the Liberation Army, with the exception of the isolated city of Guisui.

　　平绥前线我军秋季攻势一个月
  　歼敌万余克城十六座
  　武川萨县均告解放归绥成孤岛
    【新华社华北二十五日电】杨德志、罗瑞卿、杨成武、李井泉诸将军指挥的人民解放军，以占领平绥路歼灭傅作义匪军为目标的秋季作战，开始于九月间。一个月内，歼灭和俘虏傅部一万余人，破毁平张段多处，攻占察北之沽源、崇礼、商都、尚义，察南之涿鹿，绥东之集宁、丰镇、兴和、陶林，绥南之凉城、和林、清水河、托克托，绥西之武川、萨拉齐、包头等处。由张家口至包头除大同、归绥两点外，全部为我占领。包头守敌为由榆林撤退之新十一旅等部，惧歼西窜，我正追剿中。包头商业重镇为我所占领，对于整个绥远的解放，意义甚大。傅匪作义的主力现集中于平张段，傅匪本人，每日与现在北平之蒋匪介石筹议如何挽救危局的方法，徒见其心劳日拙而已。
    【新华社绥蒙前线二十五日电】绥蒙前线解放军，在向傅作义后方的进军中，于十九日至二十三日，先后解放县城四座，即托县（托克托）城、归绥以北的武川城、归绥以西平绥线上的萨县（萨拉齐）城和包头城。绥远境内的平绥铁路及大青山地区，除归绥孤城外，已全部为解放军所控制。
