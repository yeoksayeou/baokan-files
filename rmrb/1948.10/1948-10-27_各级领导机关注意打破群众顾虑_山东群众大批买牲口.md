Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th. Shandong farmers in several areas are purchasing draft animals and livestock in large quantities to solve the problem of insufficient animal power during autumn plowing and sowing. According to extremely incomplete statistics, more than 10,000 head of livestock have been purchased in six counties, including Ju County and Mengshan, in the Luzhongnan District before the autumn harvest. The Xihai sub-district of Jiaodong has also successively purchased more than 8,000 head. Many villages in Bohai and Luzhongnan have increased their purchases by one-third to one-fold. Due to the enemy's looting and slaughter during last year's "key offensives," the livestock power in most rural areas of Shandong suffered heavy losses. At the same time, due to certain deviations in the implementation of policies in some areas during land reform, and the failure to reasonably resolve issues such as cattle fodder and the substitution of human labor for cattle labor in mutual aid groups, the masses were unwilling to buy and raise cattle. Coupled with the masses' ideological concerns about being struggled against after becoming rich through production, the livestock power decreased day by day, creating great difficulties in developing production. Before the autumn plowing and sowing, the leading organs at all levels in Shandong paid attention to this issue, first of all, putting forward the idea of breaking down the masses' concerns about production and establishing the idea of getting rich through labor. In Jiaodong District, the land policy and production policy were repeatedly publicized to the masses in a more general way. In Liujiayingzi Village, Beimeng District, Changyi South County, when publicizing the policy, the livestock of Sun Yuqing, a middle peasant who had been wrongly struggled against last year, was returned, which influenced the villagers to buy seven head of livestock after the wheat harvest. Three middle-peasant families in Chizi Village in the district sold their cattle to the outside world before the autumn harvest for fear of people borrowing livestock. After the cadres explained the policy, two families repurchased livestock. The villagers also followed suit and bought a total of 96 head of livestock. During the summer hoeing, the Ju (County) South County Party Committee of Luzhongnan District focused on explaining to the masses that the land in Junan County had basically reached equal distribution, and that the main focus in the future would be on developing production; getting rich through production mainly depends on organizing cooperative mutual assistance, improving agricultural technology, and purchasing livestock and farm implements. At the same time, the county party committee conducted education among village cadres and activists of the branch. Therefore, Lingnan District of the county added a total of 154 head of cattle and donkeys. Secondly, it is proposed to protect livestock and reasonably replace cattle labor with human labor. After Wei (County) North County's Huatuan District emphasized the publicity of issues such as equivalent exchange, cattle labor points, and no forced borrowing, the masses' concerns were dispelled, and the country added 267 head of livestock. Before the autumn harvest, Wulian County (newly established county, south of Zhucheng) conscientiously solved the problem of cattle fodder, stipulating that one dou of bran would be given for plowing one big mu (equivalent to three mu) a day, and proposed to love livestock and encourage everyone to buy cattle.

　　各级领导机关注意打破群众顾虑
  　山东群众大批买牲口
    【新华社华东二十五日电】山东若干地区农民大批购买耕牛牲口，解决秋耕秋种中畜力的困难。据极不完全统计，鲁中南区的莒县、蒙山等六个县于秋收前已添购牲口万余头，胶东的西海分区亦相继买进八千余头，渤海及鲁中南不少乡村增购三分之一至一倍。山东大部农村畜力，由于去年敌人“重点进攻”时的抢掠屠宰，损失甚巨。同时，由于土地改革中若干地区在执行政策时有某些偏向及变工互助中未合理解决牛草、人工顶牛工等问题，群众多不愿买牛、养牛，加上群众思想上存在怕生产发家后挨斗的顾虑，致畜力日形减少，造成发展生产中的极大困难。山东各级领导机关在秋耕秋种前注意了这个问题，首先提出打破群众对生产的顾虑，树立劳动发家思想。胶东区各地较普遍地反复向群众宣传了土地政策与生产政策。昌（邑）南县北孟区刘家营子村在宣传政策时，发还去年错斗的中农孙渔清的牲口，因而影响该村群众在麦收后便买进了七头牲口。该区池子村有三家中农在秋收前因怕人借牲畜，向外卖牛，后经干部解释政策，有两家便重新买了牲口。全村群众也就跟着共添买了九十六头牲口。鲁中南区莒（县）南县县委在夏锄时，着重向群众说明莒南县土地已大体达到平分，今后主要是发展生产；生产发家主要靠组织合作互助，改良农业技术，添买牲口、农具。该县委同时在村干、支部积极分子中进行了教育。因此该县岭南区添买了耕牛、驴子共一百五十四头。其次是提出保护牲畜，合理地以人工顶牛工。潍（县）北县华疃区在强调宣传等价交换、牛工计分、不准强借等问题后，群众顾虑打消，全国添买牲口二百六十七头。五莲县（新设县，诸城南部）在秋收前即认真解决牛草，规定一天耕一大亩（合三亩）给一斗秣秣，并提出爱护畜力鼓励大家买牛。
