Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. TASS dispatch: The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union sent a telegram to the General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour, Frachon, and Le Leap, on the 14th, which stated: On behalf of millions of members of the Soviet trade unions, we extend warm fraternal greetings to the delegates of the 27th National Congress of the French General Confederation of Labour, and wish the Congress success in its future activities in defending the social and economic rights of the working people, the international and domestic solidarity of the working class, and in opposing the instigators of new wars and maintaining lasting peace and democracy. Deep regret is expressed that the Soviet delegation was unable to attend the Congress at the invitation due to the French government's refusal to issue entry visas. Despite the attempts of the French reactionaries to obstruct the friendship and unity between the trade unions of the Soviet Union and France, it is firmly believed that the fraternal cooperation between the working people of France and the Soviet Union will be further strengthened and developed, which will benefit the international workers' movement and the common struggle to maintain friendship between countries and strive for stable and lasting peace.

　　苏联职工会中央委员会
  　电贺法总工会大会
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联职工会中央委员会主席团十四日致法国总工会总书记佛拉商及勒里甫贺电略称：谨代表苏联职工会千百万会员向法国总工会第二十七届全国代表大会代表们致热烈的兄弟敬礼，并祝大会今后在保卫劳动人民社会经济权利和工人阶级国际国内团结，及反对新战争挑拨者而维护持久和平与民主的活动中获得成功。对苏联代表团因法国政府拒绝发给入境护照而不能应邀参加大会，深表遗憾。尽管法国反动派企图阻挠苏法两国职工会间友谊的团结，坚信法苏两国劳动人民的兄弟般合作将更为加强与发展，以利于国际工人阶级运动和维护各国友谊以争取安定持久和平的共同斗争。
