　　[Taiyue Telegraph] In Taiyue, eight counties including Tunliu, Changzi, Qinyuan, Gaoping, Jincheng, Yangcheng, Qinshui, and Yicheng, have successively launched autumn cultivation since the end of September under the slogan of "harvesting while cultivating". Among them, Qinshui started the earliest, with most villages starting to cultivate the land on September 26th. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8,000 mu have been cultivated. Tunliu also started on October 2nd, and other counties have started one after another. The development of autumn cultivation in these areas, in addition to the masses accepting the experience of the benefits of autumn cultivation last year, is primarily due to the attention paid by governments at all levels of the Administrative Office, Special District, and County. The Administrative Office clearly pointed out to governments at all levels that autumn cultivation is the foundation for next year's great production. They also organized harvesting while cultivating to achieve a universal plowing of autumn land. When autumn harvesting and planting were nearing completion, an instruction was issued again on the 11th, once again calling for strengthening leadership over autumn cultivation. Around the 10th, districts in Tunliu, Changzi, and other counties convened meetings of party branch members and cadres to mobilize for autumn cultivation. The Second District specifically discussed leadership methods, how to avoid both coercion and laissez-faire. Tunliu, in particular, sent cadres to specifically organize inspections of autumn cultivation, promptly discovering and correcting deviations. For example, after Jincheng discovered the phenomenon of villages neglecting autumn cultivation due to engaging in burdens, it immediately and quickly corrected it. Village cadres in Nanshoucheng, Yicheng, were lax in leading autumn cultivation, and a meeting was held on the 15th to review and determine improvement measures. Village cadres in Chen Village, Gaoping's Third District, were divided into various hamlets to provide specific leadership, and a reporting and inspection system was established. Generally speaking, autumn cultivation is not yet widespread, mainly because leadership in a few counties still consists of general instructions rather than specific work, so leadership must be strengthened. Secondly, all localities have paid attention to breaking down obstacles and difficulties in autumn cultivation. First, continue to extensively publicize that the land reform in our area has been completed, in order to further stabilize people's hearts. Some places persuaded the masses to stop transportation and first engage in autumn cultivation. Furthermore, continue to resolve the thinking of district and village cadres who are afraid of making mistakes and do not dare to lead autumn cultivation. For example, coercion and commandism by district and village cadres in Yuebei's autumn cultivation last year was very serious, and they were criticized. Therefore, some cadres mistakenly believe that last year's autumn cultivation work was also wrong. Coupled with the fear of offending people and the fear of rectifying the Party, they are even more hesitant. The leadership clearly pointed out that autumn cultivation is the demand of the masses, but the style of coercion and commandism must be overcome. This enables everyone to distinguish right from wrong, draw a clear line between right and wrong, and actively rise up to lead the autumn cultivation movement.

　　抓紧领导打破障碍太岳先后展开秋耕
    【太岳电】太岳屯留、长子、沁源、高平、晋城、阳城、沁水、翼城八县，在边收边耕口号下，从九月底先后展开秋耕，其中以沁水开始的最早，在九月二十六日已有大部村庄开始耕地，据不完全统计，已耕八千来亩。屯留亦于十月二日开始，其他各县已先后开始。这些地方秋耕的开展，除群众接受了去年秋耕好处的经验外，首先是行署、专、县各级政府的重视，行署很早即给各级政府明确指出秋耕是明年大生产的基础。并要组织边收边耕，以达到秋地普耕一遍。当秋收秋种接近完成时，又于十一日发出指示，再一次号召加强对秋耕的领导。屯留、长子等县各区，在十日前后召集支部党员干部大会，进行秋耕动员。二区特别讨论了领导方法，如何既不强迫命令也不放任自流。尤其是屯留，还派出干部专门组织检查秋耕。及时发现纠正偏向。如晋城发现各村因搞负担忽视秋耕的现象后，立即迅速纠正。翼城南寿城村干对领导秋耕松懈，十五日即开会检讨定出改进办法。高平三区陈村干部分到各闾具体领导，并建立汇报检查制度。总的来看秋耕还不普遍。主要因为在少数县的领导上还是一般指示多具体工作少，因此必须加强领导。其次，各地在秋耕中注意了打破障碍与困难。首先继续大量宣传我区土改业已完成，以进一步安定人心。有些地方说服群众停止运输先搞秋耕。再就是继续解决区村干部怕犯错误不敢领导秋耕的思想。如岳北去年秋耕区村干部强迫命令非常严重，曾经受到批评，因此有些干部误认为去年的秋耕工作也错了，加上怕惹人怕整党的思想，更是束手束脚。领导上明确指出秋耕是群众的要求，但强迫命令的作风必须克服。使大家分清是非划清正确错误的界限，积极的起来领导秋耕运动。
