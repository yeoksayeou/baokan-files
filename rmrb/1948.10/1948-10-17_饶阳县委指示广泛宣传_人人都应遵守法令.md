　　The Raoyang County Party Committee issued instructions to widely publicize that everyone should abide by laws and decrees.

　　[Jizhong Electric] In some villages in Raoyang, the phenomena of anarchism and extreme democratization are serious, hindering the progress of production, supporting the front, and other tasks in rural areas. Illegal acts that violate government laws and decrees, gambling, theft, and even sabotage of production occur constantly in some villages. In Wan’ai Village, District 10, an individual dug up trees on the river embankment. When a county cadre stopped him, he said, "I'm poor. What if I dig?" The county cadre said that digging up trees on the river embankment was illegal and asked him to go to the government. He said, "Why are you using coercion? I won't go." Later, when he was insisted on going, he said, "I'm not in the organization (referring to not being a Communist Party member). What can you do to me if I go!" In Tuanli Village, District 6, an individual was called to the district office for gambling, but he said to the district head, "I am a poor peasant, and I am a family member of a revolutionary soldier. Playing with money is for fun. What are you interfering with?" In Menggang, District 3, hooligans beat the village security officer; in Luhancun, District 7, bad elements openly beat the head of a section of the County Public Security Bureau. When Nan Zhangbao in District 3 and Tuanli in District 6 organized militia companies to support the front, whoever was assigned refused to go, and as a result, no one went. In addition, there are many illegal phenomena such as not providing war service, not doing substitute farming, and not paying public grain. During the autumn harvest, theft and burning of crops by bad elements were discovered. For example, the eleven mu of grain of Gao Kai, a poor peasant representative in Gaoqiao Village, District 4, was burned in the field by saboteurs. The two mu of grain of Liu Shuyun, a female representative of Wang Liuzhi Bridge Village, were also burned by bad elements, and more than eight mu of cabbage of the village cadres and poor peasants were also cut down. In Fanlou, Licun, and more than ten other villages, there were also incidents of crops being stolen or burned. Most of those whose crops were burned or stolen were village cadres, veterans, and poor peasants. The people who steal crops are: one type is the reactionary retaliatory behavior of landlords and old rich peasants reactionary elements; another type is that some hooligans are used by others to sabotage farmers' production; and another type is individual people who were poor in the past but now have land, but do not actively engage in production and have a habit of stealing, mistakenly believing that stealing a little something is not illegal. The reasons for the above-mentioned phenomena of anarchism and extreme democracy are: mainly that most cadres were transferred after the land reform, and there were more new cadres, who have insufficient experience and poor ability to solve problems; both new and old cadres in the villages have ideological concerns, their emotions have not fully recovered, giving bad elements an opportunity to take advantage of. In addition, some county and district cadres have tailism and the idea of ​​solely relying on composition, mistakenly believing that poor peasants who commit crimes should not be dealt with according to law. The failure to deal with anarchist phenomena in a timely manner, coupled with individual runaway soldiers, degenerate cadres, and hooligans, has formed a backward layer in rural areas, playing a certain destructive role in various tasks. In order to correct the above-mentioned anarchist phenomena, the county party committee issued instructions calling on all localities to carry out propaganda campaigns against extreme democratization, explaining that the people in the liberated areas should obey the leadership of the democratic government and abide by the laws and decrees of the democratic government. Government laws and decrees must be observed by all classes. Whoever violates the law must be punished. Laws and decrees are to protect good people and punish bad people, not to coerce. Therefore, all the people must ensure the implementation of democratic laws and decrees. Failure to perform war service, failure to pay public grain, theft, gambling, and even beating and scolding district and village cadres are all illegal acts. All districts and villages should use various propaganda tools to expand publicity to the masses, convene symposiums when necessary to conduct education, and solicit opinions from the masses on overcoming the state of anarchy, and educate the masses through the masses. Finally, it was proposed that old cadres in various districts and villages should help new cadres study laws and decrees, and those lawbreakers who have been discovered should be dealt with appropriately according to the seriousness of the circumstances, and the handling process should be brought to the masses for discussion to educate the masses with facts.

### 饶阳县委指示广泛宣传　人人都应遵守法令

　　饶阳县委指示广泛宣传
  　人人都应遵守法令
    【冀中电】饶阳部分村庄无政府、极端民主化现象严重，障碍着农村中生产、支前等工作的进行，有些村庄不断发生违犯政府法令、赌博、偷盗甚至破坏生产的非法行为。十区万艾村一个人刨河堤上的树，县干部制止他，他说：“我穷，不刨怎么着？”县干部说他刨河堤上的树是犯法，叫他跟着到政府去，他说：“你为什么强迫命令？我就不去。”后来坚决让他去，他说：“我又不在组织（指不是共产党员），去了你还能把我怎么着！”六区团里村一个人因赌博被叫到区公所，他却向区长说：“我是贫农，我是抗属，玩钱是为了开心，你管我干什么。”三区孟岗流氓分子打了村治安员；七区吕汉村坏分子公然打了县公安局一股股长。三区南张保、六区团里组织民兵连支前时，派谁谁不去，结果竟未去成。此外不出战勤、不代耕、不交公粮等违法现象也很多。秋收中，曾发现坏分子偷盗和烧毁庄稼。如四区高桥村贫农代表高楷的十一亩谷子，在场里被破坏分子烧了，王刘枝桥村女代表刘淑云的二亩谷，也被坏分子烧毁，该村干部和贫农的八亩多白菜也被砍毁；范楼、李村等十余村，也发生庄稼被偷盗或烧毁的事情；被烧或被偷的大部分是村干部、荣军和贫农的。偷庄稼的人，一种是地主、旧富农反动分子的反动报复行为；一种是一些流氓分子被人利用，破坏农民生产；一种则是个别的过去贫苦现在有了地，但不积极生产，有偷盗习惯的人，误认为偷点东西不算犯法。发生以上无政府、极端民主现象的原因：主要是土改后大部干部调动，新干部增多，经验不足，解决问题能力较差；村中新老干部都有思想顾虑，情绪未完全恢复，给了坏分子钻空机会。另外是某些县区干部存在着尾巴主义和唯成份论思想，错误的认为贫农犯法不应依法处理。对无政府现象未及时处理，再加上个别逃亡战士、蜕化干部及流氓二流子，形成了农村的落后层，在各种工作上起着一定的破坏作用。为纠正上述无政府现象，该县县委特发出指示，号召各地开展反极端民主化的宣传运动，说明解放区人民应服从民主政府领导，遵守民主政府法令。政府法令任何阶层都得遵守，谁犯法谁要受处分，法令是保护好人制裁坏人的，不是强迫命令。因此全体人民要保证民主法令贯彻执行。不执行战争勤务、不交公粮、偷盗、赌博甚至打骂区村干部，都是犯法行为。各区村要利用各种宣传工具向群众扩大宣传，必要时召集座谈会进行教育，并向群众征求克服无政府状态的意见，通过群众教育群众。最后提出：各区村老干部要帮助新干部研究法令，对现在已发现的违法分子，应分别情节轻重，予以适当处理，并将处理经过拿到群众中去讨论，以事实教育群众。
