Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th: The Jin-Sui Liberated Area is universally celebrating a bumper harvest this year. Most areas have yields unseen in over a decade, with dry land producing over one large shi (石) of coarse grains per mu (亩) (compared to the usual five, six, seven, or eight dou (斗) in normal years). This year's harvests in various regions have exceeded the normal yields set during land reform. Most counties are experiencing harvests of at least 80% above normal. Only some areas in individual counties like Shenmu, Fugou, and Xingxian have slightly poorer autumn harvests, but even these are better than in previous years, and their summer harvests were bountiful. In counties like Lishi and Jingle, sorghum stalks are taller than two people, and millet is as tall as one person, with thick ears and full grains. All kinds of crops have yielded bountifully. Farmers in Lishi are very happy, calling it "all four grains (referring to barley, wheat, oats, and buckwheat) harvested." The potatoes, which are produced in large quantities in this area, are also especially large. The expected early frost has not yet arrived, and the autumn fields have not suffered any damage. Currently, people are harvesting and plowing simultaneously, tilling the land in large quantities until the ground freezes after the beginning of winter in mid-November. It is expected that one-third to one-half of the planned autumn plowing can be completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: Heilongjiang Province, the "North Manchurian Granary," has achieved a rare bumper harvest this autumn, exceeding the production plan to increase grain by one million shi. Taking Suihua and Hailun, the province's largest grain-producing counties, as examples, the average yield per qing (顷) (ten mu) is no less than six shi. The province has a total cultivated area of 1.8 million qing. After deducting 325,000 qing of wheat fields and 75,000 qing affected by water, insect, and hail disasters, there remain 1.4 million qing. Assuming an average yield of 5.4 dou per qing, the harvest can reach 7.56 million shi. In addition, although wheat suffered from reduced harvest due to diseases, it can still yield more than 200,000 shi. Last year, the province's total output, including wheat, did not exceed 6.5 million shi. The autumn harvest campaign in the province's sixteen counties began in mid-September and was basically completed by the 20th.

　　晋绥普庆丰收
  　黑龙江超过增产粮食计划
    【新华社晋绥十九日电】晋绥解放区今年普庆丰收。绝大部分地区收成为十余年来所未有，平地每亩产粗粮一大石以上（一般年成仅产五六斗或七八斗）。各地今年收成都超过土地改革中所定的常年产量。多数县分是十成年景。全边区平均至少也有八成，仅神木、府谷、兴县等个别县分的部分地区秋田稍差，但也比前几年好，而且夏田丰收。离石、静乐等县高梁杆比两人还高，糜谷也有一人高，穗子粗大，穗粒饱满。各种作物都丰收，离石农民称为“四麦（即大麦、小麦、莜麦、荞麦）皆收”，非常高兴。本区大量出产的马铃薯也特别肥大。今年预期的早冻尚未到来，秋田未受损失。目前各地正收一块耕一块，大量翻地，直到十一月中旬立冬后大地封冻为止，预期可完成秋耕三分之一至二分之一耕地的计划。
    【新华社东北二十四日电】“北满谷仓”的黑龙江省，今秋获得历年少有的丰收，超过了增产粮食百万石的生产计划。以该省最大产粮县绥化、海伦为例，每垧（十亩）平均产额不下六石。该省耕地面积共一百八十万垧，除去三十二万五千垧麦地及七万五千垧受水、虫、雹灾害地为一百四十万垧，以每垧平均产五石四斗计，可收获七百五十六万石。此外，小麦虽因病疸歉收仍可收到二十万石以上。而去年全省连麦子在内总产量则不超过六百五十万石。该省十六县秋收运动于九月中旬开始，迄二十日止已基本完成。
