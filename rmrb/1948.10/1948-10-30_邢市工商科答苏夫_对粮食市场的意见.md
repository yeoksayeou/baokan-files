To the Editor: After reading Su Fu's opinions on the grain market in our city in the People's Daily, we immediately conducted an inspection. The results of the inspection are as follows:

In our market management, in order to regulate supply and demand, stabilize grain prices, facilitate mass transactions, and complete certain autumn harvest tasks, we previously stipulated that all grain traded in the market, even if not through a broker, would be subject to a handling fee. Transactions outside the market would not be subject to this fee. After the Border Region Government's order was issued, we did not promptly correct this practice, fearing it would affect fiscal revenue. We held a one-sided fiscal viewpoint. After inspection, we criticized this viewpoint and corrected it. Although we have been reforming the grain market for several years, some abnormal phenomena still exist. For example, although weights and measures have long been standardized, some still use old measures and scales to deceive the masses. Also, when grain prices rise, some local merchants in our city intercept grain halfway, taking advantage of the farmers' lack of market knowledge, causing them to suffer losses. Some grain merchants even deliberately fluctuate grain prices in the market, buying up large quantities of a particular grain when the supply is low and then selling it at high prices. Based on these situations, we will, in the future, in addition to strengthening the role of state-owned grain stores in regulating grain and stabilizing prices, also stipulate that the use of old measures and scales for grain transactions is prohibited. Local merchants in our city are not allowed to intercept grain halfway; they must go to the designated market for free transactions. Transactions through brokers will be subject to a 2% handling fee based on the price. In the past, it was also 2%, not 250 yuan per dou. After collecting the transaction fee, the government will issue receipts. This is still necessary, otherwise, there might be arbitrary charges.

### 邢市工商科答苏夫　对粮食市场的意见

　　邢市工商科答苏夫
  　对粮食市场的意见
    编辑同志：我们看到人民日报苏夫对于本市粮食市提出的意见之后，立即进行了检查，兹将检查情形答复如下：
    我们在市场管理上，为了调剂供需，稳定粮价，便利群众交易，并为了完成一定的秋收任务，因此过去规定凡在市场交易的粮食，即不经交易员成交，亦照抽手续费，在市场以外成交者不抽，这种规定在边府命令颁布后，曾因怕影响财政收入，未及时改正，我们是存有片面的财政观点的，经过检查，我们批判了这种观点，并作了纠正。我们对粮食市场的管理上，虽经过几年的改造，但仍然存在着若干不正常的现象。如度量衡早已统一，但有的仍使用旧斗旧秤，欺骗群众；还有在粮价上涨时，本市商贩趁农民不明行市半路截买，使农民吃亏，甚至有粮商在市场故意波动粮价，见某一种粮食上市少，即大量收买，即时高价出售，根据这些情况，我们今后在市场管理上，除加强公营粮店调剂粮食，稳定粮价的作用外，并规定不准使用旧斗旧秤买卖粮食。本市商贩不准在半路截粮，必须到指定市场自由成交，经交易员成交的按价抽百分之二的手续费。过去也是按百分之二抽的，不是每斗二百五十元，征交易费后政府发给收据，还是必需的，如果没有，恐怕形成乱收。
