All clothing factories and the vast number of women in the rear area have worked selflessly, even staying up all night, to complete ×0,000 sets of cotton-padded clothes ahead of schedule, so that the People's Liberation Army can wear brand new winter uniforms when fighting on the Sui-Meng Plateau, which is 2,000 meters above sea level and has already seen frost.
