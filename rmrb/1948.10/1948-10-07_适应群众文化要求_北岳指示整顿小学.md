　　Adapting to the Cultural Demands of the Masses
    Northern Yue Directs Rectification of Primary Schools
    [Northern Yue Dispatch] For more than a year, primary school education in the Northern Yue area has been weakened in leadership due to the merger of the civil education and judicial departments. Due to biases in the land reform, the transformation and cultivation of intellectuals have been neglected, and the reduction of primary school teachers' salaries has also affected their morale. Furthermore, primary schools themselves have serious shortcomings: too many social activities and too little cultural education, and teachers of too low quality, so that they cannot meet the needs of the masses or gain their attention. Many primary schools have become nominal or have stagnated. Although there has been some recovery since this spring, most have not been well-run. The only primary schools that have developed are in individual areas. In order to adapt to the cultural demands of the masses, the Northern Yue Administrative Office has issued instructions to vigorously rectify and restore primary school education. The instructions state in brief:
    (1) Primary schools that have not yet closed or have already been restored must strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses and teachers in each village to run schools seriously, strengthen cultural education, reduce other activities, establish regular teaching systems, and complete education plans on schedule. Primary schools (including both higher and lower primary schools) that have closed in old and semi-old areas must be fully restored in a planned and step-by-step manner. In newly recovered areas, after teachers have been given some training and supplemented, schools should be reopened according to the original scale. It is required that each administrative village with more than fifty households in the old areas generally have a primary school. Small mountain villages with more than fifty households must also take measures such as jointly establishing itinerant half-day or evening schools to give the children of the masses the opportunity to receive education, depending on the situation. (2) Teachers are the central key to the quality of primary school education. Therefore, existing teachers must be improved in quality, and vacancies must be filled. Each county must make full use of the autumn holiday period to adjust, supplement, and train teachers. Existing teachers whose cultural level is too low to be competent should be helped to improve or transferred to other appropriate jobs. Primary school teachers who were purged and suspended during the land reform should be reinstated, except for genuine counter-revolutionaries, and intellectuals in the villages should be boldly promoted. The government should try its best to recruit intellectuals who are willing to serve the people and have a certain cultural level, give them short-term training, and supplement the teaching staff. Teachers' salaries should also be appropriately increased. (3) Whether rectifying or restoring, it is necessary to be realistic and seek truth from facts and to give full play to democratic working methods. Through cadre meetings, mass meetings, parent-teacher conferences, family visits, and individual interviews, methods such as persuasion, explanation, and encouragement should be used to mobilize the masses to run schools voluntarily and send their children to school. Children's enrollment is completely free. No family component shall be subject to restrictions or discrimination. Schools may set up half-day and evening classes to take care of children who are particularly busy with family affairs and production. (4) Strengthen leadership and improve administrative institutions. Each special county should immediately implement the separation of civil education and equip cadres with a certain working ability and cultural level who can be competent for this work. Establish and improve working systems, establish normal supervision and inspection work, regularly help teachers study their profession and improve teaching methods, gradually improve teachers' political and cultural level, and pay attention to maintaining the stability of primary school teachers' work and not arbitrarily transferring them.

　　适应群众文化要求
    北岳指示整顿小学
    【北岳电】北岳区小学教育，一年多以来，由于民教司法部门的合并，削弱了小学教育的领导。由于土地改革中的偏向，忽视了知识分子的改造与培养，又因小学教员待遇的降低，也影响了小学教员服务的情绪。更加小学本身存在着严重的缺点，社会活动太多，文化教育太少，教员质量太低，以致不能满足群众的要求，不能引起群众的重视，许多小学形成有名无实，或停顿状态。今年春后虽有些恢复，但大多数仍未办好。小学有发展的，只是个别地区。北岳行署为适应群众文化要求，特发出指示，大力整顿恢复小学教育。指示略称：
    （一）尚未停顿或者已经恢复的小学，必须加强领导，动员各村群众与教师认真办学，加强文化教育，减少其他活动，建立正规的教学制度，按期完成教育计划。老区半老区已经停顿之小学（包括高初两级小学），必须有计划有步骤的全部予以恢复。新收复区，对于原有的小学，将教员进行一定训练补充后，应即按照原有规模开学。要求老区各县五十户以上之行政村，一般要有一个小学。五十户以上的山沟小村，亦须按照情况，采取联立巡回半日午夜校等办法，给群众子女以受教育的机会。（二）小学教育的好坏，教员是中心关键，因之现有教员在质量上必须提高，缺额必须设法补充。各县要充分利用秋假期间调整补充及训练教师。现有教员中文化水平太低，不能胜任者，应设法提高或转向其他适当工作。在土改期间洗刷停职的小学教师，除真正反革命分子外，一律复职，并大胆提拔在乡知识分子。凡愿为人民服务，具有一定文化水准的知识分子，政府都应尽量收罗，给以短期训练，补充师资。在教员待遇上，亦适当予以提高。（三）无论整顿与恢复，必须实事求是，充分发挥民主的工作方法。通过干部会、群众会、家长座谈会、家庭访问、个别访问等形式，以劝导解释鼓励等方法，动员群众自动办学及送子女入学。儿童入学完全自由。任何家庭成份均不得加以限制与歧视。对家庭事务及生产特忙的儿童，学校得附设半日及午夜等班，予以照顾。（四）加强领导，健全行政机构，各专县立即实行民教分设，配备具有一定工作能力、文化水平、能够胜任的干部，担任这一工作。建立与健全工作制度，建立正常的督导巡视工作，经常帮助教员研究业务，改进教导方法，逐步提高教员的政治文化水平，并切实注意保持小学教员工作稳定，不得随意调动。
