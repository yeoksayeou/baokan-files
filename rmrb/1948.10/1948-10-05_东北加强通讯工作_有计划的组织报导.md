Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st: After the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued the "Decision on Launching the Northeast Daily Communication Work" on "September 1st," various localities have begun to arrange for further strengthening communication work and organizing reporting in a planned way to implement the principle of "the whole party running the newspaper." The Propaganda Department of the Songjiang Provincial Party Committee made a serious self-criticism and review of its past laissez-faire attitude toward the party newspaper's communication work, and resolved to correct the above-mentioned phenomenon throughout the province; at the same time, it decided to establish a regular communication work research meeting system in the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department in the future, striving to provide the party newspaper with a province-wide comprehensive report every twenty days to one month, and designated special personnel as special correspondents for each county, city, and provincial-level unit, responsible for leading and promoting the communication work of each unit. The Liaobei Provincial Party Committee also recently announced a list of fifty people designated as special correspondents for the Northeast Daily, and instructed each person to write at least one manuscript per month. The Heilongjiang Provincial Propaganda Department has decided to establish and improve communication work in conjunction with party building. The Party Committee of the Northeast Railway Administration issued notices to the Qiqihar, Harbin, and Jilin Administrations on the 15th, instructing the Party Committees of each Administration to directly designate communication officers to strengthen communication work; all manuscripts involving the party's policies and propositions or with important principles must be personally reviewed by the Party Committees of each Administration, and the specific facts must be investigated clearly, and sent to the Party Committee of the General Administration for review and issuance along with the original manuscript. In addition, departments such as the Northeast No. 1 Coal Mine Area, the Andong Provincial Public Enterprise Administration, the Liaodong Ordnance Department, and the Daowai Branch of the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions have also established and improved communication organizations in accordance with the instructions of the Northeast Bureau, strengthening communication and reporting work.

　　东北加强通讯工作  有计划的组织报导
    【新华社东北一日电】中共中央东北局于“九一”发出“关于开展东北日报通讯工作的决定”后，各地已纷纷着手布置进一步加强通讯工作及有计划的组织报导，以贯彻“全党办报”的方针。松江省委宣传部对于过去对党报通讯工作采取放任自流的态度，曾作严肃的自我批评及检讨，并决心在全省范围内纠正上述现象；同时决定今后省委宣传部建立定期研究通讯工作的会议制度，争取做到每二十天至一个月供给党报一篇全省性的综合报导，并指定专人为各县、市及省委直属单位的特约通讯员，负责领导推动各单位通讯工作。辽北省委亦于最近公布被指定为东北日报特约通讯员的五十个人的名单，责成每人每月至少写稿一篇。黑龙江省宣传部已决定结合建党，建立并改善通讯工作。东北铁路总局党委会于十五日分别向齐齐哈尔、哈尔滨、吉林三管理局发出通知，责成各该局党委直接负责指定通讯干事，加强通讯工作；凡涉及党的政策主张或带有重要原则性稿件，各管理局党委会必须亲自审阅，并将具体事实调查清楚，连同原稿送总局党委会审阅发出。此外，如东北第一煤矿区、安东省公营企业管理局、辽东兵工部、哈尔滨职工总会道外分会等矿山、企业、工会诸部门，也都遵照东北局指示，分别建立和健全通讯组织，加强通讯报导工作。
