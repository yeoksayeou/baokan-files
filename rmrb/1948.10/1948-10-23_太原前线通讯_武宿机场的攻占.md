　　Taiyuan Frontline Dispatch
  　The Capture of Wusu Airport

    Wusu South Airport, upon which the Yan bandit clique holed up on the isolated island of Taiyuan relied for aerial resupply, has been completely captured by our army. Wusu Airport is located more than twenty li from the city, between Wusu, Malianying, Xinying, and Gaozhongcun. It was built in cooperation with the American imperialist Chennault Aviation, and is one of the five major airports in the country. The airport is surrounded by a circular railway and a cement highway leading directly to Taiyuan. Inside the field are three runways, with a diameter of seven or eight li, capable of landing giant airborne fortresses. The Yan bandit clique used this to export light and heavy industrial products such as copper, iron, cement, and cloth, in exchange for food and ammunition assistance from the American-Chiang alliance. After our army advanced victoriously into the suburbs of Taiyuan during the Jinzhong Campaign, it controlled the airport with firepower, rendering it unusable by the Yan bandit clique. The Yan bandit clique, trapped on the isolated island of Taiyuan, felt the difficulty of aerial resupply (because the North Airport could not land giant transport planes), and risked drawing out so-called mobile units such as the Provisional 44th Division, Provisional 45th Division, 73rd Division, and 72nd Division, concentrating them around Wusu, and stationing the 73rd Division at Wusu Airport, attempting to consolidate the defenses of the North and South Airports and rely on aerial resupply to fight like cornered beasts. Unexpectedly, our powerful field army, with the force of a tiger snatching at the heart, thrust into the rear of the Yan bandit defense line, completely annihilating units such as the Provisional 44th Division and Provisional 45th Division, and seized the North Barracks fortress in victory. Wusu Airport was completely surrounded by our army. The enemy 73rd Division, besieged here, was extremely panicked and could only contact Taiyuan by air. This airfield projecting forward not only failed to enhance its defensive system but became a heavy burden. On October 11th, a certain unit of our army, in coordination with the Jinzhong local armed forces, launched an attack on the South Airport from four directions. The main force captured the Wusu group of bunkers that evening, and the local armed forces, under the barrage of artillery fire, broke into the main bunker northwest of Xinying at dawn the next day. Just as the attacking point of our shock troops turned toward the southeast corner attached bunker with the artillery fire, the six or seven bunker-defending enemies of the Seventh Company of the 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division surrendered their weapons. The Yan bandits stationed in Malianying village threw out letters and laid down their arms before our army launched its attack. A certain unit of our army turned to attack the three cloverleaf group bunkers in the northwest. With the coordinated action of infantry and artillery, it first seized the cloverleaf high bunker, and then used the enemy's gun holes to set up machine guns, covering the engineers in destroying the enemy's attached bunkers; the defenders of the five group bunkers in the northwest of the airport laid down their weapons under the persuasion of newly liberated officers. The remnants of the 218th Regiment headquarters of the Yan bandits, shrinking in the core position of the airport, were in shock and panic when the heavy artillery shells of our artillery group penetrated the gun holes of the two-meter-thick core fortifications and exploded in the regimental commander's office. The enemy hurriedly abandoned the core position and fled in all directions, and most of them were captured alive by our army. By this point, the entire airport was occupied by us. The sixty boxes of artillery shells, eighty boxes of small artillery shells, and fifty boxes of bullets that the enemy had transported in while besieged became new gifts for the People's Liberation Army. The air force base jointly built by Chiang, Yan, and the American imperialists left only a dilapidated plane for the pilgrimage of people coming and going to the airport.

  　武宿机场的攻占
    困守太原孤岛的阎匪，赖以空中输血之武宿南机场，已为我军完全占领。武宿机场距城二十余里，在武宿、马连营、辛营、高中村之间，为阎匪与美帝国主义陈纳德航空公司合作所建，系全国五大机场之一。机场周围有环场铁路，及洋灰公路，直达太原。场内三条跑道，直径达七八里，可降落巨型空中堡垒。阎匪借此输出铜、铁、洋灰、布匹等轻重工业品，换取美蒋粮食、军火援助。晋中战役我军乘胜挺进太原城郊以后，即以火力控制了这一机场，使阎匪无法使用。阎匪困守太原孤岛，颇感空中接济困难（因北机场不能降落巨型运输机），不惜冒险抽调暂四十四师、暂四十五师、七十三师、七十二师等所谓机动部队，猬集武宿一带，并以七十三师驻守武宿机场，企图巩固南北机场防务，依靠空中输血，作困兽之斗。不料，我强大野战军，以猛虎掏心之势，插入阎匪防线后方，全歼暂四十四师、暂四十五师等部，乘胜夺取北营要塞，武宿机场完全陷入我大军包围之中。被围于此的敌七十三师恐慌万分，只能经由空中与太原联系，这个飞机场突出阵地，不但不能增强其防御体系，反而成了一个大包袱。十月十一日，我军某部配合晋中地方武装，从四面向南机场进击，主力当晚攻占武宿集团碉堡群，地方武装于翌日拂晓在排炮轰击下，突入辛营西北主碉。我突击队进攻箭头刚随着炮火转向东南角附碉时，守敌七十三师二一八团第七连六七个守碉敌人，就缴枪投降了。驻守马连营村中之阎匪，在我军发起攻击前，投出信件，全部放下武器。我军某部转而攻击西北面三个梅花集团碉堡，在步炮协同动作下，首以连续爆破，攻占梅花高碉，即利用敌人枪眼，架起机枪，掩护工兵摧毁了敌人的附碉；机场西北五个集团碉堡的守敌，则在新被解放的军官喊话争取下，全部放下武器。龟缩在机场核心阵地之阎匪二一八团团部残敌，正在惊骇慌乱之际，我炮兵群的重炮弹，就穿进两公尺厚的核心工事枪眼，在团长室爆炸了。敌仓惶弃离核心阵地，四散逃命，被我大部活捉。至此，机场乃全部为我占领。该敌被围时，运来之六十箱炮弹，八十箱小炮弹，五十箱子弹，成了送给解放军的新礼物。蒋阎与美帝合建的空军基地，只留下一架残破飞机，供来往机场人们的巡礼。
