    Having read your telegram of the 10th, we are sincerely grateful. Now that the People's Liberation Army is advancing victoriously, this government has been formally established. Biwu and others will naturally do their utmost to uphold the principles of the North China Provisional People's Congress, intensify production and construction, support the front lines, and unite all democratic classes and democratic party members in order to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The world is in sight, and we still hope that you will provide timely guidance to correct our shortcomings.

    The North China People's Government has been formally established. Biwu and others have been erroneously elected by the North China Provisional People's Congress. The responsibility is heavy and the strength is weak. We are deeply grateful for your telegram of encouragement. We hereby reply with a special telegram.

    Your government was established at a time when the people's revolution is approaching its final victory. It is not only a great milestone in the history of Chinese democracy, but also foreshadows the imminent birth of a new China in the world. The sound of its news makes the reactionaries tremble, and the future of the revolution is bright. This association is extremely happy and hereby sends its congratulations, and wishes all committee members good health. China Association for Promoting Democracy, Ma Xulun, September 5th
    Reply Telegram from the North China People's Government to Mr. Ma Xulun of the China Association for Promoting Democracy:
    The North China Liberation Zone has established the North China People's Government. Biwu and others have been erroneously re-elected. We are moved and inspired by your telegram of encouragement. National victory is just around the corner, and we will work together with the gentlemen of your association. We hereby reply and extend our wishes for your good health.
