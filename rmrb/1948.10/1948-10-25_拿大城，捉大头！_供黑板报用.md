　　Take the Big Cities, Capture the Big Shots!
  　For Blackboard Newspapers
    On October 22nd, the People's Liberation Army occupied Zhengzhou. Zhengzhou is the intersection of the Pinghan Railway and the Longhai Railway, with a population of 230,000, and it is also a very important place militarily. Taking this place is of great benefit to the war situation of overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and liberating all of China. In less than a month, the People's Liberation Army liberated the four big cities of Jinan, Jinzhou, Changchun, and Zhengzhou.
    In the northern section of the Pinghan Road, between Beiping and Baoding, Gucheng, Xushui, Gucheng, Xincheng, Dingxing and many stations have recently been liberated, and a large town 60 miles away from Beiping has also been captured, occupying 140 miles of railway. The enemy in Baoding and the old nest in Beiping are even more out of touch.
    In Shandong, we captured another Central Committee member of the Kuomintang, Pang Jingtang. After the liberation of Jinan, he disguised himself as a merchant and tried to run to Xuzhou, but was intercepted by the People's Liberation Army on the way. As a result, there are already five Kuomintang Central Committee members who have been captured and surrendered, and the other four are Kang Ze, Wang Yaowu, Fan Hanjie, and Zheng Dongguo.
    The militia and laborers in the Jinzhong District and 14 counties of Taihang rushed to the front line in large numbers, shouting: "Attack Taiyuan and capture Yan Xishan alive!" There are no cities that the People's Liberation Army cannot conquer, and Taiyuan will surely fall into our hands!

　　拿大城，捉大头！
  　供黑板报用
    十月廿二号，人民解放军占领了郑州。郑州是平汉铁路、陇海铁路交叉的地点，有廿三万人口，在军事上又是很重要的地方。拿下这个地方，对于打倒蒋介石匪帮解放全中国的战争局面有很大好处。不到一个月，人民解放军就解放了济南、锦州、长春、郑州这四个大城。
    在平汉路北边这一段，北平到保定中间近来又解放了固安、徐水、固城、新城、定兴和许多车站，还打下离北平六十里的一个大镇，占了铁路一百四十里。保定敌人和北平老窝更接不上气了。
    在山东，咱又捉住了国民党的又一个中央委员庞镜塘。济南解放后他打扮成商人想往徐州跑，到半路叫解放军截住了。因此国民党中央委员被俘和投降的已有五个人，另外四个是康泽、王耀武、范汉杰、郑洞国。
    晋中区和太行十四县的民兵民工大批赶到前线，高喊着：“打到太原去，活捉阎锡山！”没有解放军打不下的城市，太原一定也要落到咱手里的！
