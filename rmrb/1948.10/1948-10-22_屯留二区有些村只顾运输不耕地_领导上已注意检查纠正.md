　　【Taiyue Telegraph】Tunliu Second District is inspecting autumn harvest and autumn plowing in various villages. The autumn harvest in the entire district is nearing completion, but only eight villages, including Xu Village and Yuan Chen, have achieved simultaneous harvesting and plowing. Half of the villages have not even started. Among them, some villages have organized a large number of livestock for transportation outside the area. For example, in Quzhuang Village, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, Fu Zhengfa, led thirty-five animals for transportation, and in Dongxingwang, twenty-five carts were also sent out. This is due not only to the idea of prioritizing transportation over autumn plowing, but also to leadership issues: first, the spontaneous flow phenomenon has not been corrected. For example, the village head of Zhonghua Village still says: "Organize autumn plowing? Who doesn't know how to plow the land?" The village head of Dong ×× Village said: "Organize autumn plowing? Last year, forced organization was criticized." Another issue is the lack of working methods, fearing to commit commandism and not daring to lead. In addition, a few cadres still persist in their mistakes and refuse to work. For this reason, the district convened a meeting of more than 500 party members and cadres on August 12th. Comrade Wang Yuncheng, secretary of the branch committee, first made a correct assessment of last year's autumn plowing, explaining that the universal autumn plowing last year ensured that the entire district could seize the seedlings this spring. Although there was a lack of rain in June, it was not affected, and later, the rainfall was even, reaching 80% of a normal year. On the other hand, it also pointed out that the commandism in organizing autumn plowing last year was serious, without distinguishing between circumstances, or between men and women, all were forced to go to the fields to dig the land. Originally, plowing the land was for increasing production, but due to poor methods and approaches, it became everyone's burden. Subsequently, each village discussed in groups, and for those who did not pay attention to autumn plowing and only engaged in transportation, they calculated the accounts. Plowing the land would result in more grain next year, and not plowing the land, even if they earned money from transportation, would not be as good as growing more grain in the fields. Everyone then realized that it was better to plow the land first and then engage in transportation. Then, they reviewed last year's commandism. For example, the village head of Xilian Village reviewed that last year, when organizing autumn plowing, he forced women with bound feet to dig the land, and three women broke their arms as a result. Zhang Shiying, chairman of the Women's Association of Lu Village, also reviewed that last year, in order to be a "model," she forced and organized 270 women to dig the land, and even if their men came out to dig for them or used livestock to help, it was not allowed, and the village would not let everyone attend the village gatherings, which caused dissatisfaction among everyone. After the review, Zhang Zhan×, the village head of Lingshang Village, proposed that this time, in autumn plowing, we must overcome commandism and organize everyone to plow the land. Qin Santing, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Lu Village, immediately presented his own leadership plan. Finally, the district called on everyone to go back and earnestly take the lead in doing a good job in autumn plowing.

　　屯留二区有些村只顾运输不耕地
  　领导上已注意检查纠正
    【太岳电】屯留二区检查各村秋收秋耕。全区秋收已接近完成，但作到边收边耕的只有许村、原晨等八村，有半数村子还没动手。其中有一些村子却组织了大批牲口出外运输。如曲庄村由农会主席副正法带领三十五头牲口去运输，东兴旺也走了二十五辆大车。这除了轻视秋耕重运输思想外，还有领导上的原因：一是自流现象还没纠正。如中华村村长仍说：“还组织秋耕？谁还不知道耕地？”东××村村长说：“还组织秋耕？去年强迫组织受到了批评。”另一种是缺乏工作办法，怕犯强迫命令，不敢领导。另外，有少数干部还坚持错误，躺倒不干。为此区上于八月十二日召集全区五百余党员干部会议，分委书记王允诚同志先对去年秋耕作了正确的估价，说明全区由于去年普遍进行了秋垡，保证了今春能全部捉住苗，六月虽缺雨，也未受到影响，加之后来雨水调匀，达到了八成年景。另一方面也指出去年在组织秋耕中强迫命令是严重的，不分情况，不分男女，一律强迫上地刨地。原来耕地是为了增产，因方法方式不好，变成了大家的负担。随后各村分组讨论，对于不重视秋耕而只搞运输的算了一下帐，耕了地明年就能多打粮食，不耕地光运输赚了钱也不如地里多打下粮食，大家才转过来，还是先耕地后运输好。接着检讨去年的强迫命令，如西莲村长检讨到去年组织秋耕中强迫小脚妇女上地刨地，有三个妇女因此把胳膊扭坏了。路村妇会主席张是英，也检讨去年为了当“模范”，强迫组织二百七十个妇女刨地，人家男人出来代刨或用牲口替都不行，村里起会也不让大家赶会，因此引起大家的不满。经过检讨后，岭上村村长张占×就提出来这次在秋耕中一定要克服强迫命令，要组织大家耕地。路村农会主席秦三廷当场打出自己的领导计划。最后，区上号召大家回去切实带头把秋耕工作作好。
