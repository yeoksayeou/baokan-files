Criticism and Suggestions

    Fanshi County Tax Collection Office
    Should Not Confiscate Water Pipes

To the Editor:

    The people in the Fanshi area have always enjoyed smoking water pipes. Many locals, when transporting grain to Daixian in Jin-Sui, often bring back some water pipe tobacco, both for their own use and for sale, meeting the needs of the local population. However, starting on August 10th this year, the Fanshi Tax Collection Office began confiscating water pipe tobacco brought back by the people from Jin-Sui. Even those who only brought back a single package were subject to confiscation. The people said, "Even enemy-controlled area cigarettes with stamps can be sold. Why is the water pipe tobacco from our own liberated area being confiscated?" They are all very dissatisfied. However, the Fanshi Tax Collection Office has ignored the people's concerns and has confiscated dozens of cases within a month.

    The local products of various liberated areas should be allowed to circulate and should not be restricted. The Fanshi Tax Collection Office has violated the current trade policy. It is hoped that the Fanshi County Government will quickly investigate and correct this practice and return the confiscated items to the people.

### 繁峙县稽征所　不应没收水烟

　　繁峙县稽征所
    不应没收水烟编辑同志：
    在繁峙一带的群众，素来是爱吸水烟的，当地很多群众在贩粮食至晋绥代县时，往往即带回一些水烟，有自己吸的，也有贩卖的，解决了当地群众的需要。谁知今年八月十日开始，繁峙的稽征所即将群众由晋绥带过来的水烟没收了，只带回一包的亦遭到没收。群众说：“敌区的纸烟打了戳子还能卖，为什么自己解放区的水烟要没收呢？”都很不满意。但繁峙稽征所不顾群众反映，在一个月内已没收了数十起了。
    各解决区的土产是应该流通的，不应该加以限制，繁峙稽征所违反了当前的贸易政策，希望繁峙县府快检查纠正这种作法，并把过去没收的退回给群众。
