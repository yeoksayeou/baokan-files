　　Equipping Capable Teachers
  　Zhengding City Rectifies Primary Education
    [Beiyue News] Zhengding City has historically been highly developed in culture and education. At its peak, the city had over 3,200 children enrolled in schools and over 100 teachers and staff. After the first liberation of Zhengding, thanks to the efforts of the democratic government, enrollment recovered to over 2,000 children. However, after two invasions by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the citizens suffered brutal plunder and devastation, leading to widespread hardship and forcing some children to drop out of school. This spring, enrollment was only over 900 children, which dropped to over 500 before the autumn break, accounting for approximately 13% of the city's school-age children. In addition to the impact of the citizens' hardship due to the brutal looting by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, there are also the following subjective reasons for the low enrollment: (1) Since the land conference, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have not provided enough leadership for national education. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government rarely raise or study national education issues in meetings. (2) The quality of teachers is low. Among the 20 primary school teachers in the city, 12 lack teaching ability, six have a level of education below junior high school, and only four are relatively capable of teaching. Furthermore, two teachers have speech impediments, making it difficult for children to understand the lessons. (3) Salary payments and grain supplies are not timely, and office expenses are insufficient for minimum expenditures. The six teachers of one primary school received their August salary in grain a total of three times, and it was not fully paid until September 6th. The office expenses for the third primary school were 28 jin of grain, which, when converted into cash, was only enough to cover the cost of lamp oil, chalk, and ink, leaving no funds for newspapers and textbooks. (4) Management is lax, and citizens generally reflect that "there are no rules in schools, children can't learn many characters, and it's better to collect firewood at home." The Municipal Party Committee has summarized past national education and has now transferred teachers with experience and ability to teach, appropriately equipped the teachers, and is working to unite and transform old intellectuals. The salaries and grain for primary school teachers are guaranteed to be supplied on time, and office expenses will be appropriately increased. Plans are being made to repair the buildings. This winter, there are also plans to launch a large number of night schools to supplement the education of out-of-school children. On September 23rd, a joint meeting of all teachers and education committees in the city was held to formulate a teaching plan for this semester, with a principle of 1,170 minutes of teaching time per week. Regular school committee meetings are held, and parent meetings and individual visits are planned. While opposing the principle of punitive actions, children's management is strengthened. In addition to insisting on one hour of study each day, teachers participate in collective study led by the Civil Education Section on Sundays.

　　配备有能力的教员
  　正定市整顿小学教育
    【北岳讯】正定市历来文化教育极为发达，全市入学儿童曾达三千二百余，教职员百余人。正定第一次解放后，在民主政府努力下，恢复到二千多儿童入学，后经蒋匪两次侵占，市民遭到残酷掠夺与蹂躏，生活普遍困难，迫使部分儿童失学，今春入学儿童只有九百余人，到秋假前成了五百余，约占全市学龄儿童百分之十三。除市民因遭受蒋匪残酷抢掠致使生活困难影响儿童入学外，尚有以下几个主观原因：（一）市委和市政府自土地会议后，对国民教育领导不够，市委和市政府会上很少提出或研究国民教育问题。（二）教员质量低，全市初小教员二十人，十二人无教学能力，六人高小以下程度，较有教学能力的只有四人，并有两个教员口齿不清，儿童听课困难。（三）薪金米供给不及时，办公费不够最低限度开支，一初小六个教员八月份薪金米共领三次，九月六号才算全部领齐，三初小办公费二十八斤米，折款后除开支灯油、粉笔、墨水外，报费、课本均无法解决。（四）管理松懈，市民普遍反映“学校里没规矩，识不了几个字，还不如在家拾柴好哩”。市委总结了过去的国民教育后，现已调来对教学有经验与有能力的先生，适当的配备了教员，正进行团结与改造旧知识分子，初小教员薪金米保证按时供给，并适当增多办公费，准备修补房屋。今冬并计划大量开展夜校，补充失学儿童的学习。九月二十三日召开全市教员教委联席会，订出本学期教学计划，每周教学时间以一千一百七十分钟为原则。定期召开校委会议，有计划召开家长座谈会和个别访问。在反对惩办主义原则下，加强儿童管理，教员除每日坚持一小时学习外，在星期日由民教科负责领导集体学习。
