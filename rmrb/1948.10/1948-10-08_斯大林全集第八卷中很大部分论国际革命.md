Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to the Electronegative News Agency, Moscow: A significant portion of Volume VIII of Stalin's Collected Works addresses the international revolutionary movement. Stalin's writings from over twenty years ago regarding the war in China and the tactics of the Communist Party in the anti-imperialist struggle are entirely applicable to the current situation. *Truth* newspaper, in its review of the book, pointed out: In his 1926 report, "On the Future of the Chinese Revolution," Stalin already called for attention to the new forms that imperialist intervention might take – not using its own armed forces but instigating civil wars within countries it had ambitions for, and financially supporting counter-revolutionary forces. *Truth* commented: The correctness of this analysis is evident; the United States is now a living example of this new type of imperialist intervention, not only in its aid to Kuomintang China but also in its aid to Royalist Greece. Stalin foresaw in 1926 that the future development of China would lead to something similar to the proletarian and peasant democratic dictatorship discussed in Russia in 1905, except that this dictatorship would be anti-imperialist in nature during the transition towards a socialist China. *Truth* said: This view is as correct today as it was twenty-two years ago.

Volume VIII of the Collected Works also contains Stalin's reports to the Executive Committee of the Communist International, which are of particular importance today when the relationship of Communist parties to the international movement has become a topic of discussion in many countries. In his 1926 article, "On the Anglo-Russian Committee," Stalin commented on the arguments of British Communists at the time, namely that the special circumstances and traditions of Britain made it difficult to apply the principles of Marxism in Britain, saying: "Naturally, there are characteristics in the British working-class movement, and these must be taken into account, but to elevate these characteristics into a principle and make these characteristics the foundation of your work is to place yourselves in the position of those who declare that Marxism is not applicable to British national conditions." Stalin emphasized the importance of fraternal Communist parties carrying out work in the trade union movement, even if the trade unions are reactionary. Any attempt to "bypass" this most basic organization of the working class is an adventurous policy. Some people then, and today, argue that the Communist Party of each country should go its own way. Stalin answered them clearly and irrefutably: "If you do not recognize the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the international anti-imperialist struggle, then you cannot be a true proletarian revolutionary."

　　斯大林全集第八卷中很大部分论国际革命
    【新华社陕北五日电】据电通社莫斯科讯：斯大林全集第八卷中有很大部分涉及国际革命运动。斯大林二十余年前所写的关于中国的战争及共产党人在反帝斗争中的策略，完全适合于当前的情势。真理报在评述该书时指出：斯大林在其一九二六年所作的“论中国革命前途”报告中，即已要求注意帝国主义干涉可能采取的新形式——不用它自己的武装而在其对之有野心的国家内挑起内战，在财政上资助反革命势力。真理报评称：这个分析的正确性是显然的，美国现在便是新式帝国主义干涉的活例，这不仅是在其对国民党中国的援助而且也在其对保皇党希腊的援助中。斯大林一九二六年曾预见中国未来的发展是导向与一九○五年俄国所谈论过的无产阶级与农民民主专政相似的东西，所不同的是这种专政在走向社会主义中国的过渡期间，在本质上是反帝国主义的。真理报说：这个观点今天正如二十二年前一样的正确。
    该全集第八卷中尚载有斯大林对共产国际执委会的某些报告，这在今天当各国共产党对国际运动的关系在许多国家成为论题时，具有特别重要意义。斯大林在其一九二六年所写的“论英俄委员会”一文中，对英国共产党人当时的主张，即英国的特殊情况与传统，使马克思主义的原则难以应用于英国的主张，曾予评论称：“自然，英国工人阶级运动中的特性是存在的，而且须予考虑，但是如把这些特性提高成为一个原则，且以这些特性为你们工作的基础，那便是使你们自己处于宣布马克思主义不适用于英国国情者的地位。”斯大林强调指出各兄弟共产党在职工运动中进行工作的重要性，即使职工会是反动的，也是这样。任何“绕过”工人阶级这种最初步组织的企图，都是冒险的政策。有些人那时和今天都主张每一国家的共产党应该走它自己的道路，斯大林明白而不可辩驳地答复他们说：“如果你们不承认联共党在国际反帝斗争阵线中的领导作用，那你们就不能是真正的无产阶级革命者。”
