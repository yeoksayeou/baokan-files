On the 16th, they submitted a review report to the Congress. Based on this report, the Congress passed the following resolution:

　　"The Congress was extremely satisfied after listening to the report by Comrade Bo Yibo, representative of the North China Communist Party, on the North China People's Government's administrative policy. Representative Bo's report analyzed the current environment of the North China Liberated Area and the actual situation in the military, political, and economic aspects, pointing out the characteristics and superior conditions of the North China Liberated Area. Based on these characteristics and conditions, he put forward the administrative policy that the North China People's Government should adopt, which is:

　　In the military aspect, in order to completely eliminate all remaining military forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries in North China, completely liberate all cities and villages, large and small, in North China, and to cooperate with and support the People's Liberation Army and fraternal liberated areas throughout the country in defeating the Kuomintang reactionary rule aided by American imperialism and liberating all of China, we must make every effort to continue to improve the combat effectiveness of the North China Field Army and local troops, especially the Field Army's ability to attack fortified positions, as well as continue to strengthen the people's armed forces, and mobilize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources in North China to support the front lines.

　　In the economic aspect, in order to restore and develop agricultural and industrial production so that it can be improved from the existing foundation, for agriculture, it is necessary to promote the organization of farmers' production and consumption cooperation and mutual assistance on the active side, encourage agricultural technical improvement and rural sideline occupations, issue agricultural loans, and help farmers produce. On the passive side, do not waste people's labor and do not increase the burden on the people. The agricultural tax amount shall not exceed 20% of the average total agricultural income of the entire region; for industry, we must resolutely implement the general policy of developing production, prospering the economy, benefiting both public and private sectors, and benefiting both labor and capital, rectify the labor movement policy, and improve the management methods of state-owned enterprises. At the same time, for commerce, state-owned stores and cooperatives must change their business methods of simply pursuing profits, and instead, in a planned and practical way, lead the market, control foreign trade, and communicate and adjust the needs of the vast producers and consumers to promote production and stabilize prices. In addition, all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the people's livelihood should continue to be encouraged and protected.

　　In the political aspect, it is necessary to rectify district and village-level organizations as the foundation for democratic governance, quickly establish people's representative conferences at all levels, and elect people's governments at all levels; it is necessary to guarantee the people's rights to physical integrity, freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, movement, belief, and all other democratic freedoms; in addition, the principles of equality between men and women and equality among nationalities must also be established.

　　In the aspect of culture and education, it is necessary to promote compulsory education in a planned and step-by-step manner, establish various formal education systems according to possibility and necessity, improve cultural standards, cultivate a large number of cadres, consolidate and expand the united front in culture, and unite and educate all democratic intellectuals to jointly serve the cause of building the North China Liberated Area.

　　In the work in newly liberated areas and newly liberated cities, it is necessary to adopt a policy of protection and construction. All reactionary armed forces must be completely eliminated, counter-revolutionary criminals with heinous crimes must be severely punished according to law, and bureaucratic capital must be confiscated and placed under the administration of the People's Government. However, a lenient policy should be adopted towards general staff members in bandit and puppet organizations and accomplices who do not continue to resist and sabotage; they should not be arrested, but should be employed separately, those with merit should be rewarded, and those with guilt should be punished. As for individuals and groups who generally abide by the laws and decrees of the democratic government, they should all be protected.

　　The Congress unanimously believes that the content of Representative Bo's report meets the current needs and should be adopted as the administrative policy of the North China People's Government. It is hereby resolved that the North China People's Government should formulate specific implementation measures and implement them promptly."
