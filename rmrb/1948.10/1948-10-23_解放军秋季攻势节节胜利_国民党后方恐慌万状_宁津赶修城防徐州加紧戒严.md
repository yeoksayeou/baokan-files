Xinhua News Agency, East China, 21st – Under the successive victories of the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive on the battlefield, the Kuomintang rear areas are in a state of panic. According to reports from various sources, on September 29th, the fifth day after our army liberated Jinan, the bandit Chiang hurriedly allocated 1.5 million pseudo-gold yuan (equivalent to 450 billion "legal tender") to rush the repair of Nanjing's city defense works. Kuomintang government personnel will be forced to accept military training. A railway protection command will be established on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and a large number of tanks have been assembled in this section for patrols. The Tianjin city defense works are also being rushed. After the news of Jinan's liberation spread throughout Xuzhou, the high-ranking Kuomintang party, government, and military officials, shaken and trembling, moved their families south to Nanjing and Shanghai, and intensified the search of pedestrians and martial law; but the lower-level Kuomintang officers and soldiers said: "The Eighth Route Army's millet rice is already prepared for us." Merchants who have been persecuted by the Kuomintang are exceptionally excited about this news, universally talking about the People's Liberation Army's strict discipline and protection of industry and commerce. One merchant said: "When the People's Liberation Army attacked Yanzhou in July this year, a group of sugar and tea merchants happened to pass by. Because they did not understand the policies of the People's Liberation Army, they bought a batch and hurriedly transported it from the station into the city. However, some had not yet been moved when the station was occupied by the People's Liberation Army. The merchants thought this was the end; but the result was just the opposite. The tea and sugar moved into the city were looted by the Kuomintang bandit troops, while the goods left at the station were properly protected by the People's Liberation Army. As soon as the battle ended, the original owners were notified to claim them with a list, and those without a list were also returned after proper proof." Another merchant said: "At this time last year, half of the people in Xuzhou were inclined to the Eighth Route Army, but now it is eight or nine out of ten."

　　解放军秋季攻势节节胜利
  　国民党后方恐慌万状
  　宁津赶修城防徐州加紧戒严
    【新华社华东二十一日电】在战场人民解放军节节胜利的秋季攻势下，国民党后方恐慌万状。据各方报导，九月二十九日，即我军解放济南后的第五天，蒋贼慌忙拨伪金圆券一百五十万元（合“法币”四万五千万亿）赶修南京城防工事。国民党政府工作人员将被迫接受军训。津浦铁路南段将成立护路司令部，大批战车已集结该段，出动巡逻。天津城防工事也正加紧赶工。当济南解放的消息传遍徐州以后，震骇得发抖的国民党党、政、军高级官员，纷纷将其家属南移京沪，并加紧搜查行人及戒严；但国民党的下层官兵却说：“八路军的小米饭早给咱准备好了”。备受国民党迫害的商人，对这一消息异常兴奋，普遍地交谈着解放军纪律严明保护工商业的故事，有一位客商说：“当今年七月间解放军攻打兖州时，恰巧有一帮糖、茶商人经过那里，因为不了解解放军的政策，所以购了一批，就急忙从车站往城里运一批，但有的还没有搬完，车站就给解放军占领了，商人认为这下可完了；但结果却正好相反，搬到城里的茶叶和糖被国民党匪军抢光了，而未及搬运留在车站上的货物却为解放军派岗妥为保护，战事一结束，即通告原主凭清单去认领，没有清单的经过适当证明手续后也给领回。”另一位客商说：“去年此时，徐州有一半人倾向八路军的，现在就有十分八九了。”
