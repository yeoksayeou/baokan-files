　　【Taihang News】 Xiyang is currently universally carrying out autumn ploughing. The main difficulty discovered during autumn ploughing is the livestock problem. (1) The most common and serious problem is that donkeys are not being harnessed, and only cattle are being used for ploughing. In Li Jia Zhuang base area of the First District, only five sets of donkeys are ploughing the land in sixteen villages. This situation exists in all districts. The reasons are (1) The contradiction between transporting grain and autumn ploughing. The masses in Beizhangcheng reflected that after sending one load of grain, the donkeys don't eat grass for several days. Asking them to plough the land after that is simply killing them! The masses in the Fifth District said: Let them rest for a few days to prepare for participating in the war! (2) Some transportation is more profitable than autumn ploughing. (3) The Second and Fourth Districts have old habits of year-round grain trafficking and "donkeys not being harnessed." (4) In past crash autumn ploughing campaigns, work points were not clearly recorded, and wage payments were delayed and have not been cleared to this day. Some suffered losses, some benefited, and farmers do not trust each other, fearing that their livestock will be ruined. Ma Jia Yu in the Fourth District solved this problem by first calculating the number of cattle and acres of cultivated land in the entire village among the cadres, proving that cattle alone could not finish the ploughing. They also calculated the contrast between the profits of transportation and ploughing. Selling charcoal once, with one person and two donkeys, earns at most 2,400 yuan in two days; but ploughing the land with one person and two donkeys, ploughing one and a half mu of land a day, and earning six sheng of corn, can earn 1,800 yuan, or 3,600 yuan in two days. Good donkeys can plough two mu a day, earning even more. In this way, the cadres' thinking was cleared, and then it was discussed and deliberated among the masses. Those with livestock all said that ploughing was better than selling charcoal, and those without livestock also said it wasn't too expensive. In this way, everyone agreed to organize livestock to be harnessed under the principle of mutual benefit. This method exists in all districts, as autumn ploughing is a long-term benefit and is time-sensitive, so it cannot be delayed. In addition, Guo Youzhong in Bazhou, First District, organized people to democratically elect reliable older people to plough the land. They have the skills to plough and use livestock, their efficiency is high, and everyone is satisfied. (2) The fact that military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, orphans, and widows, those without labor or livestock, cannot plough the land is also a common problem. All districts have also come up with some solutions. The Fourth District first calculated the benefits of autumn ploughing with households without livestock, mobilized them to think of ways to find relatives and friends to help, and also organized households with livestock to sell surplus livestock labor. It is guaranteed that whoever ploughs the land will receive equal wages. Both parties can freely negotiate. For those with a lot of livestock but lacking dry grass, grass can be used to exchange for livestock labor. Some in the First District give one mu of corn stalks for ploughing one mu, some give one mu of grain straw, or light work is exchanged for heavy work, such as sewing and weaving. Or find these people production avenues to earn money to solve the problem. (3) Landlords and rich peasants without livestock, and some sharp individuals, want to rely on others to plough the land. After calculation, these people generally have labor, and they should be organized to use labor to exchange for livestock labor, or find production outlets for them to earn money to plough the land.

　　昔阳解决牲口困难推动农民普遍秋耕
    【太行讯】昔阳各地现正普遍进行秋耕。秋耕中发现的主要困难问题，是牲口问题。（一）最普遍严重的是驴不上套，光让牛耕。一区李家庄基点十六个村，只有五套驴耕地，此种情况各区均有。原因是（１）运粮与秋耕矛盾。北掌城群众反映，送一回粮，驴几天不吃草，再叫它上套耕地，这不是要命哩！五区群众说：歇上几天哇，好准备参战。（２）有些运输比秋耕赚钱多。（３）二、四区有长年贩粮及“毛驴不上套”的旧习惯。（４）历年突击秋耕，记工不清，拖欠工价，至今未清。有的吃亏，有的讨便宜，农民互不凭靠，怕坏了牲口。四区马家峪解决这一问题，首先是在干部中计算了全村的牛与耕地的亩数，证明光牛耕不完。又计算了一下运输与耕地的利益对比。卖炭一回，一夫两驴，两天顶多赚洋二千四百元；但耕地用一夫二驴，一天耕地一亩半，玉茭六升，可赚洋一千八百元，两天即赚三千六百元。好驴一天能耕二亩，即赚的更多。这样，打通了干部思想，又到群众中去酝酿讨论。有牲口的都说耕地比卖炭强，没牲口的也说不算贵。这样，大家都同意在两利的原则下，组织牲口上套。这种作法各区均有，秋耕是长期利益，带有时间性，不能耽误。此外，一区巴州郭有仲组民主推举出可靠的上年纪人去耕地。他们有耕地和使牲口的技术，效率高，大家都满意。（二）军干烈属孤寡、无劳力、无牲口，无法耕地，也是个普遍问题。各区也都想了些解决办法。四区是首先与无牲口户计算秋耕利益，发动他们想办法找亲友帮助，另外组织有畜力户以多余牲口工出卖。保证谁耕地也得出相等工价。双方可自由协商。牲口多而缺干草的，可用草变畜。一区有的耕一亩给一亩玉茭秸，有的是给一亩谷草，或轻工换重工。如做针线、织布等。或给这些人找生产门路，赚钱解决。（三）地主富农无牲口，和一些尖头想依靠别人耕地。经过计算，这些人一般都有劳力，应组织他们用劳力变畜力，或代找生产出路，赚钱耕地。（岁云、贵科、忙小、戍元）
