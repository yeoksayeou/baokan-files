We have seen and heard several things in the 11th sub-district of Central Hebei, which should draw the attention of the leadership of the special county: (1) According to Liu Wenhan, deputy section chief of finance and food in Gaocheng County, since the land redistribution, there has been no dedicated person to manage village finances in the county. Some village cadres live off the government, some live off "canned food" (food rations, asking farmers to bring pots of food to the village office), and some villages use the fruits of victory for financial expenditures. For example, Dongleixia in the first district spent 400 jin of wheat during the wheat collection. (2) Zhujiazhai in Gaocheng over-assessed more than 10,000 jin of public grain last year. According to Zhao Baiwu, chief of the finance and food section of the county (also the current county head of Gaocheng), this is common and not surprising. He also said that before the land redistribution, one village cadre gave his mistress 3,000 jin of public grain at once. This shows that the leadership's control and management of finance in the past was too careless. (3) According to Liu Wenhan, Gaocheng's logistics work is still disorganized, and government agencies, troops, or individual cadres can arbitrarily demand services from villages. Village cadres do not obey orders (such as in Zhujiazhai). (4) Gaocheng's eighth and ninth districts still have detention centers, and people are often detained. In the ninth district, someone was detained for speaking rudely during a divorce dispute, saying it was to "curb his temper." In Nanying, in the fourth district, a rich peasant's cow died. According to village cadres, the death had been reported to them, but because the village cadres did not report it to the district cadres and the work team stationed in the village, the work team and district cadres, without consulting the village cadres, detained the head of the household. The cow was confiscated, and the meat was auctioned off. According to district cadres, several livestock had already died in the village, and they suspected foul play. However, such measures should not be taken before the problem is clarified. (5) In Wumeng Village, Gaocheng, the investigation of the flood disaster involved asking farmers to report the damage themselves at the school. In reality, the village suffered damage to about one hundred acres, but it was reported as more than one hundred and seventy acres. The elementary school teacher wrote down whatever amount was reported, without the district or village cadres checking or reviewing the reports. The villagers believed that submitting the form to the district was completing a task, and the farmers thought that reporting more damage would reduce their burden. We looked around the village and talked with Han Qingshuang, an elementary school teacher, who also said the reports were inaccurate. Are other districts and villages doing the same in such disaster surveys? We hope the leadership of Gaocheng will conduct a thorough investigation.

　　藁城部分区村无纪律现象严重
    我们在冀中十一分区见到与听到几件事，应提起该专县领导上注意：（一）据藁城县财粮副科长刘文汉谈，自平分以来，该县村财政无专人管理，村干部有的吃官饭，有的吃罐饭（派饭，叫农民提着罐子往村公所送），有的村财政开支动用胜利果实，一区东垒下麦征时开支小麦四百斤。（二）藁城朱家寨去年多摊公粮一万余斤。据该县财粮科长赵百武（即现任藁城县长）谈，这是平常事，不足为奇。并说平分前有一个村干部，一次即给他情妇公粮三千斤。由此可见领导上过去对财政的掌握管理太马虎了。（三）据刘文汉谈，藁城现在后勤工作仍无头绪，机关部队或干部个人都可以随便向村中要勤务。村干部不服勤（如朱家寨）。（四）藁城八、九区仍有拘留所，经常押人。九区有一人因闹离婚时说话态度不大好，即被押了起来，说是“圈圈他的性子”。四区南营一个富农死了一头牛，据村干部谈，已向村干部报告了，因村干部没向区干部与驻该村工作组报告，工作组与区干部不问村干，即把该户主扣了起来。牛被没收了，肉也拍卖了。据区干部谈，该村已死了好几个牲口，恐怕是杀害的。但问题未弄清时即不应如此处理。（五）藁城五孟村调查水灾，叫农民自己到学校去报，实际上该村被灾百十来亩，结果报成了一百七十多亩。小学教员是谁报多少就写多少，也没有区村干部掌握审查，村中认为填上表送到区就算完成了一个任务；农民认为多报点可以少负担。我们到该村四周看了一下，和小学教员韩庆双一谈，他也说不确实。类似此等灾情调查，其他区村是否也这样？希望藁城领导上好好检查一下。
