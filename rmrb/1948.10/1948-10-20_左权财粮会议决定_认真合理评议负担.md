　　Taihang Telegram: Zuoquan convened a county-wide meeting of finance and grain cadres in the latter part of last month to examine the shortcomings in last year's burden work and to research and determine improved methods for this year. During last year's handling of the burden, due to being busy with the land reform movement, the county did not systematically deploy this work. In thought, it was considered a "technical work," believing that as long as one could write and calculate, the task could be completed. There was no recognition that burden work is a problem closely related to the lives of the masses, and that if it is not done well, it will affect the living mood of the masses and hinder the development of the production movement. Later, when problems occurred in various villages, the county sent people to the countryside to check, but they did not solve them meticulously. At the district and village leadership levels, this work was not valued, and it was only pushed to the district's finance and grain assistant, the village's finance and grain committee member, and a few appraisers, without the participation of other cadres. In addition, there was an erroneous poor and hired peasant line in the burden work last autumn, which made the burden scores disproportionately light or heavy. The poor and hired peasants could arbitrarily reduce scores, increasing the burden on middle peasants or cadres. For example, five middle peasant households in Dongziyan Village, Fifth District, were overcharged 140,000 yuan, and one cadre in Muchi Village was originally assigned four points, but it was later increased to 24 points. Secondly, the problem of village localism was very serious, which also caused unfairness in the assessment of output. For example, in the interplanted land (land within the boundaries of each village belonging to the other village) between Xiamatian and Yuntoudi villages, according to the geology, the yield per mu should be around 1.6 shi, but Xiamatian was assessed at 2.3 shi, while Yuntoudi was only assessed at 0.8 shi. In addition, there were cases of entire villages lowering output and individuals raising or lowering output to conceal it.

    In order to solve the above problems and make this year's autumn storage fair and reasonable, after everyone discussed in groups, on one hand, ideological problems were solved, and on the other hand, specific methods were studied. Finally, the meeting made specific decisions on overcoming the cadres' incorrect thinking in the past burden work and the methods and steps for carrying out the autumn storage work this year. Ideologically, it must be affirmed that: (1) The burden must be fair and reasonable, and it must be balanced. Not only must households and villages be balanced, but also districts must be balanced. (2) One must be selfless and not self-interested, oppose localism and sectarianism, and correct the phenomenon of raising the output of land on the surface (roadsides and village edges that are easily seen by others) a little bit, and lowering the output of land in remote mountain gullies that people do not often see. (3) Oppose the sentiment of defeatism and overcome the erroneous understanding of burden work that "burdens are handled every year, they are always unfair, there is always a lot of noise, and in the end, it is a mess." (4) Village cadres, especially finance and grain cadres, should not think too much and be afraid of offending people, overcome the backward thinking that "a village that does not reveal its wealth is a good village, and a family that does not reveal its wealth is a good family," and have an overall concept, a national concept, grasp the spirit of the policy, absorb the opinions of the masses, and improve the burden work.

    In terms of methods, village cadres should specifically lead the selection of appraisers (one person for every ten households) to form an appraisal committee. The qualifications of the appraisers are that they are selfless, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and are familiar with the local land conditions. This year, the central link of Zuoquan's burden work is to measure the land and assess the output through sampling. Meetings should be held to discuss the assessments, publish them for discussion and review, and then finalize them. Finally, household-by-household registration should be carried out and summarized into accounts.

    In terms of organizational leadership, a burden committee should be established in the county, with responsible comrades from various departments participating, and the county head as the director. Two inspection teams should be organized to be responsible for inspecting the implementation of the burden policy in various places. A similar organization should also be established in the district to resolve conflicts between villages and other specific issues.

### 左权财粮会议决定　认真合理评议负担

　　左权财粮会议决定
  　认真合理评议负担
    【太行电】左权于上月下旬召开了全县财粮干部会议，检查了去年负担工作中的缺点，研究确定了今年改进的办法。在去年办负担时，因忙于搞土改运动，县里没有系统的布置这一工作，思想上认为那是个“技术工作”，只要能写会算就能完成这个任务，没有认识到负担工作是和群众生活有密切关系的问题，如果搞的不好，它会影响群众的生活情绪，阻碍生产运动的开展。后来各村发生了问题，县里才派人下乡检查，但也没有细致的去解决。区村领导上，对这一工作也没有重视起来，只推给区的财粮助理员村的财粮委员和几个评议员去搞，其他干部都没有参加。加以去秋在负担工作上存在着错误的贫雇路线，使负担分数畸轻畸重，贫雇可以随便减分，加重中农或干部的负担。如五区洞子岩村五户中农，就多加了十四万元，沐池村一个干部，原派他四分，后来竟加到二十四分。其次是村本位问题很严重，也造成了产量的评议不公现象。如下麻田与云头底两村的插花地（两村地界内互有他村地），按地质来说，两块每亩应产量该是一石六斗上下，可是下麻田就评成二石三斗，云头底只评了八斗。另外还有全村降低产量与私人提高或降低隐瞒产量的情形。
    为了解决上述问题，使今年的秋屯做到公平合理，经大家分组讨论，一面解决思想问题，一面研究具体作法，最后会议对克服过去负担工作上干部不正确的思想以及今年进行秋屯工作的方法和步骤作出具体的决定。在思想上必须肯定认识：（一）负担要作到公平合理，要作到平衡，不仅户与户村与村要平衡，就是区与区也要作到平衡。（二）要大公无私不自私自利，反对闹本位闹宗派，纠正脸面上的土地（路边村边别人容易看得见的）就提高一点产量，偏僻山沟人不常看见的土地就降低产量的现象。（三）反对失败主义的情绪，克服“年年办负担，总弄不公道，一直糊圪吵，结果糊拉倒”这种对负担工作的错误认识。（四）村干部特别是财粮干部不要前思后虑怕惹人，克服“村不露是好村，家不露是好家”的落后思想，要有整体观念，国家观念，掌握政策精神，吸收群众意见，改进负担工作。
    在作法上村干部要具体领导选出评议员（每十户选一人），成立评议委员会。评议员的条件是大公无私虚心听取群众意见，并熟悉当地土地情况的。今年左权负担工作的中心一环，是抽丈土地抽评产量。要开会评议出榜公布讨论复评作为定案，最后还要进行逐户登记总结成帐。
    在组织领导上，县里成立负担委员会，各重门负责同志参加，县长为主任。并组织两个检查小组，负责检查各地负担政策的执行问题。区里也要有这个组织，以解决村与村之间的矛盾和其他具体问题。
