    Braving Wind and Rain
    ——The Story of a Vegetable Procurement Officer at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction Site
    Feng Jian
    It was already dark. The northeast wind was blowing harder and harder.

    Because of the gloomy weather and strong wind, there were fewer people buying vegetables in the garden, so Liu Xiaohe bought two or three thousand more catties of vegetables than usual. The difficult thing was that the vegetables were bulky, and Old Deng and his son's boat couldn't load all ten thousand catties of vegetables no matter what. The annoying wind seemed to be deliberately causing trouble, blowing relentlessly. With strong winds and waves, the wooden boats on the Yangtze River had long gone to shelter from the wind. Who would be willing to take the risk of traveling more than thirty miles of waterway overnight to deliver the vegetables to the construction site? Thinking of this, Liu Xiaohe felt a heavy weight in his heart, as if he had a large lead block hanging there.

    The wind by the river was even stronger. It was already past nine o'clock. Liu Xiaohe rolled up his sleeves and, leading the porters, loaded and loaded, finally loading more than six thousand catties onto Old Deng's boat, with three or four thousand catties still sitting on the shore.

    In the ditches near the river, several small boats were moored to shelter from the wind. Liu Xiaohe stepped up two steps and shouted loudly:
    "Boat!" No one responded.
    "Boat!"
    After shouting twice, someone came out of the cabin. By the dim light of the oil lamp on the boat, Liu Xiaohe saw that this person was about fifty years old, with deep wrinkles on his ruddy face, a rather sturdy old boatman.
    "There are three or four thousand catties of vegetables, load them onto the boat!"
    "No, no! With such a big wind, I can't sail the boat." The boatman refused, and as he spoke, he burrowed back into the cabin.
    Liu Xiaohe's heart sank. He said in a negotiating tone:
    "Comrade, three or four thousand catties of vegetables. Load them first, it's okay if you don't sail."
    The old boatman snorted. Liu Xiaohe quickly called the porters to load the vegetables and asked the boatman to bring the boat closer to Old Deng's boat.

    He nimbly jumped onto the bow of the boat and habitually lit a cigarette. Staring at the surging Yangtze River, his heart felt like a bucket of water, churning up and down.

    Since Liu Xiaohe was transferred to the construction site to procure vegetables in the spring, he had been rushing back to the construction site by boat almost every night; today, he encountered such a big storm...

    He thought of the few sentences he used to say: Wuhan Iron and Steel is a major national project, construction requires everyone's support, and we should do our part to contribute to its construction. He felt a flush on his face and said eagerly to Old Deng, "If we don't get back tonight, there will be no vegetables to eat at the construction site tomorrow."

    Old Deng looked at the river and said nothing. Usually, if the wind reached level five during the day, small wooden boats would not dare to sail; today, it was even stronger than a level five wind, and it was night, how could they sail? He thought this way, but Old Deng didn't say it out loud.

    Liu Xiaohe, with his brows tightly furrowed, said to the old boatman, as if ordering and pleading:
    "Let's sail the boat, comrade."
    "What? Sail the boat?" The old boatman poked his head out of the cabin and asked in a mocking and provocative tone: "Are you afraid? If you're not afraid, then let's sail the boat!"

    This old boatman, who had experienced decades of risks on the water, thought that this sentence would scare Liu Xiaohe, but he completely did not expect that Liu Xiaohe was a resolute person. He immediately answered bluntly:
    "I'm not afraid. I won't ride Old Deng's big boat, I insist on riding your small boat." As he spoke, he jumped onto the old boatman's boat in one stride.

    Unexpectedly, Liu Xiaohe's words provoked the old boatman. The old boatman challenged him again:
    "If you're not afraid, let's go, let's sail the boat!"

    The old boatman and Old Deng creaked as they hoisted the sails. As soon as they weighed anchor, the two boats shot towards the center of the river like arrows.

    The wind dragged the sails, and the two boats were quickly pulled into the raging waves. The boat tilted violently, revealing half of the bottom. The wind, like a demon, grabbed the two small boats with its huge demon hands, pushing them onto the crest of the waves one moment and throwing them into the huge waves the next. At this time, Liu Xiaohe was leaning tightly against the mast, helping the boatman pull the awning rope. He was thirty-two years old, had herded cattle, carried vegetables, but had never experienced such a storm as today. He said he wasn't afraid, but his heart couldn't help but beat wildly.

    When they were about to reach the opposite bank, suddenly, with a whooshing sound, a gust of wind swept in. Then, several waves crashed in from the side in succession. The river water splashed on Liu Xiaohe's face and body.

    The quick-witted old boatman saw it at a glance and asked, "Is it leaking?"
    "Heh."
    "How much water is in?"
    Liu Xiaohe looked at the cabin, and the water was already half a foot deep. He hesitated for a moment: "Um—a little, it doesn't matter."
    "How much is in, exactly?" The boatman didn't believe him.
    "Just a little, it's okay."

    Driven from one wave to another, the two boats finally drifted to the opposite bank. Old Deng breathed a sigh of relief and asked Liu Xiaohe, "Are you afraid you can't go forward?"
    "Can't go forward?" Liu Xiaohe looked at the stone-built embankment, deliberately turned his head away, and said to the old boatman, "There was still a place to moor the boat at the wharf on the opposite bank just now; look at the slippery slope here, you can't moor the boat even if you want to."
    "The waves are too big, I'm not taking the risk," the boatman disagreed.
    "The riverbank is a slow current, the waves are smaller; go slowly."
    "I can't row anymore." The old boatman deliberately raised another difficulty.

    This made Liu Xiaohe feel embarrassed. He thought about it and simply hardened his heart and told a lie: "I'll help you row."
    "You can row?"
    "Um." Liu Xiaohe responded vaguely, "Look, the water has entered the cabin, and the vegetables are all wet. If they rot overnight, thousands of people at the construction site will still be waiting to eat them."

    The old boatman grumbled a few words, but didn't say anything else.

    The two boats lowered their sails at the same time and rowed one after the other. Now they were sailing along the riverbank downstream, the waves were much smaller, but they were facing a headwind.

    Rowing the boat against the wind made it difficult to even breathe. Putting all your strength into a stroke could only move you forward a small step. The boat was rushing against the waves, rising and falling, making it even harder to move than pulling a boat upstream.

    In the distance, a long string of lights from the workers' village appeared faintly. Liu Xiaohe stopped paddling, moved his sore and tired arms, and exhaled a long breath, saying, "It's not far."

    As soon as the words fell, a gust of cold wind suddenly struck, and Liu Xiaohe couldn't help but shiver. The lights of the workers' village disappeared into the darkness in the blink of an eye. The wind carried sand and dust, rustling on the shore.

    The dark clouds flew lower and lower, gathering darker and darker. Suddenly, several dazzling white flashes of lightning brought deafening thunder. In an instant, torrential rain poured down.

    The rain grew heavier and heavier, and the sound of thunder became more and more intense. Heavy rain and rolling waves surged into the cabin, flattening the raised bow of the boat.
    "Oh no, find a place to anchor."
    The old boatman looked around and saw that there was no place to moor the boat, and asked helplessly, "How far did you say it was just now?"
    "It's not far. We'll be there in a little while."
    "More water in the cabin again?" Without waiting for Liu Xiaohe to answer, he quickly asked again, "How much is in?"
    "Not much—a little more." In fact, the water in the cabin was already a foot deep.

    The rain was mercilessly pouring on Liu Xiaohe's eyes, soaking his clothes. The wind was blowing wantonly, rolling up huge waves and crashing against the bow of the boat. Liu Xiaohe, the old boatman, Old Deng and his son, none of them said a word, silently rowing, rowing...

    At one o'clock in the morning, the boat rowed into the Wufeng Lock pier near the construction site and anchored alongside the shore. The old boatman wiped the rain and sweat from his forehead, took a large wooden ladle and walked to the front cabin. He ladled the water out of the front cabin, one ladle at a time, while glaring at Liu Xiaohe and complaining:
    "I've been sailing a boat all my life, and I've never met a stubborn person like you. Next time, don't even think about hiring my boat to deliver vegetables again. Go, quickly find someone to unload the vegetables."

    Liu Xiaohe ignored him, jumped ashore, and went straight to the construction site. Only then did he feel sore and tired limbs, weary and hungry, soaked to the bone like a drowned chicken. He had only eaten early in the morning.

    The wind gradually subsided. Liu Xiaohe couldn't help but smile as he thought about how tomorrow morning, more than ten thousand catties of fresh and tender vegetables would be displayed on the stalls of the construction site vegetable market.

    风雨赶舟
    ——武钢工地一个蔬菜采购员的故事
    冯健
    天已经黑了。东北风越刮越紧。
    天阴风大，到园子里买菜的人少，刘小和比平日多买到了两三千斤蔬菜。难为人的是，菜是泡泡货，老邓父子俩那条船，怎么也装不完这一万多斤菜。讨厌的大风，却有意跟人闹蹩扭，一股劲儿地刮个不停。风大浪猛，长江上的木划子早就避风去了，谁愿意担这个风险，连夜赶三十多里水路把菜送往工地？刘小和想到这里，心里沉甸甸地，像是吊了个大铅块。
    江边的风更大。已经九点多了，刘小和卷起袖筒，领着搬运工人左装右装，才在老邓船上装了六千多斤，还有三、四千斤在岸上摆着。
    靠江边的沟壕里，停了几支小船在避风。刘小和跨上去两步，高声喊道：
    “划子！”没人应声。
    “划子！”
    连喊了两声，才有人从船舱里走出来。借着船上昏黄的马灯光，刘小和看见这个人约摸有五十多岁，枣红的脸上有着深深的皱纹，是个蛮壮实的老艄公。
    “有三、四千斤菜，装上船吧！”
    “不行，不行！这么大的风，开不了船。”船家拒绝了，一边说着，一边又往船舱里钻。
    刘小和心里顿了一下。就用商量的口气说：
    “同志，三、四千斤菜呐。先装上，不开船也行。”
    老船家哼了一声。刘小和连忙招呼搬运工人装菜，又叫船家把划子靠拢了老邓的船。
    他轻捷地跳上船头，习惯地点燃了一支香烟。凝视着奔腾澎湃的长江，心里像吊了个水桶，七上八下地翻腾起来。
    自从春天刘小和调到工地采购蔬菜，几乎是天天夜晚赶船回工地；今天，遇上了这么大的风浪……。
    他想起了过去常说过的几句话：武钢是国家的大工程，建设要大家支援，应该为它的建设尽一份力量。觉得脸上一阵发热，急切地对老邓说：“今夜赶不回去，明天工地就没菜吃。”
    老邓看了看江，没说什么。平常，大白天刮起五级风，小木船就不敢开航了；今天，比五级风还猛，又是夜晚，怎么能开船呢？想是这样想，可是老邓没说出口。
    刘小和紧锁着眉头，像命令又像恳求地对老船家说：
    “我们还是开船吧，同志。”
    “什么？开船？”老船家从船舱里探出头来，带着讥笑的挑逗的语气问：“你怕不怕？你要不怕，就开船好啦！”
    这个在水上经历了几十年风险的老船家，满以为这句话会把刘小和吓住，却完全没有料到刘小和是个刚强性子。他马上直截了当地回答：
    “我不怕。老邓的大船不坐，偏要坐你的小船哩。”说时，一个箭步就跳上了老船家的船。
    不想刘小和这句话倒把老船家激住了。老船家就又挑战似的说：
    “你不怕，走，开船！”
    老船家和老邓格吱吱地扯起了风帆。一启锚，两条船就像箭似的射向江心去了。
    风曳着帆，把两条船很快就拖进了惊涛骇浪。船身剧烈地倾斜着，露出了半个船底。风跟魔鬼一样，用它巨大的魔掌攫住两支小船，一忽儿把它们推上浪头，一忽儿又把它们摔进巨浪中。刘小和这时紧靠桅杆，帮船家拉着篷索。他长到三十二岁，放过牛，担过菜，却从没有经历过今天这样的风浪。他嘴里说不怕，心里禁不住砰砰跳。
    快到对岸的时候，猛然间呜的一声，卷来了一阵劲风。接着从侧面一连扑来了几个浪头。江水扑打在刘小和的脸上和身上。
    机灵的老船家一眼就看见了，忙问：“进水了？”
    “呵。”
    “进了多少？”
    刘小和一看船舱，水已经有半尺深了。他犹豫了一下：“嗯——进了一点，不要紧。”
    “到底进了多少？”船家不相信。
    “一点点，没关系。”
    从一个浪头被赶到另一个浪头，两只船终于飘到了对岸。老邓舒了口气，问刘小和：“怕不能往前走了吧。”
      “不能往前走？”刘小和看了看石块砌成的驳岸，有意扭过头去，向着老船家说：“刚才对岸码头上，还有个湾船的地方；你看这里的河坡滑溜溜的，想湾船也湾不住。”
    “浪太大，我不冒这份险了。”船家不同意地说。
    “江边是缓流，浪小些；慢慢走。”
    “我划不动了。”老船家又故意提出难题。
    这可把刘小和难住了。他想了想，索性硬着头皮扯了个谎：“我帮你荡桨。”
    “你会荡？”
    “嗯。”刘小和含糊地应了一声，“你看，船舱里进了水，菜都打湿了。过一夜，菜烂了，工地上成千上万的人还等着吃菜呢。”
    老船家咕哝了几句什么，再也没说话了。
    两支船同时落了篷，一前一后地划着。现在是沿着江边顺水行船，浪小多了，却迎面碰上顶头风。
    兜着风荡船，连咽气都困难万分。拿出全身力气划一桨，只能前进一小步。船冲着浪，一起一伏，比逆水拉纤还难走。
    远方隐隐约约出现了工人村的一长串灯光。刘小和停住桨，活动了一下又酸又累的臂膀，长嘘口气说：“不远了。”
    话刚落音，突然一阵冷风袭来，刘小和不禁打了个寒噤。工人村的灯火一眨眼又隐没到黑暗中去了。风挟着砂尘，在岸上沙沙作响。
    乌云越飞越低，越聚越黑。猛地，几道刺眼的白色闪电，带来了震耳的雷声。一霎时，瓢泼的暴雨倾泻下来。
    雨越来越大，霹雳的雷声一阵紧过一阵。急雨和翻滚的骇浪，一阵阵涌进船舱，把翘着的船头压平了。
      “哎呀，找个地方抛锚吧。”
    老船家看了看四下没有靠船的地方，又无可奈何地问。“你刚才说，还有多远呢？”
    “不远了。再划一会就到了。”
    “舱里又进了水？”没等刘小和回答，连忙又问：“进了多少？”
    “不多——，又进了一点点。”其实，船舱里已经有尺把深的水了。
    雨，无情地浇打着刘小和的眼睛，浇湿了刘小和的衣裤。风放肆地刮着，卷起巨浪向船头冲打。刘小和，老船家，老邓父子，四个人谁也没有再说一句话，默默地划着、划着……
    深夜一点多钟，船划进了工地附近的武丰闸码头，靠岸抛了锚。老船家用手抹了抹前额的雨水和汗水，拿了个大木瓢走到前舱。他一瓢一瓢地向外舀着前舱里的水，一边白了刘小和一眼，怨声怨气地说：
    “驾了一辈子的船，也没碰见过你这样个蹩性子。下次你就别想再雇我的船送菜了。走吧，快去找人起菜吧。”
    刘小和没有答理他，跳上岸径自向工地去了。这时，他才觉得四肢酸困，又倦又饿，浑身淋得像个落汤鸡。他还是一大早吃的饭呢。
    风渐渐住了。刘小和想到明天一清早，这一万多斤鲜嫩的蔬菜，将摆到工地菜市场的枱架上时，禁不住抿着宽宽的嘴巴笑了。
