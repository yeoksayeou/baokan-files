Several problems are currently emerging in the public catering industry in many regions, with the situation being even more severe in major and medium-sized cities and emerging industrial and mining areas. In Beijing, the sales revenue of the catering industry in August 1956 increased by nearly 60% compared to January, while the number of employees and equipment did not increase. Customers often have to queue for meals during meal times. In the future, the urban population and the number of employed people will continue to increase, and new industrial and mining areas will continue to emerge. How can we solve the problem of insufficient catering supply? This involves issues such as the supply policy of the catering industry, price control, training of chefs, and service quality.

According to the availability of raw materials, we should try our best to meet the normal needs of consumers, strive to ensure that customers can get food when they want to eat, and ensure customer satisfaction. This is the guiding principle that the catering industry should adhere to. Currently, some regions are experiencing a shortage of grain, meat, and oil supply. In these areas, in addition to striving for the raw material supply departments to increase the supply as much as possible, the catering industry should also work hard to overcome temporary difficulties. In this situation, the catering industry in various regions must actively promote commodities that the state needs to promote, such as selling more eggs when there are more eggs and selling more vegetables when there are more vegetables. In short, we must use all possible raw materials and adopt flexible supply methods to supply the masses. When raw materials are indeed in short supply and cannot meet the normal requirements of the masses, we should fully explain the situation to customers. On the other hand, the raw material supply departments should also consider that the catering industry is essential for the broad masses of people and should, as far as possible without affecting the quantitative supply of residents, meet the requirements of the catering industry, especially providing some consideration for emerging industrial and mining areas.

In the catering industry, a natural price and profit have been formed over the years, which is generally recognized by the local people. Currently, some people believe that since the catering industry is in short supply, the price of meals should be increased to reduce the number of people eating, thereby balancing supply and demand. This is obviously wrong because doing so would increase the burden on the broad masses of consumers. In some areas, the catering industry unilaterally reduces the selling price of meals while ignoring economic accounting, resulting in an increase in the number of people eating, with the raw materials not correspondingly increasing, making it more difficult for some people who must eat in restaurants, and a few enterprises have even suffered losses as a result.

Therefore, in terms of price control, except for individual unreasonable prices that should be adjusted, the original price level should generally be maintained, and a policy of high quality and high price, and differentiated pricing, should be implemented so that the catering industry can continuously expand reproduction.

China's catering industry has rich techniques and a wide variety of dishes. This is our precious national heritage. In the past, due to insufficient supply of raw materials, coupled with the fact that some areas did not pay enough attention to the characteristics of the catering industry during the transformation of the catering industry, many good special flavors were lost. Over the past year, with the attention of the leadership and the requirements of the masses, many measures have been taken, such as: restoring the original enterprises, original names, and original varieties, trying to solve the supply of raw materials, holding catering industry exhibitions, establishing technical research groups, and compiling cookbooks, so that most of the techniques that had been interrupted have been restored. The current problem is to summarize past experiences and constantly overcome the phenomenon of poor product quality and shoddy workmanship.

It should be said that the catering industry has improved a lot in terms of supply methods and service attitude compared to the early days of the whole industry's joint operation. The phenomenon of queuing to buy tickets and assigning tables for meals has basically disappeared. However, due to the surge in the number of people eating and the excessive fatigue of the catering industry service personnel, there are still many phenomena of not patiently explaining to customers or not taking good care of them, which should be quickly corrected.

The current situation of chefs in the country is that there are few in number, they are old, and there are no successors. In Tianjin, the city's catering industry has more than 18,000 employees, and it is said that there are only seven all-around chefs. This is mainly because the society despises the chef's profession. At the same time, the wages of chefs are generally low, and there is a tendency toward egalitarianism, so many people are unwilling to learn this craft. In order to vigorously train chefs, maintain and promote national heritage, and meet the needs of the broad masses of urban people, the leading departments of the catering industry in various regions should first attach importance to improving the political status of chefs in many ways and criticize the view of despising chefs. Secondly, the wages of chefs should be reasonably adjusted according to the State Council's regulations on the wages of joint state-private enterprises to encourage their work enthusiasm and creativity. In addition, there should also be ways to train chefs. Tianjin has gained preliminary experience in this regard. Their first method is to open training classes by industry, with famous chefs in the industry serving as teachers, and the students are mostly chefs with lower skills or assistants who have been working for many years in the industry (a total of 541 people). They attend classes for half a day (lecture notes are given) and return to the store for operation for half a day, so the technology improves quickly. At present, 435 people have graduated from the training class. The second is the master-apprentice system. Generally, a master takes one or two apprentices, and both parties must sign a contract to ensure teaching and learning. In this way, apprentices with a little experience can learn in one year. The third is to send skilled masters to organize visiting groups to study production techniques in other places. Chefs in Tianjin have learned a lot of techniques in Hangzhou.

Some collective canteens are poorly managed, and the prices of dishes are not low, and the quality is not strong. Therefore, the chef's technical and management level of collective canteens must be improved to better meet the needs of people who eat collectively. Chefs with technical skills in collective canteens should also, like street restaurants, regard taking apprentices as a task, set up training plans, and complete them on schedule, so that the chefs of collective canteens are self-sufficient and do not recruit chefs from the society.

    公共饮食业当前的几个问题
    戴冀农
    很多地区的公共饮食业，目前都出现供不应求的情况，在各大、中城市和新兴工矿区情况更严重。北京市1956年8月份饮食业的卖钱额比1月份增加了将近60％，而营业人员和设备却没有增加。顾客在吃饭时间排队等饭是经常的现象。今后城市人口和就业人数还要继续增加，新的工矿区还要陆续出现，如何解决饮食供不应求的问题呢？这涉及到饮食业的供应方针、价格掌握、培养厨师以及服务质量等问题。
    根据原料供应的可能，尽量满足消费者的正常需要，争取做到顾客想吃饭时能吃到饭，并且使顾客满意，这是饮食业供应应该掌握的方针。目前有些地区，粮、肉、油的供应显得紧张，这种地区的饮食业，除了争取原料供应部门尽可能增加一些供应而外，还应该努力克服暂时的困难。在这种情况下，各地饮食业必须积极推销国家需要推销的商品，如鸡蛋多时多销鸡蛋，蔬菜多时多销蔬菜。总之要利用各种可能的原料，采取灵活的供应办法供应群众。在原料确有困难，不能满足群众正常的要求的时候，应该向顾客充分说清道理。另一方面，原料供应部门也应该考虑到饮食业是广大群众所必需的，应该在不影响居民定量供应的情况下，尽可能满足饮食业的要求，特别是对新兴工矿区要有一定的照顾。
    在饮食业中，若干年来形成了一种自然的价格和利润，它是为当地群众所公认的。当前有些人认为饮食业既然供不应求了，便应当提高饭菜价格，以压缩吃饭的人数，从而平衡供求关系。这显然是错误的。因为这样做会加重广大消费者的负担。也有些地区的饮食业片面减低饭菜的出售价格而忽视了经济核算，结果是吃饭的人数增加了，原料不能相应地增多，使得某些必须在饭馆吃饭的人更加困难了，少数企业还因此发生了亏累。
    因此，在价格掌握方面，除个别不合理的应当调整外，在一般情况下都应当维持原有价格水平，实行优质优价，分等论价的政策，使饮食业能够不断扩大再生产。
    我国饮食业技术丰富，饭菜品种繁多。这是我国宝贵的民族遗产。过去一个时期由于原料供应不足，再加上一部分地区在对饮食业实行改造中照顾经营特点不够，许多好的特种风味丧失了，一年来经过领导部门的注意和群众的要求，已经采取了许多措施，如：恢复原企业、原字号、原品种，设法解决原料供应，召开饮食业展览会，设立技术研究组，编制食谱等，使已经中断的技术大部得到恢复。现在的问题是要总结过去的经验，不断克服产品质量低劣和偷工减料的现象。
    饮食业在供应方法和服务态度方面应该说比全行业合营初期已经改进了不少，排队买牌、派桌吃饭的现象基本上绝迹了。但由于吃饭的人数激增和饮食业服务人员过度疲劳的结果，对顾客不耐心解释或照顾不周的现象还是不少的，这都应该迅速改正。
    现在全国厨师的情况是数量少、年岁大、后继无人。天津市全市饮食业共有从业人员一万八千多人，据说全能厨师不过七人。这主要是因为社会上轻视厨师职业，同时厨师的工资一般偏低和存在着平均主义倾向，因而很多人不愿学这一门手艺。为了大力培养厨师，保持和发扬民族遗产和满足城市广大群众的需要，各地饮食业的领导部门首先应该重视从多方面提高厨师的政治地位，批判轻视厨师的看法。其次，应该根据国务院关于公私合营工资的规定合理地调整厨师的工资，以鼓励他们的工作积极性和创造性。此外还应该有培养厨师的办法。天津市在这方面已经取得了初步经验。他们的第一个办法是分行业开训练班，请本行名厨师担任教师，学员则多是本行内技术较低的厨师或从业多年的助手（共五百四十一人），半天上课（发给讲义），半天回店操作，这样提高技术很快。目前已有四百三十五人在训练班结业。第二是师傅带徒弟。一般的一个师傅带一两个徒弟，双方要签订保教保学合同。这样对稍有经验的学徒来说，一年即可学成。第三是派有技术的师傅，组织参观团到外地学习制作技术。天津的厨师在杭州就学了不少技术回来。
    有些集体食堂管理不善，菜价不小，质量不强。因此，必须提高集体食堂的厨师技术和管理水平，才能更好地满足集体吃饭的人的需要。集体食堂有技术的厨师，也应该和街道饭馆一样，把带徒弟当作一种任务，定出训练计划并且按期完成，作到集体食堂的厨师自给自足，不向社会上招收厨师。
