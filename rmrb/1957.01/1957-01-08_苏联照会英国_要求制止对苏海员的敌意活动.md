Xinhua News Agency, London, January 6th: TASS reported that the Soviet Embassy in Britain delivered a note to the British Foreign Office on January 3rd, demanding that British authorities take measures to stop a group of anti-Soviet elements from engaging in hostile activities against Soviet sailors.

The note pointed out that a group of unidentified people claiming to belong to the "NTS" organization have been continuously carrying out hostile activities against Soviet sailors on Soviet ships berthed in British ports, including distributing anti-Soviet leaflets in Russian, harassing Soviet sailors, and making provocative questions and sinister suggestions to them. The note cited several recent examples.

The note stated that the Soviet Embassy in Britain has repeatedly urged the British Foreign Office to pay attention to the anti-Soviet activities carried out by the "NTS" organization within British territory, but this organization is still continuing such activities up to now. The British authorities are clearly aware of this, but remain indifferent.

The note reiterated the demand to stop the activities of this organization, and pointed out that the organization's sinister activities hinder the development of trade and trade navigation between Britain and the Soviet Union, and obstruct normal relations between the two countries.

    苏联照会英国
    要求制止对苏海员的敌意活动
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社伦敦6日讯：苏联驻英国大使馆3日递交给英国外交部一份照会，要求英国当局采取措施，制止一批反苏分子对苏联海员进行敌意活动。
    照会指出，一批自称属于“NTS”组织的来历不明的人对停泊在英国港口的苏联船只上的苏联海员连续地进行敌意的活动，包括散发俄文的反苏传单，纠缠苏联海员们，向他们提出挑拨性的问题和罪恶的建议。照会举出了好几件最近的事例。
    照会说，苏联驻英国大使馆曾经多次促请英国外交部注意“NTS”组织在英国境内所进行的敌视苏联的活动，但是这个组织直到现在仍在继续这种活动。英国当局明知道也不闻不问。
    照会再次要求制止这个组织的活动，并且指出，这个组织的罪恶活动妨碍了英苏两国之间的贸易和贸易通航的发展，妨碍了两国的正常关系。
