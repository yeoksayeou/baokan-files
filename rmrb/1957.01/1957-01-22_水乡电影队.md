In the wide expanse of Hongze Lake, stretching over 150 *li*, more than 40,000 fishermen live scattered around. Before liberation, the fishermen lived a life of constant hunger, cold, and a lack of education. In July of last year, Hongze County established a film projection team. Since then, the fishermen have had the opportunity to see movies.

This film projection team has four projectionists, who appear day and night on the boundless Hongze Lake.

One morning, Sun Xianzheng, the leader of the film projection team, and his team members went to the lake to screen films for the fishermen for the first time. To travel from Gule in the northeast of Hongze Lake to Mudun in the northwest, they needed to cross 80 *li* of the lake. When the boat sailed two or thirty *li* from the shore, dark clouds filled the sky, and the wind direction suddenly changed. The water in the lake was deep, and the waves were high. The small wooden boat was in a very dangerous situation, facing the wind and against the current. At this time, Sun Xianzheng, a 22-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, thought of how many fishermen were waiting for them to show the films. He mustered his courage and bravely stood out from the cabin, encouraging the team members to overcome the headwind and help the boatmen pole. The four enthusiastic and courageous projectionists immediately turned into sailors. The small wooden boat finally moved forward. When they were still two *li* away from their destination, unfortunately, they encountered a burst of wind and rain. It was already dark, and everyone was exhausted. They had to stop the boat to rest for the night. No one slept that night, and they used their clothes to protect the equipment. The next morning, when the fishermen learned that the projection team had arrived, they were very moved.

That evening, the small, remote beach was filled with the laughter of the fishermen. More than six hundred fishermen, who had worked hard all day, sat on the bows of their boats along the beach with their families. This was the first time in their lives that they had seen a movie.

The Hongze County First Projection Team also uses slides to show new people and new events, introducing production experience and weather forecasts to the fishermen. Recently, they plan to use the screen to teach literacy and eliminate illiteracy among the fishermen. Now, the projectionists have established a deep friendship with the fishermen. The projection team is welcomed by the fishermen everywhere. If the projection team doesn't go to the lake for a few days, the fishermen miss them very much. In the past four months, the projection team has made fifteen film screenings specifically for the fishermen.

    水乡电影队
    新华社记者　朱冰菊
    在一百五十多华里宽阔的洪泽湖中，散居着四万多渔民。解放前，渔民们整天在湖里过着吃不饱，穿不暖，没有文化的生活。去年7月，洪泽县成立了电影放映队。渔民们从此就有机会看到电影了。
    这个电影放映队有四个放映员，他们不分白天黑夜，出没在一望无边的洪泽湖上。
    有一天早晨，电影放映队的队长孙宪政和队员们第一次到湖上为渔民放映电影。从洪泽湖东北边上的古勒到西北边上的木墩去放映，需要穿过八十华里的湖面。当船驶出离湖边二、三十里时，满天起了乌云，风向突然变了。湖中水深浪大。小木船处在顶风逆水中，处境非常危险。这时，二十二岁的青年团员孙宪政想到了多少渔民在等他们去放电影，于是，他鼓起勇气，勇敢地站出船舱。鼓励小队同志战胜顶风逆流，帮助船工撑篙。四个热情勇敢的放映员马上变成了水手。小木船终于前进了。在到达目的地还有二里路时，不巧，又遇到一阵狂风暴雨。这时天已经黑了，大家都精疲力尽。只好停下船来歇夜。这一夜大家都没有睡，用自己的衣服保护了机器。第二天清早当渔民们知道放映队来到时，非常感动。
    就在这一天的旁晚，在这偏僻的小滩上到处洋溢着渔民们的欢笑声。辛勤劳动了一天的六百多个渔民带着自己的亲人，沿着水滩坐在船头上。这是他们有生以来第一次看电影。
    洪泽县第一放映队还利用幻灯片放映新人新事，向渔民们介绍生产经验和预报天气。最近他们打算利用银幕识字为渔民扫除文盲。现在放映员已和渔民建立了深厚的友谊。放映队到处受到渔民的欢迎。放映队几天不到湖上去，渔民就非常思念他们。四个月来放映队到湖上去专门为渔民放映了十五场电影。
