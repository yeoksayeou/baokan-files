Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd—Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have decided to buy less meat and fewer New Year goods during the Spring Festival in order to prioritize meeting the needs of the people.

    The directly subordinate organs of the PLA Air Defense Force stationed in Beijing have returned all 2,000 catties of pork that the food company was increasing the supply of during the Spring Festival. They will also reduce the daily pork supply by half for the ten days from January 25th to February 4th. The Air Force Logistics Department of the troops stationed in the Wuhan area has instructed its subordinate units that officers will not buy any meat for five days before and after the Spring Festival, and should buy as few New Year goods as possible, and have returned 1,600 catties of meat coupons to the food company. The troops stationed in Kunming have voluntarily given all the meat supplied to officers and part of the meat supplied to soldiers during the Spring Festival to the citizens, and requested a reduction in the amount of meat supplied to the troops in the future.
