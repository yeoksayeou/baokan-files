    Seriously Treat Letters from the Masses
    Sun Zhiming

    With the increasing social awareness of the masses, the number of letters from the masses is constantly increasing. According to statistics from the supervisory committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province, the number of letters in the last five months of 1956 increased by about double compared to the same period in 1955. The increase in letters from the masses is a manifestation of their growing trust in the Party and the country. Therefore, we must treat these letters with utmost seriousness.

    However, some Party leadership organs, and even Party supervisory committees, still exhibit a lack of seriousness and responsibility in handling letters from the masses. This deserves attention. From the perspective of Heilongjiang Province, there are the following problems:

    First, some organs simply copy and forward letters. It is permissible to forward letters from the masses to relevant units for handling. However, after forwarding the letters, these units should be urged to handle them promptly, and guidance should be provided during the handling process. However, some organs do not do this. They believe that their responsibility is fulfilled after forwarding the letters, which is an irresponsible attitude. A municipal supervisory committee received a letter from the masses accusing the Party secretary and factory director of a factory of violating laws and regulations. They forwarded it to the factory's supervisory committee for handling. The factory supervisory committee felt it was difficult to handle and requested the superior supervisory committee to send someone to assist. However, the municipal supervisory committee criticized the factory supervisory committee for "not daring to adhere to the principle of struggle" and forwarded the letter back, resulting in the letter being piled up in the factory's supervisory committee.

    Second, some organs lack a spirit of serious research when handling letters, resulting in incorrect handling and delayed resolution. For example, when the Bayan County Supervisory Committee in Heilongjiang Province handled the case of the Shanqian Village Party branch secretary losing his stand and protecting rich peasants, although they went down for investigation five times, they often went down in the morning and returned in the afternoon to draw conclusions. As a result, the problem became more and more complicated. They originally intended to solve the problem in a very short time, but it took three years to close the case. Failure to handle letters responsibly will not only delay time but also lead to mistakes and unclear right and wrong. This is something we must be highly vigilant about.

    Third, there is a lack of principled spirit in handling letters, and a reluctance to boldly fight against bad people and bad deeds. More seriously, some units even adopt the method of turning major issues into minor issues, and minor issues into no issues, in order to protect the accused and cover up their wrongdoings. The county Party secretary of Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang, violated personnel regulations and privately arranged a job for his sister. This was originally not a very serious mistake, but after the masses exposed it, the provincial supervisory committee asked the county committee to handle the matter. The county committee then shielded the county Party secretary, saying that it was not he himself who advocated that the organization department introduce her to work. When the provincial supervisory committee conducted an in-depth investigation, they reluctantly admitted the matter, but still pushed the responsibility to the organization department, without mentioning what responsibility the county Party secretary should bear. This phenomenon is not isolated in Heilongjiang.

    To change the above situation and give full play to the role of letters from the people, the key issue lies in the importance attached by the Party committees at all levels and their ability to correctly treat these letters.

    Leaders of Party organizations at all levels and responsible persons of state organs, factories, and enterprises should strengthen leadership over this work, regularly discuss and inspect this work, and frequently help to solve existing problems in the work in a timely manner. Important letters should be personally reviewed, carefully studied, and specifically handled. For important cases involving major leading cadres and cases of a political and policy nature, forces should be organized to conduct inspection and handling, and guidance should be provided.

    A series of working systems such as registration, review, forwarding, and file storage must be established for handling letters and visits, and the phenomenon of chaotic procedures and even loss of people's letters must be effectively overcome. If there is a loss, responsibility must be investigated. For cases that require results to be handled by lower levels, a monthly or quarterly follow-up system must be established.

    The results of handling letters must be carefully reviewed. For cases that require disciplinary action, they must be handled in accordance with the spirit of the Party Constitution adopted by the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the spirit of the state organs' methods of reward and punishment for cadres, and the handling results must be notified to the letter writer by the handling organ.

    严肃地对待群众来信
    孙志明
    随着群众社会觉悟的提高，群众来信不断增加。据黑龙江省各级监察委员会1956年后5个月统计，来信比1955年同一时期增加一倍左右。群众来信增多，这是他们对党和国家信任不断增长的表现，因此，我们必须十分严肃地对待这些来信。
    但是有些党的领导机关，甚至党的监察委员会，在处理群众来信时还存在着不够认真负责的现象，这是值得注意的。从黑龙江省的情况来看，有这样一些问题：
    一、有些机关对来信只是照抄照转。将群众来信转给有关单位处理，这是可以的。但把信转去后，应该督促这些单位及时处理，并在处理过程中进行指导。可是有些机关不是这样，他们以为把信转出去后，自己的责任就尽了，这是不负责任的表现。有一个市监察委员收到群众一封控告一个工厂党委书记兼厂长违法乱纪的信件，他们就转给这个厂的监委会去处理，工厂监委会感到处理有困难，请求上级监委会派人帮助处理，而这个市监委会却批评厂监委会“不敢坚持原则斗争”，又把信转回去，结果这封信就在这个厂的监委会中积压下来了。
    二、有些机关在处理来信时，缺乏认真研究的精神，结果得不到正确的处理，拖延了解决的时间。如黑龙江省巴彦县监委会在处理山前村党支部书记丧失立场，包庇富农案件时，他们虽然下去调查过五次，但往往是午前下去，午后回来就下结论。这样问题就愈搞愈复杂，他们本来企图在很短时间内就解决问题，结果拖了三年才结案。不认真负责处理来信，不但会拖延时间，而且更会把事情弄错，是非不明，这是不能不十分警惕的。
    三、处理来信时缺乏原则精神，不敢大胆向坏人坏事作斗争。更严重的是有些单位为了庇护被检举人，竟采取将大事化小事，小事化无事的办法，来掩盖被检举人的错误事实。黑龙江尚志县县委书记违反人事制度，私自安插自己妹妹的工作，这本来是一件不算太严重的错误，但当群众揭发后，省监委会要求县委会处理这件事，县委会即包庇这个县委书记，说并不是他本人主张让组织部介绍她工作的。当省监委会深入追查时，他们才吞吞吐吐承认了这件事，但仍然把责任推给组织部，而县委书记应负什么责任则只字未提。这种现象，在黑龙江来说并非是个别的。
    改变上列情况，充分发挥人民群众来信的作用，关键问题在于各级党委领导的重视并且能正确地对待这些来信。
    各级党的组织和各级国家机关、工厂、企业的负责人应加强对这项工作的领导，定期讨论和检查这项工作，经常帮助及时解决工作中存在的问题。重要的来信要亲自过目，认真研究，具体批办。对牵涉到主要领导干部案件以及带有政治性、政策性的重要案件，应组织力量进行检查处理，并加以指导。
    受理来信来访必须建立登记、审阅、转办、档案保管等一系列的工作制度，切实地克服手续混乱、甚至丢失人民来信的现象。如有丢失，必须追查责任。凡经下级处理要结果的案件，须建立月或季催办制度。
    对来信处理结果要认真的审查，凡须给以纪律处分的案件，必须按照党的第八次全国代表大会通过的党章的规定精神和国家机关对干部的奖惩办法的精神予以处理，并且由承办机关将处理结果通知来信者。
