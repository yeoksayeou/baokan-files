    Helping Production Departments Solve Technical Problems
    Hebei Science and Technology Association Actively Carries Out Academic Research

    (Our dispatch) Since its establishment in June 1956, the Hebei Branch of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies has carried out a great deal of work. At present, the province's academic organizations have developed greatly, and the academic activities of scientific workers have gradually become more active.

    In the past six months, the Hebei Province has established 34 branch societies and branch preparatory committees, and each society has also developed many members. According to the statistics of 18 societies including the Shijiazhuang Textile Engineering Society, the Tangshan Medical Association, and the Baoding Medical Association on January 8 alone, they have a total of 723 formal members. The establishment of these societies has united the vast number of scientific workers in Hebei Province to carry out a variety of academic activities. According to the statistics of nine branch societies in Baoding alone, a total of 22 academic report meetings were held in November and December 1956, and 59 people went to Beijing to participate in 23 academic report meetings. The Baoding Chinese Medicine Society Preparatory Committee has developed 63 members in the two months since its establishment on October 13, 1956, held three academic report meetings, and published eight academic papers. These academic activities have played a significant role in promoting scientific research, developing and consolidating the cultural heritage of the motherland, and helping production departments solve technical problems in production. The waterwheels produced by the local industrial production units in Tangshan City were originally of very low quality, with a reject rate of 40% to 50%. Later, the Tangshan Mechanical Engineering Society organized members to visit and put forward many improvement suggestions. Thanks to their help, the quality of the waterwheels has been greatly improved, and the reject rate has been reduced to 8%.

    This year, Hebei Province's academic activities will have greater development. The Hebei Science and Technology Association plans to prepare for the establishment of 25 societies in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Handan, Qinhuangdao, and Chengde this year, and further carry out academic activities in accordance with the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy.

    帮助生产部门解决技术问题
    河北科联积极开展学术研究
    本报讯　中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会河北省分会，自从1956年6月成立以来，进行了许多工作。目前，全省学会组织已经有了很大的发展，科学工作者的学术活动也已逐渐活跃起来。
    半年来，河北省各地已经建立的学会分会和分会筹委会已达三十四个，各学会也发展了许多会员。仅据1月8日石家庄纺织工程学会、唐山医学会、保定医学会等十八个学会的统计，它们共有正式会员七百二十三人。这些学会的成立，团结河北省广大的科学工作者开展了多种多样的学术活动。仅就保定九个学会分会的统计，1956年11、12两月举办的学术报告会共有二十二次，还有五十九人到北京参加了二十三次学术报告会。保定中医学会筹委会于1956年10月13日成立以来的两个多月当中，发展了六十三名会员，共举行了三次学术报告会，发表了八篇学术论文。这些学术活动，在推动科学研究、发扬整理祖国文化遗产以及帮助生产部门解决生产中的技术问题等方面，起了重大作用。唐山市地方工业生产单位原来生产的水车质量很低，废品率达到40％到50％；后来唐山市机械工程学会组织会员前去参观，提出了许多改进意见。由于他们的帮助，水车的质量有了很大提高，废品率降低到8％。
    今年，河北省学术活动将有更大的发展。河北科联计划今年在保定、石家庄、唐山、张家口、邯郸、秦皇岛和承德等地筹建二十五个学会，并且根据“百家争鸣”的方针，进一步开展学术活动。（希　令）
