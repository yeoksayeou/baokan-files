Nationwide Implementation of Pest and Disease Forecasting
Plant Pest and Disease Control Shifts from Passive to Active

This newspaper reports that agricultural pest and disease forecasting has been universally implemented across the country (except for Tibet) since last year. Pest and disease forecasting organizations, from Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan Island in the south, from Xinjiang in the west to the coastal provinces in the east, regularly report on the occurrence and development of plant pests and diseases, helping farmers and farms in various regions to prevent and control plant pests and diseases effectively and in a timely manner. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture convened pest and disease forecasting personnel from several provinces and regions to summarize their experiences in carrying out this work, studied opinions on improving forecasting work in 1957, and entrusted the North China, East China, Central China, Northeast, and Northwest Agricultural Science Institutes, as well as the Hebei Province Shalingzi Agricultural Experiment Station, to separately summarize pest and disease forecasting techniques and propose forecasting methods for 1957.

The content of forecasting work is: based on the study of the biological characteristics and occurrence patterns of pathogens and pests, systematically observe the growth trends of pests and diseases, and in conjunction with climate, soil, crop cultivation systems, and other conditions, issue forecasts in advance regarding the possible timing, quantity, and development trends of pests and diseases, so that people can prevent and control them early.

In recent years, forecasting has been conducted for a few pests and diseases in certain areas. It was not until 1956, on the basis of agricultural cooperativization, that a series of forecasting organizations were established from top to bottom, conducting large-scale forecasting for rice stem borers, locusts, armyworms, wheat midges, corn borers, cotton aphids, cotton bollworms, rice blast, potato late blight, and other pests and diseases. The work of the past year has proven that the pest and disease control work in many areas has shifted from a passive and rushed situation to a proactive and timely one, saving a great deal of manpower and material resources, and improving the effectiveness of control. For example, forecasting stations in rice-growing areas can generally forecast the peak occurrence period of rice stem borers ten days in advance, providing timely guidance for control. The Shaoyang Station in Hunan predicted on June 14th of last year that the initial appearance of the second-generation rice stem borer would be in late June, and as a result, the Shaoyang Special Zone indeed saw the initial appearance of the rice stem borer from June 21st to 29th. The wheat midge hatches, mates, and lays eggs on the same day, so the window of opportunity for control is extremely short. Therefore, effective control must rely on accurate forecasting. Last year, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Anhui, Sichuan, and other provinces effectively controlled wheat midges on more than ten million mu of wheat fields, ensuring a bumper wheat harvest. Accurate forecasting played a significant role. Therefore, people praise the forecasting organizations as "scouts of the fields" and "eyes for pest control."

    全国普遍开展病虫害预测预报工作
    农作物病虫害防治工作由被动转入主动
    本报讯　全国各地（除西藏外）从去年普遍开展了农作物病虫害预测预报工作。北至黑龙江、南至海南岛、西至新疆、东至沿海各省的病虫害预测预报组织，经常向人们报告病虫害的发生、发展情况，帮助各地农民和农场及时有效地防治了农作物病虫害。最近，农业部召集一些省区的预测预报工作人员总结开展这项工作的经验，研究了1957年改进预测预报工作的意见，并且委托华北、华东、华中、东北、西北等农业科学研究所和河北省沙岭子农业试验站，分别总结病虫害的预测预报技术，拟出1957年的预测预报办法。
    预测预报工作的内容是：根据对病菌和害虫的生物学特性和发生的规律的研究，系统地观察病虫害的生长趋势，结合气候、土壤、农作物栽培制度等条件，对病虫害可能发生的时期、数量和发展趋势事先发出预报，使人们及早防治。
    最近几年来，曾在部分地区对少数病虫害进行了预测预报。直到1956年，在农业合作化的基础上，才由上而下地建立了一系列的预测预报组织，大规模地对稻螟、飞蝗、粘虫、小麦吸浆虫、玉米螟、棉蚜、棉红铃虫、稻瘟病、马铃薯晚疫病等多种病虫害进行了预测预报。一年来的工作证明：不少地区的病虫防治工作已经由被动、突击的局面转变为主动、及时，节省了大量的人力、物力，提高了防治的效果。例如稻区的预测预报站大都能在十天以前预报水稻螟蛾的盛发时期，及时指导防治。湖南邵阳站在去年6月14日预报第二代二化螟的初见期在6月下旬，结果邵阳专区在6月21日至29日果然初见二化螟。小麦吸浆虫是当天羽化，当天就会交配产卵的，防治的有利时机极短，因此有效的防治必须依靠精确的预测预报。去年河南、陕西、甘肃、安徽、四川等省有效地防治了一千多万亩麦地上的吸浆虫，保障了小麦的丰收，精确的预测预报工作就起了很大的作用。所以人们都称赞预测预报组织是“田野的侦察兵”，是“治虫的眼睛”。
