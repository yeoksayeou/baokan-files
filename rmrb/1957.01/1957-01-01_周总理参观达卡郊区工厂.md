Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 29th – Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long were given an exceptionally warm welcome along the fifteen-mile route today, when they travelled by car and boat to visit two factories in the suburbs of Dhaka.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long travelled on the Sitalakhya River from Narayanganj city to visit a jute mill and a cotton mill. On the ten-mile road from Dhaka to Narayanganj city, several decorated archways were erected and large banners were hung. As the guests passed by in their cars, people waved and applauded in groups here and there. Many farmhouses under the coconut trees along the way also hung small flags to show their welcome.

Most of the residents of Narayanganj city flocked to the main street through which the Chinese guests passed on their way to the dock. The jubilant crowd packed the street tightly. When they saw Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long passing by, accompanied by Prime Minister Suhrawardy and Chief Minister of East Pakistan, Ataur Rahman, they enthusiastically shouted "Pakistan, China are brothers!" (Ba-Zhong People are brothers).

When the Chinese guests arrived at the dock to board the boat, people wearing blue, red, pink and white clothes cheered loudly. The densely packed crowd filled the riverbank, and hundreds more climbed onto railings, utility poles, and rooftops. The decks of sampans and the roofs of double-decked passenger ships in the river were also packed with people. The scene of welcoming the Chinese guests was exciting and unforgettable.

The Chinese guests sailed five miles upstream, through the world's most famous jute producing area, to the jute and textile factories. There, all the docks and ships moored in the river were also crowded with cheering people, many standing on top of the piles of raw jute on the boats. Factories on both sides of the river were decorated with flags. Thousands of workers stood on the docks shouting welcome and friendly slogans. Joyful children on both banks ran after the boat.

When the Chinese Premier arrived at the jute factory on the riverside, the workers presented them with garlands. They rode in jeeps through the various departments of this factory, which was built in 1952. They then came out of the factory and returned to the dock, with thousands of workers who were not on duty running behind the jeeps. As the boat sailed to the cotton factory, they waved goodbye to the Premier warmly.

The workers and staff of the cotton mill, half a mile away, held a similarly grand welcome ceremony. The factory management presented the guests with jute tote bags and linen cloth.

Premier Zhou Enlai will deliver a speech to the general public at the stadium, visit the university, and attend a banquet hosted by the Chief Minister this afternoon.

    周总理参观达卡郊区工厂
    新华社达卡29日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理今天上午在乘汽车和游船去参观达卡郊区的两个工厂的时候，沿路十五英里受到了人们异常热烈的欢迎。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在锡塔拉基河上的纳拉扬甘吉城乘游船前往黄麻厂和棉纺厂。从达卡到纳拉扬甘吉城十英里的路上，搭着好些牌楼，挂着大幅标语。当客人们乘车经过的时候，人们这里一群、那里一群地招手和鼓掌。沿途椰子树下的许多农家还挂着小旗表示欢迎。
    纳拉扬甘吉城的大部分居民都涌到了中国客人乘车到码头去所经过的大街上。兴高采烈的人群把这条大街挤得水泄不通，他们看到周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在苏拉瓦底总理和东巴基斯坦首席部长阿陶尔·拉赫曼陪同下经过的时候，热烈高呼“巴基斯坦、秦巴依巴依”（巴中人民是兄弟）。
    在中国客人们到达码头要登上游船的时候，穿着蓝色、红色、粉红色和白色衣服的人高声欢呼，密密层层的人群挤满了河边，还有数以百计的人爬上了栏杆、电线杆和屋顶。在河里的舢板的舱板和双层客舱的船顶上也挤满了人。对中国客人的欢迎情景令人激动难忘。
    中国客人乘船经过世界上最著名的黄麻产区向上游行驶了五英里到达黄麻和纺织工厂。在那里，所有的码头和停泊在河里的船舶上也挤满了欢呼的人群，许多人站在游船上堆得高高的生黄麻上。河岸两旁的工厂都挂着旗帜。成千的工人站在码头上高呼欢迎和友好的口号。两岸的兴高采烈的儿童追着游船奔跑。
    中国总理到达河边的黄麻工厂时，工人们给他们戴上了花环。他们乘着吉普车穿过这个1952年建成的工厂的各个部门。他们又从工厂出来返回码头，数以千计的未上班的工人跟在吉普车后面跑。当游船驶往棉花工厂去的时候，他们热情地挥手向总理告别。
    在半英里以外的棉纺厂的工人和职员举行了同样盛大的欢迎会。厂方管理人员赠给客人们麻手提包和麻布。
    周恩来总理今天下午将在体育场向广大群众发表演说、参观大学和出席首席部长的宴会。
