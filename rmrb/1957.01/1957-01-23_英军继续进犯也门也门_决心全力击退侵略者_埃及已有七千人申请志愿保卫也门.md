　　Abu Taleb stated to reporters that British troops have reached 25 miles inside Yemen from the border, almost completely destroying the border city of Harib. He emphasized that Yemen is determined to repel British aggression with all its strength.

　　He said that Britain has violated its agreements with Yemen and taken aggressive actions. However, Yemen is determined to defend its rights under the treaty signed in 1934 and the agreement concluded in 1951, and Britain should bear full responsibility for violating the treaty and the agreement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: London dispatch: The British government, which is using modern armed forces to attack Yemen, sent a note to the Chargé d'Affaires of the Yemeni Embassy in the United Kingdom on the 21st, falsely accusing Yemen of "attacking" the British Aden Protectorate, and lodging a "strong protest" against Yemen. The note stated that Britain intends to continue its aggressive actions against Yemen. It said that Britain would so-called "continue to assist" the Aden Protectorate to "resist the Yemeni offensive."

　　The Yemeni Embassy in the United Kingdom has long solemnly declared: "Yemen has not committed any aggression against the so-called Aden Protectorate." It has also repeatedly pointed out that it is Britain that is using Aden to invade Yemen.

    决心全力击退侵略者
    埃及已有七千人申请志愿保卫也门
    新华社开罗22日电　据报纸消息，也门国王伊马姆·艾哈迈德打电报给也门驻埃及公使阿布·塔列布说，英国军队在继续进行侵略行动。伊马姆·艾哈迈德指示公使把这件事通知阿拉伯联盟秘书处、埃及政府和阿拉伯国家驻开罗的外交使节。
    阿布·塔列布在对记者发表声明时说，英国军队已经到达也门境内离边境二十五英里的地方，差不多完全摧毁了边境城市哈里卜。他强调说，也门决心用自己的一切力量来击退英国的侵略。
    他说，英国违背它同也门签订的协定并且采取了侵略行动。但是也门坚决维护自己根据1934年签订的条约和1951年缔结的协定所具有的权利，破坏条约和协定的全部责任应该由英国承担。
    新华社开罗22日电　据报纸消息，埃及已经有七千人向也门驻开罗使馆提出申请，志愿保卫也门，抵抗英国侵略。
    在亚历山大港，大批青年已经志愿报名。
    自从1月10日起，埃及解放大会青年部开展了一个征募援助也门志愿人员的运动。
    新华社22日讯　伦敦消息：正在使用现代化武装部队进攻也门的英国政府21日照会也门驻英国公使馆代办，反诬也门“进攻”英国的亚丁保护地，并且就此对也门提出“强硬抗议”。照会表示，英国打算继续对也门采取侵略行动。它说，英国要所谓“继续援助”亚丁保护地来“抵抗也门的进攻”。
    也门驻英国公使馆早就严正声明：“也门并没有对所谓亚丁保护地作任何侵犯。”它还一再指出，正是英国利用亚丁向也门进犯。
