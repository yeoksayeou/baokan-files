At a Furniture Factory
By our reporter Lin Gang

Near Dahongmen in the southern suburbs of Beijing, a cluster of red factory buildings is scattered. A railway spur connects from the station, passes through a low fence, and extends to the center of the factory. About a hundred railcars of timber are transported here from the forest areas each month. Then, a constant stream of trucks and large vehicles loaded with various furniture pieces departs from here, heading to every corner of the city.

This is the Beijing Timber Factory. Half of the wooden furniture needed by the city's government offices, military units, enterprises, schools, and citizens is supplied by this factory, which has three thousand employees.

Deputy Director Comrade Lu Xinyuan accompanied us on a tour of the various workshops.

In the first workshop, several electric saws were cutting sections of logs into planks of varying thicknesses. The roar of the motors was deafening. Most of the timber here is transported from the northeast forest regions. In previous years, due to a one-sided understanding of "meeting the needs of the people," the factory had serious waste in the use of timber. They selected the highest quality timber to manufacture furniture. If there was a blemish on the surface of an office desk, it would not be allowed to leave the factory. Valuable Manchurian ash, an excellent industrial material, was being used to make furniture.

"Now, most of the timber we use is second- and third-class material, and some of it is 'sapwood' and 'side cuts' left over from making railway sleepers," said Deputy Director Lu. "Wooden furniture generally does not encounter heavy pressure or severe vibrations. Facts have proven that such timber is equally strong and durable for making furniture."

There was a time when the factory sold leftover timber scraps as firewood, but private merchants bought these "firewood" scraps to manufacture furniture. Now, we see that various scraps and waste materials generated during the timber processing are being used to make various timber substitutes – artificial wood, plywood, wood wool board…

In the artificial board manufacturing workshop, workers mix shavings, sawdust, and small fragments of waste material together, blend them with blood glue, and send them into a hot press. Twenty minutes later, artificial board is produced. After sanding and painting, it is even more beautiful than wood.

An engineer introduced us, saying: "The hardness, bending strength, and other physical and mechanical properties of this artificial board are higher than those of wood, making it suitable for interior installations in buildings and vehicles."

For a long time, the factory's timber utilization rate did not exceed 50%. Half of the timber transported from thousands of miles away was made into furniture, and the other half was wasted. After these several substitutes were put into mass production, the timber utilization rate will be able to reach over 85%.

The design office was very quiet. Designers were drawing designs for various new styles of furniture.

"This is our direction!" said the deputy head of the design department, pointing to a delicate and exquisite small square table. The tabletop of this small square table was made of fiber wood, and the legs were very thin and could be opened and folded. This was a gift brought back by a responsible comrade from East Germany.

The exchange of production technology and experience between fraternal countries played an important role in improving the design of the factory's products. The designers learned a lot from the economic exhibitions held by various countries in Beijing. When the Soviet Union's Exhibition of Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction opened, the "Furniture Pavilion" was the most attractive to the employees of the timber factory. The furniture produced in the Soviet Union was of such excellent quality and so small and exquisite. All the furniture in one bedroom was made of birch plywood, and the wood had very beautiful patterns.

The employees broadened their horizons. The designers' conservative thinking was shaken. In the past, they believed that in order to meet the needs of the people, good materials and large pieces of wood had to be used; otherwise, the quality would be affected. Now, they clearly saw that the timber was wasted, and the designed furniture was bulky and unattractive.

The exhibition's expert, Felatov, was invited to visit the factory. He was a woodworker with more than thirty years of experience and later took on leadership work in the department. After the visit, he frankly offered many suggestions. The first suggestion was: "The furniture you produce is too bulky!" He picked up a chair, weighed it, and said, "I'm worried that some female comrades won't be able to move it." He said that the materials used were also too good. The Soviet Union has abundant forest resources, but furniture production uses secondary materials and substitutes.

Two workers from the Czechoslovakia Ten Years of Socialist Construction Achievements Exhibition visited the factory the year before last. They were also surprised to see that the factory was using high-quality timber to make furniture. They shrugged and said: "In our country, high-quality timber is used in industry and construction."

Since then, the Beijing Timber Factory has continuously saved timber by improving designs, and the cost of general products has been reduced by 20% to 30% over the years.

Although the conservative thinking in the factory has changed, the customers still maintain old concepts, believing that the heavier and more solid wooden furniture is, the better. Some customers even specify what kind of timber they want to use to customize furniture, and some customers design drawings and want the factory to make them according to the drawings. The factory has accommodated customers in these aspects; therefore, the work of improving design is very incomplete.

After studying the documents of the Eighth National Congress, the factory correctly resolved the contradiction between "saving timber for the country" and "meeting the needs of the people." Using the most economical timber to produce solid, practical, and beautiful furniture has become the unanimous belief of all employees in the factory.

Recently, the factory completed the design of a new set of furniture, which saved an average of 21% of timber. We saw samples of this set of furniture in the showroom, which were indeed lighter, more beautiful, and more refined than the furniture made before. Deputy Director Lu moved a dark brown chair and placed it side by side with the light yellow new chair, and introduced us, saying: "This is from the past, weighing twelve pounds; this is the newly designed one, weighing nine pounds." He said: "This chair uses less material, but because of the improvement in design and the improvement of technology, it is more solid than the previously manufactured one."

The factory's leadership recently proposed a struggle goal to all employees in the factory: to save half of the timber this year. This means that if the state allocates only half of the timber to them this year compared to last year, they will still produce the same amount of products as last year.

    在家具制造厂里
    本报记者　林钢
    北京南郊的大红门附近，散散落落地分布着一片红色的厂房。一条铁路专用线从车站接过来，穿过矮矮的围墙，延伸到工厂的中心。每月大约有一百辆车皮的木料，从林区运到这里。然后，川流不息的卡车和大车装载着各式家具，从这里驶向市区的各个角落。
    这是北京市木材厂。全市机关、部队、企业、学校和市民需用的木器家具，有一半是由这个拥有三千职工的工厂供应的。
    副厂长鲁心源同志陪同我们参观了各个车间。
    在第一个车间里，几架电锯将一段段圆木锯成厚薄不等的木板。马达的轰响，震耳欲聋。这儿的木料大部分是从东北林区运来的。前几年，因为片面理解“满足人民需要”，这个工厂在使用木材上有过严重的浪费。他们选用了最上等的木材来制造家具。办公桌桌面上有个栉子，就不让出厂。珍贵的水曲柳，是上好的工业用材，他们却拿来做家具。
    “现在我们用的木料，大部分是二、三等材，此外还有一部分是铁路做枕木用下的‘标皮’和‘边材’。”鲁副厂长说，“木器家具一般不会遇到重压或剧烈震动，事实证明，这样的木料作家具，同样坚固、耐用。”
    曾经有过这样的时候：工厂把零头木料当作劈柴出卖，私商却收购这些“劈柴”去制造家具。现在，我们看到，在木材加工过程中产生的各种碎料、废料，正在被利用来做成各种木材的代用品——人造木、胶合木、木丝板……
    在人造板制造车间里，工人们将刨花、木屑和废料打成的小碎片，搅拌在一起，用血胶混和，送进热压机，二十分钟后，人造板就制成了。经过砂光、油漆以后，比木板还要漂亮。
    一位工程师向我们介绍说：“这种人造板的硬度、抗折强度等物理机械性能，比木板还要高，适宜于做建筑和舟车的内部装置。”
    长期以来，这个工厂的木材利用率不超过50％。从几千里外运来的木料，一半做成了家具，一半就浪费了。这几项代用品大量生产以后，木材利用率将可以达到85％以上。
    设计室里很安静。设计人员正在绘制各种新式家具的设计图样。
    “这是我们的方向！”设计科副科长指着一张玲珑精巧的小方桌说。这张小方桌，桌面是纤维木的，腿儿很细，可以放开，可以合拢。这是一位负责同志从民主德国带回来的礼物。
    兄弟国家之间生产技术经验的交流，对于这个工厂产品设计的改进，起了重要的作用。设计人员从各国在北京举办的经济展览会上，学习到了许多东西。苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕时，最吸引木材厂职工的是“家具馆”。苏联出品的家具，质地那么优良，又是那么小巧玲珑。有一间卧室的全部家具是用白桦树的胶合板做成的，木板上还有非常好看的花纹。
    职工们打开了眼界。设计人员的保守思想动摇了。从前认为，要满足人民需要，必须用好料，用大料，否则，就会影响质量。现在明白地看到，木材浪费了，设计的家具却又笨又不好看。
    展览会的专家费拉托夫被请到工厂来参观。他是个三十多年的木器工人，后来在部里担任领导工作。参观以后，他坦率地提出了许多意见。第一条意见就是：“你们生产的家具太笨重了！”他拿起一张椅子，掂了一掂说：“我担心有些女同志搬不动它。”他说，用料也太好。苏联有着丰富的森林资源，然而家具生产都是用次料和代用品的。
    前年捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会的二位工人到厂参观，看到他们用上等木料做家具，也大吃一惊。他们耸耸肩说：“在我们的国家里，上等木材都用在工业和建筑上。”
    从那时起，北京木材厂不断从改进设计方面来节约木料，几年来一般产品的成本都降低了20％到30％。
    厂里的保守思想虽然改变了，然而定户依然保持旧的观念，认为木器家具愈重实愈好，有些定户还指定要用什么样的木料定制家具，有些定户设计好了图样要厂里照做。工厂在这些方面迁就了定户，因此，改进设计的工作是很不彻底的。
    经过学习八大文件，这个工厂正确地解决了“为国家节约木材”和“满足人民需要”的矛盾。用最节省的木料，生产出坚固、实用、美观的家具，成了全厂职工一致的信念。
    最近厂里完成了一套新家具的设计，这套家具平均节约了木料21％。我们在陈列室里看到了这套家具的样品，比起以前制作的家具来，确实是轻巧、美观和精致得多。鲁副厂长搬了一张深褐色的椅子来，和那张淡黄色的新椅子并排放在一起，向我们介绍说：“这是从前的，十二斤重；这是新设计的，九斤重。”他说：“这张椅子，用料减少了，但是因为设计的改善和技术的提高，它比以前制造的反而要坚固些。”
    工厂的领导方面最近向全厂职工提出了一个奋斗目标：今年要节约木材二分之一。这就是说，如果今年国家拨给他们的木材，只有去年的一半，他们也将生产跟去年同样多的产品。
