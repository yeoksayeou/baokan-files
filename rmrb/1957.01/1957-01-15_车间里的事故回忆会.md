    A few days ago, the coal washing workshop of Anshan Iron and Steel's Chemical Plant held an accident review meeting, and the meeting was very lively. The workers enthusiastically discussed what accidents had occurred last year, why they happened, and what lessons should be learned from them.

    When it came to Old Chen's matter, everyone's opinions differed. Some said that Old Chen was trying to actively produce, and taking a little risk shouldn't be considered wrong; others said that even for production, one should not violate operating procedures.

    The details of this matter are as follows: In December of last year, after several days of wind and snow, the alcohol column on the thermometer had dropped to minus twenty-eight degrees Celsius. Car after car of coal was frozen in the train cars and couldn't be unloaded, and the coal conveyor belt was also frozen and couldn't move. Workshop Foreman Chen Yuzhong calculated the time and thought that if the coal wasn't sent to the coke ovens soon, less coke would be produced; if he used fire to thaw the ice on the belt, it would take half an hour, how could he wait that long? He remembered his decades of experience and jumped onto the conveyor belt, stepping and jumping on it continuously. Before long, the belt started moving again. This was very dangerous; if he wasn't careful, he could have been carried into the coke oven with the belt. The workshop director had criticized him for this matter. This matter was brought up again during the accident review meeting. After discussion, everyone agreed that even if production was urgent, safety should still be taken into account.

    At the meeting, some people also criticized Tang Mingchen. He believed that since he had worked for more than twenty years without so much as a scratch, he became careless. Once, he even dozed off while the machine was running in the coal storage tank. If someone hadn't woken him up, he would have been buried in the coal pile and lost his life.

    The meeting became more and more heated, and many workers examined their own actions of not paying attention to safety and not following operating procedures. Everyone became alert because of the review of the accidents that had occurred last year and decided to do a better job in safety work in the new year.

    This workshop did not have a single work-related injury from June to the end of last year. The workshop employees launched their second 100-day safety campaign starting from New Year's Day. When asked how they were doing a good job in safety, the branch secretary of the workshop said: Using the masses' examples and the masses' words to educate the masses, and letting the masses examine the causes of accidents and find ways to avoid them, has played a significant role. He mentioned the matter in May of last year. It turned out that the coal washing workshop had a total of sixty-eight accidents in the first five months of last year. In May, the workshop held its first accident review meeting. Before the meeting, dozens of cartoons were exhibited, criticizing some workers for causing accidents due to a lack of attention to safety. Through these cartoons and that review meeting, the workers were reminded and urged to seriously consider the issue of safe production. The entire workshop inspected and found more than 170 places where accidents could occur, and these places were either repaired or had protective devices added. Therefore, work-related injuries were eliminated in the second half of the year. Now, the workers in the coal washing workshop are even more convinced that only safe production can increase production.

    车间里的事故回忆会
    新华社记者　徐放
    前几天，鞍钢化工总厂洗煤车间举行了一次事故回忆会，会议开得很热烈。工人们兴致勃勃地讨论了去年发生了那些事故，它们为什么会发生，以及应该从中吸取那些教训等问题。
    谈到老陈的事情，大家的意见可不一致了。有的说老陈为的是积极生产，冒一点险不能算错；有的说为生产也不能违反操作规程。
    这件事情的原委是这样的：去年12月里，几天风雪，温度计上的酒精柱已经下降到了零下二十八度。一车车的煤冻结在火车箱里卸不下来，送煤的皮带也冻得不能转动了。工长陈玉忠计算着时间，心想再不把煤送到焦炉去，就要少出焦炭了；如果用火来烤化皮带上的冰，也得半小时，那怎么等得及呢？他想起了自己几十年的老经验，就纵身一跃跳上了皮带，踩着皮带不住的跳，隔不了一会皮带就又转动起来了。这样做很危险，一不小心，人也会跟着皮带转到焦炉里去。车间主任为了这事曾经批评过他。这次回忆去年的事故时，又把这事提出来了。讨论的结果大家认为生产再紧张也是应该注意安全的。
    会上还有人批评了唐明臣。他认为自己干了二十多年，没有碰破过一点皮，就马虎大意起来。有一次竟然在贮煤槽里开动机器的时候打起盹来，要不是别人叫醒他，险些把他埋在煤堆里，送了性命。
    会越开越热烈，许多工人都检查了自己不注意安全，不按操作规程办事的事实。大家因为回忆去年发生的事故引起了警惕，决定要在新的一年里把安全工作做得更好。
    这个车间从去年6月到年终没有发生一件工伤事故，车间职工从元旦开始又展开了第二个百日安全运动。当记者问起他们是怎样做好安全工作的时候，这个车间的支部书记说：用群众的事例，群众的话来教育群众，让群众自己检查发生事故的原因和找出避免事故的办法，很起了作用。他提到了去年5月的事。原来洗煤车间在去年前5个月里一共发生了六十八次事故。5月里车间开了第一次事故回忆会。在开会之前，展览了好几十幅漫画，批评了有些工人不注意安全造成事故的情况。通过这些漫画和那次回忆会，提醒了工人，督促他们认真考虑安全生产的问题。全车间检查出了一百七十多处可能发生事故的地方，这些地方都修理好了或是加上了保护装置。因此，在下半年杜绝了工伤事故。现在，洗煤车间的工人更加相信：只有安全生产，才能增加生产。
