Seven Poems
Mao Zedong

Qinyuan Spring
Changsha, in the bleak autumn, I stood alone. The Xiang River flows northward, past Orange Isle. See the myriad hills flushed red, the forests dyed crimson; the river a clear green, a hundred barges vying to sail. Eagles strike the sky, fish dart in the shallows, all creatures under the frosty sky compete in freedom. I sigh at the vastness, and ask the boundless earth, who controls rise and fall? I came here with many companions in my youth, recalling the dense, heroic years of the past. We were young students, full of spirit; our writing forceful and unrestrained. We pointed at the land, stirring up arguments, regarding the powerful officials of the time as mere dirt. Do you remember, going into the river, stemming the waves, holding back the flying boats?

Bodhisattva Barbarian
Yellow Crane Tower. The boundless nine tributaries flow through China, a heavy line pierces the north and south. Misty rain, a vast expanse, Tortoise and Snake mountains lock the great river. Where has the Yellow Crane gone? Only tourists remain. I hold my wine cup and offer a toast, my heart surges with the waves.

Like a Dream
New Year's Day. Ninghua, Qingliu, Guihua, the road is narrow, the forest deep, the moss slippery. Where do we go today? Straight to the foot of Mount Wuyi. Foot of the mountain, foot of the mountain, the wind unfurls the red flag like a painting.

Pure Serene Music
Huichang. The east is about to dawn, don't say the leader has set out early. Having trodden all the green hills, one does not feel old, the scenery here is especially good. The peaks outside Huichang city are connected directly to the Eastern Sea. The soldiers point to southern Guangdong, even more lush and verdant!

Bodhisattva Barbarian
Dabodi. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, who holds the colored silk to dance in the sky? After the rain, the setting sun slants, the passes and mountains are row upon row of green. In those years, the battle was fierce, bullet holes in the walls of the village ahead. Adorning this pass, today it looks even better.

Tune: Memory of Qin E
Loushan Pass. The west wind is fierce, wild geese cry in the long sky, frosty morning moon. Frosty morning moon, the sound of horses' hooves is shattered, the sound of trumpets muffled. The strong pass is like iron, but now we stride forth anew. Stride forth anew, the green mountains are like the sea, the setting sun like blood.

Sixteen-Character Syllable - Three Poems
Mountain! The fast horse whips on, not yet dismounted. Startled, I turn my head, three feet three from the sky [Note].
Mountain! Overturning the sea and toppling rivers, rolling up giant waves. Rushing, surging, ten thousand horses fight with enthusiasm.
Mountain! Piercing the blue sky, the edge not yet broken. The sky is about to fall, relying on it to prop it up.

[Note] Folk Song:
　　Above is Skull Mountain,
　　Below is Eight Treasure Mountain;
　　Three feet three from the sky.
　　People pass, lower their heads,
　　Horses pass, dismount.

(Editor's Note: The first issue of the newly published "Poetry Journal" published eighteen old-style poems and lyrics by Comrade Mao Zedong. This newspaper will reprint ten poems that have not been published in the past or have not been widely copied on the eighth page.)

    词七首
    毛泽东
    沁园春
    长　沙独立寒秋，湘江北去，橘子洲头。看万山红遍，层林尽染；漫江碧透，百舸争流。鹰击长空，鱼翔浅底，万类霜天竞自由。怅寥廓，问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？携来百侣曾游，忆往昔峥嵘岁月稠。恰同学少年，风华正茂；书生意气，挥斥方遒。指点江山，激扬文字，粪土当年万户侯。曾记否，到中流击水，浪遏飞舟？
    菩　萨　蛮
        黄鹤楼茫茫九派流中国，沉沉一线穿南北。烟雨莽苍苍，龟蛇锁大江。黄鹤知何去，剩有游人处。把酒酎滔滔，心潮逐浪高。
    如　梦　令
        元　旦宁化、清流、归化，路隘林深苔滑。今日向何方？直指武夷山下。山下山下，风展红旗如画。
    清　平　乐
        会　昌东方欲晓，莫道君行早。踏遍青山人未老，风景这边独好。会昌城外高峰，颠连直接东溟。战士指看南粤，更加郁郁葱葱！
    菩　萨　蛮
        大柏地赤橙黄绿青蓝紫，谁持彩练当空舞？雨后复斜阳，关山阵阵苍。当年鏖战急，弹洞前村壁。装点此关山，今朝更好看。
    忆　秦　娥
        娄山关西风烈，长空雁叫霜晨月。霜晨月，马蹄声碎，喇叭声咽。雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。从头越，苍山如海，残阳如血。
  十六字令三首山！快马加鞭未下鞍。惊回首，离天三尺三〔注〕。山！倒海翻江卷巨澜。奔腾急，万马战犹酣。山！刺破青天锷未残。天欲堕，赖以拄其间。
  〔注〕民谣：
      上有骷髅山，
      下有八宝山；
      离天三尺三。
      人过要低头，
      马过要下鞍
