    The Objectivity and Social Nature of Beauty
    ——A Critique of Zhu Guangqian and Cai Yi's Aesthetics
    Li Zehou
    After reading the articles by Mr. Cai and Mr. Zhu, I have a few immature
  opinions. Generally speaking, I feel that Cai Yi's criticism of Huang Yaomian and Zhu Guangqian's criticism of Cai Yi are relatively accurate and powerful in exposing each other's mistakes. However, the positive arguments they each put forward are mostly untenable and wrong. The reason for this is that they always, in one way or another, intentionally or unintentionally, either deny the objective existence of beauty (Huang, Zhu) or deny the social nature of beauty (Cai). In their view, the objectivity and social nature of beauty are mutually exclusive and irreconcilable opposites. They believe that if one admits the social nature of beauty, one must deny the objectivity of beauty that is independent of human subjective conditions (consciousness, emotions, etc.); or that if one admits this objectivity of beauty, one must deny the social nature of beauty that is dependent on human social life. But in reality, this is not the case. On the one hand, beauty cannot be separated from human society, but on the other hand, it is an objective existence that can exist independently of human subjective consciousness. I would like to briefly discuss this issue below.
    (I) Is beauty subjective or objective?
    Our debate with Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic views has been and still is focused on this question: Does beauty reside in the mind or in the object? Is beauty subjective or objective? Does aesthetic sense determine beauty, or does beauty determine aesthetic sense? On this key issue of the fundamental opposition between materialism and idealism, Zhu Guangqian, in his self-criticism published in "Wenyi Bao," still insisted on the proposition that "beauty is not only in the object, nor only in the mind, but in the relationship between the mind and the object." And he "still believes that to solve the problem of beauty, it is necessary to achieve the unity of the subjective and the objective." In
  the article "How Can Aesthetics Be Both Materialist and Dialectical?" Zhu Guangqian specifically proposed this proposition in new arguments and new ways:
    "…the object of aesthetic sense is the 'image of the object' rather than the object' itself. The 'image of the object' is the result of the 'object' being reflected in people's consciousness under the influence of people's established subjective conditions (such as ideology, emotions, etc.), so it is only a form of knowledge"…"The reason why this object B (editor's note: refers to 'the image of the object,' i.e., beauty) is produced is not only dependent on the objective conditions of object A, but also requires the influence of people's subjective conditions, so it is a unity of the subjective and the objective" (emphasis added by the editor).
    This is indeed Zhu Guangqian's most basic idea, which runs through this article from beginning to end. Similar expressions and statements can be found everywhere in the article. To summarize Zhu Guangqian's meaning, it is believed that beauty, as the object of aesthetic sense, cannot exist independently of human subjectivity. On the contrary, it must depend on "human subjective conditions." As Zhu Guangqian himself indicated, "human subjective conditions" refer to people's "ideology," "emotions," and so on. Therefore, this means that beauty ("the image of the object") is not an objective existence, but only a subjective "form of knowledge" of human beings. Beauty can only be produced when human subjective consciousness and emotions "influence" external objects. Beauty is the result of human consciousness and emotions acting on external objects. This is the basic point emphasized by Zhu Guangqian in this article that beauty is "the unity of the subjective and the objective."
    However, this statement is basically no different from Zhu Guangqian's previous statements. Zhu Guangqian previously proposed the theory that "beauty is the mind using the form of things to express emotions... all beauty must go through the creation of the mind," believing that beauty certainly needs objective external material "materials," but the reason why these "materials" are beautiful is the result of people's subjective intuition "creating" and "expressing" them, and is the result of the "mind" "expressing" and "conveying" its emotions to "things." Therefore, Zhu Guangqian's main mistake here, in the past, lies in and still lies in canceling the objectivity of beauty, and establishing beauty in the subjective aesthetic sense, equating objective beauty with and subordinating it to subjective aesthetic sense, and regarding beauty as the result and product of aesthetic sense. In the article, although Zhu Guangqian proposed the two concepts of "beauty" and "aesthetic sense," he never distinguished and demonstrated the fundamental difference between the subjective and objective natures of the two as reflector and reflected. On the contrary, Zhu Guangqian confused them everywhere, and everywhere regarded the subjectivity of aesthetic sense dependent on human consciousness as the so-called "subjectivity" of beauty, and confused aesthetic sense with beauty as the object of aesthetic sense. The objective "object A" that Zhu Guangqian called the objective "object A" as the "certain conditions" for the production of beauty is actually only a Kantian "thing-in-itself" existence that does not play any role. Its becoming "object B" (beauty) completely depends on and is determined by human subjective consciousness and aesthetic sense. Therefore, here, aesthetic sense and subjective consciousness are fundamental and primary; beauty is derivative and secondary. The following passage is used by Zhu Guangqian to explain aesthetic sense, but if it is compared with the explanation of beauty in the article, it can be seen that there is no difference between them: "In the process of aesthetic sense reflecting the external world, subjective conditions play a great and even decisive role. It is a unity of the subjective and the objective, and a unity of naturalness and social nature." From this, the naked logical conclusion that aesthetic sense determines beauty will of course be drawn: "Aesthetic sense can affect the formation of object B." "Because…subjective conditions (aesthetic ability) are not enough…the beautiful image (object B) cannot be produced." Therefore, this is completely the same as using "aesthetic experience" to replace and determine beauty in "literary psychology," believing that beauty is the result and product of "aesthetic experience." Zhu Guangqian's "unity of the subjective and the objective" theory, which he now hopes to be "both materialist and dialectical," is actually still the subjective idealism of aesthetic sense determining beauty, the subjective determining the objective, and "the mind using things to express emotions."
    However, are Zhu Guangqian's current views completely the same as before? That's not the case either. In addition to Zhu Guangqian's fundamentally different subjective intentions (that is, the current hope to establish a materialist aesthetics), there is also an important difference: that is, in the past, Zhu Guangqian emphasized the mysterious personal intuitive nature of beauty and aesthetic sense that transcends utilitarianism and society, while now Zhu Guangqian admits and emphasizes the social nature of beauty (actually aesthetic sense, i.e., ideology, emotions, etc.) of the era, class, and nation. Therefore, the so-called "subjective" and the so-called "mind" in Zhu Guangqian's statement that "beauty is the unity of the subjective and the objective" and "beauty lies between the relationship between the mind and things," if in the past mainly referred to the ultra-social, mysterious personal "subjective" and personal "mind"; then, now it mainly refers to the "subjective" of social human beings and the "mind" of society, and refers to the consciousness and emotions of society, the era, and the class. Recognizing the social nature of human subjective consciousness and aesthetic sense is certainly a great progress. But this has not fundamentally changed the problem. Because even if one admits the social nature of beauty and refuses to admit that beauty is an objective existence that is independent of human subjective consciousness, that is to say, even if one admits that beauty is not dependent on individual intuitive emotions, but believes that it is dependent on social consciousness and social emotions, it is still not materialism. So-called social consciousness and social emotions are still subjective and derivative things for social existence. It can only constitute the social nature of aesthetic sense (that is to say, any individual's aesthetic sense is the expression of a certain social consciousness and emotion), but it cannot constitute the social nature of beauty. Therefore, Zhu Guangqian is completely wrong to regard the social nature of beauty as being dependent on human social consciousness and emotions, and to regard the social nature of beauty as the subjectivity of beauty, because what depends on and belongs to social consciousness (human subjective conditions) is only aesthetic sense, not beauty. Beauty has social nature, but it does not have the "subjectivity" that Zhu Guangqian speaks of.
    From this comes the second important argument in Zhu Guangqian's article, which is also the second important mistake, which is that aesthetic sense can "influence" beauty:
  "Beauty can develop with the development of aesthetic sense," "In the process of aesthetic power becoming more and more refined, the beauty of things not only becomes richer and more elevated in scope but also in degree." We firmly disagree with this argument. The reason why we cannot agree that beauty develops with the development of aesthetic sense is, simply put, just as we cannot agree with the idea that social existence develops with the development of social consciousness. The development of social existence develops with the development of the social mode of production, not with the development of social consciousness. The "reaction" of social consciousness only means accelerating or slowing down this development. Similarly, beauty does not develop with the development of aesthetic sense, but with the development of social life. In the course of human history, with the increasing perfection of social material life and with the increasing improvement of people's spiritual outlook, the beauty of social life is also increasing and developing. Primitive communes do not have the beauty of socialist life, and the beauty of the personality of revolutionary fighters cannot be produced in the barbaric era. Therefore, there must first be the development of life and the development of beauty, and then the aesthetic sense that reflects life and reflects beauty can have the possibility of development. Otherwise, the development of aesthetic sense will have no foundation and basis, and will become a tree without roots and a water without a source. Therefore, it is not beauty that develops with the development of aesthetic sense, but on the contrary, it is aesthetic sense that develops with the development of beauty. As for the "reaction" of aesthetic sense on beauty and "influencing" beauty, this mainly means that aesthetic sense reflects beauty through art, and art can in turn enrich and improve people's spiritual outlook, which enhances the beauty of social life and promotes the development of social life and beauty. It is clear that this is fundamentally different from Zhu Guangqian's so-called "reaction" that aesthetic sense can directly determine the development of beauty.
    There are some other mistakes in Zhu Guangqian's article (such as the separation of scientific objects and artistic objects, the understanding of "reality" in "art reflects reality," etc.), but due to space limitations, I cannot criticize them one by one here. Huang Yaomian's mistakes are roughly similar to Zhu Guangqian's, but they are expressed more obscurely. Cai Yi's article has revealed them in detail, so I will not talk about them here.
      (II) Can beauty exist independently of human society?
    If our disagreement with Zhu Guangqian is on the issue of the objectivity of beauty; then, our disagreement with Cai Yi is on the issue of the social nature of beauty. The basic characteristic of Cai Yi's aesthetic view lies in: emphasizing the objective existence of beauty, but denying the fundamental nature of beauty as dependent on human society.
    Zhu Guangqian has already pointed out this characteristic of Cai Yi, so I will not repeat it here. But in the article criticizing Huang Yaomian, Cai Yi, in addition to vaguely emphasizing that "the image of things exists independently of the appraiser, and the beauty of the image of things also exists independently of the appraiser," did not further explain positively: How does beauty "exist independently of the appraiser"? How does it exist in the objective things themselves? What is the difference between its objective existence and the objective existence of the material world that we usually say is independent of human beings? (That is to say, are the two kinds of objective existence of Cai Yi's so-called "image of things" and "the beauty of the image of things" completely the same?) Regarding these questions, Cai Yi's previous book "New Aesthetics" has quite specific and detailed explanations (Cai Yi is still sticking to these theories in "New Aesthetics" when teaching aesthetics in the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University, so "New Aesthetics" can basically still represent Cai Yi's current views).
    "The essence of beauty is the typicality of things, that is, the general of the species is manifested in the individual" ("New Aesthetics," Mass Publishing House, 1947 edition, p. 68).
      "In short, beautiful things are typical things, that is, the manifester of the universality and necessity of the species" (ibid., p. 80. All emphasis added by the citer).
    That is to say, beauty is typicality, and typicality is the individual things that manifest the universal and necessary species attributes (mathematical, mechanical, physical, biological... attributes) of the species. Why is the straight ancient pine beautiful? According to Cai Yi's theory, this is because it "manifests" the universal and necessary species attributes of biological form—"balance and symmetry." Then, why are "reclining ancient pines" and "leaning weak willows" beautiful? That is because they "although cannot express the universality of biological form, can express their vigorous and unyielding vitality, that is, they express the most important universality of biology" (ibid., p. 79).
    It is clear that this is to归结 beauty or typicality to a natural attribute or condition that exists independently of human society. That is to say, the objective existence of beauty is exactly the same as the objective existence of the material world, and exists independently of human existence. Therefore, without human beings or before human beings, beauty objectively exists, existing in nature itself. Therefore, many people go to find the standards of beauty in natural things themselves, and find "golden section," "balanced unity of form"... and so on. They always try to prove that beauty exists in this simple mechanical mathematical proportion, physical performance, and form style of objective things, and歸结 beauty to this simple, low-level mechanical, physical, and biological natural condition or attribute, believing that this natural attribute and condition of objective things themselves is beauty. Cai Yi believes in exactly this metaphysical materialist aesthetic view. Obviously, this aesthetic view cannot really solve the complex problem of beauty but instead leaves an excuse for idealism to attack. The tree grows straight is straight, why is it beautiful? Why are many other things with "balance and symmetry" not beautiful? High mountains and seas, spring flowers and autumn moons, this is purely a natural material phenomenon, if it is said that beauty lies in itself, then why does the human aesthetic sense caused by it change with the times and environment? If according to Cai Yi's theory, then the creature that neither expresses the universal species attribute on the form ("balanced unity") nor expresses the universal species attribute on the nature ("vigorous and thriving")—such as "withered vines, old trees, and dusk crows"—must be not beautiful. According to Cai Yi's theory, a scientific natural picture and a landscape painting must have the same aesthetic value. Because they all equally express the beautiful law of "balanced symmetry" of natural objects... Obviously these are quite absurd. At the same time, because this theory often abstracts some natural attributes of objects such as volume, form, and growth from various specific objects, rigidifies them, and says that this is the law of beauty. In fact, this is to regard beauty and the law of beauty as an unchanging, absolute natural scale of abstract objective existence. This scale has actually become an abstract a priori entity existence that transcends specific perceptual things, and the beauty of each specific object is only "manifested" this scale. It should be said that this is very close to the view of Plato and Hegel that beauty is the embodiment of the concept (entity). Therefore, Chernyshevsky's criticism of Hegel is also quite applicable to Cai Yi. Chernyshevsky once asked: Where is the beauty of a certain specific frog that most fully manifests the universal necessary concept of the frog (in Cai Yi's case, it is a certain most "typical" frog that most fully "manifests" the universal necessary species attribute of the frog)?
      (III) The Objectivity and Social Nature of Beauty are Unified
    Therefore, to truly solve the problem of the objective existence of beauty, one must not deny it but must recognize the social nature of beauty. It should be seen that beauty, like goodness, is only a product of human society, and they only have meaning for people and for human society. Before human beings, the universe and space had no so-called beauty and ugliness, just as there was no so-called good and evil at that time. Beauty is human social life, and beauty is the concrete social and natural images that contain the essence, laws, and ideals of social development in real life and can be directly perceived by the senses. The essence, laws, and ideals of social life that we speak of are not a spiritual concept or entity that can exist independently of life, on the contrary, it is only life itself. It is the vigorous and constantly developing revolutionary practice of mankind, including the struggle for production and the class struggle. Its relationship with a specific and limited life image is only the inseparable unity of content and form. Broad objective social nature and vivid and concrete imagery are the two basic attributes of beauty.
    Therefore, the social nature of beauty that we recognize is not only different from the "embodiment of ideas" (things that embody the ideas of freedom and progress are beautiful, etc.) spoken of by objective idealism, but also fundamentally different from Zhu Guangqian's statement that the social nature of beauty is its subjectivity. Because the social nature of beauty that we speak of refers to beauty being dependent on human social life, and is this life itself, rather than referring to beauty being dependent on people's subjective conditions of ideology and emotions, even if this ideology and emotion are social, class, and era. Therefore, one must never confuse the social nature of beauty with the social nature of aesthetic sense. The social nature of aesthetic sense (social consciousness) is derivative and subjective, and the social nature of beauty (social existence) is fundamental and objective. Of course, the so-called objectivity of social existence "does not mean that the society of conscious beings, that is, people's society, can exist and develop independently of the existence of conscious beings, but that social existence is independent of people's social consciousness." "From the fact that people enter into communication as conscious beings, it cannot be concluded that social consciousness is equivalent to social existence" ("Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," People's Publishing House, 1956 edition, pp. 334, 332). This is very important, and many people make mistakes precisely because they often cannot figure this out. They feel that since social existence is human social existence, and human beings have consciousness and emotions, therefore, existence dependent on society seems to exist dependent on the existence of human consciousness and emotions. In this way, they often confuse social existence with social consciousness. Zhu Guangqian believes that the social nature of beauty is its subjectivity, and his mistake lies precisely here. However, the social nature of beauty is not the subjectivity of beauty, but precisely the objectivity of beauty, because on the one hand, beauty cannot be separated from "the existence of conscious beings," that is, it cannot exist without human beings, and on the other hand, it is not dependent on "conscious beings," that is, human consciousness and emotions, that is, it is not dependent on the individual or social subjective aesthetic sense. Therefore, the social nature and objectivity of beauty are not contradictory, but are fundamentally and inseparably unified.
    The social nature of beauty in social life should not have too many doubts. The problem often occurs in the aspect of natural beauty.
    On the surface, natural beauty is indeed the most troublesome problem, because here, the objectivity and social nature of beauty seem difficult to unify. Precisely because of this, one-sided views holding one end or the other have arisen: either believing that nature itself has no beauty, and beauty is only added by human subjective consciousness (Zhu), or believing that natural beauty is in its own natural conditions, and it has nothing to do with human beings (Cai). However, the fact is that natural beauty is neither in nature itself, nor is it added by human subjective consciousness, but like the beauty of social phenomena, it is also an objective social existence. "The reality of the object is everywhere the reality of human essence
          the reality of power, is the reality of man... For man, all objects are the objectification of himself" (Marx: "Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts"). Nature exists as an object of man in human society. Nature at this time exists in a specific social relationship, and it is inextricably linked to human life, and there is a specific objective social relationship. Therefore, it itself is already very different from the nature before the production of human society, and has already had a social nature. It itself already contains the "alienation" (objectification) of the human essence, and it is already a "humanized nature." It is clear that this "humanized nature" and this social nature of nature is still not something that can be determined by human consciousness and emotions, or something that is added by subjective consciousness, but is invisible and intangible but objectively exists. This is just like gold and silver as currency and machines as means of production, in addition to their visible and tangible physical natural properties, they also have an invisible and intangible but indeed existing objective social property. This objective social nature is concretely dependent on objective social existence. When society changes, this property of course changes accordingly. Therefore, just as machines and gold and silver in the capitalist system and in the socialist system have the same natural properties but their social properties have greatly changed, the social nature of natural beauty also develops and changes with the development and change of society, even though its natural attributes or conditions have not changed much. Only by deeply understanding this point can we understand many questions: For example, why are rats and flies beautiful and not beautiful compared to ancient pines and plum blossoms? This is because their social nature is different, their relationship with human life, their position in human life, and the various roles they play are different. Why couldn't ancient people appreciate natural beauty but now they can? Why does the same mountain and river evoke a feeling of "remaining water and broken mountains" when foreign tribes invade, but evoke a feeling of solemnity and grandeur today? It is clear that this not only shows that people's subjective aesthetic sense has changed, but also shows that the objective social nature of natural beauty itself (that is, its objective social relationship with people) has also changed. And the reason why aesthetic sense produces change is precisely because beauty itself has produced change. Of course, on the other hand, our recognition of the social nature of natural beauty does not deny that certain natural attributes of objects are necessary conditions for the composition of beauty, such as the huge volume of high mountains and seas and the dim light of the moon and stars, which are necessary natural conditions for the composition of grandeur or grace, and the "balanced symmetry" of objects is also true. But these conditions themselves are not beauty, and they can only serve as conditions for beauty when they are in a certain human society. This is just like the fact that gold and silver as currency must have the natural attribute of weight, but the natural attribute of weight itself cannot constitute currency, and it can only become a condition for currency in human society.
    Finally, let's use a popular example of the national flag to explain the whole problem. We Chinese people today feel a strong sense of solemnity and pride when we see the five-star red flag, and we all feel that our national flag is very beautiful. Then, is the beauty of the national flag added by our subjective aesthetic consciousness? Is the beauty of the national flag that our subjective aesthetic sense feels it is beautiful? Of course not, on the contrary, our subjective aesthetic sense is caused by the beauty of the objectively existing national flag, and we feel that the national flag is beautiful because the national flag is originally a reflection of beauty. Then, where is the beauty of the national flag itself? Is it because this red cloth with yellow five-pointed stars "manifests" some "universal species attributes" or "balanced symmetry" and other laws? Of course not. The red cloth and yellow stars themselves have no beauty, its beauty lies in that it represents China, represents this independent, free, happy, great country, people, and society, and this representation is an objective reality. That is to say, the national flag—this red cloth and yellow stars, itself has become a humanized object, it itself has an objective social nature and social significance, it is the "reality of the essential power" of the Chinese people, and that's why it is beautiful. Therefore, its beauty is still an objective (not dependent on human subjective consciousness and emotions) social (cannot be separated from social life) existence, is the objective existence of the national, people's, and social life of the new China, and our aesthetic sense (we feel that the national flag is beautiful) is still the subjective reflection of the beauty of this objective existence, is our understanding of the beauty of our country and society today.
    Due to space limitations, many important issues (such as the significance of recognizing the objectivity and social nature of beauty for today's art work) cannot be discussed, and even the issues discussed have not been fully and meticulously argued. These can only be supplemented later. In addition, my article "On Aesthetic Sense, Beauty, and Art" ("Philosophical Research" No. 5, 1956) can be temporarily used as a supplement and reference to this article.
    To sum up our opinion, it is believed that: beauty is social and objective, and they are a unified existence. Denying any aspect of it is wrong.

    美的客观性和社会性
    ——评朱光潜、蔡仪的美学观
    李泽厚
    读了蔡、朱两位先生的文章，有几点不成熟的
  意见。总的说来，觉得蔡仪对黄药眠的批评、朱光潜对蔡仪的批评，在揭露对方的错误这一方面，都比较准确和有力。但是，他们各自提出来的正面论点，却大都是站不住脚的，错误的。而所以如此，是在于他们总是这样那样地、有意无意地不是否认美的存在的客观性（黄、朱），便是否认美的存在的社会性（蔡）。在他们那里，美的客观性与社会性是非此即彼、互相排斥的不可统一的对立，以为如果承认了美的社会性就必需否认美的不依存于人类主观条件（意识、情趣等）的客观性；或者是以为承认了美的这种客观性，就必须否认美的依存于人类社会生活的社会性。但实际并不如此，美一方面既不能脱离人类社会，另一方面却又是能独立于人类主观意识之外的客观存在。下面想就这个问题简单地谈谈。
    （一）美是主观的还是客观的？
    我们和朱光潜的美学观的争论，过去是现在也仍然是集中在这个问题上：美在心还是在物？美是主观的还是客观的？是美感决定美呢还是美决定美感？在这个唯物主义与唯心主义根本对立的关键问题上，朱光潜在“文艺报”发表的自我批评中，仍是坚持“美不仅在物，亦不仅在心，它在心与物的关系上面”的主张的。并且“还是认为要解决美的问题，必须达到主观与客观的统一”。在
  “美学怎样才能既是唯物的又是辩证的”一文中，朱光潜就把这种主张具体地以新的论点和新的方式提出来了：
    “……美感的对象是‘物的形象’而不是物’本身。‘物的形象’是‘物’在人的既定的主观条件（如意识形态，情趣等）的影响下反映于人的意识的结果，所以只是一种知识形式”……“这物乙（引者按：即指‘物的形象’，即指美）之所以产生，却不单靠物甲的客观条件，还须加上人的主观条件的影响，所以是主观与客观的统一”（重点皆引者所加）。
    这确是朱光潜最基本的思想，它从头到尾贯彻在这篇文章中，类似的提法、说法，文中到处可见。总括朱光潜的意思，是认为，作为美感对象的美，并不能独立于人的主观之外，恰好相反，而是必须依存于“人的主观条件”的。而所谓“人的主观条件”就如朱光潜自己所标明，是指人的“意识形态”、“情趣”等等。所以，这就是说美（“物的形象”）并不是一种客观的存在，只是人的一种主观的“知识形式”，必须有人的主观意识、情趣“影响”外物才能产生美，美是人的意识、情趣作用于外物的结果。这就是朱光潜这篇文章中所强调的美是“主客观的统一”的基本要点所在。
    但是，这种说法与朱光潜过去的说法基本上是没有什么不同的。朱光潜过去曾提出“美是心借物的形相来表现情趣……凡美都要经过心灵的创造”的理论，认为美固然需要客观外界的物质“材料”，但这些“材料”所以是美，则是人的主观直觉“创造”“表现”的结果，是“心”把自己的情趣“抒发”“传达”给“物”的结果。所以，朱光潜在这里的主要错误，过去在于现在就仍然在于取消了美的客观性，而在主观的美感中来建立美，把客观的美等同于、从属于主观的美感，把美看作是美感的结果、美感的产物。在文章中，朱光潜虽然提出了“美”和“美感”的两个概念，但却始终没有区分和论证两者作为反映和被反映者的主、客观性质的根本不同；恰好相反，朱光潜处处混淆了它们，处处把依存于人类意识的美感的主观性看作是美的所谓“主观性”，把美感和作为美感对象的美混为一谈。朱光潜所谓作为产生美的“某些条件”的客观的“物甲”，就实际上只是一种不起任何作用的康德“物自体”式的存在，它之成为“物乙”（美），完全依赖于、被决定于人的主观意识、美感。所以，在这里，美感、主观意识就是基元的，第一性的；美则是派生的，第二性的。下面这段话是朱光潜用以说明美感的，但若与文中关于美的说明对照一下，便可以看出，它们并无差别；“美感在反映外物界的过程中，主观条件却有很大的甚至是决定性的作用，它是主观与客观的统一，自然性与社会性的统一。”由此就当然会得出赤裸裸的美感决定美的逻辑结论：“美感能影响物乙的形成”。“由于……主观条件（美感能力）不够……不能产生美的形象（物乙）”，所以，这与“文艺心理学”中用“美感经验”来代替美、决定美，认为美是“美感经验”的结果和产物完全一样，朱光潜现在希望是“既唯物又辩证”的“主客观的统一”论就实际上仍然是美感决定美，主观决定客观、“心借物以表现情趣”的主观唯心主义。
    但是，朱光潜现在的观点与以前的是不是完全相同呢？那也不是。除了朱光潜主观意图根本不同以外（即现在是希望建立唯物主义的美学），还有一个重要的区别：那就是过去朱光潜所强调的是美和美感超功利超社会的神秘的个人直觉性质，而现在朱光潜是承认和强调了美（实际上是美感、即意识形态、情趣等）的时代、阶级、民族的社会性质。因此，朱光潜所说的“美是主客观的统一”“美在心物关系之间”的所谓“主观”，所谓“心”，如果说，在过去主要是指超社会的、神秘的个人的“主观”、个人的“心”；那末，现在则主要是指作为社会的人的“主观”、社会的“心”，是指社会、时代、阶级的意识、情趣了。承认了人的主观意识和美感的社会性质，当然是一大进步。但这并未根本改变问题。因为即使承认了美（美感）的社会性而拒绝承认美是不依赖人类主观意识的客观存在，这就是说，即使承认了美是不依存于个人的直觉情趣，但却认为它依存于社会的意识、社会的情趣，就仍然不是唯物主义。所谓社会意识、社会情趣，对社会存在来说，它仍然是主观的、派生的东西，它只能构成美感的社会性（这就是说，任何个人的美感是一定的社会意识、情趣的表现），而不能构成美的社会性。所以，朱光潜把美的社会性看作是因为它依存于人类社会意识、情趣的原故，把美的社会性看作是美的主观性，这就完全错误了，因为依存于、从属于社会意识（人的主观条件）的只是美感，而不是美。美具有社会性，但不具有如朱光潜说的这种“主观性”。
    由此而来的朱光潜文章中的第二个重要论点也是第二个重要错误，是认为美感能“影响”美：
  “美可随美感的发展而发展”，“在美感力日渐精锐化的过程中，事物的美不但在范围上而且在程度上都日渐丰富和提高起来”。我们坚决不能够同意这一论点。我们之不能同意美随美感的发展而发展，简单说来，就正如不能同意认为社会存在是随社会意识的发展而发展一样。社会存在的发展是随社会生产方式的发展而发展的，而不是随社会意识的发展而发展。社会意识的“反作用”，只是意味着加速或减慢这种发展。同样，美也并不是随美感的发展而发展，而是随社会生活的发展而发展的。在人类历史行程中，随着社会物质生活的日益完善，随着人的精神面貌的日益提高，社会生活的美也就日益增长、发展起来。原始公社没有社会主义生活的美，野蛮时代产生不了革命战士人格的美。所以，必须先有生活的发展、美的发展，然后，作为反映生活反映美的美感才有发展的可能，否则，美感的发展就没有它的基础和依据，变成无根之木，无源之水了。因此，并不是美随美感的发展而发展，恰好要倒过来，是美感随美的发展而发展。至于美感的“反作用”于美，“影响”美，这主要是说美感通过艺术反映了美，而艺术又能反过来丰富和提高人的精神面貌，这就增进了社会生活的美，促进社会生活和美的发展。很清楚，这与朱光潜认为美感可以直接决定美的发展的所谓“反作用”是根本不同的。
    朱光潜文章中还有一些错误（如对科学对象和艺术对象的割裂，对“艺术反映现实”的“现实”的理解、等等），因限于篇幅，这里就不能逐一批评了。黄药眠的错误大体与朱光潜相似，只是表现得隐晦些，蔡仪的文章已详细揭出，这里也不谈了。
      （二）美能脱离人类社会而存在吗？
    如果说，我们与朱光潜的分歧是在美的客观性的问题上；那末，我们与蔡仪的分歧就在美的社会性的问题上。蔡仪的美学观的基本特点在于：强调了美的客观性的存在，但却否认了美的依存于人类社会的根本性质。
    蔡仪的这一特点，朱光潜已有所指明，这里不复述。但在批评黄药眠的文章中，蔡仪除了笼统地强调“物的形象是不依赖于鉴赏者的人而存在的，物的形象的美也是不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的”以外，并没有进一步正面说明：美究竟是怎样“不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在”的？它究竟是怎样存在在客观的物的本身中？它的这种客观存在与我们日常说的物质世界的不依赖于人的客观存在又有什么不同没有？（这即是说，蔡仪所谓的
  “物的形象”与“物的形象的美”的这两种客观存在是不是完全一样？）关于这些问题，蔡仪以前写的“新美学”一书中则有相当具体、详细的说明（蔡仪现在清华大学建筑系讲美学也仍坚持了
  “新美学”中的这些理论，所以“新美学”基本上仍可以代表蔡仪现在的观点）。
    “美的本质就是事物的典型性，就是个别之中显现着种类的一般”（“新美学”，群众出版社1947年版，第68页）。
      “总之，美的事物就是典型的事物，就是种类的普遍性必然性的显现者”（同上书，第80页。以上重点皆引用者加）。
    这就是说，美是典型，典型是显现了种类的普遍性必然性即物体的普遍一般的自然属性（数学的、机械的、物理的、生物的……属性）的个别事物。劲直的古松为什么美呢？照蔡仪的理论，这是因为它“显现了”生物形体上的普遍必然的种类属性——“均衡和对称”。那末，“偃卧的古松”“欹斜的弱柳”又为什么美呢？那是因为它们“虽然不能表现生物形体上的普遍性，却能表现着它们枝叶向荣不屈的不挠的欣欣生意，就是表现了生物的最主要的普遍性了”（同上书，第79页）。
    很清楚，这就是把美或典型归结为一种不依存于人类社会而独立存在的自然属性或条件。这就是说，美的客观存在和物质世界的客观存在完全一样，是不依赖于人类的存在而存在的。因此，没有人类或在人类以前，美就客观存在着，存在在自然界的本身中。因此许多人便到自然事物本身中去寻找美的标准，找出了“黄金分割”“形态的均衡统一”……等等。他们总是企图证明美是存在在客观事物的这种简单的机械的数学比例，物理性能，形态式样中，把美归结为这种简单的低级的机械、物理、生物的自然条件或属性，认为客观物体的这种自然属性、条件本身就是美。蔡仪所信奉的就正是这种形而上学唯物主义的美学观。显然这种美学观并不能真正解决美的复杂问题而反给唯心主义留下了攻击的借口。树长得直就是直，为什么是美呢？为什么许多别的“均衡和对称”的东西又不美呢？高山大海，春花秋月，这纯粹是一种自然物质现象，如说美就在其本身，那为什么由它引起的人的美感却随时代和环境而有变易呢？如果照蔡仪的理论，那既没表现形体上的普遍种类属性（“均衡统一”），又没表现本性上的普遍种类属性（“枝叶向荣，欣欣生意”）的生物——例如“枯藤老树昏鸦”，那一定是不美了。照蔡仪的理论，一张科学的自然图片和一张风景画，其美学价值就必然是相同的了。因为它们都同样表现了自然对象的“均衡对称”的美的法则……显然这些是相当荒唐的。同时，因为这种理论常常是把物体的某些自然属性如体积、形态、生长等等从各种具体的物体中抽象出来，僵化起来，说这就是美的法则。这实际上，就是把美和美的法则看作是一种一成不变的绝对的自然尺度的抽象的客观存在，这种尺度实际上就已成了一种超脱具体感性事物的抽象的先天的实体的存在了，各个具体物体的美就只是
  “显现了”这个尺度而已。应该说，这已十分接近于柏拉图、黑格尔认为美是观念（实体）的体现的观点了。所以，车尔尼雪夫斯基对黑格尔的批判，也相当适用于蔡仪。车尔尼雪夫斯基曾问：最充分地显现了青蛙这个普遍必然观念的某个具体的青蛙（在蔡仪那里，就是最充分地“显现”了青蛙的普遍必然的种类属性的某个最“典型的”青蛙），到底又美在哪里呢？
      （三）美的客观性和社会性是统一的
    所以，要真正解决美的客观存在问题，就不能否认而要去承认美的社会性。应该看到，美，与善一样，都只是人类社会的产物，它们都只对于人、对于人类社会才有意义。在人类以前，宇宙太空无所谓美丑，就正如当时无所谓善恶一样。美是人类的社会生活，美是现实生活中那些包含着社会发展的本质、规律和理想而用感官可以直接感知的具体的社会形象和自然形象。我们所说的社会生活的本质规律和理想，并不是一种可以超脱生活而独存的精神性的概念或实体，恰好相反，它只是生活本身，它是包括生产斗争和阶级斗争在内的人类蓬蓬勃勃不断发展的革命实践。它与具体、有限的某个生活形象的关系，只是内容与形式不可分割的统一的关系。宽广的客观社会性和生动的具体形象性是美的两个基本属性的条件。
    所以，我们所承认的美的社会性不但与客观唯心主义所讲的“观念的体现”说（体现了自由、进步观念的事物是美等）不同，而同时也与朱光潜所讲的美的社会性就是它的主观性也根本异样。因为我们所讲的美的社会性是指美依存于人类社会生活，是这生活本身，而不是指美依存于人的主观条件的意识形态、情趣，即使这意识这情趣是社会的、阶级的、时代的。所以，就决不能把美的社会性与美感的社会性混为一谈，美感的社会性（社会意识）是派生的，主观的，美的社会性
  （社会存在）是基元的，客观的。当然，所谓社会存在的客观性，“并不是指有意识的存在物的社会，即人们的社会，能够不依赖于有意识的存在物的存在而存在和发展，而是指社会存在是不依存于人们的社会意识的。”“从人们在进入交往时是作为意识的存在物而进入的这一点之中，决不能得出社会意识是与社会存在等同的”（“唯物主义与经验批判主义”，人民出版社1956年版，第334、第332页）。这一点很重要，许多人犯错误就正因为常常搞不清这点。他们觉得，社会存在既是人的社会存在，而人是有意识、情趣的，因此，依存于社会的存在就好像是依存于人的意识、情感的存在而存在了。这样，就常把社会存在与社会意识混同起来。朱光潜认为美的社会性就是它的主观性，其错误就正在这里。但是，美的社会性却并不是美的主观性，而恰恰正是美的客观性，因为美一方面既不能脱离“有意识的存在物的存在而存在”，即不脱离人类而存在，而另一方面又是不依存于“有意识的存在物”的即人类的意识、情趣，亦即不依存于个人的或社会的主观美感的。所以，美的社会性与客观性不但不矛盾，而且是根本不可分割地统一着的。
    社会生活中美的社会性，本来是不会有太多的疑问的。问题常常是发生在自然美的方面。
    表面看来，自然美的确是最麻烦的问题，因为在这里，美的客观性与社会性似乎很难统一。正因为如此，就产生了各持一端的片面的观点：不是认为自然本身无美，美只是人类主观意识加上去的（朱），便是认为自然美在其本身的自然条件，它与人类无关（蔡）。然而事实却是：自然美既不在自然本身，又不是人类主观意识加上去的，而与社会现象的美一样，也是一种客观社会性的存在。“对象的现实处处都是人的本质
          力量的现实，都是人的现实……对于人来说，一切对象都是他本身的对象化”（马克思：“经济学—哲学手稿”）。自然在人类社会中是作为人的对象而存在着的。自然这时是存在在一种具体社会关系之中，它与人类生活已休戚攸关地存在着一种具体的客观的社会关系。所以这时它本身就已大大不同于人类社会产生前的自然，而已具有了一种社会性质。它本身已包含了人的本质的“异化”（对象化），它已是一种“人化的自然”了。很清楚，这个“人化的自然”、这种自然的社会性，就仍然不是人类意识情趣之类的主观所能决定的或主观意识所加上去的东西，而是看不见摸不着然而却客观存在着的。这就正如作为货币的金银，作为生产工具的机器，它们可见可触的物理自然性能以外，而且还具有着一种看不见摸不着但却确然存在的客观社会性能一样。这种客观的社会性质是具体地依存于客观的社会存在，社会变了，这种性能当然也跟着变。所以正如机器、金银在资本主义制度下和在社会主义制度下，其自然性能完全一样而其社会性能却大有变异一样，自然美的社会性也是随社会的发展变化而发展变化的，尽管它的自然属性或条件并没什么移改。只有深入理解这一点，才能理解许多问题：例如，老鼠、苍蝇与古松、梅花为什么有美有不美呢？这就是因为它们的社会性不同，它们与人类生活的关系，它们在人类生活中所占的地位，所起的作用种种的不同而决定的。为什么远古人们不能欣赏自然美而现在能呢？同一山河，为什么在异族入侵时令人起“剩水残山”的感觉而今天则起庄严雄伟的感觉呢？很清楚，这不但表明人们的主观的美感已有了变异，而更表明自然美本身的客观社会性质（亦即它与人们的客观的社会关系），也有了变易的原故。并且，美感之所以产生变易也正因为美本身产生了变易。当然，另一方面我们承认自然美的社会性，并不是否认物体的某些自然属性是构成美的必要条件，如高山大海的巨大体积，月亮星星的黯淡光亮，就是构成壮美或优美的必要自然条件，物体的“均衡对称”也是如此。但是这些条件本身并不是美，它只有处在一定的人类社会中才能作为美的条件。这就正如作为货币的金银必需有重量这样一个自然属性，但重量这个自然属性本身并不能构成货币，它只有在人类社会中才能成为货币的条件一样。
    最后举一个通俗的国旗的例子把整个问题说明一下。我们中国人今天看到五星红旗都起一种庄严自豪的强烈的美感，都感到我们的国旗很美。那末，国旗的美是不是我们主观的美感意识加上去的呢？是不是国旗的美在于我们的主观美感感到它美呢？当然不是，恰好相反，我们主观的美感是由客观存在着的国旗的美引起来的，我们感到国旗美，是因为国旗本来就美的反映。那么，国旗本身又美在哪里呢？是不是因为这块贴着黄色五角星的红布“显现了”什么“普遍种类属性”“均衡对称”之类的法则呢？当然不是。一块红布、黄星本身并没有什么美，它的美是在于它代表了中国，代表了这个独立、自由、幸福、伟大的国家、人民和社会，而这种代表是客观的现实。这也就是说，国旗——这块红布黄星、本身已成了人化的对象，它本身已具有了客观的社会性质、社会意义，它是中国人民“本质力量的现实”，正因为这样，它才美。所以，它的美就仍是一种客观的（不依存于人类主观意识、情趣的）社会的（不能脱离社会生活的）存在，是新中国的国家、人民和社会生活的客观存在，而我们的美感（我们感到国旗美）就仍然是这一客观存在的美的主观的反映，是我们对我们今天的国家社会的美的认识。
    因为限于篇幅，许多重要问题（例如认识美的客观性和社会性对今日艺术工作的意义）都没法谈了，即使谈到的问题也远未能作充分、细致的论证。这些只好以后再补了。此外，拙作“论美感、美和艺术”一文（“哲学研究”1956年第5期）则可暂作本文的补充、参考。
    总括我们的意见，是认为：美是社会的，又是客观的，它们是统一的存在。否认其中任何一方面，都是错误的。
