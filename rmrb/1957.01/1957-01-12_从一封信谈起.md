    Starting from a Letter
    On November 19th of last year, a letter sent by the post office was placed on the desk of the secretarial section of the Food Industry Bureau of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry. What was strange was that the sending agency, the Labor and Wage Section, and the receiving agency, were working on the same floor. Why did the letter have to be sent to the dispatch room, then to the post office by the messenger, and then sent back by the post office, and then sent upstairs again by the messenger? Speaking of which, it has to do with the Department's huge organization and chaotic work.
    Last year, the State Council instructed state organs to streamline their organizations, but the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry expanded its organizational structure. It is said that this was done to "manage each industry vertically by relevant central ministries." From then on, the original departments, bureaus, and specialized offices were expanded into a "one department, multiple bureaus" system, changing bureaus into all-powerful management agencies, establishing six bureaus, one office, two divisions, and sixty sections, with a total of more than two thousand people.
    As a result, organizational structures overlapped, there were too many redundant personnel, and the scope of business was not clearly defined, leading to mutual buck-passing in work. For example, when the boiler of the Anda Milk Powder Factory broke down, production had to be stopped. The Department of Industry approved the investment in a new boiler, but the comrades of the milk powder factory went all over the Food Bureau, Supply and Marketing Bureau, Construction Division, and Heavy Industry Bureau, and everyone pushed them away. It was not resolved for more than a month. The comrades of the milk powder factory complained: "Everyone is wearing phoenix coronets and ceremonial robes; we don't know who is the empress."
    The excessive number of redundant personnel also limited the enthusiasm of cadres. Some section chiefs in the Food Bureau have not yet been fully assigned, while technical personnel have nothing to do for a long time and have to go to several milk powder factories for inspection. Under the requirements of the all-powerful bureau, the original secretarial section, finance section, etc. in the department were all turned into six sections each. Not only could one person not play the role of two people, but on the contrary, six people were doing the work that one person used to do. It is no wonder that documents in the same building have to travel to the post office.

    从一封信谈起
    去年11月19日在黑龙江省工业厅食品工业局秘书科的办公桌上，放着一封由邮局寄来的信。使人感到奇怪的是发信机关劳动工资科和收信机关同在一个楼上办公，为什么要把信送到收发室，再由通讯员送到邮局，又由邮局送回来，通讯员再送到楼上来呢？说起来，不能不和该厅的机构庞大、工作混乱有关。
    去年国务院指示国家机关要精简机构，黑龙江省工业厅却进行扩大组织机构。据说这是为了中央各部“按行归口，条条管理”而作的。从此，原来的厅、局、专业处扩大为“一厅多局”制，改局为全能管理机构，设立了六个局，一个室、两个处、六十个科，共有两千多人。
    这样一来，组织机构重叠，人浮于事，业务范围划分不清，在工作中互相推诿。例如：安达奶粉厂的锅炉坏了，生产要停产，工业厅批准投资新建锅炉，但奶粉厂的同志走遍了食品局、供销局、基建处、重工业局，都是你推我我推你，一个多月还未解决。奶粉厂的同志埋怨说：“都戴凤冠霞帔，不知谁是正宫娘娘”。
    人浮于事也限制了干部的积极性。食品局有的科科长还没配备全，而技术人员却长期没事干，只好到几个乳粉厂去巡视一趟。原来厅里的秘书科、财务科等在全能局的要求下，每一个科都变为六个科，不但一个人不能发挥两个人的作用，相反的是由六个人做原来一个人的工作了。这就难怪同在一楼办公的文件，要送到邮局去旅行一趟了。
