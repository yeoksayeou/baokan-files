    Delineating the Boundaries Between Thrift and Waste

    The *Shanxi Daily* published an editorial on January 8th entitled "Delineating the Boundaries Between Thrift and Waste," criticizing some industrial enterprises for not first addressing the key issues in production management and financial systems based on their specific characteristics when seeking ways to conserve and plug loopholes of waste. Instead, they started by making plans concerning the welfare of employees. The editorial stated that some enterprise leaders even attempted to use the call for hard work and frugality as a shield for their lack of concern for the well-being of employees and their failure to help employees solve difficulties, saying, "This is great! The Central government is calling for arduous struggle, so we no longer have to fear the masses accusing us of bureaucracy!" The editorial considered this a distortion of the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The editorial stated that caring for the lives of employees and their hardships is a task that should be constantly attended to. In the current large-scale campaign to increase production and practice economy, special attention should be paid to the hardships of employees, because only in this way can the broad masses of employees participate in this movement more actively and enthusiastically. Conversely, only on the basis of the continuous improvement and development of our production can the lives of the working masses be gradually improved. Therefore, the boundary between thrift and waste does not lie in whether money is spent on production or living, but in whether the expenditure is reasonable and necessary. Unreasonable and unnecessary expenditures are wasteful, no matter where they are spent; reasonable and necessary expenditures, no matter where they are, should still be spent if they should be spent, and this should never be called waste. If this boundary is not clearly defined, the campaign to increase production and practice economy cannot be carried out in a healthy and sustainable manner.

    The editorial stated that the focus of increasing production and practicing economy in industrial and mining enterprises is on enterprise management. Any loophole in this area will cause huge waste of state property; and any correct measure in this area will bring about major changes in the production and management of the entire enterprise, creating huge amounts of wealth for the country. The editorial also said: Of course, emphasizing the search for ways to increase production and practice economy from the perspective of production management does not mean that certain extravagant and wasteful phenomena in the area of living welfare can be ignored. The instructions of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily are applicable to all aspects of enterprises. Certain extravagant and wasteful phenomena that currently exist in enterprises must also be corrected. Any tendency to ignore this aspect, or to condone or encourage extravagant and wasteful behavior under the pretext of seeking ways to save on production, is unacceptable.

### 划清节约与浪费的界限

    划清节约与浪费的界限
    山西日报1月8日以“划清节约与浪费的界限”为题发表社论，批评有些工业企业在寻找节约门路和堵塞浪费漏洞的时候，没有首先根据本企业的特点，从生产管理、财务制度中来抓取关键，却首先从职工生活福利方面来打算盘。社论说，有些企业领导干部甚至企图以厉行节约作为他们不关心职工生活疾苦和不帮助职工解决困难的挡箭牌，说什么“这下可好办了，中央提出艰苦奋斗，这就再也不怕群众反我们官僚主义啦！”社论认为这是对党的二中全会的精神的曲解。社论说关心职工生活，关心职工疾苦是一项应当经常注意的工作，在目前开展大规模的增产节约运动中，对职工们的生活疾苦尤其应该特别关心，因为只有这样才能使广大职工更加积极地，热情地参加这一运动。反过来说，也只有在我们的生产不断提高和发展的基础上，职工群众的生活才能逐步得到改善。因此，节约与浪费的界限不在于把钱开支在生产上或生活上，而要看开支的合理不合理、需要不需要。不合理和不需要的开支，无论花在什么地方都是浪费；合理的需要的开支，无论什么地方，该花的还应该花，这绝不能称之为浪费。这个界限如果划不清，增产节约运动就不能够健康地、持续地开展。
    社论说，在工矿企业中开展增产节约的中心是在企业管理方面。在这方面的任何一点漏洞都会给国家财产造成巨大的浪费；而在这方面任何一项正确的措施，都会使整个企业的生产和管理工作发生重大变化，给国家创造巨量的财富。社论又说：当然，强调从生产管理方面寻找增产节约的门路，并不是说对于生活福利方面存在的某些铺张浪费现象就可以不加过问。党的八届二中全会关于勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的指示是适合企业一切方面的。在企业中目前存在着的某些铺张浪费现象同样必须纠正，任何忽视这方面的倾向，或是借口从生产上寻找节约门路而听任或怂恿铺张浪费的行为也是不能容许的。
