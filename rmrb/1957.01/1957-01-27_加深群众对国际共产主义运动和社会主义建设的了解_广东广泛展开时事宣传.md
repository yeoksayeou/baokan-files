To Deepen Public Understanding of the International Communist Movement and Socialist Construction
Guangdong Widely Launches Current Affairs Propaganda
(Our Newspaper News) At present, current affairs propaganda is being widely carried out throughout Guangdong Province. It is expected that before the Spring Festival, all cadres, workers, intellectuals, and residents in more populous towns will have heard a systematic report. After the Spring Festival, this propaganda work will penetrate into every village.

From the 19th onwards, leading cadres of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China began to conduct propaganda among cadres of government organs, senior intellectuals, and young students in Guangzhou. District Mengjue, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, successively made reports on the current situation and on promoting democracy and strengthening the leadership of the Party to党员cadres above the department level in government organs and teachers from eight universities and colleges. Rao Zhangfeng, Head of the United Front Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Kanghua, Head of the Cultural and Education Department, and others also successively made reports to students of the Guangzhou Medical College, Normal College, members of democratic parties, and cadres of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. On the 24th, Zhong Ming, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report on the current situation to cadres above the section level in the city. At the same time, the heads of various departments of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the heads of various departments and bureaus of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee also explained the international and domestic situation to cadres of their respective systems, helping them deepen their understanding of the international communist movement and correctly analyze some local shortcomings and difficulties in the advancement of socialist construction in our country. As of the 24th, more than 50,000 people in Guangzhou had heard the current affairs report.

In addition, the heads of various departments of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee have been regularly reporting to writers, artists, drama workers, musicians, and students of various universities and colleges in the past few days. Cadres of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China will also conduct a systematic current affairs propaganda education for the city's workers and masses.

In the rural areas of Guangdong, large-scale propaganda work on the current situation is also gradually unfolding. The Communist Party committees of many counties have organized reporters to go to the countryside. The Shaoguan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China formed seven reporting groups, which went to various counties from the 18th onwards. The Zhanjiang Special Zone did this propaganda work the earliest and was very popular among the farmers. In Lianjiang County of the Special Zone, there were 125 county and district committee members who made reports, and many party members, members of the Communist Youth League, intellectuals, mountain singers, Cantonese opera and puppet show actors read newspapers, answered questions, and cooperated with performances to the farmers in various places.

Currently, 50,000 middle school students in Guangzhou have begun their winter vacation, and they have decided to make propaganda of the current situation as the main activity during the winter vacation.

    广东广泛展开时事宣传
    本报讯　目前广东全省范围的时事宣传工作正在广泛展开。预计春节以前，在人口较多的城镇中，所有干部、职工、知识分子和居民都将听到一次系统的报告。春节以后，这一宣传工作将深入到每一乡村中去。
    从19日起，中共广东省委员会的一些负责干部开始在广州市的机关干部、高级知识分子以及青年学生中进行宣传。省委书记区梦觉先后向机关处级以上党员干部和八所高等学校的教师作了关于目前形势以及关于发扬民主与加强党的领导的报告。省委统战部长饶彰风、文教部长杨康华等也先后向广州医学院、师范专科学校的学生、民主党派人士、工商联干部等作了报告。24日，中共广州市委员会书记钟明又向全市科级以上干部作了目前形势的报告。同时，中共广东省委各部负责人和广东省人民委员会各厅局负责人也分别向所属系统的干部讲解国际国内的形势，帮助干部加深有关国际共产主义运动的了解，正确地分析我国社会主义建设前进中的一些局部性的缺点和困难。到24日为止，广州市听过时事报告的已达五万人以上。
    此外，中共广东省委各部的负责人都已定期在这几天向作家、美术工作者、戏剧工作者、音乐工作者和各高等学校的学生分别作报告。中共广州市委的干部也将向全市职工群众进行一次系统的时事宣传教育。
    在广东农村，大规模宣传当前形势的工作也正在逐步展开。许多县的中共委员会已纷纷组织报告员下乡。中共韶关地委组成了七个报告团，在18日起分赴各县。湛江专区这次宣传工作做得最早，并且很受农民欢迎。该专区廉江县作报告的县委、区委委员有一百二十五名，还有许多名党员、团员、知识分子、山歌手、粤剧和木偶戏演员分别在各地向农民读报、解答问题和配合演出。
    目前广州市已有五万中学生开始放寒假，他们已确定把宣传目前形势作为寒假中的主要活动。
