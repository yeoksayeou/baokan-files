	A Brief Discussion on the Relationship Between Right and Wrong
	——Notes on Studying the "Eighth National Congress" Documents
	Sha Ying (I)
	Anyone with some philosophical common sense knows that everything contains contradictions, and the development process of everything involves the movement of contradictions from beginning to end. It is precisely due to the mutual dependence and mutual struggle of internal contradictions that the development of everything is promoted. Without the emergence and overcoming of contradictions, there can be no development. Changes in nature and society are mainly due to the development of contradictions within nature and society. Contradictions are ubiquitous, and there is nothing that does not contain contradictions. Without contradictions, there would be no development of the human world. However, the contradictions of various things also have their own particularities, and this particularity constitutes the special essence that distinguishes one thing from another. Different types of contradictions must be resolved with different types of methods. The reason we pay special attention to studying dialectical materialism is mainly to learn to observe and analyze the contradictions of various things, and based on this analysis, find appropriate methods for resolving contradictions.
	Within our Communist Party, there are also contradictions. These contradictions are generated by a specific social environment and class struggle in society, and are reflections of social and class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within the Party. Our Party is developing and consolidating itself in the process of constantly overcoming various contradictions within the Party. However, contradictions within the Party also have their own particularities. These contradictions are mainly ideological contradictions, that is, contradictions between correct ideas and incorrect ideas. The method for resolving these ideological contradictions is criticism and self-criticism and the method of rectification, which is the method of ideological struggle. Conducting struggle within the Party is mainly ideological struggle. Although ideological differences may develop into political differences, and in some cases even organizational differences within the Party, its essence and basic content are still ideological struggle. Ideological struggle is to achieve ideological unity based on Marxism. Only with ideological unity can we maintain and strengthen the Party's political, organizational, and action unity, thereby consolidating the Party's solidarity. There are often contradictions between right and wrong and ideological struggles within the Party, and it is this ideological struggle that drives the Party forward. This is a general dialectical regularity in the development of a proletarian political party. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If there are no contradictions and no ideological struggle to resolve contradictions within the Party, the life of the Party will also cease." ("On Contradiction") Therefore, we should not cover up the contradictions within the Party, nor should we be afraid of criticism and self-criticism, nor should we be afraid of internal Party struggles. At the same time, in the Party's internal struggle, that is, in the struggle between correct ideas and wrong ideas, correct views and wrong views, and sometimes even in the struggle between correct lines and wrong lines, there are always comrades who make mistakes, and sometimes there are comrades who make serious mistakes or even line mistakes. This is not surprising. However, in order to educate comrades, strengthen the Party's unity, and improve the Party's combat effectiveness, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between right and wrong within the Party, and it is necessary to have a correct policy towards comrades who have made mistakes. This is one of the necessary conditions for the Party to maintain correct leadership. Therefore, studying the issue of right and wrong within the Party is not only very meaningful for Party building; but also, because our Party is now the ruling party, whether or not it can correctly handle the issue of right and wrong within the Party has a major impact on all aspects of the country's life and construction. In particular, many of our Party members are new members who joined the Party not long after liberation. They are not very familiar with or accustomed to ideological struggles within the Party, and they do not have a deep understanding of the valuable experience our Party has gained in this regard. Therefore, studying this issue is even more practically significant.
	
		(II)
	The general program of the new Party Constitution states: "No political party or individual can be without shortcomings and mistakes in its activities." The article "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" also pointed out that no Marxist representative has ever said in any work that we will never make mistakes, or that a certain Communist Party member will absolutely never make mistakes. Nor can it be imagined that having made certain mistakes in the initial stage will inevitably and forever prevent us from making certain other mistakes, and that we will not inevitably repeat the original mistakes to a greater or lesser extent. The fact is indeed the case, there are no "supermen" who will not make mistakes, big or small, in the world. Unless they are like the Bodhisattvas in the temple who do not work, as long as they work, especially when doing new and arduous work of transforming the world, it is always possible to make mistakes, big or small. Although the Chinese Communist Party has done earth-shattering work and achieved brilliant results, we have also made some serious mistakes in history, and we may still make mistakes in the future. From the issue of criticizing Stalin, we can also see that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin also made serious mistakes. However, the Communist Party has a significant characteristic compared to bourgeois political parties, that is, it never covers up its mistakes, but can bravely and unequivocally expose and acknowledge its mistakes, and resolutely and sincerely correct the mistakes it has made. This is one of the reasons why we have been victorious. However, any political party and political group that serves the exploiting classes does not dare to seriously admit its mistakes in front of the masses. This is one of the reasons for their demise.
	Why do people make mistakes? To put it specifically, there are many reasons for making mistakes. In the face of extremely complex, tortuous, and ever-changing objective situations, some people may make mistakes due to insufficient experience and various limitations; some people may become arrogant and complacent due to some achievements in their work, and therefore may also make mistakes; some people may easily make various mistakes, big or small, due to ideological consciousness, personality, and character flaws, such as selfish individualism, the pursuit of fame and position, liberalism, moral defects, and rudeness in character. However, generally speaking, the fundamental reason why people make mistakes is mostly due to subjectivism in ideological understanding. Subjectivism means not proceeding from reality, not conducting detailed investigations and studies of the surrounding environment, not understanding the laws of objective things, and only acting based on subjective wishes, enthusiasm, or feelings, sometimes treating the partial as the whole, treating the local as the overall, or absolutizing the problem. Therefore, subjective understanding is inconsistent with the objective situation, and the results of practice do not achieve the expected goals, so things are done badly. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report at the Eighth National Congress: "If a person does not understand that correct opinions can only be an objective and comprehensive reflection of actual things, and insists on acting according to his own subjective and one-sided ideas, then even if he has all the good intentions, he will still make mistakes, big or small." This is the case for a political party, a department, and a leader. As long as their subjective understanding is inconsistent with the objective situation, their thinking does not conform to the laws of the external world, their theory is divorced from practice, their leadership is divorced from the masses, and they do not "seek truth from facts" but "are self-righteous," then they will inevitably make various mistakes, big or small. For example, if understanding lags behind the objective reality, insufficient estimates are made of objective conditions in work, insufficient estimates are made of the masses' awareness and enthusiasm, leadership lags behind the masses, various potential forces are not seen, and the growth of new things is hindered, then right-leaning conservatism will occur; if understanding does not conform to the objective situation and possible conditions are not considered, and subjective plans exceed the masses' awareness, then "left"-leaning adventurism will occur. The ideological root cause of the mistakes of right-leaning and "left"-leaning opportunist lines that our Party has made in the past lies in their subjectivism. The reason why Stalin made some serious mistakes in his later work was also due to his ideological subjectivism, which led to one-sidedness, detachment from reality, and detachment from the masses, resulting in adverse consequences.
	Of course, mistakes often have social roots. Our Party and the proletariat have often been surrounded by various non-proletarian classes (bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie, peasants, etc.) in the past, and the ideological sentiments of other classes often influenced the Party and the proletariat. This is the social root of various mistakes within the Party. Intra-Party struggle is often a reflection of class struggle outside the Party. In particular, old China was a country with an extremely large petty bourgeoisie, and the majority of Party members were of petty-bourgeois origin. Therefore, the ideological sentiments of this class often influenced us and constantly put pressure on us. The "left"-leaning line mistakes that our Party has made in the past are actually a reflection of this petty-bourgeois ideological sentiment. The "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues" stated: "The phenomena of ideological subjectivism, political 'left' and right deviations, and organizational sectarianism that have occurred in our Party in the past, whether or not they have formed a line or controlled leadership, are obviously manifestations of petty-bourgeois ideology against Marxism-Leninism and against the proletariat." Now, due to the victorious progress of the socialist revolution, the class relations in our country have undergone fundamental changes. However, class struggle will continue to exist until the socialist transformation is completed. Even after the socialist transformation is completed, all non-proletarian classes will be eliminated. However, the positions, viewpoints, and ideological sentiments of various non-proletarian classes, especially the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, will continue for a long period of time, and they will continue to influence our Party and the proletariat from all aspects. This old traditional ideology is a huge conservative force, and the force of habit of hundreds of millions of people is the most terrible force. If we do not wage a resolute struggle against this traditional ideology and force of habit, we will easily be influenced by it and make mistakes.
	Of course, our enemies, all the reactionary forces in the world, are gloating over any mistakes made by the Communist Parties of any country. They not only ridicule our mistakes, but also try their best to use our mistakes to engage in sinful activities. But they will always fail. Because the dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the majority over the minority, and it is far superior to the dictatorship of the exploiting classes. With the victorious progress of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the level of the people's material and cultural life will continue to improve, and the free and democratic life will be increasingly expanded. The consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses will be fully developed, which makes it possible for us to overcome the mistakes we have made. In this regard, Lenin said in "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back": "They (referring to our enemies - translator's note) see us arguing and gloat, become complacent;... But the Russian Social Democrats have long experienced battles and endured hardships, and will not be frightened by these mere pinpricks, but can continue their self-criticism work regardless of these pinpricks, ruthlessly exposing their shortcomings, which are certain and inevitable to be overcome due to the development of the workers' movement."
		(III)
	Since there are always issues of right and wrong within the Party, and there are always comrades who make mistakes, then how should we treat the issues of right and wrong, and how should we treat comrades who make mistakes?
	There are two attitudes towards the issues of right and wrong within the Party and towards comrades who make mistakes: one attitude is to know that the mistakes within the Party are wrong, but not to argue, not to speak out in person, but to spread rumors behind the back; or because the person who made the mistake is a good friend or old subordinate, they only mention it lightly, not hurting feelings, and adopt a laissez-faire, tolerant, or even protective attitude; or because the person who made the mistake is an "authoritative" figure or their superior, they adopt an attitude of self-preservation and saying as little as possible due to concerns about gains and losses, and some even engage in personal worship, echo what others say, and fawn on them. This is a vulgar and liberal attitude lacking principles. The other attitude is to carry out excessive struggle against the shortcomings and mistakes within the Party, not paying attention to proportions, thinking that the "fiercer the struggle" against comrades who have made mistakes, the "heavier the problem" is, raising any small shortcomings and small mistakes to the so-called "height of principle," and attaching "big hats" of various names, and abusing organizational means to solve problems with punitive methods, even not hesitating to treat comrades with the means of external Party struggle, simply making them feel ashamed, just like the fake foreign devil in "The True Story of Ah Q," not allowing them to make revolution. During the period when the "left"-leaning opportunist line ruled our Party, especially the representatives of the third "left"-leaning line, carried out such excessive struggles. In order to implement their erroneous line, they erroneously labeled all comrades who took a skeptical, dissatisfied, or not resolute attitude towards their erroneous line, regardless of their circumstances, with various big hats such as "line" and "ism," and subjected them to "cruel struggle" and "ruthless blows," even using the method of struggling against criminals and enemies to carry out "intra-Party struggle." (See "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues") This erroneous intra-Party struggle is a manifestation of sectarianism.
	Those who adopt a liberal and conciliatory attitude towards the issues of right and wrong within the Party are actually covering up the contradictions within the Party, canceling criticism and self-criticism, negating the struggle within the Party, preventing the shortcomings and mistakes within the Party from being corrected in time, and stagnating the Party's development. Those who adopt an excessive struggle against the mistakes within the Party are ignoring the particularity of intra-Party contradictions, have a mechanical understanding of intra-Party struggle, are not focusing on solving problems ideologically, but are focusing on solving problems organizationally, and as a result, they are negating intra-Party democracy, harming the due harmony within the Party, destroying the personality, initiative, and enthusiasm of Party members, creating a situation of unclear right and wrong and lifelessness within the Party, and causing losses to the Party's cause. We must oppose both of these attitudes. At present, these two tendencies still exist in some organizations of our Party, especially many Party organizations still have the punitive tendency of excessive and heavy punishments for Party members. Although this is not the main tendency in the Party today, it is also worth our attention and correction.
	First of all, we must strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions with different natures: the relationship between right and wrong within the Party and the relationship between the enemy and ourselves. The relationship between the enemy and ourselves is an irreconcilable antagonistic contradiction, and its basis is the conflict of interests between hostile classes. For revolutionary enemies, we can use methods such as mass demonstrations, strikes, and even armed struggle to resolve them according to the circumstances; but the relationship between right and wrong within the Party is a non-antagonistic contradiction, which is the contradiction between correct opinions and wrong opinions. The basic method for resolving this contradiction is criticism and self-criticism, and intra-Party struggle is essentially an ideological struggle. If we use the method of struggling against the enemy to resolve the issues of right and wrong within the Party, and treat comrades who have made mistakes with the means of struggling against the enemy, it will inevitably cause serious bad consequences. Of course, contradictions within the Party may also deteriorate and may develop into antagonistic contradictions. But in general, as long as there is a correct policy on the issues of right and wrong within the Party, and correct treatment is given to comrades who have made mistakes, and the person who has made a mistake does not persist in the mistake, this kind of contradiction within the Party will not develop into an antagonistic contradiction. We must never use the method of struggling against the enemy to resolve the contradictions within the Party, never confuse the struggle against the enemy with the struggle within the Party, and never expand these two struggles. Of course, for counter-revolutionary elements who have sneaked into the Party, and for class alien elements who are carrying out sabotage activities within the Party, we must resolutely remove them.
	Secondly, the issues of right and wrong within the Party should be specifically analyzed according to the specific circumstances. When there is a dispute of different opinions within the Party, what do we support and what do we oppose? This can only be analyzed from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, and the truth must be thoroughly clarified with a realistic attitude. After clarifying the truth, we must adhere to principles, adhere to the truth, stand on the correct side without hesitation to oppose and criticize the wrong side, and help the wrong side to correct its mistakes. Even the mistakes of comrades who have made mistakes should be specifically analyzed. On the one hand, a correct assessment should be made of the circumstances of his mistake, the nature of the mistake, the size of the mistake, whether it was conscious or unconscious, whether it was a first offense or a repeated offense, etc.; on the other hand, a correct assessment should also be made of the correct parts of the comrades who have made mistakes, as well as their achievements and advantages. We cannot absolutize the problem, thinking that comrades who have made mistakes are all wrong and cannot have correct parts, and therefore deny everything. Only by making a comprehensive observation of the positive and negative aspects, merits and demerits of comrades who have made mistakes can a correct assessment be made. For example, when our Party criticized the mistakes of the various "left"-leaning lines, it did not say that they were all wrong, and still pointed out that their views on issues such as anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, the land revolution, and the anti-Chiang war were still consistent with those of comrades who advocated the correct line. For example, the analysis of Stalin's mistakes and the estimation of his merits and demerits are very clear and correct in the two articles "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" and "Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," and they have also set a concrete example for us.
	Thirdly, the handling of mistakes within the Party should adopt a policy of treating them differently according to different circumstances and different handling methods. "For those who intentionally undermine Party unity, confront the Party, persist in not correcting their mistakes, or even engage in sectarian activities, splitting activities, and other harmful activities within the Party, the Party must conduct a ruthless struggle, give them strict sanctions, and even expel them from the Party when necessary." (See the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee) Everyone knows that in 1927, our Party conducted a struggle against the traitor Chen Duxiu and cleared out these elements. In 1935, during the Long March of the Red Army, the Party smashed Zhang Guotao's conspiracy to split the Party, thereby successfully completing the great Long March. Not long ago, we smashed the Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance, which was engaged in extensive conspiracy activities and attempted to seize the supreme power of the Party and the state, greatly strengthening the Party's unity. This is of great significance for safeguarding the interests of the revolution and the interests of the people. Everyone also knows that our Party has not relaxed its efforts against those who violate laws and discipline, are corrupt and degenerate, and are incorrigible. Once they are discovered, they are dealt with seriously, even to the point of being expelled from the Party. I don't think it is necessary to give many examples of this kind. However, under normal circumstances, we treat comrades who make mistakes in their work due to mistakes in understanding with the principles of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the disease to save the patient" and "clarifying ideology and uniting comrades," focusing on ideological education and not easily making disciplinary actions. According to what has been discussed above, most of the mistakes of many comrades in their work are due to subjective understanding, so the main way to correct them is to strengthen ideological education, improve the level of awareness of these comrades, so that they will not repeat the mistakes of the past in the future, and continue to unite them to work for the Party; at the same time, the purpose of doing so is also to enable other comrades to learn a lesson, learn from it, and do a good job in the future. Therefore, the attitude and method that we should adopt towards comrades who have made mistakes is to look on the one hand and help on the other hand; to protect on the one hand and criticize on the other hand. That is to say, we must see whether he admits his mistake and whether he is willing to truly correct his mistake in action; at the same time, we must actively help him, care for him in many ways, and urge him to correct his mistake. We must first protect comrades who have made mistakes, and we should not carry out excessive struggles and blows against them, nor should we despise and discriminate against them; but at the same time, we must expose and criticize his mistakes, explain the content, nature, causes, and harms of the mistakes, and point out the ways to correct them. This is concrete help. The way of this kind of criticism should be as gentle as possible; the purpose of this kind of criticism is to unite comrades and protect comrades. Of course, for comrades who have made serious mistakes, such as violating state laws, violating Party resolutions, violating Party discipline, etc., they should also be given due disciplinary action, and a protective and tolerant attitude must never be adopted; but even if they are given disciplinary action, we must still patiently help them recognize and correct their mistakes so that they can continue to work for the Party. In this regard, the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee pointed out: "For those comrades who have shortcomings that are not very important in nature or who have made mistakes that are not very important in nature, or for those who have serious or relatively serious shortcomings and have made serious or relatively serious mistakes, but who can still put the interests of the Party above their personal interests after being criticized and educated, and are willing to correct and implement the correction, we should adopt the policy of 'being kind to people' and 'curing the disease to save the patient.' Their shortcomings or mistakes must be seriously criticized or necessary struggles must be carried out in accordance with the specific circumstances; but this criticism or struggle should implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong: 'Starting from unity, reaching the goal of unity through criticism or struggle,' we should not fail to give them the opportunity to correct, let alone deliberately exaggerate their individual, partial, temporary, and relatively unimportant shortcomings or mistakes into systematic and serious shortcomings or mistakes, because this attitude is not starting from unity, cannot achieve the goal of unity, and is not conducive to the Party."
		(IV)
	Is it correct for us to adopt such a policy and attitude towards mistakes within the Party? First of all, this policy of ours is formulated based on Lenin's teachings. Lenin once said: "Openly admitting mistakes, exposing the causes of mistakes, analyzing the environment in which mistakes occur, and carefully discussing methods of correcting mistakes - this is the sign of a solemn party, this is the party fulfilling its obligations, and this is educating and training the class, and even the masses." ("'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder") There are many examples in the history of our Party of implementing this policy. For example, in the document "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," Comrade Mao Zedong criticized the various non-proletarian erroneous ideological manifestations in the Party at that time, and proposed methods of correction, which solved many basic problems in Party building and army building. This is an example of conducting a concrete analysis of mistakes within the Party. For example, in the document "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues," the analysis of the various erroneous lines that occurred in the history of our Party, especially the three "left"-leaning erroneous lines from the beginning of 1931 to the end of 1934, not only pointed out the environment in which the various erroneous lines (especially the third "left"-leaning line) were produced, the nature and main content of the errors, and the ideological roots and social historical roots that produced these errors, but also pointed out the ways to overcome the "left" and right-leaning errors and the attitude towards the errors within the Party. It is truly seeking truth from facts, reasonable, and can help people clarify their thinking so as to learn lessons from the mistakes they have made in the past, and can also adopt a cautious attitude and a generous policy towards comrades who have made mistakes in order to achieve the goal of uniting comrades to work together. This is another example of conducting a concrete analysis of mistakes within the Party. The policy we have adopted towards errors within the Party is more clearly manifested in the rectification movements of the past, especially in the great rectification movement in 1942. The rectification movement is a form of intra-Party struggle adopted by our Party, that is, under the unified leadership of the Party, on the one hand, studying relevant documents of Marxism-Leninism and Party documents, and on the other hand, discussing historical issues of the Party and examining errors within the Party, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, thereby guiding cadres and Party members to the path of ideological and political consciousness, so as to achieve the goal of "adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes." As a result, this rectification movement profoundly changed the face of our Party, not only improved the ideological level of the entire Party, rescued many comrades, but also greatly enhanced the Party's unity. It should be said that the policy and methods we have adopted towards errors within the Party are a creative development of Marxism-Leninism on the issue of Party building.
	Secondly, judging from the experience of our Party since 1935 in consistently adopting this policy and method towards comrades who have made mistakes, practice has proved that it is completely correct. Because many comrades who have made mistakes have straightened out their thinking and corrected their mistakes under this policy, after the Party's patient persuasion and education, and have done beneficial work for the Party, making the Party more united and prosperous. Here we can give a prominent example. Why is everyone so interested in Comrade Li Lisan's speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Party? This is because his speech vividly proved the correctness of our Party's policy. Everyone knows that Comrade Li Lisan once made serious line mistakes. He was responsible for the erroneous Second "Left" Opportunist Line, the Li Lisan Line, and was an active participant in the First "Left" Opportunist Line. However, under the education and help of the Party, he reviewed the mistakes he had made, realized that the root cause of the mistakes was subjectivism, continued to work for the Party, and deeply realized the correctness of the Party's policy from the lessons of his mistakes. In his speech, he said: When the Central Committee discovered the mistakes he had made in his work in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in 1950, it made timely exposure and sharp criticism, and raised it to the level of Marxist-Leninist principles to explain the essence of the mistakes and criticize the harmfulness of the mistakes, which helped him to realize it more quickly. "In the process of checking my mistakes and after reviewing my mistakes, the Central Committee and many responsible comrades cared for me like a doctor taking care of a patient, and gave me the opportunity to correct my mistakes in my work. Many comrades I came into contact with not only did not discriminate against me, but also gave me a lot of comrades' help, comfort, and encouragement. I deeply felt the warmth of this kind of comrade. This kind of care and warmth is just like a tonic after illness, enabling me to recover my health and work ability more quickly." These words are indeed touching and full of educational significance, and also specifically embody the success and greatness of the Party's policy.
	Now our fundamental task is to build socialism. In order to realize this great task, strengthening the Party's leadership is a decisive condition. In order to correctly handle the issues of right and wrong within the Party, we should implement this correct policy and make the Party more united and stronger. This is one of the necessary conditions for the Party to maintain correct leadership.
	In fact, not only is there this kind of relationship between right and wrong within the Communist Party, but also within the democratic parties, state power, and people's organizations, there are issues of right and wrong, there are ideological struggles, criticism and self-criticism must be carried out, and people often make mistakes. In order to turn all negative factors into positive factors, and in order to unite all possible forces to build socialism, the issues of right and wrong and comrades who have made mistakes must also be handled correctly. Of course, the specific handling situations are not entirely the same as within the Party. However, "contradictions among the people can and should be resolved from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, so as to obtain new unity under new conditions." ("Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship") From this, it can be seen that studying the issue of right and wrong is of great significance not only for Party building but also for the country's socialist construction.

    略论是非关系
    ——学习“八大”文件的笔记
    沙英	（一）
      凡是有些哲学常识的人都知道，一切事物中都包含有矛盾，一切事物的发展过程都存在着
  自始至终的矛盾运动。正是由于内部矛盾方面的相互依赖和相互斗争，才推动着一切事物的发展。没有矛盾的产生和克服，便不可能有发展。自然界的变化和社会的变化，主要地都是由于自然界内部和社会内部矛盾的发展。矛盾是普遍存在的，没有什么事物是不包含矛盾的，没有矛盾就没有人类世界的发展。但是各种事物的矛盾又都有它的特殊性，这种矛盾的特殊性，构成了此一事物区别于彼一事物的特殊的本质。不同质的矛盾，要用不同质的方法去解决。我们所以要特别注意学习唯物辩证法，主要地就是学习观察和分析各种事物的矛盾，并根据这种分析，找出解决矛盾的妥善的方法。
    在我们共产党内，同样是有矛盾的，这种矛盾是由一定的社会环境和社会中的阶级斗争而产生的，是社会的阶级的矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映；我们党正是在不断克服党内各种矛盾的过程中发展和巩固起来的。不过党内的矛盾同样亦有它的特殊性，这种矛盾主要地是思想的矛盾，即正确思想与错误思想的矛盾。解决这种思想矛盾的方法，是用批评与自我批评和整风的方法，是用思想斗争的方法。进行党内斗争，主要的是思想斗争。虽然由于思想原则的分歧可能发展到政治上的分歧，在某种情况下甚至可能发展到党内组织上的分歧，但是它的实质，它的基本内容还是一种思想斗争。思想斗争是为了取得马克思主义的思想上的一致，只有在思想上一致，才能保持和加强党内政治上、组织上和行动的一致，从而巩固党的团结。在党内经常是有是非的矛盾和思想斗争的，正是这种思想斗争推动着党的前进。这是无产阶级政党发展中的一般辩证的规律性。毛泽东同志说：“党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”（“矛盾论”）因此，我们不要掩饰党内的矛盾，不要惧怕批评与自我批评，不要惧怕党内斗争。同时在党内斗争中，即在正确思想和错误思想、正确的主张和错误的主张的斗争中，有时甚至在正确路线和错误路线的斗争中，总经常有犯错误的同志，有时也会有犯严重错误以至犯路线错误的同志。这是没有什么奇怪的。不过，为了教育同志，为了加强党的团结和统一，为了提高党的战斗力，需要对党内的是非关系加以妥善的处理，需要对犯错误的同志有正确的方针。这是使党能保持正确领导的必要条件之一。因此，研究党内的是非问题，不仅对于党的建设是很有意义的；而且由于我们的党现在是执政的党，能不能正确处理党内的是非问题，对国家各方面的生活和建设都有重大的影响。特别是目前我们党的党员许多都是解放后入党不久的，他们对党内的思想斗争是不大熟悉、不大习惯的，对我们党在这方面所获得的宝贵经验是体会不深的，因此研究这个问题就更具有现实意义了。
              （二）
    在新党章的总纲中写道：“任何政党和任何个人在自己的活动中都不会是没有缺点和错误的。”在“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文中也曾指出：马克思主义的代表人物在什么著作中也没有说过我们是永远不会犯错误的，或者曾经说过某一个共产党人是绝对不会犯错误的。也不可能设想：初期有过某些错误，就将命定地永远不会再犯某些其他的错误，而且命定地不会或多或少地再犯原来有过的错误。事实的确如此，世界上是没有不会犯或大或小的错误的“神人”存在的，除了他像庙里的菩萨似的不做工作，只要做工作，特别是做改造世界这样新奇而艰难的工作，总有可能犯或大或小的错误。我们中国共产党虽然做了惊天动地的事业，并且取得了光辉灿烂的成果，但是在历史上我们也曾犯过一些严重的错误，今后我们还是可能犯错误的。从批评斯大林的问题中我们也可以看到，苏联共产党和斯大林也都犯过严重的错误。不过共产党比起资产阶级的政党有一个显著的特点，就是它从不掩饰自己的错误，而能勇敢地毫不含糊地揭发和承认自己的错误，并坚决而诚恳地改正所犯的错误。这是我们所以胜利的原因之一。可是任何一个为剥削阶级服务的政党和政治集团，都是不敢在群众面前认真承认错误的。这是它们灭亡的原因之一。
    人为什么会犯错误呢？如果具体地说来，犯错误的原因是有多种多样的。在异常复杂曲折而变化多端的客观情况下面，有的人由于经验不够和各种条件的限制可能犯错误；有的人由于在工作中得到了一些成绩，骄傲自满起来，也就可能犯错误；有的人由于思想意识、性格和品质上的毛病，例如有自私自利的个人主义、名位观念、自由主义、道德上的缺陷和性格上的粗暴等等，也就极容易犯各种各样或大或小的错误。但是一般地说起来，人们所以犯错误的根本原因，大都是由于思想认识上的主观主义。主观主义就是不从实际出发，对周围的环境不作精细的调查研究，不了解客观事物的规律性，只根据主观的愿望、热情或感想去办事，有时把片面当成全面，把局部当成全体，或者把问题绝对化，因此主观的认识和客观的情况不相一致，实践的结果达不到预想的目的，所以把事情做坏了。刘少奇同志在“八大”的政治报告中说道：“一个人如果不懂得正确的意见只能是对于实际事物的客观的全面的反映，而坚持要按自己的主观的片面的想法去办事，那末，即使他有一切善良的动机，也还是会犯或大或小的错误。”不论一个政党、一个部门、一个领导人都是这样，只要它的主观与客观不一致，思想不合于外界的规律性，理论和实际脱节，领导和群众脱离，不是“实事求是”，而是“自以为是”，那便必然要犯各种各样或大或小的错误。例如说，如果认识落后于客观的实际，在工作中对客观的条件估计不足，对群众的觉悟性和积极性估计不足，领导落后于群众，看不见各种潜在力量，阻碍了新鲜事物的成长，便会发生右倾保守主义的错误；如果认识不符合客观的情况，不考虑可能的条件，主观的计划超过了群众的觉悟，便会发生“左”倾冒进的错误。我们党在过去曾发生几次右倾和“左”倾机会主义路线的错误，其思想根源都在于它们的主观主义。斯大林在他后一个时期的工作中所以犯了某些严重的错误，也是由于他思想上的主观主义，产生了片面性，脱离了实际，脱离了群众，所以造成了不良的后果。
    当然，错误在很多情况下是有社会根源的。我们党和无产阶级过去经常处在各种非无产阶级（资产阶级、小资产阶级、农民等）的包围之中，其他各种阶级的思想情绪经常影响着党和无产阶级。这就是党内各种错误的社会根源。党内斗争往往是党外阶级斗争的反映。特别是旧中国是一个小资产阶级极其广大的国家，党内小资产阶级出身的分子也占大多数，因此这个阶级的思想情绪就经常影响我们，不断地给我们以压力。我党过去所犯的几次“左”倾路线的错误，实际上就是这种小资产阶级思想情绪的反映。在“关于若干历史问题的决议”中曾写道：“我们党内历次发生的思想上的主观主义，政治上的‘左’右倾，组织上的宗派主义等项现象，无论其是否形成了路线，掌握了领导，显然都是小资产阶级思想之反马克思列宁主义、反无产阶级的表现。”现在，由于社会主义革命的胜利进展，我国的阶级关系已发生了根本的变化，但是在社会主义改造完成以前，阶级斗争依然继续存在着。就是在社会主义改造完成以后，各种非无产阶级都消灭了，但是各种非无产阶级的、特别是资产阶级和小资产阶级的立场、观点和思想情绪还会继续一个很长的时期，它们还会继续从各方面来影响我们的党和无产阶级。这种旧的传统思想是一种巨大的保守力量，千百万人的习惯势力是一种最可怕的势力，如不与这种传统思想和习惯势力作坚决的斗争，就容易使我们受到它的影响而犯错误。
    当然，我们的敌人，世界上一切的反动势力，对于任何国家的共产党不论犯的什么错误都是幸灾乐祸的。他们不仅讥笑我们的错误，而且想尽办法利用我们的错误从事罪恶的活动。但是他们总是要失败的。因为无产阶级专政是多数人对少数人的专政，和剥削阶级的专政比起来不知优越多少倍。随着无产阶级专政胜利的进展，人民物质文化生活的水平不断提高，自由的民主的生活日益扩展，人民群众的觉悟性和积极性将有充分的发挥，这就使得我们有可能克服所犯的错误。对此，列宁在“进一步，退两步”一书中说过：“他们（指我们的敌人——引者）看见我们争论，就幸灾乐祸，洋洋得意起来；……可是，俄国社会民主党人已久历战斗，饱受风霜，决不会为这区区针刺所惊吓，却能够不顾这些针刺而依然继续其自我批评的工作，无情揭露自己的缺点，这些缺点是一定和必然会因工人运动发展而被克服的。”		（三）
    既然党内总有是非问题存在，并且总经常有犯错误的同志，那末，我们应当怎样对待是非问题，怎样对待犯错误的同志呢？
    对待党内的是非问题、对于犯错误的同志有这样两种态度：一种态度是对党内的错误明知不对、也不争论，当面不说、背后乱说；或者因为犯错误的人是好朋友、老部下，所以只轻描淡写地说一下，不伤和气，采取姑息、纵容甚至包庇的态度；或者因为犯错误的人是“权威”人物、自己的上司，由于患得患失，采取明哲保身、少说为佳的态度，有的甚至个人崇拜、随声附和、曲意逢迎。这是一种缺乏原则性的庸俗的自由主义的态度。另一种态度是对党内的缺点和错误实行过火的斗争，不讲求分寸，以为对犯错误的同志斗争得“愈凶愈好”，把问题提得“愈重愈好”，不论什么小缺点小错误都提到所谓“原则的高度”，扣上各种名称的“大帽子”，而且滥用组织手段，以惩办方法去解决问题，甚至不惜用党外斗争的手段去对待同志，简直弄得人家无地自容，就像“阿Q正传”中的假洋鬼子一样，不准人家革命。在“左”倾机会主义路线统治我们党的时期，尤其是第三次“左”倾路线的代表者，就实行过这样过火的斗争，他们为了贯彻其错误的路线起见，在党内曾经把一切对他们的错误路线采取怀疑、不满意、不坚决执行的同志，不问其情况如何，一律错误地戴上什么“路线”什么“主义”等各种各样的大帽子，而加以“残酷斗争”和“无情打击”，甚至以对罪犯和敌人作斗争的方式来进行“党内斗争”。（见关于若干历史问题的决议”）这种错误的党内斗争，乃是一种宗派主义的表现。
    对党内是非问题采取自由主义和调和主义态度的人，实际上是掩盖党内的矛盾，取消批评和自我批评，否定党内的斗争，使党内的缺点和错误不能及时得到纠正，使党的发展停滞起来。对党内错误采取过火斗争的人，是忽视党内矛盾的特殊性，对党内斗争作机械的了解，不是着重从思想上去解决问题，而是着重从组织上去解决问题，结果是否定了党内的民主，伤害了党内应有的和睦，摧残了党员的个性、主动性和积极性，造成了党内是非不明，死气沉沉的状况，使党的事业受到损失。这两种态度我们都是要反对的。目前在我们党的某些组织中也还存在着这两种倾向，特别是不少党的组织还有对党员处分过多过重的惩办主义倾向，虽然这不是党内当前主要的倾向，但也值得我们注意加以纠正。
    首先，我们一定要把党内的是非关系和敌我关系这两种性质不同的矛盾加以严格的区别。敌我关系是一种不可调和的对抗性的矛盾，它的基础是敌对阶级之间的利害冲突。对于革命的敌人，我们可以根据情况用群众的游行示威、罢工罢课以至武装斗争等方式去解决；但是党内的是非关系是一种非对抗性的矛盾，是正确意见和错误意见的矛盾，解决这种矛盾的基本方法是批评与自我批评，党内斗争在实质上是一种思想斗争。如果用对敌斗争的方法来解决党内的是非问题，以对敌斗争的手段对待犯错误的同志，便必然造成严重的恶果。当然，党内的矛盾也可能变质，也可能发展成为对抗性的矛盾。但是在一般情况下面，只要对党内的是非问题有正确的方针，对犯错误的同志作正确的处理，犯错误的人也不坚持错误，这种党内的矛盾不至于发展为对抗性的矛盾。我们绝不能用对敌斗争的方法来解决党内的矛盾，绝不能将对敌斗争和党内斗争混淆起来，也绝不能将这两种斗争扩大化。当然，对于混进党内的反革命分子、对于在党内进行破坏活动的阶级异己分子，我们要坚决地把他们清除出去。
    其次，对党内的是非问题应根据具体情况进行具体分析。当党内有不同意见的争论的时候，究竟我们赞成什么和反对什么呢？这只有以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法去进行分析，以实事求是的态度彻底弄清是非。在弄清是非之后，我们就要坚持原则，坚持真理，毫不犹疑地站在正确的方面去反对和批判错误的方面，并帮助错误的方面改正错误。就是对犯错误的同志的错误也要进行具体分析，一方面对他犯错误的环境、错误的性质、错误的大小、是自觉还是不自觉，是初犯还是屡犯等等情况都要作正确的估计；另一方面也要对犯错误的同志的正确的部分以及他的成绩和优点等要作正确的估计。我们不能把问题看得绝对化，认为犯错误的同志什么都错了，不可能有正确的部分，因而否定一切。只有对犯错误的同志的正面和反面、功绩和错误作全面的观察，才能作出正确的估计。例如我们党在批判各次“左”倾路线的错误时，并没有说他们一切都错了，仍然指出他们在反帝反封建、土地革命、反蒋战争等问题上的若干观点，同主张正确路线的同志们还是一致的。再例如对于斯大林的错误的分析和功过的估计，在“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”和“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”两篇文章中就说得十分明白和正确，又为我们树立了一个具体分析的榜样。
    再其次，处理党内的错误要根据不同的情况采取分别对待的方针和不同的处理方法。“对于那种有意地破坏党的团结，而与党对抗、坚持不改正错误，甚至在党内进行宗派活动、分裂活动和其他危害活动的分子，党就必须进行无情的斗争，给以严格的制裁，直至在必要时将他们驱逐出党”。（见七届四中全会的决议）大家都知道，在1927年我们党曾进行了反对叛徒陈独秀分子的斗争，并清除了这些分子。在1935年红军长征中，党又粉碎了张国焘分裂党的阴谋，从而胜利地完成了伟大的长征。在不久以前，我们又粉碎了进行广泛阴谋活动、企图夺取党和国家最高权力的高饶反党联盟，大大加强了党的团结和统一，这是对维护革命利益和人民利益有很大意义的。大家也知道，我们党对于那些违法乱纪、贪污腐化、道德败坏的不可救药的分子也没有放松，一经发现，就作严肃的处理，以至把他们清除出党。这类的例子我想是不必多举的，不过在一般的情况下面，我们对待由于认识上的错误而在工作中犯错误的同志是采取“惩前毖后，治病救人”，“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的原则，着重思想教育，而不轻易作纪律处分。根据上面所谈，许多同志在工作中的错误大都是由于认识上的主观主义而发生的，所以纠正的办法主要地是加强思想教育，提高这些同志的觉悟水平，使他们今后不再重犯过去的错误，继续团结他们为党工作；同时这样做的目的，也是为了使其他同志取得教训，引以为戒，做好今后的工作。因此，我们对于犯错误的同志所应当采取的态度和方法，一方面是看，一方面是帮；一方面要保护，一方面又要批评。这就是说，我们要看看他是否承认错误，是否愿意在行动中真正地改正错误；同时又要积极地帮助他，多方面地关怀他，促使他改正错误。我们对犯错误的同志首先要加以保护，不应作过火的斗争和打击，也不应当对他加以轻视和歧视；但同时对他的错误又一定要揭发和批判，说明错误的内容、性质、原因和危害，并指出纠正的办法，这才是具体的帮助。这种批评的方式，尽可能是和风细雨的；这种批评的目的，是为了团结同志和保护同志。当然，对于犯了严重错误的同志，例如违反国家的法律，违反党的决议、违反党的纪律等等，也要给予应有的纪律处分，绝不能采取包庇姑息的态度；但就是给了处分，也仍然要耐心地帮助他们认识和改正错误，使他们继续为党工作。对此，党的七届四中全会的决议中指出：“对于那种具有在性质上比较不重要的缺点或犯有在性质上比较不重要的错误的同志，或者对于那种虽然具有严重或比较严重的缺点、犯有严重或比较严重的错误，但在受到批评教育以后，仍能把党的利益放在个人的利益之上，愿意改正并实行改正的同志，应当采取‘与人为善’‘治病救人’的方针。对于他们的缺点或错误必须按照具体情况进行严肃的批评或必要的斗争；但是这种批评或斗争应当贯彻中央和毛泽东同志的指示：‘从团结出发，经过批评或斗争达到团结的目的’，不应当不给他们改正的机会，更不应当故意将他们的个别的、局部的、暂时的、比较不重要的缺点或错误夸大为系统的、严重的缺点或错误，因为这种态度就不是从团结出发，就不能达到团结的目的，就不利于党。”
              （四）
    我们对待党内错误采取这样的方针和态度是否正确呢？首先，我们这个方针是根据列宁的遗教而制定的。列宁曾说过：“公开承认错误，揭露错误的原因，分析产生错误的环境，仔细讨论改正错误的方法，——这才是郑重的党的标志，这才是党执行自己的义务，这才是教育和训练阶级，以至于群众。”（“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）在我们党的历史上有许多执行这种方针的范例，例如在“关于纠正党内的错误思想”这个文件中，毛泽东同志对当时党内的各种非无产阶级的错误思想表现作了批判，并提出了纠正的方法，解决了党的建设和军队建设中的许多基本问题。这是一个对待党内错误进行具体分析的范例。再例如在“关于若干历史问题的决议”这一个文件中，对于我们党在历史上所发生的几次错误路线，特别是从1931年初到1934年底的三次“左”倾错误路线的分析，它不仅指出了各次错误路线（尤其是第三次“左”倾路线）产生的环境、错误的性质和主要内容，以及产生这些错误的思想根源和社会的历史的根源，并且也指出了克服“左”右倾错误的办法和对待党内错误的态度，真是实事求是，合情合理，既能帮助人们弄清思想，以便从过去所犯的错误中取得教训，又能对犯错误的同志采取慎重态度和宽大的方针，以达到团结同志共同工作的目的。这又是一个对待党内错误进行具体分析的范例。我们对待党内错误所采取的这种方针，更鲜明的表现在历次的整风运动中，特别是1942年的一次伟大的整风运动中。整风运动是我们党所采取的党内斗争的运动形式，即在党的统一领导下，一方面学习马克思列宁主义有关的文献和党的文件，一方面讨论党的历史问题和检查党内的错误，开展批评和自我批评，从而把干部和党员引到思想自觉和政治自觉的道路，以达到“坚持真理，改正错误”的目的。结果，这种整风运动是深刻地改变了我们党的面貌，不仅提高了全党的思想水平，挽救了许多的同志，而且大大地增强了党的团结。我们对于党内错误所采取的这种方针和方法，应当说是对马克思列宁主义在党的建设问题上的一个创造性的发展。
    其次，根据我们党从1935年以来对于犯错误的同志一直采取这种方针和方法的经验看来，实践已经证明它是完全正确的。因为许多犯了错误的同志，在这种方针下面，经过党的耐心地说服教育之后，弄通了思想，改正了错误，为党作了有益的工作，使党更加团结和兴旺起来了。这里我们可以举一个突出的例子。为什么大家都对李立三同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上的发言感到很大的兴趣呢？这是因为他的发言生动地证明了我们党的这个方针的正确性。大家都知道，李立三同志曾经犯过严重的路线的错误，他是第二次“左”倾机会主义路线——李立三路线错误的负责人，并且是第一次“左”倾机会主义路线的积极参加者，可是在党的教育和帮助之下，他检讨了自己所犯的错误，知道了错误的根源是主观主义，继续为党工作，并从自己所犯错误的教训中深深体会到党的这个方针的正确性。在他的发言中说道：当中央发现了他1950年在全国总工会工作中所犯的错误的时候，就作了及时的揭发和尖锐的批评，并提到马克思列宁主义原则上来说明错误的实质，批判错误的危害性，这才帮助他较快地觉悟过来。“在我检查自己错误的过程中及检讨了错误以后，中央和许多负责同志，又像医生护理病人一样地关怀我，并给我以在工作中改正错误的机会。我所接触的许多同志，不但不对我歧视，而且给我以不少的同志的帮助、安慰和鼓励。我是深深感到了这种同志的温暖的。这样的关怀和温暖，正好像病后补药一样，使我能够较快一些恢复健康和工作能力。”这些话确实是令人感动的，深富教育意义的，也是具体地体现了党的这个方针的成功和伟大的。
    现在我们根本的任务是建设社会主义，为了实现这个伟大的任务，加强党的领导是一个决定性的条件。为了对党内的是非问题作正确的处理，我们应当贯彻执行这个正确的方针，使党更加团结和坚强，这是使党能保持正确领导的必要条件之一。
    其实，不仅在共产党内有这种是非关系，就是在民主党派内、国家政权和人民团体内，也有是非问题，也有思想斗争，也要进行批评和自我批评，也有人常常犯错误，为了变一切消极因素为积极因素，为了团结一切可能团结的力量来建设社会主义，也要对是非问题、对犯错误的同志作正确的处理。当然，具体处理的情况是和党内不尽相同的。但是，“人民内部的矛盾可以而且应该从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争获得解决，从而在新的条件下得到新的团结。”（“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”）由此可见，研究是非问题，不仅对于党的建设，而且对于国家的社会主义建设都是具有重大意义的。
