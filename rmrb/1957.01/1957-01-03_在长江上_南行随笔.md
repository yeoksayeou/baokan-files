    On the Yangtze River
    —Southbound Jottings
    Li Gao
    I visited the Ningchang Factory of the jointly owned Yongli Jiuda Chemical Industrial Company. In the early morning, I boarded a boat back to Nanjing. The sun had just risen, shining on the mighty Yangtze River. The river roared, rippling with golden waves. A small tugboat played music, towing two small passenger boats, cutting through the water, heading southwest side by side.
    I stood at the bow, watching the fleets of sailboats crisscrossing each other, all laden with various supplies, rushing to their destinations. A line of Minsheng Company steamers floated downstream, coming towards us, flashing past, and heading east. They seemed to be urged on by the factory whistles along the river, or racing against the speeding trains on land. Those playful ducks floated on the water surface in front of the boat, suddenly flying up, circling the boats, then spreading their wings and flying away, landing on the water and swimming upstream rapidly. The river rushed, the boats rushed, and people's hearts also rushed...
    The river wind was whistling, slightly chilly. I went down to the cabin to find a seat. Most of the people on the boat were workers and farmers from along the river. They all had companions, chatting and laughing, making it very lively. Only I had no travel companions, and even if I wanted to speak, I couldn't get a word in. Therefore, I planned to recall the materials from the visit, preparing to write a report.
      "Hey, I almost forgot." Suddenly, a young woman sitting across from me raised her voice to a man beside her, "The sisters in our factory all asked me about it. They said your factory invented some kind of machine, and you got 40,000 yuan in bonuses just for that. What kind of machine is it? It must be very valuable!"
    This caught my attention. The man smiled and looked at her, saying, "What machine? You wouldn't understand even if I told you. It's something that used to be very expensive to import!"
      "Tell me, what's it like?..."
    The man shrugged dismissively, waving his hand and saying, "It's no use explaining. It's like talking shop, you wouldn't understand!"
    The woman poked him with her finger, glaring at him and saying:
  "Look at how proud you are!"
    The man pursed his lips, squinting and smiling at her. The woman urged him to speak again. Just then, they arrived at a dock, and the whole boat was in motion: people getting on, getting off, looking out the windows, chattering noisily. The two of them also leaned on the window, looking at something, close together. I had seen this man when I was waiting for the boat at the dock. He was about twenty-seven or eight years old, well-proportioned, with a ruddy complexion, and quite handsome. When the boat docked, a woman in the cabin waved to him (as if it had been prearranged), presumably this was her. After I entered the cabin, although I didn't pay much attention, I heard some fragments of their conversation. From those conversations, I knew that the woman was a sewing worker, and she was returning to her hometown for some reason. She was twenty-five or six years old, and it seemed like she had children... Thinking about it now, I'm a little confused, what is the relationship between them? Siblings? Doesn't seem like it. Husband and wife? Doesn't seem like it either. In love? The woman seems to have been married before. Therefore, I assume the woman may be divorced, or her husband may have died. From their conversation, I know they are from the same hometown. ... After the boat started, the two of them started talking again. The man introduced her to high-pressure vessels, etc. "...The government certainly values it!" the man continued, "It's not easy to be the first in China to manufacture it successfully! I heard that some people mentioned it before liberation, but the capitalists were afraid of the expense if it failed. Society is different now. The Party and the administration fully support it. Ever since the factory became a joint public-private enterprise in 1952, we have successfully trial-produced the fluidized bed furnace, and the output has increased a lot! Now our factory's output has increased eight times compared to before liberation!
  (He used his thumb and forefinger to compare). Soon we will also build a phosphate fertilizer plant." He looked as if he had been involved in the trial production of high-pressure vessels himself. The woman thought, nodding as if to herself: "Ah, it costs so much money to buy it from abroad!..."
    The tugboat roared with its engine, constantly pushing forward. Another ship was coming towards us, honking its horn loudly. It's not far from Nanjing.
    My two neighbors were talking about something else. I didn't notice how they started, but I only heard the woman say, "She's probably going to be an old maid. That person has no future anymore."
    "How did that happen?" the man asked in surprise.
      "It's all because she's too ambitious!" the woman said with a contemptuous and pitying tone. "You know, she's very pretty: oval face, fair complexion, with a pair of bright, clear eyes. She has a good figure. She is smart and has good skills. She has fascinated many people! But she looks down on workers, and only wants to find someone with 'knowledge'! She has no education herself, and in her twenties, she quit her job to go to school. After two years, she's staying at home now, not coming out to work, and not farming properly..."
      "Did she find a partner?"
      "Where would she find one!" the woman smiled and said, "She says she'll never get married. She's in her early thirties, too good for the ordinary, not good enough for the exceptional, she's really going to be an old maid. Alas, what future is there like this? She's disheartened and also pitiful..."
    The woman sighed. The man frowned slightly, thinking about something. Finally, he said: "Alas! What a waste of a person!..." He shook his head.
    This is a very interesting story. It aroused my imagination. I imagined this clever and beautiful girl, and gradually, I felt that this was a tragedy. I couldn't help but look at these two workers, who are advancing in happiness. It's just like people often describe, our country is progressing by leaps and bounds, but she is... This also reminds me of many such men and women, who are wasting away, the days and months passing by, and when they reach middle age, they are too good for the ordinary, not good enough for the exceptional, always fantasizing about a pleasant person falling from the sky, living alone year after year. I always feel that they are in pain. They are detached from reality.
    What does personal love life count for? That's right. But, it is still somewhat painful, right? However, the problem is not here. Ideals are an inspiring thing, and in our current era, ideals can always be realized. This factory successfully trial-produced high-pressure vessels, and their ideals were realized. These two worker comrades will surely achieve their goals. The problem is that she has gone astray, abandoning something more precious. Unintentionally, I also thought of our work, our writers. They used to write sensational works, making extremely beneficial contributions to the people, but gradually, they also went down the wrong path. They are attached to those comfortable lives: high-quality food, neatly dressed, soft beds, leisurely chats, idle strolls... isolating themselves from the people, from the struggle, and using all sorts of excuses. They recite Chairman Mao's instructions in their mouths, but their asses are always sitting on the sofa! Besides being able to recite, isn't this just like this old maid? She had good skills and was born beautiful, and had once attracted the love of many people, and could be considered a sensation for a while, right? But if this continues, people will no longer pay attention to her—when her beauty fades!
    I also deeply regret this girl. But it's not too late now, as long as you get up from the sofa; why must you be an old maid?…
    The tugboat sounded its whistle. Ah, the bustling city of Nanjing appeared before my eyes. I got off the boat, turned around and looked at the river. Rows of boats were still flying back and forth like shuttles, each moving towards its own goal. …

    在长江上
    ——南行随笔
    立高
    我参观访问了公私合营永利久大化学工业公司宁厂，清晨，搭船回南京市去。太阳刚刚出来，照耀着这浩浩荡荡的江水。江水奔腾着，泛起一片金黄的波纹。小拖轮奏着音乐，挽着两艘小乘船，划开江水，齐头向西南开进。
    我站在船头上，望着那成群结队交插而过的帆船，它们都满载着各种物资，在急匆匆地赶路。上游漂下一排民生公司的火轮，顺水迎面而来，一闪，又向东远去了。它们好像被沿江工厂的汽笛所催促，又好像在和陆上飞奔的火车赛跑。那些顽皮的水鸭，浮在船头的水面上，突然又飞起来，围绕着船只翱翔，接着又展翅远飞，落在水上逆水急游。江水飞奔着，船只飞奔着，人们的心也在飞奔……
    江风飕飕，微微有些凉。我下到舱里，寻一个位置坐下来。船上坐的，大都是沿江的工人和农民，他们都有同伴，说说笑笑的，好不热闹。唯有我没有同路人，纵想说话，也插不进嘴去。因此，我打算回忆一下访问的材料，准备写一篇报道。
      “嘿，我还忘记了。”突然，我对面坐着的一个青年妇女，提高了声音向他身边的一个男的道：“我们厂的姊妹们都问我，说你们厂发明了一种什么机器，光奖金就得了四万元，那是什么机器？这样值钱呀！”
    这吸引了我。只见那男的微笑着望着她道：“什么机器？说来你们哪里知道。是一种靠外国进口的价钱很高的东西呀！”
      “说说看，是怎样的？……”
    男的带着轻藐的神气撇着嘴，摇着手道：“说也白说，隔行如隔山，你们怎么懂得哟！”
    女的用手戳他一下，棱起眼道：
  “瞧你那神气劲儿！”
    男的抿着嘴，瞟着她眯眯地笑。女的又催他说，正好到了一个码头，全船都动荡起来：上的，下的，把着窗口向外了望的，七嘴八舌一阵嘈乱。他们俩也爬在窗口上望着什么，紧紧地靠在一起。这男的，我在码头上等船的时候就见到的。他大约二十七八年纪，匀称个儿，红黑脸膛，长得满俊气。船靠岸的时候，舱里有一个女子向他招手（好像是预先约好的），想必就是这位了。我进舱以后，虽然没有留意，但他们那谈话，我也零零碎碎听到一些。从那些谈话中，我知道女的是一个缝纫工人，不知为什么事，回乡下家里去来。她有二十五六，好像说起有孩子的……。现在想来，我有些不明白，他们俩究竟是什么关系呢？兄妹？不像。夫妻？也不像。在恋爱？那女的好像结过婚。因此，我假定女的可能是离了婚，或者是死了丈夫。从他们谈话中，知道他们是同乡。……船开动以后，他们俩又谈了起来。男的向她介绍着高压容器等等。“……政府当然重视呀！”男的接着说，“中国第一个制造成功，可不是容易的！听说解放以前，也有人提起过，可那会儿资本家怕不成功费钱。现在的社会不同从前了，党和行政上全力支持；自打1952年这个厂公私合营以后，我们就试制成了沸腾炉，产量提高了好多哟！现在我们厂比解放前产量提高了八倍！
  （他用拇指和食指比着）不久我们还要修建一个磷肥厂呢。”他那神气，好像试制高压容器也有他在内似的。女的思索着，点着头像自语道：“呵，要花那样多的钱到外国买呀！……”
    拖轮响着??的马达声，不停地向前推进着。迎面又有轮船开来，哇哇地鸣着汽笛。离南京不远了。
    我这一对邻客又在谈着另一件事情了。他们怎样开的头，我没有注意，只听那女的说：“她恐怕要做老姑娘了，这个人呀，前途也没有了。”
    “那是怎么搞的？”男的诧异地问。
      “都是因为心太高了！”女的带着卑视而又惋惜的口气说。“你知道，那人长得是满漂亮：瓜子脸，有红似白的，生一双凌透透的大眼睛。身段也长得好。人满聪明，手艺也不错。她迷了多少人哟！可是她对工人瞧不上眼儿，一心想找个有‘学问’的！自己没有文化，二十几了，工也不做又去上学。上了两年，现在在家里呆起来，不出来工作，田也不好生做……”
      “找到对象了吗？”
      “上哪里找噢！”女的笑一笑又说：“她说一辈子不结婚了。三十出头了，高不成低不就，真要做老姑娘了。唉，这样下去还有什么前途？心灰意懒了，也怪可怜的……”
    女的叹着气。男的微微蹙起眉头，在思索什么。最后他说：“唉！把个人可惜了！……”摇摇头。
    这是一个很有趣的故事。它引起了我的想像。我想像着这位聪明而标致的姑娘，渐渐地，我觉得这是一个悲剧。我不由地望望这两位工人，他们在幸福中前进。这真像人们所时常描写的，我们的国家在一日千里，而她却……这又使我想起不少这样的男人和女人，他们蹉跎着，日月一天天过去，到了中年，高不成低不就，总幻想从天上掉下一个惬意的人儿，如此一年老似一年孤独地生活着。我总觉得他们是痛苦的。他们脱离了现实。
    个人的爱情生活又算得什么呢？这是不错。可是，它毕竟有些痛苦吧？然而，问题还不在这里。理想是一种鼓舞人的东西，在我们现在的时代，理想总是能够实现的。这个厂试制成功了高压容器，他们的理想实现了。这两位工人同志一定会达到他们的目的。问题在于她走上了歧路，抛弃了那更为宝贵的东西。不期然地，我又想到了我们的工作，我们的作家们。他们过去曾写过轰动一时的作品，对人民做过极有益的贡献，可是渐渐地，他们也钻到歧路上去了。他们依恋着那些舒适的生活：上等的伙食，笔挺的装着，柔软的睡铺，闲逸的清谈，无所事事的游逛……把自己和人民、和斗争隔绝起来，而且用了各种各样的借口。他们嘴里背诵着毛主席的指示，屁股却总坐在沙发上！除了会背诵以外，这不正像这位老姑娘一样么？她手艺不错，生得也漂亮，曾经引动过许多人的爱恋，也算得轰动一时吧？可是这样下去，人们将不会再睬一睬她的——当她的红颜枯萎了的时候！
    我也深深为这位姑娘惋惜。但是现在还不算晚，只要从沙发上起来；何必一定要做老姑娘呢？……
    拖轮拉起了笛声，啊，沸腾着的南京城出现在眼前了。我下了船，转身向江里望去，一排排的船只仍穿梭似地交插飞奔，它们各向自己的目标不停地前进着。……
