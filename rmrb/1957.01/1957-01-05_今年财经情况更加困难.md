Taiwan Situation

    Taiwan newspapers published a statement by a high-ranking Kuomintang official, predicting that Taiwan's financial economy in 1957 would be more difficult than in 1956.

    This unnamed high-ranking Kuomintang official told Taiwan newspaper reporters: Taiwan authorities' financial burden in 1957 will be "further increased" compared to 1956, "mainly due to the continuous expansion of military expenditures, and other expenditures also tend to increase, so it is still difficult to achieve a balanced budget."

    Taiwan newspapers say that in the first three quarters of 1956, the taxes levied by the Taiwan authorities on the Taiwanese people had already increased by more than 800 million Taiwan dollars compared to the same period in 1955. This amount is equivalent to about one-seventh of the Taiwan authorities' total budget in 1956. Before New Year's Day, Taiwan tax officials were pressing the Taiwanese people to pay taxes with extreme urgency. On the 20th of last month, a Taipei newspaper published six announcements from the "Taipei City Tax Collection Office" urging the payment of various taxes. The tax burden will be increased again in the new year, which will make the Taiwanese people even more miserable.

    今年财经情况更加困难
    台湾报纸发表国民党某高级官员的谈话，预测1957年台湾的财政经济将比1956年更加困难。
    这个不愿透露姓名的国民党高级官员对台湾报纸记者说：台湾当局1957年的财政负担将比1956年“更为加重，主要仍为军费支出的不断膨大，其他各项支出亦有增加的趋势，故预算仍难达到平衡”。
    台湾报纸说，在1956年头三季度，台湾当局向台湾人民征收的捐税，已经比1955年同期增加了八亿多元台币。这数目约相当于1956年台湾当局总预算七分之一。元旦以前，台湾税务人员向台湾人民催征捐税急如星火。在上月20日这一天台北市一家报纸上所登载的“台北市税捐稽征处”催征各种各样税捐的公告就有六个。新的一年税额又要加重，将使台湾人民更加困苦。
