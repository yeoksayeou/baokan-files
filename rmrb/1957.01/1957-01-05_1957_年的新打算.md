    New Plans for 1957
    Written Collectively by XINHUA News Agency Shanghai Reporters
    On January 2nd, the first working day of 1957, we visited various aspects of Shanghai's industry to see what new plans people have for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan?
    New Plans of a High-Speed Cutting Expert
    The reporter found Sheng Li, a high-speed cutting expert, at a group meeting of the preparatory meeting for the First Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. He happened to be speaking.
    He said that this year, in carrying out the advanced producer movement and the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy, we must pay attention to comprehensiveness. Last year, when engaging in high-speed cutting, the loss of valuable cemented carbide tools was too great. Also, the cutting allowance of raw materials sent from the heat processing and cutting workshops was too large. For a valuable alloy steel shaft weighing one hundred catties, I had to cut off thirty catties. In this way, although the cutting efficiency was improved, it caused waste.
    After his speech, the reporter quietly asked him: How many meters of new cutting records are you going to create this year? He said that the most important thing this year is how to teach young workers to use cemented carbide tools reasonably in high-speed cutting and prolong tool life. Recently, Sheng Li and several other advanced producers have already performed several times in the workshop, and the trade union also wants him to hold technical lectures on high-speed cutting for young workers. He continued, as for himself, he plans to complete one and a half months' work quota every month this year while compressing the quota on schedule.
     A Novice in Front of the Steelmaking Furnace
    The newly built converter of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant is blazing with flames. Another furnace of steel has been refined. The steelmaking novice—Ni Xiaoyue, a twenty-year-old Grade 3 worker—skillfully used a long-handled small iron ladle to scoop a ladle of molten steel from the furnace.
    The young man enthusiastically talked to the reporter about his new plans for this year. This year, he will strive to reach the level of a second steelmaking assistant (Grade 4-5 worker). He only started learning steelmaking last year and was originally a middle school dropout. Among the four hundred or so steelmaking workers in the entire workshop, the vast majority are novices like Ni Xiaoyue.
    Jiang Zhaochen, the director of the workshop who had also never engaged in converter steelmaking before, told the reporter with confidence: Although everyone is a novice and there are difficulties with raw materials, we will still strive to overfulfill the national plan for this year and strive to achieve the design capacity of 100,000 tons of steel per year in the first year after the new furnace is established.
    A 10,000-Ton Giant Ship in the Pool
    In an indoor pool that is seventy meters long, an electric ocean liner model started up. The pointed bow cut through the green pool water, and the automatic recording instrument on the ship drew winding red lines. Next to the pool, the characters of the electric computer jumped rapidly, and the resistance experienced by the ocean liner model at several different speeds was calculated.
    This is the model test pool of the Ship Science Research Institute. The machine can make waves in the pool. Various ship models are parked beside the pool, some so large that a child can sit on them. The person in charge of the research institute, who guided the reporter on the tour, said that three 10,000-ton ocean freighter models have recently been tested. The designers of the first 10,000-ton giant ship in New China will get reports from here on which hull type is the steadiest, fastest, and most fuel-efficient.
    In 1957, it will cooperate with the needs of China's shipbuilding industry to study about ninety topics in terms of hull type, structure, materials, and power. The 10,000-ton ocean freighter (displacement of about 18,000 tons), a major new product that may be included in the Second Five-Year Plan, is the focus of this year's research work.
    She Wove More Than One Million Meters of Cloth
    Zhang Caifeng, a weaving worker at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory, who is affectionately called "Aunt Haha" by the female workers, is forty-eight years old this year. She said: "Comrade reporter, look, the older I get, the younger I feel. I am in good health, and I don't even need to wear glasses yet. I received a production bonus in the third quarter of last year, and this year I want to strive to be an advanced producer."
    Zhang Caifeng is also a famous folk song singer in the factory. The workers love to listen to her singing of "Meng Jiangnu Seeking Her Husband."
    She started working as a weaver at the age of fourteen. Apart from farming in her hometown for eight years during the Anti-Japanese War, she has worked for a total of twenty-eight years, weaving 1.29 million meters of cloth. Among them, the cloth woven in the seven and a half years after liberation is more than she wove in the previous twenty years.
    Morning in the Laboratory
    Xu Kaikun, an engineer from Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory who has contributed to the technology of domestically produced Remifon, accompanied the reporter to visit the factory's chemical laboratory on the morning of the 2nd. Here, five newly established new product trial production teams are starting the first batch of experiments. Huo Zhenzhen, a young assistant technician, installed a long double-layer glass tube on the test rack. A gas will be cooled and condensed into liquid in this tube to produce a new medicine for the treatment of rheumatic arthritis. Elsewhere, a burst of sour gas attracted the reporter's attention. Xu Kaikun explained that this is the evaporation of an intermediate of a medicine for the treatment of high blood pressure.
    Leaving the laboratory, the engineer, who leads the trial production of new medicines, said: This year, they will trial produce six important new medicines. At the same time, they will extract several chemical raw materials that cannot be produced domestically from the by-products of heavy industrial factories. They will hold their first technical discussion meeting on the 3rd.
    Writing a Letter to the Teacher Far Away
    In the reporter's office, the phone rang, and the voice of the chairman of the trade union of the Huafeng Enamel Factory came from the microphone. He said that on the 2nd, the Huafeng Factory sent a New Year's greeting letter to Qin Tangsheng, an old worker far away in Changsha who taught them kiln building experience.
    The reporter had contacted Qin Tangsheng many times, but the factory always replied that he was not in Shanghai, but in Beijing, Wuhan, or Xi'an, in Changchun. This Qin Tangsheng, who has more than twenty years of kiln building experience, has been helping brother factories build kilns in other places for most of the time since he created a new kiln building method the year before last. He has traveled to most of the sixteen cities in the country with kiln building factories. Someone once calculated that the promotion of this new kiln building method nationwide can save 36,000 tons of lump coal every year.
    In the letter that the Huafeng Factory sent to Qin Tangsheng, they wished him good health in the New Year and better impart his technology to enamel kiln workers in various places.
    Good News of Democratic Management
    When the reporter arrived at the jointly owned public-private enterprise Zhonghua Pharmaceutical Factory, which manufactures "Longhu Rendan," Shen Xinmin, the chairman of the trade union, was in a meeting. The reporter heard them saying that the factory will soon establish an enterprise democratic management committee elected entirely by employees.
    Shen Xinmin said to the reporter with a smile: Recently, the factory held several meetings of all employees to listen to the factory director's report on the work of the whole year. Everyone put forward opinions and suggestions for improvement. The enthusiasm of the employees and the breadth of the speeches were unprecedented. From this, we can see the seedlings of implementing democratic management of enterprises.
    When the reporter bid farewell to the trade union chairman, who was originally an employee of the factory, Shen Xinmin said enthusiastically: "Be sure to invite you to participate when the democratic management committee is established."
    Scientific Experiments by Amateur Researchers
    At the home of amateur science researcher Cheng Weimin, he and his wife and assistant Wan Benyi demonstrated to the reporter an experiment on the mass production of glass fiber.
    Cheng Weimin used a gas flame to melt a glass rod onto a rapidly rotating centrifuge disc. Strands of glittering glass filaments immediately flew in all directions due to centrifugal force and landed on people's bodies. The reporter found that the centrifuge disc was driven by a small motor used by a dentist, and the disc was a piece of rounded iron sheet.
    Cheng Weimin said, do not underestimate this small centrifuge disc. Using this principle for production, the daily output of glass fiber can be much greater than the semi-manual method he successfully researched ten years ago and is currently used in various places, and broken glass can be used as raw material, reducing costs by half. He plans to complete this research work this year.
    With the support of Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Company, Cheng Weimin also plans to study the technology of combining and weaving high-grade glass fiber this year.
    At Father Ji's House
    Ji Rencai, an old cleaner at Shanghai Guomian No. 7 Factory, led the reporter to visit his large family of nineteen people. Except for the old grandmother and the youngest grandson, all of them are textile workers. The old grandmother sat on the edge of the bed, and several young grandchildren played outside the door. The sun shone on the children's faces, making them red.
    Ji Rencai's third son, Ji Hongjin, calculated an account. Last year, Ji Rencai's three sons and daughters-in-law and daughter all received production excellence bonuses, totaling more than 210 yuan; after the wage adjustment, the whole family increased their income by about 250 yuan, and the eldest brother was also promoted.
    The reporter asked them what their plans were for this year? Father Ji said enthusiastically: "I am sixty-one years old this year, but I don't plan to retire, and I want to work hard for a few more years." The third son said: "My wife and I will strive to join the Party this year and become glorious Communist Party members like the second brother."

    1957年的新打算
    新华社驻上海记者集体采写
    1月2日，1957年的第一个工作日，我们访问了上海工业的各个方面，看一看人们在第一个五年计划最后一年有些什么新打算？
    高速切削能手的新打算
    记者在上海市第二届人民代表大会第一次会议预备会议的小组会上，找到了高速切削能手盛利，正好他在发言。
    他说，今年搞先进生产者运动和增产节约，要讲究全面。去年搞高速切削，贵重的硬质合金刀损失太大；还有，热加工和割料车间送来的原料切削余量留得太多，一根一百斤重的贵重的合金钢轴，要我切削掉三十斤。这样，虽然提高了切削效率，但是造成了浪费。
    记者在他发言以后悄悄地问他：今年准备创造多少公尺的切削新纪录？他说，今年重要的是怎样教会青年工人在高速切削中合理使用硬质合金刀，延长刀具寿命。最近盛利他们几个先进生产者已经在车间里表演了几次，工会还要他为青年工人们举办高速切削的技术讲座。他接着说，至于他个人，今年在按期压缩定额的条件下还打算每月完成一个半月的工作定额。
     炼钢炉前的新手
    上海第三钢厂新建的转炉，熊熊地冒着火焰。又一炉钢炼好了。炼钢新手——二十岁的三级工倪小岳，熟练地用长柄小铁瓢从炉里掏出一瓢钢水。
    小伙子热情地向记者谈了今年的新打算。今年，他要争取达到炼钢第二助手（四级——五级工）的水平。他去年才学炼钢，原来是一个失学的中学生。在全车间四百多个炼钢工人中，绝大部分都是和倪小岳一样的新手。
    过去也从来没有干过转炉炼钢的车间主任姜昭臣，满怀信心地告诉记者：尽管大家都是新手，原料也有困难，但是我们仍然要努力超额完成今年的国家计划，争取在新炉子建立起来以后的第一年，达到年产十万吨钢的设计能力。
    水池里的万吨巨轮
    在一个长达七十公尺的室内水池里，电动的海轮模型开动了。尖尖的船头划开了碧绿的池水，船上的自动纪录仪器划出了曲曲弯弯的红线。在水池旁边，电动计算机的字码急促地跳动着，海轮模型在几种不同航速中受到的阻力被演算出来了。
    这里是船舶科学研究所的模型试验池，机器可以使池里掀起海浪。池旁停放着各种各样的船舶模型，有的大得可以坐一个小孩。引导记者参观的研究所负责人说，最近已经试验过三种万吨远洋货轮的模型，新中国第一艘万吨巨轮的设计师们，将要从这里得到哪一种船型走得最稳、最快并且马力最省的报告。
    在1957年，这里将要配合我国造船工业的需要，在船型、结构、材料、动力等方面研究九十个左右的课题。船舶工业可能列入第二个五年计划的重大新产品——万吨远洋货轮（排水量约一万八千吨），是今年研究工作的重点。
    她织了一百多万公尺布
    被女工们亲切地称呼为“哈哈阿姨”的申新第九棉纺织厂织布女工张彩凤，今年四十八岁了。她说：“记者同志，你看，我越活越年轻，身体满好，眼镜也还不用戴。去年第三季度，我得了生产奖金，今年我要争取做一个先进生产者。”
    张彩凤还是厂里出名的唱山歌能手，她唱的“孟姜女寻夫”，工人们很爱听。
    她十四岁就做织布工，除开抗日战争八年在家乡种地以外，共做了二十八年工，织了一百二十九万公尺布，其中解放以后七年半织的布，比以前二十年织的还要多。
    试验室的早晨
    在我国自制雷米风的技术方面有过贡献的信谊药厂工程师徐开坤，2日清晨陪同记者参观了厂里的化学试验室。这里，五个新成立的新产品的试制小组，正在开始第一批的试验。青年助理技术员霍媜媜把一根长长的双层玻璃管装上了试验架，一种气体将在这个管子里冷却凝结成液体，用来制造治疗风湿性关节炎的新药品。在另一处，一阵阵酸味气体引起了记者的注意，徐开坤解释说，这是在蒸发治疗高血压药品的一种中间体。
    从试验室出来，这位领导新药品试制工作的工程师说：今年他们要试制六种重要的新药品，同时，要从重工业工厂的副产品中，提炼出几种国内还不能生产的化学原料。他们要在3日举行第一次技术讨论会。
    给远方的老师傅写信
    在记者的办公室里，电话滴铃铃地响起，话筒里传出了华丰搪瓷厂工会主席的声音。他说，华丰厂2日向远在长沙传授砌窑经验的老工人秦唐生寄出了一封新年祝贺信。
    记者曾经多次找过秦唐生，厂里总是回答说：他不在上海，他在北京，在武汉，或者在西安，在长春。这位具有二十多年砌窑经验的秦唐生，自从前年创造一种新的砌窑法以后，几乎大部分时间都在外地帮助兄弟厂砌窑。全国十六个有砌窑厂的城市，他大多跑过了。有人曾经算过一笔账，这种新的砌窑法在全国推广，每年可以节约三万六千吨块煤。
    在华丰厂寄给秦唐生的信中，祝贺他新年健康，更好地把自己的技术传授给各地搪瓷业砌窑工人。
    民主管理的喜讯
    记者到达制造“龙虎人丹”的公私合营中华制药厂的时候，工会主席沈新民正在开会。记者听到他们在讲：厂里不久要成立完全由职工选举的企业民主管理委员会。
    沈新民笑容满面地对记者说：最近厂里开过几次全体职工会议，听取厂长报告全年工作，大家提意见，提改进办法。职工情绪的热烈，发言的广泛，都是从来没有过的。从这一点，就可以看出实行企业民主管理的苗头了。
  　当记者同这位本厂职工出身的工会主席告别的时候，沈新民热情地说：“成立民主管理委员会的时候一定请你来参加。”
    业余研究者的科学试验
    在业余科学研究者程伟民的家里，他同他的妻子兼助手万本仪，对记者表演了一种大量生产玻璃纤维的实验。
    程伟民用煤气火焰把一根玻璃棒熔化到一只飞快转动着的离心盘上，一缕缕亮晶晶的玻璃丝靠着离心力的作用，立刻飞向四面八方，落在人们的身上。记者发现离心盘是由一只牙科医生用的小马达发动的，盘子是一块敲弯了的圆铁皮。
    程伟民说，不要看轻这只小小的离心盘，用这个原理来进行生产，每天玻璃丝的产量可以比他在十年前研究成功、目前各地采用的半手工操作方法大得多，而且可以用碎玻璃来作原料，降低成本一半。这一研究工作他准备在今年完成。
    在上海市电讯电器公司支持下，程伟民今年还打算研究高级玻璃丝的并线和织布的技术。
    在吉老爹家里
    上海国棉七厂老清洁工吉仁才，领记者到他的十九口人的大家庭作客，这一家除了老奶奶和小孙子，都是纺织工人。老奶奶坐在床边，几个小孙子在门外玩耍，阳光照得孩子们的脸通红。
    吉老爹的第三子吉红金算了一笔账，去年，吉老爹的三对儿子媳妇和女儿全都得到生产优胜奖金，共二百一十多元；工资调整以后全家又增加约二百五十元收入，大哥还升了级。
    记者问他们今年有什么打算？吉老爹兴致勃勃地说：“今年我六十一岁了，但我不打算退休，还要好好干几年。”老三说：“我和我的妻子今年要争取入党，像二哥一样做光荣的共产党员。”
