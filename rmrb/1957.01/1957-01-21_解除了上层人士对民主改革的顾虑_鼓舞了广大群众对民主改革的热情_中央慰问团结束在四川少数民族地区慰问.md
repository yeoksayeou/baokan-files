Xinhua News Agency, January 20th – The Central慰问团, led by团長 Wang Weizhou and副团長 Wang Yifu, returned to Beijing this afternoon.

Those who welcomed them at the station today included Li Weihan,部長 of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and副委員長 of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council; as well as Yu Xinqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Mei Gongbin, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Xie Fumin, Deputy主任委員 of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee; and Wang Feng, Sa Kongliao, and Yang Jingren, Deputy主任 of the Ethnic Affairs Commission.

The Central慰问团 left Beijing last October. Personnel from the main团 and its first, second, third, and fourth sub-团s traveled to Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Xichang Special District in Sichuan, for more than two months of慰问 work. They returned to Beijing by train from Chengdu, Sichuan, on the 18th. The personnel from the fifth sub-团, which went from Kunming to Lijiang Special District in Yunnan last year for慰问, will also return to Kunming soon.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 18th – The Central慰问团 has concluded its慰问 work in the minority areas of Sichuan Province.

In the past two months, the four sub-团s of the慰问团 braved the wind and snow of severe winter, crossed the famous Erlang Mountain, and followed the footsteps of the Long March of the Red Army, reaching more than fifty counties in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Xichang Special District, and the southwestern corner of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province, conducting慰问 activities at more than one hundred and sixty慰问 points. At two hundred and six慰问 rallies and more than two hundred and ninety various座谈会s, the慰问团 personnel directly met with more than 690,000 people of various ethnic groups such as Tibetan, Yi, Qiang, Hui, Miao, Lisu, and Mongolian.

The慰问团 also visited agricultural cooperatives and families of Tibetan, Yi, and Qiang farmers in many remote mountains, and delved into the mountain villages of Liangshan and the pastures in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. The famous Changqingkeer Lamasery in the Tibetan area, Ganzi Dajin Temple, and many other lamaseries and mosques were also visited by慰问团 personnel, and布施 or 帖 were distributed.

Through these activities, the慰问团 conveyed the Central Committee's and Chairman Mao's care for the people of all ethnic groups, and further publicized the principles and policies on adopting peaceful consultation methods for democratic reform in ethnic minority areas, long-term unity and cooperation with upper-level figures, protection of freedom of religious belief, and development of production, based on the development of work in these areas. At the same time, it widely listened to the opinions of people of all ethnic groups and strata on the work of the government, understood their difficulties and demands, suggested that the local government help solve them, and prepared to report to the Central Committee.

The慰问团 presented the people of all ethnic groups and strata, organs, troops, and cadres in these areas with锦旗s inscribed by Chairman Mao, as well as慰问品, more than 50 million catties of relief grain, more than 300,000 sets of winter clothing, and a large number of medicines, medical equipment, and cultural and recreational supplies.

In these more than two months, which were called "forever unforgettable" by the people of all ethnic groups, joyful scenes were presented everywhere the慰问团 went, from the upper reaches of the Yellow River to the banks of the Jinsha River, from the snow-white plateau to the evergreen Anning River Valley. The people of all ethnic groups welcomed the "close relatives sent by Chairman Mao" with the most solemn ethnic etiquette.

The areas are mainly inhabited by Tibetan and Yi people. Since the beginning of last year, Yi areas and Tibetan agricultural areas have successively begun democratic reforms through peaceful consultation. The慰问团's慰问 further encouraged the enthusiasm of the Tibetan, Yi, and other ethnic groups to complete the reform and move towards socialism. In the areas where the reform had been completed, the farmers reported to the慰问团 about the tremendous changes in their lives, thanked the Central Committee and Chairman Mao for their correct leadership, and expressed their determination to work harder to carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

The慰问团 conveyed to the ethnic upper-level figures in various places that after they abandoned the exploitation and oppression of the working people, the state would take appropriate measures to ensure that their political treatment and living standards would not be reduced, and the People's Government also persuaded the people to cooperate with them for a long time. Many upper-level figures in Kangding and Zhaojue spoke about the benefits of implementing this policy based on their own personal experiences. Some upper-level figures, feudal lords, or slave owners who had previously been concerned about democratic reform also dispelled their doubts about having no way out. Ali Mo'ani, an Yi upper-level figure in Huidong County, had avoided meeting with the government in the past because he was concerned about the reform. After listening to the policy explanation of the慰问团 this time, he not only actively expressed his support for the reform, but also mobilized the last five upper-level figures in the county who were more concerned about the reform to go to the city for a meeting, so that they could understand the Communist Party's ethnic policy. In the pastoral areas of Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and other places, the慰问团 widely publicized the policy of "no struggle, no division, both牧工 and 牧主 benefit."

Thousands of letters of thanks and guarantees from ethnic cadres, workers, and soldiers were handed over to the慰问团. These letters described their new understanding and experience of the work and policies after listening to the慰问 report. Cadres in various places proposed to use the actions of doing a good job to respond to the care of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

The Beijing opera, Sichuan opera, song and dance, acrobatics, and film teams that accompanied the团 traveled through mountains and rivers, regardless of the severe cold and fatigue, to perform for the people of all ethnic groups; the medical team treated tens of thousands of people.

The fifth sub-团 of the Central慰问团 will also conclude its慰问 to Lijiang Special District in Yunnan and return to Kunming soon.

    解除了上层人士对民主改革的顾虑　鼓舞了广大群众对民主改革的热情
    中央慰问团结束在四川少数民族地区慰问
    新华社20日讯　中央慰问团在团长王维舟和副团长王一夫等人率领下今天下午返抵北京。
    今天到车站欢迎的有中共中央统一战线工作部部长、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李维汉，国务院秘书长习仲勋，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长余心清，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副秘书长梅龚彬，全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员谢扶民和民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、萨空了、杨静仁等。
    中央慰问团去年10月离开北京。总团和所属的第一、二、三、四分团人员，分赴四川甘孜藏族自治州、凉山彝族自治州、阿坝藏族自治州和西昌专区等地，进行了两个多月的慰问工作。18日从四川成都乘车返京。去年从昆明到云南丽江专区慰问的第五分团人员，最近也将返回昆明。
    新华社成都18日电　中央慰问团已经结束了在四川省少数民族地区的慰问工作。
    在过去两个多月中，慰问团的四个分团，冒着严冬的风雪，翻过著名的二郎山和沿着红军长征的足迹到达了甘孜藏族自治州、凉山彝族自治州，阿坝藏族自治州、西昌专区、甘肃省甘南藏族自治州西南角共五十多个县，在一百六十多个慰问点进行了慰问活动。在二百零六次的慰问大会和二百九十多次各种座谈会上，慰问团人员和六十九万多藏、彝、羌、回、苗、傈僳、蒙古等各族人民直接见了面。
    慰问团还访问了许多深山里的藏、彝、羌等族农民的农业社和家庭，深入到凉山的山村和黄河上游的牧场。著名的藏族地区的长青春科尔喇嘛寺、甘孜大金寺和其他许多喇嘛寺和清真寺，也都有慰问团人员进行慰问，并且发放了布施或?帖。
    通过这些活动，慰问团向各族人民传达了中央和毛主席对他们的关怀，并根据这些地区工作发展情况进一步宣传了关于民族地区采取和平协商方式进行民主改革、对上层人士的长期团结合作、保护宗教信仰自由、发展生产等方面的方针政策，同时广泛听取了各族各阶层人民对政府工作的意见，了解他们的困难和要求，建议当地政府帮助解决，并且准备向中央汇报。
    慰问团向这些地区的各族各阶层人民和机关、部队、干部，赠送了毛主席题字的锦旗以及慰问品，五千多万斤救济粮和三十多万套寒衣，大批的药品、医疗器械和文娱用品。
    在这被各族人民称做永远难忘的两个多月中，从黄河上游到金沙江岸，从白雪如银的高原到四季常青的安宁河谷，慰问团所到之处呈现了欢乐景象。各族人民都用最隆重的民族礼节来欢迎“毛主席派来的亲人”。
    这些地区居住的主要是藏族和彝族人民。从去年年初，彝族地区和藏族农业区都先后开始用和平协商方式进行民主改革。慰问团的慰问更加鼓舞了藏族、彝族等民族人民完成改革走向社会主义的热情。在完成改革的地区，农民纷纷向慰问团报告他们生活中的巨大变化，感谢中央和毛主席的正确领导，表示要更加努力开展互助合作运动。
    慰问团向各地民族上层人士传达：在他们放弃对于劳动人民的剥削压迫以后，国家要采取适当办法使他们政治待遇和生活水平不致降低，人民政府并说服人民群众同他们长期合作。康定、昭觉许多上层人士都用自己切身体会谈到执行这一政策对他们的好处。某些过去对民主改革有顾虑的上层人士、封建主或奴隶主，也消除了怕没有出路等疑虑。会理县的彝族上层人士阿里莫阿尼，过去因为对改革有顾虑，和政府避不见面。这次他听了慰问团的政策解释后，不但自己积极表示赞助改革，还把这个县最后的五个对改革顾虑较大的上层人士动员进城开会，使他们了解共产党的民族政策。在阿坝藏族自治州、甘孜藏族自治州等地的牧区，慰问团广泛地宣传了“不斗不分，牧工、牧主两利”的政策。
    几千封各族干部、工人、战士的感谢信、保证书，纷纷交给了慰问团。这些信中叙述他们在听了慰问报告以后对工作、对政策的新的认识和体会。各地干部提出用做好工作的行动来回答中央和毛主席的关怀。
    随团的京剧、川剧、歌舞、杂技和电影等队，跋山涉水，不顾严寒和疲劳，为各族人民演出；医疗队给数万人看了病。
    中央慰问团第五分团最近也将结束对云南丽江专区的慰问返回昆明。
