Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: "Red Flag" newspaper recently reported that the friendship and exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese people greatly increased in 1956. According to the materials of the Japan-China Friendship Association, last year, a total of about sixty Japanese groups and one thousand two hundred and forty-three people visited China; seven Chinese groups with one hundred and forty-two people visited Japan. Since March of last year, dozens of Japanese guests have visited China every month. Among them were people from various fields such as culture, science, trade, and fisheries, as well as youth, women, and trade union members. Unlike previous years, last year many representatives and technical researchers from counties who usually do not come forward also visited China. The Japanese guests visited China or held meetings with relevant parties. Many groups signed agreements with the Chinese side to promote friendly relations between the two peoples. The Chinese delegations that visited Japan included the table tennis delegation, the Peking Opera delegation, the delegation to the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the delegation to the Asian Industrial Medicine Conference, the trade union delegation, and the fisheries delegation. "Red Flag" newspaper said that the visits of these Chinese delegations enhanced the atmosphere of good neighborliness and friendship among the Japanese people.

　　"Red Flag" newspaper pointed out that, however, the number of Chinese people visiting Japan is still very small. The Japan-China Friendship Association said that the Japanese government, under the pretext that China and Japan have not yet restored diplomatic relations, has restricted the free exchanges between the people of China and Japan.

    新华社10日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”在最近报道说，日中两国人民的友谊和往来在1956年有了很大的增进。据日中友好协会的材料，在去年，日本共有约六十个团体和一千二百四十三人访问了中国；中国有七个团体的一百四十二人访问了日本。到中国访问的日本客人从去年3月以来，每月都有数十人。他们中间有文化、科学、贸易、渔业等各界人士，有青年、妇女和工会会员。和往年不同，去年到中国访问的还有很多在平时不大出头露面的县的代表和技术研究员。日本客人们在中国进行了参观或者同有关方面举行会议。很多团体和中国方面签订了增进两国人民友好关系的协议。中国方面到日本访问的有乒乓球代表团、京剧代表团、出席禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的代表团、出席亚洲产业医学会议的代表团、工会代表团和渔业代表团等。“赤旗报”说，中国的这些代表团的访问在日本人民中间增强了善邻和友好的气氛。
    “赤旗报”指出，但是，中国方面访问日本的人数还是很少的。日中友好协会说，日本政府以中日两国没有恢复邦交为借口，限制了日中两国人民的自由往来。
