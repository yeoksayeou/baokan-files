    A Casual Discussion of Folk New Year Pictures
    Wang Shucun
    In years past, as the twelfth lunar month approached, one would always hear the cry of "Pictures for sale! Buy pictures!" in the alleys. Then people would say: It's almost the New Year again!
    At that time, the picture sellers would carry a large indigo-printed cloth bundle on their backs, inside which were various New Year pictures rolled up in reed mats. If someone wanted to buy, they would open the bundle and flip through the pictures one by one, saying: "Hey! This one is 'Yue Fei Fights Jin Wuzhu,' this one is 'Family Joyfully Celebrates the New Year'; take a look at this big, chubby baby, buy it and you'll have a chubby son..." As the people looking at the pictures listened to his delightful stories and auspicious words full of rhymes, everyone would pick out a few they liked and buy them to paste in their homes, to enjoy for at least a year.
    In the past, folk New Year pictures were printed using woodblocks (sometimes with color washes added by hand), and were a distinctive type of national art in our country. Production areas were widely distributed in the north and south provinces; Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian, Suzhou in Jiangsu, Chunan Tan in Hunan, Yangliuqing in Tianjin, Wuqiang in Hebei, and Weixian in Shandong were all famous New Year picture production areas, among which the Suzhou's Fengqiao and Shantang areas and Tianjin's Yangliuqing were the best in terms of history and quality. Suzhou's early New Year picture woodblocks were destroyed by Qing troops in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom War, and can no longer be seen! Now, only Yangliuqing still has a large number of Qing Dynasty engraved blocks (about two thousand kinds of designs). This part of the preserved blocks possesses all kinds of themes in folk New Year pictures, and can be considered a relatively complete and valuable legacy in our country's traditional folk art.
    From the existing materials, the reason why woodblock New Year pictures from various places are loved is not only because the figures on the screen are lively, compact, and brightly colored, and the titles are auspicious, but more importantly, the themes are moving and in line with the people's wishes. For example, New Year pictures with historical stories as their themes, such as "Jing Ke Presents a Map and Makes Trouble in the Qin Court" and "Liang Hongyu Beats the Drums to Fight Jinshan", were very popular because they expressed the people's respect for patriotic heroes. At the same time, the poor rural people in the past relied on this to obtain a little historical knowledge. Others, such as "Good Harvest, Many Auspicious Celebrations" and "Wealth and Abundance," either through homophones or using symbolic metaphors, reflected people's pursuit of a prosperous and good life. Still others, such as "Strong Crops," "Celebrating the New Year," and "Wenchang Temple Fair," depicted the joy of people's hard work and life. Such themes accounted for a very important proportion of the content of New Year pictures. In addition, "God of Wealth Brings Treasures" and door gods and stove horses were only a small part.
    New Year pictures are a visual art that goes deep into the people, and it has a broad educational role that cannot be ignored, especially as it can arouse the interest of children. After listening to the adults' explanations, they can sometimes remember them for many years (the author himself has this personal experience). After the Xinhai Revolution (1913), the Zhili Education Department used this form to print some so-called "improved New Year pictures" to eliminate superstition, promote cutting queues, and oppose foot binding. Although they stopped printing the following year, they still played a certain role at the time.
    Some authors of new New Year pictures are able to study and absorb the advantages of folk New Year pictures, which is very good. I hope that in addition to organizing authors to depict socialist construction and the beautiful lives of the people, New Year picture publishing units can also depict more revolutionary historical stories, such as the heroic deeds of anti-Japanese heroes Yang Jingyu, General Zuo Quan, and martyrs Zhao Yiman, Liu Hulan, and Dong Cunrui, as well as other heroic figures, which can all be put into paintings. However, there are still not many such New Year pictures in the current New Year pictures. If they are printed, I think they will definitely be welcomed by the people and will have great significance for the patriotic education of children. Is it possible to try? Please consider this, New Year picture authors and publishing units.

    漫谈民间年画
    王树村
    往年，每到腊月近年的时候，胡同里总会听到一种“画来，买画咧！”的叫卖声。于是人们便会说：又是过年了！
    那时卖画的人儿，都是背着一个蓝印花大包裹，里面是用苇帘卷着各种各样的年画。如若有人想买，他就将包裹打开来，一张一张地掀动着，嘴里还讲着：“嘿！这张是‘岳爷大战金兀术’，这张是‘合家欢乐过新年’；再看看这个大胖娃娃，买去生个胖小儿……。”看画的人们，听了他那动听的故事和满口上韵的
  “吉祥”话，大家都要挑上几张自己喜爱的，买回去贴在家里，起码欣赏一年。
    过去的民间年画，都是木版印刷（间有彩笔晕染的），是我国民族艺术中颇有特色的一种。产地广布于南北各省；福建的漳州、泉州，江苏的苏州，湖南的楚南滩，天津的杨柳青，河北的武强，山东的潍县等地，都是有名的年画产地，其中历史较久、质量较优的，则以苏州的冯桥、山塘一带和天津的杨柳青两地为首屈一指。苏州早期的年画，版片在太平天国战争中被清兵焚毁，今已不可复睹！现在，只有杨柳青民间尚存有一大部分清代的刻版（约两千种版样），这部分保存下来的版片，具备了民间年画中所有的各种题材，可算是我国传统的民间艺术中比较完整的一大宗宝贵遗产。
    从现有的材料来看，各地木版年画之所以惹人喜爱，不仅在于画面上人物热闹紧凑、色彩鲜艳夺目，以及吉利的标题等等，而更重要的还是在于动人的和符合群众意愿的题材内容。例如“献地图荆轲闹秦庭”、“梁红玉击鼓战金山”等这类以历史故事为题材的年画，由于表达了人民对爱国英雄人物的崇敬，就很受欢迎。同时，过去穷乡僻壤的农村百姓，也赖此获得些微的历史知识。又如“丰年多吉庆”、“富贵有余”等，或借谐音，或用象征比拟手法，反映了人们对物阜年丰的美好生活的追求。再如“庄稼壮”、
  “大过新年”、“文昌庙会”等等，更是描绘了人民勤苦劳动和生活的乐趣。诸如以上各种题材，在年画内容的比重上，占着很重要的地位。此外的“财神进宝”以及门神、灶马之类，不过是其次的一小部分罢了。
    年画是一种深入民间的造型艺术，它有着不可漠视的广泛的教育作用，尤其最能引起儿童们的兴趣，他们听了大人的讲解，有时竟会长年牢记不忘（笔者自己就有这样的切身体会）。辛亥革命后（1913年），直隶教育厅曾利用这一形式印了些破除迷信、提倡剪辫、反对缠足等等的所谓“改良年画”，虽然第二年就停印了，可是在当时还是起了一定的作用的。
    现在的新年画，有些作者能研究和吸收民间年画的优点，这是很好的。我希望年画出版单位除了组织作者描绘社会主义建设和美好的人民生活以外，也能多多描绘革命历史故事，如抗日英雄杨靖宇、左权将军和赵一曼、刘胡兰、董存瑞诸烈士以及其他英雄人物的英雄事迹，都是可以入画的。但是这样的年画在目前的新年画中却还不多，如果印出来，我想一定会受到人民群众的欢迎，对于儿童们也有爱国主义教育的重大意义。是否可以尝试？请年画作者和出版单位考虑。
