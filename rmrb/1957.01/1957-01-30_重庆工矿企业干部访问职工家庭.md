Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 29th: Before the Spring Festival, many cadres from industrial and mining enterprises and basic construction units in Chongqing went to visit workers' homes to understand their lives. Since the 27th, the Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions and several municipal industrial trade unions have organized visiting teams of over 200 people to visit workers. Many cadres from the Party, trade union, and administrative departments of factories and mines also went to workers' families with difficulties to express their sympathy.

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Chongqing 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory, and more than 20 other units, based on investigations, allocated funds to appropriately subsidize workers with difficulties in celebrating the Spring Festival. At Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, one thousand workers with family financial difficulties received subsidies. Temporary construction workers scattered in the streets also received more than 10,000 yuan from the Municipal Construction Trade Union to help the most needy four hundred households celebrate the Spring Festival.

The weather in Chongqing is cold around the Spring Festival. The trade union organizations of many units also rushed to make a batch of cotton clothes and quilts to send to workers who had difficulty keeping warm in winter. The Municipal Construction Trade Union alone allocated more than 30,000 yuan to various grassroots trade unions to provide difficult workers with winter clothing.

    重庆工矿企业干部访问职工家庭
    据新华社重庆29日电　重庆市不少厂矿企业和基本建设单位的干部在春节前深入访问职工生活。27日以来，重庆市工会联合会和几个市级产业工会组织，组织了两百多人的访问队，分别访问职工。不少厂矿的党、工会和行政方面的干部也深入到有困难的职工家庭慰问。
    重庆钢铁公司、重庆六一零纺织染厂等二十多个单位，根据调查，分别拨出一批款适当补助过春节有困难的职工。重庆钢铁公司有一千名家庭生活困难的职工领到了补贴。散居在街道上的临时建筑工人，也由市建筑工会拨出一万多元帮助最困难的四百多户人家过春节。
    春节前后重庆气候冷。许多单位的工会组织还赶制一批棉衣、棉被送给过冬有困难的工人。单是市建筑工会就拨了三万多元给各基层工会，为困难的职工添制御寒衣物。
