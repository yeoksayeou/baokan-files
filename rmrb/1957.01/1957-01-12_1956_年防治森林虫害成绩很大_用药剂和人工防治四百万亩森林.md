Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: In 1956, the work of forest pest control was further developed throughout the country.

The total forest area treated with chemical agents and manual labor was approximately four million mu. In some areas of Shandong Province where insect pests were severe, after control measures, many counties, townships, and cooperatives free from insect pests have emerged. In Hunan Province, pest surveys and the training of pest control personnel were conducted before the control measures, which enabled the control work to be carried out in depth and improved the control effect.

Fujian, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces have also established specialized control agencies to strengthen leadership in forest pest control in border areas. Guangxi, Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian and other provinces have formulated plans for the prevention and control of forest diseases and insect pests while formulating afforestation plans, which has greatly promoted the development of prevention and control work.

However, in some areas, the insect pests are still serious due to the lack of appropriate arrangements for this work. The unreasonable assessment of work points for pest control by some agricultural producers' cooperatives is also an important reason affecting the enthusiasm of cooperative members in forest pest control.

    1956年防治森林虫害成绩很大
    用药剂和人工防治四百万亩森林
    新华社10日讯　1956年全国各地防治森林虫害工作有了进一步的开展。
    全国经过药剂和人工防治的森林面积约四百万亩。山东省某些虫害严重的林区，经防治后，已出现了不少无虫害的县、乡和社。湖南省在防治前还进行了虫情调查和训练防治骨干等工作，使防治工作得到深入开展并提高了防治效果。
    福建、湖北、江西等省为了对交界地方的森林虫害防治工作加强领导，还成立了专门的防治机构。广西、安徽、广东、福建等省在制定绿化规划的同时，也制定了防治森林病虫害规划，这对开展防治工作起了很大的推动作用。
    但是，有些地区由于没有适当安排这项工作，以致虫害仍然严重，部分农业生产合作社对治虫的工分评定得不合理，也是影响社员防治森林虫害工作积极性的一个重要原因。
