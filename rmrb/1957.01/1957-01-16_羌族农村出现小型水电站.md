Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 14th. A small hydropower station was recently completed by the Qiangfeng Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative in Cutou Village, Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, where the Qiang people live in concentrated communities. All ninety-plus Qiang families in the village, who previously used pine torches and oil bamboo for lighting, now have electric lights in their homes.

When this hydropower station began construction in December of last year, it coincided with the Qiangfeng Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative transitioning to a higher-level cooperative. The members enthusiastically participated in the labor. During the construction of the hydropower station, the state allocated power generation equipment and flour milling machines for processing wheat and corn.

This hydropower station will be managed by the Qiang people themselves. Qiang technicians Wang Qicai and Wang Guoxun, who were trained during the station's construction, have basically mastered technologies such as wiring, installing lights, and operating motors.

    羌族农村出现小型水电站
    新华社成都14日电　羌族聚居的四川汶川县簇头村羌锋农林生产合作社，前几天修成了一座小型水电站。全村九十多户以前用松明和油竹照明的羌族农民，家家都有了电灯。
    这座水电站在去年12月兴建时，正逢羌锋农林生产合作社转高级社，社员们都欢欣鼓舞地参加劳动。水电站修建中，国家调来了发电设备和加工小麦、玉米的磨面机。
    这个水电站将由羌族人民自己管理，在建站时培养起来的羌族技术员王启才和王国勋，已经基本上掌握了架线、装灯和操作电机等技术。
