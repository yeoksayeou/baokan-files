The Party and the government have recently advocated for planting as much rice as possible in all provinces, cities, and districts of northern China. Because rice is a high-yielding crop and a desirable food, its successful large-scale planting will have significant implications for rapidly increasing China's grain production and improving the lives of the people in the northern provinces, cities, and districts.

Since summarizing and publishing the experience of high rice yields in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, the thirteen northern provinces, cities, and districts, under the leadership of the Party and the government, have organized visiting groups to learn from this advanced experience in Yanbian. The results of the visits have proven that "rice can not only be widely planted in the north, but also increase the yield per unit area" (People's Daily, September 11, 1956, page 3).

If we examine it from a historical perspective, for a long time, the vast working people of our country, advanced agronomists, scientists, and enlightened officials have made many efforts to plant rice in the north and have created valuable experiences. Their successes can serve as a reference for us, and their failures (including the difficulties encountered) can serve as a warning.

The northern provinces of our country were originally the place of birth and development of the Han nationality. In ancient times, for a long period, many places used to grow rice. After the second century AD, the situation changed. The oppression and exploitation of peasants by the feudal ruling class caused repeated large-scale famines in northern China. This was followed by large-scale invasions by foreign ethnic groups, the water conservancy and irrigation system was gradually destroyed, and residents gradually migrated south. After the Song Dynasty unified China in the tenth century, the north almost completely lost the traditional experience of planting rice. During the same period, due to the suitable climate and superior water conservancy conditions, rice planting gradually became a specialty of the south. Especially in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, during the period when the Southern Song Dynasty clung to a part of the country, the southeastern region became the rice-producing area of the country.

After the fourteenth century, the capital was moved to Beijing. Officials in the capital and the garrison troops guarding the northern borders needed a large amount of rice for food. At that time, the foolish rulers only knew how to follow the policies of the Sui and Tang dynasties, enslaving hundreds of thousands or millions of hard-working people, and transporting rice extracted from the southeast to the north through the Grand Canal. However, far-sighted scientists and water conservancy experts strongly advocated planting rice in the north. Among those who persisted most strongly and achieved effective trial planting between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries were Guo Shoujing, Yu Ji, Xu Zhenming, Wang Yingjiao, Dong Yingju, Xu Guangqi, and Chen Yi.

Xu Zhenming's "Lushui Ketan" and Xu Guangqi's "Tuntian Shugao" ("Tuntian Shugao" is included in the "Nongzheng Quanshu" Volume 12 and "Augmented and Revised Collection of Xu Wending Gong" Volume 2; the "Wenji" also contains an article "Caohe Yi" that can be consulted), both believed that the reason why rice was not planted in the north was related to water conservancy issues. They believed that "water is the means by which grain is produced," but at that time, the mountains and springs north of the Huai River were diverted into the Grand Canal to transport grain, thus making it even more impossible for the vast areas of the north to produce grain; if this water were used for planting, "then the water in the northwest would also be grain." Therefore, they said pointedly: "The southeast produces it, the northwest transports it, wasting twice the water to get one grain" (Xu Guangqi's words). But if "the northwest has one stone of intake, then the southeast saves several stones of transportation" (Xu Zhenming's words).

Yu Ji, Xu Zhenming, Xu Guangqi, Chen Yi, and others who cooperated with them believed that planting rice in the north would benefit the country and the people. They devoted all their efforts to fighting against the reactionary and conservative ideas of the time. However, it was not easy to reverse the situation that had been created over a thousand years. Therefore, they all advocated starting from the vicinity of Beijing first (i.e., the so-called "Jingdong"), and after achieving success, promoting it outwards, gradually expanding to the entire northwest. They conducted multiple experimental plantings successively at different times in roughly the same areas, creating many good experiences.

The first trial planting can be traced back to the end of the tenth century. Around 988-1021 AD, northern China was still severely oppressed by the Khitans. He Chengju and Huang Mao initiated the pioneering work of cultivating fields and planting rice in the garrison troops they led. According to the "History of the Song Dynasty" (Song Shi Volume 176 Shihuozhi Shang 4, Volume 273 He Chengju Biography), He Chengju was stationed with troops in Xiong, Mo, Ba, Pingrong, and Shunan, which are the places surrounding the southeast and west sides of Baiyangdian today. These places have been relatively low-lying since ancient times, so they were called "Tangluo" at that time. He Chengju installed sluice gates on the south bank of Tangluo for six hundred miles, using Tangluo water to irrigate the fields and plant rice. However, in the first year, "the rice planting encountered frost" and failed. This new pioneering undertaking was originally opposed by some people, and the first failure gave the opponents more reason to speak. He Chengju and Huang Mao did not lose confidence. They studied the reasons for the failure and came up with ways to overcome them. They believed that "late rice ripens in September, but the frost in Hebei is early and the ground is cold," so it failed. However, "early rice in Jiangdong ripens in July," which is compatible with the climate in the north. Therefore, in the second year, they planted early rice, and it ripened in August before the frost. They loaded several carts of rice ears and sent them to the capital, and the opponents had nothing to say. From then on, the cultivated fields gradually expanded, reaching more than 4,200 hectares by 1021, with an annual harvest of more than 29,400 stones of rice. Even now, some places around Baiyangdian continue to plant rice.

Xu Zhenming was the one who advocated building water conservancy in the northwest and vigorously trial-planting rice in Jingdong after He Chengju. He almost sacrificed his life to start this undertaking. Based on Yu Ji's theory and methods, absorbed He Chengju's experience, and added his own on-the-spot investigations, he repeatedly submitted memorials detailing the benefits of planting rice in the north between 1575 and 1585 AD, but no one believed him. Unfortunately, at this time, he was demoted and had to leave the capital and go to the Lu River (now Tongzhou), where he wrote a scientific monograph on the reasons and plans for developing this undertaking, which is "Lushui Ketan."

After Xu Zhenming left the capital, some local officials planted rice according to his plan, which was very effective, so the emperor summoned him back and made him the墾田使 (Commissioner of Land Reclamation). Within six months, he cultivated more than 39,000 mu of paddy fields, and rice was planted in all suitable places. This undertaking was about to develop, but the powerful eunuchs and imperial relatives often seized idle land near Beijing for their own business; although reclaiming paddy fields was beneficial to the country and the people, it conflicted with their interests in seizing land, so they spread rumors that reclaiming fields and planting rice was not beneficial. The emperor, representing the interests of landlords and nobles, issued an order to stop Xu Zhenming's work.

Although Xu Zhenming failed, it prompted the continuous efforts of Wang Yingjiao, Zuo Guangdou, Dong Yingju, Xu Guangqi, and others, and achieved a major success in the early eighteenth century.

In 1725, there was a major flood in Hebei. Due to the proper measures taken by the government, the movement to revive rice planting was also restored during the process of flood control. Chen Yi, a water conservancy expert, participated in the overall planning and leadership of this work. He completely inherited and developed the theories and experiences since Yu Ji and Xu Zhenming, and gave the people certain guidance and assistance, so the people spontaneously reclaimed paddy fields and planted rice.

In 1726, the government established four special bureaus - Jingdong, Jingxi, Jingnan, and Tianjin - to lead the water conservancy work of thirty-seven prefectures and counties. Based on the documents of the four bureaus and his own investigations, Chen Yi made a detailed statistics of the number of mu of paddy fields reclaimed and their locations within nine years, and wrote "Shuili Yingtian" Volume, which was included in the "Jifu Tongzhi". In 1824, Wu Bangqing supplemented the map and engraved it into a separate edition, entitled "Shuili Yingtian Tushuo".

From the "Tushuo," the following three issues can be seen:

First, since the government sent people to manage the fields and plant rice in Jingdong in 1726, each mu yielded three or four stones, which aroused the enthusiasm of the people to reclaim fields and plant rice spontaneously. Therefore, the area planted with rice in the second year increased more than twenty times compared to the first year, and in the second and third years, the area operated by farmers themselves exceeded the area operated by the government. This shows that as long as the farmers are given examples and the reasons are explained clearly, they will reclaim paddy fields and plant rice.

Second, no new paddy fields were reclaimed in 1730, and in 1731, more than 532 hectares of paddy fields were changed to dry land. I think this measure should be paid special attention to. According to my estimation, the two years of 1730 and 1731 were probably for inspection and adjustment, changing the fields with insufficient water sources to dry land and planting other grains or vegetables. Therefore, in the three years after 1731, the new area for planting rice continued to rise, and in 1734, another 1,695 hectares of paddy fields were reclaimed.

Third, the "Tushuo" contains several larger numbers: Cizhou reclaimed 1,010 hectares of paddy fields in one year in 1727, Xin'an reclaimed 3,894 hectares in three years from 1727 to 1729, and Wen'an reclaimed 3,459 hectares in two years from 1733 to 1734, totaling 2,363 hectares, accounting for more than one-third of the 5,795 hectares reclaimed in nine years. This is worth noting. I believe that the outstanding achievements in these three places were not only due to the better water conservancy conditions, but also due to the historical experience of planting rice (Cizhou was left by Guo Shoujing, and Xin'an and Wen'an were left by He Chengju).

Although planting rice in the north is a cause that benefits the people, it cannot be valued by the ruling class under the feudal system. At the same time, the insufficient development of science and technology at that time was also a reason why this cause could not be developed. Today, our government is the people's government, and its main task is to seek benefits for the people of the whole country. Our Party has also summarized the experience of high rice yields in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, believing that: in our country, if appropriate measures are taken, rice can also be grown in the north. Therefore, once the reclamation of paddy fields and planting of rice in the north are launched this time, it will surely become a permanent cause for the people.

    我国北方播种水稻的历史
    王重民
    党和政府最近提倡在我国北方的各个省市区尽可能地大量地播种水稻。由于水稻是高产作物，是一种优美的食粮，大量播种成功以后，对于迅速增加我国粮食产量，改善北方各个省、市、区的人民生活，具有非常重大的意义。
    自从总结和发表了延边朝鲜族自治州的水稻丰产经验以后，北方十三个省、市、区，在党和政府的领导之下，又组织了参观团到延边去学习这一先进经验。参观的结果证明，“在北方不但可以普遍种植水稻，而且也能够提高水稻单位面积的产量”（1956年9月11日人民日报三版）。
    若是更从历史上考察一下，在很长的时间内，我国广大的劳动人民，先进的农学家、科学家，以及开明的官吏们，对于在北方播种水稻，已经做过不少次的努力，也创造过一些宝贵经验。他们成功的地方可以供我们参考，他们失败的地方（包括所遭到的困难）可作我们鉴诫。
    我国北方各省本来是汉民族生育和发展的地方，在古代很长的时期以内，不少地方曾经种植着水稻。公元第二世纪以后情况起了变化。封建统治阶级对于农民的压迫和剥削，使中国北方屡次造成大灾荒；接着又来了外族的大侵扰，水利灌溉制度逐渐破坏，居民逐渐向南方迁徙。到第十世纪宋代统一中国之后，北方几乎完全丧失了种植水稻的传统经验。在同一时期内，南方由于气候的适宜，水利条件的优越，播种水稻逐渐成了南方的专业。尤其在第十二、三世纪南宋偏安的时代，东南地区成了全国的稻乡。
    第十四世纪以后，国都迁到北京。京城里面的官吏和把守在北方边境上的驻防军，都需要大量的稻米作食粮。当时愚蠢的统治者只知道追随着隋唐以来的政策，奴役着几十万几百万的劳苦人民，把从东南榨取来的稻米，由运河运到北方。可是有远见的科学家和水利学家们，则极力提倡在北方播种水稻。其中持之最力，并且试种有成效者，在十四到十八世纪中间，有郭守敬、虞集、徐贞明、汪应蛟、董应举、徐光启、陈仪等。
    徐贞明著“潞水客谈”、徐光启著“屯田疏稿”（屯田疏稿载农政全书卷十二及增订徐文定公集卷二、文集内还有漕河议一篇可以参看），都认为北方不种水稻，与水利问题有关系。他们以为“水者生谷之借也”，可是，当时却把淮河以北的山水泉水都导入运河去运粮，因而使得北方的广大地区越不能生谷；如果利用这些水去播种，“则西北之水亦谷也”。所以他们痛切地说：“东南生之，西北漕之，费水二而得谷一也”（徐光启语）。但若“西北有一石之入，则东南省数石之输”（徐贞明语）。
    虞集、徐贞明、徐光启、陈仪和他们一同合作的一些人，认为在北方播种了水稻，就能够为国家为人民造福利。他们付出一切力量，同当时的反动的保守的思想作斗争。但是，要把历史上一千多年来所已经造成的局势扭转过来，并不是容易的。因此，他们都主张先从北京附近（即所谓“京东”）做起，有了成效，再向四外推行，逐渐扩展到全西北。他们曾经在不同的时间，在大致相同的地区，相继作了多次试验性的播种，创造了许多良好的经验。
    第一次试种，可以追溯到第十世纪的末年。大约在公元988—1021年间，中国的北方还是严重地被契丹压迫着，何承矩、黄懋在他们所领导的驻防军里，兴办了屯田种稻的创举。据宋史记载（宋史卷176食货志上四、卷273何承矩传），何承矩驻军在雄、莫、霸州、平戎、顺安等军地方，就是今天围绕着白洋淀东南西三面的地方，这些地方从古就比较洼下，所以当时叫作“塘泺”。何承矩在塘泺南岸六百里长的地方，安置斗门，用塘泺的水灌田种稻。可是，第一年“种稻值霜”，失败了。这种新的开创事业，本来就有人不赞成，第一次的失败更给了反对者以口实。何承矩、黄懋并没有丧失自信，他们研究了失败的原因，还想出克服的方法。他们认为“晚稻九月熟，河北霜早而地气迟”，所以失败。但是“江东早稻，七月即熟”，是和北方的气候相适应的。于是，在第二年播种了早稻，果然在霜降以前八月就熟了。他们载了几车稻穗送到京城里去，反对者都没有话说了。从此，屯田逐渐扩大，到1021年，所开辟的稻田达到了四千二百多顷，每年收米两万九千四百余石。直到现在，白洋淀边有一些地方还在继续播种水稻。
    徐贞明是在何承矩以后，提倡兴修西北水利，首先在京东试种水稻最力的一个人。为了开创这一事业，他几乎付出了他的生命。他根据虞集的理论和方法，吸取了何承矩的经验，更加上自己所做的实地调查，在公元1575—1585年间，屡次上疏详言在北方播种水稻的利益，但是没有人听信他。不幸的是正在这个时候，他又遭了贬谪，只好离京，走到了潞河（即今通州），才把他对于发展这一事业的理由和计划，写成了一部科学专著，这就是“潞水客谈”。
    徐贞明出京以后，有的地方官按照他的计划播种了水稻，很有成效，所以皇帝又把他召回来，叫他做了垦田使。他在六个月时间内，就开辟了三万九千多亩水田，宜于水稻的地方都种上了水稻。这一事业眼看就要发展起来，可是专权的宦官和皇亲国舅们，时常侵占北京附近的闲田为业；虽说开辟水田是于国家人民有利，但和他们侵占土地的利益相冲突，于是他们就造谣说开田种稻并没有益处。代表地主和贵族利益的皇帝，就下诏把徐贞明的工作停止了。
    徐贞明虽然失败了，但引起了汪应蛟、左光斗、董应举、徐光启等人的不断努力，并且在十八世纪初年，得到了一次较大的成功。
    1725年河北大水。由于政府的措施得当，在治水的过程中，同时兴复了播种水稻的运动。当时参加全面规划和领导这一工作的是水利学家陈仪。他完全继承和发挥了虞集、徐贞明以来的学说和经验，给予人民一定的指导和帮助，因而人民自动地开辟水田，播种水稻。
    1726年，政府设立了四个专局——京东、京西、京南和天津四局，领导三十七个州县的水利工作。陈仪曾根据四局的文献和自己的调查，把九年内所开辟的稻田亩数和位置，做了详细的统计，写成“水利营田”一卷，载入“畿辅通志”内。1824年吴邦庆补绘地图，刻成单行本，题为“水利营田图说”。
    从“图说”中可以看出下列三个问题：
    一、自从1726年政府在京东派人营田，播种水稻，每亩收三、四石不等，因而鼓起了人民自动开田种稻的热情。所以第二年播种水稻的面积就比第一年增加了二十多倍，而第二年和第三年内，农民自营的面积又都超过了官营面积。这说明了只要给农民做出榜样，说清道理，他们就会开辟水田，播种水稻。
    二、1730年没有开辟新稻田，1731年反而把五百三十二顷多稻田改为旱田，这一措施我认为是应该特别注意的。据我估计，大概1730和1731两年，是做了检查和调整工作，把水源不充足的田地改为旱田，另播种其他谷物或蔬菜，所以从1731年以后的三年中间，播种水稻的新面积一直往上升，到1734年又继续开辟了水田一千六百九十五顷。
    三、在“图说”内包含着几个较大的数目字，就是：磁州在1727一年内开辟了稻田一千零十顷，新安在1727—1729三年内开辟三千八百九十四顷，文安在1733—1734两年内开辟三千四百五十九顷，共二千三百六十三顷，占了九年内所开辟的五千七百九十五顷的三分之一强，这是值得注意的。我认为这三个地方所以能够有突出的成效，固然是由于水利条件较好，也是由于有播种水稻的历史经验（磁州是郭守敬留下的，新安和文安是何承矩留下的）。
    在北方播种水稻虽然是一件有利于人民的事业，但是在封建制度之下，是得不到统治阶级的重视的。同时，当时科学技术不够发达，也是使这个事业不能得到发展的一个原因。今天，我们的政府是人民的政府，主要任务就是给全国人民谋福利。我们的党又总结了延边朝鲜族自治州的水稻丰产经验，认为：在我国，如果采取了适当的措施，北方也是能种水稻的。因此，这次在北方开辟水田，播种水稻，一经开展之后，一定能够成为人民的永久事业。
