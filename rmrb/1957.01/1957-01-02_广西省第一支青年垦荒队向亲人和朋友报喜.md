Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 30th—At the end of the year, the first youth volunteer reclamation team in Guangxi Province sent representatives of the Zhuang and Han nationalities to Nanning and other places to report good news to their relatives and young friends.

　　Over the past year, the reclamation team members have cultivated more than 1,700 mu of farmland on the barren mountains of Yongning County in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture with their own hands. In the struggle against severe drought and insect pests, they planted 13 kinds of crops such as corn, peanuts, upland rice, and sugarcane. Now, the grain harvest alone is 230,000 catties. They also raised and grazed more than 400 pigs, sheep, and cattle, as well as flocks of chickens, on the evergreen hillsides. The dormitories, which were thatched huts half a year ago, are now brick houses. New warehouses are also being rushed to completion.

　　In the "big family" formed by more than 160 Zhuang and Han youths, both male and female, everyone participated in the amateur cultural and technical school they run themselves. The Cantonese opera group, Cai Diao group, dance, and singing groups of the reclamation team have attracted many members to participate, and the club is full of gongs and drums every weekend night. The team members who love sports also built a sports field for regular exercise. The reclamation team members unanimously stated that they want to take root in the virgin land that has been reclaimed.

    广西省第一支青年垦荒队向亲人和朋友报喜
    新华社南宁30日电　在岁末年终的时候，广西省第一支青年志愿垦荒队，派出了僮、汉族代表到南宁等地，向亲人和青年朋友们报告喜讯。
    一年来，垦荒队员在桂西僮族自治州邕宁县的荒山上，用自己的双手开垦了一千七百多亩田地。在和严重旱灾和虫灾的斗争中，种上了玉米、花生、旱稻、甘蔗等十三种作物。现在，仅粮食就收获了二十三万斤。他们还在四季青翠的山坡上，饲养和放牧了四百多只猪、羊、牛和成群的鸡。半年前还是茅草屋的宿舍，现在已经是砖房。新的仓库也正在赶工。
    在一百六十多个僮、汉族男女青年结成的“大家庭”里，大家都参加了自己办的业余文化技术学校学习。垦荒队的粤剧组、彩调组、舞蹈和歌咏组开展的文娱活动，吸引了很多队员参加，每逢周末夜晚，俱乐部里锣鼓喧天。爱好体育活动的队员们，还修建了体育场经常锻炼身体。垦荒队员们一致表示，他们要在被开垦的处女地上生根。
