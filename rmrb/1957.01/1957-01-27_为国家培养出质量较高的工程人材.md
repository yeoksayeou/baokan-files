    Cultivating High-Quality Engineering Talents for the Nation
    Wu Darong, Vice President of Nanjing Institute of Technology

    What kind of talents should higher institutes of technology cultivate? Undoubtedly, they should cultivate talents that meet the needs of national construction. In the process of national industrial construction, there is a need for a wide variety of talents, and these talents can also be cultivated in different places and in different ways. For example, some talents can be cultivated in higher institutes of technology, some in secondary vocational schools, some in training classes, and some on-site. Therefore, in deciding what tasks the higher institutes of technology should undertake in cultivating cadres, it is necessary to make specific considerations based on the country's overall plan and the actual situation of current industrial and mining enterprises. Which talents must be cultivated in higher institutes of technology? Which talents can be cultivated in other ways? How should various aspects cooperate in the specific work of cultivating talents to be most beneficial to current industrial construction? These issues must be considered first in order to correctly handle the contradiction between quantity and quality, to determine the scope of professional breadth, and to clearly define the training objectives of higher institutes of technology.

    If it is said that higher industrial education in our country has had the shortcomings of emphasizing quantity and neglecting quality in the past few years, and that attention should be paid to cultivating higher-quality engineering technicians in the future, then we must first clearly recognize what constitutes higher quality. Under the current specific conditions, what level can graduates of higher institutes of technology possibly reach? We believe that graduates of higher institutes of technology should have a broad and solid theoretical foundation, strict engineering training, and a certain amount of practical production knowledge. Of course, school education has certain limitations. We cannot teach students all the knowledge they will use in their future work, nor can we expect students to become skilled engineers as soon as they leave school. However, we must teach students to expand their knowledge from existing knowledge, that is, we must cultivate students' ability to work independently. Knowledge is infinite, and what we can teach students can only be a very small part, and because of the continuous development of science and technology, even if we can teach students the advanced technology of 1957, it will still be backward by 1962. Therefore, the problem does not lie in how much knowledge students have learned, but rather in whether students can use knowledge and whether they have mastered the methods of dealing with problems. At the same time, because we are training engineering technicians, graduates must have the thinking methods of engineers, such as comprehensively considering problems, accurate engineering viewpoints and economic viewpoints, and considering practical applications when solving problems.

    The object of education is people, and people are different from machines. We say "manufacture" machines, but we say "cultivate" talents. The meaning of "cultivate" includes the development and growth of the training object itself. In the past, although we often talked about the "specifications" of graduates, strictly speaking, the word "specifications" is not very appropriate, and it is better to use the word "level." The specifications of a machine will not change once they are set, while the level of a person can be gradually improved. Therefore, the educational policy must pay attention to the characteristics of people so that they have the possibility of full development. The dimensions of a casting will never be larger than the mold, but the achievements of students will often exceed those of teachers, and the development of people is limitless. Therefore, the education process is not only about imparting knowledge, but more importantly, preparing conditions for the future development of students. In order to meet the needs of national industrial construction, the engineering technicians we cultivate must not only be able to use the knowledge they have learned to solve engineering technical problems, but also be able to creatively promote the advancement of science and technology when encountering new problems.

    After the adjustment of departments, higher institutes of technology carried out teaching reforms. In the process of learning from the Soviet Union, we have achieved great success. The path we have taken is correct. In a short period of a few years, we have cultivated many talents, which have played a certain role in the country's industrial construction. We criticized the general education of the old universities and promoted specialized education. Because the combination of theory and practice is better, generally speaking, our graduates can quickly take on specific work in their jobs. However, we also have many shortcomings in our work. The excessive burden on students has not been well resolved in the past few years. Because students are too nervous when studying, the knowledge they learn is difficult to digest and consolidate, which hinders the cultivation of independent working ability. These factors hinder the development of students after graduation, which is detrimental to industrial construction in the long run. Because the foundation is not well laid and the professional scope is too narrow, students have less adaptability to work after graduation, especially when the assigned work and the professional knowledge learned cannot be completely matched, the problem becomes more prominent. Therefore, some issues are worth raising for reconsideration today. Is it necessary for enterprises to require graduates of higher institutes of technology to be able to immediately undertake specific work within a narrow professional scope? Or would we rather lay a better foundation so that graduates can adapt to more aspects of work after a short period of training? Can the caliber be accurate when assigning work?

    Judging from the experience of the past few years, the caliber cannot be accurate when assigning graduates' work. It takes four or five years for higher education institutions to train a student, and it is difficult to foresee the needs four or five years later. Due to the development of work, the country's plans may inevitably change, and people's work will inevitably be adjusted. Moreover, because science and technology are developing extremely fast, even if the caliber is accurate today, there will still be a gap after some time. Taking a step back, even if the caliber is accurate in all aspects, it is not necessarily the best thing from an educational point of view. Because this approach does not take into account the development of people, that is, it limits today's scientific and technological level to tomorrow's scientific and technological level. To put it more clearly, this is overemphasizing current interests and neglecting long-term interests. From the perspective of long-term interests, higher institutes of technology should train engineering technicians with a better foundation and a slightly broader range of specialties.

    The Higher Education Department recently convened a symposium for higher institutes of technology to revise the teaching plan and re-discuss the issue of training objectives. At the meeting, everyone believed that to improve the quality of graduates, it is necessary to strengthen the foundation. Of course, the so-called strengthening of the foundation does not mean simply increasing the content of basic courses, but to make students learn more solid and thorough, including the theoretical basis of basic technical courses and professional courses. Even if less specific professional knowledge is learned, as long as students have the ability to work independently, they can still supplement it in work practice. The engineering technicians we train must be able to flexibly use the knowledge they have learned, be more adaptable to work, and be able to continuously improve with the progress of science and technology.

    It must be pointed out that we have emphasized strengthening the theoretical foundation in revising the teaching plan, which is correct. But I believe that in implementing the teaching plan, we must emphasize combining theory with practice. What we are training today are still specialized talents, engineering technicians who can undertake specific work. Although students have learned a lot of professional knowledge in school in the past few years, they still tend to be divorced from reality. A pile of specific knowledge does not equal linking theory with practice. The real combination of theory and practice is to raise practical production practice to the height of theory and use theory to solve practical problems. Therefore, in implementing the teaching plan, we must focus on teaching links such as experiments, design, and production internships to prevent the tendency to talk about theory divorced from reality.

    In order to improve teaching quality, we have revised the teaching plan. But at the same time, we must note that even if we make the teaching plan very good, we still cannot guarantee the improvement of teaching quality. The teaching plan is to be implemented by people. Ultimately, the future teaching quality will depend on the level of the teaching staff. Because there are more new teachers in higher institutes of technology, how to do a good job in training teachers is the key issue in improving teaching quality in the future.

    为国家培养出质量较高的工程人材
    南京工学院副院长　吴大榕
    高等工业学校应该培养什么样的人材？无疑的，应该培养符合于国家建设需要的人材。在国家工业建设的过程中，需要有多种多样的人材，这些人材也可以在不同的场所用不同的方式来培养。例如，有些人材可以在高等工业学校培养，有些人材可以在中等专业学校培养，有些人材可以在训练班培养，也有些人材可以在现场培养。因此，在决定高等工业学校培养干部的工作中所应当担负的任务时，必须根据国家的总体规划结合当前工矿企业的实际情况作具体的考虑。那些人材必须在高等工业学校中培养？那些人材可以用其它方式培养？在培养人材的具体工作中，各方面应当如何配合，才能对当前的工业建设最为有利？必须先行考虑这些问题，才能正确地处理数量和质量之间的矛盾，才能确定专业宽窄的范围，才能明确规定高等工业学校的培养目标。
    如果说我国高等工业教育在过去几年中有强调数量、忽视质量的缺点，今后应当注意培养出质量较高的工程技术人员，那么我们首先必须明确认识，怎样才算质量较高？在当前的具体条件下，高等工业学校的毕业生可能达到什么样的水平？我们认为，高等工业学校的毕业生应当有广泛而坚强的理论基础，应当有严格的工程训练，而且要有一定的生产实际知识。当然，学校教育是有一定的局限性的，我们不可能教给学生将来在工作中用到的一切知识，我们也不可能希望学生在一出校门以后就能成为熟练的工程师。但是，我们必须教会学生能从已有的知识来扩大自己的知识领域，也就是说，必须培养学生的独立工作能力。知识是无穷的，我们所能教给学生的，无论如何也只能是极小的一部分，而且由于科学技术的不断发展，即使能把1957年的先进技术教给学生，到1962年也仍然会落后。因此问题倒不在于学生所学得的知识的多少，更重要的倒在于学生是否能运用知识，是否已掌握了处理问题的方法。同时因为我们所培养的是工程技术人员，毕业生必须要具有工程师的思想方法，如综合性地考虑问题，工程上的准确观点和经济观点，在解决问题时必须考虑实际应用等等。
    教育的对象是人，人和机器不同。我们说“制造”机器，但是我们却说“培养”人材。“培养”的意义，包含着培养对象本身的发育成长在内。以往我们虽然也常说毕业生的“规格”，严格说来，“规格”二字是不很恰当的，不如用“水平”二字较为好些。机器的规格，一经制定以后，便不会变动，而人的水平，是可以逐步提高的。因此，教育的方针，必须要注意到人的特点，使有充分发展的可能性。铸件的尺寸，决不会大于模子，而学生的成就，却往往会超过老师，人的发展是不可限量的。因此，教育过程不仅仅是传授知识，更重要的是要为学生将来的发展准备条件。为要适应国家工业建设的需要，我们所培养的工程技术人员，不仅要能运用学到的知识来解决工程技术上的问题，而且要在遇到新的问题时，能够创造性地推动科学技术前进。
    在院系调整以后，高等工业学校进行了教学改革，在学习苏联的过程中，我们取得了巨大的成绩。我们所走的道路是正确的，在短短的几年内，我们培养了不少人材，对国家的工业建设起了一定的作用。我们批判了旧大学的通才教育，推行了专业教育，由于理论和实际结合得较好，一般说来，我们的毕业生很快地就能在工作岗位上担当起具体的工作。但是我们在工作中也有不少缺点，学生负担过重在几年来都没有能很好解决。由于学生在学习时过分紧张，学到的知识难以消化巩固，因而也妨碍了独立工作能力的培养。这些因素阻碍了学生在毕业以后的发展，长期说来是对工业建设不利的，由于基础打得不够好，专业范围过窄，学生在毕业以后，对工作的适应性较小，尤其是在所分配的工作和所学得的专业知识不能完全符合的时候，问题更显得突出，为此有些问题，在今天是值得提出来重新讨论的。企业单位是否有必要要求高等工业学校的毕业生立刻就能担当起狭窄专业范围以内的具体工作？或者我们宁愿把基础打得好些，使毕业生在经过短期训炼以后能够适应较多方面的工作？在分配工作的时候口径能否对得很准？
    从以往几年的经验看来，在分配毕业生的工作时，口径是不可能对得很准的。高等学校培养一个学生，要经过四、五年的时间，很难预见到四、五年以后的需要。由于工作的发展，国家的计划有时也难免有些变更，人的工作也必然会有调动。而且由于科学技术发展得极快，即使今天对准了口径，过一些时候仍然会有距离。再退一步说，即使在各方面都把口径对准了，从教育原则上来说，也不一定是最好的事情。因为这样的做法没有考虑到人的发展，也就是说把今天的科学技术水平限住了明天的科学技术水平。说得更明确一些，这就是过分重视了当前的利益而忽视了长远的利益。从长远利益着想，高等工业学校应该培养基础较好而专业略广的工程技术人员。
    高等教育部最近召集了高等工业学校修订教学计划的座谈会，重行讨论了培养目标的问题。在会议上，大家认为要提高毕业生的质量，必须加强基础。当然所谓加强基础并不意味着仅仅增加基础课的内容，而是要使学生学得巩固些、透彻些，也包括基础技术课及专业课的理论基础在内。具体的专业知识、即使学得少些，只要学生具备了独立工作能力，仍然可以在工作实践中补足。我们所培养的工程技术人员，必须能把所学到的知识灵活运用，对工作的适应性较强而且能随着科学技术的进步不断进步。
    必须指出，在修订教学计划时，我们强调了加强理论基础，这是正确的。但我认为，在执行教学计划时，却必须强调结合实际。我们今天培养的仍然是专业人材，是能够担当具体工作的工程技术人员。以往几年学生虽然在学校内学到了不少专业知识，却仍然有脱离实际的倾向。一大堆具体知识的堆砌，并不就等于联系实际。真正的理论联系实际，是要把实际的生产实践提高到理论的高度，运用理论来解决实际问题。因此，在执行教学计划时，必须抓紧实验、设计、生产实习等教学环节，防止脱离实际空谈理论的倾向。
    为要提高教学质量，我们修订了教学计划。但是同时必须注意到，即使我们把教学计划订得很好，仍然不能保证教学质量的提高。教学计划是要由人来执行的，今后的教学质量归根结底将决定于师资的水平。由于在高等工业学校中新的师资较多，因此，如何做好培养师资的工作是今后提高教学质量的关键性问题。
