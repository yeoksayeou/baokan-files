　　They Came From Henan
　　By Our Correspondent Shen Shi

　　I have seen the winter wheat they sowed, tasted the vegetables they grew, and strolled on the dams they built. Over 40,000 young farmers, far from their homes in Henan, have, in just half a year, harvested their first fruits of labor on the fertile lands north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.

　　I have attended their weddings, visited their newly established homes, and talked with them on the newly reclaimed wasteland. These vibrant young people can proudly say that they have taken root in Xinjiang.

　　In the warm and dry month of May, they arrived, travel-worn, at the farms of the Production and Construction Corps. Soldiers and young women lined up to welcome them, guiding them on a thorough tour. The rotated fields, lush orchards, and screen-like windbreaks filled them with admiration. At the welcome meeting, the commander said warmly, "Comrades, you are guests, but also masters now."

　　On the wasteland planned for reclamation, the soldiers built dugouts for them, erected heated brick beds, and brought firewood. They deeply felt that these hardworking soldiers were also hospitable people.

　　At the evening gathering, the captain asked them, "Having come to this wasteland and living in dugouts, what do you feel?"

　　They smiled.

　　The captain encouraged them, "As long as we work hard, before long, the wasteland will become fertile fields, and new houses will replace the dugouts."

　　To take care of the newly arrived young women, the commander arranged for them to learn field management instead of participating in reclamation. They arrived in the company during the busy cotton planting season. Many of the newcomers didn't know how to space seedlings or prune branches; the young women who had come earlier from Hunan and Shandong shared their cotton-growing skills with their new friends.

　　Reclamation began. In the early morning, they shouldered their hoes and headed to the wasteland. In the first few days, they weren't used to using the hoes. The veteran soldiers told them, "We were like that at the beginning too; with time, it becomes easier to use." The young farmers engaged in water conservancy construction didn't know how to dig canals to specifications or install water control gates; the experienced soldiers patiently taught them as well.

　　Those who had grown up in the countryside were not accustomed to the disciplined collective life of the Production and Construction Corps farms. Getting up, eating, and going to the work site at the same time felt awkward to them. Many demobilized soldiers came to Xinjiang with them; whenever they couldn't bear the constraints and complained, these demobilized soldiers would comfort them, saying, "Look at the veteran soldiers on the farm, didn't they come from the countryside? They live happily, can't we do the same?" Some even used their experiences in the army to enlighten them. Half a year later, although some still felt this life was not as free as it was at home, they had become much more accustomed to it than when they first arrived at the farm.

　　When they bid farewell to their hometowns, their parents repeatedly urged them to take care and were reluctant to part. Since arriving in the Tianshan Mountains, they have frequently received letters from their loved ones, as well as photos and sturdily sewn cloth shoes. In the letters, their distant relatives ask about their lives, the climate of Xinjiang, and its customs. How many hearts in 40,000 families are thinking of them! Although they have replied with letters and sent money home, their elderly parents are still worried.

　　Liu Wenjie, short in stature, had served in the People's Liberation Army for eight years, traveling across half of China. He had been to the picturesque Erhai Lake and Cangshan Mountain, and had also crossed snowy mountains, reaching Lhasa in Tibet and Chayu on the border. Once he was demobilized and returned home, he missed his eight years in the military. Not long after being home, the local government called on young people to go to Xinjiang to reclaim wasteland, and he immediately signed up. His mother asked him, "You just came back, and now you're leaving again?" Liu Wenjie, knowing his mother's feelings, comforted her, saying, "Henan and Xinjiang are the same; when I get settled over there, I'll come and get you."

　　Now, at the Anjihai Farm in the Manas River Basin, he is diligently learning to drive a tractor every day. He wants to tell his mother that the farm he is on is the largest cotton-growing farm in China, newly planned. To the east of the farm, a reservoir is under construction. A newly completed canal, thirty-nine kilometers long, brings water from the Tianshan Mountains to irrigate the farm's fields. When his driving skills are proficient, the tractor he drives will race across the vast fields.

　　Wu Zhenxi, with a dark complexion and a strong physique, came from Xicun, Gongxian County, to the Ula Usu Farm in the Manas River Basin. Initially, he and some others who came with him dug canals leading to the wasteland. Wu Zhenxi didn't know how to repair the canals or install water-saving gates. He learned as he worked and quickly became proficient. He also came up with many ways to save manpower and improve efficiency. In the first three months, he was named a production model seven times. Wu Zhenxi recalled when he left his hometown, his second brother took out thirty yuan and said to him, "Zhenxi! Take this with you! If things aren't good over there, keep it for the fare back home." Now, Wu Zhenxi wants to tell his second brother: Your concerns were unnecessary!

　　When Wang Songmei's parents heard that their daughter was going to Xinjiang, they were very unhappy. Being old, they only had this one daughter, how could they let her go so far away? Wang Songmei and Wang Yanzhao from the same village had been together since childhood, and they had a deep love for each other. Wang Yanzhao was the first to sign up for the voluntary reclamation team going to Xinjiang, how could Songmei bear to be separated from him? Despite her parents' affections, how could they stop their children's determination? They arrived at the Ula Usu Farm, the man went to reclaim wasteland, and the woman stayed temporarily at the company's headquarters. Every holiday, either Songmei would go to the reclamation team to see Yanzhao, or Yanzhao would come to the company's headquarters to see Songmei. On National Day, a grand wedding was held in the farm's auditorium. Among the fifty-nine young couples who got married, there were Songmei and Yanzhao. Now, Songmei has also moved to the reclamation team, and they live next door to the captain and instructor!

　　Li Guilan, a girl of only seventeen, knew that five members of her family had signed up for the voluntary reclamation team, and she insisted on going. Her uncle Hongkui advised, "Guilan! You're not old enough, wait a few days!"

　　"Then why did you sign up too?" Guilan retorted.

　　"Although I signed up, I wasn't approved. The township head said, 'You are the deputy director of the agricultural cooperative and can't leave.' If the township head doesn't agree, I have to obey, right?" The uncle explained.

　　"Then why can aunt and great-aunt go?"

　　"Your uncle Hongjun and great-uncle Zhangcheng went, and they shouldn't be separated either!"

　　The uncle's advice did not shake the girl's determination. She refused to eat for three consecutive days, insisting on going. Anxious, Hongkui had no choice but to go to the township government, but the township government also disagreed. He then went to the Xia邑County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the county committee finally approved.

　　Six members of their family went to Xinjiang. Guilan and her brother Guiqing were assigned to the Shihezi Agricultural Experimental Farm; Zhangcheng and his wife Xia Shuyun were in Daquangou, learning to manage the reservoir there; Hongjun and his wife Liu Lanying were on a farm north of the Tianshan Mountains.

　　Among the more than 40,000 voluntary reclamation team members, there are many Hui farmers from counties such as Xiangcheng, Shangqiu, Baofeng, and Xia邑. In order to take care of their customs, the commanders of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps instructed the farms to assign them to the same team. At the Ula Usu Farm, I visited the Hui reclamation team. Deputy Captain Ma Xuekong's hometown is in Shenqiu. He asked me to tell the elders in his hometown: "We have come here and have already built a small reservoir with our own hands. Our customs are respected here, and even the cattle and sheep we eat are slaughtered by the ahong who came with us." I also met Ma Renming and Liu Haowen in this team, who have already married Hui girls since arriving here.

　　In winter, the climate north of the Tianshan Mountains is very cold. The newcomers from Henan have already put on new cotton-padded clothes and leather boots, and covered themselves with new cotton quilts. After reclaiming a large amount of wasteland, they are also stepping up their cultural studies. More than 40,000 parents, brothers, and sisters thousands of miles away, please rest assured! Your loved ones are living well here. The farm commanders are cherishing them and educating them just like you do. You don't need to worry too much!

### 他们从河南来

    他们从河南来
    本报记者　沈石
    我见过他们播的冬麦，尝过他们种的菜蔬，在他们修筑的堤坝上徘徊过。四万余青年农民，远离他们的家乡——河南，仅仅半年，在天山南北的沃土上，初次获得了劳动的果实。
    我参加过他们的婚礼，拜访过他们新成立的家，在新开垦的荒地上和他们谈过话。这些生气勃勃的年轻人，可以骄傲地对人说，他们在新疆已经扎住了根。
    在那和煦的干燥的5月，他们风尘仆仆地到了生产建设部队的农场。战士们，姑娘们，列队相迎，引导他们尽情地参观。那轮作的条田，蓊郁的果园，像屏风般的林带，使他们称羡不置。在欢迎会上，指挥员亲切地说：“同志们，你们是客人，也就是主人了。”
    在计划开垦的荒地上，战士们给他们修盖了地窝子，砌好了睡的火炕，运来了干柴。他们深深地体会到：这些辛劳的战士，也就是殷勤好客的人。
    晚会上，队长问他们：“来到这荒地上，住的是地窝子，有什么感觉呢？”
    他们笑了一笑。
    队长勉励他们说：“只要我们努力，隔不多久，荒地会变成良田，新式的房屋会代替地窝子的。”
    指挥员为了照顾新来的姑娘，让她们学习田间管理，没有参加垦荒。她们初到连队，正是植棉紧张的时候。许多新来的人不会定苗，不会整枝；掌握了植棉技术的早先从湖南、山东来的姑娘们，把自己学得的技术告诉了新来的朋友。
    垦荒开始了。清晨，他们扛着砍土镘前往荒地。最初几天，他们不习惯使用砍土镘。老的战士告诉他们：“我们当初也是这样；日子久了，使用起来，就方便了。”从事水利建设的青年农民，初来的时候，不懂得挖渠要怎样才合乎规格，也不会安装节制水量的闸门；经验丰富的战士同样耐心地教给他们。
    从小在农村长大的人，刚到生产建设部队的农场，很不习惯这种有纪律的集体生活。同时起床，同时吃饭，同时到工地，他们尝试起来，总觉得别别扭扭。同他们一道来新疆的有许多复员军人；每当他们受不了这种约束发发牢骚的时候，这些复员军人劝慰他们说：“看农场里的老战士，他们不是从农村中来的吗？他们愉快地生活着，难道我们就不能吗？”有的还用自己从前在部队里体会到的来启发他们。时隔半年，尽管有的人还觉得这种生活不如在家乡那么自由自在，可是比起他们初到农场的时候已经习惯得多了。
    他们告别家乡的时候，父母亲是怎样的反复叮咛，恋恋不舍。自从来到天山南北，经常接到亲人的来信，也收到他们的照片和缝得挺结实的布鞋。在信里，远方的亲人，问到他们的生活，问到新疆的气候和风俗人情。四万个家庭，有多少颗心惦念他们！尽管他们回了信，寄了钱，可是年老的父母还是放心不下。
    个子矮矮的刘文杰，曾经在人民解放军里八个年头，走遍了半个中国。他到过风景如画的洱海苍山，也翻越过重重雪山，到达西藏的拉萨和国境线上的察隅。他一旦复员回乡，八年的部队生活，使他倍加留恋。在家没有多久，当地政府号召青年前往新疆垦荒，他立刻报名参加了。母亲问他：“你刚刚回来，又要走吗？”刘文杰知道母亲的心情，安慰她说：“河南、新疆，还不是一样；等我在那边安排好了，再来接你。”
    现在，他在玛纳斯河流域的安集海农场，每天紧张地学习着驾驶拖拉机。他要告诉母亲：他所在的农场是新近规划好了的我国面积最大的植棉农场。农场的东边，正在修建一座水库。一条新竣工的长达三十九公里的渠道，引着从天山流下来的水，灌溉农场的田亩。当他驾驶技术熟练之后，他驾驶的拖拉机，就会在广阔的田野上纵横奔驰。
    面孔黝黑、身强力壮的吴振西，从巩县西村到了玛纳斯河流域的乌拉乌苏农场。起初，他和同来的一些人开挖通往荒地的水渠。吴振西不懂得怎样整修水渠和安装节水闸。他边做边学，很快就熟练了。他还想出许多办法，来节省人力和提高工效。在最初三个月里，他七次被评为生产能手。吴振西回想离别家乡的时候，他二哥拿出三十块钱来，对他说：“振西！带上吧！如果那边不好，留作回家的路费。”现在，吴振西要告诉他二哥：你当时的顾虑是多余的！
    王松梅的父母听到女儿要去新疆了，心头很不高兴。年纪老了，只有这一个闺女，怎能让她远走高飞呢？王松梅和同村的王彦召，从小就经常在一起，两人有了深厚的爱情。王彦召首先报名参加了到新疆去的志愿垦荒队，松梅怎舍得和他分离呢？尽管父母情长，又怎能挡得住儿女的决心呢？他们到了乌拉乌苏农场，男的去开荒，女的暂留在连队驻地，每到假日，不是松梅到垦荒队去看望彦召，便是彦召到连队驻地来瞧松梅。国庆节那天，农场的礼堂里，举行了盛大的婚礼，在结婚的五十九对青年男女当中，就有松梅和彦召。现在，松梅也搬到垦荒队去了，他们和队长、指导员毗邻而居哩！
    年仅十七岁的姑娘李桂兰知道全家有五口人报名参加了志愿垦荒队，她争着要去。她叔父鸿魁劝告说：“桂兰！你不够年龄哩，等一些日子吧！”
    “那么你为什么也报了名呢？”桂兰反驳说。
    “我虽然报了名，可是没有被批准，乡长说：‘你是农业社的副主任，不能离开。’乡长不同意，我不是也得服从吗？”叔父解释着。
    “那么婶婶和叔祖母为什么也可以去呢？”
    “你叔叔鸿钧和叔祖父长成去了，他们也不宜分离哩！”
    叔父的劝告，没有动摇姑娘的决心。她连续三天没有吃饭，坚持要去。急得鸿魁没办法，找乡政府，乡政府也不同意她去；又去找中共夏邑县委，县委终于批准了。
    他们一家六口人到了新疆。桂兰和他的哥哥桂卿被分派到石河子的农业试验场；长成和他的妻子夏淑云在大泉沟，学习管理那儿的水库；鸿钧和他的妻子刘兰英在天山以北的一座农场里。
    在四万多个志愿垦荒队员中间，有许多从项城、商丘、宝丰、夏邑等县来的回族农民。新疆军区生产建设兵团的指挥员为了照顾他们的风俗习惯，指示各农场把他们编在一个队里。在乌拉乌苏农场，我访问了回民垦荒队。副队长马学孔，老家在沈丘。他托我转告他家乡的父老说：“我们来到这里，已经用自己的手，修建了一座小型水库。我们在这里，风俗习惯受到尊重，连吃的牛羊也是由同来的阿訇宰杀的。”我还会见了这个队的马仁明和刘好文，他们来到这里，已经同回族姑娘结婚了。
    冬天，天山以北的气候很冷。从河南新来的人，早就穿上了新的棉衣和皮靴，盖上新的棉被。他们开垦了大量荒地之后，又在加紧学习文化了。四万多人在千里以外的父母兄弟姊妹们，尽管放心吧！你们的亲人在这儿生活得很好，农场的指挥员，像你们一样在爱抚着他们，教育着他们，你们不用多惦念吧！
