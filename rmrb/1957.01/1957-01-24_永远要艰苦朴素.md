While visiting Ruijin County, the site of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, I met many former staff members of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government and veteran Red Army cadres and soldiers. When they described their past struggles, they all spoke of how all revolutionary cadres and the people shared weal and woe, and worked hard to smash the reactionary派military encirclement and suppression and economic blockade. Huang Zixun, a former staff member of the Land Department of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government and now secretary of the Xianghu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Ruijin County, told me: At that time, cadres' clothing, food, housing, and transportation were all integrated with the people, without any special privileges. The lives of revolutionary leaders were as simple as those of ordinary people. When the masses had difficulties, the cadres tightened their belts to help them, and the masses did everything they could to support the revolutionary war.

On the morning of January 18, I accompanied the Jiangxi Provincial Ganzhou Revolutionary Old Base Area Inspection Group to Yeping Village, the site of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government. In Yeping, an old man in his sixties led us to pay our respects to the former site of the General Office of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government and Chairman Mao's former residence. The old man's name was Xie Xiucheng, and he used to work in the local Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government. The former site of the General Office is the most common ancestral hall in the southern countryside. The First National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, which shook the whole country in 1931, was held here. After the meeting, it was divided into sixteen rooms with wooden boards and used as the General Office. To the right of the General Office, we paid our respects to Chairman Mao's former residence. The building of the former residence looks the same as all the farmhouses in the village from the outside. Only after entering the door can you see the east and west wing rooms, with stairs leading upstairs. To be precise, it cannot be called a building. The upstairs is very low, a bit like a loft. The house is very small, with a total of eight rooms and two halls. The area of the hall is about twenty square meters, and each room is only eleven or twelve square meters. Xie Xiucheng led us upstairs to a room facing south and told us: This is Chairman Mao's living room and office. There is no furniture in the room now, but it is very clean. On the south-facing window, everyone found a grid made of wood. Xie Xiucheng said: This is where Chairman Mao put his books. He also told us: The room facing north was Premier Zhou's living room and office; the small hall in the middle was where the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held meetings back then. When we went downstairs after visiting this simple small house, Yang Shangkui, the head of the inspection group and First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, said earnestly: "Young cadres should be allowed to see it so that they can know the hardship of the revolution in the past and learn this glorious tradition."

Before this, I also visited the Ruijin Revolutionary Memorial Hall, which is currently under preparation. The staff of the memorial hall took out many newspapers published by the party, government, military, trade union, and youth league organizations from 1931 to 1934, which were donated by the people of Ruijin after liberation, for me to see. From the news published in these newspapers, we can more clearly understand the living conditions of cadres and the masses, and the army and the people sharing weal and woe at that time. A "Red China" newspaper (the official newspaper of the former Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government), printed on ordinary rough-edged paper and published on December 5, 1933, had the entire front page devoted to comments and news about economy. An editorial praised the saving of food and the fact that some county, district, and township cadres brought their own meals and actively carried out work to support the Red Army; it also criticized individual cases of waste. In the bottom four columns of the same page, there was a piece of news criticizing the management section of the Central General Affairs Office for spending forty-five yuan to build a stage for evening performances. The news said: This kind of construction is unnecessary. A "Red Star Newspaper" (published by the Political Department of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army) published on March 25, 1934, also carried reports of Red Army cadres and soldiers saving food, clothing, and oil lamps, and of them reclaiming wasteland to grow vegetables themselves. I remember that a cadre of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government once told me: At that time, the grassroots cadres did not leave production, and the leading organs cadres and Red Army cadres lived a life of military communism. Therefore, the lives of workers and peasants were better than those of the cadres. I confirmed this situation in a "Soviet Area Worker" newspaper (the official newspaper of the Central Executive Bureau of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the Soviet Area) published on June 15, 1934. The newspaper reported that in order to share the hardships with the cadres and support the revolutionary war, the workers in the Soviet area enthusiastically proposed to reduce wages and waive wages, and implement the requirements for living supplies. They said: Every penny and every grain of rice must be subjected to the needs of the war.

After reading these newspapers, which recorded the glorious history of the Chinese revolution's arduous struggle, I deeply realized that today's revolutionary victory is the result of the common hard work of all revolutionary cadres and the masses of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party. However, the phenomena of asking for better treatment, competing for extravagance, and emphasizing ostentation that are growing in many organs and among cadres, this group of comrades has forgotten the glorious tradition of our party in terms of hard work and plain living. Starting a business requires hard work and plain living, and building a business requires even more hard work and plain living.

    永远要艰苦朴素
    新华社记者　岳革新
    记者在访问第二次国内革命战争时期中央工农民主政府所在地——瑞金县时，接触到很多前工农民主政府的工作人员和老红军干部、战士。他们在介绍自己过去的斗争经历时，都谈到当时全体革命干部与人民群众同甘共苦、艰苦奋斗粉碎反动派军事围剿和经济封锁的情形。前中央工农民主政府土地部工作人员、现任中共瑞金县象湖区委会书记黄子烇告诉我说：那时干部衣、食、住、行一切都和人民群众打成一片，没有一点特殊的地方。革命领袖的生活，也和普通人民一样的朴素。群众生活有困难，干部就节衣缩食帮助群众，群众也尽一切力量来支援革命战争。
    1月18日上午，记者随江西省赣南区革命老根据地视察团去中央工农民主政府所在地——叶坪村。在叶坪，一位六十多岁的老人领着我们去瞻仰中央工农民主政府总办公厅旧址、毛主席的故居。这位老人叫谢秀成，过去在地方工农民主政府工作过。总办公厅旧址是南方乡村中最常见的祠堂，1931年震动全国的第一次全国工农兵代表大会就是在这里举行的。会后，这里用木板隔成十六个房间，做了总办公厅。在总办公厅的右侧，我们瞻仰了毛主席故居。故居的建筑从室外看和村里所有的农家住宅一样，进门后才看到有东西厢房，旁边有楼梯上楼，确切地说，这里是不能被称为楼房的，楼很低，有些像搁楼。房子很小，一共有八间房和二个厅堂，厅堂的面积大约二十平方公尺，每间住房也只有十一、二平方公尺。谢秀成领着我们到楼上向南的一间住房里，他告诉我们：这就是毛主席的住房和办公室。房间里现在没有什么家具，但打扫得很干净。在向南的窗户上，大家发现下面用木板做了一个格子，谢秀成说：这就是毛主席放书用的。他还告诉我们：向北的那一间是周总理的住房和办公室；中间的小厅堂，就是当年中共中央政治局开会的地方。我们在瞻仰过这所简朴的小房后走下楼时，视察团团长、中共江西省委第一书记杨尚奎语重心长地说：“应该让年青的干部看看，才能知道过去革命的艰苦，学习这种光荣传统。”
    在这以前，记者还访问了正在筹备中的瑞金革命纪念馆。纪念馆工作人员拿出很多瑞金人民在解放后献出的1931至1934年党、政、军、工会、青年团组织领导出版的报纸给记者看。从这些报纸刊出的新闻中，可以更清楚的了解到当时干部和群众、军队和人民同甘共苦的生活状况。有一张用普通毛边纸印刷的1933年12月5日出版的“红色中华”报（前中央工农民主政府机关报），报纸头版的整版篇幅都刊载着关于节约的评论和消息。在一篇社论中表扬了节约粮食和一些县、区、乡干部为了支援红军，自带伙食积极进行工作的情形；也同时批评了个别浪费现象。在同版的下四栏，有一则消息是批评中央总务厅管理科人员用四十五元建筑一座供晚会表演用的戏台，消息说：这种建筑是不必要的。在一份1934年3月25日出版的“红星报”（中国工农红军政治部出版）上，也刊登有红军干部、战士节约粮食、衣服、油灯和他们自己开荒种菜的报道。记得有一位工农民主政府的干部告诉过我：当时的基层干部都不脱离生产，领导机关干部和红军干部过着军事共产主义的生活，因此，工农群众生活都比干部好。在一份1934年6月15日出版的“苏区工人”报（前中华全国总工会苏区中央执行局机关报）上，我证实了这种情形。报纸报道说：苏区工人为了与干部共艰苦，支援革命战争，都热烈地提出降低工资和免发工资，实行生活供给的要求。他们说：要把一文钱，一粒米都服从战争的需要。
    看完这些记载着中国革命艰苦斗争光荣史迹的报纸，使我深深地领悟到今天革命的胜利，是共产党领导全体革命干部与人民群众共同艰苦奋斗的成果。但目前在不少机关和干部中滋长着的闹待遇、比阔气、讲排场等以奢侈豪华为荣的情形，这部分同志忘记了我们党在艰苦朴素方面的光荣传统。创业需要艰苦朴素，建业更需要艰苦朴素。
