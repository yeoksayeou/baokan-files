    Reed Farms Should Not Be Converted into Agricultural Farms

    Given the tight supply of paper, how to meet the raw material needs of the paper industry is a problem that must be considered and resolved. However, the leadership departments in some places do not pay attention to the production of paper raw materials, and even convert existing reed farms into agricultural farms, resulting in a year-by-year decrease in reed production. For example, the state-owned Panjin Reed Farm in Liaoning Province is close to the Yingkou and Jinzhou state-owned paper mills, making on-site supply very convenient. The Panjin Reed Farm has also made long-term plans, expecting that by 1962, the annual output can be increased from the current 150,000 tons to 300,000 to 350,000 tons. This would not only meet the needs of the Yingkou and Jinzhou mills but also supply the Tianjin Paper Mill.

    However, since 1954, when this reed farm was transferred from the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry to the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture, the development of this reed farm has become a pipe dream. In 1956, the State-owned Farm Administration Bureau of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture decided to divide the Panjin Reed Farm into four reed farms and two stations. A month later, two of the reed farms were abolished and divided into nine agricultural farms. The agricultural farms focused on farmland, treating reeds as a sideline, and did not pay attention to reed production at all. In particular, some places one-sidedly emphasized increasing grain production, turning reed ponds into grain fields, resulting in a year-by-year decrease in reed production, which cannot meet the needs of papermaking. Now, the reeds needed by the Yingkou Paper Mill have to be transported from Heilongjiang, and some of the reeds needed by the Jinzhou Paper Mill have to be transported from Inner Mongolia. The reeds needed by the Tianjin Paper Mill are transported from as far away as Hunan. Such long-distance transportation not only increases the freight costs for paper mills and raises costs, but also increases the burden on railway transportation, causing considerable losses to the state.

    It is hoped that the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture will consider the overall situation and restore the Panjin Reed Farm.

### 不应该把苇场改作农场

    不应该把苇场改作农场
    在纸张供应紧张的情况下，如何满足造纸工业对原料的需要，是当前必须考虑解决的问题。可是，有些地方的领导部门，却不重视造纸原料的生产，甚至把原有的苇场改成农场，使芦苇产量逐年减少。如辽宁省的国营盘锦苇场接近营口、锦州两个国营纸厂，就地供应，很是方便。盘锦苇场并且作出了长远规划，预计到1962年，年产量可以由现在的十五万吨提到三十万吨至三十五万吨。不仅可以满足营口、锦州两厂需要，而且可以供应天津纸厂。
    但是，自从1954年这个苇场由轻工业部造纸工业管理局移交给辽宁省农业厅管理以后，这个苇场的发展就成了空想。1956年辽宁省农业厅国营农场管理局决定把盘锦苇场划分为四个苇场、两个站；过了一个月，又把其中两个苇场撤销分为九个农场。农场以农田为主，把芦苇当作副业，根本不重视芦苇的生产。特别是有些地方片面强调增产粮食，把苇塘开成粮田，使得芦苇产量逐年减少，不能满足造纸的需要。现在，营口纸厂所缺的苇子要从黑龙江调运，锦州纸厂有一部分苇子要从内蒙古运来；天津纸厂所缺的苇子更是远自湖南调运。这样长途运输，不仅使纸厂增加了运费、提高了成本，而且增加了铁路运输的负担，给国家带来的损失是不小的。
    希望辽宁省农业厅从全面考虑，把盘锦苇场恢复起来。从景林
