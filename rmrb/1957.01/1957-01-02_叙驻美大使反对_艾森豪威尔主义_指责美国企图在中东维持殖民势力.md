    Xinhua News Agency, January 1st, Washington Dispatch: Syrian Ambassador to the United States, Zeineddine, told reporters after visiting the State Department on December 31 that the Syrian government believes the rumored "Eisenhower Doctrine" is similar to proposals supported by Britain and France, which aim to maintain colonial influence in the Middle East.
    The ambassador said: The main reasons for the tensions in the Middle East are the activities and policies of colonialists and Zionist movements. "The so-called Soviet penetration in the Middle East is untrue; it is merely a superficial phenomenon to cover up the real situation."
    Zeineddine refuted the claim that the decline of British influence in the Middle East has created a "vacuum" in the region. He said there is no such "vacuum" because "nationalist power" has filled it.
    Zeineddine said he learned of the United States' new Middle East plan from American newspaper reports. He raised several "facts" to Assistant Secretary of State Rountree for the State Department's attention. He said that although the United States' new policy has not been formally announced, he felt that due to the "urgency" of the situation and its direct relationship to Syria, it was better for him to express his attitude.
    On December 30, Zeineddine also spoke to a United Press reporter on the same issue, accusing the United States of attempting to use "Cold War" tactics in the Middle East without considering the sentiments of the people in the Arab region.

    叙驻美大使反对“艾森豪威尔主义”
    指责美国企图在中东维持殖民势力
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：叙利亚驻美大使宰尼丁12月31日在访问国务院后对记者发表谈话说，叙利亚政府认为，传说中的“艾森豪威尔主义”是同英国和法国所支持的建议相似的，这些建议的目的是要维持在中东的殖民势力。
    这位大使说：造成中东紧张局势的主要原因是殖民主义者和犹太复国运动者的活动和政策。“所谓苏联在中东进行渗透的说法是不真实的，它只是为了要掩饰真实情况的一种外表现象。”
    宰尼丁驳斥了所谓由于英国在中东的影响消退而在这个地区造成“真空地带”的说法。他说，没有这样的“真空地带”，因为“民族主义的权力”已经填满了它。
    宰尼丁说，它从美国报纸报道中得悉了美国的新中东计划。他向助理国务卿朗特里提出若干“事实”请国务院注意。他说，虽然美国的新政策还没有正式宣布，他觉得由于情势“紧急”和直接关系到叙利亚，他还是宜于表明他的态度的。
    12月30日，宰尼丁还曾经就同一问题对合众社记者发表谈话，他在谈话里指责美国毫不考虑阿拉伯地区的人民的情绪，正在试图在中东使用“冷战”的策略。
