Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Telegram: More than 300 new water pumps have been installed in some of the rural areas of Hunan Province that were severely affected by drought last year, including Shaoyang, Chenxian, Hengyang, and Xiangtan Special Districts. At present, the province of Hunan has a total of 718 water pumps in rural areas, with a total of 17,735 horsepower.

The hundreds of water pumps put into production last year played a significant role in combating the severe drought. It is estimated that about one million mu of farmland in the province benefited from irrigation and drainage by water pumps last year, generally achieving good harvests. Among them, the 75 water pumps installed in Liling County increased grain production by 50 million jin for the 77,000 mu of land that directly and indirectly benefited. The paddy fields of Chuanxi Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County had very poor drought resistance conditions, with an average drought resistance capacity of only twelve or thirteen days in normal years. Last year, with the installation of water pumps, they still achieved a bumper harvest despite the severe drought, and the cooperative's total grain production increased by 500,000 jin compared to 1955.

    湖南部分受旱农村新安装三百多台抽水机
    新华社长沙电　湖南省邵阳、郴县、衡阳、湘潭等专区的部分去年受旱较重的农村，新安装了三百多台抽水机。现在，湖南全省农村已经拥有抽水机七百一十八台，共计一万七千七百三十五匹马力。
    去年投入生产的几百台抽水机，对抗御严重的干旱曾经起了不小的作用。总计全省去年利用抽水机灌溉和排渍的受益田共约一百万亩，一般都获得了丰收。其中醴陵县安装的七十五台抽水机，使直接和间接受益的七万七千多亩田增产粮食五千万斤。醴陵县氽溪农业社的稻田抗旱条件很差，常年的平均抗旱能力只有十二、三天，去年安装了抽水机，虽逢大旱，还是得到大丰收，全社粮食比1955年增产了五十万斤。
