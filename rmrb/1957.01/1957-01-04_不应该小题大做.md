    Don't Make a Mountain Out of a Molehill
    The Ganshui construction site of the No. 31 Engineering Area, Ganshui Town, Qijiang County, Sichuan Province, along the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, decided to detonate explosives to blast a mountain on November 30th from 1 to 2 pm. They notified all residents in the town that they must leave the blasting zone, 800 meters away, before 11:30 am that day. After receiving the notification, all government departments, organizations, and commercial sectors closed their doors and suspended operations on time, and the residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, went up the mountain to take shelter. As a result, the blasting was delayed until after 5 pm, causing many pedestrians and vehicles to be unable to pass, government offices unable to work, schools unable to hold classes, and shops unable to operate, leaving children crying from the cold. Therefore, the masses were in an uproar, saying, "This is a waste of manpower and money."
    In fact, this blasting only required fifty minutes, and the tremors were small, and the flying stones from the explosion landed very close by. Yet, they mobilized so many people to travel so far, causing the entire town's government offices, schools, and residents to waste six hours.
    Such a measure of making a mountain out of a molehill is truly undesirable.

    不应该小题大做
    川黔铁路四川省綦江县赶水镇三一工区赶水工地，确定在11月30日下午1至2时放炮炸山，他们曾通知全镇所有居民必须在当天上午十一时半以前离开爆破区八百公尺以外。各机关团体和商业部门接到通知后即按时关门停业，居民们也扶老携幼，上山避险。结果，一直拖延到下午五点多钟才放炮，结果使许多行人和车辆不能通行，使得机关不能办公，学校不能上课，商店不能营业，小孩冻得直哭。因此，群众议论纷纷，他们说：“这是劳民伤财”。
    其实，这次爆破只需五十分钟，而且震动很小，爆炸的飞石也很近，他们却动员那么多的人走那么远，使全镇机关、学校、居民浪费了六小时。
    这种小题大做的措施，实在是要不得的。
