Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd – Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Regarding the "Report on Riots in Kowloon and Tsuen Wan" by the British Authorities in Hong Kong. Full text as follows:

    On January 1, 1957, the British authorities in Hong Kong published the "Report on Riots in Kowloon and Tsuen Wan." In the report, the British authorities in Hong Kong still attempt to conceal the truth, exonerate Kuomintang secret agents of the crimes of planning and organizing the Kowloon riots, and shirk their own responsibility. The report also fails to provide responsible guarantees for the safety of life and property of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon in the future. The report also openly refers to the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan as the "National Government of Taiwan" and equates it with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. This once again exposes the British government's conspiracy to create "two Chinas." The Chinese government and people cannot but feel indignant about this and express their protest.

    The Kowloon riots that occurred in October 1956 were entirely planned and organized by Kuomintang secret agents. On the morning of October 10, Kuomintang secret agents used the incident of a junior official of the British authorities in Hong Kong tearing down a Kuomintang flag to start a pre-planned and organized riot. For several consecutive days, they carried out large-scale looting, killing, destruction, and arson against peaceful Chinese residents, industrial and commercial enterprises, and social organizations in Kowloon, causing significant casualties and losses to the lives and property of peaceful Chinese residents. This is a fact that is obvious to Chinese and foreign residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and it cannot be distorted by anyone at will.

    However, the British authorities in Hong Kong attribute the main responsibility for this riot to so-called general "Chinese refugees" and certain triads, thereby exonerating the Kuomintang secret agents who created this riot. Even the report itself, when describing the course of the riot, cannot but admit the following well-known facts: at the beginning of the flag-tearing incident in the Kowloon resettlement area, most of the people participating in the disturbance "included residents of the resettlement area who were believed to be Kuomintang members," and were subsequently "led by 14K and On Lok Triad members carrying Kuomintang flags," and divided into "groups holding Kuomintang flags" to carry out organized "mobile attacks"; while the 14K party that participated in the riot was a "semi-official political underground organization of the Kuomintang, and its members were mostly Kuomintang army personnel and junior officials." The riots in the Tsuen Wan area also proved to have been planned in advance by a series of secret meetings by Kuomintang secret agents. It is therefore clear that it is completely inconsistent with the facts to say that the riot incident has nothing to do with the local Kuomintang secret service organizations.

    It should be pointed out that this riot was not accidental. For a long time, the British authorities in Hong Kong have adopted a policy of protecting and conniving at the activities of Kuomintang secret agents in Hong Kong and Kowloon to harm peaceful Chinese residents and antagonize the People's Republic of China, making the Hong Kong and Kowloon area in fact a base for Kuomintang secret agents to carry out subversive activities against mainland China. Kuomintang secret agents have bombed planes of the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation, and have robbed fishing boats such as "Yu Jin," "Yu Yang," "Yu Lian," "Yu Pu," and "Yu Qiong." The British authorities in Hong Kong have never seriously arrested and brought the criminals to justice for these cases. Almost two years have passed since the "Kashmir Princess" plane sabotage case of April 11, 1955, which shocked China and foreign countries. The British authorities in Hong Kong have not only failed to bring the principal culprit to justice, but have instead released all the relevant suspects who were originally in custody. On January 31, 1956, a Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group F-86 fighter jet intruded into our country's airspace to harass and then fled to Hong Kong to land to avoid being pursued by our air force planes. Our ministry has protested to the British chargé d'affaires in Beijing, pointing out that the British authorities in Hong Kong have a responsibility to detain this combat plane and the personnel on board. However, the British government disregarded the legitimate demands of the Chinese government and actually allowed the personnel on the fighter jet to return to Taiwan, openly allowing Hong Kong to be used as a base and escape route for military sabotage activities against China. With the connivance of the British authorities in Hong Kong, Kuomintang secret service agencies have consistently used Hong Kong and Kowloon as a base for training secret agents and carrying out subversive activities against the People's Republic of China. The more than ten batches of Kuomintang secret agents who were recently uncovered, who conspired to carry out sabotage activities in Guangzhou on the evening of October 10, 1956, to support the Kowloon riots, had all received technical training in sabotage activities such as explosions, arson, distributing leaflets, and incitement in places such as the Dragon Wah Hotel on Jordan Road in Kowloon. It is precisely this consistent practice of the British authorities in Hong Kong of protecting and conniving at Kuomintang secret agents that has made their activities even more rampant. The Kowloon riots are precisely the result of this policy of the British authorities in Hong Kong. Therefore, the British authorities in Hong Kong cannot shirk the serious responsibility they should bear for this riot.

    The Chinese government and people are deeply concerned about the safety of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and will never tolerate Kuomintang secret agents carrying out activities in Hong Kong and Kowloon that endanger the lives and property of Chinese residents and using Hong Kong and Kowloon as a base for carrying out subversive activities against the Chinese mainland. The Chinese government and people resolutely demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately arrest and severely punish the Kuomintang secret agent ringleaders, provide compensation, condolences, and other aftercare to the affected Chinese residents, industrial and commercial enterprises, social organizations, etc., and earnestly ensure the safety of the lives and property of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and be responsible for ensuring that similar incidents do not occur again in the future.

    外交部就“九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”发表声明
    严斥香港英当局掩盖九龙暴乱真相
    决不能容忍国民党特务危害港九中国居民和利用港九作为颠覆活动基地
    新华社22日讯　中华人民共和国外交部关于香港英国当局“九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”的声明。全文如下：
    1957年1月1日香港英国当局发表了“九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”。在报告书里，香港英国当局仍然企图掩盖事实真相，洗刷国民党特务分子策划和组织九龙暴乱的罪行，推卸自己的责任。报告书对香港和九龙中国居民今后生命财产的安全亦未作出负责的保证。报告书中还公然称台湾蒋介石集团为“台湾国民政府”，并将它同中华人民共和国中央人民政府相提并论，这再一次暴露了英国政府制造“两个中国”的阴谋。中国政府和人民不能不对此感到愤慨并表示抗议。
    1956年10月发生的九龙暴乱事件，完全是国民党特务分子一手策划和组织的。10月10日上午，国民党特务分子利用香港英国当局一名下级官员撕去国民党旗帜的事件，开始了预先筹划的有组织的暴乱，对九龙的中国和平居民，工商企业和社会团体，进行了连续几天的大规模的抢劫、杀害、破坏和纵火，使中国和平居民的生命财产，遭受到重大的伤亡和损失。这是港九中外居民有目共睹的事实，决不是任何人所能肆意歪曲的。
    但是，香港英国当局却把这次暴乱的主要责任加于所谓一般的“中国难民”和某些帮会的头上，从而为制造这一暴乱的国民党特务分子开脱罪责。甚至连报告书本身在叙述这一暴乱经过的时候，也不能不承认这样一些众所周知的事实：在九龙徙置区发生撕旗事件之初，参加骚乱的人“大部包括徙置之居民被认为系国民党党员者”，其后由“携带国民党旗之14K党和安乐三合会会员率领”，分成“持有国民党旗之各组”，进行有组织的“流动性袭击”；而参加暴乱的14K党却是国民党“半官式政治性的地下组织，其会员多系国民党陆军人员及低级官吏”。而荃湾地区的暴乱，也证明是事先由国民党特务分子一连串秘密会议所策划的。由此可见，把暴乱事件说成同当地的国民党特务组织没有关系，那是完全同事实不符的。
    应当指出，这次暴乱并不是偶然的。长期以来，香港英国当局对国民党特务分子在港九地区进行危害中国和平居民和敌视中华人民共和国的活动一向采取包庇和纵容的态度，使港九地区事实上成为国民党特务分子对中国大陆进行颠覆活动的基地。国民党特务分子曾经爆炸过中国航空公司和中央航空公司的飞机，曾经劫夺过“渔晋”、“渔杨”、“渔连”、“渔浦”、“渔琼”等渔船。对于这些案件，香港英国当局从未认真地将罪犯逮捕法办。1955年4月11日震动中外的“克什米尔公主号”飞机破坏案至今将近两年，香港英国当局不但未使首犯归案法办，相反地，却把原在扣押中的有关案犯全部释放。1956年1月31日台湾蒋介石集团F—86型战斗机窜入我国领土上空进行骚扰后为逃避我空军飞机追击而逃到香港降落。我部曾照会英国驻北京代办，指出香港英国当局有责任把这一作战飞机和机上人员予以扣留，但是，英国政府却不顾中国政府的正当要求，竟然将该战斗机上的人员放回台湾，公然容许香港被利用为对中国进行军事破坏活动的基地和逃避的场所。国民党特务机关在香港英国当局的纵容之下，还一贯利用港九作为训练特务和对中华人民共和国进行颠覆活动的基地。不久以前破获的，阴谋在1956年10月10日晚上在广州进行破坏活动以策应九龙暴乱的十多批国民党特务分子，都曾先后在九龙佐敦道龙华酒店等处，受到爆炸、放火、散发传单、进行煽动等破坏活动的技术训练。正是香港英国当局这种一贯包庇和纵容国民党特务分子的做法，使他们的活动更加猖獗。九龙暴乱事件正是香港英国当局这种政策所造成的结果。因此香港英国当局决不能推诿对这次暴乱事件所应负的严重责任。
    中国政府和人民深切关怀港九同胞的安全，决不能容忍国民党特务分子在港九地区进行危害中国居民生命财产的活动和把港九作为对中国大陆进行颠覆活动的基地。中国政府和人民坚决要求香港英国当局立即逮捕和严惩国民党特务祸首，对于受害的中国居民、工商企业、社会团体等进行赔偿、抚恤和其他善后处理，并切实保障港九中国居民生命财产的安全，负责保证以后不再发生类似事件。
