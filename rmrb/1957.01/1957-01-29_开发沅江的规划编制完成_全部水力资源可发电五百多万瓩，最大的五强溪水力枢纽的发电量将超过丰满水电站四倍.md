Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 28th -- The Yuan River possesses abundant hydropower resources, with a total potential generating capacity of over 5 million kilowatts. This is according to the recently completed planning report for the development of the Yuan River basin. The basin planning report for the development of the Yuan River was compiled after five years of arduous work by a large number of hydropower field survey and design personnel, under the guidance of Soviet experts, starting with surveys in 1952 and compilation in 1955.

The Yuan River originates from Yunwu Mountain on the Guizhou Plateau, flows through the vast area of western Hunan, and enters the Yangtze River via Dongting Lake. Most of the basin is mountainous with abundant rainfall, and with its high source and rapid flow, the hydropower is extremely rich. During the rainy seasons of summer and autumn, mountain floods frequently occur, easily causing flooding in the middle and lower reaches and the Dongting Lake area; exceptionally large floods even threaten cities along the Yangtze River such as Hankou and Huangshi. The main aim of the development plan is to eliminate the threat of flooding to downstream areas, and to utilize hydropower for electricity generation, as well as to improve navigation and irrigation and drainage. The plan divides the Yuan River's main and tributary streams into twenty-seven tiers, intending to transform this rapid mountain stream into a series of valley reservoirs for flood control, power generation, and navigation. After the plan is realized, the electricity generated by the Yuan River can fully meet the industrial needs of Central China for a considerable period, and a portion can also be sent to East China. Hundreds of tons of ships can also travel directly from Changde on the shores of Dongting Lake to eastern Guizhou and the border of Sichuan.

The first project proposed in the plan is the Wuqiangxi Hydropower Hub, located between Yuanling and Taoyuan counties. This is the largest of the twenty-seven tiers on the Yuan River, with good geological and topographical conditions suitable for building a high dam. Once the high dam is built, it can control 93% of the entire Yuan River basin. Currently, more than 600 geological survey and design personnel are taking advantage of the dry winter season to conduct drilling and geological surveys day and night in the riverbed and heart of the river within an eleven-kilometer section near Wuqiangxi, planning to submit basic data for selecting a dam site by the end of the first half of the year. According to the comparative plans proposed in the planning report, this hydropower hub will include a concrete gravity dam approximately 500 meters long and over 120 meters high, and a rockfill dam approximately 300 meters long and over 150 meters high. When the dam overflows with floodwaters, the water flows down from the more than 100-meter-high spillway, and the spray it splashes can turn the area within several hundred meters into a sea of fog, and the roar of the waterfall can be heard from a great distance. The power generation of this hydropower hub is expected to be four times greater than that of the current largest Fengman Hydropower Station in China, and it can be compared to the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station in the Soviet Union.

### 开发沅江的规划编制完成  全部水力资源可发电五百多万瓩，最大的五强溪水力枢纽的发电量将超过丰满水电站四倍

    开发沅江的规划编制完成
    全部水力资源可发电五百多万瓩，最大的五强溪水力枢纽的发电量将超过丰满水电站四倍
    新华社长沙28日电　沅江蕴藏着丰富的水力资源，全部利用发电可达五百多万瓩。这是最近完成的开发沅水流域规划报告提出的。开发沅江的流域规划报告是大批水电野外勘测和设计人员在苏联专家指导下，从1952年开始勘测，1955年开始编制，前后经过五年的艰苦劳动才编制好的。
    沅江发源于贵州高原云雾山，流经湘西广大地区由洞庭湖入长江。流域大部是山地，雨量充沛，加以源高流急，水力极为丰富。每年夏秋多雨季节，山洪暴发，容易酿成中、下游和洞庭湖区的洪水泛滥；洪水特大时并威胁长江沿岸汉口、黄石等城市。开发规划主要在于消除下游地区所受的洪水威胁，并利用水力发电以及改善航运同灌溉排渍。规划把沅江的干支流分作二十七个梯级，拟把这条山间急流变作一连串的山谷水库，用以蓄洪、发电和通航。规划实现后，沅江所发的电可以完全满足华中地区相当长的时间内工业的需要，一部分并可送到华东地区。几百吨的轮船也能从洞庭湖滨的常德直放贵州东部和四川边境。
    规划提出建筑的第一个工程是位于沅陵、桃源两县之间的五强溪水力枢纽。这里是沅江的二十七个梯级中最大的一个梯级，地质地形条件都好，适于建筑高坝。高坝筑成，就能控制沅江全流域的93％。目前六百多地质勘测设计人员正利用冬季水枯时机，在五强溪附近十一公里地段河滩和河心中日夜进行钻探及地质勘测，计划在上半年末提出选择坝址的基本资料。根据规划报告所提出的比较方案，这个水力枢纽将包括长约五百公尺，高约一百二十几公尺的混凝土重力坝，及长约三百公尺、高约一百五十多公尺的堆石坝。大坝溢放洪水时，水从一百多公尺高的溢洪道上流下来，它溅起的水沫可使几百公尺以内变成一个雾海，而在很远的地方就可听到瀑布的吼声。这个水力枢纽的发电量预计比目前我国最大的丰满水电站大四倍，可以和苏联的古比雪夫水电站媲美。
