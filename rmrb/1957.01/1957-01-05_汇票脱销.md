    "Money Order Shortage"
    I have never heard of a money order shortage. But in Shangdu Xianghuang Banner Post Office in Inner Mongolia, money orders really "ran out." When people went to remit money, the answer they received was: "Money orders have been out of stock for several days, send an insured letter!"
    What's going on? It turned out that a large number of money orders were locked in the Shangdu Xianghuang Banner Post Office's filing cabinet. It wasn't until they telegraphed to their superiors to urge the dispatch of money orders, and the superiors said that they had already sent the money orders to you, that they were found in the filing cabinet.

    “汇票脱销”
    从来没有听说过汇票脱销的事情。但在内蒙古商都镶黄旗邮局里，汇票真的“脱销”了。人们去汇款，得到的答复是：“汇票脱销好几天了，寄保价信吧！”
    这是怎么回事呢？原来是大量汇票被锁在商都镶黄旗邮局的卷柜里，直到他们打电报向上级催发汇票，上级说早就把汇票发给你们了，才从卷柜里找了出来。
