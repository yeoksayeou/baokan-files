More advantages or more disadvantages?

Jin Sha

Are there more advantages or more disadvantages to larger institutions? Some might say: this isn't even a question. According to the reporter's understanding, it is still a question, and it is hindering the work of streamlining institutions.

Hebei Province has different opinions on the expansion of certain institutions and the increase in personnel. For example, some say: Hebei's First and Second Industry Bureaus should not have been separated, while others say: the separation of the First and Second Industry Bureaus is correct, and the reason is: it is beneficial to the work.

Before the separation of the Hebei First and Second Industry Bureaus, as some people said, they had to manage both heavy industry and light industry, which inevitably led to a phenomenon of neglecting one for the other. After the separation, one bureau manages heavy industry and the other manages light industry, which is much easier. As some leaders said, it is also much easier to hold a bureau affairs meeting. After the separation of the bureaus, there were indeed considerable improvements in leadership work. After the establishment of the Second Industry Bureau, the industrial management policy of professional management and classified guidance was better implemented. From June to December of last year, the Second Industry Bureau successively held 30 various professional meetings. Through these meetings, some industry process regulations, operating procedures, quality standards, and other technical measures were formulated and revised, improving the management and technical level of enterprises. At the same time, problems that had not been noticed or well resolved in the past have been solved or are being solved; due to the strengthening of professional management, product quality has continuously improved in the past six months, with 70% of the 31 types of products showing significant improvement or are stabilizing.

There is also another advantage: leaders have more time to delve into their work. Wang Yizhi, Deputy Director of the Hebei First Industry Bureau, said: he was against the separation of the bureaus at the time of the split, but now he is against merging them. He said: At that time, he thought that the separation of the bureaus would increase a lot of personnel; now he thinks that although the separation of the bureaus has increased a lot of personnel, there are many advantages. The biggest advantage is that leaders can conduct more in-depth and specific leadership and delve into their work. He cited himself as an example. He is responsible for production technology work. Before the separation of the bureaus, there were too many affairs to manage this and that, so he had little time to delve into his work. After the separation of the bureaus, the situation is different, and he has time to delve into his work.

This is the case for engineering and technical personnel, and it is also the case for general leaders. The principle is very simple: it is easier to manage one department well than to manage two departments, and it is easier to delve into one problem deeply than to delve into two problems.

Although there are many advantages, institutions and personnel should still be expanded according to the actual situation. Now, the expansion of many institutions and the increase in personnel have exceeded actual needs. Taking the Hebei First and Second Industry Bureaus as an example again. There are many advantages to the separation of the bureaus, but many disadvantages have also been exposed. Recently, Hebei Daily exposed the following situations: The First and Second Industry Bureaus both have separate statistics, supply and marketing, personnel, finance, labor organization, education, and other bureaus and departments. In addition to these comprehensive bureaus and departments, each professional bureau also has small units with similar names. For example, the machinery, mining, textile, and food bureaus all have managers (supply and marketing and finance), statistics, secretaries (information), and personnel education, labor organization, and other sections (groups) or full-time cadres. This means that there used to be only one set of such organizations, but now there are several sets of such organizations. As a result, some people will certainly have nothing to do. Wang Junying of the Personnel and Education Group of the Geological Department of the First Bureau said: "There are two people in our group, and we have not had any work to do. In the past three months, we have only done two things: replied to a letter from the masses and sent a registration form to the geological team." Liu Ruifen was borrowed from the geological team and assigned to the secretarial group to do mail and manage book lending (there are only about 100 books). Originally, the workload was not large, but in order to take care of the emotions of another comrade in the group who had nothing to do, the book work managed by Liu Ruifen was assigned to him. The other three staff members of this group also read books and newspapers because they did not have much work to do.

In the commercial system, also because of the one-sided emphasis on the finer the division of labor the better, blindly expanding institutions and increasing personnel, the result was also bloated institutions and overstaffing. The wholesale and retail business of coal, cigarettes, alcohol, oils, food, cultural goods, and Chinese medicine, which were originally uniformly operated and handled by department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives, have now been separately established as companies and wholesale groups and retail outlets for independent operation. After receiving the task of purchasing cotton and hemp, the Xingtai Special District Purchasing Bureau in Hebei established purchasing organizations in various counties and townships. For this reason, in addition to receiving 1,800 staff members transferred from the supply and marketing cooperatives, the bureau added 3,200 more. In addition, the cotton and hemp purchasing work is seasonal, and the purchasing work is mainly carried out within six months from September of this year to February of the following year. For the six months from March to August, there is nothing to do. As the local people said, they "slept their heads flat, collapsed the bed, and broke the poker."

The "downward extension points" of various commercial companies are also not established according to actual needs. There is such a situation in Ding County. The county originally had seven grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and 216 distribution points. From the current situation, they can already undertake all the wholesale and retail businesses in rural areas. However, various companies have to "extend downward," and a number of wholesale groups, retail stores, and purchasing stations have been added to various towns and townships. According to incomplete statistics, personnel have increased by more than 500 as a result.

Bloated institutions and overstaffing are not only detrimental to work but also increase a large amount of state expenditure.

When talking about increasing state expenditure, a commercial staff member once said: The salaries of staff members in the commercial sector are paid from operating expenses. This means that it will not increase state expenditure. This statement is incorrect. The commercial sector is to accumulate funds for the country. Many commercial departments have not only failed to accumulate funds for the country because of their large institutions and overstaffing but have also lost a lot of money. The 158 coal selling points "extended downward" by the Xingtai Special District Coal and Construction Company lost 39,000 yuan. Since its official establishment in October last year, the Ding County Cultural Goods Company lost 1,200 yuan in the first month and 2,700 yuan in the second month.

Although the number of staff members in various units has greatly increased, the staff members are relatively dispersed, with many offices having only three or four people. For example, in the 17 offices of the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, half of them have three or fewer staff members. The people's committees of various counties in this special zone also have the phenomenon of dispersed forces. Excessive dispersion of personnel will lead to an uneven distribution of workload. When there are relatively major work tasks, some agencies have to concentrate a group of forces to organize temporary offices to cope. The Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office organized 12 temporary offices last year. These include: Wage Reform Office, District and Township Merger Office, Production Competition Office, Illiteracy Elimination Office, Oil Crop Production Increase Office, Agricultural Tool Production Office, Transportation Office, etc. There are also many temporary offices in the county. The organization of temporary offices is certainly not entirely due to insufficient manpower in various sections and offices, but insufficient manpower is indeed one of the important reasons. Some agencies have to borrow staff members from lower-level organizations.

This phenomenon also exists in the commercial system. The entire commercial work of Dongting Town in Ding County was originally undertaken by the supply and marketing cooperative, but now it is divided into many stalls. Although the number of staff members has increased compared to the past, they are dispersed to various stalls.

The leading agencies are constantly expanding, and they are constantly drawing staff members from lower-level organizations and grassroots organizations. In the past year, Hebei Province transferred a total of 519 cadres to the central government (including those assigned to other provinces by the central government), plus 346 who moved their jobs with their spouses, totaling 865. The Hebei Provincial organs transferred 1,732 cadres from special districts and counties. According to what is already known, there are 197 county-level cadres and 678 district-level cadres among them. The county will of course also draw a group of cadres from districts and townships to replenish its own institutions.

The frequent transfer of staff members, coupled with the poor work of cultivating cadres, has gradually weakened the leadership strength at the grassroots level. Although Xijianyang Township in Ding County is a large township merged from three townships, compared with the situation before the district and township merger, the quality of the staff members has not improved. Except for the original instructor stationed in this township who was changed to the secretary of the township's party grassroots committee, the rest are the staff members of the original small township. The situation in other townships is also the same.

Once the institution is large and there are many people, originally simple things become complicated. Sending a document externally requires going through many levels. After being drafted by a clerk, it is sent to the group leader, section chief, department secretary, department director, bureau secretary, bureau director, and department director. After being circulated, it takes half a month. If there are revisions, it takes even longer. The Hebei Provincial Finance Department, Water Conservancy Department, and Industry Department sometimes take one or two months to respond to requests from below.

With large and many institutions, there are also more meetings. Unit A holds a socialist activist conference, and Unit B also holds a socialist activist conference. Unit C catches up, and Unit D does not lag behind. Hebei Province held many socialist activist conferences last year. There are also many other meetings, professional meetings, enlarged meetings.... According to statistics from the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, there were a total of 320 large and small meetings approved by the Provincial People's Committee and the Governor last year, with each meeting attended by 60 to 1,000 people. Every special district, city, and county has four to six people attending meetings in the province every day.

There are also many meetings in the county. When the reporter was in Ding County, the county was holding four meetings of different natures, and five staff members from Xijianyang Township were attending meetings in the county.

Are there more advantages or more disadvantages? Isn't this very clear?

    好处多还是坏处多
    金沙
    机构大了好处多还是坏处多？有人可能会说：这就不是一个问题。据记者了解，这还是一个问题，而且它正在阻碍着精简机构工作的进行。
    河北省对某些机构的扩大和人员的增多，就有着不同的意见。举例说：有人说：河北第一、二工业厅不应该分设，也有人说：第一、二工业厅分设是对的，理由却都是：对工作有利。
    河北第一、二工业厅分厅以前，正如某些人说的，既要管理重工业，又要管理轻工业，不免有顾此失彼的现象。分厅以后，一个厅管理重工业，一个厅管理轻工业，容易得多。也就如有的领导人员说的，开个厅务会议，也方便得多。在分厅以后，在领导工作上确有不小的改进。第二工业厅成立以后，更好地贯彻了专业管理、分类指导的工业管理方针。从去年6月到12月，第二工业厅先后召开了各种专业会议三十次。通过这些会议制订和修订了一些行业的工艺规程、操作规程、质量标准和其他一些技术措施，提高了企业管理水平和技术水平。同时，历年来没注意到或未很好解决的问题，已经解决或正在解决；由于加强了专业管理，半年来产品质量就不断地提高，在三十一种产品中，有70％有显著的提高或正在稳定。
    还有个好处：领导人员有比较充裕的时间来钻研业务了。河北第一工业厅王以秩副厅长说：在分厅时，他是反对分厅的，但是现在他又反对合厅。他说：那时，他想到分厅以后，就会增加不少人员；现在他想分厅虽然增加了不少人员，但有不少好处。其中最大一个好处是领导人员可以进行比较深入具体的领导和钻研业务了。他以自己为例子。他是负责生产技术工作的，没有分厅以前，事务太多，这样也要管，那样也要管，就没有多少时间来钻研业务。分厅以后，情况就不同，有了钻研业务的时间。
    对工程技术人员是如此，对一般领导人员也是如此。这个道理很简单，管理一个部门要比管理两个部门容易管理得好，钻研一个问题要比钻研两个问题容易钻研得深。
    虽然有不少好处，但是仍然应该根据实际情况来扩大机构，增加人员。现在有许多机构的扩大和人员的增加，就超过了实际的需要。仍以河北第一、二工业厅为例。分厅以后是有不少的好处，但是也暴露出许多坏处。最近河北日报就揭发了这样一些情况：第一、二工业厅都分别设有统计、供销、人事、财务、劳动组织、教育等局处。在这些综合局、处以外，各专业局内又分别设有这类名称的科组小单位。如机械、矿务、纺织、食品等局都设有经理（供销和财务）、计统、秘书（资料）以及人事教育、劳动组织等科（组）或专职干部。这就是说，过去只有一套这样的组织，现在有几套这样的组织。结果，有些人当然会没有事情可做。第一厅地质处人事教育组王俊英说：“我们这组有两个人，一直没工作做。近三个月来只做了两件事：答复了一封群众来信，向地质队发了一张登记表。”刘瑞芬是由地质队借来的，被分配到秘书组做收发工作兼管图书借阅工作（图书共有一百来本）。本来工作量不大，但为了照顾组内另一个无事可干的同志的情绪，又把刘瑞芬管的图书工作分给他去做。这个组的另外三个工作人员，也因为没有多少工作可做，就看书、读报。
    在商业系统，也因为片面地强调分工越细越好，盲目扩大机构，增加人员，结果，也出现了机构臃肿，人浮于事的现象。原来由百货公司和供销社统一经营和代办的煤、烟酒、油脂、食品、文化用品、中药等批发业务和零售业务，现在都分别成立了公司和设立了批发组、零售点单独经营。河北邢台专区采购局接收棉麻收购工作任务后，即在各县、乡建立采购组织。为此，这个局除了接收从供销社转来的一千八百个工作人员外，又增加了三千二百名。加上收购棉麻工作是有季节性，收购工作主要是在本年的9月到第二年的2月六个月内。3月到8月这六个月，没有事情可做，就像当地群众说的，他们“睡扁了头，压塌了床，打烂了扑克。”
    各个商业公司的“下伸点”，也不是根据实际需要来建立的。定县就有这种情况。这个县本来有七个基层供销社，二百十六个分销点，从目前情况来看，已经可以担负起乡村的全部批发、零售等业务。但是各公司都要“下伸”，各镇、乡就增加了一批批发组、零售店、收购站等组织。据不完全统计，人员却因此增加了五百多。
    机构臃肿，人浮于事，不仅对工作不利，而且增加了国家大量开支。
    谈到增加国家开支时，曾有一个商业工作人员这样说：商业部门的工作人员的工资是用事业费开支的。这意思是说：不会增加国家开支。这种说法是不对的。商业部门是为国家积累资金的。许多商业部门因为机构庞大，人浮于事，不仅没有为国家积累资金，而且赔了不少钱。邢台专区煤建公司“下伸”的一百五十八个售煤点，就赔了三万九千元。定县文化用品公司，去年10月份正式成立以来，第一个月赔一千二百元，第二个月赔二千七百元。
    各个单位的工作人员虽然都有很大的增加，但是工作人员却又相对地分散，许多科室只有三、四个人。例如邯郸专署十七个科室中，有三个工作人员以下的就有一半。这个专区的各县人民委员会，同样有力量分散的现象。人员过于分散，就会出现忙闲不均的现象。在有了比较重大的工作任务时，有些机关不得不集中一批力量组织临时性的办公室来应付。邯郸专署去年一年就曾组织过十二个临时性的办公室。这里边有：工资改革办公室、撤区并乡办公室、生产竞赛办公室、扫除文盲办公室、增产油料作物办公室、农具生产办公室、交通运输办公室等。县的临时性办公室也是不少的。组织临时性办公室当然不完全因为各科、室人力不够，但是人力不够确是重要原因之一。有些机关不得不向下级组织借用工作人员。
    在商业系统中也有这种现象。定县东亭镇的全部商业工作原来由供销社担负，现在则分成好多摊子。工作人员虽然比前增多了，但是分散到各个摊子去了。
    领导机关不断地扩大，就不断地从下级组织、从基层组织中抽调工作人员。河北省去年一年，调往中央（包括由中央分配到其他省份的）共五百一十九名干部，加上随爱人一起调动工作的三百四十六名，共八百六十五名。河北省级机关从专、县上调了一千七百三十二名干部。据已经知道的，其中有县级干部一百九十七名，区级干部六百七十八名。县当然也会从区、乡抽调一批干部，充实自己的机构。
    工作人员经常上调，加上培养干部的工作不大好，基层的领导力量就逐渐减弱了。定县西建阳乡，虽然是三个乡合并的大乡，但是同撤区并乡以前情况比较，工作人员的质量并没有提高，除了原驻这个乡的指导员改任乡的党的基层委员会书记外，其余都是原来小乡的工作人员。其他乡的情况也是如此。
    机构一大，人员一多，本来很简单的事情，就变得复杂起来。向外发一个公文，要经过许多道关口，由干事起草后，送组长、科长、处秘书、处长、局秘书、局长、厅长，传阅完毕，就得半个月时间。要有修改的话，则时间更长。河北财政厅、水利厅、工业厅对下边来的请示文件，有时得一两个月才能作出答复来。
    机构大了多了，会议也多起来了。甲单位开了一个社会主义积极分子大会，乙单位也来开个社会主义积极分子大会，丙单位迎头赶上，丁单位也不落后。河北省去年就召开了不少社会主义积极分子大会。其他会议也多，专业会议、扩大会议……。据河北省人民委员会统计：去年经省人民委员会和省长批准的大小会议共有三百二十次，每次参加会议的人从六十人到一千人。每个专区、市、县，每天都有四人至六人在省里开会。
    县的会议也不少。记者在定县时，县里正召开四种不同性质的会议，西建阳乡就有五个工作人员在县里参加会议。
    好处多呢还是坏处多呢？这不是很清楚了吗？
