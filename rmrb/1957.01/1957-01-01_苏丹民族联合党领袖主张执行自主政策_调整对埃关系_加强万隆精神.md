Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 31st - According to a report from the Middle East News Agency, the Sudanese National Unionist Party held a reception in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, on December 27th to celebrate Egypt's recovery of Port Said.

In his speech at the meeting, the leader of the National Unionist Party, Ismail al-Azhari, said: "We regard Egypt as our first line of defense, and believe that any violation of Egypt's freedom and independence is a violation of our own freedom and independence."

At the meeting, Azhari announced a resolution passed by the party, which demanded:

	1. Conclude a treaty with Egypt;
	2. Adjust Sudan's political relations with all countries, especially with Egypt;
	3. Free Sudan's economy from the control of imperialist countries;
	4. Oppose aggressive treaties and strive to strengthen the spirit of the Bandung Conference.

Azhari emphasized the need to reconsider Sudan's political and economic relations with Britain. He said that Sudan should pursue an independent policy.

Azhari expressed his opposition to the Baghdad Pact because "this treaty consolidates foreign forces and is likely to lead to war."

(Editor's note) The Sudanese National Unionist Party is a national bourgeois political party and was formerly the ruling party. The predecessor of this party was the "Brothers Party," which consistently advocated for the merger of Sudan and Egypt, believing that the unification of the Nile River basin was the way to achieve Sudan's independence. After Egypt announced the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1951, the "Brothers Party" organized the "National Front," advocating for uniting all forces to cooperate with Egypt to force Britain to withdraw from Sudan. In 1952, during the British-Egyptian negotiations on the Sudan issue, the "Brothers Party" united several parties to form the National Unionist Party, becoming the most powerful nationalist party in Sudan. The leader of this party is former Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari.

    苏丹民族联合党领袖主张执行自主政策
    调整对埃关系　加强万隆精神
    据新华社开罗31日电　据中东通讯社报道，苏丹民族联合党12月27日在苏丹首都喀土穆举行了一次招待会，庆祝埃及收复塞得港。
    民族联合党领袖伊斯梅尔·阿扎里在会上讲话时说：“我们把埃及看成是我们的第一道防线，并且认为对埃及的自由和独立的任何侵犯就是对我们自己的自由和独立的侵犯。”
    阿扎里在会上宣布了这个党所通过的一项决议，决议要求：
    一、同埃及缔结一项条约；
    二、调整苏丹同一切国家的政治关系，首先是同埃及的关系；
    三、把苏丹的经济从帝国主义国家的控制下解脱出来；
    四、反对侵略条约，为加强万隆会议的精神而努力。
    阿扎里着重指出，有必要重新考虑苏丹同英国的政治和经济关系。他说，苏丹应该执行一种自主的政策。
    阿扎里表示反对巴格达条约，因为“这项条约巩固了外国的势力，并且很可能会导致战争”。
      （编者注）　苏丹民族联合党是民族资产阶级政党，曾为执政党。这个党的前身是“兄弟党”，一贯主张苏丹同埃及合并，认为尼罗河流域的统一是达成苏丹独立的途径。1951年埃及宣布废除英埃条约后，“兄弟党”组织了“民族阵线”，主张团结一切力量争取同埃及合作，迫使英国撤出苏丹。1952年在英、埃谈判苏丹问题过程中，“兄弟党”联合几个党派，组成了民族联合党成为苏丹最有势力的民族主义政党。这个党的领袖是前任总理伊斯梅尔·阿扎里。
