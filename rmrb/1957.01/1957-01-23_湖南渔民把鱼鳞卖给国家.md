Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 22nd -- Fishermen in Hunan Province are selling large quantities of fish scales to the state for the first time.

Fish scale glue, made from fish scales, is an important raw material for manufacturing photographic film and movie copies. Previously, this raw material relied on imports from foreign countries. Now, China can manufacture it itself. According to investigations by purchasing departments, the annual purchase of fish scales in Hunan, the "land of fish and rice," will be more than 10,000 dan.
