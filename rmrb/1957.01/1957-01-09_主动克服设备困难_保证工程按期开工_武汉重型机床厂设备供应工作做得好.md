Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant has actively strengthened its equipment supply work, and many difficult problems have been resolved.

In the equipment supply work, the factory, on the one hand, signed equipment ordering contracts with relevant factories based on the expanded preliminary design. At the same time, it also copied the technical requirements and relevant data of the orders to the design department, asking them to offer opinions and promptly make changes if necessary. As a result, the hundreds of major equipment ordered last year completely avoided the phenomenon of backlog due to non-compliance with specifications, ensuring the needs of many important projects to start on schedule or ahead of schedule.

The factory also continuously delved into manufacturing factories to discover and solve problems, and organized relevant factories to cooperate in production according to needs and possibilities. For example, high-voltage isolating switches were originally planned to be manufactured by the Fushun Electric Porcelain Factory, but because this factory had difficulties in assembly, it could not manufacture complete sets. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant sent personnel to learn about the situation from various sources and found that the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory still had surplus assembly capacity, so it came forward to organize the two factories to cooperate in production. Some equipment seemed impossible to produce domestically, but after learning about it from various sources, it was found that it might be possible to find ways to produce it. For example, they selected thirty-two suitable heavy machine tools from the state's inventory equipment, which not only ensured the needs of the project but also saved the country more than 7 million yuan in foreign exchange.

    主动克服设备困难　保证工程按期开工
    武汉重型机床厂设备供应工作做得好
    据新华社武汉8日电　武汉重型机床厂积极加强设备供应工作，许多困难问题得到解决。
    在设备供应工作中，这个工厂一方面根据扩大初步设计同有关工厂签定设备订货合同，同时又把订货的技术要求和有关资料抄送给设计部门，要他们提出意见，要更改的就及时更改。这样作的结果，使去年订用的几百台主要设备完全避免了因为不合规格而产生积压的现象，保证了许多重要工程按期或提前施工的需要。
    这个工厂还不断地深入承制工厂发现和解决问题，并且根据需要和可能组织有关工厂协作生产。如高压隔离开关，原打算由抚顺电瓷厂承制，但因为这个厂在装配方面有困难，不能成套制造。武汉重型机床厂派出人员多方了解，发现沈阳高压开关厂还有多余的装配能力，于是就出面组织了这两个工厂协作生产。有些设备，看来国内是不能生产的，可是经多方了解以后却发现可能想办法生产。例如他们从国家库存设备中选出了三十二台合用的重型机床，不但保证了工程的需要，还为国家节约了七百多万元的外汇。
