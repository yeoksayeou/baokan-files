    I am willing to return to the countryside again

    Editor:
    I was originally the Deputy Secretary of the Wanliang District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Fusong County, Jilin Province. Last September, due to the merging of districts and townships, I was transferred to the Organization Department of the Prefectural Committee. Recently, I saw in the People's Daily that many leading organs are sending a large number of district-level cadres who originally worked in rural areas back to the countryside, and I very much support this practice. At the same time, I am also willing to return to the countryside.

    Editor, I have been working in rural areas since 1951. Over the years, I have been with the vast number of farmers and have established close ties with them. In the great cooperative movement, I made up my mind to contribute all my strength to building socialist agriculture.

    But since the merging of districts and townships, except for one or two district cadres who remained in the township to serve as general branch secretaries, the rest have been transferred to county and prefectural committee organs, especially district cadres above the level of district committee members, almost all have been transferred. At present, more than 80% of the cadres in the townships have been promoted from village cadres or middle and primary school graduates. They have little experience and weak capabilities, and coupled with the heavy tasks of rural work at present, these township cadres feel many difficulties, and rural work cannot be carried out normally.

    On the other hand, the cadres who have been transferred up also feel depressed due to their unfamiliarity with the work. I think: If I were asked to return to the countryside, that would be great. I express to the Party and the people that I am willing to return to the countryside and specifically lead the agricultural cooperation movement. I am not afraid of difficulties or hardships, and I am determined and confident to contribute my greatest strength to the socialist construction of agriculture.

    Liu Dianxiang, Cadre of the Organization Department of the Tonghua Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China

### 我愿意再回到农村去

    我愿意再回到农村去
    编辑同志：
    我原来是中共吉林省抚松县万良区委会的副书记。去年9月间，由于撤区并乡被调到地委组织部来了。最近我在人民日报上看到很多领导机关，将大批原来作农村工作的区级干部，又派到农村去了，这种作法我非常拥护。同时我也愿意再回到农村去。
    编辑同志，我从1951年就开始作农村工作，几年以来，我一直和广大农民在一起，和农民建立了亲密的联系。在伟大的合作化运动中，我更下定了决心，为建设社会主义的农业，贡献出自己的全部力量。
    但自从撤区并乡以后，区干部中除留下一、二名在乡里担任总支书记外，其余的都上调到县委和地委其他机关中去了，特别是区委委员以上的区干部，差不多都上调了。目前乡里的干部，80％以上都是从村干部或中、小学毕业生中提拔起来的。他们经验少，能力弱，再加当前农村工作任务繁重，就使这些乡干部感到困难不少，农村工作不能正常地开展。
    另一方面，被抽调上来的干部，也因业务生疏，感到苦闷。我想：如果再叫我回到农村去的话，那该多么好，我向党、向人民表示，我愿意再回到农村中去，具体领导农业合作化运动，我不怕困难、不怕艰苦，有决心和信心为农业社会主义建设贡献出我最大的力量。
    中共吉林省通化地委组织部干事  刘殿祥
