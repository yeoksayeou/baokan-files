    Smoked Chair
    The famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhao Bingnan at the Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital has begun using a "smoked chair" to treat patients with skin diseases. This is the first medical device manufactured for traditional Chinese medicine by the jointly owned KeWei Medical Equipment Factory.
    Smoke therapy is a method of traditional Chinese medicine for treating skin diseases. In the past, herbal medicines were wrapped in straw paper and burned to produce smoke to fumigate the affected area of the patient. The "smoked chair" is like the chairs used in dental medical departments. During treatment, the patient sits on the chair, and there is another box containing electric heating wires used to burn Chinese medicine. The medicinal smoke is led through a tube to the lower part of the chair to fumigate the patient's buttocks. The "smoked chair" also has accessories for directing smoke to fumigate various parts of the body. (Xinhua News Agency)

    熏椅
    著名中医赵炳南在北京市中医医院开始使用一台“熏椅”为病人治疗皮肤病。这是公私合营科伟医疗器械厂第一次为中医制造的医疗器械。
    熏疗是中医治疗皮肤病的一种方法，过去是用草纸卷上草药烧出烟来，熏病人的患处。“熏椅”就像牙科医疗部门用的椅子一样，治疗的时候让病人坐在椅子上，另外有一个装着电热丝的箱子，用来燃烧中药，药烟由管子引到椅子下部，熏疗患者的臀部。“熏椅”还有引烟熏疗身体各部分的附件。　（新华社）
