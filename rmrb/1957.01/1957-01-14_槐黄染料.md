    Pagoda Tree Yellow Dye
    The long-lost Pagoda Tree Yellow Dye has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private Dye Chemical Plant No. 6.
    This dye can replace imported basic light yellow dyes in dyeing cotton, wool, silk, and linen fabrics, and can also dye paper. The residue from the pagoda tree buds can also be made into excellent granular fertilizer.
    Pagoda Tree Yellow is made from the flower buds of the pagoda tree (locally called "pagoda tree buds"). China used this raw material to manufacture natural dyes in ancient times. (Xinhua News Agency)

    槐黄染料
    失传已久的槐黄染料，最近在天津市公私合营染料化学六厂试制成功。
    这种染料可以代替进口盐基淡黄来染制棉毛丝麻织品，也能染纸。槐末残渣还可以制成很好的颗粒肥料。
    槐黄是用槐树的花苞（土称槐末）制成的。我国古时就用这种原料制造天然染料。　　（新华社）
