    Hunan's Fanhang Bamboo Carving
    Li Chang'e

    Hunan's Fanhang bamboo carving is famous both at home and abroad. It doesn't use any coloring, and fully utilizes the natural color of the bamboo pith, matching it with rosewood for a harmonious color scheme. After a few years, the bamboo pith turns ivory, becoming even more beautiful.

    It uses traditional carving methods: single-knife technique, which is bold and powerful; double-knife technique, which carves smooth iron wire patterns; and even detailed relief carving, done on thin bamboo boards that are only one-third of a fen thick. It is not easy to complete without skilled and precise techniques. The carved patterns mostly feature landscapes, insects, figures, flowers, and birds that the masses are most familiar with, and decorative patterns are also used.

    This kind of bamboo carving has nearly a hundred years of history. It started with bamboo carvings with the green skin, and the products were limited to pen holders, chopsticks, etc. Later, bamboo pith products were gradually added, and items such as court bead boxes, large hanging screens, and dressing cases were made.

    From 1919, it participated in several international exhibitions and won awards.

    Since liberation, under the leadership and support of the state-owned economy, Hunan Fanhang bamboo carving has opened up sales channels, organized cooperatives, and created many new varieties, initially achieving practicality, economy, and beauty. (Attached picture)

    湖南的翻黄竹刻
    李昌鄂
    湖南的翻黄竹刻，是国内外有名的。它不设色，充分利用了竹黄的本色，和红木相配合，颜色调和。经过几年，竹黄变成了象牙色，更为美丽。
    它用传统的雕刻方法：有单刀法，粗而有力；有双刀法，刻出光滑的铁线纹；更有细致的浮雕，在三分之一分厚的薄竹板上来刻浮雕，没有熟练精巧的技术是不易完成的。雕刻的花纹，多采取群众最熟悉的山水、草虫、人物、花鸟等等，也有采用装饰图案的。
    这种竹刻已有近百年的历史。开始是带青的竹刻，产品也仅限于笔筒、筷子等，后来逐步增加竹黄产品，制成朝珠盒、大挂屏、梳妆箱等。
    1919年起参加过几次国际展览会，曾获得奖状。
    解放以来，湖南翻黄竹刻在国营经济的领导和扶植下，打开了销路，组织了合作社，创制了不少新品种，初步做到了实用、经济、美观。（附图片）
