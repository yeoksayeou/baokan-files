    Jiaxing Area's One Year of Experience Proves:
    Strengthening the Grassroots is an Effective Way to Improve Work
    Each County Must Continue to Transfer Cadres to Strengthen Township Leadership
    (Our Dispatch) Jiaxing Special District has transferred a large number of cadres to work in the rural areas. The counties have already transferred, or are in the process of transferring, district and county-level cadres to serve as full-time or part-time secretaries of the CCP general branches at the township level, totaling more than 270 people. Almost every one of the district's 280-plus townships now has a stronger Party general branch secretary. To strengthen the grassroots, the counties have also decided to transfer approximately 650 cadres to work permanently in the townships.

    After the amalgamation of districts and townships last year, the number of skilled rural workers in the area decreased by about 70%, weakening grassroots leadership. After the amalgamation of districts and townships in Wuxing County, 200 rural work cadres from the county's ten districts were transferred to work in county-level agencies, leaving only the original 400 township cadres and over 100 county-level agency cadres working in the townships. The original township cadres lacked experience in leading large townships, making it difficult to carry out work. The county felt that instructions could not be smoothly implemented, and sometimes even the current situation could not be fully grasped. Therefore, some counties set up "points" and sent cadres at the former deputy district committee secretary level to be responsible for the work at these points, followed by organizing work teams to go to the townships to assist in the work. However, some counties encountered difficulties when drawing cadres from various departments to organize work teams, with some departments reluctant to release personnel due to busy work schedules. At the same time, work teams in the townships were prone to adopting a paternalistic style and lacked long-term plans. At this point, Wuxing, Chongde, and other counties implemented a method whereby each department of the Party committee and government was responsible for guiding one or several townships; the result was that most departments either failed to play their proper role or one-sidedly emphasized departmental business work, relaxing central work and instead hindering the efforts of township cadres. Later, while county committee members went to the townships to help with work in designated areas, many counties sent over 100 county and district-level cadres to the townships to serve as general branch secretaries.

    After these 100-plus cadres with rural work experience arrived in the townships, the township work progressed more smoothly than before. After the amalgamation of townships in Maqiao Township, Jiaxing County, especially after the establishment of advanced cooperatives, the workload was heavy, and there were many new problems, and the township cadres could not figure out a solution. After the county committee sent a former district committee member to serve as general branch secretary, the collective leadership role of the general branch was brought into play, and the township's work became more proactive: the township's autumn harvest progress was faster than other townships, the grain procurement task was completed in a timely manner, and the production increase and procurement task were also overfulfilled, and the general election and conscription work were also done quickly and well. Based on these situations, the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the CPC and its subordinate county committees decided to further draw key personnel to strengthen township-level leadership. At the same time, it pointed out that the cadres sent down should fully utilize the collective leadership role of the township branches and strive to help township cadres improve their political level and work ability.

### 嘉兴地区一年的经验证明  充实基层是改进工作的有效办法  各县还要继续抽调干部加强乡的领导

    嘉兴地区一年的经验证明
    充实基层是改进工作的有效办法
    各县还要继续抽调干部加强乡的领导
    本报讯　嘉兴专区抽调大批干部深入农村工作。各县已经抽调和正在抽调到乡级基层组织去专任或兼任中共总支书记的有区级、县级干部，共二百七十余人。全区二百八十多个乡差不多每乡都有了较强的党总支书记。为了充实基层，各县还决定抽调六百五十来名干部，固定到乡工作。
    去年撤区并乡后，全区农村工作的能手约减少了70％，基层领导削弱了。吴兴县撤区并乡后，全县十个区的二百名农村工作干部上调到县级机关工作，农村只剩下原有的四百名乡干部和一百多县级机关下乡工作的干部。原来的乡干部没有领导大乡的经验，工作很难开展。县里感到指示不能顺利贯彻下去，有时连当前情况也不能全面掌握起来。于是，有些县就设立点，派原区委副书记一级的干部去负责点的工作，接着又组织工作组下乡协助工作。可是有的县从各部门抽干部组织工作组时遇到了困难，有些部门因为业务工作忙而不愿抽人。同时，工作组在乡里既易产生包办作风，又没有长期打算。这时候，吴兴、崇德等县又实行由党委和政府各部门包干指导一个至数个乡的办法；结果多数部门不是不能发挥应有作用，就是片面强调部门业务工作，放松中心工作，反而牵制了乡干部的力量。以后，许多县在县委委员下乡分片帮助工作的同时，就派了一百多名县、区级干部到乡去担任总支书记。
    这一百多名有农村工作经验的干部到乡后，乡的工作比以前顺利了。嘉兴县蚂桥乡并乡后特别是高级合作化后，工作繁重，新问题很多，乡干部理不出一个头绪来。县委派来一个原来的区委委员当总支书记后，发挥了总支集体领导的作用，乡的工作主动了：全乡的秋收进度比别乡快，粮食征购任务及时完成了，还超额完成增产增购任务，普选、征兵工作也做得又快又好。中共嘉兴地委和所属各县委根据这些情况，就决定再抽骨干加强乡级领导。同时指出：下去的干部要充分发挥乡支部集体领导作用，努力帮助乡里干部提高政治水平和工作能力。
