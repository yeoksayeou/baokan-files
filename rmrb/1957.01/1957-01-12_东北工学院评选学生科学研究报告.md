Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th. The Northeast Institute of Technology has selected twenty-five outstanding scientific research reports by students and awarded them prizes.

　　These scientific research achievements all possess considerable creativity. "Research on Electric Arc Rock Drilling" involved students analyzing various rock drilling methods, conducting experimental research for more than a year, and finally concluding the possibility of electric arc rock drilling. Research such as "Protection Against Direct Lightning Strikes" and "Secondary Crushing of Large Blocks" were all results of students addressing practical problems in on-site production, applying what they learned in courses, and studying a great deal of scientific data. Research reports such as "On the Rationality of the Anshan Blast Furnace Profile" and "The Theory and Application of Hydrocyclones" all made relatively sufficient theoretical analyses and put forward creative opinions.
