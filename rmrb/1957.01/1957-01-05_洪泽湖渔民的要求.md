    Demands of Hongze Lake Fishermen

    Since the completion of the Sanhe Sluice and the rise in the water level of Hongze Lake, the original fishing tools of the fishermen here are no longer suitable for operating in the deep water of the lake's center. Their main fishing tools are mostly baskets, weirs, traps, hooks, etc. Some of these fishing gears have a very small catch, and some are only suitable for use in shallow water. Their original boats are also relatively small, and some have not been repaired for many years, making it dangerous to go fishing in the center of the lake. However, the first problem encountered in repairing or adding these fishing boats and gear is the lack of funds in the fishery cooperatives. Adding a large fishing boat requires more than 1,000 yuan, and buying a trawl net also costs several hundred to thousands of yuan, but the public funds of the fishery cooperatives are not that much; secondly, the raw materials for some fishing gear (such as raw silk, net pieces, tung oil, and oak bark) are often out of stock and difficult to buy.

    In addition to the problems with fishing boats and gear, fishermen also lack safety guarantees in production. After the impoundment of Hongze Lake, the lake surface expanded, and there are waves even when there is no wind. However, there are few sheltered harbors around the lake, and there is a lack of storm warning stations and navigation marks on the lake. Fishermen generally hope to add storm warning stations, establish a storm warning network, and set up navigation marks.

    In addition, the fishermen's residential areas on the lake are scattered, and they hope that the grain supply departments can improve their services or add supply stations.

    The fishermen on Hongze Lake hope that their demands in production and life can be supported and assisted by relevant departments. Huangfu Yin

### 洪泽湖渔民的要求

    洪泽湖渔民的要求
    自从三河闸建成、洪泽湖的水位提高以后，这里渔民原有的捕鱼工具已不适于在湖心水深的地方操作。他们捕鱼的主要工具大部分是篮、箔、卡、钩等。这些渔具，有的取鱼量很小，有的只适合于湖浅水小的情况下应用。他们原有的船只也比较小，有些已经多年没有修理，到湖心去捕鱼是很危险的。但是，要修补或添置这些渔船和渔具，首先碰到的问题是渔业社的资金不足，添一只大渔船需要一千多元，买一具绞网也要数百以至上千元，而渔业社的公共资金是没有这么多的；其次，有些渔具的原材料（如生丝、网片、桐油、棫皮等）经常脱销，很难买到。
    除了渔船和渔具问题外，渔民在生产安全上也缺乏保障。洪泽湖蓄水以后，湖面扩大，平时无风也有浪，但是湖的周围缺少避风港湾，湖上缺少暴风警报台和航行标志。渔民们普遍希望增设暴风警报站，建立暴风警报网，和设置航行标志。
    此外，湖上渔民住区分散，希望粮食供应部门能改进业务或增设供应站。
    洪泽湖畔渔民们在生产上和生活上的这些要求，希望能够得到有关部门的支持和帮助。　　皇甫垠
