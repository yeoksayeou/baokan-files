Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 17th. Some agricultural production cooperatives in Fujian Province have made proper arrangements for current production activities in order to allow their members to have a good Spring Festival without affecting spring plowing preparations.

The members of the Xianxing Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyou County were worried about not having cash for the Spring Festival, and rushed to borrow cash from the cooperative some time ago. After studying the members' requests, the management committee of the agricultural cooperative decided to set aside seven days within the half-month period before the Spring Festival for members to engage in individual side occupations. The remaining time was allocated to a portion of the labor force to engage in sideline production for the cooperative, such as sugar extraction, while another portion of the labor force would accumulate fertilizer. In this way, by the time of the Spring Festival, members would not only earn some pocket money from their own sideline occupations, but also share more than 6,000 yuan in cash and more than 20 dan of carp from the cooperative's sugar extraction and other sideline income, without affecting the cooperative's original fertilizer accumulation plan. After this arrangement, the members' enthusiasm for production was even higher, and the daily sugar output of the sugar workshop is currently more than 100 jin higher than in the past.

The Jianguo Agricultural Cooperative in Shaxian County, based on the opinions of its members, decided that before the Spring Festival, one-third of the labor force would engage in activities such as digging up and destroying rice roots, and two-thirds of the labor force would engage in sideline production. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the cooperative decided to slaughter fifteen fat pigs, and distribute them to the members together with some of the cooperative's sideline products—fresh eggs, fresh fish, and nearly 8,000 yuan in cash. Now the members' enthusiasm for production is very high, the plan to dig up and destroy rice roots has been completed, and they have switched to winter fertilizer accumulation activities three days ahead of schedule.

    让社员欢欢喜喜过春节
    福建有些农业社作了妥善安排
    新华社福州17日电　福建省有些农业生产合作社，为了让社员过好春节，又不影响备耕工作，对当前生产活动作了妥善安排。
    仙游县仙星农业社的社员们担心没有现钱过春节，前些日子争先恐后向社里借支现金。农业社的管理委员会研究了社员的要求后，决定在春节前半个月时间内抽出七天让社员搞个人副业。其余时间决定一部分劳力从事社里的榨糖等副业生产，另一部分劳力积肥。这样，到春节时，社员们不但自己搞副业可赚些零花钱，而且还可以从社的榨糖等副业收入中分得六千多元现金和二十多担鲤鱼，同时也不影响社里原定的积肥计划。这样安排以后，社员们的生产劲头更高，目前糖坊每天的出糖量比过去增加一百多斤。
    沙县建国农业社根据社员的意见决定，在春节前以三分之一的劳力从事挖毁稻根等活动，三分之二的劳力从事副业生产。到春节前夕，社里决定宰十五头大肥猪，连同社里的一部分副业产品——鲜蛋、鲜鱼和近八千元现金一并分给社员。现在社员生产劲头很高，挖毁稻根的计划已经完成，并且提前三天转入冬季积肥活动。
