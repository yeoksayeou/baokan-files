West Germany's Unlucky Year for Conscription
        The Most Unpopular People
    In West Germany, soldiers wearing the "Bundeswehr" uniform are the most unpopular people. In a poll, 73% of people said they disliked "people in uniform." Many restaurants, bars, and hotels in various places have signs that say "No uniformed personnel allowed," supposedly to avoid damaging their reputation. Soldiers are also ostracized at carnivals and dances, and some girls refuse to dance with them. As for soldiers being ridiculed and beaten by residents, that is even more commonplace. According to a report from a German military unit, seven out of ten of its soldiers are either verbally abused or beaten. People often shout at soldiers: "Why don't you find a proper job and rely on our taxes to live?"
      Bleak Business for Conscription Registration
    Since the West German Ministry of Defense began the registration of conscription-age youth on October 15 last year, not many eligible youths have registered. Only half of the youth in West Germany's twenty-four major cities have registered, and the situation is even worse in other places. For example, in North Rhine-Westphalia, only 6.7% of eligible youth have registered for military service. In Viechtach, Bavaria, youths carried a wooden box resembling a coffin to the registration station to protest. Even in Dortmund in the Ruhr area, all the officials responsible for registration refused to work.
    To deal with this situation, the West German Ministry of Defense decided to fine those who refuse to serve up to 1,000 marks.
          No One Takes the Bait
    The Bonn Ministry of Defense once wanted to take advantage of the simplicity of young students and sent sixty-two officials to various middle schools in Bavaria to exaggerate the beauty of military life, hoping to lure these young people in. However, the result was that very few young people attended the lectures, and some lecture halls were even empty. In the end, these officials were only able to collect fifty-four children out of sixteen hundred eligible youths.
    In West Berlin, the West German authorities announced that anyone who wanted to join the army could enjoy free travel. As a result, as reported by the West German "Coburg New News," many young people used government money to travel to Hanover and Cologne, but "had not the slightest intention of joining the army."
      Western Countries Discouraged
    Many Western newspapers keen on West German rearmament have sighed with discouragement at the above situation. The American "Time" magazine once published an article saying that the year since West Germany regained its sovereignty was a "year of disappointment" for Western countries. The British "Times" also pointed out that the West German people's attitude towards military construction was "disgust, indifference, and worry"; they are seeking "political change."

    西德征兵流年不利	最不受欢迎的人
    在西德，穿着“国防军”军装的军人，是最不受欢迎的人。在一次民意测验中，有73％的人都表示不喜欢“穿军服的人”。各地许多餐厅、酒巴间和旅馆都挂着“这里不接待穿军服的人”的招牌，据说是为了避免损害名声。在游艺会和舞会上，军人也受到排斥，一些姑娘都拒绝和军人跳舞。至于军人受到居民耻笑和殴打，那更是司空见惯的事。据一支德军部队报告，它的士兵十名中有七名不是被言语侮辱就是被殴打。人们经常对军人大声喝道：“为什么你们不找一份合适的工作，要依靠我们底税收来生活呢？”
      兵役登记生意黯淡
    西德国防部去年10月15日开始兵役适龄青年登记工作以来，登记的适龄青年还是不多。西德的二十四个大城市只有一半青年进行了登记，而其他地方情况更不景气。例如，北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州已经登记服兵役的只占适龄青年的6.7％。在巴伐利亚州的维东根，青年抬着一个类似棺材的木箱到登记站，表示抗议。甚至在鲁尔区的多特蒙德，负责登记工作的全体官员都拒绝工作。
    为了对付这种情况，西德国防部决定拒绝服兵役者处以一千马克以内的罚款。
          无人上钩
    波恩国防部曾经想利用青年学生的单纯，派了六十二个官员到巴伐利亚各中学里去大事渲染当兵生活的美好，想使这些青年上钩。但是结果参加听讲的青年少得可怜，有些演讲厅甚至是空的。最后这些官员在一千六百个适龄青年中只能搜罗到五十四个孩子。
    在西柏林，西德当局宣布任何想参加军队的人都可享受免费旅行。结果如西德“科堡新报”报道的，许多年青人用了政府的钱去旅行汉诺威和科伦，但是“丝毫没有一点想当兵的意思”。
      西方国家灰心丧气
    许多热衷于西德重新武装的西方国家的报刊对上述情况发出了灰心丧气的叹息。美国“时代”周刊曾经载文说，西德恢复主权以来的一年是西方国家“失望的一年”。英国“泰晤士报”也曾经指出西德人民对建军的态度是“厌恶、冷淡和担心”；他们正在寻求“政治改变”。
