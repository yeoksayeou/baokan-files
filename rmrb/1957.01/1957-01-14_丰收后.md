　　After the Harvest
　　By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin

　　At the end of 1956, I went to Pengxing Township in Xiaogan County. One evening, I walked along a narrow village street. People on both sides of the street were busy making dou si and dou pi (pancakes made from rice and beans). A middle-aged woman with a long face picked up a knife for cutting dou si and said loudly to an old neighbor woman: "I haven't made these things for three or four years, thanks to this year's bumper harvest!" The old woman replied happily, "I haven't made dou si and dou pi for eight or nine years; if it weren't for the cooperation this year and the bumper harvest, I don't know when I would be able to afford to make them!"

　　When I arrived at the township people's committee and talked with Township Head Xiao Xingan, I learned that making dou si and dou pi was a traditional custom of the people in this area, and every household in the township was doing it. I asked Xiao Xingan, "Does making dou si and dou pi use a lot of grain? Does it affect the delivery of public grain and the sale of surplus grain?" He shook his head and said, "This year, we have a large-scale bumper harvest of grain, with an average yield of 1,013 catties and 13 taels per mu. The task of delivering public grain has been completed long ago, and the sale of surplus grain has also exceeded the task by more than double. In addition to delivering public grain, selling surplus grain, and keeping seeds, each member receives an average of 1,024 catties of grain. With increased production, life must also be improved."

　　Behind the township people's committee, in a misty bend, gongs and drums suddenly sounded. Young men and women ran towards the sound of the gongs, and several old men also widened their steps and walked over. I stopped an old man and asked, "What are they doing over there with the gongs and drums?" The old man said, "Performing a play! Comrade, come and see our cooperative's own play. It's a newly established troupe that is practicing! During the Spring Festival, seven or eight troupes in the whole township will have a grand performance!" "What kind of play are they performing?" "Hey, performing... something about the harvest..." He didn't finish his sentence and wanted to leave. Suddenly, he saw that I noticed the new gown he was wearing, and he grinned and said, "I've had two gowns like this since I can remember: the first one was made nine years ago—when I was sixty years old—but before I could wear it, I saw that my son didn't have one, so I gave it to him, and I still wore rags; this year, with the bumper harvest, this is the second one I've made."

　　It was getting dark, and the cadre meeting held in the township people's committee office had ended.晏有余, the second secretary of the Party branch, warmly invited me to chat. We squatted under the eaves. Next to us, the new houses being built caught my attention. I asked晏有余, "After this year's bumper harvest, are many houses being built?" "Many, and there are also large-scale relocations." "What is the large-scale relocation about?" He smiled softly and began to talk about the relocation. In the Huaguang Agricultural Cooperative, there was a bend with seventy-three households. The place where they lived was very low-lying, and during rainy days, there was waterlogging in front and behind the houses. Now, new houses are being built there to move the entire bend to the loess slope. I thought to myself: how much money would it cost to build houses like this! 晏有余 seemed to see my thoughts and explained, "Building the new houses doesn't cost a penny. The bricks are made in the fields, the wood is dismantled from the old houses, and the nails? People don't have to pay for them themselves. We used the threshing ground to plant late rice in advance, and now we have harvested more than 4,000 catties of rice, which is enough to buy nails." He paused and added, "This large-scale relocation has many benefits. Just demolishing the houses of one production team (twenty-two households) will provide enough old wall soil to fertilize 550 mu of land; demolishing the old wall soil of the entire bend of houses, how much land will it fertilize! After the houses are demolished, a reservoir will be built here to expand the irrigation area and strive for a bumper harvest next year."

　　He lit a cigarette, took a puff, and then excitedly talked about the relocation of a production team in the Wuhong Agricultural Cooperative: they had eighteen households, living alone in a small bend surrounded by water, but their fields were close to the big bend. They had wanted to move earlier, but they were afraid that the people in the big bend would bully them. Now, for the convenience of production and labor allocation, the cooperative educated the people in the big bend not to discriminate against them and to help them move to the big bend. Their new houses will be built before the Spring Festival.

　　晏有余 talked until very late before going back. He knew that I wanted to visit their key cooperative (Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative), and the next day, he enthusiastically ran over to invite me to go with him. The weather was gloomy, and the cold wind whistled in the fields. We wanted to speed up our pace, but groups of people carrying grain blocked the road. I asked晏有余, where are these people carrying the grain to? He said that this was the grain distributed to the members by the cooperative, and they couldn't finish eating it, so they were carrying it to the grain purchasing station for sale. He carefully examined the people carrying the grain and said, "Most of them are from Changfeng Cooperative. They harvested a lot of grain this year, 72% more than last year, surpassing even the best rich peasants!"

　　When I arrived at Changfeng Cooperative, I inquired about their production surpassing the rich peasants. Cooperative Director Guan Musheng said: Guan Denghua is one example. His family had strong labor, fertile land, and good and complete farming tools and cattle, and was the best rich peasant in the entire bend. After the storm of cooperation swept him into the agricultural cooperative, he always said that no matter how much the agricultural cooperative increased production, it would not exceed his income from working individually. Some members also felt that his words made some sense. However, after the distribution and final accounting, his family of three had an income of nearly 6,000 catties of grain, an increase of more than 1,600 catties compared to 1955. He was extremely happy. He said to everyone he met, "I admire the agricultural cooperative from the bottom of my heart." Every morning, he automatically got up to pick up manure and make straw ropes, unlike before when the team leader had to call him to work.

　　After listening to Guan Musheng's words, I was reminded of the situation where the bumper harvest of 1956 educated the individual farmers, as mentioned by some production team leaders. It was at a distribution and final accounting meeting where six individual farmers were invited to attend the meeting. They listened attentively to people talking about the income situation of the members. Rich peasant Zhao Lianchuan heard that the cooperative member Zhao Guifang and his daughter, with two laborers, had a total income of more than 500 yuan for the whole year; thinking that his family of five full laborers had only an income of more than 300 yuan, he felt very sad. He glared at Zhao Yunguan (an old rich peasant) and said angrily, "It's all because you swore that whoever joins the cooperative first is a son of a bitch; if it weren't for that, I would have joined the cooperative in the spring, and with five full laborers working until now, wouldn't I have an income of 700 or 800 yuan?" He demanded to join the cooperative on the spot. Rich peasant Chen Xuechun also complained to Zhao Yunguan, saying, "Listening to your words is like following a ghost! Fortunately, the cooperative took care of my production and lent me more than 1,000 catties of commercial fertilizer; but even so, after calculating the accounts now, my income is still reduced by half compared to the average member. Right now, I want to join the cooperative, but I can't even afford the seeds." He asked the cooperative to forgive him for this difficulty and allow him to join the cooperative. Zhao Yunguan covered his head with his hands for a long time without saying a word; the next day, he and several individual farmers requested to join the cooperative.

　　In the Eighth Production Team, people were talking about: not long ago, Luo Ensheng and his wife often quarreled and wanted to get a divorce because of living problems. After the bumper harvest, their income increased several times, and the couple became talkative and smiling. They went to the supply and marketing cooperative every day to participate in the work of processing and cutting leather straps.

　　The family of cooperative member Guan Daosheng was very grateful to the cadres for caring about their lives. After the bumper harvest, they were a bit wasteful and spent their surplus grain, and were about to use their rations. The cadres educated them to be frugal and helped them arrange their family life. Now their lives are going very well. This matter educated the members, and the atmosphere of "never forgetting thrift after the harvest" is growing.

　　The Spring Festival is coming soon. I asked the members how this year's Spring Festival compares to last year. They said with joy, much better than last year: Last year, people wanted grain coupons and not cloth coupons, and they couldn't use up the one catty of meat coupons issued per person during the Spring Festival; this year, people want cloth coupons and not grain coupons, and ordinary families want to buy ten or twenty catties of pork for the Spring Festival, and even the poorer families want to buy two catties of meat per person. In addition, each household wants to buy fish and lotus roots worth eight or nine yuan for the Spring Festival. (These non-staple foods are all produced by the cooperative itself, and the members pre-ordered them from the cooperative during the distribution and final accounting.)

　　Encouraged by the bumper harvest, the members actively invested in winter production. The stubble of more than 1,800 mu of fields has been cleaned up; the teams have accumulated a large amount of natural fertilizer; more than ten kinds of sideline production such as raising pigs, raising poultry, ginning cotton, and making flour have been started. Here and there, people are building ponds and weirs, and the song of "repairing water conservancy and celebrating the Spring Festival" resounds throughout the fields.

    丰收后
    本报记者　古维进
    1956年年底，我到了孝感县的朋兴乡。傍晚，我沿着一条狭长的村街走过。两旁人家都在忙着做豆丝、豆皮（大米和豆子制成的煎饼）。一个长脸的中年妇女拿起切豆丝的刀子高声地对一个邻居的老太婆说：“三四年没做过这些东西了，多亏今年大丰收！”老太婆乐呵呵地答道：“我呀，八九年没做过豆丝、豆皮了；要不是今年合作化，大丰收，还不知哪年才做得起呢！”
    到了乡人民委员会，和乡长萧新官谈起来，才知道做豆丝、豆皮是这一带群众的传统习惯，全乡家家户户都在做呢。我问萧新官：“做豆丝、豆皮费粮食吧？不影响交公粮和售余粮吗？”他摇摇头说：“今年粮食大面积丰收，平均一亩产一千零十三斤十三两。公粮任务早就完成了，售余粮也超过任务一倍多。除了交公粮、售余粮、留种子外，平均每个社员分到粮食一千零二十四斤。生产提高了，生活也得改善改善。”
    在乡人民委员会后面，一片雾气模糊的弯子里，忽然锣鼓咚咚响。青年男女顺着锣声跑过去，几个老汉也放宽步子走。我截住一个老汉问：“那边敲锣打鼓干什么？”老汉说：“唱戏！同志，看看我们社里自己的戏吧，才兴起的剧团，在练习唱呢！到春节，全乡七八个剧团要大会演呢！”“唱的什么戏？”“嘿，唱……丰收什么的……”他话没说完，想开腿了。忽然见我注意他身上穿的新袍子，咧开嘴巴笑着说：“这种袍子，从我记事的时候起，做过两件：头一件是九年前——六十岁那年——做的，还没穿上身，看见儿子没得，给了他穿，自己还是穿破袍；今年丰收了，这是做的第二件。”
    天渐渐黑了，乡人民委员会办公室举行的干部接头会议已经结束。党支部第二书记晏有余热情地邀我聊天。我们蹲在屋檐下。旁边，正在修建的新房子引起我的注意。我问晏有余说：“今年丰收之后，修建房子的很多吧？”“多啦，还有大搬家的呢。”“大搬家是怎么回事？”他轻轻地笑了笑，说起搬家的事来。华光农业社有一个弯子有七十三户，住的地方地势非常低，下雨天，屋前屋后都是渍水。现在在那里修建新房子，要把整个弯子搬上黄土坡。我心里想：这样一来，得花多少钱修房子呢！晏有余好像看出我的心思，解释说：“修建新房子，不花一个钱。砖是自己在田里打的，木料是从旧房拆下来的，钉子呢？也不用大家自己掏钱。事前利用打谷场种晚稻，现在收了四千多斤谷，足够买钉子了。”他顿了顿，又说：“这次大搬家好处多着哩。才拆了一个生产队（二十二户）的房子，那陈墙土就可以肥五百五十亩田；把整个弯子的房子的陈墙土拆下来，该肥多少田啊！拆掉房子以后，这里就要修建一个水库，扩大灌溉面积，争取明年大丰收。”
    他点了烟，抽了一口，又兴致勃勃地说到五红农业社一个生产队搬家的事情：他们有十八户，孤零零地住在一个被水包围的小弯子里，田地却靠近大弯子。早先有心搬家，害怕大弯子的人欺侮。现在，合作社为了生产调配劳动力的便利，教育大弯子的人不要歧视他们，帮助他们搬到大弯子去。春节以前，他们的新房子就可以盖起来了。
    晏有余谈到很晚才回去。他知道我想到他们的重点社（长风农业社）去访问，第二天，就热情地跑来邀我一同走。天气阴晦，冷风在田野里吹得呜呜的响。我们想加快步子，可是，挑谷的人成群结队的把路拦住。我问晏有余，这些人把谷挑到哪里去？他说这是社里分给社员的谷，他们吃不完，挑到粮食收购站去出售。他仔细打量了挑谷的人，又说：“多半是长风社的。他们今年打的粮食多呢，比去年增产72％，把最好的富裕中农也赛过了！”
    到了长风社，我打听了他们的生产赛过富裕中农的情形。社主任官木生说：官登华就是一个例子。他家的劳力很强，土地肥沃，耕牛农具又好又齐全，是全弯子最棒的富裕中农。合作化的风暴把他卷进农业社以后，他总是说，不管农业社怎样增产，超不过他单干的收入。有些社员也觉得他的话有几分道理。可是，分配决算之后，他家三口人，收入粮食将近六千斤，比1955年增产一千六百多斤。他高兴极了。逢人便说“从心底里佩服农业社”。每天一早，他自动起来捡粪，打草绳，不像以前要组长叫唤才出工。
    听了官木生的话，我联想到一些生产队长谈到1956年丰收教育了单干农民的情形。那是在一个分配决算会议上，有六户单干农民被邀请列席了会议。他们聚精会神地听人谈着社员的收入情形。富裕中农赵连传听到社员赵贵方父女两个劳动力全年收入五百多元；想想自己家五个全劳力才收入三百多元，心里非常难过。他瞪了赵运官（老富裕中农）一眼，气鼓鼓地说：“都是你当初赌咒，说谁先入社谁是儿；要不是这样，我春上入了社，五个全劳动力做到现在，还不收入七八百元？”他当场要求入社。富裕中农陈学春也埋怨赵运官说：“听了你的话算是跟上鬼！多亏社里对我的生产还算是照顾，借给一千多斤商品肥料；可就是这样，现在把账一算，还比一般社员减少了一半收入。眼下想入社连种子都带不起。”他请求社里原谅他这个困难，允许入社。赵运官用手蒙着脑袋半天不说话；第二天，他和几户单干农民要求入社了。
    在第八生产队里，人们在谈着：不久以前，罗恩生夫妇因为生活问题经常吵架闹离婚。丰收以后，收入增加几倍，两口子变得有说有笑了，每天一块儿上供销社参加加工割皮条的工作。
    社员官道胜一家人，非常感激干部关心他们的生活。丰收以后，他们有点浪费，把余粮花掉了，就要动用口粮。干部教育他们节约，帮助他们安排家庭生活，现在他们的日子过得很好了。这件事情教育了社员，“丰收不忘勤俭”的风气正在成长。
    春节快到了，我问社员今年过春节比去年怎样？他们喜笑颜开地说，比去年强得多了：去年，人们要粮票不要布票，春节每人发一斤肉票用不完；今年呢，人们要布票不要粮票，一般人家都要买一、二十斤猪肉过春节，比较差的家庭，每人也要买二斤肉。此外，平均每户过春节要买值八九块钱的鱼和藕。（这些副食品都是社里自己生产的，社员在分配决算的时候就向社里预定好了。）
    在丰收的鼓舞下，广大社员积极地投入冬季生产。有一千八百多亩田的谷蔸已经捡干净；各队积蓄了大量自然肥料；养猪、养家禽、轧花、做粉等十多种副业生产都搞起来了。这里那里，人们都在兴修塘堰，“修好水利过春节”的歌声响遍原野。
