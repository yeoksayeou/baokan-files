　　Speidel's "Responsibilities"
　　Five years ago, when the French National Assembly was discussing the rearmament of West Germany within the Western European Union, a disabled veteran deputy, Mr. Schuler, stood up from his seat and shouted, "I am not willing for my son to stand side by side with the butchers." Mr. Schuler's cry expressed the general sentiment of French patriots.
　　However, it seems that the politicians of the French ruling group have a different sentiment. They have been colluding with the Nazi butchers, talking about "cooperation" and "friendship." Not long ago, they even recommended Speidel, one of the former Nazi invasion army chiefs, to replace French General Guillaume as the commander-in-chief of the Central European ground forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In this way, French youth not only have to stand side by side with the butchers who slaughtered their relatives, but also have to obey these butchers.
　　Speaking of Speidel, ordinary French people find it difficult to suppress the flames of hatred in their hearts. At the beginning of World War II, it was he who led Hitler's army into France. In 1940, when the representatives of the French Pétain traitorous government went to the Hitler German headquarters train in the Compiègne Forest to surrender, it was this Speidel who signed the surrender document on behalf of Hitler's Germany. It was the Nazi army under his command that disregarded international law during the occupation of France, massacred large numbers of innocent French men, women, and children in various places, and escorted tens of thousands of detained French patriots and peaceful residents to the East. Such a criminal, whose hands were stained with the blood of the French people, was appreciated by Washington and the West German ruling group after the war because of his active activities in rearming West Germany, and served as the Chief of Staff of West Germany, and represented the Bonn government at the meetings of the "Western European Union" and the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization." After the news that he would be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Central European ground forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization came out, the American "Newsweek" immediately expressed satisfaction, calling him "one of America's best friends in West Germany."
　　The French ruling group's decision to place Speidel in an important position in the North Atlantic military group naturally catered to the wishes of the boss across the Atlantic. However, when they are so obedient, the French people remember what West German former Defense Minister Blank said about the role of the future West German army. He once advocated that if the future West German army is not sufficient to undertake the anti-Soviet mission that the planners of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization intend to entrust to it, "it will at least be able to fulfill its responsibilities in France." At a time when the butcher who slaughtered countless peaceful French residents swaggered into the Fontainebleau headquarters, this is a very pertinent question: What "responsibilities" will the new West German defense force under the command of this commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "fulfill" in France?

### 斯派达尔的“职责”

    斯派达尔的“职责”
    五年前，当法国国民议会在讨论重新武装西德的西欧联盟时，一位残废军人议员修勒德从席位上站起来大声疾呼：“我决不愿意我的儿子同屠夫们并肩站在一起。”修勒德这种呼声表达出了法国爱国人士的普遍情绪。
    可是，看来法国统治集团的政客们却有着另外一种情绪，他们一直在同纳粹屠夫们勾勾搭搭，大谈其“合作”和“友谊”。不久前，他们还把前纳粹侵略军首脑之一斯派达尔推荐为北大西洋公约组织中欧地面部队总司令，来代替法国的纪尧姆将军。这样一来，法国的青年不但得同屠杀过他们的亲人的屠夫们并肩站在一起，而且还得听命于这些屠夫。
    提起斯派达尔，法国的普通人很难抑制住心头仇恨的火焰。第二次世界大战开始时，就是他率领希特勒军队攻进了法国。在1940年法国贝当卖国政府代表到康比埃尼森林希特勒德军司令部列车上投降的时候，代表希特勒德国在受降书上签字的也正是这个斯派达尔。是他指挥下的纳粹军队，在占领法国期间，无视国际法规，在各地大量屠杀了无辜的法国老幼妇孺，并且把成千上万被拘的法国爱国志士和和平居民押送到东方。这样一个双手沾满了法国人民鲜血的罪犯，在战后却因为他对重新武装西德的积极活动而受到了华盛顿和西德统治集团的欣赏，由是担任了西德的参谋总长，并且代表波恩政府出席“西欧联盟”和“北大西洋公约组织”的会议。在他将被任命为北大西洋公约组织中欧地面部队总司令的消息传出以后，美国“新闻周刊”立即表示满意，称他是“美国在西德最好的朋友之一”。
    法国统治集团把斯派达尔接上北大西洋军事集团的重要位置，这当然迎合了大西洋彼岸老板的心意。但是，当他们这样唯命是从的时候，法国人民却记得西德前国防部长布兰克关于未来西德军队的作用说过的一句话。他曾鼓吹说，将来西德军队如果不足以担当北大西洋公约策划人打算交给它的反苏任务，“它至少有能力在法国方面克尽它的职责”。在残杀过无数法国和平居民的屠夫大模大样地走进枫丹白露总部的时候，这是一个非常合乎时宜的问题：北大西洋公约这位司令指挥下的西德新国防军将会在法国“克尽”什么“职责”呢？
