    It's certainly not me speaking with hindsight, we were just about to propose to the publishing house the publication of Gao Lan's recitation poems, and unexpectedly this collection of poems has already appeared before us, which is truly gratifying. Why did we suddenly think of making this suggestion in the first place? It's because Gao Lan's recitation poems have long been loved and familiar to us. Take "Crying for My Deceased Daughter Sophie" for example, I remember that at the time (for a period after the poem was published), there were very few students living in Chongqing who didn't know it. We read it, recited it, and copied it. We loved its delicate, sincere, and profound emotions; we liked its fluent, beautiful, and natural language; we were deeply moved by it many times during recitation, and couldn't help but weep sadly, crying with the author. That's why we still remember it after more than a decade.

    However, what is greatly surprising is that the author specifically stated in the postscript of the collection: "Certain works, which in today's view have aspects that may not be entirely appropriate, indeed caused me to repeatedly consider and hesitate, for example, the poem 'Crying for My Deceased Daughter Sophie,' which was only finally decided to be included at the very moment of printing." He then explained the meaning of this poem, and finally quoted Comrade Lu Dingyi's words as a theoretical basis, as if deeply afraid of not passing muster. I and several comrades reread the entire book, and unanimously believed that, artistically, "Crying for My Deceased Daughter Sophie" can be considered the most mature and perfect of the eighteen poems. As for whether the poem still has practical significance today, our opinion is also affirmative. As for the "aspects that may not be entirely appropriate," limited by our level, we have indeed not found any. So, we can't help but ask: what exactly made Mr. Gao Lan "repeatedly consider and hesitate"? Is it because its content is a father crying for his deceased daughter, which may be criticized as carrying the petty-bourgeois sentimentality of personal sorrow? Or is it because in the new society, there is no longer any need for those so-called weeping and wailing things of the past? If that is really the case, then please allow me to ask: what practical significance do we have in reading "Blessing" and "Kong Yiji" today?

    Finally, I would also like to make a suggestion: I hope that relevant departments can re-edit and publish some excellent and progressive works that were diligently created by some poets in the old society who were not very well known in the past. I think this work has the same important significance as re-copying and showing progressive films of the past. Of course, to achieve these goals, what must first be broken is the dogmatic criticism that creates the author's "concerns," and the vulgar sociological trend that was quite popular not long ago.

    高兰先生的顾虑
    杨大矛
    决不是我在这里放马后炮，我们正准备向出版社提议出版高兰的朗诵诗，想不到这本诗集已出现在我们面前，这的确使人高兴。我们原先为什么会突然想起提这个建议呢？这是因为高兰的朗诵诗早已为我们所热爱、所熟悉。就拿“哭亡女苏菲”来说吧，我记得当时（诗问世后的一段时间）生活在重庆的学生，确实是很少有人不知道的。我们阅读它，朗诵它，传抄它。我们爱它那细腻、真挚、深沉的感情；我们喜欢它那流畅、优美、自然的语言；我们曾多少次在朗诵中为它深深感动，禁不住凄然下泪，与作者同声一哭。这就是为什么在十数年之后我们还念念不忘它。
    但是，使人大为惊讶的是，作者在诗集的后记中竟特意声明：有“某些作品，在今天看来已有未必合适之处，确使我反复考虑犹豫不决，例如‘哭亡女苏菲’一诗，就是在付印之顷，才终于决定选入的。”紧接着又把这首诗的意义解释了一番，最后还引用了陆定一同志的话来作理论根据，好像深怕通不过似的。我和几位同志又重读了全本，一致认为在十八首诗中，在艺术上“哭亡女苏菲”可以算是最成熟、最完美的。至于诗在今天是否仍有现实意义，我们的意见也是肯定的。至于“未必合适”之处，限于水平，我们的确没有找出。那么，我们不禁要问：到底是什么使高兰先生“反复考虑犹豫不决”呢？难道是因为它的内容是父亲哭亡女，可能被指为带有小资产阶级的个人感伤的情调呢？还是因为在新社会再也用不着过去那些所谓哭哭啼啼的东西呢？如果真是这样的话，那么请容我问一声：我们今天读“祝福”、“孔乙己”又有什么现实意义呢？
    最后，我还想提一点建议：希望有关部门能把过去一些不甚为人所熟知的诗人在旧社会所辛勤创作的一些优秀的、进步的作品重新编选出版，我觉得这一工作和重新拷贝、上映过去的进步影片是具有同等重要的意义。当然，要做到这些，首先必须打破的，是造成作者“顾虑”的那些教条主义的批评，和不久以前颇为流行的庸俗社会学的风气。
