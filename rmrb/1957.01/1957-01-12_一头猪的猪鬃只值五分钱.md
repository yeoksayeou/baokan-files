    A Pig's Bristles Are Only Worth Five Cents
    In some areas of Jiangxi Province, pig bristles are too cheap; the purchase price for the bristles of one pig is only five cents. As everyone knows, pig bristles are one of the materials that our country needs for both export and domestic sales. Because the operating departments have reduced the price to such an unreasonable level, pig slaughterers are no longer interested in pulling bristles, and many pig bristles are simply lost with the pig hair in the dirty water. This practice is not only unfavorable to the people, but also a great loss to the country. Yang Sheng

    一头猪的猪鬃只值五分钱
    江西省有些地方的猪鬃太贱了，一头猪的猪鬃收购价仅仅是五分钱。大家知道，猪鬃是我们国家出口和内销都很需要的物资之一。由于经营部门把价格压低得太不像话了，使现在宰猪户对拔鬃已没有了兴趣，很多猪鬃就这样白白地随着猪毛流失在脏水里。这种做法，不仅对人民群众不利，同时对国家也是一种莫大的损失。　杨生
