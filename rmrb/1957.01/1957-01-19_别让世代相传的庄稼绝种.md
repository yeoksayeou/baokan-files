At the symposium of old farmers held in Xunwang District, Guiping County, and Xinqiao District, Yulin County, Guangxi, the old farmers reflected a noteworthy problem: Most agricultural cooperatives plant very little of some of the miscellaneous grain that the people love, or do not plant it at all. Now the precious crop seeds passed down by farmers for generations have been greatly reduced or have died out. For example, glutinous rice. Many agricultural cooperatives think that its output is not high and it is troublesome to store, so they have greatly reduced its planting area. When the autumn harvest came last year, each cooperative member household only received ten catties, and there was nothing left to sell to the state. Another example is black glutinous rice, which farmers regard as a precious and nutritious tonic. In the past, individual farmers would plant a little, but now many cooperatives do not plant even a single grain. In addition, many cooperatives do not plant black beans, rice beans, or mung beans. The farmers are worried that they will not be able to eat glutinous rice dumplings and mung bean soup in the future!

The existing crop varieties have also been significantly reduced. Taking rice as an example, before cooperativization, there were twenty or thirty varieties in a township; now, a cooperative has seven or eight varieties at most, and only four or five at least; some varieties that have been passed down for many years and are suitable for local planting are no longer planted.

Agricultural production cooperatives have changed some backward technologies in agricultural production and promoted increased production, which is welcomed by farmers. However, at the same time, we must also be careful not to discard some useful things passed down by farmers for generations (including some small miscellaneous grains and local fine varieties that are loved and needed by urban and rural people) along with the backward things. Now agricultural cooperatives are discussing and formulating this year's production plans. Has everyone paid attention to the issue of appropriately retaining local fine varieties and rationally arranging the planting area of small miscellaneous grains?

### 别让世代相传的庄稼绝种

    别让世代相传的庄稼绝种
    在广西桂平县寻旺区、玉林县新桥区召开的老农座谈会上，老农们反映了一个值得注意的问题：多数农业社对于人民热爱的某些杂粮种的很少，或者根本不种，现在农民世代相传的珍贵的作物种子大大减少或者绝种了。例如糯谷，很多农业社嫌它产量不高，收藏麻烦，因此大大压缩了它的种植面积。去年秋收的时候，每户社员只能分到十斤，此外就一点没有卖给国家的了。又如黑糯，农民把它看做是一种名贵的富有营养的补品。过去，个体农民多少要种一点，可是，许多合作社一粒也不种了。此外，像黑豆、饭豆、绿豆，很多合作社也都没有种。农民们都担心以后吃不上糯米粽子和绿豆沙了！
    现有的作物的品种也显著减少了。拿水稻来说，在合作化以前，一个乡里就有二、三十个品种；现在一个社里多的有七、八个品种，少的只有四、五个品种；有些多年传下来的适合当地种植的品种也不种了。
    农业生产合作社改变了农业生产中某些落后的技术，促进了增产，这是农民所欢迎的。但是，同时也要留心，不要把农民世代相传的一些有用的东西（包括城乡人民所喜爱和需要的一些小杂粮和地方良种在内）连同落后的东西一块抛弃了。现在农业社都在讨论制订今年的生产计划，大家是不是已经留意到适当保留地方良种和合理安排小杂粮的种植面积这个问题了呢？
