    Manage Winter Wheat Fields Well
    By a commentator from this newspaper
    Last year, China harvested over 40 billion jin of winter wheat, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total grain output. Last autumn, across the country, 370 million mu of winter wheat were sown, a bit more than the autumn before. Doing a good job in field management of winter wheat during the winter and spring seasons is indeed of great significance for completing this year's grain production increase task.
    Preventing frost damage and increasing topdressing are two important ways to ensure winter wheat overwinter smoothly. Last autumn, many areas had insufficient rainfall, and winter wheat was planted with difficulty. Due to insufficient fertilizer, some wheat fields were not applied with base fertilizer. Some areas affected by floods were forced to postpone the sowing period because the water receded too late. Since last autumn, some winter wheat producing areas have lacked rain and snow; in many areas, the area of winter watering has also decreased. This spring, these areas are very likely to experience drought in the wheat fields. Therefore, from now on, we should do a good job in topdressing, frost prevention, and drought prevention and moisture conservation. Harrowing wheat in early spring and implementing spring irrigation are effective measures for drought prevention and moisture conservation, and we should prepare water lifting tools and arrange manpower and animal power as soon as possible.
    Last year, many areas suffered from floods, and these areas planted more winter wheat than usual. Winter wheat will be harvested during the period when the old crop is gone and the new crop hasn't come in, which is of great importance for shortening the disaster period and supporting this year's summer and autumn agricultural production. Agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas should make proper arrangements according to the needs of both agriculture and sideline occupations, and do both agriculture and sideline occupations well. An old farmer in a disaster area in Hebei said well: Earning money from sideline occupations can exchange for corn buns right now; managing the wheat fields well can allow us to eat steamed buns next year. We should take care of these two productions at the same time, and we cannot grab corn buns and lose steamed buns!
    Last year, both the South and the North saw large-scale high-yield records of more than 10,000 mu and high-yield records of more than 1,000 jin per mu. An important reason for the emergence of these high-yield records is that these areas have generally improved and enhanced the cultivation techniques of wheat. Strengthening the field management of winter wheat during the winter and spring seasons is a major part of improving cultivation techniques. If we put in more effort in winter and spring management of wheat fields, the high-yield area of wheat will expand this year, and the yield per unit area will increase.

    把冬小麦田管理好
    本报评论员
    我国去年收获冬小麦四百多亿斤，占粮食总产量的十分之一以上。去年秋季，全国各地播种的冬小麦有三亿七千万亩，比前年秋季播种的要多一些。作好小麦的冬春两季的田间管理工作，对于完成今年的粮食增产任务，确实有重大的意义。
    防御冻害，增施追肥，是保证冬麦顺利越冬的两个重要办法。去年秋季，许多地区雨水不足，冬麦是勉强种下地的。由于肥料不够，有的麦田没有施用基肥。有些遭受水灾地区，因为积水退的过晚，被迫推迟了播种期。有些冬麦产区，自去秋以来雨雪缺少；不少地区冬季浇麦的面积又减少了。今年春季，这些地区的麦田很有发生旱象的可能。因此，从现在起，就应该作好追肥、防冻和防旱保墒工作。早春耙麦、实行春灌是防旱保墒的有效措施，应该及早准备提水工具，安排人力、畜力。
    去年许多地区遭受水灾，这些地区播种了比往常要多的冬小麦。冬小麦将在青黄不接的时候收获，这对缩短灾期、支援今年夏秋的农业生产，具有重要的作用。灾区的农业社应该按着兼顾农业和副业的需要，作一个妥善的安排，把农业和副业同时作好。河北灾区一个老农说的好：搞副业赚钱，眼下可以换窝窝；把麦田管理好，明年可以吃馍馍。我们应该同时照顾这两项生产，不能抓住窝窝而丢了馍馍！
    无论南方、北方，去年都出现了万亩以上的大面积丰产纪录和亩产千斤以上的高额丰产纪录。出现这些丰产纪录的一个重要原因，是这些地区普遍地改进和提高了小麦的栽培技术。加强冬麦的冬春两季的田间管理，就是改进栽培技术的一个主要部分。如果我们在麦田冬春管理上加一把劲，今年小麦的丰产面积还会扩大，单位面积产量还会提高。
