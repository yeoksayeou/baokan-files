    Don't Confuse "Creation" with "Organization"
    In the article by Qin Jun'guang introducing the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture on page 4 of the People's Daily on November 25, 1956, it was written: "In the long years, the Bai people have created a rich and colorful folk literature. The famous love story poem 'Looking-Husband Cloud' tells the story of the Nanzhao period..." I think this statement seems too general. As far as I know, "Looking-Husband Cloud" is only one of the oral legends of the Bai people (in the Dali County Chronicle and other unofficial histories, there are a few short written records). It has never been preserved in the form of a poem. Whether it is the "Looking-Husband Cloud" poems written by Xu Jiarui, Xu Chi, Lu Ning, or myself, they can only be regarded as personal creations based on folk tales.
    Similarly, in Yang Zhengwang's article "Pay Attention to Collecting Folk Literature and Art Creations of Ethnic Minorities" in the "National Life" section of the Guangming Daily on November 23, 1956, Wei Qilin's long poem "Hundred Bird Dress," created based on Zhuang folk tales, was also mistakenly referred to as a "Zhuang folk long poem" and "excavated and introduced." This shows that in the minds of some comrades, the two different concepts of "creation" and "organization" are confused.　(Gōng Liú)

    不要把“创作”和“整理”混为一谈
    1956年11月25日人民日报第四版上，秦军光介绍大理白族自治州的文章中写道：“在悠久的岁月中，白族人民创造了丰富多采的民间文学，有名的爱情故事诗‘望夫云’，说的就是南诏时的故事……”。我以为，这一说法似嫌笼统。据我所知，“望夫云”仅仅是白族人民的口头传说之一（在大理县志稿及其他野史中，有少数几则简短的文字记载），它从来就不是以诗的形式保存下来的。不论徐嘉瑞、徐迟、鲁凝和我写的“望夫云”诗篇，都只能算作是取材于民间故事的个人创作。
    同样的，1956年11月23日光明日报“民族生活”版中，杨正旺的文章“注意搜集少数民族的民间文艺创作”中，也错把韦其麟根据僮族民间故事创作的长诗“百鸟衣”说成是“僮族的民间长诗”，并且是“被发掘、介绍出来”的。这说明了在某些同志的心目中，“创作”和“整理”这两个不同的概念是混淆不清的。　（公刘）
