The Horqin Right Wing Rear Banner in Heilongjiang Province, in order to protect livestock and ensure they safely survive the winter, launched a mass "Love and Protect Livestock Campaign Month" from December 10th of last year to January 10th of this year. At the start of the campaign, some townships held forums with commune directors, livestock committee members, breeders, herders, and transporters to establish reward and punishment systems. They also initiated red flag competitions between teams within communes and among breeders. Some communes replaced unqualified breeders and herders. For better management, some communes divided large herds into smaller groups, allocated grazing areas, and assigned dedicated personnel for herding and feeding. They also established mass inspection systems with specific personnel responsible for checking horse pens and the condition of the horses. The Taiyangsheng Commune implemented "Love Horse Days" on windy and snowy days, exercising the horses and cleaning the pens, and held a condition comparison meeting every fifteen days. To stimulate everyone's care for old, weak, thin, and sick horses, some communes adopted the method of hanging "vacation tags" on the horses' ears. The Xingfu Commune also proposed competitive conditions to fraternal communes throughout the county for protecting pregnant livestock: to ensure that pregnant livestock do not abort and young livestock do not die, horses five to six months into pregnancy should not be ridden, used to pull carts, fed frost-covered grass, given cold water to drink, or startled by cold whips. As of now, 75% of the county's horses have been brought into sheds (horse sheds were previously rare in the Northeast). More than 60% of the original two thousand seven hundred and eighty-plus thin and weak horses that could not get up have recovered their health, and the general condition of the horses has improved by 10%. Recently, the Horqin Right Wing Rear Banner Committee instructed all townships to extend the "Love and Protect Livestock Campaign" for another two weeks to ensure that all horses in the county are brought into sheds.

    郭尔罗斯后旗举行爱畜保畜运动月
    群众创造了许多保护牲畜的好办法
    黑龙江省郭尔罗斯后旗为保护牲畜安全过冬，从去年12月10日至今年1月10日，开展了群众性的“爱畜保畜运动月”。运动一开始，有些乡召开了社主任、畜牧委员、饲养员、放牧员、运输员座谈会，订立了奖惩制度，并开展了以社为单位的队与队、饲养员之间的流动红旗竞赛。有的社调换了不称职的饲养员、放牧员。为了更好的管理，有的社将大群分成小群，划分草源，固定专人放牧、喂养，并建立了群众性的检查制度，有专人负责检查马圈和马膘。太阳升社实行了风、雪天为“爱马日”，蹓马、打扫圈，每十五天并召开一次比膘会。为了激发大家对老、弱、瘦、病的马匹的爱护，有的社采取了在马耳上挂“休假牌”的办法。幸福社并向全县各兄弟社提出爱护孕畜的竞赛条件：为保证孕畜不流产，幼畜不死亡，怀驹五至六月的马，不骑、不驾辕、不吃霜草、不饮冷水、不打冷鞭子惊马等。截至目前为止，全县75％的马匹已进了棚（过去东北极少有马棚）。原二千七百八十多匹爬不起来的瘦、弱的马，已有60％多恢复健康，马膘普遍提高一成。最近郭尔罗斯后旗委又指示各乡，将“爱畜保畜运动”再延续两周，做到全县马匹全部进棚。
