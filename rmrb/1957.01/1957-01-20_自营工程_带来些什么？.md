What do "Self-Managed Projects" Bring?
By our reporter Kang Weizhong

In Harbin, many government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and schools have been constructing office buildings, small factories, or dormitories in the past half-year. Some of them even registered with the state construction administration department and completed the procedures at the beginning of construction. However, many more did not inform anyone and simply transferred cadres within their units, hired workers from society, and grabbed materials from the market to start building. If the Basic Construction Office of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee and the Harbin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau had not conducted an inspection recently, this "unmanaged free market" in basic construction would have continued to spread unchecked! According to the inspection, there are 168 such construction units in Harbin, with a construction area of 300,000 square meters in the second half of 1956 alone. Similar situations exist in other cities in Heilongjiang Province. Because these projects are operated, managed, independently accounted for, and responsible for their own profits and losses by the units themselves, they are called "self-managed projects."

There is no doubt that the construction units are subjectively trying their best to build "self-managed projects" well. However, because "self-managed projects" are not included in the national plan, they often fail to be completed and cause incalculable losses to the country.

Taking the recruitment of workers as an example, the losses brought to the country by "self-managed projects" are considerable. Originally, the labor force for key projects in Harbin was already insufficient, and there were very few scattered construction workers in the city. To complete their tasks, the "self-managed project" units competed to recruit workers. Most of the units recruiting workers in the city adopted the form of "small contracting," that is, through so-called "worker representatives," they negotiated prices and then the "worker representatives" privately recruited workers everywhere, even from the construction sites of key projects. This "small contracting" not only resulted in exploitation by foremen but also endlessly increased wage levels. Some so-called "worker representatives" often used the excuse of "going to work for other units" to demand extremely harsh conditions from the "self-managed project" units, such as reducing construction quotas. For example, in the bricklaying projects of the state-owned Heilongjiang Provincial Timber, Department Store, Coal Construction, Hardware, and Vegetable Companies' "self-managed projects," the highest wages were 2.5 times higher than the state regulations; for making a door leaf, the highest wages were 3.7 times higher than the state regulations. Some "self-managed project" units adopted a partial hourly wage system, with standards 30% to 50% higher than the state regulations. The wage treatment for overtime was even more generous, with some stipulating that three yuan would be paid for three hours of overtime from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day. This approach not only increased project costs but also affected the production morale of some workers in state-owned construction enterprises. It has now been discovered that some workers in state-owned construction enterprises are taking advantage of Sundays or evening rest time to secretly work for "self-managed project" units, and some have even simply quit their jobs, affecting the progress of key projects.

Because "self-managed projects" have developed blindly, the state cannot plan and organize the supply of various construction materials needed in advance. These units compete to buy everywhere at high prices, causing price fluctuations. Some units purchase steel bars in the market at prices more than double the state regulations, and some units cannot buy materials locally and do not hesitate to spend more on transportation to buy them from other places. Some of the small hardware materials purchased from other places by some units were originally supplied by Harbin City. The round-trip transportation is expensive and wastes transportation capacity. The phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes and using superior materials for inferior purposes is even more common.

"Self-managed projects" also have many problems in engineering design and construction management. The main reason is that the leading cadres of these projects are mostly transferred from the administrative departments within their units and do not understand technology. Some cannot find design units and find some "technical personnel" with very low skills to design themselves, which is not only very expensive but also full of errors. The club and canteen designed by the Provincial Pharmaceutical Company itself is a public place and should be higher than ordinary houses to facilitate ventilation, but it was only designed to be 2.8 meters high, which is very unsuitable; and the foundation design was also wrong. The assembly workshop of the Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is also a "self-managed project." They did not have a design and only asked a carpenter to draw a sketch before starting construction. As a result, the roof truss timber was too large, making it top-heavy. The quality of such self-managed projects is also poor. The walls of the Provincial Petroleum Company are crooked, and the interior walls are uneven. The bricklaying of the Provincial Cultural Bureau's school project is very rough, the mortar joints are uneven, the seams are large, some are two or three centimeters, and some of the interior walls protrude three or four centimeters outwards.

Why are there so many "self-managed projects"? The main reason is that the leading comrades of many units lack a comprehensive view of construction and only see the needs but not the possibilities; they want to do all the good things all at once. For example, in August of last year, after the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Commerce hurriedly allocated 350,000 yuan of "capital construction" funds to its subordinate professional companies, it issued a "urgent" order requiring these units to spend all the money by the end of the year. In this way, when the state and local construction forces were insufficient and unable to undertake these projects, "self-managed projects" sprung up like mushrooms after rain.

In order to correct the serious waste of "self-managed projects," the Provincial Basic Construction Office and other relevant departments are taking some necessary measures. For example, they require all "self-managed project" units to resolutely implement the state construction quotas and correct various unreasonable wage forms; in winter construction, they must strengthen construction management and technical management, and resolutely oppose the phenomenon of simply pursuing progress and ignoring quality. The labor department is also stepping up the organization, leadership, and management education of scattered workers and abolishing the disguised feudal foreman system. Some units have also proposed setting up a construction bureau in the city to specifically manage "self-managed projects," and this suggestion is still under consideration by all parties. After these measures are taken, the chaos and waste in "self-managed projects" will be changed.

    “自营工程”带来些什么？
    本报记者　康伟中
    在哈尔滨，近半年来有许多机关、团体、企业和学校都在建筑办公楼、小型厂房或宿舍。其中有的在建设伊始，还曾向国家建筑行政部门备过案，办过手续；更多的是谁也没有告诉，就在本单位内抽调干部，到社会上招雇工人，在市场上乱抓材料，干起来了。如果不是最近黑龙江省人民委员会基本建设办公室和哈尔滨市建筑工程局进行检查，这片基本建设中的“无人管理的自由市场”将不知泛滥到何时！根据检查来看，在哈尔滨市这样的建筑单位有一百六十八个，建筑面积仅1956年下半年即达三十万平方公尺。在黑龙江省其他城市也有类似情况。由于这些工程是本单位自己经营，自己管理，独立核算，自负盈亏的，所以人们管它叫“自营工程”。
    用不着怀疑，各建设单位主观上都是竭力想把“自营工程”建好的，可是由于“自营工程”没有纳入国家计划，实际上常常建不成，而且给国家造成无法估计的损失。
    以招雇工人来说，“自营工程”给国家带来的损失就够可观了。本来，哈尔滨各重点工程的劳动力已感不足，散布在市上的零星的建筑工人为数很少，各“自营工程”单位为了完成任务，却竞相抢拉工人。在本市招雇工人的单位，大多采取“小包工”的形式，即通过所谓“工人代表”，讲好价钱后，由“工人代表”到各处私拉工人，甚至到重点工程工地去拉工人。这种“小包工”，不仅产生了把头剥削，而且漫无止境地提高了工资水平。一些所谓“工人代表”常常以“到别的单位去干”为借口，提出降低施工定额等极为苛刻的条件要挟“自营工程”单位。如国营黑龙江省木材、百货、煤建、五金、蔬菜等公司的“自营工程”，在砌砖工程上，最高的工资较国家规定高二点五倍；作一个门扇，最高的工资较国家规定高三点七倍。有的“自营工程”单位采用一部分计时工资制，标准也比国家规定高30％至50％。至于加班加点的工资待遇更为优厚，有的规定每日晚六时到九时加点三小时，付工资三元。这种作法不仅增加了工程成本，也影响了国营建筑企业部分工人的生产情绪，现在已经发现有些国营建筑企业的工人，利用星期日或晚上休息时间，偷偷摸摸地去“自营工程”单位工作，有的甚至干脆跳了厂，影响了重点工程的建设进度。
    由于“自营工程”是盲目发展起来的，所以它所需要的各项建筑物资，国家不可能事先代为筹划、组织供应，这些单位就竞相出高价到处抢购，造成物价波动。有的单位在市场上收购钢筋的价格，超过国家规定价格一倍多，有些单位在本地买不到物资，不惜多花运费到外地抢购。有些单位从外地购得的小五金材料，原是哈尔滨市供应的。往返搬运，价格高，也浪费了运力。至于大材小用、优材劣用的现象更是普遍。
      “自营工程”在工程设计、施工管理上也有很多问题。主要是这些工程的领导干部，大都是从本单位内的行政部门抽调出来的，不懂技术。有的找不到设计单位，便找一些技术很低的“技术人员”自行设计，不仅造价很高，而且错误百出。省医药公司自己设计的俱乐部兼食堂，是公共场所，应该比一般房屋高些，便于通风，但是只设计成二点八公尺高，很不适用；而且基础设计也搞错了。哈尔滨市第一机械厂的装配车间也是“自营工程”。他们没有设计，只请一个木匠画了个草图就施工，结果屋架木材过大，弄得头重脚轻。这种自营工程的质量也不好。省石油公司的墙壁是歪的，而且内墙凹凸不齐。省文化局的学校工程，砌砖十分粗糙，灰口不匀，缝大有二、三公分的，内墙有的向外突出三、四公分。
    为什么会有这么多的“自营工程”呢？主要原因是许多单位的领导同志对建设缺乏全面观点，只看到需要方面，而没有看到可能方面；他们想把一切好事统统在一个早上办完。如去年8月，黑龙江省商业厅在急急忙忙向所属专业公司拨发了三十五万元“基建”款项后，又以“火急”命令要求这些单位务必在年底花光。这样，在国家和地方建筑力量不足、不能承担这些工程的情况下，“自营工程”就像雨后春笋似的发展起来了。
    为了纠正“自营工程”的严重浪费现象，省基建办公室和其他有关部门正采取一些必要的措施。如：要求各“自营工程”单位坚决贯彻国家施工定额，纠正各种不合理的工资形式；在冬季施工中，要加强施工管理和技术管理，坚决反对单纯追求进度忽视质量现象。劳动部门也正着手加强对零散工人的组织领导和管理教育，并取缔变相的封建把头制。有的单位还提议要在市内设一个建筑局，专管“自营工程”，这一意见各方面还在考虑。采取这些措施后，“自营工程”中的混乱和浪费现象将会有所改变。
