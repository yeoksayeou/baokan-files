Xinhua News Agency, Ruijin, 23rd—The youth league branch secretaries of twenty-two townships in eight counties of the famous old revolutionary base areas during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War—Ruijin, Xingguo, Ningdu, Yudu, Xunwu, Huichang, Shicheng, and Guangchang—held a forum in Mao Zedong's former residence, Shazhouba Village, Ruijin County, from the 18th to the 22nd, to discuss the issue of conducting revolutionary tradition education among rural youth. The participants analyzed the current ideological situation of rural youth and exchanged views on how to conduct revolutionary tradition education for youth and cultivate their spirit of hard struggle.

In order to collect historical materials for revolutionary tradition education for youth, they invited former cadres of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government and veteran Red Army soldiers living near Shazhouba Village to tell many stories of hard struggle in those years. At the same time, they also made special visits to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military families. On the last day of the forum, they went to pay homage to Mao Zedong's former residences in Shazhouba Village and Yeping Village, and the site where the First National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Representatives was held. These simple houses made them feel the hardships of the revolution and the simple life of the revolutionary leaders in those years.

The activities of Ruijin and other counties to conduct revolutionary tradition education are being actively prepared. The Ruijin County Youth League Committee decided to launch a "Study the Excellent Traditions of Revolutionary Elders Activity Month" throughout the county after the Spring Festival, requiring all young people to understand through these activities that a happy life can only be achieved through hard work.

    瑞金等县准备进行革命传统教育
    培养青年艰苦奋斗精神
    新华社瑞金23日电　第二次国内革命战争时期的著名革命老根据地——瑞金、兴国、宁都、雩都、寻邬、会昌、石城、广昌等八县共二十二个乡的青年团总支书记，18日到22日在毛主席故居——瑞金县沙洲坝村举行座谈会，讨论在农村青年中进行革命传统教育的问题。参加座谈的人员分析了当前农村青年的思想情况，并且就如何对青年进行革命传统教育和培养青年艰苦奋斗精神等问题交换了意见。
    为了收集对青年进行革命传统教育的历史资料，他们邀请住在沙洲坝村附近的前工农民主政府干部和老红军战士，讲述了很多当年艰苦奋斗的战斗故事。同时，还特地去访问了革命烈士家属和军人家属。座谈会的最后一天，他们去瞻仰了沙洲坝村和叶坪村的毛主席故居、召开第一次全国工农兵代表大会的旧址，这些简朴的房屋，使他们感受到了当年革命的艰苦和革命领袖生活的质朴。
    瑞金等县的青年进行革命传统教育的活动正在积极筹备。青年团瑞金县委决定在春节后在全县开展一个“学习革命长辈优良传统活动月”，要求全体青年通过这些活动，都能懂得必须经过艰苦的劳动，才有幸福的生活。
