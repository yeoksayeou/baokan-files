Reactions to Criticism

    Letter from the General Office of the Supreme People's Court:
    After the People's Daily published Comrade Su Hongzhang's article criticizing our court's waste on January 8th, and after repeated checks, we believe that although some of the content of the criticism does not entirely match the facts, it is certain that the waste phenomenon in our court is not limited to the few things published in the newspaper. We will, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, conscientiously examine and thoroughly correct all waste phenomena.
    Letter from Hunan Theater: Your newspaper published an article by Comrade Li Changming entitled "More Than Just a Lack of Consideration" on the fourth page on December 15th of last year, criticizing our theater for mechanically implementing the ticket purchase system. Our theater has investigated this matter and the facts are basically consistent with the reported situation. In addition to educating all theater employees, we have also established specific measures to solve the problem of ticket purchases for revolutionary disabled veterans to watch operas.

    对批评的反应
    最高人民法院办公厅来信：
    1月8日人民日报发表了苏洪章同志批评我院浪费一文后，经过我们反复检查，认为批评的内容虽有的地方与事实不完全相符，但肯定地说，我院的浪费现象还不仅仅表现在报上所刊登的这几件事情上。我们将根据二中全会精神，认真检查彻底纠正所有的浪费现象。
    湖南剧院来信：你报去年12月15日第四版刊载李长鸣同志写的“岂只是缺乏照顾”一文，批评我院机械执行购票制度。我院针对此事曾作了检查，事实与所报道的情况基本符合。我们除对剧院全体职工进行教育外，并订出具体办法解决革命残废军人购票看戏问题。
