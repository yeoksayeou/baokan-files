Xinhua News Agency, January 8th: Bonn Dispatch: The Yemeni Embassy in West Germany said in a statement on the evening of the 7th that Yemen shot down three British bombers on the 6th and 7th, and also destroyed fifteen British tanks.

A dispatch from Cairo said that the Yemeni Ambassador to Egypt, Abdul Rahman Abu Taleb, met with Egyptian President Nasser on the 7th. After the meeting, he told reporters that he had informed President Nasser of the recent developments in Britain's attempted conspiracy to occupy certain parts of Yemen.

This resolution was issued here last night at the end of a two-day meeting held by the Political Committee at the request of the Yemeni government.

The Political Committee also decided to hand over this resolution to the representatives of Arab countries attending the United Nations General Assembly, so that they can coordinate actions with delegations from Asian and African countries and other friendly countries.

This resolution will also be submitted to the President of the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
