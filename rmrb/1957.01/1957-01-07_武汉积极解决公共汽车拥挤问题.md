Wuhan Electric News from our Newspaper: Recently, the Wuhan Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has been actively working to improve the severe congestion on city buses.

Currently, the phenomenon of overcrowded city buses is very serious. The city has only 176 buses, but the average daily ridership reaches 200,000, and the highest on holidays reaches 340,000. Pedestrians often wait in line for more than one or two hours to get on a bus. Arguments frequently occur inside the buses and at the bus stops.

The reasons for the severe bus congestion are, on the one hand, the rapid increase in Wuhan's population, while the number of vehicles added cannot meet the needs; on the other hand, the city's public bus company also has many shortcomings in its work, such as unreasonable routes and early closing times.

In response to this situation, the people's representatives raised criticisms to the relevant departments at the recent People's Congress meeting. Now, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is taking measures. The first is to maximize the efficiency of vehicle use. They plan to have buses start their shifts earlier and delay the closing time, open express lines, strengthen technical management, reduce the rate of vehicle breakdowns, and accelerate driving speed, which will increase the average daily mileage of each vehicle from 43 kilometers in 1956 to 170 kilometers to 180 kilometers. At the same time, they plan to implement nighttime vehicle maintenance, so that people can rest while the vehicles do not, to ensure that all vehicles participate in driving to the maximum extent. The second is to reasonably adjust the routes. In addition, they have accepted the suggestions of the people's representatives and plan to consult with various units during holidays to rent transportation vehicles to participate in operation.

    武汉积极解决公共汽车拥挤问题
    本报武汉电　最近，武汉市公用事业管理局正在积极改进市内公共汽车十分拥挤的问题。
    当前，市内公共汽车的拥挤现象是很严重的。全市仅有公共汽车一百七十六辆，而每天的乘客平均达到了二十万人次，每逢假日最高达到了三十四万人次。行人排队等车往往等到一、二小时以上。在公共汽车内和公共汽车站上经常发生争吵。
    造成公共汽车十分拥挤的原因，一方面是武汉市人口迅速增加，而车辆增加的数目不能满足需要；另方面市公共汽车公司工作上也有许多缺点，例如线路不够合理，收车时间早等。
    针对这个情况，人民代表在最近召开的人民代表大会会议上，向有关部门提出了批评。现在，市公用事业管理局正在采取措施。首先是尽量发挥汽车使用效率。他们准备使公共汽车提早出班和延迟收班的时间，开辟直达车，加强技术管理，降低汽车抛锚率以及加速行车速度，这就可使每辆汽车行驶公里从1956年每天平均四十三公里提高到一百七十公里到一百八十公里；同时准备实行夜班保修车辆，使人休息车不休息，以保证在最大限度内使所有车辆参加行驶。其次是合理调整行车路线。此外，他们接受了人民代表的建议，准备在假日和各个单位协商租借交通车参加行驶。
