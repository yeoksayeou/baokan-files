Doing a Good Job in Reprinting Ancient Medical Books
Reviewing the Commercial Press's Re-edition of "Living Methods of Categorized Syndromes"
Zhang Dejun

The heritage of traditional Chinese medicine contains the rich experiences of our ancestors in fighting diseases for thousands of years. Recently, the Commercial Press has re-edited and published some ancient famous doctors' works, which is welcome. However, there are great shortcomings in the publishing aspect; the necessary collation work and punctuation work are generally done very poorly. Regarding these shortcomings, other publishers, including the People's Medical Publishing House, often encounter them as well. Here, I will only take the Commercial Press's reprinting of "Living Methods of Categorized Syndromes" by Zhu Gong of the Northern Song Dynasty as an example.

The Commercial Press printed "Living Methods of Categorized Syndromes" in 1939 when compiling the Series Integration, based on the Ming Dynasty's "Comprehensive Book of Orthodox Lineage of Ancient and Modern Medicine." This reprinting has been processed to some extent. However, there are still many shortcomings in the collation aspect, and there are still many errors in the wording and sentence breaks.

First of all, we know that people who engaged in collating ancient books in the past were required to achieve the following points: collation must be very precise, without letting go of a single character; not only should different versions be used for collation, but also the preceding and following texts of the book and other books with the same meaning should be used for collation; when differences in wording are discovered, those who can make their own judgments must indicate the source, and those who cannot decide who is correct or both are acceptable must also note them. Therefore, books that were carefully collated in the past not only had very few errors, but even if there were errors, it was easy to find out the details. Today, it is still necessary to learn from our predecessors when collating and printing ancient books. It seems that the Commercial Press did not adopt this excellent traditional approach when reprinting "Living Methods of Categorized Syndromes."

(1) Because it did not widely seek different versions for collation, but only referred to the Xu Rong engraved version, this resulted in not being able to supplement what was originally missing from the Medical Compilation version, what was not originally in the Xu Rong version, but what could be supplemented from other versions. For example, after "Pharmacopoeia of Cold Damage," there is a section on "Pharmacopoeia of Children," and both the old and new editions of the Commercial Press note: "Originally missing from the Ming edition." In fact, although it is missing from the Ming Medical Compilation edition, it is not missing from the "Living Methods of Categorized Syndromes" re-collated by Wu Mingfeng of Moling in the Ming Dynasty. As for the "Distinguishing Errors" attached to the Wu Mingfeng edition, after the "Major Bupleurum Decoction with Dragon Bone and Oyster Shell" there are also nine items of distinguishing errors, which are also missing from the Medical Compilation edition, and the Commercial Press seems to be even more unaware of this.

(2) Because it neither widely collected versions nor carefully collated, there are still a large number of missing words and misprints. For example, after Zhu Gong's preface in front of the volume, it is attached: "When I arrived at Suiyang, I saw Wang Xiansheng's Living Methods Book, printed in five places: the capital, Kyoto, Hunan, Fujian, and Liangzhe." According to the "Medical Classic Correction Book" quoted by Cheng Jiong of the Song Dynasty, after "Mr. Wang," there should be the word "said." The Song Dynasty's 18-volume Nanyang Living Methods Book also says "Mr. Wang said." "Kyoto" is a mistake for Chengdu, and the Xu Rong engraved version also makes it Chengdu. On the lower right of the Foot Yangming Meridian Diagram on page four (Volume 1), the foot description clearly says "between the middle finger and the outer," but the line on the diagram is drawn on the tibia. The original diagram in the Medical Compilation version is not like this. The explanation on the lower right of the Foot Jueyin Meridian Diagram on page ten: "The liver... has seven layers of leaves, one leaf is small, like the image of a wooden armor breaking." "Breaking" should be "cracking." The Zhouyi Hexagram Explanation says "thunder and rain arise and all fruits and plants crack the armor." This is where this statement is based. (Wu Mingfeng's version makes it "disassembling," which is also wrong.) On page forty-eight, the note "Zheng 32" under "Bupleurum and Cinnamon Decoction" in the second to third lines. According to the numbering of this formula on page 107, Zheng 32 should be Zheng 31. On page forty-nine, the interlinear note "Physicians should carefully examine" in the seventh line, according to the Xu Rong version and Wu Mingfeng version, "Physicians" should be "Great Physicians," that is, Imperial Physicians. On page sixty-eight, the note "Zheng 102" under the interlinear note "Honey Conduction Decoction Method" in the second line, according to the formula number on page 136, should be Zheng 112. (Wu Mingfeng's version makes it Zheng 110, which is also wrong.) On page eighty-one, the second line "Begin with Pinellia, Cinnamon, and Licorice," according to the Xu Rong version and Wu Mingfeng version, "Licorice" should be "Decoction." On page one hundred and thirteen, the seventh line "If the pulse is negative below, it is favorable," according to the Xu Rong version and Wu Mingfeng version, "negative below" should be "not negative." On page one hundred and fifty-five, the tenth line "Together with this formula, hearing it will not decay," according to the Xu Rong version and Su Dongpo's "Preface to Sheng Sanzi," "will not decay" should be "will be the same as not decaying." On page one hundred and fifty-nine, the sixth line, the note "Ephedra" below "remove the nodes, boil three times, bake," according to the Xu Rong version, "boil" should be "soak." Also, on page one hundred and sixty-one, the ninth line, the note "Apricot Kernel" below "remove the skin and tip, roast and stir-fry," according to the Xu Rong version and Wu Mingfeng version, "roast and stir-fry" should be "stir-fry with bran." On page one hundred and sixty-six, the fifth line from the bottom "Let it attack the tendons, cold causes tendon spasms," according to the Xu Rong version, it should be "cold attacks the tendons, then there is tendon spasm pain." On page one hundred and eighty, the third line, the note "Aconite" below "raw remove the skin peel open into eight pieces," should delete one word "peel." Also, on page one hundred and eighty-six, the ninth line "Therefore, it is defeated, because vomiting prevents eating," according to the Xu Rong version and Wu Mingfeng version, "defeated" should be "firm." In addition, on the fourth page of the appendix's phonetic annotations, the note "Gao" is "also written as Gao," according to Wu Mingfeng's version, Gao should be "Gao." On the same page, the ninth line, the note "Ha" is "ancient ling cut," should be "ancient he cut."

(3) Because when collating, if there are differences in wording, instead of noting the source in detail, but simply changing from what they think is correct, this often changes what was originally correct into something wrong. For example, on page forty-three, the fourth line "Irritable stool clumps," the word "irritable" is written as "dry" in the original text of the Medical Compilation version, and Wu Mingfeng's version also writes it as "dry," only the Xu Rong version makes it "irritable" here. Now changing it to follow it makes it unintelligible. On page one hundred and one, on the ninth line from the bottom, below "Ephedra," the original note in the Medical Compilation version has the two words "originally none," and the Xu Rong version and Wu Mingfeng version also have this note. Now it has been deleted. In fact, the previous line under the introduction to this formula clearly states: "Yi Yin's Tangye Theory adds Kudzu Root to the Cinnamon Twig Decoction, now the supervising edition uses Ephedra, which is a mistake." It shows that Zhu Gong's recording of this formula using Ephedra is following the error of the supervising edition, not the old form of the Treatise on Cold Damage, so it is noted below "Ephedra" "originally none," how can it be recklessly deleted! On page one hundred and twenty-eight, the second line from the bottom "The disease is in the Yang, it should be resolved by sweating, but instead it is sprinkled with cold water, as if irrigating it, the heat is suppressed and cannot be removed, making it even more annoying, and goosebumps appear on the flesh." The word "suppressed" is "yet" in the original text of the Medical Compilation version, and Wu Mingfeng's version is also "yet." "The heat is being yet" means that it is suppressed or blocked by cold water and cannot be dispersed; changing it to "robbed" according to Xu Rong's version is inappropriate. On page one hundred and fifty-six, the first line "Treat the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, suddenly there is a sudden cold breaking into the intense heat," the original text of the Medical Compilation version says "summer month" for the end of summer, and Wu Mingfeng's version is the same. This is about how, when you encounter sudden cold at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, you will develop a disease of latent heat, and it is not just about this time of the summer-autumn transition. Changing it to the end of summer and the beginning of autumn according to Xu Rong's version is very wrong. Is it possible that there is no change in weather of sudden cold breaking into intense heat before the end of summer? On page one hundred and seventy-three, the seventh line "Those who should be slightly beneficial, do not take it," the original text of the Medical Compilation version says "stop, do not take it" in the next sentence, and Wu Mingfeng's version is the same, meaning: if you get a slight benefit, you can stop and don't take it anymore. Deleting the word "do not" according to Xu Rong's version makes the meaning incomplete.

Secondly, when publishing ancient books now, people generally just make a point and a circle and that's it. However, in order to facilitate readers to understand the tone and meaning of the text, I think it is better to use new punctuation marks. If you neither use punctuation marks nor are responsible for making correct sentence breaks, but just randomly punctuate, then that's even more wrong. However, the Commercial Press's reprinting of Living Methods Book this time is exactly like this. For example, line one on page fourteen "pulse floating slow person · must scrotum not shrink · external evidence must be fever aversion to cold · like malaria as want to heal ·" should be punctuated as: "pulse floating slow person, must scrotum not shrink, external evidence must be fever aversion to cold like malaria, as want to heal." Line six on the same page "if sixth seventh day pass jueyin · pulse get slightly slow · slightly floating is spleen stomach pulse also ·" should be punctuated as: "if sixth, seventh day pass jueyin, pulse get slightly slow slightly floating, is spleen stomach pulse also." The last line on page twenty-one "all needle qimen · must drain do not tonify can · fat person two inch · thin person half inch deep." should be punctuated as: "all needle qimen, must drain do not tonify, can fat person two inch, thin person half inch deep." The second to last line on page twenty-five "Zhongjing cold damage pulse · knotted alternating heartbeat · roasted licorice soup govern it ·" should be punctuated as: "Zhongjing cold damage: pulse knotted alternating, heartbeat, roasted licorice soup govern it." Line eight on page twenty-seven "all is aversion to cold fever · and aversion to cold person occur in yang also ·" should be punctuated as: "all is aversion to cold, fever and aversion to cold person, occur in yang also;" Line three from the bottom on page thirty interlinear note "Treatise on Cold Damage cloud · yangming disease does not defecate · sixth seventh day afraid have dry stool ·..." (the book has "does not defecate sixth seventh day" text, all at "does not defecate" punctuated, examples not listed in detail.) should be punctuated as: "Treatise on Cold Damage cloud: yangming disease, does not defecate sixth seventh day, afraid have dry stool;..." Line three on page thirty-one "yangming disease spontaneously sweating · if sweating · urination spontaneously beneficial person ·..." should be punctuated as: "yangming disease, spontaneously sweating if sweating; urination spontaneously beneficial person,..." Line one on page forty-three interlinear note "Classic of Difficulties cloud · yin yang deficiency reality person say pulse also · Simple Questions cloud · yin yang deficiency flourishing person say external internal also ·" should be punctuated as: "Classic of Difficulties cloud yin yang deficiency reality person, say pulse also; Simple Questions cloud yin yang deficiency flourishing person, say external also." (this refers to the different theories of the Classic of Difficulties and the Simple Questions, not quoting the words of the two books.) Lines six to seven on page forty-nine interlinear note "...take guard travel outside pulse as yang · dominate outside skin between · guard qi road hence also ·...take glory travel inside pulse as yin · dominate inside muscle between · glory qi road hence also ·..." should be punctuated as: "...take guard travel outside pulse, as yang, dominate outside, skin between guard qi road hence also,...take glory travel inside pulse, as yin, dominate inside muscle between glory qi road hence also...." The last line on page eighty-three "again with minor bupleurum class resolve remaining heat · then heal after down · cover have body heat not resolve ·" should be punctuated as: "again with minor bupleurum class resolve remaining heat, then heal. After down cover have body heat not resolve." Line seven from the bottom on page one hundred and one "sun disease neck strong · several several reverse sweating aversion to wind person..." (this punctuation also seen on page sixty-seven line six from the bottom interlinear note.) should be punctuated as: "sun disease, neck strong several several, reverse sweating aversion to wind person,..." Line three on page one hundred and nine "body not ache · but heavy sudden have light time ·..." should be punctuated as: "body not ache, but heavy, sudden have light time,..." Lines six to seven on the same page "if sweat whole body · moist stop after take ·" should be punctuated as: "if sweat whole body moist, stop after take." Lines four to three from the bottom on page one hundred and fifty-one "three four day not resolve pulse floating person · should heavy take · sweating pulse sinking reality person should down it ·" should be punctuated as: "three four day not resolve, pulse floating person should heavy take sweating, pulse sinking reality person should down it."

Finally, let me offer a point about the "Publication Notes."

The "Notes" say: "This book... was originally named "One Hundred Questions on Cold Damage by Wuqiu Zi,... because Zhang Zhongjing was from Nanyang, and Hua Tuo once called the Treatise on Cold Damage a Living Methods Book, so it was renamed Nanyang Living Methods Book." This is based on Zhang Can's preface. But Zhang Can's words are completely unfounded. Hua Tuo and Zhang Zhongjing were people of the same era, and whether they ever met is not recorded in history. His use of the term "Living Methods" does not actually refer to the Treatise on Cold Damage. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Wei Zhi and the Biography of Hua Tuo in the Book of Later Han, the book that Hua Tuo said was "capable of reviving the living" was referring to his own work. Moreover, that book had already been burned. Therefore, Chen Zhensun's Zhizhai Book Record Solution does not follow Zhang Can's preface in explaining the title of this book, but says: "Zhongjing was a native of Nanyang, and the term Living Methods originated from Hua Tuo," which is more appropriate.

The "Notes" say: "Some characters in the Medical Compilation version are commonly used interchangeably, such as: one, one, two, two, pill, round,... etc., all have been unified." Let's not discuss whether this kind of unification is necessary, but in fact, this reprinted version has not unified the writing of these characters.

The "Notes" say that the "Medical Compilation version and the Xu Rong-collated Nanyang Living Methods Book" "are largely the same," and also say that besides the difference in volume numbers, "the Medical Compilation Book has Li Zijian's Ten Admonitions on Cold Damage at the end, and the Xu Rong-collated Book has Zhang Wei's preface, the Nanyang Living Methods Book Collection, and the names of the people who donated to engrave the book at the beginning." This gives people the impression that the Xu Rong-collated version has no characteristics at all. But that's not the case. For example: 1. When Xu Rong collated this book, he sought out various engraved and manuscript copies and made detailed collation notes based on these different transmissions, and all the different characters were engraved on the book's eyebrows. 2. In addition to taking various transmissions of the Living Methods Book for comparison, Xu Rong also took Zhang Zhongjing's Treatise on Cold Damage, Golden Chamber, and Pang Anchang's formula theories and made comparisons one by one. When there were differences in prescriptions, drug names, amounts, and methods of preparation, and other words, he also annotated them in detail on the eyebrows. 3. What is especially valuable is that Xu Rong was an old doctor who "passed down the profession for five generations and studied for forty years." He had no works handed down, but he made very good annotations to this book, which were all his experiences and insights from learning and practicing medicine. In addition, Xu Rong's collection of "Nanyang Living Methods Book Collection" extracts and focuses on the texts related to Zhu Gong's book from the Song Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, which is also very useful for examining the position and value of Zhu Gong's work in Chinese history. All of these are the advantages of Xu Rong's and Lai Fuyang's collated and engraved versions over other versions, so the introduction made by the Commercial Press's "Publication Notes" should be said to be insufficiently thorough.

In addition, Zhu Gong's Living Methods Book has made a great contribution to the study of the Treatise on Cold Damage, as many medical scientists have said in the past. However, the Yuan Dynasty's revision of the History of the Song Dynasty did not write a biography for Zhu Gong. Today, reprinting Zhu Gong's works, it is necessary to investigate the literature and introduce more about Zhu Gong's life. However, the "Publication Notes" made by the Commercial Press only uses sixty-odd words to introduce Zhu Gong's life, which is difficult to satisfy the readers' wishes.

    做好古代医书的重印工作
    评商务印书馆重版“类证活人书”
    张德钧
    祖国医学遗产蕴藏着我们先民几千年来跟疾病作斗争的丰富经验。最近，商务印书馆重版和出版了一些古代名医的著作，这是值得欢迎的。但是，在出版方面有很大的缺点；应有的校勘工作和标点工作，一般都还做得很差。关于这些缺点，其他一些出版社，包括人民卫生出版社也常发生。这里，仅举商务重印的北宋朱肱著的“类证活人书”为例。
      “类证活人书”，商务印书馆于1939年编印丛书集成时，曾据明古今医统正脉全书本排印过。这次重印曾经作了一些加工。但是，校勘方面仍有很多缺点，文字断句方面也仍有很多错误。
    首先，我们知道，过去从事校勘古书的人，都要求做到下面几点：校仇时必须十分精细，一字也不放过；不单以不同的版本来校，本书前后文字以及其他书有同文同义的也要取校；发见文字异同时，自己能下判断的，必须注明来历，自己不能决定谁正谁误或两俱可通的，也要并为注出。因此，过去精校的书不但错误很少，即或有了错误也容易查出底细。今天校印古书还有必要向前人学习。看来商务印书馆重印“类证活人书”做的校勘工作，是没有采用古人这种优良的传统作法的。
      （一）由于没有广求不同版本来校勘，仅仅参照一下徐熔刻本，这就使得医统本本来佚缺、徐熔本又原不曾有而由其他版本尚可补全的竟不得补全。如“伤寒药性”后有“小儿药性”一门，商务新、旧印本都注云：“明刊本原缺”。事实上，明医统本虽缺，在明秣陵吴鸣凤重校的类证活人书是并不缺的。至于吴鸣凤本附录“辨误”“柴胡加龙骨牡蛎汤”一条后，还有九个方的辨误，这也是医统本所佚缺的，商务印书馆似乎更不知道有这回事了。
      （二）由于既未广罗版本，又未精细校仇，这就使得脱文误字仍旧极多。如卷前朱肱自序后附识云：“及至濉阳，又见王先生活人书，京师、京都、湖南、福建、两浙，凡五处印行。”据宋程迥医经正本书引述此文，“王先生”下应有一“言”字，宋刊十八卷本南阳活人书亦作“王先生云”，“京都”乃成都之误，徐熔刻本亦作成都。第四页（卷一）足阳明经图右下，足部说明明云“中指外间”，图上标线却画在足胫骨上，医统本原图并不如此。一○页足厥阴经图右下说明：“肝……有七布叶，一叶小，如木甲折之象也。”折应作坼，周易解卦“雷雨作而百果草木皆甲坼”。是此语所本。（吴鸣凤本作拆，亦误。）四八页第二——三行“柴胡桂枝汤”下注“正卅二”。据一○七页本方编号正卅二应作正卅一。四九页第七行夹注“夫医当宜审谛”，据徐熔本、吴鸣凤本夫医应作大医，即太医。六八页第二行夹注“蜜导煎法”下注“正一百二”，据一三六页本方编号应作正一百十二。（吴鸣凤本作正一百一十，亦误。）八一页第二行“始用半夏桂甘草”，据徐熔本、吴鸣凤本“草”应作汤。一一三页第七行“其脉下负者为顺也”，据徐熔本、吴鸣凤本“下负”应作不负。一五五页第十行“与此方闻不朽”，据徐熔本和苏东坡集“圣散子序”原文，“闻不朽”应作同不朽。一五九页第六行，“麻黄”下注“去节，炮三沸，焙”，据徐熔本“炮”应作泡。又一六一页第九行“杏仁”下注“去皮尖，炙炒”，据徐熔本、吴鸣凤本“炙炒”应作麩炒。一六六页倒数第五行“令搏于筋，冷转筋”，据徐熔本应作“冷搏于筋，则转筋痛”。一八○页第三行“附子”下注“生去皮皮破八片”，应删一皮字。又一八六页第九行“所以便败者，呕不能食也”，据徐熔本、吴鸣凤本“便败”应作便坚。此外，附录释音四页第四行“藁”字注“亦作槁”，据吴鸣凤本槁应作槀。同页第九行“蛤”字注“古令切”，应作“古合切”。
      （三）由于校勘文字有异同时不是详注出处，而是只简单地改从自己所认为是的，这就往往把本来不错的反而改成错的了。如四三页第四行“躁粪结聚”，躁字在医统本原文是作燥，吴鸣凤本亦作燥，唯徐熔本此处作躁，今改从之，反而不通。一○一页倒数第九行“麻黄”下，医统本原注有“本无”二字，徐熔本、吴鸣凤本亦有此注，现在删掉了。实则前一行本方导言下明有注云：“伊尹汤液论桂枝汤中加葛根，今监本用麻黄，误矣。”说明朱肱录此方用麻黄是沿监本之误，非伤寒论方之旧，故于“麻黄”下又注云“本无”，岂可鲁莽删掉！一二八页倒数二行“病在阳，应以汗解之，反以冷水噀之，若灌之，其热被劫不得去，弥更益烦，肉上粟起。”劫字医统本原文作却，吴鸣凤本亦作却，“其热被却”意谓被冷水所抑阻或闭塞不得发散；改从徐熔本作劫，是不恰当的。一五六页第一行“治夏末秋初，忽有暴寒折于盛热”，医统本原文夏末作夏月，吴鸣凤本同。这是讲，当夏天和秋初时，忽遇暴寒，都要生一种伏热的病，并不是单讲夏秋之交这个时候的。改从徐熔本作夏末秋初，甚误。难道夏末以前就没有暴寒折于盛热的天气变化吗？一七三页第七行“当微利者，勿服之”，医统本原文下句作“止，勿服之”，吴鸣凤本亦然，意思是说：如取得微利，即可停止，不要再吃了。依徐熔本删去“勿”字，语意反而不完备了。
    其次，现在出版古书，一般都只作一点一圈了事。但是，为了便利读者体会文语气意，我认为还是用新式标点符号较好。假使既不用标点符号，又不负责作正确的断句，只随意胡乱点断，那就更不对了。可是，商务印书馆此次重印活人书，恰恰就是这样。如一四页一行“脉浮缓者·必囊不缩·外证必发热恶寒·似疟为欲愈·”应点为：“脉浮缓者，必囊不缩，外证必发热恶寒似疟，为欲愈。”同页第六行“若第六七日传厥阴·脉得微缓·微浮为脾胃脉也·”应点为：“若第六、七日传厥阴，脉得微缓微浮，为脾胃脉也。”二一页末行“凡针期门·必泻勿补可·肥人二寸·瘦人半寸深。”应点为：“凡针期门，必泻勿补，可肥人二寸，瘦人半寸深。”二五页倒数第二行“仲景伤寒脉·结代心动悸·炙甘草汤主之·”应点为：“仲景伤寒：脉结代，心动悸，炙甘草汤主之。”二七页第八行“均是恶寒发热·而恶寒者发于阳也·”应点为：“均是恶寒，发热而恶寒者，发于阳也；”三○页倒数三行夹注“伤寒论云·阳明病不大便·六七日恐有燥屎·……”（书中凡有“不大便六七日”文，皆于“不大便”断句，例不备举。）应点为：“伤寒论云：阳明病，不大便六七日，恐有燥屎；……”三一页第三行“阳明病自汗出·若发汗·小便自利者·……”应点为：“阳明病，自汗出若发汗；小便自利者，……”四三页第一行夹注“难经云·阴阳虚实者说脉也·素问云·阴阳虚盛者说表里也·”应点为：“难经云阴阳虚实者，说脉也；素问云阴阳虚盛者，说表也。”（此系指明难经素问立论之不同，非引用二书之语。）四九页第六——七行夹注“……以卫行脉外为阳·主外皮肤之间·卫气之道路故也·……以荣行脉中为阴·主内肌肉之间·荣气之道路故也·……”应点为：“……以卫行脉外，为阳、主外，皮肤之间卫气之道路故也，……以荣行脉中，为阴、主内，肌肉之间荣气之道路故也……。”八三页末行“再以小柴胡之属解其余热·遂愈下后·盖有身热不解·”应点为：“再以小柴胡之属解其余热，遂愈。下后盖有身热不解。”一○一页倒数第七行“太阳病项强·几几反汗出恶风者……”（如此断句又见六七页倒数第六行夹注。）应点为：“太阳病，项强几几，反汗出恶风者，……”一○九页第三行“身不疼·但重乍有轻时·……”应点为：“身不疼，但重，乍有轻时，……”同页第六——七行“若汗周身·润止后服·”应点为：“若汗周身润，止后服。”一五一页倒数第四——三行“三四日不解脉浮者·宜重服·发汗脉沉实者宜下之·”应点为：“三四日不解，脉浮者宜重服发汗，脉沉实者宜下之。”
    最后，再提一点关于“出版说明”的意见。
      “说明”中说：“本书……初名无求子伤寒百问，……因张仲景系南阳人，而华佗曾称伤寒论为活人书，所以改名南阳活人书。”这是根据张蒇序说来的。但张蒇的话根本失考。华佗和张仲景是同一时代的人，曾否见过面，史无记载，其用“活人”之语，实不指伤寒论。根据三国志魏志和后汉书华佗传，华佗所说的那卷“可活人”的书，乃是指他自己的著作。并且，那一卷书已被烧了。所以宋陈振孙直斋书录解题对本书名题解释已不从张蒇序，而是说：“仲景南阳人，而活人者本华佗语也。”乃较妥贴。
      “说明”中说：“医统本中有些字，通用互见，如：一、壹，二、贰，丸、圆，……等，都加以统一。”我们且不论这种统一有没有必要，但是在事实上这个重印本对于这些字的写法并没有统一。
      “说明”中说“医统本和徐熔校南阳活人书”“内容大致相同”，又说两本除卷数不同外，“医统本书末有李子建伤寒十劝一篇，徐校本书首有张惟任序文、南阳活人书征说和捐刻本书的人名。”这就给人一个印象，好像徐校本根本没有什么特点似的。但是，事实并非如此。例如：1、徐熔校勘本书时，曾寻访得多种刻本和抄本，根据这些不同传本作了详细校记，凡文字有不同的都一并刻在书眉。2、徐熔除取活人书各种传本对勘外，还取仲景伤寒，金匮及庞安常等方论逐一作了对勘，遇到药方、药名、分量和制法及其他文字有异同时，亦详细批注眉上。3、尤其珍贵的是，徐熔是“业传五代，学究四十年”的老医，他没有著作传世，对本书却作了很好的批注，都是他学医行医的经验和心得。此外，徐熔所集“南阳活人书征说”一栏，从宋至明有关涉及朱肱本书的文字，大体已摘录集中于此，这对于考察朱肱著作在中国历史上的地位与价值，也是很有用处的。所有这些，都是徐熔与来复阳的校刻本优胜于其他本子之处，所以商务印书馆“出版说明”所作的介绍，应该说是不够周到的。
    此外，朱肱的活人书对于研究伤寒论有很大的贡献，过去许多医学家都曾说过。而朱肱其人，元人修宋史却没有给他立传。今天重版朱肱的著作，是应该查考文献，对朱肱生平多作一些介绍的。可是商务印书馆作的“出版说明”介绍朱肱生平，仅仅用了六十几个字，这是难于餍足读者的愿望的。
