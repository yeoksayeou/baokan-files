   Large Mine Hoist
    (Xinhua News Agency) The mine hoist with a drum diameter of four meters, which was scheduled to be trial-manufactured during the First Five-Year Plan, was successfully trial-manufactured at the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant on December 30, 1956. After local test runs, the quality was very good. The production capacity of this large mine hoist is greater than that of any hoist manufactured in China in the past. In the past few years, the largest hoist trial-manufactured in China could only be used in mines with a depth of 400 to 500 meters, and could only lift 100,000 to 500,000 tons of coal per year. The newly trial-manufactured large hoist is suitable for mines over 1,000 meters deep. When used at a depth of 400 meters, the amount of coal lifted is more than twice that of ordinary hoists. This hoist is fully automated and only requires one person to operate it.

   大型矿井卷扬机
    据新华社讯　第一个五年计划中规定试制的滚筒直径四公尺的矿井卷扬机，1956年12月30日在抚顺重型机器厂试制出来。经过局部试车，质量很好。这台大型矿井卷扬机的生产能力比我国过去制造的卷扬机都大。过去几年里，我国试制的最大的卷扬机只能用在四百到五百公尺深的矿井，一年只能提升十到五十万吨煤。而新试制成功的这台大型卷扬机，适用于一千多公尺深的矿井，用在四百公尺深度的时候，提升的煤量要比一般卷扬机多一倍以上。这台卷扬机全部自动化，只要一个人操纵就行了。
