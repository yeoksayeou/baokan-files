Basic-Level Cadres Should Attach Importance to Forestry Work
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    Our country's forestry construction has made great achievements in recent years. The afforestation task of the First Five-Year Plan has been overfulfilled one year ahead of schedule. The slogan of greening the motherland within twelve years has become the goal for which the broad masses of people are striving.

    However, the large demands of national construction and people's daily life urge us to put forestry construction in a more important position and do more and better. The task of large-scale afforestation and forest protection in our country is to be undertaken by the strength of the peasant masses. Therefore, basic-level cadres below the county level, who are in direct contact with the peasant masses, should strengthen leadership and assume greater responsibilities.

    Over the past few years, the vast number of basic-level cadres have led farmers in afforestation and forest protection, done a lot of work, and achieved many results. However, some basic-level cadres still have some incorrect views on forestry construction, which hinder them from playing a greater role in this regard. It seems very necessary to clarify these issues.

    Some people think that forestry work is just digging pits and planting trees, nothing else. Therefore, they either simply ignore forestry work and let it go, or they take a temporary, rush-job approach to tackle it, paying no attention to organizational leadership or cultivation techniques. As for the issues of forest rights, forest tree ownership in cooperatives, and remuneration for forestry labor, they pay even less attention to resolving them promptly and correctly.

    Such thinking and practices are, of course, very wrong. Forestry, like agriculture, must adopt a series of scientific and technological measures in accordance with the natural laws of tree growth, from seed collection and seedling cultivation to tending and protection, and it must be carefully managed to form a forest. If the work in any link does not meet the requirements, the trees will die, resulting in the loss of manpower, financial resources, and time. Without the strong leadership of the vast number of basic-level cadres, how can these problems be solved smoothly? Now and in the future, whether it is to establish state-owned forests or cooperative forests, whether it is afforestation or forest protection, the labor force needed mainly relies on the vast number of farmers. In order to enable the cooperatives in various regions to reasonably arrange forestry production and solve some economic interest issues related to afforestation, forest protection, and forest tree ownership in cooperatives, how can it be done well without the specific leadership of local Party and government organs at all levels and basic-level cadres?

    Some people believe that timber is naturally useful, but forestry is not like agriculture, where there is no food to eat without farming. Therefore, they relax their efforts in forestry.

    It is very incorrect to separate forestry from agriculture. Forests have a significant role in protecting farmland water conservancy. The shelterbelts built in western Hebei and eastern Henan since liberation have already proven this point with examples. There, farmland is no longer subject to wind and sand damage, the soil has been improved, the cultivated land has been expanded, the harvest of farmland has been increased, and the income of farmers has been increased. In areas with severe soil erosion, there can be no developed agriculture without afforestation and other soil and water conservation measures. As for mountainous and semi-mountainous areas where forestry production accounts for a larger proportion, forestry production should be placed in a more important position. In some areas, farmers' income from forest by-products such as tung oil, tea oil, gallnut, pine resin, and fur and medicinal materials is one to two times more than their agricultural income. The production habits and characteristics of these mountain farmers should never be ignored.

    Many comrades know that trees are very useful, but they do not fully understand the tense situation between forestry production and timber supply in our country, and therefore do not pay attention to forestry construction work. Our country has a large population, but forest resources are very scarce. The forest area of the Soviet Union accounts for 33.9% of the country's land area, with an average of 3.5 hectares of forest per person. The forest area of the United States accounts for 32.8% of the country's land area, with an average of 1.8 hectares of forest per person. In our country, the forest area accounts for only 7.9% of the country's land area, with an average of only 0.13 hectares of forest per person. Due to the small forest area and uneven distribution, there are many barren hills and wastelands lacking forest cover, which naturally causes adverse effects on industrial and agricultural production. Forestry, as a component of the national economy, appears extremely backward and disproportionate compared with other sectors. Last year, China's timber felling volume had increased to about 20 million cubic meters, which is still about 5 million cubic meters short of this year's national construction timber needs alone. Due to the shortage of timber supply, the coal mines lack hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of mine pillar materials, and therefore have to reduce tens of millions of tons of coal production. The shortage of timber supply will become more and more serious as the demand increases year by year. If we do not seize the forestry work now, it will cause great difficulties for the future national construction.

    The peasant masses understand the importance of planting trees and making forests. As long as they have the opportunity, they are willing to plant some trees beside the village and around their houses, and they are willing to green the barren land and barren mountains and create more forests. The vast number of basic-level cadres should organize the enthusiasm of the masses, make a comprehensive arrangement for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other side occupations, and lead the masses to carry out forestry construction well.

    基层干部应该重视林业工作
    本报评论员
    我国的林业建设，在最近几年取得很大的成绩。第一个五年计划的造林任务，已经提前一年超额完成了。在十二年内绿化祖国，已经成为广大人民努力奋斗的口号。
    可是，国家建设和人民日常生活中的大量需要，督促我们把林业建设摆到更重要的地位，作的更多一些，更好一些。我国目前大规模地造林护林的任务，都要由农民群众的力量来担任，因此，和农民群众直接接触的县以下的基层干部，应该加强领导，担负起更大的责任。
    几年以来，广大基层干部领导农民造林护林，作了许多工作，取得很多成绩。可是，一部分基层干部对林业建设还有某些错误看法，障碍他们在这方面发挥更大的作用。把这些问题说清楚，看来是很必要的。
    有些人认为：林业工作就是刨坑栽树，没有什么。因此，他们对待林业工作，要末根本不管，听之任之；要末就采取临时一轰的做法突击一下，既不注意组织领导，也不注意栽培技术，至于林权、林木入社和从事林业劳动的报酬问题，更不注意及时正确地解决了。
    这种想法和做法当然是很不对的。林业和农业一样，从采种、育苗到抚育、保护，必须按照林木生长的自然规律，采取一系列的科学技术措施，经过苦心经营才能成林。只要有一个环节的工作不合要求，林木就会死亡，就会造成人力、财力和时间的损失。如果没有广大基层干部强有力的领导，这些问题怎样能够顺利解决呢？在现在以至将来，无论营造国有林或者合作林，无论是造林或者护林，所需要的劳动力，主要依靠广大农民来担负。为了使各个地区的合作社合理地安排林业生产，解决有关造林、护林和林木入社的一些经济利益问题，没有地方各级党政机关和基层干部的具体领导，怎样能够作好呢？
    有些人认为：木材自然是有用的东西；可是林业总不像农业那样，不种地就没有饭吃。因此，他们把林业放松了。
    把林业和农业分割开来，这是很不正确的。森林有保护农田水利的重大作用。解放后几年来营造的冀西、豫东防护林，已经用实例证明了这一点。在那里，农田不再受风沙的侵害了，土壤改良了，耕地扩大了，农田的收成提高了，农民的收入增加了。在水土冲刷严重的地区，如果不进行造林和其他水土保持措施，就不可能有发达的农业。至于林业生产比重较大的山区和半山区，更应该把林业生产放到更重要的地位。有些地区，农民从森林副产品的油桐、油茶、栓皮、松脂和毛皮、药材等等的收入，比农业收入要多一倍至两倍。这些山区农民的生产习惯和特点，是绝不应该忽视的。
    许多同志知道林木是很有用处的东西，但是没有充分了解到我国林业生产和木材供应间的紧张情况，因而不重视林业建设工作。我国人口众多，但是森林资源十分贫乏。苏联的森林面积占国土面积的33.9％，平均每人有森林3.5公顷。美国的森林面积占国土面积的32.8％，平均每人有森林1.8公顷。在我国的森林面积仅占国土面积的7.9％，平均每人仅有森林0.13公顷。由于森林面积过小，分布又不均衡，缺少森林庇护的荒山荒地很多，自然引起对工农业生产的不良影响。作为国民经济一个组成部分的林业，和其他部门比较起来，显得极端落后和不相称。去年我国木材采伐量已经增加到二千万立方公尺左右，这个数字只就今年国家建设用材需要来说，还少五百万立方公尺左右。由于木材供应不足，煤矿用的矿柱材料缺少几十万立方公尺，因而不得不减少上千万吨的采煤量。木材供应不足的情况，随着需要量的逐年增长，将要越来越严重。现在如果再不抓紧林业工作就会给将来的国家建设造成极大的困难。
    农民群众懂得植树造林的重要。他们只要有可能，就愿意在村旁宅边种一些树，就愿意把荒地荒山绿化起来，营造更多的森林。广大基层干部应该把群众这种积极性组织起来，把农、林、牧和别的副业作个全面安排，领导群众很好地进行林业建设。
