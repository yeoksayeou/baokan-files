Why Be Afraid to Speak of "Filial Piety"?
Yu Qihao

Recently, many people have sternly criticized the phenomenon of some children not supporting their parents, which is very pertinent. However, in the criticisms of some comrades, there seems to be a tendency to be afraid to speak of filial piety, which greatly weakens the force of their criticism.

For example, Guangming Daily published an editorial in July criticizing this phenomenon, demonstrating considerable initiative. However, the argument was only about "respecting the old and loving the young," without mentioning filial piety. People have reason to ask: Shouldn't the relationship between parents and children be different from the relationship between ordinary old and young people?

Comrade Huo Li's article "'Filial Piety' and Support" mentioned the issue of "filial piety," but he adopted a destructive rather than constructive attitude towards this issue, emphasizing the mutual support obligations stipulated by the Marriage Law and the "issue of legal responsibility." However, it is not difficult to imagine that relying solely on the power of "legal responsibility" is difficult to establish a harmonious family with a close parent-child relationship.

Is the moral category of filial piety really not worth mentioning?

Of course, "filial piety" was not only the main moral standard of feudalism, but also a tool for feudal emperors to implement their rule. Since the Han Dynasty, it has been often emphasized to "govern the world with filial piety," which is evidence of this. Many of our generation grew up accompanied by the struggle against this kind of feudal ethics. However, because we oppose feudal filial piety, we must fundamentally avoid certain moral norms between parents and children, which is not necessarily justifiable. In fact, it is capitalist society that fundamentally negates the moral category of "filial piety." In many capitalist countries, children leave their parents to live independently when they become adults, that is, they leave the "father's family" and establish "my family," and the two do not have economic relations. Due to this economic life, there is an unusually cold and ruthless attitude in their parent-child relationship. Under this social system, there will be no moral norms similar to filial piety. On the eve of the "May Fourth" Movement, people used this relationship as an example to put forward the individualistic requirements of bourgeois liberalism. In fact, the so-called thoroughness of this system in opposing the feudal system is far from sound, and it fully demonstrates the capital's profit-seeking nature, as Marx pointed out in the Communist Manifesto.

Needless to say, the comrades who write articles against the phenomenon of children not supporting their parents also oppose that kind of bourgeois thought and behavior. However, they are unwilling to raise the moral category of filial piety, as if this is an issue that should not be brought up again. In this way, they are in fact abandoning an important and indispensable weapon. Because, among those "who do not support their parents and can put forward their own theories," whom they have reasonably rebuked, there are obviously commonalities with the above-mentioned bourgeois thoughts and behaviors, and they do not think that not supporting their parents is immoral. They even used the solemn socialist language of "distribution according to work," but in essence, it hides the pus of capitalism. Precisely because of this, relying solely on the legal responsibilities stipulated by the Marriage Law is not enough. Don't some parents actually suffer spiritual abuse under the barely surviving "support"? Since the problem is related to morality, it cannot be solved smoothly by trying to put morality aside. Since the relationship between parents and children is different from the relationship between ordinary people, there will be a corresponding moral norm. People need new moral standards to oppose immoral behavior, and it cannot be any other moral standard, but a moral standard that targets the parent-child relationship. It is not enough to destroy without building. The problem still has to come back to filial piety.

In fact, why be afraid to speak of filial piety? Why should the moral scope of filial piety be left to feudalism to monopolize? A famous poem left three thousand years ago recorded the voices of the people under the heavy burden of corvée labor. What they felt first was not anything else, but "Unable to grow crops for myself, what will my father and mother eat?" Therefore, they issued a painful accusation to the "distant blue sky" ("Book of Songs," Tang Feng, Baoyu chapter). Isn't this kind of emotion a very close emotion of the people? We call the moral standard formed by the condensation of this kind of emotion and recognized by upright people as filial piety. It seems that it will not harm the meaning of the word and promote feudalism! In a society where people exploit people, the filial piety of the people cannot be truly and completely expressed. Only we, who are building socialism, can both overthrow the feudalistic filial piety that advocates "the father wants the son to die, and the son has no choice but to die," which is used to maintain the feudal system, and overthrow the exploitative system accused in the "Baoyu" chapter that makes it impossible for the people to fulfill their filial piety, and eliminate the ugly capitalist system that replaces all relationships between people with monetary relations. We have basically achieved this great achievement, so why are we afraid to list this people's filial piety as a project of socialist morality?

I think there is nothing wrong with this. Let us promote socialist filial piety! Let us use new moral standards to oppose those immoral behaviors that refuse to support their parents, and to build harmonious families with close parent-child relationships!

### 何必不敢言“孝”

    何必不敢言“孝”
    俞杞浩
    近来，许多人严正地批评了一些子女不扶养父母的现象，这是非常切要的。但在有些同志的批评中似乎有某种不敢言孝的趋向，这大大地减弱了他们批评的力量。
    例如，光明日报7月间便写社论批评了这种现象，表现了相当的首创精神。但那论点却只是“尊老爱幼”，而言不及孝。人们有理由问：难道亲子之间的关系不应该是比一般老幼之间的关系有所不同的么？
    霍藜同志的“‘孝道’和扶养”一文中提到了“孝道”问题，但他对这个问题采取了破而不立的态度，却强调了婚姻法规定的互相扶养的义务和“法律责任问题”。但是不难想到，只靠了“法律责任”的力量是难于建立起有亲切的亲子关系的和睦家庭来的。
    难道孝这个道德范畴真是不值一提的了么？
    当然，“孝”曾不只是封建主义的主要道德标准，而且还是封建帝王实行统治的工具。自汉以来，常强调“以孝治天下”，便是证据。我们这一代人有许多是和反对这一类封建礼教的斗争过程相伴而成长起来的。但是，因为反对封建主义的孝道便要根本避开某种亲子之间的道德规范，却是未必说得过去的。其实，根本否定“孝”这个道德范畴的倒是资本主义社会。在许多资本主义国家中，子女成年便离开父母独立生活，也就是离开“父亲的家庭”建立了“我的家庭”，两者不发生经济关系。由于这种经济生活便产生了他们亲子关系上的异常冷漠无情的态度。在这种社会制度下，就不会有类似孝这种道德规范，“五四”运动前夜的反封建斗争中，人们曾用这种关系为例而提出了资产阶级自由主义的个人本位的要求。其实，这种制度所表现的所谓反对封建制度的彻底性是远不健全的，它充分地表现了马克思在共产党宣言中所指出过的那种资本的唯利是图的本性。
    用不着说，写文章反对子女不扶养父母的现象的同志也是反对那种资产阶级的思想和行为的。但是，他们又不愿意提出孝这个道德范畴来，似乎这是一个不好再去提起的问题了。这样，他们事实上就丢掉了一个重要的、必不可少的武器。因为，在他们所合理地斥责了的那些“不扶养父母，而且能提出自己的理论”的人们中，明显地有着与上述的资产阶级思想和行为有共同点的地方，并且都不以为不扶养父母是不道德的。他们甚至使用了按劳取酬这个庄严的社会主义语言，实质上却是隐藏着资本主义的脓疮。正因为这样，仅靠了婚姻法所规定的法律责任等是不行的。不见有一些父母正是在勉强可活的“扶养”之下实际上受着精神上的虐待么？问题既与道德有关，便不能企图撇开道德而能顺利解决。亲子之间的关系既然不同于一般人与人之间的关系，那么便会有一种与之相应的道德规范。人们需要新的道德标准来反对不道德的行为，而且不能是什么其他的道德标准，而是针对亲子关系的道德标准。破而不立是不够的，问题还是要回到孝上来。
    其实，又何必不敢言孝呢？为什么似乎应该把孝这个道德范围让给封建主义去独占呢？三千年以前留下的一首著名的诗中，记下了人民在沉重的徭役负担之下的呼声，他们首先感到的不是别的，正是“不能给自己种庄稼，父亲母亲吃什么呢”？因而向“悠悠苍天”发出了沉痛的控诉（“诗经”，唐风，鸨羽篇）。这种感情难道不是十分亲切的人民的感情么？我们把由这种感情凝结而成的、为正直人民所公认了的道德标准称之为孝，看来是未必就会因词害义而为封建主义张目的吧！在人剥削人的社会中，人民的孝思不可能得到真正圆满的表现。只有正在建设社会主义的我们，才能既打倒了提倡“父要子死、不得不死”的、用以维护封建制度的、封建主义的孝，又推翻“鸨羽”篇所控诉的那种使人民欲尽其孝思而不可得的剥削制度，也消灭那用金钱关系代替一切人与人之间的关系的丑恶的资本主义制度。我们已基本上取得了这个伟大的成就，那么我们为什么不敢把这种人民的孝列为社会主义道德的一个项目呢？
    我看，这并没有什么坏处。让我们提倡社会主义的孝吧！让我们用新的道德标准来反对那些拒绝扶养父母的不道德的行为，来建立起有亲切的亲子关系的和睦家庭来吧！
