Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: TASS reports: The Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen Republic of the Soviet Union held an award ceremony in Ashgabat on the 21st to celebrate the Republic's receipt of the Order of Lenin. At the ceremony, Anastas Mikoyan, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, presented the Order of Lenin to the Republic on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, in recognition of its significant achievements in developing agriculture over the past year.

Mikoyan spoke at the meeting. He first traced the major measures of the Communist Party. He said that life has confirmed the correctness of the Party's resolutions.

Mikoyan devoted a considerable part of his speech to the issue of democracy. He said, "You know, in recent times American imperialists have been frantically touting the superiority of bourgeois 'democracy.' But what kind of democracy is American democracy? Outstanding communists are persecuted and thrown into prison, and loyalty checks are conducted among all government staff to see if they have been infected with communist ideas. This is considered democracy."

The content of democracy in Western Europe is nothing more than: under the guise of election fraud, casting a vote for one or another bourgeois candidate every four years, and then working like beasts of burden under the capitalists' regime. Voters are formally guaranteed full freedom, but they can neither change the government nor change policies. If we compare the "democracy" that the reactionaries praise in every possible way with the socialist democracy that exists in collective farms, the difference is obvious, and the concepts of these two kinds of democracy are worlds apart.

Mikoyan said that we should find ways to further improve the extremely rich forms of collective farm democracy. We must absorb millions of talented people to actively participate in work. This plays a significant role in accelerating the victory of communism.

Malenkov delivers a speech at the Chekalov award ceremony

Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: TASS reports: The Chekalov Oblast of the Russian Federation of the Soviet Union, and the Krasnoyarsk and Altai Territories have received the Order of Lenin. Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Belyayev have traveled to these states and territories to present the awards.

Georgy Malenkov, Member of Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech on January 23 after presenting the award at the celebration meeting held by the Party and Soviet of the Chekalov Oblast.

Malenkov focused on the international situation. He said that the most characteristic and decisive point of the current international situation is that the foreign policy of our Party, the actions of the peace and socialist camp enable us to ensure peace and prevent the launching of new wars. This is the main achievement, and it encourages and fills all peace-loving people with confidence.

Some events and situations that have occurred recently have once again clearly demonstrated that the Soviet Union, which tirelessly and consistently implements a policy of peace, can force the imperialists to pay attention to our strength when it is necessary to maintain peace and security. He mentioned that due to the Soviet Union's stern warning, the warmongers sobered up from their war adventure of aggression against Egypt; similarly, at the request of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, the Soviet army took action to stop the counter-revolutionary adventure of international imperialists in Hungary.

Malenkov then talked about the fact that the socialist camp has recently consolidated its ranks more firmly, and the increasing strength of the socialist camp is a reliable fortress of peace and democracy.

Malenkov said that the growth of peaceful forces in Asia is a clear sign of the times.

The recent visit of the Chinese government delegation to the Soviet Union once again demonstrated the strength and power of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The People's Republic of China is a powerful stabilizing force in the East, a fortress of peaceful development and progress in the East, and a force that has a favorable impact on consolidating world peace.

Kaganovich delivers a speech at the Krasnoyarsk celebration

On January 22, at the celebration meeting held in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, Lazar Kaganovich, Member of the Presidium Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, delivered a speech. After talking about the excellent achievements of the territory in reclaiming wasteland and delivering agricultural products, he said that the working people of more than 20 ethnic minorities in the Krasnoyarsk Territory are united in a friendly, working family and are fighting for the high tide of the national economy. This is the victory of the Leninist nationality policy implemented by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Belyayev delivers a speech at the Altai award ceremony

The Altai Territory Party and government held a joint meeting on January 19. Yuri Belyayev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, presented the Order of Lenin to the leaders of this territory at the meeting. The Altai Territory was awarded the government's highest honor for its outstanding achievements in reclaiming virgin and fallow land. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also awarded medals and honors to more than 12,000 advanced figures in the Altai, and 18 outstanding advanced producers were awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. Belyayev also delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting, focusing on some issues in current international relations.

    土库曼共和国、俄罗斯联邦的一个州和两个边区获列宁勋章
    苏联党和政府领导人分别到各地授勋
    在土库曼授勋大会上米高扬讲话
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联的土库曼共和国最高苏维埃21日在阿什哈巴德举行了共和国荣获列宁勋章的授勋大会。在会上，苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团把列宁勋章授给共和国，以奖励它过去一年中在发展农业方面所取得的重大成就。
    米高扬在大会上讲了话。他首先追述了共产党的重大措施。他说，生活证实了党的各项决议的正确性。
    米高扬以相当大一部分时间谈到民主的问题。他说，你们知道，近来美国帝国主义者疯狂地吹嘘资产阶级“民主”的优越性。但是美国的民主是什么样的民主呢？优秀的共产党员被迫害和被投入监狱，在全体机关工作人员中进行忠诚检查，看看他们是否染上了共产主义思想。这就被认为是民主。
    西欧的民主的内容不过是：在选举的骗局下，每隔四年为这一个或那一个资产阶级候选人投一次选票，然后在资本家的政权下当牛马。选民在形式上虽然保证了充分的自由，但是既不能改变政权，也不能改变政策。如果拿反动派百般颂扬的“民主”和集体农庄中现存的社会主义民主比较起来，就显然可以看到其中的区别，这两种民主的概念是有天壤之别的。
    米高扬说，我们应当想法子使极其丰富的集体农庄民主形式更趋完善。必须吸收千百万有才干的人积极参加工作。这一点在加速共产主义胜利的事业中起着很大的作用。
    在契卡洛夫授勋大会上马林科夫发表演说
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联俄罗斯联邦的契卡洛夫州、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克和阿尔泰边疆区获得了列宁勋章。苏联共产党和政府的领导人马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇和别利亚耶夫曾经分别到这些州和边疆区授勋。
    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、苏联部长会议副主席马林科夫23日在契卡洛夫州党和苏维埃举行的庆祝大会上授勋以后发表了演说。
    马林科夫着重谈到国际局势。他说，目前国际局势的最有特征的和最有决定意义的一点是：我们党的对外政策、和平和社会主义阵营所有国家的行动，使我们能够确保和平和制止发动新战争。这是主要的成果，它使所有拥护和平的人鼓起勇气和充满信心。
    最近时期发生的一些事件和情况又一次明显地证明，不倦地和始终如一地执行着和平政策的苏联，在一旦有必要维护和平和安全的时候，它能够迫使帝国主义者重视我们的力量。他提到由于苏联的严厉警告，使战争贩子从侵略埃及的战争冒险中清醒过来；同样，根据匈牙利工农革命政府的请求，苏联军队采取行动制止了国际帝国主义者在匈牙利的反革命冒险活动。
    马林科夫接着谈到最近社会主义阵营更加巩固地团结了自己的队伍，社会主义阵营日益增长的力量是和平和民主的可靠堡垒。
    马林科夫说，亚洲和平力量的增长是鲜明的时代标志。
    最近中国政府代表团的访问苏联，再一次显示了伟大的中苏两国人民友谊的坚强和力量。中华人民共和国是东方强大的稳定力量，是东方和平发展和进步的堡垒，是对巩固世界和平起有利影响的力量。
    在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克庆祝会上卡冈诺维奇发表演说
    1月22日在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区举行的庆祝大会上，苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇发表了演说。他在谈到边疆区开垦荒地和交售农产品的优异成绩后说，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区有二十多个少数民族的劳动人民，团结在一个友好、劳动的家庭中为国民经济的高涨而斗争，这是苏联共产党执行的列宁主义民族政策的胜利。
    在阿尔泰授勋会上别利亚耶夫发表演说
    阿尔泰边疆区党和政府在1月19日举行了联席会议。苏共中央委员会书记别利亚耶夫在会上把列宁勋章授给这个边疆区的领导人。阿尔泰边疆区是因为开垦生荒地和熟荒地的卓越成就而荣获政府最高奖赏的。苏联最高苏维埃主席团还奖给阿尔泰一万二千多位先进人物以勋章和奖章，十八位最杰出的先进生产者获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。别利亚耶夫在会上也发表了长篇演说，着重说明了目前国际关系中的一些问题。
