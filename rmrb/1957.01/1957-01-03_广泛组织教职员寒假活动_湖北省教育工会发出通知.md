    Broadly Organize Winter Vacation Activities for Faculty and Staff
    Hubei Provincial Education Union Issues Notice
    (Our Dispatch) The Hubei Provincial Education Union recently issued a notice requiring education unions in various cities and counties to broadly organize winter vacation activities for faculty and staff, based on the principles of thrift, voluntary participation by the masses, and different interests, to help faculty and staff members spend a good winter vacation.
    The notice pointed out that city and county education union organizations must ensure faculty and staff have the necessary rest time during the winter vacation. This year's winter vacation should primarily focus on organizing activities at the grassroots level, with diverse forms and rich content. In addition to cultural, recreational, and sports activities, appropriate visits to factories and agricultural cooperatives should be organized, along with visits to workers and peasants, and the organization of get-togethers between workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Revolutionary veterans and older generations can also be invited to recount stories of their arduous revolutionary experiences, and teachers who have diligently established schools and persisted in mountainous education can report on their efforts in establishing schools under difficult conditions, in order to educate faculty and staff and promote the fine tradition of building schools diligently.
    To resolve the necessary activity funding, the Provincial Education Union allocated 150 to 250 yuan to each county education union and 500 yuan to each city education union (excluding Wuhan). It also pointed out the need to spend less money and accomplish more.
    For faculty and staff who have special financial difficulties during the winter vacation and Spring Festival, the notice requires appropriate subsidies to be provided. (Hui)
