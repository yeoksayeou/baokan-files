    Why Can't It Be Promoted?
    Zhu Deneng, a lathe operator at the Ningbo Iron Factory, successfully designed a machine tool guard in November 1954, which greatly helps protect machine tools and extend their lifespan. However, up to now, this beneficial invention has not been widely promoted.
    After Zhu Deneng created the guard, the Ningbo Iron Factory, although selecting him as a model worker of the factory, did not attach importance to the promotion of this guard.
    In early 1955, the Zhejiang Worker's Daily, Zhejiang Daily, and Worker's Daily all published articles about this guard. At the end of November, Zhu Deneng also drew the guard into drawings and took photos, sending them to the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry. In early January 1956, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry replied, affirming that this guard had promotional value and said that it was prepared to hand it over to the Second Bureau of Machine Building Industry under its jurisdiction. It was not until August 3, 1956, that the Second Bureau replied, saying that they had instructed the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory to test it. On August 21, the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory wrote, saying that they had encountered difficulties in the imitation process and requested assistance from the Ningbo Iron Factory. The Ningbo Iron Factory did not agree. Later, Zhu Deneng learned about this and requested to go to Beijing in person to introduce manufacturing and usage experience and to study the manufacturing of new machine tool guards with the Beijing factory. However, he still did not get the factory's approval.
    Now, the first set of machine tool guards has been out for more than two years, while many machine tools in various places are still naked, with deep scratches made by iron filings.

### 为什么不能推广？

    为什么不能推广？
    宁波铁工厂车工朱德能在1954年11月设计成功一种机床防护罩，对保护机床、延续机床寿命有很大的作用。可是，直到现在，这个有益的创造仍旧没有普遍推广。
    朱德能创造了防护罩以后，宁波铁工厂虽然评选了他为厂里的劳动模范，可是并没有重视对这种防护罩的推广工作。
    1955年初，浙江工人报、浙江日报、工人日报都发表了关于这种防护罩的文章。11月底，朱德能又把防护罩绘成图样、摄成照片，寄给了第一机械工业部。1956年1月初，第一机械工业部回信肯定了这种防护罩有推广价值，并且说准备把它交给所属第二机械工业管理局。直到1956年8月3日，二局才来信，说他们已经指示北京第一机床厂试验。8月21日，北京第一机床厂来信说，在仿制中碰到了困难，要求宁波铁工厂给予帮助。宁波铁工厂没有答应。后来，朱德能知道了，要求亲自到北京去介绍制造和使用经验，并且同北京厂研究新型机床的保护罩制造问题。但是仍然没有得到厂里的同意。
    到现在，第一套机床防护罩已经出世两年多了，而各地许多机床还在光着身子，被铁屑划成一道道的深痕。　　　汪闻望
