Spring Festival Memories
Jiao Yongfu

According to old customs, the grandest event of the year is the Spring Festival.

When I was a child, I eagerly looked forward to the Spring Festival. After the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, I would count the days to the New Year. I wouldn't relax until the thirtieth day. Seeing every household putting up Spring Festival couplets, hanging lanterns, and the scene of "renewal of all things" and people's busy activities, the children were even more jubilant. They had to run around and take a look everywhere. But then, a faint sorrow would cover them, fearing that this interesting time would pass like a flash before people could carefully savor it. So, they couldn't help but pray in their hearts, hoping that this day would pass slower, longer….

On New Year's Eve, the candles that "kowtow" were the most interesting to the children. These candles were finger-length and were said to burn out in the time it takes to kowtow once; in reality, they could burn for more than ten minutes. As soon as it got dark, the children would light the candles first, plant them on the edge of the kang (a heatable brick bed), examine them carefully, and constantly fiddle with the melted candle wax. In the pitch-black night, this small candle gave people light and could accompany the children to play, which was indeed a quite interesting thing. After the children played with a few candles, they naturally felt sleepy, but they were reluctant to sleep, fearing that they would miss eating dumplings.

In my hometown, when the three stars were about to fall this night, a "big paper" was sent off. The so-called "sending off big paper" was because it was said that when the night was quiet and still, the gods in the sky, such as the God of Wealth, the God of Happiness, the God of Fortune… would all descend to the world. Whether it was for "enjoying the joy with the people" or for "eating meat," in short, they were going to descend to the world, and the people had to welcome them as usual; in addition, the Kitchen God, who "speaks good things to heaven," would also visit the people again at this moment. At the same time, ancestors had to return home for the New Year. All of these had to be welcomed, and "sending off big paper" was a kind of welcome ceremony. A pile of fire was set in front of the door, a dining table was set up, a few cups of wine were poured, the candles everywhere were lit, and a few firecrackers were set off. The so-called "sincerity reaches the gods," whether they came or not was up to them. After welcoming the gods, it was time to eat dumplings.

Whether the dumplings were fragrant or not was not worth commemorating; what was important was the fun of these dumplings. Among the many dumplings, there were a few that had copper coins wrapped in the filling. My mother said, "Whoever eats it will be blessed!" So, when eating, they paid special attention, hoping to rely on God's protection to become a blessed person. Although I had never eaten one, I was not annoyed, and I have not forgotten the benefits of these dumplings over the years, so that when I mentioned the Spring Festival, the first thing I thought of was these dumplings, but I didn't care about the gods. This was probably because after inviting the gods for so many years, they never came once, inevitably making it seem mysterious and ethereal, and not as substantial as the dumplings for the people!

However, what I admire most is this: being able to arrange this night of "dividing the year at the fifth watch" in such an interesting and colorful way, making the world suddenly so magnificent, full of endless secrets, giving people a desire for pursuit, which is also a great creation!

Daybreak was the first day of the New Year, which is called "the beginning of a new era." Everyone had to congratulate each other. "Meet and get rich" was the simplest and most appropriate word, so it was widely spread. But this referred to when meeting on the street. As for visiting neighbors to pay New Year's greetings, the situation was completely different: upon entering the door, one had to kowtow to the family's ancestors, then kowtow to the elders, and then chat for a while, the topic being the plans for the year. "Kowtowing" was really troublesome, so the children had to hide away. Thinking about it now, "kowtowing" was certainly troublesome, but this New Year's greeting ceremony was not superfluous, it was a way to enhance friendship and unity. If the villagers had ever quarreled or had disputes, they achieved understanding during this New Year's greeting. Once the estrangement was eliminated, they naturally hoped to help each other in the new year! The children did not understand the meaning of this, and they did not care about it at all.

What attracted the most attention of the children were the newly married girls who "returned to their parents' home" with their sons-in-law. Originally they were playmates, but once they became daughters-in-law, their demeanor was different. They couldn't laugh out loud, they couldn't walk with the wind, they were like adults. Their clothes were also different from before, their faces were covered with rouge and lipstick, and a big red flower suddenly appeared on the top of their heads, and occasionally they wore an apron woven with cloud patterns. The most amusing thing was that they could no longer be called by their childhood names, otherwise it would hurt their self-esteem. The children were very confused, always trying to figure out why she had to be so restrained and serious. Was she pretending? Or was it unavoidable? Or did the son-in-law not allow it? Then, they commented on the son-in-law who came with her, "Look at his silly look!" They seemed to feel injustice for the bride.

From the first day of the first lunar month to the fifteenth, the two biggest things were eating and playing. However, that was not ordinary eating, there were "orders." For example, eating dumplings had to wait until after the "fifth day"; the sixth day was the beginning of the horse's movement, so you had to eat good food to show auspiciousness; the seventh day you had to eat "noodles" to "lock the legs of the children," and seek both prosperity and wealth; I forgot what else we ate later. As for playing, there were many kinds of tricks, twisting Yangko dance, walking on stilts, playing lion dances, making dragon lanterns, playing on swings…. For women, many taboos were also set, they could not touch needlework, they could not touch starch water, but the purpose was nothing more than to let them rest and play.

Thus, it came to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. The moon in the sky was like an ice tray, the ground was a world of lights, roads, warehouses, well sides, stables, mill rooms… everywhere were lights, some lights had riddles written on them, called "guessing lantern riddles." At this time, those old gentlemen who "make friends through literature" should show off their high talents and beautiful thoughts. They would transform an extremely ordinary thing into something so poetic, picturesque and thought-provoking. If someone guessed his most proud one, they would treat him with wine. After the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, "the beginning of a new era" truly began.

I have not spent the Spring Festival like this for many years. Writing this article now is not to express nostalgia for the past, wanting to go back to the old days; but I feel that the Spring Festival after all gives people a vast world, making life seem so colorful and interesting, using this to relieve people of the fatigue of the year, while nurturing new energy, encouraging people to explore in this infinite universe, which is also very interesting. Of course, the old way of celebrating the Spring Festival still has superstitious parts of gods and ghosts, but what are the new ways? It is indeed a question worth studying. The Duke of Zhou made rites and music, and we must also have our "Duke of Zhou"!

If this article can also provide some information for friends who are interested in writing "Research on Chinese Customs," then it would be an unexpected gain.

    春节杂忆
    焦勇夫
    按旧的习惯来说，一年之中最盛大的事件，要算是过春节了。
    小时候，盼春节的心切，一过了腊月十五，就要挨天计算，看离年下还有几天；直数到三十这天才算放下心。看到家家贴对联，挂灯笼，一片“万象更新”的景象和人们忙碌的情形，孩子们就更加雀跃，一定要到处跑跑看看，但随即又有一层淡淡的哀愁罩上来，怕这有趣的时光，还不等人们仔细地吟味它，便飞一般地过去。所以，总不免要在心里祷念，盼这一天过得慢些，长些……。
    大年夜，孩子们最感兴趣的，就是那“叩头了”的蜡烛。这种蜡烛有手指长，据说叩一个头的时间就要着完；实际上却是可以点到十几分钟的。天刚黑，孩子们便先将蜡烛点起来，栽到炕沿上，仔细地端详，并且不时地去拨弄那烧化了的蜡油。在漆黑的暗夜里，这小小的蜡烛竟给人以光明，并且能够伴着孩子们玩儿，也委实是一件颇有兴味的事情。等到孩子们玩过了几根蜡烛之后，自然有些发困，但舍不得睡，怕的是吃不上饺子。
    在我的家乡，当这一夜三星快落的时候，是要发一回“大纸”的。这所谓的“发大纸”，是因为据说当夜深人静的时候，天上的诸神，例如财神、喜神、福神……都要下界的。不知是为了“与民同乐”，还是为了“动荤腥”，总之，他们要下界，百姓就得照例欢迎；此外，“上天言好事”的灶君也要在此刻再度临民，同时，还有祖宗要回家过年，凡此种种都要欢迎的，而“发大纸”就是欢迎的一种仪式。门前拢上一堆火，摆上饭桌、倒上几盅酒，把各处的蜡烛点起来，放上几枝爆竹就算完事。所谓“心到神知”，来不来就凭他们了。接完神还要吃饺子。
    饺子的香与否，倒不值得怎样纪念；重要的是这饺子的有趣。在很多的饺子中，有那么几个，是馅中包有铜板的，母亲说：“谁吃到谁就有福气！”所以，吃的时候就特别留心，希望托天之庇作一个有福气的人。我虽则是不曾吃到过一个，然而却也并不懊恼，而且这些年来还竟没有忘这饺子的好处，以致于一提到春节，首先想到的便是这饺子，而对于神却并不放在心上。这大约是因为，请神那么多年终不见来过一次，不免失之玄虚飘渺，反倒不如饺子对于人们来得更加实惠的缘故罢！
    然而，我最佩服的还是这一点：能够把“五更分二年”的这一夜布置得这样饶有兴味和色彩，使世界忽然变得那么壮丽，到处是探究不完的秘密，给人一种追求的欲望，倒也是一件很大的创作呢！
    天亮便是大年初一，这叫做“一元复始”。见面都要恭贺一番的。“见面发财”是一句最简单而又最合时宜的话，所以流传得也很广。但这是指在街上见面的时候而言，至于到邻居家里去拜年，那情形就完全不同了：进门先要给人家的祖宗叩头，接着还要给长辈们叩头，完了便攀谈一番，题目是一年的计划之类。“叩头”委实麻烦，所以，孩子们都要躲出去的。现在想起来，“叩头”固然麻烦，但拜年这种礼节也还并不算多余，它是增进友谊和团结的一种方式。乡亲们如果曾经闹过红脸、口角的情形，在这拜年之中便取得了谅解，隔膜一经消除，进而自然是希望在新的一年中能够互相帮助罢！孩子们不懂这中的意思，对此也就全不在意。
    最惹孩子们注意的，却是同着女婿一起“回娘家”的新出嫁的姑娘们。原来是在一起的小朋友，一旦之间作了媳妇，神态就不一样了，笑不出声，走路不能带风，俨然乎大人一般；装束也跟从前两样，脸上抹满胭脂，还有口红，头顶上凭空出来一朵大红花，间或还扎着一条网有云子的围裙，最逗人的还是：从此不能招呼乳名了，否则是会伤了她的自尊心的。孩子们很疑惑，总要揣度她何以要那般拘谨、严肃，是装的？还是不得不如此的？抑或是女婿不允许？于是，又评起那跟着来的女婿了，“看他那傻样！”大有为新娘子抱不平之概。
    从正月初一到十五，最大的两件事是吃和玩。然而那不是平常的吃，是有“令”的。例如吃饺子要过“破五”；初六是马行车动的开始，要吃好的，以示吉利；初七要吃“面条”，借以“锁住小孩子腿”，求得人财两旺；以后还吃什么，我可忘记了。至于玩儿，花样也是满多的，扭秧歌、踩高脚，耍狮子，闹龙灯，打秋千……。对于妇女，还定出了许多禁忌，动不得针线，动不得浆水，但目的无非是让她们休息玩玩而已。
    这样地到了正月十五。天上是冰盘样的月亮，地下是灯火的世界，路上、仓房、井台边、马棚、碾房……到处是灯，有的灯上写着谜语，谓之“打灯虎”。这时候，那些“以文会友”的老先生们该发挥他们的高才丽思了。将一件极普通的东西，幻造得那么富有诗情画意耐人寻思，如果有谁竟猜到了他那最为得意的一个，便是把酒相待。过完了正月十五，“一元复始”才真正地开始。
    我不这样地过春节已经有好多年了。现在写这篇文章并不是发思古之幽情，想回到往昔去；不过是觉得春节毕竟给人们一个广阔的天地，生活显得那么多采和有情趣，借此解除人们一年之中的疲累，同时孕育了新的精力，鼓舞人们在这无穷的宇宙中探求，也是很有意思的。当然，旧的过春节的方法，还有神鬼的迷信的部分，但新的方法又是怎样的呢，也确乎是一个值得研究的问题。周公制礼作乐，我们也要有我们的“周公”！
    倘使本文还能为有志于撰写“中国风俗考”的朋友提供一点资料，那就更是意外的收获了。
