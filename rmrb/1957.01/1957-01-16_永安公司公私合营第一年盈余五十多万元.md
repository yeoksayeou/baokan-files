Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 15th: The Shanghai Yong'an Company, China's largest private department store, earned a profit of more than 500,000 yuan in its first year of joint public-private ownership. This is the first time the company has made a profit in the past eight years.

Since the Yong'an Company implemented joint public-private ownership on January 14th last year, its business has been very prosperous, receiving an average of 50,000 to 60,000 customers every day, and its sales have increased by two times compared to the previous year.

On the eve of the company's joint public-private ownership, state-owned companies allocated goods worth 360,000 yuan, and then the state bank provided loans for them to purchase goods. The company's 35 major categories of goods, including department stores, electrical appliances, new medicines, fabrics, furniture, musical instruments, and jewelry, increased from 11,900 varieties to 33,000 varieties. The originally spacious three-story shopping mall is now filled with goods on shelves and counters, becoming a truly comprehensive department store.

In 1956, more than 1,200 employees of the Yong'an Company comprehensively launched a socialist labor emulation campaign. They organized visiting work teams to factories, government agencies, schools, and hospitals in Shanghai to understand consumers' needs, and went to state-owned stores in batches to learn how to serve customers and promote goods, and formulated service covenants separately. Private personnel also participated in the employees' labor emulation campaign, and six of the eight private personnel won awards in the competition.

In this year, the Yong'an Company established a series of management systems for purchasing, sales, and inventory, and newly opened a customer-knitting service and a ready-to-wear service. Customers can entrust knitting and tailoring services there at any time when they buy yarn and fabrics. The company also signed "settlement agreements" with many factories, schools, hospitals, and other units, so these units can buy things with their seals without paying on the spot. The company's original mail-order service, telephone delivery, and delivery and collection methods were not only maintained but also expanded and improved. The mail-order service department opened a commodity purchasing service for factories, government agencies, agricultural cooperatives, and other units. Over the past year, they have received an average of more than ten times more mail-order letters from other places every day than before the joint venture, and their service covers remote areas such as Xinjiang, Tibet, Heilongjiang, and Hainan Island.

    永安公司公私合营第一年盈余五十多万元
    据新华社上海15日电　中国最大的私营百货商店——上海永安公司实行公私合营的第一年，获得盈余五十多万元。这是这个公司最近八年来第一次获得盈余。
    永安公司自去年1月14日实行公私合营以来，营业十分繁荣，平均每天接待五、六万个顾客，销售额比前一年增加了两倍。
    这个公司在公私合营前夕，国营公司拨给了价值三十六万元的商品，随后国家银行又贷款给他们进货。公司经营的百货、电器、新药、布匹、家具、乐器、首饰等三十五个大类的商品，花色品种由一万一千九百种增加到三万三千种，原来显得空旷的三层商场，现在货架、货柜都摆满了商品，成为一个名副其实的综合性百货商店。
    永安公司一千二百多名职工在1956年里全面开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。他们组织了访问工作队，到上海的工厂、机关、学校和医院了解消费者的需要，并且分批到国营商店去学习招待顾客、推销商品的方法，分别订出了服务公约。私方人员也参加了职工的劳动竞赛的活动，八名私方人员中有六人在竞赛中得了奖。
    这一年，永安公司建立起进货、销货、库存等一系列经营管理制度，新辟了代客编结绒线处和成衣服务处，顾客买了绒线和布匹，随时可以在那里委托编结和量体裁衣。公司并且同许多工厂、学校、医院等单位订立“结算协议书”，这些单位只要凭印鉴就可以来买东西，不用当场付款。这个公司原来有的邮售服务、电话送货、送货收款的方法不仅保持，而且有所扩大和改进。邮售服务部为工厂、机关、农业社等单位开办了代购商品的业务。一年来，他们平均每天收到外地寄来的邮购货物的函件比合营前增加十多倍，服务对象遍及新疆、西藏、黑龙江、海南岛等边远地区。
