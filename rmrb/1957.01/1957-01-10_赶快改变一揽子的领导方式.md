Quickly Change the All-Inclusive Leadership Style

Wen Yuan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

For many years, our Party has mainly adopted an all-inclusive leadership style in rural work. This was necessary in a tense war environment, with urgent tasks, scattered rural areas, and a small number of cadres.

However, the all-inclusive leadership style also has its drawbacks. Due to the emphasis on unity and concentration, a tendency to substitute the Party for the government has gradually formed over the years. In particular, the unified organization of work teams to go to the countryside and the centralized use of cadres from different departments have greatly weakened the role of various organizations. The Party committee takes on too many tasks and is bogged down in affairs, weakening the Party committee's repeated research and consideration of major work, principles, and policies, and neglecting the political and ideological education of Party organizations, Party cadres, and Party members, thus failing to better play the role of the Party's fighting bastion. Every time it encounters central work or major tasks, the Party committee convenes a meeting of heads of various departments to specifically study the issue of transferring cadres. The Party committee, proceeding from the central work, demands the transfer of strong cadres, while the departments, proceeding from their work, often transfer weak ones to cope, haggling over the number, quality, and time of cadres going to the countryside, resulting in conflicts between the Party committee and various departments, and between central work and business work. After business cadres are transferred by the Party committee, various departments often find themselves in a dilemma in their work. Their vertical superiors want tasks completed on schedule, and the Party committee assigns tasks with deadlines, leading to a situation of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. This results in both criticism from vertical superiors and accusations from the same-level Party committee. Cadres transferred to do central work, from accountants, salesmen, clerks to department heads, are mixed together to do work they are not familiar with, failing to utilize their professional expertise. Because work teams adopt the method of contracting townships, villages, and tasks after arriving in the countryside, they cannot better play the role of grassroots organizations. Some work teams or cadres often engage in paternalism and substitution, resulting in a situation where the work is lively when the work team is present, but cold and deserted after the work team leaves. Therefore, it is impossible to cultivate a large number of excellent grassroots cadres more quickly. The above shortcomings are extremely detrimental to the current work, and these shortcomings have a tendency to develop. Therefore, they must be changed as soon as possible.

Is it possible to change the all-inclusive leadership style? The answer is yes. The key to whether it can be changed lies in the leadership's determination and the adoption of specific measures. In order to change the leadership style, the Tangshan Prefectural Committee has taken the following specific measures: strictly adhering to the system of collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility. In 1956, all major issues in the region were decided through discussions at meetings. Especially when discussing important work or quarterly work, in order to give play to the organizational role and work enthusiasm of various departments, responsible comrades from relevant departments and Party organizations are absorbed to participate, which can not only enrich leadership experience, but also facilitate the unification of thinking, so that each department can understand the intentions of the Party committee as early as possible, and facilitate the arrangement of the work of the department. In order to change the past practice of uniformly organizing work teams to go to the countryside, under normal circumstances, cadres from irrelevant or less related departments are not transferred, but rather the central work is served through the business work of each department. To this end, after the Prefectural Committee arranges the central work or quarterly work, each department formulates its own work plan according to the general spirit and requirements. For work involving the entire region, it must be submitted for approval before it can be issued. Each department must carefully conduct work research and summary, and promptly submit systematic reports, put forward important new work experiences and opinions, especially the experience and opinions on how departmental work serves central work, so as to facilitate the Party committee to understand the situation in a timely manner and provide guidance. Due to the implementation of the above measures, the work enthusiasm and initiative of various departments have been greatly stimulated. The work of various organizations and departments has been established and strengthened, giving play to the organizational role and powerfully promoting the central work. For example, the Tangshan Local Committee of the Communist Youth League organized and mobilized more than 87,900 League members and more than 30,000 young people to participate in the fertilizer accumulation campaign in the spring, mobilized 180,000 League members and young people to participate in the water conservancy construction competition, and overfulfilled the region's afforestation task. Because the League organization fully played its role, it can complete the tasks given by the Party on time in various tasks, and truly play the role of the Party's assistant. The Tangshan Special District Women's Federation seized the work of mobilizing women to carry out the mobilization competition. According to statistics from eight counties in the region: before the launch of this campaign, only more than 230,000 women participated in field labor, and now the number of women participating in field labor has increased to more than 530,000. This not only completed the main business work of the Women's Federation, but also promoted and cooperated with the completion of the central work. The Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in nine months, transferred 130 people to conduct in-depth inspections of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to serve production, from the spring inspection of the supply of production materials to the preparation of supplies during the peak season, so that they were well-informed and worked proactively. The departments and commissions of the Prefectural Committee actively carried out business work, such as the Rural Work Department of the Prefectural Committee, which organized cadres to go to the countryside 23 times (2 to 3 people each time) to go deep into agricultural cooperatives to understand the key issues of each period. In summary, the effect of various units and departments serving the central work through independent work under the general work requirements is very great. In the case of numerous tasks, especially new situations, the central work tasks of each period are completed through the method of giving play to the organizational role, and the completion of business work is also promoted. This is a very clear contrast with the situation of the past all-inclusive leadership. For example, in the past, when the League organization encountered central work, the League Prefectural Committee had only two or three people left, one person left in the county, and some districts had none left. League cadres went to the countryside with organizational relationship bags. If they encountered someone who wanted to change the League organizational relationship letter, they had to run around to various townships and villages to find it. Naturally, because League cadres contracted tasks or contracted a township and a village, it was impossible to play the role of the League organization. Facts have proved that it is the best leadership method to change the all-inclusive leadership style to giving play to the organizational role of various departments and serving the central work through the business of various departments under the collective leadership of the Party committee.

Some people ask: Is it possible to change the all-inclusive leadership style at the county and township levels? Of course, the changes below will encounter more difficulties, but it is not impossible. The changes in leadership style at the county and township levels should be carried out gradually and with emphasis. In general work, resolutely do not transfer cadres from irrelevant or less related departments, but only arrange for them to carry it out through departmental business. For major tasks, only seize the relevant departments to draw sufficient strength to ensure the normal operation of daily work.

To change the all-inclusive leadership style at the township level, it is best to first select several townships with a good work foundation for trial implementation, and gradually promote it after gaining experience. Changing the leadership method at the township level is a long-term task. The key lies in continuously improving the working ability of grassroots cadres and giving play to the role of grassroots organizations.

Of course, there is still a serious problem in the township-level agencies, that is, the quality of cadres is weak and they cannot cope with the increasingly heavy rural work. Changing the all-inclusive leadership style cannot fundamentally solve this problem. Therefore, while emphasizing the township-level agencies to change the all-inclusive leadership style, we must pay attention to strengthening the leadership force of the township-level agencies. The current work of streamlining the upper levels and enriching the grassroots is precisely to fundamentally solve this problem. And the strengthening of the leadership force of grassroots organizations creates more favorable conditions for changing the all-inclusive leadership style. It should be noted that in the early stages of changing the all-inclusive leadership style, decentralism may be encountered, but this can be corrected by reviewing documents and meetings and other controls, and confidence should not be shaken because of this.

In short, our Party must lead everything, which is determined by the nature of the Party. Therefore, in order to lead the normal progress of all work, we must continuously improve the leadership method, and the change of the all-inclusive leadership style has a major role in the development of work. And wherever the change is made early, the work there will go ahead.

    赶快改变一揽子的领导方式
    中共唐山地委副秘书长　文远
    多年来，我们的党在农村工作中，主要是采用了一揽子的领导方式。这在紧张的战争环境，任务紧迫，农村分散，干部数量少的情况下是必要的。
    但是，一揽子领导方式也有缺点。由于强调统一和集中，逐年来形成了以党代政的偏向，特别是由于统一组织工作组下乡工作，把不同业务的干部集中使用，大大地削弱了各个组织的作用。党委包揽任务过多，事务缠身，削弱了党委对于重大工作以及方针、政策的反复研究考虑，忽略对于党组织、党的干部和党员的政治思想教育，不能更好的发挥党的战斗堡垒作用。每次遇到中心工作或重大任务时，党委便召集各部门负责人开会，专门研究抽调干部问题，党委从中心工作出发，要求抽出强的，而部门从业务出发，常常抽出弱的应付，在干部数量、质量、下乡工作时间上讨价还价，致使党委和各部门之间，中心工作和业务工作之间形成矛盾。各部门，在业务干部被党委抽出后，常常在工作上进退两难，垂直上级要任务按期完成；党委给任务限期去作，顾此失彼。致使既受垂直上级的批评；又挨同级党委的指责。被抽出作中心工作的干部，从会计、营业员、办事员等到部门负责干部，混合编在一起，去作不熟悉的工作，不能发挥他们的业务专长。由于工作组到乡后，采取包乡包村包任务的方法，就不能更好的发挥基层组织的作用，有些工作组或干部常常发生包办代替现象，形成工作组在时，工作上热火朝天；工作组走后，工作冷冷清清。因而，就不可能更多更快的培养大批优秀的基层干部。上述缺点，对于当前工作是极其不利的，而且这些缺点有发展的趋势。因此，不能不从速加以改变。
    改变一揽子领导方式可能吗？回答是肯定的。能否改变的关键在于领导上的决心和采取具体措施。为了改变领导方式，唐山地委曾采取了这样一些具体措施：严格坚持集体领导与分工负责制，1956年全区的一切重大问题都是在会议上讨论决定的。特别是在讨论重要工作或每个季度的工作时，为了发挥各部门的组织作用和工作积极性，吸收各有关部门和党组织的负责同志参加，既可丰富领导经验，又便于统一思想，使每个部门早日了解党委意图，便于安排本部门的工作。为了改变过去统一编工作组下乡的作法，在一般情况下，不抽无关部门或关系不大的部门的干部，而是通过每个部门的业务工作，为中心工作服务。为此，在地委把中心工作或季度工作安排以后，各部门根据总的精神和要求，制定本部门工作计划。对于涉及全区性的工作，须经批准后方可下达。每个部门必须认真进行工作研究和总结，及时地作系统的报告，提出重要的新的工作经验和意见，特别是部门工作如何服务中心工作的经验和意见，以利党委及时了解情况并指导工作。由于上述措施的贯彻执行，大大激发了各个部门的工作积极性和主动性。各个组织和部门的工作树立并加强了，发挥了组织作用，有力地推动了中心工作。如青年团唐山地方工作委员会，在春季组织并发动八万七千九百余名团员和三万余名青年参加积肥运动，发动十八万名团员和青年参加了兴修水利竞赛，并超额完成了全区植树造林任务。由于团组织充分发挥了作用，在各项工作中均能按时完成党所给予的任务，确实起到党的助手作用。唐山专区妇女联合会，抓住发动妇女开展发动竞赛运动的工作。据全区八个县统计：开展这一运动前，只有二十三万余妇女参加田间劳动，现在参加田间劳动的妇女增加到五十三万余人。这样不仅完成了妇联的主要业务工作，而且推动与配合了中心工作的完成。专区供销合作社，在九个月中，抽出一百三十人，深入检查基层供销合作社为生产服务的情况，从春季检查生产资料供应工作到旺季物资供应准备工作等，作到了心中有数、工作主动。地委各部委，积极进行了业务工作，如地委农村工作部，前后组织干部下乡二十三次（每次二到三人）深入农业社，了解每个时期的关键问题。综上所述，各单位、各部门在总的工作要求下，通过单独进行工作，为中心工作服务的效果是很大的。在工作繁多，特别是新的情况下，通过发挥组织作用的方法，完成了每个时期的中心工作任务，同时也推动了业务工作的完成。这与过去一揽子领导时的情况是极其鲜明的对比。如过去团组织在遇到中心工作时，团地委剩两三人，到县留一人，到区有的则一个不留，团干部背着组织关系袋下乡，遇有换团组织关系信的，必须到各乡各村奔跑去找。自然，由于团干部包任务或包一乡一村，就不可能发挥团组织的作用。事实证明：不用一揽子的领导方式，改为在党委集体领导下，发挥各部门的组织作用，通过各部门业务来为中心工作服务是最好的领导方法。
    有人问：在县一级和乡一级改变一揽子领导方式是否可能呢？当然下边的改变遇到的困难会更多些，但并不是不可能。县级和乡级改变领导方式应逐步地、有重点地进行。在一般工作中，坚决不抽调无关和关系不大部门的干部，只布置其通过部门业务进行。对于重大任务，只抓住有关部门抽出足够力量，保证日常工作的正常进行。
    改变乡一级一揽子领导方式，最好先选择若干工作基础较好的乡试办，取得经验后逐步推广。改变乡一级的领导方法是一个较长期的任务，关键在于不断提高基层干部的工作能力和发挥基层组织作用。
    当然，目前乡级机构中还有一个严重问题，是干部的质量较弱，不能胜任日益繁重的农村各项工作，改变一揽子的领导方式，也不能从根本上解决这个问题，因此，在强调乡级机构改变一揽子领导方式的同时，必须注意加强乡级机构的领导力量。目前正在进行的精简上层充实基层的工作，正是为了从根本上解决这一问题。而基层组织领导力量的加强，就为改变一揽子领导方式造成更有利的条件。应该注意，在改变一揽子领导方式之初，可能遇到分散主义现象，但这可以通过对发文和会议的审查等一些控制来纠正，不能因此动摇信心。
    总之，我们的党要领导一切，这是党的性质所决定的。因此，为了领导好一切工作的正常进行，必须不断改进领导方法，而一揽子领导方式的改变，对于工作的开展有着重大作用。而且哪里改变的早，哪里的工作将走到前边。
