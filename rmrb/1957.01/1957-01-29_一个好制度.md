　　A Good System

　　The Anhui Provincial Party Committee recently stipulated that 181 leading personnel from various departments, including the Provincial Party Secretary, should each establish a long-term connection with a fixed agricultural producers' cooperative, regularly and concretely guiding the work of that cooperative. This is a relatively good system.

　　If a responsible person provides long-term, fixed, concrete guidance and assistance to successfully manage a cooperative, 181 people can help 181 cooperatives to operate well. In this way, 181 can be added to the ranks of excellent cooperatives throughout the province, which is already a very good thing. The benefits and significance of this matter go far beyond that. If these 181 cooperatives are indeed managed very well, more cooperatives will come to learn from them and follow them forward. From the perspective of improving and enhancing leadership, doing so also has considerable significance: In the process of conducting long-term, direct, and concrete guidance and assistance to a cooperative, leaders can both verify the correctness of the policies and measures set by the leading organs based on the actual situation below, and also learn a lot of specific knowledge from the masses of farmers, and obtain some first-hand materials that are not easy to obtain from meetings and reports – these are invaluable treasures for leaders.

　　The daily work of responsible personnel in various departments is generally very busy. Is it possible to also require them to frequently take some time to go deep into the agricultural producers' cooperatives to conduct specific guidance? It should be said that there are difficulties in doing so; however, if the leadership is determined, and if the responsible personnel of various departments can reasonably arrange their work and improve their working methods, this is by no means impossible. We believe that the Anhui Provincial Party Committee can persevere with this system.

    一个好制度
    安徽省委最近规定：包括省委书记在内的各部门的一百八十一名负责人员，每人固定同一个农业生产合作社建立长期的联系，经常深入地具体地指导这个合作社的工作。这是一个比较好的制度。
    一个负责人员长期固定地具体指导和帮助办好一个合作社，一百八十一个人就可以帮助一百八十一个合作社把社办好。这样，在全省优秀的合作社的行列里就可以增加一百八十一个，这已经是很好的事了。这件事的好处和意义远不止于此。如果这一百八十一个合作社办得确实很出色，就会有更多的合作社来向它们学习，跟着它们前进。从改善和提高领导的角度来看，这样做也有不小的意义：在对一个合作社进行长期的直接的具体指导和帮助的进程中，领导人员既可以根据下边的实际情况来检验领导机关所定的方针和措施的正确性；还可以向农民群众学习到不少的具体知识，获得一些从会议上和汇报材料上不易得到的第一手材料——这些对于领导人员来说，正是无价之宝。
    各个部门的负责人员的日常工作一般都很繁忙，还要求他们经常抽出一点时间深入到农业生产合作社中去进行具体指导，这能办到吗？应当说，这样做，困难是有的；但是，如果领导方面有决心，如果各部门的负责人员能够合理安排工作，改善工作方法，这决不是不可能做到的。我们相信安徽省委能把这个制度坚持下去。
