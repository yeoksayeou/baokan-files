    Patient Guidance
    Yi Mu

    The injection room of a hospital faces a small street. Children often climb onto the window sills, singing and playing, disturbing the peace inside. A nurse shouted at the children: "What are you singing, what are you making noise about? Get down!" The children, unconvinced, went down, but climbed back up a moment later, chanting in unison, "We insist on singing, we insist on shouting!" The nurse, unwilling to give up, shouted even louder, "If you make any more noise, I'll pour water on you!" The children, frightened, retreated, but shouted and sang even louder outside the wall.

    Before long, the children poked their heads out again. This time they encountered another nurse. This nurse said, "Little friends, the patients need quiet. Would you please play somewhere else?" Her words were very gentle. The children felt they were in the wrong, and one by one, with their bright eyes rolling, they quietly went down from the window. A child took the lead and walked away outside the wall, saying "Goodbye, Auntie!" The other children followed suit, shouting "Goodbye, Auntie!" The nurse waved to them and said, "Goodbye, children!"

    The different attitudes of the two nurses, and the two different responses of the children, often linger in my mind.

    I think of some people around me.

    People who like to yell at others, people who like to achieve their goals through punishment, always find that the outcome is the opposite of what they intended. Sometimes, this result comes quickly and obviously, like the first nurse's treatment of the children. The children immediately resisted and shouted and made noise incessantly. At other times, it is more concealed and not easily noticed, which requires self-reflection, exploration, and discovery. The two news items published by the New China News Agency last year about the leaders of two enterprises learning lessons from punishmentism are examples of this situation.

    In the first half of the year before last, the Fourth Mine of the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine, because it failed to complete its production tasks, formulated more than ten methods to deduct workers' wages. At the beginning of last year, the Lilishan Station of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel, because it had the most accidents and the worst task completion, punished employees by deducting bonuses, reducing salaries, demoting, and recording demerits. Although these measures did not encounter direct and obvious opposition at the time, the consequences they brought were the same. The stricter the punishment, the more the enthusiasm of the workers for production was hurt, and the more difficult it was to save the backward situation in production and transportation.

    This situation forced the leaders of these enterprises to engage in self-reflection and exploration. They discovered the root of the error, abolished punishmentism, and replaced it with patient guidance; they abolished issuing orders and replaced it with caring about the sufferings of the workers. They also studied difficulties and overcame difficulties together with the workers. This change in leadership style is undoubtedly correct. However, before this change, the abnormal state of production at the Fourth Mine of Fengfeng Coal Mine had lasted for nearly a year; the frequent accidents at Lilishan Station had also dragged on for nine months.

    Don't think that the opposition encountered by punishmentism only needs to be resolved immediately when it stirs up waves like the first nurse's treatment of the children. Other things can proceed slowly, be allowed to take their course, and will be resolved when "water flows and the channel is formed." Unfortunately, life itself does not follow these people's subjective arrangements. Water may arrive as the channel forms, but it will never pave the way for these people. Raging waves begin with ripples, and serious consequences accumulate from small drops. People who are accustomed to yelling at and punishing others, if they do not constantly engage in self-reflection and correct themselves immediately, will inevitably be swept away and submerged by the waves they have stirred up themselves.

    循循善诱
    伊木
    一所医院的注射室，窗外临小街。孩子们经常攀上窗栏，边唱边玩，扰乱室内的宁静。一个护士向孩子喝道：“唱什么，闹什么，快下去！”孩子不服地下去了，一会又爬上来，齐声说：“偏要唱，偏要喊！”护士不甘心，又大喝道：“再闹就用水浇！”孩子们吓得退下去了，可是在墙外越发大喊大唱起来。
    不多久，孩子们又探出头来。这次他们遇到的是另一个护士。这个护士说：“小朋友，病人要安静，你们到别处玩好吗？”话说得很平和，孩子们感到自己不对了，一个个滚动着乌溜溜的眼睛，不作声，悄悄地下到窗外。一个孩子在墙外带头走开了，说了一声“阿姨再见！”其他的孩子也跟着喊“阿姨再见！”护士向他们挥手说：“小朋友再见！”
    两个护士的不同态度，孩子们的两种不同表现，时常萦绕在我的脑子里。
    我想起周围的一些人来。
    欢喜吆喝人的人，欢喜用惩办达到目的的人，事情的结果总是适得其反的。有时，这种结果来得很快，很明显，像前一个护士对待孩子那样，孩子们立即反抗，大喊大闹不止；有时，却是较隐蔽，不易觉察的，这就须要自己去自省，去探究，去发掘。新华社去年发表过的两处企业领导人员接受惩办主义教训的两则新闻，便是这种情况的例证。
    国营峰峰煤矿四矿前年上半年，由于生产任务完不成，便订出十多种办法扣罚工人的工资；鞍钢运输部立山站去年初，由于事故最多，任务完成得最差，便以扣奖金、降薪、降职、记过等处分职工。这些措施，当时虽未遭到直接、明显的反对，可是它所带来的后果，却是一样。惩办愈严，职工生产积极性愈受到伤害，生产和运输落后的窘境愈加难以挽救。
    这种局面，迫使这些企业的领导人员进行自省和探究。他们发掘错误的根源，废除了惩办主义，代之以循循善诱；废除了发号施令，代之以关心职工的疾苦。并和职工一道研究困难，克服困难。领导作风的这种改变，无疑是正确的。但是在这种改变以前，峰峰煤矿四矿生产不正常状态，已持续了近一年之久；立山站经常出事故的情况，也拖延达九个月之久。
    不要以为，惩办主义所遭遇到的反对，只有像前一个护士对待孩子们那样所激起的波涛，才认为是急不容缓，要立即去解决。其他都可以缓步而行，听其自然，到“水到渠成”时，总归会解决的。可惜，生活的本身，不会按照这些人的主观安排。水到渠将成，但决不会为这些人开辟道路。汹涌的波涛始于鳞波细浪，严重的后果由于点滴的积累。习惯于吆喝人、惩办人的人，如果不时刻自省，即起纠正，就必然会为自己所掀起的波涛席卷淹没。
