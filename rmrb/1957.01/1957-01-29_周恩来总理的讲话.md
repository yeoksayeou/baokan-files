Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Your Excellency Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya, Respected Chairman Hari Bhakta Shrestha, Dear Nepalese friends:

I sincerely thank you for giving me and my colleagues such a warm welcome. Words cannot express the emotion that the moments we have spent here have given us. From the smiles and eyes of the countless people who welcomed us on the streets yesterday, and who are joyfully gathering with us in this square today, we see the sincere and deep friendship of the Nepalese people towards the Chinese people. And the purpose of our visit is precisely to bring the friendship of the Chinese people living on the other side of the Himalayas to the Nepalese people living on this side of the Himalayas. Now, in the name of the Chinese people, I extend cordial greetings and high respect to you, to all the Nepalese people.

Dear friends: As I stand in this square, together with thousands upon thousands of Nepalese people, precious memories of past times once again flood my mind. Although the world's most perilous Himalayas lie between our two countries, our people have maintained friendly exchanges since ancient times, exchanging their cultural creations and their achievements in agriculture and handicrafts. Among those who have contributed to the development of friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese peoples, Faxian, Xuanzang, and Arniko have left the most brilliant names. These names have become a signal to encourage us to continue to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese peoples.

In modern times, the relationship between our two countries has also experienced a period of relative stagnation and darkness. After Western colonialists extended their influence to the East, they repeatedly attempted to sever the relationship between us and sow seeds of discord among us. However, even at such times, we have always maintained deep sympathy for each other. The demand to restore and develop the historical ties and unity between Asian countries has always been our common ideal.

We are very pleased that our ideal has now been realized. Asia and the entire East have now begun a great era of awakening and revival. The first Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in 1955 loudly declared the strong will of the 1.6 billion people in the Asian-African region to promote international friendship and safeguard world peace. It is in this context that the ancient friendship between China and Nepal has not only been restored but has also been newly developed. When establishing diplomatic relations between our two countries, we explicitly declared the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—Panchsheel—jointly initiated by China and India as the basic principles guiding the relations between the two countries. On such a new and solid foundation, we smoothly resolved various historical issues in the relations between the two countries and signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Transportation between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal." It has opened up broad avenues for developing economic and cultural ties between our two countries. Three months ago, Your Excellency Acharya visited China as the first Nepalese Prime Minister in history. This has become an important milestone in the history of the development of relations between China and Nepal. Now, we have come to Nepal to meet the vast number of Nepalese people. We deeply feel that the friendship between the people of our two countries is constantly growing.

The Chinese people cherish friendship with Nepal very much. The people of our two countries are working hard to build our respective countries. The Chinese people have always believed that all countries, regardless of size, are equal and have their own strengths worthy of learning by other countries. In history, Nepal was once a place where Chinese scholars and artisans sought knowledge and technology; similarly, Chinese culture once influenced Nepal. Today, mutual learning and mutual assistance between our two countries in construction will surely promote the progress of our respective countries.

The friendship between our two countries not only conforms to the interests of our two countries themselves, but also is required by the universal interests of international peace. The Nepalese people are a people who love freedom and peace. The Government of the Kingdom of Nepal pursues a policy conducive to peace. The just stand of the Government of the Kingdom of Nepal and the Nepalese people in supporting the Egyptian people's struggle against aggression also arouses our deep admiration. We regard Nepal as our close neighbor and friend in the cause of striving for peace. At a time when the forces of colonialism are once again posing a threat to the independence of Asian and African countries and the peace of the Asian-African region, it is necessary for our Asian and African countries to further strengthen unity with each other to defend the peace and security of this part of the world. We firmly believe that the development of friendship between China and Nepal based on the Five Principles will provide a good example for improving relations between countries.

Dear friends, in the past two months or so, I have visited nine countries in Asia and Europe. These countries have different political and social systems, and their people have different races, colors, beliefs, cultures, and histories. However, they all unanimously demand world peace, international friendship, and independent development of their own countries in a peaceful and friendly international environment. This personal experience makes us deeply believe that the cause of peace jointly pursued by China and Nepal is a cause supported by the broad masses of people around the world, and it is a cause that can certainly be victorious.

Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Hari Bhakta Shrestha for his enthusiastic words of praise for China, the Chinese people, and myself. I must say that all the achievements of New China should be attributed to the united efforts of the Chinese people, and I am but one of them. At the same time, if the Chinese people have made some achievements in the cause of revolution and construction, it is also inseparable from the support of the people of the world for us. We Chinese people will regard the Chairman's words as an spur to us, spurring us to unremittingly contribute all our strength to the cause of striving for world peace and promoting international friendship on the basis of the Five Principles.

As for the enthusiastic emotions that the Chairman and all Nepalese friends here today have shown us, then I can guarantee that we will convey it to the Chinese people, so that every one of them can receive your kindness as we do today.

As I am about to conclude my speech, I wish the friendship between China and Nepal to be as towering and everlasting as the Himalayas connecting our two countries, wish our two countries to advance side by side forever in the cause of safeguarding world peace and promoting international friendship, and wish that this friendship between our two countries can extend to all countries in Asia, Africa, and even the world that desire peace and friendship.

Long live the Five Principles!

Long live world peace!

Chin-Nepal-Maitri-Zindabad (Long live Sino-Nepalese friendship!)

Jai Nepal (Victory to Nepal!)

### 周恩来总理的讲话

1957-01-29

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅首相阁下，尊敬的哈里·布哈克塔·什雷斯塔主席先生，亲爱的尼泊尔朋友们：
    我衷心地感谢你们给我和我的同事们如此热烈的欢迎。言语无法表达我们在这里度过的时刻所给予我们的感动。从昨天在无数街道上欢迎我们的，以及今天在这个广场上同我们欢聚的千千万万人们的笑容和眼神中，我们看出了尼泊尔人民对中国人民的真诚的、深厚的友谊。而我们这次来的目的也正就是要把住在喜马拉雅山那一边的中国人民的友谊带给住在喜马拉雅山这一边的尼泊尔人民。现在，我以中国人民的名义，向你们，向全尼泊尔人民致亲切的问候和崇高的敬意。
    亲爱的朋友们：当我站在这个广场上，同千千万万的尼泊尔人民在一起的时候，过去时代的珍贵的回忆就又涌现在我的眼前。虽然在我们两国之间横亘着世界上最险阻的喜马拉雅山，然而我们的人民却自古以来就保持着友好的来往，他们交换了彼此在文化上的创造和在农业和工艺上的成就。在那些曾对发展中尼两国人民之间的友谊作了贡献的人们中间，法显、玄奘和阿尼哥留下了最辉煌的名字。这些名字已经成为策励我们继续不断加强中尼两国人民友谊的信号。
    近代以来，我们两国的关系也曾经有过比较停滞和黯淡的时期，西方殖民主义者在把他们的势力伸展到东方以后，曾经一再企图隔断我们之间的关系，并且在我们之间散播不和的种子。然而就是这样的时候，我们之间也一直保持着深厚的同情。要求恢复并且发展亚洲各国之间历史的联系和团结，一直是我们的共同理想。
    我们十分满意我们的这种理想现在已经得到了实现。亚洲以至整个东方现在开始了觉醒和复兴的伟大时代。1955年在万隆举行的第一次亚非会议响亮地宣布了亚非地区这十六万万人民要求促进国际友好和维护世界和平的强烈意志。正是在这个背景下，中国和尼泊尔之间古老的友谊不但已经恢复而且得到了新的发展。我们两国在建立外交关系的时候就明确宣布以中国和印度共同倡议的和平共处的五项原则——潘查希拉作为指导两国关系的基本原则。在这样一个新的、巩固的基础之上，我们顺利地解决了历史上遗留下来的两国关系上的各项问题，签订了“中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定”。它对发展我们两国之间的经济和文化联系开辟了广阔的道路。三个月以前，阿查里雅阁下作为历史上第一个尼泊尔首相访问了中国。这已经成为中国和尼泊尔关系发展史上一个重要的标志。现在，我们又来到尼泊尔，同广大的尼泊尔人民见面。我们深深感到，我们两国人民之间的友谊是在不断地增长。
    中国人民十分珍视同尼泊尔的友谊。我们两国人民都在努力建设我们各自的国家。中国人民一向认为国家无论大小，都是平等的，而且都各有自己的长处，值得其他国家学习。在历史上，尼泊尔曾经是中国的学者和匠师寻求知识和技术的地方；同样，中国的文化也曾经给过尼泊尔以影响。在今天，我们两国之间在建设事业中互相学习和互相帮助，也一定能促进我们各自的国家的进步。
    我们两国的友谊不但符合于我们两国本身的利益，而且也是国际和平的普遍利益所要求的。尼泊尔人民是爱好自由、爱好和平的人民。尼泊尔王国政府执行着有利于和平的政策。尼泊尔王国政府和尼泊尔人民支持埃及人民反侵略斗争的正义立场也引起我们的深深钦佩。我们把尼泊尔看成是我们在争取和平的事业中亲密的邻人和朋友。在这个殖民主义的势力又一次对亚非国家的独立和亚非地区的和平表现出威胁的时候，我们亚非国家有必要进一步加强彼此之间的团结，保卫世界这一部分的和平和安全。我们深信，中国和尼泊尔两国以五项原则为基础的友谊的发展将能对改善各国之间的关系提供良好的榜样。
    亲爱的朋友们，在过去的两个多月中间，我曾经访问了亚洲和欧洲的九个国家。这些国家的政治制度和社会制度是不同的，它们的人民的种族、肤色、信仰、文化、历史也是不同的，然而他们一致要求世界和平，要求国际友好，要求在一个和平友好的国际环境里独立地发展自己的国家。这种亲身的体验使我们深信，中国和尼泊尔所共同从事的和平事业是得到世界广大人民支持的事业，是一定可以胜利的事业。
    最后，我要谢谢哈里·布哈克塔·什雷斯塔主席先生对中国和中国人民和我本人所说的热情赞美的话。我必须说，新中国的一切成就都应当归功于中国人民团结一致的努力，而我不过是其中的一分子。同时，如果说中国人民在革命和建设事业中是有了一些成就的话，这也是同全世界人民对我们的支持分不开的。我们中国人民将把主席先生的这一番话看成是对我们的一种鞭策，鞭策我们永远不懈地在五项原则的基础上为争取世界和平和促进国际友好的事业贡献自己的一切力量。
    至于主席先生和今天在这里的全体尼泊尔朋友向我们所表现的如此热烈的情感，那末我可以保证，我们一定把它转达给中国人民，让他们每一个人都能同我们今天一样领受到你们的盛情。
    在我要结束我的讲话的时候，我祝中国和尼泊尔的友谊像连结着我们两国的喜马拉雅山那样巍然永存，祝我们两国在维护世界和平和促进国际友好的事业中永远并肩前进，祝我们两国间的这种友谊能够扩大到亚洲的、非洲的以至全世界一切愿意和平和友好的国家。
    五项原则万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    秦—尼泊尔—迈德里—津达巴（中尼友好万岁）！
    贾尼泊尔（尼泊尔胜利）！
