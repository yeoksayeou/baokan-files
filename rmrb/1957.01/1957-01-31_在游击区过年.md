Spending the New Year in the Guerrilla Zone
Xiao Yemu

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I spent eight "New Years" in the "Jin-Cha-Ji" area. Perhaps because the New Year only comes once a year, I remember the scenes of each New Year relatively clearly, especially those few "New Years" spent in the guerrilla zone.

If it wasn't 1942, then it was 1943. I was in the Fourth Military Subdistrict's Mass Drama Troupe. On New Year's Eve, some of our comrades from the troupe, carrying a large roll of "poetry leaflets" [Note 1], and carrying a bucket of lime for painting slogans and a bucket of red soil, followed the county guerrilla detachment, crossed the blockade trench, and arrived at the Huisher guerrilla zone in Ping Shan. The troops blockaded the enemy's blockhouses. We held a mass meeting in the "Great Township Office" to publicize the idea of "gritting our teeth, breaking through the darkness before dawn, and striving for the final victory of the War of Resistance." We also performed a living newspaper play. Afterwards, some people went to paint slogans, and others talked to the villagers.

I remember three things particularly clearly from that night.

First, there was a stack of account books in the "Great Township Office." Two of them were usually kept secret. One book recorded how many trees were sawed from whose house, whose wall was demolished, and how many bricks were taken away when the enemy built the blockhouses... It was all recorded clearly, stroke by stroke. The purpose of this book was so that one day when we demolished the blockhouses, we could return the items to their original owners. Another book recorded on what year, what month, and what day the enemy killed our people; on what year, what month, and what day, so-and-so from the blockhouse caught someone's chicken, and slapped someone's face... The purpose of this book was even more obvious. Through the mottled ink marks on those two books, we saw the blood and tears of the people, and also saw the people's indomitable will and belief in victory.

Second, the enemy's liaison officer (actually our inside man) told me that the enemy in the blockhouses were really wasting things. Yesterday, when they made New Year's dumplings, they first cooked a pot of rice. They fried the rice with eggs and minced meat to use as dumpling filling. After boiling the dumplings, they fried them in oil before dipping them in garlic and vinegar to eat. The enemy even asked him if he wanted to eat some. He said, "I wish I could bite them a few times!" I still remember the grinding of his teeth when he said that.

Third, before we left, the villagers collected fifteen pounds of meat to慰劳 (wèiláo) the troops. When we cut the meat back, we found several nails inserted in it. "Nails" was a euphemism for "blockhouses." Our soldiers naturally understood: to eat the meat, you must first pull out the "nails"! (I remember Comrade Kang Tuo also mentioned this in one of his articles.)

Dawn was breaking as we retreated. We encountered the enemy at the edge of the blockade trench. A battle broke out, and one soldier was injured. Two comrades from our drama troupe took turns carrying the wounded soldier to "Huobintai." By then, it was already dawn. It happened to be the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year. We ran into a Yangge dance team on the street, going to pay New Year's respects to the families of martyrs and soldiers. When they saw the wounded soldier, the gongs and drums suddenly went silent, and they stood silently on the side.

The two comrades who carried the wounded soldier had bloodstains on their jackets and pants. Even after washing, the stains remained. These two comrades wore those jackets and pants with bloodstains through several more harsh winters.

As for what we ate or drank that night, or even if we ate at all, I can't remember no matter how hard I try.

In the winter of 1944, I went to the Quyang guerrilla zone. After wandering around for half a month, I returned to the district on the evening of New Year's Eve to celebrate the New Year. That night happened to be the wedding of Xiao Liang, the director of the district's Armed Committee, and Xiao Ma, the propaganda committee member of the district's Women's Salvation Association. Two captured enemy phonographs were playing "wawila" in competition. Standing on the crossroads, you could also hear bursts of laughter coming from the district office. People were trying their best to joke with the newlyweds, and even when the three stars were slanting to the west, they still lingered in the bridal chamber. Suddenly, the district party secretary ran over and said to everyone that the enemy from the city had come out to loot grain, and told everyone to immediately disperse to various villages. At the same time, it was decided that the district guerrilla squad would set off immediately to cut off the enemy's retreat. At first, everyone thought that Lao Cao was using a "lure the tiger away from the mountain" scheme to let the bride and groom rest earlier. Who knew this was actually true. The groom was the director of the Armed Committee, and he insisted on going with the squad. Lao Cao was put in a difficult position, and after hesitating for a long time, he let him go. People hurriedly ran out of the bridal chamber, leaving a space for the newlyweds to say a few private words. After only a moment, he slung his Mauser pistol over his shoulder, hurried out, and followed the district squad.

Snow fell heavily just before dawn. On the first evening of the Lunar New Year, in Xiaozhuang, twelve li away from the city, the district squad, together with the guerrilla groups from the neighboring villages, blocked the enemy's retreat and recovered seven carts of grain.

On the morning of the second day of the Lunar New Year, the district squad returned. At the front they carried a stretcher. On the stretcher was none other than the groom. The bride silently walked to the stretcher, reached out to touch the groom's forehead, and returned to the bridal chamber to get a purple floral quilt [Note 2] that had just been washed and spread it over the groom's body. She slung her satchel over her shoulder, wrapped a white sheepskin towel around her head, and walked behind the stretcher, stepping on the snow that reached her ankles.

Everything seemed so sudden...

At noon, the messenger who went with the stretcher returned. People panicked at the sight of his face. It turned out that before the stretcher could even reach the rear hospital, our Comrade Xiao Liang had sacrificed himself...

Even now, when I think about these things, I still feel heavy-hearted. I wonder where Comrade Xiao Ma is now?

    在游击区过年
    萧也牧
    在抗日战争期间，我在“晋察冀”过了八个“年”。大约因为过年每年只过一次的缘故吧，在我的记忆里边，记得比较真切的，也就是每年过年的情景，尤其是在游击区过的那几个“年”。
    不是1942年就是1943年，我在四分区群众剧社。大年夜，我们剧社的一部分同志，带着一大卷“诗传单”〔注一〕，提着一桶刷标语的石灰和一桶红土，随着县游击大队，过了封锁沟，到了平山回舍游击区。部队封锁了敌人的炮楼。我们在“大乡公所”里召开群众大会，宣传“咬紧牙关，冲破黎明前的黑暗，争取抗战最后胜利”的道理。还演出了活报剧。过后，一批人去刷标语，一批人和乡亲们谈话。
    这一夜，我记得特别清楚的有三件事。
    第一件，“大乡公所”里有一叠帐本。里边有两本平时是秘而不宣的。有一本，记载着敌人盖炮楼的时候，锯了谁家的几棵树，拆了谁家的墙，拆走了多少块砖……一笔一笔记得清清楚楚。这本帐，为的是有一天我们拆了炮楼，以便物归原主。另一本，记载着哪年哪月哪日，敌人杀了我们的人；哪年哪月哪日，炮楼上的谁谁，逮了谁家的一只鸡，还打了谁的耳光……这本帐，用处就更明显了。透过那两本帐上斑斑的墨迹，我们看到了人民的血泪，也看到了人民不屈的意志和胜利的信念。
    第二件，敌人的联络员（其实是我们的内线）对我说，炮楼上的敌人真会糟蹋东西。昨天，他们包过年饺子，先煮了锅大米饭。用鸡蛋和肉末把饭炒了，当饺子馅。煮了饺子，又用油把饺子煎了，才蘸着蒜、醋吃。敌人还问他想吃不想吃？他说到这里，对我说：“我恨不得咬他们几口！”我还记得，他说这话时那咬牙切齿的神色。
    第三件，我们临走，乡亲们凑了十五斤肉慰劳部队。回来，切肉的时候，发现肉里插着几根钉子。“钉子”是“炮楼”的代称。我们的战士自然懂得：要吃肉先得把“钉子”拔掉！（记得康濯同志的一篇文章里，也提过这件事。）
    天将黎明，我们往回撤。到封锁沟边，和敌人遭遇了。打了一仗，有一位战士受了伤。我们剧社的两位同志，轮流着把这位受伤的战士背到“霍宾台”。那时候，天已经亮了。那正好是大年初一的早晨。街上碰见去给烈属、抗属拜年的秧歌队，他们见了这位受伤的战士，锣鼓顿时哑了，默默地在一边站着。
    我们那两位背伤员的同志，袄上，裤上，染了一片血。洗过以后，还留着痕迹。这两位同志，穿着那留着血迹的袄裤，又过了好几个严寒的冬天。
    至于那一夜我们吃了什么喝了什么，甚至到底吃了没有？我怎么想也想不起来了。
    1944年冬天，我到曲阳游击区去，转了半个月，除夕的傍晚回区里过年。那晚正好是区武委会主任小梁和区妇救会的宣传委员小马举行婚礼。两架缴获敌人的话匣子，“哇哩哇啦”唱着对台戏。站在十字街上，也能听见从区公所里传来阵阵的笑声。人们千方百计地和新夫妇开玩笑，一直闹到三星偏西，还是赖在洞房里不散。突然，区委书记跑来对大家说，城里的敌人出来抢粮了，让大家马上分散到各村去。同时决定区游击小队马上出发，去切断敌人的归路。开头，大家以为老曹使的是“调虎离山”计，好让新郎新娘早点休息。谁知道这竟是真的。新郎是武委会主任，硬要跟着小队出发。可把老曹难住了，迟疑半天，还是让他走了。人们赶忙从洞房里跑出来，留个空子，让他小两口说个体己话。才一会儿，他挎上盒子枪，匆匆地跑出来，跟上区小队走了。
    天快亮的时候，下了场大雪。初一的晚上，在离城十二里远的小庄子，区小队联合临近各村的游击小组卡住了敌人的归路，夺回了七大车的粮食。
    初二的早晨，区小队回来了。前面抬着副担架。谁知道担架上躺着的正是那位新郎。新娘默默地走到担架跟前，伸手摸摸新郎的前额，回到洞房里拿了条才拆洗过的紫花
  〔注二〕被子来，盖在新郎的身上。她挎上挎包，头上包了条白羊肚手巾，踩着齐脚背的积雪，跟在担架后边走了。
    一切都显得那样突然。……
    中午，随着担架去的通讯员回来了，人们一看他脸色，就着了慌。原来，担架还没抬到后方医院，我们的小梁同志牺牲了……
    直到如今，我想到这些事，心里还是觉得沉重。不知道小马同志现在在哪里？
