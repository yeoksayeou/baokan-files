    “Eisenhower Doctrine” is Naked Colonialism

    Despite the thick layer of cosmetics applied by the United States to the "Eisenhower Doctrine," it revealed its true colors as soon as it appeared. The "Eisenhower Doctrine's" colonialist plan has been fiercely criticized in the Middle East and throughout Asia and Africa, stirring up immense anger among millions of people. Even Dulles, the main architect of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," recently had to admit that "the Arab countries'" reaction to this plan was "not good."

    To promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine," Dulles and his ilk are shouting themselves hoarse about anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda. In the eyes of the United States, the war of aggression against Egypt launched by Britain and France not long ago seemed to pose no danger to the Middle Eastern countries, so it refused to join the Soviet Union in stopping the Anglo-French aggression. In the eyes of the United States, the current British armed attacks on Yemen and Israel's continued occupation of Egyptian territory seem to pose no danger to the Middle Eastern countries, so it simply ignores the Arab countries' appeals for support to Yemen while secretly supporting Israel. The United States is trying to make people believe that the only "danger" to the Middle Eastern countries is Soviet "aggression" (!), so it openly announced that the United States is prepared to use armed forces in the Middle East at any time, just as the flames of the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt had just died down. It is said that only in this way can "peace be created in the Middle East"!

    However, even Dulles himself admitted at a joint meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Military Committee that he could not find any evidence of a Soviet "threat" to the Middle East. So, who else is willing to listen to this anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric from the United States? As for the broad masses of Arab people, they know full well from real life who is truly supporting the independence and freedom of the Middle Eastern countries and who is threatening the independence and freedom of the Middle Eastern countries. On January 16, Egyptian President Nasser pointed out when meeting with the editor of the Greek "National Daily" that when Western countries refused to help Egypt, the Soviet Union truly helped Egypt, and therefore the Egyptian people warmly appreciate the Soviet Union. The statement issued by the Syrian government on January 10 also answered this question. This statement pointed out that there is no threat of international communism to Syria's security and independence. The root cause of the conflict in the Arab homeland and the possible threat of aggression to this region comes from imperialism!

    In fact, the anti-Soviet and anti-communist clamor of the United States is intended to cover up the real threat with a fabricated threat. The spearhead of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is mainly directed against the national independence movement in the Middle East. Its declared policy of "military deterrence" is intended to intimidate those Middle Eastern countries that insist on independence and freedom. So, why is the United States now adopting this "military deterrence" policy in the Middle East? Dulles said in a statement on Middle East policy issued on January 14: "The deterrent effect that some Western European countries may have has changed. Until recently, they provided significant deterrence to prevent the Communists from carrying out aggression in the Middle East. However, for several reasons (!), this force can no longer meet the current needs." The real meaning of this passage is that in the past, the main force suppressing the national independence movement in the Middle East was the British and French colonialists, but due to the failure of the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt, the main role in suppressing the national independence movement in the Middle East must now be taken over by the United States. Dulles, like Eden, calls the use of "deterrent force" by colonial countries against Middle Eastern countries that insist on independence and freedom preventing Communist "aggression," preventing the Soviet Union from establishing "satellite states" in the Middle East. Therefore, according to this logic, any Middle Eastern country, as long as it insists on independence and freedom, the United States can use anti-Soviet and anti-communist pretexts to carry out armed intervention.

    In addition to the "military deterrence" policy, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" also includes a plan to exercise military control over the Middle Eastern countries. Dulles recently claimed that in order to "protect" the "independence" of the Middle Eastern countries, the United States is prepared to help these countries establish "security forces." However, this approach is not new to the Middle Eastern countries. The Middle Eastern countries have had painful experiences. They know that allowing Western colonial countries to control their troops is tantamount to letting others control their fate. The "Arab Legion" established and commanded by British General Glubb is an example. Now, the "Eisenhower Doctrine's" plan even wants to impose American-style "Glubb Generals" on the Middle Eastern countries!

    Similarly, the economic "aid" plan of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is also a lever for manipulating the Middle Eastern countries. Dulles recently openly said that American "aid" is conditional, that is, the recipient countries "must be committed to the struggle against international communism." In other words, these countries must abandon their policy of peace and neutrality. But who will benefit from doing so? The Syrian "Al-Ayyam" is right: the purpose of American "aid" is to make Arab countries "abandon their active policy of neutrality, and their relations with the Soviet Union deteriorate, which is contrary to the national interests of these countries and the policies they implement." It can be seen that American "aid" is to exchange the national interests of the Arab countries for dollars. American monopoly capital groups have extracted astronomical figures of profit from the Middle East. The appropriation stipulated by the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is only a fraction of these huge profits, but it wants to use this fraction to buy the most precious sovereignty and freedom of the Arab people, and then extract even greater profits... What a charitable heart!

    It is precisely because the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is completely an American-style colonialist plan that it is not only resisted by the people of the Middle East, but also aroused uneasiness among Britain and France. British and French officials have outwardly expressed "welcome" to the "Eisenhower Doctrine." However, this is just a "forced smile." Although Britain and France and the United States are united in suppressing and intimidating the national independence movement, Britain and France still cannot help but discover that their colonial positions in the Middle East are being taken away by the United States, and more oil is flowing into the American oil barrels.

    The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is thus aggressively attempting to replace Britain and France, with the United States dominating the Middle East. But its fate will not be better than British and French colonialism. The Middle East is not a "power vacuum." Millions of awakened people live there, who are determined to be the masters of their own countries and do not want any imperialism to "fill" and "protect" them. It is the strength of the Middle Eastern people that has struck down the Truman Doctrine's aggressive plan and shattered the American conspiracy to establish a "Middle East Command." It is the strength of the Middle Eastern people that has carried out a heroic struggle against the enslaving Baghdad Pact, turning it into a stranded wreck. It is the strength of the Middle Eastern people that has defeated the Anglo-French aggressors. The Middle Eastern people oppose British and French colonialism, and they also oppose American colonialism. They will fight to defeat the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Only in this way can the independence and freedom of the Middle Eastern countries be safeguarded, and the peace and security of the Middle East be consolidated.

### “艾森豪威尔主义”是露骨的殖民主义

    “艾森豪威尔主义”是露骨的殖民主义
    尽管美国给“艾森豪威尔主义”涂上了一层很厚的脂粉，但是它刚一出场就现了原形。“艾森豪威尔主义”的殖民主义计划在中东和整个亚非地区遭到了猛烈的抨击，激起了千百万人民的极大愤怒。最近连“艾森豪威尔主义”的主要策划人杜勒斯，也不得不承认，“各阿拉伯国家”对这个计划的反应是“不好的”。
    为了推销“艾森豪威尔主义”，杜勒斯之流正在力竭声嘶地叫嚣反苏反共。在美国看来，不久以前英法发动侵略埃及的战争，似乎对中东国家并没有什么危险，所以它拒绝同苏联一起制止英法侵略。在美国看来，现在英国武装进攻也门，以色列仍然占据埃及领土，似乎对中东国家也没有什么危险，所以它根本不理会阿拉伯国家要求支援也门的呼吁，同时还在背后支持以色列。美国企图使人相信，对中东国家的唯一“危险”就是苏联的“侵略”（！），于是它在英法侵略埃及的战火刚刚熄灭的时候，公然宣布美国准备随时在中东使用武装部队。据说，只有这样，才能“缔造中东的和平”！
    但是，甚至杜勒斯本人在美国参议院外交委员会和军事委员会联席会议上也承认，他并找不出苏联“威胁”中东的证据来。那么，美国的这种反苏反共的滥调，还有什么人愿意听呢？至于广大的阿拉伯人民，他们从现实生活中完全知道，谁是真正支持中东国家独立自由的，而谁是威胁中东国家独立自由的。1月16日埃及总统纳赛尔在接见希腊“民族日报”编辑时就指出，当西方国家拒绝帮助埃及的时候，苏联真正帮助了埃及，因此埃及人民热烈感激苏联。1月10日叙利亚政府发表的声明也回答了这个问题。这个声明指出，对叙利亚的安全和独立并不存在什么国际共产主义的威胁。而在阿拉伯国土上发生冲突的根源，以及对这个地区可能产生的侵略威胁，都是来自帝国主义方面的！
    实际上，美国的反苏反共叫嚣就是想用虚构的威胁来掩护真正的威胁。“艾森豪威尔主义”的矛头主要是针对中东民族独立运动的。它所宣布的“军事威慑”政策就是想恫吓那些坚持独立自由的中东国家。那么，为什么现在美国要在中东采取这种“军事威慑”政策呢？杜勒斯在1月14日发表的关于中东政策的声明中说：“某些西欧国家可能起的威慑作用有了改变。最近以前，它们为了使共产党不敢在中东进行侵略提供了重大的威慑力量。但是，由于若干原因（！）这种力量再不能应付目前的需要了。”这段话的真正意思就是说，过去镇压中东民族独立运动的主要力量是英法殖民者，但是，由于英法侵略埃及的失败，现在这个镇压中东民族独立运动的主要角色不能不由美国来担当了。杜勒斯同艾登一样，把殖民国家对坚持独立自由的中东国家使用“威慑力量”叫做防止共产党“侵略”，叫做防止苏联在中东建立“卫星国”。因此，按照这种逻辑，任何一个中东国家只要它坚持独立自由，美国就可以借口反苏反共而进行武装干涉。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”除了包括“军事威慑”政策以外，还包括一个对中东国家进行军事控制的计划。杜勒斯最近声称，为了“保护”中东国家的“独立”，美国准备帮助这些国家建立“保安部队”。可是，这种做法，对中东国家说来，实在是不太新鲜了。中东国家有过痛苦的经历。他们知道，让西方殖民国家控制自己的部队，就无异于让别人控制自己的命运。曾经由英国格拉布将军建立和指挥的“阿拉伯军团”就是例子。现在，“艾森豪威尔主义”的计划竟想把美国式的“格拉布将军”强加到中东国家的头上！
    同样的，“艾森豪威尔主义”的经济“援助”计划也是一个操纵中东国家的杠杆。杜勒斯最近公开说，美国的“援助”是有条件的，就是受援国“必须致力于反对国际共产主义的斗争”。换句话说，就是这些国家必须放弃和平中立的政策。但是，这样做究竟对谁有利呢？叙利亚“旷野报”说得对：美国“援助”的目的是要阿拉伯国家“放弃积极的中立政策，同苏联的关系恶化，而这是同这些国家的民族利益以及它们所执行的政策相违背的。”可见，美国的“援助”就是要用美元来换取阿拉伯国家的民族利益。美国垄断资本集团从中东榨取了天文学数字的利润，“艾森豪威尔主义”所规定的一笔拨款只是这些巨大利润的一个零头，然而它却想用这个零头来收买阿拉伯人民最珍贵的主权和自由，然后再来榨取更巨大的利润……好一付慈善心肠啊！
    正是因为“艾森豪威尔主义”完全是一套美国式的殖民主义计划，所以它不但遭到中东人民的反抗，而且也引起英法的不安。英法官方表面上对“艾森豪威尔主义”表示了“欢迎”。然而，这不过是“强颜欢笑”。虽然英法和美国在镇压和恫吓民族独立运动方面是一致的，但是英法仍然不能不发现，它们在中东的殖民阵地正被美国抢去，更多的石油流进了美国的油桶。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”就是这样咄咄逼人地企图代替英法，由美国独霸中东。但是它的命运决不会比英法殖民主义好些。中东不是什么“力量真空”。那里生活着千百万觉醒了的人民，他们决心要做自己国家的主人，而不要任何帝国主义来“填补”和“保护”。正是中东人民的力量，打击了杜鲁门主义的侵略计划，粉碎了美国建立“中东司令部”的阴谋。正是中东人民的力量，同奴役性的巴格达条约进行了英勇斗争，使它成了一只搁浅的破船。正是中东人民的力量，打败了英法侵略者。中东人民反对英法殖民主义，同样也反对美国殖民主义。他们将为打败“艾森豪威尔主义”而斗争。只有这样，才能维护中东国家的独立自由，才能巩固中东的和平与安全。
