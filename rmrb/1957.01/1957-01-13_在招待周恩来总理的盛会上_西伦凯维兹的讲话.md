    At the Grand Reception for Premier Zhou Enlai
    Cyrankiewicz's Speech
    Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai, Respected Comrade He Long, Respected Members of the Delegation:
    On behalf of the government of the Polish People's Republic, I extend my most sincere welcome to all the guests attending this reception held for the visit of the government delegation of the People's Republic of China to Poland. The Polish People's Republic and the People's Republic of China are linked by unbreakable bonds of friendship, a friendship built on common ideals, on common efforts to build a better new life, and on a common struggle for peace. Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai said today that the distance of thousands of miles separating our two countries geographically is not decisive, and he is right. Because geographical distance is indeed without decisive significance. What is decisive is mutual understanding, mutual trust, the absence of prejudice, and the common future of the struggle for socialism.
    Since the founding of People's China, we have given each other as much support as possible in political affairs and in the common demands of our two countries on the international stage. Throughout this period, Poland, along with a number of other countries, has steadfastly defended the right of People's China to become a member of the United Nations organization in order to ease international tensions. Our relations in the economic and cultural fields have developed smoothly, benefiting both our countries. These relations are constantly developing in a fraternal atmosphere, which is manifested in mutual understanding, equality, respect for each other's national interests, and mutual assistance in building socialism and consolidating our national independence. We know that when we develop our relations on such principles, we are helping to unite all socialist countries more closely and helping to consolidate all socialist countries.
    The Polish People's Republic fully recognizes the great international significance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    Poland also recognizes the principle of peaceful cooperation between all countries regardless of social and political systems, the principle of resolving disputes through consultation, and the principle of opposing the conspiracies of imperialist blocs. The imperialist blocs are trying to revive the Cold War and even launch aggression, as they have done recently in the Middle East.
    But we are convinced that the united efforts of all peace-loving forces, especially the firm peaceful stance and policies adopted by the Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp, will eliminate all obstacles and reverse the trend of events, leading it towards reconciliation and amity among nations.
    Dear guests, the Polish government is determined to further strengthen the friendly relations with People's China and develop fraternal relations with it, for the benefit of our two countries, for the benefit of socialism, and for the cause of peace. We are pleased that your position in Asia and the world has been enhanced and your national prestige has been enhanced.
    During your visit, you will become familiar with our country's situation, the socialist construction in Poland, our achievements, difficulties, and transformations. Your visit will help to enhance mutual understanding and understanding. Today, on the first day of your visit, I can already say that our talks are being conducted in a truly harmonious and friendly atmosphere, full of complete mutual understanding.
    I wish our guests an extremely pleasant and fruitful stay in Poland. I propose:
    To the health of the head of the delegation, Premier Zhou Enlai, to the health of Vice Premier He Long, to the health of the members of the delegation, to the smooth development of the great People's State and our true friend, the People's Republic of China,
    Cheers.
    Long live our guests!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    在招待周恩来总理的盛会上
    西伦凯维兹的讲话敬爱的周恩来同志，敬爱的贺龙同志，敬爱的代表团团员们：
    我代表波兰人民共和国政府，向参加为中华人民共和国政府代表团访问波兰而举行的这次招待会的所有客人们表示最诚挚的欢迎。波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间有牢不可破的友谊的纽带联系着，这种友谊建立在共同的理想上，建立在为建设美好的新生活而进行的共同努力上，建立在争取和平的共同斗争上。周恩来总理同志今天说，我们两国在地理上相隔千万里的距离并没有决定意义，他这话说得很对。因为地理上的距离确实是毫无决定意义的，具有决定意义的是相互的谅解，相互的信任，不怀成见和争取社会主义的斗争的共同前途。
    自从人民中国成立以来，我们就在政治事务方面，在我们两国在国际舞台上的共同要求方面，互相给予尽可能大的支持。在整个这一时期中，波兰一直是同其他一些国家一起，坚持不渝地为了缓和国际紧张局势而维护人民中国成为联合国组织成员的权利。我们在经济、文化方面的关系得到了顺利的发展，使我们两国都得到了好处。这些关系正在一种兄弟般的气氛中不断发展，这种气氛表现在互相谅解、平等、尊重彼此的民族利益、以及在建设社会主义和巩固我们的国家独立中互相援助。我们知道，当我们根据这样的原则发展我们的关系的时候，我们是在帮助使一切社会主义国家更加紧密地团结起来，也是在帮助巩固一切社会主义国家。
    波兰人民共和国充分认识到和平共处五项原则的重大国际意义。
    波兰也承认一切国家不分社会和政治制度进行和平合作的原则，承认通过协商解决争执问题的原则和反对帝国主义集团的阴谋的原则。帝国主义集团正在努力恢复冷战，甚至发动侵略，像他们最近在中东所作的那样。
    但是，我们确信，一切爱好和平力量联合一致的努力，首先是苏联、中国和整个社会主义阵营所采取的坚决的和平立场和它们所采取的政策，将会排除一切障碍，扭转事态发展的趋势而使它走向各国之间的和解和亲善。
    亲爱的客人们，波兰政府决心进一步加强同人民中国的友好关系和发展同它的兄弟关系，这是为了我们两国的利益，为了社会主义的利益，为了和平的事业。你们在亚洲和全世界的地位已经提高，你们的国家威信已经提高，这使我们感到高兴。
    你们在访问中将要熟悉我国的情况，熟悉波兰的社会主义建设，熟悉我们的成就、困难和转变。你们的访问将会有助于增进相互的认识和了解。今天，在你们的访问的第一天，我就已经可以说，我们的会谈是在真正融洽的友好气氛中进行的，这种气氛充满了完全的相互谅解。
    预祝我们的客人们在逗留波兰期间极其愉快，并且获得极其丰富的成果。我建议：
    为代表团团长周恩来总理的健康，为贺龙副总理的健康，为代表团团员的健康，为伟大的人民国家和我们真正的朋友中华人民共和国的顺利发展，
    干杯。
    我们的客人们万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
