    Utilizing Waste Materials and Substitutes
    Currently, a shortage of some raw materials in China's industry and construction has become one of the urgent problems needing resolution. Can this problem be solved? The answer is a definite yes.
    Many facts prove that China has many available waste materials and substitutes, and the scope for using them is also very broad. Some things that were previously considered waste can now be used as raw materials for production or materials for capital construction. Some raw materials that were previously thought to be necessarily imported from abroad can now be replaced by domestic products. Some products that were previously thought to require the use of steel or non-ferrous metals can now be replaced by wood, plastics, or even ceramics. For example, blast furnace slag from iron smelting has always been used as waste for paving roads and filling pits. Cement plants in Fushun, Benxi, and other places used it to replace clay as a raw material for cement manufacturing. From May and June of last year to December of last year, they used a total of more than 198,000 tons of blast furnace slag, increasing cement production by more than 97,000 tons. Carbon black used in the rubber industry was previously imported from abroad. Last year, after partially switching to carbon black made from crude anthracene, a by-product of coking in Fushun and other places, more than one million yuan in funds could be saved in one quarter. The local state-owned Shaoyang Paper Mill uses bamboo hemp silk as 60% of its raw material for manufacturing coated paper. Due to the shortage of this raw material, they switched to using bamboo tips and green bamboo skin discarded by farmers, which not only overcame the difficulty of insufficient raw materials but also reduced costs by three-quarters and increased farmers' income. Members of the Shanghai Handicraft Production Cooperatives used rags, rotten cotton, waste nail heads, and old iron scraps picked up from garbage dumps to manufacture many kinds of daily necessities. More than 40 factories in Shanghai that manufacture shoe buckles used to rely on imports for raw materials. Now, by switching to using scrap iron from enamel factories, they can save 600,000 yuan in foreign exchange each year. Similar examples abound in various industrial production and capital construction projects.
    In order to fully utilize waste materials and substitutes, we should develop the organic synthetic chemical industry and pay attention to the comprehensive utilization of resources in industrial construction. Many wastes that are usually considered useless, or of little use, can be manufactured into extremely useful industrial products for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives after being treated by organic synthetic chemical methods. For example, petroleum waste gas can be used to make synthetic alcohol, which can not only save a large amount of grain, but its cost is also a quarter cheaper than alcohol made from grain. It can also manufacture a series of useful items such as synthetic rubber and plastics. Coking gas from coking can be used to make chemical fertilizers. These things are often discarded as waste. In some industrially advanced countries, more and more metal products have been replaced by plastic products. Similarly, in the textile industry, China currently uses almost entirely cotton, silk, wool, and hemp as raw materials. However, in many countries, artificial fibers have long been used to produce rayon, artificial cotton, and artificial wool. Various fabrics made of artificial fibers are not only beautiful in appearance but also strong and durable. Some properties of artificial fibers are even unattainable by cotton, wool, silk, and hemp. At present, China's organic synthetic chemical industry and the comprehensive utilization of resources have gradually attracted everyone's attention. We must make plans in this regard and gradually implement them in order to more effectively utilize our resources.
    The benefits of utilizing waste materials and substitutes are easy to understand in theory, but in practice, not everyone truly understands this. Some business departments and leaders of some industrial and mining enterprises often regard the utilization of waste materials and substitutes as trivial matters, believing that they cannot solve major problems. They do not pay attention to this measure, nor do they seriously promote effective advanced experience in this area. Some production workers believe that their task is to manage production, and that the utilization of waste materials and substitutes is not their business. They use whatever they have, and saving or not saving is irrelevant to them. Some design workers often only care about designing the drawings and consider their work done, while rarely considering, or not considering at all, what materials are most economical to use. Some material supply workers believe that the materials to be used are all stipulated by the higher authorities, and they give whatever is requested and buy whatever is lacking. If these erroneous ideas are not changed, they will inevitably affect the utilization of waste materials and substitutes. We hope that industrial and construction departments will take action simultaneously in every link of planning, design, raw material supply, processing, or construction, and scientific research, and pay close attention to the utilization of waste materials and substitutes.
    Of course, the utilization of waste materials and substitutes must be carried out under the premise of ensuring quality. Before adopting any substitutes or waste materials that have not been scientifically tested or proven to be usable in practice, they should be carefully studied and tested. Some important products, important projects, or products and projects that use a large number of waste materials and substitutes should be repeatedly tested and appraised to prove that they are reliable and that the product quality is guaranteed before they can be utilized or promoted. Hasty actions must never be taken. Otherwise, not only will the goal of increasing production and saving not be achieved, but it will also cause harm to the country's construction cause.
    It is entirely foreseeable that some specific difficulties will be encountered in the process of utilizing waste materials and substitutes. For example, changes in raw materials may lead to more time spent on operations, and so on. This requires relevant leading departments to adopt corresponding measures in a spirit of seeking truth from facts and solve them in a timely manner. Units or individuals that have made achievements in the utilization of waste materials and substitutes should be given material rewards. While utilizing waste materials and substitutes, attention should also be paid to completing the task of handing in waste products for recycling.
    It should be recognized that a piece of rag, an ounce of waste cotton, a pinch of sawdust, a piece of waste paper, a nail head, and a piece of old rope can all be turned into extremely useful things for our production and life after processing. In order to help our industrial and mining enterprises better utilize the country's resources, everyone has a responsibility to provide relevant departments with information on waste materials and substitutes, and to urge relevant departments to make better use of them.

    利用废料和代用品
    目前我国工业和建筑业中有一部分原材料不足，这已成为工业和建筑业中急需解决的问题之一。这个问题能不能够解决呢？可以肯定地回答：能够解决。
    许多事实证明，我国可以利用的废料和代用品是很多的，可能使用废料和代用品的范围也是很广的。有些东西，过去认为是废物，现在却可以把它作为生产原料或基本建设中的材料使用了。有些原材料，过去认为必须从国外进口，现在在国内也能找到代替品了。有些产品，过去认为必须使用钢铁或者有色金属制造，现在可以用木材、塑料、甚至陶器代替了。比如炼过铁的高炉矿渣，过去一向都是把它当作废物用去铺路、填坑的。抚顺、本溪等水泥厂把它用来代替粘土作为制造水泥的原料，从去年五、六月份起，到去年12月份，共用高炉矿渣十九万八千多吨，约增产水泥九万七千多吨。橡胶工业中用的炭黑，过去都是从国外进口，去年部分改用抚顺等地炼焦副产品粗蒽制造的炭黑以后，一个季度就能节约一百多万元的资金。地方国营邵阳造纸厂，制造胶板纸的原料60％是竹麻丝。由于这种原料不足，他们改用被农民丢弃的竹尖子、竹青皮，不仅克服了原料不足的困难，而且使成本降低四分之三，也使农民增加了收入。上海手工业生产合作社的社员们利用从垃圾堆里拣出来的破布、烂棉花、废钉头、旧铁片等制造出很多种类日常生活用品。上海有四十多家制造鞋扣的厂坊，过去用的原料，一向都靠国外进口，现在改用搪瓷厂的下脚铁皮，一年就能节约六十万元的外汇。类似这样的事例，在各种工业生产和基本建设工程中还有很多。
    为了充分利用废料和代用品，我们应该发展有机合成化学工业，并且在工业建设中注意资源的综合利用。有许多平常认为没有用处的废物，或用处不大的东西，经过有机合成化学方法处理之后，可以制造成工农业生产和人民生活上极其有用的工业品。例如石油废气，可以用来制成人造酒精，不仅可以节约大量的粮食，它的成本比用粮食作的酒精还要便宜四分之一。它还可以制造合成橡胶塑料等一系列有用的物品。炼焦的焦炉气，可以用来制成化学肥料。而这些东西往往是被当作废物丢掉的。在一些工业先进的国家里，已经有愈来愈多的金属制品改由塑料制品来代替。同样，在纺织业方面，我国目前差不多全部是用棉花、丝、羊毛和麻作原料。可是，在不少国家里，早已采用人造纤维生产人造丝、人造棉、人造毛。用人造纤维制成的各种织物，不仅外形美观，而且坚固耐用。人造纤维的某些特性甚至是棉花、羊毛、丝、麻所不能有的。目前我国有机合成化学工业和资源的综合利用已经逐渐引起了大家的重视，我们必须在这方面作出规划，逐步推行，以便更有效地利用我们的资源。
    利用废料和代用品的好处说起来容易懂得，但是，从实践中看，这还不是所有的人都真正懂得的。有些业务主管部门和部分工矿企业的领导人员，往往把利用废料和代用品看成是鸡毛蒜皮的小事，认为解决不了大问题。他们不重视这种措施，也没有认真地把这方面行之有效的先进经验加以推广。有些生产工作人员认为：我的任务是管生产的，利用废料和代用品不是我的事，有什么我就用什么，节约不节约与我无关。有些设计工作人员，往往只管把图纸设计出来，就算完事，而对于用什么材料最节约就很少考虑，或者根本不考虑。有些材料供应工作人员认为：用什么材料都是上级规定好了的，要什么我就给什么，缺什么我就买什么。这些错误思想如果不改变，就必然会影响废料和代用品的利用。我们希望工业和建筑业部门，在编制计划、设计、原材料供应、加工或施工的每个环节和科学研究方面都同时动作起来，切实注意利用废料和代用品。
    当然，利用废料和代用品必须在保证质量的前提下进行。凡是没有经过科学试验或实践证明可用的代用品或废料、废物，在采用之前，都应该认真地加以研究和试验。有些重要产品、重要工程，或利用废料和代用品数量较大的产品和工程，应该经过反复试验和鉴定，证明确有把握，对产品质量确有保证，然后才能利用或推广，决不可草率从事。否则不但不能达到增产节约的目的，反会给国家建设事业带来危害。
    完全可以预料，在利用废料和代用品的过程中，还会遇到一些具体困难。比如由于原材料的变更，可能使操作上花费的时间更多，等等。这都要求有关领导部门本着实事求是的精神，采取相应的措施，及时地给以解决。对于利用废料和代用品有成绩的单位或个人应给以物质奖励。在利用废料和代用品的同时，还应该注意完成废品回收的上交任务。
    应当认识，一块破布、一两废棉、一撮木屑、一张废纸、一节钉头、一段旧绳头，只要经过加工处理，都能变成我们生产上和生活上极其有用的东西。为了帮助我们的工矿企业更好地利用国家的资源，我们每个人都有责任，向有关部门提供废料和代用品的资源情况，督促有关部门更好地加以利用。
