Xinhua News Agency, January 21st Dispatch from Washington: According to Agence France-Presse, senior American officials are considering whether Britain's participation in the Middle East's "defense" is necessary.

These senior officials expressed doubts as to whether Britain's continued participation in the Baghdad Pact is in the "interests of the United States and the entire free world." American Middle East experts have concluded that Britain's participation in the Middle East's "defense" is "more harmful than beneficial" to the United States.

Washington diplomatic observers believe that Britain's request to join the Baghdad Pact may be mainly to maintain its position in Iraq. However, American influence is increasingly felt there as well. The Iraqi army, which until recently could only obtain British military supplies, is now receiving increasing amounts of American supplies.

Currently, the United States is exerting influence on Middle Eastern leaders by inviting them to visit the United States. Agence France-Presse reports that as British influence in the Middle East declines day by day, American experts are expecting Middle Eastern countries to turn to the United States.

    美国独霸中东的野心勃勃
    打算把英国踢出巴格达集团
    新华社21日讯　据法新社华盛顿消息：美国高级官员正在考虑要不要英国参加中东地区的“防务”问题。
    这些高级官员们对于英国继续参加巴格达条约是否符合“美国和整个自由世界的利益”，表示怀疑。美国的中东问题专家断定，英国参加中东地区的“防务”对美国是“弊多利少”的。
    华盛顿外交观察家们认为，英国要求参加巴格达条约可能主要是想保持在伊拉克的地位。可是那里也愈来愈感到美国的势力，在最近以前只能得到英国军事物资的伊拉克军队，现在正在得到数量愈来愈大的美国物资。
    目前，美国正在通过邀请中东国家领导人员访问美国的办法，对他们施加影响。法新社消息指出，当英国势力在中东一天比一天衰落的时候，美国专家们正在期待着中东国家转向美国。
