    Helping Mountain Areas Develop Fish Farming

    Since agricultural cooperativization, the Yimeng Mountains in Shandong Province have built more than 2,000 reservoirs, capable of storing 50 million cubic meters of water. The vast number of farmers, looking at the sea-like reservoirs they built themselves and the bumper harvests, are all overjoyed, further inspiring their enthusiasm for building the mountainous areas. Currently, farmers universally demand to develop freshwater fish farming in the reservoirs, and request help in solving the problems of fish fry and technology. For example, Mengyin County has 113 reservoirs and ponds, and more than a hundred agricultural cooperatives in the county are constantly sending people or writing letters to the county party committee requesting help in solving the problems of fish fry and fish farming technology. At the same time, many counties in this region have also sent people to the special commissioner's office and the province to request solutions to this problem, but it has not been resolved to this day.

    Judging from the current situation, if all these reservoirs in the Yimeng area are used for fish farming, the prospects for development are very great. For example, the fish raised in the Taiping Guanzhuang Village Reservoir in Gezhuang District, Yishui County, can grow to two or three catties of carp in one year. If all the reservoirs were used for fish farming, it would not only solve the problem that it is difficult for farmers in mountainous areas to eat fresh fish all year round, but also increase farmers' income. Therefore, it is recommended that the aquatic products department strengthen its leadership in the development of fish farming in mountainous areas, and quickly solve the problems of fish fry supply and technical guidance.

    帮助山区发展养鱼业
    山东省的沂蒙山区，自从农业合作化后，已经修建水库二千多座，可以蓄水五千万立方。广大农民看着他们自己修建的大海似的水库和丰收的庄稼，都欢欣鼓舞，更加激发了他们建设山区的积极性。当前农民普遍要求在水库里发展淡水养鱼事业，要求帮助他们解决鱼苗和技术问题。如蒙阴县有一百一十三座水库塘坝，县里的百余个农业社，不断地派人或写信向县委要求帮助他们解决鱼苗和养鱼技术问题。同时这个地区的许多县也曾派人到专署和省里要求解决这个问题，至今也没有得到解决。
    根据现在情况看，沂蒙地区的这些水库如果都养鱼，发展前途是很大的。如沂水县葛庄区太平官庄村水库养的鱼，一年一条鲤鱼可以长两三斤。假若所有的水库都养鱼，不仅能解决山区农民终年很难吃到鲜鱼的问题，而且也能增加农民的收入。因此，建议水产部门加强对山区发展养鱼事业的领导，迅速解决鱼苗供应和技术指导的问题。
