    The Quality and Planning of Books
    Yan Hao
    Publishing houses should have plans for publishing books, because plans are the concretization of principles. We cannot imagine that any publishing house can do without principles; or that even if it has so-called principles, it does not have a selection of topics and a plan to realize them. Every publishing house has its own task of propaganda and education, and it is also an enterprise. In either respect, its work cannot be unplanned.
    However, the foundation of book production is mental labor, and using one's brain is, after all, different from operating a machine. It is unacceptable to equate the planning of writing and editing books with industrial production plans.
    However, in the process of implementing planning in our publishing industry, some practices, such as mechanically applying the requirement that "the plan is the law," emphasizing that all topics for each year's manuscripts and publications must be listed, and striving to achieve more than 90% realization, are precisely committing the mistake of not distinguishing between different things. The result of subjectivism is, first, hitting a wall. Over the years, the books actually published by many publishing houses have undergone "drastic changes" compared to the original topic selection plans. Second, it has created a bad consequence. Because the plan requires too much and is too rigid, it makes the editors, while also shouting slogans to improve quality, often compromise on quality in order not to change the topic selection and delay the publication period under the pressure of percentages. Some editorial departments have even had to buy "green seedlings" everywhere, hastily accepting rush-made semi-finished products, and hastily issuing manuscripts that have been clipped and pasted. They adopt the "assembly line method" for intensive processing of book manuscripts that still need careful revision by the author. What about quality requirements? Under this approach, how can it not become secondary and then even less important! Some editorial departments are therefore unwilling to handle manuscripts outside the topic selection, because even if there are good books, they will still be regarded as "outside the plan," and the statistics table will still be unsightly.
    The implementation of planning in the editorial work of publishing houses originally has a good effect on improving the quality of books, especially in strengthening the purposefulness of publications and meeting the needs of the masses. However, once the requirements are too high, too strict, and too rigid, and deviate from the characteristics of writing and editing as mental labor, it will in turn be harmful to improving the quality of books, and even encourage some authors to adopt an unserious style in writing, which is also detrimental to the contention of a hundred schools of thought.
    Now it seems that this planning method needs to be changed.
    The most important thing here is to separate the topic selection and editing work plan from the book publishing plan. Although the former two prescribe the direction and time requirements of the work, which must be followed, it can only be regarded as a goal to be achieved, and more changes should be allowed. Because any topic selection, even if there is an author and a contract, there are still a series of situations that cannot be calculated in advance, such as the smoothness or difficulty of completion, the high or low quality after writing, the complexity or simplicity of the handling work, and so on.
    The latter should be a production plan with full reality and should be included in the national economic plan. It cannot take the former's topic selection as the topic selection, but can only be based on manuscripts that have been reviewed and are available and have been reliably commissioned and are confident of being published. Its changes can then be minimized. The topic selection can have long-term and annual listing plans, in order to reflect the clear and specific goals to be achieved in the principles. Although the book publishing also has an annual plan, it should not mechanically stipulate the percentage of topic selections. It is only necessary to propose the aspects of book publishing, the overall indicators, and the category proportions. It can only be fully listed in the quarterly plan, and then completely fixed in the monthly plan. It is the result of the author and editor completing and doing a good job, rather than a contract for a half-cooked meal. In this way, the phenomenon of putting the cart before the horse can be corrected.
    In the future, the evaluation of a publishing house's achievements should also focus on the overall aspect, looking at what books it has published, especially whether the books are well published, and should not be too concerned about whether certain individual topic selections have been realized, always measuring with percentages and looking at problems in a formalistic way.
    The quality of books is of course not entirely due to this, but it is indeed quite related to what has been said above. Moreover, over the years, our publishing work has implemented planning, and everyone has seen the benefits. However, among these, which practices are correct, and which have problems and need to be changed in order to further promote the work, is worth thinking about again.

    书籍的质量和计划
    颜浩
    出版社出书，应当有计划。因为计划就是方针的具体化。我们不能设想，任何一个出版社可以不要方针；或者虽有所谓方针，而没有选题和实现它的规划。每个出版社都有自己的宣传教育任务，而且又是个企业，无论从哪方面讲，它的工作都不能是无计划的。
    但是书籍生产的基础是脑力劳动，开动脑筋和开动机器毕竟是两回事。把写书、编书的计划和工业生产计划等同看待，都是要不得的。
    可是，我们的出版事业，在实行计划化当中，有些做法，比如：搬用“计划即法律”的机械要求，强调每年发稿出书要全部列题，要争取90％以上实现等等，恰恰犯了对不同事物不加分别对待的毛病。主观主义的结果，第一是碰壁，许多出版社历年实际出的书，对原订选题计划讲来，没有不是“面目大变”的。第二是产生了一个恶果，因为计划要求过高、过死，就使得编辑工作中虽然也高呼提高质量，但事实上，在百分比压力下，却常常为不变动选题不耽误发稿期而在质量上迁就。有的编辑部并因而不得不四出购买“青苗”，仓促收进赶制出来的半成品，草草发出剪剪贴贴的稿件，对还需作者苦心修改的书稿采取“流水作业法”突击加工。质量要求云乎哉，它焉得不在这种作法下，变得次要而又次要了呢！有的编辑部也因此而不乐意处理选题外的稿件，因为虽有好书，却仍要被当做“计划外”的，统计表上还是个不光彩。
    出版社的编辑工作实行计划化，本来有提高书籍质量的好作用。特别是对加强出版物的目的性，和切合群众需要方面，作用十分显著。然而，一旦要求过高、过严、过死，脱离了写作、编辑作为脑力劳动的特点，却会反过来对提高书籍质量有害，甚至助长某些作者在写作上不严肃的作风，也对百家争鸣不利。
    现在看来，这种计划的办法，是要改一改才好了。
    这里最重要的，是要把选题、编辑工作计划和出书计划分开。前二者虽然规定着工作的方向和时间要求，必须遵循；但它只能作为一个有待争取实现的目标，要容许较多的变动。因为任何选题，即使有了作者，有了约稿合同，也还有完成的顺利或困难，写出来后质量的高或低，处理工作的繁或简，如此等等一系列不能事先算定的情况。
    后者应该是一个有充分现实性的生产计划，要列入国民经济计划。它不能以前者的选题为选题，而只能根据已审阅可用和已约而可靠的都有把握发下的书稿制定，它的变动才有可能做到较小。选题可以有长年和年度的列题计划，为的是体现方针有明确具体的争取目标。出书虽也有年度计划，但却不应机械规定列题的百分比，只要提出出书的方面，总指标，类别比例便可。它只能在季度计划时再全部列题，而月度计划时再完全固定。它是作者和编辑把工作做完了做好了的结果，而不是预定夹生饭的合同。像这样，才能把一度本末颠倒的现象纠正过来。
    在今后，考察一个出版社的成绩，也应该着重从总的方面，看它出了些什么书，特别是书出得好不好，而不应该对某些个别选题的是否实现斤斤计较，老把百分比拿着量尺寸，形式主义地看问题。
    书籍质量好坏，原因当然不尽在这里，但却确与上面说的有相当关系。而且几年来，我们的出版工作实行了计划化，好处谁也看到了。但这之中，究竟哪些做法对了，哪些有毛病、要改了才能把工作更推进一步，却值得好好的重新想一想。
