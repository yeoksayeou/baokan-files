Xinhua News Agency, Kandahar, January 24th: Premier Zhou Enlai and his party visited a section of the Helmand River water conservancy project near Kandahar on the afternoon of the 23rd. The project aims to fully control the 700-kilometer-long Helmand River, whose water previously flowed into the swamps on the Afghan border without being utilized. The guests stood on the Arghandab Dam, which is 61 meters high and 542 meters long, facing the reservoir where one or two mountaintops had been submerged into small islands. In front of them was a colored map, and they listened to a person in charge explain the achievements that this enormous water conservancy project has already made and its potential future capabilities. A few dozen miles northwest of where they stood is another dam, several times larger than the Arghandab Dam. This is the Kajakai Dam, said to be the fifth-largest dam in the world, which blocks the waters of the Helmand River.

This part of the overall project began in 1946 and was contracted by the American Morrison-Knudsen Company. The management work has now been taken over by Afghan engineers.

    周总理参观了阿富汗的水利工程
    据新华社坎大哈24日电　周恩来总理等一行在23日下午参观了坎大哈附近的赫尔曼德河水利工程的一部分。这项工程是要完全控制长七百公里的赫尔曼德河，这条河里的水以前流在阿富汗边境的沼地中而未被利用。客人们站在高六十一公尺、长五百四十二公尺的阿尔甘达水坝上，面对着把一、两座山顶淹成了小岛的水库，面前摊着一幅彩色地图，听取一位负责人向他们说明这项巨大的水利工程现在已经取得的成就和它将来的潜在能力。离他们站的地方再往西北几十英里又有另外一座水坝，这座水坝有阿尔甘达水坝好几倍大，这就是卡贾凯水坝，据说是世界上第五大水坝，它拦住了赫尔曼德河的河水。
    全部工程中的这一部分工程是在1946年开始的，由美国摩里逊—努逊公司承包。管理工作现在已经由阿富汗工程师接了过来。
