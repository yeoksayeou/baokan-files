    Launch a Forest Fire Prevention Campaign
    By the People's Daily Commentator

    Since last autumn, forest fires in southern regions have been very serious. In Hubei Province, from September to December of last year alone, according to statistics from only 45 counties, a total of 317 mountain fires occurred, burning over 360,000 mu of forest land. In Hunan Province, from August to November of last year, over 700 mountain fires occurred, burning over 267,000 mu of forest land. In Fujian Province, from July to December of last year, over 490 mountain fires occurred, damaging an area of over 200,000 mu. In Guangdong Province, from September to mid-December of last year, over 1,200 mountain fires of varying sizes occurred, damaging over 950,000 mu of mountain forest land. In Guangxi Province, from September to mid-December, over 2,000 mountain fires occurred, destroying over 645,000 mu of forest land. If such serious forest fires are not actively prevented, not only will the timber needed for national economic construction be impossible to guarantee, but the task of greening the motherland in twelve years will also be difficult to achieve. Is it possible to prevent forest fires? According to existing experience, as long as the leadership attaches importance to it, relies on the masses, controls fire sources, and actively launches a forest fire prevention campaign, it is entirely possible.
    During the fire prevention period, Shangzhi County in Heilongjiang Province listed forest fire prevention as one of its central tasks, made fire prevention plans, and the county party committee and county head personally arranged and inspected, thus achieving five years without forest fires. In Ankang Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, because the prefectural party committee secretary and commissioner personally arranged forest fire prevention work, they not only ensured that the entire prefecture's forestry cadre force was used for forest fire prevention work, but also assigned other cadres going to the countryside to take on forest fire prevention tasks. The county heads all went deep into the forest areas to inspect work. Therefore, Ning陝 (Ning Shan), 嵐皋 (Lan Gao), and 鎮坪 (Zhen Ping) counties experienced no fires throughout the year. In addition, many villages without forest fires have also appeared in provinces such as Jilin, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hubei. Shanxi Province has a total of sixty-three forest management stations, of which twenty-six have had no fires in three years and twenty-two have had no fires in five years. These facts prove that whichever place's party and government leadership organs attach importance to fire prevention and cadres personally get involved, that place will have significant achievements in forest fire prevention; and which forest areas establish forest management stations to protect and manage the existing forests, those forest areas will have significantly fewer fires.
    Closely integrating forest fire prevention work with agricultural and sideline production can both protect the safety of forest resources and ensure the smooth progress of production, achieving both production and fire prevention. Otherwise, once a fire starts, it will cause huge losses to state property and also require mobilizing a large amount of manpower to fight the fire, which will inevitably hinder production. Some people believe that agricultural production tasks are heavy and there is no time to lead and arrange fire prevention work. This is incorrect. Under the principle of not destroying forests and soil and water conservation, allowing people in forest areas to obtain practical benefits from the mountains and forests can increase their enthusiasm for loving and protecting forests. The masses engaging in sideline occupations in the mountains should neither be restricted too strictly nor allowed to be completely unmanaged. Management should be appropriately strengthened, organizing them into teams or groups, assigning special personnel to lead them, assigning them forest fire prevention tasks, and dividing activity areas. This can not only increase the income of the masses but also do a good job in forest protection.
    Relying on the masses, carefully analyzing fire sources, and controlling fire sources is one of the fundamental ways to prevent forest fires. The majority of forest fires that have occurred over the years have been caused by farmers' careless use of fire for production. Therefore, as long as the fire source is carefully analyzed and the use of fire for production is strictly controlled, fires can be reduced with immediate results. How to control fire sources? Local experiences tell us that replacing burning ash for fertilizer accumulation with cutting grass to make fermented fertilizer or compost, replacing hunting with setting fires to drive away animals, prohibiting deforestation for cultivation, prohibiting herdboy from playing with fire, prohibiting smoking in the forest, replacing burning paper for grave sweeping with hanging paper, and strictly preventing counter-revolutionaries from setting fires, are all things that should be paid attention to. In addition, it is also necessary to grasp the patterns of forest fires, such as the spring and autumn seasons in the northern regions and the winter and spring seasons in the southern regions being the seasons most prone to fires, and strict precautions should be taken at that time. At the same time, necessary technical measures for forest fire prevention should be taken, such as opening firebreaks, building forest area roads and watchtowers, organizing communication and liaison, and using chemical methods to extinguish fires, so that once a fire starts, it can be quickly extinguished.
    After the merging of districts and townships and agricultural cooperativization, the original forest protection organizations have been dismantled. At present, basic-level forest fire prevention committees should be established with agricultural production cooperatives or townships as units, and forest fire prevention teams or groups should be established with production teams of cooperatives as units, and they should be taught knowledge of forest fire prevention and firefighting. At the same time, responsibility protection areas should be divided and the joint defense system should be strengthened. For example, Huitong County in Hunan Province divides the entire forest area of the county into 532 plots, which are respectively responsible for protection by various agricultural cooperatives; and the production teams in the cooperatives also implement contract responsibility by area. Another example is that the townships adjacent to Zhuxi County in Hubei Province and Pingli County in Shaanxi Province held a joint forest fire prevention meeting and formulated a joint defense agreement, which are all good methods. In addition, it is also necessary to widely publicize the importance of forest fire prevention and related policies and regulations. Only in this way can the forest fire prevention campaign be launched and achieve good results.

    开展森林无火灾运动
    本报评论员
    去年秋天以来，南方各地山林火灾十分严重。湖北省自从去年9月到12月仅据四十五个县的统计，共发生山火三百一十七次，烧毁林地面积三十六万多亩。湖南省从去年8月到11月，共发生山火七百多次，烧毁林地面积二十六万七千多亩。福建省从去年7月到12月发生山火四百九十多次，被害面积二十多万亩。广东省从去年9月到12月中旬共发生大小山火一千二百多次，被害山林面积达九十五万多亩。广西省自9月到12月中旬，共发生两千多次山火，毁林面积六十四万五千多亩。这样严重的森林火灾，如不积极设法杜绝，不仅国家经济建设所需的木材无法保证，十二年绿化祖国的任务也很难实现。杜绝森林火灾是否可能呢？根据已有的经验，只要领导重视，依靠群众，控制火源，积极开展森林无火灾运动，是完全可以办到的。
    黑龙江省尚志县在防火期间，把护林防火列为中心任务之一，做出防火计划，县委和县长亲自布置检查，因而做到五年没有发生森林火灾。陕西省安康专区，由于地委书记、专员亲自布置护林防火工作，不仅保证全专区的林业干部力量用于护林防火工作上，并责成其他下乡干部兼负护林防火任务，各县长都深入林区检查工作，因而，出现了宁陕、岚皋、镇坪三县全年没发生火灾的情况。此外，吉林、广东、福建、湖北等省也出现了许多无森林火灾乡。山西省共有六十三个森林经营所，其中三年内没发生火灾的二十六个，五年没发生火灾的二十二个。这些事实证明了，哪个地方的党政领导机关重视防火，干部亲自动手，哪个地方的护林防火工作就有显著成绩；哪些林区设立了森林经营所把现有林子保护管理起来，哪些林区火灾就显著减少。
    使护林防火工作同农业副业生产密切结合起来，既可以保护好森林资源的安全，又可以保证顺利地进行生产，做到生产和防火两不误。否则，一旦起火，就会使国家财产受到巨大的损失，同时也要动员大量人力去扑火，势必妨碍生产。有人认为，农业生产任务繁重，没有时间领导和安排防火工作，这是不对的。在不破坏森林和水土保持的原则下，使林区群众从山林中得到实际利益，可以提高他们爱林护林的积极性。对群众入山搞副业，既不应限制过严过多，也不可放任自流，要适当地加强管理，把他们组成队或组，指定专人领导，交给护林防火任务，划分活动区域。这样不仅可以使群众增加收入，还可以做好护林工作。
    依靠群众，认真分析火源，控制火源，是杜绝森林火灾的根本办法之一。历年发生的森林火灾，多数是农民生产用火不慎所引起的。因此，只要认真分析火源，严格控制生产用火，就能立杆见影地减少火灾。如何控制火源呢？各地经验告诉我们，以割草沤粪或制堆肥来代替烧灰积肥，以打猎代替放火驱兽，禁止毁林开荒，禁止牧童玩火，禁止在林内吸烟，以挂纸代替上坟烧纸，严防反革命分子烧山等，都是应当注意的。此外，还要掌握森林火灾的规律，如北方地区每年春秋两季、南方地区冬春两季是最易发生火灾的季节，到时候要严加防范。同时，应采取必要的护林防火技术措施，如开辟防火线、修筑林区公路和了望楼，组织通信联络、用化学方法灭火等，做到一旦起火就能迅速扑灭。
    在撤区并乡和农业合作化以后，原来的护林组织已经拆散，目前应以农业生产合作社或以乡为单位，建立基层护林防火委员会，以合作社的生产队为单位，建立护林防火队或组，并向他们传授护林防火和救火的知识。同时，还要划分责任防护区，加强联防制度。如湖南省会同县把全县有林地区划分为五百三十二片，由各个农业合作社分别负责保护；而社里的生产队，也实行分片包干。又如湖北省竹溪县和陕西省平利县相毗连的各乡，召开了护林防火联防会议，制定了联防公约，都是很好的办法。此外，还应该广泛地宣传护林防火的重要性和有关政策法令。只有这样，森林无火灾运动才能开展起来，才能收到良好的效果。
