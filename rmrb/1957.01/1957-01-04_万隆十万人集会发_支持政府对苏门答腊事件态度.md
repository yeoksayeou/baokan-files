    Supports Government's Attitude Towards Sumatran Events
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 3rd - A mass rally of approximately ten thousand people was held in Bandung on January 1st. The conference adopted a resolution supporting the clear attitude of the Indonesian government and the Supreme Commander towards the North Sumatra and Central Sumatra incidents. The resolution also demanded that all groups and parties genuinely uphold the results of the general election.
    The resolution of this conference expressed respect for the policies implemented by the Sastroamidjojo cabinet. It urged the government and all people to more thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference to eradicate colonialism, and urged the government to more concretely implement the first five-year construction plan to strengthen the country's position and improve the welfare of the Indonesian people.
    The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the All-Indonesia People's Congress, in its New Year's message issued on January 1st, called on the people of the country to unite with the government to "defend the Republic of the Proclamation of Independence." The message warned that some dissatisfaction with the current situation has now been exploited by selfish elements, and there have been signs of foreign interference, which will endanger the foundation of the country and democratic life.

    万隆十万人集会
    支持政府对苏门答腊事件态度
    新华社雅加达3日电　万隆在1日举行了大约有十万人参加的群众大会。大会通过决议支持印度尼西亚政府和最高统帅对北苏门答腊和中苏门答腊事件的明确态度。决议还要求一切集团和政党真正维护普选的结果。
    这个大会的决议对沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁执行的政策表示敬意。它促请政府和全体人民一起更加彻底地实施亚非会议的决议以铲除殖民主义，并且促请政府更加具体地实施第一个五年建设计划，以加强国家的地位和增进印度尼西亚人民的福利。
    全印度尼西亚人民代表大会全国委员会常务委员会在1月1日发表的新年文告中号召全国人民同政府团结在一起，“保卫独立宣言共和国”。文告提醒说，对现状的一些不满情绪目前已被那些利己分子所利用，并且已经有外国干涉的迹象，这将危害国家和民主生活的根基。
