Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 18th: Organizing veteran teachers to tutor new teachers in preparing for new courses and introducing teaching experience to new teachers is part of the winter vacation activities recently arranged by the Chongqing education department for more than a thousand new middle and primary school teachers.

As early as a month ago, the Chongqing education department began to conduct in-depth investigations into the difficulties of new teachers. Their difficulties mainly lie in not being able to grasp the basic concepts of the curriculum well, as well as the inherent connections between each lesson and each stage, thus failing to inspire students' profound understanding of the curriculum content. Some physics teachers are troubled by the fact that the experiments they conduct do not conform to the scientific principles stated in the textbooks. In response to these difficulties of new teachers, the Chongqing education department put forward the principle of "what to teach, what to learn," preparing to organize more than 500 new teachers who have difficulties in teaching six courses such as Chinese, mathematics, physics, and biology in more than 50 middle schools and 15 primary school affiliated junior high school classes to study during a week or so of the winter vacation, and organize veteran middle school teachers and university teachers to tutor them.

    充分利用寒假空隙时间
    重庆老教师辅导新教师备课
    据新华社重庆18日电　组织老教师辅导新教师预备新课程和向新教师介绍教学经验，是重庆市教育部门最近给一千多个中、小学新教师安排的寒假生活的一部分。
    早在一个月前，重庆市教育部门就着手深入调查了新教师的困难。他们的困难主要是不能很好掌握课程的基本概念，以及每一课、每阶段之间的内在联系，因此不能启发学生对课程内容的深刻理解。有些物理学教师为自己所做的实验不能符合教科书上说的科学原理而苦恼。重庆市教育部门针对新教师的这些困难，提出“教什么、学什么”的原则，准备在五十多所中学和十五个小学附设的初中班中组织对语文、数学、物理学和生物学等六门课程教学有困难的五百多名新教师，利用寒假中一星期左右的空隙时间进修，并且组织中学的老教师和大专学校教师对他们进行辅导。
