    Caused by Freely Bringing "Grain Coupons"
    With the rapid development of the nation's construction, it is natural that certain materials and equipment cannot keep up with the needs of production development. However, there are also artificial tensions and unreasonable phenomena.
    When our purchasing personnel go to self-marketing factories to order goods, the manufacturing factory says, "A ordering conference is being held in Beijing, and we will not accept any tasks here." When we arrive at the ordering conference in Beijing, the manufacturing factory says, "The tasks are full, and no more orders can be placed here; you can only go to the factory." This kind of back-and-forth refusal puts the purchasing personnel in a dilemma.
    When ordering mechanical equipment, some time ago, we were asked to bring our own "grain coupons" (supply of steel). We ordered four belt conveyors in Shanghai, and the factory asked us to supply nine tons of steel plates, as well as electric motors, belts, ball bearings, and some factories even wanted pig iron and gauze-wrapped wire.
    Due to the urgency of the need, the purchasing personnel had no choice but to run around looking for goods on the market, but they were also subject to regional restrictions. For example, when I went to Harbin, I finally came across an M-340 electric meter, and I was unspeakably happy, but the salesperson asked, "Which unit are you from? Where are you located?" After we answered truthfully, the salesperson said, "No, our products are not supplied to other places." It was useless to say nice things. Later, the salesperson saw that we were in urgent need and came up with an "idea" saying, "You can say you are local, otherwise we won't sell it to you." For the sake of need, we had no choice but to lie.
    Now many grassroots units are at a loss at the ordering conferences, and some are afraid of damaging their relationship with the manufacturing factories and dare not raise any opinions. This will not solve the problem. It is hoped that the relevant leading units will take effective measures to correct these unreasonable phenomena.　　　　Wang Jia Yi

### 自由带“粮票”所引起的

    自由带“粮票”所引起的
    随着国家建设事业的迅速发展，某些物资和设备赶不上生产发展的需要，这是很自然的。然而也出现了人为的紧张和不合理的现象。
    当我们采购人员到自销厂订货时，承制厂说：“现在北京召开订货会议，我们这里一概不接任务。”来到北京的订货会上，承制厂又说：“任务接满了，这里不能再订，只有到厂里去。”这样来回推却，叫采购人员左右为难。
    在订机械设备时，前一些时候要我们自带“粮票”（供给钢材）。我们在上海订了四台皮带运输机，厂里要我们供给九吨钢板，还要电动机、皮带、滚珠轴承，有些厂还要生铁、纱包线等。
    由于需要的迫切，采购人员只好东奔西走，在市场上找现货，但又受到了地区的限制。如我到哈尔滨去，好容易才碰到M—340的电表，真是有说不出的高兴，但售货员问：“你们是哪个单位？在什么地方？”我们照实的回答以后，售货员说：“不行，我们的产品不供给外地。”说好话吧，也是枉然。后来售货员见我们实在是需要迫切，才出了一个“主意”说你们可以说是本地的，不然就不卖给你们。”为了需要，我们也不得不说假话了。
    现在很多基层单位在订货会上一筹莫展，有些怕与承制厂搞坏关系而不敢提意见，这样下去是不能解决问题。希有关领导单位采取有效的措施，纠正这些不合理的现象。　　　　王甲一
