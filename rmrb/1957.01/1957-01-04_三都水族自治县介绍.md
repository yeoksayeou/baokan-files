The Shui ethnic group, formerly known as the Shui family, possesses a long history and cultural tradition. Everyone can sing and dance, and they have their own calendar, language, and script. The Shui people consider the ninth month of the lunar calendar as the first month of the year. Their language belongs to the Dong-Tai language family, and their script resembles pictographs, leading some experts to believe that the origins of Shui culture can be traced back to the Shang Dynasty.

The Shui people are primarily engaged in agricultural production, excelling in cultivating rice, corn, cotton, and other crops. There are also quite a few craftsmen, with almost every village having skilled iron, wood, stone, bamboo, and construction workers. The Shui people live in wooden houses built against the mountains, and they prefer to use blue and indigo colors for their clothing. Every year during the Shui New Year in the ninth month of the lunar calendar, after the harvest is complete, people put on festive attire and gather by the thousands on the "New Year Slope" to watch the horse races of strong men and listen to the folk songs of the young women. In the evening, people invite relatives and friends to their homes to drink and sing, and the village is filled with the joyous sound of bronze drums.

The Sandu Shui Autonomous County is based on the original Sandu County, including Shui settlements in neighboring counties such as Libo, Dushan, and Rongjiang, covering an area of approximately four thousand square kilometers, with a population of over 160,000, of which over 100,200 are Shui people.

According to the Shui people, Sandu County is a place as beautiful as a phoenix feather. The entire area has high mountains, plains, hills, and river valleys, with mountain peaks often hidden in the clouds. At the foot of the mountains, countless silver rivers meander, like lace on the clothes of Shui girls, bordering these mountains with white. Among the mountains, one can see patches of green pine and fir trees, and in remote areas, there are also primeval forests with trees covering the sky. This is one of the main tung oil producing areas in Guizhou Province. The fragrant mushrooms and tree ears here have been sold as far away as Hunan and Guangdong. Mineral resources are also abundant, and large amounts of iron, mercury, coal, phosphorus, antimony, lead, zinc, and other minerals have been discovered. The Shui people are very hardworking; if a young man cannot cultivate the land and a young woman cannot weave, it will be difficult for them to find a lover.

Before liberation, the Shui people repeatedly engaged in heroic struggles against the reactionary ruling class to oppose national oppression. The historical deeds of the Shui hero Pan Xin-zhou, who led a peasant uprising of his people against the feudal rule of the Qing Dynasty a century ago, are still spread among the Shui people.

After liberation, the Shui people became masters of their own destiny, and production has gradually developed. Iron farm tools and advanced farming methods have been widely used on the slopes that were previously cultivated with "slash-and-burn" techniques. In 1956, the total grain output increased by 50% compared to 1950. The tragic life of the Shui people, who for many years suffered from "half a year of bran and vegetable diet" and "wind sweeping the ground and the moon as a lamp," has changed. The scene of "every household having surplus grain and everyone wearing new clothes" has gradually emerged in many villages.

    三都水族自治县介绍
    水族即过去的水家族，具有悠久的历史文化传统。人人能歌善舞，有自己的历法、语言和文字。水族以阴历九月为正月。语言属洞台语系，文字类似象形文，因此曾有专家认为水族文化渊源似可追溯到商代。
    水族人民主要从事农业生产，擅长栽种稻谷、玉米、棉花等作物。手工业者也相当多，几乎每个村寨都有熟练的铁、木、石、竹、泥水等工匠。水族人民住在靠山的木楼上，衣饰喜用青、蓝两色。每当阴历九月水族新年，收获完毕的时候，人们便穿着节日盛装，成千上万地来到“年坡”上，看健儿们赛马，听姑娘们唱山歌。晚间，人们招待亲友在家里饮酒高歌，寨子里一片欢乐的铜鼓声。
    三都水族自治县以原三都县为基础，包括荔波、都匀、独山和榕江等邻县的水族聚居区，面积约四千平方公里，人口有十六万多，其中水族十万零二千多人。
    三都县按水族人民的说法，是像凤凰羽毛一样美丽的地方。整个地区既有高山、平坝，也有丘陵和河谷，山岭峰巅经常隐没在云雾中。群山脚下，盘亘着无数条银色的河流，像水族姑娘衣裳的花边一样，把这些大山镶了一道白边。群山丛中到处可以看到一片片碧绿的松、杉，在偏僻的地方，还有枝叶蔽天的原始森林。这里是贵州省桐油主要产区之一。这里的香菌、木耳曾远销湖南、广东。矿藏也很丰富，目前已发现了大量的铁、水银、煤、磷、锑和铅、锌等多种矿。水族人民十分勤劳，如果小伙子不会耕种，姑娘不会纺织，那就很难找到爱人。
    解放前，水族人民为了反对民族压迫，曾经一次又一次地同反动统治阶级进行英勇斗争。百年前水族英雄潘新纣领导本民族农民起义反对清朝封建统治的史迹，至今还在水族人民中传扬。
    解放后，水族人民当家作了主人，生产也逐步得到发展。过去“刀耕火种”的山坡上，已普遍使用铁质农具和先进的耕作方法，1956年粮食总产量比1950年增产五成。使水族人民多年以来“糠菜半年粮”、“风来风扫地、月来月作灯”的悲惨生活改变了，不少村寨中逐渐出现“户户有余粮、人人穿新衣”的景象。
