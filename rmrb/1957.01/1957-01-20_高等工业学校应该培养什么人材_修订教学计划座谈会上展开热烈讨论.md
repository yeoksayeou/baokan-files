What Kind of Talent Should Higher Industrial Schools Cultivate?
Heated Discussions at the Symposium on Revising Teaching Plans

(Our dispatch) Beijing – The Ministry of Higher Education convened a symposium in Beijing on January 11 to revise the teaching plans of higher industrial schools. The meeting called for focusing on the results of discussions in various schools to study some fundamental issues in higher industrial education, especially the question of what kind of talent higher industrial schools should cultivate; and to revise the teaching plans of several typical majors based on the discussion and revision of the teaching plans.

At the beginning of the symposium, Tang Shouyu, Director of the Industrial Education Department, gave a comprehensive introduction to the discussions and problems in various schools over the past few months, and put forward issues and preliminary opinions that needed further study at the meeting.

The teachers first discussed two policy issues in higher industrial education. Regarding the relationship between quantity and quality, many teachers believed that the quantity of senior technical personnel required by various business departments was very doubtful, and suggested that the Ministry of Higher Education further calculate with the business departments to accurately determine the needs of factories and mines for cadres, so as to avoid affecting quality due to excessive enrollment. Everyone pointed out that in the past few years, due to the emphasis on quantity and neglect of quality, problems such as low entry-level of students, heavy burden on teachers, and insufficient basic construction equipment have seriously affected the improvement of teaching quality. In the future, special attention should be paid to improving quality.

Regarding the principle of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with China's actual conditions, everyone agreed that in the past few years, various schools have achieved great success in learning from the Soviet Union's science and technology and higher education experience, and have basically completed the task of teaching reform. The professional level of graduates has generally improved compared with before liberation. The Soviet Union's adoption of professional education methods, the implementation of the principles of combining politics with business, and linking theory with practice in teaching are all worth learning. The problem is that we have not been able to creatively apply the Soviet experience according to our country's actual conditions, which has resulted in the shortcomings of dogmatism and formalism in teaching systems, content, and methods. The main shortcomings of the teaching plan are that it is too heavy, too restrictive, and lacks flexibility in execution.

At the symposium, the most heatedly discussed question was: What kind of talent should higher industrial schools cultivate? Many people believe that this is the central issue in revising the teaching plan, which involves a series of issues such as training objectives, professional division, the proportion of scientific theory knowledge and production technology knowledge, and the specific arrangements of the teaching plan.

The unanimous opinion in the discussion was: Higher industrial schools should cultivate senior industrial construction talents who serve socialist construction, are physically healthy, love the motherland, have a certain level of Marxism-Leninism ideological awareness, and master advanced science and technology. Special attention should be paid to improving quality in the training process. The key to improving quality is to lay a solid foundation, so that students have basic theoretical and professional technical knowledge, learn the most basic things, and master the weapons to solve problems.

The main difference lies in the different views on the content of the foundation and the proportion of scientific theory and production technology knowledge. Some teachers believe that laying a solid foundation should first pay attention to the scientific theory part, which is the most important issue in cultivating talents. Only when students have broad and solid basic theoretical knowledge can they be considered to have mastered the weapons to solve problems, and they can have the best development prospects in future work. Therefore, they advocated that graduates of higher industrial schools should only have the basic knowledge of engineers, and need to undergo a certain period of training to be competent for engineer work, and should not be awarded the title of engineer; the scope of business learned by students in higher industrial schools should be broader, and professional divisions should generally be wider. They believe that students should also learn some production technology knowledge, but now the descriptive materials in some professional courses are too complicated, and there are too many professional courses, which should be deleted and merged; it is wrong to try to teach students all the knowledge required by field engineers, and a lot of production technology knowledge can be learned on-site.

Another part of the teachers emphasized that the content of the foundation is not only scientific theoretical knowledge, but also should include a considerable amount of production technology knowledge. They believe that according to the needs of the rapid development of national industrial construction, higher industrial schools should give students more production technology knowledge so that students can quickly adapt to the needs of work after graduation. They also emphasized that production technology knowledge cannot be learned by students after working on-site. Overemphasizing theory in teaching may neglect production technology knowledge and deviate from reality. Therefore, they advocated that the training goal of higher industrial schools is engineers, and graduates should be awarded the title of engineer; the majors can also be divided narrower or specialized according to the needs of industrial construction; in the teaching plan, professional courses should maintain a considerable proportion, and production technology knowledge is indispensable.

When discussing the flexibility of implementing the teaching plan, most teachers believed that the Ministry of Higher Education should formulate teaching plans for each major, so as to reflect the country's basic requirements for the quality of cadre training to a certain extent, and to give a clear direction for the teaching work of various schools. However, in order to adapt to the different conditions and circumstances of various schools and facilitate the school's organization of teaching work, there can be greater flexibility in implementation.

At present, the discussion of general principle issues has ended. The teachers are grouping to draft five-year and four-year teaching plans for majors such as metal cutting machine tools and tools for mechanical manufacturing industry, internal combustion engines, power plant power grids and power systems, industrial and civil buildings, and inorganic materials engineering.

More than 80 teachers and representatives of relevant business departments from Harbin Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, Jiaotong University, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University, Dalian Institute of Technology, Tongji University, Zhejiang University, East China Institute of Chemical Technology, Shandong Institute of Technology, Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering, and Chengdu Institute of Technology, who were entrusted by the Ministry of Higher Education to revise the teaching plan, participated in the symposium. Other higher engineering colleges and universities in Beijing also sent people to attend the symposium.

    高等工业学校应该培养什么人材
    修订教学计划座谈会上展开热烈讨论
    本报讯　高等教育部于1月11日在北京召开了高等工业学校修订教学计划座谈会。会议要求集中各校讨论的成果，研究高等工业教育中的一些基本问题，特别是高等工业学校应该培养什么人材的问题；并在讨论修订教学计划的基础上修订几个典型专业的教学计划。
    座谈会开始时，由工业教育司唐守愚司长就几个月来各校讨论情况和问题作了综合的介绍，并提出了会上需要进一步研究的问题和初步意见。
    教师们首先就高等工业教育中两个方针性的问题进行了讨论。在数量和质量的关系问题上，很多教师认为现在各业务部门对高级技术人材所需要的数量很值得怀疑，并建议高等教育部进一步和业务部门算算账，切实摸清楚厂矿企业对干部的需要量，以免招生过多影响质量。大家指出，过去几年由于强调数量忽视质量，造成了入学学生水平低、师资负担重、基本建设设备不足等问题，严重地影响了教学质量的提高，今后应该特别注意提高质量。
    在学习苏联先进经验并与中国实际情况相结合的方针方面，大家一致认为几年来各校学习苏联科学技术和高等教育经验，取得了很大的成绩，基本上完成了教学改革的任务。毕业生的业务水平一般都较解放前有所提高。苏联采用专业教育的方法，在教学中贯彻政治与业务结合、理论与实际联系等原则，都是值得学习的。问题在于我们没有能够根据我国实际情况创造性地运用苏联经验，因之在教学制度、内容和方法上都产生了教条主义和形式主义的缺点。在教学计划方面主要的缺点是，分量过重、限制太死、缺乏执行上的灵活性。
    座谈会上，讨论最热烈的问题是：高等工业学校究竟应该培养什么人材？许多人认为这是修订教学计划的中心问题，它涉及培养目标、专业划分、科学理论知识和生产技术知识的比重以及教学计划的具体安排等一系列问题。
    讨论中一致的意见是：高等工业学校应该培养为社会主义建设服务的、体魄健全、热爱祖国和具有一定马克思列宁主义思想水平、掌握先进科学技术的高级工业建设人材。在培养过程中要特别注意提高质量。提高质量的关键在于打好基础，要使学生具备基本理论和专业技术的基础知识，学会最基本的东西和掌握解决问题的武器。
    主要的分歧是，对基础的内容、科学理论和生产技术知识各占多大比重的见解不同。有些教师认为，打好基础应首先注意科学理论部分，这是培养人材中最重要的问题，只有学生具备广泛而巩固的基础理论知识，才算是掌握了解决问题的武器，将来在工作中才可能有最好的发展前途。因此他们主张：高等工业学校的毕业生只具备工程师的基础知识，还需经过一定时期的锻炼才能胜任工程师工作，不应授予工程师称号；高等工业学校学生学习的业务范围应该广阔些，专业划分一般应宽一些。他们认为，学生也应学一些生产技术知识，但现在有些专业课程中叙述性的材料过于庞杂，专业课程也过多，应该删减合并；企图把现场工程师所需要的一切知识都教授给学生是不对的，很多生产技术知识都可以到现场去学。
    另外一部分教师强调基础的内容不仅是科学理论知识，还应当包括相当多的生产技术知识。他们认为根据国家工业建设急速发展的需要，高等工业学校应该给予学生较多的生产技术知识，以便学生毕业后很快地能适应工作需要。他们还强调生产技术知识并不是学生到现场工作后都能学到的，在教学中过分强调理论，可能会忽视生产技术知识、脱离实际。因此他们主张：高等工业学校的培养目标是工程师，应授予毕业生以工程师称号；专业也可以根据工业建设的需要划得窄些或分专门化；在教学计划中，专业课要保持相当多的比重，生产技术知识不可缺少。
    讨论到执行教学计划的灵活性问题时，多数教师都认为：高等教育部应该制定各专业的教学计划，以便在一定程度上体现国家对培养干部的质量的基本要求，使各校的教学工作有明确的方向。但为了适应各校不同的条件和情况，便于学校组织教学工作，在执行时可以有较大的灵活性。
    目前一般原则性问题的讨论已经结束。教师们正分组拟订机械制造工业金属切削机床及刀具、内燃机、发电厂电力网及电力系统、工业与民用建筑、无机物工学等专业五年制和四年制的教学计划。
    参加这次座谈会的有：受高等教育部委托修订教学计划的哈尔滨工业大学、清华大学、交通大学、南京工学院、天津大学、大连工学院、同济大学、浙江大学、华东化工学院，山东工学院、重庆建筑工程学院、成都工学院等校教师、有关业务部门代表共八十余人。北京市其他高等工科院校也派人列席了座谈会。
