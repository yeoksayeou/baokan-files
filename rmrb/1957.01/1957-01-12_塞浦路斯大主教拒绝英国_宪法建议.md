Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, January 11th: Cypriot newspapers reported on the 10th that Archbishop Makarios, the Cypriot public leader exiled by the British to the Seychelles Islands, has refused to accept the so-called "constitutional proposals" put forward by the British side for Cypriot "autonomy".

The British government's "constitutional proposals," put forward on December 19th of last year, were widely criticized by people from all walks of life in Cyprus from the very beginning. Therefore, about three weeks ago, the British authorities specially sent two representatives to the Seychelles Islands, attempting to use Makarios's prestige to promote their proposal, which in reality is intended to continue controlling Cyprus.

    塞浦路斯大主教拒绝英国“宪法建议”
    据新华社11日讯　尼科西亚消息：塞浦路斯的报纸10日报道，被英国放逐到塞舌耳群岛的塞浦路斯公众领袖马卡里奥斯大主教，拒绝接受英国方面提出的所谓让塞浦路斯“自治”的“宪法建议”。
    英国政府在去年12月19日提出的这个“宪法建议”一开始就遭到了塞浦路斯各阶层人士的广泛抨击。因此英国当局在大约三个星期以前，专门派了两个代表去塞舌耳群岛，企图利用马卡里奥斯的声望来推销它的这个实际上要继续控制塞浦路斯的建议。
