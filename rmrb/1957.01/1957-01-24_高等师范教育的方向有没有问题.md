Is There a Problem with the Direction of Higher Normal Education?
    Weng Shisheng, Wang Shaoyue, Zhong Ziao

Editor's Note: After the publication of the article "Where Should Normal Universities Go?" on page 7 of this newspaper on August 11, 1956, the editorial department successively received nearly seventy submissions and letters from readers in normal colleges and middle schools. Among these submissions and letters, some expressed agreement with the article, some supplemented it, and some expressed opposition to the main arguments of the article. The article by the three readers, Weng Shisheng and others, published here belongs to the latter category. Some of the specific situations mentioned in the article refer to the period before the autumn semester of 1956.

    On August 11, 1956, Mr. Dong Weichuan published an article in the "People's Daily" entitled "Where Should Normal Universities Go?" which clearly put forward the characteristics of higher normal education and made a theoretical exposition on the importance of educational disciplines and educational practice. This is of certain significance to higher normal education. However, we feel that there are many issues that can still be discussed.
    Mr. Dong Weichuan pointed out that in the old society, people did not pay attention to normal education, and only in the new society did they value it; however, the characteristic of normal education—cultivating teachers—has not received enough attention, which is specifically manifested in the contradiction between opening professional courses and education courses. This contradiction has become even more acute due to "marching towards science" and "opposing dogmatism." Therefore, Mr. Dong Weichuan raised the question of "Where Should Normal Universities Go?" and affirmed that an unfortunate situation of despising and excluding educational disciplines has been created in normal colleges and universities. He strongly disagreed with some people's opinions that the proportion of professional disciplines in normal colleges is too small and the burden on students is too heavy, advocating for merging political disciplines, reducing education disciplines, and simplifying educational practice.
    The teaching plan of normal colleges and universities consists of four parts: political disciplines, educational disciplines, professional disciplines, and educational practice. These four parts are closely linked and inseparable. But this does not mean that these four parts are of equal importance. At the same time, the current teaching plan's arrangement of courses in these four parts is not yet perfect, and it needs to be tested in practice and necessary revisions need to be made. Under the guidance of the overall policy of higher normal education, appropriately adjusting the proportion between the four parts will not lead higher normal education in another direction. For example, many people propose reducing the time for political classes, reducing classroom discussions, etc., which by no means signifies a change in the political direction of cultivating teachers. Opinions on education courses and educational practice will not change the vocational direction of cultivating teachers under the major premise. On the contrary, this is the hope of cultivating good teachers with higher political quality, richer educational knowledge, and more proficient professional skills.
    Perhaps it is because Mr. Dong Weichuan is worried that this quantitative change in reducing education courses will cause a fundamental qualitative change. Then let us look at several basic points of these opinions separately to see if they will change the direction of higher normal education.
    First, let's look at the history of education. Many people's opinion is to stop offering this course or change it to an elective course. Because the content currently taught in the history of education is all foreign, and it has no direct relationship to the work of non-education major students after graduation. Students generally feel a headache learning this course, feel it is a burden, and do not gain much. Especially the exams, they have to spend a long time memorizing them by rote. Graduates also generally feel that the history of education is of no help in their work. Mr. Dong Weichuan is right to say that learning the history of education can cultivate a developmental perspective; however, a developmental perspective is not only cultivated by learning the history of education. Can't the history of Chinese literature, the history of foreign literature, Chinese history, world history, etc., also cultivate students' developmental perspective? Can't the modern history of Chinese revolution and Marxism-Leninism also cultivate students' developmental perspective? In education, appropriately using historical materials can achieve the dual effect of enriching the content of education and narrating important issues in the history of education, thereby cultivating students' developmental perspective. Physics, chemistry, or other disciplines should also be taught in this way.
    The situation of the course "School Hygiene" is basically the same.
    As for education and psychology, the vast majority of people agree to retain them. Some even advocate increasing the teaching time for psychology.
    Let's look at the educational practice that Mr. Dong Weichuan repeatedly discussed. Its achievements are certain. Since there has been formal educational practice, normal colleges and universities have indeed taken a big step forward in cultivating teachers, and some new atmospheres have emerged. Educational practice must not be cancelled in the future, just as industrial colleges cannot cancel production practice. But there are also some issues that should be considered.
    According to the original plan, the internship is once in the third and fourth grades, each time for six weeks. But in fact, students have to start preparing several weeks in advance to welcome the internship. In this process, some classroom discussions of other courses often cannot be carried out, the designated reference books cannot be read in time, and some people even devote all their energy to preparing for the internship except for taking notes in class. During the internship, they shuttle back and forth between their own school and the internship school, attend large and small meetings, write diaries every day, and prepare lessons and give trial lectures, which is really extremely stressful, and even sleep time is affected. After the internship, their physical strength is greatly reduced, and just when their physical strength is recovering and they can concentrate on learning, the exam has arrived. Moreover, the third and fourth grades are the time when students have a certain level and urgently need to continue to deepen their professional knowledge and improve their ability to conduct independent research, and their courses are also relatively deep. Two internships have created a contradiction between heavy teaching content and insufficient teaching time. For example, the third and fourth grades of the history department are the time to study in detail modern and contemporary Chinese and foreign history, and long-term internships often affect the quality of learning these courses. From the perspective of teachers' burden, it is also too heavy. Each department of the school does not have full-time educational practice teachers, and each internship requires a large number of guiding teachers. Some departments have 250 people participating in the internship at a time. Calculating that every five people need one tutor, it requires as many as 50 tutors. Almost all teachers in some schools are involved in the internship work, and the burden on young teachers is particularly heavy. For the sake of internship, teachers have to relax teaching and relax further studies. Twice a year has a great impact. It is also impossible to hand over these tasks completely to middle school teachers. Mr. Dong Weichuan said based on the educational practice of Beijing Normal University: "Over the years, the fifty or so schools that have accepted internship tasks have mostly admitted that the internship is helpful for improving their own business; if it is only a burden and there is no benefit, they would not actively sign long-term mutual assistance contracts with us." If you look at it comprehensively, you can know that these middle schools felt that the internship was beneficial to them in the past few years because they basically did not understand the full set of teaching forms of Soviet middle schools and did not know how to organize observation teaching and evaluation, and they learned these things from the internship of normal universities. Today, the problem of middle schools is how to study these experiences in depth and further improve the quality of teaching, and this problem cannot be solved by the internship of third and fourth grade students without teaching experience. Moreover, the long-term contract signed with the middle school is a "mutual assistance contract"—the middle school helps the normal university guide the internship, and the normal university helps the middle school teachers improve their business and provide teaching materials. As for what the internship itself gives to the middle school, it needs to be calmly estimated. Furthermore, the task of general four-year normal colleges is to cultivate high school teachers. Why is it necessary to conduct junior high school teaching practice? And a very important task of normal universities is to cultivate teachers and graduate students of higher normal education. Shouldn't this be considered? Mr. Dong Weichuan also proposed that two internships are in line with the principle of "practice, recognition, re-practice, re-recognition." This principle is unbreakable, but it cannot be understood too narrowly. This law runs through the entire life (the entire human race)'s cognitive process. In the limited time of school, we should proceed from reality, specifically weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and distinguish the priorities. Under the current circumstances, in four-year normal colleges, especially in normal universities with special tasks, we think it is possible to consider reducing one educational practice.
    From these aspects, reducing education courses does not involve the direction of higher normal education.
    Mr. Dong Weichuan made a detailed exposition on the direction of higher normal education, and also raised the question of the difference between normal colleges and comprehensive universities. He said: "If we do not start from the different tasks and different directions, it will lead to the mistake of confusing the majors of the two universities simply because they have the same name, and even blindly comparing the level of academic achievement. Since we are cultivating teachers, it is necessary to master more knowledge and skills in education, and it is even more necessary for the majors they study to be combined with the educational disciplines they study." This is beyond doubt. Therefore, normal colleges and universities need to offer certain education courses and conduct educational practice.
    However, we are cultivating teachers, not abstract teachers, but specific professional teachers—physics teachers, history teachers, etc. Therefore, the study of professional courses should become an important part of the teaching plan. Professional courses are to enable students to acquire the knowledge necessary for future teaching. In addition to enabling students to understand the nature, purpose, and tasks of education, educational disciplines and educational practice largely enable students to master teaching methods and skills. Teaching methods and skills are only meaningful when they are reflected through the teaching of professional knowledge. A student of a normal college who only masters teaching methods and skills is difficult to become an excellent teacher. Therefore, mastering professional knowledge should be the main thing. Mr. Dong Weichuan said: "Even if... in this major... less learning some things... will be supplemented in the work position." Teacher further studies generally do not have much time, and it is not easy to find guiding teachers and reference materials in the work position. It is difficult to supplement major professional deficiencies in a short period of time. If it is said that professional knowledge can be supplemented in the work position, isn't it easier to improve teaching methods and skills in daily teaching practice? The priorities should be reasonably arranged and should not be confused and reversed.
    Mr. Dong Weichuan also put forward the requirements for scientific research in normal colleges, the special requirements for associate doctors and doctors in normal colleges, and also raised the question of whether to choose a normal college or a comprehensive university when going abroad to study. In today's highly developed science, cadres are cultivated along professional lines. Facing the premise of middle schools, teachers in normal colleges can be divided into two categories: one is engaged in education, including teachers of general education courses, teaching methods of each subject, and full-time leaders of educational practice; the other is teachers of other professional courses. Therefore, it cannot be required that the scientific research of every teacher in a normal college should focus on educational issues. For example, a teacher who studies advanced atomic physics does not need to only write papers on how to teach atomic physics in the classroom, but can study scientific issues that greatly exceed teaching requirements. The fact that educational issues are poorly researched today is a fact, but in order to add more research to it, we can only encourage and reward, but not force it. Not only teachers in normal colleges, but also middle school teachers. In order to do their job well, middle school teachers need to continuously improve their level in both professional and educational disciplines. If a middle school teacher conducts scientific research, he can focus on educational issues or other professional issues. It is completely possible for a middle school teacher to carry out purely professional research work in his spare time.
    If the above opinions can be affirmed, then it is not necessary to send students to normal colleges when sending students to study abroad. In many majors (such as political theory courses and certain natural sciences), teachers are not trained in normal colleges even in the Soviet Union. There is also no need to propose special requirements for taking associate doctors and doctors in normal colleges. They can be associate doctors and doctors in education, or associate doctors and doctors in other professional disciplines.
    Studying problems should proceed from reality, look at the essence of the problem, and seek specific methods to solve the problem. The current reality is that students have a heavy burden, lack specialization, and have poor independent working ability, which affects the completion of the training tasks of normal colleges. The essence of the problem is not a question of direction, but how to improve the quality of the students trained. Solving this problem requires starting from all aspects, including revising teaching syllabuses, improving the quality of teaching, improving teaching methods, improving the examination system, etc., and revising the teaching plan is also an important aspect.

    高等师范教育的方向有没有问题
    翁世盛　王绍岳　锺子翱
    编者按　1956年8月11日本报七版发表了“师范大学往那里去”一文以后，编辑部陆续收到师范院校和中学校的读者来稿、来信近七十件。在这些来稿、来信中，有对那篇文章表示赞同的，有加以补充的，也有对那篇文章的主要论点表示反对的。这里发表的翁世盛等三位读者的文章就是属于后一类的，文中列举的一些具体情况是指1956年秋季学期以前的。
    1956年8月11日，董渭川先生在“人民日报”上发表的“师范大学往那里去”一文，明确地提出了高等师范教育的特点，并且对教育学科、教育实习的重要性，作了理论上的叙述。这对高等师范教育是有一定意义的。但是，我们感到有不少问题还可以商榷。
    董渭川先生指出：在旧社会人们对师范教育是不重视的，只是在新社会才重视它；但是师范教育的特点——培养教师的问题没有得到足够的重视，具体表现在开设专业课和教育课的矛盾上，这一矛盾由于“向科学进军”和“反对教条主义”而更为尖锐。于是，董渭川先生提出了“师范大学往那里去”的问题，并且肯定地说：在师范院校已经造成了鄙薄和排斥教育学科的不幸。他对有些人根据师范院校专业学科的比重太轻和学生的负担太重两个理由，主张归并政治学科、减少教育学科和简化教育实习的意见，大不以为然。
    师范院校的教学计划是由政治学科、教育学科、专业学科和教育实习四个部分组成的。这四个部分是紧密联系不可分割的。但这决不是说这四个部分一般轻重。同时，当前的教学计划中关于这四部分课程的安排也不是已经完善，它需要在实践中检验并且作必要的修正。在高等师范教育总的方针指导下，适当地调整四部分之间的比例，并不会使高等师范教育走向另一个方向。比如很多人提出缩减政治课的时间、减少课堂讨论等，这丝毫不意味着是要改变培养教师的政治方向。有关教育课和教育实习方面的意见，在大前提之下也不会改变培养教师的职业方向。相反地这却是希望培养出政治质量更高、教育知识更丰富、专业技能更熟练的好教师来。
    或许会由于减少教育课的这种量变而引起根本的质变来罢，董渭川先生担心的是这一点。那我们就分别来看看这些意见的几个基本点会不会改变高等师范教育的方向。
    首先看看教育史。不少人的意见是停开这门课，或者改为选修。因为教育史目前讲授的内容都是外国的，对非教育系学生毕业后的工作来说，没有甚么直接的关系。学生们学这门课，普遍感到头痛，觉得是一种负担，没有多大的收获。尤其是考试，他们要花好长时间去死背。毕业生也普遍感到教育史在工作中没有什么帮助。董渭川先生说学教育史可以培养发展观，这是对的；但是发展观并非只有学教育史才能培养。中国文学史、外国文学史、中国史、世界史等，难道就不能培养学生的发展观吗？中国现代革命史和马克思列宁主义，难道就不能培养学生的发展观吗？在教育学中，适当地运用历史材料，就可以达到既充实了教育学的内容，又可以叙述教育史上的重要问题，从而培养学生发展观的双重效果。物理、化学或其他学科也应当是这样来讲授的。
    “学校卫生”这门课的情况基本上也是一样。
    至于教育学和心理学，绝大多数人都是同意保留的。有的还主张增加心理学的讲授时间。
    再看看董渭川先生反复论述的教育实习罢。它的成绩是肯定的。自从有了正规的教育实习以来，师范院校在培养师资方面确实进了一大步，出现了一些新气象。今后教育实习决不能取消，就像工业院校不能把生产实习取消一样。但也有一些问题是应该考虑的。
    实习按原订计划是三、四年级各一次，每次六周。但是事实上，为了迎接实习，学生们早好几周就要着手准备。在这过程中，往往其他课的一些课堂讨论不能进行了，指定的参考书来不及阅读了，有的人甚至除了上课记笔记以外，全力投入实习的准备工作。而实习期间，他们在自己学校和实习学校之间往返奔波，大会小会，每天写日记，再加上备课、试讲，实在是紧张异常，甚至睡眠时间也要受到影响。实习过后，他们体力大减，而正当体力恢复、能把精神集中于学习的时候，考试已经到了。再说三、四年级正是学生具备了一定水平，迫切需要继续加深专业知识的学习和提高独立钻研能力的时候，他们的课程也都比较深。由于两次实习，造成了教学内容繁重而讲授时间过少的矛盾。如历史系三、四年级正是详细学习中外近代史、现代史的时候，长时间的实习往往影响了对这些课的学习质量。从教师的负担来看，也过于沉重。学校各系并没有专职教育实习的教师，而每次实习都需要大量指导教师，有些系一次参加实习的有二百五十人，以每五人需要一个导师计算，就需要五十个导师之多。有的学校里几乎全体教师都投身实习工作，其中年青教师的负担尤其沉重。为了实习，教师们不得不放松教学、放松进修。一年两次，影响很大。要把这些任务完全交给中学教师，他们也是承担不了的。董渭川先生根据北京师范大学进行教育实习的情况说：“几年以来接受过实习任务的五十来所学校，绝大多数都承认实习对于他们自身业务的提高是有帮助的；如果只是负担而没有好处，他们就不会主动地和我们订立长期互助的合同了。”如果全面地看一下，就可以知道过去几年这些中学校所以感到实习对他们有好处，是因为以前他们基本上不了解苏联中学的全套教学形式，不了解如何组织观摩教学、评议，而从师范大学的实习学到了这些东西。今天中学校的问题是如何深入研究这些经验，进一步提高教学质量，而这问题光靠三、四年级没有教学经验的学生的实习，是解决不了的。而且同中学校订的长期合同是“互助合同”——中学帮助师范大学指导实习，而师范大学则帮助中学教师提高业务并供给教学资料。至于实习本身所给予中学校的东西，是需要冷静地估计的。再说，一般四年制的师范院校的任务是培养高中教员，为什么非进行初中教学的实习不可呢？而师范大学的一个很重要的任务是培养高等师范的师资和研究生，难道这一点就不应该考虑吗？董渭川先生还提出两次实习是符合“实践，认识，再实践，再认识”这一原理的。这一原理是颠扑不破的，但是不能理解得太狭隘。这个规律是贯穿在整个人生（整个人类）的认识过程中的。而在学校的有限时间中，应该从实际出发，具体地权衡利害，分辨轻重。在目前情况下，在四年制的师范院校，特别是在负有特殊任务的师范大学里，我们认为是可以考虑减少一次教育实习的。
    从这几个方面来看，减少教育课并不涉及高等师范教育的方向问题。
    董渭川先生对高等师范教育的方向问题作了详尽的阐述，还提出了师范院校同综合大学的区别问题。他说：“如果不从任务不同、方向不同着眼，那就会产生把两种大学的专业只因为名称相同而混为一谈的错误，甚至盲目地比较起学术水平的高低来。我们培养的既然是教师，就有必要多掌握一些教育方面的知识技能，而且他们所学的专业更完全有必要和所学的教育学科结合起来。”这是不容怀疑的。所以师范院校需要开设一定的教育课程并进行教育实习。
    但是，我们培养的是教师，并不是抽象的教师，而是具体的专业教师——物理教师、历史教师等等。因此，专业课的学习应该成为教学计划的重要部分。专业课程是为了使学生获得今后教学必需的知识，教育学科和教育实习除使学生了解教育的性质、目的和任务以外，很大一部分是使学生掌握教学方法和技能。而教学方法和技能，只有通过专业知识的讲授来体现才有意义。一个师范院校的学生，只掌握教学方法和技能，是很难成为一个优秀教师的。所以掌握专业知识应该是主要的。董渭川先生说：“即令……在本专业方面……少学了某些东西……会在工作岗位上补充起来的”。教师进修，一般时间不多，而在工作岗位上不容易找到指导教师和参考资料，想在短时间内补充专业上的重大缺陷是比较困难的。如果说在工作岗位上能补充专业知识，那在日常教学实践中不是更容易提高教学方法和技能吗？主次轻重是应该合理安排而不应该混淆颠倒的。
    董渭川先生还提出了师范院校科学研究的要求，师范院校副博士、博士的特殊要求等问题，也提出了去外国学习是选择师范学院还是综合大学的问题。在今天科学高度发达的情况下，干部是循着专业培养的。在面向中学的前提下，师范院校的教师可以分为两类，一类是搞教育的，包括一般教育课的教师、各科教学法和专职领导教育实习的教师；另一类是其他各专业课的教师。因此不能要求每个师范院校教师的科学研究都着重搞教育问题。比如一个研究高深的原子物理的教师，没有必要只写如何在课堂上讲授原子物理的论文，而可以研究大大超越教学要求的科学问题。今天教育问题研究得差是事实，但是为着对它多加研究，只能鼓励和奖励，而不能强求。不仅师范院校的教师这样，就是中学教师也是这样。中学教师为了做好工作，需要在专业学科和教育学科两方面不断提高水平。如果一个中学教师进行科学研究的话，那他既可以着重搞教育问题，也可以着重搞其他专业问题。一个中学教师在业余进行他本专业的纯专业性的研究工作，是完全可以的。
    如果上述意见可以肯定，在往国外派留学生的时候，就不必非往师范学院派不可。有很多专业（如政治理论课和某些自然科学）的师资，就是在苏联也不是在师范学院培养的。在师范院校考副博士、博士，也没有必要非提出特殊要求不可。他们可以是教育学方面的副博士、博士，也可以是其他专业学科的副博士、博士。
    研究问题应该从实际出发，看问题的实质，并寻求解决问题的具体方法。今天的实际情况是学生负担重、专业不专和独立工作能力差，因而影响了师范院校培养任务的完成。问题的实质并不是方向问题，而是如何提高所培养的学生的质量。解决这个问题需要从各方面入手，包括修改教学大纲、提高讲授质量、改进教学方法、健全考试制度等，而修改教学计划也是一个重要的方面。
