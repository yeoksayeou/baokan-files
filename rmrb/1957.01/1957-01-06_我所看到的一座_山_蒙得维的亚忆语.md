The "Mountain" I Saw
——Memories of Montevideo
Interview with Wang Li, Deputy Head of the South American Chinese Art Troupe

When our plane began to descend, we saw a small mountain, like a steamed bun, protruding into the mouth of the Rio de la Plata. This is Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay.

After getting off the plane, we met Mr. Farinella, a member of the Uruguayan Parliament. He politely handed over a business card printed with "Uruguayan Commercial Representative in Beijing," and also brought a large roll of newspapers, all of which published his speeches after returning from China to discuss trade.

Mr. Farinella was the organizer of the Chinese Art Troupe's performance in Uruguay. From the moment we met, Mr. Farinella enthusiastically talked about developing Sino-Uruguayan trade.

The theater where the art troupe performed was called "Sodre." "Sodre" is the committee of the Uruguayan government that manages cultural arts broadcasting. Mrs. Gabaró, the chairwoman of "Sodre," warmly received the leaders of the art troupe at her home.

Mrs. Gabaró enthusiastically introduced the national leaders of Uruguay to meet with the leaders of the art troupe.

During the intermission of the art troupe's premiere, Mr. Batlle Berres, one of the leaders of the Uruguayan Council of State and leader of the Colorado Party majority faction, received us.

The next day, this robust Uruguayan politician with a serious expression formally received us again at the presidential palace.

Mr. Batlle Berres, on behalf of his country, presented a Uruguayan national emblem to the Chinese Art Troupe.

Mr. Batlle Berres expressed his willingness to develop cultural relations between Uruguay and China. He was not only interested in Chinese classical drama and music, but also particularly wanted to know about Chinese modern music, and hoped to obtain Chinese records.

Mr. Batlle Berres also stated that he and his government were more concerned about the issue of developing Uruguayan-Chinese trade relations, saying, "Developing Uruguayan-Chinese trade is very important for Uruguay."

Mr. Batlle Berres also said, "Uruguay and China should also develop political ties."

Mr. Batlle Berres repeatedly dismissed the guests' intention to leave. He was also interested in the Chinese characters on the gifts given by the Chinese guests and even on their business cards. He inquired about the situation of Chinese character reform, saying that he had developed the desire to learn Chinese in recent years.

He summoned the photographer and took a photo with us, saying: "You can receive this autographed group photo at the hotel tomorrow."

The Uruguayan government has a federal Council of State system. Two-thirds of the members of the Council of State are from the Colorado Party, and one-third are from the Blanco Party. The chairmanship of the Council of State is held in rotation by Colorado Party members, each term lasting one year. The first chairman of this term was Batlle Berres, and this year it is Suviría's turn.

Chairman Suviría and his government's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Education, and the speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives, and the Mayor of Montevideo all separately received the leaders of the Chinese Art Troupe, and they all unanimously expressed their willingness to develop trade relations with China.

On that small mountain protruding into the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, there is a Uruguayan national slaughterhouse. The manager, Mr. Maragliano, a plump and shrewd businessman, warmly guided the members of the art troupe to carefully visit every part of the factory. The equipment of this factory is relatively old, but this Uruguayan competes with the American-owned, modernly equipped slaughterhouse next door with nationalistic confidence. The manager invited us to taste the canned goods produced by this factory, and he eagerly hoped that these products could be sold to China and other socialist countries.

The country's economy is centered on animal husbandry. There are an average of three cattle and six sheep per person. Nearly half of the country's population, more than one million people, are concentrated in Montevideo. This city mainly serves the processing of livestock products, and is also a transit port.

This country, known as the "Switzerland of the Americas," has historically and otherwise been blessed to be in a remote corner of the world, living a peaceful life.

In the decade or so since World War II, especially in the last three years, American capital, like a "demon," has brought the economic life of this peaceful country to the point of "exhaustion." Livestock products have been cut off from sales, many factories have closed down, or are in a state of semi-closure, a large number of workers are unemployed or underemployed, and the Uruguayan peso, which has always been known for its stability, used to be worth nine dimes and six cents to the dollar, but now it takes four pesos and eighty cents to exchange for one dollar.

The Uruguayan people, who have a tradition of national independence and democratic freedom, as well as the politicians and businessmen in power in Uruguay, are easily understood in their eagerness to find a way out because of their current situation.

Throughout Uruguay, only a very few pro-American financial capitalists represented by "El Bien Público" are obstructing the development of Sino-Uruguayan trade relations. However, "developing trade with China" is the mountain-like will of the people of all strata in Uruguay, and it is difficult to obstruct.

If the original meaning of Montevideo is "I see a mountain," then the "mountain" I saw in Montevideo is the "mountain"-like will of the Uruguayan people. (Attached photo)

    我所看到的一座“山”
    ——蒙得维的亚忆语
    访南美中国艺术团副团长  王力
    当我们乘坐的飞机开始降落的时候，我们看见一座像馒头似的小山，伸出在拉巴拉他河口，这就是乌拉圭的首都蒙得维的亚。
    下了飞机，见到乌拉圭议会议员法林拉先生。他彬彬有礼地递了一张印着“乌拉圭驻北京商务代表”的名片，同时带来一大卷报纸，这些报纸上都刊载着他访问中国商谈贸易归国后的讲演。
    法林拉先生是中国艺术团在乌拉圭演出的组织者。从一见面，法林拉先生就一直热心地谈论着开展乌中贸易的话题。
    艺术团上演的剧院叫“索德雷”。“索德雷”是乌拉圭政府管理文化艺术广播事业的委员会。“索德雷”主席加保罗夫人在她的家里亲切地接待了艺术团的领导人。
    加保罗夫人热心地介绍乌拉圭的国家领导人物与艺术团领导人相见。
    在艺术团首次公演的休息时间，乌拉圭国务会议的领导人之一、红徽党多数派领袖巴特莱·柏莱斯接见了我们。
    第二天，这位体格魁梧、面部表情严肃的乌拉圭政治家又在主席府正式接见了我们。
    巴特莱·柏莱斯代表他的国家，把一个乌拉圭的国徽，赠送给中国艺术团。
    巴特莱·柏莱斯表示愿意发展乌中两国的文化关系。他不仅对中国的古典戏剧和音乐感到兴趣，还特别愿意知道中国的现代音乐，他希望能得到中国唱片。
    巴特莱·柏莱斯还表明他和他的政府更关心的是发展乌中贸易关系的问题，他说：“发展乌中贸易，对于乌拉圭，是非常重要的。”
    巴特莱·柏莱斯还说道：“乌拉圭和中国也应该发展政治联系”。
    巴特莱·柏莱斯几次打消客人告辞的意思。他对中国客人赠送的礼品以至名片上的中国字也感到兴趣，他又询问中国文字改革的情况，他说他近年来产生了学习中文的愿望。
    他召来了摄影师，同我们一起照了相，并说：明天在旅馆里就可以收到这张他亲笔签名的合影。
    乌拉圭政府是联邦国务会议制度。国务委员的成员三分之二为红徽党，三分之一为白徽党。国务会议主席由红徽党委员轮流担任，每次任期一年。本届第一任主席是巴特莱·柏莱斯，今年轮到苏维里亚。
    苏维里亚主席和他的政府的外交部长、教育部长，参议院和众议院的议长，蒙得维的亚的市长都分别接见了中国艺术团的领导人，他们异口同声地表示愿意和中国发展贸易关系。
    在伸在拉巴拉他河口的那座小山上，有一家乌拉圭国家屠宰工场。场长马拉葛来巴先生是一位胖胖的、精明的商人，他殷勤地引导艺术团团员仔细参观工场的每一个部分。这家工场的设备是比较陈旧的，但是这位乌拉圭人怀着民族主义的信心同对门那家美资经营的近代化设备的屠宰场竞争。场长先生请我们遍尝这家工厂出产的罐头，他急切地希望这些产品能够卖到中国和其它社会主义国家去。
    这个国家的经济是以畜牧业为中心的。每人平均有三头牛、六头羊。全国人口的将近二分之一，共一百多万人集中在蒙得维的亚。这个城市也主要是为畜产品加工服务的，同时是一个吞吐的港口。
    这个被人们称做“美洲的瑞士”的国家，由于历史的和其他的条件曾经得天独厚地处在天涯的一角，过着宁静的生活。
    第二次世界大战以后的十多年来，特别是近三年来，美国资本像一个“妖魔”，把这个宁静的国家的经济生活弄到“山穷水尽”的地步。畜产品被断绝了销路，许多工厂倒闭了，或是处在半关闭状态，大量工人处于失业和半失业的境地，素以稳定著称的乌拉圭比索，过去九角六分钱换一美元，现在要四元八角钱才能换到一美元。
    具有民族独立和民主自由传统的乌拉圭人民，以及乌拉圭当政的政治家和商人由于他们今天的处境，因而急切地寻觅出路的心情，人们是容易理解的。
    全乌拉圭，只有以“白报”为代表的极少数亲美的大金融资本家在阻挠乌中发展贸易关系。但是，“对中国开展贸易”，是乌拉圭各阶层人民如山的意志，是难以阻挠的。
    如果说，蒙得维的亚原来的字义是“我看见一座山”，那么，我在蒙得维的亚所看到的一座“山”，便是乌拉圭人的这种如“山”的意志。（附图片）
