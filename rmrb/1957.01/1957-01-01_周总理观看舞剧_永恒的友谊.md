Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 29th — (Delayed dispatch) Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage watched the dance drama "Eternal Friendship" at the Gulistan Hall tonight. They repeatedly applauded enthusiastically for the drama's moving plot and its praise of friendship with the Chinese people.
　　This traditional Pakistani dance drama was the main program in a cultural performance held by the Pakistan-China Friendship Association to welcome the Chinese guests' visit to Dhaka. Other programs of the evening included typical folk songs and folk band performances.
　　"Eternal Friendship" tells the story of a Chinese monk seeking knowledge who visited happy people in ancient times. The people blessed him with the lotus of wisdom. But later, a nakedly profit-driven person sneaked into their country and enslaved them for two hundred years.
　　Finally, the people united and revolted, driving away the plunderers. As they resumed their happy life and celebrated jubilantly, another monk from China came to visit them, bringing messages of friendship, peace, and happiness.
　　Before the cultural performance, Maulana Bhashani, founder of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, and Ataur Rahman, chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association and Chief Minister of East Pakistan, successively delivered enthusiastic welcoming speeches. Premier Zhou Enlai said in his reply: "I am very pleased to see that the Pakistani people have achieved new achievements in respecting their national culture and making this culture serve the needs of current life."
　　At the end of the cultural performance, Zhou Enlai, Suhrawardy, and Bhashani all went on stage to shake hands with the artists, and gifts were exchanged between the guests and hosts.
　　The gifts presented to Premier Zhou Enlai by the Pakistan-China Friendship Association included a stone inlaid with gold nuggets, on which was engraved in Bengali: Sino-Pakistani friendship is as solid as a rock and as precious as gold; in addition, there was a shell carved by a famous Pakistani artist, as well as Pakistan's famous cotton silk. Premier Zhou Enlai presented some Chinese handicrafts to the hosts.
　　Before the Chinese guests left the hall, it was announced that Premier Zhou Enlai had donated 70,000 rupees to relieve the flood in East Pakistan, which aroused enthusiastic cheers. Earlier, Premier Zhou Enlai had donated 20,000 rupees as a welfare fund for students and faculty of Dhaka University.
　　Before and after the performance, cheers resounded throughout the hall, shouting slogans such as "Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship!" and "Long live world peace!"
　　Earlier this evening, Premier Zhou Enlai and his party attended a banquet held in an exquisitely decorated garden at the invitation of the Chief Minister of East Pakistan. A fireworks display was watched before the banquet.
　　The East Pakistan government and the reception committee also presented Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage with exquisite Dhaka handicrafts, including silver carvings, cotton silk rolls, and ivory carvings.

    周总理观看舞剧“永恒的友谊”
    新华社达卡29日电　（迟到）周恩来总理和随行人员今天晚上在古里斯坦大厅观看舞剧“永恒的友谊”。他们一再为舞剧的动人情节和它所歌颂的同中国人民的友谊热烈鼓掌。
    这个巴基斯坦传统舞剧是巴中友好协会为欢迎中国客人们访问达卡而举行的文艺演出中的主要节目。晚会的其他节目有典型的民歌和民间乐队的演奏。
      “永恒的友谊”是讲述古时候一个求学问的中国僧人访问幸福的人民的故事。人民用智慧之莲为他祝福。但是后来有一个赤裸裸的唯利是图的人钻进了他们的国家，把他们奴役了两百年。
    最后，人民终于团结一致起来反抗，赶走了掠夺者。当他们重新过幸福的生活和兴高采烈庆祝的时候，又有一个从中国来的僧人前来访问他们，并且带来了友谊、和平和幸福的信息。
      在举行文艺演出以前，巴中友好协会发起人大毛拉巴沙尼和巴
  中友好协会主席、东巴基斯坦首席部长阿陶尔·拉赫曼相继发表了热诚的欢迎词。周恩来总理在致答词的时候说：“我很高兴地看到巴基斯坦人民在尊重本国文化和使这种文化为当前生活的需要服务方面已经获得新的成就。”
    文艺演出结束的时候，周恩来、苏拉瓦底和巴沙尼一齐登上舞
  台同艺术家们握手，宾主间还交换了礼物。
      巴中友好协会送给周恩来总理的礼物中有一块嵌有金块的石头上面用孟加拉文刻着：中巴友谊坚如磐石，贵如黄金；此外还有巴基斯坦一位著名艺术家雕刻的贝壳以及巴基斯坦名产棉绸。周恩来总理把一些中国工艺品赠送给主人。
    在中国客人们还没有离开大厅以前，有人宣布：周恩来总理捐助了七万卢比救济东巴基斯坦水灾，这个消息引起了热烈的欢呼。早些时候，周恩来总理曾经捐助二万卢比作为达卡大学学生和教职员福利基金。
    在演出前后，大厅都响起了一阵阵的欢呼声，高呼“中巴友好津达巴（万岁）！”“世界和平津达巴！”等口号。
    今晚早些时候，周恩来总理一行应东巴基斯坦首席部长的邀请出席了在布置得极其雅致的花园里举行的宴会。宴会前观看了焰火表演。
    东巴基斯坦政府和招待委员会也向周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员赠送了达卡的精美手工艺品，其中有银雕刻品、棉绸卷布和象牙雕刻品。
