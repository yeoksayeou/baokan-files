Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 19th. Many agricultural cooperatives in Zhejiang Province have recently been seriously studying the issue of improving the quality of farm work while summarizing their production in 1956.

According to many agricultural cooperatives, although the labor attendance rate was very high in last year's agricultural production, the farm work was generally done roughly. This is mainly because some agricultural cooperatives were established not long ago and lacked management experience. They did not establish a production responsibility system well—a series of systems such as contracting work, contracting output, contracting costs, and piece-rate wages—or there were problems in implementing these systems. Yuyao County is an old double-cropping rice area that has always been known for its intensive cultivation. Due to the general decline in the quality of farm work last year, it has aroused dissatisfaction among farmers. They said: "Advanced cooperation can increase production, but poor farm work reduces it by half." The Fourth Agricultural Cooperative of Xiaodong Township in Yuyao County, due to the lack of a sound system of contracting output and costs, not only had low-quality farm work, but also suffered serious losses of farm tools. Last year, the repair costs of farm tools alone cost more than 2,000 yuan. In addition, the work points were set unreasonably. Heavy work with few work points was done very roughly. Coupled with the lack of political and ideological education and strict implementation of operational technical education for the members, some members, in order to earn more work points during labor, did not consider the quality of farm work and technical requirements.

After analyzing and studying the reasons for the low quality of farm work, many agricultural cooperatives unanimously realized that in the future, the production responsibility system within the cooperative should be established and improved, and the collective responsibility system should be closely combined with the individual technical operation responsibility system, and the collective interests should be combined with the individual interests of the members. This requires in-depth democratic discussions on various systems such as contracting work, contracting output, contracting costs, and piece-rate wages, and the determination of appropriate reward and compensation systems. In order to strengthen the operational responsibilities of its members and improve the quality of farm work, the Xinqiao Agricultural Cooperative of Hang County re-arranged and revised the various contents and indicators such as contracting work, contracting output, contracting costs, and piece-rate wages in winter production. As a result, the production enthusiasm of the members was greatly stimulated, and the quality of farm work was significantly improved.

    怎样才能提高农活质量
    浙江许多农业社都认真进行了研究
    新华社杭州19日电　浙江省很多农业社最近在总结1956年的生产时，都认真地研究了提高农活质量的问题。
    据很多农业社反映，在去年的农业生产中，劳动出勤率虽然很高，但是农活一般做得比较粗糙。这主要是由于有些农业社建立不久，缺乏管理经验，没有很好地建立起生产责任制——包工、包产、包成本、按件计酬等一系列的制度，或者是在实行这些制度中有问题。余姚县是一个一向被称为精耕细作的老连作稻区，由于去年农活质量普遍下降，引起了农民的不满，他们说：“高级合作能增产，农活不好减一半。”余姚县肖东乡第四农业社由于没有健全的包产、包成本的制度，不仅农活的质量不高，农具的损失也很严重，去年仅农具修理费就花了两千多元。另外，工分订得不合理，做重活而工分少的就做得很粗糙。加上对社员缺乏政治思想教育和严格执行操作技术的教育，以致一部分社员在劳动中为了多挣工分，而不考虑农活的质量和技术要求。
    许多农业社在分析研究了农活质量不高的原因以后，一致认识到今后要把社内的生产责任制建立和健全起来，并且要使集体责任制和个人技术操作责任制密切地结合起来，把集体的利益和社员的个人利益结合起来，这就要对包工、包产、包成本、按件计酬等各种制度进行深入的民主的讨论，并且确定适当的奖赔制度。杭县新桥农业社为了加强社员的操作责任、提高农活的质量，在冬季生产中把包工、包产、包成本、按件计酬等各项内容和指标重新作了安排和修改。这样做的结果，大大发挥了社员的生产积极性，显著地提高了农活的质量。
