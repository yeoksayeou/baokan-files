Comrade Milenko, dear comrades and friends!

Thank you for your kind reception and warm welcome, and thank you for the deep friendship you have for the Chinese people. At the same time, I would like to convey, on behalf of our delegation, the deep friendship and fraternal greetings of the Chinese people to you.

The people of China and Yugoslavia, socialist brothers, have a long-standing friendship. Just as you care about and pay attention to our revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, we have always cared about and paid attention to your revolutionary struggle and socialist construction. As far back as the years of the anti-fascist struggle, we gave each other deep sympathy and concern, and gave each other encouragement and support. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have been continuously enhanced and developed. Our two countries have repeatedly sent delegations to each other for friendly visits, which has played a great role in enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between us and strengthening our unity. During the visit of our National People's Congress delegation and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee delegation, we visited your factories, rural areas, and scientific and cultural institutions, had cordial talks with many leading comrades from all aspects of Yugoslavia, learned about many aspects of your work, saw your various great achievements in socialist construction, saw the vigorous and hardworking efforts of your cadres and people for socialist construction, learned some of your work experience, and further deepened the mutual understanding between us. I believe that this will enhance the fraternal friendship between us and strengthen our unity.

Comrades, our unity and cooperation is strength. In order to stop the war provocations of the imperialist aggressive blocs and safeguard world peace, for the great cause of socialism, in order to smoothly overcome various difficulties in building our respective countries, and to gradually improve the people's lives on the basis of developing production, we need to strengthen the unity between China and Yugoslavia, strengthen the unity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and strengthen the unity between socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples. As long as the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism throughout the world unite, the cause of world peace and human progress will be guaranteed.

Among all our socialist countries, we have the common cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, the common goals of struggle, and the interlinked interests. We have Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism as the guide for our actions. We all advocate that all countries handle their mutual affairs in accordance with the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Unity and cooperation built on such a foundation are not only completely justified, but also possible. It not only conforms to the interests of the people of China and Yugoslavia, but also conforms to the interests of the people of all socialist countries and the international proletariat, as well as the interests of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. But this does not mean that there will be no differences in views on certain issues between our fraternal countries and fraternal parties. No, if there are still different opinions within a party and within a country, it is not surprising that there are different opinions on certain issues between fraternal parties and fraternal countries. However, the same opinions are often fundamental and primary; among us Communists and socialist brother countries, different opinions are often smaller and secondary compared to the same opinions. At the same time, on the basis of the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, and on the basis of the common interests of the world proletariat, starting from unity, and through realistic, calm, scientific, and comradely discussion and research, differences in opinion should be able to reach consensus. Even if there are temporarily some different arguments, it does not matter, we can seek consensus in continued exploration. We Chinese people are willing to work with the people of all fraternal countries to make every possible effort to continuously strengthen our unity.

I propose a toast,

    To the health of Chairman Milenko and all the comrades present,
    To the prosperity and happiness of the people of all nationalities in Yugoslavia,
    To the friendship between the people of China and Yugoslavia,
    To the health of Comrade Tito, President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia!

### 彭真的讲话

    彭真的讲话亲爱的马林科同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    感谢你们对我们的亲切的接待和热烈的欢迎，感谢你们对中国人民的深厚友谊。同时我也以我们的代表团的名义转达中国人民对你们的深厚友谊和兄弟的问候。
    社会主义的兄弟的中南两国的人民是有着长期的友谊的。正如你们关心和注视着我们的革命斗争和社会主义建设一样，我们也一向关心和注视着你们的革命斗争和社会主义建设。远在过去反法西斯斗争的年月里，我们就相互寄予了深厚的同情和关切，相互给予了鼓舞和支持。自从我们两国建立邦交以来，两国的友好合作关系在不断地增进和发展。我们两国都曾经多次相互派遣了代表团进行友好访问，它对增进我们之间的相互了解和友谊，对加强我们之间的团结，已经起了很大的作用。这次我们全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团在访问过程中，参观了你们的工厂、农村和科学文化机关，同南斯拉夫各方面的许多领导同志进行了亲切交谈，了解了你们许多工作情况，看到了你们在社会主义建设中的各种巨大成就，看到了你们的干部和人民为社会主义建设的朝气勃勃的辛勤努力，学习了你们的一些工作经验，进一步加深了我们之间的相互了解。我相信，这会增进我们之间的兄弟友谊，加强我们之间的团结。
    同志们，我们的团结合作就是力量，为了制止帝国主义侵略集团的战争挑衅以维护世界的和平，为了社会主义的伟大事业，为了顺利地克服各种困难建设各自的国家，并且在发展生产的基础上逐步改善人民的生活，我们都需要加强中南两国的团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的团结，加强社会主义国家同一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结。只要全世界和平、民主、社会主义力量团结起来，世界和平和人类进步的事业就有了保证。
    我们所有社会主义国家之间有着和平、民主、社会主义的共同事业，共同奋斗的目标和休戚相关的利害关系，有着马克思列宁主义，有着无产阶级国际主义作为行动的指针。我们都主张一切国家之间都按照互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则处理相互间的事务。建立在这样基础上的团结合作不但是完全应该的，而且是可能的。它不但符合于中南两国人民的利益，也符合于社会主义各国人民和国际无产阶级以及全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的利益。但是这并不是说，在我们兄弟国家和兄弟党之间不会对若干问题的看法有这样或者那样的分歧。不是的，如果在一个党内和一个国家内还会有这样或者那样的不同意见的话，在兄弟党和兄弟国家之间对若干问题有这样或者那样的不同意见是不足为奇的。可是，相同的意见往往是根本的、主要的；在我们共产党人和社会主义的兄弟国家之间，不同的意见比起相同的意见来说，往往是比较小的和次要的。同时，在马克思列宁主义的根本原则、在世界无产阶级的共同利益的基础上，从团结出发，经过实事求是地冷静的科学的同志式的讨论和研究，不同意见应该是可以取得一致的。即便暂时有若干论点不同也并不要紧，可以在继续探讨中求得一致。我们中国人民愿意同各兄弟国家人民一道，为不断地加强我们的团结尽一切可能的努力。
    我提议举杯，
    为主席马林科同志和所有在座的同志们的健康，
    为南斯拉夫各族人民的繁荣和幸福，
    为中南两国人民的友谊，
    为南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托同志的健康干杯！
