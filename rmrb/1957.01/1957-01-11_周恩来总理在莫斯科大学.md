    Premier Zhou Enlai at Moscow University
    Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He
    At a little after 3:00 PM on January 9th, the sky was overcast with low clouds, making Moscow University, standing tall on Lenin Hills, seem even higher into the clouds. Inside the main entrance gathered Moscow University Rector Academician Petrovsky, Soviet Deputy Minister of Higher Education Stoletov, and Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin, as well as faculty, staff, and students. In addition, there were dozens of news reporters and photographers from the Soviet Union, People's Democratic countries, and capitalist countries. They were all waiting for the arrival of Premier Zhou Enlai.
    At 3:30 PM, Zhou Enlai, He Long, Wang Jiaxiang, and their entourage and translators arrived. The hosts ceremoniously opened the main door, warmly shook hands with the envoys of People's China, and led them to the Rector's office. The crowd in the corridor, eager to see Premier Zhou and other Chinese representatives, grew larger and larger, only clearing a path when Premier Zhou approached.
    In the Rector's office, at Premier Zhou Enlai's request, Rector Petrovsky provided a detailed introduction to Moscow University. Premier Zhou Enlai asked: How many Chinese students are studying here? The Rector replied: Approximately five hundred undergraduates and one hundred and twenty postgraduates. Premier Zhou Enlai said with a smile: Still too few, there should be more. The Rector said: We are very happy to have Chinese students studying here, we are satisfied with their performance, and we believe that excellent scientists will emerge from among them. The cordial conversation continued. Petrovsky mentioned that Moscow University has over eighteen thousand students and one thousand eight hundred faculty members. Premier Zhou Enlai said: China does not yet have such a powerful university. Peking University still feels that there are not enough professors and lecturers. Premier Zhou Enlai also inquired about the number of classrooms and laboratories, and the accommodation for students and faculty. The hosts answered all these questions one by one.
    Everyone rose to leave the Rector's office. Suddenly, they saw a realistic panoramic view of Moscow University hanging on the wall. Academician Petrovsky introduced it as a Chinese silk embroidery, presented by Peking University to Moscow University in commemoration of its bicentennial.
    Next, the hosts led the guests to the Geological Museum on the twenty-seventh floor. It exhibited numerous mineral specimens and geological maps, reflecting the richness of Soviet mineral resources. Everyone was particularly interested in the diverse and dazzling Ural ores. Then, the delegation visited the Geology Department's laboratories, classrooms, library, reading room, and visited room number 465 of the undergraduate dormitory, where Yu Wenxia from China and Nelya Melnikova from the Soviet Union lived. Wherever the guests went, they received enthusiastic receptions from students and faculty. After the visit, the Chinese guests were led to the Great Hall. On the wall of the lounge at the entrance of the Great Hall, among the portraits of world-renowned scientists inlaid with colored stones, were also the portraits of Zu Chongzhi and Li Shizhen, attracting the attention of the guests.
    When Premier Zhou Enlai and other Chinese representatives stepped into the Great Hall, the young students and faculty who had been waiting for a long time livened up. The cheers of "Hurrah" were deafening, and thousands of hands enthusiastically applauded like a rainstorm.
    This hall has one thousand five hundred seats and is one of the few large auditoriums in Moscow. Now, even the three sides of the corridors and the middle aisle were crowded, with more than two thousand five hundred people. At this moment, everyone's heart was inclined towards the representatives of People's China. As they walked past the people, Chekhaniv, a student from the Economics Department, led a group of Soviet students in greeting in Chinese: "Ni hao!" This sentence was learned from Chinese classmates just a few minutes before.
    The conference was opened by Rector Petrovsky. On behalf of all the faculty and students, he expressed a warm welcome to Premier Zhou Enlai and other Chinese representatives, and excitedly announced that the Academic Committee of Moscow University had unanimously decided to award the title of Honorary Doctor of Law of Moscow University to the outstanding Chinese statesman, Premier Zhou Enlai, for his outstanding contributions to international law and national law. At this time, the entire audience stood up, shouting "Hurrah," and a long-lasting applause rang out. Then, Academician Petrovsky awarded Premier Zhou Enlai the honorary doctorate certificate. Two Soviet female students and two Chinese female students went on stage to present flowers in tribute. Academician Petrovsky also presented Zhou Enlai, He Long, and Wang Jiaxiang with a Moscow University bicentennial commemorative medal and a copy of "History of Moscow University" each.
    Then, the head of the Law Department, Kolev, and student representative Derenin, successively delivered congratulatory speeches, expressing that Soviet-Chinese friendship is profound and unbreakable. Hu Zongpei, the representative of Chinese students studying at Moscow University, also spoke, saying that Chinese students here have received thoughtful care from Soviet teachers and students, and they promised to study hard, overcome complacency and great-power chauvinism, strengthen friendship with Soviet and other foreign students, and live up to the expectations of the motherland.
    Finally, the conference warmly welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's speech. His speech touched the hearts of the attendees in many places, eliciting waves of applause. He spoke with admirable humility, saying: "You have awarded me an honorary degree, which is not only my personal honor, but also the honor of the Chinese people. My own knowledge and ability are far from sufficient, and I am not worthy of accepting such an honorable degree. But I regard this kindness as an encouragement and spur to me. I will study and work harder for world peace and for our common communist cause." People were particularly excited to hear these words. A Soviet youth standing behind me said: "Excellent!"
    The faculty and students of Moscow University saw off the Chinese representatives led by Premier Zhou Enlai. As they left Lenin Hills, the tall but not towering, broad but not scattered buildings of Moscow University still stood grandly and simply. This institution of learning, full of internationalist spirit, besides educating Chinese children studying abroad, seemed particularly close to the Chinese people today because it awarded Premier Zhou Enlai an honorary degree.

    周恩来总理在莫斯科大学
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    1月9日下午三点多钟，天阴云低，矗立在列宁山上的莫斯科大学更显得高入云际。在正面大门内聚集着莫斯科大学校长彼得罗夫斯基院士、苏联高等教育部副部长斯托列托夫和苏联驻我国大使尤金，以及教职员和学生。此外还有苏联、人民民主国家和资本主义国家的几十个新闻记者和摄影记者。他们都在等待着周恩来总理的到来。
    三点半钟，周恩来、贺龙、王稼祥和随员、翻译们到了。主人隆重地打开了正面的大门，和人民中国的使者们亲热地握手，把他们引到校长办公室去。走廊上争看周总理和其他中国代表的人们越聚越多，只在周总理走到跟前的时候，才让开一条路。
    在校长办公室里，彼得罗夫斯基校长应周恩来总理的请求，详细地介绍了莫斯科大学的情况。周恩来总理问：有多少中国留学生在这里学习。校长答：约有五百名大学生和一百二十名研究生。周恩来总理含笑地说：还少，还要多些。校长说：我们很高兴有中国学生在这里学习，我们满意他们的成绩，我们觉得从他们当中将会成长出优秀的科学家。亲切的谈话继续着。彼得罗夫斯基谈到莫斯科大学有一万八千多学生和一千八百教职员。周恩来总理说：中国还没有这样力量雄厚的大学，北京大学还感到教授和讲师不够。周恩来总理也关心课堂和实验室的数目，学生和教职员的住处。所有这些问题，主人都一一作答了。
    大家起身，准备离开校长室了。忽然看到墙上挂的一幅逼真的莫斯科大学全景。彼得罗夫斯基院士介绍说，那是中国的丝绣，是北京大学赠给莫斯科大学以纪念它的二百周年的。
    接着，主人把客人带到二十七层楼上的地质博物馆。这里展览着众多的矿物标本和地质图解，它们反映了苏联矿藏的丰富。大家对于种类繁多、光耀夺目的乌拉尔矿石特别感兴趣。然后，代表团参观了地质系的实验室、课堂、图书馆、阅览室，访问了大学生宿舍的四百六十五号房间，那里住着从中国来的于文霞和苏联的涅里雅·麦尔尼科娃。客人们不论走到哪里，都受到学生和教职员的热诚的接待。在参观以后，中国客人们被领到大礼堂去。在大礼堂门口休息室的壁上，用采色石块镶成的世界著名科学家的肖像中，也有祖冲之和李时珍的肖像，引起客人们的注意。
    当周恩来总理和其他中国代表踏进大礼堂的时候，礼堂里盼望许久的青年学生们和教职员们都活跃起来了。“乌拉”的欢呼声震耳欲聋，几千双手起劲地鼓起骤雨般的掌声。
    这里有一千五百个座位，是莫斯科市少有的大礼堂。现在连三面走廊和当中过道都挤得水泄不通，足足有二千五百人以上。人们的心此刻都倾向人民中国的代表们。当他们走过人们面前的时候，经济系学生切哈尼夫带领一批苏联学生用中国语问候：“您好！”这句话是几分钟前才向中国同学学来的。
    大会由彼得罗夫斯基校长主持开幕了。他代表全校师生表示热忱欢迎周恩来总理和其他中国代表们，并且兴奋地宣布说，莫斯科大学学术委员会一致决定，授给中国杰出的政治家周恩来总理以莫斯科大学名誉法学博士的称号。因为他对国际法和国家法有卓越的贡献。这时，全场都站起来，喊着“乌拉”，同时响起经久不息地鼓掌。于是，彼得罗夫斯基院士授给周恩来总理名誉博士学位证书。两个苏联女学生和两个中国女学生上台献了鲜花致敬。彼得罗夫斯基院士还赠给周恩来、贺龙、王稼祥每人各一枚莫斯科大学二百周年纪念章和各一部“莫斯科大学历史。”
    然后，法律系主任柯列夫和学生代表杰列宁相继致词祝贺，表示苏中友谊是深厚和牢不可破的。在莫斯科大学学习的中国留学生代表胡宗培也讲了话，他说，中国留学生在这里受到苏联师生的周到的关怀，他们保证努力学习，克服自满和大国主义的情绪，加强与苏联和其他各国同学的友谊，不辜负祖国的愿望。
    最后，大会热烈地欢迎周恩来总理演说。他的演说在许多地方打动与会者们的心，引起一阵又一阵的鼓掌。他以令人感动的谦虚的态度讲了这一段话：“你们授给我名誉学位，这不仅是我个人的光荣，也是中国人民的光荣。我自己的知识和能力都很不够，对接受这种荣誉的学位，是不相称的。但我将这种好意看成是对我的鼓励和督促。我将为了世界和平，为了我们共同的共产主义事业，更加努力地学习和工作”。人们听了这番话特别兴奋。一位站在我背后的苏联青年说：“好极了！”
    莫斯科大学的师生们送走了以周恩来总理为首的中国代表们。当他们离开列宁山的时候，莫斯科大学高而不耸、广而不散的大楼依然伟大而朴素地矗立着。这个充满国际主义精神的学府，除了教育留学的中国儿女以外，今天又因为授给周恩来总理名誉学位而显得对中国人民格外亲切了。
