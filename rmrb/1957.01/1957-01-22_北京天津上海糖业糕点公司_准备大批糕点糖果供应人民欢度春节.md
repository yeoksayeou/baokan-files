Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai Sugar and Pastry Companies
Prepare Large Quantities of Pastries and Candies to Supply the People for a Joyous Spring Festival

(Our newspaper dispatch) To ensure that the people of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have a good Spring Festival, the sugar and pastry companies of these three major cities have prepared large quantities of pastry and food products. These three cities are preparing to supply approximately 8,000 tons of sugar before and after the Spring Festival, an increase of about 20% compared to last year. Among them, 1,900 tons will be brown sugar.

The demand for pastries and candies is very high during the holidays. These three cities are preparing to supply a total of 3.83 million jin of Chinese and Western-style pastries, biscuits, cakes, etc., during the Spring Festival, an increase of about 10% compared to last year. Beijing has also arranged for the production of 210,000 jin of bread and 1.3 million jin of New Year cakes. Beijing and Tianjin will have more than 2.7 million jin of Yuanxiao (sweet rice dumplings) available, concentrated for supply during the festival. These three cities are preparing to supply a total of 4 million jin of various hard and soft candies, an increase of about 15% compared to last year. In Beijing, the popular southern candies and Guandong candies will also be supplied in large quantities during the Spring Festival. In addition, these three cities also plan to supply nearly 500,000 cans of canned goods during the Spring Festival.

During the holidays, the supply of milk powder will also be increased to some extent. Due to the small output and large demand for milk powder, it is temporarily difficult to organize a large supply of goods, but the production of substitute milk powder has been expanded.

    北京天津上海糖业糕点公司
    准备大批糕点糖果供应人民欢度春节
    本报讯　北京、天津、上海三大城市的糖业糕点公司，为使这些城市的人民过好春节，已准备了大量的糕点食品。这三个城市在春节前后准备供应的食糖约有八千吨，比去年增加了20％左右。其中有红糖一千九百吨。
    糕点、糖果，在节日的需要量很大。这三个城市准备在春节期间供应的中西式糕点、饼干、蛋糕等共计三百八十三万斤，比去年约增加10％左右。北京市还安排了二十一万斤面包和一百三十万斤年糕的生产。京、津两地将有二百七十多万斤元宵，集中在节日里供应。这三个城市准备供应的各种软硬糖果共有四百万斤之多，约比去年增加15％。在北京，很受人们欢迎的南糖和关东糖，也将在春节大量供应。此外，这三个城市还计划在春节供应近五十万听罐头。
    在节日里，奶粉的供应量也将有所增加。因奶粉产量小、需要量大，组织大量的货源暂时尚有困难，已扩大安排了代乳粉的生产。
