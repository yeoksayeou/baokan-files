Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 13th: The Chongqing Transportation Company plans to increase its freight volume by 2.72 million ton-kilometers and save 120,000 liters of gasoline this year without adding any vehicles.

This production increase and conservation target was established by the company through criticizing past one-sidedness and tapping into potential strengths.

Last year, in the "Safe and Economical 100,000 Kilometers Without Overhaul" campaign, the company focused solely on increasing the number of vehicles achieving 100,000 kilometers without overhaul, fostering a one-sided mentality among drivers. Some vehicles that should have been repaired in a timely manner were not, and vehicles that should have been maintained were neglected, resulting in good vehicles deteriorating and bad ones worsening. In the second quarter of last year alone, 32 out of the company's 108 vehicles underwent major repairs, and 8 underwent intermediate repairs as a result. The mileage of these vehicles only reached 70% to 80% of the prescribed mileage. Recently, when the company studied production increase and conservation, it decided to implement a system of seven drivers for six vehicles in response to this situation, in order to ensure that drivers have ample time to strengthen vehicle maintenance. At the same time, a system of fixed vehicle assignments for drivers will be implemented, enabling them to become more familiar with the vehicle's performance, facilitating vehicle maintenance, and extending the vehicle's lifespan.

In the past, the company only focused on mobilizing drivers and maintenance workers for production increase and conservation, neglecting to mobilize technical personnel and staff, resulting in management work lagging behind production. Now, having learned this lesson, they have decided to launch in-depth business competitions among technical personnel and staff, so that they can also be involved in the production increase and conservation campaign.

The company has also strengthened economic investigation work, organizing more than a dozen cadres to thoroughly review the transportation plans of various consigning units, effectively clarifying the flow and direction of goods, in order to organize dedicated line transportation and counter-current transportation to improve the utilization rate of existing equipment.

### 重庆运输公司  不添车多运货少用油

    重庆运输公司
    不添车多运货少用油
    据新华社重庆13日电　重庆运输公司今年将在不增添车辆的情况下，增加运量二百七十二万吨公里，节约汽油十二万公升。
    这个增产节约指标，是公司从批判过去的片面性和挖掘潜在力量过程中订出来的。
    这个公司去年在“安全节约十万公里无大修”运动中，只片面地要求多出现一些十万公里无大修的汽车，助长了驾驶员的片面思想。有些车子该及时修理的不修，该保养的不保养，结果好车拖成坏车，坏的拖得更坏。单是去年第二季度全公司一百零八辆汽车中，就有三十二辆汽车因此进行了大修，八辆汽车进行了中修。这些车子行驶的里程，只达到规定行驶里程的70％到80％。公司最近研究增产节约的时候，针对这种情况，决定实行六辆汽车七个驾驶员的办法，以便保证司机能有充裕的时间加强对汽车的保养，同时实行司机固定用车的办法，使他们更能熟悉车的性能，便于对汽车进行保养，延长汽车的寿命。
    过去公司搞增产节约只注意发动驾驶员和保养工人，忽视发动技术人员和职员，因此形成管理工作落后于生产。现在，他们接受这个教训，决定在技术人员和职员中深入开展同业务竞赛，使他们也能卷入增产节约运动中来。
    公司还加强了经济调查工作，组织了十几名干部详细审查各托运单位的运输计划，切实摸清货源的流量和流向，以便组织专线运输、对流运输来提高现有设备的利用率。
