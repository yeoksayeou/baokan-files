Editor's Note: Recently, many Party and government leading organs, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have begun to streamline the upper levels and strengthen the lower levels. However, some people doubt: if this continues level by level, will the grassroots organizational structure become even more massive? This issue is indeed worth noting. In order to solve this problem, the method adopted by Ji'an Special District in Jiangxi Province to properly arrange the original grassroots cadres according to their specific circumstances after transferring a large number of cadres to the grassroots level is worth considering.

    This newspaper reports: The organs of Ji'an Special District in Jiangxi Province and its subordinate counties are transferring a large number of staff to counties and townships to strengthen the grassroots leadership. According to preliminary statistics, more than 1,200 cadres from the special district and county levels have been or are being transferred, including 74 from various departments of the CPC Ji'an Prefectural Committee and Ji'an local mass organizations. Among the cadres transferred from various units, some are ministers and section chiefs of the special district or prefectural committee and county-level leading cadres. After they are transferred to the counties and townships, more than 90% of the counties in the entire special district will have prefectural committee-level cadres concurrently serving as county party secretaries, more than 30% of the townships will have county-level cadres assisting in the work, and each township will have an average of three to five or more district-level cadres. Some of the transferred cadres will also assume leadership positions in agricultural cooperatives, which will greatly strengthen the grassroots leadership in rural areas.

    The departments of the special district and counties have been appropriately merged, and some overlapping institutions have been abolished. For example, the CPC Ji'an Prefectural Committee has merged the Propaganda Department and the Culture and Education Department into the Propaganda and Education Department; the Finance and Trade Department has been abolished, and the Finance Committee organizational form has been restored to lead financial and economic work.

    After a large number of cadres are transferred to lower levels, where will the original township cadres go? The CPC Ji'an Prefectural Committee has instructed all counties that the original township cadres should be properly arranged based on their work ability, physical strength, personal requirements, and other factors, after education and mobilization: most township cadres can return to the cooperatives where they live, serve as agricultural cooperative branch secretaries, and change to part-time work, participating in cooperative production and earning work points from the cooperative; some township cadres will remain in the township to work; some will voluntarily change their occupation and return home to production, receiving a certain amount of retirement pay.

    江西吉安专区加强基层组织
    大批干部下调到乡
    原有乡干部将分别情况妥善处理
    编者按：近来，不少党、政领导机关根据党的八届二中全会的精神，已经开始精简上层充实下层。可是有人怀疑：这样一级一级往下挤，基层组织机构岂不又要庞大起来了吗？这个问题的确值得注意。为了解决这个问题，江西吉安专区在把大批干部调到基层以后，对原有的基层干部采取的分别情况妥善安排的办法是值得参考的。
    本报讯　江西省吉安专区和所属县的机关，正将大批工作人员下调到县、乡，充实基层领导力量。据初步统计，目前已经或正在下调的专区和县的干部共有一千二百多人，其中中共吉安地委的各部门和吉安地方群众团体有七十四人。各单位下调的干部中有一些是专区或地委的部长和科长级以及县级的领导干部。他们调到县、乡以后，全专区将有90％以上的县有地委级干部兼任县委书记，30％以上的乡有县级干部帮助工作，每乡平均可以有三个到五个以上的区级干部。有一些下调的干部还要担任农业社的领导工作，这样农村基层领导力量将大大加强。
    专区和县的各部门都适当地进行了合并，并且撤销了一部分重叠的机构。如中共吉安地委已经把宣传部与文教部合并为宣教部；撤销财贸部，恢复财委组织形式来领导财经工作。
    大批干部下放以后，原有乡干部到那里去呢？中共吉安地委已经指示各县，对原有的乡干部，应根据工作能力、身体强弱、个人要求等情况，经过教育动员，分别妥善安排：大部分乡干部可回到自己住家的社里去，担任农业社支部书记，改为半脱产，参加社内生产由社记工分；一部分乡干部仍然留在乡里工作；一部分在自愿的情况下转业回家生产，发给一定的退职金。　　　　　（刘天锡、陈耀先）
