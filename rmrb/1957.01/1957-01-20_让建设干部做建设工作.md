    Let Construction Cadres Do Construction Work
    What positions cadres trained in basic construction are assigned to after a project is completed has a significant impact on the growth of the nation's construction strength. The technical force of the construction unit (Party B) naturally follows the construction unit. What about the technical force of the construction unit (Party A), such as factories and mines? Currently, they are mostly transferred to production work. I believe this is not good. Cadres who have just become familiar with basic construction knowledge and gained some experience during several years of work are transferred to production work, which is detrimental to the growth of the cadres and to the nation's construction.
    Take the Shenyang Cable Factory as an example. It trained many cadres during the construction process. This was originally a valuable asset for national construction. When the construction work ended and the arrangement of cadres began, the basic construction department repeatedly requested that all or most of the basic construction cadres, especially the backbone and professional technical personnel of basic construction work, be assigned to other basic construction units. However, the Shenyang Cable Factory used the excuse that most of these cadres had been transferred from production three years ago, and kept a portion. The Shenyang Cable Factory's superior authority, the Electrical Industry Materials Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Electrical Materials Bureau), transferred most of the basic construction cadres to other production enterprises. Units urgently in need of basic construction cadres, such as the Xi'an New Factory Preparatory Office of the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry, did not get the personnel they needed. Even if some basic construction cadres could not be arranged within the scope of the Electrical Materials Bureau, the Electrical Materials Bureau was unwilling to let them go. For example, Comrade Fan Bingshan, who served as the installation section chief in the Shenyang Cable Factory for several years, should have been assigned to a unit with a larger installation workload and stronger installation expertise. However, the Electrical Materials Bureau assigned him to the Shanghai Wire Factory. Fan Bingshan brought his family to Shanghai to report, but the Shanghai Wire Factory politely declined because it had very little basic construction work and even less installation work. Fan Bingshan had to return to Beijing to find the Electrical Materials Bureau and heard that it had been decided to keep him working at the Electrical Materials Bureau. The Electrical Materials Bureau itself has no installation business, so why keep such an experienced installation section chief?
    National construction requires a large number of basic construction cadres. If each unit keeps the basic construction cadres after a project is completed, and new construction units have to train cadres all over again, how can our construction strength grow and how can construction experience be accumulated? Therefore, I hope that when a project is completed, the construction unit should let them go to new construction positions, except for retaining some basic construction cadres necessary for production.

    让建设干部做建设工作
    在基本建设中培养起来的干部，当工程结束后搁在什么岗位上，对国家建设力量的增长有很大的影响。施工单位（乙方）的技术力量，当然是跟着施工单位走的。工厂、矿山等建设单位（甲方）的技术力量怎么办呢？现在大都是调作生产工作了。我认为这样作是不好的。在几年的工作中刚刚熟悉了基本建设知识，并且有了一些经验的干部，又被调去做生产工作，对干部的成长，对国家的建设都是不利的。
    就拿沈阳电缆厂来说，在建厂过程中培养了不少干部。本来是国家建设中一笔宝贵的财产。当建厂工作结束，开始安排干部时，基本建设部门曾几次要求将全部或大部基本建设干部，特别是基本建设工作的骨干和专业技术人员，分配到其他基本建设单位去。但是，沈阳电缆厂借口这些干部大都是三年前由生产上抽调的，留了一部分；沈阳电缆厂的上级机关——电气工业材料管理局（以下简称电材局），又把大部分基本建设干部调到别的生产企业去，电机制造工业部西安新厂总筹备处等急需基本建设干部的单位，反而没有要到人。即使有些基本建设干部在电材局范围内没法安排，电材局也不肯放出去。如在沈阳电缆厂做了几年安装科长的范秉珊同志，理应分配到安装工程量较大、安装专业性较强的单位去。但是电材局把他分配到上海电线厂。范秉珊携家到上海报到，上海电线厂却因基本建设工作很少，安装工程更少，而婉言谢绝。范秉珊只得回北京找电材局，听说已决定留在电材局工作了。电材局本身没有安装业务，为什么要把这样一个有经验的安装科长留下来呢？
    国家的建设需要大量的基本建设干部，如果每个单位在工程结束后，都把基本建设干部留下来，让新的建设单位重新培养干部，我们 的建设力量怎么增长，建设经验怎么积累呢？因此，我希望当一个工程结束后，建设单位除了留一些生产上必需的基本建设干部以外，应该让他们到新的建设岗位去。
