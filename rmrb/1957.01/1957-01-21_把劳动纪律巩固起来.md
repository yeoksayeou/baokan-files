Consolidate Labor Discipline

    In recent years, China's working class, with selfless labor, has launched labor competitions and advanced producer movements, overcome various difficulties, and further developed production. This glorious achievement is undoubtedly inseparable from the conscious observance of labor discipline by the broad masses of workers. Many workers regard factories and mines as their own homes. Some are unwilling to retire when they are old, and some have persisted in full attendance for four or five consecutive years.
    However, recently, in some enterprises, due to the large increase in new workers and the weakening of political and ideological work, the phenomenon of relaxed labor discipline has occurred again. Some workers in the Liuzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory were absent from work without reason, not going to the factory for more than ten days or even one or two months. In the Shanghai Anjian Medical Machinery Factory, some young people would talk, laugh, comb their hair, dress up, and sing half an hour before the end of work, letting the gas lamps spew flames in vain and causing other workshops to stop work and wait for materials. In the Fushun Laohutai Coal Mine, 118 people were found sleeping underground in the three months from September to November. In the Datong Coal Mine, some workers beat doctors for other reasons because they could not get sick leave. More than a dozen such incidents occurred from January to October last year. Some doctors, fearing opposition from workers, adopted an irresponsible attitude of granting as many days of leave as requested. The health clinics of some large enterprises approved a maximum of one thousand working days of sick leave in a single day. In addition, some factories and mines have also seen phenomena such as not cherishing public property, gambling, stealing, or not returning to the dormitory late at night.
    Although this is the behavior of a few workers in individual factories and mines who are disrupting labor discipline, it has already brought adverse effects to many enterprises, causing labor productivity and product quality to decline and accidents to increase. This situation has also aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of conscious workers, because such behavior of disrupting labor discipline obviously tarnishes the glorious title of the working class.
    There are various reasons for the relaxation of labor discipline among workers. Chaotic production management, unreasonable wage and reward systems, and poor working conditions and welfare are all related. However, the failure of leaders in some enterprises to fully understand the relationship between promoting democracy, opposing bureaucracy, and consolidating labor discipline is also a very important reason.
    Some enterprise leaders set the promotion of democracy against the adherence to labor discipline. They said: "Don't insist on labor discipline, otherwise, people will criticize you for being bureaucratic again." These comrades adopted a compromising and indulgent attitude towards behaviors that violated discipline, and did not dare to fight at all. After the doctors of Datong Coal Mine were beaten by workers, the leaders of the coal mine did not rectify discipline and maintain the system. On the contrary, they only made passive concessions and handed over the power to approve sick leave to the production team leaders. Some coal mines even paid wages to workers who were absent from work without reason. What kind of discipline is this?
    It should be affirmed that cadres at all levels must humbly welcome criticisms and suggestions from the masses, strive to promote democracy, and improve leadership. However, the promotion of democracy cannot be separated from centralization, cannot abandon leadership, and cannot abolish labor discipline. The production of enterprises cannot proceed spontaneously. If one link fails to complete the plan, the entire plan will be affected. Therefore, if enterprise leaders fear that the masses will say "bureaucracy" and make unprincipled concessions, that is not promoting democracy, but a distortion of democracy and an abandonment of their responsibilities.
    Promoting democracy means promoting criticism and self-criticism from the masses. On the one hand, we must criticize bureaucracy in leadership, and on the other hand, we must also criticize the phenomena of freedom, looseness, indiscipline, and lack of a sense of responsibility as masters among some employees. We must educate those workers with poorer awareness through the majority of conscious workers. In this way, the result of promoting democracy will be to further consolidate labor discipline.
    Some enterprise leaders also set caring for the lives of workers against strengthening political education. They said: "The wind is not right now, talk less, do more, too much talk will lead to mistakes and cause trouble." They try to avoid meeting with the masses, and do not explain many things that cannot be done to the masses. As a result, not only does it cause dissatisfaction among some of the masses, but it also gives those who disrupt discipline an excuse. There is no doubt that we should actively solve the problems of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and so on raised by the masses. However, leaders should not only one-sidedly care about the economic lives of the masses, but not care about the political lives of the masses, and allow bad ideas to run rampant. While solving the problems of the masses' lives, we must carry out extensive political and ideological education, which includes discipline education.
    Many new workers now come from all walks of life. After arriving at the production post, living habits change greatly, and mood swings are inevitable. It is not surprising that a few individuals make mistakes. If we actively explain to this part of the new workers the relationship between observing discipline and building socialism, and the relationship between the individual and the collective, their emotions will quickly stabilize and production will return to normal. Some workers are emotional because they do not understand the overall situation. Therefore, while solving the problems of life, we must help the masses understand the overall situation, analyze clearly which difficulties are caused by bureaucracy and which difficulties are caused by objective reasons, and educate the broad masses to recognize right and wrong, support righteousness, and overwhelm evil.
    Some enterprise leaders also set opposing "punishmentism" against enforcing discipline. Some trade union staff often adopt an unprincipled attitude of protecting workers who have made mistakes. For example, some give sick leave slips to people who are absent from work without illness; and for those who repeatedly violate discipline and refuse to correct their mistakes, they do not give punishment but one-sidedly emphasize "persuasion and education." There is no doubt that we should educate a few workers with the enthusiasm of comrades, patiently help them get rid of bad habits, and educate employees who have made mistakes to recognize and correct their mistakes, and we should not adopt simple and rude attitudes. However, those who have degenerated into hooligans, thieves, or criminals, and who persist in their mistakes and refuse to be educated despite repeated attempts, must be given administrative sanctions or legal sanctions. Because they damage the honor of the working class and the public interest. The outline of labor rules within the enterprise stipulates that "if the enterprise administrative负责人 fails to deal with employees who have made mistakes as scheduled, they should be subject to certain punishments." This rule should also be strictly enforced.
    We believe that as long as enterprise leaders strengthen political and ideological education and rely on the efforts of the vast number of new and old workers, they will definitely be able to consolidate labor discipline.

### 把劳动纪律巩固起来

    把劳动纪律巩固起来
    我国工人阶级近几年来以忘我的劳动，开展了劳动竞赛和先进生产者运动，战胜了各种困难，进一步发展了生产。这种光荣的成绩无疑地是和广大工人群
  众自觉的遵守劳动纪律分不开的。许许多多工人把工厂和矿山当成自己
  的家。有的年老了不肯退休，有的连续四、五年坚持全勤。
    但是，近来在某些企业中由于新工人大量增加和政治思想工作减
  弱，又发生了劳动纪律松弛的现象。柳州市农业机械厂有的工人无故旷工，十几天以至一两个月不到厂上班。上海安建医疗机械厂有的青年离下班前半小时，便谈笑、梳头、整装、歌唱，让汽灯白白喷着火焰，让别的车间停工待料。抚顺老虎台煤矿从9月到11月三个月中发现在井下睡觉的有一百一十八人。大同煤矿有些工人因为请不准病假，便找其他借
  口殴打医生。这样的事从去年1月到10月发生了十几起，有的医生怕工人反对，便采取了要请假多少天便给假多少天的不负责任的态度。有的大企业的卫生所批准病假最多的一天达到一千个工作日。此外，有的厂矿还出现不爱护公物、赌博、偷盗或深夜不回宿舍的现象。
    这虽然是个别厂矿少数工人破坏劳动纪律的行为，但它已经给许多企业带来了不良的影响，使那些企业的劳动生产率和产品质量下降，事故增多，这种情况也引起广大有觉悟的工人的不满，因为这种破坏劳动纪律的行为，显然是玷污了工人阶级的光荣称号。
    工人劳动纪律松弛有多种原因。生产管理混乱、工资制度和奖惩制度不合理，劳动条件和生活福利不好，都有关系。但是，某些企业领导者对于发扬民主、反对官僚主义和巩固劳动纪律的关系认识不全面，也是很重要的原因。
    有的企业领导干部把发扬民主和坚持劳动纪律对立起来。他们说：“不要坚持劳动纪律，不然，人们又要批评你官僚主义了。”这些同志对于破坏纪律的行为，采取了迁就放纵的态度，根本不敢进行斗争。大同煤矿的医生被工人殴打以后，煤矿的领导人员不去整顿纪律，维护制度，相反，只消极让步，把批准病假的权力交给了生产班长。还有的煤矿给无故不上班的工人照发工资。这样还有什么纪律呢？
    应该肯定：各级干部必须虚心欢迎来自群众的批评和建议，努力发扬民主，改进领导。可是，发扬民主不能离开集中，不能放弃领导，取消劳动纪律。企业的生产不能自流地进行，有一个环节完不成计划，整个计划就会受到影响。因此企业领导人员如果怕群众说“官僚主义”而无原则地退让，那不是什么发扬民主，而是对民主的曲解，放弃了自己应负的责任。
    发扬民主，就是要发扬群众的批评和自我批评。一方面要批判领导上的官僚主义，另一方面也要批判某些职工的自由散漫、不守纪律、缺乏主人翁责任感的现象。要通过大多数有觉悟的职工，去教育那些觉悟较差的职工。这样，发扬民主的结果，就会使劳动纪律更加巩固起来。
    还有的企业领导人员把关心职工生活和加强政治教育对立起来。他们说：“现在风头不对，少说话，多办事，言多必失，会惹火烧身”。他们尽量避免和群众见面，许多不能办到的事情也不去向群众解释。结果不仅引起一部分群众不满，也给了破坏纪律的分子以借口。毫无疑问，我们应该积极去解决群众提出来的衣、食、住、行等等问题。但是，领导人员不应该只是片面地关心群众的经济生活，而不关心群众的政治生活，任凭坏思想自由泛滥。在解决群众生活问题的同时，必须进行广泛的政治思想教育工作，其中就包括纪律教育。
    现在有许多新工人是来自社会各阶层的。到了生产岗位以后，生活习惯变化很大，情绪波动是难免的。个别人犯错误也是不足为奇的。如果我们主动地对这一部分新工人讲清遵守纪律和建设社会主义的关系，个人和集体的关系，他们的情绪会很快稳定下来，使生产走上正常轨道。还有一些工人闹情绪是因为他们对全面情况不了解。因此，在解决生活问题的同时，必须帮助群众了解全面情况，分析清楚哪些是官僚主义造成的困难，哪些是客观原因造成的困难，教育广大群众认清是非，扶持正气，压倒邪气。
    某些企业领导人员还把反对“惩办主义”和执行纪律对立起来。有些工会工作人员对待犯了错误的工人，往往采取无原则的袒护态度。比如，有的给无病而旷工的人补开病假条子；对屡犯不改的严重违反纪律的分子，不给予处分而片面强调“说服教育”。毫无疑问，我们应该以同志的热情，耐心教育少数工人摆脱坏的作风，教育犯错误的职工认识和改正自己的错误，不应该采取简单粗暴的态度。但是，对于已经堕落为流氓、小偷或罪犯，并且坚持错误，屡教不改的分子，必须给予行政处分或法律的制裁。因为他们损害了工人阶级的荣誉和公共利益。在企业内部劳动规则纲要中规定，对于犯错误的职工，“企业行政负责人不如期处理时，应受一定的处分”，这一条规则同样应该严格执行。
    我们相信，只要企业领导者加强政治思想教育，依靠广大新老工人的努力，就一定能够把劳动纪律巩固起来。
