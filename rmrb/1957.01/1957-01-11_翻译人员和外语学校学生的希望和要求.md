    Hopes and Demands of Translators and Foreign Language School Students	Importance of Translation Work
    We are translators from the Second Ministry of Machine Building Design Institute. We are writing to you about some unpleasant problems we encounter in our work.
      (1) We feel that some of the responsible comrades leading our work do not understand the complexity of translation as labor, and therefore are indifferent to the hardships of translators and the problems in their work. When translations are needed, the leadership knows that there are translation cadres in the institute; when translations are not needed, the translators are like vagrants, with no one caring about their political studies or other matters. The issue of translation work has never been discussed in the institute's meetings. The production departments send materials for translation, mostly "urgent materials that experts are waiting to see," some sent in the morning and needed by the afternoon, leaving no time even to copy them by hand. The planning department never arranges translation plans. It's as if translators are talking machines. Sometimes when translators offer suggestions, the former director of our institute would sternly rebuke: "Translators are like bottles, not full of vinegar but making a lot of noise, always having opinions, engaging in individualism." Therefore, translators can only "swallow the bitter lotus root, unable to express their suffering."
    We believe that translation is arduous labor, and neither translation work nor translators should be subject to any kind of contempt.
    (2) The utilization of translation cadres. Our work is characterized by: a few months of intensive work each year, working overtime to meet deadlines. After the rush, everyone is idle. For example, in 1955, there were only four months of work, and the rest of the eight months were mostly idle. The entire year's workload could be completed by fifty-five people, but in reality, our institute hoarded one hundred and nine translators (referring to 1955). After recognizing these work characteristics, our leadership did not conduct good research or make appropriate adjustments or arrangements, such as organizing everyone to study during idle periods. They believe: wasting translator labor is better than not, wasting a little doesn't matter. One bureau director said, "Training soldiers for a thousand days to use them for one." In fact, the leadership did not systematically cultivate us. Zhang San can randomly pull you to translate a few sentences, and Li Si can inexplicably ask you to translate a few words. If the translation is not good, without clarifying the situation, they always criticize. They say, "To be a translator, you must be able to translate everything, and everything should be translated well." In this situation, it's impossible for translators to have any specialization. Of course, the translation department is also divided into various professional groups, but this is only the case when there is no work. When foreign materials arrive, everything is mixed up. Some people are in this group today and another group tomorrow. One comrade changed seven specialties in three years. The constant shuffling, coupled with the numerous professional projects, such as the process group including mechanical processing, machine repair, electrical welding, electrical repair, carpentry, warehouse, casting, forging, heat treatment, chemical engineering, and many other categories, makes it difficult for translators to master and improve their skills, even with three heads and six arms. In addition, some translators are scattered in twos and threes in various production departments. Because there is no work, some section chiefs let them do miscellaneous tasks, acting as mail clerks and copyists, which makes it even more impossible to have any specialization.
      (3) The cultivation of translators. Our institute has cultivation plans for engineering and technical personnel and administrative management personnel, but not for translators. Faced with dozens of specialties in our institute, translators don't know what to learn or how to learn. Of course, translators are not just waiting for the leadership to make arrangements. They have made some efforts themselves, but the leadership not only does not support and help but sometimes imposes various restrictions. For example, translators want to read novels by Gorky and Chekhov during idle periods to improve their Russian foundation, but our institute stipulates that literary works cannot be read during production time. Translators want to take night university courses and organize themselves to review high school courses, but the former Party Committee Secretary called the section chief and instructed them not to organize cultural studies. Translators want to invite a Soviet expert's family member to teach us Russian, but it has not been resolved after two or three years. Translators want to invite technical personnel to teach them technical courses, but the institute leadership and section leadership disagree. Translators want to organize some amateur translations, but the leadership says it's not encouraged and that all royalties will be turned over to the public, which is actually not allowed. In this situation, how can we improve our skills? At a time when science and technology are developing rapidly, how can we not worry about our future as translators with low levels of expertise?
    In short, due to various forms of contempt for translators, as well as improper use and lack of cultivation plans, we have shaken our commitment to our work and fallen into distress. These situations are by no means unique to our institute. Many other units also have these problems. Therefore, we hope that relevant leading departments can carefully study the existing problems of translators and solve them thoroughly. In particular, we hope that the leaders of our ministry can attach importance to solving the problems in our work. We also hope that comrades in the translation field will work together to solve the problems in their work with the leadership and assistance of relevant departments.

      The Shenyang Third Design Branch of the First Ministry of Machine Building Design General Bureau has nearly forty translators. In 1955 and 1956, there were only two batches of translation tasks. In terms of workload, forty people could complete it in four months. The remaining twenty months were spent doing proofreading, traveling, and other "scattered tasks." I personally ran around in 1956 because the bureau had no work to do. I worked at the Beijing Machine Tool Factory for more than a month, at the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory for nearly two months, and at the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory for nearly half a year.
    As far as I know, not only our bureau is like this. The Beijing First Design Branch and the Shenyang Fourth Design Branch also have a large number of translators who have nothing to do for a long time. The expert studio of Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory has interpreters and two translation teams: civil engineering team and mechanical engineering team. It is said that because there was nothing to translate, the civil engineering translation team was disbanded last September. Some members of this team were transferred to the design section, some to the cadre section, security section, and Communist Youth League Committee. After all these transfers, eight people still could not be transferred. What to do? A short-term training class was set up to teach them planning and statistics. Four of these translators graduated from Dalian Russian College last September and were transferred to this factory. They changed their profession without doing any translation work. In addition, the translators of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory were doing typing, printing, and binding work last June after translating the advanced manuals presented by the Soviet advanced producers' delegation. The forging and pressing plant under construction in Wuhan has thirteen translators who have nothing to do and wandered around the streets for more than two months; they were recently sent to Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory for "internship." Twenty or thirty translators from a factory in Wuhan changed their professions without doing a day of work after arriving at the factory.
    Editor, as a translator, I feel it is my responsibility to reflect these unreasonable phenomena of hoarding translation power and request the relevant departments to attach importance to translation work, rationally use translation power, so that every translator can have something to do and contribute to the construction of the motherland.　Tan Changfu	    Translation "Cold Storage"
    The China International Travel Service has dozens of translators, including Russian, English, and French translators, as well as translators of Korean, Burmese, and Vietnamese. But except for the Russian translators who have a certain amount of work, most of the other translators only have a few days of work a month, and some have not had anything to do for one or two years. Everyone is eager to work and eager to gain some practical knowledge. But they have to sit helplessly for eight hours every day. They feel that this is a loss to the country, so some people ask the leadership to let them go to places where there is work to do. An English translator, an excellent student who graduated from Peking University in 1955, asked to be allowed to go to Peking University to be a graduate student; a Korean translator did not want to be asked to carry luggage without doing translation work, so he asked to be transferred to a publishing house... However, the leadership believes that these people are "not at ease in their work" and "have ideological problems," saying that they "only consider personal gains and losses," and "there is no work now, but there will be in the future, wait patiently!" This is clearly a problem of not having work to do, how can it be said that they are not at ease in their work? Moreover, if it is said that there will be work in a few years, then why keep them now? In a few years, they will probably forget their foreign languages.
    As far as I know, in the branches of other major cities, some translators often have no work to do. For example, some branches only need one Russian translator, but they use three. Some translators have not done any translation work for several years, only carrying luggage and buying train tickets. This can't help but make people ask: In the high tide of our country's construction, why should a large group of translators be put into cold storage? I hope that the leaders of the company can answer and solve this problem.　Bai Duyin	  Hope for Good Learning Conditions
    We are third-year students majoring in Arabic at the Department of Eastern Languages ​​at Peking University. Now we will talk about some problems we encounter in our studies and our demands.
    We feel that the school's goal of cultivating us is unclear. Since entering school in 1954, our Arabic major has had no teaching syllabus. Even at the end of a semester, the teachers do not know what the requirements for this class are for this semester, let alone a complete teaching syllabus. More seriously, sometimes classes have already started, but the lecture notes for this class have not been printed yet. The teaching syllabus cannot be formulated, partly because there are not enough teachers to formulate it systematically, and partly because it has not been given enough attention in the past. We hope that this situation can be changed in the future, and that students will no longer be cultivated aimlessly.
    In our country, only the Department of Eastern Languages ​​at Peking University cultivates Arabic cadres. In recent years, due to the urgent need for Arabic translation cadres, the number of students in our major has increased nearly five times from 1953 to 1956. And the teachers? Only three have been added: two teaching assistants and one Egyptian expert. One of our associate professors is constantly being transferred out to work. This has to reduce the students' courses. This semester, the third grade should have fourteen to sixteen professional courses per week, but due to the lack of teachers, it has to be reduced to twelve. This relatively affects the students' studies. Therefore, we hope that the school can appropriately strengthen the teaching force and improve the quality of teaching.
    As everyone knows, how important dictionaries and related reference books are to people who study foreign languages. However, the only Chinese-Arabic dictionary currently available in our country is older than us (published in July 1934). And even such a dictionary is rarely seen in our library, with only one copy in a total of four reading rooms. As for the original Arabic dictionaries, there is not even a shadow in the library. But as far as we know, there are reprints of this Arabic dictionary in Shanghai. At the same time, the learning reference books we need are often not available in the International Bookstore. Arabic, Burmese, and Urdu books and newspapers and magazines rarely appear in the International Bookstore, and when they do, the prices are terribly expensive. Therefore, we hope that the school authorities and relevant parties can create better learning conditions for us.

### 翻译人员和外语学校学生的希望和要求

专栏：读者来信

    翻译人员和外语学校学生的希望和要求	重视翻译工作
    我们是第二机械工业部设计院的翻译人员，现将我们在工作中碰到的一些不愉快的问题告诉你们。
      （一）我们感到某些领导我们工作的负责同志，不了解翻译这种劳动的复杂性，因而对翻译人员的甘苦与工作上的问题漠不关心。在使用着翻译的时候，领导上还知道院内有翻译干部；而不需要翻译的时候，翻译就好比流浪汉一样，无人过问他们的政治学习以及其它方面的问题。在院务会议的议程上，从来没有讨论过翻译工作问题。各生产科送来要翻译的资料，多是“专家急等着看”的火急资料，有的上午送来，下午就要，连手抄一遍也来不及。而计划处从来也不安排翻译计划。好像翻译是一些能说话的机器。有时翻译同志提一点意见，我院前任院长还厉声责斥：“翻译是一瓶醋不满，半瓶醋晃荡，整天有意见，闹个人主义。”因此翻译只好“哑吧吃黄连，有苦说不出”。
    我们认为：翻译是一种艰苦的劳动，翻译工作和翻译人员都不应该受到任何轻视。
    （二）翻译干部的使用问题。我们的工作特点是：一年只有几个月的突击工作，加班加点赶任务。突击完了，大家都窝工。例如1955年全年只有四个月有工作，其余八个月的时间大部分都闲着。全年工作量只需五十五人就能完成，而实际上我院囤积了一百零九名翻译（指1955年）。我们领导上在认识了这些工作特点以后，并没有很好研究，加以适当调整或安排，如在窝工期间组织大家学习等。他们认为：翻译的劳动?，不浪费更好，浪费点也不要紧。有一位局长说：“养兵千日，用在一朝。”事实上领导上对我们并没有有计划的培养。张三可以随便拉你去翻几个句子，李四又可以没头没脑的要你翻几个字。翻得不好的话，不分清红皂白，总是批评一通。说什么“做翻译，什么都要能翻，什么都应该翻得好。”在这种情况下，翻译也就根本谈不上有什么专业。当然翻译科也分为各种专业组，但这只在没有工作的情况下才这样分，国外资料一来就全要打乱使用。有的人今天在这一组，明天又到那一组。有一个同志三年内换了七种专业。来回乱调，再加上专业项目繁多，如工艺组就包括有机械加工、机修、电焊、电修、木工、仓库、铸造、锻压、热处理、化工等许多名堂，翻译即使三头六臂，也很难掌握并提高业务。此外，还有一部分翻译被三三两两的分散在各生产科，由于没有工作，某些科长就让他们零星打杂，当收发和抄写员，这就更说不上有什么专业了。
      （三）对翻译人员的培养问题。我院对于工程技术人员和行政管理人员都有培养规划，而独没有培养翻译人员的规划。翻译人员面对着我院几十种专业，不知道学什么、怎么学。当然翻译人员也并不是坐待领导上的安排的，他们自己也作过一些努力，但领导上不仅不予支持和帮助，有时反而给以种种限制。例如，翻译人员为了提高俄语基础，想在窝工期间读一些高尔基和契呵夫的小说，但我院规定生产时间不得阅读文学作品。翻译人员想考夜大学，自己组织起来复习高中的课程，但前党委书记把科长找去，指示不要组织文化学习。翻译人员想请一个苏联专家的家属来替我们上俄文课，但闹了两三年，也没有解决。翻译人员想请技术人员替他们上技术课，但院领导和科领导不同意。翻译同志想组织一些业余翻译，但领导上说不提倡，又说稿酬全部归公，实际上就是不准翻译。在这种情况下，我们又怎么能提高业务呢？当此科学技术日益迅速向前发展的时候，又怎么能叫我们这些水平不高的翻译人员不耽心自己的前途呢？
    总之，由于对翻译人员的种种轻视，以及使用不当、缺乏培养规划，使我们对本身工作发生了动摇，陷入苦闷。这些情况决不是我院仅有的现象。其他许多单位也普遍存在着这样的情况。因此，我们希望有关领导部门能很好研究一下翻译工作者现存的问题，加以彻底解决。特别是希望我部领导上，能重视解决我们工作中存在的问题。我们也希望翻译界的同志们共同努力，在有关部门的领导和帮助下，自己动手来解决自己工作中的问题。
  丁远、文刀、吴明、辽夫、长庚	    我们要求有工作
      第一机械工业部设计总局沈阳第三设计分局拥有近四十名翻译，在1955和1956两年中，只有两批翻译任务，按工作量来说，只要四十个人干四个月，其余二十个月的时间，就只是做一些校对、出差等“零星任务”。我个人在1956年度就因为局里没有工作可干而到处跑，在北京机床厂干了一个多月，在沈阳机床二厂干了近两个月，在武汉重型机床厂干了近半年。
    据我了解，不只我们这个局如此，北京第一设计分局、沈阳第四设计分局，都有大量翻译人员较长时间没事可做。武汉重型机床厂专家工作室除有口译人员外，还有两个笔译组：土建组和机械组。据说因为没有东西可翻，去年九月份把土建翻译组解散了。这个组的人员，有的转到了设计科，有的转到干部科、保卫科和团委会。就这样转来转去，最后还是有八名没转出去。怎么处理呢？来个短期训练班，叫他们学计划和统计。其中有四名翻译同志，是去年九月份才从大连俄专毕业调到这个厂的，一天翻译工作都没作就转了业。此外，沈阳第二机床厂的翻译人员，去年六月份在译好苏联先进生产者代表团赠送的先进手册之后，在干打字、印刷和装订工作。武汉筹建的锻压厂有十三名翻译人员，没工作可干，逛了两个多月的马路；前些时才被派到武汉重型机床厂来“实习”。武汉某厂的二、三十名翻译同志，到厂后，一天工作没干就转业了。
    编辑同志，作为一个翻译工作者，我觉得自己有责任把这些窝藏翻译力量的不合理现象反映出来，并请求各有关部门重视翻译工作，合理地使用翻译力量，使每个翻译工作者都能有事可做，为祖国建设贡献出自己的一点力量。　谭常孚	    翻译“冷藏库”
    国际旅行社有几十名翻译人员，其中有俄文、英文、法文翻译，也有朝鲜、缅甸、越南等国文字的翻译。但除了俄文翻译有一定的工作外，其他大部分翻译一个月只能有几天的工作，甚至还有一、二年来没有一点事情可做的。大家都渴望工作，渴望得到一些实际知识。但他们每天要无可奈何地清坐八小时。他们感到这对国家是一个损失，于是有人就请求领导上放他们到有工作可做的地方去。某英文翻译是1955年北京大学毕业的优秀学生，要求能让他到北京大学去当研究生；某朝鲜文翻译不愿意光叫他搬行李而不做翻译工作，就要求把自己调到某出版社去……。可是领导上认为这些人是“不安心工作”“闹思想问题”，说他们“光考虑个人得失”，“现在没有工作，将来会有的，耐心地等待吧！”这明明是没有工作可做的问题，怎能说是他们不安心工作呢？况且，如果说几年后会有工作，那何苦现在要留着他们呢？几年之后恐怕他们连外文也忘光了。
    据我所知，在其他大城市的分社中，有些翻译也常常是没有工作可做的。如有的分社只要一个俄文翻译就够了，却用了三个，有的翻译几年来没有做过一次翻译工作，光是搬搬行李，买买火车票。这不禁使人要问：在我国的建设高潮中，为什么要把一大群翻译人员冷藏起来呢？希望该社领导上能答复并解决这个问题。　白度阴	  希望有好的学习条件
    我们是北京大学东语系阿拉伯专业三年级的学生，现在谈谈我们在学习当中遇到的一些问题和我们的要求。
    我们感到学校培养我们的目标是不明确的。自从1954年入学以来，我们阿拉伯语专业就没有教学大纲，甚至到一学期完了，老师们还不知道这学期对这班同学的要求是什么，当然更不必说有整套的教学大纲了。更严重的是，有时候已经上课了，可是这一节课的讲义还没有印出来。教学大纲不能订出来，一方面是因为师资不够，无法系统拟订，另一方面也是由于过去对此重视不够。我们希望今后能改变这种情况，不要再漫无目标的培养学生了。
    在我国仅仅只有北京大学东语系培养阿拉伯文干部。近年来由于对阿拉伯语翻译干部的迫切需要，我们专业的学生从1953年到1956年增加了将近五倍。而教师呢？仅只增加了三位：两个助教，一个埃及专家。我们的一个副教授还要不断的被调出去工作。这就不得不减少同学们的课程，这学期三年级按说应该每周上专业课十四节至十六节，但由于师资缺少，不得不减至十二节。这就相对的影响了同学的学习。因此，我们希望学校能适当加强教学力量，提高教学质量。
    大家知道，对学外文的人来说，字典和有关的参考书该是多么重要，可是现在我国唯一有的一本中阿字典，年纪比我们还大（1934年7月出版）。而就是这样一本字典，在我们图书馆里还很少见，四个阅览室一共只有一本。至于阿文原版的字典，图书馆中连个影子也找不到。但据我们所知，在上海就有这种阿文字典的翻印本。同时，我们所需要的学习参考书，在国际书店中常常买不到。国际书店中很少出现阿拉伯文、缅甸文和乌尔都文的书籍和报章杂志，偶而来一批，价钱也贵得可怕。因此，我们希望学校当局以及有关方面能为我们创造一些较好的学习条件。
