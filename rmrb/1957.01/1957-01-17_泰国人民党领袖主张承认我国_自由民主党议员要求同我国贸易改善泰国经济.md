Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, January 15th: Nai Sobhon Ottakorn, leader of the newly formed Thai People's Party, told the press on the 9th that the People's Party's foreign policy is based on the United Nations Charter, and insists that Thailand should be friends with all countries. He said that Thailand should recognize the People's Republic of China.

The People's Party leader also said that the People's Party believes that Thailand should withdraw from the Manila Treaty Organization; Thailand does not need American military assistance, only American economic assistance.

Nai Sobhon said that his party believes that Thailand should conduct free trade with all countries in the world, including its neighbor China.

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, January 15th: Nai Amphorn Suwannabhongse, a member of the Free Democratic Party of Thailand, told the press on the 9th that trade with China is the best way out for the Thai economy.

The legislator said that the Thai people urgently demand the improvement of Thailand's economic situation. At present, Thailand's foreign markets are shrinking day by day, and Thailand's trade with European and American countries has always been in a disadvantageous position of huge import surplus for many years. He pointed out that it is precisely for these reasons that he and other Thai businessmen initiated the organization of the "Thai Import and Export Trade Association" in order to quickly open up Thailand's foreign markets.

    泰国人民党领袖主张承认我国
    自由民主党议员要求同我国贸易改善泰国经济
    据新华社15日讯　曼谷消息：泰国新近成立的人民党领袖乃颂博·渥塔夫军9日向报界发表谈话说，人民党的对外政策是根据联合国宪章，坚持泰国应当和一切国家做朋友。他说，泰国应该承认中华人民共和国。
    这位人民党领袖还说，人民党认为，泰国应当退出马尼拉条约组织；泰国不需要美国的军事援助，只需要美国的经济援助。
    乃颂博说，他的党认为泰国应当同世界上一切国家，包括同泰国的邻邦中国进行自由贸易。
    据新华社15日讯　曼谷消息：泰国自由民主党议员乃安蓬·素旺那汶9日向报界发表谈话说，和中国进行贸易是泰国经济最好的一条出路。
    这位议员说，泰国人民迫切要求改善泰国的经济情况。目前，泰国的国外市场正一天比一天缩小，泰国对欧美国家的贸易连年来始终是处于不利的巨额入超的地位。他指出，正是由于这些原因，他才和另外一些泰国商人发起组织“泰国出入口贸易协会”，以便迅速地开辟泰国的国外市场。
