At the Home of Veteran Party Member Szabó Győző
——A Sequel to “Sleeping Overnight in an Immigrant Village”
By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang

Old Communist Party member Szabó Győző is a sixty-seven-year-old stockman. His small, wrinkled face often carries a humorous expression. He is never without his pipe, and he holds his chest high, filled with confidence in the path he has traveled in his life. Dressed in an old blue cloth shirt, covered by a worn-out wool vest, and wearing high-top boots, his legs always stand firmly. This dim and old-fashioned outfit seems to emanate a life force through his breathing.

As soon as he saw us returning from visiting neighbors, he said with great enthusiasm: "You are lucky you didn't run into the devil! Sit down and have dinner." He suggested we drink a glass of white wine to increase our warmth. Szabó’s wife brought out a box of freshly fried pig intestines and frozen meat, and we ate in the kitchen. The wine was homemade; their cooperative members each have eight or nine mu of private land and their own vineyards. Wine has become a very common drink for Hungarians, and even the tea after dinner is mixed with a spoonful or half a cup of wine. Finally, the hostess brought out two boxes of sweet pastries, and the simple dinner came to an end.

We went into the bedroom of his eldest daughter, Irén, on the left, where a decorated fir tree stood in the corner. His younger son, János, who is a sixth-grade student this year, also returned from outside at this time. He told his mother that tonight he dressed up as Santa Claus and toured twenty-one homes to offer congratulations, receiving forty forints and many candies. He ate all the candies himself and gave the forty forints to his mother. His mother said, "Then take a few candies from the Christmas tree and offer them to the Chinese guests!" Szabó's family was only missing their eldest son and daughter-in-law. They work in a factory in the outer city and probably didn't come back because of the inconvenient transportation. János’s mother said to us: "Tonight, you are also members of our family, gathering with us." I gave them a box of Chinese tea, and everyone gathered around to admire the beautiful patterns on the green tea box. Szabó tilted his head, squinted, and pointed to the Chinese characters on it with his pipe, asking what they meant. At this time, János took the box from his mother's hand and asked how Chinese children could recite so many strokes of characters by heart.

Our conversation turned to the old man. Szabó recounted how he was sent to the Russian front during the First World War and became a prisoner of war, and how he later joined the Soviet Red Army. Later, he returned to the Nitra region of Slovakia and settled down in the town of Semp, where many Hungarians lived. He joined the underground Communist Party in 1927, when he was a water mill worker. Life was very difficult for his family of seven. In 1947, they moved back to Hungary, and the government gave them land and houses. The children all received secondary education, and now, except for the youngest son, the whole family are Communist Party members and have their own occupations. Szabó was very pleased that his children did not go astray during this incident. He is also optimistic about the development of cooperative business. This year, the cooperative bought a small tractor itself and plans to sell four oxen soon. The living standards of the members have improved; this year, each labor day can be divided into forty forints (six forints equals one yuan RMB) in cash and in kind.

Irén works in the state assembly, so she has some understanding of the cooperative situation in the state. She said that because this state is on the transportation line to the West, it has suffered more from counter-revolutionary sabotage, and many good cooperatives have been forcibly dissolved. Therefore, 50% of the cooperatives were dissolved during the counter-revolutionary riots, and in the last two weeks, 20% of the cooperatives have been reorganized.

After the incident, Szabó was an active member of the village Communist Party organization to defend the achievements of socialism. He guarded the township government and the cooperative's cattle sheds day and night in shifts. On December 7, when the Tata coal city party committee was surrounded by thugs, the city party committee appealed to the farmers of the village. At that time, Szabó led a group of armed Communist Party members to rush to help the city party committee out of the siege.

Szabó strongly supports the current government. He believes that Nagy's betrayal of socialism had already begun before the October incident. The agricultural policy vigorously promoted by Nagy in 1953 was a policy that violated the interests of the real farmers. He encouraged all cooperatives to dissolve and develop a small-scale peasant economy, which many farmers could not understand at that time.

Everyone was a little tired. I was worried whether I, this "uninvited guest," would disturb the host's sleep. After taking a look at the opposite room and seeing four beds inside, I felt relieved. There were also three wardrobes against the wall, and several paintings hung on the wall next to the host's bed. Horó, Szabó's second daughter, is a ticket seller at a car company and is now recuperating at home due to a car accident injury. The old father turned on the small radio, broadcasting Christmas music. Szabó's wife pulled out a large wooden basin shaped like a manger from under a single bed, showing us the 150 kilograms of pork pickled inside, which was from a pig she raised herself and slaughtered the day before the holiday. I said that Chinese rural areas also like to slaughter pigs during the New Year, and like Hungarians, they regard pork as the main meat. They found these similar habits of the two peoples to be kind and interesting.

We said good night to each other and prepared to go to sleep. Szabó's wife was not interested in the midnight Mass and was also preparing to go to bed. Horó told me that in the past in Hungary, some party members still couldn't leave God and often went to church. She said, "We cannot call these people Communist Party members."

Irén and I slept in the same room. This spring, she used her savings from fifteen years of work to customize a set of exquisite dowry. According to Hungarian rural customs, girls must bring a dowry when they get married, at least two goose down quilts.

The stove in the room was not lit. Although it is close to the coal area, it is difficult to get coal this winter. The warm goose down quilt we were covering was accumulated by Irén since she was a little girl. Rural girls have to help their families raise geese every year. When the geese grow up, the whole family eats the goose meat, and the goose down is left for the girls to use. Therefore, almost every household in the countryside has goose down quilts, and in this winter of coal shortage, they especially feel the significance of the girls' labor.

The morning snow light shone through the gauze curtains, making the patterns on the window curtains particularly bright and beautiful. Irén took out her favorite clothes from the closet, planning to go to the factory in Komárom City this morning to meet her friends. While we were having breakfast, the state party secretary had sent a car to pick me up. Although I only had one night together with Szabó's family, a deep feeling had developed. Szabó's family all said that they have a beautiful lake, mountains, sanatoriums, and many cherry orchards, and they hope I will come again. I said that I will come to see your spring sowing when the cherry blossoms bloom this year.

    在老党员沙布·吉绍的家里
    ——“夜宿移民村”续篇
    本报记者　胡济邦
    老共产党员沙布·吉绍是一位六十七岁的饲养员。瘦小而多皱纹的脸经常带着幽默的表情。手不离烟斗，胸膛挺得高高的，对自己一生走过的道路充满着信心。上身穿着一件旧蓝布衬衫，外面罩着已经磨光了的毛坎肩，脚上穿着高统靴子，他的两条腿总是站得稳稳地。这一身灰暗的陈旧服装通过他的呼吸好像透出一种生命的力量。
    他一看见我们串门回来，就兴致勃勃地说：“你们幸运没有碰上魔鬼！快坐下吃晚饭吧。”他建议我们喝一杯白酒，增加一些热量。沙布的妻子拿出一盒刚炸好的猪肠和冻肉，我们就在厨房里用饭了。酒是自己做的，他们的社员每家都有八、九亩私用土地，都有自己的葡萄园。酒对于匈牙利人来说已经是一种极普通的饮料，饭后喝的茶也要冲进一匙或半杯葡萄酒。最后主妇拿出两盒甜点心，简单的晚饭就这样结束了。
    我们走进左边的一间大女儿依玲的卧房，墙角放着一棵已经装饰好的枞树。小儿子亚诺什今年是六年级的小学生，这时也从外面回来了。他告诉母亲说，今晚他装了圣诞老人到二十一家巡回祝贺，得到四十个福林和许多糖果。糖果自己都吃了，四十个福林交给了母亲。妈妈说，“那么到圣诞树上摘下几块糖来请中国客人吃吧！”沙布全家只缺少大儿子和媳妇了。他们在外城工厂里做工，可能是因为交通不便没有回来。亚诺什的母亲对我们说：“你们今晚也是我家的成员，和我们一起团聚。”我赠送他们一盒中国茶叶，大家都凑过来欣赏这个绿色茶盒子的美丽图案。沙布把脸一歪，眯着细眼用烟斗嘴子指着那上面的中国字问是什么意思。这时亚诺什从母亲手上拿去这个盒子，并问中国儿童怎么能默写出这样多笔划的字。
    我们的谈话转到老头身上了。沙布叙述他在第一次世界大战时怎样被送到俄国前线而当了俘虏，又怎样参加了苏联红军。后来他回到斯洛伐克的尼特拉州，在塞姆镇成了家。那边住着许多匈牙利人。1927年加入了地下共产党，那时他是一个水磨工人。一家七口生活非常困难。1947年迁回匈牙利，政府给他们土地和房子，孩子们都受到中等教育，现在除小儿子外，全家都是共产党员，都有自己的职业。沙布对自己的儿女们在此次事件中没有随波逐流走错道路非常满意。他对于合作社业务的发展也很乐观。今年社里自己置办了一架小型拖拉机，准备不久卖出四头耕牛。社员生活水平都有提高，今年每个劳动日可以分到四十福林（六福林合一元人民币）的现金和实物。
    依玲在州议会工作，因此她对本州合作社情况有些了解。她说这一州因为处在通往西方的交通线上，受反革命的摧残比较大，有许多好的社都被强制解散了。因此在反革命暴乱的时期有50％的社解散了，最近两周已有20％的社又重新组织起来。
    沙布在事件发生后是积极组织本村共产党员保卫社会主义成果的一员，他在乡政府和社的牛舍周围日夜轮流守卫。12月7日塔塔煤城市党委被暴徒包围时，市党委曾向该村农民呼吁，当时沙布带领着一部分武装起来的共产党员不顾一切地赶去，帮助市委解了围。
    沙布对现在的政府是极力支持的。他认为纳吉的背叛社会主义早在十月事件以前就已开始，1953年纳吉极力推行的农业政策就是违背真正农民利益的政策，他鼓励所有合作社都解散，发展小农经济，当时就有许多农民想不通。
    大家都有些疲乏了。我耽心我这个“不速之客”是否会妨碍主人的睡眠。当参观了一下对面的房间，看到里边放着四张床后，我才安心了。靠墙还有三个衣橱，在主人床头的那边墙上挂着几张画。霍娄是沙布的第二个女儿，她在汽车公司当售票员，因为撞车受伤现在家里休养。老爸爸扭开小收音机，播送着圣诞节的音乐。沙布的妻子从一张单人床的下面拉出一个像马槽形状的大木盆，给我们看里面腌着一百五十公斤猪肉，是她自己喂大的一口猪，在节日前一天才宰的。我说中国农村过年也欢喜宰猪，和匈牙利人一样也是把猪肉当着主要的肉食。他们对两国人民这些相似的习惯感到亲切有趣。
    我们互道了晚安，都准备睡觉了。沙布的妻子对午夜的弥撒并不感兴趣，也准备上床了。霍娄告诉我，过去在匈牙利有些党员还是离不开上帝，经常进教堂。她说：“我们不能把这些人称为共产党员。”
    我和依玲睡在一个房间，她在今年春天用了自己十五年劳动得来的积蓄定制了一套精致的嫁妆。按照匈牙利农村的风习，姑娘们出嫁时都要带一套嫁妆，至少也要带去两条鹅绒被。
    房间的火炉没有生火，这里虽近靠煤区，但今年冬天很难得到煤。我们盖着的温暖的鹅绒被，是依玲从小姑娘的时候就开始积累起来的。农村的姑娘们每年要帮助家里养鹅，鹅长大了，鹅肉全家吃了，鹅绒就留给姑娘们用。因此农村里几乎家家都有鹅绒被，在今年煤荒的冬季，特别感到姑娘们这项劳动的意义。
    早晨的雪光透过挑纱的窗帘，显出窗帏的花纹特别鲜明美丽。依玲从衣橱里取出自己最喜爱的服装，打算今早到科马洛姆城的工厂去会见她的朋友。我们正在早餐的时候，州委书记已派了汽车来接我，我虽然和沙布一家只有一夜的相聚，但已发生了深厚的感情。沙布一家都说他们这里有一个美丽的湖，有山林，有休养所，还有很多樱桃园，希望我再来。我说，在今年樱桃花开的时候，再来看你们的春播。
