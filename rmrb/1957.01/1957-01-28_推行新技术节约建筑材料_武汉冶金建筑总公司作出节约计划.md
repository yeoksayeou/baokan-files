Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th. The Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company recently held a conference of technical personnel representatives to discuss this year's savings plan and measures. The representatives attending the meeting resolved to save the country more than 1,500 tons of steel, more than 11,000 tons of cement, and more than 3,000 cubic meters of wood in this year's construction projects of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise.

This year, the workload of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company will double compared to last year. The construction of the coking and chemical plant, refractory material plant, sintering plant, iron-smelting blast furnace, and ore dressing plant, which are part of the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction projects it is responsible for, will all commence this year one after another. The representatives analyzed the characteristics of this year's projects and the construction conditions, and believed that although there were difficulties in terms of building materials, as long as they conscientiously summarized and absorbed last year's experiences and lessons, the potential for savings was still great.

Last year, the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company adopted various measures, promoted a number of new technologies, and launched a rationalization proposal campaign. Under the condition of extremely difficult building materials, it overfulfilled the annual plan and saved more than 1,000 tons of steel, more than 4,000 tons of cement, and more than 5,000 cubic meters of wood. When discussing this year's savings measures, the representatives divided the various new technologies that were effective last year and will be promoted this year into three categories: universally promoted, key promotion, and trial first and then strive for promotion. They also separately stipulated the requirements for improving quality and reducing costs when promoting these new technologies.

The meeting studied the focus of promoting new technologies this year, stipulating that this year's savings measures should focus on saving steel, wood, and cement. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on promoting prestressed concrete components, making full use of local raw materials as admixtures for concrete, and widely using bamboo, which is abundant in the South, to replace wood as formwork and scaffolding.

    推行新技术节约建筑材料
    武汉冶金建筑总公司作出节约计划
    新华社武汉27日电　武汉冶金建筑总公司最近召开技术人员代表会议，讨论了今年的节约计划和措施。参加会议的代表们，决议要在今年的武汉钢铁联合企业建筑工程中为国家节约一千五百多吨钢材，一万一千多吨水泥和三千多立方公尺木材。
    武汉冶金建筑总公司今年的工作量将比去年增加一倍。它所担负的武钢建设工程中的炼焦化工厂、耐火材料厂、烧结厂、炼铁高炉和选矿厂等，今年都将先后开工兴建。代表们分析了今年的工程特点和施工条件，认为虽然在建筑材料方面有着困难，但是只要认真总结和吸取去年的经验教训，节约的潜力还是很大的。
    去年武汉冶金建筑总公司曾经采取多种措施，推行多项新技术和开展合理化建议运动，在建筑材料十分困难的状况下超额完成了年度计划，并且节约了一千多吨钢材、四千多吨水泥和五千多立方公尺木材。代表们在讨论今年的节约措施的时候，把去年行之有效的和今年将要推行的各种新技术，分为普遍推行、重点推行和先试验再争取推行等三类，并且分别规定推行这些新技术时对提高质量和降低成本的要求。
    会议研究了今年推广新技术的重点，规定今年的节约措施应以节约钢材、木材、水泥为中心。因此，要着重推行预加应力混凝土构件，尽量利用当地原料作混凝土的掺合料，广泛使用南方盛产的竹材代替木材作模型板和脚手架。
