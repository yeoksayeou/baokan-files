    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 2nd. According to the Romanian News Agency: Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly, delivered a New Year's message to the Romanian people on New Year's Eve, 1956.
    The message said that the Romanian people had gloriously completed the year's tasks, and new factories and mines had appeared in the country. This will make the Romanian people's work more rewarding and their lives richer. Romania's great friend, the Soviet Union, is helping Romania with its construction.
    The message went on to say that some events occurred during 1956, some of which were unfortunate. These events tell us that the conspiracies that endanger peace have not stopped. The responsibility of the Romanian people in the future is to continue to work with all forces in the world against war, to wage an unremitting struggle for the victory of peace and to enable the people of all countries to obtain happiness.
