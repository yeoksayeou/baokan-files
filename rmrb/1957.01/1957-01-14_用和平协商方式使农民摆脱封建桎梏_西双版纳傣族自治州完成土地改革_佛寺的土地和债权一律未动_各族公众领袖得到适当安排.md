Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 12th -- The land reform carried out in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province through peaceful consultation has been completed in the last batch of areas. Thus, the land reform carried out in the one million four hundred thousand minority ethnic areas (excluding Yi and Tibetan areas) on the Yunnan border, has been fully completed.

The Dai region of Xishuangbanna entered feudal society at the end of the twelfth century. After liberation, the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, based on the wishes of the broad masses of the people of all ethnic groups, convened an enlarged meeting at the end of November 1955. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and combined with the specific conditions of Xishuangbanna, it was decided to carry out land reform in the Dai areas that had already entered feudal society and in some other ethnic areas through peaceful consultation, and a separate land reform regulation for the autonomous prefecture was drafted. After gaining experience from typical experiments in eight townships in Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, a people's representative conference of all ethnic groups was convened to formally approve the separate land reform regulation. In the summer and winter of 1956, the land reform was launched in two batches on the east and west banks of the Lancang River.

The Dai people of Xishuangbanna believe in Buddhism, and freedom of religious belief has been strictly protected in all areas during the land reform. The land and creditor's rights of all 500+ temples in the prefecture remained untouched. In addition, those who had been deceived into joining the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek troops in Burma were also given a share of land, which was managed by their families on their behalf, welcoming them to return to their homes.

In Menghai, Mengzhe and other places in Xishuangbanna, some villages with more cultivated land voluntarily sent some of the confiscated land to villages with less cultivated land for distribution, eliminating the historical divisions between villages. Some Dai peasants in some townships sent the confiscated land to Hani and Lahu peasants for distribution, enhancing the unity between the various ethnic groups.

After the completion of the land reform in the 117 townships with a population of 150,000 in the autonomous prefecture, over 90% of the population in these areas, who had previously been landless, received an average of 600 to 1,000 jin of yield per mu. The reform movement cultivated more than 8,500 rural activists, 582 advanced elements from various ethnic groups joined the Communist Party of China, and 1,938 outstanding young people from all ethnic groups joined the Communist Youth League. Now, the vast majority of townships in the Dai region have established Party and Youth League branches and grassroots political power. The peasants of all ethnic groups, who have broken free from the shackles of feudalism for the first time in centuries, are throwing themselves into production with unprecedented enthusiasm.

After the land reform, landlords and rich peasants who performed well were elected by the peasants as township people's representatives and members of the people's committee; those with difficult lives received care from the state. Public leaders of all ethnic groups who had connections with the masses have been given appropriate political arrangements, generally not lower than their original positions, and their living standards have not fallen compared to before the land reform.

In Xishuangbanna, there are also about 100,000 people of ethnic minorities living in remote mountainous areas. These ethnic groups have not yet developed into complete class societies, and will not go through the land reform movement, but will take the path of vigorously developing production under the support of the state, and gradually transition directly to socialist society.

    用和平协商方式使农民摆脱封建桎梏
    西双版纳傣族自治州完成土地改革
    佛寺的土地和债权一律未动　各族公众领袖得到适当安排
    新华社昆明12日电　云南省西双版纳傣族自治州采用和平协商方式进行的土地改革，已经在最后一批地区完成。至此，云南边疆一百四十万少数民族地区（不包括彝族和藏族地区）采用和平协商方式进行的土地改革，全部完成。
    西双版纳傣族地区，在十二世纪末期就进入了封建社会。解放以后，自治州人民委员会根据各族广大人民的愿望，在1955年11月底召开扩大会议，按照宪法规定，结合西双版纳具体情况，决定采用和平协商的方式，在已经进入封建社会的傣族地区和一部分其它民族地区进行土地改革，并且拟订了自治州土地改革单行条例。经过在版纳景洪八个乡典型试验取得经验后，又召开各族各界人民代表会议，正式通过了土地改革单行条例。在1956年的夏冬两季，土地改革分两批先后在澜沧江东西两岸展开。
    西双版纳傣族人民信仰佛教，各地在土地改革中严格地保护了宗教信仰自由，对全州五百多座佛寺的土地和债权一律不动。此外，对少数过去被骗参加逃缅蒋军的人员，也同样分给一份土地，由他们的家属代管，欢迎他们返回家园。
    在版纳勐海和勐遮等地，有些耕地多的村寨把没收的部分土地主动送给耕地少的村寨分配，消除了历史上遗留下来的村寨之间的隔阂。有些乡傣族农民把没收的土地送给哈尼族和拉祜族农民分配，增强了各民族之间的团结。
    土地改革在自治州的一百一十七个乡共十五万人口的地区完成以后，占这些地区人口90％以上过去无地的农民平均分得了六百到一千斤产量的土地。改革运动中锻炼出八千五百多个农村积极分子，有五百八十二个各民族中的先进分子参加了中国共产党，一千九百三十八个各族优秀青年加入了青年团。现在，傣族地区绝大多数的乡都建立起了党、团支部和基层政权。几百年来第一次挣脱封建桎梏的各族农民，正以空前未有的热情投入生产。
    土地改革后，领主、地主表现好的被农民选为乡人民代表和人民委员会委员；生活困难的得到国家照顾。各民族中同群众有联系的公众领袖在政治上都有了适当安排，一般不低于原有职务，生活水平没有比土地改革前降低。
    在西双版纳，还有约十万人口的少数民族居住在边远山区。这些民族还没有发展成完整的阶级社会，将不经过土地改革运动，而采取在国家扶持下，组织起来大力发展生产的途径，逐步地直接过渡到社会主义社会。
