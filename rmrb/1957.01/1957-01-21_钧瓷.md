    Jun Porcelain
    "Jun Porcelain" is a historical treasure, famous both at home and abroad, produced in Shenhou Town, Yuxian County, Henan Province. According to the "Yuxian County Gazetteer" and local artisan legends, "Jun Porcelain" gets its name from its production in Junzhou (the ancient name of Yuxian County). It originated in the Song Dynasty and was interrupted by the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty. The Song Dynasty was the era of Jun Porcelain's prosperity, with varieties including decorations and daily-use bowls, celadon plates, wine vessels, etc. The colors of the objects were vibrant and diverse, mainly vermilion red, emerald green, and eggplant purple. The red was like rouge, the green like emerald, and the purple like ink black, exceptionally exquisite and beautiful. The ancient manufacturing methods of "Jun Porcelain," especially the glaze recipe, were lost during the Ming Dynasty.

    The current "Jun Porcelain" was explored and created during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. Jun Porcelain saw further development in the late Qing Dynasty, with more than fifty manufacturers. During the Xuantong period, due to frequent wars, soldiers often robbed Jun Porcelain and residents' property in Shenhou. Residents fled to avoid the chaos of war, and Jun Porcelain suffered another decline. Only the Lu family in Shenhou retained the methods of manufacturing Jun Porcelain at that time. Currently, the old artisans Lu Guangdong, Lu Guangwen, and Xi Shaomeng are able to manufacture Jun Porcelain. The products they produce are mostly decorative items, with colors such as blue, gray, and pink. Regardless of color, variety, or quality, they are not as good as the products of the Song and Qing dynasties. However, the "Jun Blue" fired by the Lu family is still exquisite and elegant, and has been designated as an export product at the Guangdong Export Commodities Fair.

    At the end of November last year, the Ministry of Light Industry sent a "Jun Porcelain Investigation Team" composed of ceramic experts and Shen Mingyang, Director of the Hunan Industrial and Mining Experiment Institute, to Shenhou, Yuxian County, to investigate. Through on-site observation, they conducted scientific analysis and research on the firing methods of "Jun Porcelain," revealing the so-called "kiln transmutation" secret of "Jun Red" (red Jun Porcelain). In one trial firing, when the old artisan added charcoal to the furnace, he inadvertently dropped a piece of coke into the porcelain bottle blank, resulting in "Jun Red." It not only had red color, but also yellow, blue, purple, and other colors, which were exceptionally vibrant. Following this method, several more experiments were conducted, and "Jun Red" was obtained. This discovery provides valuable technical data for the future production of "Jun Red." According to expert surveys, all the raw materials required for "Jun Porcelain" can be obtained within Yuxian County, with abundant reserves and high quality. They can not only be used for making Jun Porcelain blanks, but also for manufacturing other high-grade porcelain. (Lian Jing, Gong Yuan, Ji Yao)

    钧瓷
    “钧瓷”是历史悠久、驰名中外的珍品，产于河南禹县神后镇。根据“禹县志”记载和当地老艺人传说，“钧瓷”因出产在钧州（禹县古名钧州）而得名。创始于宋代，至元末明初而中断。宋时为“钧瓷”的昌盛繁荣时代，种类有装饰品和日常使用的碗、青盘、酒器等。器物的色彩鲜艳而多样，主有要朱砂红、葱翠青、茄皮紫三种，色红如胭脂，青如葱翠，紫如墨黑，异常精致美观。古“钧瓷”的制造方法，特别是彩釉配方相传至明代中断。
    现今的“钧瓷”，是在清光绪年间摸索创造出来的。清末钧瓷又有发展，制造者达五十余家。宣统时，因兵火四起，官兵经常到神后劫掠钧瓷和居民财产，居民四处逃避兵乱，钧瓷再遭衰败，只是神后的卢家仍留传下当时制造钧瓷的方法。目前能制造钧瓷的有老艺人卢广东、卢广文、郗绍孟等三人，制出的产品多系装饰品。色彩有蓝、灰、粉红等色。无论色彩、品种、质量都不及宋代和清代产品。但卢家烧的“钧蓝”还是精致雅观的，已在广东出口商品展览会上被确定为出口产品。
    去年11月底，轻工业部派陶瓷专家、湖南工矿试验所沈明扬所长等组成的“钧瓷考查组”到禹县神后去考查。通过实地观察，对“钧瓷”的烧炼方法进行了科学的分析研究，揭开了“钧红”（红色钧瓷）的所谓“窑变”的秘密。在一次试炼过程中，老艺人向炉中添炭时，无意之间把一块焦炭掉进瓷瓶的坯子中去，结果烧成“钧红”，不仅有红色，而且有黄、蓝、紫等色，异常鲜艳。依照这个方法又试验了几次，都得到了“钧红”。这一发现为今后生产“钧红”提供了宝贵的技术资料。据专家调查，“钧瓷”所需的一切原料，在禹县境内都能取得，藏量丰富，质量高，不仅能供钧瓷制坯用，还能制造别的高级瓷器。（连晶　公远　继尧）
