Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 11th: According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper, the Yugoslav troops of the UN Emergency Force, which entered Al-Arish Airport on the 9th, were forced to withdraw on the morning of the 10th because the Israeli army headquarters did not allow the troops to enter Al-Arish city. The Yugoslav troops have retreated to a place four kilometers east of the city.

UN Emergency Force Commander Burns, after meeting with Israeli Army Chief of Staff Dayan on the 9th, announced that Israel had agreed to retreat another twenty-five kilometers by January 15th, including the city of Al-Arish in this area. However, disregarding the UN General Assembly's resolution on immediately withdrawing to the 1949 armistice line, Israel still refuses to withdraw from Sharm el-Sheikh at the entrance of the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 11th: "Al-Ahram" reported on the 10th that a British force is still stationed on the Egyptian island of Tiran. Tiran Island is located at the entrance of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea and is currently still occupied by Israel.

    以色列悍然抗交阿里希城
    联合国紧急部队被迫撤回
    英军仍窃据埃及领土蒂朗岛
    据新华社开罗11日电　据“金字塔报”报道，9日开进阿里希机场的联合国紧急部队的南斯拉夫部队被迫在10日上午撤回，因为以色列军队司令部不让这支部队进入阿里希城。南斯拉夫部队已经撤退到这个城市以东四公里的地方。
    联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯9日在同以色列军队参谋长达扬会谈后宣布，以色列答应到1月15日再后撤二十五公里，在这个地区中包括阿里希城。但是，以色列不顾联合国大会关于立即撤退到1949年停战线后面的决议，仍然拒绝撤出亚喀巴湾入口处的沙姆沙伊赫和加沙地带。
    据新华社开罗11日电　“金字塔报”10日报道，一支英国部队仍然驻在埃及的蒂朗岛上。蒂朗岛位于红海中的亚喀巴湾的入口，目前仍被以色列占领着。
