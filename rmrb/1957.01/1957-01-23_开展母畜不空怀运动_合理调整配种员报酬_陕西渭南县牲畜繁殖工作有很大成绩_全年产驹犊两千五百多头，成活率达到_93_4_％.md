    (News from this newspaper) Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, achieved significant success in livestock breeding in 1956, becoming a "Livestock Abundance County."

    After basically achieving agricultural cooperativization last year, many agricultural cooperatives felt a shortage of draft animals. In response to this situation, the Weinan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the experience of "No Empty Pregnancy for Female Livestock" piloted in Tian Market Township, formulated a county-wide livestock breeding plan. The plan required that 90% of the county's eligible female livestock be bred, 85% conceive, and the survival rate reach over 95%. To accomplish this plan, the County Committee mobilized all agricultural cooperatives to comprehensively launch a "No Empty Pregnancy" campaign for female livestock and a "Livestock Breeding and Reproduction Shock Month," universally promoting the signing of "Guarantee Breeding and Guarantee Pregnancy" contracts between inseminators and agricultural cooperatives, and rationally adjusting the labor remuneration of inseminators and breeders. Over the past year, significant achievements have been made in livestock breeding work. As of December 20, 1956, out of the county's 11,670 eligible female livestock, 9,568 had been bred, accounting for over 80% of the total number of eligible female livestock; among them, 7,834 female livestock actually conceived, accounting for 82% of the bred livestock; and 2,576 foals and calves were produced throughout the year, with a survival rate of 93.4%.

    At the recent County Labor Model Congress of Agriculture, Forestry, Water Conservancy, and Animal Husbandry, a group of animal husbandry models or model units with significant achievements in livestock breeding were rewarded. This will play a significant role in promoting the continued development of livestock breeding work. (Meng Jianben)

    开展母畜不空怀运动　合理调整配种员报酬
    陕西渭南县牲畜繁殖工作有很大成绩
    全年产驹犊两千五百多头，成活率达到93.4％
    本报讯　陕西省渭南县1956年的牲畜繁殖工作有了很大成绩，成为“畜牧丰产县”。
    这个县，在去年基本实现农业合作化以后，许多农业社感到耕畜不足。针对这一情况，中共渭南县委会根据在田市乡试行的“母畜不空怀”的经验，制定了全县牲畜繁殖计划。要求全县适龄母畜90％配种、85％受胎、成活率要达到95％以上。为了完成这一计划，县委发动所有农业社全面展开了“母畜不空怀”运动和“牲畜配种繁殖突击运动月”，普遍推行了配种员和农业社签订“保配保怀”的配种合同，并合理地调整了配种员、饲养员的劳动报酬。一年来，牲畜繁殖工作已经取得了很大成绩。截至1956年12月20日为止，全县适龄母畜一万一千六百七十头，已配种的就有九千五百六十八头，占适龄母畜总数的80％以上；其中实际受胎的母畜达七千八百三十四头，占配种牲畜数的82％；全年已产驹犊两千五百七十六头，成活率为93.4％。
    最近县里召开的农、林、水、牧劳动模范大会上奖励了一批繁殖牲畜有显著成绩的畜牧模范或畜牧模范单位。这对继续开展牲畜繁殖工作将起很大的推动作用。（孟建本）
