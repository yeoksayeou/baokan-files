Xinhua News Agency, 27th: A "Literary Tea House," soon to officially open in Beijing, began receiving guests yesterday afternoon. The "Literary Tea House" is another name for the service department of the literary club organized by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

　　Simplicity and elegance are the characteristics of this "tea house." In a small room, carriage seats are arranged around the perimeter, and the tables are adorned with vibrant poinsettias and budding daffodils. It was designed by an artist who wishes to remain anonymous.

　　Dozens of well-known figures from the literary and art world spent their weekend here.

　　The hosts—Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and A Ying, Deputy Secretary-General—were chatting with the dramatists Ouyang Yuqian and Zhang Geng. Wu Xue, Deputy Director of the Welfare Department of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and Li Chao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Dramatists Association, had a long conversation with the Peking opera actress Du Liyun, expressing their deep concern for this veteran artist who was famous twenty years ago. The renowned storytelling performers Lian Kuoru and Han Qixiang were talking in another corner. A pair of good brothers—artists Zhang Guangyu and Zhang Zhengyu—sat around a table with cartoonists Hua Junwu and Ding Cong, and everyone was often brought to bursts of laughter by Hua Junwu's "cartoon-style" language. A group of artists who are participating in the selection work of the National Youth Art Exhibition also rushed over, and the most active among them was the female painter Yu Feng. As soon as she arrived, she praised a waitress's short jacket, saying that the color was adorably red. Someone laughed at her for being "inseparable from her profession," because she is also a famous clothing design expert. The dancer Wu Xiaobang also joined in, asking the artists to design costumes for a newly created dance. Zhou Qihe, a Sichuan opera actor who is currently filming a movie in Beijing, received a young reporter here and enthusiastically answered many questions raised by the reporter. The performing arts of the Chengdu Sichuan Opera Troupe, which recently arrived in Beijing, are the topic of conversation for a group of Sichuan opera fans. Wu Xue especially praised the three plays that the troupe is about to perform: "A Shoe," "Tan Jier," and "Spring Lantern Riddles," because he has already seen the rehearsals.

　　The "Literary Tea House" will open on the 28th, and it is being held to facilitate gatherings and rest for people in the literary and art world.

    “文艺茶馆”
    新华社27日讯　即将在北京正式开张的一个“文艺茶馆”，昨天下午开始招待客人。“文艺茶馆”是中国文学艺术界联合会举办的文艺俱乐部服务部的别名。
    朴素、雅致是这个“茶馆”的特色。一间不大的房子里，周围设置着车厢座，桌子上放着鲜艳的一品红和含苞欲放的水仙花。这是一位不肯公布他的名字的美术家设计的。
    几十位著名的文艺界人士在这儿度过周末。
    这儿的主人——中国文学艺术界联合会秘书长阳翰笙和副秘书长阿英在和戏剧家欧阳予倩、张庚闲谈。中国戏剧家协会福利部副主任委员吴雪和中国戏剧家协会副秘书长李超在这里和京剧女演员杜丽云作了一次长谈，他们对这位二十年前名重一时的老艺人表示了深切的关怀。著名的曲艺演员连阔如、韩起祥等人在另外一个角落里谈天。一对老在一块的好兄弟——美术家张光宇、张正宇，同漫画家华君武、丁聪等人围坐在一桌，大家不时被华君武的“漫画式”的语言引得失声大笑。正在参加全国青年美术作品展览会评选工作的一批美术家也赶来了，他们中间最活跃的是女画家郁风。她一来就夸奖一位女服务员的短袄，说这颜色红得可爱。有人笑她“三句不离本行”，因为她又是出名的服装设计专家。舞蹈家吴晓邦也参加进来，请美术家们为一个新创作的舞蹈设计服装。正在北京拍摄电影的川剧演员周企何在这里接待了一位青年记者，他热心地回答了记者提出的许多问题。最近到达北京的成都市川剧团的表演艺术是一群川剧迷的话题，吴雪特别推许这个剧团将要公演的三个剧目：“一只鞋”、“谭记儿”和“春灯谜”，因为他已经看过彩排了。
    “文艺茶馆”将在28日开张，它是为便于文艺界人士聚会、休息而举办的。
