Shaanxi - Since the beginning of winter, Shaanxi Province has launched province-wide anti-subjectivism study.

During this period, leadership departments in various regions have dispatched work teams to grassroots organizations to understand the situation. The Hanzhong region's counties alone sent over 100 work teams, delving into the masses to investigate issues in agricultural production and financial and trade work. They fully promoted democracy during the investigations, listening to the masses' opinions on various tasks.

After investigation and research, the minds of leaders and staff at all levels became clearer, recognizing the harm that subjectivism brought to their work.

In the anti-subjectivism study, various regions generally implemented the principle of "study while inspecting, inspect while improving." For example, in areas such as Ankang and Hanzhong, after discovering that low prices for local specialties were affecting farmers' production enthusiasm, they immediately proposed adjustments to the prices of more than 20 products, including live pigs, rapeseed, ginger, turmeric, and tea. After the work inspections, many county-level cadres at the section chief and bureau chief level went deep into the grassroots to conduct investigation and research, strengthening specific leadership. Some investigated winter production conditions, while others researched this year's agricultural production targets. For example, the Lintong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in order to make plans more reliable, had its director lead a work team to the grassroots to investigate the masses' demands for material supplies and the status of local products, and then formulated purchasing and sales plans based on the investigated situation.

Currently, the development of anti-subjectivism study in Shaanxi Province is still uneven. Judging from the overall provincial situation, leadership units below the county level have conducted more thorough inspections, while those at the special district level and above, especially provincial-level leadership departments, have not inspected sufficiently. Some departments have not even taken effective action. For example, in departments such as agricultural production, culture, education, health, finance, and trade, staff at all levels below the county have inspected problems in their work, but the relevant provincial-level departments have not inspected, making it difficult for the lower levels to handle the issues, which has caused dissatisfaction among many staff members. If the anti-subjectivism campaign in provincial-level leadership departments can be better developed, it will further deepen the province's study of anti-subjectivism, bureaucracy, and commandism.

    陕西各地领导部门深入调查情况
    检查工作结合反主观主义学习
    本报讯　入冬以来，陕西省全省开展了反主观主义的学习。
    在这一时期，各地领导部门都派出了工作组深入基层组织了解情况，汉中地区各县共派出一百多个工作组，深入到群众中去调查农业生产和财贸工作中的问题。在调查中充分发扬了民主，倾听群众对各种工作的意见。
    经过调查研究后，使各级领导人员和工作人员的头脑比较清醒了，认识到主观主义给工作带来的危害。
    各地在反主观主义学习中，一般地都贯彻了边学习、边检查、边改进的方针。如在安康、汉中等地区，在检查出因收购土特产价格偏低而影响农民生产情绪之后，立即对生猪、菜籽、姜黄、茶叶等二十多种产品价格提出了调整的方案。在检查工作之后，很多县的科长部长以上的干部都深入到基层去进行调查研究工作，加强具体领导，有的调查研究冬季生产的情况，有的调查研究今年农业生产的指标问题等。例如临潼县供销合作社，为了使计划订得可靠些，由主任带领工作组到基层去，调查群众对物资供应的要求和土产品的情况，根据所调查的情况订出购销的计划。
    目前陕西省反主观主义学习开展得还不平衡，从全省情况看，县以下领导单位检查得较为深刻，专区以上特别是省级领导部门检查得不够，有些部门甚至还没有很好的行动起来。例如在农业生产、文教卫生、财贸等部门中，县以下的各级工作人员对工作中的问题都检查了，但是，省级有关部门没有检查，下边就不好处理，因此引起了很多工作人员的不满。如果省级各领导部门反主观主义能够更好地开展起来，将会使全省反主观主义、官僚主义和命令主义的学习更深入一步。
