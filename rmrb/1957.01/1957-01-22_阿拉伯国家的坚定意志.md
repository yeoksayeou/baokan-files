Observer's Commentary

    The leaders of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan held an important meeting in Cairo on January 18th and 19th. They discussed and studied the current situation in the Middle East and expressed unanimous opinions on the main issues concerning the Middle East in the communique issued after the meeting. The convening of this meeting and its results prominently demonstrate the firm will of the Arab countries to unite, support each other, and continue to work to repel Western colonial forces in the struggle to win and maintain national independence and sovereignty.

    The leaders of the four Arab countries unanimously condemned the occupation of a part of Egyptian territory by Israeli troops as "a continuation of the joint aggression by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, and believe that this poses the most serious consequences for the Middle East region." As everyone knows, although the British and French aggression against Egypt has completely failed, the Western colonial countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, are still using Israel's delay in withdrawing its troops to continue to play with the conspiracy of infringing upon Egypt's territorial sovereignty and threatening peace in the Middle East. The United Nations General Assembly adopted the proposal of the twenty-five Asian and African countries with an overwhelming majority on January 19th, once again ordering Israel to withdraw its troops from Egypt within a limited time. As other Arab countries closely related to Egypt, it is only natural to continue to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people to safeguard their territorial sovereignty. The participants of the Cairo meeting also expressed their support for the struggle of the Yemeni people against British aggression and the struggle of the Algerian people against French colonial rule. They also decided that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria would jointly bear the annual financial aid of 12.5 million pounds to Jordan to help Jordan abolish the unequal British-Jordanian treaty. This is a major support for the Jordanian people in their struggle for and maintenance of independence.

    Faced with the new threat of aggression from American colonialists, the leaders of the four Arab countries announced the common determination of the Arab people to defend their national independence and unanimously refuted the fallacy of the so-called Middle East "vacuum" of the United States. At the same time, they expressed "the determination to never allow their countries to become spheres of influence of any foreign country" and believed that "Arab nationalism is the only basis for formulating Arab policies." This is a firm answer from the Arab people to the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The United States originally wanted to use the unfounded so-called "Soviet threat to the Middle East" as a smokescreen to peddle the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to the Arab countries in the Middle East, but lies cannot deceive people. The communique of the four-nation Arab meeting shows that the people of the Middle Eastern countries clearly understand who their enemies are and who their friends are in the struggle to win and maintain independent sovereignty. Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said it well: the American "so-called threat of Soviet infiltration into the Arab homeland is just an excuse to cover up interference in the affairs of the Arab world."

    The four-nation Arab meeting shows that although the American ruling clique is still dreaming of dominating the Middle East, and although it has proposed a arrogant plan to invade the Middle East, it is by no means the American colonialists, but the people of the Middle East and Arab countries themselves, who determine the fate of the Middle East and Arab countries today. With the continued support of the peace forces of the world, the unity of the people of the Middle East and Arab countries will surely completely smash Washington's new colonial plan and smash the heinous "Eisenhower Doctrine"!

### 阿拉伯国家的坚定意志

    阿拉伯国家的坚定意志
    埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦等四国领导人，在1月18日和19日在开罗举行了重要会议，他们对目前中东局势进行了讨论和研究，并在会后发表的公报中，对有关中东的主要问题表示了一致的意见。这个会议的召开和它的结果，突出地表现了阿拉伯国家在争取和维护民族独立主权的斗争中，团结一致，互相支援，继续为击退西方殖民势力而努力的坚决意志。
    阿拉伯四国领导人一致谴责以色列军队对于埃及一部分领土的占领，“是英、法、以三国共同侵略行为的继续，并认为这使中东地区面临着最严重的后果”。大家知道，英法对埃及的侵略虽然已经彻底失败，但是，美英法等西方殖民国家仍在利用以色列的拖延撤军，继续玩弄着侵犯埃及领土主权和威胁中东和平的阴谋。联合国大会已于1月19日以压倒的多数通过了亚非二十五国的提案，再一次限令以色列从埃及撤军。作为同埃及休戚相关的其他阿拉伯国家，继续支持埃及人民维护领土主权的正义斗争，是很自然的。开罗会议的参加者对也门人民反对英国侵略的斗争，对阿尔及利亚人民反抗法国殖民统治的斗争，同样表示支持。他们还决定由埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚三国共同负担对约旦每年一千二百五十万英镑的财政援助，以帮助约旦废除英国—约旦不平等条约。这是对争取和维护独立的约旦人民的一个重大支持。
    面对着来自美国殖民者的新的侵略威胁，阿拉伯四国领导人宣布了阿拉伯人民保卫自己民族独立的共同决心，一致驳斥了美国所谓中东“真空”的谬论。他们同时表示“决心永远不让他们的国家成为任何外国的势力范围”；并认为“阿拉伯民族主义是制订阿拉伯政策的唯一基础”。这是阿拉伯人民对于“艾森豪威尔主义”的一个坚定的回答。美国本想以莫须有的所谓“苏联对中东的威胁”作为烟幕，来向中东阿拉伯国家兜售“艾森豪威尔主义”，可是谎言是欺骗不了人的。阿拉伯四国会议公报表明，中东国家人民清楚地懂得谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们在争取和维护独立主权斗争中的朋友。叙利亚外交部长比塔尔说得好，美国的“所谓苏联渗入阿拉伯祖国的威胁，不过是为干涉阿拉伯世界的事务进行掩饰的借口而已”。
    阿拉伯四国会议表明，尽管美国统治集团仍然做着独霸中东的迷梦，尽管它目空一切地提出了侵略中东的狂妄计划，但是今天决定中东和阿拉伯各国命运的决不是美国殖民主义者，而是中东和阿拉伯各国人民自己。在全世界和平力量的继续支持下，中东阿拉伯各国人民的团结一致，一定能够彻底粉碎华盛顿的新的殖民计划，粉碎万恶的“艾森豪威尔主义”！
