    The Development of the South Korean People's Struggle
    Shen Fugen, Korea
    The South Korean people's struggle against the fascist rule of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland has greatly developed in the past year.
    The Syngman Rhee clique faithfully implements the aggressive policies of the United States, constantly clamors for "northward advance," and intensifies its arms expansion and war preparations. To date, the South Korean army has expanded to thirty-one divisions, which is almost double the sixteen divisions at the time of the Korean armistice. The ever-increasing military burden falls on the suffering South Korean people. At the same time, the colonial exploitation of American monopoly capital has also intensified, causing a tragic situation of economic ruin in South Korea. According to figures released by the Syngman Rhee clique, in the Seoul area of South Korea, there were originally 1,406 factories of various kinds, including handicraft factories. However, in 1955 alone, 954 of these factories went bankrupt, declined, or closed down due to lack of funds, raw materials, electricity, and sales. In North Gyeongsang Province, 55% of manufacturing enterprises had stopped production by the end of July 1956. Of the 130 factories in the Incheon area, 95% were shut down by the end of 1955. The crippled industry has led to a continuous increase in unemployment, and the working conditions of employed workers have also deteriorated drastically. For example, the workers of the Eunseong Coal Mine, which belongs to the "Daehan Coal Corporation" that monopolizes the South Korean coal industry, can only receive 0.45 kilograms of food per day. The dockworkers in South Korean ports not only have extremely low wages, but are also often deducted from and not paid their wages. In the first five months of last year, they had not received 75% of their due wages. However, working hours are getting longer and longer. According to a survey conducted by the "Ministry of Health and Social Affairs" of the Syngman Rhee puppet government on ninety-eight transportation companies in South Korea in November last year, workers are usually forced to work more than twelve hours a day, and there is no compensation for overtime work. Workers in American military bases also suffer from barbaric racial oppression and discrimination.
    Due to this unbearable situation, South Korean workers, regardless of the suppression by the American and Rhee military police and secret agents, often hold strikes and go-slow struggles to oppose slave-like servitude. In recent months, construction workers at the Mungyeong Cement Factory, workers at the Incheon U.S. Army Oil Supply Station, and sailors of Busan First Commercial Shipping Company have all held strikes demanding higher wages. More than 500 workers at the Mungyeong Cement Factory also put forward seven demands, including opposing the issuance of starvation wages by American contractors and implementing an eight-hour work system. Workers of the Andong Railway in North Gyeongsang Province and more than 400 workers of the "Daehan Textile Company" Daegu Factory held demonstrations to protest the Syngman Rhee clique's interruption of food rations and illegal suppression of workers. At the same time, led by more than 8,000 workers belonging to the "Daehan Coal Corporation," workers in various parts of South Korea extensively launched protest movements and go-slow struggles against harsh working conditions and low wages. Dockworkers in Busan and Incheon, construction workers at the Chungju Fertilizer Factory, and workers at the Busan Factory of the Joseon Textile Company have all taken action. Dockworkers at the Port of Incheon and workers at U.S. rear bases in Bupyeong and other places, who work under the pressure of American bayonets, have also joined this struggle.
    South Korean farmers launched a struggle against the predatory grain requisitioning and other cruel exploitation by the American and Rhee bandits. The Syngman Rhee clique's "grain requisitioning" and "purchasing" plans from the autumn of the previous year to the summer of last year failed to be completed due to the resistance of the farmers. During last year's "purchasing" of summer grains, the Syngman Rhee clique mobilized "supervision teams" and "gangs" to rob farmers of their grain. But even so, the amount of collection originally scheduled to be completed by the end of August was only 54% realized by September 15. Currently, the Syngman Rhee clique is forcibly "purchasing" autumn grains, but as of November 10, only 0.9% of the "purchasing" plan has been realized.
    The Syngman Rhee clique's criminal act of seizing farmers' land to build American military bases has been met with even stronger resistance from the farmers. According to the South Korean "Dong-A Ilbo," when the Syngman Rhee clique seized more than 100,000 pyeong of farmland in Changwon County, South Gyeongsang Province, to be used as a military training ground, more than 1,000 local farmers gathered at the "myeon office" (myeon is equivalent to a district) and launched a major "disturbance." Similar struggles have also occurred in Daejeong-myeon on Jeju Island, Bugaedong, Ilsindong, and Gusan-dong in Incheon City.
    The South Korean people have also launched a struggle to refuse to pay taxes, which has made it more difficult for the Syngman Rhee clique to collect war expenses. The Syngman Rhee clique's tax collection in 1955 only reached 65% of the predetermined amount, and as of the end of September last year, there were still 9 billion hwan uncollected.
    The young people of South Korea expressed their desire for peaceful reunification of the motherland with powerful actions to resist the Syngman Rhee clique's conscription. This resistance struggle is intensifying year by year. According to statistics from the Syngman Rhee puppet police authorities, in 1954, 31% of South Korean youths evaded conscription, and this increased to 43.3% in 1955. Among the students who graduated from South Korean universities in 1955, more than 80% evaded compulsory conscription. According to figures recently admitted by the South Korean authorities, among those of conscription age recruited last year, more than 50,000 young adults refused to join the puppet army.
    According to South Korean newspapers, students are constantly holding strikes to oppose the Syngman Rhee clique's "conscription" and to oppose enslaved education. In the recent months alone, students from many schools, including Seoul Dental College, Incheon College of Engineering, Seoul Dongdo High School, Yeongdeungpo Industrial High School, Yeongju Agricultural High School in North Gyeongsang Province, Sintaein Commercial High School in North Jeolla Province, and Gunbuk Middle School in North Jeolla Province, have held strikes. It is particularly noteworthy that even the Syngman Rhee clique's so-called "National Aviation University" has experienced a strike.
    The desire for peaceful reunification of the motherland is also growing within the Syngman Rhee puppet army. The increasing number of Syngman Rhee puppet army officers and soldiers who have defected to the northern half of the Republic clearly illustrates this point. The defectors unanimously pointed out that war-weariness is growing within the Syngman Rhee puppet army, and desertion is increasing daily.
    In the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and for the rights to survival and democracy, the South Korean people are greatly encouraged by the consistent policy of peaceful reunification of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the free and happy life of the people in the northern half of Korea. Based on its unwavering policy of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continues to advocate political consultations between North and South Korea to seek peaceful reunification, and demands the development of economic and cultural exchanges and free travel and mutual contact between the peoples of the North and South. The Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, held in April last year, also adopted a declaration on the peaceful reunification of the motherland, reiterating the unanimous desire of all Korean people: the Korean issue must be resolved on the basis of the democratic will of the Korean people. To achieve this goal, the Labor Party and the Republic's government have put forward a series of reasonable and concrete plans.
    This measure has been enthusiastically supported by the South Korean people. Regardless of the frantic persecution by the Syngman Rhee military police and secret agents, South Korean patriots often distribute leaflets among the people, calling on the people to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. This kind of leaflet even appeared on the roof of the Mokpo Police Station in South Jeolla Province.
    More and more people are openly opposing Syngman Rhee. In the illegal elections held in May last year under the control of the Syngman Rhee clique using terrorist means, the number of votes against Syngman Rhee increased to 4.03 million, which is almost one and a half times more than in 1952. On May 5 last year, large-scale demonstrations against the traitorous rule of the Syngman Rhee clique also appeared in Seoul and Busan.
    The rising sentiment of the people demanding peaceful reunification of the motherland has affected South Korean politicians. Regardless of the suppression by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, a movement to organize new political parties with the peaceful reunification of the motherland as their platform has emerged in South Korean political circles. The newly formed "Progressive Party" put forward the proposition of "peaceful reunification" in its program. Currently, the "Democratic Innovation Party," which is being prepared for establishment by people from all walks of life in South Korea, has also expressed its intention to "unify the motherland in a democratic way."
    All efforts by the South Korean people and patriots to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland will be developed more forcefully with the support of the entire Korean people.

    南朝鲜人民斗争的发展
    朝鲜　申富根
    南朝鲜人民反对美国和李承晚集团的法西斯统治，争取祖国和平统一的斗争，在过去一年中有了很大的发展。
    李承晚集团忠实地执行美国的侵略政策，不断叫嚣“北进”，变本加厉地扩军备战。到目前为止，南朝鲜军队已扩充到三十一个师，这比朝鲜停战时的十六个师差不多增加了一倍。越来越大的军事负担落到了苦难深重的南朝鲜人民身上。同时，美国垄断资本的殖民压榨也日益加重，在南朝鲜造成了百业雕敝的悲惨情况。据李承晚集团发表的数字，在南朝鲜的汉城地区，原来有包括手工业工厂在内的各种工厂一千四百零六家，但是，在1955年一年中，这些工厂中有九百五十四家因为缺乏资金、原料、电力和商品没有销路而破产、没落或倒闭。在庆尚北道，1956年7月末有55％的制造工业企业停止了生产。仁川地区的一百三十个工厂，1955年年底时95％停了工。工业残破使得失业者不断增加，在业工人的劳动条件也极端恶化。举例来说，垄断着南朝鲜煤炭工业的“大韩煤炭公司”所属的恩城煤矿的工人们，一天只能领到零点四五公斤的食粮。南朝鲜的各港湾的码头工人们，不但工资额极低，而且经常被扣克不发。去年头五个月，他们还没有领到应领工资的75％。但是，劳动时间却越来越长了。据李承晚伪政府的“保健社会部”去年11月对南朝鲜各地的九十八个运输公司所作的调查，工人们通常是被迫每天工作十二小时以上，而且加班的劳动没有报酬。在美国军事基地工作的工人，还要遭受横蛮的种族压迫和歧视。
    由于这种活不下去的情况，南朝鲜工人不顾美李军警、特务的压制，为了反对奴隶式的奴役而时常举行罢工和怠工的斗争。在最近几个月中，闻庆水泥工厂的建设工人、仁川美军油类补给站的工人和釜山第一商船股份公司的船员们，都举行了要求提高工资的罢工。闻庆水泥工厂的五百多名工人并提出了反对美国包工企业发给饥饿工资、实行八小时工作制等七项要求。庆尚北道安东铁道的工人和“大韩纺织公司”大丘工厂的四百余名工人，为了反对李承晚集团中断食粮配给和对工人施行非法的镇压行为，举行了示威。同时以“大韩煤炭公司”所属的八千余名工人为首，南朝鲜各地工人广泛地展开了反对苛刻的劳动条件和低微工资的抗议运动和怠工斗争。釜山和仁川的码头工人，忠州肥料工厂的建设工人和朝鲜纺织公司釜山工厂的工人们，都采取了行动。在美军刺刀压迫下工作的仁川港码头工人和富平等处的美军后方基地的工人，也卷入了这一斗争。
    南朝鲜农民展开了反对美李匪帮掠夺性的征粮和其他残酷剥削的斗争。李承晚集团从前年秋天到去年夏天的“征粮”和“收购”计划，都因农民的抗拒而未能完成。在去年“收购”夏谷时，李承晚集团曾经动员“督促班”和“暴力团”来劫夺农民的粮食。但即使这样，他们原定8月底完成的征收量，到9月15日还只实现54％。目前李承晚集团正在强迫“收购”秋粮，可是，到11月10日为止，仅仅实现了“收购”计划的0.9％。
    李承晚集团强夺农民土地来修建美国军事基地的罪恶行动，遭到了农民更强烈的反抗。据南朝鲜的“东亚日报”报道，李承晚集团在庆尚南道昌原郡掠夺十万多坪农田作为军事训练场时，当地一千多名农民聚集在“面事务所”（面相当于区）掀起了一场大“骚动”。同样的斗争也先后发生在济州岛大井面、仁川市的富开洞、日新洞、龟山洞等处。
    南朝鲜人民还展开了拒绝纳税的斗争，这使李承晚集团搜括战争费用更加困难。李承晚集团1955年的税金征收额，只达到了预定额的65％，截止去年9月末，没有征收到的还有九十亿圜。
    南朝鲜的青年们用抗拒李承晚集团征兵的有力行动来表示他们要求和平统一祖国的愿望。这种抗拒斗争正在一年年加剧。据李承晚伪警察当局的统计，1954年，南朝鲜青年有31％逃避征集，而1955年增加到了43.3％。1955年毕业的南朝鲜各大学的学生中，逃避强制征集的达80％以上。据最近南朝鲜当局承认的数字，在去年征集的适龄者中，拒绝加入伪军的青壮年有五万多名。
    据南朝鲜的报刊透露，学生们因为反对李承晚集团的“征集”和反对奴化教育，不断地举行罢课。仅在最近的几个月间，就有汉城齿科大学，仁川的工科大学，汉城东都高等学校、永登浦工业高等学校、庆尚北道荣州农业高等学校、全罗北道新泰仁商业高等学校、全罗北道郡北中学校等许多学校的学生们举行了罢课。特别值得指出的是，连李承晚集团的所谓“国立航空大学”也发生了罢课。
    和平统一祖国的愿望在李承晚伪军内部也日益增长。起义来共和国北半部的李伪军官兵日益增多的事实，就清楚地说明这一点。起义者们一致指出，在李承晚伪军的内部增长着厌战思想，开小差的也与日俱增。
    南朝鲜人民在争取祖国和平统一、争取生存权利和民主权利的斗争中，从朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府始终不渝的和平统一政策和朝鲜北半部人民的自由幸福的生活，得到很大的鼓舞。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府从它的和平解决朝鲜问题的坚定不移的政策出发，继续主张南北朝鲜之间举行政治协商来谋求和平统一，并且要求发展南北人民之间的经济和文化交流和自由来往、相互接触。去年4月召开的朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会，又通过了和平统一祖国的宣言，再度阐明全体朝鲜人民的一致愿望：朝鲜问题必须在朝鲜人民的民主意志的基础上求得解决。为了实现这个目的，劳动党和共和国政府提出了一系列的合理的具体的方案。
    这个措施得到了南朝鲜人民的热烈拥护。不顾李承晚军警、特务的疯狂迫害，南朝鲜的爱国人士经常在人民中散布传单，号召人民为祖国的和平统一而斗争。这种传单甚至出现在全罗南道木浦警察署的房顶上。
    公开反对李承晚的人也越来越多了。去年5月，在李承晚集团用恐怖手段控制下举行的非法选举中，反对李承晚的票数，增加到了四百零三万票，这比1952年增加了将近一倍半。去年5月5日，汉城和釜山还出现了反对李承晚集团的卖国统治的大规模的示威。
    人民要求祖国和平统一的高涨情绪，对南朝鲜政界人士发生了影响。不顾美国和李承晚集团的镇压，南朝鲜政界已出现了以祖国和平统一为自己纲领的组织新政党的运动。新组成的“进步党”，就在它的纲领中提出了“和平统一”的主张。目前，南朝鲜各界人士正在准备建立的“民主革新党”，也表示要“以民主方式统一祖国”。
    南朝鲜人民和爱国人士促进祖国和平统一的一切努力，必将在全体朝鲜人民的支持下，更有力地发展起来。
