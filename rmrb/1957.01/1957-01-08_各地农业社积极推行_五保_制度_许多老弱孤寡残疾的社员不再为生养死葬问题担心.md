Agricultural Cooperatives in Various Regions Actively Implement the "Five Guarantees" System
Many Elderly, Weak, Orphaned, Widowed, and Disabled Cooperative Members No Longer Worry About Issues of Life, Sustenance, Death, and Burial

(By our reporter) Since last year, the vast majority of advanced agricultural production cooperatives in all provinces, regions, and municipalities directly under the central government have successively implemented the "Five Guarantees" system for elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled cooperative members who lack labor or have completely lost their ability to work and have no means of support. The "Five Guarantees" include guaranteeing food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial. In Shandong Province, as early as before the wheat harvest last year, 30% of the townships had implemented the "Five Guarantees," 40% of the townships combined the summer harvest pre-distribution with the evaluation of "Five Guarantees" households, and the remaining 30% of the townships, although they had not evaluated or the evaluation work was not perfect, the cooperative members who should enjoy the "Five Guarantees" also received pre-distributed grain, guaranteeing their lives, and carried out or rectified the "Five Guarantees" work before and after the autumn harvest. Some elementary agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province have also promoted the "Five Guarantees" work. Last year in Guangdong Province, more than 80,000 households enjoyed the "Five Guarantees" treatment in advanced agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for about 40% of the total number of households in the province that should enjoy the "Five Guarantees" (the elementary cooperatives have not yet implemented the "Five Guarantees"). In Fengcheng, Huanren, Kuandian, Xinbin, Xingcheng, Kaiyuan, Jianping, Yingkou, Fuxin, Changtu, and other ten counties in Liaoning Province, the "Five Guarantees" work of most agricultural cooperatives has been evaluated down to the household level.

In provinces and regions where the cooperative movement has developed relatively slowly, the "Five Guarantees" system has also been actively promoted. For example, in Huali District of Kaiyang County, Guizhou Province, during the autumn harvest distribution, a total of more than 41,000 jin of grain, more than 1,000 yuan in cash, and some cloth were subsidized to 112 "Five Guarantees" households, ensuring their food and clothing. In Yuepu Lake County of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the income of more than 600 "Five Guarantees" households in 52 cooperatives increased compared to 1955.

When determining the "Five Guarantees" objects, most places are based on the three conditions stipulated in Article 53 of the model charter of advanced agricultural production cooperatives: "no means of support," "lack of labor or complete loss of labor," and "elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled." The cooperative members with difficulties in life are ranked into three categories: the first category, those who have completely lost their ability to work, are fully guaranteed by the cooperative; the second category, those who lack major labor but have slight labor ability, and can obtain part of their income from labor through appropriate production arrangements, the insufficient part of their lives is subsidized by the cooperative; the third category, those whose living problems can be solved through appropriate production arrangements, are temporarily not guaranteed. After the "Five Guarantees" objects are determined, the living standards of the "Five Guarantees" households are determined according to the economic situation of the cooperative and the living standards of the cooperative members. Generally, the living standards of the "Five Guarantees" households are made close to the living standards of the general cooperative members. The subsidy methods include the "three determinations" method of determining living needs, determining labor income, and determining the amount of subsidy (the amount of subsidy is determined based on living needs minus labor income), and subsidizing labor days; some supply physical objects according to the fixed quantity of grain, oil, and cloth supply standards, and issue some holiday expenses and pocket money, such as the Liaoyuan Cooperative in Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, which stipulates that each person receives 560 jin of grain, 28 chi of cloth, 2 carts of firewood, and 15 yuan of holiday expenses per household; some pay cash monthly by the cooperative according to the determined living standard.

Many elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled cooperative members in agricultural production cooperatives, after receiving the "Five Guarantees" treatment, no longer worry about their own issues of life, sustenance, death, and burial. They also said: "Father and mother are not as good as the cooperative." From then on, they strengthened their confidence in taking the cooperative as their home and actively participated in various productions that they could handle. (Luo Tingfen)

    各地农业社积极推行“五保”制度
    许多老弱孤寡残疾的社员不再为生养死葬问题担心
    本报讯　全国各省、区和直辖市的绝大部分高级农业生产合作社，一年来，先后对于社里缺乏劳动力或完全丧失劳动力、生活没有依靠的老、弱、孤、寡、残疾的社员，实行了保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬的“五保”制度。山东省早在去年麦收前即有30％的乡实行了“五保”，40％的乡结合夏收预分进行了“五保户”评定工作，其余30％的乡虽没有评定或评定工作不够完善，但是应该享受“五保”的社员同样得到预分粮，保障了他们的生活，并且在秋收前后进行或整顿了“五保”工作。山东省还有部分初级农业生产合作社也推行了“五保”工作。广东省去年在高级农业生产合作社内享受“五保”待遇的社员，共有八万多户，约占全省应享受“五保”户数的40％（初级社还没有实行“五保”）。辽宁省凤城、桓仁、宽甸、新宾、兴城、开原、建平、营口、阜新、昌图等十个县，大部分农业社的“五保”工作已评定到户。
    在合作化运动发展比较迟缓的省、区，也积极推行了“五保”制度。如贵州省的开阳县花力区，在秋收分配中，对一百一十二户“五保户”共补助了粮食四万一千多斤，现金一千多元和一部分布匹，使“五保户”的吃穿得到了保障；新疆维吾尔自治区的岳普湖县五十二个社的六百多户“五保户”，都比1955年的收入增加。
    各地在确定“五保”对象时，大多是根据高级农业生产合作社示范章程第五十三条规定的“生活没有依靠”“缺乏劳动力或者完全丧失劳动力”“老弱孤寡残疾”等三个条件，把社里生活困难的社员进行排队，分为三类：第一类，完全丧失劳动力的，由社全保；第二类，缺乏主要劳动力而有轻微劳动力，经过适当安排生产能从劳动中取得部分收入的，其生活不足部分由社补助；第三类，通过适当安排生产，生活问题能够解决的，暂时不保。“五保”对象确定以后，再根据社的经济情况和社员的生活水平来确定“五保户”生活标准。一般做到了使“五保户”的生活水平能接近于一般社员生活水平。补助办法，有的采用定生活需要，定劳动收入，定补助数额（根据生活需要除去劳动收入决定补助数额）的“三定”办法，补助劳动日；有的根据粮食三定数量和油、布供应标准供给实物，另发一部分过节费和零用钱，如黑龙江省呼兰县燎原社，规定每人按粮食五百六十斤，布二十八尺，烧柴二车，每户过节费十五元；有的根据已确定的生活标准按月由社支付现金。
    许多农业生产合作社里的老、弱、孤、寡、残疾的社员，在得到“五保”待遇以后，不再为自己的生养死葬问题耽心了。他们还说：“爹亲娘亲，不如社亲。”从此坚定了以社为家的信心，积极地参加了力能胜任的各种生产。　（罗廷芬）
