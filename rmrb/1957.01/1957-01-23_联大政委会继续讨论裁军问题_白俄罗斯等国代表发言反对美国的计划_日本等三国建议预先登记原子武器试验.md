Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 22nd: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on the 21st to continue discussing the issue of disarmament.

    The representatives of Canada, Japan, and Norway jointly submitted a proposal advocating the establishment of a system for the advance registration of atomic weapons tests through the United Nations.

    Norwegian representative Mr. Braenne explained the proposal by saying that Norway is particularly concerned about the “increase in nuclear radiation levels manifested in Norway and elsewhere in the world.”

    Belarusian Foreign Minister Kiselev supported the Soviet disarmament proposals. He disagreed with the U.S. disarmament plan, pointing out that its purpose was to divert attention from the major issues of disarmament. Referring to the proposal by Canada, Norway, and Japan, Kiselev pointed out that it was insufficient because it did not require countries producing atomic weapons to cease nuclear explosion tests, nor did it express the anxiety felt by people around the world regarding the continued carrying out of such tests.

    Czechoslovak representative Ulich also disagreed with the U.S. plan, pointing out that it did not include a proposal to ban nuclear weapon tests. Ulich called for immediate limited disarmament steps to be taken where agreement was possible. He also supported the Soviet representative's proposal to increase the number of members on the Disarmament Commission and the Disarmament Subcommittee "to give Asia and other regions more of a voice."

    Polish representative Winiewicz advocated the establishment of a European collective security system as a way to further implement world disarmament. He supported the idea of establishing a region in Europe, including the whole of Germany, with limitations on armaments. He said that the Soviet and American proposals on inspection could be adopted in that region, followed by the abolition of “foreign military bases and the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops.”

    Representatives from Denmark, Italy, Austria, and France also spoke at the meeting.

    The committee's next meeting will be held on the 22nd.

    联大政委会继续讨论裁军问题
    白俄罗斯等国代表发言反对美国的计划
    日本等三国建议预先登记原子武器试验
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会21日举行会议，继续讨论裁军问题。
    加拿大、日本和挪威三国代表提出一项联合提案，主张通过联合国建立原子武器试验预先登记的制度。
    挪威代表布莱恩在解释这个提案的时候说，挪威特别关心“在挪威和世界别的地方表现出来的核子放射量的增加”。
    白俄罗斯外交部长基谢廖夫支持苏联的裁军建议。他不同意美国的裁军计划，指出这个计划的目的是转移人们对裁军的重大问题的注意。谈到加拿大、挪威和日本三国提案的时候，基谢廖夫指出，这个提案是不够的，因为这个提案并没有要求生产原子武器的国家停止进行核子爆炸试验，同时也没有表达世界各国人民对继续进行这种试验所感到的不安。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表乌里赫也不同意美国的计划，指出这个计划并没有包括禁止核子武器试验的建议在内。乌里赫要求在可能达成协议的地方立即采取有限的裁军步骤。他并且支持苏联代表关于增加裁军委员会和裁军小组委员会的委员人数的建议，“以给亚洲和其他地区更多的发言权”。
    波兰代表维尼维奇主张建立欧洲集体安全体系，作为进一步实行世界裁军的途径。他赞成在欧洲建立一个包括整个德国在内的限制武装的地区的主张。他说，可以在那个地区采用苏联和美国的关于视察的建议，然后废除“外国军事基地和逐步撤退外国部队”。
    在会上发言的还有丹麦、意大利、奥地利和法国等国的代表。
    委员会下次会议在22日举行。
