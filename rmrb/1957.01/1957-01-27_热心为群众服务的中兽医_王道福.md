Enthusiastic Traditional Chinese Veterinary Doctor Serving the People - Wang Daofu
Huangfu Yin

Wang Daofu's family has been practicing veterinary medicine for three generations. His grandfather and uncle served as horse doctors and chief horse doctors in the Wuying (military camp) of Zhenjiang during the Qing Dynasty. They were skilled at treating mules and horses. Later, because the Qing Dynasty was corrupt, they returned to their hometown in Liheng Township, Machang District, Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, to farm and practice veterinary medicine part-time. Wang Daofu had only three acres of thin land when he was young, and the income was not enough to support his entire family. He studied in an old-fashioned private school for five years, and at the age of sixteen, he began to learn veterinary medicine from his uncle, Wang Shiying, and studied books on veterinary medicine and medicinal herbs. From the age of eighteen, he helped his uncle castrate pigs and sheep and diagnose diseases in cattle and horses. When his uncle became ill and lost his ability to work at the age of twenty-one, he began to practice medicine independently. At that time, he was responsible for the epidemic prevention and control of more than 1,500 livestock in four or five townships. He protected livestock for the masses with his ancestral skills. After years of research and exploration, he not only could treat common livestock diseases, but also treat bovine "whirling sickness," remove "cloudy eye worms," and treat bovine bloat with goose feather tubes. The efficacy was generally over 90%, and his superb skills enjoyed a great reputation among the masses. At that time, the landlord class regarded veterinarians as lowly people who were always "behind donkeys and horses." Once, Wang Daofu went to the house of landlord Xu Xinwu to help him castrate a pig. After the castration, Xu Xinwu not only did not entertain him, but also made him eat leftovers in the servants' quarters. He ran home in a rage, leading his donkey. From these things, he realized that relying solely on skill was not enough to improve his situation. Since 1944, he had participated in local work with the poor people in the village, and in April 1946, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Since then, he served as a branch secretary and deputy township head in the township while continuing to prevent and treat livestock diseases for the masses, and used this to connect with the masses.

In 1949, Shuyang County was liberated again. In less than two years, veterinary associations and joint veterinary clinics were generally established in various districts. To enable veterinarians to play a greater role, the first thing to do was to make secret prescriptions public. However, at that time, many veterinarians were unwilling to make them public due to the influence of tradition, and some were afraid that the joint clinics would not last long and that their skills would be learned by others, and that their jobs would be taken away in the future. Under the education of the Party, Wang Daofu knew that the veterinary organizations would not disband, so he mobilized everyone to make the secret prescriptions public. In order to dispel others' concerns, he took the lead in making public more than ten ancestral secret prescriptions and techniques for treating "whirling sickness" in plough cattle, removing "cloudy eye worms" from mules and horses, and treating bovine bloat. Under his leading influence, every veterinarian contributed several secret prescriptions for treating cattle, mules, and horse diseases. After removing duplicates, the fifteen veterinarians in the district compiled more than sixty secret prescriptions in total. After the secret prescriptions were compiled, Wang Daofu immediately organized everyone to conduct technical exchanges. After learning and teaching, those who were not skilled in some techniques in the past felt confident, and most of those who did not know them in the past have now learned them. Many people used to have inaccurate acupuncture points and poor efficacy. After adjusting the points through technical exchanges, the efficacy increased.

After the secret prescriptions were made public, veterinary techniques were generally improved. Ordinary veterinarians can treat more than one hundred diseases, and Wang Daofu is familiar with even more. At that time, some technical cadres of animal husbandry and veterinary stations looked down on traditional Chinese veterinarians, thinking that their "ancient cattle and horse classics" were unscientific, which caused ideological confusion among some veterinarians. Especially after the county held a training class for animal husbandry technicians of agricultural cooperatives, many technicians, like veterinarians, learned the technology of injecting livestock for treatment. Some old veterinarians were afraid that agricultural cooperatives would have animal husbandry technicians in the future, and veterinarians would not be able to make a living. At this time, Wang Daofu repeatedly explained the principles to everyone. On the one hand, he explained the benefits of Western veterinary medicine and the role of animal husbandry technicians in agricultural cooperatives, pointing out that traditional Chinese veterinary medicine did have some unscientific aspects, such as not disinfecting during castration and not knowing how to measure body temperature, etc. On the other hand, he also explained that traditional Chinese veterinary medicine is a valuable heritage of the motherland for thousands of years. Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine should not only learn the scientific technology of Western veterinary medicine, but also not underestimate its own heritage. Mutual learning is necessary to adapt to the growing needs of animal husbandry. After his repeated propaganda and mobilization, the thinking of the general traditional Chinese veterinarians was stabilized. They not only sorted out many effective secret prescriptions, but also generally learned new technologies such as epidemic prevention injection and disinfection. Even the old veterinarian Wang Qingyin, who was originally afraid of losing his job, smiled and took the initiative to contact the animal husbandry technicians of the agricultural cooperative to help them do a good job in the feeding and epidemic prevention of draught animals.

Wang Daofu has a deep love for livestock and a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to veterinary work. Some veterinarians often like to tie up livestock when treating them, which not only causes pain to the livestock, but also makes the nerves too tense, which is not good for acupuncture, and sometimes accidents such as broken legs occur. Wang Daofu is very familiar with the temperament of cattle and horses. When irrigating medicine or performing surgery, he always tries to follow the temperament of the cattle and horses. He knows that the belly of cattle and horses cannot be licked or scratched frequently. When treating diseases, he slightly helps them to scratch the itch, and the livestock can be tamed and quiet. He only uses binding when it is necessary, so the efficacy is generally better. In the summer of 1955, the weather was hot, and a cow in Wu Xian's house in Tangjian Township had a difficult birth. At that time, three traditional Chinese veterinarians "delivered" it overnight, but the calf did not come down, and it looked like the cow was about to die. Wang Daofu learned about this and rushed from more than ten miles away early the next morning. He didn't bother to rest, asked about the condition, and immediately performed surgery, took out the stillbirth, and saved the animal. Afterwards, he found the original three veterinarians to exchange techniques for "delivering difficult births," so that everyone mastered this technique.

Wang Daofu is not only enthusiastic about serving the masses, but also takes time to sort out ancestral and folk secret prescriptions and learn the techniques and experience of Chinese and Western veterinary medicine in the gaps of his tense work. In addition, he and other veterinarians also work hard to train young veterinarians. In the past two years, he has trained Ma Jianhua, a graduate of senior primary school, to become a primary veterinarian who can castrate, inject, and treat common diseases. Recently, he has taken in another apprentice. He is also preparing to train his fifteen-year-old son to become a veterinarian. Because he also has certain abilities and experience in social work, some people have mobilized him to change his career to become a cadre, but he always smiled and said, "I can't give up the craft I've learned for twenty years." Especially after he participated in the National Folk Veterinarian Symposium last year, he learned that the Party and the government are actively strengthening the leadership of animal husbandry and veterinary work, and his confidence in dedicating his life to animal husbandry and veterinary work has become even more firm. When I left the Machang District Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Joint Clinic, he took my hand enthusiastically and said to me: "The socialist cause of the motherland is developing and growing stronger day by day, and the future of animal husbandry and veterinary work is also infinitely bright. Our folk veterinarians must unite with Western veterinarians, learn from each other, further improve our political and professional level, and better serve the masses."

    热心为群众服务的中兽医——王道福
    皇甫垠
    王道福家里祖孙相传学兽医已经三代了，祖父和叔父清朝曾先后在镇江的武营里当过马医生和马医长，有一手治骡、马的好本领，后来因为清朝腐败，就回到江苏省沭阳县马厂区李恒乡原籍务农，兼行兽医。王道福幼年时候，家中只有三亩薄地，收入不够维持全家生活，他在改良私塾读了五年书，十六岁就开始从叔父王世英学兽医，并且研读有关兽医和药草的著作；十八岁起帮助叔父阉割猪羊和诊断牛马疾病；二十一岁时叔父患病丧失了劳力，他就开始独立行医了。当时，他一个人担负着四、五个乡一千五百多头牲畜的疫病防治工作，凭着祖传的手艺为群众保护牲畜。经过多年的钻研和摸索，他不仅能治一般的牲畜病症，还会治牛的“旋转疯”、取“浑睛虫”以及用鹅毛管治牛臌胀病等，疗效一般在90％以上，他高超的手艺在群众中享有盛名。当时，地主阶级把兽医看成是“驴前马后”的下贱人物。有一次，王道福兴冲冲地到地主徐心武家去帮他阉猪，阉罢猪，徐心武不但不招待他，还让他到下房里吃残羹冷饭，他一气就牵着驴子跑回家去了。从这些事情中他认识到：要翻身单靠手艺还不行；打1944年起，他就和村上的穷哥儿们一起参加了地方工作，1946年4月光荣地参加了中国共产党。此后，他一面在乡内担任支部书记和副乡长等职务；一面继续为群众防治牲畜疾病，并以此联系群众。
    1949年沭阳县再度解放了。没两年，各区就普遍成立起兽医协会和兽医联合诊疗所的组织。要使兽医发挥更大的作用，头一件事是要公开秘方。可是当时很多兽医因传统的影响不愿意公开，也有的怕联合诊所不得长，技术被人学去，将来饭碗就被人夺了。王道福在党的教育下知道兽医组织起来不会散，便动员大家把秘方公开出来。为了打消别人的顾虑，他带头把治耕牛“旋转疯”、取骡马“浑睛虫”，以及治牛臌胀病等十多种祖传的秘方和技术公开出来。在他的带头影响下，每一个兽医都献出了几种治牛、骡、马疫病的秘方，除去重复的，全区十五个兽医共整理出六十多种秘方。秘方整理出来以后，王道福马上组织大家进行技术交流，经过学习传授，过去有些技术不熟练的感到有把握了，过去不会的，现在大部分都学会了。不少人过去针灸部位不准，疗效不好，经过技术交流调正部位以后，疗效增加了。
    秘方公开后，兽医技术普遍得到提高。一般兽医都能治一百多种疾病，王道福熟悉的更多一些。当时有些畜牧兽医站的技术干部却瞧不起中兽医，认为他们的“古牛马经”不科学，曾引起部分兽医思想上的混乱。特别是在县里举办了农业社畜牧技术员训练班之后，很多技术员和兽医一样，学会了给牲畜打针治病的技术，有的老兽医就害怕将来农业社都有畜牧技术员，兽医要吃不上饭了。王道福这时就向大家反复把道理说清楚。他一面说明西兽医的好处和农业社畜牧技术员的作用，指出中兽医确有一些不科学的地方，如阉割不消毒、不会量体温等等；一方面也说明中兽医是祖国几千年的宝贵遗产。中兽医既要学习西兽医的科学技术，也不能轻视自己的遗产，要相互学习，才能适应畜牧业的日益发展的需要。经过他这样反复的宣传动员以后，一般中兽医的思想都稳定了，不仅整理了很多有成效的秘方，还普遍学习了防疫注射、消毒等新技术。连原来怕失业的老年兽医王庆银也喜笑颜开地主动和农业社畜牧技术员联系，帮助他们搞好耕畜饲养和疫病防治了。
    王道福对牲畜有很深的热爱，对兽医工作怀有强烈的责任感和事业心。有些兽医替牲畜治病常爱捆绑，牲畜既受痛苦，而且神经过分紧张也不好用针，有时还会发生跌坏了腿等事故；王道福却很熟悉牛马的性格，在灌药或动手术的时候，总是尽量顺着牛、马性格，他知道牛、马的肚子下面经常舐不到、抓不到，治病时用手稍为帮它抓一抓痒，牲畜就能驯顺地安静下来，只在不得已的时候才用捆绑，这样疗效一般都比较好。1955年的夏天，天正炎热，汤涧乡吴先家中一头母牛难产，当时三位中兽医“领产”一夜，犊也未下来，眼看母牛就要死去；这事被王道福晓得了，第二天一早就从十几里路以外赶来，他顾不得休息，问清病情，立即动手术，把死胎接下来，保全了母畜。事后，他又找原来的三位兽医一起交流“领难产”的技术，使大家都掌握了这一技术。
    王道福不仅热心为群众服务，他在紧张的工作空隙，还抽时间整理祖传的和民间的秘方，学习中西兽医的技术和经验。另外，他和其他兽医一起，还努力培养青年兽医。两年来，他已经把高小毕业生马健华培养成为一个会阉割、会注射、会治一般疾病的初级兽医了；最近又吸收了一个学徒。他还准备把自己十五岁的儿子也培养成兽医。因为他从事社会工作也有一定的能力和经验，有人曾动员他改行去当干部，但他总笑笑说：“学了二十年的手艺，不能丢。”特别是去年他参加了全国民间兽医座谈会以后，他知道了党和政府正在积极加强对畜牧兽医工作的领导，他终生献身畜牧兽医工作的信心更坚定了。在我离开马厂区畜牧兽医联合诊所的时候，他拉着我的手热情地对我说：“祖国的社会主义事业正一天天地发展壮大，畜牧兽医工作的前途也无限光明，我们民间兽医一定要和西兽医团结一致，相互学习，进一步提高政治、业务水平，更好地为群众服务。”
