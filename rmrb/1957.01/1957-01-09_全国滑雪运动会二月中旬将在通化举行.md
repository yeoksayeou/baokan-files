    全国滑雪运动会二月中旬将在通化举行
    新华社长春7日电　体育运动委员会决定2月中旬在吉林省长白山区的通化市举行1957年全国滑雪运动会。
    辽宁、黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区的十多个市的滑雪代表队，将参加这个中国第一次举行的全国性的滑雪比赛。这次的比赛项目有男子和女子的速度滑雪、回旋障碍滑雪和快速降下滑雪等。
    运动会将在通化市东南郊的浑江畔举行。那里的群山复盖着一片一尺多厚的白雪，一个长一百五十公尺宽约二百公尺的山坡，将成为主要的竞赛场所。参加速度滑雪中长距离滑雪比赛的男运动员，将要越过十几个山头到达一座最高的山峰，然后沿着环山公路返回出发点，全程约二十公里。这是这次比赛中距离最长的一个项目。
    目前，运动会的各项准备工作正在进行中。
