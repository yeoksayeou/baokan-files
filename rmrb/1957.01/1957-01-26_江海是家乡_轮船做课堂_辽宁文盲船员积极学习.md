　　Rivers and Seas are Home, Ships are Classrooms
　　Liaoning's Illiterate Sailors Actively Study

　　(Our dispatch) All three hundred and nine illiterate sailors on inland river and coastal tugboats, barges, passenger and cargo ships, and passenger ships in Liaoning Province have participated in cultural studies. Because the ships are scattered, highly mobile, and have tight shipping schedules, they put forward the slogan "Rivers and seas are home, ships are classrooms." Taking the ship as a unit, they implemented methods of "the advanced leading the less advanced," "guaranteed teaching and learning," and the "little teacher" system. They studied intensively when not busy, studied less when a little busy, and did not study when very busy, seizing the gaps in production and docking time to learn. Over the past year, more than one hundred and sixty of them have learned eight hundred to one thousand characters, and the rest can recognize five hundred to seven hundred characters. Many people can keep navigation logs and write letters home.

    江海是家乡　轮船做课堂
    辽宁文盲船员积极学习
    本报讯　辽宁省内河和沿海的拖轮、驳船、客货轮和客船上的三百零九名文盲船员，都参加了文化学习。由于船只分散、流动性大、航运任务又紧张，他们提出了“江海是家乡、轮船做课堂”的口号，以船为单位，实行以高带低、包教保学和小先生制的办法，大忙不学、小忙少学、不忙紧学，抓紧了生产空隙和停泊时间进行学习。一年多来，他们之中有一百六十多人已认识八百到一千字，其余的人也都能认识五百到七百字了。许多人会记航行日志和写家信了。
