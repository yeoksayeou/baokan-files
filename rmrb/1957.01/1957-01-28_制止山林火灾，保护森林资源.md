    Stop Forest Fires, Protect Forest Resources
    (I)
    Since the beginning of winter, forest fires have been widespread in various parts of the Rong County Special District, Guangxi Province. According to incomplete statistics from nine counties including Cenxi, Guiben, and Luchuan, a total of 314 forest fires of varying sizes have occurred since September of last year, burning over 90,000 mu of forest area and destroying over 720,000 trees of various sizes. The most serious case was in Cenxi County, where 118 forest fires occurred from September 1st to October 23rd, burning over 12,000 mu of forest area and destroying over 440,000 trees. In Tongtou Township, Xinxu District, the county had a forest fire on November 14 that burned over 25 hilltops.
    Forest fires are mainly caused by some farmers burning ash on the mountains to accumulate fertilizer. For example, among the 118 forest fires in Cenxi County, 98 were caused by burning ash to accumulate fertilizer. Therefore, I suggest resolutely prohibiting farmers from burning ash on the mountains to accumulate fertilizer. Farmers should be educated to use grass composting or making compost instead of burning ash to accumulate fertilizer, and widely publicize the policy of protecting forests and preventing fires.　Qin Sihong

    Since last autumn, forest fires have been occurring constantly in the Shaoguan Special District, Guangdong Province. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Conghua, Qingyuan, and Renhua, a total of more than 110 forest fires have occurred, affecting an area of more than 219,000 mu and destroying more than 2 million trees of various sizes. In Conghua County alone, ten forest fires occurred in October, burning over 420,000 mu and destroying more than 200,000 pine, fir, and miscellaneous trees of various sizes.
    Why did such serious forest fires occur? The main reason is that forest fire prevention publicity has not been widely carried out in various places, and many places have not resolutely prohibited farmers from burning ash on the mountains to accumulate fertilizer. Many forest fires are caused by burning ash to accumulate fertilizer. It is hoped that the relevant leaders in Guangdong Province will pay attention to this issue and take measures to strengthen fire prevention and forest protection work.

    Since the beginning of last winter, forest fires in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, have been very serious, causing great losses to the country. As of December 14th last year, forest fires had occurred in 36 of the county's 46 townships, totaling 46 fires, burning an area of more than 86,000 mu and destroying more than 1,235,000 trees and bamboos of various sizes. Thirty-seven people were injured in extinguishing the forest fires. Compared with the same period in 1955, the number of forest fires has doubled, and the area burned and the loss of forest have increased by more than two times. Among them, the forest fire in Zijing Mountain caused the greatest loss, burning for three days and four nights, and the area of forest burned was more than 40,000 mu.
    The causes of forest fires, in addition to arson and sabotage by class enemies and bad elements, many are caused by burning field ridges for land reclamation, warming fires and smoking, burning paper on graves, and children playing with fire. If the local Party committees and people's committees at all levels pay attention to forest fire prevention work and pay attention to controlling fire sources, such man-made forest fires can be completely avoided.　Wu Zhenda

### 制止山林火灾，保护森林资源

    制止山林火灾，保护森林资源
    （一）
    入冬以来广西省容县专区各地普遍发生山林火灾。据岑溪、桂本、陆川等九个县的不完全统计，自去年9月份以来共发生大小山火三百一十四次，烧去森林面积九万多亩，烧毁各种大小林木七十二万余株。其中最严重的是岑溪县，自9月1日到10月23日，共发生山火一百一十八次，烧去森林面积一万二千余亩，烧毁林木四十四万余株。该县的新圩区桐头乡11月14日发生的一次山火就烧遍二十五个山头。
    山林火灾主要是由于有些农民上山烧灰积肥引起的。如岑溪县发生的一百一十八次山火中，因烧灰积肥所引起的就有九十八次。因此，我建议坚决禁止农民上山烧灰积肥。应该教育农民以割草沤肥或制堆肥来代替烧灰积肥，并广泛宣传护林防山的政策。　覃嗣宏

    广东省韶关专区自去年秋季以来，山林火灾不断发生。据从化、清远、仁化等七个县的不完全统计，共发生山林火灾一百一十多次，受害面积二十一万九千多亩，烧毁大小林木二百多万株。从化县仅10月份就发生十次山火，烧毁面积四十二万多亩，损失大小松、杉杂树二十多万株。
    为什么会发生这样严重的山火呢？主要原因是各地没有广泛地开展护林防火宣传，许多地方没有坚决禁止农民上山烧灰积肥。许多山火是烧灰积肥所引起的。希望广东省有关领导方面重视这个问题，采取措施，加强防火护林工作。

    从去年入冬以来，湖北省阳新县的山林火灾十分严重，给国家造成了很大损失。截至去年12月14日为止，全县四十六个乡，就有三十六个乡发生了山林火灾，共计四十六次，延烧面积达八万六千多亩，烧毁大小树木、竹子一百二十三万五千多株。因为扑灭山火，受伤的有三十七人。同1955年同期比较，山林火灾次数增加了一倍，延烧面积和林木损失增加了两倍多。其中以紫金山发生的一次山林火灾所受损失最大，烧了三天四夜，被烧掉的山林面积就有四万多亩。
    酿成山林火灾的原因，除了阶级敌人和坏分子放火破坏外，有不少是由于开荒烧田塍、烤火吸烟、上坟烧纸、小孩玩火所引起的。如果当地各级党委和人民委员会重视护林防火工作，注意控制火源，这种人为的山林火灾，是完全可以避免的。　武振达
