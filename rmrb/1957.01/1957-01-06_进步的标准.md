    The Standard of Progress

    Vice-Director Wang was chatting with his old comrade-in-arms, Section Chief Qian, in his office after ten years of separation. They talked about the "backwardness" and "progress" of their old friends:

    Section Chief Qian sighed, "The changes in the last ten years have been really big! Some people progress quickly, and some progress slowly. Compared to them, I'm probably the most backward! Just take you and me, for example. You're already a division-level cadre, but I'm still just a small section chief!"

      "Oh, come on! I'm nothing!" Vice-Director Wang said pleasantly and humbly, "Compared to others, I'm also backward. Do you remember Old Tan, who used to work with us? He's made progress so fast! Now he's already a bureau director!"

    "Heh heh! It's hard to say." Section Chief Qian's tone of sighing remained unchanged, "Even Little Zhu, who used to be under my leadership, is now my superior. Hmm, if I had been transferred away from that place earlier..."

      "Ah—choo!" Little Tao, who was sorting out report materials for Vice-Director Wang, sneezed, interrupting the intimate conversation between the two old friends. Only then did Vice-Director Wang and Section Chief Qian remember that there was someone else in the room, and they felt that some of the things they had said were a bit of a "slip of the tongue."

    进步的标准
    王副处长在办公室里同十年不见的老战友钱科长畅叙阔别。他们谈到了旧日朋友们的“落后”和“进步”：
    钱科长感叹地，“十年来的变化真大啊！有的人进步就快，有的人进步就慢。比起来，恐怕就要数我落后了！就拿你和我来说吧，你已经是处级干部了，而我呢，如今还是一个小科头！”
      “那里，那里！我算得什么！”王副处长愉快而谦逊地，“比起来，我也落后了。你知道过去同我们在一起工作的那个老谭吗？人家进步的才快哩！现在他已经是局长了！”
    “嘿嘿！真是难说。”钱科长的感叹的声调未变，“就连以前在我领导下的那个小朱，现在也变成我的上级了。嗯，要是把我早些调开那个地方，……”
      “阿——嚏！”正在一旁为王副处长整理报告材料的小陶打了个喷嚏，打断了这两位老友的知心话。这时王副处长、钱科长才想起还有另外一个人在屋里，于是觉得刚才的一些话有点“失言”。
