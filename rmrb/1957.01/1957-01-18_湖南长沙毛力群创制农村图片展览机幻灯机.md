    Mao Liqun of Changsha, Hunan, Creates Rural Picture Exhibition Machine and Slide Projector

    (Our newspaper reports) Mao Liqun of Changsha City, Hunan Province, after a long period of research, created two kinds of cultural propaganda tools: a rural picture exhibition machine and a slide projector. Their main features are: economical and practical, simple to operate, easy to carry, and easy to imitate, suitable for conducting vivid propaganda and education deep among the masses. Some cultural centers have tried them out and the results have been good and very popular with the masses. Some call the rural picture exhibition machine a "field-side picture exhibition," and others call it a "door-to-door picture exhibition." In order to encourage the creation of cultural propaganda tools, the Ministry of Culture has awarded Mao Liqun a bonus of 200 yuan and asked him to conduct further research and improvements.

    湖南长沙毛力群创制农村图片展览机幻灯机
    本报讯　湖南长沙市毛力群经过长期钻研，创制了两种文化宣传工具——农村图片展览机和幻灯机。它们的主要特点是：经济实用、操作简易、携带轻便、仿造容易，适于深入广大群众进行形象化的宣传教育。有的文化馆曾经试用，效果良好，很受群众欢迎。有的称农村图片展览机为“田边图片展览会”，有的称它为“送上门的图片展览会”。文化部为了鼓励对文化宣传工具的创造，已发给毛力群奖金二百元，并要求他作进一步的研究改进。　（之林）
