Xinhua News Agency, January 21st – The State Economic Commission has preliminarily investigated and studied the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in industry, proving that various industries have enormous potential for increasing production, saving raw materials, improving quality, and reducing accidents.

    In the coal industry, if all miners pay attention to quality and reduce the ash content (sand, gravel, etc.) in the nation's coal by 1% to 2% this year, it would be equivalent to increasing production by 2.4 million to 4.8 million tons of coal. A reduction of 1% to 2% in ash content would reduce railway transport by 800 million to 1.6 billion ton-kilometers, saving 8 million to 16 million yuan in transportation costs. Based on recent coal production conditions, reducing ash content by 1% to 2% is possible.

    One of the main difficulties in increasing coal production this year is the shortage of pit props, but according to comparisons of pit prop consumption between enterprises, there is still considerable potential for saving pit props.

    Saving iron ore and coke is key to increasing steel production this year. According to investigations, slag from the production of sulfuric acid byproducts contains about 50% iron. This year, China's chemical plants or some paper mills will produce 500,000 to 600,000 tons of this slag. If technical personnel solve the technical problem of using this slag for iron smelting, the annual increase in iron production could be more than 200,000 to 300,000 tons. In the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, there are already successful experiences in utilizing this slag that can be used as a reference. In terms of saving coke, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has, through experimentation, been able to replace 100,000 tons of coke not used for ironmaking with substitutes this year. Domestic experiments and foreign technical data indicate that if the supply of anthracite coal as a substitute is guaranteed, it is highly possible to replace another 100,000 tons of coke with substitutes.

    This year, steel used by the machinery industry accounts for approximately 61% of the total steel used in national industrial production. Therefore, saving steel in the machinery industry and providing the necessary raw materials for the industry to increase production is of great significance.

    Comparisons of steel casting scrap rates between enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building show how much potential there is for saving. The scrap rates for castings at the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant and the Jinan Diesel Engine Plant are just over 2%, while the scrap rates for castings at the Qiqihar Machine Tool Manufacturing Plant and the Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant are as high as 16% or more. In this regard, the scrap rates of local enterprises are, on average, higher than those of central enterprises when compared to central enterprises.

    Improving technology and design, and reducing raw material consumption quotas or the weight of products, can also save steel while ensuring quality. For example, the Shanghai Bicycle Factory uses 21 kilograms of steel per bicycle, while Shenyang uses 24 to 25 kilograms. If factories that use more materials improve their technological processes and reduce the steel used per bicycle to 21 kilograms, a large amount of steel can be saved.

    In terms of design, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant thinned the guards, which accounted for more than half the total weight of one type of machine tool, saving 356 kilograms of steel per machine. There are many similar situations in the machinery industry, and the potential is great.

    Striving to increase power generation and conserve electricity has become a question of whether industry in many areas can increase production, as more than 20 regions are currently experiencing power shortages. Although China's power generation equipment is already operating at a high load, many facilities have still not reached their "nameplate output" (the designed capacity of the generator). Therefore, there is still potential to increase power generation. In terms of electricity consumption, according to investigations, many enterprises use vastly different amounts of electricity to produce the same products. Chongqing's electric furnaces use more than 400 kilowatt-hours to smelt one ton of steel, while Kunming's electric furnaces use 1,100 kilowatt-hours. The Tianjin Paper Mill uses about 400 kilowatt-hours to produce one ton of glazed paper, while the Shenyang Paper Mill uses about 1,100 kilowatt-hours. In terms of civil electricity consumption, especially in government agencies and shops, there is also waste.

    In 1956, a lot of electricity was lost on transmission lines across the country. If various measures are taken to reduce the power loss on transmission lines by another 0.5% compared to this year's planned targets, nearly 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved throughout the year.

    Like other industries, there is also considerable potential for increasing production and practicing economy in building materials and chemical industries. Simply doing a good job in safety production and reducing accidents can increase production or save a lot of wealth. Cement plants under the Building Materials Industry Department had a total of 1,350 "ring formation" accidents from January to October last year, an increase of 68% compared to the same period of the previous year. These accidents resulted in a total of 1,118 hours of downtime, reducing cement production by more than 58,000 tons. If the number of "ring formation" accidents in each cement plant this year is reduced to the number in 1955, the country can increase cement production by at least 50,000 to 60,000 tons. The chemical industry also has similar phenomena of waste or reduced production due to frequent accidents. Therefore, simply strengthening safety production can tap into a lot of potential for increasing production or practicing economy.

    In light industry, improving product quality has a particularly significant effect on increasing production and practicing economy. For example, the average lifespan of light bulbs produced in Shanghai last year was extended by 300 to 400 hours, which is equivalent to an increase in production of 3 million to 4 million light bulbs. The Shanghai-produced rubber shoes are expected to have their durability increased by 20% on the existing level, which is equivalent to producing 12 million more pairs of rubber shoes a year. If the mileage of tires is increased by another 5,000 kilometers, it will be equivalent to producing 40,000 more sets of tires. If factories across the country that produce light bulbs, rubber shoes, tires, and other products all strive to improve the quality of their products, the relatively increased output and the benefits it brings to the people are imaginable.

    In addition to continuing to reduce raw material consumption quotas, developing new raw material resources is an important way to increase production in light industry. For hemp alone, there are more than 40 kinds of substitutes that can be researched and utilized, of which cotton stalks alone produce about 9.2 million dan (a unit of weight) nationwide each year. According to preliminary tests, cotton stalk fibers can be used to weave linen cloth, sacks, make paper, and wrap cables. Only half of the approximately 5,000 tons of cashmere produced in China each year is utilized. It is estimated that the country produces about 15,000 tons of miscellaneous hair from cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, etc. each year, but the purchasing departments only purchase more than 200 tons, accounting for a little over 1% of the total. These miscellaneous hairs can completely replace wool in making felt.

    国家经济委员会在调查研究中证明
    工业部门增产节约潜力巨大
    新华社21日讯　国家经济委员会初步调查研究了工业中增产节约的潜力，证明各类工业在增加生产，节约原料，提高质量，减少事故等方面，都蕴藏着增产节约的巨大潜力。
    在煤炭工业方面，如果全体矿工们注意质量，使今年全国的煤炭中的灰分（砂石等）减少1％到2％，就等于增产二百四十万到四百八十万吨煤；灰分减少1％到2％，就可以使铁路运输减少八亿到十六亿吨公里的运量，节省八百万到一千六百万元的运费。根据近年来煤炭生产的情况，减少1％到2％的灰分是可能的。
    今年增产煤炭主要困难之一是缺坑木，而根据各企业之间耗坑木情况的比较，节约坑木还有不少潜力。
    节约铁矿石和焦炭，是今年增产钢铁的关键。据调查，制造硫酸副产品的矿渣中含铁量在50％左右，今年我国化工厂或某些造纸厂将出产五十到六十万吨这种矿渣。如果组织技术人员们解决了利用这种矿渣炼铁的技术问题，全年就可以增产二十多万到三十万吨铁。在苏联和捷克斯洛伐克，已有利用这种矿渣的成功的经验可供借镜。在节省焦炭方面，冶金工业部经过试验，今年可以用代用品，代替十万吨非炼铁用的焦炭。国内试验和国外的技术资料表明，如果作为代用品的无烟煤供应有保证，另外再争取以代用品代替十万吨焦炭是有很大可能的。
    今年机械工业用的钢材，大约占全国工业生产用钢的61％，因此，机械工业节约钢材，为机械工业增产提供所需的原料，有重大的意义。
    第一机械工业部各企业之间，钢铸件废品率的比较中可以看出，这方面有着多大的节约“油水”。南京机床厂和济南柴油机厂铸件废品率是2％多一点，而齐齐哈尔机床制造厂和重庆柴油机厂铸件废品率则高达16％以上。这方面，地方同中央的企业相比，地方企业的废品率，平均又高于中央的企业。
    改进工艺和设计，降低原料消耗定额或产品的重量，也可以在保证质量的条件下节约钢材。例如上海自行车厂每辆自行车用钢二十一公斤，沈阳却用二十四到二十五公斤。如果用料多的厂，都改进工艺过程，每台自行车用钢降到二十一公斤，就能节省大量的钢材。
    在设计方面，上海机床厂把占一种机床总重量一半以上的护罩改薄，每台就节省了三百五十六公斤钢铁。在机械工业中，类似的情况很多，潜力很大。
    争取增加发电量和节约用电，已成为关系到很多地方的工业能否增产的问题，因为现在有二十多个地区缺电。我国发电设备虽然负荷已很大，但仍然有不少设备还没有达到“铭牌出力”（发电机的设计能力），因此，增加发电量还是有潜力的。在用电方面，据调查，很多企业，生产同样的产品，用电量却悬殊。重庆的电炉炼一吨钢，用电四百多度，昆明的电炉则用一千一百度，天津造纸厂生产一吨有光纸，用电四百度左右，而沈阳的造纸厂则为一千一百度左右。在民用电方面，特别是机关和商店用电，也还存在着浪费现象。
    1956年全国有很多电力在输电线路上损失了，如果采取各种措施，使今年线路损失的电力比今年的计划指标再降低0.5％，全年就可以节省近一亿度电。
    建筑材料和化学工业的增产节约，同其它工业一样，各方面也都有不少潜力，单是作好安全生产工作，减少事故，就可以增产或节约许多财富。建筑材料工业部所属的水泥厂，去年1月到10月，共发生“结圈”事故一千三百五十次，比前一年同期增加了68％；这十个月因结圈事故共停工一千一百一十八小时，减产五万八千多吨水泥。如果今年各个水泥厂“结圈”事故减到1955年的次数，全国至少可以增产五六万吨水泥。化学工业也同样存在着因事故多而浪费或减产的现象。因此，单是加强安全生产工作，就可以挖掘出不少的增产或节约的潜力。
    在轻工业方面，提高产品质量，对增产节约的效果表现得特别显著。例如，上海去年生产的灯泡，由于平均寿命延长了三百到四百小时，等于增产了三百到四百万支灯泡。上海所产的胶鞋，耐穿的时间，准备在现有的水平上提高20％，这样一年就等于多生产一千二百万双胶鞋；轮胎行驶里程若再提高五千公里，就等于多产四万套轮胎。全国生产灯泡、胶鞋、轮胎及其它产品的工厂，如果都努力把产品的质量提高一步，相对增加的产量和它给人民带来的利益之大，是可以想像的。
    轻工业除可以继续降低原料消耗定额以外，开辟新的原料资源，是增加生产的重要途径。单是麻类，就有四十多种代用品可以研究利用，其中仅是棉杆皮，全国一年就产九百二十万担左右。据初步试验，棉杆皮纤维可以织麻布、麻袋、造纸、包电缆等。我国每年出产的五千吨左右的山羊绒，才只利用了一半。全国一年出产的牛、马、骡、驴等杂毛，估计有一万五千吨，而采购部门仅收购二百多吨，占总数的百分之一多一点。这些杂毛，完全可以代替羊毛制毡。
