Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 28th - The relations between the military and civilians in Tibet are harmonious, and many stories of mutual trust and care between the military and civilians are circulating in the rural areas and pastures of Tibet.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet correctly implements the policy of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief. They would rather sleep in the open than enter civilian houses and temples without permission, and they respect the customs and habits of the Tibetan people in every way. During Tibetan festivals, officers and soldiers join the local Tibetans in celebrations. The People's Liberation Army stationed in various parts of Tibet also often helps Tibetan people with the autumn harvest, plowing, and building houses. Last year, the mechanized farming team of the August 1st Farm used combine harvesters to thresh 40,000 catties of highland barley for the Tibetan farmers in the suburbs of Lhasa, and also used tractors to help the Tibetan people plow the land. They taught farming techniques to Tibetan farmers and helped plant vegetables, becoming close partners of the Tibetan farmers.

When Tibetan people have emergencies or are threatened by some natural disaster, the officers and soldiers often rush to the rescue regardless of their own safety, and are loved by the Tibetan people. Last year, there was also a touching story of a Tibetan named Renqin Dorje sacrificing his life to save the drowning PLA soldier Shi En-yuan.

In the garrison areas, Tibetans often come to visit their friends. When officers and soldiers are on business trips, both familiar and unfamiliar Tibetan families will invite them to stay in their homes, and sometimes the homeowners will hand over the keys to the PLA for safekeeping when they go out.

On construction sites where the troops and Tibetan migrant workers work together, during certain holidays or rest periods, people can also see the PLA officers and soldiers and Tibetan migrant workers gathered together, enthusiastically singing and dancing.

    相互信任　彼此爱护
    西藏军民关系融洽
    新华社拉萨28日电　西藏军民关系融洽，许多军民之间互相信任、彼此爱护的故事流传在西藏的农村和牧场。
    驻西藏的人民解放军正确执行民族政策和宗教信仰自由政策，他们宁肯露宿，也不擅自进驻民房和寺庙，并且处处尊重西藏人民的风俗习惯。每逢藏历节日，官兵们就和当地藏民一起联欢庆贺。驻西藏各地的人民解放军还常常帮助藏民秋收、耕地、修盖房屋。去年，八一农场的机耕队用康拜因收割机给拉萨市郊区的藏族农民脱粒青稞四万斤，还用拖拉机帮助藏民耕地。他们把耕作技术教给藏族农民，并帮助栽种菜蔬，成了藏族农民亲密的伙伴。
    当藏民有了急难或遭受到某种自然灾害威胁的时候，官兵们常常是奋不顾身地去抢救，受到藏民爱戴。去年还出现了藏民任钦多吉为了抢救落水的解放军战士史恩远而牺牲了自己生命的动人事迹。
    在部队的驻地，常有藏民前来探望自己的朋友。官兵们出差时，不管是熟识的或陌生的藏族人家，都会邀请他们到屋里住宿，有时房主人外出，还把锁门的钥匙交给解放军保管。
    在部队和藏族民工一起施工的建筑工地上，遇到某些假日或休息时，人们还会看见这里的解放军官兵和藏族民工聚在一起热情地唱歌跳舞。
