Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech (Abstract)

    The Chinese people wholeheartedly thank Poland for its significant contribution to peace in Asia. The Polish people have contributed to our socialist construction. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Polish people for the peace, happiness, and bright future of mankind. As long as we are good at distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy, and unite closely, any conspiracy of imperialism will surely fail.

    Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at a mass rally in Krakow, Poland, on the 13th.

    Premier Zhou first extended warm brotherly greetings on behalf of the Chinese people to those present, saying: Most of the members of the Chinese government delegation are visiting Krakow for the first time, but we have long admired this ancient cultural city with a long history. Here is the historic Jagiellonian University, which once cultivated the world-renowned great scientist Copernicus. We are very grateful for the arrangements made by the Mayor of Krakow, which gave us the opportunity to meet with representatives from all walks of life and the people of Krakow.

    Premier Zhou then said that twelve years ago, at this time, the political life of the Polish people experienced a grand event, that is, the reorganization of the Polish Committee of National Liberation into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, which was also a great encouragement to the Chinese people who were striving for their own liberation at that time. Over the past twelve years, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government, the Polish people have carried out arduous work to create and build their motherland. Poland has changed from a pre-war agricultural country into a socialist industrialized country. You have established a series of new industrial sectors, as evidenced by the Lenin Iron and Steel Works we visited today. The Chinese people have always been concerned about your socialist construction and are happy for the achievements you have made.

    In international affairs, Poland has consistently adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, actively striving to ease international tensions and safeguard collective security in Europe. In particular, it should be pointed out that, as a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Supervisory and Control Commissions in Indochina, Poland has made important contributions to peace in Asia, which are sincerely appreciated by the Chinese people and all peace-loving people of Asia.

    Premier Zhou said that recently, Poland's political life has undergone new changes. The Polish United Workers' Party has taken some new measures to correct past mistakes and deviations based on the wishes and demands of the broad masses of working people. Not long ago, the friendly talks between Poland and the Soviet Union re-laid a solid foundation for the friendly relations between the two countries, which had a positive impact on both countries and other socialist countries. The Chinese people believe that under the leadership of the Polish government and the United Workers' Party, the Polish people will continue to achieve new successes in consolidating and developing the socialist system and further developing the national economy, and will make new contributions to strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between socialist countries.

    Speaking of Sino-Polish relations, Premier Zhou said that in recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have greatly developed. China is still a relatively backward country, and we have much to learn from you. In our socialist construction, the Polish people have made contributions. You have manufactured complete sets of machinery and equipment for us, you have sent experts to assist us in construction, and your schools have educated students for us. The Chinese people are very grateful for this. The Polish people can be confident that on the common road of building socialism, the Chinese people are willing to advance shoulder to shoulder with the Polish people and work together for the peace, happiness, and bright future of mankind.

    Premier Zhou emphasized that the prosperity and progress of our common cause are always hated by the enemies of peace and human progress—the reactionary forces of imperialism. They have never given up their conspiracies to sabotage us. We must strengthen unity, strengthen the unity of the people at home, and strengthen the unity between the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. Facts have proved that as long as we are good at distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy and unite closely, any imperialist conspiracies and tricks will inevitably be defeated.

    Premier Zhou Enlai finally said that the more prosperous and powerful the socialist countries are, the more consolidated and developed our unity will be, and the more guaranteed will be world peace and the cause of human progress. Although the international situation has been temporarily tense during this period due to the aggressive and destructive activities of international reactionary forces, they still cannot escape failure. The awakening of the people of the world and their determination to safeguard peace will certainly not allow the imperialist conspiracies to succeed. In our era, no force can stop the advance of the wheels of history, and the sacred cause of world peace and human progress will surely achieve final victory.

    周恩来总理的讲话（摘要）
    中国人民衷心感谢波兰对于亚洲和平所作的重大贡献。　在我们的社会主义建设中有波兰人民的劳绩。　中国人民愿意同波兰人民一齐为人类和平幸福和美好的未来努力。　只要我们善于分清敌我，紧密团结起来，帝国主义的任何阴谋必将失败。
    新华社克拉科夫14日电　周恩来总理13日在波兰克拉科夫市群众大会上发表了演说。
    周总理首先代表中国人民向到会的人致兄弟的热烈敬礼，他说：中国政府代表团中间的大多数人还是第一次来访问克拉科夫，但是我们早就向往这个有长久历史的文化古城。这里有历史悠久的雅吉隆大学，它曾经培养出举世闻名的伟大科学家哥白尼。我们十分感谢克拉科夫市长的安排，使我们有机会和克拉科夫的各界代表和人民见面。
    周总理接着说，十二年前的这个时候，波兰人民的政治生活，经历了一次盛大的事件，那就是波兰民族解放委员会改组为波兰共和国临时政府，这件事情对于当时正在争取自己解放的中国人民也是一个极大的鼓舞。十二年来，波兰人民在波兰统一工人党和政府的领导下，为缔造和建设自己的祖国进行了艰巨的工作。波兰已经从战前的农业国家变成社会主义工业化的国家。你们建立了一系列新的工业部门，我们今天所参观的列宁冶金联合企业就是一个证明。中国人民一贯关心你们的社会主义建设事业，并且为你们所获得的成就感到高兴。
    在国际事务方面，波兰一贯坚持和平的外交政策，积极地为缓和国际紧张局势和维护欧洲的集体安全而斗争。特别应该指出，作为朝鲜中立国监察委员会和印度支那国际监督和监察委员会的成员，波兰对于亚洲的和平作出了重要贡献，这是中国人民和所有爱好和平的亚洲人民衷心感谢的。
    周总理说，最近，波兰的政治生活又经历了新的变化。波兰统一工人党根据广大劳动人民的愿望和要求，为修正过去的错误和偏差，采取了一些新的措施。不久以前，波兰和苏联的友好会谈，为波苏两国的友好关系重新奠定了坚固的基础，对于两国和其他社会主义国家都产生了良好的影响。中国人民相信，波兰人民在波兰政府和统一工人党的领导下，在巩固和发展社会主义制度和进一步发展国民经济方面，必将继续取得新的成就，而在加强社会主义各国间的友好合作关系方面必将作出新的贡献。
    在谈到中波关系的时候，周总理说，近年来，我们两国间的友好合作关系有了很大的发展。中国还是一个比较落后的国家，我们有许多东西要向你们学习，在我们的社会主义建设事业中，有着波兰人民的劳绩。你们为我们制造成套的机器设备，你们派遣专家协助我们建设，你们的学校为我们教育学生，对此，中国人民非常感谢。波兰人民可以相信，在建设社会主义的共同道路上，中国人民愿意同波兰人民并肩前进，一齐为人类的和平幸福和美好的未来努力。
    周总理强调指出，我们共同事业的繁荣和进步总是和平和人类进步的敌人——帝国主义反动势力所仇视的。他们从来没有放弃过对我们进行破坏活动的阴谋。我们必须加强团结，加强国内人民的团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的团结。事实证明，只要我们善于分清敌我，一致紧密团结起来，帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计都必然遭到失败。
    周恩来总理最后说，社会主义国家愈是繁荣和强大，我们之间的团结愈是巩固和发展，对世界和平和人类进步事业就愈有保障。尽管在这一时期内，由于国际反动势力进行侵略和破坏的活动，国际局势有了一时的紧张，但是它们仍然不能免于失败，全世界人民的觉悟和维护和平的决心一定不会让帝国主义的阴谋得逞。在我们这个时代，没有任何力量能阻挡历史的车轮的前进，世界和平和人类进步的神圣的事业一定会取得最后的胜利的。
