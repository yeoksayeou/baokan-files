    Blind Commune Member Becomes a Model
    Chen Wushi, a member of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative who is blind and has lost both parents, was recently selected as a model commune member. Last year, the cooperative achieved a bumper harvest, and Chen Wushi, relying on his own labor, received more than 500 jin of grain and more than 50 yuan in cash. His income increased more than twofold compared to before joining the cooperative, when he relied solely on rent from the two and a half mu of land he received during land reform.
    The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative is located in Yanggu Township, Xianyou County, Fujian Province, and was established as an advanced agricultural cooperative in March of last year. Chen Wushi was admitted as a member at that time and received "Five Guarantees" treatment. Other members often helped him sweep the floor and wash his clothes. Therefore, Chen Wushi, who had lived as an orphan for sixteen years, was so moved that he said to everyone he met: "I have a home now."
    Shortly after Chen Wushi joined the cooperative, there was a drought, and all the cooperative's labor force participated in the work of fighting the drought and rush-planting. Chen Wushi was saddened that he could not work for the cooperative because he was blind, and he could not sleep for several nights. One morning, he suddenly came to the pond where the commune members were drawing water to fight the drought, leaning on his cane and feeling his way, insisting that he be allowed to participate in the water drawing to fight the drought. He started by failing, but he was not discouraged. After several days of tenacious efforts, with the help of other commune members, he finally learned to draw water. Later, he also learned many other tasks such as binding rice straw and operating a windmill. He also participated in other activities of the cooperative. In the evening, when the commune members went to the people's school to learn culture, he followed along. He said, "You have eyes to learn culture, and I have ears to learn revolutionary principles."

    瞎眼社员当模范
    光明农业社双目失明、失去双亲的社员陈乌狮，最近被评选为模范社员。去年这个社获得丰收，陈乌狮依靠自己的劳动，分到了五百多斤粮食和五十多元现金。他的收入比入社前单纯依靠土地改革中分到的两亩半田的租金，增加了两倍多。
    光明农业社在福建省仙游县阳谷乡，是去年3月建立的高级农业社。陈乌狮就是在那个时候被吸收为社员，受到“五保”户的优待。别的社员经常帮助他扫地，洗衣服。因此，过了十六年孤儿生活的二十七岁的陈乌狮，感动得逢人就说：“我有了家了。”
    陈乌狮入社后不久，恰逢天旱，社里全部劳动力都参加了抗旱抢种工作。陈乌狮因自己双目失明而无法给社里工作，难过得几个晚上睡不着觉。有一天早晨，他突然拄着手杖，一步一摸地来到社员们戽水抗旱的池塘边，坚持要求让他参加戽水抗旱。他开始尝试失败了，可是并不灰心。经过几天顽强的努力，在别的社员帮助下，终于学会了戽水。以后，他又学会了捆稻草、摇风车等许多工作。他还参加社里其他的活动。晚上社员们上民校学文化，他也跟着去。他说：“你们有眼睛学文化，我有耳朵学革命道理。”　新华社
