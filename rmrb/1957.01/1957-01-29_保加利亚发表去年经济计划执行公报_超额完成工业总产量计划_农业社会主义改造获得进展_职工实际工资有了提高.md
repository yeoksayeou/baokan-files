Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 27th: The Bulgarian Council of Ministers' Central Statistical Bureau published a communiqué on January 26th regarding the execution of the 1956 National Economic Development Plan, stating: In 1956, Bulgaria's total industrial output plan was fulfilled by 104%, exceeding the production level stipulated for this year in the Second Five-Year Plan by 3%, and was 16% higher than in 1955.

This year, Bulgaria produced 2,397 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, 246,700 tons of crude oil, 7,682,300 tons of brown coal, 129,500 tons of steel, 100,540 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, 858,900 tons of cement, over 141 million meters of cotton cloth, and 12,700,200 meters of woolen fabrics. The production levels of several industrial sectors even exceeded the production levels stipulated for 1957 in the Five-Year Plan, such as the metallurgical and chemical industry exceeding by 25%, the chemical industry exceeding by 42%, the production of building materials exceeding by 8%, and the paper-making and leather and shoe industries exceeding by 14%.

The communiqué pointed out that in 1956, Bulgarian agriculture took a major step forward on the road to socialist transformation. The number of agricultural production cooperatives increased from 2,735 in January 1956 to 3,100 in January 1957, while the land area of the cooperatives increased from 2,582,400 decares (each decare equals one and a half mu) to 3,521,700 decares. Three-quarters of agricultural products this year came from the socialist sector.

In 1956, the country's agriculture received 6,790 new tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 986 harvesting combines (490 of which were manufactured domestically), and over 6,600 other agricultural machines.

In terms of agricultural production, because a considerable area suffered from drought and hail in 1956, the yields of several major agricultural products, such as wheat, corn, sunflower, raw cotton, and tobacco, were about 64% to 89% of the previous year's output. However, thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria will not experience a shortage of grain and food.

The communiqué concluded by saying that in 1956, the number of employees in various sectors of the national economy increased by 33,607 compared to 1955. Due to the reduction in the prices of consumer goods, the working people benefited by approximately 1 billion leva (Bulgarian currency) in a year. The actual wages of workers increased by more than 10% this year.

Editor's Note: The main task of Bulgaria's Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) is to greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, ensure significant development of agriculture, and eliminate the backwardness of animal husbandry. In the industrial sector, priority is to be given to the development of electricity, coal, and non-ferrous metal smelting industries, and gradually expand the production of daily necessities. The plan stipulates that by 1957, the total industrial output will increase by approximately 60% compared to 1952, with electricity increasing by 100%, coal by 89%, and machinery manufacturing by 83%. The total agricultural output will increase by 66% compared to 1952.

In the first three years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the annual plans were successfully completed each year. In 1953, the production plan for total industrial output was completed by 100.6%, an increase of 12% compared to 1952. Grain production increased by approximately 25% compared to 1952. In 1954, industry completed 101.7% of the annual gross output plan, an increase of 8.7% in total industrial production compared to 1953. In 1955, the total industrial output plan was completed by 104.5%, and the total industrial output increased by 9.6% compared to 1954. Total grain output increased by 22% compared to 1954.

    保加利亚发表去年经济计划执行公报
    超额完成工业总产量计划
    农业社会主义改造获得进展　职工实际工资有了提高
    新华社索非亚27日电　保加利亚部长会议中央统计局1月26日发表1956年发展国民经济计划执行情况的公报说：1956年保加利亚工业总产量的计划完成了104％，超过第二个五年计划所规定的这一年的生产水平3％，而比1955年多16％。
    这一年，保加利亚生产了二十三亿九千七百万度电，二十四万六千七百吨原油，七百六十八万二千三百吨褐煤，十二万九千五百吨钢，十万零五千四百吨氮肥，八十五万八千九百吨水泥，一亿四千一百多万公尺棉布，一千二百七十万二千公尺毛织品。有不少工业部门的生产水平还超过了五年计划所规定的1957年生产水平，如冶金化学工业超过了25％，化学工业超过了42％，建筑材料的生产超过了8％，造纸工业、皮革、制鞋工业超过了14％。
    公报指出，1956年保加利亚农业在社会主义改造的道路上前进了一大步。农业生产合作社的数目从1956年1月的二千七百三十五个增加到1957年1月的三千一百个，而合作社的土地面积从二百五十八万二千四百狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）增加到三百五十二万一千七百狄卡尔。这一年有四分之三的农产品是从社会主义部分来的。
    1956年全国农业获得了六千七百九十台新的拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、九百八十六台收获联合机（其中四百九十台是本国制造的）和六千六百多部其他农业机器。
    在农业生产方面，由于1956年相当大的地区遭受了旱灾和雹灾，几种主要农产品如小麦、玉米、向日葵、原棉、烟草等的产量约相当于前一年产量的64％到89％。但是由于苏联的援助，保加利亚将不会感到粮食和食品的缺乏。
    公报最后说，1956年国民经济各部门的职工比1955年增加了三万三千六百零七人。由于消费品物价的降低，劳动人民在一年中获益约十亿列弗（保币）。这一年职工的实际工资增加了10％以上。
    编者注：保加利亚第二个五年计划（1953年—1957年）的主要任务是大大提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。保证使农业得到显著的发展，消除饲畜业的落后现象。在工业方面则要优先发展电力、煤和有色金属冶炼业，并逐步扩大日用品的生产。计划规定到1957年工业总产量将比1952年增加约60％，其中电力增加一倍，煤增加89％，机器制造业增加83％。农业总产量将比1952年增加66％。
    第二个五年计划的前三年，每年都胜利地完成了年度计划。1953年工业总产量的生产计划完成了100.6％，比1952年增加了12％。谷物生产量较1952年增加约25％。1954年工业完成了年度总产量计划101.7％，比1953年工业生产总额增加了8.7％。1955年工业总产量计划完成了104.5％，工业总产量比1954年增加了9.6％。谷物总产量比1954年增加了22％。
