　　Xinhua News Agency, Heihe, 28th. Chinese survey team 301 and 302 drilling units, along with Soviet drilling units, are drilling into the hard riverbed at the Lianyin and Jialinda hydroelectric dam sites, the future giant hydroelectric stations on the upper reaches of the Heilong River. A suitable dam site for the reservoir will be selected through the arduous work of scientists and technicians from both countries.
　　Riverbed drilling on ice is a first in our country. It is much easier than setting up pontoon bridges for drilling on other rivers, but in Mohe, the northernmost region of China, the temperature is often around minus forty degrees, making drilling work exceptionally difficult. Diesel engines are very difficult to start in the severe cold of minus forty degrees. The workers use a non-stop method, starting it every ten minutes or so, rotating it for two or three minutes before stopping, to maintain a certain temperature inside the machine. The piercing northwest wind makes work very inconvenient, but the drilling team, encouraged by the broad prospects of developing the Heilong River and equipped with excellent cold protection gear, overcame those astonishing extremes of cold.
　　Another part of the survey team has moved into the preparatory measurement work and formal study phase. They also spent a month conducting surveying work in the severe cold of minus forty degrees. They built a survey base in Lianyin, on the edge of the forest, cut out a seven-kilometer-long survey line from the dense forest, buried benchmarks, and carried out the connection measurement of the water level on both banks, laying the foundation for the next step of the survey.
　　The Chinese survey team working on the river of friendship has received great help from the Soviet side in their work and life. At the beginning of the drilling, due to the lack of experience of Chinese technicians in drilling in severe cold weather, the diesel engine froze up. Soviet technicians taught them to use a mixture of diesel and gasoline for combustion, solving this difficulty. The Soviet people and the Soviet survey team on the opposite bank also took meticulous care of the living conditions of the Chinese survey personnel. When the captain of the Heilong River survey team went to Beijing for a meeting, the captain of the Soviet survey team, Balyev, also took care of the work of the Chinese survey team. These things have greatly encouraged the young Chinese survey team members. They expressed that they must learn from the Soviet comrades and complete the drilling task ahead of schedule.
　　The Lianyin and Jialinda hydroelectric stations are two of the five hydroelectric stations planned by China and the Soviet Union in the Heilong River basin, and are important projects for the development of water resources in the Heilong River basin.

### 中苏两国勘测队员  冒严寒在冰上钻探河床

    中苏两国勘测队员
    冒严寒在冰上钻探河床
    新华社黑河28日电　在黑龙江上游未来的巨型水电站——连崟、加林达水电站坝址上，进行冰上河床钻探的我国勘测队三○一和三○二钻探机组，和苏联方面的钻探机组一道，正在坚硬的河床内钻进。一个适宜水库拦河坝的坝址，将经过两国科学家及技术工人的艰苦劳动选择出来。
    冰上河床钻探在我国还是创举，这比在其他河流上搭设浮桥钻探容易得多，但是我国最北方的严寒的漠河地区，温度经常是在零下四十度左右，进行钻探工作是异常艰苦的。柴油发动机在零下四十度的严寒天气里很难发动，工人用昼夜不停的办法，每隔十数分钟发动一次，旋转二三分钟后即停止，以保持机器内部的一定温度。刺骨的西北风吹来，工作虽然很不方便，但是钻探队员在开发黑龙江的广阔远景鼓舞下，而且有着很好防寒装配条件，克服了那些惊人的奇寒。
    勘测队的另一部分人员，已转入准备测量工作和正规学习阶段。他们也曾在零下四十度的严寒，进行了一个月的测量工作。他们在森林边缘的连崟修建了勘测基地，从密林中砍出了七公里长的测量视线，埋设了水准点，并且进行了两岸水准的联测工作，给下一步勘测打下了基础。
    工作在友谊河流上的我国勘测队员，在工作和生活上，得到苏联方面的很大帮助。钻探开始时，因我国技术人员缺乏在严寒的气候下进行钻探的经验，曾发生柴油发动机冻住的现象，苏联的技术人员，就告诉他们采用柴油和汽油混合燃烧的办法，解决了这个困难。对岸的苏联人民和苏联勘测队，对我国勘测人员在生活上的照顾也无微不至。当黑龙江勘测队队长去北京开会时，苏联勘测队队长巴列耶夫还照顾我国勘测队的工作。这些，对我国年轻的勘测队员鼓舞很大。他们表示，一定要好好向苏联同志学习，提前完成钻探任务。
    连崟、加林达水电站是中苏两国在黑龙江流域计划建设的五个水电站之一，是开发黑龙江流域水利资源有重要意义的工程。
