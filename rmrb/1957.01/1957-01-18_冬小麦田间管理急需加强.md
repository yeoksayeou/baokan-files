    Winter Wheat Field Management Needs Urgent Strengthening

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of Agriculture has learned that the total winter wheat planting area in sixteen major wheat-producing provinces (regions) across the country last winter reached over 359 million mu, an increase of approximately 5 million mu compared to 1955.

    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the quality of winter wheat sown last winter was generally good across the country, and the area of improved varieties推广 (tuī guǎng - promotion/popularization) was larger than in any previous year. However, due to the impact of rain and rust on wheat seed quality in some areas during last year's wheat harvest; the increased area of replanting in many areas last year and late harvesting of summer-sown crops; coupled with drought in some areas before and after wheat sowing, and the slow drainage of accumulated water in flood-affected areas, the wheat sowing work in these areas was very rushed, leading to rough sowing and many missing seedlings. This situation appears more serious in some areas of Henan, Hubei, southern Shanxi, and northern Jiangsu, with generally around 20% missing seedlings. There are also cases of careless sowing and poor wheat emergence in Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Anhui. At the same time, many areas did not apply enough fertilizer during autumn sowing and winter planting, and even planted seeds directly into barren soil. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture believes that quickly and conscientiously organizing farmers to strengthen wheat field management, further improving spring frost prevention work and accumulating and applying fertilizer to promote wheat tillering and change wheat growth conditions is a major key to striving for increased wheat production this year. In spring drought areas in the north, it is also necessary to pay attention to drought prevention in wheat fields and actively expand the area of wheat field irrigation. In the south, wheat fields should also be strengthened with weeding, soil cultivation, and ditch drainage to protect the smooth development and growth of wheat.

### 冬小麦田间管理急需加强

    冬小麦田间管理急需加强
    据新华社讯　新华社记者从农业部获悉：去冬全国十六个主要产麦省（区）冬小麦的播种面积共达三亿五千九百多万亩，比1955年增加了五百万亩左右。
    据农业部了解，去冬全国各地播种的冬小麦，播种质量一般还好，良种推广的面积也比以往任何一年大。但是由于去年麦收时期有些地区因雨水和锈病为害，麦种的质量受到影响；去年不少地区复种面积增加，夏播作物收获晚；加上种麦前后部分地区发生干旱，水灾地区的积水又排退较迟，这就使得这些地区的小麦播种工作时间很紧迫，出现了播种粗糙和缺苗多的问题。这种情况在河南、湖北、山西南部和江苏北部某些地区显得比较严重，一般缺苗都在20％左右，在河北、山东、陕西和安徽等地，也有播种不细致和小麦出苗不好的情况。同时，不少地区秋播冬种中所施肥料不足，甚至还有白地下种的现象。为此，农业部认为，迅速而认真地组织农民加强麦田管理，进一步做好春冻预防工作和积肥追肥工作，以促进小麦分蘖、改变小麦的生长情况，是争取今年小麦增产的重大关键。北方春旱地区还必须注意麦田防旱，积极扩大麦田的浇、灌面积。南方的麦田也要加强锄草、培土和开沟排水的工作，以保护小麦的顺利发育生长。
