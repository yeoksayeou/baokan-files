Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th - Scientific research institutions in Tianjin's various business departments are conducting research activities in coordination with the production and work of relevant departments.

    The research institutions of the industrial sector mainly assist factories in researching and trial-manufacturing new products and improving product quality, and have already achieved initial results. Since its establishment in November last year, the Central Laboratory of Tianjin Paint and Pigment Industry Company has assisted factories in successfully trial-manufacturing high-grade pigments for papermaking and paint colors - ultramarine blue. In the past, this pigment relied entirely on foreign imports. Now, the researchers at this laboratory are also researching pigments for paints, rubber, and other applications. Last year, the Central Laboratory of Tianjin Pigment Chemical Industry Company completed a total of eight research projects. Among them, the acid-resistant scarlet successfully trial-manufactured has already been put into production. This pigment has brighter color, better fastness, and acid resistance than the red previously used. The researchers at this laboratory also regularly visit various factories to study production technology issues and help factories determine technical conditions.

    The Tianjin Textile Bureau's Experimental Research Office has conducted research on improving the technology and processes of old factories, based on the equipment conditions of Tianjin's cotton textile factories. The engineering and technical personnel's design of converting the two-pass roving frame into a single-pass shortened the process. It can not only save machinery and equipment, electricity, and labor, but also improve the quality of cotton yarn.

    Research laboratories in the health field, such as oncology, orthopedics, and pediatrics, are conducting special research on some major and difficult diseases under the leadership of some well-known medical experts in Tianjin. At present, there are a total of twenty-six scientific research institutions in various business departments in Tianjin, with more than one thousand researchers participating in the work. Among them, eighteen research institutions were established only last year.

    天津各业务部门的科学研究机构
    配合生产、工作进行研究活动
    新华社天津7日电　天津市各业务部门的科学研究机构，正在配合各有关部门的生产、工作，进行研究活动。
    工业部门的研究机构主要是协助工厂研究试制新产品和提高产品质量，并且已经获得初步成绩。天津市油漆颜料工业公司中心试验室在去年11月成立以后，已经协助工厂试制成功造纸、漆色等方面用的高级颜料——群青，这种颜料过去一直是依靠国外进口的。现在，这个试验室的研究人员又在研究油漆、橡胶等方面用的颜料。天津市颜料化学工业公司中心试验室去年共完成了八项研究，其中试制成功的耐酸朱红已经投入生产，这种颜料比过去用的煮红，色泽明亮、牢度和耐酸度也都很好。这个试验室的研究人员还经常到各个工厂去研究生产技术问题，帮助工厂确定技术条件。
    天津纺织管理局试验研究室根据天津市棉纺织厂的设备条件，进行了改进老厂技术、工艺的研究。工程技术人员们完成的二道粗纱机改为单程的设计，缩短了工艺过程，不但可以节约机器设备、电力和人力，而且可以提高棉纱的质量。
    卫生方面的瘤科、骨科、儿科等研究室，正在天津市一些著名的医学专家的领导下，进行一些重大的疑难病症的专题研究。目前天津市各业务部门共有二十六个科学研究机构，参加研究的工作人员有一千多人。其中有十八个研究机构是去年才成立的。
