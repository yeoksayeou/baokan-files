We are facing difficulties that are difficult to solve ourselves
County Head of Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, Jia Shoude; Deputy County Heads Wang Deyu, Lü Chuande

Editor's Note: This article illustrates that county-level organs are currently encountering many practical difficulties in overcoming bureaucracy and improving leadership style, and these difficulties are caused by higher-level organs. The shortcomings in the leadership style and methods of leading organs above the county level cannot but affect the leadership of county-level organs, making their work passive, chaotic, and even "knowingly committing mistakes." Therefore, to overcome bureaucracy, efforts must be made from top to bottom. Only by improving the leadership style and methods of higher-level leading organs can more favorable conditions be created for lower-level leading organs to improve leadership.

On October 23, the People's Daily published a letter from a Party member entitled "A County Head Who Only 'Commands' but Does Not 'Take the Field'," which made appropriate criticisms of our work. We have already conducted a review at the expanded meeting of the Party group of the county People's Committee and studied ways to improve leadership methods. We welcome this kind of comradely criticism and assistance.

However, at the same time, it should also be pointed out that we are facing some difficulties that are difficult to solve ourselves, and these difficulties are one of the main reasons for many shortcomings in our work. Because these difficulties cannot be resolved, we often knowingly commit mistakes. Therefore, it is necessary for us to bring up these difficulties.

I. We don't have time to arrange government work, and our days are taken up by countless meetings. The three of us have calculated our working hours, and 60% to 70% of our time is spent on various meetings. One of us, from March 1 to September 5, spent 76 days attending meetings convened by the Special Commissioner's Office and the Provincial People's Committee on the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, health work conferences, planning conferences, etc.; 30 days attending political consultation meetings, people's congresses, and Party congresses (including preparatory meetings) convened by the county; and an average of 10 days per month (including preparatory meetings) attending the three-level cadre conferences (or township Party branch secretary conferences) convened by the county Party committee, totaling 60 days. The total time spent on the above meetings was 166 days. The time spent working in the countryside was only 18 days, so the time we actually have to handle our own work is too little. Because these meetings take up too much time and are unscheduled, they disrupt our own planned work. For example, when certain administrative meetings that need to be chaired by us have already been notified or are in progress, we receive a temporary notice to convene a county Party committee meeting. We have to postpone the administrative meeting, suspend it halfway, or end it hastily. The postponed meetings are often delayed indefinitely. The time agreed with comrades to study work is also delayed repeatedly due to meetings, losing credibility. Although we explain at any time, various bureaus and sections still have many opinions. Although collective discussions are held on certain major issues, the time is too short and rough, and everyone's enthusiasm cannot be fully utilized. In this case, the handling of general documents is even more lacking in seriousness and prudence. We often bring some documents to read while attending county Party committee meetings, or use the time in the morning for study to read them. Many documents are signed for handling without collective research or in-depth personal reflection. In this way, we are actually violating the principle of collective leadership. But what else can we do? If we had to handle all the documents, we would become immersed in事務主义 [事務主義, Shìwù zhǔyì. This is a term that refers to focusing on trivial administrative matters instead of broader political or strategic concerns.] and bureaucracy. For this reason, we have also roughly divided the documents into two categories: those belonging to the instructions of higher authorities, notices of certain changes in policies, work deployments involving a wide range, issues related to the development of undertakings, comprehensive planning issues, and instructions and notices issued by the county People's Committee to its subordinate district offices and township People's Committees all need to be handled after collective research or the county head's review and approval. General notices and documents from higher-level business departments to strengthen a certain work based on the established policies of the Party committee are directly approved by the office. But in fact, we have not been able to do this in a timely manner. The three of us commonly feel how depressing it is to be buried in piles of meetings for a long time!

II. Overlapping division of labor between the Party and the government, unclear boundaries. Based on the development of the new situation, the county Party committee has adopted a system of dividing lines of responsibility for various tasks according to their nature. Members of the county Party committee are responsible for one or several specialized tasks, and execute them separately under the unified leadership of the county Party committee. The work of the various sections and bureaus of the county People's Committee is also divided into three fronts, and the three of us are responsible for them separately. This is indeed a more scientific leadership method, but the division of labor of the various departments of the county Party committee also includes the administrative work of the various sections and bureaus of the county People's Committee, which is not connected with the division of labor of the three of us. This makes the work of each section and bureau feel multi-headed in execution. Some section chiefs reflect that studying work with the county head cannot replace the minister. This not only makes it unclear what the various departments of the Party committee should do and what the government should do, but also makes the Party committee relax its political and ideological leadership under the excessive pressure of daily administrative affairs, so that the administrative organs cannot but have a waiting and dependent mentality on the Party committee.

III. Demanding "special management, personal involvement" in everything. Although the three of us have divided the work of the People's Committee, higher authorities have designated the county head and deputy county heads to be specifically responsible for a series of tasks, such as suppression of counter-revolutionaries, grassroots elections, and grain work, and even to "disengage from production" (that is, put aside the other work they are responsible for) to specifically lead the work designated by higher authorities. When we are forced to deal with some of the work we are responsible for, we are often criticized by the "superior authorities." In this atmosphere, it further promotes our view that our work is not comprehensive enough, and in our thinking, we only attach importance to key tasks, that is, the work that higher authorities have designated us to be specifically responsible for, and relax our leadership over other tasks. In addition, the Provincial People's Committee and the Special Commissioner's Office emphasize that county heads and deputy county heads should attend many work conferences, such as water conservancy, tea production, hog production, transportation work, health work, withdrawal of districts and merging of townships, administrative staffing, wage reform, grassroots elections, planning work, and grain work. However, there are only three county heads and deputy county heads in our county, which is really not enough to meet the requirements of higher authorities for being specifically responsible for one task. This requirement of higher authorities makes it so that the tasks assigned to us at meetings convened by the Special Commissioner's Office have not yet had time to be implemented downward, and we receive a notice to convene a meeting in the province. Sometimes we even receive notices from the province and the Special Commissioner's Office at the same time, asking the county head to attend meetings. When we are running around attending various meetings and still cannot cope, we have to find a substitute. What the superiors do, the subordinates follow, and we have similar phenomena with districts and townships.

IV. There is no county head who is responsible for comprehensively leading the work of the People's Committee. The three of us are all members of the county Party committee, and without exception, we are also responsible for a task in the county Party committee, but no one is responsible for comprehensively leading this huge administrative organ of the county People's Committee. In particular, the specific leadership of strengthening the office is even worse, forming a phenomenon of division of labor and separation of families. Because the county People's Committee held fewer administrative meetings in the past, the working relationships between various departments were not resolved in a timely manner, and these working relationships gradually turned into relationships between comrades, affecting mutual unity.

V. Overlapping institutions, overstaffing. In the past year, the number of county-level institutions has not been streamlined but has increased! By December of last year, the number of county-level institutions had increased by ten compared with the previous year, and the number of staff had increased by 206 (an increase of 48% compared with the previous year). When a certain undertaking in the province develops, the province emphasizes that each county should adapt to the development of the undertaking from the organizational structure. This is necessary in some cases, but because the production bases and conditions of each county are different, the speed of their development will also be different. If we do not analyze the specific situation of each county, make demands and regulations uniformly, and force the lower levels to implement them, it will not be beneficial. For example, the change in the structure of our county's grain bureau is like this. The work of grain collection, purchase, sales, storage, transportation, and processing is all in the countryside. Last year, according to the notice from the province, the cadres who were working at the grassroots level were transferred to the county grain bureau, and six companies were established separately. The strength of the grassroots grain organizations, especially the leadership backbone and the technical backbone, was weakened. As a result, the amount of grain damaged by pests last year increased by 50% compared with the previous year. This is of course because our level is not high and we did not combine the implementation of the instructions of higher authorities with the actual situation, but it is also inseparable from the fact that higher authorities do not attach importance to the opinions reflected by lower levels. At the Third Provincial Grain Conference, we repeatedly proposed that institutions should be established according to the situation of each county, and for those institutions that have been established but are not urgently needed, we requested the Provincial People's Committee to explicitly abolish them. The Provincial People's Committee did not adopt these opinions and still insisted on adopting a method of several brands for one organ. Because the company's nameplate is hung at the door, the superior authorities ask us for cadres, such as the newly established oil and fat company, which has been equipped with 15 cadres, and the superior authorities repeatedly demand that we equip it with 30 cadres. Of course, the work of oil and fat is very important, but the current oil and fat production in our county is still very little! It is true that in the past two years, our county has indeed developed more than 100,000 mu of oil tea, but this is only the prospect of oil and fat work, and no tea seeds have been produced yet! The annual production of oil and fat raw materials in our county is only 1.3 million jin of tallow seeds, 310,000 jin of tung seeds, and about 900,000 jin of rapeseed, peanuts, sesame, etc. The purchase and processing of these oil and fat raw materials are very seasonal. We believe that the existing cadres can do a good job in the entrusted purchase, processing management, and edible oil market management of the above oil materials, and then strengthen the management of oil and fat according to the development of production. The development of oil and fat production should first strengthen the organization of the production department. It is putting the cart before the horse to emphasize the management of operations before strengthening the production force. If we want to strengthen the work of oil and fat, we will inevitably weaken the strength of grain work. Is it right to do so according to the situation of our county?

Due to the continuous transfer of a large number of staff to county-level organs, many specific problems that are difficult to solve at once have been brought about, such as crowded housing and insufficient office supplies. Also, because these things are not distributed reasonably, there are mutual opinions, which affect the work and the relationship between superiors and subordinates.

These superficial understandings and opinions of the three of us are not necessarily correct, and we ask the leadership to criticize and correct them.

    我们面对着本身难以解决的困难
    浙江省东阳县县长　贾守第　副县长　王德钰　吕传德
    编者按　这篇文章说明，目前县级机关在克服官僚主义、改进领导作风时遇到不少实际困难，这些困难是由上级机关造成的。县以上的领导机关在领导作风和方法上存在的缺点不能不影响县级机关的领导，使他们的工作陷于被动、忙乱，甚至“明知故犯”。因此，要克服官僚主义，必须进行自上而下的努力，只有上级领导机关的领导作风和领导方法改进了，才能给下级领导机关改进领导创造更有利的条件。
    人民日报10月23日登了一篇以“只‘挂帅’不‘出马’的县长”为标题的党员来信，对我们的工作提出了恰如其份的批评。我们已在县人民委员会党组扩大会议上作了检查，并且研究了改进领导的方法。我们欢迎这种同志式的批评和帮助。
    但同时，也该指出，我们正面对着一些本身很难解决的困难，这些困难是造成工作中许多缺点的主要原因之一。由于这些困难不能解决，我们往往是明知故犯。因此，我们有必要把这些困难提出来。
    一、我们没有时间安排政府工作，一天天的时间都被数不清的会议夺去了。我们三人曾算了一下工作时间的账，60％至70％的时间都用在各种会议上，其中有一人自3
  月1日到9月5日的一百八十九个工作日中，出席专署、省人民委员会召开的对私营工商业改造会、卫生工作会、计划会议等等用去七十六天；出席县召开的政治协商会、人民代表大会、党代表大会（包括预备会）用去三十天；县委召开的三级干部大会（或乡支书会）每月平均十天（包括预备会）计用去六十天，以上各种会议合计共用去一百六十六天，在农村工作的时间只有十八天，那么真正可以处理自己分管工作的时间实在太少了。因为这类会议所占用的时间过多和不定时，就把我们自己安排的工作打乱了。例如需由我们主持召开的某些行政会议，当通知已经发出或正在开会的时候，又临时接到召开县委会的通知，只好把行政会议改日再开或中途停止或草草结束，对改日再开的会议往往就被无限期的拖下去。和同志们约定研究工作的时间也因会议一再拖延，失去信用，虽然随时进行解释，但是各局、科仍有很多意见。对某些重大问题虽然进行了集体讨论，但是因为时间急促，开得了草，不能充分发挥大家的积极作用。在这种情况下，对一般公文的处理就更缺乏严肃慎重的态度。经常把公文带一部分在参加县委会议时看，或是利用早上学习的时间看。许多公文不经过集体研究，个人又未深入思考就签署办理意见。这样，实际上是违犯集体领导原则的。但不这样又怎样办才好呢？对所有的公文如果都要我们去处理，又要成为事务主义和文牍主义者。为此，我们亦曾把公文大体上分为二类：属于上级的指示，在政策上有某些变更的通知，牵扯面较广的工作部署，对事业的发展问题，全面性的计划问题，和县人民委员会下达给所属区公所、乡人民委员会的指示、通知等等，都需要经过集体研究或县长阅批后办理。属于上级业务部门在党委既定的方针政策的基础上加强某项工作的通知和一般性的公文等，由办公室直接批办。但是事实上这一点我们也没能及时作到。我们三人都共同感觉到长期埋在会议堆里的滋味是多么苦闷！
    二、党、政分工重叠，界限不清。县委根据新形势的发展，对各项工作采取了按性质分战线负责制。县委委员分管一项或几项专
  门工作，在县委统一领导下分头执
  行。县人民委员会各科、局的工作
  也分成三条战线，我们三人分工负
  责。这固然是比较科学的领导方法，
  但是县委各部的分工又包括了县人
  民委员会各科、局的事务工作，同
  我们三人的分工互不衔接。这就使各科、局的工作在执行上感到多头多脑。有的科长反映：同县长研究了工作代替不了部长。这样不但使党委各部应做什么，政府应做什么的责任分不清楚，更使党委在日常行政事务过多的压迫下，放松了政治、思想领导，使行政机构对党委不能不存在等待、依赖的思想。
    三、事事要求“专管、亲干”。我们三人对人民委员会的工作虽然进行了分工，但是上级却又将一连串的工作，如肃反、基层选举、粮食等工作都指定县长、副县长专门负责，甚至“脱产”（即丢开他所分工的其他工作）专门领导上级指定的那一项工作。到迫不得已去处理一些自己所分管的工作时，往往还要受到“条条上级”的指责。在这种气氛中就更助长了我们的工作本来就不全面的观点，在思想上只重视了重点工作，即上级指定我们专门负责的那项工作，而放松了对其他工作的领导。此外，省人民委员会、专署对许多工作会议如水利、茶叶生产、毛猪生产、交通工作、卫生工作、撤区并乡、行政编制、工资改革、基层选举、计划工作、粮食工作等会议，都强调要县长、副县长参加，但是本县县长、副县长只有三人，实在不能适应上级对专责领导一项工作的要求。上级这种要求使我们在出席专署召开的会议中所布置的任务还未来得及向下贯彻，又接到省里召开会议的通知。有时还会同时接到省、专署要县长出席会议的通知。在我们都东跑西跑的出席各种会议还应付不过来时，只得去找代替人。上行下效，我们对区、乡也有类似现象。
    四、没有分工负责全面领导人民委员会工作的县长。我们三人都是县委委员，毫无例外在县委同样分管了一项工作，但是对县人民委员会这个庞大的行政机关却无人分工负责，全面领导。特别是对加强办公室的具体领导更差，形成分工分家现象。由于过去一段县人民委员会行政会议开的较少，各部门之间在工作上的关系未能及时解决，这些工作关系逐渐转成同志之间的关系，影响了互相团结。
    五、机构重叠，人浮于事。一年来县级机构不是精简了而是增多了！至去年12月止县级机构较前年增加了十个，工作人员增加了二百零六人（比前年增加48％）。省内某项事业发展了，省里强调各县从组织机构上去适应事业的发展，这在某些情况下是需要的，但各县因为生产的基础、条件不同，其发展的速度也会有所不同。如果不分析各县的具体情况，千篇一律地提要求、规定，硬要下面执行就不会有好处。如我县粮食局机构的改变就是如此，粮食的征、购、销和保管调运加工等工作都在农村。去年根据省的通知把原在基层工作的干部调到县粮食局，分别成立了六个公司。粮食基层组织的力量，特别是领导骨干和技术骨干的力量削弱了。其结果去年的虫害粮比前年增加了50％。这固然是我们水平不高，对执行上级指示不结合实际情况所造成的，但是与上级不重视下级反映的意见也是分不开的。在全省第三次粮食会议上，我们曾再三地提出：应根据各县情况建立机构，对已经建立但又不急需的机构，要求省人民委员会再明文撤消，省人民委员会并没有采纳这些意见，仍坚持采取一套机关几个牌子的办法。因为公司的牌子挂在门口，条条上级就向我们要干部，如新成立的油脂公司，已配备了十五个干部，上级一再要求配足三十个干部。当然油脂工作是很重要的，可是我县当前的油脂生产还仅是寥寥无几呀！不错，在过去的二年我县的确发展了十多万亩油茶，可是这仅是油脂工作的前途，现在还没有茶子生产出来！本县年度生产的油脂原料仅有桕子一百三十万斤、桐子三十一万斤、菜子、花生、芝麻等约九十万斤。这些油脂原料的收购加工都有很强的季节性。我们认为现有的干部可以作好以上油料的委托收购、加工管理和食油市场管理等工作，以后再根据生产发展情况加强经营油脂的力量是可以的。油脂生产的发展，首先应加强生产部门的组织，生产力量不加强，先去强调经营的力量是本末倒置的做法。目前要加强油脂工作，势必削弱粮食工作的力量，根据本县情况这样做是否对呢？
    由于大量的工作人员陆续调集到县级机关，而带来许多具体的又是一时难以解决的问题，如房子拥挤、办公用具不够用等，又因为这些东西分配的不够合理，相互有意见，影响了工作和上下级的关系。
    我们三人以上这些粗浅的认识和意见，不一定是正确的，请求领导上加以批评、指正。
