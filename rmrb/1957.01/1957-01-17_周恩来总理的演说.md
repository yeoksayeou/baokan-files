Xinhua News Agency, Lodz, 16th -- Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at a mass rally in Lodz on the 15th.

	In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai first highly praised Lodz's glorious revolutionary tradition. He said: "Lodz is not unfamiliar to us. Your city has a glorious revolutionary tradition. The working people here have written a glorious page in the history of the Polish workers' movement. As early as more than seventy years ago, the first Polish working-class organization called 'Great Proletariat' appeared in Lodz. In 1905, the workers of Lodz held a heroic armed uprising for the liberation of the Polish people. During the dark days of Hitler's fascist occupation, Lodz was one of the centers of the Polish people's struggle for national liberation. After the liberation of Poland, the workers of Lodz engaged in the arduous task of healing war wounds, restoring the national economy, and building socialism with diligent and selfless labor, and have achieved many successes. The Chinese people are pleased with your past revolutionary traditions and the achievements you have already made.”

	Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that visits to Lodz and other cities have deeply impressed the Chinese delegates with the definite and indelible achievements the Polish people have made on the road to socialist construction, in the process of constantly overcoming difficulties. He continued, please allow me to assure you once again that the Chinese people support your lofty cause of building socialism. As members of the socialist family, China and Poland will always be close brothers. On the road to defending world peace and building socialism, the Chinese people will always advance shoulder to shoulder with the Polish people.

	Premier Zhou Enlai added that the Chinese people, like the Polish people, are also working hard to build their own country. We are implementing the final year of our first five-year plan. However, compared with your country, our China is still backward in many aspects. In order to get rid of backwardness, we still have a lot of work to do and overcome many difficulties and shortcomings. We believe that as long as we can distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, unite the whole party, unite the people of the whole country, unite all socialist countries, unite all other peace-loving countries and people in the world, adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, and maintain the style of diligence, thrift, and hard work, never be arrogant and complacent, and be good at learning from the strengths of others, we may be able to build China into a socialist industrial country during the period of three five-year plans or longer.

	Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by saying: The cause of building socialism is arduous, and it requires a long-term struggle to complete this task. But as long as we persevere, no force can stop us from achieving final victory.

    周恩来总理的演说
    新华社罗兹16日电　周恩来总理15日在罗兹举行的群众大会上发表了演说。
    周恩来总理在演说中首先盛赞了罗兹过去光荣的革命传统。他说：“罗兹对于我们并不是陌生的。你们的城市有着光荣的革命传统。这里的劳动人民在波兰工人运动史上曾经写下了光荣的一页。远在七十多年以前，罗兹就出现了叫做‘大无产’的波兰第一个工人阶级的组织。1905年，罗兹的工人们曾为了波兰人民的解放举行了英勇的武装起义。在希特勒法西斯占领的黑暗日子里，罗兹是波兰人民争取民族解放斗争的中心之一。在波兰解放以后，罗兹的工人们又以辛勤的忘我劳动从事于医治战争创伤、恢复国民经济和建设社会主义的艰巨事业，并且取得了许多成就。中国人民为你们过去的革命传统和现在已经取得的成就而感到高兴。”
    周恩来总理指出，在罗兹以及在其他城市的访问使中国代表们得到了深刻的印象，那就是波兰人民在社会主义建设的道路上，在不断克服困难的过程中已经取得了肯定的不可磨灭的成绩。他接着说，请允许我再一次向你们保证，中国人民支持你们建设社会主义的崇高事业。中波两国作为社会主义大家庭中的成员，永远是亲密的兄弟。在保卫世界和平和建设社会主义的道路上，中国人民将永远同波兰人民一起并肩前进。
    周恩来总理又说，中国人民和波兰人民一样也正在紧张地建设自己的国家，我们正在执行第一个五年计划中的最后一年计划。但是，比起你们的国家来，我们中国在许多方面还是落后的。为摆脱落后，我们还要做许多工作，克服许多困难和缺点。我们相信，只要我们能够分清敌我、团结全党、团结全国人民、团结所有社会主义国家、团结世界上其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民，坚持真理、纠正错误，并且保持勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的作风，永远不要骄傲自满，善于虚心学习别人的长处，我们就有可能在三个五年计划期间或者更长的期间，把中国建设成为一个社会主义工业国家。
    周恩来总理最后说：建设社会主义的事业是艰巨的，为了完成这个任务，需要进行长期的奋斗。但是只要我们坚持努力，没有任何力量可以阻挡我们取得最后的胜利。
