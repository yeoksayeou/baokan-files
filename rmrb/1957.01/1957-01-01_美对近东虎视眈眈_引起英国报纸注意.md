Xinhua News Agency, London, December 30th: British newspapers are paying close attention to American policy in the Near East, especially the plan to grant the U.S. President the power to freely decide on the use of American troops in the region.

Some political observers, commenting on this plan, emphasized that the U.S. is not only attempting to suppress the national liberation movements in the Near East by force but is also trying to squeeze out its rivals, Britain and France, from there. For example, the Washington correspondent of "The Observer," O'Donovan, pointed out that the United States believes that "France and Britain have lost their past influence and prestige in this region," and therefore, "the new American step is a conscious attempt to fill the vacuum created by the disappearance of the old forces."

The diplomatic observer of "The Sunday Times," Carroll, hinted that the U.S.'s proposed military measures in the Near East are primarily aimed at the people of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, who are bravely defending their independence.

    美对近东虎视眈眈
    引起英国报纸注意
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社伦敦30日讯：英国报纸非常注意美国在近东的政策，特别是关于让美国总统有权自由决定在这个地区使用美国军队的计划。
    有些政治观察家评论这个计划的时候着重指出，美国这样做不仅是企图用武力镇压近东的民族解放运动，而且竭力想从那里排挤英法两个敌手。例如“观察家报”驻华盛顿记者奥多诺文指出，美国认为，“法国和英国在这个地区已经丧失了它们过去的势力和威信”，因而，“美国新步骤就是自觉地企图填补由于旧势力的消失而形成的真空”。
    “星期日泰晤士报”外交观察家卡罗尔暗示说，美国所拟定的近东军事措施，首先是针对英勇保卫自己独立的埃及、叙利亚和约旦人民的。
