    The State Council has issued a notice on carrying out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and to support the government and cherish the people around the Spring Festival. The leading organs of the Party, government, army, and people at all levels should implement this notice conscientiously.
      Support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and support the government and cherish the people are not only of great significance in wartime but also in peacetime. In the past, during the revolutionary war, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and supporting the government and cherishing the people were decisive factors that enabled us to defeat the superior counter-revolutionary armed forces with inferior revolutionary armed forces. Now, in a time of peace, support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and support the government and cherish the people remain a strong guarantee for our army, government, and people to unite as one, overcome all difficulties, and build the motherland. Each year, the troops stationed in various localities help the masses with spring plowing and autumn harvesting. During the agricultural cooperation movement, some troops donated tractors and double-wheeled double-share plows to agricultural cooperatives. In flood-stricken areas, troops have used all their strength to rescue the lives and property of disaster-stricken people and transport and supply materials; some comrades have even sacrificed their lives in rescuing and providing disaster relief. In the disaster relief work, all the troops donated winter clothing and other materials, launching a "one or two meters" movement. Many troops have also helped local areas build roads, canals, and dikes. These are all things that only the people's army can do.
    The broad masses of the Chinese people have also spared no effort in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen. In recent years, the masses and local organs in various localities have actively supported national defense construction with manpower and material resources. A large number of young people have enthusiastically enlisted in the army. The masses have given high regard to the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and disabled soldiers. In addition to the large amount of preferential treatment funds allocated by the government each year, the masses also provide substitute farming for families of martyrs and families of servicemen who lack labor and have difficulties in life. The preferential treatment labor days after agricultural cooperation ensured that their lives improved along with the improvement of the living standards of the general public. Resettled veterans are also placed according to their specific circumstances so that they can all be put to good use. These tasks have played a major role in the construction of modern national defense, the implementation of the compulsory military service system, and the encouragement of the morale of the army.
    However, the peaceful environment of recent years has caused some people to develop some ideas of peace and complacency. In some places, preferential treatment and resettlement work have been relaxed intentionally or unintentionally. Some places have not implemented the system of preferential treatment labor days in the cooperative movement; or the preferential treatment is too small to ensure that the living standards of those receiving preferential treatment reach the level of ordinary members. Some places have not taken effective measures to solve the problems existing in the resettlement work. These phenomena must be corrected. Everyone should understand the great significance of ensuring the lives of families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and disabled soldiers to consolidating the army and boosting morale. Resettlement work is as important as conscription work. It is obviously incorrect for some people to pay less attention to resettlement work than to conscription work. It should be recognized that only by doing a good job in resettlement work can we lay the foundation for the smooth implementation of the compulsory military service system.
  The phenomenon of neglecting preferential treatment work deserves more attention after the implementation of the compulsory military service system. Some people subjectively believe that the families of conscripts have no difficulties, so there is no need to vigorously carry out preferential treatment work. However, the facts are not like this, or not entirely like this. If the families of conscripts do have serious life difficulties, they must still be taken care of by the state and the masses. Some people's families were not short of labor when they joined the army, but later, because the main laborers became ill or for other reasons, their families' lives became difficult, which should of course be taken care of. As for giving preferential treatment, care, and compensation to the families of martyrs and disabled soldiers, it is a long-term obligation of the state and the masses.
    Some people regard preferential treatment and resettlement work as merely the business of the civil affairs departments, which is not right. The civil affairs departments are the competent departments and should do their best. However, to truly do these tasks well, the entire Party must take action. Party committees and governments at all levels should pay attention to leading and inspecting this work. All organs, enterprises, and cooperatives should conscientiously and responsibly solve the problems in the preferential treatment and resettlement work of their units and should not shirk their responsibilities.
    Due to the development of national defense construction, the army must concentrate its efforts on strengthening modern military construction and improving military science and technology. The stationing and training of the army also needs to be more concentrated, and direct contact with the masses has been reduced somewhat, which is inevitable. However, some troops have therefore become less concerned about the interests of the people than in the past, and their relationship with the local party and government organs has become more distant than before, doing little or no mass work, which must also be corrected.
    Some troops sometimes do not pay enough attention to the interests of the masses in terms of housing, construction, and demarcation of restricted areas, and there are also phenomena of extravagance and waste in life and violations of mass discipline. These should be dealt with promptly and seriously. The troops stationed in various localities must educate officers and soldiers to continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of safeguarding the interests of the masses, caring for the lives of the masses, and sharing weal and woe with the masses, and to be exemplary in abiding by the laws, decrees, and policies of the state. All officers and soldiers should realize that the people's army can only be invincible if it is closely united with the masses and relies on the full support of the masses.
    In the activities of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and supporting the government and caring for the people, it is also necessary to focus on solving some specific problems, and not just carry out some get-togethers and condolences and consider it done. Party committees at all levels should organize the forces of the Party, government, army, and people to conduct in-depth inspections of the problems in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen, resettling veterans, and supporting the government and caring for the people. Those that can be solved should be solved immediately, and those that cannot be solved immediately should be classified and arranged in order, and steps should be taken to gradually solve them in future work.

### 拥军优属！拥政爱民！

    拥军优属！拥政爱民！
    国务院发出了关于在春节前后开展拥军优属和拥政爱民工作的通知。各级党、政、军、民的领导机关应该按照这个通知，切实加以执行。
      拥军优属和拥政爱民不仅在战争时期有重要的意义，而且在和平时期也有重要的意义。过去在革命战争时期中，拥军优属和拥政爱民曾经是我们能以劣势的革命武装战胜优势的反革命武装的决定因素。现在处于和平的时期，拥军优属和拥政爱民仍然是我们的军、政、民团结一致、战胜一切困难、建设祖国的有力保证。各地驻军每年都帮助群众进行春耕和秋收。在农业合作化运动中有的部队把拖拉机和双轮双铧犁捐献给农业合作社。在洪水泛滥的地方，部队曾以全力抢救受灾人民的生命财产，运输供应物资；有的同志还因抢险救灾而献出了自己的生命。在救灾工作中各个部队都捐献了寒衣和其他物资，开展一两米运动。还有许多部队帮助地方上修路、修渠、修堤。这些都是只有人民的军队才能够做到的。
    我国广大的人民群众对于拥军优属的工作也是不遗余力的。近几年来，各地群众和地方机关用人力物力积极支持了国防建设。广大青年踊跃应征入伍。群众对烈属、军属、残废军人给予高度关怀。除了政府每年拨出大量的优抚费以外，对缺乏劳动力而生活困难的烈属、军属，群众还给予代耕。在农业合作化以后的优待劳动日，保证了他们的生活随一般群众生活水平的提高而提高。对复员军人也分别情况进行安置，使之各得其所。这些工作，对于现代化国防的建设，对于义务兵役制的推行，对于鼓舞军队的士气，都起了很大的作用。
    但是，近几年来的和平环境，使一部分人产生了一些和平麻痹思想。对于优抚工作和复员安置工作，有的地方却有意无意地放松了。有些地方没有把合作化运动中优待劳动日的制度贯彻下去；或者优待偏少，不能保障受优待者的生活达到一般社员的水平。有些地方对复员安置工作中存在的问题没有采取有效的措施加以解决。这些现象是必须纠正的。人人都应该懂得保障烈属、军属、残废军人的生活对巩固部队、鼓舞士气的重大意义。复员安置工作和征兵工作也是同等重要的。有些人对复员安置工作不如对征兵工作那样重视，这显然是不正确的。应该认识，只有做好复员安置工作才能为顺利地推行义务兵役制打下基础。
  忽视优抚工作的现象，在义务兵役制实行以后更加值得注意。有些人主观地认为义务兵家属没有困难，所以不必要大力进行优抚工作了。但是，事实并不是这样，或者不完全是这样。义务兵的家属如果确有严重的生活困难，还必须由国家和群众予以照顾。有些人入伍的时候家庭并不缺乏劳动力，但是，后来因为主要劳动者患病或其他原因，家属的生活发生了困难，这当然是应该给予照顾的。至于对烈士家属和残废军人，给以优待、照顾和抚恤，则是国家和群众的一项长期的义务。
    有人把优抚和复员安置工作仅仅看作是民政部门的事，这是不对的。民政部门是主管部门，应该全力去做。但是，要想真正做好这些工作，就必须全党动手。各级党委和政府应当注意领导和检查这一工作。各机关、企业、合作社对本单位优抚和复员安置工作中的问题应该认真负责地加以解决，不应推托责任。
    由于国防建设的发展，军队要集中力量加强现代化的军事建设，提高军事科学技术水平。军队的驻防和训练也需要更加集中，同群众的直接接触减少一些，这是难免的。但有些部队因此就对人民群众的利益不像过去那样关心，与地方党政机关的关系也较前疏远起来，很少做甚至不做群众工作，这种现象同样必须加以纠正。
    有些部队在住房、施工、划定禁区等方面有时对群众的利益注意不够，在生活方面也有铺张浪费以及违犯群众纪律的现象发生。这些都应当及时地严肃地加以处理。各地驻军必须教育官兵继续发扬维护群众利益、关心群众生活、与群众共甘苦的光荣传统，模范地遵守国家的法律、法令和政策。应当使全体官兵都认识到，人民军队只有同群众紧密团结，依靠群众的全力支持，才能是永远不可战胜的。
    在拥军优属、拥政爱民工作中，还必须着重解决若干具体问题，不要只是进行一些联欢和慰问就算完事。各级党委应该组织党、政、军、民的力量，对拥军优属、安置复员军人和拥政爱民工作中的问题进行深入检查，能解决的立即解决，不能立即解决的分类排队，定出步骤，在今后的工作中逐步加以解决。
