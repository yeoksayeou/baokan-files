	A Bucket of Cold Water
	The counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary once greatly excited West German militarists and the American cold war strategists behind them, who saw it as a good opportunity to accelerate the rearmament of West Germany. The American "New York Times" once wishfully stated that the Hungarian incident "shook Germany" and "led to the accelerated rearmament of Germany." The newspaper even gloated that the Hungarian incident shattered the "illusions" of those who advocated withdrawing from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and seeking a unified Germany through "compromise with the Soviet Union."
	Encouraged by the American cold war strategists, the West German government, eager to accelerate rearmament, assumed that things would go smoothly. They even fancifully conducted a public opinion poll, hoping to use it to boost their accelerated rearmament measures. To this end, as the "West German Daily" pointed out, "most West German newspapers made considerable efforts to influence residents to express their attitudes." However, contrary to their wishes, despite the great efforts made by the West German authorities, the results of the public opinion poll still gave these militarists a resounding slap in the face.
	Among those questioned in this survey, the majority believed that the Soviet army's assistance in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion at the request of the Hungarian government was in the interest of peace, and the Soviet Union had no other choice.
	On the issue of accelerating rearmament, 60% of the people believed that there was no reason to rush to rebuild the army at present. The West German "Telegraph" considered this number to be "unexpectedly high."
	At the same time, 89% of the people condemned the Bonn government's plan to "cut off contact" with East Germany and favored contact between the governments of the two German states to unify Germany.
	Just as the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary suffered a tragic defeat, the attempt by West German militarists and American cold war strategists to use this to stir up pro-militarist sentiment in West Germany also failed. The West German "New Rhine News" commented on the results of this public opinion poll, saying that it "seems to have poured a bucket of cold water on Bonn." This comment is obviously very appropriate. However, it should be pointed out that this bucket of cold water was not only poured on the Bonn authorities, but also on the heads of the American cold war strategists.

    一瓢冷水
    匈牙利的反革命叛乱曾经使西德军国主义者和站在他们背后的美国冷战策划者大为兴奋，认为这是他们加速推进重新武装西德的一个好机会。美国“纽约时报”就曾一相情愿地说，匈牙利事件“震撼了德国”，并且“导致了德国重整军备的加速进行”。这家报纸甚至得意忘形地表示，匈牙利事件使主张退出北大西洋公约组织和“同苏联妥协”来求得统一德国的“幻想破灭了”。
    在美国冷战策划者的鼓动下，一心要加速重新武装的西德政府满以为事情会大吉大利了，并且还异想天开地举行了一次民意测验，想借此来为他们加速重新武装的措施壮壮声威。为此，如“西德日报”所指出的，“大部分的西德报纸为了影响居民表示态度”还作了不小的努力。但是，事与愿违，尽管西德当局花了这么大力气，而民意测验的结果却还是给了这些军国主义者一记响亮的耳光。
    在这次被询问的人中，大多数认为苏联军队应匈牙利政府的请求帮助镇压反革命叛乱，是为了和平的利益；苏联没有其他选择的办法。
    在加速进行重新武装的问题上，60％的人都认为目前没有理由要急于重建军队。对于这个数字西德“电讯报”认为是“出乎意外的高”。
    同时有89％的人都谴责波恩政府想与民主德国“割断联系”的计划，并赞成由两个德意志国家政府之间进行接触来统一德国。
    正如匈牙利的反革命叛乱遭到悲惨失败一样，西德军国主义者和美国冷战策划者企图借此煽起西德重新军国主义化情绪的图谋也落空了。西德“新莱因报”在评论这次民意测验的结果时说，它“好像对波恩浇了一瓢冷水”。这个评语显然是很恰当的。不过应当指出，这瓢冷水不只是浇在波恩当局头上的，也是浇在美国冷战策划者头上的。　（生）
