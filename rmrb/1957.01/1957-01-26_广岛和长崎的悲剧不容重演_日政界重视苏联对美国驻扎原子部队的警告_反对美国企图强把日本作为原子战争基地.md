Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 25th: Japan is paying attention to the Soviet Union's warning regarding the U.S. establishing and stationing atomic forces in other countries' territories.

Ikuo Yasui, Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said: "If the United States launches an atomic attack against the Soviet Union, it is expected that the Soviet Union will retaliate against Japan with atomic weapons. Now, the Soviet Union has clearly issued its warning to Japan." He also said that the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs has been demanding a ban on the manufacture, use, and testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs, while strongly opposing the introduction of atomic weapons into Japan. "In order to prevent the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from being repeated, we are determined to continue to oppose the introduction of atomic weapons and further vigorously promote the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs."

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida said that there is currently no fact of providing an atomic war base in Japan. Japan is willing to seek peace in any situation and avoid getting involved in the whirlpool of war, and is willing to continue to appeal to countries around the world. Regarding foreign media reports that the leaders of Japan and the United States will discuss the issue of whether the United States will station atomic forces in Japan in Washington this spring, he said that although there are reports that the Japanese Prime Minister or Foreign Minister will visit the United States in May, there has been no specific consultation with the United States on the visit.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 25th: Local authoritative sources revealed that in the high-level Japan-U.S. talks scheduled to be held in Washington this spring, the United States will raise the issue of stationing atomic task forces in Japan.

At the same time, some U.S. officials have expressed concern that Japanese public opinion is very sensitive to the atomic issue and opposes using Japan as an atomic base for the United States. Therefore, the United States intends to resolve this issue "to the extent that Japan is willing to accept it."

These people pointed out that a year and a half ago, after the news that "Honest John" rockets without atomic warheads were stored in Japan and Okinawa Island was revealed, it caused a fierce opposition in the Japanese Diet, almost causing the collapse of former Prime Minister Hatoyama's government.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 25th: U.S. State Department Press Officer White issued a statement on the 24th, saying that the TASS statement on the U.S. intention to establish and station atomic forces in other countries' territories "did not come as a surprise to the State Department." In the statement, White stated that the United States insists on doing so as part of its "collective defense."

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to a report in the London "Daily Mail" on the 24th, U.S. Sixth Fleet Commander Brown told the newspaper's reporter that a batch of jet bombers will soon be incorporated into the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. These aircraft are based on aircraft carriers and have the range to carry atomic bombs from the Mediterranean to Moscow. The pilots flying these aircraft have been trained in the use of atomic bombs.

The "Daily Mail" believes that these aircraft are part of the "huge military threat hidden behind the Eisenhower Doctrine."

    广岛和长崎的悲剧不容重演
    日政界重视苏联对美国驻扎原子部队的警告
    反对美国企图强把日本作为原子战争基地
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本重视苏联方面就美国在别国领土上建立和驻扎原子部队问题发出的警告。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务局长安井郁说：如果美国对苏联进行了原子攻击，苏联要使用原子武器对日本进行报复，这是已经料想到的事情。现在苏联是明确地向日本提出了它的警告。他又说，禁止原子弹和氢弹运动一直在要求禁止制造、使用和试验原子弹和氢弹，同时强烈反对把原子武器运进日本。为了不使广岛和长崎的悲剧重演，我们决心要继续反对运进原子武器，进一步强有力地推行禁止原子弹和氢弹运动。
    日本内阁官房长官石田博英说，目前在日本并不存在提供原子战争基地这个事实。日本愿意在任何场合下都要和平而避免把自己卷进战争漩涡，并且愿意继续向世界各国进行呼吁。他对外电所传日美两国首脑今年春天将在华盛顿讨论美国是否要在日本驻扎原子部队问题这个消息说，虽然有消息说，日本首相或者外相将在5月访问美国，但是并没有同美方就访问的事进行具体的磋商。
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：当地权威人士透露，在定于今春在华盛顿举行的日美高级会谈中，美国将提出在日本驻扎原子特遣部队的问题。
    同时，有些美国官员表示，他们担心日本舆论对原子问题十分敏感，并且反对把日本用来作美国的原子基地，因此美国打算“在日本愿意接受的程度之内”来解决这个问题。
    这些人指出，一年半以前，当透露出在日本和冲绳岛存放有不带原子弹头的“诚实的约翰”式火箭炮这个消息之后，在日本国会中曾经引起了一阵猛烈反对，几乎使前首相鸠山的政府垮台。
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻发布官怀特24日发表声明说，塔斯社对美国打算在别国领土上建立和驻扎原子部队问题发表的声明“对国务院来说并不来得突然”。怀特在声明里表示，美国坚持要这样做，这是美国“集体防务”的一部分。
    新华社25日讯　据伦敦“每日邮报”24日报道，美国第六舰队司令布朗向这家报纸的记者透露，一批喷气式轰炸机不几天就要编入地中海的美国第六舰队，这批飞机是以航空母舰为基地并且具有装载原子弹从地中海飞到莫斯科的航程，驾驶这种飞机的飞行员受过关于使用原子弹的训练。
    “每日邮报”认为，这批飞机是“艾森豪威尔主义背后隐藏着的巨大的武力威胁”的一部分。
