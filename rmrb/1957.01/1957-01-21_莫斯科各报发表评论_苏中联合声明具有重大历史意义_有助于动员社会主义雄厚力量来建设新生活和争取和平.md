Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 20th. Moscow newspapers today widely commented on the important results of the Sino-Soviet talks.

"Pravda" today published an editorial entitled "The Great Sino-Soviet Alliance is an Important Pillar of World Peace."

The editorial stated that the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement is a document of great political and historical significance. Undoubtedly, it will play a prominent role in further strengthening the fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union and China, and in strengthening the solidarity of the entire socialist camp. This document will help mobilize the socialist's boundless immense power to build a new life and to strive for peace. The Sino-Soviet Joint Statement vividly demonstrates the unwavering determination of the two socialist countries to jointly strive for peace, jointly repel the aggressor's conspiracies, and jointly strengthen their countries – the bastions of peace.

The editorial said that the Soviet Union and China are socialist brother countries. Common goals unite them, and the great idea of ​​struggling for the construction of communism inspires them. The friendship between the people of our two countries, like the friendship between the people of all countries in the socialist camp, is based on complete equality, mutual respect for national interests, and a shared deep concern for the continuous prosperity of each socialist country and the increasing consolidation of the entire socialist camp.

The editorial pointed out that the friendship between the Soviet Union and China is the result of the efforts of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, which hold high the banner of great proletarian internationalism.

The editorial said that the close unity and friendly cooperation between socialist countries is a reliable guarantee for defending the cause of socialism and consolidating world peace. At present, it is of particular importance to further strengthen this unity in the face of the imperialist aggressive groups intensifying their subversive and provocative activities against socialist countries. The Soviet Union and China believe that consolidating and strengthening the unity between socialist countries on the basis of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs is their highest international obligation.

The editorial continued: Facts have proved that any problems in the relations between socialist countries can be completely resolved through sincere consultation and comradely discussion on the basis of unity. The unity of socialist countries in their mutual relations and the independence of each country can be correctly combined!

The editorial said that the Soviet Union and China firmly believe that any provocative actions by the imperialist aggressive forces attempting to undermine socialist countries will be met with the most resolute rebuff, as in Hungary. The clear and firm stance of our Chinese friends on the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion is completely consistent with the Soviet stance. Defending the socialist fruits of free people and opposing the restoration of capitalism and fascism is our sacred international obligation. The People's Republic of China fulfilled this obligation by helping to repel the American aggression against Korea. The Soviet Union also fulfilled this international obligation by assisting the Hungarian working people in crushing the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The editorial continued, the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement calls on all peace-loving people to remain vigilant and be prepared for a long-term and repeated struggle against the conspiracies of aggressive forces. The imperialists are by no means resigned to the bankruptcy of the reactionary conspiracy in Hungary and the failure of the aggression against Egypt. The United States is intensifying its colonial policy in the Middle East, as evidenced by the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Soviet and Chinese governments strongly condemn this policy of the United States and are prepared to "continue to provide the people of all countries in the Middle East with the necessary support to stop aggression and interference against the countries in this region."

The editorial concluded that the unity between the Soviet Union and China is being further strengthened, which greatly promotes the strengthening of the unity of the entire socialist camp. The Soviet Union and China will do their best to strengthen the unity of all socialist countries and unite the efforts of all peace-loving forces and people of all countries to strive for lasting world peace.

The "Izvestia" editorial pointed out that the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué is a document of great political significance, the significance of which extends far beyond the scope of Sino-Soviet relations. The Sino-Soviet talks demonstrated the unity of views and the profound understanding of common tasks between the Soviet Union and China.

The "Labor Daily" editorial wrote: Everyone who has read this document is convinced of its great political significance. This statement reflects all the new things that illustrate the characteristics of relations between socialist countries. The editorial then pointed out that Sino-Soviet friendship has a deep foundation, and friendship between socialist countries is based on equality and mutual respect for national interests. The friendship and fraternal cooperation between the Soviet Union and China have become an integral part of our lives. The joint statement will help to continue to consolidate the unity and strength of the powerful socialist camp. The editorial continued: The talks between the two governments showed a complete consensus of views on fundamental issues of international relations. The Sino-Soviet Joint Statement is another serious blow to the enemy.

"Red Star News" and other central newspapers also published editorials.

    莫斯科各报发表评论
    苏中联合声明具有重大历史意义
    有助于动员社会主义雄厚力量来建设新生活和争取和平
    新华社莫斯科20日电　莫斯科各报今天广泛评论中苏会谈的重要成果。
    “真理报”今天发表了题为“伟大的苏中同盟是世界和平的重要支柱”的社论。
    社论说，苏中联合声明是一个具有重大政治和历史意义的文件。毫无疑问，它将对进一步加强苏中两国的兄弟同盟，对加强整个社会主义阵营的团结起着突出的作用。这个文件将有助于动员社会主义无穷无尽的雄厚力量来建设新生活，来争取和平。苏中联合声明极其生动地证明了两个社会主义国家具有坚定不移的决心来共同争取和平，共同击退侵略者的阴谋，共同加强自己的国家——和平的堡垒。
    社论说，苏联和中国是社会主义兄弟国家。目的的一致把它们团结在一起，为建设共产主义而奋斗的伟大思想鼓舞着它们。我们两国人民之间的友谊，同社会主义阵营各国人民之间的友谊一样，建立在完全平等、互相尊重国家利益的基础上，他们共同深切关心的是：每一个社会主义国家的不断繁荣，整个社会主义阵营的日益巩固。
    社论指出，苏中两国的友谊，是高高举起伟大的无产阶级国际主义的旗帜的苏联共产党和中国共产党努力的成果。
    社论说，社会主义国家间的亲密团结和友好合作是保卫社会主义事业和巩固世界和平的可靠保证。目前，在帝国主义侵略集团对社会主义国家加紧颠覆和挑拨活动的情况下，进一步加强这种团结具有特别重要的意义。苏联和中国认为，在完全平等、尊重领土完整、国家独立和主权以及互不干涉内政的基础上巩固和加强社会主义国家间的团结是自己的最高的国际义务。
    社论接着说：事实证明，社会主义国家相互关系中的任何问题都是完全可以在团结的基础上经过真诚的协商和同志式的讨论求得解决的。社会主义国家在它们相互关系中的团结和每个国家的独立是完全可以正确地结合起来的！
    社论说，苏联和中国坚信，帝国主义侵略势力企图破坏社会主义国家的任何挑衅行为都将会像在匈牙利那样受到最坚决的回击。我们的中国朋友对待匈牙利反革命叛乱事件的明确而坚定的立场同苏联的立场是完全一致的。保卫自由人民的社会主义果实，反对资本主义和法西斯主义复辟，这是我们的神圣的国际义务。中华人民共和国执行了这个义务，它帮助击退了美国对朝鲜的侵略。苏联也执行了这个国际义务，它援助匈牙利劳动人民粉碎了反革命叛乱。
    社论继续说，苏中联合声明号召一切爱好和平的人民保持警惕，并且准备同侵略势力的阴谋进行长期的、反复的斗争。帝国主义者对在匈牙利反动阴谋的破产和侵略埃及的失败是决不甘心的。美国正在中近东地区加紧推行它的殖民政策，所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”就说明了这一点。苏联政府和中国政府强烈谴责美国这种政策并且准备“继续给予中近东各国人民必要的支持，以制止对这个地区国家的侵略和干涉。”
    社论最后说，苏中的团结正在进一步加强，这在很大的程度上促进着整个社会主义阵营团结的加强。苏中两国将尽力加强社会主义各国的团结，联合一切爱好和平力量和各国人民的努力来争取世界持久和平。
    “消息报”的社论指出，苏中联合公报是一个具有重大政治意义的文件，它的意义远远超出苏中两国关系的范围之外。苏中会谈表现了苏中两国的观点一致和对共同任务的深刻理解。
    “劳动报”的社论写道：每一个读过这个文件的人，都确信它的重大的政治意义。在这个声明中反映了所有说明社会主义国家间关系特征的新东西。社论接着指出，苏中友谊有着深厚的基础，社会主义国家间的友谊是建立在平等、互相尊重民族利益的基础上的。苏联和中国的友谊和兄弟合作成了我们生活中不可分割的部分。联合声明将有助于继续巩固强大的社会主义阵营的统一和力量。社论接着说：两国政府的会谈表明了在国际关系的根本问题上观点的完全一致。苏中联合声明是对敌人又一次严重的打击。
    “红星报”和其他中央报纸也都发表了社论。
