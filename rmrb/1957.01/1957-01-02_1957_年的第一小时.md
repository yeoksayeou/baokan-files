    The First Hour of 1957
    Written by a Collective of Xinhua News Agency Reporters
    The bright chimes of 1957 were transmitted by radio broadcast to all parts of the country. In the capital, the first hour of the New Year was filled with victory and happiness.

    At this moment, everywhere there were joyous songs and dances welcoming the New Year. In the Beijing University's New Year's Eve party hall, President Ma Yinchu turned the first page of the 1957 calendar. Teachers and students of more than forty ethnic groups at the Central Institute for Nationalities held hands and cheered in their own languages: "Happy New Year!" Teachers and students of Beijing Normal University and members of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association delegation embraced each other in the midst of shouts of "Long Live Peace!" Hundreds of scientists gathered together, dancing around a brightly lit fir tree. Playwrights and actors raised their glasses and toasted, their faces beaming with confidence as they discussed their ambitions for the New Year.

    The homes of the capital's citizens were filled with happiness and joy. In the large family of Liu Yifeng, vice chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, three generations gathered together to welcome the New Year. The children sang and danced before their elders. Liu Yifeng sat among the children wearing red scarves, chatting and laughing from time to time. Although he was seventy-three years old, he expressed his desire to do more for socialism. In the midst of joy, the whole family discussed cordially how to work and study better in the New Year. Because such opportunities for reunions were rare, Liu Yifeng specially bought many yuanxiao (sweet rice dumplings) for everyone to eat. A happy family brings people infinite hope. Just two minutes into 1957, a little life was born in Beijing Jiaodaokou Hospital, and a flush of happiness appeared on the face of the mother, Zhou Meiyun. This was the third son of Chen Deshan, who has been working in music for more than twenty years, and he wants to train them all to be excellent musicians.

    During this joyful hour, many people in the capital began their work in 1957, and those supporting national construction also received new work assignments and embarked on journeys to distant places.

    Song Yulin, an old foreman who has worked beside the blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant for eighteen years, directed the first shift of production for this year at blast furnace No. 1. At 0:20, he hurried out of the duty room and issued a signal to prepare for tapping the iron. Twenty minutes later, the surging molten iron turned the huge casting bed crimson. After the old foreman's appraisal, the molten iron received the comment "quality qualified." The molten iron continued to flow for half an hour. Song Yulin glanced at the molten iron tank and said with satisfaction, "The first shot has been fired! Fifteen tons more than planned." In the tens of minutes before this furnace of molten iron came out, at 23:45 on December 31, 1956, blast furnace No. 10 tapped the last furnace of iron for the entire plant, and at that moment, the entire plant had produced 19,800 tons of pig iron more for the country in 1956!

    The rural suburbs are also showing a thriving atmosphere, with greenhouses as warm as spring filled with lush greenery. In this midwinter midnight, Li Molin, a famous vegetable growing expert from the Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative, came to the greenhouse with a lamp, carefully checking the thermometer and observing the growth of the vegetables.

    At 0:15, the locomotive's whistle blew loudly at the platform. The train from Beijing to Zhengzhou—the first train departing from the capital in 1957—started moving. The train carried passengers full of confidence as they began their work in 1957, heading towards the construction of the Central Plains. On the train, there were two teams of workers rushing to new construction sites to build new railway lines. A tunnel engineering team that had just arrived from the Northeast had completed a forest railway tunnel project in 1956. In the New Year, they were going to Taiyuan to take on the realignment project of the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi Province, which runs through the coal and iron land. Another tunnel team was going to Henan to start the tunnel project for the double-track line between two new industrial cities—Zhengzhou and Luoyang.

    The bright lights of the train cut through the darkness as it sped across the vast fields. (Attached picture)

    1957年的第一小时
    新华社记者集体采写
    1957年的嘹亮的钟声，由无线电广播传达到全国各地。在首都新年的第一个小时里，生活充满了胜利和幸福。
    这个时刻，到处有迎接新年的欢乐歌舞，在北京大学联欢的大厅里，校长马寅初揭开了1957年日历的第一页。中央民族学院四十多个民族的教师和学生手拉手，用自己民族的语言相互欢呼：“新年好！”北京师范大学的师生和苏联对外文化协会代表团的团员们在和平万岁的声中拥抱在一起。几百个科学工作者欢聚在一起，围着灯光闪烁的枞树，翩翩起舞。剧作家和演员们，举杯共饮，面带笑容信心百倍地谈论着踏上新的一年的抱负。
    首都市民家庭里充满着幸福和欢乐。在北京市工商联副主任委员刘一峰的大家庭里，祖孙三代团聚一起，共迎新年。孩子们在长辈面前歌舞不已。刘一峰坐在系着红领巾的孩子中间，不时地谈笑着。虽然七十三岁了，他还表示要为社会主义多做些事情。全家的人在欢乐中，亲切地商量着在新的一年中，怎样更好地工作和学习。由于这样的团聚机会不多，刘一峰特地为大家买来许多元宵吃。幸福的家庭，给人们带来无限希望。就在1957年刚过两分钟，一个小生命在北京市交道口医院里诞生了，妈妈周美云的脸上泛起幸福的红晕。这是从事音乐工作二十多年的陈德山的第三个儿子，他要把他们都培养成优秀的音乐家。
    在这欢乐的一个小时里，首都有许多人开始了1957年的工作，支援国家建设的人们也领受了新的工作任务，踏上了远方的征途。
    在石景山钢铁厂高炉旁工作了十八年的老工长宋玉林，指挥起一号高炉今年第一班的生产。零点二十分，他急促地走出值班室，发出准备出铁的信号。二十分钟后，滚滚奔腾的铁水把偌大的铸床场映得通红。铁水经过老工长的鉴定，得到了“质量合格”的评语。铁水继续奔流了半小时。宋玉林朝铁水罐望了望，满意地说：“第一炮打响了！比计划多出了十五吨。”在这炉铁水奔出前几十分钟，也就是1956年12月31日二十三点四十五分时，十号高炉出完全厂最后一炉铁，就在那个时候，全厂1956年为国家多生产一万九千八百吨生铁！
    郊区农村一样是欣欣向荣的气象，和暖如春的温室里一片嫩绿。在这隆冬的午夜，四季青蔬菜生产合作社著名种菜能手李墨林提着灯来到温室，仔细检查温度表，观察蔬菜生长的情况。
    零点十五分，站台上机车汽笛长鸣。北京到郑州的列车——1957年从首都出发的第一列火车开动了。列车载着满怀信心开始1957年工作的旅客，奔向建设的中原。列车上，有两支赶赴新工地建设新铁路线的工人。刚从东北来的一支隧道工程队工人，在1956年完成了一条森林铁路的隧道工程，在新年里他们要赶到太原，去接受贯穿煤铁之乡的山西省的同蒲路的改线工程。另一支隧道工人是去河南开始两个新的工业城市——郑州、洛阳间复线的隧道工程。
