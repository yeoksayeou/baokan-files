	Comrade
	Wen Shan
	I carried my backpack, wearing a large straw hat, on the southern coast of the motherland, from this city to that city; from small towns to fishing ports; from mining areas to rural villages. In October, the southern sun was still so hot, my skin gradually turned as bright as bronze; my heart was soaked in the warm friendship of comrades.

	When I was hungry, a comrade personally handed me his own bowl and chopsticks; when I was cold, a comrade covered me with his own blanket; even though it was the first time we met, they gave me their own bed, or set up a temporary bed for me. When I had to leave before dawn, comrades rubbed their eyes, snatched my backpack, held my hand tightly, and saw me onto the bus. In the fields, comrades diligently led the way for me; at the seaport docks, comrades wished they could tell me everything they knew in detail.

	While waiting for the bus at a small station by the highway, a beautiful young couple, sitting on a small bench, were talking and smiling. Seeing me come, they stood up, squeezed out a space, and greeted me, saying, "Comrade, come and sit here!" They were newly married. The man was a sturdy, polite young fellow; the woman, with her curved eyebrows and large, smiling eyes, was a shock worker in a collective farm. They had just gone home to visit their mother. This warm greeting allowed me to share their happiness. Looking at the straight road stretching into the distance, I seemed to see the future of their lives.

	In the village where the young drilling team members lived. At dusk, I returned to the village from the drilling tower, barefoot, walking on the soft and moist edge of the field. Several villagers with hoes on their shoulders walked towards me, looking at me, one old villager said loudly, "This comrade hasn't been seen before, a new one, right?" "That's right, I didn't see him a few days ago!" They went far away, and I could still hear them discussing. They weren't speaking to me, but they were also speaking to me; this is a special way of greeting used by the simple farmers in this area. They won't run over and shake hands and chat with you, but they care about you, care about the new comrade. As long as you are a comrade, you can always count on their loyal heart and their large, rough hands for help. I know such people. Don't think this is just a casual greeting from a passerby, look at the honest smiles on their faces, the expression in their eyes, how much they care about you!

	I went around the low bushes at the edge of the village, and heard squeaky voices behind me calling, "Comrade! Comrade!" It turned out to be a few little guys, some wearing their father's clothes, bareheaded, barefoot, smiling so hard they squinted, following behind me. I asked them what they wanted? But they just smiled happily, calling "Comrade!" "Comrade!" repeatedly so affectionately. I walked forward, and they walked forward too. I stopped and looked back at their amusing appearances, and they also stopped and looked at me and smiled. Little things! Although you don't understand how the word "Comrade" is defined in the dictionary, your warm calls have enriched the meaning of these two words!

	In what era has the relationship between people been as close as it is now? In what place could you so trust someone you've met for the first time? It's truly "chance encounter," often not even knowing each other's names, but being so kind, not needing to worry at all that we will part forever in a little while, never to meet again.

	I will always remember you, comrade I met on the coast! I will always remember your face, dyed reddish-brown by the sea breeze, seawater, and the sun on the sea, your pair of boxer's arms and fists, the leather briefcase slung over your shoulder (with a snow-white towel tied next to it). You seemed so experienced, and handsome, as if the sea itself had shaped your character, you shared its boldness. We met on the way, and also parted on the way, but your shadow has been carved into my memory. You got off the bus at a small town by the highway, we shook hands vigorously, but we didn't say goodbye, because we knew there was no possibility of seeing each other again, and the motherland is so vast. You said loudly, "I'm leaving!" turned around, and waved. I watched your broad back, your white shirt disappear in the longan tree forest...

	From now on, we will no longer use "stranger" to describe those we don't know, our lives have changed the proverbs we have used for thousands of years. I sincerely thank you, dear comrades! Returning from afar, I not only understand a little more than before what is meant by comrade, but my heart also feels joy from time to time—because it is soaked in the warm friendship of comrades. 1956, 12, 10, Beijing

    我背着背囊，戴着大草帽，在祖国的南海边，从这个城市，到那个城市；从小镇，到渔港；从矿区，到农村。10月里，南国的太阳还是那么的热，我的皮肤渐渐变得像古铜那样发亮；我的心，浸透了同志的温暖的友谊。
    我饿了，同志亲手递给我他自己的碗筷；我冷了，同志给我盖上他自己的毛毡；只是第一次见面，他们就把自己的床铺让给我，或者为我架起临时的床。天未亮就要起程，同志们擦着眼睛，抢过我的背囊，紧紧拉着我的手，送我上车。在田野里，同志殷勤地为我带路；在海港码头上，同志恨不得把他全部知道的事，都为我细细地讲。
    在公路旁的小车站等汽车，一对漂亮的年青的夫妇，坐在一条小板凳上，正笑眯眯地谈话。看见我来，就站起来挤出了一个位子，招呼我说：“同志，来这儿坐！”他们刚结了婚。男的，是个结实、有礼貌的小伙子；女的，弯弯的长眉毛，满含笑意的大眼睛，是集体农庄里的突击队员。他们刚刚回家看过妈妈。这亲热的招呼，使我分尝了他们的幸福。对着面前笔直地向远方伸展的大路，我好像看到了他们生命的前程。
    在青年钻机队员们住的村子。黄昏时，我从钻塔回村，赤着脚，走在又软又润湿的田边小路上。几个老乡肩着锄头迎面走来，望着我，一个老乡大声地说：“这位同志还没见过哩，新来的吧？”“可不是，前两天还没看见呢！”他们去远了，我还听见他们在议论。他们不是讲给我听，但也是讲给我听；这是这一带朴实的农民们特殊的问候方式。他们不会跑过来和你握手拉谈，但他们关心你，关心新来的同志。只要你是同志，你就随时可以指望得到他们那颗忠厚的心，那双粗大的手的帮助。我知道这样的人。千万不要以为这是过路人随便的一声招呼，你看他们老实的脸上的笑容，眼里的神情，是多么地关心你！
    我绕进了村边矮矮的灌木林，听到背后吱吱喳喳地叫：“同志！同志！”原来是几个小家伙，有的穿着他爸爸的衣裳，光着脑袋，赤着脚，笑得眯了眼，跟在我后面。我问他们有什么事？他们却只是高兴地笑着，一连气地叫着“同志！”“同志！”叫得那么亲热。我往前走，他们也往前走。我站住回过头来看他们那好玩的模样儿，他们也就站住看着我笑。小东西们呵！你们虽然不懂得辞典上“同志”这两个字怎样解释，可是你们亲热的喊声，却丰富了这两个字的涵义！
    在哪一个时代，人和人的关系像现在那么亲密过？有过哪一个地方，你可以这样地信赖生平第一次遇到的人？真是“萍水相逢”，常常连姓名都不知道，但却那么亲切，根本用不着理会，等一会儿我们就永远分手，从此再不相见。
    我将永远地记住你，相遇在海滨的同志！我永远记住你那被海风、海水、海上的太阳染成了赭褐色的脸，你那一双拳击家的手臂和拳头，那肩上斜挂着的公文皮匣（旁边还拴着一条雪白的毛巾）。你显得那么老练，而且英俊，似乎是海亲手塑成了你的性格，你分有了他的豪爽。我们相见在途中，也就在途中离别，但你的影子已雕进了我的记忆。在公路旁的一个小镇上，你下车了，我们用力地握一握手，但我们不说再见，因为我们知道再见没有可能，而祖国是那么辽阔。你大声地说：“我走了！”回过头来，挥挥手。我看着你宽阔的背影、你的白衬衫在龙眼树林中消失。……
    从今后，我们不再用“路人”来形容陌生，我们的生活，已经改变了我们几千年来惯用的谚语。我诚恳地感谢你们，亲爱的同志！从远方归来，我不只比过去稍为懂得了什么叫做同志，我的心，还时时感到欢喜——因为它浸透了同志的温暖的友谊。1956，12，10，北京
