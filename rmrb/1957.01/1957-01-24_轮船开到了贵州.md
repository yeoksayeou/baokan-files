Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the evening of the 14th, a brand-new shallow-water tugboat sailed from Hejiang County, Sichuan Province, along the Chishui River and arrived in Chishui County, Guizhou Province, on its trial voyage. This is the first time a steamboat has appeared on a river in Guizhou Province. Once officially open to navigation, transporting goods from Chishui County to Chongqing will only take a little over a day, one or two times faster than by wooden boat.

    轮船开到了贵州
    据新华社讯　14日傍晚，一艘崭新的浅水拖轮从四川省合江县沿赤水河试航来到贵州省赤水县。贵州省的河流上第一次出现了轮船。待正式通航以后，从赤水县起运物资到重庆，只需一天多，比木船快一两倍。
