    To Exchange Experience in Bumper Harvests
    Last year, the Baoshan Agricultural Cooperative in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, increased its production, and the income of the members generally increased by more than two times. In addition to completing the original task of handing over public grain and selling surplus grain, this cooperative will sell 800,000 jin of grain to the state. They are actively working to strive for more production increases this year. With the help of the township agricultural technology extension station, the cooperative has established an agricultural product exhibition room to exchange experience in bumper harvests with fraternal cooperatives. This is a picture of the members organizing the exhibited agricultural products. Photo by Yu Min (Manuscript from Heilongjiang Daily)

    为了交流丰产经验
    黑龙江省绥化县宝山农业社去年增产了，社员普遍增加了两倍多的收入。这个社除完成原定交公粮和卖余粮的任务以外，还要多卖给国家八十万斤粮食。他们正在积极努力争取今年更多增产。在乡农业技术推广站的帮助下，这个社建立了一个农产品展览室，以便同各兄弟社交流丰产经验。这是社员们在整理展览的农产品。　于敏摄（黑龙江日报社稿）
