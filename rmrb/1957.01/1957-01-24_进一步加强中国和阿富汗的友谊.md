    Editorial: Further Strengthen the Friendship Between China and Afghanistan
    After concluding their visits to fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and Hungary, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long of our country arrived in our western neighbor, the Kingdom of Afghanistan, from January 19th to 24th for a five-day friendly visit at the invitation of the Kingdom. Premier Zhou Enlai and others were warmly welcomed by the government and people of all circles of the Kingdom of Afghanistan. During the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai and Afghan Prime Minister Daud Khan exchanged views cordially on issues directly related to the two countries and issues of international concern, and issued a joint communique between China and Afghanistan. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit is of great significance for further developing the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Afghanistan.
    China and Afghanistan are both ancient countries in Asia. Many centuries ago, close cultural and trade ties and friendly neighborly relations were established between our two countries. There has never been hostility or animosity between our two countries, let alone war or conflict. History records the traditional friendship and close exchanges between the people of the two countries. In the past century, both of our countries have suffered from colonialist aggression and oppression. However, just as the high mountains of the Pamirs could not prevent the exchanges of our ancestors, colonialists could not hinder the friendship between the people of our two countries for long. After the people of the two countries respectively freed themselves from colonial rule and achieved independence, the traditional friendly relations between China and Afghanistan were restored and developed on a new basis. At the Bandung Conference, the leaders of the two governments had direct contact. Last year, there were mutual visits of Afghan cultural delegations and Chinese art delegations. At the same time, our country was invited to send an exhibition group to participate in the exhibition at the Afghan Independence Day Industrial Exposition held in Kabul. In order to further develop trade relations between the two countries, the governments of the two countries have started negotiations on trade agreements and payment agreements in recent months. All of these have made the friendly relations between our two countries grow day by day. Now, we are pleased to see that the leaders of the two governments have expressed in the joint communique their common desire to further strengthen the friendly ties between the two countries on the basis of good-neighborly relations.
    China and Afghanistan are both participants in the Bandung Conference and implementers of the Bandung resolutions. Today, just as Western colonialists, regardless of the unanimous condemnation of the Asian and African people, are attempting to expand their aggression against the Middle East, the Prime Ministers of the two countries reiterated in the joint communique their support for the principles of the Bandung Conference and their support for the cause of the Asian and African people in maintaining freedom and independence and promoting peace and cooperation, which will undoubtedly bring beneficial effects to the situation in Asia and Africa.
    The Sino-Afghan Joint Communique reiterates Prime Minister Daud Khan's acceptance of Premier Zhou Enlai's previous invitation to visit our country for a friendly visit this year. The Chinese people sincerely welcome Prime Minister Daud Khan's visit. We believe that in the increasingly frequent exchanges between the leaders and people of the two governments, the cause of Sino-Afghan friendly cooperation will surely be continuously promoted.

    进一步加强中国和阿富汗的友谊
    我国总理周恩来、副总理贺龙等结束了在苏联、波兰、匈牙利等兄弟国家访问之后，于本月19日到24日应邀到达我国的西部邻邦阿富汗王国进行五天的友好访问。周恩来总理等受到阿富汗王国政府和各界人民的热烈欢迎。在访问期间，周恩来总理和阿富汗达乌德汗首相就两国直接有关的问题和国际上关心的问题亲切地交换了意见，并发表了中阿两国联合公报。周恩来总理的这次访问，对进一步发展中阿两国人民的友好合作具有重要的意义。
    中国和阿富汗都是亚洲古老的国家。许多世纪以前，我们两国间就建立了密切的文化、贸易联系和友善的睦邻关系。在我们两国间从来没有敌对和恶感，更没有战争和冲突，历史上记载的是两国人民传统的友谊和亲密的交往。近百年来，我们两国都曾遭到殖民主义的侵略和压迫。但是，正像帕米尔的高山峻岭不能阻隔我们的祖先的来往一样，殖民主义者也不能长期妨碍我们两国人民间的友谊。在两国人民分别摆脱了殖民统治和取得了独立之后，中阿两国传统的友好关系又在新的基础上得到了恢复和发展。在万隆会议上两国政府领导人曾进行了直接接触。去年间，又有阿富汗文化代表团和我国艺术代表团的互相访问。同时，我国应邀派遣了展览团参加在喀布尔举行的阿富汗独立日工业博览会的展出。为了进一步发展两国的贸易关系，两国政府间在最近几个月来开始了贸易协定和支付协定的谈判。所有这些都使我们两国的友好关系与日俱增。现在，我们高兴地看到，两国政府的领导人在联合公报中表达了我们将在善邻关系的基础上进一步加强两国友好联系的共同愿望。
    中国和阿富汗都是万隆会议的参加者和万隆决议的执行者。今天，正当西方殖民者不顾亚非人民的同声谴责企图扩大对中东侵略的时候，两国总理和首相在联合公报中重申他们支持万隆会议的原则，支持亚非人民维护自由和独立、促进和平和合作的事业，这对于亚非局势无疑地将带来有益的影响。
    中阿联合公报中重申达乌德汗首相应周恩来总理以前的邀请，将于今年内来我国进行友好访问。中国人民对达乌德汗首相的访问，竭诚表示欢迎。我们相信：在两国政府领导人和人民日益频繁的交往中，一定会把中阿友好合作的事业不断地推向前进。
