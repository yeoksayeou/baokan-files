Xinhua News Agency, 19th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the 18th to continue discussing the issue of Israel's withdrawal from Egypt.

	Afghan representative Aziz appealed to all member states of the Assembly to approve the proposal of the twenty-five Asian-African countries and to work together to implement it.

	Saudi Arabian representative Dejani accused Israel of pursuing a policy of "creeping annexation." He pointed out that recognizing any Israeli claims regarding the Gaza Strip or the Gulf of Aqaba would mean that Israelis could benefit from their aggression against Egypt.

	Indian representative Menon said that his delegation believed that Israel was unwilling to withdraw in accordance with the UN's demands. The twenty-five-nation proposal requesting Israel's complete withdrawal from Egypt recommends that Hammarskjöld submit a report on the situation in five days. This should automatically convene the Assembly in five days to consider developments.

	Menon said that Hammarskjöld, in his recent report on the Middle East, indicated that the UN Emergency Force might play an expanded role as a "conciliator" in the region, and some other countries have said more about this. Menon said, "We want to state here that any changes in the powers of the UN Emergency Force require consultation with all relevant countries," and "India will never support the proposition of turning the UN Emergency Force into an occupation army."

	Representatives from Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Nepal, Liberia, and Greece, among others, expressed their support for the twenty-five-nation proposal in their speeches.

	British representative Noble reiterated the views of some Western countries that the Gaza Strip should be "internationalized" after Israel's withdrawal. He said that Britain believes that some issues that "require urgent attention" will remain after the withdrawal of Israeli troops. By insisting on the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the United Nations inevitably bears the "responsibility for resolving these issues." He said that regarding the Gulf of Aqaba and the Straits of Tiran, Britain "will support any acceptable form of 'internationalization'."

	Yugoslav representative Brilej opposed mixing the issue of Israel's withdrawal with other issues in the Middle East. He pointed out that Israeli troops must withdraw unconditionally and without further delay. Only after this is done can the Assembly discuss other issues related to the Middle East.

	Ukrainian representative Zabigailo said that Israel, in order to find a justification for its attack on Egypt, repeated the long-debunked myth that Egypt continued to launch attacks on Israeli territory. But the fact is that there are no Egyptian soldiers on Israeli territory, but there are Israeli soldiers on Egyptian territory. He said that although Israel has promised to withdraw its troops, we have never heard a date for when the withdrawal will be completed. The United Nations should take steps to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egypt.

	Zabigailo said that the US government is currently trying to intensify the establishment of US dominance over the Middle East. If the Eisenhower Plan is implemented, it will mean formal approval of armed intervention in the affairs of sovereign Arab countries in the Middle East. What the US government is asking for is prior approval for the US to carry out an action that Britain and France did months ago and which was severely condemned by public opinion.

	Zabigailo said that we cannot tolerate a situation that makes the Middle East a region of constant bloodshed. The main cause of the tension there should be eliminated. This main cause is the intervention of imperialist countries.

	Representatives from Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Poland also demanded the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops.

	The meeting finally decided to continue discussions on the 19th.

    许多国家在联大支持亚非国家提案
    坚持以色列部队必须全部撤出埃及领土
    印度代表反对使联合国部队成为占领军
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会18日举行全体会议，继续讨论以色列从埃及撤军问题。
    阿富汗代表阿齐兹号召大会的全体会员国批准二十五个亚非国家的提案并且齐心协力地把它付诸实施。
    沙特阿拉伯代表德贾尼指责以色列奉行“得寸进尺”的政策。他指出，承认以色列关于加沙地带或亚喀巴湾的任何要求就意味着以色列人可以从进攻埃及中得到好处。
    印度代表梅农说，他的代表团认为以色列不愿意按照联合国的要求撤退。二十五国提出的要求以色列完全撤出埃及的提案建议哈马舍尔德在五天后就这个局势提出报告。这应该使大会在五天后自动开会以考虑发展情况。
    梅农说，哈马舍尔德在他最近关于中东的报告中表明联合国紧急部队不妨在这个地区起“和事老”的扩大的职能，其他一些国家还说了更多的关于这方面的话。梅农说，“我们现在要在这里说明，联合国紧急部队的职权的任何变动都需要一切有关国家进行磋商”，“印度决不会支持使联合国紧急部队成为一支占领军的主张”。
    印度尼西亚、泰国、巴基斯坦、尼泊尔、利比里亚和希腊等国代表在发言中表示支持二十五国提案。
    英国代表诺布耳重申西方一些国家的观点，就是在以色列撤军以后，加沙地区应该“国际化”。他说，英国认为，以色列部队撤退以后将留下某些“需要迫切注意”的问题。联合国由于坚持以色列部队的撤退，必然负有“解决这些问题的责任”。他说，关于亚喀巴湾和蒂朗海峡，英国“将支持任何可以接受的“国际化形式”。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊反对把以色列撤军问题和中东地区的其他问题混在一起。他指出，以色列部队必须无条件撤出，并且不容再拖延下去，只有把这件事办好以后，才能由大会讨论有关中东的其他问题。
    乌克兰代表扎比加伊洛说，以色列为了替自己进攻埃及找寻理由而重复了早经破了产的神话，说什么埃及方面对以色列领土继续进行袭击。但是事实是：以色列领土上没有什么埃及士兵，倒是有以色列的士兵在埃及的领土上。他说，以色列虽然答应撤兵，但是，关于撤兵要在何时完成，我们从来没有听到过一个日期。联合国应该采取步骤，使以色列军队全部从埃及撤出。
    扎比加伊洛说，美国政府目前正在努力加紧建立美国对中东的统治。如果艾森豪威尔计划得以实施，这将意味着正式批准武装干涉中东阿拉伯主权国家的事务。美国政府所要求的是要预先批准美国去进行一种行动，这种行动是英国和法国几个月以前曾经干过的，而且受到舆论的非常严厉的谴责。
    扎比加伊洛说，我们不能容忍使中东成为不断流血的地区的局势。那儿紧张局势的主要原因应该消除。这个主要原因就是帝国主义国家的干涉。
    白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和波兰等国代表也要求以色列军队全部撤出。
    会议最后决定在19日继续进行讨论。
