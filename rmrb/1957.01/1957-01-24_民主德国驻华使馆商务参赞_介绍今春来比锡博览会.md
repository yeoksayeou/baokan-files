Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: Norbert, Commercial Counselor of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, said today that approximately forty countries will participate in the Leipzig Spring Fair, which will be held from March 3rd to 14th, 1957.

Norbert said that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will exhibit their complete export catalogs at the fair. The Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia will participate in the exhibition with an official collective display for the first time since the war. The fair provides favorable opportunities for developing import and export trade under the trade agreement between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China.

Norbert said that many countries in the East and many countries in Europe will participate in the collective exhibition in an official capacity at this fair. He said that the Leipzig Fair attracts representatives from different economic systems to jointly study East-West trade. It has become a medium for signing trade contracts, and no other institution can communicate international material exchanges like it. Norbert pointed out that the Leipzig Fair proves with facts that peaceful coexistence and trade communication between countries with different economic and social systems are possible and necessary. There is every reason to say that the Leipzig Fair is a symbol of peaceful coexistence.
