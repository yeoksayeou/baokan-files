In the editorial department of the Hebei Daily, I saw a reader's letter stating that the experience of the cadres of the Xiying Agricultural Cooperative in Wen'an County after running the cooperative for a year was: "Cooperatives are not as good as working individually." The branch secretary of this cooperative even cited several examples to prove his point: In August, when the rivers rose, the branch and the cooperative management committee mobilized people to rush to harvest, but the members did not move. Later, the cooperative management committee issued an order: "Whoever rushes to harvest, gets it." As a result, men, women, young and old all went to the fields, forming a "rush to harvest" climax. After the rush to harvest, the cadres of this cooperative believed that "advanced cooperatives cannot exert their superiority in overcoming famine," and even called on members to go their separate ways, causing the cooperative to fall into a state of disintegration.

Today, there are not many people who truly doubt the superiority of the cooperative system; however, in the rural areas of Hebei, some confused ideas caused by natural disasters and some errors in work have increased the seriousness of this issue. These confused ideas urgently need to be clarified.

In 1956, Hebei suffered a particularly severe flood, which was rare in history, resulting in a decrease in production compared to 1955. In 1955, the total grain output of the province was 18.2 billion jin, while in 1956, the province harvested approximately 16.5 billion jin, a decrease of 1.7 billion jin. However, the disaster area in 1955 was very small, with over 14 million mu of land flooded, less than 11% of the total cultivated land area of 130 million mu; while in 1956, over 45 million mu of land were flooded, almost 35% of the total cultivated land area. This means that the disaster area in 1956 was 24% larger than in 1955, while the grain reduction was only 9.3% less than in 1955. The area affected by the disaster increased significantly, while the proportion of grain reduction was small, which relatively indicates that grain production in areas not affected by the disaster had increased. This is indeed the case. According to materials from the Rural Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, based on statistics from 16,014 cooperatives in 106 counties and 6 cities in the 8 special districts of Zhangjiakou, Tongxian, Tianjin, Tangshan, Xingtai, Handan, Chengde, and Baoding, 5,723 cooperatives increased production in 1956, accounting for 35.8% of the total; 945 cooperatives maintained production, accounting for 5.9%; 8,750 cooperatives reduced production due to natural disasters, accounting for 54.6%; and 596 cooperatives reduced production due to poor management, accounting for 3.7%. This shows that the main reason for the reduction in production was natural disasters. All cooperatives that were not affected by natural disasters increased production in most cases, and only a few cooperatives reduced production due to poor management.

Here are two more examples:

Taihewa in Ji County is an area that suffers from floods nine years out of ten. Before liberation, all 121 villages in the area were often flooded, and the people had no food or clothing. Every autumn, men went out to make a living, and even entire families fled and begged everywhere. After liberation, although people's lives have become relatively stable due to government leadership and relief efforts, harvests were still small due to the weakness of the individual economy. In 1954, a major flood occurred, and only 5.16 million jin of autumn grain were harvested from 210,000 mu of land. In 1956, advanced cooperativization was realized, and dozens of inter-village and inter-township cooperatives were formed, which provided the conditions for joint water management and successfully solved the problem of production reform, effectively resisting water disasters. In the past, people were accustomed to planting reeds and sorghum in lower-lying areas and wheat and beans in higher areas, with very little rice planting. After the establishment of advanced cooperatives, soil and water conservation was implemented in the mountainous areas, and 23 spider-web-like dikes were built in the low-lying areas to store the water entering the low-lying areas section by section, preventing water accumulation and disasters. Then, rice was planted on a large scale within the dikes, turning water disasters into water conservancy. Although the flood in 1956 was larger than in 1954, the harvest greatly exceeded that of 1954. A total of 15.63 million jin of autumn grain were harvested, three times that of 1954, and 8.1 million jin were harvested from 45,000 mu of japonica rice alone.

In the deep mountainous area of Xingtai, there is the Shicao Village Agricultural Cooperative. This area has vast land but very little cultivated land, with each person having only one mu of land; the mountains are also bare. Of the 160 households in the village, only a dozen landlords, rich peasants, and upper-middle peasants had enough to eat before liberation. Most farmers lived in poverty, and 30 to 40 people went out to beg every year. At that time, the average yield per mu was only about 100 jin for both irrigated and dry land. After the Eighth Route Army arrived in 1938, rent and interest reduction were implemented, followed by land reform and the organization of mutual aid, which increased land yield to about 200 jin; in 1954, preliminary cooperatives were organized, and local planting was started, with an average grain yield of 375 jin per mu and a total output of 179,000 jin; in 1955, in order to expand the cultivated land area and cultivate fruit trees, the entire village used collective strength to build embankments (stone-built borders) and terraces, which were carefully cultivated, bringing the village's total grain output to more than 280,000 jin, with an average of 550 jin per mu; last year, it was converted into advanced cooperatives, and all land was completely unified management, high-yield crops were promoted, and technical reforms were implemented. The average yield per mu in the village reached 700 jin, with a total output of 350,000 jin. Grain production doubled in three years. In addition, the cooperative also cultivated a large number of trees and fruit trees, having cultivated more than 3,000 mu in three years, reaching 4,000 mu including the past. In ten years, the income from trees will far exceed that from agriculture.

From countless such examples, the superiority of the cooperative system can be seen: First, because the boundaries of land are eliminated and operations are unified, it is possible to concentrate efforts to transform the land and implement production reforms. Obviously, without advanced cooperativization, the method of transforming the low-lying areas in Taihewa would not be possible. Not to mention anything else, who would bear the many lands lost due to the construction of dikes in the era of the individual economy? Second, the implementation of collective labor and remuneration according to labor greatly liberated the labor force. On the one hand, everyone is willing to work more and get more pay, so the advanced cooperatives generally spend more on land processing than the primary cooperatives (for example, last year, the Shicao Village Cooperative averaged more than three additional workdays per mu of land than the previous year, which made it possible to cultivate more intensively); on the other hand, collective labor has produced a kind of "combined force" that cannot be achieved by individual strength, such as the need to transport many huge stones when building terraces and embankments in the Shicao Village Cooperative, some weighing dozens of jin and some weighing thousands of jin, which would be difficult to do without the collective cooperation of most people. Third, precisely because of the unified cooperative management, it is possible to fully utilize everyone's strengths to specialize in certain businesses, such as planting, raising livestock, sidelines, and cultivating trees. In particular, the establishment of certain specialized technical organizations has played a greater role in developing production. Fourth, is the centralization of financial resources (mainly means of production). Obviously, without advanced cooperatives concentrating everyone's means of production and using the investment of the masses, it would not be possible to carry out such a huge production and construction undertaking in Taihewa.

Marx pointed out the weaknesses of individual farmers and their small plots of land in "The Class Struggles in France" saying that those so-called "free landowners," "under the system of small plots of land, the land is entirely a means of production for the farmers. But the rate of output of the land decreases as the degree to which the land is cut up increases. The use of machines to cultivate the land, the division of labor, large-scale soil improvement measures, such as the digging of drainage ditches and irrigation ditches, all become increasingly impossible to implement, while the redundancy fees for cultivating the land increase in proportion to the extent to which the means of production itself is cut up..." The historical facts of our China fully prove this point. The cooperative system overcomes the above-mentioned shortcomings.

Some agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province have increased production but not increased income, and some cooperatives have only some people increasing income, while others do not increase income or even decrease income. According to the classification statistics of 1,162 cooperatives in Tongxian Special District, only 77.88% of the households in the production-increasing cooperatives increased their income, which means that 22.12% of the households did not increase their income. Can this be said to be the fault of the cooperative system? No. According to analysis, there are many reasons for the reduced income of these members; these reasons are all related to shortcomings in the work, and not related to the agricultural cooperative system. First, when agricultural cooperatives were first organized last spring, many places only concentrated on agricultural production and neglected sideline occupations and other forestry and animal husbandry production. Historically, Hebei farmers have relied on a lot of income from sideline occupations. In 1955, income from sideline occupations accounted for 21% of the total income from agriculture and sidelines, and the proportion of other forestry and animal husbandry was also not small. The result of losing and neglecting sideline occupations, forestry and animal husbandry is that although grain and cotton production has increased, the total income cannot but decrease. In addition, there are many cooperatives that attach importance to agriculture and also develop diversified economies, which greatly increases income. For example, in Shengfang Town, Ba County, there are 21 agricultural cooperatives, which have earned more than 700,000 yuan from weaving mats and fishing in the two months from February to April last year due to the simultaneous development of agriculture and sideline occupations, which, in addition to meeting the daily needs of farmers, has also strongly supported agriculture. For example, buying pesticides, fertilizers, and power machinery. These all show that the reduction in income is a management problem rather than a system problem. Second, financial expenses are too high. This is related to the fact that the production targets set last spring were too high and the operating principles were not clear. Some cooperatives have excessive expenses and high costs, resulting in increased production but not increased income, which is obviously a management problem. The third is the economic imbalance between villages in the joint-village cooperative. In the past, some villages had more land and fertile land, used less labor and had high income, while some villages had less land and thinner land, used more labor and had less income. After the villages were combined, as a result of not much increase in production and average distribution, the poor villages with less income suddenly increased a lot of income, and the rich villages had to reduce their income. Therefore, in many places, it has created contradictions between villages within the cooperative. This is mainly a problem of the scale of the cooperative, not a problem of the cooperative system. The problem will no longer exist if it is appropriately reduced or reasonably resolved during distribution.

Some people say, "Agricultural cooperatives are only superior in normal times, and are not superior in times of famine." This statement is even more wrong. Last year, Hebei suffered a major flood, along with other disasters such as wind, hail, and insects, with more than 100 counties in the province affected by the disaster. Thanks to the realization of advanced cooperativization, the general ability to resist disasters has been greatly strengthened. For example, the Dongwang Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai, facing the Qili River, has its land washed away every year when floods break out. Last year, in June and July, there were continuous rains, and the cooperative actively prepared for flood prevention, dividing the strong members into six teams and sleeping together. In early August, when the flood arrived, all members of the cooperative came out together, with the strong building dikes and embankments in the front, and women and the elderly transporting mud and grass in the back. The embankment was raised one foot as the water rose one foot, day and night without stopping, and finally overcame the flood. Many nearby villages suffered from water damage because they did not prepare early, but most of the crops in this cooperative were protected, resulting in an average harvest of 180 jin of autumn grain per mu. Many people said that without advanced cooperatives, it would not have been possible to overcome the flood.

In self-rescue from production, advanced cooperatives have shown a special role. After the outbreak of the flood, I visited Zhuoxian and Gaoyang. Although the crops in these places were washed away, the emotions of the masses were very stable. The reason is that, on the one hand, the masses know that the Communist Party will not let people starve to death, and on the other hand, the cooperative actively organized everyone to overcome the famine, and formulated plans for repairing houses, rushing to harvest, and sideline production. The masses felt that there was something to rely on, so their confidence was very high. According to the latest statistics from the seven disaster-stricken special districts in Hebei, as of mid-December, the income from sideline production organized by the government and cooperatives alone has reached 113 million yuan. In 1954, Hebei also suffered a major flood, flooding 40 million mu of land and affecting more than 10 million disaster victims. At that time, because many cooperatives were primary cooperatives and there were still many individual households, sideline production was not as good as last year. According to statistics, from August 1954 after the disaster to the end of May 1955, a total of 146 million yuan was earned in the disaster area in ten months, with an average of 14.6 million yuan per month; while last year, more than 100 million yuan was earned in only four months, with an average of 28 million yuan per month. This fully illustrates the superiority of advanced cooperatives in the struggle against disasters.

As far as I know, cooperatives that do a good job after the disaster generally do not have much problem; only those cooperatives that do not actively think of ways and do not organize members to fight the famine have more chaotic thoughts among the members. The state of disintegration presented by the Xiying Agricultural Cooperative in the face of the disaster precisely illustrates that the cadres of this cooperative were passive and disappointed and did not actively take effective measures to lead the masses. Letting go of superior conditions and not using them, but instead saying that advanced cooperatives have no superiority in overcoming famine. Isn't this nonsense?

Doubting the superiority of cooperatives, and even openly proposing that individual work is better than cooperatives, has its class factors at its root. When cooperatives were formed last year, some relatively wealthy farmers were swept in by the storm. The production level of the newly established cooperatives is not easy to improve quickly, so their income is generally difficult to increase significantly, and some even have to reduce their income. Many cooperatives that reduce their income are mainly these wealthy households. Therefore, they are dissatisfied with cooperatives, doubt the superiority of cooperatives, and say bad things about cooperatives, and some people who have not clarified the situation also follow suit. The result of allowing this kind of thinking to develop will be to disintegrate cooperatives and take the capitalist road.

We must refute fallacies such as "advanced cooperatives are not superior" and "cooperatives are not as good as individual work." Now Hebei has launched a large-scale political propaganda movement to educate cadres and farmers, so that they resolutely take the road of cooperativization and consolidate the socialist position in the countryside.

    高级社在抗灾中放出灿烂的光辉
    本报记者　贺笠
    在河北日报编辑部，我看到一份读者来稿，说文安县西营农业社干部办社一年的体会是：“合作社不如单干强。”这个社的支部书记还举了几个例子来证明自己的观点：8月间各河涨水，支部和社管委会动员抢秋，社员不动，后来社管委会发布了一道命令：“谁抢谁要。”结果，男女老少一齐下地，形成一个“抢秋高潮”。在抢秋以后，这社干部又认为“高级社在渡荒中不能发挥优越性”，竟至号召社员各奔前程，使合作社陷于瓦解状态。
    今天，真正怀疑合作社制度优越性的人并不很多；但是在河北农村中，由于天灾和工作中的一些错误所引起的某些混乱思想，就增加了这个问题的严重性。这种混乱思想，急需加以澄清。
    1956年，河北由于遭受了历年来少有的一次特大洪水，比起1955年是减产了。1955年全省粮食产量共计一百八十二亿斤，1956年全省共收粮食约为一百六十五亿斤，减少了十七亿斤。但是，1955年受灾面积很小，被淹土地一千四百多万亩，不足总耕地面积一亿三千万亩的11％；而1956年所淹土地是四千五百多万亩，几乎占总耕地面积的35％。这就是说，1956年受灾面积比1955年多了24％，而粮食只比1955年减少9.3％。受灾的面积增加了很多，而粮食减产的比例却很小，这就相对地说明，不受灾的地区粮食是有所增加的。事实也正是如此。据河北省委农村工作部的材料，据张家口、通县、天津、唐山、邢台、邯郸、承德、保定八个专区一百零六个县和六个市一万六千零十四个社的统计，1956年增产社五千七百二十三个，占总数的35.8％；保产社九百四十五个，占5.9％；因受天灾而减产的社八千七百五十个，占54.6％；因经营不善而减产的五百九十六个社，占3.7％。这说明了减产的主要原因是天灾。凡不受天灾的，绝大部分社都增产了，只有很少的社才是因为经营不善而减产。
    这里再举两个例子：
    蓟县太河洼是一个十年九涝的地区，解放前全洼一百二十一个村子常被洪水淹没，群众无衣无食，每到秋后，男人多出外谋生，甚至全家流亡，到处乞讨。解放以后，由于政府的领导和救济，人民生活虽已比较稳定，但因个体经济力量微弱，收成仍然很少。1954年水大，全洼二十一万亩土地，秋粮只收了五百一十六万斤。1956年实现了高级合作化，全洼组成几十个联村联乡社，有了共同治水的条件，顺利地解决了生产改革问题，有力地抗御了水害。过去群众习惯在较低洼的地方种苇子、高粱，较高的地方种麦子和豆类，种稻子的很少。成立高级社以后，一方面在山区实行水土保持，另外在洼内修筑二十三道蛛网格堤，使侵入洼内的水节节存蓄，不致积水成灾，然后在格堤内大量种稻子，这样把水患变成了水利。1956年洪水比1954年大，而收成却大大超过1954年。总计全洼共收秋粮一千五百六十三万斤，为1954年的三倍，光四万五千亩粳稻就收了八百一十万斤。
    在邢台的深山区，有一个石槽村农业社，这一带土地辽阔而耕地很少，每人不过一亩来地；山也是一片秃山。全村一百六十来户人家，解放前只有十来户地主、富农和上中农有吃的。多数农民生活困难，每年总有三、四十人出外讨饭。当时每亩土地的产量，水旱地平均不过一百多斤。1938年八路军来了以后，实行减租减息，以后又进行土地改革，组织互助，土地产量提高到二百来斤；1954年组织初级社，开始实行因地种植，粮食产量平均每亩三百七十五斤，总产量十七万九千斤；1955年为了扩大耕地面积、培植果树，全村用集体力量垒堾（即用石垒的地边），修梯田，加以精耕细作，使全村粮食产量达到二十八万多斤，每亩平均五百五十斤；去年转入高级社，所有土地完全统一经营，推广高产作物，实行技术改革，全村平均亩产七百斤，总产量达三十五万斤。三年之中粮食增产一倍。此外，全社还大量培植林木果树，三年中已培植三千来亩，连过去的已达到四千亩。十年以后，林木的收入将会远远超过农业。
    从无数这样事例中，可以看出合作制度的优越性：第一，由于土地界限消灭，统一经营，就能集中力量改造土地，实行生产改革。很显然，如果没有高级合作化，太河洼改造洼地的办法就不可能实行。不说别的，光修格堤所损耗的许多土地，在个体经济时代谁会承担呢？第二，由于实行集体劳动和按劳取酬，大大解放了劳动力。一方面大家都愿多出工多得报酬，因而高级社在土地加工上一般都比初级社多（如石槽村社去年每亩土地平均比前年增加三个多工，这样就更能精耕细作）；另一方面，由于集体劳动，就产生了一种为个人力所不及的“合力”，如石槽村社修梯田垒堾，需要搬运很多巨石，小的数十斤，大的上千斤，如果没有多数人的合力协作是很难办到的。第三，正由于合作统一经营，就可以充分发挥各人的长处，来专门经营某些业务，如种植、畜养、副业、培植林木等。特别某些专门技术组织的成立，对发展生产作用更大。第四，是财力（主要是生产资料）的集中。很显然，太河洼如果没有高级社把大家的生产资料都集中起来，并利用群众的投资，是不可能举办这样巨大的生产建设事业的。
    马克思在“法兰西阶级斗争”中曾指出个体农民及其小块土地的弱点说：那些所谓“自由的土地所有者”，“在小块地制度下，土地对于农民全然是生产工具。但是土地的出产率随着土地被割碎程度的增长而递减。使用机器耕作土地，分工制度，大规模的土壤改良措施，如开凿排水渠和灌溉渠等，都愈来愈不可能实行，而耕作土地的冗费却按照这生产工具本身被割碎的比例而递增……”我们中国的历史事实，充分证明了这个道理。而合作制度则克服了上面所说的缺点。
    河北省也有些农业生产合作社是增产不增收的，有些社只有一部分人增收，还有一部分人不增收甚至减收。据通县专区一千一百六十二个社分类统计，增产社中只有77.88％的户数增加了收入，这就是说还有22.12％的户数没有增加收入。这能不能说是合作社的制度不好呢？不能。据分析，这部分社员减少收入的原因很多；这些原因都与工作上的缺点有关，而与农业社制度无关。第一，去年春天刚组织农业社的时候，许多地方只集中注意农业生产，忽视了副业和其他林牧业等生产。河北农民历史上依靠副业的收入是不少的。1955年，副业收入即占农副业总收入的21％，其他林牧业的比重也不小。丢掉和忽视副业、林牧业的结果，虽然在粮棉上增了产，而总收入则不能不减少。另外，有很多合作社，重视农业而又发展多种经济，就大大地增加了收入。如霸县胜芳镇有二十一个农业社，由于农副业兼顾，去年从2月到4月两个月时间，光织席捞鱼就收入了七十多万元，除了满足农民日用需要，还有力地支持了农业。如买农药、肥料和动力机器等。这些都说明减少收入是经营上的问题而不是制度上的问题。第二，财务开支太大。这同去春所定生产指标过高、经营方针不明确有关系。有些社由于开支过多，成本过大，造成增产不增收，这显然也是经营方面的问题。第三是联村社中的村与村的经济不平衡。过去有些村由于地多地肥，用工少而收入高，有些村地少又瘦，用工多而收入少，并社以后，由于增产不多，平均分配的结果，原来收入少的穷村，突然增加很多收入，而富村不得不因而减收。因此，在许多地方都造成合作社内村与村的矛盾。这主要是社的规模问题，而不是合作制度问题。适当划小或在分配的时候合理加以解决，问题就不存在了。
    有些人说，“农业社只在平时优越，一遇灾荒就不优越了。”这种说法更是错误的。去年河北发了很大的洪水，连同其他风、雹、虫等灾害，全省遭灾县份达一百多个，由于实现了高级合作化，一般的抗灾能力是大大地加强了。如邢台东汪农业社，面临七里河，每年洪水暴发都要冲地，去年6、7月阴雨连绵，社里就积极作防水准备，将壮年社员分为六队集中睡觉，8月初洪水到来，全社人一齐出动，壮年人在前面筑堤打埝，妇女、老年在后运输泥土草料，水涨一尺，埝高一尺，昼夜不停，终于战胜了过路的洪水。附近许多村庄因未早作准备，多遭水刷，而这个社大部分的庄稼都保卫住了，结果每亩还平均收秋粮一百八十斤。许多人都说，要是没有高级社，是不能战胜洪水的。
    在生产自救中，高级社更显示了特殊的作用。洪水暴发以后，我曾到过涿县、高阳去访问。这些地方的庄稼虽然一洗精光，但群众情绪都很稳定。原因是一方面群众都知道共产党不让饿死人，另一方面合作社积极组织大家渡荒，拟定了修房、抢秋和副业生产的计划，群众感到有靠头，所以他们信心很高。据最近河北受灾的七个专区统计，截至12月中旬止，光由政府和合作社组织副业生产的收入已达一亿一千三百万元。1954年河北也遭大水，淹地四千万亩，灾民也是一千多万，当时由于很多社都是初级社，单干户还很多，副业生产就不如去年。据统计自1954年8月遭灾后到1955年5月底共十个月，灾区副业收入共一亿四千六百多万元，每月平均一千四百六十万元；而去年只四个来月就收入一亿多元，每月平均二千八百万元，这里充分说明了在抗灾斗争中高级社的优越性。
    据我所知，凡是灾后工作好的社，一般都没有多大问题；只有那些不积极想办法、不去组织社员和灾荒斗争的社，社员思想才比较混乱。西营农业社在灾害面前呈现瓦解状态，正是说明这个社的干部消极失望、没有积极地采取有效的办法领导群众。放着优越条件不利用，反倒说高级社渡荒没有优越性。这不是怪论么？
    怀疑合作社的优越性，甚至公然提出单干比合作社强，追其根源是有它的阶级因素的。当去年合作化的时候，有些比较富裕的农民，是随着风暴卷进来的。刚办起的社生产水平又不容易很快提高，因而他们的收入一般很难有大的增加，有的还要减少，不少社减少收入的，主要是这些富裕户，因此，他们不满合作社，怀疑合作社的优越性，说合作社这样那样的坏话，有些没有辨明情况的人，就也跟着说。一任这种思想发展的结果，就会瓦解合作社，走资本主义的道路。
    我们必须驳斥“高级社不优越”、“合作社不如单干”等谬论。现在河北已大规模开展政治宣传运动，教育干部和农民，使他们坚决走合作化的道路，巩固社会主义在农村的阵地。
