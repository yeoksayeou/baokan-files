Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 24th (Xinhua Reporter Lu Ying): The number of prisoners is decreasing in Shanghai's famous "Tilanqiao" Prison.

This prison, well-known to Shanghai citizens before liberation, consists of more than ten reinforced concrete buildings housing prison cells. Before liberation, a cell the size of a single bed would be crammed with three or four prisoners. But now, on several floors of the building, rows of cell doors are open day and night, and no one is to be seen. The reporter visited a building for heavily sentenced prisoners. All the cells on the ground floor were empty. Several staff members were interrogating prisoners on the left corridor. These prisoners were sitting, wearing ordinary clothes, without handcuffs or shackles. The right corridor had become the prisoners' club and reading room. Some prisoners were reading newspapers and playing chess, while others were rehearsing Peking Opera. The empty cells are now used to store books, medicine, and props and costumes for the plays. On the wall newspaper in the corridor were posted confessions from these criminals who had seriously harmed the people, expressing their determination to accept reform and strive for sentence reduction. From the second to the fifth floor of this prison building, some cells were also empty.

In this prison, people no longer hear the shouts and cries of the past; only the sound of printing presses and knitting machines. In a women's prison building, many of the larger cells and corridors have been turned into workshops, where male and female prisoners are knitting socks, gloves, and making toy dolls. Only the juvenile offender cells are occupied by female prisoners. The prison's several rubber cells have been unoccupied for a long time. Before liberation, many prisoners who suffered injustice and became mentally disturbed were locked up here to prevent them from committing suicide. Now, a thick layer of dust has accumulated on the rubber floors.

Song Shaochang, who worked in this prison before liberation, recalled the crowded conditions of the prison in those years: "Ten years ago, this place was full of robbers and murderers. There were far more guards in the prison than there are now, and the guards had to patrol the cells day and night. But now, the number of people being released after serving their sentences is constantly increasing, the number of incoming prisoners is constantly decreasing, and there are more and more empty cells. This is something that has never happened before at Tilanqiao Prison."

The decreasing number of prisoners in Shanghai prisons is the result of the year-by-year decrease in criminal cases in Shanghai. According to statistics from January to September last year, the number of criminal cases accepted by courts at all levels in Shanghai decreased by 68% compared with 1955. From April to September of last year, the monthly average number of criminal offenders convicted by the courts decreased by 79% compared with the monthly average number over the past six years.

    上海市刑事案件逐年递减
    “提篮桥”监狱犯人越来越少
    新华社上海24日电　新华社记者鲁影报道：上海市出名的“提篮桥”监狱中，犯人愈来愈少了。
    在解放前为上海市民所熟知的这座监狱共包括十多幢钢骨水泥建筑的监房。解放以前，这里一间像单人床一样大的监舍里就要挤着三、四个犯人，但是现在大楼的好几层监房里，成排监舍的铁门日夜敞开着，看不见一个人。记者参观了一幢重刑犯监房，底层的监舍全部空着。左面走廊上有几个工作人员正在提审犯人，这些犯人坐着，穿着普通的衣服，身上没有手铐脚镣。右面的走廊成了犯人的俱乐部、阅览室。有的犯人正在看报、下棋，有的犯人正在排演京剧。空着的监舍现在被用来放书籍、治病的药品和演戏用的道具、服装。在走廊里的墙报上，贴着这些严重危害人民的罪犯表示接受改造和争取改刑的决心悔过书。从这幢监房大楼第二层走到第五层，有一些监舍也空荡荡地没有犯人。
    在这座监狱里，人们听不到解放以前的那种叫骂声、哭声，只有印刷机、针织机的转动声。在一幢女犯的监房大楼里，很多较宽大的监舍和走廊，变成了工场，男女犯人正在织袜子、手套和做玩具洋娃娃，只有少教监舍住着女犯。监狱里的数间橡皮监舍已经好久没有人住了。解放前，很多无理受刑而引起精神不正常的犯人就被关在这里，以防止他们自杀。现在橡皮地板上积起了不少灰尘。
    解放前就在这座监狱工作的宋绍长，回忆起当年监狱罪犯拥挤的情景说：“十年前，这里关满了强盗和杀人犯。监房看守人员比现在多得多，看守人员必须日夜在监房里巡逻。但是现在，刑满释放的人在不断增加，进来的犯人不断地在减少，空的监舍多起来了，这是提篮桥监狱所从来没有的现象。”
    上海市监狱中的犯人越来越少，是上海市刑事案件逐年减少的结果。据去年1月到9月的统计，上海市各级法院的刑事案件收案数就比1955年减少了68％；从去年4月到9月的六个月中，由法院判决确立的刑事罪犯的每月平均人数，比过去六年多以来的每月平均人数减少了79％。
