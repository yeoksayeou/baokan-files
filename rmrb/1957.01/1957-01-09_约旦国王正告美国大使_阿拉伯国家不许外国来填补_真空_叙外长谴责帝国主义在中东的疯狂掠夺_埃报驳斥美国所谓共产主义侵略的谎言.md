Xinhua News Agency, January 8th, Amman Dispatch: According to sources in the Jordanian Royal Palace, King Hussein of Jordan told the U.S. Ambassador to Jordan that Arab countries will fill any vacuum in the Middle East themselves and will not allow foreign powers to fill it.

	He said this to the U.S. Ambassador, Lester Mallory, when summoning him to discuss Eisenhower's Middle East policy address.

	The Jordanian King said that the Arabs would welcome any economic or military aid that did not come with political conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, January 8th, TASS Damascus, January 7th Dispatch: Many Jordanian political parties and groups have sent telegrams and letters to the U.S. Ambassador to Jordan, protesting the U.S. imperialist plan for the Middle East.

	A youth organization in Amman said in a telegram to the U.S. Ambassador that the so-called "new trend" of U.S. Middle East policy is merely a continuation of the Baghdad Pact and the imperialist policy of the tripartite aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel. We strongly protest against "Eisenhowerism."

	Teachers in the Nablus district wrote in a telegram: "We protest against the U.S. imperialist policy in the Middle East, and we declare that we will resolutely fight against all imperialist conspiracies."

Xinhua News Agency, January 8th, TASS Damascus, January 7th Dispatch: In commenting on Eisenhower's Middle East policy address, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told reporters that Syria "determines its policies in Arab relations based on the principle of complete independence, and in international relations based on the principle of active neutrality. This active neutrality is the absolute independence of the Arabs."

	Bitar continued, "Certain imperialist countries regard our countries merely as sources of raw materials and oil, markets for the industrial products of imperialist countries, and strategic bases for protecting their interests. This view of imperialist countries is completely contrary to the view of the Arabs as the sole masters of their own wealth."

	Speaking of the relationship between the United States and Arab countries, Bitar said: "It is wrong to think that the Middle East is a 'vacuum' zone. A policy of cooperation cannot be built on this view."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 8th: Anwar Sadat, editor-in-chief of "Al-Gomhouria," refuted the U.S.-fabricated lie of so-called communist "aggression" against the Middle East in an article published in the newspaper on the 7th. Sadat said that Egypt had just been subjected to aggression by Britain, France, and Israel. How could it be expected to believe that "the supposed danger to the Middle East comes from countries under the control of world communism"?

	He said: "These three countries, not 'controlled by world communism,' recently killed our women and children, and Israelis are massacring Arabs in the areas they occupy. And at this time, someone wants us to believe the above view."

	Ihsan Abdel Koddus wrote in a recent issue of "Rose al-Youssef" magazine that the new Eisenhower plan "certainly is not decorated with olive branches. In fact, it enticingly expresses a willingness to offer magical gold coins while making threats to use swords."

    叙外长谴责帝国主义在中东的疯狂掠夺
    埃报驳斥美国所谓共产主义侵略的谎言
    新华社8日讯　安曼消息：据约旦王宫人士说，约旦国王侯赛尼曾经对美国驻约旦大使说，阿拉伯国家将自己来填补中东的任何真空，而不允许外国来填补。
    这是他在召见美国大使莱斯特·马洛里时就艾森豪威尔的中东政策咨文而说的。
    约旦国王说，阿拉伯人将欢迎任何不附有政治条件的经济或军事援助。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社大马士革7日讯：约旦的许多政党和团体纷纷发电报和寄信给美国驻约旦的大使，抗议美国关于中东地区的帝国主义计划。
    安曼的一个青年组织在给美国大使的电报中说，美国中东政策的所谓“新趋势”，不过是巴格达条约和英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及的帝国主义政策的继续。我们坚决抗议“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    纳布鲁斯区的教师们在电报中写道：“我们抗议美国在中东的帝国主义政策，我们宣布，我们将坚决为反对帝国主义的一切阴谋而斗争。”
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社大马士革7日讯：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在评论艾森豪威尔中东政策咨文的时候对记者说，叙利亚“在阿拉伯国家关系方面是根据完全独立原则、在国际关系方面是依据积极中立原则来决定自己的政策的。这种积极中立就是阿拉伯人的绝对独立”。
  比塔尔接着说，某些帝国主义国家把我们这些国家仅仅当作原料和石油的产地、帝国主义国家工业品的销售市场和保护它们利益的战略基地。帝国主义国家的这种观点是完全违反作为自己财富唯一主人的阿拉伯人的观点的。
    比塔尔在谈到美国同阿拉伯国家之间的关系的时候说：“认为中东地区是个‘真空’地带，那是错误的。不能在这种看法的基础上建立合作政策”。
    据新华社开罗8日电　“共和国报”主编安瓦尔·萨达特7日在这家报纸上发表的一篇文章中驳斥了美国揑造的所谓共产主义对中东的“侵略”的谎言。萨达特说，埃及刚刚受到英、法、以色列这三个国家的侵略，怎么能够要它相信“对中东的假定的危险是来自世界共产主义控制的国家”呢？
    他说：“这三个不是‘世界共产主义控制’的国家最近杀害了我们的妇女和儿童，以色列人正在他们所占领的地区屠杀着阿拉伯人，而在这种时候，竟然有人要我们相信上面那样的看法。”
    伊赫桑·阿卜杜勒·科杜斯在最近一期“鲁兹·优素福”杂志上写道，新的艾森豪威尔计划“肯定没有装饰上橄榄枝。事实上他是在诱人地表示愿意提供有魔力的金元的同时作出了要使用刀剑的威胁”。
