    Xinhua News Agency, January 24th, Tel Aviv Dispatch: Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion openly declared on the 23rd that Israel would never allow Egypt to return to the Gaza Strip, and would not withdraw troops from the Gulf of Aqaba until it received guarantees that Israeli ships could pass through the Gulf of Aqaba.
    This is the first time Israel has officially stated its attitude towards these two regions, and directly defied the United Nations General Assembly resolution passed on the 19th demanding Israel's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Egyptian territory.
    In a policy statement to the Knesset, Ben-Gurion said that Israel demanded to sign an agreement with the three countries along the Gulf of Aqaba – Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan – to guarantee free navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba, or that United Nations forces be stationed in the Gulf of Aqaba region to guarantee free navigation in this Gulf until Israel reaches an agreement with Egypt.
    Ben-Gurion stated firmly that he would not return the Gaza Strip occupied by Israel to Egypt, saying that this was determined by Israel's "security" needs. He said that if Israeli troops withdrew from the Gaza Strip, it would still retain administrative control over the area "so that the status of this area can be resolved in the future," and also in order to "defend" Israel and "pave the way" for solving the refugee problem.
    He also demanded that the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula be "demilitarized" by the United Nations.
    Ben-Gurion's policy statement was supported by a majority vote in the Knesset on the evening of the 23rd.

    公然藐视联大决议
    以色列拒绝无条件从埃及撤军
    新华社24日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列总理本—古里安23日公然宣称以色列决不允许埃及再回到加沙地区，而且非到获得以色列船只能够在亚喀巴湾通行的保证，不从这个海湾撤兵。
    这是以色列第一次正式表明对这两个地区的态度，并且直接藐视了联合国大会19日通过的要求以色列立即无条件撤出埃及领土的决议。
    本—古里安在议会发表政策声明时说，以色列要求同亚喀巴湾沿岸的三个国家——埃及、沙特阿拉伯、约旦——共同签订一项协定来保证亚喀巴湾的自由通航，或者由联合国部队进驻亚喀巴湾地区，来保证这个港湾的自由通航，直到以色列同埃及达成协议为止。
    本—古里安表示坚决不把以色列侵占的加沙地带交还埃及，他说这是由以色列的“安全”需要决定的。他说，假如以色列军队撤出加沙地带，它仍然要保留对这个地带的行政控制，“以便使这个地带的地位问题能够在将来得到解决”，同时也为了“保卫”以色列和为解决难民问题“铺平道路”。
    他还要求联合国把埃及的西奈半岛实行“非军事化”。
    本—古里安的政策声明23日晚上在议会得到多数票的支持。
