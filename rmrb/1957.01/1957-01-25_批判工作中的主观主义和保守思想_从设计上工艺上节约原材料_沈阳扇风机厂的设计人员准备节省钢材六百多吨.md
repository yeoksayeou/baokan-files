Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 24th. Technical personnel at the Shenyang Fan Blower Factory are actively correcting subjectivism and conservatism in design and technological work, and taking measures to save steel materials.

After studying the documents of the "Eighth National Congress," the factory's engineers and technicians proactively examined their thinking and work, enhancing their sense of responsibility for building socialism. At the "Product Review Meeting," they criticized the "insurance" mentality that existed in design and technological work. In the past, whether in design or in the specification of machining allowances, they always believed that using larger rather than smaller raw materials was safer, using thicker rather than thinner materials was safer, and using longer rather than shorter materials was safer. As a result, the produced fans were not only too heavy, but also a lot of steel material was cut away. For example, the volute side panels of the fan used to be manufactured with three-millimeter-thick iron plates according to the design specifications; however, after changing to one-and-a-half-millimeter-thick iron plates, the quality was still very good, and more than 50 tons of iron plates could be saved annually.

Now, the factory's designers and process personnel have put forward 166 suggestions for improving design and process methods, and have discussed and determined the suggestions that can be adopted at the technical debate meetings they held. After these suggestions are implemented, 602 tons of steel materials can be saved this year. Among them, the weight of each "BY type" fan can be reduced by 3,800 kilograms, and due to the reduction of machining allowances and safety factors for various parts, 97 tons of steel can be cut less throughout the year.
The Sifang Rolling Stock Plant Will Reduce the Tare Weight of Sleeping Cars by One-Tenth

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, January 24th. The designers of the Design Section of the Sifang Rolling Stock Plant, while ensuring quality, have changed the design of the ㄙㄑ-21 type hard-seat sleeper car, which will reduce the tare weight of the car by one-tenth, saving the country five tons of raw materials such as steel and wood per car.

After repeatedly conducting education on increasing production and practicing economy for the designers in early January and criticizing the conservative thinking in the past design, the Design Section of the factory proposed to change the design of the ㄙㄑ-21 type hard-seat sleeper car, which is currently being produced in large quantities, on the premise of ensuring quality, to reduce the tare weight of the car and save five tons of raw materials such as steel and wood per car. They also specifically planned the savings figures for the steel structure part, the wood structure part, and other parts. After two days of discussion on the 7th and 8th, the designers expressed their determination to implement this plan and immediately acted in groups. In the past half month, the steel structure design team has completed more than a dozen design projects such as side wall panels, end wall panels, longitudinal beams and side beams on the roof, which can save more than two tons of steel per car. During this period, the wood structure design team has definitely saved more than one ton of wood due to the design changes. For example, by changing the large partition wall of the sleeper compartment from a twelve-millimeter-thick mortise board to a ten-millimeter-thick plywood, more than 250 kilograms of wood can be saved per car, and two-thirds of the processing time can be saved; appropriately thinning the inner side wall panels can also save one-third of the plywood per car. The bogie design team studied the elimination of two auxiliary longitudinal beams, one auxiliary transverse beam, and damping springs, which can save 800 kilograms of steel per car. Changing the brake lever head from forging to electric welding and appropriately thinning the air cylinder can also save 200 kilograms of steel. Now, this group has definitely saved one ton of steel, which is 400 kilograms more than the original plan. The water supply and heating equipment design team and the electrical equipment design team have also tried to save raw materials.

Now, the designers of this section have realized the plan to reduce the tare weight of the ㄙㄑ-21 type sleeper car and save five tons of steel and wood raw materials. They are preparing to study and improve the design of the new 23.6-meter all-steel passenger car based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and it is estimated that the tare weight of the car can be reduced by at least seven to eight tons.

    批判工作中的主观主义和保守思想
    从设计上工艺上节约原材料
    沈阳扇风机厂的设计人员准备节省钢材六百多吨
    新华社沈阳24日电　沈阳扇风机厂技术人员，积极纠正设计和工艺工作中的主观主义和保守思想，采取措施节约钢铁材料。
    这个工厂的工程师、技术员们，在学习“八大”文件以后，主动地检查了思想和工作，增强了建设社会主义的责任心。他们在“产品回忆会”上，批判了在设计、工艺工作中存在的“保险”思想。过去，他们不论在设计上或是加工余量的规定上，使用的原材料总是认为大比小保险，粗比细保险，长比短保险，厚比薄保险。这样，生产出来的扇风机不但机体太重，切削掉的钢铁材料也很多。如扇风机上的蜗壳侧板，按过去设计规定要用三公厘厚的铁板制造；但是，改用一点五公厘厚的铁板以后，质量仍然很好，全年可以节省铁板五十多吨。
    现在，这个工厂的设计人员和工艺人员，已经提出了一百六十六件改进设计和工艺方法的建议，并且在他们召开的技术争辩会上，讨论确定了可以采纳的建议。这些建议实现以后，今年可以节省出钢铁材料六百零二吨。其中，每台“BY型”扇风机的体重可以减轻三千八百公斤，由于各种部件的加工余量和保险系数的缩小，全年可以少切削掉钢材九十七吨。
  四方机车车辆制造厂将使卧车自重减轻十分之一
    新华社青岛24日电　四方机车车辆制造工厂设计科的设计人员在保证质量的基础上，改变ㄙㄑ二十一型硬席卧车设计，将使车辆自重减轻十分之一，每辆车可以为国家节省五吨钢材、木材等原材料。
    这个工厂设计科在1月初反复地向设计人员进行增产节约教育、批判了过去在设计上的保守思想以后提出，在保证质量的前提下，改变现在大批生产的ㄙㄑ二十一型硬席卧车设计，减轻车辆自重，节约五吨钢材、木材等原材料的方案，并且具体规划了在钢结构部分、木结构部分及其他部分的节约数字。经过7日、8日两天的讨论，设计人员都表示决心实现这一方案，并且立即分组行动起来。在最近的半个月中，钢结构设计小组已经完成的侧墙板、端墙板、车顶上的纵间梁和边梁等十多个设计项目，即可使每辆车节省两吨多钢材。木结构设计小组在这期间，由于改变设计已经肯定可以节省一吨多的木材。例如他们把卧铺间的大隔壁子由十二公厘厚的插口板改为十公厘厚的胶合板，每辆车就可以节约二百五十多公斤木材、并且能节省三分之二的加工工时；把里侧墙板适当减薄，也使每辆车节省了三分之一的胶合板。转向架设计小组研究取消两根补助纵梁、一根补助横梁和缓解弹簧，每辆车可以节省钢材八百公斤。制动拉杆头子由锻接改为电焊，风缸适当减薄，也可以节约二百公斤钢材。现在，这个小组已经肯定可以节省一吨钢材，比原规划多节约四百公斤。给水暖气设备设计小组、电气设备设计小组也都想办法节约了原材料。
    现在，这个科的设计人员已经实现了ㄙㄑ二十一型卧车减轻车辆自重，节约五吨钢材、木材等原材料的规划。他们正准备根据苏联的先进经验，研究改进二十三点六公尺全钢的新型客车的设计，估计至少可以减轻车辆自重七吨到八吨。
