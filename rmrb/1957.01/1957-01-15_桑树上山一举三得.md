Planting Mulberry Trees on Mountains Achieves Three Benefits in One Stroke

    (Our report) The Qikeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province, which initially succeeded in planting mulberry trees on mountains, is now developing sericulture production in a planned way. From 1952 to 1956, this cooperative has planted 47,750 mulberry trees on reclaimed barren mountains. In 1957, it plans to raise 122 sheets of silkworm eggs and produce 7,079 jin of silkworm cocoons. The cooperative members said: "Planting mulberry trees on mountains can not only green the barren mountains, solve the problem of surplus labor, and increase income, but also increase the production of industrial raw materials for the country. It's truly achieving three benefits in one stroke."

    桑树上山一举三得
    本报讯　浙江省最初向山上栽植桑树成功的于潜县七坑农业生产合作社，正在有计划地发展桑蚕生产。从1952年到1956年，这个社已在开垦过的荒山上种植桑树四万七千七百五十株。1957年计划饲养蚕种一百二十二张，生产蚕茧七千零七十九斤。社员们说：“桑树上山，不仅能绿化荒山，解决剩余劳动力的出路问题，增加收入，还能为国家增产工业原料，真是一举三得。”
