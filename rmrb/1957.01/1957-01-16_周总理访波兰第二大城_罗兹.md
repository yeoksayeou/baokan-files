Premier Zhou Enlai said: The Chinese people are not unfamiliar with distant Łódź, which has always been a famous center of the Polish workers' movement and is respected by us. After a long and arduous struggle, the Polish working class has become the master of the country and is leading the people of the whole country in achieving great achievements in the cause of building socialism. On behalf of the Chinese people, I pay tribute to the working class and all the people of Łódź. Premier Zhou then said: We also feel particularly close to your city because a group of Chinese students are studying in Łódź. Thanks to the help of the people of Łódź, they have been able to gain your experience, technology, and knowledge in construction. I would like to express my special gratitude to you for this. At this time, the band played the national anthems of China and Poland.

As Premier Zhou Enlai left the station, he said to the enthusiastic welcomers in Polish: "Dziękuję!" (Polish for "Thank you!")
