Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th - The Dalai Lama and his party arrived in Gangtok, the densely forested capital of Sikkim, by car on the morning of January 29th at the invitation of the Maharaja of Sikkim.

The Maharaja of Sikkim, wearing shining yellow satin robes, welcomed the guests in the palace-like monastery on the hilltop. He and the Dalai Lama presented each other with hadas. Along the streets of the city, people burned incense and pine needles in incense burners and lined up to greet the guests with their palms together.

When the Dalai Lama and his party crossed the border between India and Sikkim and arrived at Sikkim's Rangpo town, twenty-four miles southeast of Gangtok, the Dalai Lama was greeted by Sikkim's two princes, Palden Thondup Namgyal and Tenzing Gyaltsen, as well as the Prime Minister of Sikkim, and reviewed a guard of honor composed of Sikkim police.

The Dalai Lama will stay in Sikkim for six days.
