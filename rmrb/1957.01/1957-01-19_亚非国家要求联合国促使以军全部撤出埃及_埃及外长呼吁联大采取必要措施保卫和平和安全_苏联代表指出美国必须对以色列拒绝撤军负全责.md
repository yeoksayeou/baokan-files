Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th: At the request of the Egyptian representative, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the 17th to discuss the issue of Israel's failure to fully withdraw its troops from Egypt.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi emphasized in his speech that the United Nations General Assembly must once again address Israel's intolerable acts of aggression, which began last year and are still continuing. He pointed out that although the United Nations General Assembly passed resolutions demanding that Israel unconditionally withdraw all its troops from Egyptian territory, Israel shamelessly refuses to implement these resolutions.

After pointing out that Israel threatens peace and security in the Near East, Fawzi called on the United Nations General Assembly to reaffirm its determination to uphold the United Nations Charter and take all necessary measures to defend peace and security.

Ceylon representative Gunawardene presented a proposal to the Assembly on behalf of twenty-five Asian and African countries, demanding the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egyptian territory. The proposal referred to the United Nations General Assembly's past resolutions on this issue and regretted that Israel had not fulfilled the provisions of these resolutions. The proposal suggested that the United Nations Secretary-General "continue his efforts to expedite Israel's withdrawal in accordance with the aforementioned resolutions, and report to the Assembly on this issue within five days."

Gunawardene expressed surprise in his speech at the United Nations Secretary-General's preparation to hold "further negotiations" with the Israeli representative on the issue of the Gaza Strip. He said, "We believe that this is a matter that needs no discussion. Because there is already a United Nations General Assembly resolution regarding the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Egyptian territory, and this resolution should be fully and unconditionally implemented."

Representatives from Jordan, Syria, Sudan, Iraq, Japan, and Bolivia all expressed support for the twenty-five-nation proposal in their speeches.

Australian representative Spender actually spoke as a defender of the Israeli aggressors. He promoted the plan recently brewed by some people in Western countries—to send "United Nations International Police Force" into the Gaza Strip, and not immediately transfer this area to Egyptian troops. He also said that his delegation believes that "corresponding measures must be taken to guarantee the international status of the Gulf of Aqaba." New Zealand representative Munro also put forward similar opinions. Munro advocated studying the possibility of establishing a so-called "demilitarized zone" between Israel and Egypt, and demanded that United Nations forces not withdraw until the issues of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba are resolved.

Israeli Foreign Minister Meir tried her best to defend Israel's refusal to implement the Assembly's resolutions. She said that Israel is willing to discuss the issue of withdrawing from the Gaza Strip, but Israel believes that it must obtain assurances that United Nations forces will be stationed in the Gaza Strip and the Sharm el-Sheikh area of the Gulf of Aqaba.

United States representative Lodge said: the United States is in favor of all foreign troops withdrawing behind the armistice demarcation line, and will vote in favor of the twenty-five-nation proposal. But he went on to point out, "The United States believes that United Nations forces must move in closely behind Israeli troops to ensure the ceasefire and armistice agreement." He said, "We believe that the United Nations Emergency Force should be deployed in a way that can prevent the resumption of hostilities," "We hope that the Secretary-General will be able to announce the further deployment of the United Nations Emergency Force along the armistice demarcation line and in the Strait of Tiran (in Sharm el-Sheikh) area."

The head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, said that the report of United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld clearly shows that Israel continues to disregard the United Nations and puts forward various artificial excuses to prolong the Israeli army's occupation of Egyptian territory. The Israeli government's statement shows that Israel has no intention of returning the Gaza Strip to Egypt. All of this shows that the Israeli ruling clique is plotting a plan to annex the territory of its Arab neighbors. The policy adopted by the Israeli government is tantamount to a provocation against the people of the Middle Eastern countries.

Kuznetsov pointed out that Israel could not have taken this action without the direct support of Britain, France, and certain influential figures in the United States. He pointed out that the aggressive bloc, especially the aggressive bloc of the United States, gives Israel a special position in their further plans for aggression. The United States is fully responsible for the current situation in the Near East and Israel's refusal to withdraw its troops.

Kuznetsov refuted the plan proposed by the Australian representative regarding the occupation of the Gaza Strip by United Nations forces. He pointed out that this is a plan to annex Egyptian territory for a long time. This plan is directed against the people of the Middle East and Near East. Kuznetsov also accused Eisenhower's Middle East plan, pointing out that this plan is an attempt by the United States to conceal its imperialist conspiracy in the Middle East. Kuznetsov finally expressed his support for the proposal of the Asian and African countries.

After Kuznetsov's speech, the Assembly adjourned. The next meeting will be held on the 18th.

    亚非国家要求联合国促使以军全部撤出埃及
    埃及外长呼吁联大采取必要措施保卫和平和安全
    苏联代表指出美国必须对以色列拒绝撤军负全责
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：应埃及代表的请求，联合国大会17日举行全体会议，讨论以色列不全部从埃及撤军的问题。
    埃及外交部长法齐在发言时强调说，联合国大会要再次过问以色列在去年发动的而到目前还在继续的不可容忍的侵略行为。他指出，虽然联合国大会通过了要求以色列无条件从埃及领土撤出全部军队的决议，但是，以色列仍然厚颜无耻地拒绝执行这些决议。
    在指出以色列威胁近东的和平和安全以后，法齐呼吁联合国大会重申支持联合国宪章和采取一切必要的保卫和平和安全的措施的决心。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼代表二十五个亚非国家向大会提出一项提案，要求以色列军队完全撤出埃及领土。这个提案提到联合国大会过去就这个问题通过的决议，并且遗憾地指出以色列没有履行这些决议的条款。提案建议联合国秘书长“继续努力促使以色列根据上述决议迅速撤出，并就这一问题在五天内向大会提出报告”。
    古纳瓦地尼在发言中对联合国秘书长准备同以色列代表就加沙地区问题举行“进一步的谈判”这一点表示惊异。他说，“我们认为，这是无须讨论的问题。因为已经有了联合国大会关于外国军队立即撤出埃及领土的决议，这项决议应当完全无条件地加以执行。”
    约旦、叙利亚、苏丹、伊拉克、日本和玻利维亚等国代表在发言中都支持二十五国提案。
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德实际上作为以色列侵略者的辩护人说话。他鼓吹西方国家某些人士近来酝酿的计划——把“联合国国际警察部队”开入加沙地区，并且不马上把这个地区移交给埃及军队。他还说，他的代表团认为，“必须采取相应的措施来保证亚喀巴湾的国际地位”。新西兰代表孟罗也提出类似的意见。孟罗主张研究在以色列和埃及之间建立所谓“非军事区”的可能性，并且要求在苏伊士和亚喀巴湾问题解决以前，联合国部队将不撤出。
    以色列外交部长梅厄竭力为以色列拒绝执行大会决议的行为辩护。她说，以色列愿意讨论撤出加沙地带的问题，但是以色列认为必须得到这样的保证：联合国部队进驻加沙地带和亚喀巴湾的沙姆沙伊赫地区。
    美国代表洛奇说：美国赞成一切外国军队撤到停战分界线后面去，并且将投票赞成二十五国提案。但是他接着指出，“美国认为，联合国军队必须紧跟在以色列军队之后开进去，以保障停火和停战协定”。他说，“我们认为，联合国紧急部队应当部署得能够防止敌对行动的重起”，“我们希望，秘书长将能够宣布联合国紧急部队在停战分界线沿线和蒂朗海峡（在沙姆沙伊赫）地区作进一步的部署。”
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫说，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的报告十分明显地表明了以色列继续藐视联合国，并且提出各种人为的借口来延长以色列军队对埃及领土的占领。以色列政府的声明表明，以色列无意把加沙地区交还给埃及。所有这一切说明了，以色列统治集团正在策划着并吞阿拉伯邻邦领土的计划。以色列政府采取的这种政策等于是对中东国家人民的挑衅。
    库兹涅佐夫指出，要是以色列没有得到英、法以及美国某些有影响的人士的直接支持，它是不可能采取这种行动的。他指出，侵略集团、特别是美国的侵略集团在它们的进一步的侵略的计划中，给予以色列以特殊的地位。对于近东目前的形势和以色列拒绝撤军，美国是要完全负责的。
    库兹涅佐夫驳斥了澳大利亚代表提出的关于由联合国部队占领加沙地区的计划。他指出，这是一个要长期吞并埃及领土的计划。这个计划的矛头是针对中近东的人民的。库兹涅佐夫还指责艾森豪威尔的中东计划，指出这个计划是美国为了掩饰它对中东的帝国主义阴谋的尝试。库兹涅佐夫最后表示支持亚非国家的提案。
    在库兹涅佐夫发言后，大会宣告休会。下次会议将在十八日举行。
