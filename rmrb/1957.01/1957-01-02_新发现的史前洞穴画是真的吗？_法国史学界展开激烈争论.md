Are Newly Discovered Prehistoric Cave Paintings Genuine?
    French Historical Circles Engage in Fierce Debate

    Recently, the French historical community is engaged in a heated debate over the authenticity of newly discovered prehistoric cave paintings.

    On July 18th last year, at the Fifteenth French Prehistoric Studies Congress held in Poitiers, France, Professor Louis-René Nougier and several other French prehistorians announced that on June 26th, they had discovered a new cave north of the Dordogne River, containing more than one hundred engravings and paintings from the late Upper Paleolithic period, dating back 20,000 years. Abbé Breuil, a French authority on the Paleolithic era, visited the site and believed that these outstanding works of art were genuine. He said the decorative frieze featuring rhinoceroses was the most beautiful piece from the entire Quaternary artistic period. This news attracted widespread attention from academic circles abroad. (See Xinhua News Agency dispatch of August 4th, this newspaper's August 5th, Seventh Edition).

    However, after the news was published, the authenticity of these paintings became a subject of controversy in France. In his recent article, "A Dispute over European Prehistoric Relics," the Frenchman Malzrié succinctly described the situation of this controversy.

    The debate was sparked after newspapers published photographs of the newly discovered rhinoceros frieze. First, Séverin-Blanc, director of the Prehistoric History Institute of the Périgord region, publicly announced that the cave discovered by Nougier and others had been known since the seventeenth century and had been subjected to multiple speleological investigations. He further stated that the most important paintings in this cave were forged after 1940. Bernard Pierret, president of the Périgueux Speleological Club, agreed with Blanc, saying that he had conducted fifty investigations of the cave between 1945 and 1949, and each time he found more and more black drawings on the cave walls. Moreover, he swore that the rhinoceros frieze that Breuil considered the best did not exist before 1948 and only appeared the following year.

    Due to the sharp criticisms raised by the opponents, Nougier and others held a press conference for domestic and foreign journalists in Paris on August 4th, and showed color slides of the paintings in the cave that they had filmed. The audience remained skeptical. On August 9th, they invited some experts and journalists for an appraisal, but the visitors were still unable to determine the authenticity of the works. Neither the press conference nor the cave visits included those holding opposing views. Subsequently, Pierret held a press conference in Périgueux, reading a letter from Guelin, a member of the Speleological Club, in which Guelin admitted that he had personally painted several of the paintings in the cave.

    Currently, the debate continues.

### 新发现的史前洞穴画是真的吗？  法国史学界展开激烈争论

    新发现的史前洞穴画是真的吗？
    法国史学界展开激烈争论
    最近，法国史学界正在为新发现的史前洞穴画的真伪问题展开激烈的争论。
    去年7月18日，在法国普瓦铁埃城召开的第十五次法国史前学大会上，法国的路易—里内·努吉埃教授宣布了他和其他几位法国史前学家，于6月26日在多尔道尼河以北地方发现一个新的洞穴，里面有一百多幅两万年以前的旧石器时代末期的雕刻和绘画。法国研究旧石器时代的权威布里亚神甫曾到现场考察，认为这些卓越的艺术品是真实的，尤其是绘有犀牛图的装饰带是整个第四纪艺术时期里最美丽的东西。这个消息引起国外学术界人士的广泛注意。（见新华社8月4日讯，本报8月5日第七版）
    可是这个消息发表以后，关于这些绘画的真伪问题，在法国引起了争论。法国马尔兹里埃在他最近所写的一篇文章“欧洲史前遗迹的一场争论”中，扼要地叙述了这一争论的情况。
    争论是在各报刊将新发现的犀牛图装饰带的照片发表后引起来的。首先是比里格尔省史前史学研究所所长塞维林—布兰公开宣布，努吉埃等人所发现的洞穴，在十七世纪已经有人知道了，而且经过多次洞窟学调查；这个洞窟中最重要的绘画，都是1940年以后伪造的。比里古城洞窟学家俱乐部主席伯纳·皮埃勒同布兰的意见是一致的，他说自己在1945—1949年间，曾对该洞进行了五十次调查，每次发现洞壁上的黑色图画越来越多。而且，他发誓说，布里亚所谓最好的那个犀牛图装饰带在1948以前是没有的，而是在第二年才出现的。
    由于反对者提出这样尖锐的意见，努吉埃等于8月4日在巴黎举行了一次国内外记者招待会，并放映了他们拍摄下来的这个洞窟中绘画的彩色幻灯片，观看的人仍然是半信半疑。8月9日他们又邀请了一些专家和记者进行了一次鉴定，参观者对作品的真假还是无法判断。不管是招待记者或者是参观洞穴，都没有邀请持反对意见的人参加。接着，皮埃勒在比里古城举行了一次记者招待会，宣读了洞窟学家俱乐部的会员盖兰的一封信，在这封信里盖兰承认洞窟中的几幅画是他亲手画的。
    现在，这场争论还在继续。
