Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: The joyous festive atmosphere of Beijing first descended upon the doors of families of martyrs and military personnel. In recent days, neighbors and elementary school students have cleaned the courtyards of families of martyrs and military personnel and pasted bright red Spring Festival couplets on their doors. The street offices also sent cadres to visit the families of martyrs and military personnel, distributing Spring Festival living allowances to impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel.

In recent days, the People's Committees and street offices of various districts have been holding joint army-government-people celebrations, where films, dramas, Peking operas, and song and dance performances are presented for families of martyrs, military personnel, demobilized soldiers, and disabled soldiers. Xuanwu, Qianmen, and four other districts have held representative meetings of families of martyrs, military personnel, demobilized soldiers, and disabled soldiers, reviewing and summarizing the work of preferential treatment and resettlement of demobilized soldiers in 1956, and conveying the spirit of the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Families of Martyrs, Military Personnel, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers.

The Beijing Municipal People's Committee has formed five groups, including political and legal affairs and culture and education, starting from the 26th, to exchange views on work with the corresponding leaders of the troops stationed in Beijing. The masses of the residents' committees in various streets also held forums with the local garrison troops to solicit opinions from each other. All sectors of the people of Beijing and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing will also hold a Spring Festival get-together on the evening of the first day of the lunar calendar, with more than 4,000 people participating in support-the-army and preferential treatment and support-the-government and cherish-the-people activities.

The heads of the People's Committees of many districts have also joined street residents in visiting the wounded and sick soldiers in the area these days.

    新华社27日讯　北京市喜气洋洋的节日景象首先降临到了烈属、军属的门前。这几天，街坊邻居和小学生们为烈属、军属打扫了院落，并且在他们的门上贴上了大红春联。各街道办事处也派干部访问了烈、军属家庭，把春节生活补助费发给贫苦的烈、军属。
    连日来，各区人民委员会和街道办事处都在召开军、政、民联欢大会，在会上为烈属、军属、复员军人、残废军人演出电影、话剧、京剧和歌舞节目。宣武、前门等六个区已分别召开了烈属、军属、复员军人、残废军人代表会议，检查和总结了1956年的优抚和复员军人安置工作，并且传达了全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会的精神。
    北京市人民委员会已于26日起组成政法、文教等五个组，分别同驻京部队的同级领导人交换工作当中的意见。各街道居民委员会的群众也与当地驻军举行座谈会，相互征求意见。北京市各界人民和驻京人民解放军还将在旧历初一日的晚上举行有四千多人参加的拥军优属、拥政爱民春节联欢大会。
    许多区的人民委员会负责人这几天还和街道群众一起慰问了驻地的伤病员。
