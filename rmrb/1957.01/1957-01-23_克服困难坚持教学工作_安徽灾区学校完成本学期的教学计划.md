Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 21st. More than 1.38 million primary and secondary school students in disaster areas of Anhui Province have all completed the courses for the second semester of 1956. The final examinations for primary school students have now been completed, and the final examinations for secondary school students are in progress.

Between the summer and autumn of 1956, some areas of Anhui Province suffered from severe waterlogging, typhoons, and other natural disasters, which caused many school buildings to be damaged and collapsed, bringing great difficulties to students' enrollment. The state allocated more than 4.3 million yuan to help disaster areas repair school buildings. Schools in the disaster areas adhered to the principle of diligence and frugality in running schools, coupled with the teachers' hard work in teaching, which enabled the education work in the disaster areas to not only persist but also develop greatly. According to statistics from eleven counties including Yingshang, Fuyang, and Huaiyuan, the number of primary school students increased by 42% compared to 1955, and the number of secondary school students increased by more than 11%.

In order to carry out teaching according to plan, the schools in the disaster areas flexibly used various methods based on the specific conditions of each place. In August and September last year, when some places had not yet receded from the floodwaters, teachers started "water primary schools." If students were unable to come to school to attend classes due to water barriers, teachers would make rounds to give lessons. In flood discharge and storage areas, teachers moved with the student parents who were migrating and reclaiming wasteland, ensuring that schools were established wherever the disaster victims went. In order to meet the needs of farmers in disaster areas for production and self-rescue, many primary schools adopted half-day, early and late classes, on-demand teaching, and exchange classes, which not only persisted in teaching but also enabled students to free up time to help agricultural cooperatives and families with some work.

### 克服困难坚持教学工作  安徽灾区学校完成本学期的教学计划

    克服困难坚持教学工作
    安徽灾区学校完成本学期的教学计划
    新华社合肥21日电　安徽省灾区一百三十八万多中、小学生已全部学完1956年度下学期的课程。现在，小学生的期终考试已经完毕，中学生的期终考试正在进行。
    1956年夏秋之间，安徽省部分地区先后遭受了严重的内涝、台风等自然灾害，许多学校的校舍破漏倒塌，给学生入学带来了极大的困难。国家曾为此拨款四百三十多万元帮助灾区修复校舍。灾区的学校坚持了勤俭办学的原则，加上教师们的艰苦教学，使灾区的教育工作不仅坚持了下来，而且有了很大发展。据颍上、阜阳、怀远等十一个县的统计，小学生比1955年增加42％，中学生增加了11％强。
    灾区各学校为了按计划进行教学，都根据各地的具体情况，灵活运用了各种方法。去年8、9月间，有些地方积水未退，教师们就开办“水上小学”；学生因水阻隔不能来校听课的，教师们就巡回上课；在行洪、蓄洪地区，教师们随着迁移垦荒的学生家长一起转移，做到了灾民到那里，学校办到那里。为了满足灾区农民生产自救的需要，许多小学采用了半日制、早晚班、随到随教、交流上课等办法，这样既坚持了教学，又使学生能抽出时间帮助农业社和家庭做一些活。
