    Water-Sprinkling Festival – A Chronicle of Mangshi
    苗歌

    In early summer every year, newcomers to Mangshi are often subjected to sudden attacks of water on the streets. By the time you look around in dismay, holding the wet hem of your clothes, the Dai girls who splashed the water are already giggling and disappearing into the depths of the bamboo forest. At this time, kind-hearted passers-by will smile and say to you:
    "The Water-Sprinkling Festival is here! Good luck to you!"

    The Water-Sprinkling Festival is an ancient festival of the Dai people. Regarding its origin, the Dai people of the Dehong Autonomous Prefecture have this myth:

    "In ancient times, there was a demon king who did many bad things. Because he had great magical powers, no one dared to provoke him. He had seven wives. One day, he won another victory and plundered a lot of treasures and servants. His seventh wife asked him: 'Great King, water cannot drown you, fire cannot burn you, you have such great abilities, surely you will not die, right?' The demon king secretly told her that if she pulled out a hair from his head and used it to strangle his own neck, then he would die."

    "The seventh wife was a kind woman. She thought: 'He alone is causing unrest in the world, it would be better if he died.' At night, when the demon king was asleep, she pulled out a hair from his head and gently wrapped it around the demon king's neck. Sure enough, the demon king's head rolled off. But immediately the ground caught fire, and many demons and monsters rushed towards her."

    "The demon king's other six wives were very happy to hear that the demon king was dead. They hurried over and picked up the demon king's head. At this time, the fire on the ground went out, and the demons and monsters disappeared. So, the seven of them did not dare to put down the demon king's head, and each took turns holding it for a year. When the first person passed it to another after holding it for a year, it was exactly the seventh day after Qingming Festival."

    "From then on, the world was at peace. People call the seventh day after Qingming Festival 'Wan Shang Jian', and every year on this day they splash water on each other to wash the Buddha statue, helping the seven kind women wash away the blood from the demon king's head, wash away the filth, and prevent fire and disease. ..." [Note]

    Later, in addition to the elderly Buddhist believers who still piously sprinkle water to wash the Buddha statue every year, young men and women have given this festival a new meaning. They regard the Water-Sprinkling Festival as a festival for sowing love. While splashing water on each other and giving blessings, how many young men and women have seen each other's beautiful and sincere hearts reflected in the clear water! The young men's eyes are constantly scanning the girls they love; and the girls, don't be fooled by their lowered eyelashes, dodging and pretending to be aloof, in their hearts, the scales of love are busy measuring the weight of each suitor!

    However, before liberation, the Water-Sprinkling Festival was branded with the mark of disaster by the old world. The纨袴子弟 (sons of high ranking officials) of the feudal landlord ruling class often used the Water-Sprinkling Festival to insult women and create tragedies. After all, nobles and serfs could not laugh together on the same festival. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule of Han chauvinism also added to the atmosphere of terror of the Water-Sprinkling Festival. The people of Mangshi once told me that during one Water-Sprinkling Festival, several ignorant girls on the streets of Mangshi accidentally splashed water on some "officer." The "officer" was furious, cursed endlessly, and pulled out a pistol, firing several shots before swaggering away.

    It is conceivable that in that hateful era, young people could only hide their love and joy in their hearts, quietly inviting their lovers to sprinkle water in the wilderness. - Who dares to say that their sad tears were not mixed in that water?!

    Now, many years after liberation, the Water-Sprinkling Festival has truly become a festival of freedom and love for the Dai people. More and more people are splashing water, and the date of splashing water has been extended to five days, six days, seven days.... The Water-Sprinkling Festival especially attracts the hearts of girls. They dress up beautifully, carrying small buckets, twisting their waists, swaying in and out of the green bamboo forests, running around by the clear streams; laughing, teasing, never sparing any passer-by. If they suddenly find a young man from some family coming, they will run to tell each other, raise their small buckets, surround him, and splash him from the roots of his neck to the heels of his feet! At some point, the girls of Mangshi have also created a new custom: agreeing to splash water on the Party and the government to give blessings. Therefore, every year during the Water-Sprinkling Festival, the Mangshi Party committee, government, garrison, and various organs are inevitably involved in a heated water battle, sharing the joy of the festival with the Dai people.

    People say: Since the old days, the Dai people have never spent their Water-Sprinkling Festival so freely, unrestrainedly, and joyfully as they do today!

    [Note] This myth was told to me by Dai comrade Dao Baogan.

    泼水节——芒市纪事
    苗歌
    每年初夏时节，初到芒市的人，常会在街头遭到突如其来的水的袭击。等你提着透湿的衣角惊惶四顾时，泼水的傣族姑娘早吃吃笑着隐进竹林深处去了。这时，好心的行人就会含笑地对你说：
    “泼水节到啦！祝你好运！”
    泼水节是傣族的一个古老的节日。关于它的来历，德宏自治州傣族当中流传着这样一个神话故事：
    “古时候有个魔王，做了许多坏事。只因他神通广大，谁也不敢惹他。他有七个妻子。有一天，他又打了胜仗，抢掠了许多财宝和奴仆回来。他的第七个妻子问他：‘大王，水淹不死你，火烧不死你，你这样大的本领，一定不会死的吧？’魔王悄悄告诉她，如果拔下他一根头发，来勒他自己的脖子，那末，他就会死去的。”
    “第七个妻子是一个善良的女人。他想：‘他一个人，害得天下不得安宁，不如让他死了还好些。’夜里，等魔王睡着的时候，她就在他头上拔了一根头发，轻轻绕在魔王的脖子上。果然，魔王的头滚下来了。但是地面立刻起火，而且出现了许多妖魔鬼怪向她扑来。”
    “魔王的另外六个妻子，听说魔王死了，都很高兴。她们连忙跑来，把魔王的头拾起来。这时，地面的火熄了，妖魔鬼怪也不见了。于是，她们七个人就不敢把魔王的头放下，每人轮流抱一年。当头一个人抱了一年，转交给另一个人再抱时，正是清明节后第七天。”
    “从此，天下相安无事了。人们把清明节后第七天，叫做‘晚赏建’，每年都在这天互相泼水，冲洗佛身，帮助那七个善良的女人，洗去魔王头上的血污，冲去秽气，防止起火和生病。……”〔注〕
    以后，除了年老的佛教信徒，每年照例怀着宗教的虔诚泼水洗佛之外，青年男女却赋予这个节日以新的意义。他们把泼水节当做播种爱情的节日。在相互泼水祝福的时候，有多少对少男少女，从净水中照见了彼此美丽而诚挚的心呵！小伙子们的眼睛，不断朝心爱的姑娘身上扫着；而姑娘们哩，别看她们垂着睫毛，躲躲闪闪，装出一副故作傲慢的神情，其实在她们心底，爱情的天平正忙着衡量每个追求者的份量哩！
    可是，解放以前，泼水节曾被旧世道打下灾祸的烙印。封建领主统治集团的纨袴子弟，常利用泼水节日侮辱妇女，制造悲剧。贵族与农奴毕竟是无法在同一节日欢笑的。另外，蒋介石大汉族主义的反动统治，也增添了泼水节的恐怖气氛。芒市人曾告诉过我，有一年的泼水节，芒市街头几个不懂事的姑娘，不小心把水溅到一个什么“长官”身上，那“长官”勃然大怒，骂不绝口，并且掏出手枪，啪啪数响，才扬长而去。
    可以想像，在那可咒的年代里，年轻人只能把爱情与欢乐藏在心底，悄悄约自己的情人去荒野泼水。——谁敢说那水里没有掺进他们伤感的泪水哩？！
    如今，解放多年了，泼水节真正成为傣族人民自由与爱情的节日了。泼水的人越来越多，而且泼水的日期也延长到五天、六天、七天……。泼水节特别吸引姑娘的心。她们打扮得俊俏极了，提着小桶，扭着腰肢，在翠绿的竹林中晃出晃进，在清澈的溪水旁跑来跑去；嘻笑着，逗闹着，从不饶过每一个行人。要是突然发现哪家小伙子来了，她们便奔相传告，举起小桶，包围上去，非把他泼得从脖子根湿到脚跟不可！不知什么时候起，芒市姑娘又兴出一个新规矩：相约着去向党和政府泼水祝福。于是，每年泼水节期间，芒市的党委、政府、驻军和各个机关，免不了要卷入一场热烈的水战，共同分享傣族人民节日的喜悦。
    人们都说：从老辈子算起，傣族从来没有像今天这样自由无羁地喜气洋溢地度过自己的泼水佳节！
