Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 20th. The Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau will, starting this year, search for coal resources in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces needed for mine construction during the Second Five-Year Plan.

This year, the bureau will mainly strengthen prospecting work, with a prospecting area larger than the previous four years combined. In particular, it will accelerate the search for prime coking coal needed for the iron and steel industry. In addition to strengthening prospecting, coal sample collection, and laboratory analysis in the highly promising coking coal areas of Yijun in Shaanxi and Tiemai in Qinghai, the main prospecting force will also be active in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Hexi Corridor in Gansu. For the Heiyaodai-Weibei Coalfield in Shaanxi, which has already been confirmed to have abundant coal deposits, prospecting will be extended from the Tongchuan mining area as the center to both wings this year. As large-scale surveying work will be carried out here this year, prospecting personnel will be active in three-quarters of the Weibei Coalfield this year. The exploration teams, who are currently persisting in winter coal exploration in the field in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, will continue drilling in the Tongchuan mining area of Shaanxi and the Shandan and Yaojie mining areas of Gansu this year, so as to submit detailed investigation reports for five pairs of well fields and provide information on the development of the mining areas. In addition, the newly opened Shizuishan Coalfield on the eastern foot of the Helan Mountains and the periphery of the Datong mining area on the southern foot of Daban Mountain will also continue to be explored this year in order to build coal mines there as soon as possible.

Compared with last year, the workload of coal exploration in the three provinces this year requires more than doubling the area of geological and topographic surveying, an increase of more than 6,000 meters in drilling footage, and a five-fold increase in underground electrical surveying. At present, drilling work is already underway in the field; electrical surveying and coal sampling will also begin soon; and the field geological teams doing prospecting work are making preparations and will depart in March and April.

    地质人员为开发大西北准备燃料
    今年将在陕甘青三省普查煤田
    新华社西安20日电　西北煤田地质勘探局从今年起，就要为陕西、甘肃、青海三省寻找第二个五年计划建矿需用的煤炭资源。
    今年这个局主要是加强普查工作，普查面积要比以往四年还要多。其中特别是加速寻找钢铁工业需用的主焦煤。地质人员除了对陕西宜君和青海铁迈两地极有希望的焦煤区域，加强普查和煤样采集、化验工作以外，普查的主力还要活动在青海高原和甘肃河西走廊一带。对已经证实煤藏丰富的陕西黑腰带——渭北煤田，今年将以铜川矿区为中心再向两翼伸展普查。由于今年要在这里进行大面积测量工作，渭北煤田四分之三的地区，今年都有勘探人员的活动。目前正在陕、甘、青三省的野外坚持冬季寻煤工作的勘探队，今年将在陕西铜川矿区、甘肃山丹、窑街矿区继续钻探，以便交出五对井田的精查报告和提供矿区发展情况的资料。此外，对新辟的贺兰山东麓的石咀山煤田，和大板山南麓大通矿区外围，今年也要继续勘探，以便尽速在那里建设煤矿。
    今年三个省寻找煤炭的工作量，同去年比较，需要做的地质、地形测量面积增加一倍多，钻探进尺增加六千多公尺，井下电测量增加五倍。现在，钻探工作已在野外进行；电测、采煤样等工作也将在最近开始；做普查工作的野外地质队正在进行准备工作，将在3、4月份出发。
