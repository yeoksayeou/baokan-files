Yang Wenxing, who worked as a fish market apprentice and an odd-job man in government offices for over a decade and is now a steel inspector at the Shanghai No. 1 Heavy Industries Bureau, is writing a book of more than 120,000 words on steel inspection science – "An Introduction to the Method of Spark Identification of Steel." A few days ago, he completed the fourth revision of the manuscript.

Yang Wenxing is thirty-five years old this year. After finishing the first year of junior high school, he started working as an apprentice in a fish market at the age of thirteen, and later worked as an odd-job man in the steel inspection department of the puppet Resource Commission. Whenever he swept the floor, wiped the table, or moved pieces of steel, he always liked to look at its shape and color. At that time, some engineering technicians looked down on him. When they saw him learning to identify steel, they sneered, covering their noses: What can an apprentice do? He can only sweep the floor and pour tea. However, Yang Wenxing did not waver in his determination to seek knowledge. When the engineering technicians were not around, he put various steels together for research and comparison, and used a pencil to trace the shape of its surface structure. Later, he could also identify some steel.

In 1950, he was admitted to the former East China Industrial Department as a steel inspector. However, he knew too little of the theoretical knowledge of steel inspection science, and his cultural level was also very low. He did not even understand ordinary chemical principles. He was determined to advance towards culture and science. In the past few years, he has completed courses in mathematics, physics, and other subjects up to the second year of senior high school in spare-time schools, and has also used time after meals and early mornings and late nights to study more than 30 professional books on steel science, steel casting science, and steel heat treatment science. He also recorded dozens of technical materials from the tens of thousands of tons of steel materials he had inspected, next to the steelmaking furnace, on the grinding wheel, and in the warehouse. His knowledge has been continuously enriched through these diligent studies. Now, he can not only distinguish the name of steel from the flicker of sparks, but also theoretically explain why a certain steel emits sparks of this or that shape.

In the summer of 1954, in order to pass on this knowledge to the new comrades, he began to sort out his notes. He spent three harsh winters and hot summers, and stayed up more than a thousand dawns and nights. When the children were asleep, he wrote word by word; when the children were not yet awake, he started working again.

When he finished the third and fourth drafts of the book, he consulted with veteran workers in some factories on the one hand, and sent the manuscripts to metal expert Zhou Zhihong, chemical expert Zhou Zongxiang and other scholars for their opinions, preparing to continue to revise it.

    做过十多年勤杂工的杨文星写成一部有关钢铁检验学的书
    曾经做过十多年鱼行学徒和机关勤杂工、现在担任上海第一重工业局钢铁检验员的杨文星，正在著作一本十二万多字的有关钢铁检验学书籍——“钢铁火花鉴别方法概论”。几天前，他第四次修改完了这本书稿。
    杨文星今年三十五岁，他读完初中一年级以后，十三岁开始进鱼行做学徒，后来又到伪资源委员会钢铁检验部门做勤杂工。每当他扫地、抹台子，搬动一块块钢铁的时候，总喜欢看看它的形状和色泽。当时有些工程技术人员看不起他，看到他学习鉴别钢铁，都掩鼻嗤笑：学徒能做什么，只能扫地倒茶。但是杨文星并没有动摇他寻求知识的决心，他趁工程技术人员不在的时候，把各种钢铁摆在一起进行研究比较，用铅笔描出它表面结构形状。后来他也能鉴别一些钢材。
    1950年他考进了前华东工业部担任钢铁检验员。可是，他对钢铁检验这门科学的理论知识懂得太少，文化水平也很低，连普通的化学原理也不懂。他就下定决心向文化科学进军。几年来，他在业余学校里，读完了高中二年级的数学、物理等课程，又利用饭后和早起晚睡的时间，钻研钢铁学、铸钢学、钢铁热处理学等三十多部专业书籍。他还在炼钢炉旁、在砂轮机上、在仓库里，从自己检验过的几万吨钢铁材料中，记下了几十本各种技术材料。从这些勤学苦练的过程中，不断丰富了他的学识。他如今不但可从火花的闪烁辨别出钢铁的名称，而且从理论上也能讲清楚某种钢铁为啥会发出这样或那样形态的火花来。
    1954年夏天，他为了要把这些知识传授给新来的同志，就着手整理笔记了。他经过了三个严冬和酷暑，熬过了一千多个黎明和深夜，孩子睡熟了，他在一字一字地写；孩子还未醒，他又开始工作了。
    当他写完这本书的第三次和第四次原稿时，一面向有些厂里的老工人请教，一面又把稿子送给金属专家周志宏、化学专家周宗祥等学者看，征求他们的意见，准备继续修改。
