Xinhua News Agency, December 30th - In 1956, China successfully trial-produced more than two thousand new daily necessities. Not only was the quantity greater than in any previous year, but they were also exquisite, beautiful, and practical.

In the textile industry, more than two hundred new products were successfully trial-produced, including jacquard plain cloth, double-warp cloth, various blended wool fabrics, and knitwear; preliminary statistics show there were over six hundred designs and varieties. Among them, various patterned seersucker and light, thin jacquard linen are good materials for young women to make spring and summer clothing; satin jacquard fabrics are suitable for middle-aged women's clothing; various khaki and fine canvas are suitable for men and students' clothing. Jacquard plain cloth, which can be used for clothing in all seasons, can also be used for quilt covers, bed sheets, curtains, door curtains, mosquito net tops, etc. The trial-produced printed tussah silk is a new product unprecedented in history. It is brightly colored, and its color fastness to soap washing reaches level four (the highest is level five), with more than sixty patterns and more than eighty colors. This printed tussah silk can be used for dresses or bedding. A type of nylon socks that can stretch 30%-40% has been successfully trial-produced. These socks are not only durable, but the same size can be worn by men, women, those with large feet, and those with small feet. In addition, very beautiful headscarves, scarves, handkerchiefs, etc. have also been successfully trial-produced.

The daily necessities successfully trial-produced in 1956 include various clocks, watches, toothpaste, soaps, etc., along with cultural, educational, and medical supplies, totaling about one thousand items. A new type of Venus brand fountain pen successfully trial-produced in Beijing has a pen nib that is not only delicate and smooth, but also made in three different thicknesses according to consumers' different needs and habits; the ink sac of this pen is foldable and holds twice as much ink as a general fountain pen. A type of blood substitute is very useful for patients who have lost too much blood. Personnel working at sea and in the field can now use wind-resistant matches that burn for seven to ten seconds and will not go out even in force nine winds. If placed in water for two hours, they can still be lit after being taken out. There is an electric master-slave clock that can drive many small wall clocks, and it can run for twelve hours after a power outage. The daily-use ceramic products such as tea trays, teapots, and tableware that have been successfully trial-produced were evaluated by experts from the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who believe that the porcelain quality exceeds the highest level in history, and the style and images of blue and white and famille rose have also reached the highest level in history. Chinese ceramics were historically best during the Yongzheng era of the Qing Dynasty, but the porcelain successfully trial-produced in 1956 has the advantages of lightness, beauty, and practicality that were not available in history. The colors of these porcelains are sometimes dignified and elegant, sometimes simple and generous, sometimes brilliant and dazzling, and sometimes refreshing and pleasant.

Among the foods successfully trial-produced in 1956, there are more than one hundred types of canned goods, candies, cigarettes, and wines. Among them, there are large cans of vegetables, such as chili peppers and green vegetables, weighing fifteen kilograms, specially supplied to geological exploration and field personnel. They contain carbon dioxide to maintain the original shape and taste of the fresh vegetables. A type of banana flour made from bananas can be mixed with milk powder for children to eat. There are also Dunhuang and Peony brand cigarettes made from aged tobacco leaves, as well as toffee, Xiangfeizi toffee, and so on.

Shan Niang rice wine, which had been lost for many years, and cosmetics such as Ai De Shuang cream, Cold Cream, and Huali Duo Touyou hair oil, which were popular among consumers before liberation, were also restored to production in 1956.

These more than two thousand new daily necessities, trial-produced by industrial departments such as textiles, food, ceramics, and daily-use chemicals according to consumer needs, have mostly met with consumers and are very popular; the remaining varieties will be put into production one after another in 1957. Currently, some varieties are being test-marketed and have not yet been mass-produced, so they cannot be supplied in large quantities in a very short period of time.

    适应人民生活逐步改善的需要
    两千多种新日用品试制成功
    新华社30日讯　1956年我国试制成功了两千多种新的生活日用品。不但数量比任何一年都多，而且精巧美观适用。
    在纺织工业方面，试制成功的新产品有提花平布、双经布、各种混纺毛织和针织品等两百多种；花色品种据初步统计有六百多样。其中各种不同花纹的泡泡纱，又轻又薄的提花麻纱，是青年妇女做春夏季服装的好衣料；缎类提花布适合于中年妇女做衣料；各种卡几和细帆布适合于男人和学生做衣料。四季都可以做衣料的提花平布，还可以做棉被面、床单、窗帘、门帘、蚊帐顶等。试制成功的印花柞绸是历史上从来没有过的新产品，它色泽鲜艳，坚牢度皂洗达到了四级（最高是五级），花样有六十多种，颜色有八十多种。这种印花柞绸可以做衣裙，也可以做被褥。试制成功的一种呢隆袜子，可以伸长30％—40％，这种袜子不但坚固耐用，而且同一个号码的袜子，男人、女人，脚大、脚小都可以穿。另外还试制成功了非常漂亮的花头巾、围巾、手帕等。
    1956年试制成功的生活日用杂品，有各种钟表、牙膏、肥皂等，连同文教和医药用品共约一千多种。在北京试制成功的一种新型的金星牌金笔，笔尖不但细致、圆滑，而且根据消费者不同需要和习惯做出三种不同粗细的笔尖；这种笔的皮管是折叠式的，含水量比一般金笔大一倍。有一种代血浆，对流血过多的病人很有用处。在海洋和在野外工作的人员，现在可以用到一种抗风火柴，它燃烧时间达七秒到十秒钟，遇到九级大风也不灭，如果把它放在水里两个小时，取出以后还能点燃。有一种电动子母挂钟，它能带动好多个小挂钟，停电以后还能走十二个小时。试制成功的茶盘、茶壶、餐具等日用陶瓷制品，据中国科学院冶金陶瓷专家鉴定，认为瓷质超过了历史上的最高水平，青花粉彩的风格画面也达到了历史最高水平。中国陶瓷在历史上以清朝雍正时代最佳，而1956年试制成功的瓷器，具有历史上所没有的轻便美观的优点。这些瓷器的颜色，有的凝重幽雅，有的素洁大方，有的灿烂夺目，有的爽朗宜人。
    1956年试制成功的食品中，有罐头、糖果、烟、酒等一百多种。其中有专门供应地质勘探和野外工作人员食用的十五公斤重的辣椒、青菜等大筒蔬菜罐头，它里边放有二氧化碳，可以保持鲜菜的原形和味道。有一种用香蕉制成的香蕉粉，可以调在奶粉里面给小孩吃。还有用陈烟叶制造的敦煌、牡丹牌香烟，以及太妃糖、香妃子太妃糖等等。
    多年失传的善酿美酒，解放以前受到广大消费者欢迎的爱的霜、冷霜、华丽多头油等化妆品，1956年也都恢复生产了。
    这些由纺织、食品、陶瓷、日用化学等工业部门根据消费者的需要试制出来的两千多种新的生活日用品，绝大部分已经同消费者见面，很受欢迎；其余品种将在1957年先后投入生产。目前有的品种正在试销，尚未大量生产，因而在一个很短的期间内，还不能大量供应。
