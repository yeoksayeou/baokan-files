Two New Light Industrial Products

    Shanghai's renowned light and textile industries produced thousands of new and novel products in 1956. Among these, the fifteen industries under the Shanghai Second Light Industry Bureau alone, including tires, rubber shoes, clocks and watches, glass, thermos bottles, and daily-use chemicals, produced over a thousand types. Some of these new products are extremely convenient to use and better suit the needs of the people's lives. Many others were trial-produced according to the diverse needs of factories, schools, farmers, and ethnic minorities.

    两种轻工业新产品
    著名的上海轻工业和纺织工业，1956年制成数千种新的和式样新颖的产品，其中单是上海市第二轻工业局所属的轮胎、胶鞋、钟表、玻璃、热水瓶、日用化学等十五个行业就有一千多种。这些新的产品，有的使用起来极其方便，更适合人民生活的需要，也有许多是根据工厂、学校、农民和少数民族各种不同需要而试制的。
