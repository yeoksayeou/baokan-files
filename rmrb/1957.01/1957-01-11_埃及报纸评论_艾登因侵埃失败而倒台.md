Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 10th: Major newspapers in Cairo today published editorials commenting on the resignation of British Prime Minister Eden, pointing out that his resignation was a result of the failure of his policy of invading Egypt.

　　"Al-Gomhouria" said that the result of Britain's aggression against Egypt was "not Egypt's submission, but Britain's being despised; not the downfall of the Egyptian President, but the resignation of the British Prime Minister."

　　"Al-Gomhouria" also pointed out that Eden's resignation does not represent the end result of the policies pursued by the British government during his tenure. That is the policy of the Conservative Party, which is still in power. Some leaders of the Conservative Party may have disagreements on certain details of that policy, but the general direction remains unchanged.

　　"Al-Ahram" said that the significant fact is that "this is the first time that Egypt has caused a British government to fall, whereas in the past, Britain decided the fate of Egyptian governments."

    埃及报纸评论
    艾登因侵埃失败而倒台
    据新华社开罗10日电　开罗主要报纸今天都发表社论评论英国首相艾登的辞职，指出他的辞职是他的侵埃政策失败的结果。
      “共和国报”说，英国侵略埃及的结果，“不是埃及屈服，而是英国受人鄙视；不是埃及总统倒台，而是英国首相去职了。”
      “共和国报”还指出，艾登的辞职并不表示他任期内的英国政府执行的政策的结果。那是保守党的政策，而保守党现在仍然还在执政。保守党的一些领袖对于那种政策可能在某些细节上有分歧，但是总方针是继续不变的。
      “金字塔报”说，有意义的事实是，“这是第一次，埃及使一个英国政府倒台，而过去都是英国决定埃及政府的命运”。
