    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th dispatch: The Japan Labor-Farmer Party formally decided to dissolve the Labor-Farmer Party and merge into the Japan Socialist Party at its Sixth National Congress held in Tokyo today.
    In a statement announcing the dissolution of the party today, the Labor-Farmer Party said that the dissolution of the Labor-Farmer Party and its merger into the Socialist Party was to "help establish a Socialist Party government."
    According to Kyodo News, some representatives of the Labor-Farmer Party local organizations in Okayama, Kanagawa, and Kochi prefectures raised objections at the Central Committee meeting on the 15th and at today's congress to dissolving the Labor-Farmer Party and merging into the Socialist Party, believing that "although uniting socialist political forces is necessary, there are errors in the timing and method."
    Regarding the merger of the Labor-Farmer Party into the Socialist Party, the leaders of the two parties had already reached an agreement on December 27 last year. In the agreement, the Labor-Farmer Party recognized the Socialist Party's program, policies, and constitution.
    The Labor-Farmer Party was originally established in December 1948 by a group of left-wing members who broke away from the Socialist Party. It currently has local organizations in twenty-nine prefectures and approximately four thousand members, with four members in the House of Representatives.

    日本劳农党决定并入社会党
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本劳农党今天在东京举行的第六次全国大会正式决定解散劳农党，并入日本社会党。
    劳农党在今天发表的解散党的声明中说，劳农党的解散和并入社会党，是为了“帮助建立一个社会党的政府”。
    据共同社说，冈山、神奈川和高知等县劳农党地方组织的一部分代表，曾经在15日的中央委员会会议上和今天的大会上提出反对解散劳农党和并入社会党的意见，认为“团结社会主义政治力量虽然是必要的，但是在时期和方法问题上有错误”。
    关于劳农党并入社会党的问题，两党的领导人在去年12月27日就已经达成协议。劳农党在协议中承认社会党的纲领、政策和党章。
    劳农党原先是社会党内一部分左翼分子脱离社会党后在1948年12月建立的，现在有二十九个府县地方组织和约四千名党员，在众议院有四个议员。
