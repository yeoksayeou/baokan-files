Wuhan Electric Report – In the Wuhan Steel construction site's building machinery station, many cadres, amidst streamlining and economization, voluntarily applied to return to their groups as workers. The first batch of eight has been approved to return to group production.

    Among these eight cadres are the chairman of the trade union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, and clerks. They were previously excavator operators, truck drivers, and assistants with a certain level of technical skill. After being promoted to full-time cadres, they played a certain role in their work. However, due to the station's large organization and overstaffing, it was difficult for these comrades to发挥应有的作用. Therefore, after hearing the transmission report on streamlining the organization, they all voluntarily applied to return to group production.

    The station is currently studying the remaining applications and plans to approve another batch of cadres to return to group production. (Chen Mu)

    武钢八名干部回小组生产
    本报武汉电　武钢工地建筑机械站很多干部在精简节约中自动申请回小组当工人，第一批八名已批准回小组生产。
    在这八名干部中，有工会主席，团总支书记和科员等。他们过去都是挖土机手、汽车司机和助手，有一定的技术水平。他们被提拔为脱产干部后，在工作中起了一定作用。但因为该站机构庞大，人浮于事，使这些同志很难发挥应有的作用。所以当他们听了精简机构的传达报告后，都自动申请回小组生产。
    这个站最近还在研究其余的申请书，准备再批准一批干部回小组生产。　（陈牧）
