    Cleaning Up Accumulated Waste and Old Items

    To the Editor:

    I have noticed that various agencies, organizations, factories, and schools all have accumulated a lot of waste and old items.

    These things have been accumulated over many years, day after day, and are accumulating more and more. Because they are waste and old items, few people care about their storage and disposal. In fact, many of these waste and old items can be used. Some valuable old items cannot be bought on the market, but can be found in the scrap heaps of some units.

    Some items are no longer suitable for use by agencies, but are highly desirable for ordinary residents. Some, although broken and tattered, are valuable to some handicraftsmen who use waste products as raw materials.

    Therefore, I suggest that all agencies and units across the country clean up and sell all waste and old items. Doing so can make up for the shortage of materials, meet the needs of the masses to some extent, increase revenue for the country, and thoroughly remove clutter, which is also beneficial to environmental hygiene. For waste that is too dilapidated to be used, iron can be sent to smelting plants for melting, and wood can be split into firewood. Let's not accumulate them anymore.

    清理积存的废旧物品
    编辑同志：
    我见到各机关、团体、工厂、学校，都积存有很多废物和旧东西。
    这些东西都是多年以来日积月累长期积存下来，而且越积越多。因为是废旧物品，就很少有人关心保管和处理。实际这些废旧物品中，有很多是能够使用的。有些贵重旧品在市场买不到，而在一些单位的烂铁堆里就可以找到。
    有些物品虽然不再适合机关使用，而对一般居民来说则是求之不得的。有些虽然是破烂物品，但对某些以废品为原料的手工业者来说，也是宝贵的。
    因此，我建议全国各机关单位将所有废旧物品进行清理出售，这样做可以弥补物资的不足，满足群众的部分需要，又能给国家增加收入，同时还彻底清除了杂物，对环境卫生也有好处。对于过于破烂不堪使用的废物，铁质的可送冶炼厂溶化，木质的可劈做木柴，再不要积压了。　　　郑洞天
