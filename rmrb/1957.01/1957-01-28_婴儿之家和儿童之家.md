    Infant Homes and Children's Homes
    Xiao Hang
    On February 16, 1956, a rural woman in Romania gave birth to triplets, all girls. The woman, named Chifu Maria Ileana, lived in Birpaul village in the Hungarian Autonomous Region, and her husband was a carpenter. The birth of the three girls brought joy and worry to this carpenter's family. The children were premature, born after only eight months, and very underweight, each weighing just over one kilogram. They couldn't nurse and had difficulty breathing. The parents worried that the children would not be easy to raise, but they also fervently hoped they would grow into adults. So, they gave them these three names: Mariana, Madalena, Maria. All three names started with the letter "M," implying that the three of them were closely connected and would all live well. However, the children's health deteriorated day by day. After repeated discussions, the parents sent the three girls to the infant home in Targu Mures, the capital of the autonomous region. At this time, the children were only twelve days old.
    The infant home in Targu Mures received the three girls and immediately placed them in a room with a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius, injecting them with cardiotonic drugs. Then, according to the doctor's instructions, they were fed milk ten times a day by nasal feeding, half breast milk and half cow's milk. Oxygen was administered before and after each feeding, twenty times a day. At the same time, they were given a drug called "Laubolin" to help with breathing. In addition, they were given five types of vitamins. In this way, the three girls' health slowly improved. Since arriving at the infant home, they had not been sick once. When we visited the infant home, the three girls had grown to be more than seven months old. Two of the children weighed more than five kilograms, and the smallest weighed four kilograms and three hundred grams. The head of the infant home told us that the children's development was normal, and in about a year, their weight would catch up with that of ordinary children.
    In this infant home, we also saw a pair of twins—Andrei and Ivan, both boys, born on September 8, 1954. These two children were unfortunate; their mother died of illness just one year after they were born. Because there was no one to raise them, they were sent to the infant home on their first birthday—September 8, 1955. At that time, the children were quite thin; at one year old, they could only stand, not walk. A year later, on September 26, 1956, when we saw these two children, they each weighed about twelve kilograms and could both walk.
    In Romania, there are twenty-two such infant homes, averaging two to three per province, with a total of two thousand six hundred beds. The larger infant homes, such as the one in Targu Mures, have one hundred and thirty beds and sixty-two staff members, including one director, two doctors, twenty-eight nurses, and nine educators.
    Infant homes are infant care institutions established by the state, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, and accommodate children who cannot live at home for various reasons, with ages ranging from birth to three years old. A considerable portion of these children are premature. Of the more than one hundred children in the Targu Mures infant home, 30% to 40% are premature. Some children stay in infant homes for extended periods because their mothers have died or have relatively serious chronic illnesses that require long-term recuperation. We have also seen some children temporarily staying in infant homes because their mothers had temporarily gone to the hospital for surgery. Others are there because their mothers have mental health issues and cannot fulfill their obligations to raise their children. There are also a significant number of illegitimate children, some sent by their mothers, and some found by the infant home after being abandoned. In the countryside, some mothers have too many children too close together. For example, the Roma woman Vățelași Lodiga from Gherci village in Stalin province, who is not very old, already has thirteen children. If all of them were raised at home, their economic situation would not allow it, so four children have been sent to the infant home in Stalin city. When we visited this infant home, we saw Lodiga's thirteenth child, a three-year-old girl who was well-developed and very lively. All expenses for these children who come to the infant home are borne by the state.
    One principle of infant homes is to provide breast milk to children as much as possible. It is also for this reason that many infant homes have mother beds; an infant home with roughly one hundred and thirty beds will have twenty mother beds. Whenever possible, the mothers of premature babies always live here. Otherwise, feeding ten times a day would be too much trouble. Some unmarried mothers often stay in the infant home for one or two years, until the child is weaned before returning home. During this period, they also use their extra milk to feed children who have lost their mothers. The state gives them considerable remuneration according to the amount of milk they provide. The most they can receive is two thousand five hundred lei per month, which exceeds the monthly salary of a general doctor. These mothers also help the infant home clean rooms and do some odd jobs in the kitchen. All their food and accommodation expenses in the infant home are also borne by the state.
    Children in infant homes receive age-appropriate education, the content of which is the same as in general nurseries. The infant home in Targu Mures does very well in this regard. When children reach six months old, they are trained to crawl. There are many educational methods. We saw a photo: toys are placed on long steps with a very small slope to encourage children to learn to crawl. When children are one year old, the nurses often spread tablecloths embroidered with small animals on the dining table and put on brightly colored tableware to attract children to the dining table and teach them to eat by themselves. Educators teach children over two years old to recognize animals and utensils. The teaching aids are all made of wood, about two hundred or so pieces, made by the nurses in two months. There are domestic fowl, wild animals, small dragonflies, old men, and entire sets of teaching aids made according to educational fairy tales. There is also a small puppet theater here, performing educational scenes from the daily life of the infant home. Children over two years old can watch it.
    When children in infant homes reach the age of three, those who can be taken home are taken home. However, this accounts for a small number. Some children are taken in by families without children. Most children go to children's homes.
    Romania has ninety-two children's homes, which can accommodate a total of ten thousand children. Seventeen of them specialize in receiving children aged three to seven, and the rest specialize in receiving children aged eight to fourteen. Children's homes are children's education institutions, so they are all under the leadership of the Ministry of Education. Preschool children are educated in children's homes, and the educational content is the same as in kindergartens. School-age children are educated in ordinary primary schools, and they live and eat in children's homes. Some children's homes are relatively far from schools, and they are afraid that the children will be too cold walking in winter, so they have established their own primary schools. This type of school has a disadvantage, which is that it isolates the children in the children's home from children outside. The Ministry of Education does not advocate running them. After children have completed seven years of schooling, they can enter middle school. After graduating from middle school, some participate in production or work, and some enter university. All children in children's homes are provided for by the state until they participate in labor, work, and are able to live independently.
    Like the children in infant homes, the children in children's homes have a good material life. They all eat well, and they all have enough clothes. The clothes are made of wool, cotton cloth, and are for ordinary days and for festivals. Teachers care about their lives and studies like parents.
    If someone submits an application hoping to take a child from the children's home to raise, the children's home must first send someone to investigate the applicant's family to see if the family's material living conditions and moral standards are able to allow the child's body and mind to develop normally. No one is allowed to take a child home to use as a servant, or even force the child to earn money for them and exploit the child. Within two weeks after the child is taken away, the children's home often sends someone to check. If they feel that all aspects are satisfactory, then they write a formal document, which is approved by the provincial education department or the Ministry of Education, and hand the child over to a family. If it is later discovered that the family cannot raise the child well, the children's home will intervene, or simply take the child back. We visited the children's home in Timișoara, where the person in charge told us that there was a girl named Violiga who was an illegitimate child. In 1953, after she turned three years old, she was transferred here from the infant home. A local worker liked this child very much and took her home. At this time, the child was already four years old. However, this worker loved to drink alcohol and often took Violiga to restaurants. Violiga's biological mother saw this situation and was very worried about the child's development, so she suggested that the children's home take the child back. Her wish was fulfilled. In 1955, after this mother got married, she took Violiga back home again to raise her herself. There was also a six-year-old boy named Oprian Vladimir, who was taken away by a worker from Leșica City, ninety-two kilometers away, in 1955. Later, an inspector from the Timișoara Provincial Education Department passed through Leșica and discovered that this worker was not taking good care of the child. The person in charge of the children's home said that they had received this report and were preparing to send someone to investigate.
    Children's homes have a spirit of being responsible for children to the end. The teachers here regard the children as their own children. However, in the beginning, not every teacher was able to do this. Some graduates of normal schools were unwilling to work in children's homes. They did not understand this new undertaking and looked down on the children in children's homes. They said, "We came out of school to educate good children, not to educate bad children." In fact, they were mistaken. The children in children's homes generally have very good qualities. They abide by discipline and love to learn. It is just that some children who have just been sent from their families are more naughty. Now the teachers all understand the meaning of their work, and some teachers are also working hard to study their work. We visited a children's home that specializes in receiving school-age children, which is located in the Nera Semiaz village in Targu Mures. The person in charge of the children's home, Bobo Vasilie, loves his work. Based on the experience accumulated since 1952, he wrote a pedagogy for children's homes. He spread out the thick manuscript and told us about some of the chapters inside: the characteristics of children in children's homes; educating children in the spirit of socialist humanism; the educational forms of children's homes... He said that this book would soon be published in Bucharest. Teachers like this are certainly very good. However, there are also some teachers who are not highly skilled and can only take care of the children's lives, and their ability to educate children is relatively poor. The Ministry of Education is holding special lectures to improve the skills of these teachers.
    The work of children's homes is improving. In the past, boys and girls were accommodated separately. Some children's homes specialized in receiving boys, and some specialized in receiving girls. Now they are experimenting with merging the two types of children's homes, and some have already been merged. In addition, currently the oldest children in children's homes are only fourteen years old. However, fourteen-year-old children cannot yet live independently. The Ministry of Education is considering letting children stay until they are sixteen years old before leaving children's homes. At that time, the children will have the ability to live independently.
    The Romanian Party and government think a lot about children and do a lot for them. The resolution of the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party said that children's allowances will be increased again in 1957. This will surely promote new developments in children's welfare undertakings such as infant homes and children's homes.

    婴儿之家和儿童之家
    萧航
    1956年2月16日，罗马尼亚的一位乡村妇女，一胎生了三个女孩。这位妇女的名字叫奇芙·玛丽亚·伊莲娜，住在匈牙利族自治州比尔包尔村，丈夫是木工。三个女孩的诞生，给这个木工家庭带来了喜悦，也带来了忧愁。孩子们都不足月，八个月就生下来了，体重很轻，都只有一公斤多重，不会吃奶，呼吸困难。父母亲担心孩子们不容易养活，但又热切地希望她们能够长大成人。于是给她们取了这样三个名字：玛丽亚娜，玛达莱娜，玛丽亚。三个名字的字头都是“M”，暗含着她们三个紧紧地依靠着，都会活得很好的意思。但是孩子们的健康是一天天地坏下来了。在三番五次地商量以后，父母亲把三个女孩送到了自治州的首府塔古尔谟勒斯城的婴儿之家。这时候，孩子们都还只有十二天。
    塔古尔谟勒斯城的婴儿之家接到这三个女孩，马上送进了温度摄氏二十六度的房间，注射了强心剂。然后，按照医生的嘱咐，每天用鼻饲法喂十次奶，母乳和牛奶各半。每次吃奶前后，都要输一次氧气，一天输二十次。同时服一种叫作“劳伯林”的药品，帮助呼吸。另外，还给吃五种维他命。这样，三个女孩的健康慢慢地好起来了。她们自从到了婴儿之家以后，没有生过一次病。我们去访问这个婴儿之家的时候，这三个女孩已经长到七个多月，有两个孩子的体重都超过了五公斤，最小的一个孩子，体重也有四公斤三百克。婴儿之家的负责人对我们说，孩子们的发育是正常的，再有一年左右的时间，她们的体重就可以赶上一般的孩子。
    在这个婴儿之家里，我们还看到了一对双生的孩子——安德列伊和伊万，都是男孩，1954年9月8日生的。这两个孩子是不幸的，他们出生不过一年，母亲就病死了。因为没有人抚养，在他们刚好一周岁的时候——1955年9月8日，他们被送到婴儿之家。那时候，孩子们都相当瘦弱，一周岁了，还只会站，不会走。过了一年，1956年9月26日，我们看到这两个孩子的时候，他们的体重都已经有十二公斤左右，都会走路了。
    在罗马尼亚，这样的婴儿之家有二十二个，平均每省有两个到三个，一共有两千六百个床位。比较大的婴儿之家，像塔古尔谟勒斯城的婴儿之家，有一百三十个床位，有六十二名工作人员，其中一名主任，两名医生，二十八名护士，九名教养员。
    婴儿之家是国家设立的婴儿保育机关，归卫生部领导，收容由于各种原因而不能在家庭生活的孩子，年龄限定从出生到三岁。这些孩子的相当一部分是不足月的。像塔古尔谟勒斯城婴儿之家的一百多个孩子，有30％到40％不足月。有些长期住在婴儿之家里的孩子，是因为母亲死亡，或者因为母亲有比较严重的慢性病，需要长期休养的。我们也看到过一些暂时住在婴儿之家的孩子，那是因为母亲临时到医院动手术去了。还有的是因为母亲的神经不正常，不可能尽她抚养子女的义务。私生子也有相当数量，有些是母亲送来的，有些是被遗弃后由婴儿之家找来的。在农村里面，有些母亲，孩子过多过密了。像斯大林省格尔其村的茨冈族妇女沃采拉希·洛迪加，年纪不很大，已经有十三个孩子，如果都放在家里抚养，经济情况也不允许，所以先后有四个孩子送到了斯大林城的婴儿之家。我们在参观这个婴儿之家的时候，看到过洛迪加的第十三个小孩，是一个刚满三岁的女孩子，长得很好，也很活泼。所有来到婴儿之家的这些孩子，一切费用，都由国家负担。
    婴儿之家有一条原则，就是尽可能地给孩子们吃母乳。也是因为这个缘故，好多婴儿之家都有母亲床位，大致一百三十张床位的婴儿之家，都有二十张母亲床位。只要有可能，不足月的孩子的母亲，总要住在这里。否则，一天喂十次奶，跑来跑去，也太麻烦了。有些未婚的母亲，常常在婴儿之家住一两年，直到孩子断了奶才回家。在这期间，她们也拿自己多余的奶，来喂失去母亲的孩子。国家按照奶量多少，给她们相当的报酬，最多的，一个月可以得到罗币两千五百个列伊，超过了一般医生的每月工资。这些母亲也帮助婴儿之家收拾房间，作些厨房里面的零活。她们在婴儿之家的食宿费用，也全由国家负担。
    孩子们在婴儿之家按年龄受到教育，内容同一般托儿所一样。塔古尔谟勒斯城的婴儿之家，在这方面作得很好。孩子长到六个月，就训练他们爬行。教育的方法是很多的。我们看到过一张照片：在坡度很小的长长的台阶上，放着玩具，逗孩子学爬。孩子到了一周岁，护士们常常在饭桌上铺下绣着小动物的桌布，放上色彩鲜艳的食具，吸引孩子们到饭桌上来，教他们自己吃饭。两岁多的孩子，教养员教他们认识动物、用具。教具都是木制的，大约有二百多件，是护士们在两个月内作成的，有家禽，有野兽，有小蜻蜓，有老头，还有按照富有教育意义的童话制作的整套教具。这里还有一个小小的木偶戏院，表演婴儿之家的日常生活当中有教育意义的情节。两岁多的孩子，都可以看。
    婴儿之家的孩子长到三岁，能够接回家去的就接回家去了。不过这占的数量并不大。有些小孩，由没有孩子的人家领去。大多数孩子，到了儿童之家。
    罗马尼亚有九十二所儿童之家，一共可以收一万个孩子，其中有十七所专收三岁到七岁的孩子，其余专收八岁到十四岁的孩子。儿童之家已是儿童教育机关，所以都归教育部领导。学前儿童在儿童之家受到教育，教育内容同幼稚园的一样。学龄儿童在普通小学受教育，食宿在儿童之家。有的儿童之家，距离学校比较远，怕孩子们冬天跑路太冷，自己设立了小学。这种学校有个缺点，就是使儿童之家的孩子同外面的孩子隔绝了，教育部不主张办。孩子们在读完七年制的学校之后，可以升入中学，中学毕业以后，有的就参加了生产或工作，有的升入大学。所有儿童之家的孩子，在他们参加劳动、工作，能够独立生活以前全由国家供给。
    同婴儿之家的孩子们一样，儿童之家的孩子们，物质生活很好。他们都吃得很好，也都有足够的衣服。衣服有毛料子的，有棉布的，有平常日子穿的，也有节日穿的。教师们像父母一样地关心他们的生活和学习。
    如果有人提出申请，希望到儿童之家领孩子抚养，儿童之家总要先派人到申请者的家庭调查一下，看这个家庭的物质生活条件和道德水平，是不是能够使孩子的身心得到正常的发展，不许任何人把孩子领到家里当奴仆使唤，甚至逼迫孩子给他挣钱，剥削孩子。在孩子被领走以后的两周以内，儿童之家时常派人去检查。如果觉得各方面都满意了，这才写一份正式的文件，经过省教育厅或教育部批准，把孩子交给一个家庭。以后如果发现这个家庭不能好好抚养孩子，儿童之家还要干涉，或者干脆把孩子接回来。我们访问过底密索拉城的儿童之家，那里的负责人告诉说，有一个女孩子，名字叫维奥里加，是私生子。1953年，在她满了三岁以后，从婴儿之家转到这里。当地的一个工人，很喜欢这孩子，把她领回家去了。这时候，孩子已经四岁。但是，这个工人很爱喝酒，常常带维奥里加到饭馆去。维奥里加的生母看到这种情形，很为孩子的发育担心，建议儿童之家把孩子接回去。她的愿望实现了。1955年，这位母亲在结婚以后，又把维奥里加领回家去，自己抚养。还有一个六岁的男孩子，叫奥普良·乌拉基米尔，1955年被离这里九十二公里的列西查城的一个工人领走。后来，底密索拉省教育厅的一位视导员，路过列西查，发现这个工人对孩子照顾得不好。儿童之家的负责人说，她们已接到了这个报告，正准备派人去调查。
    儿童之家有一种对孩子负责到底的精神。教师们都把这里的孩子看成是自己的孩子一样。不过，在最初的时候，并不是每一个教师都能够作到这一点的。有些师范学校的毕业生，不愿意到儿童之家工作，她们不了解这个新的事业，看不起儿童之家的孩子。她们说，我们从学校里出来，是教育好孩子的，不是教育坏孩子的。其实，她们弄错了。儿童之家的孩子，一般都有很好的品质，他们遵守纪律，热爱学习，只是有些刚从家庭里送来的孩子，比较调皮。现在教师们都懂得了自己的工作的意义，有些教师并且在努力研究自己的工作。我们访问过一个专收学龄儿童的儿童之家，它设在塔古尔谟勒斯的尼拉士米亚古良乡。儿童之家的负责人包波·瓦西列，热爱自己的工作，他根据从1952年以来积累的经验，写了一本供给儿童之家用的教育学。他把厚厚的原稿摊开，告诉我们里面的一些章节：在儿童之家的儿童的特点；用社会主义人道主义的精神教育儿童；儿童之家的教育形式……他说，这本书很快就可以在布加勒斯特出版。像这样的教师，当然是很好的。不过，也还有些教师，水平不高，只能照顾孩子们的生活，对孩子进行教育的能力比较差些。教育部正在举办专门讲座，提高这些教师的水平。
    儿童之家的工作在改进着。过去，男孩子和女孩子是分开收容的，一部分儿童之家专收男孩子，一部分专收女孩子。现在正在试验把两种儿童之家合并起来，有的也已经合并起来。另外，目前儿童之家最大的孩子只有十四岁。不过，十四岁的孩子还不能独立生活。教育部正考虑让孩子们长到十六岁再离开儿童之家，那时候，孩子们就有独立的生活能力了。
    罗马尼亚的党和政府，给孩子们想得很多，作得很多。最近罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会全体会议的决议说，1957年，儿童补助金又有增加。这一定会促使像婴儿之家和儿童之家这样的儿童福利事业的新发展的。
