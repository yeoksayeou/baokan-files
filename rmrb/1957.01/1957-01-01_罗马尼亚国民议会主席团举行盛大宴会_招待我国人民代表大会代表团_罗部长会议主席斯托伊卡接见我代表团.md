Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 31st: The Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic held a grand banquet on the evening of December 29th to entertain the delegation from the National People's Congress of China and the delegation from the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

George Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Sadoveanu and Mujik, Vice-Chairmen of the Presidium of the National Assembly, Bunaţiu, Secretary, other leaders of the Party and government, and over 300 prominent figures from all walks of life in Romania attended the banquet. Also present at the banquet were Ke Bonian, Chinese Ambassador to Romania, and diplomatic envoys from other countries to Romania.

Sadoveanu delivered a welcoming speech at the banquet. He said: Representatives of our two peoples, who are fighting together for democracy, freedom, and peace, are linked here like brothers. We are very happy to have the friendship of a very strong people, and we can rely on their support. Sadoveanu said that together with the people of all other democratic countries that are building socialism, we can bring understanding to the whole world and drive the demon of slaughter and war out of the world.

Peng Zhen, the head of the delegation, said in reply that Romania is a country with a glorious revolutionary tradition, and we have personally witnessed your brilliant achievements in various fields. We have learned many useful things from you. During our visit, we have personally seen that the Romanian workers and comrades are producing boilers for power stations and oil drilling equipment for China with extremely high enthusiasm and meticulous care, and are producing tractors for the already organized, i.e., collectivized, Chinese farmers, and are always striving to deliver them ahead of schedule. Similarly, some of the industrial and agricultural products produced by our Chinese people are also supplied to Romania. This equal, mutually beneficial, and mutually supportive cooperative relationship vividly demonstrates the profound friendship and internationalist spirit between the Chinese and Romanian peoples, and vividly illustrates that your labor is for yourselves, but also for us, and the labor of our Chinese people is for ourselves, but also for you. The relationship between our two countries is like this, and the relationship between all socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is like this.

Peng Zhen emphasized that during the delegation's visits to various places, we were unspeakably happy to see Romania's prosperity, the people's happiness and joy, the increasing consolidation of your country, and the firm and correct position taken in domestic and international affairs, because your cause is our cause, your happiness and joy is our happiness and joy, and your prosperity and the prosperity of all fraternal countries and the prosperity of all peace-loving countries is the strengthening of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, which is a deterrent to the danger of war, and is a guarantee for the security and happiness of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, and is a heavy blow to those warmongering groups who vainly attempt to invade and subvert various socialist countries and nationally independent countries, and shamelessly call their criminal activities "liberation". Socialism will surely defeat capitalism in various competitions. This is the general impression we have gained during our visit, and it is also a consistent and unwavering belief.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 31st: Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, received the delegation from the National People's Congress of China and the delegation from the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, headed by Peng Zhen, at the Council of Ministers Building in Bucharest at noon on December 30th. The host and guests held talks for about two hours.

During the meeting, Stoica said that we are very happy to meet the envoys of the great Chinese people. He introduced the situation of Romania's industry, agriculture, and people's lives, and the new measures taken in these areas, and answered some questions raised by the delegation members. Stoica hoped that the delegation members would offer suggestions on Romania's work. Peng Zhen expressed his gratitude for the host's reception.

Present at the meeting were Măgheruşi and Borilă, First Vice-Chairmen of the Romanian Council of Ministers, Bârlădeanu, Voitec, and Hossu, Vice-Chairmen of the Council of Ministers, Bunaţiu, Secretary of the Presidium of the National Assembly, and some ministers of the government.

    罗部长会议主席斯托伊卡接见我代表团
    据新华社布加勒斯特31日电 罗马尼亚人民共和国国民议会主席团12月29日晚间举行盛大宴会，招待中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团。
    罗马尼亚工人党第一书记乔治乌—德治，部长会议主席斯托伊卡，国民议会主席团副主席萨多维亚努、穆日克、秘书布纳丘，党和政府的其他负责人以及罗马尼亚各界著名人士等三百余人出席了宴会。出席宴会的还有中国驻罗马尼亚大使柯柏年和其他国家驻罗马尼亚的外交使节。
    萨多维亚努在宴会上致欢迎词。他说：我们为民主、自由和和平而共同斗争的两国人民的代表，在这里像兄弟一般地联系在一起。我们很高兴，我们得到了一个非常强大的人民的友谊，我们可以信赖他们的支持。萨多维亚努说，同正在建设社会主义的其他一切民主国家的人民一起，我们能够替全世界带来谅解，并且把屠杀和战争的恶魔驱出世界。
    彭真团长致答词说，罗马尼亚是一个具有光辉革命传统的国家，我们亲眼看到了你们在各方面的光辉成就。我们从你们这里学到许多有益的东西。我们在访问中亲眼看到，罗马尼亚的职工同志们用极高度的热情细心地在为中国生产发电站用的锅炉和钻探石油的设备，在为已经组织起来的即合作化了的中国农民生产拖拉机，并且总是力争提前交货。同样我们中国人民所生产的工业和农业产品也有一部分供应了罗马尼亚。我们这种平等、互利，互相援助的合作关系，生动地表现了中罗两国人民深厚的友谊和国际主义精神，生动地说明了你们的劳动是为了你们自己，同时也是为了我们，我们中国人民的劳动，是为了我们自己，同时也是为了你们。我们两国的关系是这样，以苏联为首的所有社会主义各国的关系都是这样。
    彭真着重说，代表团在各地访问中看到罗马尼亚的兴盛繁荣，人民的幸福欢乐，你们的国家的日益巩固，和在国内、国际事务中所采取的坚定正确的立场，感到说不出的高兴，因为你们的事业就是我们的事业，你们的幸福欢乐就是我们的幸福欢乐，你们的兴盛繁荣，各个兄弟国家的兴盛繁荣和一切爱好和平国家的兴盛繁荣，就是和平民主和社会主义力量的壮大，就是对于战争危险的制止，就是全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的安全幸福的保障，就是对于那些妄想进攻和阴谋颠覆各个社会主义国家和民族独立国家，而且恬不知耻地把他们的这种罪恶活动称之为“解放”的好战集团的沉重的打击。社会主义必将在各种竞赛中战胜资本主义，这就是我们在访问中所获得的总的印象，也是一贯的坚定不移的信念。
    据新华社布加勒斯特31日电罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡12月30日中午在布加勒斯特部长会议大楼接见了以彭真为首的中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团。宾主双方进行了约两小时的谈话。
    在接见的时候，斯托伊卡说，我们非常高兴会见伟大的中国人民的使者。他向代表团人员介绍了罗马尼亚的工业、农业和人民生活方面的情况和在这些方面采取的新的措施，并且解答了代表团人员提出的一些问题。斯托伊卡希望代表团人员对罗马尼亚的工作提出意见。彭真对主人的接待表示感谢。
    接见时在座的有罗马尼亚部长会议第一副主席莫吉奥罗希、波里勒，部长会议副主席伯尔拉德亚努、沃依捷克、霍苏，国民议会主席团秘书布纳丘和政府的一些部长们。
