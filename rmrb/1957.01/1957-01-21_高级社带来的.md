What the Advanced Cooperative Brings…
　　
In Tazhuang Township, Hengshan County, Hunan Province, there is an advanced agricultural cooperative established last spring called Jing'e Cooperative, with a total of ninety-seven member households. Last summer, despite a continuous three-month drought, the cooperative still achieved a bumper harvest, with agricultural production increasing by 36% compared to the bumper year of 1955. Including income from sideline occupations, 99% of the members increased their income by 500 to 4,000 catties of rice compared to 1955. The only member household with reduced income, Zhou Zhao'e, suffered the loss of her husband, a major labor force, last year. The cooperative management committee is now helping her find ways to increase her income. Because 99% of the members increased their income, everyone in the cooperative is overjoyed and full of energy. Member Xiao Zhicai said, "This is the biggest turnaround in my life since I was born." Member Xiao Benwu, a newly promoted middle peasant, originally thought that with his strong labor and complete farming tools, joining the cooperative would not be worthwhile. After the distribution, he increased his income by more than 3,700 catties of rice. He told others, "Now I have peace of mind. The road of collectivization guided by Chairman Mao is truly an ironclad state."
　　
The fact that 99% of the members increased their income is only the most concentrated manifestation of the superiority of the cooperative. According to the members' summary, the benefits brought to them by the advanced cooperative are multifaceted. They say that in 1956, the large family of these ninety-seven households experienced "seven changes" and "eight transformations."

The "seven changes" are:

First, changing grain-deficient households into surplus-grain households. Last year, the entire cooperative not only overfulfilled the grain purchase task but also had an average of 779 catties of staple food per person, an increase of 239 catties compared to the 540 catties per person in the previous year. The households with the most had an average of more than 900 to 1,000 catties of grain per person. Even the households with the least had an average of more than 600 catties of grain per person. In the previous year, twelve households bought 5,200 catties of state-marketed grain and 2,000 catties of revolving grain. Last year, not only did no household lack grain, but even these twelve grain-deficient households had a surplus of more than 8,000 catties.

Second, dilapidated houses turned into new houses. Last year, twelve households in the cooperative repaired eighteen houses and built four new ones. The members said, "People have turned over, and houses have also turned over."

Third, worn-out clothes turned into new clothes. According to preliminary statistics, the entire cooperative made forty new cotton quilts, one hundred and eighty cotton clothes (various sizes), sixty-six sanitary shirts, thirteen woolen sweaters, four hundred and fifty-five pairs of socks, five hundred and ninety-six sets of summer clothes, and one silk dress last year. The young women, using the rewards earned by their hard work, all made colorful clothes. Members often joked, "Fake colorful clothes (referring to worn-out clothes) turn into real colorful clothes, colorful clothes, colorful clothes, colorful from head to toe."

Fourth, illiterate people turned into literate people. The entire cooperative opened three farmers' spare-time schools, with more than eighty members participating in learning. There are now thirty-six people with elementary or higher elementary school education, and the rest can recognize four or five hundred characters. For example, female member Tan Yufen, who was originally illiterate, can now record work points.

Fifth, laziness turned into diligence. Five farmers who originally did not like to work very much became actively involved in labor after joining the advanced cooperative, increasing their income and improving their lives.

Sixth, strangers turned into relatives. Ding Dongfa, a seventy-nine-year-old "five-guarantee" household with no one to rely on, was given 500 catties of grain and a set of cotton clothes by the cooperative. He was also given two catties of meat during the Mid-Autumn Festival. He happily said, "The cooperative is truly closer than relatives!"

Seventh, lean months turned into plentiful months. Last year, the cooperative simultaneously developed diversified operations while ensuring good agricultural production, with income every month and distribution every season. In the first half of the year, the cooperative prepaid more than 2,800 yuan to the members. Member Wang Zhongshi, a long-term debtor, prepaid 30 yuan from the cooperative in the first half of the year, used it for living expenses and repaid his debts, thus cutting off the tail of his debt. He said, "Who knew that the advanced cooperative could turn lean months into plentiful months!"

The "eight transformations" are:

First, transforming wasteland ponds into water ponds. Last year, the entire cooperative repaired fourteen wasteland ponds and seventeen leaky ponds, increasing the drought resistance of more than 480 mu of beach farmland from ten days to thirty to forty days.

Second, transforming small plots into large plots. The cooperative converted twenty-four small plots into eleven large plots, expanding the cultivated area by more than 1.3 mu.

Third, transforming distant fields into nearby fields. The cooperative exchanged thirty-three mu of fields with cooperatives outside the cooperative. Due to contiguous land management and the adjustment of land between teams, more than 120 mu of distant land became nearby land, which is estimated to save 306 workdays.

Fourth, transforming single-season rice into double-season rice. In the previous year, the entire cooperative only planted forty-four mu of double-season rice, which was expanded to 548 mu last year, an increase of about twelve times.

Fifth, transforming infertile fields into fertile fields. The yield of 126 mu of fields in the entire cooperative was increased from 100 to 200 catties to 420 catties per mu due to processing and fertilization.

Sixth, transforming quarrels into unity. There was a "Ma Wang Pond" in the cooperative, which the masses called the "fighting pond." Members Wang Yanben and Luo Anhe used to fight and break their heads frequently over the water in this pond. Now the pond is unified under the cooperative, and there are no more private disputes.

Seventh, transforming sparse planting into dense planting. In the previous year, each mu of field generally only transplanted 6,000 to 7,000 seedlings, which was generally changed to uniform dense planting last year.

Eighth, transforming barren mountains into forests. Originally, the mountains in the cooperative were bare, which the masses called "monk's heads." Last year, the cooperative planted more than 130,000 pine trees on the mountains, eliminating more than 360 mu of barren mountains. They are now growing well and are expected to be cultivated into forests.

The rich results and beautiful prospects make the members very enthusiastic about production. The winter production of this cooperative is doing very well, with more than 60,000 dan of fertilizer accumulated, and all the fields with water have been winter-plowed. Some members work in the fields every day and do not even go to the market. They say: The more we do socialism like this, the more energetic we become.

    高级社带来的…………
    罗仲松
    在湖南省衡山县踏庄乡，有一个去年春天成立的高级农业社叫做荆莪社，共有九十七户社员。这个社在去年夏季连续干旱三个月的情况下还获得了丰收，农业比丰收的1955年增产36％。连副业收入在一起，99％的社员都比1955年增加五百斤到四千斤稻谷的收入。有一户减少收入的社员周昭娥，是因为她在去年死了丈夫，损失了主要劳动力。现在社管理委员会还在帮助她设法增加收入。由于99％的社员增加了收入，这个社人人兴高采烈，精神百倍。社员肖志才说：“这是我出世以来的一次大翻身。”社员肖本务是新上中农，原来自以为劳力强，农具全，入社不合算，分配以后他增加了三千七百多斤稻谷的收入，他向别人说：“这下子我吃了定心丸，毛主席指引的合作化道路，硬是铁打的江山。”
    99％的社员增加了收入，只是合作社优越性最集中的表现，根据社员们的总结，高级社给他们带来的好处却是多方面的。他们说，在1956年内，在这九十七户人家的大家庭中，有“七变”“八改”。
    “七变”是：
    一、变缺粮户为余粮户。全社去年除超额完成了粮食征购任务以外，每人平均还有主粮七百七十九斤，比前年每人口粮五百四十斤增加二百三十九斤。最多的户每人平均有口粮九百多斤至一千斤。最少的户每人平均也有口粮六百多斤。前年有十二户买了统销粮五千二百斤和周转粮二千斤，去年不但户户不缺口粮，连这十二户缺粮户也有了余粮八千多斤。
    二、烂屋变新房。去年社里有十二户，修整房屋十八间，新砌了房屋四间。社员们说：“人翻身、屋也翻身了”。
    三、破衣变新衣。据初步统计，全社去年已新制棉被四十床，棉衣大小一百八十件，卫生衣六十六件，毛衣十三件，袜子四百五十五双，单衣五百九十六套，纺绸衣一件。青年妇女们，用自己辛勤劳动得来的代价，个个做了花衣裳。社员常常开玩笑说：“假花衣（指破衣）变真花衣，花衣、花衣，一身花到底”。
    四、文盲变识字。全社开办了三所农民业余学校，社员有八十多人参加学习。现有初小或高小文化程度的三十六人，其余都能认识四、五百字了。如女社员谭玉芬，原先一字不识，现在能记工分账了。
    五、懒散变勤快。有五户原来不大爱劳动的农民，参加了高级社以后，都积极劳动，增加了收入，改善了生活。
    六、疏人变亲人。七十九岁无依无靠的“五保”户丁冬发，社里分给他五百斤粮食和一套棉衣服，中秋节又送给他两斤肉，他非常高兴地说：“合作社真是比亲人还亲呀！”
    七、荒月变熟月。去年社里由于在搞好农业生产的前提下，同时开展了多种经营，月月有收入，季季有分配。上半年社里预支二千八百多元给社员。社员王中世是个老欠贷款户，上半年向社预支三十元，作了生活费又还了债，从此斩断了账尾巴，他说：“那晓得高级社还能使荒月变成熟月！” 
    “八改”是：
    一、改荒塘为水塘。全社去年修整了荒塘十四口，漏水塘十七口，使四百八十多亩滩上田的抗旱能力
  由十来天提高到三十天至四十天。
    二、改小丘为大丘。社里把二十四块小丘，改为十一块大丘，扩大了耕地面积一点三亩多。
    三、改远田为近田。社里与社外互换了三十三亩田。由于土地连片经营，队与队之间调整土地，有一百二十多亩远地变成了近地，估计要节省劳动日三百零六个。
    四、改单季稻为双季稻。前年全社只作四十四亩双季稻，去年扩大到五百四十八亩，增加约十二倍。
    五、改瘦田为肥田。全社有一百二十六亩田因加工加肥，产量由一、二百斤，提高到每亩四百二十斤。
    六、改闹纠纷为团结。社内一口“马王塘”，群众叫他为“打架塘”，社员王焱本同罗安和，过去曾经常为争放这口塘的水而打得头破血流。现在塘统一归社，再没有私人纠纷了。
    七、改稀插为密植。前年每亩田，一般只扦秧六千株至七千株，去年普遍改为均匀密植。
    八、改荒山为森林。原来社里的山都是光秃秃的，群众称之为“和尚脑”，去年社内在山上栽了松树十三万多株，消灭荒山三百六十多亩，现在生长良好，可望培植成森林。
    丰硕的成果，美好的远景使社员们生产很起劲。这个社的冬季生产搞得很好，已积肥六万多担，有水的田都已进行冬耕。有的社员天天在田里劳动，连集也不去赶了，他们说：像这样搞社会主义，越干越有劲。
