    Quoting and "Quoting Sickness"
    Wei Dezi
    The so-called quoting, as the name suggests, is nothing more than, after stating one's own opinion, quoting wise sayings and famous maxims to prove it, making the argument more convincing and persuasive. However, some quoting experts (forgive me for calling them that) are different. Whether writing articles or giving speeches, they open their mouths with scriptures and close them with classics, even when talking about love, they have to quote from various sources. They only care about showing off their magical powers, stirring up a huge wave of quotations, so that they can swim in it, show off their skills, and find pleasure in it. But others suffer unspeakably: they have to understand which are the words of the classics, and also have to figure out what the author means, but often both eyes and ears are clear, and the mind and spirit are exhausted, but still can't understand. Some articles even have quotations without proof. That is to say: quote at the beginning, continue to quote, quote again, and quote again, the whole article is quotations. What about the author's opinion? Sorry, it's hidden. At first glance, it looks like a material excerpt card. If it is really a material excerpt card, it is still useful, but it is a pity that it is out of context, fragmented, and completely unsystematic. What is even worse is that regardless of the time, place, or situation, they always quote a lot and wildly, quoting in a mess; making it completely irrelevant.
    Especially recently, quoting words from ancient books has gradually become a trend. Regardless of whether it is needed or not, even when talking about the Suez Canal, they have to rack their brains and come up with a few "Confucius said" or "Book of Songs says." I really don't understand what is the use of this? If it is said to promote the excellent cultural traditions of ancient China, it doesn't seem like it. Because even if everyone in the country wears glasses and says "One pot of wine?" or "Two pots?", learning from the bartender in "Flowers in the Mirror," the excellent culture of ancient times still cannot be promoted. If it is said to "have a source for your words," in today's era of a hundred schools of thought contending, as long as what you say is reasonable, no one will say you are "fabricating." If you quote like this, I am afraid there will only be one result—causing the price of ancient books to skyrocket.
    So, what are these quoting experts quoting for? Tracing back to the source, it is nothing more than showing off "talent" and flaunting "erudition" to show that they are "well-versed in ancient and modern times" literati and scholars. In fact, on the contrary, in the eyes of readers, they are just talentless, unlearned, and not erudite at all, just a downright plagiarist.
    This cannot but remind people of bookworms who only know how to chew books. What else do quoting experts have besides being able to read thousands of books?
    This cannot but remind people of the Eight-legged Essay which randomly pieced together some classical phrases and presumptuously called itself "declaring for the sages," what else can it produce other than some poor wretches like Zhou Jin and Fan Jin?
    I solemnly declare: I am by no means opposed to quoting. But quoting cannot be aimless, let alone replace one's own analysis and judgment of things. If you just close your eyes and fall asleep on the springboard of "quoting, quoting, and quoting again," that is not quoting, but "quoting sickness."
    Patients with "quoting sickness"—quoting experts: Hurry up and get an X-ray!

    引证和引症
    卫德滋
    所谓引证，顾名思义，不外乎说了自己的意见之后，引至理名言而证之，使之论据充足，更能服人。而某些引证专家（恕我这样称呼）则不然，不论写文章或讲话，开口引经，闭口据典，甚至谈情说爱，也要旁征博引。他们只顾自己施展神通法力，掀起万丈引证的波涛，以便游泳其内，大显身手，求个乐在其中。可是别人却苦不堪言：既要了解哪些是经典之言，又要弄清哪些是作者之意，但往往耳目并明，心神俱劳，也还是搞不明白。有些文章甚而至于有引无证。就是说：始引之，继引之，再引之，又引之，通篇是引。作者的意见呢？对不起，藏起来了。猛一看倒好像是材料摘录卡。如其真是材料摘录卡，那还有用处，可惜是断章取义，支离破碎，全无系统。更糟的是不论时间，不分地点，不问情况，总要大引特引，乱引一气；弄得驴唇不对马嘴。
    特别是近来引用古书上的话也逐渐成为风气。不管是否需要，哪怕是谈苏伊士运河，也硬要绞尽脑汁，弄上几句“子曰”“诗云”。我真不明白这有什么用处？要是说为了发扬我国古代优秀文化传统吧，不大像。因为即使全国的人都戴起眼镜，满口“酒要一壶乎”，“两壶乎”，学起“镜花缘”里的酒保来，古代的优秀文化也还是不能发扬。要是说为了“言有出处”，在百家争鸣的今天，只要你言之有理，决没有人说你“杜撰”。这样乱引下去，恐怕只有一个结果——引起古书的价格飞腾。
    那么引证专家这样引来引去，到底是为了什么呢？追根溯源，不外是要卖弄“才学”，炫耀“渊博”，以表示自己是个“博古通今”的文人学士而已。其实恰恰相反，在读者看来，也只不过是一个无才无学，不渊不博，道道地地的文抄公罢了。
    这不能不使人想起只会咬书的蠹鱼。引证专家除了能读破万卷书以外，又有什么呢？
    这又不能不使人想起胡乱凑些经义字句反自名为“代圣贤宣言”的八股文，只能弄出一些像周进、范进一样的可怜虫之外又有什么呢？
    我郑重声明：决不反对引证。但是引证不能无的放矢，更不能代替自己对事物的分析、判断。如果只是闭起眼睛，沉睡在“引证，引证，再引证”的弹簧床上，那不是引证，倒是有“引症”。
    “引症”的患者——引证专家们：赶快去照照X光吧！
