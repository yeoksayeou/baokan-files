To expedite the construction of the Yellow River water conservancy project, the Aviation Photography and Surveying Team of the Ministry of Forestry, consisting of over forty members, equipped with two aircraft and a large quantity of equipment, is actively conducting aerial photography and surveying work in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, in close collaboration with relevant units such as the Central Meteorological Bureau, the Yellow River Survey and Design Institute, and the Yellow River Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau. As of December 5th of last year, the team had successively completed aerial photography and surveying work for a total of over 10,000 square kilometers, including the expanded area of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the afforestation and greening area around the reservoir, and the construction area. In mid-December, the team commenced aerial photography and surveying work on the downstream channel of the Yellow River and the irrigation areas of the Yi, Luo, and Qin Rivers. As of December 27th, the aerial photography and surveying work for over 11,000 square kilometers of the downstream channel of the Yellow River (including the Yellow River channel from Zhengzhou to Luokou, Shandong, and the South and North Jin Dyke flood detention areas) had also been successfully completed; more than half of the aerial photography and surveying work for the three major irrigation areas of the Yi, Luo, and Qin Rivers, covering over 8,000 square kilometers, has been completed. Assuming no major changes in the weather, the team's entire aerial photography and surveying work is expected to be completed before the 10th of this month.

    In conjunction with the aerial photography and surveying work, the extremely heavy task of indoor film processing is also being carried out intensively. At present, most of this work has also been completed and sent to the Yellow River Survey and Design Institute for interpretation; some has been sent to Beijing for compilation. The entire work is scheduled to be completed in February and March of this year. To closely coordinate with this work, the Yellow River Survey and Design Institute has also transferred a large number of surveying personnel to form more than ten interpretation teams, actively conducting field interpretation work centered on Tongguan. At present, each interpretation team has gained considerable interpretation experience, laying a good foundation for large-scale interpretation work this year.

    This aerial photography and surveying work has not only completed the plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target but has also ensured quality. According to repeated inspection results, it has basically reached the level of Soviet experts. Both indoor work and field interpretation work are fully up to standard. (Zhang Guowei)

    三门峡水库航测工作进展快
    伊、洛、沁河灌区航测工作正在进行
    本报讯　为了加速黄河水利建设，林业部的航空摄影测量队的四十多个队员，乘坐飞机两架，随带大批器材，在中央气象局、黄河勘测设计院、黄河三门峡工程局等有关单位的密切配合下，积极进行了黄河中、下游的航空摄影测量工作。截至去年12月5日为止，这个队已经先后完成了三门峡水库区扩大部分、水库周围造林绿化区及施工区等总计万余平方公里的航空摄影测量工作。12月中旬，这个队又开始了黄河下游河道及伊、洛、沁河各灌区的航空摄影测量工作。到12月27日，黄河下游河道（包括郑州至山东洛口的黄河道及南、北金堤滞洪区）一万一千多平方公里的航空摄影测量工作，亦已胜利完成；伊、洛、沁河三大灌区的八千多平方公里的航空摄影测量工作已完成了一半以上。在天气无大变化的情况下，这个队的全部航空摄影测量工作，预计在本月10日以前即可完成。
    随着航空摄影测量工作的进行，极为繁重的室内冲洗整片工作，亦在紧张地进行。现在，这一工作亦已完成大部，并送黄河勘测设计院进行调绘，有的已送到北京进行编整，全部工作计划在今年二、三月间完成。为密切配合这一工作，黄河勘测设计院还抽调大批测量人员，组成十多个调绘组，以潼关为中心积极进行野外的调绘工作。目前，各调绘组已取得了不少调绘经验，为今年大规模地进行调绘工作，打下了良好的基础。
    这次的航空摄影测量工作，不仅提前和超额完成了计划，而且还保证了质量。根据屡次检验的结果，基本上达到了苏联专家的水平。室内工作及野外的调绘工作，也都完全合乎标准。　（张国维）
