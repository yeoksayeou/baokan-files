(Xinhua News Agency, January 14th) Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Gongmin reports: The year following the implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnership in Beijing's capitalist industry and commerce has also been a year of active self-transformation for industrialists and businessmen.

	During this year, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen in the city voluntarily participated in political study. According to statistics, more than 30,000 industrialists and businessmen in the city participated in spare-time or full-time political study. The content of the study included the history of social development, political economics, current affairs policies, and socialist enterprise management knowledge. Regardless of wind, rain, or snow, very few people were absent or late. In the city's forty-five centralized study and discussion locations, one could often see scenes of fierce debate over an issue, and they often examined the shortcomings in their past thinking and management style based on their new understanding after the study.

	Through their studies, they gained a deeper understanding of the history of social development and the Party's policies, strengthened their determination to take the socialist road, and the vast majority participated in socialist emulation drives alongside workers. Over the past year, in the industrial sector, more than 80% of industrialists and businessmen have participated in the competition, and the number of participants in the commercial sector is close to 90%. With the support of enterprise leaders and the help of workers, more than 8,000 industrialists and businessmen have been rewarded and commended by the government and enterprises for their significant achievements in production technology, business management, and raw material conservation, and 1,600 industrialists and businessmen have been awarded the titles of "Advanced Producer" and "Advanced Worker." Xue Yong, the private-side deputy director of the jointly-owned state-private Wuhua Medical Equipment Factory, successfully trial-produced eight complex products that had never been produced in China before, such as a muscle measuring device, a urethral dissector, and an eyeball protractor, according to medical needs. All of these products met the standards. Liu Yongxiu, a private-side employee of the jointly-owned state-private Paper Products Processing Factory, was able to save the country more than 42,000 yuan per year by improving tools, changing backward manual operations to semi-mechanical operations, and suggesting improvements to product specifications.

	The practice of socialist emulation drives has greatly changed the thinking and management style of many industrialists and businessmen. Li Xixuan, the private-side deputy manager of Tongjitang Chinese Medicine Store, was conservative in his thinking in the past and unwilling to pass on his skills. In the competition, he publicly shared all his years of accumulated experience and technology in sawing velvet antler and taught it to young workers in a few months.

    积极参加政治学习和社会主义竞赛
    北京工商业者年来进步很大
    据新华社14日讯　新华社记者卢恭敏报道：北京市资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营后的一年，也是工商业者积极自我改造的一年。
    这一年中，全市绝大部分工商业者都自愿地参加了政治学习。据统计，全市有三万多个工商业者参加了业余或脱产的政治学习。学习内容包括社会发展史、政治经济学、时事政策和社会主义企业管理知识等。他们不管在刮风下雨或落雪的日子，很少有人缺席或迟到。在全市四十五处集中学习讨论的地方，经常可以看到为一个问题激烈争论不休的场面，也常看到他们根据学习后新的认识，检查自己过去思想和经营作风上的缺点。
    在学习中，他们对社会发展史和党的政策有了进一步的认识，加强了走社会主义道路的决心，绝大多数人同职工一起参加了社会主义竞赛。一年来，在工业行业中，有80％以上的工商业者参加了竞赛，商业中参加竞赛的人数近90％。在企业领导的支持和职工的帮助下，已有八千多个工商业者因为在生产技术、业务经营、节约原料等方面作出了显著成绩，获得了政府和企业的奖励和表扬，还有一千六百个工商业者被授予“先进生产者”、“先进工作者”的称号。公私合营五华医疗器械厂副厂长、私方人员薛涌，根据医疗需要，一年中试制成功了肌肉测定器、尿道切开器、眼球突出器等八种我国从未生产过的复杂产品。这些产品全部合乎标准。公私合营纸品加工厂私方人员刘永秀，由于他改进工具，把落后的手工操作改成半机械操作，并且建议改进产品的规格，每年就能为国家节省四万二千多元的资金。
    社会主义竞赛的实践，使许多工商业者的思想和经营作风，有了很大转变。同济堂国药店私方副理李玺轩，过去思想保守，不愿传授技术。在竞赛中，他把多年积累的锯茸经验和技术，全部公开出来，并在几个月内，传授给青年工人。
