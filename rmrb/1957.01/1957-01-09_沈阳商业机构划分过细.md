    Shenyang's Overly Detailed Division of Commercial Organizations
    To the Editor:
    The number of organizational structures in Shenyang's state-owned commercial system is quite astonishing. In 1955, there were sixteen specialized companies, including general merchandise, pharmaceuticals, and coal and building materials. In 1956, nine more companies were established, including knitwear and clocks and watches. The overly detailed division of organizational structures in the commercial system not only causes a great waste of manpower and resources but also creates many inconveniences for work.
    The knitwear wholesale store under the Shenyang Department Store Company originally had only one hundred and ninety-eight people, responsible for wholesale business in Shenyang city and four suburban areas, and the work was done quite well. The number of staff quickly increased to three hundred and forty-six. Because the company's business has not increased, the number of people actually engaged in business work is still the original eighty-one. However, administrative management costs have increased more than threefold.
    In the past, large department stores of the Municipal Department Store Company directly purchased goods from the Shenyang regional wholesale station. Therefore, the supply of varieties and quantities was appropriate and timely. Now, another layer of organization has been added in the middle, which makes the procedures complicated and increases the levels, thus prolonging the commodity allocation time, directly affecting the turnover of funds and satisfying market supply.

    沈阳商业机构划分过细
    编辑同志：
    沈阳市国营商业的组织机构之多是相当惊人的，在1955年就有百货、医药、煤建等十六个专业公司，1956年又成立了针织品、钟表眼镜等九个公司。商业系统的组织机构划分过细，不仅在人力和物力上造成很大浪费，也给工作带来许多不便。
    沈阳市百货公司所属的针织品批发商店，原来只有一百九十八个人，负责沈阳市内和四个郊区的批发业务，工作做得还不错。工作人员很快增加到三百四十六人。由于公司的业务没有增加，所以真正从事业务工作的还是原来的八十一个人。但行政管理费用却比以前增加了三倍多。
    过去市百货公司大型商店均由沈阳地区批发站直接进货，因此在品种和数量上供应的都比较恰当而且及时，现在在当中又设了一层机构，弄得手续复杂，层次增多，就延长了商品调拨时间，直接影响资金的周转和满足市场的供应。焦庆永
