Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 22nd: According to TASS, King Hussein of Jordan told reporters on January 21st upon leaving Cairo that the Arab leaders' conference was of great significance for further uniting the Arab countries and consolidating their unanimity.

He said that the signing of the agreement on unity among Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan was an important event in the lives of the Arab peoples. This agreement emphasized their desire to resolve Arab issues in a spirit of unity and friendship.

When speaking about the "Eisenhower Doctrine," King Hussein said that the theory it contained, that the so-called "vacuum" in the Middle East should be filled by the United States, "is a very strange argument." He emphasized that the Arabs do not recognize the existence of such a "vacuum" in the territory where they live.

Hussein said that Israel's demand to hand over the Gaza Strip and Sharm el-Sheikh to the administration of the United Nations Emergency Force is a blatant violation of United Nations resolutions. He said that if Israel does not implement the United Nations resolution on withdrawing its troops to behind the armistice line, then the Arabs will be prepared to help Egypt and fight alongside our brothers to drive the aggressors out of Arab territory by force.

    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社开罗22日讯：约旦国王侯赛尼21日在离开开罗的时候对记者说，阿拉伯国家领导人会议，对于进一步团结阿拉伯各国和巩固它们的一致方面，具有重大意义。
    他说，关于埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦之间团结一致的协定的签订，是阿拉伯各国人民生活中的一件重要事件。这一协定强调了它们要以团结和友爱的精神解决阿拉伯问题的愿望。
    侯赛尼国王在谈到“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候说，它所包含的应当由美国来填补中东的所谓“真空”的理论，“是一种非常古怪的论调”。他强调指出，阿拉伯人不承认在他们所居住的领土上有这种“真空”存在。
    侯赛尼说，以色列要求把加沙地带和沙姆沙伊赫地区转交给联合国紧急部队管理，是对联合国决议的粗暴的破坏。他说，如果以色列不执行联合国关于把军队撤退到停战线后面去的决议，那么阿拉伯人将准备帮助埃及并且同我们的弟兄共同战斗，用武力把侵略者从阿拉伯领土上赶走。
