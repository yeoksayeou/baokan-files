    Homecoming Pact
    Wu Lü
    Some workers from the Hongfeng Silk Factory in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, who are preparing to return home for the Spring Festival, have made a homecoming pact. The contents are as follows:
    I. After returning home, take the lead in abiding by national laws and regulations, do not scramble to buy non-staple foods, eat whatever is available, and do not complain.
    II. Influence the peasants with the exemplary actions of the working class, do not eat and drink extravagantly, and do not be wasteful.
    III. Integrate with the peasants and do not put on airs in front of them.
    IV. Participate in the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers in the countryside, abide by rural order, and humbly learn from the peasants' spirit of diligence and thrift.
    V. Concentrate on production before the Spring Festival; return to the factory on time after the Spring Festival, ensuring no absenteeism or truancy. It is indeed a good thing that workers returning home for the Spring Festival pay attention to close ties with the peasants, make a pact, and prepare to do some work in this regard, and it is worth promoting.
    Returning home, no matter who it is, is eye-catching in the countryside. The people in the village want to see "what kind of person so-and-so has become after being away for a few years," the family always hopes to gain glory from it, and the person themselves always wants to leave a good impression, which is all human nature. However, what constitutes a "good impression," what is the "appearance" expected by the people in the village, and what is the glory that the family hopes for are very different. In the past, talking about these things, of course, meant "returning home in glory," getting rich, or having good luck. Now, the social atmosphere has changed, and the people's ideological awareness has generally improved, but on the specific issue of what kind of impression to leave when returning home, some people still inevitably display old ideas. In the organization where I work, there was a comrade who returned home with his wife. In order to "leave a good impression" and show that he "was doing very well outside," he had his wife wear the most beautiful clothes she had made when they went abroad, and she didn't even dare to sit on the edge of the kang (platform bed). As a result, it left the worst impression.
    Usually, when returning home, there are still those who flaunt their wealth; during the Spring Festival, according to custom, it is a time to eat better, dress better, and celebrate joyfully, so it is even more important to pay attention.
    So, are we advocating "pretending to be poor" when returning home? Not really. Flaunting wealth is not good, and pretending to be poor is also not good. The problem is that every person returning home must consciously realize that since they are a worker or a cadre, then in the eyes of the peasants, it is often not about how Zhang San is, or how Li Si is, but about how workers are, how cadres are. This requires every worker and cadre returning home to always pay attention to the impact that their actions will have on the masses, and to protect the honor of the title of working class and cadre in every small detail.
    There are many workers and cadres who return home for the Spring Festival. According to a survey in Beijing, tens of thousands of construction workers alone will return home for the Spring Festival. If so many people go home and flaunt their wealth and boast, it is easy to create a misconception among the peasants and affect their production morale. Last year, some peasants followed the workers who returned home for the Spring Festival and flowed into the cities. If those who return home can carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living, it will be beneficial to helping the peasants understand the city, understand the workers, and understand industrialization. Moreover, as written in the homecoming pact of the Hongfeng Silk Factory, those who return home can also learn some things from the peasants, make themselves more diligent and thrifty, and better carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

    回乡公约
    吴滤
    浙江杭州鸿丰丝厂一些准备回乡过春节的工人们订了个回乡公约。内容如下：
    一、回乡后，以身作则遵守国家法令，不争购副食品，做到有啥吃啥，不发牢骚。
    二、要以工人阶级的模范行动去影响农民，不大吃大喝，不铺张浪费。
    三、和农民打成一片，不在农民面前摆架子。
    四、参加农村的拥军优属工作，遵守农村秩序，虚心学习农民勤俭朴素的精神。
    五、春节前集中精力搞生产；春节后按时回厂，保证不缺勤、不旷工。工人回乡过春节，注意到密切同农民的关系，订个公约，准备在这方面做些工作，确实是件值得提倡的好事。
    回乡，不管是什么人；在乡间，都是引人注意的。乡里的人要看看“某某出去这几年变成什么样子了”，家里的人总希望借此争光，本人也总愿意留下个好印象，这都是人之常情。可是，什么是“好印象”，什么是乡里的人期望的“样子”，什么是家里的人希望的光彩，却很不相同。从前，谈起这些，当然是“衣锦荣归”发了财、走了运等等。现在，社会风气变了，人民的思想觉悟普遍提高了，可是在对待回乡给人留个什么印象这个具体问题上，有人还不免摆出老想法来。我所在的机关里，就有一个同志带着妻子回乡，为了“给人留个好印象”，表示自己“在外面过得很不错”，让妻子穿上出国时做的最漂亮的衣服，连炕边都不敢挨。结果，留下了最坏的印象。
    平常回乡，尚且有摆阔的；春节，按习惯是个吃好点、穿好点，欢欢喜喜的节日，就更值得注意了。
    那么，是提倡回乡“装穷”了？倒也不是。摆阔不好，装穷也不好。问题在于每一个回乡的人都要自觉地意识到自己既然是个工人，或者是个干部，那么在农民的眼里，往往就不是张三如何、李四如何，而是工人如何，干部如何了。这就要求每一个回乡的工人和干部，时刻注意自己的行动将在群众中产生的影响，在每一个细小的地方，都来保护工人阶级和干部这个称号的荣誉。
    春节回乡的工人和干部，人数很多。据北京市的调查，仅建筑工人要回乡过春节的，就有好几万人。这么多人回乡，如果都去摆阔、吹嘘，就容易在农民中形成一种错觉，影响农民的生产情绪。去年就有些农民，跟着回乡过春节的工人，流入城市。如果回乡的人都能够发扬艰苦朴素的精神，那对帮助农民了解城市、了解工人、了解工业化，都是有好处的。而且，正像鸿丰丝厂的回乡公约里所写的那样，回乡的人也可以向农民学习一些东西，使自己更加勤俭起来，更好地来开展增产节约运动。
