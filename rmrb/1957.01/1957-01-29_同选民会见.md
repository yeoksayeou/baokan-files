    Meeting with Constituents
    By our reporter Ding Man
    February 3rd is the day of the Romanian National Assembly election. Candidates throughout the country are currently meeting with their constituents. On the afternoon of January 22nd, we attended a meeting in Bucharest.

      In the Lounge
    The meeting was held in the 31st electoral district of New Bucharest. We made a mistake about the meeting time, so we arrived more than two hours early. The staff invited us to rest in a warm room.

    In the lounge, a young propagandist introduced us to their electoral district's candidate, a train driver named Longu who has been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. Longu has set a new record in Romania by driving safely for 500,000 kilometers. He is 51 years old this year and has worked on the railway for 33 years.

    During the break, we also met an old lady named Margareta, who was 57 years old. She told us that her grandfather participated in the Romanian War of Independence in 1877 to break away from Turkish rule. In this war, Russia helped Romania gain liberation. She said that when the Soviet Red Army liberated Bucharest, her 114-year-old grandfather, who had lost his left hand in the war, warmly embraced the Red Army soldiers with his right hand and said, "The Soviet Union is the true friend of us Romanians."

    Old lady Margareta's father and husband both participated in the First World War, and her husband was injured in the war. When she talked about her son, she couldn't help but burst into tears. It turned out that her two sons were killed by the German invaders during World War II. The eldest son died under the city of Budapest, and the second son sacrificed himself during the liberation of Berlin. This old lady, who suffered deeply from the war, finally told us that she would elect people who have contributed to defending peace and creating today's happy life to the National Assembly.

    At the Meeting
    Bucharest had just experienced heavy snow, and the snow was melting in the sunlight. Constituents hurried to the meeting on the slippery and muddy roads.

    The venue was the "Verduna" Hall, a small palace-like building. As soon as we entered, we saw the portraits of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica, and Petru Groza hanging on the rostrum, and a huge slogan written on the wall saying "Long Live the Victory of the People's Democratic Front Election". The hall had more than 300 seats, but it was crowded with more than 400 people at the meeting.

    Some of the people who came to the meeting, like us, had been waiting here for two hours. They were so concerned about the meeting, not because they didn't know their candidates, or because someone forced them to come. No, no one forced them, and they were very familiar with Longu, a nationally renowned person, and did not need to come specifically to get to know him. They actively came to participate in the meeting because they wanted to talk about their innermost thoughts and gain a deeper understanding of their candidate. Indeed, many people spoke at the meeting, and they spoke freely about what they wanted to say in their hearts.

    Sixty-year-old Boca had been waiting here for the meeting to start an hour earlier. After the chairman announced the start of the meeting, he was the first to stand up and ask to speak. He said to the young people: "I am a person who lived through the old society, and I can never forget everything at that time." When he talked about the election situation in the old society, he said that he remembered a rich man named Dumitru, who became a member of parliament by relying on his money and clubs. Boca raised his voice and said that the members of parliament at that time were either capitalists or landlords. They forced voters to vote for them, and those who did not vote for them would be beaten with clubs. He said that the current parliament is truly produced from the people. Today, we ourselves are the masters of the country.

    Old worker Carabine, wearing a black woolen coat and the gold epaulettes of a railway worker, has worked with Longu for twenty years. He introduced Longu's labor achievements in detail to everyone, and very firmly expressed that he would elect Longu as his representative. When talking about the achievements of the People's Government, he said that there were electric lights on the streets in their area, and almost every street was a well-paved, flat avenue. Railway worker Milon's son, Miron, works as a teaching assistant at the university. Standing in a corner, he said in a loud voice that he fully enjoyed the rights and freedoms given to him by the people's regime. He asked: In the past, who could have dreamed that the son of a railway worker could go to school and become a teaching assistant at a university?

    At this time, many people in the meeting raised their hands to request to speak. The chairman allowed a middle-aged woman who raised her hand first to speak. She said that she was a housewife named Chiru, and she knew everything about the candidate from newspapers and pamphlets, and she would vote for Longu. In addition, she also mentioned that in the past two years, the government has built many residences for workers and engineers in their area. She excitedly said that the living conditions of workers and intellectual workers are very good. Then it was Bulgaru's turn to speak. Bulgaru said that the government is also very concerned about people's cultural life. There are new cinemas, theaters, and parks in their area. Bulgaru has a pair of very lively eyes, and his speech made people think that he must be a young man who loves cultural and recreational activities.

    Father Pirbulescu also attended the meeting. Like ordinary old priests, he had a long white beard. He said many words praising the achievements of the new society. He said that even the enemy must admit the victory of the people. He also said that in the past, houses, land, cemeteries, churches, etc. in New Bucharest were all the property of millionaire Bazilescu. Now all of this belongs to the people.

    Everyone listened attentively to each person's speech. The enthusiasm shown by the speakers for the Party and the country, and the touching words they said, often aroused a burst of applause. The slogans "Long live the victory of the People's Democratic Front election!" and "Long live the Workers' Party!" resounded throughout the hall from time to time.

    The voters not only talked about the achievements, but also kindly pointed out the errors and shortcomings in the work, and at the same time put forward some suggestions for future work.

    Housewife Chiru criticized that there was a lack of food stores near the staff and worker residences, which added some difficulties for the staff and workers and housewives. She suggested that the government solve this problem. Mertelginanu, who works at a school, asked for more gas to be supplied to their school and asked for help in building sewers for the school. Dumitrescu is a worker at the "Mao Zedong Factory". He lives in a new worker's residence, but the laundry room in the new residence has not been repaired yet. He hoped that Longu, the representative he was about to elect, would help him solve the difficulty of washing clothes.

    Longu, with graying hair, sat on the rostrum, and the five-star Hero Medal gleamed on his chest. He listened attentively and kept noting everyone's opinions.

    After the vice chairman of the district people's congress answered some of the questions raised by everyone, Longu smiled and stood up modestly and said: "Under the leadership of the Party, we have achieved great achievements. These achievements are our guarantee for overcoming difficulties. With the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the people throughout the country, we will achieve even greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction."

    同选民会见
    本报记者　丁曼
    2月3日是罗马尼亚国民议会选举的日子。现在全国各地的候选人正在同选民们见面。1月22日的过午，我们在布加勒斯特参加了一次会见会。
      在休息室
    这次会见是在新布加勒斯特的第三十一号选区召开的。我们搞错了开会时间，所以早到会两个多钟头。工作人员邀我们到一个温暖的房间里休息。
    在休息室里，一位年轻的宣传员向我们介绍说，他们这个选区提出的候选人是个获得社会主义劳动英雄称号的火车司机，名叫隆古。隆古在罗马尼亚创造了安全行车五十万公里的新纪录。他今年五十一岁，已经在铁路上工作了三十三年。
    趁休息的机会，我们还认识了一位姓马尔加列达的五十七岁的老太太。她告诉我们，她祖父参加过1877年罗马尼亚争取脱离土耳其统治的独立战争。在这次战争中，俄罗斯帮助罗马尼亚获得了解放。她说，当苏联红军解放布加勒斯特的时候，她的一百一十四岁的、在战争中失掉了左手的祖父，用右手热烈地拥抱红军战士，并且说：“苏联是我们罗马尼亚人的真正朋友。”
    马尔加列达老太太的父亲和丈夫都参加过第一次世界大战，她丈夫曾经在战争中受伤。她向我们谈到她儿子时，竟止不住地掉眼泪。原来她的两个儿子都是在第二次世界大战时被德寇打死的。大儿子死在布达佩斯城下，二儿子在解放柏林的时候牺牲。这位深受战争折磨的老太太最后告诉我们说，她要选举对保卫和平、对创造今天的幸福生活有功劳的人到国民议会去。
    在会见会上
    布加勒斯特刚刚下过大雪，雪在阳光下溶化着，选民们在又滑又泥泞的路上赶来开会。
    会场是个小皇宫似的“弗尔杜那”礼堂。我们一进门就看到主席台上悬挂着的乔治乌—德治、斯托伊卡和格罗查的画像，看到墙壁上写着“人民民主阵线选举胜利万岁”的巨幅标语。礼堂内有三百多个座位，但在开会时挤满了四百多人。
    来开会的人中间，有的也像我们一样在这里等了两个钟头。他们如此关心会见，并不是因为他们不认识他们的候选人，或者有人强迫他们来。不，没有一个人强迫他们，而他们对隆古这位闻名全国的人也很熟悉，用不着专门来和他认识。他们积极地来参加会见，是想谈谈自己的心事，想和他们的候选人取得进一步的了解。的确，会上有很多人发言，他们无拘无束地讲出了自己心里想说的话。
    六十多岁的保卡，早在一小时以前就在这里等着开会了。主席宣布开会后，他第一个站起来要求说话。他向青年们说：“我是从旧社会里生活过来的人，我永远不能忘记那时候的一切。”他在谈到旧社会的选举情形时说，他记得有个叫杜米特鲁的大富豪，靠着他的金钱和棍子当了议员。保卡提高嗓子说，那时的议员不是资本家就是地主。他们强迫选民投他们的票，不投他们的票就要挨棍子。他说，现在的议会真正是从人民中产生的。今天国家的主人是我们自己。
    身穿黑色呢大衣、带着铁路员工的金黄色肩章的老工人卡拉宾已和隆古一起工作了二十年。他详细地向大家介绍了隆古的劳动功绩，并且十分坚决地表示，他将选举隆古作自己的代表。在谈到人民政府的成就时，他说，在他们那个地区的街道上都有了电灯，差不多每条街都是铺砌得很好的平坦大道。铁路工人的儿子米隆，在大学当助教。他站在一个角落里，用洪亮的声音说，他充分地享受了人民政权给他的权利和自由。他问道：在从前，谁能梦想到一个铁路工人的儿子可以上学，并且能在大学里当助教呢？
    这时会场上有很多人举手要求发言。主席让一个先举手的中年妇女讲话。她说她是家庭主妇，名叫基鲁，从报纸和小册子中知道了候选人的一切，她将把票投给隆古。另外她还谈到，最近两年来，政府在她们这个区为工人、工程师修建了很多住宅。她兴奋地说，工人和劳动知识分子的居住条件是很好的。接着轮到布尔加库发言。布尔加库说政府也很关心人民的文化生活。在他们这个地区有了新的电影院、戏院和公园。布尔加库有一对十分活泼的眼睛，他的发言使人想到他一定是个热爱文娱活动的小伙子。
    神父彼尔布列斯库也参加了会见会。他和一般的年老的神父一样，留着一嘴很长的白胡须。他说了很多赞扬新社会的成就的话。他说即使敌人也得承认人民的胜利。他又说，从前在新布加勒斯特的房屋、土地、墓地、教堂等，都是百万富翁巴兹列斯库的财产。现在这一切，已经全部人民所有了。
    大家凝神地倾听着每个人的发言。发言人对党、国家所表现的热诚和所说的打动人心的话，常常引起一片掌声。“人民民主阵线选举胜利万岁！”“工人党万岁！”的口号声不时响彻大厅。
    选民们不仅讲到了成就，他们也善意地指出了工作中所存在的错误和缺点，同时对今后的工作提出了一些建议。
    家庭主妇基鲁批评说，在职工住宅附近缺乏食品商店，给职工和家庭主妇增加了一些困难。她建议政府解决这一问题。麦尔特日尼亚努在学校工作，他要求供给他们学校更多的煤气，要求帮助学校修建下水道。杜米特列斯库是“毛泽东工厂”的工人，他住在新的工人住宅，但新住宅的洗衣房还没修好。他希望他将要选举的代表隆古帮助他解决洗衣服的困难。
    头发斑白的隆古坐在主席台上，五星英雄勋章在他的胸前闪着金色的光芒。他侧耳静听，不停地记下大家的意见。
    在区人民会议副主席解答了大家所提出的一些问题以后，隆古微笑着，谦逊地站起来说：“我们在党的领导下获得了很大的成就，这些成就是我们克服困难的保证。有党的领导和全国人民的努力，我们在社会主义建设事业中将要获得更大的成就。”
      （1月24日于布加勒斯特）
