    We Cannot Let Them Go Hungry and Cold
    In order to support the nation's busy transportation tasks, the members of our agricultural cooperative, under the leadership of the Qingdao City Laoshan District Transportation Section, transferred sixty-one horse-drawn carts to participate in transportation work in the Liuting area last May. We are a transportation force, but when we encounter difficulties, no one cares. The accommodation problem has not been resolved, and in winter we are still sleeping in the streets. We don't return to Liuting to stay until eight or nine o'clock in the evening, and by then we cannot get any food. According to the regulations of the District Transportation Section, each person is subsidized one yuan per day. However, some agricultural cooperatives subsidize eight jiao, some six jiao, and some provide no subsidy at all. Consequently, some cart drivers only receive ten work points, which is not enough to eat. Because of these reasons, the cart drivers have many complaints, their work morale is low, and more and more are asking to return home to engage in agricultural production, which seriously affects the completion of the transportation tasks.
    The above problems have been repeatedly reported to the Transportation Section and relevant departments, but they always say "there is no way." Is there really no way? Can we just watch them freeze and starve without doing anything? We urgently hope that this problem can be solved as soon as possible to facilitate the completion of the transportation tasks.

### 不能让我们挨饿受冻

    不能让我们挨饿受冻
    我们农业社的社员为了支援国家繁忙的运输任务，去年5月在青岛市崂山区交通科的领导下，曾调出马车六十一部，参加流亭地区的运输工作。我们是一支运输力量，然而遇到了困难却没有人过问。住宿问题一直未能解决，冬天仍然露宿街头，晚上八九点钟才赶着马车回流亭住宿，这时饭也吃不上。按照区交通科的规定，每人每天补助一元。但有的农业社补助八角，有的补助六角，有的根本没有补助，故有的马车工人仅得了十个工分，根本不够吃。由于这些原因，马车工人意见很多，工作情绪低落，要求回家生产的愈来愈多，严重地影响着运输任务的完成。
    上述的问题，虽然一再向交通科和有关部门反映过，但他们总说“没办法”。难道真的没有办法吗？能眼看他们受冻挨饿而不管吗？我们迫切地希望能早日解决这个问题，以利于运输任务的完成。
