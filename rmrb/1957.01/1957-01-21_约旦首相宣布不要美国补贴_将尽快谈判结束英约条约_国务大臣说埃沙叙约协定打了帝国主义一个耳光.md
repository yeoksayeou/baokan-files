Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 20th: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi announced in Cairo on the evening of the 19th that Jordan would contact Britain as soon as possible to end the British-Jordanian treaty.

Nabulsi said he did not want subsidies from the United States. He said that if U.S. subsidies were to replace British subsidies, it would be tantamount to changing from one master to another.

Irsheidat, the head of the Jordanian government delegation participating in financial aid negotiations in Cairo, and also the Jordanian Minister of Education and Justice, said on the 19th that the agreement reached between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria with Jordan on financial aid was "the most fatal blow to imperialism dealt by Arab nationalism after its defeat in Port Said."

Xinhua News Agency, January 20th dispatch from Cairo: Jordanian Minister of State Rimawi said in Cairo on the 19th that the agreement on financial aid to Jordan from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria will be a cornerstone in the great edifice of Arab free nationalism.

Referring to the relationship between the agreement signed by the Arab countries and the United States, Rimawi said: "If the United States attempts to isolate any Arab country from its neighbors, it would be terribly wrong. Washington should understand from today's agreement that our four Arab countries are firmly united and cannot be separated from each other."

Rimawi also pointed out: "This agreement is a slap in the face to imperialism, and it was signed precisely when the sinister, conspiratorial, and imperialist forces were meeting in Ankara."

Rimawi also said: Historically, Western imperialists drew a line at the Suez Canal, and they have always wanted to use this method to divide the Arab world. Rimawi said, "They tried to say that the Arab countries of Asia are not one nation with Egypt, and that the Arabs of North Africa constitute a third group. Our agreement today proves that this statement is absurd because this agreement unites the Arabs of Asia with the Arabs of Africa. In the end, we will certainly become a completely united Arab nation."

    约旦首相宣布不要美国补贴
    将尽快谈判结束英约条约
    国务大臣说埃沙叙约协定打了帝国主义一个耳光
    据新华社开罗20日电　约旦首相纳布西19日晚上在开罗宣布，约旦将尽快地同英国进行接触，以结束英国—约旦条约。
    纳布西说，他不愿意从美国得到补贴。他说，如果以美国的补贴来代替英国的补贴，那就等于从一个主子换成另外一个主子。
    在开罗参加财政援助谈判的约旦政府代表团团长、约旦教育和司法大臣伊尔舍达特19日说，埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚就财政援助问题同约旦达成的协议，是“帝国主义在塞得港遭到失败以后阿拉伯民族主义给它的最致命的打击”。
    据新华社20日讯　开罗消息：约旦国务大臣里马维19日在开罗说：埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚给约旦财政援助的协定，将是阿拉伯自由民族主义巨大建筑物的一块基石。
    里马维在谈到阿拉伯国家签订的这项协定同美国的关系时说：“如果美国企图使任何阿拉伯国家离开它的邻国而孤立起来，那就大错而特错了。华盛顿应当从今天的协定中了解到，我们四个阿拉伯国家是牢固地团结在一起的，是不能够彼此被隔离开的。”
    里马维还指出：“这项协定打了帝国主义一个耳光，而且它正好是在罪恶的、阴谋的和帝国主义的力量在安卡拉举行会议的时候签订的。”
    里马维还说：从历史上看来，西方帝国主义者在苏伊士运河上划了一条界线，他们一直要用这种办法来分化阿拉伯世界。里马维说：“他们企图说，亚洲的阿拉伯国家同埃及不是一个民族，而北非的阿拉伯人另外构成第三个集团。我们今天的协定证明这种说法是荒谬的，因为这个协定把亚洲的阿拉伯人同非洲的阿拉伯人结合在一起。最后我们一定成为一个完全团结一致的阿拉伯民族。”
