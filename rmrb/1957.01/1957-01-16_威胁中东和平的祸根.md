	The Root of the Threat to Peace in the Middle East
	The Egyptian government formally requested on January 11 that the United Nations General Assembly convene a special session to discuss Israel's delay in withdrawing its troops from Egyptian territory. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi warned that the continued presence of Israeli aggression troops on Egyptian territory would only lead to further deterioration of the situation and "extremely serious consequences."
	More than two months have passed since the Anglo-French-Israeli war of aggression against Egypt was forced to a halt. The United Nations General Assembly has adopted several resolutions demanding the withdrawal of all aggressor troops from Egyptian territory. Now, while the Anglo-French aggressor troops have been forced to withdraw from Port Said, the Israeli troops have been delaying their withdrawal from Egyptian territory again and again. On January 12, Israeli Interior Minister Bar-Yehuda even openly declared that Israel could not withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula again. At the same time, the Israeli aggressor troops are carrying out frenzied destruction in the occupied areas and persecuting Egyptian residents with inhumanity. Israel's open contempt for UN resolutions and continued actions threatening peace in the Middle East cannot be tolerated by all peace-loving people.
	Israel's daring to delay its withdrawal from Egypt, just as it dared to launch a war of aggression against Egypt, is due to the support of imperialists behind the scenes. It is no secret that Britain and France, when forced to withdraw their aggressor troops, attempted to continue using Israel to violate Egypt's sovereignty. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd had long advocated that Egypt's Gaza Strip be placed "under the responsibility of the United Nations," and French Foreign Minister Pineau had also declared that "the Israeli-Arab dispute cannot be resolved on the basis of the 1949 armistice agreement," while some newspapers in London have been clamoring for certain areas of Egyptian territory to be turned into "permanent international zones," all of which is blatant encouragement for Israel to delay its withdrawal.
	Similarly, the United States is also instigating Israel to delay its withdrawal in order to achieve its selfish goals. The United States clearly wants to use this to pressure Egypt to make concessions on the Suez Canal issue and to implement the so-called "international solution" planned by Dulles. At the same time, in order to facilitate the promotion of the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive plan in the Middle East, the United States is trying to complicate the Israeli-Arab dispute. According to an AFP report on January 2, after the "Eisenhower Doctrine" came out, the United States will take measures to "strengthen the Baghdad Pact" and "establish a security zone between Israel and Arab countries." Its specific approach is to "place the Gaza Strip under UN administration, demilitarize the narrow strip of land along the Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula, and demilitarize Tiran Island at the entrance to Elath and the Gulf of Aqaba." The United States clearly wants to keep the Israeli-Arab dispute unresolved in order to exacerbate the tension in the Middle East.
	Therefore, it is not difficult to see that Israel's delay in withdrawal is a root of trouble deliberately left on Egyptian territory by the US, British, and French Western colonial countries. Although they have different intentions and different plans, their purpose is to harm the sovereign interests of Egypt and Arab countries and continue to threaten peace in the Middle East.
	The people of Egypt and the Middle East clearly see through these conspiracies and tricks of the Western colonial countries. The Egyptian people have issued warnings, expressing that they cannot tolerate the long-term existence of this situation that violates their national territory and sovereign integrity. Other Arab countries have firmly expressed their support for Egypt's just position. Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali announced that Syria fully supports Egypt's warning that Israeli troops must withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. The Political Committee of the Arab League has also issued a resolution demanding Israel's unconditional withdrawal. Representatives of Asian and African countries in the United Nations have decided to demand that the United Nations General Assembly quickly discuss this urgent issue. Needless to say, the Chinese people and other peace-loving people fully support these efforts that are conducive to peace in the Middle East.
	In order to safeguard the sovereignty of Egypt and Arab countries, and for the peace of the Middle East, the Israeli aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from Egypt, and the root of trouble that remains on Egyptian territory, violating Egyptian sovereignty and threatening peace in the Middle East, must be eradicated immediately. The United Nations should earnestly take responsibility, safeguard the dignity of UN resolutions, and have the UN forces force the Israeli aggressor troops to immediately, completely, and unconditionally get out of Egypt.

### 威胁中东和平的祸根

    威胁中东和平的祸根
    埃及政府已于1月11日正式要求联合国大会召开特别会议，讨论以色列拖延从埃及领土上撤军的问题。埃及外交部长法齐在致联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的函件中警告说，以色列侵略军队的继续留在埃及领土上，只会引起局势进一步的恶化和“极端严重的后果”。
    英法和以色列侵略埃及的战争被迫停止以来，已经两个多月过去了。联合国大会曾几次作出决议，要求一切侵略军从埃及的领土上撤出去。现在，英法侵略军虽已被迫撤离了塞得港，但是以色列军队却一拖再拖，不肯从埃及的领土上滚出去。1月12日，以色列的内政部长巴尔—耶胡特甚至公然宣称，以色列不能从西奈半岛再撤退。同时，以色列侵略军还在占领区进行疯狂的破坏，并对埃及居民进行灭绝人性的迫害。以色列的这种公然蔑视联合国决议、继续威胁中东和平的行为，是一切爱好和平的人民所决不能容许的。
    以色列敢于拖延从埃及撤军，正如它敢于对埃及发动侵略战争一样，是受到帝国主义者在幕后的支持。英国和法国在被迫撤出侵略军的时候，就力图继续利用以色列来侵犯埃及的主权，这已经不是什么秘密了。英国外交大臣劳埃德早就主张要把埃及的加沙地带交“由联合国负责”，法国外交部部长比诺也曾声言“以色列—阿拉伯纠纷不可能在1949年停战协定的基础上获得解决”，而伦敦的一些报纸一直在叫嚷要把埃及的领土的某些地方变成“永久性的国际地带”，这都是对以色列拖延撤军的公然鼓励。
    同样，美国也正在怂恿以色列拖延撤军，以达到它的自私目的。美国显然想借此压迫埃及，要埃及在苏伊士运河问题上让步，实现杜勒斯策划出来的所谓“国际解决办法”。同时，美国为了便于它在中东地区推销所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划，正力图使以阿纠纷更加复杂化。据法新社1月2日透露：“艾森豪威尔主义”出来以后，美国将采取措施“加强巴格达条约”，并“在以色列和阿拉伯各国之间建立一个安全区”。它的具体作法就是“使加沙地区归联合国管理，使西奈半岛沿以色列边境的狭长地带非军事化和艾尔契克角和亚喀巴湾的进口处蒂朗岛非军事化”。美国显然是要使以阿纠纷继续不得解决，以加剧中东地区的紧张局势。
    因此，不难看出，以色列的拖延撤军，乃是美、英、法西方殖民国家故意在埃及领土上留下的一个祸根，它们虽然各怀鬼胎，各有打算，但是目的都是要危害埃及和阿拉伯国家的主权利益，继续威胁中东的和平。
    西方殖民国家这种阴谋诡计，埃及和中东国家人民是看得清楚的。埃及人民已经发出了警告，表示他们不能容忍这种侵犯他们国家的领土和主权完整的情况的长期存在，其它阿拉伯国家坚决表示了对埃及这一正义立场的支持。叙利亚总理阿萨利宣布，叙利亚全力支持埃及关于要以色列军队从西奈半岛和加沙地区撤退的警告。阿拉伯联盟政治委员会也发表决议要以色列无条件撤军。联合国中的亚非国家的代表已决定要求联合国大会迅速讨论这一紧急问题。不待说，中国人民和其它爱好和平国家人民是充分支持这些有利于中东和平的努力的。
    为了维护埃及和阿拉伯国家的主权，为了中东的和平，以色列侵略军必须立即撤出埃及，留在埃及领土上侵犯埃及主权和威胁中东和平的祸根必须立即铲除。联合国应该切实地负起责任来，维护联合国决议的尊严，要联合国部队迫使以色列侵略军立即全部和无条件地滚出埃及去。
