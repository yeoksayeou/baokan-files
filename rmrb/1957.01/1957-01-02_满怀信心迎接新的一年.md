    President Pieck Delivers New Year's Address
    The Main Task of the New Year is to Guarantee Peace. The German Democratic Republic Resolutely Pursues a Policy of Peaceful Resolution of International and Internal German Disputes
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 1st: According to the German News Agency, President Wilhelm Pieck of the German Democratic Republic said in his New Year's address that the year 1956 was marked by significant achievements in the cause of peace. The aggression against Egypt by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, as well as the riots planned by Horthy fascists and other counter-revolutionaries to subvert the Hungarian people's regime, had threatened humanity with a third world war. However, thanks to the concerted efforts of socialist countries and peace-loving countries, this danger was extinguished. The firm stance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as the full mobilization of peace forces, restored peace to Europe and the Near East on the eve of the New Year. This is the most significant victory for peace-loving people in the past year.

    Pieck pointed out that guaranteeing peace is also the most important task of the new year. We must unite all forces and heighten our vigilance to fight back against those who threaten peace in Germany, thereby threatening world peace.

    Pieck said that the German Democratic Republic will implement one measure after another to improve the lives of people of all strata. In addition to the measures that have already been implemented to improve the material and cultural standards of the working people, working hours will be shortened, and the rights of workers in socialist enterprises will be expanded.

    Pieck went on to point out that peace and creative labor are the most important and indispensable prerequisites for continuing to improve welfare. Therefore, in the new year, the German Democratic Republic will continue to pursue a policy of negotiation and mutual understanding in all international and internal German disputes.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 1st: Radio Tirana broadcast yesterday Albanian Council of Ministers Chairman Shehu's answers to questions raised by the Albanian News Agency regarding the achievements of the Republic in 1956 and the prospects for 1957.

    Shehu said that according to preliminary materials, the output of industrial products in 1956 increased by 7% compared with the level of 1955. Among them, oil extraction increased by 31%, power generation increased by 21%, the production of building materials increased by 51%, and the total output of the food industry increased by 26%. During this year, some important industrial enterprises such as oil refineries and canning factories were built.

    Great achievements have also been made in the development of agriculture. At the end of 1955, we had only 318 cooperatives, but now the number of cooperatives has increased to 850. The socialist component in agriculture now owns 40% of the country's cultivated land.

    Shehu pointed out that the Party and the government took several important measures in 1956 aimed at further improving the welfare of the working people.

    Shehu said that due to the peaceful policy pursued by our government, the international position of the People's Republic of Albania has been strengthened. Albania maintains diplomatic relations with twenty countries. The unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp has been and remains the cornerstone of our foreign policy.

    Our Party and government believe that the ideological unity of the socialist camp based on Marxist-Leninist principles is the decisive factor in developing socialism and safeguarding world peace.

    When talking about the tasks for 1957, Shehu pointed out that according to the plan, industrial production in 1957 will increase by 24% compared with 1956. The Albanian government will do everything possible to improve relations with Yugoslavia, Italy, and Greece.
