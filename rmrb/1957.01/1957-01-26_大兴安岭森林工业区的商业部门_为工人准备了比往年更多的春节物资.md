Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, January 24th: This year, the Spring Festival goods prepared by the stores in the Greater Khingan Range Forest Industrial Area are more abundant than in any previous year. The shelves are full of goods, and the warm cellars and warehouses, and even the courtyards, are piled with various New Year's goods. The stores have prepared more than 670,000 catties of pork, beef, and mutton, and more than 300,000 catties of fish and shrimp. Fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, chives, and celery, newly shipped from Guangdong, have also begun to be sold in the forest cities. Sea cucumber, pheasant, crab meat, dried scallops and other delicacies, as well as various wines and candies, have also appeared on the counters. Hazelnuts produced locally, peanuts and melon seeds transported from afar, oranges from the south, apples from the northeast, and Ya pears and chestnuts produced in Hebei Province have also been shipped in. Some stores have transferred floral fabrics and children's cloaks from other places for women and children. Some stores have also added firecrackers and five or six hundred kinds of children's toys.

    The person in charge of the commercial department of the Greater Khingan Range Forest Industrial Area said that in order to enable employees to have a good Spring Festival, commercial companies sent people to purchase New Year's goods in all directions as early as a month ago. Due to the deep concern of the commercial departments in the interior for the lives of the builders in the forest area, they gave up some of the essential commodities of their own departments, making the Spring Festival supplies in the forest area this year more than 30% more than last year, and the variety has also greatly increased compared to the past.

    为工人准备了比往年更多的春节物资
    据新华社海拉尔24日电　今年大兴安岭森林工业区各商店准备的年货比以往任何一年都丰富。货架上货物满满的，暖窖和仓库里，甚至庭院中也堆满了各种年货。各商店准备的猪牛羊肉有六十七万多斤，鱼虾三十多万斤。新由广东运到的西红柿、韭菜、芹菜等七、八种鲜菜也开始在森林城市出售。海参、野鸡、蟹肉、干贝等山珍海味和各种酒类、糖果也在柜台上出现了。当地盛产的榛子，远途运来的花生和瓜子，南方的桔子、东北的苹果、河北省出产的鸭梨和栗子也都运到了。有的商店从外地为妇女和儿童调来了花布和小孩斗篷。有的商店还新添了鞭炮和五、六百种儿童玩具。
    大兴安岭森林工业区的商业部门负责人说，为使职工过好春节，各商业公司早在一个月以前就派人四出采购年货。由于内地商业部门深切关怀林区建设者的生活，出让了自己部门一部分必备的商品，使得今年林区春节物资比去年多30％以上，品种也比过去大大增加。
