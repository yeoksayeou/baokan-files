Tangshan City's Various Academic Societies
Actively Carry Out Academic Activities

    (Our Dispatch) Since the establishment of the Tangshan City Science Association in Hebei Province in October of last year, academic activities in Tangshan City have gradually become more active. By the end of December, the city had ten academic societies, including the Civil Engineering Society, the Mechanical Engineering Society, the Electrical Engineering Society, the Coal Mining Engineering Society, the Chemical Society, the Metal Society, the Medical Society, the Physics Society, the Mathematics Society, and the Textile Society (which is currently still a group). There are more than six hundred registered members, distributed in major factories, mines, hospitals, schools and other units throughout the city.
    After the establishment of the various specialized societies, scientific workers began to advance towards specialized scientific fields. So far, the Medical Society has been the most active. This society has organized five academic report meetings. The report contents included: "Focus Clearance of Spinal Tuberculosis," "Glaucoma," "Bone Marrow Transfusion," "Acute Arterial Injury," and others. Other societies are also actively engaged. The Electrical Engineering Society and the Mechanical Engineering Society have held one to two academic report meetings each. The Coal Mining Engineering Society has also held report meetings, with the report contents including: "Hydrogeology and Alluvial Structure of Linxi Coal Mine," "The Problem of Leaving Coal Pillars Under Alluvial Layers," "Hydrogeological Conditions of Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine."
    In their march towards science, scientific workers throughout the city pay special attention to the issue of linking science with practice. Many scientific workers have gone deep into reality to investigate situations and strive to connect scientific research work with practice. For example, scientific workers from the Mechanical Engineering Society conducted a survey of workplaces with dust throughout the city and proposed to advance in this area in order to solve the problem of dust harming the health of workers.

    唐山市各学会
    积极开展学术活动
    本报讯　河北省唐山市科联于去年10月份成立以来，唐山市学术活动逐渐活跃。到12月底，该市已有土木工程学会、机械工程学会、电机工程学会、采煤工程学会、化学学会、金属学会、医学会、物理学会、数学学会、纺织学会（现在还是一个小组）等十个学会，已登记的会员达六百多名，分布在全市各大厂矿和医院、学校等单位。
    各专门学会成立后，科学工作者们便向专门的科学方面开始了进军。到目前为止，活动较多的是医学会。这个学会已经组织过五次学术性的报告会。报告内容有：“脊椎结核病灶清除术”、“青光眼”、“骨髓输血”、“急动脉损伤”等。其他学会也都在积极活动。电机工程学会和机械工程学会都举行过一至二次学术性的报告会；采煤工程学会也举行了报告会，报告内容有：
  “林西煤矿水文地质及冲积层构造”、“冲积层下面留煤柱问题”、“唐家庄煤矿水文地质情况”。
    全市的科学工作者在向科学进军中，特别注意科学联系实际的问题。不少科学工作者都深入实际，调查情况，尽力把科学研究工作同实际联系起来。如机械工程学会的科学工作者们对全市有粉尘的工作场所进行了调查，提出要向这方面进军，以便解决粉尘侵害职工健康的问题。　（王　靖）
