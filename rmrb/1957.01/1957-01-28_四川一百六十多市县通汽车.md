Xinhua News Agency: By the end of 1956, Sichuan Province had overfulfilled its highway construction task for the First Five-Year Plan by more than ninety kilometers. Now, over 160 cities and counties throughout the province are accessible by automobile. In 1949, however, 104 out of Sichuan Province’s 195 county towns had no roads.

This year, highway construction throughout the province will be further developed. The routes to be built include the Dong'e Luo-Batang highway and the Daxian-Bazhong highway. The surveying of these soon-to-be-constructed highways has already been completed. It is estimated that by the end of this year, Sichuan Province will have a total of 13,600 kilometers of highways, approaching 150% of the total highway length in 1952.

    四川一百六十多市县通汽车
    据新华社讯　到1956年底，四川省超额九十多公里完成了第一个五年计划期间的公路修筑任务。现在全省已经有一百六十多个市、县通行汽车。而在1949年，四川省的一百九十五个县城中却有一百零四个不通公路。
    今年，全省公路建设将有进一步发展。修筑的路线有东（俄洛）巴（塘）公路和达（县）巴（中）公路等。这些即将新建的公路目前已经测量完毕。预计到今年年底，四川省将有总长度为一万三千六百公里的公路线，接近于1952年公路总长的150％。
