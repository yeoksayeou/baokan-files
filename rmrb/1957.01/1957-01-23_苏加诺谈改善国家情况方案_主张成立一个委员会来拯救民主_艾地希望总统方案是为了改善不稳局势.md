Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, Electric Dispatch: Indonesian President Sukarno, in a written statement on the 17th responding to questions from Western journalists, explained his concept of the recently rumored plan for the President to propose the establishment of a "Revolutionary Committee" to improve the Indonesian national situation.

President Sukarno first stated in his written statement that since this new proposal had not yet been explained to the government or the press, he could not provide detailed explanations of the idea. However, he affirmed that the name he intended to give the committee was definitely not "Revolutionary Committee."

Prior to this, according to a January 16th report by "Dongxing Bao," the President's plan would include establishing a supreme organization to determine the basic direction of national leadership – a Leadership (Defense) Committee, or a Revolutionary Committee. This committee would have approximately fourteen members, including the chiefs of staff of the three armed forces and revolutionary leaders from various parties, groups, and youth circles. The report stated that under this committee, a cabinet with administrative power would continue to exist as usual. The current cabinet would undergo extensive reorganization to achieve a balance of power and continue to be maintained. The parliament would remain a legislative body, but it would focus all its efforts on construction work and no longer emphasize the activities of political parties.

President Sukarno continued in his written statement released today, explaining his own "concept." He said that if Indonesia's democratic system is allowed to develop as it is currently, it will not achieve the results we hope for, either as a political system or in its development in our country's economy.

Sukarno stated that Indonesia is not yet equipped to implement Western parliamentary democracy. He said, we have indigenous democratic traditions with many centuries of history. To save democracy, we must find solutions based on our experiments in Indonesia for about eleven years. It will never be a dictatorship. The Indonesian people value individual freedom more than anyone else, but on the other hand, adopting unrestrained opposition in order to obtain a majority of more than half will only degenerate into fighting merely to eliminate political opponents.

In response to a reporter's question about why he did not want to lead a presidential cabinet, Sukarno said that under the current circumstances of political parties, a presidential cabinet can only temporarily solve some temporary problems and cannot pave the way for Indonesia's true democratic system.

Sukarno went on to explain his recent idea of burying Indonesia's political parties, saying, when I say bury political parties, I don't mean bury democracy. This is only to issue a serious warning to party leaders, admonishing them not to continue like this, ignoring the needs and desires, hopes and disappointments of millions of people, simply because party leaders have reached an agreement at headquarters. Democracy serves the interests of the general public first, not just the political freedom of party leaders.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 22nd, Electric Dispatch: According to a January 21st report by Antara News Agency, Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit, in response to reporters' questions about President Sukarno's plan, said that the Indonesian Communist Party does not yet know the contents of the President's plan. Therefore, the Indonesian Communist Party cannot yet decide on its attitude towards it.

Aidit said that if the content of the President's plan is to dissolve political parties and freeze parliament, the Indonesian Communist Party obviously cannot agree. However, if the President's plan is to change the current unstable situation, that is, to reduce the opposition (or contradictions) between parties and groups so that construction can proceed smoothly, the Indonesian Communist Party will seriously and earnestly discuss this issue.

Prior to this, Masjumi Party Chairman Mohammad Natsir had raised objections to President Sukarno's plan.

Natsir believes that there is no fundamental difference between Western democracy and Eastern democracy; there is only one kind of democracy. Further discussing this issue, he acknowledged that the unhealthy actions of the current political parties are hindering progress. However, he believes that the solution to this problem lies in uniting some political leaders. He used this to reiterate the Masjumi Party's proposal to restore cooperation between President Sukarno and retired Vice President Hatta.

### 苏加诺谈改善国家情况方案  主张成立一个委员会来拯救民主  艾地希望总统方案是为了改善不稳局势

    苏加诺谈改善国家情况方案
    主张成立一个委员会来拯救民主
    艾地希望总统方案是为了改善不稳局势
    据新华社雅加达电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺17日在答复西方记者所提问题的书面谈话中，说明了他对这里最近传闻的关于总统将提出建立“革命委员会”以改善印度尼西亚国家情况的方案的概念。
    苏加诺总统在书面谈话中首先说，由于这个新主张还没有向政府或报界解释，所以他不能就这个想法进行详细的解释。但是，他肯定了这样一点：他打算替委员会起的名称根本不是“革命委员会”。
    在此以前，据“东星报”16日报道，这项总统方案将包括设立一个决定有关国家领导基本路线的最高级组织——领导（国防）委员会，或者是革命委员会。这个委员会的成员约十四人，其中将包括三军参谋长以及各党派、各团体和青年界的革命领袖。消息说，在这个委员会之下，具有行政权力的内阁仍然照常存在，现内阁将经过广泛的改组，以便达成一种力量均衡而继续维待下去。国会则仍然是立法机构，但是，它将倾注全力于建设工作，而不再重视政党的活动。
    苏加诺总统在今天发表的书面谈话中接着说明他自己的“概念”，他说，印度尼西亚的民主制度，如果听任它像目前这样发展的话，不论作为政治制度来说或者在它在我国发展中的经济方面都不会得到我们所希望的结果。
    苏加诺表示印度尼西亚还不具备实行西方议会民主的条件。他说，我们具有许多世纪历史的本国民主传统。为了拯救民主，必须根据我们约十一年来在印度尼西亚进行的实验来找出解决办法。它决不会是独裁。印度尼西亚人民比其他任何人更珍视个人自由，但是另一方面，采取不受约束的反对以便取得半数多一票的多数，只会退化到仅仅为消除政治对手而斗争。
    在答复记者提出的关于他为什么不想领导总统内阁的问题时，苏加诺说，在目前的政党的情况下，总统内阁只能暂时解决一些临时性问题，不能为印度尼西亚的真正的民主制度铺平道路。
    苏加诺接着解释了他最近谈到的埋葬印度尼西亚各政党的想法，他说，我说埋葬政党，并不是说埋葬民主。这样讲仅仅是为了对政党领袖们提出严正警告，告诫他们不可以这样做下去，漠视千百万人的需要和愿望、希望和失望，仅仅是因为党的领袖们在总部达成了协议。民主首先是为一般人的利益服务，不是只表现政党领袖们的政治自由。
    据新华社雅加达22日电　据安塔拉通讯社21日报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在回答记者提出的有关苏加诺总统方案的问题时说，印度尼西亚共产党还不知道总统方案的内容，因此，印度尼西亚共产党现在还不能决定对它的态度。
    艾地说，如果总统方案的内容是要解散政党和冻结国会，印度尼西亚共产党显然不能同意。但是，如果总统方案是为了改变目前的不稳局势，也就是为了减少党派和集团之间的对立（或矛盾）而使建设得以顺利进行的话，印度尼西亚共产党就将认真而严肃地讨论这个问题。
    在这以前，马斯友美党主席穆罕默德·纳席尔曾经对苏加诺总统的方案提出了反对的意见。
    纳席尔认为，西方民主和东方民主根本没有区别；民主只有一种。在进一步谈到这个问题时，他承认目前各政党的不健康的行动阻碍了进步。但是，他认为，要解决这个问题还是在于使一些政治领袖联合起来。他借此重申了马斯友美党的关于恢复苏加诺总统和退休了的副总统哈达之间的合作的主张。
