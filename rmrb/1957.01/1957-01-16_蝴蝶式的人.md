    Butterfly-Style People
    Qin Mu
    In swimming pools, people swim in various styles. There's the breaststroke, the dolphin kick, the butterfly… The butterfly stroke, it is said, resembles a butterfly fluttering among flowers. Whether it actually looks like that is hard for me to say, but watching this style, I am reminded of a type of butterfly-style person in the world.
    Hans Christian Andersen has a fairy tale called "The Butterfly." Although the story is about a butterfly, I think it describes butterfly-style people perfectly. The fairy tale goes: A butterfly was determined to find a lovely little sweetheart among the flowers. So he flew among the flowers, scrutinizing each one. Crocuses and snowdrops were pretty, and the butterfly thought they were like cute little girls just awakening to love, but he also felt "they are too naive." What about the anemone? He felt "this girl's bitterness is a bit too strong." Other flowers, "violets are a bit too passionate; tulips are too gorgeous; daffodils are too common; linden flowers are too small, and she has too many relatives; apple blossoms look very much like roses, but they bloom today and wither tomorrow—they fall as soon as the wind blows, and he felt that a marriage with them wouldn't last long." The pea flower was originally graceful and lovely, and the butterfly was just about to propose to her when he saw a pea pod nearby, with a withered flower hanging at the tip. When he learned that this was the pea flower's sister, and thought that this pea flower would also look like her in the future, he was startled and flew away. After that, the butterfly never found a partner. In late autumn, he crashed into someone's house, was pinned to a needle, and stored in a small antique box. This unfortunate butterfly, flying east and west and accomplishing nothing, still comforted himself with this thought: "Now I am perched on a stem like a flower, which is not very pleasant. It's almost like being married, because I am now firmly pinned down."
    Reading such a fairy tale, and recalling the phenomena we see in life, I think many people will smile knowingly.
    In life, there are indeed people like these butterflies flitting among flowers. You can see them everywhere in lively situations. Their demeanor, their background, their ambitions, all seem quite grand. But watching them bustle about, what they actually accomplish in the end remains a mystery, but in the end, they can always use some words of half-resentment and half-consolation to dismiss themselves, just like that butterfly.
    In the realm of love, there are such people. They pick and choose, like the most fastidious customers who scour the whole city but still may not find a pair of socks to their liking. This one is not good, that one is not wonderful, this one is too fat, that one is too thin, so-and-so's eyes are not pretty, so-and-so's figure is not graceful. They examine the tiniest flaws in people like radar or tracer atoms. Every member of the opposite sex who approaches them is criticized behind their backs as worthless. Such people, of course, cannot find a suitable partner, and in their old age, they either become monsters who despise all love in the world, or they act in desperation, lower their standards, and casually marry someone just to get it over with. Such people can be seen in many places.
    In learning, there are also such butterfly-like people flitting among flowers. The learning plans they make are simply astonishingly grand. They have no foundation in foreign languages, but they want to learn several foreign languages in a short period of time. They want to read all the books of Marxism-Leninism. They want to read the complete works of all the great writers. They fly around in bookstores like a butterfly flitting among flowers, buying back piles and piles of books, filling their bedside tables and bookshelves. But it is rare to see them seriously read a thicker book from beginning to end. Year after year passes, and while many people painstakingly but steadily climb to the peaks of science or art, such people are still circling around at the foot of the peak, complaining about this and that, complaining that no one helps, complaining about the lack of time, complaining about the lack of energy. Even in old age, they still cannot acquire relatively systematic and precise knowledge of that subject.
    In the work field, there are also such people who are in a bad mood all day long, always thinking that "the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence," feeling all day long that they have "no place to use their talents," and living with a face that says "I'm talented but unappreciated." They always deal with work lazily. They have a great time during the New Year and other holidays, and their speeches during reviews are also passionate, but they just can't change this lazy attitude toward work. It is said that they want to work in industry, but as soon as they are transferred to the industrial sector, they think that engaging in cultural and educational work is where there is "development potential." Once they are engaged in cultural and educational work, they find that there is a surprisingly large amount of administrative work. They feel that a person should go around everywhere to "get in touch with life," but when they actually start running around, they complain that life is too hard and unstable, and that there is "no way to study." In short, believe it or not, there are such people who are in a bad mood year after year. They are transferred here and there, always complaining about whatever they do. They spend their days in this kind of self-pity and lamenting their lack of opportunity. While many people are working hard, these people are actually enjoying the fruits of other people's labor—because no matter how bad their mood is, they still have to eat, receive a salary, live in a house, and stroll in the park… they always enjoy the labor products provided by others. And they, on the other hand, are the most likely to cut corners when it comes to their own labor! In this relationship, the collective suffers a great loss, and they, on the other hand, still feel that the collective has treated them unfairly.
    Yes, there are such people in our lives. They live like butterflies flitting among flowers, seeming to have great aspirations, seeming to be very busy, but in reality, they never accomplish anything. I think this type of person should occupy a seat in modern comedy.
    It's not that love can be casual, and it's not that learning can be without lofty ambitions. This is not some kind of tragic flaw in character; it is actually a problem of ideological awareness.
    When a person is not clear about himself and the objective world, he can only see others and himself in a distorted mirror, becoming either fatter or thinner, either magnified or reduced.
    When a person lacks a genuine spirit of collectivism, he cannot truly respect others and seriously treat himself. He cannot recognize the infinitely sublime, glorious, and beautiful nature of the word "labor."
    The existence of butterfly-style people reflects the complex and intricate influences of the old world.
    We cannot simply paint people with only two colors, black and white. People like these butterflies flitting among flowers cannot be considered bad people. We cannot paint them with black. However, such people do form problems in various corners, and the problems are not small. Revealing the hidden spiritual world of people in various forms between black and white, I think, would be of great benefit to the transformation of people.

    蝴蝶式的人
    秦牧
    在游泳池里，人们游泳有种种花样。有蛙式，海豚式，蝴蝶式……。蝴蝶式，据说那姿势就像一只在花丛间飞舞的蝶儿。究竟像不像我觉得很难说，但看了这种花式，我倒想到世间的确有一种蝴蝶式的人。
    安徒生有一个童话就叫做“蝴蝶”。故事里讲的虽然是一只蝴蝶，但我觉得它可真形容尽致地描述了那种蝴蝶式的人。这童话说：有一只蝴蝶立志要在群花中找一位可爱的小恋人。于是他在花丛间飞舞，端详着一朵朵的花。番红花和雪形花是好看的，蝴蝶也认为她们像情窦初开的可爱的小姑娘，但是又觉得“她们太不懂世故了。”秋牡丹呢？他觉得“这姑娘苦味未免太浓了一点”。其他的花，“紫罗兰有点太热情；郁金香太华丽；黄水仙太平民化；菩提树花太小，而且她的亲戚也太多，苹果树花看起来倒很像玫瑰，但是她们今天开了，明天就谢——只要风一吹就落下来了，他觉得跟她们结婚是不会长久的。”豌豆花本来是娴雅可爱的，蝴蝶正打算向她求婚的时候，却看到了她近旁有一个豆荚，豆荚的尖端上挂着一朵枯萎了的花。当他知道这就是豌豆花的姊姊的时候，想到这豌豆花将来也会和她一个模样儿，不禁大吃一惊地飞走了。以后这蝴蝶一直都没有找到对象，晚秋的时候他撞进了人家的房子里，被人别在一根针上，藏在一个小古董匣子里了。这只不幸的东飞西撞、一事无成的蝴蝶，却还用这样一种思想来安慰自己：“现在我像花儿一样，栖在一根梗子上了，这的确不太愉快。这几乎跟结了婚没有两样，因为我现在给牢牢地钉住了。”
    看了这样的童话，想起我们在生活里见到的事象，我想很多人都会发出会心的微笑的。
    在生活里，的确有这种穿花蝴蝶似的人，热闹的场合里你到处可以看到他。他的气派，他的来头，他的抱负，似乎都很不小。但是看他忙忙碌碌，到头来做了些什么事情，却只落得个“天晓得”，不过到了最后，他总是能用些半怨艾半慰解的话来排遣他自己就像那蝴蝶一样。
    在情场中有这样的人，他东拣西挑，像最苛刻的跑遍全城却未必能买到一对合意的袜子那样的顾客似的挑选对象。这个不好，那个不妙，这个太肥，那个太瘦，某甲眼睛不好看，某乙身段不窈窕。他像雷达或者示踪原子似的检查人们身上最细微的缺点，每一个接近他的异性在背后都给批评得不值一文钱。这样子的人当然找不到适当的对象，到垂老的时候，或者就变成了一个鄙夷人间一切爱情的怪物，或者就事急马行田，只好降格以求，随便找个人结婚了事。这样的人，在不少地方都是可以见到的。
    在学习上也有这种穿花蝴蝶似的人，他订的学习计划简直大到惊人。他外国文字毫无基础，却要在短短期间内学几种外国文，他要读完马克思列宁主义的一切书籍，他要读所有大作家的全集。他像一只穿花蝴蝶似的在书店里飞来飞去，买回来一大叠一大叠的书籍，床头书架都放得满满的。但你却很难见到他认认真真的读完一本较厚的书。一年一年地过去了，当许多人一步步吃力但却着实地攀登上科学或者艺术的高峰时，这样的人却依然在高峰下团团转，怨东怨西，怨没人帮助，怨时间少，怨精力不足。一直到老依然没法获得关于那一门学问的比较系统和精确的知识。
    在工作领域里也有这样的人，一天到晚闹情绪，一山望见一山高，终日里觉得“英雄无用武之地”，拉着怀才不遇的面孔过日子。他总是懒洋洋地应付着工作，过年过节他也玩得挺欢，检讨时他的发言也热烈，但就是这种对待工作懒洋洋的劲儿没法子改。据说他是希望去搞工业，但一调到工业部门他又想到了搞文教才“有发展前途”。一到搞文教时又觉得这里竟有意外多的事务工作。觉得一个人应该到处去跑跑，才能够“接触生活”，到真的跑起来了又嫌生活太艰苦和不安定，“没有法子学习”。总之，信不信由你，有这样一种人，长年累月都在闹情绪。调来调去总是干一行，怨一行。就在这种自怨自艾和怀才不遇的嗟叹中，度过了岁月。当许多人辛勤劳动的时候，这种人实际享受了别人的劳动成果——因为无论他闹情绪，他总要吃饭，领薪水，住房子，逛公园……，总要享受人们提供的劳动产品。而他，却偏偏最偷工减料地付出自己的劳动！在这一关系中，集体很吃亏，而他，却还觉得集体薄待了自己。
    是的，在我们生活中有这样一些人。他们像是穿花蝴蝶似的过日子，很有怀抱似的，很忙碌似的，实际上却总是干不出什么事情来。我想，这一类型的人，在现代喜剧中应该占有一席位。
    并不是说恋爱可以随便，学习可以没有远大的志向，这并不是什么性格的悲剧，实际上是思想意识的问题。
    当一个人对自己和对客观世界认识不清楚的时候，他就只能够在凹凸镜里看别人和看自己，不是变肥了就是变瘦，不是放大了就是缩小。
    当一个人缺乏真正的集体主义精神的时候，他不可能认真尊重别人和严肃对待自己。不可能认识“劳动”这个词的无限崇高、光荣、美丽的性质。
    蝴蝶式的人的存在，反映了旧世界的复杂错综的影响。
    我们不能单纯用黑白两种颜色去画人，像这种穿花蝴蝶似的人决不能算做坏人。我们不能用黑颜色去画他。然而这种人又的确在各个角落里形成了问题，而且问题不小。揭露黑白两种颜色之间的各种形态的人隐蔽的精神世界，我想对于人的改造会有很大的好处。
