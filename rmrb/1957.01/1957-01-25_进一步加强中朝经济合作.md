To further strengthen Sino-Korean economic cooperation
    Gao Jingsheng
    China and North Korea are close neighbors, and the people of the two countries have a long tradition of friendship and close economic ties. Since the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, the friendly relations between China and North Korea have entered a new era, and the economic relations between the two countries have also developed more rapidly and extensively.
    On August 18, 1950, the governments of China and North Korea signed a barter agreement based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation. On November 23, 1953, the government delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held friendly talks and issued a joint communique. The communique stipulated that in order to help the Korean government heal the wounds of war and restore the national economy, the Chinese government decided to provide economic assistance to the Korean government. At the same time, the two governments also signed the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the Agreement on the Conditions for Korean Technicians to Intern in China and Chinese Technicians to Work in Korea. The signing of these important documents, which legally fixed the friendly and cooperative relations between China and North Korea, is of great significance for the development of the two countries' economic undertakings and the strengthening of the socialist camp.
    In the past few years, our two governments and peoples have unswervingly followed the principles of friendly unity between socialist countries, carried out close cooperation in economic, technical and other aspects, and made many contributions to the economic construction of the two countries through the joint efforts of both sides. From 1954 to 1956, China dispatched batches of technicians in shipbuilding, welding, cement manufacturing, enamel, glass, ceramics, daily necessities, silk weaving, etc. to North Korea to provide technical assistance. These technicians imparted their technology and experience to Korean comrades without reservation, and also learned a lot of production experience and useful knowledge from the Korean people. In addition, a large number of Korean comrades came to China to study professional knowledge in steelmaking, casting, shipbuilding, construction, railway construction, fertilizer manufacturing, textile, printing and dyeing, silk reeling, printing, leather making, wood processing, canning, and cigarette making. Many of these interns have completed their studies and returned to their socialist construction posts in their motherland.
    The trade volume between China and North Korea has been increasing year by year. With the economic recovery and development of the two countries, the variety and quantity of goods supplied to each other are also increasing and expanding. In recent years, China has imported various mineral products, chemical raw materials, ginseng, seafood, fruits, medicinal materials, etc. from North Korea. Some of these materials are raw materials needed for China's industrial development, and some are daily necessities loved by the Chinese people. China supplies North Korea with coal, coke, grain, cotton, cotton cloth, salt, cement, wood, steel, tires, vehicles, ships, machinery and equipment, and railway construction materials. The mutual supply of the above-mentioned materials has played a positive role in the economic recovery, socialist construction and improvement of people's lives in both countries.
    The trade and assistance negotiations between China and North Korea for 1957 have been successfully concluded. Government representatives of both sides signed the 1957 Goods Exchange Protocol and the China Aid to Korea Protocol in Pyongyang on January 24. According to the provisions of the Goods Exchange Protocol, the trade volume between the two countries in 1957 will be greater than last year. From the variety of goods mutually supplied as stipulated in the two protocols on goods exchange and assistance, it can be seen that in addition to the main materials that have been supplied in previous years, North Korea will also export many new important materials to China, such as iron sand, non-ferrous metals, tool steel, shaped steel, cement, etc. The supply of these materials is a strong support for China's socialist construction.
    1957 is the year when China completes its first five-year plan and prepares to start its second five-year plan, and it is also the first year of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's implementation of its first five-year plan. The Chinese and Korean people, united by common ideals and goals, will work more closely together in economic and technical aspects in the future in order to successfully complete the glorious and arduous socialist construction tasks facing each other. We firmly believe that with the increasing economic development of the two countries, the fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese and Korean people will become more consolidated and closer, and will make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the two countries.

    进一步加强中朝经济合作
    高竞生
    中朝两国是亲近的邻邦，两国人民有着悠久的传统友谊和密切的经济联系。自从朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国成立以后，中朝两国的友谊关系进入了一个新的时期，两国的经济关系也随着获得了更迅速更广泛的发展。
    1950年8月18日，中朝两国政府基于平等互利和友好合作的原则，签订了两国的易货协定。1953年11月23日，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团进行了友好的会谈并发表了谈判公报。公报中规定，为了帮助朝鲜政府医治战争创伤和恢复国民经济，中国政府决定给予朝鲜政府经济援助。与此同时，双方政府还签订了中朝经济及文化合作协定和朝鲜技术人员在中国实习及中国技术人员在朝鲜工作条件的协定。这些用法律形式把中朝两国友好合作关系固定下来的重要文件的签订，对于发展两国的经济事业以及壮大社会主义阵营力量，具有重要的意义。
    在过去几年中，我们两国政府和人民坚持不渝地遵循着社会主义国家间友好团结的原则，进行经济、技术各方面的密切合作，并在双方的共同努力下，为两国的经济建设事业作出了不少的贡献。从1954年到1956年，我国曾分批派遣了造船、焊接、制造水泥、珐琅、玻璃、陶瓷以及日用品、织绸等技术人员，前往朝鲜进行技术援助。这些技术人员把自己的技术和经验毫无保留地传授给朝鲜同志，同时也向朝鲜人民学到了许多生产经验和有益的知识。另外，还有大批朝鲜同志到中国来，学习炼钢、铸造、造船、建筑、修筑铁路、制造肥料、纺织、印染、缫丝、印刷、制革、木材加工、制造罐头、制烟等专业知识，其中有许多实习生已经学成回国，走上了他们祖国的社会主义建设岗位。
    中朝两国的贸易额在逐年增长。随着两国经济的恢复和发展，互供货物的品种、数量也不断地增多和扩大。几年来，我国从朝鲜进口的物资有各种矿产品、化工原料、人参、海产品、水果、药材等。这些物资有的是我国工业发展所需要的原料，有的是我国人民所喜爱的生活日用品。我国供应朝鲜的物资有煤炭、焦炭、粮食、棉花、棉布、食盐、水泥、木材、钢材、轮胎、车辆、船只以及机器设备、铁路建设器材等。上述物资的相互供应，对于两国的经济恢复、社会主义建设和人民生活的改善，都起了积极的作用。
    中朝两国1957年的贸易和援助谈判现已顺利结束，双方政府代表并于1月24日在平壤签订了1957年货物交换议定书和中国援助朝鲜的议定书。根据货物交换议定书的规定，1957年两国的贸易额将比去年有更大的增长。从货物交换和援助这两个议定书所规定的相互供应货物的品种可以看到，双方除历年已供应的主要物资今年仍继续供应外，朝鲜方面还将向中国出口许多新的重要物资，如铁砂、有色金属、工具钢、型钢、水泥等，这些物资的供应，对我国的社会主义建设是一个有力的支援。
    1957年是我国完成第一个五年计划和准备开始第二个五年计划的一年，也是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国执行第一个五年计划的头一年。由共同的理想和目标团结起来的中朝两国人民，为了胜利完成彼此所面临的光荣而艰巨的社会主义建设任务，今后在经济技术各方面将会更加亲密地携手并进。我们深信，随着两国经济的日益发展，中朝两国人民兄弟般的互助合作关系将愈加巩固和密切，并将对两国的社会主义建设事业作出更大的贡献。
