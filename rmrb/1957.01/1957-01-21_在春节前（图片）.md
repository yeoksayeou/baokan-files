	From last Spring Festival to now, China has made tremendous achievements in socialist construction and has basically completed the great socialist transformation. Therefore, this year people will celebrate the Spring Festival with even more excitement.
	To help people have a good Spring Festival, the commercial departments are actively preparing a large amount of materials, and the transportation departments are also working hard to allocate transportation tools to solve the passenger transport difficulties during the Spring Festival.
	This year's Spring Festival should be lively, and at the same time, we should promote the spirit of hard work and plain living, and pay attention to thrift.

The blackboard newspaper in the office building of the Ministry of Communications calls on everyone to celebrate the Spring Festival in a spirit of thrift.
	Many workers and staff members, displaying the spirit of hard work and plain living, have taken out a portion of their pocket money during the Spring Festival and deposited it in the bank to support national construction.
