    Beijing Philosophy Circle Discusses Issues in the History of Chinese Philosophy

    (Our Dispatch) A symposium on the history of Chinese philosophy, convened by the Department of Philosophy of Peking University, held a preparatory meeting from the 22nd to the 26th of this month. In addition to the teaching staff of the Department of Philosophy of Peking University, more than one hundred philosophy workers from the Department of Philosophy of Renmin University of China, the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences, the Central High-Level Party School of the Chinese Communist Party, and other units participated. The symposium revolved around some problems encountered in the teaching and research of the history of Chinese philosophy in recent years and unfolded into a heated debate.

    In the past few years, the Teaching and Research Office of the History of Chinese Philosophy of the Department of Philosophy of Peking University has achieved some success in teaching and research, but it has also encountered many difficulties. At the same time, due to the tendency of dogmatism in teaching and research and the failure to conduct specific analysis of specific issues in the history of philosophy based on Marxist principles, the development of Chinese philosophy has been simplified and formalized, and the content of "History of Philosophy" has become dry and impoverished. In order to overcome these shortcomings, improve the level of research in the history of philosophy, and enrich the content of "History of Philosophy," the comrades of the Teaching and Research Office put forward some specific opinions based on the problems existing in past teaching and research. Some of the issues have been written into articles, and some of the articles have been published in the "People's Daily" and the "Guangming Daily." In order to gather opinions and clarify these issues, the Department of Philosophy of Peking University convened this symposium.

    At the symposium, many issues related to the history of philosophy were discussed, such as the object and scope of the history of Chinese philosophy, the evaluation of historical idealist philosophy, whether there are materialist factors in historical views and ethics before Marxism, and the characteristics of Chinese philosophy and the inheritance of Chinese philosophical heritage. Moreover, due to the discussion of these specific issues, fundamental philosophical issues were involved, such as the relationship between materialism and idealism.

    He Lin, in his paper "Opinions on Two Controversial Issues in the Study of the History of Philosophy" (see today's edition), put forward his views on the struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of philosophy. His opinion aroused heated discussion at the meeting. The speakers unanimously believed that in the past, in our teaching, we lacked specific analysis and research on the rich content of the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism. As a result, the development process of the history of philosophy has become very impoverished. This tendency of simplification should be corrected. Materialism and idealism not only exclude each other but also influence each other in the history of philosophical development. It is also a one-sided view to only recognize struggle and not recognize the aspects of unity. However, many speakers pointed out that in He Lin's article, due to his efforts to emphasize that "idealism and materialism are not two fixed camps," and that the struggle in the history of philosophy is "not a parallel struggle between two camps, one side being materialism and the other being idealism," and that historical materialists and idealists are often in a teacher-student-friend relationship, etc., it will actually reach the conclusion of denying the fundamental and principled difference between materialism and idealism. Many speakers believe that in the process of philosophical development, the struggle between materialism and idealism is absolute, while the aspect of unity is only relative and temporary. Overemphasizing the aspect of unity while ignoring the absoluteness of the struggle can easily deviate from the Party's principles of Marxism. Guan Feng and Sun Dingguo both pointed out that idealism and materialism are two opposing systems. Although some materialists and idealists in history have mutually influenced each other on individual viewpoints, they cannot blur the boundaries between the two major camps. The mutual influence between the two only means "the Tao is one foot high, the devil is ten feet high," and does not mean that they can compromise with each other. The struggle between materialism and idealism in history is sharp. Although some materialists and idealists have teacher-student-friend relationships, their worldviews are hostile, and the partisanship of philosophy cannot be concealed.

    He Lin also said in his speech that Marxist philosophy is dialectical materialism and historical materialism, with the focus on "dialectical" and "historical," and not on materialism. Many comrades disagreed with this opinion. Some comrades pointed out that dialectics is very important and is a component of Marxist philosophy, but it is incorrect to think that materialism is secondary. Raising the importance of dialectics above materialism can easily blur the line between materialism and idealism.

    The meeting also discussed the issue of evaluating historical idealist philosophy. Many speakers pointed out that in the past, our treatment of idealist philosophy in teaching was too simplistic, sometimes adopting a sweeping approach without deeply analyzing the epistemological roots of idealist philosophy, as Lenin said. However, different opinions emerged in the meeting on how to correct this bias. Some individuals emphasized the contribution of idealist philosophy, believing that it not only has a "rational kernel" but also that certain idealist viewpoints themselves are valuable, and that it cannot be said that idealism is absolutely wrong and materialism is absolutely correct. Huang Zitong, Tang Yue, Wang Fangming, Guan Feng, Zhang Shiying, and others spoke, disagreeing with the above opinions. They all believed that the "rational kernel" in idealist philosophy should be distinguished from the idealist system, and that idealist philosophical viewpoints should be distinguished from idealists and idealist works. It cannot be said in general terms that idealist philosophy is beneficial. Idealists and their works may have made contributions on individual issues, but idealist viewpoints themselves are wrong because they are inconsistent with the facts. Zhang Shiying analyzed the contribution of idealist philosophy in his speech. He pointed out that historical idealists' solutions to certain philosophical problems were wrong, but the questions they raised inspired later materialists, enabling materialists to avoid mistakes in solving these problems. The "rational kernel" in idealist philosophy is materialist because it is consistent with the facts, but it contradicts the idealist system. Before Marxism, idealists sometimes saw certain aspects of truth more than materialists, but these aspects were distortedly reflected. Only by stripping away the distorted parts can these aspects of truth be valuable. As for certain idealist viewpoints in history, although they played a certain progressive role under the historical conditions at the time, they were still wrong in themselves. We cannot equate correctness and error with progressive and reactionary roles. In short, most comrades believed that although certain idealists made some contributions on individual issues, it cannot be concluded that idealist viewpoints themselves are correct and valuable.

    The symposium also discussed the issue of inheriting Chinese philosophical heritage. Some comrades believed that we had negated too much of the philosophical heritage in the past, and the scope of inheritance was too narrow. They demanded that more heritage be inherited to enrich the content of the history of philosophy. Therefore, Feng Youlan put forward the issue of the possibility of inheriting heritage and the criteria for inheritance in his speech. He believes that since philosophy has class character, but we are now inheriting it, then what we inherit can only be the non-class elements in it. He believes that a philosophical proposition can have two parts of meaning: one part is the abstract or general meaning, and the other part is the concrete or specific meaning. The specific meaning has class character, and the general meaning does not have class character, so it can be inherited. For example, when we inherit Hegel's philosophy, we abandon the special significance of the development of the absolute concept and only take its general meaning of "development." When we inherit ancient moral norms, we also abandon the part of its special significance and take its general meaning. Some comrades basically agreed with Feng Youlan's opinion, believing that although the general and the special cannot be separated, the distinction between the two cannot be erased. If the general is not recognized, it is difficult to talk about inheritance. The question is that the general things we inherit are beneficial to the people.

    In response to these opinions, debates also unfolded. Most comrades disagreed with Feng Youlan's opinion. Hong Qian, Yang Zhengdian, Wang Zisong, Hu Sheng, and Ai Siqi pointed out in their speeches that distinguishing between the general and the special cannot be used as the criterion for inheriting heritage. Wang Zisong and Yang Zhengdian pointed out that separating the general from the special is tantamount to admitting that there are things that exist independently from the special. This is a metaphysical way of thinking, and this kind of inheritance only means the retention of old things, not critical transformation. Hu Sheng believes that judging whether a thing has class character should start from the substantive content of the thing itself. If there is actually no supra-class moral concept, but only a supra-class abstract moral concept is imagined in the mind, and it is then determined that there is a supra-class morality in fact, that is only unscientific abstraction, which is precisely the manifestation of idealistic views. Ai Siqi believes that if we inherit according to the criteria proposed by Mr. Feng Youlan, then everything abstract can be inherited, and the general propositions of idealist philosophy can also be inherited. In this way, the difference between the two traditions of materialism and idealism is erased in the issue of inheritance. He pointed out that what we want to inherit in philosophy is the materialist and dialectical things. The so-called inheritance is to critically transform and absorb the past philosophical heritage according to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism.

    In addition, around this issue, the purpose of studying the history of Chinese philosophy was also discussed. Some comrades believe that the purpose of studying the history of Chinese philosophy is to inherit the good things in the philosophical heritage and use them to serve modern life. Hu Sheng pointed out that the fundamental purpose of studying the history of philosophy is to specifically understand the laws of the struggle of philosophical thought, summarize the experience and lessons of the struggle in the history of philosophy, guide the struggle on the current philosophical front, and help us establish a scientific materialist world view, rather than simply inheriting the good things in the heritage.

    The above are the main controversial issues in this symposium. Clarifying these issues is helpful for overcoming the tendency of dogmatism and for correctly unfolding the research on the history of Chinese philosophy. Of course, this does not mean that dogmatism has been overcome. Through this symposium, many comrades realized that in the teaching and research of the history of philosophy, on the one hand, it is necessary to overcome the tendency of dogmatism, but on the other hand, in the struggle to overcome dogmatism, it is also necessary to prevent deviations from the basic principles of Marxist philosophy. Many comrades believe that in order to truly overcome dogmatism, we should further study and better grasp the theory of Marxism, master rich historical materials, and use the viewpoints and methods of Marxism to analyze specific materials. We must work hard and put in a lot of labor to continuously improve the level of research on the history of Chinese philosophy. Some specific issues related to the study of the history of Chinese philosophy have not been fully discussed at this meeting. The meeting organizers requested everyone to continue research and put forward research results so that another meeting can be held when conditions permit. (Zhu Bokun)

    北京哲学界讨论中国哲学史问题
    本报讯　由北京大学哲学系召开的中国哲学史座谈会于本月22日到26日举行了预备会议。参加的除北京大学哲学系教学人员外，还有中国人民大学哲学系、科学院哲学研究所、中共中央高级党校等单位的哲学工作者一百多人。座谈会围绕着近年来中国哲学史教学和研究工作中所遇到的一些问题，展开了热烈的辩论。
    北京大学哲学系中国哲学史教研室几年来在教学研究中，取得了一些成绩，但也碰到了许多困难，同时由于教学研究中存在着教条主义的倾向，不善于依据马克思主义原理对哲学史上的具体问题进行具体分析，结果把中国哲学的发展弄得简单化和公式化，把“哲学史”的讲授内容，弄得枯燥、贫乏。为了克服这些缺点，提高哲学史的研究水平，丰富“哲学史”的讲授内容，教研室的同志们根据过去教学、研究中存在的问题，提出了若干具体意见。有些问题已经写成了文章，部分文章已在“人民日报”和“光明日报”上发表。为了集思广益，澄清这些问题，北京大学哲学系召开了这个座谈会。
    座谈会上，讨论了许多有关哲学史的问题，如中国哲学史的对象和范围问题，对历史上唯心主义哲学的估价问题，马克思主义以前的历史观和伦理学说中有无唯物主义因素的问题，关于中国哲学的特点和中国哲学遗产的继承问题等，并且由于讨论这些具体问题，而涉及了哲学上的带有根本性质的问题，唯物主义和唯心主义的关系问题。
    贺麟在他的论文“对于哲学史研究中两个争论问题的意见”（见今日本版）中，对哲学史上唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争，提出了自己的看法。他的意见在会议上引起了热烈的讨论。发言的人一致认为：过去我们在教学中，对唯物主义和唯心主义斗争史中的丰富内容，缺乏具体的分析研究，结果，把哲学史的发展过程，弄得很贫乏。这种简单化的偏向是应当纠正的。唯物主义和唯心主义，在哲学发展史中，不仅相互排斥，也相互影响，只承认斗争，而不承认有统一的方面，也是片面的看法。但是许多发言的人指出，在贺麟的文章中由于竭力强调“唯心主义和唯物主义并不是两个固定的阵营”，哲学史上的斗争，并“不是一面是唯物主义一面是唯心主义的那样平行的两个阵营斗争”，历史上的唯物主义者和唯心主义者时常是师生朋友的关系等等，实际上会达到否认唯物主义和唯心主义之间的根本的、原则性的区别的结论。许多发言的人认为，在哲学发展的过程中，唯物主义和唯心主义之间的斗争是绝对的，而统一的方面，只是相对的、暂时的。过分强调统一的方面，而忽略了斗争的绝对性，就很容易脱离马克思主义的党性原则。关锋和孙定国都指出，唯心主义和唯物主义是两个对立的体系，尽管历史上某些唯物主义者和唯心主义者，在个别观点上互相影响，但不能因此就混淆了两大阵营的界线。二者的相互影响，只意味着“道高一尺，魔高一丈，魔高一丈，道高十丈”，并非表示可以互相妥协。历史上唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争是尖锐的，尽管某些唯物主义和唯心主义者有着师生朋友的关系，但他们的世界观是敌对的，不能因此掩盖了哲学的党派性。
    贺麟在发言中还说：马克思主义哲学是辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的，重点在于“辩证的”和“历史的”，而不在于唯物主义。许多同志不同意这一意见。有的同志指出，辩证法是十分重要的，是马克思主义哲学的组成部分，但因此认为唯物主义是次要的，这种看法是不正确的。把辩证法的重要性提到唯物主义之上，就容易模糊了唯物主义和唯心主义的界线。
    会议上也讨论了对历史上唯心主义哲学的估价问题。许多发言的人指出，过去我们在教学中，对唯心主义哲学的处理过于简单化，有时采取了一笔抹煞的态度，而没有像列宁所说的那样，深入地分析唯心主义哲学的认识论根源。但是对于如何纠正这种偏向，会议中出现了不同的意见。个别的人强调唯心主义哲学的贡献，认为其中不仅有“合理的内核”，而且某些唯心主义观点本身也是有价值的，并且认为，不能说唯心主义是绝对错误的，唯物主义是绝对正确的。黄子通、唐钺、王方明、关锋、张世英等人发言，不同意以上的意见。他们都认为应该把唯心主义哲学中的“合理内核”和唯心主义体系区分开来，把唯心主义哲学观点跟唯心主义者和唯心主义著作区别开来，不能笼统地说，唯心主义哲学有好处。唯心主义者和他的著作中，在个别问题上，可能有贡献，但唯心主义观点本身却是错误的。因为这种观点本身是和事实不符合的。张世英在发言中对唯心主义哲学的贡献，进行了分析。他指出，历史上的唯心主义者对某些哲学问题的解决是错误的，但他们所提出的问题，却启发了后来的唯物主义者，使唯物主义者在解决这些问题上可以避免错误。唯心主义哲学中的“合理内核”，是唯物主义的，因为是和事实相符合的，但却和唯心主义的体系相矛盾。在马克思主义以前，唯心主义者有时比唯物主义者多看到了真理的某些片面，但这些片面是被歪曲地反映出来的，只有剥掉其中歪曲的部分，这种真理的片面才是有价值的。至于历史上某些唯心主义观点，在当时历史条件下，虽然起过一定的进步作用，但它本身还是错误的，我们不能把正确、错误跟进步、反动的作用等同起来。总之，大多数同志都认为，尽管某些唯心主义者在个别问题上有一些贡献，但不能因此得出结论说，唯心主义观点本身是正确的，有价值的。
    座谈会上也讨论了关于中国哲学遗产的继承问题。有些同志认为我们过去对哲学遗产否定的太多了，而且继承的范围也太狭隘了，要求继承更多的遗产，充实哲学史的讲授内容。因此，冯友兰在发言中，提出了关于继承遗产的可能性和继承的标准问题。他认为哲学既然是有阶级性的，但我们现在又要继承，那末，我们所继承的，只能是其中非阶级性的东西。他认为一个哲学命题可以有两部分意义。一部分是抽象的或一般的意义，一部分是具体的或特殊的意义。特殊的意义是有阶级性的，一般的意义是没有阶级性的，因而可以继承下来。例如，我们继承黑格尔的哲学时，抛弃绝对观念发展的特殊意义，只取其关于“发展”的一般的意义。我们继承古代的道德规范时，也是抛弃它的特殊意义的部分，取其一般的意义。有些同志，基本上同意冯友兰的意见，认为一般和特殊虽然不能分割，但也不能因此抹煞二者的区别，如果不承认一般，就很难有继承可言。问题在于我们所继承的一般的东西，是对人民有益的东西。
    针对这些意见，也展开了争辩。多数同志不同意冯友兰的意见。洪谦、杨正典、汪子嵩、胡绳、艾思奇在发言中都指出，区分一般和特殊，不能作为继承遗产的标准。汪子嵩和杨正典指出，把一般和特殊加以割裂，等于承认有脱离特殊而独立存在的东西，这是一种形而上学的思想方法，而这种继承，只意味着对旧东西的保留，而不是批判地改造。胡绳认为，判断一个事物有无阶级性，要从事物本身实质内容出发，如果事实上并没有超阶级的道德观念，而只是在头脑里想出一个超阶级的抽象的道德观念，并从而断定事实上有超阶级的道德，那只是非科学的抽象，这正是唯心主义观点的表现。艾思奇认为，如果按着冯友兰先生所提出的标准去继承，那末，一切抽象的东西都可继承下来，唯心主义哲学的一般的命题，也都可以继承下来，这样，在继承问题上，便抹煞了唯物主义和唯心主义两种传统的差别。他指出，在哲学上我们所要继承的，就是唯物主义的和辩证法的东西。所谓继承就是按着辩证唯物主义的观点，对过去的哲学遗产，加以批判地改造和吸收。
    此外，围绕这个问题，也讨论到研究中国哲学史的目的性的问题。有些同志认为，研究中国哲学史的目的，在于继承哲学遗产中的好东西，拿来为现代生活服务。胡绳指出，研究哲学史的根本目的，在于具体地了解哲学思想斗争的规律，总结哲学史上斗争的经验和教训，指导当前哲学战线上的斗争，帮助我们建立科学的唯物主义世界观，而不是单纯地为了继承遗产中的好东西。
    以上是这次座谈会中主要的争论问题。澄清这些问题对于克服教条主义倾向，对于正确地展开中国哲学史的研究是有帮助的。当然不能因此就克服了教条主义。通过这次座谈会，许多同志都认识到，在哲学史的教学研究中，一方面要克服教条主义的倾向，但另一方面，在克服教条主义的斗争中，也要防止脱离马克思主义哲学史的基本原则。许多同志都认为，要真正克服教条主义，还应该进一步学习和更好地掌握马克思主义的理论，掌握丰富的史料，运用马克思主义的观点和方法，对具体材料进行分析；必须要刻苦钻研，付出大量的劳动，才能不断提高中国哲学史的研究水平。还有一些有关中国哲学史研究的具体问题，在这次会议上尚未得到充分的讨论，会议主持人要求大家继续进行研究，提出研究成果，以便在有条件时举行另一次的会议。　（朱伯昆）
