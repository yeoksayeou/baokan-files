    In the "Coal Sea" - Pingdingshan
    By our reporter Zhang Jianhong
    Pingdingshan, a place people call the "Coal Sea," although today's map does not yet have its name, it already possesses a tremendous appeal to the developers of underground treasures and those who care about the construction of the motherland!
    Not long ago, one morning, we took a long-distance bus from Xuchang City, Henan Province, and embarked on a journey to Pingdingshan. After driving more than sixty kilometers and then making a small turn, Pingdingshan, which we longed to admire, stood tall in the distance. It was not as majestic and precipitous as people imagined. The mountain was low and short, like an upside-down washbasin stably placed on the horizon. It and the Luohe Mountain, the Leigutai, the Mapeng Mountain, and the Shou Mountain in the east form an undulating ring of mountains. From a distance, it reminded me of the earthen dike I had seen on the banks of the Yangtze River that blocked the peak of the flood. However, in the eyes of geological workers, it is not an ordinary mountain range, but a precious belt containing abundant coal. These mountains are covered with grayish-white rocks that sparkle in the sun. Since 1953, geologists have studied these beautiful rocks and determined that there is a large amount of coal underneath them. Thus, along the "strike" of the coal, a vast coalfield has been formed between Xiangcheng, Yexian, Linru, and Baofeng. The coal reserves are more than hundreds of billions of tons. If calculated according to the current annual output of Fushun Coal, China's coal capital, it can be mined for at least eight hundred years. But even more exciting than Fushun is that there are many types of coal here, including prime coking coal, fat coal, lean coal... available for industrial production and civilian use, truly everything! The geological structure of the coal is simple, the coal seams are stable, close to the surface, and easy to mine. Experienced geologists have long determined that this is China's future Donbass!
    In recent years, the 401 Geological Exploration Team has conducted general surveys and detailed investigations in the vast area of ​​this "Coal Sea," and proposed geological data for some designed mine shafts. The state has initially determined to build ten pairs of mine shafts here. The small wells have an annual output of 300,000 tons, and the large wells have an annual output of 1.2 million tons. The No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 mines started construction one after another in 1955, and the No. 5 mine shaft also broke ground at the end of last year. This year, the No. 2 mine, which was the first to be built, can be put into production. According to the original plan, these ten pairs of mine shafts will all start construction in 1959, and all will be put into production in 1962. At that time, according to the design, the annual output can reach 9.6 million tons, exceeding the production level of Kailuan Coal Mine, China's second largest mine. In the future, enterprises near the Longhai and Beijing-Hankou lines can obtain a large amount of industrial "grain" from here; Wuhan Iron and Steel Company can also obtain inexpensive coking coal from this closest location.
    Adjacent to the foot of Pingdingshan is a wide plain. Around the Zhugeliang Temple Village, where Zhuge Liang is said to have lived, a new workers' city is taking shape. On several new highways, vehicles transporting building materials are running in an endless stream; the Meng (Miao) Ping (Ding) branch line taken over from the Beijing-Hankou Railway can be officially opened to traffic soon. Nearly 100,000 square meters of houses form a lively market. There are vegetable markets, kiosks, department stores, theaters, and a club that is about to be completed. A modern flour mill is under construction. The coal mine technical school, which has a considerable scale, has already started. The temporary power plant that supplies production power and urban lighting is slowly emitting light smoke from its chimneys. At night, the lights on the drilling rigs and vertical shafts are like stars in the night sky. Soon, a washing plant that can wash several million tons of coal a year, a large-scale mine machinery repair and manufacturing plant, and a power plant that can generate tens of thousands of kilowatts of electricity will be established here...
    The beautiful prospects of Pingdingshan inspire people; thousands of builders have devoted their hard work to it. In the autumn of 1953, the geological exploration team entered the mountainous area. At that time, there were only a few villages here. It was not only difficult to get vegetables, but also difficult to drink water. When the first batch of boreholes were drilled, it was often necessary to carry water from a long distance to mix the mud. Heavy snow covered the narrow mountain paths, and people needed to take a wooden stick, explore the road, and crawl to the drilling rig; in the summer, the scorching sun baked the bare mountains without grass or trees, and people could only take advantage of the shadow of the drilling rig to cool off. When the drilling rig lacked parts, they often found ways to manufacture them themselves. Last year alone, they collected 7,000 yuan worth of scrap metal and used it to modify drill bits and other parts. In 1955, the construction team of the mine came. In this place without any industrial foundation, without old mines and urban support, they overcame numerous difficulties and worked hard to complete their tasks. When the first batch of shafts started construction, there were not enough construction materials, so they had to use rails instead of anvils and wooden frogs instead of iron frogs; in the absence of power supply, they had to use storage battery lights to illuminate the excavation...
    In the face of difficulties, the broad masses of workers not only worked hard with great enthusiasm to overcome difficulties, but also rapidly improved their skills and working abilities. Wang Xuefen, a 19-year-old female technician from the 401 Geological Exploration Team, once proposed to drill two fewer boreholes and achieved the same geological effect, saving the country more than 30,000 yuan. She came to the geological exploration team three years ago and served as a recorder on the drilling rig, relying solely on the classroom knowledge she learned in half a year at the Southwest Geological School. At first, she knew almost nothing. After bringing back rock cores and coal cores from the field, she needed to consult other comrades before making a judgment. Later, she was transferred to the office to do the work of calculating reserves and drawing maps. At first, she either drew uneven lines or missed boreholes. However, after years of hard work and studying with an open mind, she is now familiar with these tasks and has become a capable assistant to the responsible engineer.
    Since Engineer Han Yingshan from this team left, Shi Qiguang, a first-level technician, has taken on the responsibility of technical guidance for the entire team. On the first night we arrived at the team headquarters, he spread out geological maps under the lamp as if enumerating his family's treasures. In just two hours, he gave us a concise and vivid introduction to the burial conditions of Pingdingshan coal, making us feel like we had encountered a geological expert. However, when he first came to this team, he was a new student who had just graduated from the Beijing Geological Institute. Over the years, Engineer Han Yingshan guided him, and Soviet expert Comrade Blomeni and others taught him, enabling him to basically master the complete set of geological exploration technology and complete geological reports of good quality.
    The short experiences of these young people tell us that the construction achievements of Pingdingshan are connected to the growth of the people here like flesh and blood. They built the motherland, and the ever-changing development of the motherland has also improved them and nurtured them!
    In 1957, new tasks were put forward to the builders of Pingdingshan. The state requires that a large amount of high-quality coal be mined from here as soon as possible. After the 401 Geological Exploration Team overfulfilled the storage task of the first five-year plan one year and nine months ahead of schedule, it launched an increase production and practice economy campaign. They will complete another geological report in the near future, and then drill boreholes to the periphery of the originally planned drilling area. Four pairs of mine shafts are under construction. The No. 2 mine shaft, which was the first to start construction and stands at the foot of Pingdingshan, has made great progress in underground engineering and ground-level coal conveying belt corridor projects; the workers are full of confidence and are preparing to ensure quality while striving to get the mine out of coal as soon as possible.

    在“煤海”——平顶山
    本报记者　张健虹
    平顶山，这个被人们称为“煤海”的地方，尽管今天的地图上还没有它的名字，然而它对于地下宝藏的开发者和关心祖国建设的人们，却早已具有了一种巨大的魅力！
    不久以前的一个早晨，我们在河南省许昌市搭长途汽车踏上了到平顶山去的旅途。行车六十多公里，然后拐了一个小弯，我们渴望瞻仰一番的平顶山，便耸然在望了。它不如人们设想的那样巍峨峭拔，山身低矮，仿佛是一个倒过来的脸盆稳稳地扣在地平线上。它和西边的落?山、擂鼓台，东面的马棚山、首山等组成一个起伏不平的山的环带。远远看去，使我想起了在长江边上见过的那条挡住大水洪峰的土堤。但是，在地质工作人员眼睛里，它却不是一个平凡的山群，而是一根蕴藏着丰富煤炭的宝带。这些山上，到处是灰白色的岩石，在太阳下面亮光闪闪。从1953年起，地质工作者就研究过这些美丽的岩石，并且判定在它们下面有大量煤炭。由此沿着煤的“走向”，构成了襄城、叶县、临汝、宝丰之间的一个广阔的煤田。煤的储量在百数十亿吨以上，如果按现在我国煤都——抚顺煤的年产量计算，至少可以开采八百年。但是比抚顺更加振奋人心的是：这里的煤种特多，有主焦煤、肥煤、瘦煤……可供工业生产，可以民用，真是应有尽有！煤的地质构造简单，煤层平稳，距地表近，容易开采。有经验的地质工作者早就断定这儿是中国未来的顿巴斯！
    几年来，四○一地质勘探队在这个“煤海”的广大地区进行了普查、精查，提出了一部分设计矿井的地质资料。国家已经初步确定在这里建设十对矿井。小井年产量为三十万吨，大井年产量为一百二十万吨。二、三、四矿三对井，在1955年先后开始施工，五矿井筒也在去年年底破土兴建。今年，最先建设的二矿就可以投入生产。按照原来的规划，这十对矿井在1959年都要开工，1962年全部投入生产。那时候，按照设计，年产量可达九百六十万吨，超过我国第二大矿——开滦煤矿的生产水平。将来，陇海、京汉线附近的企业可以从这里源源获得大量工业“粮食”；武汉钢铁公司也可以从这个距离最近的地点，取得价钱便宜的炼焦用煤。
    紧靠平顶山脚下，是一带开阔的平原。在据说诸葛亮居住过的诸葛庙村周围，一座新的工人城正在形成。几条新公路上，川流不息地奔驰着运送建筑材料的车辆；从京汉铁路接过来的孟（庙）平（顶）支线，不久可以正式通车。将近十万平方公尺的房舍，组成了热闹的街市。有蔬菜市场，售货亭，百货公司，剧院，还有即将完工的俱乐部。一座现代化的面粉厂正在建筑中。具有相当规模的煤矿技术学校已经开学。供应生产动力和城市照明的临时电厂，烟囱里悠悠地吐着轻烟。晚上，钻机上、竖井上的灯光，有如夜空的明星。不久，这里还要建立年洗几百万吨煤的洗选厂，大型的矿山机械修制厂，以及能够发出数万瓩电力的电厂……。
    平顶山美好的远景，鼓舞着人们；成千上万的建设者为它付出了辛勤的劳动。1953年秋天地质勘探队进入山区，那时候，这里只有寥寥的几处村落。不仅吃菜困难，喝水也困难。第一批钻孔打钻的时候，常常需要到老远的地方担水来搅拌泥浆。大雪掩住了羊肠小道，人们需要带着一根木棍，一边探路，一边爬行着走上钻机；夏天烈日烘烤着不长草木的、光秃秃的山野，人们只能借着钻机的影子乘凉。钻机上缺乏机件的时候，他们常常自己想办法修造。去年一年，他们一共收集了价值七千元的废金属，用来改制钻头等机件。1955年矿井的施工队伍来了。他们在这个没有些微工业基础，没有老矿和城市依托的地方，克服重重困难，努力完成任务。第一批井筒开工的时候，施工器材不足，他们只好用铁轨代替砧子，用木道叉代替铁道叉；在没有电源的情况下，他们只好用蓄电池灯来照明掘进……。
    广大职工在困难面前，不但以高度的热情努力工作，克服困难，而且迅速地提高了自己的技术和工作能力。四○一地质勘探队十九岁的女技术员王学芬，曾经提出少打两个钻孔，取得了同样的地质效果，为国家节省了三万多元的费用。她是三年以前到地质勘探队来的，仅仅凭她在西南地质学校半年中学习的课堂知识，担任了钻机上采记员的职务。开始，她简直什么也不懂，从野外带回岩芯、煤芯以后，需要请教其他同志才能作出判断。后来，她被调到室内做计算储量、制图的工作。起先，她不是把线条画的粗细不匀，就是漏掉了钻孔。但是，经过几年来的艰苦努力，虚心学习，现在，她已经熟悉了这些工作，而且成了负责工程师的得力的助手。
    一级技术员石其光，自从这个队上的韩影山工程师调走以后，全队的技术指导责任就由他担当起来。我们到队部的第一天晚上，他在灯下如数家珍地摊开了一张张地质图，在短短的两小时内，把平顶山煤的埋藏状况向我们作了简明而生动的介绍，使我们感到像是碰到了一个地质专家。可是，他刚到这个队上来的时候，是个新由北京地质学院毕业的学生。几年之中，韩影山工程师指导了他，苏联专家布洛梅尼同志等教导了他，使他基本掌握了全套的地质勘探技术，完成了质量很好的地质报告。
    这些年轻人的短短经历，告诉我们：平顶山的建设成就，同这儿人们的成长有着血肉一般的联系。他们建设了祖国，祖国日新月异发展着的事业也提高了他们，滋养了他们！
    1957年向平顶山的建设者们提出了新的课题。国家要求尽快地从这里开采出大量品质优良的煤炭。四○一地质勘探队在提前一年零九个月超额完成了第一个五年计划的储量任务之后，又掀起了增产节约运动。他们要在最近再完成一个地质报告，然后把钻孔打到原来计划打钻区域的外围去。四对矿井正在紧张施工。最先开工的矗立在平顶山脚下的二矿矿井，井下工程和地面的送返煤皮带走廊等工程都已经有很大的进展；职工们正满怀信心地准备在保证质量的条件下，争取使矿井早日出煤。
