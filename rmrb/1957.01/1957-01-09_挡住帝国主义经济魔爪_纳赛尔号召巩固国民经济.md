Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 8th -- Egyptian President Nasser recently said in a conversation with the governors of the Egyptian Liberation Province that while Egypt is engaged in political struggle, it will use its main strength to consolidate its national economy. This economy will be built on a purely national basis, so that imperialism cannot harm it.

Nasser said that this is necessary to make up for the losses of the past few hundred years. In the past, imperialism caused our backwardness.

He said that a free national economy means the destruction of imperialism. Therefore, imperialism has used all means within its power to oppose it in the past, and will continue to oppose it.

Nasser called on the Egyptian people to strive to achieve this goal. He said: "The wheels of history will not turn backwards. All the conspiracies and attempts of imperialism will eventually be shattered in the face of our solid unity, in the face of our confidence in the cause of justice and strength."

Nasser's remarks were published in the latest issue of "Awakening" magazine.

    挡住帝国主义经济魔爪
    纳赛尔号召巩固国民经济
    新华社开罗8日电　埃及总统纳赛尔最近在同埃及解放省省长谈话时说，埃及在进行政治斗争的同时，将以主要的力量来巩固它的国民经济，这种经济将建立在纯民族的基础上，使帝国主义损害不了它。
    纳赛尔说，为了补救过去几百年来的损耗，这是必要的。过去帝国主义造成了我们的落后。
    他说，自由的国民经济意味着帝国主义的毁灭。因此帝国主义过去用了力所能及的一切办法来反对它，而且将会继续进行反对。
    纳赛尔号召埃及人民为达到这个目标而努力。他说：“历史的车轮不会向后转。帝国主义的一切阴谋和企图终于会在我们坚固的团结面前，在我们对正义事业和力量的信心面前碰得粉碎。”
    纳赛尔的谈话刊登在最近一期“觉醒”杂志上。
