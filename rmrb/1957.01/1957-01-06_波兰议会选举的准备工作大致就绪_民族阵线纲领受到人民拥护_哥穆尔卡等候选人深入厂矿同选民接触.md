Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 5th. Preparations for the election of members of the Polish Parliament, which will be held in half a month, are nearly complete. Currently, the nomination of candidates and voter registration have been completed, and meetings between candidates and voters continue to be held in various locations.

　　In the list of 720 National Unity Front candidates proposed by the consultation committee of various political parties and social organizations in Poland, Polish United Workers' Party members account for 53%, the United Peasants' Party accounts for 25%, the Democratic Party accounts for 8%, and the remaining 14% are non-party members and representatives of progressive Catholic organizations.

　　These candidates include prominent Polish political leaders, experts from various sectors of the national economy, representatives from the scientific and cultural fields, as well as workers and farmers.

　　Many socio-political leaders who were previously unable to actively participate in political life have been nominated as candidates.

　　In the upcoming parliamentary elections, 459 members of parliament will be elected from these 720 candidates. Poland currently has a population of 27.5 million, with each member of parliament representing 60,000 people.

　　Currently, the Polish election campaign is in the stage of direct contact between candidates and voters. Gomulka, Cyrankiewicz, Ochab and other leaders of the United Workers' Party and the government, who have been nominated as candidates, have visited enterprises in places such as Tczew, Nowa Huta, Krakow, and Katowice to meet with workers. They gave detailed explanations on the National Unity Front's election program, the country's political and economic issues, the international situation, the tasks of the future society, and many other issues of concern to workers.

　　The National Unity Front's election program has been endorsed by the people nationwide. Various cooperative organizations across the country recently issued a joint declaration expressing their support and willingness to make every effort to implement this program. The declaration called on more than seven million cooperative members in urban and rural areas to vote for the candidates of the National Unity Front.

　　The broad masses of voters have shown great concern for the election campaign. They actively participate in meetings with candidates and express their support for the National Unity Front's election program. A voter in Warsaw said during a meeting with candidates: This program represents the will of the entire Polish people. Those with ulterior motives who slander socialism can only engage in some shameful and dirty tricks, and cannot offer any different opinions on this program. Another worker said: Our past construction achievements are right here, visible to anyone with eyes. Our party has made mistakes, but the party is determined and is correcting those mistakes. We workers trust our party and are willing to give the party time to overcome temporary difficulties.

    波兰议会选举的准备工作大致就绪
    民族阵线纲领受到人民拥护
    哥穆尔卡等候选人深入厂矿同选民接触
    新华社华沙5日电　波兰议会议员的选举将在半月以后举行。目前候选人提名和选民登记工作都已经完成，候选人同选民的会见正在各地继续举行。
    在波兰各政党和社会团体协商委员会所提出的七百二十名民族统一阵线候选人名单里，波兰统一工人党党员占53％，统一农民党占25％，民主党占8％，其余14％是无党派人士和进步天主教团体的代表。
    这些候选人包括了波兰著名的政治领袖、国民经济各部门的专家、科学文化界的代表人物和工人、农民。
    有许多过去没有可能积极参加政治生活的社会政治领袖被提名为候选人。
    在即将到来的议会选举中，将要从这七百二十名候选人里面选出议员四百五十九名。波兰目前人口为二千七百五十万，每一名议员代表六万人。
    目前，波兰的选举运动正处在候选人同选民直接接触的阶段。被提名为候选人的统一工人党和政府领导人哥穆尔卡、西伦凯维兹、奥哈布等分别到彻索夫、诺瓦胡塔、克拉科夫、卡托维兹等地的企业去同工人会了面。他们就民族统一阵线的选举纲领、国家的政治和经济问题、国际局势、未来社会的任务以及工人所关心的其他许多问题作了详细说明。
    民族统一阵线的选举纲领受到了全国人民的拥护。全国各种合作社组织最近发表了联合宣言，表示拥护并且愿尽一切努力来实现这一纲领，宣言号召城乡七百多万合作社员投票选举民族统一阵线的候选人。
    广大选民对选举运动表现了巨大的关心，他们积极参加同候选人的会见会，并且表示拥护民族统一阵线的选举纲领。华沙的一位选民在同候选人会见的时候说：这个纲领代表着全波人民的意志。那些诽谤社会主义的别有用心的人除了作一些见不得人的龌龊勾当以外，对这个纲领提不出任何不同的意见来。另一位工人说：我们过去的建设成果就摆在这儿，有眼睛的人都看得见。我们的党有过错误，但是党已经决心并且正在纠正那些错误。我们工人相信自己的党，愿意给党以时间来克服暂时的困难。
