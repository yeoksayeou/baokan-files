Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 22nd: Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo delivered a government statement on the situation in Sumatra at the plenary session of the parliament on the evening of the 21st.

He said that people outside of parliament who did not agree with the government's political program and its methods of implementation collected all the shortcomings of the government, used these shortcomings to attack the government, and adopted other courses of action outside of parliament. He said, "Any government that has sworn allegiance to the constitution is not allowed to adopt a course of action that violates our constitution in pursuit of achieving a certain goal; not to mention resorting to force."

The Prime Minister said that in resolving the Sumatra incident, in military terms, President Sukarno's orders issued on December 25th and 28th, 1956, in his capacity as Supreme Commander, would serve as the basis, to avoid and prevent the spread and outbreak of defection and opposition sentiments, and to avoid bloodshed and sacrifice. That is to say, the problem should be resolved in a tactful but clear and correct manner. At the same time, the government is making various efforts to meet the wishes of the people in various regions, including the enactment of a five-year development plan bill, and including some measures to achieve regional autonomy and development.

Sastroamidjojo emphasized that the government's policy to resolve the Sumatra incident is based on the belief that the government program must continue to be implemented in order to improve the country's current situation and improve the people's living standards.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 22nd: Many Indonesian newspapers today commented on the government statement made by Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo in parliament on the evening of the 21st.

The "People's Daily" believes that the government's attitude of resolutely stopping attempts to violate the constitution and continuing to implement its program is logical. However, the "People's Daily" regrets that the government's attitude towards the "Wild Bull Division Committee" in Central Sumatra is not clear enough. The newspaper said that efforts should be made to eliminate this regime that has betrayed the central government.

    印度尼西亚总理在国会
    宣布解决苏门答腊事件的政策
    据新华社雅加达22日电　21日晚上，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在国会全体会议上发表了政府关于苏门答腊局势的声明。
    他说，那些不赞成政府的政治纲领和它的执行方法的国会以外人士搜集了政府的一切缺点，用这些缺点来攻击政府，采取了国会以外的其他行动方针。他说，“已经宣誓忠于宪法的任何政府不允许在追求达到某种目的的时候，采取违背我们的宪法的方针；如果依靠武力就更用不着说了。”
    总理说，在解决苏门答腊事件时，在军事方面，苏加诺总统以最高统帅的身份在1956年12月25日和28日发布的命令将做为基础，避免并防范叛离和反对情绪的蔓延和爆发，避免流血和牺牲，那就是说要用圆通的但是清楚而正确的方式来解决问题。同时，政府正在进行各种努力来满足各地人民的愿望，其中包括制定五年发展计划法案，并且包括一些实现区域自治和发展的措施。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约强调说，政府解决苏门答腊事件的政策是以下面这种信念为基础的：必须继续执行政府纲领，以改善国家的现状和提高人民的生活水平。
    据新华社雅加达22日电　今天许多印度尼西亚报纸评论了沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理21日晚在国会所作的政府声明。
    “人民日报”认为，政府表示要坚决阻止违反宪法的企图和继续执行它的政纲，这种态度是合乎逻辑的。但是，政府对中苏门答腊“雄牛师委员会”的态度不够明确，“人民日报”对这一点感到遗憾。这家报纸说，应当设法使这个背叛中央政府的政权不再存在下去。
