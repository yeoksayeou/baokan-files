Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 19th: Syrian President Kuwatly and Indian Prime Minister Nehru ridiculed the so-called "power vacuum" in the Middle East on the evening of the 18th.

Kuwatly said that some people say there is a vacuum in West Asia. He said, "This vacuum statement itself is based on a vacuum."

Nehru said that several major powers are trying to intimidate smaller countries by saying that if smaller countries do not enter the scope of the major powers' military protection, international communism will swallow them up; this statement is "strange."

They made these remarks at a reception for the President of Syria by the citizens of Delhi.

In his speech, Kuwatly strongly condemned military alliances, especially the Baghdad Pact. He said that the Baghdad Pact is manipulated by imperialism and is detrimental to peace.

Kuwatly reiterated that his country will pursue an independent policy. He said that Syria will continue to live according to its own civilization and traditions, and is unwilling to obey the "needs" of any "aggressor or warmonger." He added: But imperialism will not let us be quiet, so we must put great strength in self-defense.

Kuwatly said that some Western countries insist that Syria has joined the Soviet camp because it has acquired Soviet weapons. He said these accusations are slander. Syria buys weapons from the Soviet Union for Syria's own self-defense, freedom and autonomy; "Syria will neither join the American bloc nor the Soviet bloc," but will continue to pursue its own independent policy.

In a brief speech, Nehru said that some major powers have failed to understand and appreciate the strong nationalist feelings of the Asian people to maintain their freedom and strive for economic progress.

He said that now some people are boasting of a theory that there is a power vacuum in West Asia. If this theory is accepted, it means that a foreign country wants to gain a dominant position in that region and interfere in the internal affairs and diplomacy of the countries in that region. This is the only way to explain this theory of power vacuum. On this basis, some people are now advocating that another foreign country should come in to take the place of the major powers that have been driven out of that region.

Nehru added that I can understand one country giving economic assistance to another country. But the difficulty now is that various aids are often linked to a militarized mentality, which wants to solve all problems in a military way. But the history of recent years has shown that this approach cannot solve any problems.

    叙利亚总统和印度总理嘲笑“中东真空”谬论
    据新华社新德里19日电　叙利亚总统库阿特利和印度总理尼赫鲁18日晚嘲笑了所谓中东“力量真空”的论调。
    库阿特利说，有人说，西亚出现了真空。他说：“这种真空的说法本身就立足于真空之中。”
    尼赫鲁说，若干大国正在企图恐吓小的国家说，如果较小国家不进入大国军事保护的范围以内，国际共产主义就会把他们吞并掉；这种说法是“奇怪的”。
    他们是在欢迎叙利亚总统的德里市民招待会上说这些话的。
    库阿特利在讲话时强烈地谴责了军事联盟，尤其是巴格达条约。他说，巴格达条约是帝国主义操纵的，是不利于和平的。
    库阿特利重申，他的国家将奉行独立的政策。他说，叙利亚将继续按照自己的文明和传统来生活，不愿意顺从任何“侵略者或者战争贩子”的“需要”。他又说：但是帝国主义是不会让我们安静的，因此，我们必须把极大的力量放在自卫方面。
    库阿特利说，某些西方国家硬说叙利亚由于获得了苏联的武器而参加了苏联阵营。他说，这些指责是中伤。叙利亚之所以从苏联购买武器，是为了叙利亚本国的自卫、自由和自主；“叙利亚将既不参加美国集团，也不参加苏联集团，”而是继续奉行自己独立政策。
    尼赫鲁在发表简短的讲话时说，某些大国未能了解和体会亚洲各国人民要维护自己的自由、争取经济进展的强烈民族主义感情。
    他说，现在有人在夸耀一种理论，说是西亚存在着力量真空。如果这一理论被接受的话，那就是说，有一个外来的国家要在那个区域里取得支配地位并且要干涉那个地区的各国的内政和外交。只有这样才能解释这种力量真空的理论。在这一基础上，现在有人主张，另外的某一个外国应当进来取得已经被逐出那个地区的大国的地位。
    尼赫鲁又说，我是能理解一个国家给予另一国家的经济援助的。但是现在的困难是，各种援助常常同军事化的心理有着联系，这种军事心理要以军事方式来解决一切问题。但是最近几年的历史已经表明，这种方式是不能解决任何问题的。
