African Folk Proverbs
　　If a crocodile leaves the river, it will even drink dew.
　　A gazelle's empty regret cannot stop the forest from burning.
　　Two goats cannot drink water from the same pot.
　　Don't forget that hot water is boiled from cold water.
　　Science is like a baobab tree, which cannot be embraced by one person. [Note] No matter how long the neck is, it is not taller than the head. Trees unite, and their strength surpasses that of an elephant. When traveling, never stay in the home of a rich man.
　　Translated by Zhao Zhiqiang and Wang Sengdao from "Spark" No. 33, 1956.
　　[Note] The baobab tree is a special plant in the tropical savanna of Africa, 18 to 25 meters high, with a very thick trunk, 8 to 9 meters in diameter, with white flowers and fruit that looks like long and large cucumbers, juicy and edible. This tree has a long life and can live for four to five thousand years. A family can live inside its tree hole.

    非洲民间谚语
    鳄鱼若是离开了河，连露水也喝。
    羚羊空惋惜也不能阻止烧尽森林。
    两只山羊不能在一个罐内喝水。
    别忘记热水是由冷水烧热的。
    科学就像波巴布树一样，是一个人搂抱不了的。〔注〕不论脖子多长也没脑袋高。树木结成一体，力量胜过大象。出门在外，千万别住在富翁家里。
      赵志强、王僧道译自“星火”1956年33期
    〔注〕波巴布树是非洲热带草原上的一种特殊植物，高十八到二十五公尺，干很粗，直径达八到九公尺，开白花，果实像又长又大的黄瓜，多汁可食。此树寿命很长，可活四千到五千年。它的树洞内可住一个家庭。
