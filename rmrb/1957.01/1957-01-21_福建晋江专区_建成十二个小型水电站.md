    Fujian Jinjiang Special District
    Builds Twelve Small Hydropower Stations
    (Our Dispatch) Last year, the Jinjiang Special District of Fujian Province built twelve rural small hydropower stations.
    These hydropower stations are distributed in Yongchun, Tong'an, Dehua, Anxi, Xianyou, Putian and other counties, with a total power generation of 367 kilowatts. After the Sanban Hydropower Station in Dehua County generated electricity, farmers calculated that using electric lights was cheaper than lighting candles, and they all liked using electric lights. After the Hongxing Hydropower Station in Tong'an County generated electricity, farmers installed rice milling machines here, so there was no need to carry grain to the county town more than ten miles away for processing. Anxi County installed a 70-horsepower water pump at the Beishi Hydropower Station, which can irrigate more than 1,000 mu of farmland.
    In addition to the active investment of farmers, the government also sent many technical cadres to provide in-depth guidance and invested more than 100,000 yuan in the construction of these hydropower stations.

    福建晋江专区
    建成十二个小型水电站
    本报讯　福建省晋江专区去年建成了十二个农村小型水力发电站。
    这些水力发电站分布在永春、同安、德化、安溪、仙游、莆田、等县，发电量一共是三百六十七瓩。德化县三班水电站发电后，农民算了一下，用电灯比点蜡烛还便宜，都欢喜用电灯。同安县洪星水电站发电后，农民在这里装上碾米机，谷子就不要挑到十多里远的县城去加工了。安溪县在北石水电站安了一部七十多匹马力的抽水机，可灌溉一千多亩农田。
    兴建这些水电站，除了农民积极投资外，政府还派了许多技术干部深入指导，并投资了十万多元。
