To Lay the Foundation for Increasing Agricultural Production
    Jilin and Anhui Vigorously Build Farmland Irrigation Projects
    Inner Mongolia's Irrigated Farmland Area Exceeds the First Five-Year Plan Target

    (Our report) According to the Jilin Daily: Since late August 1956, rural areas in Jilin Province have successively launched a high tide of farmland irrigation construction and have achieved great results.

    As of now, according to incomplete statistics from 30 counties, 443 reservoirs, ponds, dams, pumping stations, and expanded irrigation area projects have been completed, and 589 water wells have been dug. These can irrigate more than 19,000 hectares of paddy fields. More than 800 water conservancy projects and 343 water wells are under construction. The completed and under-construction water conservancy projects can irrigate more than 63,900 hectares of paddy fields, accounting for 42.5% of the 150,000 hectares planned for paddy field conversion this year. At the same time, 6 million cubic meters of flood control and drainage projects have been completed, and 497 kilometers of river and riverbank embankments have been restored, blocked, and reinforced, laying a solid foundation for protecting tens of thousands of hectares of fertile land along the rivers from flooding.

    Since last autumn, the progress of various farmland water conservancy projects in the province has been relatively fast. This is mainly because the leadership at all levels has strengthened leadership and made comprehensive arrangements for construction organization and various rural tasks. Eleven counties, including Jiutai, Shulan, Yitong, and Dongfeng, which have made faster progress, completed about 60% of this year's paddy field conversion plan before the end of last year. Although it is now deep winter, the farmland water conservancy construction work of many agricultural cooperatives is still actively underway.

    Judging from the overall progress of farmland water conservancy construction projects in the province, small-scale mass water conservancy projects have been completed well, while many mechanical water conservancy projects have not been completed well due to insufficient cement, steel bars, and power machinery equipment. This should be addressed.

    (Our Hefei dispatch) Millions of people in the Huaibei area of Anhui Province are building water conservancy projects. The Huaibei area is carrying out farmland water conservancy work with the focus on flood control and enclosure and converting to rice cultivation. Last year, more than one million mu in the Huaibei area were converted to rice cultivation, and the harvest was generally good. This fact has encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses in building water conservancy projects. At present, more than 1.4 million people in the Huaibei area have invested in farmland water conservancy work. More than 100,000 farmers in Su County completed 15% of the winter-spring water conservancy construction plan in just over ten days.

    The winter Huai River harnessing project has also started in full swing. 230,000 farmers from the three special districts of Bengbu, Fuyang, and Liu'an have arrived at various Huai River harnessing construction sites in the middle reaches of the Huai River.

    (Our report) According to the Inner Mongolia Daily: The irrigated farmland area in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region expanded by 3.06 million mu in 1956. Including the existing water conservancy projects, the irrigated area has reached more than 12 million mu, more than doubled compared with 1955, and exceeded the first Five-Year Plan target by 23%. Now, the irrigated land area in the region accounts for 15% of the total sown area.

    In terms of water conservancy construction, the region focused on small-scale farmland water conservancy projects that require less investment, yield greater benefits, and are popular among the masses. The region organized millions of laborers to carry out well-digging and various water conservancy projects in vast mountainous and plain areas. Within the planned year of 1956, the region dug 48,529 new wells, accounting for 138.9% of the plan, excavated 10,152 large and small drainage and flood diversion canals, renovated more than 5,900 old canals, and completed 108 annual maintenance projects in irrigated areas.

    In terms of soil and water conservation, due to the clear understanding that soil and water conservation is the basic way to build mountainous areas and develop diversified economies, the masses were organized to carry out various soil and water conservation works. In 1956, the planned area for controlling soil erosion was 1,000 square kilometers, and 1,267 square kilometers had been completed in the first half of last year. All of these played a great role in overcoming drought and ensuring increased agricultural production.

    The Water Conservancy Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made comprehensive arrangements for this year's farmland water conservancy construction work. The preliminary plan is to increase the irrigated area in the region by 3 million mu, of which the mass small-scale water conservancy increase is 2.6 million mu. In order to achieve this plan, the Water Conservancy Department has required water conservancy departments at all levels to first help the masses vigorously carry out winter farmland water conservancy work.

    为增产更多的农产品打基础
    吉林安徽大力兴修农田水利
    内蒙古农田灌溉面积突破第一个五年计划指标
    本报讯　据吉林日报报道：1956年8月下旬以来，吉林省各地农村先后掀起了兴修农田水利的热潮，并已取得很大的成绩。
    截至目前为止，据三十个县的不完全统计，已建成水库、塘坝、拦河坝、抽水机站、扩大灌区工程等四百四十三处，打成水井五百八十九眼，共可灌溉水田一万九千多公顷。正在施工的水利工程还有八百余处，水井三百四十三眼。已竣工和正在施工的水利工程，共可灌溉水田六万三千九百多公顷，占今年计划开改水田面积十五万公顷的42.5％。同时，还完成了防洪排涝工程六百万土方，复堤堵口和加固江、河堤防四百九十七公里，给沿江、沿河两岸成万公顷的良田免除水涝灾害打下了有力基础。
    去年秋季以来，这个省的各项农田水利工程的进展是比较快的，这主要是因为各级领导上加强了领导，对施工组织及农村各项工作都做了全面安排。进度较快的九台、舒兰、伊通、东丰等十一个县，在去年底以前即完成了今年开改水田计划的60％左右。目前虽然进入了严冬，但许多农业社的农田水利建设工作，仍在积极进行中。
    从这个省的农田水利建设工程总的进展情况来看，群众性的小型水利工程完成较好，而许多机械性水利工程因为水泥、钢筋、动力机械器材的不足，完成的很不好，这是应该注意解决的。
    本报合肥电　安徽省淮北地区有成百万人在兴修水利。淮北地区以治涝圈圩、改种水稻为中心，开展农田水利工作。去年淮北地区有一百多万亩改种水稻，一般收成较好。这个事实鼓舞了群众兴修水利的积极性。现在，淮北地区已有一百四十多万人投入农田水利工作。宿县十多万农民，十多天就完成去冬今春兴修水利计划的15％。
    冬季治淮工程也已全面开工。蚌埠、阜阳和六安三个专区的二十三万农民，已经到达淮河中游各治淮工地。
    本报讯　据内蒙古日报报道：内蒙古自治区的农田灌溉面积，在1956年扩大了三百零六万亩，加上原有的水利工程，已浇地一千二百多万亩，比1955年增加了两倍多，超过解放前灌溉面积一倍以上，超额23％突破第一个五年计划指标。现在，全区水地面积已占总播种面积的15％。
    在兴修水利方面，这个区把重点放在投资少、收益大、群众乐意经营的小型农田水利上。全区组织了数百万劳动大军，在广大山地和平原开展了打井及多种多样的水利工程。在1956年计划年度内，全区打成新井四万八千五百二十九眼，为计划的138.9％，开挖大小清、洪水渠一万零一百五十二道，整修旧渠五千九百多道，完成灌域岁修工程一百零八项。
    在水土保持方面，由于明确了水土保持是建设山区和发展多种经济的基本道路，组织群众进行了多种多样的水土保持工作。1956年计划控制水土流失面积一千平方公里，去年上半年就已完成一千二百六十七平方公里。所有这些，对战胜干旱，保证农业增产起了很大的作用。
    今年的农田水利建设工作，内蒙古自治区水利厅已作了全面安排，初步计划全区增灌面积为三百万亩，其中群众性小型水利增灌面积为二百六十万亩。为了实现这一计划，水利厅已要求各级水利部门，首先帮助群众大力开展冬季农田水利工作。
