Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 11th: The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today stating that the Korean people will never recognize the resolution on the Korean issue passed by the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee, manipulated by the United States without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which violates the will of the Korean people.

The commentary pointed out that the so-called holding of all-Korea general elections under the supervision of the United Nations to unify Korea, as stated in this resolution, is essentially an attempt by the United States to interfere in Korea under the guise of the United Nations, and to extend the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee to the whole of Korea. Its basic purpose is to prevent the Korean people from solving the Korean issue themselves. Therefore, this resolution is an unjust, unrealistic, and contains aggressive purposes, and the Korean people will never recognize it.

The commentary emphasized that to fairly resolve the Korean issue, it must be based on the principle that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. Based on this principle, the Republic side has repeatedly put forward reasonable and practical proposals. The most practical and feasible method at present is to hold talks and contacts between the North and South Korean authorities to eliminate the divisions between the North and South and to find ways to solve the Korean issue. The Republic government has repeatedly proposed consultations and contacts between North and South Korea, and will continue to work to promote its realization in the future. However, the Syngman Rhee government has consistently rejected the Republic's repeated proposals. The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea by various means, aggravating the tense situation in Korea, and they should bear full responsibility for the fact that Korea has not been unified to this day.

"Democratic Korea" also published a commentary today stating that the peaceful reunification of Korea requires first consolidating the Korean armistice, as well as establishing and developing ties between North and South Korea. All attempts to abolish and undermine the armistice agreement, and acts that foster distrust and antagonism between North and South Korea should be condemned.

    朝鲜报纸谴责联大政委会关于朝鲜问题的决议
    要求南北协商实现国家统一
    新华社平壤11日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，朝鲜人民决不承认违背朝鲜人民意志、在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加的情况下由美国操纵联合国大会政治委员会所通过的关于朝鲜问题的决议。
    评论指出，这个决议中所说的在联合国的监督下举行全朝鲜的普选以统一朝鲜，实质上就是美国企图在联合国的幌子下对朝鲜进行干涉，把李承晚的法西斯统治扩大到全朝鲜，它的基本目的是阻挠朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题。因此，这个决议是不公正、不现实、而且包含着侵略目的的决议，朝鲜人民决不承认它。
    评论强调指出，要公正地解决朝鲜问题，必须根据朝鲜问题由朝鲜人民自己解决这一原则。从这一原则出发，共和国方面曾经多次提出合理的实际的方案。目前最切实可行的办法是南北朝鲜当局之间进行会谈和接触，以消除南北之间的隔阂和寻找解决朝鲜问题的途径。共和国政府曾经一再提议南北朝鲜之间进行协商和接触，今后将继续努力促其实现。但是，李承晚政府一直拒绝共和国方面的多次建议。美国和李承晚集团以各种方法阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，加剧朝鲜的紧张局势，使朝鲜到今天还没有统一，对此他们要负全部的责任。
    “民主朝鲜报”今天也发表评论说，和平统一朝鲜首先要巩固朝鲜的停战，以及建立和发展南北朝鲜的联系。一切废除和破坏停战协定的企图、助长南北朝鲜间的不信任和对立的行为都应该受到谴责。
