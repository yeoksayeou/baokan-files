　　Vietnamese Table Tennis Team Plays First Match with Chinese Team

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing—On the eve of New Year's Day, the Vietnamese Table Tennis Delegation, invited to visit our country, played its first friendly match in China with the Chinese Table Tennis Team at the Beijing Gymnasium. In the five men's singles matches, one women's singles match, and one men's doubles match, the Chinese athletes won all.

    The Vietnamese team fielded Hoang Duc Quang, Trinh Thi Nhuan (female), Phan Huu Canh, Bui Duc Long, Duong Ky Hung, and Nguyen Khac Thinh. Hoang Duc Quang and Bui Duc Long participated in the doubles. The Chinese team fielded well-known table tennis players Wang Chuanyao, Sun Meiying (female), Fu Qifang, Zhuang Jiafu, Hu Bingquan, and Jiang Yongning. Wang Chuanyao and Fu Qifang participated in the doubles.

    In the first match, Hoang Duc Quang played against Wang Chuanyao, the 1956 national table tennis champion of our country. Wang Chuanyao scored continuously with his specialized forehand and backhand smashes and unexpected short drop shots, winning three to zero. Hoang Duc Quang's side-spin chop and counter-attacks also repeatedly won applause from the audience. In the second match, Trinh Thi Nhuan played against Sun Meiying, and in the third match, Phan Huu Canh played against Fu Qifang. Our athletes maintained the initiative with fierce smashes.

    When Bui Duc Long played against Zhuang Jiafu in the fourth match, the situation reversed from the previous three matches, where the Chinese team mainly attacked and the visiting team defended. As soon as Bui Duc Long took the court, he posed a great threat to Zhuang Jiafu with his drives to both corners and short drop shots. Zhuang Jiafu steadily saved many dangerous balls with his chop shots, and he often seized the opportunity to smash fiercely when the opponent dropped the ball, making it impossible for the opponent to rescue. Bui Duc Long led at the beginning of the second and third games, but lost due to more smash errors.

    The last match, Nguyen Khac Thinh against Jiang Yongning, closely attracted the entire audience. Jiang Yongning, who is good at chopping and saving dangerous balls, saved many dangerous balls in this match that the audience thought could not be saved. Nguyen Khac Thinh was able to attack and defend, and his draws and saves were swift and powerful. His all-around technique was also praised by the audience.

    The athletes of the Vietnamese Table Tennis Team, who came to visit our country, were recently selected through national competitions. Among them are cadres, workers, soldiers, teachers, students, photographers, and nurses. They are all outstanding table tennis players in Vietnam.

    The Vietnamese Table Tennis Team will also visit and compete in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanning, Zhuzhou, and other places.

    越南乒乓球队同我国队进行第一场比赛
    本报讯　元旦的前夕，应邀来我国访问的越南乒乓球代表队在北京体育馆同我国乒乓球队进行了来我国后的第一场友谊比赛。在五场男子单打、一场女子单打和一场男子双打的比赛中，中国队的运动员全部获胜。
    越南队上场的是黄德光、郑氏润（女）、潘友景、裴德龙、杨其兴和阮克盛，参加双打的是黄德光和裴德龙。中国队上场的是我国著名的乒乓球选手王传耀、孙梅英（女）、傅其芳、庄家富、胡炳权和姜永宁，参加双打的是王传耀和傅其芳。
    首场交锋，黄德光对我国1956年全国乒乓球比赛冠军王传耀。王传耀以专长的正反手猛烈扣杀和出其不意的短吊球连连得分，以三比○获胜。黄德光的横拍削球和伺隙反击也一再博得观众的掌声。第二场郑氏润对孙梅英，第三场潘友景对傅其芳，我国运动员也都以猛烈的扣杀，一直占主动地位。
    当第四场裴德龙对庄家富比赛时，一反前三场都是中国队以攻为主而客队防守的情况。裴德龙上场即以抽击对方两角和配合短吊球给了庄家富很大的威胁。庄家富以稳健的削球救起不少险球，他还往往趁对方吊球时赶上猛烈抽击，使对方无法抢救。裴德龙在第二、三局的开始时都曾一度领先，但因扣球失误较多而败北。
    最后一场阮克盛对姜永宁的比赛，紧紧吸引了全场的观众。善于削救险球的姜永宁在这场比赛中救起了观众认为无法挽救的不少险球。阮克盛能攻能守，抽救迅速有力，他的全面技术，也受到了观众的称赞。
    这次来我国访问的越南乒乓球队运动员是最近经过全国性的比赛选拔出来的，其中有干部、工人、军人、教师、学生、摄影师和护士，他们都是越南优秀的乒乓球运动员。
    越南乒乓球队还将到上海、广州、南宁、株州等地进行访问比赛。
