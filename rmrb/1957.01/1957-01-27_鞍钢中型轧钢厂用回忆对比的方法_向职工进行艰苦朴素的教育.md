Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 26th (Xinhua Reporter Xu Fang): Inspiring workers to think about the suffering of the past and compare it with the good life of the present has proven very effective in raising the political and ideological awareness of workers.

Before the Spring Festival, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Medium Rolling Mill widely launched a political and ideological education campaign focused on hard work and plain living among its employees. They organized various report meetings, forums, exhibitions, and home visits to help a small number of workers correct the emerging undesirable tendencies of extravagance, competition in lifestyle, and vying for ostentation.

Recently, after work, groups of workers have been flocking to the club to view the Party History Exhibition. Over a hundred pictures depicting the struggle and life during the arduous years of the Chinese revolution have made a deep impression on the workers; some workers have seen them once and then seen them again. Many workers, upon seeing the scene of Chairman Mao living in a cave dwelling, said excitedly: "We have houses today and still complain they are not spacious enough, and we still ask the factory for houses, which is really unreasonable." The scenes of the martyrs heroically fighting the enemy and generously sacrificing themselves also educated them. Worker Liu Youcheng said, "So much of the martyrs' blood was exchanged for today's good life, how can we forget the tradition of diligence and thrift? Now China produces very little steel, our steelworkers should work harder to catch up with the world's advanced level."

After the exhibition of the Chinese Communist Party History, the phenomenon of a few employees clamoring and complaining that the factory did not give them houses has disappeared. Worker Li Beimin used to complain that one room was too small and cried to the Party Committee for a house; now he says that being a little crowded is fine, and he no longer wants a house.

In the past month, the Party organization of the Medium Rolling Mill has organized a large force to give reports to workers and to visit workers' families, which has also solved many ideological problems. Workers said: "Life is getting better every day, and it should continue to get better. It's too much to pursue excessive enjoyment. Thanks to the Party Secretary for reminding us." Li Huimin, the chairman of the trade union of the Medium Rolling Mill, is an old worker who has worked in this factory for twenty-three years. When he described his own bitter days before liberation to the workers, the meeting place was so quiet that there was not a sound. The young workers who grew up in the new society said: "The chairman of the trade union used to use a few potatoes as a meal, and now we eat health-care meals and still complain that they have no taste, which is really not right." They were very moved to hear that the chairman of the trade union was burned on the leg in the past and no one cared, and that he was hungry every day. Thinking about the various benefits in the factory now, they are all satisfied.

In the past, when workers talked, they always compared whose radio was better and whose bicycle was newer; now they talk more about production. When they discussed this year's national plan, they put forward a total of eight hundred and ninety-eight rationalization proposals for improving production, which, after review, have been integrated into two hundred and ninety-six technical measures.

Among the families of workers, the past trend of competing with each other for ostentation and lifestyle has also changed. In the past, if a family did not have the "four major items" – a watch, a bicycle, a radio, and a sewing machine – it seemed like a disgraceful thing. After the education of diligence and thrift, the families of the workers no longer compete for the "four major items." Before the Spring Festival, a group of workers' families originally planned to go to get collective perms, but they no longer did so. The families of the workers said that they would learn to manage their households diligently and thriftily in the future.

    鞍钢中型轧钢厂用回忆对比的方法
    向职工进行艰苦朴素的教育
    新华社鞍山26日电　新华社记者徐放报道：启发工人想想过去苦难的日子，比比现在美好的生活，这种回忆生活的方法对于提高工人政治思想水平收效很好。
    春节前，鞍钢中型轧钢厂运用这种方法在职工中广泛地展开了以艰苦朴素为内容的政治思想教育。他们组织了各种报告会、座谈会、展览会和家庭访问，帮助少数工人纠正已经发生的铺张浪费、比生活、赛排场的不良倾向。
    近来每当下班以后，这个工厂总有成群的工人赶往俱乐部去观看党史展览会。一百多张表现中国革命在艰苦年代里的斗争生活图片，给工人们以深刻的印象，有的工人看过一遍再看一遍。不少工人看到毛主席住窑洞的情景时，激动地说：咱们今天有了房子还嫌不宽敞，仍向厂里要房子真是讲不过去。图片中先烈们和敌人英勇斗争，慷慨就义的场面也教育了他们。工人刘有成说：“多少烈士的鲜血换来了今天的好日子，咱们怎么能忘记了勤俭朴素的传统呢。现在中国生产的钢还很少，咱们钢铁工人就应该加油干才能赶上世界的先进水平。”
    中共党史展览会展出以后，过去少数职工吵吵嚷嚷埋怨厂里不给房子的那种现象，已经没有了。工人李北敏过去住一间房嫌太小，到党委哭着要房子；现在他说稍为挤一点也行，不再要房子了。
    近一个月来，中型轧钢厂的党组织组织了大批力量，向工人作报告，深入到工人家庭去访问，也解决了不少思想问题。工人说：生活一天好似一天，好了还要好，追求享受太过分了，多亏党委书记提醒了咱们。中型轧钢厂的工会主席李惠民是在这个厂里干了二十三年活的老工人，当他向工人们叙述解放前自己的辛酸日子的时候，会场上静得没有一点声音。在新社会里成长的青年工人说：工会主席过去用几个土豆就当一顿饭，咱们现在吃着保健饭还嫌没有味，这真是太不应该了。他们听到工会主席过去烧伤了腿没有人管，天天挨饿的情形非常感动，想想现在厂里的各种福利，也都满意了。
    过去工人在交谈的时候，总是互相比较谁的收音机好，谁的自行车新；现在更多地谈起生产来了。他们在讨论今年的国家计划时，一共提出了八百九十八件改进生产的合理化建议，经过审查之后，已经综合成为二百九十六件技术措施。
    在工人家属中也改变了过去互相赛排场、比生活的风气。过去谁家没有四大件——手表、自行车、收音机、缝纫机，好像就是不光彩的事情。经过勤俭朴素的教育以后，工人家属也不再比赛四大件了。春节前，本来有一批工人家属要集体去烫发，现在不再这样做了。工人家属们表示今后要学会勤俭治家。
