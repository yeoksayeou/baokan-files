Neither "Secretary System" nor "All-Encompassing"
Guo Longchun

Currently, some enterprise leaders view the factory director (manager) responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee as a "secretary leadership system," seeing it as a system like the one-leader system where the secretary alone "controls all power." As a result, some enterprise Party committee secretaries are hesitant to actively promote changes in the enterprise leadership system, fearing that pushing too hard will lead people to believe they are "eager to seize power." Some administrative leaders, on the other hand, believe that implementing the factory director (manager) responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee is tantamount to the factory director "handing over power" to the Party committee secretary. This has led to negative sentiment, with everything, big or small, being pushed onto the secretary's shoulders. Some cadres even say, "Some factory directors are skilled in their business and could lead the enterprise in the past; but the Party committee secretary doesn't understand technology, how can he lead?"

Still others equate the factory director (manager) responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee with the "all-encompassing leadership" of the Party committee that existed in some enterprises in the past. The mere mention of collective leadership by the Party committee raises concerns that the Party committee will inevitably take on everything and do everything itself. Some workshop Party branch secretaries are even considering whether every order issued by the workshop director needs to be discussed by the branch committee. Some leading personnel in small factories in Henan Province even say, "In the past, all our affairs were decided by the Party general branch after discussion, so what kind of leadership system transformation is needed now?" They simply regard the Party organization's past "all-encompassing" leadership as the factory director (manager) responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee. The collective leadership of the Party committee is first and foremost *not* the secretary personally "controlling all power" and deciding everything. Although the secretary bears a relatively heavy responsibility, he is ultimately a member of the Party committee collective; the decision of major issues requires collective discussion by the Party committee. This is also where the superiority of the factory director (manager) responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee lies over the one-leader system. If the factory director (manager) responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee is regarded as a "secretary leadership system," then it is merely replacing the one-leader system with a different person and a different name. Once this point is clarified, there is naturally no need to worry about "seizing power" or "handing over power," nor to worry that the secretary's lack of familiarity with technology will prevent him from leading.

As everyone knows, the system of division of labor with individual responsibility under the collective leadership of the Party committee embodies the principle of combining collective leadership of the Party with individual responsibility, and neither can be neglected. In order to give play to the enthusiasm of all personnel and ensure the smooth progress of work, there must be an appropriate division of labor in daily work, and the Party organization should not take over routine administrative affairs. According to my understanding, the correct leadership method in enterprises should be: major issues in the enterprise should be fully discussed at the Party committee meeting, relying on collective wisdom and experience to make decisions; then, Party, Youth League, trade union, and administrative leaders should separately be responsible for organizing and implementing the part of the work that they are responsible for, according to the principle of individual responsibility. As for daily production, administrative affairs, and technical work, they should all be handled independently by the enterprise's administrative leaders, and the Party organization should not only not interfere but also provide support in all aspects. Urgent issues that need to be decided and handled quickly should also be handled by the enterprise's administrative leaders, with the Party committee providing support.

Now, the key is to first resolve ideological problems, clarify various vague understandings, and truly understand the spirit and essence of the factory director (manager) responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee. This is not only a weapon to overcome ideological obstacles, but also a guarantee for the correct implementation of this leadership system.

    既非“书记制”，也非“一揽子”
    郭龙春
    现在，有一些企业领导干部把党委集体领导下的厂长（经理）负责制看作是“书记领导制”，看作像一长制那样由书记一个人来“总揽大权”，因此，使得有些企业的党委书记不敢积极地去促进企业领导制度的改变，怕抓得紧了，会让人认为自己是“急于攫权”。有的行政领导干部则认为实行党委集体领导下的厂长（经理）负责制，是厂长向党委书记“交权”。因而产生了消极情绪，不论大事小事都推到书记头上。有的干部还这样说：“某些厂长业务熟习，过去可以领导企业；党委书记不懂技术，他怎么能领导起来呢！”
    还有一些人又把党委集体领导下的厂长（经理）负责制和过去部分企业的党委“一揽子领导”混同起来。一提党委集体领导，就担心难免党委要包办代替。有的工厂的车间党支部书记也真的在考虑车间主任下的每道命令，是否都要经过支部委员会讨论。河南省有些小工厂的领导人员甚至说：“过去我们所有的事情都是党总支讨论决定的，现在还要转变什么领导体制呢？”他们干脆把过去党组织“一揽子”领导看成了党委集体领导下的厂长（经理）负责制。党委集体领导首先就不是书记个人“总揽大权”，决定一切。虽然书记担负着比较重大的责任，但是他终究是党委这个集体中的一分子；重大问题的决定，都需要党委作集体讨论。这也是党委集体领导下的厂长（经理）负责制优越于一长制的根本所在，如果把党委集体领导下的厂长（经理）负责制当作“书记领导制”，那就只是把一长制换个人、换个名称而已。弄清这一点，自然就不必顾虑什么“攫权”、“交权”，也不用担心书记对技术不熟悉而领导不起来了。
    大家也知道，党委集体领导下的分工负责制，贯穿着党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的原则，二者不可偏废。为了发挥各方面工作人员的积极性，保证工作的顺利进行，在日常工作中必须有适当的分工，党组织不应该包办日常行政事务。据我的了解，在企业里，正确的领导方法应该是：企业中的重大问题都在党委会上进行充分讨论，依靠集体的智慧和经验，做出决定；然后由党、青年团、工会和行政领导人员分头按照个人负责的原则，负责组织执行他所担任的那部分工作。至于日常生产、行政事务和技术工作，应该一律由企业行政领导人员独立负责处理，党组织不仅不加干涉，还要从各方面给以支持。紧急的问题需要当机立断、迅速处理的，也应该由企业行政领导人员负责处理，党委给以支持。
    现在，问题的关键在于首先解决思想问题，澄清各种模糊认识，真正领会党委集体领导下的厂长（经理）负责制的精神实质。这既是克服思想障碍的武器，也是使这个领导制度得以正确贯彻实行的保证。
