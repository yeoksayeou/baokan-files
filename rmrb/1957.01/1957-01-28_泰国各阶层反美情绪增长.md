Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, January 27th: According to reports in Thai newspapers, anti-American sentiment is growing among the people of the country.

    "Siam Mass News" wrote that Thai public opinion believes that Americans are trying hard to control all aspects of Thai life, including politics, economy, and education. This is the basic reason for the growing anti-American sentiment among the Thai people. The newspaper pointed out that anti-American sentiment is now growing not only in the business community, intellectuals, and students, but also in the military and government officials. The newspaper quoted a Thai military officer as saying painfully that now "any U.S. Army corporal knows more military secrets of the Thai army than some Thai generals do."

    "Thai News," "Free Communications," and "Eternal News" criticized the United States for openly interfering in Thailand's internal affairs and pointed out that anti-American sentiment is growing rapidly, not only in Thailand but also in Asian countries, because the people of these countries increasingly desire peace and political and economic independence.

    泰国各阶层反美情绪增长
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社曼谷27日讯：泰国报纸报道这个国家人民的反美情绪正在增长。
    “暹罗群众报”写道，泰国舆论认为，美国人极力想控制泰国生活的一切方面，包括政治、经济和教育。这就是使得泰国人民反美情绪增长的基本原因。这家报纸指出，反美情绪现在不只是在工商业界、知识分子和学生中滋长，在军队和政府官员中也滋长起来。报纸引用了泰国一位军官的谈话，这位军官痛心地说，现在“美军任何一个伍长所知道的泰国军队的军事机密，比泰国某些将军所知道的还多”。
    “泰报”、“自由通讯报”、“永恒报”批评美国公开干涉泰国内政，并且指出，现在反美情绪在急剧增长，不仅泰国如此，亚洲各国都是这样，因为这些国家的人民日益希望和平和在政治、经济上独立。
