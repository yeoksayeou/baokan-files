An Example of Improving Leadership Methods

Last year, the Dongxiang County Committee of Jiangxi Province transferred a group of experienced cadres from the county-level leading organs to participate in grassroots work in the countryside. Among them, thirteen county committee members spent an average of two-thirds of their time living in the countryside, living, eating, and laboring with the peasant masses. Chen Jiefu, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, moved to the Yousheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pogan Township last summer, where he lived and worked. This greatly strengthened the grassroots party organizations, and as a result, a new atmosphere emerged in rural work. Now, Dongxiang County is doing a good job in field management of winter crops, winter fertilization and manure accumulation, and the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects. The year-end dividends of all sixty advanced cooperatives in the county, except for two disaster-stricken cooperatives, were distributed fairly and reasonably, and the members generally expressed satisfaction. This proves that as long as the leading organs improve their leadership methods, rural work can be done well, the party's policies can be correctly implemented, and deviations or errors in work can be greatly reduced.

Since the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, party leading organs at all levels have been taking various measures to improve leadership methods, strengthen grassroots work, and overcome the bureaucratic and subjectivist tendencies of leading organs. The method adopted by the Dongxiang County Committee of Jiangxi Province mentioned above is a good example. Similar examples exist elsewhere. Many leading organs in various places have sent a large number of personnel to form inspection teams and work groups to go deep into factories and rural areas to understand the situation and promote work. Many provinces and counties have transferred some district-level cadres who are familiar with the rural situation and relatively experienced, as well as a few county-level cadres, to serve as general branch secretaries of townships. This practice is worth promoting. Personnel from leading organs, especially responsible personnel, going down to the countryside and factories can promptly and deeply understand the situation and discover problems, and promptly help the lower levels overcome difficulties and prevent mistakes. Of course, when sending out inspection teams and work groups, they should be reminded to not just point fingers and nitpick after going down, without helping to solve problems, or taking over and undermining the enthusiasm of the lower-level cadres.

The method of the Dongxiang County Committee is a better method than sending work groups. Because the comrades who are transferred to work at the lower level have a stronger sense of responsibility than temporary work groups, and it is also easier for them to systematically understand the situation and connect with the masses. For leading organs to grasp the situation, discover problems, and strengthen specific leadership over the grassroots, it is not enough to rely solely on sending work groups. Especially at present, the strength of grassroots organizations is very weak, while the leading organs are bloated and overstaffed. In this case, it is best to take a two-pronged approach: both transferring cadres to strengthen the grassroots and frequently sending people deep into the lower levels to understand the situation. This is also in line with the principle of streamlining the structure of the various levels of organs.

In the past year or two, the number of county-level and above party and government organs and financial and economic systems in many regions has been increasing and expanding, while the work in many villages—specific leadership over thousands of agricultural production cooperatives—has shown an undue weakening. Many organs above the county level have expanded rapidly, but the efficiency of the work of many organs has decreased relatively or even absolutely. Things that could be done quickly by one section chief in the past now take several section chiefs who shirk responsibility and delay things. The massive increase in many dispensable departments and institutions inevitably leads to confusion in departmental business and complexity in internal affairs of the organs. The meetings that leaders are forced to attend, the documents they are forced to handle, and the affairs they are forced to participate in inevitably increase greatly, and the opportunities to go deep into the grassroots and connect with the people inevitably decrease greatly.

This top-heavy phenomenon should be changed quickly. The improvement of people's lives and the development of national construction require a more rapid increase in agricultural production, but this top-heavy phenomenon greatly hinders the improvement of the work of agricultural cooperatives and hinders the increase in agricultural production. Therefore, we must now quickly find a way to change this top-heavy phenomenon. The method adopted by the Dongxiang County Committee is one of the most effective methods. This method can be promoted in various places as appropriate.

Some people believe that there is a lack of guidance in rural work now, and cadres should be promoted from rural party members and the masses, rather than reducing and shrinking the upper-level organs. We believe that this view is incorrect. Others believe that we should now prepare cadres for future major development. This statement is also incorrect. Generally speaking, future development certainly requires cadres. However, there are a few points worth considering: First, is it the near future or the distant future? If it is the need of the distant future, it cannot be considered an immediate need now. Second, even in the distant future, it is not necessary to increase a large number of administrative and non-production personnel in addition to production personnel, which can only hinder the development of production. Third, cadres who truly need to be cultivated and trained now cannot be expected to grow in positions where there is nothing to do or very little work to do. If you insist on finding some unnecessary work for them to do, you still cannot enable them to learn the knowledge and skills they will truly need in the future.

Some comrades also believe that doing socialism must "look the part," and so-called "looking the part" means establishing a large and complex structure. These comrades are wrong. One of the most important principles of socialism is to achieve rapid accumulation through economy; while a large and complex upper-level structure is a great waste, so it violates the spirit and principles of socialism.

The organizational form is subordinate to the political task. We should not forget that our current basic political task is to develop the productive forces. Leaders and staff in any organization should consider how much real help their organization and their work provide for the development of productive forces; if the same personnel can more effectively help the development of productive forces at the lower level, then such personnel should be resolutely transferred to the lower level.

### 改进领导方法的一例

    改进领导方法的一例
    江西省东乡县委去年从县级领导机关中，抽调了一批有经验的干部，去参加乡村基层工作。其中有十三个县委委员平均都有三分之二的时间住在乡村，跟农民群众同住、同吃、同劳动。县委副书记陈接福同志在去年夏季就搬到珀玕乡优胜农业生产合作社去，在那里生活和劳动。这样就大大地充实了基层党组织的力量，因而使农村工作出现了新气象。现在东乡县对于冬季作物的田间管理、对于冬季施肥和积肥的工作、对于小型水利工程的建设，都进行得很好。全县六十个高级社的年终分红，除了两个受灾的社以外，都分得公平合理，社员普遍表示满意。这证明，只要领导机关改进领导方法，农村工作就一定可以作得好，党的政策就可以正确地贯彻执行，工作中的偏差或错误就可以大大减少。
    党的第八次全国代表大会和八届二中全会以后，各级党的领导机关都在采取各种措施，改进领导方法，加强基层工作，克服领导机关的官僚主义和主观主义倾向。上述江西省东乡县委采取的办法，就是一个很好的例子。同类的例子在其他地方也有。各地都有不少领导机关已经派出大批人员组成视察团、工作组深入到工厂、农村去了解情况，推动工作。许多省、县都抽调了一些熟悉农村情况、比较有经验的区级干部和少数县级干部去担任乡的总支书记。这种作法是值得提倡的。领导机关的人员特别是负责人员下乡下厂，就可以及时地深入地了解情况和发现问题，及时地帮助下边克服困难和防止错误。当然，在派出视察团、工作组的时候，应该注意提醒他们，在下去以后，不要只是指手划脚和挑剔毛病，而不帮助解决问题，或者包办代替，影响下边干部的积极性。
    东乡县委的作法比起派遣工作组来说，是一种更好的办法。因为，抽调到下边去担任工作的同志，比起临时派去的工作组，责任心更强一些，也更容易系统地了解情况和联系群众。领导机关为了掌握情况，发现问题，加强对基层的具体领导，单靠派工作组是不够的。特别是目前，基层组织的力量很弱，领导机关却机构臃肿，人浮于事。在这种情况下，最好是双管齐下，既抽调干部充实基层，又经常派人深入下层了解情况。这对于各级机关的精简机构的原则也是适合的。
    近一两年来，许多地区的县级和县级以上党政机关和财经系统的机构日益增多和扩大，而许多乡村中的工作——对于千万个农业生产合作社的具体领导，却表现了不应有的减弱。县以上的许多机关迅速地扩大起来，但是许多机关工作的效率却相对地甚至绝对地降低了。从前设一个科长就能够很快办了的事，现在有了几个科长，却互相推诿，把事情延误了。许多可要可不要的部门和机构大量增设的结果，必然引起部门业务的混乱，机关内部事务的繁杂。领导人员被迫参加的会议、被迫处理的文牍和被迫参预的事务，必然随之大增，深入基层的机会和联系人民群众的机会，必然随之大减。
    这种头重脚轻的现象应该赶快改变。人民生活的改善和国家建设事业的发展，都要求农业方面更迅速地增产，而这种头重脚轻的现象却大大地妨害着农业合作社工作的改善，妨害着农业的增产。因此，现在要赶快想办法，改变这种头重脚轻的现象。东乡县委所采用的办法就是最有效的办法之一。这种办法各地都可以酌情推广。
    有的人认为现在乡村工作缺人指导，应当从乡村党员和群众中提拔干部，而不应当减少和缩小上层机构。我们以为这种意见是不正确的。还有的人认为现在就要给将来的大发展准备干部。这种说法也是不对的。一般地说，将来的发展当然需要干部。但是，有几点值得考虑：第一、是最近的将来，还是较远的将来？如果是较远的将来的需要，就不能认为是现在的急需。第二、即使是较远的将来，也不一定需要在生产人员之外大量地增加行政事务人员和非生产人员，那样只能妨碍生产的发展。第三、真正是现在就需要着手培养和训练的干部，也不能希望他们在无事可作或工作极少的岗位上成长。如果硬找出一些并非必需的工作给他们作，也还是不能使他们学到将来真正需要的知识和技能。
    还有一些同志以为搞社会主义必须“像个样子”，而所谓“像个样子”就是建立一套庞大繁杂的机构。这些同志想错了。社会主义的最重要原则之一是以节约达到迅速的积累；而上层机构庞大繁杂却是一种极大的浪费，所以也就违反社会主义的精神和原则。
    组织形式是服从政治任务的。不应当忘记我们目前的基本政治任务是发展生产力。任何组织机构中的领导者和工作人员，都应当考虑一下，自己所在的机构和自己所从事的工作，对于发展生产力究竟有多少真实的帮助；如果同样的人员放在下层就能更有效地帮助生产力的发展，那就应当坚决地把这样的人员转移到下层去。
