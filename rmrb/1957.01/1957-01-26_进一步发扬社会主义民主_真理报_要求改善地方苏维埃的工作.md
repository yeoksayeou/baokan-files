Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th: Preparations are actively underway throughout the Soviet Union for elections to local Soviets at all levels. An editorial published in "Pravda" on the 24th pointed out that these elections will further promote socialist democracy. Therefore, during the election process, criticism of the activities of local Soviets and their staff will be more stringent, and the requirements for nominated candidates will be greatly increased. The editorial demanded that local Soviet bodies at all levels must treat healthy and positive criticism with the utmost sincerity and must immediately take effective measures to eliminate existing shortcomings. When nominating candidates, it is necessary to be cautious and not to act rashly, but to conduct in-depth and extensive discussions among the working people. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that workers and collective farmers are more widely elected to the Soviets.

The "Pravda" editorial, titled "Improve the Work of Local Soviets and Strengthen Their Ties with the Masses," stated that the 20th Congress of the CPSU required party organizations at all levels to pay attention to enlivening the work of the Soviets of Working People's Deputies and to enhance their role in economic and cultural construction, in meeting the daily needs of residents, and in the cause of communist education of the working people.

The editorial said that the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee in December of last year pointed out the need to enhance the role and power of local bodies in solving specific problems of economic and cultural construction. After listing the various tasks that local Soviets must perform in this regard, the editorial pointed out that in order for local Soviets to complete these tasks and fully utilize their constantly expanding powers, it is necessary to strengthen their ties with the masses, thoroughly implement the democratic principles in Soviet work, and ensure that meetings are held regularly and that the scope of issues discussed at these meetings is greatly expanded.

The editorial emphasized that the work arrangements for Soviet meetings should be realistic and pragmatic, ensuring the broad development of criticism and self-criticism, enabling representatives to fully and calmly discuss the issues raised, offer their own views and suggestions, and pose inquiries to executive bodies and economic leaders, and receive detailed answers to these inquiries. After each meeting, representatives should routinely meet with their constituents, inform them of the decisions adopted at the meeting, and organize the implementation of the resolutions in various localities.

    进一步发扬社会主义民主
    “真理报”要求改善地方苏维埃的工作
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：目前苏联各地正在积极准备举行各级地方苏维埃选举。“真理报”24日发表的社论指出，这次选举将进一步发扬社会主义民主。因此，在选举过程中，对地方苏维埃以及它们的工作人员的活动的批评将更加严厉，对被提名的候选人的要求将大大提高。社论要求各级地方苏维埃机关必须以最恳切的态度对待健康和积极的批评，必须立即采取有效措施消灭现存的缺点。在提候选人的时候，必须慎重，不允许草率从事，必须在劳动人民中间进行深入和广泛的讨论，同时，必须保证工人和集体农民更广泛地被选入苏维埃。
    “真理报”在这篇题为“改善地方苏维埃的工作，加强它们同群众的联系”的社论中说，苏共第二十次代表大会要求各级党组织注意活跃劳动人民代表苏维埃的工作，提高它们在经济和文化建设中、在满足居民日常需要上、在对劳动人民进行共产主义教育事业中的作用。
    社论说，苏共中央去年12月全体会议指出，有必要提高地方机关在解决经济和文化建设的具体问题上的作用和权力。社论在列举了地方苏维埃在这方面必须做的各方面工作以后指出，为了使地方苏维埃能完成这些任务，充分利用自己的正在不断扩大的权力，必须加强它们同群众的联系，彻底贯彻苏维埃工作中的民主原则，必须做到定期召开会议，大大扩大这些会议讨论的问题的范围。
    社论强调说，苏维埃会议的工作安排应当是实事求是的，可以保证广泛地开展批评与自我批评，使代表们有可能全面地、从容地讨论所提出的问题，并且提出自己的看法和建议，向执行机关和经济领导人提出质询，并且得到对这些质询的详尽答复。在每次会议以后，代表们照例应当同自己的选民会见，告诉他们会议通过的决定，在各地组织决议的执行。
