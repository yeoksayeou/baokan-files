Xinhua News Agency, January 27th -- TASS, New York, January 27th: American newspapers continue to publish readers' letters and articles opposing the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    Neil, an observer for the Los Angeles "Times," wrote that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" can be described as "a new step in Western colonialism." Neil pointed out the great changes taking place in the Middle East and warned that "if the United States wants to replace the British Empire in this region and play its former police role," it will not only be defeated, but "will involve us in extremely costly military and other adventures in the Middle East in the future."

    White, a reader of the "Commercial and Financial Chronicle," pointed out in a letter to the newspaper that the assertion that the United States should fill the "vacuum" in the Middle East "reminds one of the political claims of 18th-century Britain." White asked, "Is there really a vacuum in the Middle East that needs to be filled?" He himself answered that the Arab countries are capable of managing their own affairs and will undoubtedly resist any coercive policies of any other country.

    Retired Brigadier General Hearst, in a letter published in the "Christian Science Monitor," condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine's use of open threats of force to maintain the status quo of American rule."

Xinhua News Agency, January 28th -- Tokyo Dispatch: Charles Edmondson, an official of the United States Information Agency stationed in Seoul, stated to the press in Tokyo on the 27th that Eisenhower's Middle East policy "may lead us over the edge and into atomic war."

    He said that Eisenhower "is asking for a blank check to start a war whenever he sees fit...This is tantamount to asking Congress to relinquish the responsibility and privileges entrusted to it by the Constitution."

    Edmondson opposed the United States establishing atomic bases in other countries, saying: "President Eisenhower and no other American would allow others to establish atomic bases near us. We have no moral or inherent international right to go thousands of miles away from our coast and establish such bases under the noses of other countries."

    Edmondson also spoke about the State Department's decision not to allow American journalists to visit China. He said that this was probably because "the State Department is afraid that journalists will reveal the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency or other intelligence personnel operating there."

    He also criticized the so-called "aid" the United States provides to South Korea, saying that South Korean farmers have to buy American fertilizer at one and a half times the specified price, even though this American fertilizer was supposedly going to be sold to South Korean farmers cheaply.

    Edmondson also submitted a written statement to the United States Information Agency in Washington through the American Embassy in Japan, saying that if the General Administration believes that his free expression of opinions "violates discipline," then he intends to resign.

    美国公众反对在中东冒险
    “艾森豪威尔主义”在国内继续挨骂
    在别国建立原子基地计划也遭到谴责
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社纽约27日讯：美国报纸上继续刊登反对“艾森豪威尔主义”的读者来信和文章。
    洛杉矶出版的“时报”的观察家尼耳写道，“艾森豪威尔主义”可以说是“西方殖民主义新的一步”。尼耳指出中东发生的伟大变化，并且警告说，“美国要是想在这一地区代替英帝国担任它以前的警察角色”，那不仅仅要遭到失败，而且“会使我们将来卷入中东地区的代价极大的军事冒险和其他冒险中”。
    “商业金融记事报”的读者怀特在写给报纸的信里指出，关于美国应当填补中东地区的“真空”的说法“使人们想起了十八世纪英国的政治主张”。怀特问道，“中东真有真空需要填补吗？”他自己回答说，阿拉伯国家有能力管理自己的事务，同时也无可争辩地会给任何其他国家的强迫政策以反击。
    退休的准将赫斯特在“基督教科学箴言报”上发表的信里谴责“艾森豪威尔主义以公开使用武力进行威胁，来保持美国统治的现状”。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：驻汉城的美国新闻署官员查尔斯·艾德蒙逊27日在东京向新闻界发表声明，指责艾森豪威尔的中东政策“可能引导我们越过边缘而走入原子战争”。
    他说，艾森豪威尔“要求获得一张空白支票以便在他认为适合的时候发动战争……这等于是要求国会放弃宪法所交给它的责任和特权”。
    艾德蒙逊反对美国在别国建立原子基地，他说：“艾森豪威尔总统和任何其他美国人都不会让别人在临近我们的地方建立原子基地。我们没有道义的或固有的国际权利去到远离我们海岸千里之外，在别国的鼻子底下建立这种基地。”
    艾德蒙逊也谈到了美国国务院不许美国记者访问中国的决定。他说，这很可能是由于“国务院害怕记者们会透露在那里进行活动的中央情报局或其他谍报人员的活动”。
    他还指责美国对南朝鲜的所谓“援助”，他说，南朝鲜的农民不得不以比规定价格高一倍半的代价来购买美国的肥料，而这种美国肥料本来说的是要廉价售给南朝鲜农民的。
    艾德蒙逊还通过美国驻日本大使馆向华盛顿美国新闻署签具一个书面声明说，如果总署认为他的自由表达意见“有违纪律”，那末，他就打算辞职不干。
