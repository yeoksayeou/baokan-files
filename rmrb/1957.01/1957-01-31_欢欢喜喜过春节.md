    Happily Celebrate the Spring Festival
    Xinhua News Agency collective writing
    Entering the latter part of January, the rural areas of Shandong, having achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, began busily preparing for the Spring Festival. In the thousands of supply and marketing cooperative branches and retail stores spread throughout the countryside, salespersons were serving twice as many customers as usual. Many agricultural cooperatives were conducting their final distribution before the holiday, ensuring that members had ample grain and cash to enjoy the Spring Festival. More than 20,000 rural amateur theater troupes, singing and dancing groups, and folk art groups throughout the province were also busy preparing for cultural and recreational activities during the Spring Festival. Everyone wanted to celebrate the first Spring Festival after collectivization even better than in previous years.

    When reporters recently visited the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative in Ju County, led by national agricultural labor model Lü Hongbin, the cooperative was distributing 22,000 yuan in cash, 6,000 jin of wheat, 10,000 jin of soybeans, and 18,000 jin of peanuts to its members for the Spring Festival. The cooperative's fifty "five-guarantee" households each received five jin of wheat, one jin of pork, and half a jin of bean vermicelli. The Spring Festival has always been a good time for young men and women in rural areas to get married. In the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative, fifty-seven young members were getting married before the Spring Festival. Reporters interviewed a young couple scheduled to marry on the 29th. The man was named Lü Chunman, and the woman was named Du Yingxiu. They were both in the same production team and were both skilled laborers. The bride had accumulated a total of one hundred and sixty workdays last year. She had used her earnings to buy Lü Chunman a hat, make very nice cotton shoes and single shoes, and also made herself brand-new cotton clothes and shoes with fine serge fabric.

    In the Yue Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yishui County in the Yimeng Mountains, some impatient children had already put on their new clothes for the festival, and the sound of firecrackers was already sporadically heard. The cooperative was preparing to take money from the public welfare fund to buy some pork, and they had also prepared some wheat to慰问 the eighty-three households of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the cooperative. The honorary lanterns and Spring Festival couplets had also been prepared for the families of martyrs and soldiers. These eighty-three households of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers had also received good incomes last year, just like other members. Zhang Wenle, a family member of a martyr, barely had enough grain to eat when he was outside the cooperative two years ago. Last year, he received a total of 2,600 jin of grain and more than 70 yuan in cash in the cooperative, becoming a surplus grain household. Now, his entire family of six had prepared six jin of pork and more than thirty jin of white flour for the festival. In the home of Wang Riqing, a family member of a martyr, his four children were vying to try on their new clothes. Sister-in-law Wang, who was helping the children try on their clothes, said with a smile to the reporter: "The cooperative gave us a prosperous year."

    The Shimensong Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, known throughout the country for raising pigs to fertilize the fields, not only supplied 750 fat pigs to other places for the Spring Festival, but also slaughtered 342 fat pigs in the cooperative, with each member receiving an average of three jin of meat. In the past, Yanggu County and the neighboring ShouZhang County had no habit of raising pigs. When celebrating the Spring Festival last year, the two counties transported more than 350,000 jin of meat from other places, which only amounted to more than one jin of meat per person. But this year it is very different. In recent days, the 192 agricultural cooperatives in the two counties have been slaughtering pigs in every cooperative and sheep in every team. Moreover, since entering the twelfth lunar month, the two counties have been shipping batches of pork out every day. Up to now, more than 770,000 jin of various meats have been supplied to nearby urban and rural areas.

    When reporters came to the Shandong Peninsula, staff from the supply and marketing cooperatives were constantly purchasing and transporting New Year's goods for the farmers amidst heavy snowfall. The farmers of Sujiazhuang in Qixia County were worried that the snow covering the mountain roads would prevent them from going down the mountain to buy New Year's goods. Unexpectedly, the salesperson from the Taocun Supply and Marketing Cooperative climbed the slippery mountain road and delivered the New Year's goods to their doorsteps. The various primary markets in this hilly area have also been particularly active recently. Every market day, under the street walls, on the small stalls, and in the baskets of people going to the market, Spring Festival couplets, window paper-cuts, firecrackers, colorful clay dolls... were all kinds of things. In the most recent market day in Taocun, the supply and marketing cooperative sold more than 17,000 yuan worth of goods. Including small vendors and farmer trade, the total transaction volume of the entire market reached more than 30,000 yuan.

    During festivals, the busiest are always the women. They are busy pushing mills, pressing rollers, making tofu, pasting windows, and rushing to make new clothes. In the Shanqiandian Township of Laiyang County, the villages have been lit up every night recently, as the women are pushing mills and pressing rollers after a day of work. In order to reduce the labor of the female members, the agricultural cooperative of this township has specially allocated some livestock to help the members push mills and press rollers. In Gaotang County, a cotton-producing area in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, women used to rarely leave the house except to pick cotton. But this year, young women account for half of the total number of people in the county's three hundred and thirty-six amateur theater troupes and many singing teams, dance teams, and folk art groups. They will be showing their skills in the Spring Festival performances. Wang Jinlan, a female member of the Hongliang Agricultural Cooperative, and her younger sister-in-law Dong Chunrong used to never work in the fields, but last year they accumulated a total of more than five hundred and twenty workdays in the cooperative and also became active members of the cooperative. Now, the two sisters-in-law are rehearsing the play "Virtuous Sister-in-Law," and appropriately divide the roles of the sister-in-law in the play according to their own identities.

    欢欢喜喜过春节
    新华社记者集体采写
    进入1月下旬，去年获得空前丰收的山东农村就开始为迎接春节而忙碌起来。遍布农村的上万个供销合作社的门市部和零售店里，售货员们接待着要比平时多一倍的顾客。许多农业社在进行着节日前的最后一次分配，好让社员们有充裕的粮食和现款来欢度春节。全省的两万多个农村业余剧团、歌咏舞蹈小组、曲艺小组等，也在忙着筹备春节期间的文娱活动。人们都想把合作化以后的第一个春节，过得比往年更好。
    当记者日前到全国农业劳动模范吕鸿宾所领导的莒县爱国农业社去的时候，社里正在把二万二千元现款、六千斤小麦、一万斤大豆和一万八千斤花生分给社员过春节。这个社的五十户“五保”户，每个人也都分到五斤小麦、一斤猪肉和半斤粉皮。春节，向来是农村青年男女办喜事的好日子，在爱国农业社里，春节前结婚的青年社员就有五十七对。记者访问了定于29日结婚的一对青年男女，男的叫吕春满，女的叫杜英秀，他俩同在一个生产队里，又都是劳动能手。新娘去年一年共做了一百六十个劳动日，她已经用自己的劳动所得给吕春满买了一顶帽子，做了很讲究的棉鞋和单鞋，同时也给自己做了崭新的线哔叽面子的棉衣、棉裤和棉鞋。
    在沂蒙山区的沂水县岳庄农业社里，一些心急的儿童已经穿上了过节的新衣裳，鞭炮声也已经稀稀落落地响了起来。这个社正准备从公益金里拿钱买些猪肉，另外还准备了一些小麦，来慰问社里的八十三户烈军属。光荣灯和春联也已经给烈军属们准备好了。这八十三户烈军属，去年也和别的社员一样，得到了好收入。烈属张文乐前年在社外的时候，收的粮食刚刚够吃，去年在社里一共分了两千六百斤粮食和七十多元现金，变成了余粮户，现在他们全家六口已经准备好了六斤猪肉和三十多斤白面过节。在烈属王日庆家里，他的四个孩子正在争着试穿新衣，给孩子们试衣的王大嫂笑着对记者说：“合作社给了一个富裕年。”
    以养猪肥田闻名全国的阳谷县石门宋乡农业社，除了把七百五十多头肥猪供应外地过春节以外，社里也杀了三百四十二头肥猪，平均每个社员分到了三斤肉。阳谷县和邻近的寿张县，过去一直都没有养猪习惯，去年过春节的时候，这两个县从外地运来三十五万多斤肉类，每人还只合到一斤多肉。可是今年就大不一样了。近几天，两个县的一百九十二个农业社，社社杀猪，队队宰羊。而且在进入旧历腊月以来，这两个县每天都有成批的猪肉外运，到现在为止，供应附近城乡的各种肉类已经有七十七万多斤。
    当记者来到山东半岛的时候，供销合作社的工作人员正在大雪纷飞中不停地为农民采办和运送年货。栖霞县苏家庄的农民，正在因为大雪盖住山路不能下山购买年货而着急，想不到桃村供销社的售货员爬着滑溜溜的山路，把年货送到了门上。这个丘陵地区的各个初级市场近来也显得格外活跃，每逢集日，在街墙下，在小摊上，在赶集人们的篮子里，春联、窗花、鞭炮、彩色的泥娃娃……，形形色色。在桃村的最近一个集日，供销社就卖出了一万七千多元的货物，连同小商贩和农民贸易，全集的交易额达到了三万多元。
    每逢节日，最忙的总是妇女们，她们忙着推磨压碾、做豆腐、糊窗户、赶制新衣。在莱阳县的山前店乡，近来每到晚上村里灯火闪烁，那都是妇女们在忙了一天以后，又在推磨压碾。这个乡的农业社为了减轻女社员们的劳动，特地拨出一些牲口来为社员推磨压碾。在黄河下游的产棉区高唐县，妇女们过去除了拾棉花以外就不大出门活动。但今年这个县的三百三十六个业余剧团和许多歌咏队、舞蹈队、曲艺小组里，青年妇女就占了总人数的一半，她们将要在春节演出中大显身手。宏亮农业社的女社员王金兰和她的小姑董春荣过去都从不下地，但去年她俩一共在社里做了五百二十多个劳动日，而且还成了社里的活跃分子。现在，她们姑嫂俩正在排练“小姑贤”这个戏剧，而且恰合自己身份地分担着剧中的姑嫂两个角色。
