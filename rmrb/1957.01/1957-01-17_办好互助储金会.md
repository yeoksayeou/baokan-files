Run Mutual Aid Savings Societies Well
    Yao Fu
    In recent years, with the active promotion of trade unions, mutual aid savings societies have been established in many enterprises. Mutual aid savings societies have played a significant role in solving many of the difficulties in the lives of workers. However, recently some trade union cadres have not only relaxed their leadership over mutual aid savings societies, but have even discussed whether this mutual aid organization is necessary.
    One argument is that mutual aid savings societies cannot solve major problems and are therefore unnecessary. This statement is one-sided. Of course, to solve major problems in the lives of workers, it is necessary to rely on state or enterprise administrative investment. However, the problems in the lives of workers are multifaceted. In addition to major issues such as housing, weddings and funerals, and hospitalization, there are also some minor problems that are difficult to anticipate, such as not having enough money to pay for children's school fees, a shortage of travel expenses to return home, and a lack of money to buy some daily necessities. These may seem like "small problems," but it would be wrong to require the administration to take care of all these "small problems." Because enterprise funds are limited, if the enterprise administration, in addition to paying monthly wages, also allocates a large sum of money to lend to workers, it will affect the turnover of enterprise funds, which will not only increase the difficulty of enterprise operation, but even increase the product cost of the enterprise. This is detrimental to the country and the people. However, if there is a mutual aid savings society, it can not only solve the temporary difficulties of workers and enable them to work with peace of mind, but also reduce many difficulties in administrative work, and not occupy the funds of the state and enterprises.
    In fact, the broad masses of workers strongly support the establishment of mutual aid savings societies. Some workers call mutual aid savings societies "timely rain," and some workers call mutual aid savings societies their own "small bank." This shows that mutual aid savings societies can also become one of the bridges for trade unions to connect with the masses, and can also promote the unity and mutual assistance of workers. It is also the most vivid and practical way to conduct communist education for workers.
    Some people think that the working masses already have spontaneous mutual aid habits, so why should the trade union "interfere" with it? This view is also incorrect. Of course, in old China, workers spontaneously organized mutual aid organizations to solve their economic difficulties. After liberation, the spontaneous organization of "sui hui" and "qing hui" by the working masses has also been discovered in various places. However, because this kind of mutual aid organization lacks leadership, it is very unstable, sometimes established and sometimes dissolved, and is often manipulated and used by bad elements, resulting in various malpractices. Therefore, trade unions should never allow the mutual aid savings societies of the working masses to take their own course, but should actively lead them to develop in the right direction, so that they can truly solve some of the difficulties that workers can solve themselves, thereby enhancing the mutual assistance and unity of workers.
    Some workers also have incorrect understandings of mutual aid savings societies. Some people want to borrow money from mutual aid savings societies at every turn, and they have to find mutual aid savings societies to solve any difficulties. When their requirements are not met, they are full of complaints. This is of course wrong. It should be recognized that mutual aid savings societies are economic mutual aid organizations established by the working masses to solve difficulties, but they are not relief organizations, and it is even more impossible to take care of all difficulties.
    The source of funds for mutual aid savings societies mainly relies on the funds paid by members. The trade union should mobilize every member who joins to complete the obligation of paying funds on time or exceeding the quota. The scope and limit of loans should not be stipulated too small or too low. Under the circumstances that the revolving fund is allowed, as long as the working masses do have difficulties in life needs, they should be lent money. In the past, some mutual aid savings societies stipulated that only those who enjoy subsidies can borrow mutual aid funds, which is wrong. Members should borrow and repay the loans from the mutual aid savings society, and mutual aid cannot be turned into subsidies, nor can debts be owed for a long time, which will affect the turnover of mutual aid funds. As for those workers who have major difficulties in life, need a large amount of money, and cannot repay it in a short period of time, the trade union should try to solve it from other aspects. If too much money is borrowed from the mutual aid savings society and not repaid for a long time, it will inevitably collapse. Therefore, the criteria for judging whether a mutual aid savings society is well-run should be: how large is the loan coverage, what is the role of the loan, and how high is the fund turnover rate; and not just how much money a certain person has borrowed.
    Some people think that the accounts of the mutual aid savings society should be kept confidential, because borrowers do not want to publish their names. This is not appropriate. Borrowing money is a legitimate thing, why be afraid to publish names? The common problem in mutual aid savings societies at present is that members do not know how much wealth the mutual aid savings society has and who the money has been lent to. Some mutual aid savings societies are called "muddled societies" by the masses because of unclear accounts. This kind of muddled society is obviously unacceptable. Mutual aid savings society is a matter for all members, not a matter for a few people. Therefore, the trade union should mobilize a large number of activists to participate in the work of the mutual aid savings society, regularly publicize the income and loan repayment situation of the mutual aid fund, publicize the gains of mutual aid, criticize the wrong behavior of those who delay repayment of loans without reason, and help members arrange family life, etc. In this way, the mutual aid savings society can truly become a mass economic mutual aid organization worthy of its name, and it can be consolidated and developed.
    In August 1956, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions revised the organizational rules of the mutual aid savings society. In this set of rules, the previous regulation that only trade union members could join the mutual aid savings society was changed, and non-trade union members could also participate; the membership fee was cancelled; the proportion of mutual aid funds paid by each person was reduced, and the loan procedures were simplified; the loan scope was expanded. These new regulations undoubtedly greatly contribute to running the mutual aid savings society well. It is hoped that local trade unions and grassroots trade unions will earnestly summarize the existing experience, mobilize the masses, and run the mutual aid savings society well.

### 办好互助储金会

    办好互助储金会
    药夫
    近几年来，在工会的积极推动下，在许多企业中都建立了互助储金会。互助储金会对于解决职工生活中的许多困难问题起了很大作用。但是，最近有一部分工会干部不仅放松了对互助储金会的领导，甚至在那里议论这个互助组织有没有存在的必要之类的问题了。
    有一种论调说，互助储金会不能解决大问题，因而没有成立的必要。这种说法是片面的。当然，要想解决职工生活上的重大问题，是要依靠国家或企业行政上投资才能办得到。但是，职工生活中的问题是多方面的，除了住房、婚丧事、生病住医院等重大问题之外，也还有一些一时难以想到的小问题，例如为子女交学费钱不够，回家路费短少，买些日常生活必需品缺点钱等等。这些，似乎都是些“小问题”，可是，如果这些“小问题”都要求行政上包下来解决，那就不对了。因为企业资金有限，如果企业行政按月支付工资之外，还拨出一大笔款项借给职工，那就会影响企业资金的周转，不仅会给企业经营增加困难，甚至要加大企业的产品成本。这对于国家和人民都是不利的。可是，如果有了互助储金会，那就不仅可以解决职工的临时性的种种困难，使其能够安心生产，也可以减少行政工作上的许多困难，还不至于占用国家和企业的资金。
    事实上，广大职工群众是非常拥护成立互助储金会的，有的职工把互助储金会叫做“及时雨”，有的职工把互助储金会叫做自己的“小银行”。由此可见，互助储金会也可以成为工会联系群众的桥梁之一，也能够促进职工的团结和互助，它也是对职工进行共产主义教育最生动最实际的一种方式。
    有人认为，职工群众自己早有自发的互助习惯了，工会何必再去“干涉”它呢？这种看法也是不对的。固然，在旧中国，工人们为了解决自己的经济困难，曾自发地组织过互助组织。解放后，各地也曾发现过职工群众自发地组织“随会”“请会”的事。但是，由于这种互助组织缺乏领导，它是很不稳定的，有时成立，有时解散，而且经常被坏分子操纵利用，发生种种流弊。所以，工会对于职工群众的互助储金会，绝不应该任其自流，而应该积极领导它向正确的方向发展，使它真正能够解决职工自己所能解决的一些困难，从而增强职工的互助和团结。
    有些职工对于互助储金会的认识也有不正确的地方，某些人动不动就要向互助储金会伸手借钱，什么困难也得找互助储金会解决，不能满足他的要求时就牢骚满腹。这当然是不对的。应该认识，互助储金会是职工群众为了解决困难而成立的经济互助组织，但它不是救济组织，更不可能把什么困难都包下来解决。
    互助储金会的基金来源，主要是依靠会员交纳的基金，工会应动员每一个入会的会员按时或超额完成交纳基金的义务。在借款范围和限额上，不应规定得过小过低，在周转基金允许的情况下，只要是职工群众在生活需要上确有困难的，都应该借钱给他；过去，有的互助储金会规定只有享受补助的人才能借互助金，是不对的。会员向互助储金会借的款，应该有借有还，既不能把互助变成补助，也不能长期不还欠款，影响互助基金的周转。至于有的职工生活上发生了重大困难，需款数量较大，短时间又无法偿还者，应由工会从其他方面设法解决。如果向互助储金会借的款数太多，又长久不还，那就必然会把它搞垮。所以，考察一个互助储金会办得好坏的标志应该是看：借款面有多大，借款所起的作用如何，基金周转率有多高；而不应该只看某一个人借到了多少钱。
    有的人认为，互助储金会的账目应该保密，因为借款人不愿意公布自己的名字。这是不妥当的。借款是正大光明的事，为什么怕公布名字呢？目前在互助储金会中普遍存在的问题是，会员群众不了解互助储金会有多大家底，钱借给了哪些人。有的互助储金会因为账目不清，群众把它叫做“糊涂会”。这种糊涂会显然是要不得的。互助储金会是会员大家的事，不是少数人的事。因此，工会应动员大批积极分子参加互助储金会的工作，定期公布互助基金的收入和借款还款情形，宣传互助的收获，批评无故拖欠借款的人的错误行为，帮助会员安排家庭生活，等等。这样，才能把互助储金会真正变成名副其实的群众性的经济互助组织，并且使它能够巩固地得到发展。
    1956年8月，全国总工会曾重新修订了互助储金会的组织通则。在这个通则中改变了过去只有工会会员才能加入互助储金会的规定，非工会会员也可以参加；取消了入会费；降低了每人交纳互助基金的比例，简化了借款手续；扩大了借款范围。这些新的规定，无疑地大大有助于办好互助储金会。希望各地方工会和基层工会，认真总结已有的经验，发动群众，把互助储金会办好。
