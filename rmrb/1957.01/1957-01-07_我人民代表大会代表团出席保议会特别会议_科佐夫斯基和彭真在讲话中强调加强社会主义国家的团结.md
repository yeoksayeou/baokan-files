Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 6th - The delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee were invited to attend the last day of the eighth special session of the Bulgarian National Assembly on January 5th.

The Bulgarian Communist Party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, and others attended the meeting that day. Zhou Zhuan, the Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria, also accompanied the delegation to the meeting.

At about 10 o'clock, all the representatives attending the meeting stood up, warmly applauded, and cheered to welcome the Chinese delegation entering the venue.

Kozovski, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Bulgarian National Assembly, three representatives of the National Assembly, and Peng Zhen, the head of the Chinese delegation, spoke at the meeting.

In his speech, Kozovski first expressed his warm welcome to the delegation and pointed out the Bulgarian people's past and present cordial and brotherly concern for the Chinese people. He said: "Our people sincerely and warmly rejoice in the great achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects of socialist construction, because these achievements are also the achievements of our people." Kozovski then exposed the vicious conspiracy of imperialism to attack the Soviet Union and attempt to undermine the unity between socialist countries. He said: "Although the delegation's visit here is short, it will undoubtedly further strengthen the friendship between our people and further strengthen the unity between socialist countries."

In his speech, Peng Zhen first said that it was a great honor for the delegation to be invited to participate in this meeting and to have the opportunity to speak at the meeting. He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome and cordial reception to the delegation. When talking about the achievements of the Bulgarian people in socialist construction, Peng Zhen said: "Your achievements are our achievements." He said that both China and Bulgaria are socialist countries and members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. We have established a fraternal and close friendship, and our two countries are carrying out close cooperation in politics, economy, culture, and other fields. There is no doubt that in the future, the people of our two countries will continue to develop this friendship and cooperation, and will continue to develop our friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries. All socialist countries, regardless of their size and population, need close unity and friendly cooperation. Only in this way can we victoriously smash and stop the restoration conspiracies and subversive activities of imperialist aggressive groups, stop their aggression, defend world peace, and smoothly develop socialist construction."

Peng Zhen's speech was interrupted by applause and cheers from time to time. At the end of the speech, everyone stood up, and warm applause and shouts of "Long live our friendship" lasted for a long time.

In the afternoon of the same day, the delegation paid a visit to Popov, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Sofia Municipal People's Congress.
