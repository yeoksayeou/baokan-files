Nankai University Physics Department Teachers
Self-Made and Modified Many Instruments and Equipment

    (Our Newspaper) Many teachers in the Physics Department of Nankai University, after a long period of research, have successfully self-made and modified many instruments and equipment in the past four years, thus solving many difficulties in teaching and scientific research and saving a lot of money for the country.
    Under the leadership of Jiang Ancai, the head of the Physics Department, the "spark source" equipment made by graduate students has achieved initial success. It has a great effect on spectral analysis in the steel industry. Wang Jiaping, director of the Electronic Physics Teaching and Research Group, after more than a year of preparing equipment and designing, successfully made two sets of electronic instruments for measuring cosmic rays. The teachers of this teaching and research group also successfully made more than ten sets of experimental instruments such as "electrolytic cell automatic plotter", "microwave standing wave ratio measuring instrument", "electric lens", "magnetic lens", "gold foil electroscope" and "measurement of ? particle ionization ratio". Under the leadership of Professor Shen Shouchun, the Optics Teaching and Research Group used old optical instruments that could be bought outside to modify fifteen or sixteen sets of valuable instruments. Under the leadership of Chen Renlie, the director of the Solid State Physics Teaching and Research Group, designed and manufactured two magnetic field equipment with a magnetic field strength of 18,000 Gauss. It is now using it to measure the energy of cyclotron particle acceleration, which is an important tool for studying nuclear physics. The small equipment for low-temperature liquefaction of nitrogen in this teaching and research group has been completed with the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the temperature has dropped to minus 195°C.
    In the process of self-making or modifying these instruments and equipment, teachers have encountered many difficulties in terms of material supply and manpower. In order to find ways to overcome various difficulties, they often sent people to Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and other places to try to purchase the required materials and entrust processing. Some professors and associate professors also personally participated in welding circuits, blowing glass instruments, etc. In order to quickly test the effect of self-made instruments, some teachers worked in the laboratory overnight. Some experimental assistants and technicians from the instrument factory also made great efforts in these tasks.
    Most of these successfully self-made instruments and equipment are rare or non-existent in China and cannot be bought from abroad. At present, these self-made or modified instruments and equipment have been applied to intermediate physics and specialized physics experiments and scientific research work, solving many difficulties in teaching and scientific research work.

    南开大学物理系教师
    自制和改装了许多仪器设备
    本报讯　南开大学物理系很多教师经过长期钻研，在最近四年中自制和改装成功了许多仪器设备，从而解决了教学和科学研究工作中的许多困难，并为国家节约了大量资金。
    在物理系主任江安才领导下，由研究生作的“火花光源”设备已经获得初步成功，它对钢铁工业中的光谱分析有很大的作用。电子物理教研组汪佳平主任，经过一年多的筹购器材和设计，自制成功了两套测量宇宙射线的电子仪器。这个教研组教师们还自制成功了“电解槽自动描绘仪”、“微波驻波比的测量仪”、“电透镜”、“磁透镜”、“金萡验电器”和“测量?粒子电离比值”等十多套实验仪器。光学教研组在沈寿春教授的领导下，利用外面可以买到的旧光学仪器，改装成十五、六套很有价值的仪器。固体物理教研组在陈仁烈主任的领导下，设计和制成了两个磁场强度为一万八千高斯的磁场设备，现在正利用它测量回旋加速器粒子加速的能量，这是研究原子核物理的重要工具。这个教研组低温液化氮的小型设备在中国科学院的帮助下已经完成，温度降至零下195℃。
    在自制或改装这些仪器设备的过程中，教师们在材料供应和人力等方面曾经遇到许多困难。他们为了想办法克服各种困难，经常派人到北京、上海、沈阳等地，多方设法购买所需的材料和委托加工。一些教授和副教授们并且亲自参加焊线路、吹玻璃仪器等。有的教师为了迅速地试验出自制仪器的效果，曾在实验室里连夜地进行工作。在这些工作中某些实验辅助员和仪器工厂的技工也作了很大的努力。
    自制成功的这些仪器设备，大都是国内少有或没有、而且无法从国外买到的。目前，这些自制或改装成功的仪器设备大都已经应用到中级物理和专门物理实验及科学研究工作中，解决了教学和科学研究工作中的许多困难。　（曾　涤）
