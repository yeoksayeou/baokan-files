Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 3rd: TASS reported from New York on January 2nd that Pakistani Foreign Minister Noon wrote to the President of the Security Council requesting that the Council convene a meeting in the near future to discuss the Kashmir issue.

The letter stated that negotiations between the governments of Pakistan and India had not led to a “satisfactory resolution” of the question of which country Kashmir belonged to. The letter pointed out that the Pakistani government believes that the Security Council should take immediate measures to ensure that the question of whether Kashmir should be incorporated into India or Pakistan can be resolved through a plebiscite conducted under the supervision of the United Nations.

The Indian delegation to the United Nations also circulated a statement, which pointed out that the purpose of the Pakistani Foreign Minister's letter was to conceal Pakistan's possible use of force to annex Kashmir. The Indian delegation said that the reason why the plebiscite in Kashmir has not been held to this day is solely the fault of Pakistan, because it has not withdrawn its troops from Kashmir. The Indian delegation concluded by stating: There is currently an impression that someone is preparing to re-invade Kashmir.

    巴外长要求安理会讨论克什米尔问题
    印度代表团对克什米尔问题发表声明
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社纽约3日讯：巴基斯坦外交部长努恩1月2日写信给安全理事会主席，要求在最近期内召开理事会会议来讨论克什米尔问题。
    信中说，巴基斯坦和印度两国政府之间的谈判并没有使有关克什米尔属于哪国的问题得到“令人满意的解决”。信中指出，巴基斯坦政府认为，安全理事会应当刻不容缓地采取措施，以使克什米尔归并于印度或者巴基斯坦这个问题能够通过在联合国的监督下进行全民投票的办法得到解决。
    印度驻联合国的代表团也散发了一项声明，声明中指出，巴基斯坦外交部长这封信的目的是掩饰巴基斯坦可能采取武力来并吞克什米尔的行动。印度代表团说，克什米尔的全民投票所以到现在还没有举行，只是巴基斯坦的过错，因为它还没有把自己的军队从克什米尔撤出。印度代表团最后声明说：目前使人有这样一种印象，就是有人在准备重新侵略克什米尔。
