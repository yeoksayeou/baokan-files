Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The Hong Kong British authorities' Information Services Department issued a "Report on the Kowloon and Tsuen Wan Riots" on January 1st. At the same time, the Information Services Department also issued a public statement that the Hong Kong British authorities were prepared to consider compensation claims from victims of the Kowloon riots and a public statement explaining the criminal situation in the Kowloon riots.

The "Report on the Kowloon and Tsuen Wan Riots" is divided into five parts: introduction, narrative (Kowloon side), narrative (Tsuen Wan side), summary of casualties and losses, general evaluation and conclusion. It also includes a letter from Hong Kong British Governor Grantham to the British Colonial Secretary at the beginning.

The introduction to the report openly refers to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique as the "Taiwan National Government" and puts it on a par with the government of the People's Republic of China, once again exposing the British government's attempt to create the so-called "two Chinas" plot.

The report deliberately divides the Kowloon riot, which was planned and organized by Kuomintang secret agents, into two seemingly unrelated events in the Tsuen Wan area and other areas of Kowloon, and attempts to deny the premeditated nature of the Kowloon riot. The report said, "There is no evidence sufficient to say that there was prior planning; on the contrary, all indications point out that the riot was self-initiated." The report tried its best to exonerate Kuomintang secret agents, saying, "After extensive investigation, no plan to instigate riots was discovered before the Li Zhengwu incident mentioned below, nor was there any evidence of collusion with the outside world," and arbitrarily affirmed, "The conclusion reached is that the Kowloon riot was incited by lawless elements, and it was a criminal act rather than a political or other actor."

Nevertheless, many of the facts listed in the report still show that the Kowloon riot was planned and organized by Kuomintang secret agents. The report pointed out that the Li Zhengwu Village Resettlement Area incident on October 10, 1956 was caused by the "Triads and lawless elements" taking advantage of the opportunity when a low-level employee of the Hong Kong authorities tore down the Kuomintang flag. Initially, "party members acted individually, but at 10 p.m., it was proved that organized party members, led by people holding large Kuomintang flags, started from the Shek Kip Mei Resettlement Area building"; and it admitted that the "majority of residents who were considered Kuomintang members" initially participated in the resettlement area riot, and were later led by "14K party and On Lok Triad members carrying Kuomintang flags" and divided into "groups holding Kuomintang flags" to carry out organized "mobile attacks". The 14K party was a "semi-official political underground organization" founded during the "Kuomintang regime," and its members were mostly Kuomintang army personnel and junior officials.

Regarding the riots in Tsuen Wan, the report stated that before October 10, the so-called "right-wing workers" in the Tsuen Wan area had held many meetings, and Kuomintang members and Triad members also participated in the daily meetings. On the evening of the 10th and noon on the 11th, "masses who were not workers but included Kuomintang members and Triad members held a special meeting at Huaxing School" to organize and deploy the riots, and stipulated that "activists in the crowd should tie a handkerchief around their left arm or put a Kuomintang paper flag in the chest pocket of their coat for identification. In addition, a flag communication system was established between the factory and Huaxing School." It pointed out that the main characteristic of the Tsuen Wan riot was that "they were led by people holding large Kuomintang flags, echoed each other with whistle sounds, and used white wristbands for identification"; forced the factory principals to hang Kuomintang flags and pay protection fees; "Houses inhabited by those who sympathized with the Communist Party, whether they were trade unions, houses, or shops, were subjected to consistent destructive attacks and were treated cruelly and humiliatingly." This proves that the Tsuen Wan riot was also planned and organized by Kuomintang secret agents.

In order to cover up the truth, the report attributed the root cause of the riot to the "refugees from the mainland" and the existence of Triads and other gang organizations that have been active in Hong Kong and Kowloon for a long time; and said that these gang organizations had "gradually increased their power" due to the "sharp increase in the number of refugees coming to Hong Kong." However, when narrating the course of events, the report could not but admit that the "refugees" and gang organizations that participated in the riot were in fact used by Kuomintang secret agents.

The report also defended the Hong Kong British authorities' failure to prevent the riot in advance and their failure to quickly stop the spread of the riot after it occurred. But the actual situation it showed was that the riot had spread to most of the Kowloon area on the same day it occurred, and many people had been injured or killed. However, the Hong Kong British authorities did not believe until 10:00 a.m. on the 11th that "the riot had gone beyond the stage of mass frenzy caused by the National Day (referring to the October 10th Xinhai Revolution Memorial)," and waited until about 4:00 p.m. on the 11th before the "three battalions of troops ordered to enter Kowloon to carry out guard duties" "began to arrive." The report also showed that when the Tsuen Wan riot occurred, the police officers in the area, because they "could not control the situation" and feared that their weapons would be robbed by the rioters or that they would "attack the police station and succeed," abandoned their posts around 7:15 p.m. under the pretext of "being ordered to retreat and defend the police station," allowing the rioters to carry out brutal atrocities against the peaceful residents of the Tsuen Wan area. By the time the army security forces arrived in the area, the peaceful residents of Tsuen Wan had already suffered heavy casualties and losses.

The report mentioned the situation of the arrested criminals, saying that "among the more than 6,000 people arrested during and after the riots, about 3,000 were released after questioning, and 1,455 were charged with violating the curfew, of which 1,241 were found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for seven days to two months, and 214 were fined, bailed, or released. As of November 27, the remaining 737 people detained were charged with more serious crimes in Kowloon" and "will be tried in the High Court, because the court has the right to impose heavier penalties." However, up to now, throughout the entire trial process, the Hong Kong British authorities have disregarded obvious facts and have always been unwilling to reveal the criminal facts of the Kuomintang secret agents who planned and organized the riots, and to impose the punishment they deserve.

The report mentioned the casualties and losses caused by the riots, saying that "the total number of injured recorded in the hospital was 443, of which 59 were killed due to injuries, and the number of injured who were not hospitalized was probably not small." The report estimates that the losses caused by arson, destruction, and looting in the riots amounted to HK$4.77 million. These figures for deaths, injuries, and losses are obviously smaller than those revealed by Hong Kong newspapers and news agencies in the past.

The report did not make a responsible guarantee for effectively protecting the lives and property of Chinese residents in the future, but instead stated that "the danger of events similar to those that broke out in October still exists and must be guarded against." The report also did not mention taking comfort, relief, and other follow-up measures for the victims of the riots. To date, the Hong Kong British authorities have only stated in their Information Services Department public statement that compensation claims from victims will be considered. How the Hong Kong British authorities will consider this has not been seen yet.

    企图掩盖真相推卸责任
    香港英当局发表“九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”
    新华社22日讯　香港英国当局新闻处1月1日发表了一项“九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”。与此同时，该新闻处又发表了一项香港英国当局准备考虑九龙暴乱事件中受害者赔偿要求的公报和关于说明九龙暴乱中犯罪情况的公报。
    “九龙及荃湾暴动报告书”分引言、叙述（九龙方面）、叙述（荃湾方面）、伤亡及损失摘要、概评及结论五个部分，篇首并附有香港英国总督葛量洪致英国殖民部大臣函一件。
    报告书的引言中公然称台湾蒋介石集团为“台湾国民政府”，并且把它同中华人民共和国政府相提并论，又一次暴露了英国政府企图制造所谓“两个中国”的阴谋。
    报告书把国民党特务分子一手策动和组织的九龙暴乱事件，故意分成荃湾地区和九龙其他地区两个似无关联的事件加以叙述，并且企图否认九龙暴乱事件的预谋性质。报告书说，“并无任何证供，足以谓之为有事先预谋，所有表示，反指出暴动乃本身发起”。报告书极力为国民党特务分子开脱罪责，说“经广泛调查后，仍未发觉在下开论及之李郑屋事件发生前，有任何策动暴乱之计划，亦未有迹象证明与外界有共谋行动”，并武断地肯定，“其所得结论乃为九龙之暴动系不法之徒所煽动，乃属犯罪行为，而非政治及其他作用者”。
    虽然如此，报告书中所列举的许多事实仍然表明，九龙暴乱是国民党特务分子所策划和组织的。报告书指出，1956年10月10日李郑屋村徙置区事件系“三合会及不法之徒”利用香港当局一下级职员撕去国民党旗帜而肇事的机会引起的，初时“党徒仅个别行动，惟至下午十时，证明有组织之党徒，由持有大面国民党旗之人领导，在石硖尾徙置区大楼出发”；而且承认，开始参加徙置区暴乱的“大部包括徙置之居民被认为系国民党党员者”，后由“携带国民党旗之14K党和安乐三合会会员率领”，分成“持有国民党旗之各组”，进行有组织的“流动性袭击”。而14K党则是“国民党政权时期”创立的“半官式政治性之地下组织，其会员多系国民党陆军人员及低级官吏”。
    关于荃湾方面的暴乱，报告书表示，在10月10日之前，荃湾地区的所谓“右翼工人”已集会多次，而且国民党党员和三合会会员也参与连日的集会。10日晚上及11日中午“并非工人但包括国民党党员及三合会会员群众，在华兴学校召开特别会议”，组织与部署暴乱，并规定“人群内活动分子，用手帕环扎左臂，或将国民党纸旗放在外衣胸袋，以资识别。此外更定下工厂与华兴学校间旗号统系。”它指出，荃湾暴乱之主要特点是，“彼等由持大面国民党旗之人领导用哨笛音响相呼应，并用白色腕带以资识别”；强迫工厂之主事人悬挂国民党旗和交纳保护费；“凡同情共产党者居住之屋宇，不论是否工会抑房屋或店户，均受到一致破坏性之攻击，兼受到残忍及羞辱之待遇”等。这证明荃湾暴乱同样是国民党特务分子所策划和组织的。
    为了掩盖真象，报告书把这次暴乱的根源说成是“由大陆而来的难民”和港九地区长期活动的三合会等帮会组织存在的事实；并说这些帮会组织由于“难民来港人数激增”，“逐渐增加了势力”。但是，报告书在叙述事件发生经过时，却不能不承认参加暴乱的“难民”和帮会组织，事实上是为国民党特务分子所利用的。
    报告书还为香港英国当局在暴乱发生前未能预先防止，在暴乱发生后又未能迅速制止暴乱的扩大进行了辩解。但它同时表明的实际情况却是，事件发生的当天暴乱即已扩展到大半个九龙地区，并且已有很多人伤亡。但是香港英国当局直到11日上午十时才认为“暴动已超越因国庆日（按指十月十日辛亥革命纪念）庆祝而致之群众疯狂阶段”，又等到11日下午四时左右，“奉命入九龙执行警戒工作的三营军队”才“开始到达”。报告书又表明，荃湾地区暴乱发生时，该区警员由于“无法控制局面”，而且害怕他们的武器为暴徒所劫夺或“攻击警署而得手”，竟于下午七时十五分左右在“受命撤退，防卫警署”的借口下逃弃职守，听任暴徒向荃湾地区的和平居民进行了残酷的暴行。等到后来陆军保安部队开抵该区时，荃湾的和平居民已经遭受了重大的伤亡和损失。
    报告书提到已拘捕的罪犯情况时说，“在暴乱事件中和以后被捕的六千多人中，约有三千人经询问后已获释放，有一千四百五十五人被控违反戒严令，其中有一千二百四十一人被判有罪入狱七日至两个月，有二百一十四人被判罚款或签保、或释放。至11月27日为止，其余被禁的七百三十七人被控以在九龙犯更严重之罪”，“将在高级法庭审讯，因该法庭有权处以较重之刑罚”。但是迄今为止，香港英国当局在整个审讯过程中，不顾明显的事实，始终不愿揭露国民党特务分子一手策动和组织此次暴乱的犯罪事实，并处他们以应得之罪刑。
    报告书提到暴乱事件中造成的伤亡和损失时说，“送院记录的受伤人数共四百四十三名，其中五十九名因伤致命，受伤而未有入院的数字大概不小”。报告书估计在暴乱中被纵火、破坏和劫掠所造成的损失共达港币四百七十七万元。这些死伤和损失数字显然比过去香港报刊、通讯社所揭露的数字为小。
    报告书对今后切实保障中国居民生命财产安全一事，并未作出负责的保证，反而表示，“类似十月所爆发之事件，其危险仍常存在，而须加紧戒备”。该报告书也未提到对这次暴乱事件中的受害者采取抚恤、救济以及其他善后措施。迄今为止，香港英国当局仅限于在其新闻处公报中表示对于受害者的赔偿要求将加以考虑。究竟香港英国当局如何考虑的，至今还没有见到下文。
