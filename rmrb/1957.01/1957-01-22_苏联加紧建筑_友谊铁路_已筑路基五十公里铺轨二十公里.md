Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: According to TASS reports: The railway from the Soviet station of Akhtouka to the Xinjiang border has already laid twenty kilometers of heavy-duty steel rails.

The Soviet railway builders, having overfulfilled last year's work tasks, are intensifying the construction of this "Friendship Railway," which will shorten the route between the Soviet Union and China, braving the severe cold of minus thirty-five degrees Celsius and blizzards. The two thousand road builders, equipped with highly efficient machinery, have decided to lay fifty kilometers of steel rails on the main line in the first quarter of this year.

The roadbed of this railway has already been built for fifty kilometers. Recently, two more mechanized road construction teams were transferred to the middle section of the line in the Ucharal-Koktuma area, where they have begun constructing the roadbed for the 125 to 225 kilometer section. Bridge builders have been transferred from Odessa to this line, where they have established their main base at Lepsa station. A group of bridge workers has already begun erecting the first 270-meter-long reinforced concrete bridge on the Kenzheke River.

Exploration for building materials and water sources is continuing. Construction of some new industrial supply bases has begun. Housing for construction workers and railway employees is also under construction.

    苏联加紧建筑“友谊铁路”
    已筑路基五十公里铺轨二十公里
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联阿克斗卡站到新疆边境的铁路，已经铺设了二十公里的重型钢轨。
    超额完成了去年工作任务的苏联铁路建设者们，正在冒着零下三十五度的严寒和暴风雪，加紧建设这条缩短苏联到中国的路程的“友谊铁路”。配备着效能很高的机械设备的两千名筑路工人们，决定在今年第一季度内在干线上铺设五十公里的钢轨。
    这条铁路的路基已经筑成了五十公里。最近，又有两支机械化筑路队调到乌奇阿腊拉——科克图玛地区线路的中段去，他们已经开始建筑一百二十五到二百二十五公里地段的路基。桥梁建筑师已经从敖德萨调到这个线路上来，他们在列普萨站建立了自己的主要基地，有一批建桥工人已经在坚捷克河畔开始架设这条铁路的第一座二百七十公尺长的钢筋混凝土大桥。
    探查建筑材料和水源的工作正在继续进行。一些新的工业供应基地的建设工程已经开始进行。建筑工人和铁路员工的住宅也在兴建中。
