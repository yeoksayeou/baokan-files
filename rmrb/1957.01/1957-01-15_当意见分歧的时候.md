When Opinions Differ
By our correspondents Shang Kai and Gu Ye

    In August 1956, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory completed its first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. At this time, the factory's Party committee believed it was necessary to put forward demands for increased production and thrift, in order to encourage all factory workers to continue to move forward.

    At the Party committee meeting, all members were in favor of putting forward the demand for increased production and thrift. However, when discussing the details of thrift, the opinions of the Party committee members diverged, leading to a fierce debate. Meng Zhengong, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, proposed that in the four months until the end of the year, a total of 150,000 yuan could be reduced from planned costs through collecting scrap materials and scrap steel filings for steelmaking, utilizing waste materials and substitutes, reducing material consumption, increasing labor productivity, and saving workshop expenses. Liu Qinye, a Party committee member and deputy factory director for production, believed that collecting, utilizing, and conserving materials was necessary, but that doing so would increase complicated processing procedures, and in some cases even increase costs. For example, the factory did not manufacture seamless steel pipes of the type needed for the 300-meter drilling rig vertical shaft, and the steel pipes in stock were all thicker than needed. If these thick steel pipes were used to replace thin steel pipes, they would have to be drawn thinner. Furthermore, collecting scrap materials and scrap steel filings for steelmaking would also take up a lot of manpower and equipment. It would be good enough to ensure that costs didn't increase; there was no guarantee of reducing costs beyond the plan. To convince Liu Qinye, Meng Zhengong gave him a specific accounting: the cost-increasing factors had already been taken into account. For example, using 200 tons of scrap steel filings to make steel, worth 14,000 yuan, had already deducted the cost of manpower and equipment. In addition, collecting 300 tons of scrap material throughout the factory was worth 27,000 yuan, and the forging and riveting workshop saved and utilized 125 tons of waste material, worth 25,000 yuan... Meng Zhengong listed a series of figures.

    At this time, most of the committee members expressed their support for Meng Zhengong's proposals, believing that these measures were correct. Only Liu Qinye remained skeptical. He said, "Even with these calculations, adding up the numbers only amounts to a little over 90,000 yuan, far from 150,000 yuan. Moreover, many of these numbers are unreliable!"

    Meng Zhengong said, "These figures are not just something I made up arbitrarily. They were calculated in detail by the various functional departments, and they all have verifiable bases."

    Liu Qinye said, "Have you consulted with the workshop cadres and workers? You need to know that the calculations of the departments may not work in practice; the departments cannot replace the workshops. For example, requiring the forging and riveting workshop to save and utilize 125 tons of steel scrap before the end of the year, I think this is problematic. Because saving this part of the steel will not only increase trouble and waste time, the workshop's output will also be affected. If these problems are not solved, can the workshop cadres accept it? Can the workers accept it? Any measure should not be proposed in a general and vague way." Liu Qinye finally stated that proposing to reduce costs beyond the plan by 100,000 yuan would be the most he could agree to.

    The meeting came to a standstill here.

    At this time, most of the committee members felt from Liu Qinye's speech that he had a kind of negative sentiment that overemphasized objective difficulties. For example, Liu Qinye should not have said dogmatically that workshop cadres and workers would not accept it, without having gone to the workshop for investigation. However, because he understood the actual production situation better than anyone else, the questions he raised were not entirely unreasonable. For example, he pointed out that Meng Zhengong had not consulted with the workshop cadres and workers, and affirmed the figures for reducing costs based on the calculations of the various functional departments, which made the problem seem too simple. Would this encounter difficulties in specific implementation? What measures should be taken to solve the possible difficulties? Indeed, most of the committee members, including Meng Zhengong, had not considered these issues. Obviously, the reason for the stalemate was not that either side had no basis, but that the basis was not sufficient; this was the crux of the problem.

    The members of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory Party committee remembered very clearly how much harm had been caused in the past because everyone's opinions on work had not been consistent for a long time! That was in the late spring of 1954, when the Party committee and the administration had a difference of opinion on what work should be the focus of the enterprise at that time. The Party committee advocated focusing on implementing the "one-chief system," the administration insisted on focusing on the operational plan, the trade union wanted to implement collective contracts, and the Communist Youth League proposed organizing technological innovations. Everyone raised their own banner, forming many central tasks, which caused production to fall into chaos for two months. Later, after in-depth investigation, it was discovered that the problem was caused by subjectivism, with committee members one-sidedly emphasizing the importance of their own system's work, while neglecting to study and implement the instructions from higher authorities from the actual situation of the entire factory.

    Since then, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory Party committee began to pay attention to using the method of in-depth practical investigation and research to resolve differences of opinion between each other. Many subsequent facts proved that investigation and research is indeed a good way to resolve differences of opinion. Because the situation of a factory is very complex, it can be said to have thousands of threads and countless changes, and people's understanding of objective things has certain limitations, making it impossible to understand things very clearly all at once. Therefore, the opinions of the Party committee members often only reflect one aspect of the problem, and they try to persuade others based on the one aspect they see. This naturally leads to differences of opinion and endless debate. At this time, if one goes deeper, and supplements everyone's insufficient understanding of the problem through investigation and research of the actual situation, then the opinions will quickly reach a consensus.

    Since the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory Party committee had a deeper understanding of this issue, when everyone was arguing endlessly about the specific figures for reducing costs beyond the plan, they decided to temporarily stop the debate and conduct further investigation and research.

    After the meeting, everyone went down to the workshops to study with cadres and workers, where materials could be saved, where costs could be reduced, what measures could be taken, what difficulties might be encountered, and how to solve these difficulties, and so on. For example, they went deep into the forging and riveting workshop and learned that to complete the plan to save 125 tons of steel, a series of new problems caused by this also needed to be solved. Because the plan to save 125 tons of steel mainly relied on fully utilizing the leftover material after cutting large parts, this part of the scrap steel was originally recovered as waste. If workers were asked to use it to forge parts, as Liu Qinye said, it would not only take too much time and squeeze out the time for making large products, but also not get much wages, so few people were willing to take care of these scraps. However, this was not an insurmountable difficulty. After the Party and administrative leaders studied together with the workshop cadres and workers, they came up with many specific methods, such as stipulating that workers would receive bonuses for saving materials, appropriately increasing working hours for using scrap to forge parts, and strengthening the work of material distribution, etc. In this way, not only would it not affect the workshop's output, but the workers could also increase their income, which everyone was happy to accept.

    After such in-depth investigation and research and repeated calculations, it was proved that it was entirely possible to reduce costs beyond the plan by 150,000 yuan. This not only gave the leading cadres a clear understanding, and gave the workers specific goals to strive for, but also put the plan to reduce costs on a reliable basis by taking various specific measures. At the Party committee meeting, everyone unanimously agreed with the slogan "Reduce Costs Beyond the Plan by 150,000 Yuan."

    The consensus of the factory leaders promoted a new upsurge in the campaign to increase production and conserve resources. The Party, administration, and trade union all launched activities separately, actively organizing the masses to strive to achieve new conservation goals. By the end of last year, the slogan "Reduce Costs Beyond the Plan by 150,000 Yuan" had been realized, and the factory had reduced costs beyond the plan by a total of 158,076 yuan.

    当意见分歧的时候
    本报记者　商恺　顾页
    太原矿山机器厂在1956年8月，就提前完成了第一个五年计划的任务。这时候，工厂党委会认为有必要提出增产节约的要求，来鼓舞全厂职工继续前进。
    在党委会议上，全体委员对提出增产节约这件事都不反对。但是，当研究节约内容的时候，党委委员之间的意见有了分歧，并进行了一场激烈的争论。党委副书记孟震功同志提出：在到年底的四个月里，从收集废料和废钢铁屑炼钢、利用碎料和代用品、降低材料消耗、提高劳动生产率、节约车间费用等方面，共可超计划降低成本十五万元。党委委员、生产副厂长刘勤学同志认为收集、利用和节约材料是必要的，但是这样做，要增加繁杂的加工手续，有的甚至要增加成本。例如厂里没有制造三百公尺钻探机立轴那种型号的无缝钢管，库存的钢管都比需要的粗，如果拿这些粗钢管来代替细钢管，就得把它拉细。又如，收集废料、废钢铁屑炼钢，也得占用许多人力和设备的。这样能保证不提高成本就很好了，要超计划降低成本是没有把握的。孟震功为要说服刘勤学，便具体算账给他听：增加成本的因素，我们已经考虑到了，比如利用废钢铁屑炼钢二百吨值一万四千元，就已经扣除了占用人力和设备的费用，另外在全厂收集废料三百吨值两万七千元，锻铆车间节约和利用碎料一百二十五吨值二万五千元……孟震功列举了一连串的数目字。
    这时候，大多数的委员都表示支持孟震功提出的意见，认为采取这些措施是正确的。唯有刘勤学仍然表示怀疑。他说：“即使这样计算，把数字加起来也不过九万多元，离十五万还很远，何况里边还有许多数字是不可靠的呢！”
    孟震功说：“这些数目字也不是我随意瞎说的。这是经过各职能科室详细计算出来的，他们都有根据可查。”
    刘勤学说：“你同车间干部和工人商量过了吗？要知道科室的计算放到实际里边不一定行得通，科室不能代替车间。比如，要求锻铆车间到年底以前节约和利用碎料一百二十五吨钢，我看这一条就有问题。因为要节约这一部分钢，既增加麻烦，又浪费时间，车间产量还要受影响，试问这些问题不解决，车间干部能接受吗？工人能接受吗？提出任何一个措施、都不应当笼笼统统的空喊。”刘勤学最后表示：提出超计划降低成本十万元也就顶破天了。
    会议开到这里就僵住了。
    这时候，大多数委员们从刘勤学的发言里，都感觉到他有一种过分强调客观困难的消极情绪。比如，刘勤学本来没有去车间作过调查，就不应当武断地说车间干部和工人都不能接受。但是由于他对实际生产情况了解得比谁都多，所以他提出的问题，也并非全无道理。比如，他提出的孟震功没有同车间干部和工人商量，就依照各职能科室的计算肯定了降低成本的数字，把问题未免也看得太简单了。这在具体执行的时候会不会遇到困难呢？采取什么措施解决可能遇到的困难呢？的确，大多数委员，连孟震功在内，都没有考虑到这些问题。显然，争执不下的原因，不是双方都没有根据，而是根据都不充分，这就是问题的症结所在。
    太原矿山机器厂党委会的委员们记得很清楚：过去有一个时期，由于大家对工作的意见长期未取得一致，曾经造成了多么大的恶果啊！那是在1954年春末，党委和行政之间对于当时企业中以什么工作为中心的问题，意见发生了分歧。党委主张以推行一长制为主，行政坚持以作业计划为主，工会要推行集体合同，青年团提出组织技术革新。大家各树一帜，形成了很多中心工作，使生产陷于混乱状态达两月之久。后来经过深入调查，才发现原来是主观主义在打架，委员们都片面地强调自己系统的工作重要性，而忽视了从全厂实际情况出发去研究和执行上级指示。
    从那以后，太原矿山机器厂党委会开始注意了用深入实际调查研究的方法，去解决彼此之间的意见分歧。后来的许多事实证明，调查研究确实是解决意见分歧的好办法。因为，一个厂的情况是很复杂的，可以说是千头万绪、千变万化，而人们对客观事物的认识，又有着一定的局限性，不可能一下子就认识得很清楚。所以，党委委员的意见往往是各自只反映了问题的一个方面，并用自己看到的一个方面作根据说服别人，这样自然就会发生意见分歧，而且争论不休。这时候，如果深入下去，从对实际情况的调查研究中，去弥补大家对问题认识的不足，意见就会很快的求得统一。
    太原矿山机器厂党委会既然对这个问题有着较深的体会，因此当大家对超计划降低成本的具体数字争论不休的时候，便决定暂且停止争论，下去再作调查研究。
    会后，大家都下到车间，和干部、工人共同研究，在什么地方可以节约材料，在什么地方可以降低成本，采取些什么措施，可能会遇到什么困难，怎样解决这些困难等等。比如，他们深入到锻铆车间，就了解到要完成节约一百二十五吨钢材的计划，还需要解决由此而引起的一系列的新问题。因为节约一百二十五吨钢的计划，主要是依靠充分利用剪裁大部件以后所剩的料头来完成，这一部分零碎钢材原来都是当作废料回收的，如果让工人们把它利用起来，锻制成零件，正像刘勤学所说的，不仅费时太多，挤掉了作大件产品的时间，而且还得不到多少工资，所以很少有人愿意去侍弄这些料头。但是，这并不是不可克服的困难。经过党和行政领导干部同车间干部、工人共同研究以后，想出了许多具体办法，如规定工人节约有成绩的发节约奖金，利用料头锻制零件，可以适当地增加工时，加强配料工作等等。这样作，不但不会影响车间产量，工人还能增加收入，大家都乐于接受。
    经过这样深入地调查研究和反复地计算以后，证明超计划降低成本十五万元是完全可能的。这不仅使领导干部心中有了数，工人有了具体的奋斗目标，而且由于采取了种种具体措施，使降低成本的计划放在了可靠的基础上。在党委会上，大家一致同意了“超计划降低成本十五万元”的口号。
    厂领导干部的思想一致，促进了增产节约运动的新高涨。党、行政、工会都分头展开活动，积极地组织群众为实现新的节约目标而奋斗。到去年年底为止，“超计划降低成本十五万元”的口号已经实现，全厂共超计划降低成本十五万八千零七十六元。
