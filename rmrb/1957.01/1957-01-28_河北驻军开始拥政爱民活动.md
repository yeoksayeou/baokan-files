    Troops Stationed in Hebei Begin Activities to Support the Government and Cherish the People

    (Our Dispatch) The activities of troops stationed in Hebei to support the government and cherish the people are unfolding in various aspects.

    Recently, the troops stationed in Hebei have generally invited leading Party and government organs, mass organizations, and leading administrative departments of industry and commerce in the stationed areas to hold discussions, solicit opinions, and conduct visits and consultations in streets and agricultural production cooperatives. Soldiers are helping local people with pre-Spring Festival cleaning. The troops' cultural troupes and film projection teams are holding joint performances for the local people everywhere. Inside the troops, a spirit of self-criticism is also being widely used to conduct serious inspections on compliance with policies and laws, respect for government workers, compliance with public order and traffic rules, and protection of the interests of the masses in the past year.

    Over the past year, the troops stationed in Hebei have maintained and fully carried forward the glorious tradition of the people's army in supporting the government and cherishing the people through their actual actions. Last year, the officers and soldiers of the Hebei Military Region purchased more national economic construction bonds, exceeding the plan by 14.5%. In supporting the agricultural cooperativization movement, various troops actively donated money to tractor stations. Their care and assistance to the broad masses is even more meticulous. They not only helped the masses with production during the busy farming season, but also helped the masses build schools and train medical and health personnel. For example, the medical personnel of a certain regiment's first battalion provided 231 medical consultations to the masses from January to May, and also assisted the county health section in training 212 health care personnel for the agricultural production cooperatives in the stationed area.

    Last autumn, many areas in Hebei Province suffered floods. The troops stationed in Hebei showed their excellent qualities of loving the people even more, mobilizing all water and air transportation tools to invest in rescue and supply work in the disaster areas. The water level of Baiyangdian rose sharply, and the thousands of miles of dikes protecting Tianjin were in urgent need. The People's Liberation Army troops rushed to the scene overnight, and all officers and soldiers used their bodies as dikes to overcome storms of level five or above. Dong Shirong, a soldier from a certain unit who rushed to plug the breach in Tangzhuang, Xianxian County, carried out an old man in his seventies from a house surrounded by water that was about to collapse. At the same time, the troops launched a movement to save and donate to disaster relief.

    However, the troops stationed in Hebei Province were not satisfied with this. They reviewed what shortcomings they still had in supporting the government and cherishing the people in the past, so as to further strengthen the unity between the army and the local areas and the masses.

    河北驻军开始拥政爱民活动
    本报讯　河北驻军的拥政爱民活动正从多方面展开。
    近来，河北驻军普遍地邀请了驻地党、政领导机关、群众团体以及工、商行政领导部门举行座谈，征求意见，到街道、农业生产合作社中进行访问和征询意见；士兵们帮助驻地群众进行春节前的清洁扫除；部队的文工团、电影队，到处为当地群众举行联欢公演；部队内部也普遍以自我批评的精神对过去一年来在遵守政策法令、尊重政府工作人员、遵守公共秩序、交通规则、维护群众利益等方面进行认真的检查。
    一年来，河北驻军在他们的实际行动中，保持并充分发扬了人民军队拥政爱民的光荣传统。去年，河北军区的全体指战员购买国家经济建设公债超过了计划的14.5％；在支持农业合作化运动中，各个部队都踊跃给拖拉机站捐款。他们对广大群众的关怀和帮助，更是无微不至，不仅在农忙季节帮助群众生产，而且帮助群众建设学校，训练医药卫生人材。如某部一团的卫生人员除在1至5月为群众出诊二百三十一次以外，还协助县卫生科给驻地农业生产合作社训练了二百一十二名卫生保健人员。
    去年秋天，河北省许多地区发生水灾，河北驻军更表现了热爱人民的优良品质，动员了所有的水上和空中的交通运输工具投入了对灾区的抢救和供应工作。白洋淀的水位猛涨，保卫天津的千里堤告急，解放军部队连夜赶去，全体指战员们以身代埝，战胜了五级以上的风暴。抢堵献县唐庄决口的某部战士董士荣，在被水包围即将倒坍的房屋中，背出了七十来岁的老大爷。同时，部队又展开了节约捐献救灾运动。
    但是河北省驻军并未因此而满足，他们检查了过去在拥政爱民方面还有哪些不足的地方，以便进一步加强军队与地方和群众的团结。
