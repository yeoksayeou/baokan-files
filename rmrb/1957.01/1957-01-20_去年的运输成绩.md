Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch:

    Last year, the national shipping departments completed a massive transportation task. The freight turnover volume completed by the steamers and barges of the inland river shipping enterprises directly under the Ministry of Communications and the local inland river shipping enterprises of various provinces increased by 3.7 times compared with 1952.

    Last year, the transportation enterprises under the Ministry of Communications along the Yangtze River, Heilongjiang River, Pearl River, South China coastal areas, and coastal areas north of the Yangtze River estuary all exceeded their freight volume targets. The main materials transported along the entire Yangtze River and coastal areas included millions of tons of coal, grain, and over a million tons of metals, ore, steel, and manufactured products. The passenger turnover volume on inland rivers and coastal areas also exceeded the annual plan.

    In Yangtze River shipping, the one-train towing method, formerly known as the "water train," has been gradually replaced by the new top-pushing transportation method, greatly improving the utilization rate of tugboat horsepower.

    All the sailors of the Guangzhou and Shanghai Maritime Bureaus created more than 700 advanced voyages last year, equivalent to transporting more than 50,000 tons of additional cargo for the country, which not only accelerated the transportation speed but also ensured safety and saved fuel.

    More than 2,900 transportation cooperatives have been organized for wooden sailboats with a total load of more than 3 million tons, which operate on inland rivers in various provinces and undertake 85% of the national local inland river transportation volume.

    去年的运输成绩
    据新华社18日讯　全国航运部门去年完成了庞大的运输任务。交通部直属内河航运企业和各省地方内河航运企业的轮船和驳船，在这一年内所完成的货物运输周转量，比1952年增加了三点七倍。
    去年交通部所属长江、黑龙江、珠江、华南沿海和长江口以北沿海的运输企业，都超额完成了货物运输量指标。通过长江全线和沿海运输的主要物资，有几百万吨煤炭、粮食和上百万吨金属、矿砂、钢铁和制品。内河和沿海的旅客运输周转量也都超额完成了全年计划。
    在长江航运方面，过去人们称为“水上列车”的一列式拖带运输法，已经由新的顶推运输法逐步代替，大大提高了拖轮马力的利用率。
    广州区和上海区两个海运局的全体海员，去年创造了七百多个先进航次，等于为国家多运了五万多吨货物，不但加快了运输速度，也保证了安全和节约了燃料。
    各省内河航行的共载重三百多万吨的木帆船，已经组织了两千九百多个运输合作社，承担了全国地方内河运输85％的运量。
