    A Junior High School Graduate Who Loves the Pig Raising Business
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Lizhong
    Anyone who has visited the Yucheng County Farm in Henan Province is amazed to see more than a hundred pigs raised in a row of neat pigsties. When the bell rings, all the pigs in the sty come out to eat; when the whistle blows, the pigs all come out of the sty to exercise; this place is like a school for pigs. The young pig farmer Li Youxuan affectionately numbered all the large sows he raised here, and sometimes he also went out to herd pigs, even picking out a big boar to ride for a few steps. It was he, this junior high school graduate who loves the pig raising business, who recently solemnly requested a responsible comrade from the Provincial Department of Agriculture: to raise pigs on this farm for another thirty years, and not to transfer his work.

    In the autumn of 1955, when Li Youxuan had just walked out of the junior high school gate and came to the farm as a pig farmer, the primary school students near the farm often jokingly called him "Pig Principal" and "Pig Herder," and people at home often grumbled that he had no future by feeding pigs after graduating from junior high school. At that time, under this incorrect ridicule that despised physical labor, he really wanted to throw away the pig feed carrier and quit. Later, he heard that in a provincial model worker conference, their farm was rated as a special-class model farm in the province, and the employees in the farm were respected in all aspects. He began to feel the glory of labor, and he also thought of the relationship between pigs and people's lives: he thought of the needs of urban and rural people, and the country using pork to exchange for a large number of tractors from abroad to gallop in the fields, etc. He felt that pig raising was not a so-called lowly profession, and he realized that pig raising was an important contribution to building socialism, and from then on, he made a vow to make pig raising a lifelong career. Later, when the children called him "Pig Principal" again, he no longer detoured to avoid them, but straightened his chest and raised his head.

    When Li Youxuan first raised pigs, he knew nothing about this work. When feeding the pigs, twenty or so pigs ran to the trough at the same time, big pigs squeezed small pigs, strong pigs squeezed weak pigs; the weaker ones could not grab food, and became thinner and thinner. Li Youxuan watched anxiously, but there was nothing he could do. Later, he learned from foreign experience and adopted the method of feeding in separate pens according to size, which eliminated this chaotic situation. Later, the pigs developed more and more. Li Youxuan went from feeding twenty or so pigs to forty or fifty pigs in less than half a year. There were big and small, and they had to be fed in six or seven pens. He was busy all day just feeding the pigs, and he had to clean the pigsties, not to mention feeding more. So he tried to reduce unnecessary labor as much as possible. He remembered that when farmers feed pigs, they always make a clucking sound, and when the pigs hear it, they run home; he also remembered the principle of Pavlov's conditioned reflex that he had learned in school, and he wanted to develop the habit of pigs eating food when the bell rang. So when he was feeding the pigs once, he took a bell and shook it hard, and as a result, the pigs all abandoned their food and ran away. He was not discouraged by this failure. The second time he fed the pigs, he shook the bell gently. Although there was no significant effect, the pigs did not run away. Later, he rang the bell every time he fed the pigs, and gradually this became a habit. When the pigs heard the bell, they ran to the pig feed trough.

    After this method was successful, he then adopted two methods, ringing the bell and blowing the whistle, to train the five or six pens of pigs he fed to eat in shifts: when the bell rang, the pigs in the first and second pens came out to eat, and the pigs in the third and fourth pens did not move. When the first shift finished eating, he blew a whistle, and the pigs in the third and fourth pens came out to eat, and the pigs in the first and second pens returned to the sty. In addition, on the road from the pigsty to the feed trough, he dug a small puddle, and sprinkled some bean cake on the small open space above the pit every time he fed the pigs. When the pigs came out to eat, they first went there to find bean cake to eat, and all the feces were scattered on this open space, so that the pigsty remained sanitary. After thinking of ways to find tricks like this, he used to sweat all over when he fed twenty or so pigs, but now he can feed one hundred and fifteen pigs by himself, and he can often find some time to read some books on pig raising techniques.

    How to make the sows give birth to more and better piglets? This was a question that Li Youxuan paid attention to from the beginning. But in the beginning, because he had no experience, every time the sow was pregnant, he was always afraid that the sow would not eat well, and every day, one sow was fed ten catties of bean cake. Last year, the No. 3 sow he fed gave birth to only eight piglets after being fed like this during pregnancy, and not many survived. Because of this incident, he was distressed. He visited the old farmers near the farm, and the old farmers told him that he should also feed some vegetables and the like during pregnancy, and it would not work to only feed bean cake. Li Youxuan also looked up some technical books on this subject, and gradually figured out the laws in this regard. In the second half of last year, it was still the No. 3 sow, which gave birth to twenty piglets in one litter, and eighteen survived.

    In order to improve the survival rate of the piglets as much as possible, Li Youxuan always stayed up all night when the sows gave birth. In the cold winter, he was afraid that the newborn piglets would freeze to death. At first, he always led the sows that were about to give birth to his own room, but because the pigsty was far away from his room, it was inconvenient, so he built an underground delivery room in the pigsty that was both sunny and sheltered from the wind. After the sows gave birth in the delivery room, the survival rate of the piglets reached 91%. There were many piglets, and they were often huddled together at night because they were afraid of the cold. Sometimes there were several layers on top of each other, and those at the bottom were often crushed to death. Therefore, every night, no matter how cold the weather was, Li Youxuan had to get up three or four times and blow a few whistles beside the pigsty. When the piglets heard the whistle, they got up and moved around, which avoided the situation of being crushed to death.

    In the past, the farm did not calculate the cost of feeding pigs, and a pig had to be fed ten or so catties of bean cake every day. In this way, the pigs were fattened, but the farmers around the farm could not stand it, and they all said that the farm fed pigs too wastefully, and the farmers could not afford to learn. After Li Youxuan heard these words, he began to study ways to save money and feed the pigs well. He saw that the pigs loved to eat sweet potato vines, so he suggested to the farm director to dry the sweet potato vines and store them; when feeding in winter, cook them in a pot and feed them to the pigs. He also accumulated old cabbage leaves, rice bran, corn cobs, and other substitutes, and accumulated a total of 370,000 catties in one autumn. Last year, because he paid attention to the use of substitutes, he saved a total of 32,000 catties of bean cake for the country.

    Due to his active work, he was selected as a labor model by the farm three times last year. Many students from schools came to the farm to visit the pigs he raised. Last year, he received more than 3,000 letters written to him by students from the county. Some expressed that they would study his spirit of dedication. Some said in their letters: After seeing your pig raising deeds, I have a more correct understanding that any work can emit a ray of light in the socialist construction cause.

    一个热爱养猪事业的初中毕业生
    新华社记者　张励中
    凡是到过河南省虞城县农场参观过的人都以惊奇的眼光，看着在一排整齐的猪圈里饲养着的一百多头猪。钟声响了，圈里的猪就一齐出来吃食；哨声一响，猪就一齐出圈活动；这里仿佛是个猪的学校。年青的养猪工人李友轩，亲昵地把这里饲养的大母猪都给编上了号，有时也出去放猪，还挑个大公猪骑上走几步呢。就是他，这个热爱养猪事业的初中毕业生，最近向省农业厅的一位负责同志郑重地提出了要求：在这个农场再养三十年猪，不要调动他的工作。
    1955年秋天，李友轩刚刚走出了初中的校门，到农场当养猪工人的时候，农场附近的小学生们见了他经常开玩笑地叫他是“猪校长”“猪倌”，家里的人们也常嘟哝地说他初中毕业去喂猪没出息。那时，他在这种不正确的轻视体力劳动的嘲笑下，真想把猪食挑子一扔不干了。后来，他听说在一次省劳模会上他们的农场被评成了全省特等模范农场，场内的职工受到了各方面的尊敬。他开始感到了劳动的光荣，并且还想起了猪和人民生活的关系：他想到城乡人民的需要，想到国家用猪肉从国外换回大批的拖拉机在田野上奔驰等等，他觉得养猪并不是所谓下贱的职业，他认识到养猪对建设社会主义是重要的贡献，从此立下了以养猪作为终身事业的志愿。以后，当孩子们再叫他“猪校长”时，他再不绕道回避，而是挺起了胸抬起了头。
    当李友轩初养猪的时候，还对这项工作一窍不通。喂猪时二十来头猪一齐跑上槽来，大猪挤小猪，强猪挤弱猪；越是瘦弱的越是抢不上食，越来越瘦。李友轩看着干着急，没办法。后来，他学习外地经验，采用了按大小分圈喂养的办法，才消除了这个混乱的情况。后来，猪越发展越多了。李友轩从喂二十来头猪，不到半年，就发展到了四五十头了。有大、有小，要分六七个圈喂养。他一天到晚光喂猪就够忙了，还要打扫猪圈，更不用说再多喂了。于是他便尽量想法减少不必要的劳动。他想起农民养猪要猪吃食时，总是叫出一种咯咯的声音，猪一听见就往家跑；他又想起在学校学习过的苏联巴甫洛夫条件反射的道理，他想把猪养成打钟吃食的习惯。于是他在一次喂猪的时候，便拿着一个铃使劲一摇，结果猪都抛开了食跑散了。这一次失败他没有灰心，第二次喂猪的时候，他又拿着铃轻轻的摇，虽然没有什么显著效果，但猪不跑了。以后，他每到喂猪时，就摇一次铃，后来这样慢慢养成了习惯，猪一听到铃声，就往猪食槽这边跑了。
    这个办法成功后，他接着便又分别采用打铃和吹哨两种方法，训练他所喂养的五、六圈猪分班吃食：一打铃，第一、二圈的猪出来吃食，三、四圈的猪不动。当第一班吃完了，他又一吹哨，三、四圈的猪出来吃食，一、二圈的猪回圈。另外，他在从猪圈里到食槽的路上，挖了一个小水坑，坑上的小空场里在每次喂猪时都撒上一点豆饼，猪出来吃食时先到那里找豆饼吃，大小便完全撒在这个空场上，使猪圈内保持卫生。经过这样想办法找窍门以后，原来他喂二十来头猪，还累得满头大汗，而现在他一个人便喂到了一百一十五头猪，还经常能抽出一些时间来看一些养猪技术的书。
    怎样才能使母猪生出更多、更好的小猪？这是李友轩在一开始就很注意的一个问题。但开始的时候因为他没经验，每次母猪怀孕了，总怕母猪吃不好，每天，一个母猪就喂十斤豆饼。去年他所喂养的三号母猪在怀孕期间，经他这样加工喂养，也只生出了八头小猪，而且成活不多。因为这件事，他苦恼过，他访问了农场附近的老农，老农告诉他，在孕期还应该喂点蔬菜之类的东西，光喂豆饼不行。李友轩又翻看了一些有关这方面的技术书籍，逐渐摸清了这方面的规律，就在去年的下半年，还是那个三号母猪，一胎生了二十个，成活十八个。
    为了尽量提高生下来的小猪的成活率，每到母猪生产时，李友轩总是彻夜不眠。在严寒的冬天，他怕生下来的小猪冻死，起初总是把快要生产的母猪领到自己屋里去，但是，因为猪圈离他住室远，不方便，他就在猪圈里修了个既向阳又避风的地下产室。母猪在产室生产后，小猪的成活率达到了91％。小猪多了，夜间怕冷常挤在一起，有时上下压好几层，压在底下的往往给压死了。因而每到夜间李友轩不管天气多么冷，总要起床三、四次，到猪圈旁吹几声哨子，小猪听到哨声起来活动，就避免了压死的情况。
    过去，农场喂猪不计算成本，一头猪每天要喂十来斤豆饼。这样，猪是喂肥了，但农场周围农民却看不惯，都说农场喂猪太浪费，农民学不起。李友轩听了这些话，就着手研究既节约又要喂好猪的办法。他看到猪对红薯秧很爱吃，便建议场长把红薯秧晒干了贮存起来；到冬天喂时，放在锅里煮了给猪吃。他还把老白菜叶、谷麸、玉米心等其他代用品积存起来，一个秋天共积存了三十七万斤。去年一年，由于他注意使用了代用品，共给国家节约三万二千斤豆饼。
    由于他的积极工作，去年他被农场三次评选为劳动模范。好多学校里的学生，到农场参观他养的猪。去年一年他收到了全县学生们给他写的三千多封信。有的表示要好好学习他的事业精神。有的在信上说：看到你的养猪事迹，才更正确的认识到，社会主义建设事业，不论任何工作都能发出一分光。
