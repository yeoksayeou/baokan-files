Xinhua News Agency: The Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has decided to launch a campaign among young workers throughout the city to increase production and conserve 10,000 taels of gold for the country in the first quarter. A mobilization meeting was held on the evening of the 7th; at the meeting, young workers stated that they would complete this task by learning technology, improving tools, and reducing defective products.

After the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was conveyed, many factories have launched production increase and conservation activities. For example, Ding Genru and another young worker at the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory can refrain from taking raw materials for four months without affecting product quality, using the waste materials they collect in their spare time for production. Jiangxi Paper Mill, Jiangxi Printing Factory and others have also launched activities to increase production by one ream of paper, save one sheet of paper, one bottle of ink, and one tael of lead respectively. In the first two days of the new year, Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory increased production and conserved 46 taels of gold.

The campaign to "Increase Production and Conserve 10,000 Taels of Gold for the Country" was decided by the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Youth League based on the requirements put forward at a recent city-wide meeting of League cadres from factories and mines.

    南昌市广大青年职工展开增产节约万两黄金活动
    新华社讯　中国新民主主义青年团南昌市委员会决定在全市青年职工中开展在第一季度里为国家增产节约一万两黄金的活动。7日晚上已召开了动员大会；在会上青年职工们表示要通过学习技术、改进工具、减少废品来完成这项任务。
    中共八届二中全会精神下达后，有不少工厂已展开了增产节约活动。如南昌柴油机厂青年工人丁根如等二人在不影响产品质量的情况下，可以四个月不领原料，用他们在业余时间里收集的废料生产。江西造纸厂、江西印刷厂等也分别开展了增产一令纸、节约一张纸、一瓶油墨和一两铅的活动。江西棉纺织印染工厂在新年的第二、第三两天就增产节约了四十六两黄金。
    开展“为国家增产节约一万两黄金”的活动，是青年团南昌市委根据最近一次全市厂矿企业团干部集会上提出的要求而决定的。
