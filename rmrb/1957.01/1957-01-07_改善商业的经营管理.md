    Improve Business Operations and Management
    Reduce Links, Lower Costs
    The purchase and sale prices of local and regional native products in Hebei Province differ too greatly. Purchase prices are low, and sale prices are high. At the grassroots supply and marketing cooperative in Jianping County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, the purchase price of pepper is 0.23 yuan per jin, while the local selling price is 0.37 to 0.38 yuan per jin.
    A major reason for the low purchase prices and high sale prices of native products is the overlapping of institutions and excessive intermediate links in state-owned businesses and supply and marketing cooperatives, leading to excessively high operating costs. Many native products handled by supply and marketing cooperatives are first acquired by grassroots cooperatives, then handed over to the county cooperative, then to the prefectural cooperative, and then the prefectural cooperative wholesales to the county cooperative, the county cooperative wholesales to the grassroots cooperative, and the grassroots cooperative wholesales to joint state-private enterprises, cooperative stores, cooperative groups, and small vendors, or they retail themselves. Some commodities purchased or sold on commission by the supply and marketing cooperative involve even more intermediate links.
    After the opening of the free market, the objective situation requires commercial departments to rapidly improve business operations and management and reduce commodity circulation costs in order to better serve production and the growing needs of the people.

    The Price of Leather Clothing is Too High
    The Zhangjiakou Prefectural Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized the supply and marketing cooperatives of eleven counties, including Zhangbei and Guyuan, and the Zhangjiakou City Industrial Leather Factory to sign contracts for more than 4,600 pieces of leather clothing last October. Because these leather clothes are of poor quality and high price, they cannot be sold. The Guyuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased a total of 580 pieces of various leather garments, but only one-fifth had been sold as of December 17 last year. The Chongli County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 320 pieces, but only sold twenty or thirty pieces.
    The main reason why leather clothing cannot be sold is that there are too many links in the leather clothing business, with costs added at each level, which increases the price of leather clothing. The leather hides acquired by the supply and marketing cooperatives on behalf of the prefectural purchasing bureau are first allocated by the prefectural purchasing bureau to the Zhangjiakou City Purchasing Station, and then the City Purchasing Station transfers them to the Industrial Leather Factory and the joint state-private leather factories under the leadership of the Zhangjiakou City General Company for processing. From acquisition to processing, there are a total of five links, with costs and profits added at each level. A leather garment with a length of three feet and three inches requires a cost of more than 50 yuan, plus the cost of transferring it to various counties, the retail price per piece reaches about 55 yuan.
    Why doesn't the prefectural purchasing bureau allocate the leather hides directly to the leather factories for processing? Why does the city purchasing station "sit in the den" and "not exert any effort" to make a profit of several percent? It is understood that in the cost accounting of leather clothing processed by the industrial leather factory, a 4% profit is also extracted for the general company to turn over. What kind of business operation is this?

    A "New Wine in Old Bottles" System
    I have worked in the Finance and Accounting Section of the Nanhui County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiangsu for more than four years, and most of the time I have been involved in pilot projects to improve business management at the grassroots level. However, after trying and trying, we always implement several systems with the same nature. In the spring of 1955, as soon as the pilot project to consolidate the "reporting and pricing, physical responsibility system" ended, we went to promote the "group business responsibility system" drafted by the Organization and Inspection Department of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Afterwards, the "comprehensive responsibility system," "price work responsibility system" of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the "property management responsibility system" (draft) issued by the Finance and Accounting Bureau of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives followed one after another. Starting from December 13 last year, we began to study the "Provisional Rules for Stores," "Manager's Code of Conduct for Stores," and "Salesperson's Code of Conduct" drafted by the Organization and Inspection Bureau of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. The central content of these systems is nothing more than strengthening commodity custody, reducing errors and losses, and formally formulating plans. The proliferation of systems in the supply and marketing cooperative system is unknown how much manpower and resources are wasted.
    I suggest that some comprehensive systems be established in the supply and marketing cooperative system to replace the current "numerous" systems.

### 改善商业的经营管理

    改善商业的经营管理
    减少环节，降低费用
    河北省地产、地销的土副产品的购销价相差太远。购价低，销价高。石家庄专区建屏县基层供销社，收购花椒的价格是每斤二角三分，在当地销售的价格每斤则为三角七分至三角八分。
    土副产品购价低、销价高的一个很大原因，是国营商业、供销社的机构重叠、中间环节过多，经营成本过大。供销社经营的土副产品，不少是基层社收购起来后，先交给县社，县社再交给专区社，以后再由专区社向县社批发，县社向基层社批发，基层社向公私合营、合作商店、合作小组、小商贩批发或自己零售。有些由供销社代购、代销的商品，中间环节就更多了。
    自由市场开放后，客观形势要求商业部门迅速改善经营管理，降低商品流通费用，以便更好地为生产、为人民日益增长的需要服务。

    皮衣的价格太高
    河北省供销社张家口专区办事处，在去年10月组织张北、沽源等十一个县供销社和张家口市工业制皮厂签订了四千六百多件皮衣合同。因为这些皮衣质次、价高，销不出去。沽源县供销社，共购进各种皮衣五百八十件，截至去年12月17日，仅销出五分之一。崇礼县供销社购进三百二十件，仅销出二、三十件。
    皮衣销不出去的主要原因，是经营皮衣的环节太多，层层加费用，提高了皮衣的价格。各地供销社代专区采购局收购的皮张，先由专区采购局拨给张家口市采购站，再由市采购站调给张家口市综合公司领导下的工业制皮厂和公私合营制皮厂进行加工。由收购到加工，共经过了五个环节，层层加费用、加利润。一件三尺三寸身长的皮衣，需要成本五十多元，加以调往各县时的费用，每件零售价即达五十五元左右。
    专区采购局为什么不把皮张直接拨给制皮厂加工呢？市采购站为什么“坐地窝”“不动劲”就牟取了百分之几的费用呢？据了解：工业制皮厂加工的皮衣，在成本核算中还给综合公司提取4％的上缴利润，这是什么经营方式呢？

    “换汤不换药”的制度
    我在江苏南汇县供销社财会科工作，已有四年多了，大部分时间在基层社搞改善经营管理的试点工作。但，试来试去，总是贯彻几个性质相同的制度。1955年春天，巩固“报货计价实物负责制”的试点工作刚结束，就去推行省供销合作社组织检查处拟订的“小组营业责任制”。以后，接踵而来的是省供销社的“全面责任制”、“物价工作责任制”，及全国合作总社财会局颁发的“财产管理责任制”（草稿）。去年12月13日起，又在开始学习全国合作总社组织检查局拟订的“商店暂行规则”、“商店经理守则”、“售货员守则”。这些制度，中心内容不外是加强商品保管、减少差错损耗、正规制定计划等。供销社系统的制度如此泛滥，不知浪费了多少人力和物力。
    我建议在供销合作社系统，建立一些综合性的制度，代替当前“名目繁多”的制度。
