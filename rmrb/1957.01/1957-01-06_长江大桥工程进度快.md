Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan News: The construction and installation work of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge completed 116% of the national annual plan by the end of 1956. Based on the rapid progress of various projects in 1956, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau decided, when arranging the 1957 project plan, to hand over the bridge to the state for acceptance within the first three quarters of the year.

Of the eight main bridge piers of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, four have been fully completed, and the other four have also been built out of the water or are approaching the design elevation. On the river surface near the Hanyang bank, three spans of steel beams have been erected; one span of steel beams has also been erected on the Wuchang bank. On the ground on both sides of the river, the frame beams and columns that are important components of the approach bridge have all been erected. Among them, most of the columns on the Hanyang bank have been connected into an arch-shaped frame structure, and the highway lane is being installed. The huge bridge abutments at the junction of the approach bridge and the main bridge have also reached elevations of more than 40 and 56 meters respectively, approaching the design requirements. The connecting lines and overpass projects on both sides have been completed or basically completed, with the exception of individual projects.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project is not only progressing rapidly, but the quality of the project is also very good. Test results prove that the quality of the various completed projects has reached or even exceeded the standards required by the state.

    长江大桥工程进度快
    据新华社武汉讯　武汉长江大桥的建筑安装工程到1956年年底共完成国家年度计划的116％。根据1956年各项工程进展迅速的情况，武汉长江大桥工程局在安排1957年工程计划时，决定要在头三个季度内把这座大桥交付国家验收。
    武汉长江大桥工程的八个正桥桥墩中，有四个全部建成，另外四个也筑出水面或接近于设计标高了。在靠近汉阳岸的江面上，已经架好了三孔钢梁；武昌岸的钢梁也架好一孔。在大江两岸的地面上，作为引桥重要组成部分的框梁柱子全部立起，其中汉阳岸的绝大部分柱子被连成圆拱形的排架结构，并且正在安装公路行车道。引桥和正桥接头处的庞大的桥台，也分别达到标高四十和五十六公尺以上，接近设计要求的标高。两岸的联络线和跨线桥工程，除个别工程外都完成或基本上完成。
    武汉长江大桥工程不仅进行得很快，工程质量也很好。试验结果证明，已经完成的各项工程的质量都达到甚至超过国家要求的标准。
