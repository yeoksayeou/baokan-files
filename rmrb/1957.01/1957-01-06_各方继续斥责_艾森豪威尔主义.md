	Various Parties Continue to Denounce the "Eisenhower Doctrine"

	Former Lebanese Prime Minister Says
	There is No Vacuum in the Middle East
	Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 4th (TASS dispatch): Former Lebanese Prime Minister Abdallah Yafi, in an article published in "Al-Siyasah," said that the U.S. Middle East plan, in the eyes of Arab peoples striving for freedom and independence, is a return to the policy of blocs and military alliances. He said it is strange for the United States to discuss the issue of using armed forces without going through the United Nations, because there is no vacuum in the Middle East.

	Egyptian "Al-Ahram" Says
	The United States Does Not Allow Middle Eastern Countries to be Independent
	Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 5th: "Al-Ahram," in commenting on the new U.S. plan to control the Middle East, said that no matter what motivates the United States to take a new attitude toward the Middle East, it is clearly eager to fill the "vacuum" created by the weakening of British and French power in the region. It said that this naturally means that it does not believe that Middle Eastern countries are capable of filling the so-called "vacuum" in the region. This is no different from the proposition of not allowing Middle Eastern countries to be independent and placing them under trusteeship.

	British Labour Leader Bevan Says
	Britain Retreats, America Enters
	Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th: British Labour Party Treasurer and Foreign Affairs Spokesman Aneurin Bevan criticized the U.S. Middle East policy known as the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

	In an article published in the weekly "Tribune" on the 4th, Bevan said: "Britain retreats, America enters. Wherever Britain seems too weak militarily or financially, American power steps in to take over." He believes that the purpose of the U.S. approach is to bypass the United Nations and follow in the footsteps of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt.

	Bevan accused the U.S. Middle East policy of being dollar diplomacy. He said: "American aid provided in this way will be seen in the Middle East as just another stage in the Cold War. It will also be seen as replacing British and French imperialism with American imperialism. … This will be seen as a more ambitious version of the Baghdad Pact." Bevan emphasized: "Dollars are more plentiful than pounds, but they are not necessarily more welcome if they carry the scent of imperialist intrusion."

	"Pakistan Times" Editorial Says
	The United States Wants to Accelerate its Penetration of the Middle East
	Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 5th: "Pakistan Times" published an editorial on the 3rd, saying that Washington's actions recently referred to as the "Eisenhower Doctrine" can only be said to be intended to "accelerate the strategic, economic, and political penetration of the United States into the (Middle East) region." The actions of the United States "will be a harbinger of the expansion of the Cold War region and the intensification of tensions."

	The newspaper said: "It is strange that the U.S. government has drawn up a plan to so-called protect the territory of other countries' peoples thousands of miles from the U.S. coast and seems to be implementing it without consulting the governments concerned."

	The newspaper exposed the U.S. excuse, namely the so-called "Soviet aggression and subversion." The newspaper said: "This is the excuse put forward by Britain after launching an invasion of Egypt in order to quell hostile criticism." The way in which Britain and its allies recently sought to "protect" Egypt from Soviet "threats" has given the Arabs a lesson they can never forget. The newspaper pointed out that the lesson is that they must never allow themselves to be "protected" by others.

### 各方继续斥责“艾森豪威尔主义”

    各方继续斥责“艾森豪威尔主义”
    黎巴嫩前总理说
    中东没有真空
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特4日讯：黎巴嫩前总理阿卜杜拉·雅非在“政治报”上发表文章说，美国的中东计划，在力求自由和独立的阿拉伯人民看来，是退回到集团和军事联盟的政策上去。他说，中东没有真空，因此，美国讨论不经过联合国而使用武装部队的问题，是令人奇怪的。
    埃及“金字塔报”说
    美国不让中东国家自主
    新华社开罗5日电　“金字塔报”在评论美国企图控制中东的新计划时说，不管什么动机驱使美国想对中东采取新的态度，显而易见它是迫切想填补由于英法在这个地区的力量的削弱所造成的“真空”。它说，这自然就意味着它不相信中东国家能够填补西方所谓的在这个地区的“真空”。这同不让中东国家自主而要把它们置于托管之下的主张没有区别。
    英工党领袖比万说
    英国一退出，美国就进去
    据新华社伦敦4日电　英国工党司库和外交事务发言人比万抨击被称为“艾森豪威尔主义”的美国中东政策。
    比万4日在“论坛”周报发表的文章中说：“英国一退出，美国就进去。凡是在英国在军事上或财政上显得太软弱的地方，美国的力量就来接手。”他认为，美国的这种做法，目的是想绕过联合国而步英法侵略埃及的后尘。
    比万指责美国的中东政策是美元外交政策。他说：“以这样的方式提供的美援，在中东会被看成不过是冷战中的另一个阶段。这也会被人认为是用美帝国主义来代替英法帝国主义。……这将被认为是巴格达条约的更加野心勃勃的翻版。”比万强调说：“美元比英镑要多，但是一带上帝国主义渗入的气味，它们就不见得比较受欢迎一些。”
    “巴基斯坦时报”社论说
    美国想加速对中东的渗透
    据新华社卡拉奇5日电　“巴基斯坦时报”3日发表社论说，最近被人称为“艾森豪威尔主义”的华盛顿的行动，只能说是为了想“加速美国对（中东）地区的战略的、经济的和政治的渗透”。美国的行动“将是冷战地区扩大和紧张局势加剧的前兆”。
    这家报纸说：“真奇怪，美国政府已经拟订了所谓保护离美国海岸数千英里的其他国家人民的领土的计划，而且看来将不同有关各国政府商量而加以执行。”
    这家报纸揭露了美国的借口，那就是所谓“苏联的侵略和颠复活动”。报纸说：“这是英国在对埃及发动侵略以后为了平息敌对的批评而提出的借口。”英国和它的盟国最近设法“保护”埃及免遭苏联
  “威胁”的那种方式已经给了阿拉伯人一个他们永远不能忘记的教训。报纸指出，这个教训就是，他们决不可以让自己受别人“保护”。
