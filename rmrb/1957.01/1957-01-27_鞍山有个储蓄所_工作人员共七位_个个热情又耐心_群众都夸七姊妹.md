Anshan Has a Savings Office With Seven Staff Members; Each is Enthusiastic and Patient; The Masses Praise the Seven Sisters
The seven savings clerks at the North Second Road Street Savings Office in Anshan are all women, and they are affectionately called the Seven Sisters by the old depositors. In the past two years, the Seven Sisters have absorbed 650,000 yuan in savings deposits.

The savings office receives two to three hundred workers and housewives every day who come to withdraw or deposit money. The Seven Sisters not only receive everyone with enthusiasm and patience, but also constantly publicize the significance of participating in savings, so that many depositors have developed the habit of withdrawing money as they need it. Cui Shuangxi, a worker at Angang, only keeps a few yuan for meal tickets after each salary payment, and deposits the rest in the savings office. Once, when he came to withdraw money, it happened to be Wednesday afternoon, when the savings office was closed. The savings clerk, Yang Hua, took the initiative to lend him her own money to buy meal tickets.

These Seven Sisters are always thinking of the masses. Last year, they successively introduced five or six advanced deposit methods with simplified procedures. Now it only takes a little over a minute to complete a current savings transaction. Some people say, "I would rather walk a little further to deposit money here!"

After each lottery drawing, they also help depositors find winning numbers. Last November, an old man came to the savings office to deposit money. Fan Shuqing took the deposit book and said with a smile, "Grandpa, you won the third prize last time!" The old man happily said, "Good girl, thanks for telling me, otherwise I wouldn't have known!" Then he happily left with the twenty yuan prize money.

Last year, the Seven Sisters also assisted the public security organs in cracking four theft cases. One evening, Zhang Dengyu, an Angang worker, called the savings office and said that his deposit book was lost in the dormitory and asked them to help find it. This matter aroused their close attention. The next day at noon, when the savings office was busy, a middle-aged man came and said he wanted to withdraw all of his 105 yuan deposit. Yang Hua took the deposit book and saw that it was indeed Zhang Dengyu's. She asked, "Are you Zhang Dengyu?" The man pretended to be calm and said, "Yes." "What did you say when you called me yesterday?" Yang Hua asked. The guy stammered a few words and slipped away. That evening, the public security organs arrested the thief.

Last year, five of the Seven Sisters were elected as advanced workers. The North Second Road Street Savings Office was also named the "March 8th Savings Office."

### 鞍山有个储蓄所　工作人员共七位  个个热情又耐心　群众都夸七姊妹

    鞍山有个储蓄所　工作人员共七位
    个个热情又耐心　群众都夸七姊妹
    鞍山北二道街储蓄所的七个储蓄员，全部是女同志，她们被老储户们亲切地称为七姊妹。七姊妹在两年多来已吸储了六十五万元储蓄存款。
    这个储蓄所每天要接待二、三百个取款或存款的职工和家庭妇女，七姊妹不但很热情和耐心地接待每一个人，而且随时向他们宣传参加储蓄的意义，使很多储户都养成了随用随取的习惯。鞍钢工人崔双喜每次发了工资后，只留几元买饭票的钱，余下的都存入储蓄所。有一次他来取钱，刚巧是星期三下午，储蓄所不办公，储蓄员杨华就主动把自己的钱借给他买饭票。
    这七姊妹处处为群众着想。去年先后推行了五、六种简化手续的先进存款方法，现在只需一分多钟就能办完一笔活期储蓄。有的群众说：“宁肯多走一段路，也要到这里来存款！”
    每次开奖以后，她们还帮助存款户找中奖号码。去年11月间，一位老大爷来储蓄所存款，范淑卿拿过存折一看，就笑着说：“老大爷，您上期得三奖啦！”老大爷高兴地说：“好姑娘，亏你告诉我，要不然我那里知道呢！”随后拿着二十元奖金高兴地走了。
    七姊妹去年还协助公安机关破获四起盗窃案。有一天晚上，鞍钢职工张登余给储蓄所打电话说，他的存折在宿舍里丢了，要她们帮助查找。这事引起了她们的密切注意。第二天晌午，储蓄所正忙的时候，来了一个中年人，说要将一百零五元存款全部取回，杨华接过存折一看，正是张登余的。就问道：“你是张登余吗？”那个人故作镇静地说：“是啊。”“你昨天给我挂电话说些什么？”杨华追问。那家伙支吾了两句就溜走了。当晚，公安机关逮捕了这个盗窃犯。
    去年，七姊妹中有五个人当选为先进工作者。北二道街储蓄所也被命名为“三八储蓄所”。
