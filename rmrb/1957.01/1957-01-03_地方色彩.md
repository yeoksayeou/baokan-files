    Local Color

    Although not from northern Shaanxi, I am very interested in "Xintianyou"; although not from Hunan, I also like to listen to "Huagudiao". According to insiders, this is because "Xintianyou" and "Huagudiao" have strong local characteristics.
    I think this only touches on one aspect of the issue. That is, "Xintianyou," "Huagudiao," and others such as "Yunnan Flower Lantern," "Henan Bangzi," "Inner Mongolia Folk Songs," "Xinjiang Folk Songs," etc., have their own unique national styles and strong local characteristics, so they are warmly welcomed by the people.
    The other aspect of the problem is the love of the common people. Every nation has its unique customs, unique interests and hobbies; in order to express their thoughts and feelings, they also have their unique musical language. It is precisely these unique things that make our lives rich and colorful! It is precisely these tunes with national styles that enrich the musical art of our entire country.
    The Chinese people welcome musical tunes with Chinese style and Chinese characteristics, and there is no need to doubt this. Not only that, music with national style and local characteristics, like having wings, flies across borders and plays a great role in the cultural life of the people of the world.
    I believe that our musicians should now explore and inherit the rich musical heritage of our motherland, and on this basis, create music with Chinese style and Chinese characteristics.
    However, why are there not many good songs that are truly welcomed by the masses, and why are the works of some composers not widely sung?
    The masses urgently need to sing, but the works of composers do not quite suit the taste of the masses, which is indeed a contradiction. How can this contradiction be resolved? I think only the composers themselves understand best.

    地方色彩
    徐叔华
    虽然不是陕北人，但对“信天游”很感兴趣；虽然不是湖南人，也很喜欢听“花鼓调”。据内行人解释，是因为“信天游”和“花鼓调”具有浓厚的地方色彩的缘故。
    我认为，这还只说到问题的一个方面。即“信天游”、“花鼓调”，以及其他如“云南花灯”、“河南梆子”、“内蒙民歌”、“新疆民歌”等等的本身，有他们各自独特的民族风格和浓厚的地方色彩，所以受到人民群众的热烈欢迎。
    问题的另一方面，即老百姓的喜爱问题。任何一个民族，都有他独特的风土人情，独特的兴趣和爱好；为了表达他们的思想感情，也就有他独特的音乐语言。正因为这些独特的东西，使我们的生活变得丰富多采！正因为这些具有民族风格的曲调，丰富了我们整个国家的音乐艺术。
    中国的老百姓欢迎具有中国气派的、中国特色的音乐曲调，这一点是用不着怀疑的。不仅如此，具有民族风格、地方色彩的音乐像长上了翅膀，飞越过国境，在世界人民的文化生活中起着莫大的作用。
    我认为：我们的音乐家目前要多多发掘和继承我们祖国丰富的音乐遗产，并在这基础上创造出具有中国气派、中国特色的音乐来。
    但是，为什么目前真正受到群众欢迎的好歌不多，而一些作曲家的作品又唱不开去呢？
    群众迫切地需要歌唱，但作曲家的作品却不大合群众的口味，这的确是一个矛盾。这个矛盾究竟如何解决呢？我想只有作曲家本身最懂得了。
