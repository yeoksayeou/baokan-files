Reader's Letter:

    Sent Publications Should Consider Needs
    To the Editorial Comrade:
    There is a trend in many government organizations to send publications everywhere. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions receives an average of more than thirty internal publications, materials, conference special issues, and so on from other government organizations every week. More than one-third of these publications are irrelevant or have very little relevance to our work.
    For example, the State Taxation Bureau and the Beijing Taxation Bureau send us "People's Taxation" and "Taxation Work Bulletin" every issue; the People's Insurance Company of China sends "People's Insurance," "Red Cross of China," and "Beijing Red Cross"; the Ministry of Health sends "Health Work Bulletin," and other publications. These publications are of no use to us, so they are archived after receipt and no one ever looks at them.
    Also, many provincial and municipal trade union organizations send things like member representative conference proceedings, special issues of labor model representative conferences, and collections of activist representative meetings. These publications are purely commemorative in nature, and it is worth studying whether they should be printed at all, and it is even more wasteful to print them and send them everywhere. Secondly, we also receive posters and propaganda paintings of sports meets and art performances held by trade union organizations in various places, which are completely useless.
    The organizations that send publications always have the idea: "Sending it to you might be useful in some way!" But what is the use? They certainly can't say.
    Let us receive fewer unnecessary publications! Ma Ning

### 赠送刊物要看需要

    赠送刊物要看需要编辑同志：
    现在许多机关有一种到处赠送刊物的风气。我们北京市工会联合会平均每周都要收到三十多件左右其他机关赠送的内部刊物、资料、会议专刊等等。这些刊物中有三分之一以上和我们业务无关或关系很少。
    比如说，税务总局和北京市税务局每期给我们送来“人民税务”、“税务工作通报”；中国人民保险公司送来“人民保险”、“中国红十字”、“北京红十字”；卫生部送来“卫生工作通报”等刊物。这些刊物对我们没有什么用处，所以收到后即存档，从来没有人去看它们。
    又如，不少省市工会组织送来会员代表大会会刊、劳动模范代表大会专刊、积极分子代表会议汇刊之类的东西。这些刊物纯粹是纪念性质的，要不要印都值得研究，而印出后还到处赠送，这更是浪费。其次，我们还收到各地工会组织举办的运动会、文艺会演的招贴画、宣传画等，更是毫无用处。
    赠送刊物的机关总有这样的想法：“寄给你们或多或少总有些用处吧！”但到底有什么用处呢？他们也一定说不上来。
    让我们少收到一些不必要寄给我们的刊物吧！　马宁
