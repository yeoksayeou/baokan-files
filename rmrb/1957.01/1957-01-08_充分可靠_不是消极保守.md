    "Sufficiently Reliable" is Not Passive Conservatism
    The "Liaoning Daily" published an editorial on January 4th entitled "Sufficiently Reliable is Not Passive Conservatism," pointing out that some comrades in factories and mines are now one-sidedly understanding the Central Committee's call to launch the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and the instruction that the 1957 plan should be based on a fully reliable foundation, and are adopting a passive attitude towards increasing production and practicing economy. They believe that only by making the plan more conservative can it be safe and "fully reliable." They regard "making appropriate compressions in some areas" as not distinguishing which areas or under what circumstances, and compressing the plan whenever there are difficulties (even though they can be overcome). They turn "increasing production and practicing economy must be carried out under the condition that raw materials are guaranteed" into "wait for the higher authorities to guarantee raw materials before proceeding," and do not mobilize the masses to overcome difficulties and strive for conditions themselves. In some units, the enthusiasm for exploring the potential of raw materials everywhere when formulating plans last year is gone, and they call for compressing the plan as soon as they encounter material difficulties. Obviously, this is a one-sided understanding of the principle of full reliability, and it is not in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.
    The editorial said: Many comrades in factories and mines feel: "Last year, we went too far, and as a result, we were passive everywhere, scolded by superiors and subordinates, and annoyed by everyone. This year, we must learn from this lesson and not be reckless again." Therefore, when considering this year's production and increase production and economy plans, they add unnecessary "insurance coefficients" in all aspects. The editorial believes that the achievements in production and construction last year were enormous, and many things were done correctly and well. This is the basic aspect, the essence and the mainstream. Believing that last year was "completely worthless" is not only inconsistent with the facts, but will only lead to passivity and timidity. The editorial said: Some things in last year's production and construction were reckless. These lessons of rash advance must be learned, but when criticizing last year's shortcomings, we must combine it with the study of this year's actual situation, make specific analysis, and summarize specifically. Otherwise, it may be a case of "propping up the east and the west collapses," and conservative ideas will grow again after criticizing rash advances.
    The editorial said: The fact that many factories and mines have been slow to mobilize the masses is also related to the lack of specific analysis of last year's lessons. Some comrades more or less believe that "last year was a case of mobilizing the masses to be reckless." The editorial believes that this view is incorrect. It is precisely because many factories and mines mobilized the masses more fully last year and discovered a large amount of potential that they achieved great results in production. As long as the leaders strengthen investigation and research, keep a clear head, have a clear understanding, and properly grasp and guide, and combine mobilizing the masses with strengthening leadership, there will be no deviation. Now, we should learn from this aspect and mobilize the masses better, rather than not mobilizing the masses.
    The editorial said: There are also enterprises where the state has reduced the tasks this year, and the existing raw materials and equipment capacity is sufficient to cope with, and it is not difficult to complete the tasks. Therefore, the leaders also relax. The editorial believes that this attitude is also incorrect. The principle of increasing production and practicing economy and running enterprises diligently and thriftily applies to all enterprises. Enterprises that need and can increase production should increase production as much as possible; and enterprises that do not need or cannot increase production, like all other enterprises, should actively take action, take various measures to improve quality, reduce costs, ensure safety, and practice strict economy.
    The editorial calls on all enterprises: They should correctly understand and fully utilize the existing conditions of their units, actively overcome difficulties, create conditions, increase production as much as possible if they can and need to, and save as much as possible if they should, and do more with less money. This is in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.

### “充分可靠”不是消极保守

    “充分可靠”不是消极保守
    “辽宁日报”1月4日以“充分可靠不是消极保守”为题发表社论，指出现在有些厂矿企业的同志，片面地理解中央提出的开展增产节约运动的号召和1957年的计划要放在充分可靠的基础上的指示，对增产节约采取了消极的态度。他们认为只有把计划订得保守一点，才保险，才“充分可靠”；他们把“在某些方面作适当的压缩”，看成不分哪些方面，也不分什么情况，有困难（虽然能克服）就压缩计划；把“增产节约必须在原料有保证的条件下进行”，变成“只等上级给原料保证再进行”，自己不去发动群众克服困难，努力争取条件。在有些单位里，去年编制计划时那种到处发掘原料潜力的积极性没有了，一遇到材料困难就叫压缩计划。很明显，这是片面理解充分可靠的方针，是不符合增产节约精神的。
    社论说：许多厂矿的同志觉得：“去年搞冒了，结果闹得处处被动，上下挨骂，左右受气，今年可得接受这个教训，别再冒了。”因而在考虑今年的生产和增产节约计划时，在各方面都加不必要的“保险系数”。社论认为：去年在生产建设中的成绩是巨大的，很多事情是办对了，办好了，这是基本的方面，是本质和主流；认为去年“一无是处”，那不仅不符合事实，而且只会弄得消极胆怯。社论说：去年的生产建设中有些事情是办冒了，这些冒进的教训是要吸取的，但是在批评去年缺点的时候，要结合研究今年的实际情况，具体地分析，具体地总结。不然，就可能“扶得东来西又倒”，在批判了冒进之后又滋长保守思想。
    社论说：许多厂矿迟迟不发动群众，也同对去年的教训缺乏具体分析有关系。有些同志或多或少地认为“去年就是发动群众起来搞冒了”。社论认为这种看法是不对的。正是因为许多厂矿去年比较充分地发动了群众，发掘出大量潜力，才在生产上取得了很大成绩。只要领导人员加强调查研究，头脑冷静，心中有数，妥善掌握和引导，把发动群众和加强领导相结合，那就不会发生偏差。现在，我们正是应该从这方面接受教训，把群众发动得更好，而不是不去发动群众。
    社论说：也有的企业，今年国家给缩减了任务，现有的原材料和设备能力足以应付，完成任务不费力，于是领导人员也松劲了。社论认为这种态度也是不对的。增产节约、勤俭办企业的方针，适用于一切企业。需要又可能增产的企业，应该尽量增产；而不需要，或者不可能增产的企业和其他一切企业一样，都应该积极行动起来，采取各种办法提高质量，降低成本，保证安全，厉行节约。
    社论号召各企业：应当正确地认识并且充分地利用本单位的现有条件，积极地克服困难，创造条件，能够增产而且需要增产的尽量增产，应当节约的一定节约，用最少的钱办更多的事，这样才符合增产节约的精神。
