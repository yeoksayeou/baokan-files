    “Small Farms," Big Contributions

    Xinhua News Agency reported that the Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Minjian Township, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, had a bumper grain harvest in 1956, with an average yield of 1,009 catties per mu, an increase of 43% over 1955. The cooperative members all believe that the cooperative's "small farms" played a good role in increasing production. After the establishment of the cooperative in 1954, the cooperative selected five members with rich production experience to form a technical research group to oversee various experiments on the experimental land (which the members called the "small farm"). Any production experience from other places had to be successfully tested on the "small farm" before it could be promoted throughout the cooperative.

    The "small farm's" experiments provided many important insights, which helped the cooperative avoid a lot of subjectivism in production. For example, when planting corn in 1956, some people advocated "single-row double-plant close planting," while others advocated "double-row double-plant close planting." The technical research group told everyone the results of the 1955 experiments on the "small farm": "Single-row double-plant close planting" yielded 390 catties per mu, "single-row single-plant close planting" yielded 298 catties per mu, and "double-row double-plant close planting" yielded 150 catties per mu. As a result of promoting "single-row double-plant close planting," the cooperative achieved a new record of an average yield of 425 catties per mu. Sweet potato "double-row double-ridge close planting" had achieved high yields in other places; however, the Victory Agricultural Cooperative's "small farm" found that the soil was not suitable after testing. Therefore, in 1956, the cooperative adopted "single-row single-ridge close planting" for planting sweet potatoes, resulting in an average yield of 2,400 catties per mu, which was a rare good harvest.

    The Victory Agricultural Cooperative also frequently organized members to visit the "small farm," which was very helpful in changing the conservative thinking of some members.

    In the process of promoting new production technologies and production experience from other places, agricultural cooperatives must adhere to the principle of conducting key experiments first and then gradually promoting them in order to avoid the pitfalls of subjectivism. Each agricultural cooperative can allocate a small piece of experimental land according to its own needs for developing production, and can learn from the "small farm" of the Victory Agricultural Cooperative to truly enable the experimental land to play the role of key experimentation and demonstration.

    “小农场”，大贡献
    据新华社报道，四川省内江县民建乡胜利农业社1956年粮食大丰收，平均每亩产一千零九斤，比1955年增加43％。社员们都认为社里的“小农场”对于增产发挥了良好的作用。1954年建社以后，社里挑选五个生产经验丰富的社员，组成技术研究组，主持试验地（社员们叫它“小农场”）的各项试验。凡是外地的生产经验，总要在“小农场”里试验成功以后才在全社推广。
    “小农场”的试验提供许多重要的情况，使这个社在生产上避免了不少主观主义。如1956年播种玉米的时候，有人主张“单行双株密植”，还有人主张“双行双株密植”。技术研究组把1955年在“小农场”里试验的结果告诉大家：“单行双株密植”每亩产三百九十斤，“单行单株密植”每亩产两百九十八斤，“双行双株密植”每亩产一百五十斤。社里推广“单行双株密植”的结果，获得平均每亩产四百二十五斤的新纪录。红薯“双行双埂密植”，在外地曾经获得高额产量；但是胜利农业社的“小农场”在试验以后，发现土质不适宜。因此，1956年这个社种红薯采用“单行单埂密植”，结果平均每亩产二千四百斤，是少见的好收成。
    胜利农业社还经常组织社员到“小农场”里去参观，对于改变部分社员的保守思想很有作用。
    农业社在推广新的生产技术和外地生产经验当中，要想避免吃主观主义的亏，就得坚持先作重点试验，然后逐步推广的原则。各个农业社都可以根据自己发展生产的需要，划出一小块试验地，并且可以学习胜利农业社的“小农场”那样，使试验地真正发挥重点试验和示范的作用。
