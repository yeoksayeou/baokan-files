Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 10th: The opening ceremony for the Lhasa-Zedang highway was held here yesterday. This is the second highway crossing the Yarlung Zangbo River.

More than a thousand people from all walks of life in Lhasa gathered in front of the Potala Palace yesterday to celebrate another happy event for the Tibetan people. Thirty-two trucks loaded with supplies set off, led by two Liberation-brand trucks decorated as floats. People presented hadas to the drivers and threw bouquets at the cars. Three years ago, the people of Lhasa celebrated the simultaneous opening of the Kang-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet highways here; two years ago, the first batch of vehicles heading to Xigaze also departed from here. Now, the opening ceremony is being held for the third time. The new highway connects two ancient cities on the Tibetan Plateau. The location of the last grassroots administrative office in the Tibetan region without road access is now accessible by car.

Liu Xia·Tudengtaba, acting secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, thanking the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao for helping the Tibetan people build this highway. He said, "People call the Kang-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet highways happy roads leading to Lhasa, and now there is another happy road from Lhasa to Zedang. It will promote the development of political, economic, and cultural undertakings in Lhasa and the Shannan region."

Fan Ming, deputy secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his congratulatory speech that the construction of the Lhasa-Zedang Highway is a major achievement for the Tibetan people in implementing the resolution of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and building the motherland and Tibet.

The Shannan region spans the west bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River and is one of Tibet's rich agricultural and pastoral areas. Zedang is an important town in this region, and both it and Lhasa once nurtured Tibetan culture and have close economic ties. The salt, tea, and production tools needed by the people of the Shannan region are supplied through Lhasa. The grain, wool, and famous handmade woolen fabric of Shannan are mainly sold in Lhasa and transported to various places. In the past, it took four to five days to travel between the two places by horse, and four days to travel from Lhasa to Zedang by yak-skin boat. After the opening of this 190-kilometer highway, the journey can be completed in one day.

    又一条公路跨过雅鲁藏布江
    拉萨各阶层庆祝泽当—拉萨公路通车
    新华社拉萨10日电　拉萨到泽当的公路的通车典礼，昨天在这里举行。这是横跨雅鲁藏布江的第二条公路。
    一千多拉萨市各阶层人民，昨天聚集在布达拉宫前庆祝西藏人民的又一件喜事。三十二辆满载物资的汽车开动了，走在前面的是两辆解放牌汽车装饰成的彩车。人们向驾驶员献了哈达，把花束抛向汽车。三年以前拉萨市人民在这里庆祝康藏、青藏公路同时通车；两年以前开向日喀则的第一批汽车，也是从这里出发。现在是第三次举行通车典礼了。新的公路把西藏高原两座古老城市连接起来。西藏地区最后一个没有通车的机巧级办事处所在地，现在也通汽车了。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会代理秘书长柳霞·土登塔巴在剪彩仪式上讲话，感谢中央人民政府和毛主席帮助西藏人民修筑了这条公路。他说：“人们称康藏、青藏公路是通向拉萨的幸福道路，那么拉萨到泽当又有了一条幸福的道路了。它将促进拉萨和山南地区的政治、经济和文化事业的发展。”
    中共西藏工委副书记范明在祝贺词中说：拉泽公路的修筑，是西藏人民贯彻执行西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员会的决议，为建设祖国建设西藏的一项重大成就。
    山南地区跨雅鲁藏布江西岸，是西藏富饶的农、牧业区之一。泽当是这个地区的重镇，它和拉萨都曾经孕育了西藏的文化，经济上也有密切的联系。山南地区人民需要的盐、茶和生产工具靠通过拉萨供给。山南的粮食、羊毛和驰名全藏的手工纺织的毛哔叽，主要销售拉萨和转运各地。过去来往两地骑马要四、五天，从拉萨乘牛皮船到泽当也要四天；这条一百九十多公里长的公路通车后，一天就可以到达。
