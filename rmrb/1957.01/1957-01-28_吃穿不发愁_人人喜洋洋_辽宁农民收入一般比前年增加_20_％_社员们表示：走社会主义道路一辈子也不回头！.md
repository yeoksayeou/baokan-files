Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 26th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Shaoshan) The autumn harvest distribution work of agricultural cooperatives in Liaoning Province in 1956 has basically ended, and the income of more than 80% of the commune members in the province has increased. According to typical surveys in various places, the income of ordinary farmers has generally increased by more than 20% compared with 1955; for many, it has increased by half to one or two times. Calculated on a per capita basis, the annual income per person is about seventy or eighty yuan, which is more than enough for food and clothing.

With the increase in income, the lives of farmers have greatly improved, and their purchasing power has greatly increased. In the fourth quarter of last year, farmers purchased 26% more goods than in the same period in 1955. State-owned commercial companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places supplied farmers with cloth, averaging more than 50 feet per household in the province; during the same period, an average of one thermos bottle was newly added for every two households, and every three households bought a pair of rubber shoes. After the Xiangqian Agricultural Cooperative in Laijia Township, Yingkou County, distributed cash in October last year, the commune members bought more than 260 flannel shirts from the local supply and marketing cooperative within a few days, which was equal to the total number of flannel shirts supplied by this supply and marketing cooperative in the fourth quarter of 1955.

The surplus money in the hands of farmers has also increased, and they have flocked to banks or credit cooperatives to save money. In the fourth quarter of last year, the rural savings balance in the province reached more than 55 million yuan, an increase of 150% over the same period in 1955. Calculated based on the total number of farm households in the province, the average deposit per household is more than 18 yuan. In some areas, the number of farm households participating in savings accounts for 70% of the total number of farm households. Many households that had been in debt for a long time have now become depositors. Liu Jiming, a member of the Hetaoshu Township Agricultural Cooperative in Suizhong County, cleared his debts from many years ago due to increased income last autumn, and deposited more than 80 yuan in the bank for the first time in his life.

At present, farmers in this province are carrying out winter production and preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival. Farmers have created various folk songs and rhymes, praising the benefits of cooperation everywhere, and expressing their determination to continue on the socialist road. The lyrics of two folk songs widely circulated in the Liaoyang area say: "Cooperation is really commendable, there is food to eat, clothes to wear, and money to spend, the grain and grass are delivered to the home, and the commune members are laughing." In the past, the land was barren and the clothes were torn, and you barely made enough to live year after year; now the land is fertile and the granaries are full, everyone is joyful, there is no worry about food and clothing, and we will never turn back on the socialist road in our lifetime.”

    吃穿不发愁　人人喜洋洋
    辽宁农民收入一般比前年增加20％
    社员们表示：走社会主义道路一辈子也不回头！
    新华社沈阳26日电　新华社记者杨绍山报道：辽宁省各地农业社1956年的秋收分配工作已经基本结束，全省80％以上的社员都增加了收入。据各地典型调查，一般农民的收入都比1955年增加20％以上；多者增加半倍到一、两倍。按人口平均计算每人全年收入都在七、八十元左右，吃、穿有余。
    随着收入的增加，农民生活有了很大改善，农民购买力大大提高。去年第四季度农民购买的商品比1955年同一时期增多26％。各地国营商业公司和供销合作社供应农民的布匹，平均全省每户农民就有五十多尺；同一时期，平均每两户人家还新添一个暖水瓶，每三户农民买了一双胶鞋。营口县赖家乡向前农业社去年10月间分配现金之后，社员们在几天之内就在当地供销社买了二百六十多件绒衣，等于这个供销社1955年第四季度供应绒衣的总数。
    农民手中的余钱也增加了，都纷纷到银行或信用社去储蓄存款。去年第四季度全省农村储蓄余额达到五千五百多万元，比1955年同期增加一倍半。按全省总农户计算平均每户农民存款十八元多。有些地区参加储蓄的农户占总农户的70％，过去许多长期欠债户，现在也变成了存款户。绥中县核桃树乡农业社社员刘纪明，因为收入增多，去秋还清多年的债务后，有生以来第一次在银行里存了八十多元钱。
    目前，这个省的农民正在开展冬季生产和准备欢度春节。农民们编出各种各样的民歌和顺口溜，到处歌颂合作化的好处，表示要继续走社会主义道路的决心。在辽阳地区广为流传的两首民歌的歌词说：“合作化真可夸，有吃有穿有钱花，粮草送到家，社员笑哈哈”，过去是地了场光衣裳破，一年挣一年光；现在是地了场光粮满仓，人人喜洋洋，吃穿都不愁，走社会主义道路一辈子也不回头”。
