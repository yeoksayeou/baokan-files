    Three Telephone Operators
    In the telephone room of the local state-owned Taiyuan Slag Factory, there is only one phone, but three young women are often sitting there doing needlework, reading, or chatting. They are all newly recruited telephone operators, hired because the factory is preparing to install a telephone switchboard. Since the switchboard hasn't been installed yet, the three of them have to watch a single phone and "call people" whenever needed.
    When will the switchboard be installed? Even if the switchboard is installed, with only nine lines, do we really need three telephone operators?

    三个电话员
    地方国营太原石渣厂电话室里只有一部单机，却经常坐着三位青年妇女在做针线，看书或闲谈。她们都是新录用的电话员，是为了厂里准备安电话总机才录用的。由于总机还没有安好，现在只好三个人看一部单机，随时“叫人”。
    什么时候才能安好总机呢？即使总机安好，仅有九部机子的总机，难道也要三个电话员吗？
