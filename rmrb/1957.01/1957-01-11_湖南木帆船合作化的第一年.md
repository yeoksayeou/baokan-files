Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 10th: Wooden sailboats, which account for 50% of Hunan Province's water and land freight volume, have demonstrated the superiority of organization after realizing cooperativization in 1956. Last year, the province's sixty-seven wooden sailboat transportation cooperatives overcame the difficulties of river water drought and completed more than 8.27 million tons of transportation tasks, an increase of 12.5% ​​compared to 1955. According to preliminary statistics, compared with the same period in 1955, from June to December after the completion of cooperativization in 1956, about 80% of the members increased their income.

More than 96% of the ships in Hunan Province have participated in wooden sailboat transportation cooperatives. More than 70,700 boatmen and sailors joined the cooperatives, and 37,675 wooden sailboats joined. These wooden sailboats encountered a severe drought just after completing cooperativization, with the water level in the inland rivers dropping, and the water level in many small rivers was less than one chi (a Chinese unit of measurement equal to approximately 1/3 of a meter). The vast number of boatmen and sailors who had already been organized took measures such as digging sills and dredging beaches, and building dams to raise water, overcoming the difficulties of river water drought. For example, the three wooden sailboat transportation cooperatives of Shimen, Sangzhi, and other counties in the Lishui River system divided the 280-kilometer waterway from Sangzhi to Jinshi into sections in October last year, contracting out the dredging of 293 shoals. The average depth of the dredged sills was increased by four to eight cun (a Chinese unit of measurement equal to approximately 1/30 of a meter), which increased the carrying capacity of the ships by 15%, ensuring a steady stream of disaster relief grain was transported to the upper reaches. The turnover rate of ships has also been greatly improved during transportation. For example, the average monthly turnover of ships in the Yongxing Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative increased by four to five times compared with before cooperativization.

These organized wooden sailboats all set sail in groups, with two or three boatmen or sailors with higher skills and rich experience in each group being responsible for navigating dangerous shoals and dam openings. This has reduced accidents and improved efficiency. Due to the collective management, some ships that had not been repaired for many years were generally repaired in 1956, which greatly reduced the damage caused by moisture to transported materials.

In the past, boatmen and sailors lived on the water for a long time and lacked cultural life. Last year, they used a part of the public accumulation of the cooperatives to hold some welfare and cultural undertakings. Eight cooperatives in Linli, Changde and other places have set up semi-self-funded clinics for their members, and have also trained many health workers to work on ships. In addition, five simple boatmen's clubs have been established throughout the province, and more than 7,500 members have participated in cultural studies.

### 湖南木帆船合作化的第一年

    湖南木帆船合作化的第一年
    新华社长沙10日电　占湖南省水陆货运总量50％的木帆船，在1956年实现合作化以后，显示出了组织起来的优越性。全省六十七个木帆船运输合作社去年战胜河水枯旱的困难，完成了八百二十七万多吨运输任务，比1955年增加12.5％。据初步统计，1956年完成合作化以后的6月到12月与1955年同期比较，有80％左右的社员增加了收入。
    湖南省有96％以上的船只参加了木帆船运输合作社。入社的船民、船工七万零七百多人，入社的木帆船有三万七千六百七十五艘。这些木帆船刚刚完成合作化，就遇到严重的旱灾，内河水位下降，许多小河水位不到一市尺。已经组织起来的广大船民、船工就采取掏泓疏滩、筑坝抬水等办法，克服了河水枯旱的困难。如澧水系的石门、桑植等三个木帆船运输合作社，在去年10月间，把桑植到津市间的二百八十多公里航路，分段包干，疏通了二百九十三处浅滩，疏通地段的泓道平均掏深四寸到八寸，使船只载重量提高了15％，保证了大批救灾粮食源源运往上游。运输中，船只的周转率也大大提高了。如永兴木帆船运输合作社船只每月周转次数平均比合作化前提高四次到五次。
    这些组织起来的木帆船，都是按小组出航，每组有两、三个技术较高、经验丰富的船工或船民负责过险滩和坝口。这样就减少了事故，提高了效率。由于依靠集体经营的力量，一些多年没有修理过的船只在1956年都普遍得到修理，使运输物资受潮损失情况大大减少。
    船工、船民们过去长期居住水上，缺乏文化生活，去年他们用合作社的一部分公共积累举办了一些福利文化事业。临澧、常德等地八个合作社为社员举办了半自费的医疗所，还训练出许多保健员随船工作。此外，全省已经建立起五所简易的船民俱乐部，有七千五百多个社员已经参加文化学习。
