Xinhua News Agency, Xining -- On the grasslands of Hainan, Haibei, Huangnan, and Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures and Haixi Mongolian, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, twenty-five new sheep dip pools will be built this year, enabling 1.4 million sheep suffering from external parasitic diseases to receive treatment.

Sheep in Qinghai commonly suffer from external parasites such as mange and sheep ticks. These sheep become emaciated, and during the winter and spring seasons when grass is scarce, large numbers often die. This also affects the quality of wool and sheepskin. Treating sheep for external parasitic diseases with medicated dips is not only a simple procedure, but can usually cure the disease after only one or two dips. The two medicated dip pools that were experimentally built in the Hainan and Haibei pastoral areas last year have been welcomed by local herders.

    青海新建羊只药浴池
    据新华社西宁电　在青海省海南、海北、黄南、玉树等四个藏族自治州和海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州的草原上，今年将要新建二十五座羊只药浴池，使一百四十万只患有外寄生虫病的羊只得到治疗。
    青海羊只患疥癣、羊壁虱等外寄生虫比较普遍，这些羊只体质消瘦，在冬春缺草季节，往往容易形成大批死亡；同时也影响了羊毛、羊皮的质量。用药浴治疗羊只外寄生虫病不但手续简便，一般只要洗浴一两次后就可以治愈。去年在海南、海北牧区试建的两座药浴池，已经受到当地牧民的欢迎。
