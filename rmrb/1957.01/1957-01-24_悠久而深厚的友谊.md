A Long and Profound Friendship
Ma Hanbing, Head of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation to Afghanistan

In August 1956, when we first set foot on Afghan soil, our Afghan friends called us people who came along the "Silk Road." This short and touching remark illustrates the long and profound friendship between China and Afghanistan.

According to Chinese historical records, the friendly contact between the Chinese and Afghan peoples began as early as the pre-Christian era. At that time, Chinese geographers had already opened up the road from China to Central Asia. From that time on, Chinese silk was exported to Central Asia and even Western countries through this road. Therefore, in history, this road was called the "Silk Road." For a considerable period of time, this famous "Silk Road" was the only way for China to reach Afghanistan. On this "Silk Road," many footprints of Chinese and Afghans were left, and the friendship between the people of China and Afghanistan was recorded.

However, in the past hundred years or so, this friendly relationship between the Chinese and Afghan people was interrupted due to the interference of Western colonialism. It was only after the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially after the Bandung Conference, that the peaceful and friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Afghan people were re-established on a new basis. The mutual visits of the Chinese and Afghan cultural delegations, the holding of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition in Kabul, etc., all show that friendly relations have been re-established and developed between the two countries and their peoples on the basis of their inherent traditional friendship.

Before the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation arrived in Kabul, the Afghan Royal Government built a magnificent open-air theater for us in the Chaman area, the center of the annual Independence Day activities. After we arrived in Kabul, our hospitable hosts housed us in the most magnificent dormitory in Kabul – the Military Club. The hosts treated us with the best mutton pilaf, Afghan roast chicken, and sweet fruit juice. The Director and Deputy Director of the Press Department (equivalent to the Ministry of Culture) were with us almost every day. From visiting performance work to small living problems, they gave us great support and care, as if they were caring for their own relatives and friends.

Before we even performed, tickets for the first five shows were sold out. On the first day of the performance, although the starting time was 7:30 in the evening, the theater was full by around 6:00. Many people outside the theater who could not get tickets had to stand on the stone bridge opposite the theater or on the roofs around the theater to watch. People enjoyed each of our programs with great pleasure and joy. They believed that Chinese art maintained its unique national style, and in many places, it was very close to Afghan art. An Afghan composer, Mard, told me: "When I watched your performance, I felt like watching our own performance, and I felt particularly cordial." After each program, the applause inside and outside the theater was like a storm that lasted for a long time. Especially when we performed Afghan songs and dances, the stage and the audience often sang to each other, and the theater was filled with an atmosphere of friendly brotherhood.

Betaab, who is known as the laureate poet of Afghanistan, is over seventy years old. He lives far in the suburbs and rarely participates in social activities. However, he expressed great joy at the arrival of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation. He not only watched our performance twice in a row, but also recited his long poem "In the Chinese Theater" at the joint celebration of our delegation and the Afghan literary and art circles. This poem gave a high evaluation of Chinese art and praised the peace and friendship between the people of China and Afghanistan.

The Afghan people are very hospitable. During our twenty-eight days in Kabul, we were often invited to family banquets or tea parties by prominent people from all walks of life. An Afghan friend said: "We have the friendship of the past with you, and today we have fraternal mutual assistance and mutual support. This is the most precious friendship. That's why we would feel bad if we didn't invite you to our homes as guests."

We will never forget the meetings with Afghan King Zahir Shah and Prime Minister Daud Khan. King Zahir Shah watched our performance in his royal garden and held a grand banquet for us. At this banquet, he said: "There is a deep traditional friendship between China and Afghanistan, and many records can be found in the poetry of our two countries. Our two countries are not only neighbors, but also friendly neighbors forever." Prime Minister Daud Khan said when he met us: "Although our construction is not very good, we are willing to tell our good friends all about it and let our good friends see it for themselves."

In fact, Prime Minister Daud Khan's words were modest. During our visit, we saw the results of the hard work of the Afghan people in construction.

Once, we took a car from Kabul along the road winding through the high mountains and ridges to visit the Sorobi Hydropower Station, which is 85 kilometers away from the Afghan capital. On the way, an official from the Afghan Press Department told us: "This road was originally designed and built by an American company, but because they asked for too much money, they were not allowed to build it; later, we designed and built it ourselves." This road was indeed not easy to build. The entire road winds through the mountains, and in some places, it has to be tunneled through. However, the hardworking and intelligent Afghan people overcame all difficulties and built the road well with less money, and it was built very flat. Now, hundreds of cars travel on this road every day. The Sorobi Hydropower Station began construction five years ago. There are about 3,000 workers working here. The construction of the plant has been initially completed, and it will be able to send electricity to Kabul in February this year. In a few years, it will not only be able to supply electricity for lighting in the entire city of Kabul, but also for some light industrial factories in nearby cities.

In Kabul, we saw many new houses being built. The Broadcasting Building in front of the Press Department has been completed, and the department store building next to it is also nearing completion. When we went to visit the Mayor of Kabul, he warmly took out a blueprint of urban construction for us to see. On this blueprint, we saw the beautiful vision of the new city of Kabul.

In terms of culture and education, Afghanistan also has its own achievements. Kabul University is the highest institution of learning composed of five colleges (Medicine, Law and Politics, Literature, Science, and Theology). There are now more than 2,000 students and more than 100 professors. Among these colleges, the College of Medicine has the longest history, and the College of Science was only recently established. In Kabul, there is also a women's college equivalent to the university level, which is a school specializing in training teachers. In art, Afghanistan not only has a rich national heritage, but also many excellent new creations. Afghan song and dance have bright and healthy characteristics; they maintain a strong national style and folk flavor, and are warmly welcomed by the Afghan people and loved by us.

During our twenty-eight days in Afghanistan, we were warmly received by the Royal Government and people of Afghanistan everywhere. This beautiful and hospitable country will always remain in our memory.

    悠久而深厚的友谊
    中国赴阿富汗文化艺术代表团团长　马寒冰
    1956年8月，当我们刚踏上阿富汗领土的时候，阿富汗的朋友们把我们称为沿着“丝绸大路”来的人。这句简短而动人的话，说明了中国和阿富汗之间有着悠久而深厚的友谊。
    根据我国历史的记载，远在公元前，中国和阿富汗两个民族就开始了友好的接触。当时我国的地理学家已经开辟了从中国通往中央亚细亚的道路。从那个时候起，中国的丝绸经过这条道路输出到中央亚细亚乃至西方各国。因此，在历史上，这条道路就被称为“丝绸大路”。曾经在一个相当长的历史时期内，这条著名的“丝绸大路”一直是中国通往阿富汗的必由之道。在这条“丝绸大路”上，曾经印下了许多中国人和阿富汗人的足迹，曾经记录过中阿两国人民的友情。
    但是，近百多年来，中国和阿富汗人民之间的这种友好关系，由于西方殖民主义的干涉而中断了。只是在中华人民共和国成立、特别是在万隆会议以后，中阿两国人民之间的和平友好的交往才又在新的基础上建立起来。中国文化艺术代表团和阿富汗文化代表团的相互访问、中国商品展览会在喀布尔的举行等等，都表明了中国和阿富汗两个国家及其人民之间，已经在固有的传统友谊的基础上重新建立和发展了友好的关系。
    中国文化艺术代表团还没有抵达喀布尔的时候，阿富汗王国政府就在每年独立节的活动中心地区——查曼地区，为我们修建了一座极其壮观的露天剧场。我们抵达喀布尔以后，好客的主人把我们安置在喀布尔最华丽的宿舍——军事俱乐部里。主人们用最好的羊肉抓饭、阿富汗烤鸡和香甜的果汁，招待了我们。新闻署（相当于文化部）署长和副署长，几乎每天都同我们在一起。从访问演出工作直到细小的生活问题，他们像关心自己的亲戚朋友般地，都给予极大的支持和关怀。
    我们还没有演出，前五场的票早就销售一空。演出的头一天，开始的时间虽然是下午七时半，但在六时左右剧场内就坐满了人。剧场外面许多得不到入场券的人，只好站在剧场对面的石桥上，或者是站在剧场四周的屋顶上观看。人们怀着极大的愉快和喜悦，欣赏了我们的每个节目。他们认为中国艺术保持了自己独特的民族风格，并在许多地方和阿富汗艺术非常接近。一位阿富汗的作曲家马尔德对我说：“我看了你们的表演，就好像观看我们自己的演出一样，感到格外亲切。”每个节目演完后，剧场内外的掌声如同暴风雨般地历久不息。特别是当我们上演了阿富汗的歌曲和舞蹈时，往往是台上台下相互对唱起来，剧场上充满了友好的兄弟般的情谊的气氛。
    被誉为阿富汗桂冠诗人的贝塔布，是七十多岁的人了，他住在郊外很远的地方，平常很少参加社会活动。但是，他对于中国文化艺术代表团的到来，表示了极大的高兴。他不但连续看了我们两次演出，并在我们和阿富汗文艺界的联欢会上，朗诵了他的长诗“在中国剧院里”。这首诗对中国艺术给予极高的评价，并歌颂了中阿两国人民之间的和平与友好。
    阿富汗人民是非常好客的，我们在喀布尔滞留的二十八天中，经常应邀参加社会各界著名人士的家庭宴会或茶会。一位阿富汗朋友说：“我们和你们有着昔日的友谊，今天又兄弟般的相互帮助，相互支持，这是最值得珍贵的友谊。正因为这样，不把你们请到家里做客，心里是过意不去的。”
    我们永远不会忘记阿富汗国王查希尔·沙阿和达乌德汗首相的接见。查希尔·沙阿国王在他的御花园中，观看了我们的演出，并为我们举行了盛大宴会。在这个宴会上，他说：“中国和阿富汗之间，是有着深厚的传统友谊的，在我们两国的诗歌上，都可以见到不少的记载。我们两国之间，不但是邻国，而且永远是友好的邻国。”达乌德汗首相在接见我们时说：“虽然我们的建设还搞得不很好，但我们愿意把它的全部情况，告诉我们的好朋友，让我们的好朋友亲自去看看。”
    其实，达乌德汗首相的话是谦虚的。我们在访问期间看到了阿富汗人民辛勤建设的成果。
    有一次，我们从喀布尔乘汽车沿着盘旋在高山峻岭间的公路，前往距离阿富汗首都八十五公里的索罗比水电站参观。在途中，阿富汗新闻署的一位官员告诉我们说：“这条公路原来曾经请一家美国公司代为设计和修建，因为他们要价太高，没有让他们修建；后来是我们自己动手设计和修建起来的。”这条公路的确是不容易修的，整条道路都盘旋在山间，好些地方还得凿洞而过，但是，勤劳和智慧的阿富汗人民，克服了一切困难，以较少的资金把路修好了，而且修得十分平坦。现在每天总有上百辆汽车，奔驰在这条公路上。索罗比水电站是在五年前开始修建的，这里大约有三千多名工人在从事工作，建厂工程已经初步完成，今年2月间即能开始向喀布尔送电。几年以后，不但能够供给喀布尔全市的照明用电，还能供给附近城市的一些轻工业工厂的用电。
    在喀布尔市，我们看到了正在兴建中的许多新的房舍，新闻署前面的广播大厦已经完工，在它旁边的百货公司大楼也将近落成。当我们去拜会喀布尔市长的时候，他热情地拿出一张城市建设的蓝图给我们看，在这张蓝图上，我们看到了新的喀布尔市的美丽的远景。
    在文化教育方面，阿富汗也有了自己的成就。喀布尔大学是由五个学院（医学、法政、文学、理学、神学）组成的最高学府，现在共有二千多名学生，一百多名教授。在这些学院中以医学院的历史最久，理学院则是最近才成立的。在喀布尔，还有一个相当于大学水平的女子学院，那是专门培养师资的学校。在艺术上，阿富汗不仅拥有丰富的民族遗产，也出现了不少优秀的新创作。阿富汗歌舞具有明朗而健康的特点；它们保持着浓厚的民族风格和民间的风味，受到阿富汗人民的热烈欢迎，也为我们所喜爱。
    我们在阿富汗停留的二十八天中，到处受到阿富汗王国政府和人民的热情接待。这个美丽而好客的国家将永远留在我们的记忆里。
