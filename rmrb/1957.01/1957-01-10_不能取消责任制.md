	Responsibility System Cannot Be Cancelled
	Yang Yujin, Director of Fengman Power Plant

	Recently, under the leadership of the Party, the Party organization and administrative departments of the Fengman Power Plant have criticized and corrected the errors that occurred in the past when implementing the "one-chief system." For example, in the past, when implementing the "one-chief system," they unconsciously neglected the Party's leadership role in the enterprise and weakened political and ideological work in the enterprise. Due to the emphasis on the so-called orders of the "one chief," there were also instances of making decisions on significant issues without authorization, resulting in major accidents. At the same time, the emphasis on the orders of the "one chief" also fostered commandism and punishmentism. The principle of relying on the masses of workers to run the enterprise well was also abandoned; the plant had not convened a workers' representative assembly for almost half a year, and so on. However, we recognize that when criticizing the "one-chief system," we should distinguish between the "one-chief system" and the responsibility system. We cannot negate those positive responsibility systems while negating the "one-chief system." For example, in the past, when implementing the "one-chief system," some unreasonable organizational structures were adjusted according to the needs of production, the duties and responsibilities of various departments were established, and the scope of responsibilities for each person was defined, making it more in line with the principles of regional management and specialization. Later, the production responsibility system was fully implemented in the enterprise, ensuring that every task had a dedicated person in charge and every piece of equipment had a dedicated person to manage, thereby eliminating the chaotic phenomenon of no one being responsible in the enterprise. Today, it seems that these systems are good and should not only not be cancelled but should also be strengthened.

	Currently, some comrades criticize the "one-chief system" without considering the actual situation of the enterprise, adopting an attitude of wholesale negation. They believe that "implementing collective leadership means there is no need for a responsibility system, and there is no need to obey command and dispatch." This is wrong.

	Some comrades also believe that criticizing the "one-chief system" is the same as criticizing administrative leaders, which is incorrect. Some administrative leaders who accepted the "one-chief system" did not all do so in order to practice personal autocracy, nor did they all do so in order to place themselves above the Party organization. Because they lacked experience, they sought a leadership system for managing the enterprise and therefore unconsciously implemented the "one-chief system." In fact, some comrades, when implementing the system, also adhered to the principle of collective leadership of the Party and submitted major issues to the Party committee for collective discussion. Therefore, I believe that when criticizing the "one-chief system," we must proceed from the specific situation and not negate everything.

    不能取消责任制
    丰满发电厂厂长　杨裕进
    丰满发电厂党组织和行政部门，最近在党的领导下，批判和纠正了过去执行一长制所发生的错误。如过去在执行一长制的时候，曾经不自觉地忽视了党在企业中的领导作用，削弱了企业中的政治思想工作。由于强调所谓一长的命令，也曾发生过擅自决定重大问题，造成重大事故的情况。同时，由于强调一长的命令，也助长了命令主义和惩办主义。依靠职工群众办好企业的原则也被丢在一边了，厂里几乎半年之久没有召开职工代表大会，等等。但是，我们认识到，在批判一长制的时候，应该把一长制和责任制区别开来。不能在否定一长制的同时，也否定掉那些积极的责任制度。如过去在执行一长制的时候，曾经根据生产的需要，调整了一些不合理的组织机构，确立了各部门的职责条例，划分了各人的职责范围，使它更加符合区域管理制和专业化的原则。以后，又在企业中全面贯彻了生产责任制，使得每件工作都有专人负责，每台设备都有专人管理，从而杜绝了企业中无人负责的混乱现象。今天看来，这些制度是好的，不但不应取消，而且应该加强。
    现在，有些同志批判一长制不从企业的实际情况出发，采取一概否定的态度。认为“实行集体领导，就可以不要责任制了，就可以不必服从指挥和调度了”。这是错误的。
    还有些同志认为批判一长制，就是批判行政负责人，这是不对的。有些行政负责人接受一长制，并不都是为了要实行个人独断独行，也不都是为了要把自己放在党组织之上。他们因为缺少经验，寻求一种管理企业的领导制度，因而不自觉地执行了一长制。事实上，有些同志在执行的时候，遇有重大事情也是坚持了党的集体领导的原则，交给党委集体讨论的。因此，我认为，在批判一长制的时候，要从具体情况出发，不要否定一切。
