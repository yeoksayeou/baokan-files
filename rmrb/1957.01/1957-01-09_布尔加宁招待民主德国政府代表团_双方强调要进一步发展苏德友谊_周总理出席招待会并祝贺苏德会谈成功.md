Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th - TASS reports: Soviet Minister of Council Chairman Bulganin held a reception at the Grand Kremlin Palace on the 7th to host the delegation from the German Democratic Republic (GDR) government, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl.

Guests included Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China; Vice Premier He Long; and Wang Jiaxiang and Liu Xiao, members of the Chinese government delegation.

The Soviet side attending the reception included: Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Saburov, Suslov, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Shepilov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Aristov, Belyayev, Pospelov, heads of departments of the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, scientists and cultural workers, artists, and Soviet and foreign newspaper reporters.

Also attending the reception were diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union.

At the meeting, Bulganin told the guests that the results of the negotiations between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic would help to further consolidate the fraternal friendship between the two countries and further unite the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism. Bulganin emphasized that the Soviet Union would always be a loyal and reliable friend of the working people of the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union will continue to carry out extensive political, economic, and cultural cooperation with the German Democratic Republic in the future, thereby promoting and consolidating peace and improving the material welfare of the peoples of both countries.

Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, then spoke. He expressed satisfaction that the government delegation had the opportunity to exchange views extensively with the Soviet government in Moscow. He stressed that the German Democratic Republic government believes that the issues of disarmament and guaranteeing European security are of particular significance. He said on behalf of the majority of the working people of Germany that the revival of West German militarism should be stopped to ensure the peaceful future of Germany and the peaceful cooperation of the German people with the peoples of other countries. Grotewohl said that the fact that we maintain close and friendly relations with the Soviet Union, a socialist power of peace, assures us that we will be able to successfully solve the complex and arduous tasks we face, both in resolving the major issues of the German national struggle and in building socialism.

Next, the First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ulbricht, spoke. He pointed out that the negotiations between the two governments and the recent meeting in Budapest have shown the working class and all peace-loving people in all countries that the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are growing stronger, and as long as we fight together with all our strength, the prospect of peace is a realistic prospect.

The Vice-Chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic followed with speeches: Nuschke, Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union; Bolz, Chairman of the National Democratic Party; Loch, Chairman of the Free Democratic Party; and Scholz, Deputy Chairman of the German Democratic Peasants' Party.

When talking about the Hungarian events, Nuschke emphasized that the Soviet Union's position on the Hungarian events and its warning to the aggressors who launched the criminal invasion of Egypt had twice saved peace.

Bolz pointed out that the middle class of Democratic Germany has just been proven once again that the reliable pillars of the people's freedom, national sovereignty, and peaceful life of citizens are the unity of the socialist camp, its strengthening, and the strengthening of its leading force—the Soviet Union. The progressive forces of the German people, including the middle class of Democratic Germany, are determined to crush any attempt to launch an attack on peace, socialism, and the people's democratic system.

Loch said that representatives of the vast majority of the bourgeoisie in the German Democratic Republic firmly support the German Democratic Republic—the first peace-loving and progressive country in German history. Restoring German unity must become a matter for all Germans who love their motherland and love peace, because only when the will of all Germans who are loyal to their motherland to demand the restoration of unity is brought together will there be enough power to overcome negative and reactionary factors. This struggle will be difficult, but the German people will surely win the victory of the struggle.

Scholz said that the beginning of 1957 could not be happier for the working people of the German Democratic Republic, because it marks the further development of lasting and consolidated friendship with the great Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union took a firm stand to put out the torches of war ignited by imperialism in Hungary and Egypt, our villages breathed a sigh of relief. Our people will join the peoples of all countries in the great socialist camp to guarantee peace and the democratic development of all of Germany.

At the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai and the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, the head of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, Prime Minister Grotewohl, and the delegation members raised their glasses to congratulate the success of the talks between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, and wished each other good health.

Premier Zhou Enlai also went around and conversed and toasted with the diplomatic envoys of various countries attending the reception.

The reception was held in a very sincere and friendly atmosphere. An artistic performance was held after the meeting.

    布尔加宁招待民主德国政府代表团
    双方强调要进一步发展苏德友谊
    周总理出席招待会并祝贺苏德会谈成功
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁7日在大克里姆林宫举行招待会，招待以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团。
    来宾中有中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来，副总理贺龙和中国政府代表团团员王稼祥和刘晓。
    苏联方面出席招待会的有：伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、萨布洛夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、勃列日?夫、谢皮洛夫、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克、阿里斯托夫、别利亚耶夫、波斯伯洛夫，苏联最高苏维埃和部长会议各部门的负责人，科学和文化工作者、艺术家以及苏联和外国报纸的记者。
    出席招待会的还有各国驻苏联外交使节。
    会上，布尔加宁对客人们说，苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表团谈判的成果有助于两国间兄弟友谊的更加巩固，有助于和平、民主和社会主义阵营力量的进一步团结。布尔加宁强调说，苏联永远是德意志民主共和国劳动人民的忠实可靠的朋友。苏联今后仍将同德意志民主共和国进行广泛的政治、经济和文化合作，从而促进、巩固和平和提高两国人民物质福利的事业。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥接着讲话。他对政府代表团有机会在莫斯科同苏联政府广泛地交换意见表示满意。他着重指出，德意志民主共和国政府认为裁军问题和保证欧洲安全问题具有特殊的意义。他代表德国大多数劳动人民说，应当制止西德军国主义复活，以保证德国的和平未来和德国人民同其他国家人民的和平合作。格罗提渥说，我们同苏联这个社会主义和平大国保持亲密友好联系的事实，使我们确信，无论是在解决德国民族斗争的重大问题方面或是在建设社会主义方面，我们将能胜利地解决我们所面临的复杂而艰巨的任务。
    接着，德意志民主共和国第一副总理、德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希讲话。他指出，两国政府的谈判以及最近在布达佩斯举行的会议向各国工人阶级和全体爱好和平的人们表明，和平、民主和社会主义的力量日益壮大，只要我们共同地全力进行斗争，和平的前景就是现实的前景。
    德意志民主共和国部长会议各位副主席：基督教民主联盟主席努舍克、国家民主党主席博尔茨、自由民主党主席洛赫、德国民主农民党副主席绍尔茨相继在招待会上讲话。
    努舍克在谈到匈牙利事件时着重指出，苏联对匈牙利事件所采取的立场和它对向埃及发动罪恶侵犯的侵略者的警告两次拯救了和平。
    博尔茨指出，民主德国的中产阶层刚刚再次得到证明：人民的自由、国家的主权和公民的和平生活的可靠支柱是社会主义阵营的团结一致，是它的加强以及它的主导力量——苏联的加强。德国人民的进步力量，包括民主德国的中产阶层决心要粉碎任何想对和平、社会主义和人民民主制度发动进攻的企图。
    洛赫说，民主德国绝大多数资产者阶层的代表坚决支持德意志民主共和国——德国历史上的第一个爱好和平和进步的国家。恢复德国统一必须成为所有热爱自己的祖国、热爱和平的德国人的事情，因为只有所有忠实于祖国的德国人要求恢复统一的意志汇合在一起，才会有足够的力量去战胜消极的和反动的因素。这场斗争将是困难的，但是德国人民一定会取得斗争的胜利。
    绍尔茨说，1957年的开始对于民主德国的劳动人民来说是再幸福不过了，因为它标志着同伟大苏联持久和巩固的友谊的进一步发展。当苏联采取了坚定的立场打掉帝国主义在匈牙利和埃及燃起来的战争火把的时候，我们的村庄松了一口气。我国人民将同伟大的社会主义阵营各国人民一起保障和平和全德国的民主发展。
    在招待会上，周恩来总理同苏联共产党和政府的领导人、德意志民主共和国政府代表团团长格罗提渥总理和团员们互相举杯，祝贺苏联和德意志民主共和国两国会谈的成功，并且互相祝贺健康。
    周恩来总理还绕场同参加招待会的各国外交使节交谈和干杯。
    招待会在非常诚恳和友好的气氛中进行，会后举行了艺术表演。
