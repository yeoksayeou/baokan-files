Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd. Workers at the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory and members of the Liujiangtun Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang have frequent interactions throughout the year, and have established a deep friendship.

During the hoeing season this year, the Liujiangtun Agricultural Production Cooperative, due to lack of experience and poor labor allocation, was quickly overcome by weeds that obscured the seedlings. Just as the cooperative members were getting anxious, the workers from the Air Compressor Factory came during their work breaks and quickly helped the farmers to clear all the weeds.

The cooperative bought rice milling machines, flour milling machines, and diesel engines, but encountered difficulties during installation: the concrete foundation developed cracks. Upon hearing about this, the workers at the Air Compressor Factory immediately sent technician Zhang Zhenhai to help. Soon, these machines were up and running.

In the second quarter of last year, the workers at the Air Compressor Factory also used scrap materials to make a set of farm tool repair tools and gave them to the farmers. In the fourth quarter, they helped the cooperative train two agricultural workers.

The farmers of the Liujiangtun Agricultural Production Cooperative also did their best to support the factory last year. In the second half of the year, when the city's vegetable supply was insufficient, the cooperative members drove carts loaded with large quantities of potatoes, radishes, and other vegetables into the city, providing them to the workers and families of the Air Compressor Factory at low prices. The factory needed to build a batch of houses for its workers, and the workers' spare-time school needed to add a batch of desks and chairs, but at the time, they could not find carpenters or tilers. The cooperative then sent carpenters and tilers, who meticulously helped the factory to make them.

Over the past year, the two sides have also strengthened their friendship through activities such as correspondence, ball games, film evenings, and book donations. Currently, both sides are rehearsing cultural programs, preparing for a warm gathering during the Spring Festival.

    工农之间
    新华社沈阳22日电　沈阳空气压缩机厂职工和沈阳市郊柳匠屯农业生产合作社社员们，一年四季都有来往；双方已经建立了深厚的友谊。
    今年夏锄季节，柳匠屯农业生产合作社由于经验不足，劳动力调配不开，杂草很快遮住了小苗。社员们正在着急的时候，空气压缩机厂的工人们趁着工休的机会来到了，很快地帮助农民把草拔光了。
    合作社买来了磨米机、磨面机、柴油机，在安装的时候碰到了困难：用混凝土打的地基裂缝。空气压缩机厂职工听到了这件事，马上派技师张振海前来帮助，不久，这些机器很快地转动了起来。
    空气压缩机厂的工人们在去年第二季度，还用废料做了一套修理农具的工具，送给了农民；第四季度又帮助合作社培养了两名农业工人。
    柳匠屯农业生产合作社的农民们，在去年也尽了自己的力量支援工厂。下半年城市蔬菜供应不足，社员们赶着大车，把大量的土豆、萝卜等菜蔬送进城，廉价供给了空气压缩机厂的职工和家属。工厂要给职工修建一批住宅，工人业余学校要增添一批桌椅，可是当时寻不到木、瓦工，合作社就派来了木工和瓦工，精雕细作地帮助工厂做出来了。
    一年来，双方还通过通信、赛球、电影晚会、赠书等活动加强了相互间的友谊。目前，两方都在排练文娱节目，准备在春节期间来一次热烈的欢聚。
