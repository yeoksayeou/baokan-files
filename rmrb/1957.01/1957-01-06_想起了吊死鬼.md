Title: Thoughts on the Hanging Ghost

    I remembered the story of the hanging ghost tricking the living into hanging themselves when I was little. It is said that the hanging ghost roams the world, trying to find a substitute by stirring up relationships between relatives and creating discord. When people quarrel, it takes the opportunity to entangle them. Hidden in the shadows, it claps its hands and sings to the sad person: "It's good to die, it's good to die, when you die, you don't have to wear ragged cotton clothes." At the same time, it lowers a rope from the roof beam, with a slipknot at the end, swinging it back and forth in front of the person. In a trance, the person is involuntarily pushed by the hanging ghost towards the noose and sticks their head in it. Only when the rope tightens around the neck does the person realize that they have fallen for the hanging ghost's trick, but it is too late. The hanging ghost then laughs and jumps wildly, lunging forward to tighten the noose until the hanged person is completely out of breath. While relatives and friends surround the body and weep, the hanging ghost, hiding in a dark corner, will openly and contentedly celebrate its victory.

    However, the hanging ghost often fails. It is said that the hanging ghost is most afraid of people's relatives and friends. When relatives and friends arrive, the heartbroken person will wake up, and the hanging ghost can only let out a gloomy howl in helplessness...

    This story made a deep impression on me at the time. It made my hair stand on end when I thought about it, but after childhood, my courage grew, and the impression no longer stayed in my mind. Recently, after reading a news item in the newspaper, I thought of the hanging ghost again. The news said that the Hungarian fascist leader Horthy, who fled to Lisbon, Portugal, still wants to make a comeback and issued a statement saying that he is willing to do his part for Hungary.

    This association is not absurd. The Hungarian people have just experienced a thrilling event. They woke up when their necks were tightened. They knew that they had to break free from this trap at this critical moment and urgently needed the assistance of their relatives. The relatives guarding the Hungarian people cannot stand idly by and watch their brothers and sisters die. But we also heard the miserable and furious howl of the defeated hanging ghost...

    The hanging ghost is helpless against those who are clear-headed. But we must be vigilant!

    想起了吊死鬼
    侠人
    小时候听过吊死鬼诱骗活人上吊的故事。据说吊死鬼游荡人间，为了找替身，到处挑拨亲人们的关系，制造不和，待到人们发生了吵闹，它便趁机上前去缠绕。它隐蔽在暗处，向着伤心的人拍手唱道：“死了好，死了好，死了不穿破棉袄。”同时便从屋梁间放下一条绳子来，绳头有一个打活结的套子，在人面前摆过来摆过去。人便在精神恍惚中不由自主地被吊死鬼推向绳结，钻进套子。只在绳子勒着了脖子的时候，人才清醒地知道是上了吊死鬼的当，但已经迟了。吊死鬼便狂笑狂跳着扑向前去，勒紧绳套，直到被吊的人完全气绝。在亲友们围尸痛哭的当儿，躲在阴暗角落里的吊死鬼就会公然心满意足地庆贺自己的胜利。
    但是吊死鬼常常要失败的。据说吊死鬼最怕人的亲友，亲友一来，伤心的人便会清醒过来，吊死鬼就只能在无可奈何中发出阴气逼人的嚎叫……。
    这故事当时给我的印象很深，一想起来，便毛骨悚然，但一过童年，胆子大了，那印象也不再留在脑子里了。最近看了报上的一则消息，我又想起吊死鬼来。这则消息说：逃亡到葡萄牙里斯本的匈牙利法西斯头子霍尔蒂还想卷土重来，发表声明说，愿为匈牙利出一把力云云。
    这个联想并不是无稽的。匈牙利人民刚刚经历过一场惊险，他们在被勒紧了脖子的时候惊醒过来，他们知道必须在这千钧一发的时刻挣脱这圈套，急切地需要亲人们的援助。守卫在匈牙利人民周围的亲人们，自然就不能眼看着自己的兄弟遇难而不救。但是，我们也听到了失败了的吊死鬼惨厉、暴怒的嚎叫……
    吊死鬼对于神志清醒的人是一筹莫展的。但是，我们要警惕！
