Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th – Egypt is vigorously repairing the railway and the parallel highway that traverse the Sinai Peninsula. These two transportation lines along the Mediterranean coast are the main transportation arteries on the Sinai Peninsula. The Israeli army thoroughly destroyed both the railway and the highway during their retreat.

An Egyptian officer told a group of foreign and Egyptian journalists who recently visited the Sinai Peninsula that sixty-seven kilometers of the railway have been repaired. The restoration of the highway is also being accelerated. As the journalists traveled east, they saw many workers laying asphalt on the highway and erecting telephone lines. The foundation of a new railway station has been laid next to the old ruins. Housing and public buildings are also under construction.

This group of foreign and Egyptian journalists arrived in Romani on the 6th via the newly repaired desert railway. They witnessed firsthand some of the atrocities committed by Israel in the Sinai Peninsula.

Romani, according to the map, is located about fifteen kilometers east of the Suez Canal. All the buildings and water towers of this desert station were bombed. Everywhere there were charred beds, household appliances, and torn copies of the Quran. A dozen damaged railway cars leaned against one side of the station.

Many Egyptian prisoners of war were killed inside when the Israeli army destroyed the station before their retreat. Journalists could still see many severed limbs, bones, and bloodstains in the rubble. An Egyptian officer said that about thirty-eight bodies have been found so far. In addition to soldiers, the remains of a woman and a child in her arms were found in the ruins.

An Arab worker who survived the disaster said that these prisoners of war were forced by the Israelis to dismantle the railway tracks and utility poles before they were killed. The Israeli army told them to go into the station to get food, at which point the building exploded.

During the forty-two-kilometer journey, journalists saw collapsed water towers, overturned signal poles, and former railway stations reduced to piles of rubble—all evidence of the large-scale destruction by the Israeli army.

### 劫后西奈半岛满目疮痍  埃及大力进行修复工作

    劫后西奈半岛满目疮痍
    埃及大力进行修复工作
    新华社开罗7日电　埃及正在大力修复横贯西奈半岛的铁路和同这条铁路平行的公路。这两条沿地中海岸的交通线是西奈半岛上的主要交通干线，以色列军队在撤退时对铁路和公路都进行了彻底的破坏。
    一位埃及军官对最近到西奈半岛访问的一批外国和埃及记者说，铁路已经修复了六十七公里。公路的修复工作也正在加速进行。记者们一路东行的时候，看到许多工人在公路上铺柏油和架设电话线。新火车站的基础已经在旧的废墟旁边奠立。住宅和公用房屋也正在建筑中。
    这一批外国和埃及的记者沿着新修复的沙漠铁路在6日到达罗曼尼，他们亲眼看到了以色列在西奈半岛所犯的暴行的某些片断。
    罗曼尼从地图上看，是在苏伊士运河以东大约十五公里的地方。这个沙漠车站的所有的建筑和水塔都被炸光。到处都是烧焦的床、家庭用具和撕碎的古兰经。十几辆炸坏了的铁路车辆靠在车站的一边。
    在以色列军队撤退前炸毁车站的时候，许多埃及战俘被炸死在里边。记者们仍然可以在瓦砾堆里看到许多断肢、骨头和血迹。一位埃及军官说，到现在为止，大约找到了三十八具尸体。除了军人以外，还在废墟中找到了一个妇女和抱在她怀里的一个小孩的尸体。
    一位幸免于难的阿拉伯工人说，这些战俘在被杀之前曾经被以色列人强迫去拆除铁轨和电杆。以色列军队叫他们进站去弄食物，这时候房屋爆炸了。
    在四十二公里旅行的沿途中，记者们看到了倒塌的水塔、被掀翻的信号杆、过去的火车站已经成为一堆堆的废墟——这些都是以色列军队大肆破坏的证据。
