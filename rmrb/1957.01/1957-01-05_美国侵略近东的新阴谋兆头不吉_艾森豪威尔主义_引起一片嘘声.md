Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Amman on January 3rd, Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi met with the U.S. Ambassador to Jordan on January 3rd. Nabulsi informed the U.S. government through him that Jordan opposes the U.S. attempt to monopolize the new military and economic plan in the Middle East.
The dispatch stated that the U.S. government's policy towards the Middle East was the target of fierce criticism by members of the lower house of the Jordanian parliament on the evening of January 2nd.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Damascus Dispatch: Jabri, Chairman of the Syrian Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, said on January 3rd that President Eisenhower's plan to request the authority to use U.S. troops in the Middle East whenever necessary is a conspiracy concocted by imperialists.
In a statement, Jabri accused: "Israel's aim is clearly to expand the part of Palestine it currently occupies." He said: "This constitutes a direct threat to our country." He then accused the United States of "failing to return the Arabs to their own country, and also failing to prevent Israel from carrying out repeated acts of aggression that ultimately manifested themselves in the recent conspiracy of the three countries against Egypt."
He said: Despite these circumstances, "the United States has not given us weapons for self-defense, and if we obtain unconditional assistance from the Soviet Union, the United States does not agree."
Jabri said: "We are not communists, nor do we want to become Westerners. We are prepared to cooperate with any small or large country that supports our cause in Palestine, Algeria, and Egypt without imposing conditions that undermine our sovereignty and independence." Jabri said, "We will not forget the benefits the Soviet Union has given us."

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Cairo Dispatch: Khaled Mohieddin, editor of the Egyptian newspaper "Al Misaa," published an article in the newspaper on January 3rd, accusing the United States of planning a new expansion in the Middle East.
He pointed out that President Eisenhower's proposed measures to use troops in the Middle East when necessary should have been taken when Britain and France invaded Egypt. He said: "At that time, all the United States did was ask its citizens to leave Egypt and the Middle East."
Mohieddin asked: "Then why didn't Eisenhower immediately ask for authorization to use U.S. troops in the Middle East after Israel launched its aggression, or after Britain and France issued their ultimatum to Egypt, or even after Britain and France invaded Port Said?"
Mohieddin also asked: "Since the fighting has ended and the United States clearly knows who the aggressor is in the Middle East, then why take this measure?"
Mohieddin also pointed out: "The United Nations and the Security Council still exist and possess all their powers."

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, TASS, New York, January 3rd: The "New York American Journal" published a dispatch from its Cairo correspondent, Wiegand, reporting on the reaction of Arab countries to the American plan to strengthen American colonial rule in the Near East - the "Eisenhower Doctrine" widely rumored in American newspapers. The reporter pointed out that the governments and people of Arab countries believe that the purpose of the U.S. Middle East policy is a "new intervention, a new foreign rule."
Wiegand wrote that it should be remembered that "no region in the world is as vigilant and distrustful as the Near East when people mention foreign troops." Referring to the U.S. plan to expand the Baghdad Pact, Wiegand wrote, "From Cairo to Damascus, from Amman to Beirut, astute observers agree that Washington's attempt to turn the Baghdad Pact into the basis of a new U.S. policy in the Near East is doomed to failure."

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: French newspapers continue to comment on the U.S. plan to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries.
"La Tribune des Nations" said that Washington's current approach is "deliberately provoking" the "danger" of war in the region. It believes that the U.S. plan will never eliminate the "powder keg" of the Near East.
"Combat" pointed out that the United States "underestimated" the "extensive reservations and objections" that the plan could provoke.
"Libération," when discussing the purpose of U.S. policy, emphasized that the U.S. ruling clique is trying to consolidate its position in Arab countries.
"L'Humanité" pointed out that the U.S. plan is to seize the positions of British and French imperialists in the Near East and deprive the Arab people of their sovereignty. "L'Humanité" wrote, "The crazy Suez adventure and the failure of the 'pacification' policy in Algeria prepared the ground for the offensive of American imperialism."

    美国侵略近东的新阴谋兆头不吉
    “艾森豪威尔主义”引起一片嘘声
    新华社4日讯　据路透社安曼3日消息，约旦首相纳布西3日接见了美国驻约旦大使。纳布西通过他通知美国政府说，约旦反对美国企图垄断中东的新军事经济计划。
    消息说，美国政府对中东的政策是2日晚上约旦议会下院议员猛烈抨击的目标。
    新华社4日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚议会外交委员会主席贾布里1月3日说，艾森豪威尔总统要求在必需时随时可以在中东使用美国军队的权力的计划是帝国主义者所搞起来的一个阴谋。
    贾布里在一项声明中指责说：“以色列的目的显然是要扩大它现在所占的那一部分巴勒斯坦”。他说：“这就构成了对我们国家的一种直接威胁。”他接着指责说，美国“未能使阿拉伯人回到自己的国家去，并且也未能防止以色列实现最后表现为最近三国对埃及的阴谋的历次的侵略行为”。
    他说：尽管有这些情况，“美国却并没有给我们武器来进行自卫，而如果我们从苏联方面获得无条件的援助，美国也不同意。”
    贾布里说：“我们并不是共产党人，我们也不要成为西方人。任何一个小国或大国只要支持我们在巴勒斯坦、阿尔及利亚和埃及的事业而不提出破坏我国主权和独立的条件，我们都准备同它合作。”贾布里说：“我们将不会忘记苏联所给予我们的好处”。
    据新华社4日讯　开罗消息：埃及“晚报”编辑哈立德·毛希丁3日在这家报纸上发表文章，指责美国正在策划中的在中东进行新的扩张的计划。
    他指出，艾森豪威尔总统提出的必要时在中东使用军队的措施应该在英法侵略埃及的时候采取才对。他说：“当时美国所做的仅仅是要求它的国民离开埃及和中东。”
    毛希丁问道：“那末为什么在以色列发动侵略以后或者在英法向埃及发出最后通牒以后或者甚至在英法侵略塞得港以后，艾森豪威尔不马上要求授权在中东使用美国军队呢？”
    毛希丁还问道：“既然战斗已经结束，美国显然知道在中东谁是侵略者。那末，为什么要采取这个措施呢？”
    毛希丁还指出：“联合国和安全理事会仍旧存在，并且拥有它们的全部权力。”
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社纽约3日讯：“纽约美国人日报”发表了该报驻开罗记者维根德的一篇通讯，通讯报道了阿拉伯国家对美国所策划的加强美国在近东的殖民统治的计划美国报纸盛传的“艾森豪威尔主义”的反应。记者指出，阿拉伯国家的政府和人民认为美国的中东政策的目的是一种“新的干涉，新的外国统治。”
    维根德写道，应当记住，“当人们一提到外国军队的时候，世界上没有任何一个地区像近东这样的警惕和抱着不信任的态度。”维根德在谈到美国扩大巴格达条约计划的时候写道，“从开罗到大马士革，从安曼到贝鲁特，有头脑的观察家一致认为：华盛顿企图将巴格达条约变为美国在近东的新的政策的基础，这种企图注定是要失败的。”
    据新华社4日讯　法国报纸继续评论美国干涉中东国家内政的计划。
    “义勇军报”说，华盛顿现在的做法是“故意冒犯”在这个地区发生战争的“危险”。它认为美国的计划绝不会消灭近东的“火药库”。
    “战斗报”指出：美国“低估了”这个计划所能招致的“广泛的保留和反对意见”。
    “解放报”谈到美国政策的目的时着重指出，美国统治集团力图在阿拉伯国家中巩固自己的地位。
    “人道报”指出，美国的计划是想夺取英国和法国帝国主义者在近东的地位和剥夺阿拉伯国家人民的主权。“人道报”写道，“疯狂的苏伊士冒险以及对阿尔及利亚的‘绥靖’政策的失败，为美国帝国主义的进攻准备了基础。”
