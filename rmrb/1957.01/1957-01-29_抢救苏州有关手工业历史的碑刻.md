    Rescuing Stone Inscriptions Related to the History of Suzhou's Handicraft Industry
    Commentator of This Newspaper

    Recently, a reporter returning from Suzhou mentioned that Suzhou has a batch of stone inscriptions related to the history of the handicraft industry, which have been neglected for a long time, resulting in significant losses, and urgently need to be rescued. This situation deserves attention. The Jiangsu Provincial Museum Preparatory Office has now begun to sort out and preserve these stone inscriptions. We hope that other relevant departments will support them and rescue all the stone inscriptions related to Suzhou's handicraft industry without omission.

    Suzhou was a city with a very developed handicraft industry in the past. All handicraft industries had their own guilds. Some guilds were even divided into those of owners and those of craftsmen. They erected many stone tablets with official documents and announcements in their guild halls, public offices, and temples, estimated to be nearly two hundred. Some of them explain the exclusion of individual owners who do not abide by the rules of the industry by a group of owners; others explain the struggle between the owners and the craftsmen's guilds. For example, the "Stele Recording the Perpetual Prohibition of Machine Weavers from Calling a Strike by Various Constitutional Authorities," published in the "Cultural Relics Reference Materials" in the seventh issue of 1956, is one of them. In the past, few people paid attention to preserving these stone tablets. The friends in charge of managing cultural relics were mainly interested in antiques. For them, the more ancient the cultural relics, the better, and most of these stone tablets were from the Qing Dynasty, so they did not receive their attention. As for others who are not very interested in any cultural relics, they certainly pay even less attention. As a result, many stone tablets have been broken up to repair roads or used as cornerstones.

    However, this batch of stone tablets has great historical value. According to the preliminary investigation by friends from the Jiangsu Provincial Museum Preparatory Office, part of the situation of these inscriptions is as follows:

    1.  In the toilet of the "Shangjin Residents Committee" at the Guangji Bridge outside Changmen, seven stone tablets were used as urinal seats. Among them, the inscription erected for cloth merchants in a certain month of the thirty-second year of Kangxi (1693) contains the words "On the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month of the thirty-first year of Kangxi (1692)... Luo Gui and others incited and collectively increased prices, resulting in gathering crowds to beat and rob, and destroying official notices, which was extremely ferocious and violated the law..." Another example is the inscription erected in the seventh month of the fifty-ninth year of Kangxi (1720) for 43 cloth merchant heads, 13 Fang heads of Wu and Liang counties, and 19 Jia heads, which contains the words "Weavers enter the Fang, four weavers guarantee each other; ...Fearing crime, or hanging themselves by throwing themselves into the river... The labor cost is one point, one li and two hao per bolt, the rice price is one tael and five qian, and two qian and four fen of silver are added per thousand bolts..." There is also an inscription erected in the intercalary ninth month of the twenty-first year of Qianlong (1756) for 34 Fang owners of Changyuan, Wu and San counties, titled "Stele of the Strict Prohibition by Various Constitutional Authorities of Paper Mill Craftsmen from Holding and Forcibly Increasing Labor Prices," etc., all of which are inscriptions with important content. In the courtyard at No. 197 Shangtang Street, Guangji Bridge, there are also four stone tablets, with the faces of the tablets built into the wall; in addition, there are two broken pieces, one lying face down on the ground.

    2.  Taihe Public Office (Chinese herbal medicine industry public office), in front of the Old School, has a stele inscription.

    3.  Qixiang Public Office (silk and satin public office), in Wenya Lane, when the former Suzhou Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce was working inside, eighteen broken steles were scattered and stacked in the open air at the entrance. The public office is now borrowed by the Jiangsu Provincial Su Kun Opera Troupe.

    4.  Yunjin Public Office (cloud brocade public office), in Xiangfu Temple Lane, has seven stele inscriptions.

    5.  Xia Zhang Public Office, in Qiao Sikong Lane, has a stele inscription.

    6.  Jinwen Public Office (Gu Embroidery Public Office), in Zhongshi Xiatang, has eight stele inscriptions of various sizes.

    7.  Xuanyuan Palace, in Xiangfu Temple Lane, has two stele inscriptions.

    8.  Sanguan Temple, in Xuanmiao Temple, has a stele inscription from the Suzhou Weaving Office in February of the sixth year of Qianlong (1741), originally in the North Bureau, later moved here temporarily, the stele is broken into two pieces.

    The above investigation is extremely incomplete. But even from these fragments, it can be seen that there are still many historical materials related to the handicraft industry in Suzhou that have not been unearthed. These historical materials will inevitably arouse the great interest of many scholars, because they are direct related documents left by the handicraft industry itself, and there is nothing more sufficient to explain the historical situation of the development of the handicraft industry.

    There are still many other stone inscriptions existing in Suzhou, and their fate is the same as the above-mentioned stone inscriptions of the handicraft industry. For example, the Liyuan Public Office (in front of Zhenfu Division) stores 25 stele inscriptions of various sizes from the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. Except for those built into the wall that are relatively complete, they are all broken horizontally in the courtyard.

    The abandonment of these materials is very regrettable. The relevant agencies of Jiangsu Province and Suzhou City should cooperate with experts from the history departments of local universities and colleges to take active and effective measures to rescue all these stone inscriptions that are constantly being destroyed, no matter what era they belong to, and strive to preserve them. This work is meaningful and not difficult to complete. It is hoped that the local leading organs can also actively give support.

    抢救苏州有关手工业历史的碑刻
    本报评论员
    最近有一位记者由苏州回来，谈到苏州有一批关于手工业历史的碑刻，长期无人过问，损失很大，亟需抢救的情形。这种情况值得引起注意。江苏省博物馆筹备处现在已经对这些碑刻开始加以整理和保存。我们希望其他有关部门给他们以支持，把苏州的有关手工业的全部碑刻无遗漏地都抢救出来。
    苏州过去是手工业很发达的城市。所有手工业都有自己的行会。有的行会还分为老板的和工匠的。它们在会馆里面、公所里面、寺观里面立了许多刻着公文和告示的石碑，估计数量约近二百块。其中有的是说明一群老板排斥个别不守行规的老板的；有的是说明老板同工匠行会的斗争的。例如发表在“文物参考资料”1956年第七期的“奉各宪永禁机匠叫歇碑记”就是其中之一。过去很少人注意保存这些石碑。负责管理文物的朋友们的兴趣主要在古物上面。对于他们，文物总是越古越好，而这些石碑绝大多数都是清朝的，所以得不到他们的重视。至于其他对任何文物都不会有多大兴趣的人当然更加不重视。结果，有不少石碑已被打碎去修路或者当做基石了。
    但是，这一批石碑是有很大历史价值的。据江苏省博物馆筹备处的朋友们初步的调查，这些碑刻的一部分情况如下：
    一、在阊门外广济桥堍“上津居民委员会”厕所里面有七块石碑被当作尿桶座。其中如康熙三十二年×月为布商立的碑文中有“康熙三十一年八月二十九日……罗贵等煽惑齐行增价，以致聚众殴抢，复毁官示，种种凶横，殊干法纪，……”等语。又如康熙五十九年七月为布商四十三家长吴两县坊总十三人甲长十九人立的，碑文中有“踹匠进坊，四匠互保；……畏罪或有投河自刎自缢……工价每匹一分一厘二毫，米价一两五钱，每千匹加银二钱四分……”等语。还有乾隆二十一年闰九月为长元吴三县坊主三十四家立的碑文题为“奉各宪严禁纸坊工匠把持勒增工价永遵碑”等，都是有重要内容的碑刻。在广济桥上塘街一百九十七号院内还有四块石碑，碑面砌入墙内；另有二块断残，一块合扑地上。
    二、太和公所（药材业公所），在旧学前，有碑记一块。
    三、七襄公所（纱缎公所），在文衙弄，前苏州市工商五联在内办公的时候，把断碑十八块散叠在进门处露天地上，现该公所由江苏省苏昆剧团借用。
    四、云锦公所，在祥符寺巷内，有碑记七块。
    五、霞章公所，在乔司空巷，有碑记一块。
    六、锦文公所（顾绣公所），在中市下塘，有碑记大小八块。
    七、轩辕宫，在祥符寺巷内，有碑记二块。
    八、三官殿，在玄妙观内，有乾隆六年二月苏州织造碑记一块，原在北局，后移此暂置，碑断为二。
    以上调查是极不完全的。但是即使从这些片断里面也可以看出，在苏州还有许多有关手工业的历史材料没有发掘出来。这些历史材料必然会引起许多学者的重大兴趣，因为它是手工业本身遗留下来的直接有关的文献，没有比它更足以说明手工业发展的历史状况的了。
    苏州现存的其他碑刻还有很多，它们的命运也正与上述手工业的碑刻相同。例如，梨园公所（在镇抚司前）就存有乾隆、嘉庆时代的碑刻大小二十五块，除砌在墙里的比较完整以外，都被横断在院子里面。
    这些材料的弃置是很令人惋惜的。江苏省和苏州市的有关机关应当同当地高等学校历史系的专家合作，采取积极的有效的办法，抢救所有这些不断遭到破坏的碑刻，不论它们是属于什么时代的，都应该力求加以保存。这个工作是有意义的，也是不难完成的，希望当地领导机关也能积极给以支持。
