Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 9th: A paper-making machine that Li Hongzhang bought from abroad sixty-six years ago now produces three and a half times more paper per day than it did in its youth.

This machine is still in the factory building of China's oldest paper mill, the Tianzhang Paper Mill. The predecessor of the Tianzhang Mill was the "Lunzhang Paper Bureau" founded by Li Hongzhang.

When this machine was shipped to Shanghai, there was no power plant in Shanghai at that time. The machine was driven by a steam engine and could only produce two tons of paper per day. Now, many of the hexagonal screw caps on this machine have been worn smooth, and the English trademark cast on the drying cylinder has become blurred and difficult to identify. Such an old machine should have been returned to the furnace as scrap iron long ago. However, it now produces nine tons of paper per day, the highest record in sixty-six years.

After the joint venture two years ago, the workers of the Tianzhang Mill took great care of this machine. The workers said that if needed, we are prepared to use it for another forty or fifty years.

    机器返老还童
    据新华社上海9日电　六十六年前李鸿章从外国买来的一台造纸机，现在每天生产的纸张比它年青的时候要多三倍半。
    这台机器仍旧在我国最老的一个造纸厂——天章造纸厂的厂房里。天章厂的前身是李鸿章当年创办的“伦章造纸局”。
    这台机器运到上海的时候，上海那时还没有发电厂，机器靠蒸汽机带动，每天只能生产两吨纸。现在，这台机器上的许多六角螺丝帽，几乎都磨成光头了，铸在烘缸上的英文牌号也已经模糊得难以辨认。像这样古老的机器，早该当作废铁回炉了。但是，现在它每天生产的纸张已经达到九吨，是六十六年来最高的纪录。
    天章厂在前年合营以后，职工们对这台机器非常爱护。职工们说，如果需要的话，我们准备再用它四、五十年。
