Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 27th: The Japanese cabinet finalized the draft budget for the 1957 fiscal year last night. The expenditures and revenues in this draft budget are both 1,137.4 billion yen, an increase of 3.8 billion yen compared to the original proposal submitted by the Ministry of Finance. The total amount of this new budget, formulated according to the "active fiscal" policy of the Ishibashi cabinet, sets a new record for budgets in the post-war years.

With the consent of the United States, Japan will pay 141.1 billion yen for military expenses in the new fiscal year starting in April, an increase of 400 million yen compared to fiscal year 1956. Of this military expenditure, 29.6 billion yen will be given to the United States as "defense burden sharing." In the new fiscal year, Japan will focus on expanding the strength of its air force and navy.

Japan plans to pay 21.5 billion yen for war reparations in the 1957 fiscal year, more than double the 10 billion yen in the 1956 fiscal year. The Ishibashi cabinet hopes to improve diplomatic and economic relations with Southeast Asian countries through the settlement of the reparations issue.

In the process of finalizing the draft budget, fierce disputes arose within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party over the issue of raising consumer rice prices, which delayed the finalization of the draft budget. The cabinet finally decided yesterday to cancel the original proposal to raise consumer rice prices, which had been strongly opposed by the people. However, it also decided to raise the passenger and freight rates of the state-owned railways by an average of 13%.

The draft budget proposes to reduce income tax by 100 billion yen, but increases some other taxes.

The opposition Socialist Party issued a statement today demanding a comprehensive revision of the 1957 budget. The statement emphasized the danger that the government's draft budget would cause fiscal expansion and price increases. The statement pointed out that the 100 billion yen tax cut touted in the government's draft budget only serves those with an annual income of 500,000 yen or more, who account for 6% of the population. The vast majority of taxpayers with an annual income of 300,000 yen or less will not receive any benefit from the tax cut due to rising prices. The Socialist Party also criticized the government for disregarding fundamental social welfare measures in the budget and for failing to put forward concrete guidelines for full employment.

The Japanese government will submit the 1957 draft budget to the Diet for approval on February 2nd.

    日本政府确定今年预算草案
    社会党认为将引起财政膨胀物价上涨
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本内阁昨天晚上决定了1957财政年度的预算草案。这个预算草案的岁出和岁入都是一万一千三百七十四亿日元，比大藏省提出的原案增加了三十八亿日元。这个根据石桥内阁的“积极财政”政策制订的新预算的总额，创战后历年预算的新纪录。
    经过美国的同意，日本在从4月开始的新的财政年度中将支付一千四百一十一亿日元作为军费，比1956年度增加四亿日元。这笔军费中有二九六亿日元，要交给美国作为“防卫分担费”。在新的财政年度中，日本将着重扩充空军和海军的力量。
    日本准备在1957年度支付的战争赔偿将为二百一十五亿日元，比1956年度的一百亿日元增加一倍以上。石桥内阁希望通过赔偿问题的解决，改善同东南亚国家的外交和经济关系。
    在确定预算草案的过程中，执政的自由民主党内部曾经对提高大米消费价格的问题发生激烈争执，使预算草案迟迟未能定案。内阁昨天最后决定取消遭到人民强烈反对的提高大米消费价格的原案。但是，它同时决定把国营铁道的客货运费平均提高13％。
    预算草案中提出将减少所得税一千亿日元，但是增加了另外一些税收。
    反对党社会党在今天发表声明，要求全面重新编制1957年度预算。声明强调政府预算草案将引起财政膨胀和物价上涨的危险性。声明指出，政府预算草案中所标榜的一千亿日元减税，只是对占人口6％的一年收入在五十万日元以上的人的服务，占纳税人绝大多数的一年收入在三十万日元以下的人，将因物价上涨而得不到减税的任何好处。社会党并且抨击政府在预算中漠视社会福利的根本措施，也没有对充分就业提出具体方针。
    日本政府将在2月2日把1957年度预算草案提交国会批准。
