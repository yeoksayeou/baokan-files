Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 20th: The Hungarian News Agency reports that József Dudás, one of the key organizers of the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion in Hungary in October 1956, and another counter-revolutionary, János Szabó, have been sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Hungarian People's Republic and were executed on January 19th.

The Military Tribunal of the Hungarian Supreme Court held a six-day trial of the counter-revolutionary case of Dudás and János Szabó, hearing testimony from forty-four witnesses from both the plaintiff and defendant sides. After hearing the testimony, the court unanimously determined that the two counter-revolutionary criminals were guilty of organizing an armed rebellion in an attempt to overthrow the people's democratic system and therefore sentenced them to death.

Dudás infiltrated the workers' movement in Romania before the Second World War, engaging in espionage activities. After being captured and released, he came to Hungary, where the Horthy fascist government assigned him the task of stirring up trouble within the Hungarian workers' movement. At the end of 1944, the Horthy government sent Dudás to the Soviet Army Headquarters, posing as a representative of the Hungarian Communist Party to conduct fake armistice negotiations with the Soviet Army Headquarters. In 1946, Dudás was sentenced to imprisonment for participating in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy. After his release, he became one of the organizers of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in October 1956. He led an armed group of about three hundred people to control the so-called "Hungarian National Revolutionary Committee." At the end of October of the same year, under the guise of the ceasefire order issued by the Imre Nagy government, Dudás launched armed counter-revolutionary bandits to engage in terrorist and criminal activities, arresting, torturing, and killing many Communist Party members. On the evenings of November 2nd and 3rd last year, Dudás also relied on his armed group to seize the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to use the radio and establish direct contact with imperialist organizations. In addition, before this, he had requested foreign armed intervention in Hungary.

Szabó had also committed several crimes involving espionage and illegally crossing borders. During the Hungarian incident, under the instructions of József Dudás, he led a fifty-person "task force" to carry out white terror activities.

    匈牙利军事法庭判处反革命分子杜达什死刑
    新华社布达佩斯20日电　据匈牙利通讯社报道，1956年10月匈牙利反革命武装暴动的重要组织者之一约瑟夫·杜达什，和另一个反革命分子亚诺什·萨波，已经被匈牙利人民共和国最高法院军事法庭判处死刑，并且于1月19日被处决。
    匈牙利最高法院军事法庭对杜达什和亚诺什·萨波的反革命案件共审讯了六天，听取了原告和被告方面的四十四个证人的作证。在听取作证之后，法庭一致断定这两个反革命罪犯犯有组织武装暴动企图推翻人民民主制度的罪行，因此判处他们死刑。
    杜达什早在第二次世界大战以前就在罗马尼亚混进工人运动，从事间谍活动。他在被捕获释之后来到匈牙利，当时的霍尔蒂法西斯政府交给他在匈牙利工人运动内部进行挑拨活动的任务。1944年底，霍尔蒂政府把杜达什派往苏联军队司令部，冒充匈牙利共产党代表同苏军司令部进行假的停战谈判。1946年，杜达什因参加反革命阴谋被判处徒刑。在获释以后，他又成为匈牙利1956年10月反革命暴动的组织人之一。他率领约三百人的武装人员控制了所谓“匈牙利全国革命委员会”。同年10月底，在伊姆雷·纳吉政府发布的停火令的掩饰下，杜达什又发动武装反革命匪徒从事恐怖和犯罪行动，逮捕、拷打和杀死了许多共产党员。去年11月2日到3日晚上，杜达什还依靠他的武装集团霸占了匈牙利外交部，以便利用电台并和帝国主义组织取得直接联系。此外，在这以前，他还曾经请求外国对匈牙利进行武装干涉。
    萨波也犯过好几起从事间谍活动和非法偷越国境等罪行。在匈牙利事件期间，根据约瑟夫·杜达什的指示，他曾经率领五十人的“特遣队”进行白色恐怖活动。
