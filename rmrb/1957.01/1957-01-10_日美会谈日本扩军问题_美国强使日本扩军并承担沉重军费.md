Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Allison, and Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Forces Far East, Laniel, held talks today with Japanese Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi regarding the issue of Japan's military expansion.

After the meeting, Kishi Nobusuke stated that they "comprehensively exchanged views on the basis for concrete negotiations on the future defense issues [of Japan]." Kishi Nobusuke did not elaborate on the content of the talks. However, he revealed that the U.S. side stated during the meeting: "It is not good for it to be publicized that [Japan's] defense spending is the same as the previous year."

According to Kyodo News, "The U.S. side seems to have emphasized their hope that Japan strengthen its defense capabilities in both quality and quantity, in accordance with the annual plan of the six-year defense plan that the Japanese side had already explained." The news agency also said: "The Japanese government decided yesterday to: adhere to the policy of gradually increasing 'defense capabilities,' that is, to strengthen 'defense capabilities' in terms of quality, and to reduce the budget number for military spending to the minimum, with reference to past budget usage."

Japan's direct military spending in 1956 totaled more than 143 billion yen, which was about 8 billion yen more than in 1955. In addition, Japan's so-called "defense burden sharing expenses" for supporting the U.S. military stationed in Japan totaled 30 billion yen last year.

    日美会谈日本扩军问题
    美国强使日本扩军并承担沉重军费
    据新华社9日讯　东京消息：美国驻日大使艾利逊和远东美军总司令兰尼兹尔，今天同日本外务相岸信介进行了有关日本扩军问题的会谈。
    岸信介在会谈后发表谈话说：他们“就（日本）今后的防御问题的具体谈判的基础，全面地交换了意见”。岸信介没有详细说明会谈的内容。但是他透露，美方在会谈中表示：“（日本的）防卫费和上一年度一样这件事被宣传起来，是不好的”。
    据共同社说：“美方在会谈中似乎强调了他们的希望，希望根据日本方面早已作了说明的六年防卫计划的年度规划，在质和量方面都加强日本的防御力量。”这个通讯社还说：“日本政府在昨天已经决定要：坚持逐渐增加‘防御力量’的方针，即从质量上加强‘防御力量’，参照过去预算使用情况，把军费的预算数缩小到最低限度。”
    日本的直接军费在1956年共达一千四百三十多亿日元，已经比1955年度增加了约八十亿日元。另外，日本供养驻日美军的所谓“防卫分担费”在去年度共计三百亿日元。
