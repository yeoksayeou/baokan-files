    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that further expanding the democratic life of the country and launching a struggle against bureaucratism are important tasks in the current national work. State supervisory organs should fully play their due role in this struggle. The Sixth National Supervisory Work Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Supervision has, in accordance with this instruction of the Party, arranged the work for 1957, aiming to implement the struggle against bureaucratism in all future work.
    In our country, the organs specifically responsible for supervising and inspecting the work of state organs are the state supervisory organs at all levels and their dispatched agencies. The specific tasks of the state supervisory organs, under the leadership of the Party and the government, are to closely integrate with the central work of the country in each period, inspect the implementation of state policies, laws, instructions, and resolutions by state organs and enterprise management departments, and supervise them to correctly implement the state's economic and cultural construction plans and socialist transformation plans. At the same time, they also handle people's complaints and accusations, and deal with disciplinary cases of those who violate the law and neglect their duties, in order to safeguard the dignity of state discipline and protect the interests of the people from infringement. To this end, state supervisory organs at all levels should constantly fight against bureaucratism and other misconduct, continuously consolidate state organs, and improve the work efficiency of state organs and enterprise management agencies.
    In the past few years, state supervisory organs at all levels have generally fulfilled their responsibilities. They have closely cooperated with the Party's supervisory organs and other relevant organs, relied on the active support of the broad masses and cadres, inspected and handled many incidents that violated state policies and laws and damaged the interests of the people, and combated bureaucratism. In terms of handling people's complaints, according to incomplete statistics, in the first half of 1956, state supervisory organs at all levels received more than 63,000 letters from the people and received more than 15,000 visits from the masses. For the problems reflected in these letters and visits, in addition to urging the relevant departments to handle them seriously, the state supervisory organs also selected more important cases from them, directly conducted investigations and handling, and some were even handled with great fanfare. This has played a certain role in educating state functionaries to strictly abide by laws and regulations, safeguard the interests of the state and the people, and improve the responsibility and work efficiency of functionaries. Some state supervisory organs have also systematically reflected the universal problems existing in a region or a work through the comprehensive research of inspections and letters and visits from the people, and put forward some major suggestions, which helped the leading organs to understand the situation and correct deviations.
    However, it must be pointed out that improving the work of state organs and enterprise management agencies is a long-term struggle. Many state functionaries do not go deep into the masses, do not conduct careful investigations and research, and are unwilling to do arduous and meticulous work; they one-sidedly expand administrative power, impatiently explain state policies to the masses and lower-level functionaries, do not humbly listen to their criticisms and suggestions, and even suppress their opinions; the life of the organs is extravagant and wasteful, they do not cherish state property, and do not care about the hardships of the masses. Individual elements with bad character, for the sake of their own or their unit's interests, even go so far as to use their power to suppress criticism, oppress the masses, and infringe on the interests of the masses. As for the bloated and large organizations, with many levels and overstaffing, this is a common phenomenon in the current state organs. This phenomenon in turn promotes bureaucratism and red tape in the organs, seriously affecting the efficiency of the organs' work, and dampening the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses.
    Therefore, the state supervisory organs must further strengthen their work and play their due role in the struggle against bureaucratism. If the state supervisory organs can well assist government organs and enterprise departments to overcome the shortcomings and errors in their work and eliminate the ills of bureaucratism, this will consolidate our state organs ideologically and organizationally.
    In the struggle against bureaucratism, on the one hand, the state supervisory organs should thoroughly inspect the bureaucratism of the higher leading organs and leading personnel, especially the bad style of making decisions, instructions, and orders without conducting careful investigation and research; on the other hand, when inspecting the serious bureaucratism and other violations of laws and regulations of the lower-level organs and lower-level functionaries, they should trace the roots. If their mistakes are related to certain errors and shortcomings of the higher leading organs, they should seriously and thoroughly inspect the errors and shortcomings of the higher levels, and seek a thorough solution to the problem, rather than perfunctorily dealing with it. The inspection of the poor quality of coal in the sixteen mining bureaus under the Ministry of Coal Industry by the Ministry of Supervision and the State Supervisory Bureau of Coal Industry in the second quarter of 1956 is a good example. This inspection not only exposed the shortcomings in the work of coal production units, but also focused on inspecting the lack of regular inspection and assessment of the implementation of quality indicators by the leading organs of the coal industry, which greatly helped to improve the work.
    To seriously inspect the bureaucratism of the higher leading organs and leading personnel requires firm principles and tenacious fighting spirit, requires a combination of top-down and bottom-up inspections, and also requires the responsible personnel of the supervisory organs at all levels to personally take action. However, many supervisory organs rarely inspect the shortcomings in the work of the higher management departments; rarely inspect whether the tasks assigned by the leadership organs of the county, special district, and even the province to the lower levels are too high or too large, and whether there are phenomena such as only paying attention to completing the tasks without explaining the working methods and without paying attention to the implementation of policies. Sometimes, when lower-level supervisory organs encounter difficulties in inspection, the higher-level supervisory organs do not provide timely and effective assistance. This seriously affects the improvement of the quality of supervisory work and cannot more effectively fight against bureaucratism. These phenomena should not exist for a long time. State supervisory organs at all levels should seriously correct these shortcomings.
    Bureaucratism is a very stubborn force of habit, and it is impossible for the supervisory organs to achieve results by fighting alone. The struggle against bureaucratism must have the joint efforts of all parties, and first of all must rely on the active participation of the broad masses. State supervisory organs at all levels must earnestly improve their work, strengthen the study of policies and business, and the investigation of actual situations, further closely cooperate with other relevant departments of the Party and the state, and mobilize the broad masses to carry out the struggle against bureaucratism.

    发挥国家监察机关在反官僚主义斗争中的作用
    党的第八次全国代表大会指出：进一步扩大国家的民主生活，开展反对官僚主义的斗争，是目前国家工作中的一个重要任务。国家监察机关应当在这个斗争中充分发挥它的应有作用。最近监察部召开的第六次全国监察工作会议，已经根据党的这个指示布置了1957年的工作，要把反对官僚主义的斗争贯彻到今后的一切工作中去。
    在我们的国家里，专门负责对国家机关工作实行监督和检查的机关，就是各级国家监察机关和它们的派出机构。国家监察机关的具体任务，是在党和政府的领导之下，密切结合国家每一时期的中心工作，对国家机关和事业、企业管理部门执行国家政策、法令、指示和决议的情况进行检查，监督它们正确地执行国家的经济文化建设计划和社会主义改造计划；同时还处理人民的申诉和控告，办理违法失职人员的纪律处分案件，以维护国家纪律的尊严，保护人民的利益不受侵犯。为此，各级国家监察机关就应当经常对官僚主义和其他不良行为进行斗争，不断地巩固国家机关，提高国家机关和事业、企业管理机关的工作效率。
    在过去几年间，各级国家监察机关一般地是履行了自己的职责的。它们同党的监察机关和其他有关机关密切配合，依靠广大群众和干部的积极支持，检查处理了不少违反国家政策法令和损害人民利益的事件，打击了官僚主义。在处理人民的控诉方面，据不完全的统计，1956年上半年各级国家监察机关收到人民来信六万三千多件，接见群众来访一万五千多人次。对于这些来信和来访所反映的问题，国家监察机关除督促有关部门认真处理外，还从中选择了比较重要的案件，直接进行调查处理，有的还进行了大张旗鼓的处理。这在教育国家工作人员严格遵守法纪，维护国家和人民的利益，提高工作人员的责任心和工作效率上起了一定的作用。有些国家监察机关，还通过检查和人民来信来访的综合研究，系统地反映了一个地区或一项工作中存在的普遍问题，提出了一些重大的建议，有助于领导机关了解情况和纠正偏差。
    但是必须指出，改进国家机关和事业、企业管理机关的工作，是一个长期的斗争。许多国家工作人员不深入群众，不认真调查研究，不愿意作艰苦细致的工作；片面地扩大行政的权力，不耐心地向群众和下级工作人员解释国家的政策，不虚心地听取他们的批评和建议，甚至对他们的意见实行压制；机关生活铺张浪费，不爱护国家资财，不关心群众的疾苦。个别品质不良的分子为了个人的或本单位的利益，甚至不惜利用职权压制批评，欺压群众，侵犯群众的利益。至于机构臃肿庞大，层次繁多，人浮于事，更是当前国家机关中的普遍现象。这种现象反过来助长了机关中的官僚主义和文牍主义，严重地影响了机关工作的效率，挫伤了群众的积极性和主动性。
    因此，国家监察机关必须进一步加强自己的工作，在反对官僚主义的斗争中发挥它的应有作用。国家监察机关如果能够很好地协助政府机关和企业部门克服工作中的缺点和错误，消除官僚主义的病害，这就会从思想上和组织上更加巩固我们的国家机关。
    国家监察机关在反对官僚主义的斗争中，一方面，应该深入检查上级领导机关和领导人员的官僚主义，特别是要检查他们不认真地进行调查研究，就作出决定、指示、命令的不良作风；另一方面，对下级机关和下级工作人员严重的官僚主义和其他违法乱纪行为，在进行检查的时候，应该追本求源。如果他们的错误同上级领导机关的某些错误和缺点有关，就应当认真地、彻底地检查上级的错误和缺点，求得问题的彻底解决，而不应当马虎了事。1956年第二季度，监察部和煤炭工业国家监察局对煤炭工业部所属十六个矿务局煤炭质量低劣的检查，就是一个较好的例子。这次检查，不但揭发了煤炭生产单位工作中的缺点，而且着重检查了煤炭工业领导机关对质量指标的执行情况缺乏经常的检查和考核等问题，对改进工作有很大帮助。
    认真检查上级领导机关和领导人员的官僚主义，需要有坚定的原则性和顽强的斗争精神，需要自上而下和自下而上的检查相结合，还需要各级监察机关的负责人员亲自动手。但是，许多监察机关却很少检查上级管理部门的工作缺点；很少检查县、专区以至省的领导机关给下级布置的任务是否过高过大，是否有只注意完成任务而不交代工作方法、不管政策执行情况等现象。有时下级监察机关在检查中遇到困难，上级监察机关也没有给予及时的有力的帮助。这就严重地影响到监察工作质量的提高，不能更有效地同官僚主义作斗争。这些现象是不应该长期存在的。各级国家监察机关应该认真纠正这些缺点。
    官僚主义是一种很顽强的习惯势力，绝不是监察机关孤军奋斗所能奏效的。反官僚主义的斗争必须有各方面的共同努力，首先必须依靠广大群众的积极参加。各级国家监察机关必须认真地改善自己的工作，加强政策、业务学习和实际情况的调查，进一步同党的和国家的其他有关部门密切配合，动员广大群众开展反官僚主义的斗争。
