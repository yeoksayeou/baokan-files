Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 23rd: Czechoslovakia and Romania have decided to take specific measures to conclude a long-term economic agreement by June of this year. This was decided during talks in Bucharest from January 17th to 19th between the Czechoslovak Communist Party delegation and the Romanian Workers' Party delegation.

The two sides also determined that, in addition to the recommendations passed at the seventh meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the long-term agreement will stipulate measures related to coordinating long-term investment plans to develop the chemical industry, agricultural production, use Romanian roads, make better use of Romanian ports, and develop Romanian lignite. The two sides will also agree on various measures, especially measures to strengthen the exchange of consumer goods, in order to more fully meet the material needs of the people of both countries.

The two party delegations unanimously agreed to recommend that their countries' governments establish a mixed group of experts from both countries to prepare materials for the long-term economic agreement between the two countries.

In a communiqué issued on the 22nd, the representatives of the two parties expressed their unanimous belief that the continuous strengthening of relations between socialist countries will consolidate the economies of each country and the economy of the entire socialist camp. In discussing the further development of economic relations recommended by the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the communiqué pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen cooperation, especially in coordinating future basic construction—first of all in the chemical industry sector—and to create conditions for continuously expanding the exchange of goods between each other.

    捷罗两党代表团会谈决定
    捷罗两国将缔结长期经济协定
    新华社布加勒斯特23日电　捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚已决定采取一些具体措施，以便到今年6月间缔结一项长期经济协定。这是捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团同罗马尼亚工人党代表团17日到19日在布加勒斯特会谈时决定的。
    双方还确定，长期协定的内容除了八国经济互助委员会第七次会议通过的建议外，还将规定有关协调长期投资计划的措施，以发展化学工业、农业生产，使用罗马尼亚的道路，更好地使用罗马尼亚的港口，开发罗马尼亚的褐煤。双方还要商定各种措施特别是关于加强消费品交换的措施，以便更充分地满足两国人民的物质要求。
    两党代表团一致同意：建议它们国家的政府成立由两国的专家组成的混合小组，来为两国之间的长期经济协定准备材料。
    两党的代表在22日发表的公报中表示，他们一致相信不断加强社会主义国家间的关系将巩固各国的经济以及整个社会主义阵营的经济。公报在谈到进一步发展经济互助委员会所建议的经济关系时指出，必需加强合作、特别是在协调未来的基本建设——首先是在化学工业部门——方面的合作，并且为不断扩大互相之间的货物交换创造条件。
