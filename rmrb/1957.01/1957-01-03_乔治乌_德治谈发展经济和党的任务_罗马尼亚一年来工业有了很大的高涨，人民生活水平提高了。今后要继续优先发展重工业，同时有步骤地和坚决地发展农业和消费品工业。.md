Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 31st: Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej delivered a report at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party on December 27 on various agenda items and on the tasks of party organizations, according to a TASS report.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Romanian working people, led by the working class, had achieved remarkable successes in the development of various sectors of the national economy due to the implementation of the Party's policies. During the period from 1948 to 1956, Romania's heavy industry, especially petroleum, mining, power, electrical equipment, and machine manufacturing, experienced a large upsurge. Light industry and the food industry also developed, and many enterprises producing daily necessities were established. Living standards have improved, but have not reached the standards set by the economic plan.

Industrial production in 1956 increased by 10% compared with 1955, and the production of the means of production increased by 13%. Due to the impact of the poor harvest, the production of consumer goods increased by only about 6%. Within a year, 16,000 homes were built (not including homes built by residents themselves). Residents' consumption increased in the first half of the year, but began to be affected by the poor harvest near the end of the year. Thanks to Soviet aid, we received grain and overcame many difficulties. In addition, some other measures have been taken to improve the supply of food and industrial products to residents.

Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that in Romania, the priority should continue to be given to the development of industries that produce the means of production. At the same time, he pointed out that attention must be paid to the methodical and firm development of agriculture and the consumer goods industry. He said that we believe it is necessary to change the proportional relationship between funds used for accumulation and those used for consumption, so as to use a greater proportion of the national income to meet the material and cultural needs of the people.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that even if the pace is slowed down to adapt to resource conditions and the realistic possibilities of the national economy, the total amount of investment must be able to guarantee the further development of socialist industry. The existence of a powerful socialist world economic system and fraternal economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries make it possible for us to purchase machinery, industrial equipment, semi-finished products, and other industrial products that we do not produce from these countries on favorable terms.

Gheorghiu-Dej then described issues such as expanding the powers of the leading organs of socialist industrial and agricultural enterprises and the People's Congresses, as well as democratic centralism. He said that democratic centralism is the basic organizational principle of our people's democratic state. He pointed out the need to implement unified and coordinated leadership over economic and socio-cultural activities, while also encouraging initiative from below, and combining the two so that the working people have broad opportunities to carry out activities.

When talking about the issue of wages, he said that our main concern is always to improve the working and living conditions of the working class with the progress of the country's economic development. This concern is determined by the nature of the people's democratic state and by the nature of our party. As a result of the measures taken, wage standards have increased by an average of 36% throughout the national economy.

    乔治乌—德治谈发展经济和党的任务
    罗马尼亚一年来工业有了很大的高涨，人民生活水平提高了。今后要继续优先发展重工业，同时有步骤地和坚决地发展农业和消费品工业。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社布加勒斯特12月31日讯：乔治乌—德治同志12月27日在罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会全体会议上就议程上的各项问题和关于党组织的任务作了报告。
    乔治乌—德治说，以工人阶级为首的罗马尼亚劳动人民由于实行了党的政策，在国民经济各部门发展中获得了卓越的成就。在1948年到1956年期间，罗马尼亚的重工业，特别是石油、采矿、动力、电工器材和机器制造业有了很大的高涨。轻工业和食品工业也发展了，建立了许多生产日用品的企业。生活水平提高了，但是没有达到经济计划所规定的标准。
    1956年的工业生产比1955年提高了10％，生产资料的生产提高了13％。由于歉收的影响，消费品的生产仅仅提高了6％左右。在一年之内，建造了一万六千套住宅（居民自己建造的住宅不计算在内）。上半年居民的消费量增加了，但是，将近年终的时候，开始受到了歉收的影响。由于苏联的援助，我们得到了谷物，克服了许多困难。此外，还采取了其他一些措施来改善对居民的粮食和工业品的供应。
    乔治乌—德治着重指出，在罗马尼亚要继续优先发展生产生产资料的工业。同时他指出，必须重视有步骤地和坚决地发展农业和消费品工业。他说，我们认为必须改变用于积累和用于消费的款项的对比关系，以便把更大一部分的国民收入用来满足人民的物质和文化上的需要。
    乔治乌—德治说，即使为了适应资源情况和国民经济现实可能性而放慢速度，投资总额也必须要能保证社会主义工业的进一步发展。强大的社会主义世界经济体系的存在、同苏联和其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的经济合作，使我们有可能以有利的条件从这些国家购到机器、工业装备、半制品和我们没有生产的其他工业品。
    乔治乌—德治接着叙述了扩大社会主义工农业企业领导机关和人民会议的权力以及民主集中制等问题。他说，民主集中制是我们人民民主国家的基本组织原则。他指出有必要对经济和社会文化活动实行统一的、协调的领导，同时还要鼓励下面的主动性，并使这两者结合起来，以便劳动人民有广泛的机会来展开活动。
    他在谈到工资问题时说，我们主要的关怀经常是放在随着国家经济发展的进展来改善工人阶级的劳动和生活条件上。这种关怀是由人民民主国家的性质、由我们党的性质决定的。由于采取了措施，在整个国民经济中，工资标准平均提高了36％。
