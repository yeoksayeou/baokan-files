    The State Council calls on all coal mine workers to only take one day off during this year's Spring Festival and continue production as usual for the remaining two days. The coal produced during these two days will be considered surplus production beyond the first quarter's plan, in order to alleviate the tight situation of coal supply falling short of demand for industrial production and civilian use in the first quarter. This is an emergency measure by the state and a major, glorious task for all coal mine workers.
    As everyone knows, the growth rate of coal consumption for industrial production and urban and rural residents has far exceeded the growth rate of coal production, resulting in a tight coal supply situation in the Chinese market since the fourth quarter of last year. In order to alleviate this tension, national state organs, groups, troops, and schools at all levels have reduced the amount of coal used for heating and cooking. Industrial transportation departments have vigorously saved coal, and many other efforts have been made. However, the situation of coal supply falling short of demand is still tense. Industrial transportation departments do not have much coal in storage, and coal sales stations in many places are selling out as soon as coal arrives. Some residents even cannot buy coal for several days. Under these circumstances, the State Council's call on all coal mine workers to take two fewer days off during the Spring Festival and continue production as usual is indeed a necessary emergency measure.
    The Spring Festival is a grand festival traditionally celebrated by the Chinese people. It is conceivable that coal mine workers have worked hard throughout the past year and are looking forward to a good three-day rest during the Spring Festival. Many workers have already made plans to celebrate the Spring Festival: some originally planned to reunite with their families, some planned to visit relatives and friends, some have booked movie or theater tickets, and some have organized Spring Festival entertainment programs, and so on. However, in order to obey the supreme interests of the people and to complete the urgent and glorious task entrusted by the state, we believe that all coal mine workers are willing to resolutely sacrifice their plans to celebrate the Spring Festival. The families and relatives of coal mine workers will certainly understand this.
    If coal mine workers across the country take two fewer days off during the Spring Festival and continue production as usual, they can produce more than 400,000 tons of coal for the country, which can prevent and reduce the danger of "shutdowns" in many factories, trains, and ships in the first quarter, and can also relieve many residents from the threat of coal shortage in the first quarter. Coal mine workers give up two days of holiday leave to continue production, which brings such great benefits to the country and the people. Therefore, when the people of the whole country celebrate the Spring Festival, they cannot forget the comrades who are sticking to other production and work posts during the Spring Festival, and they cannot forget the worker comrades who are insisting on producing coal for them. People who sacrifice their own happiness for the happiness of others are always models for the masses and are always worthy of people's gratitude and respect!
    It will be difficult for coal mine workers to continue production for two days during the Spring Festival holiday. Although these difficulties are not serious compared to the urgent tasks assigned to them by the state, small difficulties are still difficulties. This requires the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in the mining areas to deeply understand the specific situation, carefully make appropriate arrangements for the existing problems, and help workers overcome difficulties smoothly. The leaders of the mining areas also need to pay enough attention to product quality, safe production, and production preparation work. The people's committees of various provinces and cities, the commercial and transportation departments, and the administrative departments of the mining areas are also expected to work hard to ensure the supply of New Year's goods for coal mine workers, so as to ensure that workers can attend work normally. Electricity workers need to ensure the power supply for coal mines during the Spring Festival production. Railway workers must also guarantee the transportation of coal during the Spring Festival. If the country has more than 400,000 tons of coal in the first quarter, then the tense situation of coal supply falling short of demand during this period can be greatly alleviated.

### 煤矿职工的光荣任务

    煤矿职工的光荣任务
    国务院号召全体煤矿职工，在今年春节期间只休假一天，其余两天仍然照常生产，把这两天生产的煤作为第一季度计划以外的超额生产，以便缓和第一季度工业生产和民用煤炭供不应求的紧张情况。这是国家的一项紧急措施，是全体煤矿职工的一项重大的光荣的任务。
    大家知道，由于工业生产和城乡居民所用煤炭增长的速度，大大超过煤炭生产增长的速度，使我国市场上从去年第四季度以来，就出现了煤炭供不应求的紧张情况。为了缓和这种紧张情况，全国各级国家机关、团体、部队和学校都纷纷削减取暖和炊事用煤的数量，工业交通运输部门大力节约煤炭，其他方面也作了很多努力，可是，目前煤炭供不应求的情况仍然紧张，工业交通运输部门的储煤不多，许多地方的售煤站几乎是随到随光，而且某些居民甚至好几天都买不到煤。在这种情况下，国务院号召全体煤矿职工春节少休假两天而照常生产，的确是一项不得已的紧急措施。
    春节，这是我国人民相沿成习的盛大节日。可以想像得到，煤矿职工在过去一年内进行了紧张的劳动，是指望着在春节期间好好休息三天的。许多职工早就作好了欢度春节的打算：有的原来打算要跟家人团聚，有的打算要探亲访友，有的已订好电影票或戏票，有的组织了春节联欢节目，等等。可是，为了服从人民群众的最高利益，为了完成国家给予的紧急而光荣的任务，我们相信，全体煤矿职工是愿意毅然决然地牺牲自己欢度春节的计划的，煤矿职工的家属和亲友们，对于这一点也一定可以谅解。
    全国煤矿职工春节少休假两天而照常生产，就可以多给国家生产出四十多万吨煤炭，就可以使许多工厂、火车、轮船在第一季度能够避免和减少“停火”的危险，也可以使许多居民在第一季度能够解除缺煤的威胁。煤矿职工放弃两天节日休假而照常生产，就给国家和人民带来了这么大的好处。因此，全国人民在过春节的时候，跟不能忘记在春节期间坚持着其他生产岗位和工作岗位的同志们一样，也不能忘记为了他们而坚持生产煤炭的职工同志们。为了别人的快乐而牺牲自己的快乐的人，永远是人民群众的模范，永远值得人们的感激和尊敬！
    煤矿职工们在春节假期里要有两天仍然坚持生产，是会发生一些困难的。这些困难比起国家交给他们的紧急任务来，虽然算不得严重，但是小困难毕竟也是困难。这就需要矿区的党、行政、工会和青年团组织深入了解具体情况，对存在的问题细致地作好适当安排，帮助职工顺利地克服困难。对于产品质量、安全生产和生产准备工作，矿区领导方面也需要给予足够的重视。对于煤矿职工们的年货供应工作，更希望各省、市人民委员会，商业、交通运输部门和矿区行政方面努力负责作好，以保证职工能够正常出勤。电业职工需要作好对煤矿春节期间进行生产的电力供应工作。铁路职工也要保证作好春节期间的煤炭运输工作。第一季度国家多了四十多万吨煤炭，那末，这个期间煤炭供不应求的紧张情况就可以大为减轻。
