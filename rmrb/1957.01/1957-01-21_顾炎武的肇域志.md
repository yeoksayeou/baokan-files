Newly Discovered Cultural Relics

    Gu Yanwu's Zhaoyu Zhi
    Gu Yanwu's "Zhaoyu Zhi," a sister work to his "Tianxia Qunguo Libing Shu" (Book on the Advantages and Disadvantages of All the Kingdoms Under Heaven), has been discovered in Kunming. This "Zhaoyu Zhi," consisting of over 1.3 million words, records the economic and natural conditions of China before the Ming Dynasty. It is an important historical resource for studying Chinese water conservancy, agriculture, mining, transportation, and other aspects before the Ming Dynasty. His manuscript was lost during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period. The edition discovered in Yunnan is a manuscript from the Tongzhi period, which completely preserves the original forty volumes of the book, something that has not been seen domestically before.

    顾炎武的肇域志
    顾炎武作的“天下群国利病书”的姊妹篇“肇域志”在昆明发现。这一部一百三十余万言的“肇域志”，记载明代以前中国的经济和自然状况，是研究明代以前中国水利、农业、矿产、交通等历史的重要资料。他的手稿已在太平天国时期丧失，云南省发现的是同治年间的手本，它无缺地保存原书四十册，国内还未有过。　（据新华社讯）
