Care for Miners
	Fushun Tiger Platform Coal Mine provides miners with regular physical examinations, and those found to have chronic diseases or occupational diseases are given early treatment. Workers with illnesses mostly recover their health after a short period of recuperation in a quiet sanatorium. This is a picture of convalescents sunbathing and strolling at the entrance of the sanatorium. Photo by Cui Changchun (Xinhua News Agency draft)

    对矿工的关怀
    抚顺老虎台煤矿对矿工定期检查身体，一发现有慢性病或有职业病患者，就给予早期治疗。有病的工人们在环境清静的疗养所里经短期疗养后，大都恢复了健康。这是疗养员在疗养所门口晒太阳、散步。　　　　崔长春摄　　（新华社稿）
