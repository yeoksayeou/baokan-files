    Welcome International Essays
    Since the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, your newspaper has successively published several international essays by comrades Feng Zhidan, Jin Feng, and Tan Wenrui. These articles are sharply satirical of the imperialists, and the writing style is lively and full of literary flavor. After reading them, we have a clearer understanding of the ugly faces and despicable conspiracies of the imperialists, as well as the quarrels and infighting within the imperialist bloc. We hope that your newspaper will regularly publish such articles.

    欢迎刊登国际小品
    自从英法侵略埃及以来，你报先后发表了冯之丹、金凤、谭文瑞等同志的几篇国际小品。这些文章对帝国主义者的讽刺尖锐，笔法也生动，富有文学味道。读后，我们对帝国主义的丑恶面目和卑鄙阴谋，以及帝国主义集团的争吵、倾轧，看得更清楚。希望你报经常刊登这类文章。
