Xinhua News Agency, Stalinabad, January 21st: The award ceremony for the Tajik Republic's receipt of the Order of Lenin was held on January 20th at the Opera and Ballet Theater in Stalinabad, the capital of Tajikistan. The Soviet government awarded the Republic this high honor in recognition of the achievements made by the Tajik Republic in developing agriculture over the past year.

Nikolai Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, who arrived from Moscow the day before, presented the Order of Lenin to the Republic in the presence of many advanced agricultural workers, scientific and cultural workers, and guests from fraternal republics. On behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, he extended warm congratulations to the working people of Tajikistan.

Bulganin then spoke of the tremendous achievements the Republic had made in its development under the Soviet system. He said that Stalinabad is now a city with a population of over 200,000. More than thirty years ago, there were only three small villages in the place of Stalinabad. In 1957, Tajikistan's industrial output will increase to 28 times that of 1913, and cotton production will increase to 14 times that of 1913. Such fundamental changes are only possible under the Soviet system and under the leadership of the Communist Party.

When talking about the international situation, Bulganin pointed out the Soviet Union's struggle to ease international tensions, eliminate the "Cold War," consolidate peace, and guarantee the security of all countries.

Bulganin said that the recent visit of the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union was a vivid manifestation of the fraternal friendship that exists between socialist countries. The Soviet and Chinese people have formed an unbreakable fraternal friendship and are conducting comradely cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. The struggle to build a communist society on the principles of Marxism-Leninism will unite us forever.

Bulganin said that we are deeply convinced that the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and the friendship and cooperation between all socialist countries and peace-loving countries, will guarantee lasting peace and security. We need lasting peace and security in order to carry out the great peaceful socialist construction for the welfare and happiness of our two peoples, and for the benefit of a bright future for all mankind.

In the last part of his speech, Bulganin called on the representatives of the Tajik people not to be satisfied with the achievements they have already made, but to work even better than they are now.

    塔吉克共和国荣获列宁勋章
    布尔加宁代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团授勋
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社斯大林纳巴德21日讯：1月20日在塔吉克首都斯大林纳巴德歌剧和巴蕾舞剧院中，举行了塔吉克共和国荣获列宁勋章的授勋大会。苏联政府授予共和国这个崇高的奖赏，是奖励塔吉克共和国在过去一年中在发展农业方面所取得的成就。
    前一天从莫斯科来到这里的苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在许多先进农业工作者、科学和文化工作者以及各兄弟加盟共和国的来宾面前，授予共和国以列宁勋章。他代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团、共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议，向塔吉克劳动人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    布尔加宁接着谈到这个共和国在苏维埃制度下在自己的发展方面取得的巨大的成就。他说，斯大林纳巴德现在是一个有二十多万居民的城市。而在三十多年前，在斯大林纳巴德这个地方只不过有三个不大的村落。1957年塔吉克的工业产量将增加为1913年的二十八倍，棉花产量将增加为1913年的十四倍。这样根本的变化只有在苏维埃制度条件下和在共产党领导下才有可能实现。
    布尔加宁谈到国际局势问题的时候，指出苏联为缓和国际紧张局势、消除“冷战”、巩固和平和保障各国安全所进行的斗争。
    布尔加宁说，中华人民共和国政府代表团最近对苏联的访问是社会主义国家之间存在的兄弟友谊的鲜明表现。苏联人民和中国人民结成牢不可破的兄弟友谊，并且在政治、经济、文化和其他方面进行同志式的合作。在马克思列宁主义的原则上争取建设共产主义社会的斗争把我们永远团结在一起。
    布尔加宁说，我们深信，苏联和中华人民共和国的友谊和合作、所有社会主义国家和爱好和平国家的友谊和合作将能保证持久和平和安全，我们需要持久和平和安全，以便为了我们两国人民的福利和幸福进行伟大的和平的社会主义建设，以利于整个人类美好的将来。
    布尔加宁在讲话的最后一部分，号召塔吉克人民的代表不要满足于已有的成就，而要比现在工作得更好。
