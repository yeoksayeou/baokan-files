    (Our report) Thanks to the earnest leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels and the vigorous assistance of the people, the 1956 demobilized soldier resettlement work has achieved great success.

    In 1956, the Chinese People's Liberation Army demobilized more than 740,000 people. In addition to the more than 130,000 people directly assigned by the central government to factories, mines, geological exploration, transportation, water conservancy, basic construction, and cultural, educational, and health work positions, about 70% of the people happily returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production.

    The demobilization work was carried out in a planned and organized manner. Before demobilized soldiers left the army, the army conducted ideological education for them, encouraging them to actively labor and work hard after returning to their hometowns, maintain the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living of the People's Liberation Army, abide by government decrees, and actively participate in militia and reserve service. These educational efforts made the necessary ideological preparations for local resettlement work. When leaving the army, the demobilized soldiers expressed their determination to actively participate in socialist construction after demobilization.

    Although the 1956 demobilized soldier resettlement work was in a situation of busy construction tasks and relatively serious disaster conditions in some areas, governments at all levels and the broad masses of the people still actively carried it out in accordance with the State Council's resolution on resettling demobilized construction soldiers. Before the demobilized soldiers arrived, the local government actively prepared reception stations and transit stations, and planned to arrange employment for the demobilized soldiers. After the demobilized soldiers arrived at the local level, the local government generally organized welcomes and receptions. Leaders and staff members of many counties and cities personally welcomed them, offered condolences, and introduced the local work situation, encouraging the demobilized soldiers to work actively and produce diligently.

    The difficulties faced by demobilized soldiers after returning to their hometowns have also been resolved. In the past year alone, the state allocated more than 19.83 million yuan in subsidies to help demobilized soldiers in production and life. According to statistics from 46 counties in Shandong Province, such as Heze and Laiyang, more than 3,000 public houses were distributed to demobilized soldiers in the first half of the year, and the masses helped build more than 4,000 houses. The province also distributed 3.6 million yuan in demobilization subsidies. Many civil affairs and health departments are very concerned about the treatment of diseases among demobilized soldiers. For example, Baixiang County in Hebei Province divided the county into 13 treatment units for subdistrict treatment, and both public and private medical departments included medical work for demobilized soldiers in their plans.

    The demobilization and resettlement work in several major cities last year was also done well. According to statistics from eight cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai alone, all 9,512 demobilized soldiers received from January to August last year have been properly resettled. Not only have these demobilized soldiers been resettled as soon as they were received, but they have also basically achieved appropriate job assignments, reasonable level of treatment, and satisfaction among the demobilized soldiers.

    The demobilized soldiers have undergone long-term education by the Party and the tempering of revolutionary war in the army. The vast majority of them actively participate in production and construction work after demobilization, and are able to unite the masses to work actively, creating countless advanced experiences and exemplary deeds. They have become an important force in agricultural production and other construction undertakings, and many have been elected as leading backbones of various grass-roots organizations. For example, in 1956, eleven counties including Yanjin in Henan Province, Xiangtan in Hunan Province, Fu'an in Fujian Province, and Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province resettled more than 18,000 demobilized soldiers. Among them, 8,339 served as Party branch secretaries, Party branch committee members, township heads and deputy heads, League branch secretaries, and agricultural cooperative chairmen and deputy chairmen, accounting for 46% of the total number of demobilized soldiers. In Baixiang County, Hebei Province, more than 60% of the demobilized soldiers serve as cadres in townships, villages, and cooperatives. In the four townships of Zhongnan, Xialing, Guihua, and Hongda in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, 53 demobilized soldiers are all backbones of the cooperative. In 1956, more than 120,000 demobilized soldiers across the country were selected as activists in socialist construction at the county and city levels, and more than 4,000 were selected as activists in socialist construction at the provincial level.

    Demobilized soldiers have also played a significant role on other fronts of national construction. Many geological exploration teams, engineering construction teams, forest logging teams, water conservancy project teams, and large-scale farms in our country have demobilized and transferred soldiers participating, or are formed with them as the backbone. In Anshan Iron and Steel, our country's largest steel base, there are more than 10,000 demobilized and transferred soldiers working.

    In various production and work positions, the masses generally reflect that demobilized soldiers "work first, rest later; combat is heroic, labor is exemplary."

    Demobilized soldiers can play a significant role on various fronts, which is also inseparable from the fact that local Party and government organs, as well as enterprises and institutions, earnestly implement the Party and the state's policies and continue to cultivate and educate them. In Funing County, Hebei Province, there are more than 3,300 demobilized soldiers. The county party committee decided that from the county party committee members to the general cadres, whoever goes to the countryside must understand the resettlement of demobilized soldiers. This has created an atmosphere of caring for demobilized soldiers among cadres and the masses throughout the county. In its work in the county and townships, Funing County warmly unites with and boldly uses demobilized soldiers, greatly promoting their enthusiasm and enabling them to play a significant role in various tasks. Dalian General Machinery Factory always gives priority to recruiting demobilized soldiers in accordance with the State Council's resolution whenever it recruits employees. When demobilized soldiers arrive at the factory, the factory director personally introduces them to the factory's situation and production knowledge. After the work is assigned, in order to help them master the business as soon as possible, some are first sent to part-time technical schools to study, and most of them are trained by designated workshops, sections, and offices. The factory also provides necessary care and attention to their living conditions. Therefore, the demobilized soldiers in this factory can generally master production technology quickly, and many labor models have emerged. There are many such examples in various provinces and cities.

    In order to do a good job in resettling demobilized soldiers, various provinces and cities conducted comprehensive inspections in July and August last year. During this inspection, various localities dealt with some incidents of deliberately making things difficult for and excluding demobilized soldiers that had not been dealt with in the past; re-handled those that had been handled improperly; appropriately resolved the problems of those who had difficulties in life; and admitted those who were sick and had no home to go to into nursing homes or sanatoriums.

    The achievements of the 1956 demobilized soldier resettlement work are great, but there are also some problems. At present, various localities are addressing these problems in accordance with the State Council's "Notice on Carrying Out Activities of Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Servicemen and Cherishing the Government and Loving the People Around the 1957 Spring Festival" by combining education with solving practical problems. At the same time, various localities are also rewarding regions, units, and individuals that have done a good job in resettling demobilized soldiers in accordance with the state's regulations on awards, in order to improve demobilization and resettlement work.

### “干活在先，休息在后，战斗是英雄，劳动是模范”  七十万复员军人去年参加国家建设  各地正结合春节拥军优属活动改进复员安置工作

    七十万复员军人去年参加国家建设
    各地正结合春节拥军优属活动改进复员安置工作
    本报讯　1956年的复员军人安置工作，在各地党委、政府的认真领导和人民群众的大力协助下，已经取得很大的成绩。
    1956年中国人民解放军共复员了七十四万余人，除由中央直接安置了十三万余人到厂矿、地质勘探、交通、水利、基本建设和文教卫生等工作岗位外，约有近70％的人愉快地回乡参加了农业生产。
    复员工作是有计划有组织地进行的。在复员军人离开部队以前，部队方面对他们进行了思想教育，勉励他们回乡以后积极劳动，努力工作，保持人民解放军艰苦朴素的光荣传统，遵守政府法令，积极参加民兵和服预备役等。这些教育工作为地方的安置工作作了必要的思想准备。复员军人在离开部队的时候，都表示了复员后积极参加社会主义建设的决心。
    1956年复员军人的安置工作，虽然处在建设任务繁忙和某些地区灾情较严重的情况下，各级政府和广大人民仍然根据国务院关于安置复员建设军人的决议积极地进行。在复员军人未到达以前，当地政府就积极筹办接收站、转运站，并计划安排复员军人的就业工作。当复员军人到达地方以后，当地政府一般组织了欢迎和接待，许多县、市的领导工作人员亲自迎接，进行慰问，并介绍地方工作情况，勉励复员军人积极工作，努力生产。
    复员军人回乡以后的困难，也得到了解决。在去年一年内，国家就拨出了一千九百八十三万多元补助费，帮助复员军人生产和生活。山东省荷泽、莱阳等四十六个县上半年统计，分给了复员军人公屋三千余间，群众帮工修建了四千余间。全省还发放了复员补助款三百六十万元。对复员军人的疾病治疗，许多民政和卫生部门都很关心。如河北省柏乡县，把全县划分为十三个治疗单位，进行分片治疗，公私医疗部门都把对复员军人疾病医疗工作列入计划。
    去年几个大城市的复员安置工作也都作得较好。仅据北京、天津、上海等八个城市的统计，去年1月到8月份接收的九千五百一十二名复员军人，都已得到了适当安置。对这些复员军人不仅做到了随接收随安置，而且还基本上做到了分配工作适当、级别待遇合理、复员军人满意。
    复员军人在部队中经过了党的长期教育和革命战争的锻炼，绝大多数人复员后都积极参加生产和建设工作，并且能够团结群众积极工作，创造了无数的先进经验和模范事迹。他们成为农业生产和其他建设事业的一支重要力量，许多人并被选为各种基层组织的领导骨干。如河南省的延津、湖南省的湘潭、福建省的福安、青海省的互助土族自治县等十一个县，1956年共安置复员军人一万八千多人，其中担任党支部书记、党支部委员、正副乡长、团支部书记、农业社正副社长等职务的有八千三百三十九人，占复员军人总数的46％。河北省柏乡县有60％以上的复员军人担任乡、村、社等干部。湖南省湘潭县的中南、霞岭、桂花、洪达四个乡，五十三名复员军人都是合作社的骨干。1956年全国各地被评选为县、市级社会主义建设积极分子的复员军人有十二万余人，被评选为省级社会主义建设积极分子的有四千余人。
    在国家建设的其它战线上，复员军人也发挥了很大的作用。我国有许多地质勘探队伍、工程建筑队伍、森林采伐队伍、水利工程队伍以及大型农场，都有复员转业军人参加，或者是以他们作骨干组成的。在我国最大的钢铁基地——鞍钢，就有一万多名复员转业军人在工作。
    在各种生产和工作岗位上，群众普遍反映，复员军人“干活在先，休息在后，战斗是英雄，劳动是模范”。
    复员军人能在各个战线上发挥很大的作用，也是同地方党政机关以及企业、事业部门认真执行党和国家的政策，继续对他们进行培养教育分不开的。河北省抚宁县有复员军人三千三百多人，县委决定从县委委员到一般干部，谁下乡谁必须了解复员军人的安置情况。这就在全县干部和群众中造成了一种关心复员军人的风气。抚宁县在县和乡的工作中，对复员军人热情团结，大胆使用，大大发挥了他们的积极性，使他们在各项工作中都起了显著的作用。大连通用机器厂每次招收员工都按照国务院的决议，优先录用复员军人。复员军人到工厂的时候，厂长亲自向他们介绍厂的情况和生产知识。分配工作后，为了帮助他们尽快掌握业务，有的先被送到业余技术学校学习，大部分人由指定的车间、科、室分工进行培养。对他们的生活情况，厂方也进行了必要的关心和照顾。因此，这个工厂的复员军人一般能很快地掌握生产技术，并涌现出不少劳动模范。这种事例，各省市都有很多。
    为作好复员军人安置工作，去年七、八月间各省市都进行了全面检查。在这次检查中，各地对过去没有处理的某些刁难、排斥复员军人的事件作了处理；处理不当的重新作了处理；对生活有困难的适当给以解决；对患病而无家可归的收入教养院或疗养院。　　1956年复员军人安置工作的成绩是很大的，但也存在着一些问题。目前各地正在按照国务院“关于在1957年春节前后开展拥军优属和拥政爱民工作的通知”，采取教育与解决实际问题相结合的办法进行解决。同时，各地对于安置复员军人好的地区、单位和个人，也正在根据国家规定的奖励办法，分别进行奖励，借以改进复员安置工作。
