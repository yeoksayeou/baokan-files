The County Party Secretary's Worries at Work
    Cheng Kun

    Recently, I went to the countryside in Hunan several times and saw that the county party secretaries there are the busiest people. They spend their days either in meetings or talking to people, without Sundays, and without distinguishing between day and night. Some with fewer solutions are bound by these affairs, and have little time to go to agricultural cooperatives to understand the situation and study problems. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in such counties generally do not fare well. On the other hand, a few people manage to squeeze out some time from these affairs to go deep into agricultural cooperatives to understand the situation and study problems. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in such counties generally do well. Comrade Wang Xiaoliang, the county party secretary of Pingjiang County, belongs to the latter category, and the agricultural cooperatives in Pingjiang County are also doing well. However, the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic is still serious in him.

    First of all, there are too many meetings at the higher level, which prevents them from having enough time to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives for investigation and research. The provincial party committee holds meetings on average once a season, each time taking twenty days to travel back and forth. The prefectural party committee holds meetings on average once a month, each time taking ten days to travel back and forth. After returning from meetings at the higher level, the county party committee has to preside over various meetings to convey and arrange work, each time also requiring five or six days. In this way, a county party secretary has to spend three-quarters of the year in meetings. If things were only like this, it would still be good, but unfortunately it is not limited to this. Now, there are more county-level agencies, a total of more than fifty large and small, and the commercial system alone has nine specialized companies. With more departments, there are also more meetings, and many departments have their own superiors, who are generally also the county's superiors. Therefore, when many higher-level departments hold meetings, they must instruct the attendees to report back to the county party secretary and ask the county party committee for strong support and specific leadership. Many meetings are also designated for the deputy county party secretary to attend. There are particularly many meetings in the financial and economic departments, almost every month, each time taking twenty days to travel back and forth. In 1956, the commercial system alone held seventeen managers' meetings, each time taking more than twenty days to travel back and forth. In this way, the heads of the county's financial and economic departments are often in meetings at the higher level, and have little time to go to the countryside to inspect work, and little time to educate the cadres of their departments. As a result, many serious problems have occurred repeatedly. For example, last year, when the food company dispatched purchasing agents to purchase live pigs in the countryside, many deviations occurred due to the manager being frequently away from home and lacking regular and specific leadership: both large and small pigs were dispatched; those dispatched were purchased, and those not dispatched were also purchased; causing widespread resentment in the countryside, which greatly affected the development of the county's pig raising industry. Now, there are more and more people gambling in the countryside, one of the reasons being that the commercial departments unilaterally regarded dominoes, mahjong, and poker as tools for recreational activities and promoted them in large quantities to the countryside. At present, the majority of cadres who are corrupt and degenerate are in the financial and economic departments. The county party committee cannot ignore this situation, but to manage it, it has to spend a lot of time, and sometimes because there are too many things to do, it is impossible to take care of everything comprehensively.

    There are too many internal documents, sometimes so many that they cannot be read. Therefore, Comrade Wang Xiaoliang had to adopt a method of resistance: he receives more than twenty internal documents every day, and except for looking at some important documents from the provincial and prefectural party committees, he has to leave the rest untouched in the drawer.

    The county party committee is the frontline command post for our party to directly lead the agricultural cooperatives. If, due to our improper working methods, the frontline commander—the county party secretary—is kept busy all day long, it is natural that there will be losses to the work. At the same time, we must also see the other side of the problem. Although those currently serving as secretaries are older comrades, these comrades have not been serving as secretaries for very long, and it is still difficult to lead the agricultural cooperatives of the whole county in production; especially, we must see that the other county party committee leaders besides the secretary are generally newly cultivated after liberation, with high enthusiasm, but less work experience. Therefore, the leadership methods of the relevant higher-level party committees cannot be too generalized. Do not think that once the meetings are held, the documents are issued, and the calls are made, all the work will naturally be implemented among the masses. This is not realistic. At present, what the county party secretaries generally feel is thorny is that the party's work is difficult to implement in the cooperatives. How exactly should this problem be solved? Comrade Wang Xiaoliang has put forward some opinions, which are also the common opinions of the county party secretaries, summarized into three points: First, the prefectural party committee's meetings do not need to be held every month. It is hoped that they can be reduced by a quarter to a third. Some work can be conveyed and arranged by the responsible comrades of the prefectural party committee to each county separately, and stay in the county for a period to see the implementation of these work. In this way, the upper and lower levels will be connected, and the encouragement to the lower levels will also be great. Second, there are too many county-level agencies, and it is hoped that some can be merged. For example, the nine specialized companies in the county can be merged, and several sections can be set up in the county commercial bureau to carry out work at the same time. The three bureaus of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy can also handle affairs by merging into one agricultural bureau. With fewer departments and fewer leaders, it is also easier for the county party committee to grasp, and at the same time, meetings and documents can be reduced. Everyone can concentrate their energy and time on the main work. Third, the internal documents of the provincial and prefectural party committees should be streamlined. It is not necessary for each department to issue them. It is best to concentrate on doing one or two well. With fewer documents, the content may also be more exciting, allowing the county party secretary to have time to read them. The internal documents of the various departments at the provincial and prefectural levels should also adopt this method.

    县委书记工作中的苦恼
    程坤
    最近，我在湖南乡下跑了几次，看见这些地方的县委书记都是最忙的人。他们整天不是开会，就是和人谈话，没有星期天，也不分白天和晚上。有些办法较少的人，就被这些事务把手脚束缚住了，很少有时间到农业社去了解情况，研究问题，因而这类县的农业社一般都搞得不大好。另外有少数的人，硬从这些事务圈子中挤出一些时间，深入农业社去了解情况，研究问题，因而这类县的农业社一般还办得有成绩。平江县委书记王效良同志属于后一类人，平江县的农业社也办得不错，但忙而乱的现象在他身上还是一样的严重。
    首先，上级开会太多，使他们没有充分的时间深入农业社进行调查研究。省委召开的会平均一季一次，每次来回二十天。地委召开的会平均一月开一次，每次来回十天；从上级开会回来，县委又要主持召开各种会议来传达和布置工作，每次也需要五、六天。这样，一年中一个县委书记就要有四分之三的时间开会。事情如果仅仅是这样，那还算好，可惜并不止此。现在，县级机关多了，大小一共有五十多个，商业系统的专业公司就有九个。部门多了，会议也就多了，许多部门都是各有各的上级，一般说来又都是县的上级。因此，许多上级部门开会时，一定要嘱咐开会的人回去向县委书记汇报，要县委大力支持和具体领导。还有许多会议指定要县委副书记参加。财经部门的会议特别多，几乎月月开会，每次来回要二十天。1956年光商业系统就召开经理会议十七次，每次来回也要二十多天。这样，县上财经部门的负责人，就经常在上边开会，很少有时间下乡检查工作，很少有时间对本部门的干部进行教育，于是许多严重的问题就一再发生了。例如，去年食品公司在乡下派购生猪，由于经理经常不在家，缺乏经常具体的领导，发生了很多偏差：大猪也派，小猪也派；派的也购，不派的也购；弄得农村怨声四起，使全县发展生猪事业受到很大的影响。现在，乡下赌钱的越来越多了，原因之一是商业部门片面地把牌九、麻将、扑克当作文娱活动的工具向农村大量推销。目前干部中贪污腐化的以财经部门占大多数。这种情况县委不能不管，但要管起来就不得不花费许多时间，有时因为事情太多，就无法全面照顾了。
    内部文件太多，有时竟多到看不过来的程度。因此，王效良同志只好采取一种抵制的办法：他每天收到的内部文件在二十份以上，除看看省委和地委的一些重要文件外，其余的不得不原封不动地放在抽屉里。
    县委会是我们党直接领导农业社战斗的前线指挥部，如果由于我们的工作方法不当，把前线指挥员——县委书记整天弄得手忙脚乱，对工作会有损失是很自然的。同时我们还要看到问题的另一方面。虽然目前担任书记的都是较老的同志，但这些同志担任书记的时间都不太长，领导全县的农业社从事生产还是感到困难的；尤其要看到除书记以外的几个县委负责同志，一般都是解放后新培养起来的，积极性很高，但工作经验较少，因此，有关上级党委的领导工作方法就不能太一般化。不要以为会开了，文件发下去了，电话也通过了，各项工作就自然会贯彻到群众中去。这是不现实的。目前县委书记普遍感到棘手的，还是党的工作很难贯彻到合作社去。究竟这个问题如何解决呢？王效良同志提出了一些意见，这也是县委书记共同的意见，归纳起来有三条：一、地委的会不必月月开，希望减少四分之一到三分之一。有些工作可由地委负责同志分别到各县传达和布置，并留在县里一个时期，看看这些工作贯彻执行的情况，这样，上下就通气了，对下边的鼓舞也大。二、县级机构太多，希望合并一些。例如，县上九个专业公司可以合并，在县商业局设几个科同时可以进行工作。农、林、水利三局合并成一个农业局也能办事的。部门少了，头头也少了，县委抓起来也比较容易，同时也可以减少会议和文件。大家就可以把精力和时间集中到主要的工作上来。三、省、地委的内部文件应该精简。不必各部都出，最好能集中办好一、二种，数量少了，内容也可能精彩些，让县委书记有时间看。省、专两级各部门的内部文件也应采取这个办法。
