Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th - The second Guangxi Province Folk Art Festival, lasting half a month, concluded yesterday.

　　Of all the performers participating in the festival, more than half were from minority nationalities. The Yao folk song "Yao, Zhuang, and Han Share the Sun," the Miao "Lusheng Caitang Dance," the Zhuang folk song "Qu Qie Liu," the Dong "Lusheng Duet Dance," the Hui "Bathing Dance," and the Han dance "Tea Picking Lantern Dance" were all warmly welcomed by the audience during the performances.

　　The Miao "Lusheng Caitang Dance" was performed by twenty-four people playing and dancing simultaneously, exhibiting a grand and powerful style.

　　"Yao, Zhuang, and Han Share the Sun" is a Yao folk song praising Chairman Mao and national unity. Performed as a mixed duet by Yao elders and young women, it displayed a rare and unique harmony among the nationalities.

　　The Han dance "Tea Picking Lantern Dance," which had been lost for thirty years and is full of joyful emotion, still retained the original style of the tea-picking songs and dances of southern Guangxi after being adapted.

　　Of the two hundred and thirty-four programs performed, about one hundred were newly discovered or created. The conference rewarded seventy-one veteran artists and one hundred and eleven excellent programs.

    广西民间文艺会演中少数民族演员过半
    据新华社南宁16日电　历时半月的广西省第二届民间文艺会演大会，已经在昨天结束。
    参加会演的全部演员中，少数民族演员占了一半以上。瑶族民歌“瑶僮汉共太阳”、苗族的“籚笙采堂舞”、僮族山歌“取切溜”、侗族的“籚笙双人舞”、回族的“沐浴舞”、汉族舞蹈“采茶串灯”等节目，在演出中都受到了观众的热烈欢迎。
    苗族的“籚笙采堂舞”由二十四个人边吹边舞，气魄雄厚。
    “瑶僮汉共太阳”，是歌唱毛主席，歌唱民族大团结的瑶族民歌。由瑶族老艺人和少女混声二重唱，表现出民族中罕有的奇特的和声。
    失传三十年，充满欢乐情绪的汉族舞蹈“采茶串灯”，经过改编之后，仍然保存了桂南采茶歌舞的原有风格。
    在演出的二百三十四个节目中，新发掘和创作的约有一百个。大会奖励了七十一个老艺人和一百一十一个优秀节目。
