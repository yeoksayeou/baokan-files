    New Home
    By Our Staff Reporter Shen Shi
    When moving, Gálesībāi and several Kazakh families from the agricultural cooperative also brought their dismantled yurts to their new homes. How many years had they spent in these yurts! Now that they have new homes, how could they forget these beloved companions? However, unlike previous migrations, the yurts were not set up; they were securely bundled and placed under the eaves. The soot-darkened wooden frames and worn-out felt of the yurts formed a stark contrast to the newly whitewashed walls and painted doors and windows. A dozen kilometers away from the new homes were the original homes of the new residents – farmers of Uyghur, Mongolian, Hui, and Han ethnicities – and the low-lying houses and semi-underground dwellings were also a stark contrast to their new homes.
    Gálesībāi recalled his days living in the yurt. In winter, they would burn a pile of dry firewood and cow dung inside, the thick smoke stinging their eyes. At night, they would lay a few goatskins and a tattered rug on the ground, and the cold wind that crept in through the seams of the yurt would torment them until dawn. Jūmǎbǎikè, the deputy director of the agricultural cooperative, and his younger brother used to live in a semi-underground dwelling in winter. When strong winds blew, the soil covering the dwelling would fall straight down. Now, they have moved into new houses, each room swept clean. When the weather is fine, sunlight streams through the glass windows into the rooms; at night, they light the stove, and the house becomes warm and cozy. The cold wind is blocked by the walls and can no longer invade their home.
    One day, Āwūbākè, the Party branch secretary of the township, came to this new residential area and said to Sūn Yùlín, the director of the cooperative, "Coming here, it feels like entering a farm of the Production and Construction Corps." Indeed, more than twenty houses, built together on what was once a wilderness overgrown with reeds and elm trees, the white walls, red eaves, and blue doors and window frames, set off against the surrounding 4,700 mu of green winter wheat, the more than 10,000 mu of brown soil plowed by tractors, and the high stacks of golden straw near the residences. From a distance, those unaware might think this was a farm of the Production and Construction Corps. Getting closer to the residences, seeing the Uyghur girls wearing floral hats, the Kazakh women in high boots and brightly colored dresses, and the simply dressed Hui, Han, and Mongolian farmers, one realizes that this is not a farm run by the Production and Construction Corps, but the Nongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative near Anjihai in Shawan County, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
    Although this is not a farm of the Production and Construction Corps, the owners of the new residences have a close, harmonious relationship with the local Production and Construction Corps. The well-planned fields, the large and small canals, the newly planted saplings, and the plowed soil all went through the careful consideration of the commanders of the Production and Construction Corps and were the result of the soldiers' labor and sweat.
    In 1950, the soldiers came to the Anjihai area to reclaim wasteland. At that time, they didn't know how to use a hoe or understand the local climate and soil conditions. They asked the farmers for advice, and elderly farmers were hired as production consultants to the troops. When the soldiers learned advanced Soviet experiences and improved their farming techniques, they passed on what they had learned to the farmers, giving them high-quality cotton seeds, and the farm's tractors plowed the land for the farmers. When farmers fell ill, the doctors from the unit treated them. As the Nongfeng Agricultural Cooperative was about to be established, the farm sent a work team to live with the farmers and help build the cooperative. In just seven short years, the seeds of friendship and mutual assistance between the military and the people took firm root.
    The cultivated area of the farms run by the Production and Construction Corps expanded year after year, but the land had never been formally planned. Within the farm's boundaries, more than ninety households of five ethnic groups lived scattered among the fields, their land interspersed with that of the Corps. If the farm was to be planned, it would be necessary to adjust the land with the farmers and relocate them, and before the relocation, it would be necessary to properly resettle them. After the farmers established the agricultural cooperative in 1955, they also felt that the cultivated land was too scattered, making it inconvenient for management. It took a lot of time for the members of the agricultural cooperative to attend a meeting, close ones a few kilometers and far ones more than ten kilometers, and they also hoped that the cooperative's land could be connected into one piece. However, the agricultural cooperative had only been established for a year, and where would it get the financial resources to realize its wish?
    Adjusting the land with the farmers and relocating them was a very meticulous task. Not only must their interests not be harmed, but also their full willingness must be ensured; not only must their current production be considered, but also their future must be taken care of. Among the commanders of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps were veteran Red Army soldiers from those years, heroes who had fought countless battles during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and those who had gloriously participated in the battle to defend Yan'an. They grew up among the people, and how could they not consider the interests of the farmers when adjusting the land with them? The headquarters and Party committee of the Production and Construction Corps instructed all farms that, in the process of land adjustment, they must consult with the local Party committees, governments, and representatives of agricultural cooperatives, and must choose fertile, flat, contiguous land close to water sources for the agricultural cooperatives; when building houses for the relocated farmers, they must respect their customs and habits, and the quality of the houses must not be lower than their original residences.
    After many consultations, the land adjustment work began. In advance, Yú Zhèngdōng, the political commissar of a certain division, and Lāsè’ěrdīng, the deputy secretary of the CPC Shawan County Committee, and others personally went to the wilderness in Anjihai and Wulawusu to select better land for the agricultural cooperative. The water conservancy and wasteland survey and design team planned the land selected for the agricultural cooperative.
    One day, members of the land adjustment team came to the homes of Jūmǎbǎikè and Gálesībāi. They saw that the door of Jūmǎbǎikè's house was low and narrow and asked, "Why is your door made in this form? Is it your habit?"
    "Do we like walking in and out with our heads bowed? Since we can only live in semi-underground dwellings for now, we installed such a door," said Jūmǎbǎikè.
    "What should we pay attention to when building houses for you?"
    "We are believers of Islam, so the new houses should be far away from places where pigs are raised, and the doors should not face west if possible."
    The land adjustment team also brought thirteen types of house blueprints for the members to choose their favorite styles.
    In just one year, the ninety-eight relocated farmers who had adjusted their land all moved into new-style houses. The newly built Anjihai main canal, which is thirty-nine kilometers long, passes through the east side of the Nongfeng Cooperative's land. The water of the Bayingou River is introduced into this canal built of rubble and cobblestones, first irrigating the Nongfeng Cooperative's fields.
    Old man Kǎdá’ěr was hesitant before moving, wasn't he? Jūmǎbǎikè advised him, "Go and see the houses before you decide!" Kǎdá’ěr saw the new residences and the agricultural cooperative's office, saw the housing reserved for him and the firewood piled in front of the door by the soldiers, and he returned satisfied, saying to his son, "Let's move! What else is there to say?" After moving, his son left for Toksun County to get married. The day I went to the Nongfeng Cooperative, Kǎdá’ěr was cleaning up his son's house, preparing to welcome his new daughter-in-law from afar.
    Hui member Bān Fúchéng, a family of nine, moved into four rooms, which was much more spacious than his old house. He led me on a tour of his new home.
    Mongolian member Cháidàn and his young wife lived in two rooms. His wife was very good at managing the household. In the bedroom, the kang was covered with a new blanket bought from the trading company, the floral quilt was folded neatly, and several colorful paintings hung on the wall.
    During my stay in the Nongfeng Cooperative, I saw the accountant rushing to calculate the accounts after the autumn harvest, the women setting off near their old residences to pick up the cotton remaining in the fields, some members using the wood sent by the soldiers to build cattle pens and horse sheds. The Kazakh members with accurate marksmanship were packing ammunition, preparing to go to the grassland not far from Karamay to hunt yellow sheep and pheasants, and Gálesībāi was herding a group of cattle to pasture downstream of the Bayingou River. In my conversations with Āwūbākè and Jūmǎbǎikè, they praised the friendship between the Nongfeng Cooperative and the Production and Construction Corps. (Attached photo)

    新居
    本报记者　沈石
    搬家的时候，加勒司拜和农业社的几户哈萨克人，把拆卸了的蒙古包也带到新的住宅来了。从前，他们在这些蒙古包里度过多少岁月啊！现在他们有了新居，怎能遗忘这些挚爱的伴侣呢？可是这次迁移，不像以往一样，蒙古包没有撑起来，它被捆得好好的搁在屋檐下。那些蒙古包上被烟尘熏染得黝黑的木架和破旧的羊毛毡，比起粉刷得雪白的墙壁和油漆了的门窗来，成了一幅鲜明的对照。离新居十多公里的地方，是新居的主人——杂居着的维吾尔、蒙古、回、汉族农民原来的家，那些低矮的房屋和稍稍露出地面的地窝子，比起他们的新居来，也是一幅鲜明的对照。
    加勒司拜回想他住蒙古包的日子，那时候，每到冬天，蒙古包内烧起一堆干柴和牛粪，浓烟熏得睁不开眼睛。夜里，在地上铺几张山羊皮和一条残破的地毯，一家人便躺在上面，从蒙古包缝隙钻进来的冷风，一直和他们纠缠到天明。农业社的副主任居马拜克和他的弟弟，冬天住地窝子，大风刮来，地窝子上面盖的泥土直往下落。现在他们搬进了新住宅，每间房打扫得干干净净。天晴时，阳光透过玻璃窗直射到房内；晚上，生起火炉，屋子里暖烘烘的。寒风被墙挡住，再也不能侵袭他们了。
    一天，乡上的党支部书记阿吾巴克到了这个新的住宅区，他对社主任孙玉林说：“来到你们这里，好像走进了生产建设部队的农场。”的确，二十多栋住宅，集中地建筑在不久以前还是长满芦苇和榆树的荒原上，白的墙，红的屋檐，蓝的门和窗櫺，衬托着周围四千七百亩绿色的冬麦，衬托着拖拉机翻耕过的一万多亩褐色的土壤，衬托着住宅附近堆得高高的金黄色的稻草垛。从远望去，不知道底细的，可能认为这是生产建设部队的农场。走近住宅跟前，看到那些戴着花帽的维吾尔族姑娘，蹬着长统马靴、穿着鲜艳衣裙的哈萨克妇女，以及打扮得朴素的回、汉、蒙古族农民，才知道这里不是生产建设部队经营的农场，却是新疆维吾尔自治区沙湾县安集海附近的农丰农业生产合作社。
    虽然这不是生产建设部队的农场，新住宅的主人，却和这里的生产建设部队有着水乳般融洽的关系。那规划好了的田地，大大小小的渠道，新栽的树苗，翻耕过的土壤，都经过生产建设部队指挥员周详的考虑，都付出了战士们的劳力和汗水。
    1950年，战士们来到安集海地区开垦荒地。那时候，他们不会使用砍土镘，也不知道这儿的气候、土壤等情况，他们向农民们请教，年老的农民被聘请为部队的生产顾问。当战士们学习苏联先进经验，耕作技术提高之后，他们将自己学得的又转过来教给农民，送给他们优良的棉花种籽，农场的拖拉机给农民犁地。农民有生病的，部队的医生给他们治疗。农丰农业社快成立时，农场已派出工作组，住在农民家里帮助建社。短短的七年，军民之间友爱互助的根苗牢牢地扎下了。
    生产建设部队经营的农场，耕地面积年复一年地扩大，可是土地始终没有经过正式规划。在农场的范围内，杂居着九十多户包括五个民族的农民，他们和部队种的地犬牙交错着。如果规划农场，需要和农民调整土地，让农民迁移，迁移之前，需要很好地安置他们。这里的农民在1955年成立农业社之后，也感到耕地过于分散，不便于经营管理。农业社召集一次会议，社员来回一趟，近的几公里，远的十多公里，耽误许多时间，他们也希望社里的地能连成一片。可是农业社方成立一年，哪有财力实现自己的愿望呢？
    和农民调整土地，让他们迁移，是一项非常细致的工作。不但不能有损他们的利益，还需要他们充分的自愿；不但要考虑他们目前的生产，还需要照顾到将来。新疆军区生产建设兵团的指挥员当中，有的是当年红军的老战士，有的是抗日战争时期身经百战的英雄，有的光荣地参加过保卫延安的战斗。他们从人民中成长起来，在和农民调整土地时，又怎能不考虑到农民的利益呢？生产建设兵团司令部和党委会指示各农场，在调整土地过程中，必须和当地的党委、政府以及农业社的代表协商，必须给农业社选择土质肥沃、平整连片和接近水源的土地；为迁移的农民修建房屋时，必须尊重他们的风俗习惯，房屋的质量不得低于他们原有的住宅。
    经过多次协商，土地调整工作开始了。事先，某师的政治委员鱼正东和中共沙湾县委员会副书记拉色尔丁等亲自到安集海、乌拉乌苏一带的荒原，为农业社选择较好的土地。水利、荒地勘测设计队给农业社择定的土地进行了规划。
    一天，土地调整小组的人来到居马拜克、加勒司拜的家。他们看到居马拜克家的大门又低又窄，问道：“你们的门为什么造成这种形式，是不是习惯这样？”
      “难道我们喜欢低着头走进走出吗？既然目前还只能住地窝子，才安上这样的门。”居马拜克说。
      “给你们修盖房屋，需要注意些什么？”
      “我们是信奉伊斯兰教的，新房屋最好离养猪的地方远些，大门尽可能不朝西开。”
    土地调整小组的人还拿出十三种房屋的图纸来，让社员们挑选中意的样式。
    仅仅一年，调整了土地的九十八户农民，都住上了新式的房屋。新修的长达三十九公里的安集海总干渠，从农丰社土地的东边经过，巴音沟河的水引入了这条用块石和鹅卵石砌成的渠道，首先灌溉着农丰社的田地。
    卡达尔老汉在搬家前，不是犹豫不决吗？居马拜克劝他说：“你去看看房屋再说吧！”卡达尔看到新的住宅和农业社的办公室，看到留给自己的住房和战士们堆在门前的干柴，他满意地回来，对儿子说：“搬吧！还有什么可说的呢？”搬家之后，他儿子动身到托克逊县结婚去了。我到农丰社的那天，卡达尔正在收拾他儿子的住房，准备迎接远道前来的新媳妇。
    回族社员班福成，全家九口人，住上了四间房，比起他的旧宅来宽敞多了。他引着我参观了他的新居。
    蒙古族社员柴旦和他年轻的妻子住着两间房。他妻子很会料理家务，在卧室内，炕上铺着新从贸易公司买回的毛毯，花被子折叠得整整齐齐，墙上挂着几张五彩画。
    我在农丰社逗留期间，看到会计在赶算秋收后的帐目，妇女们出发到她们旧的住宅附近，拾残留在地里的棉花，有的社员用战士们送来的木料在搭盖牛圈和马棚。枪法准确的哈萨克族社员在收拾弹药，准备前往离克拉玛依不远的草原，去猎捕黄羊和野鸡，加勒司拜赶着一群牛，到巴音沟河下游去放牧。我和阿吾巴克、居马拜克交谈中，他们津津地称道农丰社和生产建设部队的友谊。（附图片）
