Some Opinions on Current Literary and Artistic Work
Chen Qitong, Chen Yading, Ma Hanbing, Lu Le

As we comrades joyfully celebrated the New Year, we reviewed the work on the literary and artistic front in 1956. We unanimously believe that the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy put forward by the Party Central Committee has brought new prosperity and boundless creativity to the socialist literary and artistic cause. This is a great blessing for us literary and artistic workers. However, some comments in certain literary and artistic publications are unsatisfactory, and we are willing to frankly raise them for discussion. Although they are immature and there hasn't been time for in-depth theoretical exploration, we are merely raising the issues as a starting point for discussion, but this comes from a sense of responsibility for the socialist literary and artistic cause.

(1) In the past year, the literary and artistic direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the creative method of socialist realism, have been less and less advocated. Some people believe that depicting the themes of workers, peasants, and soldiers is too narrow, attempting to replace the literary and artistic direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with a "broad themes theory." Some people believe that the country has entered a new period of socialist construction and only needs to emphasize "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers can be dispensed with. Some people believe that since the creative method of socialist realism is not the only one, it is not necessary to adhere to it, and even think that socialist realism is not necessarily correct. The socialist realism creative method, which has always been considered correct and has guided us in creating many excellent works, has not only generated wavering, but also the feeling that such a proposition and its interpretation are dogmatic, bringing constraints to our artistic creativity and creating formulaic conceptualization. Therefore, they attempt to abolish "socialism," only mentioning "realism," or replacing it with the vague concept of "realism in the socialist era." We believe that this skepticism and abolitionism are products of petty-bourgeois artistic thought. Under the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, different artistic thoughts and creative methods can be allowed to exist, but as a Party literary and artistic worker, one must adhere to and promote the literary and artistic direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the creative method of socialist realism, because it may not be correct for everyone, but it is the only correct one for us. Under the slogan of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," we should not abandon it, but adhere to it; we should not remain silent or even echo certain skeptics and abolitionists, but should raise our own clear banner, hold the position, and conduct the struggle. Otherwise, it would not be "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," but the socialist literary and artistic ranks automatically and passively lowering their flags and ceasing fire.

(2) In the past year, the opposition to "formulaism and conceptualization" has been carried out vigorously and has achieved certain results, which should be affirmed. "Formulaism and conceptualization" should be opposed, because it causes ideological rigidity and artistic decline for us literary and artistic workers, and this is also correct. However, there are some unclear boundaries in the opposition, so the struggle against "formulaism and conceptualization" has been misinterpreted or used by some people as an excuse to oppose art serving politics, art having a high degree of ideological content, and art being a weapon to educate the broad masses of the people, intentionally or unintentionally opposing "formulaism and conceptualization" with political struggle. It seems that as long as one talks about the ideological content of literature and art, analyzes the educational role of certain works from a political perspective, or writes about themes with greater political significance, they will all be called "formulaism and conceptualization." What are the results? Some writers dare not write about themes that truly reflect the current major political struggles, and very few people promote them anymore. A large number of domestic affairs, love stories, adventure stories, etc., have replaced novels, dramas, and poems that depict the earth-shaking social changes, the earth-shattering liberation struggles, and the respectable and emulable heroic figures that are sufficient to educate the people and inspire the people. Therefore, the combat effectiveness of literature and art has weakened, the face of the times has become blurred, the voice of the times has become low, and the brilliance of socialist construction has dimmed in the mirror of literature and art. Even some essays have lost their direction. In some publications, works reflecting the brilliance of socialist construction, this main aspect, have gradually decreased, and satirical articles full of dissatisfaction and disappointment have increased. Of course, satire is also needed, but failing to draw a clear line between maintaining the socialist system and attacking the socialist system will be untrue, one-sided, and harmful. We oppose "formulaism and conceptualization," but we must distinguish between the ideological content of literature and art and "formulaism and conceptualization," and we must distinguish between insufficient artistic processing, the author's lack of ability to express themselves, and "formulaism and conceptualization." Otherwise, opposing everything will negate "politics" and negate the enthusiasm for reflecting the current major political struggles, falling into the circle of vulgarity, depicting personal trivialities, and expressing personal emotions. We should not think that "less politics" can avoid "formulaism and conceptualization." A writer must always have full political enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility to the people.

(3) The "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy has allowed our literature and art to release some lovely flowers in the past year, which is undeniable. But only a hundred flowers can bloom together, not just one kind of flower, and the most important of these should be new, socialist realist flowers blooming in the soil of the people's new lives. The problem starts here. Since the proposal of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," many people have only been keen on rummaging through old boxes, keen on taking shortcuts to adapt old works, and even a few individuals have slightly sorted out the valuable heritage left by their ancestors and crowned it with their own names to seek fame and fortune. Of course, it is very necessary to carry forward our national artistic heritage and enrich the repertoire, but we cannot think that this is the best and this is the entirety of our artistic flowers. On the contrary, creating new, socialist artistic flowers on the basis of national art should always be our primary task. Old flowers may not wither, but new flowers are more vital. This kind of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" that only pays attention to blooming old flowers and not paying attention to blooming new flowers, and not paying attention to cultivating and protecting new flowers, is not completely normal. Therefore, in "Let a hundred flowers bloom," we should still focus on promoting the creation of new flowers and the opening of new flowers. New flowers may not be beautiful as soon as they bloom, and may not be brightly colored or have complete branches and leaves, but after all, these are flowers with the greatest hope and new vitality.

These are some of our thoughts when recalling 1956, and we frankly put them forward here for everyone's comments.

    我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见
    陈其通　陈亚丁　马寒冰　鲁　勒
    我们几个同志在欢度新年的时候，回顾了一下1956年在文学艺术战线上的工作，一致认为党中央提出的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，给社会主义的文学艺术事业带来了新的繁荣和无限的创造性，这对我们文学艺术工作者来讲是一种莫大的幸福。但在目前有一些文艺刊物上的一些评论，是不能令人满意的，我们愿意坦率地提出来讨论，虽然不成熟，也还来不及作深入的理论探讨，而只是把问题提出来，作为抛砖引玉，但这却是出自对社会主义文学艺术事业的责任感。
      （一）在过去的一年中，为工农兵服务的文艺方向和社会主义现实主义的创作方法，越来越很少有人提倡了。有些人认为描写工农兵题材太狭窄，企图用“题材广泛论”来代替为工农兵服务的文艺方向；有些人认为国家已进入社会主义建设的新时期，只需要强调“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，为工农兵服务的方向就可以不必强调了。有些人认为社会主义现实主义的创作方法既然不是唯一的，也就不必坚持了，甚至认为社会主义现实主义未必正确。对于一向认为正确而且一向指导着我们创作了不少优秀作品的社会主义现实主义创作方法，不仅产生了动摇，而且觉得这样提法和对它的解释是教条主义的，给我们艺术的创造性带来了束缚，造成了公式化概念化，因此，就企图取消“社会主义”，只提“现实主义”，或者用“社会主义时代的现实主义”这一模糊的概念来代替它。我们认为这种怀疑论和取消论是小资产阶级艺术思想的产物。在党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针下，可以允许不同的艺术思想与创作方法存在，但作为一个党的文艺工作者必须坚持和宣传为工农兵服务的文艺方向和社会主义现实主义的创作方法，因为它不一定对一切人都是正确的，而对我们却是唯一正确的。在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的口号下，不是放弃它，而是要坚持它，不是对某些怀疑论者、取消论者默不做声，甚至随声附和，而是应该高举起自己鲜明的旗帜，压住阵脚进行斗争，否则，那就不是“百家争鸣”，而是社会主义的文学艺术队伍自动地、消极地掩旗息鼓了。
      （二）过去的一年中一直在大张旗鼓地反对“公式化、概念化”，并且也有一定的成绩，这是应该肯定的；“公式化、概念化”应该反对，因为它给我们文艺工作者造成思想的僵化和艺术的衰退，这也是对的。但在反对的中间却有些界线不清的地方，因此，使反对“公式化、概念化”的斗争，被一些人误认为或者利用来反对艺术应为政治服务、艺术要有高度思想性、艺术应作为教育广大人民的武器的借口，有意无意地把“公式化、概念化”与政治斗争对立起来了。好像只要一谈文学艺术的思想性，一从政治上去分析某些作品的教育作用，一写具有较大政治意义的主题，就都要被称为“公式化、概念化”。结果如何呢？真正反映当前重大政治斗争的主题有些作家不敢写了，也很少有人再提倡了，大量的家务事、儿女情、惊险故事等等，代替了描写翻天复地的社会变革、惊天动地的解放斗争、令人尊敬和效法的英雄人物的足以教育人民和鼓舞人心的小说、戏剧、诗歌，因此，使文学艺术的战斗性减弱了，时代的面貌模糊了，时代的声音低沉了，社会主义建设的光辉在文学艺术这面镜子里光彩暗淡了。甚至使有些小品文失去了方向，在有些刊物上反映社会主义建设的光辉灿烂的这个主要方面的作品逐渐少起来了，充满着不满和失望的讽刺文章多起来了；当然，讽刺也需要的，但不划清维护社会主义制度和打击社会主义制度的界线，就会是不真实的、片面的和有害的。我们反对“公式化、概念化”，但是，必须把文学艺术的思想性与“公式化、概念化”分清楚，必须把艺术加工不够、作者表现能力不足和“公式化、概念化”分清楚，否则一律反对，就会把“政治”反掉，把反映当前重大政治斗争的热情反掉，落入庸俗的、描写个人的生活琐事和抒发个人感情的圈子里去。我们不要以为“政治”少了就可以避免“公式化、概念化”，一个作家任何时候都必须有饱满的政治热情和对人民的责任感。
      （三）“百花齐放”的方针使我们的文学艺术在过去一年中放出了一些令人喜爱的花朵，这是不可否认的。但只有百花才能齐放，而不只是某一种花，其中最主要的又应该是新的、社会主义现实主义的、在人民新的生活的土壤上开出的花朵。问题就开始在这里发生了，自从提出“百花齐放”以后，有许多人只热衷于翻老箱底，热衷于走捷径去改编旧的，甚至有个别人把老祖宗留下的宝贵遗产稍加整理就冠上自己的名字去图名求利。当然，发扬我们的民族艺术遗产，充实上演剧目是十分需要的，但不能认为这就是最好的，这就是我们艺术花朵的全部，反之在民族艺术的基础上创造新的、社会主义艺术之花任何时候都应该是我们的首要工作。老花虽不败，新花则更有生命力，这种只注意开老花不注意开新花，不注意去培植和保护新花的“百花齐放”是不完全正常的。因此，在“百花齐放”中，还是应该以提倡创造新花为主，开放新花为主。新花不一定一开就美，也可能色彩不艳，枝叶不全，但毕竟这是具有最大希望和新的生命力的花朵。
    这就是我们回忆1956年的一些感想，在这里坦率地提出来就教于大家。
