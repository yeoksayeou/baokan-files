    “Now we must talk about democracy…”
    In the Cheren Agricultural Production Cooperative of Rongjiang County, Guizhou Province, there are many problems in the field management of overwintering crops, but the cooperative's leaders are not actively leading the members to solve them. Some members of this cooperative do not pay attention to the quality of their work, and the leaders do not stop them. According to these leaders, now we must talk about democracy, and we must oppose coercion and commandism. They cannot treat the members with harsh administrative orders, nor can they deduct work points. Therefore, they feel that they have no way to lead.
    A production team leader of the Sancha Township Agricultural Cooperative in Zunyi County of this province sent members to deliver public grain, and some members said: "Now we talk about democracy, I will do it if I agree, and if I don't agree, forget it!"
    Obviously, they have not really understood what democracy is all about, and they completely oppose promoting democracy and strengthening leadership.
    We should do more to help those cooperative leaders who are not good at using the mass line to learn how to correctly promote democracy, so that after abandoning coercion and commandism, they will not abandon or weaken their leadership responsibilities, but happily enhance their sense of responsibility.
    We should educate those members who misunderstand democracy and do not want leadership, so that they can learn to correctly exercise their democratic rights, respecting both their own democratic rights and the management authority of the management personnel. Every farmer who has a real sense of pride in being the master of his own affairs should cherish the cooperative, this close-knit family, and cherish the leaders who work for everyone.

    “现在要讲民主了……”
    贵州省榕江县车仁农业生产合作社的越冬作物田间管理工作中有很多问题，但合作社领导人员不去积极领导社员解决。这个社里有些社员做活不顾质量，领导人员也不制止。据这些领导人员说，现在要讲民主了，要反对强迫命令了，既不能用严厉的行政命令来对待社员，又不能扣工分。因此，他们感到没有办法领导。
    这个省的遵义县三岔乡农业社的一个生产队长派社员送公粮，有的社员说：“现在讲民主，我同意就干，不同意就算！”
    很显然，他们还没有真正懂清楚民主是怎么回事，他们把发扬民主和加强领导完全对立起来了。
    应该多多帮助那些不善于运用群众路线的合作社领导人员学会正确地发扬民主，使他们在抛弃强迫命令以后，不是放弃或削弱自己的领导责任，而是愉快地增强自己的责任感。
    应该教育那些误解民主、不要领导的社员，使他们学会正确地行使自己的民主权利，既尊重自己的民主权利，也尊重管理人员的管理职权。每一个有着真正当家作主的自豪感的农民，都应该爱护合作社这个亲密的大家庭，爱护为大家办事的领导人员。
