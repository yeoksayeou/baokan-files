    The Tianqiao Market is always packed with people, bustling and noisy. The gongs and drums from the theater, the cries of snack vendors, and the eloquent explanations of the peep show operators... all mingled together.
    We finished watching the acrobatics performance in the open air, and it was almost dusk. Several Soviet writers, including Polevoi, were reluctant to leave this flavorful and very casual environment, so we strolled around the market again.
    On a street facing the sun, an old man selling radishes was squatting. In the basket in front of him, there was a radish, carved to look like a red peony with dewdrops.
      "Radishes better than pears! Taste before you buy, no crispness, no money!" the old man called out, his voice hoarse. As usual, I translated everything I saw and heard to Comrade Polevoi.
    "Let's go buy two!" Polevoi, who was interested in everything in the lives of the Chinese people, suggested happily, "Green-skinned, red-hearted radishes are already tempting enough, especially after hearing such sincere and noble words!"
    The old man selling radishes was at least sixty years old. It was probably the first time in his life that foreigners had come to buy his radishes. He was a little surprised, but the Soviet writer's kind and amiable attitude immediately infected him. Just as Polevoi was about to pay, the old man suddenly asked:
      "This is a Soviet elder brother, right?!" I nodded. The old man immediately added, "Tell him, China and the Soviet Union are like one family, no need to pay, give it to him to eat, it's nothing!" The old man grasped Polevoi's arm with his wrinkled, thick hand and shook it twice. He probably wanted to use this action to help himself express what was in his heart.
    Judging from the old man's patched cotton-padded trousers and jacket, his life was not prosperous, but from his full spirit and firm tone, people could believe the sincerity of his generous gift. The old man selling radishes felt proud to be able to entertain Soviet guests as a Chinese citizen!
    Polevoi refused to accept the gift, although the price was not expensive, it was the old man's source of livelihood.
      "Then let's do this," the old man said, seeing the camera on Polevoi's body, speaking like an old friend, "Take a picture of me, that will fulfill my wish." He immediately stood up, baring his chest, and grinning so much that his lips could barely cover his few remaining teeth. His whole face and body glowed with an indescribable radiance in the afterglow of the setting sun. "I am old, I can't go to the Soviet Union anymore. If you take a picture of me, I will go to the Soviet Union in the picture, and then my eyes will see the happiest country in the world!"
    People had already surrounded us in layers, packed tightly. After hearing the old man selling radishes' earnest words, they automatically cleared a space so that this Soviet comrade could take this photo well, capturing the same wish that the old man and everyone else held.
    The bustling market suddenly became quiet, so quiet that you could even hear the sound of the camera taking a picture.
      "Old man, thank you for your kindness. The Soviet people will always be the most reliable brothers and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people!" Polevoi said excitedly.
    The old man selling radishes and the famous Soviet writer held hands tightly in the market for a long time. The people around held their breath, seemingly afraid of disturbing this atmosphere of meaningful friendship.
    I don't know if my eyes were wet, but I seemed to see two bright, crystalline tears in both of their eyes.

    卖萝卜老人的心愿
    乌兰汗
    天桥市场总是人山人海，熙熙攘攘。剧场里的锣鼓声，卖零食的吆喝声，拉洋片的滔滔不绝的讲解声……都交织在一起了。
    我们在露天下看完了杂技表演，天已接近黄昏。波列伏依等几位苏联作家舍不得离开这个饶有风味并且非常随便的环境，所以我们就信步又在市场里逛起来了。
    在一个朝阳的街头上，蹲着一个卖萝卜的老人。摆在他面前的筐里，有一个萝卜，削得活像一朵含着露水的红牡丹。
      “萝卜赛梨哟！先尝后买，不脆不要钱！”老人拖着嘶哑的嗓门在招唤顾客。我照例把目见耳闻的每件事都翻译给波列伏依同志。
    “走，咱们买两个！”对中国人民生活中一切事物都感兴趣的波列伏依，快活地建议说：“绿皮红心的萝卜本来已经很诱惑人了，何况再听到这么诚挚高贵的话呢！”
    卖萝卜的老人足有六十岁。外国人前来买他的萝卜，也许是生平遇到的第一次。他有些诧异，可是苏联作家的亲切和蔼的态度，立刻感染了他。等波列伏依正准备付钱时，老人突然开口问道：
      “这位是苏联老大哥吧？！”我点了点头。老人立刻加上了一句：“你告诉他，中苏两国活像一家人，不用给钱了，送给他吃吧，小意思！”老人用那双布满皱纹的粗壮的手，握住了波列伏依的胳膊，抖了两下，他大概想借这个动作来帮助自己表达内心的话。
    从老人身上那套满是补绽的棉裤棉袄上看来，他的生活并不富裕，可是从他那饱满的精神、坚定的语气里，人们可以相信他慷慨赠礼的诚心。卖萝卜的老人为自己作为一个中国公民来招待苏联客人，而感到自豪！
    波列伏依不肯接受这个礼物，虽然价格不贵，但是对于一个卖萝卜的老人来说，它是他的生活来源。
      “那么这样办吧，”老人看见了波列伏依身上背的照像机，像对老朋友似的说道：“您给我拍张照片，这就满足我的心愿。”他随即站起来，袒露着胸际，嘻笑得嘴唇已经遮不住他那仅剩几颗的牙齿了。他的全脸、全身都在夕阳的余辉里，焕发出一种难于表达的光彩。“我已经老了，去不成苏联了。你把我拍成照片，我就会在照片上去到苏联，那时，我的眼睛就会看见天下最幸福的国家了！”
    人们早就把我们密密层层地包围得水泄不通。他们听了卖萝卜老人的这一席恳切的话，都自动地闪出一块空地来，让这位苏联同志能很好地拍下这张照片，拍下老人跟大家所抱的同样的一个心愿。
    熙熙攘攘的市场，突然静了，静得甚至可以听见照像机拍片的声音。
      “老爷子，谢谢你的好意。苏联人民永远是中国人民最可靠的兄弟和战友！”波列伏依激动地说。
    卖萝卜老人和苏联著名作家在市场上久久地、紧紧地握着手。周围的人都屏息了呼吸，似乎唯恐扰乱了这片意味深长的友情的氛围。
    我不晓得是否我的眼睛湿润了，但，我仿佛在他们两人的眼眶里看到了两粒明晶的泪珠。
