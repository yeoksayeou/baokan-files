Xinhua News Agency, January 5th—The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a notice on December 28, 1956, regarding carrying out revolutionary tradition education for youth.

The notice stated that in the extremely arduous and complex struggle to realize our country's socialist industrialization, educating youth to inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition and encouraging them to work selflessly for the construction of socialism is a regular and important task in the ideological education work of the Youth League. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the League requests that the propaganda departments of the League committees in various regions, especially in large and medium-sized cities, select a suitable time in the first half of 1957 (such as around the Spring Festival or around the "May Fourth" Movement) to conduct a revolutionary tradition education for youth, and carry out various activities around this central theme.

Revolutionary tradition education for youth should focus on promoting the ideas of hard work and plain living, building the country through diligence and thrift, and wholeheartedly serving the people, promoting revolutionary heroism and optimism, and maintaining a high degree of patriotism and vigorous revolutionary spirit. When conducting this education, special attention should be paid to using vivid, concrete, and figurative educational methods, educating young people through the history of revolutionary struggles and the deeds of heroic figures; paying attention to combining the actual situation in the local area and the thinking of young people, and guiding young people to participate in the current actual struggle through this education; paying attention to combining the past struggles of the local people and carrying out activities with local characteristics. While conducting this education, we should still earnestly care for the lives of young people and solve problems that should and can be solved. We must not allow bureaucratic individuals who do not care about the lives of young people to use the demand that young people work hard as an excuse.

The ways to carry out this education should be diverse. Lectures and report meetings can be held to explain the deeds of revolutionary struggles and heroes and martyrs to young people, and to publicize the significance of inheriting and carrying forward the revolutionary tradition; recommend and organize young people to read relevant books, watch relevant movies, and promote relevant songs and dramas; visit the sites of various revolutionary historical sites, museums, and exhibition rooms, and visit the families of revolutionary martyrs and patriots and veteran soldiers who participated in the struggle. Rural League organizations can organize young people to read and discuss relevant articles and materials published in League newspapers and periodicals, visit local revolutionary historical sites, visit veteran revolutionary fighters, and ask them to tell stories of revolutionary struggles.

    青年团中央宣传部发出通知
    教育青年发扬光荣的革命传统
    新华社5日讯　中国新民主主义青年团中央宣传部在1956年12月28日发出关于向青年进行革命传统教育的通知。
    通知中说，在实现我国社会主义工业化这一极其艰巨复杂的斗争中，教育青年继承和发扬光荣的革命传统，鼓舞他们为建设社会主义而忘我地劳动，是青年团思想教育工作中一项经常的、重要的任务。团中央宣传部要求各地团委宣传部门，特别是大、中城市团委宣传部门，在1957年上半年内选择一适当时机（如春节前后、“五四”前后等），向青年进行一次革命传统教育，围绕这个中心开展各种活动。
    向青年进行革命传统教育，应着重宣传艰苦朴素、勤俭建国和全心全意为人民服务的思想，发扬革命英雄主义和乐观主义精神，保持高度爱国热情和蓬勃的革命朝气。在进行这项教育的时候，应特别注意运用生动、具体和形象化的教育方法，通过革命斗争的历史和英雄人物的事迹来教育青年；注意结合当地的实际情况和青年的思想，通过这项教育引导青年参加当前的实际斗争；注意结合本地人民过去斗争的情况，开展有本地特点的活动。在进行这项教育的同时，仍应切实关心青年生活，解决应当而又可能解决的问题，决不能因为要求青年艰苦奋斗，而给不关心青年生活的官僚主义者以借口。
    进行这个教育的方式应该是多种多样的。可举办讲座和报告会，向青年讲解革命斗争和英雄、烈士的事迹，宣传继承和发扬革命传统的意义；推荐和组织青年阅读有关书籍，观看有关电影，推广有关歌曲和戏剧；参观各种革命史迹的遗址、博物馆和陈列室，访问革命烈士、志士的家属和参加过斗争的老战士等。农村团的组织，可组织青年阅读和讨论团报、团刊发表有关的文章和资料，参观当地的革命史迹，访问革命老战士并请他们讲革命斗争的故事。
