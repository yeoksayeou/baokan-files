    Hunan Province has abundant mountain stream water resources that can be utilized. It is planned to build thirty small hydroelectric power stations from the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957. The generated electricity can be used to pump water to irrigate 59,500 mu of farmland. Xinhua News Agency reporter Ke Shanwen photographed.
