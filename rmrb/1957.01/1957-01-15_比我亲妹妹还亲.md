	"Closer than my own sister"
	Anyone who goes to the hardware and electrical appliance section of the Qiqihar City United Store can see a kind and amiable salesperson. Her name is Zhang Shuying. She always patiently and sincerely introduces products to customers and tries to help them in every way possible. One day, a customer bought a mirror for his wedding from the second floor. As he walked to the door, it was raining heavily outside. He was afraid of getting the mirror wet and hesitated to leave. Seeing this, Zhang Shuying lent him a piece of cloth and a piece of oil paper to wrap the mirror, and also found a cardboard box to pack it in. The customer said gratefully, "Thank you so much, this is wonderful!"
	Once, a female customer came to buy something. At this time, Zhang Shuying noticed that the customer's face suddenly turned pale and she was walking unsteadily. She hurriedly came out from behind the counter to help her upstairs. Just as they reached the middle of the stairs, the customer fainted. Fearing that the customer would fall down the stairs, she held her tightly. When the customer woke up, she said gratefully, "You are so kind-hearted, even closer than my own sister!" Zhang Shuying let her sit down in a chair to rest and then took the initiative to buy the things she needed for her and hired a pedicab to take the customer home. Her behavior moved the surrounding customers.
	A long time passed, and Zhang Shuying had already forgotten about this incident. Unexpectedly, on August 6th, the female customer who had received her care, along with her husband, three children, and her elderly mother, came all the way from Nenjiang. She grabbed Zhang Shuying's hand and thanked her emotionally, and then introduced her to her husband and mother, who also thanked Zhang Shuying repeatedly, and prepared to give Zhang Shuying some gifts. Because Zhang Shuying repeatedly declined, the family reluctantly said goodbye to Zhang Shuying. ·Yan Jun·

    “比我亲妹妹还亲”
    谁走到齐齐哈尔市联营商店五金电料组的柜台前边，都可以看到一位和霭可亲的营业员。她的名字叫张淑英。她一贯耐心诚恳的向顾客介绍商品，处处想办法帮顾客的忙，一天，一位顾客从二楼买了一块结婚用的镜子，当他走到门口的时候，外边正下着大雨；他怕把镜子弄湿了，不敢走。张淑英看到这种情景，就借给他一块布和一张油纸，把镜子包上，又找个纸盒给装起来。这位顾客感动地说：“谢谢你，这可太好啦！”
    有一次，一位女顾客来买东西。这时张淑英发现这位顾客脸色忽然苍白起来，走起路来也踉踉跄跄的，就急忙从柜台里走出来搀扶着她上楼，刚走到楼梯中间，顾客就晕过去了，她怕顾客摔下楼去，就紧紧地把她抱住，等顾客苏醒过来的时候，感激地说：“你这人心肠真好哇，比我亲妹妹还亲。张淑英让她坐到椅子上休息后，便主动替这位顾客买了所需的东西。并替顾客雇了一辆三轮车回家。她这种行为感动了周围的顾客。
    事情过去好久，张淑英已经忘了这件事。没想到8月6日那天，那位曾经受过她照顾的女顾客和她的爱人并带着三个小孩和她的老母亲从老远的嫩江赶来了。她拉住张淑英的手激动地说着感谢的话，并先后向她爱人，母亲做了介绍，他们也连连向张淑英道谢，并准备送给张淑英一些礼物。由于张淑英一再婉言谢绝，这家人才难舍难离地和张淑英告别了。　·阎军·
