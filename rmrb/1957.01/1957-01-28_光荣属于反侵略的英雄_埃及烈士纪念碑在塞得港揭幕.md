Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 26th - According to TASS, a memorial ceremony was held in Port Said on January 25th, the day for commemorating Egyptian patriots, to honor the heroic spirit shown by the residents of Port Said during the Anglo-French imperialist aggression. At the same time, the unveiling ceremony of the monument to the martyrs who died defending the Suez Canal in 1952 was also held.

On January 25, 1952, Egyptian patriots engaged in a heroic battle in Ismailia to defend the Suez Canal. Many patriots were massacred by British colonialists. Therefore, this day has since been commemorated as a day of struggle against imperialism and for freedom and independence.

Egyptian Interior Minister Zakaria Mohieddin delivered a speech at the memorial ceremony in Port Said, calling on the Egyptian people to learn from the past, be vigilant, and be ready to repel any new conspiracies by imperialism to infringe upon Egypt's freedom and independence. He called on the people to maintain and strengthen the unity forged in the struggle against imperialist aggression.
