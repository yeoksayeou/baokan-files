    (Our report) The winter production achievements in the Xingtai Special District of Hebei Province have surpassed those of the winter of 1955, the high tide of the cooperative movement.
    When carrying out winter production, agricultural cooperatives in this special district generally paid attention to starting with summarizing production, affirming achievements, commending advanced individuals, and encouraging the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to continue advancing on the socialist road. In terms of manure accumulation, the entire district completed 8.1 billion jin in the winter of 1955, and had completed 9.5 billion jin by the end of December 1956. In terms of wheat field management, 436,772 mu were top-dressed in the winter of 1955, and 500,000 mu were top-dressed in the winter of 1956. 682,322 mu of wheat were hoed in the winter of 1955, and 1.05 million mu of wheat were hoed in the winter of 1956. In terms of pig raising, the number increased to 137,291 in the winter of 1955, and to more than 230,000 in the winter of 1956. In terms of afforestation, more than 26,246 mu were completed in the winter of 1955, with 668,230 trees planted, and 36,757 mu were completed in the winter of 1956, with more than 2.03 million trees planted. In terms of farmland water conservancy construction, none was carried out before the end of 1955, and it only started in January 1956, while last winter it started as early as October, and the completed figures are also quite large.
    At present, the agricultural cooperatives in this special district are still actively engaged in winter production, preparing for spring plowing.

    本报讯　河北省邢台专区冬季生产的成绩，已经超过了1955年冬天合作化运动高潮中的生产成绩。
    这个专区的农业社在开展冬季生产的时候，一般都注意了从总结生产入手，肯定成绩，表扬先进，鼓舞了广大农民在社会主义道路上继续前进的积极性。在积肥方面，1955年冬季全区完成八十一亿斤，1956年12月底已完成九十五亿斤。在麦田管理方面，1955年冬施追肥四十三万六千七百七十二亩，1956年冬施追肥五十万亩。1955年冬锄麦六十八万二千三百二十二亩，1956年冬锄麦一百零五万亩。在养猪方面，1955年冬发展到十三万七千二百九十一头，1956年冬发展到二十三万多头。在造林方面，1955年冬完成两万六千二百四十六亩多，植树六十六万八千二百三十株，1956年冬完成三万六千七百五十七亩，植树二百零三万多株。在兴修农田水利方面，1955年年底以前没有进行，到1956年1月份才开始，而去年冬季从10月份就开始了，完成的数字也相当大。
    目前，这个专区的农业社仍在积极进行冬季生产，准备春耕。
