Thrift Cannot Be a "Gust of Wind"
    Lǐ Qiàn
    Since the Sanqiao Vehicle Repair Factory in Xi'an City launched the production increase and thrift movement in late October 1956, workers have devised many methods for collecting and utilizing waste and used materials. This has not only reversed the previous situation of monthly losses but has also generated tens of thousands of yuan in profit each month since October.
    Although the workers' morale was high during the production increase and thrift movement, they were dissatisfied with the factory leadership's practice of only calling on everyone to engage in production increase and thrift movements at the end of each year. The factory usually doesn't mention thrift, and nobody knows whether the factory is making a profit or a loss, so nobody pays attention to thrift. Only in the fourth quarter does the leadership announce how much money has been lost, call on everyone to be thrifty, and assign thrift tasks to each workshop or team. By the end of the year, when the profit plan is completed, everyone relaxes, and at the beginning of the following year, nobody cares about production increase and thrift anymore. This was the case in 1954, as well as in 1955 and 1956. For example, in the first half of 1955, the factory only completed 15% of its annual profit plan. At the end of the third quarter, a production increase and thrift movement was launched, and more than fifty specific thrift measures were formulated, resulting in the overfulfillment of the annual profit plan. However, after 1956 began, nobody paid attention to the previously stipulated thrift measures, and waste began to increase again. The 1955 thrift plan stipulated that old parts and waste materials removed from repaired vehicles must be properly stored in fixed locations; unused materials must be returned. Everyone did this during the 1955 production increase and thrift movement. However, from the first to the third quarter of 1956, waste materials were again thrown everywhere. During the 1955 thrift movement, each workshop cleaned up its small warehouse, clearing out materials worth 80,000 yuan, which led to the establishment of stricter material requisition systems. However, in 1956, small warehouses reappeared in each workshop.
    Because the factory leadership treated the production increase and thrift movement as a crash campaign, the work was not only unsustainable but also impossible to carry out in depth. The Sanqiao Vehicle Repair Factory is a repair factory, and materials account for a large proportion of the cost. Therefore, the leadership focused on saving materials in each production increase and thrift movement. This is certainly correct. However, this is only one aspect of thrift. The factory still has many problems in other areas. For example, rework and scrap often occur in vehicle repair, machine repair, and parts production, resulting in significant waste. Therefore, quality issues should be emphasized in these workshops. However, because the leadership's work is not thorough and they have not specified concrete thrift goals based on the specific situation of each workshop, the cadres and workers in these workshops, in order to complete their tasks and unable to find the key to thrift for a while, also started collecting waste materials. As a result, although a lot of waste materials were collected, product quality did not improve, and rework and scrap waste remained high.
    How should the production increase and thrift movement be carried out? The party and administrative leaders of the factory are conducting research, but they are still focused on how to block the waste of materials. As for how to improve product quality and how to carry out the production increase and thrift movement in a sustained and comprehensive manner, they have not yet conducted further in-depth research to come up with a solution.

### 节约不能“一阵风”

    节约不能“一阵风”
    李茜
    西安市三桥车辆修理厂自1956年10月下旬开展增产节约运动以来，工人们在收集和利用废旧材料方面想了很多办法，不但扭转了过去月月赔钱的局面，而且从10月份起，月月都获得几万元的利润。
    在增产节约运动中，职工们的情绪虽然很高，但是他们对于工厂的领导上每到年底才号召大家搞增产节约运动的作法是不满意的。这个厂平时不提节约，工厂是赔是赚大家都不知道，因此对节约也不注意。一到第四季度，领导上才向大家宣布赔了多少钱，号召大家节约，给每个车间或小组分配节约任务。到年底，利润计划完成了，也就松了劲，第二年年初，就再也没有人过问增产节约问题了。这个厂1954年是这样，1955年和1956年也是这样。如1955年上半年，这个厂仅仅完成全年利润计划的15％，第三季度末开展了增产节约运动，制订了五十多条具体节约措施，结果超额完成了全年的利润计划。可是1956年开始以后，过去规定的节约措施没有人管了，浪费现象就又开始增长。1955年节约方案中规定修理车辆拆下来的旧零件和废旧材料必须规定固定地点妥善保管；用不完的材料，必须办理退料手续。1955年开展增产节约运动时，大家都是这样做的。但是，1956年一至三季度，废旧材料又被扔得到处都是。1955年搞节约运动时，各车间清理了一次小仓库，共清理出来价值八万元的材料，因此还规定了较严格的领料制度。但是，1956年各车间又出现了小仓库。
    由于这个厂的领导上把增产节约运动当成一个突击性的运动，工作不仅不能持久，而且也不可能深入。三桥车辆修理厂是个修理厂，材料在成本中占很大比重，因此，领导上在每次增产节约运动中都抓节约材料问题。这当然是对的。但是，这仅仅是节约的一个方面，这个厂在其他方面也还存在着许多问题。如在修车、修机和生产配件方面，经常发生返工报废现象，浪费也很大，因此，在这些车间里就应该强调质量问题。但是，由于领导上工作不深入，没有根据各车间的具体情况指出具体的节约目标。这些车间的干部和工人为了完成任务，又一时找不到节约的关键，于是就也收集起废料来了。结果，废料虽然收集了不少，但是产品质量仍然没有提高，返工报废浪费仍然很大。
    到底怎样开展增产节约运动呢？这个厂的党和行政领导同志正在进行研究，但是仍然停留在如何堵塞材料的浪费方面，至于如何提高产品质量，如何既持久又全面地开展增产节约运动，还没有进一步深入研究出个办法。
