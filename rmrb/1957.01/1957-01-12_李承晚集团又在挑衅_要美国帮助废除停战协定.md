Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th – Seoul dispatch: The South Korean National Assembly today passed a resolution openly demanding that the US Congress help it abolish the Korean Armistice Agreement. This is another provocative action by Syngman Rhee after announcing at the beginning of this year that abolishing the armistice agreement is one of his main goals for this year.

The resolution also opposes the US proposal in the United Nations to hold so-called "free elections" in Korea, advocating for elections to be held only in North Korea. This resolution has been sent to the US Congress and the United Nations General Assembly.

    李承晚集团又在挑衅
    要美国帮助废除停战协定
    新华社平壤11日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜国会今天通过一项决议，公然要求美国国会帮助它废除朝鲜停战协定。这是李承晚在今年年初宣布废除停战协定是他今年的主要目标之一以后的又一挑衅行动。
    这项决议还反对美国在联合国提出的在朝鲜举行所谓“自由选举”的计划，主张只在朝鲜北部举行选举。这项决议已经送给美国国会和联合国大会。
