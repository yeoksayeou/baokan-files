Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 22nd. Yesterday, the Hubei Daily published a front-page headline highlighting the exemplary deeds of the employees of the joint state-private Hanyang Machine Factory in working hard and practicing diligence and frugality in running the enterprise.

The joint state-private Hanyang Machine Factory was formed by merging more than twenty small private factories. Not only were the buildings simple and the equipment incomplete, but most of the machines were very old. Some machines had been in use for fifty or sixty years, and some were repaired after being scrapped. However, since last year, the factory's employees have produced many large new products for more than 100 construction units, including Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, and Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. These products include highly precise propellers, various water pumps, and gate valves with a diameter of 800 millimeters. Orders for the factory have come from units across more than ten provinces and cities.

In the process of manufacturing these new products, the employees made every effort to utilize the dilapidated machines and overcome equipment shortages. They repaired six lathes that were about to be scrapped and put them back into production. They also converted several belt-driven lathes into automatic lathes. The iron smelting furnace had a small capacity and high coal consumption, making it unsuitable for casting large castings. They converted a scrapped three-section furnace into a new type of iron melting furnace, increasing the capacity by one-third and reducing coal consumption by half. When manufacturing the 800-millimeter diameter gate valves, the employees also converted a hand-operated planer into a large boring machine, overcoming the difficulty of lacking machine equipment at the time.

### 汉阳机器厂勤俭办企业  用旧机器造出大型新产品

    汉阳机器厂勤俭办企业
    用旧机器造出大型新产品
    新华社武汉22日电　昨天湖北日报以第一版头条新闻的重要地位，登载了公私合营汉阳机器厂职工艰苦奋斗、勤俭办企业的模范事迹。
    公私合营汉阳机器厂是由二十多个私营小厂合并起来的，不仅房屋简陋，设备不全，而且绝大部分机器十分破旧，有的机器已经用了五、六十年，有的是报废了重新修起来的。但是，从去年以来，这个厂的职工却为武汉钢铁公司、武汉重型机床厂、武汉长江大桥等一百多个建设单位，生产了许多大型新产品，如精密度要求很高的推进器，各种水泵和口径八百米厘的闸门凡尔等。向这个厂订货的单位遍及十几个省市。
    职工们在制造这些新产品过程中，尽量把破烂机器利用起来，克服设备的不足。他们曾经把六台快要报废的车床重新修理后投入生产，把几部用皮带带动的车床，改装为自动车床。炼铁炉容量小、煤耗大，不适于浇铸大型铸件，他们就把一个已经报废的三节炉改装成新式熔铁炉，容量加大了三分之一，煤耗也降低了一半以上。在制造口径八百米厘的闸门凡尔的时候，职工们还把一个手摇刨床改为大型搪床，克服了当时缺乏机器设备的困难。
