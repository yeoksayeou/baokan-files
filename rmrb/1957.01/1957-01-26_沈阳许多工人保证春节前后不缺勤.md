Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th - Workers in many factories in Shenyang have proposed guarantees of no absence before and after the Spring Festival. Han Shude, a young worker at Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, originally planned to return to his hometown in Shandong to visit his mother during the Spring Festival and had already requested a twenty-day leave from his superiors. However, when he discovered that four out of the seven workers in his group had applied for leave to go home, leaving only three people to complete the production tasks, he voluntarily withdrew his request to go home. He wrote a long letter, sending a recent photo and money to his mother, so she could celebrate the Spring Festival at home with peace of mind. Influenced by Han Shude, more than twenty workers in Workshop No. 5 who had planned to ask for leave to go home all cancelled their plans.

The forty-two workers of the First Youth Work Section of the Shenyang Steel Rolling Plant, in order to complete the production plan for January and February, proposed an initiative to all factory workers to ensure no absence before and after the Spring Festival. This initiative was met with enthusiastic response from all work sections and groups in the factory. Workers in Group B of Shift A of the weaving branch of the Shenyang Woolen Mill challenged all factory workers to guarantee no absence before and after the Spring Festival. As a result, within two days, workers from twenty-two groups throughout the factory had responded to the challenge.

Various factories have prepared rich and varied holiday activities to ensure that employees who do not return home have a pleasant Spring Festival. Many older workers at the Shenyang Cable Factory, whose families are in Shenyang, plan to invite young workers whose families are not in Shenyang to visit their homes during the Spring Festival. The older workers also plan to share their past experiences of hard work and struggle with the young workers. Leading cadres of the Shenyang Woolen Mill plan to go to the single dormitories of the employees during the Spring Festival and spend the holiday with the workers who do not return home. Factories such as the Shenyang Battery Factory, Shenyang Woolen Mill, and Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant have all prepared a variety of entertaining evening events, including exciting dramas, movies, dances, and games competitions.

    沈阳许多工人保证春节前后不缺勤
    新华社沈阳24日电　沈阳市不少工厂的工人提出春节前后不缺勤的保证。沈阳第一机床厂的青年工人韩树德，原来准备春节回山东老家看望母亲，已经向领导上请假二十天。可是当他发现全组七个工人就有四个工人请假回家，剩下三个人，无法完成生产任务的时候，他就自动撤消了请假回家的要求，写了一封长信把新近照的照片和钱一起寄给了母亲，让她在家里安心过春节。在韩树德的影响下，五号车间二十多个准备请假回家的工人，都取消了请假回家的打算。
    沈阳轧钢厂第一青年工段四十二名工人，为完成1、2月份生产计划，向全厂工人提出了春节前后不缺勤的倡议以后，得到全厂各工段、各小组的响应。沈阳毛织厂机织分场甲班乙组的工人，向全厂工人提出了保证春节前后不缺勤的挑战，结果在两天内，全厂就有二十二个小组的工人提出了应战。
    各个工厂为了使不回家的职工愉快地度过春节，已经准备了丰富多采的假日活动。沈阳电缆厂许多家在沈阳的老工人，准备在春节中邀请家不在沈阳的青年工人去他们家作客；老工人还准备给青年工人讲讲他们过去艰苦奋斗的生活经历。沈阳毛织厂的领导干部在春节期间，准备深入到职工独身宿舍去，同不回家的工人一起过春节。沈阳蓄电池厂、沈阳毛织厂、沈阳第一机床厂等工厂，都准备了精采的戏剧、电影、舞蹈、游艺比赛等多种形式的娱乐晚会。
