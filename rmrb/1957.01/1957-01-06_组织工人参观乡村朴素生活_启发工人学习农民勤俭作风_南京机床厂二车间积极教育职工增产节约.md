(Our Nanjing dispatch) The Second Processing Workshop of the state-owned Nanjing Machine Tool Factory is conducting ideological education on increasing production and practicing economy for its employees through methods such as organizing employee visits to rural areas and holding employee representative meetings.

At the beginning of December last year, when the Second Workshop branch wanted to implement the work plan for increasing production and practicing economy among the masses, some people thought, "Increasing production and practicing economy is an annual event. The plan is almost complete, so it doesn't matter much whether we do it or not." Others felt, "We are currently very busy and don't have time to carry out a movement!" The branch leadership realized at the time that a simplistic approach would not work, and it was necessary to first inspire cadres to consciously recognize the significance of carrying out increased production and practicing economy through meticulous ideological work, before mobilizing the masses of employees to take action. Therefore, on the one hand, they organized cadres to study the "Eighth National Congress" documents and the spirit of the Second Plenary Session, and on the other hand, they organized them to go deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research. They saw that the workshop wasted enough working hours in just August, September, and October of last year to build forty 1336 lathes. Among the workers, more and more people were pursuing quotas regardless of quality and wasting materials.

Before educating the masses of employees, the workshop cadres also conducted research and analysis on the employees' thinking, believing that the various phenomena of waste were mainly caused by the leadership focusing only on technical work and emphasizing the improvement of material life this year, while neglecting the ideological education of hard struggle. Therefore, the branch committee members believed that the primary issue was to inspire employees to consciously criticize these problems. In this work, in addition to generally explaining the principles, they also adopted the method of organizing employee visits to rural areas. When visiting the Qinhuai Agricultural Cooperative on the outskirts of Nanjing, they changed the previous approach of holding grand celebrations with gongs and drums. They first listened to the cooperative's cadres introduce the farmers' struggle against natural disasters, and then went deep into the fields and farmers' homes, helping with labor while chatting casually. In the cordial conversations, the workers saw and heard about the farmers' diligent, thrifty, and hard lives and their spirit of "taking the cooperative as their home," which greatly inspired them. Su Wand, a roller worker, usually lived extravagantly. After buying a bicycle, he wanted to buy a radio. In order to get money, he disregarded quality and wasted materials, single-mindedly pursuing exceeding quotas. This time, he saw that the farmers even picked up a small piece of wood to give to the cooperative and deposited seven cents in the bank. He was both moved and ashamed. After returning to the factory, he criticized his past thinking and voluntarily asked to reduce the quota. He was no longer sloppy when working. The people who participated in the visit held a discussion after returning to the factory and conveyed the message to all the employees, which educated everyone. As a result, many people put forward the slogan of "Taking the factory as home, running the factory diligently and thriftily," saying, "If our peasant brothers can do this, we should do it even more!"

On this basis, the workshop held an employee representative meeting. At this meeting, the leadership guided everyone to widely carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, and boldly exposed various problems in management and production. At the same time, the representatives meticulously calculated the waste of time and defective products. For example, in August, September, and October of last year, the entire workshop increased production by 59,000 yuan according to the target, but the loss caused by defective products was as high as 87,000 yuan. These facts not only educated the employees but also inspired the leading cadres to realize the great harm caused by their own bureaucratic style.

Now, the workshop leaders are continuing to carry out ideological mobilization and production research and investigation work, preparing to formulate a plan for increasing production and practicing economy. At this time, the atmosphere in the workshop is different from before. From the beginning of December to now, the scrap rate has been gradually decreasing, and the working hours have exceeded the quota by more than 2,000 hours. When discussing and revising the quota, most of the workers consciously tapped potential, looked for shortcuts, and proposed more advanced quotas. Lathe worker Zhao Yongsheng usually handed over the work to his apprentice after going to work, found someone to chat with, and didn't care about defective products. When revising the quota, he deliberately slowed down the feed rate to make it easier to set a loose quota. This time, the quota he proposed surprised the workshop cadres. For one workpiece, the original quota was thirty-three minutes to make one, but he now proposed "fifteen minutes, guaranteed to achieve."

Jiangsu Xinhua Daily published an editorial on December 21, introducing and commenting on the experience of this workshop in carrying out ideological education on increasing production and practicing economy, and praised their approach. (Xinhua Daily)

    组织工人参观乡村朴素生活　启发工人学习农民勤俭作风
    南京机床厂二车间积极教育职工增产节约
    本报南京讯　国营南京机床厂第二加工车间，通过组织职工访问农村和召开职工代表会议等方式，向职工进行增产节约的思想教育。
    去年12月初，第二车间支部想把开展增产节约工作计划贯彻到群众中去时，有人认为“增产节约一年一度，现在计划完成没大问题，搞也好不搞也不大紧”。或觉得“当前工作很忙，没有工夫搞运动！”支部领导当时便意识到，用简单化的做法是行不通的，必须通过细致的思想工作首先启发干部自觉地认识当前开展增产节约的意义，而后才能发动职工群众行动起来。于是，他们一方面组织干部好好学习“八大”文件、二中全会的精神，并且组织他们深入群众作调查研究。他们看到：车间仅去年8、9、10三个月浪费的工时，就够造1336车床四十部。在工人中，许多人为追求定额不顾质量、不惜浪费材料的事情越来越多。
    在对职工群众进行教育之先，车间干部又对职工思想作了研究分析，认为各种浪费现象的产生，主要是领导上今年以来只顾抓技术工作和强调物质生活改善，而忽视了艰苦奋斗思想教育的原故。因此，支部委员们都认为首要的问题是启发职工自觉地批判这些问题。在这项工作中，他们除了一般讲道理，并采用了组织职工访问农村。在访问南京市郊秦淮农业社时，他们改变了以往敲锣打鼓搞联欢的方式，先听合作社的干部介绍农民与自然灾害作斗争的情况，然后深入田间和农民家里，一边帮助劳动一边扯家常。在亲切的交谈中，工人看到和听到农民们勤俭艰苦的生活和“以社为家”的精神，受到很大启发。滚床工苏万德平时生活铺张，买了脚踏车又想买收音机，为了弄钱就不顾质量和浪费一味地追求超额。这次，他看到农民们连一块小木头都要捡起给社里，七分钱都要存入银行，既感动又惭愧，回厂后他就批判了过去的思想，自动要求压缩定额，干活时也不马虎了。参观的人回厂后举行了座谈，又向全体职工作了传达，使大家都受到了教育。于是有许多人提出了“以厂为家，勤俭办厂”的口号，说：“农民弟兄能这样办，我们更要这样办！”
    在这个基础上，车间举行了职工代表会议。在这个会议上，领导上引导大家广泛地开展自下而上的批评和自我批评，大胆地揭发了管理生产上的种种问题。同时，代表们又细致地算了时间浪费和废品等细账。如去年8、9、10三个月份，全车间按指标增产了五万九千元，但因废品造成的损失就有八万七千元之多。这些事实不但教育了职工，也启发领导干部们认识到了自己的官僚主义作风造成了多大危害。
    现在，车间领导干部正继续进行思想发动和生产调查研究工作，准备制定增产节约方案。这时，车间里的气象已与以前不同了。从12月上旬到现在，废品率已在逐步下降，工时超额了两千多小时。在讨论修改定额时，绝大部分工人都自觉地挖潜力、找窍门、提出比较先进的定额。车床工人赵永生平时上班后把活交给徒弟做，自己找人聊天，出了废品满不在乎，修改定额时还故意把走刀速度减慢，好订得松些。这次他提出的定额使车间干部都吃了一惊，有个工作物原来定额是三十三分钟做一个，他现在提出“十五分钟，包能达到”。
    江苏新华日报于12月21日发表社论，对这个车间开展增产节约思想教育工作的经验作了介绍和评述，表扬了他们这种做法。（新华日报）
