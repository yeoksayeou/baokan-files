　　From January 7th to 14th, French Foreign Minister Pineau visited France's "allies" across the Atlantic for a whole week and held talks with Dulles. According to French officials, this visit was a "tense side event" before the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Algerian issue, with the aim of getting Washington to support France at the UN General Assembly.

　　It seems that Pineau's trip was successful. On January 16th, a French government spokesman said that Pineau's talks with Dulles in Washington were "very effective" and that Dulles showed a good understanding of France's position on the Algerian issue.

　　How did Pineau make this visit "very effective"? Some reports from Western news agencies reveal that the method was simple: when Dulles suggested in the talks that France should adopt a "reasonable viewpoint" on the Algerian issue, Pineau nodded in agreement, and things were successful.

　　What exactly does the "reasonable viewpoint" that Dulles asked France to adopt mean? Some political commentators in London revealed that Washington is preparing to use Algeria as a "touchstone" for promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and Dulles's request to France is simply not to refuse this point.

　　On the same day as Pineau's talks with Dulles, the French Ambassador to the United States, Hervé Alphand, could not wait to make a gesture to show that France already had the "reasonable viewpoint" that Dulles required. He declared that France agreed with "President Eisenhower's new American policy in the Middle East."

　　Of course, Washington would be satisfied with this performance by France. United Press reporter Edward Depre excitedly wrote that Pineau's talks with Dulles "were of great significance."

　　However, for France, this "great significance" is not a good sign. Because, despite Washington's support, discussions on the Algerian issue at the United Nations General Assembly will still be difficult to prevent; but once the "Eisenhower Doctrine" pays a visit to Algeria, France will inevitably be kicked out as it was in Indochina. People like Pineau are unwilling to abandon the outdated burden of colonialism, and would rather beg for help from Washington, an ill-intentioned partner, only to get back such a "reasonable viewpoint"!

### “合理的观点”

    “合理的观点”
    1月7日到14日，法国外交部长比诺到大西洋彼岸的“盟国”访问了整整一个星期，并且同杜勒斯举行了会谈。按照法国官方人士的说法，这次访问是在联合国大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题之前的“一次紧张的会外活动”，目的是要华盛顿在联合国大会上为法国撑腰。
    看来，比诺此行似乎是如愿以偿了。1月16日，法国一位政府发言人说，比诺同杜勒斯在华盛顿的会谈是“非常有效”的，杜勒斯表现出很能了解法国在阿尔及利亚问题上的立场。
    比诺是怎样使得这次访问成为“非常有效”的呢？西方通讯社的一些报道透露说，办法很简单：当杜勒斯在会谈中提出法国应该在阿尔及利亚问题上采取“合理的观点”的时候，比诺点头同意，于是事情就成功了。
    杜勒斯要求法国采取的“合理的观点”，究竟意味着什么呢？伦敦一些政治评论家透露说：华盛顿准备把阿尔及利亚当作推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的一块“试金石”，杜勒斯对法国的要求也就是不许拒绝这一点而已。
    在比诺同杜勒斯会谈的当天，法国驻美国的大使埃尔弗·阿尔芳就急不及待地作出一个姿态，来表现法国已经具有杜勒斯所要求的“合理的观点”。他声明说，法国同意“艾森豪威尔总统制订的美国在中东的新政策”。
    当然，华盛顿会对法国的这种表现感到满意。“合众社”记者爱德华·德普里就兴高采烈地写道：比诺同杜勒斯的“这次会谈是有重大意义的”。
    然而，对于法国来说，这种“重大意义”却不是一个好兆头。因为，尽管有华盛顿的撑腰，联合国大会对阿尔及利亚问题的讨论仍然是难以阻挠的；但是“艾森豪威尔主义”一光顾阿尔及利亚，法国就势必像在印度支那那样被一脚踢出去。比诺之流不愿丢下殖民主义这个过时的包袱，宁肯向华盛顿不怀好意的伙伴去乞援求助，结果拿回来却是这样一个“合理的观点”！　（录）
