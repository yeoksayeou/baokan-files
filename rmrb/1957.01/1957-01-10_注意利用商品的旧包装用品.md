    Pay Attention to Utilizing Old Packaging Materials of Goods
    Most goods require outer packaging during circulation. The commercial system handles a wide variety of goods, with hundreds of types of outer packaging, resulting in significant packaging expenses. In 1955, packaging costs for state-owned commercial goods accounted for 5.3% of the total commodity circulation costs. In Shanghai, twenty-six state-owned commercial units spent 4.2 million yuan on packaging from January to September 1955.
    However, many commercial departments do not prioritize saving on packaging materials. Wooden crates used for packaging goods, which can generally be reused several times, are often dismantled and used as firewood by some units. Some units, under the guise of "caring for the well-being of employees," give the wooden crates to the employee cafeteria to be burned as firewood (without payment or with very little payment). Some units even sell the wooden crates to employees' families at a low price to be used as firewood.
    The phenomenon of carelessly piling up and discarding packaging materials is also serious in various places. Many units fail to manage existing packaging materials, treating old packaging materials as "off-the-books property" and discarding them at will. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce recently discovered that a wholesale station in Hangzhou had over 1,000 kilograms of tinplate piled up in the open air, already rusting and corroding. Some warehouses leave wooden crates outdoors for long periods without any treatment. Some units do not purchase necessary tools for opening and unpacking, resulting in boxes being smashed and tinplate pried off and broken during chaotic disassembly...
    The waste caused by improper handling of old packaging materials is significant. Within the same unit, the same type of packaging material is often both bought and sold. For example, they sell wooden crates to employees' families at a low price to be used as firewood, while simultaneously buying wood from lumber companies to make wooden crates. Among the twenty-six companies and supply stations under the Shanghai First and Third Commercial Bureaus, losses due to the low-price sale of old wooden crates amounted to more than 900,000 yuan.
    This waste can be avoided if commercial departments pay attention to it. Several purchasing and supply stations under the Shanghai Third Commercial Bureau, after focusing on utilizing old packaging materials, initially estimated that in the first half of 1956 alone, utilizing old wooden crates, cardboard boxes, and plywood had saved the state more than 111,000 yuan. In Chongqing, Wuhan, Guizhou, and Hunan, some commercial departments exchanged old packaging materials with each other in 1955, with the total value of transactions reaching more than 300,000 yuan.
    It is clear that the potential for saving on packaging within the commercial system is great. As long as we attach importance to it ideologically, establish necessary systems, and take practical and feasible measures, we can increase production and save much wealth for the country.　Liang Jianju, Wang Jianli

    注意利用商品的旧包装用品
    多数商品在流通过程中，需要有外包装。商业系统经营的商品种类繁多，外包装的种类也有一百几十种，包装业务的开支很大。1955年，国营商业商品包装费用占整个商品流通费用的5.3％。上海市二十六个国营商业单位，1955年一至三季度包装费用为四百二十万元。
    不少商业部门却不重视节约包装用品。装商品的木箱，一般是可以重复使用几次的，但一些单位都把木箱拆开当柴烧了。有些单位在“照顾职工生活”的美名下，把木箱给职工食堂当柴烧（食堂不付钱或付很少的钱）。有的单位还把木箱贱价卖给职工家属当柴烧。
    各地随意堆积、弃置包装用品的现象也很严重。许多单位无人管理现有的包装用品，有的把旧包装用品当成“帐外财产”，任意弃置。浙江省商业厅最近发现杭州一个批发站，露天堆放一千多斤铁皮，已生锈腐蚀。有的仓库把木箱放在露天，长期不加处理。一些单位没有购置必要的开箱拆包工具，乱敲乱拆，结果把箱子打碎了，铁皮撬断了……。
    因处理旧包装用品不当而形成的浪费现象是很大的。在同一个单位中，一种包装用品，往往是一面买进、一面卖出。例如，他们把木箱低价卖给职工家属当柴烧，同时又向木材公司买木板做木箱。在上海第一、三商业局所属的二十六个公司和供应站中，因低价出售旧木箱，曾损失九十多万元。
    这种浪费现象，只要商业部门加以重视，是可以避免的。上海市第三商业局的几个采购供应站，注意利用旧包装材料后，据1956年上半年初步统计，仅利用旧木箱、纸版箱、纸夹板等已为国家节约了十一万一千多元。重庆、武汉、贵州、湖南四个省市，有些商业部门，1955年互相交流成交旧包装用品总额达三十多万元。
    可见，商业系统节约包装的潜力很大。只要我们从思想上加以重视，建立必要的制度，采取切实可行的措施，那就可为国家增产节约许多财富。　梁建巨、王建里
