Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 20th: Today is the day of the parliamentary elections in Poland. People everywhere began voting from six o'clock in the morning. In cities like Warsaw, Katowice, and Wrocław, some voters gathered in front of the polling stations before six o'clock to wait to vote.

Comrade Gomulka voted at the 348th polling station in Warsaw at 9:05 AM. As he walked back from the polling station, voters crowded around him, singing Poland's most popular folk song, "May He Live Among Us a Hundred Years."

Today, red flags are flying all over Warsaw, and voters are entering and leaving various polling stations with happy smiles. At the 358th polling station, Anzhevska, a female worker from the Zeran Automobile Factory, cast the first vote at exactly six o'clock. In the village of Novi-Drowie, in the suburbs of Warsaw, a peasant woman cast the first vote. Polish sailors sailing in the Indian Ocean voted in advance according to local time. In Kielce Province, voters at the 90th polling station had all voted by 10:00 AM. In Wrocław, more than 90,000 people had already voted by 8:00 AM.

According to this reporter's observations, the vast majority of voters responded to Comrade Gomulka's call and did not cross out a single candidate. They took the ballot papers and, without entering the secret voting booths, put them directly into the ballot box. At the 102nd polling station, a 78-year-old female revolutionary, Michalschenova, told reporters while voting, "Of course, I will not cross out a single candidate. We must trust Comrade Gomulka, he can lead us to victory." In Opole, taxi drivers offered free rides to sick people to vote. As of 12:00 noon, voting was still proceeding intensely.

    华沙红旗飘扬　选民面带喜色
    波兰人民踊跃投票
    新华社华沙20日电　今天是波兰进行议会选举的日子。各地人民从早晨六时起就开始投票。在华沙、卡托维兹、弗罗茨瓦夫等城市，有些选民在六时前就聚集在选举站门前等候投票。
    哥穆尔卡同志九时五分在华沙的三四八选举站投了票。当他从选举站步行回来的时候，选民们拥挤在他周围，高唱波兰最流行的民歌“让他在我们中间生活一百年”。
    华沙市今天全市红旗飘扬，选民们面带喜色，出入各个选举站。在第三五八选举站，泽兰汽车厂女工安哲夫斯卡在六时整投了第一票。在华沙市郊的诺维—德罗维村中，一位农妇投了第一票。航行印度洋上的波兰海员们提前按当地时间投完了票。在基尔兹省，第九十号选举站的选民们在上午十时就全部投票完毕。在弗罗茨瓦夫市，到上午八时就已经有九万多人投了票。
    据记者所见，绝大多数选民都响应了哥穆尔卡同志的号召，不划掉一个候选人。他们拿起选票也不走进秘密投票室，就把选票投入票箱。在第一○二选举站，一位七十八岁的女革命家米哈尔谢诺娃在投票时对记者说，我当然不划掉一个候选人，要信任哥穆尔卡同志，他能够领导我们走向胜利。在奥波尔城，出租汽车的司机们免费送病人去投票。到中午十二时止，投票还在紧张进行中。
