    Who do "Attending Delegates" Represent?

    I often see the term "attending delegates" in newspapers and periodicals. On November 17th of last year, your newspaper published a report on the conference of activists in investigation and research work in the Liaoning Province commercial system on page three, and the term "attending delegates" appeared again. But who do "attending delegates" represent? It should be said that there is no such type of person in society called "attending," so there is no way to have delegates. I think this is an improper use of words and should be called "attending personnel" instead. (Xue Bing)

    “列席代表”代表谁？
    时常在报刊上看到列席代表一词。去年11月17日你报三版刊登辽宁省商业系统调查研究工作积极分子代表会议的报道中，又出现了“列席代表”。可是“列席代表”代表谁呢？应该说社会上并没有列席称呼的一种人，自然就无从出代表。我觉得这是用词不当，应该称为“列席人员”才对。（学兵）
