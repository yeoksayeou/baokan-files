Research and Prevention of Termites
Cai Banghua, Deputy Director of the Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Ants are distributed all over the earth, while termites only live in warm areas, especially in the tropics and subtropics. In China, they are most prevalent in provinces south of the Yangtze River, especially Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Taiwan, and Yunnan. The further north, the fewer termites there are. At present, thirty to forty species of termites have been collected in China, but this is very incomplete, because there are already one thousand eight hundred known species of termites in the world. China has a vast and complex environment, and there must be many more species that have not been discovered.

Termites are a polymorphic insect that lives in large family groups. Its family members often number one or two million individuals, but eighty to ninety percent are non-reproductive worker termites and soldier termites. Only ten to twenty percent will develop into reproductive types of termites, of which there is usually only one queen termite, commonly known as the "Queen," which is the only individual that reproduces. Her body is fat, like a large peanut, and her body length often exceeds two inches. In addition to constantly laying eggs, she does no other work. On average, she can lay four thousand eggs a day, and millions of eggs a year. The queen's lifespan is generally six to nine years. The power of reproduction is astonishing.

Because of the different species, termites have different habits. Termites are divided into two main categories: wood-dwelling and ground-dwelling. Purely wood-dwelling termites are the more primitive species of termites. They generally lack worker termites, specialize in boring into wood, and do not live in the soil. For example, the drywood termites that damage houses in Guangdong and Hainan belong to this category. They often bore into wood and excrete dry, sand-like feces, which accumulate indoors. Ground-dwelling termites build nests underground, and there are partial ground-dwelling and specialized ground-dwelling types. Partial ground-dwelling termites have their main nests underground, but can invade wood through tunnels to cause damage. The most common and most serious type of termite in China is the Formosan subterranean termite, which grows in provinces south of the Yangtze River, as well as in Hubei and Chaoxian County in Anhui. In rural areas around Kaiping County, Guangdong, almost nine out of ten houses are infested by it, and about 30% are severely damaged, with roofs collapsing, which can be seen in every village. Therefore, the Cantonese call termites toothless tigers. The Formosan subterranean termite and another species, the Black-winged termite, are also pests of railway sleepers, bridges, wooden power poles, and electrical wire materials. In several southern provinces of China, if Masson pine is used for railway sleepers, it can only last for two or three years on average. In areas with severe termite infestation, railway sleepers and bridges have to be replaced every year, which is a huge loss to national construction. In addition, all stored items in warehouses, taro, sugarcane, ramie, mulberry, tea, citrus, pine trees, and eucalyptus trees growing in the fields are susceptible to damage by these termites.

Ground-dwelling or partially ground-dwelling termites often build nests underground, up to one or two meters deep, and the nest diameter is often more than one meter. These termites generally only eat the roots of grass and trees and live in the wilderness, which seems to have little impact, but in the Jingjiang levee area of Hubei, the nests of black-winged termites often become the root cause of breaking through the levee and causing floods during the flood season. Among the ground-dwelling termites, there are also those that build mounds of soil, protruding from the ground, forming tower-shaped or building-shaped termite mounds. This is a common phenomenon in tropical regions such as Africa and Australia, and the towers sometimes reach five or six meters in height. In Longzhou, Guangxi, and Cheli, Yunnan, the Macrotermes barneyi and Globitermes brunnens are rare species with termite mounds in China. Its termite mound protrudes from the ground like a small mound, shaped like an earthen tomb, and the taller ones are about one meter high.

There are many ways to control termites. There are two types of methods popular among farmers in China for controlling termites: First, farmers dig out and kill termites in winter according to ancestral secret recipes. They have mastered the living habits of several termites that harm houses, so they are good at digging out termite nests. Second, they use the characteristic that termites have the weakest resistance to arsenic poison, and use drugs such as arsenic trioxide and Paris green to prepare medicated powder to poison termites. Both of these methods have their advantages and are worth paying attention to and scientifically organizing.

Among the termites that harm houses, Formosan subterranean termites are the main species in China, and black-winged termites are also common. Drywood termites in Guangdong and yellow-breasted termites in Hangzhou are secondary. The latter two lack main nests and belong to the scattered termite type, which general soil termite experts are unable to control. Only Formosan subterranean termites, commonly known as cage termites, are an easy target for them to control. This type of termite often builds large nests under tree roots next to houses, under wooden power poles, or between stoves and tombs, and often penetrates the surrounding ground through tunnels to harm house timbers, reaching as far as one hundred and twenty steps away. The four months between the Beginning of Winter and Qingming Festival is the most suitable time to dig out termite nests, when termites are hibernating in their nests. This is also the slack season for farmers, making it a suitable time to carry out prevention and control. An important sign for exploring termite nests is the ability to recognize termite emergence holes and ventilation holes, which makes it easier to dig out termite nests nearby.

Thoroughly mix 46% arsenic trioxide, 22% salicylic acid, and 32% talcum powder, and blow it into the termite tunnels with a sharp-mouthed powder blower with a leather sac, which can kill termites. If the house is thoroughly inspected and sprayed carefully one by one, all termites in the nest can be killed five days later. However, arsenic powder is quite toxic, and attention must be paid to safety when using it. If used outdoors, pay attention to prevent rain from washing it away and making it ineffective. Use poisonous soil to protect the foundation of buildings from termites. Method for preparing poisonous soil: For every cubic foot of soil, use 4.6 liters of 10% sodium arsenite, or 2.3 liters of pentachlorophenol (2.5 pounds of pentachlorophenol dissolved in 4.5 liters of turpentine, then diluted with kerosene to 31.5 liters), or 2.3 liters of trichlorobenzene (4.5 liters of trichlorobenzene liquid mixed with 18 liters of kerosene), and mix it into poisonous soil, which is placed around the foundation, about half a foot thick, and can prevent termites for about five years. However, these drugs are toxic to plants and should be avoided near well water or drinking water. There is also a fumigation method: wood-dwelling termites often move close to the surface of the wood before emergence. At this time, doors and windows can be tightly closed, and two to four pounds of chloropicrin per thousand cubic feet can be used for fumigation for forty-eight to seventy-two hours. When ground-dwelling termites are difficult to dig out of their nests, fresh pine stakes can be driven into the ground. After one or two months, gently pull them out and check the stake surface. If it has been eroded by termites, it proves that the stake hole and the termite nest have been drilled through. Carbon disulfide liquid can be injected into the hole, and then the soil is sealed to fumigate and kill termites in the nest. This method is also suitable for fumigating and killing underground termites in the wild.

In areas with many termites, wooden buildings should be avoided as much as possible. Otherwise, try to select termite-resistant wood, such as Eucalyptus exserta, Phoebe zhennan, teak, etc. However, the most practical method is to carry out wood preservation. All railway sleepers, bridges, wooden power poles, and building materials must be pre-treated with creosote oil or pentachlorophenol, which have high termite-proof properties, for preservation, or set up termite-proof iron plates in the foundation, or protect the foundation with poisonous soil, etc., all of which can prevent termite damage.

    关于白蚁的研究和防治
    中国科学院昆虫研究所副所长　蔡邦华
    蚂蚁分布在地球各处，白蚁仅生在温暖地带，尤以热带、亚热带为多。在我国长江以南，尤以广东、广西、福建、台湾、云南等省繁殖最盛，越向北白蚁越少。目前在我国范围内，已采到三、四十种白蚁，但这是十分不完全的，因为全世界已知道有一千八百种白蚁，我国有广大而复杂的环境，一定还有很多种类没有发现。
    白蚁是一种多形态、营大家庭集团式生活的昆虫，它的家庭成员，多时达一、二百万个体，但十之八九是属于不生殖的工蚁和兵蚁，仅十之一二会发育为生殖类型的繁殖蚁，其中普通仅有一个母蚁，俗称“女王”，是唯一的实行生殖的个体，她身体肥大，像大花生，体长往往超过二寸以上，除不断地产卵以外，不做其它工作，平均一天内可产卵四千枚，每年产卵百万枚，母蚁寿命一般是六到九年，繁殖力之大，是令人吃惊的。
    白蚁因为种类不同，生活习性也有差异。白蚁有木栖性和地栖性两大类。单纯木栖性白蚁，是白蚁中较原始性的种类，一般缺工蚁，专蛀蚀木材，不入土内生活。例如广东海南一带，危害房屋的堆砂白蚁就属于这一类，常蛀蚀木材，排出干燥砂粒状粪便，堆积室内。地栖性白蚁，筑巢地下，其中又有部分地栖和专门地栖的分别。部分地栖性白蚁的主巢在地下，但能通过地道，侵入木材为害。这类白蚁在我国最普通，危害最严重的是家白蚁，生长在长江以南各省以及湖北、安徽巢县一带。广东开平县一带农村中，几乎十室九蛀，都是遭到它的侵蚀，其中约有30％危害严重，屋脊倒塌，每村都可以看到。所以广东人称白蚁为无牙老虎。家白蚁和另一种黑翅大白蚁，又是枕木、桥梁、电杆木、电线材料等的害虫，我国南方几省，铁道枕木如用马尾松，平均只能维持二、三年，白蚁严重地区，枕木、桥梁要一年一换，在国家建设上是个极大损失，此外凡仓库内一切贮藏物品，田野里生长的芋奶，甘蔗、苧麻、桑、茶、柑橘及松树、大叶桉等农林作物，都是容易受这类白蚁侵害的。
    地栖性或部分地栖性白蚁，常筑巢在地下，深达一、二公尺，蚁巢直径往往达一公尺以上。这类白蚁，一般仅吃草木根部，生活在原野荒地，好像利害关系不大，可是在湖北荆江大堤一带，黑翅大白蚁的巢窟，往往在发水时期，成为冲破堤身、引起水患的祸根。地栖性白蚁中也有筑土成封，突出地面，形成塔状、楼状的白蚁冢、在非洲、澳洲等热带地方是常见的现象，塔高有时达五、六公尺的。在我国广西龙州和云南车里一带的土垅大白蚁和球白蚁，是国内少见的有白蚁冢的种类，它的蚁冢突出地面如小土丘，形如土坟，高的也达一公尺左右。
    防治白蚁的方法很多。流行在我国农村间防治白蚁的方法有两类：第一、农民根据祖传秘方，在冬季出外刨灭白蚁。他们掌握了为害房屋的几种白蚁的生活规律，所以善于掘取蚁巢。第二、利用白蚁抵抗砷毒能力最弱的特性，应用亚砷酸、巴黎绿等药物，配制药粉毒杀白蚁。这两种方法都有它的先进性，是值得重视而加以科学整理的。
    危害家屋的白蚁，在我国以家白蚁为主，黑翅大白蚁也不少。广东的堆砂白蚁和杭州一带的黄胸白蚁为次，后两者缺主巢，属于散白蚁类型，在防治上是一般土白蚁专家所无能为力的。只有家白蚁，俗称为笼白蚁，是他们容易防治的对象，这种蚁常筑大巢在宅边树根下、电杆木下，或灶底、坟墓间，常由此向四周穿地道，侵害房屋木材，远时能达一百二十步以外。每当立冬后清明前四个月间，白蚁潜伏巢内过冬时，最适于掘巢取蚁。这时又值农闲季节，进行防治是合适的。钻探蚁巢重要标帜，在能认识白蚁的羽化孔和通气孔，就容易在它附近掘得蚁巢。
    将亚砷酸46％、水杨酸22％、滑石粉32％充分混和，用带皮囊的尖嘴吹粉管，吹入白蚁道内，可以杀灭白蚁。如在屋内经全面检查，一一仔细喷药，五日后可以杀死巢内全部白蚁。但砷粉颇毒，使用时须注意安全，如用于室外，要注意防雨水冲洗而失效。在建筑基地，用毒土保护墙基，防治白蚁法。毒土配制法：每立方市尺土壤，用10％亚砷酸钠4.6公升，或用五氯酚（每4.5公升松节油，溶解2.5磅五氯酚，然后用煤油稀释成31.5公升）2.3公升，或用三氯苯（三氯苯液4.5公升混于18公升煤油中）2.3公升，拌成毒土，安置在墙基四周，厚约半市尺，可以保持五年左右不生白蚁。但此等药剂，对于植物有毒，在井水或饮用流水附近，应该避免使用。还有熏蒸法：木栖性白蚁，在羽化前常移近木材表面，这时可密闭门窗，用氯化苦每千立方尺二到四斤，熏蒸四十八到七十二小时。对于地栖性白蚁难于掘巢时，可先用新鲜松桩，打入地下，经一、二月后轻轻拔起，检查桩面，如果已经被白蚁蛀蚀，即证明椿孔和白蚁巢间已经钻通，可注入二硫化碳液到孔内，再封上土，熏杀蚁巢内白蚁。这个方法也适用于野外熏杀地下白蚁。
    白蚁多的地区，尽可能避免用木造建筑，否则尽量选用抗白蚁性木材，例如细叶桉、乌楠、柚木等，但最实用的方法是进行木材防腐，凡枕木、桥梁、电杆木以及建筑用材，都必须事先用有高度防蚁性能的沥青克里苏油或五氯酚，进行防腐，或在墙基设置防蚁铁板，或用毒土保护墙基等法，都可以防止白蚁的侵害。
