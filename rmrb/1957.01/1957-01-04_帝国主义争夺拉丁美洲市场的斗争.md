    The Struggle of Imperialism for the Latin American Market
    Mei Er
    During World War II and the post-war years, American imperialism further squeezed out countries such as Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, and seized a controlling position in the foreign trade of Latin American countries, making the trade of Latin American countries mainly dependent on the United States. In the past two decades, trade between the United States and Latin America has increased fivefold, currently reaching $7 billion annually, equivalent to the total trade volume between the United States and Europe, and almost twice as much as trade between the United States and Asia. However, in recent years, trade between the United States and Latin America has begun to be threatened by the resurgence of Western European countries and Japan.
    Due to the predatory policies adopted by US imperialism in Latin American trade, the economies of Latin American countries have fallen into difficult situations. In order to get rid of their dependence on the United States, Latin American countries are expanding their trade with countries other than the United States. At the same time, Western European countries such as Britain and France, especially West Germany and Japan, which have recovered and developed in the years after the war, are also urgently demanding the return of the Latin American market they lost during the war. Therefore, the struggle of imperialism for the Latin American market has become increasingly acute.
    For a long time, Britain has occupied a considerable position in Latin American trade, especially in South America, where it once held an advantage. But from 1939 to 1950, Britain's trade with Latin America decreased by more than one-third. In order to improve Britain's situation in Latin America, Lord Reading and trade delegations were sent to Latin America in 1952 and 1953 respectively. In 1954, the British Deputy Minister of Trade personally visited countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.
    These efforts by Britain have resulted in some improvement in its trade with certain Latin American countries. In 1951, Britain accounted for 6.5% of Chile's total imports and exports, which had increased to 12% from January to November 1955. In Argentina, it also increased from 12.5% in 1951 to 14.5% in the first half of 1955. In the first half of 1955, Britain's total trade volume in Uruguay was slightly higher than that of the United States. However, due to competition from the United States and West Germany, Britain's trade with Latin America, especially in terms of exports, still faces great difficulties. In 1950, Britain's exports to Latin America exceeded West Germany by $270 million, but in 1954, West Germany exceeded Britain by $190 million. Last year, Britain sent a trade delegation to Brazil, but the trade negotiations were unsuccessful due to Brazil's lack of pounds sterling. British exports to countries such as Brazil, Chile, and Mexico are still behind West Germany.
    France, another country with traditional trade ties with Latin America, has been trying its best to export engines, electrical equipment, tractors, aluminum, iron pipes, and steel to Latin America as early as 1950, and increased loans to Latin American countries for seven to ten years to strengthen its exports. In 1954, a French economic delegation went to South America and signed long-term trade treaties with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, and El Salvador. In the first half of 1955, France's share of Argentina's imports had exceeded the pre-World War II level, accounting for 8% of Argentina's imports. But it also faced competition from the United States and West Germany. These years have not achieved decisive achievements in restoring and expanding its position in the Latin American market. Its trade with countries such as Brazil and Chile can only be maintained at the level of 1951 and 1952.
    West Germany and Japan have become two new powerful competitors in today's Latin American market.
    West Germany interrupted trade relations with Latin American countries during World War II and did not begin to recover until 1947. However, West Germany's exports to Latin America have caught up with Britain and France in the past three years. In 1955, West Germany's exports to Latin America amounted to $504 million, making it the second largest seller to Latin America after the United States. In order to develop trade with Latin America, the Minister of Economy of the West German government visited Latin America in 1954. At present, West Germany has concluded trade agreements with ten Latin American countries. The three-year trade agreement signed between West Germany and Argentina in 1954 stipulates that the export volume of each party shall be at least $90 million per year. The trade agreement signed between West Germany and Brazil involves trade of $284 million. West Germany also established the "West Germany-Argentina Joint Committee" and the "Brazil-West Germany Economic Development Committee" with these two countries respectively to supervise the implementation of the agreement and facilitate West German investment. West Germany has also concluded bilateral offsetting account agreements with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, and other countries, providing these countries with credit to expand its exports to these countries. In 1955, imports from West Germany increased in thirteen Latin American countries compared to 1954, with West Germany's exports to Colombia increasing by more than two and a half times, and West Germany's exports to Argentina increasing by nearly $15 million.
    Japan, which has been restricted by the United States from trading with China, is also actively developing trade with Latin America. In 1952, Argentina's imports from Japan accounted for only 2% of the total value, but in the first half of 1955, it had risen to 6%. Japan's total trade value in Brazil also rose from 1% in 1952 to 4%. Although its total exports to Latin America are not large, only $170 million in 1955, falling behind the United States, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada, and Italy, its development is astonishing. According to the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan's exports to Chile in 1955 were four times that of the previous year, exports to Panama increased by 220% compared to the previous year, and exports to Argentina increased by 72%. In the past two years, Japan has also exported ships to countries such as Brazil and Cuba.
    The expansion of West Germany and Japan in the Latin American market has not only intensified the contradictions between Britain, France, West Germany, and Japan, but has also affected the trade between the United States and Latin America.
    According to the Mexican newspaper, Latin America's imports from Western Europe have increased from 7% of Latin America's total imports in 1948 to 22% in 1954, while the United States decreased by 11% during the same period. In 1954, the United States' trade volume with Uruguay decreased by one-third compared to 1953, and decreased by another quarter in 1955 compared to 1954. The proportion of the United States in Uruguay's trade has dropped from 35.5% in 1951 to 14.7% in the first half of 1955. The proportion of the United States in the trade of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico has also declined to varying degrees. In 1955, compared with 1954, nine Latin American countries reduced their imports from the United States.
    In May 1956, the United Press reported that American merchants were encountering the toughest competition in the world market in recent years. It also said that the biggest battlefield is currently in South America. Bein, Vice Chairman of Pan American Grace Airways, pointed out that many countries are using "cheaper prices, more generous credit terms, and immediate delivery methods" to enter this region. He also warned that fierce foreign competition risks squeezing the United States out of its Latin American market. In 1955, Latin America's imports from the United States amounted to $3.113 billion, accounting for 48% of Latin America's total imports. Therefore, it is too early to say that the United States is in danger of being squeezed out of Latin America. But the United States' monopolization of the Latin American market and its arbitrary practices have indeed been threatened.
    Of course, the United States will not be willing to retreat a step in Latin America. In order to "iron out" the "wrinkles" in the relationship between the United States and Latin American countries, last July, Eisenhower, who had just recovered from a long illness, personally went to Panama to attend the Summit Conference of American States. At the meeting, he declared that a new era of developing economic cooperation among the countries in the Organization of American States has now arrived, and suggested that each country send special envoys to a special committee in the Organization of American States to study the financial, economic, and other issues of the American countries.
    But the Western European countries and Japan are not to be outdone, and they are still trying every means to expand trade with Latin America. In 1955 and early 1956, West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, and other countries signed multilateral trade payment agreements with countries such as Brazil and Argentina. Last February, a West German trade delegation composed of seventeen people arrived in Latin America. In early September last year, after visiting Mexico, Panama, and Colombia, the Japanese trade delegation arrived in Argentina, and the delegation will also discuss the development of trade with other South American countries. West Germany, Italy, France, Japan, and other countries, in order to increase exports to Latin America, are proposing or have proposed to invest in the establishment of steel plants, automobile and tractor plants, fertilizer plants, and shipyards in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and other countries. It is rumored that some Western European capitalists are even attempting to invest in oil exploitation in Venezuela, which is controlled by American oil monopoly capital.
    At the same time, as trade between the countries of the socialist camp and Latin American countries is gradually developing on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, Latin American countries are also strengthening their trade ties with each other. The market of imperialist countries in Latin America has correspondingly shrunk, and the contradictions between them have deepened.
    Imperialism is thus intensifying its struggle for the Latin American market, and this struggle is becoming increasingly acute.

    帝国主义争夺拉丁美洲市场的斗争
    梅尔
    第二次世界大战和战后的年代里，美国帝国主义进一步排挤了英、法、德、日等国，在拉丁美洲国家的对外贸易中占据了控制地位，使拉丁美洲国家的贸易主要依赖于美国。过去二十年内，美国同拉丁美洲之间的贸易增加了五倍，目前每年达七十亿美元，相当于美国同欧洲的贸易总量，比美国同亚洲的贸易几乎多一倍。但是，近几年来，美国同拉丁美洲的贸易开始遭到西欧国家和日本卷土重来的威胁。
    由于美帝国主义对拉丁美洲贸易所采取的掠夺政策，使拉丁美洲国家的经济陷于困难的境地。拉丁美洲国家为了摆脱对美国的依赖，正在扩展着同美国以外的其他国家的贸易。同时英、法等西欧国家，特别是西德和日本经过战后这些年来的恢复和发展也正迫切要求夺回在战时所失去的拉丁美洲市场。因此帝国主义争夺拉丁美洲市场的斗争就日益尖锐起来。
    很长时期内，英国在拉丁美洲的贸易中都占有相当的地位，尤其是在南美曾占优势。但从1939到1950年，英国对拉丁美洲的贸易减少了三分之一以上。为了改善英国在拉丁美洲的处境，1952和1953年英国先后派里丁勋爵和贸易代表团去拉丁美洲。1954年英国贸易副大臣又亲自访问了阿根廷、巴西和乌拉圭等国。
    英国的这些努力使它在对某些拉丁美洲国家的贸易上多少有了一些起色。1951年英国在智利的进出口总值中占6.5％，1955年1至11月已提高到12％，在阿根廷也从1951年的12.5％提高到1955年上半年的14.5％。1955年上半年英国在乌拉圭的贸易总额中还略高于美国。但是由于美国和西德等国的竞争，英国对拉丁美洲的贸易，特别是出口方面仍然遇到极大的困难。1950年英国对拉丁美洲的出口超过西德二亿七千万美元，但在1954年西德反而超过英国一亿九千万美元。去年英国曾派贸易代表团去巴西，但因巴西缺少英镑，贸易谈判没有成功。英国对巴西、智利、墨西哥等国的出口仍都落在西德的后面。
    另一个同拉丁美洲有传统贸易联系的法国，早在1950年就竭力向拉丁美洲出口发动机、电气设备、拖拉机、铝、铁管和钢等，并增加给拉丁美洲国家七年到十年的贷款以加强它的出口。1954年，法国经济代表团到南美，同阿根廷、巴西、智利、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚和萨尔瓦多签订了长期的通商条约。1955年上半年，在阿根廷的入口中，法国的比重已超过第二次世界大战以前的水平，占到阿根廷进口中的8％。但是它也同样遭到美国和西德的竞争。这些年来并没有在恢复和扩大它在拉丁美洲市场的地位上获得决定性的成就。它同巴西和智利等国的贸易仍旧只能维持在1951和1952年的水平上。
    西德和日本在今天的拉丁美洲市场上已经成为两个新的强大的竞争者。
    西德在第二次世界大战中断绝了同拉丁美洲国家的贸易来往，一直到1947年才开始恢复。但是西德对拉丁美洲的输出在过去三年中已先后赶上英国和法国。1955年西德对拉丁美洲的输出额达五亿零四百万美元，是拉丁美洲仅次于美国的第二个大卖主。为了开展同拉丁美洲的贸易，西德政府的经济部长曾于1954年到拉丁美洲访问。目前西德已同十个拉丁美洲国家缔有贸易协定。西德和阿根廷在1954年所签有效期三年的贸易协定规定每年每方的出口额至少九千万美元。西德和巴西所签的贸易协定贸易金额达二亿八千四百万美元。西德并分别和这两国成立“西德、阿根廷混合委员会”和“巴西、西德经济开发委员会”以监督协定的执行和便利西德的投资。西德还同阿根廷、巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、巴拉圭、乌拉圭等国订立双边抵消帐户协定，给这些国家以信贷来扩大它对这些国家的出口。1955年有十三个拉丁美洲国家从西德的入口都较1954年有所增加，西德对哥伦比亚的输出增加了二倍半以上，西德对阿根廷的输出增加了近一千五百万美元。
    被美国限制了对中国贸易的日本也正在积极发展对拉丁美洲的贸易。1952年，阿根廷自日本的入口只占总值的2％，1955年上半年已升到6％。日本在巴西的贸易总值中也自1952年的1％上升到4％。虽然它向拉丁美洲的输出总额不大，1955年只一亿七千万美元，落于美、西德、英、法、加、意之后，但是它的发展却是惊人的。据日本通商产业省宣布，1955年日本对智利的出口为前一年四倍，对巴拿马的出口比前一年增加了220％，对阿根廷的出口增加了72％。这两年日本还向巴西、古巴等国输出轮船。
    西德和日本在拉丁美洲市场上的扩展不但引起了英、法、西德、日等国之间矛盾的尖锐化，而且已经影响到美国对拉丁美洲的贸易。
    据墨西哥新闻报报道，拉丁美洲自西欧的进口在拉丁美洲的总进口值中已自1948年的7％增加到1954年的22％，而美国却在同时期减少了11％。1954年美国对乌拉圭的贸易额比1953年减少了三分之一，1955年比1954年又减少了四分之一。美国在乌拉圭贸易中所占比重已自1951年的35.5％降到1955年上半年的14.7％。美国在阿根廷、巴西、智利、墨西哥等国贸易中所占比重也都有不同程度的下降。1955年同1954年相比，有九个拉丁美洲国家减少了从美国的入口。
    1956年5月，合众社报道说，美国商人们在世界市场上正遭到若干年来最顽强的竞争。并说目前最大的战场是南美洲。泛美格雷斯航空公司副董事长贝恩指出，许多国家正利用“较廉的价格、比较宽大的信贷条件和立即交货等办法”打进这个地区。他并警告，激烈的外国竞争有把美国从它的拉丁美洲市场上排挤出去的危险。1955年，拉丁美洲自美国的进口额是三十一亿一千三百万美元，占了拉丁美洲进口总值的48％。因此说美国在拉丁美洲有排挤出去的危险未免言之过早。但是美国独霸拉丁美洲市场和为所欲为的做法确实已经受到了威胁。
    美国当然是不会甘心情愿在拉丁美洲退缩一步的。为了“熨平”美国同拉丁美洲国家间关系上的“绉纹”，去年7月，艾森豪威尔久病初愈就亲自赴巴拿马参加美洲国家总统会议。他在会上宣称发展美洲国家组织中各国经济合作的新时代现在已经来到，并建议各国派特使在美洲国家组织一个特别委员会来研究美洲国家的财政、经济等方面的问题。
    但是西欧各国和日本也不示弱，它们仍在千方百计扩展同拉丁美洲的贸易。1955年和1956年初西德、英国、荷兰、意大利等又同巴西和阿根廷等国签订了多边贸易支付协定。去年2月，一个由十七人组成的西德贸易代表团到了拉丁美洲。去年9月初日本贸易代表团在访问了墨西哥、巴拿马、哥伦比亚后到达阿根廷，代表团还将同其他南美国家商谈发展贸易问题。西德、意大利、法国、日本等国为了增加对拉丁美洲的输出正在或者已提出要在巴西、阿根廷、智利、墨西哥等国投资建立钢铁厂、汽车、拖拉机厂、肥料厂和船坞等。传说一些西欧的资本家甚至企图在美国石油垄断资本控制下的委内瑞拉投资开采石油。
    同时，由于社会主义阵营各国同拉丁美洲国家间的贸易正在平等互利的基础上逐步的开展起来，拉丁美洲各国也在加强它们之间的贸易联系。帝国主义国家在拉丁美洲的市场相应的缩小了，它们之间的矛盾也随之加深。
    帝国主义就这样加剧着它们争夺拉丁美洲市场的斗争，而且这个斗争正在日益尖锐起来。
