Dacca Dispatch

　　Forever Etched in Memory
　　By Our Correspondent Hu Qi
　　
　　In the days leading up to it, Dacca, the capital of East Pakistan, was abuzz with preparations for Premier Zhou and his delegation's visit. The main streets and buildings were adorned with thousands upon thousands of Chinese and Pakistani national flags, countless drawings with national characteristics, and slogans expressing support for world peace and friendship between China and Pakistan. Many exquisitely decorated archways were specially erected on the streets. At night, thousands upon thousands of colorful light bulbs illuminated the city in a mesmerizing way. All the buildings, including the government building, the High Court, the Chief Minister's residence, and the stadium, were decorated with flags, clusters of lights, and other beautiful ornaments. Welcome slogans in Chinese and the national emblems of China and Pakistan were also formed with light bulbs. These brightly lit buildings stood magnificently against the night sky, creating an intoxicating festive atmosphere.
　　
　　On December 28th, starting from 8:00 AM—about six hours before Premier Zhou's scheduled arrival—welcoming crowds had already begun to line up on the roads. By noon, about 50,000 people had gathered at the airport to welcome their deeply beloved Chinese guests. Due to technical difficulties, Premier Zhou's arrival in Dacca was delayed by several hours, but the enthusiasm of the welcoming crowds was not affected.
　　
　　When Premier Zhou and his delegation arrived, night had already fallen. The airport erupted in thunderous applause and surging crowds, with shouts of "Pak-Cheeni Zindabad" and other slogans resounding through the sky. Premier Zhou was warmly welcomed by Maulana Bhashani, President of the East Pakistan Awami League, who warmly embraced Premier Zhou. Prime Minister Suhrawardy also flew from Karachi to Dacca specifically to welcome Premier Zhou.
　　
　　December 29, 1956, was truly a holiday for the people of East Pakistan. The streets were colorful, decorated in splendor, and people, understanding the significance of Premier Zhou's visit, took to the streets with extraordinary joy to welcome him.
　　
　　That morning, Premier Zhou and his delegation boarded the steamer Mary Anderson and took the Sitalakhya River route to visit the huge Adamjee Jute Mills and the Dhakeshwari Cotton Mills. Both factories were built on the riverbank. Along the way, residents of villages and towns on both sides of the river and factory workers cheered for Premier Zhou to their hearts' content. On the wide riverbanks, at the docks, and on the roofs of boats, people cheered with abandon; workers climbed onto every possible place to wave greetings to Premier Zhou.
　　
　　At 3:45 PM, a mass rally was held at the stadium, attended by 200,000 people. The total population of Dacca is about 400,000. The spacious stands and the central lawn were packed with people. Tens of thousands of people crowded the streets near the square. The stadium was richly decorated. A huge arch stood in front of the gate. A beautifully decorated platform was built on top of the stands, with the national flags of both countries flying in the sky. Portraits of Jinnah and Mao Zedong were placed opposite the stadium.
　　
　　As Premier Zhou arrived at the stadium and walked towards the platform, deafening cheers echoed throughout the venue: "Pak-Cheeni Bhai Bhai" (Pak-China people are brothers), "Zindabad" (Long live). Bhashani, Premier Zhou, Suhrawardy, and Rahman each delivered friendly speeches, repeatedly eliciting cheers and applause from the crowds inside and outside the venue. When Premier Zhou ended his speech with three slogans in Bengali, he received the most enduring and enthusiastic cheers.
　　
　　In the evening, the Chief Minister hosted a banquet in honor of Premier Zhou, and fireworks were set off in the open air. This is usually used to celebrate important national holidays. There were many different kinds of fireworks, lasting for about half an hour. Tens of thousands of local people gathered around, sharing the joy of this grand festival.
　　
　　After the meeting, Premier Zhou went to the Gulistan Hall to watch a cultural performance organized by the Pakistan-China Friendship Association. Before the performance, Bhashani, President of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, in his poetic speech introducing Premier Zhou to the audience, said: "As I stand on this podium, the entire scene of the Chinese people struggling to liberate themselves from foreign chains and domestic brutal oppression flashes before my eyes. What a difficult road the Chinese people have traveled! The journey to their freedom was long, and every inch of land they traversed became sacred and fertile because it was soaked with the blood of countless martyrs. In those dark years, only leaders like the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Premier Zhou Enlai inspired the Chinese people. Today, the new buds of glorious life are growing on the land of China." He sincerely congratulated Premier Zhou. Before him, East Pakistan Chief Minister Rahman also congratulated Premier Zhou, saying: "After a period of interruption, the friendship between us, overcoming well-known obstacles, has begun to interact again." Then he added, "This cultural performance is a symbol of the new cultural exchange between the two peoples and a declaration of the eternal friendship between the two countries."
　　
　　The performance program included Pakistani folk songs, Chinese music, and a ballet. The ballet was performed in a uniquely Pakistani dance style, depicting the eternal friendship between China and Pakistan. When the curtain opened, a Chinese monk came to Pakistan and lived harmoniously with a group of people living in peace. Then, a Western aristocrat appeared, using trickery and violence to establish a regime of enslavement over the people. But the people fought, and finally broke the shackles of colonialism. At this time, a Chinese guest wearing a cadre uniform came there for friendship. Then, lively and cheerful dances were performed one after another, and the ballet ended in a joyful atmosphere.
　　
　　Amid cheers, Premier Zhou, accompanied by Bhashani, Suhrawardy, and Rahman, stepped onto the stage to congratulate the actors.
　　
　　When Premier Zhou walked out of the hall after the performance, it was already midnight. Outside the hall, he was once again greeted by hundreds of people waiting for him.
　　
　　A Pakistani official, deeply moved by the enthusiasm shown by the people of Dacca, said: "I have never seen such a scene in my life. This atmosphere should be maintained, as it has brought life to Dacca." The deep affection expressed by the people of Dacca for the Chinese people is unforgettable. (Attached pictures)

    永留记忆中
    本报记者　胡骑
    在几天以前，东巴基斯坦首府达卡为周总理和他的随行人员的访问进行了热火朝天的准备。主要街道和建筑物上装饰着成千上万的中巴两国的国旗、无数具有民族特色的图画和表示支持世界和平与中巴两国友好的标语口号。街上特地搭起了许多装饰得很精致的拱门。入夜，成千上万只五颜六色的灯泡迷人地照耀着这个城市。所有的建筑，包括政府大厦、高等法院、首席部长的住宅和运动场都挂上旗帜，装上一簇簇的灯和其他美丽的装饰品。中文的欢迎标语和中巴两国的国徽也用灯泡组成。这些照得通亮的建筑物辉煌地矗立在夜幕中，使人感到一种醉人的节日气氛。
    12月28日，从早上八时起——原定周总理到达前约六个小时——欢迎群众已经开始在马路上排成队伍。中午，约有五万人集合在机场上，欢迎即将到来的他们所深深热爱的中国客人们。由于技术上的障故，周总理飞抵达卡的时间被延迟了几小时，但欢迎的群众的热情并未因此受到影响。
    当周总理和他的随行人员到达的时候，夜幕已降临。机场上群众掌声雷动，奔走潮涌，“巴克—秦尼津达巴”与别的口号声响彻云霄。周总理受到东巴基斯坦人民联盟主席巴沙尼的热烈欢迎，他热情地同周总理拥抱。苏拉瓦底总理也特地从卡拉奇飞到达卡来欢迎周总理。
    1956年12月29日这一天，对东巴基斯坦人民说来真是一个节日。街上彩色缤纷，点缀繁华，人们体会到周总理访问的意义，都以异常欢乐的心情走上街头来迎接。
    这天上午，周总理和随行人员乘玛丽·安徒生号汽船取道锡塔拉基河，参观了巨大的阿达姆衣黄麻厂和达克希瓦里棉织厂。这两个厂都建筑在河边。一路上，河两岸村镇的居民及工厂工人都向周总理尽情欢呼。在宽阔的河的岸上，在码头上，在船顶上，人们忘情地欢呼；工人们爬上了一切可能爬上的地方向着周总理的方向招手致意。
    下午三点三刻，在体育场举行了一次群众大会，有二十万人参加。达卡的总人口约四十万。宽大的看台和中央的草地上都挤满了人。上万的人挤在广场附近的街道上。体育场浓装盛饰。大门前耸立一座巨大的拱门。看台顶上筑了一座装璜美丽的讲台，两国国旗在天空中飘扬。体育场的对面放着真纳和毛泽东的画像。
    当周总理到达体育场并向讲台走去时，满场响起了震耳欲聋的欢呼：“巴克—秦尼巴依巴依”（巴中人民是兄弟）、“津达巴”（万岁）。巴沙尼、周总理、苏拉瓦底和拉赫曼都分别作了友好演说，一再博得场内外群众的欢呼和鼓掌。当周总理用孟加拉语高呼三个口号结束演说时，他受到最经久最热烈的欢呼。
    晚上，首席部长设宴招待周总理，并在露天放起焰火。这通常是用以庆祝重要国家节日的。焰火花样极多，持续约半小时。成千成万的当地群众都围在四周，同享这盛大节日的欢乐。
    会后，周总理到古里斯坦大厅观看巴中友好协会组织的文艺表演。表演前，巴中友好协会主席巴沙尼在他向观众介绍周总理的诗歌般的演说中说：“当我站在这个讲台上的时候，中国人民为从外国锁链中和国内残暴压迫下解放出来而进行斗争的整个情景，一幕幕地掠过我的眼前。中国人民走过了多么艰难的道路！他们取得自由的路程是漫长的，他们走过的每一寸土地都因浸透了无数烈士的鲜血而变得神圣与肥沃了。在那些黑暗的岁月里，只是像已故的孙逸仙博士、毛泽东主席和周恩来总理这样的领袖才鼓舞着中国人民。今天，光荣生活的新芽正在中国的土地上生长起来。”他衷心祝贺周总理。在他以前，东巴首席部长拉赫曼也祝贺周总理说：“经过一个时期的中断以后，我们之间的友谊，越过人所共知的障碍，又开始交往了。”接着他补充说，“这次文艺表演是两国人民新的文化交流的象征，也是两国人民永恒友谊的宣誓。”
    表演节目包括巴基斯坦民歌、中国音乐和巴蕾舞剧。巴蕾舞剧是以巴基斯坦特有的舞蹈风格表演的，描写中巴两国的永恒友谊。幕开时，一个中国僧人来到巴基斯坦，和一群生活在平静中的人融洽相处。接着，出现了一个西方贵族，他运用诡计和暴力，建立了对人民的奴役统治。但是人民进行了斗争，最后终于打破了殖民主义的枷锁。这时，一位穿着干部制服的中国客人，为了亲善来到了那里。于是，接连跳起了活泼愉快的舞蹈，舞剧在欢乐的气氛中结束。
    在欢呼声中，周总理偕同巴沙尼、苏拉瓦底和拉赫曼步上舞台向演员们祝贺。
    表演结束，周总理走出大厅时，已是夜半了。在大厅外面又一次受到等待他的几百人的欢呼。
    一位给达卡人民所表现的热情深深感动了的巴基斯坦官员说：“我一生从未见过这样的场面，这种气氛应该保持下去，它们给达卡带来了生命。”达卡人民对中国人民所表达的深情厚意使人铭记不忘。（附图片）
