    The Good Thing of "Three-Way Satisfaction"
    On the eve of the Spring Festival, the members of the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, were not busy milling rice and grinding flour, but were still engaged in winter production. It turned out that the rice and flour they needed for the Spring Festival had already been prepared by the cooperative's mill.
    The Shengli Agricultural Cooperative's mill utilizes the original seven milling equipment of the cooperative members. Several elderly people and a group of old and weak horses are specifically assigned to mill rice and grind flour for the cooperative members. As long as the cooperative members send the original grain to the mill, rice and bran or flour and wheat bran will be delivered to their homes within half a day. For every hundred catties of rice milled, the cooperative members pay two work points as remuneration.
    When the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative was first established last spring, cooperative members asked for leave to mill rice or grind flour every day. The day with the most leave requests reached more than seventy people. They also competed for the cooperative's horses. Therefore, it hindered the cooperative's production. After research by the cooperative's management committee, the mill was established. The cooperative members believe that this is a "three-way satisfaction": it does not delay the agricultural cooperative's labor and horse labor, ensuring the cooperative's production; the elderly and weak horses have work to do, increasing the income of the elderly; and it is convenient to mill rice and grind flour, ensuring the living needs of the cooperative members.

    “三头满意”的好事
    春节前夕，黑龙江省肇东县胜利农业社的社员们却并不在忙着推米磨面，而仍然在忙着搞冬季生产。原来他们过春节需用的米、面，早已由社里的碾房给制好了。
    胜利农业社的碾房是利用社员原有的七个碾房设备，固定由几个老人和一批老弱马匹专门给社员碾米、磨面的。社员只要把原粮送到碾房去，半天之后，米、糠或面、麸就送到家来。每碾一百斤米，社员出两分工做为报酬。
    胜利农业社在去年春天刚建立的时候，天天有社员请假碾米或磨面，请假最多的一天曾经达到七十多人。他们还争用社里的马匹。因此，妨碍了社的生产。社的管理委员会研究以后，便建立了碾房。社员们认为这样做三头满意：不误农业社的人工和马工，保证了社的生产；老人弱马有活可做，增加了老人的收入；推米、磨面方便，保证了社员的生活需要。　（新华社）
