      "That Luang" is a very beautiful and enormous building in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, with a history of two hundred years. The height of "That Luang" is about the same as the White Pagoda in Beihai Park, and the upper part is gilded, shining brightly in the sunlight.
    Every year from November 15th to 17th in the Gregorian calendar (December 13th to 15th in the Lao calendar), the "That Luang" festival is held here, and people from all over the country come to worship. During the festival, exhibitions and sports competitions are also held.
    During the festival, the King or Crown Prince personally presides over the medal awarding ceremony.
