Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Scientific research and technical personnel at the Chinese Academy of Sciences experienced rapid growth in 1956. Scientists returning from abroad are a vibrant new force added to this scientific contingent, with over sixty of them having returned from capitalist countries.

Dr. Zhang Xiangtong, a neurophysiologist, Dr. Zhang Wenyu, a nuclear physicist, Dr. Guo Yonghuai, an aerodynamicist, Dr. Lu Yuanjiu, an automation expert, and many other scientists who recently returned from the United States possess very high levels of academic expertise. Some of their specializations are weak areas urgently needing development in our country's science. They are now all researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, working in research institutions for physics, mechanics, automation, and physiology, respectively. Among the scientists who returned from abroad to work at the Academy of Sciences in 1956, over thirty had previously obtained doctoral degrees abroad. Recently, Dr. Wang Dezhi, a physicist, also returned from France and will be working at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In the summer of 1956, over 1,400 university graduates from 115 specialties were assigned to various research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as research trainees, with nearly 800 of them being top students. After evaluation in 1956, over sixty assistant researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences were promoted to associate researchers, and thirty-eight associate researchers were promoted to researchers.

In 1956, academic committees were established in seventeen research institutes. Many academically accomplished scientists from outside the Academy were invited to participate in the academic committees, serving as academic advisors to the various research institutes.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences established a large number of new research institutions in 1956. Some of these institutions were established to meet the urgent needs of national construction and the development of scientific undertakings, filling gaps and addressing weaknesses in Chinese science. Some are the newest scientific and technological departments in the world today, and some are jointly run with institutions of higher learning. The work carried out by the Institute of Mechanics in 1956 on earthquake-resistant structures, the plasticity of metals at high temperatures, and the fluid aerodynamics of turbomachinery, etc., has significant practical implications and broad prospects for development in scientific theory and were weak links in our country's scientific work.

Among these newly established research institutions are the preparatory committees for four institutions in electronics, computing technology, semiconductors, and automation, as well as the Institute of Minority Languages, the Research Office for the History of Natural Sciences of China, the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information, the Institute of International Relations, the Changsha branch of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, and the Changchun Geological Research Office, Beijing Plant Physiology Research Office, Chongqing Soil Research Office, Wuhan Microbiology Research Office preparatory committee, and the Power Research Office, which are jointly run with institutions of higher learning. The original Psychology Research Office has been expanded into the Institute of Psychology. The fungal plant pathology research office of the original Institute of Botany has become independent as the Institute of Applied Mycology, expanding its research scope. The Institute of Physics has also undergone significant expansion. In addition, some research institutions are under preparation.

The establishment of new research institutions has received the support of central and local Party and government leading organs.

    科学研究和技术人员迅速增长
    新华社讯　中国科学院的研究人员和技术人员1956年有了迅速的增长。从外国归来的科学家是这支科学队伍里新增加的生力军，其中有六十多人是从资本主义国家归来的。
    不久前从美国回来的神经生理学家张香桐博士、原子核物理学家张文裕博士、空气动力学家郭永怀博士、自动学家陆元九博士和许多其他科学家，都有很高的学术水平，他们的专长有一些正是我国科学中急需发展的弱门；现在他们都是中国科学院的研究员，分别在物理、力学、自动化、生理学等研究机构工作。1956年从外国回来参加科学院工作的这批科学家中间，曾经在国外获得博士学位的有三十多人。最近又有物理学家汪德治博士由法国归来，也将到中国科学院工作。
    1956年暑期分配到中国科学院各研究机构中担任研究实习员的大学毕业生有一百十五个专业的一千四百多人，其中优等生将近八百人。1956年经过评级后，中国科学院有六十多个助理研究员提升为副研究员；有三十八个副研究员提升为研究员。
    1956年有十七个研究所成立了学术委员会。院外许多学术上有造诣的科学家被邀请参加了学术委员会，担任各研究所的学术指导工作。
    中国科学院在1956年新建了大批研究机构。这些机构有的是适应国家建设和发展科学事业的迫切需要而开辟的中国科学中的缺门和弱门；有的还是目前世界上最新的科学技术部门；有的是同高等院校合办的。力学研究所在1956年进行的抗震结构、高温下金属的塑性、透平机械的流体空气动力学等具有重大实际意义并且在科学理论上有广阔发展前途的工作，都是我国科学工作中原来很薄弱的环节。
    在这些新建的研究机构中，还有电子学、计算技术、半导体、自动化等四个机构的筹备委员会，少数民族语言研究所，中国自然科学史研究室，科学情报研究所，国际关系研究所，冶金陶瓷研究所长沙分所，以及同高等学校合办的长春地质研究室、北京植物生理研究室、重庆土壤研究室、武汉微生物研究室筹备委员会、动力研究室等。原来的心理研究室已经扩建为心理研究所。原来植物研究所的真菌植物病理研究室已经独立成为应用真菌学研究所，扩大了研究范围。物理研究所也有了巨大的扩充。此外，还有一些研究机构在筹建中。
    新建的研究机构得到了中央和地方党政领导机关的支持。
