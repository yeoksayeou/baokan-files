    "Ice harvesting" is one of the important sideline productions of the Oriental Red Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing. The cooperative plans to produce more than 200,000 blocks of ice from December 20 last year to January 28 this year. In addition to supplying users in a timely manner, it will also store more than 80,000 blocks for supply in the summer. It is estimated that this production alone can generate more than 80,000 yuan in income. The picture shows the Oriental Red Agricultural Cooperative supplying the produced ice to users.

    “打冰”，是北京郊区东方红农业社重要的副业生产之一。这个社计划从去年12月20日到今年1月28日共生产二十多万块，除及时供给用户外，还要贮藏八万多块，在夏季进行供应。估计，光是这项生产，就可收入八万多元。图为东方红农业社把生产出的冰供应给用户。
