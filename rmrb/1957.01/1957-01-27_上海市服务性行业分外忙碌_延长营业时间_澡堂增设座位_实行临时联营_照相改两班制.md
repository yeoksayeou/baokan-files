    新华社上海26日电　春节快到了，最近上海的服务性行业显得分外忙碌。从昨天起，全市理发店和浴池都延长二到四小时的营业时间。许多理发店已经实行临时性联合营业，在人力方面互相支援，很多私方人员家属还参加了辅助劳动。新增加的十多家临时女子理发室和四个女子浴室也已经开始接待顾客。许多澡堂增设了座位，除夕之夜还将通宵开放。
    全市照相馆这几天顾客盈门。他们还准备了大量的软片，将在春节期间为人们拍照留念。著名的万象、中国等照相馆的摄影技师们在春节期间将实行二班制。全市洗染商店，入夜仍然灯火通明，为人们赶洗节日穿的服装，并保证质量良好、约期不误。上海婚礼服务社办公室里这几天前来委订代办婚礼的男女青年络绎不绝，登记在旧历1月初1结婚的就有一百多对。
