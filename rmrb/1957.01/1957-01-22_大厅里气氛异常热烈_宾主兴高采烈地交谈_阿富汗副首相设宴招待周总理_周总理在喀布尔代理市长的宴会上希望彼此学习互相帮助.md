Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 21st. Heavy snow was falling in the Afghan capital last night, but the atmosphere at the banquet held by Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Naim Khan to entertain Premier Zhou Enlai and his party was exceptionally warm.

High-ranking Afghan military and government officials and foreign diplomatic envoys to Afghanistan attended the banquet. The host treated the guests to "Shashlik" and roast whole lamb. After the banquet, they gathered in groups of three or five in the Prime Minister's Office Hall, chatting merrily.

In one corner, Premier Zhou Enlai and Afghan Prime Minister Daoud Khan and cabinet ministers were enthusiastically discussing Afghanistan's five-year plan, which began in June last year. People heard Premier Zhou Enlai constantly asking questions, inquiring about the situation in Afghanistan's agriculture, trade, highways, bridges, and other aspects.

Laughter came from another corner of the hall. Diplomatic representatives from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, the Soviet Union, and Pakistan surrounded Vice Premier He Long. They were telling stories of the struggle against colonialism and discussing the necessity of maintaining peace and carrying out cooperation.

Earlier that afternoon, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Daoud Khan continued their talks for about four hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 21st. Kabul's Acting Mayor Khalik said at a luncheon held on the 20th to entertain Premier Zhou Enlai: We hope that Premier Zhou Enlai's current visit will strengthen the friendship between the two peoples, which will promote world peace, human prosperity, and active cooperation between countries.

Khalik pointed out that the historical links between the citizens of Kabul and the Chinese people can be traced back to the fifth century when the famous Chinese traveler Faxian visited Kabul.

Khalik said: In the seventh century, the famous Chinese scholar and pilgrim Xuanzang also lived and studied in this city. Similarly, many residents of Kabul visited China in the early days, bringing goodwill and friendship. "We are very pleased to see our ancient ties being restored."

In his reply, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The Chinese people highly respect Afghanistan's foreign policy of peace, independence, and neutrality." He said that this policy is in the interests of the people, and it makes Afghanistan's position and role in international affairs more and more important.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that the sense of justice cultivated in the hearts of the people of China and Afghanistan during the national struggle has enabled the two peoples to join hands morally. "It is precisely because of this that, in today's many international affairs, our two peoples have chosen the same just position."

Speaking of the common task of building their own countries, he expressed his pleasure at being able to learn from Afghanistan's achievements and at being able to see the large number of projects being carried out inside and outside the city of Kabul. He said that both sides have much to learn from each other and can also help each other. This is a huge and important part of the task of friendly cooperation between China and Afghanistan.

Premier Zhou hoped to make more efforts to further expand exchanges and personal contacts between the two countries in the economic, cultural, and technical fields. The Premier said that this is not only in line with the wishes and demands of the Afghan and Chinese people, but also beneficial to peace in Asia and the world.

Zhou Enlai met with the Japanese Ambassador, Miura Kazuo, in the hall and had a conversation. Zhou Enlai told the Japanese ambassador that "When Chinese and Japanese friends meet, they feel very happy because both China and Japan have undergone tremendous changes." Miura Kazuo said that Japan and China already have de facto relations. Zhou Enlai continued, "De facto relations are more important, and formal diplomatic relations will be the final step." Premier Zhou emphasized the importance of further promoting Sino-Japanese trade, cultural and scientific exchanges.

Premier Zhou Enlai also met with the French Chargé d'Affaires. The French Chargé d'Affaires had met the Premier in Chongqing before and could speak fluent Chinese. Later, the Iranian Ambassador and the Saudi Arabian Ambassador talked to Premier Zhou Enlai about the so-called vacuum in the Middle East. Zhou Enlai quoted Nasser as saying that even if such a vacuum exists, it should be filled by the people of the Middle East themselves, not by outsiders.

    周总理在喀布尔代理市长的宴会上希望彼此学习互相帮助
    新华社喀布尔21日电　阿富汗首都昨晚下着鹅毛大雪，而在阿富汗副首相兼外交大臣纳伊姆汗为招待周恩来总理一行而举行的宴会上，气氛却热烈异常。
    阿富汗的高级军政人员和各国驻阿富汗外交使节都参加了这次宴会。主人招待客人们吃“沙希利克”和烤全羊。宴会后，他们在首相府的大厅里，三五成群聚在一起，兴高采烈地交谈着。
    在一个角落里，周恩来总理同阿富汗首相达乌德汗和内阁大臣们正在热心地谈论着去年6月开始实行的阿富汗五年计划。人们听到周恩来总理不断地提出问题，询问有关阿富汗农业、贸易、公路、桥梁等方面的情况。
    大厅的另一角落里传来了笑声。沙特阿拉伯、埃及、伊朗、苏联和巴基斯坦各国的外交代表把贺龙副总理围了起来。他们正在讲述反对殖民主义斗争中的故事，并且讨论维护和平和进行合作的必要性。
    在当天下午较早的时候，周恩来总理同达乌德汗首相继续进行了约四小时的会谈。
    新华社喀布尔21日电　喀布尔代理市长哈利克20日中午在为招待周恩来总理而举行的宴会上说：我们希望，周恩来总理目前的这次访问将加强两国人民之间的友谊，这种友谊将促进世界和平、人类繁荣和各国之间的积极合作。
    哈利克指出，喀布尔公民和中国人民之间的历史联系可以追溯到第五世纪，当时著名的中国旅行家法显曾经访问了喀布尔。
    哈利克说：在第七世纪，著名的中国学者和香客玄奘也曾经在这个城市里住过、学习过。同样，有许多喀布尔的居民在很早的日子曾经访问过中国，他们带去了善意和友谊。“我们十分愉快地看到我们之间的古老联系正在恢复。” 
    周恩来总理在致答词时说：“中国人民十分尊重阿富汗所奉行的和平、独立和中立的外交政策。”他说，这个政策是符合人民利益的，它使得阿富汗在国际事务中的地位和作用愈来愈重要。
    周恩来总理指出，阿中两国人民在民族斗争过程中在他们的心里培养起来的正义感，使得两国人民在道义上携起手来。“正是由于这一点，可以在今天的许多国际事务中，我们两国人民选择了相同的正义立场。”
    他在谈到建设自己祖国的共同任务时，对于能够从阿富汗所取得的成就中学习、对于能够亲眼看到喀布尔城里城外正在进行着的大批工程，表示很高兴。他说，双方都有许多东西可以彼此学习，也可以彼此进行帮助。这就是中阿友好合作的任务中一项巨大的重要的内容。
    周总理希望作更多的努力来进一步扩大两国在经济、文化和技术方面的交流和个人接触。总理说，这不仅符合阿富汗人民和中国人民的愿望和要求，而且有益于亚洲和世界和平。
    周恩来在大厅里同日本大使三浦和一见了面，并且作了交谈。周恩来告诉日本大使说：“当中国和日本的朋友们见面时，他们感到非常高兴，因为中国和日本都发生了巨大的变化。”三浦和一说，日本和中国已经有了事实上的关系。周恩来接着说，“事实上的关系更为重要，正式的外交关系将是最后的一步。”周总理强调了进一步促进中日贸易、文化和科学交流的重要性。
    周恩来总理还同法国代办见了面。法国代办从前在重庆曾同总理见过面，他能够说一口流利的中国话。后来伊朗大使和沙特阿拉伯大使同周恩来总理谈所谓中近东的真空。周恩来引述纳赛尔的话说，即使假定存在着这种真空，它也应当由中近东人民自己来填补，而不应当由外来人来填补。
