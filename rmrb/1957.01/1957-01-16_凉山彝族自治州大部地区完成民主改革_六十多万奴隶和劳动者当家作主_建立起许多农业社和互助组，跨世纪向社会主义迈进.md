Xinhua News Agency Report by Yu Jingqi: The democratic reform work in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, which has liberated millions of slaves and working people, has been completed in areas accounting for 80% of the prefecture's population.

Since February 1956, democratic reforms have been carried out in two phases in more than 310 townships with a population of more than 650,000, and together with the 31 Han Chinese inhabited townships in the marginal areas where land reform was carried out two years ago, the population of the reformed areas has reached more than 770,000.

More than 600,000 Yi "Guozhuang Wa Zi" (slaves), "Anjia Wa Zi" (semi-slaves), and landless and land-poor peasants were liberated in the reform, each receiving one to three mu of land. Among them, 40,000 slaves left the homes of slave owners and began a life of freedom.

The reform was decided by the People's Representative Conference of the Autonomous Prefecture held in February 1956. The reform required the abolition of the slave system and various political and economic privileges of the slave-owner class, the abolition of slave-owner land ownership, and the opening of a path for the Yi people to embark on socialism. Before the reform, the slave-owner class, which accounted for only about 5% of the total population of the prefecture, possessed about half of the slaves and semi-slaves of the social labor force, and ruled and exploited the entire working people in terms of subordinate relationships, occupying most of the cultivated land.

In the years after the implementation of regional autonomy in the Liangshan area, the local people's governments mediated tens of thousands of "fighting vendetta" disputes, cultivated a large number of ethnic minority cadres, and absorbed more than 1,000 upper-class people to participate in the work, fundamentally changing the serious situation of ethnic estrangement and internal discord left over from history, thereby laying a good foundation for reform.

When the good news of the reform spread to the rural areas of the autonomous prefecture, thousands of slave masses rushed to the people's government to request to participate in the reform work. In Butuo, Zhaojue, and other counties, hundreds of people went to the county people's committees to make requests in just over a week. After the reform began, more than 190,000 working people throughout the prefecture actively signed up to participate in the Labor People's Association—the organization that implements the reform. The broad masses of working people actively participated in a series of activities such as negotiations with slave owners for peaceful reform, as well as speaking out about suffering, confiscation, and distribution. More than 70,000 people participated in the armed self-defense forces to protect the reform work. According to the principle of peaceful reform and the characteristics of Yi society, the people's governments and upper-class Yi people conducted repeated consultations before and during the reform. During the reform, measures such as not killing, not struggling, not digging up old wealth, and not settling old accounts were taken against slave owners. In addition to leaving them with a portion of land equivalent to that of the working people, surplus houses, livestock, farm tools, and grain were purchased, and all other property was left untouched. These measures were supported by the upper-class people, and many people actively assisted in the reform work. In the course of the reform, more than 1,800 people were absorbed into the work of the various levels of the CPPCC and other work according to their wishes.

These days, in the fields and mountain villages of Liangshan, scenes of people who have completed the reform actively building their homes are appearing everywhere. About 20,000 slaves have returned to their homes and reunited with their relatives.

The liberated slaves, semi-slaves, and laborers joyfully embarked on the road to socialism. After the people's government issued the call to establish agricultural production cooperatives and organize mutual aid teams, moving scenes of entire families signing up and spontaneously organizing themselves to ask the government to send cadres to help appeared in many places. In some areas, almost 100% of the liberated slaves joined the cooperatives or teams. According to statistics from the 12 counties of the autonomous prefecture, more than 610 agricultural cooperatives and more than 7,000 mutual aid teams have been established, and the number of farmers who have joined the cooperatives and teams has reached 40% of the total number of farmers.

More than 60 advanced agricultural cooperatives mainly organized by former slaves and semi-slaves have been established in the Yi inhabited areas.

Many agricultural cooperatives have begun to take the lead in improving farming techniques, learning intensive farming and water conservancy, and Puge County alone has built and repaired more than 110 new and old ditches and reclaimed more than 4,000 mu of wasteland. The prefecture's grain output last year increased by more than 10% compared with the year before the reform.

The liberated slaves have begun to be masters of their own affairs in Liangshan. More than 10,000 activists in the reform—former slaves and laborers—have mostly participated in work or become the backbone of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams. In more than 300 townships after the reform, many activists have served as township heads, militia captains, and other positions. Some have been absorbed into the Chinese Communist Party and served as secretaries of the CCP branch. In Zhaojue and Meigu counties, 12 district heads and deputy district heads were former slaves.

At present, the reform work in more than 90 townships with a population of about 180,000 in the prefecture is being actively prepared. In the areas where reform has been completed, the mutual aid and cooperation movement is continuing to develop. Thousands of rural cadres and activists are vigorously carrying out publicity and organizational work in the countryside.

### 凉山彝族自治州大部地区完成民主改革  六十多万奴隶和劳动者当家作主  建立起许多农业社和互助组，跨世纪向社会主义迈进

    凉山彝族自治州大部地区完成民主改革
    六十多万奴隶和劳动者当家作主
    建立起许多农业社和互助组，跨世纪向社会主义迈进
    据新华社讯　新华社记者于竞祁报道：凉山彝族自治州使千万奴隶和劳动人民获得自由解放的民主改革工作，已经在占全州人口80％的地区完成。
    从1956年2月以来，全州有三百一十多个乡六十五万多人口的地区分两批进行了民主改革，连同两年以前已经土地改革的三十一个边沿区的汉族聚居乡，完成改革的地区人口共计已经达到七十七万多。
    六十多万彝族“锅庄娃子”（奴隶）、“安家娃子”（半奴隶）和无地缺地的农民，在改革中获得解放，每人分到了一亩到三亩土地。其中有四万奴隶走出奴隶主的家，开始了自由生活。
    这次改革是1956年2月份举行的自治州人民代表会议决定的。这次改革要求废除奴隶制度和奴隶主阶级各种政治、经济特权，废除奴隶主土地所有制，为彝族人民走上社会主义开辟道路。在改革以前，只占全州总人口5％左右的奴隶主阶级共占有着占社会劳动力一半左右的奴隶和半奴隶；并在从属关系上统治和剥削着全体劳动人民，占有着大部分耕地。
    在凉山地区实行区域自治后的几年中，各地人民政府调解了上万件“打冤家”的纠纷，培养了大批民族干部，并且吸收了一千多上层人士参加工作，使历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂和内部不和的严重情况有了根本改变，从而为改革打下了良好的基础。
    当改革的喜讯传到自治州农村中的时候，数以千计的奴隶群众纷纷跑到人民政府来要求参加改革工作，布拖、昭觉等县在一个多星期中就有几百人到县人民委员会提出请求。改革开始后，全州有十九万多劳动人民积极报名参加劳动人民协会——执行改革的组织。广大劳动群众积极参加了和奴隶主进行和平改革的谈判和诉苦、没收、分配等一系列的活动。七万多人参加了保卫改革工作的武装自卫队。根据和平改革方针和彝族社会特点，在改革前和改革中各地人民政府和彝族上层人士进行了反复的协商。在改革中对奴隶主采取了不杀、不斗、不挖底财、不算老账等办法，除留给他们相当于劳动人民同样的一份土地以外，多余的房屋、耕畜、农具、粮食都采取征购方式，其他财产一律不动。这些措施得到上层人士的拥护，不少人积极地协助改革工作。在改革过程中，各地根据他们的意愿又吸收了一千八百多人参加了各级政协的工作和其他工作。
    这些日子中，在凉山的田野、山村里，到处出现了完成改革的人们积极建设自己家园的景象。约有两万个奴隶回到自己家里和亲人团聚。
    获得解放的奴隶、半奴隶和劳动者们兴高采烈地走上了社会主义道路。人民政府发出建立农业生产合作社、组织互助组的号召后，许多地方都出现全家报名、自动组织起来要求政府派干部帮助的动人情景。有些地区被解放的奴隶，几乎百分之百的入社或入组。据自治州十二个县统计，目前已经建立了六百一十多个农业社和七千多个互助组，入社、入组的农户已经达到总农户的40％。
    六十多个主要由过去的奴隶、半奴隶组织的高级农业社已经在彝族聚居区建立起来。
    许多农业社开始带头改进耕作技术，学习深耕细作和兴修水利，只普格县一个县就修建修复新旧沟堰一百一十多条，开荒四千多亩。全州去年粮食产量比改革前一年增加一成多。
    获得解放的奴隶，开始在凉山当家作主人。一万多名改革中的积极分子——从前的奴隶和劳动者，今天已经大部参加了工作或者成为农业社、互助组的骨干。在三百多个改革后的乡里，有许多积极分子担任了乡长、民兵队长等职务。有的被吸收参加了中国共产党，担任了中共支部书记。昭觉、美姑两个县就有十二个区长、副区长是由过去的奴隶担任的。
    目前，全州还有九十多个乡约十八万人口的地区的改革工作正在积极准备。在已经完成改革的地区，互助合作运动还在继续发展。成千的乡村干部和积极分子正在农村中大力开展宣传和组织工作。
