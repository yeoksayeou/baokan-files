      "Lazy Wife Snatching the Market," also known as "Fat Boy Teasing the Lion," is a dance program performed by the Xi'an People's Song and Dance Troupe at the National Professional Performing Arts Festival. Through the conflict between a lazy wife and a green lion (the lazy wife doesn't want to work and wants to sleep, and the green lion makes trouble for her), it humorously satirizes the lazy wife who doesn't like to work. The green lion has always been regarded as the king of beasts that can ward off evil spirits; therefore, in many occasions, it is depicted as being majestic and mighty. However, in this program, it is a gentle, understanding, and representative of opposition to the lazy wife. Such a depiction expresses a theme with realistic significance. After watching this program, we cannot help but once again admire the wisdom and outstanding artistic talent of our folk artists.
 
      "Lazy Wife Snatching the Market" was originally a folk dance from southern Shaanxi. This performance has been processed by professional workers. In terms of content, it is relatively complete; in terms of performance, the actors can break through the limitations of the mask and convey the emotional changes of the characters, achieving the desired effect. I think this program is not only an excellent dance work, but more importantly, it gives us great inspiration—inspiring us to create more dance styles.
 
    Several years ago, someone proposed to enrich dance styles, but there has not been much improvement. "Lazy Wife Snatching the Market" provides us with a new style of "satirical dance": just as there are satirical poems, satirical paintings, and satirical dramas, there can also be satirical dances. I remember there was a similar story in Hunan called "Spring Ox," which described a lazy couple who would let their oxen graze in the wild during the winter slack season; when spring came and other families had already started spring plowing, they would remember to go to the wild to find their oxen. There are also many interesting details of life in between. "Lazy Wife Snatching the Market" not only inspires us to pay attention to this aspect of materials and creation, but also inspires us to pay attention to exploring various styles of folk dance in many ways. Recently, a life custom dance called "Accompanying the Bride," which was discovered in Hunan, has a strong lyrical atmosphere and is a moving chapter in the historical epic of people's lives. This dance style undoubtedly also needs to be collected and organized. (Attached picture)

    “懒婆娘抢场”及其他
    景琛
      “懒婆娘抢场”又名“胖娃闹狮”，是西安人民歌舞剧团在全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演上演出的一个舞蹈节目。它通过懒婆娘和青狮之间的纠纷（懒婆娘不想干活，想睡觉，青狮跟她捣乱），富有趣味地嘲讽了不爱劳动的懒婆娘。青狮一直被人们当作能辟邪驱祟的兽中王；因此，在很多场合中是被描写成威武雄伟的样子的。但在这个节目里，它却是一个温顺的、通达人情的、反对懒婆娘的代表者。这样的描写，表现了富有现实意义的主题思想。看了这个节目，使我们不禁要再一次地赞叹我们民间艺人的智慧和卓越的艺术才能。
      “懒婆娘抢场”原来是陕南的民间舞蹈，这次演出是经过专业工作者加工的。在内容上，比较完整；在表演上，演员能够突破面具的限制，传达出人物的情绪变化，达到了预期的效果。我觉得这个节目不仅是一个优秀的舞蹈作品，更主要的是它给了我们很大的启发——启发我们去创造更多的舞蹈样式。
    几年前就有人提出了要丰富舞蹈样式，但是改进得并不多。“懒婆娘抢场”为我们提供了“讽刺舞蹈”这一新的样式：像有讽刺诗、讽刺画、讽刺剧一样，同样也可以有讽刺舞蹈。记得在湖南也有一个类似的素材“春牛”，内容描写一对好吃懒做的夫妇，到冬闲的时候就把耕牛放到野地里去；等到春天，别人家已经在开始春耕的时候，他们才想起到野地里去把牛找回来。中间也有不少有趣的生活细节。“懒婆娘抢场”不仅仅启发了我们要注意这一方面的素材和创作，也启发了我们应该多方面地注意发掘各种样式的民间舞蹈。最近，在湖南发现的一种生活习俗舞蹈“伴嫁”，具有浓郁的抒情气氛，是人民生活历史诗篇中感人的一章。这种舞蹈样式，无疑地同样有加以收集和整理的必要。（附图片）
